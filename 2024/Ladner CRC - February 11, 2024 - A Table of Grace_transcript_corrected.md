[347.00 → 349.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[349.00 → 351.00] My name is Jason True.
[351.00 → 352.00] I'm one of the pastors here.
[352.00 → 356.00] And it is my joy to worship the Lord with you this morning.
[356.00 → 358.00] So today is the Lord's Day.
[358.00 → 359.00] It's the first day of the week.
[359.00 → 363.00] It's the day when we gather to give God the glory.
[363.00 → 370.00] But today is also a special day because it is Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year.
[370.00 → 374.00] And so Happy New Year to all of our Chinese brothers and sisters.
[374.00 → 376.00] Pinyin, Kwame LE.
[378.00 → 379.00] Thank you.
[382.00 → 385.00] So just a few announcements before we begin.
[385.00 → 390.00] We have a congregational meeting coming up on February the 28th.
[390.00 → 392.00] So Wednesday at 7 p.m.
[392.00 → 395.00] So please save that date in your calendars.
[395.00 → 400.00] And I hope that we can come together as a church family on that day, February 28th.
[400.00 → 406.00] And I think that's about all for now.
[406.00 → 416.00] And so we are here today because God Almighty, the Lord, the Creator of the universe, has called us to worship Him.
[416.00 → 424.00] And so people of God, let's begin our time of worship this morning with our call to worship from Psalm 111.
[424.00 → 427.00] The words will be on the screen here behind me.
[427.00 → 429.00] And I will read it for us.
[429.00 → 432.00] Praise the Lord.
[432.00 → 438.00] I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
[438.00 → 441.00] Great are the works of the Lord.
[441.00 → 444.00] They are pondered by all who delight in them.
[444.00 → 448.00] Glorious and majestic are His deeds.
[448.00 → 453.00] And His righteousness endures forever.
[453.00 → 460.00] Please join me in prayer as we come before the Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[460.00 → 464.00] Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning.
[464.00 → 467.00] We bow our hearts before you.
[467.00 → 471.00] We extol your name with all of our hearts.
[471.00 → 478.00] We praise you for your goodness and your loving kindness to us and to all whom you have made.
[478.00 → 480.00] Great are your deeds, O Lord.
[480.00 → 483.00] We take delight in them.
[483.00 → 486.00] And your righteousness indeed does endure forever.
[486.00 → 491.00] Thank you for remembering your covenant with us and for keeping your promise
[491.00 → 497.00] and sending your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to redeem us from sin, death, and the devil,
[497.00 → 500.00] and to make us your people forever.
[500.00 → 502.00] And we thank you for the hope of glory.
[502.00 → 506.00] We adore you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[506.00 → 511.00] And to you belongs all honour and glory throughout all ages.
[511.00 → 512.00] Amen.
[512.00 → 523.00] Let's all stand, and we will hear God's greeting to us this morning from the Old Testament prophet of Malachi.
[523.00 → 530.00] From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name will be great among the nations.
[530.00 → 536.00] And in every place, incense will be offered to my name and a pure offering.
[536.00 → 542.00] For my name will be great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.
[542.00 → 548.00] So as the Lord has called us and greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another, saying Happy New Year or...

[1065.60 → 1069.48] HECKS
[1069.48 → 1076.38] One more time.
[1076.38 → 1083.78] Blessings from the Lord are like great in Spain.
[1084.36 → 1090.38] I will be praised and rejoiced in Him.
[1091.58 → 1097.78] Like from the Lord, He is a fountain.
[1097.78 → 1104.88] Well, He loved me and still my life.
[1105.26 → 1108.72] Hold us up in your arms and praise.
[1109.16 → 1112.02] Lift our hands in worship.
[1113.02 → 1118.88] Blessing from the Lord will be among us.
[1118.88 → 1125.98] Let us up in your glory.
[1125.98 → 1132.98] Glory be to the Lord.
[1132.98 → 1137.16] The Lord will give, fail.
[1137.68 → 1140.08] Place like the rain.
[1141.28 → 1145.24] Rain showers and spring.
[1145.24 → 1149.88] Thank you, Wally.
[1149.88 → 1149.90] Thank you, Wally.
[1150.40 → 1166.44] So I imagine we're breaking new ground there because I think that was the first time that song's ever been sung in English in a church.
[1166.52 → 1168.10] I don't know, but so that's pretty cool.
[1168.10 → 1175.24] So we are called, you know, week by week to come and bring our hearts to God in worship.
[1175.24 → 1185.86] But also when we come, we bring to Him those things that do not belong in our hearts and that keep us from worship.
[1186.62 → 1190.08] And so we bring those things to God in repentance.
[1190.08 → 1196.72] So let us join with Daniel in confessing this morning.
[1198.30 → 1205.58] And as I read it, I would encourage you to be praying in your hearts to God.
[1206.58 → 1210.84] Okay, so let's use these words from Daniel to confess our sins.
[1211.14 → 1213.38] And please pray along as I read it for us.
[1213.38 → 1224.90] The Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of love with those who love Him and keep His commandments.
[1226.04 → 1228.64] We have sinned and done wrong.
[1229.18 → 1231.16] We have been wicked and have rebelled.
[1231.82 → 1238.62] We have turned away from your commands and laws and have not listened to your servants, the prophets.
[1239.90 → 1243.20] So please take a moment of silent confession right now.
[1243.38 → 1268.86] Father, again, we praise you because you are the great and awesome God.
[1268.86 → 1276.00] Lord, you are the God whose love is from everlasting, and you have kept an oath and made a covenant with us.
[1276.46 → 1279.32] That you would keep it even when we fall into sin.
[1280.24 → 1281.30] But Lord, you are faithful.
[1282.16 → 1289.90] You are faithful in sending your Son to die on the cross that we might be brought back into a right relationship with you.
[1289.90 → 1296.86] And so, Lord, when we come to you in worship, would you take those things in our hearts that are preventing us from worshipping you.
[1297.66 → 1303.94] And Lord, would you help us to put those aside, Lord, and to turn to you in faith.
[1304.38 → 1308.28] By your grace and your mercy, we thank you, and we pray in Jesus' name.
[1308.50 → 1308.74] Amen.
[1308.74 → 1316.82] Now, let's stand now and hear these words that assure us of God's forgiveness.
[1317.06 → 1318.26] And pardon, please rise.
[1318.96 → 1320.68] This quick verse from Ephesians 1.
[1320.68 → 1332.90] In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins according to the riches of God's grace.
[1333.12 → 1334.10] Thanks be to God.
[1334.64 → 1337.80] Let's sing another song here, In Christ Alone.
[1338.24 → 1338.70] Let's sing.
[1338.70 → 1352.96] In Christ Alone.
[1352.96 → 1355.44] I know this vow.
[1355.98 → 1360.46] He is my life, my strength, my soul.
[1360.96 → 1365.34] This gorgeous soul, this solid crown.
[1365.34 → 1370.14] From the pieces, strong and stone.
[1370.78 → 1375.14] My heights of love, my depths of peace.
[1375.52 → 1380.18] When fears are still, which striving cease.
[1380.66 → 1385.54] My home could live, my home in all.
[1386.02 → 1390.20] Here in the love of Christ I stand.
[1390.20 → 1391.20] Amen.
[1395.34 → 1399.52] Amen.
[1407.60 → 1408.74] Amen.
[1408.74 → 1409.44] Amen.

[1451.46 → 1452.94] the sow
[1452.94 → 1459.08] He lay, light of the world by darkness slain.
[1459.08 → 1468.72] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1469.12 → 1478.54] And as He stands in victory, His curse has lost His grip on me.
[1478.54 → 1489.64] For I am His, and He is mine, from the precious blood of Christ.
[1489.64 → 1496.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1496.64 → 1502.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1502.64 → 1509.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1509.64 → 1515.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1515.64 → 1522.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1522.64 → 1528.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1528.64 → 1535.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1535.64 → 1539.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1539.64 → 1566.64] The mercy of God in forest day, how from the grave He rose again.
[1566.64 → 1572.98] As we prepare to partake of the Lord's Supper together this morning,
[1573.62 → 1576.20] let us confess our faith together,
[1576.98 → 1581.12] say together what we believe using the words of the Nicene Creed.
[1581.36 → 1587.88] So it's a bit long, but let's say it out loud together in English or in Chinese.
[1588.36 → 1589.56] Let's say it together.
[1590.40 → 1593.98] We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
[1593.98 → 1600.18] maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
[1601.24 → 1605.96] And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,
[1606.50 → 1609.94] begotten from the Father before all ages,
[1610.76 → 1616.04] God from God, light from light, true God from true God,
[1616.48 → 1621.30] begotten, not made, of the same substance as the Father.
[1621.30 → 1624.68] Through him all things were made.
[1625.26 → 1629.90] For us and for our salvation, he came down from heaven.
[1630.56 → 1637.34] He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made human.
[1638.28 → 1641.82] He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.
[1642.40 → 1644.36] He suffered and was buried.
[1645.06 → 1649.00] The third day he rose again according to the scriptures.
[1649.00 → 1654.68] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[1655.34 → 1660.22] He will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead.
[1660.72 → 1662.84] His kingdom will never end.
[1663.74 → 1668.56] And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life.
[1669.26 → 1672.12] He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
[1672.12 → 1677.10] and with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified.
[1677.76 → 1679.54] He spoke through the prophets.
[1680.46 → 1685.00] We believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.
[1685.42 → 1689.60] We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
[1690.22 → 1693.22] We look forward to the resurrection of the dead
[1693.22 → 1696.42] and to life in the world to come.
[1697.02 → 1697.44] Amen.
[1697.44 → 1703.02] So brothers and sisters, as we come to this table,
[1703.94 → 1707.40] one of the things that this table helps us to do
[1707.40 → 1714.74] is to remember how Jesus willingly gave his life for us on the cross.
[1714.74 → 1722.30] And he did so in order to bring us back into a right relationship with God.
[1723.12 → 1726.22] And so that's what we come, and we remember and celebrate
[1726.22 → 1729.68] as we eat the bread, and we drink the cup.
[1730.54 → 1732.72] If you are a Christian today,
[1732.84 → 1735.12] if you have been baptized in the name of Jesus,
[1735.12 → 1742.54] Jesus invites you to come and to taste just how loved you are
[1742.54 → 1745.08] as you eat this bread and drink it.
[1746.22 → 1749.84] If you are not yet a Christian here today,
[1750.42 → 1752.32] this table is not yet for you.
[1753.22 → 1755.74] And so even as the bread and the cup are passed to you,
[1755.82 → 1757.72] please do not take it, but just pass it along.
[1758.58 → 1760.28] And my encouragement to you
[1760.28 → 1763.24] is that you would instead receive Christ,
[1763.24 → 1765.90] that you would receive him by faith
[1765.90 → 1767.76] and put your trust in him.
[1767.80 → 1769.94] And if that's something you want to learn more about,
[1770.40 → 1772.52] please do come talk to me after the service
[1772.52 → 1773.84] or find Pastor Nancy.
[1774.20 → 1776.82] And we would love to help you understand more
[1776.82 → 1779.44] about what the Christian faith
[1779.44 → 1781.30] and believing in Jesus is all about.
[1784.06 → 1785.48] And so let us pray
[1785.48 → 1789.18] and we will ask for the Lord's blessing upon this sacrament.
[1789.40 → 1790.00] Let's pray together.
[1790.00 → 1792.98] Our Father in heaven,
[1793.16 → 1794.66] would you send your Holy Spirit
[1794.66 → 1798.08] so that this bread and cup may be for us
[1798.08 → 1801.02] the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1801.68 → 1803.28] As we come to your table,
[1803.78 → 1805.84] would you prepare our hearts
[1805.84 → 1808.04] to receive you by faith
[1808.04 → 1810.46] and to commune with you
[1810.46 → 1812.54] because you are present here with us.
[1813.66 → 1814.76] Bless this meal, Lord,
[1814.82 → 1816.34] to you the glory of your name
[1816.34 → 1818.42] and the good of your people.
[1819.02 → 1820.42] We ask in Christ's name.
[1820.78 → 1821.04] Amen.
[1823.18 → 1824.16] The Lord Jesus,
[1824.32 → 1825.66] on the night when he was betrayed,
[1825.82 → 1826.56] he took bread.
[1827.20 → 1828.42] And when he had given thanks,
[1828.48 → 1829.24] he broke it.
[1829.86 → 1830.36] He said,
[1830.50 → 1831.70] This is my body,
[1831.78 → 1832.54] which is for you.
[1833.28 → 1835.58] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1836.58 → 1837.66] The same way,
[1837.80 → 1839.32] he took the cup after supper,
[1839.32 → 1839.70] saying,
[1839.84 → 1841.30] This cup is the new covenant
[1841.30 → 1842.90] in my blood.
[1843.64 → 1845.28] As often as you drink it,
[1845.72 → 1847.40] do it in remembrance of me.
[1848.04 → 1849.84] For as often as you eat this bread
[1849.84 → 1851.04] and you drink this cup,
[1851.38 → 1852.88] you proclaim the Lord's death
[1852.88 → 1854.82] until he comes again.
[1856.58 → 1857.84] So brothers and sisters,
[1857.98 → 1859.20] let's say these words
[1859.20 → 1861.28] of our communion liturgy together.
[1862.96 → 1864.24] Lift your hearts.
[1864.24 → 1869.38] We are his people.
[1872.42 → 1874.86] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1876.00 → 1876.86] Christ has died.
[1877.28 → 1878.24] Christ is risen.
[1878.84 → 1880.16] Christ will come again.
[1880.96 → 1882.20] Christ, our Passover,
[1882.36 → 1884.02] has been sacrificed for us.
[1884.42 → 1884.74] Hallelujah.
[1886.74 → 1887.70] Brothers and sisters,
[1887.70 → 1889.24] these are the gifts of God
[1889.24 → 1891.58] for you, his people.
[1892.60 → 1894.08] May I ask our elders
[1894.08 → 1895.38] to come forward at this time
[1895.38 → 1897.16] to help me distribute the elements.
[1897.16 → 1897.66] Amen.
[1924.62 → 1927.16] lay...
[1927.16 → 1927.24] what a word
[1927.24 → 1927.40] to come forward at them.
[1939.36 → 1939.84] Amen.
[1942.18 → 1942.44] Let's pray.
[1942.44 → 1972.42] Thank you.
[1972.44 → 2002.42] Thank you.
[2002.44 → 2032.42] Thank you.
[2032.44 → 2062.42] Thank you.
[2062.44 → 2092.42] Thank you.
[2092.44 → 2122.42] Thank you.
[2122.44 → 2152.42] Thank you.
[2152.44 → 2182.42] Thank you.
[2182.44 → 2212.42] Thank you.
[2212.44 → 2242.42] Thank you.
[2242.44 → 2272.42] Thank you.
[2272.44 → 2302.42] Thank you.
[2302.44 → 2332.42] Thank you.
[2332.44 → 2362.42] Thank you.
[2362.44 → 2392.42] Thank you.
[2392.44 → 2405.64] God most high, we thank you for welcoming us, for hosting us, for feeding us, Lord, with your broken body, your shed blood, by your grace and your mercy.
[2405.64 → 2435.62] Thank you.
[2435.64 → 2465.62] Thank you.
[2465.62 → 2495.60] Thank you.
[2495.62 → 2525.60] Thank you.
[2525.62 → 2555.60] Thank you.
[2555.60 → 2585.58] Thank you.
[2585.60 → 2615.58] Thank you.
[2615.60 → 2645.58] Thank you.
[2645.60 → 2675.58] Thank you.
[2675.60 → 2705.58] Thank you.
[2705.62 → 2735.58] Thank you.
[2735.58 → 2737.58] Thank you.
[2765.58 → 2795.56] Thank you.
[2795.56 → 2825.56] Thank you.
[2825.56 → 2855.54] Thank you.
[2855.56 → 2885.56] Thank you.
[2885.56 → 2915.54] This is the last one.
[2915.54 → 2945.54] 
[2945.54 → 2975.52] This is the word of the word of the Lord.
[2975.52 → 3005.52] And we're here, the Lord's Supper together.
[3005.52 → 3035.50] And we'll look at the passage, we're we're here, we're here.
[3035.50 → 3041.08] and his disciples are again they're having a meal they're having a meal together so intimate setting
[3041.08 → 3048.56] but this is a very special meal it's a meal that the Jewish people celebrated annually
[3048.56 → 3055.94] called the Passover when what so what they were celebrating with this Passover meal
[3055.94 → 3064.20] was the Exodus account when God delivered his people out of slavery in Egypt with a mighty hand
[3064.20 → 3074.44] and it's a story that went all the way back to the time of Moses Jacob the patriarch Jacob and his family
[3074.44 → 3083.62] had gone to Egypt as refugees because of a famine in the land but the land that began as a land of
[3083.62 → 3091.06] deliverance became a place of oppression the people of God became enslaved in the land of Egypt
[3091.06 → 3101.42] for 400 years, but God heard the cry of his people in their suffering, and he sent Moses and God did and
[3101.42 → 3107.94] you know many of you know the story God did many miracles and plagues to humble Pharaoh so that he
[3107.94 → 3116.30] would set his people free, but Pharaoh's heart was hard and this too was the hand of God so Egypt
[3116.30 → 3126.20] was ruined by the increasing severity of the plagues that were unleashed on the land and on its crops and
[3126.20 → 3134.44] its rivers and on its animals, but the last plague was the most severe and so on the night of this final
[3134.44 → 3142.66] plague God instructed his people to eat a special meal we read about it in Exodus 12 here's just a bit
[3142.66 → 3149.50] this is how you are to eat it with your cloak tucked into your belt your sandals on your feet and your
[3149.50 → 3158.14] staff in your hand eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover on that same night I will pass through Egypt
[3158.14 → 3165.90] and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals and I will bring judgment on all the gods of
[3165.90 → 3176.94] Egypt I am the Lord so the firstborn of every animal and of every household in Egypt was going to be killed
[3176.94 → 3186.64] in a single awful night and Israel was given a meal to remind them forever of how God delivered them from
[3186.64 → 3194.40] the hand of Pharaoh in Egypt and if you know the story you may remember what they ate at this meal
[3194.40 → 3205.58] the centre of the meal was what a lamb they were to eat the meat roasted over a fire with bitter herbs
[3205.58 → 3214.42] and bread made without yeast and bread made without yeast and the whole lamb was to be eaten the head the legs the
[3214.42 → 3227.94] inner parts but not a bone was to be broken and only one part of the lamb was not roasted in the hurry of the meal
[3227.94 → 3236.56] and this was the blood Jews by God's law were never to eat the blood it was seen as the life
[3236.56 → 3245.38] and therefore it belonged to God, and it would return to God right this life comes from God and the life
[3245.38 → 3253.54] returns to God but at this Passover meal the blood of the lamb was not to be eaten it was to be put on the
[3253.54 → 3260.40] doorposts of the house the houses of the people of Israel it was the blood that caused that angel of
[3260.40 → 3270.32] judgment to pass over and spare the house in mercy the blood was the means of grace the sacrifice of
[3270.32 → 3280.18] another meant that you could be saved and the people of God were to celebrate and remember this over a meal
[3280.18 → 3286.98] and they were to say as they took this meal year after year they were to say
[3286.98 → 3291.76] this is what we remember that God delivered us
[3291.76 → 3297.04] there would be a host of the meal, and often they would gather together as a family
[3297.04 → 3304.80] and the kids or the youngest in the family would ask the question of what is this all about what does this meal mean
[3304.80 → 3314.76] and they would retell the story year after year and there would be moments of singing in the Hillel in the psalms
[3314.76 → 3323.82] so what was striking is when the disciples heard Jesus say do this in remembrance of me
[3323.82 → 3331.04] they would have been like we haven't heard that one before we've been doing this our whole lives
[3331.04 → 3337.62] and Jesus comes, and he changes it he says do this in remembrance of me
[3337.62 → 3345.78] because what Jesus is saying is all that you've heard every year at Passover about the story of God's great deliverance
[3345.78 → 3348.80] he says do that now in remembrance of me
[3348.80 → 3355.08] and so on this night this Passover the Passover is subverted
[3355.08 → 3357.46] and it becomes Holy Communion
[3357.46 → 3360.36] it is the night before the cross
[3360.36 → 3364.42] and Jesus would die the next day as the lamb of the Passover
[3364.42 → 3366.02] that God provided
[3366.02 → 3368.74] and his blood would be shed
[3368.74 → 3371.94] so that his people could be delivered
[3371.94 → 3374.30] and that they could receive mercy
[3374.30 → 3378.12] that's why in verse 19 Jesus says
[3378.12 → 3380.90] this is my body
[3380.90 → 3382.86] which is given for you
[3382.86 → 3384.94] do this in remembrance of me
[3384.94 → 3387.36] and he says
[3387.36 → 3390.44] as he passes around this wine cup
[3390.44 → 3392.84] you know, and his words would have been shocking
[3392.84 → 3396.18] this cup that is poured out for you
[3396.18 → 3397.78] is the new covenant
[3397.78 → 3399.16] in my blood
[3399.16 → 3402.36] Jews cannot drink the blood
[3402.36 → 3404.92] even of the Passover lamb
[3404.92 → 3408.02] the blood is the life
[3408.02 → 3410.58] therefore it belongs to God
[3410.58 → 3413.56] but in this new Passover
[3413.56 → 3416.88] we are invited to drink the life of God
[3416.88 → 3421.18] it's the blood that brings us true freedom
[3421.18 → 3422.46] and true deliverance
[3422.46 → 3423.66] right
[3423.66 → 3424.60] Jesus died
[3424.60 → 3427.02] if you just imagine that lamb
[3427.02 → 3429.14] he died to save us
[3429.14 → 3433.12] he died so that we would not be destroyed
[3433.12 → 3437.26] and he died so that we could be put into a right relationship with God
[3437.26 → 3439.36] and we are to remember this
[3439.36 → 3440.68] as we partake of this meal
[3440.68 → 3442.42] so when
[3442.42 → 3443.74] so now when we say
[3443.74 → 3444.90] this is a meal that
[3444.90 → 3445.86] remembers
[3445.86 → 3447.08] right
[3447.08 → 3449.18] we remember Jesus' sacrifice
[3449.18 → 3450.60] on the cross
[3450.60 → 3452.94] some of us
[3452.94 → 3453.20] you know
[3453.20 → 3453.42] we
[3453.42 → 3454.18] me
[3454.18 → 3454.92] maybe you
[3454.92 → 3455.70] you think
[3455.70 → 3457.98] what exactly does that mean then to remember
[3457.98 → 3459.72] you know like
[3459.72 → 3461.34] so when we just took the supper
[3461.34 → 3462.72] and ideally we would have
[3462.72 → 3463.44] had the supper
[3463.44 → 3464.44] after this message
[3464.44 → 3468.08] but we needed to logistically have our Chinese family here
[3468.08 → 3469.86] so now we're doing it
[3469.86 → 3470.08] but
[3470.08 → 3470.88] but you know
[3470.88 → 3472.18] if you just remember doing it
[3472.18 → 3474.28] what does it mean
[3474.28 → 3475.02] when we
[3475.02 → 3476.02] remember
[3476.02 → 3477.44] as we partake of that meal
[3477.44 → 3478.88] sometimes we think
[3478.88 → 3479.68] well it better mean
[3479.68 → 3481.66] it means I need to keep my thoughts on Jesus
[3481.66 → 3483.98] and not let my mind wander
[3483.98 → 3485.38] maybe to think about
[3485.38 → 3487.24] what I need to buy at the grocery store later today
[3487.24 → 3490.58] or I better remember
[3490.58 → 3494.02] so that I'm not thinking about watching the Super Bowl later today
[3494.02 → 3496.80] or celebrating Chinese New Year
[3496.80 → 3499.76] or does it mean
[3499.76 → 3502.08] I need to remember Jesus' death
[3502.08 → 3502.72] so that
[3502.72 → 3502.96] you know
[3502.96 → 3504.40] I need to feel really sad
[3504.40 → 3507.02] or I need to feel really bad
[3507.02 → 3507.82] that he died
[3507.82 → 3508.62] right
[3508.62 → 3509.44] what do we do
[3509.44 → 3510.24] what are we remembering
[3510.24 → 3511.46] it can kind of seem ambiguous
[3511.46 → 3513.72] what does it mean to remember
[3513.72 → 3515.38] well there's a
[3515.38 → 3516.16] here's a quote
[3516.16 → 3518.28] from the English Puritan
[3518.28 → 3519.14] John Level
[3519.14 → 3521.52] that I found really helpful
[3521.52 → 3523.34] and he talks about
[3523.34 → 3524.76] how there are two ways
[3524.76 → 3525.90] of remembering
[3525.90 → 3527.36] he talks about
[3527.36 → 3528.16] the speculative
[3528.16 → 3530.12] and the affectionate
[3530.12 → 3531.18] and this is what he says
[3531.18 → 3534.50] a speculative remembrance
[3534.50 → 3535.98] is only to call to mind
[3535.98 → 3536.64] the history
[3536.64 → 3537.88] of such a person
[3537.88 → 3538.78] and his sufferings
[3538.78 → 3540.54] that Christ was once
[3540.54 → 3541.48] put to death
[3541.48 → 3542.12] in the flesh
[3542.12 → 3545.16] an affectionate remembrance
[3545.16 → 3547.22] is when we so call
[3547.22 → 3548.48] Christ and his death
[3548.48 → 3549.82] to our minds
[3549.82 → 3550.76] to feel
[3550.76 → 3551.58] the powerful
[3551.58 → 3553.58] impressions thereof
[3553.58 → 3555.96] upon our hearts
[3555.96 → 3559.76] so as followers of Jesus
[3559.76 → 3560.86] when we come to this
[3560.86 → 3561.62] Lord's Supper
[3561.62 → 3563.36] we remember
[3563.36 → 3564.38] how
[3564.38 → 3566.96] with an affectionate
[3566.96 → 3567.74] remembrance
[3567.74 → 3569.72] that the grace
[3569.72 → 3570.56] that was demonstrated
[3570.56 → 3571.20] on the cross
[3571.20 → 3571.88] is the grace
[3571.88 → 3572.70] that we need
[3572.70 → 3573.76] when we come to this table
[3573.76 → 3574.54] it's the grace
[3574.54 → 3575.12] that we need
[3575.12 → 3575.70] every day
[3575.70 → 3576.52] in our lives
[3576.52 → 3579.14] so this is the way
[3579.14 → 3579.68] of remembering
[3579.68 → 3580.94] and when we remember
[3580.94 → 3581.58] in this way
[3581.58 → 3582.64] it shapes us
[3582.64 → 3584.52] and reorients
[3584.52 → 3585.50] our hearts
[3585.50 → 3586.96] in light of
[3586.96 → 3587.78] that past event
[3587.78 → 3589.58] we become people
[3589.58 → 3591.02] who trust in Jesus
[3591.02 → 3592.58] and we take
[3592.58 → 3593.44] what he's accomplished
[3593.44 → 3594.86] and we receive it
[3594.86 → 3595.66] today
[3595.66 → 3597.82] so that's the first point
[3597.82 → 3598.54] the Lord's Supper
[3598.54 → 3599.14] is a meal
[3599.14 → 3600.12] that remembers
[3600.12 → 3601.26] it points back
[3601.26 → 3603.04] to not only the Passover
[3603.04 → 3603.84] but the fulfillment
[3603.84 → 3604.70] of the Passover
[3604.70 → 3605.48] with the death
[3605.48 → 3606.24] of Jesus
[3606.24 → 3606.96] the Lamb of God
[3606.96 → 3609.26] now let's look
[3609.26 → 3610.18] at the second point
[3610.18 → 3610.60] today
[3610.60 → 3611.32] the second point
[3611.32 → 3611.82] is this
[3611.82 → 3612.60] it's a meal
[3612.60 → 3613.60] that spiritually
[3613.60 → 3614.38] forms us
[3614.38 → 3616.96] so what this means
[3616.96 → 3618.00] is when we take
[3618.00 → 3618.64] the Lord's Supper
[3618.64 → 3619.68] it's not only
[3619.68 → 3620.32] about remembering
[3620.32 → 3621.16] the past
[3621.16 → 3622.66] God's divine actions
[3622.66 → 3623.30] in the past
[3623.30 → 3624.32] but actually
[3624.32 → 3625.46] again it changes us
[3625.46 → 3626.38] today in the present
[3626.38 → 3628.22] here's an analogy
[3628.22 → 3631.04] one of my favourite
[3631.04 → 3631.70] things to do
[3631.70 → 3632.54] in the winter
[3632.54 → 3633.92] is to go downhill skiing
[3633.92 → 3634.58] this year
[3634.58 → 3636.18] I have not yet been skiing
[3636.18 → 3637.36] it's been too warm
[3637.36 → 3637.84] it's terrible
[3637.84 → 3638.56] there's no snow
[3638.56 → 3640.86] such as you know
[3640.86 → 3642.16] well it's sad
[3642.16 → 3642.38] but
[3642.38 → 3644.28] anyway
[3644.28 → 3645.56] years ago
[3645.56 → 3646.26] when we moved here
[3646.26 → 3647.00] to British Columbia
[3647.00 → 3648.02] the first thing
[3648.02 → 3648.72] I wanted to do
[3648.72 → 3649.48] is taught my kids
[3649.48 → 3649.90] to ski
[3649.90 → 3650.60] and I'm sure
[3650.60 → 3651.14] I've talked about
[3651.14 → 3651.64] this before
[3651.64 → 3653.48] and I taught
[3653.48 → 3654.12] the kids to ski
[3654.12 → 3654.96] and it was so
[3654.96 → 3656.68] much work
[3656.68 → 3658.24] it was exhausting
[3658.24 → 3659.32] years and years
[3659.32 → 3659.96] of training
[3659.96 → 3661.90] but I taught them
[3661.90 → 3662.60] when they were
[3662.60 → 3663.26] really little
[3663.26 → 3664.90] I taught them
[3664.90 → 3665.62] how to make their
[3665.62 → 3666.54] skis into a pizza
[3666.54 → 3668.38] I taught them
[3668.38 → 3669.08] how to put their
[3669.08 → 3670.62] hand on their knees
[3670.62 → 3671.50] and to bend their knees
[3671.50 → 3672.12] I taught them
[3672.12 → 3673.58] how to turn their head
[3673.58 → 3674.74] that would help them
[3674.74 → 3675.86] make the turns
[3675.86 → 3677.96] then I would say
[3677.96 → 3679.30] this common refrain
[3679.30 → 3680.14] to them
[3680.14 → 3681.12] every time we go
[3681.12 → 3681.70] down the hill
[3681.70 → 3682.96] remember
[3682.96 → 3684.56] remember
[3684.56 → 3685.44] remember
[3685.44 → 3686.66] right
[3686.66 → 3687.18] remember
[3687.18 → 3688.60] hands on your knees
[3688.60 → 3689.70] remember
[3689.70 → 3690.66] keep your skis
[3690.66 → 3691.22] like a pizza
[3691.22 → 3692.06] remember
[3692.06 → 3692.88] look up
[3692.88 → 3693.54] follow me
[3693.54 → 3695.28] I'm saying this
[3695.28 → 3696.06] all the time
[3696.06 → 3697.14] and when I say
[3697.14 → 3697.64] to my children
[3697.64 → 3698.30] remember
[3698.30 → 3700.26] I'm not just saying
[3700.26 → 3701.54] call to mind
[3701.54 → 3702.28] that event
[3702.28 → 3703.24] last time
[3703.24 → 3704.08] I taught you
[3704.08 → 3705.40] in the past
[3705.40 → 3706.34] right
[3706.34 → 3707.18] what I'm saying is
[3707.18 → 3709.22] drag that event
[3709.22 → 3709.96] from the past
[3709.96 → 3710.46] what I already
[3710.46 → 3711.32] taught you
[3711.32 → 3712.04] in a ski lesson
[3712.04 → 3713.34] drag it into
[3713.34 → 3714.08] the present
[3714.08 → 3715.34] into the here
[3715.34 → 3715.70] and now
[3715.70 → 3716.22] and let that
[3716.22 → 3717.06] give shape
[3717.06 → 3718.76] to how you move
[3718.76 → 3719.36] down the hill
[3719.36 → 3720.56] on your skis
[3720.56 → 3723.18] so it's not just
[3723.18 → 3724.20] about the past
[3724.20 → 3725.04] it's about
[3725.04 → 3726.38] changing us
[3726.38 → 3727.92] in the present
[3727.92 → 3728.96] right
[3728.96 → 3729.62] does that make sense
[3729.62 → 3732.38] my point is
[3732.38 → 3733.32] I think that is
[3733.32 → 3734.76] what Jesus is getting at
[3734.76 → 3736.10] here at the table
[3736.10 → 3736.90] and he says
[3736.90 → 3738.04] do this
[3738.04 → 3739.70] in remembrance of me
[3739.70 → 3741.44] in other words
[3741.44 → 3742.42] let my sacrifice
[3742.42 → 3743.08] on the cross
[3743.08 → 3744.18] 2,000 years ago
[3744.18 → 3745.70] break into the present
[3745.70 → 3747.68] and shape the trajectory
[3747.68 → 3749.42] of your life
[3749.42 → 3750.46] now
[3750.46 → 3752.30] let it change your life
[3752.30 → 3753.30] let it shape you
[3753.30 → 3755.58] as you live
[3755.58 → 3756.54] in this world now
[3756.54 → 3758.38] you know
[3758.38 → 3759.02] and this happens
[3759.02 → 3759.94] in all kinds of ways
[3759.94 → 3760.48] and we could
[3760.48 → 3761.80] spend a lot of time
[3761.80 → 3762.28] unpacking
[3762.28 → 3763.32] all the different ways
[3763.32 → 3763.92] that the Lord's Supper
[3763.92 → 3764.64] shapes us
[3764.64 → 3765.92] but today
[3765.92 → 3767.34] I just want to share
[3767.34 → 3768.12] share two
[3768.12 → 3769.66] mention two ways
[3769.66 → 3770.82] that the Lord's Supper
[3770.82 → 3771.74] shapes us today
[3771.74 → 3773.00] the first one
[3773.00 → 3774.52] is that when
[3774.52 → 3775.06] you and I
[3775.06 → 3776.12] partake of the Lord's Supper
[3776.12 → 3777.28] and often we don't
[3777.28 → 3778.36] even think about this
[3778.36 → 3780.14] but when we eat
[3780.14 → 3780.70] that bread
[3780.70 → 3781.28] and we drink
[3781.28 → 3782.02] that cup
[3782.02 → 3783.58] you are saying
[3783.58 → 3785.76] I am not
[3785.76 → 3786.68] self-sustaining
[3786.68 → 3788.72] I am not
[3788.72 → 3789.50] self-sustaining
[3789.50 → 3790.20] on my own
[3790.20 → 3791.76] so notice what
[3791.76 → 3792.56] Jesus says here
[3792.56 → 3793.56] in verse 19
[3793.56 → 3796.42] he took bread
[3796.42 → 3797.48] and he gave thanks
[3797.48 → 3798.24] and what did he do
[3798.24 → 3800.14] he broke it
[3800.14 → 3801.26] and he gave it
[3801.26 → 3801.60] to them
[3801.60 → 3803.44] and so in the New Testament
[3803.44 → 3804.08] the Lord's Supper
[3804.08 → 3805.08] is sometimes called
[3805.08 → 3806.16] the breaking
[3806.16 → 3807.00] of bread
[3807.00 → 3809.06] for example
[3809.06 → 3810.26] in Acts chapter 2
[3810.26 → 3811.42] it says
[3811.42 → 3812.44] they devoted themselves
[3812.44 → 3813.68] to the apostles teaching
[3813.68 → 3814.60] and to the fellowship
[3814.60 → 3816.02] to the breaking
[3816.02 → 3816.92] of bread
[3816.92 → 3818.08] and to prayer
[3818.08 → 3818.74] and it refers
[3818.74 → 3819.52] to the Lord's Supper
[3819.52 → 3821.76] now remember
[3821.76 → 3823.70] this was a long time ago
[3823.70 → 3824.36] now if you have
[3824.36 → 3825.38] a loaf of bread today
[3825.38 → 3826.54] what do you
[3826.54 → 3827.00] how are you going
[3827.00 → 3827.62] to consume it
[3827.62 → 3828.86] you don't just take
[3828.86 → 3829.46] the huge loaf
[3829.46 → 3830.28] and you know
[3830.28 → 3831.72] you cut it right
[3831.72 → 3832.62] you cut it into slices
[3832.62 → 3833.88] and so what do we have
[3833.88 → 3835.58] we have bread knives
[3835.58 → 3836.54] it's a great invention
[3836.54 → 3837.20] and they have
[3837.20 → 3838.30] this serrated blade
[3838.30 → 3838.58] right
[3838.58 → 3839.22] so we can make
[3839.22 → 3840.22] a nice clean cut
[3840.22 → 3841.56] well
[3841.56 → 3842.72] this
[3842.72 → 3844.50] was before
[3844.50 → 3845.74] the serrated edge
[3845.74 → 3847.38] and so when you
[3847.38 → 3848.10] wanted to share
[3848.10 → 3848.70] a loaf of bread
[3848.70 → 3849.64] what did you have to do
[3849.64 → 3851.56] you had to break it
[3851.56 → 3853.26] so you tore off
[3853.26 → 3853.64] a piece
[3853.64 → 3854.90] with your bare hands
[3854.90 → 3855.74] and then you
[3855.74 → 3856.56] passed the loaf
[3856.56 → 3857.76] around the table
[3857.76 → 3858.62] to the next person
[3858.62 → 3860.44] and in the same way
[3860.44 → 3862.30] Jesus was broken
[3862.30 → 3864.10] he was torn apart
[3864.10 → 3864.92] at the cross
[3864.92 → 3866.38] and he was handed
[3866.38 → 3867.24] to you and me
[3867.24 → 3868.06] at the table
[3868.06 → 3870.22] for us to receive
[3870.22 → 3871.26] the gift
[3871.26 → 3872.12] of life
[3872.12 → 3874.38] and so in the
[3874.38 → 3875.54] breaking of bread
[3875.54 → 3877.40] please listen
[3877.40 → 3877.90] if you can
[3877.90 → 3878.62] in the breaking
[3878.62 → 3879.16] of bread
[3879.16 → 3879.88] we remember
[3879.88 → 3881.22] that all
[3881.22 → 3882.10] of life
[3882.10 → 3883.10] comes
[3883.10 → 3883.70] through
[3883.70 → 3884.34] death
[3884.34 → 3887.34] all life
[3887.34 → 3887.88] comes through
[3887.88 → 3888.18] death
[3888.18 → 3889.46] what I mean is
[3889.46 → 3890.50] you are alive
[3890.50 → 3891.22] right now
[3891.22 → 3892.36] you are breathing
[3892.36 → 3893.40] in
[3893.40 → 3894.82] and breathing out
[3894.82 → 3896.20] because something
[3896.20 → 3896.90] died for you
[3896.90 → 3898.62] whether an animal
[3898.62 → 3900.12] or a plant
[3900.12 → 3901.60] and without
[3901.60 → 3902.62] that death
[3902.62 → 3903.64] you would not
[3903.64 → 3904.10] be alive
[3904.10 → 3906.60] so every time
[3906.60 → 3907.22] we eat
[3907.22 → 3907.94] a meal
[3907.94 → 3908.74] a snack
[3908.74 → 3910.68] it is a daily
[3910.68 → 3911.38] reminder
[3911.38 → 3912.38] of sacrifice
[3912.38 → 3913.40] and of our
[3913.40 → 3913.96] dependence
[3913.96 → 3914.64] on the life
[3914.64 → 3915.08] of another
[3915.08 → 3917.10] every single day
[3917.10 → 3917.34] right
[3917.34 → 3917.74] if we eat
[3917.74 → 3918.66] one or two
[3918.66 → 3919.36] or three times
[3919.36 → 3919.72] a day
[3919.72 → 3920.68] we literally
[3920.68 → 3921.86] need the death
[3921.86 → 3922.68] of something else
[3922.68 → 3923.52] so that we can live
[3923.52 → 3925.46] and in the breaking
[3925.46 → 3925.98] of bread
[3925.98 → 3926.98] at the Lord's table
[3926.98 → 3927.70] we remember
[3927.70 → 3928.74] that all of our
[3928.74 → 3929.10] life
[3929.10 → 3930.12] comes from
[3930.12 → 3931.08] Jesus' death
[3931.08 → 3931.72] on the cross
[3931.72 → 3932.82] that we are
[3932.82 → 3933.48] dependent
[3933.48 → 3935.94] on his death
[3935.94 → 3937.48] for our life
[3937.48 → 3939.22] and so when we
[3939.22 → 3939.84] eat the bread
[3939.84 → 3940.32] and we drink
[3940.32 → 3940.88] the cup
[3940.88 → 3941.84] you are saying
[3941.84 → 3942.78] I am completely
[3942.78 → 3943.78] dependent
[3943.78 → 3945.36] on Jesus
[3945.36 → 3946.72] he is the bread
[3946.72 → 3947.18] of life
[3947.18 → 3947.72] for me
[3947.72 → 3948.80] he is the cup
[3948.80 → 3949.20] for me
[3949.20 → 3950.34] without his death
[3950.34 → 3951.16] I would not
[3951.16 → 3951.78] be alive
[3951.78 → 3954.74] here's a quote
[3954.74 → 3955.84] as one writer
[3955.84 → 3956.50] Tim Chester
[3956.50 → 3957.14] has said
[3957.14 → 3959.56] each mouthful
[3959.56 → 3960.96] is a reminder
[3960.96 → 3961.80] that we cannot
[3961.80 → 3962.78] save ourselves
[3962.78 → 3965.50] right
[3965.50 → 3966.30] when we eat
[3966.30 → 3967.16] at the Lord's table
[3967.16 → 3968.00] each mouthful
[3968.00 → 3968.72] is a reminder
[3968.72 → 3969.74] that we
[3969.74 → 3970.88] cannot save
[3970.88 → 3971.32] ourselves
[3971.32 → 3972.32] we are dependent
[3972.32 → 3972.86] on him
[3972.86 → 3974.84] so that's the
[3974.84 → 3975.20] first thing
[3975.20 → 3975.58] now there's
[3975.58 → 3976.06] another
[3976.06 → 3976.90] just one more
[3976.90 → 3977.92] way the Lord's
[3977.92 → 3979.02] table shapes us
[3979.02 → 3979.58] here and now
[3979.58 → 3980.12] and we see it
[3980.12 → 3981.12] again in verse 19
[3981.12 → 3982.84] where he says
[3982.84 → 3983.76] he took bread
[3983.76 → 3984.90] and he gave
[3984.90 → 3985.40] thanks
[3985.40 → 3986.56] he broke it
[3986.56 → 3986.88] and he gave
[3986.88 → 3987.28] it to them
[3987.28 → 3989.18] so this Greek
[3989.18 → 3990.00] word for
[3990.00 → 3990.86] the verb
[3990.86 → 3991.52] give thanks
[3991.52 → 3992.80] is Eucharist
[3992.80 → 3994.04] meaning to give
[3994.04 → 3994.72] thanks and it
[3994.72 → 3995.24] is a word from
[3995.24 → 3995.84] which now we
[3995.84 → 3996.42] get the term
[3996.42 → 3997.32] Eucharist
[3997.32 → 3998.22] which sounds
[3998.22 → 3998.94] kind of fancy
[3998.94 → 3999.68] and sacramental
[3999.68 → 4000.44] now in English
[4000.44 → 4001.62] but originally
[4001.62 → 4002.34] it just means
[4002.34 → 4003.40] to give thanks
[4003.40 → 4004.76] so it's a
[4004.76 → 4005.88] Thanksgiving meal
[4005.88 → 4006.48] that's what it is
[4006.48 → 4007.22] it's Thanksgiving
[4007.22 → 4008.76] and so the
[4008.76 → 4009.30] Lord's supper
[4009.30 → 4011.06] not only became
[4011.06 → 4012.04] known as the
[4012.04 → 4012.78] breaking of bread
[4012.78 → 4014.00] it also became
[4014.00 → 4014.62] known as
[4014.62 → 4015.46] the Thanksgiving
[4015.46 → 4017.26] and in the
[4017.26 → 4017.80] Eucharist
[4017.80 → 4018.16] or the
[4018.16 → 4018.92] Thanksgiving meal
[4018.92 → 4020.10] we remember
[4020.10 → 4021.26] how much
[4021.26 → 4021.96] we have
[4021.96 → 4022.56] to be
[4022.56 → 4023.50] thankful for
[4023.50 → 4025.54] that all
[4025.54 → 4026.34] that we enjoy
[4026.34 → 4027.44] in our life
[4027.44 → 4028.10] with God
[4028.10 → 4029.32] and from
[4029.32 → 4029.78] God
[4029.78 → 4031.02] it's all
[4031.02 → 4031.58] a gift
[4031.58 → 4033.16] nothing
[4033.16 → 4033.78] is earned
[4033.78 → 4034.14] nothing
[4034.14 → 4034.80] is deserved
[4034.80 → 4035.28] everything
[4035.28 → 4036.14] is by grace
[4036.14 → 4037.06] it is all
[4037.06 → 4037.46] from the
[4037.46 → 4038.00] sheer mercy
[4038.00 → 4038.48] of God
[4038.48 → 4040.18] and
[4040.18 → 4041.14] entitlement
[4041.14 → 4041.72] if we feel
[4041.72 → 4042.34] like we do
[4042.34 → 4043.08] deserve it
[4043.08 → 4043.80] it is a
[4043.80 → 4044.44] sure fire
[4044.44 → 4044.98] recipe
[4044.98 → 4045.76] to misery
[4045.76 → 4046.78] and discontentment
[4046.78 → 4048.78] whereas gratitude
[4048.78 → 4049.68] is the pathway
[4049.68 → 4050.32] to life
[4050.32 → 4052.12] and so when we
[4052.12 → 4052.74] partake of the
[4052.74 → 4053.14] Lord's supper
[4053.14 → 4053.44] friends
[4053.44 → 4054.10] we are reminded
[4054.10 → 4054.68] that God's
[4054.68 → 4054.98] grace
[4054.98 → 4055.32] and his
[4055.32 → 4055.64] mercy
[4055.64 → 4056.60] is a gift
[4056.60 → 4057.02] we give
[4057.02 → 4057.50] thanks
[4057.50 → 4058.88] that God
[4058.88 → 4059.22] has given
[4059.22 → 4059.52] it to
[4059.52 → 4059.86] us
[4059.86 → 4060.82] and when
[4060.82 → 4061.48] we remember
[4061.48 → 4062.28] that as we
[4062.28 → 4064.00] eat of the
[4064.00 → 4064.50] supper and we
[4064.50 → 4065.22] take it into
[4065.22 → 4065.82] our hearts
[4065.82 → 4066.62] it forms us
[4066.62 → 4067.42] as what
[4067.42 → 4068.86] as a people
[4068.86 → 4069.44] of gratitude
[4069.44 → 4071.72] right
[4071.72 → 4072.52] we are shaped
[4072.52 → 4073.08] as a people
[4073.08 → 4073.66] of gratitude
[4073.66 → 4075.14] and a people
[4075.14 → 4075.74] of joy
[4075.74 → 4076.92] and of humility
[4076.92 → 4078.70] as month
[4078.70 → 4079.38] by month
[4079.38 → 4080.50] year by year
[4080.50 → 4081.90] we take the
[4081.90 → 4082.42] Lord's supper
[4082.42 → 4083.76] we become people
[4083.76 → 4084.24] of gratitude
[4084.24 → 4084.40] gratitude
[4084.40 → 4087.06] so that's the
[4087.06 → 4087.58] second point
[4087.58 → 4088.62] here in
[4088.62 → 4089.42] looking at
[4089.42 → 4090.06] this passage
[4090.06 → 4090.58] right
[4090.58 → 4091.34] first the
[4091.34 → 4091.72] Lord's supper
[4091.72 → 4092.08] is a meal
[4092.08 → 4092.64] that remembers
[4092.64 → 4093.94] it's a meal
[4093.94 → 4094.46] that spiritually
[4094.46 → 4095.30] forms us
[4095.30 → 4096.08] and then thirdly
[4096.08 → 4096.48] lastly
[4096.48 → 4097.72] it's a meal
[4097.72 → 4098.82] that anticipates
[4098.82 → 4099.24] it's a meal
[4099.24 → 4099.98] that anticipates
[4099.98 → 4102.00] so here's a
[4102.00 → 4102.38] couple of
[4102.38 → 4103.00] verses that we
[4103.00 → 4103.46] read in our
[4103.46 → 4104.28] passage again
[4104.28 → 4105.52] for us to
[4105.52 → 4105.96] look at
[4105.96 → 4107.66] verse 16
[4107.66 → 4109.34] Jesus says
[4109.34 → 4110.00] for I tell
[4110.00 → 4110.60] you I will
[4110.60 → 4111.38] not eat it
[4111.38 → 4111.86] again
[4111.86 → 4113.46] until it
[4113.46 → 4114.62] finds fulfillment
[4114.62 → 4115.34] in the kingdom
[4115.34 → 4115.88] of God
[4115.88 → 4117.38] he says it
[4117.38 → 4117.76] again in
[4117.76 → 4118.28] verse 18
[4118.28 → 4119.02] for I tell
[4119.02 → 4119.54] you I will
[4119.54 → 4120.16] not drink
[4120.16 → 4121.22] again from
[4121.22 → 4121.58] the fruit
[4121.58 → 4122.10] of the vine
[4122.10 → 4123.60] until the
[4123.60 → 4124.12] kingdom of
[4124.12 → 4125.52] God comes
[4125.52 → 4127.78] Jesus is
[4127.78 → 4128.40] saying here
[4128.40 → 4130.20] I am not
[4130.20 → 4130.46] going to
[4130.46 → 4131.04] celebrate this
[4131.04 → 4131.82] Passover meal
[4131.82 → 4132.66] with you again
[4132.66 → 4133.36] right he's
[4133.36 → 4133.84] about to die
[4133.84 → 4134.44] on the cross
[4134.44 → 4135.68] he says not
[4135.68 → 4137.60] until it's
[4137.60 → 4138.58] fulfilled in
[4138.58 → 4139.16] the future
[4139.16 → 4141.50] and he's
[4141.50 → 4142.80] referring to
[4142.80 → 4143.46] the marriage
[4143.46 → 4144.20] supper of
[4144.20 → 4144.56] the lamb
[4144.56 → 4145.40] the messianic
[4145.40 → 4145.74] banquet
[4145.74 → 4146.84] when people
[4146.84 → 4147.42] from every
[4147.42 → 4148.26] tribe tongue
[4148.26 → 4149.06] and nation
[4149.06 → 4149.54] will sit
[4149.54 → 4150.28] together at
[4150.28 → 4150.74] the table
[4150.74 → 4151.48] of Jesus
[4151.48 → 4153.22] at the
[4153.22 → 4154.32] with Jesus
[4154.32 → 4155.38] at the head
[4155.38 → 4155.80] of it all
[4155.80 → 4157.08] right and
[4157.08 → 4157.44] friends that
[4157.44 → 4157.98] is the future
[4157.98 → 4158.78] that is certain
[4158.78 → 4159.58] the fullness
[4159.58 → 4160.28] of the kingdom
[4160.28 → 4160.94] Jesus says
[4160.94 → 4161.54] it will come
[4161.54 → 4164.32] Paul later
[4164.32 → 4165.16] writes that
[4165.16 → 4165.80] when you eat
[4165.80 → 4166.24] and drink
[4166.24 → 4166.70] the Lord's
[4166.70 → 4166.92] supper
[4166.92 → 4167.50] what do you
[4167.50 → 4168.48] do you
[4168.48 → 4169.58] proclaim the
[4169.58 → 4170.28] Lord's death
[4170.28 → 4172.26] until he
[4172.26 → 4172.78] comes
[4172.78 → 4174.56] and so
[4174.56 → 4174.84] with the
[4174.84 → 4175.14] Lord's
[4175.14 → 4175.38] supper
[4175.38 → 4176.76] there is
[4176.76 → 4177.50] a yearning
[4177.50 → 4179.02] and an
[4179.02 → 4179.70] expectancy
[4179.70 → 4180.82] of what
[4180.82 → 4181.12] is to
[4181.12 → 4181.40] come
[4181.40 → 4182.56] and this
[4182.56 → 4183.22] reminds us
[4183.22 → 4183.50] that the
[4183.50 → 4183.84] Lord's
[4183.84 → 4184.06] supper
[4184.06 → 4185.38] is an
[4185.38 → 4186.04] appetizer
[4186.04 → 4186.92] right
[4186.92 → 4187.26] is an
[4187.26 → 4187.96] appetizer
[4187.96 → 4188.58] that whets

[4204.84 → 4205.56] is rural
[4205.56 → 4206.04] Virginia

[4270.98 → 4271.48] sacrament
[4271.48 → 4272.56] it's not

[4959.22 → 4961.56] But just to share the sad news
[4961.56 → 4962.48] That Sonia Kulun
[4962.48 → 4965.70] Passed away on Wednesday early morning

[4968.76 → 4971.92] And she died with family
[4971.92 → 4973.42] And she died with family around her
[4973.42 → 4974.28] And at peace

[4980.42 → 4988.02] Lord we can only begin to consider
[4988.02 → 4989.26] Your goodness to us
[4989.26 → 4992.04] We're thankful
[4992.04 → 4995.40] Lord that you've made us in your image
[4995.40 → 4999.22] That you've created us for fellowship with you
[4999.22 → 5003.60] We're thankful for sending your Son
[5003.60 → 5004.82] To redeem our lives
[5004.82 → 5007.66] And to restore that broken relationship
[5007.66 → 5009.60] That was marred by our sin
[5009.60 → 5012.70] We thank you for giving us purpose
[5012.70 → 5014.44] And hope in our daily lives
[5014.44 → 5017.14] For the good work that you have appointed
[5017.14 → 5018.98] For each one of us to walk in
[5018.98 → 5022.90] We thank you for our future hope
[5022.90 → 5025.98] That one day all things will be made right
[5025.98 → 5029.64] And there will be no more sadness, tears, mourning, or death
[5029.64 → 5032.56] When you, Lord Jesus, come again
[5032.56 → 5035.76] Lord you are the holy God
[5035.76 → 5038.76] Sovereign and yet kind
[5038.76 → 5042.02] You are our provider in every season
[5042.02 → 5045.30] So we come before you as your people
[5045.30 → 5047.54] Acknowledging you in all our ways
[5047.54 → 5050.38] Holy Spirit
[5050.38 → 5052.28] Teach us to trust the Father
[5052.28 → 5053.50] With all of our hearts
[5053.50 → 5057.28] Help us to lean not on our own understanding
[5057.28 → 5060.08] But the trust in the wisdom of the Son
[5060.08 → 5062.86] And let us know
[5062.86 → 5066.96] That he makes our paths straight
[5066.96 → 5070.32] That he is the way, the truth, and the life
[5070.32 → 5072.02] And to know that
[5072.02 → 5074.40] Especially when we feel discouraged
[5074.40 → 5076.26] Or disheartened
[5076.26 → 5077.30] Or distraught
[5077.30 → 5079.74] By the circumstances of our lives
[5079.74 → 5080.86] And the world around us
[5080.86 → 5083.76] Lord we pray especially this morning
[5083.76 → 5084.88] For the Colin family
[5084.88 → 5087.14] We thank you for Sonia
[5087.14 → 5090.94] And the gift of her life among us
[5090.94 → 5093.78] This church family for many, many years
[5093.78 → 5095.90] Lord you created her
[5095.90 → 5097.64] You redeemed her
[5097.64 → 5100.00] Through the life, death, and resurrection of your Son
[5100.00 → 5102.54] We thank you that she is now
[5102.54 → 5106.06] Even now beholding your face in glory
[5106.06 → 5109.88] Yet Lord we grieve to have to say goodbye
[5109.88 → 5113.02] To the people that we love
[5113.02 → 5115.90] And so we pray that you would comfort Jerry
[5115.90 → 5118.42] Her son Jason
[5118.42 → 5119.54] And Kevin
[5119.54 → 5121.38] And the rest of the Colin family
[5121.38 → 5122.58] And the extended family
[5122.58 → 5125.50] You know our sorrow
[5125.50 → 5126.26] Oh Lord
[5126.26 → 5128.70] So we pray that the Holy Spirit
[5128.70 → 5129.38] The comforter
[5129.38 → 5130.92] That you promised
[5130.92 → 5132.58] Would bring comfort to this family
[5132.58 → 5134.52] With your loving presence
[5134.52 → 5136.86] This morning Lord
[5136.86 → 5138.08] We also lift to those
[5138.08 → 5139.06] In our church family
[5139.06 → 5141.12] Who look to you for healing

[5144.78 → 5147.76] Who had throat surgery this past week
[5147.76 → 5149.00] We pray Lord
[5149.00 → 5150.22] That you would heal her throat
[5150.22 → 5151.18] And restore her
[5151.18 → 5153.00] So that she can once again
[5153.00 → 5153.80] Breathe comfortably
[5153.80 → 5156.48] And God
[5156.48 → 5158.04] We have
[5158.04 → 5160.16] Probably
[5160.16 → 5161.24] Met many people
[5161.24 → 5163.48] On our hearts
[5163.48 → 5165.38] Who need healing in some way
[5165.38 → 5167.02] So Lord we take a moment right now
[5167.02 → 5169.52] And we ask that you would bring to mind
[5169.52 → 5171.76] Someone who is in pain in some way
[5171.76 → 5174.22] And we lift
[5174.22 → 5175.84] Those people before you now
[5175.84 → 5189.40] Lord we pray for the world
[5189.40 → 5190.00] That you made
[5190.00 → 5192.00] The world that you love
[5192.00 → 5193.20] And that you are redeeming
[5193.20 → 5194.96] We pray Lord
[5194.96 → 5196.38] For the church around the world
[5196.38 → 5199.06] We pray for faithful gospel witness
[5199.06 → 5201.70] And faithful gospel action
[5201.70 → 5205.42] That brings knowledge of you
[5205.42 → 5206.92] And healing to the world
[5206.92 → 5209.04] Lord we pray for workers
[5209.04 → 5210.66] To be sent out into your harvest
[5210.66 → 5213.30] We also think Lord
[5213.30 → 5213.88] Of the world
[5213.88 → 5214.68] And all the conflicts
[5214.68 → 5215.34] That are happening
[5215.34 → 5216.34] We think of Ukraine
[5216.34 → 5216.86] And Russia
[5216.86 → 5217.96] And the world there still
[5217.96 → 5219.64] We think of Gaza
[5219.64 → 5221.12] And the terrible loss of life
[5221.12 → 5223.70] We think of the refugee crisis
[5223.70 → 5225.86] In so many places in the world
[5225.86 → 5227.96] Lord in your mercy
[5227.96 → 5229.66] Would you in all of these situations
[5229.66 → 5232.04] And in many that we haven't named
[5232.04 → 5233.62] Would you Lord work
[5233.62 → 5234.78] Through governments
[5234.78 → 5235.50] Through leaders
[5235.50 → 5236.82] Through organizations
[5236.82 → 5237.86] Through
[5237.86 → 5239.30] Every
[5239.30 → 5239.94] The people
[5239.94 → 5242.56] Wherever these conflicts exist
[5242.56 → 5242.96] Lord
[5242.96 → 5244.62] To bring wise resolution
[5244.62 → 5247.58] To bring healing in life
[5247.58 → 5248.62] According to your will
[5248.62 → 5250.48] And Lord we now
[5250.48 → 5251.88] As your people
[5251.88 → 5253.24] Gather our prayers together
[5253.24 → 5254.42] In one voice
[5254.42 → 5256.16] As we say the prayer
[5256.16 → 5256.76] That Jesus
[5256.76 → 5258.30] Taught us to pray
[5258.30 → 5259.04] Saying together
[5259.04 → 5260.50] Our Father
[5260.50 → 5261.58] Who art in heaven
[5261.58 → 5263.56] Hallowed be thy name
[5263.56 → 5265.20] Thy kingdom come
[5265.20 → 5266.58] Thy will be done
[5266.58 → 5268.60] On earth as it is in heaven
[5268.60 → 5270.66] Give us this day
[5270.66 → 5271.62] Our daily bread
[5271.62 → 5273.06] And forgive us
[5273.06 → 5274.10] Our trespasses
[5274.10 → 5275.84] As we forgive those
[5275.84 → 5277.44] Who trespass against us
[5277.44 → 5278.78] And lead us not
[5278.78 → 5279.64] Into temptation
[5279.64 → 5281.08] But deliver us
[5281.08 → 5281.70] From evil
[5281.70 → 5283.52] For thine is the kingdom
[5283.52 → 5284.56] And the power
[5284.56 → 5285.58] And the glory
[5285.58 → 5287.24] Forever and ever

[5310.42 → 5311.90] His body was broken
[5311.90 → 5312.94] His blood was shed
[5312.94 → 5314.04] For you and for me
[5314.04 → 5315.82] And may that
[5315.82 → 5316.72] Astound us today
[5316.72 → 5318.68] I invite you to
