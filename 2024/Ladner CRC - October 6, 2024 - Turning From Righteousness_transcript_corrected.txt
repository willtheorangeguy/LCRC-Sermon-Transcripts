[0.00 → 3.36] um
[22.00 → 23.36] do
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[242.00 → 244.00] Amen.
[244.00 → 246.00] Amen.
[246.00 → 248.00] Amen.
[248.00 → 250.00] Amen.
[250.00 → 252.00] Good morning.
[252.00 → 258.00] Good morning and welcome here.
[258.00 → 266.00] Especially anyone who's visiting and those who are joining us on livestream as well.
[266.00 → 280.00] But for each one who is here, we're glad you're here and if you are a guest and visiting with us, especially we hope that you will feel at home among us and that all of us especially will feel at home in God's presence here this morning.
[280.00 → 285.00] Because he has promised that wherever two or three are gathered, he is here.
[285.00 → 291.00] And although we ask him to be here, we just know he's here because he's promised that.
[291.00 → 303.00] After the service is a great time for all of us to catch up in the fellowship hall for some refreshments and just getting to know each other a little bit better and checking in on one another.
[303.00 → 305.00] It's a good time to do that.
[305.00 → 307.00] There are just a few announcements.
[307.00 → 318.00] First, please take note that the soup and bun that was planned for next week has been postponed to November 10th, which will be our following Family Sunday.
[318.00 → 320.00] So, not next week.
[320.00 → 325.00] If you're coming to be fed next week, it will be spiritually but not physically.
[325.00 → 326.00] Okay?
[326.00 → 332.00] And another thing about next week's service, there have been no volunteers to do nursery.
[332.00 → 338.00] So, unless that happens this week, do not plan on nursery being available next week.
[338.00 → 353.00] So, now I invite you to follow on the screen for our words of invitation.
[353.00 → 357.00] In your wisdom, O God, you call us here to worship you.
[357.00 → 362.00] We gather alive to the word of God.
[362.00 → 372.00] You call us to be fully alive with your life abundant, ready to listen and respond with heart, soul, strength, and mind.
[372.00 → 377.00] We listen alive to the word of God.
[377.00 → 390.00] You call us to be always watchful for your word of wisdom, sometimes startling and unexpected, sometimes still and quiet, but always dwelling among us.
[390.00 → 393.00] We watch and wait for the word of God.
[393.00 → 394.00] Amen.
[394.00 → 397.00] Would you please rise for God's greeting?
[397.00 → 404.00] The greeting comes to us from Galatians 1, verses 3 to 5.
[404.00 → 420.00] Grace to us and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever.
[420.00 → 423.00] And everyone said, Amen.
[423.00 → 428.00] As God has greeted us, let's take a moment to warmly greet one another.
[428.00 → 458.00] Who, Good morning, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[458.00 → 487.98] Holy, Holy, Holy,
[488.00 → 493.84] Lord God Almighty,
[495.14 → 500.06] early in the morning
[500.06 → 506.00] our song shall rise to Thee.
[507.14 → 512.26] Holy, Holy, Holy,
[512.26 → 518.92] merciful and mighty,
[520.30 → 526.00] God in three Persons,
[526.74 → 530.24] blessed Trinity.
[530.24 → 537.48] Holy, Holy, Holy,
[537.48 → 543.24] all the saints adore Thee,
[544.30 → 549.22] passing down their golden crowns
[549.22 → 553.88] around the glassy sea.
[555.30 → 560.22] Cherubim and Seraphim
[560.22 → 565.22] falling down before Thee.
[565.22 → 571.22] O worded, O dead,
[571.22 → 576.12] and evermore shall be.
[577.44 → 581.96] Holy, Holy, Holy,
[581.96 → 587.22] though the darkness whining,
[587.22 → 592.98] though the armies that flow down
[592.98 → 597.22] Thy glory may not see.
[597.22 → 603.76] Only Thou art holy,
[603.76 → 609.22] there is none beside Thee.
[609.22 → 614.46] Perfect in power,
[614.46 → 618.94] love and purity.
[618.94 → 619.94] Amen.
[623.22 → 625.30] You are worthy, O Lord,
[625.64 → 626.78] to receive glory,
[627.18 → 628.48] honour, and praise.
[629.14 → 631.56] For You created all things,
[632.36 → 633.90] uphold all things,
[634.48 → 636.02] and redeem all things.
[636.68 → 638.68] You alone are the true God.
[639.66 → 642.00] Accept our adoration and worship,
[642.72 → 645.26] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[645.60 → 645.86] Amen.
[645.86 → 658.12] A thousand generations
[658.12 → 661.34] falling down in worship
[661.34 → 664.50] to sing this all new pages
[664.50 → 666.44] to the Lamb.
[668.44 → 671.04] And all who've run before us,
[671.58 → 674.02] and all who will believe,
[674.02 → 678.34] will sing this all ages to the Lamb.
[680.40 → 683.32] Your name is the highest,
[683.32 → 686.16] Your name is the greatest,
[686.16 → 691.28] Your name stands above them all.
[692.16 → 695.40] All thrones and dominions,
[695.56 → 698.10] all powers and positions,
[698.10 → 702.48] Your name stands above them all.
[702.48 → 705.48] And the angels' blood.
[705.48 → 711.48] Holy, O Christian Christ.
[711.48 → 716.48] Holy, You are eternal.
[716.48 → 723.48] Holy, Holy forever.
[723.48 → 728.86] Holy, You are eternal.
[728.86 → 730.86] If You've been forgiven,
[730.86 → 734.18] If You've been redeemed,
[734.18 → 738.66] Sing this song forever to the Lamb.
[738.66 → 740.86] If You've been forgiven,
[740.86 → 742.86] If You've been forgiven,

[746.12 → 749.86] Sing this song forever to the Lamb.
[749.86 → 756.24] We sing this song forever to the Lamb.
[756.24 → 759.16] And the angels' blood.
[759.16 → 765.08] Holy, O creation Christ.
[765.08 → 771.24] Holy, You are lifted high.
[771.24 → 778.62] Holy, Holy forever.

[788.54 → 794.54] Holy, You are always free.
[794.54 → 800.96] Holy, Holy forever.

[839.34 → 853.32] All tongues and the mountains, all vows and the positions, Your name stands above them all and the angels write
[853.32 → 872.02] Holy of creation Christ, Holy you are lifted high, Holy only forever.
[872.02 → 894.90] Hear people sing, Holy to the King of kings, Holy you will always be, Holy, Holy forever.
[894.90 → 905.02] And will always be, Holy, Holy forever.
[908.02 → 909.24] Please be seated.
[909.24 → 921.24] Amen.
[921.24 → 930.18] Our Old Testament scripture reading this morning comes from the book of Hosea, one that we don't
[930.18 → 942.82] open all that often, probably, Hosea 11 verses 1 to 11, where God laments over the sins of
[942.82 → 943.16] Israel.
[945.30 → 951.36] When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
[952.22 → 955.90] But the more they were called, the more they went away from me.
[955.90 → 960.52] They sacrificed to the bales, and they burnt incense to images.
[961.62 → 966.12] It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms.
[966.68 → 969.54] But they did not realize it was I who healed them.
[970.76 → 975.70] I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love.
[976.82 → 982.48] To them, I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them.
[982.48 → 989.24] Will they not return to Egypt, and will not Assyria rule over them, because they refuse
[989.24 → 990.02] to repent?
[991.28 → 993.50] A sword will flash in their cities.
[993.98 → 997.86] It will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans.
[998.78 → 1000.86] My people are determined to turn from me.
[1001.38 → 1005.86] Even though they call me God Most High, I will by no means exalt them.
[1005.86 → 1009.36] How can I give you up, Ephraim?
[1010.06 → 1012.04] How can I hand you over, Israel?
[1012.88 → 1014.76] How can I treat you like Adam?
[1015.54 → 1017.64] How can I make you like Nebiim?
[1018.36 → 1020.60] My heart is changed within me.
[1021.36 → 1023.62] All my compassion is aroused.
[1023.62 → 1030.10] I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again.
[1030.78 → 1035.42] For I am God, and not a man, the Holy One among you.
[1036.28 → 1038.20] I will not come against their cities.
[1039.28 → 1040.58] They will follow the Lord.
[1041.08 → 1042.60] He will roar like a lion.
[1043.42 → 1047.36] When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.
[1047.36 → 1054.84] They will come from Egypt, trembling like sparrows, from Assyria, fluttering like doves.
[1055.76 → 1059.26] I will settle them in their homes, declares the Lord.
[1061.80 → 1069.44] And of course, this passage ties in very well for what we do every Sunday, which is our time
[1069.44 → 1071.48] of confession of our sins to the Lord.
[1072.92 → 1077.08] All throughout Scripture, we read about God's passion for his people.
[1077.36 → 1086.06] He just wants to love them, and he wants them to love him and obey him, as he intended
[1086.06 → 1088.14] from the very beginning of time.
[1089.16 → 1091.12] But Israel was stubborn.
[1092.30 → 1095.74] They sinned and refused to acknowledge their wrongdoing.
[1097.96 → 1101.52] Jesus wept over Jerusalem with deep love and compassion.
[1102.32 → 1106.62] You can hear it from his words from Luke 13, verse 34.
[1107.36 → 1108.36] Jerusalem, Jerusalem.
[1108.36 → 1109.36] Jerusalem, Jerusalem.
[1110.06 → 1112.78] You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you.
[1113.14 → 1119.02] How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her
[1119.02 → 1119.36] wings.
[1119.94 → 1121.20] But you were not willing.
[1122.84 → 1123.92] Please pray with me.
[1123.92 → 1133.48] Lord, our creator and lover, we too resist you.
[1134.52 → 1139.80] It's so easy to shuffle around in the shadows instead of turning towards and walking confidently
[1139.80 → 1140.98] in your light.
[1141.98 → 1146.16] The light exposes our deeds, but also overcomes our darkness.
[1146.16 → 1154.48] Thank you, Jesus, that when we confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us and
[1154.48 → 1155.28] make us clean.
[1156.24 → 1161.62] We take a moment now in humility to confess our sins silently before you.
[1161.62 → 1162.62] Thank you.
[1162.62 → 1163.62] Thank you.
[1163.62 → 1164.62] Thank you.
[1164.62 → 1186.46] Thank you for your mercy and grace towards us, made possible by the death of Christ on the cross.
[1186.84 → 1187.12] Amen.
[1187.12 → 1196.02] I'm going to ask you to rise and read our verse of assurance together with me, and then
[1196.02 → 1200.22] we'll sing a few more songs of assurance and praise.
[1200.22 → 1205.58] This is from Romans 8, verses 1 and 2.
[1205.68 → 1206.54] Let's read it together.
[1207.84 → 1213.66] So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.
[1214.38 → 1221.36] And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from
[1221.36 → 1224.56] the power of sin that leads to death.
[1225.24 → 1226.32] And we'll sing about that.
[1230.22 → 1246.38] Jesus, then I get free from the love of sin that leads to death.
[1246.38 → 1262.92] Jesus said, if I could, I should come to Him.
[1262.92 → 1272.86] No one else can satisfy, I should come to Him.
[1272.86 → 1283.86] Jesus said, if I am weak, I should come to Him.
[1283.86 → 1293.86] No one else can be my strength, I should come to Him.
[1293.86 → 1304.86] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1305.64 → 1314.86] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus so in God.
[1314.86 → 1315.86] Amen.
[1315.86 → 1321.86] Jesus said, if I could, I should come to Him.
[1321.86 → 1333.86] Jesus said, if I could, I should come to Him.
[1333.86 → 1343.86] No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[1343.86 → 1354.86] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1354.86 → 1365.86] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus so in God.
[1365.86 → 1366.86] Amen.
[1366.86 → 1367.86] Amen.
[1367.86 → 1368.86] Amen.
[1368.86 → 1369.86] Amen.
[1369.86 → 1370.86] Amen.
[1370.86 → 1371.86] Amen.
[1371.86 → 1372.86] Amen.
[1372.86 → 1373.86] Amen.
[1373.86 → 1374.86] Amen.
[1374.86 → 1375.86] Amen.
[1375.86 → 1380.86] Jesus said, if I am lost, He will come to me.
[1380.86 → 1385.86] When He showed me on His cross, He will come to me.
[1385.86 → 1395.86] When He showed me on His cross, He will come to me.
[1395.86 → 1405.86] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1405.86 → 1415.86] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus so in God.
[1415.86 → 1426.86] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1426.86 → 1437.86] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus so in God.
[1437.86 → 1443.86] Jesus so in God.
[1443.86 → 1457.82] There were people-
[1458.86 → 1463.86] Oh God, before the mountains of fall
[1463.86 → 1468.86] Where days of sweet and summer filled they used
[1468.86 → 1477.10] From the everlasting new world
[1477.10 → 1486.14] With love and love, there's stars and nations long
[1486.14 → 1491.84] With thousands of nothing in your soul
[1491.84 → 1499.84] From the everlasting new world
[1499.84 → 1506.92] And all our days are held within your hand
[1506.92 → 1511.98] Your perfect love and favour of your name
[1511.98 → 1518.06] We rise within the wisdom of your plan
[1518.06 → 1523.70] Everlasting God
[1523.70 → 1532.32] With the tragic of love
[1532.32 → 1537.06] And lost mountains, life is but inside
[1537.06 → 1546.06] From everlasting new world
[1546.06 → 1555.64] And all our days are held within your hand
[1555.64 → 1560.92] Your perfect love and favour of your name
[1560.92 → 1566.70] We rise within the wisdom of your plan
[1566.70 → 1571.54] Everlasting God
[1571.54 → 1585.98] O God of mine, our ways are held to you
[1585.98 → 1592.06] But by your grace you're making all things new
[1592.06 → 1597.42] So sad and sad as in our golden days
[1597.42 → 1602.64] As snow and sherry and flu, but we make
[1602.64 → 1609.22] From everlasting new world
[1609.22 → 1617.94] And all our days are held within your hands
[1617.94 → 1621.58] Your perfect love and favour of your name
[1621.58 → 1627.52] We rise within the wisdom of your plan
[1627.52 → 1632.52] Everlasting God
[1632.52 → 1633.52] Everlasting God
[1633.52 → 1634.52] We rise within the wisdom of your plan
[1634.52 → 1635.52] Everlasting God
[1635.52 → 1637.52] Everlasting God
[1637.52 → 1647.52] You may be seated
[1647.52 → 1661.52] You may be seated
[1661.52 → 1687.28] That was a very lovely song
[1687.28 → 1689.14] That we just sang
[1689.14 → 1689.92] I love that
[1689.92 → 1692.54] It was very low though
[1692.54 → 1696.86] All right
[1696.86 → 1698.28] So good morning everyone
[1698.28 → 1702.00] It's nice to see you all this morning
[1702.00 → 1706.24] We are in the midst of a sermon series
[1706.24 → 1708.70] In the letter to the Romans
[1708.70 → 1710.36] In the New Testament
[1710.36 → 1713.88] So I invite you now to open your Bibles
[1713.88 → 1716.72] To Romans chapter 1
[1716.72 → 1717.84] This is our fifth week
[1717.84 → 1720.70] Looking at Romans chapter 1
[1720.70 → 1721.80] And we'll finish it today
[1721.80 → 1730.98] That is on page 837
[1730.98 → 1733.18] In your Brown Pew Bible
[1733.18 → 1739.24] Okay so page 837
[1739.24 → 1741.66] We'll read Romans chapter 1
[1741.66 → 1745.20] We'll begin in verse 24
[1745.20 → 1746.86] Just for a bit of context
[1746.86 → 1749.72] And we will read to the end of the chapter
[1749.72 → 1752.64] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word
[1752.64 → 1756.40] Therefore God gave them over
[1756.40 → 1758.70] In the sinful desires of their hearts
[1758.70 → 1761.30] To sexual impurity
[1761.30 → 1764.44] For the degrading of their bodies with one another
[1764.44 → 1767.52] They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
[1767.52 → 1770.12] And worshipped and served created things
[1770.12 → 1771.32] Rather than the creator
[1771.32 → 1773.36] Who is forever praised
[1773.36 → 1773.90] Amen
[1773.90 → 1775.74] Because of this
[1775.74 → 1778.30] God gave them over to shameful lusts
[1779.04 → 1781.54] Even their women exchanged natural relations
[1781.54 → 1782.94] For unnatural ones
[1782.94 → 1784.36] In the same way
[1784.36 → 1787.34] The men also abandoned natural relations with women
[1787.34 → 1790.54] And were inflamed with lusts for one another
[1790.54 → 1794.26] Men committed indecent acts with other men
[1794.26 → 1797.62] And received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion
[1797.62 → 1798.90] Furthermore
[1798.90 → 1801.14] Since they did not think it worthwhile
[1801.14 → 1802.76] To retain the knowledge of God
[1802.76 → 1805.70] He gave them over to a depraved mind
[1805.70 → 1807.44] To do what ought not to be done
[1807.44 → 1810.88] They have become filled with every kind of wickedness
[1810.88 → 1813.42] Evil, greed, and depravity
[1813.42 → 1818.00] They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice
[1818.00 → 1821.24] They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters
[1821.24 → 1823.20] Insolent, arrogant, and boastful
[1823.20 → 1825.54] They invent ways of doing evil
[1825.54 → 1827.56] They disobey their parents
[1827.56 → 1830.56] They are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless
[1830.56 → 1833.48] Although they know God's righteous decree
[1833.48 → 1835.76] That those who do such things deserve death
[1835.76 → 1839.04] They not only continue to do these very things
[1839.04 → 1842.70] But also approve of those who practice them
[1842.70 → 1845.24] This is the word of the Lord
[1845.24 → 1848.52] Let's pray
[1848.52 → 1852.22] And let's ask for God's blessing upon His word
[1852.22 → 1853.06] Let's pray together
[1853.06 → 1856.58] Our Heavenly Father
[1856.58 → 1858.74] We thank you for your word
[1858.74 → 1860.84] Which is absolutely true
[1860.84 → 1863.28] And that you give to us
[1863.28 → 1864.88] Because you love us
[1864.88 → 1867.50] We ask Holy Spirit
[1867.50 → 1868.78] By your mercy
[1868.78 → 1869.78] To teach us
[1869.78 → 1872.32] We ask that you would guide us
[1872.32 → 1874.24] That you would convict us
[1874.24 → 1876.40] And that you would comfort us
[1876.40 → 1879.64] So that we might put our hope
[1879.64 → 1883.14] In our merciful Saviour, Jesus Christ
[1883.14 → 1885.56] We pray in His name and for His sake
[1885.56 → 1886.46] Amen
[1886.46 → 1891.04] Well, I told you the passage ahead of time
[1891.04 → 1892.02] And you're still here
[1892.02 → 1893.98] So thank you for coming today
[1893.98 → 1896.92] And if you didn't get the email
[1896.92 → 1899.08] No, it's too late
[1899.08 → 1901.62] So, you know, I don't know anybody
[1901.62 → 1902.70] Who would choose
[1902.70 → 1905.14] To preach from this passage
[1905.14 → 1906.30] If they could
[1906.30 → 1909.60] And that is actually one of the many reasons
[1909.60 → 1913.76] Why it's good to preach through books of the Bible
[1913.76 → 1918.22] To protect you from faint-hearted preachers
[1918.22 → 1921.52] But this passage is also
[1921.52 → 1924.26] Not for the faint-hearted listener
[1924.26 → 1925.10] Right?
[1925.16 → 1926.68] This is a shall we say
[1926.68 → 1928.80] Rather difficult passage
[1928.80 → 1930.80] To hear and to read
[1930.80 → 1933.60] Not because it's hard to understand
[1933.60 → 1936.50] But because it is so clear
[1936.50 → 1939.30] In the way that it leaves all of us
[1939.30 → 1940.90] Without excuse
[1940.90 → 1941.82] Right?
[1941.96 → 1943.70] And so as we look at this passage
[1943.70 → 1946.28] All of us can find ways
[1946.28 → 1948.60] That we fall into the errors
[1948.60 → 1951.04] And the sins that are described here
[1951.04 → 1952.92] And that is Paul's point
[1952.92 → 1956.10] But it's also a difficult passage
[1956.10 → 1959.02] Because as Paul begins to list
[1959.02 → 1960.14] These many sins
[1960.14 → 1963.16] That God has given humanity over to
[1963.16 → 1964.50] In judgment
[1964.50 → 1967.80] In verses 26 and 27
[1967.80 → 1970.28] He takes up the particular sin
[1970.28 → 1972.34] Of homosexual practice
[1972.34 → 1975.48] And as I say that
[1975.48 → 1976.74] For many of us
[1976.74 → 1979.08] Our hearts just fall
[1979.08 → 1981.08] Into our stomachs
[1981.08 → 1982.82] And so
[1982.82 → 1983.78] Yes
[1983.78 → 1985.78] We are going to talk about
[1985.78 → 1987.24] Homosexuality this morning
[1987.24 → 1989.20] And we're going to do that
[1989.20 → 1990.58] As an act of obedience
[1990.58 → 1991.74] To God's word
[1991.74 → 1994.10] And also as an act of love
[1994.10 → 1994.70] To our neighbours
[1994.70 → 1995.80] And to one another
[1995.80 → 1997.70] Because there are many of us
[1997.70 → 1999.22] Who are struggling with this
[1999.22 → 2000.88] In one way or another
[2000.88 → 2001.82] Right?
[2001.88 → 2003.02] Some of us are wrestling
[2003.02 → 2004.68] With same-sex attraction
[2004.68 → 2006.42] Here this morning
[2006.42 → 2007.96] And you're wondering
[2007.96 → 2010.26] As we read a passage like this
[2010.26 → 2010.96] We wonder
[2010.96 → 2013.06] Does God love you?
[2015.02 → 2016.88] Are you welcome in this church?
[2016.96 → 2018.56] And I wanted to say categorically
[2018.56 → 2019.80] The answer is yes
[2019.80 → 2020.88] God loves you
[2020.88 → 2022.80] You are welcome here
[2022.80 → 2025.70] Others of us
[2025.70 → 2027.28] Are wrestling with
[2027.28 → 2029.10] What we should think about this
[2029.10 → 2031.80] Especially because of the cultural moment
[2031.80 → 2032.62] In which we live
[2032.62 → 2034.30] And we need to know
[2034.30 → 2035.32] What the Bible teaches
[2035.32 → 2037.02] And we also need to understand
[2037.02 → 2038.50] Our cultural moment
[2038.50 → 2039.78] Is not that different
[2039.78 → 2040.96] From Paul's
[2040.96 → 2043.04] In the pagan Roman Empire
[2043.04 → 2046.08] And, so I am inviting us
[2046.08 → 2046.70] This morning
[2046.70 → 2047.94] To practice
[2047.94 → 2049.06] The art
[2049.06 → 2050.18] Of charitable
[2050.18 → 2051.04] Listening
[2051.04 → 2053.38] The art of charitable listening
[2053.38 → 2055.38] I don't understand
[2055.38 → 2056.14] Everything going on
[2056.14 → 2056.72] In this passage
[2056.72 → 2058.80] I cannot say
[2058.80 → 2059.94] Or we don't have time
[2059.94 → 2060.36] To unpack
[2060.36 → 2061.48] Everything going on
[2061.48 → 2062.54] In this topic
[2062.54 → 2064.52] But I believe
[2064.52 → 2065.46] That God does speak
[2065.46 → 2066.44] To us through his word
[2066.44 → 2067.86] And I believe
[2067.86 → 2068.76] That God loves us
[2068.76 → 2069.82] And he cares for us
[2069.82 → 2071.60] And so
[2071.60 → 2073.16] That's the invitation
[2073.16 → 2074.18] From our end
[2074.18 → 2075.06] Charitable listening
[2075.06 → 2077.60] And the
[2077.60 → 2078.54] You know
[2078.54 → 2079.02] The obligation
[2079.02 → 2079.78] On my end
[2079.78 → 2081.06] Is to
[2081.06 → 2082.36] Constrain myself
[2082.36 → 2083.42] To what the Bible teaches
[2083.42 → 2084.30] And try to help us
[2084.30 → 2085.12] Understand it together
[2085.12 → 2087.48] So what I want to do
[2087.48 → 2088.00] This morning
[2088.00 → 2089.24] Is as we look
[2089.24 → 2089.86] At this passage
[2089.86 → 2091.06] My hope is that
[2091.06 → 2092.02] We will be able
[2092.02 → 2092.76] To clear up
[2092.76 → 2093.94] Some of the misconceptions
[2093.94 → 2096.78] About what Paul is
[2096.78 → 2098.38] And isn't saying here
[2098.38 → 2100.10] And then
[2100.10 → 2101.02] We will talk about
[2101.02 → 2102.24] The application
[2102.24 → 2103.02] Okay
[2103.02 → 2104.14] So I don't have points
[2104.14 → 2105.62] But I want to just talk about
[2105.62 → 2106.44] What's Paul saying
[2106.44 → 2108.20] And then let's talk about
[2108.20 → 2109.30] A couple of points of application
[2109.30 → 2111.96] And so in order to understand
[2111.96 → 2113.18] What Paul is saying here
[2113.18 → 2115.08] We need to remember
[2115.08 → 2116.54] The story of the Bible
[2116.54 → 2117.86] Okay
[2117.86 → 2118.14] Because
[2118.14 → 2120.20] This whole text
[2120.20 → 2120.86] That we read
[2120.86 → 2121.74] Is set
[2121.74 → 2123.54] Within the backdrop
[2123.54 → 2124.64] Of Genesis
[2124.64 → 2125.78] Chapters 1 to 3
[2125.78 → 2126.88] The first three chapters
[2126.88 → 2127.40] Of the Bible
[2127.40 → 2128.74] And you can see that
[2128.74 → 2130.18] Because of some of the language
[2130.18 → 2131.10] That he uses
[2131.10 → 2131.82] In our passage
[2131.82 → 2133.04] And in the larger context
[2133.04 → 2134.26] He uses language
[2134.26 → 2135.26] Like creation
[2135.26 → 2136.32] Creator
[2136.32 → 2137.32] Image
[2137.32 → 2138.18] Likeness
[2138.18 → 2139.18] Birds
[2139.18 → 2139.70] Animals
[2139.70 → 2140.38] Reptiles
[2140.38 → 2140.84] Okay
[2140.84 → 2142.14] He's using these words
[2142.14 → 2142.90] That we find
[2142.90 → 2144.04] In Genesis chapter 1
[2144.04 → 2146.12] So now when we look
[2146.12 → 2147.26] At Genesis chapter 1
[2147.26 → 2149.10] We see that God
[2149.10 → 2150.64] Makes the world
[2150.64 → 2152.16] By speaking
[2152.16 → 2154.10] I want us to pause
[2154.10 → 2155.08] And reflect on that
[2155.08 → 2156.60] Paul makes
[2156.60 → 2157.22] Not Paul
[2157.22 → 2158.00] God
[2158.00 → 2159.20] Makes the world
[2159.20 → 2160.08] By speaking
[2160.08 → 2161.58] As God
[2161.58 → 2163.12] Speaks his word
[2163.12 → 2164.42] This creation
[2164.42 → 2165.58] That we live in
[2165.58 → 2166.34] Literally
[2166.34 → 2168.10] Comes into being
[2168.10 → 2169.38] Which means
[2169.38 → 2170.20] That you and I
[2170.20 → 2171.24] We were made
[2171.24 → 2172.74] We've been created
[2172.74 → 2174.66] By God's word
[2174.66 → 2176.82] And it means that
[2176.82 → 2178.44] God is our creator
[2178.44 → 2180.18] And we are created
[2180.18 → 2180.92] By him
[2180.92 → 2181.96] We are creatures
[2181.96 → 2183.38] Of his creation
[2183.38 → 2184.64] We are part of creation
[2184.64 → 2186.28] And it means that
[2186.28 → 2187.14] God's word then
[2187.14 → 2188.06] Is the reality
[2188.06 → 2188.88] Of our lives
[2188.88 → 2190.12] Right
[2190.12 → 2190.34] He
[2190.34 → 2191.76] His creating word
[2191.76 → 2192.72] He created us
[2192.72 → 2194.42] He sustains our lives
[2194.42 → 2195.76] He gives definition
[2195.76 → 2196.84] To our lives
[2196.84 → 2198.70] And who we are
[2198.70 → 2200.92] As his people
[2200.92 → 2203.54] In God's word
[2203.54 → 2204.58] Through which
[2204.58 → 2205.36] He makes the world
[2205.36 → 2206.68] Made creation
[2206.68 → 2208.98] According to his design
[2208.98 → 2210.44] In a certain way
[2210.44 → 2212.28] We see that God
[2212.28 → 2214.20] In his creative brilliance
[2214.20 → 2215.38] In his creative beauty
[2215.38 → 2217.58] He creates a whole series
[2217.58 → 2219.94] Of complementary pairs
[2219.94 → 2221.26] In creation
[2221.26 → 2221.62] Right
[2221.62 → 2222.06] We see
[2222.06 → 2223.50] He creates heaven
[2223.50 → 2224.44] And earth
[2224.44 → 2226.82] He creates land
[2226.82 → 2227.56] And sea
[2227.56 → 2228.60] Night
[2228.60 → 2229.36] And day
[2229.36 → 2231.04] And the most
[2231.04 → 2232.38] Beautiful occurrences
[2232.38 → 2233.02] Are when
[2233.02 → 2234.28] Those two opposites
[2234.28 → 2235.34] Of those pairs
[2235.34 → 2236.28] Become one
[2236.28 → 2237.14] Right
[2237.14 → 2237.86] Consider with me
[2237.86 → 2238.36] For a moment
[2238.36 → 2239.44] You know
[2239.44 → 2240.46] When night
[2240.46 → 2242.62] Turns into day
[2242.62 → 2243.86] And we see
[2243.86 → 2244.82] The sunrise
[2244.82 → 2246.16] Or when day
[2246.16 → 2247.42] Fades into night
[2247.42 → 2248.36] And we see
[2248.36 → 2248.98] The sunset
[2248.98 → 2249.88] Those are
[2249.88 → 2251.34] So beautiful
[2251.34 → 2251.80] Right
[2251.80 → 2252.48] As the sky
[2252.48 → 2252.98] Is painted
[2252.98 → 2253.52] With all these
[2253.52 → 2254.38] Glorious colours
[2254.38 → 2256.48] And when land
[2256.48 → 2257.36] Meets sea
[2257.36 → 2258.04] We call that
[2258.04 → 2258.90] The coastline
[2258.90 → 2260.40] And that's where
[2260.40 → 2261.62] Everybody wants to live
[2261.62 → 2262.68] Why does everyone
[2262.68 → 2263.78] Want to live on the coast?
[2264.12 → 2265.62] Because it's so beautiful
[2265.62 → 2266.88] Land and sea
[2266.88 → 2267.54] These opposites
[2267.54 → 2268.30] Coming together
[2268.30 → 2269.10] And it's
[2269.10 → 2270.04] The most expensive
[2270.04 → 2270.62] Real estate
[2270.62 → 2272.20] Right
[2272.20 → 2274.34] Throughout scripture
[2274.34 → 2276.00] Sacred moments
[2276.00 → 2277.38] Happen on mountaintops
[2277.38 → 2278.94] Because it's seen
[2278.94 → 2279.54] As heaven
[2279.54 → 2280.34] And earth
[2280.34 → 2281.22] Coming together
[2281.22 → 2283.78] And so when we get
[2283.78 → 2284.90] To the very pinnacle
[2284.90 → 2286.76] Of God's creation
[2286.76 → 2289.00] He makes humanity
[2289.00 → 2291.98] As a complementary pair
[2291.98 → 2292.82] Of male
[2292.82 → 2293.74] And female
[2293.74 → 2295.14] And when male
[2295.14 → 2295.74] And female
[2295.74 → 2296.82] Come together
[2296.82 → 2297.92] As one flesh
[2297.92 → 2299.72] That is the beauty
[2299.72 → 2300.68] The glory
[2300.68 → 2301.76] Of marriage
[2301.76 → 2303.40] That is the way
[2303.40 → 2305.04] God created the world
[2305.04 → 2305.56] That's the way
[2305.56 → 2306.66] He designed it to be
[2306.66 → 2308.04] And it's not surprising
[2308.04 → 2309.22] Then that in marriage
[2309.22 → 2310.62] It results in purpose
[2310.62 → 2311.64] Mission in the world
[2311.64 → 2312.96] It results in pleasure
[2312.96 → 2314.20] It results in
[2314.20 → 2315.32] Procreation
[2315.32 → 2318.58] Then right in
[2318.58 → 2319.56] The second chapter
[2319.56 → 2320.08] Of the Bible
[2320.08 → 2322.10] We are given a marriage
[2322.10 → 2323.12] Right in the beginning
[2323.12 → 2323.62] Of the Bible
[2323.62 → 2325.00] It's a marriage
[2325.00 → 2326.02] That is an earthly
[2326.02 → 2326.86] Picture
[2326.86 → 2328.48] Of God's
[2328.48 → 2329.94] Devoted
[2329.94 → 2331.76] Complementary
[2331.76 → 2333.02] Covenantal love
[2333.02 → 2334.38] For his people
[2334.38 → 2336.14] And the story
[2336.14 → 2336.72] Of the Bible
[2336.72 → 2338.36] Can be told
[2338.36 → 2339.38] Through this lens
[2339.38 → 2340.86] Of Jesus
[2340.86 → 2342.86] As our bridegroom
[2342.86 → 2344.64] Coming to take us
[2344.64 → 2345.90] As his bride
[2345.90 → 2347.22] The bride of Christ
[2347.22 → 2349.44] That he is devoted to
[2349.44 → 2350.48] In covenantal love
[2350.48 → 2352.28] And you know
[2352.28 → 2353.18] In this whole story
[2353.18 → 2353.78] Of the Bible
[2353.78 → 2354.70] It ends
[2354.70 → 2356.64] With a wedding
[2356.64 → 2358.28] It begins with a wedding
[2358.28 → 2359.60] It ends with a wedding
[2359.60 → 2361.12] And just like in
[2361.12 → 2362.02] Genesis 1 and 2
[2362.02 → 2362.92] There is creation
[2362.92 → 2364.18] Of heaven and earth
[2364.18 → 2365.72] And there's a wedding
[2365.72 → 2367.04] So we see in
[2367.04 → 2368.04] Revelations chapter
[2368.04 → 2369.08] 21 and 22
[2369.08 → 2370.32] The new heavens
[2370.32 → 2371.14] And the new earth
[2371.14 → 2372.58] United together
[2372.58 → 2373.74] A wedding banquet
[2373.74 → 2375.28] Where Christ
[2375.28 → 2376.56] And his church
[2376.56 → 2377.60] Are finally
[2377.60 → 2379.22] The wedding
[2379.22 → 2380.04] Is consummated
[2380.04 → 2380.76] We are together
[2380.76 → 2382.52] And we feast with him
[2382.52 → 2384.80] So
[2384.80 → 2387.20] For those who are
[2387.20 → 2388.10] In this life
[2388.10 → 2388.94] Given this gift
[2388.94 → 2389.56] Of marriage
[2389.56 → 2390.96] This side of eternity
[2390.96 → 2393.18] Our complementary
[2393.18 → 2394.54] Gendered lives
[2394.54 → 2395.54] Our complementary
[2395.54 → 2396.28] Marriages
[2396.28 → 2397.70] Are full of meaning
[2397.70 → 2398.62] And significance
[2398.62 → 2400.54] It's a sign
[2400.54 → 2401.60] Pointing
[2401.60 → 2403.30] To this big story
[2403.30 → 2403.94] Of the Bible
[2403.94 → 2405.30] Of God's love
[2405.30 → 2406.34] For his people
[2406.34 → 2408.94] And in Genesis
[2408.94 → 2410.98] This created order
[2410.98 → 2413.12] Is blessed by God
[2413.12 → 2414.26] It's blessed
[2414.26 → 2415.74] God speaks over it
[2415.74 → 2416.12] And he says
[2416.12 → 2417.06] This is very good
[2417.06 → 2418.94] And there's a sense
[2418.94 → 2420.02] Of affirmation
[2420.02 → 2421.46] And a sense
[2421.46 → 2422.12] Of blessing
[2422.12 → 2423.46] That we receive
[2423.46 → 2423.92] From God
[2423.92 → 2426.98] Now as we know
[2426.98 → 2428.62] That's not how
[2428.62 → 2429.32] The story
[2429.32 → 2431.54] Continues
[2431.54 → 2431.82] Right
[2431.82 → 2433.24] Because in Genesis 3
[2433.24 → 2433.86] We see that
[2433.86 → 2434.86] The word of God
[2434.86 → 2436.04] This word that created us
[2436.04 → 2436.92] That sustains us
[2436.92 → 2437.86] And blesses
[2437.86 → 2439.14] Is doubted
[2439.14 → 2439.94] Right
[2439.94 → 2440.90] Adam and Eve
[2440.90 → 2442.38] Doubt God's word
[2442.38 → 2442.76] To them
[2442.76 → 2445.22] And what that does
[2445.22 → 2446.80] Is our relationship
[2446.80 → 2447.86] With God's word
[2447.86 → 2449.04] Is now affected
[2449.04 → 2450.68] We are separated
[2450.68 → 2451.40] From God
[2451.40 → 2452.26] We no longer
[2452.26 → 2453.50] Listen to his voice
[2453.50 → 2456.08] In this background
[2456.08 → 2458.22] The story of the Bible
[2458.22 → 2459.02] Is where Paul
[2459.02 → 2460.10] Picks up
[2460.10 → 2461.56] In Romans 1
[2461.56 → 2462.84] Okay so let's have a look
[2462.84 → 2463.76] At verse 25
[2463.76 → 2466.38] Paul says
[2466.38 → 2468.30] They exchanged
[2468.30 → 2469.08] The truth
[2469.08 → 2470.06] About God
[2470.06 → 2471.30] For a lie
[2471.30 → 2472.90] And worshipped
[2472.90 → 2473.52] And served
[2473.52 → 2474.62] Created things
[2474.62 → 2476.16] Rather than the creator
[2476.16 → 2477.62] Who is forever praised
[2477.62 → 2477.98] Amen
[2477.98 → 2481.08] What's he saying?
[2482.14 → 2482.54] He's saying
[2482.54 → 2483.88] One of the first effects
[2483.88 → 2485.00] Of us
[2485.00 → 2486.10] No longer listening
[2486.10 → 2487.02] To God's word
[2487.02 → 2489.14] Is that we exchange
[2489.14 → 2490.58] This is a key word
[2490.58 → 2491.06] In this passage
[2491.06 → 2491.86] We exchange
[2491.86 → 2493.54] The truth about God
[2493.54 → 2494.78] What God says
[2494.78 → 2496.70] With a lie
[2496.70 → 2499.42] We no longer trust
[2499.42 → 2500.64] What God has revealed
[2500.64 → 2501.78] To us about his world
[2501.78 → 2502.92] How he has made us
[2502.92 → 2503.92] To live in his world
[2503.92 → 2506.22] And we relate wrongly
[2506.22 → 2507.12] To God
[2507.12 → 2508.14] And to his truth
[2508.14 → 2510.40] Because we exchange
[2510.40 → 2511.14] The truth of God
[2511.14 → 2511.58] For a lie
[2511.58 → 2512.50] We doubted his word
[2512.50 → 2513.56] We don't listen to God
[2513.56 → 2515.42] And verse 18
[2515.42 → 2516.50] Further up in our passage
[2516.50 → 2517.48] We saw last week
[2517.48 → 2519.24] Says we suppress the truth
[2519.24 → 2520.86] Okay
[2520.86 → 2521.68] This is all because
[2521.68 → 2523.92] Of this doubting of God
[2523.92 → 2524.42] That happened
[2524.42 → 2525.16] In the very beginning
[2525.16 → 2525.86] Of our story
[2525.86 → 2527.84] And then the second effect
[2527.84 → 2529.32] Is that since we
[2529.32 → 2530.62] No longer glory
[2530.62 → 2531.96] Glorify God
[2531.96 → 2533.20] We no longer worship God
[2533.20 → 2534.90] We turn
[2534.90 → 2536.76] To idolatry
[2536.76 → 2538.30] That's the second thing
[2538.30 → 2540.26] We worship and serve
[2540.26 → 2542.62] Created things
[2542.62 → 2544.52] Rather than the creator
[2544.52 → 2546.08] Let's
[2546.08 → 2547.46] Really think about
[2547.46 → 2548.42] What Paul is saying there
[2548.42 → 2551.14] Sin
[2551.14 → 2552.50] That has come into the world
[2552.50 → 2553.48] Like big S
[2553.48 → 2554.30] Capital sin
[2554.30 → 2554.88] Not just like
[2554.88 → 2555.10] You know
[2555.10 → 2555.70] We sin
[2555.70 → 2556.42] There's little sins
[2556.42 → 2557.00] That we commit
[2557.00 → 2557.92] But sin
[2557.92 → 2558.64] As a whole
[2558.64 → 2560.06] It came into the world
[2560.06 → 2561.42] Through Adam and Eve
[2561.42 → 2562.44] Refusing to worship
[2562.44 → 2563.14] And love God
[2563.14 → 2565.02] Refusing to give thanks
[2565.02 → 2565.52] To God
[2565.52 → 2567.76] And because we refuse
[2567.76 → 2569.00] To love and serve God
[2569.00 → 2570.36] Our creator
[2570.36 → 2571.86] Who is different from us
[2571.86 → 2572.92] We instead begin
[2572.92 → 2573.98] To love and serve
[2573.98 → 2575.18] Created things
[2575.18 → 2576.44] Which are like us
[2576.44 → 2577.98] Which are similar
[2577.98 → 2578.70] To us
[2578.70 → 2581.14] And because of that
[2581.14 → 2582.92] We are under the wrath
[2582.92 → 2583.86] And judgment of God
[2583.86 → 2585.52] God made us for himself
[2585.52 → 2586.90] He set his love upon us
[2586.90 → 2588.02] As we heard from Hosea
[2588.02 → 2590.42] But we spurned his love
[2590.42 → 2592.12] And we preferred
[2592.12 → 2594.76] The sameness of creation
[2594.76 → 2597.16] To the otherness of God
[2597.16 → 2600.42] And then what that judgment
[2600.42 → 2602.16] Looks like
[2602.16 → 2603.72] Is God
[2603.72 → 2606.06] Giving us over
[2606.06 → 2607.20] To our sin
[2607.20 → 2607.76] It's him
[2607.76 → 2609.56] Withholding his intervention
[2609.56 → 2611.06] Allowing our sin
[2611.06 → 2612.28] To run its course
[2612.28 → 2613.90] Our refusal to listen
[2613.90 → 2615.36] Our love
[2615.36 → 2617.00] Of the created world
[2617.00 → 2618.08] And idolatry
[2618.08 → 2619.74] And he lets us do it
[2619.74 → 2623.28] And the particular sin
[2623.28 → 2626.16] Where this is most clearly seen
[2626.16 → 2628.60] Is the sin
[2628.60 → 2630.74] Of same-sex behaviour
[2630.74 → 2634.70] Let's look at verses 26 and 27
[2634.70 → 2636.14] And we'll try to understand
[2636.14 → 2636.92] What this means
[2636.92 → 2640.22] Because of this
[2640.22 → 2640.38] Right
[2640.38 → 2641.36] Because of God's judgment
[2641.36 → 2643.40] God gave them over
[2643.40 → 2645.08] To shameful lusts
[2645.08 → 2645.90] Even their women
[2645.90 → 2647.58] Exchanged natural sexual relations
[2647.58 → 2648.70] For unnatural ones
[2648.70 → 2649.70] In the same way
[2649.70 → 2650.46] Men also
[2650.46 → 2652.12] Abandoned natural relationships
[2652.12 → 2652.80] With women
[2652.80 → 2654.26] And were aflame with lusts
[2654.26 → 2655.22] For one another
[2655.22 → 2659.52] Notice that Paul uses
[2659.52 → 2660.18] These words
[2660.18 → 2661.96] Natural and unnatural
[2661.96 → 2663.12] Several times
[2663.12 → 2665.80] Following Jewish custom
[2665.80 → 2667.20] He is referring to
[2667.20 → 2668.48] The natural order
[2668.48 → 2669.60] In creation
[2669.60 → 2670.62] God's design
[2670.62 → 2672.16] As God has made it
[2672.16 → 2673.78] And so what he says
[2673.78 → 2674.44] Very clearly
[2674.44 → 2675.66] Is that
[2675.66 → 2676.54] Natural
[2676.54 → 2677.80] Created way
[2677.80 → 2678.80] That God made
[2678.80 → 2679.72] For sexual relations
[2679.72 → 2680.80] In his world
[2680.80 → 2681.56] Are
[2681.56 → 2684.08] That complementary pair
[2684.08 → 2685.50] Of male and female
[2685.50 → 2687.32] And then the sin
[2687.32 → 2688.66] Of homosexual practice
[2688.66 → 2690.46] Is exchanging
[2690.46 → 2692.16] What God has designed
[2692.16 → 2693.04] For them
[2693.04 → 2694.80] In his wisdom
[2694.80 → 2695.56] In his goodness
[2695.56 → 2696.56] In his love
[2696.56 → 2698.28] For things that are
[2698.28 → 2700.48] Contrary to his design
[2700.48 → 2701.72] Contrary to nature
[2701.72 → 2704.74] And Paul doesn't leave
[2704.74 → 2705.80] Any ambiguity
[2705.80 → 2707.88] About what this means
[2707.88 → 2708.64] Right
[2708.64 → 2709.60] And this is important
[2709.60 → 2710.02] To note
[2710.02 → 2710.90] He's not leaving it
[2710.90 → 2711.26] Ambiguous
[2711.26 → 2712.26] He says
[2712.26 → 2713.78] Men also
[2713.78 → 2716.78] Abandoned natural relations
[2716.78 → 2717.72] With women
[2717.72 → 2719.82] So natural relations
[2719.82 → 2720.40] For a man
[2720.40 → 2721.96] Is to be with a woman
[2721.96 → 2723.38] There's no doubt
[2723.38 → 2725.50] It's explicitly stated
[2725.50 → 2728.00] Now listen
[2728.00 → 2728.98] Paul is not
[2728.98 → 2730.12] Highlighting
[2730.12 → 2731.30] Homosexual practice
[2731.30 → 2731.66] Here
[2731.66 → 2733.72] As his first example
[2733.72 → 2734.38] Of judgment
[2734.38 → 2735.62] And there's more to come
[2735.62 → 2737.32] It's not because
[2737.32 → 2738.58] He has a particular
[2738.58 → 2739.52] Hang up
[2739.52 → 2741.26] About homosexuality
[2741.26 → 2742.24] It's not like
[2742.24 → 2743.12] Paul's not like
[2743.12 → 2743.54] You know
[2743.54 → 2744.38] As a Jew
[2744.38 → 2745.22] We just don't do
[2745.22 → 2745.98] This kind of thing
[2745.98 → 2746.90] So I'm just going to
[2746.90 → 2747.66] Pick on that first
[2747.66 → 2748.88] That's not what
[2748.88 → 2749.34] He's saying
[2749.34 → 2751.44] What
[2751.44 → 2753.14] Is happening here
[2753.14 → 2754.08] Is that this
[2754.08 → 2755.00] Is a form
[2755.00 → 2756.22] Of God's
[2756.22 → 2757.78] Poetic justice
[2757.78 → 2760.14] His poetic judgment
[2760.14 → 2762.10] It's a poetic form
[2762.10 → 2762.54] Of judgment
[2762.54 → 2763.40] Let me explain
[2763.40 → 2765.24] God is regularly
[2765.24 → 2766.22] Doing this in the Bible
[2766.22 → 2766.80] Okay
[2766.80 → 2768.06] Where a judgment
[2768.06 → 2769.28] Befalls his people
[2769.28 → 2770.48] Or another nation
[2770.48 → 2772.34] That is ironic
[2772.34 → 2773.60] That is poetic
[2773.60 → 2774.72] Let me give you
[2774.72 → 2775.20] An example
[2775.20 → 2777.08] In the book of Numbers
[2777.08 → 2779.72] There are twelve spies
[2779.72 → 2780.92] Who are sent out
[2780.92 → 2782.48] Into the promised land
[2782.48 → 2783.66] There to go
[2783.66 → 2784.80] And check out the land
[2784.80 → 2785.62] This land
[2785.62 → 2786.04] This land that God
[2786.04 → 2786.86] Wants them to go
[2786.86 → 2787.26] And possess
[2787.26 → 2788.16] And to settle in
[2788.16 → 2790.10] The spies come back
[2790.10 → 2791.16] They say
[2791.16 → 2792.64] It is a good land
[2792.64 → 2793.94] But the people there
[2793.94 → 2794.58] Are bigger
[2794.58 → 2795.86] They're more intimidating
[2795.86 → 2797.26] If we attack
[2797.26 → 2799.18] Them as God says
[2799.18 → 2800.08] They will kill us
[2800.08 → 2801.96] And they wouldn't
[2801.96 → 2803.16] Spare our
[2803.16 → 2804.16] Young ones
[2804.16 → 2806.96] God's punishes
[2806.96 → 2807.72] He punishes them
[2807.72 → 2808.64] He judges them
[2808.64 → 2809.74] For their disbelief
[2809.74 → 2811.12] For not believing
[2811.12 → 2811.74] His word
[2811.74 → 2811.96] Right
[2811.96 → 2812.88] It's a common theme
[2812.88 → 2813.68] Throughout the whole Bible
[2813.68 → 2817.50] And the irony
[2817.50 → 2819.16] The poetic form
[2819.16 → 2819.80] Of the judgment
[2819.80 → 2821.26] Is you will die
[2821.26 → 2822.50] Outside the land
[2822.50 → 2824.36] And your young ones
[2824.36 → 2825.40] Who you thought
[2825.40 → 2826.20] Would be killed
[2826.20 → 2828.06] They are the only ones
[2828.06 → 2829.16] Who will go
[2829.16 → 2829.82] Into the land
[2829.82 → 2830.88] Right
[2830.88 → 2831.44] Okay
[2831.44 → 2832.86] So it's this poetic judgment
[2832.86 → 2835.12] That's what God is doing
[2835.12 → 2835.94] Here in Romans 1
[2835.94 → 2837.34] There's
[2837.34 → 2839.26] The significance
[2839.26 → 2840.38] Of that exchange
[2840.38 → 2841.00] Language here
[2841.00 → 2841.74] They've exchanged
[2841.74 → 2842.48] The immortal
[2842.48 → 2843.58] Transcendent God
[2843.58 → 2845.44] For creaturely things
[2845.44 → 2846.76] And in judgment
[2846.76 → 2848.02] God gives us over
[2848.02 → 2849.22] Such that
[2849.22 → 2850.26] In our culture
[2850.26 → 2851.22] Not every single person
[2851.22 → 2851.94] But in culture
[2851.94 → 2852.34] In general
[2852.34 → 2853.00] In humanity
[2853.00 → 2854.82] From Paul's day
[2854.82 → 2855.90] All the way to today
[2855.90 → 2859.74] It becomes a culture
[2859.74 → 2860.50] Where men
[2860.50 → 2861.46] Exchange women
[2861.46 → 2862.02] For men
[2862.02 → 2864.70] Where women
[2864.70 → 2865.98] Exchange sexual practice
[2865.98 → 2866.54] With man
[2866.54 → 2866.96] For that
[2866.96 → 2867.80] With another woman
[2867.80 → 2869.22] And it is
[2869.22 → 2870.12] Symbolically
[2870.12 → 2870.78] Representative
[2870.78 → 2872.12] Of what we all
[2872.12 → 2872.96] Are doing
[2872.96 → 2874.46] In our idolatry
[2874.46 → 2876.90] So the idolatry
[2876.90 → 2878.40] That is present
[2878.40 → 2879.62] In all of our sin
[2879.62 → 2880.32] Where all of us
[2880.32 → 2881.78] Are just exchanging God
[2881.78 → 2883.32] For seeking life
[2883.32 → 2884.06] In the creature
[2884.06 → 2886.06] This is powerfully
[2886.06 → 2887.36] Portrayed
[2887.36 → 2888.78] In this one
[2888.78 → 2889.64] Particular sin
[2889.64 → 2891.46] Where we
[2891.46 → 2892.62] Don't prefer the other
[2892.62 → 2893.84] But we prefer the sameness
[2893.84 → 2894.66] Of the creation
[2894.66 → 2896.28] That's why
[2896.28 → 2897.42] It's highlighted here
[2897.42 → 2898.82] So Paul is not
[2898.82 → 2899.40] Saying
[2899.40 → 2901.06] That this particular sin
[2901.06 → 2902.46] Of same sex practice
[2902.46 → 2903.72] Is the pinnacle of sin
[2903.72 → 2904.70] He's not saying
[2904.70 → 2905.82] That it's the height of sin
[2905.82 → 2907.08] It's not the worst sin
[2907.08 → 2908.48] That's not the argument
[2908.48 → 2909.10] He's making
[2909.10 → 2910.42] His argument
[2910.42 → 2911.24] Is that this sin
[2911.24 → 2911.88] Is symbolic
[2911.88 → 2913.00] Of all human sin
[2913.00 → 2914.50] It's a sin
[2914.50 → 2915.16] In which we see
[2915.16 → 2915.80] Very clearly
[2915.80 → 2916.72] What sin
[2916.72 → 2917.50] Is
[2917.50 → 2919.42] Which is our refusal
[2919.42 → 2920.12] To acknowledge
[2920.12 → 2920.78] God as God
[2920.78 → 2921.62] And to worship him
[2921.62 → 2922.58] Right
[2922.58 → 2923.74] And so God is wise
[2923.74 → 2924.50] He is good
[2924.50 → 2925.58] He is loving
[2925.58 → 2927.60] He made male and female
[2927.60 → 2929.00] He knew what he was doing
[2929.00 → 2931.40] And a homosexual relationship
[2931.40 → 2932.34] Says to God
[2932.34 → 2933.92] I disagree with your wisdom
[2933.92 → 2934.82] Your goodness
[2934.82 → 2935.88] Your creation
[2935.88 → 2938.54] And I will choose my way
[2938.54 → 2939.18] Not your way
[2939.18 → 2941.38] And so God gives them
[2941.38 → 2943.24] Over to same sex behaviour
[2943.24 → 2944.06] As a sign
[2944.06 → 2945.12] Of what has gone wrong
[2945.12 → 2946.44] In every single one
[2946.44 → 2947.02] Of our hearts
[2947.02 → 2949.76] So according to Romans 1
[2949.76 → 2950.78] Homosexual practice
[2950.78 → 2952.12] Is not the reason
[2952.12 → 2952.98] For God's judgment
[2952.98 → 2955.40] But is the result of it
[2955.40 → 2957.22] It's God giving us over
[2957.22 → 2959.78] And that is not the only sin
[2959.78 → 2960.64] Paul talks about
[2960.64 → 2962.28] Because he goes on
[2962.28 → 2964.26] In verses 29 to 31
[2964.26 → 2965.74] He gives us this long list
[2965.74 → 2967.00] Of 21
[2967.00 → 2969.18] Further examples
[2969.18 → 2971.22] Of disordered relationships
[2971.22 → 2972.14] Between people
[2972.14 → 2973.90] None of which talk about
[2973.90 → 2974.90] Sexuality at all
[2974.90 → 2977.26] Now this is a difficult passage
[2977.26 → 2977.76] To read
[2977.76 → 2978.94] But let's look at it again
[2978.94 → 2980.72] Beginning in verse 29
[2980.72 → 2982.30] He says
[2982.30 → 2984.60] They have become filled
[2984.60 → 2985.94] Right
[2985.94 → 2987.06] We empty ourselves of God
[2987.06 → 2988.10] And we fill ourselves up
[2988.10 → 2989.52] With all kinds of wickedness
[2989.52 → 2989.88] Evil
[2989.88 → 2990.30] Greed
[2990.30 → 2990.90] Depravity
[2990.90 → 2991.90] Full
[2991.90 → 2992.74] Of envy
[2992.74 → 2993.16] Murder
[2993.16 → 2993.82] Strife
[2993.82 → 2994.58] Deceit
[2994.58 → 2995.32] And malice
[2995.32 → 2996.74] They are gossips
[2996.74 → 2998.20] Slanderers
[2998.20 → 2998.84] God haters
[2998.84 → 2999.44] Insulin
[2999.44 → 3000.04] Arrogant
[3000.04 → 3000.60] Boastful
[3000.60 → 3002.26] They invent ways
[3002.26 → 3002.92] Of doing evil
[3002.92 → 3005.12] They disobey their parents
[3005.12 → 3005.84] Kids are like
[3005.84 → 3006.46] Wait what?
[3006.84 → 3007.60] Why is that there?
[3008.88 → 3009.34] Murder
[3009.34 → 3010.44] Disobedience of parents
[3010.44 → 3011.02] It's together
[3011.02 → 3013.06] They have no understanding
[3013.06 → 3014.24] No fidelity
[3014.24 → 3015.14] No love
[3015.14 → 3016.06] No mercy
[3016.06 → 3019.32] Right?
[3019.36 → 3020.70] Paul is just letting flow
[3020.70 → 3022.20] This list of sins
[3022.20 → 3024.50] Of human beings
[3024.50 → 3025.56] Choosing to go
[3025.56 → 3026.60] Our own way
[3026.60 → 3028.32] And how society
[3028.32 → 3030.00] Disintegrates
[3030.00 → 3032.08] As the moral fabric
[3032.08 → 3034.02] Is torn at the seams
[3034.02 → 3036.48] And as we read
[3036.48 → 3037.68] This catalogue of sins
[3037.68 → 3039.40] If we're honest
[3039.40 → 3040.54] There is no doubt
[3040.54 → 3041.04] About it
[3041.04 → 3041.34] That
[3041.34 → 3042.88] Any of us
[3042.88 → 3044.08] Could remain standing
[3044.08 → 3045.98] That any of us
[3045.98 → 3046.16] Could
[3046.16 → 3047.72] Do not see ourselves
[3047.72 → 3048.66] Falling in
[3048.66 → 3049.54] To one
[3049.54 → 3050.50] Or many
[3050.50 → 3052.00] Of these sins
[3052.00 → 3052.88] That are described here
[3052.88 → 3053.94] Either in action
[3053.94 → 3055.00] Or in attitude
[3055.00 → 3057.68] So Paul is saying
[3057.68 → 3059.02] This isn't a case of
[3059.02 → 3060.00] You know
[3060.00 → 3060.58] He's also saying
[3060.58 → 3061.38] It's not a case of
[3061.38 → 3062.36] People not knowing
[3062.36 → 3063.58] It's not a case of
[3063.58 → 3064.34] Ignorance
[3064.34 → 3066.12] Who haven't been taught
[3066.12 → 3067.26] Because he goes on
[3067.26 → 3068.24] In verse 32
[3068.24 → 3069.76] Although
[3069.76 → 3071.42] They know
[3071.42 → 3072.84] God's righteous decree
[3072.84 → 3074.42] That those who do such things
[3074.42 → 3075.16] Deserve death
[3075.16 → 3078.62] How is it that we know
[3078.62 → 3079.48] We deserve death
[3079.48 → 3081.20] When we
[3081.20 → 3082.88] Commit these sins
[3082.88 → 3083.48] This because
[3083.48 → 3085.00] We are made in God's image
[3085.00 → 3086.76] We know what is right
[3086.76 → 3087.12] And wrong
[3087.12 → 3087.74] We know that we
[3087.74 → 3088.80] Shouldn't do these things
[3088.80 → 3091.44] Then he continues
[3091.44 → 3092.44] In verse 32
[3092.44 → 3093.40] They not only
[3093.40 → 3094.24] Continue to do
[3094.24 → 3095.16] These very things
[3095.16 → 3096.18] But approve
[3096.18 → 3097.80] Of those who practice them
[3097.80 → 3100.20] In that
[3100.20 → 3101.88] That construction
[3101.88 → 3102.72] Not only
[3102.72 → 3104.22] But also
[3104.22 → 3105.48] They not only
[3105.48 → 3105.98] Continue
[3105.98 → 3107.26] To do these things
[3107.26 → 3108.82] But also approve
[3108.82 → 3110.46] Of those who practice them
[3110.46 → 3112.22] It means that
[3112.22 → 3112.94] People who
[3112.94 → 3114.44] Approve of sinners
[3114.44 → 3115.74] Doing sinful deeds
[3115.74 → 3117.52] Who label sin
[3117.52 → 3118.84] As good
[3118.84 → 3119.44] Or natural
[3119.44 → 3120.14] Or noble
[3120.14 → 3121.64] Are worse
[3121.64 → 3122.42] Than the sinners
[3122.42 → 3123.24] Themselves
[3123.24 → 3125.10] Not only do they do them
[3125.10 → 3126.26] They approve
[3126.26 → 3127.50] Of those who practice them
[3127.50 → 3129.90] Why?
[3130.08 → 3130.88] Because it does
[3130.88 → 3131.86] Great damage
[3131.86 → 3132.94] To the moral fabric
[3132.94 → 3133.56] Of society
[3133.56 → 3134.52] When sin
[3134.52 → 3135.36] Becomes
[3135.36 → 3136.44] Acceptable
[3136.44 → 3137.72] When it becomes
[3137.72 → 3138.56] Approved
[3138.56 → 3139.58] By a society
[3139.58 → 3143.26] So the worst is over
[3143.26 → 3145.76] Maybe
[3145.76 → 3146.54] Let's talk about
[3146.54 → 3147.14] Some application
[3147.14 → 3149.64] The first thing
[3149.64 → 3150.28] I want to say
[3150.28 → 3152.54] Is that we need
[3152.54 → 3153.48] To listen to God
[3153.48 → 3154.84] And believe
[3154.84 → 3155.68] What the Bible
[3155.68 → 3156.40] Tells us
[3156.40 → 3157.04] About sin
[3157.04 → 3158.36] Including the sin
[3158.36 → 3159.76] Of homosexual practice
[3159.76 → 3162.14] There is a
[3162.14 → 3163.18] Pastor and writer
[3163.18 → 3163.72] By the name
[3163.72 → 3164.40] Of Sam
[3164.40 → 3165.08] Albury
[3165.08 → 3166.60] He wrote a book
[3166.60 → 3166.96] Called
[3166.96 → 3167.46] Is God
[3167.46 → 3168.04] Anti-gay
[3168.04 → 3168.96] It's a very good book
[3168.96 → 3171.22] Some years ago
[3171.22 → 3172.24] He spoke before
[3172.24 → 3172.96] Some of the leaders
[3172.96 → 3173.54] Of the church
[3173.54 → 3173.98] In England
[3173.98 → 3175.98] He is a Christian man
[3175.98 → 3177.06] He is a godly man
[3177.06 → 3177.78] He's a pastor
[3177.78 → 3178.94] Who struggles
[3178.94 → 3180.32] With same-sex attraction
[3180.32 → 3182.80] And he said this
[3182.80 → 3183.70] At the church
[3183.70 → 3184.82] Of England's
[3184.82 → 3185.16] Synod
[3185.16 → 3186.72] He said this
[3186.72 → 3188.22] I am
[3188.22 → 3189.32] Same-sex attracted
[3189.32 → 3190.82] And have been
[3190.82 → 3191.98] My entire life
[3191.98 → 3193.72] By that
[3193.72 → 3194.60] I mean
[3194.60 → 3195.80] That I have
[3195.80 → 3196.42] Sexual
[3196.42 → 3197.50] Romantic
[3197.50 → 3198.50] And deep
[3198.50 → 3199.34] Emotional
[3199.34 → 3200.36] Attractions
[3200.36 → 3201.36] To people
[3201.36 → 3202.22] Of the same
[3202.22 → 3202.70] Sex
[3202.70 → 3204.78] I have met
[3204.78 → 3205.30] Literally
[3205.30 → 3206.08] Hundreds of
[3206.08 → 3206.40] Christians
[3206.40 → 3207.44] In my situation
[3207.44 → 3208.90] I know
[3208.90 → 3209.48] Thousands
[3209.48 → 3210.10] More
[3210.10 → 3211.30] Who are
[3211.30 → 3212.58] Same-sex attracted
[3212.58 → 3213.70] And who
[3213.70 → 3214.42] Joyfully
[3214.42 → 3215.22] Affirm
[3215.22 → 3216.40] The traditional
[3216.40 → 3217.00] Understanding
[3217.00 → 3217.64] Of marriage
[3217.64 → 3218.30] Being between
[3218.30 → 3219.18] A man and a woman
[3219.18 → 3220.60] And the only
[3220.60 → 3221.14] Godly
[3221.14 → 3221.98] Context
[3221.98 → 3223.06] For sex
[3223.06 → 3224.62] If you don't
[3224.62 → 3225.18] Hear from
[3225.18 → 3225.86] More of us
[3225.86 → 3226.86] It is because
[3226.86 → 3227.78] It is very hard
[3227.78 → 3228.68] To stand up
[3228.68 → 3229.74] And to describe
[3229.74 → 3230.32] Ourselves
[3230.32 → 3231.26] In this way
[3231.26 → 3234.20] Then he goes on
[3234.20 → 3234.70] To say something
[3234.70 → 3235.66] That is profoundly
[3235.66 → 3236.12] Sad
[3236.12 → 3237.80] He says
[3237.80 → 3238.60] I was bullied
[3238.60 → 3239.32] At school
[3239.32 → 3240.12] For being gay
[3240.12 → 3242.38] I now feel
[3242.38 → 3242.92] I am being
[3242.92 → 3243.34] Bullied
[3243.34 → 3244.04] In the church
[3244.04 → 3245.14] For being
[3245.14 → 3246.22] Same-sex attracted
[3246.22 → 3247.62] And faithful
[3247.62 → 3248.80] To the teaching
[3248.80 → 3249.34] Of Jesus
[3249.34 → 3250.12] On marriage
[3250.12 → 3255.00] The place
[3255.00 → 3256.84] Where he
[3256.84 → 3257.56] Should be
[3257.56 → 3258.80] Comforted
[3258.80 → 3260.78] Where he
[3260.78 → 3261.16] Should be
[3261.16 → 3262.10] Protected
[3262.10 → 3263.72] Welcomed
[3263.72 → 3264.84] Supported
[3264.84 → 3266.66] Affirmed
[3266.66 → 3268.30] Is the place
[3268.30 → 3268.94] Where he is being
[3268.94 → 3269.30] Bullied
[3269.30 → 3269.84] And attacked
[3269.84 → 3271.22] In the church
[3271.22 → 3274.28] And I know
[3274.28 → 3275.02] That for some
[3275.02 → 3275.56] Of us here
[3275.56 → 3275.86] You know
[3275.86 → 3276.88] We rightly
[3276.88 → 3277.50] Affirm
[3277.50 → 3278.14] The dignity
[3278.14 → 3278.96] Of all people
[3278.96 → 3280.92] We are rightly
[3280.92 → 3281.80] Horrified
[3281.80 → 3282.72] By the way
[3282.72 → 3283.24] That people
[3283.24 → 3283.90] Talk about
[3283.90 → 3284.48] And treat
[3284.48 → 3285.02] Those with
[3285.02 → 3285.90] Same-sex attraction
[3285.90 → 3287.50] In society
[3287.50 → 3288.16] And especially
[3288.16 → 3288.88] In the church
[3288.88 → 3290.24] But that should
[3290.24 → 3291.20] Not lead us
[3291.20 → 3292.16] Then to dismiss
[3292.16 → 3292.84] What the Bible
[3292.84 → 3293.42] Says
[3293.42 → 3294.46] About homosexual
[3294.46 → 3295.04] Practice
[3295.04 → 3296.38] And that it
[3296.38 → 3297.12] Really does say
[3297.12 → 3297.98] That it is a sin
[3297.98 → 3300.24] So we need
[3300.24 → 3300.74] To take that
[3300.74 → 3301.28] Seriously
[3301.28 → 3302.62] And not try
[3302.62 → 3303.26] To write that
[3303.26 → 3303.78] Out of scripture
[3303.78 → 3304.84] Not try to fudge it
[3304.84 → 3306.66] And we need
[3306.66 → 3307.16] To not let
[3307.16 → 3307.80] What our culture
[3307.80 → 3308.56] Says about
[3308.56 → 3309.34] Sexual ethics
[3309.34 → 3309.94] In Paul's day
[3309.94 → 3310.52] Or today
[3310.52 → 3311.64] Shape us more
[3311.64 → 3312.36] Than the word
[3312.36 → 3312.82] Of God
[3312.82 → 3313.82] Shapes us
[3313.82 → 3317.28] Second thing
[3317.28 → 3317.98] I want us to say
[3317.98 → 3318.96] By way of application
[3318.96 → 3320.20] Is that for some
[3320.20 → 3321.10] Of us as Christians
[3321.10 → 3322.50] We are so concerned
[3322.50 → 3324.00] About the acceptance
[3324.00 → 3325.32] Of homosexual
[3325.32 → 3326.54] Practice in our
[3326.54 → 3326.90] Culture
[3326.90 → 3327.60] And especially
[3327.60 → 3328.32] In the church
[3328.32 → 3329.90] That we can forget
[3329.90 → 3330.56] That the Bible
[3330.56 → 3331.46] Is not just about
[3331.46 → 3332.64] That one particular sin
[3332.64 → 3334.12] But that it's about
[3334.12 → 3335.20] A lot of sins
[3335.20 → 3336.22] It's about
[3336.22 → 3337.20] Your sins
[3337.20 → 3338.40] Not just
[3338.40 → 3339.98] Other people's sins
[3339.98 → 3342.34] And if we only
[3342.34 → 3343.70] Focus our attention
[3343.70 → 3345.60] On the particular sin
[3345.60 → 3347.06] Of homosexual practice
[3347.06 → 3348.38] Which occurs
[3348.38 → 3348.88] In a list
[3348.88 → 3350.28] Of lots of other sins
[3350.28 → 3351.40] We can be
[3351.40 → 3352.04] In the dangerous
[3352.04 → 3353.08] Position of forgetting
[3353.08 → 3354.00] That all of us
[3354.00 → 3354.76] Are guilty
[3354.76 → 3355.90] Of idolatry
[3355.90 → 3359.24] There's a video
[3359.24 → 3359.78] That you can find
[3359.78 → 3360.18] On YouTube
[3360.18 → 3361.80] Of Pastor Tim Keller
[3361.80 → 3365.42] At Columbia University
[3365.42 → 3367.56] Having this whole room
[3367.56 → 3368.62] Of university students
[3368.62 → 3369.36] Question him
[3369.36 → 3370.16] About all kinds
[3370.16 → 3370.62] Of things
[3370.62 → 3372.90] And one of the questions
[3372.90 → 3373.52] Of course
[3373.52 → 3374.72] He has to respond to
[3374.72 → 3375.10] Is
[3375.10 → 3376.60] Is homosexuality
[3376.60 → 3377.08] A sin?
[3377.62 → 3378.90] Do people go to hell
[3378.90 → 3380.50] Because they are homosexuals?
[3380.92 → 3381.62] That's what our culture
[3381.62 → 3382.26] Wants to know
[3382.26 → 3384.54] To which he replies
[3384.54 → 3386.64] You don't go to hell
[3386.64 → 3387.66] For being a homosexual
[3387.66 → 3389.86] Because you don't go to heaven
[3389.86 → 3391.32] For being a heterosexual
[3391.32 → 3394.08] He says instead
[3394.08 → 3395.22] What sends you to hell
[3395.22 → 3396.52] Is self-righteousness
[3396.52 → 3397.92] Thinking that you can be
[3397.92 → 3398.98] Your own saviour and lord
[3398.98 → 3400.82] And what sends you to heaven
[3400.82 → 3401.56] Is admitting
[3401.56 → 3402.72] That you are a sinner
[3402.72 → 3404.10] And that you need
[3404.10 → 3405.78] Intervention from the outside
[3405.78 → 3407.36] You need to turn to Jesus
[3407.36 → 3408.20] Who comes
[3408.20 → 3409.46] And offers you
[3409.46 → 3410.70] His intervention
[3410.70 → 3413.00] You know
[3413.00 → 3413.70] In some Christians
[3413.70 → 3414.82] We ignore what the Bible
[3414.82 → 3415.24] Teaches
[3415.24 → 3416.86] About homosexuality
[3417.64 → 3418.48] In order to love
[3418.48 → 3419.06] Our gay neighbour
[3419.06 → 3420.54] Others
[3420.54 → 3421.90] Take seriously
[3421.90 → 3422.68] What the Bible says
[3422.68 → 3423.94] About homosexuality
[3423.94 → 3426.02] But in a self-righteous way
[3426.02 → 3427.12] That condemns our neighbours
[3427.12 → 3429.22] And it keeps them
[3429.22 → 3430.92] From the gospel
[3430.92 → 3431.80] Those who
[3431.80 → 3433.40] Are self-righteous
[3433.40 → 3434.18] It keeps them away
[3434.18 → 3434.76] From the gospel
[3434.76 → 3435.46] Which tells us
[3435.46 → 3436.68] That we all are sinners
[3436.68 → 3437.88] And that we all
[3437.88 → 3438.58] Need Jesus
[3438.58 → 3439.38] To be our saviour
[3439.38 → 3442.92] And so for all of us
[3442.92 → 3443.42] This morning
[3443.42 → 3445.80] Whatever of these sins
[3445.80 → 3446.86] That we struggle with
[3446.86 → 3449.64] The invitation to us
[3449.64 → 3450.70] Every one of us
[3450.70 → 3452.06] No matter what
[3452.06 → 3453.80] We struggle with
[3453.80 → 3454.14] Again
[3454.14 → 3455.58] Is the invitation
[3455.58 → 3456.58] To come to Jesus
[3456.58 → 3458.02] That's the invitation
[3458.02 → 3460.60] So I want to share with you
[3460.60 → 3461.64] This section
[3461.64 → 3462.30] From
[3462.30 → 3464.00] Dane Portland's book
[3464.00 → 3464.40] It's called
[3464.40 → 3466.20] The Gentle and Lowly
[3466.20 → 3467.58] The Heart of Christ
[3467.58 → 3468.82] For Sinners and Sufferers
[3468.82 → 3470.84] And so he has this dialogue
[3470.84 → 3473.08] Of us
[3473.08 → 3474.18] Being hesitant
[3474.18 → 3475.48] To come to Jesus
[3475.48 → 3477.70] And Jesus' response
[3477.70 → 3478.26] To us
[3478.26 → 3480.08] So let me read this
[3480.08 → 3480.94] This for you
[3480.94 → 3482.56] And this will be
[3482.56 → 3483.76] We'll conclude with this
[3483.76 → 3486.92] No wait
[3486.92 → 3488.40] We say
[3488.40 → 3490.66] Cautiously approaching Jesus
[3490.66 → 3491.94] You don't understand
[3491.94 → 3495.86] I've really messed up
[3495.86 → 3498.06] In all kinds of ways
[3498.06 → 3500.30] I know
[3500.30 → 3501.80] Jesus responds
[3501.80 → 3503.58] Well you know
[3503.58 → 3504.52] Most of it sure
[3504.52 → 3505.70] Certainly more
[3505.70 → 3506.78] Than what others see
[3506.78 → 3508.60] But there's a perversity
[3508.60 → 3509.50] Down inside me
[3509.50 → 3510.46] That is hidden
[3510.46 → 3511.14] From everyone
[3511.14 → 3513.48] I know it all
[3513.48 → 3515.56] Well the thing is
[3515.56 → 3516.82] It isn't just my past
[3516.82 → 3518.06] It is my present too
[3518.06 → 3520.64] I understand
[3520.64 → 3523.22] But I don't know
[3523.22 → 3524.22] If I can break free
[3524.22 → 3524.84] Of this
[3524.84 → 3526.68] Anytime soon
[3526.68 → 3528.90] That's the only kind
[3528.90 → 3529.28] Of person
[3529.28 → 3530.08] I'm here to help
[3530.08 → 3532.88] The burden
[3532.88 → 3533.62] Is heavy
[3533.62 → 3535.30] And heavier
[3535.30 → 3536.20] All the time
[3536.20 → 3538.84] Then let me carry it
[3538.84 → 3541.70] It's too much
[3541.70 → 3542.18] To bear
[3542.18 → 3544.36] Not for me
[3544.36 → 3546.38] You don't get it
[3546.38 → 3546.60] Jesus
[3546.60 → 3547.22] My offences
[3547.22 → 3547.80] Aren't directed
[3547.80 → 3548.56] Towards others
[3548.56 → 3550.18] They're against you
[3550.18 → 3552.64] Then I am the one
[3552.64 → 3553.20] Most suited
[3553.20 → 3554.56] To forgive them
[3554.56 → 3556.62] But the more
[3556.62 → 3558.00] Of the ugliness
[3558.00 → 3558.50] In me
[3558.50 → 3559.28] You discover
[3559.28 → 3560.60] The sooner
[3560.60 → 3561.42] You'll get fed up
[3561.42 → 3561.86] With me
[3561.86 → 3564.80] Whoever comes
[3564.80 → 3565.30] To me
[3565.30 → 3566.84] I will never
[3566.84 → 3567.50] Cast out
[3567.50 → 3570.30] Let's pray
[3570.30 → 3575.30] Lord Jesus
[3575.30 → 3576.38] We come to you
[3576.38 → 3580.10] You are the fullness
[3580.10 → 3581.34] And the fountain
[3581.34 → 3582.20] Of mercy
[3582.20 → 3583.34] And Lord
[3583.34 → 3584.28] Each one of us
[3584.28 → 3584.94] Here this morning
[3584.94 → 3586.92] Needs your mercy
[3586.92 → 3589.32] Draw each of us
[3589.32 → 3589.62] Lord
[3589.62 → 3590.98] Sinners that we are
[3590.98 → 3591.86] To yourself
[3591.86 → 3592.46] This morning
[3592.46 → 3594.12] Help us to turn
[3594.12 → 3595.34] From unrighteousness
[3595.34 → 3596.44] In all of its forms
[3596.44 → 3598.06] And help us to turn
[3598.06 → 3598.46] To you
[3598.46 → 3599.26] By your grace
[3599.26 → 3601.40] We thank you
[3601.40 → 3601.88] Lord
[3601.88 → 3603.00] That Christ came
[3603.00 → 3603.84] The righteous one
[3603.84 → 3605.58] To die for the unrighteous
[3605.58 → 3607.28] So that we might
[3607.28 → 3608.44] Become like him
[3608.44 → 3609.72] By his grace
[3609.72 → 3611.58] Lord would you do
[3611.58 → 3612.22] This in us
[3612.22 → 3613.08] We pray
[3613.08 → 3614.50] We pray this
[3614.50 → 3615.22] In Jesus name
[3615.22 → 3616.14] Amen
[3616.14 → 3635.54] Please rise to sing
[3635.54 → 3650.08] Take my life
[3650.08 → 3652.78] And let it be
[3652.78 → 3655.50] Was there great
[3655.50 → 3658.12] A lot to be
[3658.12 → 3660.84] Take my moment
[3660.84 → 3663.72] And my days
[3663.72 → 3666.12] Let them flow
[3666.12 → 3669.08] In endless ways
[3669.08 → 3671.46] Let them flow
[3671.46 → 3674.58] In endless ways
[3674.58 → 3678.30] Take my hands
[3678.30 → 3681.06] And let them move
[3681.06 → 3684.34] Now the impulse
[3684.34 → 3686.46] Of the Lord
[3686.46 → 3689.04] Take my feet
[3689.04 → 3691.90] And let them be
[3691.90 → 3695.04] Swift and beautiful
[3695.04 → 3697.08] For thee
[3697.08 → 3699.92] Swift and beautiful
[3699.92 → 3702.58] For thee
[3702.58 → 3706.70] Take my will
[3706.70 → 3709.44] And make it thine
[3709.44 → 3712.04] This shall be
[3712.04 → 3714.76] No longer mine
[3714.76 → 3717.50] Take my heart
[3717.50 → 3719.50] In Israel
[3719.50 → 3722.86] He shall be
[3722.86 → 3725.64] The royal throne
[3725.64 → 3727.50] He shall be
