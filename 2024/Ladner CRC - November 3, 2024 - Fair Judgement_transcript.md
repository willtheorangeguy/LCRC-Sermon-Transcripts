[0.00 --> 2.00]  How are you?
[2.00 --> 3.00]  Amen!
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 302.00]  Amen.
[330.00 --> 354.00]  Amen.
[354.00 --> 356.00]  Good morning, everyone.
[356.00 --> 357.00]  Good morning.
[357.00 --> 359.04]  Nice to see you all here. It's good to be with you.
[359.46 --> 365.54]  My name is Jason, and it is my privilege this morning to welcome you to worship at Ladner Christian Reformed Church
[365.54 --> 369.02]  and to also lead us in our worship this morning.
[371.22 --> 372.64]  I didn't grab my bulletin.
[372.64 --> 372.66]  I think I'm going to grab my bulletin.
[382.14 --> 384.12]  I figure there must be some announcements.
[385.32 --> 385.64]  Yes.
[386.24 --> 390.02]  Next week, there is a soup and bun lunch.
[390.74 --> 396.52]  And so I think we're looking for a couple more people to make soup, but there is a sign-up sheet on the foyer table.
[397.00 --> 398.72]  But next week, all are invited.
[398.72 --> 404.58]  Please plan to stay and have lunch together and a time of fellowship.
[405.36 --> 409.64]  Also next week at 2 o'clock, there is singing at Mountain View Care Home.
[411.02 --> 415.56]  And if you have any questions, I believe Bart is in charge of that this week.
[415.64 --> 418.58]  In place of Marion, who is in Greece visiting Hannah.
[420.32 --> 425.52]  Another thing is, you know, later in the service we have a time to greet one another.
[425.52 --> 433.40]  And I know that some people, you know, that makes them a little bit uncomfortable, especially as we are heading into flu season.
[433.40 --> 436.30]  I've been kind of struggling with a cold the last two weeks.
[436.30 --> 442.22]  And so as we stand and greet one another, you know, if you want, go ahead and shake hands.
[442.64 --> 445.30]  But, you know, maybe not everyone is going to want to do that.
[445.46 --> 445.68]  Okay.
[445.72 --> 448.92]  So maybe just keep that in your mind and wave, smile.
[448.92 --> 453.82]  But if someone doesn't, you know, reciprocate, it's not because they don't like you.
[454.04 --> 455.84]  It's because they don't want to get sick.
[456.24 --> 456.42]  Okay.
[456.44 --> 457.64]  So let's just all keep that in mind.
[459.14 --> 464.36]  Our Operation Christmas Child boxes are going to be available in the foyer right after the service.
[464.36 --> 466.84]  So, you know, we learned about that last week.
[466.92 --> 473.56]  So you can take a box, fill it with some things, and it would be a great blessing to a family.
[473.96 --> 476.34]  Or, sorry, a child in another place.
[479.64 --> 480.58]  Oh, let's see.
[481.08 --> 486.44]  There are some Christmas cards that you can purchase to support the work of Hannah Vanderkamp.
[486.44 --> 488.78]  And I think that's basically it.
[488.88 --> 494.54]  But actually, our designated offering for today is for World Renew, and it's for their Hunger Initiative.
[495.50 --> 498.62]  And so there's a short video that we're going to watch right now,
[498.98 --> 504.00]  and that will tell us more about the offering, which we will take later in our service.
[506.52 --> 508.98]  What if fish can mean an end to hunger?
[509.80 --> 510.62]  This is Maida.
[510.62 --> 516.64]  Her family lives in a region in Honduras where drought has made it difficult to grow food.
[517.30 --> 521.44]  But today, her garden abounds without leaving him from fish.
[522.16 --> 526.10]  Through World Renew, Maida and her family learn about aquaponics.
[526.94 --> 531.04]  Where they once struggled to get enough to eat, they are now food secure.
[532.00 --> 538.52]  For Maida, an aquaponics system allows her to grow fresh fruits and vegetables with minimal water and soil.
[538.52 --> 545.82]  The fish waste, which works as a natural fertilizer, combined with the constant flow of water,
[546.26 --> 549.68]  helps plants to grow much faster than they will in a field.
[550.44 --> 555.66]  When Maida's community first hear about aquaponics, they didn't believe it will work.
[556.34 --> 557.54]  But Maida had hope.
[558.12 --> 563.28]  Thanks to aquaponics, she now has enough fresh fruits and vegetables to feed herself,
[563.74 --> 566.04]  her four children, and her grandchildren.
[566.04 --> 573.56]  Today, Maida has become a community leader, training her neighbors to farm with aquaponics.
[574.48 --> 577.68]  Fish changed Maida's story from hunger to hope.
[578.52 --> 583.02]  When families have the tools they need to overcome hunger, lives change.
[583.78 --> 588.92]  Children grow healthy and strong, families rejoice in God's love and abundance,
[588.92 --> 592.44]  and communities walk together towards ending hunger.
[593.48 --> 596.82]  Today, when you support World Renew's World Hunger work,
[597.18 --> 601.52]  you're partnering with families like Maida's to change the story of hunger.
[601.52 --> 618.78]  World Renew's World Renew is an organization that is started by the CRC
[618.78 --> 621.94]  and does this kind of development work around the world.
[621.94 --> 625.80]  Okay, so that's all for announcements.
[626.08 --> 630.56]  Let's prepare our hearts to come before the Lord in worship.
[630.96 --> 635.86]  You know, and our God is gracious to us, and he calls us into his presence.
[636.50 --> 638.26]  He gathers us in his name.
[638.26 --> 646.12]  And he calls us to come into his house, into the assembly of his people, and to worship him together.
[647.00 --> 651.48]  So we'll have our call to worship from Psalm 63.
[651.80 --> 653.28]  I'll begin, and it'll be responsive.
[653.28 --> 658.06]  Oh God, you are my God.
[658.86 --> 660.14]  Earnestly I seek you.
[660.92 --> 662.40]  My soul thirsts for you.
[663.30 --> 665.44]  My flesh faints for you,
[665.86 --> 669.84]  as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[670.96 --> 674.56]  So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
[675.36 --> 677.84]  beholding your power and glory.
[678.84 --> 682.10]  Because your steadfast love is better than life,
[682.10 --> 684.44]  my lips will praise you.
[685.58 --> 689.14]  So I will bless you as long as I live.
[689.64 --> 692.56]  In your name I will lift up my hands.
[693.04 --> 697.46]  I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods.
[697.96 --> 701.28]  With singing lips my mouth will praise you.
[702.44 --> 707.36]  Would you join me as we lift up our hearts to the Lord in a prayer of adoration?
[707.64 --> 709.04]  Let's worship the Lord in prayer.
[709.04 --> 712.46]  Our gracious God, our Heavenly Father,
[712.62 --> 714.74]  we come this morning as your people
[714.74 --> 718.08]  with mouths open wide,
[718.38 --> 721.48]  with hearts open wide,
[721.72 --> 724.44]  with hands open wide.
[725.04 --> 727.00]  We need to hear from you.
[727.56 --> 728.96]  We need to see you.
[729.36 --> 732.00]  We need to be filled by you because
[732.00 --> 733.54]  we leak.
[734.58 --> 737.80]  We are so forgetful of who you are.
[738.96 --> 741.32]  Father, we know from experience
[741.32 --> 745.28]  that the things of this world do not truly satisfy us.
[745.70 --> 748.36]  That only you can give us deep joy.
[749.08 --> 751.92]  Only you can give us that deep sense of belonging
[751.92 --> 753.96]  that we long for.
[754.50 --> 757.08]  To belong to you, our Creator and our God.
[757.08 --> 760.02]  Lord, our souls grow weary
[760.02 --> 762.74]  as we walk on this pilgrim journey.
[763.84 --> 764.94]  And so we ask this morning
[764.94 --> 768.66]  that as we come before you in worship,
[769.32 --> 770.70]  that you would refresh us
[770.70 --> 772.08]  with your love.
[772.94 --> 773.90]  Would you help us
[773.90 --> 776.30]  to rest in your embrace
[776.30 --> 778.56]  through the power of the Holy Spirit?
[779.30 --> 780.82]  We pray in Jesus' name
[780.82 --> 781.70]  and for his sake.
[782.08 --> 782.38]  Amen.
[782.38 --> 784.50]  Let's all stand
[784.50 --> 786.36]  and receive God's greeting to us.
[788.08 --> 789.58]  Grace, mercy, and peace
[789.58 --> 790.56]  from God the Father,
[791.10 --> 792.44]  the Lord Jesus Christ,
[792.54 --> 794.44]  his Son, and our Savior,
[795.12 --> 796.56]  through the power and the presence
[796.56 --> 797.62]  of the Holy Spirit.
[798.58 --> 798.92]  Amen.
[799.62 --> 800.88]  As God has greeted us,
[800.96 --> 802.38]  let's turn and greet one another
[802.38 --> 804.10]  with a smile, with a wave.
[804.10 --> 804.22]  Amen.
[812.38 --> 818.38]  Amen.
[835.60 --> 836.42]  Amen.
[836.42 --> 836.76]  Amen.
[836.76 --> 837.10]  Amen.
[837.10 --> 837.52]  Amen.
[837.62 --> 838.02]  Amen.
[838.36 --> 839.50]  Okay.
[839.50 --> 840.54]  Amen.
[840.54 --> 841.44]  Amen.
[841.44 --> 841.48]  Amen.
[841.48 --> 842.00]  Amen.
[842.38 --> 844.38]  Amen.
[872.38 --> 881.96]  Lord, I bid your name on high, Lord, I love to see your praises.
[884.32 --> 893.96]  I'm so glad you made my heart, I'm so glad you came to save us.
[893.96 --> 923.94]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[924.96 --> 928.64]  Lord, I love to see your praises.
[931.16 --> 940.96]  I'm so glad you made my heart, I'm so glad you came to save us.
[940.96 --> 945.96]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[945.96 --> 954.68]  To show the way from the earth to the cross, my debt to pay.
[954.96 --> 960.64]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky,
[960.64 --> 965.32]  Lord, I bid to name our heart.
[965.32 --> 968.32]  I bid to save us.
[968.32 --> 970.32]  I bid to save us.
[970.32 --> 972.32]  I bid to save us.
[972.32 --> 973.32]  I bid to save us.
[973.32 --> 975.32]  I bid to save us.
[975.32 --> 976.32]  I bid to save us.
[976.32 --> 978.32]  I bid to save us.
[978.32 --> 979.32]  I bid to save us.
[979.32 --> 981.32]  I bid to save us.
[981.32 --> 983.32]  I bid to save us.
[983.32 --> 1001.18]  My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[1001.18 --> 1016.18]  All of my days, I want to place the wonders of your mighty love.
[1016.18 --> 1028.18]  My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength.
[1028.18 --> 1042.18]  Where we glad all that I am never cease to worship you.
[1042.18 --> 1050.18]  Shout to the Lord all the land that I sing.
[1050.18 --> 1056.18]  Power and majesty praise to the King.
[1056.18 --> 1062.18]  Mountains bow down and the seas will go.
[1062.18 --> 1069.18]  And the sound of your name.
[1069.18 --> 1076.18]  I sing your joy at the work of your help.
[1076.18 --> 1082.18]  Forever above you, forever I stand.
[1082.18 --> 1092.18]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1092.18 --> 1107.18]  My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[1107.18 --> 1122.18]  All of my days, I want to place the wonders of your mighty love.
[1122.18 --> 1134.18]  My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength.
[1134.18 --> 1149.18]  Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[1149.18 --> 1150.18]  My Lord, there is none like you.
[1150.18 --> 1151.18]  I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1151.18 --> 1152.18]  And the sound of your name.
[1152.18 --> 1154.18]  I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1154.18 --> 1155.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1155.18 --> 1156.18]  I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1156.18 --> 1158.18]  For ever, I love you, forever I stand.
[1158.18 --> 1159.18]  For ever, I love you, forever I stand.
[1159.18 --> 1161.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1161.18 --> 1163.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1163.18 --> 1164.18]  For ever, I love you, forever I stand.
[1164.18 --> 1166.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1166.18 --> 1168.18]  For ever, I love you, forever I stand.
[1168.18 --> 1175.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1175.18 --> 1180.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1180.18 --> 1185.18]  For ever, I love you, forever I stand.
[1185.18 --> 1204.18]  For ever, I sing your joy at the work of your glory.
[1204.18 --> 1210.18]  You may be seated.
[1210.18 --> 1214.18]  Our first scripture reading this morning comes from Psalm 98.
[1214.18 --> 1219.18]  So I encourage you to, if you'd like, follow along in your pew Bible.
[1219.18 --> 1221.18]  Psalm 98.
[1221.18 --> 1223.18]  We'll also have the words on the screen.
[1225.18 --> 1228.18]  In your pew Bible is on page 447.
[1228.18 --> 1229.18]  447.
[1234.18 --> 1236.18]  So this is Psalm 98.
[1236.18 --> 1239.18]  Sing to the Lord a new song.
[1239.18 --> 1242.18]  For he has done marvelous things.
[1242.18 --> 1247.18]  His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
[1247.18 --> 1250.18]  The Lord has made known his salvation,
[1250.18 --> 1255.18]  has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
[1255.18 --> 1260.18]  He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel.
[1260.18 --> 1264.18]  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[1264.18 --> 1267.18]  Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth.
[1267.18 --> 1270.18]  Burst into jubilant song with music.
[1270.18 --> 1272.18]  Make music to the Lord with the harp,
[1272.18 --> 1274.18]  with the harp and the sound of singing.
[1274.18 --> 1278.18]  With trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn.
[1278.18 --> 1281.18]  Shout for joy before the Lord the King.
[1281.18 --> 1284.18]  Let the sea resound in everything in it.
[1284.18 --> 1287.18]  The world and all who live in it.
[1287.18 --> 1289.18]  Let the rivers clap their hands.
[1289.18 --> 1292.18]  Let the mountains sing together for joy.
[1292.18 --> 1294.18]  Let them sing before the Lord.
[1294.18 --> 1297.18]  For he comes to judge the earth.
[1297.18 --> 1300.18]  He will judge the world in righteousness.
[1300.18 --> 1303.18]  In the peoples with equity.
[1303.18 --> 1305.18]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1305.18 --> 1315.18]  Let them sing before the Lord.
[1315.18 --> 1319.18]  Okay, so we have, you know, we have sung praises to God.
[1319.18 --> 1322.18]  We have heard his word.
[1322.18 --> 1327.18]  And now we confess our sins together corporately.
[1327.18 --> 1332.18]  And so I will lead us in a corporate confession of sin.
[1332.18 --> 1337.18]  And then I want to give you a moment to come before the Lord in a time of private confession.
[1337.18 --> 1342.18]  But first, would you join me in a prayer of confession?
[1342.18 --> 1351.18]  Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed.
[1351.18 --> 1356.18]  We have not loved you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[1356.18 --> 1360.18]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1360.18 --> 1363.18]  Deepen within us.
[1363.18 --> 1367.18]  Deepen within us sorrow for the wrong that we have done.
[1367.18 --> 1370.18]  And for the good that we have left undone.
[1370.18 --> 1374.18]  Lord, you are full of compassion and graciousness.
[1374.18 --> 1376.18]  You are slow to anger.
[1376.18 --> 1377.18]  You are rich in mercy.
[1377.18 --> 1380.18]  There is always forgiveness with you.
[1380.18 --> 1384.18]  Restore to us, Lord, the joy of our salvation.
[1384.18 --> 1388.18]  Bind up that which is broken in our hearts.
[1388.18 --> 1390.18]  Give light to our minds.
[1390.18 --> 1392.18]  Strengthen our wills.
[1392.18 --> 1397.18]  And give rest to our souls as we rest in your love.
[1397.18 --> 1399.18]  Speak to each of us, O Lord.
[1399.18 --> 1405.18]  Let your word abide with us until it has accomplished in us your holy will.
[1405.18 --> 1407.18]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1407.18 --> 1408.18]  Amen.
[1408.18 --> 1413.18]  And now the God who knows our thoughts, who sees what is in our hearts,
[1413.18 --> 1419.18]  invites us to come before him to confess the ways we have sinned against him
[1419.18 --> 1422.18]  and to look to him for his forgiveness.
[1422.18 --> 1424.18]  Amen.
[1424.18 --> 1425.18]  If this is Me, Fnuts, Guhaid.
[1425.18 --> 1427.18]  Lord, we are all all ar유.
[1427.18 --> 1429.18]  And bekeeping to God simple questions.
[1429.18 --> 1430.18]  Take care, for now our father's worlds.
[1430.18 --> 1432.18]  Hear unto us we hear about reveal of ourselves yours,
[1432.18 --> 1433.18]  one series of actions, and mercenaries.
[1433.18 --> 1434.18]  Prepare to leaf to our heart as they may be solve for us,
[1434.18 --> 1435.18]  neatly, and give us overha arise,
[1435.18 --> 1437.18]  we are doing the tune of our hearts,
[1437.18 --> 1451.06]  and then give us to the truth throughパ开开
[1451.76 --> 1455.08]  Lord, we thank you that even as we look to you for all things,
[1456.34 --> 1461.98]  we most especially look to you for your forgiveness,
[1462.22 --> 1464.96]  for your pardon, and for your love for us,
[1465.06 --> 1467.26]  which you have promised to us through Christ our Lord.
[1467.94 --> 1471.38]  So Lord, we come before you as children to a Heavenly Father,
[1473.22 --> 1477.50]  knowing that you forgive us, you welcome us into your embrace
[1477.50 --> 1480.70]  because of Christ your Son.
[1481.30 --> 1484.10]  So Lord, we thank you for that grace in which we stand
[1484.10 --> 1487.14]  and in which we can now continue to worship you.
[1487.30 --> 1488.78]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1489.60 --> 1490.80]  So friends, please stand.
[1491.90 --> 1494.94]  And we receive together God's assurance of pardon.
[1495.74 --> 1497.50]  So if you have confessed your sin,
[1497.50 --> 1501.62]  he has made provision to forgive us through Christ,
[1501.80 --> 1504.88]  who died in our place and who rose again from the dead.
[1505.46 --> 1507.78]  So from 1 Peter chapter 5,
[1507.78 --> 1513.26]  Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand,
[1513.74 --> 1515.76]  that he may lift you up in due time.
[1516.54 --> 1520.42]  Cast all of your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[1521.32 --> 1522.40]  So let's sing together.
[1522.40 --> 1524.22]  So let's sing together.
[1534.30 --> 1535.68]  So there's a question I want to have thanks here.
[1535.68 --> 1536.60]  Thank you.
[1536.66 --> 1539.10]  What do you have done now?
[1539.24 --> 1539.70]  Thank you.
[1539.84 --> 1541.36]  What do you have done now?
[1541.36 --> 1542.46]  Let's sing together.
[1542.68 --> 1544.26]  What do you have done now?
[1544.56 --> 1545.10]  This is the question?
[1545.10 --> 1545.90]  How do you have done now?
[1545.90 --> 1547.06]  So let's sing together.
[1547.10 --> 1547.64]  How do you have done now?
[1547.64 --> 1548.56]  What do you have done now?
[1548.56 --> 1549.96]  May I think we have done now?
[1549.96 --> 1550.62]  It's the norm?
[1550.62 --> 1570.88]  In the days that God has numbered, I was made to walk with fear.
[1570.88 --> 1581.84]  Yet I look for worldly treasures, and forsaken Him of Him.
[1582.34 --> 1592.80]  The God is open, my Redeemer, though I fall, His love is sure.
[1592.80 --> 1603.80]  For Christ has paid for every failing, I am His forevermore.
[1603.80 --> 1605.80]  Amen.
[1633.80 --> 1645.14]  The God is peace, the Lord of heaven, and the square in times of near.
[1645.64 --> 1655.80]  I know I came, will not be wasted, but the faith is not in me.
[1655.80 --> 1657.80]  Amen.
[1685.80 --> 1696.80]  The night is honor for this battle, strong enough to last the war.
[1696.80 --> 1706.80]  And we are still here, we'll deliver safely to their moment's home.
[1706.80 --> 1711.96]  The night is justice, the hang of God, the 돌byernidad, and the death.
[1711.96 --> 1712.12]  Amen.
[1712.12 --> 1717.80]  fossils sing an instrumental play as a Noam square.
[1717.80 --> 1721.80]  As theoris Annales, the rock and earth, thekami, daisy Mall, we are still here.
[1721.80 --> 1722.80]  Please remember, Ông sure.
[1722.80 --> 1723.80]  Please remember, walk when dijo hië.
[1723.80 --> 1727.80]  To those wanted out there to adjourn, ye you can come in.
[1727.80 --> 1728.02]  There's no �ordper.
[1728.02 --> 1728.88]  Be trusted in King.
[1728.88 --> 1734.88]  He was thể выивarner anybody whoู้ bir päin bessie,
[1734.88 --> 1741.88]  But it is not forevermore.
[1764.88 --> 1766.88]  Amen.
[1794.88 --> 1796.88]  Amen.
[1824.88 --> 1826.88]  Amen.
[1854.88 --> 1856.88]  Amen.
[1884.88 --> 1891.88]  I will not boast in anything.
[1891.88 --> 1897.88]  No gifts, no power, no wisdom.
[1897.88 --> 1905.88]  But I will boast in Jesus' life.
[1905.88 --> 1912.88]  His death and death's the better.
[1912.88 --> 1919.88]  But should I give your peace reward?
[1919.88 --> 1926.88]  I cannot give an answer.
[1926.88 --> 1933.88]  But this I know with all my heart
[1933.88 --> 1941.88]  His bones that make my ransom.
[1942.88 --> 1957.88]  I cannot give an answer.
[1957.88 --> 1964.88]  So the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday School classes.
[1964.88 --> 1979.88]  And as they go, I invite you to pull out the pew Bible in front of you and turn to the book of Romans.
[1979.88 --> 1980.88]  All right.
[1980.88 --> 1990.88]  So we are continuing on with our sermon series in the book of Romans.
[1990.88 --> 1995.88]  We are looking today at chapter 2, verses 12 to 16.
[1995.88 --> 1996.88]  Okay.
[1996.88 --> 1997.88]  Romans 2, 12 to 16.
[1997.88 --> 2009.88]  So over the last few weeks, Paul has been telling us that we can know God's love and care for us only as we humble ourselves before Him.
[2009.88 --> 2013.88]  Before our God and our Creator.
[2013.88 --> 2022.88]  And our passage this morning humbles us in a profound way because it clearly tells us that there will be a day of judgment.
[2022.88 --> 2029.88]  Where every person's thoughts and actions will be judged.
[2029.88 --> 2031.88]  And that is humbling for us.
[2031.88 --> 2032.88]  And so let's...
[2032.88 --> 2034.88]  I should turn there too.
[2034.88 --> 2035.88]  Okay.
[2035.88 --> 2037.88]  Romans.
[2037.88 --> 2038.88]  Romans.
[2038.88 --> 2039.88]  Romans.
[2039.88 --> 2040.88]  Romans.
[2040.88 --> 2050.88]  Romans chapter 2, verses 12 through 16.
[2050.88 --> 2057.88]  All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law.
[2057.88 --> 2062.88]  And all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
[2062.88 --> 2071.88]  For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
[2071.88 --> 2082.88]  Indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.
[2082.88 --> 2087.88]  Since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts.
[2087.88 --> 2094.88]  Their consciences also bearing witness in their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.
[2094.88 --> 2104.88]  This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ as my gospel declares.
[2104.88 --> 2107.88]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2107.88 --> 2114.88]  Would you join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word?
[2114.88 --> 2115.88]  Let's pray.
[2116.88 --> 2122.88]  Heavenly Father, once again, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[2122.88 --> 2133.88]  Will you grant us, Lord, as your sons and daughters, to be able to hear your voice, our Father's voice, even now.
[2133.88 --> 2135.88]  Not, Lord, my voice.
[2135.88 --> 2138.88]  Not any of our voices that speak from our own hearts.
[2138.88 --> 2142.88]  Lord, help us to hear what you're saying to us in your word.
[2142.88 --> 2149.88]  And would you give us, Lord, the grace to see you, the grace to know you, and the grace to love you.
[2149.88 --> 2152.88]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2152.88 --> 2158.88]  There is a TV show that I haven't personally gotten to watch very much.
[2158.88 --> 2160.88]  I know my brother is very into it.
[2160.88 --> 2163.88]  It's kind of more popular amongst the millennials.
[2163.88 --> 2164.88]  I'm right on the cusp.
[2164.88 --> 2165.88]  I'm more Gen X.
[2165.88 --> 2169.88]  But anyway, it's a show called Parks and Recreation.
[2169.88 --> 2171.88]  Has anybody seen this?
[2171.88 --> 2172.88]  A couple people.
[2172.88 --> 2173.88]  Okay. Oh, good.
[2173.88 --> 2174.88]  Not just the millennials either.
[2174.88 --> 2175.88]  Okay.
[2175.88 --> 2176.88]  Okay.
[2176.88 --> 2185.88]  So in Parks and Recreation, we're given a glimpse into kind of the life and the politics of a small rural town in Indiana.
[2185.88 --> 2193.88]  And in one of the most famous episodes, this town's sister city come to visit.
[2193.88 --> 2196.88]  And so they come from Venezuela.
[2196.88 --> 2203.88]  And in the episode, the Venezuelan officials sit in on this town hall style meeting.
[2203.88 --> 2213.88]  And he sees some of the conflicts in the complaints that the Indiana Parks and Recreation Department have to deal with.
[2213.88 --> 2231.88]  So in the meeting, these local residents stand up and just like they're belligerent and they yell and they shout at the parks, you know, officers, complain about things like frisbees flying through the parks and maybe knocking people's coffees out of their hand.
[2231.88 --> 2236.88]  Or they complain about the cleanliness of the washroom or people who don't pick up after their dogs.
[2236.88 --> 2237.88]  All these kinds of things.
[2237.88 --> 2243.88]  And the Venezuelan officials sitting there absolutely shocked by what he sees.
[2243.88 --> 2248.88]  And then, you know, the camera kind of zooms in on him in this interview style.
[2248.88 --> 2252.88]  He, the Venezuelan official, he says this to the camera.
[2252.88 --> 2254.88]  This is outrageous.
[2254.88 --> 2257.88]  Where are the armed men?
[2257.88 --> 2262.88]  If this happened in Venezuela, the armed men would have come and taken them to jail.
[2262.88 --> 2265.88]  You shout like that, they put you in jail right away.
[2265.88 --> 2267.88]  No trial, no nothing.
[2267.88 --> 2270.88]  You're stealing, right to jail.
[2270.88 --> 2273.88]  You're playing loud music, right to jail, right away.
[2273.88 --> 2276.88]  You're driving too fast, jail.
[2276.88 --> 2278.88]  Too slow, jail.
[2278.88 --> 2282.88]  You're charging too high prices for sweaters, right to jail.
[2282.88 --> 2287.88]  You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail.
[2287.88 --> 2290.88]  You overcook chicken, also jail.
[2290.88 --> 2297.88]  You make an appointment with a dentist and you don't show up, believe it or not, jail right away.
[2297.88 --> 2301.88]  We have the best patients in the world because of jail.
[2301.88 --> 2303.88]  It's a comedy.
[2303.88 --> 2306.88]  It's so funny, the actor, the way he delivers this.
[2306.88 --> 2311.88]  But in this iconic scene, you know, we hear the swift judgment of the Venezuelan government.
[2311.88 --> 2323.88]  And as we have been looking so far in the book of Romans, this last few weeks, it can kind of feel as though God is like this Venezuelan official.
[2323.88 --> 2325.88]  You worship idols?
[2325.88 --> 2326.88]  Jail.
[2326.88 --> 2328.88]  You dishonor your parents?
[2328.88 --> 2329.88]  Jail.
[2329.88 --> 2330.88]  You judge others?
[2330.88 --> 2331.88]  Jail.
[2331.88 --> 2332.88]  You're self-seeking?
[2332.88 --> 2333.88]  Jail.
[2333.88 --> 2335.88]  You try and keep the law, but you can't?
[2335.88 --> 2336.88]  Jail.
[2336.88 --> 2337.88]  Jail.
[2337.88 --> 2345.88]  You know, in these verses, we don't see the word jail, but we do read the word judgment.
[2345.88 --> 2350.88]  Paul is making the case that God's judgment is for all people.
[2350.88 --> 2351.88]  Right?
[2351.88 --> 2353.88]  It's for Jews and Gentiles.
[2353.88 --> 2355.88]  That's everybody.
[2355.88 --> 2360.88]  It's for the righteous and for the unrighteous.
[2360.88 --> 2367.88]  God will judge every single human being, you and me included.
[2367.88 --> 2370.88]  And God does not show favoritism.
[2370.88 --> 2375.88]  His judgments are absolutely fair.
[2375.88 --> 2390.88]  And in this week's passage, Paul continues on with this argument that he's been making, almost kind of anticipating what the hearers and the readers in the church of Rome, what they would give as pushback.
[2390.88 --> 2398.88]  If God judges impartially, what about the Jews who have the law?
[2398.88 --> 2402.88]  Or what about the Gentiles who don't have the law?
[2402.88 --> 2406.88]  Isn't there a difference that God should take into account there?
[2406.88 --> 2411.88]  Doesn't having the Mosaic law get you off the hook of God's judgment?
[2411.88 --> 2418.88]  Or doesn't not having the Mosaic law get you off the hook in God's judgment?
[2418.88 --> 2428.88]  And for many people, this is one of the most pressing questions that they have as far as those who without the law getting off the hook.
[2428.88 --> 2431.88]  Because how can God judge people who have never heard?
[2431.88 --> 2433.88]  Who have never heard of him?
[2433.88 --> 2441.88]  What about, you know, the girl on an island in the middle of the Pacific who has never even read the Bible?
[2441.88 --> 2446.88]  Who has never even heard that there is this God in Jesus Christ?
[2446.88 --> 2449.88]  Who has never heard the gospel?
[2449.88 --> 2452.88]  Well, Paul knows these questions.
[2452.88 --> 2454.88]  And he gives us an answer.
[2454.88 --> 2461.88]  And so what we're going to see this morning is that God's judgment is fair because he judges those with the law.
[2461.88 --> 2463.88]  And he judges those without the law.
[2463.88 --> 2466.88]  And he judges everybody through Jesus Christ.
[2466.88 --> 2469.88]  And so that's going to be our outline for this morning.
[2469.88 --> 2474.88]  So our first point is this, that God's judgment is fair.
[2474.88 --> 2477.88]  He judges those with the law.
[2477.88 --> 2481.88]  Okay, so let's see that as we look at verse 12.
[2481.88 --> 2484.88]  Verse 12 says,
[2484.88 --> 2489.88]  All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law.
[2489.88 --> 2490.88]  Okay, so that's the Gentiles.
[2490.88 --> 2495.88]  But then, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
[2495.88 --> 2497.88]  And that is the Jews.
[2497.88 --> 2501.88]  Okay, so here Paul, he's talking about these two groups of people.
[2501.88 --> 2507.88]  But first notice what these two groups are really everybody have in common.
[2507.88 --> 2512.88]  What they have that is the same is that they all sin.
[2512.88 --> 2515.88]  You see sin apart from the law or sin under the law.
[2515.88 --> 2517.88]  Either way, everyone is sinning.
[2517.88 --> 2529.88]  And because of our sin, there will be a day of God's wrath, it says in verse 5, where his righteous judgment will be revealed.
[2529.88 --> 2532.88]  Okay, so that's going to happen.
[2532.88 --> 2533.88]  We're all sinners.
[2533.88 --> 2534.88]  There's going to be judgment.
[2534.88 --> 2545.88]  The question is, how will that judgment play out in terms of, especially in the Jewish mind, the difference between them and the Gentiles?
[2545.88 --> 2552.88]  Because you see, the Jews, they thought that they had the upper hand because they had the law.
[2552.88 --> 2554.88]  Now, okay, so law.
[2554.88 --> 2559.88]  This is one of the major themes of the book of Romans, the law.
[2559.88 --> 2563.88]  And this is the first time it is introduced in our passage.
[2563.88 --> 2567.88]  And it's actually used like 10 times in these four or five verses.
[2567.88 --> 2574.88]  So when Paul talks about the law, as I'm sure you're aware in the book of Romans, he's not talking about the civic law.
[2574.88 --> 2577.88]  It's not talking about like traffic violations.
[2577.88 --> 2579.88]  He's talking about religious law.
[2579.88 --> 2588.88]  He's talking in particular about the first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch or the Torah.
[2588.88 --> 2591.88]  Okay, the law of Moses.
[2591.88 --> 2600.88]  And you know, certainly in the mind of Paul and of the Jews, the law gave the best information that anybody had ever had about God.
[2600.88 --> 2601.88]  Right?
[2601.88 --> 2609.88]  It gave the best teaching and pattern for how to obey God and how to know God and how to worship God.
[2609.88 --> 2610.88]  How to follow him.
[2610.88 --> 2613.88]  The law was precious.
[2613.88 --> 2616.88]  It told us how to be God's people.
[2616.88 --> 2619.88]  And if you're a Jew, you're waiting for Paul to talk about the law.
[2619.88 --> 2623.88]  The thing that God gave to the Jews only.
[2623.88 --> 2629.88]  The thing that they think gives you God's favor, shows you that you have God's favor.
[2629.88 --> 2640.88]  And Paul's response, knowing this pushback from his experience of preaching the gospel all around the Roman Empire, is to say to them, you know what?
[2640.88 --> 2643.88]  Actually, don't be too proud of that.
[2643.88 --> 2648.88]  Because you're going to be judged by the standards of the law.
[2648.88 --> 2651.88]  It's not having the law that matters.
[2651.88 --> 2653.88]  It's obeying it.
[2653.88 --> 2657.88]  It's living according to the law that counts.
[2657.88 --> 2660.88]  So verse 13, that's why he says this.
[2660.88 --> 2669.88]  For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
[2669.88 --> 2671.88]  It's kind of like this.
[2671.88 --> 2675.88]  You know a couple weeks ago how that big hurricane came through Florida?
[2675.88 --> 2676.88]  Right?
[2676.88 --> 2678.88]  Hurricane Milton is like three weeks ago.
[2678.88 --> 2685.88]  You know, and as we read the news, you know, one thing I noticed is that there were like over three million people who lost power.
[2685.88 --> 2697.88]  But, you know, we can imagine that out of those three plus million people who lost power, some of those people had generators.
[2697.88 --> 2699.88]  Does anybody have a generator in their house?
[2699.88 --> 2702.88]  It's a thing in like in some, okay.
[2702.88 --> 2704.88]  Some people have generators.
[2704.88 --> 2707.88]  I guess people who have lose power a lot.
[2707.88 --> 2711.88]  Anyway, so you have a generator in case the power goes out.
[2711.88 --> 2717.88]  So now imagine a guy who goes to the hardware store and he buys a generator.
[2717.88 --> 2719.88]  He brings it home.
[2719.88 --> 2728.88]  He puts it in the garage and he feels very proud and very secure that he has a generator, but it's still in the box.
[2728.88 --> 2732.88]  But, hey, you know, if the power goes out, I got a generator.
[2732.88 --> 2733.88]  Okay.
[2733.88 --> 2734.88]  Guess what?
[2734.88 --> 2739.88]  The hurricane came, the power goes out, and the generator was useless.
[2739.88 --> 2740.88]  Why was it useless?
[2740.88 --> 2743.88]  Well, because it was still in the box.
[2743.88 --> 2745.88]  He hadn't taken it out of the box.
[2745.88 --> 2747.88]  He hadn't bought fuel for the generator.
[2747.88 --> 2748.88]  He doesn't know how to use it.
[2748.88 --> 2749.88]  It's dark.
[2749.88 --> 2750.88]  He can't read the instructions.
[2750.88 --> 2752.88]  What's the connection?
[2752.88 --> 2754.88]  It's not those who have a generator.
[2754.88 --> 2761.88]  It's those who are prepared to use a generator who will be helped when the hurricane comes and the power goes out.
[2761.88 --> 2764.88]  And Paul is saying it's not those who have the law.
[2764.88 --> 2771.88]  It's those who do the law who will be helped, who will be declared righteous at the day of judgment.
[2771.88 --> 2778.88]  And so, in a sense, it's almost as if Israel's having the law actually makes their situation worse.
[2778.88 --> 2783.88]  Because to whom much is given, much will be expected.
[2783.88 --> 2788.88]  And those who have the law will be judged by the standards of the law.
[2788.88 --> 2794.88]  And so, again, what Paul is doing here is he's trying to even the playing field.
[2794.88 --> 2797.88]  Everyone will be judged fairly.
[2797.88 --> 2806.88]  You will be judged according to how you live in light of the law, the knowledge of God that you have been given.
[2806.88 --> 2809.88]  The Jews have been given a lot.
[2809.88 --> 2815.88]  And they will be held to account for the law that they have.
[2815.88 --> 2821.88]  But it's not just the Jews who will be judged.
[2821.88 --> 2828.88]  And so, our second point is that God also judges those without the law because he is fair.
[2828.88 --> 2830.88]  So, how does that work?
[2830.88 --> 2837.88]  Because on face value, it feels like those without the law are at a disadvantage.
[2837.88 --> 2838.88]  Right?
[2838.88 --> 2845.88]  How do they know what God wants of them if God hasn't made it clear to them what he wants?
[2845.88 --> 2846.88]  Right?
[2846.88 --> 2850.88]  I mean, how can God judge them fairly if they don't have the law?
[2850.88 --> 2859.88]  Is it like a parent, you know, punishing a child for disobedience when the child doesn't even know what they did wrong?
[2859.88 --> 2861.88]  I've done that.
[2861.88 --> 2865.88]  Is God like an unreasonable parent?
[2865.88 --> 2866.88]  No.
[2866.88 --> 2869.88]  Verses 14 and 15 tell us otherwise.
[2869.88 --> 2873.88]  God is just to judge those without the Mosaic Law.
[2873.88 --> 2874.88]  Why?
[2874.88 --> 2875.88]  How so?
[2875.88 --> 2879.88]  Because they have the law of God written on their hearts.
[2879.88 --> 2884.88]  Okay, so let's read again verses 14 and 15.
[2884.88 --> 2896.88]  Indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law, they are law for themselves even though they don't have the law.
[2896.88 --> 2912.88]  They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences, also bearing witness in their thoughts, sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending or justifying them.
[2912.88 --> 2916.88]  So here, Paul is talking about the Gentiles.
[2916.88 --> 2919.88]  And he's speaking really of the whole world.
[2919.88 --> 2922.88]  All those who don't have the Jewish law.
[2922.88 --> 2932.88]  And what he tells us about human beings across the board is that all of humanity has God's law written on their hearts.
[2932.88 --> 2935.88]  So this is what theologians call natural law.
[2935.88 --> 2936.88]  Okay, natural law.
[2936.88 --> 2941.88]  Humanity, in other words, has this innate knowledge that murder is wrong.
[2941.88 --> 2943.88]  That stealing is wrong.
[2943.88 --> 2945.88]  That adultery is wrong.
[2945.88 --> 2952.88]  God has given all of humanity this innate knowledge so that they would know what they should do and what they should not do.
[2952.88 --> 2961.88]  And you know what, this really kind of lines up with our experience living in this world.
[2961.88 --> 2962.88]  Right?
[2962.88 --> 2966.88]  People do bad, evil, stupid things all the time.
[2966.88 --> 2968.88]  Just drive.
[2968.88 --> 2974.88]  But people also often do pretty good things.
[2974.88 --> 2977.88]  People do pretty moral things.
[2977.88 --> 2982.88]  Every day we meet people who are truly kind.
[2982.88 --> 2985.88]  Truly caring people.
[2985.88 --> 2987.88]  They take care of their families.
[2987.88 --> 2988.88]  Right?
[2988.88 --> 2990.88]  They serve others.
[2990.88 --> 2992.88]  They are honest.
[2992.88 --> 2994.88]  They are generous.
[2994.88 --> 2996.88]  They're so great.
[2996.88 --> 3001.88]  And when it comes to our standing, our understanding of what the Bible says about sin,
[3001.88 --> 3006.88]  especially, you know, we have this reformed doctrine of total depravity.
[3006.88 --> 3009.88]  And sometimes we don't understand that correctly.
[3009.88 --> 3017.88]  Because total depravity, it doesn't mean that people are completely awful or that they are as bad as they could be.
[3017.88 --> 3019.88]  That's not what it means.
[3019.88 --> 3025.88]  What it means is that every part of what it means to be a human being has been tainted by sin.
[3025.88 --> 3034.88]  And so the doctrine of total depravity means total as in comprehensive, not total as in degree or like depth.
[3034.88 --> 3041.88]  So the Bible teaches that sin has touched every part of human lives.
[3041.88 --> 3047.88]  Our bodies, our minds, our emotions, our wills.
[3047.88 --> 3050.88]  All of it has been affected by sin.
[3050.88 --> 3053.88]  And as a result, we reject God.
[3053.88 --> 3054.88]  We worship idols.
[3054.88 --> 3055.88]  We do evil.
[3055.88 --> 3062.88]  But we also are kind and loving and generous.
[3062.88 --> 3066.88]  Because even though we are sinners, we are made in the image of God.
[3066.88 --> 3068.88]  We live in God's world.
[3068.88 --> 3070.88]  His grace is all around us.
[3070.88 --> 3074.88]  And he has put his law into our hearts.
[3074.88 --> 3076.88]  So it's both.
[3076.88 --> 3080.88]  We are sinners, but we also are made in the image of God.
[3080.88 --> 3084.60]  know and there are some really great people out there in the world but what
[3084.60 --> 3090.54]  Paul is saying is is that that doesn't mean they are spared from judgment right
[3090.54 --> 3095.94]  God has given them a sense of what the law requires and because of that fact
[3095.94 --> 3102.54]  they are liable to judgment and so God is not unfair for holding humanity to
[3102.54 --> 3106.80]  his standards because he has made it known to them they're not ignorant of
[3106.80 --> 3110.88]  his laws they will be judged for their failure to live according to the law
[3110.88 --> 3116.70]  that they do have and again you know there are many people who are not
[3116.70 --> 3123.56]  Christians who live fairly moral lives you know and you and I we might know
[3123.56 --> 3127.74]  people who are just you know they're they're kind they're great people even
[3127.74 --> 3133.32]  kinder than some Christians let's just be honest but that kindness does not
[3133.32 --> 3139.20]  absolve them from judgment it doesn't instead it makes them liable to
[3139.20 --> 3142.94]  judgment it shows that they know what is right and wrong they know what is good
[3142.94 --> 3148.62]  and evil and so some people have taken these verses to mean that God will save
[3148.62 --> 3154.68]  people apart from Jesus Christ right that if humanity just does good works if they
[3154.68 --> 3161.02]  are good and kind enough then they will be justified at the day of judgment but
[3161.02 --> 3165.82]  that is not what Paul is teaching just the opposite his point is that not only do
[3165.82 --> 3172.64]  Jews not do the law perfectly the Gentiles don't either he's saying that
[3172.64 --> 3178.30]  without the grace of Jesus on that day of judgment their own conscience will accuse
[3178.30 --> 3183.76]  them in other words they will stand before the judgment seat of God and know they
[3183.76 --> 3189.48]  are guilty they can't plead innocence or that they didn't know they will be
[3189.48 --> 3193.44]  convicted because they didn't know their conscience will bear witness against
[3193.44 --> 3197.88]  them it will actually testify against them because they know what is right and
[3197.88 --> 3202.08]  wrong so Paul's point here is not that there is some alternate route to
[3202.08 --> 3207.14]  salvation apart from Christ his point is that we are absolutely unable to keep the
[3207.14 --> 3214.08]  requirements of the law that are written on our hearts every single one of us the
[3214.08 --> 3221.76]  whole point is the Gentiles sin apart from the law the Jews in under the law we
[3221.76 --> 3227.88]  need Christ that is the point you can't fulfill the law and he tells us that we
[3227.88 --> 3233.28]  will be judged all people those who have the law those who do not have the law but
[3233.28 --> 3239.08]  they will be judged fairly according to the law that they have been given because
[3239.08 --> 3245.08]  God is not partial God does not pick favorites he is fair in his dealing with
[3245.08 --> 3253.00]  all of humanity and that brings us to our final point he judges everyone through
[3253.00 --> 3261.88]  Jesus Christ so let's look at our last verse in our passage verse 16 this will
[3261.88 --> 3268.90]  take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ as my
[3268.90 --> 3277.36]  gospel declares so okay verse 16 tells us that there will be a day of judgment when
[3277.36 --> 3286.88]  all of humanity will be judged God will judge he will call into account every thought
[3286.88 --> 3300.38]  every desire every motivation every action all that is seen all that is unseen because God knows
[3300.38 --> 3308.48]  your heart he knows how we haven't kept the law and this isn't meant therefore to make us try harder
[3308.48 --> 3316.70]  it's meant to make us see that we need help trying harder isn't going to do it we need intervention we
[3316.70 --> 3326.30]  need help we need Christ and you know what this the message okay the message of the disciples the
[3326.30 --> 3335.06]  message of the Apostles who went and preached Jesus we read about it in the book of Acts in the early
[3335.06 --> 3342.56]  church and so in their preaching they would focus on and they would really begin with the reality of this day
[3342.56 --> 3349.22]  judgment and that Jesus is the judge that's how they they spread the gospel and so I just want to show you one
[3349.22 --> 3359.96]  example of that so let's look at Acts chapter 10 verse 42 this is what I think Peter is speaking he Jesus
[3359.96 --> 3371.56]  commanded us to preach to the people and to testify what that he is the one whom God appointed as the judge of the living and the dead
[3371.56 --> 3379.16]  okay so we see here Peter and the apostles they're preaching the gospel right from the beginning of the church and they did not
[3379.16 --> 3395.16]  preach you are sinners and you need a savior this is what we are familiar with they preached instead you are sinners and you will be judged and you see this is what Jesus is teaching his
[3395.16 --> 3407.16]  apostles to preach okay this reality that there will be a day of judgment when God will judge people's hearts that Jesus will one day judge the living and the dead and that there is no escaping that day
[3407.16 --> 3421.16]  because he knows what's in your hearts and his judgment will be completely fair as we've said the question on that day will be have you kept God's law that he has given you
[3421.16 --> 3447.16]  we here we know a lot about what God requires of us have you kept it all at this point we should all be pretty sobered because the answer is no not one of us has kept the law
[3447.16 --> 3449.16]  the law
[3449.16 --> 3451.16]  the law
[3451.16 --> 3453.16]  I'm not talking about the law we don't know talking about the law we do know
[3453.16 --> 3457.16]  none of us will be able to stand before God and say
[3457.16 --> 3459.16]  yep
[3459.16 --> 3461.16]  I have not sinned
[3461.16 --> 3463.16]  right I have a perfect record I have kept the law
[3463.16 --> 3467.16]  none of us can do that and it's at this very point
[3467.16 --> 3471.16]  in our passage that somehow Paul says
[3471.16 --> 3473.16]  this is good news
[3473.16 --> 3475.16]  do you see that
[3475.16 --> 3481.16]  it's this very moment when he says as my gospel declares
[3481.16 --> 3483.16]  how is that possible
[3483.16 --> 3486.16]  how is it possible that Paul can say in verse 16
[3486.16 --> 3493.16]  this will take place on the day when God judges people's secret thoughts through Christ as my gospel declares
[3493.16 --> 3497.16]  how can he use that word good news
[3497.16 --> 3499.16]  good news
[3499.16 --> 3503.16]  now we are not the first people to ever ask that question
[3503.16 --> 3507.16]  those who wrote the Heidelberg Catechism wrote the exact same question
[3507.16 --> 3511.16]  so question in answer 52
[3511.16 --> 3517.16]  how does Christ return to judge the living and the dead comfort you
[3517.16 --> 3521.16]  how is this good news that we can take comfort in
[3521.16 --> 3523.16]  well here's the answer
[3523.16 --> 3539.16]  in all distress and persecution with uplifted head I confidently await the very judge who was already offered himself to the judgment of God in my place and removed the whole curse from me
[3539.16 --> 3551.16]  right the good news the comfort is that Jesus is that Jesus is the judge it's that Jesus who is our judge and who will judge on that day
[3551.16 --> 3553.16]  on that day
[3553.16 --> 3555.16]  it will be his righteousness
[3555.16 --> 3557.16]  it will be his good works
[3557.16 --> 3559.16]  his kindness his perfect life
[3559.16 --> 3561.16]  that we will be judged by
[3561.16 --> 3563.16]  not our own
[3563.16 --> 3567.16]  and that's why Paul is going here through such lengths
[3567.16 --> 3569.16]  we're like why will Paul just
[3569.16 --> 3571.16]  would he stop talking about judgment for once
[3571.16 --> 3573.16]  okay it's been like you know two chapters
[3573.16 --> 3577.16]  he is trying to prepare us
[3577.16 --> 3581.16]  beforehand for the reality of this day of judgment
[3581.16 --> 3583.16]  God
[3583.16 --> 3585.16]  out of his love for us
[3585.16 --> 3587.16]  tells us that there will be a day
[3587.16 --> 3589.16]  he wants us to know ahead of time
[3589.16 --> 3591.16]  because he loves us so that
[3591.16 --> 3593.16]  we now will acknowledge
[3593.16 --> 3595.16]  how completely inadequate
[3595.16 --> 3597.16]  any of our own goodness or kindness
[3597.16 --> 3599.16]  is
[3599.16 --> 3601.16]  to stand before a perfectly holy
[3601.16 --> 3603.16]  and just God
[3603.16 --> 3605.16]  and so that we will recognize
[3605.16 --> 3607.16]  that our only hope
[3607.16 --> 3609.16]  is in Jesus Christ
[3609.16 --> 3613.16]  that when we are united to Christ through faith
[3613.16 --> 3615.16]  we stand before the judgment throne of God
[3615.16 --> 3617.16]  not in our own righteousness
[3617.16 --> 3621.16]  but in Christ's perfect and spotless righteousness
[3621.16 --> 3623.16]  that is our hope
[3623.16 --> 3625.16]  that is our comfort that is the gospel
[3625.16 --> 3629.16]  that's the good news for all who will receive it
[3629.16 --> 3631.16]  so here's the question friends
[3631.16 --> 3635.16]  are you trusting in your own goodness
[3635.16 --> 3637.16]  in your own kindness
[3637.16 --> 3639.16]  I mean I know a lot of you are good people
[3639.16 --> 3641.16]  you're very kind
[3641.16 --> 3643.16]  you're very generous
[3643.16 --> 3645.16]  it's commendable
[3645.16 --> 3647.16]  is it enough to stand before the judgment seat of God
[3647.16 --> 3649.16]  or
[3649.16 --> 3651.16]  have you put your trust
[3651.16 --> 3653.16]  in Jesus Christ
[3653.16 --> 3655.16]  and do you stand before God
[3655.16 --> 3657.16]  his righteousness
[3657.16 --> 3659.16]  doing the good works that he has given you to do
[3659.16 --> 3661.16]  and that are covered by his forgiveness
[3661.16 --> 3663.16]  and covered by his righteousness
[3667.16 --> 3669.16]  so I want to as we end here
[3669.16 --> 3671.16]  I just want to read from Revelation
[3671.16 --> 3673.16]  chapter 7 verses 9 to 10
[3673.16 --> 3675.16]  read a couple verses
[3675.16 --> 3677.16]  I want to invite you to
[3677.16 --> 3679.16]  you can close your eyes if you want
[3679.16 --> 3681.16]  if you just want to listen
[3681.16 --> 3683.16]  with your eyes closed but either way
[3683.16 --> 3685.16]  before I read I want to give you a moment
[3685.16 --> 3689.16]  to respond to God's word in our passage today
[3689.16 --> 3691.16]  so let me read this
[3691.16 --> 3695.16]  and then I'll give you a time of silent prayer
[3695.16 --> 3699.16]  after this I looked
[3699.16 --> 3703.16]  and there before me was a great multitude
[3703.16 --> 3705.16]  that no one could count
[3705.16 --> 3709.16]  from every nation, tribe, people and language
[3709.16 --> 3711.16]  standing before the throne
[3711.16 --> 3713.16]  and before the lamb
[3713.16 --> 3715.16]  they were wearing white robes
[3715.16 --> 3719.16]  and were holding palm branches in their hands
[3719.16 --> 3721.16]  and they cried out with a loud voice
[3721.16 --> 3723.16]  salvation
[3723.16 --> 3725.16]  belongs to our God
[3725.16 --> 3727.16]  who sits on the throne
[3727.16 --> 3729.16]  and to the lamb
[3729.16 --> 3751.16]  heavenly father we thank you for
[3751.16 --> 3753.16]  the good news
[3753.16 --> 3759.90]  the good news. We thank you for revealing the last day of judgment to us and providing
[3759.90 --> 3768.88]  in such a powerful and loving way for that day in the judge, Jesus Christ, whom you have appointed.
[3769.60 --> 3776.48]  Help us, Lord, to rely on Jesus alone, on his grace alone, on his mercy alone, and on the
[3776.48 --> 3784.68]  forgiveness of our sins. And may that be our only hope, our assurance, as we live our lives now for
[3784.68 --> 3788.62]  you. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3791.68 --> 3797.26]  Let's all stand and let's sing, in response to God's mercy to us, our next song.
[3806.48 --> 3808.48]  Amen.
[3821.68 --> 3823.68]  Amen.
[3823.68 --> 3824.68]  Amen.
[3853.68 --> 3854.68]  Amen.

[3973.68 --> 3974.68]  Amen.
[4003.68 --> 4005.68]  Amen.
[4033.68 --> 4045.68]  Blessed are the world resurrected, as we will be, let be of.
[4045.68 --> 4046.68]  Amen.
[4046.68 --> 4047.68]  Amen.
[4047.68 --> 4048.68]  Amen.
[4048.68 --> 4049.68]  Amen.

[4120.68 --> 4123.68]  I've never done this before.
[4143.68 --> 4149.68]  I face the ground below.
[4149.68 --> 4156.68]  You are a peaceful wonder.
[4156.68 --> 4163.68]  You and me will sing before me.
[4163.68 --> 4173.68]  In the dark where the light is gone,
[4173.68 --> 4179.68]  the rays and rain are all over me.
[4179.68 --> 4187.68]  And right when I eat, I'll touch the ground.
[4187.68 --> 4193.68]  Deep city.
[4193.68 --> 4199.68]  You are a sanctuary,
[4199.68 --> 4206.68]  a kind place where I belong.
[4206.68 --> 4212.68]  You are a peaceful wonder.
[4212.68 --> 4219.68]  You will bring me, save me home.
[4219.68 --> 4225.68]  You are a sanctuary,
[4225.68 --> 4232.68]  a kind place where I belong.
[4232.68 --> 4238.68]  You are a peaceful wonder.
[4238.68 --> 4245.68]  You will bring me, save me home.
[4245.68 --> 4251.68]  In the morning, in the night, in the darkness, in the light.
[4251.68 --> 4258.68]  You alone will be my God, for you are with me.
[4258.68 --> 4264.68]  In the morning, in the night, in the darkness, in the light.
[4264.68 --> 4274.68]  You alone will be my God, for you are with me.

[4316.68 --> 4331.68]  I guess we can always cut that out of the livestream, if we need to.
[4331.68 --> 4340.68]  All right, well let's turn to the Lord in our hearts in a prayer.
[4340.68 --> 4344.68]  A prayer for the world and our community.
[4344.68 --> 4350.68]  Gracious God and Father, Lord, we are grateful this morning for your call in our lives.
[4350.68 --> 4354.68]  You desire to people for your own possession.
[4354.68 --> 4357.68]  And Lord, we are privileged to be a part.
[4357.68 --> 4359.68]  You have redeemed us by your blood.
[4359.68 --> 4363.68]  You have, through a costly payment, and you have made us your children.
[4363.68 --> 4368.68]  As a good Father, you care for us and you teach us through your word.
[4368.68 --> 4372.68]  And you command us to live.
[4372.68 --> 4377.68]  You command us as well, Lord, and you invite us, Lord, to rejoice always.
[4377.68 --> 4382.68]  You invite us to pray without ceasing, to give thanks in all circumstances.
[4382.68 --> 4386.68]  For this is your will for us, Father.
[4386.68 --> 4391.68]  And so we do pray to you in the name of Jesus, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
[4391.68 --> 4394.68]  whoever lives to intercede for us.
[4394.68 --> 4405.68]  So, Father, we praise and bless you and we adore you because you are our God, Lord, who created all things.
[4405.68 --> 4413.68]  You created all things, Lord, first and foremost, in a way that is good and with your blessing upon it.
[4413.68 --> 4421.68]  And Jesus, you are the redeemer who has committed to take all that has been broken and to put it right again.
[4421.68 --> 4429.68]  Our relationship with you, our relationship with ourselves, with others in this world that you've made.
[4429.68 --> 4436.68]  And until that day, Lord, we ask for peace amid the chaos of our rebellious world.
[4436.68 --> 4445.68]  Father, please grant those who are in places of political power that they might serve at your behest.
[4445.68 --> 4450.68]  That they might serve according to your will and with mercy and with justice.
[4450.68 --> 4460.68]  And, Lord, as we look to our neighbors to the south, the upcoming U.S. presidential election,
[4460.68 --> 4466.68]  we pray on their behalf and really for the sake of the world, that though many feel divided from one another,
[4466.68 --> 4469.68]  Lord, we pray that peace would reign.
[4469.68 --> 4479.68]  We ask that it be your will or that your will be done, Lord, knowing that the heart of the king is like a stream of water in the hands of the Lord.
[4479.68 --> 4481.68]  And he directs it wherever he chooses.
[4481.68 --> 4493.68]  Father, we continue to ask that you would give this church, Ladner CRC, Lord, in your church around the world, the comfort of knowing that you are God.
[4493.68 --> 4506.68]  Give us eyes to see that in all areas of our lives that your throne is permanent and we are your children, that we dwell safely and securely in you.
[4506.68 --> 4512.68]  Father, we pray for the work of world renew as they seek to alleviate hunger in many parts of the world.
[4512.68 --> 4527.68]  Lord, would you provide the ongoing needs for this ministry to continue as we, your church, seek to be the hands and the feet of Christ, who cares for the poor and the needy.
[4527.68 --> 4544.68]  Lord, would the message also of the hope of the gospel accompany their work wherever it goes so that as people see their needs being met, that they would know a savior who also can meet their spiritual needs.
[4544.68 --> 4551.68]  Lord, we pray also, therefore, for your glory, the expansion of your church around the world.
[4551.68 --> 4555.68]  Lord, we also pray for individuals in our church.
[4555.68 --> 4558.68]  We thank you for bringing Henny home from the hospital.
[4558.68 --> 4563.68]  We ask that you would continue to heal her as she recovers from her hip surgery.
[4563.68 --> 4569.68]  We continue to pray for little Maya as she settles into a new life with Jeff and Ashley.
[4569.68 --> 4578.68]  Lord, bless their family and help us as a church to support them as they raise up Maya in the fear and admonition of the Lord.
[4578.68 --> 4588.68]  We pray for grace who is still in the hospital, Lord, waiting for a permanent place in a care home.
[4588.68 --> 4599.68]  We pray for, Lord, others in our church who are sick, who struggle with pain, struggle with anxiety, who struggle with loneliness.
[4599.68 --> 4602.68]  Lord, that you would meet all their needs.
[4602.68 --> 4609.68]  Lord, yourself, most importantly, but also, Lord, meet their needs through us, your church, as we surround them with your loving care.
[4609.68 --> 4614.68]  And Father, we thank you for the faith that your spirit has planted in our hearts.
[4614.68 --> 4629.68]  We thank you for the love we experience together in worship, for the ultimate hope of heaven that we have in you, for your words of truth, for the gospel that has come to us in your son, and for your spirit at work in our lives and in the world.
[4629.68 --> 4633.68]  Lord, and we pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4633.68 --> 4640.68]  So let's stand and we will go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4640.68 --> 4646.68]  If you are in the membership class, we have another last session today in the council room.
[4646.68 --> 4648.68]  Next Sunday will be membership Sunday.
[4648.68 --> 4653.68]  So hopefully you'll see some of these new members up here to be received as members.
[4653.68 --> 4658.68]  And join us for a time of coffee in the fellowship hall right after the service.
[4658.68 --> 4667.68]  Okay, now I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the grace, the good word of your heavenly Father.
[4667.68 --> 4676.68]  Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4676.68 --> 4686.68]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages, now and forevermore.
[4686.68 --> 4687.68]  Amen.
[4687.68 --> 4692.68]  So remain standing and we'll sing a final song before we depart.
[4692.68 --> 4697.68]  Take myself here in the apostles for one by three escuela.
[4697.68 --> 4701.68]  Thanks a few cand Nagel.
[4701.68 --> 4702.68]  Come and stay healthy very quickly.
[4702.68 --> 4708.68]  God, I beg and pray.
[4708.68 --> 4715.68]  Die three years are connected, oh notno.

[4765.38 --> 4771.04]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on fire.
[4771.04 --> 4777.82]  Our name is Him, He is exalted, forever exalted.
[4777.82 --> 4785.04]  And I will praise His name.
[4786.80 --> 4794.04]  He is the Lord, forever his truth shall reign.
[4794.04 --> 4803.04]  Heaven and earth, your justice is all in vain.
[4803.04 --> 4809.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on fire.
