[299.48 → 301.48] Beloved Church, good morning.
[301.48 → 302.48] Good morning.
[302.48 → 308.48] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I want to welcome you to worship on this Lord's Day.
[308.48 → 315.48] And especially on this long weekend when I know many people are away, and they're dusting off their campers.
[315.48 → 317.48] I'm glad you're here.
[317.48 → 319.48] I'm glad to be here with you.
[319.48 → 321.48] So my name is Jason True.
[321.48 → 328.48] I'll be leading us in our worship this morning, and we have Paul Kemp on the piano and some of our singers and musicians as well.
[328.48 → 332.48] And if you are visiting with us today, I especially want to welcome you.
[332.48 → 335.48] And I'm so glad that you've joined us today for worship.
[335.48 → 344.48] And so we are gathered together because we believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true.
[344.48 → 358.48] And so we have come together also clinging to the promises of Jesus that where he says wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am with them.
[358.48 → 361.48] So we believe that God is with us.
[361.48 → 364.48] He is with us here, especially by the Holy Spirit.
[364.48 → 372.48] Today is the day of Pentecost, Pentecost Sunday, when we celebrate that God did pour out the Holy Spirit upon the church.
[372.48 → 377.48] And so that's something that we'll be considering together this morning.
[377.48 → 386.48] And so let's begin our time of worship by listening to God's voice as he speaks to us, as he calls us to worship him.
[386.48 → 391.48] And we'll have our call to worship here from Psalm 50.
[391.48 → 393.48] And where is the double arrow?
[393.48 → 396.48] I invite you to read it responsibly with me.
[396.48 → 406.48] The mighty one, God, the Lord speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
[406.48 → 411.48] From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
[411.48 → 414.48] Our God comes and will not be silent.
[414.48 → 420.48] A fire devours before him and around him the tempest rages.
[420.48 → 424.48] Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving.
[424.48 → 427.48] Call upon him in the day of trouble.
[427.48 → 432.48] The Lord says, call on me in the day of trouble.
[432.48 → 436.48] I will deliver you, and you will honour me.
[436.48 → 445.48] So this morning we just finished our cross-training class on the history of the early church.
[445.48 → 447.48] And so that was on my mind this week.
[447.48 → 452.48] And I discovered a prayer that comes from the early church, comes from the fourth century.
[452.48 → 455.48] And I thought we would make it our prayer this morning.
[455.48 → 463.48] So we are praying with our ancestors in the faith from many, many centuries ago as we say this prayer.
[463.48 → 468.48] So let's join our hearts in prayer to God together.
[468.48 → 473.48] Oh God, the God of spirits and of all flesh.
[473.48 → 479.48] You are beyond compare and stand in need of nothing.
[479.48 → 483.48] You who have given the sun to rule over the day,
[483.48 → 486.48] and the moon and the stars to rule over the night.
[486.48 → 492.48] Look down on us with gracious eyes and receive our morning thanksgivings.
[492.48 → 495.48] And have mercy on us.
[495.48 → 498.48] We have not lifted our hands to a strange God.
[498.48 → 504.48] For there is not among us any God but you, the eternal God, who are without end.
[504.48 → 508.48] You have given us our being through Christ.
[508.48 → 511.48] And given us our well-being through him.
[511.48 → 515.48] Through him also give us eternal life.
[515.48 → 521.48] To him be glory and honour and worship with you in the Holy Spirit, now and forever.
[521.48 → 522.48] Amen.
[522.48 → 534.48] So let's all stand and let's hear this greeting where God calls us, and he welcomes us into his presence this morning as we worship him.
[534.48 → 537.48] And here's God's greeting to us.
[537.48 → 539.48] The spirit and the bride say come.
[539.48 → 542.48] And let the one who hears say come.
[542.48 → 544.48] Let the one who is thirsty come.
[544.48 → 549.48] And let the one who wishes take the gift of the water of life.
[549.48 → 556.48] So let's turn and let's greet one another as the Lord has greeted us this morning.
[556.48 → 566.48] to honour.
[566.48 → 568.48] The spirit and the tram our righteousness sources are theетрised fermions where the one who sets out the Firewood victor and Gained the creamer,
[568.48 → 572.48] who name it, and Kronecker can appear all through the trading arm, and the Ark.

[604.60 → 607.06] Let's raise our voices to him today.

[1496.48 → 1499.48] So our first scripture reading this morning is from the book of Ezekiel
[1499.48 → 1504.48] So if you want to grab a pew Bible what you do is you open the middle you'll see psalm
[1504.48 → 1506.48] The psalm
[1506.48 → 1508.48] Psalms, and then you turn right
[1508.48 → 1510.48] And you might hit Isaiah
[1510.48 → 1512.48] Then you might hit Jeremiah
[1512.48 → 1514.48] And then you come to Ezekiel
[1520.48 → 1522.48] That is on page 648
[1522.48 → 1524.48] Page 648
[1524.48 → 1526.48] Page 648
[1526.48 → 1528.48] Ezekiel
[1528.48 → 1530.48] Chapter 37
[1530.48 → 1532.48] Verses 1-14
[1532.48 → 1536.48] The Spirit of God giving life to the dry bones of Israel
[1536.48 → 1540.48] So I'll read it for us
[1540.48 → 1544.48] The hand of the Lord was upon me
[1544.48 → 1548.48] And he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord
[1548.48 → 1550.48] And set me in the middle of a valley
[1550.48 → 1552.48] It was full of bones
[1552.48 → 1555.48] He led me back and forth among them
[1555.48 → 1558.48] And I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley
[1558.48 → 1560.48] Bones that were very dry
[1560.48 → 1562.48] He asked me
[1562.48 → 1564.48] Son of man can these bones live
[1564.48 → 1566.48] I said
[1566.48 → 1568.48] O sovereign Lord
[1568.48 → 1570.48] You alone know
[1570.48 → 1571.48] Then he said to me
[1571.48 → 1573.48] Prophesy to these bones
[1573.48 → 1574.48] And say to them
[1574.48 → 1575.48] Dry bones
[1575.48 → 1577.48] Hear the word of the Lord
[1577.48 → 1581.48] This is what the sovereign Lord says to these dry bones
[1581.48 → 1583.48] I will make breath enter you
[1583.48 → 1585.48] And you will come to life
[1585.48 → 1587.48] I will attach tendons to you
[1587.48 → 1589.48] And make flesh come upon you
[1589.48 → 1591.48] And cover you with skin
[1591.48 → 1593.48] I will put breath in you
[1593.48 → 1595.48] And you will come to life
[1595.48 → 1596.48] Then you will know
[1596.48 → 1598.48] That I am the Lord
[1598.48 → 1599.48] So I prophesied
[1599.48 → 1601.48] As I was commanded
[1601.48 → 1603.48] And as I was prophesying
[1603.48 → 1604.48] There was a noise
[1604.48 → 1605.48] A rattling sound
[1605.48 → 1607.48] And the bones came together
[1607.48 → 1609.48] Bone to bone
[1609.48 → 1612.48] I looked and tendons and flesh appeared on them
[1612.48 → 1613.48] And skin covered them
[1613.48 → 1615.48] But there was no breath in them
[1615.48 → 1616.48] Then he said to me
[1616.48 → 1618.48] Prophesy to the breath
[1618.48 → 1620.48] Prophesy son of man
[1620.48 → 1621.48] And say to it
[1621.48 → 1622.48] This is what the sovereign Lord says
[1622.48 → 1624.48] Come from the four winds
[1624.48 → 1625.48] O breath
[1625.48 → 1626.48] And breathe into these slain
[1626.48 → 1628.48] That they may live
[1628.48 → 1630.48] So I prophesied
[1630.48 → 1631.48] As he commanded
[1631.48 → 1632.48] As he commanded me
[1632.48 → 1634.48] And breath entered them
[1634.48 → 1636.48] They came to life
[1636.48 → 1637.48] And stood up on their feet
[1637.48 → 1639.48] A vast army
[1639.48 → 1640.48] Then he said to me
[1640.48 → 1641.48] Son of man
[1641.48 → 1643.48] These bones are the whole house of Israel
[1643.48 → 1645.48] These bones are the whole house of Israel
[1645.48 → 1646.48] They say
[1646.48 → 1647.48] They say
[1647.48 → 1648.48] Our bones are dried up
[1648.48 → 1649.48] And our hope is gone
[1649.48 → 1650.48] And we are cut off
[1650.48 → 1652.48] Therefore prophesy
[1652.48 → 1653.48] And say to them
[1653.48 → 1655.48] This is what the sovereign Lord says
[1655.48 → 1656.48] O my people
[1656.48 → 1658.48] I am going to open your graves
[1658.48 → 1659.48] And bring you up from them
[1659.48 → 1662.48] I will bring you back to the land of Israel
[1662.48 → 1664.48] Then you my people will know
[1664.48 → 1666.48] That I am the Lord
[1666.48 → 1667.48] When I open your graves
[1667.48 → 1668.48] And bring you up from them
[1668.48 → 1670.48] I will put my spirit in you
[1670.48 → 1671.48] And you will live
[1671.48 → 1673.48] And I will settle you in your own land
[1673.48 → 1674.48] Then you will know
[1674.48 → 1676.48] That I the Lord have spoken
[1676.48 → 1678.48] And I have done it
[1678.48 → 1679.48] Declares the Lord
[1679.48 → 1681.48] This is the word of the Lord
[1685.48 → 1688.48] So we now come to our time of confession
[1688.48 → 1690.48] Confession
[1690.48 → 1691.48] It was
[1691.48 → 1692.48] I forget who
[1692.48 → 1693.48] Someone who said
[1693.48 → 1696.48] That Christianity is all about this
[1696.48 → 1697.48] It is about
[1697.48 → 1698.48] Taking one look
[1698.48 → 1700.48] At your own sin
[1700.48 → 1703.48] But then taking ten looks
[1703.48 → 1704.48] At your saviour
[1704.48 → 1706.48] And so that is what we do
[1706.48 → 1707.48] When we come to confession
[1707.48 → 1708.48] We acknowledge our sin
[1708.48 → 1709.48] The reality of sin
[1709.48 → 1711.48] The pervasive evil of sin
[1711.48 → 1712.48] In our hearts and in the world
[1712.48 → 1714.48] But we don't dwell there
[1714.48 → 1715.48] We then look to our saviour
[1715.48 → 1717.48] Who died for us
[1717.48 → 1720.48] That he could offer us forgiveness
[1720.48 → 1721.48] And make us children of God
[1721.48 → 1722.48] Through the spirit
[1722.48 → 1723.48] So that is what we do now
[1723.48 → 1724.48] We will look at our sin
[1724.48 → 1727.48] But we will look mostly to Jesus
[1727.48 → 1730.48] So I will lead us in this prayer
[1730.48 → 1732.48] Then I will give just a moment for you
[1732.48 → 1734.48] To silently bring anything
[1734.48 → 1735.48] That the spirit puts on your hearts
[1735.48 → 1737.48] Before the Lord in confession
[1737.48 → 1741.48] Before we then hear God's assurance of mercy
[1741.48 → 1743.48] So please join me in a prayer of confession
[1743.48 → 1744.48] As I pray for us
[1744.48 → 1745.48] And pray for us
[1747.48 → 1748.48] Heavenly Father
[1748.48 → 1750.48] Thank you for sending your son
[1750.48 → 1752.48] Who became poor
[1752.48 → 1754.48] That we might become rich
[1754.48 → 1756.48] Who took the form of a servant
[1756.48 → 1760.48] But who now reigns as king
[1760.48 → 1763.48] Our exalted Lord Jesus
[1763.48 → 1765.48] You poured out your Holy Spirit upon the church
[1765.48 → 1767.48] To fill us with new life
[1767.48 → 1768.48] New life
[1768.48 → 1770.48] And power and love
[1770.48 → 1772.48] With which we might serve you
[1772.48 → 1775.48] We confess the times
[1775.48 → 1777.48] We have resisted
[1777.48 → 1779.48] And grieved your spirit
[1779.48 → 1783.48] Forgive our closed minds
[1783.48 → 1785.48] When we block out your truth
[1785.48 → 1786.48] And wisdom
[1788.48 → 1790.48] Forgive our closed eyes
[1790.48 → 1792.48] When we blind ourselves
[1792.48 → 1794.48] To the needs in the world
[1795.48 → 1797.48] Forgive our closed hands
[1797.48 → 1799.48] When we clutch the gifts
[1799.48 → 1800.48] And the wealth
[1800.48 → 1802.48] You have graciously given us
[1802.48 → 1804.48] Too closely
[1805.48 → 1807.48] Forgive our closed hearts
[1807.48 → 1809.48] When we limit our affections
[1809.48 → 1811.48] Only to ourselves
[1811.48 → 1812.48] And our own
[1813.48 → 1815.48] Lord have mercy on us
[1815.48 → 1816.48] And forgive us all our sins
[1817.48 → 1819.48] Open our hearts to your spirit
[1819.48 → 1821.48] That we may open our lives
[1821.48 → 1822.48] To reveal your glory
[1822.48 → 1824.48] And share in the joy
[1824.48 → 1825.48] Of your mission of love
[1825.48 → 1826.48] To the world
[1827.48 → 1828.48] Let's take a time now
[1828.48 → 1829.48] Let's take a time now
[1829.48 → 1831.48] To silently confess our sins to God
[1858.48 → 1879.48] Lord, even as we look to our sin
[1879.48 → 1882.48] Help us to look to the love
[1882.48 → 1884.48] That you have for us
[1884.48 → 1885.48] That you accept us
[1885.48 → 1886.48] Not because of us
[1886.48 → 1888.48] But through your son
[1889.48 → 1891.48] Lord, we thank you for your mercy to us
[1891.48 → 1892.48] And help us
[1892.48 → 1894.48] To live by the spirit
[1894.48 → 1895.48] And follow you
[1896.48 → 1897.48] And according to your word
[1897.48 → 1898.48] We pray in Jesus' name
[1898.48 → 1899.48] Amen
[1900.48 → 1901.48] So now we hear these words
[1901.48 → 1902.48] Of God's forgiveness
[1902.48 → 1904.48] And his assurance to us
[1904.48 → 1905.48] That we see here
[1905.48 → 1907.48] In John 14
[1908.48 → 1909.48] It's a well-known passage
[1909.48 → 1912.48] About what Jesus talks about
[1912.48 → 1913.48] The comforter
[1913.48 → 1914.48] Who will come
[1914.48 → 1915.48] The spirit
[1915.48 → 1916.48] So he says this
[1916.48 → 1918.48] And I will ask the Father
[1918.48 → 1919.48] Jesus says
[1919.48 → 1920.48] And he will give you
[1920.48 → 1921.48] Another advocate
[1921.48 → 1922.48] To help you
[1922.48 → 1923.48] And be with you forever
[1923.48 → 1924.48] The spirit of truth
[1924.48 → 1926.48] The world cannot accept him
[1926.48 → 1928.48] Because neither sees him
[1928.48 → 1929.48] Nor knows him
[1929.48 → 1930.48] But you know him
[1930.48 → 1932.48] For he lives with you
[1932.48 → 1934.48] And will be in you
[1934.48 → 1936.48] So brothers and sisters
[1936.48 → 1938.48] Know that you are forgiven
[1938.48 → 1939.48] And be at peace
[1939.48 → 1940.48] Amen
[1940.48 → 1944.48] So let's stand one more time
[1944.48 → 1947.48] And we will sing our next song
[1947.48 → 1948.48] How deep the Father
[1948.48 → 1949.48] The Father
[1949.48 → 1958.48] How deep the Father's love for us
[1958.48 → 1971.48] How deep the Father's love for us
[1971.48 → 1975.48] How vast beyond all measure
[1975.48 → 1979.48] That he should give his only Son
[1979.48 → 1984.38] That he should give his only Son
[1984.38 → 1989.10] To make a wretch his treasure
[1989.10 → 1995.56] How great the pain of searing loss
[1995.56 → 2001.00] The Father turns his face away
[2001.00 → 2006.66] As wounds which mar the chosen one
[2006.66 → 2011.40] Till there be sounds to glory
[2011.40 → 2028.68] Behold the man upon our cross
[2028.68 → 2033.58] My sin upon his shoulders
[2033.58 → 2039.74] Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[2039.74 → 2044.58] Fall out among the scoffers
[2045.14 → 2050.90] It was my sin that held him there
[2050.90 → 2055.58] Until it was accomplished
[2055.58 → 2061.58] His dying breath has brought me life
[2061.58 → 2066.86] My heart that it is finished
[2066.86 → 2083.02] I will not boast in anything
[2083.02 → 2088.68] No wisdom, no power, no wisdom
[2088.68 → 2094.02] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[2094.80 → 2099.30] His death and resurrection
[2099.30 → 2105.24] Why should I gain from his reward
[2105.24 → 2110.86] I cannot give an answer
[2110.86 → 2117.14] But this I know with all my heart
[2117.14 → 2121.96] In his wounds I'll gain my lesson
[2121.96 → 2133.62] Thank you.
[2133.70 → 2134.24] You may be seated.
[2134.24 → 2145.68] All right.
[2145.74 → 2146.72] The children are dismissed
[2146.72 → 2148.26] To go to their Sunday school classes
[2148.26 → 2163.98] So today as I've said
[2163.98 → 2165.44] Is Pentecost Sunday
[2165.44 → 2170.26] And Pentecost is said to be
[2170.26 → 2172.94] The birthday of the church
[2172.94 → 2174.14] Happy birthday
[2174.14 → 2175.82] We're the church, right?
[2176.12 → 2178.64] So we were born on this Pentecost day
[2178.64 → 2180.40] Many, many years ago
[2180.40 → 2183.00] And it's the birthday of the church
[2183.00 → 2185.34] Because this is the day
[2185.34 → 2186.92] That Jesus sent the Holy Spirit
[2186.92 → 2188.88] To be with his church
[2188.88 → 2191.70] To empower his church
[2191.70 → 2194.78] For the ministry that Jesus had given them
[2194.78 → 2197.14] To make disciples of all the nations
[2197.14 → 2199.32] And so today we're going to be talking
[2199.32 → 2200.64] About the Holy Spirit
[2200.64 → 2201.86] We're going to talk about
[2201.86 → 2203.20] Who the Holy Spirit is
[2203.20 → 2205.60] And what he does in the world
[2205.60 → 2207.22] And in our own lives
[2207.22 → 2208.46] And we're going to do that
[2208.46 → 2209.28] By looking today
[2209.28 → 2210.90] At the story of Pentecost
[2210.90 → 2212.98] From Acts chapter 2
[2212.98 → 2214.90] So what I'd like to do is first
[2214.90 → 2216.34] I'm just going to read one verse
[2216.34 → 2218.02] From Luke 24
[2218.02 → 2219.18] If you want to follow along
[2219.18 → 2219.82] In your Bibles
[2219.82 → 2223.56] You can turn back to Luke chapter 24
[2223.56 → 2226.32] We'll read verse 49
[2226.32 → 2228.36] We read this passage last week
[2228.36 → 2232.16] Luke 24
[2232.16 → 2237.42] Verse 49
[2237.42 → 2238.78] That is on page 788
[2238.78 → 2239.90] Of your Bible
[2239.90 → 2245.26] So Luke 24
[2245.26 → 2246.00] Verse 49
[2246.00 → 2248.32] This is right before Jesus ascends
[2248.32 → 2249.78] And he says
[2249.78 → 2252.80] I am going to send you
[2252.80 → 2254.54] What my Father has promised
[2254.54 → 2257.00] But stay in the city
[2257.00 → 2259.54] Until you have been clothed with power
[2259.54 → 2260.94] From on high
[2260.94 → 2262.20] Okay
[2262.20 → 2263.36] Then he ascends into heaven
[2263.36 → 2264.86] The disciples are to wait
[2264.86 → 2266.64] Until they are clothed with power
[2266.64 → 2268.22] So now let's turn
[2268.22 → 2270.70] Forward to Acts chapter 2
[2270.70 → 2274.36] And the same author who wrote Luke
[2274.36 → 2275.68] Also wrote the book of Acts
[2275.68 → 2278.60] And we will now read verses 1-13
[2278.60 → 2282.40] Just on page 8-10
[2282.40 → 2286.44] So Acts chapter 2 verses 1-13
[2286.44 → 2288.78] When the day of Pentecost came
[2288.78 → 2291.42] They were all together in one place
[2291.42 → 2295.08] Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind
[2295.08 → 2296.68] Came from heaven
[2296.68 → 2299.16] And filled the whole house where they were sitting
[2299.16 → 2302.58] They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire
[2302.58 → 2305.18] That separated and came to rest on each of them
[2305.18 → 2307.70] All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
[2307.70 → 2309.98] And began to speak in other tongues
[2309.98 → 2311.78] As the Spirit enabled them
[2311.78 → 2314.16] Now there were staying in Jerusalem
[2314.16 → 2316.88] God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven
[2316.88 → 2319.00] When they heard this sound
[2319.00 → 2321.84] A crowd came together in bewilderment
[2321.84 → 2324.38] Because each one heard them speaking
[2324.38 → 2325.98] In his own language
[2325.98 → 2327.78] Utterly amazed
[2327.78 → 2329.00] They asked
[2329.00 → 2332.18] Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
[2332.18 → 2335.54] Then how is it that each of us
[2335.54 → 2338.24] Hears them in his own native language?
[2339.00 → 2341.12] Parthians, Medes, and Elamite
[2341.12 → 2343.96] Residents of Mesopotamia
[2343.96 → 2346.40] Judea and Cappadocia
[2346.40 → 2347.92] Pontus and Asia
[2347.92 → 2350.28] Phage and Pamphylia
[2350.28 → 2353.12] Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene
[2353.12 → 2354.84] Visitors from Rome
[2354.84 → 2356.78] Both Jews and converts to Judaism
[2356.78 → 2358.74] Cretans and Arabs
[2358.74 → 2361.70] We hear them declaring the wonders of God
[2361.70 → 2362.76] In our own tongues
[2362.76 → 2366.00] Amazed and perplexed
[2366.00 → 2367.66] They asked one another
[2367.66 → 2369.64] What does this mean?
[2370.70 → 2372.88] Some, however, made fun of them
[2372.88 → 2373.68] And said
[2373.68 → 2375.96] They have had too much wine
[2375.96 → 2378.14] This is the word of the Lord
[2378.14 → 2382.66] So let's pray together
[2382.66 → 2384.38] And ask for God's blessing upon
[2384.38 → 2386.18] The reading and the preaching of his word
[2386.18 → 2386.72] This morning
[2386.72 → 2387.16] Let's pray
[2387.16 → 2388.60] Heavenly Father
[2388.60 → 2389.96] We ask now that you would
[2389.96 → 2391.72] Pour out your spirit upon us
[2391.72 → 2395.12] That we might be filled with your own life
[2395.12 → 2398.14] That we might know the truth of your scriptures
[2398.14 → 2401.24] O Lord, lead us into all truth
[2401.24 → 2404.36] So that we might know your son, Jesus Christ
[2404.36 → 2406.42] And worship him truly
[2406.42 → 2408.58] In his name we pray
[2408.58 → 2409.44] Amen
[2409.44 → 2415.52] As I've shared, of course, with you many times
[2415.52 → 2417.94] My family and I lived in Taiwan
[2417.94 → 2419.20] In Asia
[2419.20 → 2420.32] For a number of years
[2420.32 → 2422.20] And in Taiwan
[2422.20 → 2426.16] The climate is oppressively hot and muggy
[2426.16 → 2428.60] Not like it is here
[2428.60 → 2431.08] Especially in the summer
[2431.08 → 2432.54] So just imagine hot
[2432.54 → 2434.14] And imagine muggy
[2434.14 → 2437.82] The air could be very heavy
[2437.82 → 2438.94] Right?
[2438.94 → 2441.30] And the pollution of the city
[2441.30 → 2442.96] Is a very populous place
[2442.96 → 2443.94] Very crowded
[2443.94 → 2446.98] Lots of vehicles and scooters
[2446.98 → 2451.94] And the air would just hold all of this pollution
[2451.94 → 2453.94] But every
[2453.94 → 2455.08] So often
[2455.08 → 2456.28] Every couple of months
[2456.28 → 2460.08] A typhoon would blow across the island
[2460.08 → 2462.12] With hurricane force winds
[2462.12 → 2464.66] And a deluge of rain
[2464.66 → 2466.76] And the best part
[2466.76 → 2468.90] About a typhoon coming through
[2468.90 → 2471.24] Is that for almost a whole week afterwards
[2471.24 → 2473.78] The air feels clean
[2473.78 → 2476.46] The sky is blue
[2476.46 → 2477.98] And it's beautiful
[2477.98 → 2480.36] And everything feels renewed
[2480.36 → 2482.42] Much like we experience every day
[2482.42 → 2486.84] But soon, you know, the winds die down
[2486.84 → 2489.26] The heat and humidity returns
[2489.26 → 2492.74] And we would long for another typhoon
[2492.74 → 2494.40] To come again soon
[2494.40 → 2497.64] Now this came to mind to me this week
[2497.64 → 2501.78] Because both the Greek and the Hebrew words
[2501.78 → 2502.78] For the spirit
[2502.78 → 2507.02] Can also mean breath or wind
[2507.02 → 2511.90] And so similarly to a typhoon
[2511.90 → 2513.70] Kind of coming and going
[2513.70 → 2514.80] Blowing through
[2514.80 → 2517.44] Before Pentecost
[2517.44 → 2521.22] The Holy Spirit would blow strongly
[2521.22 → 2522.96] Through the story of God
[2522.96 → 2524.52] And through the story of God's people
[2524.52 → 2527.66] But only occasionally
[2527.66 → 2529.34] Do we see glimpses
[2529.34 → 2530.34] And moments
[2530.34 → 2533.00] Of the spirit's wind
[2533.00 → 2535.34] But then on Pentecost
[2535.86 → 2537.24] Everything changed
[2537.24 → 2539.02] And the Holy Spirit entered
[2539.02 → 2540.62] Into the story of God's people
[2540.62 → 2541.94] In a new way
[2541.94 → 2543.12] That was so overwhelming
[2543.34 → 2546.12] The people scarcely knew what to do
[2546.12 → 2549.36] And so here are just a few
[2549.36 → 2551.56] Of the occasional glimpses
[2551.56 → 2552.30] That we get
[2552.30 → 2553.86] Of the Holy Spirit
[2553.86 → 2555.72] Blowing through the pages
[2555.72 → 2556.46] Of the Old Testament
[2556.46 → 2558.48] So we meet the Holy Spirit
[2558.48 → 2559.58] In the Book of Genesis
[2559.58 → 2562.00] The very second verse
[2562.00 → 2562.94] Of the Bible
[2562.94 → 2564.52] Genesis chapter 1 verse 2
[2564.52 → 2566.34] It says this
[2566.34 → 2568.74] Now the earth was formless
[2568.74 → 2569.90] And empty
[2569.90 → 2572.48] Darkness was over the surface
[2572.48 → 2573.38] Of the deep
[2573.38 → 2575.62] And the spirit of God
[2575.62 → 2578.18] Was hovering over the waters
[2578.18 → 2580.78] So we meet the Holy Spirit first
[2580.78 → 2582.38] As the creator
[2582.38 → 2584.82] And then we see the Holy Spirit
[2584.82 → 2585.76] As a guide
[2585.76 → 2587.54] In the pillar of cloud
[2587.54 → 2589.82] In the fire that leads the Israelites
[2589.82 → 2590.84] Through the wilderness
[2590.84 → 2593.86] We see the Holy Spirit
[2593.86 → 2594.58] As a teacher
[2594.58 → 2596.66] Psalm 143 says
[2596.66 → 2598.10] Teach me to do your will
[2598.10 → 2599.92] For you are my God
[2599.92 → 2602.78] May your good spirit lead me
[2602.78 → 2603.92] On level ground
[2603.92 → 2605.94] May your spirit lead me
[2605.94 → 2608.06] We see the spirit
[2608.06 → 2609.42] As the presence of God
[2609.42 → 2611.12] Psalm 51 says
[2611.12 → 2612.06] Cast me not away
[2612.06 → 2613.22] From your presence
[2613.22 → 2614.16] O God
[2614.16 → 2616.30] Take not your Holy Spirit
[2616.30 → 2616.86] From me
[2616.86 → 2619.34] And then we see
[2619.34 → 2620.60] The spirit empower
[2620.60 → 2621.44] God's people
[2621.44 → 2623.48] For special roles
[2623.48 → 2624.54] We're told
[2624.54 → 2626.26] That Moses' successor
[2626.26 → 2626.84] Joshua
[2626.84 → 2628.68] Was a man of the spirit
[2628.68 → 2630.44] God gave Joshua
[2630.44 → 2631.00] The spirit
[2631.00 → 2632.00] To be a leader
[2632.00 → 2632.74] Of God's people
[2632.74 → 2633.44] To lead them
[2633.44 → 2634.80] Into the promised land
[2634.80 → 2637.66] Then hundreds of years later
[2637.66 → 2638.56] After Israel
[2638.56 → 2640.14] Had been unfaithful to God
[2640.14 → 2641.64] And they were taken
[2641.64 → 2642.52] Out of the land
[2642.52 → 2643.68] By the Babylonians
[2643.68 → 2645.36] We see the spirit
[2645.36 → 2646.50] Fill the prophets
[2646.50 → 2647.86] To speak
[2647.86 → 2648.82] On God's behalf
[2648.82 → 2649.46] To his people
[2649.46 → 2650.76] Right
[2650.76 → 2651.62] And God gives
[2651.62 → 2652.88] The prophet Ezekiel
[2652.88 → 2653.56] A vision
[2653.56 → 2654.80] Of a valley
[2654.80 → 2656.66] Of dry bones
[2656.66 → 2658.20] Representing Israel
[2658.20 → 2659.88] But the dry bones
[2659.88 → 2660.58] In the vision
[2660.58 → 2662.30] They are restored
[2662.30 → 2663.04] To life
[2663.04 → 2664.16] By the breath
[2664.16 → 2664.64] Of God
[2664.64 → 2666.06] And it calls it
[2666.06 → 2666.92] The spirit
[2666.92 → 2667.60] Of God
[2667.60 → 2669.44] And in fact
[2669.44 → 2670.76] Ezekiel's vision
[2670.76 → 2672.62] Begins to be fulfilled
[2672.62 → 2674.08] In our passage
[2674.08 → 2674.64] This morning
[2674.64 → 2675.80] In Acts chapter 2
[2675.80 → 2677.52] But now
[2677.52 → 2678.84] Before Pentecost
[2678.84 → 2680.04] Before all that happens
[2680.04 → 2682.32] As the years go by
[2682.32 → 2683.92] As history unfolds
[2683.92 → 2686.70] We see the spirit present
[2686.70 → 2688.68] The spirit is active
[2688.68 → 2689.92] In the world
[2689.92 → 2692.02] But only in limited ways
[2692.02 → 2693.74] And the spirit
[2693.74 → 2695.24] Is with some people
[2695.24 → 2696.60] But certainly not
[2696.60 → 2697.70] With all of God's people
[2697.70 → 2699.22] And he's active
[2699.22 → 2700.16] For brief moments
[2700.16 → 2700.74] Of time
[2700.74 → 2701.80] Empowering his people
[2701.80 → 2703.30] For specific roles
[2703.30 → 2704.68] But then he departs
[2704.68 → 2707.76] And at this point
[2707.76 → 2709.82] It's worth
[2709.82 → 2711.16] Doing some
[2711.16 → 2712.32] Self-reflection
[2712.32 → 2714.32] And considering
[2714.32 → 2715.02] That there are
[2715.02 → 2716.04] A lot of people today
[2716.04 → 2716.76] There are a lot of
[2716.76 → 2717.08] Christians
[2717.08 → 2718.02] Even in the church
[2718.02 → 2719.28] Who still think
[2719.28 → 2720.14] Of the Holy Spirit
[2720.14 → 2721.64] Like we're still
[2721.64 → 2722.62] In the Old Testament
[2722.62 → 2724.28] Right
[2724.28 → 2724.98] For a lot of us
[2724.98 → 2725.94] We might have the idea
[2725.94 → 2726.62] That the Holy Spirit
[2726.62 → 2727.16] Is limited
[2727.16 → 2728.68] That only
[2728.68 → 2730.22] Some Christians
[2730.22 → 2731.24] Have more access
[2731.24 → 2732.12] To the Holy Spirit
[2732.12 → 2732.90] Than others do
[2732.90 → 2735.36] And we can also
[2735.36 → 2736.02] Have this idea
[2736.02 → 2736.64] That the spirit
[2736.64 → 2737.20] Can only
[2737.20 → 2738.62] Maybe only really
[2738.62 → 2739.62] Empowers us
[2739.62 → 2740.58] Occasionally
[2740.58 → 2742.20] Maybe
[2742.20 → 2744.20] At unique
[2744.20 → 2745.12] And special times
[2745.12 → 2745.68] In our lives
[2745.68 → 2746.46] Where we really
[2746.46 → 2747.62] Take a step in faith
[2747.62 → 2749.12] But otherwise
[2749.12 → 2750.72] Apart from those times
[2750.72 → 2752.48] Is the Holy Spirit
[2752.48 → 2753.30] Really even active
[2753.30 → 2754.30] In my life at all
[2754.30 → 2757.84] But I think
[2757.84 → 2758.94] As we look
[2758.94 → 2759.56] Closely
[2759.56 → 2760.98] At this amazing story
[2760.98 → 2761.62] In the book of Acts
[2761.62 → 2762.06] This morning
[2762.06 → 2763.04] I think what we find
[2763.04 → 2763.96] Is that in fact
[2763.96 → 2765.46] The opposite is true
[2765.46 → 2767.94] I think that we will see
[2767.94 → 2769.10] Instead
[2769.10 → 2770.62] Of the Holy Spirit
[2770.62 → 2771.60] Being just limited
[2771.60 → 2772.42] And temporary
[2772.42 → 2774.76] We find that the Holy Spirit
[2774.76 → 2775.40] Is now
[2775.40 → 2777.30] After Pentecost
[2777.30 → 2777.98] Available
[2777.98 → 2779.42] And
[2779.42 → 2780.84] He is always active
[2780.84 → 2782.14] In and through
[2782.14 → 2782.72] His people
[2782.72 → 2783.66] Okay
[2783.66 → 2784.18] He is
[2784.18 → 2784.88] Available
[2784.88 → 2786.22] To all Christians
[2786.22 → 2787.44] And he is
[2787.44 → 2788.52] Always active
[2788.52 → 2789.04] At work
[2789.04 → 2790.38] In our lives
[2790.38 → 2791.76] So that's what I want us
[2791.76 → 2792.40] To see this morning
[2792.40 → 2793.14] Those two points
[2793.14 → 2794.42] So let's look
[2794.42 → 2795.40] At our passage again
[2795.40 → 2796.06] And the first thing
[2796.06 → 2796.68] We want to see
[2796.68 → 2798.40] Is that the Holy Spirit
[2798.40 → 2799.04] Is available
[2799.04 → 2799.44] Okay
[2799.44 → 2800.18] So let's take a look
[2800.18 → 2800.60] At this
[2800.60 → 2801.54] Holy Spirit
[2801.54 → 2802.00] Is available
[2802.00 → 2802.84] And let's look
[2802.84 → 2803.80] At verses 1 and 2
[2803.80 → 2805.20] So we'll read it
[2805.20 → 2806.02] And then Michaela
[2806.02 → 2806.84] Just leave it up there
[2806.84 → 2807.28] For a while
[2807.28 → 2807.72] Okay
[2807.72 → 2810.98] When the day of Pentecost came
[2810.98 → 2812.54] They were all together
[2812.54 → 2813.40] In one place
[2813.40 → 2814.62] Suddenly
[2814.62 → 2815.84] A sound
[2815.84 → 2816.52] Like the blowing
[2816.52 → 2817.54] Of a violent wind
[2817.54 → 2818.42] Came from heaven
[2818.42 → 2820.04] And filled the whole house
[2820.04 → 2822.26] Where they were sitting
[2822.26 → 2823.76] Okay
[2823.76 → 2827.42] There are many mysterious things
[2827.42 → 2828.52] Happening in this story
[2828.52 → 2831.44] It's easy
[2831.44 → 2832.72] To miss
[2832.72 → 2834.44] The most basic thing
[2834.44 → 2835.44] Happening in the story
[2835.44 → 2836.94] The crucial thing
[2836.94 → 2837.54] That's happening
[2837.54 → 2838.26] Which is
[2838.26 → 2839.82] That this is happening
[2839.82 → 2842.08] To the whole group
[2842.08 → 2843.94] In other words
[2843.94 → 2845.26] It wasn't just
[2845.26 → 2846.66] Peter, James, and John
[2846.66 → 2847.54] Right
[2847.54 → 2849.50] Jesus' closest disciples
[2849.50 → 2851.72] It was not only
[2851.72 → 2853.36] The original apostles
[2853.36 → 2856.50] It wasn't just the men
[2856.50 → 2859.12] It was everybody
[2859.12 → 2861.68] Notice the text says
[2861.68 → 2863.84] They were all together
[2863.84 → 2866.46] In one place
[2866.46 → 2866.96] Right
[2866.96 → 2867.68] In verse 1
[2867.68 → 2869.58] Who is
[2869.58 → 2870.88] They're referring to
[2870.88 → 2871.84] They were all together
[2871.84 → 2872.32] In one place
[2872.32 → 2873.14] Who is they
[2873.14 → 2875.34] Well in chapter 1
[2875.34 → 2876.18] Verse 15
[2876.18 → 2877.26] Luke mentions
[2877.26 → 2877.78] That there were
[2877.78 → 2878.76] A group of believers
[2878.76 → 2879.76] Gathered together
[2879.76 → 2881.74] Numbering about 120
[2881.74 → 2883.54] That's probably
[2883.54 → 2884.50] The same group here
[2884.50 → 2885.68] 120 people
[2885.68 → 2886.62] So we have
[2886.62 → 2887.62] Not just the
[2887.62 → 2888.68] Peter, James, and John
[2888.68 → 2889.62] Not just the 12
[2889.62 → 2890.68] But we have
[2890.68 → 2891.84] Young and old
[2891.84 → 2893.82] We have male and female
[2893.82 → 2894.88] Single and married
[2894.88 → 2896.72] Different stations of life
[2896.72 → 2898.04] All of them
[2898.04 → 2900.26] Filled with the Holy Spirit
[2900.26 → 2903.00] Before Pentecost
[2903.00 → 2904.44] The Spirit was limited
[2904.44 → 2905.38] Only filling
[2905.38 → 2906.68] Certain people
[2906.68 → 2908.46] Certain individuals of God
[2908.46 → 2909.64] But now the Spirit
[2909.64 → 2910.82] Has become available
[2910.82 → 2912.52] To everyone
[2912.52 → 2914.40] Who is part of the church
[2914.40 → 2917.38] Okay, we need to see that
[2917.38 → 2918.72] And so
[2918.72 → 2919.72] Okay, now the Holy Spirit
[2919.72 → 2921.06] Is available to everyone
[2921.06 → 2922.56] So we might wonder
[2922.56 → 2923.90] Well, how do I qualify?
[2924.86 → 2926.58] How can the Holy Spirit
[2926.58 → 2927.60] Come into my life?
[2928.56 → 2929.54] How do I qualify?
[2930.04 → 2931.10] And the good news is
[2931.10 → 2932.92] You don't
[2932.92 → 2934.16] Right?
[2934.26 → 2934.86] There is
[2934.86 → 2935.90] No checklist
[2935.90 → 2936.84] That I can find
[2936.84 → 2937.80] Anywhere in the Bible
[2937.80 → 2939.40] Of things that we're
[2939.40 → 2940.12] Supposed to do
[2940.12 → 2940.74] Things we're supposed
[2940.74 → 2941.58] To check off
[2941.58 → 2943.20] In order to receive
[2943.20 → 2943.80] The Holy Spirit
[2943.80 → 2945.12] Right?
[2945.12 → 2946.08] The striking thing
[2946.08 → 2946.96] About these verses
[2946.96 → 2948.64] And what these verses
[2948.64 → 2949.68] Obviously show us
[2949.68 → 2951.54] Is just how active
[2951.54 → 2953.12] God is towards them
[2953.12 → 2955.12] And also
[2955.12 → 2957.06] Simply how receptive
[2957.06 → 2959.06] They are towards God
[2959.06 → 2960.78] So let me show you
[2960.78 → 2961.42] What I mean here
[2961.42 → 2962.52] So in verse 2
[2962.52 → 2963.18] Still up there
[2963.18 → 2963.72] On the screen
[2963.72 → 2965.30] Look at the word
[2965.30 → 2966.04] Suddenly
[2966.04 → 2966.80] Verse 2
[2966.80 → 2967.40] Suddenly
[2967.40 → 2970.00] That's a fascinating word
[2970.00 → 2971.00] Suddenly
[2971.00 → 2972.08] Right?
[2972.16 → 2973.20] There was no warning
[2973.20 → 2974.90] There was no preparation
[2974.90 → 2975.72] They weren't doing
[2975.72 → 2976.86] All this stuff first
[2976.86 → 2978.78] They knew
[2978.78 → 2980.12] That Jesus promised
[2980.12 → 2980.94] To send the Spirit
[2980.94 → 2982.42] And that they were
[2982.42 → 2983.66] To wait for the Spirit
[2983.66 → 2985.76] But when he came
[2985.76 → 2986.94] It was sudden
[2986.94 → 2988.90] And it was at the
[2988.90 → 2989.86] Initiative of God
[2989.86 → 2992.08] God sent the Spirit
[2992.08 → 2994.52] Then it says
[2994.52 → 2995.58] In verse 2 also
[2995.58 → 2996.64] It says
[2996.64 → 2997.12] Suddenly
[2997.12 → 2998.36] A sound
[2998.36 → 2999.86] Like the blowing
[2999.86 → 3000.66] Of a
[3000.66 → 3002.46] Violent wind
[3002.46 → 3004.38] Came from where?
[3004.90 → 3007.94] Class
[3007.94 → 3009.28] Heaven
[3009.28 → 3010.06] Thank you
[3010.06 → 3011.48] Came from heaven
[3011.48 → 3012.40] Right?
[3012.48 → 3012.82] And so
[3012.82 → 3013.72] The blessing
[3013.72 → 3014.44] Of the Spirit
[3014.44 → 3014.98] Did not come
[3014.98 → 3015.46] From any
[3015.46 → 3016.60] Earthly source
[3016.60 → 3017.24] At all
[3017.24 → 3018.64] It came from heaven
[3018.64 → 3019.48] It didn't come
[3019.48 → 3020.28] From the apostles
[3020.28 → 3021.44] Right?
[3021.50 → 3022.40] The leaders of the church
[3022.40 → 3022.90] It came from
[3022.90 → 3023.54] God the Father
[3023.54 → 3025.24] The Spirit
[3025.24 → 3026.06] Does not come
[3026.06 → 3027.56] From the pastor
[3027.56 → 3029.84] Or anyone else
[3029.84 → 3031.18] I am just
[3031.18 → 3032.10] As needy
[3032.10 → 3033.88] As anybody else
[3033.88 → 3034.48] If not
[3034.48 → 3035.10] More
[3035.10 → 3036.54] For the Spirit
[3036.54 → 3038.64] And it says
[3038.64 → 3039.48] A sound
[3039.48 → 3040.88] Like the blowing
[3040.88 → 3042.42] Of a violent wind
[3042.42 → 3043.52] Okay
[3043.52 → 3045.50] When a violent wind blows
[3045.50 → 3046.62] What does that sound like?
[3047.22 → 3047.88] Is it quiet?
[3047.88 → 3048.38] No
[3048.38 → 3050.56] It's not quiet
[3050.56 → 3052.20] It is very loud
[3052.20 → 3053.94] This was not
[3053.94 → 3055.22] A gentle breeze
[3055.22 → 3056.64] This was more
[3056.64 → 3057.50] Like a typhoon
[3057.50 → 3058.98] Meaning
[3058.98 → 3060.30] It was just
[3060.30 → 3061.04] Too obvious
[3061.04 → 3061.64] To miss
[3061.64 → 3062.12] Right?
[3062.40 → 3063.64] Nobody had a sort
[3063.64 → 3064.10] Of like
[3064.10 → 3065.56] Take it by faith
[3065.56 → 3066.44] As we say
[3066.44 → 3067.40] Right?
[3067.46 → 3068.04] It wasn't something
[3068.04 → 3069.08] That only the most
[3069.08 → 3070.00] Sensitive
[3070.00 → 3070.86] Spiritually
[3070.86 → 3072.02] People in the group
[3072.02 → 3073.20] Would notice
[3073.20 → 3073.98] And would get
[3073.98 → 3075.72] While others
[3075.72 → 3077.08] Like me
[3077.08 → 3077.64] Kind of more
[3077.64 → 3078.24] A little dense
[3078.24 → 3079.20] Spiritually maybe
[3079.20 → 3080.58] Would miss out on
[3080.58 → 3081.24] No
[3081.24 → 3083.58] Even the crowds
[3083.58 → 3084.78] Who didn't yet
[3084.78 → 3085.50] Believe in Jesus
[3085.50 → 3086.46] It says in verse 6
[3086.46 → 3087.72] They were bewildered
[3087.72 → 3088.96] When they heard the sound
[3088.96 → 3089.40] They were like
[3089.40 → 3089.92] Whoa
[3089.92 → 3091.36] Right?
[3091.48 → 3092.80] It was unmistakable
[3092.80 → 3093.96] To every single person
[3093.96 → 3095.06] Who was there
[3095.06 → 3097.38] Verse 2
[3097.38 → 3098.16] Also says
[3098.16 → 3099.22] It filled
[3099.22 → 3100.44] The whole house
[3100.44 → 3101.76] Right?
[3101.84 → 3102.82] So just kind of
[3102.82 → 3104.04] Graciously
[3104.04 → 3105.12] And sweetly
[3105.12 → 3106.32] The Spirit of God
[3106.32 → 3107.52] Just blew out
[3107.52 → 3109.76] All human glory
[3109.76 → 3111.70] All human pride
[3111.70 → 3113.18] All human self-sufficiency
[3113.18 → 3116.70] Where they were sitting
[3116.70 → 3118.70] They were just sitting there
[3118.70 → 3120.24] That's all they were doing
[3120.24 → 3121.12] They were just sitting
[3121.12 → 3121.94] Waiting
[3121.94 → 3123.28] Patiently
[3123.28 → 3124.46] Quietly
[3124.46 → 3125.58] Receptively
[3125.58 → 3127.68] Not causatively
[3127.68 → 3128.08] Not
[3128.08 → 3129.80] Not doing anything
[3129.80 → 3131.54] Which would compel
[3131.54 → 3132.48] God to send the Spirit
[3132.48 → 3134.22] But they just waited on Him
[3134.22 → 3135.66] And God poured out the Spirit
[3135.66 → 3137.36] Upon everyone there
[3137.36 → 3138.64] And what this means
[3138.64 → 3139.02] Friends
[3139.02 → 3140.60] Is that the Holy Spirit
[3140.60 → 3141.30] Is available
[3141.30 → 3142.78] To you
[3142.78 → 3144.62] The Holy Spirit
[3144.62 → 3145.46] Is available to you
[3145.46 → 3146.46] Right?
[3146.54 → 3147.64] And there is so much
[3147.64 → 3148.22] We need to learn
[3148.22 → 3149.02] About the Holy Spirit
[3149.02 → 3150.74] But right now
[3150.74 → 3153.02] I just want us to focus
[3153.02 → 3154.86] On the Spirit's availability
[3154.86 → 3157.08] To us
[3157.08 → 3157.86] Right?
[3157.90 → 3158.66] That's a good place
[3158.66 → 3159.92] For every Christian to start
[3159.92 → 3161.74] The Holy Spirit
[3161.74 → 3162.46] Is available
[3162.46 → 3163.68] To every single man
[3163.68 → 3164.56] Woman and child
[3164.56 → 3165.98] In this room
[3165.98 → 3167.52] Do you believe that?
[3169.34 → 3170.34] Is that true
[3170.34 → 3171.24] In your life?
[3173.22 → 3174.12] The Holy Spirit
[3174.12 → 3175.08] Is available to you
[3175.08 → 3176.40] And if there is
[3176.40 → 3177.58] Any qualification
[3177.58 → 3179.30] That we are to have
[3179.30 → 3180.24] That we have to meet
[3180.24 → 3181.68] The only qualification
[3181.68 → 3182.98] Is simply to be receptive
[3182.98 → 3184.14] Right?
[3184.20 → 3184.88] To embrace
[3184.88 → 3186.46] Jesus as our King
[3186.46 → 3188.24] To receive His kingship
[3188.24 → 3191.02] And the same Holy Spirit
[3191.02 → 3191.86] Jesus promises
[3191.86 → 3193.18] Will fill us as well
[3193.18 → 3195.02] Okay?
[3195.02 → 3196.16] So that's just the first thing
[3196.16 → 3196.52] We see
[3196.52 → 3197.46] The Holy Spirit
[3197.46 → 3198.36] Is available
[3198.36 → 3200.70] To all Christians
[3200.70 → 3201.40] In a way that
[3201.40 → 3202.98] It never has been before
[3202.98 → 3205.18] So now let's continue
[3205.18 → 3206.08] With our second point
[3206.08 → 3206.70] This morning
[3206.70 → 3208.46] The Holy Spirit
[3208.46 → 3210.14] Is active
[3210.14 → 3211.00] The Holy Spirit
[3211.00 → 3211.60] Is active
[3211.60 → 3213.76] Not just available
[3213.76 → 3214.46] To every Christian
[3214.46 → 3215.88] But He's also active
[3215.88 → 3217.90] Empowering every Christian
[3217.90 → 3218.56] To live
[3218.56 → 3220.26] For the glory of God
[3220.26 → 3221.38] And to continue
[3221.38 → 3223.16] Jesus' ministry
[3223.16 → 3224.80] So remember
[3224.80 → 3226.08] We began reading
[3226.08 → 3227.38] From Luke 24
[3227.38 → 3229.26] Verse 49
[3229.26 → 3230.52] So let's look at that again
[3230.52 → 3231.04] For a moment
[3231.04 → 3233.36] Jesus said
[3233.36 → 3234.94] I am going to send you
[3234.94 → 3236.14] What my Father has promised
[3236.14 → 3237.42] But stay in the city
[3237.42 → 3239.32] Until you have been
[3239.32 → 3240.54] Clothed with power
[3240.54 → 3242.76] From on high
[3242.76 → 3245.68] So not only does God
[3245.68 → 3246.74] Send the Spirit
[3246.74 → 3247.88] Of His own initiative
[3247.88 → 3249.34] But Jesus says
[3249.34 → 3250.04] To His disciples
[3250.04 → 3252.12] Don't do anything
[3252.12 → 3254.12] Stay in Jerusalem
[3254.12 → 3255.72] Don't even think about leaving
[3255.72 → 3257.80] Until the Holy Spirit comes
[3257.80 → 3259.48] Because until the Holy Spirit comes
[3259.48 → 3261.36] You don't have the power
[3261.36 → 3264.26] But when the Holy Spirit comes
[3264.26 → 3265.80] You will have the power
[3265.80 → 3269.42] We, you know
[3269.42 → 3273.24] Are weak-kneed followers of Jesus
[3273.24 → 3277.04] I mean, how are people like us
[3277.04 → 3278.36] Going to mend the world?
[3279.52 → 3281.10] How are people like us
[3281.10 → 3283.14] Going to proclaim the gospel?
[3284.14 → 3286.80] Make disciples of all the nations
[3286.80 → 3288.68] Like Jesus has told us
[3288.68 → 3289.86] Where forgiveness of sins
[3289.86 → 3290.62] Would be proclaimed
[3290.62 → 3291.68] To all the nations
[3291.68 → 3293.92] You can't
[3293.92 → 3295.10] Right?
[3295.22 → 3295.72] And you know
[3295.72 → 3297.66] I can't even floss my teeth every day
[3297.66 → 3299.06] That's a confession
[3299.06 → 3301.66] The answer is
[3301.66 → 3303.18] We don't mend the world
[3303.18 → 3304.80] Jesus does
[3304.80 → 3305.98] Right?
[3306.04 → 3307.48] We don't bring people to faith
[3307.48 → 3308.14] In Jesus
[3308.14 → 3309.14] Jesus does
[3309.14 → 3311.30] He does it through us
[3311.30 → 3313.50] By the power of the Holy Spirit
[3313.50 → 3315.00] Who is in us
[3315.00 → 3316.42] And working through us
[3316.42 → 3317.92] So Jesus says
[3317.92 → 3319.06] Stay in the city
[3319.06 → 3320.40] Until you have been clothed
[3320.40 → 3321.04] With power
[3321.04 → 3321.98] From on high
[3321.98 → 3325.58] Preachers famously love to
[3325.58 → 3326.22] Make this point
[3326.22 → 3327.00] And I'll just make it
[3327.00 → 3328.30] The Greek word
[3328.30 → 3330.06] Is dynamic
[3330.06 → 3330.84] Right?
[3331.10 → 3332.00] The power
[3332.00 → 3333.24] Of God
[3333.24 → 3334.32] And you know
[3334.32 → 3335.36] Alfred Nobel
[3335.36 → 3337.34] They named the Nobel Prize
[3337.34 → 3337.98] After him
[3337.98 → 3338.84] Do you know what
[3338.84 → 3340.16] His great invention was?
[3342.16 → 3342.72] Dynamite
[3342.72 → 3345.58] He invented this explosive compound
[3345.58 → 3347.26] And he felt so bad
[3347.26 → 3349.16] About his destructive influence
[3349.16 → 3350.44] That he gave away
[3350.44 → 3351.38] All the profits
[3351.38 → 3352.46] For world peace
[3352.46 → 3353.50] Thus
[3353.50 → 3354.70] The Nobel Peace Prize
[3354.70 → 3356.86] And he didn't know
[3356.86 → 3358.16] What to name this compound
[3358.16 → 3359.10] So he asked a friend
[3359.10 → 3360.20] Who was literate in Greek
[3360.20 → 3361.20] And the friend said
[3361.20 → 3362.46] We'll name it dynamite
[3362.46 → 3363.82] That's the Greek word
[3363.82 → 3364.92] For power
[3364.92 → 3367.88] That is the Holy Spirit
[3367.88 → 3369.72] The power of God
[3369.72 → 3371.20] Who equips us
[3371.20 → 3371.84] With the power
[3371.84 → 3372.74] Of the Holy Spirit
[3372.74 → 3373.82] To be ministers
[3373.82 → 3374.46] Of what?
[3375.46 → 3376.46] Of peace
[3376.46 → 3377.86] To be ministers
[3377.86 → 3378.44] Of peace
[3378.44 → 3379.60] Peace with God
[3379.60 → 3380.16] That we can have
[3380.16 → 3381.04] Through Jesus Christ
[3381.04 → 3382.14] We can't do it
[3382.14 → 3382.74] On our own
[3382.74 → 3384.56] Jesus doesn't ask us
[3384.56 → 3385.58] To do it on our own
[3385.58 → 3387.10] He gives us
[3387.10 → 3387.74] The Holy Spirit
[3387.74 → 3389.76] And so let's see
[3389.76 → 3390.76] What happens now
[3390.76 → 3392.56] On the day of Pentecost
[3392.56 → 3394.18] We return to
[3394.18 → 3395.50] Acts chapter 2
[3395.50 → 3396.96] And we'll pick up
[3396.96 → 3397.86] The story in verse 3
[3397.86 → 3399.30] It says
[3399.30 → 3400.76] They saw
[3400.76 → 3401.82] What seemed to be
[3401.82 → 3402.84] Tongues of fire
[3402.84 → 3403.56] That separated
[3403.56 → 3404.48] And came to rest
[3404.48 → 3405.30] On each of them
[3405.30 → 3407.56] So what happened?
[3409.82 → 3411.00] Something obviously
[3411.00 → 3412.72] Miraculous
[3412.72 → 3416.06] Something wonderful
[3416.06 → 3418.84] Something pretty intense
[3418.84 → 3420.80] Visible tongues of fire
[3420.80 → 3421.84] Resting on us
[3421.84 → 3422.70] Right?
[3422.82 → 3424.38] And like fire
[3424.38 → 3424.98] In the Bible
[3424.98 → 3426.76] Is a symbol of purity
[3426.76 → 3427.94] It's a symbol
[3427.94 → 3428.92] Of God's presence
[3428.92 → 3430.52] Pure like fire
[3430.52 → 3432.20] Holy like fire
[3432.20 → 3434.10] God's presence
[3434.10 → 3434.92] Fire like
[3434.92 → 3436.02] Came down
[3436.02 → 3436.60] And rested
[3436.60 → 3437.66] On each one of them
[3437.66 → 3439.62] And they were
[3439.62 → 3440.74] Never the same again
[3440.74 → 3442.60] They said goodbye
[3442.60 → 3444.12] To their old
[3444.12 → 3445.30] Life
[3445.30 → 3446.14] Their old
[3446.14 → 3447.12] Normal life
[3447.12 → 3448.64] A very happy goodbye
[3448.64 → 3451.38] And you know
[3451.38 → 3452.42] And if you as a Christian
[3452.42 → 3454.04] Have confessed faith
[3454.04 → 3454.38] In Christ
[3454.38 → 3454.80] And you have
[3454.80 → 3455.30] The Holy Spirit
[3455.30 → 3456.88] You don't want
[3456.88 → 3457.46] To go back
[3457.46 → 3458.26] Right?
[3458.48 → 3459.12] If you have
[3459.12 → 3459.56] The Holy Spirit
[3459.56 → 3460.16] Living in you
[3460.16 → 3461.48] You say goodbye
[3461.48 → 3462.26] To that old life
[3462.26 → 3462.80] And you don't want
[3462.80 → 3463.46] To go back to it
[3463.46 → 3464.20] Because now you
[3464.20 → 3464.78] Have the Spirit
[3464.78 → 3467.30] And then it says
[3467.30 → 3468.00] In verse 4
[3468.00 → 3469.78] All of them
[3469.78 → 3470.70] Were filled
[3470.70 → 3471.80] With the Holy Spirit
[3471.80 → 3473.22] And began to speak
[3473.22 → 3474.10] In other tongues
[3474.10 → 3475.20] As the Spirit
[3475.20 → 3476.06] Enabled them
[3476.06 → 3478.06] So notice it says
[3478.06 → 3479.64] Other tongues
[3479.64 → 3482.02] Because they were
[3482.02 → 3483.36] Galileans
[3483.36 → 3485.02] Their mother tongue
[3485.02 → 3485.84] Does anybody know?
[3486.84 → 3488.00] It was Aramaic
[3488.00 → 3490.30] So Jesus' disciples
[3490.30 → 3491.80] Were mostly from Galilee
[3491.80 → 3492.50] In the north
[3492.50 → 3493.80] By the Sea of Galilee
[3493.80 → 3495.82] They were you know
[3495.82 → 3497.24] Not the elite
[3497.24 → 3498.58] Of society
[3498.58 → 3500.32] Later in the book of Acts
[3500.32 → 3501.82] They're called uneducated
[3501.82 → 3503.54] These were common folks
[3503.54 → 3505.62] They spoke Arabic
[3505.62 → 3506.62] Or not Arabic
[3506.62 → 3507.62] Aramaic
[3507.62 → 3509.60] That's the language
[3509.60 → 3510.54] They grew up speaking
[3510.54 → 3511.10] At home
[3511.10 → 3512.20] They were workers
[3512.20 → 3515.26] And so here they are
[3515.26 → 3516.60] Suddenly
[3516.60 → 3518.34] They were enabled
[3518.34 → 3519.56] By God above
[3519.56 → 3521.32] To speak in languages
[3521.32 → 3523.04] That they had never studied
[3523.04 → 3524.28] Presumably
[3524.28 → 3525.88] Perfectly fluently
[3525.88 → 3528.04] Such that
[3528.04 → 3529.30] An Arabic speaking
[3529.30 → 3530.00] Person
[3530.00 → 3530.80] Listening
[3530.80 → 3533.06] Was amazed
[3533.06 → 3535.60] And a Latin
[3535.60 → 3536.66] Speaking
[3536.66 → 3536.72] And a Latin
[3536.72 → 3536.74] Speaking
[3536.74 → 3537.66] Person
[3537.66 → 3538.48] From Rome
[3538.48 → 3539.10] It says
[3539.10 → 3540.68] Was astonished
[3540.68 → 3541.94] And so forth
[3541.94 → 3544.68] And they didn't even choose
[3544.68 → 3546.06] Which language
[3546.06 → 3547.18] They were going to speak
[3547.18 → 3547.40] You know
[3547.40 → 3548.04] I kind of imagine
[3548.04 → 3548.50] Being like
[3548.50 → 3549.50] Which one did you get?
[3549.70 → 3549.90] You know
[3549.90 → 3550.54] And like
[3550.54 → 3551.28] Comparing
[3551.28 → 3553.22] But this wasn't like
[3553.22 → 3553.70] Duolingo
[3553.70 → 3554.02] You know
[3554.02 → 3554.74] You might not know
[3554.74 → 3555.20] Duolingo
[3555.20 → 3556.38] It's like a
[3556.38 → 3556.94] Web app
[3556.94 → 3557.84] A website
[3557.84 → 3558.46] Where you can
[3558.46 → 3559.72] Choose to learn a language
[3559.72 → 3560.62] And you get to choose
[3560.62 → 3561.36] Your own language
[3561.36 → 3563.26] And you got to learn it
[3563.26 → 3563.80] It takes forever
[3563.80 → 3564.54] It's hard work
[3564.54 → 3565.62] But they were
[3565.62 → 3566.12] It says
[3566.12 → 3567.40] They began to speak
[3567.40 → 3568.48] In other tongues
[3568.48 → 3570.02] As the spirit
[3570.02 → 3571.46] Enabled them
[3571.46 → 3573.58] And the Holy Spirit
[3573.58 → 3575.50] Made each one
[3575.50 → 3577.20] An instant missionary
[3577.20 → 3579.12] To all the nations
[3579.12 → 3580.84] On the spot
[3580.84 → 3584.02] They received power
[3584.02 → 3585.58] Just like Jesus said
[3585.58 → 3587.30] So now
[3587.30 → 3588.30] One of the questions
[3588.30 → 3588.94] They ask is
[3588.94 → 3590.44] What does this mean?
[3590.66 → 3591.88] What is going on?
[3592.94 → 3593.26] You know
[3593.26 → 3593.96] And there are
[3593.96 → 3595.02] Other outpourings
[3595.02 → 3595.62] Of the Holy Spirit
[3595.62 → 3596.42] In the book of Acts
[3596.42 → 3598.26] Each one is unique
[3598.26 → 3600.80] God does not use
[3600.80 → 3601.46] A cookie cutter
[3601.46 → 3602.86] This is not a repeatable
[3602.86 → 3604.42] Thing that happened here
[3604.42 → 3605.76] But the key
[3605.76 → 3606.32] To understand
[3606.32 → 3607.12] What is going on
[3607.12 → 3607.54] Here
[3607.54 → 3608.84] On this day of Pentecost
[3608.84 → 3610.82] Is actually that word
[3610.82 → 3611.96] Pentecost
[3611.96 → 3612.68] In verse 1
[3612.68 → 3614.90] It was the day of Pentecost
[3614.90 → 3615.72] Pentecost was
[3615.72 → 3616.50] A Jewish holiday
[3616.50 → 3617.38] It was
[3617.38 → 3618.50] A harvest
[3618.50 → 3619.36] Celebration
[3619.36 → 3621.32] And then in Judaism
[3621.32 → 3622.44] Pentecost also
[3622.44 → 3623.06] Was celebrated
[3623.06 → 3624.00] As the day that
[3624.00 → 3625.56] Moses received the law
[3625.56 → 3626.62] On Mount Sinai
[3626.62 → 3628.20] And the Jews
[3628.20 → 3629.50] Have been celebrating
[3629.50 → 3630.26] Pentecost
[3630.26 → 3632.30] For hundreds of years
[3632.30 → 3633.22] At this point
[3633.22 → 3635.06] But this year
[3635.06 → 3637.16] On this Pentecost
[3637.16 → 3638.44] The Lord comes down
[3638.44 → 3639.08] Again
[3639.08 → 3640.28] As he did
[3640.28 → 3641.16] On Mount Sinai
[3641.16 → 3642.00] But this time
[3642.00 → 3642.60] The Lord comes
[3642.60 → 3643.46] Not to demand
[3643.46 → 3644.62] Something from the people
[3644.62 → 3646.20] According to the law
[3646.20 → 3647.22] But instead
[3647.22 → 3647.76] He comes down
[3647.76 → 3648.92] To give them something
[3648.92 → 3650.54] According to the gospel
[3650.54 → 3652.16] And that is
[3652.16 → 3653.28] The gift of the Holy Spirit
[3653.28 → 3655.08] And
[3655.08 → 3656.68] I mean
[3656.68 → 3657.84] What greater gift
[3657.84 → 3659.36] Is there from God?
[3660.50 → 3661.10] Think about
[3661.10 → 3662.10] Anything you could
[3662.10 → 3662.80] Receive from God
[3662.80 → 3663.96] What is the greatest gift
[3663.96 → 3664.98] You could receive from God?
[3664.98 → 3666.06] Would it not be
[3666.06 → 3666.96] The presence
[3666.96 → 3667.82] And the power
[3667.82 → 3669.78] Of the living God himself
[3669.78 → 3672.30] Filling his people
[3672.30 → 3673.84] Right?
[3673.94 → 3674.60] God does not have
[3674.60 → 3675.36] Anything greater
[3675.36 → 3676.40] To give us
[3676.40 → 3677.78] Than the Holy Spirit
[3677.78 → 3680.30] And in this outpouring
[3680.30 → 3681.08] Of the Holy Spirit
[3681.08 → 3681.40] This
[3681.40 → 3682.56] This gift
[3682.56 → 3683.58] Of his grace
[3683.58 → 3685.66] The ascended Christ
[3685.66 → 3686.50] Then launches
[3686.50 → 3688.10] A new harvest
[3688.10 → 3689.36] Over the whole world
[3689.36 → 3690.44] It's harvest celebration
[3690.44 → 3691.86] This is a new harvest
[3691.86 → 3692.52] That's going to happen
[3692.52 → 3693.96] People from every nation
[3693.96 → 3694.98] Coming
[3694.98 → 3696.36] Into the church
[3696.36 → 3698.12] You know
[3698.12 → 3698.96] Then verse 11
[3698.96 → 3699.58] It says
[3699.58 → 3700.92] Both Jews
[3700.92 → 3701.56] And converts
[3701.56 → 3702.30] To Judaism
[3702.30 → 3703.14] Cretans
[3703.14 → 3703.70] And Arabs
[3703.70 → 3704.10] All
[3704.10 → 3704.40] You know
[3704.40 → 3705.20] People gathered
[3705.20 → 3705.80] In Jerusalem
[3705.80 → 3707.28] From every nation
[3707.28 → 3707.90] Under heaven
[3707.90 → 3709.02] They said
[3709.02 → 3710.12] We hear them
[3710.12 → 3711.20] Declaring the wonders
[3711.20 → 3711.74] Of God
[3711.74 → 3713.62] In our own tongues
[3713.62 → 3715.52] Right?
[3715.60 → 3716.54] People hearing
[3716.54 → 3717.88] Who God really is
[3717.88 → 3719.54] In a way
[3719.54 → 3721.54] That meets them
[3721.54 → 3722.28] Where
[3722.28 → 3723.78] They really are
[3723.78 → 3725.16] In their own language
[3725.16 → 3727.24] And you know
[3727.24 → 3728.12] In the book of Revelation
[3728.12 → 3729.46] It says
[3729.46 → 3729.90] In heaven
[3729.90 → 3730.44] There's going to be
[3730.44 → 3731.30] This huge sea
[3731.30 → 3732.02] Of humanity
[3732.02 → 3733.00] People from
[3733.00 → 3734.38] Every ethnicity
[3734.38 → 3735.20] And culture
[3735.20 → 3736.22] And language
[3736.22 → 3738.00] You know
[3738.00 → 3738.64] What that means?
[3740.00 → 3741.02] It means that
[3741.02 → 3741.68] English
[3741.68 → 3743.06] Is going to be
[3743.06 → 3743.74] Spoken in heaven
[3743.74 → 3744.88] Did you ever
[3744.88 → 3745.30] Think of that?
[3746.32 → 3746.96] English is going
[3746.96 → 3747.30] To be spoken
[3747.30 → 3747.68] In heaven
[3747.68 → 3749.14] We as human beings
[3749.14 → 3750.08] Invented English
[3750.08 → 3750.42] Right?
[3750.50 → 3751.00] Adam and Eve
[3751.00 → 3751.76] Did not speak English
[3751.76 → 3752.38] It came later
[3752.38 → 3754.30] But God will preserve it
[3754.30 → 3756.20] God will preserve English
[3756.20 → 3756.94] He likes it
[3756.94 → 3758.44] He likes
[3758.44 → 3759.90] The southern accent
[3759.90 → 3760.86] Of my wife Christy
[3760.86 → 3762.56] He likes
[3762.56 → 3764.34] Where I came from
[3764.34 → 3765.26] We said we don't have an accent
[3765.26 → 3766.94] It's actually pure English
[3766.94 → 3767.86] So
[3767.86 → 3770.62] He likes the Canadian accent
[3770.62 → 3772.96] He likes the British accent
[3772.96 → 3774.02] And the Scottish accent
[3774.02 → 3775.80] And he is not only
[3775.80 → 3776.56] Going to preserve English
[3776.56 → 3777.22] But Dutch
[3777.22 → 3778.36] And Chinese
[3778.36 → 3779.24] And Farsi
[3779.24 → 3781.68] And not just our languages
[3781.68 → 3782.72] But all of these other
[3782.72 → 3784.10] Sort of fascinating aspects
[3784.10 → 3785.36] That make us who we are
[3785.36 → 3786.28] Culturally speaking
[3786.28 → 3788.12] God is not going to
[3788.12 → 3789.18] Trash all of that
[3789.18 → 3790.32] When Christ comes again
[3790.32 → 3791.80] He is going to redeem it
[3791.80 → 3792.60] And he is going to
[3792.60 → 3793.82] Preserve it forever
[3793.82 → 3796.50] In other words
[3796.50 → 3798.04] We can be comfortable
[3798.04 → 3799.88] In our own skin
[3799.88 → 3801.96] When we come to Jesus
[3801.96 → 3802.62] As the king
[3802.62 → 3805.10] The gospel takes root
[3805.10 → 3807.04] In every human heart
[3807.04 → 3808.84] Whoever we are
[3808.84 → 3810.54] People from all of these nations
[3810.54 → 3811.80] All of these cultures
[3811.80 → 3812.96] All of these languages
[3812.96 → 3814.36] The gospel comes to us
[3814.36 → 3815.08] In our own language
[3815.08 → 3817.46] And so we come
[3817.46 → 3818.78] As we are to the king
[3818.78 → 3820.48] And he purifies us
[3820.48 → 3821.10] With the spirit
[3821.10 → 3823.00] And he calls us
[3823.00 → 3824.44] To live according to the spirit
[3824.44 → 3826.30] In whole different ways
[3826.30 → 3827.84] That distinguish us
[3827.84 → 3829.02] In so many ways
[3829.02 → 3830.02] From the cultures
[3830.02 → 3830.86] That we come from
[3830.86 → 3832.08] And we are to be
[3832.08 → 3832.86] Then empowered
[3832.86 → 3833.92] With this new boldness
[3833.92 → 3835.22] To tell
[3835.22 → 3836.92] The wonderful works
[3836.92 → 3837.42] Of God
[3837.42 → 3839.58] To talk about Jesus
[3839.58 → 3841.20] To talk about the glory
[3841.20 → 3842.30] Of Jesus
[3842.30 → 3844.30] And the Holy Spirit
[3844.30 → 3844.66] Friends
[3844.66 → 3846.12] Is doing that today
[3846.12 → 3847.12] He is continuing
[3847.12 → 3847.66] To do it
[3847.66 → 3848.36] From Pentecost
[3848.36 → 3849.56] Up until today
[3849.56 → 3850.60] And he will continue
[3850.60 → 3851.24] To do so
[3851.24 → 3852.96] Until Jesus returns
[3852.96 → 3853.50] Gathering
[3853.50 → 3854.30] Gathering in
[3854.30 → 3855.22] All kinds of people
[3855.22 → 3856.80] Who don't stop
[3856.80 → 3857.64] Being who they are
[3857.64 → 3859.02] But who join together
[3859.02 → 3860.36] Around Christ
[3860.36 → 3861.78] As the church
[3861.78 → 3864.18] And the Holy Spirit
[3864.18 → 3864.76] Will continue
[3864.76 → 3865.84] To empower us
[3865.84 → 3867.30] To proclaim
[3867.98 → 3869.04] And to live out
[3869.04 → 3870.60] His redemptive
[3870.60 → 3871.42] And healing gospel
[3871.42 → 3872.68] To live it out
[3872.68 → 3873.30] In our lives
[3873.30 → 3873.88] And to live it out
[3873.88 → 3874.92] Before our watching world
[3874.92 → 3876.46] But you know
[3876.46 → 3876.96] It got off
[3876.96 → 3877.98] To a really rocky start
[3877.98 → 3880.06] So look at verse 13
[3880.06 → 3882.86] Some however said
[3882.86 → 3884.72] However made fun of them
[3884.72 → 3885.14] And said
[3885.14 → 3886.66] They have had too much wine
[3886.66 → 3889.18] So notice the response
[3889.18 → 3890.94] Some people say
[3890.94 → 3892.78] Made fun of them
[3892.78 → 3895.08] And I just like to
[3895.08 → 3895.62] Point that out
[3895.62 → 3896.50] Because you know
[3896.50 → 3897.42] It wasn't because
[3897.42 → 3898.90] The Christians were behaving
[3898.90 → 3899.96] In foolish ways
[3899.96 → 3901.82] But it's because
[3901.82 → 3903.16] A new community
[3903.16 → 3905.06] Under the divine power
[3905.06 → 3907.16] Is easily misunderstood
[3907.16 → 3910.48] And if you give
[3910.48 → 3911.30] Your heart to Jesus
[3911.30 → 3912.36] And his power
[3912.36 → 3913.28] Rests upon you
[3913.28 → 3916.30] You may be misjudged
[3916.30 → 3918.16] And you may be mocked
[3918.16 → 3919.88] And to the degree
[3919.88 → 3920.58] That you don't want
[3920.58 → 3921.52] That to happen to you
[3921.52 → 3922.62] You will not live out
[3922.62 → 3923.70] Your life in the power
[3923.70 → 3924.14] Of the spirit
[3924.14 → 3924.76] Right
[3924.76 → 3926.86] But if you're willing
[3926.86 → 3928.46] To live empowered
[3928.46 → 3929.22] By the spirit
[3929.22 → 3930.82] And you care
[3930.82 → 3931.28] You know
[3931.28 → 3932.84] That you are beloved
[3932.84 → 3934.16] By God above all things
[3934.16 → 3935.22] Then you will live
[3935.22 → 3936.10] According to the spirit
[3936.10 → 3936.96] And maybe the world
[3936.96 → 3937.48] Will mock you
[3937.48 → 3938.14] But you don't care
[3938.14 → 3939.14] Because I'm beloved
[3939.14 → 3939.62] By God
[3939.62 → 3943.36] So as we conclude
[3943.36 → 3945.36] Now let's just spend
[3945.36 → 3945.92] A moment
[3945.92 → 3946.46] Considering
[3946.46 → 3948.34] Some points of application
[3948.34 → 3951.50] And by way of application
[3951.50 → 3952.76] I just want to invite us
[3952.76 → 3953.28] This morning
[3953.28 → 3954.92] To be honest
[3954.92 → 3956.62] About our relationship
[3956.62 → 3958.40] With the Holy Spirit
[3958.40 → 3961.02] Let me just say
[3961.02 → 3961.76] The Holy Spirit
[3961.76 → 3964.20] Is not an impersonal force
[3964.20 → 3966.32] I love Star Wars
[3966.32 → 3967.50] I love Harry Potter
[3967.50 → 3968.36] It's so cool
[3968.36 → 3969.16] How they learn
[3969.16 → 3970.04] To use the force
[3970.04 → 3970.62] And they learn
[3970.62 → 3971.42] How to use magic
[3971.42 → 3972.36] And they can control
[3972.36 → 3973.36] Things for their own
[3973.36 → 3974.66] To do what they want
[3974.66 → 3975.22] To accomplish
[3975.22 → 3975.56] Right
[3975.56 → 3977.14] That's not the Holy Spirit
[3977.14 → 3977.62] The Holy Spirit
[3977.62 → 3978.20] Is a person
[3978.20 → 3980.88] It's not something
[3980.88 → 3981.70] We know
[3981.70 → 3983.30] Wield for our own purposes
[3983.30 → 3984.68] He's a person
[3984.68 → 3985.70] But so first
[3985.70 → 3987.60] The Holy Spirit
[3987.60 → 3988.22] Is available
[3988.22 → 3989.12] Right
[3989.12 → 3989.66] The Holy Spirit
[3989.66 → 3990.14] Is available
[3990.14 → 3992.34] So honestly ask yourself
[3992.34 → 3993.46] Is the Spirit of God
[3993.46 → 3994.50] Present in my life
[3994.50 → 3997.72] Is God present
[3997.72 → 3998.50] In your life
[3998.50 → 3999.40] By his Spirit
[3999.40 → 4000.54] Or does that sound
[4000.54 → 4001.48] More like a theory
[4001.48 → 4003.32] Or does it sound
[4003.32 → 4004.06] Something that's very
[4004.06 → 4005.06] Maybe elusive
[4005.06 → 4006.66] Or maybe something
[4006.66 → 4008.08] That's only for other Christians
[4008.08 → 4009.86] You know
[4009.86 → 4010.88] The Spirit of God
[4010.88 → 4012.08] Is not a performance
[4012.08 → 4013.74] Enhancing drug
[4013.74 → 4016.42] Only for Olympic Christians
[4016.42 → 4017.44] The Spirit of God
[4017.44 → 4019.48] Is an indispensable necessity
[4019.48 → 4022.98] For every real Christian
[4022.98 → 4025.30] And being you know
[4025.30 → 4026.94] Raised up in a Christian home
[4026.94 → 4027.54] And in a church
[4027.54 → 4028.10] Is wonderful
[4028.10 → 4029.08] But that's not what
[4029.08 → 4029.88] Makes you a Christian
[4029.88 → 4031.64] The Spirit of God
[4031.64 → 4032.64] Coming and living
[4032.64 → 4033.74] Within you
[4033.74 → 4036.30] Is what makes you
[4036.30 → 4037.02] A Christian
[4037.02 → 4038.30] Making you alive
[4038.30 → 4039.22] When you are dead
[4039.22 → 4040.08] In your sins
[4040.08 → 4041.30] Is what makes you a Christian
[4041.30 → 4041.98] And that's what
[4041.98 → 4042.84] The Holy Spirit does
[4042.84 → 4044.18] So the invitation
[4044.18 → 4045.92] Is to humbly
[4045.92 → 4047.54] Just open ourselves up
[4047.54 → 4049.46] And to receive
[4049.46 → 4050.04] The Holy Spirit
[4050.04 → 4051.48] Right
[4051.48 → 4052.32] And if you say
[4052.32 → 4053.42] Well I'm not qualified
[4053.42 → 4054.04] For that
[4054.04 → 4055.82] Exactly
[4055.82 → 4057.12] Great
[4057.12 → 4058.58] Because that is
[4058.58 → 4059.60] The only qualification
[4059.60 → 4060.16] There is
[4060.16 → 4061.80] To say
[4061.80 → 4062.82] I am not qualified
[4062.82 → 4064.46] Because
[4064.46 → 4066.00] You have available
[4066.00 → 4066.48] To you
[4066.48 → 4067.20] A gift
[4067.20 → 4068.52] That people
[4068.52 → 4069.76] In ages past
[4069.76 → 4070.62] Could only
[4070.62 → 4071.38] Dream about
[4071.38 → 4073.38] Don't take it
[4073.38 → 4073.76] For granted
[4073.76 → 4074.76] Don't ignore
[4074.76 → 4075.32] The Spirit
[4075.32 → 4076.14] The Holy Spirit
[4076.14 → 4077.14] Is available to you
[4077.14 → 4077.80] If you are willing
[4077.80 → 4078.56] To receive him
[4078.56 → 4081.26] Second
[4081.26 → 4082.94] Here's the second question
[4082.94 → 4083.42] For you
[4083.42 → 4083.86] For me
[4083.86 → 4084.32] For us
[4084.32 → 4085.06] As a congregation
[4085.06 → 4086.56] Is the Spirit
[4086.56 → 4087.94] Empowering you
[4087.94 → 4089.86] To live in every way
[4089.86 → 4091.16] For his glory
[4091.16 → 4092.00] And not your own
[4092.00 → 4094.78] Is the Spirit
[4094.78 → 4095.86] Empowering you
[4095.86 → 4097.54] Active in your life
[4097.54 → 4098.72] Enabling you
[4098.72 → 4099.52] To live
[4099.52 → 4100.88] In every way
[4100.88 → 4102.30] For his glory
[4102.30 → 4103.58] And not your own
[4103.58 → 4105.28] You know
[4105.28 → 4105.68] I don't know
[4105.68 → 4106.02] If you know
[4106.02 → 4106.36] Much about
[4106.36 → 4107.02] Track and field
[4107.02 → 4108.48] But in the world
[4108.48 → 4109.32] Of track and field
[4109.32 → 4111.18] A wind assisted
[4111.18 → 4112.50] Sprint or jump
[4112.50 → 4114.04] Is disqualified
[4114.04 → 4115.16] From making
[4115.16 → 4116.32] A lasting imprint
[4116.32 → 4117.70] On the sport
[4117.70 → 4118.20] As far as
[4118.20 → 4118.82] Like a record
[4118.82 → 4120.80] But in the kingdom
[4120.80 → 4121.42] Of God
[4121.42 → 4122.50] It works the other way
[4122.50 → 4124.32] We are disqualified
[4124.32 → 4124.92] From making
[4124.92 → 4126.02] A lasting imprint
[4126.02 → 4126.80] On the world
[4126.80 → 4127.96] If we are not
[4127.96 → 4129.40] Wind assisted
[4129.40 → 4129.98] If we are not
[4129.98 → 4130.88] Spirit assisted
[4130.88 → 4133.24] And self-reliance
[4133.24 → 4134.46] Cripples our ability
[4134.46 → 4135.38] To serve the God
[4135.38 → 4136.00] Who made us
[4136.00 → 4137.24] But the Spirit
[4137.24 → 4137.86] Of God
[4137.86 → 4139.44] Empowers us
[4139.44 → 4140.72] To make a lasting
[4140.72 → 4142.12] Kingdom imprint
[4142.12 → 4143.48] On the world
[4143.48 → 4145.88] So are you open
[4145.88 → 4147.10] To the Holy Spirit
[4147.10 → 4148.48] Empowering you
[4148.48 → 4150.18] To live for his glory
[4150.18 → 4152.04] Friends
[4152.04 → 4152.54] The Holy Spirit
[4152.54 → 4153.10] Is available
[4153.10 → 4154.34] The Holy Spirit
[4154.34 → 4155.02] Is active
[4155.02 → 4156.10] He is within you
[4156.10 → 4157.24] And he is working
[4157.24 → 4158.32] Through you
[4158.32 → 4159.56] To extend
[4159.56 → 4160.40] His ministry
[4160.40 → 4162.24] Of redemption
[4162.24 → 4163.04] And healing
[4163.04 → 4163.80] And peace
[4163.80 → 4165.16] To the whole world
[4165.16 → 4166.80] Let's pray
[4166.80 → 4170.78] We thank you
[4170.78 → 4171.06] Father
[4171.06 → 4172.18] For giving us
[4172.18 → 4173.78] Your eternal spirit
[4173.78 → 4175.80] For coming to fill us
[4175.80 → 4177.18] With the presence
[4177.18 → 4177.80] And the power
[4177.80 → 4178.78] Of your life
[4178.78 → 4180.14] And we ask
[4180.14 → 4180.96] That you would help us
[4180.96 → 4182.06] Lord to walk with you
[4182.06 → 4183.36] As you lead us
[4183.36 → 4184.40] So that we would
[4184.40 → 4185.16] Then just boldly
[4185.16 → 4185.78] Proclaim
[4185.78 → 4187.56] Your wonderful works
[4187.56 → 4188.70] And to live
[4188.70 → 4189.30] For your glory
[4189.30 → 4190.70] We pray in Jesus name
[4190.70 → 4191.74] Amen
[4191.74 → 4197.56] Alright so we're going to

[4202.30 → 4203.06] About the Holy Spirit
[4203.06 → 4203.98] Okay so let's stand

[4226.84 → 4228.44] It's a Redeemer
[4228.44 → 4228.56] Amen

[4305.46 → 4310.46] When I stand in glory,
[4310.46 → 4315.46] I will see His face.
[4316.32 → 4320.46] There I'll serve my King forever
[4321.02 → 4325.46] in an unholy place.
[4325.46 → 4331.20] Thank you, O my Father,
[4331.20 → 4336.20] for giving us your Son,
[4336.20 → 4346.20] and leaving your Spirit to the work on earth is done.

[4389.20 → 4390.20] Amen.
[4390.20 → 4396.06] So, every week we respond to the preaching of God's Word through song and praising Him,
[4396.06 → 4403.26] him and another way we respond is by the giving of our tithes and offerings and this is to do what
[4403.26 → 4410.62] we just saying it's to for the work of god spirit in the world in his ministry to all people and
[4410.62 → 4415.34] especially in our designated offering today is for resonate global mission it's the mission
[4415.34 → 4421.56] sending board of our denomination the Christian reform church both here in North America and
[4421.56 → 4428.52] around the world, and we especially support the Imran family and their work in Egypt so may i
[4428.52 → 4432.24] fight the deacons or whoever to collect our offering this morning

[4591.40 → 4602.22] Please join in uniting our hearts in prayer.
[4602.80 → 4611.80] Dear God, you walked with Adam and Eve like a friend in the cool of the evening.
[4613.20 → 4619.42] The perfect communion was broken but restored in Christ.
[4619.42 → 4624.00] In Jesus, you came to be one of us.
[4625.50 → 4628.78] You showed that we matter to you.
[4630.02 → 4634.66] Thank you. Thank you. Love divine.
[4636.40 → 4638.66] Open our hearts to you.
[4640.18 → 4643.70] When we face evil, comfort us.
[4643.70 → 4653.24] Help us to know that while you visit the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation,
[4653.76 → 4661.38] your love is to thousands of generations who surrender to you in faith.
[4661.38 → 4672.04] You are the father of compassion, the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles,
[4673.04 → 4684.78] so that we in turn can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from you.
[4684.78 → 4689.78] Father, use us in your service.
[4691.22 → 4698.00] We are made in your image wonderfully endowed with the ability to love,
[4698.84 → 4707.42] to show empathy, understanding, respect, to encourage others.
[4707.42 → 4709.42] We are made in your service.
[4709.42 → 4712.08] But we can't do it on our own.
[4713.78 → 4721.04] We need your spirit because we are not only wonderfully endowed,
[4721.70 → 4724.36] we are also deeply flawed.
[4724.36 → 4733.72] On this Pentecost Sunday, send the spirit of Jesus, Father.
[4735.42 → 4742.30] Dwell in me, O blessed spirit, gracious teacher, friend divine,
[4743.30 → 4749.76] for the kingdom work that calls me, O prepare this heart of mine.
[4749.76 → 4755.04] Lord, you have given us a place, a task.
[4756.10 → 4761.82] You have tasked us to resist evil and promote the good.
[4763.50 → 4766.06] Lord, it is a wonderful task.
[4766.42 → 4768.20] It's wonderful to serve you.
[4768.56 → 4771.18] It gives direction and purpose to life.
[4772.58 → 4776.68] Help each person in our congregation, young and old alike,
[4776.68 → 4783.22] to find meaning, the meaning of their life in service to you.
[4784.86 → 4786.22] Help us, Father.
[4787.60 → 4789.94] Lord, have mercy.
[4792.02 → 4796.80] Dear God, we pray for the sick, the weak.
[4800.80 → 4803.40] We think of George Colin.
[4803.40 → 4809.44] Why must George be in the hospital again?
[4811.18 → 4813.56] Has he not suffered enough?
[4815.82 → 4817.14] Be with George.
[4817.84 → 4819.48] Give him your healing.
[4820.92 → 4823.36] You are the great physician.
[4825.58 → 4827.62] Be with Art and Wilma.
[4827.62 → 4834.40] Thank you, Lord, that Grace Krista could return home.
[4836.40 → 4839.12] Support all those who suffer.
[4840.72 → 4846.18] Help them know that earth knows no sorrows' heaven cannot heal.
[4847.10 → 4849.72] The righteous person may have many troubles,
[4850.40 → 4854.10] but the Lord delivers him from them all.
[4854.10 → 4860.92] Thank you for our local church fellowship.
[4861.32 → 4863.24] Thank you for the many volunteers.
[4865.48 → 4869.30] Bless those who have been chosen to minister to us today.
[4870.10 → 4872.50] Endow them with your spirit.
[4873.10 → 4877.02] Unite us in love that the mystery of God,
[4877.02 → 4880.36] namely Christ, be evident among us.
[4884.24 → 4887.56] Lord, we daily see the horrors of the world
[4887.56 → 4890.18] on the six o'clock news.
[4891.48 → 4894.40] Help us know we're not alone.
[4896.24 → 4898.70] You came to be one of us.
[4898.70 → 4903.06] Jesus entered into our brokenness.
[4903.06 → 4908.24] He shared the boundedness of life to the point of death.
[4909.14 → 4916.80] By taking it into himself, he conquered brokenness, even death.
[4918.28 → 4923.96] He launched his kingdom that is not like the kingdom of this earth.
[4923.96 → 4928.98] In your kingdom, the last or first.
[4930.16 → 4932.76] To be great is to be a servant of all.
[4934.70 → 4936.62] Foot washers rule.
[4938.42 → 4941.68] In your kingdom, love is not weakness, but strength.
[4942.34 → 4944.14] Love overcomes the world.
[4944.14 → 4952.26] In weakness and love, it pleases you, God, to manifest your nature.
[4954.10 → 4955.40] In weakness.
[4956.02 → 4956.70] What a mystery.
[4957.44 → 4958.26] On the cross.
[4960.16 → 4964.22] Help us, Lord, to be more like you, to take up our cross.
[4965.56 → 4967.16] Lord, have mercy.
[4967.16 → 4973.04] Dear God, as your creatures, as your sons and daughters,
[4973.22 → 4977.46] we pray this and more, trusting you will answer our prayers
[4977.46 → 4980.68] and that it pleases you to hear our petitions.
[4982.24 → 4986.82] Help us never doubt that goodness will overcome evil.
[4987.44 → 4988.80] Truth, the lie.
[4989.54 → 4991.00] Joy, sorrow.
[4991.00 → 4999.16] In the week ahead, let every word said to us or against us
[4999.16 → 5005.06] be returned with words of love, words of encouragement,
[5005.98 → 5008.52] not anger or revenge,
[5009.16 → 5013.22] that your name may be honoured through us.
[5014.40 → 5017.12] May each of us know deeply, personally,
[5017.12 → 5019.64] that in life and in death,
[5020.36 → 5021.90] we are not our own,
[5022.52 → 5025.86] but belong in body and in spirit
[5025.86 → 5029.20] to our faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[5030.34 → 5034.50] Walk with us as you walked with Adam and Eve.
[5036.10 → 5037.16] Restore us.
[5038.74 → 5040.82] Glory be to the Father
[5040.82 → 5042.60] and to the Son
[5042.60 → 5044.26] and to the Holy Spirit
[5044.26 → 5046.84] as it was in the beginning,
[5047.04 → 5047.68] is now,
[5047.82 → 5049.04] and ever will be.
[5049.82 → 5050.24] Amen.
[5050.24 → 5050.42] Amen.
[5065.30 → 5066.30] Please rise.
[5066.30 → 5072.58] And right after our benediction
[5072.58 → 5073.50] and our final song,
[5073.66 → 5075.24] please do join us for a time of fellowship
[5075.24 → 5076.82] in the fellowship hall,
[5076.92 → 5077.68] through the doors there.
[5078.30 → 5079.68] And now would you lift your hands
[5079.68 → 5081.02] to receive the blessing of God.
[5082.66 → 5084.16] May the God of hope
[5084.16 → 5087.00] fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
[5087.66 → 5089.76] so that by the power of the Holy Spirit
[5089.76 → 5091.66] may abound in hope.
[5092.16 → 5092.50] Amen.
[5092.50 → 5092.62] Amen.
[5096.30 → 5125.16] Breathe on me, breath of God,
[5125.16 → 5155.14] until my heart is
[5155.14 → 5156.14] is pure,
[5156.14 → 5163.84] until my will is one with yours
[5163.84 → 5169.14] to do and to endure.
[5172.14 → 5177.14] Breathe on me, breath of God,
[5177.14 → 5183.36] so shall I never die,
[5183.36 → 5186.52] God live with you,
[5186.52 → 5190.30] the perfect life
