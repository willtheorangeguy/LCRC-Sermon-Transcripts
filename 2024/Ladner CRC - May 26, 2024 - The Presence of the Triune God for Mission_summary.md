• Trinity Sunday marks the celebration of the one true and living God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
• Understanding the mystery of the Trinity is not required to relate to God or know Him.
• The Easter resurrection series concludes with a passage from John 20:19-23, where Jesus commissions his disciples to go on mission after sending them peace.
• The speaker reflects on a passage from the Bible and prays for the Holy Spirit to teach them about mission.
• The theme of Trinity Sunday is actually mission, and the church needs to reimagine its missionary identity.
• Leslie Newbigin, a missionary, theologian, and author, helped the church understand its missionary calling in all times and places.
• England was once a Christian country but became a post-Christendom culture with Christianity in decline.
• The West has become a new missionary frontier with challenges and opportunities.
• Jesus reminded his disciples of their mission during a time when they were weak and hiding out of fear.
• Three truths about the mission of the church are:
  • Mission flows from the purposes of the Father
  • It follows the pattern of Jesus the Son
  • It is fueled by the power of the Holy Spirit
• The mission of the church flows from the purposes of God the Father
• Jesus' mission on earth was to save the world, which is now being continued through his disciples
• The mission of the church is not something it creates for itself, but rather it exists for God's mission
• Mission is the very identity of the church and involves bringing about God's kingdom and peace in the world
• The church's role as the hands and feet of Christ
• The church is a foretaste of God's kingdom in the world
• Mission begins with God's heart and purposes, not human efforts
• Mission flows from God's love for the world, exemplified by sending Jesus to save rather than condemn
• The Trinity: mission follows the pattern of the son and is led by the Father's heart for the world
• Jesus' mission is an extension of God's mission
• Jesus left his place of comfort in heaven to be present with people on earth
• Jesus' presence was not just spiritual, but physical and tangible
• Christians are called to follow this same pattern by leaving their places of comfort to be present with others
• The mission of the church is a mission of presence, not distance
• Jesus entered a world like our own with all its problems
• He left his comfort to be present in the real world
• Our pattern for mission is the same as Jesus'
• We are sent to be present with every kind of person and in every situation
• This involves being present in hospitals, schools, with neighbors, etc.
• Being on mission doesn't require moving geographically, but rather being present where we live and work
• The mission of God is happening in the world
• Christians are already missionaries, the gift is theirs and the calling belongs to all of us
• There are different ways to be part of the mission, including going across the world or being present wherever we live
• Following Jesus' pattern of presence, which includes going to be with people and meeting their needs
• Another pattern is that of word and deed, seen in Jesus' life where he met physical needs and proclaimed his identity as the bread of life and light of the world
• The importance of both word (preaching the gospel) and deed (care for people) in spreading the gospel
• An illustration comparing a pair of scissors to emphasizing the need for both blades (word and deed)
• Jesus' mission on forgiveness of sins and its emphasis in the Bible
• Discussion on why Jesus focuses on forgiveness of sins
• The importance of addressing the root issue in human existence
• Why Jesus' message is centered on forgiveness of sins
• The analogy of a doctor diagnosing and treating disease, rather than just symptoms
• The need to address the underlying problem or "disease" in people's lives, rather than just treating surface-level issues
• The speaker discusses the concept of sin as a root problem that separates humanity from God
• Jesus' message is seen as dealing with the root issue through forgiveness, reconciling people with God
• The church has authority to announce forgiveness and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ
• The gospel addresses the human condition of sin, but does not mean simply telling others about Jesus
• The doctor's analogy is used to explain that treating symptoms (hunger, poverty, etc.) while addressing the root disease (sin) is a holistic approach to ministry
• The gospel is about reconciling people to God through Christ and relieving the world's suffering.
• Mission flows from the heart and purposes of God, not human effort.
• The power of the Holy Spirit is necessary for mission and ministry.
• The Holy Spirit is the lifeblood of the church.
• Jesus' mission is fueled by the Holy Spirit and his presence with us.
• Human efforts are insufficient; everything done as a church must be a work of God empowered by the Holy Spirit.
• The importance of living a life with the Holy Spirit
• Understanding the gospel message of forgiveness and salvation through Jesus Christ
• Recognizing one's role in God's mission as part of the church and participating in the triune God's work
• Trusting in God's power and empowerment despite weakness and fragility
• The call to extend God's kingdom and make his people useful for his purposes
