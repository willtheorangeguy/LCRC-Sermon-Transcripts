• The difficulty of forgiving oneself
• Strategies for trying to forgive oneself (silencing the internal judge)

• Facing judgment in a biblical context (Jesus at Simon's dinner party)
• The woman who enters the Pharisee's dinner party is revealed to be a sex worker, and her presence and actions are considered shocking and embarrassing.
• The host, Simon, judges both the woman and Jesus, assuming that Jesus would know she is a sinner and would therefore not allow her to touch him.
• Jesus responds with a parable in which he explains that he has come for those who are sick, not the healthy, and that his presence allows people like the woman to experience forgiveness and repentance.
• The story highlights God's actions of love and forgiveness towards those who are considered outcasts or sinners.
• Jesus' identity and authority to forgive sins
• The woman who was forgiven her debt by Jesus and Simon's role in judging her
• Jesus forgiving debts, including Simon's own sinfulness
• Only God has the right to judge, but Jesus claims that authority
• Judging is not about determining who is more sinful, but rather acknowledging human sinfulness
• Jesus' invitation for people to repent and find forgiveness
• Jesus is the true judge, but also a forgiving and merciful one
• The Pharisees knew God was a judge, but missed that he was also forgiving
• Scriptures attest to God's mercy and forgiveness (e.g. Exodus 34:6-7)
• The woman in the parable sees herself as a sinner and runs to Jesus for forgiveness
• The parable of the two debtors is about the fruit of forgiveness, which is love
• Simon judges that the one who had the greater debt forgiven will love more
• Jesus affirms the woman's actions, saying she has shown him more honor than Simon did
• The relationship between forgiveness and love
• How being forgiven by God leads to greater love for Him
• Why self-forgiveness is not a biblical concept, but rather an acceptance of God's forgiveness
• The significance of Jesus' statement that the woman's sins are forgiven
• Jesus as the forgiving judge who lays down his life for others
• The contrast between human attempts at forgiveness and God's true forgiveness offered through Jesus
• The sins of a woman are forgiven because she sat at Jesus' feet and acknowledged her debt
• A prayer is led asking to be made like this woman, seeking God's forgiveness and mercy over self-forgiveness
• A song of response is sung, "You Are My King", referencing Christ's sacrifice and the believer's freedom from sin
