• The importance of obeying the law to be declared righteous is emphasized.
• Gentiles who do not have the law can still demonstrate knowledge of it through their actions, as the requirements of the law are written on their hearts.
• God's judgment will take place on the day when men's secrets are revealed through Jesus Christ.
• A prayer is offered for the congregation to hear God's voice and receive His blessing.
• The TV show "Parks and Recreation" is mentioned in a tangential discussion about a scene where Venezuelan officials are shocked by the behavior of residents in a small town in Indiana.
• This scene is used as an analogy to illustrate how God's judgment can be swift and immediate, just like the Venezuelan government's response in the scene.
• Paul's emphasis on God's judgment being for all people, including Jews and Gentiles, is highlighted.
• God judges every human being impartially
• The law does not give Jews a special advantage or exemption from judgment
• Gentiles without the law will also be judged for their sin
• Everyone is judged based on whether they obey the law, not just if they have it
• Obedience to the law is what makes someone righteous in God's sight, not just hearing the law.
• Generators and preparedness for emergencies
• Importance of preparation vs. possession of knowledge/law
• God's fairness in judging both those with and without the law
• Natural law and humanity's innate knowledge of right and wrong
• The relationship between God's law and human conscience/truth
• Total depravity means every part of human nature is tainted by sin, not that people are completely bad.
• Sin affects every aspect of human life, including body, mind, emotions, and will.
• Humans reject God and worship idols, but also exhibit kindness and generosity due to being made in God's image.
• Human conscience will accuse us on the day of judgment for our failure to live according to God's law.
• There is no alternate route to salvation apart from Christ; we are unable to keep God's requirements.
• God is fair in his dealings with humanity, judging everyone through Jesus Christ.
