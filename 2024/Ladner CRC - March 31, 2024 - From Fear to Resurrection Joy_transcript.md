[294.32 --> 296.32]  Good morning to you all.
[296.32 --> 302.32]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church on this sunny Easter morning.
[302.32 --> 304.32]  My name is Jason Truel.
[304.32 --> 308.32]  I'm a pastor here and it is my joy to lead us in worship this morning.
[308.32 --> 314.32]  If you are visiting this morning, we are so glad that you are with us.
[314.32 --> 318.32]  And Easter is one of the best days to be in church.
[318.32 --> 325.32]  Because on Easter we celebrate what is at the very heart of the Christian faith.
[325.32 --> 331.32]  That Christ who died on the cross is no longer dead.
[331.32 --> 333.32]  But he has risen.
[333.32 --> 335.32]  He is not in the tomb.
[335.32 --> 337.32]  He is alive.
[337.32 --> 353.32]  We celebrate today because Jesus' resurrection, his conquering of death, is the beginning of all sad things, all broken things in the world coming untrue.
[353.32 --> 363.32]  So I am going to ask if you would stand and join in the Easter acclamation, which will be our call to worship this morning.
[363.32 --> 372.32]  And just a reminder, before we say this, this is normally said in a full voice.
[372.32 --> 373.32]  Okay?
[373.32 --> 375.32]  Are you ready?
[375.32 --> 378.32]  Christ is risen!
[378.32 --> 381.32]  Christ is risen indeed.
[381.32 --> 382.32]  Hallelujah.
[382.32 --> 383.32]  Hallelujah.
[383.32 --> 384.32]  Let's pray.
[384.32 --> 392.32]  O Father, we praise you because you have resurrected our Lord Jesus Christ.
[392.32 --> 402.32]  We thank you that Jesus is alive, sitting at your right hand and delighting in the praises of his people.
[402.32 --> 412.32]  And more than just himself raising, Lord, he has made the way for all who put their faith in him to rise from their own spiritual death.
[412.32 --> 423.32]  Thank you, Lord, that you have transferred us through Christ from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.
[423.32 --> 430.32]  O Lord, we are in awe of this Jesus who trampled death by death.
[430.32 --> 432.32]  It is in his name we pray.
[432.32 --> 433.32]  Amen.
[433.32 --> 438.32]  Here, God's greeting to us this morning from 1 Peter 1, verse 3.
[438.32 --> 445.32]  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[445.32 --> 454.32]  In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[454.32 --> 457.32]  As God has called us, he has welcomed us.
[457.32 --> 462.32]  Let's turn and greet those around you saying, Christ is risen.
[462.32 --> 463.32]  Go ahead.
[463.32 --> 468.32]  Back to bar music, Christ at OFFCREGEN.
[468.32 --> 470.32]  It's the time I comm´t.
[470.32 --> 471.32]  Just in his great mercy.
[471.32 --> 472.32]  Yes?
[472.32 --> 476.32]  The amount of time you need to receive...
[477.32 --> 478.32]  You, my?
[478.32 --> 481.32]  I have received voices from please, the Juan.

[491.32 --> 515.86]  All right, and let's sing about this wonderful news.
[521.32 --> 536.98]  All in the grave he lay, Jesus my Savior.
[536.98 --> 548.02]  Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[548.02 --> 556.72]  Up from the grave he arose, with a mighty triumph for his foes.
[557.10 --> 565.64]  He arose a winter from the dark domain, and he lives forever with his saints to reign.
[566.02 --> 574.40]  He arose, he arose, hallelujah, Christ arose.
[574.40 --> 581.40]  All right, and let's sing about this wonderful news.

[691.86 --> 694.10]  Day 17
[694.10 --> 697.70]  Question, how does Christ's resurrection benefit us?
[699.46 --> 702.12]  First, by his resurrection
[702.12 --> 704.68]  He has overcome death
[704.68 --> 707.54]  So that he might make us share
[707.54 --> 710.82]  In righteousness he obtained from us
[710.82 --> 712.18]  By his death
[712.18 --> 715.62]  Second, by his power
[715.62 --> 719.62]  He too are many days to live in life
[719.62 --> 722.82]  Third, Christ's resurrection
[722.82 --> 725.36]  Is a sure revenge to us
[725.36 --> 727.56]  Our blessed resurrection
[727.56 --> 733.04]  And let's stand again for living hope
[733.04 --> 747.18]  How great the chasm
[747.18 --> 751.04]  That lay between us
[751.04 --> 753.52]  How high the mountain
[753.52 --> 757.28]  I could not climb
[757.28 --> 759.74]  In desperation
[759.74 --> 763.28]  I turned to heaven
[763.28 --> 766.42]  And spoke your name
[766.42 --> 769.28]  Into the night

[778.98 --> 781.28]  Of my soul

[795.28 --> 797.28]  gems

[1223.64 --> 1225.64]  Okay, so...
[1225.64 --> 1235.64]  Okay, so...
[1235.64 --> 1237.64]  Wait.
[1237.64 --> 1239.64]  Not yet, not yet.
[1239.64 --> 1241.64]  You're next, Briston.
[1241.64 --> 1243.64]  You're next.
[1243.64 --> 1245.64]  You're next, Briston.
[1245.64 --> 1247.64]  You're next.
[1247.64 --> 1248.64]  You're next.
[1248.64 --> 1249.64]  He's very excited.
[1249.64 --> 1250.64]  Okay.
[1250.64 --> 1265.64]  So, let me introduce you to Janet, Teresa, Joseph, Helen, Amy, Sarah, and Gavin.
[1265.64 --> 1266.64]  Yeah.
[1266.64 --> 1267.64]  Yeah.
[1267.64 --> 1268.64]  Um...
[1268.64 --> 1272.64]  So, we are welcoming them into membership today.
[1272.64 --> 1273.64]  Okay.
[1273.64 --> 1274.64]  ...
[1274.64 --> 1278.64]  ...
[1278.64 --> 1281.64]  And this is a very exciting time in our church.
[1281.64 --> 1282.64]  ...
[1282.64 --> 1285.64]  ...
[1285.64 --> 1294.64]  Because these new members have been Nancy's co-workers and partners in the ministry that she has been doing.
[1294.64 --> 1296.64]  ...
[1296.64 --> 1299.64]  ...
[1299.64 --> 1301.64]  ...
[1301.64 --> 1303.64]  ...
[1303.64 --> 1304.64]  ...
[1304.64 --> 1306.64]  ...
[1306.64 --> 1307.64]  ...
[1307.64 --> 1309.64]  ...
[1309.64 --> 1325.96]  They've been through the membership class, and our pastoral team, the elders, we have heard all their testimonies.
[1326.04 --> 1331.70]  They have some amazing testimonies, and I'd love for you to get a chance to hear them somehow one day.
[1339.64 --> 1345.98]  And one of the things that we talk about in a membership class is, what does it mean to be a member of a church?
[1346.78 --> 1352.42]  In this meeting, we talked about what does it mean to be a member of a church?
[1352.94 --> 1359.52]  In our culture today, we like to keep our options open. We don't like to commit to things.
[1359.52 --> 1368.72]  In our culture today, we want to make our own choices. We don't want to make any choice for the purpose.
[1369.50 --> 1375.68]  And so it can be a little counterintuitive when it comes to something like church membership.
[1375.68 --> 1392.74]  But becoming a member of a church is to say that I believe that God has brought me to this local church, and that this is my spiritual family.
[1393.60 --> 1405.56]  And just like in any family, when you belong to a family, you're saying, these are my people.
[1405.68 --> 1414.96]  And just like in any family, you will want to spend time together.
[1415.52 --> 1422.64]  You will want to love and serve and care for one another, and seek to grow in Christ together.
[1422.64 --> 1435.02]  So that is what church membership is all about.
[1435.02 --> 1444.06]  And so, for each one of you, you have all been baptized before at different churches, at different times and places.
[1444.90 --> 1449.88]  But today, it is our joy to welcome you as members of this congregation.
[1449.88 --> 1469.30]  And we are so thankful that the Lord has brought each of you into our fellowship for His glory and for the good and the edifying of all of us.
[1469.30 --> 1489.62]  And so, I'm going to invite you now to affirm your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and express your commitment and your desire to become part of this church.
[1489.62 --> 1497.62]  So, I'm going to invite you to confirm your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and express your commitment and your love.
[1497.62 --> 1498.06]  Okay.
[1498.06 --> 1501.24]  So, we'll have two vows for you to take.
[1502.02 --> 1505.76]  Do you affirm once again that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior?
[1506.36 --> 1510.14]  That the Bible is God's word, revealing Christ and His redemption?
[1510.74 --> 1513.46]  And that the teachings of this church reflect this revelation?
[1513.46 --> 1518.74]  Do you confirm that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior?
[1519.10 --> 1522.30]  If the Bible is God, it is the Lord and Savior.
[1522.70 --> 1525.58]  This teaching of the church has reflected this revelation?
[1527.24 --> 1527.60]  Yes.
[1528.52 --> 1529.00]  Okay.
[1529.18 --> 1529.84]  You all heard, right?
[1530.18 --> 1530.70]  Okay.
[1530.88 --> 1531.48]  Good.
[1532.80 --> 1541.34]  And do you promise to join with us, sharing your gifts in our worship and fellowship and in the mission God has given us in the world?
[1541.34 --> 1541.78]  Yes.
[1542.68 --> 1547.34]  You promise to join with us, share your grace, share your gift, share your gift, share your gift, share your gift, share your gift in the world?
[1547.34 --> 1547.84]  Yes.
[1547.84 --> 1547.94]  Yes.
[1551.94 --> 1553.66]  All right.
[1553.86 --> 1554.16]  Excellent.
[1554.88 --> 1560.96]  Now, I have a vow for all of you to make because when you become a member of a church, you're joining a family.
[1561.08 --> 1562.56]  And so, let's all stand together.
[1563.76 --> 1563.90]  Okay.
[1564.42 --> 1566.72]  And I'm going to ask you to make this vow.
[1566.72 --> 1576.02]  Do you, church, promise to receive these brothers and sisters in love, support them with your fellowship and prayers?
[1578.12 --> 1578.98]  And there's more.
[1579.48 --> 1579.90]  Sorry.
[1580.26 --> 1580.74]  Next slide.
[1583.44 --> 1583.88]  Okay.
[1584.06 --> 1584.36]  So, yeah.
[1584.42 --> 1585.50]  Translate the first part for us.
[1585.50 --> 1585.78]  Yes.
[1586.50 --> 1590.38]  Because this is a family, so I ask all of you to have a response.
[1590.72 --> 1596.24]  Do you promise to receive these brothers and sisters in love to join with us and worship and worship to them?
[1597.30 --> 1597.70]  Yes.
[1598.30 --> 1598.62]  Okay.
[1598.84 --> 1603.06]  And recognizing their gifts, invite them into the life and mission of our congregation.
[1603.84 --> 1607.00]  And recognize their gifts, invite them to join with us in the life and mission of our congregation.
[1607.00 --> 1608.00]  And recognize their gifts, invite them to live and life and mission of our congregation.
[1608.00 --> 1608.68]  Ready?
[1608.94 --> 1609.62]  We do.
[1610.18 --> 1611.50]  God help us.
[1611.86 --> 1612.20]  All right.
[1612.30 --> 1612.72]  Thank you.
[1612.78 --> 1613.36]  You may be seated.
[1617.92 --> 1618.44]  All right.
[1619.00 --> 1624.76]  So, later, Pastor Nancy has prepared some nice gifts for them, and they'll do that later after the service.
[1625.04 --> 1628.20]  But right now, let me pray and give glory to God.
[1628.54 --> 1629.26]  Let's join in prayer.
[1629.26 --> 1632.94]  Our Heavenly Father, we praise you.
[1633.12 --> 1639.52]  You are the God who brings people from every tongue, tribe, and nation together to be one body.
[1640.50 --> 1653.76]  Lord, we thank you for bringing each of these brothers and sisters to come and be a part of this church, to serve, to use their gifts, so that they could love us and that we could love them.
[1653.76 --> 1663.96]  Lord, would you, through their being part of this body, Lord, strengthen and build up your church for your glory and the good of your people.
[1664.14 --> 1665.08]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1665.18 --> 1665.32]  Amen.
[1665.32 --> 1666.32]  Amen.
[1666.32 --> 1666.40]  Amen.
[1667.54 --> 1668.68]  Lord, we thank you for your love.
[1668.94 --> 1671.66]  You are the one who choose from each other.
[1672.00 --> 1675.18]  You bring such brothers and sisters to join us in this family.
[1675.84 --> 1682.26]  We pray for you to be alone to strengthen our strength, to make us love each other.
[1682.50 --> 1684.62]  We pray for you to receive all of your glory.
[1685.08 --> 1687.06]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[1687.20 --> 1687.42]  Amen.
[1688.18 --> 1689.44]  Let's give them a round of applause.
[1689.44 --> 1690.44]  Thank you.
[1695.32 --> 1707.88]  All right, Bristan, we're ready for you.
[1708.96 --> 1709.78]  Come on up.
[1709.90 --> 1717.36]  And so we now will baptize five new believers today.
[1718.16 --> 1719.20]  So come on.
[1719.28 --> 1720.86]  Everyone can come on up together.
[1720.86 --> 1720.96]  Come on up.
[1725.32 --> 1729.52]  All right.
[1733.72 --> 1734.86]  Bristan, do you have your paper?
[1736.96 --> 1737.24]  Okay.
[1743.34 --> 1744.32]  Don't be shy.
[1745.32 --> 1746.06]  We have a high show.
[1746.06 --> 1746.12]  Okay.
[1755.32 --> 1761.84]  So I will say some introduction here.
[1761.84 --> 1762.10]  Yeah.
[1762.96 --> 1763.82]  Introduce them now.
[1764.36 --> 1764.86]  Can you?
[1765.00 --> 1766.58]  You introduce them for us.
[1767.58 --> 1769.64]  So you want them to raise the words?
[1769.64 --> 1770.12]  No, not yet.
[1770.16 --> 1770.46]  Not yet.
[1770.70 --> 1770.98]  Okay.
[1771.32 --> 1771.60]  Okay.
[1771.98 --> 1772.30]  All right.
[1773.76 --> 1775.76]  So this is Bristan.
[1776.16 --> 1776.46]  Hello.
[1776.46 --> 1780.60]  He is nine years old.
[1781.66 --> 1781.92]  Yeah.
[1783.00 --> 1786.44]  And he expressed his willy to be Baptist.
[1787.52 --> 1790.88]  He also joined our baptism class.
[1797.36 --> 1798.32]  Feng Feng?
[1800.86 --> 1802.14]  I'm Fred.
[1802.60 --> 1803.06]  Fred?
[1803.22 --> 1803.60]  Fred.
[1803.82 --> 1804.18]  Fred.
[1804.40 --> 1804.64]  Feng.
[1805.18 --> 1805.30]  Yeah.
[1806.46 --> 1806.86]  Hi.
[1806.98 --> 1807.26]  He is Rose.
[1808.80 --> 1809.04]  Hi.
[1809.60 --> 1810.02]  I'm Rose.
[1819.20 --> 1820.32]  Hi.
[1825.76 --> 1826.32]  Bradley?
[1826.52 --> 1830.96] 費秦?
[1830.98 --> 1835.84]  соответственно Hunter Samuels.
[1835.84 --> 1840.68]  going to be asked one way or another when you come to the church whether or not you have been
[1840.68 --> 1857.72]  baptized. It is just going to come up. And so why does the church promote and practice baptism?
[1857.72 --> 1872.36]  Why is baptism so important? And because if you think of it, if you are kind of looking in from the outside,
[1873.56 --> 1883.04]  like the ritual of baptism is a little bit odd. So what is the meaning of baptism?
[1883.04 --> 1891.54]  So what does the church mean? Well, very simply, in baptism, we remember God's promises.
[1892.36 --> 1902.52]  So in the church, we remember God's promises. God promises by grace alone to wash away our sins by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1902.52 --> 1919.38]  He promises to adopt us into his family, the body of Christ.
[1919.38 --> 1933.48]  He promises to unite us together with Christ in his death and resurrection.
[1933.48 --> 1936.48]  He promises to adopt us.
[1936.48 --> 1938.48]  He promises to adopt us.
[1938.48 --> 1940.48]  He promises to adopt us.
[1940.48 --> 1944.48]  Jeff, do you have another one? Another mic? That's the only mic we got.
[1944.48 --> 1948.48]  Okay. All right. Here, Nancy, maybe you stand over here and use one of these.
[1948.48 --> 1953.48]  Why don't you just use one of those?
[1953.48 --> 1960.48]  All right. We'll try that. Hello.
[1960.48 --> 1970.48]  Okay. And so on Easter Sunday, it has traditionally been a time when the church has done baptisms.
[1970.48 --> 1975.48]  So in the Passover, the tradition of the church has been a gift.
[1975.48 --> 1981.48]  And that is because baptism points to new birth and to the promise of resurrection.
[1981.48 --> 1986.48]  That means the gift of the resurrection means the new life, the new life, the new life.
[1986.48 --> 1996.48]  And so what I would like to do now is invite all of us to profess our faith together using these words of Scripture from Romans chapter 6 and Ephesians 4.
[1996.48 --> 1999.48]  Okay. And we'll read this responsibly.
[1999.48 --> 2006.48]  Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[2006.48 --> 2019.48]  Ready? Then together, we were baptized with him through baptism into death.
[2019.48 --> 2029.48]  Just as the next slide. Just as Christ was raised from the dead, through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
[2029.48 --> 2050.48]  And together, there is one body and one spirit. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.
[2050.48 --> 2059.48]  And so, for you all, you have heard the good news of the gospel, and you have put your faith in Jesus for salvation.
[2059.48 --> 2064.48]  You may have heard the gospel, and you are willing to accept Jesus Christ.
[2064.48 --> 2071.48]  And therefore, before God and all of us, I ask you to profess your faith in Jesus Christ.
[2071.48 --> 2078.48]  So, in the Lord, I ask you to confirm your faith in the Lord.
[2078.48 --> 2080.48]  I ask you to say, and we'll have them up here.
[2080.48 --> 2087.48]  Okay. So first, do you renounce sin and the power of evil in your life and in the world?
[2087.48 --> 2092.48]  Do you want to accept the power of evil and in the world?
[2092.48 --> 2094.48]  If so, say, I do.
[2094.48 --> 2101.48]  Okay. Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior?
[2101.48 --> 2106.48]  Do you want to turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior?
[2106.48 --> 2108.48]  I do.
[2108.48 --> 2109.48]  Okay.
[2109.48 --> 2117.48]  Will you be a faithful member of this congregation and through worship and service, seek to advance God's kingdom here and throughout the world?
[2117.48 --> 2124.48]  Do you want to become the忠实 members of the church and through the prayer and worship to try to expand the kingdom of the Lord,
[2124.48 --> 2127.48]  whether it's in this place or in the world.
[2127.48 --> 2129.48]  Okay.
[2129.48 --> 2137.48]  And do you promise to accept the spiritual guidance of this church, to walk in the spirit of Christian love with this congregation,
[2137.48 --> 2142.48]  and to seek those things that make for unity, purity, and peace?
[2142.48 --> 2147.48]  Do you promise to accept the spiritual guidance of the church and with the worship of the church,
[2147.48 --> 2155.48]  to worship the Jesus Christ, and to seek those things that help to unity, purity, and peace?
[2155.48 --> 2164.48]  Okay. All right. And so one more vow for you all to make. Please rise again.
[2164.48 --> 2171.48]  And we are going to read the whole English first, and then we're going to go back the slide, Doug, and we'll read the Chinese.
[2171.48 --> 2174.48]  Then we'll try to do this better the second time.
[2174.48 --> 2175.48]  Okay.
[2175.48 --> 2183.48]  Do you, the people of the Lord, promise to receive these here baptized into your fellowship as members of the body of Christ?
[2183.48 --> 2190.48]  And do you promise to encourage them in the Christian faith and help them in doing the work of the Lord?
[2190.48 --> 2191.48]  Now in Chinese.
[2191.48 --> 2207.48]  Do you promise to receive these people of the Lord, who will be in the church, and help them to take the Lord?
[2207.48 --> 2208.48]  Okay. Ready?
[2208.48 --> 2211.48]  Yes, we do.
[2211.48 --> 2214.48]  Thank you very much. Who made these slides? I did. I'm sorry.
[2214.48 --> 2216.48]  Go ahead. Have a seat.
[2218.48 --> 2224.48]  All right. Let's pray this prayer of thanksgiving to God. Let's pray together.
[2224.48 --> 2231.48]  Heavenly Father, we praise you because you are the author and the giver of life.
[2231.48 --> 2238.48]  We thank you, Lord, for the wonderful gift of baptism.
[2238.48 --> 2254.48]  In this water, you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death, that we are raised to share in his resurrection, and we are being renewed by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2254.48 --> 2261.48]  This water is the Holy Spirit that gave us to the dead and the dead and the dead and the dead.
[2261.48 --> 2264.48]  We can renew in this water in the Holy Spirit.
[2264.48 --> 2267.48]  We pray that your Holy Spirit would be present with us now.
[2267.48 --> 2271.48]  We pray that your Holy Spirit would be present with us now.
[2271.48 --> 2284.48]  So that this water would not be a mere symbol, but would be a sign and seal of the true spiritual cleansing and renewal that you have already done in the hearts of these brothers and sisters.
[2284.48 --> 2303.48]  Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit would not only be a sign of the true spiritual cleansing and the dead and the dead and the dead and the dead and the dead.
[2304.48 --> 2313.48]  So to you, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be all honor and glory, praise now and forever. Amen.
[2314.48 --> 2321.48]  Do all glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory, praise now and glory.
[2321.48 --> 2322.48]  Okay.
[2322.48 --> 2333.48]  So each one of these brothers and sisters have prepared a special Bible verse that they will share.
[2334.48 --> 2339.48]  And so they'll share their verse and then we will baptize each one of them.
[2339.48 --> 2341.48]  Okay, Briston, we're going to try this microphone.
[2341.48 --> 2342.48]  Test test.
[2342.48 --> 2343.48]  Okay.
[2343.48 --> 2344.48]  Hold it.
[2344.48 --> 2345.48]  Are you going to read it for us?
[2345.48 --> 2346.48]  Yeah.
[2346.48 --> 2347.48]  Okay, go for it.
[2347.48 --> 2348.48]  Hello.
[2348.48 --> 2350.48]  Just say your name and then read your verse.
[2350.48 --> 2351.48]  Hello.
[2351.48 --> 2352.48]  My name is Briston Wong.
[2352.48 --> 2356.48]  I'll read the verse Proverbs 1-7.
[2356.48 --> 2357.48]  The fear of Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[2357.48 --> 2358.48]  A fool despite wisdom and instruction.
[2358.48 --> 2359.48]  Okay.
[2359.48 --> 2360.48]  Briston Wong.
[2360.48 --> 2361.48]  Okay.
[2361.48 --> 2362.48]  Briston Wong.
[2362.48 --> 2363.48]  Okay.
[2363.48 --> 2364.48]  So Briston, here I'll put this here.
[2364.48 --> 2394.48] 
[2394.48 --> 2395.48]  Okay.
[2395.48 --> 2396.48]  Okay.
[2396.48 --> 2397.48]  And we'll baptize you.
[2397.48 --> 2398.48]  Okay.
[2398.48 --> 2399.48]  Okay.
[2399.48 --> 2400.48]  Okay.
[2400.48 --> 2405.48]  Briston, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[2405.48 --> 2406.48]  Amen.
[2406.48 --> 2407.48]  Amen.
[2407.48 --> 2408.48]  Amen.
[2408.48 --> 2409.48]  Okay, there you go.
[2409.48 --> 2410.48]  You can wait up here for this.
[2410.48 --> 2411.48]  Okay.
[2411.48 --> 2412.48]  And Fred.
[2412.48 --> 2413.48]  Hi.
[2413.48 --> 2415.48]  I am Fred.
[2415.48 --> 2437.92]  I have específic
[2437.92 --> 2439.92]  Thank you.
[2443.92 --> 2445.52]  All right.
[2445.62 --> 2449.44]  So Fred's verse is Genesis 1, verse 28.
[2450.34 --> 2452.14]  God blessed them and said to them,
[2452.34 --> 2454.58]  be fruitful and increase in number.
[2455.18 --> 2456.60]  Fill the earth and subdue it.
[2457.16 --> 2459.88]  Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky
[2459.88 --> 2462.80]  and over every living creature that moves on the ground.
[2467.92 --> 2469.96]  Don't want the water, the microphone in the water.
[2470.28 --> 2470.98]  Will you hold that for me?
[2471.80 --> 2472.22]  Okay, yeah.
[2473.02 --> 2473.56]  All right.
[2473.82 --> 2474.28]  Go ahead, Fred.
[2474.34 --> 2474.74]  You can kneel.
[2479.16 --> 2481.54]  Fred, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2482.16 --> 2484.02]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2484.70 --> 2485.02]  Amen.
[2485.02 --> 2499.42]  You might need to switch pillows here halfway through.
[2499.66 --> 2500.44]  I'll turn it over.
[2501.04 --> 2502.10]  See how that does.
[2502.56 --> 2502.70]  Okay.
[2505.58 --> 2506.18]  Hi.
[2506.44 --> 2508.30]  My name is Rose.
[2508.30 --> 2538.28]  I love you.
[2538.30 --> 2539.30]  Okay.
[2539.30 --> 2539.98]  Okay.
[2541.42 --> 2541.74]  Okay.
[2541.74 --> 2541.86]  Okay.
[2544.32 --> 2544.88]  Okay.
[2544.98 --> 2549.90]  So Rose, her verse is Acts 2, verses 24 and 26.
[2550.74 --> 2552.24]  But God raised him from the dead,
[2553.10 --> 2554.84]  freeing him from the agony of death,
[2555.08 --> 2558.46]  because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
[2559.10 --> 2561.72]  Therefore, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[2562.40 --> 2564.70]  My body also will rest in hope.
[2565.62 --> 2567.54]  It's a great verse on this Easter day.
[2568.30 --> 2568.94]  Okay.
[2569.44 --> 2569.60]  Here.
[2570.04 --> 2570.74]  Put that for me.
[2579.14 --> 2581.36]  Rose, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2581.78 --> 2583.44]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2584.04 --> 2584.34]  Amen.
[2584.36 --> 2585.48]  Let's go.
[2585.48 --> 2585.76]  Okay.
[2586.66 --> 2587.10]  Okay.
[2587.62 --> 2588.48]  Right.
[2590.92 --> 2591.02]  Okay.
[2595.00 --> 2595.14]  Okay.
[2595.14 --> 2600.14]  二
[2600.14 --> 2602.14]  我叫 Finee-liel
[2602.14 --> 2605.14]  我最喜欢的经文是《马太福音》
[2605.14 --> 2608.14] 第六章二十六
[2608.14 --> 2609.14] 三十四
[2609.14 --> 2610.14]  二十六
[2610.14 --> 2612.14]  你们看那天上的飞鸟
[2612.14 --> 2614.14] 也不重 也不收
[2614.14 --> 2617.14]  也不积蓄在仓里
[2617.14 --> 2620.14]  你们在天父尚且养活它
[2620.14 --> 2624.14]  你们不比飞鸟贵重得多吗
[2624.14 --> 2644.78]  So Fanny's verse is Matthew 6, 26 and 34.
[2644.78 --> 2646.76]  Look at the birds of the air.
[2647.32 --> 2650.26]  They do not sow or reap or store or weigh in barns,
[2650.56 --> 2652.34]  and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[2652.34 --> 2654.70]  Are you not much more valuable than they?
[2655.42 --> 2657.24]  Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,
[2657.74 --> 2659.46]  for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[2660.10 --> 2662.00]  Each day has trouble of its own.
[2676.00 --> 2678.24]  Fanny, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2678.66 --> 2680.22]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2680.22 --> 2680.86]  Amen.
[2682.34 --> 2682.58]  Okay.
[2687.36 --> 2687.84]  Okay.
[2689.40 --> 2689.76]  Okay.
[2693.60 --> 2694.08]  Okay.
[2696.52 --> 2698.74]  So is Raylan going to share?
[2699.46 --> 2699.72]  Okay.
[2700.18 --> 2700.36]  Yeah.
[2700.36 --> 2700.42]  Yeah.
[2706.78 --> 2709.22]  What do you think?
[2709.22 --> 2711.18]  Just the verse?
[2712.32 --> 2713.00]  Old testimony?
[2718.00 --> 2724.24]  So we're going to allow Raylan here to share just a short testimony with all of us today.
[2724.24 --> 2727.30]  Thanks.
[2727.30 --> 2728.36]  Thank you.
[2731.64 --> 2746.38]  So we have some examples.
[2746.38 --> 2748.38]  Jesus said,
[2748.38 --> 2750.38]  If there are people who want to follow me,
[2750.38 --> 2752.38]  then be careful.
[2752.38 --> 2754.38]  Take his hand and take his hand.
[2754.38 --> 2758.38]  He will take his witness to his English.
[2758.38 --> 2760.38]  When we come back to him,
[2760.38 --> 2763.38]  he will share with you in the Chinese.
[2763.38 --> 2765.38]  So he will only use English.
[2776.38 --> 2780.38]  In the book of Matthew chapter 16 verse 21,
[2780.38 --> 2782.38]  it is written,
[2782.38 --> 2784.38]  From that time on,
[2784.38 --> 2788.38]  Jesus began to explain to his disciples
[2788.38 --> 2791.38]  that he must go to Jerusalem
[2791.38 --> 2795.38]  and suffer many things at the hands of the elders,
[2795.38 --> 2798.38]  the chief priests, and the teachers of the law.
[2798.38 --> 2803.38]  He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
[2803.38 --> 2808.38]  Having encountered this verse during visits to churches
[2808.38 --> 2812.38]  and through multiple readings of the Bible,
[2812.38 --> 2817.38]  I wouldn't say been unfamiliar with this verse.
[2817.38 --> 2820.38]  In the past, I found it challenging
[2820.38 --> 2825.38]  to fully embrace its significance.
[2825.38 --> 2830.38]  Even Peter, who boldly confessed to Jesus,
[2830.38 --> 2833.38]  you're the Messiah, the son of the living God.
[2833.38 --> 2837.38]  Struggle to accept these happy words.
[2837.38 --> 2840.38]  Peter took him aside and rebuked him saying,
[2840.38 --> 2844.38]  Never Lord, this shall never happen to you.
[2844.38 --> 2848.38]  I emphasize with Peter's emotional turmoil
[2848.38 --> 2852.38]  as he grappled with God's prophetic plan.
[2852.38 --> 2857.38]  Similar to Peter, my trust in the lost divine purpose
[2857.38 --> 2862.38]  hesitated with uncertainty.
[2862.38 --> 2869.38]  Now I recognize that God's plan accomplish everything.
[2869.38 --> 2872.38]  And that Jesus, the son of God,
[2872.38 --> 2878.38]  will fulfill his mission by sacrificing his life to save man.
[2878.38 --> 2882.38]  But there was not just suffering and death.
[2882.38 --> 2888.38]  The suffering of the cross will be followed by glorious resurrection
[2888.38 --> 2891.38]  and the freedom of man from their sins.
[2891.38 --> 2898.38]  Then Jesus said to his disciples in Matthew 16, 24,
[2898.38 --> 2904.38]  whoever wants to be my disciples must deny themselves,
[2904.38 --> 2907.38]  take up their cross and follow me.
[2907.38 --> 2912.38]  The concept of denying oneself amazed me.
[2912.38 --> 2915.38]  How far does this denial extend?
[2915.38 --> 2921.38]  And what does it truly mean to carry on our own cross?
[2921.38 --> 2928.38]  Despite this uncertain taste, I am committed to following Jesus
[2928.38 --> 2934.38]  with obedience, trusting his path leads to redemption
[2934.38 --> 2936.38]  and an internal life.
[2936.38 --> 2937.38]  Thank you.
[2937.38 --> 2938.38]  Thank you.
[2944.38 --> 2946.38]  So I love Raelynn's testimony.
[2946.38 --> 2950.38]  When she realized Jesus actually calls us to carry our cross
[2950.38 --> 2951.38]  and follow him.
[2951.38 --> 2952.38]  So we should be a little careful.
[2952.38 --> 2954.38]  Like what is he actually asking?
[2954.38 --> 2957.38]  But then, as Raelynn said, to just step forward in faith and say,
[2957.38 --> 2959.38]  I'm willing to follow him.
[2959.38 --> 2962.38]  And so, thank you for your testimony.
[2962.38 --> 2964.38]  And, yep, go ahead.
[2964.38 --> 2965.38]  You can...
[2970.38 --> 2973.38]  So Raelynn, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2973.38 --> 2975.38]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2975.38 --> 2976.38]  Amen.
[2976.38 --> 2977.38]  Amen.
[2977.38 --> 2978.38]  Amen.
[2978.38 --> 2979.38]  Thank you.
[2979.38 --> 2980.38]  Thank you.
[2980.38 --> 2981.38]  Thank you.
[2981.38 --> 2982.38]  Thank you.
[2982.38 --> 2983.38]  Thank you.
[2983.38 --> 2984.38]  Thank you.
[2984.38 --> 2985.38]  Thank you.
[2985.38 --> 2986.38]  Thank you.
[2986.38 --> 2987.38]  Thank you.
[2987.38 --> 2988.38]  Thank you.
[2988.38 --> 2989.38]  Thank you.
[2989.38 --> 3004.38]  And so, let's pray.
[3004.38 --> 3005.38]  We give thanks to God.
[3005.38 --> 3010.38]  Father, we thank you so much that you make us new creations
[3010.38 --> 3013.38]  through Jesus Christ, through your grace alone.
[3013.38 --> 3014.38]  Thank you.
[3014.38 --> 3015.38]  Thank you.
[3015.38 --> 3016.38]  Thank you.
[3016.38 --> 3018.38]  Thank you.
[3018.38 --> 3019.38]  Thank you, thank you.
[3019.38 --> 3021.38]  Through your love and our grace,
[3021.38 --> 3023.38]  our grace and our grace,
[3023.38 --> 3026.38]  our God, our God.
[3026.38 --> 3028.38]  Would you bless and strengthen these brothers and sisters
[3028.38 --> 3034.18]  brothers and sisters and help them to follow Christ as your disciples until your kingdom comes.
[3034.28 --> 3035.84]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3049.42 --> 3055.42]  And here's our declaration. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the only king and head of the
[3055.42 --> 3063.30]  church, Briston, Fred, Rose, Raelynn, and Fanny, are now received into the visible membership of the church
[3063.30 --> 3068.68]  and engaged to confess Christ and be God's faithful servants. Amen.
[3069.24 --> 3069.64]  Amen.
[3069.64 --> 3069.72]  Amen.
[3073.72 --> 3078.80]  Thank you.
[3085.42 --> 3097.22]  Let's stand and sing this song of testimony, telling of God's plan to come from heaven,
[3097.22 --> 3101.92]  to take our place, and rise from the dead.
[3101.92 --> 3119.10]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3120.10 --> 3123.50]  Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[3123.50 --> 3135.30]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[3136.26 --> 3147.24]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way, from the earth to the cross, my debt to pay,
[3147.24 --> 3152.64]  from the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sun.
[3152.96 --> 3155.68]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3158.12 --> 3161.12]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3163.50 --> 3166.98]  Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[3166.98 --> 3169.52]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[3169.52 --> 3178.18]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[3179.54 --> 3182.36]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way, from the earth to the cross, my debt to pay,
[3182.36 --> 3194.82]  from the grave to the sky.
[3194.82 --> 3205.80]  Lord, I lift your name all my eyes.
[3205.96 --> 3208.32]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way, from the earth to the cross.
[3208.42 --> 3221.08]  Find death to pay, from the cross to the great, from the grave to the sky, Lord, I lift your name all my eyes.
[3224.82 --> 3225.88]  You may be seated.
[3244.72 --> 3248.36]  Okay, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[3254.82 --> 3278.84]  Do you need a stand?
[3284.82 --> 3286.82]  Thank you.
[3298.04 --> 3299.14]  Getting organized.
[3300.22 --> 3302.24]  So happy Easter again to you all.
[3305.22 --> 3309.30]  So during this Holy Week, we have been on a journey with Jesus.
[3309.30 --> 3313.50]  In the whole of this holy week, we have been on Jesus' journey.
[3313.76 --> 3315.92]  This journey began on Good Friday.
[3317.66 --> 3321.54]  This journey began on Sunday night.
[3322.00 --> 3328.60]  Where on the cross, the deepest trauma and shame that a person could ever experience, Jesus endured.
[3328.60 --> 3344.30]  And Jesus endured the cross in order for us to receive forgiveness and salvation.
[3344.30 --> 3351.30]  耶稣经历了十字架的苦痛,祂是为了让我们得救,拯救,得救赎。
[3351.98 --> 3360.30]  然后就来到了神圣的周六。
[3361.52 --> 3372.30]  在周六,耶稣安睡在坟墓当中。
[3372.30 --> 3376.30]  祂走进了我们最深的苦痛。
[3376.82 --> 3384.30]  现在我们来到了胜利的得胜的主日。
[3385.12 --> 3392.30]  复活节是我们信仰的基石。
[3392.30 --> 3401.30]  我们信仰的基石就是。
[3402.30 --> 3404.30]  耶稣的受死复活。
[3404.30 --> 3418.30]  复活它不是一个故事的结束,而是一个续写。
[3418.30 --> 3432.30]  复活节是新受造的开始,它使一切都更新了。
[3432.30 --> 3450.30]  我们来到今天的经文,在马太福音二十八章一到十节。
[3450.30 --> 3454.30]  这是马太对于复活的描述。
[3454.30 --> 3458.30]  这是马太对于复活的描述。
[3458.30 --> 3459.30]  这是马太对于复活的描述。
[3459.30 --> 3461.74]  And I want to invite us all for just a moment
[3462.76 --> 3467.76]  to go to this place, go to the tomb
[3467.76 --> 3471.30]  through our imaginations as we read.
[3485.50 --> 3486.84]  So I will read for us.
[3486.84 --> 3490.90]  After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week,
[3491.28 --> 3494.36]  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[3496.72 --> 3498.54]  There was a violent earthquake,
[3498.88 --> 3501.52]  for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven
[3501.52 --> 3505.16]  and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[3505.76 --> 3507.18]  His appearance was like lightning
[3507.18 --> 3509.32]  and his clothes were as white as snow.
[3511.00 --> 3513.34]  The guards were so afraid of him
[3513.34 --> 3516.16]  that they shook and became like dead men.
[3516.84 --> 3518.58]  The angel said to the women,
[3518.78 --> 3519.62]  Do not be afraid,
[3520.26 --> 3522.34]  for I know that you are looking for Jesus,
[3522.78 --> 3523.80]  who was crucified.
[3524.44 --> 3525.48]  He is not here.
[3525.62 --> 3528.70]  He has risen, just as he said.
[3529.46 --> 3532.84]  Come and see the place where he lay.
[3533.74 --> 3536.04]  Then go quickly and tell his disciples,
[3536.62 --> 3538.28]  He has risen from the dead
[3538.28 --> 3540.96]  and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[3540.96 --> 3543.20]  There you will see him.
[3543.90 --> 3545.40]  Now I have told you.
[3546.34 --> 3549.54]  So the women hurried away from the tomb,
[3550.32 --> 3552.60]  afraid yet filled with joy,
[3553.04 --> 3555.04]  and ran to tell the disciples.
[3556.18 --> 3558.54]  Suddenly, Jesus met them.
[3559.28 --> 3560.34]  Greetings, he said.
[3561.42 --> 3562.44]  They came to him,
[3563.14 --> 3564.56]  clasped his feet,
[3565.08 --> 3566.00]  and worshipped him.
[3566.00 --> 3568.20]  Then Jesus said to them,
[3568.74 --> 3569.62]  Do not be afraid.
[3570.24 --> 3572.82]  Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee.
[3573.58 --> 3575.10]  There they will see me.
[3576.78 --> 3578.20]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3580.26 --> 3581.72]  Let's come before the Lord in prayer
[3581.72 --> 3583.22]  as we come before his word.
[3583.22 --> 3587.74]  Heavenly Father,
[3587.88 --> 3589.58]  we thank you for your word this morning.
[3593.20 --> 3594.34]  Your word is true,
[3594.48 --> 3596.32]  and you give it to us because you love us.
[3601.22 --> 3603.38]  We pray that you would send your Holy Spirit
[3603.38 --> 3605.26]  to open our eyes, our ears,
[3605.62 --> 3607.10]  our hearts, and our minds
[3607.10 --> 3610.92]  to behold the wonder of what happened
[3610.92 --> 3613.62]  on this day 2,000 years ago
[3613.62 --> 3615.98]  when our Lord was risen from the dead.
[3617.38 --> 3619.26]  We pray that you would send your Holy Spirit
[3619.26 --> 3619.96]  to us.
[3620.68 --> 3621.48]  Open our eyes,
[3621.92 --> 3622.60]  open our ears,
[3622.92 --> 3623.76]  open our hearts,
[3624.28 --> 3625.16]  open our hearts,
[3625.94 --> 3627.18]  open our thoughts,
[3627.84 --> 3629.14]  open our thoughts,
[3629.14 --> 3630.22]  and make us realize that
[3630.22 --> 3632.76]  the all the world had happened in this world.
[3635.28 --> 3637.08]  Lord, would you instruct our hearts
[3637.08 --> 3639.14]  and lead us to faith and joy this morning.
[3639.42 --> 3640.46]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3640.62 --> 3640.82]  Amen.
[3640.92 --> 3642.90]  请你向我们的心说话,
[3643.08 --> 3644.44] 使我们有信心
[3644.44 --> 3647.68] 来让我们在欢喜快乐当中
[3647.68 --> 3648.28] 敬礼你,
[3649.14 --> 3650.68] 奉耶稣基督的名祷告.
[3651.34 --> 3651.66]  Amen.
[3652.42 --> 3654.22]  So we're in this final chapter
[3654.22 --> 3655.78]  in the Gospel of Matthew.
[3656.22 --> 3658.20]  我们来到马太福音的最后一章.
[3659.08 --> 3660.58]  And after Jesus was crucified,
[3661.36 --> 3662.18]  on the third day,
[3662.28 --> 3663.52]  he rose again from the dead.
[3664.38 --> 3665.70]  耶稣被定十架,
[3666.00 --> 3666.66] 三天后,
[3666.84 --> 3667.84] 他受死复活了.
[3667.84 --> 3668.96]  And as we've said,
[3669.06 --> 3671.48]  this belief is the centerpiece of our faith.
[3671.88 --> 3672.62]  就像我们所说,
[3672.94 --> 3674.72] 这是我们基督信仰的核心.
[3675.50 --> 3676.26]  And so this morning,
[3676.34 --> 3678.12]  I want us to look at some of the details
[3678.12 --> 3679.40]  of this story.
[3679.94 --> 3680.70]  And in particular,
[3680.70 --> 3682.76]  I want to draw out four truths
[3682.76 --> 3683.70]  that we observe here.
[3683.96 --> 3684.86]  今天早晨,
[3685.02 --> 3686.42] 我想请大家一起看
[3686.42 --> 3688.66] 这个故事里面的一些细节.
[3689.18 --> 3691.52]  我尤其想谈到的就是
[3691.52 --> 3692.92] 四个事实.
[3693.28 --> 3694.68]  And so this is what they are.
[3695.04 --> 3696.06]  It's that the resurrection
[3696.06 --> 3698.50]  is an event in history.
[3699.30 --> 3701.32]  It is the beginning of a new creation.
[3701.32 --> 3703.34]  It is a gift of grace.
[3704.22 --> 3706.24]  And the resurrection demands a response.
[3707.24 --> 3708.42]  这四个事实就是
[3708.42 --> 3713.56]  复活是历史上所发生的一件事实.
[3714.30 --> 3717.02]  复活代表着一个新创造的开始.
[3717.58 --> 3720.00]  复活是恩典的礼物.
[3720.42 --> 3722.32]  复活需要回应.
[3722.32 --> 3723.96]  So four things,
[3724.10 --> 3726.54]  and we'll look at them briefly this morning.
[3727.10 --> 3728.88]  And these really are important,
[3729.08 --> 3729.98]  beautiful truths.
[3730.16 --> 3731.08]  And so I'm so excited
[3731.08 --> 3732.28]  to share them with you today.
[3733.38 --> 3735.22]  今天早上我们要谈到的这些
[3735.22 --> 3736.34] 都是事实,
[3736.70 --> 3738.46] 而且它是美好的事实.
[3738.84 --> 3740.32]  它对我们是如此的重要,
[3740.48 --> 3741.46] 所以我非常开心
[3741.46 --> 3742.62] 今天与大家分享.
[3743.10 --> 3743.88]  Okay, so first,
[3744.00 --> 3746.58]  the resurrection is an event in history.
[3747.24 --> 3749.02]  首先,复活是历史事件.
[3749.72 --> 3750.70]  Right, and so as Christians,
[3750.70 --> 3752.50]  we do not believe that the resurrection
[3752.50 --> 3755.06]  is a myth or a metaphor.
[3755.86 --> 3758.28]  This is an historical event.
[3759.06 --> 3759.74]  作为基督徒,
[3760.28 --> 3762.90] 我们不相信复活是神话
[3762.90 --> 3764.26] 或者是一个比喻.
[3764.68 --> 3766.62]  我们相信它是一个历史事件.
[3767.22 --> 3768.72]  And the amount of evidence
[3768.72 --> 3770.96]  that points toward the historicity
[3770.96 --> 3771.98]  of Jesus' resurrection
[3771.98 --> 3773.74]  is actually quite large.
[3774.38 --> 3776.46]  有很多的证据可以表明
[3776.46 --> 3779.36] 耶稣的复活是一个历史事件.
[3779.36 --> 3780.74]  We don't have time to go through
[3780.74 --> 3781.54]  all of it this morning,
[3781.78 --> 3782.84]  but I want to point out
[3782.84 --> 3783.88]  just one example
[3783.88 --> 3785.52]  of the kind of evidence
[3785.52 --> 3786.44]  that we have
[3786.44 --> 3787.74]  for the historicity
[3787.74 --> 3788.64]  of the resurrection.
[3789.44 --> 3790.44]  我们没有时间
[3790.44 --> 3791.36] 一一地去查考。
[3792.02 --> 3793.12]  那今天我只想
[3793.12 --> 3794.82] 指出一个例子
[3794.82 --> 3795.72] 来证明
[3795.72 --> 3797.36] 耶稣复活的历史性。
[3797.36 --> 3800.42]  And so you'll notice
[3800.42 --> 3801.62]  in this passage
[3801.62 --> 3803.44]  the role that women play
[3803.44 --> 3805.72]  as the first witnesses
[3805.72 --> 3807.76]  to Jesus' resurrection.
[3807.76 --> 3808.96]  你会发现
[3808.96 --> 3811.68] 在这个圣经当中
[3811.68 --> 3812.60] 描述的是
[3812.60 --> 3816.24] 妇是耶稣复活的第一证人。
[3816.24 --> 3818.02]  So let's look at verse 1.
[3819.02 --> 3820.12]  This is what it says again.
[3820.32 --> 3821.40]  Now after the Sabbath,
[3821.78 --> 3822.48]  toward the dawn
[3822.48 --> 3823.24]  of the first day
[3823.24 --> 3823.72]  of the week,
[3824.24 --> 3825.00]  Mary Magdalene
[3825.00 --> 3826.14]  and the other Mary
[3826.14 --> 3827.96]  went to see the tomb.
[3828.44 --> 3829.16]  第一节说
[3829.16 --> 3830.10]  安息日将近
[3830.10 --> 3831.16] 七日的头一日
[3831.16 --> 3832.28] 天快亮的时候
[3832.28 --> 3833.60] 摩达拉的玛利亚
[3833.60 --> 3834.48] 和那个玛利亚
[3834.48 --> 3835.24] 来看坟墓。
[3835.66 --> 3836.90]  So over and over again,
[3836.98 --> 3838.40]  Matthew uses this language
[3838.40 --> 3839.16]  in this passage
[3839.16 --> 3839.94]  of seeing.
[3839.94 --> 3841.66]  一遍又一遍的
[3841.66 --> 3843.82]  玛太使用看这个词。
[3843.82 --> 3846.70]  So Mary and the other Mary,
[3847.42 --> 3849.38]  they go to the tomb
[3849.38 --> 3850.34]  and they are going
[3850.34 --> 3852.22]  to prepare Jesus' body
[3852.22 --> 3853.06]  for burial.
[3853.76 --> 3855.22]  玛利亚和另一个玛利亚
[3855.22 --> 3857.02] 他们来到坟墓那里
[3857.02 --> 3858.60] 是要为耶稣基督
[3858.60 --> 3859.56] 准备安葬。
[3860.06 --> 3861.72]  And when they arrive,
[3861.84 --> 3863.16]  an angel meets them there.
[3863.70 --> 3864.78]  当他们到来的时候,
[3865.24 --> 3866.52] 那天使在这里
[3866.52 --> 3867.14] 遇到他们。
[3867.14 --> 3868.50]  And look what it says
[3868.50 --> 3869.74]  in verses 5 and 6.
[3871.50 --> 3873.22]  The angel said to the woman,
[3873.22 --> 3874.28]  do not be afraid
[3874.28 --> 3875.64]  for I know that you are looking
[3875.64 --> 3877.28]  for Jesus who was crucified.
[3877.56 --> 3878.42]  He is not here,
[3879.04 --> 3880.02]  he has risen.
[3880.18 --> 3881.02]  Just as he said,
[3881.58 --> 3882.94]  come and see
[3882.94 --> 3884.40]  the place where he lay.
[3884.64 --> 3885.88]  Then go quickly
[3885.88 --> 3887.42]  and tell his disciples.
[3887.42 --> 3888.94]  天使对父女说,
[3889.04 --> 3889.56] 不要害怕。
[3889.76 --> 3890.78] 我知道你们是寻找
[3890.78 --> 3892.10] 那钉十字架的耶稣。
[3892.38 --> 3893.06]  他不在这里。
[3893.30 --> 3894.12] 照他所说的,
[3894.24 --> 3895.02] 已经复活了。
[3895.34 --> 3895.98]  你们来看,
[3896.12 --> 3897.56] 安放在主的地方,
[3897.82 --> 3899.04] 快去告诉他的门徒,
[3899.34 --> 3900.92] 说他从死里复活了。
[3900.92 --> 3902.34]  So notice that these women
[3902.34 --> 3905.66]  are the first chief eyewitnesses
[3905.66 --> 3906.44]  to the resurrection.
[3907.30 --> 3907.94]  看到这里,
[3908.18 --> 3911.10]  妇女是主要的见证人,
[3911.44 --> 3912.20] 耶稣复活的见证人。
[3912.20 --> 3913.52]  They are the first ones
[3913.52 --> 3915.12]  to see the empty tomb,
[3915.60 --> 3916.88]  and then they are sent
[3916.88 --> 3917.94]  to tell others.
[3917.94 --> 3920.64]  他们是第一个看到坟墓是空的,
[3920.82 --> 3922.20] 而且他们被告知
[3922.20 --> 3923.94] 去告诉其他人。
[3923.94 --> 3925.60]  Now the reason this is so important
[3925.60 --> 3928.08]  is because in the ancient world,
[3928.20 --> 3929.08]  in the first century,
[3929.74 --> 3931.70]  women were not regarded
[3931.70 --> 3933.70]  as credible testimony
[3933.70 --> 3935.10]  in a court of law.
[3935.86 --> 3936.34]  I'm sorry.
[3936.80 --> 3938.16]  最重要的一点就是,
[3938.52 --> 3939.50]  在一世纪,
[3939.62 --> 3940.66]  在犹太文化当中,
[3940.76 --> 3941.98]  在当时的文化当中,
[3942.30 --> 3943.30]  妇女的证言
[3943.30 --> 3944.90]  是在法庭上
[3944.90 --> 3946.18]  不被采信的。
[3946.18 --> 3948.34]  No one would believe
[3948.34 --> 3949.16]  the witness
[3949.16 --> 3950.02]  in the testimony
[3950.02 --> 3950.84]  of a woman.
[3951.40 --> 3952.18]  那么一个女人
[3952.18 --> 3952.78] 所说的话,
[3952.98 --> 3953.80] 没有人会相信。
[3954.70 --> 3955.72]  So if this story
[3955.72 --> 3956.72]  was a fabrication,
[3957.18 --> 3957.38]  you know,
[3957.42 --> 3957.90]  if Matthew,
[3958.04 --> 3959.04]  the other gospel writers
[3959.04 --> 3960.84]  were just making this up,
[3961.26 --> 3962.30]  you wouldn't make
[3962.30 --> 3963.66]  your key eyewitness
[3963.66 --> 3964.58]  a woman.
[3965.14 --> 3966.26]  如果这个故事
[3966.26 --> 3967.24] 是一个编造的话,
[3967.58 --> 3968.44]  如果是马太
[3968.44 --> 3969.60] 或其他的这些
[3969.60 --> 3970.70] 福音书的作者,
[3970.96 --> 3972.30] 他们要编一个故事的话,
[3972.62 --> 3974.30] 他们不会让妇女
[3974.30 --> 3975.72] 成为主要的见证人。
[3975.72 --> 3976.62]  Because anyone
[3976.62 --> 3978.22]  would immediately
[3978.22 --> 3979.78]  just be able to dismiss it
[3979.78 --> 3980.08]  and say,
[3980.14 --> 3980.84]  well, no one believes
[3980.84 --> 3981.62]  a woman anyway.
[3982.20 --> 3983.02]  因为任何人
[3983.02 --> 3983.78] 都会马上说,
[3983.88 --> 3984.06]  哎呀,
[3984.14 --> 3984.78] 根本没有人
[3984.78 --> 3986.12] 信妇女说的话。
[3986.12 --> 3986.98]  So the only reason
[3986.98 --> 3987.76]  we would have women
[3987.76 --> 3989.54]  playing such a prominent role
[3989.54 --> 3990.52]  in the scriptures
[3990.52 --> 3992.30]  is because God
[3992.30 --> 3993.04]  chose them.
[3993.68 --> 3993.92]  那么,
[3994.80 --> 3996.28]  唯一合理的解释就是,
[3997.28 --> 3998.58]  妇女能够在这个
[3998.58 --> 3999.30] 福音书当中
[3999.30 --> 4000.70]  起这么重要的作用
[4000.70 --> 4002.10]  是因为上帝
[4002.10 --> 4003.12]  拣选了她们。
[4003.12 --> 4004.66]  People in that culture
[4004.66 --> 4006.34]  would not have chosen them,
[4006.56 --> 4007.22]  but God
[4007.22 --> 4008.92]  would choose them.
[4008.92 --> 4010.42]  在当时的文化中,
[4010.56 --> 4012.24]  人们不会采信女人,
[4012.52 --> 4013.42]  但是上帝
[4013.42 --> 4015.20]  选取了她们。
[4015.20 --> 4016.26]  So the women
[4016.26 --> 4018.10]  are the primary witnesses
[4018.10 --> 4019.36]  to the resurrection
[4019.36 --> 4021.04]  because that's what
[4021.04 --> 4022.06]  really happened.
[4022.06 --> 4023.06]  那么,
[4023.06 --> 4024.54]  妇女作为耶稣
[4024.54 --> 4025.88]  复活的主要见证人
[4025.88 --> 4026.74]  是因为
[4026.74 --> 4029.06]  她真的发生了。
[4029.06 --> 4031.52]  And there are details like this
[4031.52 --> 4032.20]  that are sprinkled
[4032.20 --> 4033.98]  all throughout the gospel accounts
[4033.98 --> 4034.96]  that give it
[4034.96 --> 4036.88]  a mark of authenticity.
[4037.82 --> 4039.54]  那其实在圣经里面
[4039.54 --> 4041.18]  有很多这样的细节
[4041.18 --> 4042.98]  在这个福音书当中
[4042.98 --> 4043.56]  那么,
[4043.62 --> 4044.58]  它都证实了
[4044.58 --> 4046.82]  这件事情的真确性。
[4046.82 --> 4047.38]  Now listen,
[4047.38 --> 4049.08]  we can't prove
[4049.08 --> 4050.96]  that the resurrection happened.
[4051.98 --> 4053.56]  我们没有办法
[4053.56 --> 4055.04]  真的是去证明
[4055.04 --> 4057.18]  这个复活已经发生。
[4057.18 --> 4057.66]  Why not?
[4057.92 --> 4058.86]  Well, it's because
[4058.86 --> 4060.80]  like anything from history,
[4061.38 --> 4063.00]  we can't reproduce it in a lab.
[4063.60 --> 4063.82]  Right?
[4063.86 --> 4065.12]  We are in the realm of history,
[4065.26 --> 4066.24]  not natural science.
[4066.74 --> 4067.54]  那为什么呢?
[4067.70 --> 4068.90]  因为就像历史上发生
[4068.90 --> 4070.12]  其他的事件一样,
[4070.42 --> 4072.72]  我们不能把它放在实验室里
[4072.72 --> 4074.10]  重新复制一遍。
[4074.38 --> 4076.40]  因为我们是在历史的角度
[4076.40 --> 4078.16]  而不是在自然科学。
[4078.16 --> 4080.36]  But that the resurrection happened
[4080.36 --> 4082.24]  as it's recorded in the Gospels
[4082.24 --> 4084.04]  is the best explanation
[4084.04 --> 4086.48]  for the historical evidence that we have.
[4087.28 --> 4090.96]  但是这个确实发生的复活
[4090.96 --> 4095.04]  本身就是一个历史的证明。
[4095.58 --> 4098.46]  The actual physical resurrection of Jesus
[4098.46 --> 4101.20]  is better than any other hypothesis
[4101.20 --> 4102.04]  of what happened.
[4102.68 --> 4105.26]  耶稣基督确实死里复活了
[4105.26 --> 4108.10]  这是比任何的解释都好。
[4108.10 --> 4110.30]  Now the reason I'm telling you this
[4110.30 --> 4112.40]  is just for us to recognize
[4112.40 --> 4115.16]  that you absolutely can be a rational,
[4115.60 --> 4117.48]  intelligent, thoughtful person,
[4118.02 --> 4120.80]  and you can even be a scientifically-minded person,
[4121.02 --> 4123.82]  and yet still believe in the wild hope
[4123.82 --> 4126.20]  that Jesus' body was raised from the dead.
[4126.20 --> 4130.04]  我跟你谈这些的原因就是
[4130.04 --> 4131.54]  我想让你意识到
[4131.54 --> 4134.56]  即便你是一个完全理性的
[4134.56 --> 4136.16]  充满智慧的
[4136.16 --> 4137.86]  善于思考的人
[4137.86 --> 4140.60]  甚至你是有一个科学家的头脑
[4140.60 --> 4142.48]  你仍然可以相信
[4142.48 --> 4145.32]  耶稣基督死而复活了。
[4145.32 --> 4147.36]  You can believe in the resurrection
[4147.36 --> 4149.26]  based on all the historical evidence
[4149.26 --> 4151.32]  and be an intelligent person.
[4151.32 --> 4154.10]  你因着地史的这些
[4154.10 --> 4156.52]  证明而相信耶稣复活
[4156.52 --> 4158.62]  而你仍然可以是一个
[4158.62 --> 4160.32]  理智的智慧的人。
[4160.32 --> 4162.68]  But at the end of the day,
[4162.68 --> 4165.56]  the only thing that will truly convince someone
[4165.56 --> 4168.50]  is the work of God in that person's heart,
[4169.06 --> 4170.90]  bringing them to a knowledge of the truth.
[4171.90 --> 4173.14]  那最重要的是
[4173.14 --> 4177.70]  总有一天,上帝他自己会在人心中做工
[4177.70 --> 4182.16]  使人能够真正的认识真理。
[4182.16 --> 4187.74]  第一点就是
[4187.74 --> 4192.16]  耶稣基督的复活是历史事实。
[4192.16 --> 4194.50]  Now the second thing I want to point out from this passage
[4194.50 --> 4197.36]  is that the resurrection is the beginning of a new creation.
[4198.06 --> 4200.28]  那么第二件事情我想指出的就是
[4200.28 --> 4203.58]  复活是一个新生的开始。
[4204.10 --> 4207.84]  Now each of the four gospels tells us about the resurrection.
[4208.90 --> 4211.50]  四本福音书中都谈到了复活。
[4211.70 --> 4215.14]  And they all share the same basic narrative of what happened.
[4215.14 --> 4219.18]  他们都讲到了最基本的是到底发生了什么。
[4219.18 --> 4223.90]  But each gospel picks out something particular.
[4224.76 --> 4228.64]  但是每一本福音书都谈到了一个特定的细节。
[4228.64 --> 4231.90]  Each gospel kind of highlight something new for us to explore.
[4232.56 --> 4236.38]  那么每一本福音书都有它独特之处来探究,
[4236.64 --> 4238.02]  让我们去发现。
[4238.02 --> 4240.94]  So what is the detail that Matthew gives us in his account?
[4241.56 --> 4244.20]  那么马太福音中最主要谈的细节是什么呢?
[4244.46 --> 4246.88]  Well Matthew tells us there was an earthquake.
[4247.94 --> 4250.40]  马太说有一个地大震动。
[4250.40 --> 4252.86]  Right, no other gospel writer mentions it.
[4253.46 --> 4256.10]  没有其他的福音作者这样说过。
[4256.10 --> 4257.92]  And actually as we read the gospel of Matthew,
[4258.18 --> 4261.24]  You'll notice that Matthew really likes earthquakes.
[4262.06 --> 4263.06]  He mentions them a lot.
[4263.06 --> 4268.34]  那么你会发现马太福音里面谈到地震了好多次。
[4268.34 --> 4276.82]  Because for Matthew, the resurrection of Jesus is the quaking, the shaking up of all things old.
[4277.70 --> 4283.98]  因为在马太看来,那么耶稣的复活是震动了一切旧造。
[4283.98 --> 4289.28]  When we think about the story of Easter, we need to realize that Easter begins in the old world.
[4289.28 --> 4295.58]  当我们来理解复活节的时候,我们知道复活开始一个旧世界。
[4295.58 --> 4301.38]  Easter begins with the broken dreams, the broken hearts of Jesus' disciples.
[4301.82 --> 4308.46]  那复活节开始于耶稣基督的门徒,破碎的心,破碎的梦。
[4308.46 --> 4315.24]  The story of Easter first confronts us with violence and the abuse of power by corrupt authorities.
[4316.24 --> 4323.32]  那它让我们看到了那个堕落的政府,他们滥用权力,那些武力。
[4323.32 --> 4330.02]  Easter confronts us first with the finality of death, which is the enemy of us all.
[4330.02 --> 4336.76]  那复活节让我们每一个人都不得不面对死亡这个终局。
[4337.02 --> 4339.20]  它是我们所有人的敌人。
[4339.20 --> 4343.94]  And as those two women went to the tomb that Easter morning, what were they expecting to find?
[4344.40 --> 4352.92]  当这两个女人,他们在复活节的早晨来到坟墓的时候,他们渴望看到的是什么呢?
[4353.22 --> 4355.12]  They were expecting to find a dead body.
[4355.70 --> 4358.90]  他们渴望看到的是一个已经死去的人。
[4358.90 --> 4360.96]  But this is what Matthew writes in verse 2.
[4360.96 --> 4364.08]  There was a violent earthquake.
[4365.04 --> 4370.24]  For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb, rolled back the stone.
[4371.08 --> 4371.78]  And I love this.
[4372.38 --> 4373.22]  And sat on it.
[4374.52 --> 4380.90]  那突然地炸震动,因为有主的使者从天上下来把石头滚开,坐在上面。
[4380.90 --> 4382.54]  Why did the angel move the stone?
[4383.60 --> 4386.18]  为什么天使要滚动石头呢?
[4386.62 --> 4389.08]  It's not because Jesus needed it moved to get out.
[4389.82 --> 4394.58]  不是因为耶稣需要他把它挪开,耶稣才能出来。
[4394.58 --> 4396.26]  Jesus had already risen.
[4397.00 --> 4398.10]  耶稣已经复活了。
[4398.10 --> 4404.94]  He had already departed the tomb in a way that is mysterious and miraculous and left unsaid.
[4404.94 --> 4412.26]  那耶稣已经离开坟墓是用我们没有显明的那个奇妙的神奇的方式。
[4412.28 --> 4416.12]  Right, but by the time the angel got there, Jesus was not there.
[4416.60 --> 4420.12]  当天使来到的时候,耶稣已经不在那里了。
[4420.12 --> 4429.60]  The angel's job was simply to roll back the tomb, the stone, and sit on it as a messenger, a herald of Jesus' victory.
[4429.60 --> 4436.40]  所以天使的工作就是把石头滚开,然后坐在上面,成为一个什么?
[4436.70 --> 4439.98]  胜利的使者,胜利的宣言人。
[4439.98 --> 4446.12]  And the earth shook, and it was an earth-shattering moment where God thunderously proclaimed,
[4446.70 --> 4448.82]  I have conquered death.
[4448.82 --> 4451.70]  所以地大震动。
[4451.70 --> 4457.38]  地大震动其实是上帝用雷鸣般的声音在宣告什么?
[4457.76 --> 4460.70]  我已经胜过死亡。
[4460.70 --> 4464.66]  And so the resurrection isn't just the end of the story of the old world.
[4465.22 --> 4471.20]  所以复活是旧故事的结束。
[4471.20 --> 4481.20]  而是上帝新书写的一个新故事的开始。
[4481.20 --> 4486.44]  Right, the resurrection is something that God describes as the first fruits of a new creation.
[4487.48 --> 4490.04]  所以圣经里记载说这是什么?
[4490.58 --> 4493.92]  新生的、新造的、初熟的果子。
[4493.92 --> 4501.34]  Christ's resurrection is the first installment of many more resurrections to come, ours included.
[4502.50 --> 4507.18]  所以耶稣的复活其实是一个预付款,要证明什么?
[4507.40 --> 4509.92]  更多的复活要来到。
[4510.64 --> 4515.66]  And so the resurrection is a historical event in which God is remaking the world in a new creation.
[4515.92 --> 4522.42]  所以复活是一个历史的事件,也是上帝要做什么?
[4522.42 --> 4524.08]  一个新生的开始。
[4524.60 --> 4528.54]  So the next question is, okay, wow, that's beautiful.
[4529.20 --> 4531.14]  How can I be a part of that?
[4531.76 --> 4536.88]  那接下来的一个问题就是,哇,真美啊,但是我怎么参与其中呢?
[4537.50 --> 4540.02]  How can I experience this new creation?
[4540.60 --> 4542.80]  我怎么经历这些新造呢?
[4543.22 --> 4546.18]  And this leads us to our third point we want to look at from our passage,
[4546.70 --> 4549.04]  which is that the resurrection is a gift of grace.
[4549.04 --> 4554.76]  那接下来我们就看第三点,就是复活是恩典的领悟。
[4554.76 --> 4558.52]  Now one of the reasons why I think there were two women at the tomb
[4558.52 --> 4565.10]  was because every single one of Jesus' male disciples had abandoned him when he died on the cross.
[4565.10 --> 4568.38]  那我想为什么这里面出现两个女人?
[4568.66 --> 4571.76]  就是因为当耶稣在十字架上受死的时候,
[4572.08 --> 4574.82]  他所有的男性的门徒都离开他而去了。
[4574.82 --> 4580.10]  Actually, on the night before Jesus died, Jesus told them, in Matthew 26,
[4580.60 --> 4585.92]  Jesus said, this very night you will all fall away on account of me.
[4586.48 --> 4588.74]  实际上在马太福音二十六章三十一节中,
[4589.10 --> 4590.62]  主耶稣曾经告诉过他们,
[4590.82 --> 4593.54]  今夜你们倒要因我跌倒了。
[4593.54 --> 4597.00]  And so right when being a disciple really counted,
[4597.76 --> 4599.34]  right when it mattered,
[4599.86 --> 4601.04]  when Jesus was arrested,
[4601.18 --> 4603.52]  he was on trial before the Roman authorities
[4603.52 --> 4605.54]  and the Jewish religious leaders,
[4605.54 --> 4609.38]  at that moment all of them left him.
[4609.38 --> 4611.30]  所以就门徒而言,
[4611.66 --> 4612.78]  当他被捕的时候,
[4612.96 --> 4616.04]  当他被带到罗马政府面前,
[4616.16 --> 4621.64]  带到犹太人的长官面前去受审的时候,
[4622.08 --> 4623.96]  他们全都离他而去。
[4623.96 --> 4625.42]  And yet,
[4626.42 --> 4629.82]  almost the first words out of Jesus' mouth
[4629.82 --> 4631.18]  when he was raised from the dead
[4631.18 --> 4632.82]  were words of grace.
[4633.82 --> 4636.60]  但是当耶稣复活之后,
[4636.60 --> 4639.86]  他从他口中说的出来的第一句话,
[4640.38 --> 4642.28]  就是一个恩典的语言。
[4642.28 --> 4644.18]  So look what it says in verse 10.
[4645.86 --> 4647.44]  Then Jesus said to them,
[4647.98 --> 4648.98]  Do not be afraid.
[4649.62 --> 4651.92]  Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee.
[4652.40 --> 4653.82]  There they will see me.
[4654.62 --> 4655.52]  耶稣对他们说,
[4655.84 --> 4656.44]  不要害怕,
[4656.76 --> 4658.16]  你们去告诉我的弟兄,
[4658.56 --> 4660.06]  叫他们往加利利去,
[4660.36 --> 4662.06]  在那里必看见我。
[4662.06 --> 4663.64]  So notice what he says there.
[4663.64 --> 4666.90]  看一下耶稣在这里说什么。
[4667.26 --> 4668.26]  He says,
[4668.94 --> 4670.44]  My brothers.
[4670.90 --> 4671.38]  他说,
[4672.00 --> 4673.06]  我的弟兄。
[4673.06 --> 4675.68]  Those guys who have failed me,
[4676.10 --> 4678.90]  who left me at my most vulnerable moment,
[4679.28 --> 4681.64]  who ran away right when I was in trouble,
[4682.90 --> 4685.40]  they're not a bunch of cowards,
[4685.52 --> 4686.22]  that's not what he says,
[4686.92 --> 4687.74]  they're my brothers.
[4687.74 --> 4690.50]  所以这些亏欠了我,
[4690.84 --> 4693.58]  在我最困难的时候离开我而去的,
[4693.84 --> 4698.50]  这些当我在困境当中离我而去逃跑的人,
[4699.46 --> 4701.22]  我没有称他们为胆小鬼,
[4701.60 --> 4704.08]  而是称他们为我的弟兄。
[4704.08 --> 4705.14]  Jesus says,
[4705.84 --> 4707.74]  Tell them I am coming to meet them.
[4708.62 --> 4709.14]  耶稣说,
[4709.38 --> 4710.08]  去告诉他们,
[4710.52 --> 4712.12]  我要去和他们相会。
[4712.12 --> 4714.26]  I can't wait to see them again,
[4714.32 --> 4716.08]  I can't wait to show them I'm alive,
[4716.36 --> 4719.22]  I can't wait to forgive them and to restore them.
[4719.96 --> 4721.84]  我已经等不及要去见他们。
[4722.14 --> 4725.02]  我已经等不及告诉他们我已经复活了。
[4725.02 --> 4727.70]  我已经等不及要去饶恕他们。
[4728.02 --> 4731.28]  我已经等不及要去重建他们。
[4731.58 --> 4733.78]  Friends, this is what grace is.
[4735.12 --> 4736.74]  朋友们,这就是恩典。
[4736.74 --> 4744.20]  那些亏欠了耶稣基督的人,
[4744.60 --> 4746.74]  他愿意称他们为弟兄。
[4746.74 --> 4753.60]  朋友们,这就是做基督徒的意义。
[4753.60 --> 4764.74]  作为一个基督徒就是意识到自己已经亏欠了耶稣基督。
[4764.74 --> 4766.74]  我们都犯了罪。
[4766.74 --> 4769.74]  我们都亏缺了神的荣耀。
[4769.74 --> 4777.00]  We all at some point in our lives will be shaken by the reality that we are not the people we thought we were.
[4777.12 --> 4779.52]  We are not the people we wanted to be.
[4780.46 --> 4782.30]  那么其实在我们人生当中,
[4782.68 --> 4785.10]  我们都有一点突然的会意识到,
[4785.44 --> 4787.78]  原来我们不是我们想的那个人,
[4787.98 --> 4790.74]  也不是我们愿意成为的那个人。
[4790.74 --> 4794.88]  All of us have in some way encountered failure.
[4795.06 --> 4797.08]  We have failed God, ourselves and others.
[4797.74 --> 4801.74]  我们都在某种程度上有过失败。
[4801.74 --> 4806.74]  我们都亏缺了神的荣耀,也亏欠了彼此。
[4806.74 --> 4811.18]  But God literally shook the earth to get our attention,
[4811.64 --> 4813.74]  to say that is not the end of the story.
[4813.74 --> 4818.48]  但是上帝震动天地来引起我们的注意说,
[4818.82 --> 4820.74]  不,这不是故事的结局。
[4820.74 --> 4825.88]  God shook the earth to tell us your sins can be forgiven.
[4826.32 --> 4830.18]  You can be restored and you can be welcomed into the family of God.
[4830.74 --> 4833.32]  上帝震动天地告诉我们说,
[4833.32 --> 4835.88]  你的罪得赦免了。
[4835.88 --> 4838.00]  你可以得到重建。
[4838.00 --> 4841.50]  你欢迎你加入上帝的国度。
[4841.50 --> 4844.14]  And it's not because of something that I've earned.
[4844.56 --> 4845.82]  It's not something that I deserve.
[4846.08 --> 4848.14]  It's not something that God owes me in any way.
[4848.14 --> 4850.70]  It is just a gift of His grace.
[4851.50 --> 4853.32]  这并不是说我值得。
[4853.32 --> 4855.64]  并不是说上帝欠了我什么。
[4855.64 --> 4857.86]  并不是我做得好。
[4857.86 --> 4860.64]  乃是上帝要给我一个礼物。
[4860.64 --> 4862.90]  And this leads us to our fourth point this morning,
[4863.14 --> 4865.20]  That the resurrection demands a response.
[4865.20 --> 4867.14]  这就带到我们的第四点,
[4867.34 --> 4871.20]  就是复活需要一个回应。
[4871.20 --> 4872.76]  And we see in our passage this morning,
[4872.88 --> 4873.70]  That these two women,
[4874.06 --> 4876.18]  They meet the risen Jesus.
[4876.82 --> 4880.98]  Their immediate response was to fall down and worship Him.
[4881.12 --> 4882.80]  在今天的经文当中我们看到,
[4883.12 --> 4886.22]  两个妇女当她们遇到复活的耶稣,
[4886.70 --> 4889.54]  她们第一的反应就是跪下来。
[4889.54 --> 4890.86]  敬拜她。
[4890.86 --> 4891.90]  So have a look at verse 9.
[4893.24 --> 4895.04]  Suddenly, when Jesus met them,
[4895.40 --> 4896.40]  Greetings, He said.
[4896.54 --> 4899.70]  And actually, the original word means rejoice.
[4900.46 --> 4901.56]  He says, Rejoice!
[4902.42 --> 4904.44]  They came to Him,
[4904.92 --> 4906.46]  Clasped His feet,
[4907.20 --> 4907.96]  And worshipped Him.
[4908.52 --> 4909.70]  所以耶稣见到他们,
[4910.06 --> 4912.04]  祂所说的那个话实际上就是说,
[4912.80 --> 4914.54]  欢喜快乐吧。
[4914.54 --> 4915.94]  愿你们平安。
[4916.14 --> 4917.80]  他们就上去抱住他的脚,
[4918.02 --> 4918.54]  拜他。
[4918.54 --> 4921.18]  Right, when we realize what is happening in the resurrection,
[4921.46 --> 4923.14]  That Jesus who died lives again,
[4923.64 --> 4925.30]  The response is to worship.
[4926.00 --> 4927.56]  所以当我们真的意识到,
[4927.74 --> 4929.08]  耶稣死而复活了,
[4929.54 --> 4931.86]  那么我们就要去敬拜。
[4931.86 --> 4934.44]  And the thing that is so remarkable about this,
[4934.86 --> 4937.80]  Is that these women are Jews living in the first century.
[4938.54 --> 4940.60]  那么这件事情意义重大就在于,
[4941.02 --> 4944.14]  这些女人是活在一世纪的,
[4944.36 --> 4945.72]  她们是犹太人。
[4945.72 --> 4946.66]  For a Jewish person,
[4946.66 --> 4951.64]  那么对于犹太人来说,
[4951.70 --> 4954.20]  他们从来没想过要去敬拜一个人。
[4954.20 --> 4955.66]  那么对于犹太人来说,
[4955.66 --> 4957.08]  他们从来没想过要去敬拜一个人。
[4957.08 --> 4962.20]  那犹太人他们所坚持的就是敬拜独一真身。
[4962.20 --> 4964.10]  Right, and so all over the Bible,
[4964.24 --> 4966.26]  When an angel comes and visits someone,
[4966.42 --> 4968.68]  And they're kind of like struck down with fear,
[4969.14 --> 4970.24]  They fall down,
[4970.34 --> 4971.94]  And they start worshiping the angel.
[4972.90 --> 4973.94]  所以在圣经里面,
[4974.04 --> 4975.20]  到处都有这样的记载,
[4975.20 --> 4977.64]  当一个天使来造访人的时候,
[4977.94 --> 4979.32]  那人出于害怕,
[4979.60 --> 4981.32]  他们就会跪下来,
[4981.52 --> 4984.20]  然后敬拜天使。
[4984.20 --> 4985.32]  And what does the angel say?
[4986.56 --> 4987.84]  No, get up!
[4988.58 --> 4989.90]  I'm, don't worship me,
[4990.10 --> 4990.92]  I'm just a servant!
[4990.92 --> 4992.68]  You worship God alone!
[4993.18 --> 4994.78]  所以天使就会说,
[4995.34 --> 4996.58]  不不不,赶紧起来,
[4996.98 --> 4998.30]  不要敬拜我,
[4998.38 --> 5000.08]  因为我只是一个仆人,
[5000.42 --> 5003.28]  你们要单单地敬拜神。
[5003.28 --> 5004.82]  You know, in the book of Acts,
[5004.90 --> 5006.30]  As the apostles are going around,
[5006.40 --> 5007.66]  And maybe they heal someone,
[5008.20 --> 5011.02]  And the people will worship the apostle.
[5012.02 --> 5013.50]  那在使徒经传中我们看到,
[5013.66 --> 5015.10]  使徒医治了人的时候,
[5015.44 --> 5017.92]  人们就会来向他们下拜。
[5018.82 --> 5019.90]  And the apostles are like,
[5019.90 --> 5020.98]  No, get up!
[5021.24 --> 5022.14]  Don't worship us,
[5022.22 --> 5023.06]  We are just servants.
[5023.54 --> 5024.44]  Worship God alone,
[5024.56 --> 5026.74]  He is the one that healed this person.
[5027.24 --> 5028.36]  那使徒也会说,
[5028.62 --> 5029.28]  不要不要,
[5029.38 --> 5030.04]  赶紧起来,
[5030.14 --> 5031.68]  不要敬拜我们,
[5031.74 --> 5033.66]  因为我们只是仆人。
[5033.66 --> 5035.72]  那你们要敬拜独一的真神,
[5035.88 --> 5037.94]  祂才是真正医治你们的。
[5037.94 --> 5038.96]  So amazingly,
[5039.40 --> 5039.56]  Right?
[5039.66 --> 5040.18]  These women,
[5040.40 --> 5041.56]  They get to the empty tomb.
[5041.96 --> 5042.54]  It's empty.
[5042.74 --> 5043.50]  There's no dead body.
[5043.50 --> 5045.38]  They see the risen Jesus,
[5045.88 --> 5047.60]  And they fall down,
[5047.72 --> 5049.16]  And they worship him.
[5049.16 --> 5051.04]  所以令人吃惊的就是,
[5051.28 --> 5052.86]  这些女人,
[5052.98 --> 5053.92]  她们来到坟墓,
[5054.12 --> 5055.48]  看到的是一个空坟墓,
[5055.82 --> 5058.16]  然后她们遇到了复活的耶稣,
[5058.38 --> 5059.86]  她们就跪下来,
[5060.22 --> 5061.16]  敬拜他。
[5061.16 --> 5062.20]  And what does Jesus do?
[5062.20 --> 5064.50]  耶稣做了什么呢?
[5064.90 --> 5066.22]  He accepts their worship.
[5066.76 --> 5068.54]  耶稣接受了他们的敬拜。
[5068.54 --> 5069.66]  It's as if he is saying,
[5069.80 --> 5071.30]  I am the God who made you.
[5071.52 --> 5073.02]  I am the risen Lord.
[5073.56 --> 5075.92]  It is right and good for you to worship me.
[5076.34 --> 5077.48]  这就像耶稣在说,
[5078.08 --> 5080.38]  我就是造你们的那一位。
[5080.38 --> 5081.66]  你们来敬拜我,
[5081.66 --> 5082.70]  是合一的,
[5083.00 --> 5084.42]  是对的。
[5084.42 --> 5086.00]  And I love what it says,
[5086.24 --> 5089.38]   where it says the women were afraid,
[5089.64 --> 5090.88]   and yet filled with joy.
[5090.88 --> 5092.70]  那我很喜欢的说,
[5092.80 --> 5094.56]  这些女人她们很害怕,
[5094.78 --> 5096.88]  但是她们心里充满了喜乐。
[5097.78 --> 5100.54]  When we realize what is happening in the resurrection,
[5101.02 --> 5102.58]  That Jesus who died lives again,
[5103.22 --> 5105.22]  The only response that makes sense
[5105.22 --> 5108.70]  Is to be filled with awe and with joy.
[5109.38 --> 5113.44]  所以当我们真的意识到耶稣死而复活了,
[5113.88 --> 5115.90]  那么最正确的反应,
[5115.90 --> 5117.84]  最合理的反应,
[5118.26 --> 5120.86]  就是我们来敬拜他。
[5120.88 --> 5123.98]  Friends, the resurrection is not the end of the story,
[5124.54 --> 5127.00]  It is the beginning of a new story.
[5127.80 --> 5128.70]  朋友们,
[5129.08 --> 5131.62]  复活不是一个故事的结束,
[5132.08 --> 5134.62]  乃是一个新故事的开始。
[5134.62 --> 5138.26]  And so the question that is posed to each of us is,
[5138.36 --> 5139.54]  Will we have the heart?
[5140.10 --> 5141.48]  Will we have the imagination?
[5142.00 --> 5144.78]  Will we have the humility to believe it?
[5145.44 --> 5148.04]  那我抛给大家的问题就是说,
[5148.44 --> 5149.68]  我们是不是有心,
[5150.08 --> 5151.20]  有这样的敬畏,
[5151.44 --> 5152.42]  有这样的谦卑,
[5152.66 --> 5153.92]  有这样的想象力,
[5154.40 --> 5156.62]  来相信并且接受它。
[5156.62 --> 5158.98]  Will we worship Jesus?
[5159.72 --> 5162.60]  And will our lives be transformed by joy?
[5162.60 --> 5165.94]  我们会敬拜耶稣吗?
[5166.30 --> 5171.08]  我们的生命会因此而充满喜乐而被改变吗?
[5172.08 --> 5172.98]  Let us pray.
[5173.44 --> 5174.36]  让我们来祷告。
[5174.36 --> 5176.08]  Heavenly Father,
[5176.18 --> 5179.26]  We confess that we never dreamed of such a story,
[5180.04 --> 5182.88]  As is displayed for us in your gospel.
[5184.14 --> 5184.96]  天父上帝,
[5185.36 --> 5186.04]  我们承认,
[5186.54 --> 5188.80]  我们从来没有想过,
[5188.98 --> 5190.28]  做梦都没有想过,
[5190.28 --> 5194.40]  像你在这个圣经里所给我们展示的这个故事。
[5194.40 --> 5196.02]  You have come into our world,
[5196.12 --> 5197.72]  You have conquered sin and death,
[5197.88 --> 5199.56]  And you rose from the grave.
[5200.16 --> 5201.82]  你来到我们这个世界,
[5202.44 --> 5203.78]  你胜过了罪,
[5203.78 --> 5205.28]  胜过了死亡,
[5205.94 --> 5208.56]  你从死里复活。
[5208.56 --> 5211.98]  And Lord, if there is anyone here today who does not know you,
[5213.42 --> 5214.82]  主啊,今天在这里的,
[5215.16 --> 5216.98]  还有不认识你的。
[5216.98 --> 5219.68]  I pray that you would cause them to be born again,
[5219.90 --> 5221.92]  To a living hope in the resurrection of Jesus.
[5223.32 --> 5224.28]  我为他们祷告,
[5224.90 --> 5226.68]  求你让他们有心生,
[5227.32 --> 5228.86]  有永活的盼望,
[5229.58 --> 5231.78]  因为耶稣已经复活了。
[5231.78 --> 5234.14]  And Lord, I pray that for all of us,
[5234.22 --> 5236.98]  That the same power that raised Jesus from the dead,
[5236.98 --> 5239.36]  Would form faith in our hearts,
[5239.48 --> 5240.76]  That we might worship you,
[5241.46 --> 5242.98]  And be made new by you.
[5242.98 --> 5247.36]  主啊,我也为我们每一个人祈求,
[5248.04 --> 5249.00]  愿你的圣灵,
[5249.66 --> 5252.58]  是耶稣基督死而复活的那个大能,
[5253.40 --> 5254.52]  在我们心里,
[5254.82 --> 5256.74]  使我们的信仰得以确立,
[5257.22 --> 5259.02]  使我们能够敬拜你,
[5259.44 --> 5261.76]  使我们能够被你更新。
[5261.76 --> 5264.64]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[5265.08 --> 5265.40]  Amen.
[5265.70 --> 5265.94]  Amen.
[5268.16 --> 5269.44]  Okay, let's all stand,
[5269.68 --> 5271.08]  And we'll sing our song of response.
[5271.08 --> 5272.54]  血止 aqui,
[5272.78 --> 5276.88]  放燥 sacrifice,
[5276.88 --> 5303.96]  Come people of the risen King, who delight and bring Him praise.
[5303.96 --> 5311.96]  Come all and tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[5312.66 --> 5320.92]  From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to Him.
[5321.46 --> 5329.34]  Their steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[5329.34 --> 5337.34]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[5338.24 --> 5345.34]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[5345.34 --> 5360.34]  Come those who joy is morning sun and those weeping through the night.
[5360.34 --> 5369.24]  Come those who tell the battle's won and those struggling in the fight.
[5369.64 --> 5377.62]  For His perfect will will never change and His mercies never cease.
[5377.62 --> 5385.90]  But unfollow us through all of His with a certain hope of peace.
[5386.90 --> 5393.62]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[5394.70 --> 5401.62]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[5401.62 --> 5417.02]  Come young and old from every land, men and women of the faith.
[5417.02 --> 5425.48]  Come those with full or empty hands, but their riches in His grace.
[5425.48 --> 5429.76]  O the fallen world, His people sing.
[5430.08 --> 5433.58]  Come and show that we hear them call.
[5434.10 --> 5441.78]  The truth that cries to every age, our God is all in all.
[5441.78 --> 5450.12]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[5450.12 --> 5457.62]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[5458.62 --> 5466.48]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[5466.48 --> 5474.48]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[5489.48 --> 5490.58]  Yep, you may be seated.
[5490.58 --> 5496.04]  And so friends, just as Jesus' resurrection is the first fruits of a new creation,
[5496.48 --> 5501.04]  so we are called to give the first fruits of all that God gives to us
[5501.04 --> 5503.00]  and lay them at the feet of Jesus.
[5503.38 --> 5507.34]  And so our offering today is for Resonate Global Mission,
[5507.48 --> 5510.42]  which is in our denomination our global mission body.
[5510.94 --> 5513.48]  And in particular, we support the Umrans,
[5514.06 --> 5516.30]  who are missionaries in the Middle East.
[5516.66 --> 5520.72]  And so may I ask the deacons to come forward and collect our morning offering.
