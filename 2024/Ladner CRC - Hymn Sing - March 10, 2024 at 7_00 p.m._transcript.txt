[194.60 --> 197.56]  They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty.
[197.56 --> 200.48]  And I will meditate on your wondrous works.
[201.12 --> 204.18]  They will tell the power of your awesome deeds.
[204.74 --> 206.98]  And I will proclaim your great deeds.
[207.58 --> 212.20]  They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[213.06 --> 214.10]  Let's pray together.
[214.10 --> 223.58]  Heavenly Father, Triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[224.00 --> 226.08]  Father, we thank you for gathering us this evening.

[233.54 --> 235.10]  that we can come together in this evening.
[235.78 --> 239.92]  And that we can once again on this Lord's Day worship you.
[239.92 --> 243.10]  Lord, you are worthy of all of our praise.
[243.28 --> 247.84]  Lord, your wondrous deeds resound to your glory.
[248.86 --> 254.94]  And so, Lord, we, your people, we sing for joy and we sing in praise to you.
[255.36 --> 261.52]  Lord, would you help us to enjoy you this evening and to enjoy our time together.
[262.18 --> 265.42]  Lord, we lift up our voices, our hearts, and our prayers to you.

[267.84 --> 267.94]  Amen.
[269.92 --> 270.92]  Amen.
[279.56 --> 282.76]  Just before we start, there's just a couple of announcements.
[283.92 --> 287.82]  Some of the hymns that we're singing tonight are actually in the gray hymnal in your pews.
[287.96 --> 291.32]  And I know that some of you really enjoy having music in front of you, so you can sing all
[291.32 --> 292.26]  those wonderful parts.
[293.06 --> 297.98]  So, the ones that are in the hymnal, it will be listed on the title slide.
[297.98 --> 301.18]  The other ones will all be projected.
[302.22 --> 305.18]  So, do what you will with those ones.
[305.90 --> 308.28]  And, what's something else?
[308.34 --> 311.28]  Oh, I just wanted to thank Mel for being on the organ tonight.
[311.28 --> 313.98]  And, John, for being on the trumpet.
[313.98 --> 317.26]  And, we don't have a big worship team because you are the worship team.
[317.36 --> 319.24]  You are the ones who are going to praise and worship God.
[319.24 --> 325.20]  And, so, we are going to keep our leading to a minimum.
[325.36 --> 326.32]  We'll bring you in and stuff.
[326.48 --> 329.32]  But, we are expecting much from you.
[331.38 --> 331.74]  Okay.
[331.90 --> 336.62]  And, once in a while, we will ask you to just rise and just, you know, be able to stand up
[336.62 --> 338.42]  for a minute or two for a song here and there.
[338.42 --> 339.46]  Okay.
[339.74 --> 342.36]  So, why don't you rise for our first song?
[342.98 --> 344.68]  Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing.
[344.72 --> 348.50]  And, there's not a thousand of us here, but you're going to sound like a thousand.
[348.68 --> 350.26]  It's like the bread and the five fishes.
[350.40 --> 350.68]  Okay.
[350.88 --> 351.98]  It's going to just multiply.
[351.98 --> 352.20]  It's going to just be a little wine.
[352.20 --> 352.22]  It's going to just be a little wine.
[381.98 --> 386.78]  Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing.

[413.10 --> 423.10]  Just with you all, we let the blood in the honors of your name.
[423.10 --> 434.50]  The name of Jesus, God's praise, He's such a word of peace.
[435.02 --> 444.66]  He is missing in the sinner's ears, He is light and health and peace.
[444.66 --> 451.10]  He breaks the power of counseled sin.
[451.46 --> 455.68]  He sets the prisoner free.
[456.58 --> 461.30]  His blood can make the foulest clean.
[461.30 --> 466.20]  His blood availed for me.
[474.66 --> 489.68]  To God all glory, praise and love, be now and ever again.

[906.78 --> 911.78]  God's invitation.
[911.78 --> 915.78]  And scripture is from John 7 37 to 39a.
[915.78 --> 923.10]  On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice,
[923.64 --> 926.84]  If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
[927.54 --> 933.90]  Whoever believes in me, as the scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.
[934.56 --> 940.38]  By this he met the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive.
[942.46 --> 945.42]  Our song will begin with living waters.
[945.78 --> 946.98]  Followed by the river.

[1426.60 --> 1429.94]  The Lord, the Lord is my strength and my song.
[1429.94 --> 1431.62]  He is my salvation.
[1432.44 --> 1435.60]  With joy, you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
[1436.52 --> 1438.14]  In that day, you will say,
[1438.64 --> 1439.86]  give thanks to the Lord,
[1440.14 --> 1441.20]  call on his name,
[1441.68 --> 1444.22]  make known among the nations what he has done,
[1444.52 --> 1447.04]  and proclaim that his name is exalted.
[1447.04 --> 1449.04]  Sing to the Lord,
[1449.04 --> 1451.14]  for he has done glorious things.
[1451.14 --> 1453.94]  Let this be known to all the world.
[1453.94 --> 1457.40]  Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion,
[1457.94 --> 1461.14]  for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.
[1463.04 --> 1464.46]  We will be singing,
[1464.62 --> 1466.18]  Jesus, keep me near the cross,
[1466.36 --> 1467.18]  followed by,
[1467.40 --> 1468.64]  I stand amazed.
[1477.22 --> 1478.44]  your lady and the Lord.
[1478.62 --> 1479.74]  You see him,
[1479.74 --> 1480.06]  will you?
[1480.06 --> 1480.80]  Ask him,
[1480.80 --> 1481.88]  say hello,
[1481.88 --> 1482.48] racio of Solomon 1,
[1483.18 --> 1484.48]  who he has done glorious things.
[1485.50 --> 1486.70]  banning money to cash,
[1500.10 --> 1501.12]  raise your heart into cash,
[1501.26 --> 1502.64]  pushing down a cross.
[1502.64 --> 1503.64]  Amen.
[1532.64 --> 1534.64]  Amen.

[1760.64 --> 1762.64]  Amen.
[1762.64 --> 1764.64]  I stand and praise
[1764.64 --> 1766.64]  in the presence
[1766.64 --> 1768.64]  of Jesus
[1768.64 --> 1770.64]  the mastery

[1874.64 --> 1876.64]  how wonderful
[1877.20 --> 1880.88]  Lord Savior, come for me.
[1884.18 --> 1888.88]  God's Son, God's millimeters sont blind
[1888.88 --> 1892.30]  In my healinguch my heart go away
[1893.12 --> 1899.04]  It was betterout here, I received my Son
[1899.04 --> 1903.06]  And now I am heavenly only
[1903.06 --> 1918.32]  It was good that when I received my son, and now I am happy all the way.
[1921.82 --> 1923.00]  You may be seated.
[1923.00 --> 1934.14]  And you will get a moment's break here because John and Mel are going to do a special number of the Holy City.
[1953.00 --> 1982.98]  You may be seated.
[1983.00 --> 2012.98]  You may be seated.
[2013.00 --> 2042.98]  You may be seated.
[2042.98 --> 2072.96]  You may be seated.
[2072.96 --> 2102.94]  You may be seated.
[2102.94 --> 2104.94]  You may be seated.
[2104.94 --> 2106.94]  Amen.
[2134.94 --> 2136.94]  Amen.
[2164.94 --> 2166.94]  Amen.
[2194.94 --> 2206.98]  That was very beautiful.
[2212.34 --> 2215.08]  We will continue with the theme.
[2215.82 --> 2223.08]  It's entitled God's Presence, and I will be reading from Psalm 139, verses 7 to 12.
[2223.08 --> 2228.76]  Where can I go from your spirit?
[2229.52 --> 2231.36]  Where can I flee from your presence?
[2232.00 --> 2234.36]  If I go up to the heavens, you are there.
[2234.74 --> 2237.62]  If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
[2238.14 --> 2243.26]  If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,
[2243.86 --> 2248.38]  even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.
[2248.38 --> 2255.04]  If I say, surely the darkness will hide me, and the light becomes night around me,
[2255.38 --> 2257.96]  even the darkness will not be dark to you.
[2258.52 --> 2263.42]  The night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
[2263.42 --> 2273.68]  We will be singing, When We Walk With The Lord, followed by Wonderful Words of Life.
[2273.68 --> 2294.54]  We Walk With The Lord, in the time of his day,
[2294.54 --> 2296.54]  We will be singing, When We Walk With The Lord, followed by Wonderful Words of Life.
[2296.54 --> 2301.54]  We will be singing, When We Walk With The Lord, followed by Wonderful Words of Life.
[2301.54 --> 2306.54]  He will be singing, When We Walk With The Lord, followed by Wonderful Words of Life.
[2306.54 --> 2312.30]  And with all who will trust and obey.
[2314.04 --> 2320.40]  Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[2320.40 --> 2328.14]  To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[2328.14 --> 2338.10]  And we never knew that in life's love is far
[2338.10 --> 2343.92]  But to long out the old man we lay.
[2345.50 --> 2352.30]  For the faith that he chose, and the joy he needs to be
[2352.30 --> 2357.20]  Far from those who will trust and obey.
[2358.82 --> 2365.16]  Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[2365.16 --> 2372.80]  To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[2372.80 --> 2378.82]  And in the mountains we will see
[2378.82 --> 2382.80]  We will stand at his feet
[2382.80 --> 2389.12]  For we'll walk by his side in the rain
[2389.12 --> 2393.58]  Now his hands he will do
[2393.58 --> 2396.80]  Where his hands he will go
[2396.80 --> 2402.36]  And we only trust and obey
[2402.36 --> 2409.80]  Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[2410.36 --> 2418.60]  To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[2418.60 --> 2428.60]  One of the ways that God is present with us
[2428.60 --> 2429.54]  Is in his words.
[2429.78 --> 2432.24]  And this is an old, old hymn
[2432.24 --> 2434.66]  That you probably haven't sung for a long, long time.
[2434.74 --> 2435.86]  Wonderful Words of Life.
[2436.26 --> 2438.00]  It's kind of one of my favorites when I was a kid.
[2438.00 --> 2462.00]  Sing the Lord again to me
[2462.00 --> 2466.00]  Wonderful Words of Life.
[2466.00 --> 2471.00]  Let me call their beauty, see
[2471.00 --> 2475.00]  Wonderful Words of Life.
[2475.00 --> 2480.00]  Words of life and beauty
[2480.00 --> 2484.00]  Teach me faith and beauty
[2484.00 --> 2489.00]  Beautiful Words of Life
[2489.00 --> 2494.00]  Wonderful Words of Life
[2494.00 --> 2496.00]  Beautiful Words of Life
[2496.00 --> 2502.00]  Wonderful Words of Life
[2502.00 --> 2504.00]  Wonderful Words of Life
[2504.00 --> 2508.00]  For I sing this in the midst of our
[2508.00 --> 2512.00]  Come in the words of life
[2512.00 --> 2516.00]  Sing this in the loving love
[2516.00 --> 2521.00]  Young, young, young, wonderful words of life
[2521.00 --> 2525.00]  Long so freely given
[2525.00 --> 2530.00]  Moving us to heaven
[2530.00 --> 2534.00]  Good, Lord, wonderful words
[2534.00 --> 2537.00]  Young, beautiful words of life
[2537.00 --> 2539.00]  Good, Lord, wonderful words
[2539.00 --> 2541.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2541.00 --> 2542.00]  Wonderful words
[2542.00 --> 2544.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2544.00 --> 2546.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2546.00 --> 2548.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2548.00 --> 2550.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2550.00 --> 2553.00]  Hear all the piazcum now
[2553.00 --> 2554.00]  Come in the words of life
[2554.00 --> 2558.00]  Come in the words of life
[2558.00 --> 2562.00]  After God and peace to come
[2562.00 --> 2564.00]  Come in the words of life
[2564.00 --> 2566.00]  Jesus, the Holy Savior
[2566.00 --> 2571.00]  Jesus, the Holy Savior
[2571.00 --> 2576.00]  Stained in power forever
[2576.00 --> 2578.00]  Beautiful words
[2578.00 --> 2579.00]  Wonderful words
[2579.00 --> 2580.00]  Wonderful words
[2580.00 --> 2584.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2584.00 --> 2586.00]  Beautiful words
[2586.00 --> 2587.00]  Wonderful words
[2587.00 --> 2588.00]  Wonderful words
[2588.00 --> 2593.00]  Wonderful words of life
[2593.00 --> 2594.00]  Amen.
[2605.00 --> 2606.52]  We respond.
[2607.74 --> 2612.46]  And the scripture is from Psalm 71, 14 to 18.
[2613.52 --> 2616.70]  But as for me, I will always have hope.
[2617.04 --> 2618.78]  I will praise you more and more.
[2618.78 --> 2625.76]  My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure.
[2626.32 --> 2632.84]  I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O sovereign Lord, and proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.
[2633.52 --> 2639.50]  Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
[2640.20 --> 2643.92]  Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God,
[2643.92 --> 2650.32]  till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.
[2653.22 --> 2662.30]  And our songs will be, My Jesus, I Love Thee, followed by, My Life Flows On in Endless Song.
[2662.30 --> 2666.08]  My Jesus, I Love Thee,
[2666.08 --> 2684.26]  My Jesus, I Love Thee,
[2684.26 --> 2696.72]  My Jesus, I Love Thee, my Lord, O God, O God,
[2696.72 --> 2705.40]  For Thee, all the glory, does we have retired?
[2705.40 --> 2715.40]  Our gracious Redeemer, our Savior, O God.
[2716.90 --> 2726.40]  In heaven, our glory, our Jesus is mine.
[2726.40 --> 2736.40]  I love thee, he loves the past words of me,
[2737.26 --> 2746.76]  And purchase my fire on Galilee's stream.
[2746.76 --> 2756.90]  I love thee, your weary, the past of thy crown.
[2757.16 --> 2766.76]  In heaven, I love thee, my Jesus is mine.
[2766.76 --> 2775.90]  I love thee, your glory, my love thee,
[2775.90 --> 2786.32]  And praise thee, your soul, with the rest of me.
[2786.32 --> 2796.46]  I love thee, your Savior, my love thee,
[2796.46 --> 2797.62]  I love thee, my Son, with the rest of me.
[2797.62 --> 2807.80]  In heaven, I love thee, my Jesus is mine.
[2807.80 --> 2819.94]  In mansions of glory and endless divine,
[2819.94 --> 2830.36]  Forever, Lord, in heaven so high,
[2830.36 --> 2840.70]  O Savior, my victory, thou art my crown.
[2840.70 --> 2851.50]  In heaven, I love thee, my Jesus is mine.
[2854.88 --> 2857.36]  I'm going to ask you to stand for the next song.
[2857.36 --> 2862.96]  My life flows on in endless song.
[2863.16 --> 2864.54]  And you may not be too familiar,
[2864.70 --> 2866.14]  But it's pretty easy to catch on to.
[2866.80 --> 2868.48]  And just a little tip here,
[2868.62 --> 2871.44]  If you've never heard Eva Cassidy sing this song,
[2872.36 --> 2873.08]  Look her up.
[2873.84 --> 2875.34]  She does such a lovely rendition.
[2875.34 --> 2882.82]  Psalm 396, role in Lord Vaynecomandel PTX.
[2882.82 --> 2903.82]  The night falls on in endless snow,
[2903.82 --> 2908.82]  The breathless man always is low,
[2908.82 --> 2913.82]  The breathless spring goes on,
[2913.82 --> 2917.82]  And gives a new creation,
[2917.82 --> 2922.82]  The breathless man always is low,
[2922.82 --> 2927.82]  And will have gone and clean,
[2927.82 --> 2932.82]  Since Christ is born of heaven and earth,
[2932.82 --> 2940.82]  How will I keep from singing?
[2940.82 --> 2944.82]  All the dawn of dawn's light,
[2944.82 --> 2949.82]  I hear the music ringing,
[2949.82 --> 2953.82]  In light the candle of my soul,
[2953.82 --> 2958.82]  How can I keep from singing?
[2958.82 --> 2963.82]  The hope's gone, the shape I am most of,
[2963.82 --> 2968.82]  The earth I've gone and clean in,
[2968.82 --> 2973.82]  Since Christ is born of heaven and earth,
[2973.82 --> 2980.82]  How can I keep from singing?
[2980.82 --> 2985.82]  How will my joy and comfort start,
[2985.82 --> 2989.82]  So you're my Savior given?
[2989.82 --> 2994.82]  The world's the darkness gather round,
[2994.82 --> 2998.82]  So sing the night begin,
[2998.82 --> 3003.82]  The storm and shake my angels long,
[3003.82 --> 3008.82]  How will the dawn and day be?
[3008.82 --> 3013.82]  Since Christ is born of heaven and earth,
[3013.82 --> 3018.82]  How can I keep from singing?
[3018.82 --> 3025.82]  The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,
[3025.82 --> 3030.82]  The fountain ever springing,
[3030.82 --> 3032.82]  All things are light,
[3032.82 --> 3034.82]  His hand is,
[3034.82 --> 3039.82]  The plan I keep from singing,
[3039.82 --> 3041.82]  The love's the light and day be?
[3041.82 --> 3047.82]  How can I keep from singing?
[3047.82 --> 3049.82]  The love's the light and day be,
[3049.82 --> 3053.82]  If Christ is born of heaven and earth,
[3053.82 --> 3058.82]  How can I keep from singing?
[3058.82 --> 3083.50]  our last theme is God's faithful presence tomorrow and I'll read Romans 8 31 to 38
[3083.50 --> 3099.34]  what then shall we say in response to this if God is for us who can be against us he who did not spare
[3099.34 --> 3107.32]  his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all
[3107.32 --> 3115.38]  things who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen it is God who justifies who
[3115.38 --> 3122.70]  is he that condemns Christ Jesus who died more than that who was raised to life is at the right
[3122.70 --> 3131.44]  hand of God and is also interceding for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall trouble or
[3131.44 --> 3140.62]  hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword as it is written for your sake we
[3140.62 --> 3148.48]  face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered no in all things we are more than
[3148.48 --> 3155.86]  conquerors through him who loved us for I am convinced that neither death nor life neither
[3155.86 --> 3164.10]  angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor
[3164.10 --> 3171.22]  anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ
