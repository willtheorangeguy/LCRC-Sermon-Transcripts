[1722.68 → 1752.66] Thank you.
[1752.68 → 1782.66] Thank you.
[1782.68 → 1812.66] Thank you.
[1812.68 → 1842.66] Thank you.
[1842.68 → 1872.66] Thank you.
[1872.68 → 1902.66] Thank you.
[1902.66 → 1932.64] So, good morning.
[1932.64 → 1962.62] And we're going to see you.
[1962.62 → 1992.62] And we're going to be in the next,
[1992.62 → 2022.60] this is John, this is John.
[2022.60 → 2052.60] I'm going to say,
[2052.60 → 2082.58] and you're going to say,
[2082.58 → 2112.58] and we're not far,
[2112.58 → 2142.56] and we're going to say,
[2142.58 → 2172.56] which we're going to say,
[2172.56 → 2202.56] and we're going to go to the next,
[2202.56 → 2232.56] and we're going to go to the next,
[2232.56 → 2262.54] and we're going to say,
[2262.54 → 2292.54] and we're going to do the next, and we're going to say, and we're going to go to the next, we're going to do it, and we're going to do, but we're going to do with the next,
[2292.54 → 2296.66] the story of course of Luke. He knew what Luke wrote, and I think there is a reference here. So
[2296.66 → 2304.28] Luke in chapter 5 records an almost identical story. It's at the beginning of Jesus's ministry
[2304.28 → 2311.38] when he calls his disciples to follow him. They are on the shore of Galilee just as they are here.
[2312.22 → 2319.54] It's the same people involved especially Peter and John. It's probably the same boat. This is
[2319.54 → 2326.34] likely Peter's fishing boat and in both instances the same thing happens right. At first the disciples
[2326.34 → 2332.26] they have fished all night, and they haven't caught anything but then Jesus says to them try again
[2332.26 → 2339.46] cast in your nets and there is an enormous miraculous catch of fish. The same thing happens here
[2339.46 → 2346.48] and in Luke chapter 5. The parallels are striking and one is at the beginning of Jesus's three years
[2346.48 → 2354.18] with them. The other here in John 21 is at the end of his three years with them, and it's this context of
[2354.18 → 2360.98] this déjà vu experience of this happening again of pulling this net full of fish into the boat
[2360.98 → 2368.96] that Jesus recognizes or sorry or reveals himself. They recognize him and Jesus reveals himself to them
[2368.96 → 2376.80] as the risen Lord. And the way that Jesus reveals himself is he waits until they have exhausted all of their own
[2376.80 → 2382.58] strength. They've tried to do it in their own effort to show us that we are not self-sufficient
[2382.58 → 2391.66] but actually that we are dependent on him. And this is something you know that Jesus teaches over and over in
[2391.66 → 2398.20] the Gospel of John. And it's summarized in John chapter 15 verse 5. You know when Jesus looks
[2398.20 → 2405.32] his disciples in the eye, and he says to them, I am the vine you are the branches if you remain in me
[2405.32 → 2413.42] and I in you, you will bear much fruit. Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[2413.42 → 2420.20] You know and this is basic very basic to what it means to be a Christian.
[2421.40 → 2429.16] Right? Christianity is not basically what we do. Christianity is what Jesus keeps doing for us.
[2429.16 → 2439.36] Right? Over and over again by his grace as we moment by moment continually receive from him and depend on him.
[2439.36 → 2446.02] And that is what Jesus is teaching his disciples and us today in this passage.
[2447.16 → 2453.54] So let's see how Jesus does this. How does he teach us that we need to not be self-reliant but be dependent on him.
[2454.34 → 2458.50] And what we're going to do today I don't have a point. I was going to say I don't have a point. I do have a point.
[2458.80 → 2464.02] I don't have like three points. We're just going to walk through the passage, and then we'll consider some application at the end.
[2464.02 → 2469.60] So let's just look through this passage, and we'll begin in verse 1 looking at verses 1 to 3.
[2470.48 → 2472.62] So here it is again up here on the screen.
[2474.18 → 2479.16] Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Galilee.
[2479.70 → 2487.48] It happened this way. We got Simon Peter, Thomas also called Didymous, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, two other disciples.
[2487.88 → 2489.36] How many together? Did you count?
[2490.90 → 2493.06] Seven? Seven? Eight? Okay I don't know.
[2493.06 → 2494.50] Okay I'll take your word for it. Eight.
[2497.02 → 2499.94] I am going out to fish, Simon Peter told them.
[2500.38 → 2502.72] And they said we'll go with you.
[2503.70 → 2504.78] It's a fishing trip.
[2506.14 → 2514.46] Now some commentators, some people have said that the disciples should not have been fishing.
[2514.46 → 2521.34] Right? That they sort of in this instance are backsliding by returning to their old way of life as fishermen.
[2521.78 → 2525.68] When they should have been going forward in the preaching of the gospel.
[2526.48 → 2528.88] And so some commentators give them a hard time here.
[2530.10 → 2532.34] Others will say, kind of on the other side of the spectrum,
[2532.34 → 2535.94] Hang on. The disciples still have to eat, don't they?
[2536.40 → 2537.62] How will they eat?
[2538.10 → 2539.08] They need to fish.
[2539.42 → 2540.70] Right? Fishing was their livelihood.
[2540.70 → 2544.84] I think the truth is kind of in the middle.
[2546.16 → 2550.00] Probably, you know, well of course yes, they do need to eat.
[2550.58 → 2556.46] But there's also a sense in which the disciples are still in a sort of spiritual darkness
[2556.46 → 2563.66] concerning their mission in life, concerning, you know, the way that they are going to be servants of Jesus.
[2563.66 → 2569.32] Back in Luke 5, right, our parallel story, Jesus had said to them,
[2569.78 → 2573.80] From now on you will be fishers of men.
[2574.82 → 2576.80] That is not what they're doing here.
[2576.90 → 2578.56] They're being fishers of fish.
[2580.04 → 2583.84] So I think that's something that John is trying to draw our attention to.
[2584.24 → 2589.26] But he's also making the point that whether the disciples ought to have been fishing,
[2590.24 → 2591.96] they are fishing how?
[2591.96 → 2594.58] They're fishing in their own strength.
[2595.36 → 2597.52] Peter says, I am going fishing.
[2597.78 → 2599.52] They say, we will go with you.
[2600.40 → 2603.70] And then verse 3 continues, and it says, it says this,
[2603.98 → 2609.18] So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
[2610.88 → 2615.22] Now notice up here, verses 1 through 3, there is no reference to Jesus.
[2615.96 → 2616.94] Jesus is not there.
[2617.26 → 2618.40] There is no mention of him.
[2618.40 → 2624.22] And these professional fishermen, in the absence of Jesus, they caught nothing.
[2625.18 → 2627.12] Now I am not a professional fisherman.
[2627.72 → 2629.46] I am not even an amateur fisherman.
[2629.92 → 2631.74] Because I usually don't catch anything.
[2632.42 → 2635.34] I think you have, can you call yourself a fisherman if you don't catch fish?
[2635.96 → 2637.46] Any, I mean, I don't know.
[2637.46 → 2639.42] But I do like to be outside.
[2639.72 → 2640.92] I do like to be out on the water.
[2641.22 → 2650.56] So when my family and I moved to BC, our previous church, one of our elders, he had his own hunting and fishing business, charter business.
[2650.56 → 2654.78] And so he took us out on his boat one time, beautiful boat.
[2655.48 → 2656.78] And he showed us how to do it.
[2656.82 → 2658.42] He brought us right to the right spot.
[2658.54 → 2659.60] He said, here's the bait.
[2659.74 → 2661.00] Hold the line like this.
[2661.64 → 2665.14] When you feel a bite, hopefully, you pull it up.
[2665.28 → 2666.58] Voilà, fish.
[2667.54 → 2669.20] And you feel like you're a great fisherman.
[2669.82 → 2670.70] You caught a fish.
[2670.70 → 2675.82] And then he cooks it in this Chinese style with a whole fish with a head on and everything.
[2676.18 → 2678.64] And it's the most delicious fish you've ever tasted.
[2679.98 → 2683.36] But these are professional fishermen.
[2684.36 → 2692.68] And I imagine if you are a professional, it can be quite frustrating to come up empty in that thing that you are a professional at.
[2693.28 → 2699.32] It's like if we asked Paul to play the piano and all he can, like, get out was, you know, twinkle, twinkle, little star or something.
[2699.40 → 2700.50] He'd be like, you know, what's going on?
[2700.70 → 2707.00] Whereas I would go if I went fishing and didn't catch anything.
[2707.12 → 2707.86] Well, that makes sense.
[2709.06 → 2711.40] I just kind of feed the fish, you know, with a worm.
[2711.74 → 2713.76] And I have to keep putting more worms on to feed the fish.
[2715.26 → 2723.54] But for these disciples, they have to, you know, we have to understand that there is some frustration here as they are doing the thing that they are good at.
[2724.48 → 2729.06] Relying on their own strength and ability that they've always relied on, but they're catching nothing.
[2729.06 → 2738.94] And the whole scene is designed to highlight the reality that when we go it alone, when we try to work apart from Jesus, it just doesn't work.
[2738.94 → 2745.32] Now, of course, even if they did catch some fish, did it work?
[2745.32 → 2746.64] Sure, okay, they can eat.
[2746.70 → 2747.72] They can fill their bellies.
[2748.34 → 2749.10] But that's it.
[2749.16 → 2749.96] That's all they can do.
[2750.34 → 2750.98] They can eat.
[2751.08 → 2751.78] They can be full.
[2752.78 → 2754.62] But it's not really about the fishing.
[2754.62 → 2759.84] And we also know what that's like, you know, and we see it all the time.
[2760.56 → 2765.82] We all know people with full nets who are miserable without Jesus.
[2768.42 → 2770.60] Sure, we can do some stuff in our own strength.
[2771.94 → 2775.08] But without Jesus, it's almost, we can't do anything.
[2775.20 → 2775.84] It feels empty.
[2775.84 → 2784.08] And fishing is just what Peter does when he needs to go do something to be useful in his own strength.
[2784.44 → 2785.42] He goes fishing.
[2786.06 → 2787.14] He's good at it.
[2787.50 → 2789.28] And we all have something like that.
[2791.06 → 2795.28] And the next scene that happens proves that it's really not about the fishing
[2795.28 → 2799.12] because Peter actually just jumps out of the boat,
[2800.32 → 2803.12] abandons the fish when he recognizes that it's Jesus.
[2803.12 → 2805.28] So let's see what happens.
[2805.82 → 2806.44] Verse 4.
[2808.18 → 2810.18] Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore.
[2810.34 → 2812.38] The disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
[2813.10 → 2813.98] He called out to them,
[2814.54 → 2817.24] Friends, haven't you any fish?
[2818.64 → 2820.42] No, they answered.
[2820.98 → 2822.52] Now, if you didn't have any fish and someone said,
[2822.58 → 2823.02] Do you have any fish?
[2823.06 → 2823.84] How would you answer it?
[2825.30 → 2827.70] So you kind of read in that, you know, how they said the no.
[2829.14 → 2830.50] So the day is breaking, right?
[2830.54 → 2831.48] The sun's coming up.
[2831.52 → 2832.18] It's dawn.
[2833.14 → 2836.24] They're probably, you know, they've probably been fishing all night.
[2837.00 → 2839.44] And they have caught nothing.
[2840.32 → 2844.50] And it seems that Jesus is fully aware that they haven't caught any fish.
[2844.54 → 2847.82] He's not saying, like he doesn't know, do you have any fish?
[2848.16 → 2852.02] It's like, friends, you haven't caught any fish, have you?
[2853.80 → 2856.20] And their response is no.
[2856.20 → 2859.44] So look at what Jesus says in verse 6.
[2860.82 → 2864.18] He said, now, they still don't know its Jesus.
[2864.36 → 2866.44] So this guy on the shore is giving them fishing advice.
[2866.72 → 2868.46] Throw your net on the other side of the boat.
[2868.86 → 2869.86] Right, the right side.
[2870.10 → 2871.98] You know, right, left, not right or wrong.
[2872.12 → 2872.96] Right side of the boat.
[2872.96 → 2874.68] And you will find some fish.
[2874.68 → 2881.88] When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
[2881.88 → 2888.78] And this is, I think, immediately where déjà vu kicks in from Luke 5.
[2889.44 → 2891.00] Where they had caught nothing.
[2891.40 → 2893.42] Jesus tells them to put the net down again.
[2893.64 → 2897.40] And all of a sudden, the nets are near bursting with fish.
[2897.40 → 2905.02] And that is why in verse 7, it says, then the disciple whom Jesus loved, who's that?
[2905.88 → 2906.48] It's John.
[2906.80 → 2907.36] Okay, John.
[2907.50 → 2908.32] He called himself this.
[2909.20 → 2912.10] Said to Peter, it is the Lord.
[2913.48 → 2918.30] Now, how did John know that it was Jesus?
[2920.88 → 2923.10] You know, I think probably it was still dark.
[2923.42 → 2925.66] You know, they're out in a boat.
[2925.66 → 2927.38] The light is just coming up.
[2927.44 → 2928.34] There's this guy on the...
[2928.34 → 2929.48] They don't recognize that it's him.
[2929.52 → 2930.44] They can't see it's him.
[2931.12 → 2934.08] They didn't, like, recognize his voice.
[2934.22 → 2934.32] Right?
[2934.44 → 2935.46] Jesus spoke to them.
[2935.70 → 2937.50] They didn't realize it was Jesus then.
[2938.04 → 2940.06] So how did John know it was the Lord?
[2940.80 → 2943.72] He knew it was the Lord because of the net full of fish.
[2945.14 → 2945.38] Right?
[2945.62 → 2947.76] It wasn't, oh, it's just a little bit brighter now.
[2947.82 → 2948.96] I think I can make him out.
[2949.70 → 2952.14] No, John didn't know it was him
[2952.14 → 2955.88] until he saw what happened at Jesus' command
[2955.88 → 2959.60] and what happened as a result.
[2960.48 → 2963.84] And that's how he knew it was the Lord.
[2964.00 → 2965.54] Not Jesus, the Lord.
[2968.10 → 2968.58] Now,
[2969.58 → 2974.36] John is the one who has the more quick insight.
[2975.10 → 2975.34] Right?
[2975.38 → 2976.52] He notices things.
[2977.34 → 2979.12] And so he knew that it's Jesus on the shore.
[2979.20 → 2980.30] He's the first one to realize it.
[2980.34 → 2981.08] He's pulling in the fish.
[2981.36 → 2981.94] Déjà vu.
[2982.20 → 2983.12] This happened before.
[2983.96 → 2984.80] Miraculous catch of fish.
[2984.84 → 2985.52] It's the Lord.
[2986.20 → 2988.00] And he tells Peter, who's next to him.
[2988.46 → 2989.24] Now, what does Peter do?
[2989.32 → 2990.50] Peter's more of a man of action.
[2991.18 → 2993.48] You know, Peter's going at it in his own strength.
[2993.56 → 2994.70] He's got his tunic off.
[2995.46 → 2997.12] He grabs it around his waist.
[2997.24 → 2998.60] He dives into the water
[2998.60 → 2999.60] and just makes,
[3000.38 → 3001.38] swims right out,
[3001.78 → 3003.90] rushes toward Jesus,
[3004.42 → 3005.48] leaving the other disciples
[3005.48 → 3006.68] to take care of the fish.
[3008.56 → 3010.28] So, but they follow him.
[3010.38 → 3010.76] Verse 8.
[3011.46 → 3013.44] The other disciples followed in the boat,
[3013.60 → 3014.90] towing the net full of fish,
[3015.32 → 3016.60] for they were not far from shore,
[3016.68 → 3017.44] about a hundred yards.
[3017.98 → 3018.74] When they landed,
[3019.16 → 3021.64] they saw a fire of burning coals there
[3021.64 → 3022.90] with fish on it
[3022.90 → 3024.50] and some bread.
[3025.38 → 3026.48] So they all come ashore.
[3026.64 → 3028.92] Jesus has got breakfast ready for them.
[3029.10 → 3030.40] That's how I like my fishing trips.
[3031.16 → 3031.78] Come ashore.
[3032.58 → 3033.52] Breakfast is there.
[3033.96 → 3035.42] He's got some fish on the grill.
[3035.56 → 3036.46] He's got some bread.
[3036.54 → 3037.84] It must have smelled amazing.
[3038.02 → 3039.28] I love the smell of fresh bread.
[3040.32 → 3041.02] Grilled fish.
[3041.06 → 3042.04] I'm sure it smelled amazing.
[3043.14 → 3045.82] And this really is one of my favourite verses
[3045.82 → 3047.74] or passages in the whole Bible
[3047.74 → 3050.72] because I really think it shows us
[3050.72 → 3051.52] the heart of Jesus.
[3052.78 → 3054.46] Jesus is the kind of Lord
[3054.46 → 3056.62] who in his resurrection
[3056.62 → 3057.98] doesn't come up and say,
[3058.28 → 3059.96] I am the resurrected Lord.
[3060.42 → 3061.72] You know, bow before me or anything.
[3062.04 → 3062.88] No, what does he do?
[3063.36 → 3065.92] He cooks his disciples fish on the beach.
[3066.40 → 3069.22] That is the kind of Lord that Jesus is.
[3069.40 → 3070.82] And I think it's a beautiful picture
[3070.82 → 3074.54] of the kind of life that Jesus invites us into.
[3075.50 → 3076.28] And actually,
[3076.76 → 3077.84] so, you know,
[3077.86 → 3079.36] I told you about my trip to Israel
[3079.36 → 3080.44] a couple of years ago now.
[3080.66 → 3081.74] Can't believe how time flies.
[3081.74 → 3083.66] But we were on the Sea of Galilee
[3083.66 → 3084.74] and I got a photo here.
[3085.84 → 3086.72] Yeah, oh, it's hard to see.
[3086.94 → 3088.76] But so that's the Sea of Galilee.
[3088.96 → 3090.30] And we were just walking along there
[3090.30 → 3092.72] and there's actually a fire pit.
[3092.84 → 3093.82] You know, someone must have camped
[3093.82 → 3094.58] or built the fire.
[3094.94 → 3096.48] And so I just thought of this passage
[3096.48 → 3097.44] and I took this photo
[3097.44 → 3098.74] knowing one day
[3098.74 → 3099.80] I'm going to preach on this passage
[3099.80 → 3102.10] and I'm going to show you this photo.
[3102.68 → 3103.48] So here it is.
[3103.52 → 3104.50] I remember to do it.
[3105.64 → 3105.78] Yeah.
[3106.20 → 3107.96] So maybe, maybe that's where it was.
[3108.08 → 3108.30] Right?
[3108.36 → 3109.36] Jesus cooking the fish.
[3109.50 → 3110.30] No, probably not.
[3110.38 → 3112.08] But it was on the shore of Galilee.
[3115.92 → 3117.60] Now let's keep going in our passage
[3117.60 → 3118.48] and look at verse 10.
[3118.48 → 3120.76] Jesus said to them,
[3121.32 → 3122.92] bring some of the fish
[3122.92 → 3123.80] that you have just caught.
[3124.44 → 3126.52] So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat,
[3126.68 → 3127.72] dragged the net ashore.
[3128.04 → 3130.24] It was full of large fish, 153.
[3130.56 → 3131.76] But even with so many,
[3131.84 → 3132.66] the net was not torn.
[3133.38 → 3136.34] Now Peter is a strong man.
[3136.96 → 3137.30] Right?
[3137.36 → 3141.08] He hauls a net full of fish to shore.
[3141.20 → 3141.98] Like that's impressive.
[3142.76 → 3144.74] And notice also this detail
[3144.74 → 3145.58] that is being offered.
[3146.36 → 3148.10] John could have easily said,
[3148.48 → 3150.38] so Simon Peter went and dragged the net
[3150.38 → 3152.26] ashore full of large fish.
[3153.24 → 3154.24] Okay, that's enough.
[3154.78 → 3159.82] But he tells us they were 153 of them.
[3160.96 → 3163.04] And friends, this has caused no shortage
[3163.04 → 3164.66] of ink to be spilled
[3164.66 → 3168.16] by theologians and pastors over the years.
[3169.32 → 3170.94] And I will admit, initially,
[3171.14 → 3174.02] I thought 153 fish were listed.
[3174.36 → 3174.64] Why?
[3175.26 → 3177.16] Because there were 153 fish.
[3177.16 → 3178.78] It's a historical detail.
[3179.82 → 3181.32] And that makes sense.
[3181.38 → 3182.06] If you go fishing,
[3182.56 → 3183.66] you come back from a fishing trip,
[3183.74 → 3184.84] what's the first thing people ask?
[3185.54 → 3186.54] How many fish did you catch?
[3186.64 → 3187.46] So maybe John's like,
[3188.50 → 3189.88] he knows we're going to ask.
[3190.10 → 3191.22] He's just going to put it in there
[3191.22 → 3192.42] because we want to know.
[3192.72 → 3194.10] And it was amazing.
[3194.16 → 3195.62] We had 153 fish.
[3195.62 → 3197.58] It was an amazing fishing trip.
[3198.92 → 3200.66] But after looking at some commentaries,
[3200.76 → 3202.76] I'm not so convinced it's that simple.
[3204.18 → 3206.04] So I decided to go into this.
[3206.12 → 3207.44] I could have just forgotten it,
[3207.52 → 3208.36] but here it is.
[3208.44 → 3209.48] I'm going to share with you
[3209.48 → 3211.12] the best as I understand this.
[3211.52 → 3212.26] If you're not interested,
[3212.64 → 3213.50] you can go to sleep now,
[3213.90 → 3214.92] and I'll tell you when to wake up.
[3215.76 → 3217.18] But this is interesting.
[3217.36 → 3218.70] I know some of you are into this.
[3218.70 → 3220.86] So if you ask,
[3221.46 → 3223.14] where else in the Bible
[3223.14 → 3225.24] do we have a great catch of fish?
[3226.38 → 3229.68] One place you would go is Ezekiel 47,
[3230.00 → 3231.84] which we read earlier.
[3232.42 → 3234.68] Okay, so Ezekiel 47, verse 10,
[3235.02 → 3235.62] says this.
[3236.84 → 3240.12] Fishermen will stand beside the sea,
[3240.36 → 3241.06] the Sea of Galilee.
[3241.66 → 3243.64] From Ended to En-Eyelid,
[3244.28 → 3247.20] it will be a place for the spreading of nets.
[3247.20 → 3250.30] Its fish will be of very many kinds,
[3250.38 → 3252.60] like the fish of the great sea.
[3254.26 → 3254.56] Aha.
[3255.54 → 3259.22] So Ezekiel 47 is talking about the Messianic Age.
[3259.64 → 3261.00] Remember when we read all that,
[3261.08 → 3262.52] the water flowing from the temple,
[3262.86 → 3264.38] the trees growing by the side of the river,
[3264.76 → 3267.56] the fruit, Revelation 21, right?
[3267.64 → 3269.10] This is the Messianic Age.
[3270.84 → 3272.26] And so now you're in John,
[3272.34 → 3274.06] you come to this climactic passage
[3274.06 → 3275.26] at the end of the Gospel,
[3275.26 → 3277.48] and there's this great catch of fish,
[3278.30 → 3280.52] just like in Ezekiel 47.
[3281.06 → 3283.88] This is a fascinating intertextual parallel.
[3285.12 → 3287.02] But then you have this strange detail,
[3287.14 → 3288.28] 153 fish.
[3288.44 → 3289.56] What do we make of that?
[3290.18 → 3291.92] So the early church father,
[3292.72 → 3293.56] Augustine,
[3294.56 → 3299.90] notes that 153 is the triangular number of 17.
[3299.90 → 3302.20] That doesn't mean anything to me,
[3302.42 → 3304.28] but this is what I found out.
[3305.10 → 3307.32] Think about billiard balls, right?
[3307.32 → 3308.60] You have a rack of billiard balls.
[3308.78 → 3309.54] This makes a triangle.
[3310.06 → 3312.60] And if you have 17 rows like that,
[3312.72 → 3313.10] 17,
[3313.90 → 3314.82] then 16,
[3315.08 → 3315.66] and 15,
[3315.76 → 3316.30] and 14,
[3316.46 → 3318.04] and you add up all of those balls,
[3318.14 → 3318.88] how many do you get?
[3320.26 → 3320.62] 153.
[3321.30 → 3323.60] Okay, so 153 is the triangular number of 17.
[3324.28 → 3324.98] I asked my wife,
[3325.00 → 3325.60] who's a math teacher,
[3325.66 → 3325.94] she's like,
[3325.98 → 3326.94] I don't know what you're talking about.
[3326.94 → 3329.76] But this meant something to the ancients.
[3330.64 → 3330.94] Now,
[3331.18 → 3332.78] what you also have to know
[3332.78 → 3335.12] is that Hebrew letters convey numbers.
[3335.92 → 3338.34] So every Hebrew word actually has a number value.
[3339.00 → 3339.68] And what's interesting,
[3340.00 → 3341.90] if you look at Ezekiel 47.10,
[3342.44 → 3343.60] there are these two places.
[3345.26 → 3346.96] Ended and Glim.
[3347.22 → 3347.92] Glim, something.
[3348.68 → 3352.42] So the word Jedi in Hebrew amounts to the number 17,
[3352.42 → 3356.18] Glim, if you parse it out,
[3357.14 → 3357.94] can you guess,
[3358.84 → 3362.52] what is the value 153?
[3363.52 → 3364.70] So there you have it.
[3365.26 → 3365.36] Okay.
[3366.50 → 3366.80] Now,
[3367.54 → 3367.80] many,
[3367.92 → 3369.52] some of you love this stuff.
[3369.60 → 3369.76] You're like,
[3369.84 → 3370.14] wow.
[3370.96 → 3373.54] Others of you are skeptical.
[3373.90 → 3375.34] I can see the doubt on your faces.
[3376.84 → 3377.44] Unbelieving.
[3377.44 → 3382.76] But whether John knew when he wrote 153,
[3383.16 → 3384.98] and certainly the Christ
[3384.98 → 3387.78] who caused this miracle to happen
[3387.78 → 3390.46] could have caused exactly 153 fish.
[3391.04 → 3392.92] So I do believe it's a historical number.
[3393.66 → 3395.10] But at the same time,
[3395.70 → 3397.40] there's this very strong
[3397.40 → 3400.80] intertextual connection to Ezekiel 47.
[3400.80 → 3403.60] And John is drawing on the promises
[3403.60 → 3406.48] of the new covenant in Ezekiel 47.
[3407.44 → 3409.54] And his point is that the risen Jesus
[3409.54 → 3411.58] is the fulfillment of the new covenant.
[3412.32 → 3413.84] Jesus is the promised Messiah.
[3414.16 → 3416.08] He has ushered in the Messianic age.
[3416.50 → 3418.32] And there's going to be this great catch
[3418.32 → 3419.54] of men and women
[3419.54 → 3421.98] into the nets of the kingdom of God
[3421.98 → 3423.52] through the preaching of the gospel.
[3424.34 → 3425.90] That is what I think the point is.
[3425.90 → 3432.02] And even though there are so many fish,
[3432.42 → 3433.70] John 21 says,
[3434.06 → 3435.28] the net was not torn.
[3436.14 → 3439.06] If we want to further allegorize it,
[3440.06 → 3442.68] you could say not one will be lost.
[3443.78 → 3445.52] The net will not be torn.
[3446.24 → 3447.60] All of God's chosen people
[3447.60 → 3449.28] will be drawn into his kingdom.
[3449.62 → 3450.58] Not one will be lost.
[3451.28 → 3454.68] So now what are we supposed to grasp from this?
[3454.68 → 3456.46] Why does John give us this whole story
[3456.46 → 3457.58] of catching fish?
[3458.50 → 3460.44] And the answer is really quite simple, I think.
[3461.44 → 3462.86] Jesus had told his disciples,
[3463.28 → 3464.88] apart from me, you can do nothing.
[3465.60 → 3466.80] He has also told them,
[3467.40 → 3469.02] you will be fishers of men.
[3470.26 → 3471.64] They had gone out to fish
[3471.64 → 3472.72] in their own strength,
[3473.40 → 3475.30] in their own ability as professionals,
[3475.68 → 3476.58] working all night,
[3476.70 → 3477.96] giving everything they had,
[3478.96 → 3481.38] and they weren't able to catch anything.
[3481.38 → 3485.06] And if Jesus hadn't arrived
[3485.06 → 3487.20] and hadn't provided that catch of fish,
[3487.36 → 3488.98] they could have been fishing for days,
[3489.22 → 3489.96] or weeks,
[3490.12 → 3491.08] or years,
[3491.64 → 3493.78] and they wouldn't have caught a single fish
[3493.78 → 3496.02] if God in his providence
[3496.02 → 3498.40] withheld the fish from their nets.
[3500.08 → 3501.50] So it's not by accident
[3501.50 → 3502.54] that they came up empty,
[3502.66 → 3504.68] because Jesus was teaching them a lesson,
[3504.68 → 3508.00] that they will not be fishers of men
[3508.00 → 3509.62] unless he blesses them
[3509.62 → 3511.64] in their fishing of men.
[3513.02 → 3514.44] And that apart from him,
[3514.60 → 3515.62] they can do nothing.
[3515.76 → 3518.04] They have to abide with him
[3518.04 → 3519.46] as a vine in a branch.
[3520.72 → 3522.90] Only being connected to Jesus as a vine
[3522.90 → 3525.88] can our lives be fruitful for Jesus.
[3527.46 → 3528.66] And let's just admit it,
[3528.72 → 3531.16] that is sometimes the hardest thing
[3531.16 → 3533.04] for us about Christianity.
[3534.26 → 3534.50] Right?
[3534.54 → 3536.22] That we can't just muscle through it.
[3536.28 → 3537.92] We can't just kind of accomplish it,
[3538.00 → 3539.14] do it in our own strength.
[3539.38 → 3541.06] But that actually following Jesus,
[3541.66 → 3543.16] he never asks us to do anything
[3543.16 → 3544.04] in our own strength.
[3544.58 → 3546.62] And that frustrates our sense
[3546.62 → 3549.02] of self-sufficiency and independence.
[3550.56 → 3551.52] But he says,
[3552.08 → 3552.72] abide in me.
[3554.64 → 3555.98] Without me, you can do nothing.
[3556.78 → 3557.22] Right?
[3557.28 → 3558.58] When it comes to prayer,
[3559.14 → 3560.84] or living the Christian life,
[3561.16 → 3562.28] following God's commands,
[3562.68 → 3563.86] apart from you, you can do nothing.
[3565.44 → 3566.56] And so the lesson here for us
[3566.56 → 3567.56] is that following Jesus,
[3567.86 → 3569.46] even being on mission for Jesus
[3569.46 → 3570.22] as a church,
[3570.66 → 3573.50] it's about relying on him
[3573.50 → 3575.60] for our lives to be fruitful.
[3575.82 → 3577.56] For our church to be fruitful
[3577.56 → 3578.30] in our ministry,
[3578.54 → 3579.72] we have to rely on Jesus.
[3579.86 → 3580.68] It's not about techniques.
[3580.82 → 3582.00] It's not about programs.
[3582.52 → 3583.78] Sure, we can strategize.
[3583.90 → 3584.82] We can try things.
[3585.46 → 3586.58] But we have to be in prayer.
[3587.62 → 3589.20] And we have to look to him
[3589.20 → 3591.48] to make an impact for his kingdom.
[3594.22 → 3595.36] But it's also interesting.
[3595.60 → 3597.16] So that's one part of this whole thing.
[3597.26 → 3598.00] Like, apart from me,
[3598.04 → 3598.74] you can do nothing.
[3599.10 → 3600.16] But also notice
[3600.16 → 3604.40] that they will only ever catch fish
[3604.40 → 3605.52] with the blessing of Jesus,
[3606.06 → 3608.10] yet they still had to throw in the net,
[3608.18 → 3608.52] didn't they?
[3609.52 → 3609.74] Right?
[3609.94 → 3610.56] Jesus said,
[3610.66 → 3611.40] throw in the net.
[3611.76 → 3612.86] Haul in the fish.
[3613.36 → 3614.54] They still had to act.
[3615.04 → 3616.20] They still had to do stuff
[3616.20 → 3617.70] and think and obey.
[3619.54 → 3621.70] And so they're going to have to go out
[3621.70 → 3623.26] and actually preach the gospel.
[3625.02 → 3625.40] Right?
[3625.56 → 3626.46] So Jesus says,
[3626.54 → 3627.22] without me,
[3627.48 → 3628.74] there is no blessing
[3628.74 → 3630.38] that can come from this ministry
[3630.38 → 3631.14] that you have.
[3631.46 → 3632.54] It has to come from God.
[3632.86 → 3633.82] But on the other hand,
[3633.94 → 3635.26] we still have to do it.
[3636.64 → 3637.70] And so Jesus is teaching
[3637.70 → 3638.80] his disciples and us,
[3638.88 → 3640.26] you can do nothing apart from me,
[3640.26 → 3642.18] but he will bless us
[3642.18 → 3644.34] as we follow him and obey.
[3646.48 → 3647.72] And that's what these disciples
[3647.72 → 3648.42] are going to have to do.
[3648.50 → 3649.62] They're going to have to go out and preach.
[3649.96 → 3651.18] They're going to have to go out and pray
[3651.18 → 3652.26] and plant churches.
[3652.48 → 3653.74] And they're going to suffer for Jesus.
[3654.06 → 3654.94] They're going to be persecuted
[3654.94 → 3656.02] and die for him
[3656.02 → 3658.90] to bring many fish
[3658.90 → 3661.06] into the kingdom of God.
[3662.94 → 3663.32] And you know,
[3663.36 → 3664.64] this is such a beautiful description
[3664.64 → 3665.94] of the church's mission.
[3666.92 → 3667.04] Right?
[3667.20 → 3668.28] Must we pray?
[3668.82 → 3669.86] Yes, we have to pray.
[3670.60 → 3672.62] Must we give money
[3672.62 → 3674.66] so that the gospel can go forth
[3674.66 → 3677.36] through all of these missionaries
[3677.36 → 3679.42] and organizations that we support?
[3679.54 → 3681.18] Yes, we're supporting the work of the kingdom.
[3681.46 → 3682.06] If we don't give,
[3682.14 → 3682.94] these missionaries,
[3683.26 → 3684.56] missions can't do the work
[3684.56 → 3685.62] that God has called them to do.
[3686.12 → 3687.98] Must we share the gospel
[3687.98 → 3689.44] with our friends and neighbours?
[3690.12 → 3690.60] Absolutely.
[3692.28 → 3693.90] If we don't do those things,
[3694.62 → 3696.10] but if we don't do those things,
[3697.16 → 3698.26] God will not bless us.
[3698.74 → 3698.84] Right?
[3698.84 → 3701.18] The disciples are not just sitting in the boat
[3701.18 → 3702.80] and fish are just falling from heaven
[3702.80 → 3704.12] and filling up the boat.
[3704.20 → 3704.40] They're like,
[3704.44 → 3705.10] we don't have to do anything.
[3705.16 → 3706.06] God blesses us from heaven.
[3706.86 → 3707.24] No.
[3707.46 → 3707.60] Right?
[3707.68 → 3708.80] They're throwing their nets in.
[3708.86 → 3709.94] They're hauling in the fish.
[3710.38 → 3711.96] And Jesus blesses them
[3711.96 → 3713.12] as they do it.
[3713.12 → 3718.58] And that means for us,
[3718.92 → 3719.50] you and me,
[3719.58 → 3721.58] we have to talk about the hope
[3721.58 → 3722.62] that is within us
[3722.62 → 3723.80] to other people.
[3724.68 → 3726.02] Because if we don't,
[3726.58 → 3727.64] how are they going to come?
[3729.22 → 3730.58] How are they going to believe?
[3730.68 → 3732.06] Let's not be hyper-Calvinists.
[3732.60 → 3732.80] Right?
[3732.82 → 3734.36] We need to preach the gospel.
[3734.44 → 3735.18] We need to share.
[3735.76 → 3737.84] And we do trust that God will bring
[3737.84 → 3739.00] those whom he has chosen
[3739.00 → 3740.14] into his kingdom
[3740.14 → 3742.96] through the sharing of the gospel.
[3743.28 → 3744.28] But it has to be shared.
[3746.86 → 3747.76] So let's summarize.
[3749.46 → 3751.50] Jesus comes to be with us
[3751.50 → 3753.26] as his disciples.
[3753.48 → 3753.60] Right?
[3753.66 → 3754.82] This is the risen Jesus.
[3755.68 → 3757.04] He comes to be present,
[3757.20 → 3758.14] abide with us,
[3758.16 → 3758.62] in us,
[3758.68 → 3759.92] and through us.
[3759.92 → 3762.56] And he says to us today,
[3762.98 → 3764.94] I will make you fishers of men.
[3765.84 → 3766.36] And he says,
[3766.44 → 3767.16] apart from me,
[3767.22 → 3767.94] you can do nothing.
[3769.36 → 3771.22] And so you and I
[3771.22 → 3772.64] go out with the strength
[3772.64 → 3774.14] that God provides.
[3774.80 → 3775.90] And we cast our nets
[3775.90 → 3776.60] into the waters.
[3777.26 → 3778.66] And we will bring in
[3778.66 → 3779.96] a great catch of fish,
[3780.08 → 3781.00] all kinds of fish,
[3781.28 → 3782.46] into Jesus' kingdom
[3782.46 → 3784.14] as we rely on him.
[3785.52 → 3785.72] Okay?
[3785.82 → 3786.36] So let's pray.
[3789.92 → 3791.14] Lord, we thank you
[3791.14 → 3791.74] for such,
[3792.68 → 3794.04] the message of hope
[3794.04 → 3796.04] because of the resurrection
[3796.04 → 3797.60] of Jesus,
[3798.10 → 3800.04] where when Jesus shows up,
[3800.10 → 3801.26] everything starts to blossom.
[3803.24 → 3806.10] And it's not a message
[3806.10 → 3808.04] that you just thunder down
[3808.04 → 3808.64] from heaven,
[3809.46 → 3811.98] but one that you entrust
[3811.98 → 3813.02] to your servants, us.
[3813.56 → 3814.74] And you send us out
[3814.74 → 3815.66] with this message
[3815.66 → 3817.94] so that your kingdom
[3817.94 → 3819.14] would become full.
[3820.38 → 3820.74] And Lord,
[3820.80 → 3821.42] would you help us
[3821.42 → 3822.32] to first be changed
[3822.32 → 3823.16] by this message,
[3824.26 → 3825.50] and then would you bless us
[3825.50 → 3826.20] as we go out
[3826.20 → 3827.10] and share it with others.
[3827.94 → 3828.74] We pray all this
[3828.74 → 3830.62] for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[3830.70 → 3831.02] our Lord.
[3831.38 → 3831.68] Amen.
[3831.68 → 3831.78] Amen.
[3831.78 → 3831.82] Amen.

[3877.92 → 3879.26] Amen.
[3879.26 → 3879.90] Amen.
[3879.90 → 3886.38] Oh God, that God's not all.
[3889.22 → 3896.28] I need you, oh I need you.
[3896.84 → 3901.90] Every hour I need you.
[3901.90 → 3908.36] My God defends my righteousness.
[3908.36 → 3913.94] Oh God, how I need you.
[3918.04 → 3924.60] Where sin comes deep, our grace is born.
[3924.60 → 3931.08] Where sin's found is near the Lord.
[3931.66 → 3937.02] And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[3937.02 → 3943.60] Holiness is Christ in me.
[3945.10 → 3950.02] You are, Lord, I am free.
[3951.16 → 3956.66] Holiness is Christ in me.
[3956.66 → 3963.24] Oh God, I need you.
[3963.24 → 3967.24] Oh God, I need you.
[3967.24 → 3973.82] Every hour I need you.
[3973.82 → 3979.24] My mind defends my righteousness.
[3979.24 → 3985.82] Oh God, I need you.
[3985.82 → 3992.40] Oh God, I need you.
[3992.40 → 3993.40] Jesus, you are, Lord.
[3993.40 → 3994.40] I need you.
[3994.40 → 3996.40] Jesus, you are, Lord.
[3996.40 → 3996.98] I need you.
[3996.98 → 3998.40] Jesus, you are, Lord.
[3998.40 → 3999.40] I need you.
[3999.40 → 4000.40] Jesus, you are, Lord.
[4000.40 → 4002.40] I need you.
[4002.40 → 4005.22] And when I can't stand up for all I need.
[4005.98 → 4011.34] Jesus, you are my hope and stay.
[4011.34 → 4018.34] And with the hand of standoff, all I need
[4018.34 → 4023.86] Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[4023.86 → 4034.34] Lord, I need you, Lord, I need you
[4034.34 → 4040.34] Every hour I need you
[4041.34 → 4047.34] My one defence, my righteousness
[4047.34 → 4053.34] O God, how I need you
[4053.34 → 4060.34] Lord, I need you
[4060.34 → 4066.34] Every hour I need you
[4066.34 → 4072.34] My one defence, my righteousness
[4072.34 → 4078.34] O God, how I need you
[4078.34 → 4084.34] My one defence, my righteousness
[4084.34 → 4092.34] O God, how I need you
[4092.34 → 4096.34] You may be seated
[4096.34 → 4117.38] Continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings. And you know, again, the Lord uses this means of obedience to bless us and to bless the work of his kingdom.
[4117.38 → 4130.38] And our designated offering for today is there. It's Rise Up Global Ministries, which is an umbrella organization as part of our Christian Reformed Church. So can I ask the deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering?
[4130.38 → 4132.38] Thank you.
[4132.38 → 4136.38] Thank you.
[4136.38 → 4138.38] Thank you.
[4138.38 → 4142.38] Thank you.
[4142.38 → 4144.38] Thank you.
[4144.38 → 4146.38] Thank you.
[4146.38 → 4150.38] Thank you.
[4150.38 → 4152.38] Thank you.
[4152.38 → 4153.38] Thank you.
[4153.38 → 4165.38] Thank you.
[4165.38 → 4166.38] Thank you.
[4166.38 → 4168.38] Amen.
[4196.38 → 4198.38] Amen.
[4226.38 → 4228.38] Amen.
[4256.38 → 4258.38] Amen.
[4258.38 → 4260.38] Amen.
[4260.38 → 4262.38] Amen.
[4262.38 → 4264.38] Amen.
[4264.38 → 4266.38] Amen.
[4266.38 → 4268.38] Amen.
[4268.38 → 4270.38] Amen.
[4270.38 → 4272.38] Amen.
[4272.38 → 4274.38] Amen.
[4274.38 → 4276.38] Amen.
[4276.38 → 4280.38] So we'll come to a time of our community prayer.
[4280.38 → 4284.38] We pray for some of the needs in our own community and around the world.
[4284.38 → 4294.38] And before we do so, there is some sad news to let you know that Amy Iron, sister of Jake Iron, and related to many, some others in our congregation,
[4294.38 → 4300.38] she passed away on, is it Friday evening or Saturday morning?
[4300.38 → 4301.38] Just recently here.
[4301.38 → 4307.38] So we'll pray for Jake and even Jim and others in our congregation.
[4307.38 → 4315.38] And I never met Amy and WIM and the family, but I know that they were, you know, integral part of this church for a long time.
[4315.38 → 4319.38] And so let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[4319.38 → 4324.38] And we remember as we come before him that we are his children.
[4324.38 → 4325.38] Right?
[4325.38 → 4331.38] We have been adopted as sons and daughters by his grace into his kingdom.
[4331.38 → 4335.38] And so let's come before him as his children in prayer.
[4335.38 → 4337.38] Let's pray.
[4337.38 → 4349.38] Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have, that you remind us that we are your children, that we've been adopted by your grace.
[4349.38 → 4353.38] And through Jesus, we are heirs to the kingdom of God.
[4353.38 → 4361.38] And Lord, we have many things on our hearts today as we look at our community and the world around us.
[4361.38 → 4370.38] And Lord, first, we pray for Jake, especially as he grieves the loss of his sister, Amy.
[4370.38 → 4374.38] Lord, we pray that we'd be also with Amy's family, WIM, and their children.
[4374.38 → 4383.38] Lord, we lift them up to you in prayer, looking to you, the God who binds up the wounds of the brokenhearted,
[4383.38 → 4388.38] the God who can comfort us, the God who promises that there is resurrection life.
[4388.38 → 4395.38] But Lord, in this time of turmoil, when we feel the deep sadness of loss, Lord, would you comfort Jake
[4395.38 → 4401.38] and all those who knew and loved Amy as well, friends and family members of our congregation.
[4401.38 → 4408.38] And Lord, we also, we look to the news where there are so many things that hurt our hearts.
[4408.38 → 4412.38] And we think again of all the things happening in the Middle East.
[4412.38 → 4420.38] This has been going on for a long time now, but we continue to pray for Palestine and Israel and Iran and Syria
[4420.38 → 4425.38] and just the ever-changing situation that's going on there.
[4425.38 → 4433.38] We ask God that you would continue to exercise your sovereign authority over that situation.
[4433.38 → 4438.38] Lord, we ask for mercy for those who are innocent and caught up in this.
[4438.38 → 4444.38] We ask for leaders to stand up and bring change and to bring peace.
[4444.38 → 4448.38] We pray also for those who are hurting and suffering in those places.
[4448.38 → 4455.38] We ask for those who are hurting and hurting and hurting and hurting and hurting and hurting and hurting and hurting.
[4455.38 → 4459.38] And Lord, also would you turn many hearts toward you because you are the Prince of Peace.
[4459.38 → 4464.38] We ask, Lord, also for your blessing over the leadership of our own country, Canada.
[4464.38 → 4473.38] Lord, we are often quick to criticize and critique things happening in our own government when we read the news.
[4473.38 → 4483.38] But Lord, we also know in your scripture that we are to submit ourselves to pray for and honour the government that you have instituted over us.
[4483.38 → 4489.38] So we ask, Lord, that you would bless our leaders federally, provincially as well, our leaders in Delta.
[4489.38 → 4496.38] We ask, Lord, that your truth and grace would be at work in their hearts.
[4496.38 → 4501.38] That your word would be a light to them and maybe, Lord, bring people around them who are Christians.
[4501.38 → 4503.38] There are Christians in government.
[4503.38 → 4505.38] There are also some who are not Christians.
[4505.38 → 4510.38] But Lord, would your ways and truth and light be known in those places?
[4510.38 → 4517.38] And Lord, we also ask that as a church that you would bless our ministry.
[4517.38 → 4522.38] We thank you for what you are doing at our church, that we get to be part of this kingdom work here.
[4522.38 → 4527.38] And Lord, we acknowledge that we can do nothing apart from you.
[4527.38 → 4532.38] And so, Lord, help us to abide in you and help us to rely on you.
[4532.38 → 4545.38] And Lord, as we do so and as we go out as your disciples and share the gospel and pray and give and worship, Lord, that you would bless us.
[4545.38 → 4550.38] Lord, we can't demand that you do so because we do certain things.
[4550.38 → 4555.38] But Lord, we look to you, and we ask for your blessing upon the ministry of our church.
[4555.38 → 4562.38] And we ask all this also in the name of Jesus, our Lord, who taught us to pray, sing together the Lord's Prayer.
[4562.38 → 4567.38] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4567.38 → 4571.38] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
