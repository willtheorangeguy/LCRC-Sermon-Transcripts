[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 185.72] Well, good morning, everyone.
[186.62 → 189.06] And welcome to our service today.
[189.16 → 197.36] And especially if you're visiting with us here, we're blessed by your presence and trust that we can in turn be a blessing to you through the service today.
[197.78 → 198.92] My name is Jake Iron.
[198.92 → 207.90] I'll be orchestrating, as it were, this morning's service before Pastor Jason leads us in the next instalment of the Preparing the Way Advent Sermon Series.
[207.90 → 211.16] Just a few announcements before we begin.
[211.76 → 213.94] First and foremost, where are they?
[214.72 → 221.52] Congratulations to Bart and Adriana Vanderkamp, who are celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary today.
[222.70 → 223.14] Yeah, right.
[227.46 → 235.18] In celebration, they invite you to join them for some refreshments and cake, I believe, in the Fellowship Hall after the service.
[235.18 → 246.08] And, of course, a big week coming up, our Christmas Eve service on 630, or at 630 on Tuesday, the 24th.
[246.28 → 251.84] And then Christmas Day service following that the next day on the 25th, of course, at 10 a.m.
[251.84 → 257.02] And lastly, but not least, you may have noticed them come trooping in.
[257.36 → 262.16] We've got a special treat a little later in the service with the children's choir, so that's always super special.
[262.50 → 264.30] So thank you in advance for that.
[265.96 → 268.96] At this point, I'm going to invite BEV and John Bannister to come up.
[269.16 → 275.78] They're going to light the Advent calendar, or candle, not calendar.
[275.78 → 299.60] Because of the tender mercy of our God, the sunrise shall visit us from on high
[299.60 → 306.72] to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[310.96 → 312.58] Prepare the way of the Lord.
[313.10 → 319.48] We light this candle in peace, the peace that Jesus, our Saviour, gives to the world.
[320.24 → 323.78] He has reconciled us to the Father and to one another.
[324.78 → 325.06] Amen.
[325.76 → 326.94] Come, Lord Jesus.
[326.94 → 327.26] Amen.
[329.60 → 352.58] Please join me in prayer.
[357.02 → 359.14] God of majesty and power,
[359.14 → 361.84] who spoke, and this world was,
[362.80 → 365.06] who breathed, and this world lived,
[365.88 → 368.18] who counts the hairs upon our head,
[368.96 → 374.24] who sees our thoughts and reads our hearts,
[374.52 → 376.64] who loves us more than we deserve.
[377.46 → 380.98] How can we not bring today our sacrifice of praise?
[380.98 → 388.26] For in the child at Bethlehem lies the promise of intimacy with a Saviour who would die even for me,
[388.86 → 392.78] and the promise of an eternity in which to praise you more each day.
[393.70 → 396.18] God of promise, we praise your name.
[396.70 → 396.92] Amen.
[396.92 → 397.04] Amen.
[398.30 → 401.94] And now is a good time to stand, if you are able, and greet those around you.
[401.94 → 402.06] Amen.
[402.06 → 402.08] And now is a good time to stand, if you are able, and greet those around you.

[708.20 → 710.10] who led us to the Lord's ¿IGA?
[732.20 → 732.76] throne
[732.76 → 746.24] Gloria, in a church's nation
[746.24 → 760.44] Gloria, in a church's nation
[762.76 → 767.66] Don't you get to heaven's sea
[767.66 → 772.08] Jesus' birth, the age of shame
[772.08 → 776.54] Till the truth is broken, yet pain

[807.74 → 808.74] Gloria, in a church's nation
[808.74 → 823.50] Please join me in a prayer of confession
[823.50 → 832.32] Holy and loving God, we have dwelt in darkness and preferred it to the light
[832.32 → 837.70] We have been proud of our accomplishments and despaired over our shortcomings
[837.70 → 843.14] Smooth down the mountains of our pride and lift the valleys of our doubts
[843.14 → 849.18] Open a path in the wilderness of our lives that we might find our way to you again
[849.18 → 854.68] Refine us and prepare us once again for life in your kingdom
[854.68 → 856.66] Hear our prayer, O Lord
[856.66 → 857.64] Amen
[857.64 → 864.42] So coupled with confession comes an assurance of pardon from our Lord
[864.42 → 867.94] And that this morning is from Isaiah chapter 40
[867.94 → 872.38] Comfort, comfort my people, says your God
[872.38 → 877.42] Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and cry to her that her warfare is ended
[877.42 → 880.42] That her iniquity is pardoned
[880.42 → 884.84] That she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins
[884.84 → 889.42] A voice cries, in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord
[889.42 → 893.34] Make straight in the desert a highway for our God
[893.34 → 895.72] Every valley shall be lifted
[895.72 → 898.70] And every mountain and hill be made low
[898.70 → 901.60] The uneven ground shall become level
[901.60 → 903.82] And the rough places a plain
[903.82 → 907.26] And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed
[907.26 → 909.92] And all flesh shall see it together
[909.92 → 912.38] For the mouth of the Lord has spoken
[912.38 → 914.96] Brothers and sisters
[914.96 → 918.14] Our God loves us and pardons us
[918.14 → 921.38] Let's respond to that great promise with our next song
[921.38 → 923.10] Hark to herald angels sing
[923.10 → 925.58] And after that we'll look forward to the children's choir
[925.58 → 928.42] Hark to herald angels sing
[928.42 → 929.96] Glory to the newborn King
[929.96 → 930.98] Peace on earth
[930.98 → 932.32] And mercy mild
[932.32 → 935.42] God and sinners reconciled

[1735.18 → 1737.18] Now you can choose to go to Sunday school
[1737.18 → 1739.18] You can choose to go to Sunday school
[1739.18 → 1743.42] Or go to Sundays
[1743.42 → 1744.22] and maybe take a break Hopefully you have a break
[1744.22 → 1746.02] The Lord is quitting
[1746.02 → 1776.00] Thank you.
[1776.02 → 1806.00] Thank you.
[1806.02 → 1812.00] Advent is about the coming or the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1813.04 → 1815.14] And there are three aspects of that.
[1815.60 → 1819.44] There's his first coming, the incarnation 2,000 years ago.
[1819.66 → 1824.40] There's his future coming, which will happen at some point in the future.
[1825.32 → 1832.54] And then there is his coming every day of our lives through the Holy Spirit as he comes to us.
[1833.48 → 1836.56] And in Advent, one of the questions that we ask is this.
[1836.72 → 1838.36] Okay, Christ is coming.
[1838.86 → 1840.14] He is drawing near.
[1840.14 → 1844.86] So now how do we prepare to meet him?
[1845.80 → 1849.40] How do we prepare for him to draw near?
[1849.70 → 1850.64] How do we get ready?
[1851.84 → 1858.60] And to help us consider these questions, we are in a sermon series for this season called Preparing the Way.
[1858.60 → 1862.50] And we're looking at the ministry of John the Baptist.
[1863.24 → 1870.08] John is actually a central figure in Advent because his life's calling was to tell people,
[1870.26 → 1871.74] hey, God is coming.
[1872.30 → 1873.30] God is coming.
[1873.50 → 1876.02] Get ready to meet your Messiah.
[1876.02 → 1880.96] Now, the colour of Advent is purple.
[1881.36 → 1885.14] That's why we have these, many of the Advent candles are purple.
[1885.74 → 1888.24] Because it's the colour of royalty.
[1889.26 → 1889.36] Right?
[1889.52 → 1892.32] Kings and queens wore purple.
[1893.32 → 1900.68] And this is the way that the church, we remind ourselves that, oh, our king is coming to us.
[1901.44 → 1902.84] Jesus is the true king.
[1902.92 → 1904.26] He is the king of the world.
[1904.26 → 1906.42] He is our king.
[1907.06 → 1909.00] And he is coming to us.
[1909.80 → 1914.14] And that was John's calling, to prepare the people of God to receive their king.
[1914.46 → 1919.82] So let's open our Bibles to the Gospel of Luke today.
[1920.44 → 1928.10] You may feel free to use your pew Bible and turn to the Gospel of Luke, or you can follow along on the screen.
[1928.60 → 1932.88] We are in Luke chapter 3, and we'll read verses 1 to 6.
[1932.88 → 1937.24] That is on page 763 of your Brown Pew Bible.
[1937.48 → 1938.48] Page 763.
[1941.84 → 1945.94] And we will read Luke chapter 3, verses 1 through 6.
[1945.94 → 1954.20] In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea,
[1954.86 → 1961.12] Herod, Tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip, Tetrarch of Etruria and Taconites,
[1961.12 → 1964.28] and Licentiate, Tetrarch of Abilene.
[1964.28 → 1973.42] During the high priesthood of Anna's and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, son of Zechariah, in the desert.
[1974.12 → 1981.12] He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[1981.12 → 1985.02] As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
[1985.72 → 1987.68] A voice of one calling in the desert,
[1988.26 → 1990.22] Prepare the way for the Lord.
[1990.62 → 1992.02] Make straight paths for him.
[1992.64 → 1994.32] Every valley shall be filled in,
[1994.68 → 1996.74] Every mountain and hill made low.
[1997.30 → 1999.66] The crooked roads shall become straight,
[2000.24 → 2001.64] The rough ways smooth,
[2002.22 → 2005.96] And all mankind will see God's salvation.
[2005.96 → 2008.08] This is the word of the Lord.
[2010.18 → 2014.92] Would you join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[2015.54 → 2021.66] Father, we give you thanks that we can gather together under your word, under your authority,
[2022.70 → 2023.86] and together as your people.
[2025.18 → 2028.46] As we open your word, we ask that you would apply it to our minds,
[2028.56 → 2031.24] that we might not grow shallow.
[2032.04 → 2033.38] Apply it to our hearts,
[2033.80 → 2035.34] that we may not grow cold.
[2035.96 → 2038.30] And Lord, apply it to our feet and our hands,
[2039.18 → 2042.82] that we may not just be hearers of the word,
[2042.92 → 2043.74] but doers as well.
[2044.18 → 2045.64] And we ask this in Jesus' name.
[2046.00 → 2046.28] Amen.
[2047.50 → 2050.60] So John the Baptist has this good news to proclaim.
[2051.64 → 2053.60] God is coming to be with us.
[2053.96 → 2060.56] He's coming into our world so that he can dwell with us and abide with us, his people.
[2060.56 → 2064.28] And the ministry of John the Baptist was to prepare,
[2064.86 → 2068.68] help us to prepare our own hearts for Christ.
[2069.18 → 2070.88] You know, it's like that Christmas carol,
[2071.52 → 2072.70] Joy to the World.
[2072.78 → 2073.26] It says,
[2073.84 → 2076.04] Let every heart do what?
[2076.74 → 2078.70] Prepare, rejoice, yes.
[2078.78 → 2081.04] But also, prepare him room.
[2081.62 → 2083.30] Let every heart prepare him room.
[2083.30 → 2086.58] And so today, as we explore the ministry of John the Baptist,
[2086.74 → 2089.22] I have two points I want us to consider together.
[2089.66 → 2091.66] First, the place of preparation.
[2092.50 → 2094.54] And then secondly, the path of preparation.
[2095.16 → 2096.90] Okay, we are preparing the way for the Lord.
[2096.98 → 2098.18] So we need to know the place.
[2098.52 → 2099.58] Where do we meet him?
[2099.58 → 2100.96] And also the path.
[2101.06 → 2103.46] How do we actually receive him?
[2104.08 → 2106.96] So first, let's begin with the place of preparation.
[2108.12 → 2113.78] And I love the way that Luke sets up the coming of Jesus the Messiah.
[2114.08 → 2115.66] Look with me at verse 1.
[2116.48 → 2117.00] Again,
[2117.00 → 2136.00] So Luke here, he's a historian.
[2136.50 → 2139.58] He's a social commenter.
[2140.36 → 2143.22] And he is covering here the whole political landscape,
[2143.22 → 2147.36] the whole org chart of the Roman Empire at the time.
[2147.56 → 2149.02] Maybe not the assistant managers,
[2149.36 → 2151.46] but he's got all the top players.
[2152.16 → 2155.38] And he is talking about the most important people,
[2155.82 → 2156.98] politically, at the time.
[2157.46 → 2160.48] These are the people who are powerful,
[2160.96 → 2161.84] and rich,
[2162.26 → 2163.26] and influential.
[2164.28 → 2169.08] So here's a picture of the palace of Tiberius,
[2169.40 → 2172.88] who Luke says was the Roman emperor at this time.
[2173.22 → 2176.26] This is one of his summer villas.
[2176.76 → 2179.16] And you can see the ruins there in the foreground.
[2179.42 → 2181.32] You can just imagine how massive,
[2182.10 → 2184.82] how magnificent this structure would have been.
[2185.34 → 2187.24] It's on the island of Capri.
[2187.80 → 2188.90] It's beautiful.
[2189.48 → 2189.66] Right?
[2189.78 → 2192.78] And this is where the Roman emperor would summer,
[2193.22 → 2194.40] on the island of Capri,
[2194.58 → 2196.38] on this cliff overlooking the ocean.
[2197.32 → 2200.06] Now, Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judea,
[2200.06 → 2203.10] and he had an official residence in Caesarea,
[2203.28 → 2204.42] on the Mediterranean coast.
[2204.60 → 2207.12] Probably not quite as spectacular as that,
[2207.20 → 2209.24] but still a beach resort.
[2210.60 → 2213.80] And then Luke mentions these two sons of Herod the Great.
[2214.32 → 2215.10] And if you remember,
[2215.30 → 2218.00] Herod built the palace in Jerusalem,
[2218.00 → 2219.66] at the same time he built the temple.
[2220.36 → 2223.40] So again, this magnificent, stately palace.
[2223.40 → 2227.90] And you would expect that the world's king,
[2228.36 → 2231.44] he would come to one of these palaces, right?
[2232.16 → 2233.98] Like, that's where kings go.
[2234.08 → 2235.80] They go to palaces.
[2236.56 → 2239.16] They don't hang out with us peons.
[2239.66 → 2240.84] They go to palaces.
[2241.62 → 2242.86] But Luke tells us,
[2243.02 → 2246.56] no, he's not coming to any of those places.
[2246.56 → 2248.14] When Jesus comes,
[2248.34 → 2250.92] where does the true king come?
[2252.34 → 2253.92] Luke tells us in verse 2,
[2255.14 → 2260.90] during the high priesthood of Ennis and Caiaphas,
[2261.32 → 2263.34] the word of God came to John,
[2263.48 → 2264.38] son of Zechariah,
[2265.30 → 2265.94] in the wilderness.
[2268.24 → 2270.42] Now, when we think of wilderness,
[2270.64 → 2271.48] I don't know about you,
[2271.60 → 2272.70] but when I think of wilderness,
[2272.70 → 2272.90] wilderness,
[2273.50 → 2274.92] you might think of,
[2275.32 → 2276.66] well, the dike isn't a wilderness,
[2276.94 → 2277.44] but, you know,
[2277.68 → 2279.30] maybe taking a walk on the dike,
[2279.66 → 2281.16] getting out into nature.
[2281.76 → 2282.80] Or we might think of
[2282.80 → 2284.10] going up to Stanley Park,
[2284.92 → 2286.38] hiking or biking around,
[2286.48 → 2287.50] or going up to Seymour,
[2287.92 → 2288.52] Mount Seymour,
[2288.62 → 2289.66] or anywhere else.
[2290.50 → 2291.68] When we think of the wilderness,
[2291.84 → 2292.94] it's often as a place
[2292.94 → 2294.26] to enjoy God's creation,
[2295.08 → 2295.22] right?
[2295.26 → 2296.60] To be replenished,
[2296.74 → 2298.14] to take in a deep breath,
[2298.14 → 2301.00] and to kind of get a renewed sense of vibrancy.
[2301.00 → 2303.22] And so we might, you know,
[2303.32 → 2305.72] hear the word of God came to Zechariah
[2305.72 → 2306.40] in the wilderness,
[2306.86 → 2309.00] and we might intuitively think
[2309.00 → 2311.16] the word of God came to John
[2311.16 → 2312.56] on a pleasant hike.
[2313.16 → 2314.42] Well, he was enjoying nature,
[2314.54 → 2315.40] and the birds were singing.
[2316.58 → 2319.36] But that's not the wilderness for John.
[2319.98 → 2322.14] The wilderness was not a place of leisure.
[2322.38 → 2323.58] It wasn't a place of enjoyment.
[2324.84 → 2326.60] You know, so rather than the lush,
[2326.86 → 2329.02] you know, wilderness of the Pacific Northwest,
[2329.02 → 2331.48] we should imagine a desert.
[2332.48 → 2336.02] You know, it's a kind of howling wasteland,
[2336.76 → 2339.36] untamed, uninhabited.
[2340.44 → 2341.66] And in the imagination,
[2342.04 → 2344.24] and in the history of the people of God,
[2344.98 → 2348.86] the wilderness had another connotation as well.
[2349.52 → 2352.76] It was not only a place of disturbing discomfort,
[2352.76 → 2356.64] it was also the place of disobedience.
[2357.56 → 2358.70] Think about this.
[2359.46 → 2362.40] Adam and Eve are cast out of the garden,
[2362.70 → 2363.64] and where do they go?
[2364.98 → 2368.00] They go out of the cultivated place,
[2368.04 → 2369.40] out of the Garden of Eden,
[2370.16 → 2373.40] into the wilderness of the rest of the world,
[2373.48 → 2374.72] away from God's presence.
[2374.72 → 2376.72] And remember,
[2376.86 → 2379.12] the defining story of the people of Israel
[2379.12 → 2380.70] is the Exodus.
[2381.60 → 2383.20] Right after God had graciously,
[2383.44 → 2384.02] and dramatically,
[2384.26 → 2387.32] and powerfully liberated the Israelites
[2387.32 → 2389.36] from their oppressors in Egypt,
[2389.80 → 2391.14] God led them where?
[2392.52 → 2394.26] Into the Sinai wilderness.
[2395.52 → 2396.84] And it didn't take long
[2396.84 → 2398.54] before the first committee
[2398.54 → 2400.10] was formed in the Bible.
[2400.10 → 2401.62] And they were called
[2401.62 → 2403.62] the Back to Egypt Committee.
[2404.60 → 2407.16] And they started grumbling against Moses
[2407.16 → 2408.94] that God had led them out
[2408.94 → 2411.48] into this wilderness to die.
[2412.70 → 2415.10] And that they would have been better off
[2415.10 → 2416.84] back in Egypt.
[2418.16 → 2420.14] And the resentment towards God
[2420.14 → 2421.94] only grows as time goes on.
[2421.98 → 2423.12] And after many warnings,
[2423.12 → 2424.94] and after many second chances,
[2425.68 → 2427.58] finally the disobedience
[2427.58 → 2429.38] of this generation
[2429.38 → 2431.36] prevented them from entering
[2431.36 → 2432.54] into the promised land.
[2433.68 → 2435.34] And God kept them in the wilderness
[2435.34 → 2437.02] for 40 years.
[2438.36 → 2440.60] So the entire first generation
[2440.60 → 2441.92] of those who left Egypt
[2441.92 → 2444.06] passed away in the wilderness.
[2445.54 → 2447.48] So in Israel's story,
[2447.60 → 2448.40] Israel's history,
[2448.72 → 2450.86] when you hear this word wilderness,
[2451.82 → 2453.38] there's an element of tragedy.
[2454.84 → 2456.26] The wilderness exposes
[2456.26 → 2457.84] those parts of ourselves
[2457.84 → 2459.14] that deliberately
[2459.14 → 2461.36] choose disobedience.
[2461.88 → 2462.76] That deliberately
[2462.76 → 2464.74] grumble against God.
[2464.74 → 2466.82] That choose a different path
[2466.82 → 2468.68] than the ways of God.
[2470.56 → 2472.14] So Luke tells us
[2472.14 → 2473.00] that the word of God
[2473.00 → 2475.04] bypassed all those powerful
[2475.04 → 2476.28] political rulers
[2476.28 → 2477.76] that bypassed the palaces.
[2478.62 → 2480.74] They came to John,
[2481.80 → 2482.70] the son of a
[2482.70 → 2484.24] kind of everyday priest
[2484.24 → 2485.80] Christ in the wilderness.
[2487.00 → 2489.14] It's this dangerous place
[2489.14 → 2491.58] that exposes the deeper wilderness
[2491.58 → 2493.56] of the human soul,
[2493.98 → 2495.00] of the human heart.
[2495.54 → 2497.82] The barren parts of our hearts
[2497.82 → 2499.52] that rebel against God.
[2500.90 → 2502.36] But even though the wilderness
[2502.36 → 2504.04] was a place of disobedience
[2504.04 → 2505.04] for the people of God
[2505.04 → 2506.22] in their history,
[2506.70 → 2508.40] it was also a place of repentance.
[2509.26 → 2510.68] It's a place of preparing
[2510.68 → 2513.24] to enter into a new beginning.
[2514.16 → 2515.26] See, the wilderness
[2515.26 → 2516.00] is not only
[2516.00 → 2517.38] that place of disobedience,
[2517.74 → 2518.54] but it was also
[2518.54 → 2519.42] the place
[2519.42 → 2520.62] of preparation.
[2520.86 → 2521.46] It's the place
[2521.46 → 2522.92] of turning back
[2522.92 → 2523.56] to God.
[2524.72 → 2525.30] So yes,
[2525.38 → 2525.54] you know,
[2525.62 → 2526.56] that first generation
[2526.56 → 2527.26] of the Israelites
[2527.26 → 2529.10] who left Egypt,
[2529.30 → 2530.44] they fell apart
[2530.44 → 2531.04] in the wilderness.
[2531.58 → 2532.56] They never reached
[2532.56 → 2533.46] the promised land.
[2533.98 → 2535.02] But that's not
[2535.02 → 2536.36] where the story ends.
[2536.98 → 2538.38] The next generation
[2538.38 → 2540.02] grew up in the wilderness,
[2541.02 → 2543.34] they learned obedience.
[2543.56 → 2544.14] They learned
[2544.14 → 2545.92] to prepare their hearts
[2545.92 → 2547.40] and God brought them
[2547.40 → 2548.42] into the promised land.
[2549.66 → 2550.86] But before they ever
[2550.86 → 2551.88] entered the promised land,
[2551.94 → 2552.46] if you remember
[2552.46 → 2553.52] the history of Israel,
[2553.98 → 2555.10] what do they have to do?
[2555.26 → 2556.08] They're in the wilderness.
[2556.72 → 2557.32] Before they go
[2557.32 → 2558.12] into the promised land,
[2558.20 → 2558.90] what do they do?
[2559.82 → 2561.58] They first have to cross
[2561.58 → 2562.86] the Jordan River.
[2563.88 → 2565.28] They have to leave behind
[2565.28 → 2567.18] the old disobedience
[2567.18 → 2568.74] and they have to enter
[2568.74 → 2569.86] into a new story
[2569.86 → 2570.90] of what God is doing,
[2571.16 → 2572.38] of life with God
[2572.38 → 2573.32] as they cross
[2573.32 → 2574.18] the River Jordan
[2574.18 → 2575.30] into the promised land.
[2575.80 → 2576.74] And that is why,
[2576.86 → 2577.04] friends,
[2577.12 → 2578.28] that John's ministry,
[2578.56 → 2580.06] it takes place
[2580.06 → 2581.60] not in the promised land
[2581.60 → 2582.02] already,
[2582.70 → 2583.62] but in the wilderness,
[2584.40 → 2585.64] the place of preparation
[2585.64 → 2587.60] east of the Jordan River,
[2587.74 → 2588.42] east of Eden.
[2589.72 → 2590.28] And so out
[2590.28 → 2591.04] in that wilderness,
[2592.00 → 2593.14] this is the place
[2593.14 → 2594.60] of new beginnings
[2594.60 → 2597.00] that John is calling
[2597.00 → 2597.90] the people into.
[2598.74 → 2599.26] He's saying
[2599.26 → 2600.54] the place of preparation
[2600.54 → 2602.04] is the wilderness.
[2603.04 → 2603.92] And that's where
[2603.92 → 2605.36] Jesus wants to meet you.
[2606.42 → 2608.02] And Jesus was going to come
[2608.02 → 2609.30] and he was going to lead
[2609.30 → 2611.06] his people once again
[2611.06 → 2612.54] out of the wilderness
[2612.54 → 2615.10] and into the promised land,
[2615.16 → 2616.70] into a relationship with him.
[2617.50 → 2617.92] See, friends,
[2618.02 → 2619.46] Jesus wants to come
[2619.46 → 2620.84] as your king.
[2621.58 → 2622.90] Right into the parts
[2622.90 → 2623.60] of your life
[2623.60 → 2625.54] that dwell in the wilderness.
[2626.36 → 2627.38] Right into those parts
[2627.38 → 2627.98] of your life
[2627.98 → 2629.58] that are more characterized
[2629.58 → 2630.90] by, you know,
[2631.36 → 2632.62] pain and loss
[2632.62 → 2633.46] and wounds
[2633.46 → 2635.16] and those places
[2635.16 → 2636.58] of sin and addiction,
[2636.78 → 2638.04] those places of shame
[2638.04 → 2638.92] and loneliness.
[2640.08 → 2640.90] That's where
[2640.90 → 2642.24] Jesus as king
[2642.24 → 2643.70] wants to meet you.
[2644.22 → 2644.52] And friends,
[2644.58 → 2645.58] that is good news.
[2646.26 → 2646.84] It means that
[2646.84 → 2648.04] we don't have to succeed
[2648.04 → 2648.84] our way
[2648.84 → 2650.04] into the palace
[2650.04 → 2651.60] for God
[2651.60 → 2652.36] to be willing
[2652.36 → 2653.34] to come near to us.
[2653.94 → 2654.34] Right?
[2654.38 → 2654.98] Because he looks
[2654.98 → 2656.04] at all those palaces,
[2656.30 → 2657.50] all those summer villas,
[2657.60 → 2658.38] and he says,
[2658.58 → 2659.90] I don't want to go there.
[2661.14 → 2662.60] He wants to come
[2662.60 → 2664.02] to the people
[2664.02 → 2664.66] on the margins.
[2665.74 → 2666.68] He wants to come
[2666.68 → 2667.54] to those places
[2667.54 → 2668.96] and those people
[2668.96 → 2670.28] who are in the wilderness
[2670.28 → 2671.18] of knowing
[2671.18 → 2672.12] their need
[2672.12 → 2673.68] for God's grace
[2673.68 → 2674.78] and his love
[2674.78 → 2676.18] and who are willing
[2676.18 → 2676.60] and ready
[2676.60 → 2677.34] to meet him there.
[2677.34 → 2679.26] Okay, so that's
[2679.26 → 2679.86] the first point,
[2679.94 → 2680.64] the place
[2680.64 → 2681.76] of preparation.
[2682.60 → 2684.30] It's the wilderness
[2684.30 → 2685.48] of disobedience.
[2686.22 → 2686.96] But it's also
[2686.96 → 2687.94] that same place
[2687.94 → 2688.84] where God comes
[2688.84 → 2690.04] and he meets us there
[2690.04 → 2692.20] so that it becomes
[2692.20 → 2693.38] a place of new beginnings.
[2693.66 → 2694.78] It becomes a place
[2694.78 → 2696.50] where God comes to us
[2696.50 → 2698.00] and leads us
[2698.00 → 2698.88] into the life
[2698.88 → 2700.68] that he has for us.
[2701.66 → 2702.42] But second,
[2702.58 → 2703.64] John shows us
[2703.64 → 2705.52] not only that place
[2705.52 → 2706.66] but also the path.
[2706.66 → 2707.74] He shows us
[2707.74 → 2708.50] the way forward,
[2709.06 → 2710.18] this new opportunity,
[2710.44 → 2711.08] this new beginning.
[2712.18 → 2713.04] And again,
[2713.14 → 2713.84] this was kind of
[2713.84 → 2715.30] John's calling,
[2715.72 → 2715.92] right?
[2716.04 → 2717.20] To make ready
[2717.20 → 2718.66] a people prepared
[2718.66 → 2719.42] for the Lord.
[2720.02 → 2720.96] This gracious God
[2720.96 → 2721.46] is coming.
[2722.48 → 2723.44] How do we
[2723.44 → 2724.76] prepare for him?
[2726.52 → 2727.76] This is a photo
[2727.76 → 2730.26] of a gravel road
[2730.26 → 2732.26] in my home state
[2732.26 → 2733.30] of Vermont
[2733.30 → 2733.92] in the U.S.
[2733.92 → 2735.56] Vermont is known
[2735.56 → 2736.64] for only a few things.
[2736.70 → 2737.38] It's very small.
[2738.24 → 2739.08] Good roads
[2739.08 → 2740.42] is not one
[2740.42 → 2740.98] of those things.
[2742.28 → 2742.54] Now,
[2742.64 → 2743.54] these are the kinds
[2743.54 → 2744.74] of roads I remember
[2744.74 → 2745.72] as a teenager
[2745.72 → 2746.74] driving on
[2746.74 → 2747.36] all the time,
[2747.42 → 2748.30] whether it's the road
[2748.30 → 2749.56] leading up to my parents' house,
[2750.00 → 2750.86] whether it's the roads
[2750.86 → 2751.86] to my friends' houses,
[2752.12 → 2753.18] or over the hill
[2753.18 → 2753.90] to the school.
[2755.30 → 2756.26] And I'm sure
[2756.26 → 2756.98] I could have found
[2756.98 → 2758.18] pictures of roads
[2758.18 → 2758.66] of B.C.
[2758.94 → 2759.64] that look
[2759.64 → 2760.92] just like that.
[2762.06 → 2762.46] Now,
[2762.54 → 2762.88] you know,
[2763.02 → 2764.06] nobody wants
[2764.06 → 2764.94] to drive
[2764.94 → 2766.12] on that kind
[2766.12 → 2766.56] of a road.
[2767.42 → 2767.66] Right?
[2767.76 → 2768.74] If you kind of,
[2768.78 → 2769.66] if you had a choice,
[2769.70 → 2770.80] if you saw that road,
[2771.36 → 2772.36] but you could go around it,
[2772.40 → 2772.90] you would pick
[2772.90 → 2773.72] the other route.
[2774.22 → 2775.18] And you'd kind of,
[2775.22 → 2775.38] like,
[2775.46 → 2776.02] cry out,
[2776.10 → 2776.20] like,
[2776.30 → 2776.66] ah,
[2776.72 → 2777.62] when is somebody
[2777.62 → 2778.32] going to fix
[2778.32 → 2779.00] the road?
[2781.00 → 2782.26] And when John the Baptist
[2782.26 → 2783.24] tells us
[2783.24 → 2783.86] how
[2783.86 → 2785.14] to prepare
[2785.14 → 2786.28] for the coming king,
[2786.28 → 2788.10] he uses this,
[2788.20 → 2789.10] he uses this,
[2789.48 → 2790.04] sorry,
[2790.16 → 2791.76] he uses this imagery
[2791.76 → 2793.48] of road repair.
[2794.16 → 2795.14] So let's look
[2795.14 → 2796.18] at Isaiah,
[2797.66 → 2798.26] sorry,
[2798.86 → 2799.12] it's at,
[2799.20 → 2799.32] well,
[2799.42 → 2800.10] it's quoting Isaiah,
[2800.24 → 2800.86] but Luke,
[2801.20 → 2802.50] verses 4 and 5,
[2802.58 → 2803.16] Luke chapter 3,
[2803.24 → 2803.84] 4 and 5,
[2804.26 → 2805.36] where he writes,
[2805.44 → 2806.06] quoting Isaiah,
[2806.38 → 2807.22] as it is written
[2807.22 → 2807.82] in the book
[2807.82 → 2808.36] of the words
[2808.36 → 2809.32] of Isaiah the prophet,
[2809.94 → 2810.70] a voice
[2810.70 → 2811.92] of unfalling
[2811.92 → 2812.60] in the wilderness,
[2812.80 → 2813.46] that's John,
[2814.40 → 2815.46] prepare the way
[2815.46 → 2816.08] for the Lord.
[2816.28 → 2817.44] Make straight paths
[2817.44 → 2817.92] for him.
[2818.68 → 2819.52] Every valley
[2819.52 → 2820.50] shall be filled in,
[2820.84 → 2821.64] every mountain
[2821.64 → 2822.14] and hill
[2822.14 → 2822.80] made low,
[2823.12 → 2824.38] the crooked roads
[2824.38 → 2825.38] shall become straight,
[2825.68 → 2826.94] the rough ways
[2826.94 → 2828.18] smooth.
[2830.58 → 2831.14] See,
[2831.24 → 2832.02] back then,
[2832.16 → 2833.10] in the time of Israel,
[2833.24 → 2834.16] you didn't have
[2834.16 → 2834.94] asphalt,
[2835.34 → 2835.50] right?
[2835.50 → 2836.02] You didn't have
[2836.02 → 2836.94] paved roads,
[2837.44 → 2838.14] and in fact,
[2838.22 → 2839.18] what a road was,
[2839.24 → 2839.58] typically,
[2839.80 → 2840.94] was just where
[2840.94 → 2842.50] animals kept walking,
[2842.98 → 2843.50] and then eventually
[2843.50 → 2844.44] people kept walking,
[2844.68 → 2845.58] and they would kind of
[2845.58 → 2846.88] carve these tracks
[2846.88 → 2847.68] into the ground.
[2848.74 → 2849.48] Especially out
[2849.48 → 2850.06] in the wilderness,
[2850.34 → 2851.88] nobody built roads,
[2852.42 → 2853.88] unless you were the king.
[2854.82 → 2855.92] When the king
[2855.92 → 2857.32] wanted to go on a journey,
[2857.46 → 2858.46] if he wanted to go
[2858.46 → 2859.40] visit one of these
[2859.40 → 2860.86] towns and cities
[2860.86 → 2861.60] out in the wilderness,
[2861.92 → 2862.74] he would send
[2862.74 → 2863.74] his heralds,
[2864.04 → 2864.88] his engineers,
[2865.24 → 2865.96] ahead of him,
[2866.48 → 2867.34] and they would come,
[2867.42 → 2867.96] and they would say,
[2868.10 → 2868.28] hey,
[2868.42 → 2869.96] your king is coming.
[2870.86 → 2872.82] Prepare the king's highway.
[2872.82 → 2875.26] If the king was coming
[2875.26 → 2875.76] for a visit,
[2875.88 → 2877.28] you had to get ready.
[2877.46 → 2878.56] You had to prepare things.
[2879.28 → 2880.90] And what you need to do
[2880.90 → 2882.88] is you need to fix the roads
[2882.88 → 2884.36] so the king
[2884.36 → 2885.84] can actually get there
[2885.84 → 2886.34] safely.
[2887.34 → 2887.82] Right?
[2887.90 → 2888.16] And now,
[2888.32 → 2888.96] if you,
[2889.18 → 2889.96] us peons,
[2890.10 → 2890.24] right,
[2890.30 → 2892.26] if you come to a gully
[2892.26 → 2893.04] in the road,
[2893.76 → 2894.76] you just had to take
[2894.76 → 2896.02] your cart down the gully
[2896.02 → 2898.00] and up the other side.
[2899.00 → 2899.44] Or,
[2899.56 → 2900.66] if you come to a boulder
[2900.66 → 2901.80] in the road,
[2902.40 → 2903.66] you can't move the boulder.
[2904.40 → 2905.20] You would just have to
[2905.20 → 2906.76] find a way around.
[2907.66 → 2908.74] But when the king
[2908.74 → 2910.02] comes to you,
[2910.68 → 2911.70] you have to prepare
[2911.70 → 2912.40] a smooth road.
[2912.48 → 2913.22] The king's not going to
[2913.22 → 2914.80] climb over boulders.
[2915.06 → 2916.54] The king is not going to,
[2916.68 → 2916.98] you know,
[2917.06 → 2918.82] go down into gullies.
[2920.82 → 2922.58] But in this case,
[2923.16 → 2924.52] who is coming?
[2925.52 → 2926.54] Because we're not just
[2926.54 → 2927.30] talking about
[2927.30 → 2928.76] boulders being
[2928.76 → 2929.74] kind of moved
[2929.74 → 2930.46] off the path.
[2930.56 → 2931.20] We're talking about
[2931.20 → 2932.68] mountains being
[2932.68 → 2933.46] taken down.
[2934.36 → 2934.88] Right?
[2934.90 → 2935.56] And we're not talking
[2935.56 → 2937.10] just about little gullies
[2937.10 → 2937.82] that need to be
[2937.82 → 2939.04] maybe smoothed over.
[2939.38 → 2940.34] We're talking about
[2940.34 → 2941.10] valleys
[2941.10 → 2942.22] that need to be
[2942.22 → 2942.72] filled in.
[2944.30 → 2944.50] And so,
[2944.62 → 2945.62] who is John the Baptist
[2945.62 → 2946.90] talking about?
[2947.06 → 2948.04] He's talking about
[2948.04 → 2949.20] the true king.
[2949.42 → 2951.06] The king of kings.
[2952.22 → 2952.92] And John says,
[2952.92 → 2953.84] the way you prepare
[2953.84 → 2954.88] for this king
[2954.88 → 2956.82] is not for our
[2956.82 → 2958.52] literal roads.
[2959.24 → 2960.88] It's but with repentance.
[2962.18 → 2963.62] Look at verse 3 with me.
[2965.80 → 2966.40] He went,
[2966.54 → 2966.82] John,
[2966.94 → 2967.78] he went into
[2967.78 → 2969.04] all the country
[2969.04 → 2969.78] around the Jordan
[2969.78 → 2971.14] preaching a baptism
[2971.14 → 2972.38] of repentance
[2972.38 → 2973.96] for the forgiveness
[2973.96 → 2974.72] of sins.
[2975.28 → 2975.42] See,
[2975.50 → 2976.16] to receive
[2976.16 → 2977.80] Jesus as king,
[2977.86 → 2978.26] you don't need
[2978.26 → 2979.30] to mend your roads.
[2979.40 → 2980.40] You need to mend
[2980.40 → 2981.40] your heart.
[2982.22 → 2982.88] You need to mend
[2982.88 → 2983.58] your lives.
[2984.26 → 2985.00] You have to prepare
[2985.00 → 2986.30] the way of your heart
[2986.30 → 2987.36] so that Christ
[2987.36 → 2988.22] can come
[2988.22 → 2989.10] and he has
[2989.10 → 2989.94] full access.
[2991.66 → 2992.40] And what John is,
[2992.42 → 2993.74] he's painting this picture
[2993.74 → 2995.86] with this road repair
[2995.86 → 2996.34] metaphor
[2996.34 → 2998.22] of what a renewed
[2998.22 → 2999.24] life looks like.
[2999.80 → 3001.06] A life that's consistent
[3001.06 → 3002.14] with the kingdom of God.
[3002.36 → 3003.06] A life that actually
[3003.06 → 3003.94] prepares the way
[3003.94 → 3004.54] for the Messiah.
[3004.54 → 3004.62] Messiah.
[3005.80 → 3006.12] And it's,
[3006.22 → 3006.84] what it is,
[3007.12 → 3008.44] it's to make a separation
[3008.44 → 3009.92] from that past
[3009.92 → 3010.96] of disobedience
[3010.96 → 3012.58] and to embrace
[3012.58 → 3013.98] the ways of the king.
[3014.48 → 3015.20] To prepare
[3015.20 → 3016.56] to become part
[3016.56 → 3017.18] of his kingdom.
[3017.84 → 3018.44] And so it means
[3018.44 → 3019.08] to turn away
[3019.08 → 3019.98] from the path
[3019.98 → 3021.02] that you have been
[3021.02 → 3021.86] walking down
[3021.86 → 3023.50] to admit that you are
[3023.50 → 3024.94] choosing the wrong way
[3024.94 → 3027.14] and it's to turn around
[3027.14 → 3028.56] toward the Lord
[3028.56 → 3029.96] in his ways.
[3031.18 → 3031.98] And you know what?
[3031.98 → 3032.82] It's so important
[3032.82 → 3033.72] for us to notice
[3033.72 → 3035.14] that what,
[3035.14 → 3036.82] what John doesn't say.
[3037.48 → 3038.54] He doesn't say,
[3038.68 → 3039.08] well, okay,
[3039.14 → 3039.60] here's the thing
[3039.60 → 3040.10] you got to do.
[3040.16 → 3041.02] The king is coming.
[3042.70 → 3043.96] Beautify your city.
[3044.66 → 3044.84] You know,
[3044.90 → 3046.02] your town is a little
[3046.02 → 3047.26] ramshackle.
[3047.36 → 3047.76] You need a
[3047.80 → 3048.54] you need to kind of
[3048.54 → 3049.60] stiff it up,
[3049.82 → 3050.06] right?
[3050.12 → 3050.96] Build some really
[3050.96 → 3052.06] magnificent temples
[3052.06 → 3052.70] and palaces
[3052.70 → 3054.62] that will impress the king.
[3055.52 → 3056.92] No, he doesn't say that.
[3057.20 → 3057.88] He says,
[3058.04 → 3059.76] just allow the king
[3059.76 → 3060.94] to draw near to you.
[3061.98 → 3063.16] Your king already
[3063.16 → 3064.02] loves you.
[3064.12 → 3065.92] He wants to come to you.
[3067.06 → 3069.02] He desires to be with you
[3069.02 → 3070.08] and he is coming
[3070.08 → 3071.38] with grace and blessing.
[3072.06 → 3074.44] Just allow him to come.
[3076.80 → 3077.56] But, you know,
[3077.62 → 3078.38] how do we know
[3078.38 → 3079.94] that's the heart
[3079.94 → 3080.44] of the king?
[3080.52 → 3080.96] How do we know
[3080.96 → 3081.92] that's what he wants
[3081.92 → 3083.06] to do when he comes
[3083.06 → 3083.60] to us?
[3085.14 → 3085.36] Right?
[3085.44 → 3085.70] How do,
[3085.76 → 3086.30] how do we know
[3086.30 → 3087.40] that he doesn't see
[3087.40 → 3088.16] that wilderness
[3088.16 → 3089.44] of disobedience
[3089.44 → 3090.68] of our hearts
[3090.68 → 3092.76] and perhaps,
[3093.10 → 3094.70] as we might fear,
[3094.86 → 3096.58] respond with disappointment
[3096.58 → 3098.72] or kind of that
[3098.72 → 3099.92] deep sigh,
[3100.06 → 3100.18] like,
[3100.26 → 3100.48] ugh,
[3100.82 → 3103.12] or with anger
[3103.12 → 3105.10] or with contempt?
[3105.10 → 3107.30] I mean,
[3107.32 → 3107.90] if we know
[3107.90 → 3109.14] our own hearts,
[3110.10 → 3110.94] we know that
[3110.94 → 3112.50] they're not quite
[3112.50 → 3113.64] worthy of the king.
[3114.00 → 3114.90] They're not quite
[3114.90 → 3115.44] honouring
[3115.44 → 3117.00] to the king.
[3118.12 → 3119.00] But the Bible
[3119.00 → 3119.86] says that when
[3119.86 → 3121.00] God comes,
[3122.06 → 3122.96] he does come
[3122.96 → 3123.56] with grace.
[3124.52 → 3125.60] He comes with grace.
[3125.70 → 3126.28] He knows
[3126.28 → 3127.28] the wilderness
[3127.28 → 3128.84] that we live in
[3128.84 → 3129.88] and he comes
[3129.88 → 3130.60] anyway.
[3130.60 → 3132.08] You know,
[3132.16 → 3132.92] a very important
[3132.92 → 3133.84] principle of
[3133.84 → 3134.76] biblical interpretation
[3134.76 → 3135.58] is this.
[3135.84 → 3136.96] If a New Testament
[3136.96 → 3137.82] passage quotes
[3137.82 → 3138.44] an Old Testament
[3138.44 → 3139.08] passage,
[3139.80 → 3140.56] like John here
[3140.56 → 3140.96] is quoting
[3140.96 → 3141.48] from Isaiah
[3141.48 → 3142.18] chapter 40,
[3142.98 → 3143.54] that you don't
[3143.54 → 3144.32] just take those
[3144.32 → 3145.16] verses only,
[3145.50 → 3146.60] you actually take
[3146.60 → 3147.82] the whole section
[3147.82 → 3148.50] that it's drawn
[3148.50 → 3148.76] from.
[3149.80 → 3150.38] You look at
[3150.38 → 3151.60] the larger context
[3151.60 → 3153.18] to understand it.
[3153.90 → 3154.30] And so,
[3154.44 → 3155.08] this comes
[3155.08 → 3155.74] from Isaiah
[3155.74 → 3156.48] chapter 40,
[3156.88 → 3157.90] and in the book
[3157.90 → 3158.46] of Isaiah,
[3158.46 → 3160.56] there are 39
[3160.56 → 3162.56] chapters that
[3162.56 → 3163.02] are mostly
[3163.02 → 3163.72] pretty horrible.
[3164.48 → 3165.48] And they talk
[3165.48 → 3166.28] about sin,
[3166.90 → 3167.44] and they talk
[3167.44 → 3168.50] about injustice,
[3169.16 → 3170.42] and idolatry,
[3170.90 → 3171.86] and the judgment
[3171.86 → 3172.60] on the people
[3172.60 → 3173.02] of God,
[3173.08 → 3173.62] and the judgment
[3173.62 → 3174.50] on all of these
[3174.50 → 3174.94] nations.
[3175.14 → 3176.10] Every conceivable
[3176.10 → 3177.76] reason why God
[3177.76 → 3178.58] would rightly
[3178.58 → 3179.38] be angry,
[3180.24 → 3181.16] and sigh
[3181.16 → 3182.00] in disappointment,
[3183.00 → 3184.30] is addressed
[3184.30 → 3185.08] in those first
[3185.08 → 3186.18] 39 chapters
[3186.18 → 3186.74] of Isaiah.
[3186.74 → 3186.86] Isaiah.
[3187.76 → 3188.56] But then,
[3188.96 → 3190.04] chapter 40
[3190.04 → 3191.76] opens in this
[3191.76 → 3192.06] way.
[3192.60 → 3193.20] These are the
[3193.20 → 3193.94] first two verses
[3193.94 → 3195.18] right before
[3195.18 → 3196.48] John's sermon
[3196.48 → 3197.14] text that he
[3197.14 → 3197.50] uses,
[3197.96 → 3198.46] and the ones
[3198.46 → 3198.96] that we read
[3198.96 → 3199.94] earlier in the
[3199.94 → 3200.32] service.
[3200.68 → 3201.16] This is what it
[3201.16 → 3201.40] says.
[3201.74 → 3202.28] Comfort,
[3202.84 → 3203.52] comfort,
[3204.52 → 3205.28] my people,
[3206.00 → 3206.82] says your God.
[3209.08 → 3210.82] Speak tenderly
[3210.82 → 3211.66] to Jerusalem.
[3212.60 → 3213.52] Proclaim to her
[3213.52 → 3215.10] that her hard
[3215.10 → 3216.26] service or her
[3216.26 → 3218.22] warfare has
[3218.22 → 3218.96] been completed,
[3219.52 → 3220.60] that her sin
[3220.60 → 3222.30] has been paid
[3222.30 → 3222.64] for,
[3223.10 → 3223.74] that she has
[3223.74 → 3224.60] received from
[3224.60 → 3225.44] the Lord's hand
[3225.44 → 3227.00] double for all
[3227.00 → 3227.48] of her sins.
[3227.54 → 3228.30] It means that it
[3228.30 → 3228.92] is a full
[3228.92 → 3229.62] pardon.
[3233.12 → 3234.62] The Lord has
[3234.62 → 3235.86] every reason to
[3235.86 → 3236.92] come in judgment,
[3237.72 → 3238.90] but in his love
[3238.90 → 3239.36] and mercy,
[3239.48 → 3240.32] he sends Jesus,
[3240.48 → 3240.98] the Messiah,
[3241.12 → 3242.02] the anointed king,
[3242.02 → 3242.90] and Jesus
[3242.90 → 3243.72] comes how?
[3244.46 → 3245.12] He comes in
[3245.12 → 3245.74] tenderness.
[3246.96 → 3248.28] Speak tenderly
[3248.28 → 3248.92] to Jerusalem.
[3250.06 → 3250.90] He comes in
[3250.90 → 3251.36] pardon.
[3251.78 → 3252.88] He comes in
[3252.88 → 3253.44] grace and
[3253.44 → 3253.80] forgiveness.
[3254.38 → 3254.96] And it's not
[3254.96 → 3255.84] just this partial
[3255.84 → 3256.24] pardon.
[3256.34 → 3256.82] It's not like,
[3257.16 → 3258.18] yeah, I kind of
[3258.18 → 3258.66] forgive you.
[3258.72 → 3259.14] This is what we
[3259.14 → 3259.28] do.
[3259.34 → 3259.76] I kind of
[3259.76 → 3260.28] forgive you,
[3260.60 → 3261.58] but I still
[3261.58 → 3262.04] want to keep
[3262.04 → 3262.40] you at a
[3262.40 → 3262.86] distance.
[3264.72 → 3265.40] That's not what
[3265.40 → 3266.00] God does for
[3266.00 → 3266.10] us.
[3266.14 → 3266.52] It's not this
[3266.52 → 3267.22] begrudging,
[3267.60 → 3268.54] okay, fine.
[3269.56 → 3270.78] He pardons us
[3270.78 → 3271.72] fully.
[3272.46 → 3273.24] Not wanting to
[3273.24 → 3273.80] keep us at a
[3273.80 → 3274.26] distance, but
[3274.26 → 3275.02] wanting to draw
[3275.02 → 3275.76] near to us.
[3277.06 → 3277.64] And Jesus
[3277.64 → 3278.38] comes in
[3278.38 → 3278.94] peace.
[3279.38 → 3279.84] He comes in
[3279.84 → 3280.30] forgiveness,
[3280.54 → 3281.34] not because we
[3281.34 → 3282.00] are sinless,
[3282.22 → 3282.82] not because we
[3282.82 → 3283.32] are good or
[3283.32 → 3284.14] worthy, but
[3284.14 → 3285.58] because he is
[3285.58 → 3286.34] the God of
[3286.34 → 3286.72] grace.
[3288.08 → 3288.86] And that is
[3288.86 → 3289.62] what motivated
[3289.62 → 3291.16] John to
[3291.16 → 3292.08] then preach the
[3292.08 → 3292.78] way he did,
[3292.86 → 3293.50] to tell the
[3293.50 → 3294.40] people of God,
[3294.80 → 3295.74] your Saviour is
[3295.74 → 3297.62] coming, and
[3297.62 → 3298.24] he's coming in
[3298.24 → 3298.52] grace.
[3298.62 → 3299.38] He's coming in
[3299.38 → 3299.78] forgiveness.
[3300.78 → 3301.42] And the
[3301.42 → 3302.04] call of
[3302.04 → 3302.36] John the
[3302.36 → 3302.88] Baptist, the
[3302.88 → 3303.90] voice calling
[3303.90 → 3304.20] in the
[3304.20 → 3305.74] wilderness to
[3305.74 → 3306.44] the people of
[3306.44 → 3307.02] Israel and
[3307.02 → 3307.88] to us today,
[3308.64 → 3309.66] is to make
[3309.66 → 3311.12] yourself reachable
[3311.12 → 3311.86] to the king.
[3312.72 → 3313.78] Do the road
[3313.78 → 3314.96] work of
[3314.96 → 3315.44] repentance.
[3317.08 → 3318.16] Just prepare
[3318.16 → 3318.88] your heart to
[3318.88 → 3319.56] receive him,
[3319.76 → 3320.68] because repentance
[3320.68 → 3322.16] is about preparing
[3322.16 → 3324.12] the highway for
[3324.12 → 3325.36] our God to
[3325.36 → 3326.20] come to us.
[3326.40 → 3327.06] We don't have to
[3327.06 → 3327.56] make a long
[3327.56 → 3330.76] journey, but we
[3330.76 → 3332.16] can prepare that
[3332.16 → 3333.24] way for our
[3333.24 → 3334.28] Saviour to come
[3334.28 → 3335.28] to us, to
[3335.28 → 3336.18] connect us to
[3336.18 → 3337.68] our home in
[3337.68 → 3338.36] Jesus Christ.
[3339.56 → 3340.30] And though there
[3340.30 → 3341.66] is a call to
[3341.66 → 3342.72] repentance, something
[3342.72 → 3345.08] for us to do, it
[3345.08 → 3345.88] is only made
[3345.88 → 3347.64] possible in that
[3347.64 → 3349.10] Jesus Christ is
[3349.10 → 3350.10] the highway.
[3351.40 → 3352.92] Jesus Christ is
[3352.92 → 3353.44] the highway.
[3353.44 → 3355.70] In the gospel of
[3355.70 → 3357.86] John, Jesus tells
[3357.86 → 3358.34] one of his
[3358.34 → 3359.58] disciples, Nathanael,
[3359.78 → 3360.06] this.
[3360.16 → 3361.58] He says, right in
[3361.58 → 3362.34] John chapter 1,
[3362.90 → 3365.90] very truly, I
[3365.90 → 3367.52] tell you, you
[3367.52 → 3368.48] will see heaven
[3368.48 → 3369.74] open and the
[3369.74 → 3370.76] angels of God
[3370.76 → 3371.82] ascending and
[3371.82 → 3373.52] descending on the
[3373.52 → 3374.18] Son of Man.
[3375.18 → 3375.94] Where does that
[3375.94 → 3376.44] come from?
[3376.60 → 3376.94] Do you know?
[3378.94 → 3379.88] Jacob, remember?
[3380.12 → 3380.96] Back in Genesis,
[3381.90 → 3383.72] Jacob had a dream
[3383.72 → 3384.70] of a ladder.
[3384.70 → 3386.54] And it was a
[3386.54 → 3387.32] dream of the
[3387.32 → 3388.28] ladder reaching up
[3388.28 → 3389.22] into heaven and
[3389.22 → 3389.96] the angels of
[3389.96 → 3391.38] heaven ascending and
[3391.38 → 3392.42] descending on that
[3392.42 → 3392.78] ladder.
[3393.18 → 3393.90] And Jesus is
[3393.90 → 3395.48] saying, I am the
[3395.48 → 3395.78] ladder.
[3397.62 → 3398.52] Jesus came to
[3398.52 → 3399.38] provide the true
[3399.38 → 3400.74] and better way of
[3400.74 → 3402.32] access to God.
[3402.88 → 3403.98] He built that
[3403.98 → 3405.04] highway from
[3405.04 → 3405.90] heaven to earth
[3405.90 → 3407.66] to come so that
[3407.66 → 3408.38] heaven and earth
[3408.38 → 3409.36] can come together
[3409.36 → 3410.08] in himself.
[3410.80 → 3412.10] A way for God to
[3412.10 → 3412.86] come to us.
[3412.86 → 3414.36] And it's a highway
[3414.36 → 3415.64] that is built with
[3415.64 → 3417.32] the hard work and
[3417.32 → 3418.24] the lumber and
[3418.24 → 3419.14] the sweat and the
[3419.14 → 3420.80] blood of the
[3420.80 → 3421.16] cross.
[3422.46 → 3423.66] And it's a highway
[3423.66 → 3424.40] that can come
[3424.40 → 3426.06] directly into
[3426.06 → 3428.24] every heart and
[3428.24 → 3429.46] every life.
[3431.56 → 3432.50] In the final
[3432.50 → 3433.12] verse of our
[3433.12 → 3434.36] passage, verse 6,
[3434.42 → 3435.06] it says this,
[3435.74 → 3436.62] and all people
[3436.62 → 3437.54] will see God's
[3437.54 → 3437.90] salvation.
[3437.90 → 3438.02] salvation.
[3439.86 → 3440.94] John is preparing
[3440.94 → 3442.24] all people to see
[3442.24 → 3443.34] the salvation of
[3443.34 → 3443.62] God.
[3444.20 → 3445.22] The highway Jesus
[3445.22 → 3446.66] has built is
[3446.66 → 3448.30] open, and it's
[3448.30 → 3450.18] available to all
[3450.18 → 3450.92] right now.
[3451.46 → 3452.22] A highway to the
[3452.22 → 3453.28] living God is open.
[3453.50 → 3454.74] The way has been
[3454.74 → 3455.72] made smooth because
[3455.72 → 3457.70] of Jesus Christ and
[3457.70 → 3458.52] he is preparing
[3458.52 → 3460.50] people to see
[3460.50 → 3461.24] God's salvation.
[3461.96 → 3462.80] And when they see
[3462.80 → 3463.52] Jesus, they will
[3463.52 → 3464.68] ultimately see that
[3464.68 → 3467.66] the ground is
[3467.66 → 3469.20] level at the
[3469.20 → 3469.50] foot of the
[3469.50 → 3469.84] cross.
[3470.84 → 3471.98] The ground is
[3471.98 → 3472.82] level at the
[3472.82 → 3473.12] foot of the
[3473.12 → 3473.44] cross.
[3473.52 → 3473.88] What does that
[3473.88 → 3474.12] mean?
[3474.52 → 3475.08] It means that it
[3475.08 → 3476.28] doesn't matter if
[3476.28 → 3477.52] someone is high
[3477.52 → 3478.90] and exalted, rich
[3478.90 → 3479.44] and powerful,
[3479.64 → 3480.90] influential, like a
[3480.90 → 3482.48] king or a
[3482.48 → 3482.78] governor.
[3483.58 → 3484.62] It doesn't matter
[3484.62 → 3485.44] whether someone is
[3485.44 → 3487.10] low and humble
[3487.10 → 3489.20] or weak or poor
[3489.20 → 3490.08] or needy.
[3490.08 → 3491.76] It doesn't matter
[3491.76 → 3492.82] what you bring,
[3493.50 → 3494.58] whether it's a good
[3494.58 → 3495.70] moral track record
[3495.70 → 3497.82] or a history of
[3497.82 → 3499.06] atrocious failures.
[3499.98 → 3502.26] You cannot climb so
[3502.26 → 3503.16] high as to get
[3503.16 → 3504.94] closer to God and
[3504.94 → 3505.88] you cannot fall so
[3505.88 → 3507.64] low as to be beyond
[3507.64 → 3508.62] his grace.
[3509.66 → 3510.86] God meets every
[3510.86 → 3513.02] single person in
[3513.02 → 3514.92] the wilderness and
[3514.92 → 3515.92] he offers us grace
[3515.92 → 3516.72] and he offers us
[3516.72 → 3517.46] forgiveness and he
[3517.46 → 3518.36] meets us where we
[3518.36 → 3520.16] are, and we're
[3520.16 → 3521.14] simply invited to
[3521.14 → 3522.14] prepare him room.
[3523.78 → 3525.00] To be willing to
[3525.00 → 3526.34] open our hearts to
[3526.34 → 3527.84] turn from the path
[3527.84 → 3528.92] that we were going
[3528.92 → 3529.86] away from God in
[3529.86 → 3531.74] disobedience and to
[3531.74 → 3533.08] turn to God and to
[3533.08 → 3533.96] believe the good
[3533.96 → 3535.56] news that our king
[3535.56 → 3537.10] loves us and that he
[3537.10 → 3537.96] is coming to us.
[3539.30 → 3540.18] So friends, let's
[3540.18 → 3541.06] pray that God would
[3541.06 → 3541.76] help us, that he
[3541.76 → 3542.78] would help us to
[3542.78 → 3544.92] prepare the way for
[3544.92 → 3545.28] the Lord.
[3545.28 → 3548.20] O Lord, you are
[3548.20 → 3551.02] the true king and
[3551.02 → 3551.94] you have made a
[3551.94 → 3553.06] way to come to us
[3553.06 → 3554.20] in the howling
[3554.20 → 3555.18] wilderness of our
[3555.18 → 3555.84] own lives and
[3555.84 → 3556.20] hearts.
[3556.46 → 3557.36] You desire to
[3557.36 → 3557.74] come.
[3558.92 → 3559.76] You desire to
[3559.76 → 3560.58] abide with us.
[3561.78 → 3562.64] So living God,
[3562.70 → 3563.48] would you open up
[3563.48 → 3564.16] the highway of
[3564.16 → 3565.46] grace into our
[3565.46 → 3567.14] lives and deliver
[3567.14 → 3568.72] your peace and
[3568.72 → 3570.56] deliver the joy and
[3570.56 → 3571.82] the courage that we
[3571.82 → 3573.68] need so that we
[3573.68 → 3575.04] would be willing and
[3575.04 → 3576.28] ready to receive
[3576.28 → 3578.16] you and to follow
[3578.16 → 3578.44] you.
[3578.92 → 3579.76] We pray in Jesus'
[3579.94 → 3580.12] name.
[3580.50 → 3580.74] Amen.
[3583.96 → 3584.44] Okay.
[3586.28 → 3587.92] So as the singers
[3587.92 → 3588.60] come forward and
[3588.60 → 3589.56] get the stands ready,
[3589.80 → 3590.90] you can prepare also
[3590.90 → 3593.56] to stand and we
[3593.56 → 3594.36] will sing a song of
[3594.36 → 3594.78] response.
[3594.78 → 3594.88] Thank you.

[3717.50 → 3722.04] Only teach us every day,

[3726.56 → 3731.36] And when we hold all things on past,

[3761.06 → 3765.76] Through its love, which goes right down,
[3766.30 → 3770.36] There forever may we sing,
[3770.36 → 3775.90] Hallelujah, to our King.
[3775.90 → 3778.84] May we sing,
[3778.84 → 3779.00] May we sing,
[3779.00 → 3795.46] We have the opportunity now to bring our offerings to God,
[3795.54 → 3796.58] Our financial contributions,
[3796.58 → 3799.52] And our, any sums received today,
[3799.52 → 3801.08] Will go to World Renew.
[3801.08 → 3803.82] It's an organization that works around the world,
[3803.82 → 3806.46] To alleviate poverty and illness,
[3806.46 → 3808.06] Not just through direct aid,
[3808.06 → 3810.36] But also through equipping people,
[3810.36 → 3812.06] With the tools and skills,
[3812.06 → 3814.26] To help themselves as well.
[3814.26 → 3816.20] So I'll ask the deacons to come forward,
[3816.20 → 3817.60] And take our offerings at this time.
[3817.60 → 3829.14] Thank you.
[3829.18 → 3831.48] Lord,
[3831.48 → 3837.48] Amen.
[3837.48 → 3840.28] Amen.
[3842.40 → 3847.12] Amen.
[3847.60 → 3851.88] Hello.
[3854.82 → 3864.38] So maybe some of you have a favourite Christmas album that you like to listen to over the holidays.
[3865.10 → 3871.20] Well, for many years, our family just had one CD that someone had given us,
[3871.52 → 3874.78] and it's a group called Ordinary Time.
[3874.78 → 3879.98] And they're actually just a very small little group maybe most of you haven't heard of.
[3880.46 → 3884.40] I think many of the members actually studied at Regent College, so they would prepare there.
[3885.26 → 3889.34] So we had this CD. It's very kind of just acoustic guitar, very quiet.
[3890.54 → 3896.24] So we would just listen to this song, this whole album, over and over in the car wherever we went during Christmas.
[3896.80 → 3898.48] So these songs are very ingrained in us.
[3898.48 → 3906.64] And so Ellie and I will sing this song that we love called Zion from that album.
[3906.64 → 3930.64] Tonight, tonight.
[3930.64 → 3935.86] I hope you have a great song, that we should let the Senate appear right now.
[3935.86 → 3938.14] I hope you're com allegedly by lo Commentary by emotional fraud violent sisters.
[3938.14 → 3942.70] Maybe some of the things that I have done today or may have done before we should never let,
[3942.70 → 3944.30] where I can make sure that I have done avert in mind for this song.
[3944.36 → 3946.60] I'm sorting the Salmi that can be $1.230 points that I have done with you.
[3946.60 → 3950.10] Full of angels
[3950.10 → 3953.60] Hallelujah
[3953.60 → 3961.60] Hallelujah
[3961.60 → 3966.60] Hallelujah
[3966.60 → 3972.60] Hallelujah
[3972.60 → 3974.60] Oh
[3974.60 → 3976.60] Oh
[3976.60 → 3978.60] Oh
[3978.60 → 3990.60] Shepard voice would terrify
[3990.60 → 3994.60] The glory of the Lord
[3994.60 → 3998.60] Cut through an eye
[3998.60 → 4003.60] Wise men give us
[4003.60 → 4008.60] So I'll whisper
[4008.60 → 4013.60] To the newborn child
[4013.60 → 4018.60] Hallelujah
[4018.60 → 4024.60] Hallelujah
[4024.60 → 4030.60] Hallelujah
[4030.60 → 4034.60] Hallelujah
[4034.60 → 4036.60] Hallelujah
[4036.60 → 4038.60] Hallelujah
[4038.60 → 4046.60] Hallelujah
[4046.60 → 4048.60] Sing, oh sing
[4048.60 → 4052.60] With heavenly hope
[4052.60 → 4059.60] The wonder of our Saviour's birth
[4059.60 → 4065.60] He speaks to all of you
[4065.60 → 4067.60] Who may come
[4067.60 → 4069.60] On this
[4069.60 → 4074.60] The holiest sunbath
[4074.60 → 4076.60] Hallelujah
[4076.60 → 4080.60] Hallelujah
[4080.60 → 4086.60] Hallelujah
[4086.60 → 4092.60] Hallelujah
[4092.60 → 4096.60] Hallelujah
[4098.60 → 4101.60] 焥
[4101.60 → 4103.60] Hallelujah
[4103.60 → 4108.60] Hallelujah
[4108.60 → 4113.60] Hallelujah
[4113.60 → 4133.48] Thank you, Pastor Jason and Ellie, for sharing that with us.
[4133.60 → 4134.60] Amen.
[4142.60 → 4144.34] Let's come to God in prayer.
[4148.06 → 4154.06] In the hushed anticipation of your coming, O Lord, remind us that you are always with us,
[4154.54 → 4158.98] that we might always be eager to fulfill your will and be eager to pray.
[4158.98 → 4165.94] O God, in days to come, the mountain of your house will be established, and your joy shall reign.
[4166.84 → 4171.58] We pray for the Church, that you might teach us your ways and that we might walk in your paths.
[4172.16 → 4176.24] We pray this morning for effectiveness in our ministries, both near and far.
[4176.98 → 4179.84] We pray for those working locally in our Mandarin ministries,
[4179.84 → 4186.76] and pray for continued strength for Pastor Nancy and her team in their efforts to bring your message to the Chinese community.
[4187.56 → 4190.88] We pray for the efforts going into our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day services,
[4191.38 → 4194.66], and thank you for the talents and dedication of those leading those efforts.
[4195.80 → 4197.62] We pray for the work of World Renew.
[4198.18 → 4202.32] May it continue to bring tangible help to those in need around the world.
[4202.32 → 4209.50] Out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and you, O God, shall judge between the nations.
[4210.70 → 4216.74] We pray for our nation and all nations, that your peace would be manifest in every corner of the earth.
[4217.62 → 4222.30] As we reflect on the year past, we see one of escalating violence and unrest,
[4222.72 → 4226.94] with no end in sight for the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,
[4227.32 → 4229.08] and threats of new conflicts in Asia.
[4229.08 → 4233.76] We pray again for your peace to be upon all nations.
[4235.60 → 4241.84] In your kingdom, O Lord, wolves lie down with lambs, and children play with serpents without fear.
[4242.78 → 4247.24] We pray for the sick, the suffering, and those in distress of any kind,
[4247.56 → 4252.84] that you would heal all injuries, comfort all grief, and settle all wrongs.
[4253.48 → 4257.02] This time of year especially can be hard for many of us,
[4257.02 → 4263.14] with little daylight, rain, cold, and where even the busyness and preparations for the Christmas season
[4263.14 → 4265.84] can amplify loneliness and loss.
[4266.56 → 4270.54] We pray you will enable and motivate us to reach out to each other
[4270.54 → 4273.94] and lift those who suffer emotionally in this time.
[4273.94 → 4281.48] In your kingdom, O Lord, even the wilderness and dry land are glad and rejoice.
[4282.48 → 4287.52] We pray for those who rejoice this week as they celebrate their birthdays or anniversaries,
[4287.88 → 4291.64] that they might take joy and gladness from your faithfulness through the years.
[4292.32 → 4295.76] We give thanks especially this morning for Bart and Adriana Vanderkamp
[4295.76 → 4301.28] as they celebrate 60 years of marriage and pray for continued time together in the years ahead.
[4302.82 → 4308.22] In the fullness of time, O God, you sent your Son to be born of our sister Mary,
[4308.96 → 4311.50] and his name was Emmanuel, God with us.
[4312.16 → 4314.20] We thank you for your presence with us,
[4314.58 → 4319.82] and we pray that you might always be present with those whom we love but see no longer.
[4319.82 → 4323.24] O Christ, hear our prayers,
[4323.92 → 4324.64] restore us,
[4324.98 → 4327.64] and show us the glorious light of your countenance,
[4328.06 → 4329.22] that we might be saved.
[4329.68 → 4330.76] Come, Lord Jesus.
[4331.24 → 4331.44] Amen.
[4344.06 → 4345.50] So I want to invite you to stand,
[4345.50 → 4350.38] and we will go out with the blessing of the Lord upon us.
[4350.44 → 4354.02] I want to invite you to join us for a time of fellowship in our fellowship hall,
[4354.24 → 4357.64] and remember there is cake to be enjoyed and shared
[4357.64 → 4360.56] as we celebrate Bart and Adriana's 60th anniversary.
[4361.30 → 4366.28] So now I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4367.86 → 4372.48] May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, our Messiah and King,
[4372.48 → 4375.96] the love of God the Father who sent his beloved Son,
[4376.36 → 4379.72] and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit who comes to us each and every day
[4379.72 → 4382.32] be with you and remain with you now and forever.
[4382.76 → 4383.06] Amen.
[4383.06 → 4383.18] Amen.
[4402.48 → 4403.06] Amen.
[4403.06 → 4403.34] Amen.
[4403.34 → 4416.80] The Christians may rejoice, God in solemn voice,
[4416.80 → 4423.24] In the need to end we say, Jesus Christ is born today,
[4423.76 → 4429.96] He walked in us before Him now, and He is in the manger now,
[4430.38 → 4432.34] Christ is born today.
[4433.34 → 4436.56] Christ is born today.
[4438.20 → 4444.84] The Christian friends rejoice, with heart and soul and voice,
[4445.18 → 4451.44] Now we hear of endless mess, Jesus Christ was born for this,
[4451.86 → 4458.20] He has opened heaven's door, and we are blessed forevermore,
[4458.20 → 4465.60] Christ was born for this, Christ was born for this.
[4466.74 → 4473.54] The Christian friends rejoice, with heart and soul and voice,
[4473.92 → 4480.14] Now we need not fear the grave, Jesus Christ was born to see,
[4480.14 → 4486.90] Calls to one and calls to one to gain, His everlasting hope,
[4487.32 → 4493.80] Christ was born to see, Christ was born to see.
[4493.80 → 4497.12] We are dismissed.
[4497.12 → 4502.88] day and verse was born to deride men,
[4502.94 → 4516.92] for this we
