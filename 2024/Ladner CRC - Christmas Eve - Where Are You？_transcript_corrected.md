[340.18 → 342.18] Good evening to you all.
[342.18 → 350.18] And a warm welcome this evening to our Christmas Eve service at Lanner Christian Reformed Church.
[350.18 → 354.18] And if we haven't met, my name is Jason True.
[354.18 → 355.18] I'm the lead pastor here.
[355.18 → 358.18] And it is my privilege to welcome you this evening.
[358.18 → 364.18] And a special warm welcome to you, especially if you are guests, you know, maybe family or
[364.18 → 367.18] friends coming from out of town and are here with us tonight.
[367.18 → 369.18] Thank you so much for being here.
[369.18 → 375.18] I want to let you all know that tomorrow morning we also have a Christmas Day worship service
[375.18 → 377.18] at 10 o'clock right here.
[377.18 → 383.18] And you are all invited to join us to continue to worship on this Christmas.
[383.18 → 387.18] And so we have a special evening in store for you tonight.
[387.18 → 389.18] It is a story.
[389.18 → 397.18] It's the story of the promise and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ into the world as our Saviour.
[397.18 → 402.18] And it's a story that tonight will begin all the way back in the beginning with Adam and Eve.
[402.18 → 404.18] And you'll hear more about that shortly.
[404.18 → 413.18] But as we begin, I want to invite you to join me in prayer and give this service to the Lord as for his blessing.
[413.18 → 416.18] And then we will begin.
[416.18 → 417.18] So let's pray together.
[417.18 → 418.18] Thank you.
[418.18 → 419.18] Thank you.
[419.18 → 420.18] Thank you.
[420.18 → 424.18] Gracious God and Heavenly Father, we praise you this evening.
[424.18 → 428.18] You are the Lord who kept your promise from long ago.
[428.18 → 437.18] You sent your son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to come into the darkness of our world, the darkness of sin and sorrow.
[437.18 → 440.18] And you came as the light.
[440.18 → 443.18] You came in your holiness and righteousness.
[443.18 → 450.18] And you came, Lord, to save and to renew your people and this whole creation.
[450.18 → 452.18] And so, Lord, we praise you tonight.
[452.18 → 466.18] We thank you for this evening that we can set aside in our hearts and in our time to turn our attention and turn our hearts to the reason that we celebrate Christmas.
[466.18 → 469.18] And that is the coming of our Lord Jesus.
[469.18 → 471.18] And so, Lord, would you be with us this evening?
[471.18 → 473.18] Would you meet each one of us?
[473.18 → 478.18] And help us, Lord, to know you better and to worship you.
[478.18 → 480.18] We pray in Jesus' name.
[480.18 → 481.18] Amen.
[481.18 → 486.18] As we get started, I'll remind everyone to please put your phones on silent.
[486.18 → 487.18] Okay.
[487.18 → 488.18] Thank you.
[488.18 → 498.18] Before we get started,
[498.18 → 507.18] I'd like to invite any children that are here this evening to come up to the front for a little message.
[507.18 → 508.18] All right.
[508.18 → 510.18] I heard some kids in the back.
[510.18 → 516.18] And if they're too shy to come alone, they can bring a parent or someone with them.
[516.18 → 519.18] Come on up.
[519.18 → 520.18] There's a few of us.
[520.18 → 523.18] Just come and have a seat here.
[523.18 → 524.18] Okay.
[524.18 → 525.18] In front of the manger.
[525.18 → 526.18] Just sit right here.
[526.18 → 527.18] Oh, good.
[527.18 → 528.18] We've got some kids.
[528.18 → 529.18] I was getting worried.
[529.18 → 530.18] Hi, kids.
[530.18 → 538.18] Are you excited for Christmas?
[538.18 → 539.18] Yeah?
[539.18 → 543.18] Have you waited a long time for Christmas?
[543.18 → 544.18] A whole year, right?
[544.18 → 546.18] But it's almost here.
[546.18 → 559.18] Do you know that there are people in the Christmas story and in the world that were waiting for the very first Christmas?
[559.18 → 566.18] Who were some of the people that you think were waiting for Jesus to come?
[566.18 → 567.18] Mary.
[567.18 → 569.18] Anybody else?
[569.18 → 570.18] Who?
[570.18 → 571.18] Joseph.
[571.18 → 572.18] Yeah.
[572.18 → 576.18] Both Mary and Joseph were waiting.
[576.18 → 580.18] And there were the wholes, all of God's people were waiting.
[580.18 → 584.18] Can you tell me some other people who were in the Christmas story?
[584.18 → 588.18] Here are some other people that were in the Christmas story.
[588.18 → 591.18] Three ones.
[591.18 → 592.18] Yes.
[592.18 → 593.18] Shepherds.
[593.18 → 594.18] Yes.
[594.18 → 595.18] Anybody?
[595.18 → 596.18] Anybody else?
[596.18 → 597.18] I don't know.
[597.18 → 598.18] Okay.
[598.18 → 599.18] Okay.
[599.18 → 601.18] We have shepherds.
[601.18 → 603.18] We have wise men.
[603.18 → 604.18] We have angels.
[604.18 → 605.18] Right?
[605.18 → 606.18] Okay.
[606.18 → 611.18] Tonight, and Pastor Jason actually kind of gave it away.
[611.18 → 615.18] He gave away my little story.
[615.18 → 623.18] But I'm not going to tell you, but there's two people in the story tonight that we don't usually talk about in the Christmas story.
[623.18 → 632.18] So, I would like you to pay attention and listen to whom those two people are.
[632.18 → 633.18] Listen for them.
[633.18 → 639.18] And think about why they are an important part of the Christmas story.
[639.18 → 640.18] Can you do that?
[640.18 → 641.18] Okay.
[641.18 → 645.18] And before you go, would you sing the first verse of Away in a Manger with me?
[645.18 → 650.18] And then we will ask everybody to join on verses two and three.
[650.18 → 651.18] Okay?
[651.18 → 652.18] So, how's your name?
[652.18 → 653.18] Okay.
[653.18 → 674.18] And with a Manger, no grip for a bend, the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet hand.
[674.18 → 691.18] And with a Manger, no grip for a bend, the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet hand.
[691.18 → 692.18] Okay.
[692.18 → 696.18] And with a Manger, no grip for a bend, the little Lord Jesus lay down from the sky.
[696.18 → 698.18] And still the right side until morning is done.
[698.18 → 701.18] And with a Manger, no grip for a bend, the little Lord Jesus lay down from the sky.
[701.18 → 705.18] And still the right side until morning is done.
[705.18 → 710.18] And still the right side until morning is done.
[710.18 → 723.18] And still the right side until morning is done.
[723.18 → 724.18] If you are on treks, he will not.
[724.18 → 726.18] Tomb head to the low just.
[726.18 → 731.18] He will not.
[731.18 → 733.18] It is sizeable to do so.
[733.18 → 738.18] Because number three, may nay'Satan the Queen, the king O Matthew.
[738.18 → 739.18] EF exist to do so.
[739.18 → 741.18] The together trail often in the world Durham is done.
[741.18 → 743.18] For you in they, e OF, why-u-on- mash, where in they, your muscles March,
[743.18 → 746.18] M unseen, by heart.
[746.18 → 747.18] Goodrich- Bennett, Him!
[747.18 → 752.58] and bear us forever
[752.58 → 757.18] to live with you there.
[758.18 → 759.86] Okay, you can go back to your seats.
[760.02 → 760.92] Thank you so much.
[777.18 → 807.16] Thank you.
[807.18 → 817.18] Deep, within the dark woods, lost, so lost.
[817.18 → 822.68] Breath ragged, lungs and legs tired, so tired.
[822.68 → 828.98] A distant voice, familiar and urgent, calls out,
[828.98 → 831.36] where are you?
[832.20 → 836.32] Adam, Eve, where are you?
[837.18 → 845.18] There are no words to describe how incredible it was.
[845.18 → 849.18] God loved the world he had made, and he especially loved us.
[849.18 → 854.18] He said we were the crowning touch on his creation because we were
[854.18 → 859.18] different from all the other creatures, able to love, to reason,
[859.18 → 861.18] to make decisions, to create.
[861.18 → 867.18] In these ways, he made us to resemble himself.
[867.18 → 871.18] He called us his children, and we called him father.
[871.18 → 872.18] He was our king.
[872.18 → 875.18] We are his prince and princess.
[875.18 → 879.18] We delighted in the beauty all around us and took care of the earth as he
[879.18 → 880.18] instructed it.
[880.18 → 885.18] It was all so magnificent and perfect.
[885.18 → 891.18] Eve and I basked in our love for each other and our father.
[891.18 → 893.18] We were fulfilled and joyful.
[893.18 → 894.18] We were complete.
[894.18 → 898.18] We were complete.
[898.18 → 908.18] all the names and Hoo just gave He
[908.18 → 919.18] This is the Father's Word, as Him honestly gives.
[919.18 → 929.18] All nations sing and love we bring, the music of the Spirit.
[929.18 → 950.18] This is the Father's Word, as I see in the light, of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, in Israel the wondrous light.
[950.18 → 960.18] This is the Father's Word, the earth's and their host's race.
[960.18 → 970.18] The poor divine, the living white, the air their maker's race.
[970.18 → 981.18] This is the Father's Word, each of the Lord's name.
[981.18 → 993.18] In the rusting rust, my healing rust, leads me to me everywhere.
[993.18 → 1004.18] One day, the deceiver showed up with a pocket full of twisted lies.
[1004.18 → 1013.18] We listened to the trickster who wove his lies to make us think that, really, our Father's instructions weren't such a big deal.
[1013.18 → 1021.18] There stood the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, with its forbidden fruit.
[1021.18 → 1026.18] What's one little taste, anyway? Not so bad, right?
[1026.18 → 1029.18] We followed his sly suggestion.
[1029.18 → 1034.18] It's no excuse, but he made it look also so enticing.
[1034.18 → 1039.18] We were duped. To tell the truth, I was duped.
[1039.18 → 1045.18] At that moment, a flood of panic rose within me.
[1045.18 → 1054.18] I didn't want to be alone in this, so I invited Adam to be a part of my wild disobedience.
[1054.18 → 1057.18] Now everything was really going down fast.
[1057.18 → 1069.18] We both felt new and confusing emotions. Guilt, shame, fear, sadness, loneliness, and hate.
[1069.18 → 1074.18] How I despised the vile creature that had tempted me.
[1074.18 → 1080.18] The worst was how we had broken the bond of trust and love with our Father.
[1080.18 → 1084.18] We felt a sad estrangement from him.
[1084.18 → 1087.18] We had done wrong, pure and simple.
[1087.18 → 1094.18] And so we ran. We ran and ran. And we hid. We were so scared.
[1094.18 → 1102.18] We cowered low among the thick bushes, but he came looking.
[1102.18 → 1105.18] Our loving Father came to find us.
[1105.18 → 1108.18] But now everything was changed.
[1108.18 → 1112.18] His voice rang out in sadness, calling us by name.
[1112.18 → 1116.18] We were banished from that perfect garden we once called home.
[1116.18 → 1123.18] How could we stay in this place of perfection when we were so stained by the choices we made?
[1123.18 → 1129.18] In our new home, work was hard, and we had to live by the consequences.
[1129.18 → 1138.18] It's no surprise to you, I'm sure, that our actions, the ones that defied the life-giving ways of God,
[1138.18 → 1145.18] caused broken homes, violence, crimes of all kinds, injustice, war,
[1145.18 → 1149.18] and something we had never heard of before, death.
[1149.18 → 1157.18] One of our sons actually killed his own brother.
[1157.18 → 1159.18] Our world was shattered.
[1159.18 → 1166.18] We had broken the perfect bonds we had with the king, with each other, and with the earth.
[1166.18 → 1167.18] We had broken the world.
[1167.18 → 1169.18] Now joy came only in snippets.
[1169.18 → 1174.18] The hard ground made our work back-breaking.
[1174.18 → 1176.18] Weed sprang up everywhere.
[1176.18 → 1183.18] Worst of all, we had a constant hunger and thirst for our Father God.
[1183.18 → 1185.18] Everything was changed.
[1185.18 → 1194.18] If only we could go back to the paradise with the sweet flowing water of joyful and loving companionship.
[1194.18 → 1202.18] We had a constant hunger and loving companionship.
[1202.18 → 1206.18] On the day that God sent them from their perfect home,
[1206.18 → 1213.18] he promised that the dark deceiver, whose only plan was to bring death and destruction to the earth,
[1213.18 → 1217.18] would one day be defeated and doomed.
[1217.18 → 1227.18] On that day, the Creator promised to send his son, the perfect God-man, into the world to crush the deceiver.
[1227.18 → 1238.18] This God-man, the light of the world, would save his beloved children from the destructive path that they had chosen.
[1238.18 → 1245.18] So, God, the Lord, would have done this,
[1245.18 → 1251.18] for you above all livestock and all animals.
[1251.18 → 1257.18] You will crawl on your belly, and you will eat all the days of your life,
[1257.18 → 1265.18] and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and your offspring.
[1265.18 → 1271.08] He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.
[1274.72 → 1279.08] Throughout the following years, decades, and centuries,
[1279.92 → 1282.52] God did mighty things to rescue his people,
[1283.00 → 1285.78] but they just kept listening to the deceiver.
[1287.10 → 1292.52] God's prophets, his messengers, told about the God-man who would come,
[1292.52 → 1295.20] but no one knew when.
[1296.32 → 1300.56] Then suddenly, the prophets had no more words from God.
[1301.62 → 1303.16] They had all been said.
[1305.20 → 1306.00] Silence.
[1307.90 → 1312.64] The earth was waiting, holding its breath.
[1314.10 → 1315.92] Four centuries passed.
[1319.92 → 1321.02] Good evening.
[1321.02 → 1325.78] My name is Lemuel, and I'm an olive grower just outside of Jerusalem.
[1326.64 → 1332.26] I'm here to tell you, no one knew better about hardship than God's children, the people of Israel.
[1332.96 → 1336.00] The Romans were ruthless when they came to collect our taxes,
[1336.54 → 1339.26] when they shoved us aside as though we were nothing,
[1339.62 → 1343.58] when they took our food or possessions if we didn't have enough to pay what we owed.
[1343.58 → 1351.08] They wore their swords in full view to make sure we knew they weren't afraid to use them if we dared to challenge them.
[1351.86 → 1354.82] We were beaten down and lived in constant fear.
[1354.82 → 1360.14] There was never a better time for the words of the prophets to come true.
[1360.58 → 1364.42] We all knew the promise and spoke it often to keep our hope alive.
[1364.42 → 1370.44] Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[1370.44 → 1376.44] The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and will call him Emmanuel.
[1376.44 → 1381.12] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[1381.20 → 1386.76] On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
[1386.76 → 1395.30] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders,
[1395.78 → 1404.50] and he will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[1405.30 → 1410.12] Of the greatness of his government and peace, there will be no end.
[1410.12 → 1419.50] He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness
[1419.50 → 1422.70] from that time on and forever.
[1423.64 → 1427.10] The Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[1440.12 → 1470.10] The Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[1470.12 → 1500.10] The Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[1500.12 → 1508.12] The Lord is King.
[1518.12 → 1522.78] It was a very ordinary day in the little town of Nazareth.
[1522.78 → 1531.80] Just past the noon hour, and alone in the house, I had retired to a corner of our modest
[1531.80 → 1536.40] home where I lived with my father and mother.
[1536.40 → 1543.16] I was stitching a large tear in my father's robe, dreaming about my beloved Joseph and
[1543.16 → 1544.66] our wedding day.
[1544.66 → 1548.78] Oh, what a celebration that would be for us!
[1548.78 → 1555.08] I was thinking about how waiting was delicious and bitter all at once.
[1555.08 → 1559.36] But I knew the day would come, not long now.
[1559.36 → 1566.66] If I could get this robe repaired today, I could go back to stitching my wedding garment.
[1566.66 → 1573.30] Suddenly, I squinted into the brightest light I had ever seen.
[1573.30 → 1580.94] It was almost like looking into the sun, but the light was white and beautiful and did
[1580.94 → 1583.30] not hurt my eyes.
[1583.30 → 1587.02] I took a sharp breath, and my mouth fell open.
[1587.02 → 1591.06] My sewing fell to the floor as I jumped.
[1591.06 → 1600.30] Surely this must be an angel, such as the ones we had heard about in the scriptures of old.
[1600.30 → 1609.18] God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married
[1609.18 → 1613.46] to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[1613.46 → 1615.90] The virgin's name was Mary.
[1615.90 → 1621.40] The angel went to her and said, Greetings, you who are highly favoured.
[1621.40 → 1624.30] The Lord is with you.
[1624.30 → 1631.12] Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[1631.12 → 1635.54] But the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary.
[1635.54 → 1638.56] You have found favour with God.
[1638.56 → 1645.46] You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[1645.46 → 1651.18] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[1651.18 → 1657.36] The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over Jacob's
[1657.36 → 1659.38] descendants forever.
[1659.38 → 1667.22] His kingdom will never end.
[1667.22 → 1670.02] Do not be afraid.
[1670.02 → 1673.42] I really don't want to be afraid.
[1673.42 → 1677.54] This beautiful light is so extraordinary.
[1677.54 → 1680.58] This messenger from God.
[1680.58 → 1685.96] Even in all its beauty, its appearance is still a fearful thing.
[1685.96 → 1690.24] And the message, that too is fearful.
[1690.24 → 1694.02] I have one huge question rolling around in my head.
[1694.02 → 1697.02] How will this be?
[1697.02 → 1701.30] Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin.
[1701.30 → 1708.68] The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will
[1708.68 → 1710.80] overshadow you.
[1710.80 → 1715.74] So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[1715.74 → 1719.02] For no word from God will ever fail.
[1719.02 → 1731.58] I felt my heart-warming up in response to the deep love I felt in this promise.
[1731.58 → 1737.20] I have found favour with the Holy One, with my God.
[1737.20 → 1745.16] I knew that this Son of the Most High would be the Messiah promised so long ago.
[1745.16 → 1750.08] I will be the vessel used to bring the Messiah into the world.
[1750.08 → 1762.20] Yes, I say yes to what you want to do in and through me.
[1762.20 → 1776.16] I will be the vessel used to bring the Messiah into the Lord.
[1776.16 → 1781.16] I will be the vessel used to bring the Messiah into the Lord.
[1781.16 → 1782.16] He has done.
[1782.16 → 1795.16] He scatters the proud and rich.
[1795.16 → 1800.16] He lifts the humble and weak.
[1800.16 → 1811.06] He scatters the proud and rich, He lifts the humble and weak.
[1811.06 → 1821.76] The kings of the earth be cast from their thrones, And the hungry He welcomes to feast.
[1821.76 → 1832.76] O behold, my Saviour has come, And my soul will tell of His praise.
[1832.76 → 1846.76] For He who is strong has come to the wheel, And at last He will reign as our King of Peace.
[1851.76 → 1864.76] From now to the end of time, The nations will know me as last.
[1864.76 → 1874.76] For God has made you His promise of love, And mercy through Abraham's sea.
[1874.76 → 1887.76] O behold, my Saviour has come, And my soul will tell of His praise.
[1887.76 → 1899.76] For He who is strong has come to the wheel, And at last He will reign as our King of Peace.
[1899.76 → 1916.76] For He who is strong has come, And my soul will tell of His praise.
[1916.76 → 1929.76] For He who is strong has come to the wheel, And at last He will reign as our King of Peace.
[1929.76 → 1956.76] For He who is strong has come to the wheel, And at last He will reign as our King of Peace.
[1956.76 → 1963.76] O oh, oh, but what about Joseph?
[1963.76 → 1965.76] What will he think?
[1965.76 → 1968.76] What will he do?
[1968.76 → 1971.76] Do not be afraid.
[1971.76 → 1975.76] Do not be afraid.
[1975.76 → 1987.76] What will he do?
[1987.76 → 1992.76] Do not be afraid.
[1992.76 → 1995.42] When she had finished speaking, I was dumbfounded.
[1996.32 → 1998.46] Mary? Pregnant?
[1999.88 → 2004.20] Am I to believe that an angel appeared to her with this message?
[2005.04 → 2007.66] She left me to ponder this news.
[2007.92 → 2010.34] She was surprisingly calm through it all.
[2011.00 → 2012.52] That didn't make sense.
[2013.80 → 2016.74] I loved Mary deeply, and I respected her.
[2016.74 → 2021.12] Even if her story was true, and I wanted to believe it,
[2021.12 → 2027.52] I was afraid that she would be the brunt of gossip throughout all of Nazareth.
[2028.14 → 2032.08] I didn't want that to happen to her or to us.
[2033.02 → 2034.92] Perhaps I should dissolve our engagement,
[2035.24 → 2037.54] and she could go quietly to stay with a relative.
[2039.08 → 2042.50] I tossed and turned in the night, trying to resolve this matter.
[2042.88 → 2046.76] After many hours, I drifted into a troubled sleep.
[2046.76 → 2053.26] But after he had considered this,
[2053.56 → 2057.68] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[2058.42 → 2060.04] Joseph, son of David,
[2060.66 → 2063.94] do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[2064.30 → 2067.70] because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[2067.70 → 2070.78] She will give birth to a son,
[2071.48 → 2074.18] and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[2074.92 → 2078.16] because he will save his people from their sins.
[2079.34 → 2080.94] When Joseph woke up,
[2081.28 → 2084.32] he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him,
[2084.66 → 2087.56] and took Mary home as his wife.
[2087.56 → 2096.70] Toward the end of her term,
[2097.00 → 2099.86] we had to go to Bethlehem to register for taxes.
[2100.68 → 2103.02] I had no desire to leave Mary behind,
[2103.02 → 2105.06] but wondered if she could travel
[2105.06 → 2107.94] in such an advanced stage of pregnancy.
[2109.08 → 2110.98] She reasoned that all would be well.
[2111.48 → 2114.14] After all, wasn't this God's promise?
[2114.14 → 2116.58] He would keep us safe.
[2117.60 → 2120.56] We would have to plan a week to do the journey,
[2120.84 → 2123.48] for we would surely need to rest along the way.
[2124.34 → 2127.20] The roads were dusty and heavy with traffic.
[2127.54 → 2129.12] Many groups travelled together,
[2129.34 → 2131.58] but we were slower than most, so.
[2133.16 → 2136.96] We were so relieved to finally see Bethlehem come into view.
[2137.88 → 2139.62] And then the pains began.
[2139.62 → 2144.16] In those days,
[2144.48 → 2146.64] Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[2146.64 → 2150.80] that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[2151.70 → 2154.20] This was the first census that took place
[2154.20 → 2156.50] while Quirinus was governor of Syria.
[2157.24 → 2160.78] And everyone went to their own town to register.
[2161.84 → 2165.86] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee
[2165.86 → 2169.30] to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[2169.80 → 2173.22] because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[2174.16 → 2176.74] He went there to register with Mary,
[2177.08 → 2179.26] who was pledged to be married to him
[2179.26 → 2181.54] and was expecting a child.
[2182.60 → 2183.82] While they were there,
[2184.26 → 2186.70] the time came for the baby to be born,
[2187.42 → 2190.92] and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[2190.92 → 2195.14] She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger
[2195.14 → 2199.58] because there was no guest room available for them.
[2199.58 → 2200.30] INA
[2200.30 → 2205.18] who was dwelling before her
[2210.76 → 2215.52] could be mentioning something.
[2215.52 → 2216.20] Italian?
[2216.20 → 2217.16] Isn't valuation Ambrose?

[2243.92 → 2249.60] Jesus Christ, the little child.
[2249.62 → 2256.50] He came down to earth from heaven.
[2256.92 → 2262.02] He raised high for the Lord.
[2262.52 → 2267.52] And his child was a slave.
[2268.22 → 2273.22] And his grave was a star.
[2273.22 → 2279.22] Where the poor and weak and holy.
[2279.62 → 2285.62] In the hand of our Saviour holy.

[2301.62 → 2303.62] Amen.
[2303.62 → 2305.62] Amen.
[2305.62 → 2307.62] Amen.
[2307.62 → 2312.42] The animals resting there warmed the shelter for the family who had come to join them.
[2313.84 → 2316.38] God's promise had come true.
[2317.52 → 2319.36] The Messiah had arrived.
[2320.56 → 2324.62] But who would tell the world this wonderful news?
[2328.82 → 2336.12] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their lives at night.
[2336.12 → 2344.66] And the glory of the Lord shone around, and they were terrified.
[2345.66 → 2349.22] But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid.
[2349.90 → 2354.76] I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[2355.74 → 2360.34] Today in the town of David, a Saviour has been born to you.
[2361.04 → 2363.58] He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[2363.58 → 2366.42] Lord, this will be a sign to you.
[2367.16 → 2371.80] You will find a baby, thoughts, and lying in a manger.
[2373.30 → 2378.20] Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel,
[2378.82 → 2383.44] praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest heaven,
[2383.82 → 2387.90] and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests.
[2387.90 → 2406.40] O Lord, this pope and this priest Herod.
[2406.40 → 2413.08] let us sing, glory to the newborn King.
[2413.08 → 2423.24] Peace, honour, and mercy, my love, and sin has reconciled.
[2423.24 → 2433.36] Joyful of all ye nations, God, join the triumph of the skies.
[2433.36 → 2442.48] In the earth and the host of the day, Christ is born in their children.
[2442.48 → 2454.24] And in the dark, the earth and the angels sing, glory to the newborn King.
[2454.24 → 2465.28] My sight, eyes, and the Lord, Christ the everlasting Lord.
[2465.78 → 2475.24] Late in time behold Him come, offspring of the Virgin's birth.
[2475.24 → 2485.24] Hail in question, love and sea, hail in fire, and the angels sing.
[2485.24 → 2494.24] He is the friend with us to know, Jesus, our Emmanuel.
[2494.24 → 2504.24] Hail in question, love and sea, hail in fire, and the angels sing.
[2504.24 → 2508.24] Glory to the newborn King.
[2508.24 → 2518.24] Hail in the heavens of peace, hail of sorrow, righteousness.
[2518.24 → 2528.24] Bright and blind, holy peace, this heavenly strength.
[2528.24 → 2538.24] My goodness is glory, Lord, that we know, glory to the Lord.
[2538.24 → 2548.24] Lord, to raise us from the earth, Lord, to make us surrender.
[2548.24 → 2564.24] To the Lord, to the Lord, that we know, glory to the Lord.
[2564.24 → 2566.24] I've never been so scared in my life.
[2566.24 → 2568.24] Who wouldn't be?
[2568.24 → 2574.24] This big, bright being flooding us with light.
[2574.24 → 2578.24] We had scared off wild dogs and other beasts before to save the sheep.
[2578.24 → 2580.24] But this?
[2580.24 → 2583.24] There's no way to fight this.
[2583.24 → 2586.24] What we were seeing was not of this earth.
[2586.24 → 2588.24] That was very clear.
[2588.24 → 2594.24] We fell to the ground, shaking in our sandals.
[2594.24 → 2596.24] Oh, we sure did.
[2596.24 → 2601.24] But then we heard this voice, gentle, comforting.
[2601.24 → 2603.24] Don't be afraid.
[2603.24 → 2605.24] Don't be afraid.
[2605.24 → 2608.24] I've got the best news for you.
[2608.24 → 2610.24] It will fill you with joy.
[2610.24 → 2612.24] News?
[2612.24 → 2613.24] Good news?
[2613.24 → 2614.24] For us?
[2614.24 → 2617.24] What kind of great news would come to us?
[2617.24 → 2620.24] We were low on the social ladder.
[2620.24 → 2622.24] Our lives were simple.
[2622.24 → 2626.24] We lived in the fields and cared for the sheep.
[2626.24 → 2630.24] And made sure they didn't get lost or attacked.
[2630.24 → 2633.24] What kind of news could this be for us?
[2633.24 → 2635.24] We dared to look up.
[2635.24 → 2637.24] And then received the news.
[2637.24 → 2639.24] The Messiah had arrived.
[2639.24 → 2644.24] The one we and all Israel had waited so long for.
[2644.24 → 2646.24] Could it be true?
[2646.24 → 2655.24] The angel told us where to find the newborn and what to look for.
[2655.24 → 2661.24] And then suddenly the sky was filled with a whole army of these heavenly beings chanting,
[2661.24 → 2665.24] glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth.
[2665.24 → 2673.24] Surrounded by this cloud of heavenly beings, hearing their beautiful praise, our fear left us.
[2673.24 → 2678.24] And a joyful excitement began to well up in our bodies and spirits.
[2678.24 → 2685.24] How could we not set off to see this little Prince of Peace for ourselves?
[2685.24 → 2687.24] We left the sheep resting.
[2687.24 → 2693.24] Somehow we knew that deserting our post on this night would be the right thing to do.
[2693.24 → 2695.24] Off we went.
[2695.24 → 2696.24] We went.
[2696.24 → 2702.24] Please stand to sing the first two verses of Joy to the World.
[2702.24 → 2703.24] Joy to the World.
[2703.24 → 2704.24] Joy to the World by Matteo & Paraense D fooled!
[2704.24 → 2712.24] Let us see the glory of God at all each and everyone.
[2712.24 → 2724.24] For to the world the Lord is come, and the world is free for me.
[2724.24 → 2743.24] Let every heart and every room, let heaven and nature sing, let heaven and nature sing.
[2743.24 → 2762.48] For to the earth the Saviour and all the songs and songs, all fields and clouds, all fields and plains,
[2762.48 → 2776.48] we meet the sounding door, we meet the sounding door, we meet the sounding door.
[2784.48 → 2790.48] When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
[2790.48 → 2797.28] let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[2798.38 → 2805.52] So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in a manger.
[2806.58 → 2812.92] When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,
[2813.60 → 2818.22] and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherd said to them.
[2818.22 → 2824.44] But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[2825.38 → 2832.48] The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen,
[2832.98 → 2835.42] which were just as they had been told.
[2835.42 → 2843.58] When we found the mother and father hovering over the manger where the child was laying,
[2844.00 → 2846.22] we fell on our knees to worship him.
[2846.70 → 2849.06] We got to see him with our own eyes.
[2849.64 → 2851.52] How can we find words for this?
[2851.96 → 2856.72] We were overflowing with joy, with thanks, with humility,
[2857.22 → 2859.66] and an excitement that just wouldn't stop.
[2859.66 → 2866.68] After a while, we knew we had to leave the family to rest.
[2867.16 → 2868.74] It was time to go back to the sheep.
[2869.48 → 2872.08] The daylight was just breaking as we headed back.
[2873.18 → 2876.08] People were beginning to stir, to come out of their homes,
[2876.44 → 2879.44] to start their morning chores, going to the nearest well,
[2879.90 → 2882.24] preparing to open their market stalls or shops.
[2882.24 → 2888.36] We stopped everyone that we met, and we told them that the Messiah had come.
[2888.90 → 2890.18] We couldn't hold it in.
[2890.90 → 2892.96] Oh, some people were too busy to listen,
[2893.40 → 2896.54] but others were curious and asked us about what had happened.
[2897.08 → 2900.08] And we told them, just as we are telling you.
[2900.88 → 2903.96] There was a growing sense of amazement as we made our way back.
[2904.30 → 2910.08] We couldn't contain the wonderful news that our Saviour was here at last.
[2910.08 → 2916.08] Our fear had turned into unimaginable joy and incredible peace.
[2920.66 → 2925.68] Finally, finally, finally, finally, I was just getting started on my day,
[2926.12 → 2930.12] preparing to pick olives when some shepherds came skipping down the road.
[2930.80 → 2934.94] I'd never seen such a dance from men, even as uncultured as them.
[2935.48 → 2939.08] I wondered if they had a wild night and hadn't yet sobered up.
[2939.08 → 2943.44] But they came right into the orchard and told me their amazing story.
[2944.12 → 2946.14] Their joy was real and infectious.
[2946.90 → 2949.08] I just knew that he had finally come.
[2949.86 → 2953.02] I felt my fear of the Romans start to drain away already.
[2953.02 → 2967.52] Oh, time on the mountain,
[2967.52 → 2967.58] Oh, day on the mountain,
[2967.78 → 2971.62] A burden that Sam andithане
[2971.62 → 2975.72] Come on, tell me on the mountain,
[2975.72 → 2980.04] that Jesus Christ is born.
[2980.04 → 2984.20] All shepherds kept there watching
[2984.20 → 2988.04] your silent cross by night.
[2989.00 → 2992.04] Behold you of the heavens,
[2993.18 → 2997.16] where shall thou hold me now?
[2997.16 → 3003.40] Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.
[3003.50 → 3008.30] For the earth and every earth
[3008.30 → 3011.68] comes a young man
[3011.68 → 3016.10] that Jesus Christ is born.
[3017.10 → 3020.82] And the earth's here and trampled
[3020.82 → 3024.80] and flow above the earth
[3024.80 → 3033.04] And help the angel for us, that hail the Saviour's good.
[3035.98 → 3043.80] All the young man of the Saviour, all the hills and the hills,
[3044.80 → 3052.26] all the young man of the Saviour, Jesus Christ is born.
[3052.26 → 3061.70] In the holy manger, the humble Christ was born,
[3062.30 → 3070.32] and the Son of the Son of the Son, and the blessed Christmas more.
[3070.32 → 3080.32] All the young man of the Son, and the holy manger, all the hills and the hills,
[3080.32 → 3085.32] and the hills and the hills, all the young man of the Son,
[3085.32 → 3095.32] and the hills and the hills, all the hills, all the hills, all the hills.
[3095.32 → 3101.00] The angel was right.
[3102.12 → 3104.26] I didn't need to fear.
[3105.34 → 3111.66] God was true to his promises in Scripture, and to me, and to Joseph.
[3112.62 → 3115.96] I still had much to ponder and reflect on.
[3115.96 → 3123.34] I was blessed to care for my Lord, my Son, the one who had come to save me.
[3124.42 → 3129.72] It became a rich pastime, mothering, nursing my child,
[3130.54 → 3136.40] while considering the mystery of what was and would be taking place
[3136.40 → 3141.90] in our lives through Jesus, who would somehow save the world.
[3141.90 → 3149.12] Adam and I had been filled with fear.
[3149.82 → 3153.32] It was the only possible response to what we had done
[3153.32 → 3155.64] and the consequences that followed.
[3156.64 → 3160.38] We had surrendered to temptation instead of to God.
[3161.20 → 3162.80] That is a fearful thing.
[3163.90 → 3166.74] My children and all generations following
[3166.74 → 3170.70] would never be what they were fully intended to be,
[3171.22 → 3172.74] perfect, until...
[3175.74 → 3184.12] Until the child Jesus, the Messiah, was born,
[3185.08 → 3188.52] the Son of God, taking on a human body,
[3188.92 → 3192.20] would show us the Father's never-ending love
[3192.20 → 3197.64] and give his life to redeem what we all did.
[3199.16 → 3201.20] We all failed to love God,
[3202.00 → 3204.08] to love and care for each other,
[3204.58 → 3207.68] and to love the earth and care for it.
[3208.74 → 3211.94] All the things you, Adam and Eve,
[3212.26 → 3215.08] were doing in the first place.
[3215.08 → 3219.20] Eve, do you see it now?
[3219.82 → 3223.22] What God promised to do to deceiver is coming to pass.
[3224.24 → 3227.82] He's going down, and we are freed from our guilt and shame.
[3228.70 → 3229.58] It's okay, Eve.
[3229.96 → 3232.20] God is making it all okay.
[3232.20 → 3233.34] Put.
[3234.36 → 3235.20] Amen.
[3235.34 → 3235.94] Go home.
[3235.94 → 3248.72] O another, O-H-A-K-K-E-N-N-E.
[3252.88 → 3253.00] O-H-A-K-EE-S-E-G-GE,
[3253.00 → 3255.00] Oh
[3283.00 → 3285.00] Oh
[3313.00 → 3315.00] Oh
[3317.20 → 3321.92] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son
[3322.38 → 3327.46] That whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
[3328.76 → 3336.02] For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him
[3336.02 → 3343.10] Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe
[3343.68 → 3345.68] stands condemned already
[3345.90 → 3351.30] Because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only son
[3354.26 → 3362.24] Adam remember how afraid we were and how unsatisfied with life after we were sent from the garden
[3362.24 → 3369.16] Remember how we hungered for God's perfect companionship and how dry we felt
[3369.90 → 3377.54] Like we were always in a desert with snakes slithering around our feet and the grit of sand in our teeth
[3379.68 → 3383.48] Then Jesus declared I am the bread of life
[3384.24 → 3391.78] Whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty
[3392.24 → 3400.24] But now come
[3400.90 → 3404.00] Come look inside this manger
[3405.28 → 3407.28] Here he is
[3407.28 → 3410.48] The perfect God perfect humanity
[3411.90 → 3415.24] In the beginning he made us like himself
[3416.00 → 3418.80] But now he has become one of us
[3418.80 → 3422.80] How strangely wonderful this is
[3424.80 → 3426.80] He comes to exchange our fear for his peace
[3428.80 → 3432.80] Our despair for his hope and our despondency for his joy
[3434.80 → 3436.80] Behold this is our Saviour
[3438.80 → 3442.80] The Messiah the Prince of Peace and the light of the world
[3442.80 → 3444.80] modelling
[3444.80 → 3462.98] character and every
[3462.98 → 3464.80] earth price
[3464.80 → 3466.80] of the world
[3466.80 → 3482.88] All ye faithful, joyful and triumphal, come, come, O God, we to heaven.
[3482.88 → 3499.06] Come and behold Him, for the King of angels, O come, let us adore Him.
[3499.06 → 3514.06] O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[3514.06 → 3530.54] May your heavenly, for this happy morning, Jesus, to be in the Lord.
[3530.54 → 3554.54] May your heavenly, for this happy morning, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
[3554.54 → 3565.54] O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[3565.54 → 3587.86] From the deep dark woods into the bright clearing, in an endless stream, the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve emerge dancing.
[3587.86 → 3598.32] From the cold night of their guilty fears, towards the light of the world, who wraps them in a warm covering of peace.
[3599.36 → 3616.36] A loving voice sings over them, I have come to find you, I am here, I call you by name, my child, I have come for you.
[3617.86 → 3636.30] A loving voice
[3636.30 → 3641.46] Holy night, holy night.
[3642.54 → 3650.22] All is strong, all is right.
[3650.22 → 3658.66] Round yon virgin, mother and child.
[3658.66 → 3667.10] Holy in the soul, tender and mild.
[3667.96 → 3675.60] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3676.14 → 3681.70] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3681.70 → 3711.68] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3711.70 → 3741.68] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3741.68 → 3743.68] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3743.68 → 3749.68] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3749.68 → 3753.68] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[3753.68 → 3761.84] Radiant beams from thy holy face,
[3761.84 → 3770.98] with the dawn of redeeming grace.
[3771.68 → 3778.60] Jesus, Lord, at thy birth,
[3778.60 → 3787.60] Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
[3808.60 → 3815.60] Amen.
[3838.60 → 3845.60] Amen.
