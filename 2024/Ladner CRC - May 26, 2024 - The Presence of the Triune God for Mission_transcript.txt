[180.00 --> 197.16]  Good morning.
[197.16 --> 198.16]  Good morning.
[198.16 --> 204.00]  Welcome to all, especially our visitors and those viewing this service on livestream.
[204.00 --> 208.00]  May you feel a part of our gathering here.
[208.00 --> 211.76]  My name is Bev Banstra and I will be leading this worship service.
[211.76 --> 217.32]  Pastor Jason will be bringing us God's word later in the service.
[217.32 --> 221.94]  After the service, everyone is invited to join in a time of conversation and coffee in our
[221.94 --> 226.26]  fellowship hall at the back of the building.
[226.26 --> 232.60]  This is Trinity Sunday, celebrated as early as the 10th century.
[232.60 --> 240.12]  It is the first Sunday after Pentecost and it focuses on the mystery, power, and beauty
[240.12 --> 242.70]  of the triune God.
[242.70 --> 246.98]  We will hear more about this in Pastor Jason's sermon.
[246.98 --> 249.36]  One announcement.
[249.36 --> 254.32]  Jeanette Vanderwild passed into glory on Monday, May 20th.
[254.32 --> 260.44]  Our condolences to the Vanderwild family, especially Gina and Dave Fraser.
[260.44 --> 268.24]  The memorial service will be on Saturday, June 8th at 11 o'clock.
[268.24 --> 271.96]  We will hear our call to worship.
[271.96 --> 278.92]  Jesus prayed that we, the church, would be one, just as he and the Father are one.
[278.92 --> 286.08]  Today we offer our praise and prayer together as one body in Christ through the power of
[286.08 --> 288.48]  the Holy Spirit.
[288.48 --> 295.10]  Let us glorify God, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[295.10 --> 302.68]  Please stand if you are able.
[302.68 --> 307.34]  Here is our prayer of adoration.
[307.34 --> 310.16]  Praise be to you, O God the Father.
[310.16 --> 315.82]  You created all things by your power and wisdom and so loved the world that you gave your Son
[315.82 --> 318.36]  to be our Savior.
[318.36 --> 321.18]  Praise be to you, O God the Son.
[321.18 --> 325.68]  You became human like us in all things except sin.
[325.68 --> 331.22]  Died for our offenses and rose again for our justification.
[331.22 --> 334.50]  Praise be to you, O God the Holy Spirit.
[334.50 --> 339.12]  You lead us in all truth and spread the love of God in our hearts.
[339.12 --> 346.68]  All praise and glory be to you, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, forever and ever.
[346.68 --> 347.68]  Amen.
[347.68 --> 353.50]  God greets us this morning with these words from 2 Corinthians.
[353.50 --> 359.72]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father and the fellowship
[359.72 --> 362.54]  of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[362.54 --> 365.54]  As God has greeted us, let us greet one another.
[365.54 --> 371.36]  minute one another.
[371.36 --> 374.30]  Thank you.
[374.30 --> 404.28]  Thank you.
[404.30 --> 412.60]  Let's sing together across the lands.
[412.60 --> 442.58]  Let's sing together across the lands.
[442.58 --> 444.58]  Let's sing together.
[444.58 --> 446.58]  Let's sing together.
[446.58 --> 448.58]  Let's sing together.
[448.58 --> 452.12]  Let the skies declare your glory.
[452.58 --> 455.84]  Let the land and seas rejoice.
[456.22 --> 458.96]  You're the author of creation.
[459.72 --> 462.58]  You're the Lord of everyone.
[462.58 --> 468.58]  And your cry of love breaks out across the lands.
[470.58 --> 473.58]  And you lift the gaze of angels.
[473.58 --> 476.58]  Came to sing and sing along.
[477.58 --> 484.58]  And exchange the joy of heaven for the anguish of the cross.
[484.58 --> 487.58]  With the prayer you fed, thou humbly.
[488.38 --> 491.58]  With the word you come to see.
[491.92 --> 494.58]  Yet not silently you suffer.
[495.38 --> 498.38]  Let the guilty may go free.
[498.94 --> 501.78]  You're the author of creation.
[502.50 --> 505.04]  You're the Lord of everyone.
[505.04 --> 512.04]  And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[513.18 --> 516.14]  With the shout you rose victorious.
[516.72 --> 519.04]  Resting victory from the grave.
[520.04 --> 523.38]  And ascended into heaven.
[523.66 --> 526.04]  Leading captives in your way.
[526.04 --> 530.04]  Now you stand before the Father.
[531.04 --> 533.04]  Interceding for your own.
[534.04 --> 537.14]  From each tribe and tongue and nation.
[537.76 --> 540.04]  You are leading sailors home.
[541.04 --> 544.04]  You're the author of creation.
[544.78 --> 547.04]  You're the Lord of everyone.
[547.04 --> 554.04]  And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[554.04 --> 558.24]  You're the author of creation.
[558.84 --> 561.48]  You're the Lord of everyone.
[562.40 --> 569.04]  And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[573.04 --> 574.36]  Amen.
[577.04 --> 578.20]  Amen.
[592.06 --> 592.34]  Amen.
[592.48 --> 592.92]  Amen.
[597.00 --> 600.64]  Amen.
[600.86 --> 601.78]  Amen.
[601.78 --> 603.80]  Amen.
[603.80 --> 605.50]  of heaven
[605.50 --> 607.90]  and God's
[607.90 --> 609.90]  will unfailingly
[611.58 --> 611.90]  be
[611.90 --> 613.90]  to his people
[614.44 --> 615.96]  given
[615.96 --> 617.90]  Almighty
[617.90 --> 620.18]  God, you

[621.94 --> 623.90]  we worship you
[624.56 --> 626.02]  our thanks
[626.02 --> 626.96]  we pray
[626.96 --> 629.82]  we praise you for
[629.82 --> 631.90]  your glory
[631.90 --> 637.82]  O Lamb of God
[637.82 --> 640.32]  Lord Jesus Christ
[640.32 --> 641.92]  whom God
[641.92 --> 643.26]  the Father
[643.26 --> 645.62]  gave us
[645.62 --> 647.90]  who for the world
[648.46 --> 649.90]  was sacrificed
[650.72 --> 653.66]  upon the cross
[653.66 --> 656.30]  to save us
[656.30 --> 658.04]  and God's
[658.04 --> 659.90]  right hand you
[659.90 --> 661.44]  intercede
[661.44 --> 663.16]  for those

[665.80 --> 666.78]  plead

[677.40 --> 680.14]  the holy one

[684.74 --> 688.12]  and only you
[688.12 --> 690.74]  are God's true son

[722.60 --> 723.28]  is the hope
[723.28 --> 724.78]  of the nations
[724.78 --> 725.44]  and we'll
[725.44 --> 726.78]  sing that one
[726.78 --> 727.52]  together now
[727.52 --> 737.08]  our
[738.48 --> 739.58]  love
[739.58 --> 741.06]  Jesus
[745.06 --> 745.60]  pou��
[745.60 --> 753.46]  Jesus, hope of the nations
[753.46 --> 759.20]  Jesus, comfort for all of all
[759.20 --> 764.96]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[764.96 --> 769.82]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[769.82 --> 774.24]  Jesus, truth in His earth stands
[774.24 --> 781.38]  You are the source of heaven's love on earth
[781.38 --> 786.08]  In history you lived and had
[786.08 --> 790.12]  You broke the chains, you rose to life
[790.12 --> 795.32]  You are the hope living in us
[795.32 --> 799.26]  You are the rock in whom we trust
[799.26 --> 806.40]  You are the light shining for all the world to see
[806.40 --> 811.10]  You rose from the dead, under in fear
[811.10 --> 815.32]  Our prince of peace drawing us near
[815.32 --> 822.46]  Jesus is our hope living for all who will receive
[822.46 --> 825.60]  Lord, we believe
[825.60 --> 836.60]  Jesus, hope of the nations
[836.60 --> 841.60]  Jesus, comfort for all of the Lord
[841.60 --> 847.72]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[847.72 --> 852.86]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[852.86 --> 857.94]  Jesus, truth in each circle of sense
[857.94 --> 863.86]  You are the source of heaven's love on earth
[863.86 --> 868.68]  In history you lived and died
[868.68 --> 872.72]  You broke the chains, you rose to life
[872.72 --> 877.86]  You are the hope living in us
[877.86 --> 881.86]  You are the rock in whom we trust
[881.86 --> 887.86]  You are the light shining for all the world to see
[887.86 --> 893.86]  You rose from the dead, under in fear
[893.86 --> 897.00]  Our prince of peace drawing us near
[897.00 --> 905.00]  Jesus is our hope living for all who will receive
[905.00 --> 908.00]  Lord, we believe
[908.00 --> 912.00]  Lord, we believe
[912.00 --> 916.00]  Lord, we believe
[916.00 --> 921.50]  You may be seated
[921.50 --> 951.48]  Lord, we believe
[951.48 --> 981.46]  Lord, we believe
[981.46 --> 1011.44]  Lord, we believe
[1011.44 --> 1012.44]  Lord, we believe
[1012.44 --> 1041.42]  Lord, we believe
[1041.42 --> 1049.36]  Father, we long to be led by your Spirit, though we may complain along the path.
[1050.58 --> 1056.64]  Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil, for you are with me.
[1056.92 --> 1059.96]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[1061.02 --> 1064.60]  And yet, Lord, we do sometimes fear.
[1064.60 --> 1071.16]  May we feel your presence, your comfort, and for your forgiveness anew.
[1072.10 --> 1076.40]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[1077.40 --> 1079.16]  You anoint my head with oil.
[1080.16 --> 1081.70]  My cup overflows.
[1083.14 --> 1087.48]  Oh, sometimes we refuse to sit down at your table.
[1088.36 --> 1092.48]  Forgive us and help us to see overflowing mercy.
[1093.88 --> 1098.02]  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
[1098.02 --> 1103.08]  and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.
[1104.18 --> 1108.44]  Forgive us, God, and lead us into your house.
[1109.92 --> 1112.84]  And God assures us with these words of forgiveness.
[1112.84 --> 1120.00]  Even in the darkest valley, though light death's shadow may threaten us,
[1120.92 --> 1124.02]  we need not fear, for the Lord is with us.
[1124.44 --> 1126.30]  God will comfort and shelter us.
[1127.38 --> 1130.82]  No one can snatch us out of the Lord's hand.
[1130.82 --> 1133.92]  This is the good news we have declared.
[1134.86 --> 1141.06]  God loves us so deeply that he leads us out of the shadows to walk in the light of Christ.
[1141.82 --> 1146.62]  In the power of the Holy Spirit, we can rejoice in this new life.
[1146.62 --> 1150.06]  This is the word we have heard.
[1150.70 --> 1156.18]  Our faithful God forgives our sins and raises us to new life.
[1156.88 --> 1159.26]  Thanks be to God. Amen.
[1160.56 --> 1162.92]  We're going to be singing Psalm 23,
[1163.46 --> 1166.82]  and I just want to give a short intro to this song.
[1167.32 --> 1171.20]  Stuart Townend, the composer of the setting of Psalm 23, writes,
[1171.20 --> 1178.12]  The psalm is familiar to many as a psalm of comfort in, for example, funeral services.
[1178.88 --> 1183.38]  But I also noticed that the psalm uses a lot of movement imagery,
[1184.08 --> 1186.80]  walking, leading, following.
[1187.36 --> 1192.58]  That speaks of an active response of faith to what the psalm is saying.
[1193.28 --> 1197.78]  We are to live each day believing goodness and mercy are following us,
[1197.78 --> 1203.08]  that there are still waters and green pastures to be found.
[1227.78 --> 1236.72]  The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.
[1236.72 --> 1242.58]  He makes me lie in pastures green.
[1242.96 --> 1248.60]  He leads me by the still, still waters.
[1249.52 --> 1253.72]  His goodness restores my soul.
[1253.72 --> 1259.46]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1260.26 --> 1265.24]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1266.38 --> 1272.50]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[1272.76 --> 1277.64]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[1277.64 --> 1285.18]  He guides my ways in righteousness.
[1285.18 --> 1291.60]  And He avoids my head with all.
[1292.60 --> 1298.70]  And my cup in overflows with joy.
[1298.70 --> 1303.86]  I feast on His pure delights.
[1303.86 --> 1309.70]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1309.70 --> 1315.16]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1315.16 --> 1322.08]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[1322.08 --> 1327.36]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[1327.36 --> 1336.10]  And though I walk the darkest path,
[1336.10 --> 1342.12]  I will not fear the evil one.
[1342.12 --> 1343.12]  For you are with me.
[1343.12 --> 1345.12]  For you are with me.
[1345.12 --> 1353.86]  And your rod and staff are the comfort I need to know.
[1353.86 --> 1358.86]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1358.86 --> 1364.60]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1364.60 --> 1371.60]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[1371.60 --> 1377.60]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[1377.60 --> 1383.86]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[1383.86 --> 1398.60]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[1398.60 --> 1403.14]  And at this time, the goodness of God is going to lead our young children to Sunday school,
[1403.54 --> 1404.08]  kids life.
[1404.60 --> 1407.96]  And blessings on you, children, and on your teachers too.
[1407.96 --> 1430.96]  Good morning.
[1430.96 --> 1435.28]  Good morning.
[1435.28 --> 1440.08]  As Bev said, it is today Trinity Sunday.
[1440.08 --> 1448.54]  And we believe that the one true and living God that we worship is the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[1448.54 --> 1453.78]  So we believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons.
[1453.92 --> 1455.58]  Each person is distinct.
[1456.08 --> 1458.68]  And each person is equally God.
[1459.00 --> 1461.32]  Equal in power and might and glory.
[1461.32 --> 1465.78]  And this is truly a mysterious thing.
[1465.78 --> 1471.40]  But even though we do not, we cannot fully understand it, we can know God.
[1471.40 --> 1477.68]  We can relate to him because he has revealed himself to us in his word.
[1477.68 --> 1483.18]  And so let's open God's word together so that we can relate to him and we can know him more.
[1483.18 --> 1486.82]  And our text this morning is John chapter 20.
[1486.82 --> 1488.38]  So please turn there with me.
[1488.38 --> 1492.66]  Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, John chapter 20.
[1500.56 --> 1503.86]  And that is on page 808 of your Pew Bible.
[1504.64 --> 1505.96]  Page 808.
[1505.96 --> 1523.72]  And so this morning we are actually wrapping up our Easter sermon series where we have been looking at those times when Jesus comes to be with his disciples after his resurrection from the dead.
[1523.72 --> 1527.88]  And so in our text this morning, it is Easter morning.
[1528.54 --> 1536.62]  And Jesus comes to be with his disciples in order to send them out on mission.
[1537.40 --> 1539.02]  Okay, to send them out on mission.
[1539.16 --> 1540.54]  So let's read this short passage.
[1541.68 --> 1543.60]  John 20 verses 19 to 23.
[1543.60 --> 1555.28]  On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, peace be with you.
[1556.12 --> 1559.38]  After he said this, he showed them his hands inside.
[1559.88 --> 1562.74]  The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
[1562.74 --> 1565.80]  Again, Jesus said, peace be with you.
[1566.26 --> 1570.22]  As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.
[1570.92 --> 1574.48]  And with that, he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit.
[1575.14 --> 1578.04]  If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven.
[1578.66 --> 1582.04]  If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.
[1582.96 --> 1584.24]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1584.24 --> 1587.48]  So let's pray together.
[1587.84 --> 1591.16]  Ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[1591.24 --> 1591.64]  Let's pray.
[1592.38 --> 1596.28]  Father in heaven, we thank you for these words from our Lord Jesus.
[1597.02 --> 1598.94]  They are absolutely true.
[1599.26 --> 1602.02]  And Lord, you give them to us because you love us.
[1602.14 --> 1604.22]  You want us to know you and relate to you.
[1604.98 --> 1612.00]  So Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit would teach them to us and apply them to our lives individually and as a church community.
[1612.00 --> 1621.34]  And Lord, we pray that you would give us both faith to believe in what you say and obedience to follow you.
[1622.12 --> 1624.08]  We open our hearts to you now.
[1624.60 --> 1625.92]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[1626.04 --> 1626.30]  Amen.
[1627.58 --> 1629.62]  And so it is Trinity Sunday.
[1630.06 --> 1635.34]  And as we think about that, our topic today, the theme, is actually mission.
[1635.68 --> 1637.24]  Okay, the theme of today is mission.
[1637.48 --> 1638.58]  The mission of the church.
[1638.58 --> 1648.56]  And there is one figure who has helped the church to really reimagine our missionary identity as much as anyone else.
[1648.56 --> 1653.36]  And it is a missionary, a theologian, and author by the name of Leslie Newbigin.
[1654.12 --> 1656.76]  So here's a photo of Leslie Newbigin.
[1657.66 --> 1667.76]  He and his wife spent 30 years as missionaries in India from the late 1930s to about the mid-1970s.
[1667.76 --> 1676.72]  And while he was there in India, there was actually back home in England a dramatic change that was happening.
[1676.86 --> 1686.24]  It was a cultural change, a change in society all across the Western world, in Europe, and in England where he was from.
[1686.24 --> 1696.70]  So when he left to go to India as a missionary, England was largely Christian in that most people would claim to be a Christian.
[1697.10 --> 1699.42]  The church was thriving.
[1699.94 --> 1701.96]  The church had influence in society.
[1701.96 --> 1712.48]  But what he discovered when he returned to England 30 years later was that England had itself become a mission field.
[1714.32 --> 1717.36]  Christianity in England was in steep decline.
[1717.92 --> 1722.88]  And the West had become what he called a post-Christendom culture.
[1722.88 --> 1731.04]  The West had become essentially a new missionary frontier, representing new challenges and new opportunities.
[1731.76 --> 1737.46]  But he also discovered when he returned to England that the church was not ready for these changes.
[1737.88 --> 1747.52]  They were still just kind of going about their life as the church, as though mission were still something that you do somewhere else.
[1747.52 --> 1752.02]  Somewhere off in far off lands, we send missionaries there.
[1752.68 --> 1759.62]  And what they had to do was reimagine their own missionary calling, their own missionary identity, right where they were.
[1760.88 --> 1766.26]  And so Leslie Newbigin, he didn't come back to retire, but he saw this new challenge.
[1766.26 --> 1778.90]  And he began to write and preach and speak to remind the church that the church is, in all times and in all places, always on mission.
[1780.42 --> 1787.22]  And especially when the church feels marginalized and weak.
[1789.00 --> 1794.94]  That isn't the time when the church is in decline, when we feel weak.
[1794.94 --> 1796.74]  We don't have influence on our culture.
[1797.18 --> 1799.20]  That's not the time to circle the wagons.
[1799.30 --> 1802.40]  It's not the time to retreat from the world.
[1803.16 --> 1807.24]  Rather, it's an opportunity to ask, what is the church's mission?
[1808.64 --> 1809.98]  What is the church's mission?
[1811.72 --> 1816.08]  And because, you know, notice the context of this passage that we read.
[1816.72 --> 1821.22]  When Jesus gives his disciples their mission, they are weak as well.
[1821.22 --> 1831.88]  They're kind of almost, maybe not as weak as in now or in England, you know, 50 years ago.
[1832.06 --> 1834.58]  But the church was very weak in Jesus' time.
[1834.68 --> 1835.88]  Jesus had been crucified.
[1836.88 --> 1839.40]  There were threats on every side.
[1840.08 --> 1843.98]  And you see this in the passage starting in verse 19.
[1843.98 --> 1846.30]  So again, it says,
[1846.50 --> 1849.98]  On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together,
[1850.48 --> 1853.10]  with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders,
[1854.00 --> 1856.32]  Jesus came and stood among them and said,
[1857.00 --> 1858.10]  Peace be with you.
[1859.06 --> 1862.46]  Notice the disciples were hiding out in fear.
[1863.46 --> 1866.12]  And it's in the very midst of their weakness,
[1866.36 --> 1870.10]  it's in the midst of their fear that Jesus speaks peace over them.
[1870.10 --> 1873.36]  And he invites them anew into his mission.
[1874.34 --> 1877.62]  And so my hope for today is that Jesus would speak his peace over us,
[1877.82 --> 1881.06]  and that he would remind us of our mission as the church.
[1881.58 --> 1884.96]  And so today I want to point out three truths that we see from this passage
[1884.96 --> 1886.60]  about the mission of the church.
[1887.22 --> 1889.26]  This is what the three truths are.
[1889.74 --> 1893.06]  That mission flows from the purposes of the Father,
[1893.82 --> 1897.64]  that it follows the pattern of Jesus the Son,
[1897.64 --> 1900.80]  and that it is fueled by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1901.36 --> 1903.10]  Okay, so mission flows from the Father,
[1903.56 --> 1905.28]  it follows the pattern of the Son,
[1905.38 --> 1908.10]  and it is fueled by the Holy Spirit.
[1909.58 --> 1912.48]  And so, actually before we even get to that first point, Andrew,
[1912.98 --> 1915.30]  one of the things I want us to notice first,
[1915.56 --> 1917.48]  one of the remarkable things about these verses,
[1918.24 --> 1922.76]  is that we actually get a glimpse into the very life and purposes of the Trinity.
[1922.76 --> 1923.24]  Right?
[1924.08 --> 1925.76]  So Jesus says, as we read,
[1926.04 --> 1929.26]  that as the Father sent me the Son,
[1929.42 --> 1930.90]  even so I am sending you,
[1931.22 --> 1933.06]  and he breathes on them the Holy Spirit
[1933.06 --> 1935.92]  to empower them for that mission.
[1936.04 --> 1939.12]  So right there we see the Trinity in these verses.
[1939.26 --> 1940.34]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[1941.14 --> 1942.84]  So the first thing I want us to see
[1942.84 --> 1945.34]  is that mission is actually grounded and rooted
[1945.34 --> 1947.26]  in the life of the Triune God.
[1948.10 --> 1948.54]  Right?
[1948.64 --> 1949.74]  And I think that's pretty cool.
[1949.74 --> 1952.96]  So let's keep that in mind on this Trinity Sunday
[1952.96 --> 1954.48]  as we look at this passage.
[1955.86 --> 1958.30]  Okay, so again, what is the mission of the church?
[1958.60 --> 1960.04]  Three things for us this morning.
[1960.22 --> 1962.08]  So first, here's our first point.
[1963.18 --> 1966.56]  Mission flows from the purposes of the Father.
[1967.84 --> 1970.02]  So now let's kind of use our imaginations,
[1970.18 --> 1971.80]  put ourselves back there again
[1971.80 --> 1974.88]  on that evening of Easter morning.
[1977.24 --> 1979.24]  Various people during the day
[1979.24 --> 1981.26]  had been spreading rumors
[1981.26 --> 1983.72]  that they had seen Jesus.
[1984.92 --> 1985.12]  Right?
[1985.18 --> 1986.60]  Even though he had been killed
[1986.60 --> 1988.48]  on the previous Friday.
[1989.24 --> 1991.96]  Now, first century people were not stupid.
[1992.80 --> 1994.16]  They knew, just as we do,
[1994.26 --> 1995.68]  that when something dies,
[1995.78 --> 1997.24]  it stays dead.
[1998.46 --> 2001.20]  So when the Lord appears in that room
[2001.20 --> 2003.62]  without them unlocking the doors,
[2003.76 --> 2006.28]  you can imagine why Jesus would have to say,
[2006.70 --> 2008.46]  peace be with you.
[2009.24 --> 2011.30]  And then he showed them the wounds
[2011.30 --> 2013.86]  of the nails in his wrists,
[2014.06 --> 2017.36]  in the spear wound in his side
[2017.36 --> 2018.20]  from the soldiers,
[2018.72 --> 2021.16]  to show that this was the same Jesus
[2021.16 --> 2023.84]  that was crucified three days earlier,
[2024.10 --> 2025.60]  and who is now alive.
[2026.02 --> 2028.32]  And he was as real and alive
[2028.32 --> 2031.54]  and breathing as ever.
[2031.54 --> 2033.18]  And in a mysterious way,
[2033.18 --> 2034.44]  even more so,
[2034.80 --> 2037.62]  more alive than they had ever known him to be.
[2038.72 --> 2042.16]  And he speaks an important word to them,
[2042.24 --> 2043.68]  a life-changing word.
[2044.64 --> 2047.22]  So again, here we go, verse 21.
[2047.40 --> 2049.20]  This is really the key passage here.
[2050.10 --> 2051.22]  Again, Jesus said,
[2051.76 --> 2052.70]  peace be with you,
[2052.94 --> 2054.76]  as the Father has sent me,
[2055.18 --> 2056.46]  I am sending you.
[2056.46 --> 2059.12]  Now let's pause
[2059.12 --> 2060.88]  and realize
[2060.88 --> 2063.82]  what an amazing sentence this is.
[2064.82 --> 2067.40]  This is the mission.
[2068.56 --> 2069.60]  This is the mission.
[2070.52 --> 2071.86]  As God the Father,
[2072.38 --> 2073.48]  in love,
[2074.02 --> 2075.78]  sent the Son into the world
[2075.78 --> 2076.90]  to save the world,
[2077.60 --> 2078.44]  even so,
[2078.58 --> 2079.18]  Jesus says,
[2079.30 --> 2080.66]  now I am sending you,
[2081.10 --> 2081.72]  my disciples.
[2081.72 --> 2084.28]  So notice,
[2084.54 --> 2085.60]  first and foremost,
[2086.32 --> 2088.20]  that mission doesn't start with us.
[2089.06 --> 2090.08]  It's not as though
[2090.08 --> 2091.10]  the church,
[2091.50 --> 2091.70]  you know,
[2091.74 --> 2092.82]  we kind of come together
[2092.82 --> 2094.66]  and we decide
[2094.66 --> 2096.54]  what is our mission going to be.
[2096.60 --> 2097.58]  We have to figure this out.
[2097.64 --> 2098.26]  What kind of mission
[2098.26 --> 2099.28]  do we want to be on?
[2099.78 --> 2100.76]  That's not the way it is
[2100.76 --> 2102.70]  because it is God's mission,
[2103.00 --> 2104.96]  not our mission.
[2107.02 --> 2108.82]  Another kind of big name
[2108.82 --> 2110.78]  as far as a mission thinker,
[2110.94 --> 2111.62]  a missiologist,
[2111.96 --> 2112.58]  not only do we have
[2112.58 --> 2113.28]  Leslie Newbigin,
[2113.30 --> 2114.28]  we have Christopher Wright.
[2114.94 --> 2116.54]  So in his work,
[2116.92 --> 2118.28]  The Mission of God,
[2118.40 --> 2119.70]  he says this,
[2119.74 --> 2120.16]  this quote,
[2121.22 --> 2123.38]  it is not so much the case
[2123.38 --> 2124.94]  that God has a mission
[2124.94 --> 2126.40]  for his church in the world
[2126.40 --> 2128.20]  as that God has a church
[2128.20 --> 2129.60]  for his mission in the world.
[2130.04 --> 2131.18]  Mission was not made
[2131.18 --> 2132.02]  for the church,
[2132.02 --> 2133.48]  the church was made
[2133.48 --> 2135.02]  for mission,
[2135.90 --> 2137.16]  God's mission.
[2138.80 --> 2139.20]  Right?
[2139.30 --> 2140.34]  So that's like a whole
[2140.34 --> 2142.24]  mind shift we have to make.
[2142.84 --> 2143.56]  In other words,
[2143.66 --> 2144.44]  we exist,
[2144.52 --> 2145.50]  the church exists
[2145.50 --> 2147.36]  for God's mission.
[2148.30 --> 2148.40]  Right?
[2148.48 --> 2149.02]  It's not, you know,
[2149.06 --> 2150.46]  mission isn't some activity
[2150.46 --> 2151.58]  that the church does.
[2152.28 --> 2153.82]  Mission is the very identity
[2153.82 --> 2154.64]  of the church.
[2155.20 --> 2156.36]  And that means so that
[2156.36 --> 2157.70]  we are now an instrument
[2157.70 --> 2159.20]  of bringing about
[2159.20 --> 2159.88]  God's kingdom
[2159.88 --> 2160.82]  and God's peace
[2160.82 --> 2161.78]  in the world.
[2161.96 --> 2163.28]  That's what the church is.
[2164.08 --> 2164.38]  You know,
[2164.42 --> 2165.74]  and sometimes we use this phrase,
[2165.74 --> 2166.66]  we say we are
[2166.66 --> 2167.92]  the hands and feet
[2167.92 --> 2168.50]  of Christ.
[2168.68 --> 2169.62]  We are the heart
[2169.62 --> 2170.74]  of Christ in the world
[2170.74 --> 2172.90]  because God is present
[2172.90 --> 2174.32]  in the world
[2174.32 --> 2176.06]  in and through
[2176.06 --> 2177.68]  his spirit-filled church.
[2178.84 --> 2180.12]  And so at the very best,
[2180.24 --> 2180.80]  the church
[2180.80 --> 2182.48]  is a foretaste
[2182.48 --> 2183.08]  of the kingdom.
[2183.70 --> 2183.92]  Right?
[2183.96 --> 2185.14]  We are a place
[2185.14 --> 2186.40]  where the world
[2186.40 --> 2187.92]  can get a true taste,
[2188.74 --> 2190.34]  a true vision
[2190.34 --> 2191.56]  of God's kingdom
[2191.56 --> 2192.64]  breaking into the world.
[2192.64 --> 2195.22]  But because the mission
[2195.22 --> 2196.06]  is God's,
[2196.06 --> 2197.32]  when we fall short,
[2197.76 --> 2198.60]  when we're not
[2198.60 --> 2199.34]  kind of being
[2199.34 --> 2200.34]  the hands and feet of God,
[2200.42 --> 2200.86]  when we're not being
[2200.86 --> 2201.80]  the heart of God,
[2201.98 --> 2203.40]  when the world sees the church
[2203.40 --> 2204.48]  and it maybe doesn't see
[2204.48 --> 2205.50]  the kingdom in its fullness,
[2206.18 --> 2207.96]  God always invites us
[2207.96 --> 2208.62]  deeper
[2208.62 --> 2212.50]  in a truer way
[2212.50 --> 2213.72]  to express
[2213.72 --> 2214.88]  his kingdom.
[2216.50 --> 2217.04]  You know,
[2217.12 --> 2218.36]  and it's in the gospel
[2218.36 --> 2218.96]  of John
[2218.96 --> 2220.20]  that we're given
[2220.20 --> 2221.10]  such as beautiful
[2221.10 --> 2222.48]  and crystal clear
[2222.48 --> 2223.42]  statement
[2223.42 --> 2224.94]  about how mission
[2224.94 --> 2225.68]  flows
[2225.68 --> 2227.06]  from God.
[2227.68 --> 2228.80]  So these words
[2228.80 --> 2229.48]  are very familiar,
[2229.70 --> 2230.74]  but think about them
[2230.74 --> 2231.70]  through this lens
[2231.70 --> 2233.12]  of mission.
[2233.96 --> 2234.02]  Okay?
[2234.52 --> 2235.10]  For God
[2235.10 --> 2236.00]  so loved
[2236.00 --> 2236.68]  the world
[2236.68 --> 2238.42]  that he gave
[2238.42 --> 2239.56]  his one and only son
[2239.56 --> 2240.68]  that whoever
[2240.68 --> 2241.50]  believes in him
[2241.50 --> 2242.30]  shall not perish
[2242.30 --> 2243.52]  but have eternal life.
[2244.08 --> 2244.82]  For God did not
[2244.82 --> 2245.88]  send his son
[2245.88 --> 2246.58]  into the world
[2246.58 --> 2247.72]  to condemn the world
[2247.72 --> 2248.86]  but to save the world
[2248.86 --> 2249.54]  through him.
[2251.12 --> 2252.28]  And so just notice here
[2252.28 --> 2252.92]  how mission
[2252.92 --> 2254.28]  begins with the heart
[2254.28 --> 2254.82]  and the purposes
[2254.82 --> 2255.30]  of God.
[2255.74 --> 2257.10]  God so loved
[2257.10 --> 2257.52]  the world
[2257.52 --> 2258.86]  that he gave
[2258.86 --> 2259.44]  his son.
[2260.26 --> 2261.18]  And he sent Jesus
[2261.18 --> 2262.16]  not to condemn us
[2262.16 --> 2263.02]  but to save us.
[2263.72 --> 2263.90]  Right?
[2263.96 --> 2265.02]  That's what the mission is.
[2265.10 --> 2265.72]  And it starts
[2265.72 --> 2266.32]  with the heart
[2266.32 --> 2267.06]  of God,
[2267.22 --> 2268.04]  a heart of love
[2268.04 --> 2268.64]  for the world.
[2269.60 --> 2270.40]  And so that's the first thing
[2270.40 --> 2271.24]  we've got to see here
[2271.24 --> 2272.92]  is that mission
[2272.92 --> 2274.38]  begins not with us
[2274.38 --> 2275.04]  but it begins
[2275.04 --> 2275.84]  with God.
[2276.00 --> 2276.86]  God the Father
[2276.86 --> 2278.68]  and his heart
[2278.68 --> 2279.46]  for the world.
[2279.46 --> 2280.38]  And that leads us
[2280.38 --> 2281.32]  then to the second truth
[2281.32 --> 2282.48]  we see from this passage.
[2283.22 --> 2283.74]  That mission
[2283.74 --> 2284.92]  then follows
[2284.92 --> 2285.66]  the pattern
[2285.66 --> 2286.42]  of the son.
[2287.68 --> 2287.92]  Okay?
[2288.02 --> 2288.14]  Right?
[2288.18 --> 2289.06]  We've got the Trinity here.
[2289.20 --> 2289.78]  Mission follows
[2289.78 --> 2290.24]  the pattern
[2290.24 --> 2290.74]  of the son.
[2291.28 --> 2292.38]  And we see this
[2292.38 --> 2293.12]  in verse 21.
[2295.28 --> 2295.80]  You know,
[2295.84 --> 2296.48]  we've read this again
[2296.48 --> 2297.16]  but here it is.
[2297.40 --> 2297.70]  Again,
[2297.82 --> 2298.40]  Jesus said,
[2298.72 --> 2299.46]  peace be with you.
[2299.60 --> 2300.36]  As the Father
[2300.36 --> 2301.08]  has sent me,
[2301.42 --> 2302.84]  I am sending you.
[2303.62 --> 2303.84]  Right?
[2303.92 --> 2304.70]  As the Father
[2304.70 --> 2305.52]  sent Jesus,
[2305.52 --> 2308.38]  in the same way,
[2309.04 --> 2310.70]  Jesus sends you
[2310.70 --> 2311.86]  and me.
[2312.78 --> 2313.58]  That means
[2313.58 --> 2314.12]  our mission
[2314.12 --> 2314.92]  not only flows
[2314.92 --> 2316.04]  from the heart of God
[2316.04 --> 2316.94]  but it also
[2316.94 --> 2317.98]  is an extension
[2317.98 --> 2320.04]  of Jesus' mission.
[2321.30 --> 2322.46]  So how
[2322.46 --> 2322.96]  then
[2322.96 --> 2323.64]  was
[2323.64 --> 2324.58]  Jesus sent
[2324.58 --> 2325.12]  by the Father?
[2325.46 --> 2326.18]  Or what is
[2326.18 --> 2326.78]  the pattern
[2326.78 --> 2328.04]  of Jesus' life
[2328.04 --> 2329.22]  that we are
[2329.22 --> 2329.76]  to follow
[2329.76 --> 2331.08]  as we extend
[2331.08 --> 2331.60]  his mission
[2331.60 --> 2332.24]  into the world?
[2333.70 --> 2334.20]  Well,
[2334.20 --> 2335.20]  Jesus left
[2335.20 --> 2335.72]  his place
[2335.72 --> 2336.22]  of comfort
[2336.22 --> 2337.14]  in heaven
[2337.14 --> 2338.52]  and he came
[2338.52 --> 2339.12]  to be present
[2339.12 --> 2339.68]  with us.
[2340.92 --> 2341.08]  Okay?
[2341.20 --> 2342.06]  Just think about that.
[2342.56 --> 2343.32]  Jesus left
[2343.32 --> 2344.04]  his place
[2344.04 --> 2344.48]  of comfort
[2344.48 --> 2344.94]  in heaven
[2344.94 --> 2345.94]  and he came
[2345.94 --> 2346.82]  to be with us.
[2347.28 --> 2347.50]  Right?
[2347.56 --> 2348.10]  And so his
[2348.10 --> 2349.26]  mission was
[2349.26 --> 2349.58]  a mission
[2349.58 --> 2350.34]  of presence
[2350.34 --> 2351.66]  not distance.
[2352.16 --> 2352.70]  God did not
[2352.70 --> 2353.20]  send us
[2353.20 --> 2353.66]  his thoughts
[2353.66 --> 2354.14]  and prayers.
[2354.64 --> 2355.64]  God sent us
[2355.64 --> 2356.44]  his son.
[2357.70 --> 2357.88]  You know,
[2357.98 --> 2358.64]  in John,
[2358.80 --> 2359.40]  the same gospel
[2359.40 --> 2359.92]  tells us
[2359.92 --> 2360.60]  right in the beginning
[2360.60 --> 2361.92]  Jesus became
[2361.92 --> 2362.50]  flesh
[2362.50 --> 2363.64]  and he dwelt
[2363.64 --> 2364.34]  among us.
[2365.22 --> 2365.44]  Right?
[2366.04 --> 2366.76]  So Jesus
[2366.76 --> 2367.32]  came to be
[2367.32 --> 2367.72]  with us
[2367.72 --> 2368.00]  and that's
[2368.00 --> 2368.60]  why even
[2368.60 --> 2368.94]  today
[2368.94 --> 2369.44]  we still
[2369.44 --> 2370.52]  send missionaries
[2370.52 --> 2371.48]  all over
[2371.48 --> 2371.98]  the world.
[2372.52 --> 2373.18]  Because when
[2373.18 --> 2373.76]  God decided
[2373.76 --> 2374.38]  to save us
[2374.38 --> 2374.66]  he didn't
[2374.66 --> 2375.08]  just write
[2375.08 --> 2375.56]  a check.
[2376.56 --> 2377.92]  He sent
[2377.92 --> 2378.68]  his son.
[2378.76 --> 2379.22]  He came
[2379.22 --> 2379.48]  to be
[2379.48 --> 2379.98]  with us.
[2380.78 --> 2381.40]  And following
[2381.40 --> 2381.92]  this same
[2381.92 --> 2382.82]  pattern then
[2382.82 --> 2383.44]  Christians
[2383.44 --> 2384.20]  leave their
[2384.20 --> 2384.72]  places of
[2384.72 --> 2385.02]  comfort
[2385.02 --> 2385.72]  to go
[2385.72 --> 2386.08]  to be
[2386.08 --> 2386.66]  with people.
[2386.92 --> 2387.22]  To be
[2387.22 --> 2387.50]  present
[2387.50 --> 2387.98]  with people.
[2389.00 --> 2389.50]  And Jesus
[2389.50 --> 2389.76]  you know
[2389.76 --> 2390.44]  he was present
[2390.44 --> 2391.10]  with every
[2391.10 --> 2391.62]  kind of
[2391.62 --> 2391.96]  person.
[2392.54 --> 2393.16]  He was
[2393.16 --> 2393.58]  present
[2393.58 --> 2394.00]  with
[2394.00 --> 2394.66]  slaves
[2394.66 --> 2395.30]  and
[2395.30 --> 2395.64]  slave
[2395.64 --> 2396.02]  owners.
[2396.66 --> 2397.34]  To the
[2397.34 --> 2397.80]  religious
[2397.80 --> 2398.48]  and those
[2398.48 --> 2398.78]  who had
[2398.78 --> 2399.22]  given up
[2399.22 --> 2399.74]  on religion.
[2400.70 --> 2401.04]  He was
[2401.04 --> 2401.38]  present
[2401.38 --> 2402.24]  to people
[2402.24 --> 2402.54]  who were
[2402.54 --> 2403.02]  beautiful
[2403.02 --> 2403.94]  and to
[2403.94 --> 2404.14]  the
[2404.14 --> 2404.40]  lepers.
[2405.02 --> 2405.48]  He was
[2405.48 --> 2405.76]  present
[2405.76 --> 2406.10]  with the
[2406.10 --> 2406.56]  kind
[2406.56 --> 2407.14]  and generous
[2407.14 --> 2407.74]  and with
[2407.74 --> 2408.40]  the mean.
[2409.92 --> 2410.42]  And Jesus
[2410.42 --> 2411.12]  was present
[2411.12 --> 2411.70]  also in
[2411.70 --> 2412.24]  all kinds
[2412.24 --> 2412.86]  of situations.
[2413.90 --> 2414.50]  He entered
[2414.50 --> 2415.20]  into a world
[2415.20 --> 2415.78]  that was so
[2415.78 --> 2416.26]  much like
[2416.26 --> 2416.70]  our own.
[2416.76 --> 2417.08]  A world
[2417.08 --> 2417.76]  of confusion
[2417.76 --> 2418.82]  and violence
[2418.82 --> 2419.44]  and greed
[2419.44 --> 2420.02]  and sickness
[2420.02 --> 2421.12]  and injustice
[2421.12 --> 2422.26]  and terrible
[2422.26 --> 2422.76]  religious
[2422.76 --> 2423.46]  hypocrisy
[2423.46 --> 2424.56]  and he
[2424.56 --> 2424.90]  entered
[2424.90 --> 2425.66]  into the
[2425.66 --> 2426.64]  real world
[2426.64 --> 2427.14]  that we
[2427.14 --> 2427.50]  live in
[2427.50 --> 2428.02]  with all
[2428.02 --> 2428.28]  of its
[2428.28 --> 2428.70]  messiness.
[2430.20 --> 2431.22]  He left
[2431.22 --> 2431.62]  his place
[2431.62 --> 2432.14]  of comfort
[2432.14 --> 2433.12]  and he
[2433.12 --> 2433.64]  came to
[2433.64 --> 2434.04]  be with
[2434.04 --> 2434.38]  us.
[2435.18 --> 2435.64]  And so
[2435.64 --> 2436.54]  our pattern
[2436.54 --> 2437.12]  for mission
[2437.12 --> 2438.36]  is the
[2438.36 --> 2438.66]  same.
[2439.42 --> 2439.86]  We are
[2439.86 --> 2440.32]  sent in
[2440.32 --> 2440.66]  the same
[2440.66 --> 2440.86]  way.
[2440.96 --> 2441.18]  We are
[2441.18 --> 2441.40]  to be
[2441.40 --> 2441.80]  present
[2441.80 --> 2442.62]  with every
[2442.62 --> 2443.02]  kind of
[2443.02 --> 2443.42]  person,
[2443.92 --> 2444.58]  the likable,
[2444.86 --> 2445.02]  the
[2445.02 --> 2445.68]  unlikable,
[2446.04 --> 2446.74]  and in
[2446.74 --> 2447.24]  every kind
[2447.24 --> 2447.88]  of situation.
[2448.38 --> 2448.92]  In the
[2448.92 --> 2449.42]  hospitals,
[2450.14 --> 2451.04]  in schools,
[2451.66 --> 2452.32]  across the
[2452.32 --> 2452.68]  street with
[2452.68 --> 2453.20]  our neighbors
[2453.20 --> 2454.38]  who may
[2454.38 --> 2454.80]  not like
[2454.80 --> 2455.18]  us or
[2455.18 --> 2455.62]  like what
[2455.62 --> 2456.18]  we believe.
[2457.96 --> 2458.78]  And please
[2458.78 --> 2459.32]  know that
[2459.32 --> 2459.86]  for us to
[2459.86 --> 2460.24]  be sent
[2460.24 --> 2460.74]  on mission,
[2461.50 --> 2462.22]  it doesn't
[2462.22 --> 2462.56]  mean that
[2462.56 --> 2462.88]  we all
[2462.88 --> 2463.16]  need to
[2463.16 --> 2463.54]  move
[2463.54 --> 2464.54]  geographically,
[2464.66 --> 2465.88]  but we
[2465.88 --> 2466.26]  are still
[2466.26 --> 2466.70]  sent in
[2466.70 --> 2467.10]  the same
[2467.10 --> 2467.46]  way,
[2467.90 --> 2468.20]  the same
[2468.20 --> 2468.70]  pattern.
[2468.96 --> 2469.48]  We leave
[2469.48 --> 2469.84]  our place
[2469.84 --> 2470.36]  of comfort
[2470.36 --> 2471.20]  in order
[2471.20 --> 2471.50]  to be
[2471.50 --> 2471.82]  present
[2471.82 --> 2472.38]  with others.
[2473.78 --> 2474.08]  And this
[2474.08 --> 2474.50]  is why
[2474.50 --> 2475.18]  most of
[2475.18 --> 2475.84]  our life
[2475.84 --> 2476.50]  on mission
[2476.50 --> 2476.92]  as a
[2476.92 --> 2477.30]  church
[2477.30 --> 2478.50]  isn't so
[2478.50 --> 2478.98]  much about
[2478.98 --> 2479.52]  our ministry
[2479.52 --> 2480.06]  programs,
[2480.14 --> 2480.34]  it's not
[2480.34 --> 2480.70]  about what
[2480.70 --> 2481.46]  we do
[2481.46 --> 2481.94]  during the
[2481.94 --> 2482.34]  week so
[2482.34 --> 2482.58]  much,
[2482.60 --> 2483.04]  as it
[2483.04 --> 2483.62]  is the
[2483.62 --> 2483.98]  everyday
[2483.98 --> 2484.80]  lives of
[2484.80 --> 2486.06]  you out
[2486.06 --> 2486.40]  in the
[2486.40 --> 2486.74]  world,
[2487.34 --> 2487.78]  in the
[2487.78 --> 2488.32]  classroom,
[2489.00 --> 2489.72]  as students,
[2490.10 --> 2490.56]  in the
[2490.56 --> 2491.00]  conference
[2491.00 --> 2491.38]  room,
[2492.06 --> 2492.60]  in the
[2492.60 --> 2492.92]  kitchen,
[2493.06 --> 2493.26]  wherever
[2493.26 --> 2494.12]  you go,
[2494.24 --> 2494.78]  that is
[2494.78 --> 2495.26]  the mission
[2495.26 --> 2495.80]  of God
[2495.80 --> 2496.50]  happening
[2496.50 --> 2496.98]  in the
[2496.98 --> 2497.24]  world.
[2498.60 --> 2499.00]  And so,
[2499.18 --> 2500.14]  no Christian
[2500.14 --> 2500.82]  ever needs
[2500.82 --> 2501.30]  to say,
[2501.46 --> 2501.58]  oh,
[2501.66 --> 2502.24]  I wish
[2502.24 --> 2503.16]  I was
[2503.16 --> 2503.72]  a missionary,
[2503.72 --> 2505.84]  because you
[2505.84 --> 2506.64]  already are.
[2507.60 --> 2508.26]  The gift
[2508.26 --> 2508.96]  is yours,
[2509.10 --> 2509.76]  the calling
[2509.76 --> 2511.00]  belongs to
[2511.00 --> 2511.58]  all of us.
[2512.92 --> 2513.36]  Some of
[2513.36 --> 2513.64]  us,
[2513.72 --> 2514.18]  like Hannah,
[2514.28 --> 2514.58]  did I say
[2514.58 --> 2514.88]  Hannah?
[2515.28 --> 2515.66]  That is
[2515.66 --> 2515.82]  you,
[2515.88 --> 2516.02]  right?
[2516.36 --> 2516.78]  Some of
[2516.78 --> 2516.92]  us,
[2517.00 --> 2517.46]  like Hannah,
[2517.68 --> 2521.14]  go across
[2521.14 --> 2521.68]  the world,
[2522.00 --> 2522.60]  right,
[2522.66 --> 2523.96]  to minister
[2523.96 --> 2524.64]  to refugees
[2524.64 --> 2525.20]  in Greece.
[2526.48 --> 2526.96]  That's
[2526.96 --> 2527.24]  part of
[2527.24 --> 2527.66]  the mission.
[2528.46 --> 2528.90]  The rest
[2528.90 --> 2529.44]  of us,
[2530.32 --> 2530.66]  what it
[2530.66 --> 2531.06]  looks like
[2531.06 --> 2531.38]  for us
[2531.38 --> 2531.76]  to be
[2531.76 --> 2532.44]  the presence
[2532.44 --> 2532.96]  of God
[2532.96 --> 2533.28]  is to
[2533.28 --> 2533.70]  go wherever
[2533.70 --> 2534.42]  we live
[2534.42 --> 2535.18]  to be
[2535.18 --> 2535.62]  in whatever
[2535.62 --> 2536.24]  situation
[2536.24 --> 2536.70]  we are
[2536.70 --> 2537.02]  in.
[2538.12 --> 2538.60]  So,
[2538.70 --> 2539.50]  it's both,
[2539.62 --> 2539.82]  right?
[2540.30 --> 2540.96]  And that's
[2540.96 --> 2541.70]  one way
[2541.70 --> 2542.00]  that we
[2542.00 --> 2542.50]  follow this
[2542.50 --> 2543.10]  pattern of
[2543.10 --> 2543.38]  Jesus.
[2543.54 --> 2543.80]  It's the
[2543.80 --> 2544.78]  pattern of
[2544.78 --> 2545.24]  presence.
[2545.64 --> 2546.00]  We go to
[2546.00 --> 2546.42]  be with
[2546.42 --> 2546.76]  people.
[2547.74 --> 2548.10]  Now,
[2548.18 --> 2548.36]  there's
[2548.36 --> 2548.66]  another
[2548.66 --> 2549.24]  pattern I
[2549.24 --> 2549.50]  want to
[2549.50 --> 2549.80]  mention,
[2549.96 --> 2550.24]  and we
[2550.24 --> 2550.80]  see this
[2550.80 --> 2551.06]  in the
[2551.06 --> 2551.46]  way that
[2551.46 --> 2551.74]  Jesus
[2551.74 --> 2552.44]  was sent
[2552.44 --> 2552.74]  by the
[2552.74 --> 2553.04]  Father.
[2553.56 --> 2553.96]  He was
[2553.96 --> 2554.52]  sent,
[2555.10 --> 2555.50]  and he
[2555.50 --> 2555.94]  lived his
[2555.94 --> 2556.44]  life and
[2556.44 --> 2556.70]  did his
[2556.70 --> 2557.20]  ministry,
[2557.72 --> 2558.16]  both in
[2558.16 --> 2558.76]  word and
[2558.76 --> 2559.14]  in deed.
[2559.90 --> 2560.10]  Okay?
[2560.42 --> 2561.02]  A pattern
[2561.02 --> 2561.68]  of word
[2561.68 --> 2562.48]  and deed.
[2562.78 --> 2563.20]  We see
[2563.20 --> 2563.56]  this all
[2563.56 --> 2563.70]  through
[2563.70 --> 2563.96]  Jesus'
[2564.18 --> 2564.40]  life.
[2564.52 --> 2564.80]  Jesus
[2564.80 --> 2565.22]  comes,
[2565.60 --> 2566.14]  he feeds
[2566.14 --> 2566.70]  5,000
[2566.70 --> 2567.12]  people,
[2567.30 --> 2567.98]  he meets
[2567.98 --> 2568.36]  their needs
[2568.36 --> 2568.80]  of hunger,
[2569.48 --> 2569.86]  and then
[2569.86 --> 2570.26]  he says,
[2570.36 --> 2570.84]  I am the
[2570.84 --> 2571.16]  bread of
[2571.16 --> 2571.48]  life.
[2572.00 --> 2572.42]  All who
[2572.42 --> 2572.80]  come to
[2572.80 --> 2573.10]  me will
[2573.10 --> 2573.32]  never
[2573.32 --> 2573.68]  hunger.
[2575.04 --> 2575.90]  And he
[2575.90 --> 2576.20]  says,
[2576.28 --> 2576.86]  I am the
[2576.86 --> 2577.26]  light of
[2577.26 --> 2577.70]  the world,
[2577.78 --> 2578.16]  and then he
[2578.16 --> 2578.50]  goes and
[2578.50 --> 2579.12]  heals someone
[2579.12 --> 2579.44]  of their
[2579.44 --> 2579.78]  blindness.
[2580.92 --> 2581.80]  So it's
[2581.80 --> 2582.38]  teaching,
[2582.84 --> 2583.52]  it's preaching
[2583.52 --> 2584.06]  the gospel,
[2584.30 --> 2584.92]  and it is
[2584.92 --> 2585.50]  care for
[2585.50 --> 2585.94]  people,
[2586.18 --> 2586.46]  and they
[2586.46 --> 2587.10]  go together,
[2587.48 --> 2588.68]  word and
[2588.68 --> 2588.98]  deed.
[2588.98 --> 2590.44]  I heard
[2590.44 --> 2590.60]  this
[2590.60 --> 2590.96]  illustration
[2590.96 --> 2591.52]  once about
[2591.52 --> 2591.84]  it kind
[2591.84 --> 2592.06]  of like
[2592.06 --> 2592.52]  being a
[2592.52 --> 2592.80]  pair of
[2592.80 --> 2593.04]  scissors,
[2593.20 --> 2593.38]  right?
[2593.84 --> 2594.48]  Scissors have
[2594.48 --> 2595.18]  two blades,
[2596.48 --> 2597.20]  and if you
[2597.20 --> 2597.42]  only have
[2597.42 --> 2598.02]  one blade,
[2598.34 --> 2598.64]  it's not
[2598.64 --> 2599.26]  really scissors
[2599.26 --> 2599.50]  anymore.
[2599.58 --> 2599.80]  You can do
[2599.80 --> 2600.22]  some stuff
[2600.22 --> 2600.48]  with it,
[2600.54 --> 2600.80]  but it's
[2600.80 --> 2601.22]  not scissors.
[2601.38 --> 2602.38]  So you
[2602.38 --> 2604.02]  need both
[2604.02 --> 2604.36]  blades,
[2604.42 --> 2604.64]  you need
[2604.64 --> 2605.10]  the word,
[2605.22 --> 2605.80]  the proclamation
[2605.80 --> 2606.10]  of the
[2606.10 --> 2606.32]  gospel,
[2606.32 --> 2606.96]  and you
[2606.96 --> 2607.90]  need words
[2607.90 --> 2609.08]  of care
[2609.08 --> 2609.64]  for people,
[2609.84 --> 2610.62]  and together
[2610.62 --> 2611.82]  that is the
[2611.82 --> 2612.08]  way the
[2612.08 --> 2612.86]  gospel works.
[2612.86 --> 2616.40]  And just
[2616.40 --> 2616.96]  as the
[2616.96 --> 2617.58]  Father sent
[2617.58 --> 2618.18]  Jesus in
[2618.18 --> 2618.60]  word and
[2618.60 --> 2619.00]  deed into
[2619.00 --> 2619.52]  the world,
[2619.82 --> 2620.42]  in the same
[2620.42 --> 2620.72]  way he
[2620.72 --> 2621.28]  sends us
[2621.28 --> 2621.68]  as his
[2621.68 --> 2622.78]  people in
[2622.78 --> 2623.30]  word and
[2623.30 --> 2624.16]  in deed into
[2624.16 --> 2624.72]  the world.
[2625.58 --> 2626.50]  And as we
[2626.50 --> 2626.94]  look at this
[2626.94 --> 2627.34]  passage,
[2627.46 --> 2627.60]  though,
[2627.68 --> 2628.18]  it's really
[2628.18 --> 2628.62]  there's an
[2628.62 --> 2629.46]  emphasis on
[2629.46 --> 2629.96]  which one?
[2631.18 --> 2631.86]  There's an
[2631.86 --> 2632.62]  emphasis on
[2632.62 --> 2632.96]  word.
[2633.44 --> 2633.72]  Okay, so
[2633.72 --> 2634.30]  notice in
[2634.30 --> 2635.10]  verse 23,
[2636.54 --> 2637.06]  if you
[2637.06 --> 2638.50]  forgive anyone's
[2638.50 --> 2639.12]  sins, their
[2639.12 --> 2639.56]  sins are
[2639.56 --> 2639.94]  forgiven.
[2640.36 --> 2640.94]  If you do
[2640.94 --> 2641.50]  not forgive
[2641.50 --> 2642.34]  them, they
[2642.34 --> 2642.80]  are not
[2642.80 --> 2643.20]  forgiven.
[2644.56 --> 2645.12]  So there's
[2645.12 --> 2645.72]  this emphasis
[2645.72 --> 2646.66]  not only on
[2646.66 --> 2647.46]  peace, right?
[2647.54 --> 2648.04]  Jesus comes
[2648.04 --> 2648.32]  and says,
[2648.64 --> 2649.12]  peace be
[2649.12 --> 2649.74]  with you,
[2650.06 --> 2650.88]  but also
[2650.88 --> 2651.42]  this emphasis
[2651.42 --> 2652.04]  on forgiveness
[2652.04 --> 2652.74]  of sins.
[2653.60 --> 2654.24]  So now,
[2654.50 --> 2654.90]  here's the
[2654.90 --> 2655.20]  question,
[2655.40 --> 2655.74]  why?
[2655.94 --> 2656.78]  Why does
[2656.78 --> 2657.58]  Jesus focus
[2657.58 --> 2658.20]  his mission
[2658.20 --> 2658.82]  on the
[2658.82 --> 2659.16]  forgiveness
[2659.16 --> 2659.84]  of sins?
[2660.72 --> 2661.12]  I mean,
[2661.26 --> 2661.72]  you think
[2661.72 --> 2662.22]  about all
[2662.22 --> 2662.80]  the problems
[2662.80 --> 2663.10]  in the
[2663.10 --> 2664.76]  world, right?
[2664.84 --> 2665.18]  There's
[2665.18 --> 2665.66]  poverty,
[2666.18 --> 2666.42]  there's
[2666.42 --> 2667.02]  addiction,
[2667.70 --> 2668.12]  there's
[2668.12 --> 2668.70]  depression,
[2669.08 --> 2669.30]  there's
[2669.30 --> 2669.82]  abuse,
[2669.96 --> 2670.14]  there's
[2670.14 --> 2670.52]  war,
[2670.70 --> 2670.96]  there's
[2670.96 --> 2671.68]  oppression.
[2672.80 --> 2673.66]  Why
[2673.66 --> 2674.26]  doesn't
[2674.26 --> 2674.68]  he make
[2674.68 --> 2675.08]  the most
[2675.08 --> 2675.62]  important
[2675.62 --> 2676.36]  thing
[2676.36 --> 2677.58]  feeding
[2677.58 --> 2678.56]  people
[2678.56 --> 2678.92]  who need
[2678.92 --> 2679.18]  food?
[2680.54 --> 2681.18]  Or
[2681.18 --> 2681.52]  making
[2681.52 --> 2682.08]  hospitals
[2682.08 --> 2682.64]  for people
[2682.64 --> 2682.90]  who are
[2682.90 --> 2683.26]  suffering?
[2683.82 --> 2684.14]  Or
[2684.14 --> 2684.56]  counseling
[2684.56 --> 2685.02]  centers
[2685.02 --> 2685.44]  for the
[2685.44 --> 2685.74]  addicted?
[2686.26 --> 2686.70]  Or
[2686.70 --> 2687.04]  bringing
[2687.04 --> 2687.40]  great
[2687.40 --> 2688.12]  education
[2688.12 --> 2688.56]  to
[2688.56 --> 2689.58]  underprivileged
[2689.58 --> 2690.40]  communities?
[2691.58 --> 2691.72]  Right?
[2692.02 --> 2693.04]  Jesus does
[2693.04 --> 2693.60]  want us
[2693.60 --> 2693.96]  to do
[2693.96 --> 2694.44]  all those
[2694.44 --> 2694.80]  things,
[2694.96 --> 2695.44]  but they
[2695.44 --> 2695.74]  aren't
[2695.74 --> 2696.38]  the main
[2696.38 --> 2697.16]  issue
[2697.16 --> 2697.52]  here.
[2697.52 --> 2698.14]  Why
[2698.14 --> 2698.38]  does
[2698.38 --> 2698.70]  Jesus
[2698.70 --> 2698.98]  put
[2698.98 --> 2699.36]  at the
[2699.36 --> 2699.64]  center
[2699.64 --> 2699.82]  of
[2699.82 --> 2699.94]  the
[2699.94 --> 2700.18]  mission
[2700.18 --> 2700.38]  the
[2700.38 --> 2700.74]  offer
[2700.74 --> 2701.50]  of
[2701.50 --> 2701.96]  having
[2701.96 --> 2702.24]  our
[2702.24 --> 2702.52]  sins
[2702.52 --> 2702.96]  forgiven?
[2704.80 --> 2705.40]  The
[2705.40 --> 2705.78]  answer
[2705.78 --> 2706.26]  is
[2706.26 --> 2706.58]  because
[2706.58 --> 2706.82]  the
[2706.82 --> 2707.34]  forgiveness
[2707.34 --> 2708.16]  offered
[2708.16 --> 2708.54]  to us
[2708.54 --> 2708.76]  in the
[2708.76 --> 2709.10]  gospel
[2709.10 --> 2709.82]  gets
[2709.82 --> 2710.28]  to the
[2710.28 --> 2710.70]  very
[2710.70 --> 2711.54]  core
[2711.54 --> 2712.56]  of
[2712.56 --> 2712.82]  human
[2712.82 --> 2713.44]  existence,
[2714.12 --> 2714.76]  of our
[2714.76 --> 2715.38]  condition.
[2716.42 --> 2716.66]  And so
[2716.66 --> 2717.16]  think about
[2717.16 --> 2717.44]  it like
[2717.44 --> 2717.62]  this.
[2717.68 --> 2717.80]  Think
[2717.80 --> 2718.12]  about the
[2718.12 --> 2718.52]  way a
[2718.52 --> 2718.80]  doctor
[2718.80 --> 2719.28]  works.
[2719.88 --> 2720.24]  Doctors
[2720.24 --> 2720.58]  know
[2720.58 --> 2720.80]  that
[2720.80 --> 2720.98]  it's
[2720.98 --> 2721.58]  extremely
[2721.58 --> 2722.12]  important
[2722.12 --> 2722.38]  to
[2722.38 --> 2723.20]  distinguish
[2723.20 --> 2724.38]  between
[2724.38 --> 2724.98]  treating
[2724.98 --> 2725.52]  the
[2725.52 --> 2726.06]  symptoms
[2726.06 --> 2727.12]  and
[2727.12 --> 2728.02]  diagnosing
[2728.02 --> 2728.26]  the
[2728.26 --> 2728.70]  disease.
[2729.66 --> 2730.26]  So if
[2730.26 --> 2730.70]  you have
[2730.70 --> 2731.24]  a person
[2731.24 --> 2731.94]  with a
[2731.94 --> 2732.32]  severe
[2732.32 --> 2732.84]  headache
[2732.84 --> 2733.68]  and you
[2733.68 --> 2734.16]  give them
[2734.16 --> 2735.12]  pain relief
[2735.12 --> 2735.78]  and the
[2735.78 --> 2736.18]  pain goes
[2736.18 --> 2736.64]  away but
[2736.64 --> 2737.04]  it turns
[2737.04 --> 2737.42]  out they
[2737.42 --> 2738.10]  have a
[2738.10 --> 2738.36]  brain
[2738.36 --> 2738.70]  tumor
[2738.70 --> 2740.74]  and it's
[2740.74 --> 2741.22]  continuing
[2741.22 --> 2741.94]  to grow
[2741.94 --> 2742.28]  and no
[2742.28 --> 2742.72]  one knows
[2742.72 --> 2743.26]  about it,
[2743.54 --> 2744.04]  you're not
[2744.04 --> 2744.76]  helping that
[2744.76 --> 2745.22]  person.
[2746.32 --> 2746.40]  Right?
[2746.46 --> 2746.84]  And so you
[2746.84 --> 2747.18]  need to
[2747.18 --> 2747.88]  diagnose the
[2747.88 --> 2748.46]  disease,
[2748.84 --> 2749.54]  the underlying
[2749.54 --> 2750.36]  problem.
[2751.12 --> 2751.58]  And it's
[2751.58 --> 2752.38]  possible that
[2752.38 --> 2752.88]  all of
[2752.88 --> 2753.22]  these
[2753.22 --> 2754.10]  issues
[2754.10 --> 2754.74]  that we
[2754.74 --> 2755.32]  see,
[2756.06 --> 2756.22]  right,
[2756.32 --> 2756.76]  hunger,
[2757.30 --> 2757.58]  broken
[2757.58 --> 2758.02]  homes,
[2758.38 --> 2758.78]  poverty,
[2759.04 --> 2759.46]  oppression,
[2759.70 --> 2760.02]  addiction,
[2760.26 --> 2760.78]  isolation,
[2761.84 --> 2762.16]  is it
[2762.16 --> 2762.72]  possible that
[2762.72 --> 2763.02]  they are
[2763.02 --> 2764.76]  symptoms but
[2764.76 --> 2765.10]  not the
[2765.10 --> 2765.64]  actual
[2765.64 --> 2766.50]  disease?
[2768.02 --> 2768.88]  Jesus is
[2768.88 --> 2769.32]  saying here
[2769.32 --> 2769.92]  the real
[2769.92 --> 2771.96]  disease is
[2771.96 --> 2773.14]  our sin
[2773.14 --> 2774.08]  has separated
[2774.08 --> 2774.46]  us from
[2774.46 --> 2774.78]  God.
[2775.72 --> 2775.94]  Right?
[2776.02 --> 2776.72]  And forgiveness
[2776.72 --> 2778.54]  deals with
[2778.54 --> 2779.14]  the root
[2779.14 --> 2780.64]  problem because
[2780.64 --> 2781.56]  it reconciles
[2781.56 --> 2781.90]  us back
[2781.90 --> 2782.34]  with God.
[2782.34 --> 2783.06]  And we
[2783.06 --> 2783.72]  become people
[2783.72 --> 2784.12]  then who
[2784.12 --> 2784.38]  have been
[2784.38 --> 2785.36]  welcomed and
[2785.36 --> 2786.14]  embraced by
[2786.14 --> 2787.42]  God and
[2787.42 --> 2787.80]  we've been
[2787.80 --> 2788.46]  adopted into
[2788.46 --> 2789.00]  his family.
[2790.58 --> 2790.82]  And so
[2790.82 --> 2791.76]  verse 23
[2791.76 --> 2792.58]  doesn't mean
[2792.58 --> 2793.06]  that we
[2793.06 --> 2793.62]  have the
[2793.62 --> 2794.10]  power to
[2794.10 --> 2794.78]  forgive people.
[2795.66 --> 2795.74]  Right?
[2795.86 --> 2796.82]  Jesus alone
[2796.82 --> 2797.72]  forgives but
[2797.72 --> 2798.24]  he has given
[2798.24 --> 2799.20]  us authority
[2799.20 --> 2800.44]  to announce
[2800.44 --> 2801.32]  the forgiveness
[2801.32 --> 2802.22]  of sins
[2802.22 --> 2803.68]  to the world
[2803.68 --> 2804.68]  that is offered
[2804.68 --> 2805.30]  through faith in
[2805.30 --> 2805.96]  Jesus Christ.
[2806.68 --> 2807.56]  So the gospel
[2807.56 --> 2808.34]  gets to the
[2808.34 --> 2808.84]  root of the
[2808.84 --> 2809.50]  human condition
[2809.50 --> 2809.60]  salvation.
[2810.00 --> 2810.76]  But that
[2810.76 --> 2811.52]  doesn't mean
[2811.52 --> 2812.56]  that telling
[2812.56 --> 2813.10]  people about
[2813.10 --> 2813.90]  Jesus is the
[2813.90 --> 2814.62]  only thing we
[2814.62 --> 2814.90]  do.
[2816.08 --> 2816.20]  Right?
[2816.36 --> 2817.48]  Jesus is the
[2817.48 --> 2818.84]  only cure for
[2818.84 --> 2819.52]  the disease of
[2819.52 --> 2819.84]  sin.
[2820.68 --> 2821.54]  But if we go
[2821.54 --> 2822.12]  back to the
[2822.12 --> 2822.92]  doctor's analogy
[2822.92 --> 2823.70]  a doctor needs
[2823.70 --> 2824.20]  to make sure
[2824.20 --> 2824.88]  they're treating
[2824.88 --> 2825.62]  the disease
[2825.62 --> 2826.62]  but that doesn't
[2826.62 --> 2827.00]  mean they don't
[2827.00 --> 2827.36]  treat the
[2827.36 --> 2828.12]  symptoms as well.
[2828.12 --> 2828.38]  Right?
[2829.22 --> 2829.46]  Right?
[2829.54 --> 2830.12]  If you have
[2830.12 --> 2830.84]  someone who is
[2830.84 --> 2831.36]  suffering
[2831.36 --> 2832.88]  you want to
[2832.88 --> 2833.50]  find out what
[2833.50 --> 2834.22]  the underlying
[2834.22 --> 2835.12]  problem is
[2835.12 --> 2836.06]  but it would
[2836.06 --> 2837.18]  be cruel to
[2837.18 --> 2837.78]  just leave
[2837.78 --> 2838.22]  them in
[2838.22 --> 2838.78]  their pain
[2838.78 --> 2839.60]  if you had
[2839.60 --> 2840.02]  a way of
[2840.02 --> 2840.54]  relieving their
[2840.54 --> 2840.88]  suffering.
[2842.10 --> 2842.90]  And so we
[2842.90 --> 2843.54]  deal with the
[2843.54 --> 2845.06]  disease and we
[2845.06 --> 2845.72]  try to relieve
[2845.72 --> 2846.44]  the symptoms at
[2846.44 --> 2847.10]  the same time.
[2847.88 --> 2848.50]  And so the
[2848.50 --> 2849.12]  church as the
[2849.12 --> 2849.96]  body of Christ
[2849.96 --> 2851.14]  we are extending
[2851.14 --> 2852.84]  the mission of
[2852.84 --> 2854.50]  Jesus into the
[2854.50 --> 2855.14]  world the way
[2855.14 --> 2857.10]  he did by
[2857.10 --> 2858.40]  extending that
[2858.40 --> 2858.92]  welcome and
[2858.92 --> 2859.56]  embrace that we
[2859.56 --> 2861.12]  have received by
[2861.12 --> 2861.78]  preaching the
[2861.78 --> 2862.42]  gospel getting to
[2862.42 --> 2862.88]  the root of the
[2862.88 --> 2864.14]  problem reconciling
[2864.14 --> 2864.88]  people to God
[2864.88 --> 2865.56]  through Christ
[2865.56 --> 2866.88]  and then in
[2866.88 --> 2867.70]  deeds of mercy
[2867.70 --> 2868.66]  relieving the
[2868.66 --> 2869.20]  suffering of the
[2869.20 --> 2869.48]  world.
[2870.92 --> 2871.70]  That's just what
[2871.70 --> 2872.06]  he did.
[2873.44 --> 2874.60]  And to do
[2874.60 --> 2875.66]  this work
[2875.66 --> 2876.40]  that Jesus
[2876.40 --> 2878.64]  did we need
[2878.64 --> 2879.42]  this third
[2879.42 --> 2880.28]  thing that we
[2880.28 --> 2881.02]  see here.
[2881.12 --> 2881.54]  We need this
[2881.54 --> 2883.30]  we need the
[2883.30 --> 2883.82]  power of the
[2883.82 --> 2884.26]  Holy Spirit.
[2884.44 --> 2884.84]  So that's the
[2884.84 --> 2885.54]  third part here.
[2886.46 --> 2887.70]  Mission is
[2887.70 --> 2889.12]  fueled by the
[2889.12 --> 2889.60]  power of the
[2889.60 --> 2890.08]  Holy Spirit.
[2890.98 --> 2891.64]  Okay so we've
[2891.64 --> 2892.30]  seen that mission
[2892.30 --> 2893.50]  it's not our
[2893.50 --> 2894.34]  mission it flows
[2894.34 --> 2894.86]  from the very
[2894.86 --> 2895.68]  heart and purposes
[2895.68 --> 2896.36]  of God to
[2896.36 --> 2897.02]  save the world.
[2897.38 --> 2898.26]  God sent his
[2898.26 --> 2900.26]  son and then
[2900.26 --> 2901.30]  Jesus says in the
[2901.30 --> 2901.74]  same way I'm
[2901.74 --> 2902.60]  sending you we
[2902.60 --> 2903.54]  extend the mission
[2903.54 --> 2904.40]  of Jesus and word
[2904.40 --> 2905.18]  and deed and being
[2905.18 --> 2909.04]  present then it's
[2909.04 --> 2910.10]  fueled by the
[2910.10 --> 2910.86]  power of the Holy
[2910.86 --> 2911.20]  Spirit.
[2912.04 --> 2912.60]  Right the Holy
[2912.60 --> 2913.32]  Spirit God
[2913.32 --> 2914.90]  himself is the
[2914.90 --> 2916.56]  life blood of the
[2916.56 --> 2917.00]  church.
[2918.00 --> 2918.54]  And then we see
[2918.54 --> 2919.54]  that in verse 22.
[2919.54 --> 2922.62]  it says and with
[2922.62 --> 2924.78]  that he breathed
[2924.78 --> 2926.02]  on them and
[2926.02 --> 2928.28]  said receive the
[2928.28 --> 2928.86]  Holy Spirit.
[2929.66 --> 2930.40]  You know I kind
[2930.40 --> 2931.10]  of learned that
[2931.10 --> 2932.06]  this week that in
[2932.06 --> 2933.28]  some denominations
[2933.28 --> 2934.22]  I'm not sure which
[2934.22 --> 2935.82]  ones necessarily but
[2935.82 --> 2936.56]  that sometimes in
[2936.56 --> 2938.22]  ordination like I
[2938.22 --> 2938.80]  think in like the
[2938.80 --> 2939.66]  Orthodox Church maybe
[2939.66 --> 2941.00]  the the bishop will
[2941.00 --> 2943.48]  actually breathe on
[2943.48 --> 2944.44]  the person being
[2944.44 --> 2944.96]  ordained.
[2945.20 --> 2946.08]  Kind of this idea of
[2946.08 --> 2947.40]  like being empowered
[2947.40 --> 2947.88]  with the Holy
[2947.88 --> 2948.22]  Spirit.
[2949.58 --> 2950.54]  No one breathed on
[2950.54 --> 2951.06]  me in my
[2951.06 --> 2953.46]  ordination but it's
[2953.46 --> 2953.96]  kind of cool.
[2956.92 --> 2957.86]  You know and the
[2957.86 --> 2959.84]  thing is Jesus he
[2959.84 --> 2960.64]  says as the Father
[2960.64 --> 2961.38]  sent me so I'm
[2961.38 --> 2962.12]  sending you but then
[2962.12 --> 2963.24]  he doesn't say so
[2963.24 --> 2964.88]  go ahead.
[2965.40 --> 2966.42]  Right no he he
[2966.42 --> 2967.72]  knows that we
[2967.72 --> 2968.44]  cannot do this
[2968.44 --> 2969.24]  mission in our own
[2969.24 --> 2969.60]  power.
[2970.72 --> 2971.70]  We can't do it in
[2971.70 --> 2972.64]  our own wisdom our
[2972.64 --> 2973.96]  own ingenuity our
[2973.96 --> 2975.26]  own creativity our
[2975.26 --> 2975.84]  own goodness.
[2976.94 --> 2977.74]  Everything that we
[2977.74 --> 2979.42]  do as a church will
[2979.42 --> 2980.66]  be a work of God.
[2981.44 --> 2982.24]  The power of the
[2982.24 --> 2982.76]  Holy Spirit.
[2983.42 --> 2984.24]  And this is really
[2984.24 --> 2985.10]  important because it
[2985.10 --> 2985.98]  means that Jesus has
[2985.98 --> 2987.06]  not left us alone.
[2987.80 --> 2989.00]  He remains present
[2989.00 --> 2989.80]  with us.
[2990.38 --> 2992.06]  Even while we go to
[2992.06 --> 2993.14]  be present with other
[2993.14 --> 2994.18]  people in hard
[2994.18 --> 2995.28]  situations with people
[2995.28 --> 2996.18]  who are maybe we
[2996.18 --> 2997.02]  don't want to be with
[2997.02 --> 2998.50]  Jesus is actually
[2998.50 --> 3000.68]  there with us.
[3001.38 --> 3002.20]  Empowering us.
[3002.52 --> 3003.38]  He continues to be
[3003.38 --> 3004.20]  present with us.
[3004.20 --> 3006.32]  And so let's not
[3006.32 --> 3007.92]  try to live a life
[3007.92 --> 3008.90]  of mission without
[3008.90 --> 3009.84]  the Holy Spirit
[3009.84 --> 3011.40]  outside the Holy
[3011.40 --> 3011.70]  Spirit.
[3012.78 --> 3013.82]  I tried it.
[3013.88 --> 3014.74]  It doesn't work.
[3016.48 --> 3018.14]  You have a power
[3018.14 --> 3019.18]  inside of you.
[3019.82 --> 3021.12]  You have the love of
[3021.12 --> 3022.20]  God poured into your
[3022.20 --> 3022.52]  heart.
[3022.78 --> 3024.62]  You have gifts to
[3024.62 --> 3025.88]  make you useful to
[3025.88 --> 3026.42]  the King.
[3026.42 --> 3029.66]  And that all comes
[3029.66 --> 3030.40]  from the Holy Spirit.
[3031.34 --> 3032.98]  And so why, as we
[3032.98 --> 3034.50]  close, why should you
[3034.50 --> 3036.32]  care about God's
[3036.32 --> 3037.14]  mission in the world?
[3038.42 --> 3038.64]  Right?
[3038.70 --> 3040.58]  Why should you be a
[3040.58 --> 3041.28]  part of God's
[3041.28 --> 3041.54]  mission?
[3042.76 --> 3044.88]  It's because when you
[3044.88 --> 3045.88]  understand the gospel
[3045.88 --> 3047.64]  that despite all of
[3047.64 --> 3048.80]  your sins Jesus has
[3048.80 --> 3050.44]  forgiven you and he's
[3050.44 --> 3051.36]  made you part of his
[3051.36 --> 3052.96]  kingdom and when you
[3052.96 --> 3054.06]  realize that Jesus is
[3054.06 --> 3055.54]  sending you in the same
[3055.54 --> 3057.58]  way and he's filled you
[3057.58 --> 3058.28]  with the power of the
[3058.28 --> 3059.58]  Holy Spirit so that all
[3059.58 --> 3060.70]  of your personality and
[3060.70 --> 3061.58]  talents are now in
[3061.58 --> 3063.42]  service to Christ, when
[3063.42 --> 3064.24]  that happens in your
[3064.24 --> 3065.38]  life you are becoming
[3065.38 --> 3066.42]  what you were made for.
[3067.44 --> 3071.26]  You are the church, the
[3071.26 --> 3072.40]  foretaste of the kingdom
[3072.40 --> 3072.92]  of God.
[3073.84 --> 3075.36]  You are the hands and
[3075.36 --> 3076.70]  the feet and the heart
[3076.70 --> 3078.70]  of Christ in the world.
[3079.04 --> 3079.58]  And you are
[3079.58 --> 3080.66]  participating in the
[3080.66 --> 3081.14]  mission of the
[3081.14 --> 3081.70]  triune God.
[3081.70 --> 3083.54]  And so, you know,
[3083.60 --> 3084.44]  friends, despite the
[3084.44 --> 3086.32]  challenges of being a
[3086.32 --> 3087.60]  Christian in this time and
[3087.60 --> 3088.48]  this place that we live
[3088.48 --> 3090.30]  in, we still have a
[3090.30 --> 3090.52]  mission.
[3091.38 --> 3093.58]  And God always calls us in
[3093.58 --> 3094.62]  the midst of our weakness
[3094.62 --> 3097.54]  to trust in him, to be
[3097.54 --> 3098.38]  empowered by him.
[3098.58 --> 3099.56]  So let me just close with
[3099.56 --> 3101.06]  this one verse from the
[3101.06 --> 3101.66]  Apostle Paul.
[3102.88 --> 3105.50]  2 Corinthians 4, verse 7.
[3106.28 --> 3106.98]  Paul said,
[3106.98 --> 3108.36]  But we have this
[3108.36 --> 3111.14]  treasure, the gospel, in
[3111.14 --> 3111.80]  jars of clay.
[3113.00 --> 3114.26]  We are jars of clay.
[3114.52 --> 3115.50]  We are weak.
[3116.18 --> 3117.36]  We are fragile.
[3119.04 --> 3121.28]  To show that this all
[3121.28 --> 3123.24]  surpassing power is from
[3123.24 --> 3125.32]  God and not from us.
[3126.84 --> 3128.20]  So, friends, may the Lord
[3128.20 --> 3130.74]  build his kingdom among us.
[3131.34 --> 3132.88]  May he build his kingdom
[3132.88 --> 3134.18]  through us.
[3134.18 --> 3136.14]  And may he show his
[3136.14 --> 3138.82]  surpassing power in us
[3138.82 --> 3140.22]  for his glory.
[3140.90 --> 3141.76]  Let's pray together.
[3144.80 --> 3146.02]  Father in heaven, we
[3146.02 --> 3147.00]  praise you that this
[3147.00 --> 3149.14]  mission that began so
[3149.14 --> 3152.42]  many centuries ago has
[3152.42 --> 3154.20]  amazingly reached us
[3154.20 --> 3156.04]  across the globe as the
[3156.04 --> 3158.20]  gospel has gone forth, as
[3158.20 --> 3159.50]  people have extended the
[3159.50 --> 3160.94]  mission of Christ throughout
[3160.94 --> 3161.90]  the centuries and around
[3161.90 --> 3162.32]  the world.
[3162.32 --> 3164.72]  And you have rescued us
[3164.72 --> 3165.72]  and you've forgiven us
[3165.72 --> 3166.84]  and you've adopted us.
[3167.12 --> 3167.88]  You've brought us into
[3167.88 --> 3168.42]  your family.
[3169.10 --> 3171.42]  And would you send us on
[3171.42 --> 3171.72]  mission?
[3172.24 --> 3173.40]  Would you make us useful
[3173.40 --> 3174.06]  for your kingdom?
[3174.92 --> 3176.12]  Would you give us strength
[3176.12 --> 3177.20]  in the life of your Holy
[3177.20 --> 3177.52]  Spirit?
[3178.18 --> 3179.22]  In Christ's name we pray.
[3179.48 --> 3179.74]  Amen.
[3182.40 --> 3184.26]  Okay, let's rise and Paul
[3184.26 --> 3185.90]  will introduce our song.
[3186.54 --> 3188.34]  Okay, let's rise.
[3188.60 --> 3190.56]  I was pleased to find a hymn
[3190.56 --> 3192.42]  that had some verses that
[3192.42 --> 3194.08]  dovetailed perfectly and
[3194.08 --> 3196.04]  described, again, the
[3196.04 --> 3198.12]  Trinity and the mission and
[3198.12 --> 3199.76]  set to all creatures of our
[3199.76 --> 3200.40]  God and King.
[3200.96 --> 3203.22]  The other one, as on the
[3203.22 --> 3205.36]  screen, is from all that
[3205.36 --> 3206.32]  dwell below the skies.
[3206.40 --> 3207.80]  Let's enjoy this familiar
[3207.80 --> 3210.54]  tune with this great set of
[3210.54 --> 3212.50]  words that continues the
[3212.50 --> 3213.70]  thoughts that we've heard
[3213.70 --> 3214.98]  from Pastor Jason this
[3214.98 --> 3215.24]  morning.
[3215.24 --> 3231.62]  O creatures of our God and
[3231.62 --> 3236.12]  King, lift up your voice and
[3236.12 --> 3237.80]  let us sing.
[3237.80 --> 3244.50]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3244.50 --> 3248.38]  O burning sun with golden
[3248.38 --> 3253.06]  me, and shining moon with
[3253.06 --> 3260.60]  self-worn me, O praise Him, O praise Him.
[3260.60 --> 3270.60]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3272.60 --> 3278.24]  Come, all that dwell below the skies,
[3278.24 --> 3283.68]  let the Creator's praise arise.
[3283.68 --> 3288.68]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3288.68 --> 3297.44]  Let the Redeemer's name be sung through every
[3297.44 --> 3300.84]  hand and every tongue.
[3300.84 --> 3315.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3315.84 --> 3317.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3317.84 --> 3326.84]  In every land begin the song, to every land the

[3329.84 --> 3331.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3331.84 --> 3333.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3333.84 --> 3343.84]  In cheerful sound our voices raise, and fill the world with joy
[3343.84 --> 3344.84]  joy for praise.

[3350.84 --> 3356.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3356.84 --> 3358.84]  Alleluia.

[3370.84 --> 3371.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3372.84 --> 3374.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[3374.84 --> 3380.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia
[3380.84 --> 3386.84]  Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore
[3386.84 --> 3391.84]  Till sun shall rise and set no more

[3397.84 --> 3404.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia
[3404.84 --> 3407.84]  Alleluia
[3420.84 --> 3425.84]  Let all things their Creator bless
[3425.84 --> 3431.84]  And worship Him in humblowness
[3431.84 --> 3437.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia
[3437.84 --> 3443.84]  Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
[3443.84 --> 3448.84]  And praise the Spirit, three in heart
[3448.84 --> 3452.84]  Alleluia, Alleluia

[3468.84 --> 3474.84]  Amen, you may be seated
[3474.84 --> 3484.84]  Our offering today is for our denominational ministries. The Christian Reformed Church has ministries that support our churches in multiple ways with Thrive, reach out to the world as well as here at home to the church.
[3484.84 --> 3501.84]  Our offering today is for our denominational ministries. The Christian Reformed Church has ministries that support our churches in multiple ways with Thrive, reach out to the world as well as here at home with the gospel in resonate global missions and reframe and support our denominational seminary. Let us give from the heart.
[3501.84 --> 3521.84]  Music leader in the church,
[3521.84 --> 3528.84]  The leader in the church, Andre Crouch wrote the song, Jesus is the answer for the world today. We'd like to share that for the offering today.
[3528.84 --> 3546.64]  Music be
[3558.84 --> 3588.82]  Thank you.
[3588.84 --> 3618.82]  Thank you.
[3618.84 --> 3648.82]  Thank you.
[3648.84 --> 3678.82]  Thank you.
[3678.84 --> 3708.82]  Thank you.
[3708.84 --> 3710.84]  Thank you.
[3710.84 --> 3712.84]  Thank you.
[3712.84 --> 3714.84]  Thank you.
[3714.84 --> 3716.84]  Thank you.
[3716.84 --> 3722.84]  Thank you.
[3722.84 --> 3728.78]  I'd just like to take a few minutes and talk to you about a trip I took recently with World
[3728.78 --> 3729.16]  Renew.
[3729.84 --> 3740.04]  I took a trip to Guatemala and I spent a week there on a learning tour with World Renew.
[3740.04 --> 3746.52]  I was part of a group of 10 people from Canada and the U.S., plus we had a World Renew guide
[3746.52 --> 3747.98]  and a translator.
[3747.98 --> 3751.04]  And next slide.
[3751.04 --> 3758.98]  World Renew has been involved with Guatemala since 1976 when they had a major earthquake.
[3758.98 --> 3764.98]  And Guatemala has had a troubled past, as a lot of Central American countries have.
[3764.98 --> 3768.98]  It was colonized by the Spaniards and became independent in 1821.
[3768.98 --> 3777.10]  So the official language is Spanish, but there are still 23 indigenous languages spoken in
[3777.10 --> 3777.98]  Guatemala.
[3777.98 --> 3781.98]  And many people that we encountered could not speak Spanish.
[3781.98 --> 3784.98]  They could only speak their indigenous language.
[3784.98 --> 3785.98]  Next slide.
[3785.98 --> 3797.98]  With the things we're doing, the World Renew is doing in Guatemala, the goals are renew hope, reconcile lives, and restore creation.
[3797.98 --> 3802.98]  And I witnessed all this in the tour we took.
[3802.98 --> 3804.98]  Next slide.
[3804.98 --> 3807.98]  This is a map of Guatemala.
[3807.98 --> 3811.98]  And if you look at the very top part there, that's a province, Petan it's called.
[3811.98 --> 3820.98]  And we flew up there and we visited three communities, rural communities that World Renew is involved with.
[3820.98 --> 3831.98]  And if you can read the small print up top it says, APIDEQ, which is a Spanish acronym, which I couldn't begin to say.
[3831.98 --> 3838.98]  And we went up there and World Renew works, those are all partners that World Renew works with.
[3838.98 --> 3842.98]  So, and all those partners are local initiatives.
[3842.98 --> 3849.98]  Many of them don't have the wherewithal, their funding, and they just need strong support.
[3849.98 --> 3853.98]  They just need structure and that's where World Renew comes alongside of them.
[3853.98 --> 3856.98]  So, we were up in the northern part.
[3856.98 --> 3858.98]  We flew up there.
[3858.98 --> 3859.98]  The staff usually drives up there.
[3859.98 --> 3868.98]  It's about a 12 hour drive from the main city, Antigua where the World Renew office is.
[3868.98 --> 3870.98]  Next picture.
[3870.98 --> 3874.98]  This is the World Renew staff in Guatemala.
[3874.98 --> 3877.98]  And notice they're all Guatemalans.
[3877.98 --> 3882.98]  No one from North America is there running the place.
[3882.98 --> 3888.98]  On the bottom right hand is a young woman named Lucy and she was our guide for the week.
[3888.98 --> 3890.98]  Next.
[3890.98 --> 3897.98]  These are some of the impact areas that World Renew is working in Guatemala.
[3897.98 --> 3905.98]  Food security, community health, economic opportunities, risk management, and peace and justice.
[3905.98 --> 3908.98]  Next, please.
[3908.98 --> 3911.98]  Food security is a big issue.
[3911.98 --> 3921.98]  And this is, of course, with climate change, subsistence farming, they need the crops from one year to make it to the next year.
[3921.98 --> 3929.98]  And this is where World Renew and APDEC, their partner, comes alongside into villages and does training.
[3929.98 --> 3932.98]  Raising chickens.
[3932.98 --> 3938.98]  On the bottom right hand, left, yeah, just the, yeah.
[3938.98 --> 3948.98]  And those chickens, actually, I was told that the initial start of those chickens was part of the, you know, the gift program at Christmas time through World Renew.
[3948.98 --> 3951.98]  Those chickens came from a gift like that.
[3951.98 --> 3953.98]  So it's just a niche.
[3953.98 --> 3955.98]  They just need to help to get started.
[3955.98 --> 3961.98]  Once they get, get something like that, they can, of course, perpetuate and, and sell.
[3961.98 --> 3965.98]  The chickens sell the eggs and provide cash.
[3965.98 --> 3972.98]  They learn about making compost for their gardens, increasing productivity.
[3972.98 --> 3977.98]  And, of course, drought is a major issue, like many parts of the world, and it's a big concern.
[3977.98 --> 3980.98]  Next, please.
[3980.98 --> 3981.98]  Okay, beekeeping.
[3981.98 --> 3983.98]  That's really taken off there.
[3983.98 --> 3985.98]  And it's a great cash crop.
[3985.98 --> 3989.98]  We, we visited some of the farmers that are doing bees and the honey.
[3989.98 --> 3990.98]  They show us the results.
[3990.98 --> 3993.98]  And it's amazing the money that brings in.
[3993.98 --> 3997.98]  They can sell it to the, to the cities that are far away into the markets there.
[3997.98 --> 3998.98]  And it's a great cash.
[3998.98 --> 4003.98]  And as you can, as you can imagine, bringing money into the, into a village, which is just
[4003.98 --> 4005.98]  living on subsistence farming.
[4005.98 --> 4007.98]  And it's brought a lot of hope.
[4007.98 --> 4012.98]  And the women were the ones that took up, took it up.
[4012.98 --> 4018.98]  And then when they saw how successful it was becoming, the men came alongside.
[4018.98 --> 4026.98]  And so it really improved communities because we're told that in many villages there,
[4026.98 --> 4029.98]  there's hardly any men, they've all left.
[4029.98 --> 4036.98]  A lot of them gone to the US, become as undocumented people, sending money back.
[4036.98 --> 4039.98]  And then a lot of them, it dries off.
[4039.98 --> 4043.98]  And they actually, some abandoned their families.
[4043.98 --> 4052.98]  So in some of these villages where, where Epidec and Wooden was working, it's lifted the whole community up.
[4052.98 --> 4061.98]  And, plus also the savings, the, the, the saving programs, the money lending, the small loans.
[4061.98 --> 4065.98]  It just transformed these, these kind of places.
[4065.98 --> 4067.98]  Next.
[4067.98 --> 4069.98]  Economic opportunities.
[4069.98 --> 4074.98]  As I said about learning different methods for growing.
[4074.98 --> 4087.98]  Learning, learning about crops, better way of growing crops, different varieties of crops, especially corn, which is their staple.
[4087.98 --> 4092.98]  And it's not just about giving money and then leaving, but it's about training.
[4092.98 --> 4095.98]  And so this, this has taken years and years.
[4095.98 --> 4100.98]  Like a village like this where we visited, they've been working there for about five years already.
[4100.98 --> 4104.98]  So it's not like just a, it's a long term commitment.
[4104.98 --> 4105.98]  Next.
[4105.98 --> 4108.98]  Community health, of course, is big.
[4108.98 --> 4115.98]  They have, the Epidec has midwives.
[4115.98 --> 4119.98]  And they really focus on maternal health and children up to age two.
[4119.98 --> 4122.98]  So we asked, well, why just up to age two?
[4122.98 --> 4129.98]  And then we were told, I'm sure that people are in healthcare know this, that a child's development up to age two.
[4129.98 --> 4142.98]  And that if a child is malnourished up to age two, even if you help feed them later on, the damage is done already.
[4142.98 --> 4144.98]  And it can't be reversed.
[4144.98 --> 4147.98]  So they're really focusing on that.
[4147.98 --> 4154.98]  They talk about the first 1,000 days from conception to age two, which adds up to about 1,000 days apparently.
[4154.98 --> 4155.98]  Next.
[4155.98 --> 4157.98]  Disaster response.
[4157.98 --> 4167.98]  This is what CR, our World Renews is well known for, going in and just helping in disasters.
[4167.98 --> 4171.98]  We weren't, we didn't see any of that right now.
[4171.98 --> 4172.98]  There's no disasters there.
[4172.98 --> 4174.98]  But worldwide they do this.
[4174.98 --> 4175.98]  Next.
[4175.98 --> 4179.98]  Peace and justice initiatives.
[4179.98 --> 4182.98]  And this theme runs through all the work that is done.
[4182.98 --> 4185.98]  As I said, communities have been transformed.
[4185.98 --> 4191.98]  And we learned that some communities there were very few men because they had gone to the US.
[4191.98 --> 4197.98]  And training has given hope to many and lifted entire communities out of poverty.
[4197.98 --> 4202.98]  Consequently, young men have stuck around.
[4202.98 --> 4207.98]  And when there's employment opportunities, so they can provide for their families.
[4207.98 --> 4208.98]  Next.
[4208.98 --> 4210.98]  Learning and engagement.
[4210.98 --> 4212.98]  That's what I was doing.
[4212.98 --> 4220.98]  The top, let's see, top right hand is our group when we were up in the north.
[4220.98 --> 4225.98]  And that's World Renews, they had a conference, World Renews staff and APDEC staff.
[4225.98 --> 4231.98]  And there's, I don't have time to explain who all those people were, but they're like a board,
[4231.98 --> 4232.98]  local board members.
[4232.98 --> 4234.98]  They're community health workers.
[4234.98 --> 4236.98]  They're a maid wife there.
[4236.98 --> 4237.98]  There's an accountant there.
[4237.98 --> 4238.98]  Yeah.
[4238.98 --> 4239.98]  Yeah.
[4239.98 --> 4248.98]  Just to summarize, Lucy, our guide, told us about a community, the community we were in,
[4248.98 --> 4250.98]  when they first came to help.
[4250.98 --> 4253.98]  Excuse me.
[4253.98 --> 4258.98]  They met in a school room, a man on one side and women on the other.
[4263.98 --> 4264.98]  Excuse me.
[4264.98 --> 4268.98]  We mended all the talking and the women just looked to the floor.
[4268.98 --> 4275.98]  And as we, and now as we witnessed a get together in the same room, the women were so proud
[4275.98 --> 4281.98]  of the initiatives they were involved in, like beekeeping, chickens, making soap, learning crafts,
[4281.98 --> 4282.98]  et cetera.
[4282.98 --> 4287.98]  And some of the women spoke to our group in their indigenous language, which had to be translated
[4287.98 --> 4292.98]  to Spanish and then into English, to thank World Renew for, not for money.
[4292.98 --> 4302.98]  But for the training they received, I think that's what stood out for me from our whole visit.
[4302.98 --> 4307.98]  Lucy said it was the women who got on board and then the men followed.
[4307.98 --> 4315.98]  I was so proud of this CRC ministry, their holistic approach to bringing aid.
[4315.98 --> 4316.98]  Next.
[4316.98 --> 4319.98]  And let's just thank you.
[4319.98 --> 4321.98]  This is from World Renew.
[4321.98 --> 4322.98]  Thank you.
[4322.98 --> 4325.98]  And our church has always been very faithful supporters of World Renew.
[4326.98 --> 4332.98]  And if anybody wants more, I have lots more to tell other things we did.
[4332.98 --> 4333.98]  This is only rural.
[4333.98 --> 4334.98]  We're also in the city.
[4334.98 --> 4336.98]  We met some government agencies.
[4336.98 --> 4342.98]  We met indigenous women's centers, all these things that are happening that World Renew is involved with too.
[4342.98 --> 4349.98]  So I'm actually going to make a presentation next week at the cross training at 9 a.m.
[4349.98 --> 4350.98]  for 45 minutes.
[4350.98 --> 4353.98]  So you're welcome to join me in that too.
[4353.98 --> 4355.98]  So thank you.
[4355.98 --> 4356.98]  Thank you.
[4356.98 --> 4362.98]  .
[4362.98 --> 4380.98]  .
[4380.98 --> 4381.98]  .
[4381.98 --> 4382.98]  .
[4382.98 --> 4383.98]  .
[4410.98 --> 4411.98]  .
[4411.98 --> 4412.98]  .
[4412.98 --> 4413.98]  .
[4440.98 --> 4441.98]  .
[4441.98 --> 4442.98]  .
[4442.98 --> 4443.98]  .
[4470.98 --> 4471.98]  .
[4471.98 --> 4479.98]  .
[4479.98 --> 4480.98]  .
[4480.98 --> 4481.98]  .
[4500.98 --> 4509.96]  We pray for the church universal as it works on your behalf, often in situations of danger, opposition, and persecution.
[4511.58 --> 4520.56]  We pray, too, for the Christian Reformed Church in North America, our denomination, especially as the annual synod meets soon.
[4521.66 --> 4523.48]  Difficult decisions need to be made.
[4524.40 --> 4533.26]  Grant a meeting of hearts and minds, an atmosphere of listening and learning, and an attitude of grace throughout these deliberations.
[4534.70 --> 4541.72]  Lord Hannah van der Kamp is here with us today, visiting from her home and work in Les Vos, Greece.
