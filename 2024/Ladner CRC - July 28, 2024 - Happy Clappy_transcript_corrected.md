[301.72 → 302.06] Good morning.
[302.66 → 304.98] And welcome everyone to our service here today.
[306.12 → 312.76] We're closing in on the end of July with this being our last Sunday in July, so call it the halfway point of summer, if you will.
[312.86 → 317.12] And depending on your situation and your perspective, that could be either inspiring or depressing.
[317.12 → 326.34] Take your pick, but regardless, today is a beautiful summer day, and it's a great day to worship together and spend time in fellowship.
[326.34 → 356.32] My name is Jay Iron.
[356.32 → 369.28] And if you're going to attend the combined Sunday school class today, do not run out of service right after the song Jesus Strong and Kind because Pastor Gary has a nice slideshow that he wants to share a few things about his ministry.
[369.28 → 399.26] So you won't want to miss that.
[399.26 → 429.24] Please join me in prayer.
[429.26 → 459.24] And we'll see you in prayer.

[503.24 → 513.24] We will extol you, God and King, and bless your holy name.
[513.24 → 524.24] Day after day we'll sing your praise forever and forever.
[524.24 → 535.24] One generation will call to the next, our God is good, and his hand is strong.
[535.24 → 551.24] All the world sings his marvellous acts, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[551.24 → 562.24] Great is the Lord in all his ways, he's greatly to be praised.
[562.24 → 573.24] Were we to search for endless days, his greatness none can handle.
[573.24 → 585.24] One generation will call to the next, our God is good, and his hand is strong.
[585.24 → 599.24] All the world sings his marvellous acts, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[599.24 → 606.24] He rose to the branch of an elder in each of those light.
[606.24 → 609.24] Our soul takes forever, ever.
[609.24 → 612.24] We judge each of those new personalities of Jesus and His power.
[612.24 → 624.94] Sing the name of your great now in every generation.
[626.34 → 636.94] One generation will go to the next, where God is good, and his hand is strong.
[636.94 → 650.94] All the world saints have all the songs, and all the words will join me in the air to sing the song.
[650.94 → 667.94] We've chosen the next song, I Love to Tell the Story, in support of Pastor Gary and his work at the Ministry of Seafarers.
[667.94 → 675.14] Meeting seafarers from all over the world, who often have been at sea for long periods of time,
[675.86 → 680.34] helping them with their various needs, sharing the gospel with them.
[680.94 → 687.82] It's a wonderful ministry to be part of, and Pastor Gary has been doing this kind of work all of his life.
[688.38 → 692.98] We thank him for coming and sharing some of his experiences with us today.
[697.94 → 716.94] I love to tell the story of us in things above,
[716.94 → 727.94] Of Jesus and his glory, of Jesus and his love.
[727.94 → 738.94] I love to tell the story, because I know it is true.
[738.94 → 740.94] It's fantastical, my love is true.
[740.94 → 744.94] It's fantastical, my love is true.
[744.94 → 749.94] That nothing else can do.
[749.94 → 755.94] I love to tell the story,
[755.94 → 760.94] Drilling our theme in glory,
[760.94 → 766.94] To tell the old, old story,
[766.94 → 773.94] Of Jesus and his love.
[773.94 → 779.94] I love to tell the story,
[779.94 → 786.94] This pleasant to repeat.
[786.94 → 791.94] What sings a tongue of talent,
[791.94 → 796.94] O wonder, golly sweet.
[796.94 → 802.94] A heart to tell the story,
[802.94 → 807.94] For some have never heard.
[807.94 → 809.94] The message of salvation,
[809.94 → 814.94] The message of salvation,
[814.94 → 819.94] From God's holy word.
[819.94 → 824.94] I love to tell the story,

[847.94 → 855.94] For those who know it best.
[855.94 → 860.94] Sing, hammering and thirsting,
[860.94 → 865.94] To hear the life of rest.
[865.94 → 871.94] And when in scenes of glory,
[871.94 → 877.94] I sing the new, new song,
[877.94 → 879.94] To tell the old, old story,
[879.94 → 883.94] To tell the old, old story,
[883.94 → 885.94] Of Jesus and his love.
[885.94 → 889.94] That I have loved so long.
[889.94 → 893.94] I love to tell the story,
[893.94 → 894.94] And when in scenes of glory,
[894.94 → 896.94] To tell the old, old story,

[898.94 → 903.94] To tell the old, old story,
[903.94 → 908.94] Of Jesus and his love.
[908.94 → 912.94] To tell the old, old story,
[912.94 → 916.94] And when in scenes of glory,
[916.94 → 921.94] And when in scenes of glory,
[921.94 → 926.94] And when in scenes of glory,
[926.94 → 934.00] a few verses from Psalm 95 at this time, first seven verses in your pew Bibles. It's on page
[934.00 → 941.04] 446. I'll be using this thoughtfully provided large print edition up here. So hopefully the
[941.04 → 950.50] text is the same. Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord. Let us shout aloud to the rock of our
[950.50 → 957.30] salvation. Let us come before him with Thanksgiving and extol him with music and song. For the
[957.30 → 963.68] Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods. In his hand are the depths of the
[963.68 → 969.74] earth and the mountain peaks belong to him. The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands
[969.74 → 976.28] formed the dry land. Come, let us bow down in worship. Let us kneel before the Lord our
[976.28 → 982.68] maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.
[982.68 → 1012.66] For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his
[1012.66 → 1017.66] the sum of his visitors. Obviously the joy, and the glory of God, which he is dissent
[1017.66 → 1019.66] be able. In his stepping form. This именно void, the council of my mama wow. I has the
[1019.66 → 1020.08] CY 175 years of the British love Cranwell and Kingdom, and we are the people of his honesty in Bulganin.
[1020.08 → 1038.36] All the men have
[1038.36 → 1047.26] The sovereign life is mercyless forever.
[1050.80 → 1056.78] His wisdom made the heavens to me,
[1056.78 → 1061.44] His love abides forever.
[1061.44 → 1068.48] He spread the earth upon the sea,
[1068.92 → 1073.20] His mercy lasts forever.
[1074.88 → 1080.48] Praise Him, who's all the things that are in,
[1080.88 → 1085.24] His love abides forever.
[1085.24 → 1092.98] The moon and stars, His light is slain,
[1093.48 → 1098.16] His mercy lasts forever.
[1101.78 → 1107.86] He helped us in our deepest hopes,
[1108.24 → 1112.50] His love abides forever.
[1112.50 → 1119.90] He breathes the depths from all our flows,
[1120.28 → 1124.82] His mercy lasts forever.
[1126.44 → 1129.46] Each creature will sing,
[1129.72 → 1131.88] He will suffer,
[1132.56 → 1136.50] His love abides forever.
[1136.50 → 1141.84] Give thanks to God,
[1142.18 → 1144.90] and from the Lord,
[1145.34 → 1149.50] His mercy lasts forever.
[1149.50 → 1150.20] He will suffer.
[1150.20 → 1150.44] Amen.
[1150.44 → 1150.86] Amen.
[1150.86 → 1151.24] Amen.
[1164.62 → 1166.72] Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1170.56 → 1172.30] You know how we are, Lord.
[1172.30 → 1176.50] We say that we will take time to refresh our spirits and our souls,
[1176.76 → 1180.54] and then we quickly crowd our lives with activities to the point of exhaustion.
[1181.48 → 1183.52] We turn to you for feeding and nurture,
[1183.98 → 1187.00] asking you to give us something to sustain us through our lives.
[1187.66 → 1189.62] We even are willing to tell you what we have,
[1189.88 → 1190.80] but when we look closely,
[1191.44 → 1193.84] we discover that we bring so little to you.
[1195.76 → 1196.82] Take what we have,
[1197.20 → 1198.66] our gifts and our needs.
[1198.66 → 1202.04] Heal and forgive us when we boldly disobey your word.
[1203.00 → 1207.80] Remind us that you have given to us all that we need to serve you in this world.
[1208.70 → 1212.12] The world abounds with your miracles of love and hope.
[1213.20 → 1214.56] Open our eyes to see them,
[1214.98 → 1217.22] and our hearts to know that these are from you,
[1217.76 → 1218.88] and not of our own making.
[1220.48 → 1223.56] Heal and restore us to your everlasting love.
[1224.02 → 1225.18] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1226.08 → 1226.40] Amen.
[1226.40 → 1226.50] Amen.
[1228.66 → 1232.68] You have been created for good works in Christ Jesus.
[1233.48 → 1235.06] Remember your created intention.
[1235.88 → 1236.90] Remember your purpose.
[1237.88 → 1238.78] Go back to your roots,
[1238.96 → 1242.34] and know God's love and grace and forgiveness have always,
[1242.72 → 1244.04] always been there.
[1244.74 → 1245.34] Accept it,
[1245.80 → 1246.72] know it in your heart,
[1247.12 → 1249.66] and live into the life Christ has promised you,
[1249.76 → 1251.04] now and through eternity.
[1252.12 → 1254.06] Let's celebrate that in song with Jesus,
[1254.30 → 1254.94] strong and kind.
[1254.94 → 1255.00] Amen.
[1255.00 → 1255.02] Amen.
[1258.66 → 1277.90] Jesus said that if I thirst,
[1277.90 → 1282.64] I should come to him.
[1282.64 → 1300.66] Jesus said that if I am weak,
[1300.66 → 1305.64] I should come to him.
[1305.64 → 1312.32] No one else can be my strength,
[1312.32 → 1317.44] I should come to him.
[1317.44 → 1323.26] For the Lord is good and faithful,
[1323.26 → 1328.94] He will keep us day and night.
[1328.94 → 1329.46] We are ashram.
[1329.46 → 1331.38] We can know your grace,
[1331.38 → 1334.84] We must be your strength,
[1336.08 → 1336.94] Jesus' strength and kind.
[1338.94 → 1341.92] And he will always run if you are able to save us.
[1341.96 → 1346.76] Jesus said that if I thirst,
[1348.08 → 1353.38] I should come to him.
[1353.38 → 1365.38] No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[1365.38 → 1376.38] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1376.38 → 1389.38] We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1389.38 → 1401.38] Jesus said if I am lost, He will come to me.
[1401.38 → 1413.38] And He showed me on the cross, He will come to me.
[1413.38 → 1425.38] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1425.38 → 1437.38] We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1437.38 → 1449.38] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1449.38 → 1461.38] We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1461.38 → 1473.38] Well, good morning.
[1473.38 → 1477.38] And it's good to be here with you.
[1477.38 → 1481.38] Ringing as we ring.
[1481.38 → 1484.38] Thank you for the warm welcome.
[1484.38 → 1487.38] I don't see a lot of, oh there's a few.
[1487.38 → 1491.38] Okay, so I did want to show some pictures for everyone, for all of you.
[1491.38 → 1493.38] And of the secret of the ministry.
[1493.38 → 1495.38] Am I on?
[1495.38 → 1496.38] Go ahead.
[1496.38 → 1497.38] Pardon?
[1497.38 → 1498.38] Am I on now?
[1498.38 → 1500.38] Okay, we're good.
[1500.38 → 1506.38] So, I, to, away again, I don't know if we can, I guess it's kind of bright with the sun.
[1506.38 → 1509.38] But we're not going to complain about the sun, are we?
[1509.38 → 1511.38] Anyway, it's good to be here again.
[1511.38 → 1515.38] Oh, before I get into that, leave the lights off.
[1515.38 → 1517.38] Jennifer said to say hello.
[1517.38 → 1519.38] I know some people have said to say hi to her.
[1519.38 → 1521.38] Unfortunately, she, well, she had to go down.
[1521.38 → 1524.38] She's spending some time with my mom down in the States.
[1524.38 → 1528.38] And, but, they're watching online, I think.
[1528.38 → 1529.38] I'm pretty sure.
[1529.38 → 1531.38] So, if you'll allow me.
[1531.38 → 1532.38] Hi, Mom.
[1532.38 → 1534.38] Hi, hon.
[1534.38 → 1535.38] Okay.
[1535.38 → 1538.38] I feel like one of those athletes on TV doing that thing.
[1538.38 → 1540.38] Anyway, it's great to be here.
[1540.38 → 1541.38] And, and thank you.
[1541.38 → 1542.38] I've been doing the seafarers' ministry.
[1542.38 → 1545.38] Now, I've been in missions for basically all my adult life.
[1545.38 → 1549.38] But, I've been doing the seafarers' ministry for coming up to seven years now.
[1549.38 → 1555.38] So, and what I do is visit just bulk carriers who just cycle through these.
[1555.38 → 1556.38] I'll let you know.
[1556.38 → 1557.38] Next slide.
[1557.38 → 1562.38] And, container ship coming here to Delta Port as well as into Vancouver.
[1562.38 → 1563.38] Next slide.
[1563.38 → 1568.38] Now, this last two, a week and a half ago, the Black Pearl came to Vancouver.
[1568.38 → 1569.38] Can you believe it?
[1569.38 → 1572.38] Do you remember Pirates of the Caribbean?
[1572.38 → 1573.38] Okay.
[1573.38 → 1577.38] I actually went on board the ship and I inquired, what's the captain's name?
[1577.38 → 1578.38] It was not Jack Sparrow.
[1578.38 → 1580.38] It was Oleg or something.
[1580.38 → 1581.38] He was Ukrainian.
[1581.38 → 1582.38] It was all Ukrainian crew.
[1582.38 → 1585.38] But, I asked the, the second mate, I was talking to the second officer.
[1585.38 → 1586.38] He was also Ukrainian.
[1586.38 → 1589.38] I said, do you get a lot of questions about the name of your ship?
[1589.38 → 1591.38] And, he said, oh yeah.
[1591.38 → 1592.38] So, it was kind of fun.
[1592.38 → 1594.38] I had to take a picture of that one.
[1594.38 → 1597.38] If you're on Facebook, you get the Facebook feed or Instagram.
[1597.38 → 1599.38] You may have seen I posted a picture of it.
[1599.38 → 1601.38] It wasn't haunted or anything.
[1601.38 → 1602.38] Next slide.
[1602.38 → 1606.38] So, as you're aware of this, we serve downtown.
[1606.38 → 1608.38] I do most of my work at the downtown centre.
[1608.38 → 1610.38] I come once a week out too.
[1610.38 → 1611.38] Next slide.
[1611.38 → 1613.38] Delta Port, of course.
[1613.38 → 1617.38] Big construction project happening there as the coal terminals be converted,
[1617.38 → 1619.38] half of it to potash.
[1619.38 → 1622.38] So, there's a huge construction projects.
[1622.38 → 1624.38] Now, we're going to be ready until like 2027.
[1624.38 → 1629.38] I don't know if that will decrease your coal dust here or not, but it's,
[1629.38 → 1632.38] they are changing it up a little bit out at West Shore.
[1632.38 → 1634.38] But, just still love going both places.
[1634.38 → 1636.38] It's really always a joy.
[1636.38 → 1637.38] Next slide.
[1637.38 → 1641.38] Okay, you're, some of you have been there, but that's the downtown centre.
[1641.38 → 1644.38] And, the next slide is, of course, our Roberts Bank.
[1644.38 → 1650.38] Now, there are construction trailers right in front of it, and it's a mess out there.
[1650.38 → 1654.38] But, we still carry on with the ministry that's happening there.
[1654.38 → 1655.38] Next slide.
[1655.38 → 1662.38] Again, this is, I wanted to share, this is, I explained this before, but there are literally
[1662.38 → 1664.38] hundreds of seafarers centres around the world.
[1664.38 → 1666.38] We are part of a big network.
[1666.38 → 1669.38] They say, estimate six to seven hundred depends.
[1669.38 → 1670.38] Sometimes it's just one worker.
[1670.38 → 1672.38] Sometimes it's a whole centre.
[1672.38 → 1673.38] But, there are hundreds of them.
[1673.38 → 1674.38] So, I go and board a ship.
[1674.38 → 1677.38] They know exactly what a seafarer centre is.
[1677.38 → 1679.38] And, you know, how do we get there?
[1679.38 → 1680.38] What time are you open?
[1680.38 → 1682.38] And, this kind of questions.
[1682.38 → 1683.38] Next slide.
[1683.38 → 1685.38] Just to share a little bit.
[1685.38 → 1688.38] I was in, I had a three-month sabbatical this year.
[1688.38 → 1694.38] And, so, two of the months, or just about seven weeks, Jenny and I were in, back in Asia,
[1694.38 → 1699.38] to reconnect with Malaysia, where we ministered for about ten years.
[1699.38 → 1702.38] And, we visited also Indonesia briefly.
[1702.38 → 1706.38] And, then we were in Singapore to connect, because we had a lot of, I have a lot of friends
[1706.38 → 1707.38] there as well.
[1707.38 → 1710.38] While in Singapore, I visited the port.
[1710.38 → 1717.38] Now, Vancouver, and these are some of the port workers, the chaplains in Singapore.
[1717.38 → 1722.38] The two centre, the couple in the middle are with the Anglican Church Mission to Seafarers.
[1722.38 → 1725.38] And, then the two guys on the outside are with the Lutheran Church.
[1725.38 → 1728.38] So, they have a number of seafarer centres.
[1728.38 → 1736.38] So, Vancouver is, just to give you a picture, Vancouver is the largest and busiest port in Canada.
[1736.38 → 1747.38] We have approximately 3,000, a little over 3,000 ships each year come to visit the port of Vancouver,
[1747.38 → 1749.38] including the cruise ships.
[1749.38 → 1751.38] So, about 3,000 ship visits.
[1751.38 → 1754.38] The largest in Canada.
[1754.38 → 1756.38] It's moderate.
[1756.38 → 1759.38] It's in, compared to say, Houston gets, I think, 6,000.
[1759.38 → 1761.38] I don't even know what they get down in LA and Long Beach.
[1761.38 → 1762.38] 3,000.
[1762.38 → 1766.38] I asked them in Singapore, how many ships do you get a year?
[1766.38 → 1768.38] 140,000.
[1768.38 → 1769.38] Unbelievable.
[1769.38 → 1774.38] I just said, how do you possibly handle that?
[1774.38 → 1781.38] And, they, I said, you know, we visit, you know, probably roughly 80% of the ships that come in or more.
[1781.38 → 1784.38] We get on the majority of ships.
[1784.38 → 1785.38] How many do you get on?
[1785.38 → 1789.38] He said, we get on 2% of the ships that come through our port.
[1789.38 → 1791.38] That's how big Singapore is.
[1791.38 → 1794.38] Now, Singapore and Shanghai are the two biggest ports in the world.
[1794.38 → 1798.38] So, not too surprising, but it's unbelievable.
[1798.38 → 1803.38] So, you can see how this ministry, the opportunities in some places are vast.
[1803.38 → 1806.38] I much prefer working in a much smaller port, okay?
[1806.38 → 1808.38] It's a lot easier to deal with.
[1808.38 → 1813.38] But, anyway, it's, it was fascinating to be there and to see what's happening in other parts of the world.
[1813.38 → 1814.38] Next slide.
[1814.38 → 1818.38] So, again, we do Christmas, but we do this all around the year.
[1818.38 → 1820.38] Now, we just call it our Goodwill Project.
[1820.38 → 1825.38] And we give, we don't give gifts all year, but we give care packages for each ship.
[1825.38 → 1828.38] And then at Christmas, we give presents, again, for each individual seafarers.
[1828.38 → 1829.38] We do other things.
[1829.38 → 1830.38] Next slide.
[1830.38 → 1835.38] Like, I gave out, again, Good Friday, I always give out hot cross buns from Cobb's.
[1835.38 → 1837.38] And, and they love them.
[1837.38 → 1838.38] And they gave some Easter eggs.
[1838.38 → 1840.38] And we do little services and things like that.
[1840.38 → 1849.38] So, it's always fun to be able to celebrate holidays and all the time that they're here, just to celebrate and thank them for what they do.
[1849.38 → 1850.38] Next slide.
[1850.38 → 1852.38] I wanted to share a little story.
[1852.38 → 1853.38] I met Alvin.
[1853.38 → 1855.38] He was a Filipino seafarer.
[1855.38 → 1858.38] I came to the centre.
[1858.38 → 1860.38] It was in the morning.
[1860.38 → 1862.38] It was like 11 in the morning or something like that.
[1862.38 → 1863.38] And there was a seafarer.
[1863.38 → 1866.38] We're technically not open, but if we're there, we just open it up anyway.
[1866.38 → 1870.38] And sometimes a seafarer, most of them come in the afternoons and evenings.
[1870.38 → 1873.38] But occasionally you'll get one coming in.
[1873.38 → 1879.38] Alvin was in, down from my office, and he had this big smile on his face.
[1879.38 → 1881.38] And I thought, okay, there's a story behind this.
[1881.38 → 1883.38] And I sat down, and I said, how are you doing?
[1883.38 → 1884.38] Introduce myself.
[1884.38 → 1885.38] And we got chatting.
[1885.38 → 1887.38] I said, you look really happy.
[1887.38 → 1888.38] What's going on?
[1888.38 → 1893.38] And he said, well, you know, I just got a promotion.
[1893.38 → 1898.38] And I just got promoted from just like they call it an oiler.
[1898.38 → 1902.38] It's just one of the ratings in the engine room to fourth engineer.
[1902.38 → 1906.38] And he said, it's, I'm really excited.
[1906.38 → 1910.38] And he said, not only does it mean a promotion, it means his pay was doubled.
[1910.38 → 1912.38] So that's pretty exciting too.
[1912.38 → 1915.38] And so he had said, I had to go to town and celebrate.
[1915.38 → 1919.38] I said, I got by a few things and nobody else could go, but I had to go.
[1919.38 → 1921.38] And I said, that is awesome.
[1921.38 → 1924.38] So we had a chat for a while, and then he needed to get back to the ship.
[1924.38 → 1927.38] So I brought him back and with another friend and, and we got back.
[1927.38 → 1929.38] I said, Alvin, can I pray with you?
[1929.38 → 1931.38] This is really exciting.
[1931.38 → 1933.38] And I was thinking about that afterwards.
[1933.38 → 1936.38] I thought, you know, often we come up, and we share the hard stories
[1936.38 → 1941.38] and there are difficult, challenging times for seafarers as for all of us,
[1941.38 → 1943.38] but there are also really happy stories.
[1943.38 → 1947.38] And, and I'll have guys say, hey, here's my new baby.
[1947.38 → 1950.38] My wife just bore, you know, yesterday or whatever.
[1950.38 → 1955.38] You know, just had a baby or last week, or we're celebrating a birthday or something.
[1955.38 → 1959.38] And it's fun to be able to celebrate with people as well.
[1959.38 → 1961.38] And we're going to see more about that.
[1961.38 → 1963.38] This, this is the introduction to the sermon, by the way.
[1963.38 → 1964.38] Okay.
[1964.38 → 1967.38] But it was fun to meet Alvin and to, again, to share with you.
[1967.38 → 1969.38] I asked him, can I share this with people?
[1969.38 → 1970.38] And he said, yeah, sure.
[1970.38 → 1971.38] Go ahead.
[1971.38 → 1975.38] So we get to celebrate the good times with seafarers as well.
[1975.38 → 1977.38] Finally, I think there's just one more slide.
[1977.38 → 1978.38] Yeah.
[1978.38 → 1980.38] You know this information already.
[1980.38 → 1982.38] Instagram, Facebook, Ministry to Seafarers Vancouver.
[1982.38 → 1988.38] And thanks again for your support, for offerings, prayers, and, and all of that, and encouragement.
[1988.38 → 1994.38] So, I, kids, let me pray for you, and then we'll send you off to, to your Sunday school.
[1994.38 → 2006.38] Heavenly Father, thank you for your goodness to us and to your people all over the world.
[2006.38 → 2014.38] Thank you for Alvin and for the, the, the good news that he received and for others who have various things to celebrate.
[2014.38 → 2020.38] We, we love to rejoice with those who rejoice, and we also weep with those who weep.
[2020.38 → 2024.38] And so, help us to do that in, in special ways.
[2024.38 → 2033.38] And, and, and now as the children, head to their, their joint Sunday school class, bless them and go with them and their teachers.
[2033.38 → 2036.38] And guide us as we open your word, Lord.
[2036.38 → 2043.38] And let the words of my mouth and the meditation of all our hearts be acceptable in your sight.
[2043.38 → 2045.38] Oh, Lord, our rock and our redeemer.
[2045.38 → 2046.38] Amen.
[2046.38 → 2047.38] Amen.
[2047.38 → 2058.38] Kids, you're invited to head off, those who want to go.
[2058.38 → 2069.38] And I would invite you, if you want to open your Bibles, to turn to Psalm 100.
[2069.38 → 2070.38] 100.
[2070.38 → 2081.38] For a joyful, celebrative psalm, a psalm of praise.
[2081.38 → 2086.38] The title is, a psalm for giving grateful praise.
[2086.38 → 2091.38] And here's the, the, the, the, the, of the psalm.
[2091.38 → 2095.38] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[2095.38 → 2098.38] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[2098.38 → 2102.38] And for him with joyful song.
[2102.38 → 2105.38] Know that the Lord is God.
[2105.38 → 2110.38] He who makes us, we are his.
[2110.38 → 2114.38] We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[2114.38 → 2121.38] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[2121.38 → 2125.38] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[2125.38 → 2127.38] For the Lord is good.
[2127.38 → 2130.38] And his love endures forever.
[2130.38 → 2135.38] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[2135.38 → 2142.38] Well, I shared that story of Alvin and the good news.
[2142.38 → 2150.38] And it reminded me again of how important it is to at times rejoice.
[2150.38 → 2152.38] To celebrate.
[2152.38 → 2163.38] In, in particularly a world that is often in turmoil and warfare happening all over the world.
[2163.38 → 2167.38] And various challenges and even in our own lives.
[2167.38 → 2172.38] And yet the psalmist, and the psalmist does lament often.
[2172.38 → 2181.38] But the psalmist also calls us, in spite of all that's happening, there's still God.
[2181.38 → 2184.38] And the psalmist remind us of that regularly.
[2184.38 → 2185.38] There's still God.
[2185.38 → 2190.38] And we can celebrate and rejoice in him.
[2190.38 → 2193.38] And that's what this psalm is all about.
[2193.38 → 2200.38] Now, it's an interesting psalm in terms of the structure, the way it's organized, actually.
[2200.38 → 2202.38] And structure may not excite you.
[2202.38 → 2206.38] But it is very interesting to look at how it is divided out.
[2206.38 → 2209.38] Because there are actually, I know they have five verses here.
[2209.38 → 2214.38] There are actually four really stanzas of this psalm.
[2214.38 → 2219.38] And the four stanzas each have three lines.
[2219.38 → 2221.38] So it's very well organized.
[2221.38 → 2228.38] It's very structured and simple, but also very succinct.
[2228.38 → 2231.38] And it really shows something through that structure.
[2231.38 → 2236.38] Because, first, it's a psalm of praise.
[2236.38 → 2242.38] And psalms of praise typically have a call to praise.
[2242.38 → 2245.38] And then they tell us why.
[2245.38 → 2246.38] So, again.
[2246.38 → 2249.38] Shout for joy to the Lord.
[2249.38 → 2251.38] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[2251.38 → 2254.38] Come before him with Thanksgiving, with joyful song, sorry.
[2254.38 → 2255.38] Why?
[2255.38 → 2259.38] Know that the Lord, he's God.
[2259.38 → 2261.38] It is he who made us.
[2261.38 → 2262.38] We are his.
[2262.38 → 2263.38] We are his people.
[2263.38 → 2264.38] The sheep of his pasture.
[2264.38 → 2267.38] That's why we come before him with praise.
[2267.38 → 2270.38] And then there's another, the second section really.
[2270.38 → 2272.38] So it's four stanzas, but two sections.
[2272.38 → 2275.38] The second section is, again, a call to praise.
[2275.38 → 2278.38] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[2278.38 → 2280.38] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[2280.38 → 2281.38] Why?
[2281.38 → 2287.38] The Lord, this God that we know now, the Lord is good.
[2287.38 → 2289.38] And his love endures forever.
[2289.38 → 2293.38] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[2293.38 → 2297.38] So that's the basic kind of outline of how the psalm goes.
[2297.38 → 2299.38] But there's more.
[2299.38 → 2308.38] Because the first three stanzas are divided out in, or they're sort of organized in a special way.
[2308.38 → 2316.38] There are seven imperatives, seven commands in the first three stanzas.
[2316.38 → 2318.38] Seven, of course, is a biblical number.
[2318.38 → 2320.38] Many of you are aware.
[2320.38 → 2325.38] In stanza one, you have three commands.
[2325.38 → 2329.38] Shout for joy to the Lord.
[2329.38 → 2331.38] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[2331.38 → 2332.38] Enter.
[2332.38 → 2335.38] It's the same word as later in verse four.
[2335.38 → 2337.38] Enter, or come before him.
[2337.38 → 2338.38] Enter his presence.
[2338.38 → 2341.38] Come before him with joyful songs.
[2341.38 → 2348.38] And then the third stanza also has three commands, three imperatives.
[2348.38 → 2349.38] Enter, the same word again.
[2349.38 → 2354.38] Enter, or come into his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[2354.38 → 2358.38] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[2358.38 → 2360.38] Three at the first stanza.
[2360.38 → 2362.38] Three in the third stanza.
[2362.38 → 2366.38] And in the middle, there's one command.
[2366.38 → 2373.38] And the way, when the psalmist or when the scriptures organize things like that, we call it a chiastic structure.
[2373.38 → 2375.38] It's based on a Greek letter.
[2375.38 → 2379.38] But it comes to a point, the focus is the middle one.
[2379.38 → 2384.38] That middle command is the centre of the psalm.
[2384.38 → 2390.38] And the middle command is, know that the Lord is God.
[2390.38 → 2393.38] So that's the key focus.
[2393.38 → 2396.38] The focus isn't on our praise.
[2396.38 → 2399.38] The focus is on our praise to God.
[2399.38 → 2402.38] He's the central focus.
[2402.38 → 2411.38] And it comes through in other ways, too, because the wording in this psalm.
[2411.38 → 2413.38] There are, now it depends on how you divide it out.
[2413.38 → 2415.38] Hebrew is always much more succinct.
[2415.38 → 2421.38] Where we have maybe sometimes two, three, or four words in English, there's just one word in Hebrew.
[2421.38 → 2425.38] So in Hebrew, I kind of counted it out if you add up all the pronouns and everything.
[2425.38 → 2431.38] There are 50 plus words in Hebrew in this entire psalm.
[2431.38 → 2436.38] I counted 57, but it kind of varies depending on how exactly you divide it.
[2436.38 → 2437.38] 57.
[2437.38 → 2440.38] 17 of those words refer to God.
[2441.38 → 2442.38] 17.
[2442.38 → 2443.38] 17.
[2443.38 → 2447.38] It's like a third of the psalm is just God.
[2447.38 → 2453.38] The Lord, his divine name is used four times with capital, all capitals, you notice.
[2453.38 → 2454.38] 17.
[2454.38 → 2463.38] God is used once And then him, his, he, and often those pronouns him, his, he is emphatic.
[2463.38 → 2466.38] In Hebrew, sometimes you don't have to have the pronoun.
[2466.38 → 2469.38] It's just in the verbal conjugation, for example.
[2469.38 → 2475.28] but you add it for emphasis, and often it's added to make it even more emphatic.
[2475.64 → 2479.00] He, him, it's his. We are his people.
[2479.90 → 2483.70] And then the other term that comes up is his name.
[2483.80 → 2484.78] I've added that one in.
[2484.84 → 2488.40] So Bruce Walk, if you read his commentary on it, he says there are 16 words.
[2488.50 → 2491.92] I make it 17 because I say his name also refers to him.
[2492.66 → 2497.44] Modern Jews still refer to the Lord often as Hashem, the name.
[2497.44 → 2500.28] They don't say his name. They just call him the name.
[2500.36 → 2500.90] Anyway, whatever.
[2501.30 → 2505.54] A lot of the terms are just God in this psalm.
[2506.46 → 2508.86] And so that becomes the focus.
[2509.84 → 2516.38] Okay, now what the psalm calls us to is exuberant joy.
[2517.72 → 2520.92] And it rings all through the psalm.
[2520.92 → 2528.22] The very first term is shout for joy to the Lord.
[2528.30 → 2533.00] Sometimes they put it a little bit softer, make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
[2533.50 → 2534.72] That doesn't cut it.
[2535.22 → 2536.50] NIV gets it right here.
[2536.96 → 2537.88] Shout for joy.
[2538.02 → 2542.46] Because the term that's used was actually, you find it in other places in the scriptures,
[2542.46 → 2548.06] and it's often a war cry or a victory cry in battle.
[2548.74 → 2557.14] The closest we would probably relate to is when your team, your soccer team or your hockey
[2557.14 → 2561.78] team or whatever, and the fans are watching the game, and they score a goal.
[2561.98 → 2562.64] What happens?
[2563.82 → 2565.48] Everyone shouts, right?
[2566.00 → 2566.64] Yes!
[2566.64 → 2571.84] And that's the kind of shout for joy that's implied here.
[2572.48 → 2574.44] That's we're called to give.
[2574.86 → 2577.58] It's a shout for joy to the Lord.
[2578.60 → 2582.48] That kind of cheer for God and for what he's done.
[2582.82 → 2586.74] And then there are three joy terms.
[2586.86 → 2594.72] They're all basically joy in this psalm, especially in verses, well, it's divided out as one and
[2594.72 → 2594.90] two.
[2594.90 → 2596.88] This is the way I translated it.
[2597.30 → 2599.74] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[2600.28 → 2602.62] Serve the Lord with joy.
[2603.60 → 2607.98] Come into his presence with a ringing cry of joy.
[2608.08 → 2611.90] I love the way the lexicon put, divide, or describe that one, define that one.
[2612.16 → 2614.22] A ringing cry of joy.
[2615.44 → 2617.58] Joy, joy, joy.
[2617.86 → 2619.38] Walk says this.
[2619.38 → 2628.62] This psalm is, quote, a hand clapping, foot stomping, leaping up and down with dance kind
[2628.62 → 2630.42] of joy, close quote.
[2631.06 → 2633.74] That's what the psalmist is calling us to.
[2633.74 → 2639.28] That's what he's calling even Dutch people to do.
[2640.32 → 2640.84] Okay?
[2641.46 → 2643.02] And all people.
[2644.58 → 2648.30] That kind of exuberant joy.
[2649.06 → 2653.58] In fact, you can go on to stanza three also has that.
[2653.58 → 2657.10] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving, his courts with praise.
[2657.46 → 2662.30] Give thanks to him and praise or bless his name.
[2662.30 → 2669.80] Now, this song, this psalm was meant to be sung with musical instruments.
[2670.04 → 2673.14] It's, it's, that's the way it's, it's put together.
[2673.42 → 2680.72] And the way that music also, you know, can get us excited.
[2681.38 → 2682.56] The right kind of music.
[2682.92 → 2683.74] Organ and trumpet.
[2684.58 → 2685.74] Playing together.
[2685.74 → 2687.50] Or, or whatever the case.
[2687.58 → 2688.60] I, I still remember.
[2689.38 → 2690.56] Jenny, forgive me for this.
[2691.16 → 2694.24] We went to the U2 concert a number of years ago.
[2694.54 → 2695.40] Somebody got us tickets.
[2695.62 → 2696.42] We went to U2.
[2697.60 → 2700.54] And I, we were nosebleed section.
[2700.70 → 2701.92] But it was packed.
[2702.04 → 2702.74] It was loud.
[2703.10 → 2707.84] And then they came on to, I don't know if you know U2, Bono, but Beautiful Day.
[2707.84 → 2709.04] And Jenny loves that.
[2709.28 → 2713.88] And she just screamed out for Beautiful Day, you know.
[2713.88 → 2717.50] And, and of course, I could hardly hear because everybody else was screaming as well.
[2717.58 → 2719.26] But it was just loud.
[2719.38 → 2725.20] And the way that, that they can get the, the whole audience excited.
[2726.16 → 2728.58] Because there's something to celebrate.
[2728.72 → 2735.16] And the psalmist is calling us to, to that kind of exuberance.
[2736.74 → 2737.18] Passion.
[2738.76 → 2739.24] Joy.
[2739.24 → 2739.34] Joy.
[2742.68 → 2743.74] I was on a walk.
[2744.34 → 2746.62] This is, I can't remember, a year or two ago.
[2747.34 → 2750.14] A cousin came out, one of Jenny's cousins from England.
[2750.26 → 2758.16] And we'd met them just earlier in the year, or again, late the year before, I think, in England.
[2758.72 → 2765.00] And we went to the church and met them at the church where they were, they were worshipping.
[2765.00 → 2768.60] And, and so they came here, and they were doing a cruise.
[2768.70 → 2771.54] So they stopped in and visited us for a little bit.
[2771.58 → 2773.72] And so I was walking the dog with, with him.
[2773.96 → 2776.34] And we were talking about worship and church.
[2776.52 → 2781.68] And, and he was a bit, their, their church is kind of that, that older, more traditional style.
[2781.68 → 2785.14] And, and he didn't have much good to say about contemporary worship.
[2785.70 → 2787.14] And so he was going on and on.
[2787.22 → 2791.94] And then, and he said, yeah, all that happy, crappy stuff.
[2791.94 → 2794.36] That's where the title of the sermon comes from.
[2794.70 → 2797.58] All that happy, crappy stuff.
[2798.46 → 2800.96] And he wasn't being complimentary.
[2801.86 → 2803.66] And, and so we had talking about that a little bit.
[2803.72 → 2804.42] We didn't get into it.
[2804.48 → 2805.92] But I was chatting a little bit.
[2805.92 → 2815.24] And I was saying, yeah, you know, contemporary worship can be happy, crappy in, in, in a negative sense.
[2815.30 → 2819.78] It can be shallow and just sort of emotional, but without any depth.
[2819.78 → 2821.74] But it doesn't have to be.
[2822.76 → 2830.90] And I would argue, lifeless ritual may even be worse.
[2834.42 → 2840.06] Dead worship is an oxymoron.
[2840.06 → 2848.40] God calls us to exuberance and joy.
[2848.94 → 2854.22] I'm reminded, you know, the story of David when they brought the ark into Jerusalem.
[2854.82 → 2857.04] 2 Samuel 6, if you want to look it up.
[2857.08 → 2858.90] It's also in Chronicles, 1 Chronicles.
[2858.90 → 2869.84] But when he brings it in, they tell the story of how David was dancing before the Lord with all his might.
[2869.84 → 2880.50] And when Michael, remember, the white, his wife, one of his wives, the daughter of Saul, saw him, she despised him.
[2881.10 → 2883.96] And she said, oh, you really put it on today.
[2884.12 → 2885.30] Yeah, you really honoured yourself.
[2885.42 → 2886.22] You showed yourself up.
[2886.28 → 2890.74] You went leaping and dancing in front of all those servant girls.
[2891.36 → 2894.04] David says, I was leaping and dancing before the Lord.
[2894.04 → 2900.62] Leaping and dancing before God.
[2904.44 → 2910.96] I remember years ago, some of you remember, I worked before we were here, before I was married.
[2911.22 → 2913.30] I worked in Papua New Guinea for five years.
[2913.30 → 2927.50] And while I was in Papua New Guinea, I had the privilege of serving for three of those five years in a village, a very remote village, with a group of people known as the Guhusamani people.
[2928.46 → 2933.06] And it was a remote area, but they experienced a revival.
[2933.06 → 2944.30] And I'm going to tell you, I can honestly say, I have never, ever since experienced a worship experience like that.
[2945.20 → 2953.30] Here was a people with no microphones, no electric instruments at all.
[2954.30 → 2961.42] And I experienced singing like I have never, ever experienced it since.
[2961.42 → 2967.74] They would raise the roof off any building they were in.
[2968.14 → 2979.12] And all they played with was a bunch of acoustic guitars and people singing with such joy and such passion.
[2979.56 → 2982.56] Like I said, never have I experienced that since then.
[2982.82 → 2986.10] In, of all places, remote Papua New Guinea.
[2986.10 → 2992.48] And it was a joy to even be part of, honestly.
[2995.08 → 3010.48] I compare that with, and again, I'm going to be a little bit, critique a little bit here, but what I sometimes see in our modern, especially really modern contemporary worship with the band up front and a group, a team of singers loud.
[3010.48 → 3016.98] And then I look around some of these services and I see people chatting.
[3017.64 → 3018.58] Few people singing.
[3019.86 → 3023.04] Or if they are, they're not singing very much.
[3024.06 → 3024.88] Some aren't.
[3025.22 → 3025.70] Some are.
[3026.38 → 3027.50] Some are chatting.
[3028.56 → 3031.92] Some are checking their phones.
[3032.66 → 3034.20] Some are sipping coffee.
[3034.20 → 3034.32] Some are sipping coffee.
[3034.88 → 3037.70] And I'm thinking, this is a worship service?
[3038.96 → 3041.66] That's not what the psalmist describes.
[3042.46 → 3050.02] The psalmist calls for passionate, passionate, exuberant, joy-filled worship.
[3052.36 → 3056.18] And not only that, notice who he calls to worship.
[3057.18 → 3061.22] He says, shout for joy to the Lord.
[3061.22 → 3064.18] All the earth.
[3067.18 → 3068.94] The whole earth.
[3070.18 → 3074.70] All the peoples of the world are called to worship our God.
[3075.02 → 3079.26] Now, if you're familiar, you may be aware, the psalms, they have various sections.
[3079.26 → 3092.06] And most commentators see that the section from Psalm 93 through Psalm 100 are this set of royal or kingship psalms.
[3092.46 → 3093.26] The Lord reigns.
[3094.16 → 3095.26] The Lord is king.
[3095.72 → 3098.26] And you'll see that in so many of the psalms.
[3098.36 → 3100.26] We read Psalm 95 earlier.
[3100.26 → 3102.96] But it comes up over and over again.
[3103.16 → 3104.28] God's rule.
[3104.76 → 3105.50] God's reign.
[3105.94 → 3108.20] And it climaxes in Psalm 100.
[3108.80 → 3110.82] And it's interesting to follow the progression.
[3111.10 → 3118.50] Because at the beginning, it's sort of like telling the world that God reigns.
[3118.86 → 3119.60] He's in charge.
[3119.82 → 3121.26] Just sort of making the observation.
[3122.30 → 3123.76] And then sort of announcing it.
[3123.76 → 3128.06] But by the time you get to Psalm 100, the earth is invited in.
[3129.82 → 3130.26] Come.
[3131.20 → 3132.38] Shout for joy to the Lord.
[3132.52 → 3133.30] All the earth.
[3133.48 → 3135.14] You're all part of this now.
[3135.50 → 3142.40] And it's interesting to follow that crescendo of inclusion of all people.
[3142.66 → 3143.24] And it's a bit.
[3144.52 → 3147.02] The commentary is very like, what do we do with this song?
[3147.08 → 3148.84] Because notice it says, shout for joy to the Lord.
[3148.98 → 3149.82] All the earth.
[3149.96 → 3150.96] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[3151.04 → 3151.92] Come before him with songs.
[3151.92 → 3153.42] Know that the Lord is God.
[3153.74 → 3154.88] It is he who made us.
[3155.14 → 3156.38] We are his.
[3156.52 → 3157.28] We are his people.
[3157.52 → 3159.44] Oh, who's he talking about now there?
[3160.54 → 3162.90] Is he just talking about Israel?
[3163.56 → 3166.70] Or is he talking about all the earth?
[3167.96 → 3170.70] And commentators don't agree.
[3171.26 → 3173.36] Some say, no, no, now he's back to Israel.
[3173.72 → 3176.28] And others say, no, no, he's including the earth.
[3176.78 → 3178.94] And I'm not sure which it is.
[3178.94 → 3191.30] All I know is it would appear almost like the boundaries between the earth's people and God's chosen, at least originally Old Testament chosen people Israel.
[3191.70 → 3193.88] Those boundaries are being blurred.
[3195.88 → 3199.56] Second Chronicles chapter 6.
[3201.82 → 3204.78] Second Chronicles chapter 6.
[3204.78 → 3209.82] Verses 32 to 33.
[3211.24 → 3214.86] Solomon is praying a prayer of dedication for the temple.
[3215.42 → 3226.42] And he says in this prayer, if you read the whole thing, all about how, you know, if your people, if this happens, famine or drought or whatever, they can return to the temple and pray.
[3226.60 → 3228.10] And God will heal and all of that.
[3228.38 → 3229.82] And then he comes to verse 32.
[3229.82 → 3241.42] As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people, Israel, but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm,
[3241.78 → 3247.90] when they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place.
[3248.54 → 3250.42] Do whatever the foreigner asks of you.
[3250.42 → 3258.50] So that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you.
[3258.50 → 3265.90] As do your own people, Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your name.
[3266.12 → 3270.02] So that all the peoples of the earth may know you.
[3270.02 → 3272.18] And here it appears in Psalm 100.
[3272.34 → 3278.62] Again, the boundaries are kind of blurred between the peoples of the earth and God's chosen people.
[3279.06 → 3288.76] It's almost like, to use New Testament language, the anticipation of the peoples of the earth being grafted in to God's people.
[3289.18 → 3292.68] And to join in this exuberant praise.
[3293.42 → 3295.32] I think we see some of that this morning.
[3295.98 → 3297.18] As we're gathered here.
[3297.18 → 3308.68] The other thing to notice about this, though, is we tend to think of worship as this time when we gather in a holy huddle.
[3309.76 → 3312.54] And we, you know, this is our time.
[3313.32 → 3314.10] Team cheer.
[3315.56 → 3319.18] But worship is inherently evangelistic.
[3320.70 → 3323.54] Worship itself is outward focused.
[3323.54 → 3328.30] The peoples of the world are called to shout for joy to the Lord.
[3328.74 → 3329.52] All the earth.
[3331.40 → 3332.76] Worship is mission.
[3333.22 → 3334.30] It is outreach.
[3335.00 → 3336.64] It's not just for here.
[3336.98 → 3338.38] It's for the whole world.
[3340.38 → 3346.60] Exuberant joy shared by the world that so desperately needs joy.
[3346.60 → 3351.82] Hungers and needs real joy.
[3352.36 → 3355.42] Happy isn't really the best word.
[3355.88 → 3359.30] Joy is much richer, I think.
[3361.42 → 3364.30] And then, what are they called to do?
[3364.72 → 3369.60] As we said, the focus of this psalm is in their praise, in their joy.
[3369.60 → 3375.44] To know that the Lord, he is God.
[3376.42 → 3377.98] Now, to know something.
[3378.18 → 3378.92] It's interesting.
[3379.74 → 3385.20] The verb to know is actually not very often a command, an imperative.
[3385.42 → 3386.64] You're not, you know this.
[3387.96 → 3390.48] Usually, either you know it or you don't, right?
[3391.44 → 3393.90] We don't usually give a command to know something.
[3394.40 → 3396.14] And in Hebrew, it's the same, similar to English.
[3396.26 → 3396.82] You don't usually.
[3396.82 → 3399.42] It's rarely used in the Old Testament, but a few times.
[3400.04 → 3402.00] But here, it's this command.
[3402.88 → 3405.42] Know that the Lord, he is God.
[3405.72 → 3411.76] And it's, but to know is not mere mental assent.
[3412.60 → 3414.68] Just like you know a fact.
[3416.82 → 3419.64] Know is so much deeper than that.
[3420.10 → 3424.88] Know knowledge, real knowledge, is for all life.
[3424.88 → 3430.56] And it's a devotion, a commitment, a full commitment.
[3430.80 → 3438.54] It's interesting and instructive, I think, that the word know in Hebrew is the same word
[3438.54 → 3441.82] that's used for intimate marital relations.
[3443.00 → 3448.56] Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore a son.
[3448.56 → 3457.02] It's much deeper than just some kind of trivial pursuit.
[3458.02 → 3466.06] It's real knowledge, deep, intimate, all life knowledge.
[3466.06 → 3469.10] And what are we to know?
[3470.94 → 3473.84] The Lord, he is God.
[3473.92 → 3478.48] Now, I don't, the translations, I don't, didn't see how I put that in.
[3478.72 → 3481.42] Because in the Hebrew, it actually is emphatic.
[3481.58 → 3482.80] There's the pronoun is added.
[3483.74 → 3485.98] Lord, he, God.
[3486.24 → 3489.52] The Lord, he is God.
[3489.52 → 3491.62] And I think it's really important.
[3492.96 → 3493.48] Deuteronomy.
[3495.40 → 3496.48] Deuteronomy chapter 4.
[3496.56 → 3499.50] Because this same phrase comes up other points in the Old Testament.
[3499.86 → 3500.90] We're going to look at a couple of them.
[3501.26 → 3506.48] In Deuteronomy 4, verses 35 first.
[3507.74 → 3512.92] Notice what the Torah says here, the instruction.
[3512.92 → 3515.58] Deuteronomy 4, verse 35.
[3515.72 → 3521.46] You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord, he is God.
[3521.58 → 3523.02] It's the same group.
[3524.26 → 3526.34] Besides him, there is no other God.
[3527.74 → 3529.84] And then jump down to verse 39.
[3531.76 → 3540.66] Acknowledge, take heart this day, that, again, the Lord, he is God in heaven above and on earth below.
[3540.66 → 3542.80] There is no other.
[3542.92 → 3548.48] The Lord, he is God.
[3548.80 → 3551.04] Now, that same phrase comes up again.
[3551.66 → 3553.08] Some of you may remember it.
[3553.10 → 3558.94] In the story of Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel.
[3559.84 → 3562.16] Because you remember that they had this competition.
[3563.14 → 3567.52] And the prophets of Baal had the first go and trying to conjure up.
[3568.42 → 3569.98] They weren't allowed to light a fire.
[3569.98 → 3574.54] That their God, Baal, would light the fire for the sacrifice.
[3574.76 → 3575.98] And, of course, it doesn't happen.
[3576.08 → 3577.48] They go on throughout the day.
[3577.72 → 3578.28] It doesn't happen.
[3578.54 → 3582.82] Finally, at the time of the afternoon sacrifice, Elijah says, okay, let's do this now.
[3582.98 → 3584.86] And he takes the sacrifice.
[3585.08 → 3587.16] And they pour water all over it and everything.
[3587.36 → 3589.40] And then he cries out.
[3589.60 → 3590.50] And what happens?
[3590.50 → 3593.20] Fire from heaven comes down.
[3593.72 → 3595.66] And consumes everything.
[3595.66 → 3599.84] Do you remember what the people's response was?
[3600.28 → 3605.96] They fell down in worship, and they said, the Lord, he is God.
[3606.02 → 3606.76] Same phrase.
[3607.28 → 3608.24] And they said it twice.
[3608.68 → 3610.32] The Lord, he is God.
[3610.54 → 3613.02] The Lord, he is God.
[3613.02 → 3620.36] So there's no bland pluralism here.
[3620.54 → 3620.62] Okay?
[3620.72 → 3622.40] I mean, we live in a pluralistic culture.
[3622.58 → 3623.80] They did in the Old Testament, too.
[3623.86 → 3624.98] And they did in the New Testament.
[3625.32 → 3626.80] There are a lot of religions.
[3627.42 → 3632.42] And yet, the Bible calls to this exclusive confession.
[3633.06 → 3636.48] Only the Lord, he is God.
[3637.54 → 3640.68] Walter Brueggemann puts it this way.
[3640.68 → 3652.44] Quote, to praise is to reject alternative loyalties and false definitions of reality.
[3653.48 → 3657.46] Praise is relentlessly polemical.
[3659.60 → 3660.72] Close quote.
[3661.42 → 3664.34] Praise is relentlessly polemical.
[3664.34 → 3671.60] The Lord, he, and you could say, he alone is God.
[3672.24 → 3677.04] I like the way the message actually translates those verses in Deuteronomy.
[3677.48 → 3678.82] Because they put it this way.
[3679.30 → 3681.28] You saw the NIV translation.
[3682.30 → 3687.28] But this is the way Eugene Peterson translated it in the two verses from Deuteronomy.
[3687.28 → 3695.66] You were shown all this so that you would know that God is, well, God.
[3696.40 → 3698.26] He's the only God there is.
[3699.22 → 3699.94] He's it.
[3701.34 → 3702.46] And then verse 39.
[3703.00 → 3704.28] Know this well, then.
[3704.88 → 3706.78] Take it to heart right now.
[3707.34 → 3708.68] God is in heaven above.
[3709.36 → 3710.88] God is on the earth below.
[3711.42 → 3714.82] He's the only God there is.
[3714.82 → 3717.90] And I think that captures it.
[3718.24 → 3721.72] The Lord, he is God.
[3723.92 → 3729.52] Now, Augustine, when he comments on this psalm, and he talks about it in his confessions, actually.
[3729.86 → 3738.30] And he makes the point that this calling the Lord, he is God, and this call to shout for joy to the Lord all the earth,
[3738.30 → 3755.20] to give praise to God, is a call to not worship the earth, the sun, the stars, the kinds of things that people in his day did worship.
[3755.20 → 3766.92] Now, we don't get into that as much, although sometimes I wonder if we border on, in some cases, sort of divinization of the earth.
[3768.92 → 3777.76] But the earth is only part of creation, and all the earth is called to shout for joy to the Lord,
[3777.76 → 3782.32] and to know that he, he alone is God.
[3783.64 → 3787.08] Now, the Lord, he is God.
[3788.08 → 3792.30] And then remember what the New Testament confession is.
[3793.24 → 3800.24] Because there's one early, really first confession before a Nicene Creed or an Apostles Creed.
[3800.24 → 3806.96] I'm not dissing those at all, but before we had those, the first real confession was simply,
[3808.34 → 3810.48] Jesus is Lord.
[3812.56 → 3815.38] Romans 10, verse 9.
[3816.50 → 3818.42] You probably, you're familiar with this.
[3819.04 → 3822.56] If you, I like confess better, if you confess with your mouth,
[3823.04 → 3824.76] Jesus is Lord.
[3825.10 → 3829.46] And believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[3829.46 → 3833.10] And that confession comes up again in 1 Corinthians 12, for example.
[3833.60 → 3834.54] Jesus is Lord.
[3834.80 → 3839.68] Now, we're used to hearing that, but you have to understand that in their day and age,
[3840.44 → 3845.42] the confession on most people's mouths was,
[3846.44 → 3848.04] Caesar is Lord.
[3849.78 → 3852.28] And to say, Jesus is Lord,
[3853.18 → 3856.58] was to come into immediate conflict with that confession.
[3856.58 → 3859.82] Who really is Lord.
[3860.58 → 3863.02] And it was a dangerous thing for Christians to say.
[3863.34 → 3866.18] And they died for it, and they suffered for it.
[3866.92 → 3869.04] But that continues to be the confession.
[3869.18 → 3869.86] Now, it's interesting.
[3870.90 → 3872.48] The Lord, he is God.
[3873.38 → 3876.16] Jesus is Lord.
[3876.16 → 3887.22] We know God best
[3887.22 → 3890.62] through Jesus, his son.
[3892.00 → 3894.94] He's the one by which we know
[3894.94 → 3896.66] that the Lord, he is God.
[3897.80 → 3899.12] Because his son,
[3899.64 → 3901.20] his son came
[3901.20 → 3903.32] and lived and died
[3903.32 → 3904.54] and rose again
[3904.54 → 3905.78] and is coming again.
[3906.78 → 3908.78] The Lord, he is God.
[3909.58 → 3911.22] Jesus is Lord.
[3911.94 → 3914.46] The other thing that I think comes out in this psalm
[3914.46 → 3920.90] is the sense of our total dependence on God.
[3920.90 → 3924.80] Know that the Lord,
[3925.28 → 3926.34] he is God.
[3926.74 → 3928.96] It's he who made us.
[3929.98 → 3931.44] We are his.
[3932.16 → 3933.34] We are his people
[3933.34 → 3936.18] and the sheep of his pasture,
[3936.32 → 3937.76] the flock under his care.
[3938.74 → 3939.72] We are his.
[3941.78 → 3944.06] Now, that's meant to be a comfort.
[3945.02 → 3946.04] Ultimately, it is.
[3946.04 → 3949.78] Because in spite of everything that happens
[3949.78 → 3950.82] and all that goes on
[3950.82 → 3951.52] in our own lives
[3951.52 → 3952.48] and around the world,
[3953.40 → 3954.22] he's God
[3954.22 → 3956.34] and we are his.
[3957.58 → 3960.02] And you can rest in that.
[3964.04 → 3966.64] Because at the end of the psalm,
[3967.28 → 3968.00] how is he described?
[3968.84 → 3969.92] He's good.
[3969.92 → 3975.16] His covenant, faithful, steadfast love
[3975.16 → 3975.88] is chased,
[3976.16 → 3977.30] endures forever,
[3977.56 → 3978.34] is forever.
[3979.16 → 3980.94] And his faithfulness
[3980.94 → 3982.94] is for all generations.
[3983.28 → 3983.96] He's good,
[3984.26 → 3985.02] he's loving,
[3985.38 → 3986.44] and he's faithful.
[3987.54 → 3988.72] And we are his.
[3991.62 → 3993.28] He's not like
[3993.28 → 3995.32] the other gods,
[3996.12 → 3996.72] little g.
[3996.72 → 3999.36] Because the other gods
[3999.36 → 4000.72] were almost
[4000.72 → 4002.58] totally unpredictable,
[4003.54 → 4004.32] capricious.
[4005.68 → 4007.34] You never knew what to expect.
[4008.14 → 4009.48] You tried to placate them
[4009.48 → 4010.26] as much as possible,
[4010.36 → 4011.42] but they could turn on you
[4011.42 → 4012.24] in a minute,
[4012.64 → 4013.30] in a second.
[4015.16 → 4017.90] God is always loving,
[4018.22 → 4018.50] good,
[4019.02 → 4019.34] loving,
[4020.06 → 4020.86] and faithful.
[4022.56 → 4024.08] Now, I sense,
[4024.16 → 4025.16] we don't struggle as much
[4025.16 → 4027.04] maybe with the gods
[4027.04 → 4027.80] in the sense
[4027.80 → 4028.92] of the ancient world.
[4029.92 → 4031.14] But I really sense,
[4031.34 → 4033.92] and certainly in our modern context
[4033.92 → 4035.46] in the West,
[4036.56 → 4037.52] that the sense
[4037.52 → 4038.96] of our dependence on God
[4038.96 → 4041.68] is almost gone.
[4042.72 → 4044.22] People don't sense.
[4044.28 → 4045.34] I think we're comfortable,
[4045.74 → 4046.58] we've got it good,
[4047.02 → 4047.56] relatively,
[4048.20 → 4050.08] and people don't see
[4050.08 → 4051.84] their need for God anymore.
[4051.84 → 4053.96] that we really,
[4054.24 → 4055.78] utterly depend on him.
[4056.10 → 4057.86] We are his people,
[4059.42 → 4061.02] his flock,
[4061.50 → 4062.56] his sheep.
[4064.34 → 4066.40] But very few recognize
[4066.40 → 4067.02] that anymore,
[4067.48 → 4068.94] or less and less,
[4069.54 → 4070.26] I would say.
[4071.12 → 4072.14] I don't know what it's going to take
[4072.14 → 4073.56] to wake people up
[4073.56 → 4074.72] to their need.
[4075.12 → 4076.38] Because depending on
[4076.38 → 4077.40] ourselves,
[4078.04 → 4079.90] I think is just naive,
[4080.26 → 4081.48] naive optimism.
[4081.48 → 4084.48] that fills so much
[4084.48 → 4084.74] of, say,
[4084.80 → 4085.72] secular humanism
[4085.72 → 4086.26] and the like.
[4087.36 → 4088.06] But we have
[4088.06 → 4089.62] this self-reliant
[4089.62 → 4090.44] independence,
[4091.00 → 4092.12] this false sense
[4092.12 → 4092.88] of security.
[4093.84 → 4095.30] And we so quickly
[4095.30 → 4095.80] forget God.
[4095.88 → 4095.98] Now,
[4096.08 → 4096.80] we were reminded
[4096.80 → 4097.36] of this,
[4097.74 → 4098.12] again,
[4098.66 → 4099.80] being back in Malaysia
[4099.80 → 4101.64] for Jenny and me.
[4101.68 → 4102.06] Because it was
[4102.06 → 4103.98] not just a joy
[4103.98 → 4104.64] to be back with him,
[4104.68 → 4105.70] but it was spiritually
[4105.70 → 4106.86] refreshing.
[4106.86 → 4108.72] because we met
[4108.72 → 4109.84] a people who,
[4110.26 → 4110.76] again,
[4110.86 → 4111.92] or we reconnected
[4111.92 → 4112.50] with a people
[4112.50 → 4113.62] who face
[4113.62 → 4114.92] all kinds of challenges.
[4115.14 → 4115.30] I mean,
[4115.36 → 4116.08] they live
[4116.08 → 4117.18] in a
[4117.54 → 4118.58] at times,
[4118.70 → 4119.74] oppressive
[4119.74 → 4121.28] situation.
[4121.54 → 4122.08] They live with
[4122.08 → 4123.42] a Muslim majority
[4123.42 → 4124.74] government
[4124.74 → 4126.84] that is,
[4126.84 → 4127.98] I was at,
[4128.12 → 4128.92] I spoke at
[4128.92 → 4129.54] one of the
[4129.54 → 4130.36] NECK,
[4130.44 → 4130.80] which is like
[4130.80 → 4131.54] their National
[4131.54 → 4132.18] Association of
[4132.18 → 4133.38] Evangelicals,
[4133.38 → 4135.92] in Kuala Lumpur.
[4136.02 → 4136.34] We were there
[4136.34 → 4136.98] for about a week.
[4137.30 → 4137.88] And I shared
[4137.88 → 4138.48] at one of their
[4138.48 → 4139.52] pastors' gatherings,
[4140.26 → 4141.50] pastors all
[4141.50 → 4142.08] with,
[4142.34 → 4142.94] who speak
[4142.94 → 4144.30] in Malay language.
[4144.30 → 4146.18] and so I was
[4146.18 → 4146.80] sharing there.
[4147.32 → 4147.76] Afterwards,
[4147.94 → 4148.44] one of the head
[4148.44 → 4149.04] guys from
[4149.04 → 4150.28] the Association
[4150.28 → 4151.14] of Evangelicals
[4151.14 → 4151.58] got up.
[4152.38 → 4153.12] And he said,
[4153.68 → 4154.32] he was speaking
[4154.32 → 4154.64] to them,
[4154.68 → 4155.08] and he said,
[4155.24 → 4156.06] I need to remind
[4156.06 → 4156.36] you,
[4156.76 → 4157.06] pastors,
[4158.10 → 4159.90] someone is
[4159.90 → 4161.02] always watching
[4161.02 → 4161.34] you.
[4162.38 → 4162.88] The special
[4162.88 → 4163.34] branch
[4163.34 → 4165.28] is always
[4165.28 → 4166.32] watching you.
[4166.38 → 4167.02] They are sending
[4167.02 → 4167.76] in spies
[4167.76 → 4168.98] into your
[4168.98 → 4169.98] ...
[4169.98 → 4170.98] ...
[4170.98 → 4171.98] ...
[4171.98 → 4172.98] ...
[4172.98 → 4175.16] into your
[4175.16 → 4175.64] services.
[4176.18 → 4177.08] They are watching
[4177.08 → 4177.32] you.
[4177.42 → 4177.78] They're sending
[4177.78 → 4178.94] in false
[4178.94 → 4179.54] converts
[4179.54 → 4180.74] to try and
[4180.74 → 4181.42] catch you
[4181.42 → 4182.50] proselytizing.
[4183.50 → 4184.16] And we're
[4184.16 → 4184.48] seeing,
[4184.70 → 4185.26] we've had pastors
[4185.26 → 4186.04] go missing
[4186.04 → 4186.62] there,
[4186.90 → 4187.58] or they're
[4187.58 → 4188.44] imprisoned for
[4188.44 → 4188.96] a time.
[4189.32 → 4190.02] They live
[4190.02 → 4190.62] under that
[4190.62 → 4191.58] all the time.
[4193.28 → 4194.40] And yet,
[4195.32 → 4197.58] their joy
[4197.58 → 4198.06] and their
[4198.06 → 4198.72] dependence on
[4198.72 → 4199.60] God was
[4199.60 → 4200.30] palpable.
[4201.20 → 4201.84] And it was
[4201.84 → 4202.30] like we were
[4202.30 → 4202.74] in these
[4202.74 → 4203.34] contexts,
[4203.76 → 4205.16] and let's
[4205.16 → 4205.44] pray.
[4206.80 → 4207.54] We need to
[4207.54 → 4207.98] ask God
[4207.98 → 4208.40] into this.
[4208.48 → 4208.92] We need to
[4208.92 → 4209.54] seek God's
[4209.54 → 4209.72] will.
[4210.14 → 4210.52] And they
[4210.52 → 4211.18] prayed.
[4211.36 → 4211.74] I haven't
[4211.74 → 4212.36] prayed that
[4212.36 → 4213.28] much in a
[4213.28 → 4213.52] long,
[4213.74 → 4213.94] long time
[4213.94 → 4216.30] because they
[4216.30 → 4217.28] just know
[4217.28 → 4218.36] that they
[4218.36 → 4219.70] desperately need
[4219.70 → 4220.50] to rely on
[4220.50 → 4220.90] God.
[4222.68 → 4223.30] I was
[4223.30 → 4223.84] reminded this
[4223.84 → 4224.48] again just
[4224.48 → 4224.82] recently.
[4224.94 → 4225.32] I was staying
[4225.32 → 4226.36] with a
[4226.36 → 4227.20] family in
[4227.20 → 4228.04] another church
[4228.04 → 4228.62] I was speaking
[4228.62 → 4229.14] at, and I
[4229.14 → 4229.66] had to stay
[4229.66 → 4230.32] overnight, so I
[4230.32 → 4230.64] stayed with
[4230.64 → 4231.92] them, dealing
[4231.92 → 4232.88] with cancer in
[4232.88 → 4233.46] their midst.
[4233.74 → 4234.38] Had a
[4234.38 → 4235.06] cancer and it
[4235.06 → 4236.50] recurred, and
[4236.50 → 4237.66] now again, and
[4237.66 → 4238.44] fighting that
[4238.44 → 4238.86] cancer.
[4239.28 → 4239.76] But I have to
[4239.76 → 4240.92] say, staying with
[4240.92 → 4241.80] that family, even
[4241.80 → 4242.76] just overnight and
[4242.76 → 4244.72] the next day, the
[4244.72 → 4245.32] depth of
[4245.32 → 4246.20] spirituality in
[4246.20 → 4246.98] them was
[4246.98 → 4247.68] incredible.
[4248.20 → 4248.84] And I was
[4248.84 → 4249.36] enriched.
[4249.86 → 4250.34] We said we
[4250.34 → 4251.90] prayed together as
[4251.90 → 4252.46] I was leaving.
[4252.86 → 4254.50] I was built up by
[4254.50 → 4255.60] their, now it
[4255.60 → 4256.34] doesn't always work
[4256.34 → 4256.74] that way, I
[4256.74 → 4257.16] know it can
[4257.16 → 4257.80] push people
[4257.80 → 4258.70] away, but it
[4258.70 → 4259.60] can also draw
[4259.60 → 4260.52] them closer to
[4260.52 → 4261.56] God because they
[4261.56 → 4263.14] desperately needed
[4263.14 → 4263.94] God and they
[4263.94 → 4264.50] knew it.
[4266.56 → 4267.68] Do we live
[4267.68 → 4268.40] that kind of
[4268.40 → 4270.70] dependence, with
[4270.70 → 4271.10] that kind of
[4271.10 → 4271.74] dependence on
[4271.74 → 4272.10] God?
[4273.40 → 4274.60] We need him
[4274.60 → 4276.28] because the
[4276.28 → 4277.86] Lord, he is
[4277.86 → 4278.32] God.
[4279.58 → 4280.54] Know this.
[4281.32 → 4281.78] Would you bow
[4281.78 → 4282.16] with me in
[4282.16 → 4282.36] prayer?
[4282.36 → 4284.14] Father, we
[4284.14 → 4284.82] thank you for
[4284.82 → 4286.14] the reminder
[4286.14 → 4288.76] that we
[4288.76 → 4291.26] need you.
[4292.30 → 4293.82] That we are
[4293.82 → 4294.38] yours.
[4295.36 → 4296.16] You are the
[4296.16 → 4296.68] creator.
[4297.76 → 4298.40] We are just
[4298.40 → 4299.34] part of this
[4299.34 → 4300.38] creation, this
[4300.38 → 4301.12] good creation
[4301.12 → 4301.58] that you've
[4301.58 → 4301.80] made.
[4303.88 → 4305.14] Lord, thank
[4305.14 → 4306.30] you that we
[4306.30 → 4307.42] can celebrate
[4307.42 → 4308.76] joyfully,
[4309.34 → 4311.68] with exuberance,
[4312.36 → 4315.76] we can sing,
[4316.24 → 4317.12] we can dance,
[4317.42 → 4318.28] we can leap
[4318.28 → 4319.94] with joy before
[4319.94 → 4322.02] you, our
[4322.02 → 4323.06] great and
[4323.06 → 4323.76] mighty God.
[4325.76 → 4327.18] Father, encourage
[4327.18 → 4328.60] us and guide
[4328.60 → 4329.74] us in our
[4329.74 → 4330.92] worship, in
[4330.92 → 4331.46] all of our
[4331.46 → 4332.82] lives, and we
[4332.82 → 4333.52] ask this in
[4333.52 → 4334.22] Jesus' name.
[4334.80 → 4335.18] Amen.
[4336.40 → 4337.70] We're going to
[4337.70 → 4339.42] sing now, and
[4339.42 → 4340.28] Mel and I had a
[4340.28 → 4340.88] bit of go-around
[4340.88 → 4342.34] on what song
[4342.34 → 4343.20] to sing as a
[4343.20 → 4343.58] song of
[4343.58 → 4344.56] response, because
[4344.56 → 4346.12] there's actually
[4346.12 → 4347.04] an old classic
[4347.04 → 4348.66] on Psalm 100,
[4348.82 → 4350.18] but it's kind
[4350.18 → 4350.50] of old.
[4351.10 → 4351.98] And so we
[4351.98 → 4352.18] were going,
[4352.30 → 4352.88] eh, that's
[4352.88 → 4353.24] not going to
[4353.24 → 4353.80] work, and we
[4353.80 → 4354.54] were debating,
[4354.76 → 4355.08] and I wanted
[4355.08 → 4356.20] to do the
[4356.20 → 4357.48] popular, there
[4357.48 → 4357.98] was an old
[4357.98 → 4359.14] chorus, but
[4359.14 → 4360.04] he said, nah,
[4360.10 → 4360.56] nobody knows
[4360.56 → 4360.74] that.
[4360.82 → 4361.06] And I'm like,
[4361.12 → 4361.50] okay.
[4362.04 → 4362.38] And we were
[4362.38 → 4362.78] kind of going
[4362.78 → 4363.34] back and
[4363.34 → 4363.80] forth, trying
[4363.80 → 4364.30] to figure this
[4364.30 → 4364.50] out.
[4364.92 → 4366.02] And finally, as
[4366.02 → 4366.68] I was going
[4366.68 → 4367.08] through the
[4367.08 → 4367.50] Psalms, I
[4367.50 → 4367.82] was reading
[4367.82 → 4368.74] through Psalm 93,
[4368.74 → 4369.48] right through
[4369.48 → 4370.76] 100 a couple
[4370.76 → 4371.42] of times, and
[4371.42 → 4372.86] going, and it
[4372.86 → 4373.50] kind of struck
[4373.50 → 4375.18] me, hey, the
[4375.18 → 4376.30] same phrase,
[4376.52 → 4377.16] shout for joy
[4377.16 → 4377.84] to the Lord,
[4378.00 → 4378.94] is used in
[4378.94 → 4379.78] Psalm 98.
[4381.48 → 4382.64] It's Psalm 98,
[4382.70 → 4383.18] verse 4.
[4383.54 → 4384.34] Again, they
[4384.34 → 4385.18] usually translate
[4385.18 → 4385.78] make a joyful
[4385.78 → 4386.34] noise to the
[4386.34 → 4386.48] Lord.
[4386.60 → 4387.24] It's shout for
[4387.24 → 4387.68] joy to the
[4387.68 → 4387.96] Lord, all
[4387.96 → 4388.42] there, same
[4388.42 → 4388.82] phrase.
[4389.46 → 4390.50] And Psalm 98
[4390.50 → 4391.86] is actually the
[4391.86 → 4392.60] main, the
[4392.60 → 4394.38] foundation for
[4394.38 → 4395.80] that Christmas
[4395.80 → 4396.60] hymn we sing,
[4397.12 → 4397.74] Joy to the
[4397.74 → 4397.98] World.
[4398.10 → 4398.54] It's actually
[4398.54 → 4399.68] just Psalm 98,
[4399.92 → 4401.20] and that's
[4401.20 → 4402.12] sort of the
[4402.12 → 4402.70] main part of
[4402.70 → 4402.84] it.
[4403.50 → 4403.94] And so I
[4403.94 → 4404.26] said, why
[4404.26 → 4404.70] do we sing
[4404.70 → 4405.40] Psalm 98?
[4406.18 → 4407.76] Or Joy to
[4407.76 → 4408.10] the World?
[4408.22 → 4408.42] And he
[4408.42 → 4408.76] said, yeah,
[4408.78 → 4409.08] let's do
[4409.08 → 4409.46] that, just
[4409.46 → 4409.88] if you tell
[4409.88 → 4410.12] them why
[4410.12 → 4410.46] we're singing
[4410.46 → 4410.68] that.
[4411.10 → 4411.72] So I'm
[4411.72 → 4412.26] telling you,
[4412.36 → 4412.64] and we're
[4412.64 → 4412.84] going to
[4412.84 → 4413.42] rise, and
[4413.42 → 4413.66] we're going
[4413.66 → 4414.66] to sing, and
[4414.66 → 4416.04] let's really
[4416.04 → 4416.82] shout for
[4416.82 → 4417.30] joy to the
[4417.30 → 4417.48] Lord.
[4427.74 → 4439.38] joy to the
[4439.38 → 4441.12] world, the
[4441.12 → 4442.66] Lord is
[4442.66 → 4444.48] come, let
[4444.48 → 4446.06] earth for
[4446.06 → 4447.70] save our
[4447.70 → 4449.86] games.
[4450.52 → 4451.00] Let
[4451.00 → 4452.16] every
[4452.16 → 4453.74] world
[4453.74 → 4454.44] be
[4454.44 → 4456.16] better and
[4456.16 → 4458.08] grow, and
[4458.08 → 4458.92] heaven and
[4458.92 → 4460.70] nature sing,
[4461.24 → 4462.70] heaven and
[4462.70 → 4464.42] nature sing,
[4464.98 → 4465.54] and
[4465.54 → 4467.58] heaven and
[4467.58 → 4468.36] nature
[4468.36 → 4472.62] sing.
[4472.62 → 4476.26] joy to
[4476.26 → 4478.26] the
[4478.26 → 4479.52] Saviour
[4479.52 → 4481.76] reigns,
[4481.76 → 4482.30] and
[4482.30 → 4482.90] all
[4482.90 → 4484.06] and
[4484.06 → 4484.10] all
[4484.10 → 4485.90] and
[4485.90 → 4486.10] all
[4486.10 → 4487.10] and
[4487.10 → 4488.10] all
[4488.10 → 4490.10] fields
[4490.10 → 4491.10] and
[4491.10 → 4492.10] floods
[4492.10 → 4493.00] and
[4493.00 → 4494.10] plains
[4494.10 → 4495.10] and
[4495.10 → 4496.10] plains
[4496.10 → 4497.10] repeat
[4497.10 → 4497.50] the
[4497.50 → 4497.98] sound
[4497.98 → 4498.48] and
[4498.48 → 4499.10] joy
[4499.10 → 4500.10] repeat
[4500.10 → 4501.10] the
[4501.10 → 4501.70] sound
[4501.70 → 4502.14] and
[4502.14 → 4502.98] joy
[4502.98 → 4504.26] repeat
[4504.26 → 4505.62] the
[4505.62 → 4507.78] sound
[4507.78 → 4508.98] and
[4508.98 → 4510.28] joy
[4510.28 → 4514.62] No
[4514.62 → 4515.66] more
[4515.66 → 4516.62] sin
[4516.62 → 4517.76] and
[4517.76 → 4518.82] sorrow
[4518.82 → 4520.46] grow
[4520.46 → 4521.36] nor
[4521.36 → 4522.86] thorns
[4522.86 → 4523.28] in
[4523.28 → 4524.72] face
[4524.72 → 4525.16] of
[4525.16 → 4526.98] blood
[4526.98 → 4528.68] He
[4528.68 → 4529.68] comes
[4529.68 → 4530.62] to
[4530.62 → 4532.50] his
[4532.50 → 4533.74] blessings
[4533.74 → 4535.68] go
[4535.68 → 4536.38] far
[4536.38 → 4536.88] as
[4536.88 → 4537.30] the
[4537.30 → 4537.80] curse
[4537.80 → 4538.28] is
[4538.28 → 4539.34] found
[4539.34 → 4540.26] far
[4540.26 → 4540.68] as
[4540.68 → 4541.14] the
[4541.14 → 4541.64] curse
[4541.64 → 4542.10] is
[4542.10 → 4543.14] found
[4543.14 → 4544.14] far
[4544.14 → 4545.52] as
[4545.52 → 4546.20] far
[4546.20 → 4547.60] as
[4547.60 → 4548.18] the
[4548.18 → 4549.14] curse
[4549.14 → 4550.20] is
[4550.20 → 4551.60] found
[4551.60 → 4552.68] man
[4552.68 → 4564.88] rose
[4565.44 → 4565.66] go
[4565.66 → 4565.82] in
[4565.82 → 4568.30] name
[4568.30 → 4580.64] He knows all each kingdom praise, and they serve nations free.
[4581.86 → 4597.78] The glories of His righteousness, and wonders of His love, and wonders of His love,
[4597.78 → 4607.22] and wonders of His love.
[4618.74 → 4624.34] At this time, we have the opportunity to honour God with our financial gifts,
[4624.34 → 4629.74] and as you might expect, today's contributions will go to the Seafarers Ministry.
[4630.18 → 4633.74] So I invite the deacons to come forward to take our offerings at this time.
[4633.74 → 4635.74] Thank you.

[4989.56 → 4994.56] I would invite you to rise and receive God's parting blessing.
[4994.56 → 5002.56] Hear these words of blessing.
[5002.56 → 5004.56] The Lord remembers us.
[5004.56 → 5006.56] The Lord remembers us and will bless us.
[5006.56 → 5008.56] He will bless his people Israel.
[5008.56 → 5010.56] He will bless the house of Aaron.
[5010.56 → 5016.56] He will bless those, all those who fear the Lord, small and great alike.
[5016.56 → 5022.56] May the Lord cause you to flourish both you and your children.

[5048.56 → 5050.56] They are promised.
[5050.56 → 5053.56] The Lord of Israel
[5053.56 → 5059.56] For he alone does want to ask for
[5059.56 → 5065.56] His glory is Jesus
[5065.56 → 5073.56] For he alone does want to ask for
[5073.56 → 5079.56] His glory is Jesus
