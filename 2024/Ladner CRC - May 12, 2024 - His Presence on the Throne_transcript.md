[339.44 --> 342.44]  Good morning to you all.
[342.44 --> 343.44]  Happy Mother's Day.
[343.44 --> 344.44]  Happy Mother's Day.
[344.44 --> 346.44]  Happy Ascension Day.
[346.44 --> 347.44]  As well.
[347.44 --> 349.44]  I know that's another big one on your minds.
[349.44 --> 356.52]  the day that our Lord ascended into heaven, and that's what we'll be focusing on throughout the service,
[356.62 --> 359.22]  and our readings, our prayers, and the sermon as well.
[360.54 --> 367.22]  So, again, welcome. My name is Jason Truel. I'm the pastor here, along with Pastor Nancy of our Chinese ministry.
[368.24 --> 371.70]  And if you are new with us today, we especially welcome you.
[371.76 --> 375.16]  We're so glad that you are here with us to worship the Lord together.
[375.16 --> 384.14]  And before we begin our time of worship, there are just two quick announcements that I want to draw your attention to.
[384.22 --> 394.20]  Right on the front of your bulletin, you'll see that today, at 2 o'clock, we will be singing at Mountain View Manor here in Ladner.
[394.58 --> 404.72]  So if you'd like to go and sing, you can talk to Marion, and I'm sure she'd welcome all of us, as many of us as we can, to go and sing at 2 o'clock.
[406.02 --> 414.18]  As well, Tuesday is our seniors' bus trip. I was invited last week, so I'm very excited. I'll be going.
[414.86 --> 419.82]  I think maybe there's still time to sign up. I don't know, but you can talk to Joan about that.
[420.66 --> 426.38]  Then, actually, this Friday coming up is the South Delta Concert of Prayer.
[426.38 --> 431.74]  So many of the churches in the South Delta will be gathering Friday evening.
[431.92 --> 435.56]  It's being hosted at Sacred Heart Parish.
[436.24 --> 445.06]  And we will be coming together as different churches to pray for our city, for the people of our city, for families, for different things.
[445.06 --> 451.04]  And so that will be a time of prayer, and I encourage as many of you as can to come and join us for that.
[452.80 --> 454.86]  So that is all for the announcements for now.
[456.00 --> 459.06]  So we come now before the Lord, and we come to worship Him.
[459.06 --> 464.84]  And so what we're doing this morning is actually we are beginning a conversation with the Lord.
[465.56 --> 467.66]  We're beginning a conversation with the Lord.
[468.06 --> 470.84]  And because we believe as Christians that when we come to worship,
[471.42 --> 477.62]  it's not only that we come to give God His due to worship Him as He deserves to be worshiped,
[477.62 --> 482.90]  but actually we also come to fellowship with Him and to hear from Him.
[484.32 --> 491.14]  And so I want to ask you a question, which is what are your expectations when you come to worship?
[491.96 --> 494.12]  What are your expectations this morning?
[495.20 --> 497.48]  Are you ready to speak to God?
[499.40 --> 502.86]  Are you ready to listen to God?
[502.86 --> 508.46]  Because that's what's going on, right?
[508.52 --> 511.86]  There is a divine conversation that we are about to begin.
[512.56 --> 516.20]  And we also believe as Christians that God always initiates, right?
[516.24 --> 520.80]  God always has the first word in our relationship with Him.
[521.68 --> 527.24]  And then we as people, as His people, we respond by listening, and we respond in obedience.
[528.12 --> 531.46]  And so let's first hear God's word to us in this call to worship.
[531.46 --> 536.42]  And hear the Lord call you to worship Him.
[537.84 --> 542.98]  And again, I'll begin, and then when it has the double arrow, I'll ask you to say it together with me.
[544.10 --> 544.80]  Philippians 2.
[545.60 --> 552.14]  God exalted Jesus to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name,
[552.14 --> 561.06]  that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[561.60 --> 569.10]  and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[570.10 --> 575.34]  Please join me as we respond to God's call by praising Him in a prayer of adoration.
[575.58 --> 576.18]  Let's pray together.
[576.18 --> 606.16]  Let's pray together.
[606.18 --> 607.28]  And we praise you.
[607.36 --> 608.34]  We worship you, Lord.
[608.34 --> 612.72]  We thank you that our Lord Jesus is seated on His throne.
[613.54 --> 617.70]  We pray that He would enjoy the praises of His people this morning.
[618.72 --> 625.84]  And would you be glorified in all that we together this morning say and do and think and feel and believe.
[625.84 --> 630.34]  For Christ's name and for His glory we pray.
[630.80 --> 631.12]  Amen.
[632.32 --> 634.22]  So brothers and sisters, let's stand.
[635.34 --> 640.00]  And as God has called us and we respond in worship and He greets us with these words,
[640.00 --> 649.00]  God placed all things under the feet of Jesus and appointed Him to be head over everything for the church,
[649.00 --> 655.56]  which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.
[656.66 --> 661.46]  Friends, as God has called us and He's greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[661.46 --> 663.96]  He's called us to be together as the church.
[663.96 --> 665.12]  Amen.
[665.12 --> 666.34]  Amen.
[666.34 --> 666.58]  Amen.
[666.58 --> 667.08]  Amen.
[667.08 --> 667.26]  Amen.
[668.06 --> 668.10]  Amen.
[668.38 --> 668.72]  Amen.
[668.72 --> 668.94]  Amen.
[681.08 --> 681.48]  Amen.
[681.54 --> 682.30]  Amen.
[682.30 --> 682.72]  Amen.
[682.72 --> 682.78]  Amen.
[682.78 --> 682.98]  Amen.
[682.98 --> 684.14]  Amen.
[684.14 --> 685.26]  Amen.
[685.26 --> 685.46]  Amen.
[686.30 --> 687.92]  Amen.
[688.08 --> 688.60]  Amen.
[688.78 --> 690.28]  Amen.
[690.28 --> 690.64]  Amen.
[691.06 --> 691.76]  Amen.
[691.76 --> 692.46]  Amen.
[692.46 --> 692.74]  Amen.
[692.74 --> 694.74]  Amen.
[722.74 --> 732.62]  Jesus shall reign forever the sun,
[732.62 --> 740.88]  does his circumstances in daily trial.
[740.88 --> 748.88]  His kingdom stretched from shore to shore,
[748.88 --> 758.88]  till whom shall rise and set forth.
[758.88 --> 767.88]  和如果彷徨之明,
[767.88 --> 776.88]  共享主儿歌声不停,
[776.88 --> 784.88]  迎看夜来同声赞美,
[784.88 --> 794.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[794.88 --> 824.88] 
[824.88 --> 834.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[834.88 --> 844.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[844.88 --> 848.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[848.88 --> 858.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[858.88 --> 866.88]  祈祷重用救助生命.
[866.88 --> 874.88]  天使不停歌声欢喜.
[874.88 --> 883.12]  Dishamon victory, amen.
[904.88 --> 906.88]  Amen.
[934.88 --> 936.88]  Amen.
[964.88 --> 966.88]  Amen.
[994.88 --> 996.88]  Amen.
[1024.88 --> 1026.88]  Amen.
[1054.88 --> 1055.88]  Amen.
[1061.88 --> 1062.74]  Please be seated.
[1079.92 --> 1084.44]  Our Old Testament reading this morning is from Psalm 47.
[1084.88 --> 1086.64]  And we'll read verses 1 to 8.
[1087.62 --> 1089.00]  So if you'd like to follow along.
[1102.06 --> 1106.60]  We may want to close that door and open that one if we want airflow.
[1108.90 --> 1110.28]  Someone is mowing their lawn.
[1111.50 --> 1112.02]  Thanks.
[1112.02 --> 1112.82]  All right.
[1112.82 --> 1114.02]  So Psalm 47.
[1114.68 --> 1116.34]  It's on page 422.
[1117.24 --> 1119.74]  422 in your pew Bible if you'd like to follow along.
[1120.64 --> 1124.94]  So this is a great hymn that is appropriate today on Ascension Sunday.
[1124.94 --> 1128.64]  Clap your hands, all you nations.
[1128.64 --> 1131.56]  Shout to God with cries of joy.
[1131.56 --> 1132.56]  How awesome is the Lord.
[1132.56 --> 1134.34]  How awesome is the Lord most high.
[1134.34 --> 1137.24]  The great king over all the earth.
[1137.48 --> 1141.68]  He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet.
[1142.32 --> 1144.32]  He chose our inheritance for us.
[1144.82 --> 1146.56]  The pride of Jacob whom he loved.
[1146.56 --> 1147.56]  God has ascended.
[1147.56 --> 1149.96]  God has ascended amidst shouts of joy.
[1149.96 --> 1152.92]  The Lord amidst the sounding of the trumpets.
[1152.92 --> 1154.82]  Sing praises to God.
[1154.82 --> 1155.74]  Sing praises.
[1155.74 --> 1157.94]  Sing praises to our king.
[1157.94 --> 1159.44]  Sing praises.
[1159.44 --> 1162.46]  For God is the king of all the earth.
[1162.46 --> 1164.88]  Sing to him a psalm of praise.
[1164.88 --> 1167.32]  God reigns over the nations.
[1167.32 --> 1170.14]  God is seated on his holy throne.
[1172.00 --> 1173.30]  In the last verse.
[1174.10 --> 1174.68]  Oh no, never mind.
[1174.72 --> 1175.12]  It's not there.
[1175.42 --> 1175.58]  Okay.
[1176.16 --> 1177.82]  So God reigns over the nations.
[1178.52 --> 1181.12]  God is seated on his holy throne.
[1185.36 --> 1188.76]  So now we come to our time of confession this morning.
[1189.66 --> 1193.82]  And it's a time when we come and we acknowledge that though God is on the throne,
[1193.82 --> 1197.22]  we often don't submit to him as king.
[1197.32 --> 1203.16]  We often like to crown ourselves as king and be the rulers of our own lives.
[1203.16 --> 1204.80]  We like to be the ones in control.
[1205.84 --> 1208.08]  But we acknowledge that God is on his throne.
[1208.24 --> 1209.14]  He is the king.
[1209.62 --> 1210.70]  We are his servants.
[1210.84 --> 1212.46]  We are his creatures.
[1212.58 --> 1213.22]  He made us.
[1213.92 --> 1215.48]  And so we also confess.
[1215.58 --> 1221.28]  It's the times that when we seek to usurp his throne in our lives.
[1221.74 --> 1223.42]  So I will lead us in a prayer.
[1223.96 --> 1226.94]  Then I will give you a time of silent confession.
[1227.32 --> 1233.50]  Where you can bring those things to mind which you want to bring to the Lord in confession.
[1233.74 --> 1235.12]  So please join me in this prayer.
[1235.12 --> 1244.84]  Lord, we acknowledge that you have given us a world of beauty and we have marred it.
[1244.84 --> 1250.30]  You have given us a world to feed and millions go hungry.
[1251.30 --> 1255.66]  You have given us a city to love and we have neglected it.
[1256.62 --> 1261.10]  You have given us families to care for and we have acted selfishly.
[1261.10 --> 1263.62]  You have given us a person.
[1263.62 --> 1266.24]  You have given us a person and we have not honored him.
[1267.28 --> 1272.96]  We humbly pray that you would forgive us in the merciful name of Jesus.
[1274.38 --> 1278.26]  So let's take some time now to silently confess our sins to God.
[1278.26 --> 1279.26]  Amen.
[1279.26 --> 1280.26]  Amen.
[1280.26 --> 1281.26]  Amen.
[1281.26 --> 1283.26]  Amen.
[1283.26 --> 1284.26]  Amen.
[1284.26 --> 1285.26]  Amen.
[1285.26 --> 1286.26]  Amen.
[1286.26 --> 1289.26]  Amen.
[1289.26 --> 1306.26]  The Lord looks on us with mercy.
[1306.26 --> 1312.66]  us with mercy. And it's because not of anything we have done, but it is because of what Christ
[1312.66 --> 1319.18]  has done for us. So brothers and sisters, hear these words of assurance from Hebrews chapter 4.
[1320.02 --> 1324.86]  And actually there'll be a part at the end where I'll have you say it with me. Hebrews chapter 4.
[1327.10 --> 1333.98]  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus, the Son of God,
[1333.98 --> 1341.12]  let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to
[1341.12 --> 1347.04]  empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are,
[1347.64 --> 1356.20]  yet he did not sin. Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may
[1356.20 --> 1363.96]  receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Brothers and sisters, know that
[1363.96 --> 1370.70]  your sins are forgiven and be at peace. So let's stand and let's sing of the forgiveness and the
[1370.70 --> 1377.38]  grace and the mercy that God has poured out upon us through our Lord Jesus Christ who sits on the throne.
[1377.38 --> 1377.46]  Amen.
[1393.96 --> 1395.96]  Amen.
[1395.96 --> 1419.90]  Amazing grace, how sweet the spell, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found,
[1419.90 --> 1427.90]  Was blind from now I see
[1427.90 --> 1436.90]  I was blind from now I see
[1436.90 --> 1444.90]  I was blind from now I see
[1444.90 --> 1452.90]  I was blind from now I see
[1452.90 --> 1460.90]  I was blind from now I see
[1460.90 --> 1468.90]  My chains are gone I live and free
[1468.90 --> 1476.90]  My God my Savior has ransomed me
[1476.90 --> 1484.90]  And like a flood his mercy reigns
[1484.90 --> 1494.90]  Unending love amazing grace
[1494.90 --> 1499.90]  The earth will both meet
[1499.90 --> 1500.90]  The world will lose
[1500.90 --> 1502.26]  The tide of man
[1502.26 --> 1504.90]  It will почти
[1504.90 --> 1506.30]  The拜es of the heart
[1506.30 --> 1507.90]  The earth will come
[1507.90 --> 1508.90]  To the foundation come
[1508.90 --> 1510.90]  The moon will receive
[1510.90 --> 1513.90]  theonstadtail
[1513.90 --> 1520.90]  O Lord, I will be to you, Jesus.
[1520.90 --> 1528.90]  Your Lord, I will be to you.
[1528.90 --> 1537.90]  When we've been there ten thousand years,
[1537.90 --> 1545.90]  Bright shining as the sun,
[1545.90 --> 1554.90]  We hope that it will speak God's praise,
[1554.90 --> 1563.90]  And when we've first begun.
[1563.90 --> 1568.90]  Sing you many plans for his freedom,
[1568.90 --> 1573.90]  Learning divine pure peace.
[1573.90 --> 1574.90]  Cause shelter,
[1574.90 --> 1580.90]  Your prayer is such a humandire necess idols.
[1580.90 --> 1584.90]  There is a tamamlu pussy vine,
[1584.90 --> 1591.62]  By every
[1591.62 --> 1596.04]  I am so, so I am too.
[1598.84 --> 1606.04]  My chains are gone, I'm in step three.
[1606.04 --> 1614.04]  My God, my Savior, has brought to me.
[1614.04 --> 1622.04]  And like the love, His mercy reigns.
[1623.32 --> 1630.46]  Amen, His love, amen, His grace.
[1644.04 --> 1645.04]  Amen.
[1658.90 --> 1662.38]  So as earlier we read that passage from Hebrews that said,
[1662.54 --> 1665.26]  let us hold firm to the faith that we profess.
[1665.82 --> 1669.70]  And one way that we do that is by reciting what we believe regularly.
[1670.10 --> 1673.22]  And we'll do that today with the words of the Apostles' Creed.
[1673.22 --> 1678.90]  This is a creed that binds us with other believers around the world throughout the ages
[1678.90 --> 1685.12]  in confessing the core truths of what we believe as Christians.
[1685.38 --> 1687.58]  And so let's say the Apostles' Creed together.
[1688.30 --> 1689.16]  Right now, ready?
[1690.14 --> 1695.68]  I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1696.34 --> 1700.54]  I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
[1700.54 --> 1705.80]  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1706.22 --> 1712.12]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1712.76 --> 1714.30]  He descended to hell.
[1715.00 --> 1718.06]  The third day He rose again from the dead.
[1718.62 --> 1724.54]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[1724.54 --> 1729.64]  From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1730.46 --> 1734.68]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,
[1735.34 --> 1739.20]  the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[1739.66 --> 1743.84]  the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1744.56 --> 1745.10]  Amen.
[1745.10 --> 1752.38]  So this table that we come to now,
[1753.02 --> 1756.50]  it is a meal that expresses our unity,
[1757.30 --> 1760.04]  not only with God through Jesus Christ,
[1760.54 --> 1765.10]  but also our unity with one another as His body, the church.
[1765.10 --> 1770.92]  And so, friends, that means that if you come and you recognize Jesus
[1770.92 --> 1773.50]  as the one who died for you,
[1774.10 --> 1777.84]  as the one who through His death and life forgives you,
[1778.42 --> 1781.04]  and sets you free from the bondage of sin and death,
[1781.66 --> 1783.14]  then this table is for you.
[1783.66 --> 1787.02]  And He has united you to Himself through Christ,
[1787.02 --> 1790.06]  and He has united all of us together
[1790.06 --> 1793.86]  through tearing down that wall of separation.
[1795.12 --> 1798.14]  This meal, then, expresses the love and the joy
[1798.14 --> 1799.84]  that we have as the body of Christ,
[1800.40 --> 1802.60]  as being reconciled to our Savior.
[1803.52 --> 1806.68]  But if you are here this morning and you don't believe,
[1807.36 --> 1808.96]  or you're not sure what you believe,
[1809.10 --> 1811.94]  you're not clear about who Jesus is and what He's done for you,
[1812.44 --> 1814.14]  then this table is not yet for you
[1814.14 --> 1816.96]  because you are not united to Him.
[1817.56 --> 1819.64]  And so we are so glad that you are here,
[1819.64 --> 1823.74]  and if you want to learn more about what Christianity is all about,
[1823.84 --> 1825.14]  I'd love for you to come and talk to me
[1825.14 --> 1826.86]  or come talk to Pastor Nancy.
[1828.04 --> 1831.92]  But even today, as the elements are handed out to you,
[1832.02 --> 1833.48]  please don't take them yet today,
[1834.02 --> 1836.86]  but wait until you can do so with true faith.
[1840.10 --> 1844.00]  So, hear now these words of institution.
[1846.70 --> 1848.54]  Brothers and sisters, the Lord Jesus,
[1848.54 --> 1850.02]  on the night when He was betrayed,
[1850.14 --> 1850.84]  He took bread,
[1851.28 --> 1852.96]  and when He had given thanks to God,
[1853.02 --> 1853.68]  He broke it.
[1854.30 --> 1854.72]  And He said,
[1854.78 --> 1856.58]  This is my body, which is for you.
[1857.22 --> 1859.32]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1860.46 --> 1861.36]  In the same way,
[1861.70 --> 1863.32]  after supper, He took the cup,
[1863.78 --> 1863.94]  saying,
[1864.04 --> 1865.44]  This cup is the new covenant
[1865.44 --> 1866.90]  in my blood.
[1866.90 --> 1871.28]  For as whenever you eat this cup,
[1871.28 --> 1872.30]  eat this bread,
[1872.54 --> 1873.92]  and you drink this cup,
[1874.38 --> 1876.12]  you proclaim the Lord's death
[1876.12 --> 1878.46]  until He comes again.
[1879.04 --> 1880.76]  And our Lord Jesus did promise
[1880.76 --> 1882.36]  that He would come again.
[1883.30 --> 1884.22]  So friends,
[1884.36 --> 1886.64]  these here are the gifts of God
[1886.64 --> 1887.46]  for you as people.
[1888.20 --> 1889.40]  He invites you
[1889.40 --> 1891.10]  to feed on Him
[1891.10 --> 1891.96]  by faith,
[1892.44 --> 1893.20]  with giving,
[1893.20 --> 1894.40]  knowing,
[1894.92 --> 1897.22]  that Christ has died for us.
[1898.14 --> 1898.58]  And so,
[1898.76 --> 1900.06]  let us prepare our hearts
[1900.06 --> 1900.66]  at this time
[1900.66 --> 1902.00]  and join me in a prayer
[1902.00 --> 1903.46]  to give thanks to God
[1903.46 --> 1904.96]  for these gifts of His.
[1905.00 --> 1905.38]  Let's pray.
[1906.54 --> 1907.66]  Our Heavenly Father,
[1907.80 --> 1909.04]  we thank you for the gifts
[1909.04 --> 1910.96]  of bread
[1910.96 --> 1912.68]  and the cup
[1912.68 --> 1914.18]  that remind us
[1914.18 --> 1915.38]  of the broken body
[1915.38 --> 1916.54]  and the shed blood
[1916.54 --> 1917.80]  of our Lord Jesus
[1917.80 --> 1919.14]  who gave His life
[1919.14 --> 1919.88]  freely
[1919.88 --> 1920.86]  and humbled Himself
[1920.86 --> 1921.48]  on the cross.
[1922.02 --> 1922.76]  And He did it
[1922.76 --> 1923.64]  so that we might,
[1924.04 --> 1924.96]  as we sang earlier,
[1925.06 --> 1925.84]  be set free,
[1926.50 --> 1927.52]  free from bondage,
[1927.66 --> 1928.38]  free from sin,
[1928.90 --> 1930.44]  free from the fear of death,
[1931.24 --> 1932.84]  and that we might be
[1932.84 --> 1934.72]  sons and daughters
[1934.72 --> 1935.84]  of the King.
[1936.80 --> 1937.26]  So Lord,
[1937.32 --> 1938.18]  we come gladly
[1938.18 --> 1939.50]  to your table this morning.
[1940.12 --> 1941.56]  We come as your children
[1941.56 --> 1943.20]  to receive
[1943.20 --> 1944.78]  from your hands,
[1945.14 --> 1946.02]  to receive freely
[1946.02 --> 1946.88]  by your grace.
[1947.32 --> 1949.44]  And would these elements
[1949.44 --> 1950.60]  be for us
[1950.60 --> 1951.38]  the very body
[1951.38 --> 1952.58]  and blood of Christ.
[1953.18 --> 1954.34]  And would you nourish us
[1954.34 --> 1954.98]  through this meal,
[1955.10 --> 1956.20]  we pray in Jesus' name.
[1956.66 --> 1956.90]  Amen.
[1958.14 --> 1959.48]  May I ask our elders
[1959.48 --> 1960.24]  to come forward
[1960.24 --> 1961.60]  and help to
[1961.60 --> 1962.58]  distribute the elements.
[1962.58 --> 1962.78]  Amen.
[1962.78 --> 1963.08]  Amen.

[2206.08 --> 2208.08]  Amen.
[2208.08 --> 2210.08]  Amen.
[2210.08 --> 2217.08]  Take, eat, remember and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken for us.
[2217.08 --> 2219.08]  Let's eat together.
[2234.08 --> 2236.08]  Amen.
[2264.08 --> 2266.08]  Amen.
[2267.08 --> 2271.08]  Amen.

[2454.12 --> 2459.36]  Take, drink, remember and believe that the blood of Christ was shed for you.
[2459.66 --> 2460.34]  Let's drink together.
[2468.12 --> 2469.12]  Amen.
[2471.12 --> 2472.12]  Please join me in prayer.
[2473.72 --> 2482.00]  God most high, we thank you for welcoming us, for laying this table before us, and feeding us by your grace.
[2482.68 --> 2490.36]  Lord, we deserve nothing from you, but in your great mercy, you have given us everything in your son, Jesus Christ.
[2490.36 --> 2503.00]  Lord, help us now by the power of your spirit at work within us to love you, to follow you faithfully, and to worship you as the risen and ascended king.
[2504.02 --> 2507.36]  Lord, bless us, we pray in Jesus' name.
[2507.72 --> 2508.02]  Amen.
[2508.02 --> 2509.02]  Amen.
[2515.02 --> 2522.10]  So this time, may I ask the children, invite the children, to come down and sit with me right up here.
[2522.10 --> 2523.10]  Amen.
[2523.10 --> 2524.10]  Amen.
[2538.02 --> 2549.58]  Good morning.
[2549.58 --> 2549.60]  Good morning.
[2549.60 --> 2563.80]  Come over here.
[2568.02 --> 2579.60]  Good morning.
[2580.18 --> 2580.94]  Would you like to wear this?
[2580.94 --> 2581.44]  No?
[2581.44 --> 2583.14]  Would it, it would look better on you, I said, right?
[2583.14 --> 2583.68]  No, okay.
[2583.68 --> 2584.74]  Would you like to wear this?
[2584.74 --> 2585.00]  No.
[2585.00 --> 2586.28]  Who would like to wear this?
[2586.28 --> 2586.70]  Anybody?
[2586.70 --> 2587.28]  It's a crown.
[2587.28 --> 2588.70]  Would you?
[2588.70 --> 2589.50]  No?
[2589.50 --> 2590.90]  Alright, I'll just have to keep wearing it then.
[2590.90 --> 2592.90]  Okay, there we go.
[2592.90 --> 2595.90]  So let's talk about this, a little bit more.
[2595.90 --> 2607.90]  there we go. So why am I wearing a crown? Who wears a crown? Your sister wears a crown.
[2608.66 --> 2615.46]  I bet she's an older sister. Younger than you. All right, who else wears a crown?
[2617.14 --> 2623.68]  A king, yeah. A king wears a crown, right? So if you are the king, you wear a crown.
[2623.68 --> 2632.32]  Or a queen. Yeah, you're right. So question, what does a king do?
[2635.06 --> 2642.44]  Who knows? What are some things a king does? Go ahead. He's the king. Yeah, that's right.
[2642.78 --> 2645.00]  And as the king, what does a king do?
[2645.00 --> 2658.38]  He rules, right, over a land and a people. He gives laws, right? Makes them laws for people to follow.
[2659.42 --> 2669.04]  He decides who is obeying the laws, and if they're not, then he punishes them. So he brings justice.
[2669.04 --> 2677.70]  And he protects the people from enemies, right? And so a king is important. And so what I want to do
[2677.70 --> 2681.06]  is share a verse from the Bible that says this.
[2681.06 --> 2694.24]  So God raised Jesus from the dead and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly realms,
[2694.36 --> 2700.16]  far above all rule and authority, power and dominion in every title that can be given,
[2700.68 --> 2706.32]  not only in the present age, but in the age to come. So you know how Jesus, he died on the cross,
[2706.32 --> 2714.88]  right? What happened? He rose from the dead. He became alive again. And then
[2714.88 --> 2726.24]  is that he became king. So Jesus is the king of all things. Did you know that? Jesus is the king.
[2726.92 --> 2732.06]  So I'm going to tell you a joke. This is a ascension day joke. Are you ready?
[2732.06 --> 2736.52]  Why can God only use his left hand?
[2741.34 --> 2744.38]  Yeah, because Jesus is sitting on his right hand.
[2746.26 --> 2753.98]  That's called a dad joke or maybe a pastor joke. But if it helps you remember that Jesus is at the
[2753.98 --> 2759.32]  right hand of God and he is ruling over all things, okay? So Jesus is king. That's the point.
[2759.32 --> 2765.26]  Let's pray. Let's pray together. Jesus, we worship you because you are the king. And Lord,
[2765.32 --> 2770.68]  we pray for your blessing upon these children as they go to their Sunday school classes. And we
[2770.68 --> 2776.18]  pray for your blessing upon the teachers and the assistants as well. Lord, that these children would
[2776.18 --> 2783.36]  know you as king and worship you to know your protection and your love. We pray in Jesus' name.
[2783.60 --> 2785.86]  Amen. All right. Go ahead to your class.
[2786.76 --> 2788.58]  Amen.
[2788.58 --> 2790.46]  Thank you.
[2791.30 --> 2799.32]  Okay.
[2803.58 --> 2807.52]  Amen.
[2807.52 --> 2809.38]  Amen.
[2809.58 --> 2811.20]  Amen.
[2811.50 --> 2815.58]  Amen.
[2815.58 --> 2840.28]  All right, good morning again.
[2842.10 --> 2842.74]  Thank you.
[2842.74 --> 2850.26]  And so by way of orientation, we are in the season of Eastertide, right?
[2850.30 --> 2858.10]  We remember that Easter is not just a single day, but it is a whole 50-day season when
[2858.10 --> 2863.18]  the church celebrates the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and we celebrate the
[2863.18 --> 2867.86]  life that he brings into the world and that he brings to each one of us, right?
[2867.88 --> 2868.72]  The life of Jesus.
[2868.72 --> 2876.52]  And to help us to explore this during this season, we have been in a sermon series called
[2876.52 --> 2881.92]  Resurrection Presence, where we've been looking at those moments after Jesus rose from the
[2881.92 --> 2888.98]  dead when he comes to be with his disciples and he comes to bring them his life, to restore
[2888.98 --> 2891.82]  them and to encourage them.
[2891.82 --> 2898.30]  You know, when Jesus comes and he finds his disciples and all these different passages
[2898.30 --> 2904.62]  we've looked at over the weeks, you know, he often finds his disciples discouraged, disheartened,
[2905.22 --> 2907.46]  you know, downcast, despairing.
[2907.56 --> 2910.04]  And when he comes, he brings them joy.
[2910.56 --> 2911.96]  He brings them clarity.
[2911.96 --> 2917.04]  He helps them to follow him faithfully as the risen Lord.
[2918.04 --> 2925.92]  And so today, on this Ascension Sunday, we come to the final moment that Jesus spends
[2925.92 --> 2926.70]  with his disciples.
[2927.36 --> 2931.94]  This is the final moment that he has before he departs from them.
[2932.52 --> 2936.26]  So let's open our Bibles this morning to the Gospel of Luke.
[2936.26 --> 2941.48]  So turn to the very last chapter of Luke, Luke 24.
[2942.60 --> 2949.10]  That is on page 788 in your pew Bible.
[2950.50 --> 2952.46]  Page 788.
[2952.46 --> 2953.46]  Page 888.
[2959.22 --> 2966.38]  And today we will read Luke chapter 24 and we'll read from verse 44.
[2967.34 --> 2967.48]  Okay.
[2967.64 --> 2970.90]  So Luke 24 beginning in verse 44.
[2971.24 --> 2973.34]  So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2976.06 --> 2977.78]  Jesus said to them,
[2977.78 --> 2981.36]  This is what I told you while I was still with you.
[2981.98 --> 2986.80]  Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets,
[2987.06 --> 2987.68]  and the Psalms.
[2988.26 --> 2991.48]  Then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures.
[2992.34 --> 2993.00]  He told them,
[2993.12 --> 2994.02]  This is what is written.
[2994.64 --> 2997.78]  The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.
[2998.44 --> 3004.44]  And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all the nations beginning
[3004.44 --> 3005.18]  at Jerusalem.
[3005.50 --> 3007.50]  You are witnesses of these things.
[3007.78 --> 3010.96]  I am going to send you what my father has promised.
[3011.60 --> 3016.48]  But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.
[3017.30 --> 3021.16]  When he led them out to the vicinity of Bethany,
[3021.56 --> 3024.30]  he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
[3024.86 --> 3029.46]  While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
[3029.46 --> 3035.58]  Then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
[3036.02 --> 3039.60]  And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
[3040.16 --> 3041.44]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3041.44 --> 3046.30]  So let's pray together as we come before God's word.
[3046.62 --> 3051.72]  We'll pray for his blessing upon his word as has been read and as it is preached.
[3051.90 --> 3052.28]  Let's pray.
[3052.28 --> 3059.64]  Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the universe, sovereign over all.
[3060.52 --> 3064.20]  Father, you have given us your word that reveals to us who Jesus is.
[3064.98 --> 3071.00]  And so we ask this morning that you would open up our hearts, our minds, our ears by your spirit.
[3071.20 --> 3074.92]  And would you lead us on the paths of Christ.
[3074.92 --> 3078.86]  For your glory and the good of your people we pray.
[3079.28 --> 3079.60]  Amen.
[3080.88 --> 3086.86]  So I am excited today because we get to talk about one of the most important,
[3087.18 --> 3090.98]  yet least understood and certainly least talked about,
[3091.64 --> 3093.84]  event in the life of Jesus.
[3094.46 --> 3096.34]  And that is his ascension.
[3097.18 --> 3100.62]  We just don't talk about the ascension very much.
[3100.68 --> 3101.60]  We don't think about it.
[3101.64 --> 3102.60]  We don't meditate on it.
[3102.60 --> 3106.62]  On Thursday, we had our coffee drop in.
[3107.24 --> 3108.86]  And I joined about halfway through.
[3109.02 --> 3112.24]  And I said, I came and I said, happy ascension day.
[3112.38 --> 3114.98]  Thinking that I'd catch them all by surprise.
[3115.48 --> 3120.62]  But they surprised me because they said, oh, yes, we have been talking about the ascension.
[3121.58 --> 3121.84]  Wow.
[3122.08 --> 3123.84]  So my pastor's heart was very pleased.
[3124.52 --> 3129.72]  That they weren't only talking about the Canucks, but also about the ascension of our Lord.
[3129.72 --> 3136.38]  But even so, the ascension of Christ is not something that we talk about very often.
[3136.98 --> 3142.08]  Even in the church, you know, and so we make a big fuss about Christmas and Easter,
[3142.40 --> 3144.62]  which is absolutely right, right?
[3144.64 --> 3150.20]  We should because those events are at the very center and the very heart of our faith.
[3150.20 --> 3158.02]  And yet, as we see from our text today, the ascension is one of the greatest keys of the Christian life.
[3159.02 --> 3159.52]  Right?
[3159.60 --> 3164.72]  And so just as you would not build a beautiful house for no one to live in,
[3164.72 --> 3170.46]  and just like you wouldn't cook a delicious meal for no one to eat,
[3170.82 --> 3173.80]  the birth of Jesus that we celebrate at Christmas,
[3174.38 --> 3180.30]  the resurrection of Jesus that we celebrate in Easter is of no use to us
[3180.30 --> 3185.06]  unless Jesus ascends to the Father's right hand
[3185.06 --> 3191.36]  to make his life and his salvation available to each one of us.
[3191.36 --> 3198.96]  And so as we look at our text this morning, I'd like us to see what does Luke teach us about the ascension?
[3199.72 --> 3202.80]  You know, what is the ascension exactly?
[3203.22 --> 3206.14]  And what does it have to do with you and me?
[3207.28 --> 3212.08]  And there are three things that we see here in our passage about the ascension, about why it matters.
[3212.82 --> 3215.50]  And so we'll just look at each one of these as we look at our text.
[3215.50 --> 3222.48]  And the first is that in the ascension, we see that Jesus returned to God's presence.
[3222.72 --> 3223.74]  That's our first point.
[3224.28 --> 3227.52]  In the ascension, we see that Jesus returned to God's presence.
[3227.64 --> 3228.74]  That is what is happening.
[3229.48 --> 3230.76]  So here's the context.
[3231.60 --> 3236.12]  Jesus has spent the last 40 days with his disciples, right?
[3236.18 --> 3241.50]  He rose from the dead, and then he comes and he just spends time with his disciples after the resurrection.
[3241.50 --> 3242.68]  He's teaching them.
[3242.90 --> 3244.48]  He's restoring them.
[3244.72 --> 3248.36]  He's preparing them for when he is about to leave.
[3249.38 --> 3251.52]  And so now we come to that moment.
[3251.76 --> 3256.96]  We come to that moment, the last time that Jesus is with his disciples on earth,
[3257.20 --> 3264.14]  until he returns to the earth and comes to judge the living and the dead.
[3264.14 --> 3271.16]  And our passage tells us that he led them outside of the city toward Bethany, right?
[3271.20 --> 3274.00]  It's about a mile and a half outside of Jerusalem.
[3274.96 --> 3278.66]  And, you know, you can just picture Jesus and the disciples walking together,
[3279.42 --> 3283.44]  enjoying this time that they have with Jesus.
[3284.68 --> 3287.92]  And then look with me at verses 50 and 51.
[3288.12 --> 3289.02]  That's where we'll focus.
[3289.02 --> 3295.12]  When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and he blessed them.
[3295.62 --> 3301.64]  While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
[3302.84 --> 3303.78]  And that's it.
[3305.02 --> 3310.00]  Jesus' physical presence on earth has come to an end.
[3311.16 --> 3313.64]  Now, what does this mean?
[3313.72 --> 3316.26]  What is actually going on here?
[3316.26 --> 3321.54]  And so first, let's say what is not happening, what is not going on.
[3322.34 --> 3327.00]  It does not mean, the ascension does not mean that Jesus is up in outer space,
[3327.50 --> 3331.72]  somewhere floating about and dodging satellites, right?
[3331.74 --> 3332.84]  That is not what it means.
[3333.50 --> 3341.20]  So Yuri Gagarin was the Russian cosmonaut who first went up into space since 1961.
[3341.20 --> 3347.88]  And he came back and he was doing a press conference and they asked him what he saw up in space.
[3348.28 --> 3351.40]  And he said, well, I'll tell you what I didn't see.
[3351.68 --> 3354.68]  I didn't see God and I didn't see heaven.
[3356.28 --> 3356.66]  Okay.
[3357.36 --> 3359.70]  I suppose he thought that was clever and funny.
[3360.38 --> 3363.76]  But that is not what Christians believe, right?
[3363.76 --> 3370.44]  The Bible doesn't say that heaven exists within the material realm of the created world.
[3370.44 --> 3374.46]  In such a way that if you just sail through outer space,
[3374.56 --> 3381.10]  that eventually you will, past the stars, past the planets, come to heaven, right?
[3381.42 --> 3383.48]  And there that you will meet God.
[3383.88 --> 3386.86]  The Bible doesn't talk about heaven like that.
[3386.86 --> 3393.26]  So it's important for us to know that heaven in the Bible is not a place in the sky physically,
[3393.64 --> 3397.28]  but heaven is the presence of God.
[3397.86 --> 3403.50]  Heaven is the place where God lives, where God dwells.
[3404.44 --> 3407.82]  Heaven is the word that the Bible uses to describe the place where God lives.
[3408.22 --> 3411.44]  And I think one of the best explanations I've heard to describe this,
[3411.44 --> 3416.12]  especially how heaven and earth relate to one another,
[3416.64 --> 3419.86]  is that it's like light shining through a Venetian blind.
[3420.48 --> 3420.68]  Right?
[3420.72 --> 3421.86]  You know Venetian blinds, right?
[3422.04 --> 3423.24]  They're impossible to clean.
[3424.52 --> 3429.42]  But as the light intersects with the Venetian blind at every point,
[3430.14 --> 3435.08]  in a similar way, our world and heaven intersect with one another.
[3435.96 --> 3437.90]  And we say the blinds are closed.
[3437.90 --> 3439.64]  We can't see on the other side.
[3439.64 --> 3441.66]  We can't see heaven, the reality of heaven.
[3441.86 --> 3443.60]  We can't see the place where God lives.
[3443.94 --> 3446.96]  But every now and then, God turns the blinds.
[3447.52 --> 3449.74]  He pulls away the veil, so to speak,
[3449.78 --> 3452.46]  and we are allowed to kind of see what's going on.
[3453.38 --> 3455.26]  And that is what is happening here.
[3455.32 --> 3457.60]  That's kind of what's happening every time in the Bible.
[3457.72 --> 3461.06]  When angels appear, it's kind of like the veil is lifted.
[3461.50 --> 3464.34]  We see the spiritual reality all around us,
[3464.44 --> 3467.36]  where heaven and earth are intersecting at every point.
[3467.36 --> 3468.96]  Normally, we can't see.
[3469.06 --> 3470.68]  The veil is not open.
[3471.38 --> 3473.58]  So what we see here is Jesus.
[3473.96 --> 3475.14]  What is happening in the ascension?
[3475.28 --> 3478.86]  Jesus is simply moving from the realm of our material world
[3478.86 --> 3481.86]  into the realm where God dwells,
[3482.16 --> 3483.72]  a spiritual realm called heaven.
[3484.42 --> 3486.24]  God's space, our space, and God's space.
[3486.84 --> 3488.82]  Now, usually when we think about the ascension,
[3488.82 --> 3493.66]  the image we might have in our mind is of a superhero flying up into space.
[3494.00 --> 3495.70]  Or, you know, Buzz Lightyear.
[3496.64 --> 3500.20]  To infinity and beyond, right?
[3501.50 --> 3503.44]  So kind of this idea of flying off.
[3504.06 --> 3508.20]  And honestly, some of the artistic depictions of the ascension
[3508.20 --> 3510.74]  that have been handed down to us throughout the history of the church
[3510.74 --> 3514.68]  don't really help us with that sort of interpretation.
[3514.68 --> 3516.12]  So here's an image.
[3516.66 --> 3519.76]  It's a painting by a contemporary artist that actually is beautiful.
[3519.88 --> 3520.78]  I really love this painting.
[3521.48 --> 3524.02]  And it is borrowing from a tradition in the church.
[3524.14 --> 3526.40]  Sometimes you see stained glass windows.
[3526.58 --> 3529.86]  You see the feet of Jesus kind of like at the top hanging down.
[3529.96 --> 3531.12]  You'll see the disciples below.
[3532.16 --> 3535.68]  And we wonder when we see an image like that,
[3536.16 --> 3537.46]  what is going on?
[3537.66 --> 3540.22]  Why is Jesus' feet hanging out of the sky?
[3540.22 --> 3544.22]  And so we say, did Jesus actually fly?
[3545.78 --> 3548.50]  Or, so to speak, or did he kind of lift off the ground?
[3549.60 --> 3551.74]  Well, maybe he did.
[3551.82 --> 3552.50]  Let's just say, sure.
[3552.60 --> 3555.60]  Let's say maybe Jesus did lift off the ground.
[3556.32 --> 3561.08]  In the book of Acts, Luke writes about the ascension in two places in the Bible.
[3561.22 --> 3564.82]  Here, at the end of his gospel, and also in the book of Acts, chapter 1.
[3565.32 --> 3568.08]  And in chapter 1 of Acts, he gives us some more details.
[3568.08 --> 3575.28]  And he says that when Jesus left them, the disciples were standing there looking into the sky.
[3576.24 --> 3578.32]  And an angel has to come, right?
[3578.38 --> 3579.52]  The veil of heaven is open.
[3579.82 --> 3581.32]  An angel comes, and he's like,
[3581.58 --> 3584.16]  Sorry, I don't mean to put that in your ear.
[3585.02 --> 3590.12]  Hey, guys, stop looking into the sky, because Jesus is, he is gone now.
[3590.26 --> 3591.42]  He's not coming back right away.
[3591.74 --> 3593.36]  So, you know, go do what he said.
[3593.76 --> 3595.32]  So the angel has to come and tell them this.
[3595.32 --> 3603.28]  And certainly, the Jesus who turned water into wine, the Jesus who walked on water,
[3603.76 --> 3607.86]  the Jesus who multiplied bread and fish to feed thousands of people,
[3608.52 --> 3610.60]  he has command over nature.
[3611.48 --> 3613.86]  He could lift off the ground, no question about it.
[3614.44 --> 3617.84]  And if that is actually what happened, because I think it's a little bit unclear,
[3617.84 --> 3624.28]  but if that is what happened, what I think he is doing is that he is indicating to his apostles
[3624.28 --> 3626.50]  that he's not coming back.
[3627.18 --> 3630.00]  You know, because like in Luke, right, in Luke 24,
[3630.42 --> 3635.04]  when Jesus appears to his disciples on the road to Emmaus, remember,
[3635.40 --> 3638.52]  he's walking with his disciples, he breaks bread with them,
[3638.58 --> 3640.18]  and then he disappears from their sight.
[3640.18 --> 3644.38]  And so what Jesus is saying here is that this is not like that.
[3644.66 --> 3647.26]  I'm not just disappearing from your sight, and I'm like going to see you tomorrow.
[3648.22 --> 3653.06]  If he's rising from the earth, I think it's to indicate that this is it.
[3653.32 --> 3655.10]  He is truly leaving.
[3657.60 --> 3660.46]  But again, this is unfortunately where we kind of get confused,
[3660.96 --> 3664.36]  and it's where we might get the idea that Jesus is floating in outer space.
[3664.36 --> 3670.82]  And so, again, what is happening is that Jesus is not floating in outer space.
[3670.94 --> 3672.16]  He is returning to God.
[3672.34 --> 3673.70]  He's returning to God's presence.
[3673.82 --> 3674.54]  That's the focus.
[3675.02 --> 3676.36]  And that is what heaven is.
[3676.70 --> 3679.42]  He ascends into heaven, meaning he's going to God's presence.
[3680.54 --> 3685.78]  Heaven is the place where God lives and reigns distinct from the realm of earth.
[3686.50 --> 3690.98]  And another clue into what is going on is in Acts,
[3690.98 --> 3695.02]  when Luke says a cloud took him out of their sight.
[3695.38 --> 3696.54]  And again, we get confused.
[3696.64 --> 3698.52]  We think like the white fluffy thing cloud.
[3699.00 --> 3702.10]  But I don't think that's what it means because follow me here.
[3702.90 --> 3706.06]  Throughout the scriptures, what is the cloud?
[3707.20 --> 3708.64]  If you think about even the Old Testament,
[3708.76 --> 3710.80]  you think about the clouds that we see in the Old Testament.
[3711.68 --> 3715.38]  They are physical manifestations of the presence of God.
[3715.60 --> 3718.32]  So think about the book of Exodus, right?
[3718.32 --> 3720.56]  When God leads the people through the wilderness,
[3720.98 --> 3721.96]  how does he do it?
[3722.74 --> 3723.70]  It's a cloud, right?
[3724.32 --> 3727.56]  And when Solomon builds the temple,
[3727.76 --> 3729.52]  they come to the promised land, they build the temple,
[3730.08 --> 3733.70]  the cloud of the glory of God fills the temple.
[3735.28 --> 3740.08]  And then here in Acts, chapter 17, the transfiguration,
[3740.22 --> 3743.12]  you know, when Jesus took Peter, James, and John,
[3743.12 --> 3746.50]  and they, it's the same word, ascended the mountain of God,
[3746.50 --> 3752.54]  and a cloud envelops them in the voice of God speaks from the cloud.
[3752.54 --> 3756.04]  It says, this is my son whom I love with whom I am well.
[3756.10 --> 3757.02]  Please listen to him.
[3757.78 --> 3761.80]  And so throughout the Bible, we see a cloud is the presence of God.
[3762.26 --> 3766.16]  And so when Luke writes that a cloud hid them from his sight,
[3766.44 --> 3768.10]  from their sight, hid Jesus from their sight,
[3768.10 --> 3773.20]  we are to understand that Jesus has gone into the presence of God.
[3775.08 --> 3777.94]  And I want us to notice something really important here as well,
[3778.68 --> 3782.50]  which is that when the risen Jesus ascends into God's presence in heaven,
[3783.08 --> 3784.52]  he does so how?
[3784.52 --> 3787.24]  With his human body.
[3788.20 --> 3789.14]  Okay, did you notice that?
[3789.86 --> 3794.16]  Jesus didn't just like leave his body on the ground behind,
[3794.86 --> 3796.66]  like, you know, if you're out in the sun,
[3796.94 --> 3800.54]  and it's hot, and you might pull off your sweatshirt, right?
[3801.30 --> 3802.34]  And kind of leave it there.
[3802.96 --> 3804.38]  Like, that's not what Jesus did.
[3804.44 --> 3808.92]  He did not discard his flesh to return to being the pre-incarnate son,
[3809.58 --> 3810.94]  the son before he was born.
[3810.94 --> 3815.44]  But no, actually, at this very moment, right now,
[3816.20 --> 3821.02]  we believe that Jesus is at the right hand of God in the flesh.
[3821.78 --> 3827.26]  That he is every bit as human as you and I are.
[3828.12 --> 3829.24]  He can clap his hands.
[3829.36 --> 3830.34]  He can slap his knees.
[3831.26 --> 3832.04]  All this, you know.
[3832.72 --> 3835.52]  So in other words, the incarnation of Jesus,
[3835.68 --> 3840.04]  he took on flesh, it continues to this day.
[3840.04 --> 3845.72]  Meaning, part of creation, part of our world,
[3845.90 --> 3847.52]  is taken into heaven.
[3848.74 --> 3851.52]  And so Jesus returns to the presence of the Father
[3851.52 --> 3853.90]  as fully human as you and I are.
[3854.64 --> 3856.30]  And therefore, in Jesus Christ,
[3856.42 --> 3860.48]  humanity dwells secure in the presence of God.
[3861.18 --> 3861.92]  Isn't that cool?
[3862.44 --> 3863.82]  It's kind of mind-blowing, right?
[3863.82 --> 3866.14]  And what that means is that Jesus,
[3866.44 --> 3870.20]  as a man in the presence of God,
[3870.26 --> 3873.68]  is a foretaste of what we will experience
[3873.68 --> 3876.42]  when heaven and earth are reunited,
[3876.60 --> 3878.08]  the veil is completely lifted,
[3878.40 --> 3880.94]  and we and our resurrected and restored bodies
[3880.94 --> 3883.04]  will be in the presence of God,
[3883.42 --> 3884.84]  just like Jesus is.
[3884.84 --> 3889.22]  So that's the first thing we see in the ascension.
[3889.32 --> 3890.36]  I know that's kind of a lot.
[3890.80 --> 3892.44]  And the other two points are shorter.
[3893.58 --> 3896.42]  But the first thing you need to understand about the ascension
[3896.42 --> 3900.58]  is that Jesus is returning to the presence of God.
[3901.42 --> 3902.82]  Okay, that's the first thing we learn here.
[3903.24 --> 3905.28]  Now, the second thing about the ascension
[3905.28 --> 3908.66]  is he's not just returning to the presence of God,
[3908.72 --> 3910.96]  but he is ascending the throne.
[3911.58 --> 3913.16]  Okay, Jesus is ascending the throne.
[3913.16 --> 3916.68]  The ascension means that Jesus now reigns as king.
[3917.10 --> 3918.02]  That's the second point.
[3918.74 --> 3921.42]  He now reigns as king over both heaven and earth,
[3921.66 --> 3923.48]  and that is what's happening in the ascension.
[3924.36 --> 3926.92]  And you know that is what happened to Prince William, right?
[3927.02 --> 3927.48]  No, no, sorry.
[3927.82 --> 3928.40]  Prince Charles.
[3928.96 --> 3931.66]  I'm not up on my English monarchy.
[3932.00 --> 3933.06]  Okay, Prince Charles.
[3933.72 --> 3935.18]  So Queen Elizabeth, right,
[3935.22 --> 3936.76]  one of the most amazing women in the world,
[3937.22 --> 3940.14]  died in September of 2022.
[3940.14 --> 3944.42]  And when she died, her son Charles, what did he do?
[3945.38 --> 3950.48]  The language is he ascended to the throne of England,
[3950.52 --> 3954.32]  and now he reigns as King Charles III.
[3955.48 --> 3961.34]  And so Jesus ascended to the throne to reign as king.
[3961.60 --> 3962.84]  That's what the ascension means.
[3962.84 --> 3965.80]  Now Peter, he says it like this.
[3968.48 --> 3972.34]  Jesus Christ has gone into heaven
[3972.34 --> 3976.10]  and is at God's right hand with angels and authorities
[3976.10 --> 3979.86]  and powers in submission to him.
[3981.26 --> 3983.68]  We professed earlier in the Apostles' Creed.
[3984.40 --> 3986.64]  He ascended into heaven and sitteth
[3986.64 --> 3990.28]  at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[3990.28 --> 3993.14]  And so at the Father's right hand, right,
[3993.36 --> 3994.98]  Jesus rules over the world.
[3995.46 --> 3997.06]  He is the sovereign king.
[3998.06 --> 4000.06]  And this, friends, this is incredibly encouraging.
[4000.58 --> 4004.88]  We have, we worship God who became man,
[4005.16 --> 4007.78]  who and who now sits on the throne of heaven.
[4008.78 --> 4010.76]  Because, you know, so often in life,
[4010.84 --> 4012.34]  you and I, we ask these kind of questions.
[4013.00 --> 4016.24]  Where is God in my situation?
[4016.24 --> 4018.52]  Like, where is God in my life,
[4019.30 --> 4021.40]  whatever situation I'm going through?
[4022.22 --> 4024.24]  And often we don't know, right?
[4024.26 --> 4026.78]  We don't always know what God is doing in our lives.
[4027.74 --> 4030.64]  But I'll tell you something we do know.
[4031.42 --> 4034.42]  We know that Jesus is on his throne.
[4035.62 --> 4036.12]  Right?
[4036.16 --> 4037.54]  We know that Jesus is on the throne.
[4037.62 --> 4038.80]  So whatever happens,
[4039.32 --> 4041.38]  he is reigning and ruling over all.
[4041.38 --> 4044.48]  Nothing is outside of his sovereign plan,
[4044.92 --> 4046.04]  his sovereign goodness,
[4046.24 --> 4047.22]  and his sovereign control.
[4048.64 --> 4050.30]  That's what the ascension means for us.
[4050.36 --> 4051.94]  And so every problem we face,
[4052.62 --> 4053.84]  what we know for sure,
[4053.90 --> 4054.98]  in the midst of our confusion,
[4055.08 --> 4056.32]  we don't know what God is doing,
[4057.14 --> 4059.68]  we know that he is on the throne.
[4061.42 --> 4062.62]  So that was the second point.
[4062.70 --> 4063.08]  See, shorter.
[4063.84 --> 4066.02]  Now, the third thing that we want to see here
[4066.02 --> 4068.34]  is that Jesus pours out the Spirit.
[4069.58 --> 4072.92]  Okay, so how amazing is the ascension?
[4073.64 --> 4077.22]  Jesus returns to God's presence in heaven
[4077.22 --> 4078.72]  with his earthly body,
[4078.72 --> 4080.98]  where he now sits at the right hand of God
[4080.98 --> 4083.66]  as the king and reigns over all things.
[4084.42 --> 4085.90]  But not only that,
[4086.54 --> 4088.14]  the final thing we see is that
[4088.14 --> 4089.90]  when Jesus leaves,
[4089.90 --> 4091.50]  the Holy Spirit comes.
[4092.54 --> 4094.28]  Okay, when Jesus leaves in the ascension,
[4094.70 --> 4095.70]  the Holy Spirit comes.
[4096.36 --> 4097.86]  Right, so next week is Pentecost.
[4098.38 --> 4100.08]  We'll be talking more about the Holy Spirit.
[4100.68 --> 4102.54]  But I just want to draw your attention today
[4102.54 --> 4106.02]  to verse 49 in our passage.
[4106.84 --> 4107.88]  So Jesus says this,
[4107.98 --> 4110.74]  I am going to send you what my Father has promised,
[4111.30 --> 4112.56]  but stay in the city
[4112.56 --> 4116.58]  until you have been clothed with power from on high.
[4117.68 --> 4119.40]  So we see here that the ascension
[4119.40 --> 4123.04]  does not mean that Jesus is now missing.
[4123.04 --> 4125.94]  Hey, the ascension doesn't mean
[4125.94 --> 4127.60]  that he is not present with us.
[4127.60 --> 4127.96]  Right?
[4128.02 --> 4128.82]  He's not just like,
[4128.92 --> 4129.94]  okay, I did my work,
[4130.46 --> 4132.36]  I'm going to go retire in Tuscany
[4132.36 --> 4133.88]  or something like that.
[4134.80 --> 4136.46]  Jesus had to ascend
[4136.46 --> 4138.34]  because that's the only way
[4138.34 --> 4140.68]  that he could dwell with us today.
[4141.48 --> 4142.26]  Jesus had to ascend
[4142.26 --> 4143.18]  because it's the only way
[4143.18 --> 4145.30]  he could dwell with each and every one of us.
[4145.96 --> 4146.96]  Because, you know, of course,
[4147.04 --> 4149.04]  when Jesus was here on earth,
[4149.76 --> 4151.42]  even in his resurrected body,
[4151.42 --> 4153.10]  he could only be bodily
[4153.10 --> 4154.96]  in one place at one time.
[4155.20 --> 4156.84]  If Jesus is in Jerusalem,
[4157.30 --> 4159.06]  he is not in Latin or British Columbia,
[4159.52 --> 4160.20]  quite obviously.
[4160.20 --> 4163.46]  And that's why Jesus says,
[4164.08 --> 4165.84]  it is better that I go
[4165.84 --> 4167.98]  because then I will send the Holy Spirit.
[4169.28 --> 4169.82]  And so, you know,
[4169.92 --> 4172.66]  one of the reasons it is better that Jesus goes
[4172.66 --> 4174.34]  is so that Jesus,
[4175.36 --> 4178.18]  now being physically nowhere on earth,
[4178.96 --> 4180.72]  it means that he can now be spiritually
[4180.72 --> 4182.28]  everywhere on earth.
[4182.72 --> 4185.36]  He can be spiritually with every single one of us.
[4185.36 --> 4187.84]  So he ascended to heaven
[4187.84 --> 4189.92]  and he sent his spirit to dwell
[4189.92 --> 4191.50]  with every single one of us.
[4192.04 --> 4194.68]  And not just here and there occasionally,
[4195.12 --> 4197.10]  but throughout our lives
[4197.10 --> 4199.20]  and in every place,
[4199.52 --> 4201.92]  in every person who believes in him
[4201.92 --> 4203.96]  until he returns.
[4204.44 --> 4206.24]  Do you see how much better that is?
[4207.92 --> 4208.78]  And, you know,
[4208.86 --> 4210.70]  if Jesus is everywhere by the spirit,
[4210.86 --> 4211.94]  what does that mean for us?
[4213.24 --> 4214.26]  It means that
[4214.26 --> 4217.60]  if you are in a care home
[4217.60 --> 4219.08]  at Augustine House,
[4219.88 --> 4221.50]  and if you belong to Jesus,
[4222.86 --> 4223.70]  Jesus is there
[4223.70 --> 4226.20]  with you in that care home.
[4227.30 --> 4227.88]  It means that
[4227.88 --> 4229.60]  if you are on the operating table,
[4230.20 --> 4231.68]  being operated on by a doctor,
[4232.30 --> 4233.44]  he is there with you.
[4234.22 --> 4235.66]  He is wherever you go.
[4235.74 --> 4236.34]  He is with you.
[4236.90 --> 4237.64]  And it means that
[4237.64 --> 4238.56]  if that doctor
[4238.56 --> 4240.10]  who is operating on you
[4240.10 --> 4240.74]  is a Christian,
[4241.10 --> 4241.82]  then the power
[4241.82 --> 4242.90]  and the presence of Jesus
[4242.90 --> 4244.06]  is with you.
[4244.26 --> 4247.04]  And when you kids,
[4247.26 --> 4248.34]  when you go to school,
[4248.70 --> 4249.86]  Jesus is there with you.
[4250.70 --> 4252.12]  If you're a mom,
[4252.32 --> 4252.90]  Mother's Day,
[4253.06 --> 4253.64]  you're a mom,
[4253.78 --> 4255.12]  and it's the hardest job
[4255.12 --> 4255.94]  you've ever had,
[4256.56 --> 4257.36]  you need to know
[4257.36 --> 4258.46]  that Jesus is with you.
[4258.72 --> 4258.82]  Right?
[4258.92 --> 4260.34]  Nothing, you know,
[4260.60 --> 4262.32]  and he is enabling you
[4262.32 --> 4263.06]  to accomplish
[4263.06 --> 4265.02]  what you can't accomplish
[4265.02 --> 4265.76]  on your own.
[4265.76 --> 4269.72]  So, because he is there.
[4270.24 --> 4271.98]  He is the king of the universe
[4271.98 --> 4273.56]  and he sends out his spirit,
[4273.64 --> 4274.68]  the spirit of Christ,
[4275.32 --> 4276.06]  to dwell with you,
[4276.14 --> 4277.00]  to empower you,
[4277.08 --> 4277.72]  as it says.
[4279.14 --> 4279.54]  Right?
[4279.62 --> 4280.96]  And this is massively encouraging.
[4282.56 --> 4283.18]  And, you know,
[4283.24 --> 4284.76]  this is the only thing
[4284.76 --> 4285.76]  that can explain
[4285.76 --> 4286.90]  the worship,
[4287.64 --> 4288.42]  the joy,
[4288.42 --> 4289.46]  that we see
[4289.46 --> 4289.90]  at the end
[4289.90 --> 4291.32]  of the book of Luke.
[4291.92 --> 4292.58]  So lastly,
[4292.74 --> 4293.72]  look with me at Luke
[4293.72 --> 4296.10]  verses 52 and 53.
[4297.10 --> 4298.18]  The last two verses
[4298.18 --> 4299.14]  of the whole gospel
[4299.14 --> 4300.06]  of Luke.
[4300.42 --> 4302.22]  Then they worshipped him
[4302.22 --> 4304.26]  and returned to Jerusalem
[4304.26 --> 4306.26]  with great joy.
[4306.26 --> 4308.30]  And they stayed
[4308.30 --> 4309.82]  continually at the temple
[4309.82 --> 4311.32]  praising God.
[4312.74 --> 4312.98]  You know,
[4313.04 --> 4313.88]  remember when Jesus
[4313.88 --> 4314.80]  was with his disciples
[4314.80 --> 4315.58]  before he died
[4315.58 --> 4316.16]  and rose again?
[4316.44 --> 4317.76]  He was telling them,
[4317.84 --> 4318.98]  look, I'm going to go away.
[4319.70 --> 4321.32]  And they were confused
[4321.32 --> 4322.02]  and they were also
[4322.02 --> 4322.76]  just frightened.
[4323.26 --> 4324.30]  And they were panicked.
[4324.38 --> 4325.62]  They didn't want him to leave.
[4326.48 --> 4327.20]  But now,
[4327.34 --> 4328.68]  as he is going,
[4329.40 --> 4330.94]  they're not panicked,
[4331.02 --> 4331.82]  they're not frightened
[4331.82 --> 4333.90]  because they can rest
[4333.90 --> 4335.48]  on what Jesus has done.
[4335.48 --> 4337.68]  He died on the cross.
[4337.78 --> 4338.80]  He rose again
[4338.80 --> 4340.24]  and he is ascending
[4340.24 --> 4340.96]  with a promise
[4340.96 --> 4342.20]  that he will send his spirit
[4342.20 --> 4343.16]  to be with them always.
[4343.58 --> 4344.48]  And so they leave
[4344.48 --> 4345.52]  with great joy.
[4346.90 --> 4348.32]  The ascension of Jesus
[4348.32 --> 4350.04]  does not diminish our joy.
[4350.46 --> 4351.92]  It increases our joy.
[4353.18 --> 4354.12]  Because we see
[4354.12 --> 4355.38]  who Jesus really is.
[4355.64 --> 4357.22]  He is the divine son of God.
[4358.08 --> 4358.98]  He rose again
[4358.98 --> 4360.54]  to defeat sin,
[4360.68 --> 4361.32]  death, and hell.
[4361.90 --> 4362.96]  And he ascended
[4362.96 --> 4363.78]  back to the Father.
[4363.78 --> 4365.54]  You know,
[4365.58 --> 4366.42]  and Luke tells us
[4366.42 --> 4368.40]  that as Jesus was lifted up,
[4368.46 --> 4369.84]  he held out his hands
[4369.84 --> 4372.54]  and while he was blessing them,
[4373.08 --> 4373.98]  he left them.
[4374.28 --> 4375.64]  I love that image of Jesus,
[4376.22 --> 4378.24]  like the last thing he's doing,
[4378.96 --> 4379.18]  you know,
[4379.24 --> 4380.72]  as the car's pulling away
[4380.72 --> 4381.38]  and they're waving
[4381.38 --> 4382.20]  and honking, right?
[4382.54 --> 4384.10]  Jesus is extending his hands
[4384.10 --> 4385.50]  while he is leaving them
[4385.50 --> 4387.24]  and he is just pouring out
[4387.24 --> 4388.12]  his blessing
[4388.12 --> 4389.90]  upon his disciples.
[4389.90 --> 4390.04]  disciples.
[4392.04 --> 4394.40]  That is the last picture
[4394.40 --> 4395.94]  that the disciples had of Jesus.
[4397.54 --> 4398.50]  And I wonder,
[4398.66 --> 4399.80]  is that the picture
[4399.80 --> 4400.82]  that you have
[4400.82 --> 4401.90]  of Jesus?
[4403.04 --> 4404.84]  Of just holding out his hands
[4404.84 --> 4406.32]  and blessing you.
[4407.76 --> 4408.62]  And they go
[4408.62 --> 4409.42]  and they wait for him
[4409.42 --> 4410.74]  to pour out the Holy Spirit
[4410.74 --> 4412.46]  so that they might live
[4412.46 --> 4414.36]  in even closer union with him
[4414.36 --> 4416.08]  than was even possible
[4416.08 --> 4417.60]  when he was here on earth.
[4417.60 --> 4419.84]  And I think that is why
[4419.84 --> 4421.42]  Jesus finished this gospel
[4421.42 --> 4423.14]  by saying they had great joy.
[4424.48 --> 4425.40]  And I don't know if you remember
[4425.40 --> 4426.38]  in Luke,
[4427.02 --> 4428.34]  the beginning of the gospel,
[4428.84 --> 4429.84]  the angel appeared
[4429.84 --> 4431.16]  and said,
[4431.32 --> 4431.70]  for behold,
[4431.78 --> 4432.38]  I tell you,
[4432.52 --> 4433.74]  good news of great joy
[4433.74 --> 4434.86]  that will be for all the people,
[4434.96 --> 4435.20]  right?
[4436.06 --> 4437.50]  And now Jesus has died
[4437.50 --> 4438.74]  and now he has risen
[4438.74 --> 4440.58]  and now he has ascended
[4440.58 --> 4441.70]  to the right hand of the Father
[4441.70 --> 4445.90]  and we too have great joy.
[4447.60 --> 4448.48]  So let's pray.
[4451.92 --> 4452.66]  Lord Jesus,
[4452.80 --> 4453.50]  we praise you
[4453.50 --> 4454.56]  as the risen
[4454.56 --> 4456.52]  and the ascended king.
[4457.54 --> 4459.40]  The king who rules over all.
[4460.32 --> 4460.60]  And Lord,
[4460.68 --> 4462.26]  help us to live each day
[4462.26 --> 4463.90]  with a greater realization
[4463.90 --> 4464.82]  of that truth
[4464.82 --> 4466.78]  that you sit on the throne
[4466.78 --> 4468.18]  so that we might worship you
[4468.18 --> 4469.68]  and put our trust in you
[4469.68 --> 4470.84]  and be filled
[4470.84 --> 4473.18]  like these disciples were
[4473.18 --> 4474.08]  with great joy.
[4474.08 --> 4476.20]  We pray for you,
[4476.36 --> 4478.16]  for this work of the spirit
[4478.16 --> 4480.76]  to happen in our lives
[4480.76 --> 4482.70]  to increase our faith,
[4482.84 --> 4483.54]  increase our joy
[4483.54 --> 4484.36]  and our trust in you.
[4484.88 --> 4486.42]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4486.90 --> 4487.06]  Amen.
[4491.18 --> 4491.72]  All right.
[4491.82 --> 4494.52]  So as our singers come up
[4494.52 --> 4495.18]  and we get ready
[4495.18 --> 4497.14]  to sing our song of response,
[4497.26 --> 4497.94]  let's all stand
[4497.94 --> 4498.80]  and we'll sing
[4498.80 --> 4500.40]  Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise.
[4500.64 --> 4501.06]  Let's sing.
[4501.06 --> 4501.08]  Let's sing.
[4501.08 --> 4501.10]  Let's sing.
[4504.08 --> 4529.12]  Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise.
[4529.12 --> 4559.10]  Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise.
[4559.10 --> 4589.08]  Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise.
[4589.08 --> 4594.08]  Alleluia.
[4595.58 --> 4601.28]  All returning to his throne,
[4601.66 --> 4606.08]  Alleluia.
[4607.46 --> 4613.38]  Still he comes and so is gone,
[4613.38 --> 4620.38]  Alleluia.
[4643.38 --> 4650.38]  Still for us he intercedes,
[4651.08 --> 4655.38]  Alleluia.
[4656.38 --> 4662.38]  His adjoining death may be pleased,
[4662.38 --> 4668.38]  Alleluia.
[4668.38 --> 4674.38]  He himself prevents our face,
[4675.38 --> 4680.38]  Alleluia.
[4680.38 --> 4686.38]  He the first fruits of our praise,
[4686.38 --> 4693.38]  Alleluia.
[4693.38 --> 4700.38]  Alleluia.
[4700.38 --> 4707.38]  There we shall with you remain,

[4761.38 --> 4770.38]  So part of our response to the gospel message this morning is the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4770.38 --> 4778.38]  And you know God is giving us everything and we now just give a little part back to him for the furtherance of his kingdom.
[4778.38 --> 4781.38]  Our designated offering today is for World Renew.
[4781.38 --> 4785.38]  It's our CRC ministry.
[4785.38 --> 4786.38]  And in particular,
[4786.38 --> 4789.38]  there's this part of their work called Women of Hope.
[4789.38 --> 4793.38]  And so as the deacons come and collect the morning offering,
[4793.38 --> 4799.38]  we're going to watch a little video clip that introduces us more to this ministry.
[4799.38 --> 4808.38]  Women of noble character.
[4808.38 --> 4810.38]  Women of wisdom.
[4810.38 --> 4813.38]  Women of courage.
[4813.38 --> 4816.38]  Women of generosity.

[4819.38 --> 4821.38]  Women of success.
[4821.38 --> 4824.38]  Women of dedication.
[4824.38 --> 4825.38]  Women of hope.
[4825.38 --> 4834.38]  Together, we can create more opportunities for women to thrive as the people God made them to be.
[4834.38 --> 4837.38]  She is clothed with strength and dignity.
[4837.38 --> 4839.38]  She can laugh at the days to come.
[4839.38 --> 4842.38]  Proverbs chapter 31 verse 25.

[4908.38 --> 4915.58]  All right.
[4916.00 --> 4916.98]  Get organized here.
[4918.30 --> 4922.52]  Okay, so we will pray together now as a church family,
[4923.38 --> 4927.94]  and we'll pray for God's help and presence among us.
[4927.94 --> 4932.42]  We'll pray for those who need the Lord's healing and blessing,
[4932.84 --> 4935.92]  and also we'll conclude together by saying the Lord's Prayer,
[4936.40 --> 4937.90]  and those words will be on the screen.
[4938.38 --> 4940.28]  When we're ready for them.
[4940.48 --> 4943.46]  So let's bow our heads and let's pray together.
[4945.18 --> 4951.94]  Our Heavenly Father, we confess that our thoughts of you, O Lord,
[4952.88 --> 4954.76]  have been too few.
[4955.76 --> 4956.74]  They have been too small.
[4957.64 --> 4964.00]  For often we have not considered how specifically you are exercising your authority,
[4964.74 --> 4970.06]  extending it to every nook and cranny, every part of your creation.
[4971.38 --> 4975.02]  And so, Lord, we recognize that as you sit on your throne,
[4975.10 --> 4978.90]  that there is no square inch over which you are not king,
[4978.90 --> 4983.70]  and are not reigning in goodness to bring your redemption.
[4983.70 --> 4989.98]  And even, Lord, as your church and as all creation looks forward to its liberation,
[4990.56 --> 4991.50]  its full redemption,
[4992.50 --> 4997.84]  the full implications of your lordship have not yet been revealed to us.
[4997.92 --> 5003.32]  And so, Lord, you reign in even greater ways to come than we can even imagine.
[5003.32 --> 5008.90]  And it is only right for us to acknowledge your dominion over all things,
[5009.16 --> 5013.02]  and your desire to make yourself more fully known throughout all the earth.
[5014.02 --> 5017.50]  And so, Lord, may you be lifted up, O God, in our lives,
[5018.06 --> 5019.18]  through your church,
[5019.92 --> 5021.74]  through our gatherings and our fellowship,
[5022.14 --> 5022.88]  and through our worship.
[5022.88 --> 5026.96]  And may each of us walk in a manner worthy of your calling,
[5027.38 --> 5029.28]  to which we have been called as your people,
[5029.80 --> 5031.20]  people of your own possession,
[5031.94 --> 5034.88]  whose purpose is that we might proclaim your excellencies,
[5035.68 --> 5039.52]  for you have called us out of darkness into your marvelous light.
[5040.58 --> 5043.90]  And, Lord, today we pray for those in our church family
[5043.90 --> 5046.92]  who are going through a season of hardship and suffering.
[5047.66 --> 5052.32]  Lord, you know our hearts and you know our lives better than we know them ourselves.
[5053.18 --> 5056.46]  And so, we ask that you would bring those individuals or families
[5056.46 --> 5060.72]  that are on our hearts and for whom we pray,
[5061.04 --> 5063.92]  Lord, bring them a tangible sense of your comfort even now.
[5064.74 --> 5067.02]  We particularly, Lord, pray for George Culin,
[5067.60 --> 5070.40]  who is in the hospital being treated with a chest infection.
[5071.42 --> 5074.80]  Lord, we ask that you would please be with him now
[5075.04 --> 5078.76]  and grant him full restoration and full recovery.
[5079.44 --> 5082.64]  We thank you that the grace and the peace of Christ
[5082.64 --> 5085.70]  has been given George to strengthen him
[5085.70 --> 5091.64]  and has been his anchor during not only this time,
[5091.74 --> 5092.94]  but throughout his whole life.
[5093.74 --> 5097.58]  We thank you, or we do pray also, Lord, for Grace Koistra,
[5097.68 --> 5099.36]  who is also in the hospital.
[5100.36 --> 5103.12]  We pray for others as well in our congregation
[5103.12 --> 5104.34]  whose bodies are not well.
[5105.28 --> 5107.62]  Jesus, one of the ways that you declared your divinity
[5107.62 --> 5110.80]  was by healing those who are lame, blind, and sick.
[5111.58 --> 5115.30]  And so, in boldness, we ask that you would heal those amongst us
[5115.30 --> 5119.54]  who are sick or in pain, who are broken, and who are weary.
[5119.54 --> 5125.00]  And Lord, we pray also especially this morning for moms.
[5125.46 --> 5127.94]  Lord, we thank you for the mothers that you have blessed us with.
[5128.64 --> 5132.34]  We thank you for grandmothers, for mothers.
[5133.04 --> 5135.64]  And Lord, we ask for your blessing upon them on this day.
[5136.18 --> 5138.26]  And Lord, help us to be grateful for them,
[5138.82 --> 5140.86]  for the blessing that they are in our lives.
[5140.86 --> 5144.46]  And Lord, would you shower upon them today
[5144.46 --> 5146.76]  your special favor and your pleasure.
[5147.82 --> 5151.30]  And Lord, we ask all of this in the name of the ascended Jesus
[5151.30 --> 5155.12]  who taught us and his disciples this prayer
[5155.12 --> 5157.08]  as we say it together now.
[5157.76 --> 5159.54]  Our Father, who art in heaven,
[5160.24 --> 5161.62]  hallowed be thy name.
[5162.26 --> 5163.34]  Thy kingdom come.
[5163.86 --> 5167.00]  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[5167.72 --> 5169.82]  Give us this day our daily bread
[5169.82 --> 5172.20]  and forgive us our trespasses
[5172.20 --> 5175.42]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[5175.86 --> 5177.76]  And lead us not into temptation,
[5178.30 --> 5179.78]  but deliver us from evil.
[5180.40 --> 5182.78]  For thine is the kingdom and the power
[5182.78 --> 5185.38]  and the glory forever and ever.
[5186.06 --> 5186.40]  Amen.
[5188.04 --> 5189.80]  Brothers and sisters, let's stand.
[5190.92 --> 5195.06]  And I want to invite you to a time of fellowship and coffee
[5195.06 --> 5195.96]  right after the service.
[5196.16 --> 5197.90]  It will not be in the fellowship hall
[5197.90 --> 5201.26]  because our Chinese ministry will be having a Mother's Day lunch.
[5202.02 --> 5202.88]  We didn't get invited.
[5204.42 --> 5205.64]  But we have coffee.
[5205.92 --> 5208.04]  So we'll be right in the foyer for coffee.
[5208.86 --> 5211.04]  And now I invite you to hold out your hands,
[5211.20 --> 5213.70]  lift up your hands to receive God's words of blessing
[5213.70 --> 5214.96]  spoken over you.
[5215.28 --> 5216.64]  May the love of the cross,
[5217.34 --> 5219.14]  may the power of the resurrection,
[5219.38 --> 5222.48]  and may the presence of the living God be with you always.
[5222.48 --> 5224.94]  And may the blessings of God Almighty,
[5225.12 --> 5226.30]  Father, Son, and Spirit,
[5226.98 --> 5229.58]  be upon you and remain with you forevermore.
[5230.08 --> 5230.40]  Amen.
[5231.68 --> 5233.08]  And let's stay standing,
[5233.32 --> 5234.94]  and we'll sing our final song
[5234.94 --> 5236.50]  as we leave here this morning.
[5236.50 --> 5256.62]  Rejoice, the Lord is King,
[5256.62 --> 5259.86]  your Lord and King adore.
[5259.86 --> 5264.58]  Rejoice, give thanks, and sing,
[5264.66 --> 5270.18]  and joy of evermore.
[5270.60 --> 5277.76]  Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,
[5277.94 --> 5283.40]  rejoice again, I say rejoice.
[5283.40 --> 5285.40]  rejoice.
[5285.40 --> 5291.34]  Rejoice, if glorious love,
[5291.34 --> 5296.12]  for Christ the God shall come,
[5296.12 --> 5305.38]  together all his saints to their eternal home.
[5305.38 --> 5310.64]  We choose from here,
[5310.64 --> 5315.88]  our angels' voice from our blood.
[5315.88 --> 5326.94]  cannot
