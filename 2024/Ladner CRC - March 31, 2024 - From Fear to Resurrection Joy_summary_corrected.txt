• The resurrection is an historical event

• Women were the first witnesses to Jesus' resurrection
• Matthew's account in his gospel describes Mary Magdalene and other women witnessing Jesus' tomb being empty, with an angel informing them that he has risen
• The angel tells Mary Magdalene and the other women that Jesus is not in the tomb, but has been resurrected.
• Women were considered unreliable witnesses in ancient Jewish culture, making their testimony in the resurrection story significant.
• If the story of the resurrection was fabricated, it would be illogical to make a woman the primary witness.
• God chose these women as the main witnesses to the resurrection because He wanted them to play this role.
• The gospel accounts provide details that give the resurrection a mark of authenticity
• The actual physical resurrection of Jesus is better than any other hypothesis for what happened
• It's impossible to prove the resurrection through natural science or laboratory testing, as it's an historical event
• Believing in the resurrection can be based on historical evidence and doesn't require abandoning reason or intelligence
• At the end of the day, only the work of God in a person's heart will truly convince them of the truth

• Jesus' disciples abandoned him at his most vulnerable moment
• Despite their failure, Jesus calls them "brothers"
• Jesus' words to his disciples are a demonstration of grace and forgiveness
• Everyone has failed God, themselves, and others at some point in their lives
• This experience can lead to a realization that we are not the people we thought we were
