[300.00 → 329.98] Thank you.
[329.98 → 359.96] Thank you.
[360.78 → 365.34] Also, starting up this coming week is our coffee drop-in on Thursday mornings.
[366.06 → 366.92] Yeah, this coming week.
[367.52 → 372.60] We are looking for a few Sunday school teachers to help out starting in this year.
[372.74 → 375.40] Let us know if you're interested in helping out occasionally for that.
[375.40 → 376.40] And if you're interested in joining us, there's a sign-up here.
[405.40 → 418.52] And we're doing this, you know, we're doing this, you're going to do this, you know, and we're going to do this, and we're going to do this.
[418.52 → 418.92] And so, let's do that.
[418.92 → 419.92] And I'll begin.
[448.92 → 478.92] For the Lord is good.
[478.92 → 480.92] And we're going to do this.
[480.92 → 482.96] And we're going to do this, you know, we're going to do this, we're going to do this.
[482.96 → 488.12] we gather here on this family worship Sunday, we praise you for your faithfulness that continues
[488.12 → 495.26] through all generations. And we ask Holy Spirit that you would open the eyes of our hearts this
[495.26 → 501.24] morning, that you would stop our ears, and use all of this service as a means of grace that we
[501.24 → 508.30] might see Jesus, that we might hear his voice, and might come to know him in real and tangible ways
[508.30 → 514.24] in our lives, because that is what we need, and that is what we desire. We pray all these things in the
[514.24 → 523.14] matchless name of Jesus. Amen. Let's all stand, and let's receive God's greeting to us this morning
[523.14 → 531.12] from Isaiah chapter 52. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good
[531.12 → 540.24] news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, your God
[540.24 → 547.02] reigns. So as God has called us into his presence, and he's called us together as a family, let's turn
[547.02 → 549.82] and let's welcome one another as we worship this morning.
[577.02 → 594.08] Okay, so this morning we have a bit of a... All right, calm down.
[597.76 → 606.42] Such a rowdy group. This morning we have a bit of a special treat. We have the USAF,
[606.42 → 612.54] is that what it's called, right? USAF, the USAF choir from our Mandarin group led by Paul,
[612.72 → 617.32] our conductor, and they will lead us in the first song. We'll all sing together, How Great Thou Art,
[617.76 → 621.76] and then for the second song, go ahead and have a seat, because you don't know it, and so we're
[621.76 → 625.62] going to more just kind of listen to the choir as they sing to us, but you can follow along with
[625.62 → 630.92] the words just so you know what they say and can meditate on the words. Okay, so let's sing our first
[630.92 → 631.98] song, How Great Thou Art.
[636.42 → 662.42] comes
[662.42 → 664.42] Amen.

[1286.82 → 1295.72] we know that we don't really deserve in and of ourselves to be in the presence of the living God.
[1296.76 → 1308.04] We cannot even get through a single day perfectly, you know, and even our best good intentions and actions often have mixed motives.
[1309.12 → 1316.50] And so at this time in our service, you know, it's a time of confession where we are invited to bring our failures before the Lord.
[1316.82 → 1322.34] Because he's the one that calls us into his presence, and he renews us in his love and his mercy.
[1322.70 → 1331.10] And he's the one through Christ who makes us fit to be here, not because of ourselves, but because of his grace to us.
[1331.84 → 1337.96] And so as we come to this time of confession, let us read a bit of God's law.
[1338.54 → 1345.56] Not the Ten Commandments, but let's read from Romans chapter 12, verses 9 through 13.
[1345.56 → 1347.78] Let it sink into our hearts.
[1348.20 → 1355.76] Let the Holy Spirit shed light in our hearts about how we can, how we fall short and how he calls us to live.
[1356.06 → 1357.34] So let me read this for us.
[1359.12 → 1360.72] Love must be sincere.
[1362.08 → 1363.28] Hate what is evil.
[1363.96 → 1365.24] Cling to what is good.
[1366.28 → 1368.62] Be devoted to one another in love.
[1370.08 → 1372.32] Honour one another above yourselves.
[1372.32 → 1379.02] Be Never lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervour, serving the Lord.
[1380.10 → 1385.42] Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
[1386.70 → 1388.80] Share with the Lord's people who are in need.
[1389.68 → 1391.06] Practice hospitality.
[1391.06 → 1401.18] So as we've heard God's good law, by the Spirit's help we are able to live into many of these things to some degree.
[1401.68 → 1411.40] But it's also an opportunity to reflect on our own hearts and to confess in those areas that we struggle to live into the law of the Spirit, the new law of Christ.
[1412.26 → 1415.50] And ask God for his help and his mercy once again.
[1415.96 → 1417.94] So let me lead us now in a prayer of confession.
[1418.44 → 1419.36] Please join me in prayer.
[1419.36 → 1429.70] Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[1430.42 → 1432.66] We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1433.32 → 1435.30] We have not loved our neighbour as ourselves.
[1436.14 → 1441.02] We are truly sorry and humbly repent for the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ.
[1441.02 → 1449.70] Have mercy on us and forgive us that we may delight in your will and walk in your ways to the glory of your name.
[1450.34 → 1450.80] Amen.
[1450.80 → 1464.28] So now we receive words of pardon from our loving Father from Romans chapter 8, verses 1 to 2, very familiar passage to us.
[1464.28 → 1470.18] Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[1470.70 → 1479.36] Because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[1480.62 → 1481.18] Amen.
[1481.34 → 1483.84] Brothers and sisters, we are free in Christ.
[1483.96 → 1485.14] There is no condemnation.
[1485.14 → 1493.16] So let's respond to God's mercy and his love for us by standing, and we're singing a song of response.
[1493.28 → 1494.28] His mercy is more.
[1494.58 → 1495.36] Let's stand and sing.
[1495.36 → 1495.38] Let's stand and sing.
[1495.38 → 1525.36] Let's stand and sing.
[1525.38 → 1555.36] Let's stand and sing.
[1555.38 → 1585.36] Let's stand and sing.
[1585.36 → 1587.36] Let's stand and sing.
[1587.36 → 1615.34] Let's stand and sing.
[1615.34 → 1617.34] Let's stand and sing.
[1617.34 → 1629.34] Let's stand and sing.
[1629.34 → 1635.20] Shelf is watching, the test is wrong
[1635.20 → 1640.24] Our sins are ready, mercy is gone
[1640.24 → 1646.72] Our sins are ready, this mercy is gone
[1646.72 → 1653.24] You may receive it
[1659.34 → 1667.40] So we come now to the table of the Lord
[1667.40 → 1672.64] Traditionally, you know, this is actually done after the sermon
[1672.64 → 1675.36] Because we have word and sacrament
[1675.36 → 1679.60] It's the word of God that establishes the sacrament of the Lord's Supper
[1679.60 → 1683.58] But in the freedom that we have in Christ
[1683.58 → 1686.36] We're doing it earlier so that we can celebrate it together
[1686.36 → 1688.70] With our Chinese brothers and sisters as well
[1688.70 → 1695.92] And so, this is the meal that our Lord Jesus Christ has prepared for us
[1695.92 → 1697.88] It's a meal
[1697.88 → 1699.70] I'm breaking up, aren't I?
[1700.78 → 1701.22] We're good?
[1701.68 → 1702.20] We're not good
[1702.20 → 1704.58] Let me grab a hand mic
[1704.58 → 1705.38] Should I do that?
[1705.38 → 1707.38] Yeah
[1707.38 → 1707.94] Yeah
[1707.94 → 1714.02] Yeah
[1714.02 → 1717.26] Yeah
[1717.26 → 1730.14] Yeah
[1730.14 → 1733.14] All right, I'll just turn here to the side.
[1734.84 → 1742.40] Okay, so this meal is for all of those who call on the Lord Jesus Christ by faith.
[1742.78 → 1745.58] And all of those who have been baptized in his name.
[1746.36 → 1756.84] It is for those who come before him with open hands to receive the grace that is offered to us freely in Jesus Christ and his death and his resurrection.
[1756.84 → 1761.10] If that is you this morning, the Lord welcomes you to share in this meal.
[1761.74 → 1777.28] If you are not yet have been baptized, if you are still not sure if you want to trust in Jesus alone for your salvation, then even as the elements are passed to you, please don't take it now because it would not be meaningful to you.
[1777.64 → 1780.40] But wait until you are baptized, and can do it by faith.
[1781.60 → 1785.72] So now would you please join me in prayer as we come before the Lord.
[1786.84 → 1795.70] God, our Father, Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, maker of all things visible and invisible.
[1796.54 → 1808.12] Would you take these visible elements of the bread and the cup and set them apart to point to the invisible realities of Jesus, our Lord.
[1808.90 → 1812.10] Jesus resurrected and reigning in heaven.
[1812.10 → 1821.40] Holy Spirit, would you raise us up with Jesus and seat us at his table that we might feast on him by faith this morning.
[1821.74 → 1823.66] We pray in his name.
[1824.36 → 1824.76] Amen.
[1826.50 → 1830.34] Our Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1831.08 → 1833.94] And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said,
[1833.94 → 1835.58] This is my body given for you.
[1836.32 → 1838.10] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1839.10 → 1842.44] The same way also he took the cup after supper, saying,
[1842.54 → 1844.50] This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[1845.76 → 1849.58] Whenever you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1850.20 → 1853.78] For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[1854.60 → 1857.96] we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1857.96 → 1861.64] So let's say our communion liturgy together.
[1862.76 → 1864.72] Brothers and sisters, lift your hearts.
[1865.14 → 1867.26] We have come to the Lord.
[1867.76 → 1868.92] We are his people.
[1869.58 → 1872.02] We are redeemed by his grace.
[1872.34 → 1874.50] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1875.22 → 1876.54] Christ has died.
[1876.90 → 1877.96] Christ is risen.
[1878.46 → 1880.00] Christ will come again.
[1880.92 → 1883.64] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1883.94 → 1884.26] Hallelujah.
[1885.10 → 1885.66] Hallelujah.
[1885.66 → 1889.60] Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[1890.32 → 1895.56] Take them and feed on Jesus in your hearts by faith with Thanksgiving,
[1896.16 → 1900.26] trusting and knowing and believing that Jesus has died
[1900.26 → 1903.36] so that there is now, therefore, no condemnation.
[1904.30 → 1907.12] May I ask those elders and deacons who are serving
[1907.12 → 1910.38] to please come forward and help me with the distribution of the elements.
[1915.66 → 1917.84] Lord, revolt and sister.
[1917.84 → 1918.10] Amen.
[1918.32 → 1920.14] virgin and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.

[2372.52 → 2376.52] So hold the cup until after I'm done praying and then put it in the pews.
[2376.52 → 2378.52] We're going to try this.
[2378.52 → 2380.52] A little tweak.
[2380.52 → 2386.52] So take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for the remission of all of our sins.
[2386.52 → 2390.52] Let's drink together.
[2390.52 → 2392.52] Let's pray.
[2394.52 → 2399.52] Father, we thank you, Lord, for your great sacrifice for us.
[2399.52 → 2402.52] Lord, you humbled yourself.
[2402.52 → 2405.52] You became in the form of a servant.
[2405.52 → 2411.52] Lord, you became like us as a man, and you humbled yourself even to death on the cross.
[2411.52 → 2413.52] Even when we were your enemies in our sin.
[2413.52 → 2421.52] And, Lord, you did it because of your love, your grace, your initiative, in order to redeem us as a people for yourself, for your glory.
[2421.52 → 2425.52] Lord, we thank you that we are recipients of that grace.
[2425.52 → 2431.52] And help us, Lord, as we seek to follow you and be your people in this world.
[2431.52 → 2433.52] We pray in Jesus name.
[2433.52 → 2435.52] Amen.

[2446.52 → 2447.52] Yes, they community.
[2447.52 → 2448.52] Okay.
[2448.52 → 2451.12] Ms.
[2451.12 → 2452.52] Yes.
[2452.52 → 2453.52] And I was honoured to be ready for COM.
[2453.52 → 2457.52] Since we are a בה ring, hole a SI of a port.
[2457.52 → 2487.50] Thank you.
[2487.52 → 2517.50] Thank you.
[2517.52 → 2519.52] Thank you.
[2519.52 → 2521.52] Thank you.
[2521.52 → 2522.52] Wow.
[2522.52 → 2523.52] That's perfect.
[2523.52 → 2524.52] A polar bear.
[2524.52 → 2525.52] You're totally right.
[2525.52 → 2526.52] Look.
[2526.52 → 2527.52] I'll show everyone.
[2527.52 → 2528.52] See?
[2528.52 → 2529.52] It's a polar bear.
[2529.52 → 2530.52] You see it?
[2530.52 → 2531.52] You see?
[2531.52 → 2532.52] It's kind of hard to see a little bit.
[2532.52 → 2533.52] This one's a little bit worn out.
[2533.52 → 2534.52] See?
[2534.52 → 2535.52] There's a polar bear on there.
[2535.52 → 2536.52] You see?
[2536.52 → 2537.52] Yeah.
[2537.52 → 2538.52] There.
[2538.52 → 2539.52] Polar bear.
[2539.52 → 2540.52] Yeah.
[2540.52 → 2542.52] You can see it?
[2542.52 → 2543.52] Yeah.
[2543.52 → 2544.52] See?
[2544.52 → 2545.52] There's a little polar bear.
[2545.52 → 2546.52] You see it?
[2546.52 → 2547.52] Yeah.
[2547.52 → 2548.52] Okay.
[2548.52 → 2549.52] So there's a polar bear on there.
[2549.52 → 2550.52] That's perfect.
[2550.52 → 2555.52] And who knows whose face is on the other side?
[2555.52 → 2556.52] Queen who?
[2556.52 → 2557.52] Elizabeth II.
[2557.52 → 2558.52] Okay.
[2558.52 → 2563.52] So on one side of the coin is a polar bear and on the other side is Queen Elizabeth II.
[2563.52 → 2564.52] What?
[2564.52 → 2565.52] Vote?
[2565.52 → 2566.52] Okay.
[2566.52 → 2567.52] Yeah.
[2567.52 → 2570.52] So how many coins do I have?
[2570.52 → 2573.52] One coin, but how many pictures are on it?
[2573.52 → 2576.52] So there's a polar bear and there's a queen.
[2576.52 → 2578.52] Are polar bears and queens and queens?
[2578.52 → 2579.52] Who?
[2579.52 → 2580.52] Elizabeth II.
[2580.52 → 2581.52] Okay.
[2581.52 → 2584.52] So on one side of the coin is a polar bear and on the other side is Queen Elizabeth II.
[2584.52 → 2585.52] What?
[2585.52 → 2586.52] Vote?
[2586.52 → 2587.52] Okay.
[2587.52 → 2588.52] Yeah.
[2588.52 → 2589.52] So how many coins do I have?
[2589.52 → 2592.52] One coin, but how many pictures are on it?
[2592.52 → 2595.52] Are polar bears and queens related in any way?
[2595.52 → 2599.52] Not really, but there are two sides of the same coin.
[2599.52 → 2606.52] Now the reason I'm talking about this is that it reminds me of a verse that we read in Romans
[2606.52 → 2610.52] that actually we're going to talk about today with all the adults.
[2610.52 → 2617.52] So in Romans chapter one, Paul says that he is calling people from all the nations to
[2617.52 → 2620.52] the obedience of faith.
[2620.52 → 2621.52] The obedience of faith.
[2621.52 → 2622.52] Okay.
[2622.52 → 2623.52] So those are two things, right?
[2623.52 → 2624.52] Obedience and faith.
[2624.52 → 2626.52] Who knows what faith means?
[2626.52 → 2627.52] Wow.
[2627.52 → 2628.52] That's very smart.
[2628.52 → 2629.52] Yeah.
[2629.52 → 2630.52] To trust in God.
[2630.52 → 2633.52] And then what did you say?
[2633.52 → 2635.52] What God says he will do, he will do it.
[2635.52 → 2636.52] Wow.
[2636.52 → 2637.52] We should all take notes.
[2637.52 → 2638.52] That's great.
[2638.52 → 2639.52] Okay.
[2639.52 → 2640.52] Faith, trust in God.
[2640.52 → 2641.52] That God will do what he says he will do.
[2641.52 → 2642.52] I couldn't have said it better myself.
[2642.52 → 2644.52] Then there's the obedience that comes from faith.
[2644.52 → 2646.52] So faith is trust in God.
[2646.52 → 2647.52] What's obedience mean?
[2647.52 → 2648.52] What does it mean to obey?
[2648.52 → 2649.52] What does it mean to obey?
[2649.52 → 2654.52] Like if you have to obey your mom or obey your dad, what does that mean?
[2654.52 → 2655.52] Go ahead.
[2655.52 → 2656.52] To do what they say.
[2656.52 → 2657.52] Yes.
[2657.52 → 2658.52] Excellent.
[2658.52 → 2659.52] Okay.
[2659.52 → 2660.52] So faith is to trust in God.
[2660.52 → 2661.52] To do what God says.
[2661.52 → 2662.52] To do what God says.
[2662.52 → 2663.52] So faith is to trust in God.
[2663.52 → 2665.52] To obey means to do what God says.
[2665.52 → 2676.52] So the thing is when God calls us to believe in him, it's two things that he wants us to do.
[2676.52 → 2678.52] They're two sides of the same coin.
[2678.52 → 2679.52] Faith and obedience.
[2679.52 → 2682.52] And they go together just like one of the things that we have to do.
[2682.52 → 2689.52] So the thing is when God calls us to believe in him, it's two things that he wants us to do.
[2689.52 → 2691.52] They're two sides of the same coin.
[2691.52 → 2693.52] Faith and obedience.
[2693.52 → 2702.52] And they go together just like one is one coin and there's one calling to us that is obedience and faith.
[2702.52 → 2705.52] The obedience that comes from faith or faith and obedience.
[2705.52 → 2706.52] They're just bound up together.
[2706.52 → 2707.52] It's hard to separate them.
[2707.52 → 2712.52] Now we say that there's nothing we have to do for God to accept us as his children.
[2712.52 → 2713.52] Right.
[2713.52 → 2715.52] God gives us faith as a gift.
[2715.52 → 2717.52] But then if we really have faith, we will also obey him.
[2717.52 → 2719.52] We will do what he says.
[2719.52 → 2720.52] Okay.
[2720.52 → 2721.52] Can you remember that?
[2721.52 → 2722.52] Okay.
[2722.52 → 2723.52] So it's just like a polar bear in Queen Elizabeth.
[2723.52 → 2724.52] Faith and obedience.
[2724.52 → 2725.52] One.
[2725.52 → 2726.52] This is what I thought of.
[2726.52 → 2727.52] Okay.
[2727.52 → 2728.52] One coin.
[2728.52 → 2730.52] Faith and obedience.
[2730.52 → 2731.52] Okay.
[2731.52 → 2732.52] Trust in God and do what he says.
[2732.52 → 2733.52] Okay.
[2733.52 → 2737.52] We believe in him and we follow him and do what he says in our lives.
[2737.52 → 2738.52] Okay.
[2738.52 → 2740.52] Can you remember that?
[2740.52 → 2741.52] Great.
[2741.52 → 2742.52] Let's pray.
[2742.52 → 2748.52] Father, we thank you so much for the grace that calls us to the obedience of faith.
[2748.52 → 2749.52] To trust in you.
[2749.52 → 2752.52] To live out that trust in all of our lives.
[2752.52 → 2759.52] And Lord, I pray for each of these children that you would help them by your spirit to grow up to trust you and to obey you.
[2759.52 → 2760.52] We pray in Jesus name.
[2760.52 → 2761.52] Amen.
[2761.52 → 2762.52] All right.
[2762.52 → 2763.52] Head off to your classes.
[2763.52 → 2781.52] Thanks for joining me.
[2781.52 → 2808.90] All right, good morning.
[2811.52 → 2821.58] So we finished up our Summer in the Psalms last week, and today I'm very excited to start a new series in the Book of Romans.
[2822.48 → 2828.88] And I'm excited because Romans has really had a tremendous impact on my life, on my spiritual journey.
[2829.50 → 2840.86] When I was growing up in my home church, my pastor preached a series in the Book of Romans that took how long?
[2840.86 → 2842.08] Can you guess?
[2844.02 → 2845.44] Five years.
[2846.26 → 2847.10] Five years.
[2848.10 → 2851.10] From 1993 to 1997.
[2851.72 → 2855.64] So that was the time when I was between the ages of 13 and 18.
[2856.40 → 2858.98] So my teenage years in church, Romans.
[2858.98 → 2859.14] Romans.
[2860.26 → 2866.30] So it's had a very formative, it's been really formative in my life.
[2866.68 → 2869.84] And so, don't worry, no.
[2870.38 → 2871.94] I'm not going to do five years.
[2871.94 → 2880.30] But we are going to work our way through the letter, not like verse by verse, but section by section.
[2880.42 → 2882.30] We're going to walk our way through the Book of Romans.
[2882.74 → 2884.06] I don't know how long it will take.
[2884.12 → 2885.06] We'll see how the Lord leads.
[2885.06 → 2896.00] So as we explore Romans together, my prayer is that we would just become deeply rooted in our faith in Jesus Christ.
[2896.66 → 2904.76] And we become deeply rooted in our sense of belonging to Christ and all that that means for our lives.
[2905.54 → 2908.40] So let's open our Bibles this morning to the Book of Romans.
[2908.40 → 2917.44] That's on page 836, 836 in your pre-Bible.
[2918.36 → 2923.32] And we'll be reading Romans chapter 1, verses 1 through 7, the introduction part.
[2926.46 → 2927.68] Romans 1, 1 to 7.
[2932.50 → 2934.68] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2935.10 → 2936.10] I will read it for us.
[2936.10 → 2943.28] Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God,
[2943.98 → 2949.52] the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his son,
[2950.40 → 2953.06] who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,
[2953.76 → 2958.44] and who through the spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the son of God
[2958.44 → 2962.40] by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2962.40 → 2971.00] Through him and for his namesake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles
[2971.00 → 2973.56] to the obedience that comes from faith.
[2974.38 → 2978.96] And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
[2979.78 → 2982.98] To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints,
[2983.66 → 2988.74] grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2988.74 → 2990.74] This is the word of the Lord.
[2991.48 → 2992.22] Thanks be to God.
[2992.56 → 2993.38] Let's pray.
[2994.98 → 2998.18] Heavenly Father, as we open your inspired word,
[2998.64 → 3001.32] we ask that by your Holy Spirit that you would teach us
[3001.32 → 3006.22] and reprove us and correct us and train us in righteousness,
[3007.02 → 3009.60] that we may be equipped for every good work,
[3010.22 → 3011.64] through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3012.20 → 3012.64] Amen.
[3012.64 → 3019.10] So today is an intro sermon, which is always an interesting sermon,
[3019.38 → 3026.22] because there is some context that needs to be given to help us understand the book as a whole.
[3026.88 → 3030.16] And that will help us as we go on and look through Romans.
[3031.06 → 3033.42] And so just as in, you know, with a symphony,
[3033.86 → 3036.16] there's an overture that kind of begins it,
[3036.22 → 3042.08] and it introduces some motifs, some notes that will recur throughout the music.
[3042.64 → 3045.40] In the same way, Paul, in this introduction,
[3046.46 → 3051.56] introduces some notes about the gospel and God's grace
[3051.56 → 3056.24] that will recur throughout the letter of Romans.
[3056.96 → 3060.24] And so, and also, you know, just like a Beethoven symphony,
[3060.96 → 3064.22] Paul's letter to the Romans really is a masterpiece.
[3064.22 → 3070.08] Samuel Coleridge, who is one of the great writers in the history of the English language,
[3070.20 → 3071.36] said about Romans,
[3071.92 → 3076.16] it is the profoundest piece of writing in existence.
[3078.54 → 3079.10] Right?
[3079.58 → 3081.36] It's pretty high praise.
[3082.98 → 3085.16] And like also any great masterpiece,
[3085.40 → 3088.44] whether it's art or music or literature,
[3088.44 → 3092.06] it's almost impossible to fully grasp.
[3093.52 → 3097.66] One of the commentators who's written thousands of pages on Romans,
[3097.72 → 3100.44] if anybody could grasp Romans, maybe it would be him.
[3101.08 → 3103.10] But he says at the beginning of his commentary,
[3103.66 → 3107.66] anyone who claims to understand it is mistaken.
[3107.66 → 3111.12] Which is a little bit daunting.
[3112.48 → 3116.70] But what that means is that we come to God's word always,
[3117.40 → 3118.58] maybe especially now,
[3119.04 → 3120.24] in a spirit of humility.
[3120.90 → 3122.46] Asking God to teach us,
[3122.60 → 3124.10] asking the Holy Spirit to help us,
[3124.52 → 3127.40] to teach us what he would have us to know about him.
[3127.58 → 3129.94] But we do believe that God's word is for us.
[3130.54 → 3132.92] It's written so that we can know God
[3132.92 → 3135.46] and understand his plan of salvation for our lives.
[3135.46 → 3139.76] So we can understand it as much as God would want us to.
[3140.44 → 3142.06] So let's go ahead and dive in this morning.
[3142.18 → 3143.30] And I want to do two things.
[3143.46 → 3148.24] First, I want to get just a bit of a view of Romans as a whole.
[3149.18 → 3150.02] And then secondly,
[3150.46 → 3153.14] I want us to look at how Paul introduces the theme of the gospel,
[3153.78 → 3156.02] which is really the main theme of the entire letter.
[3156.42 → 3159.84] And there will be a few points about the gospel that we'll look at.
[3160.56 → 3164.68] So first, let's talk about the letter of Romans as a whole.
[3164.68 → 3166.80] Look with me at verse one.
[3167.98 → 3170.92] Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,
[3171.50 → 3176.30] called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.
[3177.44 → 3179.44] Who is Paul?
[3181.10 → 3182.80] Most of you will probably know.
[3183.42 → 3185.36] Originally, you know, in the book of Acts,
[3185.56 → 3189.70] he is introduced to us as Saul, right?
[3189.74 → 3190.58] His Hebrew name.
[3191.54 → 3193.28] And Saul was a Pharisee.
[3193.28 → 3197.18] He was committed to Torah, the law of God.
[3197.28 → 3201.64] And he was committed to the traditions of the people of God.
[3201.74 → 3203.74] And he knew both of them very well.
[3204.00 → 3204.74] He was an expert.
[3206.00 → 3210.46] And he perceived this new movement of Jesus.
[3211.66 → 3215.10] And all these people following this teacher named Jesus,
[3215.24 → 3220.42] he saw it as a serious threat to the law of God and to the tradition of God.
[3220.42 → 3225.10] So as he's going about one day on his way to persecute some of these Christians,
[3225.32 → 3228.40] trying to stamp out this Jesus movement.
[3228.50 → 3229.28] It's so dangerous.
[3230.14 → 3232.84] He meets on the road to Damascus.
[3232.94 → 3234.46] He meets the resurrected Lord.
[3234.46 → 3241.54] And when he does, the scales fall from his eyes, and he sees Jesus for who he really is.
[3242.66 → 3246.60] And not only does he see Jesus, he receives from Jesus a commission,
[3247.06 → 3251.24] a calling to be the apostle to the Gentiles, right?
[3251.24 → 3255.66] To go beyond the Jews to take the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[3255.66 → 3264.92] And so he switches as the apostle to the Gentiles from using his Hebrew name Saul to his Greek name Paul.
[3265.84 → 3268.68] And so Paul is the author of the book of Romans.
[3269.94 → 3274.66] And now he wrote this letter to the church in the great city of Rome.
[3274.66 → 3278.88] And so, you know, from reading the book of Acts, we know that Paul,
[3279.08 → 3285.48] as he would set off on these missionary journeys all around the Mediterranean world, the Roman Empire,
[3286.00 → 3289.90] and he would go about sharing Jesus, preaching the gospel.
[3290.74 → 3294.12] And as he did that, people would come to faith in Jesus.
[3294.74 → 3297.18] Like him, the scales would fall from their eyes.
[3297.52 → 3300.38] They would trust in Jesus as God's Messiah.
[3300.38 → 3304.04] And as a result, churches would be formed.
[3305.08 → 3307.50] And then occasionally, Paul would write letters to these churches.
[3307.92 → 3309.72] You know, he would answer their questions.
[3309.92 → 3312.18] He would clarify the true gospel.
[3312.60 → 3314.02] He would dispel false teaching.
[3314.48 → 3317.46] He wrote all these letters that we have in our New Testament.
[3318.64 → 3323.70] But what is unique about the book of Romans is that Paul didn't plant that church.
[3324.66 → 3328.82] In fact, Paul has never been to Rome.
[3330.38 → 3338.08] So why is Paul writing to this group of Christians in this very faraway city of Rome in the Roman Empire?
[3338.84 → 3340.68] Why is he writing to them?
[3340.72 → 3341.90] He has no contact with them.
[3341.96 → 3342.64] He's never been there.
[3342.72 → 3343.76] He didn't plant that church.
[3344.62 → 3347.00] Well, he doesn't tell us exactly the reason.
[3347.50 → 3349.86] But as we read the letter, two things emerge.
[3349.86 → 3362.66] The first is that Paul writes so that the Roman church would be unified by the good news of Jesus Christ as one new family, Jews and Gentiles together.
[3362.66 → 3366.42] Because the church originally was made up of both Jews and Gentiles.
[3366.42 → 3376.28] But there's this interesting historical thing that happened, which is the emperor at the time, Claudius, he got really upset with the Jews.
[3376.76 → 3378.36] So he kicked them out of Rome.
[3378.68 → 3382.14] For five years, all Jews had to be gone from the city of Rome.
[3382.14 → 3388.68] And then when the Jews came, the Jewish Christians, they came back into Rome, into the churches.
[3389.48 → 3396.50] It really kind of heightened the cultural differences between Jews and Gentiles.
[3397.04 → 3399.00] So there's this cultural clash that's happening.
[3399.44 → 3402.00] And Paul wants to bring about a unified church.
[3402.00 → 3414.90] And that leads to the second reason Paul writes this letter, which is that the church in Rome, so that they would become partners with him for his missionary journey that he wants to take to Spain.
[3416.74 → 3424.84] You know, and so Rome is much closer to Spain than the Antioch church, which had been his partner church for his earlier missionary journeys.
[3425.08 → 3431.48] So it makes sense for Rome to be this new base for his missionary operations further west.
[3432.00 → 3437.10] So Paul's writing this letter, in effect, basically saying, hey, can I come visit?
[3437.26 → 3438.76] I want to show my slides.
[3439.28 → 3443.68] I want to pass the offering plate for this new ministry I'm doing in Spain.
[3445.08 → 3446.06] That's what Paul's doing.
[3446.16 → 3447.88] So that's a bit of the context of the letter.
[3448.18 → 3451.70] To summarize, Paul is the apostle to the Gentiles.
[3451.98 → 3457.02] He writes his letter to this group of Christians he's heard about in Rome, even though he's never been there,
[3457.02 → 3465.22] in order to explain how the gospel of Jesus Christ can unify the church of made up of both Jews and Gentiles,
[3465.22 → 3469.40] and also how the gospel can make them into a mission church,
[3469.40 → 3476.12] who will partner with him for the continued spread of the gospel, especially to Spain.
[3476.12 → 3482.32] So that's what's going on in the book of Romans in a little nutshell.
[3483.06 → 3487.78] And in order to accomplish these purposes of bringing about a unified church and a mission church,
[3488.12 → 3491.98] Paul writes the most comprehensive account of the gospel that he's written.
[3492.92 → 3498.38] And what he understands God is doing through Jesus Christ, and we benefit from that.
[3498.94 → 3504.50] We can have more insight into what God is doing through Jesus Christ and how that relates to our lives.
[3504.50 → 3507.84] So now I want to switch gears.
[3508.62 → 3509.60] That was the intro part.
[3510.56 → 3515.48] And I want to now kind of dig more into the passage and look at how Paul introduces the gospel.
[3516.44 → 3519.02] Okay, again, that's the main theme of the book of Romans, the gospel.
[3519.58 → 3523.64] And there are five things that I want us to notice here in the opening verses,
[3523.96 → 3526.22] and we are just going to look at each of them briefly.
[3526.62 → 3531.24] But Paul just unpacks a lot, even in these first seven verses, about the gospel.
[3531.24 → 3534.82] And again, these are recurring notes that we will see throughout the book.
[3535.78 → 3540.08] So firstly, where does the gospel come from?
[3540.48 → 3541.60] That's our first point here.
[3543.74 → 3547.32] And the answer is the gospel comes from God.
[3548.12 → 3550.42] Okay, so what is the source of the gospel?
[3550.70 → 3551.94] Let's look again at verse one.
[3551.94 → 3559.60] Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.
[3560.26 → 3561.08] Very simple.
[3561.68 → 3563.78] But where does the gospel come from?
[3564.04 → 3565.86] It comes from God.
[3566.64 → 3567.92] It's God's gospel.
[3568.66 → 3571.64] And that means it's not a human invention.
[3571.64 → 3572.08] Right?
[3572.80 → 3581.12] If we got all of us, let's say, and we put our heads together, and we gave ourselves five years,
[3582.22 → 3586.22] we would not ever come up with the gospel.
[3588.08 → 3591.96] We wouldn't come close to anything like the gospel of God, because it is God's.
[3592.56 → 3596.94] He came up with it, and therefore, for us to know it, he has to reveal it to us.
[3596.94 → 3602.74] And that is humbling to us, and it's also hopeful for us.
[3603.72 → 3605.06] So that's the first point.
[3605.34 → 3607.04] The gospel comes from God.
[3607.68 → 3615.26] The second thing that we see is that the gospel is continuous with God's plan of salvation throughout the Old Testament.
[3616.64 → 3620.48] Okay, it's not a new thing that Paul is talking about,
[3620.54 → 3624.78] but it's something that God has always been doing throughout the history of his people.
[3624.78 → 3626.28] So look with me at verse two.
[3627.48 → 3631.06] Paul says that he has been set apart for the gospel of God,
[3631.40 → 3636.84] the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures.
[3638.04 → 3641.40] So Paul says here that the gospel that comes from God,
[3641.86 → 3646.96] it comes from way back deep in the Old Testament,
[3647.52 → 3650.08] where it announces that God is going to come,
[3650.08 → 3654.54] and he is going to dwell with his people in order to redeem his people.
[3655.00 → 3656.76] And he is going to fulfill his promises.
[3657.94 → 3660.94] And God did this by coming to us in the person of Jesus Christ.
[3661.64 → 3664.84] The writer of the Hebrews says it this way,
[3664.84 → 3671.92] In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways.
[3672.26 → 3675.94] But in these last days, he has spoken to us by his son.
[3675.94 → 3681.98] And so what I want to point out is that as we go through the book of Romans in the coming weeks,
[3682.76 → 3688.06] Paul is going to continually be pointing us back to the Old Testament scriptures.
[3688.06 → 3695.72] And in fact, there are something like 50 direct quotes from the Old Testament in the book of Romans alone,
[3696.06 → 3698.82] along with countless allusions and images.
[3698.82 → 3703.30] And what Paul is saying is that Christianity is not a new religion.
[3703.52 → 3703.92] Right?
[3704.72 → 3708.58] It's not like God got sick and tired of Israel.
[3708.88 → 3710.02] You know, they're stiff-necked people.
[3710.02 → 3712.24] And so on day he's up in heaven.
[3712.36 → 3713.64] He got a bunch of angels together.
[3713.94 → 3715.78] And he gathers them, you know, in his court.
[3716.16 → 3720.04] And he says to them, you know, look, this is just not working.
[3720.46 → 3728.00] You know, this plan of saving, you know, the Hebrews and that they're going to spread the knowledge of God around the world.
[3728.06 → 3728.72] It's not working.
[3729.12 → 3730.54] Anybody got a better idea?
[3730.62 → 3731.40] We need a plan B.
[3731.40 → 3733.54] Okay, that's not what happened.
[3734.32 → 3741.10] Paul says that all the intentions and actions of God, all the words of God spoken through the prophets,
[3741.32 → 3748.88] are all promises of Jesus Christ and of the gospel that has now been made known to us.
[3750.36 → 3755.16] You know, and what that means, of course, is that the Old Testament is not complete without the New Testament.
[3755.80 → 3759.08] And in the same way, the New Testament is not complete without the Old Testament.
[3759.08 → 3759.48] Right?
[3759.48 → 3764.66] They are both part of one big story, the story of the gospel.
[3766.28 → 3769.26] So I know some of you like to read crime novels.
[3770.16 → 3770.34] Yeah?
[3771.16 → 3773.24] Detective stories, I think, some of you.
[3776.04 → 3782.24] So I want you to imagine, and I know, importantly, that some of you will trade novels.
[3782.64 → 3784.42] You know, you read one, you pass it on to someone else.
[3784.42 → 3792.40] And so imagine that I have a new novel, a crime novel, and I get my new book and I just tear it right in half.
[3793.12 → 3801.22] And let's say I keep one half, let's say the second half, and I give the other half to my friend.
[3801.22 → 3806.56] How is that going to work out for understanding the story?
[3806.80 → 3808.26] It's not going to work well at all.
[3808.90 → 3813.46] And that's kind of like what we do as Christians when we just read one Testament.
[3814.46 → 3814.70] Right?
[3814.78 → 3819.86] If you just read the Old Testament, you've got no idea what it's all leading up to.
[3819.86 → 3822.00] You won't know who's done it, right?
[3822.60 → 3831.46] But if you just read the New Testament, you know how the story ends, but it doesn't make any sense because you won't understand what came before.
[3831.90 → 3833.34] So you don't understand what it means.
[3834.50 → 3845.16] And so Paul is continually emphasizing throughout the book of Romans that the gospel, it can only be the gospel of God if it stands in continuity with what God has always been doing.
[3845.16 → 3852.22] Because the message of the Old Testament is God promising what he is going to do in Jesus Christ to save his people.
[3854.14 → 3855.64] So that's the third thing we see.
[3856.32 → 3856.44] Right?
[3856.50 → 3858.82] And so the gospel, it comes from God.
[3859.14 → 3861.44] It's continuous with the Old Testament.
[3862.00 → 3864.22] And third, it is centred on Christ.
[3866.08 → 3868.42] And we learn all of this in these first few verses.
[3868.42 → 3874.48] And there's such a focus on Jesus Christ in these few verses.
[3875.16 → 3878.74] So let's look at verses 3 to 4 in particular.
[3879.62 → 3881.88] So he's continuing to talk about the gospel.
[3882.34 → 3883.02] And he says,
[3883.02 → 3899.32] It's the gospel of God regarding his son, Jesus, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David, and who through the spirit of holiness was appointed the son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead.
[3899.66 → 3901.98] Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3901.98 → 3909.14] And I want you to, I want us to focus on that last phrase, that last bit there.
[3909.80 → 3912.30] Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3913.44 → 3922.10] Because calling Jesus Lord was very significant in the Roman world of Paul's day.
[3922.10 → 3923.90] We're kind of used to it, right?
[3923.94 → 3925.74] We say, Lord, all the time.
[3926.26 → 3926.46] You know?
[3926.62 → 3927.56] We pray, Lord.
[3927.64 → 3928.86] We talk about Jesus as Lord.
[3929.32 → 3931.56] But it was actually very specific.
[3931.94 → 3934.66] And it had a very strong significance in the Roman world.
[3935.28 → 3945.12] And so, you know, the basic creed that all Romans, what united all people throughout the entire huge Roman Empire, was the creed that Caesar is Lord.
[3945.12 → 3945.52] Right?
[3945.52 → 3946.08] Right?
[3946.16 → 3951.22] Every Roman was expected to be able to confess, Caesar is Lord.
[3951.64 → 3952.72] That's what made you a Roman.
[3953.38 → 3961.90] And what they meant by that, was that it recognized Caesar's authority over all, the entire world, essentially.
[3961.90 → 3970.62] And increasingly, in the church, emperor worship was becoming a major challenge for those Christians in Rome.
[3971.74 → 3975.72] And so what Paul is saying here, he's saying, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3976.60 → 3979.24] What he's saying is terribly seditious.
[3979.24 → 3986.04] Because when he's making that statement, Jesus Christ is our Lord, in parentheses, what does it mean?
[3987.46 → 3988.16] Caesar's not.
[3990.26 → 3997.06] At the moment that Jesus rose from the dead, there was a major shift in salvation history.
[3997.56 → 4001.64] Where Jesus is no longer the son of God in humility.
[4002.28 → 4004.58] You know, when Jesus came, he became a man.
[4004.70 → 4006.70] He became like us in weakness.
[4006.70 → 4011.56] He became in the nature of a servant, putting on sinful, in the likeness of man.
[4012.50 → 4014.58] Emptying himself of his divine prerogative.
[4016.02 → 4020.16] But now, in his resurrection, he has become the son of God in power.
[4021.32 → 4028.94] In his resurrection, Jesus proved that he is now the final authority over the whole world.
[4030.00 → 4030.90] He is risen.
[4031.60 → 4034.36] And that means Jesus is not just the saviour of the Jews.
[4034.36 → 4038.60] He is the Lord, the true Lord of all people.
[4038.76 → 4040.68] He is the son of God in power.
[4041.22 → 4042.78] Risen and ascended Lord.
[4043.74 → 4052.52] In every knee, not just, including, even Caesar's knee, will bow before him.
[4052.52 → 4059.64] So the gospel, the good news of salvation, that comes from God, is foretold by the prophets,
[4060.40 → 4071.16] is that God has sent his Messiah into the world to establish his reign as Lord and to redeem his people, both Jews and Gentiles.
[4071.16 → 4073.66] Because he is the Lord over the whole earth.
[4076.46 → 4079.04] And that, as we go on, that leads us to our fourth point.
[4079.14 → 4084.24] The fourth thing that we learn about the gospel, which is that it is comprehensive in scope.
[4085.56 → 4088.62] Okay, so look at with me at verses five and six as he keeps going.
[4088.62 → 4118.60] He says,
[4118.62 → 4120.60] Who is it for?
[4121.44 → 4124.12] It is for every living person.
[4125.18 → 4130.30] Paul says he has received apostleship to call all the Gentiles.
[4130.96 → 4131.12] Right?
[4131.26 → 4133.70] And that means not just some of the Gentiles.
[4134.08 → 4139.36] Not only the richest or more sophisticated urbanites in Rome, them.
[4139.36 → 4143.12] Not the poorest, the oppressed of the Roman Empire.
[4143.74 → 4149.56] Not the nice Gentiles or the most convenient to reach Gentiles.
[4150.04 → 4152.52] But all the Gentiles.
[4152.88 → 4157.50] People from every land, every language, every walk of life, rich and poor.
[4157.50 → 4160.78] Likeable or not.
[4160.78 → 4165.10] Because if Jesus Christ really has died for our sins.
[4165.10 → 4166.96] If he has really been raised from the dead.
[4167.08 → 4168.76] Appointed as the son of God in power.
[4169.00 → 4173.24] The whole world must urgently be called to faith in him.
[4173.24 → 4176.14] And you know, even today.
[4176.72 → 4183.10] There are more people than we often think about and can imagine who have never heard the name of Jesus.
[4184.22 → 4189.68] There are people all over this world today who have never had an opportunity to know the gospel.
[4189.68 → 4192.78] To be invited into this faith.
[4193.10 → 4194.36] To know that he is Lord.
[4194.48 → 4195.58] That he's risen from the dead.
[4195.80 → 4197.08] They've never had the opportunity.
[4199.32 → 4203.06] And Paul is saying that the gospel is comprehensive in scope.
[4203.36 → 4206.02] It's going everywhere to all peoples.
[4207.28 → 4209.70] And that's why he wants to take the gospel to Spain.
[4210.24 → 4210.46] Right?
[4210.66 → 4212.64] Where it hasn't been preached yet.
[4213.34 → 4218.40] It's why he wants the Jews and the Gentiles in the church to see one another as belonging.
[4218.40 → 4220.42] To the family of Christ.
[4221.28 → 4222.80] Because the gospel is comprehensive.
[4222.98 → 4224.46] It's for every living person.
[4226.32 → 4228.50] Then, lastly.
[4229.56 → 4232.54] This final aspect of the gospel that Paul talks about.
[4232.54 → 4237.50] This note that he introduces that will resound throughout the letter.
[4238.36 → 4240.64] Is that the gospel calls us to a new way of life.
[4242.64 → 4244.56] Gospel calls us to a new way of life.
[4244.68 → 4246.82] And we see that in verse 7.
[4246.82 → 4248.90] Where Paul says.
[4249.70 → 4252.50] To all in Rome who are loved by God.
[4253.86 → 4254.36] Right?
[4254.42 → 4256.96] That's a nice reminder.
[4257.84 → 4259.26] Who are loved by God.
[4260.16 → 4263.32] And called to be his holy people.
[4264.44 → 4265.70] Grace and peace to you.
[4265.92 → 4266.84] From God our Father.
[4267.02 → 4268.24] And from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4268.24 → 4268.30] Christ.
[4270.18 → 4275.20] And notice how Paul says we are called to be God's holy people.
[4276.58 → 4279.56] That means, you know, on the one hand, all Christians are holy.
[4279.80 → 4283.04] We've all been set apart as belonging to God.
[4283.04 → 4289.30] But on the other hand, it means that we are being continually, increasingly made holy.
[4290.68 → 4292.74] By the Holy Spirit at work within us.
[4293.94 → 4296.42] You know, and ever since the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[4296.66 → 4299.12] Romans, as you know, has had such a huge.
[4299.76 → 4301.08] Has played such a large role.
[4301.08 → 4306.26] In the kind of the classic formulation of what it means to believe the gospel.
[4306.98 → 4308.12] And it goes something like this.
[4308.14 → 4309.30] You've probably heard it before.
[4309.54 → 4311.16] But the next slide will say this.
[4312.12 → 4313.64] We are saved by faith alone.
[4314.28 → 4318.16] But not by a faith which remains alone.
[4318.96 → 4320.08] Maybe you've heard this.
[4320.08 → 4324.80] And what it means is that true salvation.
[4325.48 → 4326.74] True faith in Christ.
[4328.00 → 4329.62] Results in a changed life.
[4330.20 → 4331.18] It doesn't remain alone.
[4331.40 → 4332.70] It's not like faith is over here.
[4333.06 → 4335.12] But then it doesn't impact the rest of our lives.
[4336.04 → 4338.16] You know, and so we are not saved by keeping the law.
[4338.22 → 4339.76] As we will discover in Romans.
[4340.16 → 4342.60] We're not saved by anything that we can contribute.
[4343.60 → 4346.10] We are saved by what Jesus accomplished for us.
[4346.10 → 4348.48] To secure our redemption.
[4348.68 → 4350.30] Our belonging to Jesus.
[4351.56 → 4353.60] But faith, if it is true faith.
[4354.28 → 4355.94] It never remains just that.
[4356.06 → 4358.20] It blossoms out in obedience.
[4358.94 → 4360.36] In a changed life.
[4362.16 → 4363.42] It's what Paul means earlier.
[4363.96 → 4365.02] In verse 5.
[4365.20 → 4367.88] Where he says he's received apostleship.
[4367.94 → 4371.26] To call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.
[4372.72 → 4372.90] Right?
[4372.94 → 4374.94] It's putting our faith in Christ who died for us.
[4374.94 → 4377.08] And then it means walking in newness of life.
[4378.24 → 4378.38] Right?
[4378.42 → 4381.58] And we were just talking about how the gospel is fundamentally the fact.
[4381.86 → 4383.62] That Jesus Christ is Lord over all.
[4383.66 → 4383.84] Right?
[4384.22 → 4385.18] Jesus is Lord.
[4385.66 → 4387.12] He's Lord over all things.
[4387.66 → 4390.12] And this announcement that we would then hear.
[4390.36 → 4391.24] That calls us to faith.
[4391.48 → 4392.30] Jesus is Lord.
[4392.52 → 4394.52] It provokes in us a response.
[4395.50 → 4396.52] We hear the news.
[4396.84 → 4397.68] Jesus is Lord.
[4398.34 → 4399.66] We have to respond to that.
[4400.36 → 4402.44] And the response for the Christian is.
[4402.44 → 4402.92] Okay.
[4403.60 → 4403.94] Jesus.
[4404.08 → 4405.46] I am placing my faith in you.
[4405.62 → 4407.44] I acknowledge you as Lord of all.
[4407.92 → 4408.88] I am not Lord.
[4409.76 → 4412.52] And I am accepting you as the Lord of my life.
[4413.08 → 4417.02] And that means I give complete allegiance to you.
[4417.02 → 4424.24] And as Jesus then causes that response in us by the Holy Spirit.
[4424.60 → 4427.24] He brings us to our knees before him.
[4427.80 → 4429.68] And then through the spirit of holiness.
[4430.08 → 4432.54] He is going to burst into our lives.
[4433.08 → 4436.74] And he's going to liberate us from all those things that hold us captive.
[4437.54 → 4439.36] And that condemn us.
[4439.36 → 4442.46] And he is also going to reshape us.
[4442.82 → 4445.74] So that we resemble more and more our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4447.10 → 4447.52] And so friends.
[4447.60 → 4448.18] You know what that means?
[4448.28 → 4449.20] That the gospel.
[4449.46 → 4451.12] The announcement of good news.
[4451.56 → 4455.16] Is not just an offer of a different religious option.
[4456.00 → 4458.10] But it is a summons.
[4459.06 → 4460.14] To bow.
[4460.78 → 4463.16] Before the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4463.52 → 4464.76] To see him.
[4464.96 → 4466.70] As the greatest treasure.
[4466.70 → 4467.82] As the most beautiful.
[4467.82 → 4471.80] And for us to place our faith in him.
[4472.18 → 4473.76] And then to be transformed by him.
[4474.72 → 4475.72] That's the gospel.
[4476.62 → 4477.38] So let's pray.
[4480.24 → 4482.74] So Father we come to you.
[4485.54 → 4487.94] Only by the calling that we have received.
[4488.28 → 4489.28] Through your Holy Spirit.
[4490.48 → 4492.94] And it's a calling to surrender our lives.
[4493.44 → 4494.66] And we do so afresh.
[4495.46 → 4495.94] Today.
[4495.94 → 4496.02] Today.
[4496.44 → 4497.88] We surrender to your son.
[4497.88 → 4499.18] Our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4499.94 → 4500.38] Jesus.
[4500.52 → 4501.76] We thank you that even now.
[4501.90 → 4502.86] We belong to you.
[4503.54 → 4505.18] We're secure in you.
[4505.30 → 4506.26] You love us.
[4507.06 → 4508.44] You'll tell us the truth.
[4509.30 → 4511.12] And you won't leave us unchanged.
[4512.74 → 4513.70] And Holy Spirit.
[4513.80 → 4515.18] Would you do that work in our hearts.
[4515.24 → 4515.94] And in our lives.
[4516.80 → 4518.38] Would you help us experience.
[4518.38 → 4519.98] Our belonging in Jesus.
[4519.98 → 4522.36] And it's in his name that we pray.
[4522.46 → 4523.16] And for his sake.
[4523.52 → 4523.96] Amen.
[4527.10 → 4527.54] Okay.
[4527.80 → 4528.56] Let's all stand.
[4528.62 → 4529.86] And we'll sing our song of response.

[5023.18 → 5027.18] So let's turn now our hearts to the Lord in prayer together.
[5027.18 → 5028.18] Let's pray.
[5031.18 → 5038.18] Our Father and our God, we're grateful this morning that you have called us out of darkness into your marvellous light.
[5039.18 → 5049.18] You have desired a people for your own, and we are blessed to be a part of that people here at Ladder CRC.
[5049.18 → 5058.18] You are good Lord and in your goodness you care for us.
[5058.18 → 5062.18] You care for us by giving us your holy word.
[5062.18 → 5075.18] And it was your good pleasure to give us your Holy Spirit to not only teach us the scriptures and how to live in light of them, but also Lord to pray to you.
[5075.18 → 5081.18] And because we are yours, we can draw near to you by your Holy Spirit with confidence.
[5081.18 → 5090.18] And in the confidence that we have in Christ Jesus, we know that we ask things in accordance with his will, and he hears us.
[5090.18 → 5096.18] And so gracious Father, we praise and bless you and adore you for being a God of peace.
[5096.18 → 5100.18] A God who created a world where all things were right.
[5100.18 → 5110.18] And you are a redeemer who is committed to put all things that are broken because of sin and take them and put them right again.
[5111.18 → 5117.18] And until that day, we ask for peace amidst the chaos and the rebellion of our world.
[5117.18 → 5127.18] Please Father grant to those in places of political power your wisdom, whether Lord here in Canada or around the world.
[5128.18 → 5139.18] Lord, we pray for the gospel to go forth into places where people have not yet had the opportunity to hear about Jesus Christ.
[5139.18 → 5150.18] We especially Lord pray for the Umarans today in their work in the Middle East, strengthening churches, calling, being a witness, Lord, to the people of that land.
[5151.18 → 5154.18] A land where Christianity had its very earliest beginnings.
[5155.18 → 5164.18] And Lord, even for those nations further away and in different parts, and even here, Lord, in Lanner, where there are people who don't yet know you.
[5164.18 → 5167.18] Lord, we pray that your gospel would be known.
[5167.18 → 5172.18] Lord, we also pray for thinking about our own church.
[5172.18 → 5174.18] Lord, we pray for families in our church.
[5175.18 → 5185.18] We pray for peace among families, whether between husbands and wives, between parents and children and grandparents.
[5185.18 → 5195.18] And Lord, we would pace and humility and the servant-heartedness of Jesus, would it rule in our homes.
[5198.18 → 5208.18] And for our church family, Lord, we ask for your hand of blessing, especially at this time of year, be with our ministries as they get started up again this fall.
[5208.18 → 5225.18] And as a new year of Sunday school resumes with three classes kind of coming out of the one that we had in the summer, we ask that the children of our church would come to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ and to know your love for them.
[5225.18 → 5230.18] That they would grow in their spiritual understanding and trust in the gospel of Christ.
[5231.18 → 5243.18] Lord, be with the teachers also as they dedicate themselves to this service that can be sometimes tiring, but also, Lord, can be rewarding.
[5243.18 → 5252.18] We also lift to you the needs of our own church family this morning, those that are known to some, those known only by you, Lord.
[5253.18 → 5260.18] But in particular, we pray for Grace Krista, who is still in Delta Hospital with ongoing medical concerns.
[5261.18 → 5266.18] Lord, we pray that you continue to be with Kikuyu as he recovers from his surgery.
[5267.18 → 5271.18] And Lord, continue to be with Jeff and Ashley as they welcome Maya into their home.
[5271.18 → 5275.18] Father, we know that you hear us and that you delight in us.
[5276.18 → 5279.18] And so we bring our petitions to you, and we lay them before you.
[5280.18 → 5286.18] And we ask all of these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, whoever lives to intercede for us.
[5287.18 → 5289.18] And it's in his name that we pray.
[5290.18 → 5291.18] Amen.
[5292.18 → 5293.18] Let's stand.
[5294.18 → 5298.18] And thank you for being here to worship with us today.
[5298.18 → 5304.18] You can join us for a time of fellowship right after the service through the doors in our fellowship hall.
[5305.18 → 5307.18] And now receive the benediction.
[5308.18 → 5310.18] May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5311.18 → 5314.18] May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5315.18 → 5318.18] And may the Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[5318.18 → 5319.18] Amen.
[5319.18 → 5323.18] So remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[5323.18 → 5332.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5332.18 → 5337.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5337.18 → 5339.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5339.18 → 5349.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5350.18 → 5362.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5362.18 → 5365.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5365.18 → 5378.18] Lord, let your light and our feelings to shine upon us.
[5379.18 → 5383.18] Lord, let your light and our thoughts on us.
[5383.18 → 5386.18] Lord, all, let your grace shine upon us.
[5386.18 → 5394.16] Lord, let your praise
[5394.16 → 5399.16] Is our heavenly Lord
[5399.16 → 5407.16] Lord, let your praise
[5407.16 → 5413.18] Is our heavenly Lord
[5413.18 → 5419.18] Let me pray, be safe
[5419.18 → 5426.46] Let me pray, be fine
[5426.46 → 5432.36] With our way, in our desire
[5432.36 → 5438.18] Let me pray, be strong
[5438.18 → 5446.18] Lord, let your praise
[5446.18 → 5449.18] For our way, in our name
[5449.18 → 5451.18] For our way, in our hope
[5451.18 → 5453.18] For our way, in our hope
[5453.18 → 5459.18] Lord, let your praise
[5459.18 → 5466.18] Let our grace
[5466.18 → 5472.18] Let me pray, be safe
[5472.18 → 5489.16] Audi you to
[5489.16 → 5503.98] Amen. We are dismissed.
[5519.16 → 5521.16] Amen.
[5549.16 → 5551.16] Amen.
[5579.16 → 5581.16] Amen.
