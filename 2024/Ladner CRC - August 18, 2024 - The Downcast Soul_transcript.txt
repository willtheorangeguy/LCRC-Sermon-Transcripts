[943.66 --> 946.54]  I want to see you.

[958.16 --> 961.18]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[961.60 --> 964.50]  I want to see you.
[965.50 --> 969.30]  I want to see you.
[970.18 --> 974.14]  I see you high and low below.
[974.14 --> 979.14]  I want to see you.
[980.78 --> 987.66]  Pour out your power and love as we sing, holy, holy, holy.
[987.66 --> 992.14]  Holy, holy, holy.
[993.14 --> 996.46]  Holy, holy, holy.
[997.98 --> 1000.86]  Holy, holy, holy.
[1001.34 --> 1004.24]  I want to see you.
[1004.24 --> 1009.80]  Holy, holy, holy.
[1010.88 --> 1014.44]  Holy, holy, holy.
[1016.04 --> 1019.22]  Holy, holy, holy.
[1019.88 --> 1022.92]  I want to see you.
[1022.92 --> 1033.78]  You may be seated.
[1038.46 --> 1043.18]  So if you have a pew Bible in front of you, you may open it or we can look on the screen.
[1043.18 --> 1046.74]  But our first reading today is from the Gospel of John.
[1049.54 --> 1050.48]  Chapter 4.
[1060.24 --> 1062.48]  So John, chapter 4.
[1062.56 --> 1064.28]  That's on page 791.
[1064.82 --> 1066.88]  791 in your pew Bible.
[1066.88 --> 1071.16]  And we will read verses 4 through 14.
[1075.16 --> 1078.08]  Now he had to go through Samaria.
[1078.58 --> 1086.68]  So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
[1086.68 --> 1088.86]  Jacob's well was there.
[1089.50 --> 1094.62]  And Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well.
[1095.30 --> 1097.22]  It was the sixth hour.
[1098.30 --> 1101.58]  When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,
[1102.14 --> 1103.38]  Will you give me a drink?
[1104.16 --> 1107.02]  His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
[1107.84 --> 1109.64]  The Samaritan woman said to him,
[1110.26 --> 1112.58]  You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman.
[1113.00 --> 1114.50]  How can you ask me for a drink?
[1114.50 --> 1117.96]  For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
[1118.76 --> 1120.44]  Jesus answered her,
[1121.20 --> 1125.90]  If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,
[1126.30 --> 1131.80]  you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
[1133.06 --> 1134.92]  Sir, the woman said,
[1135.64 --> 1138.38]  You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep.
[1138.68 --> 1140.60]  Where can you get this living water?
[1140.60 --> 1144.28]  Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well?
[1144.50 --> 1148.78]  And drink from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and his herds.
[1149.98 --> 1150.78]  Jesus answered,
[1151.00 --> 1154.42]  Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.
[1155.00 --> 1158.58]  But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.
[1159.32 --> 1164.34]  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water,
[1164.86 --> 1167.26]  welling up to eternal life.
[1167.98 --> 1169.14]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1171.70 --> 1175.62]  So let's stand again and we will sing Cornerstone.
[1175.82 --> 1176.32]  Please rise.
[1176.32 --> 1185.30]  Let's sing Cornerstone.
[1185.66 --> 1188.72]  Let's sing рес 75 years.
[1189.22 --> 1197.60]  My hope is built on my think bless.
[1197.60 --> 1202.82]  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[1202.82 --> 1210.66]  I dare not trust the sweetest faith
[1210.66 --> 1217.50]  But holy trust in Jesus' name
[1217.50 --> 1224.56]  Hope is built on nothing else
[1224.56 --> 1229.82]  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[1229.82 --> 1237.68]  I dare not trust the sweetest faith
[1237.68 --> 1244.56]  But holy trust in Jesus' name
[1244.56 --> 1253.44]  Christ alone, born of soul
[1253.44 --> 1260.36]  Weak made strong in Israel's love
[1260.36 --> 1263.96]  Through the storm
[1263.96 --> 1270.44]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[1270.44 --> 1289.02]  When darkness seems to hide His face
[1289.02 --> 1294.96]  I rest on His unchanging prayer
[1294.96 --> 1301.88]  In every time a storm began
[1301.88 --> 1309.48]  My anchor holds within the rest
[1309.48 --> 1316.40]  My anchor holds within the rest
[1316.40 --> 1324.48]  Christ alone, born of soul
[1324.48 --> 1330.28]  Weak made strong in His name
[1330.28 --> 1335.32]  Through the cloud, through the storm
[1335.32 --> 1341.20]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[1341.20 --> 1346.12]  When He shall come with trumpet sound
[1346.12 --> 1359.60]  When He shall come with trumpet sound
[1359.60 --> 1366.16]  O way I dare in Him be found
[1366.16 --> 1372.08]  Dressed in His righteousness alone
[1372.08 --> 1375.08]  Father, Lord of all
[1375.08 --> 1379.00]  Father, please stand before the throne
[1379.00 --> 1408.98]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[1409.00 --> 1410.00]  Rest alone, Lord of all
[1410.00 --> 1415.92]  Rest alone, corner of stone
[1415.92 --> 1419.52]  Weak made strong in this name
[1419.52 --> 1421.52]  In this name of God
[1421.52 --> 1424.44]  Through the storm
[1424.44 --> 1426.52]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[1426.52 --> 1434.52]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[1434.52 --> 1445.52]  Good singing, everyone
[1445.52 --> 1450.64]  So, you know, through God's word
[1450.64 --> 1452.04]  He welcomes us
[1452.04 --> 1454.40]  Each and every one of us
[1454.40 --> 1457.08]  To glorify and to enjoy Him
[1457.08 --> 1459.32]  And it is through His word
[1459.32 --> 1461.56]  That we are also confronted
[1461.56 --> 1464.88]  By our separation from Him
[1464.88 --> 1469.02]  And our need for His forgiveness
[1469.02 --> 1470.98]  And for His mercy in our lives
[1470.98 --> 1474.36]  And we long to be near Him
[1474.36 --> 1474.82]  Right?
[1474.88 --> 1476.72]  We long to be at peace with God
[1476.72 --> 1479.12]  To enter His presence with joy
[1479.12 --> 1479.98]  Unashamed
[1479.98 --> 1484.08]  And aware of our great need
[1484.08 --> 1485.94]  The Lord invites us
[1485.94 --> 1488.12]  He invites us to come before Him
[1488.12 --> 1490.36]  To confess our sins to Him
[1490.36 --> 1492.16]  And to be made clean
[1492.16 --> 1494.70]  And to rest in the cross
[1494.70 --> 1496.80]  And what Jesus has accomplished for us
[1496.80 --> 1498.96]  So let's confess our sins together
[1498.96 --> 1501.60]  In that comfort and assurance
[1501.60 --> 1504.58]  Using this prayer
[1504.58 --> 1506.96]  From Psalm 130
[1506.96 --> 1509.26]  And so the first three verses here
[1509.26 --> 1511.32]  We'll say together out loud
[1511.32 --> 1512.80]  And then I will give you a moment
[1512.80 --> 1514.80]  To silently come before the Lord
[1514.80 --> 1515.74]  In private confession
[1515.74 --> 1519.60]  So let's take Psalm 130
[1519.60 --> 1521.02]  And make it our prayer
[1521.02 --> 1522.50]  Together
[1522.50 --> 1524.58]  Out of the depths
[1524.58 --> 1526.26]  I cry to you, Lord
[1526.26 --> 1528.86]  Lord, hear my voice
[1528.86 --> 1531.14]  Let your ears be attentive
[1531.14 --> 1533.32]  To my cry for mercy
[1533.32 --> 1537.00]  If you, Lord, kept a record of sins
[1537.00 --> 1539.46]  Lord, who could stand?
[1539.46 --> 1541.96]  Give you a time of private
[1541.96 --> 1543.48]  Or silent confession
[1543.48 --> 1567.26]  O Lord, when we consider
[1567.26 --> 1569.32]  Our own sin
[1569.32 --> 1570.38]  The sin of our hearts
[1570.38 --> 1571.60]  The sin of this world
[1571.60 --> 1573.96]  The sin that others have done to us
[1573.96 --> 1575.02]  And that we do to others
[1575.02 --> 1577.84]  Lord, who can stand before you?
[1579.52 --> 1580.96]  But Lord, with you
[1580.96 --> 1582.46]  There is forgiveness
[1582.46 --> 1584.56]  You are a God of mercy
[1584.56 --> 1585.96]  And you have paid the price
[1585.96 --> 1588.60]  Through giving your Son
[1588.60 --> 1589.40]  Our Lord Jesus
[1589.40 --> 1591.98]  To die on the cross
[1591.98 --> 1594.42]  To pay the penalty for our sins
[1594.42 --> 1596.00]  So that through faith in Him
[1596.00 --> 1598.02]  We can stand forgiven
[1598.02 --> 1600.06]  And clothed
[1600.06 --> 1601.46]  Not in our own righteousness
[1601.46 --> 1602.54]  But in the righteousness
[1602.54 --> 1604.24]  Of our Lord Jesus
[1604.24 --> 1605.14]  As a gift
[1605.14 --> 1606.44]  A free gift of grace
[1606.44 --> 1608.14]  So, Lord, we thank you
[1608.14 --> 1608.86]  That this morning
[1608.86 --> 1610.40]  We can be reminded of that
[1610.40 --> 1612.58]  That we can stand before you
[1612.58 --> 1613.26]  In Christ
[1613.26 --> 1614.36]  United to Him
[1614.36 --> 1615.34]  Hidden in Him
[1615.34 --> 1616.82]  And that we can
[1616.82 --> 1618.02]  With joy
[1618.02 --> 1619.42]  Be in your presence
[1619.42 --> 1620.52]  We thank you, Lord
[1620.52 --> 1621.10]  In your name
[1621.10 --> 1621.74]  Amen
[1621.74 --> 1623.82]  Now, hear these words
[1623.82 --> 1624.50]  Of pardon
[1624.50 --> 1625.52]  And these words
[1625.52 --> 1626.24]  Of grace to you
[1626.24 --> 1626.56]  Also
[1626.56 --> 1628.52]  From Psalm 130
[1628.52 --> 1630.74]  I'll read it for us
[1630.74 --> 1632.92]  But with you, Lord
[1632.92 --> 1634.16]  There is forgiveness
[1634.16 --> 1636.04]  So that we can
[1636.04 --> 1636.90]  With reverence
[1636.90 --> 1637.52]  Serve you
[1637.52 --> 1639.56]  I wait for the Lord
[1639.56 --> 1641.62]  My whole being waits
[1641.62 --> 1643.20]  And in His word
[1643.20 --> 1645.02]  I put my hope
[1645.02 --> 1646.02]  So we hope
[1646.02 --> 1647.42]  In God's promises to us
[1647.42 --> 1649.10]  So, family of God
[1649.10 --> 1649.68]  In Christ
[1649.68 --> 1650.88]  You are forgiven
[1650.88 --> 1651.96]  In Christ
[1651.96 --> 1653.34]  You have redemption
[1653.34 --> 1654.50]  Amen
[1654.50 --> 1656.84]  Let's stand again
[1656.84 --> 1658.14]  One more time here
[1658.14 --> 1659.08]  And we will sing
[1659.08 --> 1659.74]  Our next song
[1659.74 --> 1660.48]  As the deer
[1660.48 --> 1661.40]  Let's stand together
[1677.42 --> 1682.48]  As the deer
[1682.48 --> 1684.50]  Depends for
[1684.50 --> 1686.48]  The watch
[1686.48 --> 1688.40]  On my soul
[1688.40 --> 1692.80]  Walked after you
[1692.80 --> 1697.68]  You alone
[1697.68 --> 1699.54]  At my heart
[1699.54 --> 1701.30]  Desired
[1701.30 --> 1703.40]  And I long
[1703.40 --> 1707.08]  To worship you
[1707.08 --> 1712.00]  You alone
[1712.00 --> 1715.96]  I must break my shield
[1715.96 --> 1719.00]  To you alone
[1719.00 --> 1721.90]  Be my spirit
[1721.90 --> 1728.00]  You alone
[1728.00 --> 1730.88]  Are my heart
[1730.88 --> 1732.00]  Desired
[1732.00 --> 1734.00]  And I long
[1734.00 --> 1738.92]  To worship you
[1738.92 --> 1743.92]  You're my friend
[1743.92 --> 1745.88]  And you are
[1745.88 --> 1747.48]  My brother
[1747.48 --> 1751.40]  Even though you are
[1751.40 --> 1752.92]  The King
[1752.92 --> 1757.84]  I love you
[1757.84 --> 1758.34]  I love you
[1758.34 --> 1761.84]  More than any other
[1761.84 --> 1764.04]  So much more
[1764.04 --> 1766.84]  Than anything
[1766.84 --> 1771.76]  You alone
[1771.76 --> 1772.76]  You alone
[1772.76 --> 1775.76]  I must break my shield
[1775.76 --> 1777.76]  To you alone
[1777.76 --> 1778.72]  I must be
[1778.72 --> 1779.76]  You alone
[1779.76 --> 1781.76]  I must be
[1781.76 --> 1783.76]  You alone
[1783.76 --> 1788.68]  You alone
[1788.68 --> 1789.60]  You alone
[1789.60 --> 1791.60]  I must be
[1791.60 --> 1792.60]  You alone
[1792.60 --> 1797.52]  And I long
[1797.52 --> 1807.06]  You alone
[1807.06 --> 1807.18] rie
[1807.18 --> 1809.88]  I hurt you
[1809.88 --> 1812.68]  You can satisfy.
[1815.72 --> 1824.62]  You alone, Father, with joy given and beyond,
[1825.10 --> 1828.22]  O Lord, my God.
[1829.84 --> 1837.22]  You alone, Lord, my strength, my shield.
[1837.22 --> 1844.72]  To you alone, may my spirit be real.
[1847.24 --> 1860.80]  You alone are my heart, desire and I long to worship you.
[1867.22 --> 1877.22]  Okay, at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school class.
[1877.22 --> 1893.20]  So, this summer, we have been looking at some of the Psalms.
[1893.20 --> 1904.76]  And if you're not familiar with the Psalms, they're this amazing collection of 150 poems, songs, and prayers.
[1905.32 --> 1908.06]  And they were actually originally sung.
[1909.10 --> 1913.12]  And they were, you know, we say the song book of Israel.
[1913.12 --> 1920.44]  And just as there are, you know, major and minor key songs in all of our lives,
[1920.64 --> 1925.14]  there are major and minor key songs in the Psalms.
[1925.90 --> 1926.02]  Right?
[1926.12 --> 1930.62]  God's songs give us language that reflects all of life.
[1930.72 --> 1936.88]  The ups and the downs, the major and the minor keys in this beautiful and broken world that we live in.
[1936.88 --> 1941.44]  You know, it's similar to what songwriters do today.
[1941.62 --> 1944.58]  You know, when Princess Diana was killed in 1997,
[1945.28 --> 1952.08]  Elton John captured the feelings of so many people in his song, Candle in the Wind.
[1953.04 --> 1960.16]  And in much the same way, God has filled the Psalms with songs to help us in our time of need.
[1960.16 --> 1965.04]  And that, in songs like Psalm 42.
[1965.70 --> 1968.66]  And so that is the Psalm, you know, Psalm song.
[1968.86 --> 1972.74]  That is the Psalm song that we will say together today.
[1972.94 --> 1979.26]  So open your Bibles, if you would, to Psalm 42 with me.
[1980.12 --> 1982.38]  And we'll begin by looking at Psalm 42.
[1982.38 --> 1987.92]  That is on page 419 in your pew Bible.
[1988.48 --> 1990.38]  Or you can follow along on the screen.
[1990.90 --> 1992.80]  Both are allowed.
[1993.82 --> 1995.08]  So Psalm 42.
[1997.08 --> 2000.76]  As the deer pants for streams of water,
[2001.80 --> 2005.84]  so my soul pants for you, my God.
[2006.72 --> 2010.76]  My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[2010.76 --> 2013.70]  When can I go and meet with God?
[2014.42 --> 2017.44]  My tears have been my food day and night,
[2017.90 --> 2020.52]  while men say to me all day long,
[2020.86 --> 2022.20]  Where is your God?
[2023.26 --> 2026.12]  These things I remember as I pour out my soul,
[2026.46 --> 2028.56]  how I used to go with a multitude,
[2029.22 --> 2031.42]  leading the procession to the house of God,
[2031.88 --> 2036.34]  with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.
[2036.34 --> 2041.04]  Why are you downcast, O my soul?
[2041.70 --> 2043.54]  Why so disturbed within me?
[2044.20 --> 2045.62]  Put your hope in God,
[2046.06 --> 2049.04]  for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
[2049.96 --> 2052.04]  My soul is downcast within me,
[2052.10 --> 2053.62]  therefore I will remember you
[2053.62 --> 2055.36]  from the land of the Jordan,
[2055.52 --> 2056.96]  the heights of Hermon,
[2057.36 --> 2058.48]  from Mount Mizar.
[2059.62 --> 2062.46]  Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls.
[2062.46 --> 2065.40]  All your waves and breakers have swept over me.
[2066.10 --> 2068.28]  By day the Lord directs his love,
[2068.40 --> 2070.12]  at night his song is with me,
[2070.54 --> 2073.52]  a prayer to the God of my life.
[2074.28 --> 2076.04]  I say to God, my rock,
[2076.90 --> 2079.16]  why have you forgotten me?
[2079.86 --> 2081.62]  Why must I go about mourning,
[2081.84 --> 2082.92]  oppressed by the enemy?
[2083.86 --> 2085.90]  My bones suffer mortal agony
[2085.90 --> 2087.76]  as my foes taunt me,
[2088.38 --> 2089.76]  saying to me all day long,
[2089.76 --> 2090.98]  where is your God?
[2092.72 --> 2094.84]  Why are you downcast, O my soul?
[2095.36 --> 2097.08]  Why so disturbed within me?
[2097.56 --> 2098.68]  Put your hope in God,
[2099.10 --> 2100.66]  for I will yet praise him,
[2101.12 --> 2103.60]  my Savior and my God.
[2104.46 --> 2105.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2108.00 --> 2109.02]  Let's pray together.
[2109.56 --> 2111.26]  Ask for God's blessing upon the preaching
[2111.26 --> 2113.48]  and the reading of his word.
[2113.76 --> 2114.42]  Heavenly Father,
[2114.54 --> 2116.76]  would you meet with us this morning
[2116.76 --> 2118.74]  in your word?
[2119.70 --> 2121.04]  Lord, would you speak to us?
[2121.14 --> 2122.12]  Would you teach us,
[2122.30 --> 2123.32]  direct us,
[2123.50 --> 2126.84]  and shine the light of your truth
[2126.84 --> 2127.90]  into our hearts
[2127.90 --> 2130.10]  by the working of your Holy Spirit?
[2130.72 --> 2132.04]  We ask in Jesus' name
[2132.04 --> 2132.92]  and for his sake.
[2133.32 --> 2133.70]  Amen.
[2135.00 --> 2136.36]  So as you may have noticed,
[2136.50 --> 2138.76]  Psalm 42 is what we call
[2138.76 --> 2140.72]  a psalm of lament.
[2141.60 --> 2143.22]  It's one of those psalms
[2143.22 --> 2145.64]  that is written in the minor key.
[2145.64 --> 2149.14]  And the chorus of the song,
[2149.18 --> 2149.32]  you know,
[2149.36 --> 2150.58]  every good song has a chorus.
[2150.76 --> 2153.12]  Well, the chorus of this song
[2153.12 --> 2155.60]  appears twice in Psalm 42.
[2155.92 --> 2157.56]  In verse 5 and verse 11,
[2157.62 --> 2158.28]  you may have noticed,
[2158.40 --> 2159.10]  it repeats.
[2160.84 --> 2162.50]  And this is what he writes,
[2162.56 --> 2163.54]  where the psalmist says,
[2164.10 --> 2165.28]  why, my soul,
[2165.40 --> 2167.38]  are you downcast?
[2167.48 --> 2170.52]  Why so disturbed within me?
[2171.58 --> 2172.10]  You know,
[2172.14 --> 2173.66]  I don't know how accurate this is,
[2173.66 --> 2174.78]  but I heard somewhere
[2174.78 --> 2177.70]  that kind of statistically speaking,
[2178.30 --> 2179.46]  half the population
[2179.46 --> 2181.12]  has a natural disposition
[2181.12 --> 2183.04]  towards being more happy,
[2183.74 --> 2185.80]  while the other half
[2185.80 --> 2188.82]  tends to be more gloomy.
[2190.20 --> 2191.74]  I'm more of the latter,
[2192.00 --> 2192.74]  the gloomier side.
[2192.88 --> 2193.14]  I don't know.
[2193.22 --> 2194.06]  How about you all?
[2194.10 --> 2194.86]  Are you more happy?
[2194.98 --> 2195.20]  Happy?
[2195.28 --> 2195.88]  Raise your hand.
[2196.54 --> 2196.90]  Happy?
[2197.54 --> 2198.02]  A lot.
[2198.20 --> 2198.78]  How about gloomy?
[2198.78 --> 2202.66]  Hey, we're in the boat together,
[2202.94 --> 2203.22]  you know.
[2203.46 --> 2203.98]  Okay.
[2205.24 --> 2205.62]  Well,
[2205.98 --> 2207.70]  maybe some of you didn't vote.
[2209.08 --> 2209.82]  But, you know,
[2209.86 --> 2212.24]  aside from our internal dispositions,
[2212.78 --> 2212.98]  you know,
[2213.02 --> 2213.90]  of either being happier
[2213.90 --> 2214.78]  or more sad,
[2215.20 --> 2216.58]  nobody is immune
[2216.58 --> 2219.16]  to being spiritually downcast.
[2219.88 --> 2220.02]  Right?
[2220.08 --> 2221.22]  Even if you're, you know,
[2221.26 --> 2223.10]  very emotionally even-keeled,
[2223.32 --> 2224.38]  you're not immune
[2224.38 --> 2225.52]  to feeling sad
[2225.52 --> 2225.78]  and downcast
[2225.78 --> 2227.32]  at times.
[2228.24 --> 2228.56]  And so,
[2228.74 --> 2228.98]  therefore,
[2229.12 --> 2230.20]  we have to ask ourselves,
[2230.40 --> 2231.14]  what happens
[2231.14 --> 2233.18]  when you are feeling downcast?
[2233.96 --> 2235.12]  What happens
[2235.12 --> 2236.38]  when your soul
[2236.38 --> 2239.54]  is feeling spiritually wrecked?
[2240.56 --> 2242.46]  And we find the answer
[2242.46 --> 2244.50]  to that here in Psalm 42.
[2245.52 --> 2245.74]  And so,
[2245.80 --> 2246.96]  as we look at Psalm 42,
[2247.18 --> 2248.00]  we're going to see
[2248.00 --> 2250.24]  just two very simple things
[2250.24 --> 2250.92]  this morning.
[2252.06 --> 2253.20]  The cause
[2253.20 --> 2254.88]  and the cure.
[2254.88 --> 2255.84]  Okay.
[2255.88 --> 2256.66]  The cause
[2256.66 --> 2258.50]  of a downcast soul
[2258.50 --> 2260.46]  than the cure
[2260.46 --> 2262.02]  for a downcast soul.
[2262.12 --> 2262.24]  Okay.
[2262.30 --> 2263.24]  Two very simple things
[2263.24 --> 2263.74]  this morning.
[2264.20 --> 2264.74]  So,
[2264.78 --> 2266.00]  let's start first
[2266.00 --> 2267.14]  the cause
[2267.14 --> 2268.96]  of a downcast soul.
[2269.76 --> 2271.12]  And we begin,
[2271.28 --> 2271.50]  right,
[2271.66 --> 2272.26]  in the beginning
[2272.26 --> 2274.00]  in verses 1 and 2.
[2274.14 --> 2274.32]  So,
[2274.40 --> 2275.38]  let's read that again together.
[2275.72 --> 2276.96]  As the deer pants
[2276.96 --> 2278.14]  for streams of water,
[2278.76 --> 2279.96]  so my soul pants
[2279.96 --> 2280.32]  for you,
[2280.38 --> 2280.88]  my God,
[2280.96 --> 2281.74]  my soul thirsts
[2281.74 --> 2282.20]  for God,
[2282.34 --> 2283.42]  for the living God.
[2283.42 --> 2285.24]  When can I go
[2285.24 --> 2287.30]  and meet with God?
[2288.30 --> 2290.26]  The picture we have here
[2290.26 --> 2293.56]  is not of a frolicking fawn
[2293.56 --> 2295.48]  thirsty after a day of play.
[2295.68 --> 2295.78]  Right?
[2295.84 --> 2297.10]  This is not a Disney film.
[2297.56 --> 2298.66]  This is a picture
[2298.66 --> 2299.42]  of a deer
[2299.42 --> 2301.08]  that is close to death.
[2301.82 --> 2303.14]  It is panting.
[2303.46 --> 2304.46]  It is desperate
[2304.46 --> 2305.96]  for the water
[2305.96 --> 2307.14]  that it needs
[2307.14 --> 2308.38]  to live.
[2308.38 --> 2312.12]  What's the author saying?
[2312.26 --> 2313.00]  He's saying,
[2313.68 --> 2316.06]  I need God.
[2316.16 --> 2317.04]  I am desperate
[2317.04 --> 2318.18]  for God.
[2318.50 --> 2319.10]  I need God
[2319.10 --> 2320.76]  like a distressed deer
[2320.76 --> 2322.00]  needs water.
[2322.88 --> 2324.40]  And only the presence
[2324.40 --> 2325.40]  of the living God
[2325.40 --> 2326.22]  himself
[2326.22 --> 2328.26]  is able to satisfy
[2328.26 --> 2329.30]  this deep longing
[2329.30 --> 2330.44]  that I have
[2330.44 --> 2331.88]  and give me life,
[2331.96 --> 2333.14]  the life that I need.
[2333.14 --> 2333.58]  Now,
[2334.84 --> 2335.66]  to give the psalm
[2335.66 --> 2336.62]  some context,
[2337.28 --> 2337.44]  you know,
[2337.50 --> 2338.32]  it doesn't tell us
[2338.32 --> 2339.22]  who the author is.
[2339.30 --> 2339.52]  Maybe,
[2339.62 --> 2339.74]  you know,
[2339.78 --> 2340.28]  at the beginning
[2340.28 --> 2340.88]  it says,
[2341.24 --> 2342.72]  of the sons of Korah,
[2342.80 --> 2344.02]  maybe he was a worship leader.
[2344.36 --> 2344.90]  Some people say
[2344.90 --> 2345.62]  maybe it was David.
[2345.74 --> 2346.32]  We don't know.
[2347.44 --> 2347.82]  But,
[2348.60 --> 2351.62]  we do have some clues
[2351.62 --> 2352.64]  in the psalm
[2352.64 --> 2354.16]  about what's going on
[2354.16 --> 2355.14]  in the author's life.
[2355.84 --> 2356.24]  So,
[2356.34 --> 2356.84]  for one,
[2356.92 --> 2357.86]  we know exactly
[2357.86 --> 2359.02]  where he is.
[2359.02 --> 2362.34]  because of what
[2362.34 --> 2363.44]  he writes in
[2363.44 --> 2364.86]  verse 6
[2364.86 --> 2366.02]  about Mount Hermon
[2366.02 --> 2367.06]  and the headwaters
[2367.06 --> 2367.82]  of the Jordan River.
[2367.96 --> 2369.16]  We know geographically
[2369.16 --> 2369.84]  where he is.
[2370.62 --> 2370.92]  So,
[2370.98 --> 2371.64]  we know he's in
[2371.64 --> 2372.46]  northern Palestine
[2372.46 --> 2373.82]  and that means
[2373.82 --> 2374.66]  he is far away
[2374.66 --> 2375.44]  from Jerusalem
[2375.44 --> 2376.58]  which is further south.
[2377.30 --> 2377.82]  Possibly,
[2377.94 --> 2378.76]  he's in exile.
[2379.76 --> 2380.14]  And so,
[2380.22 --> 2381.20]  he's no longer able
[2381.20 --> 2382.38]  to worship in Jerusalem
[2382.38 --> 2383.24]  at the temple.
[2383.92 --> 2384.86]  He is away
[2384.86 --> 2385.84]  from his community.
[2386.04 --> 2386.26]  Remember,
[2386.34 --> 2387.04]  he talks about
[2387.04 --> 2388.36]  when he was
[2388.36 --> 2389.38]  there in Jerusalem
[2389.38 --> 2390.26]  worshiping with
[2390.26 --> 2391.26]  the people of God
[2391.26 --> 2392.38]  but now he's away
[2392.38 --> 2393.22]  from his community.
[2393.62 --> 2394.82]  He's away from his home.
[2395.44 --> 2395.64]  And so,
[2395.74 --> 2396.38]  he's writing
[2396.38 --> 2398.20]  from a place
[2398.20 --> 2400.34]  of deep despair
[2400.34 --> 2401.68]  and sadness.
[2402.96 --> 2403.06]  Right?
[2403.14 --> 2404.42]  He's distraught
[2404.42 --> 2405.40]  because he no longer
[2405.40 --> 2406.56]  has access
[2406.56 --> 2408.38]  to the sanctuary
[2408.38 --> 2409.42]  to worship God.
[2410.16 --> 2410.54]  And,
[2410.62 --> 2411.96]  because that's where
[2411.96 --> 2413.28]  God met with his people
[2413.28 --> 2414.32]  in the Old Testament
[2414.32 --> 2414.98]  at the temple,
[2415.70 --> 2416.40]  he feels that
[2416.40 --> 2417.48]  he's lost nearness
[2417.48 --> 2417.92]  to God.
[2417.92 --> 2418.94]  He feels far away
[2418.94 --> 2419.54]  from God.
[2420.62 --> 2421.26]  And that's why
[2421.26 --> 2422.30]  he says in verse 2,
[2422.92 --> 2423.80]  when can I go
[2423.80 --> 2425.00]  and meet with God?
[2425.10 --> 2425.70]  When can I go
[2425.70 --> 2427.02]  and see him
[2427.02 --> 2427.96]  face to face?
[2429.72 --> 2430.32]  And so,
[2430.40 --> 2431.16]  his soul
[2431.16 --> 2433.16]  is feeling
[2433.16 --> 2434.88]  spiritually parched.
[2435.04 --> 2436.10]  It's feeling dry.
[2436.76 --> 2437.40]  He's desperate
[2437.40 --> 2438.42]  to be in God's presence
[2438.42 --> 2439.12]  but he feels like
[2439.12 --> 2440.78]  God is far away
[2440.78 --> 2441.20]  from him.
[2442.54 --> 2442.84]  And so,
[2442.90 --> 2443.60]  the psalmist says,
[2443.70 --> 2444.20]  my soul
[2444.20 --> 2445.10]  pants for you,
[2445.18 --> 2445.62]  my soul
[2445.62 --> 2446.60]  thirsts for you,
[2446.60 --> 2447.66]  for the living God
[2447.66 --> 2449.24]  because you are
[2449.24 --> 2450.60]  the only source
[2450.60 --> 2451.36]  of life
[2451.36 --> 2452.48]  in living water.
[2453.56 --> 2454.72]  And the thing is,
[2454.80 --> 2456.40]  every single human being,
[2456.58 --> 2457.58]  every one of us,
[2458.00 --> 2458.66]  whether you believe
[2458.66 --> 2459.50]  in God or not,
[2460.16 --> 2461.62]  our souls need God.
[2462.32 --> 2462.56]  Right?
[2462.62 --> 2463.92]  Just as a dying deer
[2463.92 --> 2464.52]  needs water.
[2465.10 --> 2466.70]  This is the fundamental
[2466.70 --> 2467.26]  longing
[2467.26 --> 2468.92]  that drives us
[2468.92 --> 2470.10]  as human beings.
[2470.56 --> 2471.30]  This thirst
[2471.30 --> 2472.06]  for God.
[2472.06 --> 2472.10]  God.
[2472.98 --> 2473.36]  So,
[2473.40 --> 2474.44]  here's how C.S. Lewis
[2474.44 --> 2475.28]  writes about
[2475.28 --> 2476.00]  this longing
[2476.00 --> 2476.78]  that we all have
[2476.78 --> 2477.18]  for God.
[2478.04 --> 2478.84]  He says this,
[2479.84 --> 2480.88]  most people,
[2481.44 --> 2482.32]  if they really
[2482.32 --> 2483.48]  learned to look
[2483.48 --> 2484.44]  into their own
[2484.44 --> 2484.90]  hearts,
[2485.62 --> 2486.24]  would know
[2486.24 --> 2486.90]  that they,
[2487.46 --> 2488.98]  would know
[2488.98 --> 2490.44]  that they do want
[2490.44 --> 2491.76]  and want acutely
[2491.76 --> 2493.06]  something that
[2493.06 --> 2494.20]  cannot be had
[2494.20 --> 2495.10]  in this world.
[2495.94 --> 2496.92]  There are all
[2496.92 --> 2497.84]  sorts of things
[2497.84 --> 2498.56]  in this world
[2498.56 --> 2499.18]  that offer
[2499.18 --> 2500.06]  to give it to you
[2500.06 --> 2501.50]  but they never
[2501.50 --> 2502.38]  quite keep
[2502.38 --> 2503.04]  their promise.
[2504.42 --> 2505.22]  Then he says,
[2505.90 --> 2506.50]  if I find
[2506.50 --> 2507.20]  in myself
[2507.20 --> 2507.92]  a desire
[2507.92 --> 2508.98]  which no experience
[2508.98 --> 2509.86]  in this world
[2509.86 --> 2510.70]  can satisfy,
[2511.48 --> 2512.54]  the most probable
[2512.54 --> 2513.26]  explanation
[2513.26 --> 2514.70]  is that I was
[2514.70 --> 2515.16]  made
[2515.16 --> 2516.68]  for another world.
[2518.26 --> 2519.50]  It's a great quote.
[2520.02 --> 2520.14]  You know,
[2520.24 --> 2520.70]  and he's saying,
[2520.78 --> 2520.86]  you know,
[2520.90 --> 2522.04]  this desire that we have
[2522.04 --> 2522.68]  and we try to
[2522.68 --> 2523.62]  meet that desire
[2523.62 --> 2524.64]  with all kinds of things
[2524.64 --> 2525.12]  in this world,
[2525.18 --> 2526.12]  even good things,
[2526.46 --> 2527.52]  but they always leave us
[2527.52 --> 2528.32]  just a little bit empty.
[2528.44 --> 2530.04]  They never truly satisfy us.
[2530.58 --> 2531.16]  And so he says,
[2531.24 --> 2531.36]  well,
[2531.40 --> 2532.44]  if there's this desire
[2532.44 --> 2533.54]  that we have
[2533.54 --> 2534.38]  that nothing in this world
[2534.38 --> 2535.00]  can satisfy,
[2535.22 --> 2536.60]  maybe the object
[2536.60 --> 2537.36]  of our desire
[2537.36 --> 2538.62]  is not something
[2538.62 --> 2539.18]  we can find
[2539.18 --> 2539.82]  in this world.
[2540.10 --> 2540.78]  And he's saying,
[2540.94 --> 2542.14]  it is God himself.
[2543.62 --> 2544.50]  And this is what
[2544.50 --> 2545.06]  the psalmist
[2545.06 --> 2546.00]  is saying as well.
[2546.08 --> 2547.00]  We have this thirst
[2547.00 --> 2547.56]  in our souls
[2547.56 --> 2548.60]  that only God
[2548.60 --> 2549.54]  can satisfy.
[2550.42 --> 2551.18]  And some of you
[2551.18 --> 2551.86]  here this morning,
[2551.96 --> 2552.08]  you know,
[2552.12 --> 2553.24]  maybe you came this morning
[2553.24 --> 2554.58]  and you have a strong
[2554.58 --> 2555.98]  sense of that
[2555.98 --> 2556.62]  even today.
[2557.50 --> 2558.42]  You might have come
[2558.42 --> 2558.96]  this morning
[2558.96 --> 2560.68]  maybe having tried
[2560.68 --> 2562.00]  to satisfy this desire
[2562.00 --> 2562.62]  and all kinds
[2562.62 --> 2563.36]  of different things,
[2563.52 --> 2564.08]  but you've come
[2564.08 --> 2564.70]  to the end
[2564.70 --> 2565.50]  of your ropes.
[2566.62 --> 2567.38]  And this psalm
[2567.38 --> 2567.92]  tells us
[2567.92 --> 2568.64]  that it's only
[2568.64 --> 2569.44]  the living God
[2569.44 --> 2570.54]  who can quench
[2570.54 --> 2571.64]  that thirst
[2571.64 --> 2572.40]  of our souls.
[2573.12 --> 2573.76]  And so that's
[2573.76 --> 2574.64]  the first cause
[2574.64 --> 2575.34]  that we see here
[2575.34 --> 2577.42]  for a downcast soul.
[2577.80 --> 2577.98]  Right?
[2578.02 --> 2578.66]  We feel that God
[2578.66 --> 2579.36]  is far away.
[2579.48 --> 2580.42]  We're separated
[2580.42 --> 2580.90]  from God.
[2581.00 --> 2581.90]  Where is God?
[2581.90 --> 2582.76]  We have this
[2582.76 --> 2584.54]  unquenched thirst
[2584.54 --> 2586.04]  in our souls
[2586.04 --> 2586.90]  and it makes us feel
[2586.90 --> 2587.66]  just spiritually
[2587.66 --> 2589.46]  downcast and dry.
[2590.62 --> 2592.26]  Now the second cause
[2592.26 --> 2594.10]  of a downcast soul
[2594.10 --> 2594.82]  that we find
[2594.82 --> 2595.96]  here is
[2595.96 --> 2596.76]  in verse 3.
[2597.76 --> 2598.56]  So look at it
[2598.56 --> 2598.98]  with me.
[2599.90 --> 2600.32]  He says,
[2600.44 --> 2601.08]  My tears
[2601.08 --> 2602.30]  have been my food
[2602.30 --> 2603.30]  day and night
[2603.30 --> 2604.20]  while people
[2604.20 --> 2604.92]  say to me
[2604.92 --> 2605.96]  all day long,
[2606.16 --> 2607.94]  where is your God?
[2609.44 --> 2610.02]  And so what's
[2610.02 --> 2610.76]  the psalmist saying?
[2611.74 --> 2612.40]  He's saying
[2612.40 --> 2613.52]  that he has enemies
[2613.52 --> 2615.46]  and that these enemies
[2615.46 --> 2616.74]  have voices
[2616.74 --> 2618.94]  and that these voices
[2618.94 --> 2621.38]  mock and ridicule
[2621.38 --> 2622.44]  and they say,
[2622.64 --> 2623.86]  Where is your God?
[2625.20 --> 2626.06]  Now maybe,
[2626.22 --> 2626.32]  you know,
[2626.34 --> 2627.28]  we might imagine,
[2627.48 --> 2628.00]  you know,
[2628.02 --> 2629.10]  a sort of entourage
[2629.10 --> 2629.94]  of hecklers
[2629.94 --> 2631.16]  kind of following
[2631.16 --> 2632.28]  the psalmist around,
[2632.72 --> 2634.08]  increasing his misery.
[2634.86 --> 2635.70]  And that does
[2635.70 --> 2636.42]  sometimes happen,
[2636.50 --> 2636.64]  right?
[2636.68 --> 2637.36]  Just go online.
[2638.30 --> 2639.78]  But it could be
[2639.78 --> 2640.94]  that the psalmist
[2640.94 --> 2641.58]  is describing
[2641.58 --> 2642.82]  just like what it is
[2642.82 --> 2643.96]  to have hope
[2643.96 --> 2644.86]  and a longing
[2644.86 --> 2645.64]  for God
[2645.64 --> 2646.52]  in a world
[2646.52 --> 2648.20]  that rejects him.
[2648.92 --> 2649.92]  He's got this longing
[2649.92 --> 2650.38]  for God
[2650.38 --> 2651.44]  but he feels alone
[2651.44 --> 2652.20]  in this longing
[2652.20 --> 2653.12]  and there's this world
[2653.12 --> 2654.36]  that is like,
[2654.50 --> 2654.76]  you know,
[2654.84 --> 2655.62]  where is your God?
[2655.68 --> 2656.46]  There is no God.
[2656.62 --> 2657.24]  You're looking
[2657.24 --> 2658.14]  in the wrong place.
[2658.20 --> 2658.56]  You're looking
[2658.56 --> 2659.60]  at a dry rock.
[2659.68 --> 2660.62]  There's no water there.
[2663.42 --> 2664.94]  And he cries about it,
[2665.42 --> 2665.68]  right?
[2665.78 --> 2666.44]  He says,
[2666.50 --> 2667.06]  My tears
[2667.06 --> 2668.14]  have been my food
[2668.14 --> 2669.14]  day and night.
[2669.50 --> 2671.24]  He's crying nonstop.
[2672.02 --> 2672.38]  You know,
[2672.40 --> 2673.34]  imagine his shirt
[2673.34 --> 2673.78]  is wet,
[2673.88 --> 2674.50]  his sleeves
[2674.50 --> 2674.92]  are wet,
[2675.06 --> 2675.76]  his face
[2675.76 --> 2676.38]  is drenched,
[2676.50 --> 2676.96]  his tears
[2676.96 --> 2677.52]  are like running
[2677.52 --> 2678.54]  into his mouth.
[2679.24 --> 2679.72]  It's this very
[2679.72 --> 2680.70]  kind of vivid image.
[2682.88 --> 2684.46]  And truth be told,
[2684.58 --> 2685.46]  the only reason
[2685.46 --> 2686.22]  that question,
[2686.28 --> 2686.74]  that question,
[2686.86 --> 2687.90]  where is your God?
[2688.36 --> 2689.40]  The only reason
[2689.40 --> 2690.86]  it stings so deeply
[2690.86 --> 2692.30]  is because
[2692.30 --> 2693.24]  it resonates
[2693.24 --> 2694.46]  so deeply
[2694.46 --> 2696.48]  in our own doubts.
[2697.56 --> 2698.36]  And the psalmist,
[2699.30 --> 2700.66]  I think two or three times,
[2700.74 --> 2701.34]  he basically
[2701.34 --> 2702.52]  asked the same question
[2702.52 --> 2703.08]  himself.
[2704.04 --> 2705.06]  Like in verse 9,
[2705.16 --> 2705.80]  he says,
[2706.56 --> 2707.34]  I say,
[2707.76 --> 2708.42]  do we have it?
[2708.82 --> 2710.06]  I say to my God,
[2710.46 --> 2711.30]  to God my rock,
[2711.64 --> 2712.56]  why have you
[2712.56 --> 2713.28]  forgotten me?
[2714.28 --> 2715.46]  Why must I go around
[2715.46 --> 2715.90]  mourning
[2715.90 --> 2716.98]  oppressed by the enemy?
[2717.12 --> 2717.24]  You know,
[2717.30 --> 2718.32]  why have you forgotten me?
[2718.42 --> 2719.96]  Where is your God?
[2720.02 --> 2720.76]  It's the same thing.
[2720.76 --> 2724.48]  And so,
[2724.60 --> 2725.76]  hearing these voices
[2725.76 --> 2726.58]  of his,
[2726.70 --> 2727.80]  these mockers,
[2728.46 --> 2729.80]  it just compounds
[2729.80 --> 2730.96]  what he's already feeling.
[2731.24 --> 2732.66]  That God has forgotten him,
[2732.70 --> 2733.72]  that God is not there.
[2734.88 --> 2736.06]  And this is a problem
[2736.06 --> 2737.78]  because those are not
[2737.78 --> 2738.38]  the voices
[2738.38 --> 2739.16]  that we were made
[2739.16 --> 2739.82]  to listen to.
[2740.28 --> 2740.50]  Right?
[2740.54 --> 2741.12]  We were made
[2741.12 --> 2742.30]  to listen to the voice
[2742.30 --> 2742.78]  of God.
[2743.78 --> 2743.98]  You know,
[2744.02 --> 2745.12]  think back to our first,
[2745.44 --> 2746.30]  the first human beings,
[2746.42 --> 2746.98]  Adam and Eve,
[2747.04 --> 2747.60]  in the garden
[2747.60 --> 2748.88]  where God says to them,
[2749.28 --> 2749.50]  you know,
[2749.54 --> 2749.82]  look,
[2749.90 --> 2750.12]  you were,
[2750.12 --> 2751.90]  I made you in my image.
[2752.14 --> 2752.90]  I love you.
[2753.04 --> 2753.92]  I've made this world
[2753.92 --> 2755.04]  for you to live in.
[2755.68 --> 2756.44]  I made you to be
[2756.44 --> 2757.12]  in my presence
[2757.12 --> 2758.52]  and to listen to my voice.
[2759.78 --> 2760.80]  Or think about
[2760.80 --> 2761.60]  God's voice
[2761.60 --> 2762.64]  to the Samaritan woman
[2762.64 --> 2763.56]  that we read earlier
[2763.56 --> 2765.42]  in John chapter 4.
[2765.52 --> 2766.12]  Jesus says,
[2766.12 --> 2767.14]  if you knew
[2767.14 --> 2768.78]  who was speaking to you,
[2769.72 --> 2770.04]  if you,
[2770.48 --> 2771.24]  in other words,
[2771.80 --> 2773.48]  if you recognize my voice,
[2774.48 --> 2775.58]  you would listen
[2775.58 --> 2777.56]  and you would ask me
[2777.56 --> 2778.58]  for water.
[2778.58 --> 2781.28]  But we don't hear
[2781.28 --> 2782.16]  the voice of God.
[2783.24 --> 2783.60]  Friends,
[2783.72 --> 2784.54]  you and I
[2784.54 --> 2785.08]  were made
[2785.08 --> 2786.02]  to hear the voice
[2786.02 --> 2786.34]  of God,
[2786.40 --> 2787.32]  to listen to the voice
[2787.32 --> 2787.76]  of God.
[2788.34 --> 2789.50]  But the voice of God,
[2789.56 --> 2790.34]  for so many of us,
[2790.36 --> 2791.48]  it gets drowned out
[2791.48 --> 2793.46]  by so many other voices.
[2793.80 --> 2793.94]  You know,
[2794.00 --> 2794.82]  these other voices
[2794.82 --> 2796.60]  that are trying
[2796.60 --> 2797.80]  to interpret life
[2797.80 --> 2798.36]  for us,
[2798.38 --> 2798.94]  to tell us
[2798.94 --> 2799.62]  what to believe,
[2799.86 --> 2800.78]  what's important,
[2800.90 --> 2801.52]  what's valuable,
[2801.92 --> 2802.96]  and that these voices
[2802.96 --> 2804.28]  also offer life
[2804.28 --> 2805.12]  to us
[2805.12 --> 2806.58]  in things
[2806.58 --> 2807.46]  other than God.
[2809.38 --> 2809.90]  And so that's
[2809.90 --> 2810.80]  the second cause
[2810.80 --> 2812.46]  of a downcast soul
[2812.46 --> 2813.74]  is just listening
[2813.74 --> 2814.54]  to these voices
[2814.54 --> 2815.10]  of doubt.
[2816.34 --> 2816.48]  Okay,
[2816.56 --> 2816.78]  so,
[2817.38 --> 2818.12]  kind of to summarize,
[2818.32 --> 2819.10]  we've talked about
[2819.10 --> 2820.20]  the causes
[2820.20 --> 2821.66]  in Psalm 42,
[2821.82 --> 2822.20]  at least,
[2822.32 --> 2823.32]  of a downcast soul.
[2823.66 --> 2824.10]  The psalmist
[2824.10 --> 2825.22]  is distraught,
[2825.42 --> 2826.20]  he's sad,
[2826.28 --> 2827.56]  he's spiritually depressed,
[2827.56 --> 2829.68]  and the reason is,
[2830.04 --> 2831.04]  he's got this
[2831.04 --> 2832.34]  unquenched thirst
[2832.34 --> 2832.82]  for God.
[2833.54 --> 2834.42]  He longs to be
[2834.42 --> 2835.14]  in God's presence,
[2835.88 --> 2836.42]  but he feels
[2836.42 --> 2837.46]  that God has forgotten him.
[2838.42 --> 2839.42]  And then not only that,
[2839.48 --> 2840.02]  but he's forced
[2840.02 --> 2841.48]  to listen to these voices
[2841.48 --> 2843.38]  of this unbelieving world
[2843.38 --> 2844.38]  saying to him,
[2844.46 --> 2845.44]  where is your God?
[2846.04 --> 2846.90]  And mocking him.
[2849.64 --> 2850.82]  But here's the thing,
[2850.88 --> 2852.28]  here's the good news
[2852.28 --> 2853.20]  in this passage,
[2853.20 --> 2854.74]  that Psalm 42,
[2854.90 --> 2855.60]  it doesn't just
[2855.60 --> 2856.90]  tell us the cause,
[2856.90 --> 2857.56]  you know,
[2857.60 --> 2858.38]  causes that we can
[2858.38 --> 2859.24]  relate to maybe,
[2859.98 --> 2861.38]  but also it gives us
[2861.38 --> 2861.86]  the cure.
[2862.56 --> 2862.68]  Okay,
[2862.68 --> 2863.54]  not just the cause
[2863.54 --> 2864.34]  of a downcast soul,
[2864.42 --> 2864.96]  but the cure.
[2865.06 --> 2865.70]  And that's our second
[2865.70 --> 2866.32]  point today.
[2866.78 --> 2867.48]  The cure
[2867.48 --> 2869.08]  for a downcast soul.
[2870.94 --> 2872.68]  And what the psalmist
[2872.68 --> 2874.30]  says for us to do
[2874.30 --> 2876.44]  is to pour out
[2876.44 --> 2877.28]  our souls
[2877.28 --> 2878.68]  in two different
[2878.68 --> 2879.28]  directions.
[2879.98 --> 2881.08]  We're to pour out
[2881.08 --> 2882.42]  our souls to God,
[2882.42 --> 2884.56]  and we are to pour out
[2884.56 --> 2885.26]  our souls
[2885.26 --> 2886.88]  to ourselves.
[2887.26 --> 2887.40]  Okay,
[2887.44 --> 2887.94]  so we'll talk
[2887.94 --> 2888.62]  about those things.
[2888.70 --> 2889.20]  So first,
[2889.54 --> 2890.42]  first thing he says
[2890.42 --> 2891.34]  is we need to talk
[2891.34 --> 2891.76]  to God.
[2892.34 --> 2893.52]  We need to pour out
[2893.52 --> 2894.24]  our souls
[2894.24 --> 2895.34]  to God
[2895.34 --> 2896.40]  when we are feeling
[2896.40 --> 2897.36]  downcast.
[2898.02 --> 2898.46]  Now,
[2898.54 --> 2899.44]  remember in verse
[2899.44 --> 2899.88]  one,
[2900.28 --> 2900.84]  he says,
[2900.94 --> 2901.56]  as the deer
[2901.56 --> 2902.52]  pants for water,
[2902.72 --> 2903.50]  so my soul
[2903.50 --> 2904.32]  pants for
[2904.32 --> 2905.92]  you,
[2906.16 --> 2907.04]  my God.
[2907.10 --> 2907.28]  Right?
[2907.42 --> 2908.14]  And so,
[2908.30 --> 2909.60]  he's addressing God,
[2909.68 --> 2910.82]  he's praying to God.
[2911.40 --> 2912.12]  My soul longs
[2912.12 --> 2912.72]  for you,
[2913.04 --> 2913.38]  God.
[2913.38 --> 2913.42]  God,
[2915.70 --> 2916.30]  it's then,
[2916.40 --> 2916.98]  so much of what
[2916.98 --> 2918.52]  he says to God
[2918.52 --> 2919.18]  in prayer
[2919.18 --> 2920.88]  comes in the form
[2920.88 --> 2922.04]  of questions.
[2922.92 --> 2924.06]  When God feels
[2924.06 --> 2924.56]  absent,
[2924.80 --> 2925.94]  when we're downcast
[2925.94 --> 2926.64]  in our souls,
[2927.02 --> 2927.86]  it usually
[2927.86 --> 2929.70]  brings with it
[2929.70 --> 2930.84]  a set of questions,
[2930.94 --> 2931.36]  doesn't it?
[2932.44 --> 2933.56]  Why questions?
[2934.80 --> 2936.24]  When questions?
[2937.24 --> 2938.80]  How long?
[2939.46 --> 2940.32]  Kinds of questions.
[2940.44 --> 2940.54]  Right?
[2940.60 --> 2941.66]  So many questions.
[2942.70 --> 2943.60]  And what we learn
[2943.60 --> 2944.38]  from Psalm 42
[2944.38 --> 2946.02]  is that God
[2946.02 --> 2946.80]  welcomes them all.
[2947.62 --> 2948.06]  He welcomes
[2948.06 --> 2949.02]  every question
[2949.02 --> 2950.16]  that we can bring
[2950.16 --> 2950.62]  to him.
[2951.54 --> 2952.24]  And the psalmist
[2952.24 --> 2953.16]  asks these questions
[2953.16 --> 2953.78]  to God,
[2953.86 --> 2954.56]  not because he
[2954.56 --> 2955.32]  doubts God,
[2955.84 --> 2956.72]  but because he
[2956.72 --> 2957.74]  believes so deeply
[2957.74 --> 2958.86]  in God.
[2959.86 --> 2960.98]  And that makes sense,
[2961.04 --> 2961.20]  right?
[2961.26 --> 2961.70]  Because,
[2961.82 --> 2961.96]  you know,
[2962.00 --> 2962.84]  we don't question
[2962.84 --> 2963.54]  a God that you
[2963.54 --> 2964.20]  don't believe in.
[2964.80 --> 2965.22]  What would be
[2965.22 --> 2966.06]  the point of that?
[2966.24 --> 2968.32]  And that's why
[2968.32 --> 2969.22]  God is not asking
[2969.22 --> 2970.14]  us to bottle up
[2970.14 --> 2970.76]  our questions.
[2971.16 --> 2972.44]  God is inviting us
[2972.44 --> 2973.80]  to ask our questions.
[2974.50 --> 2975.50]  And then even more,
[2976.00 --> 2977.68]  he's giving us
[2977.68 --> 2978.22]  the questions.
[2978.36 --> 2979.02]  This is the word
[2979.02 --> 2979.50]  of God.
[2980.08 --> 2980.84]  He's giving us
[2980.84 --> 2981.38]  the questions
[2981.38 --> 2982.06]  like the ones
[2982.06 --> 2982.64]  we find here.
[2982.80 --> 2984.00]  Where or when
[2984.00 --> 2984.78]  can I go and meet
[2984.78 --> 2985.30]  with God?
[2985.58 --> 2985.94]  God,
[2986.04 --> 2986.70]  why have you
[2986.70 --> 2987.44]  forgotten me?
[2987.62 --> 2988.50]  He's given us
[2988.50 --> 2988.92]  the language
[2988.92 --> 2990.02]  to say that to him.
[2992.46 --> 2993.42]  Maybe some of you
[2993.42 --> 2994.46]  will know the name
[2994.46 --> 2995.92]  Eli Wiesel.
[2996.92 --> 2998.36]  He survived
[2998.36 --> 2998.90]  the Holocaust
[2998.90 --> 3000.30]  and became a writer
[3000.30 --> 3001.24]  and a peace advocate.
[3001.86 --> 3002.70]  The famous book
[3002.70 --> 3003.06]  he wrote
[3003.06 --> 3003.44]  is called
[3003.44 --> 3003.80]  Night.
[3005.26 --> 3006.16]  And once,
[3006.26 --> 3007.46]  while giving a talk,
[3007.60 --> 3008.62]  he told this story.
[3009.70 --> 3011.08]  The story is
[3011.08 --> 3012.28]  that in one
[3012.28 --> 3012.98]  of the Nazi
[3012.98 --> 3014.20]  concentration camps,
[3014.20 --> 3015.38]  a number of
[3015.38 --> 3016.62]  the imprisoned Jews
[3016.62 --> 3017.68]  decided to put
[3017.68 --> 3018.68]  God on trial
[3018.68 --> 3020.38]  for covenant
[3020.38 --> 3021.10]  unfaithfulness.
[3021.10 --> 3022.98]  You know,
[3023.04 --> 3023.52]  in the midst
[3023.52 --> 3024.44]  of their suffering,
[3024.62 --> 3025.44]  during those dark
[3025.44 --> 3025.88]  days,
[3026.20 --> 3027.04]  they had some
[3027.04 --> 3027.98]  questions for God.
[3029.18 --> 3029.94]  And so they asked
[3029.94 --> 3030.66]  a rabbi,
[3030.80 --> 3031.62]  who was also
[3031.62 --> 3032.48]  in the camp,
[3032.80 --> 3033.72]  to preside
[3033.72 --> 3034.62]  as judge.
[3035.76 --> 3036.36]  Testimony
[3036.36 --> 3037.22]  was given,
[3037.68 --> 3038.82]  cross-examinations
[3038.82 --> 3039.22]  happened,
[3039.22 --> 3040.60]  and in the end,
[3040.76 --> 3041.32]  the verdict
[3041.32 --> 3041.98]  came.
[3042.40 --> 3043.12]  It came in
[3043.12 --> 3043.72]  on the charge
[3043.72 --> 3044.80]  of God's
[3044.80 --> 3045.30]  covenant
[3045.30 --> 3045.96]  unfaithfulness.
[3045.96 --> 3046.90]  the verdict
[3046.90 --> 3048.28]  was guilty
[3048.28 --> 3049.50]  as charged.
[3050.66 --> 3051.92]  They were about
[3051.92 --> 3052.72]  to announce
[3052.72 --> 3053.28]  the verdict,
[3054.00 --> 3054.70]  but they had
[3054.70 --> 3055.22]  to stop.
[3055.32 --> 3055.68]  They had to
[3055.68 --> 3056.50]  break it off
[3056.50 --> 3057.52]  before they got
[3057.52 --> 3058.16]  to that part
[3058.16 --> 3059.30]  because,
[3059.42 --> 3059.80]  you see,
[3060.52 --> 3061.42]  it was time
[3061.42 --> 3062.20]  for evening
[3062.20 --> 3062.70]  prayers.
[3066.46 --> 3067.46]  Then Eli
[3067.46 --> 3067.98]  said,
[3068.96 --> 3069.50]  a Jew
[3069.50 --> 3070.78]  can be happy
[3070.78 --> 3071.30]  with God
[3071.30 --> 3072.96]  or angry
[3072.96 --> 3073.66]  with God,
[3074.28 --> 3075.00]  but a Jew
[3075.00 --> 3075.82]  can never be
[3075.82 --> 3076.96]  without God.
[3078.36 --> 3079.20]  So as much
[3079.20 --> 3079.80]  as they had
[3079.80 --> 3080.42]  these questions
[3080.42 --> 3080.96]  for God,
[3081.30 --> 3082.18]  angry at Him,
[3082.36 --> 3083.04]  when it came
[3083.04 --> 3084.26]  time to pray,
[3085.82 --> 3086.04]  well,
[3086.06 --> 3086.44]  we got to
[3086.44 --> 3086.90]  stop what we're
[3086.90 --> 3087.06]  doing.
[3087.16 --> 3087.72]  We got to pray
[3087.72 --> 3088.66]  because they
[3088.66 --> 3089.78]  still desired God.
[3089.86 --> 3090.42]  They knew God.
[3090.48 --> 3090.86]  They believed
[3090.86 --> 3091.34]  in God.
[3092.26 --> 3093.00]  They were just
[3093.00 --> 3093.70]  angry with Him.
[3093.98 --> 3094.62]  They had questions
[3094.62 --> 3095.02]  for Him.
[3095.12 --> 3095.88]  Of course.
[3096.46 --> 3096.90]  But God
[3096.90 --> 3097.58]  welcomes that.
[3097.78 --> 3098.74]  That's the invitation
[3098.74 --> 3099.52]  of Psalm 42.
[3100.46 --> 3101.06]  That's one of the
[3101.06 --> 3101.92]  big points of the
[3101.92 --> 3102.18]  Psalm,
[3102.58 --> 3103.34]  that we can pour
[3103.34 --> 3103.96]  out our souls
[3103.96 --> 3104.38]  to God.
[3104.48 --> 3105.22]  God invites us
[3105.22 --> 3105.86]  to do that.
[3106.28 --> 3107.14]  He delights
[3107.14 --> 3108.06]  in us
[3108.06 --> 3108.74]  as we do
[3108.74 --> 3109.16]  that
[3109.16 --> 3110.74]  because we're
[3110.74 --> 3111.66]  praying to Him
[3111.66 --> 3112.26]  and we're
[3112.26 --> 3112.90]  seeking Him.
[3114.18 --> 3114.70]  So that's the
[3114.70 --> 3115.22]  first cure
[3115.22 --> 3116.04]  for downcast
[3116.04 --> 3116.32]  souls.
[3116.48 --> 3117.42]  Don't stop
[3117.42 --> 3118.28]  praying to God.
[3119.06 --> 3119.70]  When you don't
[3119.70 --> 3120.40]  feel like praying,
[3120.48 --> 3120.86]  that's when you
[3120.86 --> 3121.42]  need to pray.
[3121.60 --> 3121.98]  That's when you
[3121.98 --> 3122.48]  need to pour
[3122.48 --> 3123.08]  out your soul
[3123.08 --> 3123.52]  to God.
[3124.20 --> 3124.82]  And He invites
[3124.82 --> 3125.46]  us to do so.
[3125.88 --> 3126.56]  Now secondly,
[3127.34 --> 3127.80]  the psalmist,
[3127.96 --> 3129.56]  he not only
[3129.56 --> 3130.36]  talks to God,
[3130.76 --> 3131.76]  but he talks
[3131.76 --> 3132.68]  to himself.
[3132.68 --> 3134.96]  And friends,
[3135.06 --> 3135.76]  this is something
[3135.76 --> 3136.54]  that Christians,
[3136.78 --> 3137.46]  we need to learn
[3137.46 --> 3138.20]  how to do this.
[3138.54 --> 3139.38]  We need to learn
[3139.38 --> 3140.20]  how to talk
[3140.20 --> 3140.78]  to ourselves.
[3141.18 --> 3141.86]  We need to learn
[3141.86 --> 3142.46]  how to take
[3142.46 --> 3143.38]  ourselves aside
[3143.38 --> 3144.84]  and have a good
[3144.84 --> 3146.18]  talk with
[3146.18 --> 3146.64]  ourselves.
[3148.10 --> 3148.58]  Now,
[3148.66 --> 3149.26]  maybe you don't
[3149.26 --> 3149.94]  realize it,
[3150.52 --> 3151.26]  but you already
[3151.26 --> 3151.74]  do this,
[3151.78 --> 3151.96]  right?
[3152.82 --> 3153.56]  You talk to
[3153.56 --> 3153.96]  yourself.
[3154.96 --> 3155.82]  Do you realize
[3155.82 --> 3156.74]  that you talk
[3156.74 --> 3157.54]  to you
[3157.54 --> 3158.42]  more than
[3158.42 --> 3159.06]  anybody else
[3159.06 --> 3159.36]  does?
[3159.36 --> 3161.38]  Maybe that's
[3161.38 --> 3162.06]  kind of a
[3162.06 --> 3162.40]  terrifying
[3162.40 --> 3163.18]  realization.
[3164.14 --> 3164.70]  But you
[3164.70 --> 3165.82]  talk to you
[3165.82 --> 3166.78]  more than
[3166.78 --> 3167.72]  anybody else
[3167.72 --> 3168.34]  does.
[3169.46 --> 3170.10]  So the question
[3170.10 --> 3170.54]  is,
[3170.74 --> 3172.20]  what are you
[3172.20 --> 3172.54]  saying to
[3172.54 --> 3172.96]  yourself?
[3175.14 --> 3175.48]  You know,
[3175.54 --> 3176.22]  ourselves,
[3176.38 --> 3176.92]  we tell ourselves
[3176.92 --> 3177.58]  all kinds of
[3177.58 --> 3179.22]  bad things,
[3179.34 --> 3180.04]  stupid things.
[3180.44 --> 3180.76]  Are you
[3180.76 --> 3181.36]  listening to
[3181.36 --> 3181.94]  yourself?
[3183.20 --> 3183.98]  Even if it's
[3183.98 --> 3184.32]  a mocking
[3184.32 --> 3184.80]  voice,
[3184.84 --> 3185.12]  or are you
[3185.12 --> 3185.46]  listening to
[3185.46 --> 3185.70]  the voice
[3185.70 --> 3186.12]  of God?
[3186.42 --> 3186.60]  But we
[3186.60 --> 3187.06]  tell ourselves,
[3187.14 --> 3187.30]  you know,
[3187.74 --> 3187.90]  we,
[3187.90 --> 3188.28]  we,
[3188.28 --> 3189.64]  so the
[3189.64 --> 3190.00]  question is,
[3190.06 --> 3190.34]  what kind
[3190.34 --> 3191.18]  of interpretive
[3191.18 --> 3192.64]  spin are
[3192.64 --> 3193.12]  you giving
[3193.12 --> 3193.52]  to your
[3193.52 --> 3193.94]  life?
[3194.94 --> 3195.58]  What kind
[3195.58 --> 3196.22]  of interpretive
[3196.22 --> 3197.44]  spin are
[3197.44 --> 3197.90]  you telling
[3197.90 --> 3198.52]  yourself about
[3198.52 --> 3199.00]  who God
[3199.00 --> 3199.34]  is,
[3199.36 --> 3200.02]  or who you
[3200.02 --> 3200.36]  are,
[3200.98 --> 3201.44]  or what's
[3201.44 --> 3201.96]  going on
[3201.96 --> 3202.20]  in your
[3202.20 --> 3202.54]  life?
[3203.58 --> 3203.96]  This is
[3203.96 --> 3204.54]  important to
[3204.54 --> 3205.02]  think about.
[3205.64 --> 3206.12]  So let's
[3206.12 --> 3206.88]  talk about
[3206.88 --> 3207.66]  healthy
[3207.66 --> 3208.76]  self-talk.
[3210.00 --> 3210.84]  And I'll
[3210.84 --> 3211.20]  share this
[3211.20 --> 3211.62]  quote with
[3211.62 --> 3212.12]  you that I
[3212.12 --> 3212.74]  found this
[3212.74 --> 3212.96]  week,
[3213.02 --> 3213.18]  that's
[3213.18 --> 3213.50]  great.
[3214.40 --> 3214.66]  John
[3214.66 --> 3215.00]  Stott,
[3215.20 --> 3215.86]  talking to
[3215.86 --> 3216.44]  yourself is
[3216.44 --> 3216.80]  not the
[3216.80 --> 3217.26]  first sign
[3217.26 --> 3217.72]  of madness.
[3218.28 --> 3219.42]  It is a
[3219.42 --> 3220.14]  sign of
[3220.14 --> 3221.64]  maturity if
[3221.64 --> 3221.92]  you are
[3221.92 --> 3222.64]  talking to
[3222.64 --> 3224.10]  yourself about
[3224.10 --> 3224.46]  God.
[3225.90 --> 3227.24]  And that is
[3227.24 --> 3228.00]  exactly what
[3228.00 --> 3228.44]  the psalmist
[3228.44 --> 3229.72]  does here in
[3229.72 --> 3230.36]  verse 5.
[3230.86 --> 3231.44]  Take a look
[3231.44 --> 3232.00]  with me here
[3232.00 --> 3232.64]  at verse 5.
[3234.06 --> 3235.74]  He turns to
[3235.74 --> 3236.34]  himself,
[3236.90 --> 3237.98]  to his soul,
[3238.48 --> 3239.38]  and he says,
[3240.10 --> 3240.56]  why,
[3241.06 --> 3241.68]  my soul,
[3241.96 --> 3242.14]  why,
[3242.26 --> 3242.64]  self,
[3243.20 --> 3243.72]  are you
[3243.72 --> 3244.40]  downcast?
[3245.02 --> 3245.80]  Why so
[3245.80 --> 3246.20]  disturbed
[3246.20 --> 3246.80]  within me?
[3247.48 --> 3248.10]  Put your
[3248.10 --> 3248.52]  hope in
[3248.52 --> 3248.86]  God,
[3249.22 --> 3249.50]  for I
[3249.50 --> 3249.88]  will yet
[3249.88 --> 3250.40]  praise him,
[3250.48 --> 3250.86]  my Savior,
[3251.00 --> 3251.20]  and my
[3251.20 --> 3251.54]  God.
[3251.94 --> 3252.34]  Friends,
[3252.42 --> 3252.78]  this is
[3252.78 --> 3253.24]  healthy
[3253.24 --> 3254.12]  self-talk.
[3254.96 --> 3255.40]  This is
[3255.40 --> 3255.78]  the way
[3255.78 --> 3256.30]  a Christian
[3256.30 --> 3256.92]  talks to
[3256.92 --> 3257.38]  themselves
[3257.38 --> 3258.34]  when they
[3258.34 --> 3259.18]  are downcast
[3259.18 --> 3259.70]  in spirit.
[3260.06 --> 3260.54]  Why,
[3260.74 --> 3261.52]  my soul,
[3261.64 --> 3262.14]  are you
[3262.14 --> 3262.86]  downcast?
[3263.86 --> 3264.50]  This is
[3264.50 --> 3264.92]  someone who
[3264.92 --> 3265.38]  is able,
[3265.52 --> 3265.94]  in a sense,
[3266.00 --> 3266.88]  to step to
[3266.88 --> 3267.56]  the side of
[3267.56 --> 3268.68]  themselves and
[3268.68 --> 3269.26]  to examine
[3269.26 --> 3269.82]  their own
[3269.82 --> 3270.30]  feelings,
[3270.44 --> 3270.92]  to examine
[3270.92 --> 3271.32]  their own
[3271.32 --> 3271.80]  emotions.
[3271.80 --> 3273.46]  This is
[3273.46 --> 3273.86]  someone who
[3273.86 --> 3274.76]  is self-aware
[3274.76 --> 3275.98]  enough to
[3275.98 --> 3276.54]  look within
[3276.54 --> 3277.60]  and say,
[3277.92 --> 3279.46]  I'm feeling
[3279.46 --> 3279.90]  something,
[3280.38 --> 3280.96]  I'm feeling
[3280.96 --> 3281.42]  sad,
[3281.50 --> 3281.82]  I'm feeling
[3281.82 --> 3282.46]  downcast,
[3282.52 --> 3282.82]  I'm feeling
[3282.82 --> 3284.18]  spiritually dry,
[3284.46 --> 3284.70]  you know,
[3285.00 --> 3286.72]  what's going
[3286.72 --> 3287.26]  on?
[3288.12 --> 3289.06]  Why am I
[3289.06 --> 3289.64]  feeling that
[3289.64 --> 3289.96]  way?
[3291.16 --> 3291.54]  So he
[3291.54 --> 3291.94]  asks that
[3291.94 --> 3292.34]  question,
[3292.44 --> 3292.66]  what's
[3292.66 --> 3293.00]  happening
[3293.00 --> 3293.52]  inside of
[3293.52 --> 3293.74]  me?
[3294.16 --> 3294.72]  But then
[3294.72 --> 3295.80]  he goes
[3295.80 --> 3296.46]  to self-
[3296.46 --> 3297.04]  encouragement,
[3297.58 --> 3299.02]  self-exhortation.
[3299.78 --> 3300.28]  What does
[3300.28 --> 3300.60]  he tell
[3300.60 --> 3300.98]  himself?
[3301.80 --> 3302.62]  Put your
[3302.62 --> 3303.16]  hope in
[3303.16 --> 3303.56]  God,
[3303.78 --> 3304.22]  self.
[3305.78 --> 3306.08]  You know,
[3306.14 --> 3306.68]  sometimes we
[3306.68 --> 3306.90]  need to
[3306.90 --> 3307.26]  be talking
[3307.26 --> 3307.88]  with ourselves.
[3308.80 --> 3309.54]  Put your
[3309.54 --> 3309.86]  hope in
[3309.86 --> 3310.18]  God.
[3311.46 --> 3312.18]  This is
[3312.18 --> 3313.00]  someone who
[3313.00 --> 3313.50]  has learned
[3313.50 --> 3313.98]  how to
[3313.98 --> 3314.90]  preach to
[3314.90 --> 3315.34]  themselves.
[3316.54 --> 3316.66]  Right?
[3316.72 --> 3316.96]  This is
[3316.96 --> 3317.34]  someone who
[3317.34 --> 3317.76]  has learned
[3317.76 --> 3318.16]  how to
[3318.16 --> 3319.22]  listen to
[3319.22 --> 3319.66]  God's
[3319.66 --> 3320.10]  word and
[3320.10 --> 3320.64]  then to
[3320.64 --> 3321.56]  speak God's
[3321.56 --> 3322.66]  word back
[3322.66 --> 3323.48]  to
[3323.48 --> 3324.14]  themselves.
[3325.48 --> 3326.24]  And look
[3326.24 --> 3326.58]  at some
[3326.58 --> 3326.82]  of the
[3326.82 --> 3327.38]  things that
[3327.38 --> 3328.10]  he reminds
[3328.10 --> 3328.94]  himself about
[3328.94 --> 3329.62]  that he
[3329.62 --> 3330.14]  knows is
[3330.14 --> 3330.44]  true.
[3330.44 --> 3331.96]  what he
[3331.96 --> 3332.46]  knows about
[3332.46 --> 3332.74]  God.
[3332.84 --> 3333.08]  So look
[3333.08 --> 3333.38]  at verse
[3333.38 --> 3333.68]  seven.
[3335.04 --> 3335.78]  He says,
[3336.32 --> 3337.18]  deep calls
[3337.18 --> 3337.76]  to deep.
[3337.90 --> 3338.04]  Now,
[3338.12 --> 3338.38]  this is
[3338.38 --> 3339.16]  poetic and
[3339.16 --> 3339.86]  the commentaries
[3339.86 --> 3340.16]  I read,
[3340.24 --> 3340.58]  they weren't
[3340.58 --> 3341.08]  quite sure
[3341.08 --> 3341.34]  what it
[3341.34 --> 3341.54]  means,
[3341.60 --> 3341.90]  but maybe
[3341.90 --> 3342.24]  it's like
[3342.24 --> 3342.96]  the deeps
[3342.96 --> 3343.18]  of the
[3343.18 --> 3343.44]  water
[3343.44 --> 3344.64]  above and
[3344.64 --> 3345.10]  the deeps
[3345.10 --> 3345.46]  of the
[3345.46 --> 3345.80]  water
[3345.80 --> 3346.42]  beneath.
[3346.64 --> 3346.98]  They're
[3346.98 --> 3347.26]  kind of
[3347.26 --> 3347.54]  like,
[3347.88 --> 3348.14]  you know,
[3348.18 --> 3348.78]  just really
[3348.78 --> 3349.08]  wet.
[3349.26 --> 3349.36]  You know,
[3349.40 --> 3349.76]  just like
[3349.76 --> 3350.40]  water coming
[3350.40 --> 3350.64]  down,
[3350.72 --> 3351.12]  water coming
[3351.12 --> 3351.44]  up.
[3352.26 --> 3352.64]  Then,
[3353.18 --> 3353.70]  deep calls
[3353.70 --> 3354.18]  to deep
[3354.18 --> 3354.44]  and the
[3354.44 --> 3354.96]  roar of your
[3354.96 --> 3355.78]  waterfalls.
[3355.78 --> 3356.44]  All your
[3356.44 --> 3357.08]  waves and
[3357.08 --> 3357.62]  breakers have
[3357.62 --> 3358.24]  swept over
[3358.24 --> 3358.56]  me.
[3358.82 --> 3359.02]  Like,
[3359.08 --> 3359.46]  just think of
[3359.46 --> 3360.02]  car wash.
[3360.18 --> 3360.32]  Like,
[3360.48 --> 3360.80]  there's just
[3360.80 --> 3361.50]  water everywhere.
[3363.90 --> 3365.26]  He feels like
[3365.26 --> 3365.66]  he's swimming
[3365.66 --> 3366.32]  in an ocean.
[3367.50 --> 3368.10]  When I was
[3368.10 --> 3368.62]  growing up,
[3368.68 --> 3368.86]  we would
[3368.86 --> 3369.64]  often go to
[3369.64 --> 3370.24]  the coast
[3370.24 --> 3370.78]  in Maine,
[3371.02 --> 3371.56]  and I would
[3371.56 --> 3372.26]  spend hours
[3372.26 --> 3372.74]  swimming in
[3372.74 --> 3373.18]  the ocean
[3373.18 --> 3374.38]  every summer,
[3374.66 --> 3375.30]  and sometimes
[3375.30 --> 3375.92]  the waves,
[3376.40 --> 3376.72]  there's a
[3376.72 --> 3377.34]  beach break,
[3377.42 --> 3377.86]  sometimes the
[3377.86 --> 3378.42]  waves would
[3378.42 --> 3378.88]  get really
[3378.88 --> 3379.24]  big,
[3379.64 --> 3380.56]  and you get
[3380.56 --> 3381.44]  knocked over,
[3382.04 --> 3382.44]  and then you're
[3382.44 --> 3383.10]  kind of tumbling
[3383.10 --> 3383.70]  in the surf,
[3383.78 --> 3384.58]  head over heels,
[3384.58 --> 3386.16]  it's disorienting,
[3386.94 --> 3387.72]  it's hard to
[3387.72 --> 3388.38]  get a breath,
[3388.60 --> 3388.82]  you know,
[3388.88 --> 3389.28]  it's kind of
[3389.28 --> 3389.76]  these powerful
[3389.76 --> 3390.18]  waves are
[3390.18 --> 3390.64]  pushing you
[3390.64 --> 3391.08]  down the
[3391.08 --> 3391.66]  coast,
[3391.94 --> 3392.72]  and then you
[3392.72 --> 3393.36]  try to stand
[3393.36 --> 3393.62]  up,
[3393.64 --> 3393.98]  and as soon
[3393.98 --> 3394.50]  as you do,
[3394.62 --> 3395.18]  another wave,
[3395.36 --> 3395.70]  wham,
[3395.82 --> 3396.02]  you know,
[3396.26 --> 3397.20]  it happens
[3397.20 --> 3397.56]  again.
[3398.22 --> 3398.70]  And this is
[3398.70 --> 3399.00]  what he's
[3399.00 --> 3399.54]  experiencing,
[3399.64 --> 3399.86]  he's just
[3399.86 --> 3400.56]  getting hit
[3400.56 --> 3401.64]  over and
[3401.64 --> 3402.32]  over again,
[3403.18 --> 3403.68]  and sometimes
[3403.68 --> 3404.30]  life feels
[3404.30 --> 3404.72]  that way.
[3405.64 --> 3406.34]  But notice
[3406.34 --> 3407.28]  how he talks
[3407.28 --> 3407.84]  to himself
[3407.84 --> 3408.42]  about the
[3408.42 --> 3408.80]  waves.
[3409.76 --> 3410.38]  He says
[3410.38 --> 3410.68]  what?
[3411.80 --> 3412.40]  They're your
[3412.40 --> 3412.92]  waves.
[3412.92 --> 3414.78]  They're your
[3414.78 --> 3416.08]  breakers.
[3417.34 --> 3418.24]  He's reminding
[3418.24 --> 3419.20]  himself of the
[3419.20 --> 3419.96]  things he knows
[3419.96 --> 3420.44]  for sure,
[3420.54 --> 3421.90]  that God is
[3421.90 --> 3423.56]  sovereign over
[3423.56 --> 3424.40]  everything.
[3425.24 --> 3425.90]  He might not
[3425.90 --> 3426.60]  know why things
[3426.60 --> 3427.10]  are happening,
[3427.36 --> 3428.00]  but he knows
[3428.00 --> 3429.14]  for sure that
[3429.14 --> 3430.10]  God's in charge.
[3430.78 --> 3431.62]  God's not absent,
[3431.78 --> 3432.92]  he is in charge,
[3433.14 --> 3433.78]  and he preaches
[3433.78 --> 3434.66]  that to himself.
[3435.76 --> 3436.62]  These are waves
[3436.62 --> 3437.28]  that are hitting me,
[3437.38 --> 3437.66]  but God,
[3437.72 --> 3438.40]  they're your waves.
[3438.40 --> 3440.96]  And while it's
[3440.96 --> 3441.66]  true that God
[3441.66 --> 3442.32]  has allowed
[3442.32 --> 3443.96]  wave after wave
[3443.96 --> 3444.58]  of suffering
[3444.58 --> 3445.60]  to wash over
[3445.60 --> 3445.90]  him,
[3446.00 --> 3446.58]  that's not the
[3446.58 --> 3447.04]  whole picture.
[3447.80 --> 3448.30]  So look at
[3448.30 --> 3448.82]  verse 8.
[3450.34 --> 3451.20]  By day the
[3451.20 --> 3452.22]  Lord directs
[3452.22 --> 3452.94]  his love.
[3453.44 --> 3454.44]  At night his
[3454.44 --> 3456.10]  song is with
[3456.10 --> 3456.88]  me, a prayer
[3456.88 --> 3457.50]  to the God
[3457.50 --> 3458.28]  of my life.
[3458.90 --> 3459.66]  Remember earlier,
[3459.74 --> 3460.12]  I think it was
[3460.12 --> 3460.76]  verse 3, he
[3460.76 --> 3461.90]  says, day and
[3461.90 --> 3462.82]  night my tears
[3462.82 --> 3463.24]  have been my
[3463.24 --> 3463.56]  food.
[3464.16 --> 3464.70]  Now in verse
[3464.70 --> 3466.76]  8, day the
[3466.76 --> 3467.34]  Lord directs
[3467.34 --> 3467.68]  his love.
[3467.68 --> 3468.98]  At night his
[3468.98 --> 3469.60]  song is with
[3469.60 --> 3469.86]  me.
[3470.70 --> 3470.92]  Right?
[3471.00 --> 3471.32]  So it's not
[3471.32 --> 3473.42]  just tears, but
[3473.42 --> 3473.96]  it's the love
[3473.96 --> 3474.44]  of God.
[3475.00 --> 3475.64]  It's a song
[3475.64 --> 3476.50]  in his heart.
[3478.10 --> 3479.56]  And so there,
[3479.80 --> 3480.20]  you know, even
[3480.20 --> 3481.00]  just within the
[3481.00 --> 3481.96]  chaos, beneath
[3481.96 --> 3484.26]  the waves, is
[3484.26 --> 3485.10]  found the
[3485.10 --> 3485.76]  steadfast love
[3485.76 --> 3486.18]  of God.
[3486.86 --> 3487.60]  Getting us
[3487.60 --> 3488.02]  through the
[3488.02 --> 3489.52]  days, giving
[3489.52 --> 3490.32]  us a song in
[3490.32 --> 3491.00]  the night, that
[3491.00 --> 3491.68]  is a prayer to
[3491.68 --> 3491.94]  God.
[3492.94 --> 3493.98]  And it's there
[3493.98 --> 3494.98]  in the darkness
[3494.98 --> 3495.86]  of the night
[3495.86 --> 3496.68]  that we discover
[3496.68 --> 3497.52]  that the
[3497.52 --> 3498.10]  bedrock
[3498.10 --> 3498.96]  foundation of
[3498.96 --> 3499.48]  our faith
[3499.48 --> 3500.40]  is God
[3500.40 --> 3500.76]  himself.
[3501.92 --> 3502.44]  And he
[3502.44 --> 3503.38]  allows suffering
[3503.38 --> 3504.10]  to roll into
[3504.10 --> 3504.72]  our experience
[3504.72 --> 3505.78]  like waves, but
[3505.78 --> 3506.52]  his steadfast
[3506.52 --> 3507.46]  love doesn't
[3507.46 --> 3508.42]  come in waves.
[3508.70 --> 3509.50]  His steadfast
[3509.50 --> 3510.12]  love is a
[3510.12 --> 3510.56]  bedrock.
[3511.32 --> 3512.24]  He directs
[3512.24 --> 3512.62]  his love
[3512.62 --> 3513.30]  toward us.
[3514.96 --> 3515.28]  And friends,
[3515.34 --> 3516.10]  of course, the
[3516.10 --> 3517.30]  place where we
[3517.30 --> 3518.10]  see the love of
[3518.10 --> 3519.10]  God most clearly
[3519.10 --> 3520.46]  for us is in
[3520.46 --> 3521.20]  Jesus Christ.
[3522.20 --> 3523.04]  It's in Jesus
[3523.04 --> 3523.34]  Christ.
[3523.34 --> 3523.74]  So I want
[3523.74 --> 3524.22]  to share
[3524.22 --> 3525.18]  with you
[3525.18 --> 3525.94]  this painting.
[3529.30 --> 3530.52]  So our
[3530.52 --> 3530.92]  Russian
[3530.92 --> 3531.26]  Orthodox
[3531.26 --> 3532.04]  friends have
[3532.04 --> 3532.46]  good art,
[3532.96 --> 3534.00]  and this is
[3534.00 --> 3534.34]  a beautiful
[3534.34 --> 3534.70]  one.
[3535.32 --> 3536.04]  And it's
[3536.04 --> 3536.36]  from the
[3536.36 --> 3536.70]  scene that
[3536.70 --> 3537.02]  we read
[3537.02 --> 3537.62]  earlier in
[3537.62 --> 3538.08]  John chapter
[3538.08 --> 3538.42]  four.
[3538.76 --> 3539.02]  There you
[3539.02 --> 3539.36]  have Jesus
[3539.36 --> 3540.12]  talking with
[3540.12 --> 3540.82]  the Samaritan
[3540.82 --> 3541.14]  woman.
[3542.26 --> 3542.86]  Jesus says
[3542.86 --> 3543.82]  this, again,
[3543.96 --> 3544.90]  to the woman,
[3546.24 --> 3547.14]  everyone who
[3547.14 --> 3547.92]  drinks this
[3547.92 --> 3549.14]  water will
[3549.14 --> 3549.62]  be thirsty
[3549.62 --> 3550.06]  again.
[3550.06 --> 3551.72]  But whoever
[3551.72 --> 3552.30]  drinks of
[3552.30 --> 3552.80]  the water
[3552.80 --> 3553.40]  that I
[3553.40 --> 3553.78]  give him
[3553.78 --> 3554.16]  will never
[3554.16 --> 3554.66]  be thirsty
[3554.66 --> 3555.06]  again.
[3555.70 --> 3556.14]  And the
[3556.14 --> 3556.60]  water that
[3556.60 --> 3557.60]  I give him
[3557.60 --> 3558.30]  will become
[3558.30 --> 3559.34]  in him a
[3559.34 --> 3559.96]  spring of
[3559.96 --> 3560.36]  water,
[3561.00 --> 3561.62]  welling up
[3561.62 --> 3562.64]  to eternal
[3562.64 --> 3563.08]  life.
[3564.52 --> 3565.26]  Now, if you
[3565.26 --> 3566.00]  look closely at
[3566.00 --> 3566.60]  this painting,
[3566.74 --> 3567.22]  perhaps you
[3567.22 --> 3567.74]  will notice
[3567.74 --> 3568.14]  something.
[3568.26 --> 3568.60]  It's kind
[3568.60 --> 3568.84]  of an
[3568.84 --> 3569.26]  artistic
[3569.26 --> 3570.04]  interpretation.
[3571.10 --> 3571.46]  Do you
[3571.46 --> 3571.86]  see it?
[3573.30 --> 3573.98]  It's the
[3573.98 --> 3574.58]  shape of the
[3574.58 --> 3574.80]  well.
[3575.94 --> 3576.18]  Right?
[3576.32 --> 3577.12]  It's not a
[3577.12 --> 3577.48]  circle.
[3577.88 --> 3578.34]  What is it?
[3579.08 --> 3579.40]  It's a
[3579.40 --> 3579.78]  cross.
[3580.06 --> 3583.40]  Friends, when
[3583.40 --> 3584.64]  our souls are
[3584.64 --> 3586.20]  downcast, when
[3586.20 --> 3587.06]  we feel the
[3587.06 --> 3587.72]  absence of
[3587.72 --> 3588.90]  God, we
[3588.90 --> 3589.52]  remember that
[3589.52 --> 3589.86]  on the
[3589.86 --> 3591.38]  cross, Jesus
[3591.38 --> 3592.90]  was truly
[3592.90 --> 3593.42]  abandoned.
[3594.26 --> 3594.50]  Right?
[3594.58 --> 3595.38]  He took our
[3595.38 --> 3596.20]  questions, where
[3596.20 --> 3597.22]  is your God?
[3597.34 --> 3598.38]  And he made
[3598.38 --> 3599.22]  them his own.
[3599.94 --> 3600.68]  My God, my
[3600.68 --> 3601.96]  God, why
[3601.96 --> 3602.58]  have you
[3602.58 --> 3603.32]  forsaken me?
[3605.38 --> 3606.24]  He didn't
[3606.24 --> 3607.44]  just die for
[3607.44 --> 3607.92]  our sins.
[3608.04 --> 3609.88]  He took the
[3609.88 --> 3611.32]  whys of our
[3611.32 --> 3611.90]  lives upon
[3611.90 --> 3612.38]  himself.
[3613.52 --> 3614.10]  And on the
[3614.10 --> 3614.70]  cross, Jesus
[3614.70 --> 3616.04]  was cast far
[3616.04 --> 3616.66]  away from the
[3616.66 --> 3617.14]  presence of
[3617.14 --> 3618.32]  God, so that
[3618.32 --> 3619.12]  through faith in
[3619.12 --> 3620.50]  him, we could
[3620.50 --> 3622.24]  experience the
[3622.24 --> 3622.90]  nearness of
[3622.90 --> 3623.20]  God.
[3623.80 --> 3624.26]  That we could
[3624.26 --> 3625.22]  be made sons
[3625.22 --> 3625.90]  and daughters
[3625.90 --> 3627.02]  of our heavenly
[3627.02 --> 3627.46]  father.
[3627.46 --> 3629.46]  God's
[3629.46 --> 3630.46]  love.
[3630.46 --> 3631.18]  And when he
[3631.18 --> 3631.90]  cried from the
[3631.90 --> 3632.64]  cross, I
[3632.64 --> 3632.86]  thirst, that
[3632.86 --> 3634.26]  was the
[3634.26 --> 3635.96]  fulfillment of
[3635.96 --> 3637.08]  Psalm 42, the
[3637.08 --> 3637.76]  fulfillment of
[3637.76 --> 3638.44]  this deer
[3638.44 --> 3639.92]  panting for
[3639.92 --> 3641.02]  streams of
[3641.02 --> 3641.40]  water.
[3642.74 --> 3643.62]  Thirsting for
[3643.62 --> 3644.84]  God, but
[3644.84 --> 3645.32]  having this
[3645.32 --> 3646.70]  unquenched thirst.
[3648.08 --> 3648.54]  And the
[3648.54 --> 3649.38]  artist here is
[3649.38 --> 3650.22]  pointing to the
[3650.22 --> 3650.98]  reality that
[3650.98 --> 3652.26]  Jesus became
[3652.26 --> 3653.52]  parched,
[3653.52 --> 3656.74]  desiring God,
[3656.80 --> 3657.44]  but God not
[3657.44 --> 3659.02]  satisfying him,
[3659.42 --> 3659.98]  separated from
[3659.98 --> 3660.86]  God, so that
[3660.86 --> 3661.92]  our thirst
[3661.92 --> 3662.62]  could be
[3662.62 --> 3663.04]  quenched.
[3663.70 --> 3664.40]  So that our
[3664.40 --> 3665.50]  longing of our
[3665.50 --> 3667.08]  souls could,
[3668.24 --> 3668.76]  because there's
[3668.76 --> 3669.36]  nothing else in
[3669.36 --> 3670.24]  this world that it
[3670.24 --> 3671.18]  will satisfy, so
[3671.18 --> 3672.14]  that it could be
[3672.14 --> 3673.28]  satisfied in
[3673.28 --> 3673.80]  God.
[3674.56 --> 3675.56]  Friends, Jesus is
[3675.56 --> 3676.32]  the living water
[3676.32 --> 3677.42]  that our souls
[3677.42 --> 3677.98]  long for.
[3678.94 --> 3680.16]  So friends, the
[3680.16 --> 3680.82]  Lord loves you.
[3680.82 --> 3682.36]  He offers you
[3682.36 --> 3683.02]  the well of
[3683.02 --> 3684.90]  life, and if
[3684.90 --> 3685.60]  you hear his
[3685.60 --> 3687.72]  voice, ask him
[3687.72 --> 3689.76]  for a drink, and
[3689.76 --> 3690.58]  have your thirst
[3690.58 --> 3691.76]  quenched in him.
[3692.76 --> 3693.42]  Let's pray.
[3697.12 --> 3699.36]  Lord Jesus, as
[3699.36 --> 3702.32]  St. Augustine
[3702.32 --> 3703.30]  once said, you
[3703.30 --> 3704.08]  have made us for
[3704.08 --> 3705.90]  yourself, and
[3705.90 --> 3706.98]  our hearts are
[3706.98 --> 3708.64]  restless until
[3708.64 --> 3709.92]  they find our
[3709.92 --> 3710.92]  rest in you.
[3712.02 --> 3712.84]  And so help us,
[3713.04 --> 3713.80]  Lord, to drink
[3713.80 --> 3714.58]  from no other
[3714.58 --> 3716.32]  well, to listen
[3716.32 --> 3717.14]  to no other
[3717.14 --> 3718.86]  voice, and to
[3718.86 --> 3719.92]  find our true
[3719.92 --> 3721.06]  home in you.
[3721.46 --> 3722.24]  We pray in
[3722.24 --> 3722.80]  Jesus' name.
[3723.12 --> 3723.38]  Amen.
[3725.88 --> 3726.68]  So let's all
[3726.68 --> 3727.32]  stand, and we'll
[3727.32 --> 3728.28]  sing our song of
[3728.28 --> 3729.90]  response, and
[3729.90 --> 3730.40]  we'll sing
[3730.40 --> 3731.10]  Living Waters.
[3731.42 --> 3732.38]  So please stand,
[3732.50 --> 3733.00]  and as the
[3733.00 --> 3733.54]  worship team
[3733.54 --> 3733.92]  comes up.
[3733.92 --> 3734.22]  Amen.
[3734.22 --> 3734.28]  Amen.
[3734.28 --> 3734.32]  Amen.
[3734.32 --> 3734.38]  Amen.
[3734.38 --> 3734.82]  Amen.
[3734.82 --> 3734.88]  Amen.
[3734.88 --> 3735.38]  Amen.
[3735.38 --> 3735.88]  Amen.
[3735.88 --> 3736.32]  Amen.
[3736.32 --> 3736.38]  Amen.
[3736.38 --> 3736.88]  Amen.
[3736.88 --> 3737.38]  Amen.
[3737.38 --> 3737.88]  Amen.
[3737.88 --> 3738.38]  Amen.
[3738.38 --> 3738.88]  Amen.
[3738.88 --> 3739.88]  Amen.
[3739.92 --> 3747.14]  Amen.
[3747.14 --> 3772.16]  Are you thirsty? Are you empty? Come and drink these living waters.
[3772.16 --> 3784.12]  Tired and broken, peace unspoken, rest beside these living waters.
[3785.80 --> 3796.08]  Blessed is calling, God refreshing, at the cross of living waters.
[3796.08 --> 3808.08]  Lay your lap down, all the old God lies up in these living waters.
[3809.78 --> 3820.08]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love, bringing joy to the city of the cloud.
[3820.08 --> 3828.08]  There are hope, peace and pure, to not fear anymore.
[3829.76 --> 3834.08]  Praise the Lord of living waters.
[3834.08 --> 3847.08]  Spirit moving, nursing, washing, healing in these living waters.
[3849.08 --> 3855.08]  Lead your children to this shoreline.
[3855.08 --> 3860.08]  Life is in these living waters.
[3860.08 --> 3873.08]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love, bringing joy to the city of the cloud.
[3873.08 --> 3881.08]  There are hope, insecure, to not fear anymore.
[3881.08 --> 3887.08]  Praise the Lord of living waters.
[3887.08 --> 3900.08]  All you thirsty, are you empty? Come and drink these living waters.
[3900.08 --> 3901.08]  Love, strong, to not fear.

[3948.08 --> 3966.08]  Praise the Lord of living waters.
[3966.08 --> 3975.08]  So we worship the Lord by responding to His grace and in a way of giving of our tithes and offerings for the work of His kingdom.
[3975.08 --> 3979.08]  And so we have a designated cause most weeks.
[3979.08 --> 3982.08]  Sorry, it's not up there.
[3982.08 --> 3984.08]  Okay, I see it.
[3984.08 --> 3987.08]  The House of Omed.
[3987.08 --> 3992.08]  And this provides help for new immigrants, mainly from the Middle East.
[3992.08 --> 3994.08]  So that's our designated cause.
[3994.08 --> 3999.08]  And can may I ask the deacons to come and collect our morning offering.
[3999.08 --> 4000.08]  What do you do to do to do to see out pressMic out today?
[4000.08 --> 4002.58]  We're going to do to be albuming along.
[4006.08 --> 4008.08]  Let's pray to our free to...
[4008.08 --> 4020.08]  We need to pray to dark energy by welcoming us and rallied our美味 heaven.

[4132.80 --> 4137.18]  So let's join our hearts and in prayer to the Lord.
[4137.18 --> 4148.16]  Heavenly Father, whether we here today are just getting to know you or whether we have loved you for years,
[4149.04 --> 4154.68]  we all have times when we feel cut off from you and forsaken by you.
[4155.50 --> 4161.96]  Our souls feel parched because you are the living God for whom we thirst in the very depths of our being,
[4162.56 --> 4163.92]  in the very depths of our souls.
[4163.92 --> 4167.52]  Your presence is the only thing that will satisfy us.
[4168.50 --> 4171.56]  At times we are led astray by lesser things.
[4172.46 --> 4178.94]  We sometimes set our sights on temporary false pleasures and find ourselves far from satisfied.
[4179.72 --> 4185.28]  And when we find ourselves longing for something that we might not even be able to name,
[4185.28 --> 4195.10]  please help us take our souls in hand and direct them to see in you your gift of salvation and hope.
[4195.88 --> 4201.14]  We praise you for the truth that we will never truly be abandoned by you
[4201.14 --> 4205.36]  because Christ was willingly forsaken on our behalf.
[4205.36 --> 4208.64]  God, what you have done for us is amazing.
[4209.78 --> 4212.52]  Let your light and your truth lead us.
[4213.32 --> 4220.54]  Draw us into your presence again and again so that we can be satisfied again and again by the goodness of your love.
[4221.54 --> 4224.60]  We are in awe that you delight to come to us.
[4226.12 --> 4230.62]  Give us joy in your presence so that we can again praise you.
[4230.62 --> 4234.78]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4236.46 --> 4239.38]  O Lord, we lift up before you the many needs of our world.
[4240.10 --> 4249.98]  We pray for those who are suffering due to war, economic injustice, abuse, malnutrition, sickness, natural disasters.
[4249.98 --> 4257.06]  And Lord, as we hear about the ongoing conflict, civil war in Sudan,
[4258.46 --> 4262.58]  the many people, Lord, who need food and are malnourished,
[4263.30 --> 4269.02]  that don't have the resources they need to have a stable and functioning government or society,
[4269.72 --> 4271.54]  Lord, we ask for your mercy.
[4271.54 --> 4274.42]  Oh, sorry.
[4275.28 --> 4275.80]  Good.
[4277.24 --> 4280.44]  We ask also, Lord, that you would provide each of your children,
[4281.40 --> 4285.24]  provide for us, each one of us, our needs, Lord,
[4285.62 --> 4289.56]  that you would give us all wisdom and courage and compassion,
[4290.14 --> 4294.64]  Lord, to participate in the work of healing the world that you enable us to have.
[4295.32 --> 4298.14]  So, Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4298.14 --> 4301.28]  Lord, we pray also, Lord, for the growth of your church,
[4301.58 --> 4303.16]  that it would grow in numbers,
[4303.88 --> 4305.54]  that it would grow in maturity,
[4306.58 --> 4308.02]  and that it would grow in beauty
[4308.02 --> 4310.94]  as we become more and more like our Lord Jesus.
[4311.70 --> 4316.68]  We ask that you would shatter the strongholds of Satan in our hearts and in this world,
[4317.68 --> 4322.14]  and that you would lead us into the true freedom and joy of your kingdom.
[4322.14 --> 4328.82]  We pray particularly for those who face persecution around the world,
[4329.88 --> 4334.14]  and we pray that for your name's sake they're being persecuted.
[4334.56 --> 4339.40]  Lord, would you strengthen them and show your love to your enemies through them.
[4340.26 --> 4342.84]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4343.58 --> 4346.40]  Lord, we also lift up before you those in our congregation,
[4346.68 --> 4350.34]  those we know who are sick, who need your healing.
[4350.34 --> 4352.92]  Lord, we continue to pray for Kukuye.
[4353.06 --> 4356.26]  We thank you that his surgeries have been successful,
[4356.46 --> 4357.72]  that he is slowly recovering.
[4358.26 --> 4361.60]  Lord, would you continue to bring healing to his body.
[4362.14 --> 4363.50]  We also pray for Pat Bauman,
[4363.86 --> 4366.74]  who also continues to struggle with health problems.
[4367.60 --> 4370.92]  Lord, would you have your hand of healing upon her.
[4371.74 --> 4376.08]  Strengthen them and show them your love.
[4376.08 --> 4380.90]  And we also, Lord, pray for those who maybe we are thinking of,
[4381.38 --> 4383.26]  and we pray for them silently now.
[4383.26 --> 4398.82]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4399.46 --> 4404.74]  Lord, and we pray all of these things in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4404.80 --> 4406.60]  who loved us and gave himself for us.
[4407.10 --> 4408.24]  In his name we pray.
[4408.44 --> 4408.74]  Amen.
[4408.74 --> 4408.84]  Amen.
[4408.84 --> 4412.30]  So let's all stand,
[4413.30 --> 4417.82]  and we'll go out with God's good word upon us in the benediction.
[4418.06 --> 4420.58]  And then after, I invite you to join us for a time of fellowship
[4420.58 --> 4422.50]  right through the doors in the fellowship hall.
[4423.44 --> 4427.82]  So now stretch forth your hands and receive God's good word over you.
[4428.46 --> 4431.90]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father,
[4431.90 --> 4437.10]  the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you today and always.
[4437.50 --> 4437.90]  Amen.
