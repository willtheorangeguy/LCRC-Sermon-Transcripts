[313.00 --> 314.00]  Good morning.
[314.00 --> 317.00]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[317.00 --> 324.00]  My name is Jason Truel and it's my privilege to be leading us in the worship of the Lord
[324.00 --> 325.00]  this morning.
[325.00 --> 330.00]  If you are watching on live stream, I'm glad you're with us and we have sound.
[330.00 --> 331.00]  That's good.
[331.00 --> 332.00]  And, but you know what?
[332.00 --> 334.00]  There are some seats here.
[334.00 --> 338.00]  So you are welcome to come join us, especially in the front row.
[338.00 --> 340.00]  But you can also sit in the back.
[340.00 --> 341.00]  It's fine.
[341.00 --> 346.00]  If you are visiting today, we are especially glad that you are here with us.
[346.00 --> 355.00]  Today is the first week in the season of Advent and I'll talk more about that later.
[355.00 --> 364.00]  And just one announcement for today, which is the world renewed gift catalogs were distributed
[364.00 --> 368.00]  into people's mailboxes and they were in the banner.
[368.00 --> 373.00]  But what we're doing is encouraging people to look through the catalog.
[373.00 --> 382.00]  If you are led to choose an item to purchase that is then given to someone in the world who needs that thing.
[382.00 --> 387.00]  And then if you have done that already or if you intend to do it, there's a tree in the foyer.
[387.00 --> 392.00]  And there are some like ornaments, some cards that are these ornaments.
[392.00 --> 399.00]  And we want to encourage you to write, you don't have to write your name, but write down like what you purchased and hang it on the tree.
[399.00 --> 405.00]  So that way we can kind of decorate the tree and see all that we have given.
[405.00 --> 406.00]  Does that make sense?
[406.00 --> 409.00]  So let's consider doing that.
[409.00 --> 424.00]  And so the way we will do our call to worship in this season of Advent is actually through a tradition that we and many churches around the world have of lighting an Advent candle.
[424.00 --> 431.00]  And so I'm going to invite Jeanette and Jim to come up and lead us in the lighting of the Advent candle.
[431.00 --> 435.00]  The theme of this week is longing.
[435.00 --> 444.00]  Longing.
[444.00 --> 453.00]  Office of Withers...
[454.00 --> 457.00]  mount red.
[457.00 --> 458.00]  Byst.
[458.00 --> 459.00]  Open.
[459.00 --> 461.00]  My eyes have seen you.
[461.00 --> 463.00]  That you may have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles.
[463.00 --> 466.00]  Glory to your people, Israel.
[466.00 --> 467.96]  is come. We light these
[467.96 --> 469.90]  candles because Jesus, light of the
[469.90 --> 471.88]  world, has resealed himself to all
[471.88 --> 473.86]  nations and people and has
[473.86 --> 475.76]  made them a kingdom and priests
[475.76 --> 477.80]  to our God. Joy to the
[477.80 --> 479.50]  world. The Lord is come.
[496.00 --> 507.58]  Okay, would you pray with me?
[507.80 --> 509.02]  Join me in a prayer of adoration.
[513.24 --> 515.66]  Sing to the Lord, all the
[515.66 --> 517.66]  earth. Tell of his
[517.66 --> 519.22]  salvation day to day.
[519.70 --> 521.84]  You are exalted, O God, above
[521.84 --> 523.22]  and over
[523.22 --> 525.48]  all creation. And we
[525.48 --> 527.80]  declare your glory among all the nations,
[527.92 --> 529.62]  your marvelous works to all the
[529.62 --> 531.72]  peoples. For great are you,
[531.96 --> 533.70]  Lord, and greatly to be
[533.70 --> 535.54]  praised. And you are
[535.54 --> 537.66]  to be feared above all gods.
[537.72 --> 539.54]  For all the gods of the people are
[539.54 --> 541.72]  worthless idols. But you,
[541.92 --> 543.30]  O Lord, made the heavens
[543.30 --> 545.26]  and you made us.
[546.20 --> 547.66]  And we praise you as
[547.66 --> 549.62]  our God. We
[549.62 --> 551.66]  come this morning to
[551.66 --> 553.20]  this place to adore you,
[553.20 --> 555.54]  to worship you in the
[555.54 --> 556.98]  splendor of your holiness.
[558.12 --> 559.44]  And indeed, O God, this
[559.44 --> 561.26]  morning lead us in our
[561.26 --> 563.14]  worship so that all that we
[563.14 --> 565.24]  say and do in this
[565.24 --> 566.96]  time may be in accordance to your
[566.96 --> 569.02]  will, giving all
[569.02 --> 571.10]  glory and honor and praise
[571.10 --> 574.12]  to you. We pray all of this in the
[574.12 --> 575.56]  matchless name of Jesus
[575.56 --> 577.70]  and all of God's people said,
[577.70 --> 580.04]  Amen. Let's stand.
[580.94 --> 582.14]  And as we receive
[582.14 --> 583.90]  God's greeting to us this
[583.90 --> 584.32]  morning,
[585.44 --> 586.14]  from Isaiah
[586.14 --> 587.48]  chapter 40, verse 3,
[589.98 --> 591.18]  In the wilderness,
[592.02 --> 594.02]  prepare the way for the Lord.
[594.64 --> 596.08]  Make straight in the desert
[596.08 --> 597.02]  a highway
[597.02 --> 599.10]  for our God.
[599.78 --> 601.50]  The peace of the Lord be with you.
[602.02 --> 603.34]  And also with you.
[603.50 --> 605.18]  Let's turn and greet one another
[605.18 --> 605.88]  in that peace.
[605.88 --> 606.00]  Thank you.
[635.18 --> 635.98]  God.
[636.14 --> 640.76]  хозя'
[641.32 --> 642.60]  gymnast.
[643.38 --> 643.54]  guy
[643.54 --> 673.52]  Thank you.
[673.54 --> 682.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[685.32 --> 694.14]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[694.14 --> 699.02]  Truly our hope is in you.
[699.02 --> 705.02]  Truly our hope is in you.
[706.60 --> 711.92]  O Lord, O Lord, our only hope.
[712.32 --> 714.74]  Your way will shine.
[715.02 --> 717.38]  For now you move.
[717.38 --> 722.92]  To you in the dark, Emmanuel, come.
[723.38 --> 727.62]  Come light our hearts.
[727.62 --> 737.36]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[737.36 --> 748.36]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[748.36 --> 753.36]  Truly our hope is in you.
[753.36 --> 759.36]  Truly our hope is in you.
[759.36 --> 766.36]  O joy above all other loves.
[766.36 --> 771.36]  In you we fight more than enough.
[771.36 --> 774.36]  We come as we are.
[774.36 --> 776.36]  Forgiven, restore.
[776.36 --> 777.36]  And restore.
[777.36 --> 781.36]  Come light our hearts.
[781.36 --> 792.36]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[792.36 --> 799.36]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[799.36 --> 803.36]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness fade.
[803.36 --> 810.36]  Truly our hope is in you.
[810.36 --> 816.36]  Truly our hope is in you.
[816.36 --> 817.36]  WhooHoo.
[817.36 --> 833.36]  lf
[833.36 --> 840.36]  be
[844.36 --> 846.36]  Pro executing
[846.36 --> 856.36]  You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all in all.
[859.48 --> 866.60]  Seeking you as a precious jewel, look to give up, I'll be a fool.
[867.10 --> 870.46]  You are my all in all.
[870.46 --> 886.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[886.46 --> 899.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[900.46 --> 909.46]  Taking my sin, my cross, my shame, rising again, I bless your name.
[909.46 --> 915.46]  You are my all in all.
[915.46 --> 924.46]  When I fall down, you pick me up. When I am dry, you fill my cup.
[924.46 --> 929.46]  You are my all in all.
[929.46 --> 944.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[944.46 --> 957.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[957.46 --> 972.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[972.46 --> 987.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[987.46 --> 1006.46]  Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[1006.46 --> 1009.46]  So would you guys like to sit or stand?
[1009.46 --> 1011.46]  You can sit if you want.
[1011.46 --> 1015.46]  Well, yeah, go ahead and have a seat.
[1015.46 --> 1022.46]  Okay, so let's turn to Malachi.
[1022.46 --> 1024.46]  Malachi chapter 4.
[1024.46 --> 1029.46]  That is the last book in the Old Testament.
[1029.46 --> 1031.46]  Malachi chapter 4.
[1031.46 --> 1033.46]  We'll read verses 1 through 6.
[1033.46 --> 1036.46]  That's on page 713 in your pew Bible.
[1036.46 --> 1037.46]  713.
[1037.46 --> 1039.46]  We'll have the words on the screen as well.
[1039.46 --> 1045.46]  Malachi chapter 4, verses 1 through 6.
[1045.46 --> 1046.46]  Surely the day is coming.
[1046.46 --> 1050.46]  It will burn like a furnace.
[1050.46 --> 1055.46]  All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble.
[1055.46 --> 1061.46]  And that day that is coming will set them on fire, says the Lord Almighty.
[1061.46 --> 1064.46]  Not a root or a branch will be left to them.
[1064.46 --> 1072.46]  But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.
[1072.46 --> 1076.46]  And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.
[1076.46 --> 1079.46]  Then you will trample down the wicked.
[1079.46 --> 1085.46]  They will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I do these things, says the Lord Almighty.
[1085.46 --> 1093.46]  Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.
[1093.46 --> 1100.46]  See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.
[1100.46 --> 1106.46]  He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers.
[1106.46 --> 1110.46]  Or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.
[1110.46 --> 1112.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1112.46 --> 1116.46]  Thanks be to God.
[1116.46 --> 1120.46]  So we come now to a time of confession of our sin.
[1120.46 --> 1130.46]  And this time of confession, what it does is allows us to freely see and to name our sin.
[1130.46 --> 1134.46]  So that we may tell the truths about ourselves to the Lord.
[1134.46 --> 1141.46]  And also then to be reminded of the extent of God's grace to us in Jesus Christ.
[1141.46 --> 1151.46]  And so this morning, let's use this traditional prayer from the Book of Common Prayer to confess our sins before Almighty God together.
[1151.46 --> 1154.46]  So would you say this prayer with me?
[1154.46 --> 1167.46]  Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[1167.46 --> 1170.46]  We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1170.46 --> 1174.46]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1174.46 --> 1178.46]  We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
[1178.46 --> 1184.46]  For the sake of your son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us.
[1184.46 --> 1191.46]  That we may delight in your will and walk in your ways to the glory of your name.
[1191.46 --> 1192.46]  Amen.
[1192.46 --> 1203.46]  So I now invite you to take these words that we confess together and bring them into your own hearts and come before the Lord in a private time of confession.
[1203.46 --> 1209.46]  And again, it's seeking to be honest with the ways that we struggle with doubt, with sin.
[1209.46 --> 1216.46]  But most importantly, coming before the Lord, the throne of grace and receiving his mercy that is freely given to us.
[1216.46 --> 1220.46]  So I invite you to take a moment of silent prayer.
[1220.46 --> 1221.46]  Amen.
[1221.46 --> 1222.46]  Amen.
[1222.46 --> 1223.46]  Amen.
[1223.46 --> 1224.46]  Amen.
[1224.46 --> 1225.46]  Amen.
[1225.46 --> 1226.46]  Amen.
[1226.46 --> 1227.46]  Amen.
[1227.46 --> 1228.46]  Amen.
[1228.46 --> 1229.46]  Amen.
[1229.46 --> 1230.46]  Amen.
[1230.46 --> 1231.46]  Evelyn.
[1231.46 --> 1232.46]  Amen.
[1232.46 --> 1233.46]  Amen.
[1233.46 --> 1235.46]  Amen.
[1235.46 --> 1236.46]  Amen.
[1236.46 --> 1237.46]  Yep.
[1237.46 --> 1238.46]  Amen.
[1238.46 --> 1239.46]  Amen.
[1239.46 --> 1240.46]  Amen.
[1240.46 --> 1241.46]  Amen.
[1241.46 --> 1242.46]  Amen.
[1242.46 --> 1243.46]  Amen.
[1243.46 --> 1244.46]  Amen.
[1244.46 --> 1246.56]  Amen.
[1246.56 --> 1247.56]  Amen.
[1247.56 --> 1248.50]  Amen.
[1248.56 --> 1249.52]  Amen.
[1249.52 --> 1251.96]  and with true faith turn to you.
[1252.78 --> 1257.26]  We trust in your promises and ask for your mercy upon us.
[1258.06 --> 1260.40]  Pardon and deliver us from all our sins.
[1261.16 --> 1265.74]  Strengthen us in all goodness and bring us to life everlasting.
[1266.22 --> 1268.02]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray.
[1268.78 --> 1269.22]  Amen.
[1270.60 --> 1275.94]  So friends, God not only hears our hearts and our prayers,
[1276.08 --> 1278.52]  but he then responds to us.
[1278.52 --> 1284.02]  And he responds with words of assurance as we turn our hearts to him in faith.
[1284.40 --> 1290.42]  So let's stand and I invite you to hear what God says to us from 1 John.
[1291.58 --> 1293.78]  This is how God showed his love among us.
[1294.44 --> 1300.00]  He sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him.
[1300.80 --> 1304.64]  And that's what we celebrate in this season of Advent and Christmas.
[1304.64 --> 1308.42]  So let's remain standing and let's also sing of God's grace to us.
[1308.52 --> 1309.78]  God said.
[1320.04 --> 1321.78]  God said.
[1321.78 --> 1343.76]  I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[1343.76 --> 1351.76]  I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[1351.78 --> 1364.78]  I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[1367.78 --> 1380.78]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1381.78 --> 1388.52]  Amazing love, how I know it's true.
[1390.78 --> 1394.78]  It's my choice to honor you.
[1395.78 --> 1401.78]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1401.78 --> 1411.52]  I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[1411.52 --> 1419.26]  I'm accepted, you were condemned.
[1420.52 --> 1432.76]  I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[1432.76 --> 1447.76]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1447.76 --> 1456.76]  Amazing love, how can it be?
[1456.76 --> 1465.76]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1465.76 --> 1477.76]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1477.76 --> 1478.76]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1478.76 --> 1482.76]  Amazing love, how can it be if you're my king and died for me?
[1482.76 --> 1511.52]  Another thing who name is Jesus Christ, who's my king and died turned out instead of you were
[1511.52 --> 1513.52]  Amen.
[1541.52 --> 1548.00]  My gift of grace is Jesus, my Redeemer.
[1549.16 --> 1555.12]  There is no more for heaven not to give.
[1556.70 --> 1562.96]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[1562.96 --> 1571.14]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[1571.52 --> 1577.92]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1579.50 --> 1586.24]  For my life is holy bound to this.
[1586.24 --> 1592.58]  Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[1592.86 --> 1600.60]  All is mine yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1601.52 --> 1611.62]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[1612.72 --> 1618.64]  For by my side, the Savior, He will stay.
[1618.64 --> 1626.64]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing.
[1626.64 --> 1633.64]  For in my need, His power is displayed.
[1633.64 --> 1641.64]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[1641.64 --> 1648.64]  Through the deepest valley, He will lead.
[1648.64 --> 1657.64]  Oh, the night has been warm, and I shall overcome.
[1657.64 --> 1664.64]  For in my heart, I know I am forgiven.
[1664.64 --> 1674.84]  Oh, fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[1674.84 --> 1682.64]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid.
[1682.64 --> 1683.26]  Next, the purpose of the suffering, I am forgiven.
[1683.32 --> 1683.64]  This is right, it is notимоmäßig.
[1683.64 --> 1686.64]  My Jordan, it is not important for me, but in my heart.
[1686.64 --> 1689.64]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[1690.02 --> 1697.62]  Then He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[1697.62 --> 1712.08]  To this I hope my sin has been defeated, Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[1713.20 --> 1727.08]  All the chains are released, I can see I am free, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1727.62 --> 1728.62]  Amen.
[1757.62 --> 1758.62]  Thank you.
[1758.62 --> 1759.62]  Thank you.
[1759.62 --> 1760.62]  Thank you.
[1760.62 --> 1761.62] 
[1790.62 --> 1791.62] 
[1820.62 --> 1821.62]  Thank you.
[1821.62 --> 1822.62]  Thank you.
[1822.62 --> 1823.62]  Thank you.
[1823.62 --> 1824.62]  Thank you.
[1824.62 --> 1826.62]  Thank you.
[1826.62 --> 1829.62]  All right.
[1829.62 --> 1835.62]  The children are dismissed with their teachers and assistants to go to their classes.
[1835.62 --> 1836.62]  Thank you.
[1836.62 --> 1837.62]  Thank you.
[1837.62 --> 1844.80]  And quick announcement I didn't mention at the beginning, but we have these new Bible reading
[1844.80 --> 1848.12]  bookmarks that have been inserted into your bulletins.
[1848.12 --> 1853.24]  And I encourage you, and maybe you already have something that you read regularly, we have
[1853.24 --> 1855.12]  the Today devotional.
[1855.12 --> 1862.12]  But whatever it may be, I would encourage you in this season of Advent from December 1st
[1862.12 --> 1868.12]  to December 24th to maybe have a new commitment to read the Bible every day.
[1868.12 --> 1871.12]  And the readings are actually quite short during the season.
[1871.12 --> 1877.12]  So I encourage you just to take this, spend some time in God's Word as we prepare our hearts
[1877.12 --> 1881.12]  for the coming of our Savior during this Advent season.
[1881.12 --> 1887.12]  And a quick note, you know how sometimes, well, you know in the stores you buy Advent calendars?
[1887.12 --> 1889.12]  And they always start what day?
[1889.12 --> 1890.12]  December 1st.
[1890.12 --> 1893.12]  This year, it aligns.
[1893.12 --> 1899.12]  The actual start of Advent and the, you know, the stuff you buy in the stores are aligned.
[1899.12 --> 1904.12]  So you buy those Advent calendars and it's accurate this year.
[1904.12 --> 1908.12]  So let's turn to God's Word this morning.
[1908.12 --> 1915.12]  And speaking of Advent, let me just take a moment to explain this because maybe the church calendar
[1915.12 --> 1919.12]  isn't as familiar to some of you here.
[1919.12 --> 1925.12]  So in the same way that we have a national calendar, you know, we have our statutory holidays
[1925.12 --> 1931.12]  that mark the yearly cycle, and just how we have a school calendar with the beginning of school,
[1931.12 --> 1933.12]  the end, and breaks, and exams.
[1933.12 --> 1936.12]  We have all kinds of different calendars, sports calendars.
[1936.12 --> 1940.12]  The church also has a calendar.
[1940.12 --> 1945.12]  And it's a calendar that revolves around the life of Jesus.
[1945.12 --> 1952.12]  His coming, his birth, his life, his death, his resurrection, his ascension into heaven.
[1952.12 --> 1959.12]  And we begin the church year in Advent.
[1959.12 --> 1966.12]  And we begin with actually anticipation of the coming of Jesus at Christmas.
[1966.12 --> 1973.12]  And so, in a way, it kind of feels like a false start, doesn't it?
[1973.12 --> 1981.12]  I mean, we're kicking off the new year, not with celebrating, but with waiting.
[1981.12 --> 1983.12]  It's kind of weird, right?
[1983.12 --> 1986.12]  Christians kind of do New Year's weird.
[1986.12 --> 1989.12]  We don't start with fanfare and champagne.
[1989.12 --> 1996.12]  We kick off in a minor key with cries from lowly exile here.
[1996.12 --> 2001.12]  With fast, with a fast before the feast.
[2001.12 --> 2006.12]  And the church for a very long time has said that Advent is a season of waiting.
[2006.12 --> 2009.12]  A season of longing and anticipation.
[2009.12 --> 2017.12]  You know, for Israel, they waited for many long centuries for the promised Messiah to come.
[2017.12 --> 2022.12]  And he did come, right, many years ago on that first Advent.
[2022.12 --> 2027.12]  And in the same way, the church now awaits the return of the king.
[2027.12 --> 2031.12]  When he will come again at the second Advent.
[2031.12 --> 2034.12]  And that's what we, as the church today, long for.
[2034.12 --> 2039.12]  We long, like the people of Israel did, we long for the coming of the king.
[2039.12 --> 2043.12]  And that's what we are getting ready for in this season.
[2043.12 --> 2049.12]  And so, to help us to observe this season, we're beginning a new sermon series called Preparing the Way.
[2049.12 --> 2051.12]  Preparing the Way.
[2051.12 --> 2055.12]  And we're looking at the life of John the Baptist.
[2055.12 --> 2056.12]  Right?
[2056.12 --> 2061.12]  John the Baptist is this character we find in the early chapters of the gospel.
[2061.12 --> 2064.12]  Kind of interspersed with the coming of Jesus.
[2064.12 --> 2071.12]  And it was his vocation to prepare God's people for the coming of Christ.
[2071.12 --> 2074.12]  And so that's what we will be looking at this Advent season.
[2074.12 --> 2078.12]  This, the life and the vocation of John the Baptist.
[2078.12 --> 2083.12]  Will mostly be focused, well I think exclusively, in the Gospel of Luke.
[2083.12 --> 2088.12]  So let's open our Bibles to Luke chapter 1 verses 5 to 25.
[2088.12 --> 2097.12]  And here we have the foretelling of John's birth to his parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth.
[2097.12 --> 2104.12]  So Luke chapter 1.
[2104.12 --> 2109.12]  Luke 1 is a very, very long chapter, if you've noticed.
[2109.12 --> 2113.12]  We'll read verses 5 to 25 this morning.
[2113.12 --> 2116.12]  That is on page 760 in your pew Bible.
[2116.12 --> 2117.12]  760.
[2117.12 --> 2120.12]  Luke chapter 1 starting in verse 5.
[2120.12 --> 2121.12]  In the time of the man's birth,
[2121.12 --> 2130.12]  In the time of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zachariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.
[2131.12 --> 2135.12]  His wife, Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.
[2135.12 --> 2141.12]  Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
[2141.12 --> 2147.12]  But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren and they were both well along in years.
[2147.12 --> 2153.20]  Once, when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
[2153.78 --> 2157.54]  he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood,
[2157.94 --> 2160.56]  to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
[2161.52 --> 2163.82]  And when the time for the burning of incense came,
[2164.60 --> 2167.48]  all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
[2168.54 --> 2171.64]  Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him,
[2172.42 --> 2174.80]  standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
[2174.80 --> 2179.56]  When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
[2180.40 --> 2181.68]  But the angel said to him,
[2181.78 --> 2183.04]  Do not be afraid, Zechariah.
[2183.58 --> 2185.20]  Your prayer has been heard.
[2185.70 --> 2190.58]  Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
[2191.20 --> 2196.06]  He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth.
[2196.58 --> 2198.80]  For he will be great in the sight of the Lord.
[2199.26 --> 2203.04]  He is never to take wine or other fermented drink.
[2203.04 --> 2204.46]  That means he was a Nazarite.
[2204.80 --> 2208.68]  And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from birth.
[2209.64 --> 2215.80]  Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
[2216.18 --> 2219.90]  And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah,
[2220.56 --> 2222.98]  to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children,
[2223.40 --> 2225.90]  and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,
[2226.38 --> 2229.42]  to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
[2229.42 --> 2231.84]  Zechariah asked the angel,
[2232.50 --> 2234.00]  How can I be sure of this?
[2234.30 --> 2238.74]  I am an old man, and my wife is, well, she's well along in years.
[2239.82 --> 2241.04]  The angel answered,
[2241.04 --> 2243.42]  I am Gabriel.
[2243.42 --> 2250.74]  I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to you to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
[2251.42 --> 2256.22]  And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens,
[2256.22 --> 2261.36]  because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.
[2261.36 --> 2267.38]  Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
[2267.94 --> 2270.60]  When he came out, he could not speak to them.
[2270.88 --> 2273.08]  They realized he had seen a vision in the temple,
[2273.66 --> 2277.72]  for he kept making signs to them, but remained unable to speak.
[2278.58 --> 2281.42]  When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
[2282.20 --> 2284.26]  After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant,
[2284.80 --> 2286.76]  and for five months remained in seclusion.
[2286.76 --> 2289.44]  The Lord has done this for me, she said,
[2289.86 --> 2294.68]  and these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.
[2295.50 --> 2296.78]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2298.68 --> 2300.60]  So let's pray as we begin.
[2305.60 --> 2309.26]  Lord, thank you for this moment right now,
[2309.42 --> 2312.08]  that we get to sit here with your word,
[2312.70 --> 2315.80]  and to consider these things, to consider a very old story.
[2316.76 --> 2319.06]  That's connected to an even older story.
[2319.92 --> 2323.38]  And Lord, we wonder how it might connect to our story.
[2323.82 --> 2326.44]  How it might connect even to our lives today.
[2327.32 --> 2329.68]  And I pray, Lord, that you would create those connections,
[2330.54 --> 2334.24]  and that you would open our ears, our hearts, our minds,
[2334.34 --> 2337.36]  to hear your voice above all other voices.
[2338.10 --> 2339.48]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[2340.04 --> 2340.46]  Amen.
[2340.46 --> 2347.94]  So here in this text, we have this incredible story of Zechariah and Elizabeth
[2347.94 --> 2352.22]  and the angel Gabriel and foretelling the birth of John the Baptist.
[2353.18 --> 2356.74]  This figure, again, that we meet early in the New Testament,
[2357.48 --> 2364.16]  whose role in redemptive history is to prepare the world for the coming of Christ.
[2364.16 --> 2369.28]  And so let's see more of this together as we look at God's word,
[2369.88 --> 2374.82]  how John the Baptist's birth teaches us to wait upon the Lord,
[2375.42 --> 2381.58]  and how we can be prepared, we can be a people prepared for Christ's coming
[2381.58 --> 2384.54]  into our own lives and into our own hearts.
[2384.54 --> 2388.46]  So as we look at this, we're going to consider it from a few different angles.
[2388.62 --> 2392.12]  If you're someone who takes notes, here is our outline for today.
[2392.36 --> 2394.76]  We're going to talk about the place of preparation,
[2395.60 --> 2397.48]  the path of preparation,
[2397.90 --> 2401.20]  and then finally the purpose of preparation.
[2401.56 --> 2402.38]  Okay, so that's our outline.
[2402.46 --> 2406.26]  The place, the path, and the purpose of preparation.
[2406.80 --> 2409.26]  So let's begin with the place, the place of preparation.
[2409.92 --> 2414.44]  And let's look again at our text beginning in verse 5.
[2415.20 --> 2416.04]  Again, it says,
[2416.14 --> 2418.04]  In the time of King Herod of Judea,
[2418.86 --> 2420.52]  there was a priest named Zechariah,
[2420.98 --> 2424.26]  who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.
[2425.12 --> 2428.90]  His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
[2430.20 --> 2432.86]  Both of them were righteous in the sight of God,
[2432.86 --> 2436.42]  observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.
[2437.12 --> 2443.66]  So in this story, Luke begins by introducing us to an elderly couple.
[2443.66 --> 2451.54]  They are living out in the countryside surrounding the capital city of Jerusalem.
[2452.66 --> 2454.88]  Their names are Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[2455.14 --> 2458.48]  And they both come from this priestly pedigree.
[2458.60 --> 2460.74]  They both come from this priestly line of Aaron,
[2461.54 --> 2464.10]  which was considered a double blessing.
[2464.10 --> 2470.32]  And then Luke says that they are righteous in the sight of God.
[2470.44 --> 2471.56]  What does that mean?
[2472.64 --> 2475.18]  Does that mean that they are sinless?
[2475.82 --> 2479.08]  Does it mean that they are super Christians?
[2480.76 --> 2481.54]  Not at all.
[2481.58 --> 2482.38]  That's not what it means.
[2482.54 --> 2485.82]  They had original sin, just like all of us.
[2485.82 --> 2491.84]  They surely, you know, had missteps along the way, just like all of us do.
[2492.74 --> 2496.36]  But as a general description of their lives, they were righteous.
[2497.28 --> 2501.56]  They were faithful and sincere in keeping God's commandments.
[2502.34 --> 2502.58]  Right?
[2502.62 --> 2503.68]  They lived holy lives.
[2504.52 --> 2506.16]  So here we have this couple.
[2506.92 --> 2508.04]  And if you can imagine them,
[2508.10 --> 2511.58]  they are a couple who you would want to be your neighbor.
[2512.16 --> 2512.40]  Right?
[2512.40 --> 2513.76]  They are a lovely couple.
[2513.98 --> 2515.08]  They love God.
[2515.22 --> 2516.92]  They want to serve him.
[2518.46 --> 2520.54]  But there's a tragedy in their lives.
[2521.00 --> 2522.74]  There's a burden that they carry,
[2522.96 --> 2525.34]  which is that they do not have a child.
[2526.16 --> 2527.54]  So verse 7 says,
[2528.12 --> 2531.32]  but they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive,
[2531.64 --> 2532.94]  and they were both very old.
[2534.38 --> 2537.06]  And so it would seem that not having a child
[2537.06 --> 2541.98]  was the great disappointment of Elizabeth and Zechariah's life.
[2543.30 --> 2545.24]  And you know, for you and I today,
[2545.38 --> 2547.22]  if you want to have kids,
[2547.42 --> 2549.56]  but you are unable to have kids,
[2549.96 --> 2554.04]  there is real pain and real sorrow
[2554.04 --> 2557.88]  and real heartache in that situation.
[2559.16 --> 2561.74]  But the pain and the sorrow and the heartbreak
[2561.74 --> 2565.94]  that we experience is largely around an unmet desire.
[2566.58 --> 2566.74]  Right?
[2566.74 --> 2568.76]  You know, you want something,
[2568.86 --> 2569.82]  you hope for something,
[2570.06 --> 2571.50]  it's something good,
[2571.70 --> 2573.94]  but you don't have it.
[2574.00 --> 2575.20]  So it's an unmet desire.
[2576.24 --> 2581.20]  Now that same thing is compounded tremendously in the first century.
[2581.82 --> 2583.94]  Because in that first century,
[2584.44 --> 2585.20]  kids,
[2585.84 --> 2588.40]  they were not only your present joy,
[2589.06 --> 2590.80]  but they were also your future hope.
[2590.80 --> 2596.24]  So not only the joy of getting to raise the kids of your own,
[2596.68 --> 2598.92]  but those kids were also your retirement plan.
[2599.78 --> 2601.26]  If you didn't have kids,
[2601.42 --> 2602.52]  you could never retire.
[2603.22 --> 2604.60]  You could never stop working.
[2604.74 --> 2607.06]  And there is no one to care for you in your old age
[2607.06 --> 2610.12]  as you slow down and as your health fails.
[2611.38 --> 2612.98]  Kids also,
[2613.34 --> 2615.02]  not only were they your retirement plan,
[2615.02 --> 2620.20]  they were your future hope of participating in the story of God's people.
[2621.30 --> 2621.50]  Right?
[2621.58 --> 2623.70]  Remember back in the book of Exodus,
[2623.98 --> 2626.60]  God's covenant promises to his people
[2626.60 --> 2631.10]  that he was going to create a people for himself from Abraham.
[2632.14 --> 2635.08]  And that generation after generation,
[2635.86 --> 2638.04]  God would be their people and they,
[2639.00 --> 2642.28]  God would be their God and they would be his people.
[2642.28 --> 2645.20]  And that promise never goes away.
[2646.50 --> 2649.74]  And so one of the ways that a first century Jew would conceive
[2649.74 --> 2651.96]  of what it means to be part of the people of God
[2651.96 --> 2653.64]  is to have kids.
[2654.14 --> 2657.62]  So that those kids can be part of God's future
[2657.62 --> 2659.80]  and they could be part of the people of God
[2659.80 --> 2661.18]  from generation to generation.
[2661.62 --> 2663.00]  And if you don't have kids,
[2663.28 --> 2665.88]  it's like your part of the story stops.
[2667.08 --> 2670.66]  You're a character in a sense that gets written out of the story.
[2670.66 --> 2674.58]  And so the heartache of Zechariah and Elizabeth
[2674.58 --> 2678.98]  is not only unmet desire, as painful as that is,
[2679.40 --> 2683.86]  it's the loss of a future hope in this life for them
[2683.86 --> 2687.20]  where no one will be able to take care of them.
[2688.00 --> 2689.88]  But it's also a spiritual disappointment
[2689.88 --> 2693.70]  that they will, when they pass away,
[2693.80 --> 2696.34]  no longer be part of the story
[2696.34 --> 2698.42]  of what God is doing in the world any longer.
[2698.42 --> 2702.78]  And this was a source of great longing
[2702.78 --> 2706.58]  and also great disappointment for Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[2707.90 --> 2709.54]  And, you know, we read this and we're like,
[2709.58 --> 2710.96]  oh, they're such wonderful people.
[2711.44 --> 2713.40]  And, you know, you're kind of rooting for them.
[2713.50 --> 2715.62]  And, you know, your heart breaks for them.
[2717.22 --> 2718.92]  So what we should notice here
[2718.92 --> 2722.66]  is that it is entirely possible for you and I
[2722.66 --> 2726.62]  to be faithful to God, even righteous before God,
[2727.02 --> 2731.18]  and yet still live with unmet longings,
[2731.44 --> 2732.46]  with disappointment.
[2732.46 --> 2737.90]  And when that happens, you know,
[2737.94 --> 2740.50]  when we have these longings that we have in life
[2740.50 --> 2744.86]  and God's not seeming to answer us,
[2744.86 --> 2747.76]  it can make us feel like a curse.
[2748.54 --> 2751.06]  It can make us feel like God's,
[2751.54 --> 2753.12]  it's like it's God's judgment.
[2753.12 --> 2756.96]  Like, what have I done wrong, God?
[2758.40 --> 2761.40]  Why am I not given this blessing
[2761.40 --> 2764.52]  when so many other people are?
[2766.92 --> 2768.24]  And so here's a question
[2768.24 --> 2770.56]  I want to just pose to you this morning.
[2771.92 --> 2773.66]  Where do you, this morning,
[2773.98 --> 2776.62]  most feel the disappointment
[2776.62 --> 2779.12]  of unmet longings?
[2779.12 --> 2783.46]  Do you feel it in your family?
[2784.26 --> 2784.40]  Right?
[2784.46 --> 2786.98]  The desire to have the kind of family
[2786.98 --> 2788.56]  you've always pictured.
[2790.94 --> 2792.94]  Do you feel it in your work
[2792.94 --> 2793.96]  or your retirement?
[2795.24 --> 2796.06]  You know, asking like,
[2796.14 --> 2797.44]  will I ever make a difference?
[2798.22 --> 2801.80]  Will I actually be fulfilled in what I do?
[2802.62 --> 2804.58]  Will I be able to make the impact
[2804.58 --> 2806.28]  that I long to make?
[2806.28 --> 2809.44]  How about money?
[2809.94 --> 2811.42]  Will I ever have enough?
[2812.28 --> 2814.14]  Or will I always be that person
[2814.14 --> 2816.28]  who can't afford things?
[2818.24 --> 2819.70]  Or what about your health?
[2819.90 --> 2822.10]  Will I ever not be in pain?
[2823.96 --> 2824.34]  Right?
[2824.38 --> 2825.38]  And when we have these,
[2825.48 --> 2828.28]  these feelings of unmet desires
[2828.28 --> 2829.52]  and unmet longings,
[2829.56 --> 2830.64]  even good things,
[2831.14 --> 2832.88]  and maybe when we're feeling
[2832.88 --> 2834.66]  that God maybe is judging us,
[2834.66 --> 2836.08]  I think it is important for us
[2836.08 --> 2838.00]  to remember Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[2838.80 --> 2839.02]  Right?
[2839.08 --> 2840.38]  And their story teaches us that,
[2840.50 --> 2841.40]  again, it's possible
[2841.40 --> 2843.34]  that we experience
[2843.34 --> 2844.86]  just the barrenness of life,
[2845.80 --> 2847.20]  the disappointments of life,
[2847.20 --> 2849.90]  even when we are children of God,
[2849.98 --> 2851.22]  even when we are
[2851.22 --> 2853.98]  being, you know,
[2854.04 --> 2855.52]  righteous in God's sight.
[2855.52 --> 2858.62]  And their story also shows us
[2858.62 --> 2859.72]  that for most of us,
[2860.28 --> 2861.52]  whatever disappointments
[2861.52 --> 2862.18]  or emptiness
[2862.18 --> 2863.48]  that we have in our lives,
[2863.74 --> 2865.18]  that is the place
[2865.18 --> 2866.70]  that we most need
[2866.70 --> 2868.28]  to hear God's voice.
[2868.98 --> 2870.32]  That is the very place
[2870.32 --> 2871.50]  we most need God
[2871.50 --> 2872.56]  to come to us
[2872.56 --> 2874.06]  and to meet us.
[2875.66 --> 2876.58]  That is the place
[2876.58 --> 2877.38]  where God wants us
[2877.38 --> 2878.18]  to trust in him.
[2878.18 --> 2881.52]  And if I can just also
[2881.52 --> 2882.36]  turn our thoughts
[2882.36 --> 2882.84]  for a moment
[2882.84 --> 2884.12]  outside of our own
[2884.12 --> 2885.00]  unmet desires,
[2886.04 --> 2886.84]  but outward,
[2887.80 --> 2888.44]  let's remember
[2888.44 --> 2889.84]  that the people around us
[2889.84 --> 2890.64]  in our lives,
[2890.72 --> 2891.92]  the people sitting here,
[2892.48 --> 2894.12]  the people elsewhere
[2894.12 --> 2894.90]  in our lives,
[2895.12 --> 2896.26]  they also have
[2896.26 --> 2897.50]  those places of emptiness.
[2898.64 --> 2900.36]  They also have places
[2900.36 --> 2901.72]  of unmet longings.
[2902.78 --> 2904.34]  And for most of us,
[2904.44 --> 2905.08]  for our neighbors,
[2905.82 --> 2907.48]  those places are very private.
[2908.18 --> 2909.20]  But they're there.
[2910.62 --> 2911.64]  They are there
[2911.64 --> 2912.26]  in the lives
[2912.26 --> 2912.84]  of our neighbors,
[2913.12 --> 2913.84]  our co-workers,
[2914.08 --> 2914.72]  our classmates,
[2915.24 --> 2917.04]  as well as in our own lives.
[2918.02 --> 2919.22]  And that is the place
[2919.22 --> 2920.22]  that they also
[2920.22 --> 2921.46]  most need to hear
[2921.46 --> 2922.22]  the voice of God
[2922.22 --> 2922.88]  speak to them.
[2923.94 --> 2924.58]  And so,
[2924.76 --> 2926.82]  you might actually
[2926.82 --> 2927.80]  be the one
[2927.80 --> 2928.64]  who at some point
[2928.64 --> 2929.68]  is given the opportunity
[2929.68 --> 2931.92]  to be the voice of God,
[2932.38 --> 2934.72]  to speak on behalf of God
[2934.72 --> 2936.44]  into that place
[2936.44 --> 2937.50]  of disappointment
[2937.50 --> 2938.12]  and longing.
[2938.18 --> 2940.42]  Okay, but
[2940.42 --> 2941.94]  the point is
[2941.94 --> 2942.66]  those are
[2942.66 --> 2944.04]  the places of preparation.
[2944.90 --> 2945.50]  Those places
[2945.50 --> 2946.62]  of unmet longings
[2946.62 --> 2947.18]  that we have
[2947.18 --> 2947.86]  where we
[2947.86 --> 2949.14]  most need
[2949.14 --> 2950.80]  Christ to come
[2950.80 --> 2951.98]  and meet us
[2951.98 --> 2953.32]  and to speak to us.
[2954.62 --> 2955.64]  And that is,
[2955.74 --> 2958.56]  that's where
[2958.56 --> 2959.44]  Zechariah and Elizabeth
[2959.44 --> 2960.30]  are in this story.
[2960.46 --> 2961.44]  But the thing is,
[2961.48 --> 2961.66]  you know,
[2961.70 --> 2962.96]  for them and for us,
[2963.28 --> 2964.54]  even when we want
[2964.54 --> 2965.52]  God to answer our prayers,
[2965.62 --> 2966.60]  we want him to come
[2966.60 --> 2967.26]  into our lives
[2967.26 --> 2967.80]  and meet us
[2967.80 --> 2968.44]  in those places,
[2968.44 --> 2969.98]  it's not always
[2969.98 --> 2971.34]  actually so simple.
[2972.56 --> 2973.22]  I mean,
[2973.36 --> 2974.52]  we might
[2974.52 --> 2976.70]  not be ready
[2976.70 --> 2978.94]  to meet God
[2978.94 --> 2979.86]  there
[2979.86 --> 2981.24]  in those places.
[2981.56 --> 2982.46]  And that is
[2982.46 --> 2983.36]  what we see happening
[2983.36 --> 2984.24]  in Zechariah's story
[2984.24 --> 2984.64]  as well.
[2985.10 --> 2985.30]  And so,
[2985.36 --> 2985.80]  that leads us
[2985.80 --> 2986.32]  to the second
[2986.32 --> 2987.66]  point this morning,
[2987.66 --> 2988.24]  which is
[2988.24 --> 2988.86]  the path
[2988.86 --> 2989.46]  of preparation.
[2989.46 --> 2990.66]  say,
[2990.74 --> 2991.74]  once we acknowledge
[2991.74 --> 2992.64]  that place
[2992.64 --> 2993.86]  of preparation,
[2994.46 --> 2995.36]  how do we
[2995.36 --> 2996.20]  walk that path?
[2996.28 --> 2996.78]  How do we
[2996.78 --> 2998.24]  prepare our hearts
[2998.24 --> 2999.48]  to receive God's voice,
[2999.56 --> 3000.40]  to hear from him,
[3000.52 --> 3001.44]  and to trust him?
[3002.06 --> 3002.42]  So,
[3002.48 --> 3002.90]  let's go back
[3002.90 --> 3003.46]  to our text
[3003.46 --> 3003.92]  this morning.
[3005.24 --> 3005.40]  Now,
[3005.52 --> 3006.86]  Zechariah is a priest
[3006.86 --> 3008.16]  and he is
[3008.16 --> 3009.40]  working
[3009.40 --> 3010.54]  in this story.
[3010.88 --> 3011.04]  Right?
[3011.12 --> 3011.96]  He's in the office.
[3012.42 --> 3013.58]  He's on active duty.
[3013.80 --> 3014.94]  It's his turn
[3014.94 --> 3016.26]  to serve
[3016.26 --> 3017.20]  in the sanctuary
[3017.20 --> 3018.34]  in Jerusalem,
[3018.46 --> 3018.92]  in the temple.
[3020.12 --> 3020.26]  And,
[3020.34 --> 3020.44]  you know,
[3020.48 --> 3021.26]  because what you
[3021.26 --> 3021.74]  might not know
[3021.74 --> 3022.26]  is that there
[3022.26 --> 3023.22]  were thousands
[3023.22 --> 3024.16]  of priests
[3024.16 --> 3025.24]  at that time.
[3025.78 --> 3025.98]  Right?
[3026.02 --> 3026.90]  If you can imagine
[3026.90 --> 3027.48]  Aaron,
[3027.58 --> 3028.30]  the first prince,
[3028.40 --> 3029.08]  and his children,
[3029.34 --> 3030.16]  and then they have children,
[3030.34 --> 3031.22]  and you can imagine
[3031.22 --> 3032.12]  the branches
[3032.12 --> 3032.94]  of this tree,
[3033.52 --> 3034.18]  and now
[3034.18 --> 3035.88]  there are thousands
[3035.88 --> 3036.42]  and thousands
[3036.42 --> 3037.04]  of priests.
[3038.20 --> 3038.54]  And so,
[3038.64 --> 3039.42]  for Zechariah,
[3039.54 --> 3040.76]  he might only
[3040.76 --> 3041.44]  have this one
[3041.44 --> 3042.86]  opportunity in his life
[3042.86 --> 3044.96]  to go into the temple
[3044.96 --> 3046.38]  and to do this
[3046.38 --> 3047.64]  priestly duty.
[3048.04 --> 3048.24]  So,
[3048.30 --> 3048.98]  his job
[3048.98 --> 3049.76]  would be to go
[3049.76 --> 3050.80]  into the holy place
[3050.80 --> 3052.68]  to cast incense
[3052.68 --> 3054.18]  on the altar
[3054.18 --> 3056.50]  to prostrate himself
[3056.50 --> 3058.16]  and then to withdraw
[3058.16 --> 3059.90]  almost immediately.
[3060.52 --> 3061.68]  No delaying.
[3062.10 --> 3063.12]  No hanging out
[3063.12 --> 3063.84]  in the holy place.
[3064.88 --> 3065.12]  And so,
[3065.26 --> 3066.16]  picture it with me.
[3066.28 --> 3067.20]  And there's this image
[3067.20 --> 3068.06]  I found online
[3068.06 --> 3068.64]  which I thought
[3068.64 --> 3069.62]  was a nice rendering
[3069.62 --> 3071.94]  of what this would look like,
[3072.64 --> 3073.50]  the holy place
[3073.50 --> 3073.98]  of the temple.
[3073.98 --> 3074.92]  So,
[3074.92 --> 3076.36]  it would be very dim.
[3077.48 --> 3078.58]  Lit only by
[3078.58 --> 3079.60]  those candle,
[3080.40 --> 3081.84]  the candle light
[3081.84 --> 3082.26]  of that,
[3082.34 --> 3082.92]  the holy
[3082.92 --> 3084.72]  lampstand,
[3084.92 --> 3085.06]  right?
[3085.10 --> 3086.20]  Remember that Moses
[3086.20 --> 3087.02]  was to put into
[3087.02 --> 3087.72]  the tabernacle
[3087.72 --> 3088.70]  with the seven
[3088.70 --> 3089.44]  candlesticks?
[3089.44 --> 3093.16]  it would be quiet,
[3093.96 --> 3095.44]  out of the heat,
[3095.52 --> 3096.32]  out of the noise
[3096.32 --> 3098.02]  of that busy temple area
[3098.02 --> 3098.78]  right outside,
[3099.56 --> 3100.32]  right away from all
[3100.32 --> 3100.98]  those people
[3100.98 --> 3102.04]  gathered to pray,
[3102.72 --> 3104.18]  all those people
[3104.18 --> 3105.38]  who wanted to be there,
[3106.84 --> 3107.10]  you know,
[3107.14 --> 3107.82]  and away from all
[3107.82 --> 3108.74]  those animals
[3108.74 --> 3110.44]  that absolutely
[3110.44 --> 3111.40]  did not want to be there.
[3111.40 --> 3113.86]  And there would be
[3113.86 --> 3114.94]  that pungent smell
[3114.94 --> 3115.76]  of incense
[3115.76 --> 3118.26]  because it was burned
[3118.26 --> 3119.12]  every morning
[3119.12 --> 3120.64]  and every evening,
[3121.02 --> 3121.82]  every day
[3121.82 --> 3123.00]  of every year
[3123.00 --> 3123.98]  for centuries.
[3125.20 --> 3126.32]  And on the altar
[3126.32 --> 3126.98]  of incense,
[3127.02 --> 3127.72]  that's what you see there,
[3127.78 --> 3128.32]  that little table,
[3128.42 --> 3128.72]  that's called
[3128.72 --> 3129.66]  the altar of incense,
[3129.96 --> 3130.72]  that's where you would
[3130.72 --> 3131.52]  burn the incense
[3131.52 --> 3133.72]  which is right in front
[3133.72 --> 3135.26]  of the most holy place
[3135.26 --> 3136.14]  behind that curtain
[3136.14 --> 3138.22]  where the high priest
[3138.22 --> 3139.10]  would only go
[3139.10 --> 3139.60]  once a year.
[3139.60 --> 3142.46]  And so standing there,
[3142.80 --> 3143.60]  you would remember
[3143.60 --> 3144.64]  the stories of people
[3144.64 --> 3145.66]  who had died
[3145.66 --> 3146.74]  who didn't show
[3146.74 --> 3148.10]  proper respect
[3148.10 --> 3149.40]  in carrying out
[3149.40 --> 3150.60]  those duties.
[3151.90 --> 3152.50]  Can you imagine
[3152.50 --> 3153.34]  the weight
[3153.34 --> 3154.54]  of this job,
[3155.02 --> 3156.58]  the gravity of it,
[3156.66 --> 3157.94]  the sense of foreboding,
[3158.06 --> 3158.70]  the holiness
[3158.70 --> 3161.66]  of that duty and place.
[3161.84 --> 3162.38]  So Zechariah
[3162.38 --> 3163.34]  is standing there
[3163.34 --> 3165.04]  in front of this curtain
[3165.04 --> 3166.22]  decorated with
[3166.22 --> 3167.52]  guardian cherubim
[3167.52 --> 3169.40]  and what happens?
[3169.60 --> 3171.28]  Gabriel
[3171.28 --> 3173.56]  gives him
[3173.56 --> 3174.32]  the jump scare
[3174.32 --> 3174.92]  of his life.
[3175.72 --> 3177.12]  So look at verse 11.
[3178.62 --> 3179.70]  Then an angel
[3179.70 --> 3180.40]  of the Lord
[3180.40 --> 3181.52]  appeared to him
[3181.52 --> 3182.72]  standing at the right
[3182.72 --> 3184.06]  hand side
[3184.06 --> 3184.56]  of the altar
[3184.56 --> 3185.14]  of incense.
[3185.56 --> 3186.72]  When Zechariah saw him,
[3187.24 --> 3188.06]  he was startled
[3188.06 --> 3188.80]  and was gripped
[3188.80 --> 3189.40]  with fear.
[3191.86 --> 3192.70]  So Gabriel
[3192.70 --> 3195.04]  appears to Zechariah.
[3195.10 --> 3195.80]  We learn his name
[3195.80 --> 3196.94]  later in verse 19.
[3197.64 --> 3198.98]  He's one of only
[3198.98 --> 3199.78]  two angels
[3199.78 --> 3200.36]  who are named
[3200.36 --> 3200.98]  in scriptures.
[3201.22 --> 3201.62]  Gabriel.
[3201.82 --> 3202.52]  We see him back
[3202.52 --> 3203.26]  in the book
[3203.26 --> 3204.26]  of Daniel as well.
[3205.46 --> 3205.76]  Trivia,
[3206.04 --> 3206.60]  who's the other
[3206.60 --> 3207.38]  angel named?
[3211.38 --> 3211.86]  Michael.
[3212.22 --> 3212.40]  Yeah,
[3212.62 --> 3212.84]  Michael.
[3213.50 --> 3213.62]  Okay,
[3213.66 --> 3214.40]  so Gabriel and Michael.
[3214.52 --> 3215.22]  But here's Gabriel.
[3215.22 --> 3215.28]  Gabriel,
[3216.16 --> 3217.38]  the angel
[3217.38 --> 3219.62]  has been sent
[3219.62 --> 3220.78]  as a messenger.
[3221.74 --> 3221.94]  I mean,
[3221.96 --> 3222.58]  that makes sense
[3222.58 --> 3223.92]  because the word
[3223.92 --> 3224.96]  angel means messenger.
[3226.30 --> 3227.10]  And his message
[3227.10 --> 3228.52]  is an announcement.
[3229.06 --> 3230.62]  It is good news.
[3230.70 --> 3231.50]  It's a great announcement.
[3232.02 --> 3232.84]  So let's read
[3232.84 --> 3233.64]  verse 13.
[3233.64 --> 3235.00]  The angel
[3235.00 --> 3235.80]  said to him,
[3236.00 --> 3236.64]  don't be afraid,
[3236.74 --> 3237.22]  Zechariah.
[3237.30 --> 3237.76]  Your prayer
[3237.76 --> 3238.52]  has been heard.
[3238.78 --> 3239.28]  Your wife,
[3239.38 --> 3239.82]  Elizabeth,
[3240.10 --> 3241.34]  will bear you a son.
[3241.60 --> 3242.72]  You are to call him
[3242.72 --> 3243.54]  John.
[3245.28 --> 3246.10]  The angel
[3246.10 --> 3247.02]  tells Zechariah
[3247.02 --> 3247.56]  that he is going
[3247.56 --> 3248.32]  to have a son,
[3248.46 --> 3249.58]  the very thing
[3249.58 --> 3250.54]  he has been
[3250.54 --> 3251.52]  hoping for
[3251.52 --> 3253.02]  and waiting for
[3253.02 --> 3254.20]  and praying for.
[3255.00 --> 3255.66]  And the name
[3255.66 --> 3256.20]  John,
[3256.30 --> 3256.80]  it means
[3256.80 --> 3257.60]  God has been
[3257.60 --> 3258.12]  gracious.
[3259.40 --> 3260.46]  God has answered
[3260.46 --> 3261.18]  Zechariah
[3261.18 --> 3262.14]  in Elizabeth's prayer
[3262.14 --> 3262.74]  for a child
[3262.74 --> 3263.94]  that is God's grace
[3263.94 --> 3264.48]  to them.
[3266.10 --> 3266.94]  So how
[3266.94 --> 3268.02]  does Zechariah
[3268.02 --> 3268.88]  respond?
[3269.40 --> 3270.14]  How does he respond?
[3270.26 --> 3270.72]  Let's look
[3270.72 --> 3271.46]  at verse 18.
[3273.04 --> 3273.54]  Zechariah
[3273.54 --> 3274.50]  asked the angel,
[3275.46 --> 3276.08]  how can I
[3276.08 --> 3277.16]  be sure of this?
[3277.28 --> 3278.44]  I am an old man
[3278.44 --> 3279.60]  and my wife
[3279.60 --> 3281.00]  is very old.
[3284.70 --> 3285.20]  Now,
[3285.32 --> 3286.08]  this ought to
[3286.08 --> 3286.66]  have been
[3286.66 --> 3288.14]  amazing news.
[3289.12 --> 3289.32]  Right?
[3289.38 --> 3289.66]  This might,
[3289.76 --> 3290.60]  this would have been
[3290.60 --> 3291.34]  the best news
[3291.34 --> 3291.98]  he's ever heard
[3291.98 --> 3292.58]  in his life.
[3293.44 --> 3293.92]  But,
[3294.26 --> 3294.98]  Zechariah
[3294.98 --> 3295.82]  struggles
[3295.82 --> 3297.44]  to believe
[3297.44 --> 3298.36]  the good news.
[3299.52 --> 3300.38]  And we know
[3300.38 --> 3301.12]  he's struggling
[3301.12 --> 3302.74]  to believe
[3302.74 --> 3303.60]  because of
[3303.60 --> 3304.90]  Gabriel's response
[3304.90 --> 3306.28]  in the next verse.
[3306.64 --> 3307.30]  Verse 19.
[3307.66 --> 3308.64]  The angel said to him,
[3309.64 --> 3310.16]  look man,
[3310.32 --> 3311.92]  I am Gabriel.
[3312.04 --> 3312.42]  Do you know
[3312.42 --> 3313.28]  who you're talking to?
[3313.36 --> 3314.34]  I'm like Jason Bourne
[3314.34 --> 3315.18]  of angels.
[3316.10 --> 3316.92]  I stand
[3316.92 --> 3317.70]  in the presence
[3317.70 --> 3318.38]  of God
[3318.38 --> 3318.94]  and I have been
[3318.94 --> 3319.64]  sent to you
[3319.64 --> 3321.46]  to speak to you
[3321.46 --> 3322.42]  to tell you
[3322.42 --> 3323.86]  this good news.
[3329.86 --> 3330.70]  And he keeps going.
[3332.18 --> 3332.94]  And he says,
[3333.02 --> 3333.44]  and now
[3333.44 --> 3334.72]  you will be silent,
[3334.98 --> 3336.08]  not able to speak
[3336.08 --> 3337.62]  until the day
[3337.62 --> 3338.14]  this happens
[3338.14 --> 3338.90]  because you did not
[3338.90 --> 3340.08]  believe my words.
[3340.20 --> 3340.42]  Right?
[3340.48 --> 3341.00]  It says right there.
[3341.08 --> 3341.76]  You did not believe
[3341.76 --> 3342.28]  my words,
[3342.38 --> 3343.70]  which will come true
[3343.70 --> 3344.66]  at their appointed time.
[3344.66 --> 3345.94]  So Zechariah
[3345.94 --> 3346.48]  is struggling
[3346.48 --> 3347.16]  to believe.
[3348.04 --> 3348.66]  And I think
[3348.66 --> 3349.18]  there is something
[3349.18 --> 3349.76]  quite amazing
[3349.76 --> 3350.34]  about that.
[3351.28 --> 3351.68]  Right?
[3351.74 --> 3352.14]  This thing
[3352.14 --> 3352.60]  that he has been
[3352.60 --> 3353.38]  waiting for,
[3353.86 --> 3354.60]  praying for,
[3354.94 --> 3355.78]  hoping for,
[3355.92 --> 3356.56]  an angel
[3356.56 --> 3357.98]  actually shows up.
[3358.54 --> 3359.38]  An angel
[3359.38 --> 3359.98]  of the Lord
[3359.98 --> 3360.56]  who stands
[3360.56 --> 3361.32]  in the very presence
[3361.32 --> 3361.88]  of God
[3361.88 --> 3362.74]  and he says,
[3362.84 --> 3362.98]  hey,
[3363.08 --> 3363.80]  good news.
[3364.50 --> 3365.58]  I'm here to tell you
[3365.58 --> 3366.24]  that God has answered
[3366.24 --> 3366.76]  your prayers
[3366.76 --> 3367.66]  and Zechariah is like,
[3367.70 --> 3368.16]  are you sure?
[3368.16 --> 3370.70]  He's like,
[3370.76 --> 3371.12]  I'm not,
[3371.26 --> 3372.02]  I don't know.
[3372.08 --> 3373.10]  I don't believe it.
[3375.22 --> 3376.40]  What is going on?
[3378.06 --> 3379.08]  I think there's a lot
[3379.08 --> 3380.10]  going on here
[3380.10 --> 3382.20]  and perhaps
[3382.20 --> 3383.48]  if we think about it,
[3383.62 --> 3384.34]  he struggles
[3384.34 --> 3385.38]  to believe the angel
[3385.38 --> 3386.94]  maybe for two reasons.
[3387.78 --> 3388.22]  First,
[3388.54 --> 3390.14]  I think he's gotten used
[3390.14 --> 3391.42]  to not having any hope.
[3392.84 --> 3393.32]  Right?
[3393.38 --> 3394.98]  He's just given up hope
[3394.98 --> 3396.44]  of ever having a child.
[3397.00 --> 3397.72]  He's waited.
[3397.72 --> 3398.60]  He's waited.
[3398.80 --> 3399.34]  He's waited.
[3400.06 --> 3401.24]  And you can wait
[3401.24 --> 3402.16]  for a while.
[3403.04 --> 3403.22]  Right?
[3403.26 --> 3404.52]  You can sustain hope
[3404.52 --> 3405.32]  for quite a while.
[3407.52 --> 3408.94]  But at a certain point
[3408.94 --> 3409.50]  in your life,
[3409.52 --> 3411.04]  you just have to give up hope.
[3411.78 --> 3412.78]  You have to give up
[3412.78 --> 3413.56]  that expectation
[3413.56 --> 3414.84]  because it's just
[3414.84 --> 3415.62]  sort of painful
[3415.62 --> 3416.50]  and burdensome
[3416.50 --> 3417.90]  to keep it up,
[3418.34 --> 3419.10]  to carry that.
[3419.76 --> 3419.98]  Right?
[3420.00 --> 3420.66]  You need to move on
[3420.66 --> 3421.30]  with your life.
[3422.34 --> 3423.76]  And I'm guessing
[3423.76 --> 3424.72]  that's what Zechariah
[3424.72 --> 3425.18]  had done.
[3425.26 --> 3425.68]  He's just,
[3425.80 --> 3426.72]  he'd already given up.
[3426.72 --> 3428.68]  And so when this promise
[3428.68 --> 3429.90]  and pronouncement comes,
[3430.52 --> 3432.62]  it's more than naturally
[3432.62 --> 3433.76]  he's able to accept
[3433.76 --> 3434.84]  even though it should
[3434.84 --> 3435.52]  be good news.
[3436.02 --> 3436.84]  He's probably like,
[3436.94 --> 3437.14]  you know,
[3437.18 --> 3438.74]  where were you in my 20s?
[3440.08 --> 3440.94]  Why now?
[3442.50 --> 3443.82]  And perhaps Zechariah,
[3443.96 --> 3445.16]  he didn't want to get
[3445.16 --> 3445.90]  his hopes up again.
[3446.62 --> 3447.26]  He didn't want them
[3447.26 --> 3448.74]  to be gotten up
[3448.74 --> 3449.88]  and then maybe dashed.
[3449.88 --> 3451.56]  Now,
[3451.66 --> 3453.02]  a second reason
[3453.02 --> 3454.12]  for this disbelief,
[3454.18 --> 3454.58]  I wonder,
[3454.72 --> 3455.22]  is maybe
[3455.22 --> 3457.24]  it's because he didn't
[3457.24 --> 3458.18]  have to do anything
[3458.18 --> 3459.04]  to receive it.
[3460.08 --> 3460.60]  You know,
[3460.62 --> 3461.28]  because sometimes
[3461.28 --> 3462.38]  it is easier
[3462.38 --> 3463.24]  to earn
[3463.24 --> 3464.98]  than it is to receive.
[3466.34 --> 3467.82]  I think if the angel
[3467.82 --> 3469.42]  had given Zechariah
[3469.42 --> 3470.62]  something to do,
[3470.78 --> 3472.00]  it would have been
[3472.00 --> 3473.10]  much easier for him.
[3473.86 --> 3474.30]  Right?
[3474.34 --> 3475.22]  If the angel appeared,
[3475.30 --> 3475.62]  he's like,
[3475.80 --> 3476.04]  you know,
[3476.08 --> 3476.32]  look,
[3476.40 --> 3477.38]  I know you want a child.
[3477.74 --> 3478.86]  Here's what you got to do.
[3478.86 --> 3480.30]  And then he gives him
[3480.30 --> 3481.22]  some great task
[3481.22 --> 3482.08]  to perform.
[3482.70 --> 3483.60]  I don't think Zechariah
[3483.60 --> 3484.50]  would have disbelieved that.
[3485.34 --> 3485.48]  Right?
[3485.52 --> 3486.10]  He would have been like,
[3486.16 --> 3486.32]  great,
[3486.40 --> 3487.18]  what do I have to do?
[3487.50 --> 3488.40]  I'm taking notes.
[3489.68 --> 3490.12]  Right?
[3490.20 --> 3491.70]  I'll climb a tallest mountain.
[3492.16 --> 3493.20]  I will go fast
[3493.20 --> 3493.88]  in the desert.
[3494.42 --> 3495.48]  Whatever you say.
[3496.90 --> 3498.38]  Because it is easier
[3498.38 --> 3499.54]  to earn
[3499.54 --> 3501.06]  than it is to receive.
[3503.14 --> 3504.00]  But instead,
[3504.14 --> 3504.66]  Zechariah,
[3504.74 --> 3506.32]  he just gets the news.
[3506.80 --> 3507.00]  Right?
[3507.06 --> 3507.60]  There's not even
[3507.60 --> 3508.84]  a request made of him.
[3509.86 --> 3510.92]  It's just the news.
[3511.02 --> 3512.26]  And it's harder
[3512.26 --> 3512.94]  to swallow.
[3514.54 --> 3515.42]  So Zechariah,
[3515.50 --> 3515.62]  no,
[3515.70 --> 3516.42]  he's not lost
[3516.42 --> 3517.22]  his faith in God.
[3517.30 --> 3518.28]  He's still a child
[3518.28 --> 3518.88]  of God.
[3519.88 --> 3521.08]  He's just struggling.
[3521.98 --> 3523.78]  And as any of us
[3523.78 --> 3524.94]  in his situation,
[3525.12 --> 3525.70]  understandably,
[3525.78 --> 3526.56]  might also struggle.
[3527.36 --> 3527.60]  Right?
[3527.66 --> 3528.76]  His heart has become
[3528.76 --> 3529.20]  empty.
[3529.50 --> 3530.14]  It's become
[3530.14 --> 3531.62]  maybe a little bitter.
[3532.16 --> 3533.00]  It's a little bit
[3533.00 --> 3534.28]  lost hope.
[3534.28 --> 3536.34]  And he's not ready
[3536.34 --> 3537.56]  for God to meet him
[3537.56 --> 3538.66]  in that place of longing.
[3539.86 --> 3540.80]  He's not ready
[3540.80 --> 3541.86]  to hear God's voice.
[3542.82 --> 3544.18]  But God is patient
[3544.18 --> 3544.94]  with Zechariah.
[3545.40 --> 3546.38]  And the promise
[3546.38 --> 3547.62]  is not taken away
[3547.62 --> 3548.12]  from him,
[3548.20 --> 3549.12]  but God is going
[3549.12 --> 3550.22]  to discipline him.
[3551.60 --> 3552.86]  It's not a punishment.
[3554.02 --> 3554.26]  Right?
[3554.26 --> 3555.60]  The discipline of God
[3555.60 --> 3556.20]  for us,
[3556.28 --> 3556.88]  his children,
[3557.32 --> 3558.24]  is never given
[3558.24 --> 3559.00]  in anger.
[3559.22 --> 3560.02]  It's never given
[3560.02 --> 3560.66]  in judgment.
[3561.10 --> 3561.96]  But it is given
[3561.96 --> 3562.64]  in love.
[3563.92 --> 3564.76]  And what is
[3564.76 --> 3565.58]  the discipline
[3565.58 --> 3567.14]  for Zechariah?
[3568.20 --> 3569.14]  The discipline
[3569.14 --> 3571.06]  is forced silence.
[3571.06 --> 3573.30]  Now, why?
[3573.60 --> 3574.86]  Why that discipline?
[3575.40 --> 3576.52]  It's so fitting
[3576.52 --> 3577.56]  because
[3577.56 --> 3578.70]  what was
[3578.70 --> 3579.50]  Zechariah's struggle?
[3580.58 --> 3581.12]  His struggle
[3581.12 --> 3581.74]  was he would not
[3581.74 --> 3582.26]  listen
[3582.26 --> 3583.76]  and believe
[3583.76 --> 3585.14]  when he heard.
[3586.18 --> 3586.52]  And so,
[3586.70 --> 3587.54]  this discipline
[3587.54 --> 3588.98]  of his heavenly father
[3588.98 --> 3590.14]  out of love
[3590.14 --> 3591.12]  is for him
[3591.12 --> 3591.98]  to be silent
[3591.98 --> 3593.70]  so that he will
[3593.70 --> 3595.14]  learn to listen
[3595.14 --> 3596.42]  to the voice
[3596.42 --> 3596.80]  of God.
[3599.64 --> 3600.20]  Zechariah
[3600.20 --> 3601.38]  is put into
[3601.38 --> 3602.76]  his own
[3602.76 --> 3604.42]  kind of season
[3604.42 --> 3604.88]  of Advent
[3604.88 --> 3607.42]  as he is forced
[3607.42 --> 3608.28]  to wait
[3608.28 --> 3609.30]  silently
[3609.30 --> 3610.92]  for God
[3610.92 --> 3611.66]  to work.
[3613.38 --> 3614.26]  And at the end
[3614.26 --> 3615.02]  of this Advent,
[3615.20 --> 3616.06]  there will be praise.
[3616.16 --> 3616.24]  Right?
[3616.30 --> 3616.86]  His heart
[3616.86 --> 3618.50]  will be changed
[3618.50 --> 3619.70]  by this process.
[3620.52 --> 3621.32]  He will burst
[3621.32 --> 3622.84]  out in song
[3622.84 --> 3624.14]  of praise
[3624.14 --> 3624.76]  to God
[3624.76 --> 3626.02]  later on
[3626.02 --> 3626.50]  in the chapter.
[3627.20 --> 3627.72]  And so,
[3627.78 --> 3628.52]  he's learning
[3628.52 --> 3629.90]  to trust God again.
[3630.20 --> 3631.34]  And perhaps
[3631.34 --> 3632.16]  the hard way.
[3633.08 --> 3633.80]  But God
[3633.80 --> 3634.28]  will keep
[3634.28 --> 3634.84]  his promise
[3634.84 --> 3635.60]  despite
[3635.60 --> 3636.90]  Zechariah's
[3636.90 --> 3637.76]  own unbelief.
[3637.94 --> 3638.52]  And that is
[3638.52 --> 3638.92]  good news
[3638.92 --> 3639.64]  for us as well
[3639.64 --> 3640.54]  because it is not
[3640.54 --> 3641.50]  the strength
[3641.50 --> 3642.36]  of our own faith,
[3642.42 --> 3643.10]  it's not the
[3643.10 --> 3644.30]  consistency
[3644.30 --> 3645.62]  of our own faith
[3645.62 --> 3646.94]  which makes
[3646.94 --> 3647.56]  God keep
[3647.56 --> 3648.00]  his promises
[3648.00 --> 3648.64]  to us.
[3649.46 --> 3649.56]  Right?
[3649.62 --> 3650.10]  God is not
[3650.10 --> 3650.62]  saying to us,
[3650.72 --> 3651.44]  if you believe,
[3651.54 --> 3652.60]  I will save you.
[3653.94 --> 3654.58]  What God
[3654.58 --> 3655.38]  is saying is,
[3655.38 --> 3657.06]  I will save you.
[3658.02 --> 3658.92]  So believe.
[3660.06 --> 3660.24]  Right?
[3660.32 --> 3661.32]  Believe that message
[3661.32 --> 3662.68]  that I will save you
[3662.68 --> 3663.26]  in Christ.
[3664.14 --> 3664.58]  Right?
[3664.62 --> 3665.34]  It's not the strength
[3665.34 --> 3665.88]  of our faith
[3665.88 --> 3666.68]  which saves us,
[3666.70 --> 3668.04]  it is the object
[3668.04 --> 3669.08]  of our faith.
[3669.46 --> 3670.66]  The dependability
[3670.66 --> 3671.30]  of the thing
[3671.30 --> 3671.72]  that we put
[3671.72 --> 3672.40]  our faith in.
[3672.76 --> 3673.18]  Right?
[3673.22 --> 3673.66]  That is what
[3673.66 --> 3674.14]  saves us.
[3674.18 --> 3674.48]  And so,
[3674.60 --> 3675.08]  God,
[3675.20 --> 3675.40]  friends,
[3675.46 --> 3676.76]  is dependable.
[3677.10 --> 3677.48]  That's what we
[3677.48 --> 3677.84]  learn here.
[3677.94 --> 3678.98]  God is dependable.
[3679.44 --> 3680.32]  God is faithful.
[3680.32 --> 3682.20]  And we know
[3682.20 --> 3683.06]  he cannot deny
[3683.06 --> 3683.60]  himself
[3683.60 --> 3684.90]  and that he is
[3684.90 --> 3685.28]  faithful,
[3685.66 --> 3686.40]  and so we know
[3686.40 --> 3687.54]  that he will
[3687.54 --> 3688.28]  keep his promises.
[3688.58 --> 3689.16]  We know that
[3689.16 --> 3690.06]  we will be saved.
[3691.84 --> 3692.48]  And so,
[3692.56 --> 3693.52]  even in our own
[3693.52 --> 3694.04]  struggle
[3694.04 --> 3695.52]  to believe
[3695.52 --> 3696.12]  sometimes,
[3696.30 --> 3696.86]  in our own
[3696.86 --> 3698.08]  momentary lapses
[3698.08 --> 3698.64]  of faith,
[3698.82 --> 3699.60]  maybe like Peter,
[3699.96 --> 3700.78]  like Zechariah,
[3702.24 --> 3703.20]  you know,
[3703.26 --> 3704.42]  we might receive
[3704.42 --> 3705.12]  temporary
[3705.12 --> 3705.94]  discipline
[3705.94 --> 3708.92]  for those lapses.
[3708.92 --> 3709.86]  It's not because
[3709.86 --> 3710.50]  God is angry
[3710.50 --> 3710.86]  at us
[3710.86 --> 3711.24]  or judging
[3711.24 --> 3711.52]  us.
[3711.70 --> 3712.46]  He wants us
[3712.46 --> 3713.08]  to trust him.
[3713.14 --> 3713.52]  He wants us
[3713.52 --> 3714.04]  to grow,
[3714.92 --> 3716.12]  to help us
[3716.12 --> 3716.52]  to place
[3716.52 --> 3717.02]  our trust
[3717.02 --> 3717.56]  in Christ.
[3718.76 --> 3719.02]  Okay,
[3719.08 --> 3719.88]  so we've talked
[3719.88 --> 3720.78]  about the place
[3720.78 --> 3721.40]  of preparation,
[3721.66 --> 3722.42]  those places
[3722.42 --> 3723.62]  of unmet desires
[3723.62 --> 3724.30]  and longings
[3724.30 --> 3725.06]  that we all have.
[3725.74 --> 3726.30]  We've talked
[3726.30 --> 3727.44]  about the path
[3727.44 --> 3728.06]  of preparation,
[3728.52 --> 3729.08]  the work
[3729.08 --> 3729.86]  of learning
[3729.86 --> 3731.26]  to trust in God,
[3731.34 --> 3732.16]  to receive him
[3732.16 --> 3733.10]  into those places.
[3734.16 --> 3735.02]  But now it's time
[3735.02 --> 3735.46]  to talk about
[3735.46 --> 3736.08]  the purpose.
[3736.80 --> 3736.96]  Okay,
[3736.98 --> 3737.68]  that's the last point,
[3737.74 --> 3738.20]  the purpose
[3738.20 --> 3738.94]  of preparation.
[3739.86 --> 3740.56]  You know,
[3740.58 --> 3740.96]  and we've been
[3740.96 --> 3741.84]  focusing on
[3741.84 --> 3742.80]  Zechariah here,
[3743.20 --> 3744.60]  but the good news
[3744.60 --> 3745.04]  is yes,
[3745.06 --> 3745.54]  that you're going
[3745.54 --> 3746.26]  to have a son.
[3747.94 --> 3748.94]  And so the question
[3748.94 --> 3750.12]  is who is this son?
[3750.32 --> 3751.88]  Who is the child
[3751.88 --> 3752.52]  that the angel
[3752.52 --> 3753.16]  is foretelling?
[3753.26 --> 3754.20]  Who will he be?
[3754.50 --> 3755.30]  What kind of person
[3755.30 --> 3757.48]  is this special child?
[3757.92 --> 3758.68]  So let's look at
[3758.68 --> 3759.62]  what the angel says
[3759.62 --> 3761.02]  beginning in verse 16.
[3761.02 --> 3763.66]  He will bring back
[3763.66 --> 3764.84]  many of the people
[3764.84 --> 3765.40]  of Israel
[3765.40 --> 3766.30]  to the Lord
[3766.30 --> 3767.20]  their God.
[3767.94 --> 3769.02]  And he will go on
[3769.02 --> 3769.88]  before the Lord
[3769.88 --> 3770.48]  in the spirit
[3770.48 --> 3771.70]  and power of Elijah
[3771.70 --> 3773.50]  to turn the hearts
[3773.50 --> 3774.14]  of the parents
[3774.14 --> 3774.90]  to their children
[3774.90 --> 3776.20]  and the disobedient
[3776.20 --> 3776.80]  to the wisdom
[3776.80 --> 3777.46]  of the righteous
[3777.46 --> 3779.76]  to make ready
[3779.76 --> 3781.06]  a people
[3781.06 --> 3782.00]  prepared
[3782.00 --> 3783.22]  for the Lord.
[3783.22 --> 3787.28]  So clearly,
[3787.68 --> 3788.54]  this is not
[3788.54 --> 3789.88]  any old birth announcement
[3789.88 --> 3790.72]  that this is not
[3790.72 --> 3791.82]  an ordinary child.
[3792.92 --> 3793.80]  And though he is
[3793.80 --> 3794.44]  the answer
[3794.44 --> 3795.44]  to Elizabeth
[3795.44 --> 3796.62]  and Zechariah's prayers,
[3797.50 --> 3798.46]  he will bring joy
[3798.46 --> 3798.84]  and delight
[3798.84 --> 3799.82]  to them personally.
[3800.64 --> 3801.46]  This child
[3801.46 --> 3803.38]  will actually be
[3803.38 --> 3804.66]  a prophet of God.
[3805.26 --> 3805.96]  He will have
[3805.96 --> 3806.50]  the spirit
[3806.50 --> 3807.24]  and power
[3807.24 --> 3808.30]  of Elijah
[3808.30 --> 3810.26]  is what Gabriel says.
[3810.26 --> 3811.66]  And so,
[3811.82 --> 3812.42]  if you remember,
[3812.56 --> 3813.34]  we read earlier
[3813.34 --> 3814.74]  in Zechariah chapter 4
[3814.74 --> 3816.32]  and those very words
[3816.32 --> 3817.40]  are echoed here
[3817.40 --> 3819.16]  in our passage in Luke.
[3819.88 --> 3821.34]  And after that prophecy
[3821.34 --> 3821.90]  in Malachi,
[3822.54 --> 3823.56]  which is the closing
[3823.56 --> 3824.50]  of the Old Testament,
[3825.20 --> 3826.04]  there is then
[3826.04 --> 3828.16]  400 years
[3828.16 --> 3830.06]  of silence from God.
[3831.02 --> 3832.88]  This long advent
[3832.88 --> 3833.72]  of waiting
[3833.72 --> 3834.58]  and anticipation
[3834.58 --> 3835.74]  and longing.
[3836.58 --> 3837.72]  And Zechariah's prophecy
[3837.72 --> 3838.62]  foretells
[3838.62 --> 3840.24]  that when the new
[3840.24 --> 3842.04]  new Elijah comes,
[3842.54 --> 3843.98]  the very next person
[3843.98 --> 3845.06]  to appear
[3845.06 --> 3846.80]  will be God himself.
[3848.20 --> 3849.62]  And when Malachi says,
[3849.74 --> 3851.42]  I will send you Elijah
[3851.42 --> 3852.40]  before the great
[3852.40 --> 3853.22]  day of the coming
[3853.22 --> 3853.76]  of the Lord,
[3854.18 --> 3855.42]  many of the Jews
[3855.42 --> 3856.14]  thought
[3856.14 --> 3857.80]  that was literal.
[3858.94 --> 3859.10]  Right?
[3859.18 --> 3859.38]  And so,
[3859.46 --> 3860.04]  if you remember
[3860.04 --> 3862.64]  back in 1 and 2 Kings,
[3862.80 --> 3863.92]  what happens to Elijah?
[3866.04 --> 3867.14]  Chariots of fire,
[3867.28 --> 3867.42]  right?
[3867.48 --> 3868.58]  They come swooping down.
[3869.06 --> 3870.08]  Elijah's carried up
[3870.08 --> 3870.60]  into heaven.
[3871.82 --> 3872.82]  He didn't die
[3872.82 --> 3873.56]  an earthly death.
[3874.18 --> 3875.40]  So many Jews thought,
[3875.56 --> 3875.80]  okay,
[3875.90 --> 3876.60]  that means
[3876.60 --> 3877.76]  he's coming back
[3877.76 --> 3878.30]  to earth.
[3878.48 --> 3879.30]  He's going to be
[3879.30 --> 3880.22]  riding in that chariot,
[3880.36 --> 3880.82]  swing low,
[3880.94 --> 3881.48]  sweet chariot,
[3881.64 --> 3882.56]  and he's going to come
[3882.56 --> 3883.78]  and here's Elijah again.
[3885.38 --> 3886.50]  And that's why
[3886.50 --> 3887.60]  when John the Baptist
[3887.60 --> 3888.62]  as an adult
[3888.62 --> 3889.66]  is asked,
[3889.80 --> 3890.64]  are you Elijah?
[3891.96 --> 3892.60]  They're like,
[3892.68 --> 3892.82]  you know,
[3892.86 --> 3893.30]  we're waiting for
[3893.30 --> 3893.96]  this guy to come.
[3894.48 --> 3895.40]  He says no
[3895.40 --> 3897.72]  because he is not
[3897.72 --> 3898.74]  literally Elijah.
[3898.84 --> 3899.28]  He's John.
[3900.02 --> 3901.32]  But he is
[3901.32 --> 3902.26]  the fulfillment
[3902.26 --> 3903.02]  of Elijah
[3903.02 --> 3905.02]  because he
[3905.02 --> 3906.08]  has the spirit
[3906.08 --> 3906.88]  and power
[3906.88 --> 3907.68]  of Elijah.
[3907.80 --> 3908.66]  He is the fulfillment
[3908.66 --> 3909.46]  of that prophecy.
[3909.98 --> 3910.78]  And he is going
[3910.78 --> 3911.48]  to do the work
[3911.48 --> 3912.06]  of Elijah
[3912.06 --> 3913.32]  on an even
[3913.32 --> 3914.14]  greater scale
[3914.14 --> 3915.20]  than Elijah ever did.
[3915.88 --> 3916.68]  And that work
[3916.68 --> 3917.48]  John is given
[3917.48 --> 3918.08]  to do
[3918.08 --> 3919.34]  is to make
[3919.34 --> 3920.18]  ready
[3920.18 --> 3920.90]  a people
[3920.90 --> 3921.50]  prepared
[3921.50 --> 3922.22]  for the Lord.
[3923.54 --> 3923.76]  Right?
[3923.82 --> 3925.42]  It was John the Baptist's
[3925.42 --> 3926.66]  unique role
[3926.66 --> 3927.80]  in redemptive history
[3927.80 --> 3929.24]  to be the forerunner
[3929.24 --> 3929.84]  of the Messiah.
[3930.48 --> 3930.70]  Right?
[3930.74 --> 3931.48]  To prepare
[3931.48 --> 3932.44]  people
[3932.44 --> 3933.58]  for the coming
[3933.58 --> 3934.34]  of Christ.
[3937.28 --> 3938.02]  And that,
[3938.16 --> 3938.28]  friends,
[3938.32 --> 3938.96]  is what we are
[3938.96 --> 3940.02]  preparing for as well
[3940.02 --> 3940.70]  in this season.
[3941.46 --> 3941.94]  Right?
[3941.98 --> 3942.52]  The one
[3942.52 --> 3943.34]  who comes
[3943.34 --> 3944.52]  to each of us
[3944.52 --> 3945.46]  in all of our
[3945.46 --> 3946.44]  places of longing
[3946.44 --> 3947.52]  and all those places
[3947.52 --> 3948.64]  of unmet desire
[3948.64 --> 3950.28]  is Christ.
[3950.28 --> 3950.40]  Christ.
[3951.10 --> 3952.28]  And he meets
[3952.28 --> 3953.34]  us in those places
[3953.34 --> 3954.42]  and he meets
[3954.42 --> 3955.06]  us not with the
[3955.06 --> 3955.72]  answer that we
[3955.72 --> 3956.44]  think and hope
[3956.44 --> 3956.82]  he's going to
[3956.82 --> 3957.54]  give us always,
[3957.92 --> 3958.84]  but he meets
[3958.84 --> 3959.30]  us there
[3959.30 --> 3960.32]  with himself.
[3961.68 --> 3962.74]  That's his answer.
[3963.50 --> 3964.34]  The great promise
[3964.34 --> 3965.06]  given to us
[3965.06 --> 3965.80]  in this text
[3965.80 --> 3966.74]  is not that
[3966.74 --> 3967.90]  God will give
[3967.90 --> 3969.16]  us the thing
[3969.16 --> 3970.04]  that we ask,
[3970.26 --> 3970.98]  but rather
[3970.98 --> 3971.66]  he will give
[3971.66 --> 3972.26]  us himself.
[3973.10 --> 3973.82]  God offers
[3973.82 --> 3974.86]  himself to us,
[3974.96 --> 3975.76]  which is a
[3975.76 --> 3976.32]  greater gift
[3976.32 --> 3976.86]  by far.
[3978.08 --> 3978.90]  It's a great
[3978.90 --> 3979.38]  gift of his
[3979.38 --> 3979.76]  grace.
[3980.28 --> 3982.16]  And our passage
[3982.16 --> 3983.44]  ends in verse 25
[3983.44 --> 3984.20]  with Elizabeth
[3984.20 --> 3985.08]  saying this,
[3985.18 --> 3985.82]  the Lord has
[3985.82 --> 3986.76]  done this
[3986.76 --> 3987.36]  for me
[3987.36 --> 3988.94]  and these days
[3988.94 --> 3989.56]  he has
[3989.56 --> 3990.72]  shown his
[3990.72 --> 3991.12]  favor
[3991.12 --> 3992.02]  and taken
[3992.02 --> 3992.82]  away my
[3992.82 --> 3993.34]  disgrace
[3993.34 --> 3993.82]  among the
[3993.82 --> 3994.16]  people.
[3996.04 --> 3996.82]  Remember
[3996.82 --> 3997.42]  for Elizabeth,
[3998.12 --> 3998.88]  she had this
[3998.88 --> 3999.34]  place of
[3999.34 --> 3999.80]  disgrace
[3999.80 --> 4000.64]  in her life,
[4001.42 --> 4002.46]  which for
[4002.46 --> 4003.32]  her was
[4003.32 --> 4003.86]  the shame
[4003.86 --> 4004.38]  of not
[4004.38 --> 4005.24]  having the
[4005.24 --> 4005.58]  joy of
[4005.58 --> 4005.88]  children,
[4006.38 --> 4006.92]  the shame
[4006.92 --> 4007.20]  of being
[4007.20 --> 4007.88]  cut off
[4007.88 --> 4008.70]  from God's
[4008.70 --> 4009.02]  story.
[4009.02 --> 4011.24]  and what
[4011.24 --> 4011.72]  Elizabeth
[4011.72 --> 4012.26]  could not
[4012.26 --> 4012.72]  have known
[4012.72 --> 4013.20]  then,
[4014.40 --> 4015.36]  but which
[4015.36 --> 4015.82]  we know
[4015.82 --> 4016.52]  now from
[4016.52 --> 4017.06]  our vantage
[4017.06 --> 4017.46]  point in
[4017.46 --> 4017.84]  history,
[4018.04 --> 4018.68]  is that
[4018.68 --> 4018.94]  this
[4018.94 --> 4019.70]  disgrace
[4019.70 --> 4020.44]  that she
[4020.44 --> 4021.58]  realized God
[4021.58 --> 4022.02]  was beginning
[4022.02 --> 4022.42]  to take
[4022.42 --> 4022.92]  away was
[4022.92 --> 4023.32]  going to
[4023.32 --> 4025.08]  be so
[4025.08 --> 4025.78]  much bigger
[4025.78 --> 4026.78]  than her
[4026.78 --> 4027.28]  personal
[4027.28 --> 4027.72]  disgrace.
[4028.56 --> 4029.34]  The bigger
[4029.34 --> 4030.40]  story was
[4030.40 --> 4031.04]  that Christ
[4031.04 --> 4031.58]  was the
[4031.58 --> 4031.94]  one who
[4031.94 --> 4032.42]  would come
[4032.42 --> 4033.16]  not just
[4033.16 --> 4033.50]  to take
[4033.50 --> 4034.40]  away her
[4034.40 --> 4034.88]  disgrace,
[4035.02 --> 4035.26]  but would
[4035.26 --> 4035.76]  take away
[4035.76 --> 4036.48]  the disgrace
[4036.48 --> 4037.00]  of the
[4037.00 --> 4037.32]  entire
[4037.32 --> 4037.76]  world.
[4038.56 --> 4039.28]  That this
[4039.28 --> 4039.64]  Christ
[4039.64 --> 4040.34]  would come
[4040.34 --> 4041.32]  to meet
[4041.32 --> 4042.10]  the needs
[4042.10 --> 4042.82]  and meet
[4042.82 --> 4043.70]  the sins
[4043.70 --> 4044.34]  and the
[4044.34 --> 4045.04]  longings
[4045.04 --> 4045.98]  of the
[4045.98 --> 4046.56]  entire
[4046.56 --> 4047.38]  world.
[4047.76 --> 4048.20]  To meet
[4048.20 --> 4048.90]  all of
[4048.90 --> 4049.40]  our unmet
[4049.40 --> 4049.88]  longings,
[4049.98 --> 4050.44]  all of
[4050.44 --> 4051.04]  our desires.
[4052.78 --> 4053.34]  So you see
[4053.34 --> 4053.76]  the purpose
[4053.76 --> 4054.44]  of preparation,
[4054.62 --> 4054.96]  the reason
[4054.96 --> 4055.62]  we observe
[4055.62 --> 4056.36]  this season
[4056.36 --> 4056.94]  of Advent,
[4057.80 --> 4058.18]  is so that
[4058.18 --> 4058.80]  each of us
[4058.80 --> 4059.84]  might receive
[4059.84 --> 4060.86]  Jesus into
[4060.86 --> 4061.58]  those places
[4061.58 --> 4062.04]  of longing
[4062.04 --> 4062.42]  that we
[4062.42 --> 4062.98]  all have.
[4064.34 --> 4065.18]  So that
[4065.18 --> 4066.42]  he then
[4066.42 --> 4067.08]  might fill
[4067.08 --> 4068.12]  us with
[4068.12 --> 4068.56]  himself.
[4070.78 --> 4071.46]  You know,
[4071.54 --> 4071.78]  Advent,
[4071.96 --> 4072.70]  this is a
[4072.70 --> 4073.32]  short
[4073.32 --> 4074.02]  four-week
[4074.02 --> 4074.48]  season,
[4075.16 --> 4076.60]  but in a
[4076.60 --> 4076.90]  sense,
[4077.00 --> 4077.40]  it really
[4077.40 --> 4078.26]  is all
[4078.26 --> 4078.70]  of the
[4078.70 --> 4078.98]  Christian
[4078.98 --> 4079.38]  life.
[4080.06 --> 4080.16]  Right?
[4080.22 --> 4080.84]  The entire
[4080.84 --> 4081.52]  life of a
[4081.52 --> 4081.98]  follower of
[4081.98 --> 4082.98]  Jesus is
[4082.98 --> 4083.56]  spent in
[4083.56 --> 4084.12]  the posture
[4084.12 --> 4085.04]  of Advent,
[4085.90 --> 4086.74]  of preparing
[4086.74 --> 4087.56]  for Jesus
[4087.56 --> 4088.04]  to come
[4088.04 --> 4088.68]  into every
[4088.68 --> 4089.54]  part of
[4089.54 --> 4090.36]  our lives,
[4090.98 --> 4092.02]  filling
[4092.02 --> 4092.48]  us,
[4092.60 --> 4093.14]  replacing
[4093.14 --> 4093.76]  all of
[4093.76 --> 4094.26]  the emptiness
[4094.26 --> 4094.78]  with his
[4094.78 --> 4095.14]  fullness,
[4095.54 --> 4095.92]  replacing
[4095.92 --> 4096.36]  all of
[4096.36 --> 4096.96]  our doubts
[4096.96 --> 4097.50]  and our
[4097.50 --> 4098.02]  fears
[4098.02 --> 4100.02]  and our
[4100.02 --> 4100.76]  disbelief
[4100.76 --> 4102.42]  with trust
[4102.42 --> 4102.80]  and with
[4102.80 --> 4103.22]  faith in
[4103.22 --> 4103.56]  him by
[4103.56 --> 4104.10]  his grace.
[4105.06 --> 4105.36]  And friends,
[4105.46 --> 4106.16]  we are also
[4106.16 --> 4106.60]  then given
[4106.60 --> 4107.08]  the same
[4107.08 --> 4107.68]  call,
[4108.40 --> 4108.72]  the same
[4108.72 --> 4109.46]  task as
[4109.46 --> 4109.78]  John the
[4109.78 --> 4110.08]  Baptist,
[4110.36 --> 4111.24]  to declare
[4111.24 --> 4112.02]  to the
[4112.02 --> 4113.64]  world that
[4113.64 --> 4114.86]  the deepest
[4114.86 --> 4115.74]  wounds and
[4115.74 --> 4116.34]  the deepest
[4116.34 --> 4116.98]  pains of
[4116.98 --> 4117.60]  all people,
[4118.32 --> 4119.40]  then and
[4119.40 --> 4120.22]  now and
[4120.22 --> 4120.46]  in the
[4120.46 --> 4120.84]  future,
[4120.84 --> 4122.54]  will and
[4122.54 --> 4122.94]  can be
[4122.94 --> 4124.30]  met in
[4124.30 --> 4124.54]  Jesus
[4124.54 --> 4124.98]  Christ.
[4126.48 --> 4127.14]  So let's
[4127.14 --> 4127.40]  pray.
[4129.64 --> 4130.42]  And I
[4130.42 --> 4131.00]  want to,
[4131.54 --> 4132.22]  like I
[4132.22 --> 4133.04]  like to do,
[4133.14 --> 4133.62]  to just give
[4133.62 --> 4134.14]  you a moment
[4134.14 --> 4135.14]  to respond
[4135.14 --> 4135.78]  to this
[4135.78 --> 4136.68]  passage and
[4136.68 --> 4137.88]  maybe whatever
[4137.88 --> 4138.42]  God is putting
[4138.42 --> 4138.70]  on your
[4138.70 --> 4139.12]  heart, I'll
[4139.12 --> 4139.36]  give you a
[4139.36 --> 4139.68]  moment of
[4139.68 --> 4140.38]  silence to
[4140.38 --> 4140.70]  pray,
[4141.38 --> 4141.84]  and then I'll
[4141.84 --> 4142.32]  close us in
[4142.32 --> 4142.52]  prayer.
[4142.52 --> 4142.64]  Amen.
[4142.64 --> 4142.70]  Amen.
[4142.70 --> 4142.76]  Amen.
[4142.76 --> 4143.10]  Amen.
[4143.10 --> 4143.20]  Amen.
[4143.20 --> 4143.26]  Amen.
[4143.26 --> 4143.70]  Amen.
[4143.70 --> 4144.70]  Amen.
[4144.70 --> 4144.76]  Amen.
[4144.76 --> 4145.14]  Amen.
[4145.14 --> 4145.26]  Amen.
[4145.26 --> 4145.76]  Amen.
[4145.76 --> 4146.70]  Amen.
[4146.70 --> 4146.76]  Amen.
[4146.76 --> 4147.10]  Amen.
[4147.10 --> 4147.14]  Amen.
[4147.14 --> 4147.24]  Amen.
[4147.24 --> 4147.70]  Amen.
[4147.70 --> 4147.76]  Amen.
[4147.76 --> 4147.78]  Amen.
[4147.78 --> 4150.82]  Amen.
[4150.84 --> 4151.28]  Amen.
[4156.92 --> 4157.64]  Our Heavenly
[4157.64 --> 4158.66]  Father, in this
[4158.66 --> 4160.32]  season of longing
[4160.32 --> 4161.18]  and anticipation,
[4162.14 --> 4163.10]  we ask for
[4163.10 --> 4163.64]  your grace.
[4164.48 --> 4165.18]  Help us,
[4165.32 --> 4165.56]  Lord, to
[4165.56 --> 4166.44]  wait upon you.
[4167.64 --> 4168.16]  Help us,
[4168.26 --> 4168.52]  Lord, to be
[4168.52 --> 4168.90]  patient.
[4170.16 --> 4170.74]  And as we
[4170.74 --> 4172.04]  prepare the way
[4172.04 --> 4172.98]  for your coming,
[4173.90 --> 4175.06]  we pray that you
[4175.06 --> 4175.72]  would give us
[4175.72 --> 4176.46]  eyes to see if
[4176.46 --> 4177.06]  there are any
[4177.06 --> 4177.58]  obstacles,
[4177.58 --> 4178.42]  if there are any
[4178.42 --> 4182.04]  places that have
[4182.04 --> 4182.68]  been placed in
[4182.68 --> 4183.10]  the way,
[4183.26 --> 4183.56]  whether, you
[4183.56 --> 4184.34]  know, tree limbs,
[4184.52 --> 4185.44]  perhaps a block
[4185.44 --> 4187.50]  or obscure or
[4187.50 --> 4188.78]  limit our experience
[4188.78 --> 4189.36]  of what you're
[4189.36 --> 4190.20]  wanting to do,
[4190.66 --> 4191.22]  what you're
[4191.22 --> 4192.28]  wanting to speak,
[4193.04 --> 4193.48]  how you're
[4193.48 --> 4194.22]  wanting to be
[4194.22 --> 4195.26]  heard by us
[4195.26 --> 4195.92]  in this season.
[4197.16 --> 4198.04]  Show us what
[4198.04 --> 4198.98]  those things are,
[4199.06 --> 4199.86]  and by your mercy
[4199.86 --> 4201.16]  and by your
[4201.16 --> 4201.90]  Spirit's work,
[4202.02 --> 4202.66]  remove them,
[4203.42 --> 4203.72]  and Lord,
[4203.78 --> 4204.48]  replace them with
[4204.48 --> 4204.76]  joy.
[4205.70 --> 4206.52]  Replace them with
[4206.52 --> 4207.10]  trust in you.
[4207.10 --> 4207.68]  We pray in
[4207.68 --> 4208.26]  Jesus' name
[4208.26 --> 4208.94]  and for his
[4208.94 --> 4209.22]  sake.
[4209.78 --> 4210.10]  Amen.
[4212.54 --> 4213.06]  All right,
[4213.08 --> 4213.74]  let's all stand
[4213.74 --> 4214.96]  and let's
[4214.96 --> 4215.90]  respond to
[4215.90 --> 4216.62]  God's word
[4216.62 --> 4217.32]  with song.
[4217.32 --> 4217.40]  Amen.
[4237.10 --> 4251.62]  My hope is built
[4251.62 --> 4254.68]  on nothingness
[4254.68 --> 4260.38]  than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[4260.38 --> 4261.96]  God's word
[4261.96 --> 4265.02]  I dare not trust
[4265.02 --> 4267.62]  the sweetest
[4267.62 --> 4269.02]  faith
[4269.02 --> 4272.86]  My holy trust
[4272.86 --> 4275.82]  in Jesus' name
[4275.82 --> 4278.56]  who's
[4278.56 --> 4282.06]  God.
[4282.06 --> 4283.52]  My hope is built
[4283.52 --> 4285.58]  of nothingness
[4287.48 --> 4288.88]  my hope is built
[4288.88 --> 4295.20]  And Jesus' blood and righteousness
[4296.20 --> 4302.00]  I dare not trust their sweetest faith
[4303.44 --> 4309.44]  But holy trust in Jesus' name
[4312.00 --> 4318.80]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4318.88 --> 4325.88]  Weakly strong in the Savior's love
[4325.88 --> 4337.88]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all
[4337.88 --> 4348.72]  When darkness seems to hide His face
[4348.72 --> 4355.72]  I rest on His unchanging grace
[4355.72 --> 4362.72]  In every high and stormy gale
[4362.72 --> 4369.72]  My anchor holds within the veil
[4369.72 --> 4377.72]  My anchor holds within the veil
[4377.72 --> 4387.72]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4387.72 --> 4394.72]  Weakly strong in the Savior's love
[4394.72 --> 4401.72]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all
[4401.72 --> 4408.72]  Lord of all
[4408.72 --> 4416.72]  When He shall come, He's trumpet's sound
[4416.72 --> 4423.72]  Only I dare in Him be found
[4423.72 --> 4431.72]  Rest in His righteousness alone
[4431.72 --> 4433.72]  Falling with His name
[4433.72 --> 4434.72]  For the Lord, Lord of all
[4434.72 --> 4438.72]  For the Lord, Lord of all
[4438.72 --> 4440.72]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4440.72 --> 4445.72]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4445.72 --> 4452.72]  Cornerstone, cornerstone, weakly strong
[4452.72 --> 4455.72]  In the Savior's love
[4455.72 --> 4462.72]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all
[4462.72 --> 4469.72]  Christ alone, Lord of all
[4469.72 --> 4472.72]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4472.72 --> 4477.72]  Christ alone, born of a stone
[4477.72 --> 4482.72]  Weakly strong in the Savior's love
[4482.72 --> 4484.72]  Sail's love
[4484.72 --> 4497.72]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all
[4497.72 --> 4513.72]  So we respond to God by returning to Him
[4513.72 --> 4516.72]  a portion of all that He gives to us
[4516.72 --> 4520.72]  And so each Sunday we have a designated offering
[4520.72 --> 4522.72]  aside from also our regular budget giving
[4522.72 --> 4525.72]  And so the designated offering for this week
[4525.72 --> 4528.72]  is our church's local ministries
[4528.72 --> 4530.72]  And also take the opportunity to remind you
[4530.72 --> 4533.72]  that next Sunday is when we ask you to turn in
[4533.72 --> 4536.72]  your faith promise giving forms
[4536.72 --> 4538.72]  So as the council we prepare a budget
[4538.72 --> 4540.72]  It helps us to know what people
[4540.72 --> 4543.72]  prayerfully are anticipating to be able to give
[4543.72 --> 4545.72]  And so please turn in those forms
[4545.72 --> 4547.72]  during our service next week
[4547.72 --> 4549.72]  So may I ask the deacons to come forward
[4549.72 --> 4551.72]  to collect the offering
[4555.72 --> 4557.72]  Or at the church notes
[4557.72 --> 4558.72]  If any of that 없ens you
[4558.72 --> 4559.72]  Some candert That I can be able to visit
[4559.72 --> 4563.72]  You should be able to have entity
[4563.72 --> 4564.72]  I can go into some contract
[4564.72 --> 4565.72]  A lot of them
[4565.72 --> 4566.72]  Just say they may benefit
[4566.72 --> 4567.72]  but it will not exist
[4567.72 --> 4568.72]  From a casa
[4568.72 --> 4569.72]  It actually works
[4569.72 --> 4570.72]  I can go into the � hacer
[4570.72 --> 4571.72]  To all the locations
[4571.72 --> 4573.72]  A small Прbs
[4573.72 --> 4574.72]  of importance
[4574.72 --> 4575.60]  Also
[4575.60 --> 4576.32]  Ye
[4576.32 --> 4577.72]  We're able to help
[4577.72 --> 4578.72]  To all the components
[4578.72 --> 4580.72]  Amen.
[4608.72 --> 4610.72]  Amen.
[4638.72 --> 4640.72]  Amen.
[4668.72 --> 4671.72]  All right, let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[4671.94 --> 4674.98]  I want to begin with this collet for the first Sunday in Advent,
[4675.18 --> 4679.74]  then I'll go into praying for the needs of our church and our community and world.
[4679.96 --> 4680.98]  So let's pray together.
[4682.30 --> 4684.30]  The collet for the first Sunday in Advent.
[4685.16 --> 4689.20]  Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness
[4689.20 --> 4692.04]  and to put on the armor of light.
[4692.48 --> 4696.74]  Now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son, Jesus Christ,
[4696.74 --> 4698.88]  came to visit us in great humility,
[4699.46 --> 4703.40]  that in the last day when he shall come again in his glorious majesty
[4703.40 --> 4705.62]  to judge both the living and the dead,
[4706.02 --> 4708.60]  we may rise to the life immortal.
[4709.32 --> 4712.00]  Through him who lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit,
[4712.14 --> 4714.44]  one God, now and forever. Amen.
[4715.80 --> 4717.96]  The Lord, salvation is from you.
[4718.90 --> 4720.16]  Salvation is from the Lord.
[4720.30 --> 4725.56]  From the very beginning to the very end of our relationship with you,
[4725.56 --> 4728.68]  it is entirely a gift of your sovereign might,
[4728.90 --> 4730.92]  of your immeasurable grace.
[4732.04 --> 4735.40]  What we can never accomplish for ourselves,
[4735.56 --> 4739.78]  what we could never merit in our own strength or striving.
[4740.48 --> 4741.80]  Jesus, you have accomplished.
[4742.68 --> 4744.64]  You have accomplished it once and for all,
[4744.70 --> 4746.22]  and we are extremely grateful.
[4746.22 --> 4749.54]  We needed forgiveness, O Lord,
[4749.62 --> 4751.64]  and through Jesus' death on the cross,
[4751.86 --> 4754.16]  you have forgiven us completely.
[4754.96 --> 4756.44]  And Lord, we thank you for that.
[4757.36 --> 4760.00]  And Father, because of Christ's death and resurrection,
[4760.26 --> 4762.94]  our suffering now has meaning,
[4763.52 --> 4766.50]  and our sorrow has limits.
[4767.06 --> 4769.22]  Our tears will be wiped away,
[4769.26 --> 4770.94]  and our pain will be redeemed.
[4770.94 --> 4774.16]  And Lord, we thank you for that as well.
[4774.82 --> 4778.72]  That the craziness of this world will not prevail,
[4779.50 --> 4780.80]  but Jesus will.
[4781.44 --> 4781.92]  Hallelujah.
[4783.56 --> 4787.38]  Father, what a glorious gospel we have.
[4788.18 --> 4791.08]  What a graceful God you are.
[4792.34 --> 4793.78]  And Lord, we say thank you.
[4795.54 --> 4798.68]  And Father, we pray for your kingdom as it goes out.
[4798.68 --> 4803.74]  We ask that you would grant to us a deep grasp
[4803.74 --> 4807.24]  that your throne, your kingdom, is permanent.
[4808.28 --> 4809.38]  And that as your children,
[4809.56 --> 4813.00]  we dwell safely and securely in you.
[4813.92 --> 4816.24]  Give that to us, we ask, O Lord.
[4817.48 --> 4821.34]  And Father, would that throne upon which you seat
[4821.34 --> 4825.24]  be known in every place in this world
[4825.24 --> 4828.12]  where there are unmet desires and longings.
[4828.12 --> 4830.86]  Every place where there is pain and suffering,
[4831.36 --> 4832.30]  would you reign?
[4832.86 --> 4835.14]  And would your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven?
[4835.84 --> 4839.12]  Father, we pray today for our own local church ministries.
[4839.36 --> 4841.32]  We pray for our church home.
[4842.08 --> 4844.32]  We thank you for the joy that we have
[4844.32 --> 4846.36]  being in the throng of your people
[4846.36 --> 4848.86]  in this community of Ladner CRC.
[4849.86 --> 4852.80]  And Lord, we want to make disciples of Jesus.
[4852.96 --> 4853.90]  That's why we're here.
[4853.90 --> 4857.36]  We want to grow in the wisdom and knowledge.
[4858.22 --> 4861.76]  We want to grow in the love and the holiness of our Savior.
[4863.00 --> 4868.22]  And so we ask that through the ministries that we have here,
[4868.28 --> 4870.06]  that you would do your work among us,
[4870.92 --> 4873.60]  conforming us to the image of your son Jesus.
[4873.60 --> 4878.74]  That we would not grow weary in doing good
[4878.74 --> 4882.02]  or hardened in unbelief.
[4882.46 --> 4884.26]  But Lord, would you increase our faith?
[4884.38 --> 4887.30]  Would you grow us and be active
[4887.30 --> 4889.76]  by your Holy Spirit,
[4890.40 --> 4892.40]  working in us and among us for your glory?
[4893.24 --> 4895.02]  And Father, as a people who live
[4895.02 --> 4898.96]  in between Jesus' arrival and his coming again,
[4898.96 --> 4900.22]  Lord, we have needs.
[4901.26 --> 4903.24]  So we remember before you this morning,
[4903.48 --> 4906.10]  Grace Koistra, who was in the hospital recently
[4906.10 --> 4909.22]  for a spell and going through many tests.
[4910.02 --> 4911.62]  But Lord, she's in her new home,
[4911.84 --> 4913.88]  but she's not settled there, Lord.
[4913.92 --> 4915.10]  And we ask that you would help her
[4915.10 --> 4918.24]  to feel more at home in the place
[4918.24 --> 4919.24]  that you have brought her now.
[4920.20 --> 4923.52]  Lord, we pray for Janet, Janet's son David,
[4923.64 --> 4925.60]  who is in Delta Hospital even right now
[4925.60 --> 4929.48]  with pneumonia that has taken a bad turn.
[4930.02 --> 4932.64]  Lord, would you show your grace to him,
[4932.80 --> 4937.26]  heal him, clear the bacteria from his body.
[4937.94 --> 4939.56]  And Lord, would you restore him to health.
[4939.80 --> 4942.78]  Lord, we pray that you'd be with the doctors
[4942.78 --> 4945.92]  and that your mighty hand would be at work upon him.
[4946.52 --> 4948.68]  And Lord, give comfort to Janet and to us all.
[4949.66 --> 4951.42]  Lord, we continue to lift up Don and Marion
[4951.42 --> 4954.04]  as they serve you in Greece.
[4954.04 --> 4956.34]  Would you sustain them in their work
[4956.34 --> 4958.36]  and would they be a blessing to the many people
[4958.36 --> 4959.52]  that they interact with.
[4961.00 --> 4966.30]  And Lord, we ask that you would help us
[4966.30 --> 4967.74]  to continue to wait upon you.
[4968.32 --> 4971.22]  Lord, there are many things that we have spoken
[4971.22 --> 4973.02]  and many things, Lord, unspoken.
[4973.64 --> 4977.10]  Some of them known to us only,
[4977.60 --> 4979.28]  but Lord, all of them known to you.
[4979.88 --> 4982.64]  And we remember our gracious God and Father
[4982.64 --> 4983.98]  that in the name of Jesus,
[4984.26 --> 4988.02]  we can ask and you will hear us.
[4988.60 --> 4992.02]  So now, Lord, we pray as your son taught us to pray
[4992.02 --> 4993.52]  in the time of his earthly ministry,
[4993.52 --> 4994.30]  saying together,
[4994.30 --> 4996.70]  Father, our Father who art in heaven,
[4997.36 --> 4998.64]  hallowed be thy name.
[4999.22 --> 5000.32]  Thy kingdom come,
[5000.60 --> 5001.58]  thy will be done
[5001.58 --> 5003.42]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[5004.10 --> 5006.24]  Give us this day our daily bread
[5006.24 --> 5008.50]  and forgive us our trespasses
[5008.50 --> 5011.82]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[5012.18 --> 5014.20]  And lead us not into temptation,
[5014.78 --> 5016.22]  but deliver us from evil.
[5016.72 --> 5018.08]  For thine is the kingdom
[5018.08 --> 5020.28]  and the power and the glory
[5020.28 --> 5022.18]  forever and ever.
[5022.18 --> 5023.06]  Amen.
[5025.20 --> 5026.12]  Let's stand
[5026.12 --> 5030.28]  and go with God's blessings upon us.
[5030.40 --> 5031.76]  I invite you to join us
[5031.76 --> 5033.10]  for a time of fellowship
[5033.10 --> 5035.02]  in the fellowship halls.
[5035.34 --> 5035.94]  Grab a coffee.
[5036.62 --> 5037.38]  Talk to someone
[5037.38 --> 5038.92]  maybe you don't know as well.
[5039.38 --> 5041.12]  Ask them what God is doing
[5041.12 --> 5042.14]  in their lives lately.
[5042.94 --> 5044.18]  Maybe have that kind of a conversation.
[5044.90 --> 5046.48]  Now I invite you to hold out your hands
[5046.48 --> 5047.58]  to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5048.48 --> 5049.94]  May the God of hope fill you
[5049.94 --> 5051.84]  with all joy and peace in believing
[5051.84 --> 5054.36]  so that you may abound in hope
[5054.36 --> 5055.22]  by the power
[5055.22 --> 5056.78]  and the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[5057.54 --> 5057.88]  Amen.
[5058.92 --> 5060.02]  Let's remain standing
[5060.02 --> 5060.52]  and we'll sing
[5060.52 --> 5061.86]  Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus.
[5061.86 --> 5062.14]  Amen.
