[279.24 → 280.24] Well, good morning.
[280.24 → 281.24] Good morning.
[281.24 → 285.24] And welcome to the Latin Christian Reformed Church this warm balmy day.
[285.24 → 286.24] Not quite.
[286.24 → 292.24] We gather here this morning to worship, indeed to celebrate the one true holy God.
[292.24 → 298.24] My name is Ryan Van Viet and I will help lead us in worship this morning along with Pastor Jason True, who will be bringing us God's word,
[298.24 → 306.24] and along with Paul Kemp and the rest of the wonderful music team, who will be helping sing God's praise this morning.
[306.24 → 311.24] So, just one announcement and that is next week we are having a soup and bun lunch.
[311.24 → 317.24] We've got a few sign-ups already, but we could use a couple more, so feel free to add your name to the list.
[317.24 → 320.24] Otherwise, just bring your appetite next week.
[320.24 → 325.24] Now, so we come to the meat and potatoes of our service this morning.
[325.24 → 330.24] So, I'd ask you to please stand as we hear God's call to worship.
[333.24 → 337.24] Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name.
[337.24 → 340.24] Worship the Lord in holy splendour.
[340.24 → 342.24] The voice of the Lord is over the waters.
[342.24 → 345.24] The glory of God thunders.
[345.24 → 348.24] The Lord over mighty waters.
[348.24 → 350.24] The voice of the Lord is powerful.
[350.24 → 353.24] The voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
[353.24 → 354.24] Let us pray.
[354.24 → 359.24] Heavenly Father, we struggle to put your greatness into words.
[359.24 → 363.24] For nothing in this world can compare to the holiness of your majesty.
[363.24 → 367.24] From darkness and nothingness, you created the heavens and the earth.
[367.24 → 374.24] And you gave breath and life to the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the wild animals that move along the ground.
[374.24 → 380.24] Your spirit of grace and love fills our hearts from the very moment we were conceived.
[380.24 → 383.24] We thank you, Lord, for the many blessings you have provided.
[383.24 → 387.24] And for the many opportunities we have to be a blessing to others.
[387.24 → 393.24] As you dwell with us, open our hands to receive your word.
[393.24 → 394.24] Amen.
[394.24 → 403.24] Grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and in love.
[403.24 → 406.24] As God has greeted us, so now let us greet our neighbour.
[406.24 → 408.24] Amen.
[408.24 → 413.24] I encourage you to thank you to feed our neighbours to our angel and the church.
[413.24 → 414.24] The neighbours and Christianity will take a little bit of joy to produce an angel.
[414.24 → 416.24] The hell?
[416.24 → 418.24] Ready or fall?
[418.24 → 419.34] Surprise.
[431.24 → 433.24] Honey, yes, may I ask you to ask you to ask you to thank painted so many subjects that I asked you to provide.
[433.24 → 447.20] What a wonderful buzz of fellowship among our group this morning.
[447.20 → 452.20] We'll continue some of the words that Ryan shared about God's holiness and sing together,
[453.08 → 462.12] Holy, Holy, Holy, which is a familiar hymn that highlights the fundamental characteristic of the Lord,
[462.12 → 468.82] and the God that we know is his holiness, which is different from who we are,
[468.98 → 477.62] but he draws us in by his grace, and we celebrate and sing with the angels around the throne, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[492.12 → 500.56] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[500.56 → 511.06] Letting in the world that NAO faze main
[511.06 → 517.88] Na week a long time
[517.88 → 519.34] Amen
[519.34 → 521.74] Oh our life
[521.74 → 522.88] Amen
[522.88 → 530.38] All His praise,
[533.68 → 539.38] Holy, Holy, Holy.
[540.38 → 545.10] All His saints now show you.
[545.70 → 546.56] a
[546.56 → 576.54] Thank you.
[576.56 → 589.04] Holy, holy, holy, Lord, I'm not standing.
[589.04 → 599.56] Holy, I'm not standing, Lord, I'm not standing.
[599.56 → 624.76] Holy, holy, Lord, I'm looking, there's no place I've ever been.

[902.78 → 910.32] Father, behold it, the waters beholding.
[910.32 → 919.16] Fire, sing holy, forever the Holy Father.
[919.58 → 923.54] And worship the Holy Father.
[923.90 → 927.54] And worship the Holy Father.
[940.32 → 957.32] Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[958.16 → 965.40] Cry out, sing holy, forever the Holy Father.
[965.40 → 972.04] Come and worship the Holy Lord
[972.04 → 978.38] Let's stand for our last song.
[978.54 → 980.52] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty.
[995.40 → 1001.18] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty.
[1001.18 → 1005.62] The King of creation.
[1005.62 → 1011.04] Give us the praise and praise.
[1011.04 → 1015.62] For the Lord's salvation.
[1015.62 → 1020.62] Give us the praise and praise.
[1020.62 → 1025.42] Brothers and sisters, the King.
[1025.42 → 1033.30] Children and admiration.
[1033.30 → 1036.80] Praise to the Lord, the Lord.
[1036.80 → 1043.64] For all praise is wondrous, we pray.
[1043.64 → 1053.32] Shall we do our praise, please, Lord, so gently sustain?
[1053.32 → 1062.32] Have you not seen all that is faithful as me?
[1062.32 → 1069.94] Sent by His gracious ordain.
[1069.94 → 1079.62] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty.
[1079.62 → 1090.62] Share in His goodness and mercy shall be a prayer in you.
[1090.62 → 1100.30] Father, the Almighty.
[1100.30 → 1102.30] God, the Almighty.
[1102.30 → 1103.30] God, the Almighty.
[1103.30 → 1107.30] God, the Almighty.
[1107.30 → 1121.12] World Ci mansion.
[1121.12 → 1121.62] God, the Almighty.
[1121.62 → 1121.98] Lord.
[1121.98 → 1123.98] Oh, the Almighty.
[1123.98 → 1127.62] Come and worship the Lord.
[1127.62 → 1133.76] Come and worship the Lord.
[1133.76 → 1138.18] For no one's for Patel denied.
[1138.86 → 1146.30] How the Holy Spirit did not give correctly.
[1146.30 → 1154.26] аже telling us about to relate.
[1154.26 → 1169.54] You may be seated. Thank you so much.
[1176.06 → 1179.48] Part one of our scripture reading this morning comes from Jonah chapter 4.
[1179.82 → 1183.94] We come to chapter 4 in the context of God showing mercy on Nineveh
[1183.94 → 1191.10] after their repentance. But to Jonah this seemed very wrong and he became angry.
[1191.76 → 1196.70] He prayed to the Lord, isn't this what I said Lord when I was still at home?
[1197.24 → 1202.90] That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and
[1202.90 → 1209.24] compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love. A God who relents from sending calamity.
[1210.00 → 1217.46] Now Lord, take away my life for it is better for me to die than to live. But the Lord replied,
[1218.06 → 1225.26] is it right for you to be angry? Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city.
[1225.92 → 1231.42] There he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[1231.42 → 1237.96] Then the Lord God provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give him shade on his head
[1237.96 → 1244.40] and to ease his discomfort. And Jonah was very happy about the plant. But at dawn the next day,
[1244.92 → 1252.72] God provided a worm which chewed the plant and it withered. When the sun rose, God provided a scorching
[1252.72 → 1259.94] east wind and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and he said,
[1260.36 → 1266.90] it would better, better for me to die than to live. But God again said to Jonah, is it right for you to be
[1266.90 → 1274.92] angry about the plant? It is, he said, and I am so angry. I wish I were dead. But the Lord said, you have
[1274.92 → 1280.22] been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend to it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight
[1280.22 → 1291.40] and died overnight. And I should not have concern for the great city of Nineveh in which more than
[1291.40 → 1297.44] 120,000 people who live there cannot tell their right hand from their left and also many animals.
[1298.74 → 1300.14] This is the word of the Lord.
[1302.62 → 1307.38] Well, now we know how Jonah feels about God's forgiveness. As we come to our time of confession,
[1307.38 → 1312.56] let us dig into our own sin and how we can approach God's mercy through Jesus Christ.
[1314.48 → 1318.24] Scriptures and the world offer us two very different ways of dealing with our sin.
[1319.24 → 1324.88] Earthly solutions tend to involve deflection, downplaying, or outright denial. You aren't the
[1324.88 → 1330.60] only one, so don't worry about it too much. So maybe you lost your temper, but the ends justify the
[1330.60 → 1335.78] means and you needed results now. You're just being assertive, and you wouldn't want people to walk all
[1335.78 → 1343.06] over you. You made up by doing what is right loads of other times. The world suggests good karma or
[1343.06 → 1348.74] maybe good vibes can offset the bad. Or maybe like Jonah, we should just run away from it all and start
[1348.74 → 1357.02] fresh. The Bible offers us something very different. It's sacrificial, it's honest, sometimes brutally so,
[1357.02 → 1363.62] and it's often self-reflective. We are all sinners. We have failed to live righteously.
[1364.42 → 1370.48] God invites us to confess our sins, not to inform him, not even as a precondition of forgiveness,
[1371.02 → 1376.70] but as a celebration of his unconditional grace, which we have a claim to in baptism.
[1377.50 → 1383.04] We should take this opportunity with joy and eagerness, so let us do so today by coming to him in prayer.
[1383.04 → 1392.06] Holy God, we come to you this morning in confession with broken hearts and outstretched hands. Like a
[1392.06 → 1398.64] festering wound that refuses to heal, our sin wreaks havoc on our souls. The world encourages us to make
[1398.64 → 1404.40] excuses or to stand on our own and deal with it, but healing can only come from you, O Lord.
[1405.12 → 1412.26] Our pardon is not earned, but freely given to all those who love you. We thank you, Lord, for this gift,
[1412.26 → 1418.52] and we come to you this morning in celebration of your goodness, your patience, and your abounding love.
[1419.42 → 1425.16] Our offering this morning is a broken and contrite heart. Turn us away from wickedness and help us to
[1425.16 → 1434.66] forgive those who would hurt us. Amen. Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other
[1434.66 → 1442.50] a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, God, I thank you that I am not like other
[1442.50 → 1451.22] people, robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even this tax collector. I fast twice a week and I give a tenth
[1451.22 → 1459.60] of all I get. But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but he beat his
[1459.60 → 1468.40] breast and said, God, have mercy on me, a sinner. I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went home
[1468.40 → 1475.04] justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and all those who
[1475.04 → 1484.50] humble themselves will be exalted. Lord, we need you. Please stand and let us sing of this together.
[1484.50 → 1514.48] Lord, I know, I know.
[1514.50 → 1519.62] now.
[1519.62 → 1519.92] I know.
[1520.10 → 1520.90] I know, but before God.
[1520.90 → 1523.06] God be with me.
[1524.06 → 1529.14] He has patience for you to know, and let us know.
[1532.12 → 1542.02] In above I begin, I can't make, J señor, but he passes for you to the Lord.
[1542.02 → 1548.18] Oh, I need you.
[1548.98 → 1555.02] Every hour I need you.
[1555.02 → 1561.18] My love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1562.40 → 1567.12] Oh, God, how I need you.
[1572.02 → 1578.22] The truth comes in, for grace is full.
[1578.22 → 1584.72] The grace is now, He is where you are.
[1585.64 → 1591.94] Even where you are, for I am free.
[1593.04 → 1598.12] Only death is Christ's King.
[1598.12 → 1605.12] Every hour, Lord, I am free.
[1606.32 → 1612.00] Only death is Christ's King.
[1612.00 → 1619.00] Oh, I need you.
[1620.20 → 1624.00] Oh, I need you.
[1624.00 → 1630.00] Every hour I need you.
[1630.00 → 1637.00] My love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1637.00 → 1639.00] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1639.00 → 1643.00] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1643.00 → 1645.00] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1645.00 → 1649.00] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1649.20 → 1651.20] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1651.20 → 1653.20] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1653.20 → 1657.20] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1657.40 → 1659.40] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1659.40 → 1661.40] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1661.40 → 1665.40] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1665.60 → 1667.60] All love and thanks, my righteousness.
[1667.60 → 1671.60] Jesus, Lord, I know I'll stay.
[1672.60 → 1677.60] And when I get a standoff for you,
[1677.60 → 1683.60] God is good and good and good and good.
[1686.60 → 1689.60] Lord, I need you.
[1689.60 → 1693.60] Oh, I need you.
[1693.60 → 1699.60] Every hour I need.
[1700.60 → 1703.60] Lord, I need you.
[1704.60 → 1707.60] My righteousness, my righteousness.
[1708.60 → 1712.60] Oh, God, how I need you.
[1712.60 → 1717.60] Oh, God, how I need you.
[1718.60 → 1720.60] Lord, I need you.
[1720.60 → 1725.60] Oh, I need you.
[1726.60 → 1731.60] Every hour I need you.
[1731.60 → 1738.60] My one great rest, my righteousness.
[1738.60 → 1744.60] Oh, God, how I need you.
[1745.60 → 1752.60] My one great rest, my righteousness.
[1752.60 → 1761.60] Oh, God, how I need you.
[1761.60 → 1768.60] My one great rest, my God.
[1768.60 → 1770.60] I love you.
[1771.60 → 1781.60] So the children are dismissed to go to their classes now.
[1781.60 → 1783.96] The children are dismissed to go to their classes now.
[1802.48 → 1803.62] All right, so good morning.
[1805.26 → 1806.66] It's good to be with you this morning.
[1806.82 → 1808.36] If I haven't met you, my name is Jason.
[1808.36 → 1813.18] And so we are going to turn to God's word.
[1813.90 → 1818.30] By way of orientation, we are in the season of Epiphany.
[1819.28 → 1823.38] And so having anticipated, remember, the coming of Jesus at Advent,
[1824.00 → 1828.26] and then having celebrated that Jesus has come during Christmas,
[1829.02 → 1836.54] now in the season of Epiphany, we behold the illumination of Jesus,
[1836.54 → 1840.88] his identity as our Saviour and our King.
[1841.18 → 1842.36] We look to Jesus.
[1843.22 → 1850.10] And Jesus, he reveals his identity to us in all manner of ways in his life and ministry.
[1850.70 → 1857.52] We see him revealing who he is through his teaching, through his miracles.
[1857.52 → 1862.38] And then as we are exploring in our, in this particular sermon series,
[1862.98 → 1869.64] he reveals who he is, and he reveals his mission through eating, through sharing meals.
[1870.78 → 1875.64] And then so, so far, we've seen first a table for sinners,
[1875.64 → 1879.06] where Jesus ate with a sinful woman,
[1880.16 → 1884.90] and who, you know, who bathed Jesus' feet with her tears of repentance,
[1885.40 → 1887.24] and Jesus offers her forgiveness.
[1888.34 → 1891.48] And then last week, we looked at a table for the many,
[1892.04 → 1895.40] where Jesus hosted a meal for 5,000 people
[1895.40 → 1899.94] out on the grassy hilltops north of the Sea of Galilee.
[1899.94 → 1904.90] And he revealed himself to be the bread of life.
[1905.34 → 1907.24] And if we remember, even though his disciples,
[1907.40 → 1910.56] they doubted that he could really provide all that was needed,
[1911.00 → 1915.68] Jesus invited them, included them in serving the crowd.
[1916.02 → 1917.20] And he does that with us as well.
[1918.28 → 1923.62] So today, we come to a table for the religious.
[1924.74 → 1928.86] And we see here Jesus eating with a bunch of religious leaders.
[1928.86 → 1930.60] So let's open our Bibles.
[1931.48 → 1934.72] And we are going to look this morning at Luke chapter 11.
[1934.84 → 1937.20] We are in the Gospel of Luke in this series.
[1937.64 → 1939.08] We're kind of going through.
[1939.68 → 1940.98] We're going to look at Luke 11.
[1941.88 → 1946.80] And that is on page 774 of your Pew Bible, page 774.
[1948.96 → 1952.96] Luke 11, and we're only going to read verses 37 to 44.
[1953.16 → 1955.94] I think in the bulletin I put 54, but we're going to cut it a bit short.
[1955.94 → 1960.86] So 37 to 44, let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[1961.16 → 1961.98] I'll read it for us.
[1963.04 → 1966.94] When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him.
[1967.52 → 1969.72] So he went in and reclined at the table.
[1970.50 → 1976.68] But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.
[1976.68 → 1979.38] Then the Lord said to him,
[1979.38 → 2009.06] Woe to you, Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue, and all other kinds of garden herbs.
[2009.06 → 2012.14] But you neglect justice and the love of God.
[2012.76 → 2016.16] You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
[2017.54 → 2024.70] Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogue and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
[2025.58 → 2032.46] Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.
[2033.96 → 2035.44] This is the word of the Lord.
[2036.24 → 2037.28] Thanks be to God.
[2037.70 → 2038.22] Let's pray.
[2038.22 → 2046.38] Our Lord, we thank you for your word, even when it's hard.
[2047.98 → 2050.76] And we ask that you would be our teacher this morning.
[2051.28 → 2055.44] We ask that you, by your word, would shape our hearts and that you would shape our lives.
[2056.32 → 2059.00] And we pray most of all, Lord, that you would show us Jesus.
[2060.04 → 2066.20] And that we would trust in him and that we would rest in him alone for our salvation and for all things.
[2066.20 → 2067.64] And it's in his name that we pray.
[2067.64 → 2068.60] Amen.
[2070.92 → 2081.40] Now, one of the things that we see throughout Jesus' ministry is that it is quite possible to have a religious life, right?
[2081.40 → 2085.82] A life that is full of church and religious devotion, even.
[2085.82 → 2092.38] And yet, a life that is nowhere near following Jesus.
[2092.38 → 2102.24] Jesus makes it pretty clear that following him and a religious life are actually two different things.
[2102.64 → 2107.20] Actually, they are opposite things, kind of opposite sides of a spectrum.
[2107.20 → 2116.58] And so, the way the Bible uses this word religion is generally a negative term, right?
[2116.62 → 2121.74] Because religion is basically a way of saying to God, I don't need you.
[2123.14 → 2126.62] Okay, religion is a way to say to God, I don't need you.
[2126.62 → 2135.08] And so, following Jesus and trusting in Jesus, believing in Jesus is actually something very different from religion.
[2136.08 → 2141.42] And so, what we're going to do as we look through this passage is we're just going to try to answer two things.
[2142.08 → 2145.58] First, what is a religious life?
[2146.56 → 2150.14] What does Jesus say about a religious life?
[2150.78 → 2153.82] And then secondly, how is following Jesus better?
[2153.82 → 2161.34] Right? And so, we're going to see Jesus' grace and Jesus' love also for religious people.
[2162.40 → 2163.86] And so, that's what we're going to look at.
[2163.92 → 2174.02] And in the process, hopefully, the Holy Spirit will be pointing to our hearts and showing us that trusting in Jesus is actually good news.
[2174.74 → 2178.34] But that religion is not good news.
[2179.24 → 2182.88] Okay, so first, what is a religious life?
[2182.88 → 2189.30] You know, and as we look at Jesus' interactions in the Gospels with all kinds of people,
[2189.62 → 2195.66] we find that Jesus quite rarely ever gets angry with people.
[2196.82 → 2197.04] Right?
[2197.08 → 2201.94] If you think about, you know, that meal that we talked about the first time, the meal with this sinful woman.
[2202.68 → 2202.98] Right?
[2203.04 → 2204.00] She comes in.
[2204.12 → 2205.68] She interrupts a dinner party.
[2205.68 → 2208.00] She causes a scene.
[2208.46 → 2210.12] And then she, you know, she cries.
[2210.26 → 2211.86] She's weeping over Jesus' feet.
[2211.94 → 2213.18] She lets down her hair.
[2213.48 → 2214.60] She's cleaning his feet.
[2214.70 → 2216.00] It's completely scandalous.
[2216.76 → 2218.92] And Jesus is not angry with her.
[2219.02 → 2220.96] You know, he is actually quite compassionate.
[2222.52 → 2228.02] And then all throughout the Gospels, you know, we see that there is this warmth to Jesus.
[2228.62 → 2229.38] There's a welcome.
[2229.86 → 2232.22] There's an inviting nature about him.
[2232.32 → 2234.82] He loves to be with all kinds of people.
[2236.44 → 2241.92] And, you know, of course, you know, when we see the marginalized, the poor, the weak, the blind, the lame,
[2242.00 → 2243.12] they come to him.
[2243.30 → 2244.76] They're attracted to him.
[2245.24 → 2246.30] And he is welcoming.
[2246.56 → 2247.38] He is compassionate.
[2247.38 → 2256.22] You know, then, you know, I even think, even so surprisingly, with Pontius Pilate, like Pontius Pilate is going to crucify Jesus.
[2257.46 → 2259.40] And Jesus just talks to him.
[2259.46 → 2260.48] He talks about truth.
[2261.06 → 2262.36] They have an exchange.
[2262.86 → 2263.06] Right?
[2263.12 → 2265.78] There's not this anger towards Pilate.
[2265.78 → 2278.16] But if there is one group of people that kind of stirs up some righteous wrath or anger in Jesus, it's religious people.
[2280.24 → 2281.78] Especially religious leaders.
[2281.78 → 2291.64] And so it's in his interactions with these religious leaders, the Pharisees often, that we see a lot of Jesus' real singers.
[2292.60 → 2295.42] Like, do you think you're going to escape the condemnation of hell?
[2295.56 → 2296.56] And stuff like that.
[2297.78 → 2300.40] And we see some of them in this passage this morning.
[2300.92 → 2301.04] Right?
[2301.10 → 2304.18] His sharpest words are for religious people.
[2304.66 → 2307.34] But that doesn't mean he doesn't love them.
[2307.34 → 2312.18] Okay, in this passage, we begin in verse 37, where it says,
[2313.42 → 2319.18] When Jesus had finished speaking, so he was doing some teaching, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him.
[2319.76 → 2322.58] So he went in and reclined a table.
[2323.42 → 2323.54] Right?
[2323.60 → 2326.40] And so the Pharisees, they are the religious leaders of the day.
[2327.18 → 2331.30] And they invite Jesus to come and have a meal at their house.
[2331.60 → 2336.06] And Jesus doesn't say, no way, I don't hang out with you guys.
[2336.54 → 2336.74] Right?
[2336.74 → 2336.98] No.
[2337.08 → 2337.94] He goes.
[2338.08 → 2339.34] He accepts the invitation.
[2340.36 → 2346.28] And in Jesus' day, having a meal with someone was a sign of fellowship.
[2346.74 → 2351.38] It was a sign where you're saying, like, I want to be in fellowship with you.
[2351.44 → 2353.32] I want to have a relationship with you.
[2354.48 → 2356.82] And so Jesus loves religious people, too.
[2357.50 → 2364.46] But part of his love is he's going to try to jar them out of the religious life.
[2364.46 → 2367.24] He's going to try to jar them awake.
[2367.24 → 2373.18] And that's why he uses this very sharp language that we read here.
[2374.02 → 2374.26] Okay?
[2374.38 → 2381.62] And so there's some structure here in the form of three woes that he gives to the Pharisees.
[2381.70 → 2385.32] And then he goes on to give three more woes to the teachers of the law.
[2385.40 → 2387.04] But we're not, you know, we don't have time for that.
[2387.12 → 2389.66] We're going to look at the first three woes to the Pharisees.
[2389.66 → 2400.36] And Jesus is stepping into what would have been recognizable in the first century as prophetic rebuke.
[2401.12 → 2401.68] Right?
[2401.74 → 2403.46] He's using prophetic language.
[2403.46 → 2411.58] And the people listening in that context would have heard and said, oh, Jesus is talking as if he's a prophet.
[2412.22 → 2413.12] That's what he's doing.
[2413.56 → 2417.34] So we're going to look at a few of these woes, these rebukes.
[2417.64 → 2421.60] And we're going to see what is Jesus after?
[2421.72 → 2426.48] What is he trying to jar them awake of as far as the religious life?
[2427.56 → 2427.80] Okay?
[2427.80 → 2432.40] So we're going to look at a few things about what the religious life is.
[2433.00 → 2436.86] And the goal here is to make you see how bad it is.
[2436.98 → 2437.14] Okay?
[2437.16 → 2437.84] So it's bad.
[2437.92 → 2438.62] It's kind of negative.
[2438.62 → 2446.02] So first, Jesus says that religion or the religious life is external.
[2446.76 → 2446.92] Okay?
[2446.94 → 2449.52] The religious life is purely external.
[2450.58 → 2451.82] So what's happening here?
[2451.92 → 2453.22] They're eating together.
[2453.98 → 2457.54] And Jesus didn't wash before the meal started.
[2458.46 → 2459.40] Kind of like my kids.
[2459.80 → 2460.34] No, they don't.
[2460.62 → 2463.14] But we say, you know, go wash your hands.
[2463.86 → 2466.56] Here, Jesus doesn't wash his hands.
[2466.86 → 2468.78] And it scandalizes the Pharisees.
[2468.86 → 2470.02] They are easily scandalized.
[2470.08 → 2471.30] But here, they're scandalized.
[2471.74 → 2477.22] But now, actually, what we have to understand is it's not like when I have to tell my kids to go wash their hands.
[2477.54 → 2479.46] It's not actually about hygiene.
[2480.32 → 2490.26] Jesus is not like, you know, this weird guest or this, you know, dirty kid who you invite to your house and everyone else is washing their hands, and he just won't do it.
[2490.46 → 2492.14] Like, that's not actually what's going on.
[2492.64 → 2493.76] It's not about hygiene.
[2493.76 → 2495.48] It's not about being sanitary.
[2496.18 → 2498.48] This is about being ritualistically clean.
[2499.60 → 2506.58] So before eating anything, a scrupulous Jew would have water poured over their hands.
[2506.62 → 2508.92] It's actually the word baptize to baptize.
[2508.92 → 2519.42] So they're kind of, they're ritually cleaning their hands and is to remove any defilement from their contact with a sinful world out there.
[2519.86 → 2522.98] So they kind of symbolically wash their hands clean.
[2523.54 → 2532.38] And all the Pharisees have gone through this ceremonial washing, signifying by this act that I am a clean person, and now I sit at this table.
[2533.46 → 2537.60] Everyone at the table needs to be clean and Jesus doesn't do it.
[2537.60 → 2539.58] But this is bothering them.
[2540.78 → 2542.80] They call Jesus out on it.
[2542.84 → 2546.20] And the text isn't clear if they said it or if he just kind of knew what they were thinking.
[2546.92 → 2550.20] But in a sense, he knows what they're thinking, or they said it.
[2550.40 → 2555.28] And he, in return, gives them a prophetic rebuke.
[2556.02 → 2558.32] So look at verse 39.
[2558.32 → 2570.08] Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
[2570.46 → 2575.64] You foolish people did not the one who made the outside make the inside also.
[2576.82 → 2582.82] And so Jesus uses this metaphorical image of a dirty dish or a dirty cup.
[2582.82 → 2589.06] You know, and sometimes we move recently into a new house, and we have a dishwasher.
[2589.24 → 2594.34] It's amazing because the last, like, 16 years of our lives we didn't have a dishwasher.
[2595.06 → 2596.44] We have a dishwasher now.
[2596.84 → 2597.76] But you know what?
[2597.76 → 2601.26] But it doesn't do as good as washing it yourself.
[2601.88 → 2606.46] So sometimes I go to unload the dishwasher, and I'm just kind of unloading.
[2606.56 → 2613.98] I'm putting the bowls away kind of quickly, stacking them up, not realizing that only, like, five out of the six are actually clean.
[2615.52 → 2621.68] But maybe one of them has the cereal from yesterday's meal kind of baked on to the inside.
[2622.24 → 2623.50] This is, it's not just me, right?
[2624.04 → 2625.40] You guys have this, right?
[2625.40 → 2625.84] Okay.
[2626.56 → 2631.36] And so we only discover that one of the bowls is dirty because you will hear one of the kids say,
[2631.84 → 2632.08] Ew!
[2632.68 → 2634.50] You know, wow, this one's dirty.
[2634.58 → 2635.62] Who did clean their bowl?
[2636.66 → 2637.90] So this is, this is how we know.
[2639.08 → 2645.56] So it looks clean on the outside when you get it out of the dishwasher, but actually it is dirty on the inside.
[2645.92 → 2646.12] Right?
[2646.14 → 2646.96] It didn't get clean.
[2646.96 → 2660.56] And so what Jesus is saying is that what God wants to do in our lives, the transformation that he wants to see in our lives, is not just the outward actions.
[2660.68 → 2666.26] It's not just on the outside and what people can see where it looks clean on the outside.
[2666.26 → 2669.38] But actually he wants to transform our hearts.
[2669.52 → 2671.52] He wants to clean the inside.
[2672.72 → 2678.10] But what religion, the religious life, is so concerned about is the outside.
[2678.82 → 2679.28] Right?
[2679.28 → 2687.08] And we are very good at hiding or keeping hidden many of the things that are actually happening in our heart.
[2688.08 → 2700.60] So if you think about your heart, my heart, if you think about the envy, the bitterness, you know, the maybe the judgmental spirit that we all have in our hearts.
[2700.60 → 2704.10] Every bitter, envious, judgmental thought.
[2704.60 → 2706.40] You know, how many of those actually come out?
[2707.62 → 2709.08] Maybe like one out of 50.
[2709.16 → 2709.62] I don't know.
[2710.16 → 2714.60] But, you know, we don't want those things to come out most of the time.
[2714.62 → 2716.96] Because, you know, if we did, we wouldn't have any friends.
[2717.98 → 2720.96] If everything that was in our hearts actually came out.
[2721.28 → 2726.90] So what we do is we spend most of our energy just trying to make sure that what is in our hearts stays hidden.
[2727.84 → 2730.54] Because, actually, that's a lot easier to deal with.
[2731.34 → 2734.52] Than actually dealing with what is inside our hearts.
[2737.46 → 2741.94] But God made you and me as a whole person.
[2742.56 → 2742.78] Right?
[2742.84 → 2743.76] He made your thoughts.
[2743.90 → 2744.80] He made your heart.
[2745.16 → 2746.10] Everything about you.
[2746.18 → 2747.80] And it's all made for his glory.
[2748.24 → 2755.36] And so part of the process of spiritual growth is to let Jesus clean the inside of the cup.
[2756.00 → 2761.34] To let Jesus do that work in our hearts to become truly clean on the inside.
[2762.78 → 2765.24] But religion is not interested in that.
[2765.40 → 2767.16] It just is concerned about the outside.
[2767.16 → 2772.44] It doesn't want to deal with the mess, the darkness of our hearts and our private lives.
[2773.12 → 2773.26] Okay.
[2773.28 → 2774.02] So that's the first.
[2774.26 → 2775.68] Religion is external.
[2776.76 → 2780.26] Second, a religious life is petty.
[2780.26 → 2780.50] Okay.
[2781.50 → 2785.34] And we can see that in verse 42.
[2785.56 → 2786.56] Religious life is petty.
[2787.00 → 2787.64] Verse 42.
[2788.42 → 2790.08] Woe to you Pharisees.
[2790.60 → 2796.12] Because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue, and all other kinds of garden herbs.
[2796.18 → 2798.36] But you neglect justice and love of God.
[2798.82 → 2801.78] You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
[2801.78 → 2802.18] Okay.
[2802.84 → 2804.82] So he's talking about tithing.
[2804.92 → 2808.86] Now tithing is something God commands in the Bible.
[2809.50 → 2810.82] So Leviticus 27.
[2811.26 → 2818.66] Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's.
[2820.08 → 2825.38] The tithe was meant to be a joyful offering of love to God.
[2825.60 → 2828.30] And it was then used to care for the poor.
[2828.30 → 2833.60] But the Pharisees, they were being very careful.
[2834.22 → 2837.24] You could even, you know, use the word persnickety.
[2837.80 → 2838.98] And I just wanted to say that.
[2839.20 → 2840.06] Because it's a great word.
[2840.36 → 2840.86] Persnickety.
[2841.08 → 2841.86] They're being persnickety.
[2842.46 → 2843.58] Very, very careful.
[2843.76 → 2848.20] They're following every letter of the law to make sure they get it just right.
[2849.08 → 2854.04] And Jesus is essentially saying, you're missing the forest for the trees.
[2854.32 → 2854.56] Right?
[2854.68 → 2856.46] The whole summary of the law is what?
[2856.46 → 2857.46] Love God.
[2857.68 → 2858.34] Love your neighbour.
[2858.80 → 2860.98] All life falls under those categories.
[2861.98 → 2867.40] And Jesus is saying to the Pharisees, you know, you're being very careful in your attention to detail.
[2867.40 → 2869.04] But you're missing the big picture.
[2869.66 → 2873.18] You're actually not loving God or your neighbour.
[2873.18 → 2878.06] And so, you know, you can see the Pharisees being very meticulous.
[2878.16 → 2878.96] They're in their garden.
[2879.54 → 2884.30] And, you know, they're cutting off a tenth of a piece of the mint and their spice rack.
[2884.44 → 2886.98] And they're going to bring these things to worship God.
[2886.98 → 2893.86] But they're neglecting justice for the poor and a sincere love of God.
[2895.16 → 2902.36] And so, a kind of what it is, is they don't know how to make judgments about what is central and important and what is petty.
[2902.46 → 2908.92] And they take petty things, and they elevate it to be most important.
[2908.92 → 2915.82] Now, some of us might hear this and think, yeah, that's right.
[2916.12 → 2920.16] You know, all of this doctrine that Christians are kind of very nitpicky about.
[2920.42 → 2921.78] Let's just get rid of all that.
[2921.86 → 2922.98] Just, you know, we need to love God.
[2923.04 → 2923.90] We need to love people.
[2924.08 → 2924.66] Keep it simple.
[2924.66 → 2927.82] But that's actually not what Jesus is saying we should do.
[2928.72 → 2928.96] Right?
[2929.06 → 2934.92] You'll notice he says you should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
[2936.12 → 2938.90] And so, Jesus, he wants us to care about God's word.
[2939.16 → 2941.42] He wants us to think about God's word.
[2941.74 → 2943.82] He wants us to obey God's word.
[2944.30 → 2950.44] But the problem with the religious life is not that it takes God's word too seriously.
[2950.44 → 2956.18] But rather, the problem is adding all of these other rules that go beyond what God says.
[2957.08 → 2961.02] And in this case, God didn't say anything about tithing your garden herbs.
[2961.38 → 2961.54] Right?
[2961.60 → 2962.72] It's just missing the point.
[2963.30 → 2964.50] And it's being petty.
[2965.52 → 2965.68] Okay?
[2965.74 → 2968.50] So, that's the religious life.
[2968.58 → 2971.08] You know, it's external and it's petty.
[2971.16 → 2973.82] It's making the smallest things of essential importance.
[2975.48 → 2977.54] So, are we painting a good picture yet?
[2977.72 → 2977.94] Right?
[2978.04 → 2978.88] The religious life.
[2978.88 → 2983.68] Third, a religious life is conceited.
[2985.50 → 2992.10] So, if you, you know, if you're simply all about cleaning the outside of the cup, not the inside,
[2992.76 → 3002.12] and if you are really thinking about, you know, I'm going to keep these little laws so that I'm doing it, and it's good,
[3002.12 → 3008.22] and, you know, you think about your spiritual life in terms of God loves me because I do these things.
[3008.62 → 3009.94] I'm being very meticulous.
[3010.04 → 3010.86] I'm being very petty.
[3010.86 → 3012.96] I've got to keep all these small rules.
[3012.96 → 3028.60] And it's a very different approach to your relationship to God where you say, God loves me because I'm good,
[3028.60 → 3035.48] compared to saying, wow, my sinful heart is a mess.
[3035.98 → 3038.56] And Jesus died for a sinner like me.
[3038.76 → 3042.02] God embraces me as a child, and I'm shocked.
[3042.20 → 3044.48] I'm surprised that God would love me.
[3045.48 → 3045.64] Right?
[3045.64 → 3048.86] That's a very different kind of life.
[3049.86 → 3052.54] These are two radically different views of God.
[3053.20 → 3058.78] In a religious life that only deals with the outside and says, I'm good, so God loves me,
[3058.86 → 3061.38] it will turn into a conceited life.
[3061.38 → 3067.28] And we see that in this next woe in verse 43.
[3068.40 → 3076.34] So Jesus says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important seats in the synagogues
[3076.34 → 3079.78] and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
[3080.78 → 3084.40] He's essentially saying you love status.
[3084.94 → 3085.46] Right?
[3085.52 → 3089.58] And it's this metaphor of having the best seats, the place of honour.
[3089.58 → 3092.40] And he talks about greetings in the marketplace.
[3092.64 → 3097.40] It's not like, you know, this morning we had a greeting and Ryan said, hey, let's turn and greet one another.
[3097.66 → 3098.96] And we're like, hey, how are you doing?
[3099.04 → 3099.60] How's your week?
[3100.26 → 3107.34] No, the greetings in the marketplace is the normal people who weren't Pharisees,
[3107.42 → 3110.16] who aren't keeping the law as meticulously,
[3110.70 → 3117.90] they would come to these religious leaders with this kind of very formal, very reverent, honouring kind of greeting.
[3117.90 → 3123.22] And so all of these petty laws that they're keeping, tithing their mint,
[3124.04 → 3127.90] gave them a sense of superiority over everyone else.
[3128.00 → 3134.24] And they loved it when everyone came and fed their sense of superiority in their conceit.
[3134.24 → 3140.14] Now, it's interesting, in the context of this text,
[3140.86 → 3143.96] in the verses that come right before the meal that Jesus is having,
[3144.66 → 3148.00] Jesus actually, he's talking about the prophet Jonah.
[3148.94 → 3152.82] Now, if you remember the story, you know what Jonah did.
[3153.70 → 3159.96] God calls him to preach a message of rebuke to the wicked city of Nineveh.
[3159.96 → 3163.92] Now, the Ninevite's are wicked.
[3164.66 → 3166.84] Like, objectively, they're wicked people.
[3167.00 → 3168.44] Everybody agrees they're terrible.
[3169.60 → 3172.24] And Jonah says, no, thanks.
[3172.64 → 3173.54] Not going to do it.
[3174.02 → 3176.88] He doesn't want to preach this prophetic rebuke.
[3177.16 → 3179.46] And it's not because he's scared.
[3180.16 → 3184.48] It's not because they're just so bad he doesn't want to be around them.
[3185.28 → 3188.72] Jonah does not want to go preach a prophetic rebuke to Nineveh
[3188.72 → 3190.82] because he knows what God is like.
[3191.48 → 3196.12] And he knows that if he goes, and he preaches, they might repent.
[3196.64 → 3198.56] And if they repent, what's going to happen?
[3199.64 → 3200.96] God is going to forgive them.
[3202.12 → 3207.18] And in chapter 4, you know, that we read earlier, that's what Jonah says.
[3207.18 → 3209.28] He says, that's why I didn't want to go,
[3209.38 → 3212.34] because I knew, God, that you were just going to forgive them.
[3212.34 → 3214.64] And I don't want you to do that.
[3215.76 → 3215.88] Right?
[3216.00 → 3218.24] Jonah is saying, I am a good religious person.
[3218.70 → 3223.26] And now you are giving your grace to people who haven't loved you,
[3223.58 → 3226.66] who haven't served you, who haven't kept the law,
[3227.00 → 3229.10] and you just want to go and give them grace.
[3230.88 → 3231.14] Right?
[3231.18 → 3232.78] That's Jonah's attitude about this,
[3232.82 → 3236.32] because he has a deep sense of superiority.
[3237.56 → 3239.68] He is a conceited religious person.
[3239.86 → 3240.84] That's who Jonah is.
[3240.84 → 3245.28] The people of Nineveh, they hear the prophetic rebuke,
[3245.34 → 3246.74] and they say, yes, we're sinners.
[3247.54 → 3248.80] We're sorry.
[3249.20 → 3251.02] Have mercy upon us.
[3251.78 → 3252.72] And God did.
[3253.66 → 3254.76] They get it.
[3255.20 → 3257.00] And that is what Jonah didn't get.
[3257.06 → 3258.92] And that's what religious people don't get.
[3260.00 → 3263.50] That's how, you know, religious people become conceited.
[3263.50 → 3268.68] Okay, so lastly, you know, we've looked at, you know, religious life.
[3268.80 → 3269.50] It's external.
[3269.94 → 3271.16] It's petty.
[3271.42 → 3272.46] It's conceited.
[3272.72 → 3277.06] And then lastly, Jesus shows us that a religious life is deadly.
[3277.86 → 3278.10] Okay?
[3278.22 → 3278.92] It's deadly.
[3278.98 → 3279.84] It leads to death.
[3280.44 → 3284.18] So here's Jesus' third woe to the Pharisees in verse 44.
[3284.18 → 3285.92] It says,
[3286.34 → 3290.52] Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves,
[3290.76 → 3293.90] which people walk over without knowing it.
[3295.14 → 3298.22] So what Jesus is saying here is that a religious person
[3298.22 → 3301.54] is like an unmarked grave that people walk over.
[3302.22 → 3305.56] Now, when a first century person would have heard that,
[3305.56 → 3310.50] what that would have meant to them is that you become ceremonially unclean
[3310.50 → 3314.20] if you put your foot on top of a deceased person's grave, right?
[3314.26 → 3317.62] Their uncleanliness of a dead body would kind of come onto you.
[3318.06 → 3320.82] That's why it's very important that you mark graves
[3320.82 → 3323.16] so that you don't accidentally walk on them.
[3324.00 → 3326.40] So what Jesus is saying to the Pharisees is,
[3327.40 → 3331.86] people are stepping on you, and they are becoming unclean.
[3332.56 → 3335.04] In other words, you are leading people astray
[3335.04 → 3337.32] and they don't even know it, right?
[3337.40 → 3340.38] Just because of their association with you.
[3341.92 → 3342.92] Ouch, right?
[3342.96 → 3344.96] That is a heavy rebuke.
[3345.88 → 3347.88] He's saying you are actually a hindrance
[3347.88 → 3351.64] to other people seeing the goodness and truth and beauty of God.
[3355.02 → 3356.62] You know, there's a quote,
[3357.22 → 3359.78] kind of very popular quote by Brennan Manning.
[3359.98 → 3361.82] Maybe some of you have heard it or read it somewhere,
[3362.22 → 3363.26] but it goes like this.
[3363.26 → 3367.76] The single greatest cause of atheism in the world today
[3367.76 → 3372.34] is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips
[3372.34 → 3375.64] and walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle.
[3376.40 → 3381.86] That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.
[3381.86 → 3386.46] It's also a harsh rebuke.
[3388.40 → 3391.96] So what Jesus says, what he's saying, what this quote is saying,
[3392.02 → 3393.86] is that it's our way of life.
[3394.36 → 3398.50] The way that it impedes or hinders other people
[3398.50 → 3401.38] from seeing the goodness and truth and beauty of Jesus,
[3401.88 → 3403.66] that really matters.
[3403.70 → 3404.38] That is important.
[3404.38 → 3408.36] And so any thoughtful reader, you and I, you know,
[3408.42 → 3410.30] we need to look at this text,
[3410.54 → 3412.56] and we need to immediately ask ourselves,
[3413.34 → 3418.90] what does my presence in the lives of other people point people to?
[3418.90 → 3419.90] Right?
[3420.94 → 3423.14] In other words, if I'm just hanging around with someone,
[3423.48 → 3425.48] what does my presence lead people to?
[3425.82 → 3427.78] Does your life, my life,
[3427.82 → 3431.84] does it point people to the beauty and goodness and truth of Jesus
[3431.84 → 3433.22] and his grace?
[3433.86 → 3436.24] Or are we like unmarked graves
[3436.24 → 3439.42] where we lead people astray?
[3439.42 → 3446.48] And so let's summarize then this rebuke that Jesus is giving to the Pharisees.
[3446.56 → 3449.46] He's saying a religious life is external, right?
[3449.50 → 3451.48] It's only focused on the outside of the cup.
[3452.42 → 3453.24] It's petty.
[3453.38 → 3456.76] It's missing the main point of love for God and love for others.
[3457.12 → 3460.24] It's conceited, looking down at people who don't follow all the rules.
[3460.38 → 3461.12] And it's deadly.
[3461.26 → 3464.14] It actually leads people away from Jesus.
[3464.14 → 3469.96] And so if you are feeling some kind of, you know, disgust
[3469.96 → 3472.74] in your heart for the religious life,
[3472.84 → 3474.38] that is Jesus' point.
[3475.24 → 3475.38] Okay?
[3475.52 → 3480.00] Jesus is showing them that this is what it means to be unclean.
[3480.72 → 3481.00] Right?
[3481.08 → 3483.38] Remember, this whole interaction began
[3483.38 → 3486.42] because Jesus didn't do the ritualistic washing thing.
[3487.08 → 3489.32] And the Pharisees, they are offended by that.
[3489.64 → 3491.78] And Jesus says, actually, you have no idea
[3491.78 → 3493.84] what it means to be unclean.
[3494.58 → 3495.78] Here's what it means.
[3496.58 → 3498.18] And he gives them this rebuke.
[3498.48 → 3501.90] And he's saying, you know, even though I didn't do this little ceremonial washing thing,
[3502.24 → 3504.74] actually, you are the ones who are dirty.
[3506.60 → 3508.00] And so this is an awful text.
[3508.90 → 3510.34] Where is the good news here?
[3511.30 → 3512.58] Please listen if you can.
[3514.08 → 3518.32] In order for us to understand what on earth Jesus is getting at here,
[3518.82 → 3521.46] we have to kind of pan the camera back.
[3521.46 → 3522.66] We need to kind of step back.
[3522.66 → 3529.92] And we need to understand the kind of vocation that Jesus is taking up with these prophetic words.
[3530.96 → 3534.40] Because our temptation, when we come to a text like this,
[3534.90 → 3536.62] is to kind of say, you know,
[3536.68 → 3541.66] Jesus is finally kind of unloading both barrels of the gun on those jerks.
[3542.36 → 3542.60] Right?
[3543.20 → 3545.52] You know, we kind of come to this, and we say,
[3545.52 → 3546.24] that's right.
[3546.78 → 3551.22] Jesus is on my side against those spiritual jerks out there.
[3552.76 → 3559.86] And yet, the most honest, self-aware, and appropriate way for us to read this text
[3559.86 → 3565.20] would be to understand that Jesus is actually giving a rebuke to you, the reader.
[3565.20 → 3572.70] Because, frighteningly, there is a religious person stirring in each one of us.
[3573.48 → 3573.72] Right?
[3573.78 → 3575.66] It's not some other religious person.
[3576.28 → 3577.32] This is us.
[3579.22 → 3582.18] But in order for us to hear that rebuke rightly,
[3582.60 → 3587.52] you have to understand this prophetic vocation that Jesus is taking up.
[3587.68 → 3590.88] Because you see, Jesus is the consummate prophet.
[3590.88 → 3596.22] All the other prophets of the Old Testament scriptures throughout the Bible
[3596.22 → 3601.80] point to and are a foreshadowing of the prophet that Jesus is.
[3602.40 → 3603.90] And who Jesus was.
[3605.14 → 3610.88] And the purpose of every prophetic rebuke throughout the entire counsel of God
[3610.88 → 3614.58] is not to condemn and to shame.
[3615.28 → 3615.88] But what?
[3615.96 → 3616.60] What is the purpose?
[3616.60 → 3623.82] It's to inspire repentance so that people then could turn and be forgiven.
[3625.38 → 3627.06] And so remember this dinner party, right?
[3627.12 → 3628.04] They're having this dinner party.
[3628.18 → 3631.62] Jesus, before, was teaching, and he talked about Jonah.
[3632.40 → 3634.66] And then this is what Jesus says in verse 32.
[3636.00 → 3636.78] He says,
[3636.78 → 3650.44] Now something greater than Jonah is here.
[3652.02 → 3656.38] Jesus in this text is showing that he is the true Jonah.
[3657.34 → 3661.24] Jonah was only a foreshadow of the prophet that Jesus is.
[3661.24 → 3664.88] Because Jesus is the one who comes, not just to Nineveh,
[3664.96 → 3667.74] but he comes to the whole world, this whole evil world,
[3668.10 → 3672.18] all of its wickedness, and he brings a rebuke to the world,
[3672.30 → 3673.90] and he does it in this text.
[3674.78 → 3680.28] And he does it not for the purpose of just kind of blasting the religious leaders,
[3680.50 → 3684.84] but actually to elicit repentance so that he can offer forgiveness.
[3684.84 → 3685.84] Right?
[3686.94 → 3690.52] Jesus' heart here is not to condemn religious people,
[3691.04 → 3694.62] but it's to jar us awake and lead us to repentance,
[3694.62 → 3697.82] where we see that Jesus' grace is better.
[3698.76 → 3702.20] Jesus' grace is so much better than this religious life
[3702.20 → 3707.26] that's focused on the outside and pettiness and being conceited
[3707.26 → 3709.26] and leading people away from God.
[3709.36 → 3711.48] Jesus is so much better than any of that.
[3711.48 → 3714.90] And that is the vocation of the prophet.
[3716.18 → 3719.48] And it's fascinating that Jesus, he goes on in this prophetic rebuke,
[3720.18 → 3721.40] and we didn't read it,
[3721.82 → 3724.78] but he goes on to talk about the blood of the prophets.
[3725.92 → 3729.50] And just as so many of those Old Testament prophets were killed
[3729.50 → 3732.10] because people didn't want to hear this rebuke,
[3732.94 → 3734.40] Jesus is about to be killed.
[3734.66 → 3736.26] They are going to put him to death as well.
[3737.16 → 3739.34] And he's going to shed his blood for whom?
[3739.34 → 3744.50] He's going to shed his blood for the very people that he is having dinner with.
[3745.68 → 3745.80] Right?
[3745.94 → 3752.92] And so on the cross, Jesus, who is the only perfectly pure, clean person who ever lived,
[3753.46 → 3757.74] Jesus is the only person who fully loved God, who practiced justice,
[3758.24 → 3761.38] he is going to the cross, he is going to take on the dirtiness,
[3761.74 → 3763.92] the uncleanliness of others.
[3763.92 → 3768.10] So that in his death, in the spilling of his blood,
[3768.42 → 3773.10] he can be the substitutionary sacrifice who can make us all clean.
[3774.68 → 3778.24] That is the good news for religious people like you and me.
[3778.92 → 3779.16] Right?
[3779.20 → 3780.40] We all want to be clean.
[3781.28 → 3781.42] Right?
[3781.48 → 3784.78] We're not just on the outside, but we want to be deeply clean on the inside.
[3784.78 → 3790.64] And Jesus is the only one who can make us clean and give us his cleanliness.
[3793.12 → 3797.10] And so friends, you know, when we think about being unmarked graves, right,
[3797.10 → 3800.06] when we think about maybe leading people astray,
[3800.34 → 3806.36] the best way that you and I can actually help others see the gospel,
[3806.90 → 3811.80] the best way that we cannot be a hindrance to others seeing the truth and goodness and beauty of Jesus,
[3811.80 → 3816.26] but actually to help them is by our repentance.
[3817.66 → 3817.88] Right?
[3817.96 → 3821.94] So for us, you know, as Christians, for us as a church,
[3822.74 → 3828.58] rather than being a group of people who are just so concerned about trying to clean ourselves up on the outside,
[3829.10 → 3834.78] but actually we become instead of people who actually recognize our uncleanliness,
[3835.18 → 3840.60] who admit it, and who turn to Jesus to make us clean.
[3840.60 → 3846.10] That is actually, it's our repentance that will lead people to know Jesus.
[3847.06 → 3848.74] Okay, so let me pray that God would help us.
[3852.12 → 3859.52] Heavenly Father, I pray that this morning you would give us the courage to hear these words of rebuke.
[3859.52 → 3868.58] Lord, it's so easy for us to maybe point the finger and see how other people are too religious.
[3869.28 → 3870.98] But Lord, we can be the same way.
[3871.82 → 3873.38] We can be conceited.
[3874.58 → 3876.94] Because we're not religious like other people.
[3876.94 → 3882.66] We can have this religious life in us too.
[3882.78 → 3888.20] And so Lord, would you help us to hear afresh these words of mercy and grace
[3888.20 → 3895.30] so that we might repent and receive the grace of our Lord Jesus and be truly cleansed.
[3895.94 → 3897.18] It's in your name we pray.
[3897.48 → 3897.76] Amen.
[3897.76 → 3897.86] Amen.
[3897.86 → 3920.00] Amen.
