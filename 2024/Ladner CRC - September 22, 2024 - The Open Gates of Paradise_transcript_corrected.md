[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 269.98] Amen.
[269.98 → 270.98] Amen.
[270.98 → 274.20] My name is Ryan, and I'd like to welcome you this morning to Ladder Christian Reformed Church
[274.20 → 275.80] on this Sunday.
[275.80 → 280.36] What a blessing it is to gather together as a community of believers to worship our holy
[280.36 → 281.46] God.
[281.46 → 285.82] If you are new here or visiting, I'd like to extend a special welcome and an invitation
[285.82 → 290.78] to join us after the service for coffee and fellowship in the hall at the back of the church.
[290.78 → 294.80] We'd love to get to know you better, so please join us.
[294.80 → 299.96] So right after the service, we've got a brief meeting for Sunday school teachers and assistance
[299.96 → 301.90] and volunteers with that ministry.
[302.24 → 305.68] That'll be happening in the council room, so if you're in that ministry and able to join
[305.68 → 307.04] it, that would be great.
[307.58 → 311.24] And we've got cross-training brochures available in the FOIA as well.
[311.36 → 315.74] So cross-training, for those who don't know, it's sort of a, I guess, a pre-service Bible
[315.74 → 316.10] study.
[316.40 → 320.84] And if you want a better explanation than that, there are brochures for you and sign up as
[320.84 → 321.00] well.
[321.00 → 322.92] So check that out if you're interested.
[324.72 → 328.58] So now let us turn our hearts and minds to the worship of our Creator.
[328.74 → 331.76] Please stand and join me in a call to worship from Psalm 103.
[331.76 → 332.76] Psalm 103.
[336.04 → 338.12] Praise the Lord, my soul.
[338.70 → 340.50] All my evil's need.
[340.88 → 342.48] Praise his holy name.
[343.30 → 346.80] Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
[347.44 → 351.88] For he is all his sins, and he is all his diseases.
[352.60 → 355.18] Who redeems your life from the pit.
[356.04 → 358.76] And grounds you with love and compassion.
[358.76 → 363.56] Who satisfies your desires with good things.
[364.18 → 368.88] Let us pray.
[369.82 → 376.26] Heavenly Father, our work, our hobbies, our families, our communities, our church, our
[376.26 → 380.54] world, our love for one another, these are gifts from you.
[381.30 → 383.78] For apart from you, there is no good thing.
[383.78 → 389.16] Your glory shines from the icy crags of our mountains to the murky deep of our ocean.
[389.70 → 392.58] From our mighty rivers, you feed and water the land.
[393.22 → 396.00] Give us abundant harvests year after year.
[396.82 → 403.42] The simplest things, like this morning's sunrise, is in fact a wonder, an awesome wonder, beyond
[403.42 → 404.22] our comprehension.
[405.04 → 408.02] It is a reminder of your power and your goodness to us.
[408.70 → 412.24] Your presence here fills us with glad tidings and your peace.
[412.24 → 417.78] We thank you for these gifts and indeed glorify you in the name of Jesus and by the power of
[417.78 → 418.52] the Holy Spirit.
[419.16 → 419.48] Amen.
[421.38 → 424.38] Our God has called us to worship and now greets us.
[424.94 → 429.64] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[429.92 → 432.34] From the seven spirits who are before his throne.
[432.72 → 438.02] And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the
[438.02 → 439.16] kings of the earth.
[439.16 → 444.38] Let us take a moment now to greet one another, our pew neighbours, before joyfully singing together
[444.38 → 444.78] in song.
[444.78 → 455.12] The then
[455.20 → 471.96] the
[471.96 → 501.94] Thank you.
[501.96 → 531.94] Thank you.
[531.96 → 533.96] Thank you.
[561.96 → 563.96] Thank you.
[591.96 → 601.54] May I raise my heaven's word, in the night I have my phone.
[601.54 → 610.44] And I hope by my good pleasure, safely to our I'm at home.
[610.44 → 619.74] Jesus, Lord, be when a stranger, my brings from the flood of God.
[620.24 → 628.52] He to rescue me from danger, interposed his precious blood.
[628.52 → 658.52] 
[658.52 → 662.48] Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it.
[662.86 → 666.52] Seal it for thy courts I buy.
[666.52 → 668.52] Amen.
[668.52 → 669.52] Amen.
[669.52 → 670.52] Amen.
[670.52 → 671.52] Amen.
[671.52 → 672.52] Amen.
[672.52 → 673.52] Amen.
[673.52 → 674.52] Amen.
[674.52 → 675.52] Amen.
[675.52 → 677.52] Amen.
[677.52 → 679.52] Amen.
[679.52 → 681.52] Amen.
[681.52 → 683.52] Amen.
[683.52 → 684.52] Amen.
[684.52 → 685.52] Amen.
[685.52 → 687.52] Amen.
[687.52 → 688.52] Amen.
[688.52 → 690.52] Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
[690.52 → 699.44] Glow in majesty, let all the earth rejoice, let all the earth rejoice.
[699.44 → 714.50] He wraps himself in light, and darkness dries to hide, and trembles at his voice, and trembles at his voice.
[714.50 → 732.66] How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will sing, how great, how great is our God.
[732.66 → 748.66] For me to wait, she stands, and time is in his hands, beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
[748.66 → 762.66] With God, with three in one, Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
[762.66 → 780.66] How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and always sing, how great, how great is our God.
[780.66 → 799.66] Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[799.66 → 819.44] Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[819.44 → 849.42] Name above all names, worthy of all praise, and always sing, how great is our God.
[849.42 → 852.42] Love with our God.
[852.42 → 856.42] Love with our God.
[856.42 → 859.42] Love with our God.
[867.42 → 868.70] You may be seated.
[869.42 → 876.56] Our first reading this morning is from Psalm 98, so you can find that on page 447 in your pew Bibles,
[876.56 → 879.56] and of course it's up on the screen above as well.
[879.56 → 884.56] Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvellous things.
[884.56 → 888.56] His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
[888.56 → 894.56] The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
[894.56 → 897.56] He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel.
[897.56 → 902.56] All the ends of the earth have seen salvation of our God.
[902.56 → 905.56] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[905.56 → 907.56] Burst into jubilant song with music.
[907.56 → 916.56] Make music to the Lord with harp, with the harp and the sound of singing, with trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn.
[916.56 → 918.56] Shout for joy before the Lord, the King.
[918.56 → 923.56] Let the sea resound and everything in it, the world and all who live in it.
[923.56 → 928.56] Let the rivers clap their hands and let the mountains sing together for joy.
[928.56 → 932.56] Let them sing before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
[932.56 → 937.56] He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.
[937.56 → 938.56] This is the word of the Lord.
[938.56 → 944.56] Thanks be to God.
[944.56 → 952.56] This morning as we come before God to confess our sins, we should remind ourselves that he does not need our confession.
[952.56 → 959.56] And it is not some cosmic barter system with God where if we say we're sorry, only then will he forgive.
[959.56 → 966.56] Confession is a gift, even more precious than all the things we prayed about already.
[966.56 → 968.56] It's a gift.
[968.56 → 974.56] Forgiveness is freely given and paid for in full 2,000 years ago on the cross.
[974.56 → 985.56] Therefore, we can be honest and open with God, knowing that he will not hold back mercy, but instead delights in our sincere and contrite hearts.
[985.56 → 989.56] As we read in Isaiah 29, the Lord says,
[989.56 → 995.56] These people come near to me with their mouth and honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
[995.56 → 1000.56] Their worship of me is based merely on human rules that have been taught.
[1000.56 → 1005.56] Therefore, once more, I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder.
[1005.56 → 1008.56] The wisdom of the wise will perish.
[1008.56 → 1012.56] The intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.
[1012.56 → 1019.56] Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the Lord, who do their work in darkness and think,
[1019.56 → 1021.56] Who will see us?
[1021.56 → 1022.56] Who will know?
[1022.56 → 1028.56] You will turn these things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay.
[1028.56 → 1032.56] Shall what is formed say to one who formed it,
[1032.56 → 1033.56] You did not make me.
[1033.56 → 1036.56] Can the pot say to the potter,
[1036.56 → 1037.56] You know nothing?
[1037.56 → 1039.56] Let us pray.
[1039.56 → 1044.56] Heavenly Father, you search us and you know us.
[1044.56 → 1049.56] You know our doubts and our fears, our longings and our desires.
[1049.56 → 1052.56] And yes, Lord, our sins and our iniquities.
[1052.56 → 1056.56] This morning, we bring them all before you.
[1056.56 → 1062.56] Change us, Lord, and help us to desire your will above all things.
[1062.56 → 1065.56] Free us from sin and mould us in your image.
[1065.56 → 1068.56] May we come before you with sincerity.
[1068.56 → 1072.56] Your grace and mercy is a gift to us.
[1072.56 → 1076.56] May we receive it with open hands and share it throughout our community.
[1076.56 → 1078.56] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1078.56 → 1079.56] Amen.
[1079.56 → 1083.56] So let us sing together the first two verses of,
[1083.56 → 1085.56] In You, Lord, I am found.
[1085.56 → 1087.56] And then we will continue with the rest of Isaiah 29.
[1087.56 → 1088.56] In Isaiah 29.
[1088.56 → 1089.56] Amen.
[1089.56 → 1090.56] Amen.
[1090.56 → 1091.56] Amen.
[1091.56 → 1093.56] Amen.
[1093.56 → 1095.56] Amen.
[1095.56 → 1097.56] Amen.
[1097.56 → 1098.56] Amen.
[1098.56 → 1099.56] Amen.
[1099.56 → 1100.56] Amen.
[1100.56 → 1101.56] Amen.
[1101.56 → 1102.56] Amen.
[1102.56 → 1103.56] Amen.
[1103.56 → 1104.56] Amen.
[1104.56 → 1105.56] Amen.
[1105.56 → 1106.56] Amen.
[1106.56 → 1107.56] Amen.
[1107.56 → 1108.56] Amen.
[1108.56 → 1109.56] Amen.
[1109.56 → 1111.56] Amen.
[1111.56 → 1112.56] Amen.
[1112.56 → 1115.44] Amen.
[1115.44 → 1116.56] Amen.
[1116.56 → 1124.98] Oh Lord, you know me and search me out
[1124.98 → 1129.82] My habits and thoughts, my secret doubts
[1129.82 → 1134.58] My dreams and thoughts, the words of my mouth
[1134.58 → 1138.36] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1138.36 → 1143.68] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1143.68 → 1155.30] I know not all my own heart and mind
[1155.30 → 1159.98] My wandering soul, my sleepless eyes
[1159.98 → 1164.60] I long for you, but from you, I hide
[1164.60 → 1168.32] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1168.32 → 1173.48] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1173.48 → 1185.16] Directly following, we read
[1185.16 → 1189.26] In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field
[1189.26 → 1191.96] And the fertile field seem like a forest?
[1192.74 → 1195.26] In the day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll
[1195.26 → 1199.70] And our gloom and darkness and the eyes of the blind will see
[1199.70 → 1202.86] Once more the humble will rejoice in the Lord
[1202.86 → 1205.62] And the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel
[1205.62 → 1209.16] The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear
[1209.16 → 1212.46] And all who have an eye for evil will be cut down
[1212.46 → 1215.96] Those with a word will make some out to be guilty
[1215.96 → 1218.98] And ensnare the defender in court with false testimony
[1218.98 → 1221.18] And deprive the innocent of justice
[1221.18 → 1225.38] Therefore, this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham
[1225.38 → 1227.34] Says the descendants of Jacob
[1227.34 → 1229.62] No longer will Jacob be ashamed
[1229.62 → 1232.18] No longer will their faces grow pale
[1232.18 → 1234.76] When they see among them their children
[1234.76 → 1236.10] The work of my hands
[1236.10 → 1237.60] They will keep my name holy
[1237.60 → 1241.10] They will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob
[1241.10 → 1244.84] And will stand in awe of the God of Israel
[1244.84 → 1248.32] Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding
[1248.32 → 1251.78] Those who complain will accept instruction
[1251.78 → 1255.58] Please stand as we continue singing the next two verses
[1255.58 → 1270.46] The darkness covers my open sight
[1270.46 → 1275.02] And night overtakes my troubled mind
[1275.02 → 1279.42] In darkness, you, my daylight will show
[1279.42 → 1283.10] In you, O Lord, I am found
[1283.10 → 1287.98] Oh, in you, O Lord, I am found
[1287.98 → 1299.26] Can I run from your love so deep
[1299.26 → 1301.50] So boundless and strong
[1301.50 → 1303.68] So rich, so free
[1303.68 → 1305.96] No heart, no doubt
[1305.96 → 1308.26] Can sinker in me
[1308.26 → 1311.86] In you, O Lord, I am found
[1311.86 → 1316.62] For in you, O Lord, I am found
[1316.62 → 1320.64] In you, O Lord, I am found
[1320.64 → 1325.86] For in you, O Lord, I am found
[1325.86 → 1335.52] Father, let your kingdom come
[1335.52 → 1341.10] Father, let your will be done
[1341.10 → 1353.08] Father, let your will be done
[1353.08 → 1355.92] On earth as in heaven
[1355.92 → 1360.18] Right here in my heart
[1360.18 → 1364.04] Father, let your kingdom come
[1364.04 → 1367.66] Father, let your will be done
[1367.66 → 1370.54] On earth as in heaven
[1370.54 → 1371.28] On earth as in heaven
[1371.28 → 1374.66] Right here in my heart
[1374.66 → 1379.44] We pass through day of daily prayer
[1379.44 → 1382.78] Forgive us, forgive us
[1382.78 → 1388.20] As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
[1388.20 → 1390.00] Forgive them
[1390.00 → 1391.00] And lead us, forgive us
[1391.00 → 1394.62] And lead us not to tempt us
[1394.62 → 1399.78] But deliver us from the evil one
[1399.78 → 1404.00] Let your kingdom come
[1404.00 → 1408.00] Father, let your kingdom come
[1408.00 → 1411.84] Father, let your will be done
[1411.84 → 1414.72] On earth as in heaven
[1414.72 → 1415.46] On earth as in heaven
[1415.46 → 1418.84] Right here in my heart
[1418.84 → 1422.62] Father, let your kingdom come
[1422.62 → 1426.46] Father, let your will be done
[1426.46 → 1429.72] On earth as in heaven
[1429.72 → 1433.68] Right here in my heart
[1433.68 → 1438.30] Give us this day of daily bread
[1438.30 → 1441.68] Forgive us, forgive us
[1441.68 → 1447.06] As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
[1447.06 → 1448.94] Forgive them
[1448.94 → 1453.50] And lead us not to tempt us
[1453.50 → 1459.46] But deliver us from the evil one
[1459.46 → 1460.74] Read the others
[1460.74 → 1461.88] Let your kingdom come
[1461.88 → 1462.70] Let your kingdom come
[1462.70 → 1464.66] And help us
[1464.66 → 1466.28] It is your
[1466.28 → 1468.14] It is yours
[1468.14 → 1470.20] O ours
[1470.20 → 1471.34] O yours
[1471.34 → 1473.60] The kingdom
[1473.60 → 1476.18] The power
[1476.18 → 1477.44] The glory
[1477.44 → 1478.96] Are yours
[1478.96 → 1480.28] E is yours
[1480.28 → 1480.94] E is yours
[1480.94 → 1481.34] E is yours
[1481.34 → 1484.24] All yours
[1484.24 → 1485.72] All yours
[1485.72 → 1487.48] Marquis
[1487.48 → 1508.38] And ever and ever, the kingdom is yours. It's yours, it's yours, all yours, all yours. The kingdom, the power, the glory is yours.
[1508.38 → 1522.46] It's yours, it's yours, all yours, all yours, forever and ever, the kingdom is yours.
[1522.46 → 1535.82] Father, let your kingdom come. Father, let your will be done. I'll lift us in heaven right in my heart.
[1535.82 → 1550.82] Father, let your kingdom come. Father, let your will be done. On earth as in heaven right in my heart.
[1550.82 → 1558.82] On earth as in heaven right here in my heart.
[1565.82 → 1581.82] All right, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1581.82 → 1587.52] So as they go, if you'd like to turn in your pew Bible to the book of Romans in the New Testament.
[1588.70 → 1591.54] And we are in Romans chapter one.
[1591.54 → 1604.60] So this is the third Sunday in our series so far in the book of Romans.
[1605.26 → 1616.18] And today we come to two of the most overwhelming, the most amazing, magnificent verses in the entire Bible.
[1616.18 → 1620.48] Romans chapter one, verses 16 to 17.
[1620.48 → 1626.72] And this is the theme, the theme verses of the entire book of Romans.
[1627.30 → 1631.52] And so since it's only two verses, let's read it together.
[1632.26 → 1633.20] Okay, so let's read.
[1633.20 → 1644.36] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes,
[1644.88 → 1648.42] first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
[1649.04 → 1653.66] For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed,
[1653.66 → 1659.34] a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.
[1659.82 → 1665.12] Just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith.
[1666.78 → 1667.76] That was great.
[1668.44 → 1669.46] Let's pray together.
[1671.66 → 1675.46] Our Heavenly Father, we turn to your word now.
[1676.46 → 1678.74] And we ask that you would open the heavens.
[1678.74 → 1683.18] And by your spirit, would you come down to us.
[1683.88 → 1688.48] That you would give us joy and peace in believing.
[1689.16 → 1692.52] And that you would fill us with the blessing of Christ.
[1693.12 → 1698.10] For we ask in his name, knowing that he is able to do it.
[1698.72 → 1700.22] And we pray for his sake.
[1700.54 → 1700.86] Amen.
[1700.86 → 1706.76] So Romans chapter 1, verses 16 and 17.
[1707.30 → 1713.08] These are the verses that God used to spark the Reformation.
[1713.42 → 1715.48] More than 500 years ago.
[1716.52 → 1719.96] So Martin Luther was a German monk.
[1720.32 → 1725.70] And he was up in his tower wrestling with the Bible.
[1726.26 → 1727.50] Wrestling with this text.
[1727.50 → 1731.64] And as he was doing that, God broke through.
[1732.36 → 1736.24] And he realized this changes everything.
[1737.10 → 1742.20] What he finally realized and saw in the Bible, he said,
[1742.60 → 1744.34] wow, this changes everything.
[1744.90 → 1748.76] So let me read to you a little of what Martin Luther wrote
[1748.76 → 1752.54] about his experience as he read this passage.
[1753.46 → 1754.58] He said this.
[1754.58 → 1762.38] I had a burning desire to understand what Paul meant in his letter to the Romans.
[1763.22 → 1765.26] One thing stood in my way.
[1765.44 → 1767.68] One word in chapter 1.
[1768.04 → 1771.42] The righteousness of God is revealed in it.
[1772.22 → 1781.06] I understood that righteousness as God's righteousness by which he punishes sinners who are unrighteous.
[1781.06 → 1785.68] And I hated the righteous God who punishes sinners.
[1786.92 → 1792.72] In silence, if I did not blaspheme, then certainly I grumbled, and I got angry at God.
[1793.36 → 1797.74] I constantly badgered St. Paul about that spot in Romans 1.
[1798.40 → 1801.30] And anxiously wanted to know what he meant.
[1801.30 → 1811.80] I meditated night and day on those words until at last, by the mercy of God, I paid attention to their context.
[1812.96 → 1814.50] Something that we should all do.
[1816.16 → 1820.96] The righteousness of God is revealed in it as it is written,
[1821.74 → 1825.88] The righteous shall live by faith.
[1825.88 → 1828.20] He continues,
[1828.20 → 1838.96] I began to understand that in this verse, the righteousness of God is that by which the righteous person lives by a gift of God that is by faith.
[1839.68 → 1848.12] All at once I felt as though I had been born again and entered into paradise itself through open gates.
[1849.28 → 1852.44] Immediately I saw the whole of scripture in a different light.
[1852.44 → 1862.22] I exalted the sweetest word of mine, the righteousness of God, with as much love as before I had hated it with hate.
[1862.80 → 1867.94] This phrase of Paul was for me the very gate of paradise.
[1869.20 → 1871.78] And the rest is history, as they say.
[1872.66 → 1874.68] Luther started to preach.
[1874.74 → 1875.74] He started to write.
[1876.10 → 1878.98] He started to spread this good news everywhere.
[1878.98 → 1887.32] The good news that through faith in Jesus Christ, God takes sinners like each one of us, and he makes us righteous,
[1888.04 → 1894.70] not because we deserve it, but because of his righteousness, because of his mercy and his grace.
[1896.30 → 1904.72] And so friends, let it be our prayer this morning that these verses would become, again, for each one of us, the open gate of paradise.
[1904.72 → 1915.34] You know, and even if you've been a Christian for a long time, let us make a fresh discovery of the gospel together this morning with God's help.
[1915.88 → 1916.74] So that's our prayer.
[1916.74 → 1922.72] So how is it that the gospel is the open gates of paradise?
[1923.64 → 1926.80] And so let's have a look at these just two amazing verses.
[1927.56 → 1935.86] And this morning, what I want to do is just take it phrase by phrase and just talk about and try to understand together what Paul is teaching us here.
[1936.28 → 1937.34] So let's do that.
[1937.42 → 1939.78] And we begin in verse 16.
[1940.36 → 1943.70] For I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[1944.60 → 1945.84] I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[1945.84 → 1948.70] So what do we make of this word gospel?
[1950.00 → 1951.30] Have you heard that word before?
[1952.02 → 1952.72] Of course.
[1952.84 → 1955.32] We're so used to hearing this word in the church.
[1955.82 → 1958.82] But it's not self-obvious what it means.
[1958.86 → 1962.06] If you just said the word gospel, like, that's kind of a weird word.
[1962.16 → 1963.50] Like, what does that mean?
[1964.48 → 1969.26] It's a word, though, that had great significance in Paul's day.
[1969.26 → 1984.40] Which is why the New Testament writers and Jesus himself seized upon this word as a way to encapsulate and package all that God had done through Jesus Christ.
[1984.40 → 1996.54] So in the first century, in the Roman world, when something momentous happened, maybe the birth of a new emperor or a great victory in battle,
[1996.54 → 2015.94] heralds or preachers were sent out into all the Roman world to all the major city centres where humanity was to herald the evangelion, the Greek word, the gospel, the good news of Roman victory, whatever it happened to be.
[2015.94 → 2024.38] So the preaching of the gospel in the ancient world was something that everyone understood and everyone looked forward to.
[2024.90 → 2027.74] And at every age, right, people love a reason to celebrate.
[2027.86 → 2028.88] They love a reason to party.
[2029.72 → 2038.60] So this was the preaching of the gospel, the good news of this great victory that the Roman army had accomplished.
[2038.60 → 2047.28] So now this is one of the reasons why William Tyndale, one of the early reformers, he defines the word gospel in this way.
[2048.28 → 2060.28] He says, as good, merry, glad, and joyful news that makes a man's heart glad and makes him sing and dance and leap for joy.
[2061.74 → 2063.24] I mean, that sounds pretty great, right?
[2063.24 → 2073.24] What kind of news would cause you to sing and dance and leap for joy?
[2074.36 → 2077.06] Like what if someone came and knocked on your door and told you good news?
[2077.16 → 2081.04] What would they have to say to make you respond in that kind of way?
[2083.10 → 2089.16] Now we can see then why the New Testament writers, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[2089.16 → 2097.38] they used this word gospel, they stole it from the Roman world to talk about not what the Lord Caesar had accomplished,
[2097.52 → 2103.78] but what the Lord Jesus Christ had accomplished in God's great victories.
[2104.86 → 2105.06] Right?
[2105.10 → 2113.06] They needed a word that people could understand that would package the good news of what Jesus had done to establish his kingdom.
[2113.48 → 2116.04] That he had broken the power of sin and death.
[2116.04 → 2124.64] That he offers forgiveness and salvation and life and his grace and the Holy Spirit to all who turned to him in faith.
[2125.90 → 2129.56] And that word gospel was just the word they needed.
[2130.70 → 2134.46] And so we can say this word gospel, when we just say the gospel,
[2134.88 → 2140.72] it's shorthand for all the saving accomplishments of God through Jesus Christ.
[2140.72 → 2148.00] His birth into this world in humility, his death on the cross, that was all sufficient for us.
[2148.34 → 2153.08] His resurrection from the dead, his ascension to the right hand of God, his reigning in power.
[2153.72 → 2154.44] It's the gospel.
[2155.26 → 2156.18] What he has done.
[2156.72 → 2160.16] And that's why the next phrase we're going to look at, Paul says,
[2160.54 → 2162.74] for I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[2163.42 → 2165.24] I'm not ashamed of this gospel.
[2165.24 → 2170.96] And when he says that, I am not ashamed, it's a figure of speech.
[2171.58 → 2178.62] It's like, it's when a writer or a speaker uses a deliberate understatement to make a point.
[2179.20 → 2182.52] So for example, if I say, you know, I'm not half bad at basketball.
[2183.56 → 2184.20] What does that mean?
[2186.40 → 2187.10] Yeah, no.
[2187.26 → 2188.22] I'm pretty good.
[2188.78 → 2193.32] If I'm not half bad, it means I'm a good, you know, it's just like understated, right?
[2193.32 → 2197.36] So when Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel, what does it mean?
[2198.38 → 2200.60] I'm proud of the gospel, right?
[2201.04 → 2204.52] Or as he says in 1 Corinthians 1, verse 31,
[2205.08 → 2208.38] let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.
[2209.66 → 2211.96] I'm not ashamed of the gospel, Paul says.
[2212.24 → 2216.30] I will boast in Christ's accomplishments, his victories.
[2216.84 → 2218.50] I will not be ashamed of my Lord.
[2219.58 → 2222.28] And there's a story of a man named Polycarp.
[2222.28 → 2227.14] He was an early church father about 100 years after Paul wrote this letter to the Romans.
[2227.70 → 2232.66] He is on trial for his allegiance to Christ.
[2233.10 → 2235.82] And he's told, you need to deny Christ.
[2235.94 → 2237.18] You need to curse Christ.
[2237.62 → 2239.12] Swear allegiance to Caesar.
[2239.44 → 2241.10] Or else you're going to be executed.
[2242.06 → 2245.02] And here's what Polycarp wrote or said in response.
[2245.02 → 2251.54] Eighty-six years have I served him, and he never did me any wrong.
[2251.66 → 2255.40] How then can I blaspheme my king and my saviour?
[2256.84 → 2260.52] And he marched off to his execution, unashamed.
[2261.76 → 2262.28] Right?
[2262.36 → 2264.06] And that's what it looks like to be unashamed.
[2264.22 → 2268.46] It's for 86 years, Jesus has been nothing but good to me.
[2268.46 → 2271.48] And am I going to go deny him?
[2272.22 → 2272.62] No.
[2273.18 → 2279.64] No matter what you say, no matter what you threaten, I will not deny my saviour.
[2281.20 → 2282.74] He's not ashamed of the gospel.
[2283.50 → 2287.78] And so how can Polycarp say that, even in the face of death?
[2288.72 → 2291.12] Why does Paul say he's not ashamed of the gospel?
[2291.12 → 2293.42] Well, let's look at the next phrase.
[2296.40 → 2303.60] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation.
[2304.88 → 2305.04] Okay?
[2305.28 → 2314.40] The gospel, this good news announcing Jesus' saving accomplishments, is the power of God for salvation.
[2315.26 → 2320.10] And it's very important that this word is in the present tense.
[2321.12 → 2321.82] The present tense.
[2321.88 → 2328.00] The gospel is now, today, continues to be the power of God for salvation.
[2328.78 → 2328.90] Right?
[2328.96 → 2340.08] So that very same power that 2,000 years ago was by which God, Jesus, died on the cross to pay the cost of all of our sin and to rise from the dead.
[2340.86 → 2348.04] That power is made available to us today in the preaching, the heralding of the gospel.
[2348.04 → 2355.06] You know, in we Christians, churches, we are powerless by ourselves.
[2355.36 → 2358.24] We are fragile apart from the gospel.
[2358.46 → 2359.36] We are weak.
[2359.98 → 2360.90] We are very weak.
[2360.90 → 2373.50] But if we proclaim, and if we believe, and we trust in, and we rejoice in the gospel, God will work his power among us.
[2374.46 → 2376.88] It's as if the gospel is like electricity.
[2377.80 → 2377.94] Right?
[2377.94 → 2383.56] And so when the power of God gets into our lives, we become alive to God.
[2383.64 → 2384.88] We get turned on, as it were.
[2385.58 → 2392.08] And if the gospel is like electricity, the power of God, then you and I are like light bulbs.
[2392.70 → 2394.86] So think of yourself this morning as a light bulb.
[2394.86 → 2402.40] And as a light bulb, you and I, we were all designed to be lit up by the power of God.
[2402.88 → 2409.14] For the glory of God, to shine the light of God in this world so that everyone can see the goodness of God.
[2409.22 → 2412.16] We were made in God's image to reflect his glory in the world.
[2413.50 → 2417.66] In sin, what sin did was it unscrewed the light bulb.
[2417.66 → 2418.66] Right?
[2419.70 → 2423.24] And so in Jesus, he comes, and he's not just another light bulb.
[2423.94 → 2425.16] He is the electricity.
[2425.42 → 2427.84] He is the source of power of God.
[2428.24 → 2434.76] And so then when we, as it were, are kind of screwed back into Jesus, we become alive.
[2435.78 → 2437.20] We become lit up.
[2437.26 → 2440.66] We become alive with the power of God shining through us.
[2441.46 → 2443.24] And then we are not ashamed of the gospel.
[2443.24 → 2448.34] And then we start loving our neighbours, even when it's hard.
[2448.82 → 2452.18] And we start being willing to take up our cross and follow him.
[2452.34 → 2453.64] And we are happy to do it.
[2454.76 → 2457.70] Then we will want to sing and dance and leap for joy.
[2459.44 → 2463.12] And that is what the Bible calls salvation.
[2463.98 → 2464.20] Right?
[2464.24 → 2465.72] The next phrase that we have here.
[2466.22 → 2472.10] For I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation.
[2473.24 → 2477.88] Now, when Paul speaks of salvation, what exactly does he mean?
[2479.22 → 2484.14] Does he mean that initial salvation when we first become a Christian?
[2484.84 → 2484.98] Right?
[2485.02 → 2488.12] Is he saying the gospel is adequate for conversion?
[2488.54 → 2489.62] To bring us to faith?
[2490.76 → 2494.96] Or is Paul speaking of our final salvation?
[2495.24 → 2495.38] Right?
[2495.42 → 2496.50] The end of the world.
[2496.60 → 2497.42] The final judgment.
[2497.42 → 2504.78] And saying that the gospel then has the power to keep us until that day and through that day.
[2505.68 → 2507.04] Of course, what's the answer?
[2508.48 → 2508.94] Yes.
[2509.30 → 2509.76] Right?
[2510.04 → 2511.86] Both are certainly true.
[2512.40 → 2512.52] Right?
[2512.58 → 2515.92] The gospel is God's power to bring us to faith in the first place.
[2516.74 → 2519.48] But the context here, remember context is important.
[2519.48 → 2525.80] It makes it certain that Paul is talking about our future salvation at the end of history.
[2526.56 → 2528.54] Because remember who Paul is talking to.
[2528.62 → 2530.84] And we mentioned this the last couple of weeks.
[2531.58 → 2533.22] But in verse 15, he says,
[2533.34 → 2537.78] I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome.
[2538.74 → 2539.76] And who are they?
[2539.86 → 2541.82] Who is the recipient of this letter?
[2541.96 → 2542.94] It's the church.
[2542.94 → 2550.12] They are those who, verse 7, already are loved by God and called to be his holy people.
[2550.72 → 2556.84] So Paul says, I want to preach the gospel to you, Christian believers, you saints in Rome,
[2556.98 → 2561.64] because it is the power of God to keep you through your whole life.
[2562.34 → 2562.50] Right?
[2562.58 → 2564.76] Through all the difficulties and all the joys.
[2565.26 → 2570.48] To keep you until that judgment day and into the glory of his eternal kingdom.
[2570.48 → 2581.76] So that means, you know, Jesus is not just the doorway into then just like this blank white, you know, slate with God.
[2582.76 → 2585.00] It's not just the doorway into our salvation.
[2585.14 → 2587.92] It's not just the ABCs of the Christian life.
[2588.32 → 2590.36] Where then you just have to hoof it on your own.
[2591.60 → 2592.02] Right?
[2592.06 → 2592.90] That's not the gospel.
[2593.26 → 2597.38] The gospel is constant dependence on Jesus Christ.
[2597.38 → 2600.76] It's constantly growing in our life with him.
[2600.92 → 2604.94] Staying connected by his grace to the power source.
[2605.36 → 2610.10] Walking with him each day until we reach the gates of paradise itself.
[2611.04 → 2611.16] Right?
[2611.20 → 2614.28] That's the power of God that brings salvation.
[2616.06 → 2620.54] Now, the next question is, great, the power of God that brings salvation.
[2621.34 → 2622.58] Who is this for?
[2622.70 → 2624.38] Who can receive this power?
[2624.82 → 2626.18] Who can receive this salvation?
[2626.18 → 2627.84] So let's look at the next phrase.
[2629.44 → 2636.80] For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes.
[2637.50 → 2640.70] First to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
[2641.50 → 2644.42] The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel for all.
[2647.04 → 2648.08] This is important.
[2648.94 → 2649.10] Right?
[2649.10 → 2652.80] And when he says, first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
[2653.42 → 2654.08] You know what?
[2654.14 → 2657.00] This is a distinction that God made.
[2657.86 → 2658.02] Right?
[2658.28 → 2659.94] Jew and Gentile.
[2660.42 → 2661.72] This is something that God made.
[2662.34 → 2667.72] And in the Bible, we see the various ways that God made this distinction between Jew and Gentile.
[2668.06 → 2669.88] He gave the Jews circumcision.
[2670.40 → 2672.90] He gave them all these dietary restrictions.
[2672.90 → 2675.56] And to teach them about holiness.
[2675.56 → 2677.06] He gave them his law.
[2678.42 → 2684.04] And all of these things were to separate his people as belonging to God, as his holy people.
[2684.58 → 2685.92] Jew and non-Jew.
[2686.98 → 2691.20] But then Jesus, in the gospel, he tears down that separation.
[2691.20 → 2694.08] And here's the implication of that.
[2694.18 → 2702.42] It's a if a distinction that God made, Jew and Gentile, God now eradicates by the cross of Jesus,
[2703.24 → 2708.36] how much more than any of the man-made distinctions that we make,
[2708.42 → 2713.16] how much more are they completely irrelevant because of the cross?
[2714.74 → 2715.30] Right?
[2715.36 → 2720.36] How much more are the ways that we set up divisions and dividing lines between us?
[2721.20 → 2724.72] Between us and whoever the other person is.
[2724.82 → 2731.64] You know whether it's divisions of race or class or education or whatever it is.
[2732.70 → 2734.62] And Paul says, he says this.
[2734.68 → 2738.18] He says, if you look back at verse 14, he says,
[2738.30 → 2740.94] I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks.
[2741.00 → 2741.12] Right?
[2741.18 → 2742.64] To Gentiles and to Jews.
[2742.82 → 2744.46] Both to the wise and the foolish.
[2745.90 → 2746.12] Right?
[2746.18 → 2747.68] He's talking about nationality.
[2747.68 → 2751.20] He's talking about language and culture.
[2751.38 → 2753.50] The educated, the uneducated commoner.
[2753.98 → 2755.84] Paul says, I'm after everyone.
[2756.24 → 2757.52] The gospel is for everyone.
[2757.68 → 2761.64] Because the power of God for salvation is not just for the Jew.
[2762.34 → 2763.40] It's for the Gentile.
[2763.44 → 2764.16] It's for everybody.
[2765.12 → 2766.42] And what does that mean for us here?
[2767.00 → 2768.82] What does that mean for us at Latin or CRC?
[2768.82 → 2774.54] You know, we are a relatively fairly wealthy congregation.
[2775.52 → 2776.42] We're generous.
[2776.56 → 2777.10] We give a lot.
[2777.80 → 2781.76] We are largely of the same majority culture of ethnicity.
[2781.76 → 2790.10] And so what that means is that we need to pay attention to how the way that we do things or our preferences,
[2790.30 → 2802.58] even if they're good preferences, how they may be hindering us from becoming a place where more people could belong to Jesus Christ in our midst.
[2803.76 → 2803.98] Right?
[2804.04 → 2806.54] Especially people who are not like us.
[2807.14 → 2807.68] Right?
[2807.68 → 2816.12] Who don't look like us, who don't talk like us, that don't act like us, who aren't from the same family background or whatever it is.
[2818.06 → 2826.76] What are the things that we maybe even unintentionally have set up by the way we do things, the way we are together,
[2826.76 → 2833.82] that create barriers for everyone coming and staying and belonging here?
[2835.38 → 2835.60] Right?
[2835.64 → 2837.00] Because the gospel is for everyone.
[2837.68 → 2845.56] And we want to embody that reality of the gospel in our very own congregation, in our life together.
[2846.58 → 2846.82] Right?
[2846.88 → 2856.14] In the world out there, it sets up all kinds of divisions, all kinds of separations and reasons for people to stay separated from one another.
[2856.14 → 2859.02] But it is not to be so in the church.
[2859.72 → 2861.12] Because the gospel is for everyone.
[2861.12 → 2870.46] So now, as we move on to the next phrase, we come now to verse 17.
[2871.30 → 2873.50] This is what Paul continues to say.
[2874.94 → 2879.94] For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed.
[2879.94 → 2883.86] Now, I think this is an interesting question.
[2883.86 → 2893.84] Now, if you had to write verse 17, how would you write it if you were in charge by the, you know, by the Holy Spirit?
[2893.84 → 2894.84] Right?
[2894.84 → 2898.94] So, the gospel is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes.
[2899.58 → 2903.48] For in the gospel, what is revealed?
[2903.68 → 2904.32] What would you say?
[2904.32 → 2910.18] You might say, in the gospel, the love of God is revealed.
[2911.18 → 2913.70] Or the grace of God is revealed.
[2913.98 → 2914.14] Right?
[2914.20 → 2915.94] Or the mercy of God.
[2916.00 → 2917.58] Or the kindness of God.
[2918.04 → 2919.42] All of which would be true.
[2919.42 → 2925.68] But if you ask, why does the gospel have power to save us?
[2926.08 → 2930.54] The reason is that in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed.
[2931.58 → 2932.12] Right?
[2932.20 → 2936.52] In our relationship with God, righteousness is a central issue.
[2937.64 → 2938.24] Right?
[2938.30 → 2939.10] This is important.
[2940.34 → 2944.08] God demands righteousness through the law.
[2945.10 → 2946.36] He is a righteous God.
[2946.36 → 2948.72] He created us to live rightly with him.
[2949.42 → 2951.34] And he demands us to live this way.
[2952.16 → 2953.38] But there's a problem.
[2953.76 → 2954.76] We are not righteous.
[2955.26 → 2956.00] We have sinned.
[2956.24 → 2958.40] We are far from righteous, in fact.
[2959.58 → 2965.98] And so, the gospel is the power of God for salvation because in it, God reveals not our righteousness,
[2966.86 → 2968.86] but he reveals his righteousness.
[2969.66 → 2971.26] The righteousness of God.
[2972.28 → 2973.44] This is very important.
[2973.44 → 2976.48] The gospel is not about your human righteousness.
[2976.48 → 2981.90] It's not about what you have achieved, what you can do, who you are.
[2982.10 → 2987.50] It's about who God is, what he has achieved, his righteousness.
[2988.24 → 2988.66] Right?
[2988.72 → 2990.06] So, it doesn't originate in us.
[2990.28 → 2994.68] It doesn't come about because of my works, but from God's saving accomplishments.
[2994.68 → 2996.98] And here's the amazing thing.
[2997.06 → 3004.06] In Jesus Christ, God takes his righteousness, and he sees us unrighteous people.
[3004.52 → 3005.92] We can't live up to his law.
[3006.26 → 3007.84] We are lost apart from him.
[3008.02 → 3010.80] And he takes his righteousness, and he gives it to us.
[3010.80 → 3013.92] And we receive it.
[3014.18 → 3015.34] He gives us his righteousness.
[3016.08 → 3021.18] You know, and there is only one other place in the New Testament where the exact same Greek words,
[3022.14 → 3024.96] as we see here, the righteousness of God, are used.
[3025.50 → 3028.26] It's in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 21.
[3028.26 → 3040.86] God made him, Jesus, who had no sin, to be sin for us so that in him, we might become the righteousness of God.
[3042.80 → 3047.20] That is why the gospel is the power of God for our salvation.
[3047.20 → 3049.22] Because God has dealt with our sin.
[3049.66 → 3054.12] God remained righteous in saving us.
[3054.12 → 3057.96] Because he paid the penalty that we deserved for our sin.
[3058.10 → 3060.82] He maintained his righteousness, his justice.
[3061.16 → 3063.92] Justice was done because Jesus died for us.
[3064.52 → 3069.82] So then, Jesus paid the penalty for our sin.
[3070.54 → 3072.56] Our unrighteousness is forgiven.
[3073.44 → 3075.14] And then he gives us his own righteousness.
[3076.22 → 3078.72] And this is what God is doing in the gospel.
[3078.72 → 3079.16] Right?
[3079.22 → 3085.84] He is offering us his own personal righteousness by offering it to us through his son, Jesus Christ.
[3087.36 → 3094.44] And that's why the rest of the verse says that it is a righteousness that we just receive by faith.
[3094.88 → 3096.74] And we'll finish with this last point.
[3096.98 → 3097.96] So let's look at it here.
[3097.96 → 3103.66] For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed.
[3103.80 → 3110.28] A righteousness that is by faith from first to last, from our whole Christian life.
[3111.14 → 3118.46] Just as it is written in the Old Testament, the righteous will live by faith.
[3118.52 → 3118.64] Right?
[3118.68 → 3119.40] It's not a new thing.
[3119.46 → 3120.80] This is the way God has always worked.
[3120.80 → 3130.76] So how do we, who are unrighteous sinners, how do we get this gift of righteousness from a righteous God?
[3131.92 → 3132.14] Right?
[3132.18 → 3133.16] How do we get this gift?
[3133.24 → 3134.36] How do we become righteous?
[3135.14 → 3137.94] The answer is by faith.
[3138.56 → 3138.70] Right?
[3138.96 → 3139.58] By faith.
[3140.60 → 3145.84] And faith, it doesn't mean just believing that Jesus was crucified and that he rose from the dead.
[3146.98 → 3150.78] Those are historical facts to agree with.
[3150.80 → 3150.86] Faith.
[3152.36 → 3157.60] Faith, what faith is, believing in the gospel of Jesus Christ, it means trust.
[3158.34 → 3159.18] Trusting in him.
[3159.76 → 3164.34] Receiving with open hands the accomplishments of Jesus Christ on our behalf.
[3165.58 → 3174.62] Putting our faith in him is the way that God screws us as light bulbs back into the power of the gospel.
[3175.22 → 3178.78] Lighting us up to the love of God for us in Jesus Christ.
[3179.26 → 3179.42] Right?
[3179.42 → 3182.32] The love which Paul says, you know, about God.
[3182.40 → 3184.34] He loved me and gave himself for me.
[3185.60 → 3187.46] So here's how Martin Luther put it.
[3187.80 → 3191.38] He said this, you know, in his 95 thesis, thesis number 25.
[3191.86 → 3192.60] He wrote this.
[3192.60 → 3195.64] He is not righteous who does much.
[3195.64 → 3201.76] But he who, without work, believes much in Christ.
[3203.62 → 3205.84] Our righteousness is received by faith.
[3207.12 → 3211.50] Not those who do much, but those who believe much are made righteous.
[3211.50 → 3218.42] And so, friends, if the gospel is the saving accomplishment of God, what is faith?
[3219.42 → 3224.96] Faith is the human response by which God lays hold of us.
[3224.96 → 3227.38] He accomplished our salvation.
[3227.38 → 3231.04] He's going to give us his righteousness when we are unrighteous.
[3231.48 → 3236.28] And by faith, he lays hold of us and we receive.
[3236.56 → 3237.26] That's all we do.
[3237.26 → 3244.26] One of my favourite examples of this from Christian history is from a preacher called William Haslam.
[3244.98 → 3254.54] So he was an 18th century preacher in England, an Anglican pastor, who pastored a church in Cornwall, England.
[3254.54 → 3257.88] And he was preaching the gospel one day in church.
[3258.32 → 3264.12] And much to his surprise, and much to the surprise of his whole congregation, he began to believe it.
[3264.82 → 3268.68] He was converted by his own preaching, his own sermon.
[3269.28 → 3270.80] And he wrote about this experience.
[3271.88 → 3277.86] He was preaching from Matthew 22, verse 42, which says in the King James,
[3278.70 → 3280.86] What think ye of Jesus?
[3281.50 → 3283.02] What do you think of Christ?
[3283.02 → 3286.44] And this is what he writes about what happened.
[3287.54 → 3287.92] He said,
[3288.52 → 3290.46] As I went on to explain the passage,
[3291.42 → 3295.84] I saw that the Pharisees and scribes did not know that Christ was the Son of God,
[3296.18 → 3297.98] or that he had come to save them.
[3298.80 → 3302.32] They were looking for a king, the Son of David, to reign over them.
[3303.92 → 3305.74] Something was telling me all the time,
[3306.24 → 3308.12] You're no better than the Pharisees yourself.
[3308.84 → 3310.98] You did not believe that he is the Son of God,
[3310.98 → 3314.66] and that he came to save you any more than they did.
[3314.66 → 3318.04] I do not remember all I said,
[3318.04 → 3322.84] but I felt a wonderful light and joy coming into my soul.
[3323.46 → 3327.08] And I was beginning to see what the Pharisees did not.
[3328.08 → 3332.94] Whether it was something in my words, or in my manner, or my look, I know not.
[3332.94 → 3336.88] But all of a sudden, a local preacher, who happened to be in the congregation,
[3337.40 → 3341.32] stood up, and putting up his arms, he shouted out,
[3341.78 → 3343.22] The parson is converted!
[3343.74 → 3345.44] The parson is converted!
[3345.84 → 3346.34] Hallelujah!
[3346.34 → 3355.76] In another moment, my voice was lost in the shouts and praises of three or four hundred of the congregation.
[3356.56 → 3359.90] Instead of rebuking this extraordinary brawling,
[3360.36 → 3362.70] as I would have called it in the former times,
[3363.18 → 3365.60] I joined in the outbreak of praise,
[3366.14 → 3368.02] and then gave out the doxology,
[3368.58 → 3371.46] Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[3371.46 → 3378.38] And the people sing it over and over again.
[3380.26 → 3381.76] So you see what happened there.
[3382.62 → 3386.70] The knowledge of the gospel that we all know so well,
[3388.06 → 3391.28] it went from something out there to something in here.
[3391.28 → 3394.84] He believed, he trusted,
[3395.96 → 3396.78] in the God
[3396.78 → 3398.62] who died for him.
[3398.90 → 3401.04] Not just as something to understand,
[3401.60 → 3402.78] but something to trust.
[3404.02 → 3405.60] And that's not something we can put
[3405.60 → 3407.04] in the order of worship.
[3408.50 → 3410.08] I can't do it for you.
[3410.92 → 3412.32] I can't even do it for myself.
[3413.38 → 3414.54] But Jesus can.
[3414.64 → 3416.18] Jesus can awaken our hearts.
[3416.92 → 3418.32] He can make us alive
[3418.32 → 3420.40] through faith in him.
[3421.28 → 3421.82] You know, friends,
[3421.94 → 3426.34] Jesus opened up the gates of paradise,
[3427.22 → 3429.60] and he will give us this gift of faith
[3429.60 → 3431.72] to walk through them
[3431.72 → 3433.34] when we receive him
[3433.34 → 3434.74] with open hearts and open hands.
[3435.70 → 3436.40] Let's pray.
[3437.96 → 3439.04] And I want to invite you
[3439.04 → 3440.06] to take a moment
[3440.06 → 3443.14] to respond to God,
[3443.60 → 3445.12] whatever you feel like
[3445.12 → 3446.38] he is saying to you this morning.
[3446.96 → 3447.54] Just take a moment
[3447.54 → 3448.70] to respond to him in prayer.
[3449.42 → 3450.52] And then I'll close for us.
[3451.28 → 3451.60] Amen.
[3451.60 → 3451.72] Amen.
[3451.72 → 3451.92] Amen.
[3451.92 → 3452.06] Amen.
[3464.56 → 3466.18] Our Father in heaven,
[3466.80 → 3468.98] according to your promise,
[3469.52 → 3472.62] we pray that your enlivening gospel
[3472.62 → 3474.76] would so enliven our hearts
[3474.76 → 3476.86] that we would put our faith
[3476.86 → 3477.86] and our trust in you
[3477.86 → 3479.74] and the salvation
[3479.74 → 3481.52] that you have accomplished for us.
[3482.44 → 3483.68] We pray that you would
[3483.68 → 3485.28] speak into existence
[3485.28 → 3487.08] the faith that we cannot.
[3488.44 → 3490.40] And we pray that as we receive it,
[3490.50 → 3490.60] Lord,
[3490.66 → 3492.02] that you would change us,
[3492.70 → 3494.30] that we would take up our cross
[3494.30 → 3495.02] and follow you,
[3495.14 → 3495.96] that we would be
[3495.96 → 3497.98] people who are unashamed
[3497.98 → 3498.64] of the gospel,
[3498.64 → 3499.78] that we would leap
[3499.78 → 3500.36] and shout
[3500.36 → 3502.68] and dance for joy
[3502.68 → 3505.08] because of your great love.
[3505.70 → 3506.90] In the holy name of Christ,
[3506.98 → 3507.36] we pray.
[3507.94 → 3508.26] Amen.
[3511.10 → 3511.60] All right.
[3511.64 → 3512.68] Let's prepare to stand
[3512.68 → 3513.44] as we are able
[3513.44 → 3514.22] and we'll sing
[3514.22 → 3515.12] our song of response.
[3515.12 → 3541.98] Shout
[3541.98 → 3545.82] of Jesus our King.
[3546.34 → 3550.06] Make known the power of His grace,
[3550.20 → 3553.36] the beauty of His peace.
[3553.90 → 3557.64] Remember how His mercy reached
[3557.64 → 3560.84] and we cried out to Him.
[3561.48 → 3564.48] He lifted us to solid
[3564.48 → 3567.98] the freedom from our sin.
[3567.98 → 3572.42] O sing my song
[3572.42 → 3576.20] and hear all His dawn
[3576.20 → 3578.58] till the earth and heavens
[3578.58 → 3581.38] are filled with His glory.
[3584.12 → 3587.46] We've done the name of Jesus,
[3587.84 → 3591.12] of Jesus our Lord.
[3591.62 → 3593.46] His power in us,
[3593.46 → 3595.18] He's greater than,
[3595.18 → 3598.30] He's greater than this world.
[3599.04 → 3602.68] To share the reasons for our hope,
[3603.04 → 3606.04] to some with love and grace.
[3606.48 → 3610.02] That all who sing Him shine through us,
[3610.28 → 3613.44] I'll bring the love of our praise.
[3613.44 → 3617.18] O sing my song,
[3617.60 → 3620.86] and do all He's done,
[3621.36 → 3623.24] till the earth and heavens
[3623.24 → 3625.76] are filled with His glory.
[3625.76 → 3635.02] He's given the name of Jesus,
[3635.02 → 3639.52] of Jesus our light.
[3640.02 → 3643.52] No other name on earth can seek,
[3643.76 → 3645.92] and raise a soul to life.
[3647.26 → 3650.78] He opens up our eyes to see,
[3651.22 → 3653.98] then always He has grown.
[3653.98 → 3660.98] We live in His fields of grace as healing sinners hold.
[3662.02 → 3668.86] Oh, sing my song and tell all He's done,
[3669.20 → 3673.68] till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[3675.82 → 3683.50] Oh, sing my song and tell all He's done,
[3683.50 → 3688.26] till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[3701.90 → 3705.18] This morning's offering is for local church ministries,
[3705.40 → 3709.48] so that encompasses everything from cadets and gems,
[3709.48 → 3713.76] kids' life, cross-training, friendship, and our Chinese ministry.
[3713.94 → 3716.96] So many of these ministries are just starting up now in the last couple of weeks,
[3717.24 → 3719.84] and your generosity is much appreciated.
[3719.98 → 3721.08] So please give us your able.
[3721.08 → 3723.52] Thank you.
[3723.64 → 3724.64] ¡Racial!
[3724.64 → 3725.64] Amen.
[3754.64 → 3756.64] Amen.
[3784.64 → 3786.64] Amen.
[3814.64 → 3816.64] Amen.
[3816.64 → 3818.64] Amen.
[3818.64 → 3820.64] Amen.
[3820.64 → 3841.64] Let us come before God now in a time of community prayer.
[3841.64 → 3845.64] Almighty God, we thank you for your presence here this morning.
[3845.64 → 3849.64] Your love stirs in us a desire to praise your name.
[3849.64 → 3851.64] We are surrounded by beauty here in Canada.
[3851.64 → 3854.64] As we step into the forest or sail out into the bay,
[3854.64 → 3858.64] we are reminded of your power, your goodness, and your splendour.
[3858.64 → 3862.64] And yet we know that this is just a foretaste of what awaits us in heaven.
[3862.64 → 3866.64] For as it is written, what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard,
[3866.64 → 3869.64] and what no human mind has conceived,
[3869.64 → 3874.64] the things of God has prepared for us for those who love him.
[3874.64 → 3879.64] We thank you for your word, for your promises revealed to us in scripture,
[3879.64 → 3883.64] for your wisdom, for your righteousness, for your instruction,
[3883.64 → 3886.64] and for your grace and your mercy.
[3886.64 → 3889.64] We are truly blessed by you.
[3889.64 → 3895.64] But many places in this world feel far away from your goodness.
[3895.64 → 3903.64] Millions live in fear, under the spectre of warfare, bloodshed, famine, injustice, and persecution.
[3903.64 → 3908.64] Indeed, some in our very congregation have come here to escape things such as these.
[3908.64 → 3912.64] And for the rest of us, it is beyond our comprehension.
[3912.64 → 3917.64] We pray for your sovereignty, Lord.
[3917.64 → 3926.64] Restore peace, and yes, even prosperity, to places like Sudan, Ukraine, the Middle East, Myanmar, North Korea,
[3926.64 → 3931.64] and many other places, Lord, far too numerous to name.
[3931.64 → 3934.64] We know all good things come from you.
[3934.64 → 3940.64] And these people are in desperate need of a large measure of your goodness and your righteousness.
[3940.64 → 3945.64] There is suffering here too, Lord, closer to home and among this congregation.
[3945.64 → 3952.64] The effects of sickness and old age and grief and death weigh on many of us here this morning.
[3952.64 → 3966.64] We pray for Ellie, Carl, George, Jerry, Shirley, Eileen, Diane, Hank, Liz, Ted, and Tony.
[3966.64 → 3974.64] And Lord, we ask you to draw near to Art Hoekstra, who mourns the loss of his sister Hilda.
[3974.64 → 3979.64] And we ask for healing and strength for Pat, who is struggling with kidney disease.
[3979.64 → 3984.64] We pray for continued healing for Henry, who has undergone by what all counts,
[3984.64 → 3986.64] seems to be a successful hip surgery, Lord.
[3986.64 → 3994.64] But we know that is an invasive procedure, and she is struggling in hospital just to get better and to be healed.
[3994.64 → 4000.64] And we pray too for Grace, who is in hospital, what looks like a long-term stay in hospital, Lord.
[4000.64 → 4007.64] And we ask just for your healing and your mercy and to draw near to her and hold her.
[4007.64 → 4010.64] And we pray too for those not mentioned in this prayer.
[4010.64 → 4014.64] For those afflictions unknown to us, we pray.
[4014.64 → 4018.64] For all those who suffer the endless battle against lifelong illnesses.
[4018.64 → 4021.64] For those who struggle against daily pain and chronic health issues.
[4021.64 → 4028.64] For those suffering with mental illness, depression, addiction, with brokenness, with loneliness.
[4028.64 → 4031.64] For those grieving the loss of a loved one.
[4031.64 → 4035.64] And for those among us who face the daily effects of old age.
[4035.64 → 4037.64] We ask you, Lord, be near to them.
[4037.64 → 4042.64] We know our prayers here this morning are imperfect.
[4042.64 → 4046.64] But through you, Lord, they are made perfect.
[4046.64 → 4049.64] You know their suffering and hear their cries.
[4049.64 → 4052.64] We ask again, Lord, for your mercy and comfort.
[4052.64 → 4056.64] For you are a God who hears the agony of the suffering.
[4056.64 → 4058.64] And you step in when we need it the most.
[4058.64 → 4062.64] You are a God that suffers with us and for us.
[4062.64 → 4065.64] You walk among us, and you fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[4065.64 → 4069.64] We pray for our church here in Ladder.
[4069.64 → 4071.64] Guide our work through your Holy Spirit.
[4071.64 → 4075.64] May the work we do here be honouring and glorifying to you.
[4075.64 → 4078.64] Guide our imperfect work through your Holy Spirit.
[4078.64 → 4079.64] And make it perfect.
[4079.64 → 4081.64] Turn our hearts towards what is good.
[4081.64 → 4084.64] Grant us humility and meekness in all we do.
[4084.64 → 4087.64] Thank you for this family of believers.
[4087.64 → 4091.64] Compassionate, thoughtful people that look to do good in the world.
[4091.64 → 4094.64] And more importantly, are proud to do so in your name.
[4094.64 → 4096.64] And your name alone.
[4096.64 → 4099.64] We come before you this morning to worship you.
[4099.64 → 4100.64] To praise you.
[4100.64 → 4101.64] To sing your name.
[4101.64 → 4103.64] And to give thanks for all you have done.
[4103.64 → 4106.64] Lord, give us everything we stand in need of.
[4106.64 → 4109.64] And guard us against everything we don't.
[4109.64 → 4111.64] May your kingdom come.
[4111.64 → 4113.64] And your will, not ours, be done.
[4113.64 → 4116.64] Only in the powerful name of Jesus.
[4116.64 → 4117.64] Amen.
[4117.64 → 4121.64] And I invite Pastor Jason back up to give us the benediction.
[4121.64 → 4122.64] And we'll close with our final song.
[4122.64 → 4136.64] Let's stand.
[4136.64 → 4140.64] And receive the benediction from the words of Jude.
[4140.64 → 4143.64] To him who is able to keep you from falling.
[4143.64 → 4146.64] And to present you before his glorious presence.
[4146.64 → 4149.64] Without fault and with great joy.
[4149.64 → 4154.64] To the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[4154.64 → 4157.64] Through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages.
[4157.64 → 4159.64] And now and forevermore.
[4159.64 → 4160.64] Amen.
[4160.64 → 4161.64] Athena.
