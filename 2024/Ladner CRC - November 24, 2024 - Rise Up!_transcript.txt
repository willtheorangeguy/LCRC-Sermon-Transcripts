[759.96 --> 761.96]  Thank you.
[761.96 --> 762.96]  Thank you.
[762.96 --> 770.70]  God's love and majesty, Mary and Lord sing,
[771.02 --> 777.48]  And to eternity, the land alone.
[792.96 --> 803.64]  You're the Word of God, His heart,
[803.64 --> 806.64]  Come before the Lord again,
[807.76 --> 810.64]  And His pure and every blood
[810.64 --> 814.64]  Has been fashioned by Your blood,
[815.04 --> 818.14]  All creation holds together
[818.14 --> 822.14]  By the power of the Lord,
[822.14 --> 825.72]  In the skies declare Your glory,
[826.24 --> 829.64]  In the land and seas rejoice,
[829.64 --> 832.98]  Through the honor of creation,
[833.66 --> 836.64]  You're the Lord of everyone,
[837.36 --> 840.16]  And You cry upon God,
[840.48 --> 842.68]  Across the land.
[848.20 --> 851.66]  Yet You left the gates of angels,
[852.14 --> 855.60]  Came to seek and save the lost,
[855.60 --> 859.18]  And You take the joy of the earth,
[859.64 --> 862.92]  For the angels of the cross,
[863.32 --> 866.48]  With the faithful and hungry,
[867.02 --> 870.44]  With the Lord and come to see,
[870.80 --> 873.80]  And the joy of the sovereign,
[874.40 --> 877.78]  And the gift You make us free,
[877.78 --> 881.24]  You're the honor of creation,
[881.24 --> 884.62]  You're the Lord of everyone,
[885.28 --> 889.70]  And You cry upon the grace of the cross,
[889.70 --> 890.70]  And the joy of the Lord,
[890.70 --> 893.16]  And the joy of the Lord,
[893.16 --> 895.16]  And the joy of the Lord,
[895.16 --> 897.20]  And the joy of the Lord,
[897.20 --> 900.26]  With the shadow of all victorious,
[900.26 --> 904.04]  Rest in kingdom of the grave,
[904.04 --> 907.70]  And descended into heaven,
[907.70 --> 911.40]  Meeting captives in Your way,
[911.40 --> 914.92]  Now You stand before the Father,
[914.92 --> 918.38]  In the city for the Lord,
[918.38 --> 920.38]  And the joy of the Lord,
[920.38 --> 922.38]  And You cry upon God,
[922.38 --> 924.38]  And You cry upon God,
[924.38 --> 926.38]  Across the land.
[926.38 --> 929.84]  You're the honor of creation,
[929.84 --> 933.84]  You're the Lord of everyone,
[933.84 --> 936.84]  And You cry upon God,
[936.84 --> 939.84]  Across the land.
[941.84 --> 944.84]  You're the honor of creation,
[944.84 --> 948.84]  You're the Lord of everyone,
[948.84 --> 951.84]  And You cry upon God,
[951.84 --> 954.72]  Across the land.
[956.38 --> 963.22]  You may be seated.
[971.22 --> 973.34]  Our Old Testament reading today,
[973.34 --> 976.02]  Which is related to our sermon,
[976.84 --> 978.26]  Is Psalm 2.
[978.52 --> 980.28]  It can be found in your pew Bible,
[980.28 --> 981.54]  On page 401.
[981.86 --> 983.42]  It will also be on the screen.
[984.44 --> 985.10]  Psalm 2.
[986.38 --> 990.18]  Why do the nations conspire,
[990.18 --> 992.42]  And the peoples plot in vain?
[992.42 --> 995.08]  The kings of the earth rise up,
[995.08 --> 997.04]  And the rulers band together,
[997.04 --> 998.24]  Against the Lord,
[998.24 --> 1000.14]  And against His anointed,
[1000.14 --> 1000.98]  Saying,
[1000.98 --> 1002.88]  Let us break their chains,
[1002.88 --> 1004.54]  And throw off their shackles.
[1005.34 --> 1007.92]  The one enthroned in heaven laughs.
[1008.60 --> 1010.12]  The Lord scoffs at them.
[1010.88 --> 1012.84]  He rebukes them in His anger,
[1013.34 --> 1015.50]  And terrifies them in His wrath,
[1015.50 --> 1016.00]  Saying,
[1016.00 --> 1019.26]  I have installed my king on Zion,
[1019.26 --> 1020.54]  My holy mountain.
[1021.30 --> 1023.52]  I will proclaim the Lord's decree.
[1024.42 --> 1025.42]  He said to me,
[1026.02 --> 1026.98]  You are my son.
[1027.70 --> 1029.68]  Today I have become your father.
[1030.84 --> 1031.70]  Ask me,
[1031.82 --> 1034.00]  And I will make the nations your inheritance,
[1034.54 --> 1036.96]  And the ends of the earth your possession.
[1037.96 --> 1040.24]  You will break them with a rod of iron.
[1040.24 --> 1042.66]  You will dash them to pieces like pottery.
[1043.92 --> 1045.02]  Therefore, you kings,
[1045.24 --> 1046.02]  Be wise.
[1046.70 --> 1048.80]  Be warned, you rulers of the earth.
[1049.74 --> 1051.54]  Serve the Lord with fear,
[1051.70 --> 1053.84]  And celebrate His rule with trembling.
[1054.92 --> 1055.92]  Kiss His son,
[1056.34 --> 1057.56]  Or He will be angry,
[1057.78 --> 1060.26]  And your way will lead to your destruction.
[1061.32 --> 1064.36]  For His wrath can flare up in a moment.
[1064.36 --> 1067.28]  Blessed are those,
[1067.76 --> 1070.08]  Are all who take refuge in Him.
[1074.16 --> 1077.78]  We begin our time of confession and assurance
[1077.78 --> 1080.40]  With this call to reconciliation.
[1083.82 --> 1085.86]  Rushed by the busyness of life,
[1087.16 --> 1089.44]  Weary from the stress of every day,
[1089.64 --> 1092.06]  We have these moments to catch our breath,
[1092.06 --> 1095.32]  To think of how we have treated others recently,
[1096.04 --> 1099.62]  To remember how we have not been God's faithful people.
[1100.54 --> 1102.10]  Let us come to God,
[1102.72 --> 1105.46]  Knowing that the one who listens to our words,
[1106.08 --> 1107.90]  Is the one who has given us,
[1108.34 --> 1110.54]  The word of grace and mercy.
[1113.82 --> 1115.74]  Join me in this prayer of confession,
[1116.08 --> 1119.60]  Reading the double arrowed sentences.
[1119.60 --> 1123.12]  Everlasting God,
[1123.20 --> 1124.60]  We know how easy it is
[1124.60 --> 1127.68]  To forget your presence and power in our lives.
[1128.66 --> 1130.38]  Focused on our daily planners,
[1130.90 --> 1132.26]  We do not pay attention
[1132.26 --> 1133.68]  To the night sky,
[1134.20 --> 1135.64]  And the stars that glitter.
[1137.62 --> 1140.02]  Surrounded by the sounds of anger,
[1140.44 --> 1142.06]  Violence, and hate,
[1142.60 --> 1144.36]  We have trouble listening
[1144.36 --> 1147.48]  To your whispers of hope and grace.
[1147.48 --> 1151.92]  Thinking that scripture is filled only with stories,
[1152.74 --> 1155.44]  We cannot understand your truth,
[1155.82 --> 1157.68]  But can change lives.
[1159.10 --> 1160.10]  Forgive us.
[1160.76 --> 1163.08]  There is no one who can hold a candle to you
[1163.08 --> 1165.20]  When it comes to mercy and hope.
[1166.50 --> 1169.42]  Lift us to our feet so that we may walk with you.
[1169.88 --> 1171.28]  Fill us with your strength,
[1171.70 --> 1173.38]  So that we may serve your people.
[1173.38 --> 1175.52]  Touch us with your healing,
[1175.84 --> 1178.52]  So that we may proclaim to everyone
[1178.52 --> 1181.54]  The good news that has come in Jesus Christ,
[1181.86 --> 1183.22]  Our Lord and Savior.
[1183.98 --> 1184.46]  Amen.
[1184.46 --> 1190.56]  And our assurance of pardon.
[1192.90 --> 1195.44]  The Lord is merciful and gracious,
[1195.74 --> 1198.74]  Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[1199.32 --> 1202.32]  He does not deal with us according to our sins,
[1202.82 --> 1205.86]  Nor repay us according to our iniquities.
[1206.50 --> 1209.24]  For as the heavens are high above the earth,
[1209.24 --> 1214.02]  So great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him.
[1214.68 --> 1217.42]  As far as the east is from the west,
[1218.10 --> 1221.28]  So far he removes our transgressions from us.
[1222.08 --> 1224.96]  As a father has compassion for his children,
[1225.70 --> 1229.60]  So the Lord has compassion for those who fear him.
[1229.60 --> 1232.94]  By God's mercy,
[1232.94 --> 1234.54]  We are forgiven.
[1235.12 --> 1236.78]  By God's mercy,
[1237.10 --> 1238.78]  We are made whole.
[1239.42 --> 1240.92]  By God's mercy,
[1241.24 --> 1244.00]  We are equipped to serve others.
[1244.74 --> 1246.12]  Thanks be to God.
[1246.70 --> 1247.20]  Amen.
[1248.32 --> 1249.76]  Let's sing of that mercy.
[1250.44 --> 1252.66]  There's a wideness to God's mercy.
[1254.14 --> 1255.64]  We will remain seated.
[1255.64 --> 1281.42]  There's a wideness in God's mercy,
[1281.42 --> 1285.38]  Like the wideness of the soul.
[1285.64 --> 1289.80]  There is a wideness in God's justice,
[1290.20 --> 1293.10]  Which is more than hate and liberty.
[1294.26 --> 1298.10]  There is no place where his souls
[1298.10 --> 1302.14]  Are more found than up in heaven.
[1302.54 --> 1306.36]  There is no place where his failings
[1306.36 --> 1310.12]  Not such work in judgment day.
[1310.12 --> 1320.46]  For the love and world is broader,
[1320.46 --> 1324.32]  And the widows of the world,
[1324.32 --> 1328.18]  And the heart of the eternal,
[1328.18 --> 1330.12]  His most wonderful,
[1330.12 --> 1332.30]  He kind.
[1332.74 --> 1334.40]  Make our love,
[1334.40 --> 1336.02]  O God more faithful,
[1336.02 --> 1340.46]  Let us take you and your word,
[1340.46 --> 1342.50]  And our lives,
[1342.56 --> 1344.32]  No mean that spirit,
[1344.74 --> 1348.36]  For the goodness of the Lord.
[1348.36 --> 1352.58]  Make our love,
[1352.58 --> 1354.10]  O God more faithful,
[1354.10 --> 1354.64]  Make our love,
[1354.64 --> 1355.92]  O God more faithful,
[1355.92 --> 1357.92]  Let us take you and your word,
[1357.92 --> 1359.92]  And our lives,
[1359.92 --> 1362.20]  We'll make thanks big,
[1362.20 --> 1366.50]  For the goodness of the Lord.
[1366.50 --> 1383.42]  And let us stand free.
[1383.92 --> 1402.20]  And the wurde of the last one,
[1403.94 --> 1408.74]  AndQuery with no sign of true,
[1408.74 --> 1438.72]  Thank you.
[1438.74 --> 1443.74]  Now I can admit me
[1443.74 --> 1452.74]  That you, my Lord, still have a tonne
[1452.74 --> 1460.74]  Now I can admit me
[1460.74 --> 1469.74]  That you, my Lord, still have a tonne
[1469.74 --> 1477.74]  Here, my Lord, still have a tonne
[1477.74 --> 1486.74]  So we, my Lord, still have a tonne

[1611.74 --> 1619.74]  The ACCAST
[1619.74 --> 1621.74]  Oh
[1649.74 --> 1651.74]  Oh
[1679.74 --> 1696.20]  At this time our Sunday school children are dismissed for their classes
[1696.20 --> 1710.70]  We are very happy to
[1712.14 --> 1716.26]  To have pastor norm been Eden Petersman with us today
[1717.40 --> 1725.12]  Norm pastor norm lives here in Ladner with his wife Roseanne and son Elliot who is a student at Delta Christian School
[1725.82 --> 1729.78]  He's pastored in reformed and Presbyterian congregations
[1729.78 --> 1735.04]  And he and his family are members of st. John's Richmond Anglican congregation
[1735.74 --> 1741.70]  He works for the nonprofit strong towns with community leaders and advocates
[1742.56 --> 1747.30]  advocates all across North America just a little note here
[1748.68 --> 1750.68]  Pastor Norm's wife Rosanna
[1750.68 --> 1757.24]  volunteers with BC and Alberta guide dog program and they are on their third
[1757.62 --> 1760.08]  guide dog training at home
[1761.80 --> 1763.80]  Also, I have to say that
[1764.80 --> 1766.80]  Norm was a
[1767.52 --> 1772.90]  Dorm mate of our son Colin and played hockey with him at Trinity Western University
[1772.90 --> 1774.90]  So we're kind of connected
[1775.14 --> 1777.14]  Welcome to our pulpit
[1783.86 --> 1789.06]  Good morning, it is good to be with you and it's a privilege to be able to take up God's Holy Word
[1789.54 --> 1791.64]  From Genesis chapter 11. I
[1792.38 --> 1795.02]  Will confess that I only know one language
[1795.02 --> 1803.50]  But it is fascinating to think about the diversification of languages and to give thought to the way in which the Lord has worked in history
[1804.00 --> 1809.92]  To make his will known and will continue to do so so let's turn together to Genesis chapter 11 starting at verse 1
[1811.40 --> 1816.10]  For we read according to God's Holy Word that he inspired the servant Moses to proclaim
[1816.10 --> 1821.04]  Now the whole world had one language and a common speech as
[1821.48 --> 1824.82]  Men moved eastward they found a plane in China and settled there
[1825.38 --> 1829.30]  They said to each other come let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly
[1829.92 --> 1833.58]  They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar
[1833.94 --> 1839.04]  Then they said come let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens
[1839.04 --> 1842.00]  So that we may make a name for ourselves
[1842.08 --> 1845.78]  And not be scattered over the face of the whole earth
[1846.94 --> 1852.08]  But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building the Lord said
[1852.64 --> 1856.70]  If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this
[1857.24 --> 1860.20]  Then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them
[1860.72 --> 1865.52]  Come let us come down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other
[1865.52 --> 1871.20]  So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth and they stopped building the city
[1872.08 --> 1874.08]  That is why it was called Babel
[1874.80 --> 1877.76]  Because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world
[1878.48 --> 1881.76]  From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth
[1883.20 --> 1886.48]  Let's come to the Lord asking for his blessing as we hear his word together
[1886.96 --> 1890.72]  O Lord our Father you who scattered peoples all over the world
[1890.72 --> 1896.16]  And yet in your covenant have promised to bring us together as one body in Christ
[1896.16 --> 1900.40]  We praise your holy name and we pray that you by the power of your holy spirit
[1900.88 --> 1903.28]  Would open our hearts to receive your word
[1903.84 --> 1906.80]  Spoken to us in the tongue that we can understand
[1907.44 --> 1911.76]  So that together Lord we might seek your name to be glorified above all
[1912.80 --> 1916.00]  Father would you give that we would not be moved to make a name for ourselves
[1916.00 --> 1920.88]  But rather take the name the name Christian the name Christ follower
[1921.36 --> 1925.92]  And be satisfied and delighted that you out of the abundance of your riches to us
[1926.48 --> 1929.36]  Have poured out upon us mercy love and grace
[1930.00 --> 1935.44]  And so father in the tongues that you have given to us give that we would be strengthened also through the power of your word
[1936.00 --> 1941.36]  To go forth as witnesses to all creation to every tribe nation and tongue
[1941.36 --> 1947.76]  To bear forth the mysteries of god and the wonders of salvation we pray this all in jesus name amen
[1952.24 --> 1955.04]  Well, this is an intriguing event
[1955.60 --> 1962.24]  Recorded in genesis chapter 11 on the plains of shinar, which is an area which is in modern day iraq
[1963.12 --> 1967.28]  It is set against in genesis chapter 9 and genesis chapter 6
[1967.28 --> 1975.04]  uh, the context there is of a global flood that the lord sets upon the world and and establishes after this flood event
[1975.76 --> 1976.56]  a covenant
[1977.20 --> 1981.28]  And the lord comes down to jesus 9 and says to noah. I will be with you
[1981.84 --> 1986.88]  But I will also be with the world that I've established. I will ensure that it endures
[1987.36 --> 1990.96]  Season after season after season to preserve it
[1990.96 --> 1994.88]  In spite of uh, the wickedness of humanity
[1995.44 --> 2002.80]  There is this problem that even uh in the immediate aftermath of this incredible moment in genesis 9 when the lord has delivered
[2003.36 --> 2009.76]  Noah and his family he's brought them out of the flood. He set them in his newly formed creation
[2011.20 --> 2013.20]  What happens?
[2013.36 --> 2014.56]  People happen
[2014.56 --> 2022.64]  Sin happens corruption happens and in this context the question is if this begins to build up and in the intensification here in genesis chapter 11
[2022.64 --> 2027.92]  If we begin to see an intensification of trouble in the world will the lord act?
[2028.08 --> 2031.60]  And will he change his mind with regards to the covenant that he had made?
[2032.64 --> 2036.56]  In the words of psalm 2 that we had read for us. What will the lord do?
[2037.28 --> 2040.24]  As the rulers plot against him and his anointed
[2040.96 --> 2043.84]  It's a very fraught moment here in the genesis story
[2044.56 --> 2050.64]  What's the lord going to do in response to this new outbreak of rebellion against him?
[2051.60 --> 2055.20]  The lord had cast out adam and eve from the garden in response to rebellion
[2055.84 --> 2061.04]  The lord had then further subjected the entire world to destruction on account of the rebellion that there was no
[2061.28 --> 2067.20]  Goodness in the hearts of men and now we're beginning to see the pattern repeat a third time and what it raises a question
[2068.00 --> 2072.88]  What does the lord do when the rulers of the world plot against him and his anointed?
[2072.88 --> 2079.92]  The pleasing aroma of the sacrifice of no one after he set foot on dry ground
[2080.48 --> 2084.64]  Is now replaced with the clamor of a building project in the east
[2085.20 --> 2089.52]  Of the smells of clay bricks being prepared to set a new course for the human race
[2090.32 --> 2092.16]  And this was to be a new way to live
[2092.16 --> 2099.28]  Which as always when it's a scheme of fallen sinners is set against god and his commandments to the people
[2100.00 --> 2103.76]  You can in one sense say there was no need for a new way to live for these people
[2103.76 --> 2106.40]  They should follow the way that the lord had set before them
[2107.52 --> 2111.28]  After all they had the testimony of noah they had the testimony of his children
[2111.44 --> 2114.80]  They had the remembrance as a people of what the lord had done
[2114.80 --> 2117.84]  How quickly do we forget don't we?
[2118.56 --> 2127.84]  How quickly in human hearts does a new idea set in in a way the lord had said uh twice be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth?
[2128.32 --> 2132.56]  And now the people say well, let us build let us make a name for ourselves and let us stop
[2133.20 --> 2136.88]  Going out into the rest of the world. Let's stop the dispersion that would happen here
[2137.68 --> 2139.04]  It's a pattern of rebellion
[2140.24 --> 2143.12]  We are instructed here of of another testimony though
[2143.76 --> 2147.44]  I mentioned the words of psalm 2 that the rulers take counsel together
[2147.92 --> 2152.56]  Let us burst their bonds apart. Let us cast away their cords from us. They say
[2153.44 --> 2154.40]  And then verse 4
[2155.12 --> 2160.48]  He who sits in the heavens laughs and the lord holds them in derision
[2161.76 --> 2165.76]  That's where I think in this story there's there is a moment of humor
[2167.04 --> 2171.52]  There's a moment of humor that perhaps even still ripples into the times where we've had
[2172.00 --> 2175.28]  Unwitting misunderstandings of each other because of language barriers
[2176.24 --> 2179.28]  I grew up in a dutch household my parents did speak english in the home
[2179.28 --> 2183.36]  But there was always these weird sayings that my mom had picked up in english
[2183.36 --> 2186.64]  But didn't quite get right and and there would be some hilarity out of it
[2186.72 --> 2191.36]  And I think we can almost apply a little bit of that hilarity to what's happening here in genesis 11
[2191.36 --> 2197.92]  Because here together we have this scene that is is set before us in verses 1 and 2
[2198.48 --> 2201.76]  That'll be the opening of our sermon here that the scene gets set
[2202.32 --> 2206.08]  And and the lord is giving us so much more than just a morality tale here
[2206.88 --> 2211.20]  This is a serious event even if there is a humorous undertone to it
[2211.76 --> 2213.76]  There's a lasting impact isn't there?
[2213.76 --> 2220.32]  Uh, there's a lasting presence of of this rebellion that still permeates the region and the world over and over again
[2220.72 --> 2225.44]  Because even this very site babel is known through scripture by another name
[2226.32 --> 2226.88]  babylon
[2227.92 --> 2232.24]  It is the great ancient city that rises and falls and rises again
[2232.64 --> 2238.48]  That great city that serves as this all-encompassing phrase to describe all the cities of the world
[2238.48 --> 2246.88]  Whenever a city's hearts are set against the lord or a people's hearts are set against the lord. They are described in scripture as babel
[2248.56 --> 2249.68]  As enemies of god
[2251.20 --> 2253.28]  And so let's look at its roots
[2254.32 --> 2256.32]  Let's look at the roots here
[2256.64 --> 2261.20]  The ancient babylonians believed that the word babylon meant the gate of the god
[2262.16 --> 2266.72]  They would proclaim that their city was created by the gods at the beginning of time
[2266.72 --> 2270.64]  And that it was a scene of special contact with the gods
[2271.52 --> 2273.92]  And so you can imagine if you were a hebrew boy or girl
[2274.40 --> 2277.52]  Talking with a babylonian you would come home and ask your parents
[2278.16 --> 2283.68]  Is it true that babylon is a city that has always existed because it was made by the gods?
[2284.88 --> 2286.88]  And the response would be
[2286.88 --> 2287.68]  Nope
[2287.68 --> 2289.52]  It's a city like every other
[2290.24 --> 2295.92]  It's built with human hands and sweat. It's built with brick and bitumen by people
[2296.72 --> 2300.80]  It's not some magic thing. It's not some wonderful. It just is a city
[2301.36 --> 2304.08]  A thing that has been constructed and what's more
[2304.64 --> 2308.88]  There's no way to contact god apart from his revelation of himself to us
[2308.88 --> 2312.40]  And so the lord is correcting so many categories of thought here
[2313.44 --> 2318.40]  When the people came from the east we read that they found a plain in shinar and settled there
[2319.04 --> 2323.52]  So they're moving from the mountains of ararat. They're now spreading out. They're wandering again
[2324.08 --> 2328.16]  And they've come to a plain with rivers to provide life-sustaining water
[2328.72 --> 2331.84]  And they decide to build a city and and that can be just fine
[2332.56 --> 2338.40]  It's a good idea to build cities. We see in genesis 4 the establishment of cities are beginning to be places of refuge
[2338.96 --> 2343.20]  There's a need for us to be able to gather together to live in harmony together
[2343.60 --> 2349.20]  If we are created for a garden we are destined for a great city which makes us all urbanists at heart
[2350.16 --> 2357.04]  And in this context, the question is interesting here in verse 1 the whole earth had one language and the same words
[2358.24 --> 2360.24]  Now, how would they use this?
[2360.56 --> 2362.56]  Couldn't this be a blessing?
[2363.20 --> 2365.44]  I face the effects of language confusion quite a bit
[2366.08 --> 2372.56]  It's led to a lot of frustration miscommunication assumptions of meaning there's even stories of people misunderstanding key
[2373.92 --> 2379.44]  Communiques and starting wars on account of of not fully understanding what the message was in translation
[2380.32 --> 2384.08]  And so wouldn't it be nice could you imagine to have one language?
[2385.36 --> 2386.96]  But we're still waiting for that day
[2386.96 --> 2394.72]  For here they hatch a plan that they are going to make a name for themselves and an eternal city
[2394.96 --> 2397.36]  Come let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly
[2398.00 --> 2404.08]  Moses is writing here and and so it raises the question is Babylon an eternal city? No, it's it's built like every other
[2405.44 --> 2411.20]  But then I was interested by the next part notice in the next verse. It seems almost like this unnecessary detail
[2411.20 --> 2416.80]  But we all know that with god there is no unnecessary detail in his word, right?
[2417.84 --> 2420.80]  They had brick for stone and bitumen for mortar
[2422.00 --> 2424.00]  Do you know what that is?
[2424.24 --> 2425.28]  It's a bit of a jab
[2426.48 --> 2431.28]  It's it's it's for the israelites to understand that even this was a second-class building
[2431.92 --> 2435.68]  In israel, they had an abundance of stone and ingredients for mortar
[2435.68 --> 2439.76]  They could build better buildings with the resource that they had on hand
[2440.56 --> 2441.76]  But these folks have to use
[2443.44 --> 2446.16]  Brick that they're having to labor at and tar
[2447.04 --> 2447.52]  Bitumen
[2448.32 --> 2455.36]  Instead of having proper mortar stone and mortar was superior to brick and tar and which was all that they had available to them in the land of
[2455.36 --> 2457.36]  Shinar
[2457.60 --> 2461.36]  So you can imagine not only is your city not handed down from the gods
[2461.36 --> 2463.84]  It's also kind of second-rate
[2464.96 --> 2465.92]  Not so special
[2466.64 --> 2468.64]  He who sits in the heavens laughs
[2469.52 --> 2475.60]  Because up goes the city and its tower they they claim let us build ourselves a city in a tower with its top in the heavens
[2475.92 --> 2480.08]  Let us make a name for ourselves lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth
[2480.88 --> 2482.32]  It's quite a building project
[2483.12 --> 2485.92]  You can imagine how much ingenuity wisdom
[2485.92 --> 2491.36]  Uh insight intelligence has to go into doing anything that gets above several stories
[2492.24 --> 2498.96]  All of our builders in in the latter area know what it is to to build significant projects and know that the cost that comes as you
[2498.96 --> 2502.00]  Continue to add the height and reckon with what's going on
[2503.04 --> 2507.20]  But here they say this city will keep us together. It will be a tower into the heavens
[2507.20 --> 2514.32]  It'll be our entryway into the heavens and it'll serve us as this great powerful name. We will be famous
[2516.72 --> 2520.80]  In isaiah chapter 14 verse 13 we hear this of the king of babylon
[2521.68 --> 2523.04]  You said in your heart
[2523.60 --> 2524.88]  I will ascend to heaven
[2525.76 --> 2528.88]  Above the stars of god. I will set my throne on high
[2529.60 --> 2535.84]  I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds
[2536.24 --> 2538.56]  I will make myself like the most high
[2540.40 --> 2542.80]  This could be the biography of these men couldn't it
[2542.80 --> 2545.76]  Those words there in isaiah chapter 14
[2546.88 --> 2549.12]  It's a an affliction of the babylonian heart
[2549.84 --> 2554.72]  To want to be higher than god above the stars of god to set my throne on high
[2556.48 --> 2563.04]  The kings of the city claim over and over this claim and yet they space setback after setback
[2563.04 --> 2567.12]  But no human plan can survive contact with god
[2567.68 --> 2568.64]  in tact
[2569.76 --> 2572.32]  There could be no way of escaping what the lord will do here
[2573.20 --> 2574.96]  But these people try it on their own way
[2575.92 --> 2580.40]  And now the israelites are told what they too should expect if they turn from the living god
[2581.28 --> 2588.56]  There's a warning here in genesis 11 that the lord's people would ignore at various times think of solomon in his quest to have the greatest kingdom
[2588.56 --> 2591.60]  And and it coming to nothing for him and his descendants
[2592.56 --> 2596.32]  But here's the here's the flaws of just this project. It's just a human building
[2596.80 --> 2598.56]  It's not the gateway to the gods
[2599.36 --> 2604.48]  It's made with brick and with with stone and has its own fragility because of the conditions it's made in
[2605.36 --> 2608.96]  It's been made also you could say with the flimsiest of motives
[2608.96 --> 2612.96]  To make a name for ourselves and stop the command to fill the earth
[2613.60 --> 2616.88]  And then verse 5 the lord came down to see the city
[2617.92 --> 2622.40]  The lord we read came down to see the city in the tower which the children of man had built
[2623.68 --> 2630.48]  This is a an expression of what god had to do that from the heaven he can barely make out what's going on
[2631.68 --> 2635.28]  It's so in infinitesimally small that he's like well
[2635.28 --> 2642.64]  I must and and this is a vivid description of the lord saying I had to come down before I had a chance to even see this great thing
[2643.20 --> 2644.96]  This supposedly incredible
[2645.68 --> 2646.64]  Feet
[2646.64 --> 2654.16]  It it was so not on my radar that I had to come make a significant trip had to go closer get closer and closer and closer
[2657.44 --> 2661.36]  My son said I dad I built a giant sandcastle
[2663.04 --> 2664.24]  It was just that tall
[2665.28 --> 2666.40]  It's a good work keep it up
[2666.40 --> 2669.52]  But you've got a ways to go before you really fill out the idea of it being giant
[2669.68 --> 2673.60]  That's this idea that god is not obvious. You know, he's not constrained by time or space
[2674.16 --> 2676.16]  He knows what's going on
[2676.24 --> 2681.04]  But the people are being shown that the lord is is coming down now for an inspection from afar
[2682.08 --> 2683.92]  So have they succeeded not at all
[2684.80 --> 2686.80]  They're a long ways off from heaven
[2688.00 --> 2691.04]  And yet the lord does say something that puzzles us
[2691.04 --> 2696.96]  Behold they are one people and that of all one language and this is only the beginning of what they will do
[2697.44 --> 2700.80]  And nothing that they propose to do now will be impossible for them
[2701.60 --> 2703.76]  Also now we we really take no
[2704.56 --> 2706.16]  Huh
[2706.16 --> 2709.44]  God is making a statement in his holy council
[2710.00 --> 2717.60]  That the strength of those who rise up against him will increase so that what they propose to do will now no longer be impossible
[2718.72 --> 2723.20]  Now let's set something straight god has authority over all of mankind
[2724.32 --> 2728.72]  But because of his creation of us there is much that we are capable of
[2728.72 --> 2735.76]  And god is highlighting here in genesis 11 this human ingenuity and capacity for creation
[2736.72 --> 2746.00]  Which we are to use well as the lord commands us to multiply and fill the earth to to have a rule and and responsibility for everything in this creation
[2746.80 --> 2748.00]  To use gifts well
[2749.28 --> 2751.28]  But here we see the opposite
[2751.36 --> 2754.88]  This is a rebellion against god of rebellion in the heart
[2754.88 --> 2759.20]  And before the flood we've been told that every inclination of the heart was evil
[2759.84 --> 2763.84]  And now we're told there's no telling what they will be able to do and so god acts
[2765.60 --> 2769.68]  He is about to break up this power and disrupt this unholy alliance against him
[2770.64 --> 2772.88]  And is it because it's actually a threat to him?
[2774.08 --> 2778.32]  Well, no, because a world dominated by the people of the east of shinar
[2779.12 --> 2780.64]  Would not be a threat to the lord
[2781.76 --> 2784.24]  But as we see through the story of genesis
[2784.88 --> 2788.16]  This tracing out of the lineage of the people of god
[2788.72 --> 2791.36]  It is they who would fall into harm's way
[2792.00 --> 2799.28]  It is they who would fall into harm's way in babel or later in babylon as the lord would even use this people in this community
[2799.76 --> 2802.24]  To enact judgment against his people but in this instance
[2802.96 --> 2808.48]  He acts to protect his people those who call on the name of the lord and bear his name
[2809.20 --> 2814.96]  From the tyranny of a single empire stretching throughout the region bearing a false religion and false pride
[2816.08 --> 2822.48]  And so the lord commands come let us go down and there confuse the language so that they may not understand one another's speech
[2823.84 --> 2827.52]  It's fascinating. He had promised to never again destroy the earth with a flood
[2827.52 --> 2829.76]  So now he uses a new tool
[2830.64 --> 2831.20]  A tongue
[2832.48 --> 2838.48]  Mixing up between people the languages so that there would be the spread of confusion
[2838.48 --> 2847.20]  And are we gripped in this by the authority and and the creativity and the power of god over all things?
[2849.76 --> 2852.40]  Do we see his power and marvel at his wisdom?
[2852.96 --> 2855.76]  Over all things does this move us to worship him?
[2856.48 --> 2862.40]  Using the language that we have to to give god the glory lest we try to make a name for ourselves
[2862.40 --> 2868.32]  You see the quest to make a name for yourself is is not a christian quest
[2869.28 --> 2877.36]  It actually betrays the name that we take at baptism at the baptism of a christian. We are baptized as not I but christ in me
[2878.16 --> 2880.40]  We take another's name as our own
[2881.28 --> 2882.40]  I am of christ
[2882.96 --> 2888.24]  I belong to christ and that is my identity that is my sufficiency that is my power
[2888.24 --> 2890.24]  That is my legacy
[2893.20 --> 2900.00]  And we're being corrected here aren't we warned against neglecting god's commands and turning from his point path of mediation
[2901.20 --> 2905.44]  Because here we come to our final point of the dispersion and its effects
[2906.16 --> 2909.68]  Verse 8 there's something so wonderfully succinct about this
[2910.48 --> 2912.48]  They left off building the city
[2913.12 --> 2915.12]  God halted their progress and they were done
[2915.12 --> 2921.84]  God does what he says and it will bring about the consequence that he says it shall
[2923.36 --> 2926.08]  And later generations would try to come back to the site of babel
[2926.40 --> 2934.56]  They would construct the ancient city of babylon with its hanging gardens its architectural masterpieces much later the israelites themselves would have to go there
[2935.12 --> 2937.12]  The place would loom large
[2937.36 --> 2944.40]  The apostle john in the apocalypse sees in babylon as I said the epitome of all the cities of the world allied against god
[2945.68 --> 2948.72]  Yet in genesis 11 we're told this is not a city from the gods
[2948.88 --> 2954.24]  This is not a city built even with superior methods and this is not a city that will endure
[2954.88 --> 2958.16]  It is a city that can be easily disrupted if the lord wills
[2959.12 --> 2962.72]  It is a plan that can be easily disrupted if the lord wills
[2963.76 --> 2969.76]  For any who harbor in their heart rebellion against the lord the lord says know this it will come to nothing
[2969.76 --> 2975.12]  But to those who trust in the lord to those who turn back to the lord it
[2975.84 --> 2978.24]  Becomes life it becomes fullness doesn't it?
[2980.80 --> 2986.56]  What does the lord say in isaiah chapter 14 verse 22 we I will rise up against them
[2986.96 --> 2992.48]  Speaking of the babylonians declares the lord of hosts and will cut off from babylon name and remnant
[2992.96 --> 2994.16]  descendants and posterity
[2994.64 --> 2999.84]  I will make it a possession of the hedgehog and pools of water and I will sweep it with the boom
[3000.40 --> 3003.28]  broom of destruction declares the lord of hosts
[3005.28 --> 3008.88]  I don't know what it is to be made the possession of the hedgehog, but it can't be glamorous
[3009.60 --> 3016.40]  It certainly feels like the opposite of having a grand spectacular tower and just the most impressive
[3016.96 --> 3020.64]  resume as tower construction city construction people
[3022.80 --> 3030.72]  It's interesting that the act of god to stir up the common language into its many splinters and dialects and tongues of many kind is is traced back to this
[3031.60 --> 3035.84]  The years continue to roll on after the flood and there's no hint of renewal
[3035.84 --> 3040.56]  There's actually no sign of a breakthrough things are only getting worse
[3041.12 --> 3047.36]  And and now the lord gives what really looks like a mixed blessing of languages of many kinds
[3048.32 --> 3052.00]  On the one hand it prevents total apostasy and rebellion against god
[3052.80 --> 3057.12]  But it also makes everyday interactions with people in other languages that much harder
[3058.24 --> 3061.52]  One way to look at it is that it adds a diversity to our struggle
[3061.52 --> 3066.32]  And it gives us a perspective on the lord's continued work in this world
[3068.48 --> 3072.00]  I met some very fearful people in my work in pastoral ministry
[3072.88 --> 3075.84]  We're especially vaxxed about prospects of you know
[3075.84 --> 3081.52]  They read the newspapers and everything seems to be a sign of one global government that they're very fearful of
[3082.88 --> 3088.88]  And I laid before them this text and said we need not fear even if there were some global world superpower
[3088.88 --> 3094.08]  With the strength to rule and the power to do what they proposed even in that situation god intervenes
[3094.80 --> 3097.92]  God has might god has done this time and time again
[3098.96 --> 3105.04]  Sometimes people assume that it's a fate a complete like that it is just it's going to happen. We're all doomed
[3105.28 --> 3110.56]  It's going to be the worst and yet. What is the lord shown time and time and time again that there is always a people
[3110.56 --> 3112.24]  There is always a path forward
[3112.24 --> 3117.12]  There is always in the lord's gifts the things that we need in the time that we need it
[3118.16 --> 3120.88]  And what's more out of the masses of the human race?
[3121.20 --> 3124.96]  The lord uses many tongues to bring the word of faith which we proclaim
[3126.08 --> 3130.08]  God is in this sense the great undoer of what's wrong
[3131.28 --> 3138.16]  And at pentecost in particular we see such vivid expression of this because at pentecost in act in the in the book of acts
[3138.16 --> 3146.96]  What do we read that everyone in their own tongue heard what the lord had done heard the testimony of god's people heard and believed and marveled
[3146.96 --> 3150.16]  They said the lord is communicating to us in our tongue
[3151.20 --> 3158.72]  To tell us of his name and the one in whom we shall be named and the one through whom good gifts come similarly in the great commission
[3158.72 --> 3160.96]  The lord jesus says go out everywhere
[3161.60 --> 3165.20]  And this is so consistent with what paul reminds us in first corinthians 10
[3165.20 --> 3168.56]  He says we who are many are one body
[3169.52 --> 3170.40]  We are many
[3170.40 --> 3178.40]  Many tongues many places many different backgrounds many different needs, but we are one body for we all partake of the one bread
[3179.12 --> 3184.40]  And this is woven into the work that the lord does to even undo the consequences of babel
[3185.12 --> 3188.24]  In the life of the christian church to overcome rebellion
[3188.24 --> 3193.12]  So that we no longer kick against the lord but instead submit to him
[3193.60 --> 3198.00]  To give us a name rather than us having to make a name for ourselves. I am christian
[3198.56 --> 3200.00]  I am of christ
[3201.12 --> 3203.68]  And then third to remove barriers
[3204.56 --> 3211.92]  Barriers of custom and tradition are broken down for the traditional hostility between jew and gentile of old to be transcended
[3211.92 --> 3213.76]  But even any hostilities today
[3214.48 --> 3216.48]  So that the lord would equip the saints
[3216.48 --> 3218.96]  And so how
[3219.68 --> 3221.20]  Then do we respond
[3222.16 --> 3225.12]  We can ask ourselves who do we serve and what is our ambition?
[3226.16 --> 3232.96]  Remember you serve the god who holds the waters in his hands who says to the waves this far you shall come and no further
[3233.84 --> 3241.44]  You serve the lord who chose for himself a chosen people a holy priesthood out of every language and people of this world
[3241.44 --> 3249.12]  And you serve the father who protects his church and this created world through this time of anticipation
[3249.92 --> 3253.12]  Even as you long for all things to may be made new
[3254.24 --> 3257.68]  For no human constraint can block us from that presence of god
[3258.16 --> 3261.92]  No human construct can shortcut the way to the lord's right hand
[3261.92 --> 3267.84]  No human building can give us power to rise up against god and see him face to face as equals
[3270.88 --> 3275.60]  For in christ we are a new creation in english here we say this but in many tongues
[3275.60 --> 3280.00]  On this day around the world the message goes out in christ
[3280.00 --> 3287.92]  We are a new creation in christ. We are new construction in christ. We are new edifice a people a body a temple
[3289.12 --> 3291.84]  Greater than anything that the human mind could have conceived
[3291.84 --> 3296.24]  Not some rinky-dink tower in shinar
[3297.28 --> 3300.80]  We're a temple a construction of the lord himself
[3301.76 --> 3305.36]  This is where isaiah. I mean the prophecy of zephaniah rings out
[3306.08 --> 3310.32]  Expecting that I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech
[3311.04 --> 3314.88]  That all of them may call upon the name of the lord and serve him with one accord
[3315.68 --> 3321.36]  From beyond the rivers of cush that is in central africa my worshipers the daughter of my dispersed ones
[3321.36 --> 3328.32]  Shall bring my offering and there it was represented from there and from there from beyond the rivers from beyond these spaces
[3329.20 --> 3331.20]  And that work continues
[3332.00 --> 3334.96]  Where we know that we are called to watch with the lord
[3335.84 --> 3337.84]  When humanity says we will rise up
[3338.56 --> 3346.16]  Believers understand this is no threat to the order of the world and the place of god in our lives when humanity says rise up and become gods
[3346.16 --> 3351.04]  We have history to turn to in order to see that this is the way of falling
[3351.76 --> 3355.12]  The plotting of scoffers who will come to nothing by divine appointment
[3355.84 --> 3360.16]  When the world says we have a new way to guard ourselves against the commands of god
[3360.96 --> 3365.28]  We have the testimony of his word to show us how vain and wrong that idea is
[3366.40 --> 3369.60]  So serve the lord your god take his name upon yourself
[3369.60 --> 3376.24]  Serve him knowing that no city no tower no vantage point in the heavens can give you what you desire
[3377.36 --> 3378.40]  Only christ can
[3379.36 --> 3386.24]  And as the psalmist closes psalm 2 we close this morning serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling
[3386.88 --> 3391.76]  Kiss the son lest he be angry and you perish in the way for his wrath is quickly kindled
[3393.28 --> 3394.08]  But blessed
[3394.08 --> 3397.36]  Blessed are all who take refuge in him
[3398.48 --> 3399.04]  Amen
[3404.72 --> 3405.12]  Let us
[3409.60 --> 3410.00]  Sing
[3410.80 --> 3416.08]  My hope is built on nothing less. I was looking for a song about building and this one
[3416.72 --> 3420.80]  The lord will lay on our hearts just how good it is that he is our hope and our strength
[3424.08 --> 3425.44]  Veiders
[3425.44 --> 3440.40] жigi
[3440.40 --> 3442.64]  say
[3442.96 --> 3445.20]  Please
[3445.20 --> 3449.76]  God is His God in righteousness
[3449.76 --> 3454.30]  God in the trust of sin and sin
[3454.30 --> 3459.58]  God in the name of Jesus Christ
[3459.58 --> 3465.40]  God is the Son of Christ in the world
[3465.40 --> 3468.72]  God in the name of sin and sin
[3468.72 --> 3474.32]  God in the name of sin and sin
[3474.32 --> 3479.64]  When I was filled with His loving grace
[3479.64 --> 3484.00]  I was the nation of unchanging grace
[3484.00 --> 3488.14]  In every fire and shining air
[3488.14 --> 3493.14]  My angels take Him away
[3493.14 --> 3498.44]  God is the star of hope to stand
[3498.44 --> 3502.70]  Oh, I will now be the stinking soul
[3502.70 --> 3508.02]  All of the mountains to His land
[3508.02 --> 3514.12]  He took His blood and His blood
[3514.12 --> 3518.64]  So the people of Him fly
[3518.64 --> 3522.82]  In all the mountains to the day
[3522.82 --> 3527.70]  He did His love and hope to stay
[3527.70 --> 3533.02]  God is the star of hope to stay
[3533.02 --> 3538.34]  No other love is the star of hope to stay
[3538.34 --> 3544.34]  No other love is the star of hope to stay
[3544.34 --> 3549.66]  Where He shall bow and hope to stay
[3549.66 --> 3554.98]  Oh, I will now be the star of hope to stay
[3554.98 --> 3556.94]  Oh, I just am glad
[3556.94 --> 3560.88]  O, I'm best.
[3560.94 --> 3563.30]  Amen.
[3563.30 --> 3571.06]  Oh, I will now be the star of hope to stay
[3571.20 --> 3573.28]  There who may be the star of hope to stay
[3573.40 --> 3574.98]  Your stars to see
[3575.36 --> 3579.86]  Hard with his love and hope to stay
[3579.86 --> 3600.22]  And because of that solid rock on which we stand, we are able to give our offerings this morning for Resonate Global Mission.
[3600.22 --> 3610.18]  We are particularly giving this offering to the Umrans. Najee Umran and his wife Ann Zaki serve in Cairo.
[3611.64 --> 3620.66]  Najee is the regional mission leader for all of the Middle East for Resonate Global Missions.
[3620.66 --> 3638.00]  And Ann Zaki teaches practical theology and preaching at the Cairo Evangelical and Presbyterian Theological Seminary.
[3638.22 --> 3638.64]  That's right.
[3639.64 --> 3640.26]  All right.
[3640.36 --> 3642.00]  So we'd like to give our offerings now.
