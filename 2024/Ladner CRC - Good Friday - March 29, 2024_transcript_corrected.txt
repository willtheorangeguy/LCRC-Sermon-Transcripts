[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 212.00] Thank you.
[212.00 → 213.86] Welcome to this Good Friday service.
[213.86 → 234.54] We call this day Good Friday because the Good and Holy One, our Lord Jesus Christ, on this day willingly offered up his life as a pure and perfect sacrifice for those who were not good.
[234.54 → 264.54] 
[264.54 → 294.52] And are raised to life.
[294.52 → 295.52] And are raised to life.
[295.52 → 296.52] And are raised to life.
[296.52 → 297.52] And are raised to life.
[297.52 → 304.40] In that same spirit, we invite you to make use of the stations of the cross that you can see around the sanctuary.
[304.40 → 311.40] Each one narrowing in on a unique event in Jesus' journey to the cross.
[311.40 → 314.40] We invite you to view those after the service.
[314.40 → 321.40] For our service this morning, we will be reading from scripture from all four gospels.
[321.40 → 325.40] There will be also some dramatic readings and songs.
[325.40 → 337.40] When we are finished, we will depart in silence and in reverence of our Lord as we continue to reflect on his death for us.
[337.40 → 339.40] We will begin our time of prayer.
[339.40 → 343.40] We will begin our time of worship with a word of prayer.
[343.40 → 344.40] Would you please join me in prayer?
[344.40 → 352.40] Heavenly Father, you gave your only-begotten son for us.
[352.40 → 359.40] We worship you.
[359.40 → 366.40] Lord Jesus, in your death, we have life.
[366.40 → 369.40] We worship you.
[369.40 → 383.40] Holy Spirit, we ask that you would continue to illumine in our hearts the work of our Saviour, that we might know your love more and more.
[383.40 → 388.40] We worship you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[388.40 → 390.40] Amen.
[390.40 → 395.40] So please stand for our first song this morning.
[395.40 → 403.40] And then after we sing this first song, you may be seated, and you can remain seated for the rest of the service.
[403.40 → 424.40] Jesus Christ, I thank them all your sacrifice.

[453.40 → 460.40] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I've broken inside.
[461.40 → 467.40] Once again I thank you, once again I've broken inside.
[473.40 → 478.40] Now you are exalted to the highest voice,
[478.40 → 484.40] King of the heavens, and will be above.
[485.40 → 490.40] But for now I'm he artful at this sacred,
[491.40 → 495.40] And I will all praise once again.
[496.40 → 501.40] I will all praise once again.
[502.40 → 507.40] Once again I'll lift all the cross for you now.
[508.40 → 514.40] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I've broken inside.
[515.40 → 521.40] Once again I thank you, once again I've broken inside.
[521.40 → 536.40] Thank you for the cross, thank you for the cross, I appreciate the cross my friend.
[536.40 → 551.40] Thank you for the cross, I appreciate the cross, I appreciate the cross my friend.
[551.40 → 563.40] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I've broken inside.
[563.40 → 567.40] Once again I thank you, once again I've broken inside.
[567.40 → 569.40] Once again I've broken inside.
[569.40 → 571.40] Thanks for the cross Niners I've broken inside.
[573.40 → 574.40] Eventually I envy you all
[575.40 → 581.40] with me and you with him to look at the cross.
[581.40 → 607.50] Now the festival of unleavened bread, called the Passover, was approaching.
[607.50 → 617.42] And the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
[618.64 → 624.22] Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the twelve.
[625.64 → 634.38] And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
[634.38 → 639.60] They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
[640.84 → 649.52] He consented and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
[649.52 → 665.34] When I first joined Jesus and his disciples, it was exciting.
[666.28 → 670.02] The crowds were following, hanging on to his every word.
[670.02 → 672.72] He did such incredible things.
[673.58 → 682.92] Healings, casting out demons, feeding huge crowds with just a small lunch, even raising the dead.
[683.56 → 684.74] It was amazing.
[685.84 → 688.16] But slowly things are changing.
[688.16 → 693.06] Oh, Jesus still demonstrates his power in different ways.
[693.66 → 695.90] But for me, it's almost getting old.
[696.74 → 701.84] And just lately, there's a lot of grumbling and plotting among the Jewish rulers and teachers.
[703.00 → 706.34] Jesus is stealing their thunder, and it's getting a bit scary.
[707.76 → 709.86] Maybe it's time for me to bail.
[709.86 → 714.84] Maybe I can help the establishment capture the master.
[715.74 → 717.34] For a fee, of course.
[717.98 → 721.88] Because I'll need to devise a plan to carry on with the rest of my life.
[722.50 → 725.60] I'll need something to sustain me until I figure it out.
[725.60 → 726.60] Amen.
[726.60 → 727.60] Amen.
[755.60 → 777.38] When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve.
[778.38 → 783.04] While they were reclining at the table eating, he said,
[783.04 → 791.02] Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.
[792.30 → 796.50] They were saddened, and one by one they said to him,
[797.12 → 798.76] Surely you don't mean me.
[800.22 → 806.90] It is one of the twelve, he replied, one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
[808.30 → 812.50] The Son of Man will go, just as it is written about him.
[813.04 → 817.36] But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man.
[817.86 → 821.10] It would be better for him if he had not been born.
[821.10 → 826.96] While they were eating, Jesus took bread.
[827.68 → 830.24] And when he had given thanks, he broke it,
[830.66 → 833.48] and gave it to his disciples, saying,
[834.10 → 837.24] Take it, this is my body.
[837.24 → 840.58] Then he took a cup.
[840.58 → 846.08] And when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
[846.80 → 852.18] This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many, he said to them.
[852.18 → 860.56] Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day,
[860.92 → 863.74] when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
[865.18 → 871.04] When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
[871.04 → 887.32] witness song
[887.32 → 917.30] . . .
[917.32 → 947.30] . . .
[947.32 → 949.32] . . .
[977.32 → 980.32] . . .
[980.32 → 981.32] . . .
[981.32 → 983.32] . . .
[983.32 → 994.58] Voices made of music, till we live in the peace of God.
[1006.62 → 1010.64] You will all fall away, Jesus told them.
[1010.64 → 1017.04] For it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.
[1018.26 → 1023.34] But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
[1024.74 → 1029.62] Peter declared, even if all fall away, I will not.
[1031.00 → 1036.34] Truly I tell you, Jesus answered, today, yes, tonight,
[1036.34 → 1043.30] before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will disown me three times.
[1044.28 → 1049.12] But Peter insisted emphatically, even if I have to die with you,
[1049.20 → 1051.10] I will never disown you.
[1052.04 → 1055.24] And all the others said the same.
[1055.24 → 1067.12] Impossible.
[1068.70 → 1073.24] Since the day Jesus miraculously filled our fishing nets to the point of breaking,
[1073.80 → 1077.54] and then invited me to follow him, I've never looked back.
[1078.54 → 1080.78] He is the one, the Messiah.
[1080.78 → 1083.40] I could never denounce him.
[1084.36 → 1085.66] He is everything.
[1086.82 → 1090.00] I would die before I would deny being one of his chosen.
[1090.86 → 1093.38] I'm blessed and proud to be in his circle.
[1095.90 → 1098.20] How can he say that I will deny him?
[1099.46 → 1099.98] Never.
[1099.98 → 1100.08] Never.
[1100.08 → 1100.10] Never.
[1110.78 → 1113.28] They went to a place called Gethsemane.
[1114.36 → 1118.22] And Jesus said to his disciples, sit here while I pray.
[1119.36 → 1123.70] He took Peter, James, and John along with him.
[1124.20 → 1127.46] And he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
[1127.46 → 1135.16] My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death, he said to them.
[1135.94 → 1137.80] Stay here and keep watch.
[1138.96 → 1146.72] Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him.
[1147.64 → 1152.98] Abba, Father, he said, everything is possible for you.
[1152.98 → 1155.00] Take this cup for me.
[1155.00 → 1159.38] Yet not what I will, but what you will.
[1160.60 → 1165.60] Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.
[1166.90 → 1170.58] Simon, he said to Peter, are you asleep?
[1171.68 → 1174.10] Couldn't you keep watch for one hour?
[1175.30 → 1179.24] Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
[1179.78 → 1183.88] The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
[1185.00 → 1189.08] Once again, he went away and prayed the same thing.
[1190.14 → 1196.74] When he came back, he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.
[1196.74 → 1200.72] They did not know what to say to him.
[1202.36 → 1207.14] Returning the third time, he said to them, are you still sleeping and resting?
[1208.10 → 1208.64] Enough.
[1209.12 → 1210.36] The hour has come.
[1211.52 → 1216.84] Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
[1216.84 → 1219.48] Rise, let us go.
[1219.48 → 1222.96] Here comes my betrayer.
[1222.96 → 1237.60] We have an evening meal and walk to Gethsemane.
[1239.04 → 1243.50] Jesus asks us to stay while he goes off a bit further into the olive grove.
[1243.50 → 1247.02] We are to watch and pray with him.
[1248.16 → 1254.76] I do pray, but after a while, my eyes get heavy, and I just don't have the strength to stay awake.
[1256.46 → 1260.62] He comes back three times and finds us asleep.
[1261.52 → 1262.60] I don't know what to say.
[1262.60 → 1265.88] Jesus is in deep distress.
[1266.42 → 1270.52] In fact, I notice droplets of blood coming out of his pores.
[1272.60 → 1277.00] And here we are, sleeping, like there's nothing to worry about.
[1278.26 → 1280.66] I am so ashamed of my weakness.
[1280.66 → 1310.64] I am so ashamed of my weakness.
[1310.66 → 1340.64] Jesus said,
[1340.66 → 1343.90] Jesus answered,
[1343.90 → 1346.04] I told you that I am he.
[1346.54 → 1349.48] If you are looking for me, then let these men go.
[1350.60 → 1354.30] This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled.
[1355.30 → 1358.38] I have not lost one of those you gave me.
[1359.76 → 1368.28] Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.
[1368.28 → 1370.68] The servant's name was Malchus.
[1371.68 → 1374.90] Jesus commanded Peter, put your sword away.
[1375.90 → 1378.68] Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?
[1378.68 → 1388.46] Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus.
[1388.46 → 1402.00] It's time.
[1402.00 → 1408.58] The priest gives me a contingent of Roman soldiers and slaves to arrest Jesus.
[1408.58 → 1413.30] I greet and kiss him, the signal that this is the one.
[1413.30 → 1420.12] Then Peter, who always reacts to everything, pulls out his sword and I think, this is it.
[1420.12 → 1422.92] Jesus is going to end this quickly.
[1422.92 → 1424.80] It's time to fight.
[1424.80 → 1428.02] It's what we had been waiting for all along.
[1428.50 → 1430.28] For him to conquer the Romans.
[1431.12 → 1432.84] Surely this is his big moment.
[1433.72 → 1435.32] Looks for a minute like it might happen.
[1435.32 → 1437.32] But I'm wrong.
[1437.32 → 1443.00] Peter draws his sword and slices the ear of a servant clean off the side of his face.
[1443.00 → 1448.10] But Jesus scolds Peter, picks up the ear and puts it back on.
[1448.10 → 1452.16] Completely heals this guy who's come to help arrest him.
[1452.16 → 1457.84] Maybe I would have changed sides again if Jesus had fought.
[1457.84 → 1476.48] You mind?
[1476.48 → 1478.48] Amen.
[1506.48 → 1508.48] Amen.
[1536.48 → 1538.48] Amen.
[1566.48 → 1568.48] Amen.
[1568.48 → 1598.46] Amen.
[1598.46 → 1628.44] Amen.
[1628.46 → 1632.80] But Peter had to wait outside at the door.
[1632.80 → 1662.80] 
[1662.80 → 1666.52] Peter, also standing with them, warming himself.
[1666.52 → 1696.52] 
[1696.52 → 1698.68] A rooster began to crow.
[1698.68 → 1713.90] Foolish, foolish wretch that I am.
[1713.90 → 1716.56] He told me.
[1716.56 → 1723.54] I am so arrogant, so sure that I would never let him down.
[1724.54 → 1726.30] Fear has made me a coward.
[1727.14 → 1728.20] I have no excuse.
[1728.20 → 1735.66] Oh, if only I could fall on my knees before him and beg for mercy.
[1737.66 → 1739.86] But he's too far away.
[1741.34 → 1742.48] It's too late.
[1742.48 → 1745.28] I am undone.
[1745.28 → 1769.58] Very early in the morning, the chief priests with the elders, the teachers of the law, and the whole Sanhedrin made their plans.
[1769.58 → 1776.72] So they bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
[1776.72 → 1779.60] Are you the king of the Jews?
[1779.60 → 1780.96] Asked Pilate.
[1781.70 → 1784.60] You have said so, Jesus replied.
[1785.32 → 1788.38] The chief priests accused him of many things.
[1788.38 → 1793.04] So again, Pilate asked him, aren't you going to answer?
[1793.76 → 1796.46] See how many things they are accusing you of.
[1796.46 → 1801.58] But Jesus still made no reply.
[1802.70 → 1804.76] And Pilate was amazed.
[1805.82 → 1811.50] Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
[1812.58 → 1819.14] A man named Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
[1820.00 → 1824.86] The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
[1824.86 → 1828.82] Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?
[1829.32 → 1829.98] Asked Pilate.
[1830.86 → 1836.62] Knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
[1837.66 → 1843.36] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
[1844.64 → 1849.38] What shall I do then with the one you call the king of the Jews?
[1850.00 → 1850.82] Pilate asked them.
[1851.74 → 1852.72] Crucify him!
[1853.40 → 1854.00] They shouted.
[1854.86 → 1855.42] Why?
[1855.64 → 1857.70] What crime has he committed?
[1858.58 → 1859.24] Asked Pilate.
[1859.60 → 1861.68] But they shouted all the louder.
[1862.22 → 1863.26] Crucify him!
[1865.08 → 1870.00] Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them.
[1871.10 → 1876.30] He had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.
[1876.30 → 1895.52] What troublesome people the Jews are.
[1895.52 → 1899.60] Anna's and Caiaphas couldn't make any charges stick.
[1899.60 → 1900.60] So they put this on me.
[1900.60 → 1901.48] So they put this on me.
[1901.48 → 1904.88] Well, I wash my hands of it.
[1905.38 → 1908.50] This man, Jesus, is like no one I have ever met.
[1908.88 → 1909.86] So dignified.
[1910.42 → 1911.26] So calm.
[1911.98 → 1912.78] So articulate.
[1912.78 → 1915.22] When and if he does speak.
[1915.80 → 1919.92] Well, and when he does speak, clearly he's done nothing wrong, and I make my judgment known.
[1919.92 → 1925.34] I keep trying to find a way to release him, but the mob will have nothing to do with it.
[1925.82 → 1930.70] They want that scoundrel Barabbas set free instead of Jesus.
[1931.54 → 1934.06] It is wrong, unjust.
[1934.36 → 1937.32] I know it, but my hands are tied.
[1938.50 → 1940.76] Political decisions can be like that.
[1941.58 → 1944.26] At any rate, I don't want to deal with an uprising.
[1945.12 → 1946.42] These troublesome people.
[1949.92 → 1973.62] Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorian and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
[1973.62 → 1983.96] They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.
[1984.88 → 1987.64] They put a staff in his right hand.
[1988.44 → 1991.30] Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him.
[1992.02 → 1995.26] Hail, King of the Jews, they said.
[1995.26 → 2003.08] They spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
[2003.08 → 2022.20] Sometimes being a soldier is really boring.
[2023.48 → 2024.42] No action.
[2024.42 → 2030.60] Today, though, we see an opportunity for a bit of entertainment.
[2031.96 → 2038.98] We take this Jesus to our headquarters and call everybody out for a bit of fun.
[2040.12 → 2042.84] This guy is unbelievable.
[2044.06 → 2046.64] Just stands there and takes it.
[2046.64 → 2057.76] The mocking, the name-calling, the razor-sharp thorns we push into his skull, the spitting in his face, all of it.
[2059.38 → 2063.58] It isn't as much fun as I thought it would be at all.
[2064.86 → 2067.06] We don't get enough of a reaction.

[2590.48 → 2597.56] criminals were also led out with him to be executed when they came to the place
[2597.56 → 2605.64] called the skull they crucified him there along with the criminals one on
[2605.64 → 2615.20] his right the other on his left Jesus said father forgive them for they do not
[2615.20 → 2623.26] know what they are doing, and they divided up his clothes by casting lots the people
[2623.26 → 2631.40] stood watching and the rulers even sneered at him, they said he saved others let him
[2631.40 → 2640.16] save himself if he is God's Messiah the chosen one the soldiers also came up and
[2640.16 → 2646.64] mocked him they offered him wine vinegar and said if you are the king of the
[2646.64 → 2654.34] Jews save yourself there was a written notice above him which read this is the
[2654.34 → 2662.12] king of the Jews one of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him aren't
[2662.12 → 2669.24] you the Messiah save yourself and us but the other criminal rebuked him don't you
[2669.24 → 2677.56] fear God he said since you are under the same sentence we are punished justly for
[2677.56 → 2685.74] we are getting what our deeds deserve, but this man has done nothing wrong then he
[2685.74 → 2695.58] said Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom Jesus answered him truly I
[2695.58 → 2701.58] tell you today you will be with me in paradise
[2701.58 → 2730.58] I hang beside this Jesus and the soldiers and the rebel yell insults, and they mock him somehow I know he's an innocent man
[2730.58 → 2746.58] man I am so far from who he is I know my guilt which just seems to be magnified as I hang beside him
[2746.58 → 2761.58] even the sinner on the other side mocks him what nerve I defend this Jesus who they identified as the king of the Jews
[2761.58 → 2776.56] then I ask him to remember me when God takes him to heaven and right there he promises me that I am so far from the
[2776.56 → 2781.56] the one where that there is let God give me a place with him in paradise
[2781.56 → 2785.30] Podcast him to give me a place with him in paradise not in some distant future but today
[2785.30 → 2796.92] that's what he says to me at that moment I experienced love as never before
[2796.92 → 2815.80] Jesus, remember me
[2815.80 → 2819.98] When you come into your kingdom
[2819.98 → 2826.44] Jesus, remember me
[2826.44 → 2830.68] When you come into your kingdom
[2830.68 → 2837.10] Jesus, remember me
[2837.10 → 2841.36] When you come into your kingdom
[2841.36 → 2847.86] Jesus, remember me
[2847.86 → 2852.16] When you come into your kingdom
[2856.44 → 2868.70] It was now about noon
[2868.70 → 2873.60] And darkness came over the whole land
[2873.60 → 2876.48] Until three in the afternoon
[2876.48 → 2879.96] For the sun stopped shining
[2879.96 → 2884.34] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two
[2884.34 → 2888.12] Jesus called out with a loud voice
[2888.12 → 2892.62] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit
[2892.62 → 2896.12] When he had said this
[2896.12 → 2899.86] He breathed his last
[2899.86 → 2905.48] The centurion, seeing what had happened
[2905.48 → 2907.72] Praised God and said
[2907.72 → 2910.58] Surely this was a righteous man
[2910.58 → 2914.08] When all the people who had gathered
[2914.08 → 2916.34] To witness this sight
[2916.34 → 2917.88] Saw what took place
[2917.88 → 2920.06] They beat their breasts
[2920.06 → 2921.80] And went away
[2921.80 → 2924.92] But all those who knew him
[2924.92 → 2927.54] Including the women who had followed him
[2927.54 → 2928.34] From Galilee
[2928.34 → 2930.56] Stood at a distance
[2930.56 → 2933.08] Watching these things
[2933.08 → 2949.78] I try to shake off
[2949.78 → 2952.38] The discomfort of what we've done to him
[2952.38 → 2954.54] At our headquarters
[2954.54 → 2958.26] While he hangs on the cross
[2958.26 → 2960.40] We roll some dice
[2960.40 → 2962.30] To pass the time
[2962.30 → 2964.84] And we divide up
[2964.84 → 2966.20] The criminal's garments
[2966.20 → 2970.84] They were going to tear and share his
[2970.84 → 2973.16] But since there was no seam
[2973.16 → 2976.90] I suggest we roll dice for it
[2976.90 → 2979.68] And miracle of miracles
[2979.68 → 2981.34] I win
[2981.34 → 2985.16] Now I'm intrigued
[2985.16 → 2988.56] I start to watch him
[2988.56 → 2991.22] I hear some words
[2991.22 → 2993.74] At first
[2993.74 → 2996.06] I think I'm hearing things
[2996.06 → 2998.82] I hear him say
[2998.82 → 3001.30] Father, forgive them
[3001.30 → 3004.04] For they know not what they do
[3004.04 → 3007.52] Is he talking about us?
[3008.48 → 3009.70] About me?
[3009.70 → 3012.58] Then suddenly
[3012.58 → 3015.34] Right in the middle of the day
[3015.34 → 3017.72] The sun disappears
[3017.72 → 3021.82] And the sky goes pitch black
[3021.82 → 3024.34] This is when
[3024.34 → 3026.08] The king of the Jews
[3026.08 → 3027.74] Gives a shout
[3027.74 → 3030.88] Surrendering his spirit to God
[3030.88 → 3032.80] Or at least
[3032.80 → 3035.54] That's my understanding of it
[3035.54 → 3043.82] Where you live
[3043.82 → 3045.36] Were you there
[3045.36 → 3065.74] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[3065.74 → 3079.74] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[3079.74 → 3106.74] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[3106.74 → 3118.74] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[3118.74 → 3131.74] Were you there when they knelt him on the tree?
[3131.74 → 3143.74] Were you there when they knelt him on the tree?
[3143.74 → 3167.74] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[3167.74 → 3179.74] Were you there when they knelt him on the tree?
[3179.74 → 3201.74] Right then, an earthquake shakes the ground.
[3201.74 → 3208.74] People start to leave.
[3208.74 → 3216.74] I just stand there with his robe in my hands.
[3216.74 → 3226.74] My heart begins to swell, and I fall to my knees before this innocent man.
[3226.74 → 3232.74] Then I do something I've never done before.
[3232.74 → 3235.74] I start to praise God.
[3235.74 → 3244.74] Something mysterious, something wonderful, something awesome has just happened.
[3244.74 → 3251.74] What has just happened?
[3251.74 → 3253.74] Amen.
[3281.74 → 3283.74] Amen.
[3311.74 → 3313.74] Amen.
[3341.74 → 3343.74] Amen.
[3371.74 → 3373.74] Amen.
[3401.74 → 3403.74] Amen.
[3431.74 → 3433.74] Amen.
[3461.74 → 3463.74] Amen.
[3491.74 → 3493.74] Amen.
[3493.74 → 3495.74] Amen.
[3495.74 → 3506.24] As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who had himself
[3506.24 → 3510.22] become a disciple of Jesus.
[3510.22 → 3519.32] Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
[3519.32 → 3527.54] Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb
[3527.54 → 3531.10] that he had cut out of the rock.
[3531.10 → 3538.26] He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
[3538.26 → 3545.32] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
[3545.32 → 3553.54] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary was sitting there with a child.
[3553.54 → 3557.40] Our eyes are red with weeping.
[3557.40 → 3563.38] Our bodies exhausted by the trauma of the scenes of the day.
[3563.38 → 3568.60] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary was sitting there with the body.
[3568.60 → 3575.60] Then, a member of the high Jewish council named Joseph, a good man, garners permission to bury
[3575.60 → 3577.60] Jesus' body.
[3577.60 → 3578.74] Eve Reno Vessel, a healthy man, garners-ображ teddicümtar, spoke to Pathetically 9,2013.
[3578.74 → 3580.24] The Church of Jesus is also still in oxygen and in oxygen.
[3580.24 → 3583.34] From the Church of Jesus moved on representing Jesus, Eric United and the Malaya & см bubble ZG.
[3583.34 → 3587.28] Joseph takes Him to His own new tomb and lays Him inside.
[3587.28 → 3589.16] Enter the bridge with the ark.
[3589.16 → 3594.62] The priests and Pharisees ask Pilate for this extra security…

[3596.84 → 3597.32] 178 aviate, Richard inverted Russian, Bavaria panic, 洗 imaginarily and Galilee under party integrating
[3597.32 → 3599.76] with the обратifics of the Church in specific rooms.
[3599.76 → 3600.90] Between the arrival of a passing of an Also-g ding root Ок, James de Klaus,
[3600.90 → 3610.02] and Pharisees ask pilot for this extra security because they had heard Jesus say that he would
[3610.02 → 3622.98] rise to life in three days they want to be sure no one believes this after all it is possible that
[3622.98 → 3631.46] Jesus's followers would steal the body and start a rumour who would think of that except these
[3631.46 → 3643.62] suspicious and unbelieving religious leaders there is no more time today to anoint his body for burial
[3643.62 → 3669.78] the sun is beginning to set ushering in Shabbat and so now we go home in sorrow, and we wait
