[288.38 --> 289.38]  Good morning, everyone.
[289.38 --> 295.38]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church. Whether you are here in person or joining us on
[295.38 --> 300.10]  live stream, we are glad you're here and we are here to worship the Lord together. My name is
[300.10 --> 306.76]  Jason Truel. I'm the minister here and I'm so glad to be with you this morning. We do have a couple
[306.76 --> 311.72]  of really important announcements. I hope you all got a bulletin and you can find those announcements
[311.72 --> 319.98]  in our bulletin. One important thing is that this Wednesday is our congregational meeting.
[320.58 --> 327.82]  So if you are a member, especially we need you to be here and to vote, but everyone is welcome to
[327.82 --> 339.40]  attend and strongly encouraged to attend. We will be having a lunch, I know coming up because I saw
[339.40 --> 344.70]  the sign-up sheets on the foyer table. So for our soup and bun lunch coming up, please, if you're
[344.70 --> 353.50]  interested to, please sign up to bring soup or buns. And we will be having a hymn sing coming up on March
[353.50 --> 360.34]  10. And there's a special announcement for today, which is an insert in your bulletin. It's for the
[360.34 --> 366.60]  Canadian Food Grains Bank and this is our offering, which we'll be taking later. Marion just reminded me
[366.60 --> 374.98]  that there is a four-to-one matching grant. So you give a dollar, they get four. Or you give a hundred,
[375.06 --> 380.82]  they get four hundred. So it's really powerful way to give. So I want to definitely bring your attention to
[380.82 --> 388.22]  that. And we have a video today. We have a short kind of promotional video that we'll watch. It's only about
[388.22 --> 393.44]  two minutes long and that will explain more about what this ministry is. So we'll watch that now.
[393.44 --> 400.52]  In the south of Madagascar, the population has been affected by a near permanent drought caused
[400.52 --> 407.48]  primarily by deforestation. The dry seasons have hit the island hard and many Malagasy can no longer
[407.48 --> 416.90]  meet ongoing needs like health, food, and education. According to data from January, 2023, 2.23 million
[416.90 --> 423.68]  people or roughly 36% of the population are acutely food insecure, meaning they struggle to eat three
[423.68 --> 429.50]  meals a day or include a variety of nutritious ingredients in their diets. Over 300,000 children
[429.50 --> 435.26]  under five are experiencing acute malnutrition. To show the mercy of Christ in the face of this
[435.26 --> 439.58]  situation, food assistance was offered to the households most vulnerable to hunger by World
[439.58 --> 445.94]  Renew and Canadian Food Grains Bank working with SAF FJKM. Food baskets can help sustain families
[445.94 --> 451.62]  through these times of crisis. But also in the region, we offered training to provide an
[451.62 --> 456.74]  opportunity for people to diversify their skills and sustain themselves in the drought season.
[456.74 --> 461.94]  Participants have learned weaving, metallurgy, sustainable farming techniques, and more.
[461.94 --> 465.26]  In order to assemble a healthy nogle more children with infiniteazo neurobi féminin is открыty.
[465.26 --> 468.10]  For example, governors here alwaysmartian students eat this, human are in the institute course.
[468.10 --> 471.16]  Maybe they'll buy traditional transport difficulties or lower children with their own
[471.16 --> 472.62]  concerns. If people start advising, conceptualising people use their own things as natural
[472.62 --> 473.92]  devices, they request medical sciences,ということs, useful problems so they use the
[473.92 --> 477.08]  washing telling themselves through how they work with手 plan. But with labor, those who actually
[477.08 --> 481.46]  את WORLD sağ end, they get limited to fuse rules. And they get limited to write Uniqtu. I bring in what
[481.46 --> 485.90] oku pages to slime! I bring to the lasaki document, Whether it happens to you, but whether it comes down from us. Of course all the time the
[485.90 --> 486.28]  nine captions have worked with the喔 and Eva supplies has operated with them, there's every 24areking process, Jue times, the cues for injuries
[486.28 --> 510.64]  When you support Canadian Food Grades bank projects to World Renew, you are helping us
[510.64 --> 515.96]  to identify situations of hunger before despair takes a hold and bring God's love in action.
[515.96 --> 521.62]  Emergency assistance and early intervention can make ending hunger possible in Madagascar
[521.62 --> 522.96]  and around the world.
[522.96 --> 528.62]  I think those videos are very informative.
[528.62 --> 534.28]  It would be nice if we had a video for every designated cause.
[534.28 --> 539.94]  But that was great.
[539.94 --> 558.60]  One final announcement is that we are actually now receiving nominations for the positions,
[558.60 --> 560.94]  offices of elder and deacon in our church.
[560.94 --> 568.76]  And so if you have a suggestion of someone who could be gifted to serve in that role
[568.76 --> 573.66]  of elder or deacon in our church, please do forward those names to our council clerk, John
[573.66 --> 574.04]  Banstra.
[575.12 --> 577.44]  And the deadline for that submission is March 4.
[577.44 --> 587.50]  So we are here to worship the true and everlasting God, the God who is forever faithful to us.
[588.24 --> 596.38]  And so let's hear his call to us, his call for us, his summons to come before him and worship
[596.38 --> 596.68]  him.
[596.72 --> 601.30]  And our call to worship this morning is from Isaiah chapter 40 verses 28 to 31.
[601.44 --> 603.40]  And let's read it this morning responsibly.
[604.18 --> 604.84]  And I'll begin.
[604.84 --> 606.84]  Do you not know?
[607.36 --> 608.54]  Have you not heard?
[609.10 --> 615.16]  The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth.
[615.82 --> 622.76]  He will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom.
[623.94 --> 629.82]  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
[629.82 --> 635.76]  Even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall.
[636.36 --> 639.92]  But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
[641.28 --> 644.50]  They will soar on wings like eagles.
[645.12 --> 647.46]  They will run and not grow weary.
[648.12 --> 650.96]  They will walk and not be faint.
[651.56 --> 653.72]  Let's come before the Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[653.86 --> 654.64]  Please pray with me.
[654.64 --> 663.26]  Our heavenly Father, as we gather this morning, our minds are often much too filled with thoughts
[663.26 --> 668.62]  of ourselves, of our circumstances, even of our friends and loved ones.
[669.72 --> 674.72]  And so Lord, would you help us now in this hour to entrust all of those things to you.
[674.72 --> 683.98]  Fill our minds with thoughts of you and of your spirit and your son, of your grace and your love,
[684.30 --> 686.52]  of your judgment and your mercy.
[687.72 --> 694.94]  And Father, we gather at your call to see you in all of your glory and to worship you as the everlasting God
[694.94 --> 696.76]  in truth and goodness and beauty.
[696.76 --> 706.26]  And as we sing and pray this morning, as we confess and adore you, hear your words read and preached.
[707.12 --> 714.30]  Please, Lord, renew us in your strength so that we might then go out refreshed and enabled
[714.30 --> 720.86]  in everything we say and do and think and feel to share the good news of your love for this world that you have made
[720.86 --> 725.56]  in the giving of your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died and rose again.
[725.56 --> 732.14]  We worship you, our Father, in the name of Jesus and relying on the power of the Holy Spirit.
[733.14 --> 736.58]  We ask that you would receive all glory this morning.
[737.12 --> 738.98]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[739.96 --> 746.30]  Let's arise and stand for God's greeting to us this morning from Deuteronomy chapter 33.
[746.48 --> 747.16]  It says this.
[748.78 --> 750.48]  It does not, but listen.
[751.30 --> 752.58]  It does say it, but you'll listen.
[752.58 --> 761.62]  The eternal God is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms.
[762.50 --> 766.70]  So as God has called us and he's greeted us, let's turn and greet those around you.
[766.70 --> 766.82]  Amen.
[766.82 --> 766.90]  Amen.
[766.90 --> 767.02]  Amen.
[767.02 --> 767.10]  Amen.
[767.10 --> 767.14]  Amen.
[767.14 --> 767.34]  Amen.
[767.34 --> 767.70]  Amen.
[767.70 --> 768.14]  Amen.
[768.14 --> 768.82]  Amen.
[768.82 --> 769.14]  Amen.
[782.58 --> 810.36]  Amen.
[810.36 --> 810.46]  Amen.
[810.46 --> 811.70]  Good morning to you all.
[812.18 --> 816.46]  We'll open our corporate worship with O Worship the King.
[825.34 --> 832.70]  O Worship the King, O Glorious O Lord,
[832.70 --> 839.70]  who needfully saved His power and His love.
[839.70 --> 846.88]  The shield and defender, the ancient of days,
[847.18 --> 854.80]  the hill in splendor and girded with grace.
[855.52 --> 861.70]  O tell of His blood and sing of His way,
[861.70 --> 868.70]  and hope is the light whose good of His praise.
[868.70 --> 875.70]  His chance of wrath, when He fled and left poor,
[875.70 --> 881.40]  when dark is His path on the way,
[881.40 --> 883.70]  O must die.
[883.70 --> 888.50]  Your power in the way,
[888.50 --> 891.90]  what talk can be signed?
[891.90 --> 895.40]  In peace in the air,
[895.40 --> 898.90]  which I have the light,
[898.90 --> 901.70]  which streams on the hills,
[901.70 --> 906.70]  being Kilted, He sends to the plain,
[906.70 --> 913.12]  when謝謝 His conjugate number and the rete.
[913.12 --> 921.80]  Frail children of lost and people of strength
[921.80 --> 928.90]  In you we trust, your body will fail
[928.90 --> 936.06]  Your mercy is outended, outfarm to the end
[936.06 --> 944.06]  A leader, defender, defender, and friend
[944.06 --> 952.06]  Measureless life, the change of the law
[952.78 --> 960.06]  In the need of the law, the burden of God
[960.06 --> 968.06]  For the rest of the nation, the glory of God
[968.06 --> 971.06]  In you we trust, your glory of God
[971.06 --> 976.06]  In you we trust, your Savior, your name
[976.06 --> 978.06]  Amen
[978.06 --> 987.56]  This song says there's ten thousand reasons
[987.56 --> 990.44]  And I bet there's even more than that
[990.44 --> 992.08]  To give God our praise today
[992.08 --> 993.48]  For all that he's done
[993.48 --> 997.26]  And all that he's supplied for us
[997.26 --> 999.58]  And brought us to know him
[999.58 --> 1001.92]  And revealed himself, so many reasons
[1001.92 --> 1004.56]  Let's give him all we are today
[1004.56 --> 1019.02]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1019.02 --> 1021.56]  O my soul
[1021.56 --> 1026.68]  Worship his holy name
[1026.68 --> 1029.56]  Sing like never before
[1029.56 --> 1030.56]  O my soul
[1030.56 --> 1032.56]  O my soul
[1032.56 --> 1036.56]  I'll worship your holy name
[1036.56 --> 1042.56]  The sound of time
[1042.56 --> 1046.56]  It's a new day dawning
[1046.56 --> 1050.56]  It's time to sing your song again
[1050.56 --> 1053.56]  Whatever may pass
[1053.56 --> 1055.56]  Whatever may pass
[1055.56 --> 1057.56]  And whatever does before me
[1057.56 --> 1061.56]  Let me be singing with thee
[1061.56 --> 1063.56]  Be high
[1063.56 --> 1069.56]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1069.56 --> 1070.56]  O my soul
[1070.56 --> 1077.56]  Worship his holy name
[1077.56 --> 1080.56]  Till my family before
[1080.56 --> 1083.56]  O my soul
[1083.56 --> 1087.56]  I'll worship your holy name
[1087.56 --> 1094.56]  You're rich in love
[1094.56 --> 1097.56]  And you're slow to wake
[1097.56 --> 1099.56]  Your name is great
[1099.56 --> 1102.56]  And your heart is kind
[1102.56 --> 1104.56]  For all your goodness
[1104.56 --> 1108.56]  I will keep on singing
[1108.56 --> 1111.56]  Ten thousand reasons
[1111.56 --> 1112.56]  Ten thousand reasons
[1112.56 --> 1116.56]  In my heart to find
[1116.56 --> 1121.56]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1121.56 --> 1122.56]  O my soul
[1122.56 --> 1123.56]  O my soul
[1123.56 --> 1124.56]  Worship his holy name
[1124.56 --> 1128.56]  Sing like never before
[1128.56 --> 1134.56]  O my soul
[1134.56 --> 1138.56]  I'll worship your holy name
[1138.56 --> 1145.56]  On that day
[1145.56 --> 1148.56]  When my strength is ready
[1148.56 --> 1150.56]  The end is here
[1150.56 --> 1153.56]  And my time has come
[1153.56 --> 1156.56]  Still my soul
[1156.56 --> 1159.56]  Will sing a praise unending
[1159.56 --> 1163.56]  And thousand women
[1163.56 --> 1167.56]  Forever more
[1167.56 --> 1172.56]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1172.56 --> 1173.56]  O my soul
[1173.56 --> 1174.56]  O my soul
[1174.56 --> 1179.56]  Worship his holy name
[1179.56 --> 1182.56]  Sing like never before
[1182.56 --> 1185.56]  O my soul
[1185.56 --> 1189.56]  I'll worship your holy name
[1189.56 --> 1194.56]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1194.56 --> 1196.56]  Worship your holy name
[1196.56 --> 1197.56]  I'll worship your holy name
[1197.56 --> 1201.56]  Worship your holy name
[1201.56 --> 1211.74]  Sing like never before, oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1213.08 --> 1217.04]  I'll worship your holy name.
[1218.40 --> 1223.20]  I'll worship your holy name.
[1225.52 --> 1228.04]  You can be seated for our next song.
[1231.56 --> 1233.56]  Amen.
[1248.52 --> 1257.74]  Holding words, how preserve, for our walk is true.
[1257.74 --> 1266.74]  May resound with God's love, O let the ancient earth depart.
[1268.74 --> 1276.74]  Words of life, words of hope, give us strength and control.
[1276.74 --> 1285.74]  In this world where ever grown, ancient words will guide us home.
[1285.74 --> 1294.74]  Ancient words ever do, changing me and changing you.
[1294.74 --> 1303.74]  We have come with overworked, O let the ancient earth depart.
[1303.74 --> 1305.74]  Amen.
[1305.74 --> 1335.74] 
[1335.74 --> 1350.74]  Ancient words ever do, changing me and changing you.
[1350.74 --> 1359.74]  We have come with overworked, O let the ancient earth depart.
[1359.74 --> 1367.74]  Ancient words ever do, changing me and changing you.
[1367.74 --> 1376.74]  We have come with overworked, O let the ancient earth depart.
[1376.74 --> 1386.74]  We have come with overworked, O let the ancient earth depart.
[1386.74 --> 1397.74]  Except what's in theě so therefore …
[1397.74 --> 1401.74]  And so let's come with open hearts before God's Word now in our first scripture reading
[1401.74 --> 1408.36]  In our first scripture reading for today, I want to encourage you to pull out your Pew Bible, the brown one in front of you.
[1409.20 --> 1413.06]  I did decide to put it on the screen this week as well.
[1413.06 --> 1421.40]  So it will be there, but you can join me if you'd like in turning to Mark 13.
[1423.34 --> 1426.62]  And we will read verses 32 to 37.
[1426.76 --> 1431.24]  It's on page 756 in your Pew Bible.
[1431.74 --> 1439.68]  This is the reading of God's word.
[1440.36 --> 1448.70]  No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
[1449.72 --> 1451.60]  Be on guard, be alert.
[1452.42 --> 1454.86]  You do not know when that time will come.
[1455.72 --> 1457.24]  It's like a man going away.
[1457.24 --> 1465.42]  He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.
[1465.42 --> 1476.12]  Therefore, keep watch, because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back, whether in the evening or at midnight, or when the rooster crows or at dawn.
[1476.72 --> 1479.48]  If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
[1480.14 --> 1483.48]  What I say to you, I say to everyone, watch.
[1483.48 --> 1486.54]  This is the reading of God's word.
[1488.82 --> 1491.10]  Come now to our time of confession.
[1491.10 --> 1497.82]  When we worship him, we get a glimpse of his holiness.
[1498.72 --> 1505.04]  It leads us to then consider the ways that we fall short of that holy, perfect standard.
[1506.24 --> 1509.84]  And we can be tempted to make one of two errors.
[1509.84 --> 1518.36]  We could first maybe run away in shame, unwilling to come to God, right?
[1518.38 --> 1521.66]  Feeling kind of overwhelmed by the burden of our guilt.
[1522.22 --> 1523.96]  And so we want to hide from God.
[1525.66 --> 1531.08]  Or, on the other hand, we can think that sin is not a big deal, right?
[1531.10 --> 1532.84]  That God will overlook it.
[1532.94 --> 1533.92]  He's forgiving, right?
[1533.92 --> 1536.56]  And I'm not as bad as other people.
[1536.56 --> 1542.94]  So whether we kind of, in the face of God's holiness, run away from him in shame,
[1543.14 --> 1548.16]  or not come to him because we don't think sin is the big deal,
[1548.26 --> 1551.52]  either way, those responses lead us away from God.
[1552.58 --> 1556.54]  While he would have us come to him in our sin,
[1556.90 --> 1560.24]  so that we might experience his forgiveness and his healing.
[1561.08 --> 1566.14]  So let's come before God in prayer, in his prayer of confession,
[1566.56 --> 1569.50]  please join me as I lead us in prayer.
[1569.64 --> 1570.04]  Please pray.
[1572.74 --> 1576.42]  Merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you
[1576.42 --> 1581.38]  in thought, word, and deed.
[1582.60 --> 1584.58]  By the things that we have done,
[1585.24 --> 1587.70]  and by what we have left undone.
[1588.74 --> 1591.38]  We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1592.04 --> 1595.04]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1595.04 --> 1598.98]  We are truly sorry, and we humbly repent.
[1599.98 --> 1603.46]  For the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us,
[1603.84 --> 1605.46]  and forgive us.
[1606.04 --> 1610.20]  That we might delight in your will and walk in your ways,
[1610.62 --> 1612.28]  to the glory of your name.
[1613.32 --> 1613.76]  Amen.
[1613.76 --> 1622.70]  Then, brothers and sisters, this is how the Lord assures us of his great love and his forgiveness,
[1623.18 --> 1625.12]  with these words from Psalm 103.
[1625.12 --> 1631.14]  He does not treat us as our sins deserve,
[1631.14 --> 1634.50]  or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1634.96 --> 1637.58]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[1637.92 --> 1640.62]  so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1640.80 --> 1644.38]  As far as the east is from the west,
[1645.06 --> 1649.34]  so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1649.34 --> 1650.96]  Thanks be to God.
[1651.70 --> 1656.10]  Let's stand and we'll sing our song of renewal together.
[1656.54 --> 1657.40]  Let's stand and sing.
[1657.40 --> 1687.38]  Let's stand and sing.
[1687.40 --> 1717.38]  Let's stand and sing.
[1717.40 --> 1747.38]  Let's stand and sing.
[1747.40 --> 1777.38]  Let's stand and sing.
[1777.40 --> 1784.40]  All to Jesus I surrender.
[1784.40 --> 1791.40]  Make me Savior, Holy God.
[1791.40 --> 1797.40]  Let me fill the Holy Spirit.
[1797.40 --> 1799.40]  I surrender.
[1799.40 --> 1801.40]  I surrender.
[1801.40 --> 1803.40]  I surrender.
[1803.40 --> 1805.92]  I surrender.
[1809.40 --> 1810.40]  I surrender all.
[1810.40 --> 1816.40]  I surrender all.
[1816.40 --> 1818.40]  All to thee, God, blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1818.40 --> 1829.74]  All to Thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1831.36 --> 1844.74]  All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee.
[1844.74 --> 1858.74]  Fill me with my love and power, and my blessings fall on Thee.
[1859.94 --> 1864.90]  I surrender all.
[1864.90 --> 1871.74]  I surrender all.
[1871.74 --> 1884.98]  All to Thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1886.98 --> 1888.14]  Thank you.
[1888.14 --> 1897.40]  Great singing, everyone.
[1898.48 --> 1908.36]  So it is now time for the children to go to their classes where they can learn about the Lord in an age-tailored way.
[1908.36 --> 1908.42]  Let's see.
[1918.74 --> 1920.20]  So good morning again.
[1920.64 --> 1930.44]  Now, we have come through the seasons of Advent and Christmas and Epiphany, and we now come to the season in the church calendar called Lent.
[1930.44 --> 1940.24]  And I know that might not be familiar to everyone here, but it is a time when the church surrenders 40 days of the year, not including Sundays,
[1941.04 --> 1946.96]  to journeying with Jesus in the wilderness of his suffering and death.
[1946.96 --> 1960.70]  And now to help us to grow in grace as a church family and to kind of lean into the season, we are beginning a new sermon series today that we're calling Remember Your Death.
[1960.70 --> 1973.54]  And the invitation of this series is to do something that maybe you have never done before, which is to contemplate your own death.
[1973.54 --> 1978.80]  Now, why on earth are we doing this?
[1979.72 --> 1983.10]  Why a sermon series on death?
[1984.38 --> 1985.22]  Two reasons.
[1985.76 --> 1986.54]  There's many reasons.
[1986.64 --> 1987.62]  Two I want to name now.
[1987.94 --> 1993.22]  The first, this is a topic that is relevant to all of us.
[1993.98 --> 1996.10]  Of any topic, you can say this is relevant.
[1996.46 --> 1998.56]  This is relevant to every single one of us.
[1998.64 --> 1999.48]  There is no exception.
[2000.52 --> 2001.46]  Think about this.
[2001.46 --> 2006.92]  St. Augustine wrote almost 1700 years ago in his work, The City of God.
[2006.92 --> 2007.82]  He said,
[2008.64 --> 2017.56]  As doctors, when they examine the state of a patient and recognize that death is at hand, they pronounce,
[2018.50 --> 2019.50]  He is dying.
[2019.70 --> 2020.84]  He will not recover.
[2021.82 --> 2029.70]  So we must say, from the moment a person is born in this world, he will not recover.
[2031.46 --> 2036.82]  The reality is that every single human being has a terminal illness.
[2037.52 --> 2039.84]  And none of us will recover from it.
[2040.92 --> 2043.62]  And so that's the first reason why a sermon series on death.
[2043.86 --> 2051.40]  The second reason is the job of a pastor is to prepare people for their death.
[2051.40 --> 2053.62]  You may not have known that.
[2054.14 --> 2055.58]  I have not always known that.
[2056.36 --> 2061.40]  But if you want to kind of take a pastor's job description and distill it down into one sentence,
[2061.62 --> 2062.72]  you could say this,
[2063.40 --> 2065.04]  Preparing people for their death.
[2066.16 --> 2068.62]  So that's why we're going to spend just a few weeks
[2068.62 --> 2071.62]  doing this very uncomfortable thing
[2071.62 --> 2074.38]  of contemplating our own deaths.
[2074.38 --> 2076.84]  It's because every single one of us will die
[2076.84 --> 2078.76]  and because it's my job
[2078.76 --> 2080.40]  to prepare you for it.
[2081.54 --> 2082.92]  And so as we do this, though,
[2083.24 --> 2084.32]  we're not going to,
[2084.42 --> 2087.44]  it's not because of some sort of morbid fascination.
[2087.72 --> 2089.54]  It's not just about doom and gloom.
[2090.36 --> 2092.86]  But by remembering that we are dust
[2092.86 --> 2095.32]  and that our lives are short and soon past,
[2095.32 --> 2097.66]  we gain a heart of wisdom.
[2098.72 --> 2101.04]  And we learn how to live this life
[2101.04 --> 2102.26]  that God has given us
[2102.26 --> 2105.48]  with courage and joy and hope
[2105.48 --> 2107.86]  and a deeper love for Jesus.
[2108.62 --> 2110.44]  That's what we're about in this series.
[2110.92 --> 2113.06]  So let's turn to our passage for today.
[2113.56 --> 2115.22]  And we're going to be in Psalm 90.
[2115.34 --> 2115.94]  Psalm 90.
[2117.20 --> 2121.74]  And that is on page 444 in your pew Bible.
[2123.74 --> 2124.82]  Psalm 90.
[2125.32 --> 2137.92]  Let's give our attention
[2137.92 --> 2138.94]  to the reading of God's word.
[2140.22 --> 2142.42]  Lord, you have been our dwelling place
[2142.42 --> 2143.70]  throughout all generations.
[2145.66 --> 2147.70]  Before the mountains were born
[2147.70 --> 2150.40]  or you brought forth the earth and the world,
[2150.92 --> 2153.18]  from everlasting to everlasting,
[2153.42 --> 2154.08]  you are God.
[2154.08 --> 2156.98]  You turn men back to dust,
[2157.68 --> 2158.08]  saying,
[2158.20 --> 2160.22]  Return to dust, O sons of men.
[2161.20 --> 2163.30]  For a thousand years in your sight
[2163.30 --> 2165.26]  is like a day that has just gone by
[2165.26 --> 2166.86]  or like a watch in the night.
[2167.72 --> 2170.12]  You sweep men away in the sleep of death.
[2170.86 --> 2172.52]  They are like the new grass of the morning.
[2173.44 --> 2175.24]  Though in the morning it springs up new,
[2175.76 --> 2177.44]  by evening it is dry and withered.
[2177.44 --> 2180.14]  We are consumed by your anger
[2180.14 --> 2182.96]  and terrified by your indignation.
[2183.50 --> 2186.22]  You have set your iniquities before you,
[2186.82 --> 2188.68]  our iniquities before you,
[2188.82 --> 2191.46]  our secret sins in the light of your presence.
[2191.46 --> 2195.52]  All our days pass away under your wrath.
[2195.94 --> 2198.48]  We finish our years with a moan.
[2199.18 --> 2201.82]  The length of our days is 70 years or 80,
[2201.96 --> 2202.92]  if we have the strength.
[2203.56 --> 2205.84]  Yet their span is but trouble and sorrow,
[2206.44 --> 2209.28]  and they quickly pass and we fly away.
[2209.28 --> 2213.04]  Who knows the power of your anger,
[2213.48 --> 2216.72]  for your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.
[2217.88 --> 2220.58]  Teach us to number our days aright,
[2220.86 --> 2222.94]  that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[2224.14 --> 2227.08]  Relent, O Lord, how long will it be?
[2227.88 --> 2229.64]  Have compassion on your servants.
[2230.28 --> 2233.18]  Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love,
[2233.18 --> 2237.40]  that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
[2238.46 --> 2241.78]  Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
[2242.20 --> 2244.54]  for as many years as we have seen trouble.
[2245.44 --> 2247.70]  May your deeds be shown to your servants,
[2248.22 --> 2249.66]  your splendor to their children.
[2250.42 --> 2254.02]  May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us.
[2254.70 --> 2256.78]  Establish the work of our hands for us.
[2257.58 --> 2261.16]  Yes, establish the work of our hands.
[2261.16 --> 2263.20]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2265.48 --> 2266.20]  Let's pray.
[2267.92 --> 2271.14]  Heavenly Father, would you give us the grace that we need
[2271.14 --> 2274.24]  to face the things that we don't want to face?
[2275.18 --> 2277.68]  And would you give us courage to talk about things
[2277.68 --> 2278.98]  that we would rather avoid,
[2279.50 --> 2283.56]  so that we might become your resiliently joyful people.
[2284.18 --> 2287.12]  In the name of Jesus, our Savior, we pray.
[2287.82 --> 2288.26]  Amen.
[2289.48 --> 2291.12]  So I want to begin with this story.
[2291.46 --> 2293.28]  You know, sometimes, you might not know this,
[2293.38 --> 2296.84]  but pastors, you know, there's stories that pastors will use.
[2297.02 --> 2298.10]  It's kind of like a pastor story.
[2298.76 --> 2300.24]  So I'm going to tell you one of those.
[2300.32 --> 2302.06]  It's not my story, but it is a true story.
[2303.28 --> 2305.52]  There's a man who became very ill,
[2306.12 --> 2308.76]  and he went to the hospital in the middle of the night.
[2308.76 --> 2310.84]  And after running some tests, the doctors,
[2311.06 --> 2314.32]  they came into his room and delivered the bad news
[2314.32 --> 2316.50]  that he did not have much longer to live.
[2317.20 --> 2320.16]  In a panic, he called his pastor.
[2320.88 --> 2322.50]  It's a good thing to do in the middle of the night.
[2323.50 --> 2325.12]  The pastor answered the phone.
[2325.64 --> 2328.76]  I usually have my phone on silent at night, just so you know.
[2328.76 --> 2333.38]  But the pastor answered the phone, and he said he'd be right over.
[2334.14 --> 2335.02]  He got dressed.
[2335.54 --> 2337.70]  He drove to the hospital and went into the man's room.
[2338.78 --> 2340.86]  And as he walked in, the sick man said,
[2340.86 --> 2344.20]  Oh, pastor, I'm so sorry to have bothered you.
[2344.94 --> 2347.58]  The doctors gave me this awful prognosis,
[2347.80 --> 2349.88]  and said I didn't have long to live.
[2350.10 --> 2353.08]  And I panicked, and I realized I was dying.
[2353.70 --> 2356.20]  So I realized I had a lot to talk to you about.
[2357.36 --> 2360.58]  But right before you came in, the doctors came back
[2360.58 --> 2363.88]  and told me that they had mixed up the test results with somebody else.
[2364.64 --> 2366.52]  It turns out I'm going to be just fine,
[2366.52 --> 2368.74]  so I don't need to talk to you anymore.
[2371.06 --> 2373.48]  And now the pastor was gracious, and he said,
[2373.66 --> 2374.18]  I understand.
[2374.52 --> 2376.04]  I'm so glad to hear the good news.
[2376.52 --> 2377.30]  And he went back home.
[2378.24 --> 2380.66]  But of course, the irony of the story
[2380.66 --> 2384.42]  is that this man's mortality hasn't changed.
[2384.42 --> 2387.64]  But rather, the urgency he felt,
[2388.38 --> 2390.98]  the need to be ready for death,
[2391.48 --> 2394.80]  the need to live differently with the time that remained,
[2395.88 --> 2399.66]  faded away as soon as he got the different news from the doctor.
[2401.24 --> 2404.88]  But the Bible tells us that there is something wise
[2404.88 --> 2408.32]  about living with readiness,
[2409.28 --> 2412.50]  with living with an awareness that life is short,
[2412.50 --> 2415.76]  that death may come suddenly and unexpectedly.
[2417.20 --> 2421.82]  And therefore, a wise person lives every day
[2421.82 --> 2425.84]  knowing that tomorrow is not guaranteed.
[2426.92 --> 2429.06]  And that is the message of Psalm 90.
[2430.06 --> 2432.52]  And the core message of this psalm
[2432.52 --> 2435.82]  is right in the middle of the passage in verse 12.
[2435.92 --> 2437.06]  So let's have a look at it.
[2437.40 --> 2438.08]  Verse 12.
[2438.08 --> 2441.88]  Teach us to number our days
[2441.88 --> 2446.54]  that we may gain from mortality in asking for grace.
[2447.08 --> 2449.18]  Let's start with the first one, the first part,
[2449.64 --> 2450.68]  longing for eternity.
[2451.40 --> 2454.12]  Now, I'm not sure if I didn't read that part in the beginning,
[2454.26 --> 2456.18]  but the author of Psalm 90 is who?
[2457.44 --> 2457.96]  Moses.
[2458.60 --> 2459.46]  So that's interesting.
[2459.46 --> 2464.58]  So he begins the psalm like this in verses 1 and 2.
[2465.64 --> 2469.58]  Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
[2470.06 --> 2473.50]  Before the mountains were born, or you brought forth the whole world,
[2473.72 --> 2477.30]  from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[2478.26 --> 2481.28]  Now, this is one of the most kind of clear places in Scripture
[2481.28 --> 2484.20]  that talks about the eternality of God,
[2484.28 --> 2485.82]  that God is the everlasting God.
[2485.82 --> 2488.14]  But what I want to focus on,
[2488.18 --> 2489.92]  one thing I believe that Moses is saying,
[2490.62 --> 2495.42]  is that we were made to dwell with God.
[2495.86 --> 2499.48]  He says, Lord, you have been our dwelling place
[2499.48 --> 2501.16]  throughout all generations.
[2502.32 --> 2506.60]  So the everlasting God who existed from all eternity,
[2507.22 --> 2509.94]  he created the whole world and everything in it,
[2510.32 --> 2512.28]  and he made human beings,
[2512.70 --> 2515.74]  and he made us in his image.
[2516.78 --> 2520.42]  In other words, we were created in the image of the eternal God.
[2521.48 --> 2523.84]  And part of what that means, it means a lot of things,
[2523.92 --> 2525.02]  but part of what that means,
[2525.52 --> 2528.76]  is we were created for eternity.
[2530.04 --> 2536.04]  God made us to live with him forever in the world that he created.
[2537.26 --> 2540.88]  And we see this idea that we were made for eternity
[2540.88 --> 2542.22]  in another place in Scripture,
[2542.76 --> 2545.20]  in Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11.
[2545.82 --> 2547.40]  Where the author writes this,
[2548.06 --> 2552.42]  God has set eternity in the human heart.
[2554.42 --> 2558.44]  And so to bear God's image as human beings
[2558.44 --> 2562.08]  is to long for eternity.
[2562.78 --> 2566.26]  The sense of eternity is something that is deeply part of who we are.
[2566.26 --> 2568.88]  And if that sounds a little abstract,
[2569.58 --> 2570.58]  think about it this way.
[2572.34 --> 2576.18]  Have you ever looked through an old photo album?
[2576.18 --> 2580.00]  And you're just kind of flipping through these old photos
[2580.00 --> 2582.82]  and seeing pictures from many, many years ago.
[2583.78 --> 2587.76]  And then have you ever felt yourself strangely moved?
[2588.34 --> 2588.82]  Right?
[2588.84 --> 2590.26]  By looking at these old photos.
[2590.42 --> 2592.04]  Maybe even tearing up.
[2592.74 --> 2594.46]  Maybe even sobbing.
[2594.46 --> 2596.56]  Without really knowing why.
[2598.96 --> 2601.16]  Do you know what that is?
[2602.06 --> 2606.26]  This feeling of nostalgia that kind of wells up within you,
[2606.34 --> 2608.46]  that is a longing for eternity.
[2609.42 --> 2609.60]  Right?
[2609.66 --> 2612.18]  That eternity is written on every human heart.
[2612.18 --> 2614.54]  Because you see a time from the past
[2614.54 --> 2616.78]  and you can't get back to it.
[2617.26 --> 2618.34]  And you miss it.
[2619.32 --> 2621.80]  And you wish that moment, that time,
[2622.16 --> 2624.06]  would last forever.
[2625.34 --> 2625.94]  Why?
[2627.42 --> 2627.78]  Right?
[2627.78 --> 2630.02]  What other creature does that?
[2630.40 --> 2634.06]  What other animal in the natural world longs for the past?
[2634.54 --> 2634.66]  Right?
[2634.76 --> 2635.28]  None.
[2635.50 --> 2635.94]  None of them.
[2636.32 --> 2638.18]  This is a uniquely human thing.
[2639.40 --> 2642.82]  And what it is, is eternity written on the human heart.
[2643.98 --> 2646.10]  Wait, we grieve the passing of time.
[2646.38 --> 2648.50]  We never have enough of it.
[2649.90 --> 2654.00]  And this longing that we all have is not just an abstract longing,
[2654.00 --> 2656.02]  but it's actually a longing for God.
[2657.78 --> 2658.46]  Right?
[2658.52 --> 2661.36]  We don't just desire for life just to go on and on,
[2661.82 --> 2665.24]  but actually we desire to be with God.
[2665.76 --> 2667.66]  To be at home with God.
[2667.72 --> 2669.18]  He is our dwelling place.
[2670.42 --> 2673.38]  And so in a sense, every human being, we're like an orphan.
[2674.66 --> 2677.54]  And we have this ache in our souls for a home
[2677.54 --> 2680.64]  and for a parent that we have never known.
[2683.04 --> 2684.72]  Eternity is written on our hearts
[2684.72 --> 2687.32]  because you and I were made in the image of God.
[2687.78 --> 2689.02]  The eternal God.
[2689.68 --> 2692.52]  And we were made to dwell with God forever.
[2693.86 --> 2696.72]  And that's what Moses says here in the first few verses.
[2696.80 --> 2698.66]  We have this longing for eternity.
[2699.58 --> 2703.12]  But then the author moves to the next part,
[2703.24 --> 2706.04]  admitting our mortality.
[2706.48 --> 2709.46]  And we see this, this admitting our mortality,
[2710.00 --> 2712.34]  in this psalm, Psalm 90, in a few ways.
[2712.34 --> 2714.82]  So look, verse 3, it says,
[2715.24 --> 2717.82]  You turn people back to dust, saying,
[2718.44 --> 2720.86]  Return to dust, you mortals.
[2722.16 --> 2725.02]  Now this is a reference back to what?
[2726.16 --> 2727.10]  Genesis, right?
[2727.10 --> 2731.80]  This is where the story of how death came into the world.
[2732.34 --> 2733.32]  This is where we find it.
[2733.40 --> 2735.46]  God made the first humans, Adam and Eve,
[2735.94 --> 2736.92]  in his image.
[2737.62 --> 2739.30]  He put them in his garden.
[2739.84 --> 2743.06]  And they had this wonderful relationship with God.
[2743.44 --> 2746.62]  And it's described in this very kind of vivid way
[2746.62 --> 2750.40]  as walking with God in the cool of the morning.
[2750.40 --> 2752.58]  Isn't that beautiful?
[2753.70 --> 2754.84]  That's what we were made for,
[2754.92 --> 2756.72]  walking with God in the cool of the morning.
[2757.54 --> 2759.62]  But we don't know what that's like
[2759.62 --> 2763.58]  because our life with God was lost to us.
[2764.94 --> 2766.40]  In Genesis chapter 2,
[2766.52 --> 2768.18]  God gave Adam and Eve a command.
[2768.40 --> 2768.78]  He said,
[2769.12 --> 2771.50]  You are free to eat of any tree in the garden,
[2772.16 --> 2775.04]  but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2775.58 --> 2778.22]  For when you eat from it, you will certainly die.
[2778.22 --> 2780.62]  And that's just what happened.
[2781.64 --> 2781.74]  Right?
[2781.84 --> 2783.94]  So rather than listening to God,
[2784.34 --> 2788.24]  trusting God to define what is good and evil for us,
[2788.56 --> 2793.76]  they chose to decide what is right and wrong for themselves.
[2794.10 --> 2795.12]  That's what happened.
[2795.72 --> 2798.38]  And they ate the fruit that God told them not to eat.
[2799.14 --> 2801.70]  And as a result of the fall into sin,
[2801.90 --> 2804.06]  we receive the wages of sin,
[2804.28 --> 2805.12]  which is death,
[2806.04 --> 2806.94]  which is mortality.
[2808.22 --> 2810.10]  And so the moment you are born,
[2810.90 --> 2811.86]  you begin to die.
[2812.32 --> 2814.82]  And God tells the first humans of their mortality
[2814.82 --> 2816.36]  in Genesis 3 verse 19.
[2817.18 --> 2818.20]  He tells them,
[2819.08 --> 2819.82]  You are dust,
[2820.52 --> 2822.02]  and to dust you shall return.
[2823.12 --> 2826.42]  And there's that echo of that verse here in Psalm 90.
[2826.56 --> 2826.60]  Right?
[2826.68 --> 2827.26]  You return,
[2827.56 --> 2829.06]  you turn people back to dust,
[2829.14 --> 2829.46]  saying,
[2829.80 --> 2831.32]  Return to dust, you mortals.
[2831.32 --> 2834.50]  So then in verses,
[2834.92 --> 2836.26]  as we keep looking in our passage,
[2836.36 --> 2837.36]  verses 5 and 6,
[2837.68 --> 2838.88]  Moses then writes this,
[2839.68 --> 2842.54]  You sweep people away in the sleep of death.
[2842.82 --> 2844.56]  They are like the new grass of the morning.
[2845.12 --> 2846.40]  In the morning it springs up,
[2846.92 --> 2848.98]  but by evening it is dry and withered.
[2848.98 --> 2852.14]  So this is this image of human life
[2852.14 --> 2853.72]  that God gives us here.
[2854.08 --> 2856.70]  It's like we're this grass that kind of sprouts up,
[2857.00 --> 2859.66]  but then fades away and withers.
[2860.30 --> 2861.94]  So we grow up quickly,
[2862.62 --> 2865.28]  and like a flower we blossom beautifully,
[2865.66 --> 2868.86]  but then we wilt and we perish.
[2868.86 --> 2871.56]  And as Psalm 103 says,
[2871.92 --> 2873.40]  the field remembers,
[2874.24 --> 2875.86]  doesn't even remember that we were there.
[2878.12 --> 2881.36]  And so what is it that actually kills the grass?
[2882.70 --> 2883.78]  Well, it's time.
[2884.36 --> 2884.54]  Right?
[2884.92 --> 2886.98]  The grass is new and fresh in the morning,
[2887.38 --> 2890.24]  but as the day lengthens into evening,
[2890.78 --> 2891.76]  it has faded.
[2892.12 --> 2893.32]  So it's the passing of time.
[2894.56 --> 2895.46]  So human beings,
[2895.56 --> 2898.40]  we're like grass that fades and withers
[2898.40 --> 2899.48]  as we get older.
[2900.52 --> 2901.76]  But isn't it interesting
[2901.76 --> 2906.36]  how time seems to speed up as we age?
[2907.74 --> 2909.66]  And so like if you ask a two-year-old
[2909.66 --> 2912.58]  to wait six months for something,
[2913.30 --> 2914.40]  you might as well tell them
[2914.40 --> 2915.50]  it's never going to happen.
[2916.00 --> 2916.40]  Right?
[2916.44 --> 2917.84]  Because that's like asking them
[2917.84 --> 2919.80]  to wait a quarter of their entire lives.
[2920.62 --> 2922.40]  But if you ask an 80-year-old
[2922.40 --> 2923.44]  to wait for six months,
[2924.36 --> 2925.14]  well, it's not a big deal.
[2925.22 --> 2926.42]  They'll be here before we know it.
[2926.42 --> 2928.80]  It doesn't seem like that much time
[2928.80 --> 2933.12]  because time speeds up as we get older.
[2934.02 --> 2936.28]  You know, one of the greatest philosophers of our age,
[2936.44 --> 2937.06]  Dr. Seuss,
[2937.44 --> 2938.56]  he puts it this way.
[2938.56 --> 2944.06]  How did it get so late so soon?
[2945.02 --> 2946.84]  It's night before it's afternoon.
[2947.98 --> 2950.10]  December is here before it's June.
[2951.00 --> 2953.48]  My goodness, how the time has flown.
[2954.36 --> 2957.48]  How did it get so late so soon?
[2960.30 --> 2960.82]  Right?
[2960.90 --> 2963.10]  He's saying like time is just slipping away
[2963.10 --> 2965.06]  through our fingers like drops of water.
[2965.06 --> 2967.72]  It's gone before you know it.
[2968.98 --> 2970.44]  Now, why is that the case?
[2970.86 --> 2970.96]  Right?
[2971.02 --> 2975.42]  Why do human beings grieve the passage of time
[2975.42 --> 2977.36]  and feel the passage of time
[2977.36 --> 2980.78]  and feel that time is so short?
[2982.20 --> 2985.72]  Well, Psalm 90 has an explanation for this.
[2986.02 --> 2987.06]  It's not a pleasant explanation,
[2987.06 --> 2989.76]  but it is a clear one.
[2990.90 --> 2993.12]  Time is short and it passes quickly by
[2993.12 --> 2996.52]  because humanity is under God's wrath.
[2997.24 --> 2999.70]  That's what it says here in verses 9 and 10.
[3000.82 --> 3001.50]  Moses writes,
[3001.50 --> 3028.92]  So Moses is saying that every human being
[3028.92 --> 3032.18]  is like a flower that has been cut.
[3033.20 --> 3034.92]  We have some cut flowers right here.
[3035.72 --> 3035.86]  Right?
[3035.90 --> 3036.94]  It's a flower that's been cut
[3036.94 --> 3038.96]  and placed in a vase of water
[3038.96 --> 3044.64]  and it's still alive-ish, kind of,
[3044.88 --> 3047.28]  but it's slowly fading.
[3047.52 --> 3048.68]  This is not going to last forever
[3048.68 --> 3051.04]  because it's not connected to the root.
[3051.92 --> 3052.04]  Right?
[3052.12 --> 3054.86]  The source is severed from the source of life.
[3054.86 --> 3056.74]  And in a similar way,
[3056.78 --> 3057.90]  because of our sin,
[3058.02 --> 3059.64]  we have been cut off
[3059.64 --> 3061.90]  from our relationship with God
[3061.90 --> 3063.46]  who is the source of life.
[3063.68 --> 3064.56]  And as a result,
[3064.72 --> 3066.12]  we, like a flower in a vase,
[3066.26 --> 3066.84]  start to die.
[3068.00 --> 3070.64]  And not only are we destined to die physically,
[3070.94 --> 3073.78]  but we live under the condemnation of God.
[3074.26 --> 3076.38]  And death is a fitting judgment
[3076.38 --> 3078.88]  of rebelling and sinning
[3078.88 --> 3080.32]  against the eternal God.
[3080.32 --> 3084.78]  And so what is Moses admitting here in this psalm?
[3085.34 --> 3087.08]  He's admitting his mortality
[3087.08 --> 3090.28]  and he's telling the truth about our lives.
[3090.40 --> 3091.36]  That time is short.
[3092.08 --> 3096.46]  And it's short because we are under God's judgment for sin.
[3097.54 --> 3099.66]  Now, thankfully, that is not the end of the psalm.
[3100.30 --> 3102.36]  And that brings us to the last point today,
[3102.44 --> 3103.84]  which is asking for grace.
[3103.84 --> 3108.38]  So, immediately, you know,
[3108.44 --> 3110.52]  first Moses, he prays in Psalm,
[3111.44 --> 3112.88]  in verse 12.
[3113.48 --> 3115.16]  He says, okay, you know, our days are short.
[3115.88 --> 3116.82]  Therefore, verse 12,
[3116.90 --> 3118.44]  teach us to number our days
[3118.44 --> 3119.80]  that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[3120.96 --> 3123.24]  And then what does he immediately start to do?
[3124.50 --> 3126.10]  He starts to ask for things.
[3126.64 --> 3128.42]  He starts to ask for multiple things
[3128.42 --> 3131.02]  in verses 13 to 17, the last part.
[3131.62 --> 3133.74]  So what are some of the things that he asks for?
[3134.62 --> 3136.06]  He says, verse 13,
[3136.46 --> 3139.98]  relent, Lord, have compassion on your servants.
[3140.66 --> 3143.32]  Verse 14, satisfy us in the morning
[3143.32 --> 3145.06]  with your unfailing love.
[3146.22 --> 3148.68]  Verse 15, make us glad.
[3149.50 --> 3153.26]  Verse 17, may the favor of our Lord rest on us.
[3154.34 --> 3155.58]  What is he saying?
[3156.34 --> 3157.76]  What is he asking for?
[3158.76 --> 3160.38]  Well, these are all things
[3160.38 --> 3162.50]  that we don't deserve.
[3162.50 --> 3163.80]  Right?
[3164.04 --> 3166.32]  Moses, he has this longing for eternity,
[3166.32 --> 3168.56]  to dwell with God forever,
[3168.72 --> 3169.72]  the everlasting God.
[3170.06 --> 3171.68]  He admits his mortality.
[3172.66 --> 3173.56]  His days are short,
[3173.76 --> 3176.06]  and they all pass under the judgment of sin.
[3176.78 --> 3177.98]  And so in response,
[3178.18 --> 3179.52]  so I have this longing for eternity.
[3179.80 --> 3181.22]  I'm under the judgment of sin.
[3181.64 --> 3184.08]  In response, he does the only thing he can do,
[3184.32 --> 3186.62]  which is simply to ask for God's grace.
[3186.62 --> 3189.30]  And ultimately, friends,
[3189.44 --> 3193.16]  God's answer to Moses' prayer for grace
[3193.16 --> 3194.74]  is Jesus.
[3195.70 --> 3195.84]  Right?
[3196.04 --> 3199.52]  Jesus is the embodiment of God's unfailing love.
[3199.52 --> 3203.68]  When Jesus was on earth,
[3204.68 --> 3206.14]  a number of times, right,
[3206.20 --> 3208.06]  the Pharisees, the religious leaders,
[3208.86 --> 3211.92]  they would question Jesus about his identity.
[3212.92 --> 3213.06]  Right?
[3213.12 --> 3215.14]  Who exactly was he?
[3215.64 --> 3217.28]  Who was he claiming to be?
[3217.62 --> 3220.08]  And one of the most scandalous ways
[3220.08 --> 3222.08]  that Jesus ever answered that question
[3222.08 --> 3223.40]  was like this.
[3223.40 --> 3225.04]  He said,
[3225.76 --> 3228.14]  Before Abraham was,
[3229.00 --> 3230.70]  I am.
[3232.04 --> 3234.78]  And what Jesus was claiming in that moment
[3234.78 --> 3236.96]  was to be eternal.
[3237.86 --> 3240.86]  Was to be the everlasting God.
[3241.22 --> 3243.48]  The God who is from everlasting to everlasting.
[3244.04 --> 3245.70]  Jesus was a mortal man
[3245.70 --> 3247.92]  who claimed to be eternal.
[3249.34 --> 3251.26]  And so Jesus, the eternal God,
[3251.54 --> 3252.54]  in becoming a man,
[3252.54 --> 3254.66]  he entered time.
[3255.82 --> 3257.94]  And he became subject
[3257.94 --> 3260.88]  to the conditions of time.
[3261.92 --> 3262.04]  Right?
[3262.08 --> 3263.68]  So Jesus was born.
[3264.94 --> 3267.32]  He grew up as a little boy.
[3268.04 --> 3268.28]  You know?
[3268.34 --> 3269.86]  And I imagine him kind of
[3269.86 --> 3271.82]  sitting in, you know,
[3272.24 --> 3274.26]  the rabbi school,
[3274.98 --> 3276.14]  waiting for the clock
[3276.14 --> 3278.10]  to get to two or three
[3278.10 --> 3279.40]  so he can get out of school.
[3279.54 --> 3279.72]  Right?
[3279.72 --> 3282.30]  And I imagine Jesus
[3282.30 --> 3284.32]  looking forward
[3284.32 --> 3285.44]  to his favorite meal
[3285.44 --> 3286.28]  on the Sabbath.
[3287.94 --> 3289.52]  And Jesus grew older.
[3290.46 --> 3291.24]  And he faced
[3291.24 --> 3292.54]  all the realities of time.
[3293.30 --> 3295.06]  And he lived by faith
[3295.06 --> 3296.66]  just as we do.
[3297.40 --> 3298.48]  He lived in hope
[3298.48 --> 3299.24]  just as we do.
[3300.36 --> 3302.46]  He learned to number his days
[3302.46 --> 3305.16]  knowing of his impending death.
[3305.16 --> 3308.34]  And then Jesus' life
[3308.34 --> 3309.22]  came to an end.
[3310.18 --> 3310.58]  Right?
[3310.62 --> 3311.86]  His life was cut off
[3311.86 --> 3313.94]  under the torture of the cross.
[3314.72 --> 3316.70]  And he breathed his last.
[3317.86 --> 3320.04]  His heart stopped beating.
[3321.04 --> 3322.20]  And he died
[3322.20 --> 3324.28]  under his father's wrath.
[3324.28 --> 3326.74]  But not because
[3326.74 --> 3328.62]  that was a judgment
[3328.62 --> 3330.28]  against his own sin.
[3330.60 --> 3331.92]  For he knew no sin.
[3332.86 --> 3334.86]  But he subjected himself
[3334.86 --> 3336.44]  to mortality
[3336.44 --> 3337.84]  in order
[3337.84 --> 3339.60]  to die in our place
[3339.60 --> 3340.64]  to give us
[3340.64 --> 3341.88]  the gift of eternal life.
[3343.02 --> 3343.14]  Right?
[3343.20 --> 3343.42]  And friends,
[3343.46 --> 3344.20]  this is the story
[3344.20 --> 3344.68]  of the Bible.
[3345.38 --> 3346.16]  That you have
[3346.16 --> 3347.20]  an eternal God
[3347.20 --> 3348.80]  and you have humanity
[3348.80 --> 3349.70]  made in the image
[3349.70 --> 3350.76]  of that eternal God
[3350.76 --> 3351.76]  made for eternity
[3351.76 --> 3352.66]  which is why
[3352.66 --> 3353.92]  every human being
[3353.92 --> 3355.08]  doesn't need to be taught
[3355.08 --> 3356.42]  to long for eternity.
[3356.88 --> 3358.38]  We just naturally do.
[3359.18 --> 3360.12]  But in our sin
[3360.12 --> 3360.72]  and rebellion
[3360.72 --> 3361.50]  against God
[3361.50 --> 3362.68]  we cut ourselves off
[3362.68 --> 3363.34]  from God
[3363.34 --> 3364.84]  and like a cut flower
[3364.84 --> 3365.44]  in a vase
[3365.44 --> 3366.40]  we are fading away
[3366.40 --> 3367.16]  in our mortality.
[3367.88 --> 3368.42]  And the way
[3368.42 --> 3369.84]  to get reconnected
[3369.84 --> 3371.40]  to the God of life
[3371.40 --> 3373.02]  is not trying
[3373.02 --> 3373.56]  to just like
[3373.56 --> 3374.90]  reattach ourselves
[3374.90 --> 3376.20]  through all manner
[3376.20 --> 3377.34]  of religious activity.
[3378.28 --> 3378.96]  But rather
[3378.96 --> 3379.94]  it is through God
[3379.94 --> 3381.04]  coming to us
[3381.04 --> 3382.88]  entering our mortality
[3382.88 --> 3384.08]  in the person of Jesus
[3384.08 --> 3385.80]  so that through him
[3385.80 --> 3387.66]  we might leave mortality
[3387.66 --> 3389.62]  and become eternal.
[3391.00 --> 3391.90]  Jesus entered
[3391.90 --> 3393.16]  into our mortality
[3393.16 --> 3394.68]  so that we might
[3394.68 --> 3395.66]  leave our mortality
[3395.66 --> 3397.04]  and become like him
[3397.04 --> 3397.92]  eternal.
[3399.58 --> 3400.52]  And so our longing
[3400.52 --> 3401.38]  for eternity
[3401.38 --> 3402.56]  the problem
[3402.56 --> 3403.84]  of our mortality
[3403.84 --> 3404.64]  is answered
[3404.64 --> 3405.62]  in the grace of God
[3405.62 --> 3406.32]  given to us
[3406.32 --> 3407.08]  in Jesus Christ.
[3408.12 --> 3409.32]  And it's the gospel
[3409.32 --> 3409.82]  therefore
[3409.82 --> 3411.10]  that teaches us
[3411.10 --> 3413.00]  to number our days
[3413.00 --> 3413.72]  so that we might
[3413.72 --> 3414.62]  gain a heart of wisdom.
[3415.36 --> 3415.58]  Right?
[3415.62 --> 3416.64]  We number each one
[3416.64 --> 3417.26]  of our days
[3417.26 --> 3418.50]  trusting in God's grace
[3418.50 --> 3419.40]  to us in Christ
[3419.40 --> 3420.38]  and living
[3420.38 --> 3421.64]  each day
[3421.64 --> 3422.36]  in light
[3422.36 --> 3423.44]  of that grace.
[3425.04 --> 3425.96]  Now what does this
[3425.96 --> 3426.50]  look like
[3426.50 --> 3427.42]  maybe a little bit
[3427.42 --> 3428.04]  more practically?
[3429.96 --> 3430.96]  Well first of all
[3430.96 --> 3431.58]  it looks like
[3431.58 --> 3432.20]  recognizing
[3432.20 --> 3434.24]  that life is short
[3434.24 --> 3435.06]  and unpredictable
[3435.06 --> 3436.44]  and having
[3436.44 --> 3437.58]  a real awareness
[3437.58 --> 3438.12]  of that.
[3439.88 --> 3440.78]  How long
[3440.78 --> 3442.10]  do you actually have?
[3443.70 --> 3444.70]  That's a good question
[3444.70 --> 3445.26]  to ask.
[3445.94 --> 3446.66]  How long
[3446.66 --> 3447.74]  do you think you have?
[3448.74 --> 3449.80]  Of course we don't know.
[3450.14 --> 3450.50]  We can't know
[3450.50 --> 3451.38]  the answer to that
[3451.38 --> 3453.06]  but there is an answer.
[3454.48 --> 3454.92]  Right?
[3454.98 --> 3455.90]  There is a number
[3455.90 --> 3456.54]  of days
[3456.54 --> 3457.68]  that God has set
[3457.68 --> 3458.62]  for each one of us.
[3458.70 --> 3459.36]  It's not random.
[3459.36 --> 3461.72]  And wisdom
[3461.72 --> 3463.54]  is to live
[3463.54 --> 3465.28]  with that awareness.
[3466.50 --> 3467.48]  That time is limited.
[3469.06 --> 3470.28]  Here's another question
[3470.28 --> 3471.50]  that's worth thinking about.
[3472.62 --> 3473.94]  What would you like
[3473.94 --> 3474.88]  to be doing
[3474.88 --> 3475.92]  when you die?
[3477.06 --> 3477.92]  Like not necessarily
[3477.92 --> 3478.64]  on that day.
[3478.82 --> 3479.54]  We don't know the day
[3479.54 --> 3480.34]  but what would you
[3480.34 --> 3481.74]  like your life
[3481.74 --> 3482.80]  to look like?
[3483.56 --> 3484.84]  What kind of person
[3484.84 --> 3486.34]  do you want
[3486.34 --> 3487.20]  to be?
[3487.20 --> 3489.64]  So here's what
[3489.64 --> 3490.40]  we're talking about.
[3490.46 --> 3491.18]  We're talking about
[3491.18 --> 3493.38]  living with urgency
[3493.38 --> 3494.54]  without anxiety.
[3494.84 --> 3495.42]  Let's put those words.
[3497.10 --> 3497.58]  Urgency
[3497.58 --> 3499.70]  without anxiety.
[3500.26 --> 3501.26]  That's what it looks like
[3501.26 --> 3502.22]  to number our days.
[3502.96 --> 3504.46]  What does it look like
[3504.46 --> 3505.32]  to be urgent?
[3506.42 --> 3507.42]  It means to know
[3507.42 --> 3508.78]  what your priorities are.
[3509.96 --> 3510.12]  You know,
[3510.20 --> 3511.56]  time is of the essence
[3511.56 --> 3512.76]  and it's to live
[3512.76 --> 3514.04]  in line
[3514.04 --> 3515.96]  with those priorities.
[3517.20 --> 3518.30]  And you know what?
[3518.34 --> 3519.32]  There's a popular
[3519.32 --> 3520.38]  kind of cultural
[3520.38 --> 3521.86]  version of this, right?
[3522.70 --> 3523.44]  You know what it's called?
[3524.94 --> 3525.98]  The bucket list.
[3526.62 --> 3527.54]  You know the bucket list.
[3528.30 --> 3529.06]  And so what is that?
[3529.10 --> 3529.80]  You have an awareness
[3529.80 --> 3530.62]  that time is short.
[3531.42 --> 3532.20]  One day we're all
[3532.20 --> 3532.82]  going to what?
[3533.80 --> 3534.50]  Kick the bucket
[3534.50 --> 3536.14]  as the saying goes.
[3536.32 --> 3537.02]  So what do you do?
[3537.60 --> 3538.70]  You try to squeeze
[3538.70 --> 3539.56]  in all the things
[3539.56 --> 3540.80]  you've ever wanted to do
[3540.80 --> 3542.42]  as fast as you can
[3542.42 --> 3543.54]  to kind of wring
[3543.54 --> 3544.70]  every last drop
[3544.70 --> 3546.24]  out of this life.
[3546.24 --> 3549.06]  But that's actually
[3549.06 --> 3550.42]  not what we're talking about
[3550.42 --> 3552.56]  because that is urgency
[3552.56 --> 3554.98]  with anxiety.
[3556.26 --> 3556.74]  Right?
[3556.78 --> 3558.24]  That's living with urgency
[3558.24 --> 3562.16]  without eternity in mind.
[3562.84 --> 3563.04]  Right?
[3563.10 --> 3563.80]  I mean, that is not
[3563.80 --> 3564.92]  the posture of a Christian.
[3566.04 --> 3566.24]  Right?
[3566.24 --> 3567.50]  To live with urgency
[3567.50 --> 3569.52]  but without anxiety
[3569.52 --> 3571.60]  is not to check off
[3571.60 --> 3573.32]  experiences on a bucket list.
[3573.32 --> 3574.82]  is to do
[3574.82 --> 3576.04]  and to embody
[3576.04 --> 3577.02]  what Anne Lamont
[3577.02 --> 3578.68]  means when she writes this.
[3579.48 --> 3581.52]  How we spend our days
[3581.52 --> 3583.14]  is of course
[3583.14 --> 3585.42]  how we spend our lives.
[3586.88 --> 3587.86]  So it's a reminder
[3587.86 --> 3589.06]  to say that I
[3589.06 --> 3591.42]  might just have today.
[3592.14 --> 3593.92]  And if I was to die today
[3593.92 --> 3595.18]  I would like to be living
[3595.18 --> 3596.04]  in a certain way.
[3596.04 --> 3597.84]  And so that means
[3597.84 --> 3598.80]  like in our relationships
[3598.80 --> 3600.92]  to try to speak
[3600.92 --> 3604.38]  with people in our lives
[3604.38 --> 3605.78]  in the most gracious way
[3605.78 --> 3606.50]  that we can.
[3606.98 --> 3607.98]  We're never perfect.
[3608.86 --> 3610.10]  But to endeavor
[3610.10 --> 3612.28]  to speak beautiful
[3612.28 --> 3613.18]  and gracious words
[3613.18 --> 3614.62]  because anything I say
[3614.62 --> 3615.92]  might be the last thing I say.
[3616.86 --> 3617.98]  And I would never want
[3617.98 --> 3619.04]  the last thing I say
[3619.04 --> 3620.04]  to be anger
[3620.78 --> 3622.34]  or impatience.
[3622.34 --> 3625.22]  And I want to be living
[3625.22 --> 3626.02]  in a way
[3626.02 --> 3627.66]  that is pleasing to God.
[3628.04 --> 3629.54]  Where every single thing I do
[3629.54 --> 3630.74]  is like an act of worship
[3630.74 --> 3632.08]  to God.
[3632.68 --> 3633.84]  To bring God glory
[3633.84 --> 3634.58]  in everything I do.
[3634.66 --> 3635.48]  You certainly don't want to
[3635.48 --> 3636.52]  like what's the biggest
[3636.52 --> 3638.42]  reason to not sin?
[3639.46 --> 3641.16]  You don't want to die sinning.
[3641.84 --> 3642.32]  Right?
[3642.42 --> 3642.66]  That's
[3642.66 --> 3644.14]  that's terrible.
[3644.98 --> 3645.86]  So okay
[3645.86 --> 3647.04]  you don't know when you're going to die
[3647.04 --> 3647.62]  so don't sin.
[3648.08 --> 3648.18]  Right?
[3648.30 --> 3649.66]  Live every moment
[3649.66 --> 3650.32]  every day
[3650.32 --> 3651.48]  for God's glory.
[3651.48 --> 3652.96]  keeping his commandments.
[3654.20 --> 3654.40]  Right?
[3654.48 --> 3655.28]  And so we can live
[3655.28 --> 3656.12]  whether it's working
[3656.12 --> 3656.72]  or resting
[3656.72 --> 3657.80]  or playing
[3657.80 --> 3660.18]  in light of
[3660.18 --> 3662.04]  who God made us.
[3662.86 --> 3663.88]  And what if we have
[3663.88 --> 3664.86]  lots of days?
[3665.92 --> 3666.22]  Well
[3666.22 --> 3667.86]  the cumulative total
[3667.86 --> 3669.00]  of all those days
[3669.00 --> 3670.88]  that is my life.
[3672.84 --> 3674.20]  And so I'm not actually
[3674.20 --> 3674.96]  even just thinking
[3674.96 --> 3675.82]  about each day
[3675.82 --> 3676.10]  but
[3676.10 --> 3677.68]  knowing that I might
[3677.68 --> 3678.88]  have thousands of days
[3678.88 --> 3680.92]  I can invest in things
[3680.92 --> 3681.76]  that I might never
[3681.76 --> 3682.50]  live to see
[3682.50 --> 3683.98]  and yet have this
[3683.98 --> 3684.68]  kind of urgency
[3684.68 --> 3685.64]  to begin now
[3685.64 --> 3687.18]  because I might
[3687.18 --> 3687.96]  just have today.
[3689.30 --> 3690.06]  And so a heart
[3690.06 --> 3690.60]  of wisdom
[3690.60 --> 3691.44]  looks like this
[3691.44 --> 3692.80]  kind of urgency
[3692.80 --> 3694.56]  living each day
[3694.56 --> 3695.20]  for God
[3695.20 --> 3696.02]  as if it might be
[3696.02 --> 3696.56]  your last
[3696.56 --> 3697.66]  but you're not anxious
[3697.66 --> 3698.26]  about it.
[3699.70 --> 3700.22]  Right?
[3700.30 --> 3700.96]  You're just
[3700.96 --> 3702.90]  investing in eternity.
[3703.12 --> 3703.44]  You're living
[3703.44 --> 3704.30]  for God's glory.
[3704.84 --> 3705.28]  And that's what
[3705.28 --> 3706.52]  that's the Christian
[3706.52 --> 3707.14]  way to live.
[3707.14 --> 3709.30]  Now just as we
[3709.30 --> 3709.68]  conclude
[3709.68 --> 3710.36]  I want to illustrate
[3710.36 --> 3711.26]  this with a story
[3711.26 --> 3712.70]  that I heard recently
[3712.70 --> 3713.98]  because Valentine's Day
[3713.98 --> 3714.54]  was just
[3714.54 --> 3715.50]  like the other week
[3715.50 --> 3715.72]  right?
[3716.78 --> 3717.26]  So
[3717.26 --> 3718.12]  Saint Valentine
[3718.12 --> 3719.72]  was a priest
[3719.72 --> 3720.34]  in Rome
[3720.34 --> 3721.96]  during the hostile
[3721.96 --> 3723.04]  reign of Emperor
[3723.04 --> 3723.84]  Claudius II
[3723.84 --> 3724.58]  and this is the
[3724.58 --> 3725.24]  third century.
[3725.96 --> 3726.92]  He was arrested
[3726.92 --> 3727.70]  and he was put
[3727.70 --> 3728.18]  in prison
[3728.18 --> 3729.22]  during the persecution
[3729.22 --> 3729.80]  of Christians.
[3730.82 --> 3731.64]  And while he was
[3731.64 --> 3733.06]  awaiting his sentence
[3733.06 --> 3734.06]  Valentine
[3734.06 --> 3734.98]  befriended
[3734.98 --> 3735.92]  the jailer's daughter.
[3735.92 --> 3737.38]  and this young girl
[3737.38 --> 3738.60]  was blind and sick
[3738.60 --> 3740.10]  and Valentine
[3740.10 --> 3742.08]  prayed for her healing
[3742.08 --> 3743.20]  and she was healed
[3743.20 --> 3743.84]  and her sight
[3743.84 --> 3744.48]  was restored.
[3745.62 --> 3746.14]  Now Valentine
[3746.14 --> 3746.96]  was eventually
[3746.96 --> 3748.26]  sentenced to death
[3748.26 --> 3749.76]  because he would not
[3749.76 --> 3751.00]  worship the emperor
[3751.00 --> 3752.06]  and he wouldn't
[3752.06 --> 3753.36]  denounce Christ.
[3754.04 --> 3754.72]  And on the morning
[3754.72 --> 3755.68]  of his execution
[3755.68 --> 3757.48]  he wrote a letter
[3757.48 --> 3758.28]  of encouragement
[3758.28 --> 3760.20]  blessing this little girl
[3760.20 --> 3762.14]  and he signed it
[3762.14 --> 3762.72]  how?
[3762.72 --> 3763.98]  from
[3763.98 --> 3765.10]  your
[3765.10 --> 3766.22]  Valentine.
[3767.74 --> 3768.58]  And this is the note
[3768.58 --> 3769.24]  that is said to have
[3769.24 --> 3770.22]  inspired that common
[3770.22 --> 3770.58]  greeting
[3770.58 --> 3771.74]  that many of us
[3771.74 --> 3772.38]  exchange
[3772.38 --> 3773.50]  on Valentine's Day.
[3774.32 --> 3775.32]  But what I love
[3775.32 --> 3776.26]  about this story
[3776.26 --> 3777.04]  is even
[3777.04 --> 3778.34]  as Valentine
[3778.34 --> 3779.36]  was facing
[3779.36 --> 3780.16]  his own death
[3780.16 --> 3782.18]  he wasn't anxious
[3782.18 --> 3784.26]  yet he still
[3784.26 --> 3784.76]  lived
[3784.76 --> 3785.50]  with a sense
[3785.50 --> 3786.12]  of urgency.
[3787.00 --> 3787.34]  Right?
[3787.40 --> 3788.46]  He lived his last
[3788.46 --> 3789.04]  day
[3789.04 --> 3790.32]  in light of eternity
[3790.32 --> 3792.34]  living for God's glory
[3792.34 --> 3793.70]  by writing to this
[3793.70 --> 3794.28]  little girl
[3794.28 --> 3794.96]  even though
[3794.96 --> 3795.92]  she was the daughter
[3795.92 --> 3796.72]  of the person
[3796.72 --> 3798.00]  who was actually
[3798.00 --> 3799.02]  keeping him locked up.
[3800.80 --> 3801.30]  And so friends
[3801.30 --> 3802.24]  the practice of
[3802.24 --> 3804.78]  remembering your death
[3804.78 --> 3807.52]  numbering our days
[3807.52 --> 3809.00]  so that we can gain
[3809.00 --> 3809.82]  a heart of wisdom
[3809.82 --> 3811.52]  makes us into
[3811.52 --> 3812.38]  the kind of person
[3812.38 --> 3813.10]  who lives
[3813.10 --> 3813.46]  with this
[3813.46 --> 3814.92]  non-anxious
[3814.92 --> 3816.06]  urgency.
[3816.06 --> 3819.72]  So let's pray
[3819.72 --> 3820.78]  that God would make us
[3820.78 --> 3821.94]  those kind of people.
[3822.14 --> 3822.48]  Let's pray.
[3825.38 --> 3826.22]  Heavenly Father
[3826.22 --> 3826.96]  we would like
[3826.96 --> 3827.92]  to be people
[3827.92 --> 3829.34]  that are
[3829.34 --> 3830.78]  wide awake
[3830.78 --> 3831.24]  and alert
[3831.24 --> 3832.34]  to our own mortality
[3832.34 --> 3834.22]  wide awake
[3834.22 --> 3835.16]  to our longing
[3835.16 --> 3836.00]  for eternity
[3836.00 --> 3838.20]  and at peace
[3838.20 --> 3838.90]  in you
[3838.90 --> 3840.22]  by your grace.
[3841.26 --> 3842.00]  We would like
[3842.00 --> 3843.12]  to live with urgency
[3843.12 --> 3844.16]  without anxiety
[3844.16 --> 3845.86]  and we can't do this
[3845.86 --> 3846.40]  on our own.
[3847.28 --> 3848.04]  So Holy Spirit
[3848.04 --> 3848.68]  would you come
[3848.68 --> 3849.50]  and would you help us
[3849.50 --> 3850.42]  to become more like
[3850.42 --> 3851.18]  our Lord Jesus.
[3852.38 --> 3853.38]  Help us we pray
[3853.38 --> 3854.14]  in his name
[3854.14 --> 3855.00]  and for his glory.
[3855.54 --> 3855.80]  Amen.
[3858.70 --> 3859.56]  Let's stand
[3859.56 --> 3860.20]  and
[3860.20 --> 3861.36]  I want to
[3861.36 --> 3862.34]  introduce
[3862.34 --> 3863.42]  a song to you
[3863.42 --> 3864.26]  well Paul will play it
[3864.26 --> 3864.86]  for us of course.
[3865.24 --> 3865.82]  It's called
[3865.82 --> 3867.66]  On Jordan Stormy Banks.
[3867.80 --> 3868.32]  Let's stand
[3868.32 --> 3868.78]  and we'll sing
[3868.78 --> 3869.34]  this new song.
[3869.34 --> 3869.40]  Amen.
[3874.16 --> 3887.00]  On Jordan Stormy Banks I stand
[3887.00 --> 3891.86]  and cast the wish
[3891.86 --> 3906.38]  wishful eyes
[3906.38 --> 3909.56]  To Cain and Spare
[3909.56 --> 3911.38]  and Plenty
[3911.38 --> 3916.98]  Where my possessions lie
[3916.98 --> 3918.98]  I am found
[3918.98 --> 3919.98]  I am found
[3919.98 --> 3920.98]  I am found
[3920.98 --> 3921.98]  I am found
[3921.98 --> 3923.98]  I am found
[3923.98 --> 3924.98]  I am found
[3924.98 --> 3926.98]  For the promised land
[3926.98 --> 3928.98]  I am found
[3928.98 --> 3929.98]  I am found
[3929.98 --> 3931.98]  I am found
[3931.98 --> 3951.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[3951.28 --> 3963.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[3963.28 --> 3978.28]  No chilling mistletoe, wise man can reach that helpful soul.
[3978.28 --> 3989.28]  Sickness of pain and doom, I'm bound and here no more.
[3989.28 --> 4013.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4013.28 --> 4026.28]  When shall I freeze the happy place to be forever last?
[4026.28 --> 4038.28]  When shall I see my Father's peace and hear His glory of heaven?
[4038.28 --> 4051.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4051.28 --> 4062.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4062.28 --> 4075.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4075.28 --> 4086.28]  I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4086.28 --> 4099.28]  I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
[4099.28 --> 4100.28]  I am bound for the promised land.
[4100.28 --> 4105.28]  So we'll now worship the Lord through the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4105.28 --> 4110.28]  And as was already introduced, the offering for today is for World Renew Canadian Food Grains Bank.
[4110.28 --> 4112.28]  Again, it's a matching of four to one.
[4112.28 --> 4117.28]  And so may I invite or ask the deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[4117.28 --> 4128.28]  I'd like to play today a song that some may know and may be new to others.
[4128.28 --> 4136.28]  It's from actually a Christian oratorial by John Stainer and probably a hundred, a hundred and ten years old.
[4136.28 --> 4141.28]  And the words of this are simply John 3.16.
[4141.28 --> 4147.28]  So if you haven't heard this before, just kind of recite that verse in your mind.
[4147.28 --> 4152.28]  And as a musician, I enjoy improvising on a song.
[4152.28 --> 4160.28]  But the harmonies of this particular one akin to a few other hymns, they're just so pure and attractive as they are.
[4160.28 --> 4164.28]  I'd like to just share this with you. God so loved the world.
[4171.28 --> 4180.28]  God so loved the world.
[4180.28 --> 4181.28]  If you haven't heard this before we follow you go your word and say you heard about them.
[4181.28 --> 4185.28]  At this time, we will not have Korean people making many achievements.
[4185.28 --> 4187.16]  And although it is done, weес çıkar and not have Korean people
[4187.16 --> 4190.28]  To love and have Korean people making many fifty�member and their arrives yes and their once again upon any пошipping.
[4190.28 --> 4191.28]  And then even though I want to sell as they are, they are not a living here.
[4191.28 --> 4194.28]  God so loved the world.
[4194.28 --> 4196.28]  The素critical version of this before, just kind ofchanical Menge —
[4196.28 --> 4198.28]  Amen.
[4226.28 --> 4228.28]  Amen.
[4256.28 --> 4258.28]  Amen.
[4286.28 --> 4288.28]  Amen.
[4316.28 --> 4318.28]  Amen.
[4346.28 --> 4376.16]  It's very beautiful.
[4376.28 --> 4377.86]  Thanks for sharing that with us.
[4378.72 --> 4382.98]  So now let's bring our needs before the Lord who always listens to us.
[4384.32 --> 4385.34]  Please pray with me.
[4386.66 --> 4388.62]  And we'll end our prayer with the Lord's Prayer.
[4391.06 --> 4394.32]  Lord, we come before you with all of our needs.
[4395.06 --> 4401.16]  Lord, you know each one of them before the words are even on our mouths,
[4401.30 --> 4404.64]  before the thoughts are even in our minds and our hearts.
[4404.64 --> 4412.72]  And Lord, we thank you for always listening to our prayers and acting and working in the world through our prayers.
[4413.56 --> 4417.76]  Father, we pray for this world of renew food grains bank.
[4417.76 --> 4427.30]  Lord, we ask that you would use it to bring flourishing and blessing to many people who need it, Lord,
[4427.46 --> 4430.08]  who struggle with food insecurity.
[4431.14 --> 4438.42]  Lord, would you provide food to supply life?
[4438.42 --> 4444.24]  And would you also, Lord, provide the bread of life, our Lord Jesus, to hungry souls as well.
[4445.78 --> 4451.82]  Lord, we lift up those among us who are suffering in mind, body, or spirit.
[4451.82 --> 4463.18]  Lord, we pray for continued healing of Jackie, of Dave, Eileen, Shirley, Tawny, Lord,
[4463.22 --> 4467.50]  and many who are struggling in different ways with pain or suffering.
[4467.50 --> 4476.94]  Lord, we also pray for your continued ministry of comfort for Jerry, Jason, Lord,
[4477.00 --> 4481.98]  all of the Culin family who mourn the recent death of Sonia.
[4483.18 --> 4493.88]  Lord, would you give them and would you give us the hope in your promise of everlasting life through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4493.88 --> 4501.22]  Lord, we know that you are a God who is compassionate and gracious and abounding in love.
[4502.12 --> 4506.68]  But we know that you are also holy and you will not leave the guilty unpunished.
[4507.54 --> 4511.50]  We know that evil will not have the last word over your good creation.
[4511.88 --> 4517.60]  And Lord, we turn to you and we look to you because of that.
[4518.72 --> 4522.42]  And Lord, we are grieved by the brokenness we see in the world around us,
[4522.42 --> 4532.74]  the effects of sin and death and the ways that we and others around us bring injustice into the world in both large and small ways.
[4533.78 --> 4541.96]  So, Lord, we pray that you would bring your kingdom and your perfect justice to this world that so badly needs it.
[4542.92 --> 4546.24]  Lord, we think of all the places that are war-torn,
[4546.98 --> 4550.34]  all the places where people are fleeing for their lives.
[4550.34 --> 4557.28]  And Lord, we pray, Lord, that you would come quickly and that you would bring your kingdom of justice.
[4557.78 --> 4560.38]  We pray that you would restrain evil in the meanwhile
[4560.38 --> 4564.88]  and that we would learn to walk in your ways
[4564.88 --> 4566.44]  and work for,
[4569.08 --> 4571.44]  partner with you in the building of your kingdom,
[4572.02 --> 4575.76]  which you are doing even now in the inauguration of Jesus,
[4575.76 --> 4576.76]  that you are doing even now in the building of Jesus.
[4576.76 --> 4584.12]  And Lord, we now pray together the prayer that Jesus taught us to pray,
[4584.12 --> 4585.36]  saying together,
[4585.36 --> 4587.68]  Our Father who art in heaven,
[4587.68 --> 4589.76]  Hallowed be thy name.
[4589.76 --> 4591.40]  Thy kingdom come,
[4591.40 --> 4592.90]  Thy will be done,
[4592.90 --> 4594.96]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[4595.20 --> 4597.74]  Give us this day our daily bread,
[4597.74 --> 4600.24]  and forgive us our trespasses,
[4600.24 --> 4603.80]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4603.80 --> 4605.98]  And lead us not into temptation,
[4606.46 --> 4608.04]  but deliver us from evil.
[4608.46 --> 4609.94]  For thine is the kingdom,
[4610.46 --> 4611.10]  and the power,
[4611.58 --> 4613.68]  and the glory forever and ever.
[4614.30 --> 4614.66]  Amen.
[4616.10 --> 4616.88]  Let's stand,
[4616.96 --> 4620.48]  and we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4621.96 --> 4623.82]  And then we will sing our final song,
[4623.92 --> 4626.38]  and I want to invite you to join us for a time of fellowship
[4626.38 --> 4628.18]  in our fellowship hall afterwards
[4628.18 --> 4630.14]  to get to know one another,
[4630.30 --> 4631.80]  spend a little time catching up on our week.
