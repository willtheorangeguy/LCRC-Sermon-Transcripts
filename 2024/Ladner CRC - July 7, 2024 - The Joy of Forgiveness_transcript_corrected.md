[329.76 → 336.76] A day when doubtless there's a lot of people out enjoying creation in their campers and
[336.76 → 339.76] yeah just enjoying the great outdoors.
[339.76 → 347.76] But we are here, and we are going to worship together the one only true God and that's
[347.76 → 348.76] what we're here for.
[348.76 → 353.76] So welcome whether you're here in person or whether you're joining us on live stream.

[392.76 → 401.76] that next week we have hospital singing at Delta View, Mountain View.
[401.76 → 404.76] I always get those two mixed up, Mountain View.
[404.76 → 408.76] So that's at 2 o'clock next Sunday after the service.
[408.76 → 414.76] We have an invitation to worship that comes to us from John 6 verse 35.
[414.76 → 419.76] Then Jesus declared, I am the bread of life.
[419.76 → 427.76] Whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
[427.76 → 432.76] Will you pray with me?
[432.76 → 435.76] Earth cannot contain your glory Lord.
[435.76 → 438.76] You alone are worthy of our praise.
[438.76 → 443.76] You provide the rain for the earth's seeds and fill us with good things.
[443.76 → 450.76] You welcome us into your family as sons and daughters so that we are no longer homeless strangers, but we belong.
[450.76 → 453.76] You lavish your extravagant love on us.
[453.76 → 457.76] You are compassionate, just, and holy.

[463.76 → 464.76] Amen.

[475.76 → 483.76] Blessed are you who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for you will be filled.
[483.76 → 488.76] And as we've been greeted by God, will you greet one another.

[776.44 → 800.44] Amen.

[815.62 → 837.24] He is exalted, the King is exalted on high
[837.24 → 842.84] And I praise Him, He is exalted forever

[852.02 → 861.02] He is the Lord, forever His truth shall reign
[861.02 → 869.02] Heaven and earth, rejoice in His holy name
[869.02 → 878.20] He is exalted, the King is exalted on high
[878.20 → 887.38] He is exalted, the King is exalted to me
[887.38 → 890.38] He is exalted to me
[890.38 → 897.38] He is exalted to me
[897.38 → 906.56] He is exalted to me
[906.56 → 908.56] He is exalted, the King is exalted to me
[908.56 → 920.96] He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[924.02 → 929.72] He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[932.68 → 934.02] You may be seated.
[938.56 → 958.82] Today, Pastor Jason is going to help us unpack Psalm 32 with an emphasis on the joy that forgiveness brings.
[958.82 → 969.22] The pathway to forgiveness from God includes confession of our sins, which releases us from guilt.
[969.92 → 973.96] Guilt festers and becomes an infection that spreads through us.
[974.90 → 977.52] Coming clean brings deep relief.
[979.02 → 980.96] I remember this as a child.
[980.96 → 988.12] I don't remember exactly what I did, and maybe if I did remember, I wouldn't admit it, but I did something that I knew was wrong.
[989.20 → 996.08] And as a child, I was afraid to go to my mother and tell her, and I really didn't want to.
[996.14 → 1003.44] I didn't want to tell her what I had done because I felt ashamed, and I felt, because I knew that I wasn't supposed to do that.
[1003.44 → 1005.84] So, yeah, I was guilty.
[1006.72 → 1013.84] So, I didn't tell her for a while, but it kept eating at me and eating at me, and finally I couldn't stand it.
[1014.26 → 1016.60] And I went to her, and I told her.
[1017.38 → 1024.96] She graciously forgave me and told me how important it was to come out with the truth.
[1024.96 → 1029.44] And I wonder, kids that are here, have you ever done that?
[1030.16 → 1037.10] Have you ever done something and tried to keep it from the person you should tell?
[1038.00 → 1039.54] What about us adults?
[1039.70 → 1040.68] Have you ever done that?
[1041.46 → 1043.46] We know how that makes us feel.
[1043.46 → 1052.68] This is when my mother forgave me, and when I went to her.
[1052.80 → 1057.04] This is what we do when we are honest with God about our sin.
[1057.92 → 1060.50] So, will you join me in a prayer of confession?
[1064.12 → 1071.66] Holy Father, you tell us that if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[1071.66 → 1078.44] We come to you now in honesty, to confess our sin in quietness before you.
[1093.44 → 1099.78] Thank you, gracious God, for removing our guilt and shame through the work Jesus accomplished through his suffering and death.
[1099.78 → 1102.90] We give you all the glory and praise.
[1103.62 → 1103.92] Amen.
[1105.98 → 1108.48] And this is the promise for us.
[1109.30 → 1115.12] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins.
[1115.78 → 1118.78] Not only that, he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[1119.96 → 1122.26] And that's found in 1 John 1, verse 9.
[1123.30 → 1124.34] Let's sing together.
[1124.52 → 1126.08] And if you're able, please stand again.
[1126.08 → 1126.14] Amen.
[1129.78 → 1131.12] Amen.
[1131.12 → 1134.88] Amen.
[1136.24 → 1136.88] Amen.
[1137.32 → 1137.38] Amen.

[1157.36 → 1157.92] Amen.
[1157.92 → 1158.78] Amen.
[1158.78 → 1171.48] What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[1171.48 → 1177.80] There is no more for heaven not to give.
[1178.38 → 1183.38] He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[1183.38 → 1189.86] My strength is love, my secret and powerless peace.
[1190.44 → 1195.46] To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1196.02 → 1202.12] For my life is only bound to Him.
[1202.80 → 1207.22] Oh how strange and divine I can see.

[1271.22 → 1285.22] Oh, the chains are released, I can sing, I am free in our life, but through Christ in me.
[1285.22 → 1287.22] You may be seated.
[1293.22 → 1322.84] So, the Apostles' Creed is just such a great summary of what we as Christians believe.
[1322.84 → 1332.12] So, as we come to the Lord's table this morning, let us proclaim, let us confess our faith together with the words of the Apostles' Creed.
[1332.38 → 1333.38] So, let's say it together.
[1334.22 → 1340.58] I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1341.38 → 1351.14] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1351.14 → 1357.58] He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1358.30 → 1359.84] He descended to hell.
[1360.66 → 1363.62] The third day, he rose again from the dead.
[1364.14 → 1370.08] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[1371.12 → 1375.10] From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1375.10 → 1390.60] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
[1390.60 → 1396.82] The Lord's Supper is a meal of comfort.
[1397.66 → 1400.30] And it is a meal of strength.
[1401.00 → 1405.56] And we celebrate the Lord's Supper because our Lord Jesus commanded us to.
[1406.40 → 1409.40] And in one sense, it's like a time machine.
[1409.40 → 1415.60] It takes us back 2,000 years ago to the cross of Christ.
[1416.52 → 1420.18] Jesus on the cross giving his life for us.
[1420.26 → 1423.04] And the bread represents his broken body.
[1423.54 → 1428.50] The cup represents his shed blood for the forgiveness of all of our sins.
[1429.30 → 1433.48] But it's not only a remembrance of something that happened in the past historically,
[1433.96 → 1437.92] but it's also something that we can experience right now in the present.
[1437.92 → 1444.08] In John 6, I think it's the very passage that Marian used as her call to worship,
[1444.24 → 1444.78] Jesus said,
[1445.00 → 1446.36] I am the bread of life.
[1447.34 → 1449.48] Whoever comes to me will never be hungry.
[1450.28 → 1453.32] Whoever believes in me will never thirst.
[1454.74 → 1463.10] And so as we partake of this meal, we are renewed in a sense of God's love for us.
[1463.68 → 1467.56] He nourishes our souls as we feed upon him by faith.
[1467.92 → 1472.64] But then, not only is this, there's a past and there's a present aspect,
[1472.96 → 1474.38] there's also a future aspect.
[1475.44 → 1480.74] And we remember Jesus is coming again, and he will come, and he will renew all things.
[1481.56 → 1483.80] And so we will rejoice in him.
[1484.12 → 1488.96] We will eat and drink in his presence where there will be no more hunger.
[1488.96 → 1492.42] Now, who is to come to the Lord's table?
[1492.92 → 1493.04] Right?
[1493.10 → 1494.42] Who is this supper for?
[1495.08 → 1499.02] It is for those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ.
[1499.64 → 1506.24] It is for those who, by God's grace, recognize that they are sinners in the sight of a holy and perfect God.
[1506.24 → 1511.66] They believe that Jesus died for their sins to forgive them.
[1512.22 → 1521.52] And then they have turned in repentance and confession and faith to receive what Jesus has done for us by dying to forgive us.
[1521.96 → 1525.14] And we have committed ourselves to Christ to follow him.
[1525.14 → 1530.36] And you have been baptized into the church, whether this church or another one.
[1531.24 → 1537.04] And so if that describes you today, you are welcome to join us in this meal.
[1537.90 → 1541.32] But if that does not yet describe your relationship to God,
[1541.92 → 1545.88] then the supper isn't yet for you, at least not for today.
[1546.64 → 1550.80] And it's our hope and prayer that you will be able to take the supper with us soon.
[1550.80 → 1561.60] Now, speaking to the parents, we believe that if your children have an age-appropriate knowledge of their sin and of their Saviour,
[1562.08 → 1567.08] then they are welcome to come to the table if you believe that they are ready with your permission.
[1568.74 → 1571.12] So now hear these words of institution.
[1571.98 → 1575.22] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1575.66 → 1578.40] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1578.40 → 1580.58] And this is my body, which is for you.
[1581.26 → 1583.76] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1584.66 → 1588.18] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1588.30 → 1591.16] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1592.10 → 1595.92] Whenever you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1596.50 → 1599.52] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1599.56 → 1603.46] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1603.46 → 1606.88] So brothers and sisters, as we say,
[1607.04 → 1610.60] These are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[1611.48 → 1615.94] Take them, feed on Christ by faith in your hearts,
[1616.18 → 1617.90] with Thanksgiving and with joy,
[1618.32 → 1619.80] because Christ has died for you.
[1623.50 → 1626.14] Let's pray as we come to this meal together.
[1626.14 → 1634.74] Lord, as Jesus stood on that mountain, and he broke bread, and he gave it to the crowds of people,
[1634.86 → 1636.06] but first he thanked you.
[1637.02 → 1642.36] Lord, we come, and we give you gratitude for the broken body,
[1642.58 → 1644.00] the shed blood of our Lord Jesus.
[1644.56 → 1650.00] We thank you so much for this meal and the invitation that you offer to us.
[1650.00 → 1652.46] We thank you for all it represents,
[1652.46 → 1654.84] your body given for us,
[1655.04 → 1657.44] and your bloodshed for the forgiveness of our sins.
[1658.20 → 1660.54] So now as we eat and drink in faith,
[1661.16 → 1664.64] we pray that you would comfort and strengthen us by your grace.
[1665.52 → 1667.76] We pray that we would respond
[1667.76 → 1670.80] in thanks for all that you have done for us,
[1670.92 → 1673.60] so that we would know anew and in a fresh way,
[1673.68 → 1674.64] in a deeper way,
[1675.04 → 1677.26] your deep love for us.
[1677.26 → 1679.80] to know who we are,
[1679.98 → 1681.66] sons and daughters of the King,
[1682.66 → 1683.96] through Christ our Lord.
[1684.48 → 1686.56] We pray in Jesus' wonderful name.
[1687.40 → 1687.70] Amen.
[1689.28 → 1694.72] May I invite our elders who are serving to come up and help me distribute the elements.
[1699.48 → 1702.24] Friends, as the elements are being distributed,
[1702.24 → 1707.10] this is a time for you to meditate on the Lord,
[1707.20 → 1708.34] what Jesus has done for you,
[1708.40 → 1709.22] to pray to him.
[1710.54 → 1712.34] And so it's a time for you to commune with God.
[1712.34 → 1712.44] Amen.
[1712.44 → 1712.46] Amen.
[1712.46 → 1712.54] Amen.
[1712.54 → 1712.56] Amen.
[1712.56 → 1712.62] Amen.
[1712.62 → 1712.64] Amen.
[1712.64 → 1712.66] Amen.
[1712.66 → 1712.68] Amen.
[1712.68 → 1712.70] Amen.
[1712.70 → 1712.74] Amen.
[1712.74 → 1712.76] Amen.
[1732.24 → 1744.70] Amen.
[1744.70 → 1745.48] Amen.
[1745.48 → 1746.56] Amen.
[1746.58 → 1746.70] Amen.
[1746.70 → 1746.98] Amen.

[2203.78 → 2210.78] All right.
[2210.78 → 2211.78] No.
[2211.78 → 2212.78] Are we on?
[2212.78 → 2213.78] Right now?
[2213.78 → 2214.78] Okay.
[2214.78 → 2215.78] How's everyone doing?
[2215.78 → 2216.78] Summer break.
[2216.78 → 2218.78] Are you enjoying it so far?
[2218.78 → 2219.78] Water fight.
[2219.78 → 2222.78] Water fight is a fun thing to do in the summer.
[2222.78 → 2228.78] You too?
[2228.78 → 2230.78] All right.
[2230.78 → 2232.78] So I want to...
[2232.78 → 2233.78] Hey, guys.
[2233.78 → 2234.78] Hey.
[2234.78 → 2236.78] Guys, over here, listen.
[2236.78 → 2239.78] I want to talk to you about something today.
[2239.78 → 2241.78] You know what it is?
[2241.78 → 2244.78] First, I want to share one verse with you.
[2244.78 → 2246.78] I'll ask you a question.
[2246.78 → 2248.78] How many gods are there?
[2248.78 → 2249.78] Only one.
[2249.78 → 2251.78] Oh, you guys are smart.
[2251.78 → 2253.78] Only one God, right?
[2253.78 → 2254.78] So that's what the Bible teaches.
[2254.78 → 2258.78] There's one true God that we worship.
[2258.78 → 2268.78] So there's a very, very, very important verse in the Bible that all children who were Hebrews would know this verse.
[2268.78 → 2271.78] So I'm going to say it to you so then you will know it.
[2271.78 → 2276.78] So this is Deuteronomy chapter 6, verse 4.
[2276.78 → 2277.78] It says,
[2277.78 → 2279.78] Hear, O Israel.
[2279.78 → 2280.78] Listen.
[2280.78 → 2281.78] Hear.
[2281.78 → 2282.78] Hear, O Israel.
[2282.78 → 2285.78] The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[2285.78 → 2286.78] Everyone put up a finger.
[2286.78 → 2287.78] One.
[2287.78 → 2289.78] The Lord is one.
[2289.78 → 2296.78] Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your strength.
[2296.78 → 2297.78] Okay?
[2297.78 → 2298.78] That's what it says.
[2298.78 → 2299.78] One God.
[2299.78 → 2300.78] One God.
[2300.78 → 2302.78] So now I'm going to teach you how to count.
[2302.78 → 2304.78] So I'm going to need five fingers.
[2304.78 → 2306.78] Can I have five fingers?
[2306.78 → 2307.78] Five fingers?
[2307.78 → 2308.78] Five fingers?
[2308.78 → 2309.78] You know how to count?
[2309.78 → 2310.78] Perfect.
[2310.78 → 2311.78] Okay, okay.
[2311.78 → 2312.78] You know how to count.
[2312.78 → 2313.78] That's not what I mean.
[2313.78 → 2323.78] So children back in the Bible's times would learn about their faith by counting on their fingers.
[2323.78 → 2325.78] So I'm going to teach you one through five today.
[2325.78 → 2326.78] Are you ready?
[2326.78 → 2327.78] Okay.
[2327.78 → 2328.78] Okay.
[2328.78 → 2329.78] You know the first one.
[2329.78 → 2330.78] One God.
[2330.78 → 2331.78] Okay?
[2331.78 → 2332.78] One God.
[2332.78 → 2333.78] How many gods are there?
[2333.78 → 2334.78] One.
[2334.78 → 2335.78] Hear, O Israel.
[2335.78 → 2337.78] The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[2337.78 → 2338.78] The Lord alone.
[2338.78 → 2339.78] Okay.
[2339.78 → 2340.78] Two.
[2340.78 → 2342.78] Two is two tablets.
[2342.78 → 2347.78] So when Moses went up on the mountain, and he came back with the law of God, there were two copies.
[2347.78 → 2349.78] One is God's copy.
[2349.78 → 2350.78] One is our copy.
[2350.78 → 2352.78] And they were put together in the tabernacle.
[2352.78 → 2354.78] But there were two tablets.
[2354.78 → 2355.78] So we say the two.
[2355.78 → 2357.78] Two tablets of the law.
[2357.78 → 2358.78] Everyone say that?
[2358.78 → 2359.78] Okay.
[2359.78 → 2360.78] Two tablets.
[2360.78 → 2361.78] Let me see your fingers.
[2361.78 → 2362.78] Two.
[2362.78 → 2363.78] Okay.
[2363.78 → 2367.78] Now three is three patriarchs.
[2367.78 → 2368.78] What's a patriarch?
[2368.78 → 2371.78] So they're kind of like the fathers of the faith.
[2371.78 → 2372.78] Our forefathers.
[2372.78 → 2374.78] Our ancestors of the faith.
[2374.78 → 2375.78] Do you know who they are?
[2375.78 → 2377.78] I'm going to tell you a lot of names today.
[2377.78 → 2378.78] Ready?
[2378.78 → 2381.78] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2381.78 → 2384.78] Have you heard those names from your Sunday school class?
[2384.78 → 2385.78] Okay.
[2385.78 → 2386.78] Everyone say it together.
[2386.78 → 2387.78] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2387.78 → 2388.78] Okay.
[2388.78 → 2389.78] Three what?
[2389.78 → 2390.78] Fathers.
[2390.78 → 2391.78] Okay.
[2391.78 → 2392.78] Three patriarchs.
[2392.78 → 2393.78] So let's review.
[2393.78 → 2394.78] Ready?
[2394.78 → 2396.78] One God.
[2396.78 → 2398.78] Two tablets.
[2398.78 → 2400.78] Three patriarchs.
[2400.78 → 2402.78] Number four.
[2402.78 → 2403.78] Matriarchs.
[2403.78 → 2404.78] Women.
[2404.78 → 2406.78] The mothers of the faith.
[2406.78 → 2408.78] So do you know who they are?
[2408.78 → 2409.78] Who's the first one?
[2409.78 → 2411.78] Abraham was married to?
[2411.78 → 2412.78] Sarah.

[2420.78 → 2424.78] And then Jacob had two wives.
[2424.78 → 2426.78] Talk to your parents about that.
[2426.78 → 2427.78] Yeah, I know.
[2427.78 → 2428.78] I know what.
[2428.78 → 2429.78] Okay.
[2429.78 → 2430.78] Rebecca.
[2430.78 → 2431.78] Then there was Leah and Rachel.
[2431.78 → 2432.78] Okay.
[2432.78 → 2433.78] So four patriarchs.
[2433.78 → 2436.78] Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah.
[2436.78 → 2437.78] Okay.
[2437.78 → 2440.78] Everyone say four matriarchs.
[2440.78 → 2441.78] Four matriarchs.
[2441.78 → 2442.78] Good.
[2442.78 → 2443.78] Let's review.
[2443.78 → 2444.78] Ready?
[2444.78 → 2445.78] One God.
[2445.78 → 2446.78] Two tablets.
[2446.78 → 2448.78] Three patriarchs.
[2448.78 → 2450.78] Four matriarchs.
[2450.78 → 2451.78] Five.
[2451.78 → 2452.78] What?
[2452.78 → 2453.78] Plages.
[2453.78 → 2454.78] Five plagues.
[2454.78 → 2455.78] No.
[2455.78 → 2456.78] Five books of Moses.
[2456.78 → 2458.78] So this is called the Torah.
[2458.78 → 2459.78] Everyone say Torah.
[2459.78 → 2460.78] Torah.
[2460.78 → 2461.78] What are the first five books of the Bible?
[2461.78 → 2462.78] The books of Moses.
[2462.78 → 2463.78] What's the first one?
[2463.78 → 2464.78] The first one?
[2464.78 → 2465.78] Genesis.

[2467.78 → 2468.78] Numbers.

[2469.78 → 2470.78] First five books in the Bible.
[2470.78 → 2471.78] Right?
[2471.78 → 2472.78] And so that's called the Torah.

[2480.78 → 2481.78] One.
[2481.78 → 2482.78] I only hear a couple of people.
[2482.78 → 2483.78] Oh, okay.
[2483.78 → 2484.78] Okay.
[2484.78 → 2485.78] So ready.
[2485.78 → 2486.78] Let's do the whole thing.
[2486.78 → 2487.78] You guys are learning a lot.

[2488.78 → 2489.78] One.
[2489.78 → 2490.78] One.
[2490.78 → 2492.78] I only hear a couple of people.
[2492.78 → 2493.78] Everyone.

[2505.78 → 2507.78] So you guys are learning a lot.
[2507.78 → 2508.78] That's good.
[2508.78 → 2509.78] All right.
[2509.78 → 2512.78] So now you can go learn more in your Sunday School class.
[2512.78 → 2513.78] So let me pray for us.
[2513.78 → 2518.78] Father, we thank you for the fact that you have given long-term gifts.
[2518.78 → 2523.78] Given long, long ago to our ancestors in the faith.
[2523.78 → 2526.78] We thank you that we are all children of Abraham.
[2526.78 → 2528.78] And that we believe in one God.
[2528.78 → 2530.78] You have given us your law.
[2530.78 → 2532.78] Lord, you have given us your word.
[2532.78 → 2533.78] We thank you.
[2533.78 → 2534.78] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2534.78 → 2535.78] Amen.
[2535.78 → 2536.78] All right.
[2536.78 → 2537.78] Thanks.
[2537.78 → 2538.78] Okay.
[2538.78 → 2539.78] Go quiz your parents later.
[2539.78 → 2540.78] After church.
[2540.78 → 2541.78] Come on.
[2541.78 → 2542.78] Look at that.
[2542.78 → 2543.78] Careful.
[2543.78 → 2544.78] Careful.
[2544.78 → 2545.78] You're welcome.
[2545.78 → 2546.78] You're welcome.
[2546.78 → 2547.78] You're welcome.
[2547.78 → 2548.78] I'm going to read your name.
[2548.78 → 2549.78] You're welcome.
[2549.78 → 2550.78] Watch is in progress.
[2550.78 → 2551.78] Hey.
[2551.78 → 2552.78] Okay.
[2552.78 → 2553.78] So we can teach those carbon notes when you're old.
[2553.78 → 2554.78] You know.
[2554.78 → 2555.78] Okay.
[2555.78 → 2556.78] Okay.
[2556.78 → 2557.78] You know, we can set yourself up.
[2557.78 → 2558.78] Go.
[2558.86 → 2559.78] The Bible is really low on deck.
[2559.78 → 2560.78] Yes.
[2560.78 → 2561.78] You're welcome.
[2561.78 → 2562.78] Good to our god.
[2562.78 → 2563.78] You're welcome.
[2563.78 → 2564.78] Ready?
[2564.78 → 2565.78] inspired?
[2565.78 → 2566.78] What are your expectations?
[2566.78 → 2567.78] That's right.
[2567.78 → 2568.78] Can we stay like.
[2568.78 → 2569.78] Understood.
[2569.78 → 2570.78] You're welcome.
[2570.78 → 2571.78] Doing things.
[2571.78 → 2572.78] stealing, losing weight, sorry, life.
[2572.78 → 2593.34] All right, good morning.
[2594.56 → 2599.10] So we are in a summer sermon series just in the book of the Psalms.
[2599.10 → 2602.78] Each Sunday, taking a different psalm, studying it together.
[2603.70 → 2606.36] And our text this morning is Psalm 32.
[2607.06 → 2609.92] If you want, you can turn there in your Bibles with me.
[2610.64 → 2612.02] Psalm 32.
[2615.42 → 2619.20] That is on page 413 in your pew Bible.
[2620.54 → 2626.22] So now Psalm 32 is one of seven penitential psalms.
[2626.22 → 2630.34] So, and of course, so-called because they are about repentance.
[2630.58 → 2632.06] They are about confession of sin.
[2632.40 → 2639.82] So for you kids who are still here, what this means is that this is about saying, I'm sorry to God.
[2640.42 → 2641.58] It's about saying, I'm sorry.
[2642.58 → 2646.02] So let's read Psalm 32 this morning.
[2646.02 → 2650.16] Of David, a Gaskill.
[2650.16 → 2657.22] Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[2658.14 → 2664.26] Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him, in whose spirit is no deceit.
[2664.92 → 2667.36] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away.
[2668.02 → 2673.28] Through my groaning all day long, for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[2673.90 → 2676.30] My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
[2676.30 → 2679.10] Then I acknowledged my sin to you.
[2679.70 → 2681.60] I did not cover up my iniquity.
[2681.74 → 2684.40] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.
[2685.16 → 2687.64] And you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[2688.80 → 2692.58] Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found.
[2693.48 → 2696.40] Surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.
[2697.14 → 2698.52] You are my hiding place.
[2699.02 → 2703.74] You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.
[2703.74 → 2707.12] I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go.
[2707.62 → 2709.38] I will counsel you and watch over you.
[2710.08 → 2713.06] Do not be like the horse or mule which have no understanding,
[2713.38 → 2717.06] but must be controlled by bit and bridle, or they will not come to you.
[2718.00 → 2719.32] Many are the woes of the wicked,
[2719.88 → 2723.76] but the Lord's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.
[2724.70 → 2727.16] Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous.
[2727.92 → 2731.28] Sing, all you who are upright in heart.
[2731.28 → 2733.28] This is the word of the Lord.
[2735.80 → 2737.36] All right, let's pray together.
[2739.82 → 2743.42] Oh, Father in heaven, we thank you that your word is true.
[2744.20 → 2749.12] We thank you that your spirit hovers over your word, making it clear to us.
[2749.96 → 2755.52] And we ask that you would give us this morning eyes to see the goodness of confession,
[2755.52 → 2759.82] the beauty, and the glory that you call us to.
[2760.60 → 2766.44] And help us most of all, Lord, to see Jesus, the one who forgives us, our Redeemer.
[2767.00 → 2768.08] We pray in his name.
[2768.58 → 2768.86] Amen.
[2768.86 → 2768.94] Amen.
[2771.14 → 2776.22] So John Arlberg is an author, he's a pastor, and he tells this story.
[2777.78 → 2782.20] So he says, some years ago, early on in our marriage,
[2782.82 → 2790.88] my wife and I sold our Volkswagen Beetle to buy our first really nice piece of furniture.
[2790.88 → 2794.06] It was a sofa.
[2795.06 → 2799.84] It was a pink sofa, but for that kind of money, it was called a mob sofa.
[2800.98 → 2806.94] Now the man at the furniture store warned us not to get it when he found out that we had small children.
[2807.72 → 2810.92] You don't want a mob sofa, get something the colour of dirt.
[2812.60 → 2815.02] We know how to handle our children.
[2815.36 → 2816.26] Give us the mob sofa.
[2816.26 → 2822.28] From that moment on, we knew clearly the number one rule in the house.
[2823.10 → 2825.14] Don't sit on the mob sofa.
[2825.98 → 2827.60] Don't touch the mob sofa.
[2827.86 → 2829.48] Don't play around the mob sofa.
[2829.76 → 2833.36] Don't eat on, breathe on, look at, or think about the mob sofa.
[2834.52 → 2837.00] Remember the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden?
[2837.72 → 2841.24] On every other chair in the house, you may freely sit.
[2841.24 → 2845.48] But upon the sofa, the mob sofa, you may not sit.
[2846.06 → 2849.18] For in the day you sit thereupon, you shall surely die.
[2849.18 → 2853.28] Then came the fall.
[2854.32 → 2858.46] One day there appeared on the mob sofa a stain.
[2859.42 → 2860.74] A red stain.
[2861.70 → 2863.18] A red jelly stain.
[2864.64 → 2871.32] So my wife, who had chosen the mob sofa and adored it, lined up our three children in front of it.
[2871.32 → 2872.64] Laura, age four.
[2873.26 → 2874.58] Mallory, two and a half.
[2875.22 → 2876.60] And Johnny, six months.
[2878.10 → 2879.78] Do you see that, children?
[2880.00 → 2881.14] That red stain?
[2881.28 → 2882.50] That red jelly stain?
[2883.04 → 2885.82] The man at the furniture store says it's not coming out.
[2885.94 → 2886.50] Not forever.
[2887.48 → 2889.46] Do you know how long forever is?
[2890.10 → 2893.42] That's how long you're going to stand here until one of you fesses up.
[2895.12 → 2897.82] Mallory, the middle child, was the first to break.
[2897.82 → 2902.24] With trembling lips and tear-filled eyes, she said, Laura did it.
[2903.74 → 2905.74] Laura passionately denied it.
[2906.80 → 2909.06] Then there was silence for the longest time.
[2909.14 → 2910.12] No one said a word.
[2911.10 → 2913.42] I knew, so this is John Oberg speaking,
[2913.54 → 2915.18] I knew the children wouldn't confess.
[2915.48 → 2916.96] They had never seen their mom so mad.
[2917.92 → 2919.82] I knew they wouldn't confess.
[2920.44 → 2924.00] They knew if they did, they'd spend eternity in time out.
[2924.00 → 2932.20] And I knew they wouldn't confess because I was the one who put the red jelly stain on the mob sofa.
[2932.96 → 2934.98] And I knew I wasn't saying anything.
[2936.48 → 2941.58] And then he says, the truth is we have all stained the mob sofa.
[2941.58 → 2949.62] And so this morning we have no less a picture of guilt than Psalm 32.
[2950.76 → 2956.42] Psalm 32 is about guilt and the destruction that it causes in our lives.
[2957.56 → 2960.26] But Psalm 32 also, it gives us the remedy.
[2960.94 → 2964.16] It's a remedy that leads to joy.
[2965.16 → 2967.08] So let's jump into Psalm 32 together.
[2967.44 → 2970.00] And we're going to look at this psalm today in three movements.
[2970.00 → 2973.84] And the first movement is the groaning of guilt.
[2974.52 → 2975.72] Okay, the groaning of guilt.
[2975.82 → 2980.98] So let's have a look at verse 3 in our passage.
[2982.18 → 2989.44] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[2990.82 → 2995.64] David says, when I kept silent.
[2995.64 → 3001.82] I think we have all experienced what David is talking about here.
[3001.88 → 3002.82] We know it intuitively.
[3004.16 → 3010.14] It's when we draw a line in our life that God cannot cross.
[3011.28 → 3011.52] Right?
[3011.58 → 3014.00] We say, this far and no farther.
[3014.80 → 3019.14] We shut a door in our life that God is not allowed to open.
[3019.14 → 3020.14] Right?
[3021.20 → 3026.20] And so there's some area of sin that we dare not face.
[3026.52 → 3030.64] Something that we have said or done maybe even a long time ago.
[3030.88 → 3032.84] And we've not asked for forgiveness.
[3034.16 → 3040.72] And so whatever it is, when we harbour unconfessed, unacknowledged sin.
[3040.72 → 3048.36] When we close this door to God, the result is this spiritual wasting away.
[3049.48 → 3055.44] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[3057.26 → 3059.48] You know, Marian shared this, there you are.
[3060.36 → 3063.28] Her story about when she was a kid.
[3063.46 → 3065.76] Well, I was thinking of a story I have.
[3065.76 → 3069.06] I remember a lie I told my parents.
[3069.76 → 3072.22] You know, I'm sure it wasn't the first lie I ever told.
[3072.42 → 3074.04] Or the only lie I ever told.
[3074.40 → 3075.82] But it was a memorable one.
[3076.58 → 3081.52] Because, you know, I flat out manipulated the truth to get out of trouble.
[3082.50 → 3085.10] And I remember the feeling of guilt.
[3085.76 → 3088.08] I remember the struggling in my conscience.
[3088.92 → 3090.94] And, you know, I remember this groaning of guilt.
[3091.98 → 3094.12] And you know the groaning of guilt, right?
[3094.12 → 3097.56] You've experienced this, where your conscience won't let you sleep.
[3097.66 → 3099.50] You stay up at night thinking about it.
[3099.98 → 3101.50] You might lose your appetite.
[3101.74 → 3103.20] You just don't really, nothing tastes good.
[3103.24 → 3103.96] You don't want to eat.
[3104.86 → 3108.52] And there's this obsessive thinking where you kind of just get on this hamster wheel.
[3108.74 → 3111.22] And you just start running, right?
[3111.22 → 3114.82] And on that hamster wheel, there might be rationalizations.
[3115.44 → 3118.10] Like, was what I did that bad, really?
[3119.08 → 3120.60] You know what about what they did?
[3121.00 → 3122.52] So you're thinking about this kind of things.
[3122.52 → 3125.90] Or maybe you're just running through that script of condemnation.
[3125.90 → 3128.12] Like, oh, I can't believe I did that.
[3128.16 → 3129.28] I am such a fool.
[3130.80 → 3133.78] Or maybe the obsessive thinking is about fear.
[3134.22 → 3135.78] Like, who's going to find out?
[3136.58 → 3138.14] Who's going to find out what I did?
[3139.36 → 3142.44] This is all the groaning of guilt, right?
[3142.46 → 3144.86] And it's spiritually exhausting.
[3144.86 → 3151.94] But there are also often physical symptoms as well.
[3152.06 → 3154.08] David says, my bones wasted away.
[3155.06 → 3158.10] You know, we tell ourselves, of course, that those two things aren't related, right?
[3158.14 → 3161.40] The spiritual and the physical, they're not related.
[3162.14 → 3163.16] But they are.
[3163.82 → 3171.66] The Bible speaks of our humanity as this fundamental union of body and soul that almost really can't even be separated.
[3171.66 → 3183.04] And so it makes sense that things that affect our souls, like anxiety or trauma or guilt, they also affect our bodies.
[3183.82 → 3183.94] Right?
[3183.98 → 3188.98] When we're anxious, we, you know, our hearts beat faster.
[3189.32 → 3191.24] We might feel sick to our stomachs.
[3191.24 → 3196.34] When we're tired and when we're stressed out, our bodies get weaker.
[3196.48 → 3197.36] We might get sick.
[3198.58 → 3204.26] And so, and when we have unconfessed sin, in the same way, we feel it in our bodies.
[3204.36 → 3206.22] It affects the whole person.
[3207.70 → 3214.78] But though we try to remain silent, right, we want to keep the guilt in, God knows us.
[3215.40 → 3216.68] He knows us intimately.
[3216.68 → 3218.84] He knows the sins that we try to hide.
[3219.18 → 3220.62] And he wants to heal us.
[3221.24 → 3228.22] And so it's not surprising that God himself is then actually trying to kind of push David's guilt into him.
[3228.28 → 3232.72] He's trying to highlight the sense of guilt that David has.
[3233.44 → 3233.66] Right?
[3233.76 → 3234.62] Look at verse 4.
[3236.44 → 3240.28] For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
[3240.80 → 3242.94] My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
[3242.94 → 3243.10] Right?
[3243.10 → 3243.36] Right?
[3244.36 → 3249.58] He says, the heavy hand of God was on me.
[3249.74 → 3251.44] God, you know, the guilt.
[3253.08 → 3254.76] God wasn't lessening his guilt.
[3254.86 → 3257.38] He was actually laying it on heavy on him.
[3258.48 → 3260.50] And, you know, I think it's such a vivid image.
[3261.48 → 3263.98] And then the result is this loss of vitality.
[3263.98 → 3266.58] We feel spiritually weary.
[3267.64 → 3269.84] You know, it's like the grass in my front yard.
[3269.96 → 3273.22] In the heat of the summer, it just turns brown.
[3273.58 → 3274.72] The city likes to call it golden.
[3274.98 → 3276.28] No, it's dead.
[3276.50 → 3277.46] It looks so dead.
[3278.94 → 3281.60] And, you know, when we think about confession,
[3281.60 → 3285.42] you know, I think so often we talk about confession
[3285.42 → 3287.40] or we do confession on Sunday morning.
[3287.90 → 3289.04] You know, sometimes we could be like,
[3289.24 → 3291.32] we have these negative feelings about it.
[3291.40 → 3293.08] We're like, oh, a life of confession.
[3293.84 → 3294.08] Right?
[3294.16 → 3295.50] That sounds so exhausting.
[3295.62 → 3296.68] How can I keep that up?
[3296.70 → 3298.30] We got to talk about our sin all the time.
[3299.00 → 3301.04] But the Bible says exactly the opposite.
[3302.04 → 3302.26] Right?
[3302.28 → 3304.98] That there's nothing in this world so exhausting,
[3305.32 → 3308.76] so life depleting as resisting God.
[3309.46 → 3309.64] Right?
[3309.64 → 3312.14] And keeping sin in our souls.
[3313.24 → 3315.92] God does not want us to cover up our sin
[3315.92 → 3319.34] by, you know, and keeping him at arm's length.
[3319.48 → 3322.66] So he puts his heavy hand on us.
[3324.02 → 3325.70] And what David's talking about here,
[3326.06 → 3328.14] the technical Christian word for this,
[3328.74 → 3329.46] is conviction.
[3330.40 → 3330.96] Conviction.
[3331.62 → 3331.84] Right?
[3331.84 → 3334.28] It is actually God's mercy.
[3335.30 → 3338.60] This conviction, his hand upon us,
[3338.60 → 3340.70] is the mercy of God.
[3341.58 → 3343.12] When we feel convicted,
[3343.44 → 3344.76] when we feel our guilt,
[3345.24 → 3348.70] that is God inviting us to be free of it.
[3349.58 → 3349.80] Right?
[3349.88 → 3351.38] I kind of imagine his coming,
[3351.48 → 3353.30] he's putting his arms around us,
[3353.50 → 3354.38] and he's saying,
[3355.04 → 3357.08] don't you want to confess that sin?
[3357.62 → 3357.74] Right?
[3357.80 → 3359.32] Don't you want to let go of it
[3359.32 → 3360.52] and be free from it?
[3360.52 → 3365.68] Friends, if the Lord's heavy hand is on you today,
[3366.00 → 3368.62] it's because he loves you.
[3369.22 → 3371.50] His heart yearns for you.
[3372.20 → 3374.92] He yearns for you to be reconciled to him,
[3374.94 → 3376.20] to be free of sin,
[3376.98 → 3379.22] to be revitalized,
[3379.30 → 3382.22] to cast off this exhaustion of our sin.
[3382.22 → 3384.60] And you know,
[3384.72 → 3386.30] because he loves us,
[3386.60 → 3390.66] he is not going to let us hold on to sin.
[3391.50 → 3391.88] Right?
[3391.96 → 3394.58] He ransomed our souls from hell
[3394.58 → 3398.04] by laying the crushing weight of our sin
[3398.04 → 3399.48] on his only son.
[3400.46 → 3400.66] Right?
[3400.70 → 3401.34] The Bible says,
[3401.50 → 3403.76] the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[3404.66 → 3405.76] And so that means,
[3406.26 → 3409.80] not even your sin belongs to you.
[3410.00 → 3411.12] It's not yours.
[3411.12 → 3413.16] God laid it on Jesus.
[3414.46 → 3414.90] And so then,
[3415.30 → 3417.08] why hold on to it?
[3417.18 → 3421.04] Why kind of stand between Jesus and your sin
[3421.04 → 3421.66] and say,
[3422.02 → 3422.92] you can't have it?
[3424.00 → 3424.24] Right?
[3424.30 → 3425.90] He died to take it away from you.
[3426.76 → 3428.10] Why not give it to him today?
[3428.48 → 3429.84] Why not confess it?
[3431.18 → 3431.50] You know,
[3431.58 → 3433.10] it's like garbage day.
[3433.48 → 3433.72] You know,
[3433.78 → 3435.02] we have garbage day every week.
[3435.10 → 3436.26] The garbage truck comes around,
[3436.52 → 3437.64] it collects all the garbage,
[3438.28 → 3440.58] but instead of putting it out on the curb
[3440.58 → 3441.54] to be taken away,
[3441.70 → 3442.82] you bring it inside
[3442.82 → 3444.14] and put it in your bedroom
[3444.14 → 3445.48] and pile it there.
[3448.56 → 3450.44] When we feel convicted
[3450.44 → 3452.24] of a particular sin,
[3452.74 → 3455.24] that is actually the mercy of God.
[3456.24 → 3459.46] That is God doing something in your life.
[3459.46 → 3463.96] If you want to experience God working in your life,
[3464.38 → 3468.24] feel the heaviness of his hand upon you
[3468.24 → 3469.88] and confess to him
[3469.88 → 3473.60] that you will experience God working in your life in that way.
[3473.68 → 3475.42] And it's the most loving thing he can do.
[3476.58 → 3478.14] And it's an invitation to confession,
[3478.24 → 3479.36] to be open to God,
[3479.52 → 3480.56] to draw near to him.
[3481.42 → 3483.08] In Psalm 139,
[3483.52 → 3485.14] David prays this to God.
[3485.14 → 3485.54] He says,
[3485.92 → 3486.40] search me, God.
[3486.68 → 3487.60] Know my heart.
[3487.92 → 3488.44] Test me.
[3488.92 → 3490.26] Know my anxious thoughts.
[3491.00 → 3493.02] See if there is any offensive way in me
[3493.02 → 3495.20] and lead me in the way of everlasting.
[3496.64 → 3497.56] In other words,
[3497.60 → 3497.90] he's saying,
[3498.00 → 3498.30] God,
[3498.40 → 3500.74] show me what is going on here.
[3500.96 → 3502.56] When I'm feeling spiritually weary,
[3502.68 → 3504.20] when I'm feeling distant from you,
[3504.90 → 3507.06] show me what's going on.
[3508.48 → 3510.38] Show me the doors that I've closed.
[3510.58 → 3512.48] Show me those lines that I have drawn,
[3512.48 → 3515.20] the sin that I am harbouring in my heart.
[3516.56 → 3517.88] And the only question is then,
[3517.96 → 3520.40] are you ready to open up to God
[3520.40 → 3523.60] and receive the life that he wants to give you?
[3523.94 → 3525.12] He wants to give you life.
[3526.62 → 3528.94] And so that leads us to the second point this morning,
[3529.08 → 3531.84] the uncovering of confession.
[3532.30 → 3533.36] Uncovering of confession.
[3533.36 → 3536.30] So the Russian novel,
[3536.44 → 3537.44] Crime and Punishment,
[3537.62 → 3540.82] centres on this man named Raskolnikov.
[3542.08 → 3542.52] Raskolnikov.
[3543.22 → 3543.94] Something like that.
[3544.78 → 3545.90] And so this guy,
[3546.32 → 3548.36] he has committed a double murder.
[3549.64 → 3553.94] And he thought he would be able to commit the crime
[3553.94 → 3556.36] and withstand the guilt of it.
[3556.36 → 3559.36] But as the rest of the novel unfolds,
[3560.08 → 3563.48] he is actually destroyed by the guilt that he feels.
[3563.64 → 3565.86] He is destroyed by this groaning of guilt.
[3566.94 → 3568.46] And finally, he admits it.
[3568.54 → 3570.40] He admits what he's done to Sonia,
[3570.52 → 3571.48] a young Christian woman.
[3571.92 → 3575.28] He admits the terrible secret of his murder.
[3576.26 → 3580.72] And Sonia tells him his only hope is confession.
[3582.24 → 3583.40] Confession to God.
[3584.20 → 3585.42] Confession to the police.
[3585.42 → 3586.88] Confession to a priest.
[3587.28 → 3587.96] To everyone.
[3589.18 → 3591.26] Stand up, she says to him.
[3591.58 → 3593.16] She seized him by the shoulder.
[3593.58 → 3596.52] And he rose, looking at her, almost in amazement.
[3597.42 → 3598.90] Go now this minute.
[3599.60 → 3600.94] Stand in the crossroads.
[3601.42 → 3604.64] Bow down and first kiss the earth that you have defiled.
[3605.08 → 3608.12] Then bow to the whole world on all four sides.
[3608.58 → 3610.10] And say aloud to everyone,
[3610.32 → 3611.44] I have killed.
[3612.60 → 3614.78] And then God will send you life again.
[3615.42 → 3617.02] Will you go?
[3617.02 → 3623.06] David, in the psalm, the author of Psalm 32,
[3623.28 → 3624.38] he was in the same place.
[3625.16 → 3625.30] Right?
[3625.38 → 3628.94] In verses three and four, he's refusing to confess.
[3629.16 → 3631.70] He is in agony, though, because of his sin.
[3632.00 → 3635.74] But finally, in verse five, he uncovers his sin.
[3635.74 → 3638.10] Verse five says,
[3638.16 → 3639.98] Then I acknowledged my sin to you.
[3640.20 → 3641.76] I did not cover up my iniquity.
[3641.76 → 3644.98] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.
[3645.48 → 3648.32] And you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[3648.32 → 3650.42] Right?
[3650.42 → 3652.42] As long as we cover our sin,
[3652.62 → 3656.74] God will just keep his heavy hand upon us,
[3656.82 → 3658.22] exposing it to us,
[3658.90 → 3660.50] bringing us to conviction.
[3661.50 → 3665.48] But as soon as we uncover our sin,
[3666.32 → 3667.34] God covers it up.
[3668.50 → 3669.10] Isn't that cool?
[3669.54 → 3670.92] We're holding it in.
[3670.98 → 3671.68] We're holding it in.
[3672.06 → 3674.20] Finally, God convicts us.
[3674.26 → 3675.12] We uncover it.
[3675.18 → 3678.22] And immediately, God covers it himself.
[3678.78 → 3679.64] And he removes it.
[3679.70 → 3682.12] As far as the east is from the west,
[3682.16 → 3683.14] he forgives us.
[3684.16 → 3686.40] And like, notice how quick it is.
[3686.50 → 3686.58] Right?
[3686.64 → 3687.96] God is so quick to forgive.
[3688.84 → 3690.58] David, if you think about his life
[3690.58 → 3693.74] and, you know, his sin against Bathsheba and Uriah,
[3693.86 → 3695.30] and it took him like a year
[3695.30 → 3697.58] to really confess his sin,
[3697.58 → 3699.42] the prophet Nathan comes to him and says,
[3699.58 → 3700.26] you are the man.
[3700.98 → 3701.96] He's convicted.
[3702.22 → 3703.32] He turns to God.
[3704.60 → 3706.16] He uncovers his sin.
[3706.72 → 3708.34] And what does God say to him?
[3708.38 → 3708.92] Does he say,
[3709.56 → 3711.22] well, okay, you've confessed,
[3711.48 → 3712.60] but I've got to think about this.
[3712.66 → 3713.24] You know, I don't know
[3713.24 → 3714.36] if I'm going to forgive you or not.
[3715.30 → 3716.70] That's not what God says.
[3717.08 → 3719.54] You forgave the guilt of my sin.
[3720.56 → 3721.48] Just like that.
[3722.60 → 3722.74] Right?
[3722.80 → 3723.82] God is so eager
[3723.82 → 3727.36] to stand with us against our sin.
[3728.30 → 3730.64] He's so eager to take our side,
[3730.96 → 3732.38] to heal us.
[3734.24 → 3736.26] And notice how personal
[3736.26 → 3740.36] this relationship of confession and forgiveness is.
[3741.26 → 3743.56] Because who is David confessing to?
[3744.62 → 3747.40] Who is David uncovering his sin to?
[3748.68 → 3749.66] It's to the Lord.
[3751.00 → 3752.76] And so guilt, the guilt that we feel,
[3752.76 → 3754.68] it's not primarily psychological.
[3755.28 → 3756.76] It's not primarily social.
[3756.76 → 3758.24] Us with other people.
[3758.66 → 3761.20] Our guilt is ultimately in reference to God.
[3762.70 → 3764.64] Psalm, you know, the Psalm 32,
[3764.76 → 3765.94] it begins in verse 1.
[3766.94 → 3767.66] Where it says,
[3768.30 → 3769.82] blessed is the one
[3769.82 → 3772.04] whose transgressions are forgiven,
[3772.82 → 3774.28] whose sins are covered.
[3775.10 → 3775.34] Right?
[3775.40 → 3776.70] Not blessed is the group.
[3777.74 → 3779.04] Blessed is the one.
[3779.84 → 3781.44] Because this is about you
[3781.44 → 3782.64] and God.
[3782.64 → 3783.54] Your relationship.
[3784.84 → 3787.24] And David uses two different Hebrew words
[3787.24 → 3788.42] that are closely connected,
[3789.18 → 3790.66] but distinct,
[3790.82 → 3791.98] that talk about the nature
[3791.98 → 3793.54] of our relationship with God
[3793.54 → 3795.14] in sin
[3795.14 → 3796.52] when we confess to him.
[3796.58 → 3797.98] And the first word that you see there
[3797.98 → 3798.84] is this word,
[3798.94 → 3799.58] transgression.
[3800.78 → 3802.32] The Bible says that sin
[3802.32 → 3804.22] is transgression
[3804.22 → 3806.84] against God's holy laws,
[3806.88 → 3808.04] which are meant for our joy.
[3808.04 → 3810.22] So it's when you do something
[3810.22 → 3811.52] that you were explicitly told
[3811.52 → 3813.52] not to do.
[3813.64 → 3815.22] You break a specific law
[3815.22 → 3816.84] that is a transgression.
[3817.90 → 3818.80] So think of it as like
[3818.80 → 3821.06] a high-handed rebellion against God.
[3821.66 → 3822.94] Or think about like a two-year-old
[3822.94 → 3824.08] when he's like,
[3824.42 → 3824.86] do this.
[3824.92 → 3825.26] They say,
[3825.52 → 3825.78] no.
[3827.02 → 3827.90] That's what we do.
[3828.20 → 3828.72] Transgression.
[3828.72 → 3831.90] And since transgressions
[3831.90 → 3833.92] are sins against God's law,
[3834.04 → 3834.56] that means
[3834.56 → 3836.52] our intuitions
[3836.52 → 3838.24] are not a guide
[3838.24 → 3839.24] to what is
[3839.24 → 3840.06] and is not
[3840.06 → 3840.72] sinful.
[3841.80 → 3842.20] Sin
[3842.20 → 3843.56] is sin
[3843.56 → 3844.38] in relation
[3844.38 → 3845.56] to who God is,
[3846.02 → 3846.74] not in relation
[3846.74 → 3847.78] to who we want
[3847.78 → 3848.46] God to be.
[3849.44 → 3850.10] And that's why
[3850.10 → 3850.76] our feelings
[3850.76 → 3851.84] are not the authority
[3851.84 → 3852.74] on what is
[3852.74 → 3853.52] and is not sinful.
[3853.90 → 3854.10] Right?
[3854.12 → 3855.08] It's not up to us
[3855.08 → 3856.10] to decide
[3856.10 → 3857.66] what God's law
[3857.66 → 3858.36] is
[3858.36 → 3859.60] and what it
[3859.60 → 3860.50] is not.
[3860.66 → 3861.44] God gives us
[3861.44 → 3861.86] his law
[3861.86 → 3863.08] and we transgress it.
[3863.98 → 3864.68] So when I,
[3864.90 → 3865.20] essentially,
[3865.34 → 3866.08] when I confess
[3866.08 → 3867.46] my transgressions
[3867.46 → 3867.82] to God,
[3867.90 → 3868.48] I'm saying,
[3869.22 → 3869.82] okay God,
[3869.90 → 3870.88] I agree with you.
[3871.44 → 3872.98] I agree that this law
[3872.98 → 3873.68] is yours.
[3873.82 → 3874.42] It is good.
[3874.52 → 3875.56] It is for my benefit
[3875.56 → 3876.18] and flourishing.
[3876.56 → 3878.54] I agree that I broke it.
[3878.66 → 3879.70] I transgressed.
[3880.16 → 3881.82] And I tell my feelings
[3881.82 → 3883.14] to get in line
[3883.14 → 3884.64] with the word of God.
[3886.00 → 3886.86] And when I'm tempted
[3886.86 → 3888.28] to redefine
[3888.28 → 3889.26] the parameters
[3889.26 → 3889.96] of sin,
[3890.08 → 3891.34] maybe to dismiss it,
[3891.58 → 3892.04] just get rid
[3892.04 → 3892.82] of my guilt
[3892.82 → 3893.86] in my own way,
[3893.86 → 3896.38] I tell my feelings
[3896.38 → 3898.10] to fall in line
[3898.10 → 3898.98] with the word of God.
[3900.40 → 3901.06] Now,
[3901.20 → 3902.24] the second word
[3902.24 → 3904.36] here is sins.
[3905.54 → 3906.70] David needs
[3906.70 → 3907.76] to have his sins
[3907.76 → 3908.98] covered over
[3908.98 → 3910.10] to be forgiven,
[3911.08 → 3912.00] put out of sight.
[3912.84 → 3913.92] And the Hebrew term
[3913.92 → 3915.52] for sin,
[3915.72 → 3916.86] it literally means
[3916.86 → 3917.96] missing the mark.
[3918.94 → 3919.18] You know,
[3919.30 → 3920.26] Romans 3 says,
[3920.38 → 3921.90] we have all sinned
[3921.90 → 3922.90] and fallen short
[3922.90 → 3924.42] of the glory of God.
[3925.26 → 3926.06] It's like,
[3926.10 → 3927.34] it's like getting
[3927.34 → 3928.26] a bad grade
[3928.26 → 3928.98] in school
[3928.98 → 3930.68] that absolutely
[3930.68 → 3932.20] disqualifies us
[3932.20 → 3932.90] before God,
[3933.42 → 3933.90] where we should
[3933.90 → 3934.54] be expelled.
[3936.30 → 3937.58] We fall short
[3937.58 → 3939.16] of our created mandate
[3939.16 → 3940.16] as image bearers
[3940.16 → 3940.60] of God,
[3940.70 → 3941.80] to know God,
[3941.86 → 3942.92] to delight in him,
[3943.12 → 3944.54] to represent him.
[3945.18 → 3945.96] And David says,
[3946.02 → 3946.58] this is part of
[3946.58 → 3947.28] what sin is.
[3947.34 → 3947.84] It's a failure
[3947.84 → 3948.74] to live up
[3948.74 → 3950.32] to God's commandments
[3950.32 → 3951.42] in his ways.
[3952.76 → 3952.96] And so,
[3953.04 → 3953.76] these two words,
[3953.86 → 3954.80] we have transgressions,
[3954.90 → 3955.66] we have sins,
[3955.82 → 3957.06] and they are both
[3957.06 → 3958.24] defined as being
[3958.24 → 3958.98] against God.
[3959.98 → 3961.00] And that is why,
[3961.16 → 3961.54] David,
[3962.88 → 3963.96] when he's forgiven,
[3964.82 → 3965.82] he says,
[3966.52 → 3967.00] blessed.
[3967.64 → 3968.84] That's the first word
[3968.84 → 3969.60] in Psalm 32.
[3969.60 → 3970.16] Blessed,
[3970.52 → 3971.24] it means happy.
[3972.12 → 3973.16] Happy is the one
[3973.16 → 3974.04] whose transgressions
[3974.04 → 3974.64] are forgiven,
[3975.12 → 3976.02] whose sins are covered.
[3976.98 → 3978.14] God forgives
[3978.14 → 3979.26] the guilt
[3979.26 → 3980.64] of my transgressions
[3980.64 → 3981.36] against his law.
[3981.44 → 3982.06] He forgives
[3982.06 → 3982.70] the guilt
[3982.70 → 3983.84] of my sin
[3983.84 → 3985.36] of not living up
[3985.36 → 3985.90] to who God
[3985.90 → 3986.76] has made me to be.
[3987.34 → 3988.28] He's forgiven it.
[3988.58 → 3989.42] We're restored
[3989.42 → 3990.78] to fellowship with God.
[3991.42 → 3992.74] And the joy overflows.
[3993.28 → 3994.26] All the pressure
[3994.26 → 3994.80] is taken off.
[3994.86 → 3995.62] All that guilt
[3995.62 → 3996.44] that we harbour,
[3997.06 → 3998.26] we are set free from.
[3998.26 → 4000.00] We can be at freedom
[4000.00 → 4000.82] in our relationship
[4000.82 → 4001.34] with God.
[4002.48 → 4002.82] And so you know
[4002.82 → 4003.30] what that means?
[4003.38 → 4004.46] The question is not,
[4005.18 → 4008.40] how do we convince God
[4008.40 → 4010.40] to make us happy?
[4010.56 → 4011.48] That's not the question
[4011.48 → 4012.70] of the Christian life.
[4013.04 → 4014.58] God doesn't need convincing
[4014.58 → 4015.46] to make us happy.
[4016.20 → 4017.52] God is all about
[4017.52 → 4018.54] our happiness.
[4018.80 → 4020.04] He wants us to rejoice.
[4020.60 → 4021.68] He wants us to be blessed.
[4022.66 → 4024.96] And the way that is to happen
[4024.96 → 4027.14] is when we experience
[4027.14 → 4028.56] his forgiveness
[4028.56 → 4030.72] by uncovering our sins.
[4031.76 → 4032.74] And when we do that,
[4032.80 → 4033.58] we uncover our sins,
[4033.66 → 4034.68] we draw near to God.
[4035.30 → 4036.50] He doesn't just forgive us
[4036.50 → 4037.14] our sins,
[4037.94 → 4039.14] but something new
[4039.14 → 4041.52] enters into our experience.
[4042.38 → 4043.36] And we are filled,
[4043.50 → 4044.88] like as it says later on,
[4045.02 → 4046.64] with shouts of deliverance,
[4046.98 → 4047.88] with this joy
[4047.88 → 4048.72] that's overflowing.
[4049.72 → 4050.72] And that brings us
[4050.72 → 4052.30] to our third movement here,
[4052.88 → 4054.76] the fruit of forgiveness.
[4054.76 → 4056.04] Right?
[4056.10 → 4057.00] We've looked at the groaning
[4057.00 → 4057.54] of sin,
[4057.74 → 4058.46] groaning of guilt,
[4059.18 → 4060.60] the uncovering of our sin,
[4060.72 → 4061.36] and then now,
[4062.30 → 4063.62] after God forgives us,
[4063.70 → 4064.48] what is the fruit
[4064.48 → 4065.18] of that forgiveness?
[4067.02 → 4068.04] And so here,
[4068.38 → 4069.58] confession has occurred,
[4069.72 → 4070.88] conviction, confession,
[4071.38 → 4072.82] and now we're given
[4072.82 → 4073.42] this picture
[4073.42 → 4074.34] of what it looks like
[4074.34 → 4075.98] now to just trust God
[4075.98 → 4077.64] from a willing heart.
[4078.14 → 4078.86] To trust him now
[4078.86 → 4079.76] from a willing heart.
[4080.06 → 4080.70] And we see this
[4080.70 → 4081.80] in verses 8 to 11
[4081.80 → 4082.36] in our passage.
[4082.96 → 4083.64] So let's just look
[4083.64 → 4084.40] at each of these quickly.
[4084.88 → 4087.18] Verse 8 says this,
[4087.62 → 4088.30] God speaking,
[4088.54 → 4089.92] I will instruct you
[4089.92 → 4091.20] and teach you
[4091.20 → 4092.20] in the way you should go.
[4092.46 → 4093.46] I will counsel you
[4093.46 → 4096.00] with my loving eye on you.
[4099.92 → 4100.76] Do you,
[4101.64 → 4103.72] what does it look like
[4103.72 → 4105.68] to know that you have
[4105.68 → 4108.28] truly confessed your sin?
[4108.34 → 4109.88] When you've truly repented.
[4110.32 → 4111.92] When you've truly asked
[4111.92 → 4112.66] for forgiveness,
[4113.56 → 4114.78] you will know
[4114.78 → 4116.26] because there will be
[4116.26 → 4117.42] a softness in your heart.
[4118.42 → 4118.64] Right?
[4118.68 → 4119.76] There will be a desire
[4119.76 → 4121.06] to want to say,
[4121.28 → 4122.90] what does God want
[4122.90 → 4123.66] from me now?
[4124.70 → 4124.94] Right?
[4124.98 → 4125.78] There's an eagerness
[4125.78 → 4127.06] to obey God.
[4127.30 → 4128.10] I've been forgiven.
[4128.22 → 4129.62] I've been reconciled to God.
[4129.82 → 4131.24] I agree with God.
[4131.78 → 4132.88] I want to obey him.
[4132.94 → 4134.10] I want to submit to him.
[4134.16 → 4135.66] There's this desire
[4135.66 → 4138.20] to live in light
[4138.20 → 4139.44] of who God is
[4139.44 → 4140.54] for out my good.
[4141.14 → 4142.46] So I don't have to experience
[4142.46 → 4143.74] this groaning of guilt,
[4143.86 → 4145.02] but I can enjoy
[4145.02 → 4146.28] the joy of knowing God.
[4147.64 → 4148.64] But then there's also
[4148.64 → 4150.32] this warning in verse 9.
[4150.98 → 4151.84] The next verse.
[4152.40 → 4152.76] So I don't know
[4152.76 → 4153.44] if you can see this,
[4153.54 → 4154.26] but it says,
[4154.80 → 4156.64] do not be like the horse
[4156.64 → 4157.36] or the mule,
[4157.94 → 4159.60] which have no understanding
[4159.60 → 4160.88] but must be controlled
[4160.88 → 4161.94] by bit and bridle
[4161.94 → 4163.10] or they will not come to you.
[4165.06 → 4166.42] Donkeys are so stubborn,
[4166.54 → 4166.86] aren't they?
[4167.22 → 4167.54] Mules.
[4167.54 → 4168.50] I don't know if you've ever,
[4169.64 → 4171.22] has anybody ever had a mule
[4171.22 → 4172.34] they had to try
[4172.34 → 4173.02] to bring somewhere?
[4173.84 → 4175.04] Anybody experienced this before?
[4176.22 → 4176.92] I haven't.
[4177.00 → 4177.36] I don't know.
[4177.56 → 4178.80] But you can see
[4178.80 → 4181.08] how stubborn they are.
[4181.42 → 4182.26] And so what this verse
[4182.26 → 4182.96] is saying is that
[4182.96 → 4184.76] you and I are just like this.
[4185.42 → 4186.16] Some of us,
[4186.22 → 4186.32] you know,
[4186.36 → 4187.06] in our guilt,
[4187.30 → 4188.40] we are so stubborn.
[4189.18 → 4190.68] We stand-off from God
[4190.68 → 4192.52] and maybe it's because
[4192.52 → 4193.82] we feel like I'm not worthy.
[4194.20 → 4194.96] I'm not worthy
[4194.96 → 4195.90] to go back to God.
[4195.90 → 4197.56] I need to clean myself up
[4197.56 → 4199.48] before God will accept me.
[4200.24 → 4201.72] Or we think in our sin,
[4201.82 → 4202.66] I did it again.
[4203.74 → 4204.72] I said it again.
[4204.96 → 4206.00] I looked again.
[4206.26 → 4207.62] I thought this thing again.
[4207.88 → 4208.94] I can't go to God
[4208.94 → 4209.66] in this state.
[4210.16 → 4211.82] And so we draw back
[4211.82 → 4212.78] and we're stubborn
[4212.78 → 4214.90] and we resist God.
[4215.90 → 4216.82] But David says,
[4217.08 → 4217.36] no,
[4217.68 → 4219.60] don't be like a stubborn mule
[4219.60 → 4221.14] who stands off
[4221.14 → 4222.02] when the Lord
[4222.02 → 4223.50] is inviting you to come.
[4223.50 → 4224.10] Right?
[4224.80 → 4225.90] The Lord is inviting you
[4225.90 → 4226.38] to come,
[4226.68 → 4227.90] especially
[4227.90 → 4230.34] when we feel guilty.
[4230.46 → 4231.78] His hand is upon us.
[4231.82 → 4233.20] He's drawing us to himself.
[4234.48 → 4235.54] And do you know
[4235.54 → 4237.42] that God never tires
[4237.42 → 4239.58] of your confession?
[4240.70 → 4242.50] He never tires of it.
[4242.84 → 4243.74] He loves it.
[4243.80 → 4244.40] He loves it
[4244.40 → 4245.46] when you confess to him.
[4246.18 → 4248.24] Because when you come to him,
[4248.60 → 4249.94] when you run to him,
[4249.98 → 4250.70] you are saying,
[4250.84 → 4251.06] God,
[4251.06 → 4253.42] you are the one I need.
[4253.98 → 4254.96] I have no good
[4254.96 → 4255.72] apart from you.
[4257.48 → 4259.00] And so you can never
[4259.00 → 4261.00] out-sin the Lord.
[4261.44 → 4263.08] You can never out-confess
[4263.08 → 4263.60] the Lord.
[4264.00 → 4265.44] He delights in our confession.
[4266.84 → 4268.50] You can turn to him
[4268.50 → 4269.38] in full confession
[4269.38 → 4271.60] and you can stay near to God.
[4273.08 → 4274.24] He's wanting you
[4274.24 → 4274.86] to come to him.
[4275.70 → 4276.64] And then verse 10,
[4277.64 → 4278.28] it says,
[4278.28 → 4279.38] many are the woes
[4279.38 → 4279.90] of the wicked,
[4280.86 → 4282.86] but the Lord's unfailing love
[4282.86 → 4283.70] surrounds one
[4283.70 → 4284.64] who trusts in him.
[4285.62 → 4285.86] Right?
[4285.94 → 4286.52] So that is
[4286.52 → 4287.56] the one who opens
[4287.56 → 4288.70] every door to God,
[4289.28 → 4290.26] the one who draws
[4290.26 → 4291.86] no lines in the sand
[4291.86 → 4292.56] with God,
[4292.84 → 4293.66] God surrounds
[4293.66 → 4294.46] with his love.
[4296.06 → 4296.66] And that is
[4296.66 → 4297.56] the kind of person
[4297.56 → 4298.96] that verse 11
[4298.96 → 4300.84] is talking about
[4300.84 → 4302.86] where David says,
[4303.50 → 4304.66] rejoice in the Lord
[4304.66 → 4305.42] and be glad,
[4305.62 → 4306.08] you righteous.
[4306.08 → 4307.04] Sing,
[4307.38 → 4308.10] all you
[4308.10 → 4309.60] who are upright
[4309.60 → 4310.72] in heart.
[4313.04 → 4313.90] What does it mean
[4313.90 → 4314.48] to be upright
[4314.48 → 4315.04] in heart?
[4316.20 → 4317.50] It does not mean
[4317.50 → 4318.08] to be perfect.
[4318.78 → 4319.96] It does not mean
[4319.96 → 4321.16] to be without sin.
[4322.22 → 4322.32] Right?
[4322.40 → 4323.02] The criminal
[4323.02 → 4324.28] who died on the cross
[4324.28 → 4325.02] next to Jesus,
[4325.46 → 4326.92] who in his dying breath
[4326.92 → 4327.74] is called out,
[4327.90 → 4328.92] Lord, remember me
[4328.92 → 4329.34] when you come
[4329.34 → 4330.08] into your kingdom,
[4331.14 → 4332.20] that criminal
[4332.20 → 4333.76] died upright
[4333.76 → 4334.42] in heart.
[4334.42 → 4335.48] It just means
[4335.48 → 4336.58] honest with God.
[4336.96 → 4338.06] It means uncovering
[4338.06 → 4338.66] our sin.
[4340.20 → 4340.42] You know,
[4340.48 → 4341.46] and so we might
[4341.46 → 4342.72] imagine the blessed
[4342.72 → 4343.56] life, the happy
[4343.56 → 4345.18] life, as a sinless
[4345.18 → 4345.58] life.
[4346.36 → 4347.52] You might think
[4347.52 → 4347.86] that.
[4348.56 → 4349.86] But then Psalm 32
[4349.86 → 4350.80] comes along,
[4351.16 → 4352.70] and here the blessing
[4352.70 → 4353.64] is not for the
[4353.64 → 4354.18] sinless.
[4355.02 → 4355.66] The blessing
[4355.66 → 4356.86] is for
[4356.86 → 4357.74] the forgiven.
[4358.92 → 4359.84] Because the
[4359.84 → 4360.74] steadfast love
[4360.74 → 4361.78] of God is ours
[4361.78 → 4362.58] through the cross
[4362.58 → 4363.36] of Jesus Christ.
[4363.36 → 4364.04] The blessed
[4364.04 → 4364.66] life is the
[4364.66 → 4365.24] forgiven life.
[4365.98 → 4366.94] Every time we
[4366.94 → 4368.02] sin, God
[4368.02 → 4368.74] invites us
[4368.74 → 4369.88] to look again
[4369.88 → 4371.64] to his
[4371.64 → 4372.10] forgiveness
[4372.10 → 4372.88] for us
[4372.88 → 4373.60] in Jesus
[4373.60 → 4374.06] Christ.
[4375.60 → 4375.98] And so let's
[4375.98 → 4376.40] pray that God
[4376.40 → 4376.80] would help us
[4376.80 → 4377.14] do that.
[4377.22 → 4377.68] Let's pray that
[4377.68 → 4378.12] he would help
[4378.12 → 4379.82] us to uncover
[4379.82 → 4380.52] our sin,
[4380.66 → 4381.48] to receive
[4381.48 → 4383.14] this bridle
[4383.14 → 4383.60] of him
[4383.60 → 4384.82] inviting us
[4384.82 → 4385.92] to come to
[4385.92 → 4386.16] him.
[4386.90 → 4387.56] Let's pray.
[4387.56 → 4387.60] Let's pray.
[4387.60 → 4394.60] Lord, we do
[4394.60 → 4396.84] hide ourselves
[4396.84 → 4397.46] not from
[4397.46 → 4399.28] you, but
[4399.28 → 4399.90] Lord, we hide
[4399.90 → 4400.66] ourselves in
[4400.66 → 4400.84] you.
[4401.88 → 4402.76] You are our
[4402.76 → 4403.20] refuge.
[4404.30 → 4405.18] You are our
[4405.18 → 4405.94] hiding place.
[4406.82 → 4407.66] We praise you
[4407.66 → 4408.28] that in Jesus
[4408.28 → 4408.94] there is now
[4408.94 → 4409.94] no condemnation.
[4411.14 → 4411.60] Lord, would you
[4411.60 → 4412.38] give us grace
[4412.38 → 4413.66] to quickly uncover
[4413.66 → 4414.26] our sin,
[4414.26 → 4416.18] not to try
[4416.18 → 4417.38] to solve
[4417.38 → 4417.88] it on our
[4417.88 → 4419.20] own, but
[4419.20 → 4420.14] trust in the
[4420.14 → 4421.20] precious blood
[4421.20 → 4421.70] of our Lord
[4421.70 → 4422.20] Jesus who
[4422.20 → 4423.14] died to
[4423.14 → 4423.78] remove it
[4423.78 → 4424.32] from us
[4424.32 → 4425.46] so that we
[4425.46 → 4426.20] could experience
[4426.20 → 4426.82] the joy of
[4426.82 → 4427.34] being forgiven.
[4427.86 → 4428.38] We pray
[4428.38 → 4429.40] this in
[4429.40 → 4430.02] Christ's name.
[4430.56 → 4430.80] Amen.
[4433.86 → 4434.34] Okay.
[4434.82 → 4435.54] So let's all
[4435.54 → 4436.18] stand, and we'll
[4436.18 → 4436.88] sing our song
[4436.88 → 4437.26] of response
[4437.26 → 4437.60] together.
[4444.26 → 4469.50] praise you
[4469.50 → 4470.70] praise you
[4470.70 → 4472.38] how sweet
[4472.38 → 4473.54] this sound
[4473.54 → 4475.66] that saved
[4475.66 → 4476.98] a wretch
[4476.98 → 4479.06] like me
[4479.06 → 4481.78] I once
[4481.78 → 4483.16] was lost
[4483.16 → 4484.66] but now
[4484.66 → 4486.20] I'm found
[4486.20 → 4488.06] was blind
[4488.06 → 4489.22] but now
[4489.22 → 4491.64] I see
[4491.64 → 4494.42] grace
[4494.42 → 4495.66] that taught
[4495.66 → 4497.54] my heart
[4497.54 → 4498.68] to fear
[4498.68 → 4500.22] embrace
[4500.22 → 4502.38] my fears
[4502.38 → 4503.70] relieved
[4503.70 → 4506.98] how precious
[4506.98 → 4508.90] did that
[4508.90 → 4511.12] grace appear
[4511.12 → 4513.32] the hour
[4513.32 → 4514.92] I first
[4514.92 → 4516.00] believed
[4516.00 → 4518.06] my chains
[4518.06 → 4519.62] are gone
[4519.62 → 4521.20] I've been
[4521.20 → 4522.42] set free
[4522.42 → 4524.44] my God
[4524.44 → 4525.86] my Saviour
[4525.86 → 4528.22] has wrestled
[4528.22 → 4529.22] me
[4529.22 → 4530.96] and like
[4530.96 → 4532.90] a flood
[4532.90 → 4534.20] his mercy
[4534.20 → 4535.22] reigns
[4536.10 → 4537.36] unending
[4537.36 → 4539.16] love
[4539.16 → 4540.54] amazing
[4540.54 → 4541.12] grace
[4541.12 → 4542.12] amazing
[4542.12 → 4543.12] grace
[4543.12 → 4553.60] the Lord
[4553.60 → 4555.34] has promised
[4555.34 → 4556.12] good
[4556.12 → 4557.94] to me
[4557.94 → 4559.96] his word
[4559.96 → 4561.24] my hope
[4561.24 → 4563.12] secures
[4563.12 → 4566.26] he will
[4566.26 → 4567.68] my shield
[4567.68 → 4569.64] and portion
[4569.64 → 4570.12] be
[4570.12 → 4572.12] as long
[4572.12 → 4574.34] as life
[4574.34 → 4575.12] endures
[4575.12 → 4577.56] my chains
[4577.56 → 4579.12] are gone
[4579.12 → 4580.70] I've been
[4580.70 → 4582.12] set free
[4582.12 → 4583.86] my God
[4583.86 → 4585.24] my Saviour
[4585.24 → 4587.12] has ransomed
[4587.12 → 4589.02] me
[4589.02 → 4590.80] and like a
[4590.80 → 4591.12] flood
[4591.12 → 4593.12] his mercy
[4593.76 → 4595.12] reigns
[4595.12 → 4596.12] unending
[4596.12 → 4597.12] love
[4597.12 → 4598.12] amazing
