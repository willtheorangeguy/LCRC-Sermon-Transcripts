[989.72 --> 1019.70]  Thank you.
[1019.70 --> 1049.68]  Jeremiah chapter 2.
[1049.68 --> 1079.68] 
[1079.68 --> 1109.68] 
[1109.68 --> 1109.78] 
[1139.68 --> 1144.78]  Cross over to the coast of Kittim and look, send to Kedar, and observe closely.
[1145.60 --> 1147.88]  See if there has ever been anything like this.
[1148.08 --> 1150.68]  Has a nation ever changed its gods?
[1151.30 --> 1152.60]  Yet they are not gods at all.
[1153.16 --> 1157.16]  But my people have exchanged their glory for worthless idols.
[1157.92 --> 1162.50]  Be appalled at this, O nations, and shudder with great horror, declares the Lord.
[1162.50 --> 1165.18]  My people have committed two sins.
[1165.18 --> 1175.20]  They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.
[1176.10 --> 1177.44]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1179.84 --> 1185.46]  And so, you know, that reading from Jeremiah naturally leads us into a time of confession.
[1185.80 --> 1192.28]  Because again, Jeremiah says, my people have committed two evils, two sins.
[1192.28 --> 1202.06]  They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and they have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.
[1203.10 --> 1207.04]  You know, and so God made us to receive our life from him.
[1207.94 --> 1217.26]  And he has got this everlasting, ever-flowing source of fresh, living water that he is able to give to us and that he offers to us.
[1217.26 --> 1220.64]  And it is what our hearts most deeply need and desire.
[1221.58 --> 1231.58]  And yet, in our sinfulness and our stubbornness, we go to try to find stale, salty, stagnant water to drink.
[1232.92 --> 1235.22]  Foolishly, thinking that it will be better.
[1236.68 --> 1244.20]  But actually, what it does is it always leaves us sick and actually thirsting more than ever.
[1244.20 --> 1247.26]  And so we enter now into this time of confession.
[1248.32 --> 1252.72]  And let us once again turn our hearts to the Lord, the Lord of living water.
[1253.30 --> 1258.44]  Because when we confess our sins to him, friends, he is gracious to forgive us.
[1259.08 --> 1263.54]  So would you join me in this prayer of confession as we seek the Lord, his forgiveness?
[1263.92 --> 1265.08]  So please join me in prayer.
[1265.18 --> 1265.92]  I'll pray for us.
[1265.92 --> 1274.44]  Heavenly Father, we confess to you the foolishness, Lord, of our own ways.
[1275.32 --> 1277.66]  Lord, so often we look to other things.
[1278.38 --> 1282.84]  We look to other people for the satisfaction that is only found in you.
[1284.02 --> 1286.20]  Jesus, you are the living water.
[1286.86 --> 1289.28]  You are a spring that flows up.
[1289.62 --> 1291.78]  And we can drink from forever.
[1291.78 --> 1292.02]  Ever.
[1292.92 --> 1295.98]  Lord, you are the living water that will never leave us thirsty.
[1297.18 --> 1302.82]  So please, Lord, would you keep us from going to the empty cisterns of this world,
[1302.92 --> 1305.10]  for digging our own broken cisterns.
[1305.76 --> 1308.76]  Lord, help us to seek you as the fountain of living water,
[1309.42 --> 1315.66]  to enjoy all that you offer us, all of your ways, all of your holiness,
[1315.66 --> 1321.56]  that we would delight in you and drink from your word, in your ways, in your will for our lives.
[1322.36 --> 1323.88]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[1324.42 --> 1324.72]  Amen.
[1326.24 --> 1329.08]  So now we receive these words of grace.
[1331.08 --> 1332.30]  From Isaiah 55.
[1332.80 --> 1336.32]  Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters.
[1336.80 --> 1339.60]  And you who have no money, come buy and eat.
[1340.32 --> 1344.50]  Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
[1344.50 --> 1349.46]  Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[1350.38 --> 1355.16]  Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them.
[1355.60 --> 1359.36]  And to our God, for he will freely pardon.
[1359.88 --> 1360.72]  Thanks be to God.
[1361.02 --> 1365.18]  Let's stand and let's continue to sing in response to God's grace to us.
[1365.18 --> 1365.30]  Amen.
[1374.50 --> 1389.84]  How deep the Father's love for us
[1389.84 --> 1394.88]  How vast beyond all measure
[1394.88 --> 1400.76]  That he should give his only Son
[1400.76 --> 1406.26]  To make a rash his treasure
[1406.26 --> 1413.22]  How great the pain of searing loss
[1413.22 --> 1419.00]  The Father turns his face away
[1419.00 --> 1424.88]  As wounds which marred their chosen one
[1424.88 --> 1429.68]  Bring many sons to glory
[1429.68 --> 1437.50]  Behold the man upon a cross
[1437.50 --> 1442.56]  A sin upon his shoulders
[1442.56 --> 1449.04]  Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[1449.04 --> 1454.56]  Fall out among the scoffers
[1454.56 --> 1460.50]  He was my sin that held him there
[1460.50 --> 1465.34]  Until it was accomplished
[1465.34 --> 1472.12]  His dying breath has brought me life
[1472.12 --> 1477.00]  I know that it is finished
[1477.00 --> 1484.34]  I will not boast in anything
[1484.34 --> 1489.82]  No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[1489.82 --> 1496.54]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1496.54 --> 1501.14]  His death and resurrection
[1501.14 --> 1507.44]  Why should I gain from his reward?
[1508.58 --> 1512.78]  I cannot give an answer
[1512.78 --> 1519.50]  But this I know with all my heart
[1519.50 --> 1524.44]  His wounds have paid my ransom
[1524.44 --> 1531.88]  But this I know with all my heart
[1531.88 --> 1537.22]  His wounds have paid my ransom
[1537.22 --> 1558.26]  What gift of grace
[1558.26 --> 1561.66]  Is Jesus my Redeemer?
[1561.66 --> 1564.98]  There is no more
[1564.98 --> 1568.38]  For heaven not to give
[1568.38 --> 1571.76]  He is my joy
[1571.76 --> 1575.32]  My righteousness and freedom
[1575.32 --> 1578.54]  My steadfast love
[1578.54 --> 1582.38]  My deep and boundless peace
[1582.38 --> 1585.36]  To this I hold
[1585.36 --> 1588.80]  My hope is only Jesus
[1588.80 --> 1595.52]  For my life is only bound to live
[1595.52 --> 1599.46]  Oh, how strange and divine
[1599.46 --> 1601.46]  I can see
[1601.46 --> 1605.24]  God is mine, yet not I
[1605.24 --> 1609.46]  But through Christ in me
[1609.46 --> 1622.24]  The night is dark
[1622.24 --> 1625.54]  But I am not forsaken
[1625.54 --> 1628.18]  For by my side
[1628.18 --> 1632.18]  The Savior he will stay
[1632.18 --> 1635.40]  I labor on
[1635.40 --> 1635.42]  I labor on
[1635.42 --> 1638.90]  In weakness and rejoicing
[1638.90 --> 1641.90]  For in my need
[1641.90 --> 1644.84]  His power is dismay
[1644.84 --> 1648.62]  To this I hope
[1648.62 --> 1652.56]  My shepherd will defend me
[1652.56 --> 1655.56]  Through this deep
[1655.56 --> 1658.56]  This valley he will lead
[1658.56 --> 1662.56]  Oh, the night has been warped
[1662.56 --> 1665.56]  And I shall overcome
[1665.56 --> 1668.00]  Yet nor I
[1668.00 --> 1672.28]  But through Christ in me
[1672.28 --> 1684.88]  No fate I tread
[1684.88 --> 1688.28]  I know I am forgiven
[1688.28 --> 1691.50]  The future sure
[1691.50 --> 1691.54]  The future sure
[1691.54 --> 1695.00]  The price it has been paid
[1695.00 --> 1698.28]  For Jesus bled
[1698.28 --> 1701.68]  And suffered for my pardon
[1701.68 --> 1704.84]  And he was raised
[1704.84 --> 1708.00]  To overthrow the grave
[1708.00 --> 1711.44]  To this I hope
[1711.44 --> 1714.66]  My sin has been defeated
[1714.66 --> 1719.18]  Jesus now and ever
[1719.18 --> 1721.06]  Is my plea
[1721.06 --> 1725.00]  Oh, the strings are released
[1725.64 --> 1727.24]  I can see
[1727.24 --> 1729.00]  I am free
[1729.00 --> 1730.64]  And you are
[1730.64 --> 1734.22]  But through Christ in me
[1734.22 --> 1747.22]  With every breath
[1747.22 --> 1750.60]  I long to follow Jesus
[1750.60 --> 1753.72]  For he has said
[1753.72 --> 1757.26]  That he will bring me home
[1757.26 --> 1760.20]  And day by day
[1760.20 --> 1764.20]  I know he will renew me
[1764.20 --> 1766.20]  Until I stand
[1766.74 --> 1770.58]  With joy for it home
[1770.58 --> 1773.30]  To this I hope
[1773.30 --> 1776.66]  My hope is only Jesus
[1776.66 --> 1783.58]  All the glory evermore to him
[1783.58 --> 1787.34]  When the race is complete
[1787.34 --> 1790.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1790.34 --> 1792.34]  Yet not I
[1792.34 --> 1796.34]  But through Christ in me
[1796.34 --> 1799.34]  When the race is complete
[1799.34 --> 1803.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1803.34 --> 1805.72]  Yet not I
[1805.72 --> 1809.34]  But through Christ in me
[1809.34 --> 1812.34]  Yet not I
[1812.34 --> 1816.34]  But through Christ in me
[1816.34 --> 1825.84]  Cause my�m
[1836.44 --> 1838.34]  Great singing ya all
[1838.34 --> 1840.34]  Now the children are dismissed
[1840.34 --> 1842.54]  to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1845.32 --> 1846.80]  Or you can stay if you want.
[1852.44 --> 1854.32]  So good morning, everyone.
[1854.86 --> 1856.96]  It's nice to be with you this morning.
[1857.28 --> 1860.94]  And we are in the midst of a sermon series in the book of Romans.
[1861.42 --> 1865.86]  Today we come to Romans chapter 1, verses 18 to 25.
[1865.86 --> 1873.84]  So as you're turning there in your pew Bibles, and I'll tell you the page number.
[1874.56 --> 1876.04]  It's page 837.
[1877.54 --> 1878.84]  Page 837.
[1880.16 --> 1883.66]  So as you're turning there, I wanted to give you a bit of context.
[1884.68 --> 1892.42]  So this passage is all within the context of why Paul is so eager to go to Rome to preach the gospel.
[1892.42 --> 1898.62]  And beginning in verse 15, he says, I want to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome.
[1899.12 --> 1900.80]  And then he gives us a few reasons.
[1901.74 --> 1908.32]  Firstly, he says, I am eager to preach the gospel to you because I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[1909.58 --> 1916.72]  Secondly, because the gospel is the power of God to save everyone who believes.
[1917.92 --> 1921.24]  And then thirdly, the gospel reveals God's righteousness.
[1921.24 --> 1927.96]  So Paul is like, I want to go and preach the gospel because I want people to hear the gospel.
[1928.30 --> 1934.14]  And when they do, they will realize how amazing and how awesome God is.
[1935.58 --> 1947.14]  And then fourthly, Paul says, I'm eager to preach the gospel to you because the wrath of God is directed towards those who reject him.
[1947.14 --> 1952.10]  And this is the bit that we're looking at this morning.
[1952.66 --> 1958.60]  And what Paul is doing is he's giving us a complete picture of the gospel.
[1958.60 --> 1960.90]  And he cannot do that.
[1960.96 --> 1967.30]  He cannot give us a complete picture of the gospel without talking about God's wrath.
[1967.94 --> 1974.14]  It's not a topic we like to talk about, but it is important, as we will see.
[1975.16 --> 1979.10]  Because, well, in other words, because you can't understand the power of God for salvation.
[1979.44 --> 1981.66]  You can't understand God's righteousness.
[1981.66 --> 1987.88]  You can't understand his love for sinners unless you understand our need for the gospel.
[1988.76 --> 1999.68]  Unless we need to be saved from a danger that we're in, which is God's own wrath against the sinfulness of human beings.
[2000.10 --> 2001.66]  And so let's read our passage this morning.
[2001.66 --> 2007.72]  Romans chapter 1, verses 18, and we'll go down to 25 for today.
[2009.96 --> 2012.10]  Let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2012.76 --> 2022.28]  The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men
[2022.28 --> 2025.74]  who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[2025.74 --> 2032.18]  Since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
[2032.72 --> 2040.00]  For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature,
[2040.40 --> 2046.26]  have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
[2047.04 --> 2052.66]  For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him.
[2052.66 --> 2057.10]  But their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[2057.54 --> 2064.04]  Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God
[2064.04 --> 2069.46]  for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
[2070.44 --> 2077.34]  Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual immorality or impurity
[2077.34 --> 2080.40]  for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
[2080.40 --> 2089.12]  They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served created things rather than the creator,
[2089.58 --> 2091.76]  who is forever praised.
[2092.36 --> 2092.76]  Amen.
[2093.76 --> 2095.10]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2096.98 --> 2103.54]  Let's pray together and ask for God's help as we hear and look at God's word together.
[2103.54 --> 2106.42]  Father, we thank you for your word.
[2107.20 --> 2108.48]  It is absolutely true.
[2108.94 --> 2110.76]  And you give it to us because you love us.
[2111.48 --> 2113.94]  And we pray that we would understand your word.
[2114.76 --> 2117.28]  But even more, we pray that we would believe it.
[2118.12 --> 2121.40]  And in believing, Lord, would it have an effect on us?
[2122.12 --> 2126.40]  Upon our view of you, upon our view of ourselves,
[2126.40 --> 2130.44]  and upon our view of our salvation through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[2131.08 --> 2132.36]  in whose name we pray.
[2133.02 --> 2133.38]  Amen.
[2136.22 --> 2142.96]  So I want you to imagine for a moment that you are just feeling really sick.
[2144.30 --> 2146.38]  You know, we've all had this experience, probably.
[2146.64 --> 2148.48]  You're feeling really sick.
[2149.12 --> 2149.96]  This is an example.
[2149.96 --> 2154.32]  But let's say, you know, your chest is feeling tight.
[2154.44 --> 2155.60]  You're feeling nauseous.
[2155.86 --> 2157.86]  Maybe your arms are kind of feeling tingly.
[2158.52 --> 2159.62]  You've got a headache.
[2159.74 --> 2161.06]  You've got a runny nose.
[2161.76 --> 2163.48]  You know, all kinds of things are happening.
[2164.20 --> 2165.92]  When you go to the doctor,
[2166.62 --> 2171.26]  you don't want the doctor to be, you know, Ms. Positive.
[2172.12 --> 2174.88]  You don't want the doctor to be so positive,
[2174.88 --> 2180.44]  so much that all she says to you is just stuff to make you feel better.
[2181.26 --> 2184.44]  Like, you know, you tell her all these symptoms,
[2184.70 --> 2185.72]  and she says, you know,
[2186.24 --> 2189.84]  oh, you know, it's probably nothing.
[2190.14 --> 2191.34]  Don't worry about it.
[2191.90 --> 2192.18]  Right?
[2192.26 --> 2194.02]  You're probably just a bit gassy.
[2194.52 --> 2195.12]  That's all.
[2195.96 --> 2197.18]  Have some vitamins.
[2197.88 --> 2198.90]  You'll be fine.
[2200.16 --> 2200.68]  Right?
[2200.74 --> 2202.44]  When you're feeling just awful,
[2202.44 --> 2204.56]  and you know that there's something wrong,
[2204.88 --> 2209.14]  right, you don't want the doctor just to be optimistic,
[2209.74 --> 2211.48]  to be cheery,
[2212.12 --> 2215.50]  as if that is going to solve the problem.
[2216.14 --> 2216.52]  Right?
[2216.54 --> 2219.40]  You want the doctor to tell you the truth.
[2220.06 --> 2220.30]  Right?
[2220.40 --> 2223.08]  You want a true diagnosis.
[2224.28 --> 2225.68]  And in a similar way,
[2226.36 --> 2229.30]  certainly when it comes to something as important
[2229.30 --> 2231.94]  as our relationship with God,
[2232.88 --> 2234.56]  we want to know the truth.
[2234.88 --> 2237.76]  And so like a good doctor,
[2238.18 --> 2240.02]  Paul in this passage is going to give us
[2240.02 --> 2242.92]  this incredibly important diagnosis.
[2243.78 --> 2245.34]  He's going to, with clarity,
[2245.78 --> 2247.92]  tell us the truth of our situation.
[2248.20 --> 2251.14]  Because nothing keeps people from the solution
[2251.68 --> 2254.14]  more than their inability
[2254.14 --> 2257.08]  or their unwillingness to recognize the problem.
[2257.08 --> 2260.76]  And nothing keeps people from Jesus
[2260.76 --> 2266.90]  like our unwillingness to admit our need for him.
[2268.04 --> 2271.10]  And that's why Paul shows us our need for the gospel
[2271.10 --> 2271.84]  in this passage.
[2272.30 --> 2275.54]  So that we will then run to the mercy
[2275.54 --> 2278.54]  that is offered to us in Jesus Christ.
[2279.40 --> 2280.74]  You know, and Jesus himself said,
[2281.06 --> 2281.62]  if you remember,
[2281.62 --> 2283.08]  he says,
[2283.08 --> 2285.18]  it is not the healthy who need a doctor,
[2285.56 --> 2286.94]  but who?
[2287.94 --> 2288.68]  The sick.
[2289.58 --> 2292.78]  I have not come to call the righteous,
[2293.36 --> 2294.68]  but sinners.
[2295.88 --> 2297.72]  And so let's look at our text this morning
[2297.72 --> 2299.12]  and let's see what it teaches us
[2299.12 --> 2301.16]  about our need for the gospel
[2301.16 --> 2304.24]  and the wrath of God.
[2304.24 --> 2306.32]  And so let's just jump right in
[2306.32 --> 2308.46]  and we're just going to invite you to work with me
[2308.46 --> 2309.90]  as we go through the passage.
[2310.26 --> 2312.36]  So look first at verse 18.
[2313.24 --> 2313.86]  It says this,
[2314.16 --> 2317.94]  the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[2317.94 --> 2321.36]  against all the godlessness and wickedness of people.
[2321.68 --> 2323.02]  So let's look at those two words,
[2323.20 --> 2325.26]  godlessness and wickedness.
[2325.82 --> 2329.84]  Godlessness, what that means is against God, right?
[2329.88 --> 2332.06]  So it's the vertical dimension that we have,
[2332.10 --> 2333.16]  our relationship to God.
[2333.16 --> 2335.60]  We have all rejected God's ways
[2335.60 --> 2337.38]  and we have replaced them with our own.
[2339.62 --> 2341.46]  Wickedness is against humanity.
[2341.62 --> 2343.10]  That's more of the horizontal dimension.
[2343.80 --> 2345.96]  It's all of the brokenness and the misery
[2345.96 --> 2348.66]  that we experience in this world
[2348.66 --> 2350.52]  as a result of that choice
[2350.52 --> 2352.62]  to ignore God and do what we want.
[2353.90 --> 2357.32]  And so the diagnosis of what is wrong with human beings,
[2357.66 --> 2359.08]  the Bible says,
[2359.16 --> 2360.42]  is that we are sinners.
[2360.92 --> 2362.74]  We are afflicted with sin.
[2363.16 --> 2364.42]  We don't love God.
[2364.68 --> 2365.60]  We don't love our neighbors
[2365.60 --> 2368.24]  and that fundamentally is what is wrong with us.
[2369.04 --> 2371.46]  So in the early 1900s,
[2371.54 --> 2373.28]  the London Times newspaper
[2373.28 --> 2377.18]  invited its readers to respond to a prompt,
[2377.22 --> 2377.94]  to a question,
[2377.94 --> 2382.78]  and to write an essay in response to the question
[2382.78 --> 2384.18]  and to send it in to the newspaper.
[2384.82 --> 2386.14]  The question was,
[2386.44 --> 2387.94]  what's wrong with the world?
[2389.56 --> 2390.32]  Good question.
[2390.62 --> 2391.78]  What is wrong with the world?
[2392.38 --> 2394.86]  And it's worth noting that all of us agree
[2394.86 --> 2396.54]  that something is wrong with the world.
[2397.08 --> 2397.20]  Right?
[2397.20 --> 2399.52]  Everybody knows it's not the way it should be.
[2401.16 --> 2403.38]  And in response to this question,
[2403.94 --> 2406.88]  the witty British author, G.K. Chesterton,
[2407.22 --> 2411.42]  wrote a one-sentence response.
[2412.06 --> 2413.12]  This is what he said.
[2413.64 --> 2415.10]  Dear sirs,
[2415.10 --> 2416.64]  I am.
[2417.44 --> 2418.24]  You're sincerely,
[2418.88 --> 2419.56]  G.K. Chesterton.
[2420.98 --> 2422.12]  What's wrong with the world?
[2423.46 --> 2424.18]  I am.
[2425.26 --> 2425.72]  Right?
[2426.40 --> 2427.62]  That's it in a nutshell.
[2428.36 --> 2430.26]  The problem with humanity
[2430.26 --> 2432.32]  is you,
[2432.98 --> 2433.82]  is me,
[2433.96 --> 2434.78]  is human sin.
[2435.86 --> 2436.66]  But actually,
[2437.40 --> 2438.54]  according to Paul,
[2439.18 --> 2440.24]  the diagnosis
[2440.24 --> 2442.44]  goes much deeper than that.
[2443.30 --> 2444.82]  So look again at verse 18.
[2446.12 --> 2448.34]  It's not just about godlessness and wickedness.
[2448.88 --> 2451.08]  The wrath of God is being revealed
[2451.08 --> 2453.48]  against godlessness and wickedness of people.
[2454.18 --> 2455.30]  So what Paul is saying is that
[2455.30 --> 2458.04]  the problem is not just humanity's sin.
[2458.80 --> 2460.62]  It is God's righteous anger
[2460.62 --> 2462.20]  directed against sinners.
[2463.30 --> 2465.14]  And so what we need to be saved from
[2465.14 --> 2466.46]  is not just our sins.
[2466.54 --> 2467.54]  You know, we say that all the time.
[2467.54 --> 2469.38]  I need to be saved from my sins.
[2469.38 --> 2470.22]  Well, actually,
[2470.54 --> 2472.86]  what you need to be saved from
[2472.86 --> 2474.36]  is the wrath of God
[2474.36 --> 2476.34]  that's revealed,
[2476.46 --> 2478.54]  that's directed against our sins.
[2479.76 --> 2481.20]  Now, let's be honest.
[2482.66 --> 2484.64]  We don't like to talk about
[2484.64 --> 2486.50]  this idea of an angry God.
[2487.42 --> 2488.50]  And we don't like it
[2488.50 --> 2489.36]  for a couple of reasons.
[2489.88 --> 2491.54]  One reason is that we think
[2491.54 --> 2494.76]  maybe it's unbiblical.
[2496.20 --> 2497.12]  I don't know if you think that.
[2497.12 --> 2498.18]  But, you know, like,
[2498.30 --> 2499.04]  didn't Jesus?
[2499.38 --> 2502.70]  Say that anger is just like murder?
[2503.86 --> 2504.00]  Right?
[2504.10 --> 2506.06]  Didn't Jesus say something like that?
[2506.40 --> 2508.56]  So how can God be angry?
[2508.74 --> 2509.90]  Wouldn't that be kind of inconsistent
[2509.90 --> 2510.88]  at the very least?
[2512.32 --> 2513.44]  But here's the thing.
[2513.66 --> 2515.00]  God's anger,
[2515.18 --> 2516.06]  his wrath,
[2516.36 --> 2517.74]  is not like our anger.
[2518.44 --> 2519.60]  Our anger is often,
[2519.78 --> 2520.70]  think about when you're angry.
[2521.24 --> 2523.24]  We get kind of kindled,
[2523.38 --> 2524.32]  our anger gets kindled,
[2524.32 --> 2526.86]  because often we don't get our way.
[2527.72 --> 2529.38]  Really, it's selfishness,
[2529.60 --> 2529.98]  often.
[2531.30 --> 2532.96]  And so what is God's wrath?
[2533.86 --> 2536.26]  I think the way John Stott puts it
[2536.26 --> 2536.94]  is very helpful.
[2537.94 --> 2539.28]  He says God's wrath
[2539.28 --> 2540.72]  is his settled
[2540.72 --> 2543.50]  and perfectly righteous
[2543.50 --> 2545.80]  antagonism to evil.
[2546.40 --> 2547.10]  I'll say it again.
[2547.74 --> 2549.34]  God's wrath is his settled
[2549.34 --> 2551.50]  and perfectly righteous
[2551.50 --> 2554.30]  antagonism to evil.
[2556.02 --> 2557.26]  Now, another reason
[2557.26 --> 2558.62]  we don't like the idea
[2558.62 --> 2559.60]  of an angry God
[2559.60 --> 2560.84]  is we think that
[2560.84 --> 2562.72]  anger or wrath
[2562.72 --> 2564.22]  is the opposite of love.
[2564.66 --> 2565.18]  Right?
[2565.18 --> 2567.22]  But it's not.
[2567.56 --> 2568.76]  It's absolutely not.
[2569.36 --> 2571.22]  What is the opposite of love?
[2571.80 --> 2572.50]  It's not anger.
[2573.40 --> 2574.32]  It's indifference.
[2575.60 --> 2576.28]  And thankfully,
[2576.56 --> 2578.08]  God is not indifferent
[2578.08 --> 2579.60]  to evil.
[2581.10 --> 2581.36]  You know,
[2581.46 --> 2583.36]  what is God supposed to do
[2583.36 --> 2586.04]  as he looks at this world
[2586.04 --> 2587.66]  full of the horrors
[2587.66 --> 2588.86]  of humanity?
[2589.92 --> 2590.82]  Should he just like
[2590.82 --> 2591.58]  shrug his shoulders?
[2592.40 --> 2593.38]  Should he sweep it
[2593.38 --> 2594.06]  under the rug?
[2594.06 --> 2596.10]  Should he just roll his eyes
[2596.10 --> 2596.78]  and say whatever?
[2598.38 --> 2600.64]  Imagine if God did not
[2600.64 --> 2602.44]  have an uncompromising
[2602.44 --> 2604.70]  antagonism towards rape,
[2605.64 --> 2607.96]  murder, child abuse, war.
[2608.78 --> 2609.68]  We can go on and on.
[2610.84 --> 2612.34]  What kind of God would he be
[2612.34 --> 2613.70]  if he was indifferent
[2613.70 --> 2614.40]  to all that?
[2615.20 --> 2616.66]  If God were not angry
[2616.66 --> 2617.72]  with those things,
[2617.76 --> 2618.56]  if he were indifferent
[2618.56 --> 2619.86]  to the evil of the world,
[2620.02 --> 2621.20]  he would not be good
[2621.20 --> 2622.44]  and he would not be loving.
[2622.44 --> 2625.14]  And so when you think
[2625.14 --> 2626.14]  about God's wrath,
[2626.46 --> 2627.70]  whenever you do,
[2627.78 --> 2628.58]  think about God's wrath,
[2628.88 --> 2630.34]  I want you to remember
[2630.34 --> 2631.30]  that is actually,
[2631.40 --> 2632.02]  it's an expression
[2632.02 --> 2632.74]  of his love.
[2633.82 --> 2635.04]  Wrath is the response
[2635.04 --> 2636.64]  of holy love
[2636.64 --> 2638.56]  to human sin
[2638.56 --> 2639.66]  and suffering
[2639.66 --> 2640.66]  that we inflict
[2640.66 --> 2641.38]  on one another
[2641.38 --> 2641.94]  in the world.
[2641.94 --> 2644.10]  And so, okay,
[2644.16 --> 2644.56]  you can say,
[2644.66 --> 2645.16]  great, amen.
[2645.72 --> 2646.24]  You know,
[2646.56 --> 2647.60]  I agree,
[2647.76 --> 2649.46]  God should oppose
[2649.46 --> 2650.82]  those big,
[2651.06 --> 2652.30]  horrendous evils
[2652.30 --> 2653.24]  of the world, right?
[2653.82 --> 2654.96]  I'm good with that.
[2656.62 --> 2658.04]  But where do we stop?
[2658.14 --> 2659.82]  Where does he stop
[2659.82 --> 2661.20]  opposing evil?
[2663.36 --> 2663.92]  Lust?
[2664.58 --> 2665.36]  Or lying?
[2665.36 --> 2667.76]  Or bitterness?
[2668.80 --> 2670.00]  Or backbiting?
[2670.80 --> 2672.38]  Or a critical spirit
[2672.38 --> 2673.22]  toward other people?
[2674.28 --> 2674.88]  Contempt?
[2675.90 --> 2677.06]  Where does God
[2677.06 --> 2678.14]  stop?
[2678.24 --> 2679.48]  What line would you draw?
[2680.94 --> 2681.62]  Because, you know,
[2681.64 --> 2682.60]  the problem for us
[2682.60 --> 2683.44]  is that if God
[2683.44 --> 2684.68]  is good and loving,
[2685.10 --> 2685.94]  he must oppose
[2685.94 --> 2686.68]  all evil
[2686.68 --> 2688.70]  in all of its manifestations.
[2689.76 --> 2690.62]  And the line
[2690.62 --> 2691.56]  of good and evil
[2691.56 --> 2692.74]  runs not between
[2692.74 --> 2693.96]  us and them,
[2693.96 --> 2694.96]  or between maybe
[2694.96 --> 2695.92]  our seemingly
[2695.92 --> 2696.70]  little sins
[2696.70 --> 2697.78]  and the great sins
[2697.78 --> 2698.38]  of the world,
[2698.58 --> 2699.40]  the line between
[2699.40 --> 2699.96]  good and evil
[2699.96 --> 2700.44]  runs through
[2700.44 --> 2701.40]  each human heart.
[2703.76 --> 2704.66]  And all of that
[2704.66 --> 2705.16]  is to say
[2705.16 --> 2705.86]  that we have
[2705.86 --> 2707.12]  a God of wrath
[2707.12 --> 2708.60]  and is completely
[2708.60 --> 2709.54]  consistent with
[2709.54 --> 2709.96]  the idea
[2709.96 --> 2710.90]  of a God of love.
[2711.64 --> 2712.12]  In fact,
[2712.16 --> 2712.70]  you can't have
[2712.70 --> 2713.28]  a God of love
[2713.28 --> 2713.92]  without a God
[2713.92 --> 2714.48]  who is angry
[2714.48 --> 2715.36]  against sin
[2715.36 --> 2716.54]  and because we
[2716.54 --> 2717.36]  are all sinners,
[2718.36 --> 2719.24]  all of us
[2719.24 --> 2719.90]  need the gospel.
[2721.76 --> 2722.86]  And we've seen,
[2722.94 --> 2723.12]  okay,
[2723.12 --> 2723.92]  that the object
[2723.92 --> 2724.92]  of God's anger
[2724.92 --> 2725.82]  in this passage
[2725.82 --> 2726.44]  is towards
[2726.44 --> 2727.16]  godlessness
[2727.16 --> 2727.90]  and the wickedness
[2727.90 --> 2728.32]  of people.
[2728.96 --> 2729.62]  It's the act
[2729.62 --> 2731.72]  of ignoring God,
[2732.50 --> 2733.12]  wanting to go
[2733.12 --> 2733.82]  our own way,
[2734.06 --> 2734.52]  causing,
[2734.80 --> 2735.64]  you know,
[2735.78 --> 2736.24]  brokenness
[2736.24 --> 2736.78]  in the world.
[2738.04 --> 2739.04]  And the obvious
[2739.04 --> 2740.32]  argument is,
[2740.92 --> 2741.30]  okay,
[2742.40 --> 2743.04]  but God
[2743.04 --> 2743.98]  can't be angry
[2743.98 --> 2744.92]  with me
[2744.92 --> 2746.94]  because I didn't
[2746.94 --> 2747.30]  even know
[2747.30 --> 2748.10]  there was a God.
[2749.16 --> 2749.60]  Right?
[2749.86 --> 2750.38]  Some people
[2750.38 --> 2751.04]  will say that.
[2751.04 --> 2752.64]  God can't,
[2752.68 --> 2753.46]  it's not fair
[2753.46 --> 2753.94]  for God
[2753.94 --> 2754.46]  to be angry
[2754.46 --> 2754.86]  with people
[2754.86 --> 2755.42]  who don't even
[2755.42 --> 2756.28]  know he exists.
[2757.56 --> 2758.26]  That could be
[2758.26 --> 2758.62]  an argument
[2758.62 --> 2760.06]  and Paul addresses
[2760.06 --> 2761.32]  that very quickly.
[2761.78 --> 2762.60]  So let's read
[2762.60 --> 2763.64]  now verses 18
[2763.64 --> 2764.08]  to 20.
[2765.08 --> 2766.00]  The wrath
[2766.00 --> 2766.42]  of God
[2766.42 --> 2767.18]  is being revealed
[2767.18 --> 2767.68]  from heaven
[2767.68 --> 2768.38]  against all
[2768.38 --> 2768.98]  the godlessness
[2768.98 --> 2769.68]  and wickedness
[2769.68 --> 2770.14]  of people
[2770.14 --> 2771.56]  who suppress
[2771.56 --> 2772.40]  the truth
[2772.40 --> 2773.78]  by their wickedness
[2773.78 --> 2774.94]  since what
[2774.94 --> 2775.76]  may be known
[2775.76 --> 2776.52]  about God
[2776.52 --> 2777.54]  is plain to them
[2777.54 --> 2778.16]  because God
[2778.16 --> 2779.14]  has made it
[2779.14 --> 2779.84]  plain to them.
[2779.84 --> 2781.28]  for since
[2781.28 --> 2781.94]  the creation
[2781.94 --> 2782.92]  of the world,
[2783.46 --> 2784.30]  God's invisible
[2784.30 --> 2784.92]  qualities,
[2785.16 --> 2786.18]  his eternal power
[2786.18 --> 2787.36]  and divine nature
[2787.36 --> 2788.34]  have been
[2788.34 --> 2789.72]  clearly seen
[2789.72 --> 2790.70]  being understood
[2790.70 --> 2791.66]  from what
[2791.66 --> 2792.42]  has been made
[2792.42 --> 2794.14]  so that
[2794.14 --> 2795.02]  people are
[2795.02 --> 2795.64]  without
[2795.64 --> 2796.78]  excuse.
[2798.34 --> 2798.56]  You know,
[2798.62 --> 2798.82]  friends,
[2798.96 --> 2800.20]  we live in a world
[2800.20 --> 2800.90]  that is filled
[2800.90 --> 2801.66]  with the wonderful
[2801.66 --> 2802.40]  works of God.
[2803.50 --> 2804.02]  Right?
[2804.14 --> 2804.96]  We live in a world
[2804.96 --> 2805.74]  surrounded,
[2806.30 --> 2807.78]  full of the beauty,
[2808.20 --> 2808.66]  the holiness,
[2808.66 --> 2809.26]  the majesty
[2809.26 --> 2809.90]  of God.
[2810.26 --> 2811.02]  The whole world
[2811.02 --> 2812.30]  is saying all the time,
[2812.58 --> 2812.72]  right,
[2812.76 --> 2814.24]  whether it's in the trees
[2814.24 --> 2815.18]  or the birds,
[2815.36 --> 2816.14]  the mountains,
[2816.74 --> 2817.40]  the rivers,
[2817.54 --> 2818.26]  the sunrises,
[2818.26 --> 2819.38]  it's all crying out,
[2819.68 --> 2820.72]  we did not make
[2820.72 --> 2821.26]  ourselves.
[2822.26 --> 2822.44]  Right?
[2822.58 --> 2822.76]  We,
[2823.52 --> 2824.94]  he made us.
[2825.94 --> 2827.16]  He who abides forever.
[2828.14 --> 2829.40]  Don't look at us,
[2829.66 --> 2831.00]  look beyond us,
[2831.10 --> 2832.52]  look past us
[2832.52 --> 2833.70]  to our maker.
[2833.70 --> 2835.46]  You know,
[2835.50 --> 2836.20]  and just as
[2836.20 --> 2837.30]  a painting
[2837.30 --> 2839.32]  reveals the beautiful
[2839.32 --> 2841.02]  or the qualities
[2841.02 --> 2841.84]  of a painter,
[2842.94 --> 2843.76]  their skill,
[2844.46 --> 2845.60]  their artistness,
[2846.38 --> 2847.48]  God's world
[2847.48 --> 2849.04]  speaks of him.
[2850.34 --> 2851.42]  And so even if we
[2851.42 --> 2852.04]  were to take all
[2852.04 --> 2852.58]  the Bibles
[2852.58 --> 2853.40]  and burn them,
[2854.16 --> 2854.80]  even if we were
[2854.80 --> 2855.40]  to take all the
[2855.40 --> 2855.96]  preachers
[2855.96 --> 2857.04]  and put them
[2857.04 --> 2857.60]  in a jail,
[2857.60 --> 2859.98]  God would still
[2859.98 --> 2861.30]  make his beauty,
[2861.52 --> 2862.30]  his power,
[2862.50 --> 2863.22]  and his goodness
[2863.22 --> 2864.24]  known through
[2864.24 --> 2864.96]  his creation.
[2866.44 --> 2867.18]  And in Christian
[2867.18 --> 2867.76]  theology,
[2867.98 --> 2868.48]  and this might be
[2868.48 --> 2869.20]  useful to you,
[2869.62 --> 2870.52]  this doctrine is
[2870.52 --> 2871.62]  called general
[2871.62 --> 2872.18]  revelation.
[2873.26 --> 2874.04]  The reason it's
[2874.04 --> 2874.60]  called general
[2874.60 --> 2875.32]  revelation is
[2875.32 --> 2876.70]  because God
[2876.70 --> 2877.80]  has generally
[2877.80 --> 2878.84]  revealed himself
[2878.84 --> 2879.70]  in a way that
[2879.70 --> 2880.18]  is available
[2880.18 --> 2881.32]  to all people.
[2882.04 --> 2882.74]  All people
[2882.74 --> 2883.84]  can know
[2883.84 --> 2884.58]  that there's a
[2884.58 --> 2885.40]  God who exists
[2885.40 --> 2886.60]  and a little bit
[2886.60 --> 2887.72]  about his
[2887.72 --> 2888.60]  divine nature,
[2888.72 --> 2889.54]  his eternal power.
[2890.62 --> 2891.48]  And this general
[2891.48 --> 2892.08]  revelation
[2892.08 --> 2893.42]  obligates us
[2893.42 --> 2894.98]  and calls us
[2894.98 --> 2895.74]  to worship
[2895.74 --> 2896.40]  our creator.
[2898.24 --> 2898.92]  And then general
[2898.92 --> 2899.76]  revelation is
[2899.76 --> 2900.58]  typically set in
[2900.58 --> 2901.26]  distinction from
[2901.26 --> 2901.74]  the doctrine
[2901.74 --> 2903.20]  of special revelation,
[2903.88 --> 2904.52]  which is where
[2904.52 --> 2905.24]  God has very
[2905.24 --> 2906.44]  specifically revealed
[2906.44 --> 2908.04]  himself to be
[2908.04 --> 2908.60]  the redeemer
[2908.60 --> 2910.48]  through his
[2910.48 --> 2911.54]  deeds and words
[2911.54 --> 2912.26]  in history,
[2913.42 --> 2914.10]  most, you know,
[2914.28 --> 2914.94]  consummately
[2914.94 --> 2916.20]  through Jesus
[2916.20 --> 2916.74]  Christ,
[2917.18 --> 2917.92]  who is
[2917.92 --> 2919.20]  God's greatest
[2919.20 --> 2920.30]  deed and his
[2920.30 --> 2921.04]  final word.
[2922.48 --> 2923.08]  And God's
[2923.08 --> 2924.04]  special revelation
[2924.04 --> 2924.94]  is written down
[2924.94 --> 2925.48]  for us in the
[2925.48 --> 2925.74]  Bible.
[2926.08 --> 2926.66]  And the Bible
[2926.66 --> 2927.44]  reveals things
[2927.44 --> 2928.10]  about God
[2928.10 --> 2928.90]  that we couldn't
[2928.90 --> 2930.06]  know solely
[2930.06 --> 2930.72]  by looking at
[2930.72 --> 2931.12]  the world.
[2931.88 --> 2933.04]  So he reveals
[2933.04 --> 2933.44]  it to us
[2933.44 --> 2933.92]  in his word.
[2934.56 --> 2935.00]  Okay, so we've
[2935.00 --> 2935.70]  got these two
[2935.70 --> 2937.26]  types of revelation
[2937.26 --> 2938.30]  in Christian theology.
[2938.94 --> 2939.68]  Paul here is
[2939.68 --> 2940.36]  talking about
[2940.36 --> 2941.68]  general revelation.
[2941.68 --> 2943.98]  And so as we
[2943.98 --> 2944.64]  look at this
[2944.64 --> 2945.20]  world that we
[2945.20 --> 2945.74]  live in,
[2946.64 --> 2947.42]  it's as if God
[2947.42 --> 2948.06]  is communicating
[2948.06 --> 2949.50]  to us in all
[2949.50 --> 2950.20]  kinds of ways
[2950.20 --> 2951.04]  that he exists,
[2951.30 --> 2952.34]  that he is good
[2952.34 --> 2953.24]  and he is generous
[2953.24 --> 2954.44]  and he is glorious.
[2956.14 --> 2957.42]  And what do we do?
[2957.76 --> 2958.78]  What do we human
[2958.78 --> 2959.72]  beings do in
[2959.72 --> 2960.28]  response?
[2961.96 --> 2963.40]  We suppress the
[2963.40 --> 2963.78]  truth.
[2963.78 --> 2966.66]  We were made
[2966.66 --> 2968.74]  to tune in
[2968.74 --> 2970.10]  to God's
[2970.10 --> 2970.64]  broadcast,
[2970.88 --> 2971.54]  his communication
[2971.54 --> 2972.32]  with us.
[2973.18 --> 2973.70]  We're meant to
[2973.70 --> 2974.36]  tune in,
[2974.58 --> 2975.38]  to pay attention,
[2975.50 --> 2976.06]  to receive
[2976.06 --> 2977.40]  this knowledge.
[2978.02 --> 2978.62]  And what do we
[2978.62 --> 2978.88]  do?
[2979.48 --> 2980.06]  We turn the
[2980.06 --> 2980.36]  channel.
[2981.60 --> 2982.10]  That's what we
[2982.10 --> 2982.32]  do.
[2983.28 --> 2984.34]  And we tune
[2984.34 --> 2984.92]  God out.
[2985.54 --> 2986.14]  And when we
[2986.14 --> 2986.74]  live in this
[2986.74 --> 2987.36]  world that he
[2987.36 --> 2988.02]  has made without
[2988.02 --> 2989.18]  reference to him,
[2989.80 --> 2990.36]  Paul says a
[2990.36 --> 2990.96]  couple of things
[2990.96 --> 2991.68]  happen as a
[2991.68 --> 2992.06]  result.
[2992.06 --> 2993.94]  verse 21
[2993.94 --> 2995.36]  says this,
[2995.40 --> 2995.78]  For although
[2995.78 --> 2996.32]  they knew
[2996.32 --> 2996.78]  God,
[2997.78 --> 2998.68]  they neither
[2998.68 --> 2999.62]  glorified him
[2999.62 --> 3000.30]  as God,
[3000.50 --> 3001.20]  nor gave
[3001.20 --> 3002.04]  thanks to him,
[3002.40 --> 3002.88]  but their
[3002.88 --> 3003.68]  thinking became
[3003.68 --> 3004.48]  futile and their
[3004.48 --> 3005.22]  foolish hearts
[3005.22 --> 3006.24]  were darkened.
[3007.28 --> 3007.98]  So Paul says
[3007.98 --> 3009.02]  when we tune
[3009.02 --> 3009.46]  God out,
[3009.52 --> 3010.02]  when we change
[3010.02 --> 3010.46]  the channel,
[3010.64 --> 3011.34]  when we suppress
[3011.34 --> 3012.14]  the truth that
[3012.14 --> 3012.92]  we know about
[3012.92 --> 3013.36]  God,
[3013.76 --> 3014.54]  the first thing
[3014.54 --> 3015.22]  that happens is
[3015.22 --> 3015.78]  that we don't
[3015.78 --> 3016.68]  therefore glorify
[3016.68 --> 3017.02]  God.
[3017.10 --> 3017.58]  We don't give
[3017.58 --> 3018.42]  thanks to God.
[3019.46 --> 3019.66]  Right?
[3019.72 --> 3020.38]  Every person,
[3020.52 --> 3021.08]  we were all
[3021.08 --> 3022.00]  created by
[3022.00 --> 3022.40]  God,
[3022.92 --> 3023.40]  we were
[3023.40 --> 3024.00]  created to
[3024.00 --> 3025.28]  depend on
[3025.28 --> 3026.76]  him for
[3026.76 --> 3027.50]  our breath,
[3027.82 --> 3028.46]  for our
[3028.46 --> 3028.96]  life,
[3029.08 --> 3029.76]  for everything
[3029.76 --> 3030.38]  we need.
[3031.06 --> 3031.32]  And so
[3031.32 --> 3032.04]  what's the
[3032.04 --> 3033.14]  proper response?
[3034.72 --> 3035.28]  Gratitude.
[3036.34 --> 3036.48]  Right?
[3036.74 --> 3037.26]  Gratitude.
[3038.58 --> 3039.04]  And if
[3039.04 --> 3039.46]  you're,
[3039.64 --> 3039.84]  you know,
[3039.92 --> 3040.30]  think about
[3040.30 --> 3041.00]  if your view
[3041.00 --> 3041.42]  of human
[3041.42 --> 3042.02]  beings is
[3042.02 --> 3042.34]  that we're
[3042.34 --> 3043.02]  just animals
[3043.02 --> 3044.12]  on a quest
[3044.12 --> 3044.50]  for self
[3044.50 --> 3044.94]  fulfillment,
[3046.20 --> 3047.30]  then admittedly
[3047.30 --> 3048.36]  we would have
[3048.36 --> 3048.90]  no reason
[3048.90 --> 3049.66]  for gratitude.
[3049.66 --> 3049.78]  gratitude.
[3050.98 --> 3051.68]  But in the
[3051.68 --> 3052.02]  Bible,
[3052.52 --> 3053.14]  we actually
[3053.14 --> 3054.44]  have not
[3054.44 --> 3054.94]  a view of
[3054.94 --> 3055.76]  humanity that's
[3055.76 --> 3056.22]  like low,
[3056.30 --> 3056.64]  that we're just
[3056.64 --> 3057.00]  animals,
[3057.00 --> 3057.58]  we have an
[3057.58 --> 3058.90]  exalted view
[3058.90 --> 3059.56]  of humanity.
[3061.12 --> 3061.36]  And so
[3061.36 --> 3062.06]  John Calvin
[3062.06 --> 3062.68]  puts it like
[3062.68 --> 3063.10]  this.
[3064.80 --> 3065.48]  What does it
[3065.48 --> 3066.12]  mean to be a
[3066.12 --> 3066.40]  human?
[3067.26 --> 3068.32]  To be human
[3068.32 --> 3069.52]  means to be
[3069.52 --> 3070.24]  that place
[3070.24 --> 3071.16]  in the cosmos
[3071.16 --> 3072.60]  which responds
[3072.60 --> 3073.70]  to the goodness
[3073.70 --> 3074.30]  of God
[3074.30 --> 3075.44]  with gratitude.
[3077.40 --> 3078.56]  To be human
[3078.56 --> 3079.52]  means to be
[3079.52 --> 3080.04]  that place
[3080.04 --> 3080.66]  in the cosmos
[3080.66 --> 3082.02]  which responds
[3082.02 --> 3082.58]  to the goodness
[3082.58 --> 3083.10]  of God
[3083.10 --> 3084.28]  with gratitude.
[3085.12 --> 3085.72]  That's what it
[3085.72 --> 3086.20]  means to be a
[3086.20 --> 3086.74]  human being.
[3086.98 --> 3087.62]  That's our job.
[3087.72 --> 3088.12]  That's like
[3088.12 --> 3089.14]  our role
[3089.14 --> 3089.68]  in God's
[3089.68 --> 3090.12]  creation
[3090.12 --> 3091.90]  is to glorify
[3091.90 --> 3092.52]  him and to
[3092.52 --> 3093.20]  respond to him
[3093.20 --> 3093.72]  in thanks.
[3096.76 --> 3097.36]  But we
[3097.36 --> 3098.28]  refuse to do it.
[3099.28 --> 3099.94]  We refuse
[3099.94 --> 3100.76]  to acknowledge
[3100.76 --> 3101.18]  the God
[3101.18 --> 3101.84]  who made us,
[3102.34 --> 3102.84]  the one
[3102.84 --> 3103.48]  in whom we
[3103.48 --> 3104.08]  live and move
[3104.08 --> 3104.50]  and have our
[3104.50 --> 3104.80]  being.
[3105.54 --> 3105.96]  And what
[3105.96 --> 3106.58]  happens as a
[3106.58 --> 3107.00]  result
[3107.00 --> 3108.80]  is inevitable.
[3109.58 --> 3110.24]  Paul says
[3110.24 --> 3110.86]  what we do
[3110.86 --> 3111.68]  is we create
[3111.68 --> 3112.22]  a God
[3112.22 --> 3113.38]  or religion
[3113.38 --> 3115.02]  that is false
[3115.02 --> 3116.46]  to replace
[3116.46 --> 3116.76]  God.
[3117.52 --> 3118.18]  So look with
[3118.18 --> 3118.78]  me at verses
[3118.78 --> 3119.90]  22 and 23.
[3121.42 --> 3122.10]  Paul writes,
[3122.32 --> 3123.16]  although they
[3123.16 --> 3124.18]  claimed to be
[3124.18 --> 3124.90]  wise,
[3125.46 --> 3126.00]  you know so many
[3126.00 --> 3126.68]  people they make
[3126.68 --> 3127.96]  wise pronouncements
[3127.96 --> 3128.74]  about who God
[3128.74 --> 3129.52]  is or what
[3129.52 --> 3130.82]  we should
[3130.82 --> 3131.22]  believe.
[3131.22 --> 3134.04]  although they
[3134.04 --> 3134.60]  claimed to be
[3134.60 --> 3135.08]  wise,
[3136.08 --> 3136.56]  it's actually
[3136.56 --> 3137.28]  foolishness.
[3138.00 --> 3138.44]  They don't
[3138.44 --> 3139.38]  know God.
[3140.34 --> 3141.12]  They became
[3141.12 --> 3142.18]  fools and they
[3142.18 --> 3143.00]  exchanged the
[3143.00 --> 3143.72]  glory of the
[3143.72 --> 3144.52]  immortal God
[3144.52 --> 3145.58]  for images
[3145.58 --> 3146.32]  made to look
[3146.32 --> 3146.82]  like a mortal
[3146.82 --> 3147.54]  human being.
[3148.76 --> 3149.40]  Birds and
[3149.40 --> 3149.94]  animals and
[3149.94 --> 3150.58]  reptiles.
[3151.68 --> 3152.12]  Then if you
[3152.12 --> 3152.76]  jump to
[3152.76 --> 3154.26]  verse 25,
[3155.26 --> 3156.12]  it says,
[3156.12 --> 3157.00]  they exchanged
[3157.00 --> 3157.56]  the truth
[3157.56 --> 3158.20]  about God
[3158.20 --> 3158.90]  for a lie
[3158.90 --> 3160.10]  and worshipped
[3160.10 --> 3160.56]  and served
[3160.56 --> 3161.56]  created things
[3161.56 --> 3162.08]  rather than
[3162.08 --> 3162.64]  the creator
[3162.64 --> 3163.76]  who is forever
[3163.76 --> 3164.26]  praised.
[3164.40 --> 3164.64]  Amen.
[3165.58 --> 3166.02]  And so God,
[3166.18 --> 3166.34]  you know,
[3166.48 --> 3167.30]  Paul is saying
[3167.30 --> 3167.66]  here,
[3168.52 --> 3169.72]  we were made
[3169.72 --> 3170.68]  for God.
[3170.82 --> 3171.48]  We were made
[3171.48 --> 3172.30]  to find our
[3172.30 --> 3172.96]  life in him,
[3173.04 --> 3174.04]  to worship him,
[3174.76 --> 3175.44]  to give thanks
[3175.44 --> 3175.94]  to him,
[3175.94 --> 3177.62]  but we prefer
[3177.62 --> 3178.98]  alternatives.
[3179.94 --> 3180.02]  Right?
[3180.10 --> 3180.80]  Paul says we
[3180.80 --> 3182.42]  exchange one
[3182.42 --> 3183.18]  thing for another.
[3183.42 --> 3183.92]  We do this
[3183.92 --> 3185.28]  exchange.
[3186.44 --> 3186.60]  You know,
[3186.64 --> 3186.98]  and we do
[3186.98 --> 3187.12]  this.
[3187.16 --> 3187.60]  So here's an
[3187.60 --> 3187.96]  example.
[3188.60 --> 3188.92]  So this
[3188.92 --> 3189.44]  afternoon,
[3189.74 --> 3190.54]  I will go
[3190.54 --> 3191.20]  grocery shopping.
[3191.94 --> 3192.42]  There's a big
[3192.42 --> 3192.80]  list,
[3193.00 --> 3193.34]  always,
[3193.78 --> 3194.26]  with four kids,
[3194.34 --> 3194.78]  five kids in
[3194.78 --> 3195.06]  the house.
[3196.28 --> 3196.98]  Not to count,
[3197.06 --> 3197.18]  no,
[3197.24 --> 3197.84]  myself as well.
[3198.10 --> 3198.38]  Anyway,
[3198.48 --> 3198.74]  anyway,
[3198.92 --> 3199.66]  so I'm going
[3199.66 --> 3199.96]  to go to the
[3199.96 --> 3200.50]  grocery store,
[3200.60 --> 3200.78]  I'm going to
[3200.78 --> 3201.40]  buy groceries,
[3201.90 --> 3202.28]  and what I'm
[3202.28 --> 3202.74]  going to do,
[3202.84 --> 3203.64]  I'm going to
[3203.64 --> 3205.56]  give the
[3205.56 --> 3206.32]  cashier money,
[3206.42 --> 3206.64]  right?
[3208.14 --> 3208.90]  I'm going to
[3208.90 --> 3210.00]  exchange money
[3210.00 --> 3210.92]  for food.
[3211.74 --> 3212.70]  Why do I do
[3212.70 --> 3213.04]  this?
[3213.04 --> 3213.58]  Well,
[3213.64 --> 3214.24]  because what
[3214.24 --> 3214.78]  do I prefer?
[3215.60 --> 3216.92]  I prefer a
[3216.92 --> 3217.68]  full stomach
[3217.68 --> 3218.56]  to a full
[3218.56 --> 3218.96]  wallet.
[3219.46 --> 3220.20]  It's based on
[3220.20 --> 3220.74]  my preferences.
[3221.94 --> 3222.60]  And so why do
[3222.60 --> 3223.38]  you exchange one
[3223.38 --> 3224.06]  thing for another?
[3225.06 --> 3226.02]  You exchange one
[3226.02 --> 3226.52]  thing for another
[3226.52 --> 3227.02]  based on your
[3227.02 --> 3227.40]  preferences,
[3227.50 --> 3228.16]  to get what you
[3228.16 --> 3228.62]  want.
[3229.56 --> 3230.52]  And what human
[3230.52 --> 3231.38]  beings do is
[3231.38 --> 3232.16]  instead of
[3232.16 --> 3233.40]  wanting God,
[3233.48 --> 3233.88]  instead of
[3233.88 --> 3234.66]  worshiping God,
[3234.78 --> 3235.52]  wanting him to
[3235.52 --> 3236.26]  be our creator,
[3236.98 --> 3238.56]  we exchange him
[3238.56 --> 3239.38]  for something else.
[3239.42 --> 3240.20]  We go and find
[3240.20 --> 3241.50]  another God to
[3241.50 --> 3241.76]  worship.
[3241.76 --> 3243.40]  one that we
[3243.40 --> 3244.00]  create,
[3244.76 --> 3245.44]  one that we
[3245.44 --> 3246.16]  can control.
[3247.64 --> 3248.34]  And Paul says,
[3248.84 --> 3249.12]  you know,
[3249.20 --> 3249.96]  it's not like we're
[3249.96 --> 3250.60]  going to not
[3250.60 --> 3251.32]  worship God,
[3251.40 --> 3251.88]  and then just not
[3251.88 --> 3252.52]  worship anything,
[3253.02 --> 3253.96]  because we were
[3253.96 --> 3255.04]  created to worship.
[3256.12 --> 3257.16]  It's only
[3257.16 --> 3257.88]  worship God,
[3257.92 --> 3258.44]  or worship
[3258.44 --> 3259.18]  something else.
[3260.04 --> 3260.56]  And what Paul
[3260.56 --> 3260.84]  says,
[3260.92 --> 3261.34]  humanity,
[3261.54 --> 3262.04]  in our sin,
[3262.42 --> 3263.98]  we tune God
[3263.98 --> 3264.30]  out,
[3264.96 --> 3265.48]  and we find
[3265.48 --> 3266.30]  anything else,
[3266.30 --> 3267.14]  all kinds of
[3267.14 --> 3267.48]  stuff,
[3268.00 --> 3268.50]  to worship.
[3271.90 --> 3272.76]  And as you
[3272.76 --> 3272.86]  know,
[3272.94 --> 3273.86]  in these words,
[3273.98 --> 3274.44]  Paul simply
[3274.44 --> 3275.16]  says that we've
[3275.16 --> 3275.72]  taken our
[3275.72 --> 3276.28]  hearts,
[3276.90 --> 3277.12]  right,
[3277.18 --> 3277.52]  that we're
[3277.52 --> 3278.18]  meant to
[3278.18 --> 3278.72]  praise God
[3278.72 --> 3279.22]  and to thank
[3279.22 --> 3279.48]  him,
[3279.84 --> 3280.58]  and we've
[3280.58 --> 3280.88]  set our
[3280.88 --> 3281.36]  hearts on
[3281.36 --> 3282.08]  lesser things.
[3282.62 --> 3282.96]  And that's
[3282.96 --> 3283.30]  what sin
[3283.30 --> 3284.08]  does to us.
[3284.64 --> 3285.02]  And it's
[3285.02 --> 3285.66]  why God
[3285.66 --> 3286.80]  is rightly
[3286.80 --> 3287.82]  angry
[3287.82 --> 3289.58]  with humanity.
[3289.58 --> 3291.64]  So lastly,
[3291.96 --> 3292.62]  how does
[3292.62 --> 3293.48]  God respond?
[3293.58 --> 3293.98]  What's God's
[3293.98 --> 3294.62]  response to
[3294.62 --> 3294.92]  this?
[3296.42 --> 3297.26]  What is,
[3297.60 --> 3299.06]  what does
[3299.06 --> 3299.94]  God's wrath
[3299.94 --> 3301.02]  look like?
[3301.30 --> 3301.92]  And what it
[3301.92 --> 3302.70]  looks like
[3302.70 --> 3304.14]  is judgment.
[3304.92 --> 3305.62]  Another fun
[3305.62 --> 3306.00]  word for
[3306.00 --> 3306.30]  today.
[3307.68 --> 3308.50]  The outworking
[3308.50 --> 3309.50]  of God's wrath
[3309.50 --> 3310.44]  is judgment.
[3311.44 --> 3312.00]  And we see
[3312.00 --> 3312.56]  that in verse
[3312.56 --> 3313.22]  24.
[3314.82 --> 3315.14]  Therefore,
[3315.72 --> 3316.68]  God gave
[3316.68 --> 3317.26]  them over
[3317.26 --> 3318.50]  in the sinful
[3318.50 --> 3319.08]  desires,
[3319.58 --> 3319.94]  of their
[3319.94 --> 3320.32]  hearts.
[3321.80 --> 3321.94]  Okay?
[3322.36 --> 3322.82]  Therefore,
[3323.08 --> 3323.64]  God gave
[3323.64 --> 3324.08]  them over
[3324.08 --> 3325.04]  in the sinful
[3325.04 --> 3325.68]  desires of
[3325.68 --> 3326.16]  their hearts.
[3326.66 --> 3327.48]  So when it
[3327.48 --> 3328.20]  comes to
[3328.20 --> 3329.14]  God's judgment,
[3329.48 --> 3330.00]  I think we
[3330.00 --> 3330.70]  most often
[3330.70 --> 3331.46]  think of
[3331.46 --> 3332.94]  God's future
[3332.94 --> 3333.36]  judgment.
[3334.20 --> 3334.42]  Right?
[3334.48 --> 3334.96]  When God
[3334.96 --> 3335.98]  finally comes
[3335.98 --> 3336.84]  in the future
[3336.84 --> 3337.68]  to vindicate
[3337.68 --> 3338.30]  his people,
[3338.70 --> 3339.50]  to remove
[3339.50 --> 3340.56]  all wickedness,
[3341.10 --> 3341.56]  to make
[3341.56 --> 3342.60]  everything right,
[3342.72 --> 3343.42]  the new heavens
[3343.42 --> 3343.84]  and the new
[3343.84 --> 3344.18]  earth.
[3345.06 --> 3345.80]  And that's
[3345.80 --> 3346.44]  what we confess
[3346.44 --> 3347.04]  in the Apostles
[3347.04 --> 3347.52]  Creed, right?
[3347.58 --> 3347.80]  You know,
[3347.92 --> 3348.70]  Jesus will come
[3348.70 --> 3349.42]  again to judge
[3349.42 --> 3349.76]  the living
[3349.76 --> 3350.20]  and the dead.
[3350.86 --> 3351.46]  That will
[3351.46 --> 3351.86]  happen.
[3352.28 --> 3352.80]  But that is
[3352.80 --> 3353.50]  not the only
[3353.50 --> 3354.26]  act of judgment.
[3354.44 --> 3354.68]  You see,
[3354.78 --> 3355.32]  this passage
[3355.32 --> 3356.00]  tells us
[3356.00 --> 3357.44]  that God's
[3357.44 --> 3358.00]  judgment is
[3358.00 --> 3358.60]  happening right
[3358.60 --> 3358.86]  now.
[3360.08 --> 3360.50]  That's what
[3360.50 --> 3361.12]  this kind of
[3361.12 --> 3362.10]  God gave
[3362.10 --> 3362.72]  them over
[3362.72 --> 3363.90]  language is
[3363.90 --> 3364.34]  all about.
[3364.48 --> 3365.50]  That's judgment
[3365.50 --> 3367.12]  happening now.
[3367.56 --> 3368.62]  As we currently
[3368.62 --> 3369.48]  now live
[3369.48 --> 3370.40]  under the curse
[3370.40 --> 3370.86]  of God
[3370.86 --> 3371.46]  in this world
[3371.46 --> 3372.72]  because of
[3372.72 --> 3373.18]  the sins
[3373.18 --> 3373.78]  of the world.
[3375.72 --> 3376.12]  Okay?
[3376.12 --> 3376.60]  So there's
[3376.60 --> 3377.60]  a future
[3377.60 --> 3378.14]  aspect of
[3378.14 --> 3378.42]  judgment
[3378.42 --> 3378.92]  but also
[3378.92 --> 3379.22]  there's
[3379.22 --> 3379.64]  a present
[3379.64 --> 3380.22]  aspect of
[3380.22 --> 3380.50]  judgment.
[3380.98 --> 3381.18]  And then
[3381.18 --> 3381.72]  another thing
[3381.72 --> 3382.00]  we need
[3382.00 --> 3382.50]  to know
[3382.50 --> 3383.32]  about judgment
[3383.32 --> 3383.68]  from the
[3383.68 --> 3383.96]  Bible
[3383.96 --> 3385.72]  is that
[3385.72 --> 3386.14]  it's talked
[3386.14 --> 3386.52]  about in
[3386.52 --> 3387.14]  two ways.
[3388.14 --> 3388.68]  So on the
[3388.68 --> 3389.18]  one hand
[3389.18 --> 3389.64]  there is
[3389.64 --> 3390.14]  active
[3390.14 --> 3390.60]  judgment
[3390.60 --> 3391.68]  which is
[3391.68 --> 3391.94]  God
[3391.94 --> 3392.54]  actively
[3392.54 --> 3393.42]  intervening
[3393.42 --> 3393.74]  in a
[3393.74 --> 3394.26]  situation
[3394.26 --> 3395.76]  in the
[3395.76 --> 3396.02]  world
[3396.02 --> 3396.98]  to oppose
[3396.98 --> 3397.44]  sin.
[3398.14 --> 3398.36]  Right?
[3398.40 --> 3398.64]  You can
[3398.64 --> 3399.02]  think of
[3399.02 --> 3399.66]  Noah's flood
[3399.66 --> 3400.00]  as an
[3400.00 --> 3400.50]  example of
[3400.50 --> 3400.66]  this.
[3400.72 --> 3400.86]  Right?
[3400.90 --> 3401.30]  The world's
[3401.30 --> 3401.84]  messed up,
[3401.84 --> 3402.90]  God intervenes.
[3402.90 --> 3404.86]  But there's
[3404.86 --> 3405.68]  also judgment
[3405.68 --> 3406.06]  in the
[3406.06 --> 3406.38]  Bible
[3406.38 --> 3407.50]  that is
[3407.50 --> 3407.84]  called
[3407.84 --> 3408.68]  passive
[3408.68 --> 3409.42]  judgment.
[3409.54 --> 3409.80]  Not just
[3409.80 --> 3410.22]  active
[3410.22 --> 3410.52]  judgment
[3410.52 --> 3411.22]  but passive
[3411.22 --> 3411.58]  judgment
[3411.58 --> 3412.36]  which is
[3412.36 --> 3412.74]  to say
[3412.74 --> 3413.18]  God
[3413.18 --> 3413.62]  doesn't
[3413.62 --> 3414.06]  intervene.
[3415.14 --> 3415.72]  In fact
[3415.72 --> 3416.28]  God
[3416.28 --> 3416.80]  refuses
[3416.80 --> 3417.92]  to intervene
[3417.92 --> 3419.12]  and he
[3419.12 --> 3420.06]  lets sin
[3420.06 --> 3421.30]  take its
[3421.30 --> 3421.86]  own course.
[3422.46 --> 3422.90]  He lets
[3422.90 --> 3423.60]  it work
[3423.60 --> 3424.62]  itself out
[3424.62 --> 3425.24]  towards
[3425.24 --> 3425.80]  its
[3425.80 --> 3426.40]  destructive
[3426.40 --> 3427.18]  ends.
[3427.98 --> 3428.20]  And so
[3428.20 --> 3428.54]  judgment
[3428.54 --> 3428.96]  is being
[3428.96 --> 3429.32]  done
[3429.32 --> 3430.14]  by God
[3430.14 --> 3430.36]  not
[3430.36 --> 3430.96]  intervening.
[3432.00 --> 3432.12]  So
[3432.12 --> 3433.00]  Athanasius
[3433.00 --> 3433.48]  who was
[3433.48 --> 3433.86]  an early
[3433.86 --> 3434.16]  church
[3434.16 --> 3434.54]  father
[3434.54 --> 3435.26]  in his
[3435.26 --> 3435.52]  book
[3435.52 --> 3435.88]  on the
[3435.88 --> 3436.42]  incarnation
[3436.42 --> 3437.56]  he says
[3437.56 --> 3437.84]  it this
[3437.84 --> 3438.08]  way
[3438.08 --> 3438.78]  God
[3438.78 --> 3439.38]  made us
[3439.38 --> 3439.60]  from
[3439.60 --> 3440.12]  nothing
[3440.12 --> 3440.90]  and
[3440.90 --> 3441.12]  through
[3441.12 --> 3441.36]  our
[3441.36 --> 3441.84]  sin
[3441.84 --> 3442.28]  we
[3442.28 --> 3442.80]  corrupt
[3442.80 --> 3443.80]  ourselves
[3443.80 --> 3444.62]  back
[3444.62 --> 3445.16]  into
[3445.16 --> 3445.56]  nothing.
[3449.62 --> 3449.78]  And so
[3449.78 --> 3450.16]  God's
[3450.16 --> 3450.74]  passive
[3450.74 --> 3451.28]  judgment
[3451.28 --> 3452.50]  is his
[3452.50 --> 3453.16]  refusal
[3453.16 --> 3453.56]  to
[3453.56 --> 3454.28]  intervene
[3454.28 --> 3455.18]  in that
[3455.18 --> 3455.76]  process.
[3457.24 --> 3458.06]  He
[3458.06 --> 3458.32]  just
[3458.32 --> 3458.70]  lets
[3458.70 --> 3459.42]  sin
[3459.42 --> 3460.56]  actually
[3460.56 --> 3461.00]  corrupt
[3461.00 --> 3461.36]  us.
[3462.12 --> 3462.96]  And it's
[3462.96 --> 3463.18]  this
[3463.18 --> 3463.80]  subtle
[3463.80 --> 3464.78]  handing
[3464.78 --> 3465.48]  sinners
[3465.48 --> 3465.90]  over
[3465.90 --> 3466.20]  to
[3466.20 --> 3466.92]  themselves
[3466.92 --> 3467.98]  that
[3467.98 --> 3468.48]  Paul
[3468.48 --> 3468.66]  is
[3468.66 --> 3469.00]  talking
[3469.00 --> 3469.42]  about
[3469.42 --> 3469.96]  here.
[3471.08 --> 3471.56]  Because
[3471.56 --> 3472.02]  look again
[3472.02 --> 3472.34]  at verse
[3472.34 --> 3472.86]  24.
[3473.86 --> 3474.10]  Therefore
[3474.10 --> 3474.72]  God
[3474.72 --> 3475.58]  gave
[3475.58 --> 3475.74]  them
[3475.74 --> 3476.08]  over
[3476.08 --> 3476.78]  in
[3476.78 --> 3477.16]  their
[3477.16 --> 3477.74]  in
[3477.74 --> 3477.88]  the
[3477.88 --> 3478.24]  sinful
[3478.24 --> 3478.82]  desires
[3478.82 --> 3479.54]  of
[3479.54 --> 3479.80]  their
[3479.80 --> 3480.26]  hearts.
[3481.94 --> 3482.58]  So
[3482.58 --> 3482.82]  what does
[3482.82 --> 3483.12]  that mean
[3483.12 --> 3483.42]  for us
[3483.42 --> 3483.62]  this
[3483.62 --> 3483.88]  morning?
[3483.88 --> 3485.60]  it
[3485.60 --> 3486.02]  means
[3486.02 --> 3486.58]  if
[3486.58 --> 3487.18]  you
[3487.18 --> 3487.36]  or
[3487.36 --> 3487.68]  I
[3487.68 --> 3487.98]  are
[3487.98 --> 3488.34]  kind
[3488.34 --> 3488.46]  of
[3488.46 --> 3489.08]  harboring
[3489.08 --> 3489.54]  hidden
[3489.54 --> 3490.14]  sins
[3490.14 --> 3491.42]  and
[3491.42 --> 3491.56]  you
[3491.56 --> 3491.82]  think
[3491.82 --> 3491.96]  you're
[3491.96 --> 3492.20]  getting
[3492.20 --> 3492.48]  away
[3492.48 --> 3492.68]  with
[3492.68 --> 3492.94]  it
[3492.94 --> 3494.98]  think
[3494.98 --> 3495.32]  again.
[3496.62 --> 3497.26]  God
[3497.26 --> 3497.64]  may
[3497.64 --> 3498.04]  just
[3498.04 --> 3498.30]  be
[3498.30 --> 3498.64]  handing
[3498.64 --> 3499.00]  you
[3499.00 --> 3499.40]  over
[3499.40 --> 3500.04]  to
[3500.04 --> 3500.24]  the
[3500.24 --> 3500.50]  very
[3500.50 --> 3500.86]  thing
[3500.86 --> 3501.08]  that
[3501.08 --> 3501.28]  you
[3501.28 --> 3501.70]  want
[3501.70 --> 3501.98]  more
[3501.98 --> 3502.16]  than
[3502.16 --> 3502.38]  him.
[3503.72 --> 3504.24]  And
[3504.24 --> 3504.54]  that
[3504.54 --> 3505.12]  is
[3505.12 --> 3505.46]  truly
[3505.46 --> 3505.94]  terrifying.
[3505.94 --> 3508.08]  And
[3508.08 --> 3508.32]  that's
[3508.32 --> 3508.52]  why
[3508.52 --> 3508.68]  we
[3508.68 --> 3508.84]  want
[3508.84 --> 3508.94]  to
[3508.94 --> 3509.22]  bring
[3509.22 --> 3509.44]  our
[3509.44 --> 3509.66]  sin
[3509.66 --> 3509.86]  out
[3509.86 --> 3510.00]  in
[3510.00 --> 3510.10]  the
[3510.10 --> 3510.42]  open.
[3510.96 --> 3511.30]  We
[3511.30 --> 3511.52]  want
[3511.52 --> 3511.66]  to
[3511.66 --> 3511.94]  deal
[3511.94 --> 3512.10]  with
[3512.10 --> 3512.16]  it.
[3512.22 --> 3512.28]  We
[3512.28 --> 3512.44]  want
[3512.44 --> 3512.54]  to
[3512.54 --> 3512.90]  confess
[3512.90 --> 3513.40]  it.
[3513.72 --> 3514.14]  Because
[3514.14 --> 3514.44]  even
[3514.44 --> 3514.72]  though
[3514.72 --> 3514.94]  it
[3514.94 --> 3515.08]  can
[3515.08 --> 3515.24]  be
[3515.24 --> 3515.62]  hard
[3515.62 --> 3515.82]  for
[3515.82 --> 3516.04]  us
[3516.04 --> 3516.32]  to
[3516.32 --> 3517.12]  acknowledge
[3517.12 --> 3517.56]  our
[3517.56 --> 3518.10]  sin
[3518.10 --> 3518.34]  and
[3518.34 --> 3518.52]  the
[3518.52 --> 3518.84]  shame
[3518.84 --> 3518.98]  and
[3518.98 --> 3519.30]  guilt
[3519.30 --> 3519.46]  of
[3519.46 --> 3519.64]  our
[3519.64 --> 3519.94]  sin
[3519.94 --> 3520.48]  it
[3520.48 --> 3520.62]  is
[3520.62 --> 3520.80]  a
[3520.80 --> 3521.00]  whole
[3521.00 --> 3521.24]  lot
[3521.24 --> 3521.58]  better
[3521.58 --> 3522.58]  to
[3522.58 --> 3522.76]  do
[3522.76 --> 3523.06]  that
[3523.06 --> 3523.20]  and
[3523.20 --> 3523.32]  to
[3523.32 --> 3523.50]  be
[3523.50 --> 3523.94]  healed
[3523.94 --> 3525.62]  than
[3525.62 --> 3525.84]  to
[3525.84 --> 3526.04]  be
[3526.04 --> 3526.26]  given
[3526.26 --> 3526.54]  up
[3526.54 --> 3526.78]  to
[3526.78 --> 3527.02]  it.
[3529.02 --> 3529.50]  All
[3529.50 --> 3529.62]  right.
[3529.72 --> 3529.90]  So
[3529.90 --> 3530.62]  let's
[3530.62 --> 3530.88]  wrap
[3530.88 --> 3531.18]  up
[3531.18 --> 3531.54]  here.
[3533.60 --> 3533.74]  You
[3533.74 --> 3533.84]  know
[3533.84 --> 3534.30]  Paul
[3534.30 --> 3535.30]  originally
[3535.30 --> 3535.66]  as I
[3535.66 --> 3535.94]  mentioned
[3535.94 --> 3536.36]  in the
[3536.36 --> 3536.62]  beginning
[3536.62 --> 3536.86]  he
[3536.86 --> 3537.26]  said
[3537.26 --> 3538.34]  I'm
[3538.34 --> 3538.52]  not
[3538.52 --> 3538.82]  ashamed
[3538.82 --> 3538.96]  of
[3538.96 --> 3539.06]  the
[3539.06 --> 3539.34]  gospel.
[3539.58 --> 3539.72]  Why
[3539.72 --> 3539.90]  is
[3539.90 --> 3540.06]  Paul
[3540.06 --> 3540.26]  not
[3540.26 --> 3540.52]  ashamed
[3540.52 --> 3540.66]  of
[3540.66 --> 3540.76]  the
[3540.76 --> 3541.08]  gospel?
[3541.82 --> 3542.18]  It's
[3542.18 --> 3542.42]  because
[3542.42 --> 3542.64]  the
[3542.64 --> 3543.00]  gospel
[3543.00 --> 3543.24]  is
[3543.24 --> 3543.40]  that
[3543.40 --> 3543.62]  God
[3543.62 --> 3544.36]  himself
[3544.36 --> 3545.36]  has
[3545.36 --> 3545.76]  saved
[3545.76 --> 3546.20]  us
[3546.20 --> 3546.78]  from
[3546.78 --> 3546.96]  the
[3546.96 --> 3547.32]  wrath
[3547.32 --> 3547.66]  and
[3547.66 --> 3547.84]  the
[3547.84 --> 3548.16]  judgment
[3548.16 --> 3548.90]  of
[3548.90 --> 3549.32]  God
[3549.32 --> 3550.38]  against
[3550.38 --> 3550.60]  our
[3550.60 --> 3550.84]  sin.
[3552.40 --> 3552.62]  Right?
[3553.84 --> 3554.36]  Because
[3554.36 --> 3554.86]  our
[3554.86 --> 3555.26]  problem
[3555.26 --> 3555.62]  is the
[3555.62 --> 3555.84]  wrath
[3555.84 --> 3555.98]  of
[3555.98 --> 3556.16]  God
[3556.16 --> 3557.28]  only
[3557.28 --> 3557.90]  God
[3557.90 --> 3558.84]  can
[3558.84 --> 3559.16]  save
[3559.16 --> 3559.42]  us
[3559.42 --> 3559.66]  from
[3559.66 --> 3559.94]  that.
[3559.94 --> 3561.04]  That
[3561.04 --> 3561.36]  is the
[3561.36 --> 3561.80]  power
[3561.80 --> 3562.02]  of
[3562.02 --> 3562.14]  the
[3562.14 --> 3562.50]  gospel.
[3563.02 --> 3563.14]  It's
[3563.14 --> 3563.28]  the
[3563.28 --> 3563.62]  power
[3563.62 --> 3563.84]  of
[3563.84 --> 3564.14]  God.
[3564.30 --> 3564.50]  The
[3564.50 --> 3564.82]  power
[3564.82 --> 3565.00]  of
[3565.00 --> 3565.24]  God's
[3565.24 --> 3565.68]  righteousness
[3565.68 --> 3566.02]  to
[3566.02 --> 3566.24]  save
[3566.24 --> 3566.54]  us.
[3567.34 --> 3567.46]  And
[3567.46 --> 3567.72]  so
[3567.72 --> 3567.94]  the
[3567.94 --> 3568.26]  wrath
[3568.26 --> 3568.44]  of
[3568.44 --> 3568.86]  God
[3568.86 --> 3569.10]  is
[3569.10 --> 3569.42]  like
[3569.42 --> 3570.92]  a
[3570.92 --> 3571.34]  black
[3571.34 --> 3571.90]  velvet
[3571.90 --> 3572.54]  cloth
[3572.54 --> 3573.62]  upon
[3573.62 --> 3573.92]  which
[3573.92 --> 3574.14]  the
[3574.14 --> 3574.54]  brilliant
[3574.54 --> 3575.14]  diamond
[3575.14 --> 3575.96]  of
[3575.96 --> 3576.32]  God's
[3576.32 --> 3576.54]  love
[3576.54 --> 3576.70]  and
[3576.70 --> 3577.12]  salvation
[3577.12 --> 3577.34]  is
[3577.34 --> 3577.54]  most
[3577.54 --> 3577.88]  clearly
[3577.88 --> 3578.26]  seen.
[3579.48 --> 3579.98]  It's
[3579.98 --> 3580.22]  the
[3580.22 --> 3581.14]  sad
[3581.14 --> 3582.00]  truthful
[3582.00 --> 3582.46]  news
[3582.46 --> 3582.64]  of
[3582.64 --> 3582.82]  our
[3582.82 --> 3583.42]  diagnosis
[3583.42 --> 3584.12]  before
[3584.12 --> 3584.40]  the
[3584.40 --> 3584.86]  glad
[3584.86 --> 3585.56]  news
[3585.56 --> 3586.08]  of
[3586.08 --> 3586.24]  the
[3586.24 --> 3586.56]  cure.
[3587.66 --> 3588.08]  It's
[3588.08 --> 3588.36]  God's
[3588.36 --> 3588.76]  left
[3588.76 --> 3589.12]  hand
[3589.12 --> 3589.32]  of
[3589.32 --> 3589.76]  wrath
[3589.76 --> 3590.58]  chasing
[3590.58 --> 3590.88]  us
[3590.88 --> 3591.30]  into
[3591.30 --> 3592.26]  his
[3592.26 --> 3592.58]  right
[3592.58 --> 3592.88]  hand
[3592.88 --> 3593.04]  of
[3593.04 --> 3593.42]  mercy.
[3594.80 --> 3595.44]  It's
[3595.44 --> 3595.76]  like when
[3595.76 --> 3595.94]  you're
[3595.94 --> 3596.36]  out
[3596.36 --> 3596.76]  hiking
[3596.76 --> 3596.94]  and
[3596.94 --> 3597.08]  there's
[3597.08 --> 3597.22]  a
[3597.22 --> 3597.50]  terrible
[3597.50 --> 3598.10]  storm
[3598.10 --> 3599.12]  and
[3599.12 --> 3599.48]  the
[3599.48 --> 3599.86]  rain
[3599.86 --> 3600.00]  and
[3600.00 --> 3600.14]  the
[3600.14 --> 3600.42]  thunder
[3600.42 --> 3600.52]  and
[3600.52 --> 3600.62]  the
[3600.62 --> 3600.82]  lightning
[3600.82 --> 3601.06]  just
[3601.06 --> 3601.36]  coming
[3601.36 --> 3602.64]  down
[3602.64 --> 3602.96]  and
[3602.96 --> 3603.10]  you've
[3603.10 --> 3603.26]  got to
[3603.26 --> 3603.48]  find
[3603.48 --> 3604.22]  refuge.
[3606.14 --> 3607.04]  The text
[3607.04 --> 3607.56]  is helping
[3607.56 --> 3608.82]  to stir
[3608.82 --> 3609.66]  us up
[3609.66 --> 3610.66]  to take
[3610.66 --> 3611.10]  safety,
[3611.22 --> 3611.56]  to take
[3611.56 --> 3612.30]  refuge
[3612.30 --> 3613.12]  in the
[3613.12 --> 3613.50]  shelter
[3613.50 --> 3614.08]  of
[3614.08 --> 3614.36]  Jesus
[3614.36 --> 3614.96]  himself.
[3614.96 --> 3617.24]  1
[3617.24 --> 3618.04]  Thessalonians
[3618.04 --> 3618.72]  chapter 5
[3618.72 --> 3619.26]  verses 9
[3619.26 --> 3619.60]  and 10
[3619.60 --> 3620.84]  say this,
[3621.10 --> 3621.48]  For God
[3621.48 --> 3621.84]  did not
[3621.84 --> 3622.56]  appoint us
[3622.56 --> 3623.00]  to suffer
[3623.00 --> 3623.50]  wrath,
[3624.12 --> 3624.82]  but to
[3624.82 --> 3625.34]  receive
[3625.34 --> 3626.04]  salvation
[3626.04 --> 3627.36]  through
[3627.36 --> 3627.84]  our Lord
[3627.84 --> 3628.12]  Jesus
[3628.12 --> 3628.62]  Christ.
[3629.22 --> 3629.76]  He
[3629.76 --> 3630.32]  died
[3630.32 --> 3631.00]  for us
[3631.00 --> 3632.14]  so that
[3632.14 --> 3632.42]  whether
[3632.42 --> 3632.94]  we are
[3632.94 --> 3633.30]  awake
[3633.30 --> 3633.90]  or asleep,
[3634.50 --> 3635.06]  we may
[3635.06 --> 3635.52]  live
[3635.52 --> 3636.10]  together
[3636.10 --> 3636.94]  with
[3636.94 --> 3637.40]  him.
[3638.20 --> 3638.58]  Friends,
[3639.10 --> 3639.32]  God
[3639.32 --> 3639.68]  did not
[3639.68 --> 3640.08]  destine
[3640.08 --> 3640.48]  us for
[3640.48 --> 3640.86]  wrath,
[3640.96 --> 3641.22]  but for
[3641.22 --> 3641.70]  salvation
[3641.70 --> 3642.42]  through
[3642.42 --> 3642.78]  the Lord
[3642.78 --> 3643.04]  Jesus
[3643.04 --> 3643.50]  Christ.
[3644.00 --> 3644.18]  So,
[3644.26 --> 3644.34]  you know,
[3644.40 --> 3644.52]  we're
[3644.52 --> 3644.92]  about to
[3644.92 --> 3645.60]  sing a
[3645.60 --> 3645.86]  hymn,
[3645.94 --> 3646.30]  a modern
[3646.30 --> 3646.60]  hymn,
[3647.24 --> 3647.54]  called
[3647.54 --> 3647.94]  In Christ
[3647.94 --> 3648.30]  Alone,
[3649.04 --> 3650.54]  and one
[3650.54 --> 3651.08]  line that
[3651.08 --> 3651.64]  we'll sing
[3651.64 --> 3652.60]  says this,
[3653.96 --> 3654.58]  Till on
[3654.58 --> 3655.38]  that cross
[3655.38 --> 3656.20]  as Jesus
[3656.20 --> 3656.68]  died,
[3657.42 --> 3658.00]  the wrath
[3658.00 --> 3658.56]  of God
[3658.56 --> 3659.96]  was satisfied.
[3660.62 --> 3661.20]  For every
[3661.20 --> 3662.08]  sin on
[3662.08 --> 3662.64]  him,
[3663.66 --> 3663.92]  Jesus
[3663.92 --> 3664.78]  was laid.
[3665.38 --> 3666.06]  Here in
[3666.06 --> 3666.56]  the death
[3666.56 --> 3667.40]  of Christ
[3667.40 --> 3668.44]  I
[3668.44 --> 3669.56]  live.
[3671.36 --> 3672.20]  On the
[3672.20 --> 3672.66]  cross,
[3673.50 --> 3674.34]  God's
[3674.34 --> 3675.56]  righteous
[3675.56 --> 3676.34]  wrath
[3676.34 --> 3676.88]  against
[3676.88 --> 3677.48]  our
[3677.48 --> 3677.94]  sin
[3677.94 --> 3679.58]  was not
[3679.58 --> 3680.04]  poured out
[3680.04 --> 3680.66]  on us,
[3680.72 --> 3680.90]  it was
[3680.90 --> 3681.26]  poured out
[3681.26 --> 3681.76]  on Jesus.
[3682.84 --> 3683.64]  So that
[3683.64 --> 3684.22]  through faith
[3684.22 --> 3684.84]  in him,
[3685.54 --> 3685.92]  God's
[3685.92 --> 3686.54]  life,
[3686.90 --> 3687.60]  his love,
[3688.04 --> 3688.66]  his grace,
[3688.78 --> 3689.36]  his mercy
[3689.36 --> 3690.00]  could be
[3690.00 --> 3690.40]  poured out
[3690.40 --> 3690.94]  on us.
[3692.18 --> 3692.70]  Thanks be
[3692.70 --> 3693.06]  to God.
[3693.68 --> 3694.12]  Let's pray
[3694.12 --> 3694.44]  together.
[3697.64 --> 3698.24]  Lord,
[3698.34 --> 3699.64]  we just
[3699.64 --> 3700.18]  humbly
[3700.18 --> 3701.62]  bow
[3701.62 --> 3703.00]  before you,
[3703.68 --> 3704.20]  before this
[3704.20 --> 3704.80]  passage,
[3705.54 --> 3706.58]  which comes
[3706.58 --> 3707.60]  with such
[3707.60 --> 3708.46]  thunderous
[3708.46 --> 3709.50]  voice,
[3710.80 --> 3711.34]  accusing
[3711.34 --> 3712.14]  each one
[3712.14 --> 3712.50]  of us,
[3712.58 --> 3712.90]  accusing
[3712.90 --> 3713.44]  the whole
[3713.44 --> 3713.90]  world,
[3714.06 --> 3714.46]  all of
[3714.46 --> 3715.04]  humanity,
[3716.18 --> 3716.50]  laying
[3716.50 --> 3717.12]  bare
[3717.12 --> 3718.64]  that we
[3718.64 --> 3719.28]  are sinners
[3719.28 --> 3719.82]  and that we
[3719.82 --> 3720.36]  need a
[3720.36 --> 3720.64]  savior.
[3720.64 --> 3720.72]  savior.
[3721.60 --> 3722.14]  And yet,
[3722.24 --> 3722.72]  we can
[3722.72 --> 3723.68]  also rise
[3723.68 --> 3724.08]  and lift
[3724.08 --> 3724.48]  up our
[3724.48 --> 3725.52]  voices and
[3725.52 --> 3726.68]  sing about
[3726.68 --> 3727.24]  the God
[3727.24 --> 3728.16]  who saves
[3728.16 --> 3730.12]  because this
[3730.12 --> 3731.24]  passage teaches
[3731.24 --> 3731.84]  us that we
[3731.84 --> 3732.62]  have a savior,
[3733.28 --> 3734.00]  our Lord Jesus
[3734.00 --> 3734.48]  Christ.
[3736.10 --> 3736.32]  And so,
[3736.40 --> 3736.48]  Lord,
[3736.54 --> 3737.20]  we praise you.
[3737.54 --> 3738.34]  Give us voices
[3738.34 --> 3739.42]  as we sing.
[3740.20 --> 3740.88]  We pray
[3740.88 --> 3742.00]  through Christ.
[3742.70 --> 3742.96]  Amen.
[3742.96 --> 3746.08]  And so,
[3746.22 --> 3746.62]  let's stand
[3746.62 --> 3747.36]  and let's
[3747.36 --> 3748.52]  sing to God.
[3748.52 --> 3748.58]  Amen.
[3748.58 --> 3769.04]  In Christ alone
[3769.04 --> 3771.92]  my hope is found,
[3772.40 --> 3773.64]  he is my light,
[3773.74 --> 3775.30]  my strength,
[3775.44 --> 3776.40]  my soul,
[3776.40 --> 3779.34]  His cornerstone,
[3779.74 --> 3782.16]  His solid ground,
[3782.64 --> 3783.48]  from through the
[3783.48 --> 3783.88]  fields,
[3784.00 --> 3786.68]  this drought and storm.
[3787.24 --> 3789.42]  What heights of love,
[3789.88 --> 3792.10]  what depths of peace,
[3792.46 --> 3794.46]  when fears are still,
[3794.84 --> 3795.90]  when straying
[3795.90 --> 3797.06]  sings,
[3797.52 --> 3798.88]  my comfort,
[3800.06 --> 3802.48]  my all in all,
[3802.48 --> 3805.48]  healing the love of Christ,
[3805.48 --> 3807.00]  the Son.
[3817.10 --> 3818.96]  In Christ alone
[3818.96 --> 3821.96]  who took on flesh,
[3822.90 --> 3824.34]  fullness of God,
[3824.46 --> 3827.20]  and helpless babe,
[3827.60 --> 3829.68]  this gift of love,
[3830.00 --> 3831.34]  and righteousness,
[3831.34 --> 3834.20]  torn by the ones
[3834.20 --> 3837.04]  he came to save.
[3837.44 --> 3839.70]  Till on the cross
[3839.70 --> 3842.12]  of Jesus' side,
[3842.52 --> 3844.82]  the wrath of God
[3844.82 --> 3846.32]  was satisfied.
[3847.54 --> 3849.70]  For every sin
[3849.70 --> 3852.32]  on him was laid,
[3852.82 --> 3854.16]  here in the death
[3854.16 --> 3857.04]  of Christ I live.
[3857.04 --> 3869.72]  in the ground
[3869.72 --> 3872.56]  his body lay,
[3872.56 --> 3874.18]  light of the world
[3874.18 --> 3876.56]  my darkness slain,
[3877.56 --> 3879.76]  then burst and cold
[3879.76 --> 3882.56]  in glorious air,
[3882.56 --> 3884.26]  up from the grave
[3884.26 --> 3887.12]  he rose again.
[3887.60 --> 3889.08]  And as he stands
[3889.08 --> 3891.58]  in victory,
[3892.48 --> 3894.08]  sin's curse has lost,
[3894.92 --> 3896.08]  skins free upon me,
[3896.08 --> 3899.08]  for I am his,
[3899.76 --> 3902.24]  and he is mine,
[3902.66 --> 3904.08]  wrong with the precious
[3904.08 --> 3907.08]  blood of Christ.
[3907.08 --> 3919.36]  No guilt in life,
[3919.36 --> 3922.04]  no fear in death,
[3922.04 --> 3923.76]  this is the power
[3923.76 --> 3926.54]  of Christ in me.
[3926.76 --> 3928.92]  From Christ's cry
[3928.92 --> 3931.82]  to final breath,
[3931.82 --> 3935.62]  Jesus commands my destiny.
[3936.74 --> 3938.78]  No power of hell,
[3939.20 --> 3941.34]  no scheme of man,
[3941.64 --> 3944.38]  can ever block me
[3944.38 --> 3946.06]  from his hand.
[3946.46 --> 3948.60]  Till he returns,
[3948.96 --> 3951.22]  or calls me home,
[3951.68 --> 3954.58]  he in the power of Christ
[3954.58 --> 3955.84]  will stand.
[3955.84 --> 3962.54]  You may be seated.
[3972.54 --> 3974.16]  So we'll continue our worship
[3974.16 --> 3975.74]  this morning by responding
[3975.74 --> 3976.72]  to who God is,
[3976.78 --> 3977.96]  his mercy for us,
[3978.38 --> 3979.82]  not only in song,
[3980.00 --> 3980.86]  as we just did,
[3980.98 --> 3982.62]  but also in giving
[3982.62 --> 3984.68]  to the work of his kingdom.
[3984.68 --> 3987.56]  And so if you are
[3987.56 --> 3988.96]  visiting with us today,
[3989.08 --> 3989.60]  please don't feel
[3989.60 --> 3991.04]  obligated to give,
[3991.30 --> 3992.40]  but we'll have the deacons
[3992.40 --> 3993.04]  come around
[3993.04 --> 3995.34]  and pass the offering baskets
[3995.34 --> 3996.90]  and give as you are led.
[3998.40 --> 4000.14]  Our designated offering
[4000.14 --> 4000.66]  this morning
[4000.66 --> 4002.42]  is for King's University.
[4002.66 --> 4004.38]  It's our Christian school
[4004.38 --> 4005.32]  in Edmonton.
[4006.10 --> 4008.10]  And so they,
[4008.68 --> 4010.12]  I think,
[4010.16 --> 4010.96]  no longer receive
[4010.96 --> 4012.02]  denominational support.
[4012.30 --> 4014.18]  And so they do really rely
[4014.18 --> 4015.22]  on a good portion
[4015.22 --> 4017.82]  of their needs,
[4017.86 --> 4018.32]  their budget,
[4018.54 --> 4020.40]  from the churches.
[4020.82 --> 4022.32]  And so let's give to that.
[4022.32 --> 4024.24]  wir wanting this morning
[4024.24 --> 4026.00]  to see the young customers
[4026.00 --> 4026.66]  at once we get out
[4026.66 --> 4027.54]  of their happiest
[4027.54 --> 4028.32]  and they will die.
[4028.48 --> 4029.76]  So they think
[4029.76 --> 4031.10]  they can T're gonna wear
[4031.10 --> 4032.48]  because they have
[4032.48 --> 4033.38]  the hands of the side
[4033.38 --> 4033.88]  and they can smell
[4033.88 --> 4034.88]  this morning.
[4034.88 --> 4035.66]  And so could you
[4035.66 --> 4036.24]  sort
[4036.24 --> 4036.64]  that even
[4036.64 --> 4036.92]  they can
[4036.92 --> 4037.52]  any
[4037.52 --> 4039.06]  Dannbox
[4039.06 --> 4069.04]  Thank you.
[4069.06 --> 4099.04]  Thank you.
[4099.06 --> 4129.04]  Thank you.
[4129.06 --> 4159.04]  Thank you.
[4159.06 --> 4189.04]  Thank you.
[4189.06 --> 4219.04]  Thank you.
[4219.04 --> 4224.54]  So let's come to the Lord in prayer for the world, for our church.
[4225.04 --> 4226.36]  I want to pray for a couple things.
[4226.36 --> 4232.02]  One, I want to give thanks for the offering, for God's generosity to us.
[4232.48 --> 4235.54]  Pray for a few needs of people in our church as well.
[4235.54 --> 4244.84]  And also then I want to use this prayer in our lift up your hearts hymnal about, well, praying
[4244.84 --> 4246.98]  for truth and reconciliation.
[4247.54 --> 4254.42]  A prayer for indigenous peoples, refugees, immigrants, and pilgrims, because as we know, tomorrow
[4254.42 --> 4256.40]  is truth and reconciliation day.
[4256.40 --> 4261.86]  So please join me in prayer as we bring these things before the Lord.
[4265.12 --> 4269.08]  So Lord, we praise you, Lord.
[4269.08 --> 4273.98]  We praise you for your great generosity to us in the gospel.
[4273.98 --> 4282.52]  Lord, we love the idea of generosity, but sometimes it's really hard to enact it.
[4282.52 --> 4295.32]  So thank you, Lord, for your grace and your grace, which can override our tendency to protect and just protect what we have.
[4295.32 --> 4305.74]  Most of all, thank you for your son, Jesus Christ, who freely gave himself up to bring us into your family.
[4306.60 --> 4309.32]  And more than that, to make us heirs along with himself.
[4310.06 --> 4318.42]  Would you multiply, Lord, these small gifts that we have offered to you and use them abundantly to grow your kingdom for your glory in the world.
[4318.42 --> 4323.54]  We especially, Lord, pray for King's University through, Lord, their work.
[4323.64 --> 4331.70]  Would you cause the students of that university, most of all, Lord, to come to know you, the living God.
[4332.50 --> 4339.70]  And then, Lord, would you equip them to be your servants in this world that you have made, that they would glorify you,
[4340.10 --> 4343.60]  and that they would give thanks to you in all things.
[4344.50 --> 4348.06]  Lord, we lift up some of the needs of our own congregation.
[4348.06 --> 4352.84]  Lord, we think, especially this morning, of Henny and Grace, who are in Delta Hospital.
[4353.62 --> 4358.32]  Lord, would you be with them while they are there, away from their home.
[4358.40 --> 4359.30]  Would you comfort them?
[4359.96 --> 4373.40]  Would you be present with them, especially, Lord, in a time of where we just feel even a greater need for you than we often do feel in our everyday lives.
[4373.40 --> 4387.42]  Lord, we also lift up to you, Arlene, the niece of Joe, of Joe Schulk, who suddenly yesterday, Lord, took a, had a serious medical emergency and is in the hospital.
[4387.62 --> 4393.18]  And, Lord, as Joe says, it's, it doesn't seem to be a very good situation.
[4393.18 --> 4402.46]  And so, Lord, we pray for your power and your presence to be made known, Lord, to this niece and also to her family around her.
[4403.38 --> 4404.84]  Lord, would you heal her?
[4405.08 --> 4406.20]  Would you work through the doctors?
[4407.42 --> 4410.56]  And would you miraculously do what you are able to do?
[4410.56 --> 4414.36]  And, Lord, we look to you for all things.
[4414.88 --> 4416.74]  Lord, would you bring healing in that situation?
[4418.70 --> 4425.70]  And, Lord, we now turn to pray in light of Truth and Reconciliation Day tomorrow.
[4425.70 --> 4453.80]  And so, Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we come before you as many parts of a single body, people drawn from every tribe, every nation, every language, some indigenous peoples of the land, some refugees and immigrants and pilgrims, people on the move, some hosts, some guests, some both hosts and guests.
[4453.80 --> 4457.52]  All of us searching for an eternal place where we can belong.
[4458.76 --> 4460.34]  Creator, forgive us.
[4461.20 --> 4463.58]  The earth is yours and everything that is in it.
[4464.16 --> 4465.00]  But we forget.
[4466.26 --> 4469.12]  In our arrogance, we think we own it.
[4470.06 --> 4473.34]  In our greed, we think we can steal it.
[4474.38 --> 4477.48]  In our ignorance, we worship it.
[4478.30 --> 4480.64]  In our thoughtlessness, we destroy it.
[4480.64 --> 4485.54]  In our hearts, we forget that you created it to bring praise and joy to you.
[4486.18 --> 4490.84]  That you gave it as a gift for us to steward and for us to enjoy.
[4491.52 --> 4495.02]  For us to see more clearly your beauty and your majesty.
[4496.60 --> 4498.10]  Jesus, save us.
[4499.10 --> 4500.50]  We wait for your kingdom.
[4501.46 --> 4503.56]  We long for your throne.
[4503.56 --> 4507.44]  We hunger for your reconciliation.
[4507.44 --> 4515.20]  For that day when people from every tribe and every tongue will gather around you and sing your praises.
[4516.04 --> 4518.94]  Holy Spirit, teach us.
[4520.12 --> 4524.12]  Help us to remember that the body is made up of many parts.
[4524.90 --> 4526.14]  Each one unique.
[4526.94 --> 4528.54]  And every one necessary.
[4528.54 --> 4534.56]  Teach us to embrace the discomfort that comes from diversity.
[4535.46 --> 4543.26]  And to celebrate the fact that we are unified, not through our sameness, but through the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4544.34 --> 4545.94]  Triune God, we love you.
[4546.72 --> 4548.04]  Your creation is beautiful.
[4548.24 --> 4549.86]  Your salvation is merciful.
[4550.48 --> 4552.32]  And your wisdom is beyond compare.
[4553.12 --> 4557.20]  We pray this all in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[4557.20 --> 4558.46]  Amen.
[4561.16 --> 4567.28]  All right, let's stand and we prepare to go out into our week with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4567.80 --> 4573.96]  Right after the service, I invite you to stay for a time of fellowship and coffee right through the doors in our fellowship hall.
[4574.66 --> 4577.50]  Now I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4578.24 --> 4580.42]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4581.04 --> 4584.48]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4584.48 --> 4588.38]  The Lord lift up his face upon you and give you peace.
[4588.90 --> 4589.36]  Amen.
[4589.36 --> 4589.42]  Amen.
[4589.42 --> 4608.98]  Singing together.
[4608.98 --> 4609.48]  Hallelujah.
[4609.58 --> 4610.78]  Hallelujah.
[4611.86 --> 4612.58]  Hallelujah.
[4613.28 --> 4613.74]  Hallelujah.
[4618.78 --> 4623.40]  For the Lord God Almighty will be.
[4625.76 --> 4636.74]  Hallelujah.
[4636.74 --> 4640.58]  Holy Lord, what a mighty praise
[4640.58 --> 4644.74]  Hallelujah
[4644.74 --> 4649.74]  Holy
[4649.74 --> 4653.74]  Holy
[4653.74 --> 4660.14]  Are you Lord, what a mighty
[4660.14 --> 4665.20]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4665.20 --> 4668.14]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4668.14 --> 4670.76]  You are holy
[4670.76 --> 4673.94]  Holy
[4673.94 --> 4680.64]  Are you Lord, what a mighty
[4680.64 --> 4685.14]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4685.14 --> 4688.54]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4688.54 --> 4691.24]  You are holy
[4691.24 --> 4696.80]  Holy
[4696.80 --> 4702.98]  Are you Lord, what a mighty
[4702.98 --> 4706.30]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4706.30 --> 4709.04]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4709.04 --> 4711.80]  You are holy
[4711.80 --> 4717.36]  Holy
[4717.36 --> 4721.54]  Are you Lord, what a mighty
[4721.54 --> 4726.36]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4726.36 --> 4729.70]  Worthy is the Lamb
[4729.70 --> 4731.36]  Amen
[4731.36 --> 4743.16]  Amen
[4743.16 --> 4773.14]  Thank you.
[4773.16 --> 4803.14]  Thank you.
[4803.16 --> 4833.14]  Thank you.
