[541.70 --> 553.70]  the author of this prayer is David it's Psalm 8 and I'd ask you to join with me in a responsive manner for this prayer of adoration and unusually you get to begin
[553.70 --> 570.32]  Lord our Lord how majestic is your name in all the earth you have set your glory in the heavens through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger.
[570.32 --> 578.36]  You have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger.
[579.38 --> 585.80]  When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place,
[586.36 --> 589.12]  what is mankind that you are mindful of us?
[589.22 --> 590.52]  Oh, I changed a few pronouns.
[591.00 --> 593.82]  The human beings that you care for us.
[594.72 --> 602.10]  You have made us a little lower than the angels and crowned us with glory and honor.
[603.00 --> 606.86]  You made us rulers over the works of your hands.
[607.46 --> 610.18]  You put everything under our feet.
[611.10 --> 617.50]  All flocks and herds and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea,
[617.88 --> 620.56]  all that swim the paths of the sea.
[620.56 --> 627.36]  Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[629.16 --> 631.76]  Lord's greeting in return comes to us.
[631.84 --> 632.98]  It's actually more of a command.
[633.12 --> 634.68]  It's from Psalm 46.
[634.68 --> 649.60]  If you are able, please stand and greet the people around you,
[649.60 --> 666.60]  and we will sing our first songs of praise led by the Gems Group this morning.
[666.60 --> 696.58]  Thank you.
[696.60 --> 701.30]  Thank you.
[701.30 --> 727.30]  Hear the word of God the Father, from before the world began,
[727.30 --> 735.40]  Every store and every planet has been fashioned by your hand.
[735.82 --> 743.22]  All creation holds together by the power of your voice,
[743.54 --> 750.30]  Let the skies declare your glory, let the land and seas rejoice.
[750.30 --> 758.00]  Through the offer of creation, you are the Lord of everyone,
[758.92 --> 764.76]  And your cry of love brings out across the land.
[764.76 --> 778.16]  And you left the gaze of angels, came to seek and save the lost,
[778.58 --> 785.88]  And exchanged the joy of heaven for the anguish of the cross.
[785.88 --> 793.68]  When the prayer you fed the hungry, when the word you calmed the sea,
[794.06 --> 801.04]  Yet how silent do you suffer, that the guilty may go free.
[801.72 --> 808.22]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone,
[808.22 --> 815.10]  And your cry of love brings out across the land.
[820.54 --> 828.46]  With a shout you rose victorious, and I've seen victory from the grave,
[828.46 --> 836.14]  And you've slingered into heaven, leading captives in your way.
[836.14 --> 843.76]  Now you stand before the Father, interceding for your own.
[843.76 --> 851.52]  From each side with a tall nation, you are leading sinners' song.
[851.94 --> 858.52]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone,
[859.66 --> 865.26]  And your cry of love brings out across the land.
[865.26 --> 868.74]  You're the one who made the heavens, made my heart and soul,
[868.96 --> 872.88]  And your grant God Heil and Easter.
[872.88 --> 892.58]  The Lord who made the heavens
[892.58 --> 895.66]  Made my heart and soul
[895.66 --> 898.64]  Before I drew a breath
[898.64 --> 901.66]  I was loved and known
[901.66 --> 904.84]  I am His creation
[904.84 --> 907.42]  The Maker's masterpiece
[907.42 --> 911.18]  And all that He designs
[911.18 --> 914.32]  Will be done in me
[914.32 --> 918.54]  I belong to the Lord
[918.54 --> 921.28]  Oh, I am not my own
[921.28 --> 924.44]  I belong to the Lord
[924.44 --> 927.42]  I am not my own
[927.42 --> 930.42]  I will honor Him
[930.42 --> 933.36]  For this I know
[933.36 --> 936.42]  I belong to the Lord
[936.42 --> 940.10]  I am not my own
[940.10 --> 944.86]  God, He is the temple
[944.86 --> 948.24]  Of the living God
[948.24 --> 951.26]  I'll worship in this house
[951.26 --> 954.48]  That His blood has brought
[954.48 --> 957.80]  As I bear His image
[957.80 --> 960.58]  Or may I not refrain
[960.58 --> 963.70]  The holiness I hold
[963.70 --> 967.10]  In this earthly thing
[967.10 --> 971.78]  If He has redeemed me
[971.78 --> 974.86]  I am not my own
[974.86 --> 977.86]  The measure of my words
[977.86 --> 980.86]  Is His love alone
[980.86 --> 983.86]  He declares my standing
[983.86 --> 987.14]  As He declares my state
[987.14 --> 990.10]  So I will know myself
[990.10 --> 993.32]  By the name He came
[993.32 --> 997.84]  I belong to the Lord
[997.84 --> 1000.66]  Oh, I am not my own
[1000.66 --> 1003.84]  I belong to the Lord
[1003.84 --> 1006.76]  I am not my own
[1006.76 --> 1009.88]  I will honor Him
[1009.88 --> 1012.98]  For this I know
[1012.98 --> 1016.10]  I belong to the Lord
[1016.10 --> 1020.22]  I am not my own
[1020.22 --> 1020.62]  I am not my own
[1020.62 --> 1024.62]  I am not my own
[1024.62 --> 1026.94]  At this point we are going to have a litany
[1026.94 --> 1028.42]  with the girls
[1028.42 --> 1030.54]  and we would like you to join where it says all.
[1030.98 --> 1031.44]  Thank you.
[1031.44 --> 1031.50]  Thank you.
[1046.10 --> 1067.32]  There is nothing easy about being a girl
[1067.32 --> 1068.76]  or living in our world today
[1068.76 --> 1070.54]  We face unique challenges
[1070.54 --> 1072.00]  and unsustainable pressures
[1072.00 --> 1073.28]  in a culture of confusion
[1073.28 --> 1074.26]  about who God is
[1074.26 --> 1075.66]  and what is truth
[1075.66 --> 1078.36]  Sometimes it can feel overwhelming and hopeless
[1078.36 --> 1080.28]  but we gather on this Gem Sunday
[1080.28 --> 1081.88]  in the hope of Jesus Christ
[1081.88 --> 1085.26]  Placing our hope in God
[1085.26 --> 1086.70]  changes everything
[1086.70 --> 1090.22]  Those who hope in the Lord
[1090.22 --> 1092.02]  will renew their strength
[1092.02 --> 1095.36]  They will soar on wings like eagles
[1095.36 --> 1098.38]  They will run and not be weary
[1098.38 --> 1101.68]  They will walk and not be faint
[1101.68 --> 1104.62]  To put our hope in God
[1104.62 --> 1105.62]  we need to know Him
[1105.62 --> 1107.10]  At Gems the girls learn
[1107.10 --> 1108.26]  these five truths
[1108.26 --> 1109.32]  about who God is
[1109.32 --> 1110.46]  and what He has promised
[1110.46 --> 1113.06]  God is King
[1113.06 --> 1117.00]  For the Lord Most High is awesome
[1117.00 --> 1120.20]  The great King over all the earth
[1120.20 --> 1124.00]  God is our Deliverer
[1124.00 --> 1126.40]  The Lord is my rock
[1126.40 --> 1127.52]  My fortress
[1127.52 --> 1128.94]  And my deliverer
[1128.94 --> 1131.56]  My God is my rock
[1131.56 --> 1133.58]  In whom I take refuge
[1133.58 --> 1135.32]  I shield
[1135.32 --> 1136.32]  And the horn
[1136.32 --> 1137.74]  Of my salvation
[1137.74 --> 1139.48]  My stronghold
[1139.48 --> 1142.12]  God is trustworthy
[1142.12 --> 1145.14]  He is who He says He is
[1145.14 --> 1146.88]  And He will do
[1146.88 --> 1149.00]  What He says He will do
[1149.00 --> 1151.94]  For it is our truth
[1151.94 --> 1153.94]  In all He promises
[1153.94 --> 1155.44]  And He is faithful
[1155.44 --> 1157.12]  In all He does
[1157.12 --> 1160.38]  God is always at work
[1160.38 --> 1161.72]  He is near
[1161.72 --> 1164.32]  The Lord is near
[1164.32 --> 1166.32]  To all who call on Him
[1166.32 --> 1169.00]  To all who call on Him
[1169.00 --> 1169.82]  In truth
[1169.82 --> 1172.36]  God is with you
[1172.36 --> 1173.70]  Wherever you go
[1173.70 --> 1176.72]  Do not be afraid
[1176.72 --> 1178.90]  Do not be discouraged
[1178.90 --> 1181.00]  For the Lord your God
[1181.00 --> 1182.30]  will be with you
[1182.30 --> 1183.96]  Wherever you go
[1183.96 --> 1187.32]  Thanks be to the God of hope
[1187.32 --> 1188.56]  who renews our strength
[1188.56 --> 1189.60]  so that we can rise up
[1189.60 --> 1190.58]  in every circumstance
[1190.58 --> 1192.36]  stand secure in our faith
[1192.36 --> 1193.28]  and have the confidence
[1193.28 --> 1194.84]  that when we put our hope in Him
[1194.84 --> 1195.74]  we will be okay
[1195.74 --> 1197.14]  no matter what
[1206.72 --> 1226.04]  He has shown thee
[1226.04 --> 1227.54]  He has shown thee
[1227.54 --> 1228.90]  O good

[1232.98 --> 1234.72]  Reckards of thee
[1234.72 --> 1237.56]  He has shown thee
[1237.56 --> 1239.00]  He has shown thee
[1239.00 --> 1240.40]  O good
[1240.40 --> 1241.62]  O man
[1241.62 --> 1243.10]  What is good
[1243.10 --> 1244.50]  And what the Lord
[1244.50 --> 1246.54]  Reckards of thee
[1246.54 --> 1249.10]  What to do justly
[1249.10 --> 1250.50]  What to do justly

[1251.90 --> 1253.34]  And to love mercy
[1253.34 --> 1255.34]  And to walk humbly

[1301.92 --> 1303.18]  show you
[1303.18 --> 1303.44]  Thank you
[1303.44 --> 1303.86]  In the很 nära
[1303.86 --> 1304.98]  Is here
[1304.98 --> 1305.30]  heck
[1305.30 --> 1330.82]  Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord.
[1330.82 --> 1335.46]  Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
[1335.94 --> 1340.24]  If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[1340.68 --> 1346.02]  But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can with reverence serve you.
[1346.74 --> 1354.06]  I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
[1354.06 --> 1361.82]  I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning.
[1362.76 --> 1374.24]  Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption.
[1374.78 --> 1377.92]  He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[1377.92 --> 1383.18]  My heart is not proud, Lord. My eyes are not haughty.
[1383.82 --> 1389.04]  I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.
[1389.38 --> 1393.46]  I have calmed and quiet in myself. I am like a weaned child with its mother.
[1394.04 --> 1395.60]  Like a weaned child, I am content.
[1396.14 --> 1399.42]  Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forevermore.
[1399.42 --> 1399.52]  Amen.
[1407.92 --> 1418.62]  Well, as you can see, we have a large and active GEMS group this year,
[1418.76 --> 1421.54]  and we'll see them again leading some singing,
[1421.84 --> 1424.46]  and they'll be helping to collect the offering later on,
[1424.50 --> 1427.06]  and in various other ways help us this morning.
[1427.20 --> 1428.58]  It's kind of fun to watch.
[1432.08 --> 1434.30]  In our time of confession now,
[1436.30 --> 1437.26]  confession of what?
[1437.92 --> 1440.38]  Well, sin.
[1441.62 --> 1442.66]  Sins, actually.
[1444.00 --> 1445.12]  What is sin?
[1447.88 --> 1456.42]  Are some of our sins and wrongs that we commit more important or significant than other sins?
[1456.82 --> 1461.74]  What are we confessing this morning when we go through a period of confession and assurance?
[1461.74 --> 1471.88]  Imagine for a moment that you were Jesus in about A.D. 30, Anno Domini, the year of our Lord.
[1471.98 --> 1472.98]  We don't say that anymore.
[1473.14 --> 1475.52]  We say 30 CE, current era.
[1475.80 --> 1478.90]  We've generified our dates.
[1479.48 --> 1480.40]  Imagine you were Jesus.
[1480.48 --> 1481.00]  It's difficult.
[1481.00 --> 1482.00]  You can't really do that.
[1482.00 --> 1498.34]  You're in a position of trying to teach what is sin and what is right in a theocratic government that thinks it knows exactly what's right and wrong.
[1498.34 --> 1503.08]  And how to deal with it.
[1503.08 --> 1504.54]  They wrote a rule book.
[1504.54 --> 1514.28]  Over here, there's a woman caught in the act of adultery, and the crowd is immediately planning to stone her.
[1514.28 --> 1522.48]  No trial, kill her on the spot, because after all, she was caught in the act of adultery.
[1522.84 --> 1531.20]  No word on the man involved, but it has the same penalty as if she had murdered someone.
[1531.20 --> 1539.92]  Over here, a man picked up his bed and walked off of it on the Sabbath day.
[1540.50 --> 1541.34]  Clearly wrong.
[1544.24 --> 1554.24]  Or the disciples were wandering through a field and eating the heads off the grain that morning, but it was the Sabbath, and that's clearly wrong.
[1555.66 --> 1557.04]  They have a rule book.
[1557.04 --> 1570.80]  You can't murder, but it's perfectly okay to intensely hate the Roman rulers that are dealing with you on a daily basis, but that's not in the rule book.
[1573.02 --> 1585.52]  If I see a common theme in the early New Testament, it's that the accusers are very good at finding sins in other people.
[1587.04 --> 1596.18]  Sometimes we, too, are better attuned to see the shortcomings and mistakes of others more clearly than our own.
[1596.18 --> 1608.14]  But Jesus said, how can you say to your brother, brother, let me take the speck out of your eye when you fail to see the plank in your own eye?
[1608.54 --> 1609.82]  You hypocrite.
[1610.40 --> 1617.44]  First take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see more clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
[1617.44 --> 1626.94]  Indeed, Paul reminds us in Romans, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[1628.94 --> 1639.00]  So it's not others who have sinned or them, but us, me.
[1639.00 --> 1642.96]  And that's what we're confessing this morning.
[1646.78 --> 1652.92]  But our assurance of pardon is a very familiar one, and it's in John 3, 16.
[1652.92 --> 1663.40]  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[1664.34 --> 1671.54]  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
[1672.30 --> 1674.32]  And for this we give thanks to God.
[1674.32 --> 1678.38]  Let's sing a song of response.
[1678.78 --> 1681.86]  The ladies will come up and sing His Mercy is More.
[1681.86 --> 1706.46]  More than 50 compared to 100, 16.
[1706.46 --> 1711.22]  Brown into a sea with self-love and more sure
[1711.22 --> 1717.08]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1717.08 --> 1728.58]  But patience would wait as we constantly roam
[1728.58 --> 1733.26]  What Father so tender is calling us home
[1733.26 --> 1738.44]  He welcomes the weakest, the weakest, the poor
[1738.44 --> 1743.98]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1743.98 --> 1750.90]  His mercy is more
[1750.90 --> 1757.98]  Stronger the darkness, new every more
[1757.98 --> 1762.94]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1762.94 --> 1774.82]  But riches of kindness He lavished on us
[1774.82 --> 1779.62]  His blood was the payment, His life was the cost
[1779.62 --> 1784.90]  We stood near a debt we could never afford
[1784.90 --> 1790.08]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1790.08 --> 1790.58]  But patience would wait as we continue to do
[1790.58 --> 1795.76]  Because the Lord, His mercy is more
[1795.76 --> 1797.26]  His mercy is more
[1797.26 --> 1803.46]  Stronger the darkness, new every more
[1803.46 --> 1809.26]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1809.26 --> 1814.44]  His mercy is more
[1814.44 --> 1818.44]  His mercy is more
[1818.44 --> 1821.14]  Stronger the darkness, new every more
[1821.14 --> 1826.14]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[1826.14 --> 1842.02]  His mercy is more
[1842.02 --> 1846.02]  So at this time we will invite the children to go to their Sunday School classes.
[1846.02 --> 1850.96]  I understand that the gems are staying here
[1850.96 --> 1853.90]  Thank you gems
[1853.90 --> 1868.50]  So good morning
[1868.50 --> 1870.22]  It's good to be with you
[1870.22 --> 1873.36]  So as John mentioned earlier
[1873.36 --> 1878.06]  We have been in an Easter sermon series
[1878.06 --> 1881.32]  That we're calling Resurrection Presence
[1881.32 --> 1883.90]  And we've been looking at some of the interactions
[1883.90 --> 1886.80]  That Jesus has with His disciples
[1886.80 --> 1889.62]  After He was risen from the dead
[1889.62 --> 1894.64]  And how Jesus comes to them with His resurrection life
[1894.64 --> 1899.00]  And how He restores them in some various ways
[1899.00 --> 1903.68]  And today we come to John chapter 21
[1903.68 --> 1909.14]  Where we have this very beautiful and very intimate interaction
[1909.14 --> 1911.66]  Between Jesus and Peter
[1911.66 --> 1915.74]  And we see how Jesus draws near to Peter
[1915.74 --> 1917.30]  In his failure
[1917.30 --> 1919.98]  And then restores Peter
[1919.98 --> 1921.86]  To fellowship with him
[1921.86 --> 1924.06]  And to faithfulness
[1924.06 --> 1927.00]  And so let's open our Bibles this morning
[1927.00 --> 1929.10]  To John chapter 21
[1929.10 --> 1933.20]  We've been in John 21 for the last couple weeks
[1933.20 --> 1935.88]  And we'll be in it next week as well
[1935.88 --> 1944.52]  So this is on page 809
[1944.52 --> 1946.50]  In the Pew Bible in front of you
[1946.50 --> 1947.50]  If you'd like to turn there
[1947.50 --> 1949.74]  Page 809
[1949.74 --> 1953.84]  Our passage today is quite short
[1953.84 --> 1958.88]  We'll just read verses 15-17
[1958.88 --> 1961.28]  So chapter 21
[1961.28 --> 1964.38]  Beginning in verse 15
[1964.38 --> 1968.48]  When they had finished eating
[1968.48 --> 1971.20]  Jesus said to Simon Peter
[1971.20 --> 1973.94]  Simon, son of John
[1973.94 --> 1976.90]  Do you truly love me more than these?
[1977.90 --> 1979.02]  Yes, Lord, he said
[1979.02 --> 1980.40]  You know that I love you
[1980.40 --> 1982.42]  Jesus said
[1982.42 --> 1984.10]  Feed my lambs
[1984.10 --> 1986.64]  Again, Jesus said
[1986.64 --> 1987.86]  Simon, son of John
[1987.86 --> 1989.12]  Do you truly love me?
[1989.84 --> 1990.68]  He answered
[1990.68 --> 1992.94]  Yes, Lord, you know that I love you
[1992.94 --> 1994.98]  Jesus said
[1994.98 --> 1996.46]  Take care of my sheep
[1996.46 --> 1999.32]  The third time
[1999.32 --> 2000.24]  He said to him
[2000.24 --> 2002.26]  Simon, son of John
[2002.26 --> 2004.12]  Do you love me?
[2005.46 --> 2006.66]  Peter was hurt
[2006.66 --> 2008.52]  Because Jesus asked him
[2008.52 --> 2009.46]  The third time
[2009.46 --> 2010.24]  Do you love me?
[2010.98 --> 2011.38]  He said
[2011.38 --> 2012.94]  Lord, you know all things
[2012.94 --> 2014.80]  You know that I love you
[2014.80 --> 2016.54]  Jesus said
[2016.54 --> 2018.32]  Feed my sheep
[2018.32 --> 2020.14]  This is the word of the Lord
[2020.14 --> 2024.00]  So please join me
[2024.00 --> 2024.68]  In prayer
[2024.68 --> 2026.46]  As we pray for God's blessing
[2026.46 --> 2027.28]  Upon the reading
[2027.28 --> 2027.98]  And the preaching
[2027.98 --> 2029.20]  Of his word this morning
[2029.20 --> 2029.70]  Let's pray
[2029.70 --> 2031.74]  Our Father, we thank you
[2031.74 --> 2032.28]  This morning
[2032.28 --> 2033.20]  For your word
[2033.20 --> 2034.78]  Which is absolutely true
[2034.78 --> 2036.20]  And given to us in love
[2036.20 --> 2037.54]  And we thank you
[2037.54 --> 2038.42]  How clear
[2038.42 --> 2041.06]  Your love is for us
[2041.06 --> 2043.10]  It's not wrapped up in mystery
[2043.10 --> 2044.76]  That we can't know it
[2044.76 --> 2048.02]  But it is declared plainly
[2048.02 --> 2049.16]  Before us this day
[2049.16 --> 2051.42]  And we ask that you would
[2051.42 --> 2052.84]  Open our eyes
[2052.84 --> 2053.94]  Open our hearts
[2053.94 --> 2056.02]  By your Holy Spirit
[2056.02 --> 2057.90]  So that with Peter
[2057.90 --> 2059.16]  We would be able to say
[2059.16 --> 2061.34]  Lord, you know that I love you
[2061.34 --> 2062.92]  And we pray
[2062.92 --> 2065.02]  This in Jesus' name
[2065.02 --> 2065.88]  And for his sake
[2065.88 --> 2066.70]  Amen
[2066.70 --> 2071.90]  So in our adult education classes
[2071.90 --> 2073.18]  Called cross-training
[2073.18 --> 2074.50]  We have been studying
[2074.50 --> 2076.22]  The history of the early church
[2076.22 --> 2078.24]  So this is called a plug
[2078.24 --> 2079.92]  If you have
[2079.92 --> 2081.68]  You can still join us
[2081.68 --> 2083.18]  We have several weeks left
[2083.18 --> 2085.96]  But many of you
[2085.96 --> 2088.08]  Probably have some idea
[2088.08 --> 2089.52]  Of the persecutions
[2089.52 --> 2092.12]  That went on in the early church
[2092.12 --> 2094.66]  And these persecutions happened
[2094.66 --> 2097.14]  Because in the Roman Empire
[2097.14 --> 2098.32]  You were allowed
[2098.32 --> 2099.86]  To have your own
[2099.86 --> 2101.08]  Religious beliefs
[2101.08 --> 2101.74]  And practices
[2101.74 --> 2103.60]  As long as you also
[2103.60 --> 2104.92]  Worshipped Caesar
[2104.92 --> 2107.82]  The Romans thought
[2107.82 --> 2109.42]  Well this was very generous
[2109.42 --> 2110.26]  Of them
[2110.26 --> 2112.46]  And they couldn't understand
[2112.46 --> 2113.34]  Why anybody
[2113.34 --> 2114.84]  Would have a problem with this
[2114.84 --> 2117.42]  But who had a problem with this?
[2118.14 --> 2119.18]  The Christians
[2119.18 --> 2120.34]  Right?
[2120.48 --> 2122.16]  The Christians had a problem with this
[2122.16 --> 2123.24]  They refused
[2123.24 --> 2124.72]  To worship Caesar
[2124.72 --> 2126.94]  And they even said
[2126.94 --> 2129.18]  That Jesus is Lord
[2129.18 --> 2131.98]  And they would worship him only
[2131.98 --> 2135.46]  Now this is one of the central confessions
[2135.46 --> 2137.22]  Of the Christian church
[2137.22 --> 2138.78]  That Christ is Lord
[2138.78 --> 2141.72]  And that Caesar is not Lord
[2141.72 --> 2144.72]  And this led to the Christians
[2144.72 --> 2145.66]  Being persecuted
[2145.66 --> 2148.70]  Now there were different responses
[2148.70 --> 2150.58]  To this threat of persecution
[2150.58 --> 2151.90]  Some Christians
[2151.90 --> 2153.94]  Were unwavering in their faith
[2153.94 --> 2155.28]  They stood up for Jesus
[2155.28 --> 2158.44]  No matter what kind of threats
[2158.44 --> 2159.80]  And punishments
[2159.80 --> 2161.46]  Were hurled at them
[2161.46 --> 2162.82]  And they were brutal
[2162.82 --> 2165.56]  But there were also
[2165.56 --> 2166.84]  Plenty of Christians
[2166.84 --> 2169.72]  Who under the threat of torture
[2169.72 --> 2172.44]  Like being eaten by wild animals
[2172.44 --> 2173.94]  And burned alive
[2173.94 --> 2177.04]  Did deny Jesus
[2177.04 --> 2180.44]  And in light of all that was happening
[2180.44 --> 2182.68]  After the persecutions
[2182.68 --> 2184.02]  Kind of died down
[2184.02 --> 2185.70]  There was a great question
[2185.70 --> 2186.70]  In the church
[2186.70 --> 2188.30]  There was a great problem
[2188.30 --> 2188.92]  In the church
[2188.92 --> 2190.36]  What do we do
[2190.36 --> 2191.22]  With the Christians
[2191.22 --> 2192.18]  Who denied Christ?
[2194.82 --> 2195.94]  Who had
[2195.94 --> 2198.50]  Under the threat of persecution
[2198.50 --> 2199.54]  Denied Christ
[2199.54 --> 2202.10]  But who now wanted to come back
[2202.10 --> 2203.46]  Into the church
[2203.46 --> 2205.72]  And there were some factions
[2205.72 --> 2206.42]  Of the church
[2206.42 --> 2206.90]  Who said
[2206.90 --> 2208.48]  No, no, no
[2208.48 --> 2209.82]  You are done
[2209.82 --> 2210.58]  Right?
[2210.66 --> 2211.88]  You proved faithless
[2211.88 --> 2213.96]  When you should have proved faithful
[2213.96 --> 2216.12]  You are not allowed back in
[2216.12 --> 2218.38]  But in the end
[2218.38 --> 2219.34]  The church decided
[2219.34 --> 2220.88]  We need to show grace
[2220.88 --> 2223.52]  To our fallen brothers and sisters
[2223.52 --> 2224.84]  And restore them
[2224.84 --> 2225.94]  Restore them to fellowship
[2225.94 --> 2227.86]  Restore them to the church
[2227.86 --> 2232.94]  Now, one of the arguments
[2232.94 --> 2233.74]  They made
[2233.74 --> 2234.70]  As you can imagine
[2234.70 --> 2236.30]  Is this case of Peter
[2236.30 --> 2237.44]  Right?
[2237.56 --> 2239.48]  If the great apostle Peter
[2239.48 --> 2241.32]  Can deny the Lord
[2241.32 --> 2243.66]  And have Jesus restore him
[2243.66 --> 2245.90]  Then why should we not do the same?
[2247.26 --> 2248.60]  And so the question
[2248.60 --> 2250.32]  Of whether or not Christians
[2250.32 --> 2251.56]  Can be restored
[2251.56 --> 2253.76]  The answer is obviously yes
[2253.76 --> 2255.98]  And we are given the example
[2255.98 --> 2257.02]  Of Peter
[2257.02 --> 2259.40]  Now
[2259.40 --> 2262.46]  I'm guessing most of you
[2262.46 --> 2264.84]  Have not been in this kind of situation before
[2264.84 --> 2267.38]  This kind of situation where
[2267.38 --> 2269.66]  You denied Jesus
[2269.66 --> 2272.80]  But this passage
[2272.80 --> 2274.48]  Is still perfect
[2274.48 --> 2276.68]  For many of us here today
[2276.68 --> 2279.84]  Because many of us are quietly thinking
[2279.84 --> 2282.06]  I love Jesus
[2282.06 --> 2282.86]  Right?
[2282.94 --> 2284.56]  I really do love Jesus
[2284.56 --> 2285.88]  And I wish
[2285.88 --> 2288.04]  I was a stronger Christian
[2288.04 --> 2291.10]  But there are times
[2291.10 --> 2292.44]  When I have let him down
[2292.44 --> 2293.86]  Right?
[2293.94 --> 2294.98]  I was weak
[2294.98 --> 2296.54]  Life was hard
[2296.54 --> 2298.34]  Temptation was strong
[2298.34 --> 2300.16]  Decisions were complicated
[2300.16 --> 2302.14]  And I failed him
[2302.14 --> 2306.34]  I mean I wish I was better
[2306.34 --> 2308.72]  At this being a Christian thing
[2308.72 --> 2310.60]  Apparently some people
[2310.60 --> 2311.46]  Are good at it
[2311.46 --> 2312.88]  But I am not
[2312.88 --> 2314.40]  And I wonder
[2314.40 --> 2316.86]  What God really
[2316.86 --> 2317.98]  Thinks of me
[2317.98 --> 2320.68]  And I think many of us
[2320.68 --> 2321.50]  Can relate to that
[2321.50 --> 2322.60]  Right?
[2323.10 --> 2324.30]  And for those of us
[2324.30 --> 2325.54]  Who can relate to that
[2325.54 --> 2327.76]  The message in this text
[2327.76 --> 2328.46]  Is wonderful
[2328.46 --> 2330.30]  Because it shows us
[2330.30 --> 2330.82]  That Jesus
[2330.82 --> 2332.56]  Knows our hearts
[2332.56 --> 2335.50]  He knows how unsteady
[2335.50 --> 2336.30]  We can be
[2336.30 --> 2337.50]  He knows everything
[2337.50 --> 2338.30]  About us
[2338.30 --> 2339.50]  And he still
[2339.50 --> 2340.92]  Wants you
[2340.92 --> 2343.56]  He still wants
[2343.56 --> 2344.84]  To be in relationship
[2344.84 --> 2345.32]  With you
[2345.32 --> 2348.14]  And that is what
[2348.14 --> 2348.92]  Peter discovers
[2348.92 --> 2350.30]  In our text this morning
[2350.30 --> 2351.90]  And so
[2351.90 --> 2353.28]  We're going to follow
[2353.28 --> 2354.60]  Again this interaction
[2354.60 --> 2355.80]  Between Jesus and Peter
[2355.80 --> 2356.92]  And I want us to see
[2356.92 --> 2358.66]  How Jesus moves
[2358.66 --> 2359.52]  Towards Peter
[2359.52 --> 2360.56]  And how he
[2360.56 --> 2361.86]  Restores Peter
[2361.86 --> 2363.60]  And I want us to see
[2363.60 --> 2364.46]  How Jesus can do
[2364.46 --> 2365.42]  The same thing
[2365.42 --> 2366.06]  For us
[2366.06 --> 2367.20]  Today as well
[2367.20 --> 2369.16]  So we're going to look
[2369.16 --> 2370.26]  At this in three parts
[2370.26 --> 2370.88]  Briefly
[2370.88 --> 2372.30]  So the first thing
[2372.30 --> 2374.34]  We see in this interaction
[2374.34 --> 2375.30]  Is that Jesus
[2375.30 --> 2377.26]  Reveals our failure
[2377.26 --> 2379.00]  Okay so first
[2379.00 --> 2380.88]  Jesus reveals
[2380.88 --> 2382.22]  Our failure
[2382.22 --> 2383.78]  So we're going to pick up
[2383.78 --> 2384.22]  And we're just going to
[2384.22 --> 2385.22]  Read through the story again
[2385.22 --> 2386.42]  Just one verse at a time
[2386.42 --> 2387.42]  Verse 15
[2387.42 --> 2389.40]  When they had finished eating
[2389.40 --> 2391.78]  So they're on the beach
[2391.78 --> 2392.12]  You know
[2392.12 --> 2393.16]  They're on the beach
[2393.16 --> 2395.06]  They're having a fire
[2395.06 --> 2395.70]  Campfire
[2395.70 --> 2396.54]  They're roasting fish
[2396.54 --> 2398.02]  They're roasting some bread
[2398.02 --> 2399.66]  This is what we looked at last week
[2399.66 --> 2401.64]  Now they're having this conversation
[2401.64 --> 2402.46]  The meal's over
[2402.46 --> 2403.08]  You know
[2403.08 --> 2404.04]  They're satisfied
[2404.04 --> 2405.16]  They're having a good time
[2405.16 --> 2407.12]  And Jesus decides
[2407.12 --> 2408.08]  To bring something up
[2408.08 --> 2408.78]  With Peter
[2408.78 --> 2411.30]  Jesus said to Simon Peter
[2411.30 --> 2412.42]  Simon son of John
[2412.42 --> 2414.64]  Do you love me more than these?
[2415.36 --> 2415.68]  Meaning
[2415.68 --> 2417.28]  Do you love me more than
[2417.28 --> 2419.02]  The other disciples love me?
[2420.60 --> 2421.56]  Yes Lord
[2421.56 --> 2424.04]  He said
[2424.04 --> 2425.18]  You know that I love you
[2425.18 --> 2426.60]  Jesus said
[2426.60 --> 2427.54]  Feed my lambs
[2427.54 --> 2428.86]  Okay so now
[2428.86 --> 2429.32]  We got to
[2429.32 --> 2430.32]  Let's think about Jesus
[2430.32 --> 2431.88]  Sorry Peter's story
[2431.88 --> 2432.92]  Here
[2432.92 --> 2434.02]  Peter
[2434.02 --> 2435.42]  Is one of
[2435.42 --> 2436.64]  Jesus' best friends
[2436.64 --> 2437.20]  I don't know gems
[2437.20 --> 2438.42]  Do you have a best friend?
[2438.96 --> 2440.20]  Maybe a friend is pretty good
[2440.20 --> 2441.00]  Okay
[2441.00 --> 2441.64]  So
[2441.64 --> 2443.98]  Peter
[2443.98 --> 2445.26]  Is one of
[2445.26 --> 2446.48]  Jesus' best friends
[2446.48 --> 2448.56]  And earlier
[2448.56 --> 2449.98]  In the gospel of John
[2449.98 --> 2451.50]  Peter had boasted
[2451.50 --> 2452.82]  About his love
[2452.82 --> 2453.48]  For Jesus
[2453.48 --> 2455.50]  And even
[2455.50 --> 2456.12]  Of his
[2456.12 --> 2457.10]  Shall we say
[2457.10 --> 2457.92]  Superior
[2457.92 --> 2458.22]  Superior
[2458.22 --> 2459.48]  Superiority
[2459.48 --> 2460.66]  To the other disciples
[2460.66 --> 2461.84]  He said
[2461.84 --> 2462.80]  Even if
[2462.80 --> 2463.80]  Everyone else
[2463.80 --> 2464.64]  Abandons you
[2464.64 --> 2465.06]  Even if
[2465.06 --> 2465.72]  Everyone else
[2465.72 --> 2466.20]  Leaves you
[2466.20 --> 2467.56]  I will never
[2467.56 --> 2468.50]  Leave you
[2468.50 --> 2470.20]  Even if
[2470.20 --> 2471.14]  I have to
[2471.14 --> 2472.44]  Die for you
[2472.44 --> 2474.10]  I will never
[2474.10 --> 2475.02]  Forsake you
[2475.02 --> 2476.82]  So he is
[2476.82 --> 2477.52]  Loudly
[2477.52 --> 2478.48]  Proclaiming
[2478.48 --> 2479.26]  His love
[2479.26 --> 2480.04]  For Christ
[2480.04 --> 2481.40]  And is that
[2481.40 --> 2481.94]  Not
[2481.94 --> 2483.14]  A great
[2483.14 --> 2483.88]  Declaration
[2483.88 --> 2484.82]  Of love
[2484.82 --> 2485.66]  For someone
[2485.66 --> 2486.32]  When you say
[2486.32 --> 2486.98]  I would
[2486.98 --> 2487.78]  Lay down
[2487.78 --> 2488.36]  My life
[2488.36 --> 2488.80]  For you
[2488.80 --> 2490.70]  Because
[2490.70 --> 2491.34]  Jesus
[2491.34 --> 2492.54]  Actually said
[2492.54 --> 2494.46]  Greater love
[2494.46 --> 2495.40]  Has no one
[2495.40 --> 2496.02]  Than this
[2496.02 --> 2497.60]  To lay down
[2497.60 --> 2498.40]  One's life
[2498.40 --> 2499.50]  For one's
[2499.50 --> 2499.90]  Friends
[2499.90 --> 2501.36]  And so
[2501.36 --> 2502.00]  Peter is saying
[2502.00 --> 2502.84]  I will lay down
[2502.84 --> 2503.48]  My life for you
[2503.48 --> 2503.78]  Jesus
[2503.78 --> 2505.14]  That is how
[2505.14 --> 2505.62]  Much
[2505.62 --> 2506.78]  I love you
[2506.78 --> 2508.22]  And yet
[2508.22 --> 2509.02]  Just a short time
[2509.02 --> 2509.42]  Later
[2509.42 --> 2510.68]  Peter failed
[2510.68 --> 2511.18]  His friend
[2511.18 --> 2513.52]  He publicly
[2513.52 --> 2514.72]  Denied
[2514.72 --> 2515.42]  Jesus
[2515.42 --> 2516.78]  Three times
[2516.78 --> 2518.62]  And in Luke's
[2518.62 --> 2519.18]  Gospel we're
[2519.18 --> 2519.98]  Actually told that
[2519.98 --> 2521.32]  Jesus looked at
[2521.32 --> 2521.72]  Peter
[2521.72 --> 2522.88]  They made eye
[2522.88 --> 2523.28]  Contact
[2523.28 --> 2525.18]  As he was
[2525.18 --> 2526.02]  Denying Jesus
[2526.02 --> 2526.74]  The last time
[2526.74 --> 2528.08]  Can you imagine
[2528.08 --> 2528.38]  That
[2528.38 --> 2529.58]  Can you imagine
[2529.58 --> 2531.06]  Someone you
[2531.06 --> 2531.84]  Love making
[2531.84 --> 2532.68]  Eye contact
[2532.68 --> 2533.20]  With you
[2533.20 --> 2534.72]  As you deny
[2534.72 --> 2536.22]  Your friendship
[2536.22 --> 2536.82]  With them
[2536.82 --> 2540.20]  And it says
[2540.20 --> 2541.16]  Peter went
[2541.16 --> 2541.80]  Outside
[2541.80 --> 2542.92]  And wept
[2542.92 --> 2544.04]  Bitterly
[2544.04 --> 2546.94]  So this is
[2546.94 --> 2547.32]  Probably
[2547.32 --> 2547.94]  Just the
[2547.94 --> 2549.26]  The darkest
[2549.26 --> 2549.68]  Moment
[2549.68 --> 2550.24]  For Peter
[2550.24 --> 2550.92]  This is a
[2550.92 --> 2551.88]  Deep failure
[2551.88 --> 2553.76]  In Peter's
[2553.76 --> 2554.02]  Life
[2554.02 --> 2554.68]  He failed
[2554.68 --> 2555.06]  Jesus
[2555.06 --> 2555.42]  In a
[2555.42 --> 2555.98]  Colossal
[2555.98 --> 2556.24]  Way
[2556.24 --> 2557.90]  And that
[2557.90 --> 2558.20]  Is the
[2558.20 --> 2558.44]  Relevant
[2558.44 --> 2559.18]  Backstory
[2559.18 --> 2559.64]  To
[2559.64 --> 2560.12]  That we
[2560.12 --> 2560.42]  Need to
[2560.42 --> 2560.74]  Know
[2560.74 --> 2561.58]  To understand
[2561.58 --> 2561.84]  This
[2561.84 --> 2562.36]  Interaction
[2562.36 --> 2562.80]  Between
[2562.80 --> 2563.14]  Jesus
[2563.14 --> 2563.38]  And
[2563.38 --> 2563.62]  Peter
[2563.62 --> 2564.76]  So now
[2564.76 --> 2565.16]  Here we
[2565.16 --> 2565.56]  Are in
[2565.56 --> 2566.34]  John 21
[2566.34 --> 2567.84]  And despite
[2567.84 --> 2568.78]  What Peter
[2568.78 --> 2569.20]  Did
[2569.20 --> 2569.72]  How he
[2569.72 --> 2570.56]  Abandoned
[2570.56 --> 2570.86]  Him
[2570.86 --> 2572.16]  Jesus
[2572.16 --> 2572.84]  Comes
[2572.84 --> 2573.24]  To
[2573.24 --> 2573.62]  Peter
[2573.62 --> 2574.80]  In his
[2574.80 --> 2575.64]  Resurrection
[2575.64 --> 2576.10]  Risen
[2576.10 --> 2576.54]  Life
[2576.54 --> 2578.34]  And he
[2578.34 --> 2578.56]  Wants
[2578.56 --> 2579.14]  To restore
[2579.14 --> 2579.54]  Peter
[2579.54 --> 2580.66]  But in
[2580.66 --> 2580.94]  Order
[2580.94 --> 2581.42]  To do
[2581.42 --> 2581.70]  That
[2581.70 --> 2582.00]  Jesus
[2582.00 --> 2582.44]  Is going
[2582.44 --> 2582.76]  To have
[2582.76 --> 2583.54]  To expose
[2583.54 --> 2585.06]  Peter's
[2585.06 --> 2585.44]  Failure
[2585.44 --> 2586.32]  He
[2586.32 --> 2586.94]  He's
[2586.94 --> 2587.06]  Going
[2587.06 --> 2587.18]  To
[2587.18 --> 2587.88]  Expose
[2587.88 --> 2588.06]  It
[2588.06 --> 2588.52]  And bring
[2588.52 --> 2588.68]  It
[2588.68 --> 2588.92]  Into
[2588.92 --> 2589.12]  The
[2589.12 --> 2589.38]  Light
[2589.38 --> 2589.88]  So
[2589.88 --> 2590.18]  That
[2590.18 --> 2590.34]  It
[2590.34 --> 2590.52]  Can
[2590.52 --> 2590.70]  Be
[2590.70 --> 2591.08]  Healed
[2591.08 --> 2592.42]  This
[2592.42 --> 2592.58]  Is
[2592.58 --> 2593.02]  How
[2593.02 --> 2593.82]  Jesus
[2593.82 --> 2594.20]  Does
[2594.20 --> 2594.56]  This
[2594.56 --> 2595.22]  This
[2595.22 --> 2595.48]  Is how
[2595.48 --> 2595.84]  Jesus
[2595.84 --> 2596.52]  Exposes
[2596.52 --> 2597.18]  Peter's
[2597.18 --> 2597.52]  Failure
[2597.52 --> 2597.96]  First
[2597.96 --> 2598.60]  He
[2598.60 --> 2598.92]  Uses
[2598.92 --> 2599.44]  Peter's
[2599.44 --> 2599.92]  Old
[2599.92 --> 2600.52]  Name
[2600.52 --> 2600.78]  Did
[2600.78 --> 2600.88]  You
[2600.88 --> 2601.10]  Notice
[2601.10 --> 2601.40]  That
[2601.40 --> 2602.92]  Simon
[2602.92 --> 2604.74]  Referring
[2604.74 --> 2604.90]  To
[2604.90 --> 2605.12]  Who
[2605.12 --> 2605.34]  He
[2605.34 --> 2605.60]  Used
[2605.60 --> 2605.74]  To
[2605.74 --> 2606.04]  Be
[2606.04 --> 2607.04]  Right
[2607.04 --> 2607.32]  Jesus
[2607.32 --> 2607.56]  Had
[2607.56 --> 2607.92]  Given
[2607.92 --> 2609.00]  Simon
[2609.00 --> 2609.46]  A
[2609.46 --> 2609.62]  New
[2609.62 --> 2609.90]  Name
[2609.90 --> 2610.28]  Peter
[2610.28 --> 2610.60]  And
[2610.60 --> 2610.80]  What's
[2610.80 --> 2611.02]  Peter
[2611.02 --> 2611.30]  Mean
[2611.30 --> 2611.52]  Anybody
[2611.52 --> 2611.80]  Know
[2611.80 --> 2612.34]  Gems
[2612.34 --> 2614.22]  Rock
[2614.22 --> 2615.32]  Okay
[2615.32 --> 2615.78]  Remember
[2615.78 --> 2616.00]  That
[2616.00 --> 2616.42]  Peter
[2616.42 --> 2616.92]  Means
[2616.92 --> 2617.20]  The
[2617.20 --> 2617.60]  Rock
[2617.60 --> 2619.34]  But
[2619.34 --> 2619.80]  Peter
[2619.80 --> 2620.50]  Had
[2620.50 --> 2620.86]  Not
[2620.86 --> 2621.36]  Been
[2621.36 --> 2621.70]  A
[2621.70 --> 2622.00]  Rock
[2622.00 --> 2622.26]  Had
[2622.26 --> 2622.48]  He
[2622.48 --> 2623.32]  His
[2623.32 --> 2623.58]  Face
[2623.58 --> 2623.78]  Had
[2623.78 --> 2624.52]  Crumbled
[2624.52 --> 2624.78]  To
[2624.78 --> 2625.26]  Gravel
[2625.26 --> 2626.32]  He
[2626.32 --> 2626.48]  Was
[2626.48 --> 2626.70]  Supposed
[2626.70 --> 2626.80]  To
[2626.80 --> 2626.90]  Be
[2626.90 --> 2627.06]  The
[2627.06 --> 2627.44]  Strong
[2627.44 --> 2627.80]  Rock
[2627.80 --> 2628.30]  His
[2628.30 --> 2628.66]  Faith
[2628.66 --> 2629.10]  Had
[2629.10 --> 2629.48]  Crumbled
[2629.48 --> 2630.64]  So
[2630.64 --> 2631.00]  Jesus
[2631.00 --> 2631.42]  Uses
[2631.42 --> 2631.64]  His
[2631.64 --> 2632.02]  Old
[2632.02 --> 2632.44]  Name
[2632.44 --> 2632.70]  To
[2632.70 --> 2633.00]  Show
[2633.00 --> 2633.30]  Him
[2633.30 --> 2633.78]  How
[2633.78 --> 2634.08]  Far
[2634.08 --> 2634.80]  Backwards
[2634.80 --> 2635.04]  He

[2954.24 --> 2954.44]  Or
[2954.44 --> 2954.94]  Dad
[2954.94 --> 2956.94]  Knowing

[2965.14 --> 2965.28]  Can
[2965.28 --> 2965.84]  Operate
[2965.84 --> 2966.56]  Because
[2966.56 --> 2966.96]  In
[2966.96 --> 2967.08]  The

[2973.32 --> 2974.62]  He
[2974.62 --> 2974.74]  Is
[2974.74 --> 2974.92]  Not

[2982.42 --> 2982.54]  I
[2982.54 --> 2982.68]  Want
[2982.68 --> 2982.78]  To

[3165.52 --> 3167.38]  Right
[3167.38 --> 3167.78]  And
[3167.78 --> 3168.08]  Jesus
[3168.08 --> 3168.44]  Isn't
[3168.44 --> 3169.16]  Shocked

[3171.00 --> 3171.30]  Us
[3171.30 --> 3172.48]  Right

[3178.00 --> 3178.46]  Accepts
[3178.46 --> 3178.64]  It

[3185.24 --> 3186.06]  Times
[3186.06 --> 3187.30]  Right
[3187.30 --> 3187.70]  So
[3187.70 --> 3188.48]  Gems
[3188.48 --> 3189.70]  When
[3189.70 --> 3190.24]  Jesus

[3194.68 --> 3194.76]  You
[3194.76 --> 3194.96]  Think
[3194.96 --> 3195.42]  Jesus
[3195.42 --> 3195.86]  Believed
[3195.86 --> 3196.14]  Him
[3196.14 --> 3198.70]  What
[3198.70 --> 3198.78]  Do

[3200.78 --> 3201.08]  Too
[3201.08 --> 3201.52]  I
[3201.52 --> 3201.74]  Think
[3201.74 --> 3202.06]  Jesus
[3202.06 --> 3202.42]  Believed
[3202.42 --> 3202.70]  Him
[3202.70 --> 3204.62]  Jesus
[3204.62 --> 3205.26]  Knew
[3205.26 --> 3205.72]  That
[3205.72 --> 3206.04]  Peter
[3206.04 --> 3206.56]  Really
[3206.56 --> 3206.80]  Did
[3206.80 --> 3207.06]  Love
[3207.06 --> 3207.30]  Him
[3207.30 --> 3208.78]  Now
[3208.78 --> 3209.50]  Jesus
[3209.50 --> 3210.04]  Asked
[3210.04 --> 3210.16]  The
[3210.16 --> 3210.42]  Second
[3210.42 --> 3210.74]  Time
[3210.74 --> 3210.94]  Did
[3210.94 --> 3211.20]  Jesus
[3211.20 --> 3211.52]  Believe
[3211.52 --> 3211.68]  Him
[3211.68 --> 3211.86]  The

[3215.56 --> 3215.88]  Believe
[3215.88 --> 3216.02]  Him

[3216.82 --> 3217.72]  Yes

[3220.06 --> 3220.24]  Three
[3220.24 --> 3220.74]  Times
[3220.74 --> 3222.32]  It's
[3222.32 --> 3222.68]  Because
[3222.68 --> 3223.32]  Jesus
[3223.32 --> 3224.46]  Knew
[3224.46 --> 3224.64]  That
[3224.64 --> 3224.80]  He
[3224.80 --> 3225.08]  Needed
[3225.08 --> 3225.18]  To

[3228.24 --> 3228.42]  Still
[3228.42 --> 3228.86]  Living
[3228.86 --> 3229.18]  With
[3229.18 --> 3229.82]  Fear
[3229.82 --> 3230.32]  In
[3230.32 --> 3230.78]  Agony
[3230.78 --> 3230.96]  He

[3231.16 --> 3231.40]  Know
[3231.40 --> 3231.64]  If
[3231.64 --> 3232.28]  If
[3232.28 --> 3232.68]  Jesus
[3232.68 --> 3233.34]  Accepts
[3233.34 --> 3233.52]  Him
[3233.52 --> 3233.66]  Or
[3233.66 --> 3233.78]  If
[3233.78 --> 3234.00]  Jesus
[3234.00 --> 3234.34]  Loves
[3234.34 --> 3234.60]  Him
[3234.60 --> 3236.74]  Maybe
[3236.74 --> 3237.28]  He
[3237.28 --> 3237.50]  Didn't
[3237.50 --> 3237.66]  Know
[3237.66 --> 3237.88]  Where
[3237.88 --> 3238.10]  He
[3238.10 --> 3238.48]  Stood
[3238.48 --> 3238.78]  With
[3238.78 --> 3239.18]  Jesus
[3239.18 --> 3239.62]  He
[3239.62 --> 3239.98]  Wasn't
[3239.98 --> 3240.56]  Settled
[3240.56 --> 3240.76]  In
[3240.76 --> 3241.04]  His
[3241.04 --> 3241.56]  Emotional
[3241.56 --> 3242.10]  State
[3242.10 --> 3242.90]  That
[3242.90 --> 3243.10]  Him
[3243.10 --> 3243.24]  And
[3243.24 --> 3243.46]  Christ
[3243.46 --> 3243.62]  Were
[3243.62 --> 3243.92]  Good

[3244.44 --> 3245.22]  Reconciled
[3245.22 --> 3246.76]  And

[3253.00 --> 3253.20]  On
[3253.20 --> 3253.48]  Peter
[3253.48 --> 3253.70]  And
[3253.70 --> 3253.88]  He
[3253.88 --> 3254.48]  Restores
[3254.48 --> 3254.68]  Him
[3254.68 --> 3255.32]  Graciously

[3257.28 --> 3257.60]  Jesus
[3257.60 --> 3258.16]  Assures
[3258.16 --> 3258.58]  Peter
[3258.58 --> 3259.06]  That
[3259.06 --> 3259.32]  He
[3259.32 --> 3259.74]  Knows
[3259.74 --> 3259.94]  His
[3259.94 --> 3260.30]  Heart
[3260.30 --> 3261.30]  He
[3261.30 --> 3261.72]  Knows
[3261.72 --> 3261.90]  That
[3261.90 --> 3262.16]  Peter
[3262.16 --> 3262.44]  Loves
[3262.44 --> 3262.70]  Him
[3262.70 --> 3263.62]  And
[3263.62 --> 3263.78]  He
[3263.78 --> 3264.12]  Wants
[3264.12 --> 3264.28]  To

[3264.70 --> 3264.94]  That
[3264.94 --> 3265.42]  Peter
[3265.42 --> 3266.28]  Knows
[3266.28 --> 3266.60]  That
[3266.60 --> 3267.52]  And
[3267.52 --> 3267.66]  That
[3267.66 --> 3267.96]  Jesus
[3267.96 --> 3268.58]  Accepts
[3268.58 --> 3268.74]  His
[3268.74 --> 3269.06]  Love
[3269.06 --> 3270.44]  Because
[3270.44 --> 3270.60]  That's
[3270.60 --> 3270.74]  The

[3820.22 --> 3820.92]  God

[3834.92 --> 3835.74]  That

[3842.34 --> 3843.08]  I
[3843.08 --> 3843.74]  Scared

[3847.74 --> 3848.16]  On

[3855.10 --> 3855.50]  Him
[3855.50 --> 3856.38]  Die
[3856.38 --> 3857.08]  To
[3857.08 --> 3857.70]  Take
[3857.70 --> 3858.46]  Away

[3865.28 --> 3865.98]  God

[3878.56 --> 3880.78]  God
[3882.14 --> 3882.26]  How
[3882.26 --> 3882.90]  Great

[3886.96 --> 3888.22]  Thou
[3888.30 --> 3890.58]  Art
[3890.58 --> 3905.54]  When Christ shall come, which comes of acclamation, and take me home, my joy shall fill my heart.
[3905.54 --> 3920.00]  Then I shall bow in humble adoration, and there go King, my God, how great Thou art.
[3920.00 --> 3934.24]  Then takes my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[3934.24 --> 3951.42]  Then takes my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[3951.42 --> 3952.42]  Amen.
[3961.88 --> 3969.60]  So as our worship leader John announced earlier, our designated offering today is for our Gems ministry.
[3970.50 --> 3976.04]  And so we will ask some of our Gems girls to come and help collect the morning offering.
[3976.04 --> 3998.72]  I hear the Savior say,
[3998.72 --> 4003.48]  Thy strength indeed is small.
[4004.26 --> 4008.34]  Child, don't leave this once and pray.
[4009.14 --> 4012.84]  Find to me, the null in all.
[4012.84 --> 4022.72]  Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[4023.72 --> 4032.02]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4032.02 --> 4048.72]  Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
[4048.72 --> 4058.08]  And changed the lepers' thoughts, And felt this heart of stone.
[4058.08 --> 4068.08]  Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[4068.08 --> 4077.08]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4077.08 --> 4084.08]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4084.08 --> 4093.08]  Lord, nothing good have I, Whereby Thy grace to claim.
[4093.08 --> 4102.08]  I washed my garments white In the blood of Calvary's night.
[4102.08 --> 4109.08]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4109.08 --> 4113.08]  Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[4113.08 --> 4117.08]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4117.08 --> 4120.08]  Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
[4120.08 --> 4123.08]  Jesus paid it white as snow.
[4123.08 --> 4125.08]  But I was a sinner, I would have to do it with my sins.
[4125.08 --> 4126.08]  Amen.
[4126.08 --> 4127.08]  Amen.
[4127.08 --> 4128.08]  Amen.
[4128.08 --> 4129.08]  Amen.
[4129.08 --> 4130.08]  Amen.
[4130.08 --> 4131.08]  Amen.
[4131.08 --> 4136.08]  Amen.
[4136.08 --> 4141.08]  So we now come to a time when we come before the Lord in prayer.
[4141.08 --> 4147.08]  And we come before our Father to pray for some of the needs in our own congregation,
[4147.08 --> 4149.08]  and for the needs around the world.
[4149.08 --> 4155.08]  As we do so, I want to begin with reading a few verses from Psalm 146.
[4155.08 --> 4160.08]  If you are not in prayer, then please join me in prayer, and we will conclude with the words of the Lord's Prayer,
[4160.08 --> 4162.08]  which we will have on the screen.
[4162.08 --> 4167.08]  So please hear these words from Psalm 146.
[4167.08 --> 4194.08]  p.
[4194.08 --> 4200.36]  up those who are bowed down. The Lord loves the righteous. The Lord watches over the alien and
[4200.36 --> 4206.56]  sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked. The Lord reigns
[4206.56 --> 4218.20]  forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your heart
[4218.20 --> 4227.60]  that we see throughout the scriptures and most clearly in our Lord Jesus, who came to set the
[4227.60 --> 4235.46]  prisoner free, to give sight to the blind, to heal the sick, to reign as sovereign Lord over creation,
[4236.46 --> 4244.72]  and ultimately to lay down his life for his friends. Lord, we praise you. You are the God
[4244.72 --> 4254.86]  who is our Lord, not Caesar, but Lord, you are Lord, and you are our Savior. You are our Redeemer.
[4256.48 --> 4263.24]  And Lord, as we look at the world that is still very much hurting, we again and still lift up to you
[4263.24 --> 4270.60]  what is happening in the Middle East, the land even that Jesus trod. And we pray, Lord, for
[4270.60 --> 4278.74]  those who are suffering, for the people of the land, whether they are Palestinian or Jewish. And Lord,
[4278.78 --> 4285.22]  we pray that you would bring an end to violence, that you would provide comfort for the grieving,
[4285.76 --> 4293.76]  food for the hungry, medicine for the sick, and that, Lord, many hearts would be healed and turned
[4293.76 --> 4302.64]  toward you. Lord, we pray again for those in our congregation, especially those who have recently
[4302.64 --> 4310.46]  lost a loved one. We pray for Jake, for Bev, for Henny, and for Jerry and others as well.
[4312.14 --> 4321.04]  And Lord, for those who feel the deep sadness, the loss, their spouse who is missing, or
[4321.04 --> 4329.48]  a sister, or Lord, someone they love. Lord, would you comfort the grieving? Would you comfort the hurt?
[4330.80 --> 4336.00]  And Lord, we thank you that Jesus, who is our resurrected Lord, who came and rose and
[4336.00 --> 4344.10]  came to be with his disciples, still comes to be with us through the Spirit of the Lord who is with us.
[4344.10 --> 4355.28]  Lord, we thank you so much for our gems. We thank you for our leaders. We thank you for each of the
[4355.28 --> 4359.44]  girls that you have brought to be part of this ministry. Lord, we thank you for what you are
[4359.44 --> 4365.68]  teaching them, for the relationships that they can have with one another, for the fun that they can
[4365.68 --> 4373.08]  have. And Lord, we pray that they would continue to grow up to be strengthened in their faith,
[4373.08 --> 4379.22]  so that they could know, Lord, your love for them, and that they could love you more.
[4380.44 --> 4389.32]  Lord, we pray all of these things in the words that you taught us. You taught your disciples how to
[4389.32 --> 4397.66]  pray. And so we say those words together, saying, our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
[4397.66 --> 4406.36]  thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread,
[4406.78 --> 4414.02]  and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
[4414.02 --> 4422.06]  temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and
[4422.06 --> 4431.58]  ever. Amen. So please stand, and we will conclude our time of worship together. And again, you are
[4431.58 --> 4436.78]  invited to join us for time of coffee, refreshments in the fellowship hall, which is through the doors
[4436.78 --> 4444.64]  there. And after the benediction, which is a blessing of God upon you, we'll sing one last song.
[4444.64 --> 4451.24]  So I invite you to hold out your hands, and this is just a gesture of receiving God's blessing. So may
[4451.24 --> 4456.82]  the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[4456.82 --> 4460.08]  be with each of you now and forever. Amen.
[4474.64 --> 4483.32]  Amen.
[4483.32 --> 4487.16]  Amen.
[4487.16 --> 4487.90]  Amen.
[4487.90 --> 4492.30]  Amen.
[4492.30 --> 4500.10]  Amen.
[4500.10 --> 4506.02]  And He paid His marriage to live, to save His lives.
[4506.48 --> 4512.42]  Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[4513.64 --> 4519.20]  Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[4519.20 --> 4534.80]  Because I know He holds the future, and life is worth living just because He lives.
[4534.80 --> 4549.80]  How it means to hold a new baby, and feel the pride and joy begin.
[4551.54 --> 4561.80]  But greater still, the calm assurance this child can face in certain days.
[4561.80 --> 4572.40]  Because Christ lives, because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[4573.60 --> 4579.80]  Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[4579.80 --> 4595.26]  Because I know He holds the future, and life is worth living just because He lives.
[4595.26 --> 4604.74]  And then one day, I'll cross that river.
[4605.96 --> 4612.26]  I'll fight like a final war with pain.
[4612.26 --> 4620.26]  And then as death, guess what you dream dream.
[4621.06 --> 4628.32]  I'll see the lights of glory, and I'll know He reigns.
[4628.32 --> 4635.18]  Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[4636.42 --> 4642.26]  Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[4642.26 --> 4659.26]  Because I know He holds the future, and life is worth living just because He lives.
[4659.26 --> 4689.24]  I know He lives, all fear is gone.
[4689.24 --> 4690.32]  Oh, boy.
