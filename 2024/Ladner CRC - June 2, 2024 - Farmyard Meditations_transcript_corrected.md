[339.88 → 340.88] Good morning.
[340.88 → 341.88] Good morning.
[341.88 → 343.88] This is not my normal place.
[343.88 → 348.88] I'm filling in for a worship leader who, at the last minute, was not able to make it here
[348.88 → 349.88] today.
[349.88 → 358.88] So, I will start off as the worship leader and our pastor, our visiting pastor, Todd Stat ham,
[358.88 → 363.88] look after the rest of the service as far as leading us.
[363.88 → 364.88] Just a few things.
[364.88 → 367.88] First, welcome to everyone.
[367.88 → 370.88] It's good to see you all here today.
[370.88 → 374.88] Special welcome, especially, to any visitors that we might have.
[374.88 → 381.88] And please remember, we do have a time of refreshments and fellowship in the back fellowship
[381.88 → 383.88] hall after the service.
[383.88 → 385.88] Please join us.
[385.88 → 394.88] Also, a welcome to anyone that might be tuning in online live stream as far as this service
[394.88 → 395.88] goes.
[395.88 → 396.88] Thank you.
[396.88 → 407.88] great, just a couple of things that we should and might want to know about as a congregation.
[407.88 → 411.88] George Cullen was able to come home this week.
[411.88 → 414.88] He was also involved in a move.
[414.88 → 421.10] I hope he wasn't too involved personally, but they moved homes, but he is home.
[422.38 → 426.20] Obviously, he's still under doctor's care, and we continue to remember him.
[427.68 → 431.58] We also continue to remember the Iron family.
[433.18 → 435.90] Amy Iron passed away a number of weeks ago.
[436.68 → 439.96] The family had a memorial service for her yesterday,
[439.96 → 443.98] and we continue to remember them in our thoughts, in our prayers.
[444.88 → 451.32] And we also remember the DeVos family, especially Jim and Anita, an extended family.
[451.60 → 460.06] They, on Thursday, laid an uncle to rest in the United States, and we continue to mourn with them as well.
[461.06 → 468.84] And just a reminder that this Thursday, there will be memorial service for Jeanette Underwood,
[468.84 → 470.78] who passed away a couple of weeks ago.
[470.78 → 475.28] The service is scheduled for 11 o'clock in this church.
[478.10 → 478.78] Saturday.
[479.50 → 479.94] Sorry.
[481.40 → 483.84] Saturday, the 8th of June.
[484.00 → 484.24] Sorry.
[485.72 → 486.56] Thank you.
[486.56 → 494.12] I think that's it for the announcements that we'll have for today.
[494.88 → 502.40] I do want to warmly welcome Pastor Todd Stat ham, who will open God's word for us and also lead us in this service.
[503.72 → 504.60] God is a missionary.
[505.08 → 514.40] Todd is a missionary of the CRC, serving the UBC Okanagan campus as a university chaplain.
[514.40 → 521.76] He helps undergrads, international students, and professors grow their faith in Christ.
[522.72 → 528.28] He seeks to be a catalyst for thoughtful Christian engagement with university culture.
[529.40 → 536.00] Todd has previously served as a missionary in Malawi and a university lecturer in Germany.
[536.00 → 541.92] He's married to Annika, who is a horse-assisted educator and therapist.
[542.86 → 547.12] Together, they have three children, ages 17, 14, and 11.
[548.06 → 549.14] They live in Kelowna.
[549.90 → 551.62] Todd is not foreign to us.
[552.46 → 556.14] We have the pleasure of having Todd with us from time to time,
[556.14 → 560.84] and we very much appreciate his willingness to serve with us today.
[561.44 → 562.16] Todd, please.
[567.16 → 576.68] Good morning, everybody, and thank you for that warm welcome.
[576.98 → 580.80] It's a pleasure to be here on what I consider my annual visit to Ladder.
[580.80 → 610.78] Thank you for that warm welcome.
[610.80 → 613.36] It's God's flock that has come before him in prayer.
[613.58 → 614.08] Let us pray.
[621.76 → 626.32] Almighty God, this morning we join our voices with the saints departed,
[627.10 → 631.78] with the angels in heaven, and with your people all around the world,
[631.78 → 634.22] from all languages, tribes, and tongues,
[634.56 → 635.24] to say,
[635.24 → 638.06] worthy is the lamb who was slain,
[638.06 → 642.88] to receive glory, power, honour, and praise.
[643.84 → 646.64] God, as we come with gratitude before you,
[647.02 → 649.28] we ask that you might bless us
[649.28 → 651.60] with your word,
[652.44 → 653.38] given in sermon,
[654.00 → 655.56] in scripture, and in song,
[656.28 → 658.52] that we might hear the voice of our shepherd,
[658.52 → 660.70] grow in love for you,
[661.14 → 662.04] and for each other,
[662.26 → 663.68] and indeed for this whole world.
[664.24 → 665.72] And we ask this in Jesus' name.
[667.32 → 669.38] God greets his people with these words,
[669.50 → 671.02] grace and peace to you,
[671.08 → 672.08] from he who is,
[672.18 → 672.86] and who was,
[673.04 → 674.04] and who is to come.
[675.08 → 677.16] As God has blessed us,
[677.22 → 679.36] and greeted us with words of grace and peace,
[679.48 → 681.68] let us do that with our neighbours around us.
[681.68 → 711.66] Thank you.
[711.68 → 741.66] Thank you.
[741.66 → 749.26] The power of God that made the mountains rise,
[749.26 → 760.66] that spread the flowing seas abroad and built the lofty skies.
[760.66 → 772.66] We sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day.
[772.66 → 784.66] The moon shines full, earth is common, and all the stars obey.
[784.66 → 799.66] We sing the goodness of the Lord that filled the earth with food.
[799.66 → 811.66] He formed the creatures with His word, and then promised them good.
[811.66 → 823.66] Lord, how your wonders are displayed, where'er we turn our eyes.
[823.66 → 835.66] If we survey the ground we tread, or gaze upon the skies.
[835.66 → 851.66] There's not a plant or flower below, but makes your glories known.
[851.66 → 863.66] And clouds arise and tempests blow by honour from your throne.
[863.66 → 875.66] While all that borrows life from you is ever in your care.
[875.66 → 887.66] And everywhere that we can be, you've got a presence there.
[887.66 → 899.66] There's not a plant or flower below, but we can be, you've got a presence there.
[899.66 → 918.66] There's not a plant or flower below, but we can be, you've got a presence there.
[918.66 → 930.66] Holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[930.66 → 940.66] Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.
[940.66 → 952.66] Holy, holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.
[952.66 → 963.66] God in three persons bless the Trinity.
[963.66 → 966.66] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[966.66 → 972.66] Holy, holy, holy.
[972.66 → 977.66] All the saints adore Thee.
[977.66 → 982.66] Casting down their golden crowns
[982.66 → 988.66] around the glassy sea.
[988.66 → 1000.66] Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
[1001.96 → 1012.12] Blurt and art and evermore shall be.
[1018.66 → 1041.78] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
[1041.78 → 1052.78] All that works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[1052.78 → 1065.46] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
[1066.74 → 1076.28] God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[1076.28 → 1082.16] We ask you to please be seated at this time.
[1090.68 → 1096.74] The first scripture reading today is from Isaiah 42, verses 5 through 8.
[1096.74 → 1100.94] This is what God the Lord says, the creator of the heavens,
[1101.16 → 1106.76] who stretches out them, who spreads out the earth with all that springs out of it,
[1107.26 → 1111.38] who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it.
[1112.10 → 1114.20] I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness.
[1114.86 → 1116.30] I will take hold of your hand.
[1116.82 → 1121.00] I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people
[1121.00 → 1122.80] and a light for the Gentiles,
[1123.06 → 1125.26] to open the eyes of the blind,
[1125.68 → 1127.50] to free captives from prison,
[1128.10 → 1132.16] and to release from the dungeons those who sit in darkness.
[1132.92 → 1133.94] I am the Lord.
[1134.18 → 1135.50] That is my name.
[1135.82 → 1138.62] I will not yield my glory to another
[1138.62 → 1141.16] or my praise to idols.
[1142.12 → 1143.80] At this time we will be singing,
[1143.80 → 1145.36] Be unto your name.
[1151.00 → 1169.70] We are a moment,
[1170.84 → 1173.80] you are forever,
[1173.80 → 1177.80] Lord of the ages,
[1177.80 → 1182.60] God before died.
[1182.60 → 1186.10] We are a favour,
[1187.10 → 1190.28] you are eternal,
[1190.28 → 1194.42] love everlasting,
[1195.48 → 1200.60] reigning on high.
[1201.60 → 1205.10] Holy, holy,
[1205.10 → 1208.40] Lord God almighty,
[1208.40 → 1217.12] worthy is the Lamb who I stand.
[1217.84 → 1221.28] Highest praises,
[1221.28 → 1224.94] honour and glory
[1224.94 → 1231.84] be unto your name.
[1231.84 → 1238.84] Be unto your name.
[1241.14 → 1244.42] We are the broken,
[1244.42 → 1249.30] you are the healer,
[1249.30 → 1252.64] Jesus, Redeemer,
[1253.82 → 1256.58] mighty to save.
[1256.58 → 1261.88] You are the soul,
[1261.88 → 1265.88] we'll sing forever.
[1265.88 → 1265.96] We'll sing forever,
[1265.96 → 1270.16] I'll wait before you,
[1270.16 → 1275.78] blessing your name.
[1275.78 → 1279.96] Holy, holy,
[1279.96 → 1283.28] Lord God almighty,
[1283.28 → 1292.58] worthy is the Lamb who I stand.
[1292.58 → 1296.50] Highest praises,
[1296.50 → 1299.98] honour and glory
[1299.98 → 1306.58] be unto your name.
[1306.58 → 1313.58] be unto your name.
[1315.88 → 1317.96] Holy, holy,
[1317.96 → 1319.96] holy,
[1319.96 → 1322.96] Lord God almighty,
[1322.96 → 1330.96] worthy is the Lamb who I stand.
[1330.96 → 1336.34] the highest praises,
[1336.34 → 1340.26] honour and glory.
[1340.26 → 1347.26] be unto your name.
[1347.26 → 1355.26] be unto your name.
[1355.26 → 1355.56] Amen.
[1364.56 → 1364.96] Amen.
[1374.56 → 1376.88] We worship the God who is holy,
[1377.28 → 1377.64] holy,
[1377.78 → 1378.06] holy,
[1378.06 → 1379.84] as we sang,
[1380.56 → 1381.78] merciful and mighty,
[1381.78 → 1384.16] and we want to come before this holy God
[1384.16 → 1385.78] and ask for his mercy
[1385.78 → 1387.72] in a confession of sin.
[1387.72 → 1389.10] And we're going to do that
[1389.10 → 1391.92] with a responsive prayer
[1391.92 → 1393.76] based on Psalm 23,
[1393.76 → 1395.84] which I think you used last week as well.
[1396.24 → 1398.78] So I'm going to read the first line
[1398.78 → 1401.48] and I'll ask us together to respond.
[1402.34 → 1403.66] Let us confess our sins.
[1405.34 → 1406.96] The Lord is my shepherd,
[1407.46 → 1408.74] I shall not want.
[1408.74 → 1410.68] But, O Lord,
[1410.68 → 1413.66] I am consumed with wanting more.
[1414.94 → 1417.46] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[1417.86 → 1420.28] He leads me beside still waters.
[1420.60 → 1422.04] He restores my soul.
[1423.40 → 1423.84] But Jesus,
[1424.38 → 1426.40] other pastures seem greener.
[1427.22 → 1429.28] The waters aren't always still.
[1430.08 → 1431.84] My soul still thirsts.
[1433.34 → 1435.28] He leads me in right paths
[1435.28 → 1436.78] for his name's sake.
[1436.78 → 1438.54] Father,
[1438.78 → 1441.22] I long to be led by your Spirit,
[1441.88 → 1444.64] though I may complain along the path.
[1446.06 → 1448.88] Even though I walk through the darkest valley,
[1449.12 → 1450.18] I fear no evil,
[1450.70 → 1451.86] for you are with me,
[1452.20 → 1453.52] your rod and your staff.
[1453.76 → 1454.78] They comfort me.
[1455.86 → 1457.02] And yet, O God,
[1457.52 → 1459.14] I do sometimes fear.
[1460.10 → 1461.62] May I feel your presence,
[1462.26 → 1462.92] your comfort,
[1463.32 → 1465.18] and your forgiveness anew.
[1465.18 → 1468.92] You prepare a table before me
[1468.92 → 1470.38] in the presence of my enemies.
[1470.86 → 1472.08] You anoint my head with oil.
[1472.70 → 1474.46] My cup overflows.
[1476.20 → 1479.68] Sometimes I refuse to sit down at your table.
[1480.56 → 1484.48] Forgive me and help me to see your overflowing mercy.
[1484.48 → 1488.50] Surely goodness and mercy
[1488.50 → 1489.46] shall follow me
[1489.46 → 1491.12] all the days of my life,
[1491.32 → 1493.72] and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
[1493.72 → 1495.36] my whole life long.
[1496.40 → 1497.72] Forgive me, God,
[1497.96 → 1500.14] and take me into your house.
[1500.14 → 1509.10] Receive this assurance,
[1509.54 → 1511.22] also from Psalm 23.
[1513.88 → 1515.74] Even in the darkest valley,
[1516.30 → 1518.32] though death's shadow may threaten us,
[1518.72 → 1520.08] we need not fear,
[1520.40 → 1521.70] for the Lord is with us.
[1522.24 → 1524.72] God will comfort and shelter us.
[1524.72 → 1527.46] No one can snatch us
[1527.46 → 1529.04] out of the Lord's hand.
[1530.12 → 1531.28] And this is the good news
[1531.28 → 1532.14] we have declared.
[1532.36 → 1534.02] God loved us so deeply
[1534.02 → 1535.70] that he leads us
[1535.70 → 1536.80] out of the shadows
[1536.80 → 1538.72] to walk in the light of Christ
[1538.72 → 1541.02] in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1541.52 → 1542.34] We can rejoice
[1542.34 → 1544.14] in this new life.
[1545.46 → 1548.96] Our faithful God
[1548.96 → 1550.42] forgives our sins
[1550.42 → 1551.72] and raises us
[1551.72 → 1552.76] to new life.
[1552.76 → 1554.50] Thanks be to God.
[1555.16 → 1555.64] Amen.
[1559.00 → 1560.62] We join together in song.
[1567.62 → 1568.50] Please rise.
[1568.50 → 1595.26] When I fear my faith will fail,
[1595.26 → 1599.66] Christ will hold me fast.
[1599.66 → 1605.02] When the tempter would prevail,
[1605.56 → 1609.48] He will hold me fast.
[1609.90 → 1614.84] I could never keep my hope
[1614.84 → 1619.24] through life's fearful path,
[1619.82 → 1624.86] for my love is often cold.
[1624.86 → 1629.82] He must hold me fast.
[1629.82 → 1634.72] He will hold me fast.
[1634.72 → 1639.16] He will hold me fast.
[1639.16 → 1644.76] For my Saviour loves me so.
[1644.76 → 1650.36] He will hold me fast.
[1650.36 → 1654.34] He will hold me fast.
[1654.34 → 1670.86] are his delight, Christ will hold me fast. Precious in his holy sight, he will hold me
[1670.86 → 1690.02] fast. He will let my soul be lost, his promises shall last. For by him my subject calls, he
[1690.02 → 1707.02] will hold me fast. He will hold me fast. He will hold me fast. For my Saviour loves me
[1707.02 → 1714.38] so, he will hold me fast.
[1714.38 → 1734.38] For my life he bled and died, Christ will hold me fast. Justice has been satisfied, he
[1734.38 → 1750.38] will hold me fast. Race with him to endless night. He will hold me fast. Till all faith
[1750.38 → 1769.38] is turned to side, when he comes and asks, he will hold me fast. He will hold me fast.
[1769.38 → 1789.38] For my Saviour loves me so, he will hold me fast. He will hold me fast. He will hold me
[1789.38 → 1804.38] fast. For my Saviour loves me so, he will hold me fast.
[1804.38 → 1806.38] Amen.
[1819.38 → 1844.38] The kids are welcome to go to Sunday School. And we turn our attention and open our ears
[1844.38 → 1851.38] to God's word, which comes to us this morning from the Gospel of John, chapter 10. I'm reading
[1851.38 → 1862.38] verses 1 to 18. Hear what the Holy Spirit has to say to Ladder Christian Reformed Church this
[1862.38 → 1867.38] morning. John 10. Jesus is speaking.
[1867.38 → 1877.38] Very truly, I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter by the sheep pen...
[1877.38 → 1882.38] Let me try, let me start that again. I have a different text in front of me with a different translation. I'm
[1882.38 → 1886.38] going to read it from the screen so that we're all on the same page.
[1886.38 → 1896.38] Very truly, I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.
[1896.38 → 1911.38] The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and he leads them out.
[1911.38 → 1928.38] When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice, but they will never follow a stranger. In fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.
[1928.38 → 1940.38] Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.
[1940.38 → 1942.38] Therefore, Jesus said again,
[1942.38 → 1950.38] Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.
[1950.38 → 1958.38] I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out and find pasture.
[1958.38 → 1967.38] The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.
[1967.38 → 1973.38] I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[1973.38 → 1982.38] The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and he runs away.
[1982.38 → 1990.38] Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he's a hired hand, and he cares nothing for the sheep.
[1990.38 → 2003.38] I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me just as the father knows me. And I know the father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
[2003.38 → 2014.38] I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They, too, will listen to my voice and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
[2014.38 → 2025.38] The reason my father loves me is that I lay down my life only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.
[2025.38 → 2034.38] I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my father.
[2034.38 → 2039.38] This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Amen.
[2039.38 → 2056.38] So in John 10, Jesus is speaking of sheep and shepherds and sheep folds. He speaks of wolves and flocks and hired hands.
[2056.38 → 2061.38] And his listeners actually have trouble understanding him.
[2061.38 → 2076.38] In verse six, which we read, this figure of speech, sheep, sheep fold, shepherds, et cetera, Jesus uses with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
[2076.38 → 2083.38] What about you? Do you understand? Do you understand these figures of speech?
[2083.38 → 2090.38] They say a picture is worth a thousand words, right? How often do we see these pictures though?
[2090.38 → 2109.38] These are pictures drawn from a world of pastures and flocks, spoken to people who lived a long time ago in a world where milking goats and spinning wool and birthing lambs was daily routine.
[2109.38 → 2113.38] Maybe that makes sense for some of you.
[2113.38 → 2124.38] And I know Ladder Delta is a bit more army than most Christian reformed churches in the area, but it's definitely not the world's most of us live in, at least not anymore. Right?
[2124.38 → 2130.38] My wife and I were on a tour a couple of years ago to Israel Jordan.
[2130.38 → 2133.38] In fact, Pastor Jason was on that tour with us.
[2133.38 → 2143.38] And one day we were with our group on the hill, in the hills close to where the Jordan River flows into the briny waters of the Dead Sea.
[2143.38 → 2158.38] And we saw a few, a few shepherd boys tending their flock in the late afternoon, using staffs to guide the goats and the sheep into hillside caves, which you can see on your, on your right.
[2158.38 → 2167.38] These are caves in the rocks where the sheep would be gathered at night to protect the flock from jackals and from wild dogs.
[2167.38 → 2173.38] And these boys were armed with slingshots to protect their flock.
[2173.38 → 2176.38] No kidding. It was like something right out of the Bible.
[2176.38 → 2179.38] Thy rod and staff, they comfort me.
[2179.38 → 2191.38] And I, and I overheard a few people in our group who were from suburban Toronto say that this was the very first time in their life that they had ever seen a shepherd.
[2191.38 → 2193.38] No surprise.
[2193.38 → 2202.38] This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them.
[2202.38 → 2207.38] I know some of you know farming, but most of us don't.
[2207.38 → 2210.38] What do we do?
[2210.38 → 2216.38] We who live in a city like Kelowna or Delta and suburban Vancouver.
[2216.38 → 2222.38] What do we do with these word pictures of sheep and shepherds?
[2222.38 → 2232.38] Now critics of the Bible, of which there are many, and in my line of work, I have to read them and I talk to them on campus often.
[2232.38 → 2241.38] Critics of the Bible will complain that scripture is full of what are called dead metaphors.
[2241.38 → 2251.38] These are metaphors, figures of speech, word pictures about God that are, well, dead.
[2251.38 → 2257.38] They're not relevant anymore to people who live in the 21st century.
[2257.38 → 2262.38] You know, we worship God as a king, but we live in a democracy.
[2262.38 → 2265.38] We call God our Lord.
[2265.38 → 2270.38] But most of us don't like thinking of ourselves as servants or slaves, do we?
[2270.38 → 2279.38] more downtown than who are designated sins in the north?
[2279.38 → 2282.38] Like Mellor and Milo should be chapter low.
[2282.38 → 2283.38] Like, we call it Joseph.
[2283.38 → 2285.38] Perfectly, it goes to Kenneth Hay, with our unknowns.
[2285.38 → 2289.38] While we were treating animals another, it is a largely measured and bothers.
[2289.38 → 2292.38] It's truly that is Sinai.
[2292.38 → 2299.16] I recall a conversation a few years ago with a student on campus who said to me,
[2299.16 → 2307.50] how can you believe the Bible when it's like a thousand years old and totally out of date?
[2308.42 → 2312.66] And I had to tell the student the Bible is actually 2,000 years old.
[2315.16 → 2316.50] Dead metaphors?
[2316.50 → 2332.56] I think we should never underestimate the Word of God, nor the power of the Spirit to make those old words live and live powerfully in us.
[2333.56 → 2341.70] Let's not be so quick to assume dead metaphors in the Bible, including the Good Shepherd.
[2341.70 → 2350.52] It was about 20 years ago, I was at a conference in Montreal on church music and liturgy,
[2351.10 → 2356.58] and it was led by a well-known Scottish hymn writer by the name of John Bell.
[2357.70 → 2367.68] And Bell told us about his experiences as a parish pastor in an inner-city neighbourhood in Glasgow, Scotland.
[2367.68 → 2377.26] And he said that often on a Sunday morning, a number of prostitutes would wander into the congregation and sit at the back of the church.
[2377.96 → 2380.90] They'd warm up after a night on the streets.
[2381.50 → 2386.84] Some of them were searching for some compassion, maybe some forgiveness, too.
[2387.90 → 2389.98] These women were regulars.
[2389.98 → 2394.38] I know that wouldn't happen here in Ladder, but it happens in inner-city churches.
[2394.86 → 2397.52] Drug addicts and prostitutes will wander into the church.
[2398.54 → 2407.54] Now, Bell told us that on one weekend, one of the young women, one of the sex workers who was a regular attender at his service,
[2408.38 → 2411.82] was killed by one of her clients.
[2411.82 → 2416.86] And the other prostitutes were deeply shaken by this.
[2417.76 → 2426.28] And they approached Bell a few weeks later, and they asked him if they could honour her memory in some way.
[2427.58 → 2429.12] And Bell, as the pastor, said,
[2429.64 → 2430.36] Yes, of course.
[2430.78 → 2432.00] What are you thinking?
[2432.00 → 2445.98] And remarkably, this group of sex workers had pooled their money together with the hope of purchasing a brand-new stained-glass window for this old Presbyterian church.
[2447.22 → 2452.66] And guess what picture they wanted on that stained-glass window?
[2455.22 → 2456.76] The Good Shepherd.
[2457.44 → 2459.56] Jesus, the Good Shepherd.
[2459.56 → 2471.82] These were women who had lived their whole lives, short, hard lives, in the gray, damp, concrete world of a British industrial city.
[2472.76 → 2476.92] And they wanted Jesus tenderly holding a lamb.
[2478.38 → 2484.00] Their hearts were breaking for a Good Shepherd, for green pastures.
[2486.00 → 2489.04] This is not a dead metaphor.
[2489.56 → 2492.12] This is very much alive.
[2492.70 → 2503.34] And by the power of the Spirit, old scriptural pictures like this can still speak powerfully to people in the 21st century who don't farm,
[2504.02 → 2511.64] who use smartphones, and move fast, who live in cities, and have never, ever seen a sheep being shorn.
[2511.64 → 2517.74] Psalm 23 is still the most popular psalm in the Bible, right?
[2519.00 → 2520.16] The Good Shepherd.
[2520.78 → 2521.86] God is the shepherd.
[2522.08 → 2524.14] It's not a dead metaphor.
[2524.86 → 2526.28] It's very much alive.
[2526.28 → 2529.52] And it begs this question.
[2530.80 → 2532.80] Why is this image so powerful?
[2532.92 → 2534.64] Why does it resonate in our hearts?
[2536.46 → 2539.10] I think there are a number of reasons why.
[2539.48 → 2544.94] And I think a big reason is that this picture of the Good Shepherd, it resonates.
[2544.94 → 2555.64] It responds to some of these deep fears and longings we've had ever since we were children and have them still as we're adults.
[2556.50 → 2565.90] This childlike yearning, desire to be loved by someone good, even when we've been bad.
[2565.90 → 2580.48] And this childlike desire to be cared for and protected and cherished by someone strong, mighty, in a world that feels big and scary and sometimes dark.
[2581.10 → 2587.96] No matter how old we get, we never outgrow those childlike fears and desires.
[2587.96 → 2599.80] You probably know this, but there are lots of studies that show that a baby can recognize its mother's voice in utero.
[2601.36 → 2603.54] And we've probably all had those experiences.
[2604.02 → 2615.88] Well, there's also studies that say that from the age of two months, a child can recognize its parent's voice, even when that parent is out of sight, like in another room.
[2615.88 → 2624.64] We've probably all had that experience where we've come home, and the babysitter is holding one of our kids and the kid's screaming, right?
[2624.78 → 2626.32] The babysitter's frazzled.
[2626.68 → 2629.72] And we walk through the door, and we say our child's name.
[2631.26 → 2632.82] And the baby stops crying.
[2632.98 → 2634.94] The toddler stops whining, right?
[2636.86 → 2639.74] He calls his own sheep by name.
[2640.74 → 2642.12] And he leads them out.
[2642.12 → 2643.12] He calls out.
[2643.12 → 2645.38] I am the good shepherd, Jesus says.
[2646.06 → 2648.72] I know my sheep, and they know me.
[2649.18 → 2651.46] And they listen to my voice.
[2652.72 → 2661.14] No matter how far we run, no matter how far we wander, the good shepherd knows our name.
[2661.84 → 2666.56] And he calls out to us like a mom or a dad speaks to their children.
[2666.56 → 2667.72] And we hear him.
[2668.42 → 2670.68] And his voice can still our fears.
[2671.40 → 2673.22] Lets us know that we aren't alone.
[2674.42 → 2685.22] Into these deep, deep fears and worries and yearnings that we carry from childhood to be loved and cared for and protected and cherished.
[2685.22 → 2703.56] The picture of the good shepherd speaks of a God who is, as we sang earlier, merciful and mighty, strong and tender, who leads us to green pastures, still waters where we can rest, and whose rod and staff hold at bay.
[2703.56 → 2709.74] Those wolves that came to us when we were children in our beds at night.
[2710.70 → 2714.70] Those wolves that still come to us when we're adults.
[2715.78 → 2719.04] So that we can, in peace, lie down and sleep.
[2720.06 → 2725.20] For in you alone, O Lord, you alone make us dwell in safety.
[2725.20 → 2727.64] This is our good shepherd.
[2729.10 → 2732.04] Not a dead metaphor.
[2735.98 → 2741.40] Now, it could be easy to get a little bit sentimental about this picture.
[2741.82 → 2742.78] And often we do.
[2743.18 → 2748.94] And if you look at artwork of the good shepherd, often it seems a little bit, well, a little bit kitschy, right?
[2748.94 → 2758.42] We can sentimentalize this, but we shouldn't because, really, most of us have had that worry.
[2758.78 → 2762.26] Again, a worry from deep childhood, I think.
[2762.62 → 2769.36] A worry that no matter how good this shepherd might be, are we really part of his flock?
[2770.64 → 2772.38] Is he really our shepherd?
[2772.38 → 2778.50] We have this lurking fear in us that maybe we're not part of the shepherd's flock.
[2780.36 → 2784.80] Now, of course, a good shepherd wants to save this little lamb.
[2785.84 → 2786.52] Look at her.
[2787.82 → 2788.56] She's pure.
[2789.20 → 2790.40] Come on, she's adorable.
[2791.34 → 2792.88] Totally lovable.
[2795.32 → 2797.04] But you don't look like that, do you?
[2798.48 → 2799.28] I don't.
[2799.28 → 2804.56] No, we look more like this, right?
[2807.82 → 2813.44] I worked as a student pastor for a summer on one of these northern Scottish islands,
[2814.30 → 2819.06] a rural community where most of the congregation were sheep farmers.
[2819.30 → 2821.08] Up there, they call them crofters.
[2821.08 → 2826.82] And believe me, when I was making a pastoral visit to one of these crofters,
[2826.82 → 2832.50] I could smell their sheep farm about a kilometre before I could see the farmhouse.
[2833.76 → 2834.62] Because sheep are dirty.
[2836.66 → 2837.60] We're dirty.
[2838.96 → 2844.12] All of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[2844.12 → 2847.94] Scripture tells us what we know in our hearts is true.
[2848.46 → 2849.92] And we hide from this truth.
[2850.54 → 2851.96] But deep down, we know it.
[2852.02 → 2853.54] We know we look like this.
[2854.84 → 2856.36] Can we still be loved?
[2859.16 → 2860.32] Here are the wolves.
[2861.04 → 2862.80] They smell our fear like blood.
[2863.80 → 2866.50] And they growl doubt all around us.
[2866.50 → 2872.30] This is why the good shepherd picture is so powerful.
[2872.86 → 2874.66] Not sentimental here.
[2875.70 → 2880.48] The good shepherd doesn't love clean, white little lambs.
[2881.34 → 2883.82] He loves sheep that look like this.
[2884.58 → 2888.98] And he carries them back to the sheepfold where they can be safe.
[2888.98 → 2893.24] The great reformer Martin Luther said,
[2893.76 → 2898.84] Mother love is stronger than the filth and scabbiness on a child.
[2899.54 → 2904.94] And so the love of God toward us is stronger than the dirt that clings to us.
[2905.94 → 2911.90] This is the answer to that deep fear inside of us that we can't be loved.
[2912.84 → 2917.14] The good shepherd's love is such that he doesn't lay down his life
[2917.14 → 2919.70] for cute, fluffy little lambs.
[2920.20 → 2924.68] He lays down his life for sheep, for us that look like this.
[2926.78 → 2931.22] That's why those prostitutes in Glasgow were in church on a Sunday morning
[2931.22 → 2933.02] after a night on the streets.
[2933.80 → 2935.10] They knew this truth.
[2936.22 → 2937.20] We should too.
[2938.78 → 2941.00] I am the good shepherd, Jesus says.
[2941.42 → 2944.68] I lay down my life for my sheep,
[2945.04 → 2946.70] only to take it up again.
[2947.70 → 2949.82] Our shepherd laid down his life
[2949.82 → 2953.40] because of our dirtiness and was raised to life
[2953.40 → 2954.76] so that we may live.
[2955.34 → 2958.68] And so we are eternally loved by God in Christ,
[2959.30 → 2961.36] kept safe from the wolves,
[2962.20 → 2964.76] eternally secure in his love.
[2965.20 → 2966.32] As we just sang,
[2967.98 → 2969.78] Jesus says later in the chapter,
[2969.78 → 2971.50] I know my sheep.
[2972.20 → 2975.36] No one will ever snatch them out of my hand.
[2975.36 → 2976.94] We just sang that.
[2977.30 → 2979.02] It's one of my favourite verses in the Bible.
[2979.62 → 2983.50] No one will ever snatch us out of the shepherd's hand.
[2985.46 → 2988.34] Our good shepherd washes us clean,
[2988.74 → 2990.04] keeps us safe forever,
[2990.04 → 2990.58] forever.
[2990.58 → 2993.32] Such is this strong love,
[2993.50 → 2997.18] which we've known in the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[2997.38 → 2998.54] And for this grace,
[2999.28 → 3000.38] we thank God.
[3000.38 → 3005.04] I have one more thing to say in closing.
[3005.04 → 3011.48] And if I warned us earlier that we shouldn't be sentimental about the picture of the good shepherd,
[3011.90 → 3015.52] here I want to warn us not to get comfortable with it.
[3015.52 → 3021.56] Because there's a world of difference between being comforted by our good shepherd,
[3021.56 → 3022.74] which we should be,
[3023.64 → 3026.42] and then getting comfy with the idea.
[3027.18 → 3028.70] We're not to get comfy
[3028.70 → 3031.78] because we are called to do something
[3031.78 → 3036.04] in response to what God has graciously done for us.
[3036.04 → 3037.40] Jesus says,
[3037.56 → 3040.90] I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold.
[3041.14 → 3042.82] I must bring them also.
[3043.98 → 3045.76] They too will listen to my voice,
[3045.86 → 3048.46] and there will be one flock and one shepherd.
[3050.46 → 3052.28] God, the good shepherd,
[3052.98 → 3054.10] is on a move.
[3054.56 → 3055.32] He's on a mission.
[3055.86 → 3059.80] He's scouring the hillsides for lost sheep,
[3059.86 → 3061.22] and he's calling out to them
[3061.22 → 3063.84] just like he's called out to us
[3063.84 → 3065.28] to come to him.
[3066.18 → 3068.58] And he searches for them there
[3068.58 → 3071.60] through us here.
[3072.92 → 3075.34] Now here you have to track with me
[3075.34 → 3076.78] because I'm going to do something
[3076.78 → 3079.02] I'm not supposed to do as a preacher.
[3079.30 → 3081.00] I'm going to mix metaphors.
[3081.68 → 3083.32] And we really shouldn't do this.
[3083.40 → 3084.00] In fact, I was,
[3084.38 → 3085.64] just two weeks ago,
[3085.70 → 3087.68] I was marking papers
[3087.68 → 3089.78] because I teach a class at UBC.
[3089.78 → 3091.46] This year I taught
[3091.46 → 3093.10] an introduction to world religions.
[3093.80 → 3094.90] First year class,
[3095.04 → 3096.22] and I'm marking their papers.
[3096.74 → 3098.44] First year papers are not very good.
[3098.92 → 3099.06] Okay?
[3099.64 → 3100.86] And on a few of the papers,
[3100.98 → 3102.70] I wrote to the students
[3102.70 → 3103.84] as they're making an argument.
[3104.30 → 3105.96] Don't mix metaphors
[3105.96 → 3107.32] when you're making an argument
[3107.32 → 3109.16] because it's super confusing, right?
[3109.90 → 3110.88] But I'm going to do it.
[3112.26 → 3113.14] I'm going to do it
[3113.14 → 3114.20] because Jesus does it.
[3114.28 → 3115.14] He does it in John.
[3115.28 → 3116.12] And maybe you noticed
[3116.12 → 3117.02] when we read this.
[3117.02 → 3120.88] Jesus is the good shepherd, right?
[3121.98 → 3122.78] That's clear.
[3123.96 → 3125.90] A few verses earlier, though,
[3126.04 → 3127.48] he's not the good shepherd.
[3128.30 → 3131.16] He's the gate for the sheepfold.
[3133.32 → 3133.62] Uh-oh.
[3134.30 → 3136.68] Jesus is mixing metaphors.
[3137.86 → 3139.32] Don't get confused, though.
[3139.32 → 3142.96] So if Jesus is no longer the shepherd
[3142.96 → 3143.74] but the gate,
[3144.26 → 3145.60] who's the shepherd?
[3150.88 → 3153.52] The person who enters by the gate
[3153.52 → 3156.04] is the shepherd of the sheep.
[3159.22 → 3160.26] I'm looking at you.
[3161.86 → 3162.46] Uh-oh.
[3162.46 → 3165.96] We've entered by the gate
[3165.96 → 3168.06] that is Jesus Christ, right?
[3168.70 → 3169.36] We're baptized.
[3169.76 → 3170.48] We have faith.
[3170.60 → 3171.76] We're here on a Sunday morning.
[3172.52 → 3174.40] We live in Jesus Christ
[3174.40 → 3175.24] and his salvation.
[3175.46 → 3176.68] We've entered through the gate
[3176.68 → 3181.22] that makes us shepherds
[3181.22 → 3184.72] called to share God's love
[3184.72 → 3186.48] with others,
[3186.90 → 3189.46] to lead sheep to green pastures
[3189.46 → 3192.08] and still waters.
[3193.64 → 3195.64] Now, leaders in the church
[3195.64 → 3197.14] are especially called
[3197.14 → 3198.08] to be shepherds.
[3198.14 → 3199.32] In fact, that's what the word
[3199.32 → 3200.20] pastor means.
[3200.36 → 3201.12] I don't know if you knew that.
[3201.30 → 3202.68] The word pastor means shepherd
[3202.68 → 3203.86] in Latin.
[3204.72 → 3206.30] But all of us
[3206.30 → 3207.60] are shepherds.
[3207.78 → 3209.40] We can't delegate this
[3209.40 → 3210.88] onto Pastor Jason, okay?
[3211.16 → 3212.44] Especially because he's not here.
[3213.46 → 3215.48] We're all called to be shepherds,
[3215.96 → 3217.12] to share with others
[3217.12 → 3218.06] the good news
[3218.06 → 3219.34] of what God has done
[3219.34 → 3220.12] for us in Jesus,
[3220.32 → 3221.48] to share with others
[3221.48 → 3223.00] the good news
[3223.00 → 3225.28] of the good shepherd,
[3225.84 → 3226.90] to comfort them
[3226.90 → 3228.64] as we've been comforted.
[3229.30 → 3230.00] And I know,
[3230.10 → 3231.20] I know this seems
[3231.20 → 3232.30] like a daunting role.
[3232.98 → 3233.92] Christian Reformed folk
[3233.92 → 3234.80] were not comfortable
[3234.80 → 3235.68] with that idea.
[3236.14 → 3237.34] The pastor's the shepherd?
[3237.90 → 3238.74] Yeah, that's fine.
[3239.44 → 3240.96] But us as shepherds
[3240.96 → 3243.08] seems a little scary,
[3243.16 → 3243.64] doesn't it?
[3243.98 → 3245.14] I know it is.
[3245.34 → 3245.92] I know it is.
[3245.92 → 3246.82] It can feel daunting.
[3247.78 → 3249.12] In fact, I have a friend
[3249.12 → 3249.90] who's a pastor
[3249.90 → 3252.40] who told me some years ago
[3252.40 → 3253.92] when he was preaching
[3253.92 → 3254.74] on John 10
[3254.74 → 3255.66] and was saying
[3255.66 → 3257.38] that his congregation
[3257.38 → 3258.48] kind of rebelled
[3258.48 → 3259.88] at the idea
[3259.88 → 3260.94] that they too
[3260.94 → 3261.84] were shepherds,
[3262.12 → 3263.14] little shepherds
[3263.14 → 3264.24] under the work
[3264.24 → 3265.02] of the good shepherd.
[3265.82 → 3266.84] So he struck
[3266.84 → 3267.86] a compromise with them.
[3268.26 → 3268.46] He said,
[3268.52 → 3268.66] all right,
[3268.68 → 3269.92] I'm not going to call you shepherds.
[3270.12 → 3271.46] I'm going to call you sheepdogs.
[3272.14 → 3273.28] How does that sound?
[3274.42 → 3275.76] And I actually like this image.
[3276.10 → 3276.82] I wonder if Jesus
[3276.82 → 3277.52] would have used it
[3277.52 → 3278.56] if they'd had sheepdogs
[3278.56 → 3279.22] back then.
[3279.78 → 3282.10] When I was in the Scottish parish,
[3283.04 → 3284.64] I remember seeing the shepherds
[3284.64 → 3285.64] use sheepdogs
[3285.64 → 3288.46] to marshal their flocks.
[3289.32 → 3292.40] And with just hand signs
[3292.40 → 3293.44] and whistles,
[3293.94 → 3295.58] maybe you've seen this,
[3295.94 → 3297.34] with whistles and hand signs,
[3297.82 → 3298.58] these sheepdogs
[3298.58 → 3300.04] sheepdogs would move
[3300.04 → 3301.52] all around the pastures
[3301.52 → 3303.74] and they'd nip the heels
[3303.74 → 3305.84] of these errant sheep
[3305.84 → 3307.54] and bring them back
[3307.54 → 3308.34] into the flock
[3308.34 → 3309.66] where they would be safe,
[3310.38 → 3311.72] guide them together
[3311.72 → 3313.92] back to the sheep pen
[3313.92 → 3315.50] where they would spend the night
[3315.50 → 3317.04] or find water or food.
[3317.40 → 3319.60] It's quite remarkable to see.
[3319.60 → 3323.14] So call yourself a sheepdog
[3323.14 → 3324.12] if you want.
[3325.20 → 3326.02] Think of yourself
[3326.02 → 3326.86] as a shepherd
[3326.86 → 3328.56] if you want to be more biblical.
[3329.78 → 3331.54] The task is the same
[3331.54 → 3334.14] and the times we're in
[3334.14 → 3335.20] are desperate
[3335.20 → 3337.52] because the hillsides
[3337.52 → 3339.80] are full of lost sheep.
[3341.12 → 3342.82] Studies out of the United States
[3342.82 → 3343.98] are referring to
[3343.98 → 3344.42] what's called
[3344.42 → 3345.84] the Great Dechurching,
[3346.54 → 3348.18] this massive exodus
[3348.18 → 3349.32] of people
[3349.32 → 3351.28] out of the pews.
[3351.98 → 3354.70] Not because they're angry necessarily,
[3354.94 → 3356.40] not because they're disgusted,
[3356.40 → 3358.72] they just drift away
[3358.72 → 3360.48] and get lost.
[3361.40 → 3362.46] You know these people.
[3363.54 → 3365.14] Some of them are your kids
[3365.14 → 3366.46] or your grandkids.
[3367.14 → 3368.52] Some of them are your friends.
[3368.84 → 3369.96] Maybe some of them are you
[3369.96 → 3371.86] and you're here this morning.
[3373.62 → 3375.00] The Good Shepherd
[3375.00 → 3377.00] is calling out to them
[3377.00 → 3378.42] through us,
[3379.04 → 3379.40] little shepherds,
[3380.26 → 3381.24] his sheepdogs,
[3382.12 → 3383.36] seeking to rescue them
[3383.36 → 3384.40] from the wolves,
[3385.06 → 3385.86] calling to them
[3385.86 → 3387.18] to come to the gate
[3387.18 → 3389.16] and there find life,
[3389.98 → 3391.10] life in the full.
[3392.96 → 3394.54] I have other sheep
[3394.54 → 3396.64] that are not of this sheepfold,
[3396.98 → 3397.74] Jesus says.
[3398.56 → 3400.00] I must bring them also.
[3400.88 → 3402.36] They will listen to my voice.
[3403.34 → 3404.56] There will be one flock
[3404.56 → 3405.82] and one shepherd.
[3407.74 → 3409.20] I'll close with this anecdote.
[3409.64 → 3411.14] I was thinking of this verse
[3411.14 → 3412.90] and this whole idea
[3412.90 → 3414.10] of being a shepherd a lot
[3414.10 → 3414.94] this past year,
[3414.94 → 3416.08] which is one of the reasons
[3416.08 → 3417.44] why I wanted to preach
[3417.44 → 3418.62] on this passage.
[3419.96 → 3422.14] I'd had a few pastoral conversations
[3422.14 → 3423.32] with a young man,
[3423.36 → 3424.40] a student at UBC
[3424.40 → 3427.64] who's from Pakistan
[3427.64 → 3430.74] and he's Muslim,
[3431.14 → 3431.76] of course,
[3431.82 → 3433.02] because he's from Pakistan.
[3433.40 → 3435.22] But he's discovering Jesus
[3435.22 → 3437.16] while he's at university
[3437.16 → 3438.76] and these conversations
[3438.76 → 3439.50] I have with him
[3439.50 → 3440.24] are remarkable.
[3441.54 → 3443.42] And the reason why
[3443.42 → 3445.28] he's coming to know Jesus
[3445.28 → 3447.12] is simply because
[3447.12 → 3449.06] a couple of boys
[3449.06 → 3451.04] in his residence
[3451.04 → 3452.54] are sheepdogs
[3452.54 → 3455.80] and they nipped his heels
[3455.80 → 3457.32] enough times
[3457.32 → 3459.12] by inviting him to church
[3459.12 → 3460.78] that he said,
[3460.86 → 3461.20] all right, fine,
[3461.22 → 3461.98] I'm going to go to church
[3461.98 → 3463.80] and get these guys off my back.
[3463.80 → 3465.46] So he did.
[3466.46 → 3467.62] And while he's at church,
[3467.72 → 3468.72] the spirit begins
[3468.72 → 3469.62] to work at him
[3469.62 → 3472.38] and he discovers
[3472.38 → 3473.86] Jesus Christ.
[3474.72 → 3475.84] And he's at the point
[3475.84 → 3476.48] right now
[3476.48 → 3478.50] where he's considering
[3478.50 → 3479.38] being baptized,
[3480.26 → 3481.68] which is amazing.
[3482.52 → 3483.76] But just to be clear,
[3484.36 → 3485.62] when he's baptized,
[3485.84 → 3486.68] he will never,
[3486.94 → 3487.92] ever be able to go home
[3487.92 → 3490.60] because apostasy laws
[3490.60 → 3491.36] in Pakistan
[3491.36 → 3492.46] will put him
[3492.46 → 3493.72] and his family at risk.
[3495.60 → 3496.56] That's remarkable,
[3496.96 → 3497.42] isn't it?
[3498.62 → 3499.56] And I've asked him
[3499.56 → 3500.62] in conversation,
[3501.08 → 3501.22] you know,
[3501.26 → 3502.58] what is it about Christianity
[3502.58 → 3504.32] that attracts you?
[3504.42 → 3506.88] And he describes it
[3506.88 → 3508.90] like this,
[3509.26 → 3511.18] simply but wonderfully.
[3512.92 → 3513.22] He says,
[3513.94 → 3514.92] what I realize
[3514.92 → 3516.78] is that Jesus shows us
[3516.78 → 3518.18] what God is like,
[3518.86 → 3520.24] that he's strong
[3520.24 → 3521.32] and he's tender
[3521.32 → 3523.14] and he's merciful
[3523.14 → 3524.98] and in Jesus
[3524.98 → 3526.62] he's forgiven my sins.
[3527.96 → 3529.84] And he's describing God
[3529.84 → 3531.44] as the good shepherd,
[3532.18 → 3532.56] right?
[3534.46 → 3536.24] He's heard the voice
[3536.24 → 3537.42] of the good shepherd
[3537.42 → 3538.10] calling him
[3538.10 → 3540.36] and he's coming home
[3540.36 → 3542.16] and he's doing this
[3542.16 → 3544.30] because of sheepdogs,
[3544.90 → 3545.80] little shepherds
[3545.80 → 3547.86] in his university residence
[3547.86 → 3550.16] who just invited him
[3550.16 → 3551.06] to church.
[3555.22 → 3556.62] Do you know what image
[3556.62 → 3557.62] the Quran
[3557.62 → 3559.96] does not use
[3559.96 → 3561.04] of God?
[3561.04 → 3565.70] In fact,
[3565.78 → 3566.26] this image
[3566.26 → 3567.68] is forbidden
[3567.68 → 3568.82] in Islam
[3568.82 → 3570.72] because it's derogatory.
[3572.56 → 3573.68] It's the good shepherd.
[3575.06 → 3576.84] It's explicitly forbidden.
[3580.98 → 3581.96] They don't have
[3581.96 → 3582.56] the good shepherd.
[3584.02 → 3585.20] This young man
[3585.20 → 3586.84] knows the good shepherd now.
[3587.96 → 3588.86] We know
[3588.86 → 3590.04] the good shepherd.
[3591.04 → 3591.98] Jesus says,
[3592.34 → 3594.28] I am the good shepherd.
[3594.64 → 3595.80] I know my sheep
[3595.80 → 3597.68] and my sheep know me.
[3598.66 → 3600.18] And may this good shepherd
[3600.18 → 3601.78] comfort our hearts
[3601.78 → 3603.40] and overcome our fears
[3603.40 → 3605.02] and indeed
[3605.02 → 3606.22] may he nudge us
[3606.22 → 3607.54] out of the sheepfold
[3607.54 → 3609.28] onto the hillsides
[3609.28 → 3610.46] as we share
[3610.46 → 3611.42] this good news
[3611.42 → 3613.28] with the lost sheep
[3613.28 → 3614.06] around us.
[3614.92 → 3615.26] Amen.
[3621.04 → 3633.68] Please rise.
[3633.68 → 3633.74] Please rise.
[3633.74 → 3635.12] praise God.
[3635.12 → 3636.72] less hounds are
[3636.72 → 3637.02] there.
[3637.02 → 3637.38] Lord,
[3637.38 → 3638.52] may this be
[3638.52 → 3638.94] candid,
[3638.94 → 3639.14] may this be
[3639.14 → 3640.96] more Halloween.
[3642.40 → 3642.92] You just have UUU,
[3642.92 → 3644.50] may this be
[3644.50 → 3644.68] special women
[3644.68 → 3646.98] to Janeiro
[3646.98 → 3647.50] and an
[3647.50 → 3649.12] awesome
[3649.12 → 3650.66] people
[3650.66 → 3650.92] on Me.
[3650.98 → 3651.70] On the right
[3651.70 → 3652.80] day,
[3652.80 → 3653.14] three others
[3653.14 → 3655.26] may this
[3655.32 → 3656.50] gotta say.
[3656.50 → 3658.10] That may be
[3658.10 → 3658.86] to you
[3658.86 → 3660.26] as you
[3660.26 → 3680.68] Good Shepherd of my soul, come dwell within me.
[3680.68 → 3688.88] Take all I am and mould your likeness in me.
[3688.88 → 3697.26] Before the cross of Christ, this is my sacrifice.
[3697.80 → 3702.66] A life laid down and ready to follow.
[3706.24 → 3712.90] The troubled find their peace in true surrender.
[3712.90 → 3721.64] Their prisoners, their release from chains of anger.
[3723.18 → 3731.06] In springs of living grace, I find a resting place.
[3731.06 → 3736.74] To rise refreshed, eternal to follow.
[3736.74 → 3748.76] I'll walk this narrow road with Christ before me.
[3748.76 → 3757.58] Where thorns and vessels grow, and gores and spare me.
[3758.26 → 3766.62] Though doubted and denied, He never leaves my side.
[3766.62 → 3772.48] But lifts my head and calls me to follow.
[3772.48 → 3783.10] And when my days are gone, my strength is failing.
[3783.10 → 3792.10] He'll carry me along through depths unfailing.
[3792.10 → 3801.10] Their struggles overcome as journey just begun.
[3801.10 → 3808.10] To search Christ's depths and ever to follow.
[3808.10 → 3816.10] To search Christ's depths and ever to follow.
[3816.10 → 3839.46] To search Christ's depths and ever to follow.
[3839.46 → 3849.18] Before the congregational meeting, we'll have the collection for the campus, our CRC campus
[3849.18 → 3852.90] ministry, and we'll do that at this time.
[3852.90 → 3864.98] Actually, Mel, could I just say a few words?
[3864.98 → 3866.30] Yeah, thanks.
[3866.30 → 3871.60] You could keep playing, but then I'd have to talk really loud.
[3871.60 → 3873.76] It's fine if you want to collect while I'm speaking, that's fine.
[3873.76 → 3877.14] I just wanted to say thank you to the congregation.
[3877.14 → 3881.80] It's great timing that the offering is being taken on the Sunday that I'm here.
[3881.80 → 3883.96] Providential.
[3883.96 → 3886.98] I'm grateful for the support of Ladder CRC over the years.
[3886.98 → 3891.92] You've been a faithful supporter of my work in the Okanagan.
[3891.92 → 3897.22] In fact, now I can say our work, not just because it's our work as a church denomination,
[3897.22 → 3899.38] but because I also have a colleague.
[3899.38 → 3903.22] And this is possible because of the gifts of churches like yours.
[3903.22 → 3908.52] This is the first year when we have an expanded campus ministry.
[3908.52 → 3915.98] One day a week, I have a young seminarian working at Okanagan College, which is the largest community
[3915.98 → 3918.02] college in the BC interior.
[3918.02 → 3919.52] And he's been leading a Bible study.
[3919.52 → 3925.66] I think it's the first time that Okanagan College has had a Christian club and presence.
[3925.66 → 3926.98] So it's amazing.
[3926.98 → 3930.14] It's amazing what God is doing and how he's blessing our work.
[3930.14 → 3935.20] Most of my work is with students and also with faculty.
[3935.20 → 3939.28] And I've put an update together, and I've mailed it to Dorothy.
[3939.28 → 3942.52] It probably should be in your church mailboxes by next week.
[3942.52 → 3945.18] So you get a little bit of a note of what I'm up to.
[3945.18 → 3951.42] And one thing just I'd ask for some prayer for, as you know, university campuses right
[3951.42 → 3957.66] now are tense places, both for ideological reasons, but also for political reasons.
[3957.66 → 3963.74] And we have a pro-Palestinian encampment popped up about 10 days ago, and it raises the tension
[3963.74 → 3965.82] on campus for sure.
[3965.82 → 3970.72] And so far, things have remained fairly calm, but they're flashpoints for controversy and
[3970.72 → 3973.80] they're flashpoints for sharp disagreement.
[3973.80 → 3979.82] So just keep our university campuses in prayer and me also that I may be a kind of mediating
[3979.82 → 3982.22] presence in these really tense times.
[3982.22 → 3984.30] So thank you again, Ladder CRC.
[3984.30 → 3986.80] God bless you.
[3986.80 → 4000.82] Thank you, Pastor Todd, for your presentation, but also for your sermon this morning.
[4000.82 → 4005.82] It's going to suit us really well in our work and our walk.
[4005.82 → 4008.82] And Lord, also thank you, the worship team for singing.
[4008.82 → 4010.84] It's always a big part of this congregation.
[4010.84 → 4015.84] I don't think you guys get the thanks you deserve because it does make, for me, it means
[4015.84 → 4016.84] a lot.
[4016.84 → 4019.32] So, okay, let's go to the Lord in our prayer.
[4019.32 → 4025.34] Father God, it is before your throne of grace that we come and through the death of the cross
[4025.34 → 4031.88] that we can bring you our prayers and our petitions at your feet.
[4031.88 → 4037.34] Conflicts in the world, Lord, Ukraine, the Middle East, conflicts in Africa.
[4037.34 → 4044.96] Lord, we ask that you change the egos and the presentations that these leaders have.
[4044.96 → 4049.14] Bring your gospel to these leaders and to the people.
[4049.14 → 4051.68] Be with the children of these conflicts, Lord.
[4051.68 → 4057.36] We have no idea just how this is going to affect them and for the generations that follow.
[4057.36 → 4063.90] Lord, we know that children that have been affected by war carry this through the rest
[4063.90 → 4065.04] of their lives.
[4065.04 → 4067.68] Watch over and keep the children.
[4067.68 → 4072.92] Our governments, Lord, with its federal, provincial, local government, Lord, may they all make
[4072.92 → 4079.44] God-fearing decisions about how in our lives our governments should be run.
[4079.44 → 4081.74] Watch over and keep them.
[4081.74 → 4088.10] Be with this church council as we seek to lead this church family with wisdom and understanding.
[4088.10 → 4093.32] Be with Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy as they seek to lead in a Christ-entered way.
[4093.32 → 4095.96] Watch over and bless them in all the things that they do.
[4095.96 → 4102.28] Bless the many volunteers that make ministries happen in this church.
[4102.28 → 4107.64] Long-running friendship service, a ministry that has long been reaching into the community
[4107.64 → 4108.76] for many years.
[4108.76 → 4110.96] Watch over the many volunteers that work there.
[4110.96 → 4116.10] Be with the Sunday School Ministries both in the Chinese and the English language and lead
[4116.10 → 4118.92] children to Christ.
[4118.92 → 4122.38] We ask that you bless our local church family.
[4122.38 → 4128.74] Lord be with Gina and Dave Fraser as they seek to honour the life of Jeanette on Saturday.
[4128.74 → 4130.60] Watch over and keep them.
[4130.60 → 4132.38] Bless them.
[4132.38 → 4138.34] Many of us have been experiencing the passing of the torch to the next generation.
[4138.34 → 4140.34] And Lord bless the passing of this torch.
[4140.34 → 4143.10] And it's a generation to generation.
[4143.10 → 4145.60] May the Lord be honoured.
[4145.60 → 4149.26] Lord be with the hurting and the suffering in the church family.
[4149.26 → 4150.58] The hurting may be known.
[4150.58 → 4152.02] It may not be known.
[4152.02 → 4154.06] Lord, but you know them all.
[4154.06 → 4160.38] Lord ask help us to reach out a hand of compassion and walk alongside where we are able.
[4160.38 → 4167.14] Lord, we thank you for the memory that we had yesterday with the life of Amy Iron.
[4167.14 → 4172.14] Be with WIM and his three girls and all of Amy's siblings and friends and relatives as
[4172.14 → 4175.48] we process this loss.
[4175.48 → 4181.18] Bless George Colin's treatment and may they continue to have the results to full healing.
[4181.18 → 4186.74] Bless George and Carrie and give them patience in what they do.
[4186.74 → 4189.30] Be with the ministry of the Noggin UBC.
[4189.30 → 4191.98] Watch over Todd and his ministry there.
[4191.98 → 4193.86] Bless him in what he does.
[4193.86 → 4197.06] And bless the words that he speaks and the actions that he has.
[4197.06 → 4202.06] And Lord, we thank you for the blessing that he's been to us this morning.
[4202.06 → 4204.94] And Lord, we ask that you watch over and keep us.
[4204.94 → 4212.82] And go with us this week as we take this morning's message and spread the news of your salvation.
[4212.82 → 4217.50] And all God's people said, Amen.
[4217.50 → 4232.18] Let's rise for God's blessing.
[4232.18 → 4238.86] Our benediction comes from the book of Hebrews.
[4238.86 → 4239.86] Jesus.
[4239.86 → 4247.86] May the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that great shepherd
[4247.86 → 4253.42] of the sheep, equip us with everything we need to do his will.
[4253.42 → 4257.10] Through Jesus Christ we pray, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4257.10 → 4258.10] Amen.
[4258.10 → 4265.10] We receive your blessing.
[4265.10 → 4286.68] We receive your blessing, we receive your grace
[4286.68 → 4292.78] As we walk in the light shining from your grace
