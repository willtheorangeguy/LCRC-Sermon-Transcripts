[27.34 → 28.34] Amen.
[57.34 → 58.34] Amen.
[87.34 → 88.34] Amen.
[117.34 → 118.34] Amen.
[147.34 → 149.34] Amen.
[177.34 → 178.34] Amen.
[207.34 → 208.34] Amen.
[237.34 → 261.88] Good morning.
[262.30 → 262.94] Good morning.
[263.24 → 265.42] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[265.42 → 266.24] My name is Jason.
[266.24 → 267.38] I'm one of the pastors here.
[268.04 → 273.50] And we are really blessed that in God's providence that you are here this morning.
[274.16 → 280.82] And it is a joy to worship the Lord together with you, to be gathered as the Lord's people.
[281.84 → 283.54] And it's a joy to do that.
[283.84 → 287.58] And if you're visiting with us today, we are especially glad that you're here.
[288.12 → 292.46] Today is Family Worship Sunday, when we'll be worshipping as a whole church.
[292.46 → 296.76] And also we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper later on in the service.
[297.84 → 300.84] So just a couple of announcements as we begin.
[301.64 → 308.06] First is, today is the day when we will be collecting the Faith Promise Giving forms.
[308.06 → 310.48] So that will be after the service.
[310.48 → 315.60] Our deacons will be standing at the doors, and you're not allowed out unless you put one in.
[315.70 → 316.08] Just kidding.
[316.48 → 319.58] No, just that's where they will be collecting them as you go out.
[320.08 → 321.86] If you...
[321.86 → 322.88] Okay.
[322.88 → 324.56] So that will be good.
[325.48 → 334.68] The next thing, announcement, is that we have these invitations to our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day worship service.
[334.68 → 346.28] So December 24th, 630, we will be having a Christmas Eve service with Marian's famous drama and scripture reading.
[346.82 → 351.80] And then the next morning, we will have a Christmas Day service, which will be more casual.
[351.80 → 359.54] And so you can pick up one of these invitations and share them with your neighbours and your friends and invite them to come and join us.
[361.08 → 368.20] And then lastly, I want to invite Marian to come up and share a bit from her recent trip with Don in Greece.
[369.72 → 370.44] Sorry, Don.
[374.52 → 380.24] Good morning.
[380.24 → 382.24] Good morning.
[382.24 → 383.24] Good morning.
[383.24 → 384.24] Good morning.
[384.24 → 385.24] Actually, I just asked if I could bring greetings from Hannah this morning.
[385.24 → 387.48] You'll hear a little bit more from us next week about our experiences there.
[387.48 → 395.46] So, we've been texting a little bit back and forth since we're back and our minds are still very much in Greece.
[395.46 → 397.52] But I would thank you very much for your prayers.
[397.52 → 401.76] They are much appreciated and needed while we were there.
[401.76 → 415.00] So, Hannah said, oh, before I say that, this feels a little bit apostolic when I say, people of Ladder CRC, I bring you greetings from Modelling, Greece.
[415.00 → 417.00] Doesn't that sound great?
[417.00 → 418.00] I love that.
[418.00 → 426.00] So, I bring you greetings from Hannah in Greece, and she says, please thank the Ladder CRC for the card and all their encouragement.
[426.00 → 431.00] It is amazing to have all of this support after many years of managing on my own.
[431.00 → 435.00] It's like working far away but still being at home at the same time.
[435.00 → 437.00] Give them my love.
[437.00 → 444.00] So, with that, you'll hear more from us next week.
[444.00 → 449.00] Okay.
[449.00 → 456.00] So, today is the second Sunday in the church season of Advent.
[456.00 → 465.00] And that is the season when we, of course, celebrate the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who is Emmanuel, God with us.
[465.00 → 470.00] At the same time though, we also look forward, and we wait for his return.
[470.00 → 477.00] So, imagine perhaps for a moment your best Christmas ever.
[477.00 → 489.00] When Jesus returns, it will just be, you know, our best Christmas ever will only be a foretaste of what it will be like when Jesus returns.
[489.00 → 500.00] But also, if you imagine your worst Christmas ever, well, the good news is that when Jesus comes again, he will heal and mend all that is broken.
[500.00 → 503.00] And he will reign as the true king.
[503.00 → 508.00] And so, our practice is to light candles of our Advent candle.
[508.00 → 510.00] We'll have a reading which will also be on the screen.
[510.00 → 539.00] So, may I invite Harry and Joan to come up and lead us.
[539.00 → 540.00] Return, O Lord.
[540.00 → 541.00] How long?
[541.00 → 544.00] Have pity on your servants.
[544.00 → 549.00] From Psalm 90, verse 13.
[549.00 → 551.00] Prepare the way of the Lord.
[551.00 → 557.00] We light this candle in lament, grieving for our broken world.
[557.00 → 561.00] That Jesus, our Saviour, will come to heal.
[561.00 → 564.00] He will wipe away every tear.
[564.00 → 565.00] Amen.
[565.00 → 568.00] Come, Lord Jesus.
[568.00 → 571.00] Psychic pulling us right for you to obtain for everything.
[571.00 → 572.00] Some of God.
[572.00 → 573.00] Stand before Him.
[573.00 → 574.00] OSI to come, look.
[574.00 → 575.00] Holy Spirit, at all the time with two tongues gratings in the way.
[575.00 → 576.00] One of them is not connected for us.
[576.00 → 577.00] Can we expect you to try to achieve something?
[577.00 → 578.00] UN phenomenal.
[578.00 → 579.00] Animal is being welcomed.

[587.00 → 591.38] Techno Valley, our ERO 걸로, ferociously plays senators,
[591.38 → 601.32] Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration?
[601.70 → 602.82] Let's worship our Lord in prayer.
[603.78 → 606.26] Our gracious God, our Father,
[607.12 → 608.64] you did not remain silent
[608.64 → 612.86] when the world cried out for you to come,
[613.38 → 614.42] but you have spoken,
[615.42 → 617.36] you have answered the cries of your people,
[617.36 → 618.78] you have promised to come,
[618.78 → 622.12] and you did, and you promised to come again
[622.12 → 625.20] when you will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[625.80 → 628.10] And this morning we simply ask you, Father,
[628.18 → 630.74] in the name of Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit
[630.74 → 633.44] that you would enable us this morning
[633.44 → 637.84] to worship you and to rest in you.
[638.80 → 641.56] Would you open our eyes to see your glory?
[642.70 → 645.88] Would you stop our ears to hear your truth?
[645.88 → 649.64] Would you change our hearts that we would become more like you?
[650.30 → 653.62] And we ask it in the precious name of Jesus, our Saviour.
[654.28 → 656.52] And all of God's people said, Amen.
[657.28 → 660.72] Please stand and let's hear God's greeting to us this morning
[660.72 → 665.82] with this call and response from Luke 2, verse 13 and 14.
[665.82 → 671.34] At the birth of Jesus, a heavenly host declared in one voice,
[672.32 → 674.50] Glory to God in the highest,
[674.96 → 679.42] and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests.
[680.20 → 681.90] The peace of the Lord be with you.
[682.42 → 683.86] And also with you.
[684.00 → 686.80] Let's turn and greet one another in that peace.
[686.80 → 704.66] Let's turn and greet one another in that peace.
[707.24 → 709.24] The peace of the Lord was thee that we are in lamination.
[709.92 → 712.36] The peace of the Lord Ben's Brittany and his men
[712.36 → 714.40] choral us in lamination.
[714.52 → 714.78] And the patience the Lord was in there and Irization
[714.78 → 744.76] Planning in public health.
[744.78 → 745.78] Amen.
[774.78 → 775.78] Amen.
[804.78 → 805.78] Amen.
[834.78 → 835.78] Amen.
[864.78 → 876.78] Pray and praise me with the sea, sing the Lord with the perfect song.

[935.16 → 951.72] Come, thou long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[951.72 → 965.72] From our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
[966.72 → 979.72] Israel's strength and consolation, spoke of all the earth, thou art.

[1003.72 → 1010.20] In the years that's yet to be
[1010.20 → 1017.24] Turn the rain to the heavens
[1017.24 → 1024.04] Take the nations in the rain
[1024.04 → 1029.74] Teach your truth in your house
[1029.74 → 1038.04] And you will sing the wonder of all
[1038.04 → 1045.48] Like what you also sing to heaven
[1045.48 → 1053.30] With the truth of your glory at all
[1053.30 → 1056.08] Amen, you may be seated
[1059.74 → 1068.28] So we come now to a time when we
[1068.28 → 1070.92] Confess our sins before the Lord
[1070.92 → 1076.30] And in doing that we seek to be restored
[1076.30 → 1077.80] You know, Jesus came in Advent
[1077.80 → 1079.08] He came to save us
[1079.08 → 1081.62] He came to restore us
[1081.62 → 1084.10] A relationship with Him again
[1084.10 → 1086.96] And He did so even while we were sinners
[1086.96 → 1089.74] And though He has saved us in this life
[1089.74 → 1091.40] This weary world that we live in
[1091.40 → 1093.78] We still struggle with sin
[1093.78 → 1097.26] And we seek more and more to follow Jesus
[1097.26 → 1098.80] In obedience and in faith
[1098.80 → 1101.14] And so this is a way that we practice that
[1101.14 → 1104.24] And become more and more people
[1104.24 → 1105.92] Who are quick to repent
[1105.92 → 1108.78] And then quick to look to our Saviour, Jesus Christ
[1108.78 → 1113.80] And, so I apologize that there's no Chinese translation on this part
[1113.80 → 1116.74] But let's, this will be a confession of sin
[1116.74 → 1117.76] There is responsive
[1117.76 → 1120.06] Okay, so let's say this together
[1120.06 → 1120.78] I will begin
[1120.78 → 1123.12] God of love
[1123.12 → 1125.14] You have made a way
[1125.14 → 1127.18] Where a way seemed impossible
[1127.18 → 1130.60] Because with you nothing is impossible
[1130.60 → 1132.80] And yet we confess
[1132.80 → 1136.62] We are quick to despair and be fearful
[1136.62 → 1140.42] We are quick to accuse and to blame
[1140.42 → 1143.48] And we are slow to trust you
[1143.48 → 1150.64] We confess that we do not live with anticipation of your fulfilled promises
[1150.64 → 1156.72] But live hurried, distracted lives centred on ourselves
[1156.72 → 1159.58] When, Lord, will we remember
[1159.58 → 1163.52] That no one desires our good and our joy more than you
[1163.52 → 1167.66] Forgive us and grant us faith and wisdom
[1167.66 → 1169.96] As you did with Mary
[1169.96 → 1171.90] Enlarge our hearts
[1171.90 → 1174.92] That we may trust in your ways
[1174.92 → 1179.64] So you are invited now to acknowledge these things silently before the Lord
[1179.64 → 1181.16] Who hears you
[1181.16 → 1183.36] Trusting in the promise
[1183.36 → 1186.08] That He forgives you through Jesus Christ
[1186.08 → 1212.84] And Lord, we ask that by your Spirit
[1212.84 → 1214.72] That you would help us, Lord
[1214.72 → 1215.64] To trust in you
[1215.64 → 1217.48] To turn from our self
[1217.48 → 1218.92] Our selfish ways
[1218.92 → 1221.54] And to turn our hearts toward you
[1221.54 → 1224.20] Glorifying your name
[1224.20 → 1225.34] As King of Kings
[1225.34 → 1226.40] And Lord of Lords
[1226.40 → 1228.38] And living, Lord, for your kingdom
[1228.38 → 1229.16] In this world
[1229.16 → 1230.28] We pray in Jesus' name
[1230.28 → 1230.82] Amen
[1230.82 → 1233.36] Let's all stand as we hear
[1233.36 → 1235.84] God's assurance of His pardon
[1235.84 → 1238.62] Because He not only hears our prayers
[1238.62 → 1239.96] But He responds to us
[1239.96 → 1241.70] With words of grace and with peace
[1241.70 → 1246.58] The day will come, says the Lord
[1246.58 → 1250.46] When I will do for my people all the good things I have promised them
[1250.46 → 1253.28] In those days and at that time
[1253.28 → 1257.20] I will raise up a righteous descendant from King David's line
[1257.20 → 1260.80] He will do what is just and right throughout the land
[1260.80 → 1262.86] And on that day
[1262.86 → 1264.84] My people will be saved
[1264.84 → 1267.00] And will live in peace
[1267.00 → 1269.36] God's grace abounds for us
[1269.36 → 1270.76] Even in our weakness
[1270.76 → 1273.10] Let us remember the hope of the gospel
[1273.10 → 1275.96] In Christ we are forgiven
[1275.96 → 1277.40] And let's sing together
[1277.40 → 1301.32] Jesus said that if I thirst
[1301.32 → 1305.02] I should come to Him
[1305.02 → 1310.60] No one else can satisfy
[1310.60 → 1310.90] No one else can satisfy
[1310.90 → 1314.90] No one else can satisfy
[1314.90 → 1320.00] Jesus said that if I thirst
[1320.00 → 1320.90] I will come to Him
[1320.90 → 1323.90] To Him here
[1323.90 → 1326.00] If I thirst
[1326.00 → 1327.90] No one else can satisfy
[1327.90 → 1330.72] You will sing
[1330.72 → 1330.86] My power
[1330.86 → 1331.84] I will rise
[1331.84 → 1334.84] Thank you
[1334.84 → 1336.10] God's mercy
[1336.10 → 1339.24] Jesus said that if He will lift it
[1339.24 → 1340.00] He will shine
[1340.00 → 1341.98] I will come up
[1341.98 → 1343.06] Go down
[1343.06 → 1346.48] Jesus said that if He will come
[1346.48 → 1349.88] In Christ
[1349.88 → 1350.14] Jesus said that if He will
[1350.14 → 1352.42] hers
[1352.42 → 1354.64] Then he will come to Him
[1354.64 → 1355.72] He will come up
[1355.72 → 1369.44] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[1369.44 → 1378.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[1378.80 → 1384.16] Jesus said that if His Contained will, I would be true.
[1384.16 → 1387.76] What is His homeland
[1387.76 → 1395.78] I am indeed he400 of Luisa said heathy.
[1395.78 → 1403.08] Jesus said that if My Holy Spirit blesses His Son
[1403.08 → 1415.08] Jesus said that I am a good one, He will seek me.
[1415.08 → 1424.08] He is a true country, He will seek me.
[1424.08 → 1433.08] We are the one who will seek me.
[1433.08 → 1443.08] We are the one who will seek me.
[1443.08 → 1451.08] We are the one who will seek me.
[1451.08 → 1456.08] We are the one who will seek me.
[1456.08 → 1461.08] We will seek me.
[1461.08 → 1468.08] We will seek me.
[1476.08 → 1478.08] You may be seated.
[1481.08 → 1494.08] So as we come to the Lord's table this morning, let us with one voice confess what it is that we believe.
[1494.08 → 1502.08] And our confession of faith this morning comes from, it's called, Our World Belongs to God, a contemporary testimony.
[1502.08 → 1515.08] So not only do we have the creeds of the church, the Athanasian Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Apostles Creed, and we have the Reformed confessions of the Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism and Canons of Dort.
[1515.08 → 1524.08] But a new expression for our day is in the words of this statement called, Our World Belongs to God.
[1524.08 → 1526.08] And we'll just read a couple of the statements there.
[1526.08 → 1528.08] Let's say this together.
[1528.08 → 1558.08] 
[1558.08 → 1573.08] And that is what we celebrate as we come to the Lord's Supper this morning.
[1573.08 → 1586.08] And that is what we celebrate as we come to the Lord's Supper this morning.
[1586.08 → 1590.08] That Jesus, our Saviour, is strong and kind.
[1590.08 → 1594.08] He is the one who won the victory for our salvation.
[1594.08 → 1598.08] He conquered sin and death and rose from the grave.
[1598.08 → 1606.08] And we, as his people, we simply come with nothing else in our hands but our need for him.
[1606.08 → 1613.08] And we look to him to fill us, to give us life, to give us his blessing.
[1613.08 → 1621.08] If this is not yet your faith, then, you know, we are so glad that you are here.
[1621.08 → 1624.08] But this meal is for you.
[1624.08 → 1633.08] And so, I encourage you to take this opportunity to consider the invitation of our Lord Jesus to put your faith in him.
[1633.08 → 1641.08] For those of you who do trust in him, who come to him empty-handed for what he has accomplished for you on the cross,
[1641.08 → 1643.08] then Jesus bids you come.
[1643.08 → 1649.08] And he invites you, he welcomes you to feast on him.
[1649.08 → 1652.08] And so, hear these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper.
[1652.08 → 1657.08] Brothers and sisters, the Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1657.08 → 1660.08] And when he had given thanks to God, he broke it.
[1660.08 → 1663.08] And he said, this is my body, which is for you.
[1663.08 → 1666.08] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1666.08 → 1675.08] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, this cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[1675.08 → 1681.08] For as often as you, you come to my blood.
[1681.08 → 1684.08] Oh yeah, do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[1684.08 → 1692.08] For as often as you eat this bread, and you drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.

[1711.08 → 1715.08] What you have done by sending your son, Jesus Christ, to be our saviour.
[1715.08 → 1722.08] Lord, we pray that even as we gather to take this meal, that you would dwell with us.
[1722.08 → 1728.08] Would you pour out your Holy Spirit upon us and upon these gifts of bread and cup,
[1728.08 → 1736.08] so that the bread we break and the cup that we bless may be the communion of the body and blood of Christ.
[1736.08 → 1743.08] And Lord, seal in our hearts what is ours through the gospel in Christ Jesus.
[1743.08 → 1755.08] For by him and with him and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honour and glory is yours, almighty God, now and forever. Amen.

[2296.08 → 2297.08] Good.
[2297.08 → 2302.08] So, you know, on Christmas, what's the name of that baby who was born?
[2302.08 → 2303.08] Jesus.
[2303.08 → 2304.08] Jesus, right?
[2304.08 → 2305.08] Yes.
[2305.08 → 2306.08] You all know, right?
[2306.08 → 2307.08] Jesus was born.
[2307.08 → 2308.08] Yeah.
[2308.08 → 2309.08] In a stable.
[2309.08 → 2310.08] Yeah.
[2310.08 → 2311.08] Because all the ends were full.
[2311.08 → 2312.08] Right.
[2312.08 → 2313.08] You got it.
[2313.08 → 2314.08] But you know what?
[2314.08 → 2316.08] There was another baby who was born right around the same time.
[2316.08 → 2318.08] This one you might not know as well.
[2318.08 → 2322.08] His name was John the Baptist.
[2322.08 → 2323.08] John?
[2323.08 → 2324.08] Yes.
[2324.08 → 2325.08] Yeah.
[2325.08 → 2326.08] Okay.
[2326.08 → 2330.08] Well, I want to just read a little bit of this story to you about John.
[2330.08 → 2331.08] Here's what he looks like.
[2331.08 → 2333.08] He's kind of crazy, right?
[2333.08 → 2334.08] Look at that guy.
[2334.08 → 2335.08] Yeah.
[2335.08 → 2336.08] Yeah.
[2336.08 → 2337.08] See?
[2337.08 → 2338.08] John the Baptist.
[2338.08 → 2341.08] Oh, I know that story.
[2341.08 → 2342.08] Yeah.
[2342.08 → 2344.08] You guys see John the Baptist?
[2344.08 → 2345.08] Ew.
[2345.08 → 2346.08] Ew.
[2346.08 → 2348.08] That's what people probably said when they looked at him.
[2348.08 → 2349.08] Ew.
[2349.08 → 2350.08] Yeah.
[2350.08 → 2351.08] There he is.
[2351.08 → 2353.08] So, let me read a little bit.
[2353.08 → 2358.08] About the same time Jesus was born, another baby was born.
[2358.08 → 2361.08] His name was John.
[2361.08 → 2364.08] And God gave a full job to him.
[2364.08 → 2367.08] John was everyone ready for Jesus.
[2367.08 → 2368.08] Jesus.
[2368.08 → 2374.08] The day John was born, his dad knew God's promise to Abraham was coming true.
[2374.08 → 2376.08] God was sending the rescuer.
[2376.08 → 2378.08] Who's the rescuer?
[2378.08 → 2379.08] I don't know.
[2379.08 → 2380.08] You don't know.
[2380.08 → 2382.08] Who said this earlier?
[2382.08 → 2383.08] You said it earlier.
[2383.08 → 2384.08] Jesus, right?
[2384.08 → 2385.08] So, Jesus is the rescuer.
[2385.08 → 2386.08] Right?
[2386.08 → 2387.08] Okay.
[2387.08 → 2388.08] John.
[2388.08 → 2389.08] John.
[2389.08 → 2391.08] Oh, so John's dad.
[2391.08 → 2393.08] Who do you know who John's dad is?
[2393.08 → 2394.08] What do you guys think?
[2394.08 → 2395.08] His name is Zechariah.
[2395.08 → 2397.08] Can you guys say Zechariah?
[2397.08 → 2398.08] Zechariah.
[2398.08 → 2399.08] Zechariah.
[2399.08 → 2403.08] So, he sang a song when his baby was born.
[2403.08 → 2404.08] Here's the song.
[2404.08 → 2409.08] Because God loves us with a never stopping, never giving up, unbleaching, always and forever
[2409.08 → 2410.08] love.
[2410.08 → 2412.08] Heaven is breaking through.
[2412.08 → 2413.08] Is he going to eat this?
[2413.08 → 2414.08] I'll tell you in a minute.
[2414.08 → 2415.08] Yeah.
[2415.08 → 2419.08] He is sending us a light from heaven to shine on us like the sun.
[2419.08 → 2424.08] To shine on those who live in darkness, in the shadow of death, to guide our feet in
[2424.08 → 2425.08] the way of peace.
[2425.08 → 2432.08] So, John grew up, and well, to tell you the truth, he was a bit unusual.
[2432.08 → 2434.08] He lived in the desert.
[2434.08 → 2439.08] He had a more itchy, scraggly, scraggly, made with of camel hair.
[2439.08 → 2447.08] He had a big, bushy beard, like this, and a long, scraggly hair.
[2447.08 → 2449.08] And here's the oddest thing of all.
[2449.08 → 2450.08] He ate locusts.
[2450.08 → 2451.08] You know what locusts are?
[2451.08 → 2453.08] It's these.
[2453.08 → 2454.08] And honey.
[2454.08 → 2455.08] It's like grasshoppers.
[2455.08 → 2456.08] And honey.
[2456.08 → 2457.08] And honey.
[2457.08 → 2461.08] And he kind of, I bet, he dipped the locusts in the honey.
[2461.08 → 2462.08] And he had a little honey.
[2462.08 → 2463.08] Like that.
[2463.08 → 2464.08] And he ate them.
[2464.08 → 2465.08] And he ate them.
[2465.08 → 2466.08] Yeah.
[2466.08 → 2467.08] French fries and ketchup.
[2467.08 → 2468.08] Like French fries and ketchup.
[2468.08 → 2470.08] Locusts and honey.
[2470.08 → 2473.08] It's the new flavour at McDonald's, I heard.
[2473.08 → 2474.08] Yeah.
[2474.08 → 2480.08] But God sent John, this crazy guy, to tell his people something important.
[2480.08 → 2483.08] John said, stop running away from God.
[2483.08 → 2485.08] Run to God.
[2485.08 → 2488.08] John said, you need to be rescued.
[2488.08 → 2489.08] I have good news.
[2489.08 → 2490.08] The rescuer is coming.
[2490.08 → 2492.08] Make your hearts ready for him.
[2492.08 → 2493.08] Yes.
[2493.08 → 2497.08] Get ready because your king is coming back for you.
[2497.08 → 2498.08] Okay.
[2498.08 → 2504.08] So when we think about Christmas, I want you to think about making your hearts ready because
[2504.08 → 2507.08] Jesus is coming to rescue you.
[2507.08 → 2508.08] Okay.
[2508.08 → 2509.08] Can you remember that?
[2509.08 → 2511.08] Jesus is our rescuer.
[2511.08 → 2516.08] And this season is about getting ready for Jesus to come.
[2516.08 → 2517.08] Okay.
[2517.08 → 2518.08] Sound good?
[2518.08 → 2519.08] All right.
[2519.08 → 2520.08] God, we pray for us.
[2520.08 → 2526.08] Lord, would you help each one of us prepare our hearts.
[2526.08 → 2529.08] A rescuer.
[2529.08 → 2532.08] And we thank you that Jesus is our rescuer.
[2532.08 → 2533.08] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2533.08 → 2534.08] Amen.
[2534.08 → 2535.08] All right.
[2535.08 → 2536.08] Go ahead.
[2536.08 → 2547.48] our Chinese brothers and sisters are dismissed for their service for children there is no older
[2547.48 → 2550.18] class today be the first class
[2566.08 → 2596.02] good morning again thank you we are as you know as I we began earlier in saying
[2596.02 → 2602.64] we are in the church season of Advent and to remind you it's the season when we join with
[2602.64 → 2612.02] God's church around the world in celebrating what the old Christmas carol hymn calls the thrill of
[2612.02 → 2618.54] hope do you all know that one right that's that's what is at the heart of the gospel this thrill
[2618.54 → 2626.82] of hope the weary world rejoices and yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
[2626.82 → 2639.50] fall no we won't get carried away but when Jesus was born everything changed right when Jesus was
[2639.50 → 2648.88] born everything became new God answered the cries of the world the cries that were going on for
[2648.88 → 2655.58] centuries and centuries for God to come and save us right from this awful mess that we've made
[2655.58 → 2663.94] of our world and of our own lives and in his coming he began to bring his restoration he began
[2663.94 → 2671.90] to bring his renewal, but then he also promised to come again and on that great day when Jesus returns
[2671.90 → 2679.82] he will return with the fullness of the kingdom in tow and all things will be made new fully and finally
[2679.82 → 2687.76] that is what the season of Advent is about and in this season as a church we are seeking to prepare
[2687.76 → 2697.18] the way for Jesus to come into each of our lives you know that's what Christmas is about is we want Jesus
[2697.18 → 2706.00] to come to us right we want our hearts to be ready to receive and greet this coming Saviour and the way to
[2706.00 → 2714.84] help us do that this year is by considering this mysterious weird scraggly beard guy John the Baptist
[2714.84 → 2723.76] who the Bible calls a herald and a prophet of the one whom the world is waiting for
[2723.76 → 2731.60] so last week if we remember we began John's story with the birth announcement where the angel Gabriel
[2731.60 → 2739.74] came to Zachariah and Elizabeth and gave them the news that Elizabeth who was barren would bear a child
[2739.74 → 2746.86] and he would be the one who would make ready a people prepared for the Lord now this morning we're
[2746.86 → 2752.42] going to continue the story by looking at this well-known passage that's sometimes referred to as the
[2752.42 → 2759.36] visitation the visitation of Mary and Elizabeth so let's open our Bibles to the Gospel of Luke
[2759.36 → 2761.52] chapter 1
[2761.52 → 2771.60] in our passage this morning is verses 39 to 45 that is on page 761 of your pew Bible if you'd like to
[2771.60 → 2775.96] follow along there, or you can follow along on the screen as well both are okay
[2775.96 → 2786.22] so Luke chapter 1 this is on page 761 Luke chapter 1 verses 39 to 45
[2786.22 → 2795.44] let's give our attention to the reading of God's word at that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in
[2795.44 → 2803.10] the hill country of Judea where she entered Zachariah's home and greeted Elizabeth when Elizabeth heard
[2803.10 → 2810.38] Mary's greeting the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit in a loud
[2810.38 → 2818.24] voice she exclaimed blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear but why am I so
[2818.24 → 2824.44] favoured that the mother of my Lord should come to me as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my
[2824.44 → 2834.00] ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to
[2834.00 → 2837.66] her will be accomplished this is the word of the Lord
[2837.66 → 2846.14] so let's pray for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word
[2846.14 → 2856.94] show us your ways oh Lord teach us your paths guide us in your truth and teach us for you are God our
[2856.94 → 2860.60] Saviour and our hope is in you amen
[2860.60 → 2866.18] have you ever learned to say hello
[2866.18 → 2874.56] I mean not in your native language but maybe in another language right learning to say hello
[2874.56 → 2882.16] is so basic so fundamental that when you learn a new language it's like the first thing you learn
[2882.16 → 2891.42] bonjour I'm going to butcher these uh NI hao I can do that one um some cultures they have pretty
[2891.42 → 2896.88] interesting ways of greeting I heard that in Tibet do you know what they do to greet in Tibet
[2896.88 → 2905.70] stick out their tongue yeah so that's cool I'm sure there's you know cultural significance behind it
[2905.70 → 2911.78] which I don't know you know and of course many countries many languages have variations of the kind
[2911.78 → 2921.38] peace be upon you greeting, so there's Korean on your house sale or the Arabic a salaam alaikum
[2921.38 → 2933.08] what do we have in English hello it's kind of boring in my opinion like what does that even mean hello
[2933.08 → 2941.12] but you know we do have another greeting in American English that's much better do you know what it is
[2941.12 → 2948.52] what's up do you know what's up how do you all say what's up here in Canada I am a Canadian
[2948.52 → 2954.14] now, but I don't know if you say what's up much I don't think this is what you teach the English as a
[2954.14 → 2964.66] second language class Pat do we teach what's up no probably not so this greeting of course was
[2964.66 → 2969.94] memorialized in those Budweiser commercials from a while back you know the original commercial the
[2969.94 → 2976.36] these guys, and they're on the phone like the old phones with the cords greeting each other and it
[2976.36 → 2981.84] begins with like what's up, and then you know more guys kind of join the conversation they get on the
[2981.84 → 2988.70] phones and it kind of increases to like what's up and then like what's up and then finally it's just
[2988.70 → 2995.02] like ah you know it kind of becomes that so that that's that's how you say hello in English
[2995.02 → 3005.78] so that's the American greeting now what are we doing in Advent what is Advent well I think one way
[3005.78 → 3011.96] to think about it and what I'd like to suggest is that Advent is God's divine greeting to you
[3011.96 → 3025.00] so if I could be permitted to say it is God's what's up in Advent God comes to you, and he's seeking
[3025.00 → 3033.04] to capture your attention he's seeking to turn your face towards him in your heart towards him
[3033.04 → 3041.84] that you might be prepared to greet the Saviour and this is one of the themes that we find in the
[3041.84 → 3049.06] opening chapter of Luke's gospel that's actually not really a theme in the other gospels and so why
[3049.06 → 3059.96] is Luke so preoccupied kind of obsessed with this idea of greeting well I mean greetings are very
[3059.96 → 3067.58] important right they're the way that we establish relationship I greet you right and hopefully you
[3067.58 → 3072.46] respond okay now we're now we're communicating we have a relationship and in fact when you came into
[3072.46 → 3079.56] the church this morning we had a team of folks greeting you right making a connection offering a smile
[3079.56 → 3088.64] a handshake welcoming you into our midst, but it's more than just welcoming you to join a people
[3088.64 → 3096.90] it's an extension of God's hospitality and that's why we begin our worship service each Sunday with
[3096.90 → 3104.18] God's greeting right the words of greeting remind us that God welcomes us into his presence
[3104.18 → 3110.86] okay that we don't come and welcome God but God calls us, and then he welcomes us he takes the
[3110.86 → 3118.78] initiative and so what Advent is the coming of Jesus into the world in an act of divine greeting
[3118.78 → 3125.82] an act of divine welcome and hospitality right in Advent God greets us he comes to establish
[3125.82 → 3136.04] a relationship with us in that we would be prepared to return that greeting to welcome him and so in
[3136.04 → 3142.90] these Advent stories in the Gospel of Luke in chapter one God is literally saying hello to us
[3142.90 → 3152.64] and in the hello of God the greeting of God is a compassionate hello right because notice who God
[3152.64 → 3159.30] greets in this first chapter of Luke God goes, and he greets, and he pronounces his favour upon two
[3159.30 → 3168.24] disempowered women so we last week we met Elizabeth and you may remember she had the blessing of being
[3168.24 → 3176.04] of a priestly lineage, but she also had the great burden in her life that she was barren she wasn't able
[3176.04 → 3183.28] to have a child which was not only a deep source of disappointment for her but also a source of
[3183.28 → 3191.02] social disgrace but even more so it was actually kind of an existential crisis because she would not
[3191.02 → 3197.82] have anyone to care for her in her old age and then even more so spiritually it was like kind of
[3197.82 → 3205.74] your story of what God is doing generation to generation ends you are somewhat excluded from the
[3205.74 → 3214.88] ongoing story of God's people and so for God to come to barren Elizabeth with a greeting is a picture of God's
[3214.88 → 3224.42] compassionate welcome when he comes into the world now the other woman that we meet in these first this
[3224.42 → 3233.40] first chapter of Luke is Mary so the same Gabriel who appeared to Zachariah in the temple he goes to see Mary
[3233.40 → 3237.12] and so let's look at chapter 1 verse 28
[3237.12 → 3248.60] the angel went to her and said note the word greetings you who are highly favoured the Lord is with you
[3248.60 → 3255.36] Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be
[3255.36 → 3264.26] so notice what it says Mary was not greatly troubled at the fact that God's angelic messenger
[3264.26 → 3273.50] the know the captain of God's army came to visit her right I mean the sheer glory of Gabriel
[3273.50 → 3280.18] would have bowled over any normal human being as it does Zachariah right when Gabriel appears
[3280.18 → 3287.00] to Zachariah it says he was struck or gripped with fear that's the normal response Mary's like
[3287.00 → 3294.38] what kind of greeting is that that's her response not like who is this amazing guy he's like what are
[3294.38 → 3303.90] you saying to me see what was troubling her was that in the deepest part of who she is amazed
[3303.90 → 3313.28] at God's compassionate greeting to her, she is amazed that God is establishing a relationship
[3313.28 → 3323.52] with her, and she tells us why she is so amazed later in Luke chapter 1 in Mary's song known as the
[3323.52 → 3333.70] Magnificat in verse 46 this is what Mary says and Mary said my soul glorifies the Lord my spirit rejoices in
[3333.70 → 3340.54] God my Saviour for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant from now on all generations will
[3340.54 → 3350.34] call me blessed see Mary is blown away by God's greeting by God's welcome and why why why is this so
[3350.34 → 3360.62] shocking to her well it's because she is nobody special she is someone of humble state right she was poor
[3360.62 → 3371.16] she was young she was unwed at that point, and so she was at the very bottom of the pecking order
[3371.16 → 3380.66] and so Mary is not highly favoured because she's special as she in fact knows and realizes but because
[3380.66 → 3387.04] and we know that also because what she says about herself she says my spirit rejoices in God
[3387.04 → 3396.30] my Saviour Mary knows she needs a Saviour she is a sinner living in a weary world just like the rest of us
[3396.30 → 3404.92] and so she has this deep sense of wonder why would the mighty one do great things for me
[3404.92 → 3411.58] and I kind of as I was thinking about this I feel somewhat convicted by this because
[3411.58 → 3420.34] if something bad happens to me that's when I say why me right don't you do that something bad happens
[3420.34 → 3430.58] why me but when Mary receives a blessing from God that's when she says why me why would God greet me
[3430.58 → 3438.56] in this way, and you know what it's its something we should all feel because we do see something of
[3438.56 → 3447.66] ourselves in Mary in that we are all undeserving we are all of humble state right we're all in need of a
[3447.66 → 3454.76] Saviour and when we look at Mary it may have kind of seemed obvious given her social status at that time
[3454.76 → 3463.16] but if we could see the real spiritual state of our hearts it would look obvious to us too
[3463.16 → 3474.62] that we would say Lord why me and yet God has done great things for me and so each of us should be
[3474.62 → 3482.24] thinking why me but now in the announcement to Mary that you know Gabriel comes to Mary he gives this
[3482.24 → 3489.36] announcement of her pregnancy at the same time Gabriel also told Mary that her relative Elizabeth
[3489.36 → 3499.96] was also pregnant and Gabriel invites her to go visit Mary go kind of confirm what God is up to right
[3499.96 → 3509.18] now and so in verse 39 Mary goes off to see Elizabeth at that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in
[3509.18 → 3516.52] the hill country of Judea where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth now this might seem a natural
[3516.52 → 3527.68] thing to do right but Elizabeth was not just down the road a few blocks Elizabeth was a long and arduous
[3527.68 → 3534.18] and likely very dangerous journey away from all the way up in the north in Galilee all the way along the
[3534.18 → 3543.90] Jordan River to Jerusalem in the hill country of Judea this is a long journey why would she make such a
[3543.90 → 3552.00] journey right aren't there expectant mothers in Galilee right that she could have talked to right but the
[3552.00 → 3558.62] thing is Mary doesn't go to visit Elizabeth in order to compare notes on birthing methods or to kind of
[3558.62 → 3566.12] talk about what is the newest stroller that's kind of all the rage right now no she goes to Elizabeth
[3566.12 → 3574.94] because they are in a unique situation right for both of them their pregnancy is not just like unlikely or
[3574.94 → 3583.22] unexpected but their pregnancy is miraculous right with Elizabeth she was not only very old
[3583.22 → 3592.24] the angel says she was barren and then Mary was a virgin these are two people you don't expect to get
[3592.24 → 3601.62] pregnant both of them had their pregnancies announced by an angel both of them had been told that the
[3601.62 → 3608.84] baby that they are going to expect was to play a significant role in God's purposes so this is why
[3608.84 → 3618.66] Mary has to see Elizabeth and that's why we're told I think in verse 39 that she hurried to visit
[3618.66 → 3628.00] Elizabeth right she had to get there but when they get there we know when Mary arrives at Elizabeth's door
[3628.00 → 3634.02] the prevailing note is not one of consternation like oh my goodness what on earth is happening
[3634.02 → 3643.42] no when they get together the prevailing note of their meeting is one of joy it's one of joy
[3643.42 → 3650.72] and we see that from the very moment Mary arrives we're told that as she entered the house and greeted
[3650.72 → 3658.78] Elizabeth that it was an it was a moment of joy, and we're not given so much Elizabeth's reaction to
[3658.78 → 3668.50] Mary's greeting as we are given Elizabeth's baby's reaction to Mary's greeting so let's look at verse 41
[3668.50 → 3677.92] when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting we'll stop there for a moment okay so now if we didn't already
[3677.92 → 3684.20] just read this passage and if you weren't familiar with the story how would you finish that sentence
[3684.20 → 3691.96] probably you would say something like this when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting
[3691.96 → 3700.18] she was overjoyed to see her relative right that would make sense or when Elizabeth heard Mary's
[3700.18 → 3708.70] greeting she gave her a warm smile and a big hug or when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting she went to
[3708.70 → 3715.12] the kitchen to get a bowl of olives and set it out on the table right I mean something like that would be
[3715.12 → 3721.72] a natural way expected of finishing that sentence, but I doubt any of us would naturally
[3721.72 → 3730.60] have finished the sentence like we read it in verse 41 when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting the baby leaped
[3730.60 → 3736.84] in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit I mean that's kind of unexpected
[3736.84 → 3746.72] the baby of course is John the Baptist right the prophet who would prepare the way for the Messiah
[3746.72 → 3753.28] and when we think about John the Baptist we often think of him like that children's book we think of
[3753.28 → 3760.54] him as a grown man with a big scraggly beard living in the desert wearing clothes made out of camel's hair
[3760.54 → 3766.82] eating locusts dipped in honey and telling people stuff like repent the kingdom of heaven
[3766.82 → 3776.82] heaven is at hand I mean this is like a tough dude and yet his first prophetic act was not in the desert
[3776.82 → 3786.38] but it was in the womb and the reason John leaps for joy is because of who Jesus is right this is not just
[3786.38 → 3795.62] John like saying what's up I'm a baby you're a baby cool right that's not that's not the greeting
[3795.62 → 3806.58] because John knows who he being in the presence of he knows that this other baby is no less than whom
[3806.58 → 3815.14] he's no less than God Almighty if God came before you and greeted you what's the proper response
[3815.14 → 3818.12] leaping for joy may be a good one
[3818.12 → 3826.56] and that was what the angel has said to Mary when the angel came to Mary he said your baby he will be
[3826.56 → 3830.40] great, and he will be called son of the most high
[3830.40 → 3840.80] and this is what Elizabeth herself also knows right in verse 42 Elizabeth is filled with the Holy Spirit
[3840.80 → 3844.46] and she prophesizes she utters a prophetic utterance
[3844.46 → 3860.38] and in a loud voice she exclaimed blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear but why am I so favoured that the mother of my Lord should come to me
[3860.40 → 3867.40] right Mary is no longer simply Elizabeth's younger relative
[3867.40 → 3872.40] Mary is now to Elizabeth the mother of my Lord
[3872.40 → 3879.40] right she knows that in Mary's womb is no one less than the Lord God
[3879.40 → 3885.96] and then what's even more remarkable is Elizabeth then goes on in verse 45
[3885.96 → 3895.96] to talk about the Lord again she says blessed is the one who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her
[3895.96 → 3905.40] so what does this tell us about who Jesus is it means the Lord is both the one who is giving Mary this promise that she will bear a son
[3905.40 → 3911.90] and also the same Lord that Mary is now carrying in her womb
[3911.90 → 3919.16] in other words Jesus is as God is
[3919.16 → 3923.68] you know of course every child is unique
[3923.68 → 3926.10] right every child is precious
[3926.10 → 3930.52] but this child in Mary is not like any baby
[3930.52 → 3932.92] before or since
[3932.92 → 3938.28] and it is significant that it's John who recognizes this
[3938.28 → 3941.70] because John was going to be the final Old Testament prophet
[3941.70 → 3946.14] right in a whole long line of prophets
[3946.14 → 3948.86] stretching throughout the centuries
[3948.86 → 3954.48] all looking forward to and waiting and anticipating the coming of the Messiah
[3954.48 → 3956.90] all of these centuries waiting
[3956.90 → 3958.68] and Jesus
[3958.68 → 3960.04] comes
[3960.04 → 3962.42] and John leaps for joy
[3962.42 → 3964.30] and it's like
[3964.30 → 3965.52] in that leap
[3965.52 → 3967.44] it's like the whole Old Testament
[3967.44 → 3970.18] is leaping with him
[3970.18 → 3974.94] he's just like embodying all the longing of all of God's people
[3974.94 → 3976.38] throughout all of those centuries
[3976.38 → 3978.20] and greets the Messiah
[3978.20 → 3979.54] and leaps for joy
[3979.54 → 3984.94] and friends this is a joy that we are invited into as well
[3984.94 → 3988.50] right because all of those longings of the Old Testament
[3988.50 → 3990.80] throughout all of those hard centuries
[3990.80 → 3994.20] are the very same longings of our hearts as well
[3994.20 → 3997.84] right longing that into this dark world
[3997.84 → 4000.74] God would finally come and be with us
[4000.74 → 4007.62] longing that God would actually come and mend all that is broken in our lives
[4007.62 → 4009.90] all that's around us
[4009.90 → 4011.30] and then even more poignantly
[4011.30 → 4015.66] that God would come and mend what is broken within each of us
[4015.66 → 4020.06] as the carol puts it
[4020.06 → 4026.20] the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
[4026.20 → 4030.40] and all of that is happening now
[4030.40 → 4033.64] in the child that Mary is carrying
[4033.64 → 4035.82] you know and so Mary
[4035.82 → 4037.42] she had a unique role to play
[4037.42 → 4039.06] in God's redemptive purposes
[4039.06 → 4041.72] right she is the mother of the Lord
[4041.72 → 4044.84] that was her unique privilege
[4044.84 → 4048.80] only she gets to have God in her womb
[4048.80 → 4052.80] but all of us here this morning
[4052.80 → 4056.22] can know the blessing of having Christ in us
[4056.22 → 4059.30] Paul in his letter to the Colossians
[4059.30 → 4063.84] he funnels down all the message of Christianity
[4063.84 → 4067.38] into the short phrase in Colossians 1.27
[4067.38 → 4069.68] he says Christ in you
[4069.68 → 4072.10] the hope of glory
[4072.10 → 4077.42] and because of what this child would do
[4077.42 → 4079.96] what he would grow up to do
[4079.96 → 4081.98] because of that we can have Jesus
[4081.98 → 4086.36] by his spirit dwelling in us as well
[4086.36 → 4089.10] and how do we receive him
[4089.10 → 4092.40] we receive the greeting of God
[4092.40 → 4094.12] who comes to us in Advent
[4094.12 → 4096.76] we receive the welcome of God
[4096.76 → 4100.06] the wanting to establish a relationship with you God
[4100.06 → 4102.22] through faith by believing
[4102.22 → 4105.12] and so if we look at verse 45 again
[4105.12 → 4108.66] blessed is she who has believed
[4108.66 → 4111.04] that the Lord will fulfill his promises to her
[4111.04 → 4112.50] why is Mary blessed?
[4113.76 → 4115.00] because she believed
[4115.00 → 4117.08] she believed what God said
[4117.08 → 4120.40] and we can receive the greeting of God
[4120.40 → 4121.00] like Mary
[4121.00 → 4122.88] by hearing the promise of God
[4122.88 → 4124.96] by believing the promise of God
[4124.96 → 4126.74] and by obeying God
[4126.74 → 4128.92] and rejoicing in his promises
[4128.92 → 4131.00] so as we conclude
[4131.00 → 4133.62] in a moment we are going to sing the song
[4133.62 → 4134.90] O little town of Bethlehem
[4134.90 → 4137.70] and I want to highlight some of the words
[4137.70 → 4138.60] that we are about to sing
[4138.60 → 4142.94] so we can meditate on it as we sing
[4142.94 → 4144.14] this is what it says
[4144.14 → 4147.14] O holy child of Bethlehem
[4147.14 → 4150.20] descend to us
[4150.20 → 4151.56] we pray
[4151.56 → 4153.98] cast out our sin
[4153.98 → 4155.46] and enter in
[4155.46 → 4158.40] be born in us
[4158.40 → 4159.40] today
[4159.40 → 4162.58] we hear the Christmas angels
[4162.58 → 4164.70] the great glad tidings tell
[4164.70 → 4165.94] O come
[4165.94 → 4167.38] to us
[4167.38 → 4168.62] abide
[4168.62 → 4169.66] in
[4169.66 → 4170.58] us
[4170.58 → 4172.22] our Lord
[4172.22 → 4173.58] Emmanuel
[4173.58 → 4174.66] God with us
[4174.66 → 4177.50] let's pray
[4177.50 → 4183.84] oh
[4183.84 → 4185.16] how wonderfully
[4185.16 → 4187.22] you do Lord
[4187.22 → 4190.32] you come
[4190.32 → 4190.86] and you abide
[4190.86 → 4191.54] with us
[4191.54 → 4192.64] and Lord
[4192.64 → 4193.80] in this Advent season
[4193.80 → 4195.36] in the midst of
[4195.36 → 4197.10] the busyness of life
[4197.10 → 4198.10] the distractions
[4198.10 → 4200.62] the voices
[4200.62 → 4201.96] that pull our hearts
[4201.96 → 4202.78] in different directions
[4202.78 → 4204.06] we ask that you would help us
[4204.06 → 4204.78] to uncover
[4204.78 → 4206.14] any unbelief
[4206.14 → 4206.80] in our hearts
[4206.80 → 4208.82] we ask that you
[4208.82 → 4210.48] might make your presence
[4210.48 → 4211.52] among us
[4211.52 → 4212.92] and within us
[4212.92 → 4214.16] would you fill us
[4214.16 → 4215.16] with the same spirit
[4215.16 → 4216.78] that filled our Lord Jesus
[4216.78 → 4217.92] that filled Elizabeth
[4217.92 → 4221.56] grant that we would
[4221.56 → 4223.24] receive your greeting
[4223.24 → 4225.30] with hearts of faith
[4225.30 → 4227.04] so that we would
[4227.04 → 4227.84] receive your blessing
[4227.84 → 4229.06] according to your promises
[4229.06 → 4231.36] we pray in Jesus name
[4231.36 → 4232.16] and for his sake
[4232.16 → 4233.00] amen
[4233.00 → 4235.04] all right
[4235.04 → 4235.66] let's stand
[4235.66 → 4236.32] and let's sing
[4236.32 → 4237.78] O little town of Bethlehem

[4741.40 → 4751.96] Our Father and our God, we come into your presence this morning, not as strangers, but as your children.
[4751.96 → 4761.16] We come not with fear, but with confidence, not with pride, but in humility.
[4761.16 → 4771.44] And we come giving thanks to you, we come to the Lord in the inheritance of the saints in glory.
[4771.44 → 4787.10] You have delivered us from the kingdom of the Lord, in whom we have delivered us, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.
[4787.10 → 4811.56] And so, Father, we ask, and would you please, by the Spirit, fill us and lead us into all understanding of who our Saviour is in this season.
[4811.56 → 4841.54] And who you are calling us in this season.
[4841.54 → 4871.52] And who you are calling us in this season.

[4901.50 → 4931.48] And we are calling us in this season.
[4931.48 → 4961.46] Because you are calling us in this season.
[4961.46 → 4963.46] Maybe we are calling us in this season.
[4963.46 → 4963.98] Maybe the Lord is calling us in this season.
[4963.98 → 4969.82] season is accentuating that for them. Maybe they are grieving. Maybe, Lord, they are sick.
[4970.54 → 4979.42] Father, would you be near to each of us? Would you be near to us all? I pray that each of us,
[4979.42 → 4986.78] Lord, would leave today rejoicing in the hope that we have in Christ for his glory.
[4987.74 → 4993.82] We pray all these things in the matchless name of Jesus Christ and for his sake. Amen and amen.
[4994.94 → 5001.46] Let's stand. And we'll go out with the Lord's blessing. Before I do that, I want to invite you
[5001.46 → 5008.84] to join us for our fellowship time in the other room to catch up, share a coffee, greet one another,
[5009.10 → 5016.22] and share our lives together. So I invite you to hold out your hands, receive the Lord's greeting.
[5016.76 → 5022.92] The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5022.92 → 5026.96] The Lord lift his face upon you and give you peace. Amen.
