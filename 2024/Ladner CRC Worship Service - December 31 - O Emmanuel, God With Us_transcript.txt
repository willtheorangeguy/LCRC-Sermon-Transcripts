[2910.46 --> 2911.46]  Thank you.
[2939.46 --> 2940.46]  Thank you.
[2940.46 --> 2941.46]  Thank you.
[2969.46 --> 2970.46]  Thank you.
[2970.46 --> 2971.46]  Thank you.
[2999.46 --> 3000.46]  Thank you.
[3000.46 --> 3001.46]  Thank you.
[3029.46 --> 3030.46]  He is God.
[3030.46 --> 3031.46]  He is God.
[3031.46 --> 3032.46]  God.
[3032.46 --> 3033.46]  God.
[3033.46 --> 3034.46]  So, you know,
[3034.46 --> 3035.46]  you're going to be with you.
[3035.46 --> 3036.46]  God.
[3036.46 --> 3037.46]  God is God.
[3037.46 --> 3038.46]  God is God.
[3038.46 --> 3040.46]  God is not a part of God as an ally.
[3040.46 --> 3042.46]  God is a part of God as an ally.
[3042.46 --> 3043.46]  God creates the world in the beginning of the biblical story.
[3043.46 --> 3044.46]  God creates the world.
[3044.46 --> 3045.46]  He doesn't leave it.
[3045.46 --> 3046.46]  Right?
[3046.46 --> 3048.46]  He remains present in it.
[3048.46 --> 3051.46]  Walking in the cool of the day with human beings.
[3051.46 --> 3056.46]  And then after the fall into sin, God goes looking for his people.
[3056.46 --> 3057.46]  Right?
[3057.46 --> 3058.46]  He doesn't leave them.
[3058.46 --> 3059.46]  He doesn't ditch them.
[3059.46 --> 3060.46]  He seeks them out.
[3060.46 --> 3063.46]  He seeks to be with them and for them.
[3063.46 --> 3069.46]  Then after humanity is exiled from the garden, God still pursues them.
[3069.46 --> 3074.46]  He protects Noah and his family through the flood waters.
[3074.46 --> 3079.46]  He visits Abraham and Sarah in their tent and eats with them.
[3079.46 --> 3084.46]  He fights for the freedom of Israel from slavery in Egypt.
[3084.46 --> 3092.46]  He is then present with his people in the wilderness for 40 years in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,
[3092.46 --> 3096.46]  symbolizing the presence of God with them.
[3096.46 --> 3104.46]  And as they enter into the promised land in Canaan, God is still there with him, going before them, fighting for them.
[3104.46 --> 3111.46]  And then even when his people reject him and they try to live without him, they're conquered by the Babylonian Empire.
[3111.46 --> 3115.46]  They get carted off to this immense pagan city of Babylon.
[3115.46 --> 3123.46]  Still, God is with them, going into exile with them, continuing to speak to them through the prophets.
[3123.46 --> 3124.46]  Right?
[3124.46 --> 3137.46]  The story of the Bible over and again, from the Old Testament all the way through to the New Testament, is of God showing up, being with his people, being for his people as an ally.
[3137.46 --> 3138.46]  That's the story of the Bible.
[3138.46 --> 3140.46]  That's the story of the Bible.
[3140.46 --> 3149.46]  And for Christians, we believe that we are still in the story of God, who is an ally for us, who is always with us.
[3149.46 --> 3151.46]  He's always for us.
[3151.46 --> 3161.46]  So when we think about what this name Emmanuel means, God with us, it means that he is for us and that God is an ally.
[3161.46 --> 3169.46]  And that God, he took on flesh and he walked among us and he did it to save us.
[3169.46 --> 3170.46]  Right?
[3170.46 --> 3183.46]  The angel says to Joseph in Matthew 1 21, she will bear a son and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
[3183.46 --> 3184.46]  Right?
[3184.46 --> 3186.46]  Christmas is a rescue mission.
[3186.46 --> 3187.46]  Right?
[3187.46 --> 3194.46]  God comes to enter into the impossible situation of our sin and death that we are trapped in.
[3194.46 --> 3204.46]  You know, Fleming Rutledge has this image where we are, I don't know the word, we are hermetically, what's the word?
[3204.46 --> 3205.46]  Sealed.
[3205.46 --> 3209.46]  Like, you know, sometimes you would seal off a place to keep a virus from coming in.
[3209.46 --> 3214.46]  What she means is that we are sealed with sin and death within.
[3214.46 --> 3216.46]  It's in with us.
[3216.46 --> 3218.46]  You can see I'm off script now.
[3218.46 --> 3223.46]  But see, so God has to come into where we are, into our sin and our death.
[3223.46 --> 3224.46]  And that's what Jesus did.
[3224.46 --> 3225.46]  He came.
[3225.46 --> 3230.46]  We were trapped in this place and he comes to bring deliverance and he comes to us as an ally.
[3230.46 --> 3232.46]  So he is God with us.
[3232.46 --> 3239.46]  Finally, as we consider Jesus as Emmanuel, think about it this way.
[3239.46 --> 3244.46]  He is God with us.
[3244.46 --> 3252.46]  So in the Gospels, the angel appears to Mary and tells her that the power of God is going to come upon her.
[3252.46 --> 3261.46]  That she is going to conceive of a child and it's going to be miraculous and the child is going to be called Emmanuel.
[3261.46 --> 3271.46]  And when you, what you might hear in the words of the angel to Mary is an invitation to trust.
[3271.46 --> 3285.46]  Just like when God sent Isaiah to King Ahaz, when God sent the angel to Mary, it was an invitation to trust that God is with her and that God is for her.
[3285.46 --> 3291.46]  And to her credit, how does Mary respond to God?
[3291.46 --> 3292.46]  She accepts.
[3292.46 --> 3294.46]  She accepts.
[3294.46 --> 3298.46]  She accepts God's invitation to her.
[3298.46 --> 3299.46]  Right?
[3299.46 --> 3303.46]  Mary trusts where Ahaz doubted.
[3303.46 --> 3306.46]  Mary has faith where Ahaz fails.
[3306.46 --> 3307.46]  Right?
[3307.46 --> 3310.46]  Mary is the one who actually shows tremendous courage.
[3310.46 --> 3315.46]  And Ahaz is the one who ends up being a coward.
[3315.46 --> 3320.46]  And friends, the thing is that invitation comes to us as well.
[3320.46 --> 3334.46]  Whenever we encounter Emmanuel, there is embedded in this name, the same invitation that was on offer to Ahaz, and the same invitation that was offered to Mary.
[3334.46 --> 3341.46]  And it is the invitation to trust and to know that God is with you and that he is for you personally.
[3341.46 --> 3350.46]  And so there's this invitation to see God, to understand and to relate to God as an ally who is with you and who is for you.
[3350.46 --> 3356.46]  And that you can know God personally, that you can trust him personally.
[3356.46 --> 3367.46]  And here's the thing, the promise of Emmanuel, God with us, does not guarantee immediate alleviation of all of our hard circumstances.
[3367.46 --> 3368.46]  Right?
[3368.46 --> 3370.46]  It doesn't, and you know that.
[3370.46 --> 3378.46]  But it does guarantee that he is with you and that you are with him and that he will never leave you or forsake you.
[3378.46 --> 3381.46]  And friends, that is the heart of the gospel.
[3381.46 --> 3382.46]  Right?
[3382.46 --> 3384.46]  The gospel is that you and I can be with God.
[3384.46 --> 3391.46]  And if you're united to Jesus in a death like his, you will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
[3391.46 --> 3394.46]  So there's this receiving part of this, right?
[3394.46 --> 3401.46]  Where you have to first receive him, to know him, to accept this invitation, to trust God that he is with you.
[3401.46 --> 3404.46]  And so here's the question first, friends.
[3404.46 --> 3407.46]  Do you know that God is with you?
[3407.46 --> 3420.46]  When we hear this name on Christmas, Emmanuel, God with you, as that came to Ahaz, as that came to Mary, it comes to you, what is your response?
[3420.46 --> 3426.46]  Do you put your trust in God and who he is and his promises?
[3426.46 --> 3427.46]  Do you receive it?
[3427.46 --> 3431.46]  Do you trust that he is for you, your ally?
[3431.46 --> 3440.46]  And then when we were, if you do receive him, our lives then become Emmanuel shaped as well.
[3440.46 --> 3441.46]  And what does that mean?
[3441.46 --> 3446.46]  That means that we show up as allies to others.
[3446.46 --> 3447.46]  Right?
[3447.46 --> 3452.46]  We seek to be with people and for people.
[3452.46 --> 3459.46]  And so think about the relationships that you have in your life.
[3459.46 --> 3471.46]  A relationship you might have with a spouse, with children, with grandchildren, with friends, with neighbors, with coworkers.
[3471.46 --> 3486.46]  And the question is, what might it mean for you to say to that person, I am with you, I am for you, I want to be your ally.
[3486.46 --> 3492.46]  Now maybe you don't say it aloud to the person, that might be a little awkward in some situations, in some relationships.
[3492.46 --> 3498.46]  But whether it's expressed verbally or not, the posture is Emmanuel shaped.
[3498.46 --> 3510.46]  That's who we are called to be as Christians in this world, that we become like Emmanuel, God with us, in that we live in the world with people and for people.
[3510.46 --> 3514.46]  Because everyone needs an ally.
[3514.46 --> 3515.46]  Right?
[3515.46 --> 3521.46]  Every single human being that you interact with is desperate for someone to be in their corner.
[3521.46 --> 3527.46]  And the privilege that we have is to show up as someone who is that.
[3527.46 --> 3528.46]  Right?
[3528.46 --> 3532.46]  As who is that person who is with them and who is for them.
[3532.46 --> 3536.46]  So that then they might see and know that God is with them, that God is for them.
[3539.46 --> 3545.46]  And that brings us back to that scene with the boys in that cave.
[3546.46 --> 3547.46]  Right?
[3547.46 --> 3549.46]  As you're likely aware, what happened?
[3549.46 --> 3550.46]  What happened?
[3550.46 --> 3555.46]  They experienced a miraculous, death-defying rescue.
[3555.46 --> 3556.46]  And here's the thing.
[3556.46 --> 3561.46]  Listen to what happened for this rescue to take place.
[3561.46 --> 3568.46]  An estimated 10,000 people contributed to that effort.
[3568.46 --> 3571.46]  More than 100 divers.
[3571.46 --> 3575.46]  Representatives from like 100 different government agencies.
[3575.46 --> 3577.46]  900 police officers.
[3577.46 --> 3578.46]  2,000 soldiers.
[3578.46 --> 3579.46]  Numerous volunteers.
[3579.46 --> 3594.46]  And then these boys were led out of that murky, dark, winding cave system by expert divers.
[3594.46 --> 3596.46]  Just before another monsoon hit.
[3596.46 --> 3603.46]  And it took an estimated six to eight hours for each boy to make it out.
[3603.46 --> 3611.46]  And these divers, they had to dive and lead the boys in the crawl between the narrowest of spaces.
[3611.46 --> 3614.46]  Some as little as two feet wide.
[3614.46 --> 3619.46]  And all of them were guided along these ropes.
[3619.46 --> 3626.46]  And each child would have a diver in front and a diver behind.
[3626.46 --> 3636.46]  And they would have a diver in front of the people who were holding the oxygen tanks in their mass to make sure that they could be shepherded out.
[3636.46 --> 3638.46]  As one article put it.
[3638.46 --> 3643.46]  And in that process, two rescuers actually lost their lives.
[3643.46 --> 3650.46]  And yet, it was still one of the greatest rescues that the world has ever seen take place.
[3650.46 --> 3651.46]  And friends, you know what?
[3651.46 --> 3652.46]  We marvel at that.
[3652.46 --> 3653.46]  It's amazing.
[3653.46 --> 3654.46]  We celebrate it.
[3654.46 --> 3657.46]  We celebrated it all around the globe.
[3657.46 --> 3668.46]  And in Christmas though, we turn from stories like that to the even more impossible salvation and rescue brought to us in Jesus Christ.
[3668.46 --> 3674.46]  Who entered into the caves of darkness and helplessness that we live in.
[3675.46 --> 3682.46]  And gave his very life that we might be rescued from our own darkness of sin and death.
[3682.46 --> 3685.46]  He is Emmanuel, God with us.
[3685.46 --> 3686.46]  He is before us.
[3686.46 --> 3687.46]  He is behind us.
[3687.46 --> 3689.46]  He is hemming us in.
[3689.46 --> 3694.46]  He is with us every step of the way, never to leave us, never to forsake us.
[3694.46 --> 3699.46]  And he is with us in such a way that not even death itself can snatch us out of his hands.
[3701.46 --> 3702.46]  Right?
[3702.46 --> 3708.46]  In Jesus, God offers himself to us as our ally.
[3708.46 --> 3714.46]  And he invites us to trust that he is present with us and that he is for us.
[3714.46 --> 3723.46]  And if you and I respond in the way of Mary and not in the way of Ahaz, then we become ones who also bear God.
[3723.46 --> 3731.46]  We bear God, his withness, his presence, his foreignness, his alliance, the alliance of God.
[3731.46 --> 3734.46]  We bear it to our neighbors and to our city.
[3734.46 --> 3737.46]  So let's pray.
[3737.46 --> 3739.46]  Let's pray together that God would help us.
[3739.46 --> 3740.46]  We pray.
[3740.46 --> 3741.46]  Oh, Emmanuel.
[3741.46 --> 3742.46]  Would you come to us?
[3742.46 --> 3757.46]  And we need the true king, the king of the nations to lead us.
[3757.46 --> 3762.46]  We need light, the day spring, to bring us out of darkness.
[3762.46 --> 3767.46]  We need the key of David to unlock our prisons.
[3767.46 --> 3770.46]  And the root of Jesse to graft us into your love.
[3770.46 --> 3774.46]  And we need the mighty Lord to protect us.
[3774.46 --> 3776.46]  And we need wisdom to be our guide.
[3776.46 --> 3781.46]  And all of this is fulfilled in Jesus, who is Emmanuel, God with us.
[3781.46 --> 3788.46]  And so, Lord, Holy Spirit, would you help us to receive him as our savior?
[3788.46 --> 3794.46]  And then would you help us to be Emmanuel shaped, bearers of God's presence into the world?
[3794.46 --> 3797.46]  We pray all this in Jesus' holy name.
[3797.46 --> 3798.46]  Amen.
[3798.46 --> 3799.46]  All right.
[3799.46 --> 3802.46]  So we are going to sing, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
[3802.46 --> 3804.46]  And Mary and I talked about it.
[3804.46 --> 3806.46]  We're not going to sing all seven verses.
[3806.46 --> 3807.46]  Don't worry.
[3807.46 --> 3811.46]  But we're just going to sing the one, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
[3811.46 --> 3813.46]  And then we're going to kind of go flow into another song.
[3813.46 --> 3816.46]  So please stand and we'll sing together.
[3837.46 --> 3838.46]  Lord, we're just going to sing together.
[3838.46 --> 3843.46]  And we're going to sing together.
[3843.46 --> 3844.46]  And there will be other songs.
[3844.46 --> 3846.46]  And we'll sing together.
[3846.46 --> 3849.46]  If we do song with Emmanuel, love you and are Jeb, Emmanuel, God with us.
[3849.46 --> 3850.46]  And then we estudio our Coffee with Emmanuel Sister.
[3850.46 --> 3851.46]  And we're going to sing together.
[3851.46 --> 3855.46]  And memories of Clinicaler, habit prepare thee to worship next year.
[3855.46 --> 3862.46]  Jesus Christ, we askwoman先生, who is Emmanuel, Jesus.
[3862.46 --> 3863.46]  All right.
[3863.46 --> 3864.46]  There are few Republican men that may be.
[3864.46 --> 3884.46]  O God, we can't help you out, that rassom, captive Israel, that rising of the exile here,
[3884.46 --> 3906.06]  until the Son of God appear. Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3906.06 --> 3921.42]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3921.42 --> 3948.36]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel, His name is God.
[3948.36 --> 3967.36]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Lord, in love, revealed in love, His name is God.
[3967.36 --> 3985.36]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel, His name is God.
[3985.36 --> 3992.60]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Allah.
[3992.60 --> 4004.26]  Come with us, revealed in love, His name is God.
[4004.26 --> 4006.70]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel.
[4006.70 --> 4010.06]  Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel, cómo.
[4010.06 --> 4027.30]  So we come to the time of our worship where we give of our tithes and our offerings back to God.
[4027.30 --> 4036.50]  Everything that we have is from him and we worship him by acknowledging that and giving to the cause of his kingdom in the world.
[4036.50 --> 4043.50]  And before we do, actually, Marian is going to introduce a new song right now.
[4043.50 --> 4051.50]  This is a song that I found a few weeks ago and I thought it was so beautiful.
[4051.50 --> 4053.50]  It's called Glory, Let There Be Peace.
[4053.50 --> 4058.50]  And you probably don't know it, so you're invited just to read the words on the screen.
[4058.50 --> 4061.50]  I don't want you to miss these beautiful words.
[4061.50 --> 4066.50]  And if at some point you feel comfortable singing the chorus with us, please do.
[4066.50 --> 4075.50]  The starlets in the darkness shines with the promise,
[4075.50 --> 4076.50]  Manuel.
[4076.50 --> 4078.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4078.50 --> 4079.50]  Manuel.
[4079.50 --> 4080.50]  The starlets in the darkness shines with the promise,
[4080.50 --> 4081.50]  Manuel.
[4081.50 --> 4088.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4088.50 --> 4089.50]  Manuel.
[4089.50 --> 4090.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4090.50 --> 4091.50]  Manuel.
[4091.50 --> 4092.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4092.50 --> 4096.50]  Manuel.
[4096.50 --> 4105.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4105.50 --> 4106.50]  Manuel.
[4106.50 --> 4116.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4116.50 --> 4119.50]  Manuel.
[4119.50 --> 4122.50]  One child born in the stillness living within us,
[4122.50 --> 4124.50]  in glory
[4124.50 --> 4126.50]  glory
[4126.50 --> 4128.50]  glory
[4128.50 --> 4130.50]  let it heavy
[4130.50 --> 4132.50]  reach
[4132.50 --> 4134.50]  let it start in
[4134.50 --> 4136.50]  peace
[4136.50 --> 4138.50]  and that speaks
[4138.50 --> 4140.50]  for the voice
[4140.50 --> 4142.50]  that holds for the
[4142.50 --> 4144.50]  hope that man
[4144.50 --> 4146.50]  who knows
[4146.50 --> 4150.50]  one God
[4150.50 --> 4152.50]  brings us together
[4152.50 --> 4154.50]  now and
[4154.50 --> 4156.50]  forever
[4156.50 --> 4158.50]  and new
[4158.50 --> 4160.50]  well
[4160.50 --> 4162.50]  sing in glory

[4164.50 --> 4168.50]  let there be
[4168.50 --> 4170.50]  peace

[4178.50 --> 4182.50]  let there be peace
[4182.50 --> 4184.50]  let it start in
[4184.50 --> 4186.50]  me

[4192.50 --> 4194.50]  is strong
[4194.50 --> 4196.50]  enough
[4196.50 --> 4198.50]  to save us
[4198.50 --> 4200.50]  nothing
[4200.50 --> 4202.50]  still
[4202.50 --> 4204.50]  nothing
[4204.50 --> 4206.50]  stands in the way
[4206.50 --> 4208.50]  his love
[4208.50 --> 4210.50]  is strong
[4210.50 --> 4212.50]  enough
[4212.50 --> 4214.50]  to save us
[4214.50 --> 4216.50]  nothing

[4304.50 --> 4306.50]  thank you
[4306.50 --> 4308.50]  it's very lovely
[4308.50 --> 4310.50]  so we will
[4310.50 --> 4312.50]  lift our hearts
[4312.50 --> 4314.50]  and our requests
[4314.50 --> 4316.50]  to God in a prayer of supplication
[4316.50 --> 4318.50]  before we do I have
[4318.50 --> 4320.50]  an announcement to make
[4320.50 --> 4322.50]  that today we will
[4322.50 --> 4324.50]  especially pray for
[4324.50 --> 4326.50]  Jason and Michaela
[4326.50 --> 4328.50]  and they sent me an email yesterday
[4328.50 --> 4332.50]  and wanted to share the very sad news with us their church family
[4332.50 --> 4334.50]  that due to complications
[4334.50 --> 4336.50]  Michaela's pregnancy
[4336.50 --> 4338.50]  resulted in stillbirth
[4338.50 --> 4340.50]  at 23 weeks
[4342.50 --> 4344.50]  their son
[4344.50 --> 4346.50]  Samuel
[4346.50 --> 4348.50]  Joseph Van Ryn
[4348.50 --> 4350.50]  was greatly loved by his family
[4350.50 --> 4352.50]  at this time they
[4352.50 --> 4354.50]  would appreciate our prayers
[4354.50 --> 4356.50]  but also
[4356.50 --> 4358.50]  some space to grieve
[4358.50 --> 4360.50]  so let us pray
[4360.50 --> 4362.50]  together we'll pray for them
[4362.50 --> 4364.50]  and other things and we will also conclude
[4364.50 --> 4366.50]  by saying the Lord's Prayer together
[4366.50 --> 4368.50]  let us pray
[4378.50 --> 4380.50]  Lord first of all we
[4380.50 --> 4382.50]  come before you
[4382.50 --> 4384.50]  and
[4384.50 --> 4386.50]  we lift up
[4386.50 --> 4390.50]  Jason and Michaela to you
[4390.50 --> 4392.50]  oh Lord you know
[4392.50 --> 4394.50]  the pain and the heaviness
[4394.50 --> 4396.50]  of their hearts
[4396.50 --> 4398.50]  you know the loss that they are experiencing
[4398.50 --> 4400.50]  you experienced it yourself
[4400.50 --> 4404.50]  we ask Lord that in your mercy
[4404.50 --> 4406.50]  that you would comfort them both
[4406.50 --> 4408.50]  during this time of mourning
[4408.50 --> 4410.50]  we thank you Lord
[4410.50 --> 4414.50]  that you are the God who binds up the broken hearted
[4414.50 --> 4416.50]  that you
[4416.50 --> 4418.50]  do not let one
[4418.50 --> 4420.50]  tear fall
[4420.50 --> 4422.50]  without catching it
[4422.50 --> 4424.50]  as you say in the Psalms
[4424.50 --> 4426.50]  in your bottle
[4426.50 --> 4428.50]  so Lord would you be with them
[4428.50 --> 4430.50]  in a special way now
[4430.50 --> 4432.50]  Lord would you be their shepherd
[4432.50 --> 4434.50]  the one who is
[4434.50 --> 4436.50]  before them and behind them
[4436.50 --> 4438.50]  and hemming them in
[4438.50 --> 4440.50]  Lord we thank you that
[4440.50 --> 4442.50]  even in the midst of
[4442.50 --> 4444.50]  these kinds of
[4444.50 --> 4446.50]  tragic situations in this life
[4446.50 --> 4448.50]  that you never leave us
[4448.50 --> 4450.50]  you never forsake us
[4452.50 --> 4454.50]  and our Father and our God
[4454.50 --> 4456.50]  we also we remember again
[4456.50 --> 4458.50]  as we've have already this morning
[4458.50 --> 4460.50]  the words of the prophet Isaiah
[4460.50 --> 4464.50]  who said the people who walked in darkness
[4464.50 --> 4466.50]  have seen a great light
[4466.50 --> 4470.50]  those who dwell in the land of deep darkness
[4470.50 --> 4474.50]  on them has light shown
[4474.50 --> 4478.50]  so Lord we thank you for coming as the light
[4478.50 --> 4480.50]  into our darkness to rescue us
[4480.50 --> 4484.50]  we pray for your light to shine into
[4484.50 --> 4486.50]  the darkness of human hearts
[4486.50 --> 4488.50]  and the darkness of this world
[4488.50 --> 4492.50]  Lord we pray that you would shine your light into
[4492.50 --> 4494.50]  human hearts that don't yet know you
[4494.50 --> 4498.50]  so that many men and women and children
[4498.50 --> 4500.50]  would hear the words of Jesus who said
[4500.50 --> 4502.50]  come follow me
[4502.50 --> 4504.50]  follow me
[4504.50 --> 4506.50]  and who said I give life
[4506.50 --> 4508.50]  and give it abundantly
[4508.50 --> 4510.50]  and in hearing my words
[4510.50 --> 4512.50]  you will have joy
[4512.50 --> 4514.50]  so Lord we pray that you would send
[4514.50 --> 4516.50]  your Holy Spirit into this world
[4516.50 --> 4518.50]  to convict the world of sin
[4518.50 --> 4520.50]  of righteousness and of judgment
[4520.50 --> 4522.50]  so that many would turn to you as their savior
[4522.50 --> 4526.50]  for you came to be with them and for them
[4526.50 --> 4530.50]  also Lord we pray that you would shine your light
[4530.50 --> 4532.50]  into the darkness and evil of this world
[4532.50 --> 4534.50]  would you bring hope
[4534.50 --> 4536.50]  to the hopeless
[4536.50 --> 4540.50]  justice to those treated unjustly
[4540.50 --> 4542.50]  mercy to those who need mercy
[4542.50 --> 4544.50]  grace to those who need grace
[4544.50 --> 4548.50]  Lord we remember the words of the prophet Isaiah
[4548.50 --> 4552.50]  for to us a child is born
[4552.50 --> 4554.50]  to us a son is given
[4554.50 --> 4556.50]  and the government will be on his shoulders
[4556.50 --> 4558.50]  and he will be called
[4558.50 --> 4560.50]  wonderful counselor
[4560.50 --> 4562.50]  mighty God everlasting father
[4562.50 --> 4564.50]  prince of peace
[4564.50 --> 4568.50]  as our wonderful counselor
[4568.50 --> 4570.50]  we ask that you would provide wisdom
[4570.50 --> 4572.50]  and counsel
[4572.50 --> 4578.50]  that we would make good decisions as we seek to follow your will in our lives
[4578.50 --> 4580.50]  grant us wisdom
[4580.50 --> 4586.50]  not only as individuals and for whatever choices decisions that we are facing in our lives
[4586.50 --> 4592.50]  but as well Lord give us wisdom as a congregation
[4592.50 --> 4594.50]  lead us we pray to walk in your ways
[4594.50 --> 4596.50]  to follow the steps of our savior
[4596.50 --> 4604.50]  we pray for the leaders of our church that you would guide our elders and deacons according to your will in the coming year
[4604.50 --> 4608.50]  as our mighty God
[4608.50 --> 4610.50]  would you act to heal and restore
[4610.50 --> 4614.50]  Lord be with those
[4614.50 --> 4616.50]  going through surgeries
[4616.50 --> 4618.50]  and medical treatments
[4618.50 --> 4620.50]  Lord
[4620.50 --> 4622.50]  there are those in our congregation
[4622.50 --> 4624.50]  who you know
[4624.50 --> 4626.50]  and Lord that is on
[4626.50 --> 4628.50]  all of our hearts
[4628.50 --> 4630.50]  Lord that they need your healing
[4630.50 --> 4632.50]  presence in their lives they need you to come
[4632.50 --> 4634.50]  and act and heal
[4634.50 --> 4636.50]  so Lord would you pray we pray that you'd be with
[4636.50 --> 4638.50]  those who need
[4638.50 --> 4640.50]  your healing in their lives
[4640.50 --> 4642.50]  and Lord would you use medical treatments
[4642.50 --> 4644.50]  that are available
[4644.50 --> 4646.50]  Lord to bring healing
[4646.50 --> 4648.50]  and to eradicate
[4648.50 --> 4650.50]  any disease that is in us
[4652.50 --> 4654.50]  and you are our everlasting father
[4656.50 --> 4660.50]  remind us that nothing can separate us from your love
[4660.50 --> 4662.50]  we pray Lord for those who are lonely at this time of year
[4662.50 --> 4666.50]  perhaps especially with a recent loss of a loved one
[4666.50 --> 4668.50]  would you be an ever present comfort and help with them
[4670.50 --> 4674.50]  and finally Jesus we thank you that you are our Prince of Peace
[4674.50 --> 4676.50]  we pray that you would bring peace to this world
[4676.50 --> 4680.50]  not only reconciling sinners to yourself
[4680.50 --> 4682.50]  but also Lord would you bring war and conflict to an end
[4682.50 --> 4684.50]  especially the war in Ukraine and Gaza
[4684.50 --> 4686.50]  also bring healing and restoration
[4686.50 --> 4688.50]  also bring healing and restoration
[4688.50 --> 4690.50]  to our relationships that are broken or strained
[4690.50 --> 4694.50]  and in all of this Jesus we thank you that you are our light
[4694.50 --> 4696.50]  and that you are our very life
[4696.50 --> 4698.50]  and we pray together in the words that you taught us
[4698.50 --> 4700.50]  saying together
[4700.50 --> 4702.50]  our father who art in heaven
[4702.50 --> 4706.50]  our father who art in heaven
[4706.50 --> 4708.50]  hallowed be thy name
[4708.50 --> 4710.50]  thy kingdom come
[4710.50 --> 4712.50]  thy will be done
[4712.50 --> 4714.50]  on earth as it is in heaven
[4714.50 --> 4716.50]  give us this day our daily bread
[4716.50 --> 4718.50]  and forgive us our trespasses
[4718.50 --> 4722.50]  as we forgive those who trespass against us
