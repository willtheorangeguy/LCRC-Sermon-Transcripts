[296.86 → 298.30] Good morning to you all.
[298.30 → 299.30] Good morning.
[299.30 → 303.50] Welcome to worship on this Lord's Day at Latiner Christian Reformed Church.
[303.50 → 314.74] Whether this is your first time visiting us or whether you are a regular member of our church community, we are pleased to gather together this morning for worship.
[314.74 → 320.62] We are in the season of the church calendar called Eastertide.
[320.62 → 322.56] It's a period of 50 days.
[323.56 → 331.28] And the resurrection presence of Jesus actually permeates our entire Christian lives.
[332.36 → 335.02] And we say, Christ is risen.
[335.80 → 337.00] He is risen indeed.
[339.38 → 340.60] Oh, let's do it again.
[341.22 → 341.62] Ready?
[342.62 → 343.70] Christ is risen.
[343.70 → 345.70] He is risen indeed.
[345.70 → 346.82] I love you.
[347.24 → 348.24] That was pretty good.
[348.88 → 351.28] I bet the third time it would be even better.
[351.72 → 353.36] But we'll save that.
[355.16 → 359.16] So Christ, the risen Christ, is the one whom we worship.
[359.98 → 361.96] And he is the one we worship today.
[362.14 → 368.12] And so men, women, and children of God, please rise in body or in spirit for our call to worship.
[368.74 → 370.72] We'll read it responsibly together.
[370.72 → 376.58] Sing to the Lord a new song for he has done marvellous things.
[376.58 → 379.78] Shout for joy to the Lord.
[379.98 → 384.42] All the earth burst into jubilant song with music.
[384.98 → 389.62] Let the sea resound and everything in it, the world and all who live in it.
[389.62 → 393.00] Let the rivers clap their hands.
[393.00 → 396.34] Let the mountains sing together for joy.
[396.88 → 401.48] Let them sing before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
[402.14 → 407.94] He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.
[407.94 → 418.66] Heavenly Father, we praise you for giving your son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[419.40 → 425.94] We thank you that he came, and he stands before every human heart offering his resurrection life.
[426.84 → 430.32] Father, you change every landscape to joy.
[430.32 → 435.56] You bring down every wall that divides your human family that you have made.
[436.26 → 438.72] The wounds of the cross have made us whole.
[439.32 → 441.66] The whole earth trembles at what you have done.
[442.28 → 447.34] And yet you come to each of us tenderly with an invitation to follow you.
[447.90 → 451.42] And there is no other name under heaven by which we are saved.
[451.90 → 453.40] Glory to you, Lord Christ.
[453.40 → 460.14] We pray, Holy Spirit, Spirit of life, that you would dwell with us in this time together
[460.14 → 465.48] as we worship you and seek to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[466.10 → 471.62] For to you, O Lord, belong all honour and glory and praise on earth and in heaven, now and forever.
[472.40 → 472.78] Amen.
[473.78 → 478.74] So the Lord greets us with these words from Psalm 98 as well.
[478.74 → 483.40] The Lord has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel.
[484.14 → 488.84] All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[489.72 → 495.02] So as the Lord has called us on this sunny morning to come and worship, and he's greeted us,
[495.38 → 497.02] let's turn and let's welcome one another.
[498.70 → 499.36] Go ahead.
[499.36 → 499.42] Amen.
[499.42 → 499.92] Amen.
[508.74 → 509.74] Amen.
[538.74 → 556.34] Morning by morning we see God's mercies, and today we can sing with all our hearts,
[556.34 → 559.30] great is thy faithfulness.
[559.30 → 575.88] Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[575.88 → 583.32] There is no shadow turning with thee.
[583.32 → 613.30] God's mercies and today we can sing with you.
[613.30 → 643.28] God's mercies and today we can sing with you.
[643.28 → 673.26] God's mercies and today we can sing with you.
[673.26 → 678.84] God's mercies and today we can sing with you.
[679.10 → 680.06] Amen.
[680.06 → 681.26] Amen.
[681.26 → 684.06] 색
[711.26 → 722.26] I hope for tomorrow, the sins of our hearts, with ten thousand each side.
[722.26 → 730.26] May the sun shake my hand, may the sun shake my hand,
[730.26 → 737.26] for ten thousand each side.
[737.26 → 757.26] May the sun shake my hand, may the sun shake my hand, may the sun shake my hand.
[757.26 → 763.26] Thank you. Remain standing for our next song, Jesus strong and kind.
[763.26 → 767.26] However we come into the building today where our hearts are,
[767.26 → 771.26] we come to a Lord who is both strong and able to meet us,
[771.26 → 775.26] and kind and welcoming no matter how we have entered.
[775.26 → 784.26] And we'll continue this exchange of leadership between the languages, English and Mandarin.
[784.26 → 789.26] Sing your whole verse, whichever language you embrace,
[789.26 → 795.26] and we'll sing all together but just we'll alternate from the front here in leadership.
[795.26 → 801.26] But feel free to sing out fully on all the verses and the choruses.
[801.26 → 829.26] Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to it.
[829.26 → 839.26] No one else can satisfy, I should come to it.
[839.26 → 845.26] Jesus said that if I thirst, I will commit to it.
[845.26 → 849.26] If I thirst, I will continue to it.
[849.26 → 851.26] No one else can satisfy, I will continue to it.
[851.26 → 856.26] No one else can satisfy, I will continue to it.
[856.26 → 886.24] Thank you.
[886.26 → 888.46] Jesus said,
[888.52 → 891.00] But if I feel,
[891.38 → 895.46] I should come to Him.
[895.86 → 900.44] No one else can be my shield,
[900.90 → 904.56] I should come to Him.
[905.16 → 909.34] For the poor is good and safe,
[909.34 → 912.38] No one else can be my shield,
[912.38 → 914.24] I should come to Him.
[914.24 → 922.64] With all the Trubbish convey I need,
[922.64 → 938.56] Each o'er has to here
[938.56 → 949.98] In the blood, I mean that He will be recognized.
[950.00 → 958.82] There are so bald runs whom I wear,
[958.82 → 964.78] Whatever they might scan on Stefano,
[964.78 → 968.50] These are so perfect.
[968.50 → 973.50] For the Lord is the Lord and the Lord is the Lord.
[973.50 → 977.50] And we keep your way of life.
[977.50 → 983.50] We've been told in the long time to get some.
[983.50 → 987.50] Jesus is the God.
[987.50 → 993.50] Jesus is the God.
[998.50 → 1005.50] Thank you.
[1005.50 → 1012.50] We come now to our time of confession.
[1012.50 → 1018.50] And as we just sang, we can run to Jesus because he is strong and kind.
[1018.50 → 1020.50] He is merciful.
[1020.50 → 1029.50] And we can boldly approach him confessing our sins, our struggles, and seeking his forgiveness.
[1029.50 → 1037.50] So first, I will give you a moment to silently confess your own personal sins to God.
[1037.50 → 1039.50] And then I will close us in prayer.
[1039.50 → 1044.50] So first, I'll give you a moment of silence, of silent confession.
[1044.50 → 1064.50] Let's pray together.
[1064.50 → 1075.50] Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid.
[1075.50 → 1083.50] We pray for your forgiveness for the thoughts, words, and deeds that offend against your good and holy laws.
[1083.50 → 1094.50] And we ask that by the presence and power of your Holy Spirit, that you would help us to perfectly love you and worthily magnify your holy name through Christ our Lord.
[1094.50 → 1097.50] Amen.
[1097.50 → 1104.50] So God looks upon us in mercy because of what Christ has done for us.
[1104.50 → 1113.50] So here are these words where God assures us of his pardon from 1 Peter 1.
[1113.50 → 1125.50] For you know that it was not with perishable things, such as silver or gold, that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors.
[1125.50 → 1132.50] But with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
[1132.50 → 1140.50] He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
[1140.50 → 1146.50] Through him, you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him.
[1146.50 → 1151.50] And so your faith and hope are in God.
[1151.50 → 1152.50] Thanks be to God.
[1152.50 → 1153.50] Amen.
[1153.50 → 1154.50] Amen.
[1154.50 → 1158.50] Amen.
[1158.50 → 1159.50] Amen.
[1159.50 → 1160.50] Amen.
[1160.50 → 1162.50] Amen.
[1163.50 → 1164.50] Amen.
[1164.50 → 1165.50] Amen.
[1165.50 → 1166.50] Amen.
[1166.50 → 1167.50] Amen.
[1167.50 → 1169.50] O, what a good taste of glory divine.
[1169.50 → 1172.50] And so His glory is a great command, and so His glory is second.
[1172.50 → 1173.50] Amen.
[1173.50 → 1174.50] Amen.
[1174.50 → 1175.50] Amen.
[1175.50 → 1176.50] Amen.
[1176.50 → 1177.50] Amen.
[1177.50 → 1178.50] Amen.
[1178.50 → 1180.50] Amen.
[1180.50 → 1181.50] Amen.
[1181.50 → 1182.50] Amen.
[1182.50 → 1191.04] Did us not where they shall
[1191.04 → 1221.02] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1221.04 → 1251.02] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1251.04 → 1257.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1258.04 → 1263.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1263.04 → 1265.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1265.04 → 1269.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1269.04 → 1271.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1271.04 → 1277.04] The lips of His shone, all is at rest.
[1278.04 → 1283.04] High in my stator, I'm happy and blessed.
[1283.04 → 1285.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1285.04 → 1289.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1289.04 → 1291.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1291.04 → 1295.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1295.04 → 1297.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1297.04 → 1299.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1299.04 → 1301.04] The Lord washed in His blood.
[1301.04 → 1303.04] Amen.
[1331.04 → 1333.04] Amen.
[1349.04 → 1353.14] Brothers and sisters, this is the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1353.96 → 1357.14] And this is the table where we run to him.
[1357.14 → 1363.30] We run to him boldly with our sin, with our shame.
[1364.32 → 1372.20] And because it's at this table that we see tangibly and taste and feel the forgiveness of Jesus.
[1373.82 → 1376.64] His body was given up for us.
[1376.70 → 1382.52] His blood was shed for us to take the full and complete judgment of our sin.
[1382.76 → 1386.06] So that we might then have life in him.
[1386.06 → 1395.08] The scriptures say that when we receive the bread and wine, we actually participate in the life of Jesus.
[1395.80 → 1404.52] We are actually fed as we tangibly taste and feel the goodness and the grace of Christ.
[1404.52 → 1414.52] And so if this is not your faith, if you have not professed your faith in Jesus and publicly have been baptized into a local church,
[1414.76 → 1419.68] then please do not receive this meal even as it is passed to you.
[1420.22 → 1426.88] But we invite you to use this time to consider the free offer of forgiveness that Jesus provides.
[1426.88 → 1427.88] And we invite you to run to him today.
[1427.88 → 1429.56] And we invite you to run to him today.
[1430.16 → 1431.92] And to receive his forgiveness.
[1432.86 → 1440.58] If you are a believer, if you have received Christ as Lord and have been baptized into a church,
[1441.10 → 1442.64] then this meal is for you.
[1443.18 → 1445.44] And he invites you to come.
[1445.44 → 1460.06] For parents with children, we believe that it is your responsibility to judge whether your child is ready to receive the sacrament in an age-appropriate way.
[1460.40 → 1465.94] And if you have more questions about that, probably not right now, but later, talk to me about it.
[1466.04 → 1468.60] And we can kind of get us prepared for next time.
[1468.60 → 1478.12] So brothers and sisters, hear these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper.
[1478.56 → 1482.36] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1483.02 → 1486.38] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1486.66 → 1488.44] This is my body, which is for you.
[1489.28 → 1491.12] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1492.06 → 1495.24] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1495.24 → 1498.34] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1499.14 → 1503.74] For as often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1504.50 → 1510.52] For whenever you eat this bread, and you drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[1511.50 → 1517.76] So brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, the people of God.
[1518.62 → 1520.70] So come and feed on Christ.
[1520.70 → 1524.28] Feed on him in your hearts with Thanksgiving.
[1525.06 → 1530.44] And drink, knowing that the blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of all of your sins.
[1531.40 → 1535.78] So I'd like to invite some of our elders and deacons to help me serve the elements.
[1535.78 → 1543.78] Amen.

[1738.68 → 1739.68] Amen.
[1741.68 → 1744.68] Brothers and sisters, this is the body of Christ broken for you.
[1744.68 → 1746.68] Let's eat together.
[1758.68 → 1760.68] Amen.

[1976.10 → 1979.54] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[1979.94 → 1980.76] Let's drink together.
[1991.76 → 1992.58] Let's pray.
[1992.58 → 2002.04] Our gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you for your kindness to us, your love that you pour out upon us.
[2002.56 → 2015.82] And we thank you for these tangible gifts of your grace that teach us, that remind us that our Lord Jesus, our Saviour, gave himself for us.
[2015.82 → 2025.16] His broken body, his shed blood for the forgiveness of all of our sins so that we could be set free, so that we might have life and life eternal.
[2025.98 → 2035.68] And Father, as you strengthen us by your grace, would you help us to live for you, to follow you, to honour and glorify you in all that we do.
[2035.68 → 2036.92] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2037.38 → 2037.56] Amen.

[2075.70 → 2076.04] I do there's a question.
[2076.04 → 2077.04] But there's a question, I mean, the question was destroyed.
[2077.04 → 2078.04] Somebody's mentioned the question, the what I'm looking for.
[2078.04 → 2079.04] He actually made.
[2079.04 → 2079.76] I'm really pleased for her to answer.
[2079.76 → 2081.92] This is not as little as important as they made my turning off on Senate BC is as impossible.
[2081.92 → 2082.76] OK.
[2082.76 → 2082.92] But, then, there's the room that the room is perfect for you to am �'s going to be able to turn
[2082.92 → 2088.60] There you go. Are we all settled? Hopefully my microphone will be okay.
[2089.88 → 2093.80] All right, nice to see you all. How are you all today? Good? Is everyone good?
[2095.00 → 2101.96] I like to do puzzles. Do you like to do puzzles? Yeah? I bet some of the adults like to do puzzles
[2101.96 → 2109.72] too. Anybody like to do puzzles? Yeah, look at them all. Puzzles are fun. I have a children's
[2109.72 → 2112.92] puzzle, and you know it's a children's puzzle because it's big. It has nice big pictures.
[2115.16 → 2121.64] Yeah, so it's huge. And so puzzles are really fun because you take all these pictures,
[2121.64 → 2126.04] and when you have one picture, you can't really necessarily tell what it's about,
[2126.52 → 2129.96] but when you put all the puzzles together, what happens?
[2133.32 → 2139.56] You can see when it's all together. That's exactly right. Now, sometimes the Bible can be like this.
[2140.04 → 2142.12] So I want to tell you a little story.
[2144.12 → 2154.92] Rose from the dead. He was in a real body, and one day he was in a real body, and he saw some of his
[2154.92 → 2160.36] disciples, and they were really kind of confused. They're like only seeing one piece of the puzzle.
[2160.36 → 2166.20] They didn't really see the big picture about who Jesus was and what's going on. So Jesus appeared to
[2166.20 → 2173.56] them, and he said this, this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled
[2173.56 → 2180.52] that is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms. Then he opened their minds
[2180.52 → 2190.84] so that they could understand the scriptures. And so now, so Jesus told them how they can understand
[2190.84 → 2196.44] the scriptures. And how do you think that was? How can we understand the Bible? You know,
[2196.44 → 2201.88] in the Bible we read all kinds of stories. Sometimes we don't all these pieces of the puzzle fit together.
[2201.88 → 2208.20] So do you, have you all seen this book before? The Jesus Storybook Bible? Maybe you've read it. You do? Yeah.
[2208.20 → 2218.52] So I want to read just a little, two pages.
[2218.52 → 2231.48] Yeah. Now, I think the Bible is what you shouldn't do. The Bible certainly does have some rules.
[2231.48 → 2237.40] They show you how you do what works best. But the Bible is not mainly about you and what you should do.
[2237.40 → 2243.32] It's about God and what he has done. Other people think the Bible is a book of heroes,
[2243.32 → 2249.16] showing you people you should copy. The Bible does have some heroes in it, but most of the people in
[2249.16 → 2253.48] the Bible aren't heroes at all. They make some big mistakes. They get a friend.
[2253.48 → 2263.72] Some of the Bible is very mean. No, the Bible isn't a book of heroes. The Bible is most of all a story.
[2267.24 → 2275.24] About a young hero who comes from a far away country to win back his lost treasure. It's a love story
[2275.24 → 2282.04] about a young man who leaves his throne, everything to rescue the one he loves. It's like the most
[2282.04 → 2289.24] wonderful of fairy tale stories that has come true in real life. You see, the best thing about this story
[2289.24 → 2295.48] is its true. There are lots of stories in the Bible, but all the stories are telling one big story.
[2296.28 → 2300.68] The story of how God loves his children and comes to rescue them.
[2300.68 → 2309.16] He, Jesus, is like the missing piece in a puzzle. The pieces that make all the other pieces fit together.
[2310.28 → 2315.64] Okay, so all the stories in the Bible we read are like all of these pieces, but when we put them
[2315.64 → 2323.72] together, what do we see? We see them all together and the picture we see is Jesus. Because Jesus is what
[2323.72 → 2328.52] the Bible is all about. Okay, can you remember that? So when you see a puzzle, and you're working a puzzle,
[2328.52 → 2335.08] you can remember that the Bible is like a puzzle, and we put them all together, we see Jesus. Okay?
[2336.52 → 2338.44] Got it? Yeah, all right.
[2343.72 → 2348.44] Okay, let's pray together. Lord, help us as we read all the different stories in the Bible
[2348.44 → 2354.84] to see you clearly so that we know that the Bible is all about Jesus and how he loves us and what he has
[2354.84 → 2359.80] done to save us. Lord, help us to know you and follow you. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2360.68 → 2364.76] All right. So you all can go to your Sunday school classes.
[2364.76 → 2374.62] Our love is for you.
[2374.76 → 2376.90] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2377.40 → 2378.76] Amen.
[2378.76 → 2379.06] Amen.
[2379.06 → 2379.62] Amen.
[2379.90 → 2381.28] Amen.
[2381.30 → 2382.84] Amen.
[2382.84 → 2384.76] Amen.
[2387.56 → 2388.32] Amen.
[2388.32 → 2389.92] Ole.
[2389.92 → 2390.44] Amen.
[2390.44 → 2392.08] Amen.
[2392.08 → 2393.58] Amen.
[2393.58 → 2414.62] All right, good morning again.
[2414.62 → 2444.60] All right, good morning.
[2444.62 → 2460.80] Now, today we are going to look at a very kind of well-known story, and it's a story that deals with the topic or the themes of doubt and belief.
[2461.40 → 2465.08] Okay, doubt and belief and how those two are often are intertwined.
[2465.08 → 2474.20] And we're going to see how the presence of the risen Jesus restores belief in one of his disciples named Thomas.
[2474.76 → 2481.56] Or as he has been called throughout the centuries in a kind of very bummer of a nickname, Doubting Thomas.
[2482.12 → 2482.90] Have you all heard that?
[2483.74 → 2485.76] Okay, so poor Doubting Thomas.
[2485.90 → 2487.40] But let's read his story together.
[2487.40 → 2489.66] We'll read.
[2490.38 → 2493.18] The scripture will be on the screen here behind me.
[2493.68 → 2497.34] And the scripture is John 20, verses 24 to 31.
[2497.46 → 2499.10] If you have a Bible, you can feel free to open it.
[2499.50 → 2502.90] John 20, verses 24 to 31.
[2502.90 → 2523.84] Okay, that's on page 808 of your pre-Bible.
[2523.84 → 2528.44] All right, John 20, 24 to 31.
[2529.40 → 2535.64] Now Thomas, called Didymous, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
[2536.06 → 2538.76] So the other disciples told him, we have seen the Lord.
[2539.92 → 2549.38] But he said to them, unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
[2549.38 → 2555.34] A week later, his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.
[2556.14 → 2562.20] Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, peace be with you.
[2563.06 → 2567.44] Then he said to Thomas, put your finger here.
[2568.18 → 2569.32] See my hands.
[2569.78 → 2572.04] Reach out your hand and put it into my side.
[2572.40 → 2573.94] Stop doubting and believe.
[2574.68 → 2578.40] Thomas said to him, my Lord and my God.
[2578.40 → 2583.10] Then Jesus told him, because you have seen me, you have believed.
[2583.76 → 2586.66] Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.
[2587.68 → 2593.84] Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
[2594.28 → 2599.78] But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
[2600.24 → 2604.00] And that by believing, you may have life in his name.
[2604.86 → 2606.08] This is the word of the Lord.
[2606.08 → 2606.96] Amen.
[2608.40 → 2608.80] Amen.
[2609.60 → 2610.56] Please pray with me.
[2612.50 → 2614.36] Our Father, we thank you for your word.
[2615.22 → 2617.62] We thank you for how clear it is.
[2618.14 → 2620.82] How we are not dealing with words that we cannot understand.
[2621.52 → 2628.16] But that when your Holy Spirit accompanies your word, that we can expect great blessing from above.
[2628.16 → 2633.32] And so we pray for that blessing for each one of us here.
[2633.78 → 2634.78] For Jesus' sake.
[2635.40 → 2635.84] Amen.
[2637.18 → 2640.40] Now I don't know how many of you know of this interview.
[2640.40 → 2645.18] But Steve Jobs, who is the founder of Apple computers.
[2645.18 → 2654.02] He, in an interview, he said that he was 50-50 on belief in God.
[2654.66 → 2657.86] He said he didn't really believe in God.
[2658.20 → 2667.32] But he couldn't get away from the nagging feeling that there was more to life than that he could just see and taste and feel.
[2667.32 → 2674.78] And I think a lot of people today, especially, are right in that same place.
[2675.72 → 2675.84] Right?
[2675.90 → 2683.04] Many people are skeptical about the claims of religion, especially of the Christian faith.
[2683.04 → 2688.26] You know, which is, you know, just that, like, the Bible is the word of God.
[2688.94 → 2691.24] That Jesus came as a person.
[2692.26 → 2695.02] That God came as a person, excuse me, in Jesus.
[2695.52 → 2695.74] Right?
[2695.78 → 2698.04] And that Jesus died and he rose again.
[2698.44 → 2700.90] And that he still lives, even though we can't see him.
[2701.38 → 2703.68] And that he invites us to find our life in him.
[2704.66 → 2704.90] Right?
[2704.96 → 2708.16] Those beliefs seem crazy to most people today.
[2708.16 → 2717.50] And yet, those very same people who are skeptical about religion cannot escape that deep sense in our gut that there is something more.
[2718.10 → 2718.32] Right?
[2718.38 → 2722.28] That there is something beyond this material world that we see.
[2724.72 → 2724.92] Okay?
[2725.06 → 2730.24] Now, but also, this morning, I want to invite us to be honest.
[2730.24 → 2739.92] That actually, even for us who are Christians, we too sometimes struggle to believe.
[2741.06 → 2741.30] Right?
[2741.38 → 2746.16] None of us can escape the fact that it is difficult to believe today.
[2747.12 → 2754.12] So, here's a quote from a philosopher, a philosophy professor named James K.A. Smith.
[2754.66 → 2755.82] So, he writes this.
[2755.82 → 2764.68] Even as faith endures in our secular age, believing doesn't come easy.
[2765.84 → 2767.60] Faith is fraught.
[2768.50 → 2773.50] Confession is haunted by an inescapable sense of its contestability.
[2774.46 → 2774.60] Right?
[2774.62 → 2775.54] It can be contested.
[2775.80 → 2778.30] There's as much evidence for belief as there is for not.
[2779.26 → 2782.20] We don't believe instead of doubting.
[2782.20 → 2785.48] We believe while doubting.
[2786.10 → 2788.36] We're all Thomas now.
[2790.78 → 2795.70] Now, I think what this author is saying is that in this modern secular world that we live in,
[2795.84 → 2797.76] belief and doubt are now intertwined.
[2798.66 → 2804.04] And that it would actually be unrealistic for any of us to expect to be able to believe as a Christian
[2804.04 → 2812.16] and to live as a Christian, and at times not wonder whether some of this or all of this is true.
[2812.16 → 2813.16] Right?
[2813.16 → 2814.16] Right?
[2814.16 → 2819.14] All of us, at some level at least, can relate to Thomas.
[2819.84 → 2820.72] That's the point.
[2821.62 → 2828.80] So, today what I want to do is explore this passage about doubt and belief in the story of Jesus and Thomas.
[2828.80 → 2834.66] Thomas was one of Jesus' closest friends, one of his twelve disciples.
[2835.86 → 2839.62] And Thomas knows for sure that Jesus died on the cross.
[2840.02 → 2841.68] There's no doubt about that.
[2841.68 → 2848.16] But he has also heard that Jesus has miraculously raised back to life.
[2848.84 → 2850.22] But he doesn't believe it.
[2850.90 → 2852.46] It just doesn't seem plausible.
[2853.40 → 2855.48] So he demands evidence.
[2855.48 → 2863.94] And to everyone's surprise, in the story, Jesus comes to Thomas and gives him all the evidence he asked for and even more.
[2864.72 → 2867.84] And Jesus invites Thomas to believe.
[2868.48 → 2873.40] And he invites all of us today to believe and accept this invitation to believe as well.
[2873.98 → 2877.92] So let's look at the story together as it unfolds in two stages.
[2877.92 → 2881.18] And first we're going to see the challenge of belief.
[2881.44 → 2883.86] Then secondly, the invitation to belief.
[2884.86 → 2885.96] Okay, just two points for today.
[2886.26 → 2890.92] So let's begin with the challenge of belief.
[2891.60 → 2894.78] So we're going to pick up in our story again in verse 24.
[2894.78 → 2901.38] Now Thomas, also known as Denims, which means like twin, he has a twin.
[2902.30 → 2906.54] One of the twelve was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
[2907.58 → 2910.14] So the other disciples told them, we have seen the Lord.
[2911.18 → 2920.96] But he said to them, unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side,
[2920.96 → 2926.18] which is kind of strange, I will not believe.
[2928.00 → 2937.04] You know, one of the things right off the bat that I absolutely love about this story is that so often the disciples of Jesus are not these like flat characters.
[2937.50 → 2937.60] Right?
[2937.64 → 2939.34] They have so much personality.
[2939.60 → 2942.58] They are so kind of real and honest and alive.
[2942.58 → 2953.38] And so with Thomas, there's another time in the Gospel of John that actually gives us another glimpse into Thomas' personality.
[2954.00 → 2960.14] So before Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he's going to be crucified and arrested,
[2960.14 → 2967.58] Thomas, in a very kind of pessimistic, mournful kind of way, he says,
[2968.34 → 2972.78] let's all go with Jesus to Jerusalem so that we can die with him.
[2974.16 → 2974.60] Right?
[2974.72 → 2977.76] So Thomas wants to be faithful to Jesus.
[2978.48 → 2983.22] But he also tends to have a kind of fairly bleak outlook on how this is all going to turn out.
[2983.54 → 2986.56] So he says to all the other disciples, let's go with Jesus.
[2986.96 → 2988.10] Let's just all die with him.
[2988.10 → 2994.14] And then on Easter Sunday, when Jesus appears to the other disciples, they see him.
[2994.52 → 2998.90] At that moment, Thomas isn't there.
[2999.44 → 3000.38] Thomas isn't with them.
[3001.36 → 3002.74] We don't know why he's not there.
[3003.00 → 3005.38] Maybe he was out getting coffee for the other disciples.
[3006.60 → 3013.22] Maybe he was kind of an introvert, and he just needed some time away to process everything that was going on.
[3013.22 → 3020.00] But whatever the case, he was not with the other disciples when Jesus came and appeared to them.
[3020.78 → 3024.40] So later, the disciples tell Thomas, we've seen the Lord.
[3025.38 → 3026.98] But Thomas doesn't believe them.
[3026.98 → 3033.26] Now, what we have to realize is that these men and women, these disciples who were gathered, who saw Jesus,
[3034.06 → 3035.80] he trusts them.
[3036.62 → 3036.78] Right?
[3036.94 → 3038.36] He's lived with them.
[3038.44 → 3040.52] They have followed Jesus together.
[3040.96 → 3042.62] He knows them intimately.
[3043.08 → 3045.18] Why would they just make this up?
[3045.68 → 3047.62] It's a crazy thing for them to make up,
[3047.86 → 3049.76] unless it's actually true.
[3049.76 → 3053.78] But Thomas, he hears this and he doesn't believe them.
[3055.36 → 3059.20] And so, he needs some scientific inquiry.
[3060.34 → 3068.20] He won't believe unless he can see and touch the scars of the crucifixion on Jesus' hands inside.
[3069.36 → 3075.70] Okay, now, to be fair, Thomas wasn't with them when Jesus appeared to them.
[3075.70 → 3080.98] So, naturally, he would kind of have what we would call some honest skepticism.
[3082.22 → 3082.38] Right?
[3082.48 → 3086.24] He doesn't have a doubting personality overall.
[3086.66 → 3089.30] He just has some very real, honest questions.
[3090.02 → 3092.18] And he would like some real, honest answers.
[3093.50 → 3096.36] So, I think instead of calling him doubting Thomas,
[3096.84 → 3100.68] we should call him skeptical missing Thomas.
[3101.32 → 3102.94] Doesn't quite roll off the tongue as well.
[3102.94 → 3104.74] But he's not just doubting.
[3104.92 → 3105.88] He's skeptical.
[3106.30 → 3107.28] He wasn't there.
[3108.06 → 3110.38] So, he's struggling with doubt and disbelief.
[3110.80 → 3113.96] But what I want us to see is that it is a healthy struggle.
[3114.52 → 3115.68] It's a healthy kind of doubt.
[3116.66 → 3119.04] What makes Thomas' doubt healthy?
[3120.08 → 3124.14] First, he is genuinely voicing his doubt.
[3124.78 → 3124.98] Right?
[3125.02 → 3126.56] He's putting it out there in the open.
[3126.56 → 3131.86] He's inviting other people to share in that with him.
[3132.94 → 3136.34] And then second, he is actually actively looking for the answer.
[3137.24 → 3137.38] Right?
[3137.44 → 3142.52] He is prepared, and he is willing to believe if there's good reason for it.
[3143.92 → 3147.98] And so, I think rather than like looking at Thomas as this negative character in the Bible,
[3148.20 → 3151.80] where we tell our kids, you don't want to be like doubting Thomas.
[3151.80 → 3159.46] No, actually, I think we can learn from Thomas what a healthy doubt looks like
[3159.46 → 3163.48] and how it is different from an unhealthy kind of doubt and skepticism.
[3164.48 → 3164.58] Okay?
[3164.66 → 3169.86] So, if healthy doubt is, you know, voicing our doubts, making them public,
[3171.00 → 3173.80] doubt that is unhealthy remains silent.
[3174.96 → 3175.48] Right?
[3175.48 → 3179.48] In many of us, in some way or another, we have secret doubts.
[3180.42 → 3182.86] Areas of the Christian faith that we aren't so sure about.
[3183.40 → 3187.38] Questions that we have that have long gone unanswered.
[3188.10 → 3191.78] And for maybe fear of appearing weak in our faith
[3191.78 → 3196.44] or maybe not wanting to seem unintelligent,
[3197.30 → 3198.84] we just bury our doubts.
[3199.84 → 3202.30] But when we do that, these doubts that we've buried,
[3202.40 → 3203.98] they kind of settle into our hearts
[3203.98 → 3206.14] and they're just like this dark cloud.
[3206.94 → 3209.90] And it makes you feel kind of like a fraud or a hypocrite
[3209.90 → 3212.54] because you're acting like you believe all this stuff,
[3212.60 → 3214.70] but secretly inside you know there's something,
[3215.18 → 3217.40] maybe actually there are some things that you don't believe.
[3218.06 → 3219.60] But you keep it to yourself.
[3219.96 → 3221.26] So, it never gets resolved.
[3223.10 → 3225.64] Now, there's another kind of unhealthy doubt.
[3225.64 → 3230.04] And it's, you know, so if Thomas' doubt is actually looking for an answer,
[3230.14 → 3232.36] it's ready to believe, it wants to believe,
[3233.70 → 3238.10] unhealthy doubt is stubborn, entrenched doubt.
[3238.82 → 3239.34] Right?
[3239.40 → 3244.66] It's automatically suspicious of any answers to the Christian faith.
[3245.40 → 3247.66] It's not open to hear any sort of explanation
[3247.66 → 3249.30] simply because it doesn't want to hear it.
[3249.94 → 3253.26] And this is unhealthy because there's no intellectual curiosity.
[3253.62 → 3255.00] There's no desire to know.
[3256.54 → 3258.90] And so, it's worth noting that Thomas just wasn't skeptical
[3258.90 → 3260.26] because he's not spiritual.
[3261.10 → 3261.32] Right?
[3261.36 → 3262.56] That is not true about Thomas.
[3262.86 → 3263.86] He is a good Jew.
[3263.96 → 3265.04] He believes in God.
[3265.74 → 3269.04] As a Jew, he would believe that when Jesus died,
[3269.12 → 3270.98] his spirit would go to be with God.
[3272.42 → 3276.16] It was the real kind of physical resurrection
[3276.16 → 3278.40] that challenged,
[3279.20 → 3281.02] that was a challenge for Thomas to believe
[3281.02 → 3282.76] because it was totally unexpected.
[3282.76 → 3286.56] He had no categories for which to understand this.
[3287.26 → 3289.06] But he voiced his doubts
[3289.06 → 3292.02] and he was willing to believe
[3292.02 → 3294.94] if there was enough evidence.
[3294.94 → 3299.56] So now, let me ask all of us a question.
[3301.28 → 3304.78] Have we made room in our church
[3304.78 → 3307.84] for this kind of healthy doubt?
[3307.84 → 3311.60] Are we helping each other
[3311.60 → 3315.16] or creating space for us
[3315.16 → 3316.94] to give voice
[3316.94 → 3318.92] to our doubts and our questions
[3318.92 → 3320.84] so that we together can
[3320.84 → 3322.62] seek answers?
[3322.62 → 3326.06] Now, here's one way we can do that.
[3326.18 → 3327.38] If someone does come
[3327.38 → 3328.50] and express a doubt
[3328.50 → 3330.70] or a question about the Christian faith,
[3330.78 → 3332.42] you know, maybe it's in a small group setting
[3332.42 → 3335.06] or in a Sunday school classroom
[3335.06 → 3336.48] or at a dinner table,
[3337.52 → 3339.90] what you should not do
[3339.90 → 3341.08] is panic.
[3341.78 → 3343.16] That's what we typically do.
[3343.48 → 3343.70] Ah!
[3344.60 → 3345.16] We panic,
[3345.44 → 3346.34] especially if it's our kids.
[3346.66 → 3347.24] Don't panic.
[3347.24 → 3349.38] What you should do first
[3349.38 → 3351.02] is express gratitude.
[3352.06 → 3352.78] Thank you.
[3353.38 → 3355.62] Thank you for sharing that.
[3356.64 → 3357.64] Because now,
[3358.28 → 3359.40] in a healthy way,
[3359.56 → 3360.90] we can invite one another
[3360.90 → 3363.08] to explore that question
[3363.08 → 3364.80] and to seek an answer
[3364.80 → 3366.78] and to seek faith together.
[3368.40 → 3369.60] And so in Thomas' doubt,
[3369.70 → 3370.40] we first see
[3370.40 → 3372.36] that it has always been a challenge
[3372.36 → 3373.00] to believe
[3373.00 → 3374.18] from the first century
[3374.18 → 3375.18] till today.
[3375.18 → 3377.38] But there is a healthy kind of doubt
[3377.38 → 3378.08] that we can have.
[3378.86 → 3379.40] But now,
[3379.50 → 3380.28] we don't stay there
[3380.28 → 3380.80] in our doubt
[3380.80 → 3383.10] because the next part here
[3383.10 → 3384.98] is an invitation to believe.
[3385.60 → 3387.14] So let's go back to our story
[3387.14 → 3389.80] and see this invitation to believe
[3389.80 → 3391.54] and we'll pick up in verse 26.
[3393.14 → 3393.96] A week later,
[3394.18 → 3396.74] his disciples were in the house again
[3396.74 → 3398.08] and Thomas was with them.
[3398.76 → 3400.16] Though the doors were locked,
[3400.30 → 3402.10] Jesus came and stood among them
[3402.10 → 3402.56] and said,
[3402.90 → 3403.72] Peace be with you.
[3403.72 → 3405.60] Then he said to Thomas,
[3405.98 → 3407.26] Put your finger here.
[3407.58 → 3408.50] See my hands.
[3408.94 → 3409.92] Reach out your hand.
[3410.36 → 3411.40] Put it into my side.
[3411.84 → 3413.72] Stop doubting and believe.
[3415.30 → 3417.04] Okay, so what's going on here is,
[3417.12 → 3417.26] you know,
[3417.30 → 3418.28] it's been a whole week
[3418.28 → 3420.24] after Thomas said
[3420.24 → 3421.14] he would not believe
[3421.14 → 3422.98] unless he could touch the hand
[3422.98 → 3423.92] and the side of Jesus.
[3424.84 → 3426.70] And now the disciples were together
[3426.70 → 3429.14] and Thomas brought back the coffee.
[3429.50 → 3431.24] He's with them this time.
[3431.24 → 3434.80] And though the doors were locked,
[3435.88 → 3438.06] Jesus appears miraculously
[3438.06 → 3439.88] and stood among them
[3439.88 → 3440.56] and said,
[3441.06 → 3442.78] Peace be with you.
[3443.46 → 3444.44] Jesus, I think,
[3444.52 → 3445.58] wanted Thomas to know
[3445.58 → 3446.90] that he comes in peace
[3446.90 → 3448.88] despite Thomas' doubts.
[3450.00 → 3451.02] And what's interesting
[3451.02 → 3453.18] is that Jesus knew
[3453.18 → 3455.00] about his doubting.
[3455.24 → 3455.68] Right?
[3455.76 → 3456.70] We see that in this passage.
[3456.70 → 3459.30] It's clear that Jesus knows
[3459.30 → 3460.92] what Thomas said
[3460.92 → 3462.74] to the other disciples
[3462.74 → 3463.48] the week before.
[3465.24 → 3467.44] And so Jesus suddenly appears
[3467.44 → 3467.98] in the room.
[3468.46 → 3470.26] He walks right up to Thomas
[3470.26 → 3472.26] and before Thomas even has a chance
[3472.26 → 3473.40] to say anything,
[3474.08 → 3474.90] Jesus says,
[3475.48 → 3477.14] Thomas, see my hands.
[3477.50 → 3478.48] Put your finger here.
[3478.88 → 3479.70] Reach out your hand.
[3479.80 → 3480.72] Put it into my side.
[3480.78 → 3481.44] It's me.
[3482.04 → 3483.20] I am here.
[3484.24 → 3486.34] Stop doubting and believe.
[3486.34 → 3490.18] And what I hope we can see
[3490.18 → 3493.36] is how gentle Jesus is
[3493.36 → 3495.58] with Thomas' doubt.
[3496.52 → 3496.74] Right?
[3496.84 → 3498.36] Jesus doesn't walk in the room
[3498.36 → 3500.64] and maybe there's this like
[3500.64 → 3502.46] really tense moment going on
[3502.46 → 3503.48] and he says,
[3503.60 → 3505.00] Thomas, there is no room
[3505.00 → 3508.34] in this group for doubters.
[3508.84 → 3508.96] Right?
[3509.06 → 3509.76] Pack it up.
[3510.00 → 3511.12] Pack up your skepticism
[3511.12 → 3512.04] and get out.
[3513.04 → 3514.32] Jesus doesn't say that.
[3514.32 → 3517.54] He meets Thomas in his doubt
[3517.54 → 3519.22] because he loves him.
[3520.76 → 3523.30] Jesus loves his skeptical,
[3524.14 → 3525.54] slow-to-believe friend
[3525.54 → 3527.94] and so he invites him
[3527.94 → 3529.36] to believe,
[3529.52 → 3531.22] to go beyond his doubt
[3531.22 → 3533.34] and into belief.
[3533.78 → 3533.92] Right?
[3533.96 → 3534.98] He loves him too much
[3534.98 → 3536.10] to let him remain
[3536.10 → 3536.90] in his doubts.
[3536.90 → 3539.22] And so Thomas then
[3539.22 → 3540.38] has a chance to respond.
[3540.96 → 3541.84] And in verse 28,
[3542.42 → 3544.00] Thomas breaks out
[3544.00 → 3546.20] in praise and worship.
[3546.68 → 3547.52] Thomas said to him,
[3547.96 → 3548.72] my Lord
[3548.72 → 3550.12] and my God.
[3552.24 → 3552.56] Right?
[3552.68 → 3554.90] And no one would dream
[3554.90 → 3556.54] as a first century Jew
[3556.54 → 3558.32] of saying to any man
[3558.32 → 3559.12] in the flesh,
[3559.50 → 3560.38] my God,
[3561.02 → 3562.22] unless they believe
[3562.22 → 3562.74] that person
[3562.74 → 3564.46] to truly be God.
[3564.46 → 3566.68] and that is now
[3566.68 → 3567.46] what Thomas
[3567.46 → 3569.62] precisely believes.
[3571.02 → 3573.30] Jesus is the risen Lord.
[3574.70 → 3575.10] And you know,
[3575.16 → 3575.88] and then you can kind of
[3575.88 → 3576.92] maybe imagine Jesus
[3576.92 → 3578.08] kind of putting his hand
[3578.08 → 3579.46] on Thomas' shoulder
[3579.46 → 3581.20] and in this kind of
[3581.20 → 3582.08] very kind
[3582.08 → 3583.78] but firm way
[3583.78 → 3585.04] giving him
[3585.04 → 3586.76] the gentlest of chides
[3586.76 → 3588.36] where he says this
[3588.36 → 3589.08] in verse 29,
[3590.08 → 3591.08] then Jesus told him,
[3591.60 → 3592.72] because you have seen me,
[3592.72 → 3593.92] you have believed.
[3594.70 → 3595.60] Blessed are those
[3595.60 → 3596.64] who have not seen me
[3596.64 → 3598.92] and yet have believed.
[3600.36 → 3601.02] And I think here
[3601.02 → 3601.74] Thomas isn't,
[3601.92 → 3603.12] Jesus isn't so much
[3603.12 → 3604.28] rebuking Thomas
[3604.28 → 3606.84] as he is encouraging us.
[3607.60 → 3607.74] Right?
[3607.82 → 3608.56] Encouraging us
[3608.56 → 3610.08] who would come later.
[3611.26 → 3611.50] Right?
[3611.56 → 3612.02] You and I,
[3612.12 → 3613.08] we haven't seen
[3613.08 → 3614.18] Jesus face to face.
[3614.40 → 3615.36] We haven't been there.
[3615.46 → 3616.00] We weren't there
[3616.00 → 3616.72] when he appeared.
[3617.74 → 3619.32] We haven't put our fingers
[3619.32 → 3620.92] into the nail marks
[3620.92 → 3621.72] in his hands.
[3621.72 → 3623.38] We haven't put our hands
[3623.38 → 3624.04] into the wounds
[3624.04 → 3624.70] of his side.
[3625.94 → 3627.58] And if that was required
[3627.58 → 3629.82] for belief for us today,
[3629.82 → 3631.52] the church would have died out
[3631.52 → 3632.30] right after Jesus
[3632.30 → 3633.22] ascended into heaven.
[3633.28 → 3633.44] Right?
[3633.60 → 3635.16] We would not be gathered here.
[3636.36 → 3638.52] So Jesus is inviting us
[3638.52 → 3639.34] to believe
[3639.34 → 3641.06] even though we haven't
[3641.06 → 3642.08] seen him.
[3642.50 → 3643.48] Even though we couldn't
[3643.48 → 3644.60] demand this evidence
[3644.60 → 3645.40] like Thomas did.
[3646.66 → 3648.06] But even though you and I
[3648.06 → 3648.90] don't get to demand
[3648.90 → 3649.90] this physical evidence
[3649.90 → 3650.68] from Jesus
[3650.68 → 3651.74] the way Thomas did,
[3652.06 → 3652.94] that doesn't mean
[3652.94 → 3653.84] he has left us
[3653.84 → 3654.62] without any sort
[3654.62 → 3655.44] of evidence at all.
[3656.02 → 3656.22] Right?
[3656.30 → 3658.08] The tomb is empty.
[3659.16 → 3660.38] The body of Jesus
[3660.38 → 3661.62] was never found.
[3662.46 → 3663.14] But in fact,
[3663.22 → 3663.84] there were hundreds
[3663.84 → 3664.36] and hundreds
[3664.36 → 3665.42] of eyewitnesses
[3665.42 → 3666.60] who saw him
[3666.60 → 3667.70] after his resurrection.
[3668.12 → 3668.88] Then the church
[3668.88 → 3670.08] grew and expanded
[3670.08 → 3671.52] against all historical
[3671.52 → 3672.78] probability and odds.
[3673.24 → 3674.48] And most of the disciples
[3674.48 → 3675.92] were willing to die
[3675.92 → 3678.04] rather than to deny
[3678.04 → 3679.18] that they saw Jesus
[3679.18 → 3679.84] in the flesh.
[3681.12 → 3681.26] Right?
[3681.30 → 3682.16] So there is abundant
[3682.16 → 3683.86] evidence for the resurrection
[3683.86 → 3684.34] of Jesus
[3684.34 → 3685.38] more than we need.
[3686.80 → 3687.62] But of course,
[3687.72 → 3687.84] you know,
[3687.90 → 3688.60] for most of us
[3688.60 → 3689.44] that is not the way
[3689.44 → 3690.54] that belief works anyway.
[3692.60 → 3693.10] And you know,
[3693.16 → 3693.90] I think Jesus
[3693.90 → 3696.24] did not rebuke Thomas
[3696.24 → 3698.16] for not correctly
[3698.16 → 3699.26] weighing the evidence
[3699.26 → 3699.84] and drawing
[3699.84 → 3700.68] the right conclusion.
[3701.40 → 3702.38] That's not why
[3702.38 → 3703.34] Jesus rebukes him.
[3704.20 → 3705.08] He rebukes him
[3705.08 → 3706.08] for not trusting him.
[3706.98 → 3707.20] Right?
[3707.26 → 3708.20] For not taking him
[3708.20 → 3709.28] at his word
[3709.28 → 3710.26] the first time.
[3712.34 → 3712.70] Excuse me.
[3716.34 → 3717.76] And so this invitation
[3717.76 → 3718.90] to believe
[3718.90 → 3720.54] is really
[3720.54 → 3721.34] an invitation
[3721.34 → 3723.12] to trust Jesus.
[3723.98 → 3724.94] To take him
[3724.94 → 3725.52] at his word
[3725.52 → 3727.36] for who he said he is.
[3727.78 → 3729.06] He is the risen Lord.
[3730.56 → 3731.50] And the evidence
[3731.50 → 3732.08] is there
[3732.08 → 3733.06] to encourage us.
[3733.24 → 3733.72] It's there
[3733.72 → 3735.10] to support our belief.
[3735.74 → 3736.36] But it's not
[3736.36 → 3737.96] that we build
[3737.96 → 3738.98] our belief
[3738.98 → 3739.90] on the evidence.
[3740.84 → 3741.68] We believe
[3741.68 → 3743.10] because Jesus
[3743.10 → 3744.04] has met us
[3744.04 → 3744.64] in our doubts
[3744.64 → 3747.04] and he has invited us
[3747.04 → 3748.20] to trust in him.
[3749.12 → 3750.54] And then he grants us
[3750.54 → 3751.12] the faith
[3751.12 → 3751.78] to believe.
[3753.32 → 3754.30] And so let's summarize
[3754.30 → 3755.30] before we conclude.
[3756.30 → 3757.68] In this secular age
[3757.68 → 3758.38] that we live in,
[3758.84 → 3759.80] we don't believe
[3759.80 → 3760.76] instead of doubting
[3760.76 → 3761.76] like it's one or the other.
[3761.76 → 3763.28] We believe
[3763.28 → 3764.48] while doubting.
[3764.62 → 3765.04] We believe
[3765.04 → 3765.66] while engaging
[3765.66 → 3766.84] in some of the doubts
[3766.84 → 3767.46] that we have.
[3767.78 → 3768.52] In a sense,
[3768.62 → 3769.64] we're all Thomas now.
[3770.54 → 3771.32] And in the midst
[3771.32 → 3772.38] of our challenges
[3772.38 → 3773.46] and our questions
[3773.46 → 3774.22] and our doubts,
[3774.60 → 3775.22] you and I
[3775.22 → 3775.94] are invited
[3775.94 → 3776.90] to believe.
[3778.60 → 3778.84] You know,
[3778.94 → 3779.86] and the thing is,
[3779.96 → 3780.60] Jesus is not
[3780.60 → 3781.34] intimidated
[3781.34 → 3782.92] or offended
[3782.92 → 3784.14] by our doubts.
[3785.14 → 3786.28] But with gentleness,
[3786.28 → 3787.32] he meets us
[3787.32 → 3787.92] in our doubts.
[3788.40 → 3789.36] And he invites us
[3789.36 → 3789.82] to believe
[3789.82 → 3790.48] and to trust
[3790.48 → 3790.78] in him
[3790.78 → 3791.48] that he is
[3791.48 → 3792.70] the resurrected Lord.
[3793.24 → 3794.18] And by believing
[3794.18 → 3794.62] in him,
[3794.66 → 3795.28] we are invited
[3795.28 → 3796.08] to find life
[3796.08 → 3796.48] in him.
[3797.86 → 3799.06] And then to illustrate
[3799.06 → 3800.78] this invitation
[3800.78 → 3801.60] to belief,
[3802.04 → 3802.90] I want us to look
[3802.90 → 3803.60] at this painting
[3803.60 → 3805.90] by the Italian painter
[3805.90 → 3807.02] Caravaggio.
[3809.02 → 3810.06] It's pretty faint.
[3810.16 → 3810.38] I don't know
[3810.38 → 3810.72] if we can,
[3811.04 → 3811.56] yeah, thanks.
[3813.14 → 3814.30] So there's Jesus.
[3815.14 → 3815.94] There's Thomas,
[3816.20 → 3816.34] right?
[3816.38 → 3816.90] He's the one
[3816.90 → 3817.44] looking right
[3817.44 → 3818.14] at Jesus there.
[3818.76 → 3819.22] And then there's
[3819.22 → 3820.34] these two other disciples.
[3821.02 → 3822.08] They're all bent over.
[3822.20 → 3822.84] They're all looking
[3822.84 → 3823.82] at Jesus' wounds.
[3825.38 → 3826.36] And even Jesus
[3826.36 → 3827.90] is leaning over,
[3828.04 → 3828.60] looking into
[3828.60 → 3829.34] his own wounds,
[3829.50 → 3831.08] and with his own hand,
[3831.18 → 3832.76] he's taking Thomas' hand
[3832.76 → 3834.34] and he's pulling it
[3834.34 → 3835.46] into his side.
[3836.82 → 3837.80] And when we look
[3837.80 → 3838.76] at the expression
[3838.76 → 3839.82] on Jesus' face,
[3839.90 → 3840.34] it's not one
[3840.34 → 3841.18] of annoyance
[3841.18 → 3842.62] or condemnation
[3842.62 → 3843.22] or judgment,
[3843.72 → 3844.58] but it's a look
[3844.58 → 3845.72] of incredible intimacy.
[3846.90 → 3848.06] It's a look
[3848.06 → 3848.84] of invitation.
[3849.58 → 3850.54] Like, Thomas,
[3850.66 → 3851.56] you can, yes,
[3851.76 → 3852.84] you can touch me here.
[3854.04 → 3854.80] And these other
[3854.80 → 3855.54] two disciples
[3855.54 → 3856.34] looking on,
[3856.44 → 3857.22] who now represent
[3857.22 → 3858.06] all of us,
[3858.78 → 3859.78] we're looking on
[3859.78 → 3860.54] and we're following
[3860.54 → 3861.62] Thomas' fingers
[3861.62 → 3862.78] going into
[3862.78 → 3863.24] the wounds
[3863.24 → 3863.70] of Jesus.
[3864.50 → 3865.48] And all of us
[3865.48 → 3866.00] through them
[3866.00 → 3866.82] are being drawn
[3866.82 → 3868.28] into Jesus' wounds.
[3869.56 → 3870.90] And what he's saying
[3870.90 → 3871.72] at this moment
[3871.72 → 3873.12] is, Thomas,
[3873.22 → 3874.32] I heard your questions.
[3874.32 → 3876.60] I know your doubts.
[3877.34 → 3877.96] And the answer
[3877.96 → 3878.54] is yes.
[3879.26 → 3880.16] You can trust me.
[3880.28 → 3880.58] Yes,
[3881.30 → 3882.30] you can touch me.
[3883.08 → 3884.04] Do not believe.
[3884.44 → 3885.04] Do not doubt.
[3885.70 → 3886.54] But believe.
[3887.48 → 3888.16] And in believing,
[3888.36 → 3888.84] find life.
[3890.10 → 3890.40] And friends,
[3890.48 → 3891.18] this is what Jesus
[3891.18 → 3891.78] would say
[3891.78 → 3892.88] to you today.
[3894.50 → 3895.10] Jesus Christ
[3895.10 → 3896.36] is risen from the dead
[3896.36 → 3897.72] and by his
[3897.72 → 3899.00] resurrection presence,
[3899.22 → 3900.54] he comes to you
[3900.54 → 3901.92] in your questions
[3901.92 → 3902.72] and your doubts
[3902.72 → 3904.66] and he invites you
[3904.66 → 3907.14] to believe in him
[3907.14 → 3908.48] and to find life
[3908.48 → 3909.14] in his name.
[3910.36 → 3911.54] So let's pray together.
[3913.94 → 3914.78] Heavenly Father,
[3914.94 → 3915.58] we confess
[3915.58 → 3916.90] that our hearts
[3916.90 → 3917.84] are not
[3917.84 → 3920.26] 100%
[3920.26 → 3922.36] pure in belief.
[3922.56 → 3923.24] But so often
[3923.24 → 3923.98] there's a mixture
[3923.98 → 3925.14] of belief
[3925.14 → 3925.66] and doubt
[3925.66 → 3926.24] of faith
[3926.24 → 3927.08] and skepticism
[3927.08 → 3929.58] of questions.
[3929.58 → 3931.60] and we confess
[3931.60 → 3932.60] to you this morning
[3932.60 → 3933.36] that we want
[3933.36 → 3934.06] to believe
[3934.06 → 3934.86] like Thomas,
[3935.54 → 3936.26] even in the midst
[3936.26 → 3936.90] of our doubts.
[3937.98 → 3939.12] And so we ask Jesus
[3939.12 → 3940.22] that you would help us
[3940.22 → 3940.74] to believe
[3940.74 → 3941.48] that you are
[3941.48 → 3942.52] who you said you are.
[3942.62 → 3943.70] You are the Son of God,
[3943.78 → 3944.48] the risen Lord.
[3945.52 → 3946.40] And that by believing
[3946.40 → 3947.84] we can find life in you.
[3949.34 → 3950.22] Would you come
[3950.22 → 3951.88], and would you give us life?
[3952.58 → 3954.10] We pray in your name.
[3954.60 → 3954.90] Amen.
[3954.90 → 3958.20] So let's all stand.
[3958.30 → 3958.70] We'll sing
[3958.70 → 3959.98] our Song of Response.
[3965.42 → 3966.56] This is a new song
[3966.56 → 3966.98] for us.
[3967.02 → 3967.86] I'll play it through
[3967.86 → 3969.38] so you can get familiar
[3969.38 → 3971.20] with the melody line
[3971.20 → 3972.36] and then we'll sing it together.
[3972.36 → 3976.16] processing
[3976.16 → 3978.16] Amen.
[4006.16 → 4008.54] Together.
[4036.16 → 4038.16] Together.
[4066.16 → 4067.42] I am found.
[4067.82 → 4069.74] All in you.
[4070.14 → 4072.86] Oh Lord I am found.
[4074.90 → 4078.14] The words of Psalm 139.
[4081.66 → 4087.72] Though darkness covers my hope and sight.
[4087.72 → 4092.72] And night overtakes my troubled mind.
[4092.72 → 4098.98] In darkness you my daylight will shine.
[4099.30 → 4102.72] In you oh Lord I am found.
[4103.92 → 4108.72] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4108.72 → 4123.92] Before my birth you composed my frame.
[4123.92 → 4128.92] You gazed in my eyes and you my name.
[4129.92 → 4135.14] You wrote with love each part of my days.
[4135.40 → 4138.92] In you oh Lord I am found.
[4139.92 → 4144.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4144.92 → 4151.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4151.92 → 4154.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4154.92 → 4157.92] Where can I run from my love.
[4157.92 → 4161.92] So deep so boundless and strong.
[4161.92 → 4162.92] So deep.
[4162.92 → 4164.92] So deep.
[4164.92 → 4166.92] No height nor depth.
[4166.92 → 4168.92] Can separate me.
[4168.92 → 4172.92] In you oh Lord I am found.
[4172.92 → 4173.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4173.92 → 4174.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4174.92 → 4179.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4179.92 → 4180.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4180.92 → 4181.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4181.92 → 4186.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4186.92 → 4192.92] All in you oh Lord I am found.
[4192.92 → 4197.92] Amen.
[4197.92 → 4198.92] You may be seated.
[4198.92 → 4205.92] All in you oh Lord.
[4205.92 → 4211.92] Our offering this morning is for Servants Anonymous.
[4211.92 → 4213.92] It's the SA Foundation.
[4213.92 → 4220.92] And as it says there they do ministry to amongst women, sometimes men and children escaping
[4220.92 → 4222.92] from human trafficking.
[4222.92 → 4228.92] And so could I ask the deacons to come forward to collect our offering this morning.
[4228.92 → 4229.92] From education.
[4229.92 → 4232.92] How can I help me in search of an opportunity when I hold my offering this morning?
[4232.92 → 4233.92] Come out.
[4233.92 → 4235.92] Come out.
[4236.92 → 4238.92] Come out.
[4243.92 → 4248.92] I studied this morning.
[4248.92 → 4249.92] Amen.
[4278.92 → 4280.92] Amen.
[4308.92 → 4310.92] Amen.
[4338.92 → 4340.92] Amen.
[4360.56 → 4367.16] So today we have a very special guest with us, and we have an opportunity to hear an a
[4367.16 → 4372.06] missions update, an update from a missionary and our special missionary today, and I don't know if
[4372.06 → 4378.32] she would use that term, but we'll let her tell us about it, is Hannah Vanderkamp. I think many of
[4378.32 → 4383.94] you know her, and I just met her this week, and so I'm going to invite her up to share with us.
[4384.36 → 4388.78] After she shares, we'll see a little bit of a video about her ministry, and then we'll pray.
[4397.16 → 4410.58] There it is. Okay, the camp. Let me move that down here. Good morning. It's very good to be here.
[4410.58 → 4419.56] Unexpectedly, I didn't expect to be back so soon after my summer visit. The last time I stood up
[4419.56 → 4430.46] here was when I did my confession of faith in 1986 with Reverend Solomon, and I can just remember
[4430.46 → 4437.94] those years, and all my friends, and many of your faces are still here today. That's good.
[4437.94 → 4454.80] My work, I try to fulfill what the Lord said in Psalm 146, verse 9. The Lord takes care of those who
[4454.80 → 4465.20] are in a strange land. I've been living on the island of Lesbos for about 20 years with my family,
[4465.20 → 4470.30] raised a family there. Some of the kids are already off the island, some are still there,
[4470.30 → 4482.84] and I've been working with refugees probably since 2012, first voluntarily, and then working with
[4482.84 → 4490.68] organizations that came to the island, and then again voluntarily. Some of you supported me when
[4490.68 → 4501.00] we opened a day centre in 2016 when we had the heavy flow of refugees to our island, and I must say,
[4501.00 → 4509.44] let me see where am I, and so again, I thank you for all those who are here who did support me in that.
[4509.44 → 4521.14] Up until about 2022, I was working, the last NGO that I worked with, this means a humanitarian organization, was Caritas,
[4521.14 → 4529.00] which is actually a faith-based organization, and I was working with them in their women's safe space,
[4529.00 → 4543.00] and of course always teaching English since that's what I'm trained to do, teaching English to adults. However, due to the ongoing crisis in many parts of the world,
[4543.00 → 4557.00] Ukraine, Sudan, Israel, Caritas has run out of money, and so I had to start thinking about where I could get the funding to continue my work.
[4557.00 → 4567.00] Well, I was here last summer, and I was talking to Marianne Tendril, because we always connect and talk about what's going on, and she said,
[4567.00 → 4575.00] why don't you try out, what was the other organization? Yeah, World Renew. So we checked them out, and they said,
[4575.00 → 4590.00] maybe you should go and ask Resonate Global Mission, and they passed me along to Steve Van Zane, who heads the European team for Resonate,
[4590.00 → 4599.00] Resonate, and he said, oh yes, we'll set you up, where have you been all these years? And it was very nice, I felt like I was coming home,
[4599.00 → 4613.00] after all those years of working with foreign, sometimes secular organizations, it was a real blessing to connect with a CRC person, and to go to a Resonate retreat,
[4613.00 → 4622.00] retreat, which I did just recently, and to meet all these CRC people living in Europe and serving in Europe, we had a very good time together.
[4622.00 → 4629.00] I felt like I was back with my own tribe of people.
[4629.00 → 4641.00] So, I am here because I need to find the financial supporters to continue my work. I'm here for two months, and this is one of my prayers,
[4641.00 → 4652.00] is that I will trust the Lord to provide what I need, and He will guide me to say the right words, and to meet the right people.
[4652.00 → 4664.00] So, let me tell you about this camp that you see on the screen here. This is called the Macro-Vuni Camp. It's the second camp that was built on this island,
[4664.00 → 4673.00] the first camp, which was a horrible, horrible, awful camp, not prepared for what happened there. It burned down.
[4673.00 → 4682.00] And this camp replaced it in another location. In this camp, which is run by the Greek government,
[4682.00 → 4692.00] and, you know, in the Greek, in the camp we have a UN, United Nations human rights officials there, and organizations,
[4692.00 → 4703.00] and then many non-governmental organizations helping to care for the people living there, there are, at the moment, 3,500 people in this camp.
[4703.00 → 4715.00] 70% of the people there are from Afghanistan. As you can imagine, it is not a country where people can live, particularly women.
[4715.00 → 4724.00] You cannot live there. You can't go to school. You have no hope. So, I'm always so happy to see the Afghan women in our camp,
[4724.00 → 4733.00] being free to do what they want to do. We have Syrians. We have Eritreans from Sierra Leone, Palestinians.
[4733.00 → 4740.00] A lot of Palestinians were showing up in my class just before the war started in Israel.
[4740.00 → 4751.00] Last year, I had only Sudanese men in my class, and suddenly, that shifted to a lot of Afghans once again.
[4751.00 → 4762.00] So, the ebb and the flow of the members or the people that come to my class are reflected by the conflict that is going on in the Mideast and in Africa.
[4762.00 → 4771.00] The island itself is at its closest point to Turkey, only 12 kilometres away.
[4771.00 → 4777.00] So, 12 kilometres, people get in their boats, and they're going to try to make that crossing.
[4777.00 → 4782.00] This week, we had 61 arrivals. This past week, 61 arrivals came.
[4782.00 → 4795.00] And you will see at a video later just exactly how many have come since about 2015. It's incredibly high numbers.
[4795.00 → 4809.00] Now, for my work, teaching in the camp, very often, I'm probably one of the first Christian contacts that they might have on a regular basis,
[4809.00 → 4813.00] because they'll come into the classroom three or four times a week.
[4813.00 → 4822.00] So, it's a real privilege for me to engage with them, to joke with them, to be female-teaching the men,
[4822.00 → 4833.00] to have the men and the women sitting together, and to start talking a little bit about, you know, the different ways that we might live in Europe,
[4833.00 → 4842.00] and to make them feel that they are in a safe place. It's a place where they can learn.
[4842.00 → 4855.00] Some people have never, ever gone into a classroom before. And so, for me, this is a real opportunity for some intense learning.
[4855.00 → 4862.00] Hopefully, I can get them to be literate by the time they leave. This does take some skill.
[4862.00 → 4871.00] It took me a long time to learn how to teach these people. I had to learn a little bit of Farsi. My French always comes in handy.
[4871.00 → 4878.00] Nope, I didn't pick up any Arabic because I find Arabic so difficult.
[4878.00 → 4890.00] Once people have gone through these classes, or part of the point of these classes is that they will have increased employability once they leave the class.
[4890.00 → 4895.00] If you know some English, and the other person next to you doesn't, who is the employer going to pick?
[4895.00 → 4902.00] It's going to pick the person who knows some English. I tell them that you have to start. If you haven't started, you have to start right now.
[4902.00 → 4909.00] You have to live in Europe, and you will have to supply, you know, you will have to care for your families.
[4909.00 → 4917.00] So, this is a big hurdle that comes to them once they're here. It also helps with their integration into society.
[4917.00 → 4927.00] It's an important part of speaking to your neighbours, speaking to the people that you interact with on a daily, in your daily routines.
[4927.00 → 4936.00] The other thing is that reduces vulnerability. So, if you can read and write, there's less chance that somebody's going to take advantage of you.
[4936.00 → 4946.00] And, when you flee from a foreign country, when you flee from your own country, and you go to another country, you haven't had time to prepare. You've fled.
[4946.00 → 4956.00] You're very vulnerable to people who might take advantage of you. And so, it's incredibly important for us to provide them with the skills that would reduce that possibility.
[4956.00 → 4972.00] I also work with, not I also work, I work with an organization called Euro Relief. This is a Greek Christian organization that is inside the camp.
[4972.00 → 4988.00] So, Resonate has made an agreement with Euro Relief. And, I work with Euro Relief. And, Resonate is my sending organization.
[4988.00 → 5005.00] They, it's one of the largest organizations in the camp. It's been steady witness and a steady help to the Greek authorities who have been trying to, to help these people as they come across for years.
[5005.00 → 5018.00] And, I have Dutch groups, young, young groups of Dutch people coming from Holland. So, when they see my last name, they're like, what, what, what are you doing here? What, who are you? Are you Dutch? What are you?
[5018.00 → 5030.00] And, I have to explain the story, you know. Well, my parents are Dutch, but I come from Canada, but I live in Greece, and I can't. It's, it gets a little complicated, but it's so fun to meet these young people.
[5030.00 → 5051.00] We also have Amish Mennonites now joining us as well. It was, it was a huge culture shock when one day in 2015, I went to the supermarket, and out of the supermarket came this woman wearing this long skirt, and a little head covering right here at the back of her head.
[5051.00 → 5058.00] And, I looked at her, and I looked at her, and I went, how, what? How did they get here? I thought this was the edge of the world.
[5058.00 → 5064.00] Well, they, they're still there, and they're an incredible part of our team, and I love spending time with them.
[5064.00 → 5077.00] And, it's just part of the blessing of having all these people that have come to volunteer in the camp from so many places around the world, so many Christians from so many countries.
[5077.00 → 5089.00] And, these people have been caring for the people there with such incredible warmth and kindness that many have come to Christ.
[5089.00 → 5100.00] Many Afghans have come to Christ. Many people have come to Christ. Volunteers who volunteered with Euro Relief, you don't have to be a Christian to volunteer with them.
[5100.00 → 5110.00] But, so some of these volunteers are not, but after spending time with the volunteers who are Christian, many of them have become Christian.
[5110.00 → 5121.00] Because you, you, it's, it's the deed, it's how we act. It's the love and the compassion that we live with on a daily basis that is going to change hearts.
[5121.00 → 5127.00] And so, I'm really privileged to be able to work with Euro Relief.
[5127.00 → 5142.00] Volunteering is something that we will also be pursuing with Resonate. So, keep your ears open, and your hearts open.
[5142.00 → 5156.00] If any of you are looking for something interesting to do, you have some free time, you can always come to Greece, and join us, and work for at least three months.
[5156.00 → 5162.00] We've got, not three months, three months is your maximum if you're coming from outside the European Union.
[5162.00 → 5177.00] So, we are setting all of that up as we speak. I have one man from Austria right now is covering my classes while I am gone, and he's 70 years old. Yes?
[5177.00 → 5186.00] So, we have people from 18 all the way up until whoever feels fit and fine is very welcome.
[5186.00 → 5196.00] Let me tell you the story about Majid. Majid was one of my students a little while back. Majid was born in Afghanistan.
[5196.00 → 5207.00] He told us that when he was born, his mother rejected him, even before he was born, for various family circumstances.
[5207.00 → 5215.00] And she would push him away, and she pushed him out onto the streets, and from a very, very young age, he had to try to fend for himself,
[5215.00 → 5230.00] without the love of his mother, a very basic part of our lives. He survived, you know, with violence. He was tormented, because he had no one to love him.
[5230.00 → 5248.00] He came, he got married, he had kids. The torment was very real inside his family as well. And he came to the camp. He crossed the sea and came to the camp.
[5248.00 → 5266.00] And he met Christ through the volunteers with Error Relief and became a Christian. And for the very first time, he had a father. And he had the love and the acceptance, and a way to forgive all the pain that he had experienced in his life.
[5266.00 → 5276.00] And he came to my class. He was barely literate. He could barely read. So we worked on all the phonics that he needed to do. And we developed his vocabulary.
[5276.00 → 5294.00] And he would come into class and say, you're my sister. He couldn't say, you're my sister in Christ, because there's, in the camp, you're, you're, you feel a little bit circumscribed by, you know, the, the, the feelings in the class.
[5294.00 → 5301.00] For example, if you have a lot of Muslims, maybe you don't want to say that necessarily in front of them. I don't have a problem saying that.
[5301.00 → 5312.00] But maybe somebody in the camp will not want to say that out loud, because they might be bullied into behaving a certain way.
[5312.00 → 5320.00] Or if their wives take off their hijab, maybe this is, can also be a, a problem in that community, inside the camp.
[5320.00 → 5330.00] You can imagine what kind of culture that can be sometimes. So, Majid, he had, he won the lucky golden ticket.
[5330.00 → 5339.00] Apparently, one of the people, volunteers in the camp, really decided that this man needed something good to happen in his life.
[5339.00 → 5347.00] And he, he, he sponsored him to leave the camp. And he's now in Northern Alberta. I think he's in North Battle ford.
[5347.00 → 5354.00] And he's living there with his family and his kids are going to school. I mean, this is, this usually does not happen.
[5354.00 → 5362.00] Once refugees come across, and they're in Europe, they stay in, inside Europe. They're not supposed to make this trip and pop over to Canada.
[5362.00 → 5370.00] But that was such a wonderful story from Majid. I'm so thankful that his life has turned completely around.
[5370.00 → 5377.00] What you are going to see, we're going to see a little video of one of my students, other, another student of mine.
[5377.00 → 5394.00] He's still in the camp as we speak. His name is Khaled. He's from Syria. And, um, um, you can, you can remember that while he's speaking, he, he was working for approximately $18 a month.
[5394.00 → 5408.00] That's all he was getting paid. Can't survive on that. And, um, he paid probably $10,000 to get from Syria to the island. Yes.
[5408.00 → 5422.00] Because he had to pay off so many people, um, as he was moving over the different borders that, that people have made and that other people, you know, have territory, and they claim that you'll have to pay the money.
[5422.00 → 5431.00] So that is, um, wait a minute. That's Khaled. Yes. So I'm going to sit down. So please enjoy the video.
[5431.00 → 5440.00] Um, I will be standing at the back of the church after and, uh, I have some more photos set up if you'd like to check that out.
[5440.00 → 5449.00] And also I have a brochure if you would like to come and get one from me. And any questions that I could answer, um, I will try to do my best.
[5449.00 → 5452.00] Thank you very much.
[5452.00 → 5475.00] Thank you very much.
[5475.00 → 5476.00] Thank you very much.
[5476.00 → 5478.00] Everybody has a journey.
[5478.00 → 5502.00] My name is Khan Barak at, and I am from Syria. I work in a Syrian petroleum company as a geophysicologist. A nice day it was. But it doesn't, uh, continuous, stupid after war.
[5502.00 → 5519.00] I have four, uh, four, uh, four children, uh, boys, two, uh, two, uh, two, uh, two, uh, two boys. Uh, our school, uh, uh, destroyed because army used it for, uh, war.
[5519.00 → 5527.00] Anyone want to leave Syria or another country. It's, uh, a, uh, a journey of death.
[5527.00 → 5541.00] Uh, put me in a small room with, uh, 20 people. With, for two days without, uh, toilet, without a drink, without, uh, anything.
[5541.00 → 5555.00] We stay today, uh, uh, in me. We can't sleep. The boat has moved, uh, rapidly. Moved rapidly.
[5555.00 → 5571.00] We stay on the shore must, uh, uh, follow the boat, uh, or jet boat, uh, swimming.
[5571.00 → 5576.00] Swimming. Swimming. Swimming. Who, uh, and it was winter. So cold.
[5579.00 → 5588.00] We spend all night waiting, uh, after, uh, arriving to the, uh, Greek, uh, shore.
[5588.00 → 5593.00] We wait for morning to come, uh, your incoming and, uh, save us.
[5593.00 → 5608.00] Save us. Give us, uh, like, uh, food, water. And, uh, if you want to learn, it's, uh, there is a small school help you.
[5608.00 → 5618.00] I feel I am not under pressure. I am free. I haven't a dream.
[5618.00 → 5635.00] Because my dream is finished. I, my dream is to, uh, for my boys, my girls, to bring it and to take a good learning and, uh, a good health and medical health.
[5635.00 → 5648.00] And, uh, uh, a good situation. It's my country and my native country. I, it's my dream to go back.
[5650.00 → 5657.00] And then, there. But I can't. It's not safe for me and for my family.
[5657.00 → 5663.00] My journey is not over.
[5664.00 → 5668.00] God has a plan for me and my family.
[5668.00 → 5697.98] Thank you.
[5698.00 → 5700.00] Thank you.
[5704.24 → 5709.18] Well, thank you, Hannah, so much for sharing about what you do, for teaching us.
[5710.04 → 5723.26] And so as Hannah mentioned, and I'll reiterate, I want to invite us as a church to really carefully consider how we can pray for Hannah and how we can financially support her ministry.
[5723.26 → 5727.20] And she will be, as she said, right in the fellowship hall where we'll be having coffee.
[5727.34 → 5730.58] She's got a table and some more photos, brochures.
[5730.70 → 5731.86] We learn more about her ministry.
[5732.06 → 5736.78] I encourage you to go and talk to her and hear more about what she's doing.
[5737.34 → 5738.64] So let's pray for Hannah.
[5739.02 → 5741.78] And please join me in prayer.
[5741.78 → 5749.64] Our Heavenly Father, we, Lord, thank you for the calling that you have put on Hannah's life.
[5751.06 → 5756.28] And, Lord, we thank you that you have brought her to that place, Lesbos Island in Greece.
[5756.28 → 5762.42] And, Lord, that you have put her there to be a blessing to many of the refugees who come through.
[5763.36 → 5769.90] And, Lord, when we see such a large problem, Lord, we might think, what can we possibly do?
[5770.74 → 5772.82] But, Lord, we thank you that you are at work.
[5773.30 → 5779.26] You are at work through all kinds of different people who you gather together to do the work that you have called them to do.
[5779.26 → 5788.42] And, Lord, we pray that as a church that we might be able to support Hannah in our prayers and our giving so that we could also be a part of this and join her in what she's doing.
[5788.88 → 5795.04] Lord, help her as she spends these two months here in North America sharing with other churches and raising her support.
[5795.20 → 5804.46] Lord, would you provide all that she needs so that she could return home and continue to work with Resonate as a new partner with her.
[5804.46 → 5811.70] And, Lord, we thank you again this morning for welcoming us, teaching us, feeding us in this time of worship.
[5812.60 → 5819.34] Lord, we deserve nothing from you, but in your great mercy you have given us everything, in your Son, Jesus Christ.
[5820.76 → 5825.74] Lord, we receive your love, and we love you in return.
[5826.02 → 5829.30] We give ourselves to believe in you and to follow you.
[5829.94 → 5833.48] And, Lord, grant us you're blessing, we ask in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[5834.08 → 5834.34] Amen.
[5835.44 → 5840.62] Let's stand, and we'll receive the Lord's blessing as we get ready to leave.
[5843.98 → 5845.68] I invite you to hold out your hands.
[5846.06 → 5847.44] It's a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5848.16 → 5850.90] Do not fear, for I have redeemed you.
[5851.54 → 5853.28] I have summoned you by name.
[5853.38 → 5854.06] You are mine.
[5854.74 → 5857.64] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
[5858.28 → 5861.44] When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[5861.98 → 5864.32] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned.
[5864.46 → 5867.96] For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour.
