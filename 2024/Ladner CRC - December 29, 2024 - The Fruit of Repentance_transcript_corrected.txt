[336.18 → 346.18] Good morning to you all.
[346.18 → 351.18] Welcome to our Gathered Worship Service at Landon Christian Reformed Church.
[351.74 → 353.02] My name is Jason True.
[353.16 → 358.44] I'm the lead pastor here, and it is my delight to welcome you to worship this morning.
[358.54 → 360.88] I'm really glad that you have joined us today.
[361.52 → 368.30] Today is a very special day because we will be having a baptism later, and we'll learn
[368.30 → 370.84] more about that later on in the service.
[371.66 → 379.60] For now, I'd also like to call our attention to someone in our congregation, Jerry Iron,
[379.60 → 384.78] who will be celebrating his 99th birthday on Friday.
[385.94 → 392.84] And so, yeah, that is definitely something to celebrate, and so we'll pray for the Lord's
[392.84 → 396.42] continued hand upon him as he's, you know, 99.
[397.06 → 402.18] And I believe he hopes to make it to 100, so that's his hope.
[402.18 → 410.32] Another announcement is that on Thursday, January 1st, we will be having our New Year's
[410.32 → 411.26] Day worship service.
[411.74 → 418.82] So right here, 10 o'clock, first day of the year, we gather before the Lord to seek his
[418.82 → 421.28] blessing and his guidance for the new year.
[421.28 → 431.52] Also, in your bulletins is a bookmark, and this is a series of Bible readings that you
[431.52 → 438.18] can use to read daily for your own devotions, and, so please do take note of that.
[439.12 → 443.36] And so let's prepare our hearts this morning to worship together, and we'll begin with a
[443.36 → 446.40] call to worship from Psalm 28.
[446.98 → 448.76] And we'll see this responsibly.
[448.96 → 449.48] I'll begin.
[449.48 → 455.70] Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.
[456.48 → 459.18] The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[459.42 → 459.74] Together.
[460.66 → 464.22] My heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
[464.86 → 469.66] My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.
[470.28 → 478.06] The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
[478.06 → 481.86] Save your people and bless your inheritance.
[482.76 → 486.18] Be our shepherd and carry us forever.
[487.38 → 489.00] Let's turn our hearts in prayer.
[489.62 → 492.92] Would you please join me in prayer as we worship our Lord?
[494.00 → 498.16] O Lord, our God, we come together this morning as your people.
[498.16 → 501.84] Your mercies are new to us every morning.
[501.84 → 507.36] And so also new are our songs of praise to you today.
[507.36 → 515.80] Lord, we thank you that you call us your people, and so we lift our hearts up to you in praise and in trust.
[515.80 → 521.82] For you are our help, you are our joy, our shepherd, our fortress.
[521.82 → 526.92] We praise you as we remember in this Christmas season that you came to be with us.
[527.76 → 528.94] You humbled yourself.
[529.18 → 535.60] You entered into our world to be our rescuer, to be our king and our saviour.
[536.06 → 538.76] And we ask that you would be with us this morning as well.
[539.24 → 542.96] Be with us as your people gathered to worship you.
[543.22 → 549.98] Be with each one of us individually that we might receive your blessing through Jesus Christ.
[549.98 → 553.68] We pray in his name and for his sake. Amen.
[554.88 → 560.58] Let's stand, and we'll hear God's greeting to us this morning from Isaiah 52.
[562.24 → 564.42] The Lord has comforted his people.
[564.88 → 566.58] He has redeemed Jerusalem.
[567.50 → 572.26] And all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
[573.02 → 575.52] Brothers and sisters, the peace of the Lord be with you.
[575.80 → 577.20] And also with you.
[577.20 → 580.36] Let's turn and let's greet one another in that peace.
[580.36 → 580.42] Let's turn.
[580.42 → 581.20] Let's turn.
[581.20 → 584.38] Let's greet one another in that peace.
[584.92 → 588.38] Let's meet the Senhor, let's talk about a.
[588.52 → 589.48] Let's hear God's friend.
[589.48 → 589.64] Let's join.
[589.68 → 590.26] Let's meet the Lord.
[590.26 → 592.04] We pray.
[593.30 → 594.20] To those who shall "...
[594.20 → 594.36] Let's work...
[594.36 → 597.70] Let's go."
[598.24 → 604.96] After you see the next morning, it seems to be the following.
[605.82 → 606.10] Let's do so much.
[606.10 → 606.32] Let's pray.
[608.52 → 610.14] You love God's hand, let's feel for the Lord.
[610.14 → 611.32] 사람들이 man, unfortunately.
[611.32 → 612.36] I will not get.
[612.60 → 613.50] You love him.
[613.50 → 643.48] Thank you.
[643.50 → 649.68] Jesus, the light of the world.
[651.30 → 657.50] Glory to the newborn King.
[658.30 → 662.50] Jesus, the light of the world.
[663.58 → 670.80] We'll walk in the light, beautiful light.
[670.80 → 677.60] Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[677.84 → 684.80] All shine around us by day and by night.
[685.96 → 690.80] Jesus, the light of the world.
[690.80 → 698.80] Christ, thy highest heaven, Lord.
[699.84 → 704.80] Jesus, the light of the world.
[704.80 → 712.80] Christ, the everlasting Lord.
[713.84 → 717.80] Jesus, the light of the world.
[719.26 → 727.10] We'll walk in the light, beautiful light.
[727.10 → 733.02] Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[733.98 → 734.72] Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[734.72 → 748.72] shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world
[756.08 → 760.72] Jesus the light of the world
[764.72 → 778.72] the sun of righteousness Jesus the light of the world
[784.32 → 792.72] where the dew drops of mercy shine
[794.72 → 808.72] all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world

[1982.72 → 2012.70] Thank you.
[2012.72 → 2042.70] Thank you.
[2042.72 → 2072.70] Thank you.
[2072.70 → 2102.68] Thank you.
[2102.68 → 2132.66] Thank you.
[2132.66 → 2162.64] Thank you.
[2162.66 → 2192.64] Thank you.
[2192.66 → 2222.64] Thank you.
[2222.64 → 2252.62] Thank you.
[2252.62 → 2282.60] Thank you.
[2282.60 → 2312.58] you healthcare's car,
[2312.60 → 2319.08] and does it stay that way? Maybe for like 11 seconds, right? But then it kind of just gets
[2319.08 → 2324.88] messy again. You don't even know how it happens. And our hearts can be the same way. You know,
[2324.92 → 2329.78] confession is not just something that we do once, and it's one and done, and it stays that way.
[2330.46 → 2337.68] Our hearts get messy again. And so again, this morning, we ask God to do that cleaning work in
[2337.68 → 2345.06] our hearts, to write all the things that have kind of been turned over sideways. And so together,
[2345.24 → 2351.14] let's open our hearts before God. Let us turn away from sin and let us turn to Christ. Would you join
[2351.14 → 2360.06] me in a prayer of confession? Heavenly Father, all year long, we confess that we pursue power
[2360.06 → 2369.26] and privilege, yet you come in weakness. All year long, we struggle with longing for
[2369.26 → 2378.20] and coveting material things when you alone offer what is lasting. O Lord, in Jesus Christ,
[2378.30 → 2385.82] you have given us a kingdom that cannot be destroyed. Forgive us our sins, open our eyes to your truth,
[2385.82 → 2392.82] strengthen us to do your will, and give us the joy of the salvation that is ours in Christ Jesus,
[2393.02 → 2402.28] our Lord. We pray. Amen. So now let's take comfort from these words from the Apostle Paul. And we
[2402.28 → 2407.06] didn't plan this, but I actually chose the same passage that Jeremy read earlier from Romans 6.
[2407.06 → 2415.46] We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised
[2415.46 → 2421.90] from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united
[2421.90 → 2430.40] with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
[2431.02 → 2436.72] Friends, the good news of the gospel is that in Jesus Christ, we are forgiven. Thanks be to God.
[2437.06 → 2439.80] So let's sing our next song, our song of response.
[2439.80 → 2441.80] One child born in the stillness.
[2441.80 → 2455.98] One child born in the stillness.
[2455.98 → 2460.28] Shines with her promise, Emmanuel.
[2460.28 → 2466.80] One child born in the stillness.
[2466.80 → 2471.44] Living within us, Emmanuel
[2471.44 → 2478.46] We're singing glory, glory
[2478.46 → 2484.02] Let there be peace, let there be peace
[2484.02 → 2489.14] Singing glory, glory
[2489.14 → 2495.46] Let there be peace, let it start in me
[2496.80 → 2501.26] One voice speaks for the voiceless
[2501.26 → 2505.88] All for the hopeless, Emmanuel
[2505.88 → 2512.08] One love brings us together
[2512.08 → 2516.86] Now and forever, Emmanuel
[2516.86 → 2523.56] We're singing glory, glory
[2523.56 → 2529.02] Let there be peace, let there be peace
[2529.02 → 2534.52] Sing in glory, glory
[2534.52 → 2541.02] Let there be peace, let it start in me
[2541.02 → 2545.48] Do not be afraid
[2545.48 → 2553.64] His love is strong enough to save us
[2553.64 → 2557.22] Nothing stands in the way
[2557.22 → 2563.94] His love is strong enough to lead us
[2563.94 → 2569.40] Do not be afraid
[2569.40 → 2575.74] His love is strong enough to save us
[2575.74 → 2579.40] Nothing stands in the way
[2579.40 → 2586.80] His love is strong enough to lead us
[2586.80 → 2592.26] Sing in glory, glory
[2592.26 → 2598.68] Let there be peace, let there be peace
[2598.68 → 2603.26] Sing in glory, glory
[2603.26 → 2609.64] Let there be peace, let it start in me
[2609.64 → 2615.10] Let there be peace, let it start in me
[2615.10 → 2634.06] All right, the kids are invited to go to their Sunday school classes
[2634.06 → 2646.04] So today we are continuing actually in our sermon series
[2646.04 → 2650.04] That we started in Advent called Preparing the Way
[2650.04 → 2654.62] We've been considering the life and the ministry of John the Baptist
[2654.62 → 2661.48] Who is really the significant figure that we meet in the opening chapters of all four Gospels
[2661.48 → 2666.54] And whose role was to prepare the way for the coming Messiah
[2666.54 → 2673.40] And we've been reflecting on how we can prepare the way for the Lord
[2673.40 → 2677.12] Right, how we can prepare His way to come into our own lives
[2677.12 → 2679.08] And into our own hearts
[2679.08 → 2682.14] And even though Advent is over
[2682.14 → 2685.00] I wanted to actually take a couple more weeks
[2685.00 → 2687.66] Actually this week and then the next two weeks
[2687.66 → 2690.14] To continue to look at John the Baptist
[2690.14 → 2691.94] Because there's more written about Him
[2691.94 → 2694.54] In the Gospel of Luke that we can learn from
[2694.54 → 2697.92] And, so please turn with me in your Bibles
[2697.92 → 2700.00] If you will, to Luke chapter 3
[2700.00 → 2704.04] We will have the scripture on the screen as well
[2704.04 → 2708.68] But I think it's good to have your Bibles open
[2708.68 → 2711.82] You can make sure I didn't fudge the words or anything
[2711.82 → 2713.00] Okay
[2713.00 → 2714.86] So John 3
[2714.86 → 2718.70] And in your bulletin it says 7 to 20
[2718.70 → 2722.24] I cited that as more than I could chew
[2722.24 → 2723.14] Or so to speak
[2723.14 → 2725.94] So we're actually just going to read 7 through 14 today
[2725.94 → 2731.32] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's Word
[2731.32 → 2733.92] John said to the crowds
[2733.92 → 2736.12] Coming out to be baptized by Him
[2736.12 → 2739.06] You brood of vipers
[2739.06 → 2742.38] Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath
[2742.38 → 2745.50] Produce fruit in keeping with repentance
[2745.50 → 2748.00] And do not begin to say to yourselves
[2748.00 → 2749.82] We have Abraham as our father
[2749.82 → 2752.52] For I tell you that out of these stones
[2752.52 → 2754.26] God can raise up children for Abraham
[2754.26 → 2757.06] The axe is already at the root of the trees
[2757.06 → 2759.66] And every tree that does not produce good fruit
[2759.66 → 2761.76] Will be cut down and thrown into the fire
[2761.76 → 2763.72] What should we do then?
[2763.86 → 2764.64] The crowd asked
[2764.64 → 2765.82] John answered
[2765.82 → 2769.52] The man with two tunics should share with him who has none
[2769.52 → 2772.88] And the one who has food should do the same
[2772.88 → 2776.28] Tax collectors also came to be baptized
[2776.28 → 2777.78] Teacher, they asked
[2777.78 → 2779.24] What should we do?
[2779.98 → 2782.18] Don't collect any more than you are required
[2782.18 → 2782.86] He told them
[2782.86 → 2785.24] Then some soldiers asked him
[2785.24 → 2786.70] And what should we do?
[2787.34 → 2788.02] He replied
[2788.02 → 2789.14] Don't extort money
[2789.14 → 2790.94] And don't accuse people falsely
[2790.94 → 2792.28] Be content with your pay
[2792.28 → 2794.98] This is the word of the Lord
[2794.98 → 2799.36] So let's pray for God's blessing
[2799.36 → 2802.22] Upon the reading and the preaching of His word this morning
[2802.22 → 2802.64] Let's pray
[2802.64 → 2806.26] Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your word
[2806.26 → 2810.62] And as we read, and we ponder Your word this morning
[2810.62 → 2813.68] Would You help our ears to be open
[2813.68 → 2815.90] Our hearts to be open
[2815.90 → 2818.82] May we experience, and may we know
[2818.82 → 2820.66] All that You have for us
[2820.66 → 2823.14] May You transform us more and more
[2823.14 → 2825.28] Into the image of Your Son today
[2825.28 → 2827.08] In Christ's name we pray
[2827.08 → 2827.74] Amen
[2827.74 → 2830.66] Now when John began
[2830.66 → 2832.32] His public ministry
[2832.32 → 2834.40] He had a message to proclaim
[2834.40 → 2835.90] To the people of God
[2835.90 → 2837.08] He had a message
[2837.08 → 2839.54] He had it for the Israelites
[2839.54 → 2840.28] God's people
[2840.28 → 2842.22] To prepare them
[2842.22 → 2843.58] For the coming of the Messiah
[2843.58 → 2845.42] And it was a message
[2845.42 → 2846.82] Of repentance
[2846.82 → 2850.88] How you prepare the way for the Lord
[2850.88 → 2853.10] Is through repentance
[2853.10 → 2855.92] And we'll talk about what that means as we go
[2855.92 → 2857.80] And so here's our outline
[2857.80 → 2859.44] As we look at this passage today
[2859.44 → 2861.28] We're going to look at John's manner
[2861.28 → 2863.12] His mission
[2863.12 → 2865.36] And then at his message
[2865.36 → 2867.10] Particularly the message of repentance
[2867.10 → 2868.96] Okay, so if you like to take notes
[2868.96 → 2870.16] Or want to know where we're headed
[2870.16 → 2871.62] We're going to look at John's manner
[2871.62 → 2872.84] His mission
[2872.84 → 2874.20] And his message
[2874.20 → 2876.50] So first
[2876.50 → 2879.60] We'll look at the manner of John
[2879.60 → 2880.80] Now you know
[2880.80 → 2882.46] One of the ways that we evaluate
[2882.46 → 2885.26] Whether we like a doctor
[2885.26 → 2888.82] Is by their bedside manner
[2888.82 → 2890.66] So you know
[2890.66 → 2893.30] Do they show real concern for you?
[2894.30 → 2897.02] Does it seem like they really care?
[2897.58 → 2898.86] Does it seem like they know what they're doing?
[2898.86 → 2900.48] But also do they really care?
[2901.86 → 2903.14] Are they gentle?
[2903.52 → 2905.50] But also are they honest
[2905.50 → 2906.90] About your health?
[2908.48 → 2909.94] Well let's see what we think about
[2909.94 → 2911.82] John's bedside manner
[2911.82 → 2912.44] So to speak
[2912.44 → 2913.48] You know
[2913.48 → 2915.68] And so we've had quite a build up
[2915.68 → 2917.22] To John so far
[2917.22 → 2917.50] Right?
[2917.56 → 2918.78] Even before chapter 3
[2918.78 → 2919.84] We've heard about
[2919.84 → 2921.48] The prophecy of his birth
[2921.48 → 2921.74] Right?
[2921.80 → 2922.90] When the angel Gabriel
[2922.90 → 2925.54] Came to John's father Zechariah
[2925.54 → 2926.16] In the temple
[2926.16 → 2927.76] And told him
[2927.76 → 2929.40] This pretty crazy prophecy
[2929.40 → 2931.28] About his life
[2931.28 → 2934.34] What he would do
[2934.34 → 2935.80] As the one
[2935.80 → 2937.16] To prepare the way for the Lord
[2937.16 → 2939.22] And how he would bring back
[2939.22 → 2940.86] Many of the people of Israel
[2940.86 → 2942.76] To the Lord their God
[2942.76 → 2945.40] And as chapter 3 opens
[2945.40 → 2946.74] We get the sense
[2946.74 → 2948.10] That something is building
[2948.10 → 2949.02] Right?
[2949.10 → 2950.00] After centuries
[2950.00 → 2952.22] Of waiting for God to speak
[2952.22 → 2955.22] After generations of silence
[2955.22 → 2956.92] And anticipation
[2956.92 → 2958.40] And frustration
[2958.40 → 2960.66] We have a lost child
[2960.66 → 2965.04] Luke tells us
[2965.04 → 2966.36] After all of this waiting
[2966.36 → 2969.98] That the word of the Lord
[2969.98 → 2972.14] Came to John
[2972.14 → 2973.30] In the wilderness
[2973.30 → 2975.20] I know you guys
[2975.20 → 2975.98] Aren't listening to me anymore
[2975.98 → 2978.88] Okay
[2978.88 → 2982.46] The people of God
[2982.46 → 2983.94] Were waiting for hundreds of years
[2983.94 → 2985.14] God hadn't spoken
[2985.14 → 2985.84] But finally
[2985.84 → 2987.02] The word of God
[2987.02 → 2987.44] It says
[2987.44 → 2988.76] Came to John
[2988.76 → 2989.74] In the wilderness
[2989.74 → 2992.14] He is the one
[2992.14 → 2993.54] Who was written about
[2993.54 → 2994.94] In the prophet Isaiah
[2994.94 → 2996.08] So long ago
[2996.08 → 2997.04] The voice
[2997.04 → 2998.20] Calling in the wilderness
[2998.20 → 2999.54] To prepare the way of the Lord
[2999.54 → 3001.40] And so this is
[3001.40 → 3002.18] An exciting moment
[3002.18 → 3004.58] This is a glorious moment
[3004.58 → 3006.90] There's been this great build up
[3006.90 → 3009.90] The drum rolls are rolling
[3009.90 → 3012.86] And what's the first thing you hear
[3012.86 → 3014.12] From John?
[3014.82 → 3017.86] You brood of vipers
[3017.86 → 3020.22] Wait, what?
[3021.78 → 3022.28] You know, like
[3022.28 → 3023.46] Excuse me, John
[3023.46 → 3024.46] No, sorry
[3024.46 → 3026.04] Could you say that again?
[3027.02 → 3028.74] I've just come a long way
[3028.74 → 3029.62] To hear you speak
[3029.62 → 3030.98] The word of the Lord
[3030.98 → 3033.12] I just don't think
[3033.12 → 3034.70] I maybe heard you correctly
[3034.70 → 3036.56] Verse 7
[3036.56 → 3038.20] John said to the crowds
[3038.20 → 3040.58] Coming out to be baptized by him
[3040.58 → 3042.80] You brood of vipers
[3042.80 → 3044.02] Who warned you
[3044.02 → 3045.56] To flee from the coming wrath
[3045.56 → 3047.70] Oh
[3047.70 → 3049.66] That is what you said
[3049.66 → 3053.92] Maybe John's manner
[3053.92 → 3055.80] Leaves something to be desired
[3055.80 → 3058.34] But he is a prophet
[3058.34 → 3059.22] After all
[3059.22 → 3060.80] Gabriel said
[3060.80 → 3061.60] He will go on
[3061.60 → 3062.50] Before the Lord
[3062.50 → 3063.74] In the spirit
[3063.74 → 3064.88] And in the power
[3064.88 → 3065.96] Of Elijah
[3065.96 → 3067.36] John
[3067.36 → 3068.62] The prophet
[3068.62 → 3070.12] The last
[3070.12 → 3070.96] In the long line
[3070.96 → 3071.44] Of prophets
[3071.44 → 3072.26] Who would say
[3072.26 → 3074.14] Hard things to Israel
[3074.14 → 3075.74] Because hard things
[3075.74 → 3076.64] Needed to be said
[3076.64 → 3078.34] You know
[3078.34 → 3078.86] The people
[3078.86 → 3079.88] Needed to prepare
[3079.88 → 3080.46] The way
[3080.46 → 3081.92] For the coming king
[3081.92 → 3083.12] For the coming of their Messiah
[3083.12 → 3084.44] And their hearts
[3084.44 → 3085.18] And their lives
[3085.18 → 3086.88] Were not yet ready
[3086.88 → 3089.78] I've heard
[3089.78 → 3091.50] Another pastor
[3091.50 → 3092.32] Describe
[3092.32 → 3093.44] John's manner
[3093.44 → 3094.68] Like this
[3094.68 → 3095.64] As kind of like
[3095.64 → 3096.86] Being sandpaper
[3096.86 → 3098.86] So instead of coming
[3098.86 → 3099.46] As it were
[3099.46 → 3100.66] With a pot of paint
[3100.66 → 3101.82] To paint over
[3101.82 → 3102.66] All the cracks
[3102.66 → 3103.46] In their lives
[3103.46 → 3104.40] To kind of just
[3104.40 → 3105.48] Cover up
[3105.48 → 3106.30] You know
[3106.30 → 3107.20] Realtor special
[3107.20 → 3108.08] Kind of deal
[3108.08 → 3109.36] Cover up all the cracks
[3109.36 → 3111.70] And of their failures
[3111.70 → 3112.62] And their fears
[3112.62 → 3114.00] Instead
[3114.00 → 3116.22] John comes
[3116.22 → 3117.02] With sandpaper
[3117.02 → 3117.42] And it's not
[3117.42 → 3118.68] That fine sandpaper
[3118.68 → 3118.96] You know
[3118.96 → 3119.84] The finishing touches
[3119.84 → 3120.58] Kind of sandpaper
[3120.58 → 3123.04] It's the rough sandpaper
[3123.04 → 3124.64] That a painter
[3124.64 → 3125.96] Uses
[3125.96 → 3127.02] Tell me if I'm wrong
[3127.02 → 3129.02] To
[3129.02 → 3130.34] To prepare
[3130.34 → 3131.26] The surface
[3131.26 → 3132.24] Right
[3132.24 → 3132.94] You need to prepare
[3132.94 → 3133.58] The surface
[3133.58 → 3134.96] If you want
[3134.96 → 3135.60] The paint
[3135.60 → 3137.20] To adhere
[3137.20 → 3137.92] And to stick
[3137.92 → 3138.66] Yeah
[3138.66 → 3139.64] Okay
[3139.64 → 3142.08] And this is what
[3142.08 → 3142.76] John the Baptist
[3142.76 → 3143.38] Was doing
[3143.38 → 3144.88] He's coming with
[3144.88 → 3145.76] Sandpaper
[3145.76 → 3146.72] On the surface
[3146.72 → 3147.38] Of the hearts
[3147.38 → 3148.30] Of his listeners
[3148.30 → 3149.68] By telling them
[3149.68 → 3150.76] What they need to hear
[3150.76 → 3152.08] So that
[3152.08 → 3152.92] The good news
[3152.92 → 3153.96] Of his message
[3153.96 → 3154.90] Of the gospel
[3154.90 → 3156.14] Will stick
[3156.14 → 3157.74] And it will adhere
[3157.74 → 3158.84] And it will connect
[3158.84 → 3159.78] With their lives
[3159.78 → 3161.70] John the prophet
[3161.70 → 3163.46] John the sandpaper
[3163.46 → 3165.62] Preparing the surface
[3165.62 → 3167.04] Even though
[3167.04 → 3168.36] It's harsh
[3168.36 → 3168.96] Even though
[3168.96 → 3169.94] It's abrasive
[3169.94 → 3171.84] Preparing the way
[3171.84 → 3172.50] For the Lord
[3172.50 → 3172.98] In the hearts
[3172.98 → 3173.50] Of the people
[3173.50 → 3176.04] So I wonder
[3176.04 → 3178.68] When you
[3178.68 → 3181.08] Read in the Bible
[3181.08 → 3181.54] Something
[3181.54 → 3182.72] That kind of
[3182.72 → 3183.24] Grates
[3183.24 → 3184.26] Against you
[3184.26 → 3185.40] Maybe grates
[3185.40 → 3186.94] Against your sensibilities
[3186.94 → 3188.92] Where you go
[3188.92 → 3190.36] Wow
[3190.36 → 3191.16] I wouldn't have
[3191.16 → 3191.94] Said it like that
[3191.94 → 3194.44] What do you do?
[3194.44 → 3196.70] And I guess
[3196.70 → 3197.12] We have a couple
[3197.12 → 3197.58] Options
[3197.58 → 3198.86] One is we can
[3198.86 → 3199.88] Kind of brush it
[3199.88 → 3200.52] Under the rug
[3200.52 → 3201.92] Kind of ignore it
[3201.92 → 3203.24] So you think to yourself
[3203.24 → 3203.82] Well you know
[3203.82 → 3204.82] That sounds kind of harsh
[3204.82 → 3205.76] And really
[3205.76 → 3206.92] When I opened my Bible
[3206.92 → 3207.28] Today
[3207.28 → 3208.80] I wanted some comfort
[3208.80 → 3211.10] So that doesn't
[3211.10 → 3212.10] Really do it for me
[3212.10 → 3212.92] I'm just going to
[3212.92 → 3213.38] Ignore it
[3213.38 → 3214.36] And kind of move on
[3214.36 → 3215.26] And find something
[3215.26 → 3215.78] More friendly
[3215.78 → 3217.52] Something more comforting
[3217.52 → 3220.06] Another thing we can do
[3220.06 → 3220.76] Is kind of
[3220.76 → 3222.06] Take a pen
[3222.06 → 3223.18] And cross it out
[3223.18 → 3224.40] Right
[3224.40 → 3225.36] Just say
[3225.36 → 3226.00] You know
[3226.00 → 3228.14] God can't be like that
[3228.14 → 3229.24] Because that goes
[3229.24 → 3229.94] Against the values
[3229.94 → 3230.74] Of my culture
[3230.74 → 3233.18] Or I'm not like that
[3233.18 → 3234.48] My friends are not like that
[3234.48 → 3235.64] So surely God
[3235.64 → 3237.12] Can't be like that
[3237.12 → 3237.56] Either
[3237.56 → 3240.62] Now both options
[3240.62 → 3242.52] Seem to be preferable
[3242.52 → 3243.52] To actually dealing
[3243.52 → 3244.98] With the sandpaper
[3244.98 → 3246.76] That we find in the Bible
[3246.76 → 3248.38] In allowing it
[3248.38 → 3249.96] To do its work
[3249.96 → 3250.92] On us
[3250.92 → 3252.46] But friends
[3252.46 → 3253.62] If we take
[3253.62 → 3254.78] One of those options
[3254.78 → 3256.60] We may soon realize
[3256.60 → 3257.08] That God
[3257.08 → 3257.80] As a kind of
[3257.80 → 3258.72] Genie in a bottle
[3258.72 → 3259.44] Who's just there
[3259.44 → 3260.26] To do my bidding
[3260.26 → 3261.20] To agree with me
[3261.20 → 3262.66] Or God
[3262.66 → 3263.74] As just a cosmic
[3263.74 → 3265.10] Version of myself
[3265.10 → 3266.26] It doesn't have
[3266.26 → 3267.64] The power to change lives
[3267.64 → 3269.26] It doesn't have
[3269.26 → 3270.80] Much to say to us
[3270.80 → 3271.76] To a world
[3271.76 → 3273.00] Of sin
[3273.00 → 3274.16] That needs redemption
[3274.16 → 3276.36] And so what are we
[3276.36 → 3277.04] Supposed to do
[3277.04 → 3278.20] When God says things
[3278.20 → 3279.24] That don't fit
[3279.24 → 3281.52] In with our framework
[3281.52 → 3283.90] Well there's
[3283.90 → 3285.50] Many answers to that
[3285.50 → 3286.68] But one way
[3286.68 → 3288.18] We can start
[3288.18 → 3289.10] An answer
[3289.10 → 3290.08] Would be
[3290.08 → 3290.96] To say this
[3290.96 → 3292.24] To be honest with God
[3292.24 → 3293.70] To say to God
[3293.70 → 3296.04] This is kind of
[3296.04 → 3296.70] Sandpapery
[3296.70 → 3297.48] This is harsh
[3297.48 → 3299.40] This isn't how
[3299.40 → 3300.24] I would do it
[3300.24 → 3300.74] It's not what
[3300.74 → 3301.48] I would say
[3301.48 → 3301.90] It's not how
[3301.90 → 3302.74] I would live
[3302.74 → 3303.38] In fact
[3303.38 → 3303.90] This is quite
[3303.90 → 3304.88] Offensive to me
[3304.88 → 3306.44] In my time and place
[3306.44 → 3307.58] But Lord
[3307.58 → 3308.48] What am I missing?
[3309.48 → 3311.06] What is maybe
[3311.06 → 3312.16] Out of kilter
[3312.16 → 3313.40] In my own perspective?
[3314.10 → 3314.92] What assumptions
[3314.92 → 3316.02] Am I bringing
[3316.02 → 3317.36] That maybe say
[3317.36 → 3319.18] More about me
[3319.18 → 3320.78] And my hopes
[3320.78 → 3321.62] And my fears
[3321.62 → 3322.44] And my values
[3322.44 → 3323.08] Than it actually
[3323.08 → 3323.76] Does say about
[3323.76 → 3324.96] Who you really are
[3324.96 → 3326.48] What you value
[3326.48 → 3329.18] Lord would you help me
[3329.18 → 3330.14] To connect
[3330.14 → 3331.16] With who you are
[3331.16 → 3333.14] Not who I wish
[3333.14 → 3333.82] You would be
[3333.82 → 3335.20] Maybe in my image
[3335.20 → 3336.52] You know
[3336.52 → 3337.66] And if I'm honest
[3337.66 → 3338.32] We're talking about
[3338.32 → 3339.32] Honesty before God
[3339.32 → 3340.84] I can't even really
[3340.84 → 3342.38] Shape who I want
[3342.38 → 3343.34] To be most of the time
[3343.34 → 3344.38] Never mind
[3344.38 → 3345.20] Have the wisdom
[3345.20 → 3346.52] To tell you
[3346.52 → 3347.52] Who you ought to be
[3347.52 → 3349.20] So Lord
[3349.20 → 3349.96] Would you help?
[3350.78 → 3351.54] That's how we can
[3351.54 → 3352.14] Approach these
[3352.14 → 3353.34] Kind of harder
[3353.34 → 3355.36] You brood of vipers
[3355.36 → 3356.00] Kind of
[3356.00 → 3356.40] You know
[3356.40 → 3357.24] Messages we find
[3357.24 → 3358.08] In the Bible
[3358.08 → 3359.38] That's a good place
[3359.38 → 3359.82] To start
[3359.82 → 3360.76] And it's one way
[3360.76 → 3361.54] That we today
[3361.54 → 3362.28] Can also
[3362.28 → 3363.92] Prepare the way
[3363.92 → 3364.54] For the Lord
[3364.54 → 3365.92] To do that work
[3365.92 → 3366.74] Prepare the way
[3366.74 → 3367.32] For the Lord
[3367.32 → 3368.86] To meet us
[3368.86 → 3370.28] In our own hearts
[3370.28 → 3372.88] So you see
[3372.88 → 3373.90] The manner of John
[3373.90 → 3374.94] Is like sandpaper
[3374.94 → 3376.18] It's abrasive
[3376.18 → 3377.96] But that's connected
[3377.96 → 3378.84] To his mission
[3378.84 → 3380.80] That's our second point
[3380.80 → 3381.34] This morning
[3381.34 → 3382.40] The mission of John
[3382.40 → 3382.70] You see
[3382.70 → 3384.30] John is that voice
[3384.30 → 3385.42] Calling out in the wilderness
[3385.42 → 3385.98] Prepare the way
[3385.98 → 3386.80] Of the Lord
[3386.80 → 3389.38] As verse 6 says
[3389.38 → 3390.56] So that all people
[3390.56 → 3391.90] Will see the salvation
[3391.90 → 3392.58] Of God
[3392.58 → 3393.72] Right
[3393.72 → 3395.08] The saving
[3395.08 → 3395.96] Rescue
[3395.96 → 3397.78] Of God
[3397.78 → 3400.34] Salvation
[3400.34 → 3401.90] Rescue
[3401.90 → 3403.78] Why?
[3404.20 → 3404.74] You know
[3404.74 → 3406.00] What do we need
[3406.00 → 3407.24] To be saved from?
[3407.42 → 3408.02] What do we need
[3408.02 → 3409.58] To be rescued from?
[3411.28 → 3411.50] What
[3411.50 → 3412.24] You know
[3412.24 → 3412.92] When they say
[3412.92 → 3414.00] Jesus is my saviour
[3414.00 → 3414.96] Well that means
[3414.96 → 3417.26] That you were in danger
[3417.26 → 3417.54] Right?
[3417.60 → 3418.22] That you had
[3418.22 → 3419.12] To be saved
[3419.12 → 3421.08] Well
[3421.08 → 3421.90] He tells us
[3421.90 → 3422.24] What we need
[3422.24 → 3422.94] To be rescued from
[3422.94 → 3423.56] In verse 7
[3423.56 → 3425.34] We need to be
[3425.34 → 3426.26] Saved from
[3426.26 → 3427.20] As it says there
[3427.20 → 3427.72] At the end
[3427.72 → 3429.14] The coming wrath
[3429.14 → 3430.88] The coming wrath
[3430.88 → 3433.72] Who warned you
[3433.72 → 3434.58] To flee
[3434.58 → 3436.44] From the coming wrath
[3436.44 → 3437.26] Now
[3437.26 → 3438.44] God's wrath
[3438.44 → 3439.46] We have to talk about
[3439.46 → 3440.02] This a bit
[3440.02 → 3442.18] And we have a bit
[3442.18 → 3442.68] In Romans
[3442.68 → 3443.32] As we've been going
[3443.32 → 3443.82] Through the first
[3443.82 → 3444.86] Couple chapters of Romans
[3444.86 → 3445.40] But again
[3445.40 → 3446.82] It's his settled
[3446.82 → 3447.54] Judgment
[3447.54 → 3448.34] Against
[3448.34 → 3449.02] Wrong
[3449.02 → 3449.96] And evil
[3449.96 → 3451.06] In his
[3451.06 → 3451.84] Good and beautiful
[3451.84 → 3452.82] And wonderful world
[3452.82 → 3454.96] And we need rescue
[3454.96 → 3456.72] Because we participate
[3456.72 → 3457.66] In that evil
[3457.66 → 3459.50] We have done
[3459.50 → 3460.12] Evil
[3460.12 → 3460.82] Right?
[3460.90 → 3461.64] We have sinned
[3461.64 → 3462.38] We have rebelled
[3462.38 → 3463.16] Against God
[3463.16 → 3464.46] In his ways
[3464.46 → 3466.10] In such a way
[3466.10 → 3466.98] That has broken
[3466.98 → 3468.16] Our relationship
[3468.16 → 3468.86] With God
[3468.86 → 3469.70] Ourselves
[3469.70 → 3470.12] Others
[3470.12 → 3470.78] In the world
[3470.78 → 3472.74] There is such a thing
[3472.74 → 3474.04] As the wrath of God
[3474.04 → 3475.40] Because there is such a thing
[3475.40 → 3476.42] As the love of God
[3476.42 → 3478.08] Because God actually
[3478.08 → 3479.58] Does care
[3479.58 → 3481.48] Right?
[3481.48 → 3482.74] If there is no
[3482.74 → 3483.54] Holy
[3483.54 → 3484.92] Anger
[3484.92 → 3486.20] Against the evil
[3486.20 → 3486.96] Of the world
[3486.96 → 3487.90] If there is no
[3487.90 → 3489.12] Judgment in response
[3489.12 → 3489.58] To evil
[3489.58 → 3490.68] Then there is no
[3490.68 → 3491.72] Hope for a slave
[3491.72 → 3493.96] Or a rape victim
[3493.96 → 3495.50] Or a child
[3495.50 → 3496.56] Who has been abused
[3496.56 → 3498.04] Or people
[3498.04 → 3498.88] Who have suffered
[3498.88 → 3499.76] Unjustly
[3499.76 → 3500.78] At the hands of others
[3500.78 → 3503.44] So it was
[3503.44 → 3504.30] John's mission
[3504.30 → 3504.98] To say
[3504.98 → 3505.92] Prepare the way
[3505.92 → 3506.32] Of the Lord
[3506.32 → 3507.24] Because everyone
[3507.24 → 3508.80] Is in danger
[3508.80 → 3509.80] Everyone
[3509.80 → 3511.20] Is in danger
[3511.20 → 3512.04] Against the judgment
[3512.04 → 3512.72] Of sin
[3512.72 → 3514.30] And he uses
[3514.30 → 3515.22] This agricultural
[3515.22 → 3515.74] Image
[3515.74 → 3516.10] In verses
[3516.10 → 3516.84] Eight and nine
[3516.84 → 3518.14] We'll just look
[3518.14 → 3518.46] At this
[3518.46 → 3519.02] You know
[3519.02 → 3519.80] These two verses
[3519.80 → 3520.30] Together
[3520.30 → 3521.52] John says
[3521.52 → 3522.32] Produce fruit
[3522.32 → 3522.76] In keeping
[3522.76 → 3523.44] With repentance
[3523.44 → 3524.44] Do not begin
[3524.44 → 3525.32] To say to yourselves
[3525.32 → 3526.38] We have Abraham
[3526.38 → 3527.14] As our father
[3527.14 → 3528.48] For I tell you
[3528.48 → 3529.26] That out of these
[3529.26 → 3529.96] Stones
[3529.96 → 3531.70] God can raise up
[3531.70 → 3532.72] Children for Abraham
[3532.72 → 3534.52] The axe is already
[3534.52 → 3535.06] At the root
[3535.06 → 3535.54] Of the tree
[3535.54 → 3536.52] And every tree
[3536.52 → 3537.18] That does not
[3537.18 → 3538.12] Produce good fruit
[3538.12 → 3539.30] Will be cut down
[3539.30 → 3539.88] And thrown
[3539.88 → 3540.74] Into the fire
[3540.74 → 3543.76] So I just want
[3543.76 → 3544.54] Us to see that
[3544.54 → 3545.94] If all people
[3545.94 → 3546.40] Are to see
[3546.40 → 3546.94] The salvation
[3546.94 → 3547.56] Of God
[3547.56 → 3548.68] Then all people
[3548.68 → 3549.32] Need to
[3549.32 → 3550.38] Do what
[3550.38 → 3551.76] John says
[3551.76 → 3552.58] Which is to
[3552.58 → 3553.46] Repent
[3553.46 → 3554.80] To repent
[3554.80 → 3556.40] And there
[3556.40 → 3557.26] Weren't to be
[3557.26 → 3559.28] Spiritual elites
[3559.28 → 3560.74] You know
[3560.74 → 3561.80] Those who say
[3561.80 → 3562.28] Well we have
[3562.28 → 3563.12] Abraham as our
[3563.12 → 3563.96] Father so
[3563.96 → 3564.60] We don't need
[3564.60 → 3565.34] To be judged
[3565.34 → 3566.28] Right
[3566.28 → 3567.10] There's no
[3567.10 → 3567.80] Some are going
[3567.80 → 3568.20] To be judged
[3568.20 → 3568.76] And some aren't
[3568.76 → 3569.54] Going to be judged
[3569.54 → 3570.92] But whether you
[3570.92 → 3571.48] Are a Jew
[3571.48 → 3572.46] Or a Gentile
[3572.46 → 3573.96] Male or female
[3573.96 → 3574.80] Slave or free
[3574.80 → 3575.50] Young or old
[3575.50 → 3576.16] Rich or poor
[3576.16 → 3576.86] Religious
[3576.86 → 3577.84] Non-religious
[3577.84 → 3579.14] Sinner or saint
[3579.14 → 3580.10] Everyone
[3580.10 → 3581.86] Needs
[3581.86 → 3582.72] To see that
[3582.72 → 3583.30] The salvation
[3583.30 → 3583.72] Of God
[3583.72 → 3584.30] Was coming
[3584.30 → 3585.48] And everyone
[3585.48 → 3586.40] Needs to prepare
[3586.40 → 3586.84] The way
[3586.84 → 3589.58] Even for those
[3589.58 → 3590.12] Who thought
[3590.12 → 3591.10] They had a
[3591.10 → 3591.60] Right
[3591.60 → 3593.04] Religious
[3593.04 → 3593.68] Heritage
[3593.68 → 3594.90] Because they
[3594.90 → 3595.30] Were children
[3595.30 → 3595.82] Of Abraham
[3595.82 → 3598.44] The king
[3598.44 → 3600.00] Who was coming
[3600.00 → 3601.62] Doesn't consider
[3601.62 → 3602.60] Anybody's
[3602.60 → 3604.06] Spiritual or
[3604.06 → 3605.22] Moral resume
[3605.22 → 3606.46] He doesn't
[3606.46 → 3606.94] Look at the
[3606.94 → 3607.34] Resumes
[3607.34 → 3607.82] He doesn't
[3607.82 → 3608.28] Look at
[3608.28 → 3608.98] The good
[3608.98 → 3609.48] Resumes
[3609.48 → 3610.30] He doesn't
[3610.30 → 3610.72] Look at
[3610.72 → 3611.38] The bad
[3611.38 → 3611.86] Resumes
[3611.86 → 3612.60] Everyone
[3612.60 → 3613.76] Needs to
[3613.76 → 3614.16] Prepare
[3614.16 → 3614.80] The way
[3614.80 → 3616.14] For the
[3616.14 → 3616.40] King
[3616.40 → 3617.06] To come
[3617.06 → 3618.64] So John's
[3618.64 → 3619.38] Manor
[3619.38 → 3620.38] Is
[3620.38 → 3621.36] Abrasive
[3621.36 → 3622.08] Like sandpaper
[3622.08 → 3622.48] Because
[3622.48 → 3623.76] His mission
[3623.76 → 3624.94] Is so
[3624.94 → 3626.10] Urgent
[3626.10 → 3629.22] And that
[3629.22 → 3630.82] Leads us
[3630.82 → 3631.52] Then to
[3631.52 → 3631.98] The final
[3631.98 → 3632.34] Point
[3632.34 → 3632.84] We come
[3632.84 → 3633.30] To John's
[3633.30 → 3633.78] Message
[3633.78 → 3634.36] Okay we've
[3634.36 → 3634.62] Looked at
[3634.62 → 3635.22] His manner
[3635.22 → 3636.42] His mission
[3636.42 → 3637.04] To prepare
[3637.04 → 3637.58] The people
[3637.58 → 3638.20] For the
[3638.20 → 3638.70] Coming wrath
[3638.70 → 3639.22] Of God
[3639.22 → 3640.60] And he
[3640.60 → 3640.98] Talks about
[3640.98 → 3641.84] Repentance
[3641.84 → 3642.96] Now let's
[3642.96 → 3643.32] Talk more
[3643.32 → 3643.64] About what
[3643.64 → 3644.04] That means
[3644.04 → 3644.84] This message
[3644.84 → 3645.44] Of John
[3645.44 → 3648.22] The message
[3648.22 → 3649.04] Of John
[3649.04 → 3649.80] In his
[3649.80 → 3650.24] Mission
[3650.24 → 3650.96] Was this
[3650.96 → 3652.32] Repent
[3652.32 → 3653.74] For judgment
[3653.74 → 3654.46] Is coming
[3654.46 → 3655.12] So he says
[3655.12 → 3655.48] Again
[3655.48 → 3656.02] If you look
[3656.02 → 3656.30] At verse
[3656.30 → 3656.66] Eight
[3656.66 → 3658.30] Produce
[3658.30 → 3658.92] Fruit
[3658.92 → 3660.36] In keeping
[3660.36 → 3661.22] With repentance
[3661.22 → 3663.30] That's his
[3663.30 → 3663.64] Message
[3663.64 → 3664.54] Repent
[3664.54 → 3666.08] And produce
[3666.08 → 3666.44] Fruit
[3666.44 → 3666.90] In keeping
[3666.90 → 3667.34] With that
[3667.34 → 3668.00] Repentance
[3668.00 → 3669.10] Because
[3669.10 → 3669.72] Only
[3669.72 → 3670.86] Trees
[3670.86 → 3672.06] That produce
[3672.06 → 3672.76] Fruit
[3672.76 → 3673.78] Showing
[3673.78 → 3674.38] Their repentance
[3674.38 → 3675.48] Will avoid
[3675.48 → 3676.12] The acts
[3676.12 → 3676.68] Of God's
[3676.68 → 3677.24] Judgment
[3677.24 → 3678.48] Judgment
[3678.48 → 3679.16] Is coming
[3679.16 → 3680.34] So repent
[3680.34 → 3682.36] Now
[3682.36 → 3684.32] What does
[3684.32 → 3684.62] That mean
[3684.62 → 3685.42] What are
[3685.42 → 3686.04] You doing
[3686.04 → 3686.72] When you
[3686.72 → 3687.36] Repent
[3687.36 → 3688.42] You know
[3688.42 → 3688.96] It's a word
[3688.96 → 3689.68] That you know
[3689.68 → 3690.38] It's kind of
[3690.38 → 3691.04] It makes us feel
[3691.04 → 3691.56] Maybe a little bit
[3691.56 → 3692.18] Unsettled
[3692.18 → 3692.76] Like repent
[3692.76 → 3693.14] You know
[3693.14 → 3694.26] What am I
[3694.26 → 3694.90] Supposed to do
[3694.90 → 3695.24] There
[3695.24 → 3696.84] But essentially
[3696.84 → 3698.24] It means
[3698.24 → 3698.66] This
[3698.66 → 3699.42] It means
[3699.42 → 3699.82] To
[3699.82 → 3701.00] Transfer
[3701.00 → 3701.74] Your trust
[3701.74 → 3702.88] Okay
[3702.88 → 3703.28] That's it
[3703.28 → 3703.86] It means
[3703.86 → 3704.50] To transfer
[3704.50 → 3705.52] Your trust
[3705.52 → 3707.08] From whatever
[3707.08 → 3707.80] It is
[3707.80 → 3708.34] That it is
[3708.34 → 3709.22] Resting on
[3709.22 → 3709.66] Now
[3709.66 → 3710.72] Whatever
[3710.72 → 3711.46] You're trusting
[3711.46 → 3712.10] In to give
[3712.10 → 3712.58] You a sense
[3712.58 → 3713.14] Of identity
[3713.14 → 3714.30] A sense
[3714.30 → 3715.32] Of purpose
[3715.32 → 3716.04] A sense
[3716.04 → 3716.74] Of joy
[3716.74 → 3718.74] Goodness
[3718.74 → 3719.36] In the world
[3719.36 → 3719.92] Whatever it is
[3719.92 → 3720.92] You're trusting
[3720.92 → 3721.92] In for all
[3721.92 → 3722.38] Of that
[3722.38 → 3723.50] For life
[3723.50 → 3724.10] Itself
[3724.10 → 3725.38] Transfer it
[3725.38 → 3726.80] To Jesus
[3726.80 → 3727.26] Christ
[3727.26 → 3728.58] That's what
[3728.58 → 3728.80] It means
[3728.80 → 3729.26] To repent
[3729.26 → 3729.58] It's
[3729.58 → 3730.10] The word
[3730.10 → 3730.38] Literally
[3730.38 → 3731.04] Means to
[3731.04 → 3732.14] Turn around
[3732.14 → 3732.44] It means
[3732.44 → 3732.96] To change
[3732.96 → 3733.40] Your mind
[3733.40 → 3733.68] It means
[3733.68 → 3733.90] To do
[3733.90 → 3734.42] A U-turn
[3734.42 → 3735.08] You go
[3735.08 → 3735.60] From one
[3735.60 → 3735.98] Direction
[3735.98 → 3736.72] To another
[3736.72 → 3738.24] It's this
[3738.24 → 3739.36] Cosmic shift
[3739.36 → 3740.36] That takes
[3740.36 → 3740.82] Place
[3740.82 → 3741.46] In your
[3741.46 → 3741.92] Life
[3741.92 → 3743.16] You know
[3743.16 → 3743.50] And so
[3743.50 → 3744.00] Sometimes we
[3744.00 → 3744.44] Get confused
[3744.44 → 3745.24] Repentance
[3745.24 → 3745.70] Or like
[3745.70 → 3746.22] Confession
[3746.22 → 3746.44] You know
[3746.44 → 3746.96] Confession
[3746.96 → 3747.64] Is to say
[3747.64 → 3748.38] These are the
[3748.38 → 3748.78] Things that
[3748.78 → 3749.12] I've done
[3749.12 → 3749.52] Wrong
[3749.52 → 3750.22] And it's
[3750.22 → 3750.42] Kind of
[3750.42 → 3751.16] This inventory
[3751.16 → 3751.62] And I
[3751.62 → 3752.10] Say I'm
[3752.10 → 3752.46] Sorry to
[3752.46 → 3752.80] God
[3752.80 → 3754.16] Repentance
[3754.16 → 3754.84] Is this
[3754.84 → 3755.50] Cosmic
[3755.50 → 3755.96] Shift
[3755.96 → 3758.16] From trusting
[3758.16 → 3758.88] Whatever it is
[3758.88 → 3759.36] You're trusting
[3759.36 → 3759.68] In
[3759.68 → 3761.02] Whatever religion
[3761.02 → 3761.94] Whatever anything
[3761.94 → 3763.62] And trust in
[3763.62 → 3764.30] Jesus Christ
[3764.30 → 3765.06] For your life
[3765.06 → 3766.94] John calls
[3766.94 → 3767.50] His hearers
[3767.50 → 3768.40] To repent
[3768.40 → 3769.76] And to
[3769.76 → 3771.18] Then produce
[3771.18 → 3772.02] Fruit
[3772.02 → 3773.18] In keeping
[3773.18 → 3773.54] With that
[3773.54 → 3774.28] Repentance
[3774.28 → 3775.78] Because the
[3775.78 → 3776.52] Evidence
[3776.52 → 3777.00] Of this
[3777.00 → 3778.32] Cosmic shift
[3778.32 → 3779.18] Of trust
[3779.18 → 3780.72] That has
[3780.72 → 3781.18] Happened in
[3781.18 → 3781.80] Your life
[3781.80 → 3784.36] That will
[3784.36 → 3785.24] Cause a
[3785.24 → 3785.84] Blossoming
[3785.84 → 3786.88] It will cause
[3786.88 → 3787.88] A fruitfulness
[3787.88 → 3789.12] This new
[3789.12 → 3789.70] Fruit
[3789.70 → 3790.96] To be
[3790.96 → 3791.38] Produced
[3791.38 → 3791.60] In your
[3791.60 → 3791.84] Life
[3791.84 → 3792.20] As you
[3792.20 → 3792.76] Make this
[3792.76 → 3793.54] Shift
[3793.54 → 3795.88] And as
[3795.88 → 3796.62] John
[3796.62 → 3798.06] Gives that
[3798.06 → 3798.40] Message
[3798.40 → 3799.10] He's
[3799.10 → 3799.96] Proclaiming
[3799.96 → 3800.48] This message
[3800.48 → 3801.20] To repent
[3801.20 → 3802.78] Trust in
[3802.78 → 3803.20] The coming
[3803.20 → 3803.64] Lord
[3803.64 → 3804.04] Jesus
[3804.04 → 3804.56] For your
[3804.56 → 3804.96] Life
[3804.96 → 3805.88] For your
[3805.88 → 3806.42] Salvation
[3806.42 → 3808.34] Who's
[3808.34 → 3809.06] Receptive
[3809.06 → 3809.38] To that
[3809.38 → 3809.86] Message
[3809.86 → 3810.60] Did you
[3810.60 → 3811.02] Notice
[3811.02 → 3812.06] Who is
[3812.06 → 3812.76] Receptive
[3812.76 → 3813.06] To that
[3813.06 → 3813.52] Message
[3813.52 → 3814.92] Well it's
[3814.92 → 3815.62] The outsiders
[3815.62 → 3817.54] The ones
[3817.54 → 3818.06] Who are
[3818.06 → 3818.62] Not really
[3818.62 → 3819.48] Considered
[3819.48 → 3821.36] In the
[3821.36 → 3822.00] Good graces
[3822.00 → 3822.36] Of the
[3822.36 → 3822.82] Community
[3822.82 → 3823.72] Right
[3823.72 → 3823.98] Not
[3823.98 → 3824.24] They're
[3824.24 → 3824.44] Really
[3824.44 → 3824.66] The
[3824.66 → 3825.36] Upstanding
[3825.36 → 3826.40] Respectable
[3826.40 → 3826.88] Citizens
[3826.88 → 3827.88] But the
[3827.88 → 3828.18] Ones
[3828.18 → 3828.42] Who are
[3828.42 → 3828.94] On the
[3828.94 → 3829.52] Margins
[3829.52 → 3830.18] Of society
[3830.18 → 3831.76] Right
[3831.76 → 3832.46] Luke mentions
[3832.46 → 3833.34] Three groups
[3833.34 → 3833.82] Of people
[3833.82 → 3835.68] Who respond
[3835.68 → 3836.46] To John's
[3836.46 → 3836.82] Preaching
[3836.82 → 3837.22] He talks
[3837.22 → 3837.58] About the
[3837.58 → 3838.28] Crowds
[3838.28 → 3839.20] The tax
[3839.20 → 3839.86] Collectors
[3839.86 → 3840.46] And the
[3840.46 → 3841.06] Soldiers
[3841.06 → 3841.94] Right
[3841.94 → 3842.50] So the
[3842.50 → 3842.86] Crowd
[3842.86 → 3843.16] They were
[3843.16 → 3843.68] Known as
[3843.68 → 3844.16] The people
[3844.16 → 3844.70] Of the
[3844.70 → 3845.12] Land
[3845.12 → 3845.96] Just your
[3845.96 → 3846.30] Every day
[3846.30 → 3846.76] Folks
[3846.76 → 3847.14] They weren't
[3847.14 → 3847.58] Really that
[3847.58 → 3848.20] Concerned
[3848.20 → 3848.46] About
[3848.46 → 3849.42] Religious
[3849.42 → 3850.16] Observance
[3850.16 → 3850.56] They didn't
[3850.56 → 3850.96] Really
[3850.96 → 3851.72] So much
[3851.72 → 3852.00] Care
[3852.00 → 3852.28] About
[3852.28 → 3852.54] The
[3852.54 → 3853.00] Torah
[3853.00 → 3853.80] Proper
[3853.80 → 3854.32] Things
[3854.32 → 3854.58] Like
[3854.58 → 3854.92] That
[3854.92 → 3856.10] And they
[3856.10 → 3856.46] Were looked
[3856.46 → 3857.28] Down on
[3857.28 → 3858.24] By the
[3858.24 → 3858.62] Religious
[3858.62 → 3859.02] Leaders
[3859.02 → 3860.46] They probably
[3860.46 → 3861.12] Were quite
[3861.12 → 3862.32] Poor
[3862.32 → 3863.86] Living in
[3863.86 → 3864.22] Poverty
[3864.22 → 3864.70] By our
[3864.70 → 3865.18] Standards
[3865.18 → 3865.62] Most of
[3865.62 → 3865.80] Them
[3865.80 → 3867.48] The tax
[3867.48 → 3868.00] Collectors
[3868.00 → 3868.42] Of course
[3868.42 → 3868.72] They were
[3868.72 → 3869.24] Hated by
[3869.24 → 3869.62] Nearly
[3869.62 → 3870.08] Everybody
[3870.08 → 3871.40] Because they
[3871.40 → 3871.82] Swindled
[3871.82 → 3872.34] People out
[3872.34 → 3872.58] Of their
[3872.58 → 3872.84] Money
[3872.84 → 3873.96] And they
[3873.96 → 3874.30] Worked
[3874.30 → 3874.74] For the
[3874.74 → 3875.28] Gentile
[3875.28 → 3875.68] Romans
[3875.68 → 3876.28] The false
[3876.28 → 3877.00] Occupiers
[3877.00 → 3877.24] Of the
[3877.24 → 3877.56] Land
[3877.56 → 3878.98] Now the
[3878.98 → 3879.42] Soldiers
[3879.42 → 3880.18] Are probably
[3880.18 → 3881.78] Jewish
[3881.78 → 3882.62] Soldiers
[3882.62 → 3883.30] They're probably
[3883.30 → 3884.04] Not Romans
[3884.04 → 3884.96] But here
[3884.96 → 3885.86] Jews
[3885.86 → 3886.58] Who were
[3886.58 → 3887.16] In
[3887.16 → 3888.60] Enlisted
[3888.60 → 3889.40] Into the
[3889.40 → 3889.94] Service of
[3889.94 → 3890.16] Herod
[3890.16 → 3890.30] And
[3890.30 → 3892.16] And then
[3892.16 → 3892.44] They were
[3892.44 → 3892.86] Hated for
[3892.86 → 3893.14] The same
[3893.14 → 3893.48] Reason
[3893.48 → 3894.04] As the
[3894.04 → 3894.26] Tax
[3894.26 → 3894.70] Collectors
[3894.70 → 3895.02] Were
[3895.02 → 3895.54] Because
[3895.54 → 3896.04] They were
[3896.04 → 3896.48] Kind of
[3896.48 → 3896.86] Abusive
[3896.86 → 3897.54] And
[3897.54 → 3898.24] They were
[3898.24 → 3898.80] Disloyal
[3898.80 → 3899.18] To their
[3899.18 → 3899.34] Own
[3899.34 → 3899.66] People
[3899.66 → 3900.10] Right
[3900.10 → 3900.38] Working
[3900.38 → 3900.68] For the
[3900.68 → 3901.22] Oppressors
[3901.22 → 3903.10] And John's
[3903.10 → 3903.38] Manner
[3903.38 → 3904.30] Is abrasive
[3904.30 → 3905.96] Because his
[3905.96 → 3906.48] Mission is
[3906.48 → 3906.94] Urgent
[3906.94 → 3908.28] But for
[3908.28 → 3908.60] Those on
[3908.60 → 3909.34] The outside
[3909.34 → 3910.40] For those
[3910.40 → 3911.04] Who know
[3911.04 → 3912.32] They are
[3912.32 → 3912.88] Sinners
[3912.88 → 3914.40] It doesn't
[3914.40 → 3914.84] Condemn
[3914.84 → 3915.06] Them
[3915.06 → 3916.28] They don't
[3916.28 → 3916.46] Feel
[3916.46 → 3917.00] Condemned
[3917.00 → 3917.48] By it
[3917.48 → 3918.58] But actually
[3918.58 → 3919.58] It produces
[3919.58 → 3920.22] In them
[3920.22 → 3920.84] The desired
[3920.84 → 3921.48] Effect
[3921.48 → 3922.70] They respond
[3922.70 → 3923.80] Their hearts
[3923.80 → 3924.46] Are prepared
[3924.46 → 3925.32] The work
[3925.32 → 3926.22] Of roughing
[3926.22 → 3926.56] Up the
[3926.56 → 3926.94] Services
[3926.94 → 3927.36] So the
[3927.36 → 3927.70] Gospel
[3927.70 → 3928.82] Can stick
[3928.82 → 3929.64] That work
[3929.64 → 3930.02] Has been
[3930.02 → 3930.44] Done
[3930.44 → 3930.82] They
[3930.82 → 3931.88] Respond
[3931.88 → 3932.94] And it
[3932.94 → 3933.12] Leads
[3933.12 → 3933.24] Them
[3933.24 → 3933.50] To ask
[3933.50 → 3934.08] A question
[3934.08 → 3935.26] It's a
[3935.26 → 3935.58] Question
[3935.58 → 3935.84] That's
[3935.84 → 3936.24] Repeated
[3936.24 → 3936.80] Three times

[4088.86 → 4091.04] A lifestyle
[4091.04 → 4091.74] Of repentance
[4091.74 → 4093.56] Is simpler
[4093.56 → 4094.66] Than we
[4094.66 → 4095.16] Make it out
[4095.16 → 4095.50] To be

[4108.42 → 4108.88] Against the

[4119.60 → 4120.02] In your
[4120.02 → 4120.74] Occupation
[4120.74 → 4121.24] Even if
[4121.24 → 4121.64] It's being
[4121.64 → 4122.06] A tax
[4122.06 → 4122.44] Collector
[4122.44 → 4123.04] Or a
[4123.04 → 4123.30] Soldier
[4123.30 → 4123.92] Working for
[4123.92 → 4124.32] The enemy
[4124.32 → 4126.46] He says
[4126.46 → 4127.08] Do what
[4127.08 → 4127.62] Is in
[4127.62 → 4128.32] Your
[4128.32 → 4128.98] Power
[4128.98 → 4129.54] To do
[4129.54 → 4130.72] Right
[4130.72 → 4131.20] Change
[4131.20 → 4132.08] What you
[4132.08 → 4132.58] Have the
[4132.58 → 4132.94] Ability
[4132.94 → 4133.66] To change
[4133.66 → 4135.24] It's a
[4135.24 → 4135.76] Simple
[4135.76 → 4136.84] But powerful
[4136.84 → 4137.38] Message
[4137.38 → 4139.70] Because that
[4139.70 → 4140.10] Is what
[4140.10 → 4140.78] Demonstrates
[4140.78 → 4141.70] True repentance
[4141.70 → 4142.74] Right
[4142.74 → 4143.38] A true
[4143.38 → 4144.50] Change of
[4144.50 → 4145.36] Allegiance
[4145.36 → 4146.50] Transferring
[4146.50 → 4147.00] Your trust
[4147.00 → 4147.46] From something
[4147.46 → 4147.66] Else
[4147.66 → 4148.20] To Jesus
[4148.20 → 4148.92] It's when
[4148.92 → 4149.50] It starts
[4149.50 → 4149.98] To make
[4149.98 → 4150.32] You a
[4150.32 → 4150.62] Different
[4150.62 → 4151.08] Kind
[4151.08 → 4152.04] Of person
[4152.04 → 4153.50] Deeply
[4153.50 → 4153.90] From your
[4153.90 → 4154.30] Heart
[4154.30 → 4155.18] Right
[4155.18 → 4155.62] If
[4155.62 → 4155.88] John
[4155.88 → 4156.30] Says
[4156.30 → 4157.10] Let's
[4157.10 → 4157.42] Rise
[4157.42 → 4157.62] Up
[4157.62 → 4157.86] Against
[4157.86 → 4158.06] The
[4158.06 → 4158.42] Romans
[4158.42 → 4160.58] I mean
[4160.58 → 4160.78] That's
[4160.78 → 4161.00] Not
[4161.00 → 4161.62] Changing
[4161.62 → 4162.18] Anything
[4162.18 → 4162.48] They're
[4162.48 → 4162.80] Already
[4162.80 → 4163.28] Angry
[4163.28 → 4164.12] And frustrated
[4164.12 → 4164.34] It's
[4164.34 → 4164.44] Just
[4164.44 → 4164.60] Kind
[4164.60 → 4164.70] Of
[4164.70 → 4165.00] Taking
[4165.00 → 4165.22] Who
[4165.22 → 4165.40] They
[4165.40 → 4165.78] Are
[4165.78 → 4166.22] And
[4166.22 → 4166.72] Channelling
[4166.72 → 4166.96] It
[4166.96 → 4167.24] In a
[4167.24 → 4167.46] Certain
[4167.46 → 4168.54] Direction
[4168.54 → 4170.24] It is
[4170.24 → 4170.50] Much
[4170.50 → 4170.84] More
[4170.84 → 4171.68] Profound
[4171.68 → 4171.90] It's
[4171.90 → 4172.18] Actually
[4172.18 → 4172.42] Much
[4172.42 → 4172.62] More
[4172.62 → 4173.32] Dramatic
[4173.32 → 4174.78] To
[4174.78 → 4175.24] Say
[4175.24 → 4176.04] Be
[4176.04 → 4176.54] Generous
[4176.54 → 4178.78] That's
[4178.78 → 4178.86] Going
[4178.86 → 4178.92] To
[4178.92 → 4179.36] Require
[4179.36 → 4179.64] Something
[4179.64 → 4179.90] From
[4179.90 → 4180.08] You
[4180.08 → 4180.74] That's

[4183.30 → 4183.48] You
[4183.48 → 4183.94] Value
[4183.94 → 4184.22] What

[4185.32 → 4185.58] In

[4396.90 → 4397.08] By

[4405.12 → 4405.36] That
[4405.36 → 4405.46] Is

[4410.62 → 4410.74] In
[4410.74 → 4411.02] Romans
[4411.02 → 4411.20] We

[4513.24 → 4513.52] For
[4513.52 → 4513.90] The
[4513.90 → 4514.90] Lord
[4514.90 → 4515.52] In
[4515.52 → 4515.86] A
[4515.86 → 4516.30] We
[4516.30 → 4516.82] We
[4516.82 → 4517.34] We
[4517.34 → 4518.46] End
[4518.46 → 4519.34] When
[4519.34 → 4526.46] I'm dry, and I am empty, only dust in my hands.
[4526.98 → 4534.68] How I earn for strength of mercy, where my soul can be restored.
[4534.68 → 4542.60] Come and drink, Jesus calls me, and you will thirst no more.
[4542.60 → 4551.16] Oh, the fullness of Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[4556.16 → 4563.88] With a word who walked among us, his power in any well.
[4563.88 → 4571.54] And you spoke into the darkness, who broke the powers of hell.
[4571.54 → 4579.38] Praise and mercy, come from Calvary to the valley of our need.
[4579.88 → 4586.92] It is done, it is finished, from every sin set free.
[4586.92 → 4595.76] All the victory of Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[4595.76 → 4608.18] How often in this illness have I held your voice.
[4608.18 → 4615.66] Every whisper, every promise, calls my heart to rejoice.
[4615.66 → 4623.46] In the quiet of the morning, through the watches of the night.
[4623.46 → 4631.10] In the fire of the swallows, there's to right for the fight.
[4631.10 → 4639.10] All the power of Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[4639.10 → 4652.02] My soul wants to walk closer, with the Lord myself.
[4652.02 → 4659.54] More than wishes, more than favour, I delight in your words.
[4659.94 → 4663.22] Turn my gaze from all that's worthless.
[4663.22 → 4667.22] Set my heart on things above.
[4667.22 → 4671.22] Make my life to your goodness.
[4671.22 → 4674.22] Your way to fill your love.
[4674.22 → 4683.22] All the wisdom of Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[4683.22 → 4693.22] All the wisdom of Christ, Word of life.
[4693.22 → 4705.48] All right, so we'll continue to worship now by collecting of our tithes and offerings.
[4705.48 → 4715.48] Each week, we have a designated offering for a ministry partner that we like to support for the work that God has called them to do, whether locally or around the world.
[4715.48 → 4724.48] And our offering for today is for Todd Stat ham at UBC Okanagan and his work among university students.
[4724.48 → 4737.48] Every time he shares at classes about the work he's doing, everyone's in rapt attention because it's always so amazing to hear about how lives of college students are being changed by his work in the gospel.
[4737.48 → 4741.48] So, may I invite the deacons to come forward to collect our offering this morning.
[4741.48 → 4761.48] Buddhist kids boyfriend breaks down after Sunday at 30s but just a court with 22.
[4762.48 → 4769.48] It's very insolent that we will always be learning about, and we will present commented Puget quadric age or another time,
[4769.48 → 4771.48] Amen.

[4879.48 → 4880.48] Amen.
[4880.48 → 4881.48] Amen.
[4881.48 → 4887.48] So I think it was so special for Jeremy to officiate the baptism earlier, but I forgot to present
[4887.48 → 4894.48] them the baptism certificate and big picture story Bible, which is a great book, very theologically
[4894.48 → 4895.48] sound.
[4895.48 → 4896.48] So I'm going to give it to them.
[4907.48 → 4908.48] All right.
[4908.48 → 4912.48] Would you join me as we turn our hearts to the Lord in prayer?
[4912.48 → 4922.48] Our gracious God and Father, we come before you, we come now in prayer with expectant hearts.
[4922.48 → 4929.48] We as your people, Lord, await Christ's coming.
[4929.48 → 4936.48] As he once came in humility, so long ago on that first Christmas, he said he will come
[4936.48 → 4951.48] again in glory and when he comes in glory, he will make all things perfect, all things new, all things as you first intended them to be before sin marred your beautiful creation.
[4951.48 → 4954.48] And Father, you are a God of hope.
[4954.48 → 4961.48] And so we ask you open our hearts this morning to welcome your son, our saviour, Jesus Christ.
[4961.48 → 4962.48] Give us hearts that wait patiently.
[4962.48 → 4967.48] Give us hearts that wait lovingly.
[4967.48 → 4974.48] Hearts that wait faithfully for the day of your promised return.
[4974.48 → 4978.48] Maranatha, come soon, Lord Jesus.
[4978.48 → 4984.48] Make earth and heaven one so that we might live with you eternally in your glory.
[4984.48 → 4993.48] And while we wait for that time, Lord, we pray to you for the needs of our church, our community and in the world around us.
[4993.48 → 5003.48] Lord, we thank you for your promises that we are your covenant people, that we were reminded of earlier in the baptism that we witnessed.
[5003.48 → 5015.48] Thank you, Lord, for your goodness to Jeff and Ashley for sustaining them over many years, as Ashley shared, of expectant waiting.
[5015.48 → 5027.48] Lord, we thank you for the joy that they can now have and for the joy that their extended family can have and friends to into all of us here as the church family.
[5027.48 → 5030.48] We celebrate, Lord, your good gifts.
[5030.48 → 5035.48] We welcome a daughter of yours into your covenant community.
[5035.48 → 5039.48] Lord, we pray for Jerry Iron this morning.
[5039.48 → 5043.48] Lord, we thank you for his upcoming birthday this Friday.
[5043.48 → 5049.48] And Lord, as he has expressed, as I think Wayne told me, he wants to live to 100.
[5049.48 → 5057.48] And so, Lord, we ask that, Lord, if it's your will that you would allow him to see another birthday even.
[5057.48 → 5065.48] But, Lord, in the meanwhile, as in his old age, as he suffers with his health, Lord, would you be close to his heart?
[5065.48 → 5069.48] Would you ease any pain and suffering that he has?
[5069.48 → 5082.48] And even though, Lord, sometimes when we get older, our awareness of the surrounding things diminishes, but, Lord, would your presence only increase in his heart and in his awareness?
[5082.48 → 5086.48] Lord, we pray for Todd Stat ham, our ministry partner at BCO.
[5086.48 → 5094.48] Lord, serving your kingdom, we pray that you would give him gospel success as he ministers to university students.
[5094.48 → 5101.48] Lord, would you open up avenues of grace and mercy to those who don't yet know you?
[5101.48 → 5115.48] And, Lord, help Todd to, amongst his fellowship of students who do know you, Lord, to strengthen their faith, to equip them, Lord, for the lives that you are calling them to live for your kingdom.
[5115.48 → 5133.48] Lord, we pray that you would make us also ready instruments of your grace to be instruments in your hands as we interact with those around us, our neighbours, our coworkers, our friends, our family.
[5133.48 → 5143.48] Father, we remember those, many of whom are sick in this time of year with colds, maybe even minor things, those who couldn't join us today because of that.
[5143.48 → 5150.48] And, Lord, would you give them your grace and your blessing to see them through this cold season.
[5150.48 → 5156.48] Lord, be with all of us who are also more susceptible to the influence of getting sick.
[5156.48 → 5158.48] And, Lord, would you keep us in your care.
[5158.48 → 5170.48] And, Lord, we remember those things that are spoken and those things that are unspoken, some of them known only to you, Lord, that we carry in our hearts.
[5170.48 → 5176.48] We pray that you would hear these prayers and be near to all of us in our time of need.
[5176.48 → 5183.48] We ask all of this in the matchless name of Jesus, the Christ, the Messiah, the King, the coming one.
[5183.48 → 5186.48] And it's in his name we pray. Amen.
[5186.48 → 5189.48] Let's all stand.
[5189.48 → 5198.48] And especially if you're, you know, joining us as a guest or a friend or family member, just again, thank you for coming.
[5198.48 → 5200.48] It's great for you to be here.
[5200.48 → 5210.48] We invite you to stay and to join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall through the doors into the hall over there for some coffee and to get to know one another better.
[5210.48 → 5214.48] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5214.48 → 5229.48] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all that we can ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church, in Jesus Christ throughout all generations forever and ever.
[5229.48 → 5230.48] Amen.
[5230.48 → 5234.48] Please remain standing, and we'll sing one more song as we get ready to leave.
[5234.48 → 5255.48] We receive your blessing, we receive your grace, as we walk in the light shining from your face.
