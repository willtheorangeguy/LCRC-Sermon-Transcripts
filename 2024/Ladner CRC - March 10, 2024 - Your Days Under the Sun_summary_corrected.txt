• The book of Ecclesiastes is mentioned as a source for understanding how to live in light of death and contemplate life
• The concept of contemplating death as a Christian is actually contemplating life, and being prepared for death means living well in this world.
• The text discusses the concept of death as a common destiny for all people, regardless of their actions or circumstances.
• King Solomon's book of Ecclesiastes is referenced, and it is mentioned that many attribute its writing to him.
• Death is portrayed as inevitable and affects everyone equally.
• People are characterized as having different personalities and behaviours, including some who act fairly while others act selfishly.
• The importance of appreciating life despite the inevitability of death is emphasized.
• Solomon's complaint about life under the sun is that everyone has the same destiny despite their differences.
• Death doesn't care about how you live or what your faith looks like, it's a heartless power that plows through all humans.
• Despite this reality, God's wisdom is not to give up or act selfishly, but to seek joy and appreciate life's gifts in the present moment.
• Ecclesiastes exhorts readers to enjoy life, eat, drink, and be joyful, as it's impossible to escape suffering entirely.

• Working hard and using one's gifts for God's glory brings satisfaction.
• In the face of death, it is essential to enjoy the good things God has given us as gifts from him.
• We should know and trust in the love of God for us to truly live.
• Death tries to tell us that God is not loving, but the world reveals God's power and wisdom.
• The concept of God's love and existence is questioned when faced with suffering and death.
• The book of Ecclesiastes suggests that God's power and wisdom are evident in creation, but it does not provide a complete understanding of God's nature.
• Death and tragedy can lead to doubts about God's goodness and love.
