[310.00 --> 311.00]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[311.00 --> 313.00]  It's nice to see you all here.
[313.00 --> 318.00]  Last time I did this, I could throw a basketball in many places there, but not this morning.
[318.00 --> 320.00]  Thanks for coming.
[320.00 --> 321.00]  Welcome to you here.
[321.00 --> 322.00]  Welcome if you're a visitor here.
[322.00 --> 326.00]  We'll have coffee after church, so if we don't get a chance to say hello in the early part
[326.00 --> 329.00]  of this service, please hang around for that.
[329.00 --> 332.00]  Some of you are still coming in via YouTube.
[332.00 --> 333.00]  I know you're there.
[333.00 --> 334.00]  I checked.
[334.00 --> 341.00]  Since the beginning of the year, we have averaged 82 views per week, every week since January,
[341.00 --> 344.00]  so welcome to you as well.
[344.00 --> 348.00]  We have a number of things going on in the next couple of weeks.
[348.00 --> 351.00]  Next Sunday evening, we have a hymn sing at 7 o'clock.
[351.00 --> 353.00]  We do that, I guess, maybe once a year.
[353.00 --> 356.00]  We surely are doing it next week at 7 o'clock.
[356.00 --> 360.00]  It's an opportunity to invite your neighbors and friends to come here as well.
[360.00 --> 364.00]  We'll sing some old favorites as well as some new tunes.
[364.00 --> 369.00]  We'll see you here at 7 o'clock next week.
[369.00 --> 371.00]  Elder and deacon nominations.
[371.00 --> 378.00]  As it says in the bulletin, if there are members of our congregation who you think are gifted for the role of elder or deacon,
[378.00 --> 385.00]  please forward the names to our clerk, John Banstra, and do that as soon as possible, no later than tomorrow night.
[385.00 --> 392.00]  Cadets and the Gems are holding their cub car race again this year.
[392.00 --> 395.00]  It's nice to be out of COVID, isn't it?
[395.00 --> 399.00]  And they'll be here on Thursday at 7 o'clock.
[399.00 --> 404.00]  All are welcome to come and watch the race and cheer for your favorite.
[404.00 --> 410.00]  And also, two weeks from now, there's a soup and bun after church on March 17.
[410.00 --> 414.00]  So there's still sign up for you to bring your favorite soup.
[414.00 --> 419.00]  And that will be on the sheets at the foyer this morning.
[419.00 --> 426.00]  This morning, Pastor Jason is continuing his sermon series, Remember Your Death.
[426.00 --> 432.00]  And it continues with the title, If Someone Dies, Will They Live Again?
[432.00 --> 435.00]  Today's offering is for denominational ministry shares.
[435.00 --> 440.00]  It supports mission and ministry both here and abroad.
[440.00 --> 444.00]  And you are welcome to make a contribution this morning.
[444.00 --> 447.00]  There are more details in today's bulletin.
[449.00 --> 456.00]  Beginning our service now, our call to worship is a responsive reading inspired by Psalm 8.
[456.00 --> 462.00]  As usual, I'll read the single arrows and you will come in with the double arrows in response.
[464.00 --> 470.00]  Gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, inspired by the Holy Spirit and blessed by God,
[470.00 --> 475.00]  we come to worship you, the one holy God.
[475.00 --> 481.00]  O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[481.00 --> 485.00]  Your majesty is the music of the starry skies.
[485.00 --> 489.00]  Yet even children of dust can sing your praises.
[489.00 --> 497.00]  In the name of the healer, the provider, and the enabler, let your gratitude and joy be made known.
[497.00 --> 504.00]  O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[504.00 --> 512.00]  Let me lead you in an opening prayer of adoration and asking for God's presence with us this morning.
[512.00 --> 518.00]  Eternal God, once again you have called us to gather for worship.
[519.00 --> 522.00]  And so we come before you this morning with words of praise.
[522.00 --> 534.00]  As we prepare for worship, we ask that you quiet our hearts so that we may hear your voice in the Bible passages read and with your chosen spiritual leaders.
[534.00 --> 543.00]  We pray that you will stir our hearts that we may more faithfully follow Jesus and that you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer.
[543.00 --> 546.00]  Bless those who lead in worship with your spirit.
[546.00 --> 551.00]  May our acts today be another step in offering our lives to you.
[551.00 --> 554.00]  And unite us with your whole church throughout the world.
[554.00 --> 557.00]  Thank you for loving us.
[557.00 --> 560.00]  Join with us as we honor you this morning.
[560.00 --> 567.00]  We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, who with you, the Father, and the Spirit, are one God.
[567.00 --> 568.00]  Amen.
[568.00 --> 578.00]  The Lord's greeting comes to us from selected verses of Psalm 50.
[578.00 --> 583.00]  The mighty one, God, the Lord, speaks and summons the earth.
[583.00 --> 586.00]  From the rising of the sun to where it sets.
[586.00 --> 590.00]  From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
[590.00 --> 593.00]  Our God comes and will not be silent.
[593.00 --> 596.00]  Listen, my people, and I will speak.
[596.00 --> 598.00]  I am God, your God.
[598.00 --> 600.00]  Call on me in the day of trouble.
[600.00 --> 605.00]  I will deliver you and you will honor me.
[605.00 --> 611.00]  Stand if you are able and greet one another around you before we begin some songs of prayer.
[611.00 --> 612.00]  Sometimes partgos will not get but not yet know.
[612.00 --> 613.00]  We'll make you CHARGE.
[613.00 --> 614.00]  Maybe take a significant time.
[614.00 --> 615.00]  Maybe take a replay of the Medical Help, Death Commissioners.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  Every time you have ever heard that we begin because of Jeżeli everybody Panic decided to destroy it.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  Every time you and Sheng knows that people without зной ol' anyone's್,
[618.00 --> 647.98]  Thank you.
[648.00 --> 677.98]  Thank you.
[678.00 --> 680.00]  Thank you.
[708.00 --> 710.00]  Thank you.
[738.00 --> 740.00]  Thank you.
[768.00 --> 770.00]  Thank you.
[798.00 --> 800.00]  Thank you.
[828.00 --> 830.00]  Thank you.
[830.00 --> 832.00]  Thank you.
[832.00 --> 834.00]  Thank you.
[834.00 --> 836.00]  Thank you.
[836.00 --> 838.00]  Thank you.
[838.00 --> 840.00]  Thank you.
[840.00 --> 848.00]  Thank you.
[848.00 --> 862.00]  The thunder outshines the sun, but other majesty rules with justice, only our glory God.
[862.00 --> 880.00]  The thunder outshines the sun, but other majesty rules with justice, only our glory God.
[880.00 --> 884.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[892.00 --> 898.00]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[898.00 --> 903.00]  What other power can raise the dead?
[903.00 --> 909.00]  What other name remains undefeated?
[909.00 --> 914.00]  Only our holy God.
[914.00 --> 924.00]  Come and behold Him, though I am the only.
[924.00 --> 931.00]  I am the only, forever a holy God.
[931.00 --> 937.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[937.00 --> 956.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[956.00 --> 961.00]  What other names do me from my failure?
[961.00 --> 966.00]  Who else would offer His only Son?
[966.00 --> 971.00]  Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[971.00 --> 975.00]  Only our holy God.
[975.00 --> 981.00]  Only my holy God.
[981.00 --> 990.00]  Come and behold Him, though I am the only.
[990.00 --> 997.00]  I am the only, forever a holy God.
[997.00 --> 1002.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1002.00 --> 1012.00]  Come and behold Him, though I am the only.
[1012.00 --> 1013.00]  Jesus Christ is my holy God.
[1013.00 --> 1014.00]  I am the only Savior and love Him.
[1014.00 --> 1015.00]  I am the only, forever a holy God and worship Him.
[1015.00 --> 1019.00]  I am the only, forever a holy God.
[1019.00 --> 1020.00]  I am the only, forever a holy God.
[1020.00 --> 1022.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1022.00 --> 1026.00]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1026.00 --> 1027.00]  Amen.
[1056.00 --> 1057.00]  Amen.
[1086.00 --> 1087.00]  Amen.
[1116.00 --> 1118.00]  Amen.
[1146.00 --> 1148.00]  Amen.
[1176.00 --> 1178.00]  Amen.
[1206.00 --> 1208.00]  Amen.
[1236.00 --> 1248.28]  Our first scripture reading for the morning is from the book of Philippians.
[1248.28 --> 1258.34]  Philippians chapter 3 is on page 874 in your Brown Pew Bibles, hopefully in Iraq near you.
[1258.34 --> 1263.32]  So Philippians, you can turn there with me and we'll have the scripture as well on the
[1263.32 --> 1264.32]  screen.
[1264.32 --> 1282.94]  All right, so Philippians chapter 3 and we'll actually begin with verse 3 and we'll go to
[1282.94 --> 1286.20]  verse 11.
[1286.20 --> 1290.34]  This is a reading from Paul's letter to the Philippians.
[1290.34 --> 1296.96]  For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in
[1296.96 --> 1301.58]  Christ Jesus and who put no confidence in the flesh.
[1301.58 --> 1305.54]  Though I myself have reasons for such confidence.
[1305.54 --> 1312.16]  If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[1312.16 --> 1319.78]  Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[1319.78 --> 1324.92]  of Hebrews, in regard to the law, a Pharisee.
[1324.92 --> 1328.20]  As for zeal, persecuting the church.
[1328.20 --> 1332.18]  As for legalistic righteousness, faultless.
[1332.18 --> 1337.52]  But whatever was to my profit, I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
[1337.52 --> 1344.04]  What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ
[1344.04 --> 1345.90]  Jesus my Lord.
[1345.90 --> 1349.76]  For whose sake I have lost all things.
[1349.76 --> 1356.62]  I consider them rubbish that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness
[1356.62 --> 1361.88]  of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ.
[1361.88 --> 1365.66]  The righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.
[1365.66 --> 1372.38]  I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming
[1372.38 --> 1374.88]  like him in his death.
[1374.88 --> 1381.12]  And so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
[1381.12 --> 1384.62]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1384.62 --> 1389.66]  So we are going to dismiss the children at this time a little bit earlier.
[1389.66 --> 1395.26]  And the reason is they are going to be singing a song on Easter as part of our Easter Sunday
[1395.26 --> 1396.36]  worship.
[1396.36 --> 1402.32]  And so Angeline again has volunteered to rehearse with them for a few minutes each Sunday until
[1402.32 --> 1403.32]  Easter.
[1403.32 --> 1412.82]  So children go ahead and to Sunday school and to practice your song.
[1412.82 --> 1422.48]  And so we are going to be singing a song on Easter Sunday.
[1422.48 --> 1429.22]  Jason's taller than me.
[1429.22 --> 1433.20]  In a time of confession, join me in a responsive reading.
[1433.20 --> 1435.06]  It's organized in a manner of a prayer.
[1435.06 --> 1439.16]  Although we will not be praying, it sounds like a prayer.
[1439.16 --> 1442.12]  Today we too much focus on ourselves and our own tasks.
[1442.12 --> 1446.16]  We could pick nearly anything to be confessing this morning.
[1446.16 --> 1447.86]  We do a variety of things wrong.
[1447.86 --> 1453.62]  This morning it's a focus on how we look at ourselves too often rather than the poor
[1453.62 --> 1456.94]  and less able around us.
[1456.94 --> 1457.98]  This is a responsive reading.
[1457.98 --> 1459.60]  I'll read the usual portion.
[1459.60 --> 1462.66]  Please join us at the appropriate time.
[1462.66 --> 1470.08]  Son of God, we know that in your eyes it is not social status or wealth or reputation
[1470.08 --> 1472.12]  that count.
[1472.12 --> 1477.44]  We confess how easily our lives can become enmeshed in such worldly values.
[1477.44 --> 1481.74]  You risked personal comfort and security when you reached out to those on the edge of your
[1481.74 --> 1489.16]  society, lepers and sinners, people whom others consider unclean.
[1489.16 --> 1496.50]  Forgive us when we fail to meet your challenge to identify with those whom society would call
[1496.50 --> 1497.50]  worthless.
[1497.50 --> 1506.28]  You showed us that the journey of discipleship is a journey into servanthood and powerlessness.
[1506.28 --> 1515.22]  Forgive us for being tempted to pursue power and to favor competition over compassion.
[1515.22 --> 1520.04]  You, Lord, saw the good in everyone and showed us exactly what it means to be the servant of
[1520.04 --> 1521.54]  all.
[1521.54 --> 1551.54] 
[1551.54 --> 1554.86]  Our song of response is, When I Survey the Wondrous Cause.
[1554.86 --> 1557.72]  you
[1557.72 --> 1560.16]  ask the詞
[1560.16 --> 1561.52]  with
[1561.52 --> 1563.34]  L.
[1563.34 --> 1563.40]  Gtro
[1593.34 --> 1595.34]  Amen.
[1623.34 --> 1632.68]  One makes the grace of glory die.
[1633.68 --> 1642.72]  My riches paid my count of cost,
[1642.72 --> 1651.96]  and for contempt of all my pride.
[1653.34 --> 1662.80]  Forbideth Lord that I should boast,
[1663.62 --> 1672.34]  saving the death of Christ my God.
[1672.34 --> 1682.34]  All the vain things that charm me goes,
[1683.34 --> 1692.80]  I sacrifice them through his blood.
[1692.80 --> 1702.26]  Our assurance of pardon comes from Psalm 34, and Psalm 34 deserves some context before we read portions of it.
[1702.26 --> 1711.72]  It turns out it was written by David, and he wrote it after a fairly harrowing experience.
[1711.72 --> 1727.18]  He was trying to get away from Saul and wandered over into Gath with his merry little band.
[1727.18 --> 1731.64]  The story is told in 1 Samuel 21.
[1731.64 --> 1738.64]  David had fled from Saul to Gath, but he wasn't there long before the servants of Achish the king of Gath said,
[1738.64 --> 1745.10]  Isn't this David, of whom the Israelis sing, Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands?
[1745.10 --> 1749.10]  David panicked and decided to act like an insane man.
[1749.10 --> 1756.56]  The deception worked, and David was able to escape.
[1756.56 --> 1758.56]  After that, he wrote Psalm 34.
[1758.56 --> 1761.56]  And in part, he said,
[1761.56 --> 1774.02]  He said,
[1774.02 --> 1804.00]  He said,
[1804.00 --> 1807.46]  I don't know that we've ever sung in this congregation.
[1807.46 --> 1813.46]  And I think there may be some in here who have never, ever sung this song.
[1813.46 --> 1815.46]  Because it's not in the current red hymnal.
[1815.46 --> 1818.46]  It's not in the gray hymnal that's in front of you.
[1818.46 --> 1821.46]  It wasn't in the blue hymnal before that.
[1821.46 --> 1823.46]  It goes back to the red hymnal.
[1823.46 --> 1826.46]  How many remember that red?
[1826.46 --> 1828.46]  Oh, yeah.
[1828.46 --> 1829.92]  A long time ago.
[1829.92 --> 1830.92]  It's called,
[1830.92 --> 1832.92]  Good is the Lord and full of kind compassion.
[1832.92 --> 1834.92]  And it's a powerful tune.
[1834.92 --> 1837.92]  And I assure you, you all will be able to sing it because it's based on,
[1837.92 --> 1840.92]  the tune is based on an old Irish air.
[1840.92 --> 1843.38]  But the words are very powerful.
[1843.38 --> 1847.16]  The first speak to us about God's graciousness to us,
[1847.16 --> 1851.88]  in spite of the fact that we often don't return that graciousness with obedience.
[1852.72 --> 1857.78]  And the second stanza also points out that in the face of a powerful God,
[1858.14 --> 1861.04]  we are like grass that fades in the summer.
[1861.04 --> 1864.28]  And I think that points to our sermon series.
[1864.28 --> 1867.40]  And this song is worthy of singing the two verses.
[1867.40 --> 1869.48]  You will be able to sing it readily.
[1869.48 --> 1871.24]  Why don't you stand to sing it?
[1871.24 --> 1873.34]  Good is the Lord and full of kind compassion.
[1891.04 --> 1897.68]  Good is the Lord and full of kind compassion.
[1897.68 --> 1906.14]  Most hope to ever plenty of sin love.
[1906.98 --> 1914.24]  Which is His grace to all that come we seek in.
[1914.24 --> 1921.44]  God bless the land, bless the land of God.
[1922.72 --> 1929.78]  His father's love, the father's children's children.
[1931.10 --> 1938.28]  Danger and pride to all who fear His name.
[1938.28 --> 1947.32]  For the heroes are in this and our friends here.
[1947.32 --> 1955.54]  He knows that we are just, He knows that we are free.
[1957.54 --> 1964.92]  He's made and died like flowers that grow in beauty.
[1964.92 --> 1972.60]  Like tender glass that soon will disappear.
[1974.60 --> 1981.92]  Howevermore, the love of God is changeless.
[1982.28 --> 1988.82]  Still shown to those who look to Him in fear.
[1988.82 --> 1997.50]  High in the hands, His love is fixed forever.
[1997.50 --> 2006.50]  His bitter grace, our love humble to come.
[2006.50 --> 2015.30]  Blessing our heart through all His one dominion.
[2015.30 --> 2025.54]  Blessed goes for leading over my soul.
[2039.10 --> 2040.90]  John, I'm glad you brought that one back.
[2040.96 --> 2041.50]  That was nice.
[2041.50 --> 2041.92]  Thank you.
[2045.30 --> 2052.26]  all right well good morning
[2052.26 --> 2062.34]  so last Sunday as John mentioned I think we began a new sermon series for this season of Lent
[2062.34 --> 2070.34]  it's a sermon series called remember your death it comes from the kind of ancient Christian practice
[2070.34 --> 2077.54]  the Latin term is memento mori maybe you've heard of that remember your death and this idea of
[2077.54 --> 2087.30]  contemplating death has been for most followers of Jesus throughout the ages actually a weekly if not
[2087.30 --> 2095.78]  daily practice and that may come as a surprise to you but think about this the earliest Christians
[2095.78 --> 2104.74]  where do they meet to worship the catacombs right singing and praying and receiving Holy Communion
[2104.74 --> 2113.38]  surrounded by the bones of their fellow Christians and then think about how through the ages the
[2113.38 --> 2121.38]  walkways to churches often led through graveyards right and so as you kind of briskly trot your way
[2121.38 --> 2128.98]  to the sanctuary on Sunday for church you couldn't help but read the names on the tombstones as you
[2128.98 --> 2139.86]  pass by and not long ago life expectancy was half if not less than half of what it is today
[2140.90 --> 2148.18]  which meant that death was a much more present reality in people's everyday lives right it was
[2148.18 --> 2159.22]  very common for women to die in labor and for many children not to survive to adulthood and so what
[2159.22 --> 2166.10]  did this mean for churches well it meant constant funerals right for most of our brothers and sisters in
[2166.10 --> 2173.30]  Christ in ages past attending a funeral is not something you did every few years but something that might have
[2173.30 --> 2182.50]  been a normal part of your week now if you're thinking to yourself right now thank god that is not true anymore
[2184.10 --> 2192.66]  i half agree with you right advances in medicine and science the availability of nutritious food has
[2192.66 --> 2200.50]  extended life expectancy and it has especially made the world a safer place for pregnant women and children
[2200.50 --> 2212.58]  and for this we are so grateful but there has been other changes in culture surrounding death
[2213.78 --> 2221.86]  that while you know in in our age we live longer and healthier lives yet it has kind of begun to have a debilitating
[2222.82 --> 2232.50]  impact on our souls right we do not we no longer today worship at catacombs we don't have a church graveyard here
[2234.10 --> 2242.50]  we very rarely have funerals with open caskets and most people don't die in their homes as they used to
[2243.14 --> 2249.14]  but rather in a place far removed from our daily lives and even then further removed from our consciousness
[2249.14 --> 2256.58]  we are in our lives it is rare today to see a dead body it is rare today to speak to someone who
[2256.58 --> 2263.94]  knows that they will die soon it's rare to attend a funeral for anyone outside of maybe a close friend
[2263.94 --> 2271.62]  or family member and the result of all of this and our the way our society today views death is that we
[2271.62 --> 2278.74]  find it very awkward to talk about death it's like that moment I don't know how
[2278.74 --> 2283.26]  many of you have seen the Barbie movie I haven't seen the Barbie movie but this
[2283.26 --> 2288.00]  has been such a huge like thing in our culture that I've even you know heard
[2288.00 --> 2292.50]  about this so there's a scene in the Barbie movie where everyone is dancing
[2292.50 --> 2296.62]  to Dua Lipa's dance the night away it's a fun scene everyone's dancing they're
[2296.62 --> 2302.68]  having a good time and the music suddenly stops and kind of does that rack you
[2302.68 --> 2309.04]  know the record screech like thing when Barbie blurts out you guys ever think
[2309.04 --> 2317.56]  about dying and the music stops everyone freezes completely shocked and not
[2317.56 --> 2326.50]  knowing what to say because nobody wants to talk about death it's in very bad
[2326.50 --> 2331.90]  taste right and I'm kind of aware that maybe even doing a sermon series in a
[2331.90 --> 2341.80]  church can feel a little bit like it's bad taste but now why would this diminish
[2341.80 --> 2348.18]  our souls how would this actually weaken our faith and maybe counterintuitively
[2348.18 --> 2354.64]  not talking and thinking about death how does that rob us of joy well here's how
[2354.64 --> 2360.04]  that's why we're going to talk about that because the Christian gospel is an answer to a question
[2360.04 --> 2374.04]  okay the gospel is an answer to a question the question of death and the question is is there any hope is there any purpose is there any meaning if death swallows up everything in the end
[2374.04 --> 2392.44]  and the gospel answers the question yes there is there is there is a resurrection we have hope we have purpose we have meaning but if you take away the question if you never think about or talk about death then the answer doesn't make much sense if you tell people today
[2392.44 --> 2419.44]  Christ died for you he rose again right nobody cares about an answer without a question and if we remove then the question of death the answer of the gospel isn't very interesting and it certainly doesn't bring the hope and joy that we so desperately need and so if we insulate ourselves from thoughts and fears of death we will inadvertently
[2419.44 --> 2441.44]  insulate ourselves from the joy and hope of the hope of the gospel and that's why during the season of lent we're just going to take a few weeks to talk about this really awkward question in our culture the question of death so that we can then take joy and comfort in the answer to that question which is the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2441.44 --> 2458.08]  Christ so I know is a little bit of a long introduction but let's go ahead now and open our passage for today we're going to be in the book of Job we're looking at different passages in this series so please turn with me in your Bible to Job chapter 14
[2458.08 --> 2469.24]  and we'll read the whole chapter verses 1 to 22 that is on page 382 in your pew Bible Job 14 1 to 22
[2469.24 --> 2481.00]  man born of woman is a few days and full of trouble he springs up like a flower and withers away
[2481.00 --> 2495.74]  like a fleeting shadow and does not endure do you fix your eyes on such a one will you bring him before you before you for judgment who can bring what is pure from the impure
[2495.74 --> 2503.98]  no one man's days are determined you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed
[2503.98 --> 2511.04]  so look away from him and let him alone till he has put in his time like a hired man
[2511.04 --> 2518.12]  at least there is hope for a tree if it is cut down it will sprout again and this new shoots will not fail
[2518.12 --> 2521.90]  its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil
[2521.90 --> 2526.56]  yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant
[2526.56 --> 2532.62]  but man dies and is laid low he breathes his last and is no more
[2532.62 --> 2537.54]  as water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry
[2537.54 --> 2542.60]  so man lies down and does not rise till the heavens are no more
[2542.60 --> 2546.20]  men will not awake or be roused from their sleep
[2546.20 --> 2552.74]  if only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed
[2552.74 --> 2556.18]  if only you would set a time and then remember me
[2556.18 --> 2558.94]  if a man dies will he live again
[2558.94 --> 2563.68]  all the days of my hard service i will wait for my renewal to come
[2563.68 --> 2568.66]  you will call and i will answer you you will long for the creature your hands have made
[2568.66 --> 2573.22]  surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin
[2573.22 --> 2579.04]  my offenses will be sealed up in a bag you will cover over my sin
[2579.04 --> 2583.98]  but as the mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place
[2583.98 --> 2587.58]  as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil
[2587.58 --> 2593.20]  so you destroy man's hope you overpower him once for all and he is gone
[2593.20 --> 2595.98]  you change his countenance and send him away
[2595.98 --> 2600.54]  if his sons are honored he does not know it if they are brought low he does not see it
[2600.54 --> 2605.48]  he feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself
[2605.48 --> 2607.54]  this is the word of the lord
[2607.54 --> 2612.92]  let's pray together
[2612.92 --> 2617.66]  heavenly father we thank you for your word
[2617.66 --> 2621.26]  we thank you that your word is true and that you give it to us
[2621.26 --> 2626.20]  even a passage like joe 14 because you love us
[2626.20 --> 2629.74]  would you give us the grace that we need now
[2629.74 --> 2632.84]  to talk about this problem of death
[2632.84 --> 2636.12]  so that we might then find hope and joy and comfort
[2636.12 --> 2638.36]  in your promises to us in the gospel
[2638.36 --> 2641.62]  we pray for the help of your holy spirit
[2641.62 --> 2645.52]  in the name of jesus our lord
[2645.52 --> 2647.20]  we pray amen
[2647.20 --> 2651.20]  so there's a character
[2651.20 --> 2653.20]  ivan ilovich
[2653.20 --> 2655.12]  i'm probably not saying that right it's a russian name
[2655.12 --> 2655.92]  ivan ilovich
[2655.92 --> 2660.00]  he is the main character in one of leo tolstoy's
[2660.00 --> 2663.56]  most famous short stories called the death of ivan ilovich
[2663.56 --> 2666.48]  so when we meet ivan
[2666.48 --> 2668.36]  his life
[2668.36 --> 2669.66]  is going
[2669.66 --> 2670.80]  so well
[2670.80 --> 2673.26]  his life is at its peak
[2673.26 --> 2677.40]  he has this illustrious career as a magistrate in the government
[2677.40 --> 2679.50]  he is wealthy
[2679.50 --> 2681.08]  he is handsome
[2681.08 --> 2683.20]  he is well liked and admired
[2683.20 --> 2684.22]  he is successful
[2684.22 --> 2689.84]  his own mortality is far from his mind
[2689.84 --> 2694.64]  one day while ivan is cleaning a window in his home
[2694.64 --> 2696.26]  he's standing up on a tall ladder
[2696.26 --> 2698.52]  and he slips and falls
[2698.52 --> 2701.60]  and at first it seems like it's not a big deal
[2701.60 --> 2703.94]  maybe he just suffered a minor injury
[2703.94 --> 2706.00]  but mysteriously
[2706.00 --> 2707.58]  this injury
[2707.58 --> 2708.94]  leads slowly
[2708.94 --> 2710.24]  towards his death
[2710.24 --> 2712.98]  and the rest of the story
[2712.98 --> 2713.80]  is him
[2713.80 --> 2716.36]  trying to wrestle with it
[2716.36 --> 2717.36]  come to grips
[2717.36 --> 2719.26]  with his impending death
[2719.26 --> 2722.64]  and what's most surprising to him
[2722.64 --> 2725.88]  is that as his condition gets worse and worse
[2725.88 --> 2727.80]  he's kind of just like lying in his bed
[2727.80 --> 2729.50]  all alone
[2729.50 --> 2730.26]  and dying
[2730.26 --> 2733.50]  listening to the sounds of his family and friends
[2733.50 --> 2737.14]  carrying on their lives without him
[2737.14 --> 2738.72]  he is
[2738.72 --> 2742.04]  so disoriented by this
[2742.04 --> 2745.26]  because he's thinking like
[2745.26 --> 2746.96]  how is everyone just kind of
[2746.96 --> 2749.16]  continuing on with their lives
[2749.16 --> 2750.40]  without him
[2750.40 --> 2753.22]  he thought that to his friends and family
[2753.22 --> 2755.36]  he was just too important
[2755.36 --> 2756.30]  to die
[2756.30 --> 2759.04]  you know and friends
[2759.04 --> 2759.70]  like ivan
[2759.70 --> 2761.04]  and like a lot of us
[2761.04 --> 2762.22]  maybe even all of us
[2762.22 --> 2765.20]  we too feel at some gut level
[2765.20 --> 2768.02]  that we are too important
[2768.02 --> 2769.34]  to die
[2769.34 --> 2772.16]  and there are a lot of reasons for this
[2772.16 --> 2773.80]  but not least of which
[2773.80 --> 2776.34]  is that you and i
[2776.34 --> 2778.34]  are the main characters
[2778.34 --> 2779.94]  in our own story
[2779.94 --> 2780.80]  right
[2780.80 --> 2781.86]  we are the main characters
[2781.86 --> 2782.52]  in our story
[2782.52 --> 2783.40]  right
[2783.40 --> 2784.50]  in every good story
[2784.50 --> 2786.46]  you can lose the supporting cast
[2786.46 --> 2787.64]  you can't
[2787.64 --> 2789.64]  but you can't lose the main character
[2789.64 --> 2790.90]  right
[2790.90 --> 2791.84]  if you lose the main character
[2791.84 --> 2792.58]  the story is over
[2792.58 --> 2794.14]  so maybe if you're watching a movie
[2794.14 --> 2795.18]  and like the main character
[2795.18 --> 2796.06]  right in the beginning
[2796.06 --> 2797.22]  is in like mortal danger
[2797.22 --> 2798.86]  are you very worried?
[2799.86 --> 2800.26]  no
[2800.26 --> 2801.72]  because you know he's going to be fine
[2801.72 --> 2803.42]  because the movie is longer than 10 minutes long
[2803.42 --> 2804.04]  okay
[2804.04 --> 2805.46]  you can't lose the main character
[2805.46 --> 2807.24]  and therefore
[2807.24 --> 2809.44]  as people who think of themselves
[2809.44 --> 2810.76]  as the main character
[2810.76 --> 2812.08]  in their own stories
[2812.08 --> 2814.64]  we feel we are too important
[2814.64 --> 2815.54]  to die
[2815.54 --> 2818.02]  and now this is interesting
[2818.02 --> 2819.48]  because this is actually
[2819.48 --> 2822.30]  the original sin of humanity
[2822.30 --> 2823.48]  right
[2823.48 --> 2825.26]  if you think about the story of scripture
[2825.26 --> 2827.48]  and especially if you begin at the beginning
[2827.48 --> 2827.96]  right
[2827.96 --> 2829.26]  in genesis chapter 3
[2829.26 --> 2830.90]  what you find
[2830.90 --> 2833.02]  is that the great sin of human beings
[2833.02 --> 2833.80]  in the beginning
[2833.80 --> 2835.84]  is to put themselves
[2835.84 --> 2837.54]  at the center of the universe
[2837.54 --> 2839.80]  we wanted to elevate ourselves
[2839.80 --> 2841.64]  to be the center of the story
[2841.64 --> 2843.76]  seeking to displace God
[2843.76 --> 2844.88]  God was at the center
[2844.88 --> 2846.46]  we wanted to be there
[2846.46 --> 2849.90]  so but God
[2849.90 --> 2850.92]  the Bible tells us
[2850.92 --> 2852.14]  who created the heavens
[2852.14 --> 2852.62]  and the earth
[2852.62 --> 2853.54]  and all things
[2853.54 --> 2855.94]  he is the main character
[2855.94 --> 2856.54]  of the story
[2856.54 --> 2859.22]  but as human beings
[2859.22 --> 2860.86]  we were unsatisfied with that
[2860.86 --> 2863.36]  and we sought to make ourselves
[2863.36 --> 2865.16]  the main character of the story
[2865.16 --> 2866.08]  instead of God
[2866.08 --> 2868.80]  and so as human beings
[2868.80 --> 2870.14]  we rebelled against God
[2870.14 --> 2873.06]  we tried to usurp his position
[2873.06 --> 2875.24]  and in our fall into sin
[2875.24 --> 2877.22]  therefore we receive the wages of sin
[2877.22 --> 2877.90]  which is death
[2877.90 --> 2879.58]  in a sense
[2879.58 --> 2882.24]  removing us from the center of the story
[2882.24 --> 2884.04]  and friends
[2884.04 --> 2884.84]  this is why
[2884.84 --> 2886.46]  our own death
[2886.46 --> 2888.76]  is so humbling
[2888.76 --> 2891.34]  and even humiliating
[2891.34 --> 2893.84]  because death tells us
[2893.84 --> 2895.40]  you are not
[2895.40 --> 2896.28]  the main character
[2896.28 --> 2896.88]  in the story
[2896.88 --> 2897.70]  right
[2897.70 --> 2898.88]  you are not
[2898.88 --> 2900.52]  too important
[2900.52 --> 2901.16]  to die
[2901.16 --> 2903.26]  and this is what
[2903.26 --> 2904.66]  the author of the book of Job
[2904.66 --> 2905.54]  is reflecting on
[2905.54 --> 2907.14]  in chapter 14
[2907.14 --> 2908.24]  okay
[2908.24 --> 2909.00]  so here is what
[2909.00 --> 2909.60]  the book of Job
[2909.60 --> 2910.14]  is all about
[2910.14 --> 2911.08]  if you are not aware
[2911.08 --> 2912.32]  so Job
[2912.32 --> 2913.56]  is this really
[2913.56 --> 2915.40]  incredible character
[2915.40 --> 2917.78]  he is wealthy
[2917.78 --> 2919.28]  he is prosperous
[2919.28 --> 2921.18]  he is well liked
[2921.18 --> 2921.92]  in his community
[2921.92 --> 2922.94]  people respect him
[2922.94 --> 2924.38]  and he's got this family
[2924.38 --> 2925.16]  that loves him
[2925.16 --> 2925.92]  he's got a wife
[2925.92 --> 2927.38]  he's got all these adult children
[2927.38 --> 2928.32]  and their spouses
[2928.32 --> 2930.16]  and they love each other well
[2930.16 --> 2931.68]  and they love to be together
[2931.68 --> 2935.26]  but right at the beginning
[2935.26 --> 2936.16]  of the story
[2936.16 --> 2937.18]  Job
[2937.18 --> 2938.72]  loses everything
[2938.72 --> 2940.92]  he loses his family
[2940.92 --> 2942.90]  he loses his health
[2942.90 --> 2944.64]  his worldly possessions
[2944.64 --> 2945.74]  his success
[2945.74 --> 2946.38]  his reputation
[2946.38 --> 2947.80]  and he is barely
[2947.80 --> 2949.08]  hanging on to hope
[2949.08 --> 2951.20]  and the book of Job
[2951.20 --> 2952.88]  is then this extended conversation
[2952.88 --> 2954.82]  that Job has
[2954.82 --> 2955.44]  with his friends
[2955.44 --> 2956.26]  and with God
[2956.26 --> 2958.10]  reflecting on all that
[2958.10 --> 2958.82]  he has lost
[2958.82 --> 2959.72]  and kind of processing
[2959.72 --> 2960.42]  through all that
[2960.42 --> 2962.30]  and then chapter 14
[2962.30 --> 2964.04]  is his reflection
[2964.04 --> 2964.80]  on death
[2964.80 --> 2967.78]  now what we're going to do
[2967.78 --> 2968.48]  is we're going to just
[2968.48 --> 2969.46]  examine Job
[2969.46 --> 2970.62]  chapter 14
[2970.62 --> 2972.26]  and what we're going to be
[2972.26 --> 2972.96]  thinking about
[2972.96 --> 2973.72]  is
[2973.72 --> 2975.04]  death
[2975.04 --> 2976.02]  in our search
[2976.02 --> 2976.74]  for identity
[2976.74 --> 2977.72]  okay
[2977.72 --> 2978.02]  death
[2978.02 --> 2978.50]  in our search
[2978.50 --> 2979.32]  for identity
[2979.32 --> 2980.86]  so death
[2980.86 --> 2982.34]  raises all sorts
[2982.34 --> 2982.94]  of problems
[2982.94 --> 2983.58]  for us
[2983.58 --> 2984.68]  but the first problem
[2984.68 --> 2985.72]  death raises for us
[2985.72 --> 2986.62]  as individuals
[2986.62 --> 2988.22]  is this problem
[2988.22 --> 2989.40]  of identity
[2989.40 --> 2990.00]  who
[2990.00 --> 2991.18]  we are
[2991.18 --> 2993.12]  and the message
[2993.12 --> 2994.10]  of death
[2994.10 --> 2995.14]  says to us
[2995.14 --> 2996.26]  that you are not
[2996.26 --> 2996.80]  too important
[2996.80 --> 2997.32]  to die
[2997.32 --> 3000.86]  so let's take a look
[3000.86 --> 3001.44]  at our text
[3001.44 --> 3003.38]  and let's see this
[3003.38 --> 3004.28]  now again
[3004.28 --> 3005.54]  like Job 14
[3005.54 --> 3007.26]  this is not one of those passages
[3007.26 --> 3008.08]  where like
[3008.08 --> 3009.48]  you wake up in the morning
[3009.48 --> 3010.54]  you're going to get yourself
[3010.54 --> 3011.40]  a cup of coffee
[3011.40 --> 3012.44]  you're going to sit by the window
[3012.44 --> 3013.42]  in your comfortable chair
[3013.42 --> 3014.74]  and you know
[3014.74 --> 3015.92]  you want to have a devotional time
[3015.92 --> 3016.38]  with God
[3016.38 --> 3018.34]  not usually
[3018.34 --> 3019.20]  Job 14
[3019.20 --> 3021.04]  but nevertheless
[3021.04 --> 3023.32]  there are things here
[3023.32 --> 3024.38]  that God wants us to hear
[3024.38 --> 3025.52]  okay so
[3025.52 --> 3027.12]  beginning in verse 1
[3027.12 --> 3030.22]  mortals
[3030.22 --> 3031.12]  born of women
[3031.12 --> 3032.84]  are a few days
[3032.84 --> 3033.60]  and full of trouble
[3033.60 --> 3034.62]  they spring up
[3034.62 --> 3035.30]  like flowers
[3035.30 --> 3036.28]  and wither away
[3036.28 --> 3037.46]  like fleeting shadows
[3037.46 --> 3038.48]  they do not endure
[3038.48 --> 3040.64]  then
[3040.64 --> 3041.42]  verse 5
[3041.42 --> 3042.20]  a person's days
[3042.20 --> 3042.86]  are determined
[3042.86 --> 3044.06]  you have decreed
[3044.06 --> 3045.10]  the number of his months
[3045.10 --> 3046.18]  and have set limits
[3046.18 --> 3047.30]  he cannot
[3047.30 --> 3048.64]  exceed
[3048.64 --> 3050.56]  and so the first thing
[3050.56 --> 3051.00]  that death
[3051.00 --> 3052.28]  says to you
[3052.28 --> 3053.86]  is that your life
[3053.86 --> 3054.38]  is short
[3054.38 --> 3056.06]  and it will come
[3056.06 --> 3056.66]  to an end
[3056.66 --> 3059.20]  this seems obvious
[3059.20 --> 3060.70]  but if you think
[3060.70 --> 3061.34]  about it
[3061.34 --> 3063.14]  you have
[3063.14 --> 3064.48]  a very specific
[3064.48 --> 3065.76]  number of days
[3065.76 --> 3067.08]  until you die
[3067.08 --> 3068.34]  right
[3068.34 --> 3068.82]  all of us
[3068.82 --> 3069.32]  me you
[3069.32 --> 3069.98]  all of us
[3069.98 --> 3071.74]  so let me ask you
[3071.74 --> 3073.48]  if it were possible
[3073.48 --> 3075.26]  would you want
[3075.26 --> 3076.10]  to know
[3076.10 --> 3077.56]  when you're going
[3077.56 --> 3077.98]  to die
[3077.98 --> 3080.58]  if it was possible
[3080.58 --> 3081.58]  would you
[3081.58 --> 3083.24]  want to know
[3083.24 --> 3084.32]  when
[3084.32 --> 3085.94]  you're going
[3085.94 --> 3086.46]  to die
[3086.46 --> 3087.72]  so a little audience
[3087.72 --> 3088.38]  participation
[3088.38 --> 3089.26]  don't be afraid
[3089.26 --> 3089.68]  to vote
[3089.68 --> 3091.72]  please raise your hand
[3091.72 --> 3093.24]  yes I want
[3093.24 --> 3093.94]  to know
[3093.94 --> 3098.00]  two three
[3098.00 --> 3099.36]  wow okay
[3099.36 --> 3101.48]  no I don't want
[3101.48 --> 3101.92]  to know
[3101.92 --> 3102.76]  assuming that's
[3102.76 --> 3103.36]  everyone else
[3103.36 --> 3104.12]  okay
[3104.12 --> 3105.86]  so there you have it
[3105.86 --> 3107.84]  I can kind of see
[3107.84 --> 3108.68]  it going both ways
[3108.68 --> 3109.76]  right
[3109.76 --> 3110.68]  to know the hour
[3110.68 --> 3111.26]  of my death
[3111.26 --> 3111.84]  would make
[3111.84 --> 3112.90]  maybe easier
[3112.90 --> 3113.72]  to live my life
[3113.72 --> 3114.34]  with courage
[3114.34 --> 3116.24]  and to pace myself
[3116.24 --> 3116.52]  right
[3116.52 --> 3117.48]  if I'm running
[3117.48 --> 3117.98]  in a race
[3117.98 --> 3118.58]  I want to know
[3118.58 --> 3119.90]  is this a marathon
[3119.90 --> 3121.16]  or is this a sprint
[3121.16 --> 3123.20]  because the answer
[3123.20 --> 3124.30]  changes the strategy
[3124.30 --> 3125.10]  for how I run
[3125.10 --> 3126.58]  so yes
[3126.58 --> 3127.42]  I can see the benefit
[3127.42 --> 3127.90]  of knowing
[3127.90 --> 3128.50]  when I'm going
[3128.50 --> 3128.84]  to die
[3128.84 --> 3130.44]  on the other hand
[3130.44 --> 3131.12]  to know the hour
[3131.12 --> 3131.70]  of my death
[3131.70 --> 3132.84]  might rob me
[3132.84 --> 3133.60]  of happiness
[3133.60 --> 3135.12]  and given
[3135.12 --> 3136.14]  my track record
[3136.14 --> 3137.00]  I don't know
[3137.00 --> 3137.52]  about you
[3137.52 --> 3138.26]  but I would
[3138.26 --> 3139.40]  probably procrastinate
[3139.40 --> 3140.40]  and I would
[3140.40 --> 3141.20]  live selfishly
[3141.20 --> 3141.78]  until the last
[3141.78 --> 3142.32]  three minutes
[3142.32 --> 3144.92]  so maybe
[3144.92 --> 3145.78]  not knowing
[3145.78 --> 3146.28]  will actually
[3146.28 --> 3147.24]  keep me on my feet
[3147.24 --> 3147.88]  keep me living
[3147.88 --> 3148.76]  more courageously
[3148.76 --> 3149.52]  and to live
[3149.52 --> 3150.16]  every minute
[3150.16 --> 3150.94]  more fully
[3150.94 --> 3152.24]  and with greater
[3152.24 --> 3153.10]  gratitude to God
[3153.10 --> 3155.00]  and of course
[3155.00 --> 3155.80]  in God's wisdom
[3155.80 --> 3156.50]  this is the way
[3156.50 --> 3156.88]  that God
[3156.88 --> 3157.70]  has arranged it
[3157.70 --> 3159.08]  we do not know
[3159.08 --> 3159.70]  how many days
[3159.70 --> 3160.48]  we have to live
[3160.48 --> 3161.58]  but God
[3161.58 --> 3162.54]  has determined
[3162.54 --> 3164.10]  that number
[3164.10 --> 3164.58]  of days
[3164.58 --> 3165.14]  for each one
[3165.14 --> 3165.60]  of us
[3165.60 --> 3168.10]  so not only
[3168.10 --> 3168.58]  will life
[3168.58 --> 3168.92]  one day
[3168.92 --> 3169.90]  come to an end
[3169.90 --> 3171.06]  Job reminds us
[3171.06 --> 3172.46]  death also says
[3172.46 --> 3173.52]  you can't come back
[3173.52 --> 3175.12]  you can't come back
[3175.12 --> 3176.06]  verse 7
[3176.06 --> 3178.00]  at least there is
[3178.00 --> 3178.84]  hope for a tree
[3178.84 --> 3180.14]  if it is cut down
[3180.14 --> 3181.36]  it will sprout again
[3181.36 --> 3182.44]  its new shoots
[3182.44 --> 3183.28]  will not fail
[3183.28 --> 3184.74]  its roots may grow
[3184.74 --> 3185.72]  old in the ground
[3185.72 --> 3186.28]  and its stump
[3186.28 --> 3187.30]  die in the soil
[3187.30 --> 3188.56]  yet at the scent
[3188.56 --> 3189.14]  of water
[3189.14 --> 3189.90]  it will bud
[3189.90 --> 3190.82]  and put forth
[3190.82 --> 3191.44]  sorry
[3191.44 --> 3192.10]  put forth
[3192.10 --> 3192.52]  shoots
[3192.52 --> 3193.60]  like a plant
[3193.60 --> 3195.64]  so Job is using
[3195.64 --> 3196.14]  this metaphor
[3196.14 --> 3197.02]  of this tree
[3197.02 --> 3197.26]  right
[3197.26 --> 3198.12]  it's cut down
[3198.12 --> 3199.30]  but if it can get
[3199.30 --> 3199.92]  to water
[3199.92 --> 3200.92]  it will grow again
[3200.92 --> 3201.84]  the tree will
[3201.84 --> 3202.88]  grow again
[3202.88 --> 3203.50]  and come back
[3203.50 --> 3205.46]  but this doesn't
[3205.46 --> 3206.24]  happen with people
[3206.24 --> 3207.68]  death says
[3207.68 --> 3209.18]  you can't come back
[3209.18 --> 3211.46]  death also says
[3211.46 --> 3212.50]  the moment you're gone
[3212.50 --> 3214.58]  you are really gone
[3214.58 --> 3215.80]  verse 10
[3215.80 --> 3217.80]  but a man dies
[3217.80 --> 3218.78]  and is laid low
[3218.78 --> 3219.60]  he breathes
[3219.60 --> 3220.14]  his last
[3220.14 --> 3220.96]  and is
[3220.96 --> 3222.12]  no more
[3222.12 --> 3223.78]  now the NIV
[3223.78 --> 3224.62]  here the translation
[3224.62 --> 3225.26]  we're using
[3225.26 --> 3227.44]  it doesn't translate
[3227.44 --> 3228.84]  it as a question
[3228.84 --> 3229.10]  right
[3229.10 --> 3229.62]  the question
[3229.62 --> 3231.30]  so in the Hebrew text
[3231.30 --> 3233.22]  it actually leaves
[3233.22 --> 3234.28]  this haunting question
[3234.28 --> 3234.96]  at the end
[3234.96 --> 3236.66]  but a man dies
[3236.66 --> 3237.30]  and is laid low
[3237.30 --> 3237.88]  he breathes
[3237.88 --> 3238.32]  his last
[3238.32 --> 3239.42]  and where
[3239.42 --> 3240.48]  is he
[3240.48 --> 3244.62]  if you've ever
[3244.62 --> 3245.54]  been to a funeral
[3245.54 --> 3246.54]  with an open
[3246.54 --> 3247.02]  casket
[3247.02 --> 3248.78]  if you've ever
[3248.78 --> 3249.30]  seen
[3249.30 --> 3250.70]  a dead body
[3250.70 --> 3252.50]  then you know
[3252.50 --> 3253.28]  this question
[3253.28 --> 3254.82]  because there
[3254.82 --> 3255.80]  in front of your eyes
[3255.80 --> 3256.88]  is the person
[3256.88 --> 3258.66]  with all the same
[3258.66 --> 3259.64]  physical stuff
[3259.64 --> 3260.34]  of that person
[3260.34 --> 3261.44]  that you knew
[3261.44 --> 3261.98]  and loved
[3261.98 --> 3263.70]  and yet
[3263.70 --> 3264.92]  you know
[3264.92 --> 3266.34]  they are not there
[3266.34 --> 3268.30]  they breathe
[3268.30 --> 3268.82]  their last
[3268.82 --> 3269.80]  and where
[3269.80 --> 3270.98]  are they
[3270.98 --> 3272.40]  they're not there
[3272.40 --> 3273.60]  death says
[3273.60 --> 3274.36]  the moment you die
[3274.36 --> 3275.34]  you are really gone
[3275.34 --> 3278.12]  death also says
[3278.12 --> 3279.72]  it always wins
[3279.72 --> 3281.06]  verse 18
[3281.06 --> 3283.00]  verse 18
[3283.00 --> 3284.06]  but as a mountain
[3284.06 --> 3285.24]  erodes and crumbles
[3285.24 --> 3286.22]  as a rock
[3286.22 --> 3286.68]  is moved
[3286.68 --> 3287.56]  from its place
[3287.56 --> 3288.22]  as water
[3288.22 --> 3289.46]  wears away stones
[3289.46 --> 3290.02]  and torrents
[3290.02 --> 3290.92]  wash away the soil
[3290.92 --> 3291.96]  so you destroy
[3291.96 --> 3292.86]  a person's hope
[3292.86 --> 3294.70]  in other words
[3294.70 --> 3296.22]  death is the strongest
[3296.22 --> 3297.44]  force that any of us
[3297.44 --> 3298.24]  will ever experience
[3298.24 --> 3298.88]  in this life
[3298.88 --> 3301.38]  it wins
[3301.38 --> 3302.08]  every
[3302.08 --> 3302.94]  time
[3302.94 --> 3305.98]  and finally
[3305.98 --> 3306.70]  death says
[3306.70 --> 3307.66]  the world moves on
[3307.66 --> 3308.30]  without you
[3308.30 --> 3309.38]  verse 21
[3309.38 --> 3311.72]  if their children
[3311.72 --> 3312.44]  are honored
[3312.44 --> 3313.46]  they do not know it
[3313.46 --> 3314.40]  if their offspring
[3314.40 --> 3315.18]  are brought low
[3315.18 --> 3317.16]  they do not see it
[3317.16 --> 3318.42]  right
[3318.42 --> 3319.14]  and so the image
[3319.14 --> 3320.00]  here is of a parent
[3320.00 --> 3321.42]  that has died
[3321.42 --> 3322.10]  and their children
[3322.10 --> 3322.88]  are just going through
[3322.88 --> 3323.94]  all the ups and downs
[3323.94 --> 3324.56]  of life
[3324.56 --> 3325.84]  and they are not
[3325.84 --> 3326.40]  a part of it
[3326.40 --> 3327.34]  they don't know
[3327.34 --> 3329.34]  death says
[3329.34 --> 3330.48]  the world moves on
[3330.48 --> 3331.02]  without you
[3331.02 --> 3334.26]  so let's summarize
[3334.26 --> 3335.18]  death says
[3335.18 --> 3336.12]  your life is fleeting
[3336.12 --> 3337.16]  and it will come to an end
[3337.16 --> 3338.50]  you can't come back
[3338.50 --> 3339.50]  the moment you die
[3339.50 --> 3340.44]  you are really gone
[3340.44 --> 3341.66]  death always wins
[3341.66 --> 3342.84]  and the world moves on
[3342.84 --> 3343.42]  without you
[3343.42 --> 3348.86]  now I know
[3348.86 --> 3349.64]  this is really heavy
[3349.64 --> 3352.06]  but Job is simply
[3352.06 --> 3352.86]  stating here
[3352.86 --> 3354.20]  in his grief
[3354.20 --> 3354.78]  right
[3354.78 --> 3355.44]  he has lost
[3355.44 --> 3356.24]  everything
[3356.24 --> 3356.80]  there's death
[3356.80 --> 3357.50]  death is surrounding
[3357.50 --> 3357.92]  him
[3357.92 --> 3359.26]  and he is just
[3359.26 --> 3360.50]  stating
[3360.50 --> 3361.46]  poetically
[3361.46 --> 3362.56]  but objectively
[3362.56 --> 3363.16]  true
[3363.16 --> 3363.92]  he's saying
[3363.92 --> 3364.48]  what is true
[3364.48 --> 3365.04]  of every single
[3365.04 --> 3365.68]  one of us
[3365.68 --> 3367.54]  every single person
[3367.54 --> 3368.38]  who has ever lived
[3368.38 --> 3369.78]  he is saying
[3369.78 --> 3370.36]  you are not
[3370.36 --> 3371.12]  the main character
[3371.12 --> 3371.78]  in the story
[3371.78 --> 3372.60]  you are not
[3372.60 --> 3373.16]  too important
[3373.16 --> 3373.66]  to die
[3373.66 --> 3375.46]  and this is
[3375.46 --> 3376.12]  really hard
[3376.12 --> 3377.00]  for us to accept
[3377.00 --> 3378.38]  and I think
[3378.38 --> 3378.96]  it's especially
[3378.96 --> 3380.04]  hard for this reason
[3380.04 --> 3381.48]  that God
[3381.48 --> 3382.26]  has made us
[3382.26 --> 3383.38]  in his image
[3383.38 --> 3385.16]  God has created
[3385.16 --> 3385.52]  us
[3385.52 --> 3385.74]  right
[3385.74 --> 3386.88]  as the
[3386.88 --> 3387.62]  pinnacle
[3387.62 --> 3388.50]  of his creation
[3388.50 --> 3389.32]  he has endowed
[3389.32 --> 3390.64]  us with dignity
[3390.64 --> 3391.56]  and glory
[3391.56 --> 3392.30]  and honor
[3392.30 --> 3393.86]  as human beings
[3393.86 --> 3395.72]  we see the goodness
[3395.72 --> 3397.30]  of who other people
[3397.30 --> 3397.70]  are
[3397.70 --> 3399.16]  and by God's grace
[3399.16 --> 3400.12]  we can see the goodness
[3400.12 --> 3401.62]  in ourselves
[3401.62 --> 3403.56]  and so we feel
[3403.56 --> 3404.36]  this absurd
[3404.36 --> 3405.44]  contradiction
[3405.44 --> 3406.78]  this is like
[3406.78 --> 3407.94]  the basic question
[3407.94 --> 3408.84]  of all philosophy
[3408.84 --> 3410.32]  this contradiction
[3410.32 --> 3411.80]  between the dignity
[3411.80 --> 3412.96]  that we feel
[3412.96 --> 3413.46]  and know
[3413.46 --> 3414.28]  that we have
[3414.28 --> 3416.30]  and the indignity
[3416.30 --> 3417.96]  and the obscurity
[3417.96 --> 3419.06]  that we face
[3419.06 --> 3419.54]  in death
[3419.54 --> 3420.08]  that seems
[3420.08 --> 3420.68]  to erase
[3420.68 --> 3421.26]  all of that
[3421.26 --> 3424.84]  this is the contradiction
[3424.84 --> 3425.84]  that we see
[3425.84 --> 3426.22]  in the face
[3426.22 --> 3426.66]  of death
[3426.66 --> 3428.96]  the dignity
[3428.96 --> 3429.68]  that we have
[3429.68 --> 3431.88]  the indignity
[3431.88 --> 3432.62]  of death
[3432.62 --> 3434.86]  and in response
[3434.86 --> 3435.16]  right
[3435.16 --> 3435.80]  the response
[3435.80 --> 3436.60]  is the philosophy
[3436.60 --> 3437.24]  in response
[3437.24 --> 3438.34]  to this contradiction
[3438.34 --> 3439.74]  that we all feel
[3439.74 --> 3440.22]  and know
[3440.22 --> 3442.66]  how do we respond
[3442.66 --> 3444.32]  and people can go
[3444.32 --> 3445.22]  in usually
[3445.22 --> 3446.12]  one of two directions
[3446.12 --> 3447.54]  the first response
[3447.54 --> 3447.92]  we have
[3447.92 --> 3448.72]  is one of despair
[3448.72 --> 3450.26]  most of us
[3450.26 --> 3451.28]  don't go for this one
[3451.28 --> 3452.44]  but despair
[3452.44 --> 3453.24]  goes like this
[3453.24 --> 3454.88]  if life inevitably
[3454.88 --> 3455.98]  leads to death
[3455.98 --> 3457.22]  then what's the point
[3457.22 --> 3458.76]  right
[3458.76 --> 3459.46]  if mortals
[3459.46 --> 3460.28]  born of women
[3460.28 --> 3461.18]  are a few days
[3461.18 --> 3461.90]  and full of trouble
[3461.90 --> 3463.04]  then what is the point
[3463.04 --> 3463.42]  of anything
[3463.42 --> 3463.94]  what's the point
[3463.94 --> 3464.38]  of a career
[3464.38 --> 3464.88]  what's the point
[3464.88 --> 3465.46]  of relationships
[3465.46 --> 3467.74]  and we see this response
[3467.74 --> 3468.56]  in the book of Job
[3468.56 --> 3470.96]  in what Job's wife
[3470.96 --> 3471.66]  says to him
[3471.66 --> 3472.22]  famously
[3472.22 --> 3474.34]  to curse God
[3474.34 --> 3474.78]  and die
[3474.78 --> 3476.54]  that's her advice
[3476.54 --> 3477.64]  curse God
[3477.64 --> 3478.04]  and die
[3478.04 --> 3479.06]  that's a
[3479.06 --> 3480.34]  response of despair
[3480.34 --> 3482.48]  but most of us
[3482.48 --> 3483.26]  don't go for that
[3483.26 --> 3483.96]  most of us
[3483.96 --> 3484.54]  go for
[3484.54 --> 3485.38]  the other one
[3485.38 --> 3486.10]  which is denial
[3486.10 --> 3487.32]  denial
[3487.32 --> 3488.26]  goes like this
[3488.26 --> 3489.64]  death may be
[3489.64 --> 3490.46]  real
[3490.46 --> 3492.14]  but I'm going to live
[3492.14 --> 3493.02]  as if it is not
[3493.02 --> 3493.98]  right
[3493.98 --> 3494.56]  I'm going to live
[3494.56 --> 3495.10]  with this kind
[3495.10 --> 3495.98]  of imagined
[3495.98 --> 3496.94]  immortality
[3496.94 --> 3497.50]  I'm going to live
[3497.50 --> 3497.96]  today
[3497.96 --> 3498.94]  this is how I live
[3498.94 --> 3500.36]  like I'm not
[3500.36 --> 3500.84]  I'm not thinking
[3500.84 --> 3501.40]  about my death
[3501.40 --> 3502.00]  I'm just going to live
[3502.00 --> 3502.72]  like I'm going to live
[3502.72 --> 3503.04]  forever
[3503.04 --> 3504.70]  and I don't know
[3504.70 --> 3505.74]  how else to live
[3505.74 --> 3506.64]  everyone else seems
[3506.64 --> 3507.64]  to be doing it that way
[3507.64 --> 3508.90]  so I'm going to do it too
[3508.90 --> 3511.78]  and in my imagined
[3511.78 --> 3512.52]  immortality
[3512.52 --> 3513.46]  I'm going to
[3513.46 --> 3514.92]  make a self
[3514.92 --> 3515.92]  I'm going to construct
[3515.92 --> 3516.52]  an identity
[3516.52 --> 3518.06]  and I will do this
[3518.06 --> 3519.30]  in any number of ways
[3519.30 --> 3520.28]  I might do it
[3520.28 --> 3521.22]  through my career
[3521.22 --> 3522.98]  finding an identity
[3522.98 --> 3524.08]  in what I do
[3524.08 --> 3525.62]  I might do it
[3525.62 --> 3526.86]  through my attractiveness
[3526.86 --> 3528.58]  being seen by others
[3528.58 --> 3529.24]  as beautiful
[3529.24 --> 3529.90]  and desirable
[3529.90 --> 3531.96]  I might find it
[3531.96 --> 3532.72]  in my intelligence
[3532.72 --> 3534.38]  can I be the smartest
[3534.38 --> 3535.36]  person in the room
[3535.36 --> 3537.10]  maybe I'll construct
[3537.10 --> 3537.60]  an identity
[3537.60 --> 3538.12]  from that
[3538.12 --> 3540.24]  maybe I'll find it
[3540.24 --> 3540.66]  in money
[3540.66 --> 3541.56]  having more
[3541.56 --> 3542.38]  than other people
[3542.38 --> 3543.04]  around me
[3543.04 --> 3545.74]  or maybe I'll find
[3545.74 --> 3546.38]  my identity
[3546.38 --> 3547.68]  in my great reputation
[3547.68 --> 3548.06]  right
[3548.06 --> 3549.36]  how I'm perceived
[3549.36 --> 3550.10]  by other people
[3550.10 --> 3551.24]  people see me
[3551.24 --> 3552.16]  as just a kind
[3552.16 --> 3552.64]  person
[3552.64 --> 3553.70]  that's who I am
[3553.70 --> 3555.88]  and so we construct
[3555.88 --> 3557.16]  identities in all kinds
[3557.16 --> 3557.70]  of ways
[3557.70 --> 3559.40]  but the reality
[3559.40 --> 3560.44]  is that every single
[3560.44 --> 3561.88]  one of these identities
[3561.88 --> 3562.94]  that we construct
[3562.94 --> 3563.48]  in our lives
[3563.48 --> 3564.30]  is temporary
[3564.30 --> 3565.80]  they're all going to end
[3565.80 --> 3567.08]  because one day
[3567.08 --> 3567.80]  when we die
[3567.80 --> 3569.26]  all of those things
[3569.26 --> 3569.68]  are gone
[3569.68 --> 3571.46]  right
[3571.46 --> 3572.32]  beauty fades
[3572.32 --> 3573.80]  the next person
[3573.80 --> 3574.60]  takes the job
[3574.60 --> 3575.24]  that you had
[3575.24 --> 3576.76]  all possessions
[3576.76 --> 3577.68]  get left behind
[3577.68 --> 3578.48]  all hope
[3578.48 --> 3579.54]  for growth
[3579.54 --> 3580.20]  and change
[3580.20 --> 3581.18]  comes to an end
[3581.18 --> 3583.96]  and so while many
[3583.96 --> 3584.86]  of us try to live
[3584.86 --> 3586.10]  in denial of death
[3586.10 --> 3586.78]  by searching
[3586.78 --> 3588.04]  for an identity
[3588.04 --> 3589.16]  in this life
[3589.16 --> 3590.24]  we know
[3590.24 --> 3590.98]  somewhere deep
[3590.98 --> 3591.74]  within us
[3591.74 --> 3593.48]  that those identities
[3593.48 --> 3594.20]  are not real
[3594.20 --> 3596.00]  they're like clothes
[3596.00 --> 3596.68]  that we can kind of
[3596.68 --> 3597.22]  take on
[3597.22 --> 3598.28]  and put off
[3598.28 --> 3600.42]  and Job
[3600.42 --> 3602.22]  now is faced
[3602.22 --> 3603.54]  with his own
[3603.54 --> 3604.66]  death
[3604.66 --> 3605.42]  he's surrounded
[3605.42 --> 3606.34]  by death
[3606.34 --> 3607.82]  and how does Job
[3607.82 --> 3608.42]  respond
[3608.42 --> 3609.76]  right
[3609.76 --> 3610.36]  he can listen
[3610.36 --> 3611.10]  to his wife
[3611.10 --> 3611.54]  and give in
[3611.54 --> 3612.08]  to despair
[3612.08 --> 3613.56]  he can try
[3613.56 --> 3614.34]  to deny
[3614.34 --> 3614.78]  death
[3614.78 --> 3615.44]  but in Job's
[3615.44 --> 3615.98]  case
[3615.98 --> 3617.32]  in the book
[3617.32 --> 3617.64]  of Job
[3617.64 --> 3618.06]  that would be
[3618.06 --> 3618.78]  almost impossible
[3618.78 --> 3619.18]  to do
[3619.18 --> 3619.82]  he is so
[3619.82 --> 3620.80]  surrounded by it
[3620.80 --> 3622.74]  or
[3622.74 --> 3624.30]  there's a third
[3624.30 --> 3624.54]  way
[3624.54 --> 3626.06]  he can turn
[3626.06 --> 3626.46]  to God
[3626.46 --> 3627.98]  he can just
[3627.98 --> 3628.82]  turn to God
[3628.82 --> 3629.76]  there's no more
[3629.76 --> 3630.52]  else to turn
[3630.52 --> 3631.86]  he can turn
[3631.86 --> 3632.22]  to God
[3632.22 --> 3632.78]  and that is
[3632.78 --> 3633.62]  what he does
[3633.62 --> 3634.56]  so let me
[3634.56 --> 3635.32]  draw your attention
[3635.32 --> 3637.22]  to verse 13
[3637.22 --> 3638.86]  Job
[3638.86 --> 3639.68]  he's in the midst
[3639.68 --> 3640.50]  of his despair
[3640.50 --> 3641.62]  in the midst
[3641.62 --> 3642.20]  of realizing
[3642.20 --> 3642.82]  he is not
[3642.82 --> 3643.40]  too important
[3643.40 --> 3643.94]  to die
[3643.94 --> 3645.16]  he says this
[3645.16 --> 3645.68]  he's talking
[3645.68 --> 3646.80]  directly to God
[3646.80 --> 3647.88]  and he says
[3647.88 --> 3649.34]  if only you
[3649.34 --> 3649.86]  God
[3649.86 --> 3650.78]  would hide me
[3650.78 --> 3651.48]  in the grave
[3651.48 --> 3652.46]  conceal me
[3652.46 --> 3653.10]  to your anger
[3653.10 --> 3653.82]  has passed
[3653.82 --> 3654.96]  if only you
[3654.96 --> 3655.44]  would set
[3655.44 --> 3656.20]  a time
[3656.20 --> 3657.94]  then remember
[3657.94 --> 3658.34]  me
[3658.34 --> 3660.68]  remember me
[3660.68 --> 3661.06]  God
[3661.06 --> 3662.44]  he says
[3662.44 --> 3663.64]  and then in
[3663.64 --> 3664.40]  verse 14
[3664.40 --> 3665.16]  Job asks
[3665.16 --> 3666.12]  this haunting
[3666.12 --> 3666.68]  question
[3666.68 --> 3667.78]  if someone
[3667.78 --> 3668.44]  dies
[3668.44 --> 3669.48]  will they
[3669.48 --> 3670.04]  live again
[3670.04 --> 3674.96]  and that
[3674.96 --> 3675.76]  question
[3675.76 --> 3677.24]  kind of
[3677.24 --> 3677.80]  just hangs
[3677.80 --> 3678.40]  in the air
[3678.40 --> 3679.32]  okay
[3679.32 --> 3679.72]  it hangs
[3679.72 --> 3680.26]  in the air
[3680.26 --> 3681.40]  it hangs
[3681.40 --> 3681.94]  there throughout
[3681.94 --> 3682.52]  the story
[3682.52 --> 3683.02]  of scripture
[3683.02 --> 3684.94]  it hangs
[3684.94 --> 3685.30]  there
[3685.30 --> 3686.04]  year
[3686.04 --> 3686.94]  after year
[3686.94 --> 3688.06]  century
[3688.06 --> 3688.88]  after century
[3688.88 --> 3689.28]  we don't
[3689.28 --> 3689.80]  really know
[3689.80 --> 3690.28]  entirely
[3690.28 --> 3690.72]  when the
[3690.72 --> 3691.00]  book of
[3691.00 --> 3691.14]  Job
[3691.14 --> 3691.52]  was written
[3691.52 --> 3692.12]  but it
[3692.12 --> 3692.58]  just hangs
[3692.58 --> 3692.84]  there
[3692.84 --> 3693.34]  and hangs
[3693.34 --> 3693.56]  there
[3693.56 --> 3694.46]  and hangs
[3694.46 --> 3694.66]  there
[3694.66 --> 3695.10]  if someone
[3695.10 --> 3695.48]  dies
[3695.48 --> 3695.90]  will they
[3695.90 --> 3696.28]  live
[3696.28 --> 3697.18]  and it
[3697.18 --> 3697.46]  hangs
[3697.46 --> 3697.84]  there
[3697.84 --> 3699.18]  until
[3699.18 --> 3700.00]  somebody
[3700.00 --> 3700.34]  comes
[3700.34 --> 3700.76]  along
[3700.76 --> 3701.60]  and answers
[3701.60 --> 3702.16]  the question
[3702.16 --> 3704.72]  so in
[3704.72 --> 3705.14]  John
[3705.14 --> 3706.16]  chapter 11
[3706.16 --> 3707.98]  Jesus
[3707.98 --> 3708.46]  answers
[3708.46 --> 3709.00]  the question
[3709.00 --> 3710.72]  he says
[3710.72 --> 3711.14]  this
[3711.14 --> 3712.84]  I am
[3712.84 --> 3713.56]  the resurrection
[3713.56 --> 3714.38]  and the life
[3714.38 --> 3715.60]  the one
[3715.60 --> 3716.52]  who believes
[3716.52 --> 3717.28]  in me
[3717.28 --> 3718.48]  will live
[3718.48 --> 3719.68]  even though
[3719.68 --> 3721.02]  they die
[3721.02 --> 3723.90]  right
[3723.90 --> 3724.62]  that's incredible
[3724.62 --> 3725.28]  that is the
[3725.28 --> 3725.70]  answer
[3725.70 --> 3725.72]  answer
[3725.72 --> 3726.94]  to the question
[3726.94 --> 3727.42]  if you're
[3727.42 --> 3728.04]  feeling the
[3728.04 --> 3728.44]  question
[3728.44 --> 3728.82]  which has
[3728.82 --> 3729.14]  been my
[3729.14 --> 3729.52]  goal
[3729.52 --> 3731.70]  then this
[3731.70 --> 3732.20]  answer
[3732.20 --> 3733.68]  is amazing
[3733.68 --> 3736.18]  now why
[3736.18 --> 3736.60]  is this
[3736.60 --> 3737.18]  true
[3737.18 --> 3739.86]  it is true
[3739.86 --> 3740.64]  is it just
[3740.64 --> 3741.10]  true because
[3741.10 --> 3741.80]  Jesus claims
[3741.80 --> 3742.02]  it
[3742.02 --> 3743.22]  no
[3743.22 --> 3744.78]  it's true
[3744.78 --> 3745.20]  here's why
[3745.20 --> 3745.54]  it's true
[3745.54 --> 3746.18]  because in
[3746.18 --> 3746.84]  his death
[3746.84 --> 3747.46]  on the cross
[3747.46 --> 3748.24]  Jesus died
[3748.24 --> 3748.52]  too
[3748.52 --> 3748.92]  just like
[3748.92 --> 3749.70]  the other
[3749.70 --> 3750.62]  hundred plus
[3750.62 --> 3751.30]  billion people
[3751.30 --> 3751.92]  have ever lived
[3751.92 --> 3752.78]  Jesus also
[3752.78 --> 3753.18]  died
[3753.18 --> 3754.20]  but he
[3754.20 --> 3754.74]  conquered
[3754.74 --> 3755.26]  death
[3755.26 --> 3756.76]  and Jesus
[3756.76 --> 3757.70]  proved that he
[3757.70 --> 3758.42]  conquered death
[3758.42 --> 3759.28]  by rising
[3759.28 --> 3759.88]  again
[3759.88 --> 3762.18]  the one
[3762.18 --> 3763.62]  case in all
[3763.62 --> 3764.02]  of human
[3764.02 --> 3764.44]  history
[3764.44 --> 3765.48]  where death
[3765.48 --> 3766.52]  did not
[3766.52 --> 3766.88]  win
[3766.88 --> 3768.76]  Jesus put
[3768.76 --> 3770.02]  his sword
[3770.02 --> 3771.24]  through death
[3771.24 --> 3772.08]  and has been
[3772.08 --> 3772.46]  conquered
[3772.46 --> 3774.50]  and so
[3774.50 --> 3775.18]  what does that
[3775.18 --> 3775.56]  mean that
[3775.56 --> 3776.00]  means that
[3776.00 --> 3776.76]  Jesus has
[3776.76 --> 3777.70]  within himself
[3777.70 --> 3778.94]  a personal
[3778.94 --> 3779.48]  identity
[3779.48 --> 3780.96]  that is
[3780.96 --> 3782.06]  death proof
[3782.06 --> 3783.26]  that is
[3783.26 --> 3783.80]  death proof
[3783.80 --> 3785.24]  he has a
[3785.24 --> 3786.28]  personal identity
[3786.28 --> 3787.24]  that has
[3787.24 --> 3788.46]  survived death
[3788.46 --> 3789.90]  that hasn't
[3789.90 --> 3790.78]  gone away
[3790.78 --> 3791.40]  that hasn't
[3791.40 --> 3791.74]  ended
[3791.74 --> 3794.42]  and he has
[3794.42 --> 3795.12]  this identity
[3795.12 --> 3796.50]  and he extends
[3796.50 --> 3796.96]  it
[3796.96 --> 3798.58]  an invitation
[3798.58 --> 3800.36]  to you
[3800.36 --> 3801.52]  to come
[3801.52 --> 3802.22]  and share
[3802.22 --> 3803.32]  that identity
[3803.32 --> 3803.84]  with him
[3803.84 --> 3805.72]  he says
[3805.72 --> 3807.02]  this is this
[3807.02 --> 3807.48]  death proof
[3807.48 --> 3808.00]  identity
[3808.00 --> 3809.20]  you can
[3809.20 --> 3809.94]  have this
[3809.94 --> 3812.26]  and that's
[3812.26 --> 3812.76]  what faith
[3812.76 --> 3813.20]  in Jesus
[3813.20 --> 3813.68]  is
[3813.68 --> 3814.28]  that's what
[3814.28 --> 3814.66]  faith is
[3814.66 --> 3815.08]  faith in
[3815.08 --> 3815.38]  Jesus
[3815.38 --> 3816.14]  which is
[3816.14 --> 3816.70]  embodied
[3816.70 --> 3817.04]  in our
[3817.04 --> 3817.46]  baptism
[3817.46 --> 3817.92]  in the name
[3817.92 --> 3818.14]  of the
[3818.14 --> 3818.34]  Father
[3818.34 --> 3818.58]  Son
[3818.58 --> 3818.88]  and Holy
[3818.88 --> 3819.22]  Spirit
[3819.22 --> 3820.80]  it wields
[3820.80 --> 3821.16]  you to
[3821.16 --> 3821.62]  Jesus
[3821.62 --> 3821.92]  right
[3821.92 --> 3822.24]  like
[3822.24 --> 3822.82]  like two
[3822.82 --> 3823.34]  pieces of
[3823.34 --> 3823.66]  metal
[3823.66 --> 3824.80]  wielded
[3824.80 --> 3825.34]  together
[3825.34 --> 3827.04]  until
[3827.04 --> 3827.80]  they are
[3827.80 --> 3828.30]  one
[3828.30 --> 3830.14]  you are
[3830.14 --> 3830.86]  united
[3830.86 --> 3831.74]  to Jesus
[3831.74 --> 3832.48]  by faith
[3832.48 --> 3833.30]  and you
[3833.30 --> 3834.10]  take on
[3834.10 --> 3835.34]  his identity
[3835.34 --> 3835.92]  an identity
[3835.92 --> 3836.38]  that is
[3836.38 --> 3836.90]  death proof
[3836.90 --> 3838.54]  and therefore
[3838.54 --> 3839.00]  when Jesus
[3839.00 --> 3839.64]  says I
[3839.64 --> 3840.12]  am the
[3840.12 --> 3840.60]  resurrection
[3840.60 --> 3840.96]  and the
[3840.96 --> 3841.20]  life
[3841.20 --> 3841.42]  whoever
[3841.42 --> 3841.80]  believes
[3841.80 --> 3842.16]  in me
[3842.16 --> 3842.94]  though he
[3842.94 --> 3843.24]  die
[3843.24 --> 3843.86]  yet shall
[3843.86 --> 3844.38]  he live
[3844.38 --> 3845.74]  that becomes
[3845.74 --> 3846.70]  true
[3846.70 --> 3848.18]  for you
[3848.18 --> 3849.92]  it's not
[3849.92 --> 3850.32]  just true
[3850.32 --> 3851.54]  for anybody
[3851.54 --> 3853.26]  but it's
[3853.26 --> 3853.82]  true for
[3853.82 --> 3854.62]  anybody
[3854.62 --> 3855.24]  anyone
[3855.24 --> 3856.94]  whose identity
[3856.94 --> 3858.22]  is wielded
[3858.22 --> 3858.96]  welded
[3858.96 --> 3859.42]  sorry
[3859.42 --> 3859.90]  welded
[3859.90 --> 3861.48]  to the identity
[3861.48 --> 3861.92]  of Jesus
[3861.92 --> 3862.56]  through faith
[3862.56 --> 3863.52]  right
[3863.52 --> 3864.16]  through trusting
[3864.16 --> 3864.72]  his life
[3864.72 --> 3865.06]  death and
[3865.06 --> 3865.36]  resurrection
[3865.36 --> 3865.50]  resurrection
[3865.50 --> 3865.98]  for them
[3865.98 --> 3868.42]  so Job's
[3868.42 --> 3868.76]  question
[3868.76 --> 3869.50]  if anyone
[3869.50 --> 3870.08]  dies
[3870.08 --> 3870.98]  will they
[3870.98 --> 3871.74]  live again
[3871.74 --> 3872.84]  the answer
[3872.84 --> 3873.34]  is
[3873.34 --> 3874.62]  yes
[3874.62 --> 3876.22]  yes
[3876.22 --> 3876.80]  in Jesus
[3876.80 --> 3877.32]  Christ
[3877.32 --> 3878.28]  we can
[3878.28 --> 3878.84]  live again
[3878.84 --> 3879.92]  death
[3879.92 --> 3880.26]  has been
[3880.26 --> 3880.68]  defeated
[3880.68 --> 3882.90]  in the case
[3882.90 --> 3883.34]  of Jesus
[3883.34 --> 3883.82]  death
[3883.82 --> 3884.32]  did not
[3884.32 --> 3884.56]  win
[3884.56 --> 3886.40]  and now
[3886.40 --> 3886.68]  what does
[3886.68 --> 3887.10]  this give
[3887.10 --> 3887.40]  you
[3887.40 --> 3888.24]  friends
[3888.24 --> 3888.72]  it gives
[3888.72 --> 3889.12]  you an
[3889.12 --> 3889.66]  identity
[3889.66 --> 3890.10]  that has
[3890.10 --> 3890.52]  conquered
[3890.52 --> 3890.96]  death
[3890.96 --> 3891.98]  right
[3891.98 --> 3892.46]  if your
[3892.46 --> 3892.90]  identity
[3892.90 --> 3893.38]  is in
[3893.38 --> 3893.68]  Jesus
[3893.68 --> 3894.04]  Christ
[3894.04 --> 3894.46]  it means
[3894.46 --> 3894.78]  that
[3894.78 --> 3895.32]  that
[3895.32 --> 3895.80]  identity
[3895.80 --> 3896.74]  you have
[3896.74 --> 3897.38]  an
[3897.38 --> 3898.08]  eternal
[3898.08 --> 3899.10]  identity
[3899.10 --> 3900.62]  right
[3900.62 --> 3901.00]  and so
[3901.00 --> 3901.32]  it also
[3901.32 --> 3901.52]  means
[3901.52 --> 3901.80]  that all
[3901.80 --> 3901.98]  those
[3901.98 --> 3902.38]  other
[3902.38 --> 3903.04]  identities
[3903.04 --> 3903.56]  that we
[3903.56 --> 3903.88]  kind of
[3903.88 --> 3904.26]  struggle
[3904.26 --> 3904.96]  to construct
[3904.96 --> 3905.30]  for
[3905.30 --> 3905.74]  ourselves
[3905.74 --> 3906.02]  throughout
[3906.02 --> 3906.58]  our lives
[3906.58 --> 3908.30]  in Christ
[3908.30 --> 3908.80]  we have
[3908.80 --> 3909.38]  an identity
[3909.38 --> 3909.88]  that is
[3909.88 --> 3910.60]  not temporary
[3910.60 --> 3911.18]  like all
[3911.18 --> 3911.46]  those
[3911.46 --> 3911.78]  but that
[3911.78 --> 3912.14]  will last
[3912.14 --> 3912.46]  forever
[3912.46 --> 3914.64]  and so
[3914.64 --> 3914.96]  also
[3914.96 --> 3915.38]  here's
[3915.38 --> 3915.68]  the good
[3915.68 --> 3916.02]  news
[3916.02 --> 3918.06]  you know
[3918.06 --> 3918.56]  and this
[3918.56 --> 3919.24]  this says
[3919.24 --> 3919.50]  something
[3919.50 --> 3919.98]  that's so
[3919.98 --> 3920.50]  comforting
[3920.50 --> 3921.58]  and that
[3921.58 --> 3921.92]  we so
[3921.92 --> 3922.34]  desperately
[3922.34 --> 3922.76]  need to
[3922.76 --> 3923.02]  hear
[3923.02 --> 3924.36]  it says
[3924.36 --> 3924.72]  to us
[3924.72 --> 3925.04]  that the
[3925.04 --> 3925.34]  goodness
[3925.34 --> 3925.86]  and the
[3925.86 --> 3926.22]  dignity
[3926.22 --> 3927.14]  that we
[3927.14 --> 3927.68]  see
[3927.68 --> 3929.10]  often in
[3929.10 --> 3929.66]  other people
[3929.66 --> 3930.02]  sometimes
[3930.02 --> 3930.52]  also in
[3930.52 --> 3931.00]  ourselves
[3931.00 --> 3932.44]  that uniqueness
[3932.44 --> 3932.98]  that each
[3932.98 --> 3933.54]  one of us
[3933.54 --> 3934.14]  brings to
[3934.14 --> 3934.70]  the world
[3934.70 --> 3936.36]  the uniqueness
[3936.36 --> 3937.98]  that people
[3937.98 --> 3938.54]  have
[3938.54 --> 3938.98]  that we
[3938.98 --> 3939.70]  miss so
[3939.70 --> 3940.06]  much
[3940.06 --> 3940.56]  when someone
[3940.56 --> 3941.04]  dies
[3941.04 --> 3942.68]  God says
[3942.68 --> 3945.54]  he values
[3945.54 --> 3946.30]  that identity
[3946.30 --> 3948.12]  just as much
[3948.12 --> 3948.48]  as we
[3948.48 --> 3949.12]  value
[3949.12 --> 3950.08]  the identities
[3950.08 --> 3950.54]  of people
[3950.54 --> 3950.92]  that we
[3950.92 --> 3951.22]  love
[3951.22 --> 3951.64]  who they
[3951.64 --> 3951.86]  are
[3951.86 --> 3952.24]  God
[3952.24 --> 3952.84]  values
[3952.84 --> 3953.40]  that too
[3953.40 --> 3954.60]  and it
[3954.60 --> 3955.30]  says that
[3955.30 --> 3956.38]  you are
[3956.38 --> 3956.92]  not too
[3956.92 --> 3957.34]  important
[3957.34 --> 3958.18]  to die
[3958.18 --> 3959.08]  but you
[3959.08 --> 3959.62]  are too
[3959.62 --> 3959.98]  important
[3959.98 --> 3960.42]  to stay
[3960.42 --> 3960.70]  dead
[3960.70 --> 3962.26]  it says
[3962.26 --> 3962.70]  that God
[3962.70 --> 3963.08]  is not
[3963.08 --> 3963.36]  willing
[3963.36 --> 3963.84]  to lose
[3963.84 --> 3964.06]  you
[3964.06 --> 3966.06]  now God
[3966.06 --> 3966.54]  is willing
[3966.54 --> 3967.16]  to lose
[3967.16 --> 3967.72]  like all
[3967.72 --> 3968.14]  of those
[3968.14 --> 3968.78]  silly
[3968.78 --> 3969.26]  identities
[3969.26 --> 3969.76]  that we
[3969.76 --> 3970.08]  kind of
[3970.08 --> 3970.66]  put on
[3970.66 --> 3971.36]  to ourselves
[3971.36 --> 3973.02]  trying to
[3973.02 --> 3974.60]  construct an
[3974.60 --> 3974.98]  identity
[3974.98 --> 3975.58]  through our
[3975.58 --> 3976.24]  wealth
[3976.24 --> 3976.50]  our
[3976.50 --> 3977.20]  intelligence
[3977.20 --> 3977.84]  our beauty
[3977.84 --> 3978.34]  all these
[3978.34 --> 3978.78]  things
[3978.78 --> 3979.96]  all those
[3979.96 --> 3980.38]  things will
[3980.38 --> 3980.68]  die
[3980.68 --> 3982.84]  and they
[3982.84 --> 3983.26]  will stay
[3983.26 --> 3983.58]  dead
[3983.58 --> 3985.04]  and that's
[3985.04 --> 3985.42]  not a bad
[3985.42 --> 3985.72]  thing
[3985.72 --> 3987.34]  but there
[3987.34 --> 3987.80]  is a
[3987.80 --> 3988.34]  true
[3988.34 --> 3989.58]  you
[3989.58 --> 3990.94]  a you
[3990.94 --> 3991.48]  that God
[3991.48 --> 3992.18]  has made
[3992.18 --> 3992.72]  that is
[3992.72 --> 3993.26]  unique
[3993.26 --> 3995.68]  and that
[3995.68 --> 3996.20]  you
[3996.20 --> 3996.68]  through
[3996.68 --> 3997.28]  faith
[3997.28 --> 3998.72]  is welded
[3998.72 --> 3999.04]  to the
[3999.04 --> 3999.36]  identity
[3999.36 --> 3999.96]  of Jesus
[3999.96 --> 4001.42]  and that
[4001.42 --> 4002.02]  is the
[4002.02 --> 4002.24]  you
[4002.24 --> 4002.78]  the true
[4002.78 --> 4003.10]  you
[4003.10 --> 4003.66]  that God
[4003.66 --> 4004.08]  knows
[4004.08 --> 4004.36]  and that
[4004.36 --> 4004.56]  God
[4004.56 --> 4004.86]  made
[4004.86 --> 4005.40]  that is
[4005.40 --> 4005.68]  the you
[4005.68 --> 4006.02]  that will
[4006.02 --> 4006.50]  not die
[4006.50 --> 4008.38]  and that
[4008.38 --> 4008.90]  is the you
[4008.90 --> 4009.36]  that is now
[4009.36 --> 4010.28]  death proof
[4010.28 --> 4011.16]  through faith
[4011.16 --> 4011.56]  in Jesus
[4011.56 --> 4012.42]  and that
[4012.42 --> 4012.92]  will one
[4012.92 --> 4013.40]  day be
[4013.40 --> 4014.06]  resurrected
[4014.06 --> 4014.94]  on the
[4014.94 --> 4015.46]  other side
[4015.46 --> 4017.42]  right
[4017.42 --> 4017.80]  friends
[4017.80 --> 4018.26]  death
[4018.26 --> 4018.96]  tells you
[4018.96 --> 4019.52]  you are
[4019.52 --> 4019.96]  not too
[4019.96 --> 4020.28]  important
[4020.28 --> 4020.80]  to die
[4020.80 --> 4021.52]  you are
[4021.52 --> 4022.00]  not the
[4022.00 --> 4022.24]  center
[4022.24 --> 4022.54]  of the
[4022.54 --> 4022.92]  story
[4022.92 --> 4023.80]  but the
[4023.80 --> 4024.14]  gospel
[4024.14 --> 4024.74]  tells you
[4024.74 --> 4025.60]  that you
[4025.60 --> 4026.40]  can receive
[4026.40 --> 4027.06]  an eternal
[4027.06 --> 4027.84]  identity
[4027.84 --> 4029.22]  in Jesus
[4029.22 --> 4030.62]  and friends
[4030.62 --> 4031.04]  in the face
[4031.04 --> 4031.42]  of death
[4031.42 --> 4031.94]  that is
[4031.94 --> 4032.30]  our great
[4032.30 --> 4032.60]  hope
[4032.60 --> 4034.42]  so let's
[4034.42 --> 4035.00]  pray together
[4035.00 --> 4039.28]  our heavenly
[4039.28 --> 4039.94]  father we
[4039.94 --> 4041.08]  know that
[4041.08 --> 4041.86]  we need
[4041.86 --> 4042.74]  an identity
[4042.74 --> 4043.18]  that is
[4043.18 --> 4043.84]  unshakable
[4043.84 --> 4045.10]  that will
[4045.10 --> 4045.96]  last longer
[4045.96 --> 4046.66]  than death
[4046.66 --> 4048.16]  and we
[4048.16 --> 4048.66]  can only
[4048.66 --> 4049.04]  get it
[4049.04 --> 4049.50]  from you
[4049.50 --> 4050.82]  would you
[4050.82 --> 4051.44]  please open
[4051.44 --> 4051.78]  up our
[4051.78 --> 4052.22]  hearts
[4052.22 --> 4052.48]  and our
[4052.48 --> 4052.98]  minds
[4052.98 --> 4054.18]  to receive
[4054.18 --> 4054.58]  it from
[4054.58 --> 4055.02]  you Jesus
[4055.02 --> 4055.62]  to turn
[4055.62 --> 4056.06]  to you
[4056.06 --> 4056.66]  in faith
[4056.66 --> 4057.92]  so that
[4057.92 --> 4058.44]  even though
[4058.44 --> 4058.94]  we may
[4058.94 --> 4059.62]  die yet
[4059.62 --> 4060.96]  we shall
[4060.96 --> 4061.32]  live
[4061.32 --> 4063.02]  we thank
[4063.02 --> 4063.40]  you Lord
[4063.40 --> 4063.86]  for this
[4063.86 --> 4064.80]  great gift
[4064.80 --> 4065.20]  we thank
[4065.20 --> 4065.40]  you for
[4065.40 --> 4066.08]  the answer
[4066.08 --> 4066.42]  of the
[4066.42 --> 4066.80]  gospel
[4066.80 --> 4068.44]  to the
[4068.44 --> 4068.86]  problem
[4068.86 --> 4069.24]  that we
[4069.24 --> 4069.86]  all face
[4069.86 --> 4070.26]  even when
[4070.26 --> 4070.54]  we try
[4070.54 --> 4070.94]  to ignore
[4070.94 --> 4071.14]  it
[4071.14 --> 4071.76]  the problem
[4071.76 --> 4072.06]  of our
[4072.06 --> 4072.38]  death
[4072.38 --> 4073.38]  Lord we
[4073.38 --> 4073.78]  thank you
[4073.78 --> 4074.30]  that Jesus
[4074.30 --> 4075.78]  rose again
[4075.78 --> 4078.60]  and Lord
[4078.60 --> 4079.22]  give us
[4079.22 --> 4079.66]  the hope
[4079.66 --> 4080.16]  and the joy
[4080.16 --> 4080.78]  and the comfort
[4080.78 --> 4081.42]  of knowing
[4081.42 --> 4081.70]  that
[4081.70 --> 4083.10]  we pray
[4083.10 --> 4083.46]  in Jesus
[4083.46 --> 4083.84]  name
[4083.84 --> 4084.40]  amen
[4084.40 --> 4087.12]  so let's
[4087.12 --> 4087.88]  stand and
[4087.88 --> 4088.46]  we will sing
[4088.46 --> 4089.06]  our song of
[4089.06 --> 4089.76]  response in
[4089.76 --> 4090.80]  Christ alone
[4090.80 --> 4091.84]  in Christ alone
[4091.84 --> 4092.42]  so let's
[4092.42 --> 4092.82]  stand and
[4092.82 --> 4093.02]  sing
[4111.70 --> 4118.34]  hear Christ alone
[4118.34 --> 4121.36]  my hope is found
[4121.36 --> 4123.20]  he is my life
[4123.20 --> 4124.84]  my strength
[4124.84 --> 4126.26]  my song
[4126.26 --> 4128.84]  this corned stone
[4128.84 --> 4131.64]  this solid ground
[4131.64 --> 4133.70]  heard to the fiercest
[4133.70 --> 4145.66]  love Geb elite
[4145.66 --> 4156.92]  My comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[4159.22 --> 4168.96]  In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless pain.
[4168.96 --> 4178.82]  His gifts were love and righteousness, born by the ones He came to save.
[4179.32 --> 4188.62]  To all that God said, Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[4188.62 --> 4194.46]  For every sin on Him was laid.
[4194.46 --> 4199.46]  Here in the death of Christ I live.
[4202.10 --> 4212.20]  Here in the ground His body lay, light of the world by darkness slain.
[4212.20 --> 4222.02]  Then bursting forth the glorious day, and from the grave He rose again.
[4222.02 --> 4231.02]  And as He stands in victory, since Christ has lost its glory.
[4231.02 --> 4242.02]  For I wish that He is mine, Father, the precious Father of Christ.
[4242.02 --> 4244.02]  Here in the death of Christ.
[4244.02 --> 4249.02]  Here in the death of Christ.
[4249.02 --> 4256.02]  Here in the death of Christ.
[4256.02 --> 4257.02]  Here in the death of Christ.
[4257.02 --> 4258.02]  Here in the death of Christ.
[4258.02 --> 4263.44]  This is the power of Christ in me.
[4263.44 --> 4267.72]  For life's Jesus Christ in the final breath.
[4267.72 --> 4270.66]  Jesus commands my death to free.
[4270.66 --> 4276.00]  No part of heaven will seem again
[4276.00 --> 4281.00]  And ever part me from his head
[4281.00 --> 4286.20]  Till he returns or calls me home
[4286.20 --> 4291.32]  Here in the power of God I'll stand
[4300.66 --> 4312.92]  As mentioned earlier, the offering this morning is for denominational shares. The deacons will come forward now.
[4330.66 --> 4360.64]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4360.66 --> 4390.64]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4390.66 --> 4420.64]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4420.64 --> 4450.62]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4450.62 --> 4480.60]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4480.62 --> 4482.62]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4482.62 --> 4512.62] 
[4512.62 --> 4542.62] 
[4542.62 --> 4544.62]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4544.62 --> 4546.62]  The deacons will come forward now.
[4546.62 --> 4568.54]  And heavenly father, guide the people of this land and of all nations in the ways of justice and in the ways of peace according to your truth, that we may honor and serve one another as fellow image bearers.
[4568.54 --> 4570.54]  And Lord, give us all of the deacons.
[4570.54 --> 4589.12]  And Lord, give us all of reverence for the earth as your creation, that we may steward it rightly and use its resources in the service of others into your honor and to your glory.
[4589.12 --> 4597.12]  Lord, we pray for the Lord.
[4597.12 --> 4601.90]  Lord, we pray for your blessing upon all those whose lives are closely connected with our own.
[4601.90 --> 4608.90]  Help us to serve them, Lord, help us to serve them, just as you have served us.
[4608.90 --> 4628.90]  Lord, comfort and heal all those who suffer in body, in mind, or in spirit.
[4628.90 --> 4631.90]  And give them courage and hope in their troubles.
[4631.90 --> 4634.90]  And bring them the joy of your salvation.
[4634.90 --> 4643.04]  We pray especially this morning for a Sifuwe, who has struggled with some health issues for a couple weeks now.
[4643.04 --> 4649.64]  And Lord, we also lift up others to you who need your healing.
[4649.64 --> 4668.52]  Father, we lift up to you also particularly Salam, the wife of Kukuya, who is scheduled to give birth to their fourth child next Sunday at Richmond Hospital.
[4669.30 --> 4674.08]  Lord, would you protect her delivery, and Lord, would you be with her family.
[4679.64 --> 4688.38]  And Holy Spirit, we ask that you, the Comforter, would comfort all who mourn, who mourn the death of a loved one.
[4688.96 --> 4694.12]  And we pray that we may share with all of your saints in your eternal kingdom.
[4701.68 --> 4709.24]  God of truth, help us to keep your law of love and to walk in the ways of wisdom and righteousness that you teach us.
[4709.64 --> 4714.08]  That we might find true life in Jesus Christ, your Son.
[4721.32 --> 4727.94]  O God, our King, by the resurrection of your Son, Jesus Christ, you conquered sin.
[4728.48 --> 4733.54]  You put death to flight and gave us the hope of everlasting life.
[4734.14 --> 4737.64]  Lord, redeem all our days by this victory.
[4737.64 --> 4739.82]  Forgive our sins.
[4740.26 --> 4741.46]  Banish our fears.
[4742.02 --> 4745.22]  Make us bold to praise you and to do your will.
[4746.08 --> 4750.78]  Strengthen us to wait for the consummation of your kingdom on that last great day.
[4750.78 --> 4762.16]  And we pray all of these things as well, also, as the Lord Jesus taught us, saying together in the Lord's Prayer.
[4762.16 --> 4767.18]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4767.68 --> 4772.62]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4773.30 --> 4775.60]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[4776.14 --> 4781.32]  And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4781.64 --> 4786.04]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4786.04 --> 4792.08]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4792.58 --> 4793.02]  Amen.
[4793.02 --> 4799.82]  Let's stand and we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us and with his praises on our lips.
[4800.62 --> 4806.60]  And right after the service again, please join us for a time of fellowship in the coffee, the coffee hall, the fellowship hall.
[4807.44 --> 4809.82]  And now lift up your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4810.48 --> 4818.78]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with each one of you now and forever.
[4819.16 --> 4819.52]  Amen.
[4819.52 --> 4819.62]  Amen.
[4819.62 --> 4819.66]  Amen.
[4819.66 --> 4819.68]  Amen.
[4823.02 --> 4846.72]  Praise the Lord.
[4846.72 --> 4850.66]  Come, whom all blessings flow.
[4850.66 --> 4860.66]  He has washed and made me white as snow.
[4860.66 --> 4870.82]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[4870.82 --> 4875.16]  Now and forever.
[4876.36 --> 4879.36]  Praise the Holy Spirit.
[4880.66 --> 4883.82]  Praise the Lord.
[4883.82 --> 4884.88]  Thank you.

[4893.82 --> 4901.90]  Praise the Holy Spirit.
[4901.90 --> 4905.10]  Praise the Lord.
[4905.10 --> 4910.56]  From whom all blessings flow
[4910.56 --> 4919.88]  He has washed and made me want a snow
[4919.88 --> 4930.16]  I redeemed from all I said and slain
[4930.16 --> 4934.48]  Now and forever
[4934.48 --> 4940.54]  Praise His holy name
[4940.54 --> 4945.54]  Praise His holy name
[4945.54 --> 4950.60]  Praise His holy name
[4950.60 --> 4953.58]  To God in the glory
[4953.58 --> 4956.00]  Now and forever
[4956.00 --> 4960.14]  Praise His holy name
[4960.16 --> 4964.16]  To God in the glory
[4964.16 --> 4966.98]  Now and forever
[4966.98 --> 4971.16]  Praise His holy name
[4971.16 --> 4978.16]  Now and forever
[4978.16 --> 4985.16]  Now and forever
[4985.16 --> 4989.16]  Now and forever
