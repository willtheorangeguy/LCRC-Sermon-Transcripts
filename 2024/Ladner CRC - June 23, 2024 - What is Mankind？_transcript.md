[0.00 --> 29.98]  We'll be right back.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 302.00]  Amen.
[302.00 --> 303.00]  Amen.
[303.00 --> 304.00]  Good morning to you all.
[304.00 --> 305.00]  Good morning.
[305.00 --> 309.00]  Welcome to Worship This Morning at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[309.00 --> 314.00]  And we are here this morning, we are gathered together to worship the one true and living
[314.00 --> 315.00]  God.
[315.00 --> 321.00]  You know, the God we worship is great and he is greatly to be praised.
[321.00 --> 326.00]  I know, I'm sure many of you have had the experience of being out, outside of the city
[326.00 --> 331.00]  and being able to look up and see the stars in the sky, right?
[331.00 --> 334.00]  The, you know, millions of stars.
[334.00 --> 339.00]  Or we see the beauty of the mountains around us, the beauty of the ocean.
[339.00 --> 341.00]  And we are amazed by these things.
[341.00 --> 347.00]  And yet the one we worship today is the God who created all of that.
[347.00 --> 354.00]  And he is bigger and more beautiful and more majestic than anything that we see in creation.
[354.00 --> 359.00]  And also, he is the one who cares for us.
[359.00 --> 365.00]  And so our call to worship this morning comes from the Psalms, Psalm 113, Psalm 57.
[365.00 --> 369.00]  And let's read the scriptures together and let's read it responsively.
[369.00 --> 373.00]  So I'll begin and then I'll ask you to read out loud as well.
[373.00 --> 379.00]  Praise the Lord, you his servants.
[379.00 --> 382.00]  Praise the name of the Lord.
[382.00 --> 388.00]  Let the name of the Lord be praised both now and forevermore.
[388.00 --> 395.00]  From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[395.00 --> 402.00]  The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.
[402.00 --> 412.00]  Who is like the Lord our God, the one who sits enthroned on high, who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth.
[412.00 --> 419.00]  He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap.
[419.00 --> 423.00]  Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[423.00 --> 426.00]  Let your glory be over all the earth.
[426.00 --> 427.00]  Let's pray together.
[427.00 --> 433.00]  Triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[433.00 --> 438.00]  How majestic is your name in all the earth.
[438.00 --> 448.00]  Lord, from the rising of the sun across the heavens to the place where it sets, over the whole earth, Lord, you reign in majesty.
[448.00 --> 449.00]  You rule in justice.
[449.00 --> 451.00]  You are the holy God.
[451.00 --> 453.00]  And so we praise you, Lord.
[453.00 --> 460.00]  All the peoples of the nations praise you in different languages and in different places and in different styles.
[460.00 --> 465.00]  And in different ways, Lord, you created us to worship you.
[465.00 --> 470.00]  Lord, and we thank you that even though you are so majestic, yet you look upon us.
[470.00 --> 473.00]  You lift up the poor from the dust.
[473.00 --> 475.00]  You care about the needy.
[475.00 --> 482.00]  And Lord, you come through our Lord Jesus Christ to establish your kingdom rule.
[482.00 --> 487.00]  Your kingdom, which is renewing and will finally renew all things.
[487.00 --> 497.00]  And so, Lord, we praise you this morning and we ask that you would help us this morning to see, to taste a bit more of your glory this morning.
[497.00 --> 500.00]  That we would come and that we would commune with you.
[500.00 --> 503.00]  That our hearts would be lifted up to worship you.
[503.00 --> 512.00]  And that you would meet us, each one of us, where we are, whatever is going on in our hearts and in our lives, so that we could worship you.
[512.00 --> 515.00]  And we do that in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[515.00 --> 516.00]  Amen.
[516.00 --> 521.00]  So let's all stand together as we receive God's greeting to us this morning.
[521.00 --> 531.00]  Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[531.00 --> 537.00]  I invite you to turn and to greet one another on this lovely Sunday, sunny morning.
[537.00 --> 558.00]  Thank you.
[558.00 --> 562.00]  Thank you.
[562.00 --> 583.50]  For our first song, we are going to ask the left side, just a minute, my left, your right
[583.50 --> 591.06]  side of the church, sing with Ashley and Kara, and then Ellie and I will do the echo with
[591.06 --> 594.48]  the other, this half, okay, the left half.
[594.48 --> 596.48]  From the depths of the sea.
[596.48 --> 603.48]  From the depths of the sea.
[603.48 --> 610.48]  From the depths of the sea.
[610.48 --> 618.48]  From the heights of the heavens.
[618.48 --> 625.48]  From the heights of the heavens.
[625.48 --> 630.48]  Your name we praise.
[630.48 --> 633.48]  From the hearts of the weak.
[633.48 --> 637.48]  From the shouts of the strong.
[637.48 --> 640.48]  From the lips of all people.
[640.48 --> 642.48]  From the lips of all people.
[642.48 --> 644.48]  From the lips of all people.
[644.48 --> 649.48]  This song we praise, Lord.
[649.48 --> 654.48]  Throughout the endless ages.
[654.48 --> 658.48]  You will be crowned with praises, Lord.
[658.48 --> 661.48]  Most High.
[661.48 --> 666.48]  Exalted in every nation.
[666.48 --> 671.48]  Sovereign of all creation, Lord.
[671.48 --> 672.48]  Most High.
[672.48 --> 673.48]  Most High.
[673.48 --> 674.48]  Be magnified.
[674.48 --> 675.48]  Be magnified.
[675.48 --> 676.48]  Be magnified.
[676.48 --> 686.48]  From the ends of the earth.
[686.48 --> 689.48]  From the depths of the terrains.
[689.48 --> 691.48]  From the depths of the sea.
[691.48 --> 699.92]  From the heights of the heavens, your name we praise.
[700.04 --> 708.60]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong,
[708.60 --> 717.92]  from the lips of all people, this song we raise, Lord,
[717.92 --> 730.36]  throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[731.44 --> 742.62]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[742.62 --> 744.70]  Be magnified.
[746.58 --> 749.10]  Be magnified.
[751.10 --> 753.28]  Be magnified.
[753.28 --> 755.28]  Be magnified.
[755.28 --> 760.28]  Be magnified.
[760.28 --> 775.70]  We will extol you God and King
[775.70 --> 780.92]  And bless your holy name
[780.92 --> 786.64]  Day after day we'll sing your praise
[786.64 --> 791.32]  Forever and forever
[791.32 --> 797.26]  One generation will call to the next
[797.26 --> 802.72]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[802.72 --> 808.08]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts
[808.08 --> 815.54]  And our voices will join with theirs in the song
[815.54 --> 826.28]  Be contemplate the splendor of the world your hands has made
[826.28 --> 837.02]  Far greater still the majesty we see in the Creator
[837.02 --> 841.70]  One generation will call to the next
[841.70 --> 847.76]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[847.76 --> 852.76]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts
[852.76 --> 861.44]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[861.44 --> 867.50]  Now may your name be sung in every tune in every place
[867.50 --> 877.24]  Saving the fame of your great love
[877.24 --> 881.74]  In every generation
[881.74 --> 887.46]  One generation will call to the next
[887.46 --> 892.66]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[892.66 --> 897.90]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts
[897.90 --> 904.60]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[904.60 --> 915.88]  You may be seated
[915.88 --> 923.36]  Our first scripture reading this morning comes from the New Testament
[923.36 --> 924.98]  The book of Hebrews
[924.98 --> 926.62]  I encourage you to open a Bible
[926.62 --> 929.50]  It will also be on the screen above us
[929.50 --> 933.28]  Please open your Bibles to Hebrews
[933.28 --> 936.72]  And that is on page 889
[936.72 --> 939.16]  Right toward the end
[939.16 --> 950.10]  And it's a little bit shorter of a reading today
[950.10 --> 951.60]  So this is Hebrews chapter 2
[951.60 --> 954.50]  Verses 5 through 11
[954.50 --> 960.82]  It is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come
[960.82 --> 962.84]  About which we are speaking
[962.84 --> 966.06]  But there is a place where someone has testified
[966.06 --> 968.78]  What is man that you are mindful of him?
[969.32 --> 971.88]  The son of man that you care for him
[971.88 --> 974.44]  You made him a little lower than the angels
[974.44 --> 977.02]  You crowned him with glory and honor
[977.02 --> 979.06]  And put everything under his feet
[979.06 --> 981.44]  And putting everything under him
[981.44 --> 984.20]  God left nothing that is not subject to him
[984.20 --> 987.96]  Yet at the present we do not see everything subject to him
[987.96 --> 989.60]  But we see Jesus
[989.60 --> 992.04]  Who is made a little lower than the angels
[992.04 --> 994.50]  Now crowned with glory and honor
[994.50 --> 996.52]  Because he suffered death
[996.52 --> 998.44]  So that by the grace of God
[998.44 --> 1000.94]  He might taste death for everyone
[1000.94 --> 1003.42]  In bringing many sons to glory
[1003.42 --> 1005.14]  It was fitting that God
[1005.14 --> 1007.68]  For whom and through whom everything exists
[1007.68 --> 1010.38]  Should make the author of their salvation
[1010.38 --> 1011.98]  Perfect through suffering
[1011.98 --> 1014.62]  Both the one who makes men holy
[1014.62 --> 1016.52]  And those who are made holy
[1016.52 --> 1018.16]  Are of the same family
[1018.16 --> 1020.28]  So Jesus is not ashamed
[1020.28 --> 1022.58]  To call them brothers
[1022.58 --> 1024.78]  This is the word of the Lord
[1024.78 --> 1027.96]  So you can remain seated
[1027.96 --> 1029.22]  While we sing our next song
[1029.22 --> 1044.86]  Are you thirsty?
[1044.86 --> 1048.14]  Are you empty?
[1048.14 --> 1053.92]  Come and drink these living waters
[1053.92 --> 1057.08]  Tired and broken
[1057.08 --> 1060.36]  Peace unspoken
[1060.36 --> 1066.16]  Rest beside these living waters
[1066.16 --> 1069.46]  Christ is calling
[1069.46 --> 1072.36]  Find refreshing
[1072.36 --> 1077.52]  At the cross of living waters
[1077.52 --> 1081.84]  Lay your life down
[1081.84 --> 1084.74]  All the old love
[1084.74 --> 1089.32]  Rise up in these living waters
[1089.32 --> 1093.52]  There's a river that flows
[1093.52 --> 1096.22]  With mercy and love
[1096.22 --> 1101.52]  Bringing joy to the city of our love
[1101.52 --> 1105.20]  There our hope is secure
[1105.20 --> 1108.06]  Do not fear anymore
[1108.06 --> 1113.92]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1113.92 --> 1120.56]  Spirit moving
[1120.56 --> 1125.10]  Mercy washing
[1125.10 --> 1129.10]  Healing in these living waters
[1129.10 --> 1132.62]  Lead your children
[1132.62 --> 1136.16]  To the shoreline
[1136.16 --> 1140.42]  Life is in these living waters
[1140.42 --> 1144.94]  There's a river that flows
[1144.94 --> 1147.62]  With mercy and love
[1147.62 --> 1153.16]  Bringing joy to the city of our love
[1153.16 --> 1156.70]  There our hope is secure
[1156.70 --> 1159.98]  Do not fear anymore
[1159.98 --> 1165.62]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1165.62 --> 1172.20]  Are you thirsty?
[1172.84 --> 1175.24]  Are you empty?
[1175.24 --> 1180.78]  Come and drink these living waters
[1180.78 --> 1184.40]  Love, forgiveness
[1184.40 --> 1187.88]  Vast and boundless
[1187.88 --> 1192.22]  Christ is our living waters
[1192.22 --> 1196.64]  There's a river that flows
[1196.64 --> 1199.26]  With mercy and love
[1199.26 --> 1204.46]  Bringing joy to the city of our love
[1204.46 --> 1208.26]  There our hope is secure
[1208.26 --> 1211.00]  Do not fear anymore
[1211.00 --> 1216.50]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1216.50 --> 1220.36]  There our hope is secure
[1220.36 --> 1223.64]  Do not fear anymore
[1223.64 --> 1229.46]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1229.46 --> 1231.20]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1231.20 --> 1233.00]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[1233.00 --> 1248.54]  So, 1 Chronicles 6, verse 10
[1248.54 --> 1250.20]  says this
[1250.20 --> 1254.10]  Glory in His holy name
[1254.10 --> 1258.72]  Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice
[1258.72 --> 1259.92]  I'll say it again
[1259.92 --> 1262.58]  Glory in His holy name
[1262.58 --> 1267.02]  Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice
[1267.02 --> 1270.20]  And so we are to glory
[1270.20 --> 1272.40]  In God's holy name
[1272.40 --> 1274.08]  We are to rejoice in the Lord
[1274.08 --> 1275.88]  Who is holy and great
[1275.88 --> 1277.14]  And an awesome God
[1277.14 --> 1280.78]  And when I reflect on that
[1280.78 --> 1282.64]  And I think about my own life
[1282.64 --> 1283.42]  My character
[1283.42 --> 1284.70]  My words
[1284.70 --> 1286.78]  And what my actions
[1286.78 --> 1288.78]  Say about Him
[1288.78 --> 1291.04]  If I'm honest
[1291.04 --> 1292.28]  I would say that
[1292.28 --> 1294.48]  My words, my actions, my thoughts
[1294.48 --> 1297.22]  They don't glorify God's holy name
[1297.22 --> 1298.26]  Very often
[1298.26 --> 1302.44]  I'm humbled when temptation comes
[1302.44 --> 1305.22]  And I give into it
[1305.22 --> 1308.24]  I'm humbled when I glory in myself
[1308.24 --> 1310.06]  Or in my so-called achievements
[1310.06 --> 1312.60]  Rather than in my creator
[1312.60 --> 1316.64]  And so that is an opportunity
[1316.64 --> 1319.20]  To confession
[1319.20 --> 1321.54]  It's to remember that we are made
[1321.54 --> 1323.46]  To glorify God's name
[1323.46 --> 1324.32]  And not our own
[1324.32 --> 1326.50]  And so we're reminded of that
[1326.50 --> 1327.86]  And then we can come before Him
[1327.86 --> 1329.00]  And ask for His help
[1329.00 --> 1329.72]  And His forgiveness
[1329.72 --> 1332.18]  And so let's, in confession
[1332.18 --> 1334.38]  Turn our hearts away from ourselves
[1334.38 --> 1336.52]  And let's lift up our gaze towards God
[1336.52 --> 1338.30]  Where it belongs
[1338.30 --> 1340.02]  And let's
[1340.02 --> 1341.64]  Would you join me
[1341.64 --> 1343.06]  In this prayer of confession
[1343.06 --> 1344.80]  Let's pray together
[1344.80 --> 1347.92]  Majestic God
[1347.92 --> 1351.56]  Who sets the sun and the moon
[1351.56 --> 1353.16]  Above us
[1353.16 --> 1355.36]  And who sets the mountains
[1355.36 --> 1356.06]  And the valleys
[1356.06 --> 1357.94]  Beneath our feet
[1357.94 --> 1361.06]  How often have we tried
[1361.06 --> 1362.88]  To hide from Your presence
[1362.88 --> 1365.60]  And how seldom have we looked
[1365.60 --> 1366.60]  For Your face
[1366.60 --> 1369.56]  Lord, You are the God
[1369.56 --> 1370.90]  Who humbled Yourself
[1370.90 --> 1372.58]  And You became a human being
[1372.58 --> 1375.28]  And being found in human form
[1375.28 --> 1376.98]  You made Yourself known to us
[1376.98 --> 1378.90]  In the face of Jesus Christ
[1378.90 --> 1381.48]  But we confess how often
[1381.48 --> 1382.52]  We have forgotten You
[1382.52 --> 1384.08]  And how seldom
[1384.08 --> 1387.00]  We have really sought to love
[1387.00 --> 1387.84]  And to follow You
[1387.84 --> 1390.60]  Have mercy on us, O God
[1390.60 --> 1392.96]  According to Your steadfast love
[1392.96 --> 1395.56]  According to Your great compassion
[1395.56 --> 1397.96]  Wash away all of our iniquity
[1397.96 --> 1400.08]  Cleanse us from our sins
[1400.08 --> 1403.72]  So that we might glorify Your holy name
[1403.72 --> 1405.60]  In our words
[1405.60 --> 1407.26]  Our thoughts
[1407.26 --> 1408.12]  Our hearts
[1408.12 --> 1409.68]  And in our actions
[1409.68 --> 1411.96]  We pray in the name of Jesus
[1411.96 --> 1412.72]  Our Savior
[1412.72 --> 1413.78]  Amen
[1413.78 --> 1417.54]  In Jesus Christ
[1417.54 --> 1418.94]  He proclaims
[1418.94 --> 1421.32]  That before Abraham was
[1421.32 --> 1422.48]  He says
[1422.48 --> 1422.50]  He says
[1422.50 --> 1423.26]  I am
[1423.26 --> 1425.56]  He has that name
[1425.56 --> 1426.96]  That is above every name
[1426.96 --> 1428.40]  And then herein
[1428.40 --> 1429.36]  When Jesus says that
[1429.36 --> 1430.70]  He points to the very mystery
[1430.70 --> 1431.52]  Of our faith
[1431.52 --> 1433.74]  That because He is Lord
[1433.74 --> 1435.44]  He is the one
[1435.44 --> 1436.98]  Who is able to restore us
[1436.98 --> 1438.00]  To Himself
[1438.00 --> 1439.54]  So that once again
[1439.54 --> 1441.14]  We can truly glorify God
[1441.14 --> 1443.30]  We can truly delight
[1443.30 --> 1444.22]  In Him
[1444.22 --> 1446.40]  And Psalm 115
[1446.40 --> 1447.66]  Assures us
[1447.66 --> 1448.90]  And reminds us
[1448.90 --> 1450.56]  Of God's mercy to us
[1450.56 --> 1451.18]  In this way
[1451.18 --> 1452.46]  Where it says this
[1452.46 --> 1453.14]  It says
[1453.14 --> 1454.16]  Not to us Lord
[1454.16 --> 1455.06]  Not to us
[1455.06 --> 1456.62]  But to Your name
[1456.62 --> 1458.34]  Be the glory
[1458.34 --> 1459.52]  Because
[1459.52 --> 1461.52]  Of Your love
[1461.52 --> 1463.00]  And faithfulness
[1463.00 --> 1463.86]  Friends
[1463.86 --> 1465.14]  God has love
[1465.14 --> 1467.14]  And He is faithful to us
[1467.14 --> 1468.28]  His covenant to us
[1468.28 --> 1469.86]  He is faithful to forgive us
[1469.86 --> 1471.06]  So let's respond
[1471.06 --> 1472.28]  In worship to this God
[1472.28 --> 1473.28]  His love
[1473.28 --> 1473.84]  His forgiveness
[1473.84 --> 1474.78]  His glory
[1474.78 --> 1476.90]  By singing our next song together
[1476.90 --> 1478.46]  So please rise
[1478.46 --> 1479.56]  And we'll sing
[1479.56 --> 1480.84]  In You
[1480.84 --> 1481.42]  O Lord
[1481.42 --> 1482.12]  I am found
[1482.12 --> 1487.56]  Lord
[1487.56 --> 1501.92]  You know me
[1501.92 --> 1504.08]  And search me out
[1504.08 --> 1506.60]  My habits and thoughts
[1506.60 --> 1509.20]  My secret doubts
[1509.20 --> 1511.70]  My dreams and thoughts
[1511.70 --> 1514.20]  The words of my mouth
[1514.20 --> 1515.72]  In You
[1515.72 --> 1516.58]  O Lord
[1516.58 --> 1518.20]  I am found
[1518.20 --> 1519.42]  Oh
[1519.42 --> 1520.64]  In You
[1520.64 --> 1521.52]  O Lord
[1521.52 --> 1523.56]  I am found
[1523.56 --> 1527.86]  I know
[1527.86 --> 1529.20]  Not all
[1529.20 --> 1530.68]  I own heart
[1530.68 --> 1531.66]  And mind
[1531.66 --> 1534.18]  My wandering soul
[1534.18 --> 1536.74]  My sleepless hearts
[1536.74 --> 1539.06]  I long for You
[1539.06 --> 1540.70]  But from You
[1540.70 --> 1541.72]  I hide
[1541.72 --> 1543.18]  In You
[1543.18 --> 1544.06]  O Lord
[1544.06 --> 1545.64]  I am found
[1545.64 --> 1546.96]  Oh
[1546.96 --> 1548.12]  In You
[1548.12 --> 1549.00]  O Lord
[1549.00 --> 1551.06]  I am found
[1551.06 --> 1555.80]  Though darkness
[1555.80 --> 1559.06]  covers my open sight
[1559.06 --> 1561.58]  The night overtakes
[1561.58 --> 1564.10]  my troubled night
[1564.10 --> 1565.10]  In darkness
[1565.10 --> 1565.42]  In darkness
[1565.42 --> 1565.98]  In darkness
[1565.98 --> 1566.48]  You
[1566.48 --> 1567.80]  My daylight
[1567.80 --> 1569.06]  will shine
[1569.06 --> 1570.54]  In You
[1570.54 --> 1571.42]  O Lord
[1571.42 --> 1573.00]  I am found
[1573.00 --> 1574.32]  Oh
[1574.32 --> 1575.42]  In You
[1575.42 --> 1576.36]  O Lord
[1576.36 --> 1578.38]  I am found
[1578.38 --> 1580.56]  O Lord
[1580.56 --> 1582.76]  In You
[1582.76 --> 1583.70]  O Lord
[1583.70 --> 1586.76]  I am found
[1586.76 --> 1588.60]  Before my birth
[1588.60 --> 1589.48]  You composed
[1589.48 --> 1591.08]  My frame
[1591.08 --> 1593.64]  You gazed in my eyes
[1593.64 --> 1596.12]  And knew my name
[1596.12 --> 1598.60]  You wrote with love
[1598.60 --> 1601.16]  Each one of my days
[1601.16 --> 1602.64]  In You
[1602.64 --> 1603.42]  O Lord
[1603.42 --> 1605.04]  I am found
[1605.04 --> 1606.36]  Oh
[1606.36 --> 1607.36]  In You
[1607.36 --> 1608.36]  O Lord
[1608.36 --> 1610.36]  I am found
[1610.36 --> 1615.68]  Where can I run
[1615.68 --> 1617.22]  From Your love
[1617.22 --> 1618.18]  So deep
[1618.18 --> 1619.72]  So boundless
[1619.72 --> 1620.54]  And strong
[1620.54 --> 1622.08]  So rich
[1622.08 --> 1622.98]  So free
[1622.98 --> 1624.58]  No height
[1624.58 --> 1625.48]  nor depth
[1625.48 --> 1627.94]  Can separate me
[1627.94 --> 1629.42]  In You
[1629.42 --> 1630.36]  O Lord
[1630.36 --> 1632.00]  I am found
[1632.00 --> 1634.32]  O in You
[1634.32 --> 1635.44]  O Lord
[1635.44 --> 1637.50]  I am found
[1637.50 --> 1639.32]  In You
[1639.32 --> 1640.22]  O Lord
[1640.22 --> 1641.86]  I am found
[1641.86 --> 1644.32]  O in You
[1644.32 --> 1645.48]  O Lord
[1645.48 --> 1647.92]  I am found
[1647.92 --> 1664.90]  All right
[1664.90 --> 1665.44]  So the kids
[1665.44 --> 1666.18]  are dismissed
[1666.18 --> 1667.02]  to go to their classes
[1667.02 --> 1668.32]  and then next week
[1668.32 --> 1669.16]  we'll just have
[1669.16 --> 1670.68]  one combined class
[1670.68 --> 1672.14]  for the summer months
[1672.14 --> 1681.06]  So good morning again
[1681.06 --> 1685.46]  and summer is officially here
[1685.46 --> 1687.60]  right I think it was Thursday
[1687.60 --> 1688.50]  last Thursday
[1688.50 --> 1690.28]  I think so
[1690.28 --> 1690.56]  okay
[1690.56 --> 1692.20]  so summer is here
[1692.20 --> 1692.94]  and you know
[1692.94 --> 1694.22]  with the summer brings
[1694.22 --> 1695.78]  some very welcome
[1695.78 --> 1698.22]  changes to the regular rhythms
[1698.22 --> 1699.10]  of our life
[1699.10 --> 1699.38]  you know
[1699.38 --> 1700.48]  and over the summer
[1700.48 --> 1701.76]  many of you are
[1701.76 --> 1703.58]  likely anticipating
[1703.58 --> 1704.84]  spending more time
[1704.84 --> 1706.44]  with family and friends
[1706.44 --> 1708.26]  perhaps doing some traveling
[1708.26 --> 1709.06]  and camping
[1709.06 --> 1710.86]  all good
[1710.86 --> 1712.22]  and lovely things
[1712.22 --> 1713.36]  and I am looking forward
[1713.36 --> 1714.36]  to some of those things
[1714.36 --> 1714.80]  as well
[1714.80 --> 1716.50]  and as we enter
[1716.50 --> 1717.32]  into this season
[1717.32 --> 1717.88]  of the summer
[1717.88 --> 1719.88]  I think it's a great time
[1719.88 --> 1720.98]  to turn
[1720.98 --> 1722.20]  to the Psalms
[1722.20 --> 1724.00]  and you know
[1724.00 --> 1725.10]  I love what
[1725.10 --> 1726.34]  Eugene Peterson
[1726.34 --> 1727.68]  the late Eugene Peterson
[1727.68 --> 1729.12]  wrote about the Psalms
[1729.12 --> 1730.86]  he said this
[1730.86 --> 1735.78]  the Psalms
[1735.78 --> 1736.38]  bring us
[1736.38 --> 1738.24]  into the large country
[1738.24 --> 1740.44]  of God's creation
[1740.44 --> 1741.90]  and salvation
[1741.90 --> 1748.38]  so in a sense
[1748.38 --> 1748.90]  we're all going
[1748.90 --> 1749.70]  traveling together
[1749.70 --> 1750.22]  this summer
[1750.22 --> 1751.44]  into this
[1751.44 --> 1752.82]  large country
[1752.82 --> 1754.76]  of God's creation
[1754.76 --> 1756.34]  and God's salvation
[1756.34 --> 1757.64]  and I love that image
[1757.64 --> 1758.74]  of this largeness
[1758.74 --> 1759.92]  of who God is
[1759.92 --> 1761.02]  and so that's the invitation
[1761.02 --> 1762.00]  to us this summer
[1762.00 --> 1763.46]  to spend some time
[1763.46 --> 1765.32]  in this large country
[1765.32 --> 1766.08]  of God
[1766.08 --> 1767.96]  and so today
[1767.96 --> 1769.28]  we will turn
[1769.28 --> 1770.50]  to Psalm 8
[1770.50 --> 1772.36]  so please open your Bibles
[1772.36 --> 1773.48]  and turn with me
[1773.48 --> 1775.04]  to Psalm 8
[1775.04 --> 1775.90]  and we will
[1775.90 --> 1777.32]  be looking at it
[1777.32 --> 1777.80]  in detail
[1777.80 --> 1778.78]  together today
[1778.78 --> 1782.56]  so that's on
[1782.56 --> 1784.84]  page 403
[1784.84 --> 1789.42]  403
[1789.42 --> 1790.90]  Psalm 8
[1790.90 --> 1793.32]  can you all hear me okay
[1793.32 --> 1794.14]  I feel I'm quiet
[1794.14 --> 1795.26]  but it's okay
[1795.26 --> 1795.96]  alright
[1795.96 --> 1796.62]  alright
[1796.62 --> 1798.76]  so let's give
[1798.76 --> 1799.86]  our attention
[1799.86 --> 1800.38]  to the reading
[1800.38 --> 1800.94]  of God's word
[1800.94 --> 1801.68]  this is a Psalm
[1801.68 --> 1802.24]  of David
[1802.24 --> 1803.70]  and I'll read it
[1803.70 --> 1804.14]  for us
[1804.14 --> 1806.24]  O Lord
[1806.24 --> 1807.46]  our Lord
[1807.46 --> 1808.72]  how majestic
[1808.72 --> 1809.74]  is your name
[1809.74 --> 1810.56]  in all the earth
[1810.56 --> 1812.02]  you have set
[1812.02 --> 1812.72]  your glory
[1812.72 --> 1813.58]  above the heavens
[1813.58 --> 1815.10]  from the lips
[1815.10 --> 1815.64]  of children
[1815.64 --> 1816.38]  and infants
[1816.38 --> 1817.72]  you have ordained praise
[1817.72 --> 1819.16]  because of your enemies
[1819.16 --> 1821.06]  to silence the foe
[1821.06 --> 1821.84]  and the avenger
[1821.84 --> 1823.44]  when I consider
[1823.44 --> 1824.12]  your heavens
[1824.12 --> 1825.32]  the work
[1825.32 --> 1826.32]  of your fingers
[1826.32 --> 1827.52]  the moon
[1827.52 --> 1828.28]  and the stars
[1828.28 --> 1829.16]  which you have set
[1829.16 --> 1829.70]  in place
[1829.70 --> 1831.54]  what is man
[1831.54 --> 1832.88]  that you are mindful
[1832.88 --> 1833.30]  of him
[1833.30 --> 1835.16]  the son of man
[1835.16 --> 1836.30]  that you care
[1836.30 --> 1836.76]  for him
[1836.76 --> 1838.26]  you have made him
[1838.26 --> 1838.98]  a little lower
[1838.98 --> 1840.24]  than the heavenly beings
[1840.24 --> 1841.36]  and crowned him
[1841.36 --> 1841.98]  with glory
[1841.98 --> 1842.60]  and honor
[1842.60 --> 1844.06]  you made him
[1844.06 --> 1844.42]  ruler
[1844.42 --> 1845.12]  of the works
[1845.12 --> 1845.86]  of your hands
[1845.86 --> 1847.02]  you put everything
[1847.02 --> 1848.12]  under his feet
[1848.12 --> 1850.22]  all flocks
[1850.22 --> 1852.44]  and herds
[1852.44 --> 1853.88]  and the beasts
[1853.88 --> 1854.70]  of the field
[1854.70 --> 1855.38]  the birds
[1855.38 --> 1855.96]  of the air
[1855.96 --> 1856.56]  and the fish
[1856.56 --> 1857.16]  of the sea
[1857.16 --> 1858.36]  all that swim
[1858.36 --> 1859.10]  the paths
[1859.10 --> 1859.80]  of the sea
[1859.80 --> 1860.78]  O Lord
[1860.78 --> 1861.58]  our Lord
[1861.58 --> 1862.78]  how majestic
[1862.78 --> 1863.64]  is your name
[1863.64 --> 1865.26]  in all the earth
[1865.26 --> 1868.02]  this is the word
[1868.02 --> 1868.48]  of the Lord
[1868.48 --> 1871.22]  let's come before
[1871.22 --> 1871.48]  the Lord
[1871.48 --> 1871.84]  in prayer
[1871.84 --> 1874.84]  O Lord
[1874.84 --> 1875.38]  we've heard
[1875.38 --> 1875.94]  your word
[1875.94 --> 1876.88]  to us this morning
[1876.88 --> 1877.56]  that you
[1877.56 --> 1878.92]  are majestic
[1878.92 --> 1880.94]  and so that
[1880.94 --> 1881.82]  is our prayer
[1881.82 --> 1882.36]  this morning
[1882.36 --> 1882.82]  that
[1882.82 --> 1884.40]  we
[1884.40 --> 1885.40]  would
[1885.40 --> 1888.28]  nothing less
[1888.28 --> 1889.46]  than be able
[1889.46 --> 1890.12]  to see
[1890.12 --> 1891.52]  your majesty
[1891.52 --> 1893.56]  in your glory
[1893.56 --> 1894.26]  this morning
[1894.26 --> 1895.46]  to see even clearer
[1895.46 --> 1896.44]  and would you be
[1896.44 --> 1897.68]  high and lifted up
[1897.68 --> 1898.36]  in our hearts
[1898.36 --> 1899.12]  and our minds
[1899.12 --> 1900.18]  this morning
[1900.18 --> 1901.16]  as we open up
[1901.16 --> 1901.62]  your word
[1901.62 --> 1903.50]  we pray for the help
[1903.50 --> 1904.70]  of your spirit
[1904.70 --> 1906.62]  to enlighten us
[1906.62 --> 1907.16]  and to open
[1907.16 --> 1908.10]  your word to us
[1908.10 --> 1908.90]  so that we might
[1908.90 --> 1910.40]  know and glorify you
[1910.40 --> 1911.54]  and we pray this
[1911.54 --> 1912.20]  in Christ's name
[1912.20 --> 1912.82]  Amen
[1912.82 --> 1915.18]  so I want to begin
[1915.18 --> 1916.22]  with a
[1916.22 --> 1917.70]  antidote
[1917.70 --> 1918.80]  about
[1918.80 --> 1919.42]  Harvard
[1919.42 --> 1920.14]  University
[1920.14 --> 1922.36]  so in the decades
[1922.36 --> 1923.34]  after the
[1923.34 --> 1924.22]  American Civil
[1924.22 --> 1925.12]  Civil War
[1925.12 --> 1926.34]  in the midst
[1926.34 --> 1927.96]  of many expansions
[1927.96 --> 1929.24]  Harvard University
[1929.24 --> 1929.90]  was building
[1929.90 --> 1930.84]  a new building
[1930.84 --> 1931.98]  to house
[1931.98 --> 1932.96]  its philosophy
[1932.96 --> 1933.84]  department
[1933.84 --> 1935.60]  and it was
[1935.60 --> 1936.34]  to be called
[1936.34 --> 1938.10]  Emerson Hall
[1938.10 --> 1939.30]  it was named
[1939.30 --> 1940.08]  after
[1940.08 --> 1941.62]  Ralph Waldo
[1941.62 --> 1941.98]  Emerson
[1941.98 --> 1942.62]  who is the
[1942.62 --> 1943.44]  great American
[1943.44 --> 1944.02]  philosopher
[1944.02 --> 1945.12]  transcendentalist
[1945.12 --> 1946.26]  and a
[1946.26 --> 1946.92]  Harvard alum
[1946.92 --> 1949.14]  so as plans
[1949.14 --> 1949.66]  proceeded
[1949.66 --> 1950.68]  for Emerson Hall
[1950.68 --> 1951.26]  a committee
[1951.26 --> 1951.86]  of faculty
[1951.86 --> 1952.48]  was asked
[1952.48 --> 1952.98]  to come up
[1952.98 --> 1954.26]  with an inscription
[1954.26 --> 1955.06]  that would go
[1955.06 --> 1955.84]  on the face
[1955.84 --> 1956.36]  of the building
[1956.36 --> 1957.66]  above the entrance
[1957.66 --> 1959.60]  to the building
[1959.60 --> 1960.38]  above the doors
[1960.38 --> 1961.86]  and what they
[1961.86 --> 1962.32]  proposed
[1962.32 --> 1963.70]  was this quote
[1963.70 --> 1964.50]  by the Greek
[1964.50 --> 1965.20]  philosopher
[1965.20 --> 1966.50]  Protagoras
[1966.50 --> 1968.16]  so here is
[1968.16 --> 1969.92]  what he says
[1969.92 --> 1970.94]  man
[1970.94 --> 1972.54]  is the measure
[1972.54 --> 1974.16]  of all things
[1974.16 --> 1976.40]  now you see
[1976.40 --> 1976.98]  this was very
[1976.98 --> 1978.54]  fitting for the age
[1978.54 --> 1980.14]  this age
[1980.14 --> 1980.70]  that Harvard
[1980.70 --> 1981.80]  was entering into
[1981.80 --> 1982.76]  it was an age
[1982.76 --> 1983.36]  when because
[1983.36 --> 1984.32]  of the traumas
[1984.32 --> 1984.82]  of the American
[1984.82 --> 1985.44]  Civil War
[1985.44 --> 1986.74]  many people
[1986.74 --> 1987.68]  were kind of
[1987.68 --> 1988.36]  turning away
[1988.36 --> 1988.94]  from God
[1988.94 --> 1989.44]  they were turning
[1989.44 --> 1990.16]  away from
[1990.16 --> 1990.62]  the Christian
[1990.62 --> 1991.10]  faith
[1991.10 --> 1992.50]  so apart
[1992.50 --> 1993.22]  from faith
[1993.22 --> 1993.94]  in God
[1993.94 --> 1995.00]  man
[1995.00 --> 1996.30]  is the measure
[1996.30 --> 1997.24]  of all things
[1997.24 --> 1999.36]  so now
[1999.36 --> 2000.00]  you can imagine
[2000.00 --> 2000.66]  the faculty
[2000.66 --> 2001.30]  surprise
[2001.30 --> 2002.68]  when the
[2002.68 --> 2003.08]  president
[2003.08 --> 2003.74]  of Harvard
[2003.74 --> 2004.58]  at that time
[2004.58 --> 2005.52]  chose a different
[2005.52 --> 2006.02]  inscription
[2006.02 --> 2007.18]  to put above
[2007.18 --> 2007.68]  the door
[2007.68 --> 2008.56]  of the philosophy
[2008.56 --> 2009.42]  department building
[2009.42 --> 2011.10]  he chose
[2011.10 --> 2011.74]  this
[2011.74 --> 2013.14]  Psalm
[2013.14 --> 2014.30]  8
[2014.30 --> 2015.50]  verse 4
[2015.50 --> 2016.24]  and you may not
[2016.24 --> 2016.86]  be able to see it
[2016.86 --> 2017.42]  very well
[2017.42 --> 2017.96]  on the picture
[2017.96 --> 2018.50]  I don't know
[2018.50 --> 2019.60]  but it says
[2019.60 --> 2021.30]  what is man
[2021.30 --> 2022.56]  that thou
[2022.56 --> 2023.62]  art mindful
[2023.62 --> 2024.38]  of him
[2024.38 --> 2026.70]  cool right
[2026.70 --> 2027.84]  it's right there
[2027.84 --> 2028.64]  inscribed in
[2028.64 --> 2029.12]  granite
[2029.12 --> 2030.32]  above the
[2030.32 --> 2031.52]  on the building
[2031.52 --> 2032.04]  of the philosophy
[2032.04 --> 2032.50]  department
[2032.50 --> 2034.38]  what is man
[2034.38 --> 2034.86]  that thou
[2034.86 --> 2035.46]  art mindful
[2035.46 --> 2035.96]  of him
[2035.96 --> 2037.20]  and so saying
[2037.20 --> 2037.90]  you know
[2037.90 --> 2038.36]  there's quite
[2038.36 --> 2039.08]  a fork
[2039.08 --> 2039.94]  in the road
[2039.94 --> 2040.78]  right so to say
[2040.78 --> 2041.20]  between
[2041.20 --> 2042.34]  these two
[2042.34 --> 2042.94]  sayings
[2042.94 --> 2044.12]  right
[2044.12 --> 2045.06]  what is mankind
[2045.06 --> 2045.94]  that you are
[2045.94 --> 2046.88]  mindful of him
[2046.88 --> 2047.94]  it's a question
[2047.94 --> 2049.02]  addressed to God
[2049.02 --> 2050.34]  asking God
[2050.34 --> 2051.72]  who are we
[2051.72 --> 2053.40]  what is
[2053.40 --> 2054.00]  mankind
[2054.00 --> 2054.82]  who have you
[2054.82 --> 2055.40]  made us
[2055.40 --> 2055.92]  to be
[2055.92 --> 2057.72]  and it's to say
[2057.72 --> 2058.20]  that if we're
[2058.20 --> 2058.72]  going to know
[2058.72 --> 2059.78]  anything about
[2059.78 --> 2060.58]  who we are
[2060.58 --> 2061.72]  we need to
[2061.72 --> 2062.70]  begin by asking
[2062.70 --> 2063.20]  the one who
[2063.20 --> 2063.78]  made us
[2063.78 --> 2066.32]  now there's
[2066.32 --> 2066.88]  a massive
[2066.88 --> 2067.62]  difference between
[2067.62 --> 2068.66]  that and
[2068.66 --> 2069.84]  saying man
[2069.84 --> 2070.74]  is the measure
[2070.74 --> 2071.60]  of all things
[2071.60 --> 2072.60]  right which is to
[2072.60 --> 2073.42]  say if we want
[2073.42 --> 2074.08]  to know who we
[2074.08 --> 2075.52]  are we need
[2075.52 --> 2076.08]  to look
[2076.08 --> 2077.22]  to ourselves
[2077.22 --> 2079.72]  and in that
[2079.72 --> 2081.16]  idea is
[2081.16 --> 2082.06]  what has so
[2082.06 --> 2083.64]  much emphasis
[2083.64 --> 2085.06]  in our culture
[2085.06 --> 2085.86]  today right
[2085.86 --> 2086.48]  and it's this
[2086.48 --> 2087.62]  concept of
[2087.62 --> 2088.28]  expressive
[2088.28 --> 2089.28]  individualism
[2089.28 --> 2090.42]  it's this idea
[2090.42 --> 2091.08]  that many people
[2091.08 --> 2091.88]  have today that
[2091.88 --> 2092.86]  to truly discover
[2092.86 --> 2094.16]  yourself who
[2094.16 --> 2095.24]  you really are
[2095.24 --> 2096.30]  what you need
[2096.30 --> 2097.28]  to do is cast
[2097.28 --> 2098.10]  away anyone
[2098.10 --> 2099.22]  else's expectations
[2099.22 --> 2100.08]  of you even
[2100.08 --> 2101.48]  God's expectations
[2101.48 --> 2103.18]  of you and to
[2103.18 --> 2103.78]  try to live
[2103.78 --> 2104.60]  according to
[2104.60 --> 2106.24]  what your deepest
[2106.24 --> 2107.28]  desire is even
[2107.28 --> 2107.80]  though it's so
[2107.80 --> 2108.58]  hard to figure out
[2108.58 --> 2109.14]  what your deepest
[2109.14 --> 2110.02]  desire is with
[2110.02 --> 2110.30]  all of our
[2110.30 --> 2111.40]  conflicting desires
[2111.40 --> 2112.16]  that we all have
[2112.16 --> 2113.76]  but it's this idea
[2113.76 --> 2114.30]  where you need to
[2114.30 --> 2114.80]  write your own
[2114.80 --> 2116.56]  story man is the
[2116.56 --> 2117.06]  measure of all
[2117.06 --> 2118.96]  things but what
[2118.96 --> 2119.90]  we find in Psalm
[2119.90 --> 2121.18]  8 is that God
[2121.18 --> 2122.50]  has told us who
[2122.50 --> 2124.20]  we are right
[2124.20 --> 2125.58]  God has already
[2125.58 --> 2126.72]  given us profound
[2126.72 --> 2127.72]  answers to the
[2127.72 --> 2129.40]  question what is
[2129.40 --> 2132.74]  mankind and so
[2132.74 --> 2133.96]  that now we can
[2133.96 --> 2134.60]  ask him we can
[2134.60 --> 2135.68]  ask our creator
[2135.68 --> 2137.26]  who made us and
[2137.26 --> 2138.80]  we can say who
[2138.80 --> 2140.24]  are we what is
[2140.24 --> 2142.38]  mankind and so
[2142.38 --> 2143.18]  that's what Psalm
[2143.18 --> 2143.92]  8 does it
[2143.92 --> 2144.68]  Psalm 8 gives us
[2144.68 --> 2145.46]  a couple answers
[2145.46 --> 2146.50]  to this question
[2146.50 --> 2148.26]  of what is
[2148.26 --> 2150.02]  mankind who are
[2150.02 --> 2151.06]  we and so that's
[2151.06 --> 2152.00]  what I want us to
[2152.00 --> 2152.82]  look at today as
[2152.82 --> 2153.48]  we look at Psalm
[2153.48 --> 2155.44]  8 so we'll look
[2155.44 --> 2156.02]  at a few things
[2156.02 --> 2156.60]  and the first one
[2156.60 --> 2157.32]  is this the first
[2157.32 --> 2157.92]  point what has
[2157.92 --> 2159.42]  mankind the answer
[2159.42 --> 2161.18]  is we are
[2161.18 --> 2163.18]  worshipers we are
[2163.18 --> 2164.74]  worshipers we are
[2164.74 --> 2166.70]  in a sense most
[2166.70 --> 2169.02]  human most our
[2169.02 --> 2170.98]  truest selves when
[2170.98 --> 2172.02]  we are praising God
[2172.02 --> 2174.04]  when we are glorifying
[2174.04 --> 2175.74]  God's name and we
[2175.74 --> 2176.86]  see this in verses
[2176.86 --> 2179.54]  1 and 9 in Psalm
[2179.54 --> 2181.60]  8 and you know as
[2181.60 --> 2182.30]  we read it you may
[2182.30 --> 2183.56]  have noticed that
[2183.56 --> 2185.56]  the very first verse
[2185.56 --> 2187.14]  and the very last
[2187.14 --> 2188.22]  verse have the exact
[2188.22 --> 2189.60]  same words it says
[2189.60 --> 2191.34]  Lord our Lord how
[2191.34 --> 2192.74]  majestic is your name
[2192.74 --> 2194.12]  in all the earth and
[2194.12 --> 2194.90]  then verse 9 it
[2194.90 --> 2195.78]  closes saying the same
[2195.78 --> 2196.88]  thing oh Lord our
[2196.88 --> 2197.98]  Lord how majestic is
[2197.98 --> 2198.64]  your name in all the
[2198.64 --> 2200.28]  earth it begins and
[2200.28 --> 2202.02]  it ends with praise it
[2202.02 --> 2203.70]  says inclusio and so
[2203.70 --> 2204.82]  what that tells us is
[2204.82 --> 2206.52]  the very first thing
[2206.52 --> 2207.78]  the psalm says about
[2207.78 --> 2208.44]  what it means to be
[2208.44 --> 2209.64]  a human being who
[2209.64 --> 2210.72]  we are is that it
[2210.72 --> 2212.12]  begins and it ends
[2212.12 --> 2214.32]  with worship we were
[2214.32 --> 2215.70]  made to be worshipers
[2215.70 --> 2217.90]  of God yeah have you
[2217.90 --> 2218.86]  heard the term of
[2218.86 --> 2219.60]  course you have but
[2219.60 --> 2221.94]  homo sapien right so
[2221.94 --> 2223.00]  homo sapien is a
[2223.00 --> 2224.74]  scientific term for us
[2224.74 --> 2226.48]  humanity it was first
[2226.48 --> 2228.08]  used by Carl Linnaeus
[2228.08 --> 2230.00]  he was an 18th century
[2230.00 --> 2232.46]  Swedish biologist he
[2232.46 --> 2234.64]  created this modern
[2234.64 --> 2236.64]  modern system of
[2236.64 --> 2238.64]  taxonomy of of naming
[2238.64 --> 2239.64]  and categorizing
[2239.64 --> 2241.84]  organisms you know
[2241.84 --> 2243.14]  species and genus and
[2243.14 --> 2243.98]  all that stuff that I
[2243.98 --> 2244.64]  learned a long long
[2244.64 --> 2247.64]  time ago now he was an
[2247.64 --> 2249.64]  enlightenment figure so
[2249.64 --> 2251.64]  it makes sense that he
[2251.64 --> 2253.64]  named humanity for our
[2253.64 --> 2255.64]  capacity to know right
[2255.64 --> 2257.64]  homo sapien homo in
[2257.64 --> 2260.64]  Latin is man sapien means
[2260.64 --> 2261.64]  knowledge or wisdom we are
[2261.64 --> 2264.64]  knowing man we are
[2264.64 --> 2265.64]  creatures who have
[2265.64 --> 2267.64]  knowledge now what if
[2267.64 --> 2269.64]  though there is something
[2269.64 --> 2272.64]  that is deeper more basic
[2272.64 --> 2274.64]  to our nature than merely
[2274.64 --> 2276.64]  knowing sure we are knowing
[2276.64 --> 2278.64]  man but the Bible says
[2278.64 --> 2279.64]  there's something more
[2279.64 --> 2280.64]  profound about who we are
[2280.64 --> 2282.64]  it says that first and
[2282.64 --> 2283.64]  foremost we are worshiping
[2283.64 --> 2285.64]  creatures so the most of the
[2285.64 --> 2287.64]  more fitting classification for
[2287.64 --> 2289.64]  us is not homo sapien but
[2289.64 --> 2292.64]  maybe homo adorans the
[2292.64 --> 2294.64]  adoring man the adoring
[2294.64 --> 2296.64]  creature so what is
[2296.64 --> 2298.64]  mankind what is a human
[2298.64 --> 2301.64]  being we are worshipers and
[2301.64 --> 2304.64]  our worship is attracted and
[2304.64 --> 2306.64]  it points to what we think
[2306.64 --> 2308.64]  what we find most glorious
[2308.64 --> 2310.64]  right we are glory seekers
[2310.64 --> 2312.64]  every single one of us we seek
[2312.64 --> 2314.64]  glory we worship glory
[2314.64 --> 2318.64]  glory although we differ in what
[2318.64 --> 2319.64]  we might find most glorious so
[2319.64 --> 2323.64]  some of us might find glory in
[2323.64 --> 2325.64]  the music of Bach some of us
[2325.64 --> 2331.64]  maybe in Beatles the beach boys
[2331.64 --> 2332.64]  Bon Iver I was just gonna say
[2332.64 --> 2333.64]  Bon Iver but I don't think you
[2333.64 --> 2336.64]  know what that is the Beatles
[2336.64 --> 2337.64]  right so we have different tastes
[2337.64 --> 2339.64]  of what glory is some of us find
[2339.64 --> 2342.64]  glory in the Canucks some of us
[2342.64 --> 2347.64]  some of us find glory misplaced as
[2347.64 --> 2351.64]  it is in other teams there are
[2351.64 --> 2352.64]  many things that we love to
[2352.64 --> 2354.64]  glorify but there is a
[2354.64 --> 2357.64]  surpassing glory that we were
[2357.64 --> 2359.64]  made to praise that is the
[2359.64 --> 2360.64]  source of the foundation of
[2360.64 --> 2362.64]  every lesser glory that there is
[2362.64 --> 2364.64]  in this world and the psalm tells
[2364.64 --> 2367.64]  us that that is the Lord he is
[2367.64 --> 2370.64]  most worthy of praise oh Lord oh
[2370.64 --> 2374.64]  Lord oh Lord how majestic is your name
[2374.64 --> 2378.64]  in all the earth the most majestic
[2378.64 --> 2382.64]  the most worthy of glory is the Lord
[2382.64 --> 2385.64]  and then David the writer he continues
[2385.64 --> 2387.64]  there in verse one where he says
[2387.64 --> 2389.64]  you have set your glory in the heavens
[2389.64 --> 2391.64]  so I imagine you know David wrote
[2391.64 --> 2393.64]  this and I can imagine him maybe as a
[2393.64 --> 2396.64]  shepherd boy lying there on the hillside
[2396.64 --> 2400.64]  in Bethlehem gazing up looking into the heavens
[2400.64 --> 2403.64]  seeing the tens of thousands and millions
[2403.64 --> 2406.64]  of stars in the sky and as he looks
[2406.64 --> 2409.64]  and as he gazes at the heavens he is just
[2409.64 --> 2413.64]  simply awestruck at the magnificence of
[2413.64 --> 2417.64]  who God is it reminds him of the greatness
[2417.64 --> 2420.64]  of God who created every one of those stars
[2420.64 --> 2424.64]  in the moon and it leads us to worship God
[2424.64 --> 2427.64]  and not only that verse 2 as we continue
[2427.64 --> 2431.64]  it tells us that even the infants praise God
[2431.64 --> 2435.64]  it says through the praise of children and infants
[2435.64 --> 2437.64]  you have established a stronghold
[2437.64 --> 2440.64]  it's a stronghold of praise against your enemies
[2440.64 --> 2443.64]  to silence the foe and the avenger
[2443.64 --> 2447.64]  now in the Gospels Matthew chapter 21
[2447.64 --> 2452.64]  Jesus quotes that verse in his kind of fight
[2452.64 --> 2455.64]  with the religious rulers in Jerusalem
[2455.64 --> 2459.64]  they're mad that at the temple the children
[2459.64 --> 2461.64]  are singing Hosanna and they're praising Jesus
[2461.64 --> 2465.64]  and Jesus says to them have you never read
[2465.64 --> 2469.64]  from Psalm 8 from the lips of children and infants
[2469.64 --> 2473.64]  you Lord have called forth praise
[2473.64 --> 2477.64]  so this is who we were made to be even infants and children
[2477.64 --> 2479.64]  we praise God
[2479.64 --> 2483.64]  you know and it's often children who get God the most
[2483.64 --> 2484.64]  right?
[2484.64 --> 2489.64]  who take such delight in just praising God for who he is
[2489.64 --> 2493.64]  so that's the first way Psalm 8 answers our question this morning
[2493.64 --> 2495.64]  what is mankind?
[2495.64 --> 2497.64]  it says we are worshipers
[2497.64 --> 2501.64]  the second thing that Psalm 8 tells us about our humanity
[2501.64 --> 2503.64]  is that we are weak
[2503.64 --> 2505.64]  yet
[2505.64 --> 2507.64]  we are cared for
[2507.64 --> 2509.64]  okay we are weak yet cared for
[2509.64 --> 2512.64]  we see this in verses 3 and 4
[2512.64 --> 2513.64]  it says this
[2513.64 --> 2515.64]  when I consider
[2515.64 --> 2517.64]  your heavens the work of your fingers
[2517.64 --> 2519.64]  the moon and stars which you have set in place
[2519.64 --> 2521.64]  what is mankind that you are mindful of them
[2521.64 --> 2523.64]  human beings that you care for them
[2523.64 --> 2525.64]  you know so David
[2525.64 --> 2527.64]  maybe he's lying there
[2527.64 --> 2529.64]  gazing at the night sky
[2529.64 --> 2531.64]  at the stars and moon
[2531.64 --> 2532.64]  and he's like
[2532.64 --> 2533.64]  wow
[2533.64 --> 2534.64]  right?
[2534.64 --> 2535.64]  God's
[2535.64 --> 2536.64]  he says God's fingers
[2536.64 --> 2537.64]  can do that
[2537.64 --> 2539.64]  and I it's such a great image
[2539.64 --> 2540.64]  this idea of God's fingers
[2540.64 --> 2541.64]  right?
[2541.64 --> 2543.64]  creating all of these things
[2543.64 --> 2545.64]  this image of God as an artist
[2545.64 --> 2548.64]  forming and shaping the world
[2548.64 --> 2551.64]  into this unbelievable beauty
[2551.64 --> 2554.64]  and as David considers the glory of the heavens
[2554.64 --> 2555.64]  that God made
[2555.64 --> 2557.64]  he then kind of turns
[2557.64 --> 2559.64]  and he reflects on himself as a human being
[2559.64 --> 2560.64]  and he's like
[2560.64 --> 2566.64]  we're nothing compared to the magnitude of the moon and stars
[2566.64 --> 2569.64]  who are we God that you would even think of us
[2569.64 --> 2573.64]  in comparison to all of that
[2573.64 --> 2576.64]  have you ever wondered that yourself?
[2576.64 --> 2578.64]  have you ever kind of looked at the world and thought
[2578.64 --> 2583.64]  how is it that God even cares or thinks of me?
[2583.64 --> 2586.64]  I think it's a common human experience
[2586.64 --> 2588.64]  so in 1977
[2588.64 --> 2593.64]  NASA launched the Voyager 1 spacecraft
[2593.64 --> 2594.64]  okay 1977
[2594.64 --> 2596.64]  and then 13 years later
[2596.64 --> 2601.64]  the spacecraft reached the outer limits of our solar system
[2601.64 --> 2604.64]  3.7 billion miles from the sun
[2604.64 --> 2606.64]  and NASA
[2606.64 --> 2608.64]  they were about to lose contact with Voyager 1
[2608.64 --> 2610.64]  because it was so far away
[2610.64 --> 2613.64]  so one of the last things they did was commanded
[2613.64 --> 2615.64]  the spacecraft to turn
[2615.64 --> 2618.64]  and to take a photo of Earth
[2618.64 --> 2622.64]  and so the picture of the Earth is called
[2622.64 --> 2624.64]  the pale blue dot
[2624.64 --> 2627.64]  here it is
[2627.64 --> 2629.64]  the pale blue dot
[2629.64 --> 2631.64]  can you see the dot?
[2631.64 --> 2632.64]  it's like a pixel
[2632.64 --> 2633.64]  it's very small
[2633.64 --> 2634.64]  but I made the big sign
[2634.64 --> 2636.64]  you are here
[2636.64 --> 2637.64]  it's a fitting title
[2637.64 --> 2639.64]  because all it is
[2639.64 --> 2641.64]  is basically this sea of blue
[2641.64 --> 2644.64]  and you can barely see the Earth
[2646.64 --> 2648.64]  and friends that is who we are
[2648.64 --> 2649.64]  right?
[2649.64 --> 2651.64]  in this vast sea of the universe
[2651.64 --> 2654.64]  that is what we live on
[2654.64 --> 2657.64]  and then even for us on this Earth
[2657.64 --> 2659.64]  the Earth is huge
[2659.64 --> 2660.64]  right?
[2660.64 --> 2661.64]  it's expansive
[2661.64 --> 2662.64]  you know as soon as
[2662.64 --> 2664.64]  we're not used to stuff so big
[2664.64 --> 2665.64]  coming from the states
[2665.64 --> 2666.64]  you know you drive a bit
[2666.64 --> 2667.64]  you cross state lines
[2667.64 --> 2669.64]  you know you kind of feel like you're moving along
[2669.64 --> 2670.64]  and here in BC
[2670.64 --> 2671.64]  you just drive
[2671.64 --> 2672.64]  and you're like still in BC
[2672.64 --> 2673.64]  still in BC
[2673.64 --> 2674.64]  driving, driving
[2674.64 --> 2675.64]  right?
[2675.64 --> 2676.64]  it's so big
[2676.64 --> 2679.64]  and this province is huge
[2679.64 --> 2682.64]  and then you realize just how big the Earth is
[2682.64 --> 2686.64]  we are a dot on this Earth
[2686.64 --> 2689.64]  and so we are a tiny dot on a tiny dot
[2689.64 --> 2690.64]  alright?
[2690.64 --> 2692.64]  that is who we are as human beings
[2692.64 --> 2694.64]  and when the Psalm says
[2694.64 --> 2697.64]  what is mankind that you are mindful of us
[2697.64 --> 2700.64]  it's recognizing just how humble
[2700.64 --> 2703.64]  and powerless we truly are
[2703.64 --> 2705.64]  and to recognize that
[2705.64 --> 2706.64]  to recognize our limits
[2706.64 --> 2707.64]  our humanity
[2707.64 --> 2713.64]  is actually to live into who God made us to be
[2713.64 --> 2714.64]  right?
[2714.64 --> 2717.64]  you know in the people I know who can admit to their limits
[2717.64 --> 2718.64]  their weakness
[2718.64 --> 2721.64]  they are some of the most content
[2721.64 --> 2723.64]  happy peaceful people
[2723.64 --> 2724.64]  right?
[2724.64 --> 2725.64]  there's no pretension
[2725.64 --> 2728.64]  making yourself bigger than you really are
[2728.64 --> 2729.64]  there's no pretending
[2729.64 --> 2734.64]  you know and for example to be human is not to be anxious about tomorrow
[2734.64 --> 2736.64]  the Bible says
[2736.64 --> 2738.64]  like what do you know about tomorrow?
[2738.64 --> 2739.64]  nothing
[2739.64 --> 2742.64]  you can't control what happens
[2742.64 --> 2745.64]  because you are human
[2745.64 --> 2747.64]  and the more you make peace with that
[2747.64 --> 2749.64]  and the more you then trust in the Lord
[2749.64 --> 2752.64]  the more fully human you become
[2754.64 --> 2758.64]  but even though we are this tiny dot on a tiny dot in God's universe
[2758.64 --> 2762.64]  even though we are so weak and frail and small
[2762.64 --> 2765.64]  and even though God is so powerful and mighty and majestic
[2765.64 --> 2769.64]  yet he is so intensely interested in you
[2769.64 --> 2773.64]  and he is intensely interested in me
[2774.64 --> 2775.64]  as David puts it here
[2775.64 --> 2778.64]  the Lord is mindful of us
[2778.64 --> 2779.64]  he cares for us
[2779.64 --> 2780.64]  his mind is honest
[2780.64 --> 2783.64]  his mind is full of thoughts of us
[2784.64 --> 2786.64]  the one who created everything that exists
[2786.64 --> 2788.64]  he cares for you and for me
[2788.64 --> 2791.64]  many of you will know that
[2791.64 --> 2795.64]  Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of Britain
[2795.64 --> 2797.64]  back during World War II
[2797.64 --> 2800.64]  when his country was under attack by Nazi Germany
[2800.64 --> 2803.64]  and every night at the beginning of the war
[2803.64 --> 2805.64]  in what is known as the Blitz
[2805.64 --> 2807.64]  Nazi planes would fly over London
[2807.64 --> 2809.64]  and they would just drop hundreds and hundreds of bombs on the city
[2809.64 --> 2811.64]  every night
[2811.64 --> 2815.64]  and they would drop bombs particularly on the east end of the city
[2815.64 --> 2820.64]  and that is because that is where you know many of the vital war industries
[2820.64 --> 2822.64]  that Britain needed to survive were there
[2822.64 --> 2827.64]  but it was also home to some of the poorest residents
[2827.64 --> 2829.64]  of the entire city the east end
[2830.64 --> 2832.64]  and so tens of thousands of people who lived there
[2832.64 --> 2837.64]  lost everything as their homes were flattened and destroyed by the bombs
[2837.64 --> 2841.64]  and so every night the bombers would descend on the city
[2841.64 --> 2844.64]  and the residents of the east end would hear the sirens
[2844.64 --> 2846.64]  and they would be forced to flee underground
[2846.64 --> 2848.64]  seeking shelter down in the subway
[2848.64 --> 2852.64]  where they would have to endure yet another awful night
[2852.64 --> 2854.64]  and then the dawn would come
[2854.64 --> 2855.64]  the skies would clear
[2855.64 --> 2858.64]  and the people would come up out of the subways
[2858.64 --> 2860.64]  and they would look around to see what was going on
[2860.64 --> 2867.64]  and one when they did one thing they saw that was really interesting is this
[2867.64 --> 2873.64]  oftentimes they're walking amongst the rubble in the debris
[2873.64 --> 2877.64]  was their Prime Minister Winston Churchill
[2877.64 --> 2882.64]  right as soon as Churchill's car delivered him to the scene of destruction
[2882.64 --> 2884.64]  he would jump out on foot
[2884.64 --> 2887.64]  he would you know climb around
[2887.64 --> 2890.64]  he would poke at the edges of the crater with his walking stick
[2890.64 --> 2893.64]  he would scramble up onto piles of rubble
[2893.64 --> 2895.64]  for a better view of the damage
[2895.64 --> 2898.64]  he would charge down the streets through puddles
[2898.64 --> 2901.64]  through rubble over fallen bricks
[2901.64 --> 2906.64]  always seeking out the people
[2906.64 --> 2910.64]  he always sought out the people of the east end
[2910.64 --> 2912.64]  because he wanted to be with them
[2912.64 --> 2915.64]  right he wanted to listen to them to hear their stories
[2915.64 --> 2917.64]  hear their their troubles
[2917.64 --> 2919.64]  he wanted to encourage them
[2919.64 --> 2921.64]  give them solace for the days ahead
[2921.64 --> 2924.64]  and isn't that fascinating
[2924.64 --> 2928.64]  right that even though he's got this world war to direct
[2928.64 --> 2932.64]  and even though he's got plans and strategies to talk about with his generals
[2932.64 --> 2934.64]  where was Churchill?
[2934.64 --> 2938.64]  He was walking among the people of East and London
[2938.64 --> 2941.64]  to see how they were doing
[2941.64 --> 2947.64]  right his mind was filled with concern for the people
[2947.64 --> 2952.64]  and in the same way God is concerned about us
[2952.64 --> 2955.64]  he has his mind set on us
[2955.64 --> 2958.64]  right and certainly God has a universe to run
[2958.64 --> 2962.64]  right he's got millions of stars and planets to direct
[2962.64 --> 2968.64]  but at the same time we need to remember that God is actively focused on us
[2968.64 --> 2972.64]  and so I think that's something that God wants us
[2972.64 --> 2975.64]  you and me to know this morning
[2975.64 --> 2977.64]  is that he is paying attention to you
[2977.64 --> 2981.64]  you know and even as the the bombs kind of metaphorically
[2981.64 --> 2984.64]  right are falling in your life
[2984.64 --> 2987.64]  and we find ourselves in places that are hard
[2987.64 --> 2992.64]  we're struggling with you know maybe our with money or our family
[2992.64 --> 2996.64]  our kids our health with fears and anxieties
[2996.64 --> 2998.64]  all this stuff that we are facing
[2998.64 --> 3000.64]  he is paying attention
[3001.64 --> 3004.64]  you know and certainly when we think about the grand scheme of things
[3004.64 --> 3008.64]  who are we like what you know is my life's kind of seems like small potatoes
[3009.64 --> 3010.64]  but not to God
[3011.64 --> 3012.64]  he cares for us
[3012.64 --> 3015.64]  and so you know as we take that verse
[3015.64 --> 3018.64]  verse 4
[3018.64 --> 3020.64]  what is man that you are mindful of him
[3020.64 --> 3022.64]  the son of man that you care for him
[3023.64 --> 3025.64]  I want to encourage you to meditate on that
[3025.64 --> 3027.64]  and then even make it first person
[3027.64 --> 3029.64]  so it says something like this
[3029.64 --> 3032.64]  who am I that you are mindful of me
[3033.64 --> 3038.64]  who am I that you care for me
[3038.64 --> 3040.64]  something to meditate on today
[3041.64 --> 3043.64]  now that leads us to our third point
[3043.64 --> 3044.64]  about what it means to be a human being
[3045.64 --> 3047.64]  right not only are we worshipers
[3047.64 --> 3049.64]  not only are we weak yet cared for
[3050.64 --> 3053.64]  the third thing is that we are wonderful
[3054.64 --> 3055.64]  we are wonderful
[3055.64 --> 3056.64]  you are wonderful
[3056.64 --> 3057.64]  did you know that
[3057.64 --> 3059.64]  you know sometimes pastors like to do this thing
[3059.64 --> 3060.64]  it's kind of cheesy
[3060.64 --> 3062.64]  but turn to the person next to you and say
[3062.64 --> 3063.64]  you are wonderful
[3063.64 --> 3064.64]  let's just do it come on
[3064.64 --> 3069.64]  see now don't you feel so much better
[3071.64 --> 3072.64]  alright
[3073.64 --> 3075.64]  so in verses 2 to 4
[3076.64 --> 3078.64]  you know verses 2 to 4 speak about our humility
[3079.64 --> 3080.64]  our weakness as humans
[3081.64 --> 3084.64]  verses 5 to 8 then highlight our glory
[3085.64 --> 3087.64]  verse 5 says this
[3087.64 --> 3090.64]  you have made them a little lower than the angels
[3091.64 --> 3092.64]  and crown them with glory and honor
[3092.64 --> 3095.64]  right so what is this glory
[3095.64 --> 3097.64]  what is this what does it mean that we are made
[3097.64 --> 3098.64]  lower than the angels
[3099.64 --> 3101.64]  well this is a reference back to the book of Genesis
[3102.64 --> 3104.64]  God revealed at the very beginning of the Bible
[3105.64 --> 3107.64]  that we as human beings are something special
[3108.64 --> 3111.64]  that we are made in the image of God
[3112.64 --> 3115.64]  out of the thousands of species and creatures that God made
[3115.64 --> 3119.64]  human beings are made with a unique glory and honor
[3119.64 --> 3123.64]  and it's not intrinsic to ourselves but God has crowned us with it
[3124.64 --> 3127.64]  we are made in the image of a glorious God
[3128.64 --> 3133.64]  and then verse 6 it tells us what it means that we are made in his image
[3133.64 --> 3135.64]  oftentimes we say what does it mean that we're made in the image of God
[3136.64 --> 3137.64]  well verse 6 tells us
[3138.64 --> 3140.64]  you made them rulers over the works of your hands
[3141.64 --> 3142.64]  you put everything under their feet
[3143.64 --> 3145.64]  that's what it means that we're made in God's image
[3145.64 --> 3147.64]  that we are made vice regents
[3148.64 --> 3150.64]  we are made co-rulers with God
[3151.64 --> 3154.64]  so what is your purpose as a human being
[3155.64 --> 3157.64]  it is to rule over God's works
[3158.64 --> 3161.64]  God is the king he is the ruler ruler of everything
[3162.64 --> 3163.64]  all the works of his fingers
[3164.64 --> 3167.64]  but he has made us to share in that rule with him
[3167.64 --> 3171.64]  of cultivating and of caring for this world
[3172.64 --> 3174.64]  and so what does it mean to rule over creation
[3175.64 --> 3178.64]  now we could I mean we can say all kinds of things
[3178.64 --> 3179.64]  we do a whole series on that question
[3180.64 --> 3182.64]  but at its most basic idea
[3183.64 --> 3184.64]  it means simply this
[3185.64 --> 3186.64]  it means to promote the law of God
[3187.64 --> 3190.64]  in those spheres that the Lord has entrusted to you
[3191.64 --> 3194.64]  hey to promote the law of God just in those spheres
[3194.64 --> 3197.64]  wherever that God has entrusted it to you
[3198.64 --> 3199.64]  whether it's in your household
[3200.64 --> 3201.64]  or your family
[3202.64 --> 3204.64]  your friendships or your job or your church
[3206.64 --> 3208.64]  and so part of what it means to be a human being
[3209.64 --> 3212.64]  is that every single human being by virtue of being human
[3213.64 --> 3215.64]  we each one of us have agency
[3216.64 --> 3218.64]  you have power so to speak
[3219.64 --> 3220.64]  now a lot of us will say
[3220.64 --> 3221.64]  oh you know I don't have that much power
[3221.64 --> 3223.64]  I'm kind of weak
[3224.64 --> 3227.64]  but every single one of us has agency
[3228.64 --> 3230.64]  we have a measure of rule and power
[3231.64 --> 3233.64]  no matter who we are no matter how much it is
[3234.64 --> 3235.64]  and that means most importantly
[3236.64 --> 3238.64]  that every single human being is accountable to God
[3239.64 --> 3242.64]  what for whatever God has given us to rule over
[3243.64 --> 3245.64]  and for each one of us at the very least it means ourselves
[3246.64 --> 3248.64]  okay we are to be self-controlled
[3248.64 --> 3250.64]  we are to rule over ourselves
[3251.64 --> 3253.64]  that is what God has given us dominion over
[3254.64 --> 3257.64]  and so the emphasis of the scriptures is always to be faithful
[3258.64 --> 3261.64]  with whatever little agency we have to be co-rulers with God
[3262.64 --> 3265.64]  and then we are invited always to turn to God in prayer
[3266.64 --> 3268.64]  and then trust for the Lord to help us
[3269.64 --> 3273.64]  because he is power his power his agency is unlimited
[3273.64 --> 3278.64]  so that friends is according to Psalm 8 the answer to the question
[3279.64 --> 3280.64]  what is mankind
[3281.64 --> 3282.64]  the answer is we are worshipers
[3283.64 --> 3284.64]  we are made to worship God
[3285.64 --> 3286.64]  we are weak
[3287.64 --> 3288.64]  a little dot and a little dot
[3289.64 --> 3290.64]  but we are deeply cared for by God
[3291.64 --> 3293.64]  and we are wonderfully made in God's image
[3294.64 --> 3296.64]  we are crowned with glory and honor and dignity
[3297.64 --> 3298.64]  right isn't that
[3299.64 --> 3300.64]  a mystery
[3300.64 --> 3301.64]  a mystery
[3301.64 --> 3302.64]  who God has made us
[3303.64 --> 3304.64]  and it's a joy
[3305.64 --> 3306.64]  it's the joy that is ours of being human beings
[3307.64 --> 3308.64]  but before we end
[3309.64 --> 3314.64]  there is one more essential fact about being human that we find in Hebrews chapter 2
[3315.64 --> 3316.64]  that we read earlier
[3317.64 --> 3318.64]  think of it as a bonus point
[3319.64 --> 3320.64]  point bonus
[3321.64 --> 3322.64]  aren't you excited?
[3323.64 --> 3324.64]  I know you are
[3325.64 --> 3326.64]  how does Hebrews 2 answer the question
[3326.64 --> 3327.64]  what is mankind?
[3327.64 --> 3328.64]  well remember
[3329.64 --> 3330.64]  so Hebrews
[3331.64 --> 3332.64]  the book of Hebrews chapter 1 right out of the gate
[3333.64 --> 3335.64]  it quotes Psalm 8
[3336.64 --> 3341.64]  to show us that Jesus is the true and ideal human being
[3342.64 --> 3344.64]  he was made a little lower than the angels
[3345.64 --> 3347.64]  when he became a man he took on human form
[3348.64 --> 3350.64]  he became a weak human like us
[3351.64 --> 3356.64]  and all throughout his life he worshiped God first and foremost
[3357.64 --> 3359.64]  and he took on our humility
[3360.64 --> 3361.64]  he knew God's care for him
[3362.64 --> 3363.64]  he knew the glory in which he was created
[3364.64 --> 3365.64]  and then because of his death and resurrection
[3366.64 --> 3368.64]  it says God the Father has crowned him
[3369.64 --> 3370.64]  giving him the name that is above every name
[3371.64 --> 3375.64]  he is the Lord whose name is majestic in all the earth
[3375.64 --> 3378.64]  and why did Jesus become a man?
[3378.64 --> 3380.64]  why did he take on our humanity?
[3381.64 --> 3383.64]  listen to what it says in verse 9
[3384.64 --> 3389.64]  but we do see Jesus who was made lower than the angels for a little while
[3390.64 --> 3393.64]  now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death
[3394.64 --> 3401.64]  note this so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone
[3401.64 --> 3405.64]  so the final thing we learn about what it means to be human
[3406.64 --> 3410.64]  is that we, point four, are in need of God's grace
[3411.64 --> 3413.64]  that we are recipients of God's grace
[3414.64 --> 3418.64]  to be human is to stand in need of the grace of God
[3419.64 --> 3424.64]  you see we live less than human lives so often
[3425.64 --> 3426.64]  so often that is our default
[3426.64 --> 3429.64]  God made us to worship him
[3430.64 --> 3431.64]  to praise his glory
[3432.64 --> 3434.64]  but the scriptures say that we have fallen short of the glory of God
[3435.64 --> 3437.64]  that is what sin is and does
[3438.64 --> 3443.64]  and to fall short of God's glory is actually to fall short of our humanity
[3444.64 --> 3445.64]  which is the image of God
[3446.64 --> 3450.64]  you see we live in a universe where the glory of God is rightly at the center of the whole universe
[3451.64 --> 3452.64]  and everything revolves around that
[3452.64 --> 3459.64]  but every one of us foolishly pretend that the universe revolves around us
[3460.64 --> 3461.64]  right?
[3462.64 --> 3463.64]  I am the main character in the story
[3464.64 --> 3466.64]  I am the measure of all things
[3467.64 --> 3471.64]  and when we live like that we don't live according to our humanity
[3472.64 --> 3473.64]  the way that God has made us
[3474.64 --> 3477.64]  but when we acknowledge and confess that we need God's grace
[3477.64 --> 3480.64]  because of the ways that we fall short of the way God made us
[3480.64 --> 3482.64]  that's when we actually become truly human
[3483.64 --> 3486.64]  because God made us to be recipients of his grace
[3487.64 --> 3491.64]  and so if who we are as humans is to be in need of grace
[3492.64 --> 3495.64]  then who God is, is he is the giver of grace
[3496.64 --> 3498.64]  God is the giver of grace, it's who he is
[3499.64 --> 3501.64]  friends that's the gospel for our humanity
[3502.64 --> 3503.64]  let's pray together
[3503.64 --> 3509.64]  our Father we do confess to you that we have fallen short of
[3510.64 --> 3511.64]  our humanity
[3512.64 --> 3515.64]  that you have created us to possess and own and be
[3516.64 --> 3518.64]  because we have fallen short of your glory
[3519.64 --> 3522.64]  but we thank you that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of Psalm 8
[3523.64 --> 3524.64]  we thank you
[3525.64 --> 3528.64]  that he came and he lived a fully perfect human life
[3528.64 --> 3532.64]  and that he died in our place so that his righteousness could be ours
[3533.64 --> 3534.64]  and that we are united to him
[3535.64 --> 3537.64]  and we stand in union with Christ
[3538.64 --> 3539.64]  and that through him
[3540.64 --> 3542.64]  we can be once again who you've made us to be
[3543.64 --> 3545.64]  we thank you that you are mindful of us and that you care for us
[3546.64 --> 3548.64]  and Lord would you make us more humble
[3549.64 --> 3551.64]  more oriented to your glory and not our own
[3552.64 --> 3553.64]  we pray this in Christ's name
[3554.64 --> 3555.64]  Amen
[3555.64 --> 3562.64]  okay let's all stand and let's sing our next song our song of response
[3562.64 --> 3571.64]  who has held the oceans
[3572.64 --> 3583.64]  who has held the oceans
[3583.64 --> 3594.26]  Who has held the oceans in his hands?
[3594.76 --> 3599.94]  Who has now burned every grain of sand?
[3599.94 --> 3605.74]  Kings and nations tremble at his voice.
[3606.16 --> 3611.76]  All creation rises to rejoice.
[3611.76 --> 3620.22]  Behold our God seated on his throne.
[3620.22 --> 3624.18]  Come let us adore him.
[3624.58 --> 3628.22]  Behold our King.
[3629.24 --> 3631.22]  Nothing can compare.
[3632.14 --> 3637.22]  Come let us adore him.
[3641.76 --> 3647.22]  Who has given counsel to the Lord?
[3648.22 --> 3653.48]  Who can question any of his words?
[3654.02 --> 3659.14]  Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[3659.14 --> 3665.60]  Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?
[3665.60 --> 3674.06]  Behold our God seated on his throne.
[3674.06 --> 3678.06]  Come let us adore him.
[3678.52 --> 3682.06]  Behold our King.
[3683.06 --> 3685.06]  Nothing can compare.
[3685.06 --> 3691.52]  Come let us adore him.
[3691.52 --> 3707.40]  Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
[3707.40 --> 3712.98]  Bearing all the guilt of sinful man.
[3713.86 --> 3718.94]  God eternal, humble to the grave.
[3719.54 --> 3725.86]  Jesus, Savior, risen now to lay.
[3725.86 --> 3730.32]  Behold our King.
[3730.32 --> 3733.66]  Behold our God seated on his throne.
[3734.32 --> 3737.54]  Come let us adore him.
[3738.32 --> 3742.14]  Behold our King.
[3742.32 --> 3744.32]  Nothing can compare.
[3744.32 --> 3750.32]  Come let us adore him.
[3750.32 --> 3780.30]  Come let us adore him.
[3780.32 --> 3782.32]  Come let us adore him.
[3791.78 --> 3798.48]  So let us continue to worship and glorify God by bringing an offering into his courts.
[3798.48 --> 3806.96]  So we come to give a bit of what God has given us in the offering of our tithes and offerings to the work of his kingdom.
[3807.24 --> 3811.78]  So may I invite our deacons to come and collect the morning offering.
[3811.78 --> 3813.78]  And do we have a...
[3813.78 --> 3815.06]  It is there.
[3816.50 --> 3818.82]  So you can see what our designated cause is.
[3819.16 --> 3823.38]  It's for the Johnson family who does their work amongst First Nations people.
[3823.38 --> 3828.38]  We are going to introduce a new song to you during this time.
[3828.50 --> 3829.72]  It's called the Lord's Prayer.
[3830.14 --> 3831.24]  And it's the Lord's Prayer.
[3831.48 --> 3834.24]  So feel free to just sit and listen and enjoy.
[3834.44 --> 3839.30]  And if you feel comfortable and want to join in, we won't have the words up, but you'll know the words.
[3839.30 --> 3856.52]  We
[3856.52 --> 3881.34]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[3882.06 --> 3884.94]  Father, let your will be done.
[3884.94 --> 3891.74]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[3892.26 --> 3895.30]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[3895.96 --> 3898.82]  Father, let your will be done.
[3899.42 --> 3905.64]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[3906.50 --> 3910.14]  Give us this day your daily bread.
[3910.14 --> 3913.36]  Forgive us, forgive us.
[3913.56 --> 3918.52]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us.
[3919.00 --> 3920.18]  Forgive them.
[3920.68 --> 3924.36]  And lead us not into temptation.
[3924.86 --> 3930.32]  But deliver us from the evil ones.
[3930.32 --> 3933.86]  Let your kingdom come.
[3934.36 --> 3937.16]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[3937.86 --> 3940.68]  Father, let your will be done.
[3940.68 --> 3947.58]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[3947.58 --> 3951.12]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[3951.80 --> 3954.66]  Father, let your will be done.
[3954.66 --> 3961.54]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[3962.54 --> 3965.96]  Give us this day your daily bread.
[3966.10 --> 3969.14]  Forgive us, forgive us.
[3969.14 --> 3974.36]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us.
[3974.36 --> 3975.36]  Forgive them.
[3975.36 --> 3975.94]  Forgive them.
[3975.94 --> 3980.18]  And lead us not into temptation.
[3980.68 --> 3986.06]  But deliver us from the evil one.
[3986.94 --> 3989.64]  Let your kingdom come.
[3989.64 --> 4014.78]  Forever and ever.
[4014.78 --> 4018.12]  The kingdom is yours.
[4018.12 --> 4019.90]  It's yours.
[4019.90 --> 4021.68]  It's yours.
[4021.68 --> 4023.40]  All yours.
[4023.52 --> 4025.08]  All yours.
[4025.22 --> 4026.64]  The kingdom.
[4027.22 --> 4028.36]  The power.
[4028.94 --> 4030.26]  The glory.
[4030.70 --> 4031.84]  All yours.
[4032.30 --> 4033.58]  It's yours.
[4033.84 --> 4035.28]  It's yours.
[4035.58 --> 4036.98]  All yours.
[4037.40 --> 4038.68]  All yours.
[4039.14 --> 4042.02]  Forever and ever.
[4042.02 --> 4045.20]  The kingdom is yours.
[4045.52 --> 4047.80]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[4048.58 --> 4051.36]  Father, let your will be done.
[4052.06 --> 4058.24]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[4058.94 --> 4061.66]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[4062.36 --> 4065.12]  Father, let your will be done.
[4065.80 --> 4071.94]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[4072.68 --> 4079.02]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[4088.58 --> 4089.60]  Great song.
[4090.36 --> 4091.62]  I'm glad we're going to do that one.
[4091.62 --> 4093.86]  All right.
[4093.90 --> 4101.40]  Well, it's very appropriate then that in light of that, Father, let your kingdom come, that we go to him in prayer, asking for his kingdom to come.
[4101.92 --> 4105.50]  And so actually we'll pray and we will conclude with the Lord's prayer.
[4105.50 --> 4113.88]  And one thing we're going to really pray for today is maybe some of you have heard, but Kukuye has had quite a bad accident.
[4114.08 --> 4116.76]  And he is in VGH hospital.
[4117.60 --> 4118.84]  He'll be there for a couple of weeks.
[4118.84 --> 4126.56]  And so we really do need to lift up him in prayer and also his family, Salem, and his children.
[4127.22 --> 4129.98]  And so let's pray for God's mercy.
[4129.98 --> 4144.68]  Our Father and our God, we know you as the majestic one, the holy one, as the God over all the earth.
[4144.68 --> 4148.68]  There is no such thing as God's.
[4148.86 --> 4152.16]  There is only you, the one true and living God.
[4153.10 --> 4155.78]  And Lord, we acknowledge that and we praise you.
[4155.78 --> 4164.90]  And because of who you are, the God over all things, we come to you in prayer, knowing our own weakness, our own limitations.
[4165.10 --> 4166.44]  We can't control what happens.
[4167.42 --> 4173.46]  So, Lord, we look to you whose power, whose agency is unlimited.
[4175.64 --> 4183.44]  So, Lord, we plead with you this morning to end the suffering that we experience in this world.
[4183.44 --> 4187.52]  Lord, we know you use our suffering for your purposes in our lives.
[4188.28 --> 4190.92]  But, Lord, it's not the way you also created things to be.
[4191.08 --> 4193.52]  And you will bring all tears and suffering to an end.
[4194.12 --> 4201.62]  So, Lord, we pray for your kingdom to come to end the suffering that we experience in our lives with your return.
[4201.94 --> 4207.60]  Lord, we pray even now, though, that as the God of peace, that you would bring peace on this earth.
[4207.60 --> 4217.76]  We pray, Lord, for peace into the end of war and all the different wars happening, whether it's in Ukraine or Israel or in Africa, in different places.
[4218.70 --> 4220.82]  Lord, we pray for your reign of peace to come.
[4221.76 --> 4225.30]  Lord, we plead with you also the God who fashioned and made us.
[4226.14 --> 4228.74]  And the God who is mindful of us and cares for us.
[4229.34 --> 4232.58]  Lord, we pray for your mercy upon Kukue.
[4232.58 --> 4238.52]  We pray that you would heal him from the accident that he suffered a few days ago.
[4238.76 --> 4247.06]  We pray that the doctors would be able to, that you would work through them, through surgery, through medicine, to bring him to healing.
[4247.84 --> 4256.04]  And, Lord, we ask that you would be with Salem and their children in the midst of fears and anxieties,
[4256.04 --> 4264.62]  worries about him and about their future and about how you will provide and about what will happen and all these questions.
[4264.76 --> 4268.84]  Lord, would you be an ever-present help in a time of trouble?
[4270.46 --> 4276.08]  We pray also, Lord, for your protection and love for our children, our grandchildren,
[4276.08 --> 4280.36]  as they transition from the school year into summer holidays.
[4280.36 --> 4290.28]  Lord, would you give children a time to rest, a time to be with family and friends and to enjoy your world and your creation.
[4291.20 --> 4296.22]  Most of all, Lord, give them the grace to enjoy you, to know you even more.
[4297.24 --> 4306.64]  Lord, we pray for your grace, for the growth of our church, our growth in holiness, our growth in your grace,
[4307.02 --> 4308.84]  our growth as we reach out to others.
[4308.84 --> 4317.82]  We ask that your spirit would be at work in our lives, that you would draw us to yourself, to be your servants in this world.
[4318.88 --> 4325.70]  We thank you, Lord, for hearing these and all of our prayers, even the ones that are heavy on our hearts,
[4325.78 --> 4328.10]  that we speak to you in this time.
[4328.64 --> 4330.66]  We thank you for meeting all of our needs.
[4331.30 --> 4336.20]  And we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who taught us to pray, saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4336.20 --> 4341.04]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4341.62 --> 4346.16]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4346.84 --> 4354.54]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4355.04 --> 4359.00]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4359.00 --> 4364.76]  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever.
[4365.34 --> 4365.78]  Amen.
[4367.04 --> 4376.40]  Let's stand, and we go forth with God's blessings upon us, and join us for a time of fellowship in the coffee hall, the fellowship hall.
[4376.64 --> 4378.50]  We have a whole room for coffee in this church.
[4378.84 --> 4381.60]  No, just the fellowship hall over there.
[4381.60 --> 4385.08]  So stretch forth your hands to receive God's good blessing upon you.
[4385.86 --> 4391.68]  Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great shepherd of the sheep,
[4392.06 --> 4397.16]  by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will,
[4397.50 --> 4404.92]  working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory both now and forevermore.
[4405.32 --> 4405.62]  Amen.
[4405.62 --> 4405.74]  Amen.
[4411.60 --> 4434.54]  My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior.
[4434.54 --> 4447.86]  My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4447.86 --> 4458.02]  To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever.
[4458.02 --> 4459.14]  Amen.
[4459.14 --> 4470.74]  To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever.

[4471.90 --> 4485.52]  My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior.
[4485.52 --> 4499.40]  My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4499.40 --> 4509.24]  To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever.
[4509.24 --> 4510.40]  Amen.
[4510.40 --> 4518.78]  To God be the glory, now and forever.
[4518.78 --> 4522.00]  Now and forever.
[4522.00 --> 4523.22]  Amen.
[4523.22 --> 4523.78]  Amen.
[4523.78 --> 4525.22]  Amen.
[4525.22 --> 4527.22]  Amen.
[4527.22 --> 4529.22]  Amen.
[4529.22 --> 4531.22]  Amen.
[4531.22 --> 4533.22]  Amen.
[4533.22 --> 4535.22]  Amen.
[4535.22 --> 4537.22]  Amen.
[4537.22 --> 4538.22]  Amen.
