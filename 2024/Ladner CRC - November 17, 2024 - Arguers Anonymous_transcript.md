[450.00 --> 452.00]  Amen.
[480.00 --> 481.16]  Good morning.
[481.16 --> 482.16]  Good morning.
[482.16 --> 486.00]  It's nice to see you this morning on this Lord's Day.
[487.00 --> 489.36]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[489.46 --> 490.24]  My name is Jason.
[490.54 --> 492.16]  I am one of the pastors here.
[492.78 --> 495.18]  And it's my privilege to welcome you.
[495.36 --> 499.58]  And especially if you are new this morning, joining us for the first time, we are especially
[499.58 --> 500.88]  glad that you are here.
[501.50 --> 509.32]  For all those joining online, and all of you, also regular people of our congregation, welcome
[509.32 --> 509.78]  this morning.
[510.00 --> 512.86]  So just a few announcements as we begin.
[513.28 --> 516.98]  I hope you were able to get a bulletin as we came into the doors.
[517.80 --> 524.12]  There is one correction that I am to make under bereavement.
[525.10 --> 528.78]  It is, the right name is Gerda.
[529.18 --> 531.80]  Now I don't know Gerda, but I think many of you do.
[532.02 --> 534.10]  She is well known amongst the congregation here.
[534.10 --> 541.18]  But Gerda Bosma went into glory this past Thursday.
[541.64 --> 546.12]  So we'll pray for her family and her friends, for those of you who knew her especially.
[546.12 --> 555.46]  Also, another thing, there are some Christmas cards made by Marian Vandriel that are available
[555.46 --> 556.94]  on the foyer table.
[557.10 --> 564.10]  Now these are for sale, but the proceeds go to Hannah, who is the missionary that we support
[564.10 --> 566.32]  working in Greece, Hannah Vanderkamp.
[566.76 --> 571.52]  So if you would like to support her work in Greece and also get yourself some Christmas
[571.52 --> 574.42]  cards for the upcoming season, this is a great opportunity.
[574.42 --> 578.50]  So you can sign up on the foyer table to purchase one of the cards that are there.
[578.50 --> 586.72]  The last thing I have to say is that we are coming up on the Advent season.
[587.12 --> 592.70]  One of the things that we do as a church is we will have our Advent wreath with our candles
[592.70 --> 593.42]  up front.
[594.20 --> 597.92]  And oftentimes, it's the worship committee and we sit around and say, oh, who should we
[597.92 --> 598.54]  ask?
[599.04 --> 603.04]  But we thought, you know, what if we're missing someone who really wants to do it?
[603.82 --> 608.48]  And so we would love to give you the opportunity, if you would like to be involved in this
[608.50 --> 613.68]  and lighting the candle and doing the reading to sign up and to be involved.
[614.28 --> 615.98]  And so there's a sign-up sheet on the foyer table.
[616.68 --> 620.70]  There's a few spots that you can write down for each Sunday.
[620.92 --> 626.84]  So there's five times the four Sundays of Advent plus Christmas Day when we will have
[626.84 --> 627.54]  a candle lighting.
[628.02 --> 632.26]  And so you can sign up as maybe a family or some friends together.
[632.60 --> 635.36]  You could put your names down and do this together.
[635.36 --> 640.28]  So please do give that some thought and attention and sign up for the Advent candle readings.
[640.90 --> 643.28]  Now, we have two additional announcements this morning.
[643.42 --> 646.66]  First, I'll ask Elaine to come up and share about Faith Promise Giving.
[647.28 --> 649.44]  And following her, Joe, you can come up as well.
[651.44 --> 651.84]  Yes.
[651.84 --> 652.84]  Yes.
[662.66 --> 663.96]  So that will be one of the announcements.
[664.12 --> 665.64]  We'll give some more clarification to that.
[667.38 --> 667.78]  Right.
[667.90 --> 678.12]  And so the service in Alberta, jumping ahead, is at 1.30 in Alberta, which is 12.30 here.
[678.12 --> 678.56]  Yeah.
[678.78 --> 680.94]  So we'll actually be gathering at 12.15.
[681.82 --> 683.78]  And that's just so that I can welcome you and pray.
[684.72 --> 688.92]  And then we will join the live stream that starts for us at 12.30.
[690.26 --> 694.14]  So we'll be watching it live as it takes place at 1.30 in Alberta.
[694.86 --> 695.06]  Okay.
[695.22 --> 695.60]  But Elaine.
[695.60 --> 695.66]  Elaine.
[704.98 --> 706.10]  Good morning, everybody.
[708.12 --> 715.64]  The deacons have placed our yearly Faith Promise Giving Letter in pledge form in your mailboxes today.
[717.10 --> 731.00]  We've been doing this for several years and are thankful for your prayerful contributions to our ministry here at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[731.00 --> 738.60]  We're blessed to be able to support our pastors, ministries, and programs run within Ladner CRC.
[739.54 --> 744.70]  We're also blessed to be able to support day-to-day operations of the church.
[746.38 --> 753.96]  Ladner CRC has always been a very faithful and giving church, and we've always been able to meet our needs.
[753.96 --> 763.72]  We ask that everyone please complete the Faith Promise Giving Pledge Form, even if you have not done so in the past.
[763.72 --> 771.00]  Please prayerfully reflect on how you can support Ladner CRC before filling out the pledge form.
[771.00 --> 782.06]  We understand the financial difficulties that many people are experiencing, so please only give what you are comfortable with and able to give.
[782.98 --> 788.00]  We will collect the completed forms in three weeks on December 8th.
[788.00 --> 794.74]  Thank you for your faithfulness to and support of God's work at Ladner CRC.
[794.74 --> 796.34]  Thanks.
[818.00 --> 819.00]  Thank you.
[819.00 --> 820.00]  Thank you.
[820.00 --> 827.74]  As a congregation and individually, we continue to mourn the sudden passing of Ernst Tavries,
[827.74 --> 837.56]  a much-loved friend, long-time Ladner CRC congregant, ministry leader, and associate pastor last Sunday morning.
[838.22 --> 846.88]  Many people have been and are continue to be deeply touched by Ernst and Winnie,
[846.88 --> 851.34]  and their long-standing deep past with us,
[851.82 --> 855.64]  and we now mourn alongside of Winnie and her family.
[857.36 --> 861.06]  Some of you and your leadership
[861.06 --> 866.84]  and people even from outside of our church congregation
[866.84 --> 871.72]  have wondered out loud if there was any way, as a church,
[871.72 --> 877.16]  we could be part of a memorial service for Ernst here in Ladner.
[878.72 --> 881.20]  With the help of Doug Van Ryan
[881.20 --> 886.20]  and from Sunrise CRC in Pinocca and their personnel,
[886.98 --> 889.44]  we've been able to set up a memorial service
[889.44 --> 893.76]  here at Ladner CRC for Saturday
[893.76 --> 900.20]  here in the sanctuary at 12.15, as was noted.
[900.20 --> 907.90]  We will tie into the livestream from Sunrise CRC in Pinocca at 12.30.
[908.94 --> 911.60]  That's 1.30 Mountain Standard Time,
[912.18 --> 917.28]  after Pastor Jason opens our service here.
[918.44 --> 920.60]  Please join us.
[922.20 --> 924.32]  Anyone who knew Ernst and Winnie,
[925.10 --> 929.18]  help us to share this time and support Winnie and the family
[929.18 --> 931.90]  even from a distance.
[933.40 --> 938.88]  Winnie knows this is planned and has voiced just how appreciative she is
[938.88 --> 942.08]  and thankful she is and the family are
[942.08 --> 945.92]  to Ladner CRC.
[946.98 --> 951.12]  We're reminded, come with your singing voices.
[951.12 --> 961.84]  Anyone who knew and has witnessed Ernst singing in this facility knows he always sang with gust
[961.84 --> 967.82]  and loudly, and we all knew he was here.
[967.82 --> 970.64]  So please, come with your singing voices.
[970.64 --> 980.52]  Also, we will send off an appropriate floral arrangement to Pinocca from this congregation.
[980.52 --> 985.14]  The cost for this will be borne by this church.
[985.92 --> 992.56]  However, some have indicated that they were considering sending floral arrangements
[992.56 --> 999.86]  and or certainly wanted to be a part and feel a part of any floral arrangement that would be sent.
[1000.28 --> 1004.60]  So, although you don't have to, if you wish to contribute,
[1004.88 --> 1011.82]  there is a small blue box on the foyer table that you can place a donation into if you wish.
[1011.82 --> 1022.70]  Also on the foyer table is a card that we wish to send to Winnie and the De Vries family
[1022.70 --> 1027.74]  as part of our sending the floral arrangement as well.
[1029.04 --> 1036.20]  Everyone here is encouraged to sign that card and or if there's not enough room on the card,
[1036.20 --> 1043.92]  there's some attached cards that will go with the card, please sign it, put on some comments if you wish.
[1044.86 --> 1045.66]  Please do that.
[1047.60 --> 1055.74]  Winnie has asked me in advance of what will take place this week to say that she and her entire family
[1055.74 --> 1059.74]  thank the people of Ladner CRC for all of our support
[1059.74 --> 1065.42]  and that they've genuinely felt
[1065.42 --> 1069.64]  and at this difficult time for them, obviously.
[1070.66 --> 1073.42]  She and they covet our prayers
[1073.42 --> 1076.40]  and appreciate all of the tokens of grace
[1076.40 --> 1079.16]  that they have already received.
[1080.08 --> 1080.76]  Thank you.
[1080.76 --> 1081.76]  Thank you.
[1089.74 --> 1094.84]  Okay, that should be all of our announcements for the morning.
[1095.58 --> 1102.30]  And so all of that being said, God welcomes us this morning into his presence.
[1103.20 --> 1109.72]  He welcomes us to come and to sing our songs to him, to hear from him in his word,
[1110.08 --> 1114.04]  to respond to what he's doing in our lives and in the world.
[1114.04 --> 1120.10]  And I love this traditional welcome that says this,
[1120.22 --> 1123.00]  to all who are weary and long for rest,
[1123.50 --> 1126.38]  to all who mourn and long for comfort,
[1127.08 --> 1129.98]  to all who struggle and desire strength,
[1130.90 --> 1133.52]  to all who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[1134.32 --> 1136.64]  to all who sin and need a savior,
[1137.92 --> 1139.82]  you are in the right place.
[1139.82 --> 1144.24]  Okay, you are welcome here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1144.34 --> 1148.52]  So with that in mind, would you stand and join with me in hearing
[1148.52 --> 1153.72]  and responding to God's call to us to worship this morning from Psalm 24.
[1155.20 --> 1156.52]  We'll read it responsibly.
[1157.12 --> 1159.58]  The earth is the Lord's and everything in it,
[1159.64 --> 1161.70]  the world and all who live in it.
[1162.40 --> 1164.74]  For he founded it on the seas
[1164.74 --> 1167.46]  and established it on the waters.
[1167.46 --> 1170.26]  Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord,
[1170.82 --> 1173.06]  who may stand in his holy place.
[1173.80 --> 1177.10]  The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,
[1177.32 --> 1182.28]  who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god.
[1182.92 --> 1185.10]  They will receive blessing from the Lord
[1185.10 --> 1188.32]  and righteousness from God their Savior.
[1189.40 --> 1192.66]  Such is the generation of those who seek him,
[1193.20 --> 1196.36]  who seek your face, God of Jacob.
[1196.36 --> 1197.64]  Would you pray with me?
[1199.00 --> 1204.48]  Well, Lord, we thank you this morning for gathering us together in your name as we worship you.
[1205.22 --> 1210.10]  Father, we praise you for all that you have done for us in Jesus Christ.
[1210.30 --> 1214.60]  You have reconciled us to yourself through his life, death, and resurrection.
[1215.58 --> 1217.92]  Thank you, Lord, for naming us as your children,
[1218.54 --> 1220.56]  for setting your love upon us,
[1220.56 --> 1223.26]  for cleansing us and giving us pure hearts.
[1224.20 --> 1226.50]  Lord, for teaching us of your love for us,
[1227.36 --> 1229.22]  and for pursuing your lost sheep.
[1229.90 --> 1232.18]  Would you meet each one of us this morning
[1232.18 --> 1234.60]  so that we would leave here later
[1234.60 --> 1236.50]  changed by you
[1236.50 --> 1238.96]  and strengthened to follow you.
[1239.20 --> 1240.48]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1240.78 --> 1241.12]  Amen.
[1241.12 --> 1244.22]  Here are these words of greeting
[1244.22 --> 1247.64]  from 2 Thessalonians.
[1248.84 --> 1251.10]  Now may the Lord of peace himself
[1251.10 --> 1253.00]  give you peace at all times
[1253.00 --> 1254.66]  in every way.
[1255.24 --> 1256.74]  The Lord be with you.
[1257.48 --> 1259.12]  And also be with you.
[1259.20 --> 1260.66]  Let's turn to one another
[1260.66 --> 1261.90]  and greet one another
[1261.90 --> 1262.58]  in that peace.
[1262.58 --> 1262.66]  Amen.
[1290.66 --> 1309.00]  All right.
[1309.54 --> 1310.30]  Good greetings.
[1311.30 --> 1314.28]  And the scripture,
[1314.48 --> 1317.66]  part of the scripture that was in the Psalms
[1317.66 --> 1320.82]  was the earth and the Lord has created everything.
[1321.00 --> 1322.92]  And I just want to remind us all
[1322.92 --> 1325.86]  that there's nothing larger and bigger and greater
[1325.86 --> 1327.48]  than God himself.
[1327.78 --> 1329.72]  He holds the universe in his hand
[1329.72 --> 1333.44]  and it is something small compared to him.
[1333.64 --> 1336.26]  And the first two songs that we have
[1336.26 --> 1338.64]  for you, the worship team today,
[1339.20 --> 1341.80]  are mathematical worship songs.
[1341.98 --> 1344.38]  One, the first one is
[1344.38 --> 1345.96]  Oh for a Thousand Tongues.
[1345.96 --> 1347.60]  And God is so great
[1347.60 --> 1351.66]  that we need more than one tongue individually
[1351.66 --> 1354.64]  to just say we could say so much
[1354.64 --> 1356.04]  if we had more than one voice.
[1356.16 --> 1357.08]  And then followed this,
[1357.62 --> 1361.98]  we'll have 10,000 reasons to sing.
[1362.16 --> 1365.96]  So just embrace the grandeur of our God
[1365.96 --> 1369.26]  and bring your voice to the worship this morning
[1369.26 --> 1371.96]  and enjoy the sound of your neighbor
[1371.96 --> 1373.28]  and our assembly today.
[1373.28 --> 1395.16]  Oh for a Thousand Tongues to sing
[1395.16 --> 1399.44]  My great Redeemer's praise
[1399.44 --> 1404.00]  The glories of your God and dear
[1404.00 --> 1409.20]  Now to Him, so He is praise
[1409.20 --> 1414.34]  My great Redeemer's praise
[1414.34 --> 1419.04]  The glories of your God and dear
[1419.04 --> 1421.24]  The glories of your God and dear
[1421.24 --> 1421.78]  Now to Him, so He is
[1421.78 --> 1424.74]  The glories of your God and dear
[1424.74 --> 1439.08]  All ye are the glory of theinctions
[1439.08 --> 1443.48]  And I wish you to give by my sin
[1443.48 --> 1447.74]  And the land will use
[1447.74 --> 1452.50]  He makes the power of man's mercy
[1452.50 --> 1457.24]  He sets the prisoner free
[1457.24 --> 1461.80]  His broken name provides
[1461.80 --> 1467.08]  For the man for me
[1467.08 --> 1473.24]  He laid there, His praise be done
[1473.24 --> 1477.52]  Your birth and count and glory
[1477.52 --> 1482.50]  Here I behold, your Savior God
[1482.50 --> 1486.96]  And we will aim for joy
[1486.96 --> 1494.78]  In the earth and the power and praise and love
[1494.78 --> 1498.98]  We ever, ever give
[1498.98 --> 1504.44]  Christ sits below and sits above
[1504.44 --> 1510.78]  God's chosen and life will ever give
[1510.78 --> 1512.04]  Amen
[1524.78 --> 1528.98]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1528.98 --> 1531.76]  O my soul
[1531.76 --> 1536.44]  Worship His holy name
[1536.44 --> 1540.26]  Seek like never before
[1540.26 --> 1543.16]  O my soul
[1543.16 --> 1547.44]  I worship His holy name
[1547.44 --> 1553.90]  The sun comes up
[1553.90 --> 1556.70]  It's another day, darling
[1556.70 --> 1561.90]  It's time to say your songs again
[1561.90 --> 1565.14]  Look at her name, my son
[1565.14 --> 1567.64]  Whatever I need, darling
[1567.64 --> 1571.38]  Let me be singing
[1571.38 --> 1573.38]  Let me be singing
[1573.38 --> 1573.58]  Let me be singing
[1573.58 --> 1575.58]  Let me be singing
[1575.58 --> 1576.58]  Let me be singing
[1576.58 --> 1581.04]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1581.04 --> 1584.04]  Lord, my soul
[1584.04 --> 1588.58]  Worship His holy name
[1588.58 --> 1592.04]  Seek like never before
[1592.04 --> 1594.82]  O my soul
[1594.82 --> 1598.58]  I worship His holy name
[1598.58 --> 1605.24]  Your will is cherished love
[1605.24 --> 1608.46]  And your soul to anger
[1608.46 --> 1610.74]  Your name is great
[1610.74 --> 1613.66]  And your heart is kind
[1613.66 --> 1616.24]  O all your goodness
[1616.24 --> 1619.66]  I will keep on singing
[1619.66 --> 1622.76]  Ten thousand reasons
[1622.76 --> 1625.58]  I'm hard to hide
[1625.58 --> 1632.24]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1632.24 --> 1637.24]  I will worship His holy name
[1637.24 --> 1638.24]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1638.24 --> 1639.24]  I will worship His holy name
[1639.24 --> 1643.12]  Sing like never before
[1643.12 --> 1645.24]  O my soul
[1645.24 --> 1649.24]  I will worship His holy name
[1649.24 --> 1655.90]  And on that day
[1655.90 --> 1658.90]  When my strength is failing
[1658.90 --> 1660.90]  The end draws near
[1660.90 --> 1663.90]  And my time has come
[1663.90 --> 1665.90]  I will worship His holy name
[1665.90 --> 1667.90]  I will worship His holy name
[1667.90 --> 1670.56]  For praise on many
[1670.56 --> 1672.56]  Ten thousand reasons
[1672.56 --> 1673.56]  Ten thousand reasons
[1673.56 --> 1678.56]  I will worship His holy name
[1678.56 --> 1683.22]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1683.22 --> 1685.22]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1685.22 --> 1689.22]  I will worship His holy name
[1689.22 --> 1695.88]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1695.88 --> 1699.88]  I will worship His holy name
[1699.88 --> 1701.88]  Sing like never before
[1701.88 --> 1703.88]  O my soul, O my soul
[1703.88 --> 1705.88]  I will worship His holy name
[1705.88 --> 1707.88]  Sing like never before
[1707.88 --> 1709.88]  O my soul, O my soul
[1709.88 --> 1720.54]  I will worship His holy name
[1720.54 --> 1722.54]  I will worship His holy name
[1722.54 --> 1726.54]  Worship His holy name
[1726.54 --> 1728.54]  Worship His holy name
[1728.54 --> 1758.52]  Worship His holy name
[1758.54 --> 1759.90]  Open your Bibles
[1759.90 --> 1761.28]  Because it's good practice
[1761.28 --> 1763.98]  To open your Bibles
[1763.98 --> 1766.54]  To Psalm 78
[1766.54 --> 1772.70]  That is on page 437
[1772.70 --> 1775.24]  437 in your pew Bible
[1775.24 --> 1790.58]  So just a shorter reading
[1790.58 --> 1791.10]  For today
[1791.10 --> 1792.28]  But Psalm 78
[1792.28 --> 1794.50]  And I will read
[1794.50 --> 1795.58]  From verses 1
[1795.58 --> 1797.16]  To verse 8
[1797.16 --> 1800.12]  Okay, so let's follow along
[1800.12 --> 1801.76]  And I'll read from our pew Bible
[1801.76 --> 1804.22]  Oh, my people
[1804.22 --> 1806.12]  Hear my teaching
[1806.12 --> 1809.30]  Listen to the words of my mouth
[1809.30 --> 1812.16]  I will open my mouth in parables
[1812.16 --> 1814.12]  I will utter hidden things
[1814.68 --> 1815.90]  Things from of old
[1815.90 --> 1818.48]  What we have heard and known
[1818.48 --> 1820.80]  What our fathers have told us
[1820.80 --> 1823.44]  We will not hide from their children
[1823.44 --> 1826.10]  We will tell the next generation
[1826.10 --> 1828.28]  The praiseworthy deeds of the Lord
[1828.28 --> 1829.78]  His power
[1829.78 --> 1830.88]  And the wonders
[1830.88 --> 1832.14]  He has done
[1832.14 --> 1834.80]  He decreed statutes
[1834.80 --> 1835.64]  For Jacob
[1835.64 --> 1837.74]  And established the law
[1837.74 --> 1838.50]  In Israel
[1838.50 --> 1840.10]  Which He commanded
[1840.10 --> 1841.18]  Our forefathers
[1841.18 --> 1842.60]  To teach their children
[1842.60 --> 1844.56]  So the next generation
[1844.56 --> 1845.88]  Would know them
[1845.88 --> 1847.24]  Even the children
[1847.24 --> 1848.24]  Yet to be born
[1848.24 --> 1849.84]  And they in turn
[1849.84 --> 1851.08]  Would tell their children
[1851.08 --> 1853.32]  Then they would put their trust
[1853.32 --> 1854.00]  In God
[1854.00 --> 1855.74]  And would not forget
[1855.74 --> 1856.80]  His deeds
[1856.80 --> 1858.52]  But would keep His commands
[1858.52 --> 1860.00]  They would not be
[1860.00 --> 1861.04]  Like their forefathers
[1861.04 --> 1863.06]  A stubborn and rebellious generation
[1863.06 --> 1865.34]  Whose hearts were not loyal to God
[1865.34 --> 1867.42]  Whose spirits were not faithful
[1867.42 --> 1868.46]  To Him
[1868.46 --> 1870.54]  This is the word of the Lord
[1870.54 --> 1872.42]  Thanks be to God
[1872.42 --> 1876.26]  So in Matthew chapter 11
[1876.26 --> 1877.88]  Jesus invites
[1877.88 --> 1879.76]  All who labor
[1879.76 --> 1881.84]  And are heavy laden
[1881.84 --> 1883.64]  To come to Him
[1883.64 --> 1885.38]  For rest
[1885.38 --> 1886.88]  Right
[1886.88 --> 1888.00]  He tells us to take
[1888.00 --> 1889.52]  His yoke
[1889.52 --> 1891.16]  Upon us
[1891.16 --> 1892.32]  And to learn from Him
[1892.32 --> 1894.54]  Because He is gentle
[1894.54 --> 1897.06]  And He is lowly in heart
[1897.06 --> 1899.36]  So friends
[1899.36 --> 1900.94]  We now turn to the Lord
[1900.94 --> 1901.86]  In confession
[1901.86 --> 1904.28]  Where we do just that
[1904.28 --> 1905.02]  We take
[1905.02 --> 1907.40]  Upon ourselves
[1907.40 --> 1909.30]  Christ's easy yoke
[1909.30 --> 1910.92]  And we find rest
[1910.92 --> 1911.94]  For our souls
[1911.94 --> 1912.30]  You know
[1912.30 --> 1913.18]  Our souls are often
[1913.18 --> 1914.22]  So burdened
[1914.22 --> 1915.44]  By our sin
[1915.44 --> 1916.50]  By the sin
[1916.50 --> 1917.36]  Of this world
[1917.36 --> 1919.12]  But we can
[1919.12 --> 1920.66]  Unburden ourselves
[1920.66 --> 1922.20]  By casting our burdens
[1922.20 --> 1923.78]  At the foot of the cross
[1923.78 --> 1924.62]  And to receive
[1924.62 --> 1925.20]  His forgiveness
[1925.20 --> 1926.60]  So let's use
[1926.60 --> 1928.74]  The words of Psalm 51
[1928.74 --> 1930.84]  The first four verses
[1930.84 --> 1932.16]  To confess our sins
[1932.16 --> 1933.46]  Before Almighty God
[1933.46 --> 1935.30]  And then I will give you
[1935.30 --> 1936.70]  A time of silent confession
[1936.70 --> 1938.02]  Where I invite you
[1938.02 --> 1939.60]  To ask the Spirit of God
[1939.60 --> 1941.32]  To lead us to repentance
[1941.32 --> 1943.00]  So let's together
[1943.00 --> 1944.54]  Read first Psalm 51
[1944.54 --> 1948.50]  Have mercy on me
[1948.50 --> 1949.20]  Oh God
[1949.20 --> 1952.24]  According to your unfailing love
[1952.24 --> 1955.16]  According to your great compassion
[1955.16 --> 1957.96]  Blot out my transgressions
[1957.96 --> 1960.84]  Wash away all my iniquity
[1960.84 --> 1963.34]  And cleanse me from my sin
[1963.34 --> 1966.08]  For I know my transgressions
[1966.08 --> 1969.08]  And my sin is always before me
[1969.08 --> 1970.98]  Against you
[1970.98 --> 1973.64]  You only have I sinned
[1973.64 --> 1975.62]  And done what is evil
[1975.62 --> 1976.68]  In your sight
[1976.68 --> 1978.74]  So you are right
[1978.74 --> 1979.86]  In your verdict
[1979.86 --> 1981.14]  And justified
[1981.14 --> 1982.78]  When you judge
[1982.78 --> 1984.22]  So again
[1984.22 --> 1985.82]  To give you a moment
[1985.82 --> 1987.32]  Of silent confession
[1987.32 --> 1987.98]  Amen
[1987.98 --> 2017.96]  Thank you.
[2017.98 --> 2037.28]  O Lord, as we read your word, we are made aware that your standards of holiness, your standards of righteousness are so much higher than we often realize or acknowledge.
[2037.28 --> 2050.16]  And Lord, we confess before you the waywardness of our hearts, the selfishness that is within us, the violence even that we find when we look in the mirror.
[2050.16 --> 2053.02]  But Lord, you are merciful.
[2053.58 --> 2055.54]  And so we confess our sin before you.
[2056.24 --> 2066.24]  We acknowledge the ways that our sin is not the way you would have us to be as your people, but we freely, willfully, Lord, rebel against you.
[2067.62 --> 2076.54]  But Lord, we thank you that your mercy and your grace is far deeper than our sins, as deep and dark as they can be.
[2077.18 --> 2078.72]  Lord, your mercy is more.
[2078.90 --> 2082.24]  Your mercy is great because of your love for us in Christ Jesus.
[2082.44 --> 2085.38]  And so, Lord, we unburden our sins before you.
[2085.42 --> 2086.40]  We don't want to carry them.
[2087.18 --> 2095.38]  We lay them down at the foot of the cross where they were paid for by our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2095.38 --> 2103.60]  And so, Lord, would you renew us in your love for us this morning so that we might be confident that we are forgiven and that we would be at peace.
[2103.82 --> 2105.06]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2105.30 --> 2105.58]  Amen.
[2106.94 --> 2110.12]  So, God hears us when we acknowledge our sin to him.
[2110.66 --> 2119.66]  And he answers us back with words of assurance for those who look in faith to Christ for his pardon.
[2119.66 --> 2124.74]  So, I invite you to stand as we hear what God says to us from 1 John.
[2124.74 --> 2136.58]  This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you.
[2137.30 --> 2138.22]  God is light.
[2139.02 --> 2141.54]  In him, there is no darkness at all.
[2142.38 --> 2151.84]  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[2151.84 --> 2181.82]  Let us pray.
[2181.84 --> 2183.64]  Amen.
[2183.64 --> 2184.70]  Am I?
[2184.70 --> 2185.40]  Do you know who Ä?
[2185.98 --> 2187.22]  Do you know who�?
[2187.36 --> 2187.68]  Do you know whoウ?
[2187.72 --> 2189.68]  Do you know who

[2190.68 --> 2191.96]  Do you know who was snap?
[2191.96 --> 2192.84]  Do you know who is gone?
[2194.96 --> 2196.32]  Do you know who Lorne is Mona through her John?
[2196.32 --> 2200.66]  Do you know who 550 Jews are from the mind?
[2200.76 --> 2202.26]  Do you know who asks Zion?
[2202.30 --> 2203.90]  Do you know who תכ gibi derniersen or die注kinah?
[2203.94 --> 2205.70]  Do you know who works with Joy?
[2206.36 --> 2209.20]  Do you know who works for them?
[2209.20 --> 2209.88]  Denn as he lives.
[2209.88 --> 2211.26]  Do you know who works with Hurry?
[2211.26 --> 2211.66]  Would you know who works with joy?
[2211.66 --> 2214.26]  If you wish.
[2241.66 --> 2245.06]  Whose soul is poor that Дрн, the heart has
[2245.18 --> 2250.40]  Seni bamboid tienen como nos ponen
[2251.56 --> 2254.90]  Tornen en CONGREG Whitney
[2255.38 --> 2259.36]  O God give it love thing on me
[2261.26 --> 2262.54]  ?
[2262.54 --> 2272.54]  say
[2281.34 --> 2286.54]  is
[2292.54 --> 2299.54]  7
[2322.54 --> 2323.54]  Amen.
[2352.54 --> 2362.40]  You know, I think, you know, we've sung some of these songs that just have such rich lyrics,
[2362.40 --> 2367.32]  and it reminds me of something Martin Luther said, which was that, you know, he wouldn't
[2367.32 --> 2373.32]  mind other people maybe writing the confessions or the prayers, but he wanted to write the
[2373.32 --> 2379.38]  hymns because he knew that was the key to teaching people's hearts to praise God for
[2379.38 --> 2380.46]  who he is and what he's done.
[2380.46 --> 2382.82]  So, I think that was good.
[2383.18 --> 2387.92]  Anyway, the children are now dismissed to go to their classes.
[2387.92 --> 2413.92]  So, we are this morning continuing in our series in the book of Romans.
[2413.92 --> 2418.50]  So, would you go ahead and open your Bibles to Romans chapter 3?
[2420.10 --> 2424.42]  And this will be, today we'll look at Romans.
[2424.74 --> 2428.32]  Next week we have a guest preacher, Norman Van Eden Peterson.
[2428.90 --> 2430.68]  That'll be a fun time.
[2431.56 --> 2432.06]  Not really.
[2432.06 --> 2435.98]  And then we will be into Advent.
[2436.14 --> 2437.52]  And so, we're going to take a break from Romans.
[2437.66 --> 2441.24]  We're going to do an Advent series on John the Baptist.
[2442.30 --> 2444.42]  So, I am looking forward to that.
[2444.50 --> 2445.14]  I hope you are too.
[2445.82 --> 2450.82]  And then after Christmas, we will pick back up in the book of Romans.
[2450.82 --> 2457.02]  So, for now, we will look at Romans chapter 3, verses 1 through 8.
[2464.02 --> 2466.10]  Romans 3, verses 1 through 8.
[2466.62 --> 2468.52]  Let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2468.52 --> 2472.50]  What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew?
[2473.08 --> 2475.14]  Or what value is there in circumcision?
[2475.92 --> 2477.62]  Much in every way.
[2478.48 --> 2481.78]  First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.
[2483.16 --> 2486.44]  What if some did not have faith?
[2487.02 --> 2490.22]  Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?
[2490.70 --> 2491.54]  Not at all.
[2492.26 --> 2495.16]  Let God be true in every man a liar, as it is written,
[2495.16 --> 2498.46]  so that you may be proved right when you speak,
[2498.88 --> 2500.74]  and prevail when you judge.
[2502.12 --> 2505.82]  But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness,
[2506.38 --> 2508.10]  more clearly, what shall we say?
[2508.50 --> 2511.08]  That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us?
[2511.66 --> 2513.42]  I am using a human argument.
[2514.38 --> 2515.22]  Certainly not.
[2515.94 --> 2518.76]  If that were so, how could God judge the world?
[2519.58 --> 2523.26]  Someone might argue if my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness,
[2523.26 --> 2525.16]  and so increases his glory,
[2525.44 --> 2527.26]  why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
[2528.42 --> 2532.28]  Why not say, as we are being slanderously reported as saying,
[2532.36 --> 2533.78]  and as some claim that we say,
[2534.36 --> 2536.58]  let us do evil that good may result?
[2537.80 --> 2539.74]  Their condemnation is deserved.
[2540.64 --> 2541.90]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2541.90 --> 2552.86]  I think we should pray and commit these words to the Lord in prayer
[2552.86 --> 2554.38]  and ask for his blessing upon us,
[2554.58 --> 2556.50]  because these are very complicated words.
[2557.50 --> 2558.68]  I like how Peter says,
[2558.74 --> 2560.80]  some things Paul says are hard to understand.
[2561.80 --> 2563.62]  I think this would fall in that category,
[2563.84 --> 2565.38]  so let's ask for God's blessing.
[2565.38 --> 2569.42]  Our gracious Heavenly Father,
[2569.60 --> 2570.98]  we pray that your Holy Spirit
[2570.98 --> 2575.02]  would open your word now to our hearts,
[2575.68 --> 2578.36]  and open our hearts to your word,
[2579.02 --> 2580.20]  that we may believe
[2580.20 --> 2583.10]  and receive from you
[2583.10 --> 2586.04]  the things which belong to our peace and our joy.
[2586.72 --> 2589.06]  We pray through Christ our Lord.
[2589.40 --> 2589.74]  Amen.
[2589.74 --> 2597.70]  Now, I wonder if you have ever been involved in,
[2598.28 --> 2600.02]  at least at some point in your life,
[2600.14 --> 2602.60]  in a debate in theology.
[2605.16 --> 2610.22]  Okay, or let's say a family discussion around the dinner table,
[2610.32 --> 2613.92]  or just a discussion with somebody about the Bible,
[2614.50 --> 2616.34]  about the Christian faith.
[2617.18 --> 2617.36]  Right?
[2617.42 --> 2618.68]  We get in these discussions.
[2619.74 --> 2621.32]  When I was living in Taiwan,
[2621.52 --> 2622.82]  the church I was a part of,
[2622.92 --> 2625.38]  we had a monthly pub night.
[2626.18 --> 2627.48]  Yes, we didn't do it in the church,
[2627.80 --> 2629.28]  but we went to a restaurant
[2629.28 --> 2631.10]  where we got some beers, some snacks,
[2631.20 --> 2632.08]  we sat around tables,
[2632.08 --> 2635.54]  and we invited non-Christian friends and colleagues
[2635.54 --> 2637.16]  to come,
[2637.26 --> 2639.04]  and we'd have a topic for the night,
[2639.74 --> 2641.58]  and we would, you know,
[2641.64 --> 2643.44]  we would just talk about the Christian faith.
[2644.38 --> 2645.28]  And, you know,
[2645.34 --> 2646.24]  and so people would come,
[2646.30 --> 2647.56]  they would raise their questions,
[2647.56 --> 2650.28]  and we, as Christians,
[2650.40 --> 2651.80]  would, you know,
[2651.84 --> 2652.74]  do our best,
[2652.76 --> 2654.00]  as far as we were able,
[2654.20 --> 2655.54]  to provide some answers.
[2657.18 --> 2657.78]  You know,
[2657.84 --> 2660.10]  and whenever you have these kind of discussions,
[2660.48 --> 2662.20]  these debates about theology,
[2662.20 --> 2662.88]  or the Bible,
[2663.34 --> 2667.00]  there are questions which are helpful,
[2667.72 --> 2668.48]  good questions,
[2668.58 --> 2670.30]  people really seeking to understand.
[2670.30 --> 2673.54]  And then there are just those argumentative questions
[2673.54 --> 2675.92]  where they're not really questions of curiosity,
[2676.12 --> 2677.38]  they're questions of condemnation.
[2678.22 --> 2679.56]  Those are not as helpful.
[2680.76 --> 2681.40]  For example,
[2681.92 --> 2685.18]  the student who once asked St. Augustine
[2685.18 --> 2685.96]  in the fourth century,
[2686.68 --> 2689.08]  what was God doing before he created the world?
[2691.88 --> 2693.24]  Now, St. Augustine,
[2693.30 --> 2694.96]  he's heard this question before,
[2695.08 --> 2696.10]  maybe it was kind of popular,
[2696.10 --> 2699.80]  and he says he heard someone else answer this way.
[2700.38 --> 2701.94]  He was creating a hell
[2701.94 --> 2704.08]  for people who ask questions like that.
[2708.42 --> 2710.16]  Now, St. Augustine,
[2710.22 --> 2710.48]  actually,
[2710.54 --> 2711.74]  he didn't like that answer
[2711.74 --> 2714.94]  because he didn't feel
[2714.94 --> 2716.44]  that you should ridicule
[2716.44 --> 2718.56]  the person asking the question.
[2718.56 --> 2721.34]  And even though it was,
[2721.42 --> 2721.56]  you know,
[2721.58 --> 2722.42]  a pretty irrelevant
[2722.42 --> 2723.98]  and inane question,
[2724.40 --> 2725.78]  he thought the arguer
[2725.78 --> 2727.84]  should get a good response.
[2729.90 --> 2731.36]  Ask me after the service
[2731.36 --> 2732.24]  what his response was.
[2734.50 --> 2735.66]  I don't want to get too,
[2735.80 --> 2736.02]  anyway.
[2736.88 --> 2737.52]  But, okay,
[2737.60 --> 2738.76]  so my point is,
[2739.44 --> 2740.92]  this is what we see Paul doing
[2740.92 --> 2741.52]  in our text.
[2742.54 --> 2742.80]  Okay,
[2743.00 --> 2745.10]  he is answering some questions
[2745.10 --> 2747.26]  that he knows his hearers,
[2747.26 --> 2749.36]  those who are reading this letter
[2749.36 --> 2751.32]  that he wrote to the church in Rome,
[2751.52 --> 2753.46]  some questions that they will have,
[2753.98 --> 2757.16]  especially Jewish background believers.
[2758.02 --> 2760.20]  So Paul has been making the case
[2760.20 --> 2762.60]  ever since chapter 1, verse 18,
[2762.76 --> 2763.48]  all the way,
[2763.58 --> 2764.54]  and he's going to go until
[2764.54 --> 2766.04]  chapter 3, verse 20,
[2766.14 --> 2767.56]  this big chunk in Romans,
[2768.40 --> 2769.72]  he's been making the case
[2769.72 --> 2771.46]  that God is justly angry
[2771.46 --> 2775.40]  about our rebellion against himself.
[2775.40 --> 2778.22]  And that God is justly angry
[2778.22 --> 2780.08]  at our sinful behavior
[2780.08 --> 2781.30]  towards one another.
[2782.08 --> 2783.86]  That we see in the newspaper
[2783.86 --> 2784.62]  every day
[2784.62 --> 2785.68]  and that we see
[2785.68 --> 2787.50]  when we look in the mirror.
[2790.16 --> 2792.80]  And God is going to judge us
[2792.80 --> 2794.30]  as we deserve.
[2795.48 --> 2798.18]  And God raised Jesus from the dead
[2798.18 --> 2799.62]  and appointed him
[2799.62 --> 2800.84]  to be judge
[2800.84 --> 2803.00]  of every person who lives.
[2803.00 --> 2805.48]  And so then when Paul
[2805.48 --> 2807.38]  is talking about his gospel,
[2808.38 --> 2810.36]  he's not saying that,
[2810.56 --> 2810.84]  you know,
[2810.86 --> 2812.30]  it would be really nice
[2812.30 --> 2813.68]  if we met Jesus
[2813.68 --> 2815.50]  and invited him into our hearts.
[2816.50 --> 2819.64]  He is saying you will meet Jesus
[2819.64 --> 2822.30]  as judge on the final day.
[2822.86 --> 2824.60]  And you need to be saved
[2824.60 --> 2825.76]  from the wrath of God
[2825.76 --> 2827.46]  that you deserve for your sin
[2827.46 --> 2829.38]  by receiving the free gift
[2829.38 --> 2830.70]  of righteousness
[2830.70 --> 2832.00]  through Christ.
[2833.00 --> 2836.26]  But this message
[2836.26 --> 2838.32]  that he's been unpacking,
[2838.88 --> 2840.92]  it tends to raise the hackles
[2840.92 --> 2841.92]  of people who think
[2841.92 --> 2844.28]  that they are not really that bad.
[2844.28 --> 2846.24]  And that can't God
[2846.24 --> 2848.52]  just get on board with me.
[2849.40 --> 2850.70]  And people who try
[2850.70 --> 2852.14]  to distinguish themselves
[2852.14 --> 2853.56]  from other people
[2853.56 --> 2855.66]  by their nationality
[2855.66 --> 2856.80]  or their upbringing
[2856.80 --> 2857.72]  or their language
[2857.72 --> 2859.76]  or any other thing
[2859.76 --> 2861.50]  where we try to say
[2861.50 --> 2862.50]  we're maybe not as bad
[2862.50 --> 2863.10]  as other people.
[2864.80 --> 2866.48]  Because Paul is leveling
[2866.48 --> 2867.28]  the playing field
[2867.28 --> 2868.66]  and saying every single person
[2868.66 --> 2869.42]  will be judged
[2869.42 --> 2871.92]  that God shows no favoritism.
[2872.32 --> 2872.86]  And that
[2872.86 --> 2875.22]  is what gets Paul
[2875.22 --> 2876.48]  into such hot water.
[2877.14 --> 2879.02]  Especially with his fellow Jews.
[2880.02 --> 2881.40]  And so in our passage today,
[2881.40 --> 2882.68]  Paul responds
[2882.68 --> 2883.90]  to some of these arguments
[2883.90 --> 2884.74]  that he knows
[2884.74 --> 2885.34]  that they have
[2885.34 --> 2886.58]  because he's been doing this.
[2886.82 --> 2887.50]  He's been going around
[2887.50 --> 2888.16]  the Roman Empire.
[2888.32 --> 2889.76]  He's been preaching the gospel
[2889.76 --> 2891.30]  to Jews in the synagogue.
[2891.80 --> 2892.26]  He knows,
[2892.40 --> 2893.58]  he himself is a Jew.
[2893.82 --> 2895.02]  He knows what they're thinking.
[2895.62 --> 2897.74]  And so he's taking this pause
[2897.74 --> 2900.76]  to respond to some pushback
[2900.76 --> 2902.44]  that he knows he's going to get.
[2903.44 --> 2904.56]  Now there are basically
[2904.56 --> 2905.60]  four arguments
[2905.60 --> 2907.16]  in these eight verses.
[2907.36 --> 2908.20]  It's very compact.
[2908.62 --> 2909.18]  He doesn't want to spend
[2909.18 --> 2910.18]  a lot of time on this.
[2910.66 --> 2911.34]  And some stuff
[2911.34 --> 2912.34]  he's going to get to later.
[2913.22 --> 2914.62]  But what I want to do today
[2914.62 --> 2916.24]  is look at some of these arguments.
[2916.76 --> 2917.60]  Okay, so it's kind of like
[2917.60 --> 2918.92]  two verses per argument.
[2920.42 --> 2921.20]  And we're going to look
[2921.20 --> 2922.72]  at the responses that Paul gives.
[2923.04 --> 2923.82]  And then I will,
[2923.94 --> 2924.70]  you know, we'll conclude
[2924.70 --> 2925.58]  with some,
[2926.20 --> 2927.40]  considering some application.
[2928.60 --> 2929.60]  Okay, so let's look
[2929.60 --> 2931.26]  at these arguments.
[2932.12 --> 2933.50]  You know, we'll have
[2933.50 --> 2934.34]  the verses on the screen.
[2934.46 --> 2935.46]  You can also keep the Bible
[2935.46 --> 2936.44]  open in front of you.
[2937.74 --> 2938.90]  The first argument
[2938.90 --> 2939.88]  goes like this.
[2940.44 --> 2941.20]  Okay, Paul is speaking
[2941.20 --> 2942.26]  to his fellow Jews.
[2943.78 --> 2944.90]  They are okay
[2944.90 --> 2946.12]  with the idea
[2946.12 --> 2948.22]  of the wrath of God.
[2949.38 --> 2950.18]  They're okay
[2950.18 --> 2951.14]  with the idea
[2951.14 --> 2952.08]  of God's judgment
[2952.08 --> 2954.10]  as long as it doesn't
[2954.10 --> 2955.20]  involve them.
[2956.48 --> 2957.58]  And the arguer says,
[2957.72 --> 2958.24]  look, Paul,
[2958.68 --> 2959.82]  of course we believe
[2959.82 --> 2960.92]  in the holiness of God.
[2961.28 --> 2962.50]  Of course we believe
[2962.50 --> 2963.68]  in the righteous judgment
[2963.68 --> 2964.24]  of God
[2964.24 --> 2966.10]  for the Gentiles.
[2966.10 --> 2968.34]  we're Jews.
[2968.90 --> 2970.20]  We're God's covenant people.
[2970.60 --> 2971.42]  We have the law.
[2971.70 --> 2972.60]  We have the priests.
[2972.84 --> 2973.76]  We have circumcision.
[2974.12 --> 2974.74]  We tithe.
[2975.38 --> 2976.40]  We attend synagogue
[2976.40 --> 2977.76]  or church regularly.
[2979.24 --> 2980.20]  And you're trying
[2980.20 --> 2981.02]  to tell us
[2981.02 --> 2982.60]  that we don't have
[2982.60 --> 2983.94]  favoritism with God
[2983.94 --> 2984.70]  on the day of judgment?
[2984.70 --> 2986.38]  Well then,
[2987.16 --> 2988.12]  what use
[2988.12 --> 2989.22]  is there
[2989.22 --> 2990.16]  in being a Jew?
[2991.36 --> 2992.40]  What is the point?
[2992.40 --> 2994.00]  Is it all a waste
[2994.00 --> 2994.56]  of time?
[2994.64 --> 2995.54]  All that God did
[2995.54 --> 2996.26]  through the Old Testament.
[2997.78 --> 2998.94]  And Paul's answer
[2998.94 --> 3000.44]  is a bit of a surprise.
[3001.18 --> 3001.92]  So let's look
[3001.92 --> 3002.50]  at the question
[3002.50 --> 3003.04]  and the answer
[3003.04 --> 3003.90]  in verses 1 and 2.
[3005.90 --> 3007.02]  What advantage,
[3007.18 --> 3008.14]  the arguer,
[3008.50 --> 3009.28]  would say then,
[3009.62 --> 3010.24]  is there
[3010.24 --> 3010.90]  in being a Jew?
[3010.98 --> 3012.30]  Or what is the value
[3012.30 --> 3013.26]  in circumcision?
[3014.08 --> 3014.98]  What's the response?
[3015.98 --> 3018.04]  Much in every way.
[3018.04 --> 3020.30]  First of all,
[3020.70 --> 3021.08]  the Jews
[3021.08 --> 3021.90]  had been entrusted
[3021.90 --> 3023.58]  with the very words
[3023.58 --> 3024.84]  of God.
[3028.80 --> 3030.12]  Paul is saying,
[3031.42 --> 3032.36]  God gave
[3032.36 --> 3033.76]  the Jews
[3033.76 --> 3034.76]  actually
[3034.76 --> 3036.34]  tremendous privileges.
[3038.18 --> 3039.66]  Above all,
[3040.32 --> 3041.48]  he entrusted them
[3041.48 --> 3043.02]  with his words.
[3043.66 --> 3044.86]  And that can
[3044.86 --> 3045.88]  never be undone.
[3046.96 --> 3047.54]  That is something
[3047.54 --> 3048.24]  that God did
[3048.24 --> 3049.08]  for the Jewish people.
[3049.24 --> 3050.48]  That was a great blessing.
[3051.66 --> 3051.92]  Right?
[3051.98 --> 3052.68]  He did not give
[3052.68 --> 3053.12]  his word
[3053.12 --> 3053.84]  to the Egyptians.
[3054.22 --> 3054.96]  He didn't give it
[3054.96 --> 3055.74]  to the Hittites
[3055.74 --> 3056.96]  or the Philistines.
[3057.64 --> 3058.70]  God entrusted
[3058.70 --> 3059.42]  his word
[3059.42 --> 3061.00]  to the Jews.
[3061.96 --> 3062.64]  The Jews
[3062.64 --> 3063.40]  were the ones
[3063.40 --> 3063.92]  upon whom
[3063.92 --> 3065.14]  God set his love
[3065.14 --> 3066.18]  and his favor
[3066.18 --> 3068.66]  and among whom
[3068.66 --> 3069.24]  he did
[3069.24 --> 3070.18]  his amazing works
[3070.18 --> 3070.68]  of redemption.
[3071.14 --> 3071.72]  He led them
[3071.72 --> 3072.32]  out of slavery
[3072.32 --> 3073.10]  in Egypt.
[3073.66 --> 3074.42]  He appeared
[3074.42 --> 3074.72]  to them
[3074.72 --> 3075.46]  on Mount Sinai
[3075.46 --> 3075.94]  and gave them
[3075.94 --> 3076.40]  the law.
[3076.40 --> 3077.38]  He brought them
[3077.38 --> 3078.56]  into the promised land.
[3078.70 --> 3079.30]  He established
[3079.30 --> 3079.90]  his kingdom
[3079.90 --> 3080.76]  of Judah
[3080.76 --> 3081.44]  through whom
[3081.44 --> 3082.08]  the Messiah
[3082.08 --> 3082.58]  would come.
[3083.96 --> 3085.44]  These are amazing
[3085.44 --> 3086.02]  privileges
[3086.02 --> 3088.32]  and dignity
[3088.32 --> 3089.14]  and delight
[3089.14 --> 3089.94]  in being a Jew.
[3091.68 --> 3092.38]  You know,
[3092.46 --> 3093.14]  and as we think
[3093.14 --> 3094.02]  about that,
[3094.82 --> 3095.40]  likewise,
[3095.92 --> 3096.66]  there are
[3096.66 --> 3098.16]  advantages
[3098.16 --> 3099.38]  and privileges
[3099.38 --> 3101.18]  that our children
[3101.18 --> 3101.62]  have
[3101.62 --> 3103.64]  or our grandchildren
[3103.64 --> 3104.24]  have
[3104.24 --> 3105.70]  that our covenant
[3105.70 --> 3106.52]  children have
[3106.52 --> 3107.96]  over other children
[3107.96 --> 3109.10]  who do not grow up
[3109.10 --> 3109.90]  in a Christian home.
[3110.90 --> 3111.34]  Right?
[3111.40 --> 3112.08]  And so think of the
[3112.08 --> 3112.56]  advantage
[3112.56 --> 3114.12]  of children
[3114.12 --> 3115.14]  growing up
[3115.14 --> 3116.40]  as part of the church.
[3117.10 --> 3118.22]  Having a church
[3118.22 --> 3118.66]  family
[3118.66 --> 3120.28]  where we worship
[3120.28 --> 3121.60]  God every Lord's Day.
[3123.00 --> 3123.52]  Right?
[3123.58 --> 3124.46]  Think of the advantage
[3124.46 --> 3125.46]  they have
[3125.46 --> 3126.56]  of knowing God
[3126.56 --> 3127.60]  from a young age.
[3128.60 --> 3128.98]  Right?
[3128.98 --> 3129.66]  of Christ
[3129.66 --> 3130.56]  being proclaimed
[3130.56 --> 3131.34]  to them
[3131.34 --> 3132.82]  every day,
[3133.04 --> 3133.84]  every week.
[3135.56 --> 3136.80]  Think of the advantage
[3136.80 --> 3137.88]  of having parents
[3137.88 --> 3139.00]  who are concerned
[3139.00 --> 3140.42]  for their souls.
[3141.54 --> 3142.14]  Right?
[3142.24 --> 3143.40]  So what advantage
[3143.40 --> 3144.96]  do our children have?
[3145.82 --> 3147.32]  Much in every way.
[3147.32 --> 3149.86]  But what Paul
[3149.86 --> 3150.62]  has been arguing
[3150.62 --> 3151.52]  is that all of that
[3151.52 --> 3151.96]  privilege,
[3152.10 --> 3152.94]  all of that advantage
[3152.94 --> 3154.24]  does not give you
[3154.24 --> 3155.60]  a special pass
[3155.60 --> 3156.88]  on the day of judgment.
[3157.80 --> 3158.80]  Because what counts
[3158.80 --> 3159.44]  before God
[3159.44 --> 3160.88]  is not being one
[3160.88 --> 3161.90]  who is outwardly
[3161.90 --> 3162.84]  circumcised
[3162.84 --> 3164.34]  as we saw last week,
[3164.40 --> 3165.14]  but someone
[3165.14 --> 3166.70]  who is inwardly
[3166.70 --> 3167.32]  circumcised
[3167.32 --> 3167.98]  in the heart
[3167.98 --> 3169.10]  by the Holy Spirit.
[3170.90 --> 3171.04]  Okay?
[3171.06 --> 3171.64]  So that's the
[3171.64 --> 3173.72]  first question
[3173.72 --> 3174.18]  and answer.
[3174.34 --> 3174.82]  What's the point
[3174.82 --> 3175.64]  of them being a Jew?
[3176.06 --> 3176.90]  It's advantage
[3176.90 --> 3177.84]  in much in every way.
[3178.06 --> 3178.72]  You have the word
[3178.72 --> 3179.20]  of the Lord.
[3179.62 --> 3180.32]  What a blessing
[3180.32 --> 3181.46]  to have God's word.
[3182.62 --> 3183.78]  And how sad it is
[3183.78 --> 3185.06]  not to have God's word.
[3186.14 --> 3187.04]  But that leads us
[3187.04 --> 3187.88]  to the second argument,
[3188.40 --> 3189.44]  which we find
[3189.44 --> 3190.04]  in verse 3.
[3192.14 --> 3193.00]  So look here.
[3193.10 --> 3193.22]  Yeah.
[3193.22 --> 3194.74]  what if some
[3194.74 --> 3196.12]  were unfaithful?
[3196.12 --> 3197.72]  Will their unfaithfulness
[3197.72 --> 3198.64]  nullify
[3198.64 --> 3201.20]  God's faithfulness?
[3202.46 --> 3204.18]  So the Jewish people
[3204.18 --> 3205.04]  were the ones
[3205.04 --> 3206.94]  of which God said
[3206.94 --> 3208.32]  of all of the families
[3208.32 --> 3209.32]  of the earth,
[3209.70 --> 3210.86]  only you
[3210.86 --> 3212.00]  have I loved.
[3213.00 --> 3214.32]  And the Jews,
[3214.50 --> 3215.12]  as God's
[3215.12 --> 3216.12]  loved,
[3216.30 --> 3216.64]  beloved,
[3217.00 --> 3217.72]  special people,
[3218.10 --> 3219.16]  were the ones
[3219.16 --> 3219.86]  who should have then
[3219.86 --> 3220.48]  responded
[3220.48 --> 3222.26]  to God's faithfulness
[3222.26 --> 3223.90]  with their own
[3223.90 --> 3225.02]  faithfulness.
[3225.42 --> 3226.32]  But as you know,
[3226.38 --> 3227.00]  as we read
[3227.00 --> 3227.84]  throughout the Old Testament
[3227.84 --> 3228.80]  again and again,
[3230.64 --> 3231.78]  many Jews
[3231.78 --> 3232.62]  were unfaithful.
[3233.62 --> 3234.72]  And they were sent
[3234.72 --> 3235.82]  into exile
[3235.82 --> 3237.48]  because they didn't
[3237.48 --> 3238.46]  keep covenant
[3238.46 --> 3239.06]  with God.
[3239.22 --> 3239.86]  They worshipped
[3239.86 --> 3240.78]  other gods.
[3242.94 --> 3243.84]  And so with
[3243.84 --> 3244.76]  the second argument,
[3245.02 --> 3245.90]  Paul imagines
[3245.90 --> 3246.48]  the Jewish
[3246.48 --> 3247.58]  arguer saying,
[3247.58 --> 3248.82]  now look,
[3248.94 --> 3249.14]  Paul,
[3249.22 --> 3249.94]  if what you're
[3249.94 --> 3250.88]  saying is true,
[3250.92 --> 3251.58]  that being a Jew
[3251.58 --> 3252.94]  doesn't exclude you
[3252.94 --> 3254.00]  from God's judgment
[3254.00 --> 3255.06]  on the final day,
[3255.90 --> 3256.50]  well then God
[3256.50 --> 3257.46]  has not been faithful
[3257.46 --> 3258.94]  to his covenant
[3258.94 --> 3259.68]  promises.
[3261.28 --> 3261.80]  Right?
[3261.90 --> 3262.50]  God promised
[3262.50 --> 3263.58]  a blessed destiny
[3263.58 --> 3264.90]  for the Jewish people.
[3265.06 --> 3266.20]  And you are saying
[3266.20 --> 3266.64]  now
[3266.64 --> 3269.14]  that you're all
[3269.14 --> 3269.66]  in the,
[3269.72 --> 3270.18]  that we're all
[3270.18 --> 3270.96]  in the same boat,
[3271.16 --> 3271.96]  the same boat
[3271.96 --> 3273.24]  of sin and condemnation
[3273.24 --> 3274.98]  as everyone else
[3274.98 --> 3275.60]  in the world?
[3275.60 --> 3277.58]  God must not
[3277.58 --> 3278.44]  be faithful then.
[3280.64 --> 3281.74]  How does Paul
[3281.74 --> 3282.40]  respond?
[3283.38 --> 3283.92]  Let's look at
[3283.92 --> 3284.38]  verse 4.
[3286.18 --> 3286.52]  He says,
[3286.80 --> 3287.24]  not at all.
[3287.46 --> 3288.26]  Is God unfaithful?
[3288.40 --> 3289.50]  Not at all.
[3290.18 --> 3291.32]  Let God be true
[3291.32 --> 3292.42]  and every human
[3292.42 --> 3293.46]  being a liar
[3293.46 --> 3294.90]  as it is written
[3294.90 --> 3296.08]  so that you may
[3296.08 --> 3296.90]  be proved right
[3296.90 --> 3297.68]  when you speak
[3297.68 --> 3298.66]  and prevail
[3298.66 --> 3300.24]  when you judge.
[3301.88 --> 3303.58]  The truth is,
[3303.70 --> 3304.42]  Paul says,
[3304.42 --> 3305.98]  and your criticism
[3305.98 --> 3306.86]  of God
[3306.86 --> 3308.42]  just goes to show
[3308.42 --> 3310.18]  that the problem
[3310.18 --> 3312.14]  is with you
[3312.14 --> 3314.00]  and not with God.
[3314.74 --> 3316.48]  You have been unfaithful
[3316.48 --> 3317.52]  to the word
[3317.52 --> 3318.40]  of God
[3318.40 --> 3319.46]  that he has
[3319.46 --> 3320.14]  given you.
[3321.00 --> 3322.40]  Now does that mean
[3322.40 --> 3323.20]  that God
[3323.20 --> 3324.14]  is not faithful?
[3325.08 --> 3326.02]  Well that's a crazy
[3326.02 --> 3326.50]  argument.
[3327.76 --> 3327.94]  Right?
[3328.02 --> 3328.74]  Because their
[3328.74 --> 3330.58]  faithlessness
[3330.58 --> 3331.58]  has to be measured
[3331.58 --> 3332.44]  by a standard
[3332.44 --> 3333.78]  of faithfulness.
[3334.68 --> 3335.28]  So their
[3335.28 --> 3336.14]  faithlessness
[3336.14 --> 3337.18]  can only be
[3337.18 --> 3339.20]  seen as faithless
[3339.20 --> 3339.82]  if there is
[3339.82 --> 3340.46]  such a thing
[3340.46 --> 3341.86]  as faithfulness
[3341.86 --> 3342.42]  which is
[3342.42 --> 3343.10]  God.
[3344.80 --> 3345.78]  And so for the Jews
[3345.78 --> 3346.28]  to be found
[3346.28 --> 3347.02]  unfaithful
[3347.02 --> 3347.54]  means that they're
[3347.54 --> 3348.32]  not living up
[3348.32 --> 3349.06]  to the standard
[3349.06 --> 3351.00]  of God's faithfulness.
[3351.94 --> 3352.08]  Right?
[3352.28 --> 3353.26]  Or so if you imagine
[3353.26 --> 3354.42]  like in a wedding,
[3354.72 --> 3355.30]  a marriage,
[3355.34 --> 3356.08]  if one spouse
[3356.08 --> 3356.98]  is unfaithful,
[3357.12 --> 3357.84]  that does not
[3357.84 --> 3358.66]  necessarily mean
[3358.66 --> 3359.62]  that the other one
[3359.62 --> 3361.46]  was also unfaithful.
[3362.42 --> 3362.94]  Especially
[3362.94 --> 3363.84]  when it comes
[3363.84 --> 3364.28]  to God.
[3365.40 --> 3366.80]  And so he appeals
[3366.80 --> 3367.62]  then to
[3367.62 --> 3369.08]  Psalm 51
[3369.08 --> 3369.88]  which we looked
[3369.88 --> 3370.48]  at earlier.
[3370.96 --> 3371.40]  Okay, that's the
[3371.40 --> 3372.28]  Old Testament quote
[3372.28 --> 3373.38]  that we see here.
[3373.66 --> 3374.62]  So now what is
[3374.62 --> 3375.76]  Psalm 51 all about?
[3376.24 --> 3377.60]  So if we look
[3377.60 --> 3378.04]  here
[3378.04 --> 3380.42]  at the top
[3380.42 --> 3381.42]  of the psalm,
[3381.82 --> 3382.38]  it gives us
[3382.38 --> 3383.06]  an occasion
[3383.06 --> 3383.94]  for the writing
[3383.94 --> 3384.52]  of the psalm.
[3384.72 --> 3385.32]  And this is part
[3385.32 --> 3385.74]  of the Bible.
[3385.74 --> 3387.74]  So it says
[3387.74 --> 3388.84]  for the director
[3388.84 --> 3389.32]  of music,
[3389.48 --> 3390.24]  a psalm of David,
[3390.64 --> 3391.28]  when the prophet
[3391.28 --> 3392.56]  Nathan came to him
[3392.56 --> 3393.66]  after David
[3393.66 --> 3394.16]  had committed
[3394.16 --> 3394.84]  adultery
[3394.84 --> 3395.96]  with
[3395.96 --> 3397.74]  Bathsheba.
[3398.44 --> 3399.50]  I copied
[3399.50 --> 3400.20]  and pasted that wrong.
[3400.78 --> 3401.38]  With Bathsheba.
[3401.80 --> 3402.78]  So you remember,
[3402.94 --> 3403.10]  right,
[3403.14 --> 3403.62]  King David,
[3403.72 --> 3404.22]  he looked out
[3404.22 --> 3404.62]  the window,
[3405.06 --> 3406.04]  he saw a woman
[3406.04 --> 3406.84]  that he desired
[3406.84 --> 3407.36]  sexually,
[3407.62 --> 3408.56]  he took her,
[3409.30 --> 3409.80]  and then he
[3409.80 --> 3410.40]  colluded
[3410.40 --> 3411.22]  and arranged
[3411.22 --> 3412.22]  to have her husband
[3412.22 --> 3413.86]  put to death
[3413.86 --> 3414.96]  to hide
[3414.96 --> 3415.90]  his sin.
[3417.02 --> 3417.58]  And Nathan,
[3417.72 --> 3418.22]  the prophet,
[3418.76 --> 3419.64]  comes and
[3419.64 --> 3420.66]  confronts David
[3420.66 --> 3421.10]  and says,
[3421.22 --> 3422.02]  you are the man.
[3423.06 --> 3424.00]  And Psalm 51
[3424.00 --> 3425.26]  is a confession
[3425.26 --> 3426.04]  that David
[3426.04 --> 3426.78]  makes.
[3428.26 --> 3429.10]  And here
[3429.10 --> 3429.90]  is the point.
[3430.32 --> 3431.30]  With King David,
[3431.30 --> 3432.40]  you cannot have
[3432.40 --> 3433.30]  a truer
[3433.30 --> 3434.02]  Jew.
[3435.08 --> 3435.68]  Right?
[3435.78 --> 3436.52]  He is
[3436.52 --> 3438.02]  the bluest
[3438.02 --> 3438.46]  Jew,
[3438.70 --> 3439.44]  the true blue
[3439.44 --> 3440.82]  prince of
[3440.82 --> 3441.72]  Israel,
[3442.24 --> 3443.04]  man after
[3443.04 --> 3443.62]  God's own
[3443.62 --> 3444.06]  heart.
[3444.78 --> 3445.44]  But look
[3445.44 --> 3446.34]  at verse
[3446.34 --> 3446.72]  four.
[3447.56 --> 3448.04]  This is what
[3448.04 --> 3448.70]  David prays.
[3448.76 --> 3449.42]  Against you,
[3449.54 --> 3450.24]  you only
[3450.24 --> 3451.28]  have I sinned
[3451.28 --> 3451.58]  and done
[3451.58 --> 3452.14]  what is evil
[3452.14 --> 3452.80]  in your sight.
[3452.96 --> 3453.74]  So you are
[3453.74 --> 3454.78]  right in your
[3454.78 --> 3455.52]  verdict and
[3455.52 --> 3456.06]  justified
[3456.06 --> 3457.50]  when you
[3457.50 --> 3457.94]  judge.
[3459.92 --> 3460.18]  See,
[3460.30 --> 3461.26]  David recognizes
[3461.26 --> 3461.98]  that he
[3461.98 --> 3463.54]  was unfaithful.
[3464.90 --> 3465.76]  He admits
[3465.76 --> 3465.96]  it.
[3466.66 --> 3467.50]  He admits
[3467.50 --> 3467.98]  that he
[3467.98 --> 3468.90]  deserves
[3468.90 --> 3470.26]  punishment.
[3470.26 --> 3472.78]  for God
[3472.78 --> 3473.10]  to say
[3473.10 --> 3473.44]  that you
[3473.44 --> 3473.82]  were being
[3473.82 --> 3474.66]  unfaithful,
[3474.94 --> 3475.40]  that God
[3475.40 --> 3475.92]  judges
[3475.92 --> 3477.16]  justly
[3477.16 --> 3477.74]  and rightly.
[3479.30 --> 3479.68]  So when,
[3480.76 --> 3481.52]  so what does
[3481.52 --> 3482.22]  David do
[3482.22 --> 3482.94]  when he confesses
[3482.94 --> 3483.58]  his sin to God?
[3483.66 --> 3484.14]  He essentially
[3484.14 --> 3484.62]  says,
[3485.08 --> 3485.66]  you God
[3485.66 --> 3486.32]  are in the
[3486.32 --> 3486.70]  right,
[3487.44 --> 3488.50]  I am
[3488.50 --> 3488.72]  in the
[3488.72 --> 3488.96]  wrong.
[3490.30 --> 3491.02]  There's no
[3491.02 --> 3491.72]  excuses,
[3492.24 --> 3492.84]  there's no
[3492.84 --> 3493.62]  blame shifting,
[3494.04 --> 3494.74]  he is owning
[3494.74 --> 3495.44]  up to the
[3495.44 --> 3496.18]  reality of
[3496.18 --> 3496.66]  his sin.
[3496.66 --> 3498.20]  And when
[3498.20 --> 3499.06]  we own
[3499.06 --> 3499.42]  up to the
[3499.42 --> 3500.02]  reality of
[3500.02 --> 3500.42]  our sin,
[3500.50 --> 3500.92]  we say
[3500.92 --> 3501.26]  the same
[3501.26 --> 3501.56]  thing,
[3501.76 --> 3502.44]  you God
[3502.44 --> 3503.86]  are right,
[3504.42 --> 3505.32]  I am
[3505.32 --> 3505.62]  wrong.
[3507.08 --> 3507.54]  And friends,
[3507.68 --> 3508.50]  this is where
[3508.50 --> 3509.94]  true repentance
[3509.94 --> 3510.66]  begins.
[3511.98 --> 3512.56]  Right?
[3512.60 --> 3513.24]  It's recognizing
[3513.24 --> 3514.20]  that I am
[3514.20 --> 3514.58]  in the
[3514.58 --> 3515.46]  wrong and
[3515.46 --> 3516.02]  God is
[3516.02 --> 3516.68]  righteous in
[3516.68 --> 3517.26]  his judgment
[3517.26 --> 3518.24]  even if I
[3518.24 --> 3518.82]  am punished
[3518.82 --> 3519.24]  on that
[3519.24 --> 3519.72]  last day.
[3521.04 --> 3521.90]  And if we
[3521.90 --> 3522.50]  do not come
[3522.50 --> 3523.14]  to that place
[3523.14 --> 3523.70]  of repentance
[3523.70 --> 3525.32]  in our own
[3525.32 --> 3526.24]  hearts where
[3526.24 --> 3526.92]  we acknowledge
[3526.92 --> 3527.82]  God's just
[3527.82 --> 3528.66]  judgment against
[3528.66 --> 3529.26]  our sin,
[3529.40 --> 3529.78]  then the
[3529.78 --> 3530.44]  gospel will
[3530.44 --> 3531.12]  remain outside
[3531.12 --> 3531.68]  of us.
[3532.30 --> 3532.82]  And it has
[3532.82 --> 3533.34]  no power
[3533.34 --> 3533.82]  to save
[3533.82 --> 3534.12]  us.
[3534.82 --> 3535.22]  And that is
[3535.22 --> 3535.94]  why Paul is
[3535.94 --> 3536.40]  going through
[3536.40 --> 3537.24]  such lengths
[3537.24 --> 3538.10]  in this whole
[3538.10 --> 3538.70]  first part of
[3538.70 --> 3539.70]  the book so
[3539.70 --> 3540.12]  that we would
[3540.12 --> 3541.06]  realize the
[3541.06 --> 3541.76]  just judgment
[3541.76 --> 3542.16]  of God
[3542.16 --> 3542.64]  against our
[3542.64 --> 3542.82]  sin.
[3545.70 --> 3546.18]  So,
[3546.40 --> 3547.32]  now there's
[3547.32 --> 3547.66]  a third
[3547.66 --> 3548.82]  argument that
[3548.82 --> 3549.42]  Paul deals
[3549.42 --> 3549.74]  with in
[3549.74 --> 3550.34]  verse 5.
[3552.06 --> 3552.70]  But if
[3552.70 --> 3553.14]  our
[3553.14 --> 3554.26]  unrighteousness
[3554.26 --> 3555.40]  brings out
[3555.40 --> 3555.84]  God's
[3555.84 --> 3556.40]  righteousness
[3556.40 --> 3557.54]  more clearly,
[3557.80 --> 3558.06]  what shall
[3558.06 --> 3558.42]  we say?
[3558.48 --> 3558.90]  That God
[3558.90 --> 3559.78]  is unjust
[3559.78 --> 3560.26]  in bringing
[3560.26 --> 3560.90]  his wrath
[3560.90 --> 3561.98]  on us?
[3563.34 --> 3563.90]  And Paul
[3563.90 --> 3564.44]  says,
[3564.76 --> 3565.36]  I am using
[3565.36 --> 3566.08]  a human
[3566.08 --> 3566.80]  argument,
[3567.68 --> 3568.16]  essentially
[3568.16 --> 3568.80]  meaning that
[3568.80 --> 3569.54]  he is a
[3569.54 --> 3569.82]  little bit
[3569.82 --> 3570.34]  embarrassed
[3570.34 --> 3571.40]  that he
[3571.40 --> 3571.92]  even has
[3571.92 --> 3572.34]  to deal
[3572.34 --> 3572.86]  with this
[3572.86 --> 3573.64]  or that
[3573.64 --> 3574.26]  someone would
[3574.26 --> 3574.88]  even say
[3574.88 --> 3575.34]  such a
[3575.34 --> 3575.54]  thing.
[3577.44 --> 3577.94]  So,
[3578.06 --> 3578.38]  here,
[3578.80 --> 3579.58]  the argument,
[3579.76 --> 3580.52]  the arguer
[3580.52 --> 3581.32]  is saying,
[3581.96 --> 3582.30]  okay,
[3582.30 --> 3583.64]  I am
[3583.64 --> 3583.90]  wrong,
[3583.98 --> 3584.26]  God is
[3584.26 --> 3584.60]  right,
[3585.44 --> 3585.96]  but,
[3586.24 --> 3587.16]  how about
[3587.16 --> 3587.64]  this,
[3588.60 --> 3589.60]  if the
[3589.60 --> 3590.20]  blackness
[3590.20 --> 3590.60]  of my
[3590.60 --> 3591.24]  sin better
[3591.24 --> 3592.08]  displays the
[3592.08 --> 3592.66]  beauty and
[3592.66 --> 3593.62]  brilliance of
[3593.62 --> 3593.94]  God's
[3593.94 --> 3594.22]  goodness,
[3594.42 --> 3594.82]  why should
[3594.82 --> 3595.38]  God punish
[3595.38 --> 3595.74]  me?
[3596.46 --> 3596.58]  Right?
[3596.66 --> 3597.18]  Aren't I
[3597.18 --> 3598.00]  doing something
[3598.00 --> 3598.68]  for him?
[3600.26 --> 3601.06]  In other
[3601.06 --> 3601.30]  words,
[3601.40 --> 3601.96]  why should
[3601.96 --> 3602.62]  God inflict
[3602.62 --> 3603.20]  wrath upon
[3603.20 --> 3603.80]  me if I'm
[3603.80 --> 3604.66]  only highlighting
[3604.66 --> 3605.56]  his
[3605.56 --> 3606.40]  righteousness
[3606.40 --> 3607.48]  with my
[3607.48 --> 3608.64]  unrighteousness?
[3608.64 --> 3610.12]  How does
[3610.12 --> 3610.88]  Paul respond?
[3612.02 --> 3612.48]  Let's look at
[3612.48 --> 3612.96]  verse 6.
[3613.46 --> 3613.90]  Certainly
[3613.90 --> 3614.42]  not.
[3616.14 --> 3616.82]  These are
[3616.82 --> 3617.46]  the strongest
[3617.46 --> 3618.38]  words in
[3618.38 --> 3618.80]  Greek that
[3618.80 --> 3619.08]  he could
[3619.08 --> 3619.82]  possibly use
[3619.82 --> 3620.52]  to refute
[3620.52 --> 3621.54]  a position.
[3622.42 --> 3623.58]  No way.
[3624.10 --> 3624.88]  Not on
[3624.88 --> 3625.80]  your life.
[3627.06 --> 3627.72]  If that
[3627.72 --> 3628.54]  were so,
[3628.84 --> 3629.44]  how could
[3629.44 --> 3630.36]  God judge
[3630.36 --> 3631.18]  the world?
[3632.76 --> 3633.00]  Right?
[3633.14 --> 3633.90]  Paul says,
[3634.00 --> 3634.22]  I've been
[3634.22 --> 3634.94]  spending paragraph
[3634.94 --> 3636.00]  after paragraph
[3636.00 --> 3636.80]  insisting that
[3636.80 --> 3637.28]  God is going
[3637.28 --> 3637.84]  to judge the
[3637.84 --> 3638.22]  world,
[3638.64 --> 3639.82]  by taking
[3639.82 --> 3640.54]  into account
[3640.54 --> 3641.52]  everybody's
[3641.52 --> 3641.98]  works,
[3642.72 --> 3643.38]  everybody's
[3643.38 --> 3643.78]  actions,
[3643.96 --> 3644.64]  everybody's
[3644.64 --> 3645.34]  behavior.
[3646.54 --> 3647.06]  And God
[3647.06 --> 3647.64]  will judge
[3647.64 --> 3648.22]  us by
[3648.22 --> 3648.84]  what we
[3648.84 --> 3649.52]  have actually
[3649.52 --> 3650.08]  done.
[3650.84 --> 3651.28]  Right?
[3651.38 --> 3651.88]  What our
[3651.88 --> 3652.56]  thoughts or
[3652.56 --> 3653.06]  words or
[3653.06 --> 3654.42]  deeds have
[3654.42 --> 3654.72]  been,
[3654.86 --> 3655.60]  have they been
[3655.60 --> 3656.14]  in obedience
[3656.14 --> 3656.66]  to God's
[3656.66 --> 3656.92]  word?
[3657.68 --> 3658.84]  Has our
[3658.84 --> 3659.42]  behavior,
[3659.78 --> 3660.18]  our thoughts,
[3660.28 --> 3660.86]  our words,
[3661.20 --> 3661.78]  have they
[3661.78 --> 3662.96]  glorified God?
[3663.10 --> 3663.52]  Have they
[3663.52 --> 3664.08]  loved God
[3664.08 --> 3664.40]  and loved
[3664.40 --> 3664.84]  others?
[3665.80 --> 3666.34]  God is
[3666.34 --> 3666.72]  going to
[3666.72 --> 3667.30]  judge the
[3667.30 --> 3667.88]  world according
[3667.88 --> 3668.32]  to what
[3668.32 --> 3669.26]  our actions
[3669.26 --> 3670.28]  deserve.
[3671.30 --> 3672.22]  That's how
[3672.22 --> 3672.64]  it's going
[3672.64 --> 3673.10]  to be.
[3674.66 --> 3675.24]  And so
[3675.24 --> 3675.56]  let's just
[3675.56 --> 3676.16]  ask a very
[3676.16 --> 3677.06]  basic question.
[3678.18 --> 3678.90]  Does God
[3678.90 --> 3680.24]  need our
[3680.24 --> 3682.68]  sin for
[3682.68 --> 3683.20]  him to
[3683.20 --> 3683.78]  prove his
[3683.78 --> 3684.14]  righteousness?
[3686.06 --> 3686.66]  No.
[3688.14 --> 3689.06]  Is God
[3689.06 --> 3689.74]  in any
[3689.74 --> 3690.14]  way
[3690.14 --> 3691.04]  dependent
[3691.04 --> 3693.26]  on us
[3693.26 --> 3694.08]  to be
[3694.08 --> 3694.66]  who he
[3694.66 --> 3695.12]  is?
[3695.84 --> 3696.58]  To be
[3696.58 --> 3696.98]  God?
[3698.02 --> 3698.50]  Does God
[3698.50 --> 3699.26]  need us
[3699.26 --> 3700.50]  to reveal
[3700.50 --> 3701.56]  anything about
[3701.56 --> 3702.02]  who he
[3702.02 --> 3702.42]  is?
[3702.48 --> 3702.70]  And the
[3702.70 --> 3703.42]  answer is
[3703.42 --> 3704.30]  an unequivocal
[3704.30 --> 3704.70]  no.
[3705.50 --> 3706.56]  God is
[3706.56 --> 3707.46]  complete
[3707.46 --> 3708.76]  and perfect
[3708.76 --> 3709.86]  in himself.
[3709.98 --> 3710.22]  You don't
[3710.22 --> 3710.60]  come into
[3710.60 --> 3711.14]  this world
[3711.14 --> 3711.94]  and help
[3711.94 --> 3712.46]  God in
[3712.46 --> 3713.00]  any way.
[3714.42 --> 3714.92]  He is
[3714.92 --> 3715.74]  infinitely
[3715.74 --> 3716.24]  glorious,
[3716.62 --> 3717.00]  infinitely
[3717.00 --> 3717.62]  pure,
[3717.62 --> 3718.14]  righteous,
[3718.14 --> 3718.82]  and just,
[3718.98 --> 3719.42]  and holy.
[3720.30 --> 3721.18]  No matter
[3721.18 --> 3721.76]  what you
[3721.76 --> 3722.18]  do,
[3722.30 --> 3722.68]  you cannot
[3722.68 --> 3723.56]  add or
[3723.56 --> 3724.32]  take away
[3724.32 --> 3725.44]  from God's
[3725.44 --> 3726.02]  righteousness
[3726.02 --> 3726.68]  or who he
[3726.68 --> 3727.04]  is.
[3727.56 --> 3727.94]  And to
[3727.94 --> 3728.42]  say that
[3728.42 --> 3728.68]  your
[3728.68 --> 3729.88]  unrighteousness
[3729.88 --> 3731.98]  brings out
[3731.98 --> 3733.46]  God's
[3733.46 --> 3734.06]  righteousness
[3734.06 --> 3735.84]  is folly
[3735.84 --> 3737.04]  and sin
[3737.04 --> 3737.40]  to the
[3737.40 --> 3737.62]  greatest
[3737.62 --> 3738.00]  order.
[3740.10 --> 3740.44]  And then
[3740.44 --> 3740.96]  Paul's really
[3740.96 --> 3741.42]  getting kind
[3741.42 --> 3741.66]  of worked
[3741.66 --> 3742.02]  up here
[3742.02 --> 3742.52]  because the
[3742.52 --> 3743.12]  fourth argument
[3743.12 --> 3743.48]  we see
[3743.48 --> 3743.76]  in verse
[3743.76 --> 3744.10]  seven,
[3744.90 --> 3745.20]  someone
[3745.20 --> 3746.34]  might argue
[3746.34 --> 3748.02]  if my
[3748.02 --> 3748.92]  falsehood
[3748.92 --> 3749.52]  enhances
[3749.52 --> 3750.08]  God's
[3750.08 --> 3750.62]  truthfulness
[3750.62 --> 3751.28]  and so
[3751.28 --> 3751.82]  increases
[3751.82 --> 3752.40]  his glory,
[3752.66 --> 3753.24]  why am I
[3753.24 --> 3753.64]  still being
[3753.64 --> 3753.92]  condemned
[3753.92 --> 3754.30]  as a
[3754.30 --> 3754.50]  sinner?
[3755.54 --> 3756.04]  And again,
[3756.14 --> 3756.42]  it's the
[3756.42 --> 3756.86]  same sort
[3756.86 --> 3757.32]  of idea.
[3757.94 --> 3758.16]  The
[3758.16 --> 3758.86]  arguer is
[3758.86 --> 3759.10]  saying,
[3759.28 --> 3759.60]  I'm only
[3759.60 --> 3760.18]  highlighting
[3760.18 --> 3760.94]  something good
[3760.94 --> 3761.66]  about God.
[3761.92 --> 3762.18]  Why?
[3762.56 --> 3762.98]  God should
[3762.98 --> 3763.66]  therefore take
[3763.66 --> 3764.08]  it easy
[3764.08 --> 3764.60]  on me.
[3766.54 --> 3767.18]  And Paul
[3767.18 --> 3767.84]  responds in
[3767.84 --> 3768.48]  verse eight,
[3769.42 --> 3769.84]  why not
[3769.84 --> 3770.28]  say,
[3770.42 --> 3770.76]  as some
[3770.76 --> 3771.32]  slanderously
[3771.32 --> 3771.78]  claim that
[3771.78 --> 3772.18]  we say,
[3772.46 --> 3772.78]  let us
[3772.78 --> 3773.16]  just do
[3773.16 --> 3773.82]  good that
[3773.82 --> 3775.10]  evil that
[3775.10 --> 3775.58]  good may
[3775.58 --> 3776.24]  result.
[3777.40 --> 3777.70]  Their
[3777.70 --> 3778.38]  condemnation
[3778.38 --> 3779.02]  is just.
[3781.46 --> 3781.96]  So think
[3781.96 --> 3782.40]  about this
[3782.40 --> 3782.98]  argument that
[3782.98 --> 3783.48]  they're making.
[3784.24 --> 3784.72]  I should
[3784.72 --> 3785.30]  do more
[3785.30 --> 3787.78]  sin so
[3787.78 --> 3788.26]  that more
[3788.26 --> 3788.68]  of God's
[3788.68 --> 3789.10]  goodness can
[3789.10 --> 3789.52]  be shown.
[3789.52 --> 3795.38]  think about
[3795.38 --> 3797.54]  the lengths
[3797.54 --> 3799.66]  that God
[3799.66 --> 3800.24]  had to
[3800.24 --> 3800.88]  go through
[3800.88 --> 3801.60]  to deal
[3801.60 --> 3802.04]  with our
[3802.04 --> 3802.32]  sin.
[3804.54 --> 3805.10]  Right?
[3805.14 --> 3805.48]  It was not
[3805.48 --> 3805.86]  just a
[3805.86 --> 3806.32]  flip of a
[3806.32 --> 3807.74]  hand in
[3807.74 --> 3808.10]  saying,
[3808.28 --> 3808.64]  oh well,
[3808.72 --> 3809.24]  I'll just
[3809.24 --> 3810.26]  forgive sin.
[3810.72 --> 3810.92]  No,
[3810.98 --> 3811.50]  God had
[3811.50 --> 3812.20]  to give
[3812.20 --> 3812.68]  up the
[3812.68 --> 3812.88]  most
[3812.88 --> 3813.30]  precious
[3813.30 --> 3814.40]  thing
[3814.40 --> 3815.66]  to him
[3815.66 --> 3816.16]  in the
[3816.16 --> 3816.52]  world,
[3816.94 --> 3817.52]  his only
[3817.52 --> 3817.86]  son.
[3818.80 --> 3819.26]  Which
[3819.26 --> 3820.08]  means that
[3820.08 --> 3821.42]  our
[3821.42 --> 3821.88]  forgiveness
[3821.88 --> 3822.68]  was costly.
[3825.02 --> 3825.28]  And then
[3825.28 --> 3825.88]  for us,
[3825.94 --> 3826.40]  for our
[3826.40 --> 3827.08]  attitude to
[3827.08 --> 3827.26]  say,
[3827.36 --> 3827.68]  oh let's
[3827.68 --> 3828.28]  just go
[3828.28 --> 3828.80]  sin,
[3829.80 --> 3831.02]  no.
[3831.62 --> 3831.92]  Right?
[3832.14 --> 3832.50]  Our
[3832.50 --> 3832.94]  attitude
[3832.94 --> 3833.44]  and our
[3833.44 --> 3834.20]  response
[3834.20 --> 3835.52]  should be
[3835.52 --> 3836.32]  a hatred
[3836.32 --> 3837.12]  of our
[3837.12 --> 3838.22]  sin and
[3838.22 --> 3838.84]  of anything
[3838.84 --> 3839.28]  that is
[3839.28 --> 3839.52]  against
[3839.52 --> 3839.80]  God's
[3839.80 --> 3840.08]  holiness.
[3841.44 --> 3842.22]  And notice
[3842.22 --> 3842.58]  what Paul
[3842.58 --> 3842.96]  says,
[3843.10 --> 3843.82]  if you
[3843.82 --> 3844.40]  say such
[3844.40 --> 3844.80]  a thing,
[3845.08 --> 3845.36]  let us
[3845.36 --> 3845.96]  just sin,
[3845.96 --> 3846.98]  your
[3846.98 --> 3847.70]  condemnation
[3847.70 --> 3848.42]  is just.
[3850.64 --> 3851.20]  That's the
[3851.20 --> 3851.60]  response.
[3853.16 --> 3853.80]  So now
[3853.80 --> 3854.08]  in the
[3854.08 --> 3854.42]  time we
[3854.42 --> 3854.60]  have
[3854.60 --> 3855.00]  remaining,
[3855.14 --> 3855.28]  let's
[3855.28 --> 3855.74]  consider
[3855.74 --> 3856.64]  what can
[3856.64 --> 3857.02]  we take
[3857.02 --> 3857.40]  away from
[3857.40 --> 3857.70]  this,
[3857.82 --> 3858.20]  these
[3858.20 --> 3858.78]  arguments,
[3859.20 --> 3859.66]  this question
[3859.66 --> 3860.12]  and answer
[3860.12 --> 3860.38]  that we
[3860.38 --> 3860.80]  have here.
[3861.18 --> 3861.56]  How can
[3861.56 --> 3861.88]  we apply
[3861.88 --> 3862.18]  this to
[3862.18 --> 3862.46]  our own
[3862.46 --> 3862.80]  lives?
[3863.62 --> 3863.94]  I've got
[3863.94 --> 3864.38]  two things
[3864.38 --> 3864.64]  I want
[3864.64 --> 3864.96]  to say.
[3865.60 --> 3866.12]  The first
[3866.12 --> 3866.64]  is I
[3866.64 --> 3867.58]  think that
[3867.58 --> 3868.34]  this shows
[3868.34 --> 3868.82]  us that
[3868.82 --> 3869.04]  in
[3869.04 --> 3869.50]  Christianity
[3869.50 --> 3870.14]  there is
[3870.14 --> 3870.58]  room
[3870.58 --> 3871.68]  for honest
[3871.68 --> 3872.26]  questions.
[3873.26 --> 3873.66]  There is
[3873.66 --> 3873.98]  room for
[3873.98 --> 3874.52]  questions.
[3874.52 --> 3875.52]  And so
[3875.52 --> 3876.12]  perhaps you
[3876.12 --> 3876.46]  have been
[3876.46 --> 3876.78]  part of
[3876.78 --> 3877.30]  a church
[3877.30 --> 3877.88]  or you
[3877.88 --> 3878.00]  have been
[3878.00 --> 3878.30]  part of
[3878.30 --> 3878.86]  a family
[3878.86 --> 3880.08]  where
[3880.08 --> 3882.00]  people get
[3882.00 --> 3882.86]  very worried
[3882.86 --> 3883.88]  if you
[3883.88 --> 3884.24]  ask
[3884.24 --> 3885.04]  questions.
[3885.94 --> 3886.54]  Maybe they
[3886.54 --> 3887.00]  think,
[3887.00 --> 3887.54]  well,
[3888.02 --> 3888.22]  if you're
[3888.22 --> 3888.68]  asking this
[3888.68 --> 3889.02]  question,
[3889.12 --> 3889.64]  maybe you're
[3889.64 --> 3890.34]  kind of
[3890.34 --> 3891.02]  wandering
[3891.02 --> 3891.76]  away from
[3891.76 --> 3892.22]  the faith
[3892.22 --> 3892.64]  or maybe
[3892.64 --> 3892.88]  you're
[3892.88 --> 3893.54]  wandering
[3893.54 --> 3894.02]  away from
[3894.02 --> 3894.42]  Christ.
[3895.68 --> 3896.50]  But Paul
[3896.50 --> 3897.02]  here,
[3897.14 --> 3897.36]  he's
[3897.36 --> 3898.06]  answering
[3898.06 --> 3899.18]  these
[3899.18 --> 3899.54]  difficult
[3899.54 --> 3900.16]  questions
[3900.16 --> 3900.76]  that
[3900.76 --> 3900.98]  his
[3900.98 --> 3901.34]  audience
[3901.34 --> 3901.74]  had.
[3903.88 --> 3904.32]  Now,
[3904.86 --> 3905.08]  these
[3905.08 --> 3905.32]  might
[3905.32 --> 3905.56]  not
[3905.56 --> 3905.74]  be
[3905.74 --> 3905.92]  the
[3905.92 --> 3906.08]  same
[3906.08 --> 3906.50]  questions
[3906.50 --> 3906.68]  that
[3906.68 --> 3906.86]  we
[3906.86 --> 3907.26]  have,
[3908.26 --> 3908.98]  but
[3908.98 --> 3909.14]  they
[3909.14 --> 3909.66]  mattered
[3909.66 --> 3910.54]  to
[3910.54 --> 3910.74]  the
[3910.74 --> 3910.98]  church
[3910.98 --> 3911.14]  in
[3911.14 --> 3911.36]  Rome.
[3911.72 --> 3911.94]  They
[3911.94 --> 3912.36]  mattered
[3912.36 --> 3912.88]  deeply
[3912.88 --> 3913.64]  to
[3913.64 --> 3914.16]  his
[3914.16 --> 3914.66]  fellow
[3914.66 --> 3915.38]  Jewish
[3915.38 --> 3915.86]  believers.
[3916.96 --> 3917.18]  And so
[3917.18 --> 3917.46]  Paul
[3917.46 --> 3917.80]  doesn't
[3917.80 --> 3918.14]  shy
[3918.14 --> 3918.52]  away
[3918.52 --> 3918.78]  from
[3918.78 --> 3918.96]  their
[3918.96 --> 3919.42]  questions.
[3919.68 --> 3919.72]  He
[3919.72 --> 3920.08]  doesn't
[3920.08 --> 3920.40]  say,
[3920.54 --> 3920.68]  well,
[3920.74 --> 3920.96]  you're
[3920.96 --> 3921.26]  just,
[3921.36 --> 3921.62]  you know,
[3921.82 --> 3922.36]  maybe
[3922.36 --> 3922.56]  you're
[3922.56 --> 3922.76]  just
[3922.76 --> 3923.42]  losing
[3923.42 --> 3923.72]  the
[3923.72 --> 3924.18]  faith.
[3925.66 --> 3926.10]  You
[3926.10 --> 3926.24]  know,
[3926.30 --> 3926.50]  even
[3926.50 --> 3926.74]  though
[3926.74 --> 3927.00]  some
[3927.00 --> 3927.20]  of
[3927.20 --> 3927.34]  these
[3927.34 --> 3927.70]  questions,
[3927.80 --> 3927.92]  some
[3927.92 --> 3928.12]  of them
[3928.12 --> 3928.30]  sound
[3928.30 --> 3928.50]  a little
[3928.50 --> 3928.88]  heretical.
[3930.16 --> 3930.54]  But as
[3930.54 --> 3930.86]  a good
[3930.86 --> 3931.36]  pastor,
[3931.76 --> 3932.26]  Paul
[3932.26 --> 3932.70]  knows
[3932.70 --> 3933.28]  that he
[3933.28 --> 3933.58]  wants
[3933.58 --> 3933.86]  to put
[3933.86 --> 3934.30]  himself
[3934.30 --> 3934.70]  in the
[3934.70 --> 3935.28]  shoes
[3935.28 --> 3935.66]  of his
[3935.66 --> 3936.02]  listener,
[3936.46 --> 3937.14]  and he's
[3937.14 --> 3937.66]  anticipating
[3937.66 --> 3938.24]  their problems,
[3938.24 --> 3938.70]  and he's
[3938.70 --> 3939.86]  willing to
[3939.86 --> 3940.26]  give them
[3940.26 --> 3940.52]  a good
[3940.52 --> 3940.88]  answer.
[3942.52 --> 3942.92]  And,
[3942.98 --> 3943.22]  you know,
[3943.34 --> 3943.76]  it can
[3943.76 --> 3944.44]  actually be
[3944.44 --> 3944.94]  a good
[3944.94 --> 3945.60]  sign
[3945.60 --> 3946.84]  that we
[3946.84 --> 3947.14]  do
[3947.14 --> 3947.70]  have
[3947.70 --> 3948.24]  faith
[3948.24 --> 3949.32]  when we
[3949.32 --> 3949.50]  are
[3949.50 --> 3949.82]  willing
[3949.82 --> 3950.10]  to
[3950.10 --> 3950.34]  wrestle
[3950.34 --> 3950.56]  with
[3950.56 --> 3950.68]  the
[3950.68 --> 3950.92]  claims
[3950.92 --> 3951.06]  of
[3951.06 --> 3951.16]  the
[3951.16 --> 3951.40]  Bible.
[3952.76 --> 3952.98]  Right?
[3953.02 --> 3953.18]  If
[3953.18 --> 3953.46]  we're
[3953.46 --> 3954.26]  kind
[3954.26 --> 3954.38]  of
[3954.38 --> 3954.66]  hearing
[3954.66 --> 3954.90]  what
[3954.90 --> 3955.08]  God
[3955.08 --> 3955.38]  says,
[3955.42 --> 3955.52]  and
[3955.52 --> 3955.80]  we're
[3955.80 --> 3956.52]  debating
[3956.52 --> 3956.84]  with
[3956.84 --> 3957.08]  God,
[3957.12 --> 3957.34]  and we're
[3957.34 --> 3957.88]  questioning
[3957.88 --> 3958.16]  it,
[3958.18 --> 3958.40]  and we're
[3958.40 --> 3958.72]  wrestling
[3958.72 --> 3959.36]  with it,
[3959.92 --> 3960.76]  that is
[3960.76 --> 3961.08]  much
[3961.08 --> 3961.54]  better
[3961.54 --> 3962.46]  than a
[3962.46 --> 3962.78]  person
[3962.78 --> 3963.08]  who
[3963.08 --> 3963.80]  hears
[3963.80 --> 3964.22]  God's
[3964.22 --> 3964.54]  word
[3964.54 --> 3965.00]  and
[3965.00 --> 3965.36]  can't
[3965.36 --> 3965.58]  be
[3965.58 --> 3966.10]  bothered
[3966.10 --> 3966.66]  to
[3966.66 --> 3966.92]  think
[3966.92 --> 3967.24]  about
[3967.24 --> 3967.54]  it,
[3967.54 --> 3968.18]  or to
[3968.18 --> 3968.86]  engage
[3968.86 --> 3969.66]  with
[3969.66 --> 3970.02]  God's
[3970.02 --> 3970.16]  word
[3970.16 --> 3970.50]  at all.
[3972.40 --> 3973.12]  You know,
[3973.20 --> 3973.76]  in Christianity,
[3973.76 --> 3974.38]  it's not
[3974.38 --> 3975.10]  always easy
[3975.10 --> 3975.78]  to believe.
[3976.96 --> 3977.54]  It is not
[3977.54 --> 3978.16]  always very
[3978.16 --> 3978.56]  obvious.
[3979.28 --> 3979.76]  For some
[3979.76 --> 3980.10]  people,
[3980.28 --> 3980.66]  maybe it
[3980.66 --> 3981.00]  is,
[3981.82 --> 3983.24]  but in
[3983.24 --> 3983.56]  a lot of
[3983.56 --> 3983.80]  cases,
[3983.80 --> 3984.34]  it's not.
[3984.56 --> 3984.70]  You know,
[3984.78 --> 3985.56]  and so real
[3985.56 --> 3987.58]  faith tends
[3987.58 --> 3987.84]  to be
[3987.84 --> 3988.44]  accompanied
[3988.44 --> 3989.68]  by honest
[3989.68 --> 3990.18]  questioning.
[3991.90 --> 3992.56]  And so I
[3992.56 --> 3992.94]  think there
[3992.94 --> 3993.32]  needs to
[3993.32 --> 3993.72]  be room,
[3993.78 --> 3994.24]  there is
[3994.24 --> 3994.82]  room in
[3994.82 --> 3995.32]  Christianity
[3995.32 --> 3996.58]  to bring
[3996.58 --> 3997.40]  our honest
[3997.40 --> 3998.10]  questions
[3998.10 --> 3999.08]  before God.
[4000.98 --> 4001.74]  That being
[4001.74 --> 4002.20]  said,
[4002.30 --> 4002.62]  on the
[4002.62 --> 4003.54]  other hand,
[4004.40 --> 4004.84]  the second
[4004.84 --> 4005.32]  thing we can
[4005.32 --> 4005.74]  take away
[4005.74 --> 4006.16]  from this
[4006.16 --> 4006.50]  is that
[4006.50 --> 4006.98]  there is
[4006.98 --> 4007.30]  such a
[4007.30 --> 4007.68]  thing as
[4007.68 --> 4008.14]  sinful
[4008.14 --> 4008.88]  arguing.
[4010.18 --> 4010.78]  And so,
[4010.88 --> 4011.00]  you know,
[4011.04 --> 4011.42]  we look at
[4011.42 --> 4011.80]  that first
[4011.80 --> 4012.40]  question,
[4012.56 --> 4012.78]  and the
[4012.78 --> 4013.26]  arguers
[4013.26 --> 4013.60]  here,
[4013.70 --> 4013.88]  you know,
[4013.90 --> 4014.32]  they ask
[4014.32 --> 4014.58]  a fair
[4014.58 --> 4014.88]  question.
[4014.96 --> 4015.06]  Well,
[4015.12 --> 4015.62]  what use
[4015.62 --> 4016.04]  is it,
[4016.36 --> 4016.66]  you know,
[4016.74 --> 4017.50]  of circumcision?
[4017.50 --> 4017.84]  If Paul
[4017.84 --> 4018.34]  just said,
[4018.52 --> 4018.80]  it's of,
[4018.92 --> 4019.14]  you know,
[4019.24 --> 4019.84]  basically it
[4019.84 --> 4020.34]  doesn't matter,
[4020.42 --> 4020.80]  your outward
[4020.80 --> 4021.38]  circumcision.
[4021.62 --> 4022.22]  It's a
[4022.22 --> 4023.38]  worthy question
[4023.38 --> 4023.98]  to respond
[4023.98 --> 4024.32]  to.
[4024.96 --> 4025.76]  But then you
[4025.76 --> 4026.42]  notice that
[4026.42 --> 4026.78]  with each
[4026.78 --> 4027.40]  question,
[4027.50 --> 4028.02]  it just
[4028.02 --> 4028.66]  gets worse
[4028.66 --> 4029.78]  and worse.
[4030.68 --> 4032.08]  The fourth
[4032.08 --> 4032.82]  question is
[4032.82 --> 4033.22]  just plain
[4033.22 --> 4033.94]  blasphemous.
[4034.50 --> 4034.82]  And Paul
[4034.82 --> 4035.32]  doesn't even
[4035.32 --> 4035.98]  dignify it
[4035.98 --> 4036.24]  with an
[4036.24 --> 4036.56]  answer.
[4037.10 --> 4037.74]  Because at
[4037.74 --> 4038.16]  that point,
[4038.22 --> 4038.60]  you're dealing
[4038.60 --> 4039.20]  with someone
[4039.20 --> 4040.60]  who is not
[4040.60 --> 4041.40]  asking honest
[4041.40 --> 4041.92]  questions,
[4042.12 --> 4042.66]  they're just
[4042.66 --> 4043.12]  arguing.
[4043.42 --> 4043.72]  They're not
[4043.72 --> 4044.12]  trying to get
[4044.12 --> 4044.66]  to the truth,
[4044.66 --> 4045.12]  they're just
[4045.12 --> 4046.34]  digging themselves
[4046.34 --> 4047.18]  deeper and it
[4047.18 --> 4047.82]  gets more and
[4047.82 --> 4048.78]  more ridiculous
[4048.78 --> 4049.48]  and irrelevant.
[4050.72 --> 4051.46]  And there is a
[4051.46 --> 4052.02]  time when the
[4052.02 --> 4052.98]  proper response,
[4053.50 --> 4054.04]  as Proverbs
[4054.04 --> 4054.54]  says,
[4054.80 --> 4055.32]  is to not
[4055.32 --> 4056.04]  answer a fool
[4056.04 --> 4056.60]  according to
[4056.60 --> 4057.14]  his folly,
[4057.48 --> 4058.42]  or you yourself
[4058.42 --> 4058.94]  will be just
[4058.94 --> 4059.32]  like him.
[4061.10 --> 4061.80]  So Paul
[4061.80 --> 4062.32]  doesn't feel
[4062.32 --> 4062.84]  the need
[4062.84 --> 4064.10]  with these
[4064.10 --> 4065.10]  increasingly sinful
[4065.10 --> 4065.76]  questions to
[4065.76 --> 4066.36]  give an answer.
[4068.14 --> 4069.08]  And in the same
[4069.08 --> 4069.28]  way,
[4069.34 --> 4070.18]  God does not
[4070.18 --> 4071.10]  have to satisfy
[4071.10 --> 4072.10]  our questions
[4072.10 --> 4072.54]  and our
[4072.54 --> 4072.94]  arguments
[4072.94 --> 4074.16]  when we
[4074.16 --> 4074.74]  go into
[4074.74 --> 4075.32]  realms
[4075.32 --> 4076.82]  that were
[4076.82 --> 4077.32]  not intended
[4077.32 --> 4077.94]  for us.
[4079.26 --> 4079.70]  Right?
[4079.76 --> 4080.66]  In many respects,
[4080.78 --> 4081.18]  the question
[4081.18 --> 4081.50]  is,
[4081.62 --> 4082.60]  who are we
[4082.60 --> 4083.34]  to question
[4083.34 --> 4083.68]  God?
[4084.58 --> 4085.30]  And that's
[4085.30 --> 4086.38]  precisely what
[4086.38 --> 4087.38]  we find in
[4087.38 --> 4087.80]  the book of
[4087.80 --> 4088.54]  Job, right?
[4088.70 --> 4088.92]  You know,
[4089.02 --> 4090.14]  Job was a
[4090.14 --> 4090.86]  righteous person.
[4091.32 --> 4091.82]  And if you
[4091.82 --> 4092.30]  remember,
[4093.20 --> 4093.92]  Job suffered,
[4094.14 --> 4094.70]  he has all
[4094.70 --> 4094.94]  of these
[4094.94 --> 4095.48]  questions,
[4096.08 --> 4096.82]  he's questioning
[4096.82 --> 4097.34]  God,
[4098.04 --> 4099.20]  and finally,
[4099.34 --> 4100.06]  at the end,
[4100.10 --> 4100.62]  he's done with
[4100.62 --> 4100.88]  all of his
[4100.88 --> 4101.28]  questions,
[4101.50 --> 4101.82]  he's kind
[4101.82 --> 4102.28]  of exhausted
[4102.28 --> 4103.08]  himself out.
[4104.86 --> 4105.88]  God listens,
[4106.30 --> 4106.96]  but now God
[4106.96 --> 4107.38]  is going to
[4107.38 --> 4107.90]  answer Job.
[4109.00 --> 4109.60]  God has
[4109.60 --> 4110.00]  listened to
[4110.00 --> 4110.52]  all of Job's
[4110.52 --> 4110.88]  questions,
[4110.98 --> 4111.54]  and now it's
[4111.54 --> 4112.38]  his turn
[4112.38 --> 4113.20]  to question
[4113.20 --> 4113.66]  Job.
[4114.06 --> 4114.58]  So God
[4114.58 --> 4115.44]  questions him
[4115.44 --> 4115.92]  for like
[4115.92 --> 4116.76]  four chapters.
[4117.84 --> 4118.16]  There's
[4118.16 --> 4118.62]  hundreds of
[4118.62 --> 4119.10]  questions,
[4119.32 --> 4119.84]  one after
[4119.84 --> 4120.20]  another,
[4120.48 --> 4121.14]  from chapter
[4121.14 --> 4121.94]  38 all the
[4121.94 --> 4122.16]  way to
[4122.16 --> 4122.54]  41.
[4123.14 --> 4123.74]  Here's just
[4123.74 --> 4124.40]  a small
[4124.40 --> 4125.64]  section that
[4125.64 --> 4126.24]  actually kind
[4126.24 --> 4126.84]  of relates
[4126.84 --> 4127.38]  to our
[4127.38 --> 4127.88]  passage of
[4127.88 --> 4128.36]  Romans 3,
[4129.36 --> 4130.20]  where,
[4130.20 --> 4130.56]  you know,
[4130.64 --> 4131.62]  arguing against
[4131.62 --> 4132.32]  God's just
[4132.32 --> 4132.66]  judgment.
[4133.22 --> 4133.76]  So let's
[4133.76 --> 4134.28]  look at it.
[4134.82 --> 4135.46]  This is what
[4135.46 --> 4136.62]  God says to
[4136.62 --> 4136.96]  Job.
[4137.34 --> 4137.68]  Brace
[4137.68 --> 4138.28]  yourself like
[4138.28 --> 4138.68]  a man.
[4139.18 --> 4139.66]  I will
[4139.66 --> 4140.68]  question you,
[4140.86 --> 4141.38]  and you
[4141.38 --> 4141.94]  shall answer
[4141.94 --> 4142.30]  me.
[4143.16 --> 4143.74]  Would you
[4143.74 --> 4144.40]  discredit
[4144.40 --> 4145.04]  my justice?
[4145.84 --> 4146.28]  Would you
[4146.28 --> 4147.20]  condemn me
[4147.20 --> 4148.42]  to justify
[4148.42 --> 4149.24]  yourself?
[4150.24 --> 4150.88]  Do you
[4150.88 --> 4151.32]  have an
[4151.32 --> 4151.96]  arm like
[4151.96 --> 4152.60]  God's,
[4152.86 --> 4153.28]  and can
[4153.28 --> 4153.90]  your voice
[4153.90 --> 4154.46]  thunder like
[4154.46 --> 4154.80]  his?
[4155.22 --> 4155.86]  Then adorn
[4155.86 --> 4156.44]  yourself with
[4156.44 --> 4157.00]  glory and
[4157.00 --> 4157.48]  splendor,
[4157.82 --> 4158.46]  clothe yourself
[4158.46 --> 4158.94]  with honor
[4158.94 --> 4159.56]  and majesty?
[4160.14 --> 4160.80]  Then I
[4160.80 --> 4161.40]  myself will
[4161.40 --> 4161.82]  admit to
[4161.82 --> 4163.08]  you that
[4163.08 --> 4163.64]  your own
[4163.64 --> 4164.06]  right hand
[4164.06 --> 4164.46]  can save
[4164.46 --> 4164.66]  you.
[4168.26 --> 4168.82]  Obviously,
[4168.96 --> 4169.54]  we can't
[4169.54 --> 4170.18]  do any
[4170.18 --> 4170.56]  of that.
[4172.04 --> 4172.22]  And so
[4172.22 --> 4172.62]  the question
[4172.62 --> 4173.20]  isn't,
[4173.70 --> 4175.34]  who are
[4175.34 --> 4175.72]  you,
[4175.88 --> 4176.20]  God,
[4176.26 --> 4177.06]  to judge?
[4177.62 --> 4178.30]  The real
[4178.30 --> 4179.08]  question is,
[4179.42 --> 4179.90]  who are
[4179.90 --> 4181.28]  we to
[4181.28 --> 4181.60]  question
[4181.60 --> 4181.92]  God?
[4183.88 --> 4184.14]  And so
[4184.14 --> 4184.38]  we have
[4184.38 --> 4184.68]  to ask
[4184.68 --> 4184.96]  ourselves
[4184.96 --> 4185.52]  this question,
[4185.52 --> 4186.00]  are there
[4186.00 --> 4186.66]  times when
[4186.66 --> 4187.74]  I am
[4187.74 --> 4188.26]  questioning
[4188.26 --> 4188.78]  God in
[4188.78 --> 4189.30]  a sinful
[4189.30 --> 4189.70]  way?
[4191.12 --> 4191.32]  You know,
[4191.38 --> 4191.58]  sure,
[4191.72 --> 4192.20]  we can
[4192.20 --> 4192.54]  bring our
[4192.54 --> 4193.06]  questions to
[4193.06 --> 4193.34]  God,
[4193.86 --> 4194.24]  but some
[4194.24 --> 4195.14]  questions get
[4195.14 --> 4196.58]  not questions
[4196.58 --> 4197.16]  of honest
[4197.16 --> 4197.74]  curiosity,
[4198.20 --> 4198.76]  but questions
[4198.76 --> 4199.58]  of condemnation.
[4200.30 --> 4200.72]  Are we
[4200.72 --> 4201.36]  condemning
[4201.36 --> 4201.98]  God for
[4201.98 --> 4202.44]  who he
[4202.44 --> 4202.88]  is?
[4204.10 --> 4204.52]  Are there
[4204.52 --> 4205.06]  times when
[4205.06 --> 4205.76]  we say
[4205.76 --> 4206.14]  to God,
[4206.24 --> 4206.54]  what about
[4206.54 --> 4206.84]  this?
[4206.90 --> 4207.20]  What about
[4207.20 --> 4207.54]  that?
[4209.94 --> 4210.72]  When really
[4210.72 --> 4211.10]  the only
[4211.10 --> 4211.58]  appropriate
[4211.58 --> 4213.00]  response is
[4213.00 --> 4213.40]  to trust
[4213.40 --> 4213.66]  him,
[4214.06 --> 4214.50]  to trust
[4214.50 --> 4214.64]  him,
[4214.64 --> 4215.16]  even though
[4215.16 --> 4216.08]  he may
[4216.08 --> 4216.70]  never give
[4216.70 --> 4217.02]  you the
[4217.02 --> 4217.42]  answer
[4217.42 --> 4218.56]  you want,
[4218.60 --> 4219.10]  because he
[4219.10 --> 4219.62]  doesn't have
[4219.62 --> 4219.98]  to give
[4219.98 --> 4220.36]  you the
[4220.36 --> 4220.62]  answer
[4220.62 --> 4221.24]  you want.
[4221.88 --> 4222.26]  Sometimes
[4222.26 --> 4222.80]  in life,
[4222.86 --> 4223.16]  he does
[4223.16 --> 4223.44]  give you
[4223.44 --> 4223.80]  an answer,
[4223.84 --> 4223.98]  and you
[4223.98 --> 4224.28]  can look
[4224.28 --> 4224.64]  back,
[4224.68 --> 4224.84]  and you
[4224.84 --> 4225.12]  can say,
[4225.20 --> 4225.68]  I see
[4225.68 --> 4226.28]  what God
[4226.28 --> 4226.76]  was doing,
[4226.86 --> 4227.38]  I understand
[4227.38 --> 4227.92]  maybe what
[4227.92 --> 4228.34]  God was
[4228.34 --> 4228.64]  doing in
[4228.64 --> 4229.10]  my life,
[4229.14 --> 4229.64]  or how
[4229.64 --> 4229.98]  this is
[4229.98 --> 4230.30]  working,
[4230.58 --> 4231.60]  but sometimes
[4231.60 --> 4232.38]  he doesn't,
[4233.50 --> 4233.96]  and that's
[4233.96 --> 4234.76]  his prerogative,
[4234.94 --> 4235.42]  because he
[4235.42 --> 4235.88]  is God,
[4235.96 --> 4236.18]  and you
[4236.18 --> 4236.70]  are not,
[4237.76 --> 4238.12]  and we
[4238.12 --> 4238.48]  have no
[4238.48 --> 4238.92]  business
[4238.92 --> 4239.80]  questioning
[4239.80 --> 4240.88]  him in
[4240.88 --> 4241.24]  a sinful
[4241.24 --> 4241.60]  way.
[4242.88 --> 4243.44]  And if
[4243.44 --> 4244.02]  he wanted
[4244.02 --> 4244.36]  to,
[4244.48 --> 4244.74]  he could
[4244.74 --> 4245.22]  take each
[4245.22 --> 4245.62]  and every
[4245.62 --> 4246.04]  one of
[4246.04 --> 4246.44]  us,
[4246.80 --> 4247.18]  sit us
[4247.18 --> 4247.68]  down in
[4247.68 --> 4248.06]  a room,
[4248.24 --> 4248.88]  and question
[4248.88 --> 4249.36]  us.
[4250.52 --> 4251.20]  He could
[4251.20 --> 4252.08]  question every
[4252.08 --> 4253.06]  single minute
[4253.06 --> 4254.50]  of every
[4254.50 --> 4255.18]  single day
[4255.18 --> 4255.70]  what we
[4255.70 --> 4256.10]  have failed
[4256.10 --> 4256.70]  to do,
[4257.36 --> 4257.96]  for what
[4257.96 --> 4258.58]  we thought,
[4259.08 --> 4259.62]  for this,
[4259.76 --> 4260.44]  and for that.
[4260.62 --> 4261.00]  He could
[4261.00 --> 4261.74]  question us,
[4262.08 --> 4262.56]  but he
[4262.56 --> 4263.04]  doesn't.
[4264.10 --> 4264.60]  And yet,
[4265.04 --> 4265.76]  do we do
[4265.76 --> 4266.08]  that to
[4266.08 --> 4266.26]  him?
[4266.98 --> 4267.54]  Do we
[4267.54 --> 4268.26]  question him
[4268.26 --> 4268.66]  like that?
[4268.66 --> 4271.96]  only one
[4271.96 --> 4272.64]  person deserves
[4272.64 --> 4273.14]  to question,
[4273.34 --> 4273.58]  and that
[4273.58 --> 4274.00]  is God.
[4274.86 --> 4275.28]  And he
[4275.28 --> 4275.88]  asked you
[4275.88 --> 4276.44]  this question
[4276.44 --> 4277.04]  this morning,
[4277.76 --> 4278.24]  do you
[4278.24 --> 4279.02]  really believe
[4279.02 --> 4279.50]  that I
[4279.50 --> 4279.74]  am in
[4279.74 --> 4280.18]  the right
[4280.18 --> 4281.06]  and you
[4281.06 --> 4281.32]  are in
[4281.32 --> 4281.64]  the wrong?
[4282.60 --> 4283.10]  That's
[4283.10 --> 4283.52]  the question
[4283.52 --> 4283.94]  that we
[4283.94 --> 4284.68]  have to
[4284.68 --> 4285.52]  wrestle with
[4285.52 --> 4286.10]  and answer.
[4287.26 --> 4287.78]  God,
[4287.98 --> 4288.96]  I am
[4288.96 --> 4289.16]  in the
[4289.16 --> 4289.44]  wrong,
[4290.04 --> 4291.32]  you
[4291.32 --> 4292.02]  are in
[4292.02 --> 4292.84]  the right.
[4293.22 --> 4293.90]  That is
[4293.90 --> 4294.30]  the truth
[4294.30 --> 4294.98]  about us.
[4294.98 --> 4296.22]  And that
[4296.22 --> 4296.56]  is where
[4296.56 --> 4297.10]  we have
[4297.10 --> 4297.58]  to start
[4297.58 --> 4298.18]  with God.
[4299.04 --> 4299.62]  And that
[4299.62 --> 4299.96]  is why
[4299.96 --> 4300.62]  we need
[4300.62 --> 4301.52]  the empty
[4301.52 --> 4302.38]  hands of
[4302.38 --> 4302.76]  faith.
[4304.02 --> 4304.90]  We don't
[4304.90 --> 4305.40]  bring to
[4305.40 --> 4306.16]  God our
[4306.16 --> 4306.56]  own
[4306.56 --> 4307.20]  righteousness
[4307.20 --> 4308.76]  or our
[4308.76 --> 4309.06]  own
[4309.06 --> 4309.78]  self-made
[4309.78 --> 4310.42]  salvation,
[4310.72 --> 4311.48]  our ways
[4311.48 --> 4312.26]  of distinguishing
[4312.26 --> 4312.96]  us from
[4312.96 --> 4313.72]  other people.
[4313.94 --> 4314.54]  We bring
[4314.54 --> 4315.06]  to God
[4315.06 --> 4315.78]  our empty
[4315.78 --> 4316.42]  hands of
[4316.42 --> 4317.88]  faith to
[4317.88 --> 4318.76]  receive his
[4318.76 --> 4319.20]  son.
[4320.00 --> 4320.56]  And when we
[4320.56 --> 4321.24]  receive the
[4321.24 --> 4321.86]  righteousness of
[4321.86 --> 4322.22]  Christ,
[4322.38 --> 4323.02]  we just
[4323.02 --> 4323.60]  close our
[4323.60 --> 4324.32]  hands on
[4324.32 --> 4324.74]  him,
[4324.74 --> 4325.32]  and we
[4325.32 --> 4325.98]  hold on
[4325.98 --> 4326.82]  to him,
[4327.36 --> 4328.78]  and we
[4328.78 --> 4329.18]  offer him
[4329.18 --> 4329.68]  to others.
[4330.96 --> 4331.60]  So let me
[4331.60 --> 4332.12]  pray that God
[4332.12 --> 4332.60]  would help us
[4332.60 --> 4333.02]  do that.
[4333.70 --> 4334.32]  And I
[4334.32 --> 4334.72]  like, you
[4334.72 --> 4334.92]  know, I
[4334.92 --> 4335.34]  want to
[4335.34 --> 4336.40]  give you a
[4336.40 --> 4337.72]  chance to
[4337.72 --> 4338.40]  respond to
[4338.40 --> 4338.88]  whatever you
[4338.88 --> 4339.46]  feel from
[4339.46 --> 4339.90]  his word
[4339.90 --> 4340.26]  that God
[4340.26 --> 4340.58]  is saying
[4340.58 --> 4340.92]  to you.
[4340.98 --> 4341.18]  So I
[4341.18 --> 4341.38]  just want
[4341.38 --> 4341.54]  to give
[4341.54 --> 4341.74]  you a
[4341.74 --> 4342.76]  moment to
[4342.76 --> 4343.40]  quietly,
[4343.76 --> 4344.10]  silently,
[4344.58 --> 4344.90]  pray to
[4344.90 --> 4345.46]  God, ask
[4345.46 --> 4345.98]  him to
[4345.98 --> 4346.98]  apply his
[4346.98 --> 4347.86]  word to
[4347.86 --> 4348.44]  your heart,
[4349.08 --> 4349.56]  and then I
[4349.56 --> 4350.22]  will close
[4350.22 --> 4350.48]  us in
[4350.48 --> 4350.66]  prayer.
[4354.74 --> 4369.52]  O Lord, I
[4369.52 --> 4370.30]  pray that you
[4370.30 --> 4370.82]  would grant
[4370.82 --> 4371.22]  that every
[4371.22 --> 4371.82]  single one
[4371.82 --> 4372.56]  of us here
[4372.56 --> 4374.12]  this morning
[4374.12 --> 4376.10]  may leave
[4376.10 --> 4376.82]  here knowing
[4376.82 --> 4378.00]  and rejoicing
[4378.00 --> 4379.54]  that yes,
[4379.60 --> 4380.32]  I belong
[4380.32 --> 4381.76]  to Christ,
[4382.26 --> 4382.92]  that my
[4382.92 --> 4383.86]  sin is
[4383.86 --> 4384.62]  washed away,
[4384.98 --> 4385.76]  that my
[4385.76 --> 4386.50]  new life
[4386.50 --> 4387.28]  has started,
[4388.28 --> 4388.74]  and that
[4388.74 --> 4389.20]  yes, Lord,
[4389.26 --> 4390.22]  I am yours
[4390.22 --> 4391.02]  for time
[4391.02 --> 4391.76]  and eternity,
[4392.52 --> 4393.42]  that yes,
[4393.54 --> 4393.96]  Lord, you
[4393.96 --> 4395.22]  are my
[4395.22 --> 4395.56]  Savior,
[4395.68 --> 4395.94]  that you
[4395.94 --> 4396.30]  are my
[4396.30 --> 4396.66]  God,
[4397.06 --> 4397.40]  that you
[4397.40 --> 4397.80]  are my
[4397.80 --> 4398.36]  Lord,
[4398.88 --> 4399.18]  that you
[4399.18 --> 4399.50]  are my
[4399.50 --> 4399.98]  life,
[4401.42 --> 4401.78]  and may
[4401.78 --> 4402.30]  God in
[4402.30 --> 4402.84]  his mercy
[4402.84 --> 4403.52]  grant it
[4403.52 --> 4404.58]  so,
[4405.12 --> 4405.64]  for Jesus
[4405.64 --> 4406.08]  sake.
[4406.76 --> 4407.08]  Amen.
[4410.32 --> 4411.28]  Let's
[4411.28 --> 4411.62]  stand,
[4411.86 --> 4412.26]  and we
[4412.26 --> 4412.82]  will sing
[4412.82 --> 4413.22]  a song
[4413.22 --> 4414.04]  of response
[4414.04 --> 4414.38]  and praise
[4414.38 --> 4414.68]  to God.
[4414.68 --> 4414.72]  Amen.

[4734.40 --> 4748.58]  So this is the time in our service when we bring our tithes and offerings in total freedom, with gratitude, and with joy to God as a response to his mercy for us.
[4749.18 --> 4757.18]  Our designated offering that we have each Sunday is organized by our deacons, is today for Chaplain and Refugee Support Mobilizer.
[4757.18 --> 4769.10]  This is a ministry out of First Vancouver, First CRC, and that engages with refugee claimants and seeks to help them.
[4769.72 --> 4776.72]  So let's consider with thankful hearts the amazing and costly love of God for us as we give.
[4777.26 --> 4780.04]  And may I invite the deacons to come forward to collect the morning offering.
[4787.18 --> 4817.16]  Thank you.
[4817.18 --> 4819.18]  Thank you.
[4819.18 --> 4820.18]  Thank you.

[4832.18 --> 4837.18]  Thank you.
[4837.18 --> 4857.18]  Thank you.
[4857.18 --> 4867.32]  need
[4868.96 --> 4872.96]  just
[4872.96 --> 4882.96]  I am the Lord who saved me, and I am the Lord who saved me.
[4882.96 --> 4888.96]  I surrender all.
[4888.96 --> 4894.96]  I surrender all.
[4894.96 --> 4904.96]  How I will be my Lord who saved me.
[4904.96 --> 4912.96]  How I surrender all.
[4912.96 --> 4919.96]  How I will be my Lord who saved me.
[4919.96 --> 4927.96]  How I will be my Son for me.
[4927.96 --> 4934.96]  Fill me with my love and power.
[4934.96 --> 4941.96]  And I will be a son of a man.
[4941.96 --> 4947.96]  How I surrender all.
[4947.96 --> 4953.96]  How I surrender all.
[4953.96 --> 4959.96]  How I surrender all.
[4959.96 --> 4963.96]  How I surrender all.
[4963.96 --> 4967.96]  How I surrender all.
[4967.96 --> 4973.96]  How I surrender all.
[4973.96 --> 4977.96]  How I surrender all.
[4977.96 --> 4983.96]  How I surrender all.
[4983.96 --> 4995.96]  How I surrender all.
[4995.96 --> 4999.96]  How I surrender all.
[4999.96 --> 5016.12]  So would you join me in prayer as we come to our Heavenly Father who loves us
[5016.12 --> 5019.02]  and who wants to hear from us. Let's pray together.
[5020.76 --> 5028.32]  Oh God, we worship you. We acclaim you. You are the King of the universe. You are sovereign over all.
[5028.32 --> 5036.40]  And we rejoice that we can address you as our Father because you have reconciled us to yourself
[5036.40 --> 5040.34]  through the death and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5040.42 --> 5045.66]  And you have given us the gift of the Holy Spirit to create that new life in our hearts
[5045.66 --> 5050.98]  that we might freely respond to you in faith and in repentance.
[5052.06 --> 5057.44]  And Lord, we do so not on our own merits but on the merits of your Son Jesus.
[5058.32 --> 5064.24]  And we pray therefore in his name and we pray therefore with boldness.
[5065.14 --> 5071.88]  Lord, you call us as your people to continue steadfastly in prayer and to be watchful in it.
[5073.00 --> 5074.74]  And so Lord, we do come to you in prayer.
[5074.88 --> 5081.26]  And Lord, we pray for not only our own nation but indeed for the whole world.
[5081.26 --> 5085.64]  Lord, would you bless it with peace and with flourishing.
[5086.08 --> 5091.80]  Would you equip all leaders of the world, all those who influence others,
[5092.08 --> 5095.42]  to serve towards those ends.
[5096.42 --> 5101.58]  Looking forward to that day when you will come again and you will renew all things.
[5101.58 --> 5109.20]  Lord, we pray particularly for the freedom of your people around the world to worship you
[5109.20 --> 5111.12]  and to proclaim your good news.
[5111.32 --> 5115.48]  Lord, would you preserve those freedoms in our own country
[5115.48 --> 5117.88]  and would you extend them around the world.
[5119.44 --> 5122.72]  And Lord, we know even this morning that many are gathered in your name
[5122.72 --> 5126.44]  doing the very things that we do but under the threat of violence,
[5127.12 --> 5129.40]  of arrest, of persecution.
[5130.44 --> 5133.18]  And so Lord, we pray for these brothers and sisters this morning
[5133.18 --> 5136.44]  that you would strengthen them, that you would encourage them,
[5136.78 --> 5140.62]  and that you would fill them with the sure hope of your eternal kingdom.
[5140.62 --> 5145.74]  Lord, we pray for them even as they walk sometimes more closely than we do
[5145.74 --> 5148.70]  in the suffering footsteps of our Lord Jesus.
[5150.18 --> 5154.16]  Lord, we rejoice that our citizenship ultimately is in heaven.
[5155.70 --> 5159.20]  And we pray, Lord, also for the work and the mission of your church.
[5159.34 --> 5164.16]  Lord, we thank you for Dina Nikolai and her work among refugee claimants in Vancouver
[5164.16 --> 5170.40]  as she daily has an opportunity to share the hope of the gospel.
[5170.62 --> 5178.48]  Lord, would you use her to be a blessing to many people who are seeking a home?
[5179.46 --> 5185.88]  And would they find ultimately, Lord, their home in knowing you and in belonging to you?
[5186.58 --> 5192.74]  Lord, would you encourage Dina and make her fruitful in the work that you have given her to do?
[5193.12 --> 5196.86]  When she, Lord, comes across challenges and frustrations,
[5197.28 --> 5200.16]  Lord, we pray that you would make her her way smooth.
[5201.50 --> 5208.58]  Lord, we especially this morning lift up to you in prayer our sister Winnie
[5208.58 --> 5214.98]  and her family, their children, Lord, as they mourn the loss of Ernst.
[5216.14 --> 5220.92]  Even, Lord, as we rejoice that he has moved from one degree of glory to another,
[5220.92 --> 5230.78]  and even now as we worship you without seeing, but he worships you face to face.
[5232.82 --> 5235.42]  But, Lord, even so, we mourn those we lose.
[5235.52 --> 5240.04]  And so would you be with Winnie and her whole family as they mourn in this season?
[5240.72 --> 5245.00]  Lord, would you fill them with the comfort of your presence and the hope of eternal glory?
[5245.00 --> 5249.98]  Lord, we pray for little Noah McRae as he goes in for surgery on Monday.
[5250.80 --> 5254.78]  Would you be with the doctors as they operate on his mouth?
[5255.16 --> 5257.08]  And would the surgery, Lord, be successful?
[5257.94 --> 5262.82]  Would you help Noah after a successful surgery to heal well,
[5263.02 --> 5265.38]  and that there wouldn't be any complications?
[5266.08 --> 5267.74]  And, Lord, would you keep him in your care?
[5267.74 --> 5272.44]  Lord, we pray for all of those in our midst who are suffering and sick.
[5273.18 --> 5274.50]  Would you comfort your people?
[5275.26 --> 5276.14]  Would you bring healing?
[5276.32 --> 5277.08]  Would you bring hope?
[5277.92 --> 5283.38]  Indeed, would you fill us with a great assurance of the resurrection of Christ
[5283.38 --> 5286.10]  as we walk this path of our earthly pilgrimage?
[5287.30 --> 5291.02]  Lord, you are able to do far more abundantly than all that we can ask and think,
[5291.06 --> 5292.90]  and we pray that you would do so.
[5293.84 --> 5297.10]  Lord, help us in our daily lives to live for your glory,
[5297.10 --> 5301.22]  to proclaim not ourselves and not any other human being,
[5301.36 --> 5302.78]  but Christ Jesus as Lord.
[5303.74 --> 5306.76]  Would you equip us as a church to love one another well
[5306.76 --> 5312.40]  and do so in the way of your Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[5312.52 --> 5316.26]  And, Lord, now we pray in the way that our Savior taught us to pray,
[5317.06 --> 5318.36]  praying together the Lord's Prayer.
[5319.32 --> 5321.52]  Our Father who art in heaven,
[5322.32 --> 5323.68]  hallowed be thy name.
[5324.32 --> 5325.32]  Thy kingdom come,
[5325.88 --> 5326.90]  thy will be done.
[5327.10 --> 5329.06]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[5329.72 --> 5332.12]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[5332.98 --> 5334.52]  And forgive us our trespasses
[5334.52 --> 5337.72]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[5338.48 --> 5340.18]  And lead us not into temptation,
[5340.64 --> 5342.06]  but deliver us from evil.
[5342.68 --> 5344.00]  For thine is the kingdom,
[5344.44 --> 5345.04]  and the power,
[5345.50 --> 5346.82]  and the glory forever.
[5347.48 --> 5347.84]  Amen.
[5347.84 --> 5348.84]  Let's all stand.
[5348.84 --> 5349.96]  Let's all stand.
[5349.96 --> 5350.96]  And in our worship,
[5350.96 --> 5353.14]  and in our worship,
[5353.14 --> 5356.26]  God has the first word as he calls us to worship him,
[5356.38 --> 5358.06]  and he has the last word.
[5358.30 --> 5362.84]  And it's a good word as he sends us out with his blessing upon us.
[5362.84 --> 5365.10]  But before I do that,
[5365.62 --> 5368.52]  please join us for a time of coffee and fellowship in the Fellowship Hall.
[5368.86 --> 5372.80]  Don't forget to sign up to be an Advent candlelighter and reader.
[5372.80 --> 5376.98]  And now I invite you to hold out your hands to receive God's blessing.
[5377.72 --> 5379.34]  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5380.02 --> 5383.22]  May he lift up his face upon you and be gracious to you.
[5383.30 --> 5386.28]  May he turn his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[5386.66 --> 5386.98]  Amen.
[5386.98 --> 5387.08]  Amen.
[5416.28 --> 5419.20]  Lord, you will be our shepherd.
[5419.58 --> 5422.86]  We will act for you again.
[5423.22 --> 5429.24]  For you take us to the pastors that are being.
[5431.02 --> 5433.86]  Leave these signs to the waters.
[5434.24 --> 5437.40]  Bring me fresh ink to our souls.
[5437.86 --> 5443.08]  As you guide us in the paths that make us free.
[5443.08 --> 5446.90]  We are.
[5450.90 --> 5452.98]  We are.
[5458.98 --> 5462.72]  Though we walk through dust our path,
[5462.94 --> 5466.20]  we will see the weak of pain.
[5466.20 --> 5472.36]  You bring comfort in the presence of our foes.
[5473.08 --> 5478.90]  You will burn our hands through holiness and mercy.
[5478.90 --> 5480.90]  We will see the dust now.
[5480.90 --> 5486.90]  As we dwell in your house forevermore.
[5486.90 --> 5492.72]  We are.
[5492.72 --> 5494.72]  We are.
[5494.72 --> 5496.72]  We are.
[5496.72 --> 5498.72]  We are.
[5498.72 --> 5500.72]  We are.
[5500.72 --> 5501.48]  Sing that again.
[5501.48 --> 5503.50]  We are.
[5503.50 --> 5504.30]  We are.
[5504.30 --> 5505.30]  You will.
[5505.30 --> 5507.30]  We are.
[5507.30 --> 5508.30]  We are.
[5508.30 --> 5509.30]  We are.
[5509.30 --> 5516.30]  For you bring us to the church that we're free.
[5516.30 --> 5523.30]  Lead these signs to your heart, bring these fresh into our hearts.
[5523.30 --> 5530.30]  As your God has said, we must let you know free.
[5530.30 --> 5545.30]  Lead these signs to your heart, bring these fresh into our hearts.
[5545.30 --> 5552.30]  Though He walked in the dark, He will fear the healing.
[5552.30 --> 5560.30]  And He will wonder in the presence of our Lord.
[5560.30 --> 5567.30]  You have heard our heads before the abyss of mercy on His feet.
[5567.30 --> 5574.30]  As we dwell in the house for evermore.
[5574.30 --> 5589.30]  Lead these signs to your heart.
[5589.30 --> 5596.30]  Lead these signs to your heart.
[5596.30 --> 5601.58]  I love him to go!
[5602.58 --> 5606.02]  I love him to go!
[5607.50 --> 5609.92]  I love him to go!
[5611.76 --> 5616.42]  Even though I want you to be better than what you need.
[5617.34 --> 5622.94]  I love his truth.
[5622.94 --> 5625.82]  When can I get so manygenommen?
[5626.30 --> 5656.28]  Thank you.
