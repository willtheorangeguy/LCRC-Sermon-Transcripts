• The Jewish Christians were expected to welcome strangers and teach them about God's law.
• Paul asked them if they practiced what they preached, pointing out hypocrisy in their actions vs their words.
• Hypocrisy is a problem that everyone faces when trying to obey God's law.
• Breaking the law, even in thought or intention, dishonors God and damages one's witness.
• The consequences of hypocrisy can be seen in how others view Christianity.
• The question for Christians is whether they are living out their faith honestly and consistently.
• Paul's message to the Jews in Rome about relying on God's word (the Bible) for salvation
• The second way the Jews were trying to exclude themselves from God's judgment: claiming circumcision
• Circumcision as a sign of covenant status and its purpose in Abraham's time
• The problem with circumcision: it cannot save those who break the law
• The sign of circumcision becomes meaningless if the reality of a person's life does not reflect their covenant relationship with God.
• Paul argues that the Jews had misunderstood the significance of circumcision as a guarantee of their status before God, rather than a sign of their relationship with Him.
• If Gentiles keep the law and worship God truly, they are doing what circumcision is a sign of, which is being joined to God and in relationship with Him.
• The relationship between the listeners and God
• Baptism as a sign of God's covenant in the New Testament
• The difference between being a member of a church and truly being saved by faith in Jesus

• Circumcision of the heart, not just physical
• Paul's interpretation of being a Jew: inwardly a Jew, with spiritual reality
• Physical things (circumcision, law) are signs and reminders of relationship with God
• What matters is internal reality, not external signs
