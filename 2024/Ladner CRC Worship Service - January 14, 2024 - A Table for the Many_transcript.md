[291.00 --> 292.00]  Good morning.
[292.00 --> 293.00]  Good morning.
[293.00 --> 294.00]  My name is Jason Truel.
[294.00 --> 297.00]  I want to welcome you to Latin or Christian Reformed Church.
[297.00 --> 301.00]  It is a joy to worship the Lord together with you this morning.
[301.00 --> 304.00]  Before we begin, just a few announcements.
[304.00 --> 310.00]  One is that this afternoon at 2.30 we will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[310.00 --> 316.00]  That's a senior's home and so it would be great to join for that.
[316.00 --> 320.00]  This afternoon we meet directly there at Mountain View at 2.30.
[320.00 --> 333.00]  Also, this coming Friday we are having a gathering of churches in South Delta where we will be gathering to pray together.
[333.00 --> 341.00]  To pray for our city, to pray for those who serve in our city, to pray for families and youth and other things.
[341.00 --> 345.00]  And so we will be gathering at Sacred Heart Parish on Arthur Drive.
[345.00 --> 348.00]  And you can come at 6.30 for a time of worship.
[348.00 --> 354.00]  And then also we will be having a time where we all pray together as the churches of South Delta.
[354.00 --> 355.00]  So that's on Friday.
[355.00 --> 362.00]  And then on Sunday we begin our winter cross training.
[362.00 --> 368.00]  This is adult education discipleship classes where our class will begin on Sunday.
[368.00 --> 371.00]  And the topic is on angels.
[371.00 --> 375.00]  So you can sign up for that on the foyer table.
[375.00 --> 377.00]  So that's all for announcements.
[377.00 --> 384.00]  This is the second season in the second Sunday in the church season of Epiphany.
[384.00 --> 393.00]  So having anticipated the coming of Christ in Advent and then celebrated the arrival of Jesus in Christmas,
[393.00 --> 400.00]  we now turn to the revealing of the person and work of Jesus in the season of Epiphany.
[400.00 --> 403.00]  And that's what the word Epiphany means.
[403.00 --> 406.00]  It means revelation or to reveal.
[406.00 --> 412.00]  Jesus Christ has been revealed as the Savior of the whole world.
[412.00 --> 418.00]  And so the gospel, God's grace is for all people everywhere.
[418.00 --> 423.00]  And he calls his people from every tongue and tribe and nation to worship him.
[423.00 --> 425.00]  And so let's do that together this morning.
[425.00 --> 428.00]  Please join me in the call to worship.
[428.00 --> 431.00]  The words will be on the screen behind me.
[434.00 --> 437.00]  So I'll begin and we'll read it responsibly.
[437.00 --> 443.00]  Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
[443.00 --> 453.00]  For in him, all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
[453.00 --> 457.00]  All things have been created through him and for him.
[457.00 --> 463.00]  He is before all things and in him, all things hold together.
[463.00 --> 468.00]  And he is the head of the body, the church.
[468.00 --> 472.00]  He is the beginning in the firstborn from among the dead.
[472.00 --> 477.00]  So that in everything, he might have the supremacy.
[477.00 --> 482.00]  For God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him.
[482.00 --> 491.00]  And through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,
[491.00 --> 496.00]  by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.
[496.00 --> 498.00]  Let's join in a prayer of adoration.
[498.00 --> 500.00]  Let's pray together.
[500.00 --> 507.00]  Almighty God, we worship you, our creator and our redeemer.
[507.00 --> 511.00]  Would you be here with us in this time of worship this morning?
[511.00 --> 521.00]  And as we sing, as we pray, as we adore, as we confess, as we hear your word read and preached,
[521.00 --> 534.00]  please create in us by the gracious working of your spirit, clean hands, pure hearts, and rightly ordered wills, so that we might go out renewed.
[534.00 --> 545.00]  And grant that your people, O Lord, may shine with the radiance of Christ's glory, that he may be known and worshipped and obeyed to the ends of the earth.
[545.00 --> 555.00]  We pray through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who with you in the Holy Spirit lives and reigns one God, now and forever. Amen.
[555.00 --> 562.00]  Let's stand and hear God's greeting to us this morning from Psalm 36.
[562.00 --> 567.00]  How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
[567.00 --> 570.00]  People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[570.00 --> 573.00]  They feast on the abundance of your house.
[573.00 --> 578.00]  You give them drink from your river of delights.
[578.00 --> 583.00]  Let's turn and let's greet those around us now.
[583.00 --> 584.00]  week and all these evenings.
[584.00 --> 586.00]  Wedogs bring together these two th 요 series in order for yesterday's dinner.

[608.00 --> 608.32]  temed
[608.32 --> 631.76]  Good morning.
[631.76 --> 631.82]  Good morning.
[631.82 --> 638.40]  And as we join our congregations together, we've got a combined worship team this morning.
[638.68 --> 645.26]  And so just as we did in December, the words that you understand on the screen, go ahead
[645.26 --> 645.72]  and sing.
[646.16 --> 651.80]  Leadership from the platform will alternate in Chinese and English, but we'll just enjoy
[651.80 --> 652.78]  these songs together.
[652.78 --> 656.38]  And the first one is, This is My Father's World.
[661.82 --> 691.80]  This is My Father's World.
[691.80 --> 712.14]  This is My Father's World.
[712.14 --> 716.96]  The birds their carols praise.
[717.44 --> 726.28]  The morning light, the lily white, declare their Maker's praise.
[726.28 --> 731.10]  This is My Father's World.
[731.10 --> 735.52]  He shines in all that fair.
[735.52 --> 740.82]  The rustling brass, I hear Him ask.
[740.82 --> 744.52]  He speaks to me everywhere.
[744.52 --> 749.52]  This is My Father's World.
[749.52 --> 755.18]  The Lord where slit zaczynsule Him.

[787.48 --> 788.48]  Amen.
[790.48 --> 793.24]  This next song, I Lift Your Name
[793.24 --> 797.48]  goes through some of the names of Christ,
[797.48 --> 800.24]  Jehovah, God, and the Father.
[800.24 --> 803.54]  the great I am, the risen lamb, the comforter and king,
[803.92 --> 807.06]  a song of assurance of who goes with us in this new year
[807.06 --> 809.90]  through all of our life's experiences
[809.90 --> 812.62]  and the forgiveness that he offers.
[830.24 --> 833.22]  Sing together.
[833.22 --> 837.78]  Lord, my heart can be grown
[837.78 --> 843.30]  So far away and cold
[843.30 --> 851.62]  And yet for me your love is still the same
[851.62 --> 858.10]  Lord, I bend my knee
[858.10 --> 862.76]  In awe and fear of thee
[862.76 --> 871.50]  My head bowed down in reverence to your name
[871.50 --> 877.82]  I lift your name
[877.82 --> 882.44]  Your holy name
[882.44 --> 889.10]  Jehovah God, Elohim
[889.10 --> 896.78]  The great I am
[896.78 --> 901.48]  The risen lamb
[901.48 --> 908.10]  My comforter and king
[908.10 --> 914.76]  Lord, my heart's desire
[914.76 --> 921.10]  Is to be filled with spirit and fire
[921.10 --> 927.34]  My purpose is to worship you alone
[927.34 --> 934.00]  Open up my soul
[934.00 --> 938.90]  To worship and adore
[938.90 --> 946.00]  To be a friend, friend, offer to your throne
[946.00 --> 952.66]  I lift your name
[952.66 --> 953.66]  I lift your name
[953.66 --> 957.66]  Your holy name
[957.66 --> 963.66]  Jehovah God, Elohim
[963.66 --> 968.32]  The great I am
[968.32 --> 972.32]  The great I am
[972.32 --> 976.32]  The risen lamb
[976.32 --> 984.32]  My comforter and king
[984.32 --> 990.98]  I lift your name
[990.98 --> 995.64]  Your holy name
[995.64 --> 1001.64]  Jehovah God, Elohim
[1001.64 --> 1009.30]  The great I am
[1009.30 --> 1012.30]  The risen lamb
[1012.30 --> 1021.30]  My comforter and king
[1021.30 --> 1051.28]  The great I am
[1051.28 --> 1052.52]  Page 248
[1052.52 --> 1065.92]  So we are reading 2 Kings
[1065.92 --> 1068.04]  Chapter 4 verses 1-7
[1068.04 --> 1072.12]  Then we'll jump ahead to verses 42-44
[1072.12 --> 1074.58]  I am in 1 Kings
[1074.58 --> 1082.52]  Yeah, that's the wrong page number
[1082.52 --> 1087.18]  Okay, 2-7-2
[1087.18 --> 1088.58]  If you'd like to read along
[1088.58 --> 1090.28]  Page 2-7-2
[1090.28 --> 1093.06]  2 Kings chapter 4
[1093.06 --> 1094.70]  Verses 1-7
[1094.70 --> 1101.40]  The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha
[1101.40 --> 1104.78]  Your servant, my husband, is dead
[1104.78 --> 1108.00]  And you know that he revered the Lord
[1108.00 --> 1112.92]  But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves
[1112.92 --> 1117.38]  And he said, I'm going to take my two boys as his slaves
[1117.38 --> 1120.70]  Tell me, what do you have in your house?
[1121.38 --> 1126.50]  Your servant has nothing there at all, she said, except a little oil
[1126.50 --> 1131.96]  Elisha said, go around and ask all of your neighbors for empty jars
[1131.96 --> 1134.34]  Don't ask for just a few
[1134.34 --> 1138.62]  Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons
[1138.62 --> 1141.12]  Pour oil into all the jars
[1141.12 --> 1144.76]  And as each is filled, put it to one side
[1144.76 --> 1146.36]  She left him
[1146.36 --> 1149.94]  And afterward shut the door behind her and her sons
[1149.94 --> 1153.20]  They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring
[1153.20 --> 1155.78]  When all the jars were full
[1155.78 --> 1158.60]  She said to her son, bring me another one
[1158.60 --> 1161.60]  But he replied, there is not a jar left
[1161.60 --> 1164.04]  Then the oil stopped flowing
[1164.04 --> 1166.72]  She went and told the man of God
[1166.72 --> 1171.04]  And he said, go, sell the oil and pay your debts
[1171.04 --> 1174.52]  You and your sons can live on what is left
[1174.52 --> 1179.40]  Then we'll look forward to verses 42 through 44
[1179.40 --> 1183.40]  A man came from Baal, Shalisha
[1183.40 --> 1185.56]  Bringing the man of God
[1185.56 --> 1187.68]  Twenty loaves of barley bread
[1187.68 --> 1189.84]  Baked from the first ripe grain
[1189.84 --> 1192.16]  Along with some heads of new grain
[1192.16 --> 1195.74]  Give it to the people to eat, Elisha said
[1195.74 --> 1198.82]  How can I set this before a hundred men?
[1199.14 --> 1200.04]  His servant asked
[1200.04 --> 1201.84]  But Elisha answered
[1201.84 --> 1203.92]  Give it to the people to eat
[1203.92 --> 1205.96]  For this is what the Lord says
[1205.96 --> 1208.56]  They will eat and have some leftover
[1208.56 --> 1210.88]  Then he said it before them
[1210.88 --> 1213.76]  And they ate and had some leftover
[1213.76 --> 1215.98]  According to the word of the Lord
[1215.98 --> 1217.52]  Thanks be to God
[1217.52 --> 1235.08]  Is it our confession of assurance section?
[1235.32 --> 1236.28]  No
[1236.28 --> 1243.42]  According to my cheek
[1243.42 --> 1247.02]  And now
[1247.02 --> 1250.00]  We come to a time of confession
[1250.00 --> 1253.40]  Now as we do this
[1253.40 --> 1254.92]  As we come to this time of confession
[1254.92 --> 1258.16]  I think our hearts
[1258.16 --> 1260.52]  Can be in different places
[1260.52 --> 1263.40]  You know some of us may be thinking
[1263.40 --> 1265.62]  Why are we doing this?
[1265.94 --> 1267.10]  What's the point?
[1268.32 --> 1271.26]  Some of us may be feeling spiritual amnesia
[1271.26 --> 1272.74]  You know the sense of
[1272.74 --> 1275.42]  What do I have to confess?
[1275.92 --> 1276.60]  I kind of forget
[1276.60 --> 1278.88]  How I've sinned against God and others
[1278.88 --> 1279.54]  Throughout the week
[1279.54 --> 1282.36]  Some of us may be overwhelmed
[1282.36 --> 1284.38]  With other burdens and suffering
[1284.38 --> 1287.52]  That even coming this morning
[1287.52 --> 1288.56]  Feels like a miracle
[1288.56 --> 1291.00]  You know we have enough problems
[1291.00 --> 1293.24]  On our mind already
[1293.24 --> 1296.82]  And some of us may actually be filled
[1296.82 --> 1298.86]  With shame for the sins
[1298.86 --> 1299.78]  That we know
[1299.78 --> 1301.16]  That we have been living in
[1301.16 --> 1303.44]  And maybe we don't want to come
[1303.44 --> 1304.48]  Before God
[1304.48 --> 1307.70]  And the beautiful thing about our God
[1307.70 --> 1309.50]  Is that no matter where our hearts
[1309.50 --> 1310.60]  Are this morning
[1310.60 --> 1312.96]  He already knows
[1312.96 --> 1315.00]  He knows our thoughts
[1315.00 --> 1316.86]  He knows our hearts
[1316.86 --> 1318.84]  And he invites us
[1318.84 --> 1320.16]  To come before him
[1320.16 --> 1321.28]  Truthfully
[1321.28 --> 1324.58]  To step into his light
[1324.58 --> 1326.82]  To open up our hearts to him
[1326.82 --> 1328.48]  And so
[1328.48 --> 1330.50]  What I want to do today for confession
[1330.50 --> 1332.56]  Is actually just to give us a time
[1332.56 --> 1334.00]  Of silence
[1334.00 --> 1335.16]  Where each one of us
[1335.16 --> 1335.84]  I want to invite you
[1335.84 --> 1337.38]  Just to come before the Lord
[1337.38 --> 1339.42]  With whatever is going on
[1339.42 --> 1340.22]  In your hearts
[1340.22 --> 1341.26]  And in your minds
[1341.26 --> 1342.98]  And just pray before him
[1342.98 --> 1344.34]  Ask him to meet you
[1344.34 --> 1345.02]  Where you are
[1345.02 --> 1346.24]  And then we will hear
[1346.24 --> 1347.20]  Words of assurance
[1347.20 --> 1348.22]  So let's pray
[1348.22 --> 1349.22]  Okay
[1349.22 --> 1351.16]  Okay
[1351.16 --> 1351.48]  giants
[1351.48 --> 1381.46]  Thank you.
[1381.48 --> 1411.46]  Thank you.
[1412.04 --> 1417.12]  Lord, for the ways that we have sinned against you this week, Lord, whether they are fresh
[1417.12 --> 1422.26]  on our minds or whether we've already kind of moved past them, Lord, we confess them
[1422.26 --> 1422.64]  to you.
[1423.14 --> 1429.00]  We ask for your forgiveness and we celebrate it, that we have received it when we come
[1429.00 --> 1431.30]  to you in Christ.
[1432.00 --> 1437.70]  Lord, we ask that you would renew us, that we would follow you and trust in you.
[1437.82 --> 1438.84]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1439.04 --> 1439.28]  Amen.
[1440.18 --> 1444.82]  So let's hear these words of grace now and say these words responsibly from Psalm 103.
[1444.82 --> 1451.34]  The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
[1452.38 --> 1459.16]  He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1459.16 --> 1464.84]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1465.72 --> 1472.86]  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1472.86 --> 1474.96]  Thanks be to God.
[1476.40 --> 1477.84]  All right, now we can sing.
[1478.52 --> 1479.40]  That was my fault.
[1479.48 --> 1480.32]  I read the bulletin wrong.
[1480.62 --> 1482.30]  Let's all stand and let's sing together.
[1482.30 --> 1512.28]  Let's sing together.
[1512.30 --> 1542.28]  Let's sing together.
[1542.30 --> 1572.28]  Let's sing together.
[1572.30 --> 1602.28]  Let's sing together.
[1602.28 --> 1632.26]  Let's sing together.
[1632.26 --> 1634.26]  Let's sing together.
[1634.26 --> 1651.50]  Long my praise and spirit lay, that thou gave in sin and nature's night.
[1651.50 --> 1668.96]  My night infused a clear faith, I followed the dungeon with blood.
[1668.96 --> 1686.34]  My chains fell off, my heart was free, I followed and followed, and followed me.
[1686.34 --> 1704.76]  Amazing love, how can it be, that for thy Lord, children die for me?
[1704.76 --> 1709.86]  Long my muse ży近��, who hardship lay, that for our Velvet runtime.

[1739.50 --> 1769.48]  Thank you.
[1769.50 --> 1778.80]  For to worship, to your faith was still.
[1781.80 --> 1782.90]  Amen.
[1799.50 --> 1817.14]  So brothers and sisters, we now come to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1817.86 --> 1822.50]  And this table is a table of surprising grace.
[1823.04 --> 1824.92]  It's a table of costly grace.
[1825.56 --> 1827.98]  And it's a table of abundant grace.
[1828.94 --> 1841.02]  It's surprising because the God of the whole universe would humbly come and take on flesh, dwell among us, and die for us.
[1841.18 --> 1841.78]  Surprising.
[1841.78 --> 1853.32]  It's costly that this infinite God would humble himself even unto death on a cross in order to give his life to us.
[1853.54 --> 1854.74]  It is costly.
[1856.26 --> 1858.44]  And friends, it's a table of abundant grace.
[1859.08 --> 1864.46]  Because this table is for all who would trust in Christ for salvation.
[1864.72 --> 1868.48]  As many as the Lord our God would call to himself.
[1868.48 --> 1878.20]  So Christ invites all of his baptized people who trust in Christ as their Savior to dine at his table.
[1878.84 --> 1890.66]  If this is not yet your faith, we encourage you to use this time to reflect on the abundant, surprising, and costly grace that Jesus invites you into.
[1890.66 --> 1896.36]  And so let me pray and ask for God's blessing upon this meal.
[1896.46 --> 1897.26]  Let's pray together.
[1898.54 --> 1902.18]  Our Heavenly Father, send forth your Holy Spirit.
[1902.86 --> 1909.62]  So that this bread and cup may be for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1909.62 --> 1919.16]  Father, as we come to your table, would you prepare each one of our hearts to receive you by faith.
[1920.06 --> 1928.10]  And may we and all of your saints be united with Christ and remain faithful in hope and love.
[1928.92 --> 1932.06]  Gather your whole church, O Lord, into the glory of your kingdom.
[1932.06 --> 1936.64]  And bless this meal to the glory of your name and the good of your people.
[1937.24 --> 1939.80]  We ask in Christ's name. Amen.
[1941.84 --> 1948.18]  So the words of institution that I want to say today come from the Gospel of Luke, chapter 22.
[1948.96 --> 1950.12]  Where it says this.
[1950.12 --> 1980.10]  Brothers and sisters, let's say this.
[1980.12 --> 1983.82]  Say our communion liturgy together on the next slide.
[1984.36 --> 1985.42]  Lift up your hearts.
[1986.16 --> 1987.94]  We lift them up to the Lord.
[1988.64 --> 1990.22]  We are his people.
[1991.00 --> 1993.50]  We are redeemed by his grace.
[1994.18 --> 1996.64]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1997.58 --> 1998.74]  Christ has died.
[1999.28 --> 2000.44]  Christ is risen.
[2001.10 --> 2002.70]  Christ will come again.
[2003.64 --> 2006.60]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[2007.04 --> 2007.40]  Hallelujah.
[2007.40 --> 2007.60]  Hallelujah.
[2008.40 --> 2008.88]  Hallelujah.
[2009.78 --> 2013.20]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[2013.70 --> 2014.32]  Take them.
[2015.02 --> 2018.58]  Feed on him by faith with great thanksgiving and joy,
[2019.08 --> 2023.64]  knowing and trusting and believing that Christ died for you.
[2024.70 --> 2030.14]  May I ask our elders to come up and help me to distribute the elements.
[2030.14 --> 2037.64]  Let's pray.
[2038.24 --> 2057.66]  four

[4340.40 --> 4341.40]  Thank you.
[4341.40 --> 4342.40]  Thank you.
[4342.40 --> 4343.40]  Thank you.
[4343.40 --> 4345.40]  Thank you.
[4345.40 --> 4346.40]  Yourself We С значит–
[4346.40 --> 4348.20]  that you have a blessed This is based on the world
[4348.20 --> 4348.40]  of is複itzing.
[4348.40 --> 4350.80]  This is a world in which God is present and He is active and He is faithful and He is uh,
[4350.80 --> 4352.40]  примерно, right?
[4352.40 --> 4353.40]  in a world of isdeacając and He is faithful and He is generous, and He can bring forth abundance,
[4353.40 --> 4354.40]  even in desolate places.
[4354.40 --> 4359.42]  And friends, this should be incredibly encouraging to everyone.
[4359.42 --> 4367.30]  every one of us, right? That our inadequacy or our lack is never a barrier to us going out and
[4367.30 --> 4374.38]  serving and ministering to others. In fact, it's our inadequacy, it's our coming before God,
[4374.44 --> 4382.52]  whether it's with our money or our abilities or our time or whatever it is, coming before God,
[4382.60 --> 4388.02]  saying, God, I don't have much. It doesn't seem like it's enough. I need it for myself.
[4388.02 --> 4396.34]  But we come to him with our five loaves and two fish, and that is a prerequisite for doing God's
[4396.34 --> 4403.84]  work, right? If you are, if you have it all, then maybe that's actually not how God wants to use us.
[4404.56 --> 4410.38]  But if we're willing to trust Jesus with what we do have, no matter how meager it may seem,
[4410.60 --> 4416.98]  and if we're willing to bring it to him, he will bless it and he will multiply it and use it for
[4416.98 --> 4426.14]  his glory. So friends, Jesus is, who is he? He is the bread of life. He is the bread at the center
[4426.14 --> 4431.64]  of our table, at the center of our lives, and he invites us to share the abundance of Jesus
[4431.64 --> 4439.42]  with a world that is hungry, so that a hungry world could be deeply satisfied also in him.
[4439.42 --> 4448.88]  And that's the invitation of this text this morning. May God bless it upon us. So let's pray. Would you pray with me?
[4448.88 --> 4459.86]  Heavenly Father, we come to you knowing that what we bring to you is so small and so meager oftentimes.
[4459.86 --> 4467.32]  We know that our fishes and our loaves are never enough unless we bring them to you.
[4468.44 --> 4475.42]  And Lord, when we fear and when we doubt and we throw up our hands and say impossible to the things
[4475.42 --> 4483.02]  that you invite us into, would you help us to know your gracious presence and your gracious
[4483.02 --> 4489.50]  provision. And may we turn to you, Jesus, and find our true nourishment in you alone,
[4490.38 --> 4493.18]  the bread of heaven. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4495.14 --> 4499.00]  Let's all stand and let's sing our song of response. We will feast in the house of Zion.
[4513.02 --> 4532.40]  We will feast in the house of Zion. We will sing with our hearts restored. He has done great things.
[4532.58 --> 4540.38]  We will say together, we will feast and we go home.
[4543.02 --> 4573.00]  We will feast in the house of Zion. We will sing with our hearts restored.
[4573.02 --> 4586.70]  We will sing with our hearts restored. He has done great things. We will sing together. We will feast and we go home.
[4586.70 --> 4594.14]  In the dark of night before the dawn
[4594.14 --> 4598.64]  My soul be not afraid
[4598.64 --> 4604.04]  For the promised morning home alone
[4604.04 --> 4611.76]  O God, take of me my strength
[4611.76 --> 4617.16]  We will feast in the house of dying
[4617.16 --> 4622.02]  We will sing with our hearts restored
[4622.02 --> 4627.16]  He has done great things we will say together
[4627.16 --> 4633.26]  We will feast and we go home
[4633.26 --> 4640.20]  Every vow we've broken, every dream
[4640.20 --> 4645.14]  Are the faithful ones
[4645.14 --> 4650.04]  That from the garden to the grave
[4650.04 --> 4655.70]  Find us together, bring shalom
[4655.70 --> 4662.60]  We will feast in the house of dying
[4662.60 --> 4667.54]  We will sing with our hearts restored
[4667.54 --> 4672.48]  He has done great things we will say together
[4672.48 --> 4679.38]  We will feast and we go home
[4679.38 --> 4698.44]  So we will continue to worship the Lord
[4698.44 --> 4701.16]  I feel very insecure now about the order
[4701.16 --> 4703.78]  I think, ah yes, there it is
[4703.78 --> 4706.88]  With the giving of our tithes and our offerings this morning
[4706.88 --> 4711.12]  And our designated offering is for Reframe Ministries
[4711.12 --> 4714.26]  I also want to take this opportunity
[4714.26 --> 4717.22]  To draw your attention in our bulletin
[4717.22 --> 4719.06]  To what Mel provides for us
[4719.06 --> 4722.16]  Which is a summary of the donations
[4722.16 --> 4726.16]  And the reason I'm going to draw your attention to this
[4726.16 --> 4728.16]  Because it's kind of like the feeding of the 5000
[4728.16 --> 4731.38]  There is an overabundance of giving
[4731.38 --> 4734.52]  From this congregation in December
[4734.52 --> 4736.52]  It's absolutely astonishing
[4736.52 --> 4740.30]  And so I just want to praise God
[4740.30 --> 4742.12]  And invite all of us to praise God
[4742.12 --> 4744.36]  For the generosity of this congregation
[4744.36 --> 4746.70]  And so thank you
[4746.70 --> 4749.64]  And could I also now have the deacons
[4749.64 --> 4751.76]  And invite the deacons to collect our morning offering
[4751.76 --> 4762.54]  piano plays softly
[4762.54 --> 4763.54]  Amen.
[4792.54 --> 4793.54]  Amen.
[4822.54 --> 4823.54]  Amen.
[4852.54 --> 4853.54]  Amen.
[4882.54 --> 4883.54]  Amen.
[4883.54 --> 4884.54]  Amen.
[4884.54 --> 4885.54]  Amen.
[4889.54 --> 4898.54]  Okay, so let's go now before the Lord in prayer for our community here and for our world.
[4898.54 --> 4899.54]  Let's pray together.
[4899.54 --> 4904.54]  And we will conclude as we usually do with the Lord's Prayer.
[4904.54 --> 4911.54]  Father in heaven, you rule, you reign over all the earth.
[4911.54 --> 4922.40]  Yet also, Lord, you take unbounded time to listen to the individual requests of each and every one of your people.
[4923.28 --> 4925.34]  You are the good shepherd.
[4926.48 --> 4930.44]  So hear us now as we bring our petitions unto you.
[4931.18 --> 4937.72]  And Lord, there are so many needs and so many hurts in our world, even in our own lives.
[4937.72 --> 4946.80]  And so, Lord, help us to know and to respond to your call to help meet a need of those around us.
[4947.56 --> 4951.20]  And Lord, we also do so through prayer.
[4951.40 --> 4954.84]  And so, Lord, we pray, Father, for those among us who are ill.
[4956.46 --> 4960.18]  We pray for those facing cancer.
[4961.12 --> 4965.74]  We pray for those facing also loss and grief.
[4965.74 --> 4971.10]  We pray for those who are lonely, who are in care homes.
[4972.26 --> 4978.46]  We pray for those who are facing decisions that seem to be beyond them.
[4979.92 --> 4987.42]  Pray for those who are having trouble in relationships, perhaps at work or at school or at home.
[4987.42 --> 5001.10]  And who need the freedom that comes through the gospel of having a relationship with you through your son, Jesus Christ.
[5001.48 --> 5003.72]  And through the working and the power of the spirit.
[5003.72 --> 5009.16]  And Lord, we pray for those beyond our walls as well.
[5009.40 --> 5015.02]  Even those in our city, but also in our province, our country, and our world.
[5015.82 --> 5025.56]  Lord, we pray for those who feel the terror of hunger and of homelessness, of war, of oppression, and of suffering of all different types.
[5025.56 --> 5030.70]  May they know the comfort of your deep love and sovereign grace.
[5031.20 --> 5034.88]  That they may endure and even prosper.
[5035.62 --> 5045.32]  Knowing, Lord, that you are good and that all things are for, ultimately, your glory and the good of the saints.
[5045.32 --> 5050.40]  We think primarily also, Lord, of the war in Gaza.
[5051.46 --> 5053.84]  Of the earthquakes in Japan.
[5054.10 --> 5055.60]  Of conflict in the Red Sea.
[5057.18 --> 5062.16]  But Lord, there are many places that need your touch in deep and powerful ways.
[5063.80 --> 5067.82]  Our God, we do not presume to know your will and what is best for us.
[5067.82 --> 5078.16]  And so we offer these prayers, asking you to listen and, Lord, to act as only you see fit.
[5078.26 --> 5080.80]  In the power of your spirit, for the glory of your name.
[5081.62 --> 5087.26]  And we pray these things coming to you only because our Lord Jesus Christ made it possible.
[5087.60 --> 5089.24]  Through the blood of his cross.
[5089.88 --> 5092.04]  And saying the prayer that he taught us.
[5092.90 --> 5093.86]  Saying together.
[5093.86 --> 5094.86]  Amen.
[5123.86 --> 5127.56]  All right, let's stand and we will go out with God's good words upon us.
[5127.86 --> 5129.14]  The benediction or the blessing.
[5130.22 --> 5134.92]  And please join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall right after.
[5135.04 --> 5138.42]  And again, we have our hospital singing at 2.30.
[5138.72 --> 5141.76]  The hospital, the Mountain View Care Home at 2.30.
[5142.88 --> 5144.96]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[5145.86 --> 5149.44]  The love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.
[5150.44 --> 5151.92]  Now and forever.
[5151.92 --> 5152.68]  Amen.
[5154.86 --> 5155.86]  Amen.
[5155.86 --> 5157.30]  Amen.
[5157.30 --> 5158.40]  Amen.
