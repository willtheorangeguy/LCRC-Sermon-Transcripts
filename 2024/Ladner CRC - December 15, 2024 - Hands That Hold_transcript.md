[1799.76 --> 1829.76]  Thank you.
[1829.76 --> 1859.76]  Thank you.
[1859.76 --> 1889.76]  Thank you.
[1889.76 --> 1919.76]  Thank you.
[1919.76 --> 1949.76]  Thank you.
[1949.76 --> 1979.76]  Thank you.
[1979.76 --> 2009.74]  Thank you.
[2009.76 --> 2039.74]  Thank you.
[2039.76 --> 2069.76]  Thank you.
[2069.76 --> 2099.76]  Thank you.
[2099.76 --> 2107.32]  the work of God's hands. This is God's grace to them. And when the baby arrives, holding, you know,
[2107.38 --> 2117.52]  holding any kind of baby is remarkable. But holding your first, your own, is a surreal experience.
[2118.84 --> 2125.12]  And at this point, as I was preparing this message, I was so tempted to show you lots of baby pictures
[2125.12 --> 2131.60]  of my daughter, Ellie, who was my firstborn. But I realized that it is much more enjoyable for the
[2131.60 --> 2138.66]  parents than it is for the people who must politely look at the photos. So we won't do that. But when
[2138.66 --> 2145.72]  Ellie was born, I got to hold her in my hands, and it was the most amazing thing. Every birth feels
[2145.72 --> 2154.38]  astounding, but this birth was far from ordinary, right? Remember, Elizabeth was already very old,
[2154.38 --> 2161.32]  and she was barren, not able to conceive. And so this baby and the birth of this child echoed an
[2161.32 --> 2168.96]  extraordinary series of births in Israel's history, right? Going all the way back to Abraham and Sarah
[2168.96 --> 2176.86]  of God miraculously providing a child. And it was emphasizing this truth that God would achieve
[2176.86 --> 2186.42]  his salvation in his own way so that all would know that it was he who did it, and that it is his salvation.
[2188.30 --> 2193.94]  And the news that they would have a child in their old age had been announced to them by an angel
[2193.94 --> 2197.72]  to Zechariah as he was serving as priest in the temple.
[2197.72 --> 2205.88]  But Zechariah doesn't believe it. And so the angel strikes him dumb. He's not able to talk.
[2206.82 --> 2210.56]  And he will listen. You know, he would not listen to the voice of God.
[2210.86 --> 2217.06]  So he is forced to listen to the voice of God. He is put into a nine-month silent treatment.
[2217.06 --> 2227.64]  At this point in the story, in our text, nine months have passed. Elizabeth, in her old age,
[2228.14 --> 2235.32]  has given birth to a son, and it's a boy. And though you wouldn't have heard Zechariah's voice,
[2235.50 --> 2243.30]  still, the scene here is not quiet. Because the neighbors and the family, they have all come to
[2243.30 --> 2250.92]  celebrate. So in verse 58, we read, her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her
[2250.92 --> 2260.44]  great mercy, and they shared her joy. There was great rejoicing in the home of Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[2260.96 --> 2268.84]  The baby had arrived. They held him, the promise of God, they held him in their hands. He could fit
[2268.84 --> 2274.82]  in their hands, literally. And they showed him around to all of these neighbors and relatives.
[2275.42 --> 2280.96]  Probably passed him around. You know, you can imagine the neighbors and their relatives as they
[2280.96 --> 2287.92]  see this miraculous child saying things like, he has Elizabeth's eyes. Right? Aren't they beautiful?
[2288.92 --> 2296.84]  Or he has Zechariah's smile. That's great. He has Zechariah's nose.
[2296.84 --> 2304.64]  Well, I guess that's okay. But there's so much rejoicing and delight in the savoring of the
[2304.64 --> 2312.84]  fulfillment of God's promises to them. This child is Zechariah and Elizabeth's everything.
[2314.10 --> 2320.64]  He is their hope, their future, their pride, their joy, their long-awaited treasure. They had been
[2320.64 --> 2325.84]  praying for a child for most of their lives. But especially, remember, in first century Jewish
[2325.84 --> 2333.66]  culture, your kids, especially your male children, are everything. They are your retirement plan.
[2334.46 --> 2339.72]  Right? When the ones who will take care of you when you're old. They are your status in the community.
[2340.48 --> 2347.32]  And they are also the way that you participate in the future covenant promises of God's people.
[2347.32 --> 2359.38]  And so this baby is everything to Zechariah and Elizabeth. Now I wonder what you have in your hands
[2359.38 --> 2369.84]  right now that you can hold and with gladness and delight lift up to God in celebration. To hold in
[2369.84 --> 2380.30]  celebration, maybe like Mufasa does in the Lion King. Let's praise God for the wonderful gifts that we get
[2380.30 --> 2389.70]  to hold in our hands. That we can celebrate and that we can be grateful to God for. So that's the hands
[2389.70 --> 2398.62]  that hold. But the second hand posture that we find in our story is hands that let go. Okay, that's our
[2398.62 --> 2406.96]  second point. And so let's return to our text in verse 59. This is what it says. On the eighth day,
[2407.14 --> 2412.78]  they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him after his father, Zechariah.
[2414.22 --> 2419.10]  That's what usually happened. Right? Circumcision on the eighth day according to God's commandment to
[2419.10 --> 2426.24]  Abraham. Right? That would mark him as a member of God's covenant community outwardly.
[2427.84 --> 2432.90]  And the relatives and the neighbors, they just assumed that Zechariah and Elizabeth would name
[2432.90 --> 2440.12]  their baby Zechariah after his dad. He would be Zechariah Jr. Right? That's what was customary.
[2440.12 --> 2449.40]  But let's have a look at verse 60. His mother spoke up and said, no, he is to be called John.
[2452.50 --> 2461.00]  Now this was their child, of course. But this was not only their child. Right? Zechariah had been told
[2461.00 --> 2466.58]  that, you know, this child belonged to God. The angel Gabriel said to Zechariah,
[2466.58 --> 2475.00]  there would be a son and you are to call him John. He will be great before the Lord. Many would
[2475.00 --> 2481.50]  rejoice at his birth, not just them. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit while in Elizabeth's
[2481.50 --> 2487.18]  womb and he would turn the hearts of Israel to God. He would prepare the way of the Lord.
[2488.28 --> 2494.74]  All of this was outside their control. Right? Those things were outside of their hands.
[2494.74 --> 2503.28]  And Zechariah, he had nine months of silence to reflect on that. To think about that. To ponder
[2503.28 --> 2510.52]  that. To come to accept it. Right? As the baby grew and as it developed in Elizabeth's womb,
[2511.28 --> 2522.48]  Zechariah, day by day, realized that John is not just for him and Elizabeth. John is not just for him
[2522.48 --> 2531.32]  to hold on to as much as he would want to. And as Zechariah, you know, you can imagine him replaying
[2531.32 --> 2538.64]  that conversation with the angel over and over, excuse me, over and over in his mind. As he did that,
[2538.72 --> 2548.18]  he knew one thing, that they had to name this child John. Zechariah begins to see that he has to have
[2548.18 --> 2558.56]  hands that let go. And so in this act of submission and surrender to God, they give this boy the name
[2558.56 --> 2569.02]  that they did not choose, but that God chose. So verse 61, they said to her, there is no one among
[2569.02 --> 2575.90]  your relatives who has that name. Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like
[2575.90 --> 2583.34]  to name the child. He asked for his writing tablet, you know, apple seed minus 3000 or something.
[2584.48 --> 2594.14]  And to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, his name is John. He calls him John, letting go of the one
[2594.14 --> 2600.46]  right and privilege that he had as a father concerning the birth of his son. Letting go,
[2600.46 --> 2607.92]  perhaps, of his dreams of having a little Zechariah running about the house. Right? After he got to
[2607.92 --> 2615.88]  hold his son, he realizes that he has to let his son go. Zechariah's hands that get to hold become
[2615.88 --> 2622.58]  hands that have to let go. And this period of silence for Zechariah, it seems to have been symbolic
[2622.58 --> 2630.40]  because as a priest, his job was speaking. He was to proclaim the word of the Lord. He was to bless.
[2630.40 --> 2638.80]  He was to pronounce. But God turns his microphone off. And in those nine months of silence, he loses
[2638.80 --> 2647.74]  his primary identity in his work as a priest. Maybe he was on sick leave, or perhaps they had just given
[2647.74 --> 2656.40]  him some menial, non-speaking tasks to do. But in those nine months, something begins to happen in
[2656.40 --> 2666.34]  his heart. He first, he didn't believe the angel. But slowly, Zechariah learns to let go and to surrender.
[2667.14 --> 2674.74]  Right? He surrenders his own life, and he surrenders his son's life as well. Right? All the dreams that
[2674.74 --> 2680.70]  he had of, you know, being able to be that main voice in his son's life. Right? Of being maybe a
[2680.70 --> 2689.48]  normal dad to a normal son. He had to let that go. John was not going to be an average child.
[2690.42 --> 2698.72]  He would eat locusts and honey, we are told. He would be dressed with clothing made of camel's hair.
[2698.72 --> 2707.26]  He was going to be a straight-talking, sharp-shooter who lived and loved the wilderness.
[2708.76 --> 2715.00]  This is going to be a challenge for Zechariah and Elizabeth to accept. And indeed, if the early
[2715.00 --> 2720.18]  church tradition is correct, John's parents may not have had much time with him on earth at all.
[2720.18 --> 2725.94]  At the end of the chapter, chapter 1, verse 80, it says this,
[2726.80 --> 2733.72]  And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilderness, until he appeared
[2733.72 --> 2740.68]  publicly to Israel. So we're told that this child, John, is taken to the wilderness as a child.
[2741.42 --> 2747.62]  He stays there until he is ready to come out as a prophet in his adulthood.
[2747.62 --> 2753.36]  And so John is an answer to Zechariah and Elizabeth's prayers. He is a fulfillment.
[2754.54 --> 2757.52]  But even here, it's for God's purposes.
[2758.26 --> 2760.60]  More than just to be at home with mom and dad.
[2761.72 --> 2765.90]  You see, John was going to be like you would want a prophet to be.
[2766.00 --> 2769.88]  Like Jeremiah or Elijah.
[2770.12 --> 2773.32]  You know, kind of quirky, kind of cool, strong,
[2773.88 --> 2776.08]  spiritual man of God, kind of crazy.
[2776.08 --> 2780.76]  But not exactly what you would want your child to be.
[2782.34 --> 2785.50]  And maybe in that time of silence, Zechariah was being prepared
[2785.50 --> 2788.46]  not to step in and say things like,
[2788.82 --> 2792.08]  John, I've told you a hundred times, stop eating those locusts.
[2792.72 --> 2795.32]  You have a nice dinner right here for you.
[2797.08 --> 2798.54]  He's going to have to reign that in.
[2799.48 --> 2801.52]  He wasn't going to be the voice
[2801.52 --> 2810.86]  God had sent the one who was going to prepare the way of the Lord.
[2812.12 --> 2815.22]  But God first had to prepare the way in Zechariah's heart.
[2816.46 --> 2818.66]  And he was graciously doing that.
[2819.78 --> 2819.90]  Right?
[2819.90 --> 2823.12]  God wanted Zechariah not just to say fine,
[2823.32 --> 2824.66]  not just outward obedience.
[2825.70 --> 2829.32]  God wanted Zechariah's open hands of surrender.
[2830.16 --> 2834.78]  God wanted Zechariah's heart to let go of his son
[2834.78 --> 2836.68]  and of his own life.
[2837.26 --> 2838.06]  And that is hard.
[2839.50 --> 2841.42]  It's kind of like, you know, Mary and Joseph.
[2841.58 --> 2844.66]  Remember, they had to do the same with him.
[2844.72 --> 2847.06]  You know, when they lost him back in Jerusalem.
[2847.06 --> 2848.70]  So embarrassing, right?
[2848.76 --> 2849.86]  They're in a big city.
[2850.08 --> 2851.26]  They're traveling there.
[2851.62 --> 2852.46]  They leave.
[2852.54 --> 2854.50]  A couple days later, they're like, where's Jesus?
[2856.80 --> 2860.64]  But he was in the temple that he called his father's house.
[2861.14 --> 2863.38]  And suddenly they have to remember, like, oh yeah.
[2864.18 --> 2864.42]  Right?
[2864.46 --> 2865.40]  He's got a different home.
[2866.12 --> 2867.36]  He's got a different father.
[2868.14 --> 2869.38]  We need to let him go.
[2871.08 --> 2874.14]  And let me give you an example of my, from my own life.
[2874.14 --> 2878.14]  My daughter Ellie just recently passed her driving test
[2878.14 --> 2879.32]  and she got her N.
[2880.12 --> 2880.38]  Yay.
[2882.06 --> 2884.02]  As a dad, I am so proud of her.
[2885.12 --> 2887.44]  But at the same time, what I really want to do
[2887.44 --> 2890.70]  is never let her get in that car.
[2893.44 --> 2893.84]  Right?
[2893.86 --> 2894.82]  I want to keep her close.
[2895.68 --> 2897.16]  It's hard to let go.
[2897.16 --> 2901.82]  But if I hold on too tightly, it's not good for her.
[2902.24 --> 2902.46]  Right?
[2902.52 --> 2902.98]  Or for me.
[2903.06 --> 2904.06]  That's not being a good father.
[2905.46 --> 2906.54]  And my hands are limited.
[2907.36 --> 2909.30]  I have to surrender my own control
[2909.30 --> 2913.68]  and realize I only have her on trust from God.
[2914.74 --> 2914.94]  Right?
[2915.00 --> 2919.38]  That Christy and I are stewards of our kids.
[2919.38 --> 2921.04]  We have to let them go.
[2922.78 --> 2924.80]  And we will be better parents because of that.
[2925.92 --> 2926.06]  Right?
[2926.12 --> 2928.54]  We will be able to be,
[2928.90 --> 2930.68]  they will, so that they will be able to be
[2930.68 --> 2932.64]  who God plans them to be.
[2933.60 --> 2936.64]  And to do what God plans for them to do.
[2937.76 --> 2939.88]  And so let's turn the camera on ourselves as well.
[2939.88 --> 2945.08]  What might God be calling you to let go of?
[2946.96 --> 2949.54]  What might he be calling you to surrender?
[2951.00 --> 2952.62]  And not just outward obedience,
[2953.70 --> 2956.00]  but what does he want to do in your heart?
[2957.12 --> 2957.28]  Right?
[2957.36 --> 2959.56]  What is your heart hoping in,
[2959.92 --> 2961.66]  grasping onto right now?
[2963.08 --> 2964.06]  You know, for Zechariah,
[2964.16 --> 2966.18]  his microphone was taken away.
[2966.18 --> 2970.08]  He loses his voice as a priest and as a father.
[2971.28 --> 2974.42]  For us, it might be the steering wheel of our lives
[2974.42 --> 2976.64]  to decide what our lives will look like.
[2977.36 --> 2980.74]  Or what social calendar we like to have.
[2980.86 --> 2983.46]  Or what family and friends we wish we could have.
[2983.70 --> 2985.96]  Or a body that works perfectly.
[2986.68 --> 2988.22]  Or whatever it is we hope in.
[2989.94 --> 2992.18]  What grip of your hands
[2992.18 --> 2994.10]  needs to be gently opened by God?
[2994.10 --> 2996.54]  What are you calling to surrender
[2996.54 --> 2998.18]  like John had to do with,
[2998.28 --> 3000.44]  or Zechariah had to do with John
[3000.44 --> 3002.46]  as he loses his job, his identity,
[3002.82 --> 3005.34]  his power, his expectations, his hopes.
[3008.88 --> 3009.36]  Right?
[3009.40 --> 3012.44]  We are called to have hands that open and let go.
[3013.42 --> 3015.54]  And that leads us to our third point this morning.
[3016.42 --> 3017.92]  So we have hands that hold,
[3018.02 --> 3019.30]  we have hands that let go,
[3019.30 --> 3022.58]  but we also have hands that do not let go.
[3024.10 --> 3025.14]  But they're not our hands.
[3025.80 --> 3027.18]  They are the hands of the Lord.
[3028.92 --> 3031.48]  So when we are willing to let go of what,
[3032.34 --> 3034.16]  of that which we are holding on to,
[3034.26 --> 3036.54]  it's actually a willingness to give those things
[3036.54 --> 3037.94]  to God,
[3038.86 --> 3039.94]  into God's hands.
[3040.88 --> 3041.94]  So the author,
[3042.26 --> 3043.20]  David Benner,
[3043.34 --> 3045.42]  he has a book called Surrender to Love.
[3046.48 --> 3048.60]  And here's just a short quote
[3048.60 --> 3050.02]  of what he says in that book.
[3050.02 --> 3051.76]  He says,
[3052.10 --> 3055.52]  only God deserves absolute surrender
[3055.52 --> 3060.36]  because only God can offer dependable love.
[3061.12 --> 3065.08]  No other love is worthy of our surrender.
[3067.14 --> 3069.74]  Surrender to love.
[3070.48 --> 3071.72]  That's what we're called to do.
[3071.84 --> 3073.62]  Surrender is not just giving up,
[3073.62 --> 3076.46]  it's letting go,
[3076.58 --> 3079.14]  but then placing that which we treasure
[3079.14 --> 3080.50]  and that which we hope in
[3080.50 --> 3082.40]  into the hands of the Lord.
[3083.42 --> 3085.06]  Into the hands of perfect love.
[3086.48 --> 3086.66]  Right?
[3086.72 --> 3088.10]  It's letting go of our own grasp
[3088.10 --> 3090.50]  and giving it into God's grasp.
[3091.86 --> 3092.92]  And the promise of the Bible,
[3093.10 --> 3094.84]  the promise of Jesus coming,
[3095.04 --> 3097.98]  is that what you let go of
[3097.98 --> 3102.44]  will be in better hands than your own.
[3103.48 --> 3104.74]  What you let go of,
[3104.84 --> 3106.06]  what you entrust to God,
[3106.26 --> 3109.14]  will be in better hands than your own.
[3110.26 --> 3111.66]  And the good news is that
[3111.66 --> 3112.74]  Zechariah discovers
[3112.74 --> 3115.34]  that in surrendering his own desires,
[3115.52 --> 3117.26]  his own plans for his son's life
[3117.26 --> 3117.90]  and his life,
[3118.20 --> 3120.26]  he is releasing them into hands
[3120.26 --> 3121.96]  that are bigger and stronger
[3121.96 --> 3124.96]  and better than his own.
[3124.96 --> 3128.22]  The final line in our passage
[3128.22 --> 3130.08]  is a bit of a commentary from Luke.
[3130.50 --> 3131.82]  Verse 64.
[3133.72 --> 3134.20]  Immediately,
[3134.80 --> 3136.68]  his mouth was opened
[3136.68 --> 3138.24]  and his tongue set free,
[3138.70 --> 3139.62]  began to speak,
[3139.88 --> 3140.54]  praising God.
[3141.68 --> 3142.76]  All the neighbors
[3142.76 --> 3145.14]  were filled with awe
[3145.14 --> 3147.94]  and throughout the hill country of Judea,
[3148.08 --> 3149.56]  people were talking about
[3149.56 --> 3150.62]  all of these things.
[3150.98 --> 3151.96]  And then Luke gives us
[3151.96 --> 3154.06]  some commentary on John's life.
[3154.96 --> 3156.46]  He says in verse 46,
[3156.58 --> 3157.08]  or 66,
[3158.22 --> 3159.98]  everyone who heard this
[3159.98 --> 3161.24]  wondered about it,
[3161.30 --> 3161.64]  asking,
[3162.44 --> 3164.68]  what then is this child going to be
[3164.68 --> 3169.22]  for the Lord's hand was with him?
[3170.32 --> 3170.54]  Right?
[3170.60 --> 3171.62]  And notice what it says there.
[3172.08 --> 3173.42]  Whose hand was with him?
[3174.56 --> 3176.90]  The Lord's hand was with him.
[3177.74 --> 3178.36]  God's hand.
[3178.44 --> 3180.58]  Not primarily Zechariah's hands.
[3180.80 --> 3182.66]  Not primarily Elizabeth's hands.
[3182.66 --> 3185.00]  God's hand was with him.
[3188.12 --> 3188.78]  Zechariah's hands,
[3188.86 --> 3190.58]  they have to let go of his hope for John.
[3191.12 --> 3191.94]  But he finds
[3191.94 --> 3193.58]  that as he does,
[3194.10 --> 3195.88]  John is in better hands.
[3196.72 --> 3198.68]  Because God's hands are with him.
[3199.46 --> 3199.64]  You know,
[3199.68 --> 3200.36]  at one level,
[3200.46 --> 3200.96]  what's a hand?
[3201.02 --> 3201.72]  A hand is this,
[3201.76 --> 3201.88]  you know,
[3201.92 --> 3202.44]  wriggly thing
[3202.44 --> 3204.52]  that we have on our arms
[3204.52 --> 3206.94]  that is used for giving high fives
[3206.94 --> 3208.54]  and for other things.
[3209.48 --> 3210.24]  But of course,
[3210.32 --> 3211.46]  when we use this word hand,
[3211.56 --> 3212.88]  we also mean it in,
[3213.18 --> 3214.58]  more than a physical sense,
[3214.66 --> 3216.34]  we mean it in a metaphorical sense.
[3217.50 --> 3217.88]  You know,
[3218.00 --> 3219.36]  for like action,
[3219.66 --> 3220.56]  like give me a hand.
[3221.34 --> 3222.50]  Or for caring,
[3223.34 --> 3224.34]  hold my hand.
[3225.94 --> 3226.24]  You know,
[3226.28 --> 3226.82]  in the Bible,
[3226.94 --> 3228.50]  the hand of God means
[3228.50 --> 3230.50]  even something more profound.
[3230.72 --> 3231.86]  It stands for God's
[3231.86 --> 3233.44]  hand with you.
[3233.44 --> 3235.42]  His leading,
[3236.14 --> 3236.98]  His guiding,
[3237.58 --> 3238.64]  His encouraging,
[3238.92 --> 3239.66]  His protecting,
[3240.14 --> 3240.94]  His strengthening,
[3241.24 --> 3242.26]  and giving courage.
[3243.92 --> 3245.06]  And that is beautiful,
[3245.86 --> 3248.16]  but it's still far from easy.
[3249.16 --> 3250.42]  It would have been very hard
[3250.42 --> 3251.82]  for John's parents
[3251.82 --> 3254.06]  to give him into God's hands.
[3254.78 --> 3255.62]  Because, you know what,
[3255.68 --> 3256.64]  John was preparing
[3256.64 --> 3258.10]  the hearts of Israel
[3258.10 --> 3258.86]  for something new.
[3259.38 --> 3260.76]  Something that they didn't expect.
[3260.88 --> 3262.20]  Something they weren't ready for.
[3262.20 --> 3263.54]  That's what his job was.
[3264.42 --> 3265.66]  And he was not going to do it
[3265.66 --> 3267.76]  by cuddling them into change.
[3268.32 --> 3270.20]  He was going to prod them
[3270.20 --> 3271.22]  with the truth.
[3271.96 --> 3274.14]  He was going to ruffle feathers.
[3274.74 --> 3276.60]  He was going to call the Pharisees
[3276.60 --> 3279.10]  a brood of vipers.
[3280.62 --> 3281.68]  And John's head
[3281.68 --> 3283.70]  finally would be put on a platter.
[3285.16 --> 3287.06]  He's literally beheaded
[3287.06 --> 3289.04]  because of his ministry.
[3289.04 --> 3291.86]  And so Zechariah's surrender
[3291.86 --> 3293.96]  was costly.
[3294.92 --> 3296.64]  It would have been hard
[3296.64 --> 3297.92]  on his heart.
[3299.04 --> 3300.22]  And that's a challenge
[3300.22 --> 3300.88]  for us as well.
[3300.96 --> 3302.02]  What if God grants you
[3302.02 --> 3303.04]  your wishes and your hopes?
[3303.10 --> 3304.10]  He answers your prayers.
[3304.64 --> 3305.60]  And then they turn out
[3305.60 --> 3306.48]  to be for His kingdom.
[3308.22 --> 3308.58]  Right?
[3308.62 --> 3309.64]  What if your child grows up
[3309.64 --> 3310.28]  to be a missionary?
[3312.58 --> 3314.06]  What if your child grows up
[3314.06 --> 3314.74]  to be a martyr?
[3315.74 --> 3317.24]  Someone who dies for the faith.
[3317.24 --> 3318.84]  Right?
[3318.90 --> 3320.22]  The Lord can grant us
[3320.22 --> 3320.98]  great blessings
[3320.98 --> 3322.54]  and then He asks us
[3322.54 --> 3325.16]  to give those blessings away
[3325.16 --> 3326.80]  for His kingdom.
[3327.98 --> 3328.98]  And so we might ask then,
[3329.22 --> 3330.04]  well, can I trust
[3330.04 --> 3330.82]  the hands of God?
[3334.24 --> 3335.54]  And the answer is yes.
[3337.34 --> 3339.14]  His are not the kinds of hands
[3339.14 --> 3340.70]  that will say
[3340.70 --> 3341.82]  life's going to be easy.
[3342.52 --> 3343.88]  But they are the hands
[3343.88 --> 3344.40]  that say,
[3344.82 --> 3345.52]  I am with you.
[3345.52 --> 3345.84]  Right?
[3347.12 --> 3348.36]  My hand is with you.
[3348.44 --> 3349.68]  My hand is on you
[3349.68 --> 3350.88]  no matter what.
[3352.04 --> 3353.34]  You are in my purposes
[3353.34 --> 3354.70]  no matter what.
[3356.40 --> 3356.88]  You know,
[3356.94 --> 3357.96]  Jesus was talking about
[3357.96 --> 3358.88]  His own sheep
[3358.88 --> 3360.66]  in John chapter 10
[3360.66 --> 3361.28]  verse 28
[3361.28 --> 3362.78]  when He says this,
[3362.86 --> 3364.36]  I give them eternal life
[3364.36 --> 3365.70]  and they shall never perish.
[3366.04 --> 3367.54]  No one will snatch them
[3367.54 --> 3369.32]  out of my hand.
[3370.86 --> 3371.28]  Right?
[3371.34 --> 3372.48]  No matter what plan
[3372.48 --> 3374.22]  God has for our lives,
[3374.22 --> 3375.28]  for our children's lives,
[3375.34 --> 3376.14]  or anything,
[3376.94 --> 3378.12]  when we give those things
[3378.12 --> 3379.14]  into His hands,
[3380.58 --> 3382.48]  His hands are better
[3382.48 --> 3383.26]  than our own.
[3384.28 --> 3385.14]  How can we know
[3385.14 --> 3385.74]  that to be true?
[3385.84 --> 3387.46]  How can we trust that?
[3389.32 --> 3390.18]  Well, John Newton,
[3390.40 --> 3391.68]  the former slave trader
[3391.68 --> 3393.28]  who was forever changed
[3393.28 --> 3394.10]  by the hand of God
[3394.10 --> 3394.96]  in his own life,
[3395.26 --> 3396.08]  he wrote this,
[3396.08 --> 3398.34]  how unspeakably wonderful
[3398.34 --> 3398.98]  to know
[3398.98 --> 3400.52]  that all our concerns
[3400.52 --> 3401.24]  are held
[3401.24 --> 3402.42]  in hands
[3402.42 --> 3403.80]  that bled for us.
[3405.86 --> 3406.24]  Right?
[3406.30 --> 3408.20]  How unspeakably wonderful
[3408.20 --> 3409.08]  to know
[3409.08 --> 3410.26]  that all of our concerns,
[3410.50 --> 3411.58]  all of our lives,
[3412.00 --> 3412.88]  all of our hopes
[3412.88 --> 3413.52]  and dreams,
[3413.64 --> 3414.20]  our fears,
[3414.58 --> 3415.52]  our expectations,
[3416.00 --> 3418.10]  they are all held
[3418.10 --> 3419.82]  in the hands
[3419.82 --> 3422.10]  that bled for us.
[3422.10 --> 3425.04]  And so let's let go
[3425.04 --> 3426.06]  of those things
[3426.06 --> 3426.80]  in our lives
[3426.80 --> 3428.12]  that we are to let go of
[3428.12 --> 3430.30]  and surrender them to God
[3430.30 --> 3432.02]  because they are
[3432.02 --> 3432.94]  in better hands.
[3434.12 --> 3435.24]  And as we let go
[3435.24 --> 3436.18]  of our own lives
[3436.18 --> 3436.92]  and we surrender them
[3436.92 --> 3437.30]  to God,
[3437.38 --> 3437.88]  we know
[3437.88 --> 3439.36]  that they are firmly held
[3439.36 --> 3439.90]  in hands
[3439.90 --> 3440.94]  that won't let us go
[3440.94 --> 3442.36]  and in hands
[3442.36 --> 3443.08]  that bled for you.
[3444.26 --> 3445.12]  So let's pray.
[3449.82 --> 3450.66]  I just want to give you
[3450.66 --> 3451.00]  a moment
[3451.00 --> 3451.98]  to pray silently.
[3452.10 --> 3453.50]  to the Lord
[3453.50 --> 3455.08]  responding to anything
[3455.08 --> 3455.68]  that he has put
[3455.68 --> 3456.20]  on your heart.
[3470.16 --> 3470.94]  Heavenly Father,
[3471.04 --> 3471.70]  we are grateful
[3471.70 --> 3473.66]  that you are a God
[3473.66 --> 3474.78]  who holds us
[3474.78 --> 3476.52]  in your stronger
[3476.52 --> 3477.56]  and better hands.
[3478.50 --> 3478.74]  Lord,
[3478.82 --> 3479.32]  we thank you
[3479.32 --> 3479.90]  for all
[3479.90 --> 3481.48]  that you give us
[3481.48 --> 3482.24]  and we recognize
[3482.24 --> 3482.80]  that all of it
[3482.80 --> 3483.78]  is yours as well.
[3484.52 --> 3485.30]  And so we hold
[3485.30 --> 3486.78]  these things loosely.
[3487.84 --> 3488.52]  And we ask
[3488.52 --> 3489.40]  that you would use us,
[3489.52 --> 3490.32]  use our lives
[3490.32 --> 3491.90]  and all the things
[3491.90 --> 3493.50]  that you give us
[3493.50 --> 3494.18]  for your kingdom
[3494.18 --> 3494.68]  and the glory
[3494.68 --> 3495.24]  of your name.
[3495.52 --> 3496.72]  We pray in Jesus' name
[3496.72 --> 3497.58]  and for his sake.
[3497.90 --> 3498.16]  Amen.
[3500.70 --> 3501.56]  Let's all stand
[3501.56 --> 3502.54]  and sing our song
[3502.54 --> 3503.10]  and we'll sing
[3503.10 --> 3504.20]  and we'll sing
[3504.20 --> 3505.10]  our song of response.
[3505.10 --> 3505.78]  for ourACT
[3505.78 --> 3506.78]  Amen.
[3535.78 --> 3537.78]  Amen.
[3565.78 --> 3567.78]  Amen.
[3595.78 --> 3597.78]  Amen.
[3625.78 --> 3627.78]  Amen.
[3655.78 --> 3657.78]  Amen.
[3685.78 --> 3686.78]  Amen.
[3686.78 --> 3687.78]  Amen.
[3687.78 --> 3689.78]  Amen.
[3715.78 --> 3717.78]  Amen.
[3717.78 --> 3718.42]  So, we have just come back from visiting.
[3718.42 --> 3723.42]  And so as the deacons pass the offering baskets, they are going to give us a little update about
[3723.42 --> 3724.42]  their time.
[3724.42 --> 3727.42]  So let's have me, I ask the deacons to come forward.
[3727.42 --> 3729.46]  And then also Marion and Dawn to come and share.
[3739.46 --> 3742.46] 요.
[3742.46 --> 3743.54]  Good morning.
[3743.54 --> 3747.58]  I learned about two Greek words while we were there.
[3748.44 --> 3757.42]  So we would just like to share just a few, a very brief introduction to the place where Hannah works,
[3757.54 --> 3762.00]  having been there for the month of November, and we do thank you so much for your prayers while we were gone.
[3763.40 --> 3770.12]  We start with our first slide, and this is the lovely little village of Panayuta,
[3770.12 --> 3773.92]  just a 20-minute walk from the refugee camp one way,
[3774.28 --> 3777.60]  and about the same distance to Hannah's house in the other direction.
[3778.30 --> 3781.92]  We stayed here in Panayuta, a perfect location for us.
[3783.50 --> 3791.28]  Our next slide is one where we are with Steve and Chris Van Zannen,
[3791.48 --> 3795.82]  who were staying a few days with Hannah and Peter to hear how things were going for Hannah.
[3795.82 --> 3801.20]  Steve is the director of Resonate Global in Europe, and the Van Zannins live in Liberia.
[3801.80 --> 3805.52]  We had a lovely visit and meal at Hannah's house on the day we arrived.
[3806.14 --> 3811.26]  This photo is taken on the once-monthly Bible study and prayer time
[3811.26 --> 3815.94]  with all the three Christian volunteer organizations that work in the camp.
[3815.94 --> 3825.76]  Actually, the Van Zannins live in Lithuania, but it sounds a lot like Liberia.
[3827.20 --> 3828.56]  So, the next slide...
[3828.56 --> 3829.02]  I did Liberia?
[3829.08 --> 3829.88]  You did, yes.
[3830.22 --> 3834.10]  The next slide is actually an overview of the camp where we worked,
[3834.52 --> 3839.78]  and this is overlooking in the foreground, if you can see it on the projector screen behind me,
[3839.78 --> 3845.70]  is some metal roofs, and that's where the Euro Relief offices were.
[3846.20 --> 3853.20]  So, we would have to walk not only to camp, but also from security to this part of the camp.
[3853.36 --> 3859.86]  The camp was very spread out, and the picture is showing basically three types of housing
[3859.86 --> 3861.66]  that the refugees stayed in.
[3861.66 --> 3866.62]  And they all started in an insulated army tent, basically.
[3867.38 --> 3873.16]  And there could be two or three families, or eight or ten single people in each tent.
[3873.96 --> 3878.12]  And after a while, they would graduate, I guess, to the next level,
[3878.26 --> 3882.50]  which was more of a construction trailer, a little more insulated, a little more secure,
[3882.94 --> 3884.46]  but still two or three families.
[3885.14 --> 3888.62]  And if you were a single male, and there was a lot of them in camp,
[3888.62 --> 3891.84]  you never got past the insulated tent.
[3891.98 --> 3893.04]  You stayed in the tents.
[3893.80 --> 3896.78]  And then the large tents were called rub halls,
[3897.50 --> 3899.76]  and that was basically just for overflow.
[3900.46 --> 3903.32]  When we began our work at the beginning of November,
[3903.48 --> 3905.98]  we had about 1,200 refugees in camp.
[3906.60 --> 3910.08]  By the time we left a month later, there was about 4,000 refugees.
[3910.84 --> 3916.80]  So, the rub halls were starting to fill up with residents as well.
[3916.80 --> 3918.34]  Not an ideal.
[3918.54 --> 3922.30]  The other ones weren't ideal either, but better than the rub halls.
[3924.88 --> 3926.26]  Let's go to the next slide.
[3927.94 --> 3932.00]  This is me working with a few other volunteers in the warehouse.
[3932.98 --> 3937.26]  So, off-site from the camp, about six, seven, eight kilometers away,
[3937.70 --> 3939.78]  was a warehouse that they rented.
[3940.18 --> 3942.96]  This is where all the donations of clothing and shoes came in.
[3942.96 --> 3947.06]  And every couple of weeks, there was a number of trucks coming from the Netherlands.
[3947.42 --> 3951.14]  That's where most of the clothing donations came from.
[3952.00 --> 3954.88]  And people donated everything and anything.
[3955.04 --> 3960.96]  So, they had to be sorted as to gender, size, appropriateness,
[3962.10 --> 3964.96]  because people would donate all kinds of clothing,
[3965.10 --> 3966.78]  but we couldn't hand them out all the time.
[3966.78 --> 3973.20]  So, this was a lot of work, sorting the clothes and then putting them in banana boxes.
[3973.64 --> 3975.86]  They had tens of thousands of banana boxes,
[3976.34 --> 3979.52]  all with labels on them as to what was in the box.
[3980.08 --> 3983.04]  And those boxes would then end up back at camp,
[3983.12 --> 3986.12]  where we distributed them to new arrivals.
[3986.12 --> 3993.12]  Everybody that came, the first thing they got was a package of clothing.
[3993.78 --> 3998.82]  So, we would get some time, on a busy day,
[3998.88 --> 4001.22]  it would be two or three hundred new arrivals every day.
[4001.68 --> 4005.18]  So, they would have to get the clothing package.
[4006.26 --> 4007.36]  Next slide, please.
[4007.36 --> 4013.02]  This is the men's community centre.
[4013.18 --> 4016.50]  There was a women's community centre and a men's community centre.
[4016.92 --> 4021.54]  Just a place for men and then women separately to relax,
[4022.12 --> 4024.10]  have some Wi-Fi, play some games.
[4024.62 --> 4028.68]  It was a raucous, noisy place, the men's centre.
[4028.78 --> 4030.36]  Anyway, I spent a number of days there.
[4030.90 --> 4035.52]  We had ping pong, foosball, soccer on the video screen.
[4035.52 --> 4037.24]  We had a couple of days there, always going.
[4037.58 --> 4040.44]  And these men were very competitive.
[4040.98 --> 4045.66]  We also had a couple of barbers working there and a couple of tailors.
[4046.30 --> 4047.56]  So, haircuts were free.
[4048.28 --> 4053.38]  And the clothing that we gave, we always sized pants according to the waist size,
[4053.46 --> 4055.34]  but had no regard for length.
[4056.08 --> 4062.86]  So, a lot of the work that the tailors did was adjusting the pat legs for these guys.
[4062.86 --> 4069.36]  And the tailors and the barbers, as well as other interpreters we had around the camp,
[4069.76 --> 4071.04]  were resident volunteers.
[4071.24 --> 4074.56]  So, they were refugees that had agreed to do some work.
[4075.00 --> 4078.76]  And we would give them the food, or get the food for them,
[4078.88 --> 4080.38]  instead of them standing in line.
[4081.12 --> 4084.86]  And they'd be slipped a little bit of extra food, too, for their efforts.
[4085.86 --> 4087.98]  So, they were a valuable asset.
[4087.98 --> 4090.22]  Next slide, Laurie, please.
[4091.52 --> 4094.22]  This is just depicting some of the volunteers.
[4094.40 --> 4097.00]  We all had to wear red volunteer vests.
[4098.08 --> 4100.30]  And here we are distributing.
[4100.68 --> 4102.22]  I spent a lot of time doing this.
[4102.36 --> 4104.00]  The camp is very spread out.
[4104.48 --> 4111.40]  There was about 700 housing units, those tents and ISO boxes, those trailers.
[4111.40 --> 4119.84]  I think I went to every one of the 700 units distributing heaters, water, food, clothing tickets.
[4119.96 --> 4122.48]  After 10 or 12 days, they would get extra clothing.
[4123.18 --> 4126.66]  We had hygiene tickets or hygiene products, as well.
[4127.16 --> 4130.62]  So, that was a big part of the work there, as well.
[4130.62 --> 4141.78]  On the next slide, this is me teaching the ABCs in Hannah's program.
[4141.92 --> 4147.76]  And the ABC level is the people that have very little or no English.
[4147.96 --> 4152.10]  So, it's teaching the phonics, what the letter sounds like,
[4152.62 --> 4158.54]  and eventually learning to read and speak very simple words.
[4158.54 --> 4162.76]  And then comes also learning to know what you're saying.
[4163.68 --> 4168.24]  So, since things in the camp are so fluid,
[4168.38 --> 4173.34]  one never knew how many people would show up for a given class and at what levels.
[4173.48 --> 4178.02]  So, often it would be halfway through the ABC program on day two or three
[4178.02 --> 4183.16]  when another student or many would come in for the very beginning.
[4183.16 --> 4188.58]  So, the instructor needs to be very flexible and come up with ways to accommodate everyone.
[4189.28 --> 4189.80]  Next slide.
[4191.46 --> 4199.86]  And here, of course, is my mentor and the woman I've come to know and admire more and more over our visit in Greece.
[4200.44 --> 4205.54]  Hannah is so passionate about what she does and knows how to engage people where they're at.
[4206.10 --> 4209.36]  People want to come back to her classroom because she makes the learning fun
[4209.36 --> 4212.74]  and imparts both knowledge and wisdom to her students.
[4213.62 --> 4219.68]  In supporting her work, we are providing her salary and the resources she needs.
[4220.24 --> 4223.14]  Workbooks, notebooks, pens, pencils, and sundry items.
[4224.10 --> 4226.74]  The work that she does is often exhausting.
[4227.96 --> 4234.94]  So, besides providing finances, our prayers for her and her family are a great gift and encouragement for her.
[4234.94 --> 4237.40]  And thank you for supporting her in those ways.
[4248.78 --> 4249.94]  Thank you, Don and Mary.
[4250.00 --> 4250.52]  That was great.
[4251.18 --> 4256.16]  Let's turn to the Lord now in prayer for our world, our community, some of our needs.
[4256.98 --> 4257.56]  Let's pray.
[4258.78 --> 4260.52]  Heavenly Father, Lord in heaven,
[4260.52 --> 4264.72]  This morning we worship you, Alpha and Omega.
[4265.04 --> 4267.58]  The beginning and the end, the first and the last.
[4268.54 --> 4270.84]  You are our God who hears our prayers.
[4272.08 --> 4275.44]  You are our Master who attends to our cries.
[4276.66 --> 4282.02]  And Lord, the Holy Spirit, you have given groans within us and so we call upon you now.
[4283.20 --> 4289.46]  Grant us more of your Spirit as we wait upon your second Advent, your second coming.
[4289.46 --> 4301.08]  Give us anticipation and hope for that day when you will bring your kingdom in tow to right all wrongs and to mend all that is broken.
[4301.32 --> 4308.28]  Lord, would you teach us to walk in these days now in our lives, not by sight, but by faith.
[4308.28 --> 4328.04]  And Lord, in a world that is so full of hurts and in the midst of the disappointments of our own lives, would you make us your people, a community, the church, who are characterized by a rugged and a resistant joy.
[4328.04 --> 4336.64]  We pray that you would show us how to live out that joy, the joy of our salvation, the joy of hope in you.
[4337.10 --> 4346.58]  Would you help us to live it out before our neighbors and before a world as an act of kingdom resistance and as an act of kingdom witness.
[4346.58 --> 4357.38]  And Lord, we pray that in all of our circumstances, would you cultivate in us a heart of thankfulness that does not take for granted your good gifts to us.
[4358.20 --> 4363.18]  Lord, we pray that you would keep us from becoming cynical and desensitized.
[4363.86 --> 4369.34]  Would you wake us up to beauty and wonder and goodness that is around us because this is your world.
[4369.34 --> 4380.04]  And by your Holy Spirit, Lord, would you fill us with joy at the mystery of life, the marvel of your creation and all that you are doing in the world.
[4380.84 --> 4384.98]  Lord, we pray that you would give us joy and delight in our relationship with you.
[4385.90 --> 4392.16]  That we would yearn to be near you and to grow in discipleship, just like branches connected to a vine.
[4392.16 --> 4405.70]  Lord, for those among us, for those we know who are experiencing dryness, spiritually the grayness of winter in their inner spiritual life, Lord, we pray for renewal.
[4407.14 --> 4411.94]  And Lord, we bring to you our needs and our concerns, Lord, because you are our loving Father.
[4413.00 --> 4418.14]  Lord, you call us to cast our cares and our burdens and our needs upon you.
[4418.14 --> 4428.54]  And so we pray for our world and we lift up to you this morning all educators who are involved in the critical work of forming and shaping the minds and hearts of children.
[4429.36 --> 4435.24]  We ask that in this busy season leading up to Christmas, that you would refresh their hearts and minds.
[4435.98 --> 4443.86]  Grant them much patience and perseverance, wisdom and joy in the work they are doing.
[4444.32 --> 4447.84]  And we ask that you would use those who know you to be a light in your kingdom.
[4448.86 --> 4450.18]  We pray, Lord, for students.
[4450.36 --> 4451.98]  Would you give them peace in their hearts?
[4453.20 --> 4458.36]  May they look to you for their worth and identity as they seek to honor you in their studying.
[4459.56 --> 4461.22]  Lord, we lift up our church to you.
[4461.42 --> 4469.36]  We thank you for all of those in this church, Ladner CRC, who serve in so many different ways.
[4469.36 --> 4472.64]  Lord, doing the work of the ministry here at Ladner CRC.
[4472.74 --> 4473.70]  Lord, we need each other.
[4473.70 --> 4478.00]  We pray for Hannah Vander Camp.
[4478.54 --> 4487.70]  Lord, would you pour out your blessing on her in this Advent season and make the light of the gospel shine brightly in and through her.
[4487.70 --> 4498.56]  Lord, we thank you for bringing her to the place of your choosing that you would use her life in a way that would further the work of your kingdom.
[4499.92 --> 4503.00]  Lord, we pray for Terry, who had surgery on his arm.
[4503.22 --> 4504.54]  We pray for healing for him.
[4504.54 --> 4508.92]  Lord, we pray for patience as he waits for that healing to occur.
[4510.18 --> 4511.80]  Lord, we also grieve.
[4511.92 --> 4519.80]  We grieve, Lord, for Jana Kulin and her family at the recent death of Jana's sister, Erin.
[4519.80 --> 4519.90]  Lord, we pray for Aaron.
[4521.24 --> 4526.18]  Lord, we pray for your comfort for all those who grieve.
[4526.40 --> 4531.62]  Lord, we pray for Aaron's now son, who has lost his mother.
[4532.58 --> 4539.34]  And Lord, we pray, Lord, for the healing presence of the Holy Spirit, the good God who holds us.
[4539.52 --> 4541.52]  Lord, to make himself known.
[4541.60 --> 4548.14]  Would you make yourself known, Lord, to all those in the family and friends.
[4548.14 --> 4552.48]  And Lord, we ask all of this in the precious name of Jesus.
[4553.02 --> 4556.90]  We pray together as he taught us to pray, saying,
[4557.58 --> 4560.88]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4561.40 --> 4566.16]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4566.96 --> 4574.60]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4574.60 --> 4579.28]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4579.78 --> 4584.96]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4585.40 --> 4585.80]  Amen.
[4586.80 --> 4587.68]  Let's stand.
[4588.60 --> 4595.16]  And I want to invite you to join us for time of coffee and fellowship, right, in the fellowship hall through the doors there.
[4595.16 --> 4598.62]  And we go out with God's blessing upon us.
[4599.02 --> 4604.82]  So I invite you to hold out your hands just as a gesture of another hand posture for today.
[4605.18 --> 4606.14]  A gesture of receiving.
[4607.74 --> 4612.48]  The ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing.
[4613.30 --> 4615.52]  Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads.
[4616.00 --> 4617.80]  They shall obtain gladness and joy.
[4618.56 --> 4621.50]  And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
[4622.10 --> 4622.50]  Amen.
[4622.50 --> 4622.60]  Amen.
[4622.60 --> 4622.62]  Amen.
[4625.16 --> 4641.20]  Provely richly, enjoy and praising,
[4641.32 --> 4645.92]  Lord your Father, Spirit, Son.
[4646.50 --> 4650.98]  Never fall of our voices praising
[4650.98 --> 4656.02]  To it do not be in line
[4656.02 --> 4661.16]  Come and worship, come and worship
[4661.16 --> 4666.60]  O worship Christ of the Lord on me
[4680.98 --> 4710.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4710.98 --> 4740.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4740.98 --> 4770.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4770.98 --> 4800.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4800.98 --> 4830.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4830.98 --> 4860.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4860.98 --> 4890.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4890.98 --> 4920.96]  O worship, come and worship
[4920.98 --> 4950.96]  Thank you.
[4950.98 --> 4980.96]  Thank you.
[4980.98 --> 5010.96]  Thank you.
[5010.98 --> 5026.98]  pół.
[5026.98 --> 5031.32]  It's pretty loud in here, check, check if I turn this up a little bit more.
[5031.32 --> 5032.48]  Check, check, check.
[5032.48 --> 5035.48]  This is maxed out now, so it's still...
[5056.98 --> 5066.22]  Check, check, check, check.
[5066.22 --> 5067.22]  One, two.
[5067.22 --> 5070.42]  Check, check, check, check.
[5070.42 --> 5074.04]  Check, check, check, check, check, check.
[5074.04 --> 5076.08]  Hello Testing.
[5076.08 --> 5082.52]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, one, two, three, four.
[5082.52 --> 5085.40]  Oh.
[5085.40 --> 5088.52]  Is that a gingerbread reindeer?
[5088.52 --> 5089.96]  No.
[5089.96 --> 5091.76]  It's popsicle sticks.
[5093.76 --> 5094.64]  Check, check, check.
[5097.64 --> 5099.44]  Testing one, two, check, check, check.
