• The season of Epiphany and the concept of Jesus revealing his identity to us
• Jesus reveals himself through various means, including teaching, miracles, and sharing meals
• A table for sinners: Jesus eating with a sinful woman who repents, offering forgiveness
• A table for the many: Jesus hosting a meal for 5,000 people, revealing himself as the bread of life
• A table for the religious: Jesus eating with Pharisees, criticizing their neglect of justice and love of God
• The distinction between following Jesus and having a "religious life"
• The Bible's negative view of religion as a way to say "I don't need you" to God
• Following Jesus is better than a religious life because it involves trusting in him for salvation and living by his teachings
• Jesus rarely gets angry with people and is often compassionate and welcoming to those who come to him.
• He has a special anger towards religious leaders, particularly the Pharisees, due to their hypocrisy and external focus on religious practices.
• Jesus uses sharp language to rebuke the Pharisees for their emphasis on outward appearances rather than genuine faith and relationship with God.
• The three woes Jesus gives to the Pharisees aim to jar them awake from their complacent and hypocritical lifestyle.
• Jesus refuses to wash his hands before eating, scandalizing the Pharisees
• The incident is about ritualistic cleanliness, not hygiene or sanitation
• The Pharisees use hand washing as a symbol of being clean and separate from sin
• Jesus responds with a prophetic rebuke, pointing out their inner corruption despite outward appearances of cleanliness
• He uses the metaphor of a dirty dish to illustrate that true purity is about what's inside, not just on the surface
• Religion is external, not dealing with the darkness of hearts and private lives
• A religious life can be petty, focusing on minor details rather than big picture
• The Pharisees in Matthew 23:23 are criticized for tithing but neglecting justice and love of God
• Jesus wants us to care about God's word but not add extra rules beyond what is commanded
• A religious life can be conceited, focused on outward appearance rather than inward change
• Two views of God discussed: one that is conceited and focused on the outside, and another that leads to a life of humility
• Criticism of Pharisees for loving status and importance in the synagogue and marketplace
• Story of Jonah used as an example of how people can become conceited when they think they are good enough for God's love
• Contrast between Jonah's attitude (resenting God's forgiveness) and the Ninevites' response to the prophetic rebuke (repentance)
• Jesus' third woe to the Pharisees: a religious life is like an unmarked grave, leading people to unknowingly stumble over it and become ceremonially unclean
• Jesus criticizes Pharisees for being unclean because they lead people astray through their association with them
• The rebuke applies to all who lead others away from God, regardless of intention
• A person's way of life is what truly matters in their relationship with God and others
• Jesus' point is that a religious life focused on external rules can be deadly and lead people away from God
• The interaction began because Jesus didn't follow the ritualistic washing tradition, which offended the Pharisees
• Jesus says the Pharisees are actually unclean due to their focus on external rituals rather than love for God and others
• Jesus' teaching about Jonah and the purpose of prophetic rebuke
• The contrast between Jesus' heart and the heart of religious people, with a focus on repentance and forgiveness
• Jesus as the true Jonah, bringing rebuke to the world for the purpose of eliciting repentance
