[1114.48 --> 1115.48]  Amen.
[1116.48 --> 1117.48]  What's up?
[1117.48 --> 1118.48]  Yeah.
[1118.48 --> 1119.48]  You're reading Scripture, right?
[1119.48 --> 1120.48]  Yeah.
[1120.48 --> 1121.48]  Yeah.
[1121.48 --> 1124.48]  We'll work it out.
[1124.48 --> 1133.48]  Speaking of not knowing what's happening, I changed the Scripture reading as well.
[1133.48 --> 1135.48]  It's Romans, I think.
[1135.48 --> 1136.48]  I didn't write it down.
[1136.48 --> 1138.48]  Can you flip through the screen?
[1138.48 --> 1139.48]  Yeah.
[1139.48 --> 1140.88]  Yeah, okay, Romans 12.
[1142.54 --> 1148.44]  So if you have your Bible in front of you, please turn to Romans 12, or you can follow along on the screen.
[1158.44 --> 1165.02]  All right, so Romans chapter 12, and we will read verses 9 through 21.
[1165.02 --> 1169.96]  And I'll read it for us.
[1195.02 --> 1225.02] 
[1225.02 --> 1228.12]  Do not repay anyone evil for evil.
[1229.28 --> 1232.04]  Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.
[1232.38 --> 1236.72]  If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
[1237.46 --> 1241.52]  Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath.
[1242.26 --> 1247.72]  For it is written, it is mine to avenge, I will repay, says the Lord.
[1248.36 --> 1251.04]  On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[1251.56 --> 1253.72]  If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
[1253.72 --> 1256.98]  In doing this, he will heap burning coals on his head.
[1257.70 --> 1262.04]  Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[1262.64 --> 1264.22]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1264.82 --> 1266.00]  Thanks be to God.
[1266.84 --> 1271.32]  Okay, so let's stand and we'll sing our next song, The Lord's Prayer.
[1271.50 --> 1272.00]  It's yours.
[1272.20 --> 1272.56]  Let's stand.
[1272.56 --> 1290.64]  For the Lord's Prayer
[1290.64 --> 1292.64]  Oh
[1320.64 --> 1322.64]  Oh
[1350.64 --> 1352.64]  Oh
[1380.64 --> 1382.64]  Oh
[1410.64 --> 1412.64]  Oh
[1440.64 --> 1442.64]  Oh
[1470.64 --> 1472.64]  Oh
[1472.64 --> 1474.64]  Oh
[1474.64 --> 1476.64]  Oh
[1476.64 --> 1478.64]  Oh
[1478.64 --> 1480.64]  Oh
[1480.64 --> 1482.64]  Oh
[1482.64 --> 1484.64]  Oh
[1486.64 --> 1488.64]  Oh
[1488.64 --> 1490.64]  Oh
[1490.64 --> 1492.64]  Oh
[1492.64 --> 1494.64]  Oh
[1494.64 --> 1496.64]  Oh
[1500.64 --> 1515.64]  So having worshiped the Lord and seen his glory and his beauty we come before him at a time of confession and St. Augustine who said that what sin does in us is it kind of bends us in on ourselves.
[1515.64 --> 1536.64]  You know God created us to walk you know you can say maybe upright in with God and with one another in love of him and love of others but what sin does is it kind of twists us in on ourselves so that we really seek our own glory our own comfort our own benefit.
[1536.64 --> 1551.64]  And so confession is kind of like going to a physiotherapist in a sense it kind of straightens us out it reorients us it brings life and healing back into us and this is one of the reasons that we confess our sin to God.
[1551.64 --> 1557.64]  And so our call to confession today is based on Daniel chapter 9 verses 4 to 5.
[1557.64 --> 1563.64]  And so let us join together with Daniel in confessing our sins so let's read this together.
[1563.64 --> 1573.64]  Oh Lord the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments.
[1573.64 --> 1575.64]  We have sinned and done wrong.
[1575.64 --> 1576.64]  We have sinned and done wrong.
[1576.64 --> 1579.64]  We have been wicked and have rebelled.
[1579.64 --> 1583.64]  We have turned away from your commands and laws.
[1583.64 --> 1592.64]  So taking that call to confession let's just take a moment each one of us for personal silent confession.
[1592.64 --> 1621.64]  Oh Father we come to you as your sons and daughters.
[1621.64 --> 1636.64]  And Lord seeking you again seeking your face and your forgiveness which you offer us so freely inviting us to come to you to be healed to be reconciled with you and so that we can also be reconciled to others.
[1636.64 --> 1641.64]  And Lord though we have sinned and done wrong.
[1641.64 --> 1651.64]  Lord you took the punishment of our sin upon yourself on the cross so that through faith in our Lord Jesus we might be redeemed.
[1651.64 --> 1655.64]  And so Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy to us again this morning.
[1655.64 --> 1661.64]  And we pray that you would help us to walk uprightly by following you loving you and loving others.
[1661.64 --> 1662.64]  We pray in Jesus name.
[1662.64 --> 1663.64]  Amen.
[1663.64 --> 1670.64]  So brothers and sisters the gospel assures us of God's pardon in his forgiveness in his grace.
[1670.64 --> 1675.64]  So hear these words from Titus chapter 3 verses 4 to 7.
[1675.64 --> 1705.64] 
[1705.64 --> 1708.64]  And we pray that you would help us to make the hope of eternal life.
[1708.64 --> 1709.64]  Amen.
[1709.64 --> 1712.64]  So let's stand one more time to sing this song of response.
[1712.64 --> 1719.64]  So let's stand one more time to sing this song of response.
[1719.64 --> 1721.64]  Amen.
[1721.64 --> 1722.60]  Amen.
[1722.60 --> 1722.64]  Amen.
[1727.64 --> 1734.68]  Amen.
[1738.64 --> 1746.60]  Amen.
[1746.64 --> 1747.64]  Amen.
[1747.64 --> 1748.64]  Amen.
[1748.64 --> 1749.64]  Amen.
[1749.64 --> 1763.64]  on jesus
[1779.64 --> 1793.64]  is
[1809.64 --> 1823.64]  oh
[1823.64 --> 1842.60]  so at this time the children and teachers are to are dismissed to go to their classes
[1842.60 --> 1859.24]  so over the last couple months for the summer we have been in a sermon series called summer in
[1859.24 --> 1867.88]  the psalms just looking at various psalms that we find and so today our psalm will be psalm 37.
[1867.88 --> 1873.80]  so psalm 37 today next week we'll do one more psalm and then the plan is that we're going to jump into
[1873.80 --> 1880.68]  the book of romans after that for the fall so let's first today though turn to psalm 37.
[1882.76 --> 1890.44]  and it's uh 40 verses we're just going to focus on the first 11 so we'll read verses 1 through 11.
[1890.44 --> 1894.20]  that is on page 416 in your pew bible
[1896.84 --> 1900.52]  416 and we're reading psalm 37
[1905.00 --> 1906.44]  and the first 11 verses
[1909.16 --> 1916.92]  do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong for like the grass they will soon
[1916.92 --> 1926.04]  wither like green plants they will soon die away trust in the lord and do good dwell in the land and
[1926.04 --> 1933.32]  enjoy safe pasture delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart commit
[1933.32 --> 1940.28]  your way to the lord trust in him and he will do this he will make your righteous righteousness shine
[1940.28 --> 1947.96]  like the dawn the justice of your cause like the noonday sun be still before the lord and wait
[1947.96 --> 1953.88]  patiently for him do not fret when men succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes
[1954.76 --> 1962.52]  refrain from anger and turn from wrath do not fret it leads only to evil for evil men will be cut off
[1962.52 --> 1970.36]  but those who hope in the lord will inherit the land a little while and the wicked will be no more
[1970.36 --> 1976.92]  though you look for them they will not be found but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace
[1977.64 --> 1983.72]  the wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them oh i'm sorry this is the word of
[1983.72 --> 1991.32]  the lord thanks be to god to verse 11 like i said i just got carried away it's a great psalm many of the
[1991.32 --> 2000.68]  same themes do repeat so let's go to the lord in prayer as we open his word together oh lord we ask that
[2000.68 --> 2010.20]  this morning as we open your word would you illuminate our eyes our hearts our minds that you'd give us eyes
[2010.20 --> 2016.52]  to see you hearts to believe in you and that you would encourage us by your holy spirit and we pray
[2016.52 --> 2026.92]  for christ's name and for his sake amen um you know i've shared this you'll you'll keep hearing me say
[2026.92 --> 2032.20]  this but i talk about taiwan sometimes where my family and i lived for nine years and so while when we
[2032.20 --> 2039.08]  were living in taiwan after church on sundays you know it's so hot during the summer that what we would
[2039.08 --> 2045.48]  do is with friends after church we'd go and get frozen yogurt and it was just a walk right down the
[2045.48 --> 2054.68]  street and in front of this frozen yogurt shop i saw this sign that this poster i want to share with
[2054.68 --> 2063.80]  you in the window here's what it said keep calm and eat frozen yogurt that's something i can get behind
[2063.80 --> 2071.08]  right on a hot day it's it's just so nice have you seen something like this before right keep calm and
[2071.88 --> 2078.28]  do stuff right and it's you know it's a it was pretty big trend several years ago it's been remixed
[2078.28 --> 2084.20]  in lots of ways and you can keep calm and do all kinds of things but i was curious where this came
[2084.20 --> 2092.28]  from and so i searched online and i learned that the phrase originated as a slogan in 1939.
[2092.28 --> 2100.68]  it was the spring before world war ii and the british government was kind of anticipating the dark
[2100.68 --> 2108.92]  days ahead and so they designed this slogan in this poster to encourage its citizens as you know they
[2108.92 --> 2119.96]  were entering the war and so here is the original poster keep calm and carry on so around two and a half
[2119.96 --> 2127.64]  million copies were printed but none of them were ever put on display so what happened was
[2128.60 --> 2134.12]  somewhere in the government some official decided he wasn't sure if you know he had last minute doubts
[2134.12 --> 2140.44]  about this phrase and so in the end they scrapped it they were all destroyed so now fast forward six
[2140.44 --> 2147.88]  decades to the year 2000. a bookseller is looking through this box of books that he that he bought
[2147.88 --> 2155.56]  and kind of in the bottom folded up was a copy of this poster and so he got it out and he hung it on
[2155.56 --> 2162.12]  the wall in his bookshop kind of right up over the cash register and so customers are coming in and they
[2162.12 --> 2169.48]  started to ask where can i get a copy they really liked it so the bookshop owner started to print it and
[2169.48 --> 2179.96]  sell it in his bookshop and the keep calm craze began and so when i was reading about this one british
[2179.96 --> 2188.68]  author he talked about how this phrase keep calm and carry on is very quintessentially british now i
[2189.72 --> 2194.04]  and so this author this is what he wrote and i wish i could say in a british accent
[2194.04 --> 2201.80]  but i'll do my best oh i'm not going to try to imitate it this is what he wrote we may be suffering
[2201.80 --> 2208.20]  something of an invasion at the moment but that's no reason to start acting in a hot-headed manner
[2209.40 --> 2216.44]  rather than cause a scene we shall just go about our daily business as if nothing has happened just
[2216.44 --> 2225.64]  keep calm and carry on and the reason i share that is because this is very similar to the message that
[2225.64 --> 2235.72]  we have here in psalm 37 so take a look with me at verse 1. do not fret because of those who are evil
[2235.72 --> 2244.76]  or be envious of those who do wrong so the main idea in psalm 37 is do not fret
[2244.76 --> 2252.68]  it's repeated that command is repeated three times in the verses that we read verses 1 through 11 and
[2252.68 --> 2257.88]  as you know in the bible when something is repeated like that it's because god wants us to pay attention
[2257.88 --> 2265.40]  and take notice and it means this phrase do not fret it means don't start acting in a hot-headed manner
[2266.20 --> 2270.44]  right that's literally what the hebrew word means don't get heated up
[2270.44 --> 2281.88]  and what are we to keep calm and not fret about it says do not fret because of those who are evil or be
[2281.88 --> 2289.32]  envious of those who do wrong in other words don't let what people are doing in the world that you see
[2289.32 --> 2297.72]  around you that is wrong that is bad that is unjust wreck your day don't let it throw you off track don't get
[2297.72 --> 2305.96]  worked up about it now we need to know that psalm 37 is actually written by david and if you know
[2305.96 --> 2315.00]  anything about david's life he was fretting pretty often wasn't he right he had a lot to fret about
[2315.56 --> 2320.36]  now i'll just make this comment like we don't use this word fret very often do now do we so it feels a
[2320.36 --> 2327.16]  little funny to say it but again fret it just means to have this deep anxiety this deep worry and
[2327.16 --> 2334.12]  this anger even that kindles inside of us when we see things happening around us that
[2335.40 --> 2341.96]  are wrong or or are bad and unjust you know and that's what david saw so much in his life
[2343.08 --> 2347.40]  but it's interesting that david is writing this towards the end of his life
[2347.40 --> 2354.36]  in verse 25 we didn't read it but if you look further down in verse 25 he says i was a young man
[2354.92 --> 2363.96]  and now i am old so david is writing here as an older man and he's offering some pastoral and i would
[2363.96 --> 2373.16]  maybe even say grandfatherly wisdom based on his life experience and you may recall that at times in
[2373.16 --> 2381.88]  his own life david suffered greatly at the hands of wicked scheming men so just for one example think
[2381.88 --> 2391.64]  of david's experience with king saul right i mean remember david was king saul's loyal servant and king
[2391.64 --> 2398.60]  saul though he fell out of favor with god and he knew that david was god's next anointed king and he was so
[2398.60 --> 2405.40]  angry and jealous at david that he ended up plotting david's murder trying to kill him over and over
[2405.40 --> 2412.68]  again and it got so bad that david for a period of several years actually had to hide out in the
[2412.68 --> 2420.04]  wilderness right he had to hide in caves he had to sleep in the woods he even had to take refuge with
[2420.04 --> 2429.16]  the enemies of his people okay this was it was really bad saul was plotting scheming evil against him
[2430.44 --> 2436.60]  but what happened in the end david learned to entrust himself to the justice of god
[2437.40 --> 2444.44]  right to the point where on two occasions david had the opportunity to end this game of cat and mouse
[2444.44 --> 2452.76]  by taking matters into his own hand and killing saul one time if you remember david's men come upon
[2452.76 --> 2458.36]  saul who's in the cave looking for david and they could have killed him he was in the cave
[2459.00 --> 2464.84]  saul didn't know that david was there and his men were all with him but david wouldn't allow it he said
[2465.24 --> 2472.28]  not put my hand against the lord's anointed and then there was another time when david sneaks into
[2472.28 --> 2480.68]  the camp it was saul's camp and nobody's keeping watch they're all sleeping and david and his men are
[2480.68 --> 2489.40]  standing right over saul and david's buddy abner is like just let me take the spear and kill him it'll
[2489.40 --> 2497.72]  be over david it'll be done we can stop running you will be safe but david had learned to entrust
[2497.72 --> 2505.64]  himself to the justice of god and not to take matters into his own hands so what happens at the
[2505.64 --> 2513.96]  end of the story well ultimately god judges saul he vindicates david and he gives david the throne
[2513.96 --> 2521.88]  just like he promised and so david you know that's just one episode in his life but david has seen
[2521.88 --> 2529.48]  plenty of evil doers come and go and now from the vantage point of his older age looking back over
[2529.48 --> 2537.48]  his life and his experience he's saying you know i have fretted a lot in my life all along the way
[2537.48 --> 2543.40]  with all these things that i've been through and what i've learned is not to worry about the evil doer
[2543.40 --> 2553.96]  but instead to entrust myself to god's care and so now here in psalm 37 david tells us several ways
[2554.92 --> 2562.76]  for us to do that two ways for us to keep calm and trust god and so in the rest of our time this
[2562.76 --> 2571.24]  morning i want to look at five antidotes or five alternatives to fretting to being heated up and
[2571.24 --> 2576.60]  worried and anxious and so we're just going to look at each one of these briefly so what is the
[2576.60 --> 2586.52]  first one the first one we see is to trust okay to trust and we see that in verse three trust in the lord
[2586.52 --> 2596.60]  and do good dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture and so we see this first alternative to fretting
[2596.60 --> 2606.36]  and that is to trust in the lord in other words to have faith the british pastor charles spurgeon he
[2606.36 --> 2618.92]  put it very simply faith cures fretting okay very simple faith cures fretting faith in the promises of
[2618.92 --> 2624.44]  god faith to understand that the circumstances that we see around us are not all that there is
[2624.44 --> 2633.56]  and that god has other plans that we don't and that we can't see is um the way that we can not
[2634.12 --> 2639.40]  be worried about the evil that we see around us and so we need to just trust god we need to have faith
[2639.40 --> 2648.44]  in him but then i love how it says in verse three trust the lord and do good and that means that even
[2648.44 --> 2654.68]  while we are trusting that god is sovereign that he will take care of the evil doer in the wicked
[2655.72 --> 2660.84]  we also get to work doing good so trust is not just this passive thing we're like well i'm just
[2660.84 --> 2667.96]  going to trust god but he says trust in the lord and do good be active right paul says we read it earlier
[2667.96 --> 2676.60]  paul says in romans 12 do not become overcome with evil but do what overcome evil with good
[2676.60 --> 2684.36]  so instead of fretting about what the wicked are doing god wants us to put our trust into action
[2684.36 --> 2690.12]  by serving him by loving him by loving our brothers and sisters and god's family by loving our neighbors
[2690.68 --> 2698.92]  being salt and light in the world so trust god and do good okay now the second alternative that we see to
[2698.92 --> 2707.08]  fretting is to delight and this is you know maybe one of the most popular verses or the most well-known
[2707.08 --> 2715.56]  verses that we see in this psalm verse 4 says take delight in the lord and he will give you the desires
[2715.56 --> 2724.92]  of your heart now does that mean that i can ask god for that bentley that i've had my eye on and that he
[2724.92 --> 2732.04]  is just going to give it to me right does that work did that work for you or that beautiful house on the
[2732.04 --> 2738.92]  lake right or any other thing in life that can give us kind of temporal pleasure that and that we might
[2738.92 --> 2745.08]  enjoy well you know it's not true if you have been a christian for any length of time so if that's not
[2745.08 --> 2753.32]  what it means what is david saying here he's saying that if we take delight in the lord he's going to
[2753.32 --> 2762.60]  give us what we delight in and what is that the lord right in other words if we are delighting in god
[2762.60 --> 2769.32]  and we're longing for god if that's what we desire god is going to give us the greatest thing that he can
[2769.32 --> 2775.80]  give us which is more of himself right the greatest thing that we need this morning is more of god
[2775.80 --> 2783.48]  and you may think this morning that you need lots of things but the most important thing that you need
[2783.48 --> 2791.00]  is more of the person of god in your life right to know him better to lean on his promises more fully
[2791.80 --> 2798.84]  and to know him and to delight in him and friends this is an alternative to fretting because when god is at
[2798.84 --> 2806.12]  the center of our hearts our hearts are set on him are fulfilled in him and we know that we have him
[2807.08 --> 2813.08]  we're not going to be as worried about all these things that those who do not know god and desire god
[2813.08 --> 2821.80]  are chasing after so we don't need to worry so instead of fretting we can trust in god and do good
[2822.44 --> 2829.08]  we can delight in the lord and he will give us the desire of our heart he will give us himself
[2829.08 --> 2837.32]  so we have what we desire and then the third thing that we see here is to be still to be still
[2837.32 --> 2845.00]  and we see that in verse 7. be still before the lord wait patiently for him do not fret when people
[2845.00 --> 2853.48]  succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes so god is saying here don't worry don't
[2853.48 --> 2866.12]  get worked up don't get hot headed about the wicked but be still before the lord rest are you restless
[2866.12 --> 2875.32]  are you restless in the christian life right god invites you to rest in him you know so often when
[2876.04 --> 2884.36]  i find myself fretting or worried or anxious it's because it's over things that i can't control
[2886.52 --> 2892.12]  but when we rest in the lord we're expressing that confidence that we have in him that nothing
[2892.12 --> 2899.40]  is outside of his control nothing catches him by surprise right different things can assault us
[2899.40 --> 2904.04]  we don't know what's coming around the corner this coming week what email we're going to get what phone
[2904.04 --> 2909.88]  call we're going to get what's going to happen we don't know what may come and turn our lives upside
[2909.88 --> 2917.32]  down but god has a firm grip on all of the affairs of your life he has a firm grip on all the affairs of
[2917.32 --> 2926.04]  the world and nothing will catch him by surprise and so we need to just rest instead of fretting
[2927.00 --> 2933.88]  quietly waiting on the lord quieting our hearts our minds before him quieting our spirit so we have
[2933.88 --> 2940.20]  that restfulness about us that has a great confidence in the promises of god and who he is
[2940.20 --> 2947.96]  so we can trust and we can do good we can delight in the lord we can rest before him we can be still
[2949.40 --> 2957.56]  but then david says there's something that we need to guard against we actually he says need to refrain
[2958.28 --> 2967.80]  from anger so look here verse 8 it says refrain from anger and turn from wrath do not fret it leads only
[2967.80 --> 2979.96]  to evil so david is saying listen if you don't keep calm and refrain from anger refrain from getting
[2979.96 --> 2986.68]  this kindling this burning anger in your heart what's going to happen is you're going to be in danger of
[2986.68 --> 2995.16]  being an evildoer right if when we see wickedness around us and we respond to that with the anger that is
[2995.16 --> 3001.96]  destructive or vengeful you know like david would want to do to maybe just kill saul he's coming
[3001.96 --> 3008.92]  after him i'm just going to kill him makes sense but he's saying if you do that you are no different
[3009.96 --> 3017.72]  than the evildoer so david says because he knows and he says this because he knows that there is a very
[3017.72 --> 3021.08]  real possibility that this is something that we're going to struggle with
[3021.08 --> 3028.84]  and so one of the things we have to realize is that in this psalm and in throughout the whole bible
[3029.88 --> 3040.36]  even those who are called righteous those who trust in god they can fall into doing evil and that means
[3040.36 --> 3048.44]  you and i if we trust the lord and so you'll notice that those who are called righteous are not called
[3049.24 --> 3058.28]  perfect people right righteous a righteous person does not equal a perfect person so further on in
[3058.28 --> 3067.24]  psalm 37 here in verses 23 and 24 this is what he says the lord makes firm the steps of the one who
[3067.24 --> 3075.40]  delights in him right the righteous though he may stumble he will not fall for the lord upholds him with
[3075.40 --> 3085.24]  his hand so do you hear that the man or woman who delights in the lord stumbles sometimes that's what
[3085.24 --> 3096.20]  he's acknowledging right they fail we fail we don't live up to our name righteous right we we aren't what we
[3096.20 --> 3104.68]  should be but guess what it says that we won't be utterly cast down because the lord upholds us with his hand
[3106.20 --> 3113.24]  and you know the righteous person doesn't stand because he takes up god's cause he stands because
[3113.24 --> 3123.96]  god takes up his cause and friends that is the good news because when we compare the very best that we
[3123.96 --> 3132.12]  can do with the perfect justice and righteousness of god guess what we all fall into the wicked category
[3132.12 --> 3141.24]  and that is a problem for us right the bible says all have sinned we all like sheep have gone astray
[3142.12 --> 3147.80]  and that's talking about us apart from the righteousness that god provides through faith
[3147.80 --> 3154.36]  in jesus christ our lord and so that means there's only one way that you can be counted by god in the
[3154.36 --> 3163.08]  category of the righteous and it's not by doing deeds in your own effort it's by trusting in jesus and
[3163.08 --> 3170.20]  trusting in jesus alone to deliver you from sin and from guilt and from the justice of god and friends
[3170.20 --> 3180.12]  that's how you get access to righteousness so who is the righteous person in the bible the righteous man
[3180.12 --> 3188.68]  or the righteous woman is a man or woman who stands justified by god's grace alone and when
[3188.68 --> 3199.56]  apart from the grace of god when we realize that apart from the grace of god that we would be in the
[3199.56 --> 3205.24]  category of the wicked that enables us not to get so burned up when we see evildoers around us
[3205.80 --> 3213.32]  because apart from the grace of god that would be us because the mercy and the grace of god in our lives
[3213.32 --> 3218.20]  helps us to put our hope in him and it helps us to do all of these things that david's talking about
[3218.84 --> 3225.72]  to trust in god to do good to delight in him to rest on him these are all things that only he can enable
[3225.72 --> 3233.88]  us to do okay so that brings us then to the final alternative to fretting that we see here and that is to
[3233.88 --> 3242.52]  hope in god to put our hope in god so let's take a look at verse 9 there for those who are evil will be
[3242.52 --> 3247.72]  destroyed but those who hope in the lord will inherit the land
[3250.20 --> 3260.44]  you know when we look at the world around us it can sure seem like the wicked have their way it sure
[3260.44 --> 3271.56]  seems that way but god says their day is coming now i see that some of you have glasses on
[3272.52 --> 3280.28]  like i do so i feel better because i'm not the only one some of you have glasses now when i was in
[3280.28 --> 3287.48]  my early 30s i had to get glasses for the first time and i realized that because i was sitting in
[3287.48 --> 3292.36]  the back of the church and i was looking at the screen you know we were singing songs i'm like i
[3292.36 --> 3299.32]  can't really read that so if you also can't see well you may come up front that's one solution but i
[3299.32 --> 3307.48]  ended up getting glasses as well and you know i can see close up just fine but it's those far away things
[3308.12 --> 3314.76]  that are kind of blurry that i can't make out clearly and often we have the same problems spiritually
[3314.76 --> 3324.12]  right we see our circumstances that are close to us clearly we worry about them we can't see that far
[3324.12 --> 3332.36]  down the road you know we're not able to see those things that god sees and so what we need is to have
[3332.36 --> 3338.68]  god's eyeglasses on we need to get glasses that are god's glasses and we need to have the vision that
[3338.68 --> 3345.72]  the scriptures give us that tell us the promises of god and sometimes we struggle with our faith in
[3345.72 --> 3354.36]  this way because we can't see what god has in in plan you know we only see the circumstances that we
[3354.36 --> 3361.00]  experience in the moment we don't see what is far off but god sees the big picture right we have a
[3361.00 --> 3370.36]  snapshot in time we see so very little don't we but god sees all of time all at once unfolding before
[3370.36 --> 3377.40]  him and god tells us that those who cause evil in this world it looks like they're flourishing now
[3377.40 --> 3384.84]  but he says they are temporary and we saw that in several places in this passage so look again with me
[3384.84 --> 3393.08]  verse 2 for instance for like the grass they will soon wither like green plants they will soon die away
[3394.04 --> 3402.36]  verse 10 a little while in the wicked will be no more though you look for them they will not be found
[3403.88 --> 3411.00]  and since we have poor eyesight we have to believe this by faith right our circumstances and what we see
[3411.00 --> 3416.20]  we see is that the evil around us is that the evil around us has been going on and unfolding for a long
[3416.20 --> 3424.44]  time but god tells us that their day will come to an end and in verse 11 in contrast to the wicked
[3424.44 --> 3431.64]  who have no future verse 11 says but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity
[3432.60 --> 3438.44]  you know i think we've all heard that term meek used as kind of with a negative connotation right
[3439.16 --> 3445.72]  as a synonym for maybe cowardice or weakness but friends that is not the biblical meaning of meekness
[3446.28 --> 3455.64]  you know when we think of course of moses who was the most meek man of all time and moses was no pushover
[3455.64 --> 3464.52]  right moses was a leader among men he was a warrior and he was a lawgiver meekness is not weakness but
[3464.52 --> 3472.76]  rather it describes those who humbly look to god and put their hope in him so meek means to be humble
[3473.40 --> 3481.16]  to trust in god and not ourselves even as we do good and of course jesus quotes this verse in the
[3481.16 --> 3490.68]  beatitudes doesn't he right he says the meek shall inherit the earth the earth do you notice that change
[3490.68 --> 3499.72]  there jesus promises not just the land to the meek but the entire earth the meek those who hope in the
[3499.72 --> 3506.36]  lord live in light of that future promise that one day god will make all things new one day his kingdom
[3506.36 --> 3511.24]  come will come on earth as it is in heaven and one day evil will be no more
[3511.24 --> 3522.20]  and because of that what can we do keep calm and trust god say it with me keep calm and trust god
[3522.76 --> 3531.00]  let's pray oh god we do ask that you would help us and you know i stand here preaching things that i so
[3531.00 --> 3539.56]  often remind myself that i know so little of and so lord would you help all of us to not fret to not
[3539.56 --> 3552.12]  be hot headed when we see evil doers but lord help us to trust in you and do good help us to delight in
[3552.12 --> 3562.68]  you more than anything else this world has to offer lord help us to be still to refrain from evil but to
[3562.68 --> 3570.60]  hope in you and to see that you will do justice in the end and your kingdom will come in all of its
[3570.60 --> 3577.56]  fullness and so lord we know that in you is great reward that in seeking you is great reward not only
[3577.56 --> 3588.04]  in time but also for all eternity in christ's name we pray amen all right so let's um let's all stand as
[3588.04 --> 3602.04]  as the worship team comes up and they'll lead us in our song of response
[3602.04 --> 3606.36]  for 1
[3606.36 --> 3624.76]  We will fill the matter, we will fill the night, we will walk the valley with your light,
[3624.76 --> 3633.88]  We will walk the través of the path, we will fill the colormos, the source will go away,
[3633.88 --> 3647.88]  and
[3663.88 --> 3673.88]  The feeling that I stumble, the feeling that I fall, the feeling that I turn that's in love to.
[3673.88 --> 3683.88]  You are not abandoned, you are not forsaken, you will cheer me on in the matter that you may.
[3683.88 --> 3693.88]  The feeling that I'm trying to offer the source of God's love and the strong life of me.
[3693.88 --> 3703.88]  Praise the Lord's love, the Lord's name, you can stand in peace and say, for God is full of me.
[3703.88 --> 3733.86]  The feeling that I'm trying to offer the source of God's love, the Lord's love, the Lord's love, the Lord's love, the Lord's love, the Lord's love, the Lord's love.
[3733.86 --> 3738.66]  Mmm.
[3742.52 --> 3745.08]  Mmm.
[3746.36 --> 3747.46]  mmm.
[3749.88 --> 3751.46]  Ah.
[3755.98 --> 3758.56]  Um.
[3758.56 --> 3760.06]  Oh.
[3760.06 --> 3764.70]  Thanks, O Lord, stop, no more is greater.
[3765.10 --> 3769.46]  Who can stand against us, if our God is full of us?
[3769.68 --> 3774.16]  Sing with joy now, O God is for us.
[3774.46 --> 3778.34]  The Father's love is strong and mighty for us.
[3778.66 --> 3782.74]  Thanks, O Lord, stop, no more is greater.
[3782.74 --> 3787.74]  Who can stand against us, if our God is full of us?
[3790.06 --> 3815.34]  One way we respond to God's word is through not only responding in praise again to him,
[3815.34 --> 3818.96]  but in giving of our tithes and offerings for the work of his kingdom.
[3818.96 --> 3824.84]  And so our designated offering for today is Resonate Global Mission.
[3824.98 --> 3832.56]  This is the mission agency of the Christian Reformed Church, both here in North America and around the world.
[3832.74 --> 3835.04]  They send missionaries around the world.
[3835.16 --> 3840.04]  They do campus ministry, planting churches, and many other things.
[3840.76 --> 3846.82]  And so let us respond as the Lord has been gracious to us.
[3846.82 --> 3849.86]  And may I invite the deacons to collect the morning offering.
[3849.86 --> 3852.18]  change themiro game.
[3852.18 --> 3856.38]  It's a everydayattend form.
[3856.46 --> 3856.50]  That'll be true.
[3856.50 --> 3857.52]  Praise God.

[3936.90 --> 3938.90]  Amen.
[3966.90 --> 3969.40]  Let's go to the Lord in prayer together.
[3970.40 --> 3976.44]  Praying is a prayer of supplication for the needs and concerns of our own church and for his kingdom around the world.
[3976.74 --> 3980.08]  And we will conclude by saying together the Lord's prayer.
[3980.50 --> 3981.74]  And the words will be on the screen.
[3982.30 --> 3983.56]  So please join me in prayer.
[3987.54 --> 3992.46]  Father, we thank you that you are in charge.
[3993.04 --> 3995.82]  You are the sovereign Lord over all the earth.
[3996.90 --> 4008.66]  Lord, when we see the evil prosper, when we see the wicked trample the poor and helpless, when we see greed and corruption flourish, it's so easy to despair.
[4009.66 --> 4012.48]  But you, O Lord, know the end from the beginning.
[4013.62 --> 4018.50]  You, the judge of all the earth, will bring all things to right.
[4019.64 --> 4024.86]  Compared with your sovereign might, O Lord, you're creating and sustaining power.
[4024.86 --> 4034.92]  And compared to that, all the schemes of the wicked, all their raging, their warring, their violence is like so much useless noise in your ear.
[4035.98 --> 4039.28]  Because no wrong will escape the day of your judgment.
[4039.28 --> 4048.26]  We thank you, O God, that you have exalted Jesus to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name.
[4048.72 --> 4051.94]  That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow.
[4052.44 --> 4054.74]  In heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[4055.24 --> 4059.30]  And every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[4059.30 --> 4068.34]  And Lord, while we wait for that great day, give us eyes to see the work you are doing in our lives and around the world.
[4069.30 --> 4074.04]  Remind us that you are sovereign over all things and give us joy and peace in that knowledge.
[4075.18 --> 4083.06]  And Lord, give us the boldness also to participate in your work and to do good, to dwell in the land faithfully.
[4083.06 --> 4090.98]  Empower us with your spirit, O Lord, so that everything we do confesses you as Lord.
[4092.58 --> 4097.86]  And Lord, if it was not for your grace and mercy, we too, Lord, would be evildoers.
[4098.52 --> 4100.50]  And Lord, sometimes yet we still fall.
[4101.86 --> 4104.56]  But we thank you for your love for us that we've experienced.
[4104.76 --> 4106.58]  And we pray for those who do not know you.
[4107.26 --> 4111.14]  And not know what you've done for them through your death and your resurrection.
[4111.14 --> 4119.90]  Lord, may your spirit be working in their hearts to bring them to repentance of sin and faith in the Lord Jesus.
[4120.84 --> 4124.66]  Lord, give them a longing for the bread of life that only you can provide.
[4125.68 --> 4131.38]  And Lord, as we think of those who don't know you, Lord, each one of us has people on our hearts.
[4132.16 --> 4133.36]  Lord, that we pray for.
[4133.48 --> 4137.50]  And so right now, in the quietness of our own hearts, Lord, we lift them up to you in prayer.
[4137.50 --> 4143.34]  Asking, Lord, that you would shower the knowledge of your son upon them in their hearts.
[4154.86 --> 4157.20]  Lord, we also pray for those in our congregation.
[4157.78 --> 4163.88]  Lord, we praise you and we give you so much thanks for Ted, who is 99 years old.
[4163.88 --> 4169.28]  And also for little ones who you bring into the world.
[4169.64 --> 4172.90]  Lord, even Nancy's grandson.
[4174.24 --> 4178.18]  And Lord, whether we're young or old, Lord, you have a plan for each one of our lives.
[4178.30 --> 4181.14]  The number of days, Lord, are in your hands.
[4182.02 --> 4185.74]  And so, Lord, we celebrate the young and the old together.
[4186.52 --> 4189.64]  We pray also, Lord, for those in our congregation who are hurting.
[4189.64 --> 4203.82]  Lord, we lift up to you Ellie and Carl, George, Grace, Jerry, Shirley, Eileen, Diane, Hank and Liz.
[4205.40 --> 4214.20]  Ted, Lord, who continues, Lord, to be in good health but always still needs your hand upon him.
[4214.20 --> 4220.18]  And Tani as well and, Lord, for others, for Kukuye as well.
[4220.88 --> 4222.74]  Lord, others who need your care.
[4222.84 --> 4223.82]  We pray for their healing.
[4224.48 --> 4228.12]  We ask that you would reveal to them your power and your love.
[4228.86 --> 4234.78]  And, Lord, we ask all of these things in the wonderful name of Jesus as we pray as you taught us.
[4235.20 --> 4235.70]  Sing together.
[4235.70 --> 4236.70]  Amen.
[4236.70 --> 4240.24]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4240.64 --> 4244.98]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4245.64 --> 4247.88]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[4248.36 --> 4253.62]  And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4254.12 --> 4257.80]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4258.38 --> 4263.28]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4263.96 --> 4264.30]  Amen.
[4264.30 --> 4264.40]  Amen.
[4265.70 --> 4267.78]  So now we receive the Lord's blessing.
[4268.42 --> 4271.12]  So please rise in body or in spirit.
[4273.64 --> 4275.12]  And God sends us out.
[4275.58 --> 4283.90]  Not only does he first call us to worship him, but he sends us out with his blessing upon us that we might be his people to follow him.
[4284.80 --> 4287.92]  And so let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.
[4287.92 --> 4297.10]  And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[4297.10 --> 4300.28]  So let's remain standing.
[4300.28 --> 4301.28]  We'll sing our final song.
[4301.28 --> 4301.52]  We'll sing our final song.
[4301.52 --> 4305.84]  And then do join us for time of fellowship right through the doors in our fellowship hall.
[4305.84 --> 4306.22]  But let's pray.
[4306.22 --> 4307.42]  Amen.
[4307.46 --> 4309.52]  Yeah.
[4310.68 --> 4311.66]  Amen.
[4317.70 --> 4319.58]  Amen.
[4319.64 --> 4321.94]  Amen.
[4321.94 --> 4331.26]  Lord and God, the King of kings, we are Lord and God, the Lamb.
[4331.26 --> 4342.26]  We are Lord and God, the Lord, the Lord is the great I Am.
[4342.26 --> 4352.26]  Over all our place in majesty, we will bow before His throne.
[4353.68 --> 4363.26]  We will worship Him in righteousness, we will worship Him alone.
[4363.26 --> 4374.36]  We are Lord and God, the Lord is Lord of all who live.
[4375.12 --> 4385.18]  We are Lord and God, the universe, all that to Him we give.
[4385.18 --> 4396.14]  Hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the Lord.
[4396.14 --> 4407.52]  Hallelujah to the Lord, Lord of all, who is the great I Am.
[4407.52 --> 4421.88]  Hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings.
[4421.88 --> 4429.92]  Hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to to the King of kings.
[4429.92 --> 4436.12]  Hallelujah to the King of kings, hallelujah to the King of kings.
