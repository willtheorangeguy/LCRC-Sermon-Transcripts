[0.00 → 6.34] They may come to work from a quest athlete's age.
[6.34 → 12.64] They may come to work with a strong public discourse.
[12.64 → 19.14] I must be concerned with some changes that way.
[19.14 → 27.34] Geoffrey would ants to work with their views including its related humanity.
[27.34 → 29.34] Amen.
[57.34 → 59.34] Amen.
[87.34 → 89.34] Amen.
[117.34 → 119.34] Amen.
[147.34 → 149.34] Amen.
[177.34 → 179.34] Amen.
[207.34 → 209.34] Amen.
[237.34 → 239.34] Amen.
[267.34 → 288.66] Good morning.
[288.66 → 289.66] Good morning.
[289.66 → 290.66] Good morning.
[290.66 → 291.66] And Happy New Year.
[291.66 → 293.66] Happy New Year.
[293.66 → 297.10] So I actually learned, and this may be interesting to you,
[297.10 → 301.10] it was interesting to me, but I learned that today is not only the New Year,
[301.10 → 306.94] but it is the Feast of the Circumcision of Jesus.
[306.94 → 309.10] The eighth day after the birth of Christ,
[309.10 → 312.30] this is part of the Continental Reform tradition.
[312.30 → 317.10] It is in the Church Order of the Canons of Dort in the Helvetic Confession.
[317.66 → 319.42] This goes back a way, though.
[319.42 → 321.66] I'm not sure if it's so much a thing today.
[321.66 → 324.38] But what it does tell us is that Jesus came,
[324.38 → 330.22] he was born as a Jew, born under the law, to redeem us from the curse of the law.
[331.02 → 334.38] And so we are here this morning, not only in the new year,
[334.38 → 343.34] to start off the year worshipping God, acknowledging him in our lives, seeking him in our lives,
[343.34 → 353.66] but also to remember that we're here to worship Jesus, who on Christmas came and was born among us to rescue us from sin and death.
[355.50 → 359.82] So this morning we're going to have a bit more of a casual worship service.
[359.82 → 363.26] And there will be some singing of hymns.
[363.26 → 365.66] We're going to, there won't be anything on the screen.
[366.62 → 370.06] So we will be using our Bibles, our hymnals.
[370.78 → 377.50] And so that will be, I'll encourage you to find these resources in a pew near you.
[378.06 → 384.70] So let's begin this morning first with a scripture reading from Psalm 61.
[384.70 → 388.70] So I invite you to turn to Psalm 61.
[414.70 → 416.70] So let's go to Psalm 61.
[429.18 → 430.70] It's actually not the one I wanted.
[431.26 → 432.22] Could you hold on a second?
[432.22 → 442.70] Remember this is casual.
[444.70 → 454.70] Psalm 65.
[463.66 → 463.98] Yeah.
[463.98 → 464.30] Okay.
[464.30 → 465.90] Let's, let's look at Psalm 65.
[467.34 → 468.38] That's the one I wanted to do.
[469.74 → 469.98] Okay.
[469.98 → 471.02] Psalm 65.
[471.02 → 471.90] I'm sorry.
[471.90 → 474.30] And we will read it responsively.
[474.30 → 474.62] Okay.
[474.62 → 479.90] So I'll just begin with the first verse, and then you will all read together on the even verses.
[481.50 → 481.90] All right.
[482.46 → 483.18] So let's begin.
[484.30 → 486.54] Praise awaits you, O God in Zion.
[487.10 → 489.26] To you, our vows will be fulfilled.
[489.26 → 500.30] When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
[500.30 → 505.66] Bless us, our vows will be truth and bring the air to the living and the world.
[505.66 → 512.62] We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
[512.62 → 522.14] You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness, O God, our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
[522.14 → 528.86] Who are in the mountains of the earth and of the earth and of the earth and of the earth and of the earth and of the earth.
[528.86 → 534.22] Who still the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
[534.22 → 538.38] Those living on our way, fear your wonders.
[538.38 → 544.78] Where the mighty ones and the need and the days, you all for the songs of joy.
[544.78 → 547.74] You care for the land and water it.
[547.74 → 549.42] You enrich it abundantly.
[549.42 → 556.94] The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
[556.94 → 570.94] You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
[570.94 → 577.82] For our hands of the desert are full and full, the hills are full and full.
[577.82 → 582.46] The meadows are covered with flocks, and the valleys are mantled with grain.
[582.46 → 584.94] They shout for joy and sing.
[586.30 → 587.82] Thanks be to God.
[587.82 → 588.38] Let's pray.
[592.46 → 597.82] Our gracious God and heavenly Father, we come before you this morning praising you because
[597.82 → 600.70] you, Lord, hear prayer.
[601.90 → 605.82] To you, all people, men, women, and children will come.
[605.82 → 610.30] Because when we, Lord, were overwhelmed by our sins, you forgave us.
[611.26 → 613.42] Lord, you have blessed your people.
[613.42 → 615.18] You have filled us with good things.
[616.22 → 621.42] And Lord, you answer our need with the righteousness of Jesus.
[621.42 → 623.74] You sent him to come into our world.
[623.74 → 626.30] You are the God of our salvation.
[626.30 → 629.18] You are the hopes of the ends of the earth.
[629.18 → 631.02] So we praise you, Lord.
[631.02 → 632.78] And we praise you for your creation.
[633.82 → 638.54] Lord, you have set the moon, the stars, the planets, and their orbits.
[639.26 → 642.22] Lord, you cause the grass to grow.
[642.86 → 645.58] Lord, you take care of the animals.
[645.58 → 647.90] And Lord, you make all things joyful and abundant.
[648.70 → 650.14] Lord, we praise you this morning.
[650.14 → 654.46] You are the God of 2023.
[654.46 → 656.22] And you are the God of 2024.
[656.22 → 659.26] You are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[659.98 → 667.90] And Lord, we thank you for calling us and gathering us this morning to remember that you are our God, and we are your people.
[667.90 → 669.74] We pray in Jesus' name.
[669.74 → 670.46] Amen.
[673.74 → 683.66] Okay, so please turn in your great hymnals to hymn number 568, Love Divine, All Loves Excelling.

[875.14 → 878.14] Okay, let's turn to number eight.
[878.14 → 886.14] I remember my first, my very first day here at this church was New Year's Day, 2020.
[886.14 → 891.14] And I remember Hertz Decries up here, and he would lead the singing from the mic and everything.
[891.14 → 893.14] I don't know if I can do that.
[893.14 → 894.14] I can't, actually.
[894.14 → 899.14] Maybe I can.
[899.14 → 901.14] This is.

[925.14 → 926.14] One, five, and six.
[926.14 → 927.14] All that God desired to reign.
[927.14 → 928.14] In a letter to bring his one.
[928.14 → 929.14] The Lord, the Lord, the Lord is firm.
[929.14 → 943.14] is
[959.14 → 973.14] is
[989.14 → 999.14] oh

[1052.48 → 1053.88] 170.
[1055.04 → 1057.34] Please turn to hymn 170.
[1060.46 → 1062.88] We'll have to see which verses we want to sing as well.
[1064.12 → 1064.52] Oh, okay.
[1064.78 → 1065.60] I'm not there yet.

[1135.12 → 1141.84] Lord, earth's name, for earth we see His name.
[1141.84 → 1152.34] Whatever the skin you are called, you and His tears will sing.
[1153.08 → 1162.94] A thousand angels in your sight are like anything wrong.
[1162.94 → 1172.94] Short as the cross shall rise to life before the rising sun.
[1174.30 → 1183.24] For the earth we ever hold in shame, so there's a small array.
[1183.24 → 1194.22] May my Lord on earth shrink as the dream, thy heavenly holy day.
[1195.48 → 1204.40] Come on, наша young man, as best are all for Jesus now.
[1204.40 → 1219.18] All right, you may be seated.
[1220.10 → 1232.22] And at this time, I'm going to ask John Windermere to come and give us the report of council as a year-end review of some of the things that has happened, how God has been at work amongst us.
[1234.40 → 1264.38] Thank you.
[1264.40 → 1266.40] Thank you.
[1266.40 → 1268.40] Thank you.
[1268.40 → 1270.40] Thank you.
[1270.40 → 1272.40] Thank you.
[1272.40 → 1302.40] 
[1302.40 → 1304.40] Thank you.
[1304.40 → 1306.40] Thank you.
[1306.40 → 1308.40] Thank you.
[1308.40 → 1309.40] Thank you.

[1330.40 → 1331.40] Thank you.
[1331.40 → 1332.40] Thank you.
[1332.40 → 1334.40] Thank you.
[1334.40 → 1339.16] volunteer involved in all these ministries, none of these would happen without you.
[1340.16 → 1343.42] We were able to take part in three sessions of cross-training.
[1344.06 → 1349.30] The sessions were Walk of Faith, Testimonies from our Members, George Herbert, Poet of
[1349.30 → 1352.50] the Christian Life, and Christianity and Climate Change.
[1353.30 → 1359.00] At this past September's Congregational Meeting, we discussed the possibility of a name change
[1359.00 → 1359.70] for our church.
[1359.70 → 1365.06] This discussion will be continued at the first Congregational Meeting in 2024.
[1365.96 → 1368.06] We seek the Lord's guidance on this.
[1370.42 → 1375.60] During this past year, we have enjoyed times of fellowship, a soup and bun lunches after
[1375.60 → 1381.08] morning services, our fall barbecue, and the seniors' luncheon this past December.
[1381.94 → 1385.26] Thanks to our hospitality team for organizing these events.
[1385.26 → 1389.52] Paul Kemp continued as our part-time music director.
[1389.86 → 1392.76] Paul's gifts are certainly a blessing to our worship.
[1393.58 → 1398.00] For a second year, Paul put together a choir for our Christmas services.
[1399.30 → 1403.70] Our associate pastor, Nancy, continues to be a blessing with our Chinese ministry.
[1404.42 → 1409.72] We are happy that Pastor Nancy has slowly been recovering from her cancer surgery and is now
[1409.72 → 1411.68] able to resume all her duties.
[1412.40 → 1418.82] Her ministry consists of discipleship training with about 10 persons, online Bible and prayer
[1418.82 → 1420.18] meetings, and preaching.
[1420.96 → 1425.12] An average of 40 persons join in on the worship on Sunday mornings.
[1425.88 → 1427.82] Some guest pastors help with the preaching.
[1427.82 → 1434.66] Other activities are Bible study meetings after the morning service, Mandarin Kids Life class,
[1435.12 → 1441.32] Friday evening worship with choir and praise team, and a praise dance ministry before fellowship
[1441.32 → 1442.52] on Friday evenings.
[1443.68 → 1450.82] Once per month, our two worshipping groups, English and Mandarin, meet together on our family Sunday.
[1451.56 → 1456.08] We worship and celebrate the communion together and then separate for our own sermons.
[1456.08 → 1460.52] In the background, many groups and committees function faithfully.
[1461.18 → 1468.08] Worship committee, hospitality, maintenance, counting, library, safe church, and our deacons
[1468.08 → 1469.10] and pastoral teams.
[1469.88 → 1474.36] Also, our audiovisual team and many vocalists faithfully serve.
[1475.30 → 1481.32] A special thank you to Mel Mass, our treasurer, for keeping our finances and records in such good
[1481.32 → 1482.16] order.
[1482.16 → 1487.68] One of the highlights of the year was the many baptisms we were able to witness.
[1488.40 → 1497.26] Children baptized were Geneva and Jacqueline Essay, Panel, Janelle, and Aubrey Elberton,
[1498.30 → 1499.92] Noah and Nathan McCrae.
[1499.92 → 1511.22] Adults baptized this year were Elizabeth Gao, Jackie TSE, and Tiffany GUA, Scott Pan, Sam Shia,
[1512.34 → 1520.92] Joy Zhang, Jilin Zhao, Jenny Zhou, Joey Zhu, Stephanie and Michael Jiang.
[1520.92 → 1523.82] I studied real hard for those parts.
[1523.82 → 1530.92] Also welcomed as members were Julie Beattie, Colin and Angela McKenzie, Kenny McCrae, Emmanuel
[1530.92 → 1542.92] and Aside Baron, Benz Barbadian, Valid Basis Drafter, Mustafa Barbadian, and Fawn Ku sari.
[1542.92 → 1548.64] Kevin and Jenna Kulun and family left us and have moved to Prince George.
[1549.16 → 1555.72] Our congregation was saddened by the death of three longtime members, Joyce DeVos, Joan
[1555.72 → 1557.98] Canto, and Ali Hack lander.
[1557.98 → 1564.78] We take comfort from the psalmist, knowing that the Lord heals the brokenhearted and binds their wounds.
[1565.28 → 1570.34] We look forward to the return of Christ when God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[1571.04 → 1574.78] There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
[1575.32 → 1578.82] There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.
[1580.42 → 1584.22] We do not know what God has in store for us for 2024.
[1584.22 → 1590.74] We ask our Heavenly Father for his continued blessing and care as we grow in grace together.
[1591.58 → 1592.52] May we be faithful.
[1603.94 → 1604.86] Thank you, John.
[1605.38 → 1606.86] Well done with those names.
[1607.52 → 1608.06] It was very good.

[1747.02 → 1754.22] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.

[1791.76 → 1798.96] For in thy glory through mercies I see.
[1799.92 → 1806.96] All I have been with thy hand and through my name.
[1807.68 → 1814.96] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1814.96 → 1821.58] Let's have one more choice.
[1828.16 → 1829.40] The next one.
[1830.14 → 1831.12] My Jesus, I love thee.
[1831.80 → 1832.42] That sounds great.
[1832.86 → 1833.80] 557.
[1834.30 → 1834.94] 557.
[1835.48 → 1837.14] My Jesus, I love thee.
[1837.14 → 1839.08] All four verses?
[1839.80 → 1839.94] Or?
[1842.36 → 1842.84] Sure.
[1843.26 → 1843.74] Let's do it.
[1843.74 → 1844.74] Let's do it.
[1844.74 → 1851.94] Look in the interacted.
[1851.94 → 1853.12] Oh, Jesus.
[1853.34 → 1855.12] That sounds great.
[1865.12 → 1865.58] Of God.
[1865.58 → 1867.58] Amen.
[1895.58 → 1897.58] Amen.
[1925.58 → 1927.58] Amen.
[1955.58 → 1957.58] Amen.
[1985.58 → 1987.58] Amen.
[2015.58 → 2021.96] You may be seated.
[2035.64 → 2041.02] So as we turn the calendar to the start of a new year, let us open God's word together.
[2041.28 → 2045.34] Please turn with me in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 2.
[2045.58 → 2055.76] Matthew chapter 2, beginning in verse 1.
[2055.88 → 2060.74] So this is on page 717 in your pew Bible.
[2061.08 → 2062.16] Page 717.
[2064.10 → 2067.14] And we will read a very familiar passage.
[2067.48 → 2069.38] It's the story of the visit of the Magi.
[2072.38 → 2073.94] I'll give you a minute to turn there.
[2074.90 → 2075.94] Matthew chapter 1.
[2076.98 → 2077.98] Oh, sorry, chapter 2.
[2078.12 → 2078.92] Matthew chapter 2.
[2079.68 → 2083.90] And then we'll read verses 1 through 12.
[2083.90 → 2087.06] Please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[2087.06 → 2096.94] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked,
[2097.16 → 2101.00] Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[2101.00 → 2105.40] We saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.
[2105.40 → 2111.24] When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
[2112.06 → 2119.90] When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
[2119.90 → 2126.70] In Bethlehem in Judea, they replied, for this is what the prophet has written.
[2127.78 → 2133.28] But you, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are by no means least amongst the rulers of Judah.
[2133.28 → 2139.86] For out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.
[2141.38 → 2147.94] Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
[2148.88 → 2150.84] He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
[2150.84 → 2153.72] Go and make careful search for the child.
[2154.32 → 2159.78] As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.
[2160.68 → 2163.82] After they had heard the king, they went on their way.
[2164.38 → 2169.92] And the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them, until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[2171.26 → 2173.88] When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[2174.16 → 2178.60] On coming to the house, they saw the child and his mother Mary.
[2178.60 → 2181.06] And they bowed down and worshipped him.
[2181.78 → 2186.98] Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.
[2187.54 → 2190.46] And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod,
[2191.02 → 2194.58] they returned to their country by another route.
[2195.32 → 2196.56] This is the word of the Lord.
[2198.74 → 2204.06] And let's pray as we prepare to look at God's word together this morning.
[2204.16 → 2204.52] Let's pray.
[2205.52 → 2207.58] Our Father, we thank you again for your word.
[2207.58 → 2216.36] And Lord, we thank you for just the that you have called the nations to come and to seek you,
[2216.48 → 2219.02] to find you, and to worship you.
[2219.52 → 2224.38] And Lord, may we do so in this time that we have together this morning.
[2225.34 → 2228.02] Lord, open your word to us by the work of your Holy Spirit.
[2228.30 → 2232.74] We pray for his glory and for the good of your people.
[2233.08 → 2234.08] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2234.26 → 2234.46] Amen.
[2234.46 → 2234.56] Amen.
[2236.66 → 2241.68] And so, you know, over the course of the couple of Christmas days, you know, we sang the song many times already.
[2242.68 → 2243.88] Joy to the world.
[2244.40 → 2245.46] The Lord is come.
[2246.18 → 2247.14] And then what's the next line?
[2248.34 → 2251.20] Let earth receive her king.
[2251.66 → 2252.90] Let earth receive her king.
[2253.62 → 2255.38] And that's what this passage is all about.
[2255.38 → 2258.22] It's about the birth of a newborn king.
[2258.50 → 2260.02] The true king of the world.
[2260.16 → 2266.42] Not King Herod, not Caesar, not any of the other kings of the surrounding nations, but the true king has come.
[2266.42 → 2276.54] And then it also shows us the response of joy that he brings to all those who seek him and find him and worship him.
[2277.00 → 2283.76] Seeking and finding this true king, worshipping this true king brings great joy.
[2283.76 → 2294.62] And so the question I want to ask this morning, just briefly as we look at this passage, is really, it is the most vital question that we can ask as we go into the new year.
[2295.08 → 2297.88] It's the most vital question any of us could ever ask.
[2298.28 → 2301.80] And the question is, have you sought Jesus?
[2303.00 → 2304.58] And have you found him?
[2305.28 → 2306.88] Have you found the king?
[2306.88 → 2314.04] And then maybe, perhaps a more interesting question even than that, is how would you know?
[2315.60 → 2322.08] What would be the response of someone who has found Jesus as the king of his or her life?
[2322.24 → 2329.70] How could you tell by looking at someone's life that they have found the king, Jesus?
[2329.70 → 2340.26] Well, Matthew tells us about the visit of the Magi, and he does so and answers these questions that we just talked about.
[2340.56 → 2343.52] So I want to consider this passage this morning in two ways.
[2343.62 → 2345.76] First, let's see who seeks the king.
[2346.46 → 2349.22] And then secondly, what does it look like to worship the king?
[2350.20 → 2353.02] So the first question, who seeks the king?
[2353.56 → 2355.90] Look with me again at verse 1.
[2355.90 → 2365.54] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem.
[2366.52 → 2367.92] So who seeks the king?
[2369.86 → 2371.44] Magi from the east.
[2372.44 → 2373.58] Now, who are these people?
[2373.68 → 2375.04] Let's say a few things about them.
[2375.68 → 2378.02] The tradition is that there were how many?
[2379.36 → 2379.80] Three.
[2380.72 → 2384.20] But that is merely because there are three kinds of gifts.
[2384.20 → 2386.20] The Bible doesn't tell us how many there were.
[2387.14 → 2387.90] Maybe there are a bunch.
[2387.98 → 2388.38] We don't know.
[2389.84 → 2391.98] It says also they came from where?
[2393.12 → 2393.96] The east.
[2395.12 → 2395.84] Where is the east?
[2395.90 → 2398.32] It doesn't really say it's east of Jerusalem.
[2398.96 → 2401.24] Perhaps it was Persia or Babylon.
[2402.18 → 2405.78] And that means they came from a very long distance.
[2405.78 → 2411.26] It would have been a journey of maybe some 800 miles.
[2411.96 → 2414.70] And it would have taken many months.
[2415.76 → 2422.76] If they had come all the way from Persia, it means they would have gone up steep mountains and down deep valleys.
[2423.48 → 2423.66] Right?
[2423.70 → 2425.26] They would have crossed raging rivers.
[2425.46 → 2428.66] They would have ridden smelly, ordinary camels.
[2428.66 → 2439.08] They would have had to be aware of bandits and robbers who would have maybe targeted them specifically for the great wealth that they carried.
[2440.14 → 2443.94] They made their way across many foreign and strange lands.
[2444.50 → 2447.02] They left their home, their hearth.
[2447.58 → 2449.44] They came all that distance to do what?
[2450.26 → 2453.08] To seek a Jewish king.
[2453.08 → 2460.12] We also know they didn't come to the manger, despite our Christmas cards.
[2461.04 → 2463.14] It says in verse 11, they came to a house.
[2463.90 → 2468.76] Well, because the journey took so long, Jesus wasn't a newborn infant anymore.
[2469.48 → 2474.68] And we know from Herod's decree to kill all the children in Bethlehem under two years old,
[2475.38 → 2479.94] that he was probably somewhere in that age range, somewhere less than two years.
[2479.94 → 2483.28] So he was quite a young child, for sure.
[2484.22 → 2488.32] Also contrary to the popular Christmas song, they were not kings.
[2489.20 → 2493.94] The Greek word used here is magi, from which we get the word magician.
[2495.08 → 2497.16] They were astronomers.
[2498.20 → 2499.16] They were priests.
[2499.74 → 2502.60] They were advisors, likely to their own king.
[2502.90 → 2503.68] They were scholars.
[2503.96 → 2505.64] They would have been part of the royal court.
[2505.64 → 2512.52] In the ancient world, the knowledge of the laws of the movement of the stars and the planets was important.
[2513.80 → 2516.98] There wasn't this word scientist available,
[2517.24 → 2521.18] but from observing the natural world around them and above them,
[2521.26 → 2523.38] they knew how the world worked.
[2523.98 → 2526.40] And they were thought to know secrets.
[2527.20 → 2529.68] And this is why they were traditionally called the wise men.
[2529.68 → 2535.82] But what's so stunning about these magi is that they are Gentiles.
[2537.02 → 2538.06] It's stunning.
[2539.06 → 2540.70] Their appearance, imagine this.
[2540.78 → 2544.16] Imagine being in Bethlehem or Jerusalem 2,000 years ago.
[2544.52 → 2549.02] And imagine these three men coming onto the scene,
[2549.90 → 2551.58] speaking a mysterious language,
[2552.44 → 2554.22] dressed in unusual clothing,
[2555.08 → 2556.64] their skin being a different colour.
[2556.64 → 2560.16] However, these people would have been considered foreigners,
[2561.26 → 2564.42] pagans, dangerous unbelievers.
[2565.62 → 2567.98] They would have been thought of, as Paul says,
[2568.40 → 2570.86] of the Gentiles in the book of Ephesians,
[2571.08 → 2574.66] that they would have been excluded from citizenship in Israel,
[2575.12 → 2577.08] foreigners to the covenants of promise,
[2577.56 → 2580.22] without hope and without God in the world.
[2581.64 → 2584.08] And yet, who seeks the king?
[2584.08 → 2585.84] They do.
[2586.40 → 2587.74] They are here,
[2588.02 → 2590.30] right at the beginning of Jesus' life.
[2591.08 → 2593.44] The people who come from the other side of the earth
[2593.44 → 2596.08] to seek the king of the Jews
[2596.08 → 2598.02] are the Gentiles.
[2599.02 → 2600.76] How about the chief priests of the law,
[2600.86 → 2601.80] who are right there in Jerusalem?
[2602.04 → 2603.32] Did they go to seek the king?
[2604.22 → 2605.12] They did not,
[2605.72 → 2608.32] even though it was only five miles away to Bethlehem.
[2608.32 → 2611.30] So they have come to worship him.
[2612.34 → 2615.26] Him who is the saviour of all the nations.
[2616.32 → 2619.38] Jesus can be sought and found, friends, by all people.
[2620.10 → 2620.26] Right?
[2620.36 → 2621.24] Not just the Jews.
[2621.62 → 2623.22] He is the king of all people.
[2623.30 → 2624.88] He is the king of each one of us here.
[2625.76 → 2627.12] All of us can seek Jesus.
[2629.30 → 2631.16] And then the second thing I want us to consider
[2631.16 → 2632.82] is not only who seeks the king,
[2632.82 → 2635.68] but also how do we know that we have found him?
[2636.28 → 2637.82] What's the appropriate response
[2638.58 → 2642.74] when you find the king of all the nations?
[2643.60 → 2645.10] Well, so as we look at this passage,
[2645.28 → 2648.28] what do the magi do when they find Jesus?
[2648.96 → 2649.82] When the magi arrive,
[2650.46 → 2652.52] they find Jesus and they worship.
[2653.88 → 2655.54] And not just any kind of worship,
[2655.80 → 2660.66] but really full-on, complete, heartfelt worship.
[2660.66 → 2663.54] And so notice what it says in verse 10.
[2667.70 → 2669.04] When they saw the star,
[2669.56 → 2672.34] they were overjoyed.
[2673.62 → 2674.06] Overjoyed.
[2674.22 → 2675.08] That's even, okay,
[2675.14 → 2676.88] I read another translation that said this.
[2677.68 → 2678.64] When they saw the star,
[2678.82 → 2682.46] they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[2683.72 → 2685.48] That's a lot of joy, right?
[2686.22 → 2689.88] Rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[2689.88 → 2691.32] Okay, so it doesn't say
[2691.32 → 2694.44] they were moderately pleased to find Jesus.
[2695.52 → 2695.86] Right?
[2695.98 → 2696.20] No.
[2696.54 → 2698.12] They clapped their hands.
[2698.32 → 2699.70] I mean, it doesn't say that in the text,
[2699.78 → 2700.50] but let's imagine.
[2700.76 → 2701.82] What does it look like
[2701.82 → 2703.70] to rejoice exceedingly with great joy?
[2704.82 → 2705.80] That's a lot of joy.
[2706.02 → 2707.04] They clapped their hands.
[2707.12 → 2707.70] They shouted.
[2708.04 → 2709.66] They slapped each other on the backs.
[2709.92 → 2710.86] They danced.
[2711.62 → 2713.06] They laughed so hard,
[2713.36 → 2713.92] they cried.
[2716.38 → 2716.86] Overjoyed.
[2716.86 → 2719.18] That's the response
[2719.18 → 2720.22] when we meet the king.
[2721.06 → 2722.06] And then they went in,
[2722.36 → 2722.96] and it says,
[2723.12 → 2724.84] they bowed down.
[2725.96 → 2727.58] We don't do that much today, do we?
[2728.88 → 2729.78] But, you know,
[2729.86 → 2731.48] kind of using our bodies
[2731.48 → 2732.68] to express our worship,
[2733.42 → 2735.60] they bowed before him.
[2737.08 → 2738.60] How else do they worship him?
[2738.72 → 2740.46] Well, they offer Jesus gifts.
[2741.36 → 2742.98] The point of the gifts
[2742.98 → 2744.08] is really quite simple.
[2744.08 → 2746.60] They were expensive.
[2747.88 → 2749.32] Verse 11 says this.
[2751.40 → 2752.36] When coming to the house,
[2752.46 → 2753.36] they saw the child
[2753.36 → 2754.32] with his mother Mary.
[2755.08 → 2756.24] They bowed down
[2756.24 → 2757.10] and worshipped him.
[2757.24 → 2757.94] Then they opened
[2757.94 → 2759.42] their treasures
[2759.42 → 2761.06] and presented him
[2761.06 → 2762.38] with gifts of gold
[2762.38 → 2763.86] and of incense
[2763.86 → 2765.08] and of myrrh.
[2767.62 → 2768.68] Perhaps you know,
[2768.92 → 2769.80] does anybody know
[2769.80 → 2771.26] the Far Side cartoons
[2771.26 → 2772.08] by Gary Larson?
[2772.58 → 2773.48] Are you familiar with those?
[2774.40 → 2775.86] Larson has one cartoon
[2775.86 → 2776.90] about the wise men.
[2777.66 → 2778.48] I don't know if you've seen it,
[2778.52 → 2779.02] but it shows
[2779.02 → 2780.52] these three wise men
[2780.52 → 2781.22] standing in front
[2781.22 → 2782.46] of the nativity
[2782.46 → 2784.32] offering their gifts
[2784.32 → 2785.54] of gold and frankincense
[2785.54 → 2786.00] and myrrh.
[2786.46 → 2786.96] And then there is
[2786.96 → 2788.00] a fourth wise man
[2788.00 → 2789.50] who is looking
[2789.50 → 2790.46] very disappointed
[2790.46 → 2791.60] as he walks away.
[2792.88 → 2794.18] And then the caption
[2794.18 → 2795.26] to the cartoon
[2795.26 → 2796.36] is this.
[2797.30 → 2799.08] Unbeknownst to most theologians,
[2799.66 → 2801.44] there was a fourth wise man
[2801.44 → 2802.88] who was turned away
[2802.88 → 2803.72] by the angels
[2803.72 → 2805.56] for bringing a fruitcake.
[2807.18 → 2808.22] You see him carrying
[2808.22 → 2808.80] this fruitcake,
[2809.16 → 2809.86] walking away.
[2811.12 → 2812.22] He was bounced
[2812.22 → 2812.94] by the angel.
[2814.40 → 2815.52] When they worshipped
[2815.52 → 2816.32] Jesus as king,
[2816.40 → 2817.66] they didn't offer fruitcakes.
[2818.70 → 2820.04] They offered gifts
[2820.04 → 2821.28] fit for a king.
[2822.36 → 2824.32] These boxes of treasure
[2824.32 → 2826.06] would have been
[2826.06 → 2827.70] a significant fortune
[2827.70 → 2829.56] for this poor family.
[2831.26 → 2831.82] But not only
[2831.82 → 2832.76] did they bow down
[2832.76 → 2833.58] and worship him
[2833.58 → 2834.08] and not only
[2834.08 → 2834.74] did they bring him
[2834.74 → 2835.52] these costly gifts,
[2835.60 → 2836.88] they also obeyed him.
[2837.94 → 2838.26] Right?
[2838.32 → 2839.48] When their visit was over,
[2839.96 → 2841.20] an angel visited them
[2841.20 → 2841.76] in a dream
[2841.76 → 2842.60] and told them,
[2842.80 → 2843.70] don't go back to Herod.
[2844.68 → 2845.44] And even though
[2845.44 → 2846.12] it would have been
[2846.12 → 2846.92] a great risk
[2846.92 → 2847.92] to their own lives
[2847.92 → 2850.24] to disobey Herod,
[2850.32 → 2851.68] the king of Judah,
[2852.82 → 2854.18] they did so.
[2854.24 → 2855.30] They disobeyed Herod
[2855.30 → 2857.64] because God had said so.
[2858.58 → 2859.32] So they did it.
[2859.98 → 2860.72] God spoke.
[2861.52 → 2862.26] They obeyed.
[2863.50 → 2865.72] Because he is the king.
[2866.16 → 2867.52] He is the true king.
[2868.32 → 2870.40] That is the appropriate response.
[2871.24 → 2872.40] When the king speaks,
[2872.64 → 2873.80] we obey.
[2875.08 → 2876.42] So how then do you know
[2876.42 → 2877.64] that you've sought
[2877.64 → 2878.30] and then found
[2878.30 → 2879.10] the true king?
[2879.88 → 2881.34] He is your true king
[2881.34 → 2882.74] if you worship him with joy,
[2882.96 → 2884.92] if you offer the best
[2884.92 → 2885.82] and the greatest gifts
[2885.82 → 2886.68] that you have to offer.
[2887.40 → 2888.44] And he is your king
[2888.44 → 2889.40] if you obey him
[2889.40 → 2890.30] in your lives.
[2890.84 → 2891.26] And friends,
[2891.34 → 2892.40] we know that we can't
[2892.40 → 2893.54] do this in our own strength,
[2893.62 → 2893.88] can we?
[2895.14 → 2897.60] But when we have found him
[2897.60 → 2898.78] only by the grace of God
[2898.78 → 2899.72] leading us
[2899.72 → 2901.84] like God led those magi
[2901.84 → 2902.58] to him,
[2903.48 → 2905.12] he also gives us the grace
[2905.12 → 2906.48] to receive him
[2906.48 → 2907.22] and to worship him.
[2910.00 → 2911.26] And so why do we give
[2911.26 → 2912.34] this wholehearted response
[2912.34 → 2912.92] to the king?
[2912.92 → 2915.84] Because of what the king
[2915.84 → 2916.70] has done for us
[2916.70 → 2917.72] and who he is.
[2918.56 → 2919.84] And I want to also
[2919.84 → 2921.54] end here with this,
[2921.62 → 2922.50] the last stanza
[2922.50 → 2924.14] of the Christmas carol,
[2924.24 → 2924.88] Joy to the World.
[2925.02 → 2926.08] Please listen if you can.
[2927.24 → 2928.16] This is what it says.
[2929.40 → 2931.12] He rules the world
[2931.12 → 2932.36] with truth
[2932.36 → 2933.88] and grace
[2933.88 → 2936.06] and makes the nations
[2936.06 → 2936.88] prove
[2936.88 → 2938.42] the glories
[2938.42 → 2939.64] of his righteousness
[2939.64 → 2941.48] and wonders
[2941.48 → 2942.84] of his love
[2942.84 → 2944.40] and wonders
[2944.40 → 2946.08] of his love
[2946.08 → 2947.78] and wonders
[2947.78 → 2949.36] and wonders
[2949.36 → 2950.26] of his love.
[2951.28 → 2951.70] Right?
[2951.76 → 2952.46] We worship him
[2952.46 → 2953.64] because he is the king
[2953.64 → 2954.34] of righteousness
[2954.34 → 2956.42] who came to make us
[2956.42 → 2957.56] righteous in God's sight.
[2957.56 → 2959.20] And we worship him
[2959.20 → 2960.20] because he is the king
[2960.20 → 2960.80] of love
[2960.80 → 2961.98] who loved us so much
[2961.98 → 2963.90] that he gave his life
[2963.90 → 2964.74] for us
[2964.74 → 2966.52] so that we might know
[2966.52 → 2968.38] the love of our heavenly father.
[2969.18 → 2969.80] So friends,
[2969.90 → 2971.62] as we go into 2024,
[2972.20 → 2974.06] may we seek Jesus,
[2974.88 → 2975.98] may we find him,
[2976.74 → 2977.96] and may we worship him.
[2978.78 → 2979.62] Let's pray together.
[2979.62 → 2983.70] Father,
[2983.80 → 2984.32] we thank you
[2984.32 → 2984.74] for
[2984.74 → 2987.04] the humanity
[2987.04 → 2988.04] and the humility
[2988.04 → 2989.10] of our Lord Jesus
[2989.10 → 2990.30] who took on flesh,
[2991.70 → 2992.80] dwelt among us,
[2993.56 → 2994.48] was circumcised
[2994.48 → 2995.40] on the eighth day,
[2996.90 → 2998.30] became a Jew
[2998.30 → 3001.24] to free us
[3001.24 → 3002.42] from the law
[3002.42 → 3003.16] by keeping it
[3003.16 → 3004.34] perfectly for us,
[3005.06 → 3005.86] by dying
[3005.86 → 3006.88] in our place,
[3007.52 → 3008.62] taking the penalty
[3008.62 → 3009.58] that we deserve
[3009.58 → 3011.52] for our disobedience,
[3012.00 → 3012.94] our law-breaking,
[3013.66 → 3014.30] our rebellion
[3014.30 → 3015.62] against the true king,
[3016.56 → 3017.80] but dying for us,
[3018.22 → 3019.10] conquering death,
[3019.94 → 3020.94] rising again,
[3021.54 → 3022.20] and returning
[3022.20 → 3023.48] to the right hand
[3023.48 → 3024.72] of the throne of God
[3024.72 → 3026.02] where he now
[3026.02 → 3027.50] rules all things well
[3027.50 → 3028.86] and justly.
[3029.54 → 3029.88] Lord,
[3030.24 → 3031.98] as we come into 2024
[3031.98 → 3033.70] with many thoughts
[3033.70 → 3034.44] on our minds,
[3034.62 → 3035.06] plans
[3035.06 → 3037.02] that we might want to make,
[3038.12 → 3038.32] Lord,
[3038.32 → 3038.98] would our
[3038.98 → 3040.26] number one plan
[3040.26 → 3042.08] be to seek you
[3042.08 → 3044.22] and to find you
[3044.22 → 3045.96] and to worship you.
[3046.42 → 3047.68] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3048.02 → 3048.32] Amen.
[3052.26 → 3052.78] All right,
[3052.84 → 3053.46] so let's stand
[3053.46 → 3053.88] and let's sing
[3053.88 → 3054.98] a song of response.
[3056.18 → 3058.16] Lord of all hopefulness.
[3058.44 → 3059.74] This is on page five,
[3060.22 → 3060.70] or number,
[3061.08 → 3062.34] hymn number 558.
[3063.28 → 3064.44] So please rise
[3064.44 → 3065.30] and 558.
[3065.30 → 3070.94] five,
[3070.94 → 3072.90] wise vies.
[3073.40 → 3075.44] Pastor Peter,
[3075.44 → 3076.26] thank you.
[3077.38 → 3087.36] 歌 Martí
[3087.36 → 3091.36] honour
[3117.36 → 3123.66] Laurie, I'll be the best, Lord of all Zen.
[3124.66 → 3130.72] Our children's children, the youth come again.
[3131.18 → 3137.22] Give sinners, love, to do your society.
[3138.66 → 3145.18] With our sheep in our work, we'll do our Maris.
[3145.18 → 3154.14] God bless Jesus.
[3154.14 → 3156.94] God bless him now.
[3156.94 → 3169.82] Lord bless our Lord.
[3169.82 → 3199.80] Thank you.
[3199.82 → 3211.68] Would anybody like to suggest the next hymn?
[3213.68 → 3214.84] 121.
[3220.94 → 3223.04] 121, hymn 121.
[3224.18 → 3226.44] To the hills I lift my eyes.
[3226.44 → 3256.42] 121, hymn 121.
[3256.42 → 3261.42] How the Lord comes all the day.
[3262.42 → 3267.42] Hear the hills that are the same.
[3268.70 → 3274.18] Be the dark who brings us all.
[3274.74 → 3280.42] Fill the land which stir for all.
[3280.42 → 3286.42] Leave your sight in the east.
[3286.42 → 3292.42] Fill the sun that never sleeps.
[3292.42 → 3298.42] Fill the land which stir for all.
[3298.42 → 3302.42] Fill the land which stir for all.
[3302.42 → 3305.42] Fill the land with the land.
[3305.42 → 3308.42] Fill the land which stir for all.
[3308.42 → 3310.42] Fill the land which stir for all.
[3310.42 → 3340.40] CHOIR SINGS
[3340.42 → 3348.88] How about one more?
[3349.64 → 3352.34] Maybe from someone who hasn't suggested one yet.
[3355.86 → 3360.04] Does anybody remember four years ago when my son John suggested a song?
[3360.90 → 3362.90] Nobody had ever heard it before.
[3363.86 → 3364.82] That was a lot of fun.
[3365.60 → 3366.64] Sorry, did someone say one?
[3367.64 → 3368.08] 545.
[3370.42 → 3375.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3375.42 → 3405.42] 
[3405.42 → 3406.42] How about one more?
[3406.42 → 3407.42] 545.
[3407.42 → 3408.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3408.42 → 3410.42] How about one more?
[3410.42 → 3411.42] 545.
[3411.42 → 3414.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3414.42 → 3416.42] How about one more?
[3416.42 → 3417.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3417.42 → 3418.42] How about one more?
[3418.42 → 3419.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3419.42 → 3420.42] How about one more?
[3420.42 → 3421.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3421.42 → 3423.42] How about one more?
[3423.42 → 3424.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3424.42 → 3425.42] How about one more?
[3425.42 → 3426.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3426.42 → 3428.42] How about one more?
[3428.42 → 3430.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3430.42 → 3433.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3433.42 → 3434.42] How about one more?
[3434.42 → 3435.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3435.42 → 3436.42] How about one more?
[3436.42 → 3437.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3437.42 → 3438.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3438.42 → 3440.42] How about one more?
[3440.42 → 3442.42] CHOIR SINGS
[3442.42 → 3472.40] Let us pray.
[3472.42 → 3485.42] Surely he loved us to love for the soul He may be a gentle In the angel of your heart
[3485.42 → 3498.16] He names before, and then we are far beyond Give me to God in the greatest future
[3498.16 → 3502.64] And now we never know the eternal life.
[3506.96 → 3508.32] Okay, you may be seated.
[3515.68 → 3525.30] And for our community prayer, BEV Mantra sent me a suggestion almost a year ago.
[3525.30 → 3528.40] And she said, next New Year's Day, let's do this prayer.
[3528.78 → 3530.16] And I said, okay, I'll try to remember.
[3530.32 → 3532.02] So I made a file and I dated it.
[3532.10 → 3535.06] And so when it came up to today, I said, oh, there it is.
[3536.14 → 3541.18] So this is called A Prayer for the New Year by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[3541.58 → 3543.64] Now, some of you may be familiar with him, maybe not.
[3544.06 → 3546.88] But he was a German theologian and pastor.
[3548.08 → 3554.66] And this prayer, the Prayer for the New Year, is one of the very last things he wrote while in prison
[3554.66 → 3557.34] just months before he was executed.
[3558.68 → 3567.32] He sent the prayer to his fiancée, Marie, as an encouragement and a profession of faith to be shared with his family.
[3568.22 → 3573.78] And to this day, the prayer is regularly prayed in churches on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[3573.78 → 3580.16] Like so much of Bonhoeffer's writing, this prayer takes seriously the sorrows of life.
[3580.92 → 3586.70] But also, it confesses hope in the promise of God's graciousness and God's provision.
[3588.06 → 3591.28] And so for that reason, I think we will find this a suiting prayer.
[3592.06 → 3592.28] Yes.
[3592.28 → 3592.72] Yes.
[3599.50 → 3599.90] Okay.
[3600.58 → 3601.64] In our council report?
[3601.76 → 3602.14] Council report?
[3602.32 → 3602.50] Okay.
[3602.96 → 3606.16] We also, we missed the passing of Peter Using as well.
[3607.24 → 3607.56] Okay.
[3607.96 → 3609.00] Is there anything else we missed?
[3609.38 → 3610.74] That was certainly an important one.
[3611.96 → 3612.34] Okay.
[3612.38 → 3612.98] Thank you for that.
[3613.48 → 3614.96] It was a good reminder for all of us as well.
[3616.78 → 3617.14] Okay.
[3617.30 → 3619.54] So let us, let us come before the Lord in prayer.
[3619.54 → 3621.96] And I'll just be reading this prayer for the new year.
[3622.48 → 3622.94] Let's pray.
[3626.12 → 3636.78] With gracious, gracious powers for good, to uphold and guide us, comforted and inspired beyond all fear,
[3637.82 → 3645.56] we live our days with God behind and beside us and pass with you, Lord, into the coming year.
[3645.56 → 3675.20] Father, grant to the hearts you have been chastening.
[3675.20 → 3679.94] What you have promised, the healing and the cure.
[3680.74 → 3688.08] Should it be ours this year to drink the cup of grief, even to the dregs of pain, at your command,
[3688.18 → 3695.16] we wish not to falter, but confidently receive all that is given as held within your loving hand.
[3695.16 → 3701.10] And should it be your will to release us to life's enjoyments in its sweet light,
[3701.94 → 3710.94] may what we've learned from sorrow not diminish but increase us and all our life be lived as under your loving sight.
[3710.94 → 3719.38] With gracious powers for good to uphold us and guide us, with confidence we'll face tomorrow, be what it may.
[3720.32 → 3728.06] At evening and at morning, you, Lord, will be beside us and almost surely also on this New Year's Day.
[3728.06 → 3739.04] So, Lord, we do, using the words of this prayer again, we thank you for your graciousness that upholds us,
[3739.74 → 3741.80] your graciousness that guides us.
[3742.80 → 3748.06] Lord, we thank you for the confidence that we have, that we can face tomorrow, whatever may come,
[3748.06 → 3752.52] because you, Lord, walk with us.
[3752.94 → 3754.10] You are beside us.
[3754.20 → 3756.30] Lord, you know what this year has in store.
[3757.18 → 3758.74] Nothing is hidden from your sight.
[3760.10 → 3765.56] And, Lord, we, so we trust in you, the King of the Nations, the King of the Year.
[3766.60 → 3770.92] And, Lord, we ask that you would guide each one of us individually in our lives, guide our families, Lord,
[3771.78 → 3777.60] guide our decisions, guide our hearts to know and worship you.
[3778.06 → 3784.90] Would you guide us as a church to be a light and to be salt in this neighbourhood where we are?
[3785.76 → 3792.08] Lord, guide us to be faithful in prayer and in scripture and in preaching and in fellowship.
[3793.42 → 3797.38] Lord, guide all who serve in so many ways that we've said.
[3798.22 → 3801.30] Lord, comfort hearts that grieve for the passing of loved ones.
[3802.30 → 3804.16] And, Lord, give us joy as well.
[3804.16 → 3811.44] Joy in anything that you would have in store, knowing, Lord, that you are again in control.
[3811.68 → 3818.22] Lord, in the joy of our salvation, the joy of knowing you as King, the joy of the Holy Spirit's presence in our lives,
[3818.38 → 3822.60] the joy of having a church family to walk alongside with us.
[3822.60 → 3828.92] Lord, we trust in you because you are good and you are great.
[3830.20 → 3839.36] And so, Lord, we thank you for this first day of the new year when we can come before you to bow before you in our hearts and to acknowledge you.
[3839.62 → 3840.72] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3841.14 → 3841.42] Amen.
[3841.42 → 3841.50] Amen.
[3843.34 → 3844.38] So let's stand.
[3844.58 → 3847.42] Let's hear God's benediction over us.
[3847.76 → 3856.08] And there's one more chance for a song, because I don't think we've chosen one, but maybe one more song that someone may want to suggest for us today.
[3856.20 → 3856.80] So let's stand.
[3858.64 → 3864.60] May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[3865.46 → 3865.90] Amen.
[3865.90 → 3868.04] All right.
