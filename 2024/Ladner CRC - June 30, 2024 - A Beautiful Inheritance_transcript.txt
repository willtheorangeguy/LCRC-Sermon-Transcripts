[0.00 --> 9.56]  .
[9.56 --> 23.90]  .
[23.90 --> 53.88]  Thank you.
[53.90 --> 83.88]  Thank you.
[83.90 --> 113.88]  Thank you.
[113.90 --> 143.88]  Thank you.
[143.90 --> 173.88]  Thank you.
[173.90 --> 203.88]  Thank you.
[203.88 --> 206.84]  And so a few announcements.
[207.38 --> 213.28]  One is that beginning today, our Sunday school for the summer will actually just be combined
[213.28 --> 217.94]  into one class for ages three through grade three.
[217.94 --> 221.32]  And we'll dismiss them at the same time right before our sermon.
[221.32 --> 230.38]  And another good news is that some of you will know our church member, the Argos Kukuye had
[230.38 --> 233.30]  an accident and he's actually been released from the hospital.
[233.46 --> 234.30]  He's back home.
[234.30 --> 235.30]  And we're going to have a meal train going.
[264.30 --> 265.30]  And so we'll see you next week.
[294.30 --> 297.30]  And our call to worship comes from Psalm 29.
[297.30 --> 299.94]  And we will say this responsibly.
[299.94 --> 301.78]  So I will begin.
[301.78 --> 306.16]  Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings.
[306.16 --> 309.62]  Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[309.62 --> 313.58]  Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name.
[313.58 --> 314.58]  Worship the Lord in the splendor.
[314.58 --> 318.76]  Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
[318.76 --> 322.18]  The voice of the Lord is over the waters.
[322.18 --> 325.12]  The God of glory thunders.
[325.12 --> 329.36]  The Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
[329.36 --> 333.20]  And in his temple all cry glory.
[333.90 --> 339.28]  Would you please join me in prayer as we come before our Lord and praise him.
[339.38 --> 340.06]  Let's pray together.
[340.96 --> 349.16]  Our great father of glory, pure father of light, the heavens and the earth, all that is in them,
[349.96 --> 354.08]  the heavenly beings in your courts above, they all declare your glory.
[354.08 --> 357.86]  And your word brings joy to our hearts.
[359.60 --> 367.64]  Lord, may we give you the praise of our hearts, our mouths, and our lives this morning.
[368.32 --> 371.72]  Lord, would you lead us in wonder and awe at the beauty of who you are.
[372.40 --> 377.58]  Of your cross, your resurrection, your forgiveness, your pursuit of your people,
[378.00 --> 383.02]  your adoption of us as your children, your steadfast love and faithfulness.
[384.08 --> 387.42]  And we give you all glory, praise, and honor.
[387.54 --> 392.62]  And we praise you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[393.26 --> 393.60]  Amen.
[394.54 --> 395.42]  So let's stand.
[396.00 --> 404.00]  And as we receive God's greeting to us, also from Psalm 29, this is what it says,
[404.00 --> 410.26]  the Lord gives strength to his people, the Lord blesses his people with peace.
[410.72 --> 411.46]  Thanks be to God.
[411.56 --> 417.14]  So God has called us to worship him, and he's called us into a community with fellow brothers
[417.14 --> 418.58]  and sisters as the family of God.
[418.66 --> 420.88]  Let's turn and let's welcome and greet one another.
[421.04 --> 421.82]  In the name of Christ.
[421.82 --> 423.20]  That was mo rockets.
[423.20 --> 423.90]  Thank you.
[439.80 --> 440.76]  Thank you.
[441.42 --> 448.38]  Thank you.
[448.38 --> 478.36]  Thank you.
[478.38 --> 508.36]  Thank you.
[508.38 --> 510.38]  Thank you.
[538.38 --> 540.38]  Thank you.
[568.38 --> 570.38]  Thank you.
[570.38 --> 572.38]  Thank you.
[600.38 --> 602.38]  Thank you.
[630.38 --> 632.38]  Thank you.
[632.38 --> 634.38]  Thank you.
[660.38 --> 662.38]  Thank you.
[662.38 --> 664.38]  Thank you.
[664.38 --> 666.38]  Thank you.
[666.38 --> 668.38]  Thank you.
[668.38 --> 670.38]  Thank you.
[670.38 --> 672.38]  Thank you.
[672.38 --> 674.38]  Thank you.
[674.38 --> 676.38]  Thank you.
[676.38 --> 678.38]  Thank you.
[678.38 --> 680.38]  Thank you.
[680.38 --> 682.38]  Thank you.
[682.38 --> 684.38]  Thank you.
[684.38 --> 686.38]  Thank you.
[686.38 --> 688.38]  Thank you.
[688.38 --> 690.38]  Thank you.
[690.38 --> 692.38]  Thank you.
[692.38 --> 698.38]  Thank you.
[698.38 --> 700.38]  Thank you.
[700.38 --> 702.38]  Thank you.
[702.38 --> 704.38]  Thank you.
[704.38 --> 706.38]  Thank you.
[706.38 --> 708.38]  Thank you.
[708.38 --> 710.38]  Thank you.
[710.38 --> 712.38]  Thank you.
[712.38 --> 714.38]  Thank you.
[714.38 --> 716.38]  Thank you.
[716.38 --> 718.38]  Thank you.
[718.38 --> 720.38]  Thank you.
[720.38 --> 722.38]  Thank you.
[722.38 --> 724.38]  Thank you.
[724.38 --> 726.38]  Thank you.
[726.38 --> 728.38]  rejoice
[728.38 --> 730.38]  Behold
[730.38 --> 732.38]  our God
[734.08 --> 736.38]  seated on His throne
[737.06 --> 738.38]  Come let us
[738.70 --> 740.38]  adore Him
[741.26 --> 742.38]  Behold
[743.50 --> 744.38]  our King
[746.06 --> 748.38]  Nothing can compare
[749.02 --> 750.70]  Come let us
[750.70 --> 752.38]  adore Him
[752.38 --> 762.38]  Who has given
[762.38 --> 764.38]  counsel to the
[764.38 --> 766.38]  Lord
[766.38 --> 768.38]  Who can
[768.38 --> 770.38]  question
[770.38 --> 772.38]  of His words
[772.38 --> 774.38]  Who can teach
[774.38 --> 776.38]  the one who knows
[776.38 --> 778.38]  all things
[778.38 --> 780.38]  Who can
[780.38 --> 782.38]  gather
[782.38 --> 784.38]  all His hundreds
[784.38 --> 786.38]  deeds
[786.38 --> 788.38]  Behold

[816.38 --> 818.38]  hands
[818.38 --> 820.38]  Heirs
[820.38 --> 822.38]  Heirs
[822.38 --> 824.38]  Bearing
[824.38 --> 826.38]  all the
[826.38 --> 828.38]  gift of sinful
[828.38 --> 830.38]  health
[830.38 --> 832.38]  God eternal
[832.38 --> 834.38]  humble to the grave
[834.38 --> 836.38]  Jesus
[836.38 --> 838.38]  Savior
[838.38 --> 840.38]  risen now to
[840.38 --> 842.38]  God
[842.38 --> 844.38]  Behold

[860.38 --> 862.38]  Come let us adore Him
[862.38 --> 878.38]  Come let us adore��

[880.38 --> 882.38]  Se Austin
[882.38 --> 884.38]  Come let us adore Him
[884.38 --> 886.38]  Come let us adore Him
[886.38 --> 888.38]  Come let us adore Him
[888.38 --> 891.18]  Over there.
[918.38 --> 921.62]  If you'd like to turn there, you may, or you may follow along on the screen.
[925.62 --> 930.28]  So Acts chapter 2, verses 22 to 33.
[936.08 --> 938.90]  Men of Israel, listen to this.
[939.78 --> 945.86]  Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs,
[945.86 --> 947.96]  which God did among you through him.
[948.38 --> 954.42]  As you yourselves know, this man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge,
[954.88 --> 959.52]  and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
[960.10 --> 964.24]  But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death,
[964.72 --> 967.72]  because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
[968.70 --> 972.40]  David said about him, I saw the Lord always before me,
[972.40 --> 975.80]  because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
[975.80 --> 979.40]  Therefore, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[979.84 --> 984.58]  My body will also live in hope, because you will not abandon me to the grave,
[984.92 --> 987.34]  nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
[987.86 --> 990.14]  You have made known to me the paths of life.
[990.64 --> 992.86]  You will fill me with joy in your presence.
[993.74 --> 998.14]  Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried,
[998.50 --> 1000.12]  and his tomb is here to this day.
[1000.12 --> 1003.94]  But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him an oath,
[1004.26 --> 1007.50]  that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
[1008.48 --> 1012.72]  Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,
[1013.04 --> 1016.86]  that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.
[1017.50 --> 1022.58]  God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.
[1022.58 --> 1024.90]  He is exalted to the right hand of God.
[1025.46 --> 1028.28]  He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit,
[1028.62 --> 1032.32]  and has poured out what you now see and hear.
[1033.10 --> 1034.38]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1034.92 --> 1035.96]  Thanks be to God.
[1036.30 --> 1039.38]  So you may remain seated as we sing our next song.
[1039.38 --> 1061.92]  Holy Spirit, living death of God,
[1061.92 --> 1067.06]  breathe new life into my living soul.
[1067.06 --> 1074.52]  Lord, bring the presence of the risen Lord,
[1074.52 --> 1080.82]  to renew my heart and make me whole.
[1081.70 --> 1087.60]  Cause your word to come alive in me.
[1088.36 --> 1093.90]  Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[1093.90 --> 1099.58]  Give me passion for your purity.
[1099.58 --> 1106.04]  Holy Spirit, breathe new life into me.
[1107.04 --> 1113.08]  Holy Spirit, come alive with him.
[1113.08 --> 1118.24]  May your joy be seen in all I do.
[1118.24 --> 1119.96]  Not only for you.
[1119.96 --> 1121.66]  name a cable man.
[1121.66 --> 1125.92]  worthy God to cover every sin,
[1126.46 --> 1130.34]  in each part and deed and attitude.
[1133.88 --> 1136.56]  I'm blessed to embrace.
[1136.56 --> 1139.06]  I'm blessed and blessed.
[1139.30 --> 1140.38]  Thank you.
[1140.38 --> 1144.14]  This strength of God will help us to like Rafael Rozella.
[1144.14 --> 1146.14]  Amen.
[1174.14 --> 1176.14]  Amen.
[1204.14 --> 1206.14]  Amen.
[1218.40 --> 1229.58]  So for our time of confession, as a call to repentance, let's read, look at here, Isaiah chapter 55, verses 6 and 7.
[1229.58 --> 1231.82]  It says,
[1231.82 --> 1260.42]  And, you know, I love that invitation in that promise that the Lord will freely pardon us when we confess our sins to him.
[1260.42 --> 1266.14]  You know, and it's very much like any relationship that we have with one another.
[1266.50 --> 1274.08]  You know, sometimes a relationship, say, with your spouse, perhaps there is some tension or there's some difficulty,
[1274.70 --> 1277.22]  and it's because of the way we treat one another.
[1277.22 --> 1282.40]  But then if I say, you know, to my wife, Christy, you know, Christy, I am so sorry.
[1283.34 --> 1284.82]  I've just been such an idiot.
[1285.02 --> 1286.12]  I have treated you poorly.
[1286.56 --> 1288.12]  I've been grumpy today.
[1288.54 --> 1290.24]  Would you please just forgive me?
[1290.68 --> 1298.52]  You know, when you do that, what happens is you repent, you apologize, and then there's like this sweetness that comes in, right?
[1298.52 --> 1304.98]  And, you know, there's a sense of intimacy that's been restored again, and there's joy in the relationship.
[1305.74 --> 1314.16]  And that is what God invites us to do in confession, is to acknowledge that we are the ones who sin.
[1314.16 --> 1322.92]  And when we do that, you know, we make our feeling of our experience of our relationship with God feel like there's some tension there.
[1323.02 --> 1330.94]  But when we just open our hearts to God and say, I'm sorry, we can feel the sweetness of his forgiveness for us.
[1331.54 --> 1337.18]  And so let us, please join me in prayer as we confess our sins to God.
[1337.26 --> 1338.86]  Please join me and I'll pray for us.
[1338.86 --> 1356.10]  Oh, mighty God and Father, we confess to you and to one another and to the whole company of heaven that we have sinned through our own fault in thought and word and deed in what we have done and what we have left undone.
[1357.00 --> 1360.86]  For the sake of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon us.
[1361.20 --> 1362.80]  Forgive us our sins.
[1362.80 --> 1371.86]  And by the power of your Holy Spirit, raise us up to serve you in newness of life to the glory of your name.
[1372.80 --> 1374.96]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1376.64 --> 1384.64]  And the good news of the gospel is that we, who are all sinners, have been forgiven freely by his grace.
[1384.64 --> 1388.02]  Our sins have been fully paid for at the cross.
[1388.40 --> 1393.14]  And Jesus' perfect righteousness has been credited to our account.
[1393.94 --> 1397.70]  And so hear God's words of grace to you from 1 Peter.
[1397.70 --> 1402.88]  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1403.52 --> 1415.86]  In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[1416.40 --> 1420.04]  This inheritance is kept in heaven for you.
[1420.04 --> 1432.78]  So let's respond to God's grace and let's all stand again and we will respond to the sweetness of God's mercy to us in this next song as we sing together.
[1432.78 --> 1434.78]  Amen.
[1434.78 --> 1435.78]  Amen.
[1435.78 --> 1436.78]  Amen.
[1462.78 --> 1464.78]  Amen.
[1492.78 --> 1494.78]  Amen.
[1522.78 --> 1524.78]  Amen.
[1552.78 --> 1569.86]  My heart's one desire is to be holy, set apart for you, Lord.
[1569.86 --> 1588.88]  I choose to be holy, set apart for you, my Master, ready to do your will.
[1599.86 --> 1609.42]  So, the kids are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1610.70 --> 1612.20]  Class, one class.
[1621.36 --> 1628.42]  All right, so this summer, we are exploring the Psalms, which I'm very excited about.
[1628.42 --> 1633.80]  And the Psalms are this amazing songbook in the Bible.
[1634.00 --> 1636.66]  You know how we have hymnals in our pews?
[1637.26 --> 1643.02]  Well, for God's people, both in the Old Testament and the New, they would have a hymnal that was actually the Psalms.
[1643.08 --> 1644.78]  They would sing these Psalms.
[1645.44 --> 1648.40]  They were written to be prayed and also to be sung.
[1649.14 --> 1655.82]  You know, and that tells us, because thinking about the Psalms as being sung in the congregation, in the synagogues, in the church,
[1655.82 --> 1663.18]  it tells us that the Psalms were not only to instruct us just with objective truths about God,
[1663.76 --> 1666.02]  but that they are to stir us, right?
[1666.06 --> 1667.66]  Much in the way that music does.
[1668.78 --> 1673.90]  C.S. Lewis says this about the Psalms in his little book, Reflections on the Psalms.
[1674.72 --> 1676.88]  He said, it's up there, I think, right?
[1676.88 --> 1677.52]  Yep.
[1678.16 --> 1695.40]  The most valuable thing the Psalms do for me is to express the same delight in God, which made David dance.
[1695.40 --> 1700.02]  So maybe at the end of the sermon, we'll have some of us dancing in the aisles, right?
[1700.12 --> 1704.04]  We reformed the Costals or something.
[1704.04 --> 1713.66]  So what we want to do with these Psalms and what we want them to do for us is to help us draw near to God in this way
[1713.66 --> 1720.74]  so that we can delight in him, so that we can love him with all of our heart, soul, and mind and strength
[1720.74 --> 1722.18]  and to delight in him.
[1722.28 --> 1725.68]  So let's turn to Psalm 16 this morning in our Bibles.
[1728.28 --> 1729.36]  Psalm 16.
[1729.36 --> 1729.44]  Psalm 16.
[1734.04 --> 1735.64]  That's where we'll be today.
[1736.18 --> 1736.94]  Psalm 16.
[1737.36 --> 1739.52]  It's on page 405 in your pew Bible.
[1742.34 --> 1745.18]  And let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[1746.38 --> 1750.80]  Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take refuge.
[1751.66 --> 1754.64]  I said to the Lord, you are my Lord.
[1754.76 --> 1756.52]  Apart from you, I have no good thing.
[1756.52 --> 1762.56]  As for the saints who are in the land, they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight.
[1762.56 --> 1767.10]  The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods.
[1767.36 --> 1773.44]  I will not pour out their libations or of blood or take up their names on my lips.
[1774.02 --> 1777.30]  Lord, you have assigned me my portion in my cup.
[1777.82 --> 1779.58]  You have made my lot secure.
[1780.26 --> 1783.12]  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.
[1783.96 --> 1785.94]  Surely I have a delightful inheritance.
[1786.74 --> 1788.96]  I will praise the Lord who counsels me.
[1789.06 --> 1790.90]  Even at night my heart instructs me.
[1790.90 --> 1793.84]  I have set the Lord always before me.
[1794.02 --> 1796.96]  Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
[1797.88 --> 1801.02]  Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[1801.76 --> 1803.56]  My body also will rest secure.
[1804.02 --> 1808.86]  Because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
[1809.44 --> 1811.72]  You have made known to me the path of life.
[1812.40 --> 1818.34]  You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
[1818.34 --> 1820.10]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1820.10 --> 1827.20]  Please join me in prayer as we pray for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word this morning.
[1828.26 --> 1834.90]  Father, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[1834.90 --> 1840.86]  And as we look at your word today, we pray that you would help us to see Jesus more clearly.
[1841.28 --> 1842.96]  And to draw near to you.
[1843.52 --> 1847.02]  And we pray that by faith we may receive what you have given to us.
[1847.12 --> 1849.64]  So that we would be blessed by you.
[1850.54 --> 1852.08]  And we ask this in Jesus' name.
[1852.48 --> 1852.78]  Amen.
[1852.78 --> 1852.86]  Amen.
[1854.24 --> 1860.26]  So this week I learned some rather exciting news that I want to share with you.
[1860.94 --> 1865.18]  Actually, I am going to be an heir to a rather nice inheritance.
[1866.52 --> 1868.90]  My wife and children are very excited.
[1869.84 --> 1874.46]  It's quite surprising actually because it's not from my mother or my father.
[1875.08 --> 1878.60]  And the person who is giving me this inheritance is incredibly generous.
[1878.60 --> 1882.24]  And upon certain conditions I will get this inheritance.
[1883.16 --> 1888.68]  And when I do get this inheritance, I can assure you that there will be no need for me to be a pastor anymore.
[1891.50 --> 1894.34]  Now, some of you are probably wondering about this.
[1895.50 --> 1901.66]  If you are paying close attention to Psalm 16, you'll realize that indeed you also have an inheritance.
[1901.66 --> 1909.00]  One from a person who is able to give and give and give.
[1909.66 --> 1914.20]  And it's an inheritance that certainly should make us excited.
[1915.26 --> 1918.76]  Now, maybe I did convince some of you that I recently came into a lot of money.
[1920.10 --> 1921.62]  Well, that would have been rather nice too.
[1922.90 --> 1930.52]  But some of us have to be reminded over and over again by God about the things that actually really matter.
[1930.52 --> 1931.20]  Right?
[1931.86 --> 1933.18]  And I speak for myself here.
[1933.36 --> 1935.10]  I need to be reminded by God of this.
[1935.20 --> 1937.40]  And maybe I speak for some of you as well.
[1938.40 --> 1943.50]  You know, as C.S. Lewis, again, famously said, and I won't quote the whole thing, but this is the phrase,
[1944.10 --> 1946.44]  we are far too easily satisfied.
[1947.80 --> 1952.90]  We are far too easily satisfied by the things of this world.
[1952.90 --> 1958.36]  When God has so much more in store for us that he has given us.
[1958.36 --> 1962.38]  And that is what David reminds us here in Psalm 16.
[1962.70 --> 1969.02]  And that we actually do have an inheritance that is worth being excited about.
[1969.52 --> 1975.36]  And it's a gift from a generous and loving Heavenly Father that we receive through faith in Jesus Christ.
[1976.14 --> 1982.48]  So as we look at Psalm 16, the structure of the psalm is that it's actually just a series of couplets.
[1982.48 --> 1984.82]  Okay, so there are six couplets.
[1985.26 --> 1992.66]  And each one of them tells us something about this delightful, to use this word here in the psalm,
[1992.74 --> 1997.46]  delightful inheritance that we have from God, our Heavenly Father.
[1998.38 --> 2002.66]  So what I want to do is just kind of look through the psalm line by line, couplet by couplet,
[2003.16 --> 2007.58]  and see what it is, who God is, and how he has blessed us.
[2007.58 --> 2014.34]  So the first thing we see that we learn about our inheritance is that we have God's protection.
[2014.90 --> 2015.88]  Okay, we have God's protection.
[2016.26 --> 2018.42]  And we see that in verses 1 and 2.
[2019.46 --> 2024.28]  Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.
[2024.46 --> 2027.00]  I say to the Lord, you are my Lord.
[2027.12 --> 2029.10]  Apart from you, I have no good thing.
[2029.42 --> 2033.66]  Or it means I have no well-being or welfare.
[2034.22 --> 2035.74]  Apart from you, I have no other welfare.
[2035.74 --> 2041.36]  So you can see here that there is some context.
[2041.58 --> 2047.84]  There is something that is happening in David's life where he feels the need for God to take care of him.
[2048.82 --> 2051.60]  So, you know, things for David look bleak.
[2052.18 --> 2055.56]  Maybe things are looking like there's anguish.
[2055.66 --> 2056.84]  I'm crying out.
[2057.32 --> 2060.22]  And immediately, he doesn't dwell on that.
[2060.32 --> 2063.50]  Immediately, he turns to God for safety.
[2063.50 --> 2068.84]  He says, keep me safe, for in you I take refuge.
[2070.26 --> 2077.34]  And David reminds us here that in the midst of anguish and troubles, you know, in David's life, he went through all kinds of hardships.
[2078.06 --> 2081.72]  But that the most important thing is not who you are.
[2082.34 --> 2087.54]  It's not what our circumstances is, but it is who God is for you.
[2088.04 --> 2089.64]  That is the most important thing.
[2089.64 --> 2094.42]  If God is for me, who can be against me?
[2094.76 --> 2094.90]  Right?
[2094.98 --> 2096.26]  As the Apostle Paul put it.
[2097.68 --> 2102.90]  But it's not enough just to know, oh yeah, God is there.
[2103.06 --> 2104.20]  God is a refuge.
[2105.00 --> 2110.02]  The question is, do you actually go to God when you're in trouble?
[2110.02 --> 2116.82]  When things are going on in your life, do you run to him?
[2116.94 --> 2119.16]  Is he a refuge for you?
[2120.78 --> 2126.96]  So, Christy was always at home with the kids until the last few years when she started to work as a teacher.
[2127.50 --> 2132.02]  And so, recently, it's been my job to get the kids out the door to school in the mornings.
[2132.02 --> 2137.20]  And we have given them nice rain jackets, nice rain boots.
[2138.02 --> 2142.54]  But more often than not, as they head out the door, they do it without their rain jackets.
[2142.92 --> 2150.68]  And I'll say, hey, the weather app says it's going to rain this afternoon and you are going to get wet on your way home.
[2150.68 --> 2153.34]  But they say, we're fine.
[2153.48 --> 2154.38]  We don't need it.
[2154.76 --> 2155.00]  You know.
[2155.34 --> 2156.30]  And then they come home.
[2156.36 --> 2156.56]  How?
[2157.44 --> 2158.14]  Soaking wet.
[2158.70 --> 2161.54]  And I say, you have a rain jacket.
[2161.86 --> 2163.04]  It's right there.
[2163.44 --> 2164.90]  Why didn't you use it?
[2165.14 --> 2165.28]  Right?
[2165.32 --> 2169.70]  You have something to protect you and you just didn't use it.
[2171.16 --> 2175.50]  Is that our experience of God as a refuge?
[2175.64 --> 2176.82]  Is that what it's like for us?
[2176.82 --> 2177.38]  Right?
[2177.48 --> 2181.08]  Where God is our refuge is part of our inheritance.
[2181.38 --> 2183.96]  But for some of us, we just know that in theory.
[2184.86 --> 2186.24]  But do we actually go to him?
[2186.28 --> 2188.08]  Do we actually put him on?
[2188.16 --> 2190.00]  Do we actually hide under his wings?
[2190.60 --> 2192.70]  Is he our refuge and our strength?
[2193.86 --> 2197.02]  And the point of verses 1 and 2 is this.
[2197.10 --> 2199.34]  That the bedrock of your inheritance, right?
[2199.34 --> 2206.10]  Actually, the very foundation of the Christian life is who God is for you.
[2206.82 --> 2214.30]  And that he invites us to experience that by actually going to him as our refuge.
[2215.04 --> 2217.38]  And so this psalm is a psalm of trust.
[2217.98 --> 2223.44]  And it's an invitation to have that kind of deep experiential relationship with God.
[2223.48 --> 2226.02]  Not just to know objectively that, yeah, God's a refuge.
[2226.48 --> 2228.32]  But to experience him in that way.
[2230.16 --> 2231.82]  So first we have God's protection.
[2232.14 --> 2234.06]  Now what is the next thing that David says?
[2234.14 --> 2235.56]  He speaks of God's people.
[2235.56 --> 2237.52]  Look at verse 3.
[2237.92 --> 2243.88]  I say of the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.
[2244.70 --> 2248.56]  Now this is interesting because he's just made this very lofty confession.
[2249.30 --> 2251.24]  Lord, I have no God apart from you.
[2252.04 --> 2254.92]  You know, you are my Lord.
[2254.92 --> 2263.74]  And then immediately he turns his eyes to the people of God, to the tangible community of God's people.
[2263.84 --> 2268.14]  And he says, I love, I delight in my fellow brothers and sisters.
[2268.66 --> 2272.00]  They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.
[2272.00 --> 2276.28]  And so David is confessing this before the Lord.
[2276.60 --> 2279.32]  He's confessing his delight in God's people.
[2279.44 --> 2282.44]  The saints of God delight in one another.
[2284.04 --> 2286.26]  And so let me pose this question to you this morning.
[2286.26 --> 2289.98]  Are God's people a delight to you?
[2291.54 --> 2292.76]  That's a little challenging.
[2293.80 --> 2297.32]  Are God's people a delight to you?
[2298.96 --> 2300.44]  And so think about this.
[2300.50 --> 2305.18]  What does it mean to be a Christian who is part of a Christian community?
[2305.18 --> 2310.36]  Well, it means primarily that you are part of a family of God's people.
[2311.02 --> 2311.24]  Right?
[2311.32 --> 2313.42]  Where you worship with God's people.
[2313.54 --> 2314.56]  That's what we're doing now.
[2315.38 --> 2317.58]  And you interact with God's people.
[2318.42 --> 2324.18]  Such that you can actually say, these are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.
[2324.98 --> 2330.22]  Because the thing that God loves most in this world is his people.
[2330.22 --> 2335.70]  And we are to love that which God loves.
[2336.94 --> 2342.42]  Now Eugene Peterson, in his book, Along Obedience in the Same Direction, he says this.
[2344.22 --> 2346.68]  We are a family in Christ.
[2347.30 --> 2349.00]  No Christian is an only child.
[2349.80 --> 2355.52]  But of course, just because we are a family of faith, doesn't mean we are one big happy family.
[2355.52 --> 2360.60]  The people we encounter as brothers and sisters in faith are not always nice people.
[2361.32 --> 2365.06]  They do not stop being sinners the moment we begin believing in Christ.
[2365.74 --> 2372.40]  They don't suddenly change into brilliant conversationalists, exciting companions, and glowing inspirations.
[2373.48 --> 2374.82]  Some of them are cranky.
[2376.16 --> 2383.28]  But at the same time, our Lord tells us that they are brothers and sisters in faith.
[2383.28 --> 2386.86]  If God is my father, then this is my family.
[2387.82 --> 2392.34]  And so the question is not, am I going to be part of this community of faith?
[2392.62 --> 2397.94]  But rather, how am I going to live in this community of faith?
[2398.88 --> 2401.52]  In other words, am I going to delight in it?
[2402.68 --> 2409.76]  And in Psalm 16, God's people, you know, they're not only those with whom we share this inheritance.
[2410.88 --> 2412.68]  They are part of the inheritance.
[2413.28 --> 2413.98]  Do you see that?
[2414.98 --> 2420.48]  Part of our inheritance is a family of faith that we have.
[2420.54 --> 2422.96]  This is God's good gift to us.
[2424.86 --> 2433.14]  And so as we move on, David obviously there in verse 4 contrasts God's people with those who worship idols.
[2433.14 --> 2440.22]  But then he moves on and he goes from God's people then to God's provision in verses 5 and 6.
[2441.40 --> 2444.46]  And here, again, he comes back to who God is.
[2445.16 --> 2445.28]  Right?
[2445.38 --> 2448.04]  He just, he started with this confession.
[2448.44 --> 2449.86]  You know, you are my Lord.
[2449.92 --> 2451.18]  I have nothing apart from you.
[2451.34 --> 2454.38]  And then he turns to the people of God and says, I delight in them.
[2454.44 --> 2455.24]  They come from you.
[2455.24 --> 2458.76]  And then now, again, he comes back to the Lord.
[2459.28 --> 2461.20]  And we see this here in verses 5 and 6.
[2461.20 --> 2488.68]  So now, for the people of God, the land of Canaan was God's people's inheritance in a very tangible, physical, earthly manner for them to see.
[2488.68 --> 2490.88]  And to know that this is our inheritance.
[2491.12 --> 2493.16]  This is the gift that God has given us.
[2493.86 --> 2499.58]  But David here declares that God himself is in his inheritance.
[2499.92 --> 2504.02]  He says, Lord, you alone are my portion in my cup.
[2504.60 --> 2511.78]  And what he's doing here is David is actually speaking here as though he were a Levitical priest.
[2512.06 --> 2514.56]  He's not, but that's how he's speaking.
[2514.56 --> 2522.58]  So if you remember, when God brought his people out of Egypt into the promised land, there were 12 tribes of Israel.
[2523.02 --> 2531.46]  And so God divided all the land and said, all of you can have this land except for the Levites.
[2532.02 --> 2534.94]  Because they're going to be my holy people.
[2535.22 --> 2537.14]  They're going to be set apart as priests.
[2537.14 --> 2543.02]  So in other words, for the Levites, God says to them, you don't get any land, you get me.
[2543.86 --> 2544.08]  Right?
[2544.20 --> 2546.80]  I am going to be your reward.
[2547.72 --> 2554.46]  And David here, instead of being like, oh man, those poor guys, they don't get any of the land.
[2555.06 --> 2556.58]  David's like, that's amazing.
[2557.32 --> 2558.84]  That is the best.
[2558.94 --> 2560.34]  I want to be like them.
[2560.60 --> 2562.58]  I want to have God like that.
[2562.58 --> 2568.54]  Surely, I have a delightful inheritance in God.
[2569.40 --> 2569.52]  Right?
[2569.58 --> 2573.22]  And so this is God, this is David, treasuring God.
[2574.14 --> 2580.04]  Seeing God as of greater value than anything else that this world has to offer.
[2582.54 --> 2589.84]  And then notice another thing here where he says, you make my lot secure.
[2589.84 --> 2590.84]  Right?
[2591.68 --> 2594.86]  This means that our inheritance is certain.
[2596.00 --> 2598.70]  God is the one who holds our lot.
[2599.18 --> 2601.32]  God is the one in control.
[2601.54 --> 2604.32]  God is the one who is able to give.
[2605.72 --> 2608.96]  And then that language, you know, it carries forward into the New Testament.
[2609.78 --> 2615.46]  So in Matthew 25, chapter 25, verse 34, for example, it says this.
[2615.46 --> 2622.56]  Then the king will say to those on his right, come, you who are blessed by my father, take your inheritance.
[2623.00 --> 2625.90]  The kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
[2627.16 --> 2637.76]  Or as we read earlier in 1 Peter, we have this inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, unfading, kept in heaven for you.
[2637.76 --> 2644.84]  Or as Paul echoes in 2 Timothy, the Lord will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom.
[2646.64 --> 2653.64]  And so that leads us then to the next thing we learn about our inheritance as we go through the psalm in verses 7 to 8.
[2654.56 --> 2659.22]  And we learn here that the Lord preserves us in that inheritance.
[2660.16 --> 2661.88]  So the Lord's preservation.
[2663.00 --> 2666.28]  So let's have a look there at verses 7 and 8.
[2666.28 --> 2670.12]  I will praise the Lord who counsels me.
[2670.56 --> 2672.72]  Even at night my heart instructs me.
[2673.32 --> 2675.44]  I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
[2675.62 --> 2678.16]  With him in my right hand I will not be shaken.
[2679.66 --> 2686.22]  So notice how David's relationship with God is being talked about here.
[2687.08 --> 2691.42]  He says, I will praise the Lord who gives me counsel.
[2692.24 --> 2693.90]  I will praise the Lord who gives me counsel.
[2694.00 --> 2695.42]  It's a two-way relationship.
[2696.28 --> 2700.90]  So in other words, it's not just me praising the Lord, but it's the Lord counseling me.
[2701.44 --> 2702.72]  He gives me counsel.
[2703.86 --> 2707.08]  So how do you receive counsel from the Lord?
[2708.04 --> 2715.66]  Well, of course, we receive counsel from the Lord through his word, through preaching, through studying the Bible, through reading it.
[2715.66 --> 2726.24]  But I think even also in the context of the psalm, we can say that we receive counsel from the Lord through the noble ones in whom I delight.
[2727.00 --> 2727.22]  Right?
[2727.28 --> 2730.60]  In other words, through the brothers and sisters that we have in the Lord.
[2730.86 --> 2731.14]  Right?
[2731.18 --> 2736.46]  As we share our lives together, as we counsel one another, speak God's word to one another.
[2736.46 --> 2747.74]  And what's also implied here is that this word that comes to David, to us, must be able to challenge us.
[2748.22 --> 2750.42]  He must be able to counsel us, to shape us.
[2751.62 --> 2757.28]  You know, and so that means for God to be God in your life, he must be able to counsel you.
[2757.90 --> 2759.42]  He must be able to change you.
[2759.42 --> 2765.22]  So a few years ago, Marie Kondo was all the rage.
[2765.30 --> 2766.36]  You guys, do you remember that?
[2766.56 --> 2767.60]  This trend, Marie Kondo?
[2768.42 --> 2768.98]  Raise your hand.
[2769.04 --> 2769.80]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[2769.84 --> 2770.34]  Marie Kondo?
[2770.34 --> 2770.38]  Marie Kondo?
[2770.60 --> 2779.98]  It's like this home decluttering method to kind of like declutter your life, declutter your relationship with stuff.
[2780.46 --> 2780.98]  So that's what it is.
[2781.12 --> 2785.34]  And so basically it's like minimalize, throw stuff out that doesn't spark joy.
[2785.98 --> 2787.78]  So you hold something, you're like, does this spark joy?
[2788.26 --> 2788.54]  No.
[2788.54 --> 2789.62]  Get rid of it.
[2790.00 --> 2790.14]  Okay?
[2790.30 --> 2790.94]  Good way to clean.
[2791.88 --> 2797.62]  Now, the Babylon Bee is this like Christian satire website.
[2797.82 --> 2798.86]  It's wonderful.
[2799.48 --> 2805.98]  And it jokingly spoke about how Christians are adopting the Marie Kondo method to the Bible.
[2806.84 --> 2810.98]  To remove any verse from the Bible that does not spark joy.
[2812.08 --> 2814.52]  Of course, what you're left with is like two verses.
[2814.52 --> 2819.56]  Now, there's a whole lot wrong with that method.
[2820.26 --> 2820.36]  Right?
[2820.44 --> 2824.22]  So number one, that's not how we approach God in the Bible.
[2824.86 --> 2833.16]  Number two, Christians, because of our faith in God, we have a unique relationship with God's challenging word.
[2833.86 --> 2834.08]  Right?
[2834.08 --> 2837.82]  We allow his word to create joy in us.
[2837.90 --> 2842.34]  It's not like I'm the measure of whether or not it sparks me joy.
[2842.54 --> 2848.36]  But we submit ourselves to God's word and we say, Lord, give me joy in what you say to us.
[2849.10 --> 2849.42]  Right?
[2849.42 --> 2853.30]  We allow his word to shape us, to conform us to God's will.
[2853.98 --> 2860.54]  Because we know that his word, these words are from our heavenly father who loves us and who cares for us.
[2861.34 --> 2861.44]  Right?
[2861.50 --> 2866.48]  And so those parts of the Bible that kind of hurt, we're like, ah, you know, that's kind of painful.
[2866.48 --> 2870.80]  Because it's like knocking some rough parts off of us.
[2871.44 --> 2873.08]  We receive it with joy.
[2873.68 --> 2875.18]  Because it's from our heavenly father.
[2875.56 --> 2881.38]  And we know that God's word, though it corrects us and it shapes us, these words are going to bring healing.
[2882.02 --> 2883.50]  And they are going to preserve life.
[2884.58 --> 2892.54]  So for Christians, like David here, if we have a real relationship with God, we are willing to receive counsel from the Lord.
[2892.54 --> 2896.20]  And we're willing to take it to heart, so to speak.
[2897.62 --> 2903.32]  And that's how, as verse 8 says, that's how we keep our eyes always on the Lord.
[2904.56 --> 2911.58]  So friends, if you think about what this psalm is saying, if you keep your eyes always on the Lord, you're receiving counsel from the Lord,
[2912.22 --> 2917.50]  you are going to be living a Christian life that I would say is a successful Christian life.
[2918.78 --> 2918.92]  Right?
[2918.96 --> 2919.46]  Imagine that.
[2919.46 --> 2928.88]  If you're just like living your Christian life, keeping the Lord before your eyes, receiving counsel from him, and living that out, that is a successful Christian life.
[2930.76 --> 2932.64]  So God preserves us.
[2932.66 --> 2935.24]  And then he makes promises to us.
[2936.18 --> 2937.38]  So I didn't tell you up ahead.
[2937.46 --> 2940.04]  This is going to be a six-point sermon because I didn't want you to, like, get worried.
[2941.00 --> 2943.32]  But we're on point five already, so now I can tell you.
[2944.16 --> 2945.90]  Okay, so point five.
[2945.90 --> 2948.96]  God makes promises to us.
[2948.98 --> 2950.54]  And we see this in verses 9 to 10.
[2951.88 --> 2956.88]  Therefore, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[2957.78 --> 2958.68]  Let's stop there.
[2960.16 --> 2961.76]  Why would David say that?
[2962.78 --> 2963.94]  Remember, he's in trouble.
[2964.06 --> 2965.44]  That's the context of the psalm.
[2965.50 --> 2966.38]  Like, he's in anguish.
[2966.42 --> 2967.40]  He's crying out to God.
[2967.40 --> 2971.00]  But he's saying, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[2972.72 --> 2974.44]  You know, and again, think about David's life.
[2974.74 --> 2976.58]  His own son tried to kill him.
[2977.38 --> 2978.72]  The king tried to kill him.
[2978.96 --> 2979.20]  Saul.
[2979.92 --> 2980.14]  Right?
[2980.22 --> 2981.36]  He fought a giant.
[2981.52 --> 2982.62]  He fought wild animals.
[2982.96 --> 2985.30]  He was under tremendous pressure as a king.
[2985.52 --> 2987.16]  He had the weight of his own sin.
[2987.58 --> 2990.56]  And yet he can say, my heart is glad.
[2990.74 --> 2992.30]  My tongue rejoices.
[2992.30 --> 2994.78]  How can he say that?
[2995.68 --> 2997.34]  It's because of God's promises.
[2998.84 --> 3003.52]  David says, my body also will rest secure.
[3004.00 --> 3007.14]  Because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead.
[3007.50 --> 3010.50]  You will not let your faithful one see decay.
[3011.84 --> 3012.00]  Right?
[3012.08 --> 3017.38]  David had a clear view of the fact that whether in life or in death,
[3017.38 --> 3021.92]  he belongs to God and our faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[3022.06 --> 3022.16]  Right?
[3022.22 --> 3024.10]  And God will preserve him.
[3024.96 --> 3026.44]  God will be his refuge.
[3026.62 --> 3027.66]  God will be his strength.
[3028.02 --> 3029.48]  God has made promises to him.
[3029.56 --> 3031.96]  He holds his lot secure.
[3033.24 --> 3037.00]  And so he can face any difficulty because of God's promises.
[3037.82 --> 3041.44]  Now, we're going to come back to this verse in a moment.
[3041.44 --> 3044.28]  But first, let's continue and finish out Psalm 16.
[3044.28 --> 3050.68]  Because David then moves from the promises of God to the pleasures of God in verse 11.
[3050.92 --> 3051.84]  The very last verse.
[3052.80 --> 3055.78]  Verse 11 says, you make known to me the path of life.
[3056.44 --> 3062.66]  You fill me with joy in your presence with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
[3065.08 --> 3070.02]  You know, maybe speaking personally, maybe speaking for some of you as well,
[3070.60 --> 3073.70]  I think many of us may not think of God in this way.
[3074.92 --> 3075.16]  Right?
[3075.22 --> 3082.16]  We may think about God as being true, holy, right, good, right in everything he does.
[3082.64 --> 3084.62]  But, you know, maybe a little grumpy.
[3085.56 --> 3085.70]  Right?
[3085.74 --> 3088.96]  Maybe a little unwilling to bless us.
[3088.96 --> 3095.82]  And so then we view the Christian life as something more of a burden than as a joy and a delight.
[3095.82 --> 3099.64]  But that is not what God is like, friends.
[3099.92 --> 3100.04]  Right?
[3100.24 --> 3104.36]  David writes, in your presence, God, there is fullness of joy.
[3104.40 --> 3105.42]  Not just a little bit of joy.
[3105.96 --> 3106.84]  Fullness of joy.
[3107.04 --> 3108.62]  That fills you all the way up.
[3108.66 --> 3109.24]  Kind of joy.
[3110.02 --> 3110.18]  Right?
[3110.24 --> 3113.46]  At your right hand are pleasures forever.
[3113.46 --> 3117.98]  That's what it means to be in a relationship with God.
[3118.78 --> 3119.04]  Right?
[3119.12 --> 3122.96]  Not where, yeah, I believe he's true, but, you know, I don't know if he's willing to bless us.
[3122.96 --> 3126.46]  But actually, to just find joy and pleasure in God.
[3126.46 --> 3131.74]  That's what our relationship as Christians with God is to look like.
[3132.82 --> 3134.92]  Here's an example that I thought of.
[3135.24 --> 3139.58]  I know of someone who was single and who recently now has a boyfriend.
[3141.06 --> 3146.60]  Now, there are two different ways to describe talking about this event.
[3147.14 --> 3152.86]  On the one hand, you could say, objectively speaking, my status has changed.
[3153.26 --> 3154.72]  I am now in a relationship.
[3154.72 --> 3156.62]  You could say that.
[3156.88 --> 3157.60]  That's true.
[3158.22 --> 3164.20]  But another way of describing that very same event is a whole lot of butterflies in your stomach.
[3165.16 --> 3165.30]  Right?
[3165.56 --> 3166.16]  Excitement.
[3168.06 --> 3170.32]  A big smile on your face.
[3170.76 --> 3172.90]  You know, a lightness in your step.
[3173.66 --> 3173.98]  Joy.
[3175.56 --> 3181.10]  David is describing his walk with God here in this butterfly kind of way.
[3181.46 --> 3181.98]  Right?
[3181.98 --> 3186.72]  Where there's this experiential sense of gladness.
[3187.24 --> 3188.78]  Of walking with God.
[3188.88 --> 3190.10]  Of delighting in him.
[3190.72 --> 3194.66]  Of excitement because of the relationship you have with him.
[3194.66 --> 3195.96]  Not just my status has changed.
[3196.02 --> 3196.78]  I belong to God.
[3197.02 --> 3197.68]  That's true.
[3198.94 --> 3203.16]  But the smile that that relationship brings to your face.
[3205.06 --> 3208.66]  Friends, and not only that, this is something that we can experience right now.
[3208.66 --> 3208.84]  Right?
[3208.84 --> 3210.46]  This is not just a future reality.
[3210.46 --> 3211.90]  Like when we go to heaven one day.
[3211.90 --> 3217.24]  But this pleasure and joy in God we can experience right now today.
[3218.04 --> 3218.82]  Okay.
[3218.88 --> 3226.48]  So now as we close, what I want to do is invite us to imagine Jesus.
[3226.48 --> 3231.80]  Not only reading Psalm 16, but fulfilling Psalm 16.
[3234.02 --> 3241.42]  There was a time in real history when Jesus as a young boy would have sat in a Jewish synagogue
[3241.42 --> 3244.60]  and would have listened to Psalm 16.
[3244.60 --> 3255.10]  Not only would he have heard it read, he would have as a Jewish boy memorized it and prayed it and sang it.
[3255.10 --> 3262.32]  And you can imagine that for Jesus, Psalm 16, just, you know, in him, in his heart, right?
[3262.66 --> 3267.94]  The counsel of God, you know, in his heart, instructing him at night, all this stuff.
[3268.44 --> 3272.48]  And you can imagine for Jesus how whenever he faced anguish and hardship,
[3273.18 --> 3276.10]  he would look to God for refuge based on this psalm.
[3276.10 --> 3282.08]  Because he was going to live a life where God's protection, God being a refuge,
[3282.34 --> 3287.72]  was absolutely essential for his success as the Messiah.
[3289.46 --> 3293.96]  And then this confession, you are my Lord, apart from you I have no good thing.
[3294.16 --> 3298.50]  That would have been the basis for his walk with God on the earth.
[3299.48 --> 3301.28]  Lord, apart from you I have no good thing.
[3301.28 --> 3306.08]  And then think about what it was like for Jesus to pray and to sing,
[3306.50 --> 3310.60]  the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom I delight.
[3311.66 --> 3314.68]  Right? And Jesus was not ashamed to call us brothers.
[3315.50 --> 3318.50]  Sometimes we are ashamed to call people in the church brothers.
[3319.58 --> 3323.42]  Jesus was never ashamed to call you or me a brother.
[3325.32 --> 3327.74]  And so if anybody can say that, like,
[3327.74 --> 3330.90]  they are the noble ones in whom is my delight,
[3331.38 --> 3333.06]  it is Jesus who can say that.
[3333.90 --> 3337.12]  Because we are his bride, we are his body, we belong to him.
[3338.50 --> 3341.54]  And then you think about how Jesus always looked to God for counsel.
[3342.32 --> 3346.60]  And he walked so closely with God, doing his will.
[3347.82 --> 3349.22]  And it is Jesus who said,
[3349.52 --> 3352.44]  Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
[3353.00 --> 3356.62]  knowing that it was the will of the Lord to crush him.
[3356.62 --> 3361.44]  But he did so because he trusted in God's preservation.
[3362.42 --> 3367.48]  He could confront death because he knew ultimately God would preserve him.
[3368.10 --> 3370.04]  And that is the very thing that the apostle Paul,
[3370.64 --> 3374.28]  sorry, Peter, tells us in Acts chapter 2 that we read earlier.
[3374.76 --> 3374.90]  Right?
[3375.00 --> 3379.74]  When Peter, in his first sermon after the resurrection and the Holy Spirit's poured out,
[3380.04 --> 3381.62]  he preaches at Pentecost,
[3381.62 --> 3383.82]  he quotes this very psalm,
[3384.46 --> 3386.64]  and he applies it to Jesus,
[3387.08 --> 3389.28]  to his death and to his resurrection.
[3390.32 --> 3391.96]  So Jesus goes to the cross,
[3392.06 --> 3393.96]  he goes to bear our sins on the cross,
[3393.96 --> 3398.08]  and he does so knowing that God will preserve him through that.
[3399.42 --> 3401.24]  And so he trusts in God's promises
[3401.24 --> 3404.36]  that you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
[3404.68 --> 3407.52]  nor will you let your faithful one see decay.
[3407.52 --> 3413.58]  And friends, Jesus is the ultimate faithful one of Psalm 16.
[3414.70 --> 3418.02]  He knew that he would come marching out of the grave
[3418.02 --> 3420.52]  because God had made a promise to him.
[3421.52 --> 3423.82]  And this is how the apostles use that verse.
[3424.46 --> 3426.06]  Then Jesus goes to the grave,
[3426.34 --> 3427.26]  he goes to the cross,
[3427.32 --> 3430.30]  and he dies knowing that God will vindicate him.
[3431.24 --> 3434.38]  And then the very last words in verse 11,
[3434.38 --> 3436.38]  imagine Jesus singing,
[3436.76 --> 3439.18]  at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[3439.86 --> 3444.20]  And understanding that he is going to be at the right hand of God.
[3444.70 --> 3445.16]  Right?
[3445.20 --> 3446.24]  When after his resurrection,
[3446.42 --> 3448.48]  he ascends to the Father's right hand.
[3449.42 --> 3452.48]  And that, friends, is where our inheritance is.
[3453.38 --> 3453.88]  Right?
[3453.94 --> 3457.18]  Because the one who is at the right hand of God forever
[3457.18 --> 3460.12]  is our risen Lord Jesus Christ.
[3460.92 --> 3463.16]  And he, at the right hand of God,
[3463.52 --> 3465.68]  holds our lot secure.
[3467.88 --> 3470.78]  Surely we have a delightful inheritance.
[3471.84 --> 3472.78]  Let's pray together.
[3476.40 --> 3477.40]  Lord our God,
[3477.60 --> 3480.28]  we thank you for the inheritance
[3480.28 --> 3482.24]  that you have given us in Christ.
[3482.24 --> 3486.00]  Father, we are excited.
[3487.72 --> 3489.22]  We delight in you.
[3490.38 --> 3491.30]  We confess, though,
[3491.36 --> 3493.36]  that sometimes it's far easier for us
[3493.36 --> 3495.40]  to long for those things
[3495.40 --> 3497.72]  that will ultimately perish, spoil, and fade.
[3498.62 --> 3500.44]  And so we pray that you would give us faith
[3500.44 --> 3503.10]  to find true and full joy in your presence,
[3503.88 --> 3505.06]  living before God,
[3505.42 --> 3506.52]  taking refuge in him,
[3506.66 --> 3507.46]  delighting in him.
[3508.00 --> 3509.56]  We pray this for Jesus' sake.
[3510.00 --> 3510.24]  Amen.
[3510.24 --> 3510.30]  Amen.
[3512.24 --> 3513.64]  All right.
[3513.70 --> 3515.38]  So as the worship team comes up,
[3515.46 --> 3516.18]  let's all stand,
[3516.30 --> 3517.56]  and we'll get ready to sing
[3517.56 --> 3518.96]  our song of response.
[3518.96 --> 3519.16]  Amen.
[3542.24 --> 3547.46]  When I was here to walk with him,
[3547.46 --> 3552.56]  I was here to walk with him.
[3552.56 --> 3557.58]  Yet I looked for worldly treasure
[3557.58 --> 3562.34]  and forsake the king of kings.
[3562.88 --> 3567.82]  But find his hope in my Redeemer,
[3567.82 --> 3572.58]  O what hope in his love is sure,
[3573.04 --> 3577.96]  for Christ has made for every failing,
[3577.96 --> 3582.96]  I am this forevermore.
[3582.96 --> 3585.20]  life has made for all thousand times the Lord.
[3585.20 --> 3589.88]  Minor tears in times of sorrow,
[3589.88 --> 3595.44]  darkness not yet understood,
[3595.44 --> 3605.34]  Through the valley I must travel, where I see no earthly good.
[3605.82 --> 3615.20]  The light is peace that flows from heaven, and the strength intends on me.
[3615.20 --> 3625.08]  I know my pain will not be wasted, Christ completes His work in me.
[3625.44 --> 3637.70]  My Lord is here as a stranger, He'll bring on a narrow way.
[3637.70 --> 3647.30]  One with Christ I will encounter, Harming him, he's here for His name.
[3647.30 --> 3657.14]  But mine is armor for this battle, Struggling out to last the war.
[3657.52 --> 3666.30]  And the S.M. he will deliver, Safely to the golden shore.
[3666.30 --> 3676.30]  And mine are keys to Zion City, Where beside the King I walk.
[3677.30 --> 3686.30]  For there my heart has found its treasure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[3686.30 --> 3691.30]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[3691.30 --> 3697.30]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[3697.30 --> 3712.58]  Well, that song was quite fitting as a song of response.
[3712.58 --> 3724.10]  And so we will continue to worship the Lord by the giving of our tithes and offerings as a way to, you know, in a sense of what we said in Psalm 16,
[3724.10 --> 3732.38]  not hold too tightly to our treasures of this world, but to give our time, our talents, our treasures to God for the work of His kingdom.
[3732.38 --> 3738.06]  And so our designated offering for today is the Short-Term Mission Training Center.
[3738.72 --> 3744.76]  And this is an organization that has been working, even now, with Pastor Nancy doing evangelism training.
[3745.62 --> 3747.12]  And they've been going out.
[3747.18 --> 3754.12]  They have a team who have been kind of going out into Ladner, sharing, like, tracks on the street with people, having conversations.
[3754.12 --> 3764.42]  And Pastor Nancy has shared with us at the pastoral team about, you know, talking to all kinds of different people, old and young alike, about the gospel.
[3765.06 --> 3775.34]  And so while the deacons come and collect our offering, Nancy has prepared just a few slides that will be on the screen for you to kind of get a sense of what they do.
[3784.12 --> 3785.12]  Amen.
[3814.12 --> 3815.12]  Amen.
[3815.12 --> 3816.12]  Amen.
[3816.12 --> 3817.12]  Amen.
[3817.12 --> 3818.12]  Amen.
[3844.12 --> 3845.12]  Amen.
[3874.12 --> 3878.26]  Amen.
[3904.12 --> 3918.84]  So now also we will go to the Lord in a prayer of supplication
[3918.84 --> 3922.40]  as we pray for just our church family,
[3922.64 --> 3926.82]  some of the needs that we have, the needs of the world.
[3927.24 --> 3930.50]  And we will conclude by saying the Lord's prayer together.
[3930.86 --> 3932.36]  So let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[3932.36 --> 3941.32]  Father, again this morning, we thank you for the privilege of calling you our Heavenly Father.
[3942.12 --> 3946.32]  Thank you that you care deeply about each of your children.
[3947.10 --> 3949.42]  And you care about every need of your children.
[3950.10 --> 3951.86]  You care about what's on our hearts.
[3952.38 --> 3954.52]  You care about what's happening in our lives.
[3954.62 --> 3957.46]  You care about the path that we are walking on.
[3957.46 --> 3967.00]  You care by giving us your word, by bringing us into community with other believers as well.
[3967.86 --> 3970.82]  And you care for us by giving us your promises.
[3970.82 --> 3974.92]  Thank you that we have this confidence of your great care for us.
[3975.04 --> 3983.24]  And that we can delight in it because we know that we have this gift of who we are in Jesus.
[3983.60 --> 3985.78]  That we are united to him by faith.
[3986.48 --> 3988.66]  And that we can then take refuge in you.
[3989.78 --> 3992.06]  And that you hear our prayers and our supplications.
[3992.16 --> 3993.40]  You are not far from us.
[3993.40 --> 3995.18]  We don't need to scream and shout.
[3995.30 --> 3999.78]  But you are near to us because you have drawn us near to yourself.
[4001.54 --> 4006.10]  So Lord, we pray for Grace Koistra who was in the hospital for a few days this week.
[4006.68 --> 4011.86]  Lord, we pray that you would heal her in all the ways that she needs you.
[4012.80 --> 4015.92]  We thank you also that you brought Kukue home from the hospital.
[4016.78 --> 4020.74]  But Lord, you know that he has a long road of healing ahead of him.
[4020.74 --> 4024.32]  We pray for his upcoming surgeries to be successful.
[4025.64 --> 4029.52]  To correct all that was broken in his body from his accident.
[4030.56 --> 4034.26]  Lord, we pray for others in our congregation who are experiencing medical issues.
[4034.94 --> 4036.20]  Lord, would you be near to them.
[4036.38 --> 4042.18]  We pray for those who feel anxious about their life and things that are happening.
[4042.78 --> 4044.22]  We pray for those who grieve.
[4045.60 --> 4048.78]  Those who have died and gone to be with you.
[4048.78 --> 4050.26]  And those who maybe are sick.
[4050.98 --> 4053.24]  And Lord, there's so much grief that we have in this world.
[4053.92 --> 4061.40]  But Lord, as we've heard and we sung, we look forward to a future glory, a future kingdom.
[4062.00 --> 4066.40]  That not everything is about what we have in this world, Lord.
[4066.48 --> 4067.46]  But it's fleeting.
[4067.74 --> 4071.16]  And that you also will give us a greater inheritance.
[4071.16 --> 4074.02]  That will not only be for us in the future in heaven.
[4074.30 --> 4080.20]  But will continue in this earth as you renew all things and unite heaven and earth together.
[4080.54 --> 4081.78]  And dwell with us in your presence.
[4082.72 --> 4088.04]  Father, we ask that you would lead us in faithful love to you and to one another as a community.
[4088.22 --> 4091.56]  Lord, it's so hard sometimes to be part of a church.
[4091.56 --> 4094.60]  Where we don't always agree with one another.
[4095.30 --> 4096.86]  We irritate one another.
[4097.42 --> 4098.58]  Lord, we need humility.
[4098.90 --> 4099.74]  We need patience.
[4100.24 --> 4102.18]  And we need to see one another as a gift.
[4102.18 --> 4113.46]  So, Lord, would you help us to love one another and see one another as, Lord, those whom you love.
[4114.34 --> 4117.24]  Give us ears also, Lord, to listen well to your commands.
[4118.28 --> 4119.46]  Fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[4119.46 --> 4130.34]  And, Father, you are able to do far more abundantly in your world, in your church, and in each of our lives than all that we would ask or be able to even think or imagine.
[4131.10 --> 4136.88]  And, Lord, we pray all this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who taught us to pray, saying together.
[4137.70 --> 4141.50]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4141.92 --> 4146.02]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4146.02 --> 4154.14]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4154.46 --> 4158.16]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4158.74 --> 4163.46]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4164.04 --> 4164.38]  Amen.
[4165.54 --> 4173.56]  Let's stand and send you out with God's good word upon you, his good blessing.
[4173.56 --> 4182.24]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you now and forever.
[4182.78 --> 4183.04]  Amen.
[4184.12 --> 4188.60]  So, please remain standing, and we'll just go out with the doxology.
[4189.26 --> 4191.38]  It's called Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow.
[4191.38 --> 4191.44]  Amen.
[4191.44 --> 4191.50]  Amen.
[4191.50 --> 4193.50]  Amen.
[4193.50 --> 4195.50]  Amen.
[4195.50 --> 4197.50]  Amen.
[4197.50 --> 4199.50]  Amen.
[4199.50 --> 4201.50]  Amen.
[4201.50 --> 4202.50]  Amen.
[4202.50 --> 4203.50]  Amen.
[4203.50 --> 4203.54]  Amen.
[4203.56 --> 4233.54]  Amen.
[4233.56 --> 4263.54]  Amen.
[4263.56 --> 4293.54]  Amen.
