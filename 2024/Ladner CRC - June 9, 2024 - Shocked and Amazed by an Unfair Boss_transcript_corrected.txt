[512.98 → 515.44] to be called together by your holy word,
[515.68 → 519.74] to bring to you our prayers and our praises.

[526.30 → 528.68] and by your breath, all their hosts.
[529.50 → 531.32] You spoke, and it came to be.
[531.90 → 533.66] You commanded, and it stood firm.
[534.50 → 536.60] In your hands are the depths of the earth
[536.60 → 538.66] and the heights of the mountains,
[538.66 → 540.72] the sea and the dry land.
[541.58 → 545.32] We pray, Lord, that all the earth would fear you
[545.32 → 547.30] and stand in awe of you.
[547.98 → 550.42] And as we gather this morning to sing your praises,
[550.62 → 551.64] to hear your word,
[552.12 → 554.10] I pray that you would look in favour
[554.10 → 557.20] on those whose hope is in you.
[558.16 → 561.50] Would your Holy Spirit be mightily at work in and through us,
[562.20 → 563.56] this and every day?
[564.00 → 566.40] We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[567.02 → 567.38] Amen.
[567.38 → 567.50] Amen.
[568.66 → 572.98] Let's stand and hear God's greeting to us this morning.

[576.90 → 578.36] and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[579.02 → 581.76] So I invite you now to turn and greet those around you.

[853.46 → 857.84] There won't be bright moon сказала
[857.84 → 863.22] It's a very peaceful Gesetzentwurf
[863.22 → 867.74] Through themedimУθI was recovery
[867.74 → 877.74] Till the ground is changed and so, Till the other ground is in Christ's land.
[878.74 → 887.74] His oath, his covenant, his blood, So portly in the whelming flood,
[887.74 → 896.74] When all around us all gives grace, He then is all by hope and stay.
[897.74 → 906.74] On the west of the south and on the south, All other ground is sinking sand,
[906.74 → 912.74] All other ground is sinking sand.
[912.74 → 919.74] The day of the south and on the south, All other ground is sinking sand.
[919.74 → 932.74] The day of the south, All other ground is sinking sand.
[932.74 → 937.00] All flesh is sold in a question,
[937.42 → 941.54] all earth and children's trench are stoned,
[941.88 → 946.88] all the ground is seen by sand.
[949.62 → 951.36] Thank you. You may be seated.
[958.36 → 961.34] We enter into a time of confession,
[961.34 → 964.18] and assurance of pardon now.
[964.78 → 966.60] And we do this really to recognize,
[967.30 → 972.32] to see clearly who we are as fallen sinful creatures.
[973.16 → 976.82] You know, we constantly struggle to do what is good.
[977.48 → 979.78] Even when we look good on the outside,
[980.30 → 983.44] or do good deeds, still our hearts deceive us.
[984.12 → 988.64] And our inward thoughts do not always reflect godliness.
[988.64 → 994.08] And then sometimes these inner thoughts will lead to self-condemnation.
[995.12 → 998.04] But God desires that our struggles and our thoughts,
[998.18 → 1001.18] or in our words, or our actions,
[1002.30 → 1005.16] that he desires that they would lead us to Jesus.
[1006.56 → 1008.30] And so we come before him now,
[1008.68 → 1011.38] to confess the ways in which we have sinned,
[1011.72 → 1014.66] and not honoured God the way that he deserves.
[1014.66 → 1017.18] And because he loves us,
[1017.50 → 1019.66] he stands ready to forgive us,
[1019.98 → 1021.46] and to restore us to himself.
[1022.46 → 1024.74] So to guide our confession this morning,
[1025.14 → 1027.64] we're going to read Proverbs 3,
[1028.10 → 1029.54] there are two verses, five to six.
[1029.54 → 1032.56] And I'll read it,
[1032.60 → 1035.22] and then I would like to give you a moment
[1035.22 → 1036.32] to meditate,
[1036.62 → 1037.86] to silently reflect,
[1038.08 → 1042.98] and pray on using this as kind of what God's heart is for us,
[1043.34 → 1046.86] and then to consider the ways that we have not obeyed him and followed him.
[1047.60 → 1048.80] So let's,
[1048.94 → 1049.92] I'll read this for us.
[1049.92 → 1052.52] Trust in the Lord with all of your heart,
[1053.20 → 1055.06] and lean not on your own understanding.
[1055.76 → 1056.96] In all of your ways,
[1057.22 → 1057.88] submit to him,
[1058.32 → 1060.30] and he will make your paths straight.
[1061.46 → 1063.76] So take a moment of silent prayer and reflection.
[1063.76 → 1063.88] Thank you.
[1079.92 → 1090.88] Heavenly Father,
[1091.84 → 1096.34] you freely pardon all who repent and turn to you in faith.
[1097.14 → 1100.10] We thank you that your mercy is higher than the heavens,
[1101.02 → 1102.66] wider than our wanderings,
[1102.84 → 1104.02] deeper than all of our sin.
[1104.70 → 1108.94] We come to you through the perfect sacrifice of Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[1109.94 → 1112.52] Forgive our failure to trust you with all of our hearts,
[1112.96 → 1116.24] and our neglect of your wise and gracious commandments.
[1117.82 → 1118.42] O God,
[1118.48 → 1120.52] make us anew in the image of your Son,
[1120.74 → 1122.80] who died so that we might live.
[1123.84 → 1125.58] Help us to desire what is good,
[1126.04 → 1127.38] and to love what you love,
[1127.48 → 1129.56] and to do what you command,
[1129.82 → 1132.94] and to submit to you in all of our ways.
[1133.60 → 1135.88] And we pray through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1136.22 → 1136.58] Amen.
[1138.94 → 1141.82] So we have offered our confessions to God,
[1141.88 → 1143.14] and God is not silent.
[1143.42 → 1145.14] God, he answers us.
[1145.66 → 1147.40] And he answers us with the assurance
[1147.40 → 1150.74] that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1150.74 → 1153.86] is sufficient to cover all of our sins.
[1154.64 → 1156.44] And so here, these words of assurance
[1156.44 → 1158.54] from Romans chapter 8.
[1158.54 → 1161.82] There is now no condemnation
[1161.82 → 1164.20] for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[1164.90 → 1166.82] because through Christ Jesus,
[1167.30 → 1168.84] the law of the Spirit,
[1169.28 → 1170.16] who gives life,
[1170.44 → 1173.80] has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[1174.40 → 1175.44] Thanks be to God.
[1175.44 → 1178.30] So let's all stand again,
[1178.38 → 1180.34] and we will respond to God's love and mercy
[1180.34 → 1181.74] by singing our next song,
[1181.84 → 1182.92] His Mercy is More.
[1182.92 → 1199.06] What love could remember
[1199.06 → 1201.30] No wonder what else we have done
[1201.30 → 1203.94] A mission's all-knowing
[1203.94 → 1205.88] He counts not their sum
[1205.88 → 1208.28] Thrown into the sea
[1208.28 → 1211.68] Without bottom or shore
[1211.68 → 1214.18] For sins they are many
[1214.18 → 1217.06] His mercy is more
[1217.06 → 1226.20] What ancient crisis
[1226.20 → 1227.70] What ancient price
[1227.70 → 1228.20] Where do you love
[1228.20 → 1230.36] The Retain государ
[1230.36 → 1231.78] Why have mercy

[1241.78 → 1242.50] From what ancient

[1278.94 → 1282.20] His mercy is born
[1282.20 → 1287.26] What riches of kindness
[1287.26 → 1289.48] He lavished on us
[1289.48 → 1291.88] His blood was the payment
[1291.88 → 1294.12] His life was the cost
[1294.12 → 1296.42] We stood meek of debt
[1296.42 → 1299.92] We could never afford
[1299.92 → 1301.94] Our sins, the many
[1301.94 → 1305.06] His mercy is born
[1305.06 → 1307.32] Praise the Lord
[1307.32 → 1313.32] His mercy is born
[1313.32 → 1317.10] Strongly the judges
[1317.10 → 1319.32] New and more

[1321.06 → 1323.66] His mercy is born
[1323.66 → 1326.32] Praise the Lord
[1326.32 → 1328.58] His mercy is born
[1328.58 → 1330.58] His mercy is born
[1330.58 → 1334.58] Strongly the judges
[1334.58 → 1336.64] New and more
[1336.64 → 1338.36] Our sins, the many
[1338.36 → 1340.58] His mercy is born
[1340.58 → 1341.58] Our sins, the many
[1341.58 → 1342.58] His mercy is born
[1342.58 → 1345.58] Our sins, the many
[1345.58 → 1347.58] His mercy is born
[1347.58 → 1349.84] His mercy is born
[1349.84 → 1353.26] You may be seated
[1353.26 → 1361.52] Amen
[1361.52 → 1382.64] So brothers and sisters
[1382.64 → 1383.98] We come now to
[1383.98 → 1386.90] The table of our Lord
[1386.90 → 1387.82] Jesus Christ
[1387.82 → 1390.28] And at this table
[1390.28 → 1393.00] We see the one who came
[1393.00 → 1394.90] And laid down his life for us
[1394.90 → 1397.10] And he came, and he laid down
[1397.10 → 1398.80] His life so that we could
[1398.80 → 1400.64] Have life in him
[1400.64 → 1403.00] And the scriptures say that
[1403.00 → 1404.68] When we receive the bread
[1404.68 → 1406.14] And we receive the cup
[1406.14 → 1407.82] They are a means of grace
[1407.82 → 1409.76] Which means that the Holy Spirit
[1409.76 → 1410.82] Uses this meal
[1410.82 → 1411.80] In our lives
[1411.80 → 1413.84] To help us grow in faith
[1413.84 → 1415.20] To help us grow in trust
[1415.20 → 1417.36] In the power of the Holy Spirit
[1417.36 → 1418.96] But you know what friends
[1418.96 → 1419.98] This only happens
[1419.98 → 1422.72] This meal is only efficacious for us
[1422.72 → 1425.42] When we receive it by faith
[1425.42 → 1427.34] And so that is why
[1427.34 → 1429.72] If this is not your faith
[1429.72 → 1431.02] If you have not yet trusted
[1431.02 → 1432.56] Christ for salvation
[1432.56 → 1435.54] If you
[1435.54 → 1436.94] Sorry
[1436.94 → 1440.60] Some nice background music
[1440.60 → 1443.48] So if you have not yet trusted
[1443.48 → 1444.38] Christ for salvation
[1444.38 → 1445.76] And expressed that faith
[1445.76 → 1446.66] By being baptized
[1446.66 → 1447.90] In a local church
[1447.90 → 1449.14] Then you know
[1449.14 → 1449.88] We are so glad
[1449.88 → 1450.76] You are here
[1450.76 → 1452.06] And we invite you
[1452.06 → 1452.90] To use this time
[1452.90 → 1453.70] To consider
[1453.70 → 1456.08] Christ's invitation to you
[1456.08 → 1458.20] And to put your faith in him
[1458.20 → 1459.40] And to receive his life
[1459.40 → 1461.76] But we ask you not to take
[1461.76 → 1462.78] The elements at this time
[1462.78 → 1464.78] But if this is your faith
[1464.78 → 1466.90] Then Christ welcomes you
[1466.90 → 1468.54] To dine with him
[1468.54 → 1469.88] To feed on him
[1469.88 → 1471.32] At this table
[1471.32 → 1475.20] And so the Lord Jesus
[1475.20 → 1479.90] He said this
[1479.90 → 1481.90] On the night when he was betrayed
[1481.90 → 1483.38] He took bread
[1483.38 → 1485.24] And when he had given thanks
[1485.24 → 1485.92] He broke it
[1485.92 → 1486.38] And he said
[1486.38 → 1487.50] This is my body
[1487.50 → 1488.36] Which is for you
[1488.36 → 1489.58] Do this
[1489.58 → 1490.38] In remembrance
[1490.38 → 1491.40] Of me
[1491.40 → 1493.02] In the same way
[1493.02 → 1493.66] After supper
[1493.66 → 1494.66] He took the cup
[1494.66 → 1495.54] Saying this cup
[1495.54 → 1496.48] Is the new covenant
[1496.48 → 1498.04] In my blood
[1498.04 → 1499.52] Do this
[1499.52 → 1500.88] Whenever you drink it
[1500.88 → 1501.82] In remembrance
[1501.82 → 1502.60] Of me
[1502.60 → 1504.90] For as often

[1511.38 → 1512.86] He comes again
[1512.86 → 1515.20] And so

[1557.08 → 1558.46] To reconcile you
[1558.46 → 1559.12] With God

[1561.28 → 1562.28] Ask our elders
[1562.28 → 1563.22] To come forward
[1563.22 → 1564.02] And help me
[1564.02 → 1564.78] To serve the elements

[2037.50 → 2043.02] of your spirit at work within us and through us to love you to follow you and to serve you
[2043.02 → 2051.10] as your faithful followers we pray in Jesus name amen all right so now may I invite the children
[2051.10 → 2052.94] to come up front
[2052.94 → 2069.66] all right
[2069.66 → 2075.18] okay
[2075.18 → 2079.50] well I'm going to show you
[2082.94 → 2088.44] yeah there's some space on this side you want to come over here closer
[2088.44 → 2102.84] all right good morning how are you all today good all right so who likes to drink hot chocolate
[2102.84 → 2106.82] you do all does anybody not like to drink hot chocolate
[2106.82 → 2115.74] he likes it I can see it yeah so um you know it's good to drink hot chocolate in the winter when
[2115.74 → 2120.42] it's cold right because it kind of warms you up another time it's good to drink hot chocolate is
[2120.42 → 2124.48] when you're camping even in the summer because you kind of wake-up it's still kind of cold in the
[2124.48 → 2130.78] mornings right and uh you can drink some hot chocolate, and it warms you right up now I was
[2130.78 → 2135.98] thinking about hot chocolate this week because of this memory verse or not memory verse
[2135.98 → 2138.70] because this verse in scripture I'm going to read it to you
[2138.70 → 2144.98] it says I pray that out of his glorious riches that's God
[2144.98 → 2151.62] he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being where's your inner being
[2151.62 → 2159.22] kind of like here maybe is a spot in the body I don't know let's see okay so inner being so that
[2159.22 → 2168.48] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith Christ can live in our hearts, and then it says that you may
[2168.48 → 2174.24] be filled with a measure of the fullness of God so that's kind of sometimes hard to understand but
[2174.24 → 2183.02] what this is saying is that God by the Holy Spirit can come and live not only with us side by side but
[2183.02 → 2191.20] in us and actually when he lives in us, he fills up our whole lives is that interesting, so this is this
[2191.20 → 2198.72] is the connection here ready, so I have this nice little mug here it's not hot, but we're going to make some
[2198.72 → 2207.18] hot chocolate okay so cold chocolate you're right cold chocolate it still works though I think I don't
[2207.18 → 2217.72] know if it dissolves in cold water we will find out maybe more okay let's see you can if you'd like
[2217.72 → 2228.74] oh we're going to need to stir more okay, okay so what do you think does that look pretty good now
[2228.74 → 2238.16] yeah do you want to drink it like that no okay I think I wouldn't either but so this is you know this
[2238.16 → 2243.68] was I was thinking about this the Holy Spirit comes like this hot chocolate is like the Holy Spirit
[2243.68 → 2251.12] it comes into our lives, and it fills our entire lives that means every part of our lives is the
[2251.12 → 2255.68] Holy Spirit is working in us that means because when the Bible talks about our hearts it
[2255.68 → 2262.04] doesn't just mean this organ well you know the pumps it means our whole selves so our decisions
[2262.04 → 2269.82] that we make what we choose right or the things that we like the way we act toward other people
[2269.82 → 2276.16] all of this is about our hearts the Holy Spirit comes, and he fills our hearts, and he fills our
[2276.16 → 2284.44] whole lives so that everything we do is a reflection of who God is in our lives okay so that's what I
[2284.44 → 2288.90] wanted to share with you just like this hot chocolate so you know next time you drink some hot chocolate
[2288.90 → 2296.58] cold chocolate thank you again I want you to remember that the whole God fills our lives just like this
[2296.58 → 2305.68] it transforms us and so okay hope that makes sense okay all right let me pray for us
[2306.32 → 2311.16] yeah bow our head with our heads we'll fold our hands
[2311.16 → 2319.96] thank you, Lord that you have given us the gift of the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts to dwell with us
[2319.96 → 2326.16] to fill up our whole lives so that in every way we are your people and that we can live for you
[2326.16 → 2333.18] Lord would you help would you work powerfully in us so that we can believe in you and follow Jesus
[2333.18 → 2339.36] we pray in his holy name amen all right thanks for joining me see you later have a good class
[2339.78 → 2345.16] me
[2346.38 → 2348.60] oh
[2348.60 → 2378.58] Thank you.
[2378.60 → 2408.58] Thank you.
[2408.60 → 2410.60] Thank you.
[2438.60 → 2440.60] Thank you.
[2468.60 → 2470.60] Thank you.
[2470.60 → 2474.90] And we begin with these wonderful words.
[2500.60 → 2530.60] 
[2530.60 → 2560.60] 
[2560.60 → 2590.60] 
[2590.60 → 2591.26] The word of the Lord.
[2591.98 → 2593.06] Thanks be to God.
[2593.64 → 2595.46] Let us join our hearts in a moment of prayer.
[2595.88 → 2604.06] Oh God, our Father, although you are with us, we pray that as your word is proclaimed by a guest,
[2604.88 → 2614.00] that Lord, your word would be as kin to us, deeply known to us, that you would use, Lord, the proclamation of these things,
[2614.00 → 2620.82] so that we might be strengthened in our faith, that we might grow in holiness, that we might love one another,
[2620.82 → 2626.20] and that we might have the joy of thanksgiving in our hearts on account of your goodness to us.
[2626.24 → 2630.86] And so we pray all of this asking for your spirit to especially work in us through your word.
[2631.62 → 2634.46] At this time, for our good and for your glory.
[2634.74 → 2635.74] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2635.98 → 2636.30] Amen.
[2636.30 → 2636.42] Amen.
[2639.30 → 2646.36] Well, in a parable that was told around about the time that Jesus told this parable, within the Jewish community,
[2646.96 → 2651.90] the parable went, catch me if you hear what sounds a little bit different in this.
[2651.90 → 2656.68] A landowner hired workers for his vineyard, and when the time came for payment,
[2657.16 → 2662.02] he paid the one who worked two hours the same amount as the ones who had worked all day.
[2662.80 → 2669.00] Because the man who had worked for two hours had laboured so vigorously
[2669.00 → 2674.22] that he had accomplished as much in his two hours as the others did in their full day's labour.
[2675.56 → 2679.44] Now that is a parable that a Dutchman would write.
[2679.44 → 2682.50] That is a parable that some of my first employers would write.
[2682.72 → 2685.40] But that is not the parable that Jesus told us.
[2686.24 → 2688.12] And we do well to remember this.
[2689.00 → 2691.88] Because there's a story that we are expecting here,
[2691.92 → 2697.12] and it's the reason why as Jesus worked his way through Galilee and into Judea,
[2697.30 → 2699.26] he had to explain to more and more people,
[2699.66 → 2703.40] what is the kingdom like, and to whom does it belong?
[2704.30 → 2707.86] And it's a good question that we still need to be answering for ourselves.
[2707.86 → 2712.16] What is God's kingdom like, and actually, who does it belong to?
[2713.80 → 2717.50] Deep down, as we heard or made our own confession of sin,
[2717.54 → 2720.38] and then heard that word of the assurance of pardon,
[2720.66 → 2721.72] we have that confirmation,
[2722.28 → 2725.22] by God's good grace, it does belong to me.
[2725.28 → 2726.66] But then the question comes up,
[2726.86 → 2728.64] how do I know that I'm part of this kingdom,
[2728.78 → 2731.42] and what am I to be doing in this place?
[2731.42 → 2734.48] What is it defined by?
[2734.60 → 2738.96] What is the key character and quality of the kingdom of heaven?
[2740.12 → 2743.84] And the story that we are expecting as Jesus begins this parable,
[2744.24 → 2746.80] we could imagine ourselves sitting there in the audience,
[2747.16 → 2749.56] taking in this new story.
[2750.66 → 2754.42] By this point, Jesus was attracting more and more large audiences,
[2755.10 → 2756.00] because people were saying,
[2756.00 → 2757.56] you've got to hear him.
[2758.04 → 2759.40] You've got to see him.
[2759.62 → 2760.92] You've got to go touch him.
[2761.20 → 2763.36] He is either a miracle worker,
[2763.56 → 2764.32] or a wonder,
[2764.64 → 2766.06] or the son of God.
[2767.16 → 2769.54] And he's a teacher who teaches with such authority
[2769.54 → 2773.36] that even the religious leaders are up to plots
[2773.36 → 2774.34] and all sorts of other things,
[2774.40 → 2775.92] trying to figure out what to do with him.
[2777.08 → 2779.12] And the story that our hearts,
[2779.90 → 2783.14] the story that even a religious leader would expect,
[2783.50 → 2785.10] could look a lot like this.
[2785.10 → 2787.74] The kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house
[2787.74 → 2789.34] who went out early in the morning
[2789.34 → 2791.62] to hire labourers for his vineyard.
[2792.26 → 2795.42] He has a need that he can't supply himself,
[2795.72 → 2798.96] so he's going to go find a bunch of people to help him.
[2800.02 → 2801.80] And if the harvest comes off,
[2802.20 → 2805.12] ah, isn't it because of these amazing workers?
[2806.38 → 2808.26] Might even play a little bit with that.
[2808.82 → 2809.74] It's harvest time.
[2810.46 → 2812.30] This was very common in this era.
[2812.74 → 2814.52] Actually, when we lived in Southern California,
[2814.52 → 2816.66] this was still very common in the area
[2816.66 → 2817.64] that we lived in as well,
[2817.72 → 2820.80] where every day contractors would go over to the Home Depot.
[2821.24 → 2822.90] They would find day labourers to come
[2822.90 → 2824.20] and work on the project.
[2824.36 → 2825.98] And so if it was a really busy season,
[2826.20 → 2828.02] there would be very few people left over.
[2828.56 → 2829.60] If it was pretty slow,
[2830.08 → 2831.36] there would be lots of people
[2831.36 → 2834.26] just waiting for these types of jobs to pop up.
[2835.10 → 2837.20] We have a much more regulated work economy,
[2837.20 → 2839.70] but it still happens here in BC as well
[2839.70 → 2841.00] with farm labourers,
[2841.06 → 2843.76] with others that are on a daily basis picked up.
[2844.40 → 2847.58] And this would not have been a skilled bunch of labourers,
[2847.82 → 2852.12] but they were a crew of unskilled, landless.
[2852.66 → 2854.18] The folks that lived here would be,
[2854.46 → 2856.14] they didn't have land of their own,
[2856.20 → 2857.50] which is why they would have to gather
[2857.50 → 2858.78] in the central places
[2858.78 → 2860.82] and then go and work for those who had land.
[2861.44 → 2863.66] They tended to be poor and frequently homeless,
[2864.16 → 2865.26] men and boys.
[2865.26 → 2868.34] And so if we think of the story that we're expecting,
[2868.68 → 2870.64] all is quite normal so far.
[2871.20 → 2874.44] And after agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day,
[2874.98 → 2877.06] which we're told was about the equivalent
[2877.06 → 2878.80] of the daily pay of a worker
[2878.80 → 2881.48] and the daily pay of a soldier in that time
[2881.48 → 2885.68] was about $160 for a minimum wageworker in BC.
[2886.70 → 2889.18] If you would think 12 hours, 10 hours.
[2889.94 → 2892.32] But this man says, this is what I'll pay you.
[2892.90 → 2894.60] And evidently it was sufficient,
[2894.60 → 2896.64] quite suitable, a good amount,
[2897.14 → 2899.70] the amount that a farmer or a soldier would make.
[2899.98 → 2901.18] And so he sent them into the vineyard
[2901.18 → 2904.02] and still all is quite normal in this story.
[2905.10 → 2906.48] And as Jesus has said,
[2906.56 → 2908.68] the kingdom of heaven is like this.
[2909.06 → 2911.70] As listeners, we're sort of following along,
[2911.80 → 2912.50] but we're wondering,
[2913.30 → 2914.92] the disciples must have been wondering,
[2915.02 → 2916.34] where is he going with this?
[2916.34 → 2919.54] Jesus was addressing them in a story
[2919.54 → 2921.60] that they could comprehend quite clearly.
[2922.30 → 2924.22] And going out about the third hour,
[2924.34 → 2925.30] that is nine in the morning,
[2925.42 → 2928.24] he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
[2928.52 → 2929.46] And to them he said,
[2929.88 → 2931.22] you go into the vineyard too,
[2932.00 → 2933.44] and whatever is right,
[2934.44 → 2935.76] I will give you.
[2935.96 → 2936.58] So they went.
[2937.90 → 2939.28] Now this is interesting.
[2939.28 → 2941.84] Why did he need more workers?
[2942.96 → 2945.20] Was the harvest so abundant?
[2945.92 → 2948.24] Was the early returns on the first three hours of work
[2948.24 → 2949.84] so incredible that he realized,
[2950.34 → 2951.26] we need more help,
[2951.32 → 2952.16] we need more people?
[2954.00 → 2955.66] Or maybe those first workers
[2955.66 → 2958.92] not working as hard as they might have,
[2959.08 → 2960.52] and that's why he realizes,
[2960.74 → 2961.68] if this is going to get done,
[2961.74 → 2963.52] I'm going to need to bring in more people.
[2963.52 → 2965.22] Or maybe,
[2965.50 → 2967.44] had he miscalculated?
[2968.18 → 2969.60] Had he miscalculated?
[2970.92 → 2972.70] Was it possible,
[2973.46 → 2973.76] instead,
[2973.96 → 2974.88] that his interest was
[2974.88 → 2976.90] in bringing in more workers
[2976.90 → 2978.96] than perhaps he strictly needed?
[2980.66 → 2982.00] We thought of the master in that way,
[2982.06 → 2984.16] that he's actually lightening the load
[2984.16 → 2985.58] for these first workers
[2985.58 → 2987.58] by bringing in others to assist them,
[2987.82 → 2989.82] perhaps even if it was not necessary.
[2991.00 → 2992.12] Was it in addition,
[2992.12 → 2993.92] was the addition of more labourers
[2993.92 → 2995.38] going to make the burden lighter
[2995.38 → 2996.38] on those who had been hired
[2996.38 → 2997.44] at the crack of dawn?
[2998.38 → 2999.14] And what's more,
[2999.38 → 3001.44] he tells them that he will pay them what's right.
[3001.86 → 3002.92] With the first labourers,
[3002.96 → 3003.92] it was to be a denarius,
[3004.04 → 3006.54] and now it is intentionally left vague.
[3007.06 → 3008.52] But the question of the character,
[3008.70 → 3009.48] or the integrity,
[3009.88 → 3011.20] of the master is introduced.
[3012.80 → 3013.98] Going out again,
[3014.20 → 3016.20] about the sixth hour and the ninth hour,
[3016.40 → 3017.68] he did the same.
[3019.00 → 3019.42] Again?
[3019.42 → 3020.64] And then,
[3020.84 → 3021.92] about the eleventh hour,
[3022.02 → 3023.56] he went out and found others' den.
[3024.30 → 3025.18] And again,
[3025.30 → 3025.92] he goes out.
[3025.98 → 3027.48] We don't quite often think
[3027.48 → 3028.70] about the significance of this,
[3028.78 → 3030.26] but it's quite an interesting angle
[3030.26 → 3031.32] to the parable.
[3032.34 → 3033.02] This master
[3033.02 → 3034.86] has recalibrated
[3034.86 → 3035.66] the conditions
[3035.66 → 3037.50] of the workers in the vineyard
[3037.50 → 3038.54] four times,
[3038.66 → 3040.64] and now he's back once more
[3040.64 → 3042.18] at 5 p.m. approaches
[3042.18 → 3043.88] and quitting time nears.
[3043.88 → 3050.62] Is this kingdom economics?
[3052.34 → 3053.56] Is this master
[3053.56 → 3055.56] perhaps unwise?
[3056.44 → 3057.44] Is this master
[3057.44 → 3058.80] somehow even wasteful
[3058.80 → 3060.34] or extravagant?
[3062.10 → 3062.92] And remember,
[3063.08 → 3064.74] nagging in the back of our minds
[3064.74 → 3065.68] should be the question
[3065.68 → 3067.16] that the Pharisees asked,
[3067.26 → 3067.64] which was,
[3068.06 → 3069.38] why does this man,
[3069.48 → 3070.64] who's talking about the kingdom
[3070.64 → 3071.10] in this way,
[3071.36 → 3072.56] why does he
[3072.56 → 3073.74] waste his time
[3073.74 → 3075.04] with sinners
[3075.04 → 3076.94] and tax collectors?
[3078.18 → 3079.46] If he understands
[3079.46 → 3080.34] the significance
[3080.34 → 3081.54] of what he is claiming
[3081.54 → 3082.10] to be doing,
[3082.38 → 3083.52] bringing the kingdom of heaven
[3083.52 → 3084.46] into its fullness
[3084.46 → 3085.48] upon the earth,
[3086.02 → 3087.10] perhaps he's wrong
[3087.10 → 3088.32] about a lot of things,
[3089.00 → 3090.44] including how to run a vineyard.
[3092.04 → 3093.32] Get your labourers,
[3093.54 → 3094.48] start of the day,
[3094.76 → 3095.92] get as many as you want,
[3095.98 → 3096.60] as you need.
[3097.10 → 3098.32] I remember when I worked
[3098.32 → 3100.02] in landscaping for my boss
[3100.02 → 3100.60] who was an immigrant
[3100.60 → 3101.32] from the Netherlands,
[3101.74 → 3102.42] we would send
[3102.42 → 3103.88] a very small crew
[3103.88 → 3105.16] to go to a job
[3105.16 → 3106.14] and the instruction was,
[3106.38 → 3107.10] don't come back
[3107.10 → 3108.26] until it's done.
[3108.54 → 3109.38] And the reason we sent
[3109.38 → 3110.00] a small crew
[3110.00 → 3111.36] is we could send one truck.
[3111.66 → 3112.48] The reason we worked
[3112.48 → 3113.52] from 6 a.m.
[3113.60 → 3115.20] until sometimes 11
[3115.20 → 3116.68] or 12 o'clock at night
[3116.68 → 3117.86] before we finally turned around
[3117.86 → 3118.46] and went home
[3118.46 → 3119.64] is so we didn't have to make
[3119.64 → 3120.62] the trip the next day.
[3120.88 → 3122.12] The reason we all pushed
[3122.12 → 3123.46] so hard was because
[3123.46 → 3124.76] we wanted to get paid.
[3125.02 → 3125.84] We didn't get overtime,
[3125.84 → 3126.72] just hours,
[3127.02 → 3127.56] because I worked
[3127.56 → 3128.02] for an immigrant
[3128.02 → 3128.66] from the Netherlands.
[3129.06 → 3130.24] But in that context,
[3130.46 → 3131.82] we knew what it took,
[3132.06 → 3133.86] even I as a 16-year-old,
[3134.62 → 3135.88] to get the job done.
[3136.46 → 3137.74] And my boss knew
[3137.74 → 3139.20] I can send this crew,
[3139.36 → 3140.26] rely on them,
[3140.36 → 3141.44] and get the work done.
[3141.56 → 3142.38] And this guy
[3142.38 → 3143.74] is doing it entirely different.
[3144.66 → 3145.62] He's going out
[3145.62 → 3147.08] every couple of hours,
[3147.76 → 3148.88] gathering in more men,
[3149.40 → 3150.02] asking them,
[3150.22 → 3151.48] hey, I'm going to continue
[3151.48 → 3153.28] to help you.
[3153.34 → 3154.12] I'm going to continue
[3154.12 → 3155.04] to give you something
[3155.04 → 3155.80] for the day.
[3157.28 → 3158.78] He's hiring in the heat
[3158.78 → 3159.30] of the day.
[3159.52 → 3160.52] He's hiring in the middle
[3160.52 → 3161.48] of the day when it's hot.
[3161.56 → 3161.90] He says,
[3162.30 → 3163.04] come join the crew.
[3163.68 → 3164.74] Come assist in what
[3164.74 → 3165.78] is going on here.
[3168.22 → 3168.82] And again,
[3168.88 → 3170.44] that question of the tax collector,
[3170.52 → 3171.30] or of the Pharisees,
[3171.36 → 3172.98] was that this Jesus
[3172.98 → 3174.00] is talking in a way
[3174.00 → 3174.78] which it seems
[3174.78 → 3175.62] he just doesn't know
[3175.62 → 3176.30] what he's doing.
[3177.08 → 3177.76] He's hanging
[3177.76 → 3178.70] and spending out
[3178.70 → 3180.12] his time with sinners
[3180.12 → 3181.12] and tax collectors.
[3181.12 → 3182.84] He finds cause
[3182.84 → 3183.40] with people
[3183.40 → 3184.36] whom we
[3184.36 → 3186.04] know to have no value.
[3188.28 → 3189.28] And it's this set of heart
[3189.28 → 3189.84] in response
[3189.84 → 3190.70] to what this master
[3190.70 → 3191.16] is doing
[3191.16 → 3192.50] when he repeatedly
[3192.50 → 3193.38] brings people
[3193.38 → 3194.22] into his kingdom
[3194.22 → 3195.36] that reminds me
[3195.36 → 3196.48] of the great H.L. Mencken
[3196.48 → 3197.80] quote that Puritanism,
[3198.38 → 3199.10] which was a movement
[3199.10 → 3200.20] within the Church of England
[3200.20 → 3200.72] during the reign
[3200.72 → 3201.90] of Queen Elizabeth I,
[3202.40 → 3203.46] that Puritanism
[3203.46 → 3204.92] from which Reformed theology
[3204.92 → 3205.44] has emerged
[3205.44 → 3206.12] in a lot of ways
[3206.12 → 3207.48] and shares a lot with it,
[3207.82 → 3208.60] Puritanism
[3208.60 → 3209.68] is the haunting fear
[3209.68 → 3210.54] that someone
[3210.54 → 3211.52] somewhere
[3211.52 → 3212.44] may be happy.
[3214.96 → 3215.94] That conviction
[3215.94 → 3216.82] that somebody
[3216.82 → 3218.04] is being treated well
[3218.04 → 3219.48] even if they don't
[3219.48 → 3220.66] fully deserve it.
[3221.74 → 3223.04] And we can apply this
[3223.04 → 3224.76] as the older brother mindset
[3224.76 → 3225.90] of the parable
[3225.90 → 3226.74] of the two brothers
[3226.74 → 3227.58] that Jesus tells,
[3227.68 → 3228.52] the one that we call
[3228.52 → 3229.26] the parable
[3229.26 → 3230.12] of the prodigal son
[3230.12 → 3230.64] but is really
[3230.64 → 3233.28] of two very prodigal sons.
[3235.78 → 3237.00] Notice what the master says,
[3237.00 → 3238.20] why do you stand here
[3238.20 → 3239.26] idle all day?
[3239.70 → 3240.70] At this point,
[3240.84 → 3241.96] if this master
[3241.96 → 3242.52] has gone out
[3242.52 → 3243.48] numerous times
[3243.48 → 3244.54] and the audience
[3244.54 → 3245.24] is hearing it,
[3245.42 → 3246.28] they may be starting
[3246.28 → 3247.68] to question his judgment,
[3248.10 → 3250.18] questioning his kingdom economics,
[3250.36 → 3251.16] it's at this point
[3251.16 → 3251.82] that Jesus then
[3251.82 → 3252.60] makes it explicit.
[3252.76 → 3253.52] Why do you stand here
[3253.52 → 3254.22] idle all day?
[3254.52 → 3255.34] They said to him,
[3255.58 → 3256.44] because no one
[3256.44 → 3257.44] has hired us.
[3258.72 → 3259.66] Or you could paraphrase it,
[3259.74 → 3260.66] we're not worthy.
[3262.14 → 3263.00] He said to them,
[3263.08 → 3264.38] you go into the vineyard too.
[3265.54 → 3266.18] Wait, what?
[3267.00 → 3268.36] I wonder too,
[3268.48 → 3269.32] in the thinking
[3269.32 → 3270.08] through the story,
[3270.16 → 3271.40] has he recognized
[3271.40 → 3273.24] these men standing there
[3273.24 → 3274.26] all day?
[3275.26 → 3276.46] Did he see them there
[3276.46 → 3277.44] the whole time?
[3277.84 → 3279.06] Had they been in the group
[3279.06 → 3280.86] of those described
[3280.86 → 3281.78] in the third hour
[3281.78 → 3283.36] of whom the text says
[3283.36 → 3284.04] he saw others
[3284.04 → 3284.98] standing idle
[3284.98 → 3286.00] in the marketplace?
[3287.52 → 3288.36] I actually wonder,
[3288.92 → 3290.58] had they refused to come
[3290.58 → 3292.00] in their preference
[3292.00 → 3292.68] for idleness?
[3293.76 → 3294.48] Surely we know
[3294.48 → 3295.64] what that can be like.
[3295.64 → 3297.54] Were they day labourers
[3297.54 → 3298.06] who nonetheless
[3298.06 → 3298.90] were not likely
[3298.90 → 3299.52] to be hired?
[3299.96 → 3301.30] Maybe they had slept in,
[3301.38 → 3302.28] missed the normal time
[3302.28 → 3302.96] for such workers
[3302.96 → 3303.66] to be present
[3303.66 → 3304.82] and available.
[3305.26 → 3306.36] No one hired us,
[3306.40 → 3306.96] they respond.
[3308.34 → 3309.60] And he doesn't query them.
[3310.26 → 3310.82] He doesn't make
[3310.82 → 3311.76] a snide remark
[3311.76 → 3312.90] about there being a reason
[3312.90 → 3314.14] why you weren't hired today.
[3314.96 → 3315.96] He doesn't take the moment
[3315.96 → 3316.22] to say,
[3316.30 → 3317.34] well, let me set you straight,
[3317.48 → 3317.64] son.
[3317.94 → 3318.56] If you were here
[3318.56 → 3319.40] first thing in the morning,
[3319.52 → 3320.84] if you get rid of your beard,
[3320.92 → 3322.10] if you clean up a little bit,
[3322.32 → 3323.28] then you'll be hireable.
[3323.28 → 3324.20] I'll tell you what,
[3324.22 → 3325.66] I'll give you three days probation.
[3326.04 → 3327.08] You come back tomorrow.
[3327.40 → 3328.14] We'll get this started.
[3328.20 → 3328.50] No!
[3329.60 → 3330.10] He just says,
[3330.18 → 3330.56] come on.
[3331.34 → 3331.82] Come in.
[3332.42 → 3333.04] Join me.
[3334.94 → 3335.20] And so,
[3335.40 → 3336.32] either this harvest
[3336.32 → 3338.00] is so immense
[3338.00 → 3339.68] that as of
[3339.68 → 3340.88] the very end
[3340.88 → 3341.44] of the day,
[3341.54 → 3342.02] there's still
[3342.02 → 3342.64] the clear,
[3342.92 → 3343.32] evident
[3343.32 → 3345.60] need for more workers.
[3347.12 → 3348.16] Or the master
[3348.16 → 3349.62] is doing something else.
[3349.62 → 3352.18] And the gospel of God
[3352.18 → 3353.08] is that he is doing
[3353.08 → 3353.82] something else
[3353.82 → 3354.74] than what we expect.
[3355.66 → 3356.88] The gospel of God
[3356.88 → 3358.24] is that he is gathering
[3358.24 → 3359.52] a greater number
[3359.52 → 3360.68] that he might share
[3360.68 → 3361.50] his gladness
[3361.50 → 3362.54] and generosity
[3362.54 → 3363.18] with them.
[3363.36 → 3364.68] That's why he goes out
[3364.68 → 3365.78] again and again
[3365.78 → 3366.34] and again
[3366.34 → 3367.40] to fill up
[3367.40 → 3368.38] the kingdom of heaven.
[3368.70 → 3369.54] That's why he goes
[3369.54 → 3370.28] to those who say,
[3370.36 → 3370.44] well,
[3370.60 → 3371.84] we have not been hired
[3371.84 → 3373.12] or we are not worthy.
[3373.22 → 3373.54] And he says,
[3373.62 → 3374.18] come near.
[3374.76 → 3375.74] Come with me.
[3375.74 → 3377.76] Even before payment
[3377.76 → 3378.64] is given
[3378.64 → 3380.12] in the story,
[3380.42 → 3380.94] the master
[3380.94 → 3382.26] is acting generously.
[3382.98 → 3383.76] Even before
[3383.76 → 3384.42] the reckoning
[3384.42 → 3385.42] over their worth
[3385.42 → 3386.54] is taking place,
[3386.76 → 3387.48] he is acting
[3387.48 → 3388.22] with generosity.
[3388.42 → 3388.70] He's saying,
[3389.00 → 3389.56] I will do
[3389.56 → 3390.24] what is right
[3390.24 → 3391.02] for you.
[3392.66 → 3393.40] And this,
[3393.56 → 3394.06] Jesus says,
[3394.10 → 3394.62] is the way
[3394.62 → 3395.50] of the kingdom
[3395.50 → 3396.02] of heaven.
[3398.90 → 3399.72] A kingdom,
[3399.88 → 3400.26] he says,
[3400.32 → 3400.84] that belongs
[3400.84 → 3401.62] to the poor,
[3402.12 → 3402.82] the weak,
[3403.20 → 3403.78] the children,
[3404.42 → 3405.02] the widow,
[3405.02 → 3406.32] the orphan,
[3406.86 → 3407.84] the outcast,
[3408.44 → 3409.56] the tail end
[3409.56 → 3410.06] of the day
[3410.06 → 3410.92] types of people
[3410.92 → 3411.96] who can make
[3411.96 → 3412.60] no meaningful
[3412.60 → 3413.20] contribution
[3413.20 → 3414.02] to secure
[3414.02 → 3414.82] their place
[3414.82 → 3415.96] and their value
[3415.96 → 3416.50] in the kingdom.
[3418.58 → 3419.38] And then the
[3419.38 → 3420.76] parable turns.
[3420.88 → 3421.56] When evening came,
[3421.62 → 3422.36] the owner of the vineyard
[3422.36 → 3423.18] said to his foreman,
[3423.64 → 3424.50] call the labourers
[3424.50 → 3425.00] and pay them
[3425.00 → 3425.50] their wages
[3425.50 → 3426.56] beginning with the last
[3426.56 → 3427.88] up to the first.
[3428.64 → 3429.26] And when those
[3429.26 → 3429.82] hired about the
[3429.82 → 3430.76] eleventh hour came,
[3430.86 → 3431.28] each of them
[3431.28 → 3432.34] received a denarius.
[3433.50 → 3433.90] And it said
[3433.90 → 3434.48] at the outset
[3434.48 → 3435.24] that the story
[3435.24 → 3436.02] here was still
[3436.02 → 3437.18] unfolding in a way
[3437.18 → 3438.10] that many assume
[3438.10 → 3439.14] mercy and generosity
[3439.14 → 3440.16] has nothing to do
[3440.16 → 3440.90] with what's happening
[3440.90 → 3441.26] here.
[3442.00 → 3443.18] The story we expect
[3443.18 → 3444.14] to hear is one
[3444.14 → 3444.88] that is all about
[3444.88 → 3445.68] verse 8,
[3446.36 → 3447.48] but then completely
[3447.48 → 3448.40] confounded by
[3448.40 → 3449.42] verses 9 through 10.
[3452.84 → 3453.86] Very understandable
[3453.86 → 3454.50] verse 8,
[3455.62 → 3456.56] very befuddling
[3456.56 → 3457.58] verses 9 through 10.
[3458.82 → 3459.44] And the glory,
[3459.56 → 3459.94] the mystery,
[3460.04 → 3460.96] the wonder of the gospel
[3460.96 → 3461.66] is all in those
[3461.66 → 3462.22] latter verses,
[3462.22 → 3462.76] isn't it?
[3463.76 → 3464.90] The last to arrive
[3464.90 → 3465.46] in the vineyard
[3465.46 → 3465.94] were paid
[3465.94 → 3466.50] what the master
[3466.50 → 3467.04] of the harvest
[3467.04 → 3468.52] joyfully decides
[3468.52 → 3469.14] to pour out
[3469.14 → 3469.76] on those who had
[3469.76 → 3470.22] joined him.
[3470.58 → 3471.66] The harvest is in,
[3471.84 → 3472.60] the heat of the day
[3472.60 → 3473.22] has passed,
[3473.58 → 3474.66] the burden of labouring
[3474.66 → 3475.34] in the vineyard
[3475.34 → 3476.06] has been brought
[3476.06 → 3476.86] to a close,
[3477.44 → 3478.82] and the generous
[3478.82 → 3479.82] master provides
[3479.82 → 3480.52] an excessive
[3480.52 → 3481.42] compensation
[3481.42 → 3482.92] to those labourers
[3482.92 → 3484.24] who barely had time
[3484.24 → 3485.04] to break a sweat
[3485.04 → 3486.30] before they received
[3486.30 → 3487.08] their checks.
[3487.94 → 3489.14] No one had hired them,
[3489.36 → 3490.16] they were not worthy
[3490.16 → 3490.76] to be hired
[3490.76 → 3491.46] by the world's
[3491.46 → 3491.96] estimations,
[3492.24 → 3492.76] and yet he says,
[3492.84 → 3493.32] here you go,
[3494.14 → 3494.88] your full pay.
[3496.40 → 3497.38] Now when those
[3497.38 → 3498.62] hired first came,
[3499.22 → 3499.72] they thought
[3499.72 → 3500.32] they would receive
[3500.32 → 3500.56] more,
[3500.64 → 3501.16] but each of them
[3501.16 → 3501.76] also received
[3501.76 → 3502.22] denarius.
[3503.12 → 3503.86] And they would have
[3503.86 → 3505.72] seen and heard
[3505.72 → 3507.44] the shock and delight
[3507.44 → 3508.02] on the faces
[3508.02 → 3508.98] of the late arriving
[3508.98 → 3510.32] servants when they
[3510.32 → 3511.16] arrived with their
[3511.16 → 3511.76] coins of payment.
[3512.08 → 3513.54] Can you believe it?
[3513.76 → 3514.70] Hey, look, look,
[3514.72 → 3515.52] did you get it too?
[3516.62 → 3518.54] That true visceral joy
[3518.54 → 3519.60] of receiving something
[3519.60 → 3520.78] you have not deserved
[3520.78 → 3522.46] and yet been amazed
[3522.46 → 3523.06] to receive.
[3524.70 → 3525.24] And those who had
[3525.24 → 3525.92] worked all day
[3525.92 → 3528.32] are hearing this,
[3528.40 → 3528.96] seeing this,
[3529.06 → 3530.84] and in their circumstances,
[3531.04 → 3531.76] what's so interesting
[3531.76 → 3532.60] here is that they
[3532.60 → 3533.26] will actually,
[3533.44 → 3534.28] by receiving the
[3534.28 → 3534.80] denarius,
[3535.12 → 3536.38] lose nothing.
[3537.24 → 3537.94] It isn't that it
[3537.94 → 3538.66] comes at their
[3538.66 → 3539.26] expense.
[3539.48 → 3540.30] It isn't that it
[3540.30 → 3541.54] comes because they
[3541.54 → 3542.34] get less.
[3543.14 → 3544.24] They lose nothing
[3544.24 → 3545.34] in this exchange.
[3546.24 → 3547.14] But they're raised
[3547.14 → 3549.78] expectations after
[3549.78 → 3550.44] seeing what the
[3550.44 → 3552.04] lesser labourers got.
[3553.54 → 3554.22] This is why it's
[3554.22 → 3555.20] critical to remember
[3555.20 → 3557.34] that the shock
[3557.34 → 3558.28] of mercy
[3558.28 → 3560.44] follows and flows
[3560.44 → 3561.28] from the satisfaction
[3561.28 → 3563.00] of justice.
[3564.30 → 3565.42] God always
[3565.42 → 3566.32] satisfies his
[3566.32 → 3566.90] justice,
[3567.36 → 3568.30] which is what
[3568.30 → 3569.44] makes his mercy
[3569.44 → 3570.64] even grander
[3570.64 → 3571.88] and more amazing.
[3572.42 → 3573.24] As D.A. Carson
[3573.24 → 3573.48] wrote,
[3573.58 → 3574.78] justice is served
[3574.78 → 3575.08] here.
[3575.78 → 3576.42] He did what he
[3576.42 → 3577.42] said he would do,
[3577.70 → 3579.16] but mercy is added.
[3579.68 → 3580.62] Justice is served,
[3580.72 → 3582.12] but mercy is added.
[3583.36 → 3584.38] And on receiving it,
[3584.46 → 3585.08] what did they do?
[3585.14 → 3586.04] They grumbled at
[3586.04 → 3586.70] the master of the
[3586.70 → 3587.12] house, saying,
[3587.44 → 3588.22] these last worked
[3588.22 → 3589.00] only one hour.
[3589.30 → 3589.80] You've made them
[3589.80 → 3590.38] equal to us,
[3590.40 → 3591.00] who have borne the
[3591.00 → 3591.68] burden of the day
[3591.68 → 3592.34] and the scorching
[3592.34 → 3592.64] heat.
[3593.14 → 3594.34] They leave the foreman
[3594.34 → 3594.86] in the huff.
[3595.06 → 3595.96] They march up to
[3595.96 → 3596.46] the master.
[3596.56 → 3597.40] It's a shocking
[3597.40 → 3597.92] scene.
[3598.52 → 3599.38] Jesus' hearers would
[3599.38 → 3600.22] be shocked by the
[3600.22 → 3601.76] impudence and the
[3601.76 → 3602.56] complaint that these
[3602.56 → 3603.36] men bring to the
[3603.36 → 3604.12] master of the vineyard.
[3604.12 → 3605.46] And then,
[3605.82 → 3606.14] Jesus,
[3606.44 → 3607.14] lest the disciples
[3607.14 → 3607.94] miss the point,
[3608.44 → 3608.86] Jesus says,
[3608.94 → 3610.00] let me remind you
[3610.00 → 3610.64] of the declaration
[3610.64 → 3611.38] you heard at the
[3611.38 → 3612.28] end of the 19th
[3612.28 → 3612.54] chapter,
[3612.64 → 3613.54] or before it was
[3613.54 → 3614.14] written down just
[3614.14 → 3614.84] as I was talking
[3614.84 → 3615.52] to you before.
[3616.28 → 3617.94] So the last will
[3617.94 → 3619.16] be first and the
[3619.16 → 3620.14] first last.
[3620.40 → 3621.24] This is the way of
[3621.24 → 3621.80] the kingdom of
[3621.80 → 3621.98] heaven.
[3622.32 → 3623.06] This is what it
[3623.06 → 3624.00] looks like for a
[3624.00 → 3624.66] master to say,
[3624.90 → 3625.56] let's bring more.
[3625.88 → 3626.72] Let's have more
[3626.72 → 3627.28] come in.
[3627.56 → 3628.28] And some to say,
[3628.36 → 3629.14] I want nothing to
[3629.14 → 3630.38] do with such mercy,
[3630.78 → 3631.58] nothing to do with
[3631.58 → 3632.44] such generosity.
[3632.44 → 3634.38] For all shall
[3634.38 → 3635.26] receive in accordance
[3635.26 → 3636.02] with the master's
[3636.02 → 3636.84] desire for them.
[3638.16 → 3639.10] So dear Christian,
[3640.04 → 3640.92] remember that the
[3640.92 → 3641.76] shock of mercy
[3641.76 → 3642.80] follows and flows
[3642.80 → 3643.58] from the satisfaction
[3643.58 → 3644.36] of justice,
[3644.78 → 3645.94] but that we should
[3645.94 → 3647.78] never cut ourselves
[3647.78 → 3648.70] off from the
[3648.70 → 3650.02] shock of mercy.
[3650.24 → 3651.14] I titled this
[3651.14 → 3651.36] sermon,
[3651.46 → 3652.08] To Be Shocked
[3652.08 → 3652.58] and Amazed
[3652.58 → 3653.82] by an Unfair
[3653.82 → 3654.40] Boss.
[3654.96 → 3655.50] That some people
[3655.50 → 3655.78] say, well,
[3655.82 → 3656.48] God's not unfair.
[3656.58 → 3657.06] I said, no,
[3657.18 → 3657.68] praise God,
[3657.76 → 3658.40] he isn't.
[3658.40 → 3660.56] But he does act
[3660.56 → 3662.64] in ways that cause
[3662.64 → 3663.52] us to sit up
[3663.52 → 3664.90] and wonder that
[3664.90 → 3666.34] God, my God,
[3666.38 → 3667.18] should have mercy
[3667.18 → 3668.16] on me.
[3668.48 → 3670.56] Hired, I'll ask
[3670.56 → 3671.16] you, what hour
[3671.16 → 3671.88] were you hired?
[3672.84 → 3674.40] What hour or
[3674.40 → 3676.06] how much work,
[3676.44 → 3677.22] how much of the
[3677.22 → 3677.90] things have you
[3677.90 → 3679.00] done in your
[3679.00 → 3681.40] life to make
[3681.40 → 3682.14] it so that God
[3682.14 → 3683.88] has to give you
[3683.88 → 3684.56] a full pay?
[3684.56 → 3686.44] Or do you
[3686.44 → 3687.46] realize and see
[3687.46 → 3689.80] just in whom
[3689.80 → 3690.46] you are
[3690.46 → 3692.24] that he has
[3692.24 → 3693.08] in his mercy
[3693.08 → 3693.80] come and found
[3693.80 → 3694.90] you at the
[3694.90 → 3695.50] right hour,
[3696.00 → 3697.00] at the right
[3697.00 → 3697.44] time?
[3698.34 → 3699.00] And you also
[3699.00 → 3699.76] see in your own
[3699.76 → 3700.60] heart at times
[3700.60 → 3701.64] that willingness
[3701.64 → 3702.82] to go there
[3702.82 → 3703.28] where those
[3703.28 → 3703.88] first servants
[3703.88 → 3704.16] went.
[3704.88 → 3705.14] And do we
[3705.14 → 3705.60] cut ourselves
[3705.60 → 3706.24] off from that
[3706.24 → 3706.56] and say, I
[3706.56 → 3706.96] would much
[3706.96 → 3707.84] rather just
[3707.84 → 3708.54] surrender to
[3708.54 → 3709.30] the mercy of
[3709.30 → 3709.70] the Lord
[3709.70 → 3710.68] than to demand
[3710.68 → 3711.26] what is my
[3711.26 → 3711.64] right?
[3711.64 → 3714.80] But it is
[3714.80 → 3715.90] to see the
[3715.90 → 3716.56] shock of
[3716.56 → 3717.12] mercy, the
[3717.12 → 3718.16] surge of
[3718.16 → 3719.00] delight, the
[3719.00 → 3719.70] sense of
[3719.70 → 3720.44] receiving from
[3720.44 → 3721.12] the hand of
[3721.12 → 3721.60] a foreman
[3721.60 → 3722.52] something that
[3722.52 → 3723.48] you felt I
[3723.48 → 3724.12] had no right
[3724.12 → 3724.68] to and that
[3724.68 → 3725.10] is what the
[3725.10 → 3725.56] Lord says, you
[3725.56 → 3726.06] have the right
[3726.06 → 3726.56] to the kingdom
[3726.56 → 3727.16] of heaven.
[3727.64 → 3728.22] That is what
[3728.22 → 3728.78] is given to
[3728.78 → 3728.94] you.
[3729.22 → 3729.72] That is what
[3729.72 → 3730.20] is granted
[3730.20 → 3730.72] to you.
[3734.00 → 3734.80] Because Jesus
[3734.80 → 3735.70] continues in
[3735.70 → 3736.26] the parable
[3736.26 → 3738.38] in verse 13,
[3738.48 → 3739.16] he says to
[3739.16 → 3739.68] one of them,
[3740.02 → 3741.62] friend, I am
[3741.62 → 3742.38] doing you no
[3742.38 → 3742.82] wrong.
[3743.52 → 3744.04] Did you not
[3744.04 → 3744.80] agree with me
[3744.80 → 3745.52] for a denarius?
[3745.86 → 3746.24] Take what
[3746.24 → 3746.82] belongs to you
[3746.82 → 3747.52] and go, I
[3747.52 → 3748.44] choose to give
[3748.44 → 3749.00] to this last
[3749.00 → 3749.70] worker as I
[3749.70 → 3750.18] give to you.
[3750.38 → 3750.82] Am I not
[3750.82 → 3751.48] allowed to do
[3751.48 → 3752.14] what I choose
[3752.14 → 3752.52] with what
[3752.52 → 3753.08] belongs to
[3753.08 → 3753.26] me?
[3753.42 → 3753.96] Or do you
[3753.96 → 3754.60] begrudge my
[3754.60 → 3755.14] generosity?
[3756.26 → 3756.74] And in that
[3756.74 → 3757.32] one word
[3757.32 → 3758.60] address, friend,
[3759.40 → 3759.74] when it's
[3759.74 → 3760.30] there as a
[3760.30 → 3760.84] singular, we
[3760.84 → 3761.22] should sit
[3761.22 → 3761.64] up and take
[3761.64 → 3762.66] notice, Jesus
[3762.66 → 3763.48] uses the same
[3763.48 → 3764.18] word two other
[3764.18 → 3764.80] times in the
[3764.80 → 3765.12] Greek.
[3765.70 → 3766.18] Once to
[3766.18 → 3767.06] address Judas
[3767.06 → 3768.20] on the night
[3768.20 → 3768.94] he was betrayed
[3768.94 → 3770.02] and the other
[3770.02 → 3770.70] to address the
[3770.70 → 3771.46] man in the
[3771.46 → 3771.98] parable of the
[3771.98 → 3772.44] wedding feast
[3772.44 → 3773.08] who refused
[3773.08 → 3773.50] the wedding
[3773.50 → 3774.32] garments given
[3774.32 → 3774.76] to him,
[3775.08 → 3775.66] preferring his
[3775.66 → 3776.16] own guard.
[3777.36 → 3778.06] You who have
[3778.06 → 3779.02] turned down my
[3779.02 → 3780.52] generosity, go.
[3782.16 → 3783.10] Judas, go.
[3783.72 → 3785.22] You who have
[3785.22 → 3786.22] pridefully rejected
[3786.22 → 3787.00] the wedding
[3787.00 → 3787.76] garments richly
[3787.76 → 3788.60] provided to you,
[3788.96 → 3789.18] go.
[3790.46 → 3791.62] Friend, take
[3791.62 → 3792.32] your coin and
[3792.32 → 3792.56] go.
[3794.04 → 3794.72] It really
[3794.72 → 3795.42] echoes the rich
[3795.42 → 3796.06] young ruler's
[3796.06 → 3797.56] tragic action of
[3797.56 → 3798.46] departing from the
[3798.46 → 3799.38] Messiah's presence
[3799.38 → 3800.16] without believing
[3800.16 → 3800.84] and laying down
[3800.84 → 3801.62] all things for
[3801.62 → 3802.06] the Lord of
[3802.06 → 3802.40] glory.
[3803.54 → 3804.00] The master of
[3804.00 → 3804.58] the vineyard gives
[3804.58 → 3805.28] the instruction of
[3805.28 → 3806.68] judgment against the
[3806.68 → 3807.54] ungrateful labourers,
[3807.60 → 3808.46] take what belongs to
[3808.46 → 3808.92] you and go.
[3810.50 → 3811.26] Depart from my
[3811.26 → 3811.96] presence for you
[3811.96 → 3813.48] will not share in
[3813.48 → 3815.60] my generosity and
[3815.60 → 3816.66] the joy of our
[3816.66 → 3817.32] celebration.
[3819.20 → 3819.88] For after all,
[3820.62 → 3821.64] the remainder of
[3821.64 → 3822.58] the men, as was
[3822.58 → 3823.46] custom, would have
[3823.46 → 3825.32] stayed that evening
[3825.32 → 3827.22] to eat a meal,
[3828.06 → 3828.42] and if the
[3828.42 → 3829.06] harvest had gone
[3829.06 → 3829.98] well, to enjoy
[3829.98 → 3830.90] some of the
[3830.90 → 3831.68] festivities, to
[3831.68 → 3832.82] enjoy that sense
[3832.82 → 3834.38] of delight, that
[3834.38 → 3835.10] the work had been
[3835.10 → 3835.88] completed for the
[3835.88 → 3836.78] day, and that they
[3836.78 → 3837.48] could enjoy some
[3837.48 → 3838.28] wine with the rest
[3838.28 → 3838.84] of the household
[3838.84 → 3839.76] before eventually
[3839.76 → 3840.64] finding their ways
[3840.64 → 3841.04] home.
[3842.34 → 3842.94] But the one who
[3842.94 → 3843.90] sought to deny the
[3843.90 → 3844.74] generosity of the
[3844.74 → 3846.44] master, Jesus says,
[3846.52 → 3846.98] go now.
[3847.08 → 3848.02] There's no place at
[3848.02 → 3848.76] the table for you
[3848.76 → 3849.28] any longer.
[3850.96 → 3851.62] And this morning,
[3851.86 → 3852.68] I think this portion
[3852.68 → 3853.40] of the text can
[3853.40 → 3854.54] really convict us.
[3855.32 → 3855.90] And I lay before
[3855.90 → 3856.58] you the counsel
[3856.58 → 3857.20] of scripture.
[3858.00 → 3858.86] To any who worry
[3858.86 → 3859.52] that you've become
[3859.52 → 3860.54] complacent or lack
[3860.54 → 3861.70] joy in the grace
[3861.70 → 3863.66] shown to you, as
[3863.66 → 3865.28] you remain amazed,
[3866.08 → 3867.00] you won't be one
[3867.00 → 3867.68] of those who turn
[3867.68 → 3867.98] away.
[3868.60 → 3869.98] As you remain amazed,
[3870.14 → 3870.88] you won't be one
[3870.88 → 3872.16] of those who turns
[3872.16 → 3872.70] away.
[3873.90 → 3876.04] To delight in God's
[3876.04 → 3877.22] grace to you and
[3877.22 → 3878.16] God's grace to
[3878.16 → 3879.22] others, grace to
[3879.22 → 3880.24] others being just as
[3880.24 → 3881.20] sweet to you as the
[3881.20 → 3882.24] grace he has shown
[3882.24 → 3882.82] to you.
[3882.82 → 3884.98] Do you begrudge
[3884.98 → 3885.90] the generosity of
[3885.90 → 3886.26] the Lord?
[3887.36 → 3888.32] Are you Peter asking
[3888.32 → 3889.34] how generous you must
[3889.34 → 3890.04] be to your brother
[3890.04 → 3890.82] who has sinned
[3890.82 → 3891.48] against you?
[3892.12 → 3894.08] Or are you Peter's
[3894.08 → 3895.48] brother needing to be
[3895.48 → 3896.04] forgiven with
[3896.04 → 3896.74] regularity?
[3898.06 → 3898.84] For grace to be
[3898.84 → 3899.72] gracious and must be
[3899.72 → 3900.70] understood to be
[3900.70 → 3902.14] generous and freely
[3902.14 → 3903.00] given so that we
[3903.00 → 3903.78] might be moved to
[3903.78 → 3904.24] praise.
[3905.60 → 3906.72] That's why we must
[3906.72 → 3908.28] hope for an unfair
[3908.28 → 3908.76] boss.
[3908.76 → 3910.76] And what's more,
[3911.12 → 3912.10] we are those when
[3912.10 → 3912.94] we are called into
[3912.94 → 3913.72] the Lord's presence,
[3913.80 → 3914.46] into his kingdom,
[3915.30 → 3916.10] that at the end of
[3916.10 → 3917.46] the day celebrate the
[3917.46 → 3918.08] feast together.
[3918.30 → 3919.20] At the end of the
[3919.20 → 3920.34] day are not those who
[3920.34 → 3921.26] wander away saying I
[3921.26 → 3922.06] want nothing to do
[3922.06 → 3923.00] with this, but instead
[3923.00 → 3924.44] become those who find
[3924.44 → 3925.90] our place at a table
[3925.90 → 3927.38] far greater than
[3927.38 → 3927.86] this.
[3928.76 → 3930.46] This is an echo, a
[3930.46 → 3932.06] mere foreshadowing of
[3932.06 → 3933.04] the greatness that we
[3933.04 → 3933.80] will enjoy.
[3934.02 → 3935.02] The splendour of
[3935.02 → 3935.92] sitting down with the
[3935.92 → 3937.06] master of the vineyard,
[3937.06 → 3938.52] enjoying all the fruits
[3938.52 → 3939.18] of the kingdom of
[3939.18 → 3939.40] heaven.
[3939.64 → 3940.74] And that is what the
[3940.74 → 3941.62] Lord says I give to
[3941.62 → 3942.56] you even if you come
[3942.56 → 3944.50] in by this time at the
[3944.50 → 3945.52] very last hour.
[3950.32 → 3951.80] Love how the scriptures
[3951.80 → 3952.64] remind us in Hebrews
[3952.64 → 3953.32] chapter 9.
[3954.44 → 3955.32] Christ having been
[3955.32 → 3956.46] offered once to bear
[3956.46 → 3957.88] the sins of many will
[3957.88 → 3959.76] appear a second time not
[3959.76 → 3961.12] to deal with sin but to
[3961.12 → 3961.96] save those who are
[3961.96 → 3963.72] eagerly waiting for him.
[3963.72 → 3966.78] to give to you not just
[3966.78 → 3969.32] a denarius but the keys
[3969.32 → 3969.98] to the kingdom of
[3969.98 → 3971.26] heaven, to the throne
[3971.26 → 3972.54] room of God.
[3974.70 → 3976.10] What hour did you start?
[3977.52 → 3977.92] You know what?
[3977.94 → 3980.80] It matters less than where
[3980.80 → 3983.00] the Lord calls you as you
[3983.00 → 3985.02] conclude, as you finish, as
[3985.02 → 3987.24] you wrap up life and all
[3987.24 → 3988.74] of its callings, all of its
[3988.74 → 3989.94] labours, all the things
[3989.94 → 3991.58] that you were given in the
[3991.58 → 3994.08] while being amazed in God's
[3994.08 → 3995.68] mercy by being shocked
[3995.68 → 3998.46] with his goodness and being
[3998.46 → 3999.66] entered into his, being
[3999.66 → 4000.96] welcomed into his presence.
[4001.84 → 4002.58] And so let us pray.
[4002.96 → 4004.02] Oh God our Father in heaven,
[4004.10 → 4006.00] we rejoice that out of the
[4006.00 → 4008.40] fullness of your storehouses,
[4008.58 → 4012.08] your treasure trove, you
[4012.08 → 4013.50] have been so delighted to
[4013.50 → 4016.96] give not only your Son to us
[4016.96 → 4019.62] but your Spirit to us and
[4019.62 → 4022.00] your Word to us and your
[4022.00 → 4023.26] church to us.
[4024.00 → 4025.02] And we pray, oh God, that
[4025.02 → 4025.80] you would continue to
[4025.80 → 4027.62] minister to us in our need.
[4028.62 → 4029.46] Help us, Lord, to fight
[4029.46 → 4032.38] against any spiritual pride so
[4032.38 → 4033.96] that we might find
[4033.96 → 4037.22] satisfaction in knowing that
[4037.22 → 4039.84] we are here by your grace,
[4040.72 → 4042.66] Lord, to receive your mercy.
[4043.72 → 4045.14] And therefore we call upon you,
[4045.14 → 4046.52] Lord, to strengthen our faith,
[4046.96 → 4049.36] to give us that joy, and to
[4049.36 → 4050.22] show us, Lord, your way.
[4050.30 → 4051.42] We pray this all in Jesus' name.
[4051.64 → 4051.90] Amen.
[4062.58 → 4064.14] Let's stand together and sing
[4064.92 → 4067.12] Come Thou Fount of every blessing.
[4075.14 → 4083.70] Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
[4084.14 → 4087.96] tune my heart to send thy grace,
[4087.96 → 4092.58] streams of mercy never ceasing,
[4093.02 → 4097.00] call for songs of loudest praise.
[4097.52 → 4101.50] Teach me some melodious sonnet,
[4101.50 → 4105.50] sung by flaming tongues above.
[4105.50 → 4110.50] Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it,
[4110.88 → 4115.10] mount of God's redeeming love.
[4117.70 → 4121.82] Here I raise my Ebenezer,
[4122.32 → 4125.50] hither by thy help I've come,
[4125.50 → 4130.58] And I hope I've had the pleasure
[4130.58 → 4134.82] safely to arrive at home.
[4135.50 → 4139.44] Jesus sought me when a stranger
[4139.44 → 4143.94] wandering from the fold of God.
[4143.94 → 4148.38] He to rescue me from danger
[4148.38 → 4152.88] interposed his precious blood.
[4152.88 → 4160.00] O to grace, how great a debtor
[4160.00 → 4163.88] daily I'm constrained to be.
[4163.88 → 4169.06] Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter
[4169.06 → 4172.88] bind my heart to thee.
[4174.04 → 4178.10] Pro to water, Lord, I feel it.
[4178.46 → 4181.88] Pro to wake above my love.
[4182.88 → 4187.14] Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it.
[4187.54 → 4191.14] Seal it for thy courts above.
[4193.00 → 4194.42] May we see it.
[4194.42 → 4195.42] Amen.
[4204.86 → 4207.22] So we'll continue to worship the Lord
[4207.22 → 4209.30] with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4209.76 → 4212.64] And our offerings, whether it's in song
[4212.64 → 4215.58] or in prayer or in money or in time
[4215.58 → 4219.68] or in talents, they are all our joyful response
[4219.68 → 4221.62] to the goodness of God.
[4221.62 → 4224.40] And so our designated offering for today
[4224.40 → 4226.92] is for ABBA Canada, as you can see there.
[4226.92 → 4228.84] And they work with families
[4228.84 → 4230.08] who are adopting children.
[4231.02 → 4232.58] And so may I invite the deacons
[4232.58 → 4234.24] to come and collect the morning offering.
[4234.24 → 4239.24] and like any kind of worship the Lord
[4243.68 → 4246.68] and any wellness of all of us
[4246.68 → 4246.98] and our offerings as you seek God
[4246.98 → 4247.90] and any heal here
[4247.90 → 4250.04] and gently carry out all the activities
[4250.04 → 4250.64] that we're looking for while we are
[4250.64 → 4251.00] in prayer.
[4251.00 → 4251.92] We are all our worshippers
[4251.92 → 4252.48] and days of time for this
[4252.48 → 4253.32] and our hope is there will be
[4253.32 → 4253.90] calling through the gifts of the invitation
[4253.90 → 4255.22] and let them know
[4255.22 → 4255.76] for this evening.
[4255.76 → 4256.76] Amen.
[4285.76 → 4286.76] Amen.
[4315.76 → 4316.76] Amen.
[4345.76 → 4346.76] Amen.
[4346.76 → 4347.76] Amen.
[4347.76 → 4348.76] Amen.
[4348.76 → 4349.76] Amen.
[4349.76 → 4350.76] Amen.
[4350.76 → 4351.76] Amen.
[4351.76 → 4352.76] Amen.
[4352.76 → 4353.76] Amen.
[4353.76 → 4354.76] Amen.
[4354.76 → 4355.76] Amen.
[4355.76 → 4356.76] Amen.
[4356.76 → 4357.76] Amen.
[4357.76 → 4358.76] Amen.
[4358.76 → 4359.76] Amen.
[4359.76 → 4360.76] Amen.
[4360.76 → 4361.76] Amen.
[4361.76 → 4362.76] Amen.
[4362.76 → 4363.76] Amen.
[4363.76 → 4364.76] Amen.
[4364.76 → 4365.76] Amen.
[4365.76 → 4367.76] Let's go to the Lord in prayer together.
[4367.76 → 4368.76] Please join me.
[4370.76 → 4375.74] O loving Father, we come to you this morning, a world of love, and a world of love, and a world
[4375.74 → 4384.48] of our guilt, and yet also comforted and rejoicing in your provision in Christ Jesus to forgive
[4384.48 → 4388.74] us and to give us your righteousness.
[4388.74 → 4395.74] Father, we thank you for the message we heard this morning that you are the Lord of the vineyard,
[4395.74 → 4396.74] Lord, and you are so gracious.
[4396.74 → 4397.74] You are generous.
[4397.74 → 4405.56] And so whenever we have been brought into your kingdom, Lord, we pray that we would receive
[4405.56 → 4412.56] it with the joy that comes with being hired even though we are unworthy.
[4412.56 → 4421.56] And Lord, would you help us to extend that invitation to others to join the Lord of the harvest, to come into his
[4421.56 → 4424.56] good kingdom, and to receive his mercy as well.
[4424.56 → 4431.56] Lord, we pray for those who are the Lord of the harvest, and it is because of him, and because
[4431.56 → 4434.56] you sent Jesus to be our great high priest, Lord, that we draw near to you with confidence
[4434.56 → 4439.56] to your throne of grace to receive mercy and help in time of need.
[4439.56 → 4445.56] And we do bring many needs to you this morning, whether they are spoken or unspoken.
[4445.56 → 4452.56] Lord, we pray for those, Lord, as you command us, those whom you have set in authority over
[4452.56 → 4453.56] us.
[4453.56 → 4458.56] We pray for our prime minister, for our provincial and local leaders, for our legislators and
[4458.56 → 4460.56] our judges.
[4460.56 → 4461.56] Would you give them wisdom?
[4461.56 → 4463.56] Would you give them righteousness?
[4463.56 → 4468.56] Would you give them joy that there might be justice in our land and flourishing for our
[4468.56 → 4469.56] people?
[4469.56 → 4476.56] Lord, we thank you for the work that you have called Norman to with strong towns.
[4476.56 → 4483.56] And Lord, whatever initiative you have given him, would you strengthen his hands to do the
[4483.56 → 4488.56] work that you have called him to do and provide all that he is in need of as well.
[4488.56 → 4493.56] We thank you, Lord, for the work of your church by the power of your spirit.
[4493.56 → 4497.56] And Lord, we pray for your blessing upon your church, our local church here.
[4497.56 → 4501.56] Your churches in Delta and around the world.
[4501.56 → 4508.56] We especially ask, Lord, for your blessing on the CRC Synod beginning to convene this coming
[4508.56 → 4509.56] Friday.
[4509.56 → 4510.56] Would you bless our denomination?
[4510.56 → 4515.56] Would you make us faithful and fruitful for your gospel?
[4515.56 → 4520.56] And Lord, as your gospel goes out, we do pray that by the power of your spirit, that
[4520.56 → 4526.56] many in this city of Ladder and in this province that do not know you and do not call upon you
[4526.56 → 4532.56] by faith that they would, that you would grant them repentance and leading to a knowledge
[4532.56 → 4534.56] of the truth.
[4534.56 → 4537.56] Lord, we lift the knees of our congregation.
[4537.56 → 4543.56] We pray for all those who face poverty, sickness, suffering or death.
[4543.56 → 4547.56] Would you restore health and give strength in all things?
[4547.56 → 4555.56] Fill those who need, Lord, your touch with health.
[4555.56 → 4559.56] And Lord, would you give them also comfort, the comfort of your gospel?
[4559.56 → 4565.56] And Lord, we especially pray for your mercy and strength for George, who is facing another
[4565.56 → 4567.56] battle with his lungs.
[4567.56 → 4570.56] Lord, would you show him your mercy?
[4570.56 → 4574.56] Be with his wife and for his extended family, Lord.
[4574.56 → 4579.56] And would you be present with them, Lord, with your strength and your mercy?
[4579.56 → 4586.56] Lord, we, as we experience our weakness, as we experience the fruit of sin in this world,
[4586.56 → 4592.56] and as we experience the suffering, the toil of the fallen world, we do pray, Lord, that
[4592.56 → 4596.56] Christ would come soon to make all things right.
[4596.56 → 4601.56] And we ask this in the name, in his name, the name of our Lord Jesus, who taught us to
[4601.56 → 4604.56] pray, saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4604.56 → 4609.56] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4609.56 → 4614.56] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4614.56 → 4621.56] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass
[4621.56 → 4622.56] against us.
[4622.56 → 4626.56] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4626.56 → 4632.56] For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever.
[4632.56 → 4633.56] Amen.
[4634.56 → 4640.56] Let's stand, and we'll go out with God's good word upon us.
[4640.56 → 4644.56] And we invite you to join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall through the
[4644.56 → 4645.56] doors there.
[4645.56 → 4649.56] So would you extend your hands and receive this word of blessing.
[4649.56 → 4652.56] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4652.56 → 4655.56] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4655.56 → 4658.56] The Lord lift his face upon you and give you peace.
[4658.56 → 4659.56] Amen.
