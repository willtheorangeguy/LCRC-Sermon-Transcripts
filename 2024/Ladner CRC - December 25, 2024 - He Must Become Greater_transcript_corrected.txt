[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.

[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[270.00 → 299.98] Thank you.
[300.00 → 329.98] Thank you.
[330.00 → 359.98] Thank you.
[360.00 → 362.00] Thank you.
[362.00 → 389.98] Thank you.
[389.98 → 419.96] Thank you.
[419.98 → 421.98] Thank you.
[449.98 → 451.98] Thank you.
[479.98 → 481.98] Thank you.
[509.98 → 511.98] Thank you.
[511.98 → 513.98] Thank you.
[513.98 → 515.98] Thank you.
[515.98 → 517.98] Thank you.
[517.98 → 547.96] Good morning.
[547.96 → 549.96] And Merry Christmas.
[549.96 → 551.96] To all of you.
[551.96 → 553.96] We're gathering with us.
[553.96 → 555.96] To worship the Lord.
[555.96 → 557.96] And the day of Christmas morning.
[585.96 → 587.96] And not yet.
[587.96 → 592.66] We're still waiting for his return when he will come to renew all things.
[594.78 → 597.34] And so however you are feeling this morning,
[597.64 → 601.06] whether you're excited by the festivities of the holidays,
[601.36 → 605.40] or whether you're feeling more discouraged or downcast,
[605.98 → 608.22] hear these words from the Lord Jesus.
[609.68 → 614.48] Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[614.98 → 617.40] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me.
[617.96 → 623.18] For I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[624.66 → 627.02] Friends, our God is a God of compassion.
[627.42 → 633.44] He is tender, he is full of mercy, and he sees us, and he draws near to us
[633.44 → 635.48] because he is Emmanuel.
[636.06 → 637.16] He is God with us.
[638.14 → 643.26] So as we begin our time of worship this morning, we remember that Christ has come.
[643.26 → 651.50] And we do that by lighting, finally, the white candle of our Advent wreath, the Christ candle.
[652.48 → 658.00] And so I will invite Emma and Gabby to come up and lead us in the candle lighting.
[658.00 → 677.00] And the world became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,
[677.38 → 681.98] glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[681.98 → 687.64] Joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[687.64 → 693.00] We light this candle because Jesus, the light of the world, was born among us.
[693.32 → 698.00] The light of the glory will shine forever, and will scatter all the darkness away.
[698.34 → 699.88] Joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[699.88 → 729.86] Joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[730.54 → 731.58] Very well done.
[732.74 → 738.30] All right, would you please join me in a prayer of adoration as we come before God to worship him?
[738.80 → 746.94] Our Father in heaven, creator of all things, we praise you for creating us in your love and for your love.
[747.82 → 750.96] We praise you because you are full of mercy and compassion.
[751.62 → 753.74] You have not treated us as our sins deserve.
[753.74 → 761.48] We have run from you to pursue our own ends, and we often continue to run from you.
[761.48 → 771.26] But as the shepherd goes after the lost sheep, so you have pursued us by sending your Son to redeem us.
[771.92 → 778.90] Lord Jesus, thank you for leaving the splendour and the riches of heaven to become poor for us,
[778.90 → 789.56] to take on our weakness, our shame, our sin, that we might be made new through you, through your life, death, and your resurrection.
[789.56 → 796.70] Holy Spirit, the author and giver of life, would you attend our praises and our prayers this morning.
[797.30 → 802.36] And we ask that you would help us to fix our eyes on our Saviour Jesus Christ this day,
[802.36 → 805.46] that we might praise you in spirit and in truth.
[806.36 → 812.88] Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, to you belongs all praise and honour and glory now and forever.
[813.46 → 813.86] Amen.
[814.54 → 820.92] Let's all stand and hear God's greeting to us this morning from the Gospel of John, chapter 1.
[821.92 → 826.96] In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
[826.96 → 832.54] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[833.12 → 838.10] Let's turn and let's greet one another, saying, of course, Merry Christmas.
[838.32 → 838.92] Blessed Christmas.
[838.92 → 839.06] Merry Christmas.
[839.06 → 840.06] Merry Christmas.
[856.96 → 876.90] Merry Christmas.
[876.90 → 878.16] Merry Christmas.
[878.16 → 904.94] Angels from the grounds of glory
[904.94 → 909.56] Bring your flag for all the earth
[909.56 → 914.34] You who said creation story
[914.34 → 919.02] Now proclaim the Messiah's birth
[919.02 → 924.08] Come and worship, come and worship
[924.08 → 929.36] Worship Christ the newborn King
[929.36 → 935.94] Shepherds in the field abiding
[935.94 → 941.06] Watching o'er your flocks by night
[941.06 → 946.30] God with eyes is now residing
[946.30 → 951.32] Yonder shines the infant light
[951.32 → 956.36] Come and worship, come and worship
[956.36 → 963.36] Worship, worship Christ the newborn King
[963.36 → 969.36] Stitches leave your contemplations
[969.36 → 974.26] Brighter visions be not far
[974.26 → 979.36] Seek the great desire, O nation
[979.36 → 984.36] You have seen His beautiful star
[984.36 → 989.36] Come and worship, come and worship
[989.36 → 995.36] Worship Christ the newborn King
[995.36 → 1002.36] Thou and if we now reveal Him
[1002.36 → 1007.36] We shall heal His authors' crown
[1007.36 → 1012.36] Gather all the nations
[1012.36 → 1014.36] Gather all the nations
[1014.36 → 1015.36] Gather all the nations
[1015.36 → 1016.36] Gather all the nations
[1016.36 → 1017.36] Gather all the nations
[1017.36 → 1018.36] How many nations
[1018.36 → 1019.36] Dear them, every nation
[1019.36 → 1020.36] Coal the moon!
[1020.36 → 1021.36] Shout them bow down
[1021.36 → 1022.36] Come and worship, come and worship
[1022.36 → 1023.36] Worship, come and worship
[1023.36 → 1028.36] Worship Christ the newborn King
[1028.36 → 1030.36] King.
[1032.46 → 1034.70] All creation
[1034.70 → 1036.66] joined and
[1036.66 → 1038.60] raising on
[1038.60 → 1039.98] the Father,
[1040.44 → 1042.68] Spirit, Son.
[1043.18 → 1044.24] Ever
[1044.24 → 1046.80] are your voices
[1046.80 → 1048.84] raising to
[1048.84 → 1050.34] the eternal
[1050.34 → 1052.98] three in one.
[1053.50 → 1054.76] God in
[1054.76 → 1057.02] worship, God
[1057.02 → 1058.08] in worship,
[1058.96 → 1060.06] worship,
[1060.48 → 1062.38] the Lamb,
[1062.38 → 1064.42] what year.
[1064.42 → 1093.64] Let Christian friends rejoice
[1093.64 → 1097.10] with heart and soul and might.
[1097.54 → 1100.66] He leads to what we say.
[1101.08 → 1104.16] Jesus Christ was born today.
[1104.16 → 1107.94] Often as before and now,
[1108.04 → 1111.54] He is in the manger now.
[1111.92 → 1114.16] Christ is born today.
[1115.30 → 1118.04] Christ is born today.
[1119.80 → 1122.86] Christian friends rejoice
[1122.86 → 1126.32] with heart and soul and might.
[1127.28 → 1130.60] Now He here of endless bliss.
[1130.60 → 1134.12] Jesus Christ was born for this.
[1134.44 → 1137.72] He has opened heaven's door.
[1138.20 → 1141.52] We are blessed forevermore.
[1141.94 → 1144.60] Christ was born for this.
[1145.44 → 1148.50] Christ is born for this.
[1148.50 → 1151.96] Christ is born to save.
[1151.96 → 1153.96] Christ is born to save.
[1153.96 → 1159.42] Christ is born to save.
[1159.42 → 1163.42] Christ is born to save.
[1163.42 → 1165.22] Christ is born to save.
[1165.22 → 1174.68] Christ is born to save.
[1174.68 → 1179.26] Christ is born to save.
[1179.26 → 1188.72] Christ is born to save.
[1188.72 → 1190.36] You may be seated.
[1190.36 → 1192.38] Christ is born to save.
[1195.84 → 1197.00] So our scripture reading
[1197.00 → 1201.00] as we hear the birth story
[1201.00 → 1201.92] of our Lord Jesus
[1201.92 → 1203.52] comes from Luke chapter 2.
[1203.92 → 1205.12] It will be up on the screen.
[1205.26 → 1206.72] I also invite you to open your Bibles
[1206.72 → 1207.98] if you'd like to follow along there.
[1207.98 → 1219.86] so Luke chapter 2 that is on page 762 in your pew bible 762, and I'll read Luke chapter 2 verses 1
[1219.86 → 1221.02] through 14
[1221.02 → 1229.96] in those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire
[1229.96 → 1236.06] Roman world this was the first census that took place while Quirinus was governor of Syria
[1236.06 → 1244.22] and everyone went to his own town to register, so Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth
[1244.22 → 1251.92] in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem the town of David because he belonged to the house and line of David
[1251.92 → 1259.68] he went there to register with Mary who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child
[1259.68 → 1267.58] while they were there the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn a son
[1267.58 → 1273.54] she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
[1273.54 → 1279.70] and there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night
[1279.70 → 1286.24] an angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified
[1286.24 → 1295.08] but the angel said to them do not be afraid I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the
[1295.08 → 1304.82] people today in the town of David a saviour has been born to you, he is Christ the Lord this will be
[1304.82 → 1314.34] assigned to you, you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger suddenly a great company
[1314.34 → 1322.44] of the heavenly host appeared with the angel praising God and saying glory to God in the highest
[1322.44 → 1329.48] and on earth peace to men on whom his favour rests this is the word of the Lord
[1329.48 → 1334.36] let's stand and let's continue to sing some carols together
[1334.36 → 1352.68] sing some carols together
[1352.68 → 1356.68] sing some carols together
[1356.68 → 1360.68] sing some carols together
[1360.68 → 1390.66] sing some carols together
[1390.66 → 1419.62] sing some carols together
[1419.62 → 1424.80] To you can be displayed
[1424.80 → 1429.90] While still the mountains falling close
[1429.90 → 1434.62] And in a major lake
[1434.62 → 1439.62] On some of the angels suddenly
[1440.36 → 1444.62] The clear, the shining throne
[1444.62 → 1448.62] Of angels praising God
[1448.62 → 1454.56] Whose death are dressed and he artful sun
[1454.56 → 1459.84] All glory be to God, O God
[1459.84 → 1464.50] And to the earth be pleased
[1464.50 → 1469.38] To those who open his way to rest
[1469.38 → 1474.92] Good men shall never cease
[1474.92 → 1490.14] For this next song, which is very familiar
[1490.14 → 1492.70] We do not have the first verse on the screen
[1492.70 → 1494.72] But you know it, so please sing it with us
[1494.72 → 1497.18] And of course the other two verses as well
[1497.18 → 1512.40] The way in a major lake
[1512.40 → 1523.62] The way in a major
[1523.62 → 1527.92] No grip for a pain
[1527.92 → 1531.78] The gift of Lord Jesus
[1531.78 → 1535.40] Lays down his sweet head
[1535.40 → 1539.56] The stars in those lights
[1539.56 → 1543.34] Dying down where he lay
[1543.34 → 1547.50] The little Lord Jesus
[1547.50 → 1551.34] Asleep on the hay
[1551.34 → 1557.28] The cattle are growing
[1557.28 → 1561.44] In the baby of faith
[1561.44 → 1565.22] The little Lord Jesus
[1565.22 → 1568.50] O crying in the hay
[1568.50 → 1572.66] I love you, Lord Jesus
[1572.66 → 1576.44] Look down from the sky
[1576.44 → 1579.72] And stay from my silent
[1579.72 → 1583.72] Till morning is thine
[1583.72 → 1589.44] Be near me, Lord Jesus
[1589.44 → 1592.94] As I ask you to stay
[1592.94 → 1596.60] Close by me forever
[1596.60 → 1600.38] And love me, Lord Jesus
[1600.38 → 1604.16] Lays all the dear children
[1604.16 → 1607.92] In your tender care
[1607.92 → 1611.86] Prepare us for heaven
[1611.86 → 1616.16] To live with you there
[1616.16 → 1639.34] So this last month
[1639.34 → 1642.30] As a church, we have been on a
[1642.30 → 1643.22] Kind of like a journey
[1643.22 → 1645.98] And it's a journey through the darkest days
[1645.98 → 1646.50] Of the year
[1646.50 → 1648.70] When the days are shortest
[1648.70 → 1650.88] The nights are longest
[1650.88 → 1653.48] Through the season of Advent
[1653.48 → 1656.52] And our guide on this journey
[1656.52 → 1657.84] Has been John the Baptist
[1657.84 → 1660.58] And we've been looking at his life
[1660.58 → 1663.28] We've been looking at who he is
[1663.28 → 1666.34] What he was preparing the way for
[1666.34 → 1669.48] And then how his voice cries out
[1669.48 → 1672.30] For all people to know and to love
[1672.30 → 1673.36] The Lord Jesus Christ
[1673.36 → 1679.28] And friends, his voice still rings out today
[1679.28 → 1683.94] He calls us to love and to trust
[1683.94 → 1685.12] Our Lord Jesus
[1685.12 → 1687.34] And so on this Christmas morning
[1687.34 → 1690.48] I want us to look at another key passage
[1690.48 → 1692.78] In the life of John the Baptist
[1692.78 → 1695.86] And today we will be in the Gospel of John
[1695.86 → 1699.24] And actually we will not have the Scripture
[1699.24 → 1700.70] On the screen now
[1700.70 → 1702.44] So I do encourage you
[1702.44 → 1704.38] To open your pew Bible
[1704.38 → 1705.54] And join me
[1705.54 → 1708.00] In following along in the text
[1708.00 → 1710.38] So that will be John chapter 3
[1710.38 → 1713.04] And that is on page
[1713.04 → 1715.20] 791
[1715.20 → 1717.44] 791
[1717.44 → 1722.58] And so a quick note
[1722.58 → 1725.58] John, the author of John's Gospel
[1725.58 → 1726.58] That we're reading from
[1726.58 → 1728.28] Is different from John the Baptist
[1728.28 → 1729.00] Right?
[1729.08 → 1731.98] The author John is Jesus' friend
[1731.98 → 1733.16] His beloved disciple
[1733.16 → 1736.38] And we will read a bit of what he writes
[1736.38 → 1737.62] About John the Baptist
[1737.62 → 1739.22] Okay?
[1739.32 → 1741.58] So we will read John chapter 3
[1741.58 → 1743.82] Verses 25 to 30
[1743.82 → 1745.50] And let's give our attention
[1745.50 → 1746.78] To the reading of God's Word
[1746.78 → 1748.90] Which is absolutely true
[1748.90 → 1750.76] And he gives it to us
[1750.76 → 1751.90] Because he loves us
[1751.90 → 1759.08] As soon as I find it
[1759.08 → 1761.40] Okay
[1761.40 → 1763.56] An argument developed
[1763.56 → 1765.44] Between some of John's disciples
[1765.44 → 1766.42] And a certain Jew
[1766.42 → 1769.04] Over the matter of ceremonial washing
[1769.04 → 1770.74] They came to John
[1770.74 → 1771.92] And said to him
[1771.92 → 1774.16] Rabbi, that man
[1774.16 → 1775.48] Who was with you
[1775.48 → 1776.82] On the other side of the Jordan
[1776.82 → 1778.58] The one you testified about
[1778.58 → 1781.00] Well, he is baptizing
[1781.00 → 1783.70] And everyone is going to him
[1783.70 → 1786.14] To this, John replied
[1786.14 → 1788.04] A man can receive only
[1788.04 → 1789.30] What is given him from heaven
[1789.30 → 1791.40] You yourselves can testify
[1791.40 → 1792.02] That I said
[1792.02 → 1793.12] I am not the Messiah
[1793.12 → 1793.88] The Christ
[1793.88 → 1796.24] But am sent ahead of him
[1796.24 → 1799.28] The bride belongs to the bridegroom
[1799.28 → 1801.96] The friend who attends the bridegroom
[1801.96 → 1803.44] Waits and listens for him
[1803.44 → 1805.04] And is full of joy
[1805.04 → 1806.72] When he hears the bridegroom's voice
[1806.72 → 1808.52] That joy is mine
[1808.52 → 1810.84] And it is now complete
[1810.84 → 1813.18] He must become greater
[1813.18 → 1815.84] I must become less
[1815.84 → 1817.88] This is the Word of the Lord
[1817.88 → 1821.92] So join me in prayer
[1821.92 → 1823.62] As we ask for God's blessing
[1823.62 → 1825.12] Upon the reading and preaching of his Word
[1825.12 → 1828.04] Lord, to you all hearts are open
[1828.04 → 1830.14] And from you
[1830.14 → 1831.34] No secrets are hid
[1831.34 → 1833.14] You can see perfectly
[1833.14 → 1834.84] What each of us needs this morning
[1834.84 → 1836.42] In your care for us
[1836.42 → 1838.94] And we pray that we would receive
[1838.94 → 1840.40] Of your care this morning
[1840.40 → 1843.14] Would you awaken us with your love
[1843.14 → 1845.18] Would you give us a greater
[1845.18 → 1846.70] And a clearer sense
[1846.70 → 1848.00] Of who you are
[1848.00 → 1849.50] That we might know
[1849.50 → 1850.54] And worship you truly
[1850.54 → 1852.80] We pray this not only for
[1852.80 → 1854.66] Our own joy
[1854.66 → 1856.18] But for the world's good
[1856.18 → 1857.22] And for your glory
[1857.22 → 1858.84] In Christ's name we pray
[1858.84 → 1859.66] Amen
[1859.66 → 1861.66] So you know how
[1861.66 → 1864.22] There are two solaces
[1864.22 → 1867.06] Solstices
[1867.06 → 1868.42] I think that's how you pronounce it
[1868.42 → 1870.38] The winter solstice
[1870.38 → 1871.66] Which is of course
[1871.66 → 1872.86] The shortest day of the year
[1872.86 → 1874.94] And the summer solstice
[1874.94 → 1876.66] The longest day of the year
[1876.66 → 1878.74] So this winter
[1878.74 → 1881.00] Our family decided to
[1881.00 → 1882.32] Power up
[1882.32 → 1884.40] Our Christmas light game
[1884.40 → 1886.24] Previous years
[1886.24 → 1886.74] We just had
[1886.74 → 1887.68] You know a couple strands
[1887.68 → 1888.44] And it was kind of nice
[1888.44 → 1889.38] But this year we thought
[1889.38 → 1890.24] You know what
[1890.24 → 1891.86] We need to do better
[1891.86 → 1893.08] So we went to the store
[1893.08 → 1894.50] We got some more lights
[1894.50 → 1895.60] And now you know
[1895.60 → 1896.02] The kids
[1896.02 → 1897.18] They hung them on the tree
[1897.18 → 1898.00] In the bushes
[1898.00 → 1899.14] In front of the house
[1899.14 → 1901.88] And now we are respectable
[1901.88 → 1903.10] You know house
[1903.10 → 1903.76] In the suburbs
[1903.76 → 1905.18] And even our neighbour
[1905.18 → 1905.98] Came over and said
[1905.98 → 1906.78] Oh you know I like
[1906.78 → 1907.58] What you did with the lights
[1907.58 → 1908.46] So good
[1908.46 → 1910.14] And it's a lovely way
[1910.14 → 1910.90] To lighten up
[1910.90 → 1912.66] Those dark winter days
[1912.66 → 1914.14] Something I really appreciate
[1914.14 → 1915.32] Here
[1915.32 → 1917.32] Now in the summer
[1917.32 → 1919.04] It's so fun
[1919.04 → 1920.94] To be outside at 9pm
[1920.94 → 1922.70] With the still light outside
[1922.70 → 1924.36] To see the sun
[1924.36 → 1925.28] Kind of still hovering
[1925.28 → 1926.32] Over the horizon
[1926.32 → 1929.62] Now the reason I'm talking
[1929.62 → 1931.32] About this winter solstice
[1931.32 → 1932.50] And the summer solstice
[1932.50 → 1933.58] Is because of something
[1933.58 → 1934.44] Pretty cool
[1934.44 → 1935.66] That I learned this week
[1935.66 → 1937.30] I learned that
[1937.30 → 1938.40] The feast day
[1938.40 → 1939.36] Of John the Baptist
[1939.36 → 1941.60] In the church calendar
[1941.60 → 1943.64] Is on the summer solstice
[1943.64 → 1944.08] In June
[1944.08 → 1945.82] The longest day of the year
[1945.82 → 1949.14] Now why did the early church
[1949.14 → 1950.54] Decide to celebrate
[1950.54 → 1951.52] John the Baptist
[1951.52 → 1952.80] His life and his ministry
[1952.80 → 1956.38] On the longest day of the year
[1956.38 → 1960.34] It's because of what John says
[1960.34 → 1962.42] In our passage this morning
[1962.42 → 1963.78] Look again with me
[1963.78 → 1964.68] At verse 30
[1964.68 → 1967.28] Please keep your Bibles open
[1967.28 → 1969.70] If you need to open them back up
[1969.70 → 1970.28] You can do that
[1970.28 → 1971.42] Verse 30
[1971.42 → 1973.90] He must become greater
[1973.90 → 1977.32] I must become less
[1977.32 → 1979.72] So in our passage
[1979.72 → 1979.88] So in our passage
[1979.88 → 1980.84] People are saying
[1980.84 → 1983.26] John aren't you upset
[1983.26 → 1984.44] That this guy
[1984.44 → 1985.42] This Jesus
[1985.42 → 1988.22] Is taking all of your business
[1988.22 → 1989.16] Right
[1989.16 → 1989.86] Your followers
[1989.86 → 1992.28] Are beginning to follow him
[1992.28 → 1994.90] Jesus is getting all the attention
[1994.90 → 1996.54] And John says
[1996.54 → 1997.88] No I'm not upset
[1997.88 → 1999.56] That's the point
[1999.56 → 2000.40] Okay
[2000.40 → 2002.46] That is my job
[2002.46 → 2005.40] He must become greater
[2005.40 → 2007.86] I must become less
[2007.86 → 2009.26] Right
[2009.26 → 2010.72] John knows that he is only
[2010.72 → 2012.00] A supporting actor
[2012.00 → 2012.94] Right
[2012.94 → 2015.02] John is not the main character
[2015.02 → 2017.08] And as John's ministry
[2017.08 → 2018.54] As it progressed
[2018.54 → 2021.02] As he gains renown
[2021.02 → 2022.82] As he gains fame
[2022.82 → 2025.48] The high point of his ministry
[2025.48 → 2028.16] Is to hand everything
[2028.16 → 2030.44] Over to Jesus
[2030.44 → 2033.52] And did you know
[2033.52 → 2036.14] That Jesus' very first disciples
[2036.14 → 2038.14] Are given him
[2038.14 → 2039.28] By John the Baptist
[2039.28 → 2040.38] Right
[2040.38 → 2042.04] So John was the forerunner
[2042.04 → 2044.50] He had a ministry already
[2044.50 → 2046.86] He was attracting people around him
[2046.86 → 2048.70] With his prophetic teaching
[2048.70 → 2050.38] Calling people
[2050.38 → 2051.94] To return to the Lord
[2051.94 → 2054.06] To await the coming Messiah
[2054.06 → 2056.32] And then when Jesus shows up
[2056.32 → 2056.84] John says
[2056.84 → 2058.80] Look the Lamb of God
[2058.80 → 2061.04] And then John actually
[2061.04 → 2062.90] Gives some of his followers
[2062.90 → 2063.60] To Jesus
[2063.60 → 2066.38] So we can see this earlier
[2066.38 → 2067.14] In John's Gospel
[2067.14 → 2068.26] If you have your Bible open
[2068.26 → 2069.72] Turn back one page with me
[2069.72 → 2071.24] To look at
[2071.24 → 2072.50] Chapter 1
[2072.50 → 2074.16] Verse 35
[2074.16 → 2076.92] So John chapter 1
[2076.92 → 2078.20] Verse 35
[2078.20 → 2080.08] Says this
[2080.08 → 2081.30] The next day
[2081.30 → 2082.70] John was there again
[2082.70 → 2084.26] With two of his disciples
[2084.26 → 2086.36] When he saw Jesus
[2086.36 → 2087.12] Passing by
[2087.12 → 2087.52] He said
[2087.52 → 2088.88] Look the Lamb of God
[2088.88 → 2090.86] When the two disciples
[2090.86 → 2092.10] Heard him say this
[2092.10 → 2094.42] They followed Jesus
[2094.42 → 2096.96] Right
[2096.96 → 2097.92] John gave
[2097.92 → 2098.94] Some of his disciples
[2098.94 → 2099.58] To Jesus
[2099.58 → 2100.78] At the beginning
[2100.78 → 2101.82] Of Jesus' ministry
[2101.82 → 2103.26] And in fact
[2103.26 → 2103.94] We find out
[2103.94 → 2105.36] That one of those two
[2105.36 → 2106.92] Who began to follow Jesus
[2106.92 → 2107.86] His name was Andrew
[2107.86 → 2109.96] Simon Peter's brother
[2109.96 → 2111.66] And so Peter
[2111.66 → 2111.94] Right
[2111.94 → 2113.64] We think of as
[2113.64 → 2115.12] The greatest of the apostles
[2115.12 → 2117.36] He only gets connected
[2117.36 → 2118.02] To Jesus
[2118.02 → 2119.56] Because of his brother
[2119.56 → 2120.06] Andrew
[2120.06 → 2121.76] Who was originally
[2121.76 → 2123.36] A follower of John
[2123.36 → 2125.84] So in John's ministry
[2125.84 → 2126.66] The high point
[2126.66 → 2127.86] The greatest thing
[2127.86 → 2129.10] John does
[2129.10 → 2130.92] Is to make disciples
[2130.92 → 2132.34] That he gives away
[2132.34 → 2132.94] To Jesus
[2132.94 → 2135.92] And so Jesus' birthday
[2135.92 → 2137.40] Is celebrated
[2137.40 → 2139.68] On the shortest day
[2139.68 → 2141.08] Of the year
[2141.08 → 2142.66] According to the Roman calendar
[2142.66 → 2143.36] Which we now know
[2143.36 → 2144.06] Is a little bit inaccurate
[2144.06 → 2144.68] But
[2144.68 → 2146.32] The whole point though
[2146.32 → 2147.96] Is that it's the shortest day
[2147.96 → 2148.76] Of the year
[2148.76 → 2150.68] But then
[2150.68 → 2151.32] What happens?
[2152.10 → 2152.74] The days
[2152.74 → 2153.50] Get longer
[2153.50 → 2155.00] And longer
[2155.00 → 2156.36] His light
[2156.36 → 2157.76] Becomes brighter
[2157.76 → 2158.60] And brighter
[2158.60 → 2160.08] Whereas John's birthday
[2160.08 → 2160.72] Is celebrated
[2160.72 → 2161.84] On the longest day
[2161.84 → 2162.36] Of the year
[2162.36 → 2163.52] And each day
[2163.52 → 2164.36] His light
[2164.36 → 2165.00] Becomes
[2165.00 → 2166.14] Less
[2166.14 → 2167.50] And less
[2167.50 → 2170.00] Cool right?
[2170.64 → 2171.60] You get it?
[2172.30 → 2173.30] So with the coming
[2173.30 → 2173.80] Of Christmas
[2173.80 → 2174.66] We know that
[2174.66 → 2175.52] The darkest days
[2175.52 → 2176.02] Of the year
[2176.02 → 2176.94] Are behind us
[2176.94 → 2177.86] And the days
[2177.86 → 2178.78] Are already now
[2178.78 → 2179.22] Beginning
[2179.22 → 2180.58] To increase
[2180.58 → 2181.28] A little bit
[2181.28 → 2181.86] In length
[2181.86 → 2182.60] Day by day
[2182.60 → 2186.26] And so this morning
[2186.26 → 2188.58] John invites us
[2188.58 → 2189.18] To wonder
[2189.18 → 2191.50] What would it mean
[2191.50 → 2192.56] For Christ
[2192.56 → 2194.18] To become greater
[2194.18 → 2195.06] In our lives?
[2196.38 → 2197.34] What would it mean
[2197.34 → 2198.24] For Christ to become
[2198.24 → 2198.64] Greater
[2198.64 → 2200.18] In our lives?
[2200.42 → 2201.24] What would it mean
[2201.24 → 2202.48] For the light of Christ
[2202.48 → 2203.02] To appear
[2203.02 → 2204.84] Earlier in our days?
[2205.46 → 2206.50] To shine brighter?
[2207.46 → 2208.92] And to extend
[2208.92 → 2210.24] Further into our evenings?
[2211.62 → 2213.14] John was able to say
[2213.14 → 2214.78] Freely and joyfully
[2214.78 → 2216.42] He must become greater
[2216.42 → 2217.96] I must become less
[2217.96 → 2220.76] What might that look like
[2220.76 → 2222.02] For you?
[2224.48 → 2226.26] And to answer that question
[2226.26 → 2227.52] I want us to look
[2227.52 → 2228.36] Just at one thing
[2228.36 → 2228.86] This morning
[2228.86 → 2229.68] That John says
[2229.68 → 2230.32] In our passage
[2230.32 → 2231.80] So again
[2231.80 → 2232.86] Our passage begins
[2232.86 → 2233.88] With John's followers
[2233.88 → 2234.90] They're coming to him
[2234.90 → 2235.90] And they think
[2235.90 → 2236.80] They're going to bring him
[2236.80 → 2237.50] Bad news
[2237.50 → 2238.20] They say
[2238.20 → 2238.50] Look
[2238.50 → 2239.90] People are deserting you
[2239.90 → 2240.46] For Jesus
[2240.46 → 2242.02] You're losing followers
[2242.02 → 2243.04] To this guy
[2243.04 → 2243.94] That you helped
[2243.94 → 2244.74] Get started
[2244.74 → 2246.06] Isn't that terrible?
[2247.44 → 2248.50] And notice what John
[2248.50 → 2249.46] How he replies
[2249.46 → 2251.00] In chapter 3 verse 27
[2251.00 → 2253.44] Chapter 3 verse 27
[2253.44 → 2254.12] He says
[2254.12 → 2255.86] To this John replied
[2255.86 → 2257.70] A man can receive
[2257.70 → 2258.88] Only what is given him
[2258.88 → 2260.00] From heaven
[2260.00 → 2262.26] A man can receive
[2262.26 → 2263.92] Only what is given him
[2263.92 → 2265.40] From heaven
[2265.40 → 2267.32] See this was an awareness
[2267.32 → 2268.42] That John had
[2268.42 → 2270.44] Of the givenness
[2270.44 → 2271.64] Of all things
[2271.64 → 2272.94] As Marilyn Robinson
[2272.94 → 2274.38] So beautifully puts it
[2274.38 → 2275.40] The givenness
[2275.40 → 2276.08] Of all things
[2276.08 → 2277.46] And Paul
[2277.46 → 2277.72] You know
[2277.72 → 2278.78] He says the same thing
[2278.78 → 2279.64] In 1 Corinthians
[2279.64 → 2281.08] Paul says
[2281.08 → 2282.16] What do you have
[2282.16 → 2283.30] That you did not receive?
[2284.62 → 2286.24] See Jesus was attracting
[2286.24 → 2287.02] And winning
[2287.02 → 2288.58] More followers
[2288.58 → 2289.42] Than John
[2289.42 → 2291.30] But that was not
[2291.30 → 2292.00] Because Jesus
[2292.00 → 2293.00] Was like stealing
[2293.00 → 2294.76] Them away from John
[2294.76 → 2296.50] But because John
[2296.50 → 2297.28] Was pointing them
[2297.28 → 2297.88] To Jesus
[2297.88 → 2299.74] And John recognizes
[2299.74 → 2300.52] That it was because
[2300.52 → 2301.70] God was giving
[2301.70 → 2303.34] His followers
[2303.34 → 2304.58] To Jesus
[2304.58 → 2306.22] To become Jesus' followers
[2306.22 → 2308.52] And it's a beautiful thing
[2308.52 → 2308.76] Friends
[2308.76 → 2310.26] That John recognizes this
[2310.26 → 2311.66] When John says
[2311.66 → 2313.68] I must become less
[2313.68 → 2315.50] He is in a way
[2315.50 → 2316.64] Saying I am not
[2316.64 → 2317.30] At the centre
[2317.30 → 2318.88] I'm not the centre
[2318.88 → 2319.82] Of God's plans
[2319.82 → 2320.96] Of his redemption
[2320.96 → 2321.66] I'm not even
[2321.66 → 2322.26] At the centre
[2322.26 → 2323.80] Of what God
[2323.80 → 2324.32] Has in store
[2324.32 → 2325.14] For my life
[2325.14 → 2327.02] I need to be
[2327.02 → 2328.28] Re-entered
[2328.28 → 2331.36] And if we
[2331.36 → 2332.84] We try to position
[2332.84 → 2333.76] Ourselves
[2333.76 → 2334.58] In the centre
[2334.58 → 2335.62] Of our world
[2335.62 → 2336.10] Where everything
[2336.10 → 2337.14] Revolves around us
[2337.14 → 2338.26] We are always
[2338.26 → 2338.82] Wondering
[2338.82 → 2339.66] How we can
[2339.66 → 2341.08] Angle ourselves
[2341.08 → 2342.28] For a better position
[2342.28 → 2343.92] And we get upset
[2343.92 → 2345.62] If someone else
[2345.62 → 2346.92] Gets in the spotlight
[2346.92 → 2349.42] But think
[2349.42 → 2350.42] Think how refreshing
[2350.42 → 2351.50] It would be
[2351.50 → 2352.28] If we can imagine
[2352.28 → 2352.84] This together
[2352.84 → 2354.28] Think how refreshing
[2354.28 → 2355.00] It would be
[2355.00 → 2356.64] In our workplaces
[2356.64 → 2358.42] In our homes
[2358.42 → 2359.52] In our communities
[2359.52 → 2360.50] In our churches
[2360.50 → 2362.66] If we could see
[2362.66 → 2363.78] Our family members
[2363.78 → 2364.52] And our neighbours
[2364.52 → 2365.66] And our brothers
[2365.66 → 2366.94] And sisters in Christ
[2366.94 → 2368.64] Doing well at something
[2368.64 → 2370.20] And we think
[2370.20 → 2371.20] Wow God has really
[2371.20 → 2372.10] Gifted them
[2372.10 → 2373.78] God is doing
[2373.78 → 2375.04] Something wonderful
[2375.04 → 2376.90] Through them
[2376.90 → 2379.74] And how
[2379.74 → 2380.46] I mean
[2380.46 → 2381.58] How often
[2381.58 → 2383.04] Do we
[2383.04 → 2385.02] Celebrate other people
[2385.02 → 2387.30] How often
[2387.30 → 2388.84] Do we criticize
[2388.84 → 2392.16] What would cause
[2392.16 → 2393.60] Words of celebration
[2393.60 → 2395.46] And blessing
[2395.46 → 2396.26] And encouragement
[2396.26 → 2397.32] To increase
[2397.32 → 2399.00] In your life
[2399.00 → 2401.84] And what would cause
[2401.84 → 2403.00] Words of criticism
[2403.00 → 2403.98] To decrease
[2403.98 → 2408.50] Think about this
[2408.50 → 2409.46] What would you like
[2409.46 → 2409.96] To see
[2409.96 → 2411.36] Increase
[2411.36 → 2412.96] In the experience
[2412.96 → 2413.80] That others have
[2413.80 → 2414.18] Of you
[2414.18 → 2417.70] Maybe what words
[2417.70 → 2418.60] Would you like to
[2418.60 → 2420.10] Say more often
[2420.10 → 2420.82] Or mean
[2420.82 → 2421.64] More deeply
[2421.64 → 2423.36] Maybe words like
[2423.36 → 2423.92] Love
[2423.92 → 2425.86] Or thanks
[2425.86 → 2428.84] What would you like
[2428.84 → 2429.26] To see
[2429.26 → 2430.46] Decrease
[2430.46 → 2431.82] In the experience
[2431.82 → 2432.52] That others have
[2432.52 → 2432.92] Of you
[2432.92 → 2434.40] You know
[2434.40 → 2435.02] What traits
[2435.02 → 2435.68] Or habits
[2435.68 → 2436.38] Need to be
[2436.38 → 2437.30] Kind of turned
[2437.30 → 2438.60] Down in the mix
[2438.60 → 2440.00] Of your life
[2440.00 → 2442.26] See John
[2442.26 → 2443.02] Was able
[2443.02 → 2443.90] To freely
[2443.90 → 2445.30] And with great
[2445.30 → 2445.82] Joy
[2445.82 → 2446.28] Say
[2446.28 → 2447.40] He must
[2447.40 → 2448.22] Increase
[2448.22 → 2449.30] I must
[2449.30 → 2450.36] Become less
[2450.36 → 2452.18] And the only way
[2452.18 → 2452.64] Friends that we
[2452.64 → 2453.48] Can do that
[2453.48 → 2454.86] Is that we
[2454.86 → 2455.76] Turn our eyes
[2455.76 → 2456.26] Away from
[2456.26 → 2456.88] Ourselves
[2456.88 → 2457.86] And we turn
[2457.86 → 2458.54] Them to
[2458.54 → 2458.98] Jesus
[2458.98 → 2460.56] We fix
[2460.56 → 2461.12] Our eyes
[2461.12 → 2461.78] On Jesus
[2461.78 → 2462.56] And we want
[2462.56 → 2462.88] To see
[2462.88 → 2464.00] His name
[2464.00 → 2465.00] And his glory
[2465.00 → 2466.00] Increase
[2466.00 → 2466.80] Increase
[2466.80 → 2467.98] In the world
[2467.98 → 2469.88] And when we
[2469.88 → 2470.64] Direct our attention
[2470.64 → 2471.20] To Jesus
[2471.20 → 2472.62] It frees us
[2472.62 → 2473.26] To think less
[2473.26 → 2473.88] Of ourselves
[2473.88 → 2475.24] And to think more
[2475.24 → 2476.26] Of Christ
[2476.26 → 2477.32] And of others
[2477.32 → 2478.44] And so
[2478.44 → 2479.42] What joy
[2479.42 → 2480.10] Might you have
[2480.10 → 2480.64] Or what
[2480.64 → 2482.26] Anxieties
[2482.26 → 2483.42] Might become
[2483.42 → 2484.16] More relaxed
[2484.16 → 2486.12] If your relationship
[2486.12 → 2486.66] With God
[2486.66 → 2487.32] Could be one
[2487.32 → 2487.96] In which you see
[2487.96 → 2488.48] God
[2488.48 → 2489.50] As the giver
[2489.50 → 2490.56] Of all that you have
[2490.56 → 2492.46] Right
[2492.46 → 2493.04] What if you could
[2493.04 → 2493.92] Trust him
[2493.92 → 2494.96] With the person
[2494.96 → 2495.42] That he has
[2495.42 → 2496.30] Made you to be
[2496.30 → 2498.18] With the life stage
[2498.18 → 2499.32] That you are in
[2499.32 → 2499.90] Right now
[2499.90 → 2501.60] In the relationships
[2501.60 → 2502.26] That you have
[2502.26 → 2503.30] In the tasks
[2503.30 → 2504.60] That he has now
[2504.60 → 2505.64] Entrusted you to do
[2505.64 → 2507.62] Right
[2507.62 → 2508.84] John knew Jesus
[2508.84 → 2510.06] He loved Jesus
[2510.06 → 2511.78] But you know what
[2511.78 → 2512.78] John did not see
[2512.78 → 2513.68] And he did not know
[2513.68 → 2515.30] What we know today
[2515.30 → 2516.92] We now know
[2516.92 → 2518.24] What Jesus came
[2518.24 → 2519.06] To do
[2519.06 → 2520.84] Jesus came
[2520.84 → 2521.08] Friends
[2521.08 → 2521.86] To be our saviour
[2521.86 → 2523.58] And in doing so
[2523.58 → 2524.92] He let himself
[2524.92 → 2526.66] Become less
[2526.66 → 2528.58] So that we
[2528.58 → 2530.28] Might become greater
[2530.28 → 2532.76] One of my favourite
[2532.76 → 2533.64] Christmas hymns
[2533.64 → 2534.70] Celebrates
[2534.70 → 2535.98] This
[2535.98 → 2537.12] What Jesus came
[2537.12 → 2537.94] To do for us
[2537.94 → 2539.18] And it goes like this
[2539.18 → 2539.72] We have the words
[2539.72 → 2540.24] On the screen
[2540.24 → 2543.74] Thou who is rich
[2543.74 → 2545.84] Beyond all splendour
[2545.84 → 2547.68] All for love's sake
[2547.68 → 2549.16] Became as poor
[2549.16 → 2550.80] Thrones
[2550.80 → 2552.08] For a manger
[2552.08 → 2553.08] Did surrender
[2553.08 → 2554.52] Sapphire
[2554.52 → 2555.58] Paved courts
[2555.58 → 2557.42] For a stable floor
[2557.42 → 2559.96] Thou who art God
[2559.96 → 2561.34] Beyond all praising
[2561.34 → 2564.00] All for love's sake
[2564.00 → 2565.28] Became as man
[2565.28 → 2567.80] Stooping so low
[2567.80 → 2569.88] But sinners raising
[2569.88 → 2571.44] Heavenwards
[2571.44 → 2574.08] By thy eternal plan
[2574.08 → 2577.36] Thou who art love
[2577.36 → 2578.96] Beyond all telling
[2578.96 → 2580.58] Saviour and king
[2580.58 → 2581.56] We worship thee
[2581.56 → 2582.88] Emmanuel
[2582.88 → 2584.62] Within us dwelling
[2584.62 → 2587.08] Make us what thou
[2587.08 → 2588.02] Would have
[2588.02 → 2588.86] Us
[2588.86 → 2589.50] Be
[2589.50 → 2591.86] It's beautiful
[2591.86 → 2593.72] Friends
[2593.72 → 2594.70] Jesus came
[2594.70 → 2595.58] To give himself
[2595.58 → 2596.44] For us
[2596.44 → 2598.14] So that our joy
[2598.14 → 2598.96] Would be complete
[2598.96 → 2599.84] Like John the Baptist
[2599.84 → 2600.28] Says
[2600.28 → 2601.82] And so that he
[2601.82 → 2602.70] So that we
[2602.70 → 2603.56] Would then be able
[2603.56 → 2604.48] To make much
[2604.48 → 2605.38] Of him
[2605.38 → 2606.60] In our hearts
[2606.60 → 2607.34] And lives
[2607.34 → 2609.28] We don't get
[2609.28 → 2609.86] To increase
[2609.86 → 2610.56] Ourselves
[2610.56 → 2612.42] Because
[2612.42 → 2613.50] God
[2613.50 → 2614.40] Has increased
[2614.40 → 2614.84] Us
[2614.84 → 2615.96] For us
[2615.96 → 2616.92] Right
[2616.92 → 2617.52] He came to
[2617.52 → 2618.24] Raise us up
[2618.24 → 2618.66] He came
[2618.66 → 2620.02] To transform us
[2620.02 → 2620.80] And to make us
[2620.80 → 2621.82] Ready and fit
[2621.82 → 2622.56] For his heavenly
[2622.56 → 2622.94] Kingdom
[2622.94 → 2624.62] And he's the only
[2624.62 → 2625.46] One who can bring
[2625.46 → 2625.92] That about
[2625.92 → 2626.64] In our lives
[2626.64 → 2628.22] And so friends
[2628.22 → 2629.10] Here's God's promise
[2629.10 → 2629.92] To you this morning
[2629.92 → 2631.24] When you confess
[2631.24 → 2632.38] That you are not
[2632.38 → 2633.30] Your own saviour
[2633.30 → 2634.84] As John says
[2634.84 → 2635.94] I am not the messiah
[2635.94 → 2638.12] When you can say
[2638.12 → 2639.32] I am not the messiah
[2639.32 → 2640.56] I am not my own saviour
[2640.56 → 2642.00] But you trust
[2642.00 → 2643.28] That he is
[2643.28 → 2645.38] Then you enter
[2645.38 → 2646.38] Into a life
[2646.38 → 2647.68] Where he increases
[2647.68 → 2648.30] In you
[2648.30 → 2650.32] Just like
[2650.32 → 2651.00] The light
[2651.00 → 2652.10] At this time of year
[2652.10 → 2653.46] Slowly
[2653.46 → 2654.44] But surely
[2654.44 → 2655.88] Grows in brightness
[2655.88 → 2657.54] Day after day
[2657.54 → 2659.30] So friends
[2659.30 → 2660.08] May you know
[2660.08 → 2660.86] The joy
[2660.86 → 2661.58] Of Christ
[2661.58 → 2663.02] Increasing in you
[2663.02 → 2663.98] This Christmas
[2663.98 → 2665.08] Increasing
[2665.08 → 2666.58] His presence
[2666.58 → 2667.36] In your life
[2667.36 → 2668.72] His power
[2668.72 → 2669.54] In your life
[2669.54 → 2670.42] His goodness
[2670.42 → 2672.04] And his glory
[2672.04 → 2674.06] May it ever increase
[2674.06 → 2675.38] For God's glory
[2675.38 → 2676.24] Amen
[2676.24 → 2677.56] Let's pray
[2677.56 → 2681.58] Father we give you
[2681.58 → 2682.36] Thanks this morning
[2682.36 → 2683.14] For your word
[2683.14 → 2684.98] And may it speak
[2684.98 → 2686.08] Into the longings
[2686.08 → 2686.98] That we have
[2686.98 → 2688.28] And may it
[2688.28 → 2689.28] Ultimately point
[2689.28 → 2691.00] To Jesus
[2691.00 → 2692.10] Who is the true
[2692.10 → 2692.64] Source
[2692.64 → 2693.54] Of our joy
[2693.54 → 2695.08] And we ask
[2695.08 → 2695.66] Lord today
[2695.66 → 2696.20] That you would
[2696.20 → 2697.46] So work in our lives
[2697.46 → 2698.52] That the world
[2698.52 → 2699.20] Would see more
[2699.20 → 2700.10] And more of you
[2700.10 → 2700.76] In us
[2700.76 → 2703.04] And that as that
[2703.04 → 2703.44] Happens
[2703.44 → 2704.12] We also would
[2704.12 → 2705.14] Become more
[2705.14 → 2705.62] And more
[2705.62 → 2706.28] Who you have
[2706.28 → 2707.10] Made us to be
[2707.10 → 2708.28] As your sons
[2708.28 → 2708.80] And daughters
[2708.80 → 2710.26] Lord may you
[2710.26 → 2711.04] Increase
[2711.04 → 2712.96] And may we
[2712.96 → 2713.64] Become less
[2713.64 → 2714.34] For your glory
[2714.34 → 2715.52] In Jesus name
[2715.52 → 2715.92] We pray
[2715.92 → 2716.72] Amen
[2716.72 → 2725.04] Alright so let's
[2725.04 → 2725.72] Stand and let's
[2725.72 → 2726.38] Sing another
[2726.38 → 2727.38] Christmas carol
[2727.38 → 2727.84] Together
[2757.38 → 2766.92] Angels we have
[2766.92 → 2767.92] We are
[2767.92 → 2768.86] We are
[2768.86 → 2771.36] Sweetly singing
[2771.36 → 2773.64] Over the plain
[2773.64 → 2776.76] And the mountains
[2776.76 → 2778.76] In reply
[2778.76 → 2781.60] Echoing their
[2781.60 → 2783.48] Joyous strains
[2783.48 → 2798.42] Gloria
[2798.42 → 2801.20] Gloria
[2801.20 → 2808.08] In hence
[2808.08 → 2808.96] Francis
[2808.96 → 2813.96] and the rain shall sing still.
[2815.96 → 2820.96] Shepherds, why this jubilee?
[2820.96 → 2825.96] Why your joyous traits provide?
[2825.96 → 2830.96] What thou blessed some tithing tree
[2830.96 → 2835.96] which inspire your heavenly song?
[2835.96 → 2849.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2849.96 → 2864.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2865.96 → 2872.96] Come to Bethlehem and see,
[2872.96 → 2877.96] Him who's burned the age of sea.
[2877.96 → 2881.96] Come adore our heavenly,
[2881.96 → 2886.96] Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
[2886.96 → 2901.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2901.96 → 2916.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2916.96 → 2923.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2923.96 → 2926.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2926.96 → 2932.96] Glorias, Gloria, in et chiasms tea.
[2932.96 → 2938.86] I'm sorry, please be seated.
[2944.68 → 2951.38] So, on this Christmas Day, we also pray for the world, we pray for our community, we pray for the gospel to go forth.
[2951.90 → 2953.72] And so, would you please join me in prayer?
[2954.06 → 2954.70] Let's pray together.
[2954.70 → 2963.98] Great God and Father, we rejoice that we can address you as our Father.
[2964.98 → 2971.84] Not on our own merits, but on the merits of your Son, in whose name we pray these things.
[2972.56 → 2977.60] We pray for all the conflicts and the trials around the world.
[2978.48 → 2983.12] We ask that you would return and bring complete peace.
[2983.12 → 2988.06] And in the meantime, Lord, that you would ease suffering.
[2988.96 → 2991.34] That you would comfort those who are afflicted.
[2991.88 → 2996.88] That you would draw people to yourself in the midst of the suffering of this fallen world.
[2998.14 → 3008.98] Lord, we rejoice that our citizenship, our true belonging is not here, but it is in heaven, your kingdom, with you.
[3008.98 → 3014.32] And so, we pray for the work of your church, your kingdom here on earth.
[3014.94 → 3022.66] Lord, as we gather into your church today and during this Christmas season, we pray that your gospel would go out in power.
[3023.42 → 3028.62] That your spirit would be mightily at work in the hearts of people.
[3028.62 → 3035.42] Lord, we pray for the people that you would bring dead people to life.
[3036.46 → 3041.38] Lord, we pray particularly for our other sister churches in Ladder.
[3041.72 → 3048.36] Lord, would you bless them and all of us as we proclaim your Son and his arrival this morning.
[3048.36 → 3053.88] Lord, we pray for the missionaries that we support.
[3054.70 → 3055.82] Hannah in Greece.
[3056.54 → 3058.52] Ajee and Anne and their family in Egypt.
[3058.72 → 3063.74] The Johnson's ministering and sharing the gospel amongst First Nations communities in BC.
[3064.60 → 3069.76] We pray for Alex who is raising support and getting ready to move to the Middle East.
[3069.76 → 3081.62] Lord, on this Christmas Day, would you fill them all with the hope of Christ and the joy of knowing you and serving you in the places where you have placed each one of them.
[3082.20 → 3088.48] Lord, give us that same joy this morning in this place, in this time when you have placed us.
[3089.18 → 3097.02] Lord, would we not see our work as any less extraordinary, any less necessary for the kingdom.
[3097.02 → 3102.14] Would you make each one of us missionaries to our families and neighbours around us.
[3103.06 → 3105.62] Lord, we also pray for the needs of our congregation.
[3106.72 → 3113.78] That as many who are travelling, Lord, for them would you give protection and safety.
[3114.84 → 3119.14] Lord, for those of us who are gathering with family, would you bless those times.
[3119.88 → 3122.06] Where there is conflict, would you bring healing.
[3122.06 → 3132.24] Where there are those who do not yet know you, would you provide avenues and opportunities to share the love of Jesus, both in word and in deed.
[3133.58 → 3138.22] Lord, we pray particularly for those who are away from family this Christmas.
[3139.02 → 3140.76] Would you comfort and encourage them.
[3141.52 → 3143.92] Would you comfort and encourage their families who miss them.
[3143.92 → 3150.32] We pray also for those in our midst for whom Christmas is a lonely time.
[3151.04 → 3151.86] A sad time.
[3151.98 → 3153.84] A time of grief in the face of loss.
[3154.86 → 3155.90] Would you be with them.
[3156.52 → 3157.56] Lord, would you comfort them.
[3158.34 → 3164.78] And God, with the truth of your arrival in your son Jesus Christ, give them that great hope of your future promise.
[3164.78 → 3169.36] That when you return, we will all dwell together.
[3169.88 → 3174.08] In your name, around your table, forever and ever.
[3175.44 → 3178.80] Lord, we pray for those in our congregation who are sick and suffering.
[3179.72 → 3181.76] This morning we particularly pray for Wilma.
[3182.76 → 3187.92] Lord, would you bless her and all those who need your strength and your encouragement.
[3187.92 → 3191.42] And Lord, we lift all of these things up to you.
[3191.84 → 3196.72] In the name of your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the light of the world.
[3197.40 → 3198.84] And it's in his name we pray.
[3199.44 → 3199.86] Amen.

[3267.14 → 3282.14] O angels feed with anthems sing, while shepherds watch our keeping.
[3282.14 → 3297.14] These days will cry the King, whose shepherds cry and angels sing.
[3297.14 → 3312.14] These days to pray, O Lord, the King, the Son of Man.
[3312.14 → 3326.14] See, in such painless pain, their rottenness is feeling.
[3326.14 → 3340.14] Good Christians, with our Saviour's ear, a silent word we sing.
[3340.14 → 3356.14] This day shall give you free, the cross we bow for before you.
[3356.14 → 3369.14] Hail, hail, the world is there, to make the Son of Man.
[3369.14 → 3385.14] So bring Him lessons, God and earth, the blessed King to all hear.
[3385.14 → 3399.14] The day of kings of ancient kings, their loving hearts and loving kings.
[3399.14 → 3413.14] Please raise the song, O God, the blue, change in your mother's heart.
[3413.14 → 3427.14] Joy, joy, joy, for Christ is born, the wicked soul not bear.

[3461.12 → 3462.84] to the house of Israel.
[3463.50 → 3465.64] May his steadfast love be upon you today
[3465.64 → 3467.12] as you hope in him.
