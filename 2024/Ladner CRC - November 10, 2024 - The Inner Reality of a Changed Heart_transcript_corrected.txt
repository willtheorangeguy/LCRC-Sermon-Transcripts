[1058.00 → 1059.34] Join me in this prayer of confession.
[1059.34 → 1067.86] Heavenly Father, we consider the sins of those who've gone before us.
[1067.86 → 1079.66] We consider the struggles of our own days and the failings that mark our own years and our every hour.
[1079.66 → 1083.58] So your steadfast love, Lord, is amazing.
[1084.38 → 1085.98] Your faithfulness is remarkable.
[1085.98 → 1090.44] And Lord, we praise and acclaim you for the goodness of your word.
[1090.44 → 1097.10] Lord, you have made pledges and promises so very long ago to Abraham and our ancestors.
[1097.82 → 1106.30] And you have time and again, and in the face of every sinful effort, proven yourself faithful and true.
[1106.30 → 1119.30] And we confess, Lord, that we confess, Lord, that we often do cast the blame on others.
[1119.30 → 1124.76] Too often we do spin the story of our struggles.
[1125.76 → 1130.08] And too frequently, Lord, we fail to own up to our sin.
[1130.08 → 1134.56] We long to be honest, and we thank you that you listen.
[1135.24 → 1139.82] We long to be truthful, and we're grateful for the light of your word.
[1140.64 → 1143.42] Search our hearts, we pray, O Lord.
[1143.52 → 1147.36] Help us this morning to come empty-handed and open-hearted.
[1147.98 → 1155.92] That we might open wide our mouths and that you again might fill them with the goodness and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1155.92 → 1159.70] It's in his name that we pray. Amen.
[1161.64 → 1170.54] Now hear these words of the assurance of our forgiveness, our pardon, from 1 Thessalonians and 1 Thessalonians.
[1171.06 → 1172.34] 1, not 1 Philippians.
[1172.58 → 1174.46] Philippians and 1 Thessalonians.
[1174.92 → 1175.68] So here it is.

[1187.04 → 1191.38] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[1192.20 → 1193.32] Thanks be to God.

[1549.60 → 1550.62] Hello, everyone.
[1550.90 → 1551.40] Good morning.
[1551.80 → 1552.76] I'm Nicole Chen.
[1552.76 → 1556.68] I'm pleased to join this family today.
[1561.72 → 1562.24] Hello.
[1562.50 → 1567.26] I'm Pat Craig and I feel very lucky to join such a welcoming church.
[1567.76 → 1570.00] I'm with a great pastor like Pastor Jason.
[1570.00 → 1575.74] Good morning, everybody.
[1576.00 → 1577.00] Many of you know me already.
[1577.28 → 1579.36] I'm David Van Dozen, Rita's son.
[1579.70 → 1582.24] And like Tina said, I feel like I'm returning home.
[1585.16 → 1586.58] Good morning, everyone.
[1586.86 → 1587.52] I'm Carol.
[1588.36 → 1591.70] I want to be joining this big family.
[1595.14 → 1595.70] Hi.
[1595.94 → 1596.54] Good morning.
[1596.78 → 1597.68] My name is Kia.
[1597.68 → 1600.78] I'd like to join this church.
[1601.12 → 1601.50] Thank you.
[1604.76 → 1605.32] Morning.
[1606.08 → 1607.96] My name is Kia.
[1607.96 → 1610.96] And I'd like to join this church.
[1611.78 → 1612.84] Thank you so much.
[1617.78 → 1618.38] Okay.
[1618.64 → 1625.90] So we've been having a membership class the last few weeks when we have talked about
[1625.90 → 1627.26] what does it mean to be a Christian?
[1627.68 → 1630.02] We talked about the story of God's redemption in the Bible.
[1630.50 → 1634.64] We talked about what it means to be a reformed church and about some of our confessions.
[1635.60 → 1642.22] And we also talked about what it means to belong to this local expression of God's family.
[1642.22 → 1650.48] And I commend you all for what you're doing today because it really is a little bit unusual.
[1651.48 → 1656.76] That is, making a commitment to be part of a church family.
[1656.76 → 1664.86] And it's where we say that we belong to God's family around the world.
[1664.86 → 1671.62] And we are a little expression of that right here, where God is calling people from every tongue, tribe, and nation.
[1671.62 → 1675.96] And so we belong to God's body throughout the world.
[1675.96 → 1677.22] And we belong to God's family around the world.
[1677.22 → 1685.08] And we also belong in a very particular way to this church, where we know one another by name, where we can pray for one another.
[1685.08 → 1687.42] We can know what's going on in each other's lives.
[1687.42 → 1690.92] And we can grow in faith together.
[1690.92 → 1693.28] So that's what we're doing here in membership.
[1695.46 → 1703.82] And so what I want to do now is invite you to just affirm again your faith.
[1704.46 → 1706.82] And I will ask you a few vows.
[1707.40 → 1713.72] So we'll read it, and then I'll let you respond to each one saying, I do, God helping me.
[1714.34 → 1714.56] Okay?
[1714.68 → 1716.54] I do, God helping me.
[1716.60 → 1717.66] Or just I do is fine.
[1717.98 → 1718.24] Okay?
[1718.60 → 1720.48] So we'll read each of these vows.
[1720.92 → 1728.74] So first one, do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[1729.08 → 1732.70] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1733.10 → 1738.58] And do you, with repentance and joy, embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1741.58 → 1747.78] Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God, revealing Christ and his redemption,
[1747.78 → 1752.84] and that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[1756.20 → 1759.78] And do you promise to join with us, sharing...
[1759.78 → 1776.78] In our worship and fellowship and in the mission God has given us in the world?
[1778.44 → 1778.78] Okay.
[1778.94 → 1779.42] Thank you.
[1779.42 → 1782.54] Congregation, may I ask you to stand?
[1784.10 → 1785.62] And I'm going to ask you to take a vow.
[1786.68 → 1792.62] And this is to welcome these members into our church family.
[1793.02 → 1798.38] Do you promise to receive these brothers and sisters in love, support them with your fellowship
[1798.38 → 1805.10] and prayers and recognizing their gifts, invite them into the life and mission of our congregation?
[1806.00 → 1808.14] To you, God, our God.
[1808.48 → 1808.88] Okay.
[1809.04 → 1809.64] Let's pray.
[1810.38 → 1817.92] Father, we thank you for the life that you give to each one of us individually, Lord,
[1818.04 → 1822.72] saving us through the death and the resurrection of your Son, Jesus Christ.
[1822.72 → 1826.84] And that you call us together as one body.
[1827.42 → 1831.10] You gather us as your particular church.
[1831.58 → 1837.46] And you work in us, Lord, helping us, having companions on this journey,
[1838.08 → 1843.62] that we might walk together in faith, encouraging one another, lifting one another up,
[1843.66 → 1847.44] and helping one another and carrying one another's burdens.
[1847.44 → 1853.94] And so, Lord, we do that, and we thank you for that work amongst us here at Latter CRC.
[1854.36 → 1860.22] Lord, would you help each of these new members to feel your welcome, to know that they belong,
[1860.92 → 1863.64] and, Lord, and to strive toward that as we do so together.
[1863.78 → 1864.78] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1865.04 → 1865.30] Amen.
[1865.30 → 1865.38] Amen.
[1867.48 → 1869.30] I have a little gift for you.
[1875.46 → 1876.36] Oh, yeah, we need to.
[1877.44 → 1888.00] Thank you.
[1896.00 → 1897.98] Okay, so we're going to do something a bit different.
[1898.32 → 1901.24] If I can have my hand mic on, we'll give it another try.
[1902.08 → 1905.84] I want to do something different, which is to actually have the kids come down now.
[1905.84 → 1906.86] Ah.
[1907.62 → 1911.64] Hope I didn't throw you off too bad, but we'll celebrate in a moment.
[1911.78 → 1913.40] But first, may I have the...
[1913.40 → 1917.58] Come down and join me.
[1927.04 → 1927.82] Here you are.
[1927.82 → 1930.28] The birthday girl is here.
[1936.76 → 1938.02] Be careful of the wire.
[1938.10 → 1938.76] Be careful of the wire.
[1939.20 → 1939.40] Okay.
[1940.12 → 1940.38] Come on.
[1940.42 → 1940.94] Stay over here.
[1946.00 → 1946.70] Watch the wire.
[1947.28 → 1948.26] Why do you guys go that way?
[1949.94 → 1950.26] Okay.
[1950.54 → 1951.08] Hey, everyone.
[1951.08 → 1953.26] You can sit down.
[1953.38 → 1953.64] It's okay.
[1953.70 → 1954.16] You have a seat.
[1954.98 → 1955.18] Hey.
[1956.38 → 1956.82] Good.
[1958.14 → 1958.54] Great.
[1959.46 → 1963.14] So, I want you to look at what we have behind us.
[1963.24 → 1964.14] Don't...
[1964.14 → 1966.72] Because it might be a little bit delicate.
[1967.56 → 1967.76] Okay.
[1967.88 → 1969.16] But do you know what that's about?
[1970.02 → 1970.38] What?
[1972.76 → 1973.32] Remember...
[1973.32 → 1974.48] You're going to say?
[1981.20 → 1981.66] Wow.
[1983.66 → 1984.18] Yes.
[1984.38 → 1989.02] It's about the soldiers, she said, who gave their lives for our freedom.
[1989.86 → 1990.38] Absolutely.
[1990.60 → 1991.72] That's exactly what it's for.
[1991.72 → 1998.72] And so, we remember soldiers who were taught and who...
[1998.72 → 2005.02] And we remember that, right?
[2005.44 → 2007.18] What's one way we remember that?
[2010.52 → 2012.14] A poppy flower, right?
[2012.20 → 2013.30] And you're wearing one, too.
[2013.96 → 2014.22] Right?
[2014.28 → 2015.94] And you might see other people wearing one.
[2015.94 → 2021.74] And so, it comes from that famous film in Flanders Field.
[2022.34 → 2023.92] Do you guys know how it goes?
[2025.48 → 2027.28] In Flanders Field, what?
[2028.14 → 2029.66] The poppies grow?
[2030.88 → 2031.80] Something like that.
[2031.88 → 2032.02] Okay.
[2032.32 → 2037.64] So, it reminds us, though, that on Remembrance Day, all these soldiers who gave their lives
[2037.64 → 2041.06] for our freedom, we remember their sacrifice.
[2041.06 → 2045.06] And we wear this poppy flower to remember...
[2045.06 → 2046.72] That is very important.
[2047.06 → 2048.52] And we honour that.
[2049.00 → 2051.86] But I also think it teaches us something about the Bible.
[2052.44 → 2053.94] It teaches us something about God.
[2054.40 → 2058.80] So, I want to read one verse for us from Luke.
[2059.52 → 2060.94] This is at the Last Supper.
[2061.08 → 2064.60] Jesus was eating with his disciples before he went to the cross to die.
[2065.20 → 2066.16] And he said,
[2066.16 → 2070.90] He took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying,
[2071.50 → 2073.22] This is my body given for you.
[2073.74 → 2074.82] Do this in remembrance.
[2075.06 → 2075.68] Of me.
[2076.64 → 2077.94] You hear that word remembrance?
[2079.14 → 2083.94] It's almost like every time we do what we're about to do, take the Lord's Supper,
[2084.44 → 2085.88] it's like a remembrance day.
[2086.70 → 2088.40] Because we remember...
[2088.40 → 2092.76] What do we remember when we eat the bread and drink from the cup?
[2092.76 → 2109.64] We have a budding preacher.
[2110.84 → 2111.24] Yes.
[2111.64 → 2112.40] And theologian.
[2112.52 → 2113.24] That was very good.
[2114.84 → 2115.24] Yeah.
[2115.64 → 2116.38] So, right.
[2116.52 → 2118.54] Because, yeah, Jesus did that.
[2118.54 → 2120.72] He said, this is my body.
[2120.88 → 2121.44] This is my blood.
[2121.52 → 2122.64] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2122.72 → 2127.02] So, just like every year we remember the soldiers who died for our freedom,
[2127.02 → 2129.14] when we take the Lord's Supper,
[2129.14 → 2132.00] we remember our Saviour,
[2133.00 → 2136.92] who not only died for some people, but he died for the whole world.
[2137.58 → 2140.60] That all could be set free.
[2141.14 → 2144.60] Set free from the power of sin and of the devil.
[2144.60 → 2149.52] And that we could be truly free to know and love Jesus Christ.
[2149.66 → 2149.80] Okay?
[2149.84 → 2153.04] So, that's what we're about to remember as we take this supper.
[2153.16 → 2153.34] Okay?
[2153.58 → 2158.36] So, just as the poppy reminds us of the sacrifice of the soldier,
[2159.02 → 2163.42] taking the bread and the cup reminds us of the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus,
[2163.86 → 2164.78] who died for us.
[2165.20 → 2165.50] Okay?
[2165.94 → 2167.32] I hope that's helpful for us.
[2167.88 → 2168.08] Okay?
[2168.16 → 2169.80] And let's go back to our seats,
[2169.80 → 2173.24] and let's prepare to celebrate the Lord's Supper together.
[2174.60 → 2201.26] Give me this one.
[2201.44 → 2202.42] Okay, we'll stick with this one.
[2204.60 → 2209.38] So, the Lord, this morning, welcomes us to his table.
[2211.02 → 2215.32] Jesus, after he laid down his life for his friends on the cross,
[2215.56 → 2217.62] he rose again from the dead.
[2217.94 → 2221.84] He ascended to the right hand of God the Father,
[2222.70 → 2226.44] and Jesus Christ is now enthroned on high.
[2226.44 → 2230.58] And so, even now, I want you to picture this.
[2230.70 → 2238.16] Even now, Jesus looks down upon us with sympathy and with love.
[2238.60 → 2243.38] And he measures upon us grace upon grace.
[2243.48 → 2245.22] He measures out grace upon grace.
[2245.64 → 2248.44] And he longs to provide the grace upon grace.
[2248.44 → 2251.90] And of his glorious resurrection.
[2252.40 → 2254.64] He longs to provide it for each one of us.
[2255.56 → 2262.22] Now, for those of us who do not yet know Jesus to be their life,
[2262.32 → 2263.62] their blessing, their way,
[2264.34 → 2266.98] we are so glad that you are here.
[2266.98 → 2275.00] And Jesus longs to show you what he does for those who are his own.
[2275.00 → 2282.08] But this meal is for those whose lives have been transformed by Jesus Christ.
[2282.70 → 2284.76] And if that is not yet you today,
[2284.84 → 2287.20] I would love to talk to you after the service
[2287.20 → 2292.26] about how you can also put your faith in Jesus in this way.
[2293.44 → 2296.20] But this meal is for the family of God,
[2296.26 → 2297.92] for his brothers and sisters,
[2298.54 → 2300.58] all those who put their trust in him,
[2300.90 → 2303.40] all of those who have been baptized in his name,
[2303.40 → 2306.80] and all of those who come repentantly.
[2308.64 → 2311.30] So the Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed,
[2311.42 → 2312.24] he took bread.
[2313.00 → 2314.20] And when he had given thanks,
[2314.26 → 2315.80] he broke it and said,
[2315.90 → 2317.66] this is my body, which is for you.
[2318.44 → 2321.58] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2322.38 → 2324.26] The same way also, after supper,
[2324.36 → 2326.08] he took the cup and said,
[2326.20 → 2328.64] this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[2328.64 → 2331.56] As often as you drink it,
[2331.56 → 2335.66] do it in remembrance of me.
[2336.36 → 2340.70] For as often as you eat this bread, and you drink the cup,
[2340.96 → 2345.54] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[2346.10 → 2348.02] Let's come to the Lord together in prayer
[2348.02 → 2350.54] as we prepare for this meal.
[2350.54 → 2355.34] O Lord Christ, we thank you that you have come.
[2356.40 → 2359.68] And from heaven on high, you have heard our cries.
[2360.38 → 2362.44] You have seen our struggle.
[2362.86 → 2364.92] You have remembered your covenant promises.
[2365.84 → 2367.40] And you have come down.
[2368.28 → 2371.58] And you have come down in humility to walk our way,
[2371.82 → 2373.60] to bear our sorrows,
[2373.78 → 2375.42] to die for our sin,
[2375.42 → 2377.10] and to rise,
[2377.88 → 2379.92] that we might ascend with you
[2379.92 → 2382.78] to the heights and the glories of heaven itself.
[2384.28 → 2386.20] Lord, we thank you that once again,
[2386.32 → 2387.40] you come now
[2387.40 → 2389.90] by your spirit
[2389.90 → 2391.32] to meet us.
[2392.10 → 2393.40] And we pray that
[2393.40 → 2395.22] by that same life-giving spirit,
[2395.22 → 2397.00] that you would take these elements
[2397.00 → 2398.60] of bread
[2398.60 → 2400.84] and this juice
[2400.84 → 2402.66] and that it would signify
[2402.66 → 2404.00] your goodness
[2404.00 → 2405.14] and your grace to us,
[2405.36 → 2407.88] that we might share more fully this day
[2407.88 → 2409.24] in your life
[2409.24 → 2410.80] and in your death.
[2411.44 → 2412.54] And so we pray, Lord,
[2412.64 → 2414.26] that your grace would be present
[2414.26 → 2415.02] and active
[2415.02 → 2416.22] and powerful
[2416.22 → 2417.40] in meeting us
[2417.40 → 2419.44] and transforming us.
[2420.04 → 2421.18] And we pray, Lord,
[2421.96 → 2423.30] that to you
[2423.30 → 2424.22] would be
[2424.22 → 2425.36] all the glory
[2425.36 → 2427.46] as we sit at your table
[2427.46 → 2430.14] and receive yet again
[2430.14 → 2430.76] the grace
[2430.76 → 2431.66] of your love.
[2431.66 → 2433.22] we pray this
[2433.22 → 2433.92] in Jesus' name.
[2434.16 → 2434.44] Amen.
[2436.12 → 2437.44] May I ask our elders
[2437.44 → 2437.94] and deacons
[2437.94 → 2438.48] who are serving
[2438.48 → 2439.70] to come forward
[2439.70 → 2441.18] and help me distribute
[2441.18 → 2441.74] the elements.
[2441.74 → 2443.74] So...
[2461.66 → 2470.58] need you...
[2471.06 → 2474.98] Lord,
[2474.98 → 2476.54] of you to...
[2476.54 → 2478.54] Amen.
[2506.54 → 2508.54] Amen.
[2536.54 → 2538.54] Amen.
[2566.54 → 2568.54] Amen.
[2596.54 → 2598.54] Amen.
[2626.54 → 2628.54] Amen.
[2656.54 → 2658.54] Amen.
[2686.54 → 2688.54] Amen.
[2716.54 → 2718.54] Amen.
[2746.54 → 2748.54] Amen.
[2776.54 → 2778.54] Amen.
[2806.54 → 2808.54] Amen.
[2836.54 → 2838.54] Amen.
[2866.54 → 2868.54] Amen.
[2868.54 → 2870.54] Amen.
[2870.54 → 2872.54] Amen.
[2872.54 → 2874.54] Amen.
[2874.54 → 2876.54] Amen.
[2876.54 → 2878.54] Amen.
[2878.54 → 2880.54] Amen.
[2880.54 → 2882.54] Amen.
[2888.54 → 2893.54] Brothers and sisters in the Lord, this is the blood of Christ shed for you.
[2893.54 → 2895.54] Let's drink together.
[2896.54 → 2897.54] Amen.
[2897.54 → 2898.54] Amen.
[2898.54 → 2899.54] Amen.
[2899.54 → 2900.54] Amen.
[2900.54 → 2901.54] Amen.
[2901.54 → 2902.54] Amen.
[2902.54 → 2903.54] Amen.
[2903.54 → 2904.54] Amen.
[2904.54 → 2905.54] Join me in prayer.
[2905.54 → 2914.54] Oh, Lord, we thank you for the mystery and the majesty of your great sacrifice for us.
[2914.54 → 2917.54] We thank you that in you, we have life.
[2917.54 → 2923.54] We thank you that you are the one who sacrificed yourself for the freedom of us all.
[2923.54 → 2924.54] And may Lord we always remember.
[2924.54 → 2925.54] And may Lord we always remember.
[2925.54 → 2929.54] And in remembering may we live accordingly.
[2929.54 → 2935.54] By your grace, with the help, the presence, and the power of your Holy Spirit in us, Lord.
[2935.54 → 2938.54] And we thank you for feeding us again at this table.
[2938.54 → 2939.54] We pray in Jesus name.
[2939.54 → 2940.54] Amen.
[2940.54 → 2941.54] Amen.
[2941.54 → 2942.54] Okay.
[2942.54 → 2943.54] Thank you.
[2943.54 → 2945.54] And now we did things out.
[2945.54 → 2955.54] I believe at this time we can send our Chinese brothers and sisters to their sermon and the children to their Sunday school classes.

[2976.06 → 2980.44] Ashley
[2980.44 → 3003.70] Good morning again.
[3004.34 → 3005.56] Let's open our Bibles.
[3006.30 → 3008.96] We've been going through the book of Romans together,
[3008.96 → 3011.90] and we are today in Romans chapter 2.
[3013.06 → 3017.14] And we'll be considering in Romans chapter 2, verses 17 to 29.
[3031.12 → 3035.58] That is on page 837 in your pew Bible, 837.
[3035.58 → 3038.04] We're in Romans chapter 2.
[3039.82 → 3043.40] We will finish the chapter, verses 17 to 29.
[3043.40 → 3047.46] Now you, if you call yourself a Jew,
[3048.18 → 3051.60] if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God,
[3052.16 → 3055.08] if you know his will and approve of what is superior,
[3055.76 → 3057.70] because you are instructed by the law,
[3058.30 → 3061.76] if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind,
[3062.04 → 3064.10] a light for those who are in the dark,
[3064.68 → 3069.26] an instructor of the foolish, a preacher, or sorry, a teacher of infants,
[3069.26 → 3073.88] because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,
[3074.66 → 3078.60] you then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself?
[3079.44 → 3083.22] You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
[3084.08 → 3088.78] You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
[3088.78 → 3093.18] You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
[3093.78 → 3097.22] You who brag about the law, do you dishonour God by breaking the law?
[3097.76 → 3103.64] As it is written, God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.
[3105.20 → 3107.58] Circumcision has value if you observe the law,
[3107.72 → 3112.56] but if you break the law, you have become as though you have not been circumcised.
[3112.56 → 3116.40] If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements,
[3116.72 → 3119.78] will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
[3120.42 → 3124.50] The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law
[3124.50 → 3129.12] will condemn you who, even though you have the written law,
[3129.88 → 3132.66] code, and circumcision are a lawbreaker.
[3133.64 → 3137.02] A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly,
[3137.56 → 3140.40] nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
[3140.40 → 3144.14] No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly,
[3144.64 → 3147.92] and circumcision is circumcision of the heart,
[3148.18 → 3151.26] by the spirit, not by the written code.
[3152.12 → 3156.12] Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.
[3157.20 → 3158.58] This is the word of the Lord.
[3159.68 → 3160.62] May you speak to God.
[3162.26 → 3164.98] Let's pray together and ask for God's blessing
[3164.98 → 3166.72] upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[3166.72 → 3171.22] O Lord, we thank you for your word,
[3171.32 → 3175.50] and it's always such a privilege to be together as your people.
[3176.46 → 3180.94] And we do not come together seeking out a God we do not know,
[3181.28 → 3184.46] but a God who has made himself known to us.
[3185.34 → 3189.40] So we ask, Lord, that you would open our hearts to hear your word,
[3189.40 → 3195.36] and through your word we create in our hearts a home for your presence,
[3196.08 → 3198.92] that we might live for the glory of our Father,
[3199.08 → 3201.44] for the kingdom of his beloved Son,
[3202.52 → 3204.94] through the Holy Spirit dwelling within us.
[3205.66 → 3207.28] In the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[3207.96 → 3208.32] Amen.
[3208.32 → 3208.42] Amen.
[3210.94 → 3213.96] I have a question for you this morning.
[3213.96 → 3219.00] Many of you will find this to be quite easy to answer.
[3220.04 → 3223.86] The question is, what nationality are you?
[3225.88 → 3227.42] What nationality are you?
[3230.80 → 3233.78] I've kind of felt recently it's not that easy for me to answer.
[3234.04 → 3235.90] On the one hand, I'm an American.
[3236.68 → 3237.74] I grew up in America.
[3237.94 → 3239.56] But what does that even mean?
[3239.56 → 3242.68] You know, America is such an immigrant country.
[3242.92 → 3245.06] It's, you know, known as a melting pot.
[3245.48 → 3248.72] People of different nationalities coming together.
[3249.24 → 3254.30] And so I wanted to learn more about my own immigrant history.
[3254.68 → 3254.84] Right?
[3254.90 → 3257.00] Where my ancestors came from.
[3257.90 → 3259.48] So I asked my mom.
[3259.58 → 3260.50] She just said, you're an American.
[3260.70 → 3260.88] Okay.
[3261.50 → 3262.02] Thanks.
[3262.94 → 3267.16] But now we have these DNA ancestry kits.
[3267.72 → 3268.70] Have you done with those?
[3268.70 → 3271.46] Now the Chinese government has all of our data.
[3272.40 → 3276.30] But, so I won't, it won't be a problem for me to share what I've learned.
[3276.86 → 3281.76] I have learned that I am 58% French.
[3282.90 → 3284.60] 10% British.
[3286.10 → 3287.82] You can cheer, you know, the different, you know.
[3289.62 → 3291.50] 16% Italian.
[3292.24 → 3293.46] Any Italians in the room?
[3294.36 → 3294.78] Okay.
[3294.78 → 3301.74] And to my surprise, I am 6% Ashkenazi Jewish.
[3303.22 → 3303.46] Hmm.
[3304.58 → 3305.54] What does that mean?
[3305.84 → 3306.38] I don't know.
[3306.46 → 3306.96] I Googled it.
[3307.46 → 3315.02] It means that I can trace my genetic roots back to the Jews who settled in Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages.
[3316.94 → 3317.98] Ashkenazi Jews.
[3317.98 → 3319.76] So, I'm 6% Jewish.
[3321.06 → 3322.76] Now, what nationality am I?
[3324.08 → 3324.52] American.
[3324.84 → 3325.28] Still.
[3325.58 → 3325.80] That's.
[3326.32 → 3328.76] But I've also applied for Canadian citizenship.
[3329.26 → 3330.48] And I've taken the test.
[3330.56 → 3332.20] I hope I will have that soon.
[3332.32 → 3334.22] And so then I'll be able to say, I am Canadian.
[3335.48 → 3335.84] Yeah.
[3337.48 → 3337.96] Yet.
[3338.96 → 3339.58] Thank you.
[3339.58 → 3342.12] It's not done yet.
[3342.28 → 3343.06] They may reject me.
[3343.16 → 3347.04] I don't know the mysteries of the inner workings of, you know, these things.
[3347.34 → 3354.40] But my point is, there is, though, only one nationality that really is important for all of us this morning.
[3355.34 → 3359.12] The question you have to ask yourself is, am I a Jew?
[3359.12 → 3372.12] Now, I'm not talking about being a Jew ethnically, whether it's 6% or, if that can be believed, or much more as a percentage of your DNA.
[3372.78 → 3376.50] I mean, are you a Jew spiritually?
[3377.58 → 3386.38] Because in our passage this morning, the Apostle Paul is saying that God has one people who are called the people of God.
[3386.38 → 3391.38] And it's not based on whether you are ethnically Jewish or not.
[3391.76 → 3397.42] But it's based on actually sharing one defining characteristic, one internal reality.
[3398.12 → 3402.70] And that is to be a person whose heart has been changed by God.
[3404.04 → 3408.24] And that has always been the defining characteristic of God's people.
[3408.56 → 3409.94] All the way from Adam.
[3410.82 → 3414.36] And all the way to the when Christ returns.
[3414.36 → 3418.36] And anyone who comes to faith in between.
[3420.36 → 3424.78] So again, our question this morning is, are you a Jew?
[3425.46 → 3429.06] And you need to be able to answer, yes.
[3430.50 → 3434.50] And I hope this morning you will understand why and why that's so important.
[3434.50 → 3446.68] So Paul is writing this letter to the Romans to the church in Rome, which is made up of both Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians.
[3447.36 → 3454.44] And what Paul has been doing over the last chapter, really, through this very extended argument,
[3454.44 → 3459.44] is to say that on the day of judgment, God will show no partiality.
[3460.44 → 3462.46] He will show no favouritism.
[3463.06 → 3467.48] It doesn't matter what your perceived status is before God.
[3467.70 → 3471.06] You still will not escape God's judgment.
[3472.18 → 3473.90] God will judge everyone.
[3473.90 → 3479.34] And now this is where the Jews would have started to get confused.
[3479.98 → 3482.30] They would have said, wait just a minute.
[3483.12 → 3485.38] Aren't we God's chosen people?
[3486.24 → 3486.48] Right?
[3486.58 → 3488.54] Aren't we God's special people?
[3488.54 → 3497.30] And, you know, if we think about in the Gospels, the times when Jesus was interacting with the Pharisees and the other Jewish leaders,
[3497.78 → 3506.40] they would often appeal to their own ancestry as a way to defend their spiritual standing with God.
[3507.22 → 3507.74] Right?
[3507.80 → 3513.64] And so Jesus, at one point in a conversation with them, they say, we are descendants of Moses.
[3514.40 → 3518.26] We don't know who you are, but we know who we are.
[3519.20 → 3523.54] And what they're saying is, what matters is my lineage.
[3524.12 → 3525.22] We are children of Abraham.
[3526.42 → 3530.68] And in our text today, Paul's basically saying, I don't really care.
[3531.66 → 3537.42] Because if you are merely, outwardly a Jew, you are not a Jew at all.
[3538.28 → 3544.72] And he's trying to show these Jewish Christians in the church, like last week we saw how he's kind of talking to the Gentiles.
[3544.72 → 3550.66] And they can't stand before God based on following the law that they know.
[3551.52 → 3553.14] But here he's turning to the Jews.
[3553.26 → 3554.52] He's trying to level the playing field.
[3554.62 → 3557.58] And he says, there is no special favouritism for you.
[3557.58 → 3565.96] And that what gives us actually a standing before God is not the outward markers of the law or circumcision,
[3566.60 → 3571.26] but being a Jew inwardly by the heart, in the heart by the spirit.
[3571.26 → 3574.00] So that's what we're going to look at this morning.
[3574.24 → 3582.26] And we're going to first look at the two ways that the Jews were trusting in their religiosity as a basis for their standing before God.
[3582.26 → 3588.32] And then we're actually going to see what does make us secure before God.
[3589.22 → 3598.54] Okay, so first, the first way that the Jews were trying to exclude themselves from God's judgment was by their conformity to the law.
[3598.78 → 3601.46] So let's look at that in verses 17 and 18.
[3601.46 → 3605.64] Now you, if you call yourself a Jew, right?
[3605.72 → 3606.68] So he's talking to the Jews.
[3607.24 → 3615.96] If you rely on the law and boast in God, if you know his will and approve of what is superior, because you are instructed by the law.
[3617.48 → 3623.72] So Paul here is affirming that the law is very good.
[3623.72 → 3631.68] Through the law, God taught his people what his will is, how to live as his people.
[3632.34 → 3639.60] And so having God's word in the midst of a Gentile world was a beautiful blessing that God had given his people.
[3640.88 → 3646.50] Then he goes on, not only that, but in verse 19, he goes on to say,
[3646.50 → 3655.26] If you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children,
[3655.82 → 3660.16] because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth.
[3661.36 → 3669.46] So Paul here is affirming not only the blessing of having the law, but that in fact the Jews saw themselves as a light to the world.
[3669.82 → 3672.44] That was their calling in their vocation.
[3672.44 → 3679.48] And so they would welcome strangers to come into the synagogues, to hear, to be instructed by the law,
[3679.64 → 3682.88] that they might know and worship the one true and living God.
[3684.00 → 3684.84] And you know what?
[3684.90 → 3694.20] Today we would use many of these same words and description that Paul writes here to describe the treasure,
[3694.92 → 3698.04] the blessing that we have in the word of God.
[3700.52 → 3702.08] But, there's a bit.
[3702.44 → 3709.30] Paul then, he asked them, so he says, all of this is true, all of this is good,
[3710.30 → 3712.80] but then he asked them some penetrating questions.
[3714.08 → 3716.30] He continues in verse 21.
[3716.88 → 3720.64] You then, who teach others, do you teach yourself?
[3721.84 → 3724.54] You then, who preach against stealing, do you steal?
[3725.54 → 3729.40] You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
[3729.40 → 3732.66] You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
[3734.66 → 3736.42] And the next slide.
[3736.42 → 3737.42] You who boast in the law.
[3737.42 → 3738.52] You who boast in the law.
[3738.52 → 3743.32] Do you dishonour God by breaking the law?
[3743.32 → 3752.70] And as the listeners of Paul's letter, or the readers of Paul's letter,
[3752.80 → 3756.32] as they listen to these questions and as they answer these questions,
[3756.68 → 3761.80] if they are honestly searching their hearts, the answer is yes.
[3761.80 → 3767.72] There are, admittedly, times when I do these things.
[3768.82 → 3772.44] Now, the Jewish Christians likely were not literally robbing temples,
[3773.06 → 3777.12] or stealing, or being sexually immoral.
[3777.12 → 3782.74] Now, of course, it's possible some of them were actually doing these things,
[3782.90 → 3787.98] but it's more likely that Paul is naming these inconsistencies not just in their actions,
[3788.10 → 3790.30] but actually also in their hearts, right?
[3790.38 → 3794.60] Such as lusting in their hearts, or being idolaters in their hearts,
[3794.74 → 3800.16] trusting in things other than the true God for their sense of who they are.
[3800.94 → 3803.84] And this is the same that Jesus does in the Sermon on the Mount.
[3803.84 → 3810.70] And Paul's point is to say there is a problem of hypocrisy in everyone's life
[3810.70 → 3813.84] who strives to obey the law of God.
[3814.36 → 3818.84] This is a problem that all of us face, that we have the law, we have God's word.
[3819.52 → 3823.24] It instructs us in the will and the ways of God we are to live it out,
[3823.80 → 3827.94] and yet there's a sense of hypocrisy because what we believe and say
[3827.94 → 3831.64] doesn't always match up with what is in our hearts
[3831.64 → 3833.96] and sometimes what is in our actions.
[3835.40 → 3842.02] And so Paul teaches that even though you boast in God by having the law,
[3842.08 → 3846.40] by teaching it to others, you dishonour him by breaking it.
[3847.98 → 3853.74] And when you do that, you dishonour, or you damage your witness in the world.
[3853.78 → 3855.46] And that's what he says in verse 24.
[3855.46 → 3861.96] As it is written, God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.
[3864.58 → 3868.24] And unfortunately, the same could be said of the church, can't it?
[3869.50 → 3874.38] When we who have the word of God do not always live it out.
[3875.18 → 3879.04] It damages our witness in the world.
[3879.04 → 3887.78] But when we see the matter in this way, the question for us is,
[3888.92 → 3893.40] are these sins evident in my heart?
[3895.00 → 3899.38] Are these sins that Paul mentioned, stealing and idolatry and adultery,
[3899.46 → 3903.40] all these things, are they evident in my life, in my actions, in my heart?
[3903.40 → 3909.46] Is my life in any way bringing dishonour on God and marring my witness?
[3910.10 → 3912.46] That's something we all need to ask ourselves.
[3913.26 → 3915.68] And I was painfully reminded of this recently
[3915.68 → 3919.62] because I personally know two pastors
[3919.62 → 3926.94] who have in the last month had their ordinations taken away for egregious sins.
[3926.94 → 3932.54] And those outward sins that they were caught in
[3932.54 → 3935.52] didn't just come out overnight.
[3936.38 → 3938.34] They were sins that began in the heart,
[3938.92 → 3943.20] that were unseen, that were unnoticed, that were unrepented of,
[3944.24 → 3950.38] and then carried out in their actions in real hypocrisy
[3950.38 → 3954.50] that damaged their witness to who God is.
[3954.50 → 3957.52] And so let us take warning today
[3957.52 → 3960.66] not just to be people like the Jews
[3960.66 → 3961.42] who can say,
[3961.94 → 3963.48] well, I call myself a Christian,
[3963.74 → 3965.16] and I rely on God's word,
[3965.32 → 3966.44] and I boast in God,
[3966.64 → 3967.70] and I know his will,
[3968.06 → 3969.40] and approve what is good
[3969.40 → 3971.54] because I was instructed from his word.
[3973.72 → 3973.96] Right?
[3974.04 → 3976.48] May we not gain a false sense of security
[3976.48 → 3977.62] that we are saved
[3977.62 → 3980.12] because we know the right things.
[3981.22 → 3981.70] Absolutely.
[3982.02 → 3983.34] We want to know the Bible.
[3983.34 → 3987.10] We want to be instructed in the truth of God's word,
[3987.30 → 3991.26] but it is not something that you, or I can rely on,
[3991.36 → 3992.32] just having it,
[3992.44 → 3994.00] for our standing before God.
[3995.44 → 3998.50] And Paul is giving this as a message to the Jews
[3998.50 → 4000.36] in Rome in the first century,
[4000.56 → 4002.72] but we need to hear it today.
[4003.78 → 4003.98] Right?
[4004.06 → 4004.98] We must know
[4004.98 → 4006.96] that having God's word,
[4007.10 → 4007.42] the Bible,
[4007.54 → 4009.70] is not going to shield us either
[4009.70 → 4014.10] because we also are guilty of hypocrisy
[4014.10 → 4016.04] in our hearts,
[4016.54 → 4017.72] in our actions.
[4018.80 → 4019.24] Therefore,
[4019.46 → 4022.34] it can never deal with God's wrath against our sin.
[4022.76 → 4024.48] We can never rely on it.
[4024.58 → 4026.10] Only the good news of Jesus,
[4026.96 → 4028.84] him being our judge,
[4029.34 → 4030.28] and our Saviour,
[4030.46 → 4032.32] can help us on that day of judgment.
[4032.32 → 4033.76] Okay,
[4033.82 → 4034.46] but next,
[4034.56 → 4035.18] he moves on.
[4035.78 → 4037.92] There's not only one thing
[4037.92 → 4039.08] that the Jews were relying on,
[4039.14 → 4040.04] but there's a second thing.
[4040.50 → 4041.96] The second way that the Jews,
[4042.10 → 4042.74] in Paul's day,
[4042.82 → 4044.40] were trying to exclude themselves
[4044.40 → 4046.14] from God's judgment
[4046.14 → 4047.00] was
[4047.00 → 4049.32] by claiming circumcision.
[4050.32 → 4051.90] So look with me at verse 25.
[4052.46 → 4053.66] Circumcision has value
[4053.66 → 4054.78] if you observe the law,
[4054.78 → 4056.62] but if you break the law,
[4056.84 → 4057.54] you have become
[4057.54 → 4058.12] as though
[4058.12 → 4060.38] you had not been circumcised.
[4063.06 → 4065.30] This was a shocking
[4065.30 → 4068.24] thing for Paul to say to them.
[4069.28 → 4071.98] An insulting thing for him to say.
[4072.28 → 4074.86] Imagine the explosive effect
[4074.86 → 4076.90] that had on the Jews
[4076.90 → 4077.50] who were listening
[4077.50 → 4078.82] because he is saying
[4078.82 → 4080.22] you can lose
[4080.22 → 4081.64] your covenant status.
[4082.76 → 4083.38] That's what he's saying.
[4084.78 → 4085.98] And that's what circumcision
[4085.98 → 4086.82] was all about.
[4087.02 → 4087.90] The covenant status
[4087.90 → 4088.52] of God's people.
[4089.50 → 4090.92] So as many of you know,
[4091.06 → 4092.12] circumcision was given
[4092.12 → 4093.36] by God to Abraham
[4093.36 → 4095.28] many, many years ago.
[4095.42 → 4096.72] And it was a sign
[4096.72 → 4098.04] given by God
[4098.04 → 4099.96] of God's special relationship
[4099.96 → 4101.10] with Abraham
[4101.10 → 4101.90] and his offspring.
[4103.16 → 4103.82] And so the covenant
[4103.82 → 4105.00] that God made with Abraham
[4105.00 → 4106.62] was in short to say,
[4107.64 → 4108.70] I am your God.
[4109.00 → 4110.32] You are my people.
[4110.66 → 4112.28] So live like this.
[4113.10 → 4114.36] That was the relationship.
[4114.78 → 4116.40] I will be your God,
[4116.54 → 4117.20] not the gods
[4117.20 → 4117.88] of the other nations.
[4118.16 → 4118.84] I am the God.
[4119.30 → 4120.34] You will worship me alone.
[4121.48 → 4122.74] You will be my people
[4122.74 → 4124.30] special in all the world.
[4124.80 → 4126.74] And through you,
[4126.94 → 4128.98] my blessings will go out
[4128.98 → 4129.74] to all the world
[4129.74 → 4130.78] and you will live
[4130.78 → 4131.82] according to my ways.
[4133.00 → 4134.84] And circumcision was a sign
[4134.84 → 4136.98] meant, as a sign,
[4137.06 → 4137.76] it meant that God
[4137.76 → 4139.48] was cutting off Abraham
[4139.48 → 4140.56] and his descendants
[4140.56 → 4142.62] from all the nations
[4142.62 → 4143.16] of the world.
[4143.76 → 4145.22] He was setting them apart
[4145.22 → 4147.44] as his people,
[4148.20 → 4148.90] right, through whom
[4148.90 → 4149.54] he would bring
[4149.54 → 4150.86] his blessing to the world.
[4151.30 → 4152.06] And so circumcision
[4152.06 → 4153.36] was a sign and a seal
[4153.36 → 4155.58] of that covenant relationship
[4155.58 → 4157.00] that they had with God.
[4157.62 → 4158.74] And it represented
[4158.74 → 4160.26] God's promises
[4160.26 → 4161.80] and his blessings to them
[4161.80 → 4165.22] as well as curses
[4165.22 → 4166.62] for disobedience
[4166.62 → 4168.92] and covenant breaking.
[4170.30 → 4171.84] So what is the problem
[4171.84 → 4172.70] with circumcision?
[4173.98 → 4175.76] Well, there isn't any problem
[4175.76 → 4177.24] if you obey the law.
[4178.14 → 4179.74] But if you break the law,
[4180.08 → 4180.82] your circumcision
[4180.82 → 4182.28] becomes uncircumcision.
[4182.70 → 4183.50] And that's what Paul
[4183.50 → 4184.76] is reminding them of.
[4185.74 → 4186.64] Here's an example.
[4187.60 → 4188.04] Imagine,
[4188.94 → 4189.86] well, you don't have to imagine.
[4190.06 → 4191.24] I have a wedding band.
[4191.56 → 4192.58] Some of you have this, right?
[4193.30 → 4193.58] Yes.
[4195.34 → 4196.72] Imagine me as a man.
[4196.80 → 4197.64] I say to myself,
[4197.98 → 4199.28] see, I am married.
[4200.00 → 4201.22] I am in covenant
[4201.22 → 4202.20] with my wife.
[4202.74 → 4203.56] So even
[4203.56 → 4205.26] if I am unfaithful
[4205.26 → 4205.98] to my wife
[4205.98 → 4207.26] and go after other women,
[4207.90 → 4208.78] don't worry,
[4209.00 → 4209.86] I've got this.
[4211.22 → 4212.44] Is that how it works?
[4213.62 → 4214.06] No.
[4214.62 → 4215.76] It's not how it works.
[4216.30 → 4216.96] The wedding band
[4216.96 → 4217.88] is a sign
[4217.88 → 4219.62] of the marriage relationship.
[4219.90 → 4221.38] But if I or anybody else
[4221.38 → 4221.98] who's married
[4221.98 → 4223.38] is unfaithful
[4223.38 → 4224.14] to our spouses,
[4224.80 → 4225.78] does this ring
[4225.78 → 4226.38] mean anything?
[4228.44 → 4228.92] No.
[4229.30 → 4230.28] The answer is no.
[4230.28 → 4232.20] The sign becomes meaningless.
[4232.86 → 4233.42] It's invalid
[4233.42 → 4235.18] because the reality
[4235.18 → 4235.98] of your life
[4235.98 → 4236.68] does not reflect
[4236.68 → 4237.58] what is contained
[4237.58 → 4238.74] in the meaning
[4238.74 → 4240.04] of the ring.
[4241.16 → 4241.90] And that's what Paul
[4241.90 → 4242.70] is saying here
[4242.70 → 4243.26] about the sign
[4243.26 → 4243.92] of circumcision.
[4244.28 → 4244.92] If a Jew
[4244.92 → 4245.50] who by birth
[4245.50 → 4246.48] has circumcision
[4246.48 → 4247.94] but then breaks
[4247.94 → 4248.56] the law,
[4248.56 → 4251.26] he shows himself
[4251.26 → 4252.92] to not truly
[4252.92 → 4254.50] be God's people.
[4255.20 → 4255.88] The sign
[4255.88 → 4257.62] becomes meaningless.
[4258.96 → 4259.84] But the Jews
[4259.84 → 4260.78] had come to see
[4260.78 → 4262.02] the sign
[4262.02 → 4262.78] of circumcision
[4262.78 → 4264.72] not as conditional
[4264.72 → 4266.84] upon their obedience,
[4266.98 → 4267.92] not just as a sign
[4267.92 → 4268.68] of their relationship
[4268.68 → 4269.28] with God,
[4269.58 → 4270.66] but as a guarantee
[4270.66 → 4272.68] of their status
[4272.68 → 4273.46] before God.
[4274.04 → 4274.92] And Paul is saying,
[4275.36 → 4275.56] no.
[4276.38 → 4277.52] That's not how it works.
[4278.56 → 4279.62] And he drives
[4279.62 → 4280.56] home that point
[4280.56 → 4281.64] as well
[4281.64 → 4282.62] in verse 26
[4282.62 → 4284.40] where he says,
[4284.92 → 4285.44] so then
[4285.44 → 4286.12] if those
[4286.12 → 4286.82] who are not
[4286.82 → 4287.70] circumcised,
[4287.78 → 4288.42] right, Gentiles,
[4288.68 → 4289.62] if they keep
[4289.62 → 4290.58] the law's requirements,
[4290.72 → 4291.40] will they not
[4291.40 → 4291.98] be regarded
[4291.98 → 4292.42] as though
[4292.42 → 4293.66] they were circumcised?
[4294.60 → 4295.38] It's a hypothetical
[4295.38 → 4295.84] question.
[4295.92 → 4296.52] The answer is yes,
[4296.56 → 4297.08] they would be.
[4298.20 → 4298.40] Right?
[4298.46 → 4299.18] If a Gentile
[4299.18 → 4300.58] keeps the law,
[4301.52 → 4302.74] worships God
[4302.74 → 4303.46] truly,
[4303.80 → 4304.34] hypothetically,
[4305.30 → 4306.12] they're actually
[4306.12 → 4306.94] doing
[4306.94 → 4308.28] what circumcision
[4308.28 → 4309.32] is a sign
[4309.32 → 4309.76] of,
[4310.24 → 4310.84] which is being
[4310.84 → 4312.04] joined to God
[4312.04 → 4312.58] and being
[4312.58 → 4313.30] in relationship
[4313.30 → 4313.86] with him.
[4315.16 → 4315.96] So it's not about
[4315.96 → 4317.12] having the sign,
[4317.32 → 4318.02] it's about
[4318.02 → 4318.86] what is true.
[4319.52 → 4320.34] What is actually
[4320.34 → 4321.08] true in your
[4321.08 → 4321.56] relationship
[4321.56 → 4322.46] with God?
[4322.58 → 4323.54] What is the reality
[4323.54 → 4325.12] of our lives?
[4327.12 → 4327.94] And you know,
[4328.02 → 4328.68] God is speaking
[4328.68 → 4329.90] here to us as well.
[4329.90 → 4331.76] because in the
[4331.76 → 4332.34] New Testament,
[4332.86 → 4333.98] baptism has
[4333.98 → 4335.34] replaced circumcision
[4335.34 → 4336.48] as a sign
[4336.48 → 4337.60] of God's covenant.
[4338.92 → 4339.48] And so this
[4339.48 → 4340.36] applies to us
[4340.36 → 4341.72] because, you know,
[4341.78 → 4342.42] maybe you were
[4342.42 → 4343.30] baptized in the
[4343.30 → 4343.68] church.
[4345.14 → 4345.94] Maybe, like some
[4345.94 → 4346.62] of you today,
[4347.46 → 4348.42] you are a member.
[4348.84 → 4349.34] You have become
[4349.34 → 4350.00] a member of the
[4350.00 → 4350.36] church.
[4351.34 → 4351.84] And then it's
[4351.84 → 4353.10] very easy to rely
[4353.10 → 4353.88] on that fact
[4353.88 → 4354.32] and to say,
[4354.46 → 4355.10] well, God
[4355.10 → 4355.72] would never judge
[4355.72 → 4356.04] me.
[4356.56 → 4357.00] I have been
[4357.00 → 4357.32] baptized.
[4357.32 → 4360.00] or I've
[4360.00 → 4360.64] worshipped here
[4360.64 → 4361.40] for years.
[4362.18 → 4362.98] I'm a member
[4362.98 → 4363.92] of this church.
[4365.68 → 4366.70] You could say,
[4366.84 → 4367.84] I was baptized
[4367.84 → 4368.92] and Paul would
[4368.92 → 4369.68] say, that's
[4369.68 → 4370.06] great.
[4370.64 → 4371.22] You will be
[4371.22 → 4371.54] judged.
[4373.90 → 4374.78] You could say,
[4374.88 → 4375.64] my grandmother
[4375.64 → 4376.72] was a missionary
[4376.72 → 4378.24] and Paul would
[4378.24 → 4378.82] say, that is
[4378.82 → 4379.32] wonderful.
[4379.50 → 4380.14] Praise God.
[4380.38 → 4380.88] You will be
[4380.88 → 4381.24] judged.
[4383.48 → 4384.24] Because none
[4384.24 → 4384.82] of these things
[4384.82 → 4385.72] actually saves
[4385.72 → 4386.02] you.
[4386.02 → 4387.92] only relying
[4387.92 → 4388.46] on Jesus
[4388.46 → 4389.24] by faith
[4389.24 → 4389.90] can help
[4389.90 → 4390.72] us on
[4390.72 → 4391.28] that day.
[4392.72 → 4393.22] And that
[4393.22 → 4393.64] brings us
[4393.64 → 4394.28] to the final
[4394.28 → 4394.72] point this
[4394.72 → 4394.96] morning,
[4395.06 → 4395.84] this invitation
[4395.84 → 4396.30] of this
[4396.30 → 4396.86] passage,
[4397.16 → 4397.66] which is
[4397.66 → 4398.02] to the
[4398.02 → 4399.04] inner reality
[4399.04 → 4399.74] of having
[4399.74 → 4400.28] a changed
[4400.28 → 4400.58] heart.
[4401.52 → 4402.16] So let's
[4402.16 → 4402.42] look at
[4402.42 → 4403.52] this beautiful,
[4403.68 → 4404.08] extraordinary
[4404.08 → 4405.08] way that
[4405.08 → 4405.56] this passage
[4405.56 → 4406.50] ends in
[4406.50 → 4407.68] verses 28
[4407.68 → 4408.34] and 29.
[4408.72 → 4409.46] Because here,
[4409.56 → 4410.04] Paul really
[4410.04 → 4411.10] is redefining
[4411.10 → 4412.06] what it means
[4412.06 → 4413.28] to be a
[4413.28 → 4413.48] Jew.
[4414.40 → 4415.04] He says,
[4415.04 → 4415.60] a person
[4415.60 → 4416.10] is not
[4416.10 → 4416.56] a Jew
[4416.56 → 4417.26] who is
[4417.26 → 4418.38] one only
[4418.38 → 4419.26] outwardly,
[4419.62 → 4420.22] nor is
[4420.22 → 4420.82] circumcision
[4420.82 → 4422.06] merely outward
[4422.06 → 4422.74] and physical.
[4424.36 → 4425.08] Keep going.
[4425.52 → 4425.76] No,
[4425.88 → 4426.38] a person
[4426.38 → 4427.22] is a Jew
[4427.22 → 4428.52] who is
[4428.52 → 4429.40] one inwardly.
[4430.08 → 4430.80] And circumcision
[4430.80 → 4431.54] is circumcision
[4431.54 → 4432.42] of the heart
[4432.42 → 4433.40] by the spirit,
[4433.52 → 4434.02] not by the
[4434.02 → 4434.62] written code.
[4435.02 → 4435.72] Such a person's
[4435.72 → 4436.30] praise is not
[4436.30 → 4436.68] from other
[4436.68 → 4436.96] people,
[4437.04 → 4437.30] but from
[4437.30 → 4437.64] God.
[4439.00 → 4439.38] Right?
[4439.42 → 4439.62] And this
[4439.62 → 4440.14] is wonderful.
[4440.14 → 4441.82] Paul is
[4441.82 → 4442.46] saying that
[4442.46 → 4444.06] there actually
[4444.06 → 4444.94] is no such
[4444.94 → 4445.52] thing as a
[4445.52 → 4446.20] Jew who
[4446.20 → 4447.26] is only
[4447.26 → 4448.66] outwardly
[4448.66 → 4449.00] a Jew.
[4450.32 → 4451.12] A Jew,
[4451.34 → 4451.74] according to
[4451.74 → 4451.96] Paul,
[4452.02 → 4452.48] is someone
[4452.48 → 4453.46] who is
[4453.46 → 4454.12] inwardly
[4454.12 → 4454.48] a Jew.
[4455.40 → 4456.20] Having the
[4456.20 → 4456.54] law,
[4457.36 → 4457.70] having
[4457.70 → 4458.44] circumcision,
[4458.70 → 4459.14] these were
[4459.14 → 4460.12] good things,
[4460.48 → 4461.10] but they were
[4461.10 → 4461.90] never simply
[4461.90 → 4462.76] to be a
[4462.76 → 4463.96] national badge
[4463.96 → 4464.92] for Israel
[4464.92 → 4465.54] to say,
[4465.66 → 4465.72] well,
[4465.76 → 4466.42] we're Israelites.
[4466.42 → 4467.94] It was
[4467.94 → 4468.54] always
[4468.54 → 4469.36] to be
[4469.36 → 4469.78] paired
[4469.78 → 4470.44] with a
[4470.44 → 4471.14] spiritual
[4471.14 → 4471.78] reality.
[4473.42 → 4473.56] Those
[4473.56 → 4474.46] outside
[4474.46 → 4475.08] things
[4475.08 → 4475.42] were to
[4475.42 → 4475.60] be
[4475.60 → 4476.08] signs
[4476.08 → 4476.22] and
[4476.22 → 4476.78] reminders
[4476.78 → 4477.36] to them
[4477.36 → 4477.76] of their
[4477.76 → 4478.20] relationship
[4478.20 → 4478.80] with God.
[4478.98 → 4479.44] But what
[4479.44 → 4480.02] matters
[4480.02 → 4480.62] is not
[4480.62 → 4481.06] the outside
[4481.06 → 4481.54] things,
[4481.66 → 4482.12] but the
[4482.12 → 4482.82] internal
[4482.82 → 4483.56] reality.
[4484.24 → 4484.58] Let me
[4484.58 → 4484.96] just show
[4484.96 → 4485.48] you one
[4485.48 → 4486.26] place in
[4486.26 → 4486.56] the Old
[4486.56 → 4486.92] Testament
[4486.92 → 4487.68] where we
[4487.68 → 4488.28] see this.
[4488.68 → 4488.82] Okay?
[4488.92 → 4489.46] So look
[4489.46 → 4489.76] with me
[4489.76 → 4490.46] at Deuteronomy
[4490.46 → 4491.46] chapter 30
[4491.46 → 4492.12] verse 6.
[4493.74 → 4494.18] The Lord
[4494.18 → 4494.80] your God
[4494.80 → 4496.00] will circumcise
[4496.00 → 4496.96] your hearts
[4496.96 → 4498.04] and the
[4498.04 → 4498.42] hearts
[4498.42 → 4498.80] of your
[4498.80 → 4499.24] descendants
[4499.24 → 4500.34] so that
[4500.34 → 4500.82] you may
[4500.82 → 4501.54] love him
[4501.54 → 4501.82] with all
[4501.82 → 4502.00] of your
[4502.00 → 4502.36] heart
[4502.36 → 4502.86] and with
[4502.86 → 4503.20] all of
[4503.20 → 4503.72] your soul
[4503.72 → 4504.86] and live.
[4506.62 → 4507.36] The Lord
[4507.36 → 4507.68] your God
[4507.68 → 4508.68] will circumcise
[4508.68 → 4509.64] what?
[4511.24 → 4511.72] Your
[4511.72 → 4512.24] hearts.
[4513.82 → 4514.32] See,
[4514.40 → 4514.92] for Israel
[4514.92 → 4515.26] it was
[4515.26 → 4515.80] always a
[4515.80 → 4516.18] matter of
[4516.18 → 4516.58] the heart.
[4517.48 → 4518.14] And that's
[4518.14 → 4518.54] what Paul
[4518.54 → 4519.04] is saying
[4519.04 → 4519.54] here as
[4519.54 → 4519.76] well,
[4519.86 → 4520.66] that circumcision
[4520.66 → 4521.68] is circumcision
[4521.68 → 4523.38] of the
[4523.38 → 4523.76] heart.
[4525.32 → 4525.80] Ultimately,
[4526.00 → 4526.54] that is
[4526.54 → 4527.24] what distinguishes
[4527.24 → 4527.84] a true
[4527.84 → 4528.70] child of
[4528.70 → 4528.98] God.
[4529.40 → 4529.86] So what
[4529.86 → 4530.14] Paul is
[4530.14 → 4530.50] saying is
[4530.50 → 4530.98] we all
[4530.98 → 4531.18] need
[4531.18 → 4531.40] heart
[4531.40 → 4531.80] surgery.
[4533.16 → 4533.64] To truly
[4533.64 → 4536.86] be a
[4536.86 → 4537.42] man or
[4537.42 → 4537.78] a woman
[4537.78 → 4538.20] or a
[4538.20 → 4538.96] child of
[4538.96 → 4539.36] God
[4539.36 → 4540.14] is a
[4540.14 → 4540.40] matter
[4540.40 → 4541.04] of the
[4541.04 → 4541.38] heart.
[4541.52 → 4541.92] Where he
[4541.92 → 4542.46] gives you
[4542.46 → 4542.80] the Holy
[4542.80 → 4543.14] Spirit
[4543.14 → 4543.94] to make
[4543.94 → 4544.54] you alive
[4544.54 → 4545.18] to God
[4545.18 → 4546.00] so that
[4546.00 → 4546.28] you might
[4546.28 → 4546.80] love him
[4546.80 → 4547.12] with all
[4547.12 → 4547.30] of your
[4547.30 → 4547.52] heart
[4547.52 → 4547.98] and soul
[4547.98 → 4548.82] and live.
[4550.30 → 4551.08] So how
[4551.08 → 4551.56] do you
[4551.56 → 4552.06] know
[4552.06 → 4553.28] that this
[4553.28 → 4553.68] work of
[4553.68 → 4554.08] the Spirit
[4554.08 → 4554.88] has taken
[4554.88 → 4555.48] place in
[4555.48 → 4556.02] your life?
[4557.16 → 4557.70] You can
[4557.70 → 4558.10] know by
[4558.10 → 4558.84] evaluating
[4558.84 → 4559.82] where your
[4559.82 → 4560.78] faith lies.
[4561.76 → 4562.34] Is your
[4562.34 → 4563.08] faith in
[4563.08 → 4563.52] yourself?
[4564.36 → 4564.94] Is your
[4564.94 → 4565.40] faith in
[4565.40 → 4566.44] your morality
[4566.44 → 4567.86] how good
[4567.86 → 4568.80] you are?
[4569.80 → 4570.44] Is your
[4570.44 → 4570.94] faith in
[4570.94 → 4571.64] your baptism
[4571.64 → 4574.02] or having
[4574.02 → 4574.74] been raised
[4574.74 → 4575.20] in the
[4575.20 → 4576.64] church or
[4576.64 → 4577.16] that your
[4577.16 → 4577.72] grandmother
[4577.72 → 4579.60] helped start
[4579.60 → 4580.16] the church
[4580.16 → 4580.80] or was a
[4580.80 → 4581.88] missionary or
[4581.88 → 4583.34] anything or
[4583.34 → 4583.78] is it
[4583.78 → 4584.22] Christ?
[4585.12 → 4585.54] Do you
[4585.54 → 4585.96] believe that
[4585.96 → 4586.82] Jesus lived
[4586.82 → 4587.30] a perfect
[4587.30 → 4587.74] life?
[4588.10 → 4588.54] He died
[4588.54 → 4589.02] a death
[4589.02 → 4589.34] that you
[4589.34 → 4589.90] deserve to
[4589.90 → 4590.56] die and
[4590.56 → 4591.52] rose to
[4591.52 → 4592.02] newness of
[4592.02 → 4592.36] life.
[4592.76 → 4593.14] Is that
[4593.14 → 4593.72] where you
[4593.72 → 4594.10] see your
[4594.10 → 4594.54] salvation?
[4595.50 → 4596.06] That you
[4596.06 → 4596.78] have a
[4596.78 → 4597.48] secure standing
[4597.48 → 4598.28] before God
[4598.28 → 4598.60] on that
[4598.60 → 4598.84] day of
[4598.84 → 4599.12] judgment
[4599.12 → 4599.90] because you
[4599.90 → 4600.30] stand
[4600.30 → 4600.96] united
[4600.96 → 4602.36] to Christ
[4602.36 → 4603.32] and his
[4603.32 → 4604.02] righteousness
[4604.02 → 4605.44] is yours.
[4606.84 → 4607.96] Because if
[4607.96 → 4608.20] you are
[4608.20 → 4608.84] trusting in
[4608.84 → 4609.50] Jesus alone
[4609.50 → 4609.88] for your
[4609.88 → 4610.34] status,
[4610.46 → 4610.88] you're standing
[4610.88 → 4611.62] before God,
[4611.62 → 4612.60] that is
[4612.60 → 4613.78] evidence that
[4613.78 → 4614.22] the Spirit
[4614.22 → 4615.62] of God is
[4615.62 → 4616.26] working in
[4616.26 → 4616.48] you.
[4617.46 → 4617.88] And it's a
[4617.88 → 4618.48] beautiful thing.
[4620.28 → 4621.10] So we come
[4621.10 → 4621.54] back to the
[4621.54 → 4622.10] question that we
[4622.10 → 4622.72] started with.
[4623.52 → 4624.42] Are you a
[4624.42 → 4624.56] Jew?
[4626.60 → 4627.38] Can you say
[4627.38 → 4627.70] yes?
[4630.36 → 4631.54] Are you one
[4631.54 → 4632.40] who by the
[4632.40 → 4633.20] Spirit worships
[4633.20 → 4633.48] God?
[4634.34 → 4635.06] Are you one
[4635.06 → 4635.54] who by the
[4635.54 → 4636.34] Spirit has
[4636.34 → 4636.76] had your
[4636.76 → 4637.54] heart changed?
[4638.26 → 4638.96] Are you one
[4638.96 → 4639.52] who by the
[4639.52 → 4640.36] Spirit has
[4640.36 → 4641.02] been healed
[4641.02 → 4641.76] by God
[4641.76 → 4642.44] and who
[4642.44 → 4643.08] lives for
[4643.08 → 4643.78] God by
[4643.78 → 4644.32] his grace?
[4645.66 → 4646.20] Then you
[4646.20 → 4646.42] are a
[4646.42 → 4646.74] child of
[4646.74 → 4646.96] God.
[4647.90 → 4648.08] Okay,
[4648.12 → 4648.52] let's pray.
[4652.30 → 4652.76] Heavenly
[4652.76 → 4653.10] Father,
[4653.24 → 4653.90] these questions
[4653.90 → 4654.66] are important
[4654.66 → 4655.38] for us to
[4655.38 → 4655.70] answer.
[4656.70 → 4657.32] And we
[4657.32 → 4657.78] pray that
[4657.78 → 4658.28] we will
[4658.28 → 4658.98] answer them
[4658.98 → 4660.22] by faith
[4660.22 → 4661.46] and the
[4661.46 → 4661.94] power of
[4661.94 → 4662.38] the Spirit
[4662.38 → 4662.76] with a
[4662.76 → 4663.28] strong
[4663.28 → 4664.04] yes.
[4665.00 → 4665.98] Because we
[4665.98 → 4666.50] have been
[4666.50 → 4666.90] changed
[4666.90 → 4667.50] inwardly.
[4667.50 → 4668.66] Lord,
[4668.74 → 4669.22] bless us
[4669.22 → 4669.68] with new
[4669.68 → 4670.02] hearts
[4670.02 → 4671.20] again and
[4671.20 → 4671.54] again.
[4672.50 → 4673.12] Help us
[4673.12 → 4673.62] to trust
[4673.62 → 4673.96] in you
[4673.96 → 4674.62] afresh
[4674.62 → 4675.26] every day
[4675.26 → 4676.26] so that
[4676.26 → 4676.60] we might
[4676.60 → 4676.92] live.
[4677.52 → 4677.94] We pray
[4677.94 → 4678.34] this in
[4678.34 → 4678.56] Jesus'
[4678.76 → 4679.40] name and
[4679.40 → 4679.76] for his
[4679.76 → 4680.04] sake.
[4680.26 → 4680.46] Amen.
[4683.30 → 4683.74] Okay,
[4683.88 → 4684.48] let's stand
[4684.48 → 4684.86] and we'll
[4684.86 → 4686.34] sing a song
[4686.34 → 4687.00] of response
[4687.00 → 4687.84] of whom
[4687.84 → 4688.36] God is
[4688.36 → 4688.70] and what
[4688.70 → 4689.12] he does
[4689.12 → 4689.40] in our
[4689.40 → 4689.86] lives.
[4689.86 → 4689.96] Amen.
[4689.96 → 4690.02] Amen.
[4690.02 → 4690.06] Amen.
[4690.06 → 4690.08] Amen.

[4690.16 → 4690.56] Amen.
[4690.56 → 4690.66] Amen.
[4690.66 → 4690.68] Amen.
[4690.68 → 4690.72] Amen.
[4690.72 → 4690.96] Amen.
[4690.96 → 4692.06] Amen.
[4692.06 → 4692.12] Amen.
[4692.12 → 4692.60] Amen.
[4692.60 → 4692.62] Amen.
[4692.62 → 4692.68] Amen.
[4692.68 → 4692.72] Amen.
[4692.72 → 4693.12] Amen.
[4693.12 → 4693.96] Amen.
[4693.96 → 4694.00] Amen.
[4694.00 → 4694.56] Amen.
[4694.56 → 4694.62] Amen.
[4694.62 → 4695.62] Amen.
[4724.62 → 4727.76] Amen.
[4727.76 → 4729.76] Jesus' name.
[4730.56 → 4733.76] A walker's dissonant,
[4733.76 → 4735.76] a walker's kill,
[4735.76 → 4737.76] all other ground
[4737.76 → 4739.76] he's singing stand.
[4739.76 → 4741.76] All other ground
[4741.76 → 4745.76] he's singing stand.
[4745.76 → 4747.76] But if darkness
[4747.76 → 4749.76] fills his glowing face,
[4749.76 → 4751.76] I rest him
[4751.76 → 4755.76] is no changing praise.
[4755.76 → 4757.76] In every light
[4757.76 → 4759.76] and stormy day,
[4759.76 → 4761.76] my anchor
[4761.76 → 4763.76] rolled in the air.
[4765.76 → 4767.76] On Christ the snow
[4767.76 → 4769.76] and on the snow,

[4771.76 → 4773.76] he's singing stand.
[4773.76 → 4775.76] All other ground
[4775.76 → 4779.76] he's singing stand.
[4779.76 → 4781.76] He's only
[4781.76 → 4783.76] covered
[4783.76 → 4785.76] in the snow.
[4785.76 → 4787.76] He's
[4787.76 → 4789.76] covered
[4789.76 → 4791.76] in the snow.
[4791.76 → 4793.76] In all

[4795.76 → 4797.76] snow
[4797.76 → 4799.76] and on the snow.

[4811.76 → 4813.76] All other ground
[4813.76 → 4815.76] he's singing stand.
[4815.76 → 4817.76] When he shall come
[4817.76 → 4819.76] with the wind
[4819.76 → 4821.76] of his snow,
[4821.76 → 4823.76] all the other
[4823.76 → 4825.76] name of the ground.
[4825.76 → 4827.76] And the state
[4827.76 → 4829.76] is righteous,
[4829.76 → 4831.76] as the Lord.
[4831.76 → 4833.76] He's
[4833.76 → 4835.76] singing
[4835.76 → 4837.76] and on the snow.
[4837.76 → 4839.76] He's
[4839.76 → 4841.76] singing
[4841.76 → 4843.76] and on the snow.
[4843.76 → 4845.76] All other ground
[4845.76 → 4847.76] he's singing stand.
[4847.76 → 4849.76] He's singing
[4849.76 → 4851.76] and on the snow.
[4851.76 → 4853.76] Give me a seat.
[4853.76 → 4855.76] Give me a seat.
[4855.76 → 4857.76] Give me a seat.
[4857.76 → 4859.76] Give me a seat.
[4859.76 → 4861.76] Give me a seat.
[4861.76 → 4863.76] Give me a seat.
[4863.76 → 4865.76] Give me a seat.
[4865.76 → 4867.76] Give me a seat.
[4867.76 → 4869.76] So, in response to love's God
[4869.76 → 4871.76] and mercy that we can stand before the throne
[4871.76 → 4873.76] in Christ alone.
[4873.76 → 4875.76] We have an opportunity now to respond
[4875.76 → 4877.76] by his grace,
[4877.76 → 4879.76] not a compulsion,
[4879.76 → 4881.76] but to respond by giving of our tithes and our offerings.
[4881.76 → 4883.76] Our designated offering this morning
[4883.76 → 4885.76] is for our South Delta Meals on Wheels.
[4885.76 → 4888.76] It's a program under Delta Assist
[4888.76 → 4890.76] that provides home delivered meals
[4890.76 → 4892.76] to support the nutritional needs
[4892.76 → 4894.76] of seniors, the disabled
[4894.76 → 4896.76] and those recovering from surgery
[4896.76 → 4899.76] or illness in the Delta community.
[4899.76 → 4901.76] So the deacons will come up now
[4901.76 → 4905.76] and pass the offering bag.
[4931.76 → 4950.76] Which helps us Burn our W Shows
[4950.76 → 4952.76] see gifts not Seymour
[4952.76 → 4953.76] Amen.
[4982.76 → 4984.76] Amen.
[5012.76 → 5014.76] Amen.
[5042.76 → 5044.76] Amen.
[5072.76 → 5074.76] Amen.
[5102.76 → 5104.76] Amen.
[5104.76 → 5114.76] So it is with sadness of heart that some of you know, some of you don't, that Ernst de Vries
[5114.76 → 5118.76] passed into glory this morning at 530.
[5132.76 → 5146.76] I don't know if I'm going to be able to speak.
[5146.76 → 5151.36] All right, but I'll try.
[5151.36 → 5153.16] So let's pray.
[5153.16 → 5166.16] Let's pray for Winnie and Peter, Miriam, Matthias, Hendrick, and Roger.
[5166.16 → 5173.76] And let's ask for God's mercy.
[5173.76 → 5182.16] Lord Christ, we thank you that in your risen glory, you are here.
[5182.16 → 5188.16] That you are present with us, that you are near to us.
[5188.16 → 5191.16] And Lord, you are not aloof.
[5191.16 → 5192.16] You are not distant.
[5192.16 → 5195.16] You are not unaware or unconcerned.
[5195.16 → 5203.16] But you, Lord, are present, and you are close to your brothers and sisters.
[5203.16 → 5214.16] Lord, we pray for Ernst and Winnie's children.
[5214.16 → 5220.16] And Lord, we praise you for bringing Ernst home to glory.
[5220.16 → 5231.16] We thank you for his life, his faith, his kindness, his big heartedness.
[5231.16 → 5247.16] And we pray, Lord, for the peace of Christ to be over Ernst's family in this time of mourning.
[5247.16 → 5253.16] And as earth is brought, Lord, by you from one degree of glory to another, may the spirit
[5253.16 → 5260.16] of the living God comfort Winnie and the family and all of us who yet still walk in the valley
[5260.16 → 5263.16] of the shadow of death.
[5263.16 → 5267.16] May the hope of the glorious resurrection sustain us.
[5267.16 → 5274.16] Lord, would you come for us by the victory of Christ over death, by the hope that we have
[5274.16 → 5280.16] of glory, by the presence of your spirit with us.
[5280.16 → 5284.16] Come quickly, O Lord, to help us.
[5284.16 → 5288.16] Let each one of us find you mighty to save this day.
[5288.16 → 5294.16] Through Jesus Christ, your son, our Lord, we pray now and forever.
[5294.16 → 5295.16] Amen.
[5295.16 → 5298.16] All right.
[5298.16 → 5311.16] Let's stand, and we will go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5311.16 → 5314.16] Again, join us for coffee.
[5314.16 → 5317.16] Yeah, coffee and also buns and soup.
[5317.16 → 5320.16] And we'll have a time of fellowship together at two o'clock.
[5320.16 → 5322.16] Again, there is the Mountain View singing.
[5322.16 → 5326.16] But now I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5326.16 → 5332.16] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the
[5332.16 → 5338.16] present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depths nor anything else in all
[5338.16 → 5346.16] of creation will be able to separate you from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus,
[5346.16 → 5347.16] our Lord.
[5347.16 → 5348.16] Amen.
[5352.16 → 5353.16] So, if you take the thank us, I have ever come here to know this song.
[5353.16 → 5354.16] So, that is God and God may come here.
[5354.16 → 5355.16] So, that is God, his son is.
[5355.16 → 5356.16] My Son, your son, our daughter and our boy.
[5356.16 → 5357.16] Thanks, his son, Choral is God.
[5357.16 → 5358.16] By our faith.
[5358.16 → 5359.16] Your son.
[5359.16 → 5361.16] My son, your son is the heavier, this is a beautiful name that we can sing
[5361.16 → 5362.16] is O how we will not understand.
[5362.16 → 5363.16] You are.
[5363.16 → 5364.16] Well, your son, your father's blessing to, you are, we not?
[5364.16 → 5367.42] By the grace we've been saved,
[5367.42 → 5370.42] from our man to the Lord.
[5370.42 → 5372.80] Join by faith,
[5372.80 → 5374.42] God and heart,
[5374.42 → 5377.92] for your glory, Lord.
[5377.92 → 5381.42] Grant us peace and unity,
[5381.42 → 5384.92] through us now we pray.
[5384.92 → 5386.92] Hand in hand,
[5386.92 → 5388.92] with souls to free,
[5388.92 → 5392.36] find us, Lord, and use us, Lord,
[5392.36 → 5398.62] only as Lord today.
[5398.62 → 5402.62] By your grace we've been saved,
[5402.62 → 5406.12] from our man to love.
[5406.12 → 5408.10] Join by faith,
[5408.10 → 5409.86] Lord and heart,
[5409.86 → 5413.52] for your glory, Lord.
[5413.52 → 5417.22] Grant us peace and unity,
[5417.22 → 5421.00] through us now we pray.
[5421.00 → 5422.64] And in hand,
[5422.64 → 5424.76] with souls to free,
[5424.76 → 5426.66] find us more than,
[5426.66 → 5428.64] use us hope for,
[5428.64 → 5433.26] we must hope to be.

[5441.40 → 5444.96] Amen.
[5444.96 → 5474.94] Thank you.
[5474.96 → 5504.94] Thank you.
