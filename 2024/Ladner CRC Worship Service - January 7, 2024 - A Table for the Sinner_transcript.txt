[353.54 --> 354.54]  Amen.
[354.54 --> 355.54]  Well, good morning to you all.
[355.54 --> 356.54]  Good morning.
[356.54 --> 361.54]  It's good to see you all here, and those of you who are coming in under Zoom, good morning
[361.54 --> 363.54]  to you as well.
[363.54 --> 366.54]  This is Leidner Christian Reformed Church, and I'm John Smith, and I will be helping out
[366.54 --> 369.54]  with some of the early aspects of the service this morning.
[369.54 --> 372.54]  It's good to see you all here.
[372.54 --> 377.94]  Later on, Pastor Jason True will begin a new sermon series that starts today, Come to the
[377.94 --> 381.34]  Table, a table for sinners.
[381.34 --> 392.74]  But before we begin all that, our clerk, John Banstra, has a couple of words to say.
[392.74 --> 398.04]  It's been a tradition in our church that the clerk comes out with a year-end review, which
[398.04 --> 399.04]  I did.
[399.04 --> 403.44]  I'm going to be a little bit of a book that I've written up, and that John Vandermeer actually
[403.44 --> 404.44]  read here on Christmas Day.
[404.44 --> 405.44]  I mean, sorry, on New Year's Day.
[405.44 --> 410.84]  I don't know how many of you are all here, but I have printed out copies of the report,
[410.84 --> 415.44]  and they're on the foyer table for those of you that want to pick them up.
[415.44 --> 421.84]  But I must say that it's a corrected report, because when John read the report, I had omitted
[421.84 --> 422.84]  a name.
[422.84 --> 429.74]  I had listed the deaths in our congregation the past year, and I had omitted Peter Krusinga.
[429.74 --> 435.04]  And I just feel terrible about this, and I've talked to Pat, apologized to her.
[435.04 --> 439.44]  So I just wanted to make you all aware of that, just an oversight.
[439.44 --> 442.44]  So, and pick up a copy if you want to read the report.
[442.44 --> 443.44]  Thank you.
[443.44 --> 453.44]  John's taller than I am.
[453.44 --> 457.74]  If you're a visitor here, you might not know that after the service, we meet for coffee
[457.74 --> 462.34]  and socialization afterward, and we encourage you to do that as well.
[462.34 --> 465.54]  We'd like to meet you.
[465.54 --> 468.74]  Today's offering is for Therefore Go Ministries.
[468.74 --> 473.14]  It's a ministry that helps churches challenge youth and emerging adults to commit their lives
[473.14 --> 478.32]  to Jesus Christ and transform this world for him by assisting churches with their ministry
[478.32 --> 482.54]  to youth through training, coaching, and peer learning.
[482.54 --> 486.84]  That offering will be taken later on in the service.
[486.84 --> 490.84]  Today is the day of Epiphany.
[490.84 --> 496.94]  Some Christian denominations actually think of this as January 6th, always every year,
[496.94 --> 498.94]  the 12 days after Christmas.
[498.94 --> 504.04]  Others have decided that it's the first Sunday of the new year, give or take 12 hours.
[504.04 --> 506.44]  It's the day of Epiphany.
[506.44 --> 511.00]  And Jason will go through this as part of his sermon series and discuss it more thoroughly
[511.00 --> 512.30]  later on.
[512.30 --> 517.30]  But Epiphany is a reference to the fact that the Magi showed up at some time after Jesus'
[517.30 --> 523.60]  birth and recognized that he was not just a baby, that he was divine.
[523.60 --> 531.24]  And that because they were not Jewish or Israeli, that it was a recognition that he was divine
[531.24 --> 532.54]  for all people.
[532.54 --> 537.54]  And that's the basic underpinnings of the concept of the day of Epiphany.
[537.54 --> 540.84]  Epiphany is a witness.
[540.84 --> 546.84]  Our call to worship this morning is a litany based on Psalm 27 and a couple of verses out
[546.84 --> 550.84]  of John 4.
[550.84 --> 554.84]  Read with me when you see the double dash.
[554.84 --> 567.14]  Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[567.14 --> 586.44]  Teach us your ways and make straight our paths in this hour of worship and always.
[586.44 --> 594.74]  To begin, let me lead you in an opening prayer of adoration while we ask for God's presence
[594.74 --> 596.74]  with us during this morning's service.
[596.74 --> 604.54]  eternal God, we come before you with words of praise.
[604.54 --> 610.34]  We seek to worship you and draw closer to you for you are worthy of praise.
[610.34 --> 614.24]  You created the heavens and the earth and all that is contained within.
[614.24 --> 618.08]  We thank you for your mighty acts in creation.
[618.08 --> 623.34]  We give you thanks for your son, Jesus Christ, for his ministry of teaching and healing, for
[623.34 --> 628.14]  providing us with a way to you and for the promise of eternal life.
[628.14 --> 633.72]  O God, in your great mercy, you provide us with all that we need.
[633.72 --> 637.92]  We take joy in the abundance of your bounty.
[637.92 --> 643.60]  We pray that we will always follow your ways and that your presence will shelter us.
[643.60 --> 650.18]  For you are our rock and our redeemer, our hiding place and strong tower.
[650.18 --> 651.76]  Thank you for loving us.
[651.76 --> 655.26]  Join with us as we honor you this morning.
[655.26 --> 658.76]  Amen.
[658.76 --> 664.94]  The Lord's greeting comes to us from Isaiah.
[664.94 --> 670.52]  This is what the Lord, the God, the Lord says, the creator of the heavens, who stretches
[670.52 --> 674.48]  them out and who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it.
[674.48 --> 676.16]  I am the Lord.
[676.16 --> 679.66]  I have called you in righteousness.
[679.66 --> 680.66]  Read with me.
[680.66 --> 683.54]  Ficken you by the hand and kept you.
[683.54 --> 691.10]  I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations to open the eyes that
[691.10 --> 692.60]  are blind.
[692.60 --> 693.60]  I am the Lord.
[693.60 --> 694.60]  I am the Lord.
[694.60 --> 695.60]  That is my name.
[695.60 --> 699.60]  Please stand now and greet one another in preparation for singing a couple songs of praise.
[699.60 --> 701.60]  You are now?
[701.60 --> 702.60]  I am second over again.
[702.60 --> 704.60]  May I have taken before the earth coming to the crossbar.
[704.60 --> 705.08]  Rule in peace another?
[705.08 --> 706.78]  I am the Lord but we do that.
[706.78 --> 708.78]  Now let's open it up here here.
[708.78 --> 709.98]  Now a place has been cleaned up here.
[709.98 --> 710.66]  May I request you a letter?
[710.66 --> 711.58]  Well, let's begin.
[711.58 --> 712.62]  Okay.
[712.62 --> 713.04]  Wonderful.
[713.04 --> 722.28]  And so the effort that young people do greater any moreacaks Land habtans and how the
[722.28 --> 724.92]  listeners will reach a reminder to those who have trees from it.
[724.92 --> 726.60]  May I request.
[726.60 --> 756.58]  Thank you.
[756.60 --> 786.58]  Thank you.
[786.60 --> 791.56]  Another year of grace.
[792.44 --> 797.86]  This Jesus came to ensign's war.
[798.40 --> 803.48]  The name of names for us he bore.
[804.02 --> 809.18]  Rejoice, rejoice with thanks and praise.
[809.60 --> 814.92]  Another year of grace.
[814.92 --> 820.92]  This love abundant far exceeds.
[822.20 --> 827.34]  The volume of our whole years leads.
[827.84 --> 833.20]  Rejoice, rejoice with thanks and praise.
[833.76 --> 838.92]  Another year of grace.
[838.92 --> 845.82]  All glory be to God on high.
[846.20 --> 850.92]  And peace on earth, the angels cry.
[850.92 --> 856.92]  Rejoice, rejoice with thanks and praise.
[858.20 --> 862.92]  Another year of grace.
[862.92 --> 866.92]  O God.
[866.92 --> 869.92]  Rejoice, rejoice with thanks and praise.
[869.92 --> 876.92]  O God.
[877.20 --> 878.92]  O God.
[878.92 --> 879.92]  O God.
[879.92 --> 880.92]  O God.
[880.92 --> 882.92]  O God.
[882.92 --> 883.92]  O God.
[883.92 --> 889.92]  O God.
[889.92 --> 891.92]  O God.
[891.92 --> 892.92]  O God.
[892.92 --> 894.92]  Beyond all praise.
[894.92 --> 898.92]  We worship you today.
[898.92 --> 899.92]  And sing.
[899.92 --> 900.92]  O God.
[900.92 --> 901.92]  O God.
[901.92 --> 902.92]  O God.
[902.92 --> 903.92]  O God.
[903.92 --> 904.92]  O God.
[904.92 --> 905.92]  O God.
[905.92 --> 906.92]  O God.
[906.92 --> 907.92]  O God.
[907.92 --> 908.92]  O God.
[908.92 --> 909.92]  O God.
[909.92 --> 910.92]  O God.
[910.92 --> 911.92]  O God.
[911.92 --> 912.92]  O God.
[912.92 --> 918.92]  We can only wonder at every gift you send.
[918.92 --> 928.92]  And blessings without number and mercies without end.
[928.92 --> 937.92]  We lift our hearts before you and wait upon your word.
[937.92 --> 950.92]  We honor and adore your mighty Lord.
[950.92 --> 960.92]  The flower of earth is wintered in time assuredly dying.
[960.92 --> 970.92]  Its fragile bloom surrendered to evil art most high.
[970.92 --> 980.92]  But hidden from all nature, the eternal seed is sown.
[980.92 --> 990.92]  Though small immortal stature, to heaven's garden grow.
[990.92 --> 1000.92]  For Christ, your gift from heaven, God does set us free.
[1000.92 --> 1012.92]  And we through Him are given world's final victory.
[1012.92 --> 1022.92]  And hear, O gracious Savior, accept the love we bring.
[1022.92 --> 1032.92]  That we who know your kingdom may serve you as our King.
[1032.92 --> 1043.92]  Then whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill.
[1043.92 --> 1048.92]  We'll triumph through our sorrows.
[1048.92 --> 1052.92]  Then rise to bless you still.
[1052.92 --> 1063.92]  To marvel at your beauty and glory in your ways.
[1063.92 --> 1074.92]  And make a joyful duty, our sacrifice of grace.
[1078.92 --> 1092.92]  So over the last month or so, I haven't really kept track.
[1092.92 --> 1098.92]  I have been introducing an additional scripture reading into our worship service.
[1098.92 --> 1101.92]  I don't know if you've noticed that.
[1101.92 --> 1104.92]  And I actually have not gotten approval from the worship committee yet.
[1104.92 --> 1109.92]  But this is kind of one of those, you know, ask permission, don't ask permission, ask for forgiveness.
[1109.92 --> 1114.92]  The reason is, scripture reading is important.
[1114.92 --> 1117.92]  We should be, we want to be people of the word.
[1117.92 --> 1125.92]  And as we worship each Sunday, of course, it's only fitting that the public reading of scripture is a prominent part of our worship.
[1125.92 --> 1135.92]  And so the way I want to do it is, they will somewhat be tied to the scripture, the sermon passage.
[1135.92 --> 1144.92]  And especially if I will be, say, preaching from the New Testament for the sermon, we'll do an Old Testament scripture reading and vice versa.
[1144.92 --> 1148.92]  Okay, and so sometimes you'll see the connection, sometimes you won't.
[1148.92 --> 1150.92]  I'm not going to explain it.
[1150.92 --> 1152.92]  It might come out in the sermon later.
[1152.92 --> 1155.92]  But anyway, it's just, let's read God's word.
[1155.92 --> 1158.92]  So I do want to invite you to open up a Bible.
[1158.92 --> 1162.92]  And we will turn to Psalm 51 today.
[1162.92 --> 1167.92]  That is on page 424 of your pew Bible.
[1167.92 --> 1181.92]  Psalm 51, page 424.
[1181.92 --> 1187.92]  This is a reading from the psalmist, Psalm 51.
[1187.92 --> 1192.92]  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love.
[1192.92 --> 1197.92]  According to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
[1197.92 --> 1204.92]  Wash me, all my iniquity, wash away all my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
[1204.92 --> 1208.92]  For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me.
[1208.92 --> 1213.92]  Against you, you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
[1213.92 --> 1218.92]  So that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.
[1218.92 --> 1224.92]  Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
[1224.92 --> 1229.92]  Surely the desire, surely you desire truth in the inner parts.
[1229.92 --> 1233.92]  You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
[1233.92 --> 1236.92]  Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be clean.
[1236.92 --> 1239.92]  Wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
[1239.92 --> 1241.92]  Let me hear joy and gladness.
[1241.92 --> 1244.92]  Let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
[1244.92 --> 1248.92]  Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.
[1248.92 --> 1254.92]  Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[1254.92 --> 1259.92]  Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
[1259.92 --> 1266.92]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[1266.92 --> 1272.92]  Then I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners will turn back to you.
[1272.92 --> 1277.92]  Save me from blood guilt, O God, the God who saves me.
[1277.92 --> 1280.92]  And my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
[1280.92 --> 1284.92]  O Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise.
[1284.92 --> 1288.92]  You do not delight in sacrifice or I would bring it.
[1288.92 --> 1290.92]  You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
[1290.92 --> 1300.92]  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
[1300.92 --> 1305.92]  In your good pleasure make Zion prosper. Build up the walls of Jerusalem.
[1305.92 --> 1310.92]  Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you.
[1310.92 --> 1313.92]  Then bowls will be offered on your altar.
[1313.92 --> 1315.92]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1316.92 --> 1319.92]  You may remain seated for our next song.
[1320.92 --> 1324.92]  Our next song is a familiar one, Take My Life and Let It Be.
[1324.92 --> 1327.92]  And it is a wonderful song as we start another year.
[1327.92 --> 1335.92]  It is a prayer to God, affirming to him that all we have and all we are is for him and his glory.
[1335.92 --> 1341.92]  The song was written in 1874 by Francis Ridley Havergal, a gifted evangelist.
[1341.92 --> 1347.92]  Francis was able to memorize large portions of scripture which she would use in her evangelism work.
[1347.92 --> 1350.92]  Francis shared this story.
[1350.92 --> 1354.92]  I went for a five-day visit to a house where ten people lived.
[1354.92 --> 1359.92]  Some were unconverted and some were converted, but not as rejoicing Christians.
[1359.92 --> 1364.92]  God put on my heart the prayer, Lord, give me all in this house.
[1364.92 --> 1366.92]  And he did.
[1366.92 --> 1371.92]  I was so happy and spent the last night rejoicing and giving praise to God.
[1371.92 --> 1377.92]  The verses of this song formed themselves and chimed in my heart until they finished with,
[1377.92 --> 1380.92]  Ever, only, all for thee.
[1380.92 --> 1384.92]  Let's stand and sing this song together as a prayer to our Heavenly Father.
[1384.92 --> 1385.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1385.92 --> 1386.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1386.92 --> 1387.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1387.92 --> 1388.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1388.92 --> 1389.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1389.92 --> 1390.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1390.92 --> 1392.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1392.92 --> 1397.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1397.92 --> 1404.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1404.92 --> 1409.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1409.92 --> 1410.92]  Take my life and let it be.
[1410.92 --> 1411.92]  Ones are great, Lord, to thee.
[1411.92 --> 1416.92]  Take my moments and my days.
[1416.92 --> 1426.92]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[1426.92 --> 1433.92]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[1433.92 --> 1443.92]  Take my hands and let them move.
[1443.92 --> 1450.92]  At the impulse of thy love.
[1450.92 --> 1456.92]  Take my feet and let them be.
[1456.92 --> 1459.92]  Swift and beautiful for thee.
[1459.92 --> 1464.92]  Swift and beautiful for thee.
[1464.92 --> 1471.92]  Swift and beautiful for thee.
[1471.92 --> 1477.92]  Take my voice and let me sing.
[1477.92 --> 1487.92]  Always, only for my King.
[1487.92 --> 1492.92]  Take my lips and let them be.
[1492.92 --> 1495.92]  Fill with messages from thee.
[1495.92 --> 1500.92]  Fill with messages from thee.
[1500.92 --> 1507.92]  Fill with messages from thee.
[1507.92 --> 1535.92]  Fill with messages from me.
[1535.92 --> 1548.10]  My love, my Lord, I mourn, at thy feet its treasure store.
[1548.10 --> 1563.26]  Take myself and I will be ever only all for thee.
[1563.26 --> 1570.88]  Ever only all for thee.
[1593.26 --> 1596.34]  Kicking it old school.
[1596.34 --> 1605.20]  That's a phrase that some people use today, sometimes even me, to make a reference to
[1605.20 --> 1610.14]  do things the way we used to do them.
[1610.14 --> 1617.26]  You know, for decades in my life that meant hearing the law, Ten Commandments in the morning,
[1617.26 --> 1621.86]  then coming back in the evening and somewhere in that evening service listening to the Apostles'
[1621.86 --> 1624.44]  Creed.
[1624.44 --> 1629.86]  We actually don't do that often anymore, but as a youth I would say that was a good idea
[1629.86 --> 1636.88]  because I was thinking as a mid-teenager that this is done so often that it no longer has
[1636.88 --> 1639.54]  any impact on me anymore.
[1639.54 --> 1643.58]  I'm not sure I agree with that as an older person, but that's certainly the way I thought
[1643.58 --> 1644.58]  then.
[1644.58 --> 1651.30]  But we have seen as a Christian organization not to be doing that either much anymore these
[1651.30 --> 1652.30]  days.
[1652.30 --> 1659.34]  And so I thought I'd reinvigorate at least one aspect of it this morning.
[1659.34 --> 1663.10]  But before that, I learned some things from Jason.
[1663.10 --> 1669.58]  I did not ask for permission, but I'm going to read another scripture reference this morning.
[1669.58 --> 1673.38]  Perhaps I'll need forgiveness afterward.
[1673.38 --> 1677.62]  It's from Nehemiah chapter 7 of all places.
[1677.62 --> 1683.68]  Now I've abridged quite a few of the portions and taken selected verses of chapter 7 because
[1683.68 --> 1687.08]  it's actually quite of an interesting read and I encourage you to go home after the service
[1687.08 --> 1692.20]  and read chapter 7 of Nehemiah, but this is a record of the early days in Jerusalem after
[1692.20 --> 1697.06]  the return of the Israelites from captivity in Babylon.
[1697.06 --> 1701.48]  So reading my version of chapter 7.
[1701.48 --> 1706.88]  After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians,
[1706.88 --> 1709.92]  and the Levites were appointed.
[1709.92 --> 1714.76]  When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled into their towns, all the people
[1714.76 --> 1718.38]  came together as one in the square before the water gate.
[1718.38 --> 1723.38]  They told Ezra, the teacher of the law, to bring out the book of the law of Moses, which
[1723.38 --> 1726.48]  the Lord had commanded for Israel.
[1726.48 --> 1729.64]  He read it aloud from daybreak till noon.
[1729.64 --> 1732.32]  And all the people listened attentively.
[1732.32 --> 1737.52]  The Levites instructed the people in the law while they were standing there, making it clear,
[1737.52 --> 1741.76]  and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read.
[1741.76 --> 1747.38]  Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest, and the Levites who were instructing the people
[1747.38 --> 1752.38]  said to them all, This day is holy to the Lord your God.
[1752.38 --> 1754.38]  Do not mourn or weep.
[1754.38 --> 1759.38]  For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the law.
[1759.38 --> 1766.00]  Now, I don't want to draw too many analogies to a population that has been in captivity
[1766.00 --> 1769.00]  for 70 years in a town called Babylon to us.
[1769.00 --> 1776.00]  But in this first day, this day of epiphany of the year, and in anticipation of the Lord's
[1776.00 --> 1782.00]  Supper communion next week, why don't we read the Nicene Creed this morning, which will
[1782.00 --> 1784.38]  be on the screen?
[1784.38 --> 1786.80]  Read with me.
[1786.80 --> 1795.62]  We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible
[1795.62 --> 1797.90]  and invisible.
[1797.90 --> 1805.38]  And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten from the Father before all
[1805.38 --> 1806.38]  ages.
[1806.38 --> 1816.98]  For God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same essence
[1816.98 --> 1818.80]  as the Father.
[1818.80 --> 1822.26]  Through him all things were made.
[1822.26 --> 1827.42]  For us and for our salvation, he came down from heaven.
[1827.42 --> 1835.80]  He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made human.
[1835.80 --> 1840.22]  He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.
[1840.22 --> 1842.74]  He suffered and was buried.
[1842.74 --> 1847.56]  The third day he rose again according to the scriptures.
[1847.56 --> 1859.80]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[1859.80 --> 1864.46]  Following that, our song of response will be, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy.
[1864.46 --> 1871.46]  When that song is completed, the children ages three to grade five are welcome to go to kids'
[1871.46 --> 1873.46]  life.
[1894.46 --> 1901.46]  There's a Wideness in God's Mercy.
[1901.46 --> 1905.46]  Like the Wideness of the Sea.
[1905.46 --> 1915.46]  There's a Kindness in God's Justice, which is more than Liberty.
[1915.46 --> 1925.46]  There is no place where our sorrows are more felt than open head.
[1925.46 --> 1936.46]  There is no place where our feelings have such kindly judgment give.
[1936.46 --> 1943.46]  There is no place where our feelings have such kindly given.
[1943.46 --> 1953.46]  For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind.
[1953.46 --> 1963.46]  And the heart of the eternal is thus wonderfully kind.
[1963.46 --> 1968.46]  Make our love of God more faithful.
[1968.46 --> 1973.46]  Let us take you at your word.
[1973.46 --> 1985.46]  And our lives will be thanksgiving for the goodness of the Lord.
[1993.46 --> 2017.46]  Thank you.
[2017.46 --> 2018.46]  Okay.
[2018.46 --> 2019.46]  Welcome back to you all again.
[2019.46 --> 2021.46]  It's good to be here with you.
[2021.46 --> 2028.46]  Today, as John has already introduced, is the first Sunday in the church season of Epiphany.
[2028.46 --> 2035.46]  Now, I know not everyone is familiar with the church calendar, but here's what you need to know.
[2035.46 --> 2044.46]  Epiphany is the season when the church around the world throughout history gives sustained attention
[2044.46 --> 2049.46]  the questions of Jesus' identity and his mission.
[2049.46 --> 2056.46]  And so it's very normal during this time of year to read the stories from the gospel accounts in the Bible
[2056.46 --> 2061.46]  that reveal to us who Jesus is and what he came to do.
[2061.46 --> 2069.46]  And the way we're going to be doing that this year is through a sermon series called Come to the Table.
[2069.46 --> 2081.46]  In this series, we're going to be looking at Jesus' ministry and the interactions that he has with different people in the gospels over a meal.
[2081.46 --> 2087.46]  Now, Luke's gospel is full of stories of Jesus eating with people.
[2087.46 --> 2090.46]  There's one commentator who said this,
[2090.46 --> 2097.46]  Jesus is either going to a meal or at a meal or coming from a meal.
[2097.46 --> 2103.46]  And so the table is a central imagery in Luke's gospel.
[2103.46 --> 2111.46]  And as we read Luke's gospel, we discover that for Jesus, meals, inviting people to a meal,
[2111.46 --> 2117.46]  is a sign of God's grace and God's welcome into the kingdom.
[2117.46 --> 2120.46]  So that's what our sermon series is going to be about,
[2120.46 --> 2126.46]  looking at these different episodes in the gospel of Luke where Jesus, at a meal, eats with these different people.
[2126.46 --> 2135.46]  And so the first one we're going to look at today is called, I'm calling a table for sinners, a table for the sinner.
[2135.46 --> 2139.46]  And so let's open our passage for today, Luke chapter seven.
[2139.46 --> 2145.46]  So this is on page 767 in your pew Bible.
[2145.46 --> 2146.46]  Page 767.
[2146.46 --> 2158.46]  And we're reading Luke chapter seven, verses 34 to 50.
[2158.46 --> 2164.46]  Luke 7, 34 to 50.
[2164.46 --> 2169.46]  Here now the reading of God's word.
[2169.46 --> 2171.46]  The son of man came eating and drinking.
[2171.46 --> 2178.46]  And you say, here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.
[2178.46 --> 2181.46]  But wisdom is proved by all of her children.
[2181.46 --> 2186.46]  Now, one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him.
[2186.46 --> 2189.46]  So he went to the Pharisees house and reclined at the table.
[2189.46 --> 2195.46]  When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house,
[2195.46 --> 2198.46]  she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.
[2198.46 --> 2205.46]  And as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears.
[2205.46 --> 2211.46]  Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.
[2211.46 --> 2217.46]  When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, if this man were a prophet,
[2217.46 --> 2224.46]  he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner.
[2224.46 --> 2229.46]  Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to tell you.
[2229.46 --> 2232.46]  Tell me, teacher, he said.
[2232.46 --> 2235.46]  Two men owed money to a certain money lender.
[2235.46 --> 2239.46]  One owed him 500 denarii and the other 50.
[2239.46 --> 2242.46]  Neither of them had the money to pay him back.
[2242.46 --> 2244.46]  So he canceled the debts of both.
[2244.46 --> 2247.46]  Now, which of them will love him more?
[2247.46 --> 2251.46]  Simon replied, I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.
[2251.46 --> 2254.46]  You have judged correctly, Jesus said.
[2254.46 --> 2259.46]  Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, do you see this woman?
[2259.46 --> 2261.46]  I came into your house.
[2261.46 --> 2268.46]  You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
[2268.46 --> 2270.46]  You did not give me a kiss.
[2270.46 --> 2275.46]  But this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.
[2275.46 --> 2281.46]  You did not put oil on my head, but she has perfume or poured perfume on my feet.
[2281.46 --> 2288.46]  Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven for she loved much.
[2288.46 --> 2292.46]  But he who has been forgiven little loves little.
[2292.46 --> 2297.46]  Then Jesus said to her, your sins are forgiven.
[2297.46 --> 2305.46]  And the other guests began to say among themselves, who is this for who even forgives sins?
[2305.46 --> 2308.46]  Jesus said to the woman, your faith has saved you.
[2308.46 --> 2310.46]  Go in peace.
[2310.46 --> 2315.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2315.46 --> 2319.46]  Let's pray.
[2319.46 --> 2328.46]  Heavenly Father, some of us hear that word sinner and we think that's me.
[2328.46 --> 2333.46]  Others of us hear that word and we think that's somebody else.
[2333.46 --> 2339.46]  Lord, I pray all of us this morning would see you as you really are in this story.
[2339.46 --> 2345.46]  Lord, help us to see your heart to forgive and to welcome us into your kingdom.
[2345.46 --> 2350.46]  And it's in Christ's name that we pray and for his glory and the good of his people.
[2350.46 --> 2351.46]  Amen.
[2351.46 --> 2362.46]  So back in 2016, Larry King sat down with the actor Anthony Hopkins for an interview.
[2362.46 --> 2369.46]  Larry King asked Anthony Hopkins if at the age of 79, if he had any regrets.
[2369.46 --> 2372.46]  No, he answered.
[2372.46 --> 2377.46]  He said, quote, I don't have time to regret.
[2377.46 --> 2385.46]  We move on because we are acceptable for what we are, not what we think we should be.
[2385.46 --> 2386.46]  I'm a sinner.
[2386.46 --> 2387.46]  I'm an old sinner.
[2387.46 --> 2389.46]  I've done some bad things.
[2389.46 --> 2391.46]  I've done some good things.
[2391.46 --> 2396.46]  So, you know, you just forgive yourself and move on.
[2396.46 --> 2407.44]  Now, you can kind of imagine in our cultural moment if you, this Oscar moment, right, where there's a soundtrack playing as he's saying this into the
[2407.44 --> 2414.44]  camera, and this really is a stunning view of the default religion of many people today.
[2414.44 --> 2420.44]  It's kind of this Christless Christianity where he admits that he has sin.
[2420.44 --> 2423.44]  He admits that he needs acceptance.
[2423.44 --> 2426.44]  He admits that he needs forgiveness.
[2426.44 --> 2430.44]  But he finds all of those things in himself.
[2430.44 --> 2432.44]  He forgives himself.
[2432.44 --> 2435.44]  He accepts himself the way he is.
[2435.44 --> 2439.44]  He says you just have to forgive yourself and move on.
[2439.44 --> 2444.44]  But friends, self-forgiveness is profoundly difficult.
[2444.44 --> 2448.44]  Like, what if you can't forgive yourself?
[2448.44 --> 2450.44]  What do you do?
[2450.44 --> 2455.44]  You know, we've all got this judge inside of us.
[2455.44 --> 2459.44]  And maybe you've done something or you've said something.
[2459.44 --> 2462.44]  You've thought something or you've hidden something from others.
[2462.44 --> 2465.44]  And then we feel the shame of it.
[2465.44 --> 2466.44]  We feel the guilt of it.
[2466.44 --> 2468.44]  We feel condemnation.
[2468.44 --> 2473.44]  And all of us have had this feeling at some point in our lives.
[2473.44 --> 2481.44]  And the way we often try to forgive ourselves is actually just by silencing that internal judge that we have.
[2481.44 --> 2484.44]  And we do it in different ways.
[2484.44 --> 2489.44]  We might try to rationalize where we say, well, it's not that bad.
[2489.44 --> 2491.44]  Or we deflect.
[2491.44 --> 2496.44]  Maybe I don't have self-control, but really I'm actually a pretty nice person.
[2496.44 --> 2500.44]  We get defensive.
[2500.44 --> 2507.44]  We say, like, if people could just understand my intentions or if they could just understand what I am going through.
[2507.44 --> 2517.44]  Or sometimes we do this, you know, moral mathematics and hope that in the end the good things will outweigh the bad.
[2517.44 --> 2523.44]  But none of these strategies actually move us to a place of forgiveness.
[2523.44 --> 2528.44]  They just try to manage our shame by minimizing our sin.
[2528.44 --> 2532.44]  And in the end, it never really goes away.
[2532.44 --> 2535.44]  We might be able to silence it for a while.
[2535.44 --> 2537.44]  But it will reemerge.
[2537.44 --> 2545.44]  And so if self-forgiveness doesn't actually really work, how do we deal with our brokenness and our sin?
[2545.44 --> 2551.44]  Like, where can we find true, lasting forgiveness?
[2551.44 --> 2553.44]  And then how would we know?
[2553.44 --> 2556.44]  Like, how would we know if we really got it?
[2556.44 --> 2558.44]  What would that look like in our lives?
[2558.44 --> 2562.44]  And these are the kinds of things that we see in our passage this morning.
[2562.44 --> 2564.44]  And we're going to look at this in three ways this morning.
[2564.44 --> 2571.44]  We're going to look at facing judgment, then the forgiving judge, and then the fruit of forgiveness.
[2571.44 --> 2572.44]  Okay, so first, let's look at these.
[2572.44 --> 2575.44]  The first one, facing judgment.
[2575.44 --> 2579.44]  So let's think about our passage this morning, what's going on.
[2579.44 --> 2585.44]  Jesus is invited to a dinner party at the house of a Pharisee.
[2585.44 --> 2591.44]  The Pharisees, if you don't know, they were the cultural and religious elite of the day.
[2591.44 --> 2593.44]  They were the teachers of God's word.
[2593.44 --> 2596.44]  They were the holy men of Israel.
[2596.44 --> 2603.44]  And so far in Luke's Gospel, the Pharisees have been very critical and suspicious of Jesus.
[2603.44 --> 2611.44]  But Simon, in our passage, Simon the Pharisee, he invites Jesus to dinner.
[2611.44 --> 2616.44]  Which, in the ancient Near East, is an invitation to friendship.
[2616.44 --> 2619.44]  So that is remarkable.
[2619.44 --> 2620.44]  Right?
[2620.44 --> 2623.44]  Simon is actually interested in Jesus.
[2623.44 --> 2629.44]  The only other Pharisee in all the Gospels that show this kind of positive interest in Jesus is Nicodemus.
[2629.44 --> 2630.44]  Right?
[2630.44 --> 2632.44]  And he comes at night.
[2632.44 --> 2635.44]  Simon is inviting Jesus to his house for dinner.
[2635.44 --> 2640.44]  Now, so Simon, he publicly invites Jesus to his house.
[2640.44 --> 2643.44]  And that's the context in which this whole story is taking place.
[2643.44 --> 2644.44]  We're at a dinner party.
[2644.44 --> 2651.44]  But dinner parties in the first century are a little bit different from what we might do here today.
[2651.44 --> 2655.44]  So this is kind of what we need to imagine.
[2655.44 --> 2659.44]  Now, Jesus was called Rabbi, teacher.
[2659.44 --> 2667.44]  And the invitation of a rabbi or a teacher to dinner at your house is not a private thing.
[2667.44 --> 2670.44]  It's not like we'd have Thanksgiving and we just, it's kind of an intimate affair.
[2670.44 --> 2674.44]  This would actually be a semi-public event.
[2674.44 --> 2681.44]  So imagine a table set up in the house's outdoor courtyard.
[2681.44 --> 2683.44]  The doors are all open to the streets.
[2683.44 --> 2685.44]  The windows are open.
[2685.44 --> 2692.44]  And people of all kinds would actually come and they would just quietly kind of hang out around the outsides
[2692.44 --> 2698.44]  to listen in to this conversation that is happening at the dinner party.
[2698.44 --> 2701.44]  That would be welcome and expected.
[2701.44 --> 2710.44]  And at such a dinner, the guests would recline at table, which is my favorite way to eat as well.
[2710.44 --> 2717.44]  So they'd prop themselves up on one elbow and then the other would be free to eat and feed themselves.
[2717.44 --> 2722.44]  And then their legs and their feet would be kind of furthest away from the table, stretched out,
[2722.44 --> 2726.44]  kind of like spokes on a wheel.
[2726.44 --> 2731.44]  But at this dinner party, some drama begins to happen.
[2731.44 --> 2734.44]  And so look at verse 37.
[2734.44 --> 2741.44]  It says a woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house.
[2741.44 --> 2744.44]  So she came there.
[2744.44 --> 2748.44]  Now, this woman comes to the dinner party.
[2748.44 --> 2749.44]  That's not so unusual, right?
[2749.44 --> 2751.44]  People would kind of come.
[2751.44 --> 2752.44]  But notice who she is.
[2752.44 --> 2756.44]  Luke says she lived a sinful life.
[2756.44 --> 2761.44]  That is a gentle way of saying that she is a sex worker.
[2761.44 --> 2762.44]  Right?
[2762.44 --> 2764.44]  She and she is known for that.
[2764.44 --> 2766.44]  She has a reputation.
[2766.44 --> 2776.44]  So the presence of such a woman at this gathering of Pharisees, these holy men of Israel, is shocking.
[2776.44 --> 2778.44]  She doesn't belong there.
[2778.44 --> 2788.44]  If you are a sex worker in a hyper conservative male dominated society, where do you not go?
[2788.44 --> 2791.44]  The house of the Pharisee, right?
[2791.44 --> 2792.44]  But she goes.
[2792.44 --> 2797.44]  And actually, that would have taken a lot of courage.
[2797.44 --> 2800.44]  So this woman walks in.
[2800.44 --> 2803.44]  She is not a socially accepted person.
[2803.44 --> 2810.44]  But then, it's her actions that cause even a further disturbance.
[2810.44 --> 2814.44]  Because she goes into the dinner party, right?
[2814.44 --> 2817.44]  She doesn't just kind of come and like want to listen to the rabbi.
[2817.44 --> 2818.44]  She goes into the dinner party.
[2818.44 --> 2821.44]  She stands right behind Jesus' feet.
[2821.44 --> 2822.44]  And what does she do?
[2822.44 --> 2824.44]  She starts crying.
[2824.44 --> 2829.44]  Now, if you think to yourself, okay, well, you know, this is the first century.
[2829.44 --> 2830.44]  It was a long time ago.
[2830.44 --> 2833.44]  Maybe this kind of thing happened all the time.
[2833.44 --> 2834.44]  No.
[2834.44 --> 2835.44]  Okay.
[2835.44 --> 2841.44]  This is just as weird in that day as it would be for us.
[2841.44 --> 2842.44]  Right?
[2842.44 --> 2855.44]  If you throw a party in your house and someone comes in and they burst into tears right in the middle of the party, that is really kind of uncomfortable no matter what culture you are in.
[2855.44 --> 2859.44]  And it would kind of be like you're ruining the party.
[2859.44 --> 2860.44]  Right?
[2860.44 --> 2863.44]  Can't you kind of just do that somewhere else?
[2863.44 --> 2865.44]  So, she comes into this dinner.
[2865.44 --> 2867.44]  She starts crying.
[2867.44 --> 2869.44]  It's embarrassing for her.
[2869.44 --> 2871.44]  It's embarrassing for everybody.
[2871.44 --> 2875.44]  The dinner now has this awkward soundtrack of sniffling and weeping.
[2875.44 --> 2886.44]  And then she begins to bathe Jesus' feet with her tears, wiping them with her hair and kissing them and pouring perfume on them.
[2886.44 --> 2893.44]  And by the way, in that culture, if you are a woman, you do not let your hair down in public.
[2893.44 --> 2894.44]  Ever.
[2894.44 --> 2897.44]  That is scandalous.
[2897.44 --> 2903.44]  And so, remember, Simon, the Pharisee, is the host of the dinner party.
[2903.44 --> 2908.44]  And so, in verse 39, we learn what he's thinking about this.
[2908.44 --> 2926.44]  It says, when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, if this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner.
[2926.44 --> 2932.44]  Now, notice, Simon judges the woman.
[2932.44 --> 2933.44]  She is a sinner.
[2933.44 --> 2938.44]  And we can imagine the other people at this dinner are thinking the same thing.
[2938.44 --> 2947.44]  But not only does Jesus judge the woman, but his judgment of her leads him also to judge Jesus.
[2947.44 --> 2948.44]  Right?
[2948.44 --> 2949.44]  Do you see that?
[2949.44 --> 2953.44]  He must not be a prophet, Simon says.
[2953.44 --> 2957.44]  And so, in some ways, though, you know what?
[2957.44 --> 2961.44]  Simon's judgment of Jesus is understandable.
[2961.44 --> 2962.44]  Right?
[2962.44 --> 2964.44]  Jesus is a reputed holy man.
[2964.44 --> 2972.44]  And his holiness is absolutely being undermined by this woman in this situation.
[2972.44 --> 2973.44]  Right?
[2973.44 --> 2976.44]  Here is kind of the next celebrity pastor downfall.
[2976.44 --> 2984.44]  You have a known prostitute publicly touching and caressing a so-called teacher.
[2984.44 --> 2987.44]  And Jesus accepts it.
[2987.44 --> 2992.44]  Jesus, don't you know what kind of woman this is?
[2992.44 --> 2995.44]  It's a valid question, isn't it?
[2995.44 --> 3008.44]  How can Jesus be a true teacher of God's word when he is fellowshipping with those who so clearly disobey God's word?
[3008.44 --> 3016.44]  Now, Jesus gives a preliminary answer to that question in Luke chapter 5, verse 31 and 32.
[3016.44 --> 3022.44]  He says, it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
[3022.44 --> 3029.44]  I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, see that word, to repentance.
[3029.44 --> 3037.44]  So, perhaps then, Simon has misjudged Jesus and the woman.
[3037.44 --> 3038.44]  Right?
[3038.44 --> 3040.44]  What is God up to here?
[3040.44 --> 3045.44]  And that leads us to our second point this morning, the forgiving judge.
[3045.44 --> 3047.44]  So, Simon, he has judged the woman.
[3047.44 --> 3050.44]  He has judged Jesus in his heart, in his thoughts.
[3050.44 --> 3057.44]  And Jesus meets him in his very judgment by offering a judgment of his own.
[3057.44 --> 3061.44]  And he does this with a short parable.
[3061.44 --> 3062.44]  Right?
[3062.44 --> 3063.44]  Classic Jesus.
[3063.44 --> 3064.44]  Right?
[3064.44 --> 3067.44]  So, let's look at this parable in verse 41 and 42.
[3067.44 --> 3070.44]  So, he says, Simon, I have something to tell you.
[3070.44 --> 3077.44]  Now, if Jesus looks at you and says, I have something to tell you, I don't know, maybe run or buckle up.
[3077.44 --> 3078.44]  I don't know.
[3078.44 --> 3079.44]  But, here's what Jesus says.
[3079.44 --> 3083.44]  Two people owed money to a certain money lender.
[3083.44 --> 3087.44]  One owed him 500 denarii and the other 50.
[3087.44 --> 3089.44]  Neither of them had the money to pay him back.
[3089.44 --> 3091.44]  So, he forgave the debts of both.
[3091.44 --> 3093.44]  Now, which of them will love him more?
[3093.44 --> 3096.44]  Very simple, short parable.
[3096.44 --> 3098.44]  In case you have two people who owe money.
[3098.44 --> 3107.44]  And a denarius is a denarii, sorry, is a day's wage for a kind of a worker.
[3107.44 --> 3114.44]  So, we have really two or three months worth of income versus about two years.
[3114.44 --> 3117.44]  Two months versus two years of income.
[3117.44 --> 3120.44]  The thing is, neither of them had the money to pay it back.
[3120.44 --> 3124.44]  So, the money lender forgave the debts of both.
[3124.44 --> 3129.44]  Now, this parable does important work in the story.
[3129.44 --> 3130.44]  Okay?
[3130.44 --> 3134.44]  First, it tells us that only Jesus has the right to judge.
[3134.44 --> 3135.44]  Right?
[3135.44 --> 3138.44]  Jesus, in the story, sees himself as what?
[3138.44 --> 3143.44]  He is the money lender, right?
[3143.44 --> 3145.44]  He is the one who is owed.
[3145.44 --> 3149.44]  So, only he has the right to forgive the debt.
[3149.44 --> 3152.44]  Now, the Pharisees are sharp theologians.
[3152.44 --> 3156.44]  They know that only God can forgive sins.
[3156.44 --> 3161.44]  And that's why, at the end of the dinner, everyone is so shocked and asking the question,
[3161.44 --> 3165.44]  who is this who even forgives sins?
[3165.44 --> 3166.44]  Right?
[3166.44 --> 3168.44]  And so, this is part of the epiphany.
[3168.44 --> 3171.44]  Jesus' revelation of himself, his identity.
[3171.44 --> 3173.44]  He is telling them, I am God.
[3173.44 --> 3180.44]  I am the judge who has the authority to judge and to forgive sins.
[3180.44 --> 3186.44]  Now, the second thing this parable does is it actually invites Simon to repent.
[3186.44 --> 3192.44]  So, you know, it's so easy for us just to focus on the woman and Jesus forgiving the woman.
[3192.44 --> 3197.44]  But don't miss, Jesus is extending an invitation to Simon.
[3197.44 --> 3206.44]  Because Jesus is inviting him to repent of his religious pride and to also find forgiveness.
[3206.44 --> 3210.44]  Because, how many debtors are in the parable?
[3210.44 --> 3212.44]  Two.
[3212.44 --> 3213.44]  Not just one.
[3213.44 --> 3215.44]  There are two debtors.
[3215.44 --> 3217.44]  One is the woman.
[3217.44 --> 3219.44]  The other is Simon.
[3219.44 --> 3224.44]  Jesus is saying, Simon, don't you see yourself in this story?
[3224.44 --> 3225.44]  Right?
[3225.44 --> 3228.44]  You also are a debtor.
[3228.44 --> 3230.44]  You also are a sinner.
[3230.44 --> 3236.44]  And so, Jesus is challenging Simon to see himself from Jesus' perspective.
[3236.44 --> 3244.44]  You know, the thing is, see, we all like to think that there are good people in the world and bad people.
[3244.44 --> 3249.44]  And, yes, there are only two kinds of people in the world.
[3249.44 --> 3250.44]  That is true.
[3250.44 --> 3252.44]  But it's not good people and bad people.
[3252.44 --> 3253.44]  There it is.
[3253.44 --> 3262.44]  The two kinds of people are sinners who know that they are sinners and sinners who don't know that they are sinners.
[3262.44 --> 3264.44]  So, really, they're just one kind of person.
[3264.44 --> 3265.44]  Right?
[3265.44 --> 3266.44]  What?
[3266.44 --> 3267.44]  Sinners.
[3267.44 --> 3270.44]  Simon doesn't realize he is one.
[3270.44 --> 3271.44]  Right?
[3271.44 --> 3276.44]  He doesn't realize that he is like the woman that he is judging.
[3276.44 --> 3283.44]  Now, notice, though, Jesus is not saying that the woman and Simon are the same.
[3283.44 --> 3284.44]  Right?
[3284.44 --> 3290.44]  But Jesus acknowledges, and this is interesting, he acknowledges that she is more sinful than Simon.
[3290.44 --> 3296.44]  In the story, one debt is ten times larger than the other.
[3296.44 --> 3297.44]  Okay?
[3297.44 --> 3302.44]  Now, most of us would probably tend to think that Jesus would say something really egalitarian.
[3302.44 --> 3306.44]  Like, look, Simon, everyone is equally sinful before God.
[3306.44 --> 3309.44]  That's not what he says.
[3309.44 --> 3312.44]  The woman has broken more rules.
[3312.44 --> 3316.44]  She has done more bad things than Simon.
[3316.44 --> 3318.44]  They're not the same.
[3318.44 --> 3322.44]  And yet, they're both in debt because of their sin.
[3322.44 --> 3325.44]  And neither of them can forgive themselves.
[3325.44 --> 3328.44]  Neither of them can pay.
[3328.44 --> 3334.44]  So, in this parable, Jesus is saying that judgment belongs to God alone.
[3334.44 --> 3340.44]  And the other point we need to see is that at the same time that Jesus claims to have the authority to judge,
[3340.44 --> 3344.44]  he tells us that he is a judge who forgives.
[3344.44 --> 3345.44]  Okay?
[3345.44 --> 3347.44]  He pardons the debt of both.
[3347.44 --> 3349.44]  That's in the parable as well.
[3349.44 --> 3353.44]  So, not only is Jesus the true judge and not Simon,
[3353.44 --> 3359.44]  but also Jesus is far more merciful and forgiving than Simon is.
[3359.44 --> 3364.44]  You know, and that is kind of the great tragedy of the Pharisees.
[3364.44 --> 3367.44]  They knew that God was a judge.
[3367.44 --> 3371.44]  But they missed that he was a forgiving judge.
[3371.44 --> 3372.44]  Right?
[3372.44 --> 3376.44]  Even though, look, the scriptures attest to it everywhere.
[3376.44 --> 3380.44]  For example, in Exodus, God reveals himself.
[3380.44 --> 3381.44]  He reveals his name.
[3381.44 --> 3383.44]  What does he say?
[3383.44 --> 3402.44]  I am the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.
[3402.44 --> 3403.44]  Jesus is the judge.
[3403.44 --> 3405.44]  Jesus is the judge.
[3405.44 --> 3407.44]  He is the forgiving judge.
[3407.44 --> 3408.44]  He is God.
[3408.44 --> 3411.44]  And he forgives sinners.
[3411.44 --> 3416.44]  Simon saw God as the judge who judges sinners.
[3416.44 --> 3419.44]  He excluded himself from that group of people.
[3419.44 --> 3424.44]  And as a result, he is the one who receives judgment from Jesus.
[3424.44 --> 3428.44]  The woman saw Jesus as her judge.
[3428.44 --> 3433.44]  She saw herself as a sinner in need of forgiveness.
[3433.44 --> 3435.44]  And she ran to Jesus.
[3435.44 --> 3437.44]  And she received it from him.
[3437.44 --> 3441.44]  And that brings us to our final point this morning.
[3441.44 --> 3444.44]  The fruit of forgiveness.
[3444.44 --> 3445.44]  Right?
[3445.44 --> 3452.44]  Because the parable about forgiveness is finally about the fruit of forgiveness, which is what?
[3452.44 --> 3453.44]  Love.
[3453.44 --> 3464.44]  Of these two debtors, Jesus asks, who will love the money lender more once their debts are forgiven?
[3464.44 --> 3472.44]  In verse 43, it says, Simon replied, I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.
[3472.44 --> 3476.44]  You have judged correctly, Jesus said.
[3476.44 --> 3479.44]  Now, you got to know the irony here, right?
[3479.44 --> 3484.44]  It's as if Jesus is saying, that's a good judgment, Simon.
[3484.44 --> 3485.44]  Finally.
[3485.44 --> 3486.44]  Right?
[3486.44 --> 3487.44]  Finally, you've got it.
[3487.44 --> 3489.44]  Finally, you've judged correctly.
[3489.44 --> 3491.44]  Who will love more?
[3491.44 --> 3493.44]  The greater debtor.
[3493.44 --> 3501.44]  And notice what offended Simon so much about this woman.
[3501.44 --> 3504.44]  It was the touching, right?
[3504.44 --> 3509.44]  Does this man know the kind of woman that is touching him?
[3509.44 --> 3518.44]  But it is this very touching that Jesus affirms at every step in every move.
[3518.44 --> 3520.44]  So let's look at this together.
[3520.44 --> 3522.44]  Look at verse 44.
[3522.44 --> 3529.44]  Jesus says to Simon, he says, he tells the parable, and then he says, Simon, look at this woman.
[3529.44 --> 3531.44]  Do you see this woman?
[3531.44 --> 3533.44]  I came into your house.
[3533.44 --> 3540.44]  You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
[3540.44 --> 3541.44]  Right?
[3541.44 --> 3550.44]  So the common custom of the day, especially for an honored guest coming to your house, you know, is to wash their feet.
[3550.44 --> 3551.44]  It's a dirt road.
[3551.44 --> 3552.44]  There's no asphalt.
[3552.44 --> 3555.44]  You're wearing your Nikes, not sandals.
[3555.44 --> 3558.44]  Or not Nikes, you're wearing sandals.
[3558.44 --> 3565.44]  You come to a home and a servant will wash your feet, or at least water would be provided.
[3565.44 --> 3569.44]  Jesus had not received this courtesy.
[3569.44 --> 3579.44]  But this woman sacrifices her dignity to honor Jesus by wiping his feet with her hair.
[3579.44 --> 3589.44]  Verse 45, Jesus continues, you, Simon, did not give me a kiss, but this woman from the time I entered has not stopped kissing my feet.
[3589.44 --> 3596.44]  It was also common culture for the host to welcome the guest with a kiss on the cheek.
[3596.44 --> 3600.44]  Simon did not welcome Jesus in this way.
[3600.44 --> 3604.44]  But this woman is bowing before Jesus' feet.
[3604.44 --> 3607.44]  She is covering his feet with kisses.
[3607.44 --> 3611.44]  And in that time, that meant treating him like a king.
[3611.44 --> 3616.44]  When you come before a king and you show your submission to the king, what do you do?
[3616.44 --> 3618.44]  You kiss his feet.
[3618.44 --> 3620.44]  That's what she's doing.
[3620.44 --> 3622.44]  And Jesus keeps going.
[3622.44 --> 3632.44]  Verse 46, you did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
[3632.44 --> 3633.44]  Right?
[3633.44 --> 3641.44]  That alabaster jar of perfume that she carries was essential to her work as a prostitute.
[3641.44 --> 3647.44]  This expensive perfume was part of the way that she made herself desirable.
[3647.44 --> 3649.44]  This was for her work.
[3649.44 --> 3653.44]  It was probably the most valuable thing that she owned.
[3653.44 --> 3656.44]  Far more valuable than oil.
[3656.44 --> 3661.44]  And she pours it out at the feet of Jesus.
[3661.44 --> 3662.44]  Right?
[3662.44 --> 3663.44]  That's kind of all she's got.
[3663.44 --> 3667.44]  And she just pours out the entire thing on his feet.
[3667.44 --> 3669.44]  She has got nothing left.
[3669.44 --> 3672.44]  She has given him everything.
[3672.44 --> 3677.44]  Who will love more?
[3677.44 --> 3678.44]  The greater debtor.
[3678.44 --> 3680.44]  The greater debtor.
[3680.44 --> 3683.44]  So Jesus says in verse 47,
[3683.44 --> 3691.44]  Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven, as her great love has shown.
[3691.44 --> 3696.44]  But whoever has been forgiven little, loves little.
[3696.44 --> 3700.44]  And it's important that we notice the order that Jesus gives here.
[3700.44 --> 3703.44]  He says, do you see her love, Simon?
[3703.44 --> 3708.44]  The love that she is pouring out, it's because she has been forgiven.
[3708.44 --> 3714.44]  In other words, her love of Jesus is the fruit of forgiveness.
[3714.44 --> 3719.44]  Jesus says, whoever has been forgiven little, loves little.
[3719.44 --> 3724.44]  And the inverse, whoever has been forgiven much, loves much.
[3724.44 --> 3727.44]  It's a profound insight, right?
[3727.44 --> 3730.44]  So here's, think about your own life.
[3730.44 --> 3731.44]  Here's the question.
[3731.44 --> 3734.44]  Do you struggle to love?
[3734.44 --> 3737.44]  Do you struggle to love God?
[3737.44 --> 3741.44]  Do you struggle to obey his word?
[3741.44 --> 3755.44]  Well, Jesus says the way to love, the way that you can grow in love, is actually connected to how much you see that you have been forgiven by him.
[3755.44 --> 3769.44]  This woman expressed her love for Jesus physically, emotionally, economically, body and soul in the way that she can and the way she knew how.
[3769.44 --> 3774.44]  And in verse 48, Jesus says, your sins are forgiven.
[3774.44 --> 3779.44]  Which starts this murmuring, not 50 yet.
[3779.44 --> 3781.44]  Yeah, but in 48, she says, your sins are forgiven.
[3781.44 --> 3788.44]  And then as a result, everyone starts murmuring together amongst themselves, the Pharisees.
[3788.44 --> 3792.44]  And they say, who is this that even forgives sins?
[3792.44 --> 3794.44]  And what's the answer?
[3794.44 --> 3796.44]  Jesus.
[3796.44 --> 3799.44]  Jesus forgives sins.
[3799.44 --> 3808.44]  Jesus forgives the woman her debts now because later he will die for her.
[3808.44 --> 3809.44]  Right?
[3809.44 --> 3817.44]  You see, he is the forgiving judge who lays down his own life for the condemned to pay their debts.
[3817.44 --> 3826.44]  And as much as the woman, she gives herself bodily for Jesus, Jesus gives up his body for her.
[3826.44 --> 3838.44]  As much as she pours out her costly perfume, Jesus pours out his life by dying on the cross in order to offer her this forgiveness that he gives her.
[3838.44 --> 3841.44]  Who is this who forgives sins?
[3841.44 --> 3844.44]  It is the one who died for our sins.
[3844.44 --> 3846.44]  The Lord Jesus Christ.
[3846.44 --> 3848.44]  He took on our punishment.
[3848.44 --> 3849.44]  He took on our shame.
[3849.44 --> 3851.44]  He took on our condemnation.
[3851.44 --> 3855.44]  And then that question, who is this who forgives sins?
[3855.44 --> 3861.44]  That's a question that then reorients the original question that we asked.
[3861.44 --> 3862.44]  Right?
[3862.44 --> 3867.44]  Our original question was, what do I do when I can't forgive myself?
[3867.44 --> 3874.44]  And the answer is to say, I am not the one who forgives my sins.
[3874.44 --> 3875.44]  Right?
[3875.44 --> 3878.44]  Notice the sinful woman does not forgive herself.
[3878.44 --> 3880.44]  She doesn't accept herself.
[3880.44 --> 3883.44]  She doesn't say, I've just got to move on.
[3883.44 --> 3885.44]  What does she do?
[3885.44 --> 3892.44]  She goes to the one who has the authority to forgive sins.
[3892.44 --> 3893.44]  Right?
[3893.44 --> 3896.44]  She faces the grace of conviction of her sin.
[3896.44 --> 3900.44]  She faces the affliction of self-condemnation.
[3900.44 --> 3902.44]  And she runs to Jesus.
[3902.44 --> 3903.44]  Right?
[3903.44 --> 3907.44]  You see, self-forgiveness is a confusion of categories.
[3907.44 --> 3908.44]  Right?
[3908.44 --> 3912.44]  Our sins are always sins against God and God alone.
[3912.44 --> 3915.44]  And He alone has the power to forgive us.
[3915.44 --> 3916.44]  Right?
[3916.44 --> 3919.44]  And so you and I, we are not the judge of others.
[3919.44 --> 3922.44]  And we are not even the judge of ourselves.
[3922.44 --> 3925.44]  Only the Lord Jesus is.
[3925.44 --> 3926.44]  And friends, you know what?
[3926.44 --> 3928.44]  But that is good news.
[3928.44 --> 3935.44]  Because God is so much more gracious and merciful than you or I will ever be.
[3935.44 --> 3937.44]  Even to ourselves.
[3937.44 --> 3943.44]  In the gospel of Jesus, He offers us true forgiveness.
[3943.44 --> 3945.44]  He offers us true peace.
[3945.44 --> 3951.44]  Not that, not a kind of a forgiveness that will resurface because actually it's just, we're just stuffing it down.
[3951.44 --> 3952.44]  But true forgiveness.
[3952.44 --> 3953.44]  True freedom.
[3953.44 --> 3957.44]  And notice Jesus' last statement in verse 50.
[3957.44 --> 3961.44]  Jesus said to the woman, your faith has saved you.
[3961.44 --> 3962.44]  Go in peace.
[3962.44 --> 3968.44]  Friends, do you want peace?
[3968.44 --> 3969.44]  Right?
[3969.44 --> 3973.44]  The peace to know that there's no longer any condemnation.
[3973.44 --> 3976.44]  Come to Him.
[3976.44 --> 3978.44]  He is the one who forgives.
[3978.44 --> 3979.44]  Right?
[3979.44 --> 3982.44]  And this woman, she stopped at nothing to be near Jesus.
[3982.44 --> 3985.44]  She disregarded the social stigma.
[3985.44 --> 3989.44]  She pushed through the crowd until she was at Jesus' feet.
[3989.44 --> 3996.44]  And she stayed there because at His feet, her sins, which were many, were forgiven.
[3996.44 --> 3999.44]  Okay, let's pray together.
[3999.44 --> 4000.44]  Let's pray together.
[4000.44 --> 4001.44]  Let's pray together.
[4001.44 --> 4002.44]  Let's pray together.
[4002.44 --> 4005.44]  Oh Lord, would you make us like this woman?
[4005.44 --> 4009.44]  Would we not be satisfied with self-forgiveness?
[4009.44 --> 4015.44]  Would you instead give us a feast of your grace and your mercy?
[4015.44 --> 4022.44]  Would we see in ourselves, Lord, the depths of our sin and our great debt to you?
[4022.44 --> 4034.44]  And would we sit at your feet and would you pronounce your good judgment over us, that by grace, through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ, our sins are forgiven.
[4034.44 --> 4037.44]  And that we would be at peace.
[4037.44 --> 4039.44]  In Christ's name we pray.
[4039.44 --> 4040.44]  Amen.
[4040.44 --> 4049.44]  So our song of response, and you can all stand as we sing this, is You Are My King.
[4049.44 --> 4050.44]  Amazing love.
[4050.44 --> 4052.44]  Let's stand and sing.
[4070.44 --> 4083.44]  I am forgiven because You were forsaken.
[4083.44 --> 4084.44]  I am accepted.
[4084.44 --> 4085.44]  You were condemned.
[4085.44 --> 4091.44]  I am forgiven because You were forsaken.
[4091.44 --> 4092.44]  I am alive and well.
[4092.44 --> 4112.44]  Your spirit is within me because You died and rose again.
[4112.44 --> 4113.44]  Amazing love.
[4113.44 --> 4114.44]  Amazing love.
[4114.44 --> 4125.44]  How can it be that You, my King, would die for me?
[4125.44 --> 4127.44]  Amazing love.
[4127.44 --> 4132.44]  I know it's true.
[4132.44 --> 4137.44]  And it's my joy to honor You.
[4137.44 --> 4138.44]  In all I do.
[4138.44 --> 4139.44]  I know it's true.
[4139.44 --> 4140.44]  And it's my joy to honor You.
[4140.44 --> 4141.44]  In all I do.
[4141.44 --> 4142.44]  I know it's true.
[4142.44 --> 4143.44]  In all I do.
[4143.44 --> 4144.44]  I know it's true.
[4144.44 --> 4145.44]  I know it's true.
[4145.44 --> 4147.44]  And it's my joy to honor You.
[4147.44 --> 4154.44]  In all I do.
[4154.44 --> 4155.44]  I know it's true.
[4155.44 --> 4156.44]  You are my King.
[4156.44 --> 4157.44]  I know it's true.
[4157.44 --> 4159.44]  And it's my joy to honor You.
[4159.44 --> 4161.44]  And I know it's true.
[4161.44 --> 4162.44]  Amazing love.
[4162.44 --> 4165.44]  I know it's true.
[4165.44 --> 4170.44]  And it's my joy to honor You.
[4170.44 --> 4171.44]  In all I do.
[4171.44 --> 4175.44]  I honor You.
[4175.44 --> 4178.44]  You are my King.
[4178.68 --> 4185.66]  Jesus, you are my King.
[4186.30 --> 4191.44]  You are my King.
[4192.74 --> 4198.44]  Jesus, you are my King.
[4198.44 --> 4212.44]  Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me?
[4212.44 --> 4219.44]  Amazing love, I know it's true.
[4219.44 --> 4228.30]  And it's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[4228.88 --> 4235.38]  I honor you in all I do.
[4235.38 --> 4238.88]  I honor you.
[4249.44 --> 4262.44]  Thank you.
[4262.44 --> 4267.34]  As I mentioned earlier, the offering this morning is for Therefore Go Ministries.
[4267.34 --> 4271.18]  And I think we will sing a song during that offertory.
[4271.64 --> 4272.68]  The deacons can come forward.
[4279.44 --> 4296.74]  Faithful one, so unchanging.
[4298.88 --> 4306.90]  Ageless one, you're my rock of peace.
[4306.90 --> 4313.90]  Lord of all, I depend on you.
[4315.64 --> 4322.40]  I call out to you again and again.
[4324.40 --> 4330.90]  I call out to you again and again.
[4330.90 --> 4340.46]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[4340.46 --> 4349.60]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[4349.60 --> 4353.60]  All through the storm.
[4353.60 --> 4361.60]  Your love is the anchor.
[4361.60 --> 4368.60]  My hope is in you alone.
[4368.60 --> 4377.60]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[4377.60 --> 4378.60]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[4378.60 --> 4384.60]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[4384.60 --> 4386.60]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[4386.60 --> 4390.60]  All through the storm.
[4390.60 --> 4398.60]  Your love is the anchor.
[4398.60 --> 4405.60]  My hope is in you alone.
[4405.60 --> 4415.46]  ...
[4415.46 --> 4419.84]  ...
[4419.84 --> 4422.60]  ...
[4422.60 --> 4424.10]  ...
[4424.10 --> 4425.30]  ...
[4425.30 --> 4430.16]  Very nice singing to everyone and you guys in particular.
[4430.82 --> 4432.18]  I really like the worship today.
[4432.30 --> 4436.22]  It's just felt very kind of calm and meditative and just focused on the words.
[4436.34 --> 4436.74]  It's been great.
[4437.66 --> 4439.98]  So we come to God now in a time of prayer.
[4441.14 --> 4445.68]  And I'll begin by just reading a few verses from Psalm 22.
[4446.48 --> 4450.82]  And then we will conclude by saying the Lord's Prayer together out loud.
[4450.82 --> 4452.94]  Okay, so let's please join me in prayer.
[4455.30 --> 4459.60]  I will declare your name to my people.
[4460.10 --> 4462.08]  In the assembly I will praise you.
[4463.14 --> 4465.48]  You who fear the Lord, praise him.
[4466.34 --> 4469.24]  All you descendants of Jacob, honor him.
[4470.38 --> 4473.20]  Revere him, all you descendants of Israel.
[4474.02 --> 4477.92]  For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted.
[4477.92 --> 4484.92]  He has not hidden his face from him, but has listened to his cry for help.
[4485.30 --> 4491.42]  Dear Lord, we thank you and we praise you for being the everlasting God.
[4492.36 --> 4496.12]  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[4496.86 --> 4502.74]  The God who assembles your people and who is worthy of all of our praise.
[4503.02 --> 4508.30]  The God who acts with justice and shows us much more grace than we could ever imagine.
[4508.30 --> 4514.32]  Lord, when we look at the world around us, we see signs of brokenness and sin.
[4515.74 --> 4518.76]  Ultimately, Lord, we see a world that is at war with you.
[4519.90 --> 4523.14]  And Lord, we are part of this world and also our hearts.
[4524.58 --> 4526.76]  Lord, sometimes they war with you as well.
[4526.94 --> 4532.48]  And so we pray that you would bring us the peace that comes from being in a right relationship with you.
[4532.48 --> 4533.78]  The God of the universe.
[4534.04 --> 4535.42]  The God of our salvation.
[4536.82 --> 4542.06]  Lord, as we come to you, help us to learn from you to love all of those who are around us.
[4542.66 --> 4544.64]  Those who we meet along the way.
[4545.88 --> 4549.48]  Lead us to your gentle and lowly heart.
[4550.18 --> 4552.04]  So that in all that we say and do.
[4552.26 --> 4555.96]  In all the places where our lives intersect with the world.
[4555.96 --> 4565.82]  Lord, that we may, to all of those that we meet, that they would receive from us your invitation to life.
[4566.30 --> 4568.84]  Your invitation to forgiveness and mercy.
[4570.28 --> 4573.66]  Almighty God, you emptied your life to give us life.
[4574.42 --> 4576.80]  So Lord, would you free us from the yoke of self.
[4577.44 --> 4582.72]  So that in you and with you, we might be faithful servants in our Father's kingdom.
[4582.72 --> 4589.96]  Lord, as we look back on 2023, we've seen the ways that we have strayed from your ways.
[4590.62 --> 4591.86]  Lord, we ask for your forgiveness.
[4593.12 --> 4599.56]  Help us, Lord, to serve you better in the year ahead with courage and love, conviction.
[4601.02 --> 4605.42]  Lord, we pray for our church and for the needs among the congregation.
[4606.38 --> 4608.60]  Lord, help us together to build up the weak.
[4608.60 --> 4612.78]  Lord, we pray for our people to serve the poor, to proclaim the gospel to the lost.
[4613.58 --> 4615.12]  And to serve our city as well.
[4615.90 --> 4622.50]  Lord, we pray that you would be with Jason and Michaela as they continue to grieve the loss of their son Samuel, who was still born.
[4623.96 --> 4633.22]  Lord, would you be ever more close to them in this deep trial with your love and with your comfort.
[4633.22 --> 4642.84]  Lord, we thank you for our hope that we are not our own, but belong body and soul and life and in death to our faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[4643.34 --> 4649.70]  Whether our life was all too short or whether you give us a long life.
[4651.60 --> 4656.10]  Lord, be you also with the family that continues to fight with cancer.
[4657.26 --> 4658.40]  Lord, you know who they are.
[4658.40 --> 4673.18]  Lord, we pray for others in our congregation who are not well in this time of year when colds and flus go around.
[4673.98 --> 4679.04]  Keep us all in good health and give us the grace to continue to serve your purposes in our lives.
[4680.14 --> 4686.70]  Lord, to all those who are struggling with pain of various sorts, Lord, would you have mercy.
[4686.70 --> 4690.70]  Be close to those facing anxiety.
[4691.92 --> 4694.44]  Give wisdom to those who are facing many questions.
[4696.00 --> 4703.30]  And Lord, we pray all of these things, bringing our prayers before you as one, as the Lord Jesus taught us to pray, sing together.
[4704.06 --> 4707.76]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4708.42 --> 4712.82]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4712.82 --> 4715.82]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[4716.32 --> 4721.86]  And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4722.10 --> 4726.22]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4726.76 --> 4731.96]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4732.60 --> 4733.02]  Amen.
[4733.02 --> 4738.40]  Now, friends, please rise and receive the benediction.
[4738.56 --> 4743.06]  Again, as John mentioned, we'll have a time of fellowship through the doors.
[4744.16 --> 4748.80]  There also are cross-training adult education, discipleship classes.
[4748.80 --> 4751.78]  We'll be starting up two weeks, I think.
[4752.14 --> 4753.18]  I'm going to share, check your bulletin.
[4753.36 --> 4754.86]  You can sign up on the sign-up sheet.
[4755.22 --> 4758.12]  It's going to be on the topic of the unseen world, angels.
[4758.12 --> 4761.72]  And they'll be very fascinating.
[4761.86 --> 4763.54]  So I invite you all to come.
[4764.50 --> 4767.48]  Now, I invite you to hold out your hands and receive God's blessing.
[4768.08 --> 4770.12]  To him who is able to keep you from stumbling.
[4770.98 --> 4774.84]  And to present you before his glorious presence without fault.
[4775.70 --> 4776.58]  And with great joy.
[4777.46 --> 4779.14]  To the only God, our Savior.
[4779.78 --> 4782.38]  Be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[4782.84 --> 4787.16]  Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, before all ages, now, and forevermore.
[4787.16 --> 4788.18]  Amen.
[4817.16 --> 4826.16]  Day after day, the Savior brings forever and forever.
[4827.16 --> 4832.22]  One generation will call to the next.
[4832.72 --> 4837.94]  Our God is good and is and is strong.
[4837.94 --> 4843.50]  All of the world sings his heart from his eyes.
[4843.94 --> 4851.94]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4852.94 --> 4857.94]  Great is the Lord in all his ways.
[4858.94 --> 4864.00]  He's greatly to be praised.
[4864.00 --> 4866.00]  His goodness.
[4866.00 --> 4867.00]  He's great.
[4867.00 --> 4870.00]  He's great.
[4870.00 --> 4871.00]  His grace.
[4871.00 --> 4875.22]  His greatness none could fathom.
[4876.00 --> 4880.90]  One generation will call to the next.
[4881.00 --> 4886.64]  Our God is good and his hand is strong.
[4886.64 --> 4900.14]  All of the world sings his marvelous hands, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4900.14 --> 4925.14]  Now may your name be sung in every time, in every place, singing the flame of your prayer, love, in every generation.
[4925.14 --> 4937.14]  One generation will come to the next, our God is good and his hand is strong.
[4937.14 --> 4952.14]  All of the world sings his marvelous hands, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4955.14 --> 4960.14]  All of the world sings his song, and his voice will be sung by the name of his voice.
[4960.14 --> 4967.14]  Now may your name be sung by the name of his voice, but his voice will be sung by the name of his voice.
[4967.14 --> 4971.14]  All of the world sings his voice.
[4971.14 --> 4977.14]  The song is sung by the name of his voice.
