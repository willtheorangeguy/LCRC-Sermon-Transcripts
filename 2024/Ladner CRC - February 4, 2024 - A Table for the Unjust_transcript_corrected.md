[211.94 → 213.16] Well, good morning.
[213.66 → 214.08] Good morning.
[214.54 → 216.44] And welcome everyone to our service today.
[216.74 → 222.08] My name is Jake Iron, and I'll be leading us through the so-called liturgical elements of our service this morning
[222.08 → 225.10] before Pastor Jason leads us in exploring God's Word.
[225.10 → 231.92] I really only have one announcement this morning before we begin, and that's to draw your attention to what's in the bulletin
[231.92 → 237.34] about the special showing of the movie Sight tonight, right here in Sanctuary, 6 p.m.
[237.34 → 245.88] And it's a story of Dr. Ming Wang and his journey from China in the 80s to education in the U.S.
[245.88 → 255.74] to become a world-renowned eye surgeon and his work, philanthropic work, with providing surgery or eyesight to orphans worldwide.
[255.74 → 263.84] And my understanding is Dr. Wang will actually be present as well for Q&A there, so definitely a worthwhile event to come to.
[263.84 → 270.24] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 86.
[270.84 → 273.78] Among the gods there is none like you, Lord.
[274.42 → 276.46] No deeds can compare with yours.
[277.32 → 281.08] All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.
[281.68 → 286.70] They will bring glory to your name, for you are great and do marvellous deeds.
[287.36 → 288.58] You alone are God.
[288.98 → 292.54] I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart.
[292.54 → 297.34] I will glorify your name forever, for great is your love toward me.
[298.20 → 299.16] Please join me in prayer.
[303.34 → 309.04] Mighty God, open once more the heavens and send forth your renewing Holy Spirit.
[309.86 → 316.58] Speak to us this day so that we might hear and respond in joy as we worship your Son, Jesus Christ.
[316.58 → 321.72] Baptize us with your delight that we might know that we belong to you.
[322.38 → 324.42] In Jesus' precious name, amen.
[326.20 → 330.18] Now is a good time to stand, if you are able, and greet those around you.
[330.18 → 336.68] God bless my God, give us a good time for you.
[337.74 → 338.18] Amen.
[338.84 → 339.74] Amen.
[339.80 → 339.94] Amen.

[357.58 → 357.94] Amen.
[357.98 → 359.86] Amen.
[360.18 → 390.16] Thank you.
[390.18 → 399.64] Come out of every blessing, to my heart to sing thy praise.
[400.00 → 408.90] Streams of mercy never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise.
[408.90 → 417.90] Teach me some loudest song, some fleeting tones above.
[417.90 → 428.30] Praise the mountain, fix upon it, mountain cross to retain in love.
[429.70 → 437.90] Here I raise my heavenly, sir, in you I, I am my crown.
[437.90 → 448.04] And I hope I, by good measure, send me to a private home.
[448.04 → 458.18] Jesus sought me with a stranger, wandering from the hold of God.
[458.58 → 467.82] He to rescue me from danger, he to boast his precious blood.
[467.82 → 477.82] Oh, to praise the great adventurer, in the eye of the strength to be.
[478.78 → 486.82] Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter, find my wandering heart to thee.
[486.82 → 492.74] Go to water, Lord, I feel it.
[493.08 → 497.28] Go to leave the blood I love.
[497.96 → 502.68] Here's my heart, Lord, take it, seal it.
[503.10 → 507.48] Seal it forth, my courts have come.
[507.48 → 532.58] O God, before the mountain turn the floor.
[532.58 → 539.94] For days of spring and summer fill the earth.
[539.94 → 548.58] From everlasting you are mine.
[548.58 → 578.56] You are mine.
[578.58 → 580.58] Your health.
[580.58 → 586.58] Your perfect love and favour have no aid.
[586.58 → 592.58] We rest within the wisdom of your prayer.
[592.58 → 598.58] Everlasting God.
[598.58 → 600.66] God.
[602.58 → 604.64] O God.
[607.16 → 607.78] God.
[607.78 → 608.12] God.
[608.12 → 609.00] Amen.
[609.00 → 613.58] Yea.
[613.58 → 615.46] You are mine.
[615.58 → 616.38] I moment.
[616.38 → 618.58] For days of week...
[618.58 → 619.66] Pray out.
[619.66 → 622.58] For days of spring and coming...

[1136.18 → 1166.16] We're right back.
[1166.16 → 1196.14] We're right back.
[1196.16 → 1226.14] We're right back.
[1226.16 → 1256.14] We're right back.
[1256.16 → 1286.14] We're right back.
[1286.16 → 1316.14] We're right back.
[1316.16 → 1346.14] We're right back.
[1346.16 → 1376.14] We're right back.
[1376.14 → 1406.12] We're right back.
[1406.12 → 1406.14] 
[1436.14 → 1466.10] We're right back.
[1466.10 → 1496.08] We're right back.
[1496.08 → 1526.06] We're right back.
[1526.06 → 1556.04] since Jesus was coming.
[1556.04 → 1586.02] We're right back.
[1586.02 → 1616.00] as we're right.
[1616.00 → 1645.98] might be your faithful,
[1645.98 → 1675.96] It is true.
[1675.96 → 1705.94] It's a busy city.
[1705.94 → 1735.92] We're right back.
[1735.92 → 1765.90] to deliver people,
[1765.90 → 1795.88] this is the Messiah.
[1795.88 → 1825.86] ready for the road,
[1825.86 → 1855.84] would break,
[1855.84 → 1885.82] He looks pious,
[1885.82 → 1915.80] He's turning into a mob,
[1915.80 → 1945.80] He's up,
[1945.80 → 1975.78] He's climbed up,
[1975.78 → 2005.76] the man,
[2005.76 → 2035.74] He's doing the people,
[2035.74 → 2065.72] He's a little guy,
[2065.72 → 2095.70] with one of the man,
[2095.70 → 2125.68] He's doing,
[2125.68 → 2155.66] So that's the crowd,
[2155.66 → 2185.64] Do you think it's easy,
[2185.64 → 2215.62] if they're the people,
[2215.62 → 2245.62] I'd appreciate that,
[2245.62 → 2275.60] You are a thief, you're right,
[2275.60 → 2305.60] sure,
[2305.60 → 2305.62] 
[2335.60 → 2365.60] but if there's,
[2365.60 → 2395.58] look at the crowd, you know,
[2395.58 → 2396.06] and Esc alary, and he's,
[2425.58 → 2432.54] you are so pleased to welcome him to your house, but it feels different from all those other times
[2432.54 → 2440.06] when you just wanted to show off how great of a host you can be with Jesus you are actually aware
[2440.06 → 2449.34] that he is doing you a favour rather than the other way around and as you break bread at the table he
[2449.34 → 2458.30] seems to know everything about you, he knows what makes you tick he isn't fooled by the stories you
[2458.30 → 2468.22] tell yourself he knows that actually you are afraid and yet even though he knows everything
[2469.26 → 2477.90] he doesn't seem eager to condemn you whatsoever and rather than deny it all the terrible
[2477.90 → 2487.34] things you've done it's a relief to agree with him and to be honest yes I have been an absolute weasel
[2488.14 → 2495.50] a turncoat I am outside the people of Israel I have robbed people and I found it was easier
[2495.50 → 2501.66] to rob people the poorer and the weaker they were I've only been thinking about myself
[2501.66 → 2510.38] and so you listen to this rabbi, and you can tell that he knows what he is talking about
[2511.26 → 2517.02] even though everything he says just seems to turn the tried and true ways of the world upside down
[2518.70 → 2524.70] what he says is so simple and yet it seems like the most profound thing that you have ever heard
[2524.70 → 2535.10] and suddenly you see now that you weren't wealthy before not in any way that mattered and so
[2535.10 → 2543.02] you want to give it all away your heart feels like a dam that is about to burst you'll give a tenth of it
[2543.02 → 2550.94] away oh wait no, no that's not enough you'll give a quarter of it away wait no that's still not enough I will
[2550.94 → 2558.22] give away half of my possessions and if anybody can remind me of how I've ripped them off I will pay them
[2558.22 → 2569.50] back four times what I took this seems to please Jesus you can see it in his eyes and in his smile
[2570.62 → 2576.38] and you find it almost embarrassing how much you want to please this rabbi
[2576.38 → 2585.82] pleasing Jesus seems about the most rewarding thing that you have ever done in your whole life
[2587.74 → 2599.50] and he speaks approvingly of you, and he speaks with a sort of authoritative approval he declares that
[2599.50 → 2608.30] salvation has come to your house and that word salvation it fits the joy that you are experiencing you are
[2608.30 → 2617.74] truly free who would have thought that giving away all that money would lead to freedom and deliverance
[2619.42 → 2626.14] and then really it's almost too much then he says for everyone to hear
[2626.14 → 2631.18] he says that you really are a child of Abraham
[2634.86 → 2643.26] so that's the crowd and that's packages now let's see if we can look at the story we got to be careful
[2643.26 → 2648.14] here let's see if we can look at this story from the perspective of Jesus
[2648.14 → 2652.78] you're Jesus right okay
[2655.34 → 2664.06] Jesus is the long-awaited messiah even though his life fulfills his father's will
[2664.94 → 2669.58] and the writings of the prophets his people do not recognize him
[2669.58 → 2677.34] they were expecting something more regal, but he has come as a servant
[2678.94 → 2687.18] and their eyes just cannot see that he is the king his works of power his teachings of truth
[2687.74 → 2695.50] they surprise people they the people feel threatened by him or angered by him or confused by him
[2695.50 → 2705.10] they think that he doesn't care about the Jewish religion whereas he loves it and understands it better than anybody
[2707.98 → 2714.54] his people have lost their way they have lost their way in all kinds of different ways
[2714.54 → 2726.70] and he has come to seek and save the lost his favourite way to be with people to minister to the sinners and the outcasts
[2727.34 → 2733.74] is by sharing a meal with them, it's a picture of what his kingdom is really about
[2733.74 → 2743.58] and now he is on pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the passover this will be the last time
[2745.26 → 2751.58] the spirit has been telling him what is about to happen, but his disciples do not accept this
[2752.22 → 2761.42] they do not understand it perhaps they refuse to understand it he shall be lifted and draw all people to
[2761.42 → 2770.70] himself but not in the way they expect he is going to suffer for the guilt of these people who complain
[2771.34 → 2781.74] against him, he is going to fulfill the laws of Moses about sacrifice this is how the guilty are made innocent
[2781.74 → 2793.66] this is how the dirty and the unclean are made pure this is how the unjust are made justified this is the actual passover
[2794.22 → 2802.70] that all the other passovers throughout the centuries have all pointed to this is the real day of atonement
[2802.70 → 2810.54] the serpent and finally the serpent is going to be crushed by the seed of the woman
[2812.94 → 2821.58] today though today he has other work to do there's not much time left only about 10 more days until the cross
[2821.58 → 2832.38] but he has an appointment with a man named packages no this man doesn't know him even though Jesus has known
[2832.38 → 2841.10] this man from before the foundation of the world the man has been lost, but he is ready to be found
[2841.10 → 2853.82] the man has been dead, but he is ready to be made alive and born of the spirit he has acted unjustly
[2854.78 → 2862.14] but he is ready to make restitution packages he's ready to be healed and cleansed and forgiven
[2863.10 → 2870.70] he is ready to leave the slavery of that tiny little kingdom of self and enter into the new freedom
[2870.70 → 2878.14] of the spirit of the kingdom of god he has been alone and outside the people of god
[2879.02 → 2883.74] but he is ready now to become into the fellowship of the children of god
[2886.54 → 2895.34] Jesus is on his way to passover, but he has time for packages and as Jesus breaks bread at packages's table
[2895.34 → 2905.02] the life-giving power and presence of Jesus breaks in and there is truth and there is shalom and Jesus
[2905.02 → 2916.86] pronounces what Jesus only can pronounce that salvation has come because he has come he has come to rescue
[2916.86 → 2928.22] someone who did not deserve it and Jesus declares a new son of father Abraham and the angels of god in heaven rejoice
[2931.66 → 2940.38] so three perspectives to one little story right the crowd packages and Jesus and now
[2940.38 → 2948.62] before we conclude or as we conclude let's think about how you and I fit into this story
[2950.78 → 2957.26] well first it's easy for us to join those grumblers and those complainers of the crowd
[2958.22 → 2967.66] right even sometimes within the church sometimes we can be upset at god's grace right to people who we
[2967.66 → 2976.14] don't think deserve it you know god's grace can be so irritating he doesn't seem to have good taste in
[2976.14 → 2987.34] people right the kind of people that he attracts are not my kind of people friends do you shake your head
[2987.34 → 2994.06] at the kind of people Jesus welcomes into his kingdom what does that tell you about how
[2994.06 → 2999.50] your understanding of grace and of god's of in of the gospel
[3001.58 → 3008.38] second brothers and sisters you need to pause for a moment, and you need to check to see if you are
[3008.38 → 3018.62] packages right are you up in a tree all alone looking down at those fools down there below you making excuses
[3018.62 → 3025.42] for your behaviour you know every single one of us in this room has done shameful things
[3026.30 → 3033.74] every one of us has acted in unjust ways but whether it's something that you've said or done
[3033.74 → 3039.50] that is hidden in the shadows and no one knows about it or whether it's out in the open and well known
[3040.54 → 3048.54] friends Jesus wants to draw near to you Jesus comes to you, and he says I must stay in your
[3048.54 → 3057.42] house today he wants to draw close to you and wouldn't it be a relief to just drop the defensiveness
[3058.22 → 3067.50] and come down but I do warn you when Jesus comes to stay with you, you may find him leading you into the
[3067.50 → 3075.34] hard work of repair and restoration see on the one hand the gospel friends is for
[3075.34 → 3083.74] it's an offer of salvation to anyone who would receive it right there is no unjust thing that
[3083.74 → 3089.42] you have done there's no pit so deep that the love of god and the salvation of Christ cannot reach it
[3090.62 → 3096.70] Jesus went to the cross, and he bore all of our sin to welcome us into his kingdom
[3096.70 → 3106.14] but on the other hand Jesus is never satisfied to just leave you where you are because he loves you
[3107.34 → 3115.58] and he seeks in his love to actually draw you close to him and to change you to make you more like himself
[3116.94 → 3124.62] right when packages met Jesus he said to the lord look lord here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor
[3124.62 → 3134.78] and what packages is doing is profoundly biblical right he is going to now obey the law of god
[3135.42 → 3140.78] he is going to live by the law that god had given his people way back in Leviticus that we read
[3141.42 → 3149.90] right to make restitution to the people he has stolen from and so what we should see is that this is
[3150.54 → 3157.90] the only right response to having received the love of god right is to go about then doing the work of
[3157.90 → 3165.90] restoration healing restoring anything that we have broken whether it's a relationship whether we have
[3165.90 → 3173.82] stolen something whether we have harmed anybody when we receive the love of god we go, and we make repair
[3173.82 → 3181.42] so friends are you ready to believe in Jesus because he knows you better than you know yourself
[3182.86 → 3189.42] and are you ready to follow him in a way that very well might stand your entire world on its head
[3191.98 → 3195.98] and lastly is there any way that we can stand in the perspective of Jesus
[3195.98 → 3206.54] yes absolutely there is because you see Jesus was given a mission by his father to do what to seek and
[3206.54 → 3216.14] to save the lost and so for us what does it mean for us to follow Jesus it is to do as he did it is to
[3216.14 → 3224.62] seek and save the lost it is to move towards the unjust of this world of our neighbours with the grace
[3225.66 → 3235.26] of Jesus just as he did we the people of god now join in the same mission that Jesus had, and we bring
[3235.26 → 3244.78] the messiah to them because the message of Jesus is for the unjust and the sinner so let me pray for
[3244.78 → 3254.22] us please join me in prayer heavenly father we thank you for sending your son the messiah he is the long
[3254.22 → 3262.62] awaited king, and we thank you that we can be reconciled to you through the blood of Jesus Christ
[3264.06 → 3271.10] and we ask that you would give us the same grace that we have received that we would love sinners as
[3271.10 → 3279.42] well lord give us the same desire to find people who have gotten lost and lord would you draw us and
[3279.42 → 3286.14] all your people to yourself and lord make it our greatest desire and joy to please you in all things
[3286.78 → 3288.70] we pray in Jesus name amen
[3292.30 → 3295.10] all right let's stand, and we'll sing I think it's a new song

[3539.80 → 3547.22] It is a program that tries to provide seed money to congregations across Canada for ministries
[3547.22 → 3552.36] that would otherwise be not possible for them to execute just because of lack of funds.

[3721.80 → 3722.80] Thank you.
[3722.80 → 3729.54] presence. We pause in silence to acknowledge the praises of our hearts for your promises
[3729.54 → 3731.28] and provisions to us.
[3743.60 → 3749.26] Guiding Lord, our scripture reminds us of our need to follow Christ so we might daily
[3749.26 → 3754.92] be in his light rather than lost in the temptations of the darkness. Create a yearning within us
[3754.92 → 3760.46] as individuals and as a church so that we might delight in your will and desire to follow
[3760.46 → 3768.08] your ways. Grant us this awareness whether we are at school, at work, at home, or in the
[3768.08 → 3775.08] community. Increase our consistency that our light might not flicker or fade but burn brightly
[3775.08 → 3782.18] for others to see. Merciful God, we seek your healing light to shine upon those who are
[3782.18 → 3791.08] facing surgery or awaiting test results or whose healing process is slower than expected.
[3791.08 → 3797.00] Overcome any fears of darkness with the light of Christ's presence and promises. We pray
[3797.00 → 3802.62] especially for those in our congregation suffering from the devastating effects of cancer and pray
[3802.62 → 3809.38] for your healing intervention for those facing treatments. Give strength and comfort to those
[3809.38 → 3816.32] whose treatments have been unsuccessful and now face different, more intense treatments.
[3816.32 → 3822.72] Dispel the darkness for those who may doubt and wrestle with the hard questions of life.
[3822.72 → 3829.36] We continue to pray for an end to war. The ongoing war in Ukraine, now two years on, seems to have
[3829.36 → 3834.64] no end in sight and the conflicts in the Middle East seem to ready to explode into wider conflict
[3834.64 → 3842.60] each day. May you grant wisdom and intention to the leaders involved within or with ability
[3842.60 → 3849.12] to influence these conflicts that there may be a path to peace formed for both these regions.
[3849.12 → 3856.12] Gracious Lord, we cannot escape the responsibilities that are ours because we know your liberating light.
[3856.12 → 3863.88] Each day we are surrounded by many people who struggle and stumble in the darkness. May we not selfishly
[3863.88 → 3871.24] hoard the light but instead willingly reflect it to others. May our speech and actions mirror your glory as
[3871.24 → 3879.72] we repeat Christ's wonderful story. Arouse our courage and revive our boldness that our efforts of ministry
[3879.72 → 3887.48] might be multiplied to spread the good name of Jesus to others. We also remember our missionaries scattered
[3887.48 → 3893.56] about the globe who serve as an extension of this congregation. Grant them the encouragement and support
[3893.56 → 3900.68] they need for the challenges that they face. We especially remember the Ummahani and their work within
[3900.68 → 3905.96] Resonate Global Ministries. Please bless them in their efforts to spread your message in Egypt.
[3905.96 → 3915.72] Be near us Lord through this coming week. Help us to be effective servants to you and that the focus of our lives
[3915.72 → 3922.76] is to give you glory and advance your kingdom. We offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate
[3922.76 → 3927.72] name of Jesus, the light of the world. Amen.
[3927.72 → 3943.08] Let's stand.
[3946.36 → 3950.28] So please do join us for a time of fellowship right after the service in the fellowship hall
[3950.28 → 3958.60] and look forward to chatting with you catching up. If you are new, I'd love to meet you. Please do introduce
[3958.60 → 3964.92] yourself and let's go out with the Lord's blessing upon us. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3964.92 → 3971.24] the love of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with each of us now and forever. Amen.
[3971.24 → 3985.56] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.

[4051.52 → 4054.18] May the peace that you can
[4054.18 → 4056.72] change the way that we live.
[4057.20 → 4059.66] We receive our blessing
[4059.66 → 4063.42] as we live today.
