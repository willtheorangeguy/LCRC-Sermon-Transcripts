[0.00 --> 2.00]  Music
[2.00 --> 18.00]  Good morning.
[18.00 --> 20.00]  Good morning.
[20.00 --> 22.00]  Good morning.
[22.00 --> 28.00]  Well, the weatherman last night said it was going to be raining really hard this morning, so it's not.
[28.00 --> 30.00]  So we take whatever good news we can.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  So good morning to you all.
[32.00 --> 34.00]  Nice to see you all here again.
[34.00 --> 36.00]  And I'm looking around the room.
[36.00 --> 38.00]  I'm starting to see poppies up here.
[38.00 --> 40.00]  I wonder what that's about.
[40.00 --> 42.00]  Welcome to Ladner CRC.
[42.00 --> 46.00]  I'm John Smith, as most of you know, and I will lead you in the early parts of this service.
[46.00 --> 50.00]  We also welcome any of you who may be visitors here this morning.
[50.00 --> 55.00]  And we also welcome those who may be still coming in on our YouTube channel.
[55.00 --> 59.00]  Lest you think, well, COVID's over and they must have all gone away.
[59.00 --> 63.00]  I checked last night and we still get 40 to 60 views every single week.
[63.00 --> 67.00]  So good morning to you as well.
[67.00 --> 73.00]  If you are a visitor here, you might not know that we have coffee and tea in a time of fellowship after the service.
[73.00 --> 79.00]  And we encourage you to stick around, let us know who you are, and say hello.
[79.00 --> 83.00]  Pastor Jason Truel will continue his sermon series today.
[83.00 --> 85.00]  It's based on Romans.
[85.00 --> 89.00]  The title I read this morning is Judgment by Works.
[89.00 --> 90.00]  It sounds worrisome.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  I'm waiting to see what that's about.
[92.00 --> 108.00]  Before we begin, Marian Vandriel has several items she wants to highlight this morning.
[108.00 --> 110.00]  Good morning.
[110.00 --> 111.00]  I have three announcements.
[111.00 --> 114.00]  I'll try to be as brief as possible, at least with the first two.
[114.00 --> 121.00]  Today is your last chance to sign the card for Hannah that's going to Greece this week.
[121.00 --> 124.00]  So, look, there's still room on the back.
[124.00 --> 127.00]  So if you want to send a word of encouragement, today is the day.
[127.00 --> 131.00]  It'll be on the table in the foyer after the service for you to do so.
[131.00 --> 137.00]  Also, last week we received our World Renew gift catalogues.
[137.00 --> 144.00]  And it's not too soon to start your Christmas shopping with your World Renew catalog.
[144.00 --> 149.00]  There are gifts for every budget and every passion.
[149.00 --> 155.00]  So if you want to help someone start their own business, or if you want to help educate,
[155.00 --> 159.00]  provide basic daily needs for someone, it's all here.
[159.00 --> 165.00]  If you have a small group, or maybe you want to pool your resources,
[165.00 --> 167.00]  to choose a greater gift, a larger gift.
[167.00 --> 170.00]  Maybe the kids' life want to do a project.
[170.00 --> 172.00]  Maybe even council wants to do a project.
[172.00 --> 176.00]  Or you want to involve your extended family in a project.
[176.00 --> 182.00]  Just get creative and see where the joy of giving leads you.
[182.00 --> 189.00]  Also, what we're going to do later in the season, when we put our tree out in the foyer,
[189.00 --> 194.00]  we'll provide some little decorations that you can write the name of your gift on,
[194.00 --> 200.00]  so we can just see what has come from this church to World Renew as Christmas gifts.
[200.00 --> 203.00]  It's always kind of fun to do that and decorate a tree.
[203.00 --> 211.00]  And just look carefully in here, and you will see a story about John and Kathy Vandervelde.
[211.00 --> 215.00]  So if you haven't already seen that, I urge you to do that.
[215.00 --> 220.00]  Thank you in advance for your love and compassion in that regard.
[220.00 --> 229.00]  The last announcement I have is a bit of a report that I am expected to give you as a congregation.
[229.00 --> 237.00]  In September, I attended Gather, a two-day conference in Calgary from the Christian Reformed Church denomination.
[237.00 --> 248.00]  Attendees were from both sides of the border, including members of the Korean American Church from California and Arizona, complete with translator.
[248.00 --> 254.00]  It was wonderful to have a very diverse group of people, and I made a few good friends there as well.
[254.00 --> 261.00]  Sessions focused on participant discussion rather than speakers.
[261.00 --> 263.00]  We did have facilitators.
[263.00 --> 271.00]  Our time together included worship, scripture study, and roundtable discussions within a signed diverse group.
[271.00 --> 277.00]  We studied the passage of Luke 24, the road to Emmaus.
[277.00 --> 285.00]  Disciples of Jesus walking with him, believing him to be a stranger.
[285.00 --> 294.00]  How, in telling Jesus of his own death, said, and said, we had hoped he was the Messiah.
[294.00 --> 301.00]  Even his own followers failed to identify him in their midst or recognize him as the Messiah.
[301.00 --> 305.00]  Then comes the breaking of the bread together in Emmaus.
[305.00 --> 312.00]  Their eyes are opened to his identity, and later, they are given power to share the message of joy in Jerusalem.
[312.00 --> 320.00]  We looked at all of this through the lens of our denomination, our home churches, and even our personal lives.
[320.00 --> 325.00]  It is an amazing passage packed with insight and encouragement.
[325.00 --> 332.00]  I will be sharing more at the council meeting on Wednesday, as is expected of every delegate who attended.
[332.00 --> 338.00]  If you have any questions about the conference, I'd be happy to share with you later over coffee.
[338.00 --> 339.00]  Thank you.
[339.00 --> 354.00]  Today is Reformation Sunday.
[354.00 --> 355.00]  Reformation Sunday.
[355.00 --> 360.00]  In our congregation, it's always the Sunday before the actual day of Reformation.
[360.00 --> 364.00]  For that reason, we'll be singing the traditional Luther hymn,
[364.00 --> 367.00]  A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.
[367.00 --> 378.00]  And before that happens, Paul Kemp will say some words about why it's important to our denomination and our church to recognize Reformation Sunday.
[378.00 --> 382.00]  Why are you here today?
[382.00 --> 385.00]  Why are you here today?
[385.00 --> 388.00]  What are you doing here?
[388.00 --> 391.00]  Is it out of custom?
[391.00 --> 393.00]  A habit?
[393.00 --> 395.00]  To see friends?
[395.00 --> 397.00]  Hmm.
[397.00 --> 399.00]  Almost like being in a club?
[399.00 --> 402.00]  Hmm.
[402.00 --> 409.00]  If you're a visitor, maybe you're just curious about what we do here and how we do it.
[409.00 --> 412.00]  These aren't bad things, actually.
[412.00 --> 417.00]  I mean, many of those options are why I'm here.
[417.00 --> 427.00]  But we are really here to honor God, praise Him, thank Him, learn from His Word,
[427.00 --> 432.00]  and He encourages us to do that habitually.
[432.00 --> 442.00]  In that context, our call to worship this morning is a litany based on Psalm 27 and John 4, verse 23.
[442.00 --> 446.00]  As usual, when you see the double dots, it's your turn.
[446.00 --> 451.00]  Let us worship God, our light, and our salvation.
[451.00 --> 455.00]  The Lord is stronghold of us.
[455.00 --> 460.00]  We desire to live in God's house and to seek God in His holy temple.
[460.00 --> 467.00]  We have come with shouts of joy to sing and make music to the Lord.
[467.00 --> 472.00]  Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[472.00 --> 482.00]  Teach us your ways and make straight our paths in this hour of worship and always.
[482.00 --> 487.00]  Will you join me in a prayer of adoration as we begin this service?
[487.00 --> 491.00]  Eternal God, we come before you with words of praise.
[491.00 --> 495.00]  We seek to worship you and draw closer to you.
[495.00 --> 497.00]  You are worthy of praise.
[497.00 --> 502.00]  You created the heavens and the earth and all that are contained within.
[502.00 --> 505.00]  Thank you for your mighty acts in creation.
[505.00 --> 520.00]  We give you thanks for your son, Jesus Christ, for His ministry of teaching and healing, for showing us the way to a better life, for providing us with a connection to you, and for the sure promise of eternal life.
[520.00 --> 529.00]  O God, you are so gracious in your great mercy, you provide us with all that we need.
[529.00 --> 532.00]  We take joy in the abundance of your bounty.
[532.00 --> 545.00]  We pray that we will always follow your ways, that your presence will shelter us, for you are our rock and our redeemer, a hiding place and a strong tower.
[545.00 --> 548.00]  Thank you, O God, for loving us.
[548.00 --> 551.00]  We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[551.00 --> 561.00]  The Lord's greeting to you is almost a command this morning, and it comes from Psalm 46, verses 10 and 11.
[561.00 --> 564.00]  Be silent and know that I am God.
[564.00 --> 567.00]  I will be honored by every nation.
[567.00 --> 570.00]  I will be honored throughout the world.
[570.00 --> 573.00]  The Lord Almighty is here among us.
[573.00 --> 576.00]  The God of Israel is our fortress.
[576.00 --> 586.00]  With that, would you please stand, turn around and greet that person behind you, before we sing our first songs of praise.

[760.00 --> 770.00]  Oh, Lord, our helping ages past, our hope for years to come,
[770.00 --> 781.00]  We now are God, our God, our life shall rise, and our eternal life.
[781.00 --> 793.00]  You are, You are, You are our God, You are our God, You are,
[793.00 --> 806.00]  And Your mission will be forever and ever, O shield, and our eternal hope.
[806.00 --> 818.00]  Oh, Lord, You are the ancient ways, and worthy of our faith.
[818.00 --> 828.00]  Oh, God, You are, You are our help, You are our helper to all,
[828.00 --> 841.00]  And Your mission will be forever and ever, O shield, and our eternal hope.
[841.00 --> 853.00]  Oh, Lord, You are the ancient ways, and worthy of our faith.
[853.00 --> 862.00]  You are the ancient ways, and worthy of our faith.
[862.00 --> 881.00]  Oh, Lord, You are the ancient ways, and worthy of our faith.
[881.00 --> 894.88]  Oh, Lord, you are the instant of grace and worthy of grace.
[897.02 --> 903.50]  You are the instant of grace and worthy of grace.
[903.50 --> 913.50]  You are the instant of grace and worthy of grace.
[916.78 --> 917.38]  Amen.
[920.24 --> 925.18]  Next, we're going to sing, Almighty Forkish is Our God, written by Martin Luther.
[925.94 --> 932.40]  And I just wanted to share a few thoughts about the legacy or the meaning and the impact of the Reformation.
[933.26 --> 942.34]  Martin Luther's Reformation, which began in the 16th century, had a profound impact on the course of history and continues to shape the lives of Protestant Christians today.
[943.38 --> 954.44]  Luther's bold standing against the corrupt practices of the Catholic Church sparked a movement that emphasized the authority of Scripture, salvation of faith alone, and the priesthood of all believers.
[954.44 --> 963.72]  These key principles laid the foundation of the Protestant faith and brought about significant changes in religious, social, and political landscapes.
[964.68 --> 974.08]  Luther's emphasis on individual interpretation of the Bible has empowered believers to engage in the Scripture directly and to seek a personal relationship with God.
[974.08 --> 985.76]  This legacy of personal responsibility and spiritual autonomy continues to influence how many Protestants approach their faith and live out their beliefs in the modern world.
[985.76 --> 993.14]  Further more, the Reformation's impact on education, the arts, and the concept of democracy cannot be understated.
[993.92 --> 1003.26]  Luther's emphasis on education for all, his advocacy for the use of the vernacular of worship, and his belief in the value of every individual before God,
[1003.80 --> 1008.90]  helped pave the way for advancements in literacy, music, and new rights.
[1008.90 --> 1022.02]  In today's world, the Reformation's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for truth, pursuing justice, and seeking a deeper understanding of faith in our personal and communal lives.
[1023.06 --> 1025.82]  We'll sing this song. I'm going to slip over to the organ.
[1025.96 --> 1033.72]  It's such a wonderful thing in this church to have an actual pipe organ to use, which to me is the best setting for many porpoises.
[1033.72 --> 1041.28]  So, just think thoughts about what I've just said as I wander over and be saying something.
[1041.28 --> 1041.42]  Thank you.
[1041.42 --> 1041.46]  Thank you.
[1041.46 --> 1041.52]  Thank you.
[1063.72 --> 1076.42]  Thank you.
[1076.42 --> 1080.64]  Thank you.
[1089.04 --> 1089.36]  Thank you.

[1124.28 --> 1132.28]  all your praise, not his name and mine.
[1132.28 --> 1138.28]  With me in our own strength of life,
[1138.28 --> 1146.28]  our star in good, in good, in good, in good, in good.
[1146.28 --> 1152.28]  Word of God, our great hope of star,
[1152.28 --> 1159.28]  the land of God's Lord to stay.
[1159.28 --> 1164.28]  You must, who that may be,
[1164.28 --> 1169.28]  Christ Jesus made his name,
[1169.28 --> 1174.28]  Lord, set the love of his name,
[1174.28 --> 1180.28]  from age to age to sin,
[1180.28 --> 1188.28]  that he must win the battle.
[1188.28 --> 1196.28]  And though this world in devils' field,
[1196.28 --> 1202.28]  should grant them to undo us,
[1202.28 --> 1208.28]  they will not be for God as well,
[1208.28 --> 1215.28]  his truth to triumph to us.
[1215.28 --> 1221.28]  The prince of darkness bring,
[1221.28 --> 1226.28]  each other of God for him.
[1226.28 --> 1232.28]  His ways we can endure,
[1232.28 --> 1237.28]  although it's truly true,
[1237.28 --> 1247.28]  a little word shall fail me.
[1247.28 --> 1254.28]  Let me know my brother in the heart,
[1254.28 --> 1262.28]  who prays to me for my life.
[1262.28 --> 1272.28]  The state of the Lamb is glad,

[1305.30 --> 1309.06]  We ve ve y성을
[1309.06 --> 1333.86]  Our scripture reading this morning comes from Deuteronomy 30.
[1333.86 --> 1339.56]  This is on the occasion just before the Israelites are entering the promised land.
[1339.80 --> 1342.32]  I'm going to read verses 11 to 20.
[1344.42 --> 1350.40]  Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
[1351.16 --> 1353.60]  It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask,
[1354.14 --> 1358.56]  Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so that we may obey it?
[1358.56 --> 1362.14]  Nor is it beyond the sea so you have to ask,
[1362.62 --> 1367.14]  Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?
[1367.86 --> 1369.76]  No, the word is very near you.
[1370.18 --> 1373.90]  It is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
[1374.88 --> 1380.84]  See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.
[1380.84 --> 1386.26]  For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him,
[1386.62 --> 1389.78]  and to keep his commands, decrees, and laws.
[1390.12 --> 1391.84]  Then you will live and increase,
[1392.24 --> 1395.82]  and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
[1397.72 --> 1401.54]  But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient,
[1402.04 --> 1406.36]  and you and few are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
[1406.36 --> 1410.62]  I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed.
[1411.26 --> 1415.28]  You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
[1416.52 --> 1421.34]  This day I call heavens and earth as witnesses against you
[1421.34 --> 1426.20]  that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses.
[1427.24 --> 1430.66]  Now choose life that you and your children may live,
[1431.10 --> 1433.02]  and that you may love the Lord your God,
[1433.18 --> 1435.72]  listen to his voice, and hold fast to him.
[1435.72 --> 1439.34]  For the Lord is your life, and he will give you many years
[1439.34 --> 1445.20]  in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1446.66 --> 1447.94]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1454.04 --> 1457.58]  For our time of confession, contemplation, and assurance,
[1457.58 --> 1465.22]  in the numerous times that Elaine and I have traveled in Europe,
[1466.06 --> 1473.20]  we have seen perhaps somewhere between 150 and 200 Catholic churches easily.
[1474.20 --> 1477.26]  Saw a bunch this last trip, maybe a couple more than we needed to.
[1477.26 --> 1485.08]  But I've often wondered what happens in those elaborate wood confession booths.
[1486.14 --> 1489.74]  What level of detail do the priests have to listen to?
[1491.62 --> 1494.16]  I have no plans of becoming a Catholic,
[1494.66 --> 1498.48]  and we must always remember that we can confess to God directly.
[1498.48 --> 1501.14]  But it gets you thinking,
[1501.52 --> 1504.66]  what if I were in the booth making a confession?
[1507.16 --> 1507.46]  Hmm.
[1509.10 --> 1510.86]  I was pretty good last week.
[1512.12 --> 1513.52]  I don't hate anybody.
[1514.50 --> 1515.80]  I certainly didn't kill anyone.
[1517.00 --> 1519.02]  Well, there are a few I don't like very much.
[1519.02 --> 1523.96]  I was a bit short with my wife Elaine a time or two,
[1524.14 --> 1527.26]  but I later apologized a little.
[1528.34 --> 1529.58]  And doesn't everyone do that?
[1531.76 --> 1534.28]  When I got cut off in traffic, I was pretty upset,
[1534.62 --> 1535.82]  but later I was okay.
[1536.52 --> 1538.26]  That's sort of like being forgiving.
[1540.84 --> 1542.66]  I feel bad for those out of work
[1542.66 --> 1545.50]  or otherwise struggling financially.
[1546.34 --> 1547.42]  I'm doing okay,
[1547.42 --> 1549.70]  and I help them a bit in some ways,
[1550.66 --> 1551.22]  sometimes.
[1552.50 --> 1553.24]  But you know,
[1554.20 --> 1556.12]  the many years of my hard work
[1556.12 --> 1558.50]  and my good financial planning
[1558.50 --> 1560.48]  are the main reason I'm doing okay.
[1562.48 --> 1564.24]  I hope you're seeing a pattern here.
[1565.36 --> 1566.52]  The Apostle Paul would have,
[1567.12 --> 1569.00]  and I hope I'm exaggerating a little.
[1572.54 --> 1576.52]  But despite the above worrisome behavior on my part,
[1576.52 --> 1577.72]  perhaps yours,
[1577.92 --> 1579.98]  we still have assurance of our forgiveness.
[1581.30 --> 1583.62]  I read words from Paul's letter to the Romans
[1583.62 --> 1584.52]  in chapter 3.
[1584.86 --> 1586.72]  Indeed, the early chapters of Romans
[1586.72 --> 1588.72]  were key in leading Martin Luther
[1588.72 --> 1590.86]  to the conviction that we heard about earlier
[1590.86 --> 1592.90]  that a reformation was needed.
[1592.90 --> 1595.26]  I'm reading from Romans 3,
[1596.14 --> 1598.60]  verses 20 and forward.
[1600.60 --> 1603.60]  No one will be declared righteous in God's sight
[1603.60 --> 1605.38]  by the works of the law.
[1605.78 --> 1606.80]  Rather, through the law,
[1606.88 --> 1608.28]  we become conscious of our sin.
[1608.88 --> 1610.58]  But now, apart from the law,
[1610.92 --> 1613.70]  the righteousness of God has been made known.
[1613.86 --> 1615.52]  This righteousness of God
[1615.52 --> 1617.78]  is given through faith in Jesus Christ
[1617.78 --> 1618.86]  to all who believe.
[1618.86 --> 1621.76]  There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
[1622.32 --> 1623.90]  for all have sinned
[1623.90 --> 1626.26]  and fall short of the glory of God,
[1626.52 --> 1629.62]  and all are justified freely by his grace
[1629.62 --> 1632.38]  through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
[1633.10 --> 1636.06]  God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement
[1636.06 --> 1637.86]  through the shedding of his blood
[1637.86 --> 1639.76]  to be received by faith.
[1640.14 --> 1642.02]  He did this to demonstrate his righteousness
[1642.02 --> 1643.70]  because of his forbearance.
[1643.70 --> 1645.92]  This English dictionary says,
[1646.36 --> 1648.36]  forbearance is patient, self-control,
[1648.58 --> 1649.90]  restraint, and tolerance.
[1650.36 --> 1651.62]  Because of his forbearance,
[1652.30 --> 1655.66]  he left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[1656.80 --> 1658.66]  He did it to demonstrate his righteousness
[1658.66 --> 1660.04]  at the present time
[1660.04 --> 1661.94]  so as to be just
[1661.94 --> 1663.92]  and the one who justifies those
[1663.92 --> 1665.66]  who have faith in Jesus.
[1667.36 --> 1669.30]  This is God's plan for me,
[1669.30 --> 1672.82]  me who often sees my own actions
[1672.82 --> 1674.42]  through rose-colored glasses.
[1675.54 --> 1676.52]  Thanks be to God.
[1677.66 --> 1679.62]  We'll sing a couple of songs in response
[1679.62 --> 1680.66]  that focus on this.
[1680.84 --> 1682.78]  First is Good Shepherd of My Soul.
[1696.78 --> 1697.62]  Let's dance.
[1699.30 --> 1729.28]  Good Shepherd of My Soul
[1729.30 --> 1759.28]  Good Shepherd of My Soul
[1759.28 --> 1761.28]  And His love
[1761.28 --> 1763.28]  And His love into the darkness
[1763.90 --> 1767.70]  Of the powers of hell
[1767.70 --> 1769.74]  Raise and mercy
[1769.74 --> 1771.66]  For profounding
[1771.66 --> 1774.86]  To the proudly army
[1774.86 --> 1779.54]  It is done, it is finished
[1779.54 --> 1782.92]  From every sin set free
[1782.92 --> 1786.28]  All the victory of Christ
[1786.28 --> 1786.90]  For the hören and the� anges
[1786.90 --> 1791.90]  Or the favor and the li Originogen
[1795.94 --> 1798.30]  Who was filled with is the great
[1798.30 --> 1804.12]  In the stillness, how I heard your voice.
[1804.56 --> 1808.02]  Every whisper, every promise,
[1808.40 --> 1811.72]  Fought my heart to rejoice.
[1812.12 --> 1815.52]  In the plight of the morning,
[1815.94 --> 1819.26]  In the watches of the night,
[1819.66 --> 1823.32]  In the fire of my struggles,
[1823.32 --> 1826.82]  My spirit will be a fire.
[1826.82 --> 1830.54]  For the power of Christ,
[1831.06 --> 1835.44]  For the power of life.
[1840.32 --> 1843.82]  I so long to walk closer,
[1844.30 --> 1847.50]  In the Lord I serve.
[1847.50 --> 1851.40]  For the winter's full of favor,
[1851.80 --> 1855.28]  I delight in your word.
[1855.28 --> 1859.00]  Turn thy ways from all that's worthless,
[1859.00 --> 1862.90]  Set my heart on things above,
[1862.90 --> 1866.90]  Make thy light ever goodness,
[1866.90 --> 1870.52]  Your way of truth, power, and law.
[1870.52 --> 1874.24]  All the wisdom of Christ,
[1874.24 --> 1877.96]  For the power of life.
[1877.96 --> 1887.58]  I so long to walk closer,
[1887.58 --> 1891.16]  I will see your face,
[1891.16 --> 1895.06]  You shall touch in relation,
[1895.06 --> 1898.64]  Now what is death or pain?
[1898.64 --> 1902.36]  Every word, my soul, come,
[1902.36 --> 1906.26]  Heaven seems an earthly part,
[1906.26 --> 1910.04]  To our glory, the glory,
[1910.04 --> 1913.74]  The all creation of God,
[1913.74 --> 1917.36]  Praise and honor to Christ,
[1917.36 --> 1920.26]  Word of God, word of God.
[1920.26 --> 1921.76]  Amen.
[1921.76 --> 1922.06]  Amen.
[1922.06 --> 1922.14]  Amen.
[1932.78 --> 1936.02]  Amen.
[1936.02 --> 1936.36]  Amen.
[1936.74 --> 1936.92]  Amen.
[1936.98 --> 1937.90]  Amen.
[1938.14 --> 1940.56]  Amen.
[1942.00 --> 1942.40]  Amen.
[1942.40 --> 1958.40]  The shepherd of my soul,
[1958.40 --> 1961.40]  and crown within me,
[1961.40 --> 1965.40]  before I am and all,
[1965.40 --> 1968.40]  your life lives in me.
[1968.40 --> 1972.40]  Before the cross of Christ,
[1972.40 --> 1976.40]  this is my sacred cross,
[1976.40 --> 1978.40]  the life made down,
[1978.40 --> 1981.40]  we're ready to come.
[1981.40 --> 1991.40]  The cork of Romans 8 Wowos
[1991.40 --> 1999.06]  The town of time and peace
[1999.06 --> 2001.42]  He is to surrender
[2001.42 --> 2006.20]  The priests that they're released
[2006.20 --> 2008.74]  From chains of anger
[2008.74 --> 2012.74]  It's great, the living race
[2013.58 --> 2017.04]  I find our rest in peace
[2017.04 --> 2020.74]  To rise with rest, to turn into love
[2021.40 --> 2038.96]  Now walk this narrow road
[2038.96 --> 2042.60]  With Christ's peace for me
[2042.60 --> 2046.46]  On roads and hills of strife
[2046.46 --> 2048.82]  And roads and stary
[2048.82 --> 2053.58]  On our early life
[2053.58 --> 2057.04]  The heaven is my star
[2057.04 --> 2059.40]  But it's my heaven
[2059.40 --> 2061.34]  Cause it's dark
[2061.34 --> 2078.90]  And when my days are gone
[2078.90 --> 2081.66]  My strength is giving
[2081.66 --> 2086.42]  You bring me along
[2086.42 --> 2088.88]  To death's own committee
[2088.88 --> 2092.88]  Your struggles overcome
[2092.88 --> 2096.42]  Those are angels' people
[2096.42 --> 2099.22]  To search Christ's depths
[2099.22 --> 2103.98]  And ever to follow
[2103.98 --> 2107.98]  And ever to follow
[2107.98 --> 2120.36]  You bring me along
[2120.36 --> 2144.60]  So before we send the kids off for their classes, you know, we're going to be collecting boxes
[2144.60 --> 2151.44]  for Operation Christmas Child, and Jackie volunteered to give some explanation about that.
[2151.54 --> 2155.26]  So what we're going to do is first, there's going to watch a short video clip that kind
[2155.26 --> 2160.84]  of shows how, you know, some people are engaging in this, and then I want to invite, when the
[2160.84 --> 2163.72]  video's over, I want all the kids to come up front, okay?
[2163.92 --> 2168.50]  So get ready, you'll come up front, and then Jackie will talk to you about the Christmas
[2168.50 --> 2170.84]  boxes, and then from there, you can go to your classes.
[2171.02 --> 2172.24]  So let's watch the video first.
[2174.60 --> 2176.02]  Hola, I am Margarita.
[2176.54 --> 2177.50]  Hi, I'm Barbara.
[2178.24 --> 2182.10]  And together, we are the Happy Grandmas.
[2184.00 --> 2185.74]  How did you guys meet?
[2187.04 --> 2188.78]  Okay, that was a long time ago.
[2190.06 --> 2197.32]  We were in a Sunday school class together, and I remember Margarita, and I remember her
[2197.32 --> 2203.76]  asking a lot of questions, and I'm very shy, so I wasn't asking any questions.
[2204.60 --> 2206.86]  We're more than friends.
[2206.86 --> 2208.24]  We're sisters, you know.
[2208.50 --> 2209.20]  Oh, yes.
[2209.30 --> 2209.92]  How are you?
[2210.74 --> 2212.58]  And we have traveled together.
[2212.96 --> 2214.36]  Oh, yes, so much fun traveling.
[2214.66 --> 2216.20]  She is a comedian.
[2216.20 --> 2220.28]  I mean, this, I think this is the last season of our lives, I guess.
[2220.70 --> 2224.80]  Or maybe the second to last, maybe.
[2226.80 --> 2230.04]  We've been making these cutlies, these stuffed animals.
[2231.78 --> 2235.46]  They have been going to different missions with our churches.
[2235.46 --> 2242.60]  We were praying, Lord, give us a ministry that we can just provide continually.
[2242.60 --> 2248.26]  We knew about Operation Christmas Child through our churches.
[2249.46 --> 2253.72]  And we said, maybe these little guys can go in there.
[2254.18 --> 2261.64]  We can come up together with a script to put on a little label on the plastic bag that we
[2261.64 --> 2268.30]  put them in to tell a child, you know, God loves them just like they are, and that they're
[2268.30 --> 2272.34]  perfectly imperfect, just like all of us are.
[2274.56 --> 2276.74]  It's showing God's love for them.
[2276.98 --> 2277.74]  It's like a comfort.
[2277.90 --> 2285.86]  The name, Comfort Cuddly, we always wanted that word comfort to be present when whoever
[2285.86 --> 2288.70]  receives them gets the comfort from God.
[2290.36 --> 2292.82]  And it's a cuddly because we can cuddle to it.
[2293.74 --> 2300.44]  They may use up their soap, and there are different things, but if they can keep this
[2300.44 --> 2305.42]  to hold, it'll make them think of God loving them and holding them.
[2306.10 --> 2307.74]  See, he has his own personality.
[2309.02 --> 2314.08]  We've made just over 5,000 cuddlies since 2017.
[2314.08 --> 2318.98]  It's contagious, you know, people we talk all the time.
[2319.24 --> 2320.10]  Oh, I want to help.
[2320.22 --> 2324.68]  I said, oh yeah, you can donate even, you know, your clothes, you know, you can donate.
[2325.16 --> 2327.14]  That's a nice top, Barbara.
[2327.28 --> 2328.12]  We can use that for sure.
[2328.12 --> 2329.46]  You're not going to cut my shirt.
[2331.62 --> 2337.68]  If I can see, and if I can sew, and if I can cut and trace, I'll be doing this until
[2337.68 --> 2338.12]  I die.
[2338.84 --> 2343.58]  I tell my kids, I'm staying to 100, and they're like, why would you want to do that?
[2344.08 --> 2345.80]  And I said, I have cuddlies to make.
[2345.88 --> 2347.50]  I have things to do.
[2347.98 --> 2351.36]  And as long as God keeps me healthy, we will continue.
[2352.74 --> 2353.76]  We make them.
[2354.36 --> 2355.50]  God place them.
[2355.50 --> 2370.82]  Good morning and thank you.
[2371.24 --> 2375.44]  I'd like all the boys and girls, I hope there's lots to come on down.
[2375.54 --> 2376.56]  I need some helpers.
[2377.02 --> 2379.30]  And we're going to talk about the Operation Shoebox.
[2379.30 --> 2382.58]  While they're coming down, I hope there's lots.
[2383.88 --> 2386.02]  I'll just give you a few basic information.
[2386.34 --> 2391.46]  Last year alone, there was almost 11 million shoeboxes sent to 100 countries worldwide.
[2391.72 --> 2392.62]  Come on up, kids.
[2392.98 --> 2394.26]  Have a seat here for a minute.
[2396.14 --> 2397.06]  Find a spot.
[2397.16 --> 2397.80]  Thank you.
[2397.94 --> 2398.54]  Come on down.
[2398.64 --> 2399.92]  Oh, I'm glad there's some older ones.
[2400.00 --> 2400.84]  I need more helpers.
[2400.84 --> 2407.56]  And in Canada alone, there was over 415,000 boxes sent.
[2407.92 --> 2412.52]  So I think that's pretty amazing, and I'm glad we are part of this program.
[2412.64 --> 2414.40]  This is one of my favorite things to do.
[2414.66 --> 2417.64]  If you talk to my husband, I have boxes hidden all around my house.
[2417.64 --> 2421.18]  I've lost my voice here.
[2421.64 --> 2422.52]  Is it back on?
[2423.70 --> 2424.38]  Thank you.
[2424.78 --> 2425.18]  Okay.
[2425.76 --> 2430.56]  This morning, I don't want to take too long, because I know these kids are eager to go,
[2431.10 --> 2433.36]  but take a box.
[2433.70 --> 2439.98]  You can take one of those kind of boxes over there, or if you're like me and you want to
[2439.98 --> 2444.26]  put a few more things in, you can use one of these, or even just a regular shoebox.
[2444.42 --> 2445.60]  They do not mind.
[2445.60 --> 2451.08]  So when you're going to do your box, the first thing you need to do is decide, well,
[2451.30 --> 2453.26]  pick a box, and then what are you going to do?
[2453.34 --> 2455.16]  Do you want to do a girl or a boy?
[2455.54 --> 2458.66]  And what's really important is take the piece of paper.
[2458.84 --> 2460.90]  There's a little strip on there.
[2461.00 --> 2462.18]  It's either green or red.
[2462.34 --> 2463.94]  Choose which one you want.
[2464.34 --> 2467.06]  Cut it off and tape it to the top of the box.
[2467.40 --> 2472.92]  And then remember to tick off whether it's going to be for a young child, 2 to 4, 5 to 9,
[2473.00 --> 2474.42]  or the older kids.
[2474.42 --> 2477.76]  It makes it easier if you remember just to check it off.
[2478.18 --> 2481.96]  Then, once you've got to that, you have to decide, well, now what are you going to put
[2481.96 --> 2482.32]  in it?
[2482.56 --> 2485.32]  How many of you were watching those happy grandmas, right?
[2485.72 --> 2491.70]  Now, they were not doing a whole box every time, but instead they chose to make some pretty
[2491.70 --> 2493.48]  fun little dolls or animals.
[2493.48 --> 2499.30]  And I know in this congregation, you may not know that, but there are some very, very talented
[2499.30 --> 2502.18]  people here and also very generous.
[2502.64 --> 2507.98]  There is already one lady who helps with a friend of mine, and they make hundreds of feminine
[2507.98 --> 2510.96]  products that go in the boxes every single year.
[2510.96 --> 2514.44]  So, thank you to that lady, and she knows who she is.
[2514.44 --> 2517.24]  But, we can do other things.
[2517.44 --> 2522.10]  If some of you want to learn and form a group to knit or crochet, there's a lot of handmade
[2522.10 --> 2524.38]  products that they like getting.
[2525.10 --> 2526.00]  Toys as well.
[2526.20 --> 2529.44]  Or, even little wooden cars and things can be made.
[2529.78 --> 2531.52]  And you don't have to just fill a box.
[2531.90 --> 2536.48]  We can send them separately because sometimes the boxes aren't quite full, and then in Calgary
[2536.48 --> 2537.62]  they will fill them up.
[2538.10 --> 2545.02]  Now, what I want you to do is, I want you all to grab one of those boxes, open it up.
[2545.20 --> 2546.84]  Inside you will find a paper.
[2547.20 --> 2548.54]  Leave the paper in the box.
[2548.64 --> 2549.76]  I hope there's enough.
[2550.34 --> 2552.26]  And then come back to your spot here.
[2553.60 --> 2555.38]  Maybe the older kids can wait.
[2556.04 --> 2556.48]  Okay.
[2556.72 --> 2558.28]  You've each got a box.
[2558.86 --> 2559.12]  Yeah.
[2559.42 --> 2564.74]  Now, I want you to open the box, and there's one or two items in there.
[2564.74 --> 2566.60]  Leave the paper, it can stay in the box.
[2567.02 --> 2567.80]  Oh, pretty good.
[2567.90 --> 2569.34]  We even have just a couple left.
[2569.76 --> 2570.12]  Okay.
[2570.36 --> 2575.50]  Now, I'm going to go around, and I want you to hold the one or two items up really high,
[2575.64 --> 2579.82]  so that way you guys got some ideas of what you can fill it up with.
[2580.06 --> 2582.84]  And you can say it, or I will say it if you're a little shy.
[2582.98 --> 2583.96]  Annika, you want to start?
[2584.24 --> 2585.20]  What do you have in your box?
[2585.28 --> 2586.40]  You hold them up real high.
[2586.78 --> 2587.38]  And the other one.
[2588.02 --> 2588.56]  This one too?
[2589.18 --> 2590.30]  Not the paper, not the paper.
[2590.52 --> 2590.96]  These two.
[2591.02 --> 2591.74]  What do you have, Annika?
[2591.74 --> 2594.92]  A towel and soap.
[2595.42 --> 2596.32]  Towels and soap.
[2596.56 --> 2597.16]  What do you have?
[2597.52 --> 2598.12]  Real high?
[2598.44 --> 2599.24]  Hold it up high?
[2599.92 --> 2600.50]  Do you know what you did?
[2601.22 --> 2605.14]  A teddy bear and or bracelets can go in.
[2605.26 --> 2605.68]  What do you have?
[2605.78 --> 2606.84]  Hold your items.
[2607.56 --> 2608.06]  What do you have?
[2609.42 --> 2610.30]  You hold them up.
[2610.46 --> 2611.20]  Hold them up high.
[2612.32 --> 2616.84]  We have a little wooden car that was handmade and spinning tops.
[2617.24 --> 2618.50]  What do you have in your box?
[2618.50 --> 2622.76]  I have a skinny ball and a tennis ball.
[2623.12 --> 2626.72]  Or any type of ball is great too, including the big soccer balls.
[2627.14 --> 2629.30]  We can deflate and include them.
[2629.46 --> 2630.44]  What do you have in yours?
[2630.56 --> 2631.42]  Do you know what it is?
[2631.80 --> 2633.14]  You have lots of goodies.
[2633.98 --> 2634.58]  What do you have?
[2635.72 --> 2636.72]  Coloring book.
[2637.64 --> 2638.36]  You want to help her?
[2638.54 --> 2639.32]  What else does she have?
[2639.32 --> 2641.00]  A sticker book.
[2641.38 --> 2641.94]  And?
[2642.28 --> 2642.64]  Scissors.
[2643.40 --> 2643.92]  Scissors.
[2643.92 --> 2645.42]  There's a lot of school supplies.
[2645.56 --> 2646.52]  They're much appreciated.
[2646.64 --> 2647.26]  What do you have?
[2649.30 --> 2650.14]  Do you know what they are?
[2650.96 --> 2655.60]  We have a homemade headband and toques.
[2655.70 --> 2661.74]  I never thought it got cold, but after just receiving a new grandson from an African country,
[2661.82 --> 2663.38]  I decided they do have snow.
[2663.46 --> 2664.60]  It can get cold too.
[2664.60 --> 2665.36]  So toques are.
[2665.72 --> 2666.34]  What do you have?
[2666.40 --> 2667.26]  Do you know what they're called?
[2669.56 --> 2670.04]  Marbles.
[2670.04 --> 2670.40]  Marbles.
[2670.54 --> 2672.20]  And you want to hold the other one up too?
[2672.78 --> 2674.30]  Lots of games are appreciated.
[2675.54 --> 2677.22]  And dominoes as well.
[2678.10 --> 2680.26]  And here, you want to hold it up really high?
[2680.72 --> 2681.94]  It's another game.
[2682.08 --> 2682.52]  Thank you.
[2682.62 --> 2683.54]  What's in your box?
[2686.50 --> 2687.80]  You are correct.
[2687.90 --> 2688.74]  Want to see real loud?
[2689.30 --> 2690.10]  Sewing supplies?
[2690.26 --> 2690.66]  Yes.
[2690.76 --> 2694.28]  The older girls appreciate sewing supplies or jewelry.
[2694.46 --> 2694.80]  Thank you.
[2694.86 --> 2695.54]  What else do we have?
[2695.62 --> 2696.78]  Oh, we got a few more in the back.
[2698.78 --> 2699.90]  Play-doh.
[2700.04 --> 2703.88]  Play-doh and cookie cutters, especially for the younger children are appreciated.
[2704.12 --> 2704.72]  What's in yours?
[2705.32 --> 2706.78]  I got a hairbrush.
[2707.36 --> 2708.66]  I got a hairbrush.
[2708.92 --> 2711.74]  Yes, hairbrush, hair accessories, combs are good.
[2713.04 --> 2714.04]  You know what they are?
[2714.28 --> 2716.88]  We've got pencils, pencil crayons.
[2717.24 --> 2721.90]  Don't forget to include a sharpener.
[2722.08 --> 2724.56]  Otherwise, the pencils become useless after a while.
[2724.76 --> 2725.76]  And do you know what you have?
[2726.98 --> 2729.00]  We have some socks and a bag.
[2729.00 --> 2731.08]  Now, the boxes aren't going to last forever.
[2731.26 --> 2736.90]  So, if you make a cloth bag, then they can always put their gifts in as well.
[2737.16 --> 2739.40]  And we have two more left.
[2739.88 --> 2741.34]  What is in this one?
[2742.38 --> 2744.50]  And what's inside the water bottle?
[2746.08 --> 2747.60]  Yes, toothbrushes.
[2747.60 --> 2750.76]  Do you know I got over 200 toothbrushes for my birthday?
[2750.94 --> 2751.92]  That was a unique gift.
[2752.32 --> 2753.04]  Long story.
[2753.18 --> 2754.38]  Come ask me about that one.
[2754.56 --> 2755.80]  For the shoe boxes.
[2756.02 --> 2757.58]  And one more box.
[2757.70 --> 2758.88]  What's in that last one?
[2759.00 --> 2759.74]  No, there's a lot more.
[2759.86 --> 2761.50]  Oh, a little teddy bear.
[2761.62 --> 2762.98]  Again, this was handmade.
[2763.22 --> 2767.22]  A few twists and you've got a real cute little teddy bear that becomes a washcloth.
[2767.22 --> 2769.06]  And the last one?
[2770.00 --> 2770.86]  What's this one?
[2771.16 --> 2771.60]  A doll.
[2771.60 --> 2773.30]  A doll and?
[2775.48 --> 2776.66]  Do you know what this is?
[2777.40 --> 2777.70]  A puppet.
[2778.04 --> 2778.88]  A puppet.
[2778.88 --> 2780.92]  Again, lots of handmade things.
[2781.42 --> 2782.78]  You want to try them out?
[2783.22 --> 2783.66]  Okay.
[2783.98 --> 2785.36]  Thank you, boys and girls.
[2785.80 --> 2790.04]  Now, as you can see, there is so many different things to do.
[2790.04 --> 2793.96]  I would like you to take the items out of the box.
[2796.40 --> 2799.34]  Instead, put them in my great big box.
[2800.00 --> 2802.26]  Except for the paper, you can keep that one.
[2802.70 --> 2807.66]  Don't forget, you can include postcards of the area we live in or pictures, kids.
[2807.96 --> 2812.52]  You know what you can do is make a pretty picture of yourself, a card.
[2813.04 --> 2813.96]  Write a little note.
[2814.08 --> 2815.28]  They appreciate that.
[2815.28 --> 2820.76]  And then most of all, once you pack it, wrap it with an elastic band.
[2820.86 --> 2824.60]  Do not put tape around it because they will get inspected in Calgary.
[2824.78 --> 2830.60]  Every box gets opened, checked by over hundreds of volunteers before they travel.
[2830.72 --> 2831.60]  Do you know how they go?
[2832.12 --> 2833.52]  Some on planes, some on boat.
[2833.62 --> 2838.36]  But I found out they even go by elephants and camels to the remotest areas.
[2838.50 --> 2843.04]  So children all around the world that may never get another gift but this one.
[2843.04 --> 2846.86]  So remember to pray once you packed your item in there.
[2847.32 --> 2847.58]  Okay.
[2848.06 --> 2850.94]  Now, before we go, I would like to say a quick prayer.
[2851.30 --> 2852.88]  So if you can put this stuff down for a moment.
[2854.36 --> 2855.28]  Close your eyes.
[2855.52 --> 2856.16]  Fold your hands.
[2856.72 --> 2858.76]  Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for these children.
[2859.40 --> 2860.98]  Bless them as they go to Sunday school.
[2861.58 --> 2864.74]  Bless them as they pack up with their family and friends.
[2865.14 --> 2868.02]  And bless those children worldwide, wherever they may be,
[2868.40 --> 2871.22]  that they can learn about you as well through these boxes.
[2871.86 --> 2872.28]  Amen.
[2872.28 --> 2872.40]  Amen.
[2872.98 --> 2873.78]  And that's the truth.
[2873.86 --> 2876.02]  They get a box and it's a special present.
[2876.12 --> 2879.84]  But more importantly, they get to attend a special Sunday school classes
[2879.84 --> 2883.34]  and learn about God as well, which makes this a pretty special program.
[2884.06 --> 2884.32]  Okay.
[2884.60 --> 2890.50]  So before you head off to Sunday school, I would like you to put the items in this box.
[2891.10 --> 2892.08]  It's up for the paper.
[2892.52 --> 2893.08]  Keep that.
[2893.44 --> 2897.30]  And then you use the empty box and leave it with your parents.
[2897.30 --> 2898.76]  And you can fill it up.
[2899.72 --> 2901.42]  And off to Sunday school you go.
[2901.42 --> 2903.54]  So please put those items here.
[2904.10 --> 2906.10]  And then off you go.
[2906.34 --> 2907.36]  Have a good morning.
[2910.36 --> 2911.46]  Did you empty yours?
[2911.46 --> 2914.30]  And thank you very much for helping.
[2914.30 --> 2917.64]  See you later, sweetie.
[2917.64 --> 2923.06]  And the rest of you, there will be more boxes in the back.
[2923.12 --> 2927.76]  If you have more questions or didn't understand something, I would be happy to explain it.
[2927.76 --> 2932.64]  And the reason we kind of show that if any of you are interested in forming a group,
[2932.76 --> 2937.32]  getting together during the week sometime and making some more products, we can do that too.
[2937.60 --> 2938.20]  Thank you.
[2938.20 --> 2939.20]  Thank you.
[2939.20 --> 2969.18]  Thank you.
[2969.40 --> 2971.74]  For our message today from the book of Romans.
[2971.94 --> 2973.92]  And so we are in Romans chapter 2.
[2974.22 --> 2978.86]  If you have a pew Bible in front of you, I invite you to turn there.
[2981.16 --> 2982.42]  Romans chapter 2.
[2983.08 --> 2987.10]  And we here are on, in your pew Bible, page 837.
[2987.10 --> 2999.32]  So we will be looking at verses 6 through 11 today.
[3003.32 --> 3004.86]  And I'll read it for us.
[3004.86 --> 3006.88]  Verse 6.
[3006.88 --> 3012.28]  God will give to each person according to what he has done.
[3012.96 --> 3021.84]  To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life.
[3021.84 --> 3031.32]  But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
[3031.32 --> 3039.00]  There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then the Gentile.
[3039.00 --> 3049.76]  For God does not show favoritism.
[3049.76 --> 3049.80]  Amen.
[3050.56 --> 3051.76]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3054.30 --> 3059.78]  Would you join me in prayer as we come before the Lord our God?
[3059.92 --> 3060.66]  Let's pray together.
[3060.66 --> 3067.86]  Lord, thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[3068.92 --> 3074.68]  Thank you that when you speak, that you not only speak, but you enable us to hear.
[3075.64 --> 3081.32]  Your self opening our hearts, our ears, our eyes.
[3081.32 --> 3091.24]  And bless us as we listen eagerly with hearts desiring to draw near to you for our salvation's sake and for the glory of God.
[3091.82 --> 3093.10]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3093.36 --> 3093.58]  Amen.
[3095.72 --> 3103.50]  So growing up here in Canada, going to school, you know, in the elementary school and the older grades,
[3104.18 --> 3107.94]  every fall my kids take a trip to the salmon hatchery.
[3108.90 --> 3111.10]  Seems to me a very Canadian thing to do.
[3111.88 --> 3114.94]  To go to a salmon hatchery, at least here in B.C.
[3116.30 --> 3126.04]  When I grew up on the East Coast, the field trip that I remember doing every fall as a student in elementary school was to go to an apple orchard.
[3127.00 --> 3132.42]  And there's not, there's nothing quite like, you know, being a kid, climbing up into an apple tree,
[3132.90 --> 3139.12]  picking a Macintosh apple off the tree, kind of, you know, shining it up and taking a big bite.
[3139.12 --> 3145.94]  It's one of the joys of growing up where I did.
[3147.00 --> 3152.42]  And, you know, some of the trees have plentiful amount of apples, big, shiny apples.
[3152.42 --> 3156.16]  Other trees, the apples were smaller, fewer.
[3157.04 --> 3162.58]  But when you walk into an apple orchard and you see a tree just like laden with apples,
[3163.08 --> 3166.22]  what does that tell you about the tree?
[3166.22 --> 3171.70]  It tells you it's a healthy tree, right?
[3171.76 --> 3174.58]  The tree is doing what it ought to do.
[3175.22 --> 3181.68]  The apple tree gets like the right mixture of nutrients from the soil, from the sun, from the water,
[3181.68 --> 3183.88]  and it does what it's supposed to do.
[3183.94 --> 3184.60]  It grows apples.
[3185.76 --> 3191.84]  And then schoolchildren come, they climb up into their branches, and they fill big bags full of apples.
[3191.84 --> 3200.86]  And additionally, we'd say that if an apple farmer, an orchardist, I don't know,
[3201.46 --> 3208.72]  if the apple farmer, he walks through the orchard and notices a tree that is failing to produce apples,
[3209.38 --> 3211.06]  or maybe is only producing poor apples,
[3211.74 --> 3218.38]  the only conclusion such a person would reach is that there's something wrong with the tree, right?
[3218.38 --> 3223.16]  Maybe the tree is unhealthy, maybe it's dying, or something else is wrong with it.
[3225.10 --> 3232.22]  Well, in a similar way, what Paul is arguing in our text today is that good works,
[3233.16 --> 3239.48]  a life of obedience to God, seeking after God, is like apples, right?
[3239.52 --> 3244.34]  They are proof that our faith, our relationship with God is a healthy one,
[3244.34 --> 3246.08]  that it is real and authentic.
[3246.08 --> 3251.86]  Just like apples are proof that a tree is healthy.
[3252.90 --> 3258.76]  So just as a healthy apple tree produces good, big, bright red apples,
[3259.26 --> 3265.06]  so a true saving faith produces fruit of good works.
[3265.06 --> 3275.34]  And like a farmer who tends an apple orchard, God will look at the fruit that our lives produce
[3275.34 --> 3279.40]  and that he will judge according to that.
[3280.36 --> 3281.88]  That's what Paul is saying here.
[3282.98 --> 3285.50]  Okay, so let's look at verse 6.
[3285.50 --> 3287.74]  Verse 6 says,
[3287.74 --> 3301.44]  Now, as the title of the sermon, as John said, as we started, judgment by works.
[3302.82 --> 3303.18]  Okay.
[3304.10 --> 3306.66]  So we have a tricky issue before us today.
[3307.34 --> 3309.50]  A tricky issue that we have to wrestle with.
[3310.12 --> 3313.02]  Now, what is the tricky issue that is before us?
[3313.02 --> 3314.50]  Well, let's just come right out and say it.
[3315.42 --> 3318.88]  When you read that verse all by itself,
[3319.76 --> 3326.12]  it sounds like Paul is maybe cracking open the door to salvation apart from Jesus.
[3327.02 --> 3327.48]  Right?
[3327.52 --> 3330.46]  It looks like maybe there is a different path.
[3331.40 --> 3332.56]  Just do good works.
[3332.56 --> 3335.84]  And maybe if you do enough good works,
[3336.26 --> 3339.68]  and that maybe if your good works outweigh your bad deeds,
[3339.78 --> 3343.10]  maybe God will then accept you and take you to heaven.
[3344.54 --> 3347.56]  That is actually the way a lot of people think about Christianity.
[3348.88 --> 3350.38]  But here's the tricky part.
[3351.22 --> 3353.36]  Doesn't the rest of the book of Romans,
[3353.46 --> 3354.76]  doesn't the rest of the Bible,
[3355.68 --> 3359.46]  actually teach that we are justified by faith alone?
[3359.46 --> 3359.94]  Right?
[3360.90 --> 3362.72]  Isn't this Reformation Sunday?
[3363.14 --> 3363.28]  Right?
[3363.52 --> 3364.90]  The Reformation discovered,
[3365.48 --> 3367.36]  as it went back to the Bible,
[3367.80 --> 3371.82]  that salvation is based on the gracious doings of God,
[3372.72 --> 3373.84]  and not my doing.
[3375.68 --> 3377.86]  And this was read for us earlier.
[3378.40 --> 3381.04]  Let's look at Romans chapter 3, verse 20.
[3382.46 --> 3389.06]  Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law.
[3389.46 --> 3393.36]  Rather, through the law, we become conscience of our sin.
[3395.12 --> 3400.48]  Then if we drop down in chapter 3 and look at verse 28,
[3401.78 --> 3402.32]  it says,
[3402.58 --> 3405.52]  For we maintain that a person is justified by faith,
[3405.78 --> 3407.60]  apart from the works of the law.
[3409.12 --> 3410.18]  And then if we keep going,
[3410.44 --> 3411.72]  chapter 4, verse 5.
[3411.72 --> 3415.76]  However, to the one who does not work,
[3415.98 --> 3417.08]  but trusts God,
[3417.24 --> 3418.74]  who justifies the ungodly,
[3419.08 --> 3422.44]  their faith is credited as righteousness.
[3424.04 --> 3427.94]  So as we wrestle with what Paul is saying here,
[3428.52 --> 3430.82]  let's first just erase from our minds,
[3431.14 --> 3431.86]  from our hearts,
[3431.94 --> 3432.68]  from our thoughts,
[3432.96 --> 3435.20]  any sort of idea that we could possibly
[3435.20 --> 3437.82]  construe this passage in such a way
[3437.82 --> 3441.72]  as though people can earn,
[3442.36 --> 3444.50]  do good works to earn something from God.
[3445.36 --> 3446.18]  Let's just get rid of that.
[3446.70 --> 3450.54]  Or that we can do enough good works to earn heaven,
[3450.78 --> 3452.84]  or to become right with God.
[3453.90 --> 3456.72]  Okay, the rest of the Bible says that is clearly not the case.
[3456.72 --> 3460.22]  We cannot be justified before God by our works,
[3460.38 --> 3461.52]  by what we do.
[3462.22 --> 3464.78]  We can only be justified before God
[3464.78 --> 3466.50]  because of what Christ has done for us.
[3466.80 --> 3468.08]  His righteousness,
[3469.10 --> 3470.20]  his perfect righteousness,
[3470.44 --> 3473.18]  that we receive on our account
[3473.18 --> 3474.36]  through faith in him,
[3474.96 --> 3477.94]  as we turn to him in repentance.
[3479.70 --> 3480.38]  But,
[3480.62 --> 3482.44]  when we do that,
[3482.52 --> 3485.12]  when we receive the righteousness of Christ,
[3485.12 --> 3487.56]  that is alien to ourselves,
[3487.76 --> 3489.94]  but that becomes credited to us,
[3490.38 --> 3491.98]  what that results in
[3491.98 --> 3493.78]  is the fruit of faith,
[3494.28 --> 3494.86]  good works.
[3495.70 --> 3495.88]  Right?
[3496.12 --> 3498.40]  And so the indispensable proof
[3498.40 --> 3500.40]  that your faith is in Jesus Christ
[3500.40 --> 3501.88]  and in his righteousness alone
[3501.88 --> 3504.14]  is that good works will flow out
[3504.14 --> 3505.80]  of your relationship with Christ.
[3506.80 --> 3509.24]  You will be like a healthy tree
[3509.24 --> 3512.12]  that has its roots anchored in Christ,
[3512.48 --> 3514.08]  and you, because of that health,
[3514.08 --> 3515.34]  you produce good fruit.
[3516.42 --> 3518.52]  And this is a very important point
[3518.52 --> 3519.34]  that Paul is making,
[3519.46 --> 3520.96]  and so we need to take this seriously
[3520.96 --> 3523.26]  and also feel the weightiness of it,
[3523.76 --> 3527.40]  that we are to produce good fruit.
[3527.66 --> 3528.92]  We should not ignore that.
[3529.36 --> 3531.64]  He's saying that our salvation, then,
[3531.72 --> 3532.50]  is based,
[3532.50 --> 3536.64]  is not based,
[3536.64 --> 3536.92]  sorry,
[3537.00 --> 3537.82]  on our good deeds.
[3538.94 --> 3540.46]  Our salvation is not based
[3540.46 --> 3541.10]  on our good deeds,
[3541.22 --> 3541.52]  but,
[3542.12 --> 3543.88]  we will be judged
[3543.88 --> 3546.32]  according to our deeds.
[3546.96 --> 3548.16]  Those two things are true.
[3548.94 --> 3549.60]  So, again,
[3549.76 --> 3550.02]  here's our,
[3550.20 --> 3551.34]  here's the truth
[3551.34 --> 3552.48]  that we have before us.
[3552.94 --> 3553.90]  In verse 6,
[3553.96 --> 3554.30]  says,
[3554.38 --> 3555.94]  God will repay each person
[3555.94 --> 3557.24]  according to what they have done.
[3557.24 --> 3558.94]  So now,
[3559.58 --> 3562.02]  is this teaching
[3562.02 --> 3564.54]  found anywhere else in Scripture?
[3565.98 --> 3567.06]  Yes, it is.
[3567.44 --> 3567.70]  Okay?
[3567.88 --> 3568.68]  And actually,
[3568.80 --> 3570.00]  you see here in the NIV,
[3570.34 --> 3571.18]  it puts quotes
[3571.18 --> 3572.38]  in verse 6,
[3572.62 --> 3573.36]  and that's because
[3573.36 --> 3574.14]  Paul is quoting
[3574.14 --> 3575.88]  from Psalm 62,
[3576.14 --> 3576.78]  verse 12.
[3576.98 --> 3577.14]  Okay,
[3577.18 --> 3577.78]  Psalm 62,
[3578.04 --> 3578.48]  verse 12.
[3578.72 --> 3580.12]  So let's have a look
[3580.12 --> 3581.08]  at Psalm 62,
[3581.20 --> 3581.46]  12.
[3581.46 --> 3583.62]  And we're going to read
[3583.62 --> 3584.76]  actually first in verse 11
[3584.76 --> 3585.76]  for some context.
[3586.38 --> 3587.30]  So this is what it says.
[3587.86 --> 3589.48]  One thing God has spoken,
[3590.20 --> 3591.82]  two things I have heard.
[3592.66 --> 3594.56]  Power belongs to you, God.
[3595.34 --> 3596.74]  And with you, Lord,
[3597.18 --> 3599.86]  is unfailing love.
[3600.42 --> 3601.28]  And so the psalmist
[3601.28 --> 3603.22]  is aware of God's unfailing love.
[3603.98 --> 3605.02]  And so that's a good thing
[3605.02 --> 3605.66]  to point out,
[3606.06 --> 3606.30]  right,
[3606.34 --> 3606.62]  right,
[3606.84 --> 3607.18]  you know,
[3607.26 --> 3607.80]  right away.
[3608.64 --> 3609.50]  But then,
[3609.60 --> 3611.00]  right after he says that,
[3611.46 --> 3613.08]  that God is a God of power,
[3613.18 --> 3614.14]  he's a God of love,
[3614.34 --> 3615.10]  he says,
[3615.36 --> 3618.00]  and you will reward everyone
[3618.00 --> 3619.48]  according to what
[3619.48 --> 3620.60]  they have done.
[3621.98 --> 3623.06]  Two things that God
[3623.06 --> 3624.04]  has revealed about himself.
[3624.16 --> 3626.32]  He's a God of power and love,
[3626.78 --> 3628.76]  and that he will reward people
[3628.76 --> 3630.02]  according to what they have done.
[3631.96 --> 3633.46]  We see this same idea
[3633.46 --> 3635.34]  in Job 34,
[3635.50 --> 3635.98]  verse 11.
[3637.98 --> 3638.68]  Is that it?
[3638.72 --> 3638.84]  Yeah.
[3639.54 --> 3641.18]  He repays everyone
[3641.18 --> 3643.08]  for what they have done.
[3643.64 --> 3645.00]  He brings on them
[3645.00 --> 3646.36]  what their conduct
[3646.36 --> 3647.20]  deserves.
[3648.04 --> 3648.20]  Okay,
[3648.24 --> 3649.06]  so these two verses,
[3649.20 --> 3649.30]  right,
[3649.36 --> 3650.50]  from Job and from Psalms,
[3650.58 --> 3651.74]  these maybe are
[3651.74 --> 3652.98]  the immediate verses
[3652.98 --> 3654.60]  that Paul has in mind
[3654.60 --> 3655.94]  in Romans 2.
[3657.70 --> 3659.06]  But what about
[3659.06 --> 3659.76]  elsewhere
[3659.76 --> 3660.82]  in the Old Testament?
[3661.92 --> 3662.16]  Well,
[3662.20 --> 3662.90]  let's hear what
[3662.90 --> 3664.28]  Jeremiah has to say.
[3664.78 --> 3665.60]  I'm going to give you
[3665.60 --> 3666.24]  a bunch of verses.
[3666.96 --> 3667.20]  Okay,
[3667.20 --> 3668.50]  and I want you to see
[3668.50 --> 3670.28]  that this is a major
[3670.28 --> 3671.18]  emphasis of the Bible.
[3671.18 --> 3671.60]  Okay,
[3671.74 --> 3673.26]  so Jeremiah 17,
[3673.40 --> 3673.66]  10.
[3674.38 --> 3674.70]  I,
[3674.88 --> 3675.30]  the Lord,
[3675.46 --> 3676.26]  search the heart
[3676.26 --> 3677.50]  and examine the mind
[3677.50 --> 3679.62]  to reward each person
[3679.62 --> 3681.00]  according to their conduct,
[3681.28 --> 3682.14]  according to what
[3682.14 --> 3682.84]  their deeds
[3682.84 --> 3684.18]  deserve.
[3684.18 --> 3686.86]  God is searching
[3686.86 --> 3687.38]  your heart
[3687.38 --> 3688.92]  right now.
[3690.06 --> 3691.26]  He is examining
[3691.26 --> 3692.22]  your mind
[3692.22 --> 3694.78]  and he's going to see
[3694.78 --> 3697.40]  what's in there,
[3697.52 --> 3697.74]  right,
[3697.76 --> 3698.46]  and he's going to reward
[3698.46 --> 3699.14]  us accordingly.
[3701.92 --> 3702.98]  That's what God does.
[3703.36 --> 3704.30]  He judges according
[3704.30 --> 3704.94]  to our deeds.
[3705.08 --> 3705.20]  Okay,
[3705.26 --> 3706.38]  now there's a lot more
[3706.38 --> 3707.18]  we could look at
[3707.18 --> 3707.84]  the Old Testament,
[3708.06 --> 3708.72]  but what about
[3708.72 --> 3709.48]  the New Testament?
[3710.08 --> 3711.40]  Are God's ways
[3711.40 --> 3712.62]  consistent,
[3713.06 --> 3713.24]  right,
[3713.30 --> 3714.08]  between the Old Testament
[3714.08 --> 3714.90]  and the New Testament?
[3715.74 --> 3716.20]  Well,
[3716.32 --> 3717.06]  Paul says
[3717.06 --> 3718.38]  in 2 Corinthians
[3718.38 --> 3719.74]  chapter 5,
[3719.78 --> 3720.16]  verse 10,
[3721.30 --> 3721.84]  he says,
[3722.30 --> 3723.54]  for we must all
[3723.54 --> 3724.26]  appear before
[3724.26 --> 3724.98]  the judgment seat
[3724.98 --> 3725.52]  of Christ
[3725.52 --> 3726.80]  so that each
[3726.80 --> 3727.72]  of us may receive
[3727.72 --> 3729.08]  what is due us
[3729.08 --> 3730.22]  for the things
[3730.22 --> 3731.84]  done while in the body,
[3732.04 --> 3732.72]  whether good
[3732.72 --> 3733.90]  or bad.
[3735.22 --> 3735.74]  Okay,
[3735.74 --> 3736.40]  so that's Paul.
[3737.40 --> 3738.00]  How about
[3738.00 --> 3739.38]  our Lord Jesus Christ?
[3740.26 --> 3740.60]  Well,
[3740.60 --> 3741.68]  he says in Matthew
[3741.68 --> 3742.92]  chapter 16,
[3742.98 --> 3743.60]  verse 27,
[3744.00 --> 3744.78]  for the Son of Man
[3744.78 --> 3745.64]  is going to come
[3745.64 --> 3746.84]  in his Father's glory
[3746.84 --> 3748.04]  with his angels
[3748.04 --> 3749.34]  and then he will reward
[3749.34 --> 3750.02]  each person
[3750.02 --> 3750.74]  according to what
[3750.74 --> 3751.34]  they have done.
[3753.62 --> 3754.10]  Or,
[3754.80 --> 3756.10]  John chapter 5,
[3756.14 --> 3756.70]  verse 28,
[3757.66 --> 3758.56]  do not be amazed
[3758.56 --> 3759.12]  at this,
[3759.50 --> 3760.56]  for a time is coming
[3760.56 --> 3761.40]  when all who are
[3761.40 --> 3762.16]  in their graves
[3762.16 --> 3763.24]  will hear his voice
[3763.24 --> 3764.64]  and come out.
[3765.06 --> 3765.92]  Those who have done
[3765.92 --> 3766.56]  what is good
[3766.56 --> 3767.88]  will rise to life.
[3768.16 --> 3768.86]  Those who have done
[3768.86 --> 3769.62]  what is evil
[3769.62 --> 3770.54]  will rise
[3770.54 --> 3771.56]  to be condemned.
[3772.90 --> 3773.02]  Right,
[3773.10 --> 3773.80]  and this verse
[3773.80 --> 3774.70]  is really a,
[3775.06 --> 3776.18]  is basically a summary
[3776.18 --> 3777.08]  of our passage
[3777.08 --> 3778.18]  in Romans 2.
[3779.82 --> 3780.30]  Okay,
[3780.34 --> 3781.10]  so we've had Paul,
[3781.26 --> 3781.98]  we've had Jesus,
[3782.36 --> 3783.28]  what about John?
[3784.04 --> 3784.50]  Lastly,
[3784.74 --> 3785.70]  let's look at
[3785.70 --> 3786.92]  what John says
[3786.92 --> 3787.50]  in Revelation
[3787.50 --> 3788.52]  chapter 20,
[3788.66 --> 3789.82]  verse 13.
[3789.82 --> 3791.78]  the sea
[3791.78 --> 3793.22]  gave up the dead
[3793.22 --> 3794.04]  that were in it
[3794.04 --> 3794.76]  and death
[3794.76 --> 3795.24]  and Hades
[3795.24 --> 3796.16]  gave up the dead
[3796.16 --> 3797.16]  that were in them
[3797.16 --> 3798.12]  and each person
[3798.12 --> 3798.84]  was judged
[3798.84 --> 3800.12]  according
[3800.12 --> 3801.60]  to what they had done.
[3804.74 --> 3805.22]  Lastly,
[3805.42 --> 3806.90]  Revelation chapter 22,
[3807.04 --> 3807.48]  verse 12,
[3807.60 --> 3808.22]  this is
[3808.22 --> 3809.52]  our Lord Jesus Christ
[3809.52 --> 3809.90]  speaking.
[3810.24 --> 3810.74]  He says,
[3811.10 --> 3811.80]  look,
[3812.00 --> 3813.40]  I am coming soon,
[3813.60 --> 3814.60]  my reward
[3814.60 --> 3815.40]  is with me
[3815.40 --> 3816.26]  and I will give
[3816.26 --> 3817.02]  to each person
[3817.02 --> 3817.56]  according
[3817.56 --> 3819.14]  to what they have done.
[3821.10 --> 3821.90]  Did you know
[3821.90 --> 3822.52]  all these verses
[3822.52 --> 3823.26]  are in the Bible?
[3824.56 --> 3824.78]  Right?
[3825.28 --> 3826.48]  That all of these verses
[3826.48 --> 3828.18]  speak to this reality
[3828.18 --> 3829.04]  that God
[3829.04 --> 3829.84]  will judge
[3829.84 --> 3830.40]  according
[3830.40 --> 3831.84]  to works.
[3833.28 --> 3833.92]  It's really
[3833.92 --> 3834.60]  quite amazing.
[3836.86 --> 3837.52]  And so,
[3837.64 --> 3838.00]  I think
[3838.00 --> 3839.12]  there are two things
[3839.12 --> 3840.14]  we should say
[3840.14 --> 3841.24]  about works.
[3841.58 --> 3841.66]  Right?
[3841.76 --> 3842.34]  The way
[3842.34 --> 3843.70]  that deeds,
[3844.40 --> 3845.00]  good deeds
[3845.00 --> 3845.58]  or good works,
[3845.58 --> 3846.56]  work in
[3846.56 --> 3847.64]  the Christian life.
[3848.42 --> 3848.90]  First,
[3849.10 --> 3849.64]  two truths.
[3849.80 --> 3850.06]  First,
[3850.72 --> 3851.60]  that works and deeds
[3851.60 --> 3852.78]  they cannot save
[3852.78 --> 3854.94]  because we cannot
[3854.94 --> 3856.70]  outwork
[3856.70 --> 3857.82]  our debt of sin.
[3858.66 --> 3859.26]  Right?
[3859.28 --> 3859.84]  And that's why
[3859.84 --> 3860.46]  we need
[3860.46 --> 3860.86]  Jesus'
[3861.20 --> 3862.08]  sinless,
[3862.32 --> 3863.74]  perfect righteousness,
[3864.06 --> 3865.74]  his spotless record
[3865.74 --> 3866.72]  to be credited
[3866.72 --> 3868.34]  to our account
[3868.34 --> 3870.16]  because we cannot
[3870.16 --> 3872.02]  outdo
[3872.02 --> 3873.54]  our debt of sin.
[3873.98 --> 3874.64]  It's impossible.
[3874.64 --> 3877.06]  good works
[3877.06 --> 3878.40]  cannot save us.
[3879.36 --> 3879.70]  But,
[3879.82 --> 3880.84]  second truth,
[3881.42 --> 3882.50]  works absolutely
[3882.50 --> 3883.12]  matter.
[3884.04 --> 3885.16]  And we will be
[3885.16 --> 3885.70]  judged
[3885.70 --> 3887.10]  according to them.
[3887.18 --> 3888.30]  Not based on them,
[3888.52 --> 3889.54]  but according to them.
[3890.38 --> 3890.88]  So,
[3891.04 --> 3891.78]  if you take
[3891.78 --> 3892.66]  these two truths
[3892.66 --> 3893.48]  we find in Scripture,
[3894.12 --> 3895.08]  how should the Christian
[3895.08 --> 3896.62]  think about works?
[3897.10 --> 3898.06]  You should understand
[3898.06 --> 3898.56]  them, again,
[3898.64 --> 3899.62]  not as the basis
[3899.62 --> 3900.54]  for salvation
[3900.54 --> 3902.02]  or as a means
[3902.02 --> 3902.88]  of salvation,
[3902.88 --> 3904.54]  but as evidence
[3904.54 --> 3905.52]  of salvation.
[3906.90 --> 3907.74]  We are not
[3907.74 --> 3909.24]  saved by good works,
[3909.50 --> 3910.54]  but good works
[3910.54 --> 3911.26]  demonstrate
[3911.26 --> 3912.72]  that we have been
[3912.72 --> 3913.52]  or that we are
[3913.52 --> 3914.26]  being saved.
[3915.88 --> 3916.06]  Okay?
[3916.06 --> 3916.72]  I hope that's
[3916.72 --> 3918.02]  starting to get clear.
[3918.18 --> 3918.34]  Okay?
[3919.86 --> 3920.90]  They're the fruit.
[3921.18 --> 3921.44]  Remember,
[3921.52 --> 3921.88]  just like,
[3921.94 --> 3922.52]  have that image
[3922.52 --> 3923.06]  of the fruit.
[3923.54 --> 3924.00]  Good works
[3924.00 --> 3925.38]  are a fruit
[3925.38 --> 3927.06]  that demonstrates
[3927.06 --> 3927.84]  that you are
[3927.84 --> 3928.48]  a healthy tree
[3928.48 --> 3928.82]  and you're
[3928.82 --> 3929.34]  a healthy tree
[3929.34 --> 3929.90]  because you are
[3929.90 --> 3930.66]  rooted in Christ.
[3931.04 --> 3931.84]  You're saved by him.
[3932.30 --> 3932.42]  Okay?
[3933.24 --> 3933.68]  So,
[3933.94 --> 3934.66]  and this is what
[3934.66 --> 3935.54]  Paul shows us
[3935.54 --> 3936.38]  in this passage.
[3937.00 --> 3937.44]  Paul says,
[3937.78 --> 3938.72]  on the day of judgment,
[3939.02 --> 3939.76]  God is going to
[3939.76 --> 3940.42]  sort out
[3940.42 --> 3942.28]  those who have
[3942.28 --> 3943.08]  stubborn,
[3943.40 --> 3945.02]  unrepentant hearts.
[3945.34 --> 3946.00]  And you see that
[3946.00 --> 3947.50]  in Romans chapter 2,
[3947.54 --> 3948.12]  verse 5.
[3949.80 --> 3950.32]  From
[3950.32 --> 3951.90]  those who
[3951.90 --> 3952.86]  are truly
[3952.86 --> 3954.06]  repentant.
[3954.44 --> 3954.60]  Okay?
[3954.98 --> 3955.92]  Unrepentant hearts
[3955.92 --> 3957.42]  and repentant hearts.
[3957.84 --> 3958.32]  And the way
[3958.32 --> 3959.00]  God is going
[3959.00 --> 3959.98]  to sort that out
[3959.98 --> 3960.78]  because the day
[3960.78 --> 3961.20]  of judgment
[3961.20 --> 3962.02]  will be public,
[3962.72 --> 3963.96]  God can see our hearts
[3963.96 --> 3964.66]  but not everybody
[3964.66 --> 3965.62]  can see our hearts.
[3966.10 --> 3966.22]  So,
[3966.30 --> 3966.88]  God is going
[3966.88 --> 3967.74]  to judge
[3967.74 --> 3969.64]  based on
[3969.64 --> 3970.50]  the works
[3970.50 --> 3971.08]  that are evident
[3971.08 --> 3971.78]  to all.
[3972.90 --> 3973.36]  He is going
[3973.36 --> 3973.94]  to inspect
[3973.94 --> 3974.62]  the fruit.
[3975.04 --> 3975.44]  That's how
[3975.44 --> 3976.26]  he will know
[3976.26 --> 3978.50]  if he has done
[3978.50 --> 3979.12]  that work of grace
[3979.12 --> 3979.74]  in your life.
[3980.32 --> 3980.48]  Okay?
[3981.46 --> 3981.80]  He's going to
[3981.80 --> 3982.46]  inspect the fruit.
[3982.60 --> 3983.04]  It's evidence.
[3983.52 --> 3983.68]  So,
[3983.80 --> 3984.42]  here's the question
[3984.42 --> 3985.02]  that God is going
[3985.02 --> 3985.90]  to ask on that day.
[3986.42 --> 3986.90]  God is going
[3986.90 --> 3987.62]  to ask the question,
[3987.94 --> 3988.72]  how have you
[3988.72 --> 3989.34]  responded
[3989.34 --> 3990.50]  to my kindness?
[3991.48 --> 3992.20]  How have you
[3992.20 --> 3993.64]  responded to my grace?
[3994.18 --> 3994.88]  That's the question.
[3995.90 --> 3996.34]  And there are
[3996.34 --> 3997.00]  two different
[3997.00 --> 3997.84]  responses
[3997.84 --> 3999.04]  that we see here
[3999.04 --> 3999.54]  in our text.
[3999.60 --> 4000.80]  There's two kinds
[4000.80 --> 4001.54]  of people.
[4001.76 --> 4002.30]  Two responses.
[4003.08 --> 4003.44]  So,
[4003.48 --> 4004.12]  here's the first
[4004.12 --> 4004.66]  response
[4004.66 --> 4005.76]  in verse 7.
[4007.32 --> 4008.14]  To those
[4008.14 --> 4009.52]  who by persistence
[4009.52 --> 4010.38]  in doing good
[4010.38 --> 4011.34]  seek glory,
[4011.56 --> 4011.76]  honor,
[4011.88 --> 4012.68]  and immortality,
[4012.96 --> 4013.68]  he will give
[4013.68 --> 4014.46]  eternal life.
[4014.46 --> 4015.92]  So,
[4015.96 --> 4016.36]  he's talking
[4016.36 --> 4017.14]  about Christians,
[4017.74 --> 4019.04]  those who have
[4019.04 --> 4020.54]  already responded
[4020.54 --> 4022.48]  to God's kindness
[4022.48 --> 4023.60]  and to his grace
[4023.60 --> 4025.14]  with repentant hearts.
[4025.64 --> 4026.54]  They are those
[4026.54 --> 4027.14]  who respond
[4027.14 --> 4028.18]  to God's grace
[4028.18 --> 4030.32]  by persisting
[4030.32 --> 4030.94]  in doing good.
[4032.38 --> 4032.96]  So,
[4033.02 --> 4033.84]  just as an example
[4033.84 --> 4034.42]  of this kind
[4034.42 --> 4034.86]  of response
[4034.86 --> 4035.76]  to God's kindness,
[4035.96 --> 4036.46]  do you remember
[4036.46 --> 4037.06]  the story
[4037.06 --> 4038.46]  of Zacchaeus?
[4039.06 --> 4039.48]  Right?
[4039.48 --> 4040.60]  Think of Zacchaeus,
[4040.76 --> 4041.60]  the short guy,
[4042.28 --> 4043.44]  the second shortest
[4043.44 --> 4044.46]  man in the Bible.
[4045.36 --> 4046.74]  Who is the first
[4046.74 --> 4047.50]  shortest man
[4047.50 --> 4047.96]  in the Bible?
[4048.72 --> 4049.06]  Do you know?
[4050.54 --> 4051.36]  Knee high Maya.
[4054.96 --> 4055.56]  Okay.
[4056.56 --> 4057.12]  So,
[4057.26 --> 4057.70]  Zacchaeus,
[4057.70 --> 4058.60]  I heard a groan.
[4059.98 --> 4060.20]  Okay.
[4060.86 --> 4061.46]  Zacchaeus,
[4062.14 --> 4063.54]  the second shortest
[4063.54 --> 4063.76]  man,
[4064.00 --> 4064.78]  climbs a tree.
[4065.48 --> 4066.28]  You can read about it
[4066.28 --> 4067.66]  in Luke chapter 19.
[4068.64 --> 4069.22]  And the thing
[4069.22 --> 4069.88]  with Zacchaeus
[4069.88 --> 4070.50]  is that he is
[4070.50 --> 4071.22]  a huge jerk.
[4072.42 --> 4073.62]  He was a cheat.
[4073.88 --> 4074.98]  He was a tax collector
[4074.98 --> 4076.00]  and he collected
[4076.00 --> 4077.02]  more taxes
[4077.02 --> 4077.92]  than he was supposed to.
[4078.56 --> 4078.76]  So,
[4078.82 --> 4079.34]  he was basically
[4079.34 --> 4080.20]  stealing from people
[4080.20 --> 4081.48]  and everybody knew it
[4081.48 --> 4083.00]  and everybody hated him
[4083.00 --> 4083.60]  for it.
[4084.70 --> 4085.36]  And then Jesus,
[4085.64 --> 4086.78]  Jesus comes to town
[4086.78 --> 4087.22]  and Jesus,
[4087.42 --> 4087.64]  you know,
[4087.80 --> 4089.24]  he sees Zacchaeus
[4089.24 --> 4090.30]  up in the sycamore tree
[4090.30 --> 4090.92]  and he says,
[4091.06 --> 4091.40]  Zacchaeus,
[4091.46 --> 4091.98]  come down.
[4092.10 --> 4092.78]  I am going
[4092.78 --> 4093.86]  to your house
[4093.86 --> 4094.62]  for dinner.
[4094.62 --> 4096.06]  That's the way
[4096.06 --> 4096.54]  I like to do
[4096.54 --> 4097.12]  my invitations.
[4098.34 --> 4099.88]  And that is
[4099.88 --> 4100.34]  a little weird
[4100.34 --> 4100.96]  but it doesn't really
[4100.96 --> 4102.00]  sound that weird.
[4102.12 --> 4102.64]  We can kind of
[4102.64 --> 4103.42]  understand that.
[4104.08 --> 4104.94]  But this was
[4104.94 --> 4106.30]  absolutely massive
[4106.30 --> 4108.26]  for Zacchaeus
[4108.26 --> 4110.18]  because at the time
[4110.18 --> 4111.68]  moral people,
[4111.82 --> 4112.62]  religious people
[4112.62 --> 4113.36]  like Jesus,
[4113.64 --> 4114.50]  a teacher of the law,
[4114.74 --> 4115.76]  would not eat
[4115.76 --> 4116.86]  with immoral people.
[4117.30 --> 4118.12]  It just didn't happen.
[4118.20 --> 4119.04]  It was not appropriate.
[4120.32 --> 4121.30]  And so when Jesus said,
[4121.36 --> 4121.70]  Zacchaeus,
[4121.74 --> 4122.18]  I am coming
[4122.18 --> 4123.22]  to your house,
[4123.22 --> 4125.88]  Zacchaeus realized
[4125.88 --> 4126.58]  that Jesus
[4126.58 --> 4127.98]  was showing him
[4127.98 --> 4130.10]  immense,
[4130.28 --> 4131.58]  phenomenal kindness,
[4132.52 --> 4133.38]  amazing mercy,
[4133.56 --> 4134.54]  amazing grace,
[4135.18 --> 4135.92]  unheard of.
[4137.60 --> 4137.94]  Now,
[4138.18 --> 4138.66]  do you remember
[4138.66 --> 4139.44]  how Zacchaeus
[4139.44 --> 4140.18]  responded
[4140.18 --> 4142.08]  to Jesus' kindness?
[4143.14 --> 4143.34]  All right,
[4143.38 --> 4143.72]  they're sitting
[4143.72 --> 4144.62]  at the dinner table.
[4145.78 --> 4146.30]  Zacchaeus,
[4147.20 --> 4147.56]  you know,
[4148.28 --> 4149.44]  did Zacchaeus
[4149.44 --> 4150.26]  say to himself
[4150.26 --> 4151.12]  or think to himself,
[4151.58 --> 4151.88]  well,
[4151.98 --> 4152.14]  you know,
[4152.14 --> 4153.04]  Jesus wanted to come
[4153.04 --> 4153.84]  and have dinner with me
[4153.84 --> 4155.78]  even though I'm a,
[4155.78 --> 4156.06]  you know,
[4156.10 --> 4156.88]  rotten scoundrel.
[4157.58 --> 4158.56]  That must mean
[4158.56 --> 4159.72]  he doesn't really mind.
[4159.76 --> 4160.24]  I can just go
[4160.24 --> 4160.96]  on cheating people.
[4162.16 --> 4163.04]  Is that what happened?
[4163.24 --> 4164.06]  Is that what he thought?
[4164.52 --> 4165.04]  Well, no.
[4165.46 --> 4166.32]  That's not what happened.
[4166.40 --> 4167.16]  That's not what he thought.
[4167.32 --> 4168.32]  What happened is
[4168.32 --> 4168.96]  he saw
[4168.96 --> 4169.88]  the kindness
[4169.88 --> 4170.82]  of God to him
[4170.82 --> 4172.64]  and there's Jesus
[4172.64 --> 4174.02]  sitting at the table
[4174.02 --> 4174.90]  with Zacchaeus,
[4175.48 --> 4176.42]  table fellowship,
[4176.60 --> 4177.40]  eating with him,
[4178.40 --> 4179.66]  and something clicks
[4179.66 --> 4181.34]  in Zacchaeus' heart.
[4182.24 --> 4183.80]  All of his life
[4183.80 --> 4184.42]  he had been
[4184.42 --> 4185.56]  running away from God.
[4185.64 --> 4186.10]  He's been
[4186.10 --> 4187.40]  ignoring God
[4187.40 --> 4188.66]  but all of a sudden
[4188.66 --> 4189.80]  he sees the kindness
[4189.80 --> 4190.40]  of Jesus
[4190.40 --> 4191.88]  showed toward him
[4191.88 --> 4192.68]  and something
[4192.68 --> 4193.58]  in his heart
[4193.58 --> 4194.28]  changes
[4194.28 --> 4196.34]  and he stands up
[4196.34 --> 4196.78]  and he says,
[4197.16 --> 4197.36]  Jesus,
[4197.48 --> 4198.24]  I'm giving all
[4198.24 --> 4199.20]  my money back
[4199.20 --> 4200.42]  that I have stolen.
[4201.06 --> 4201.66]  Plus,
[4201.86 --> 4202.72]  I'm going to give away
[4202.72 --> 4203.52]  even more money
[4203.52 --> 4204.50]  that I actually
[4204.50 --> 4205.58]  took legitimately.
[4205.58 --> 4207.58]  See,
[4207.66 --> 4208.48]  Jesus' kindness
[4208.48 --> 4209.24]  and his grace
[4209.24 --> 4211.18]  drew Zacchaeus
[4211.18 --> 4212.10]  to himself
[4212.10 --> 4213.98]  and that's,
[4214.02 --> 4214.14]  you know,
[4214.18 --> 4214.70]  that's always
[4214.70 --> 4215.38]  what happens
[4215.38 --> 4217.24]  when you truly
[4217.24 --> 4218.74]  catch the kindness
[4218.74 --> 4219.42]  of God
[4219.42 --> 4220.48]  shown toward you.
[4221.16 --> 4221.76]  When you see
[4221.76 --> 4222.26]  the beauty
[4222.26 --> 4223.02]  of God's kindness,
[4223.26 --> 4223.76]  there's something
[4223.76 --> 4225.24]  remarkably attractive
[4225.24 --> 4226.24]  about it
[4226.24 --> 4227.40]  and it makes you
[4227.40 --> 4227.84]  want to go
[4227.84 --> 4228.82]  closer to God.
[4228.92 --> 4229.28]  It makes you
[4229.28 --> 4229.82]  want to draw
[4229.82 --> 4231.04]  near to God.
[4231.60 --> 4232.06]  It makes you
[4232.06 --> 4232.86]  want to push away
[4232.86 --> 4233.52]  everything
[4233.52 --> 4235.26]  that would stand
[4235.26 --> 4235.92]  in the way
[4235.92 --> 4236.76]  between you
[4236.76 --> 4237.26]  and God.
[4238.14 --> 4238.98]  Every sin,
[4239.72 --> 4240.52]  anything that would
[4240.52 --> 4241.10]  stand in the way,
[4241.28 --> 4241.78]  you just want
[4241.78 --> 4242.38]  to get rid of it.
[4243.74 --> 4244.66]  And you want
[4244.66 --> 4245.50]  to seek
[4245.50 --> 4246.82]  glory
[4246.82 --> 4248.30]  and honor
[4248.30 --> 4249.48]  and immortality
[4249.48 --> 4250.06]  which is another
[4250.06 --> 4250.72]  way of saying
[4250.72 --> 4251.74]  you want to seek
[4251.74 --> 4252.90]  God himself.
[4253.58 --> 4254.26]  You want to seek
[4254.26 --> 4254.90]  the glory
[4254.90 --> 4255.98]  that comes from God.
[4256.04 --> 4256.34]  You want to seek
[4256.34 --> 4256.90]  the honor
[4256.90 --> 4257.84]  that is given
[4257.84 --> 4258.36]  by God,
[4258.44 --> 4258.94]  not that you can
[4258.94 --> 4259.60]  try to get
[4259.60 --> 4260.36]  from the world.
[4260.36 --> 4262.72]  And what will
[4262.72 --> 4263.22]  God do?
[4263.82 --> 4264.84]  He will give
[4264.84 --> 4265.52]  eternal life
[4265.52 --> 4266.20]  to such people.
[4267.28 --> 4268.22]  Not because
[4268.22 --> 4269.24]  they did a good deed,
[4269.36 --> 4271.06]  but because
[4271.06 --> 4272.82]  that fruit
[4272.82 --> 4274.32]  is evidence
[4274.32 --> 4275.32]  of a transformation
[4275.32 --> 4275.98]  that happened
[4275.98 --> 4276.60]  in the heart.
[4277.18 --> 4277.98]  A repentance
[4277.98 --> 4279.22]  and a faith
[4279.22 --> 4280.54]  that receives
[4280.54 --> 4281.74]  the grace of God.
[4282.94 --> 4283.62]  So that's the
[4283.62 --> 4284.44]  first group of people
[4284.44 --> 4285.66]  but that's not
[4285.66 --> 4286.60]  the only response
[4286.60 --> 4287.30]  that we see.
[4287.88 --> 4288.50]  There's a second
[4288.50 --> 4289.46]  group of people
[4289.46 --> 4290.20]  who respond
[4290.20 --> 4290.68]  differently
[4290.68 --> 4291.40]  to God's kindness
[4291.40 --> 4292.98]  and we read
[4292.98 --> 4293.46]  about them
[4293.46 --> 4294.02]  in verse 8.
[4295.96 --> 4296.96]  But for those
[4296.96 --> 4297.48]  who are
[4297.48 --> 4298.48]  self-seeking
[4298.48 --> 4299.68]  and who reject
[4299.68 --> 4300.18]  the truth
[4300.18 --> 4301.14]  and follow evil
[4301.14 --> 4302.24]  there will be
[4302.24 --> 4303.08]  wrath and anger.
[4304.84 --> 4305.40]  And so these
[4305.40 --> 4306.04]  are people,
[4306.24 --> 4306.64]  it's a different
[4306.64 --> 4306.96]  group,
[4307.04 --> 4307.60]  who respond
[4307.60 --> 4308.36]  to God's kindness
[4308.36 --> 4309.12]  and his grace
[4309.12 --> 4310.66]  using it
[4310.66 --> 4311.64]  as an excuse
[4311.64 --> 4312.62]  to seek
[4312.62 --> 4313.22]  themselves.
[4314.70 --> 4314.80]  Right?
[4316.88 --> 4317.40]  Seeking
[4317.40 --> 4318.04]  independence
[4318.04 --> 4318.68]  from God.
[4320.20 --> 4321.34]  And as an excuse
[4321.34 --> 4322.36]  not to obey
[4322.36 --> 4322.88]  the truth.
[4324.16 --> 4324.68]  And so think
[4324.68 --> 4325.38]  about Zacchaeus
[4325.38 --> 4325.64]  again.
[4326.76 --> 4327.72]  After Zacchaeus
[4327.72 --> 4328.30]  he gave back
[4328.30 --> 4329.00]  all that money
[4329.00 --> 4329.64]  that was stolen.
[4330.64 --> 4331.18]  Right then
[4331.18 --> 4332.24]  Jesus stands up,
[4332.72 --> 4333.48]  he points
[4333.48 --> 4334.24]  at Zacchaeus
[4334.24 --> 4335.10]  and he says,
[4335.24 --> 4335.82]  look everybody,
[4336.92 --> 4337.88]  that is what
[4337.88 --> 4339.14]  real repentance
[4339.14 --> 4340.52]  looks like.
[4341.96 --> 4343.62]  That is a true
[4343.62 --> 4345.30]  son of Abraham.
[4345.30 --> 4345.40]  Abraham.
[4346.70 --> 4347.18]  Today,
[4347.58 --> 4348.06]  salvation
[4348.06 --> 4349.12]  has come
[4349.12 --> 4349.84]  to this house.
[4351.08 --> 4351.88]  Why did
[4351.88 --> 4352.70]  Jesus say that?
[4353.40 --> 4354.18]  He said it
[4354.18 --> 4354.72]  because
[4354.72 --> 4355.90]  Zacchaeus'
[4356.04 --> 4356.78]  actions,
[4357.30 --> 4357.46]  right,
[4357.56 --> 4358.06]  giving away
[4358.06 --> 4358.56]  all that money
[4358.56 --> 4359.34]  that he stole,
[4359.60 --> 4360.58]  it proved
[4360.58 --> 4361.66]  that money
[4361.66 --> 4362.64]  was no longer
[4362.64 --> 4363.48]  his true God.
[4364.32 --> 4365.50]  It proved
[4365.50 --> 4366.22]  that he was
[4366.22 --> 4366.72]  no longer
[4366.72 --> 4367.92]  self-seeking.
[4369.32 --> 4370.46]  That he no longer
[4370.46 --> 4371.12]  rejected
[4371.12 --> 4372.26]  the truth.
[4372.26 --> 4375.76]  the truth
[4375.76 --> 4376.26]  that his deeds
[4376.26 --> 4376.76]  were sinful
[4376.76 --> 4377.20]  and that he
[4377.20 --> 4377.74]  was rejecting
[4377.74 --> 4378.18]  God.
[4379.28 --> 4379.40]  Right,
[4379.48 --> 4380.72]  his good works,
[4380.80 --> 4381.60]  his response
[4381.60 --> 4382.70]  to God's grace
[4382.70 --> 4383.56]  proved that God
[4383.56 --> 4384.44]  was now
[4384.44 --> 4385.34]  his highest
[4385.34 --> 4385.88]  priority.
[4386.32 --> 4386.94]  It proved
[4386.94 --> 4387.50]  that his
[4387.50 --> 4388.96]  life had been
[4388.96 --> 4389.76]  transformed
[4389.76 --> 4391.00]  by God.
[4391.40 --> 4391.94]  Money wasn't
[4391.94 --> 4392.36]  his highest
[4392.36 --> 4392.76]  priority.
[4393.12 --> 4393.84]  Zacchaeus himself
[4393.84 --> 4394.40]  was not his
[4394.40 --> 4394.98]  own highest
[4394.98 --> 4395.46]  priority.
[4396.16 --> 4396.82]  God was his
[4396.82 --> 4397.88]  highest priority.
[4400.32 --> 4400.82]  So then
[4400.82 --> 4401.30]  in verses
[4401.30 --> 4404.42]  9 and 10
[4404.42 --> 4406.54]  we have
[4406.54 --> 4407.14]  a picture
[4407.14 --> 4407.46]  of these
[4407.46 --> 4408.08]  two trees.
[4408.66 --> 4409.04]  There's these
[4409.04 --> 4409.78]  two different
[4409.78 --> 4410.28]  trees
[4410.28 --> 4411.92]  that bear
[4411.92 --> 4413.24]  two different
[4413.24 --> 4413.88]  kinds of fruit.
[4414.38 --> 4415.26]  One out of
[4415.26 --> 4415.70]  repentance,
[4416.20 --> 4416.92]  the fruit of
[4416.92 --> 4417.52]  good works,
[4417.80 --> 4418.42]  persistence in
[4418.42 --> 4418.98]  good works,
[4419.28 --> 4419.92]  seeking God,
[4421.24 --> 4422.12]  the tree of
[4422.12 --> 4422.68]  stubborn,
[4422.86 --> 4423.82]  unrepentant hearts
[4423.82 --> 4424.82]  that produce the
[4424.82 --> 4425.92]  fruit of
[4425.92 --> 4426.66]  continuing to do
[4426.66 --> 4427.56]  evil and being
[4427.56 --> 4428.06]  self-centered.
[4428.56 --> 4429.06]  And then
[4429.06 --> 4430.48]  there's a harvest,
[4430.48 --> 4431.28]  just like the
[4431.28 --> 4431.92]  kids up in the
[4431.92 --> 4432.48]  tree harvesting
[4432.48 --> 4432.98]  those apples,
[4433.40 --> 4433.72]  there's going
[4433.72 --> 4433.96]  to be a
[4433.96 --> 4434.86]  harvest of
[4434.86 --> 4435.34]  this fruit.
[4436.10 --> 4436.62]  And that's
[4436.62 --> 4437.34]  what we have
[4437.34 --> 4438.86]  here in
[4438.86 --> 4440.60]  verses 9 and
[4440.60 --> 4440.82]  10.
[4441.64 --> 4442.38]  So let's read
[4442.38 --> 4442.78]  this.
[4443.64 --> 4444.36]  There will be
[4444.36 --> 4445.22]  trouble and
[4445.22 --> 4445.80]  distress for
[4445.80 --> 4446.48]  every human
[4446.48 --> 4447.38]  being who
[4447.38 --> 4447.94]  does evil,
[4448.36 --> 4448.90]  first for the
[4448.90 --> 4449.06]  Jew,
[4449.16 --> 4449.42]  then the
[4449.42 --> 4449.86]  Gentile,
[4450.40 --> 4451.46]  but glory,
[4451.68 --> 4451.86]  honor,
[4451.86 --> 4452.48]  and peace for
[4452.48 --> 4452.98]  everyone who
[4452.98 --> 4453.50]  does good,
[4453.78 --> 4454.24]  first for the
[4454.24 --> 4454.50]  Jew,
[4454.64 --> 4455.16]  then for the
[4455.16 --> 4455.54]  Gentile.
[4457.22 --> 4457.72]  Okay, so on
[4457.72 --> 4458.14]  this day of
[4458.14 --> 4458.92]  judgment, God's
[4458.92 --> 4459.36]  going to look
[4459.36 --> 4459.86]  at the fruit
[4459.86 --> 4460.62]  of our lives
[4460.62 --> 4461.96]  as evidence
[4461.96 --> 4462.92]  of how we
[4462.92 --> 4463.78]  responded to
[4463.78 --> 4464.36]  God's mercy
[4464.36 --> 4464.90]  and kindness.
[4465.46 --> 4466.28]  For those who
[4466.28 --> 4467.52]  reject God's
[4467.52 --> 4469.04]  kindness, God
[4469.04 --> 4469.40]  is going to
[4469.40 --> 4469.90]  give them what
[4469.90 --> 4470.34]  they always
[4470.34 --> 4470.74]  wanted,
[4471.62 --> 4472.16]  independence
[4472.16 --> 4473.08]  from him.
[4476.04 --> 4476.60]  Tragically,
[4477.66 --> 4479.16]  apart from
[4479.16 --> 4480.08]  God, the only
[4480.08 --> 4480.56]  thing that
[4480.56 --> 4482.12]  remains is
[4482.12 --> 4482.70]  trouble and
[4482.70 --> 4483.12]  distress.
[4483.96 --> 4484.70]  But that's
[4484.70 --> 4484.92]  what they
[4484.92 --> 4485.24]  wanted.
[4486.30 --> 4487.24]  For those who
[4487.24 --> 4488.32]  are repentant
[4488.32 --> 4488.90]  and who
[4488.90 --> 4489.72]  seek glory
[4489.72 --> 4490.30]  and honor
[4490.30 --> 4491.38]  from God,
[4491.76 --> 4492.34]  he will
[4492.34 --> 4492.90]  give them
[4492.90 --> 4493.84]  exactly what
[4493.84 --> 4494.62]  they wanted.
[4495.06 --> 4495.50]  He will
[4495.50 --> 4496.12]  give them
[4496.12 --> 4497.14]  himself.
[4498.22 --> 4498.70]  And it
[4498.70 --> 4499.22]  says he
[4499.22 --> 4499.56]  will give
[4499.56 --> 4501.00]  them peace.
[4501.36 --> 4501.54]  Do you
[4501.54 --> 4501.76]  see that
[4501.76 --> 4502.34]  word peace?
[4502.72 --> 4503.24]  Peace is a
[4503.24 --> 4503.62]  word that
[4503.62 --> 4504.38]  talks about
[4504.38 --> 4505.60]  our relational
[4505.60 --> 4506.32]  reconciliation
[4506.32 --> 4507.18]  with God,
[4507.66 --> 4508.36]  between sinners
[4508.36 --> 4508.74]  and God.
[4508.84 --> 4509.34]  God will give
[4509.34 --> 4509.68]  us peace.
[4509.76 --> 4510.10]  He will give
[4510.10 --> 4510.70]  us a
[4510.70 --> 4511.34]  reconciled
[4511.34 --> 4511.90]  relationship
[4511.90 --> 4512.96]  with himself.
[4512.96 --> 4515.52]  Then at
[4515.52 --> 4516.00]  the end of
[4516.00 --> 4516.48]  our passage
[4516.48 --> 4517.48]  in verse
[4517.48 --> 4518.48]  11, it
[4518.48 --> 4518.94]  says, for
[4518.94 --> 4519.80]  God does
[4519.80 --> 4520.62]  not show
[4520.62 --> 4521.68]  favoritism.
[4522.72 --> 4523.14]  In other
[4523.14 --> 4523.54]  words, what
[4523.54 --> 4523.84]  Paul is
[4523.84 --> 4524.32]  saying is it
[4524.32 --> 4524.76]  doesn't matter
[4524.76 --> 4525.06]  if you're
[4525.06 --> 4526.06]  Jewish, it
[4526.06 --> 4526.56]  doesn't matter
[4526.56 --> 4527.02]  if you're a
[4527.02 --> 4527.40]  Gentile.
[4527.54 --> 4527.96]  God is going
[4527.96 --> 4528.56]  to judge you
[4528.56 --> 4529.38]  all the same
[4529.38 --> 4530.14]  way because
[4530.14 --> 4530.60]  he is
[4530.60 --> 4531.06]  impartial.
[4531.56 --> 4531.84]  And we're
[4531.84 --> 4531.94]  going to
[4531.94 --> 4532.26]  talk about
[4532.26 --> 4532.54]  that more
[4532.54 --> 4533.02]  next week.
[4537.00 --> 4537.62]  It's raining.
[4538.42 --> 4539.36]  Okay, but
[4539.36 --> 4540.36]  now, that's
[4540.36 --> 4540.80]  our passage.
[4540.90 --> 4541.20]  Now let's
[4541.20 --> 4541.56]  talk about
[4541.56 --> 4542.14]  some application.
[4542.96 --> 4543.82]  I want to
[4543.82 --> 4544.20]  end with a
[4544.20 --> 4544.52]  few points
[4544.52 --> 4545.04]  of application.
[4545.46 --> 4545.86]  The first
[4545.86 --> 4546.46]  is this.
[4548.44 --> 4549.12]  There's going
[4549.12 --> 4549.38]  to be a
[4549.38 --> 4549.62]  judgment.
[4551.10 --> 4551.92]  And it
[4551.92 --> 4552.76]  will be an
[4552.76 --> 4553.68]  individual
[4553.68 --> 4554.60]  judgment.
[4555.88 --> 4556.44]  Everyone's
[4556.44 --> 4556.74]  going to be
[4556.74 --> 4558.00]  judged fairly.
[4559.56 --> 4560.30]  So that
[4560.30 --> 4561.26]  means all
[4561.26 --> 4561.88]  of us right
[4561.88 --> 4562.50]  here now,
[4563.20 --> 4563.82]  right, every
[4563.82 --> 4564.78]  single person,
[4565.36 --> 4566.20]  including myself,
[4566.44 --> 4567.02]  including each
[4567.02 --> 4567.52]  one of you,
[4567.78 --> 4568.74]  is going to
[4568.74 --> 4569.26]  be judged
[4569.26 --> 4569.78]  one day.
[4570.82 --> 4571.62]  No one
[4571.62 --> 4572.50]  will
[4572.50 --> 4573.48]  escape
[4573.48 --> 4574.62]  the day
[4574.62 --> 4575.02]  of judgment.
[4576.46 --> 4577.14]  So as
[4577.14 --> 4577.46]  you sit
[4577.46 --> 4578.06]  here, remove
[4578.06 --> 4578.84]  everyone else
[4578.84 --> 4579.14]  from your
[4579.14 --> 4580.24]  mind right
[4580.24 --> 4580.60]  now,
[4581.46 --> 4582.68]  except
[4582.68 --> 4583.20]  yourself.
[4584.56 --> 4585.50]  You will
[4585.50 --> 4586.04]  be judged.
[4587.48 --> 4588.46]  Each person
[4588.46 --> 4589.82]  according to
[4589.82 --> 4590.46]  what he or
[4590.46 --> 4591.36]  she has
[4591.36 --> 4591.66]  done.
[4593.18 --> 4593.88]  But the
[4593.88 --> 4594.62]  good news,
[4594.80 --> 4595.22]  friends, the
[4595.22 --> 4595.70]  good news,
[4595.84 --> 4596.42]  is that if
[4596.42 --> 4597.68]  you are a
[4597.68 --> 4598.22]  Christian, if
[4598.22 --> 4598.98]  your life is
[4598.98 --> 4599.56]  hid with
[4599.56 --> 4601.70]  Christ, that
[4601.70 --> 4602.12]  we are
[4602.12 --> 4602.96]  awaiting a
[4602.96 --> 4604.78]  judgment from
[4604.78 --> 4605.36]  the very same
[4605.36 --> 4606.24]  person, Jesus
[4606.24 --> 4606.90]  Christ, who
[4606.90 --> 4607.92]  before, for
[4607.92 --> 4609.86]  our sake, laid
[4609.86 --> 4610.72]  down his life
[4610.72 --> 4611.34]  for us.
[4612.60 --> 4613.86]  He is the
[4613.86 --> 4614.48]  judge who
[4614.48 --> 4615.98]  himself put
[4615.98 --> 4616.96]  himself under
[4616.96 --> 4618.00]  God's judgment
[4618.00 --> 4619.78]  so that he
[4619.78 --> 4620.66]  could remove
[4620.66 --> 4622.22]  all condemnation
[4622.22 --> 4622.62]  for me.
[4622.72 --> 4623.86]  He took the
[4623.86 --> 4625.24]  penalty of our
[4625.24 --> 4626.66]  evil deeds
[4626.66 --> 4627.60]  on himself.
[4628.76 --> 4629.58]  He absorbed
[4629.58 --> 4630.24]  the wrath of
[4630.24 --> 4630.76]  God himself
[4630.76 --> 4631.42]  so that when
[4631.42 --> 4633.28]  we are united
[4633.28 --> 4633.88]  to Christ
[4633.88 --> 4634.48]  through faith,
[4634.78 --> 4635.20]  that we can
[4635.20 --> 4636.28]  stand before
[4636.28 --> 4636.80]  God, the
[4636.80 --> 4637.48]  face of God,
[4638.22 --> 4638.64]  in the
[4638.64 --> 4638.96]  righteousness
[4638.96 --> 4639.68]  of Christ,
[4640.38 --> 4641.04]  with the
[4641.04 --> 4641.56]  fruit of
[4641.56 --> 4642.98]  Christ credited
[4642.98 --> 4643.76]  to us.
[4644.20 --> 4644.76]  The God who
[4644.76 --> 4645.46]  judges us is
[4645.46 --> 4646.60]  the God who
[4646.60 --> 4647.36]  was judged
[4647.36 --> 4648.42]  for us.
[4650.66 --> 4651.38]  Now, you
[4651.38 --> 4651.94]  might say,
[4652.06 --> 4652.80]  though, okay,
[4652.86 --> 4653.40]  I'm a Christian,
[4653.40 --> 4654.58]  I put my
[4654.58 --> 4654.98]  faith in
[4654.98 --> 4655.52]  Christ, I'm
[4655.52 --> 4655.84]  supposed to
[4655.84 --> 4656.16]  do good
[4656.16 --> 4657.88]  works, but
[4657.88 --> 4658.68]  to be honest,
[4658.84 --> 4659.92]  my good
[4659.92 --> 4660.70]  works are
[4660.70 --> 4661.12]  kind of
[4661.12 --> 4661.48]  pathetic.
[4662.20 --> 4662.74]  My apples
[4662.74 --> 4663.34]  are not so
[4663.34 --> 4663.76]  big and
[4663.76 --> 4664.36]  red and
[4664.36 --> 4665.02]  juicy, they're
[4665.02 --> 4666.00]  kind of, you
[4666.00 --> 4666.52]  know, less
[4666.52 --> 4667.68]  shrivel-y,
[4668.34 --> 4669.38]  maybe a little
[4669.38 --> 4670.58]  green, spotchy.
[4672.52 --> 4673.70]  Yes, you are
[4673.70 --> 4673.94]  right.
[4674.48 --> 4675.10]  They are that
[4675.10 --> 4675.32]  way.
[4676.48 --> 4676.68]  Right?
[4676.76 --> 4677.20]  You know, even
[4677.20 --> 4678.32]  our best works,
[4678.68 --> 4679.58]  our best deeds
[4679.58 --> 4680.24]  that we can do,
[4680.36 --> 4681.46]  making awesome
[4681.46 --> 4682.26]  stuffy things,
[4682.26 --> 4685.40]  are always
[4685.40 --> 4686.56]  mixed with
[4686.56 --> 4687.22]  sin and
[4687.22 --> 4687.82]  selfishness,
[4688.06 --> 4688.62]  even our
[4688.62 --> 4689.20]  best works.
[4690.20 --> 4690.96]  But when
[4690.96 --> 4691.94]  God looks
[4691.94 --> 4692.82]  at us,
[4693.22 --> 4693.74]  and he
[4693.74 --> 4694.40]  looks at
[4694.40 --> 4695.10]  our works
[4695.10 --> 4695.44]  which are
[4695.44 --> 4696.10]  done in
[4696.10 --> 4696.60]  Christ,
[4697.38 --> 4697.80]  works that
[4697.80 --> 4698.60]  God prepared
[4698.60 --> 4699.36]  for us to
[4699.36 --> 4699.74]  do,
[4700.74 --> 4701.16]  you know
[4701.16 --> 4701.44]  what God
[4701.44 --> 4701.78]  does?
[4702.28 --> 4703.32]  He forgives
[4703.32 --> 4704.10]  what is sinful
[4704.10 --> 4704.66]  in them,
[4705.26 --> 4706.04]  and he
[4706.04 --> 4707.02]  recognizes his
[4707.02 --> 4707.74]  own righteousness
[4707.74 --> 4708.70]  in them.
[4708.70 --> 4711.76]  So I
[4711.76 --> 4712.32]  have a
[4712.32 --> 4714.08]  painting in
[4714.08 --> 4714.76]  my office
[4714.76 --> 4715.44]  that is very
[4715.44 --> 4716.06]  precious to
[4716.06 --> 4716.28]  me.
[4717.10 --> 4717.92]  You will not
[4717.92 --> 4718.80]  find it in
[4718.80 --> 4719.22]  the Vancouver
[4719.22 --> 4719.86]  Art Museum.
[4722.50 --> 4723.14]  Yep, there
[4723.14 --> 4723.40]  it is.
[4725.48 --> 4726.12]  And when
[4726.12 --> 4726.76]  you look at
[4726.76 --> 4727.04]  it, you
[4727.04 --> 4727.78]  can't really
[4727.78 --> 4728.66]  tell that
[4728.66 --> 4729.02]  it's a
[4729.02 --> 4729.66]  knight going
[4729.66 --> 4730.16]  to slay a
[4730.16 --> 4730.44]  dragon.
[4731.76 --> 4732.54]  You certainly
[4732.54 --> 4733.06]  couldn't tell
[4733.06 --> 4733.88]  what fairy tale
[4733.88 --> 4734.62]  it's from that
[4734.62 --> 4735.42]  my daughter and
[4735.42 --> 4735.72]  I read
[4735.72 --> 4736.06]  together.
[4737.54 --> 4738.24]  But when
[4738.24 --> 4739.40]  she wrapped
[4739.40 --> 4740.78]  this up for
[4740.78 --> 4741.32]  me as a
[4741.32 --> 4741.88]  Christmas present
[4741.88 --> 4742.44]  last year,
[4742.88 --> 4743.34]  and when I
[4743.34 --> 4743.98]  opened it,
[4744.20 --> 4744.64]  when I looked
[4744.64 --> 4745.20]  at a painting,
[4746.02 --> 4746.90]  I did not
[4746.90 --> 4747.92]  see one
[4747.92 --> 4749.08]  imperfection.
[4750.66 --> 4751.14]  Right?
[4751.28 --> 4751.78]  I thought it
[4751.78 --> 4752.30]  was perfect.
[4753.82 --> 4754.86]  It was done
[4754.86 --> 4755.38]  out of her
[4755.38 --> 4756.16]  love for me,
[4756.52 --> 4757.36]  and it was
[4757.36 --> 4758.58]  covered by
[4758.58 --> 4759.64]  my love for
[4759.64 --> 4759.90]  her.
[4760.58 --> 4760.82]  Right?
[4760.92 --> 4761.44]  And I
[4761.44 --> 4762.22]  received it,
[4762.36 --> 4762.78]  and I was so
[4762.78 --> 4763.28]  proud,
[4763.54 --> 4763.88]  I was so
[4763.88 --> 4764.30]  delighted.
[4765.72 --> 4767.40]  And I
[4767.40 --> 4767.86]  want you to
[4767.86 --> 4768.24]  keep that
[4768.24 --> 4768.66]  image in
[4768.66 --> 4768.82]  mind,
[4768.86 --> 4769.46]  because for
[4769.46 --> 4770.14]  a Christian,
[4770.60 --> 4772.00]  that is
[4772.00 --> 4772.48]  what the
[4772.48 --> 4772.76]  day of
[4772.76 --> 4773.00]  judgment
[4773.00 --> 4773.42]  will look
[4773.42 --> 4773.68]  like.
[4775.62 --> 4776.28]  It's like
[4776.28 --> 4777.58]  running up to
[4777.58 --> 4777.90]  your heavenly
[4777.90 --> 4779.28]  father and
[4779.28 --> 4779.58]  saying,
[4779.90 --> 4780.26]  look what I
[4780.26 --> 4780.74]  have done.
[4782.34 --> 4782.90]  You know,
[4783.00 --> 4784.00]  and maybe
[4784.00 --> 4784.30]  it's not that
[4784.30 --> 4784.70]  much to look
[4784.70 --> 4785.70]  at, but
[4785.70 --> 4786.04]  he will
[4786.04 --> 4787.96]  delight in
[4787.96 --> 4788.14]  it.
[4789.04 --> 4789.58]  And he
[4789.58 --> 4789.90]  will say,
[4790.02 --> 4790.78]  well done,
[4791.50 --> 4792.36]  my good and
[4792.36 --> 4793.00]  faithful servant.
[4794.44 --> 4795.20]  And then he
[4795.20 --> 4796.30]  will heap
[4796.30 --> 4797.36]  his rewards
[4797.36 --> 4799.12]  on us
[4799.12 --> 4799.50]  that we
[4799.50 --> 4800.22]  don't deserve
[4800.22 --> 4801.54]  honor and
[4801.54 --> 4803.04]  glory and
[4803.04 --> 4803.84]  immortality.
[4805.48 --> 4806.12]  He will
[4806.12 --> 4806.56]  give all
[4806.56 --> 4806.90]  that to
[4806.90 --> 4807.08]  us.
[4807.14 --> 4807.64]  That is
[4807.64 --> 4808.42]  the judgment
[4808.42 --> 4809.14]  for Christians.
[4810.54 --> 4811.18]  And that
[4811.18 --> 4812.10]  leads us to
[4812.10 --> 4812.86]  just a second
[4812.86 --> 4813.76]  quick point of
[4813.76 --> 4814.44]  application I
[4814.44 --> 4815.00]  want to share,
[4815.88 --> 4816.90]  which is that
[4816.90 --> 4818.18]  when we are
[4818.18 --> 4818.74]  seeking to
[4818.74 --> 4819.12]  love and
[4819.12 --> 4819.48]  please our
[4819.48 --> 4820.14]  heavenly father,
[4820.88 --> 4821.40]  we will
[4821.40 --> 4821.86]  live in a
[4821.86 --> 4822.40]  certain way.
[4823.28 --> 4823.62]  Okay, we
[4823.62 --> 4824.28]  will live in a
[4824.28 --> 4824.80]  certain way.
[4825.10 --> 4825.70]  This is the
[4825.70 --> 4826.36]  Christian religion
[4826.36 --> 4828.52]  that we will
[4828.52 --> 4829.32]  do good deeds.
[4830.40 --> 4830.50]  Right?
[4830.58 --> 4831.60]  So Christ died
[4831.60 --> 4832.18]  and he poured
[4832.18 --> 4832.80]  out his Holy
[4832.80 --> 4833.76]  Spirit into
[4833.76 --> 4834.42]  your hearts
[4834.42 --> 4835.26]  and he gives
[4835.26 --> 4835.82]  you supernatural
[4835.82 --> 4837.44]  life and he
[4837.44 --> 4838.24]  lives with you
[4838.24 --> 4838.92]  each and every
[4838.92 --> 4840.16]  day and he
[4840.16 --> 4840.76]  provides you
[4840.76 --> 4841.42]  grace upon
[4841.42 --> 4842.66]  grace so
[4842.66 --> 4844.42]  that you
[4844.42 --> 4844.98]  will live
[4844.98 --> 4845.76]  for him,
[4845.86 --> 4846.46]  not live
[4846.46 --> 4847.54]  for yourself.
[4849.06 --> 4849.58]  Right?
[4849.66 --> 4850.14]  And so Christ
[4850.14 --> 4850.98]  died for you
[4850.98 --> 4851.78]  so that instead
[4851.78 --> 4852.60]  of being selfish,
[4852.80 --> 4853.18]  you can be
[4853.18 --> 4853.62]  generous.
[4854.28 --> 4854.84]  And he
[4854.84 --> 4855.54]  died for you
[4855.54 --> 4856.18]  so instead
[4856.18 --> 4856.60]  of doing
[4856.60 --> 4857.20]  evil, you
[4857.20 --> 4857.54]  can do
[4857.54 --> 4857.88]  good.
[4859.10 --> 4859.68]  That you
[4859.68 --> 4859.98]  would bring
[4859.98 --> 4860.74]  him glory
[4860.74 --> 4861.26]  and honor
[4861.26 --> 4862.46]  for his
[4862.46 --> 4862.76]  name.
[4864.56 --> 4864.78]  And so
[4864.78 --> 4865.38]  friends, may
[4865.38 --> 4866.26]  it be our
[4866.26 --> 4867.52]  joy in
[4867.52 --> 4868.78]  life to
[4868.78 --> 4869.54]  bring delight
[4869.54 --> 4870.36]  to God
[4870.36 --> 4871.26]  through our
[4871.26 --> 4871.96]  good works.
[4873.70 --> 4874.38]  And he
[4874.38 --> 4875.12]  will give glory
[4875.12 --> 4875.58]  and honor
[4875.58 --> 4876.12]  and eternal
[4876.12 --> 4876.80]  life to all
[4876.80 --> 4877.36]  who repent
[4877.36 --> 4877.98]  and trust in
[4877.98 --> 4878.28]  Christ.
[4879.32 --> 4880.00]  Let's pray.
[4880.00 --> 4881.00]  God
[4881.00 --> 4881.68]  and
[4881.68 --> 4882.46]  I want
[4882.46 --> 4882.72]  to actually
[4882.72 --> 4883.00]  give you
[4883.00 --> 4883.46]  a moment
[4883.46 --> 4884.44]  to respond
[4884.44 --> 4885.04]  to God
[4885.04 --> 4885.46]  in prayer
[4885.46 --> 4886.86]  on your
[4886.86 --> 4887.12]  own.
[4887.32 --> 4887.52]  So just
[4887.52 --> 4887.76]  take a
[4887.76 --> 4887.94]  moment,
[4888.04 --> 4888.34]  come before
[4888.34 --> 4888.68]  God in
[4888.68 --> 4888.90]  prayer,
[4889.32 --> 4889.82]  respond to
[4889.82 --> 4890.08]  what you

[4910.10 --> 4910.44]  Father,

[4927.40 --> 4928.86]  praise from
[4928.86 --> 4929.16]  you.

[4931.20 --> 4932.00]  to persevere
