[1013.60 --> 1043.58]  Thank you.
[1043.58 --> 1073.56]  Thank you.
[1073.56 --> 1103.54]  Thank you.
[1103.54 --> 1133.52]  Thank you.
[1133.52 --> 1163.50]  Thank you.
[1163.52 --> 1193.50]  Thank you.
[1193.50 --> 1223.50]  Thank you.
[1223.50 --> 1253.50]  Thank you.
[1253.50 --> 1283.50] 
[1283.50 --> 1313.48]  Thank you.
[1313.50 --> 1343.50]  Thank you.
[1343.50 --> 1373.50]  Thank you.
[1373.50 --> 1403.50]  Thank you.
[1403.50 --> 1433.50]  Thank you.

[1463.50 --> 1493.50]  Thank you.
[1493.50 --> 1523.48]  Amen.
[1523.50 --> 1553.48]  Thank you.
[1553.48 --> 1583.46]  Thank you.
[1583.48 --> 1613.46]  Thank you.
[1613.48 --> 1643.46]  Thank you.
[1643.48 --> 1673.46]  Thank you.
[1673.48 --> 1703.46]  Thank you.
[1703.48 --> 1733.46]  Thank you.
[1733.48 --> 1763.46]  Thank you.
[1763.48 --> 1793.46]  Thank you.
[1793.48 --> 1823.46]  Thank you.
[1823.48 --> 1853.46]  Thank you.
[1853.48 --> 1883.46]  Thank you.
[1883.46 --> 1913.44]  Thank you.
[1913.46 --> 1943.44]  Thank you.
[1943.46 --> 1973.44]  Thank you.
[1973.44 --> 2003.44]  Thank you.
[2003.44 --> 2033.44] 
[2033.44 --> 2063.42]  Thank you.
[2063.42 --> 2093.40]  Thank you.
[2093.42 --> 2093.44] 
[2123.42 --> 2153.42]  Thank you.
[2153.42 --> 2183.42]  Thank you.
[2183.42 --> 2213.42]  Thank you.
[2213.42 --> 2243.42]  Thank you.
[2243.42 --> 2273.42]  Thank you.
[2273.42 --> 2303.42]  Thank you.
[2303.42 --> 2333.42]  Thank you.
[2333.42 --> 2363.42]  Thank you.
[2363.42 --> 2393.42]  Thank you.
[2393.42 --> 2423.42]  Thank you.
[2423.42 --> 2453.42]  Thank you.
[2453.42 --> 2483.42]  Thank you.
[2483.42 --> 2513.42]  Thank you.
[2513.42 --> 2543.42]  Thank you.
[2543.42 --> 2544.42]  Thank you.
[2573.42 --> 2603.42]  Thank you.
[2603.42 --> 2608.48]  given him and that all that God gives to his people. You know, I think that is so encouraging,
[2608.60 --> 2614.58]  it's so inspiring to me because so often, at least for me, I tend to focus on the negative,
[2614.96 --> 2622.10]  right? I worry or I grumble about this or that in my own life or, you know, the challenges we face
[2622.10 --> 2629.84]  in our church rather than being thankful for what God is doing and what he has provided.
[2629.84 --> 2637.20]  And so when our eyes are open to see the evidence of God's hand at work, we begin to thank him.
[2638.14 --> 2643.54]  The gospel creates a people of gratitude. So as we think about that, as you think about your own life,
[2644.32 --> 2650.52]  what are you grateful for this morning? I know it's not Thanksgiving yet, but still, every day we can
[2650.52 --> 2657.44]  ask, what am I thankful for? What do you see God doing in your life? What do you see God doing in
[2657.44 --> 2666.40]  our church? I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. Now, the second thing we see
[2666.40 --> 2673.92]  is the gospel also creates a people of faithfulness, okay? Not just gratitude, but also faithfulness.
[2673.92 --> 2680.92]  So look again at verse 8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. Why, Paul?
[2680.92 --> 2691.54]  Because your faith is being reported all over the world. And so Paul thanks God because it is God who
[2691.54 --> 2699.58]  has created a community of faithful Christians in the capital of Rome. And Paul's language here
[2699.58 --> 2706.00]  leaves us no doubt that this was a true, authentic Christian community. And in fact, at the very end of
[2706.00 --> 2712.66]  Romans, in chapter 16, Paul says something very similar as he kind of circles back, but he changes
[2712.66 --> 2720.56]  the word slightly. He says there of the Roman Christians in chapter 16, verse 19, everyone has
[2720.56 --> 2728.40]  heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you, right? Not that their faith is known all over
[2728.40 --> 2734.62]  the world, but that their obedience is known to all. So that I rejoice over you, Paul says.
[2735.52 --> 2741.76]  Right? So here in Rome was a community that embodied the very goal of Paul's apostleship, which was, as we
[2741.76 --> 2748.06]  saw last week in verse 5, to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for the sake of
[2748.06 --> 2754.88]  his name. So Paul gives thanks to God because the lives of these Roman Christians were different.
[2754.88 --> 2761.46]  They were being transformed by the gospel, right? What they believed changed the way of their life.
[2762.44 --> 2769.28]  And this new life was evidence to the watching world of the gospel that Christ is ruling and he is
[2769.28 --> 2777.12]  reigning, that he is living and he is active by his Holy Spirit. And these Christians needed that
[2777.12 --> 2788.46]  confidence to live in the midst of the pagan Roman Empire and to obey Jesus Christ. Because they need
[2788.46 --> 2794.66]  that confidence because then as now it was scandalous to say things like there is only one true and living
[2794.66 --> 2802.08]  God. That he alone is worthy of our worship. In ancient Rome where they worshiped all kinds of gods,
[2802.08 --> 2807.42]  where today we have all kinds of different beliefs in our pluralistic society, it is scandalous to say
[2807.42 --> 2815.82]  that. It was as scandalous then as it is now to think that hookup culture is actually dehumanizing.
[2817.76 --> 2824.98]  That's not a new thing today. It was scandalous then. It was as scandalous then as it is now to say
[2824.98 --> 2831.78]  that Jesus is Lord and to live by the teachings of Jesus and not by whatever influencer or whatever
[2831.78 --> 2835.88]  political party or whatever other group that would teach us what is good and true.
[2838.82 --> 2845.36]  And now that faith in Christ, the obedience that flows from their faith, was, Paul says,
[2845.50 --> 2852.02]  being reported all over the world. There are Christians in the capital. They are living their lives in
[2852.02 --> 2858.66]  obedience to the Lord Jesus. And notice what he doesn't say. He doesn't say what's being reported
[2858.66 --> 2864.86]  all over the world is how big their congregation is. It wasn't how many ministry programs they had.
[2865.80 --> 2871.62]  It was their faith. They had a faithful gospel witness in the capital of the Roman Empire
[2871.62 --> 2879.16]  and everyone learned about it. Their belief and their trust in God, the God who raised Jesus from the dead,
[2879.16 --> 2888.86]  was making an impact in their lives. So let me ask us, how is the gospel making an impact on your and my life?
[2889.68 --> 2894.16]  How is it making an impact on your life? How is the rule and reign of Jesus actually
[2894.16 --> 2901.58]  changing what you believe and think and aligning your heart with his word to make you more like him?
[2901.58 --> 2911.22]  So that leads Paul to pray, then doesn't it? Right? And that's the third thing we see,
[2911.76 --> 2916.46]  that the gospel creates a people of prayer. So look at verses 9 and 10.
[2917.90 --> 2924.08]  It says, God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his son, is my witness,
[2924.42 --> 2930.84]  how constantly I remember you in my prayers at all times. And I pray that now, at last, by God's will,
[2930.84 --> 2937.70]  the way may be open for me to come to you. So here, Paul remembers them before God in prayer.
[2938.10 --> 2945.04]  And he asks God, prays to God that God would work out his travel plan so that he could then go and
[2945.04 --> 2955.22]  visit them. So notice where he says here, constantly, constantly, I remember you in my prayers at all
[2955.22 --> 2961.74]  times. So constantly at all times. Okay, so this is not, hey, hey, guys, I prayed for you once.
[2962.66 --> 2970.08]  Right? This is Paul calling God himself to witness that he constantly, continually, consistently
[2970.08 --> 2977.06]  prays for the Roman Christians. And also notice that word, remember. I remember you in my prayer.
[2977.06 --> 2986.96]  He doesn't say, I pray for all of your needs in detail daily. He says, I remember you. In other
[2986.96 --> 2993.24]  words, I just bring you before God. He's a father who knows what we need before we even ask. And so
[2993.24 --> 2998.72]  I just remember you before him. And I let him take care of the details. And you know what? I'm really
[2998.72 --> 3006.32]  helped by that. Because when it comes to me as your pastor praying for you all, sometimes I know what's
[3006.32 --> 3012.22]  going on in your life. I know what to pray for. But a lot of times I don't. I don't know what to pray
[3012.22 --> 3020.14]  for in detail. But I can remember you in prayer. I can hold you up before God, knowing that he knows
[3020.14 --> 3030.76]  what you need, even if I don't. But I can lift you up in prayer. And that is such good news for all of us
[3030.76 --> 3036.62]  who want to pray for people we love and care for. We can remember them. We can merely mention them in
[3036.62 --> 3042.26]  prayer. And God takes care of the rest. And then another thing we see here about prayer
[3042.26 --> 3049.00]  is that when Paul talks about his desire to visit Rome, he prays that it would be God's will.
[3049.80 --> 3055.34]  Right? He says, I pray that now at last by God's will, the way may be open for me to come to you.
[3055.34 --> 3060.38]  You know, and it's the very same posture of prayer that we see in Jesus' own life.
[3061.66 --> 3066.84]  Right? Where God, he says, God, this is what I want, yet your will be done.
[3068.40 --> 3075.54]  He says, you know, and Paul says here, I make known to God my eager desire to visit you. I want to come.
[3076.36 --> 3079.16]  I'm praying that it's God's will that it will come about.
[3079.16 --> 3087.76]  And so as we think about our own prayer lives, when we talk to God, we are invited to make our
[3087.76 --> 3093.08]  desires known to him. Right? We can say to God, God, this is what I want. This is what I desire.
[3094.16 --> 3100.82]  And then we're also then called to yield those desires to his will, trusting in his goodness and
[3100.82 --> 3105.10]  in his wisdom on our behalf. And that's what Paul does here.
[3105.10 --> 3111.14]  So let me ask you a question here, which is, you know, by way of application,
[3111.92 --> 3114.80]  who are you praying for in our church family?
[3116.92 --> 3124.48]  What hope or plan do you have personally that you need to submit to God, to his will?
[3125.70 --> 3130.62]  Those are two things that we can learn here from Paul about what it means to be shaped by the gospel,
[3130.62 --> 3136.16]  that we just always lift up people that we care about in our church and our families to God in prayer.
[3136.50 --> 3138.26]  And we can pray that his will would be done.
[3140.18 --> 3149.06]  The fourth thing that we see is that God creates a people not only of gratitude and faithfulness and prayer,
[3149.26 --> 3150.90]  but also of mutuality.
[3151.76 --> 3152.94]  What do I mean by that?
[3153.04 --> 3154.54]  Let's look at verses 11 and 12.
[3154.54 --> 3157.90]  He says, as we continue,
[3158.08 --> 3159.34]  I long to see you.
[3160.50 --> 3160.84]  Why?
[3161.68 --> 3166.42]  So that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong, to make you strong in faith.
[3167.14 --> 3172.26]  That is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.
[3173.94 --> 3177.76]  You know, so friends, when our lives are shaped by the gospel, it creates this humility,
[3177.76 --> 3182.50]  this willingness to be interdependent with one another,
[3182.90 --> 3186.10]  to see that I have something that would benefit you,
[3186.46 --> 3189.28]  and to see that you have something that would benefit me.
[3189.72 --> 3193.34]  That you, our fellow brothers and sisters in the church,
[3193.60 --> 3197.96]  have something that you need that would be a blessing to you.
[3199.46 --> 3201.02]  And just think about this.
[3201.24 --> 3202.26]  Who's talking here?
[3202.96 --> 3204.70]  The Apostle Paul.
[3204.70 --> 3211.58]  Arguably someone who has much more that he could give to these Roman Christians.
[3211.76 --> 3212.98]  And he knows that.
[3213.10 --> 3216.74]  He has some gift that he might strengthen them by.
[3217.10 --> 3219.20]  And yet he says he needs them as well.
[3220.26 --> 3226.94]  He needs this fledgling little band of Christians in his life.
[3227.72 --> 3229.98]  He says, I can't wait to be among you.
[3230.32 --> 3233.96]  Because I want to be encouraged by your faithfulness to Jesus.
[3233.96 --> 3236.64]  I look forward to being helped by that.
[3237.00 --> 3239.00]  To being strengthened and encouraged by that.
[3239.90 --> 3242.46]  You know, and there are few things more encouraging for a Christian
[3242.46 --> 3246.34]  than to hear and see the gospel at work in other people's lives.
[3247.12 --> 3247.22]  Right?
[3247.32 --> 3249.44]  Bearing fruit in the lives of fellow believers.
[3249.76 --> 3251.20]  Who believe the same thing.
[3251.42 --> 3254.80]  And whose lives have been impacted by Jesus in the same way.
[3255.64 --> 3256.92]  We need that kind of encouragement.
[3258.28 --> 3258.40]  Right?
[3258.40 --> 3261.78]  So that's why I love sometimes when we have some of the missionaries we support.
[3261.92 --> 3262.82]  Like Todd Statham.
[3263.10 --> 3266.56]  His work at UBCO amongst the university students.
[3266.64 --> 3268.94]  And he shares what God is doing.
[3269.84 --> 3273.10]  The faith that is being, you know, cultivated there.
[3273.18 --> 3276.84]  Or we hear about from Gary Rosema and his work in the seafarers.
[3277.08 --> 3279.84]  Or we just hear the things that God is doing in the world.
[3280.54 --> 3283.12]  The faith that is bearing fruit.
[3283.22 --> 3285.66]  And we can be encouraged by that.
[3285.66 --> 3292.32]  And it's lovely to read about this happening in Paul's life.
[3292.48 --> 3294.20]  At the end of the book of Acts.
[3295.22 --> 3298.06]  Where, you know, the Acts is the story of the church.
[3298.16 --> 3299.94]  It's the story of all Paul's journeys.
[3300.12 --> 3303.92]  At the very end of Acts, we read that Paul did make it to Rome.
[3304.64 --> 3305.70]  He finally made it.
[3306.22 --> 3308.86]  And on seeing this group of Roman Christians,
[3309.84 --> 3311.36]  Paul thanked God for them.
[3311.72 --> 3313.16]  And he was encouraged by them.
[3313.16 --> 3317.52]  So here's what it says in Acts chapter 28, verse 15.
[3318.98 --> 3321.80]  So the brothers and sisters in Rome,
[3322.60 --> 3325.68]  there had heard that we were coming.
[3326.38 --> 3331.72]  They traveled as far as the forum of Appius and the three taverns to meet us.
[3332.14 --> 3336.48]  At the sight of these people, Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
[3337.44 --> 3337.90]  Right?
[3337.96 --> 3338.44]  Isn't that lovely?
[3339.34 --> 3342.14]  He was encouraged by these other brothers and sisters.
[3342.14 --> 3345.44]  So, ask the Spirit of God.
[3346.52 --> 3348.00]  Here's my encouragement to us.
[3348.76 --> 3350.88]  Ask God, who can I reach out to?
[3351.54 --> 3353.12]  Who can I send a text?
[3353.68 --> 3355.18]  Who can I encourage?
[3356.62 --> 3357.06]  Right?
[3357.12 --> 3358.46]  Think of someone in this congregation.
[3358.66 --> 3361.82]  You know, someone that you know that lives a life of faith.
[3361.98 --> 3363.28]  That's encouraging to you.
[3363.28 --> 3365.92]  Send them a message and say,
[3366.50 --> 3367.94]  Hey, I'm grateful for you.
[3368.52 --> 3370.66]  I'm encouraged by you.
[3371.24 --> 3372.90]  By your life before Jesus.
[3373.76 --> 3373.90]  Right?
[3373.94 --> 3375.96]  It's a practice that we can have of blessing people.
[3376.42 --> 3377.56]  Of encouraging one another.
[3378.66 --> 3381.60]  Because the gospel creates a people of mutuality.
[3382.60 --> 3385.50]  Then finally, the gospel creates a people of fruitfulness.
[3386.74 --> 3389.00]  Hey, the gospel creates a people of fruitfulness.
[3389.00 --> 3393.22]  So, look with me here at the final part, verses 13 to 15.
[3393.22 --> 3395.22]  Paul says,
[3395.22 --> 3396.22]  Why?
[3396.22 --> 3402.32]  I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you,
[3402.84 --> 3408.12]  but have been prevented from doing so until now, in order that I might have a harvest among you,
[3408.62 --> 3411.02]  just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
[3411.80 --> 3415.32]  I am obligated, both the Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
[3415.32 --> 3422.48]  That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
[3424.44 --> 3427.90]  Why is Paul eager to go to Rome?
[3429.82 --> 3432.84]  Because he has gospel work to do there.
[3433.16 --> 3435.78]  He wants to reap a harvest among them.
[3436.10 --> 3439.42]  He wants to preach the gospel there.
[3439.56 --> 3441.14]  See where it says in verse 15,
[3441.14 --> 3445.68]  I am eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
[3446.44 --> 3450.74]  And that phrase, preach the gospel, in Greek is just one word.
[3451.88 --> 3457.66]  It is the word gospel, which is normally for us a noun, the gospel, but it is in a verb form.
[3458.62 --> 3461.14]  And so we have to make it into a phrase, preach the gospel,
[3461.86 --> 3466.30]  but more literally it can just say, I am eager to gospelize,
[3466.82 --> 3468.20]  or whatever gospel is in a verb form.
[3468.20 --> 3470.84]  I am eager to gospel you, to gospelize you.
[3471.52 --> 3473.64]  And who is the you he is talking about?
[3474.44 --> 3475.46]  Who is he talking to?
[3476.24 --> 3478.42]  Well, I think the most obvious way to read this
[3478.42 --> 3481.60]  is that Paul is still talking to that same group of people
[3481.60 --> 3484.56]  about whom, you know, he is thanking God for,
[3484.76 --> 3487.06]  and he is praying for, and who he wants to visit.
[3488.06 --> 3493.46]  In other words, Paul wants to gospelize the believers in Rome.
[3495.08 --> 3495.90]  That's interesting.
[3495.90 --> 3501.60]  We don't usually think about preaching the gospel to believers.
[3502.56 --> 3505.86]  But listen to this quote from Pastor Tim Keller.
[3507.32 --> 3508.48]  He says this,
[3508.62 --> 3512.08]  The gospel is not the ABCs,
[3512.54 --> 3514.40]  the kind of beginning part,
[3514.94 --> 3517.92]  but the A to Z,
[3518.14 --> 3518.74]  or Z,
[3519.22 --> 3522.56]  of the Christian life.
[3522.56 --> 3526.20]  We are saved by believing the gospel,
[3526.52 --> 3531.20]  and then we are transformed in every part of our minds, hearts, and lives
[3531.20 --> 3533.72]  by believing the gospel more and more deeply
[3533.72 --> 3536.14]  as life goes on.
[3537.74 --> 3537.86]  Right?
[3537.92 --> 3539.30]  And so Paul's aim, right,
[3539.46 --> 3541.48]  back as he put it in verse 5,
[3542.00 --> 3544.70]  is to call all the Gentiles to the obedience
[3544.70 --> 3546.22]  that comes from faith.
[3546.22 --> 3548.76]  And so therefore, this makes sense.
[3549.36 --> 3553.96]  Because as important as the initial conversion is,
[3554.32 --> 3555.86]  Paul wants fruit.
[3556.34 --> 3558.80]  By which he means not just new conversions,
[3559.44 --> 3561.74]  but also an ongoing, lifelong,
[3562.22 --> 3564.48]  consistent obedience to the way of God
[3564.48 --> 3566.02]  in the lives of believers.
[3566.02 --> 3570.38]  He wants to come to strengthen them in their faith.
[3570.64 --> 3572.68]  He wants to build up these Roman Christians
[3572.68 --> 3575.76]  so that their lives would become more and more fruitful
[3575.76 --> 3578.32]  in service to the Lord Jesus.
[3579.46 --> 3579.96]  Why?
[3580.78 --> 3582.58]  Because that's what we'll witness
[3582.58 --> 3584.36]  to the name of the Lord Jesus
[3584.36 --> 3585.76]  before all the nations.
[3587.36 --> 3589.44]  And friends, what we believe,
[3589.54 --> 3591.36]  when what we believe changes our lives,
[3591.36 --> 3595.96]  when our obedience is evident to a watching world,
[3596.40 --> 3598.16]  that's when Jesus becomes believable.
[3599.16 --> 3601.62]  That's when people will see that he is worthy
[3601.62 --> 3604.02]  of our lives, worthy of our worship.
[3604.98 --> 3605.46]  And you know what?
[3605.50 --> 3606.60]  And that's what we're trying to do here
[3606.60 --> 3607.28]  every single week.
[3608.24 --> 3608.42]  Right?
[3608.54 --> 3610.38]  Every week, my goal,
[3611.44 --> 3612.40]  what are we doing?
[3612.88 --> 3615.66]  Every week, my goal is to preach the gospel
[3615.66 --> 3618.52]  to you, to gospelize you,
[3618.52 --> 3621.08]  so that the gospel would impact
[3621.08 --> 3623.70]  every area of your life.
[3624.44 --> 3625.74]  A to Z.
[3627.18 --> 3629.16]  And you know, yes,
[3629.26 --> 3630.72]  there will be non-Christians here,
[3631.34 --> 3632.94]  people who have not yet believed in Jesus.
[3633.22 --> 3633.92]  That's awesome.
[3634.38 --> 3635.30]  We welcome you,
[3635.38 --> 3636.26]  if that's you this morning.
[3636.36 --> 3638.88]  We want people who don't yet trust in Jesus
[3638.88 --> 3639.68]  to be here
[3639.68 --> 3642.18]  so that they would also come to know him.
[3643.62 --> 3644.66]  But primarily,
[3644.98 --> 3646.30]  when we preach the gospel,
[3646.66 --> 3647.72]  it's to the people of God.
[3648.52 --> 3650.32]  And every week when I preach,
[3650.58 --> 3653.48]  my prayer is that fruit will result.
[3653.90 --> 3658.02]  A harvest would be borne out from us.
[3658.54 --> 3658.68]  Right?
[3658.74 --> 3660.44]  And God gives the fruit, of course.
[3661.08 --> 3662.22]  But that's what I'm praying for.
[3662.80 --> 3664.36]  That's what I'm aiming for.
[3665.16 --> 3668.32]  Because I want more and more of this obedience of faith
[3668.32 --> 3669.30]  that Paul talks about
[3669.30 --> 3671.26]  in my life.
[3671.26 --> 3674.50]  And I want more and more of the obedience of faith
[3674.50 --> 3675.32]  in your life
[3675.32 --> 3677.26]  for the sake of his name.
[3678.30 --> 3679.40]  For his glory.
[3679.78 --> 3679.92]  Right?
[3680.08 --> 3680.86]  In Ladner,
[3681.66 --> 3682.36]  and in Canada,
[3682.54 --> 3683.12]  in our country,
[3683.22 --> 3683.96]  and around the world.
[3685.52 --> 3688.06]  And that is what Isaiah wanted to.
[3688.32 --> 3689.46]  Remember Isaiah the prophet?
[3690.16 --> 3692.36]  He preached the gospel
[3692.36 --> 3694.02]  to the people of God
[3694.02 --> 3695.20]  in the Old Testament.
[3695.20 --> 3696.96]  And I'll conclude with this.
[3697.46 --> 3699.76]  At the very end of Isaiah 61,
[3700.16 --> 3701.16]  there's this promise.
[3702.16 --> 3704.12]  That where the gospel is heard,
[3704.26 --> 3706.02]  where the gospel is preached and believed,
[3706.48 --> 3708.72]  the Lord will cause righteousness
[3708.72 --> 3711.28]  and praise to sprout up,
[3711.36 --> 3711.98]  to blossom,
[3712.72 --> 3715.02]  before the nations who are watching.
[3715.02 --> 3717.50]  So here's what Isaiah says.
[3718.32 --> 3720.52]  For as the soil makes the sprout come up,
[3721.00 --> 3723.04]  and a garden causes seeds to grow,
[3723.68 --> 3725.86]  so the sovereign Lord will make righteousness
[3725.86 --> 3727.70]  and praise spring up
[3727.70 --> 3729.68]  before all nations.
[3730.84 --> 3733.60]  That's what Paul wanted in Rome.
[3734.76 --> 3737.28]  And may it be so among us as well.
[3738.12 --> 3738.80]  So let's pray.
[3741.40 --> 3742.90]  O Lord, we praise you
[3742.90 --> 3744.92]  because you are the God who reigns.
[3745.82 --> 3746.72]  You are Lord.
[3747.82 --> 3749.80]  And you gather a people for yourself
[3749.80 --> 3751.74]  from among the nations to know you
[3751.74 --> 3754.14]  and to live by the ways of your kingdom.
[3755.02 --> 3756.00]  Lord, would you help us
[3756.00 --> 3757.84]  to be ever more shaped by your gospel.
[3758.90 --> 3760.92]  That good news of who you are,
[3761.00 --> 3761.90]  the Lord Almighty.
[3763.10 --> 3765.20]  The good news of what you are doing
[3765.20 --> 3768.14]  to redeem all things through Christ.
[3769.06 --> 3771.14]  We pray, Lord, for you to be at work
[3771.14 --> 3772.38]  in each of our lives
[3772.38 --> 3774.28]  by the power of your spirit.
[3774.28 --> 3776.24]  And we pray in Jesus' name.
[3776.62 --> 3776.88]  Amen.
[3779.36 --> 3780.62]  All right, let's all stand
[3780.62 --> 3782.74]  and let's sing a song of response.
[3782.74 --> 3783.74]  Lord.
[3790.58 --> 3791.42]  Let's sing a song of praise, Lord.
[3791.42 --> 3797.26]  Let's sing a song of și-pong și-pong și-pong și-pongi will be Lat Einaruse,
[3797.26 --> 3798.26]  Amen.
[3827.26 --> 3828.26]  Amen.
[3857.26 --> 3859.26]  Amen.
[3887.26 --> 3888.26]  Amen.
[3917.26 --> 3919.26]  Amen.
[3947.26 --> 3948.26]  Amen.
[3977.26 --> 3979.26]  Amen.
[4007.26 --> 4010.26]  Amen.
[4014.26 --> 4034.24]  So we come to a time now when we get to give an offering in response to God.
[4034.24 --> 4042.78]  You know, Ephesians reminds us that it is by grace that we have been saved through faith, and it's not from ourselves.
[4042.98 --> 4043.86]  It's a gift of God.
[4045.04 --> 4054.46]  And so this is a time in our service where we respond to that gift, that gift of grace from God, with the gift of our own tithes and offerings for his name's sake.
[4054.96 --> 4058.98]  So I invite our deacons to come forward to collect our morning offering.
[4058.98 --> 4064.78]  And the designated offering for today is Bethesda.
[4088.98 --> 4090.98]  Bethesda
[4118.98 --> 4120.98]  Bethesda
[4120.98 --> 4122.98]  Amen.
[4150.98 --> 4152.98]  Amen.
[4180.98 --> 4182.98]  Amen.
[4182.98 --> 4184.98]  Amen.
[4204.98 --> 4209.98]  Our Heavenly Father invites us to bring our needs and our requests before Him,
[4209.98 --> 4217.98]  and He delights when His children come together before Him, united in heart and in mind.
[4217.98 --> 4223.98]  So please join your hearts and minds with me as we bring the needs of the world and our church before Him,
[4223.98 --> 4226.98]  and we will also conclude with the Lord's Prayer.
[4228.98 --> 4235.98]  Heavenly Father, we come to You as weak and broken jars of clay,
[4235.98 --> 4242.98]  knowing that Your all-surpassing power and glory are displayed in our weakness.
[4242.98 --> 4247.98]  Father, we pray for our church.
[4247.98 --> 4254.98]  Lord, we especially pray for the needs of those in our congregation who are sick and are not doing well.
[4254.98 --> 4263.98]  Lord, we pray for Henny, who fell and broke her hip, and Lord, who had a successful operation just the other day.
[4263.98 --> 4267.98]  Lord, but we pray for her recovery and recuperation.
[4268.98 --> 4277.98]  And Lord, we continue to pray for Grace as she is in the Delta Hospital and as the doctors try to determine what is going on.
[4277.98 --> 4280.98]  Lord, we pray that You would be with her and heal her as well.
[4280.98 --> 4287.98]  Lord, we pray for our children, and Lord, we turn also to lift up the needs of our church and our ministries.
[4287.98 --> 4292.98]  Today, we lift up our children's ministries, Lord Kids Life, Sunday School,
[4292.98 --> 4295.98]  Cadets and GEMS that are starting up this week.
[4295.98 --> 4302.98]  We ask that You would lead and sustain and encourage, Lord, all of our Sunday School teachers and assistants,
[4302.98 --> 4306.98]  our cadets and our GEMS leaders in this good work.
[4306.98 --> 4311.98]  We pray that You would fill them with Your love for the children,
[4311.98 --> 4318.98]  and that You would give them patience and creativity and reliance on Your Holy Spirit as they point our kids to You.
[4318.98 --> 4324.98]  We pray, Lord, for the hearts of all the children who participate in these ministries.
[4324.98 --> 4331.98]  Lord, whether it's kids from our own church or from our community, may Your words be a lamp unto their feet.
[4331.98 --> 4338.98]  And Lord, in Your mercy, make their hearts alive to You, that they would know Your glory and Your grace,
[4338.98 --> 4342.98]  that they would live in You and for You all their days.
[4342.98 --> 4346.98]  Father, we pray also for other churches in our city.
[4346.98 --> 4355.98]  We ask that You would empower them by Your Spirit to faithfully proclaim Your gospel and to walk faithfully in Your ways,
[4355.98 --> 4360.98]  that they might continue to reflect the beauty of Your goodness and Your love.
[4360.98 --> 4366.98]  Lord, we pray for the local universities around us this morning.
[4366.98 --> 4368.98]  Lord, we pray for UBC.
[4368.98 --> 4371.98]  We pray for Trinity Western and others.
[4371.98 --> 4382.98]  We pray particularly for the work this morning of Todd Statham at UBCO as he begins up another semester of ministry as students are returning to campus.
[4382.98 --> 4389.98]  Lord, we pray for all of the campus ministries that work on these campuses, that You would strengthen and sustain them,
[4389.98 --> 4395.98]  and that Your gospel would be known day after day in word and in deed to university students,
[4395.98 --> 4405.98]  that believers would be built up in Christ and that You would shine the light of Your love in the hearts of also those who do not know You, drawing them to Yourself.
[4405.98 --> 4411.98]  Lord, we pray today for the ministry of Bethesda that serves people with special needs.
[4411.98 --> 4417.98]  We pray for their residential care and their day programs for all of their work that they do.
[4417.98 --> 4422.98]  We pray that You would meet all their needs for the work that You have given them to do.
[4422.98 --> 4429.98]  We pray that through their ministry that You would bless all those who participate in their programs and their families.
[4429.98 --> 4436.98]  We thank You, Lord, for our Friendship Coffeehouse ministry that also has started up again.
[4436.98 --> 4441.98]  Lord, would You make Your love known through this work to all those who come and participate,
[4441.98 --> 4447.98]  that they would know the love of Jesus and also find a place of welcome and belonging.
[4447.98 --> 4457.98]  Lord, as we lift up all these things to You, we also are reminded, Lord, that You are the God, You are the Father,
[4457.98 --> 4460.98]  who knows all that is on our hearts and all that we need.
[4460.98 --> 4468.98]  And so, Lord, we remember the people in our lives before You, the ministries of our church, the needs that we have,
[4468.98 --> 4473.98]  all of them, Lord, You are aware of and, Lord, You care about.
[4473.98 --> 4478.98]  And finally, Lord, we pray together as You taught us to pray, saying,
[4478.98 --> 4482.98]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
[4482.98 --> 4487.98]  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4487.98 --> 4496.98]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4496.98 --> 4501.98]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4501.98 --> 4508.98]  For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
[4508.98 --> 4510.98]  Let's all stand.
[4510.98 --> 4514.98]  And we will go out with God's blessing upon us.
[4514.98 --> 4516.98]  We will sing a final song.
[4516.98 --> 4519.98]  And then join us for lunch.
[4519.98 --> 4522.98]  Right outside, set up in the foyer and outside as well.
[4522.98 --> 4533.98]  To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before His glorious presence, without fault and with great joy.
[4533.98 --> 4544.98]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now, and forevermore. Amen.
[4544.98 --> 4546.98]  Thank you.
[4546.98 --> 4547.98]  Thank you.
[4547.98 --> 4548.98]  Thank you.
[4548.98 --> 4550.98]  Thank you.
[4550.98 --> 4556.98]  Thank you.
[4556.98 --> 4558.98]  Thank you.
[4558.98 --> 4562.98]  Thank you.
[4562.98 --> 4564.98]  Thank you.
[4564.98 --> 4567.38]  Praise, God, and heart for your glory.
[4569.42 --> 4574.78]  deroyable, Lord, 행 just peace and good in thee.
[4575.18 --> 4577.58]  Tell us how we pray.
[4579.02 --> 4582.14]  And in heaven's soul set free.
[4582.56 --> 4588.94]  Guide us, Lord, and use us, Lord, and lead us by today.
[4588.94 --> 4599.06]  By your praise we've been saved, come again to God
[4599.06 --> 4606.76]  Join my faith, one and one, for your glory Lord
[4606.76 --> 4614.06]  Let us peace and unity, for us now we pray
[4614.06 --> 4621.60]  And in heaven the sun set free, find us life and ease us life
[4621.60 --> 4624.26]  He has lost you
[4644.06 --> 4648.96]  Man is a place where compassion is raciだ
[4648.96 --> 4652.04]  In the heaven heaven earth
[4652.04 --> 4654.96]  And in heaven heaven heaven heaven am I
[4654.96 --> 4667.26]  Godspeed, yet in heaven heaven heaven неб
