[0.00 → 5.62] our Redeemer. My name is Ryan Ben Viet and I will be helping us in
[5.62 → 9.90] worship this morning along with Paul Kemp and the rest of the music team who
[9.90 → 15.06] will be helping us sing God's praise together. Unfortunately, Pastor Jason is
[15.06 → 20.24] sick today so we won't be hearing from Pastor Jason in his series, but it's
[20.24 → 23.82] nothing too serious. It's just a, I believe, a cold, but he has lost his voice so that
[23.82 → 28.30] makes preaching a little bit difficult. So fortunately, Pastor Walt Broker has
[28.30 → 33.42] graciously offered to step in at the last minute and bring us God's Word and
[33.42 → 38.74] he'll be preaching from John 17, I believe, in a sermon called What Jesus
[38.74 → 44.74] Wants for Us. Now, perhaps you smelled it on the way in, but we're in luck today.
[44.82 → 48.60] We're going to be having a soup and bun lunch after the service so if you can
[48.60 → 52.26] join us for that, we'd love to have you. And that's whether you're a long-time
[52.26 → 56.02] member here or a first-timer. It's not something that you have to pay into in
[56.02 → 59.52] order to get the soup. You just show up, and you have it and, Walt, of course, you're
[59.52 → 65.42] also invited to stay if you can. So with all that out of the way, I'd like
[65.42 → 69.30] everybody to please stand if you're able, and we'll hear God's call to worship.
[74.52 → 79.48] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 57, and it's a responsive one so
[79.48 → 84.20] as usual where there's a single arrow, I'll read it and if you guys could join in
[84.20 → 87.88] where you see the double arrows. So let's hear God's Word.
[88.54 → 96.02] I will sing and make melody, awake my glory, awake, O harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn.
[97.48 → 104.76] Give you thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations.
[105.60 → 111.78] For your said fat love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
[111.78 → 119.08] Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
[119.74 → 120.52] Let us pray.
[122.40 → 125.00] Heavenly Father, blessed is your holy name.
[125.82 → 130.40] From our first cry to our final breath, you, O Lord, are there.
[131.38 → 136.42] May your word we hear this morning be edifying to us and may it help bring about your kingdom.
[136.42 → 140.00] Thank you for gathering us here together to sing your glory.
[140.68 → 142.40] You alone are worthy of our praise.
[142.90 → 149.54] We ask that our worship of you this morning be made perfect through your son Jesus, our Redeemer. Amen.
[152.76 → 155.88] As God has called us to worship, he now greets us.
[156.18 → 161.62] Grace to you and peace from him who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits who are before his throne.
[161.62 → 168.00] And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[169.64 → 174.14] To him who loves us and has freed us from all our sins by his blood, made a kingdom.
[174.76 → 180.08] Priest to his God and Father, to him be the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[180.98 → 183.90] Let us take a moment now to greet one another in fellowship.
[183.90 → 213.88] Thank you.
[213.90 → 227.40] Our first song says, come people of the risen King, who delight to bring him praise.
[227.68 → 231.40] So let's bring our praise to our mighty God and rejoice.
[231.40 → 259.26] Come people of the risen King, who delight to bring him praise.
[259.26 → 267.96] Come all the two of our hearts to sing, to the Lord's heart of praise.
[268.46 → 276.26] Come the shaken shadows of him, he will lift your eyes to him.
[276.26 → 284.26] Come the saving hearts of mercy, reach to never remain.
[284.26 → 293.26] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, let every time rejoice.
[293.26 → 293.92] Rejoice, rejoice, let every time rejoice.
[294.26 → 302.26] Our heart, our voice, O church of blessing rejoice.
[302.26 → 317.18] Come those who enjoy his morning's heart, and those speaking through the night.
[317.18 → 325.12] Come those who tell our battles not, and those struggling are high.
[325.12 → 334.12] Of his word and love will never change, and his words never change.
[334.12 → 335.12] Come those who enjoy his morning's heart, and those speaking through the night.
[335.12 → 336.12] Come those who enjoy his morning's heart, and those speaking through the night.
[336.12 → 337.12] Come those who enjoy his morning's mind.
[337.12 → 338.12] Amen, the Spirit of mercy.
[338.12 → 339.12] Touch him, O Lordti, and those speaking through the night.
[339.12 → 343.12] So let him know his oftentimes reframe his information, and those speaking through the night.
[343.12 → 345.62] Phil, the Father, who greater your knowing's heart, and those speaking through the night.
[345.62 → 346.26] We're only hearing Jean and teacher say, did she end the night.
[346.26 → 348.76] How model we grow his morning's heart, and God.
[348.76 → 350.68] As faith in the day.
[350.68 → 350.88] Sometimes serve your sugar and the night.
[350.88 → 352.22] We're not sure your peers are.
[352.22 → 353.66] We're only hearing your grace shall be.
[353.66 → 358.82] Christians and peace with shame.
[358.82 → 359.74] Are there never inverting their hands, and on you?
[359.74 → 360.58] Christ of glory ES Your mother, his mother can recognize to hear him.
[360.58 → 363.78] Christ of fact, meaning the virus that he of the next piece of fire.
[363.78 → 374.66] Come, young and old, come every night, in a river of the flame.
[374.66 → 383.06] Come, Joseph, full of everything, and the wishes of His grace.
[383.52 → 391.66] Over all the world, His people sing, so to surely hear them call.
[391.66 → 400.10] How true the prize to every, our lives all in our.
[401.10 → 408.78] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[409.08 → 416.66] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[416.66 → 425.10] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[425.10 → 432.94] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[432.94 → 441.38] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[441.38 → 449.82] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[449.82 → 458.26] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[458.26 → 466.70] On high, on high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[466.70 → 475.14] On high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[475.14 → 483.58] The church of blessed rejoice.
[483.58 → 492.02] On high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[492.02 → 493.02] On high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[493.02 → 493.66] On high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[493.66 → 498.10] On high, the church of blessed rejoice.
[498.10 → 506.64] Come to Lord of all, who triumphed for the pain,
[507.16 → 515.18] who rose victorious in the sky, for those he came to sing.
[515.18 → 525.12] His glory's now his name, who died and raised on high,
[525.12 → 535.12] a tiger of life to live, and lives at death may die.
[535.12 → 544.18] Riding for above, behold his lands and side,
[544.18 → 553.18] which wounds their bliss upon, may his people in high.
[553.18 → 562.18] All angels lift the sky, and glory bear the sky,
[562.18 → 572.18] a thunder and thunder, he dies, and his service so dies.
[572.18 → 581.18] Riding for the years of glory, and the world of God.
[581.18 → 591.18] Riding for the years of glory, and the world of God.
[591.18 → 600.18] Riding for the years of glory, and the world of God.
[600.18 → 603.18] Riding for above, behold his death, and the world of God.
[603.18 → 606.18] Riding for above, behold his death, and the world of God.
[606.18 → 609.18] Riding for above, behold his death, Adams Mich.
[609.18 → 611.18] Riding for above, behold his life, and the world of God.
[611.18 → 621.18] Riding for above, behold His death, and ref struggles with them.
[621.18 → 627.18] I wish you'll never, never win
[627.96 → 631.18] Through our eternity
[631.18 → 638.84] You may be seated for our next song.
[643.84 → 645.86] The setting of Psalm 23.
[651.18 → 652.18] Amen.
[681.18 → 683.18] The setting of Psalm 23.
[683.18 → 687.18] The setting of Psalm 23.
[687.18 → 689.18] The setting of Psalm 23.
[689.18 → 693.18] The setting of Psalm 23.
[693.18 → 695.18] Is the presence of God.
[695.18 → 697.18] And in the's voice.
[697.18 → 699.18] comes through our name.
[701.18 → 703.18] The setting of Psalm 23.
[703.18 → 705.18] phone-claim does not teach.
[705.18 → 709.18] When we walk through debts of hour come we will feed all evil things.
[709.18 → 711.18] For you've is now."
[711.18 → 719.18] For you comfort in the presence of our foes.
[720.38 → 723.30] You anoint our heads with wood,
[723.80 → 726.90] midst and mercy on us now,
[727.46 → 733.18] as we dwell in the cross forevermore.
[733.18 → 736.18] We are.
[741.18 → 744.18] We are.
[748.18 → 751.18] We are.
[755.18 → 758.18] We are.
[764.18 → 767.18] Lord, you are our shepherd.
[767.18 → 771.18] We will act for another thing.
[772.18 → 777.18] For you take us to the places that are we.
[779.18 → 782.18] You lead these skies so long,
[783.18 → 786.18] and refreshing to our souls,
[786.18 → 793.18] as you guide us in the paths that make us clear.
[793.18 → 798.18] Beyond.
[798.18 → 799.18] Beyond.
[800.18 → 801.18] Beyond.
[801.18 → 802.18] Beyond.
[802.18 → 803.18] Beyond.
[803.18 → 804.18] Beyond.
[804.18 → 805.18] Beyond.
[809.18 → 812.18] Though we walk through the dust of power,
[812.18 → 815.18] we will fear no evil thing.
[815.18 → 820.18] You break our burden in the presence of our foes.
[820.18 → 823.18] You can write our heads with wood,
[823.18 → 824.18] and the mercy on us now,
[824.18 → 825.18] as we dwell in your house forevermore.
[825.18 → 826.18] Beyond.
[826.18 → 827.18] Beyond.
[827.18 → 828.18] Beyond.
[828.18 → 829.18] Beyond.
[829.18 → 839.18] 온.

[846.18 → 849.18] Beyond.
[850.18 → 851.18] Beyond.
[851.18 → 856.18] Lead on.
[860.18 → 863.18] Lead on.
[863.18 → 865.18] Lead on.
[877.18 → 884.68] At this point, the kids ages 3 through grade 5 can head off to kids' life and continue their worship in the way they do best.
[886.06 → 887.36] Please be blessed as you go.
[887.36 → 897.36] Now Jason's asked for Isaiah 35 to be saved for next week, so you can ignore what it says in your bulletin,
[897.36 → 900.36] and we're going to jump right to the confession and assurance.
[900.36 → 905.36] So with that in mind, we'll read here.
[905.36 → 912.36] In the courtroom, the accused is offered the opportunity to confess their crime to inform the jury of their guilt.
[912.36 → 917.36] Honesty may help a bit, but nonetheless, some sort of punishment awaits.
[917.36 → 924.36] But what then is the purpose for confessing our sins to an all-knowing, perfectly just God?
[924.36 → 929.36] God does not need our confessions.
[929.36 → 934.36] Indeed, he knows we're guilty before we even walk in the door.
[934.36 → 943.36] And our punishment for turning our back on him over and over, day after day, is nothing less than internal damnation.
[943.36 → 948.36] Honesty or not, his perfect justice demands nothing less.
[948.36 → 958.36] Thankfully, God's demand for justice has been satisfied, not by our confession, but by Jesus' death on the cross.
[958.36 → 968.36] No, we're not acquitted, but our punishment has been paid in full by God himself on the cross 2,000 years ago.
[968.36 → 971.36] He was condemned, so our sins could be forgiven.
[971.36 → 976.36] There is no other way to the Father but through him.
[976.36 → 979.36] But again, why do any of this?
[979.36 → 980.36] Why confess?
[980.36 → 983.36] Has God not done all of this already for us?
[983.36 → 985.36] Yes, he has.
[985.36 → 997.36] We do all of this, all of this, all of this, not just because, or not for our own sakes, but because it's a cause for celebration.
[997.36 → 1001.36] We do it because God asks us to.
[1001.36 → 1010.36] And in acknowledging our sins, we can live more fully in God's image, and we can strive to do better tomorrow.
[1010.36 → 1017.36] Sadly, we're not finished with our sinning, but thankfully, God is not finished with his mercy either.
[1017.36 → 1018.36] Let us pray.
[1018.36 → 1026.36] Heavenly Father, your ultimate sacrifice on the cross is the greatest gift to us.
[1026.36 → 1033.36] We celebrate your unconditional love for us and praise you from our innermost being.
[1033.36 → 1040.36] We thank you for conquering sin, for rising from the grave, for giving us hope, even in death.
[1040.36 → 1046.36] We have nothing to offer you this morning apart from a broken and contrite heart.
[1046.36 → 1049.36] We love you, Lord, and you love us.
[1049.36 → 1051.36] Amen.
[1051.36 → 1056.36] So let us now sing of God's amazing love for us.
[1056.36 → 1066.36] I'm forgiven, because you were forsaken.
[1066.36 → 1073.36] I'm forgiven, because you were forsaken.
[1073.36 → 1079.36] I'm accepted, you were condemned.
[1079.36 → 1094.36] I'm forgiven, because you were condemned.
[1094.36 → 1105.04] God, the Lord, the Spirit is in me, because He's God and the Lord's name.
[1107.76 → 1119.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1119.24 → 1149.22] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1149.24 → 1156.24] May your love come and be, to my Lord's name.
[1156.24 → 1164.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1164.24 → 1171.24] In all I do, I honour You.
[1171.24 → 1182.24] You are my King.
[1182.24 → 1189.24] You are my King.
[1189.24 → 1196.24] Jesus, You are my King.
[1196.24 → 1203.24] Jesus, You are my King.
[1203.24 → 1210.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1210.24 → 1218.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1218.24 → 1225.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1225.24 → 1232.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1232.24 → 1240.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1240.24 → 1247.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1247.24 → 1257.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1257.24 → 1262.24] May your love come and be, to my King who died for me.
[1262.24 → 1265.70] And of course, Pastor Broker has preached here a few times before.
[1266.24 → 1270.12] He's a retired pastor, and he's preached all over Alberta and BC.
[1270.44 → 1272.16] And, so thank you for taking my time.
[1273.42 → 1274.24] Good morning.
[1274.48 → 1277.74] It's a joy for me to be here with you, to worship with you,
[1278.34 → 1284.34] and to unfold, unwrap a portion, a precious portion of God's Word.
[1286.02 → 1288.22] I know what Pastor Jason is going through.
[1288.36 → 1289.94] I had my bout in January.
[1289.94 → 1292.10] I had to cancel two Sundays of preaching.
[1292.38 → 1297.24] And what particularly was disappointing for me and the family
[1297.24 → 1300.68] was that I had to bow out of a memorial service
[1300.68 → 1304.58] that I was asked to do for an elderly man who was my dear friend.
[1306.72 → 1311.20] To the musicians, I wonder if we could sing that song,
[1311.72 → 1313.58] Good Shepherd, after the message.
[1313.92 → 1319.18] Is that it fits better than with the song of response
[1319.18 → 1322.06] that Pastor Jason has chosen for his message.
[1323.52 → 1325.82] You know, the Apostle Paul writes to Timothy
[1325.82 → 1331.84] and he says that all Scripture is inspired, God-breathed.
[1332.34 → 1336.52] And we confess that is true for the Scriptures that we know,
[1336.60 → 1338.60] the 66 books of the Bible.
[1338.60 → 1349.24] But there are some passages that have a particular weight and beauty
[1349.24 → 1352.04] and significance for us.
[1352.04 → 1355.28] And it is one of those beautiful passages
[1355.28 → 1358.22] that I would like to read with you this morning.
[1358.22 → 1361.90] And because it's of such weightiness,
[1362.86 → 1365.76] I wonder if you'd be willing, if you can,
[1365.86 → 1368.46] to stand as I read the Scriptures.
[1368.74 → 1373.80] It is John 17, most commonly known as Jesus' high priestly prayer.
[1374.06 → 1376.36] If you are able, would you rise with me?
[1376.36 → 1388.80] After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed,
[1390.56 → 1392.58] Father, the hour has come.
[1396.08 → 1400.14] Glorify your Son that your Son may glorify you.
[1400.14 → 1403.52] For you granted him authority over all people,
[1404.46 → 1408.44] that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
[1409.34 → 1411.54] Now this is eternal life,
[1411.76 → 1414.56] that they know you, the only true God,
[1414.92 → 1417.32] and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[1418.20 → 1419.94] I have brought you glory on earth
[1419.94 → 1422.12] by finishing the work you gave me to do.
[1422.72 → 1425.74] And now, Father, glorify me in your presence
[1425.74 → 1429.90] with the glory I had with you before the world began.
[1430.14 → 1434.74] I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world.
[1435.40 → 1436.44] They were yours.
[1436.68 → 1439.68] You gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word.
[1440.24 → 1443.66] And now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
[1444.22 → 1446.50] For I gave them the word you gave me,
[1446.64 → 1448.02] and they accepted them.
[1448.84 → 1451.64] They knew with certainty that I came from you,
[1451.82 → 1453.78] and they believe that you sent me.
[1454.74 → 1455.84] I pray for them.
[1456.82 → 1458.34] I'm not praying for the world,
[1458.34 → 1461.42] but for those you have given me,
[1461.80 → 1463.20] for they are yours.
[1464.20 → 1465.82] All I have is yours,
[1466.26 → 1468.18] and all you have is mine,
[1468.64 → 1471.88] and glory has come to me through them.
[1472.56 → 1474.54] I will remain in the world no longer,
[1474.76 → 1476.56] but they are still in the world,
[1476.72 → 1478.24] and I'm coming to you.
[1478.24 → 1479.98] Holy Father,
[1480.70 → 1484.56] protect them by the power of your name,
[1485.10 → 1486.50] the name you gave me,
[1487.00 → 1489.44] so that they may be one as we are one.
[1490.16 → 1491.48] While I was with them,
[1491.74 → 1494.00] I protected them and kept them safe
[1494.00 → 1495.94] by that name you gave me.
[1496.86 → 1499.84] None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction
[1499.84 → 1502.22] so that the scripture would be fulfilled.
[1502.22 → 1505.30] I'm coming to you now,
[1505.68 → 1509.00] but I say these things while I'm still in the world,
[1509.14 → 1513.58] so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
[1514.38 → 1516.14] I have given them your word,
[1516.34 → 1517.86] and the world has hated them,
[1518.10 → 1521.48] for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.
[1522.26 → 1524.86] My prayer is not that you take them out of the world,
[1525.08 → 1527.66] but that you protect them from the evil one.
[1527.66 → 1529.92] They are not of the world,
[1530.04 → 1531.48] even as I am not of it.
[1532.30 → 1533.74] Sanctify them by the truth.
[1534.36 → 1535.84] Your word is truth.
[1536.64 → 1538.34] As you sent me into the world,
[1538.44 → 1540.04] I have sent them into the world.
[1541.14 → 1543.58] For them, I sanctify myself,
[1543.74 → 1546.38] that they too may be truly sanctified.
[1549.08 → 1550.82] My prayer is not for them alone.
[1552.38 → 1556.08] I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
[1556.08 → 1557.68] and all of them,
[1558.12 → 1559.36] that all of them may be one,
[1559.54 → 1559.78] Father,
[1559.88 → 1562.54] just as you are in me, and I am in you.
[1563.36 → 1564.62] May they also be in us,
[1564.66 → 1566.76] so that the world may believe that you sent me.
[1567.62 → 1570.12] I have given them the glory that you gave me,
[1570.56 → 1572.94] that they may be one as we are one,
[1573.12 → 1574.92] I in them and you in me,
[1575.28 → 1577.76] so that they may be brought to complete unity.
[1578.58 → 1581.20] Then the world will know that you sent me
[1581.20 → 1582.72] and have loved them,
[1583.20 → 1584.84] even as you have loved me.
[1584.84 → 1585.76] Father,
[1588.08 → 1591.02] I want those you have given me to be with me where I am
[1591.02 → 1592.54] and to see my glory,
[1592.80 → 1594.64] the glory you have given me
[1594.64 → 1597.40] because you loved me before the creation of the world.
[1598.78 → 1599.60] Righteous Father,
[1600.14 → 1601.84] though the world does not know you,
[1602.48 → 1603.42] I know you,
[1603.78 → 1605.60] and they know that you have sent me.
[1606.16 → 1607.70] I have made you known to them
[1607.70 → 1609.76] and will continue to make you known
[1609.76 → 1612.12] in order that the love you have for me
[1612.12 → 1613.70] may be in them
[1613.70 → 1616.64] and that I myself may be in them.
[1617.02 → 1617.72] Let's pray.
[1617.72 → 1625.98] We thank you for your holy word,
[1626.40 → 1627.14] O Lord God,
[1627.94 → 1630.08] and now we pray that the words of my mouth
[1630.08 → 1634.22] and the meditation of our hearts
[1634.22 → 1636.24] might be pleasing to you,
[1636.74 → 1638.40] O Lord, our rock and redeemer,
[1638.68 → 1639.96] through Christ our Lord.
[1640.48 → 1640.84] Amen.
[1641.84 → 1642.78] Please be seated.
[1642.78 → 1643.78] Amen.
[1643.78 → 1644.14] Amen.
[1648.14 → 1648.82] You know,
[1648.88 → 1651.58] if I had had a bit more time,
[1652.28 → 1654.28] I would have called this message
[1654.28 → 1655.98] Nothing More Beautiful.
[1660.56 → 1662.88] Because that's really what I want to unfold
[1662.88 → 1664.02] for you this morning.
[1664.72 → 1666.82] If we understand this prayer
[1666.82 → 1668.46] that Jesus prays for us
[1668.46 → 1671.06] and there is nothing more beautiful.
[1674.36 → 1675.04] You know,
[1675.08 → 1676.48] if I were to ask you
[1676.48 → 1678.68] what the Christian life is all about,
[1679.44 → 1682.20] I wonder how we would answer that question.
[1682.32 → 1683.12] I have a feeling
[1683.12 → 1684.78] that many believers
[1684.78 → 1686.62] would answer something like this.
[1687.80 → 1690.12] The Christian life is all about obedience,
[1690.46 → 1691.34] about duty,
[1691.56 → 1692.76] about denying yourself,
[1692.92 → 1694.32] about bearing your cross.
[1695.34 → 1696.68] And more on a daily basis
[1696.68 → 1697.52] to read scripture,
[1697.68 → 1698.22] to pray,
[1698.46 → 1699.30] if you have children,
[1699.46 → 1700.82] send them to Christian school,
[1700.96 → 1702.16] at least in our tradition.
[1703.28 → 1703.48] And
[1703.48 → 1706.14] when we think of the Christian life,
[1706.22 → 1707.96] we think of the things
[1707.96 → 1709.26] that we owe God.
[1716.46 → 1718.44] And the point that I want to make this morning,
[1718.58 → 1720.88] if we think of the Christian life
[1720.88 → 1721.92] in those terms
[1721.92 → 1722.88] at the outset,
[1723.26 → 1725.04] then we have it
[1725.04 → 1726.46] all wrong.
[1728.46 → 1730.52] this morning,
[1730.52 → 1731.58] I want us to discover
[1731.58 → 1733.50] what Jesus thinks
[1733.50 → 1735.54] of your life and mine.
[1736.42 → 1737.92] And what is fascinating
[1737.92 → 1739.50] when Jesus thinks
[1739.50 → 1740.58] of our lives
[1740.58 → 1742.30] in discipleship to him,
[1742.84 → 1743.76] he doesn't,
[1743.96 → 1744.44] first,
[1744.48 → 1745.34] think of the things
[1745.34 → 1746.42] that we owe him.
[1746.42 → 1751.12] notice John 17,
[1751.24 → 1753.16] verse 20.
[1753.70 → 1754.62] Can we have that?
[1757.00 → 1757.40] Jesus,
[1757.62 → 1758.90] I call this the focal text
[1758.90 → 1760.06] for my message this morning.
[1760.26 → 1760.70] Jesus says,
[1760.88 → 1762.36] I pray for these followers,
[1762.56 → 1763.62] but I'm also praying
[1763.62 → 1764.96] for all those
[1764.96 → 1766.66] who will believe in me
[1766.66 → 1768.12] because of their teaching.
[1768.12 → 1770.32] this part,
[1771.40 → 1773.64] this verse is from John 17,
[1773.80 → 1774.96] the high priestly prayer.
[1775.12 → 1776.46] Jesus is praying this
[1776.46 → 1777.30] with his disciples
[1777.30 → 1778.28] in the upper room.
[1778.68 → 1780.76] He was only a mere hour away
[1780.76 → 1781.76] from his arrest
[1781.76 → 1782.94] and a day away
[1782.94 → 1784.26] from his crucifixion.
[1785.22 → 1785.94] And here,
[1786.08 → 1787.48] he pours out his heart
[1787.48 → 1788.76] to the Father
[1788.76 → 1789.62] in the presence
[1789.62 → 1790.12] of his disciples.
[1791.24 → 1792.50] And as you can imagine,
[1792.94 → 1794.32] he talks about
[1794.32 → 1795.74] the things that are
[1795.74 → 1797.98] most urgent.
[1798.44 → 1799.32] Or the way,
[1799.40 → 1800.38] what I like to put it,
[1800.44 → 1801.78] is things that are
[1801.78 → 1802.86] most beautiful.
[1804.96 → 1806.12] And so Jesus prays
[1806.12 → 1806.98] for his disciples
[1806.98 → 1808.00] and he asks the Father,
[1808.12 → 1808.36] Father,
[1808.62 → 1810.64] I pray that these followers
[1810.64 → 1814.56] who will believe in me
[1814.56 → 1816.94] because of my disciples
[1816.94 → 1818.12] who are here now,
[1819.18 → 1820.28] that they may have
[1820.28 → 1821.54] what they have.
[1822.56 → 1823.30] And so if,
[1823.30 → 1823.58] if,
[1824.32 → 1825.54] if you are a believer,
[1825.78 → 1827.06] if you are a Christ follower,
[1827.28 → 1827.46] then,
[1827.54 → 1828.42] then know that
[1828.42 → 1829.94] 2,000 years ago,
[1830.54 → 1832.66] Jesus remembered us
[1832.66 → 1833.66] in his prayer.
[1835.94 → 1837.20] And as he's thinking
[1837.20 → 1838.00] about us,
[1839.34 → 1840.50] he's,
[1840.50 → 1841.88] he's asking the Father
[1841.88 → 1842.92] of the most beautiful,
[1843.10 → 1844.40] most urgent things
[1844.40 → 1846.36] for our lives today.
[1847.60 → 1848.70] And so this morning,
[1848.80 → 1849.74] I want to offer
[1849.74 → 1850.66] two principles.
[1851.36 → 1852.68] And I want to use
[1852.68 → 1853.70] these two principles
[1853.70 → 1854.68] as bookends
[1854.68 → 1855.54] to my message.
[1855.96 → 1857.08] I want to start
[1857.08 → 1859.80] with one principle
[1859.80 → 1861.04] that unfold
[1861.04 → 1862.02] that principle
[1862.02 → 1864.62] through what Jesus
[1864.62 → 1865.74] prays for us
[1865.74 → 1866.72] in John 17.
[1867.04 → 1868.50] And then I want to end
[1868.50 → 1870.38] with a second principle
[1870.38 → 1872.00] and point out
[1872.00 → 1872.62] that truly
[1872.62 → 1873.54] there is nothing
[1873.54 → 1874.28] more beautiful.
[1875.04 → 1876.20] The first principle
[1876.20 → 1877.08] is this.
[1877.08 → 1880.24] before we can give
[1880.24 → 1881.34] what Jesus wants
[1881.34 → 1882.50] from us,
[1882.50 → 1884.30] we must embrace
[1884.30 → 1885.22] what Jesus
[1885.22 → 1887.40] wants for us.
[1888.14 → 1889.62] Before we can give
[1889.62 → 1890.18] Jesus
[1890.18 → 1891.32] what he wants
[1891.32 → 1892.10] from us,
[1892.36 → 1893.92] we have to embrace
[1893.92 → 1894.90] what he wants
[1894.90 → 1895.46] for us.
[1895.54 → 1896.84] And so the question is,
[1897.64 → 1898.96] what does Jesus
[1898.96 → 1900.60] want for us?
[1900.60 → 1903.72] and John 17
[1903.72 → 1905.18] unwraps these,
[1905.40 → 1906.66] the things that he wants
[1906.66 → 1906.96] for us,
[1907.04 → 1907.90] I'm going to call
[1907.90 → 1909.18] life truths.
[1909.88 → 1910.76] And I'm going to
[1910.76 → 1911.50] very briefly
[1911.50 → 1912.62] unwrap for you
[1912.62 → 1914.18] seven that he mentions
[1914.18 → 1915.62] in this chapter.
[1915.62 → 1920.44] And Jesus says
[1920.44 → 1921.94] at the outset,
[1922.88 → 1924.24] he says in verse 6,
[1924.32 → 1924.66] Father,
[1924.94 → 1926.64] they belong to you.
[1927.60 → 1928.42] He is praying
[1928.42 → 1929.32] for those of us
[1929.32 → 1930.56] who through faith
[1930.56 → 1932.34] belong to the Father.
[1933.06 → 1933.86] We who love
[1933.86 → 1935.04] the High Blood Catechism
[1935.04 → 1936.20] know Lord's Day One,
[1936.34 → 1936.60] you know,
[1936.76 → 1937.88] what is our only
[1937.88 → 1938.88] comfort in life
[1938.88 → 1939.26] and death.
[1939.40 → 1940.18] And the answer,
[1940.44 → 1941.38] the crisp answer
[1941.38 → 1942.50] is that we belong.
[1944.14 → 1945.28] We belong.
[1946.32 → 1947.58] Heart and soul
[1947.58 → 1948.24] and life
[1948.24 → 1948.84] and in death
[1948.84 → 1949.64] and good times
[1949.64 → 1950.54] and bad times,
[1950.68 → 1952.68] we belong to him.
[1954.14 → 1955.74] And because we belong
[1955.74 → 1956.64] to Christ,
[1957.34 → 1958.96] we belong to the Father,
[1959.96 → 1961.42] he wants the very best
[1961.42 → 1961.96] for us.
[1962.02 → 1962.98] Well, what is that?
[1963.94 → 1964.84] Well, first,
[1965.10 → 1966.26] the first life truth
[1966.26 → 1967.46] that Jesus wants us
[1967.46 → 1968.32] to embrace
[1968.32 → 1970.26] is that we might have
[1970.26 → 1971.04] the assurance
[1971.04 → 1972.50] of salvation.
[1973.94 → 1974.84] Jesus prays
[1974.84 → 1975.72] that deep down
[1975.72 → 1978.96] we may have
[1978.96 → 1979.80] that conviction
[1979.80 → 1983.74] that deep down
[1983.74 → 1986.36] insurance
[1986.36 → 1987.36] that you and me,
[1987.44 → 1989.08] that we are his children.
[1989.08 → 1992.72] and if you,
[1992.86 → 1994.28] if you don't have that,
[1995.00 → 1996.12] then you ought to pray
[1996.12 → 1996.56] for that.
[1996.68 → 1997.64] I, you know,
[1997.76 → 1999.46] I closed out my
[1999.46 → 2001.08] vocational ministry
[2001.08 → 2001.78] at Elam
[2001.78 → 2003.40] and I loved my ministry
[2003.40 → 2003.84] there
[2003.84 → 2006.34] and Elam Village
[2006.34 → 2006.92] in Surrey
[2006.92 → 2008.32] and it,
[2008.82 → 2011.70] and occasionally
[2011.70 → 2013.40] I would meet
[2013.40 → 2014.58] an elderly person
[2014.58 → 2016.44] who,
[2016.44 → 2016.76] who,
[2016.76 → 2017.92] who,
[2017.92 → 2019.14] who would have gone
[2019.14 → 2019.90] to church
[2019.90 → 2020.92] all their lives
[2020.92 → 2021.44] and yet who,
[2021.80 → 2023.74] who wasn't sure
[2023.74 → 2026.46] about their relationship
[2026.46 → 2027.24] with Christ.
[2027.38 → 2027.66] It,
[2027.66 → 2027.78] it,
[2027.78 → 2029.30] it puzzles me.
[2029.82 → 2031.04] But this is something
[2031.04 → 2031.36] that,
[2031.50 → 2032.76] that Christ wants you
[2032.76 → 2033.46] to have.
[2033.66 → 2034.66] Notice what he says
[2034.66 → 2035.80] in verse 3.
[2035.80 → 2036.58] This is the way
[2036.58 → 2037.32] to eternal life,
[2037.42 → 2037.94] to know you,
[2038.00 → 2038.86] the only true God
[2038.86 → 2039.92] and Jesus Christ
[2039.92 → 2041.50] whom you have sent.
[2041.78 → 2042.74] Notice the word know.
[2044.50 → 2044.76] It's,
[2044.76 → 2045.46] it's not that I,
[2045.46 → 2046.74] I hope that I'm a Christian
[2046.74 → 2047.18] or,
[2047.36 → 2048.06] or I,
[2048.24 → 2049.70] I'd like to be.
[2050.70 → 2051.60] Jesus prays,
[2051.66 → 2051.96] Father,
[2052.08 → 2053.16] may they know.
[2053.72 → 2054.72] And the import of,
[2054.84 → 2056.14] the importance of this word
[2056.14 → 2056.52] is that,
[2056.60 → 2056.96] that we,
[2057.28 → 2057.64] we,
[2057.74 → 2058.94] we embrace this.
[2059.02 → 2059.98] That becomes part
[2059.98 → 2061.32] of our core identity.
[2062.86 → 2063.84] Notice the reason
[2063.84 → 2065.56] why John wrote his letter.
[2065.80 → 2066.52] uh,
[2066.52 → 2067.32] in his gospel.
[2067.58 → 2069.18] He says in 1st John 5,
[2069.22 → 2069.78] 13,
[2070.46 → 2072.66] my purpose in writing
[2072.66 → 2073.54] is simply this,
[2074.38 → 2075.44] that you who believe
[2075.44 → 2076.22] in God's son
[2076.22 → 2077.34] will know beyond
[2077.34 → 2078.66] the shadow of a doubt
[2078.66 → 2080.32] that you have eternal life,
[2080.64 → 2081.32] the reality,
[2081.88 → 2082.80] and not the illusion.
[2082.96 → 2084.30] That's how Eugene Peterson,
[2084.76 → 2085.10] uh,
[2086.10 → 2086.40] uh,
[2086.40 → 2088.12] paraphrases this verse
[2088.12 → 2090.54] in the letter of John.
[2091.34 → 2092.24] So my question is,
[2092.32 → 2093.58] do you have this assurance?
[2094.18 → 2095.76] Do you know that you have
[2095.76 → 2096.44] eternal life?
[2096.52 → 2097.36] This is something
[2097.36 → 2098.94] that Jesus prays,
[2098.98 → 2099.50] the Father,
[2099.62 → 2100.58] that you would have.
[2100.94 → 2101.32] Secondly,
[2103.38 → 2104.38] Jesus prays
[2104.38 → 2106.00] that we might experience
[2106.00 → 2107.00] God's love
[2107.00 → 2108.18] intimately.
[2109.26 → 2110.28] Can we have that?
[2111.86 → 2113.30] Jesus prays to his Father
[2113.30 → 2114.52] for us
[2114.52 → 2115.92] as his followers
[2115.92 → 2116.84] and that we would
[2116.84 → 2118.46] experience his love.
[2118.56 → 2118.96] And I just,
[2119.16 → 2119.36] you know,
[2119.40 → 2120.20] I have a head knowledge,
[2120.32 → 2121.06] not some theological
[2121.06 → 2121.72] understanding,
[2121.72 → 2122.42] but that we would
[2122.42 → 2123.36] experience it.
[2123.44 → 2123.68] Notice,
[2124.12 → 2125.10] verse 26.
[2125.82 → 2126.06] It says,
[2126.16 → 2126.38] Father,
[2126.48 → 2127.74] I made you known to them
[2127.74 → 2128.90] and I will continue
[2128.90 → 2129.70] to do so
[2129.70 → 2131.60] in order that the love
[2131.60 → 2133.12] you have for me
[2133.12 → 2134.82] may be in them.
[2136.34 → 2137.34] If you've been a Christian
[2137.34 → 2137.98] for a long time,
[2138.02 → 2139.02] I'm sure you've given this
[2139.02 → 2139.58] some thought,
[2139.66 → 2140.42] the thought about,
[2140.80 → 2141.24] about the
[2141.32 → 2142.00] the incredible
[2142.00 → 2143.32] divine love
[2143.32 → 2144.18] that is found
[2144.18 → 2145.72] between God the Father
[2145.72 → 2147.14] and God the Holy Spirit
[2147.14 → 2148.24] and God the Son.
[2149.06 → 2150.04] There's a mystery
[2150.04 → 2150.84] to that love
[2150.84 → 2151.80] that we really
[2151.80 → 2152.72] cannot grasp
[2152.72 → 2154.06] in our human relationship.
[2155.58 → 2156.14] God's love
[2156.14 → 2156.94] for his Son
[2156.94 → 2158.10] is unsullied
[2158.10 → 2159.06] by conflict
[2159.06 → 2160.08] or misunderstanding
[2160.08 → 2162.12] because the Father
[2162.12 → 2163.06] and the Son
[2163.06 → 2163.78] and the Spirit
[2163.78 → 2164.92] are perfectly one.
[2165.98 → 2167.00] The Father's love
[2167.00 → 2167.62] for his Son
[2167.62 → 2168.50] is unconditioned,
[2168.56 → 2168.98] unsullied.
[2169.06 → 2170.28] The Father has never said,
[2170.74 → 2170.98] Son,
[2171.10 → 2171.98] if you do this
[2171.98 → 2173.08] then I will love you.
[2174.72 → 2175.66] And he's never said,
[2175.82 → 2176.98] I will love you
[2176.98 → 2177.62] until death
[2177.62 → 2178.70] because the Father
[2178.70 → 2179.62] loved his Son
[2179.62 → 2180.42] through death
[2180.42 → 2182.72] by bringing him
[2182.72 → 2183.62] back to life.
[2183.84 → 2184.32] The love
[2184.32 → 2185.24] which the Father
[2185.24 → 2185.86] and the Son
[2185.86 → 2187.22] share is perfect,
[2187.50 → 2188.72] is unconditioned,
[2188.78 → 2189.36] is everlasting.
[2190.24 → 2191.36] And Jesus prays,
[2191.44 → 2192.60] may the love
[2192.60 → 2193.92] that you and I share,
[2196.14 → 2197.52] may those who believe
[2197.52 → 2198.18] in me
[2198.18 → 2200.76] also experience.
[2204.06 → 2204.58] You know,
[2204.64 → 2205.22] Grace and me,
[2205.32 → 2206.38] we have two sons.
[2206.38 → 2208.34] they are men now.
[2209.34 → 2210.98] And it's been very important
[2210.98 → 2211.74] for me
[2211.74 → 2215.58] that they are confident
[2215.58 → 2217.48] in our relationship,
[2218.54 → 2219.68] that we have
[2219.68 → 2222.56] at least an understanding
[2222.56 → 2224.18] that they are deeply loved.
[2224.32 → 2225.92] We don't always agree on things,
[2226.00 → 2226.74] but that's okay.
[2226.84 → 2227.72] But they know
[2227.72 → 2229.72] that when it comes to acceptance
[2229.72 → 2230.48] and love,
[2230.92 → 2232.32] that I embrace them.
[2232.32 → 2234.12] And it would hurt me
[2234.12 → 2235.30] terribly deeply
[2235.30 → 2236.98] if they said,
[2237.52 → 2239.44] if they communicated somehow
[2239.44 → 2239.94] and said,
[2240.04 → 2240.20] Dad,
[2240.30 → 2241.68] I don't think,
[2242.20 → 2242.92] I don't think
[2242.92 → 2244.22] I'm good enough for you.
[2246.10 → 2246.96] And you know,
[2247.04 → 2247.94] more passionate
[2247.94 → 2249.86] than any parental love
[2249.86 → 2250.90] for their children
[2250.90 → 2254.12] is the way that God
[2254.12 → 2255.82] loves us
[2255.82 → 2257.74] with the same love
[2257.74 → 2258.54] that the Father
[2258.54 → 2259.84] and the Son shared.
[2259.84 → 2262.30] And my question,
[2262.48 → 2262.66] therefore,
[2262.84 → 2263.70] to you is,
[2263.86 → 2264.60] is not whether
[2264.60 → 2265.60] you understand it.
[2265.64 → 2266.42] I don't think any of us
[2266.42 → 2267.06] can understand
[2267.06 → 2268.24] the depth of that kind of love.
[2268.30 → 2269.64] But have you experienced
[2269.64 → 2270.80] the love of God?
[2273.14 → 2274.26] Maybe your relationship
[2274.26 → 2274.88] with Christ
[2274.88 → 2275.72] has cooled down.
[2276.18 → 2277.22] And if that is the case,
[2277.30 → 2278.10] then we ought to pray
[2278.10 → 2278.76] that we might
[2278.76 → 2279.88] re-experience
[2279.88 → 2280.78] that intimacy,
[2280.98 → 2281.54] that beauty
[2281.54 → 2282.94] of the divine love
[2282.94 → 2284.72] that Jesus prays
[2284.72 → 2285.42] that you and I
[2285.42 → 2286.28] would have.
[2286.28 → 2289.84] third,
[2290.28 → 2291.48] Jesus prays
[2291.48 → 2292.86] that we might know
[2292.86 → 2294.18] Christ's joy
[2294.18 → 2295.60] unconditionally,
[2296.14 → 2297.38] continually.
[2298.30 → 2299.04] Can we have number?
[2300.12 → 2301.62] He says in verse 13,
[2302.12 → 2302.34] he says,
[2302.42 → 2302.56] Father,
[2302.68 → 2303.70] I pray these things
[2303.70 → 2304.64] while I am still
[2304.64 → 2305.28] in the world
[2305.28 → 2306.46] so that they may have
[2306.46 → 2307.90] the same joy
[2307.90 → 2309.62] that I have.
[2309.62 → 2312.66] The New International
[2312.66 → 2313.46] Version reads
[2313.46 → 2314.22] that they might have
[2314.22 → 2315.26] the full measure
[2315.26 → 2316.42] of my joy.
[2317.46 → 2318.86] Jesus asked the Father
[2318.86 → 2320.38] that we might experience
[2320.38 → 2321.66] the fullness
[2321.66 → 2322.92] of the joy
[2322.92 → 2323.78] that comes
[2323.78 → 2324.88] through faith
[2324.88 → 2326.16] in knowing Christ.
[2328.22 → 2329.46] What does that mean?
[2332.26 → 2333.26] You might say,
[2333.38 → 2333.50] well,
[2333.58 → 2335.42] if I already know
[2335.42 → 2336.36] the love of God,
[2336.36 → 2338.36] then don't I experience
[2338.36 → 2339.52] his joy as well?
[2339.52 → 2340.74] And the answer is yes,
[2341.18 → 2342.94] as long as things
[2342.94 → 2344.54] are going well in life.
[2345.04 → 2346.70] But what happens
[2346.70 → 2349.46] when life goes south?
[2350.34 → 2353.40] You get a medical test return
[2353.40 → 2355.42] that is horrible news.
[2355.86 → 2357.28] Or you have a child,
[2357.48 → 2358.62] maybe a grandchild,
[2358.74 → 2360.08] that's fallen off the wagon.
[2361.10 → 2363.44] Or somebody hurts you.
[2363.44 → 2365.10] Or, you know,
[2365.24 → 2366.88] you hurt somebody else.
[2367.22 → 2368.88] Intentionally or unintentionally,
[2368.88 → 2369.60] we get hurt
[2369.60 → 2370.94] and we hurt other people.
[2371.56 → 2372.64] What happens then?
[2373.30 → 2374.56] We may still affirm
[2374.56 → 2375.40] the love of God,
[2375.50 → 2376.30] but our joy
[2376.30 → 2378.32] will be challenged.
[2379.62 → 2380.62] And what Jesus here
[2380.62 → 2381.34] prays for
[2381.34 → 2382.60] is that when we go
[2382.60 → 2384.10] through those hard times,
[2384.10 → 2386.90] that we will not lose
[2386.90 → 2387.94] the joy of knowing
[2387.94 → 2389.60] that we still belong
[2389.60 → 2390.42] to the Father
[2390.42 → 2392.16] and that he is still
[2392.16 → 2392.80] with us
[2392.80 → 2394.56] even in the hard times
[2394.56 → 2395.22] of life.
[2396.56 → 2397.28] I mean,
[2397.32 → 2398.06] here's a scenario.
[2398.26 → 2399.26] Jesus knows
[2399.26 → 2400.00] that he's only
[2400.00 → 2401.24] hours away
[2401.24 → 2402.42] from his own
[2402.42 → 2403.64] earthly demise.
[2404.84 → 2406.14] And yet he says,
[2406.26 → 2406.90] he prays,
[2406.96 → 2407.18] Father,
[2407.28 → 2407.92] I'm secure
[2407.92 → 2409.94] in my joy with you.
[2410.16 → 2411.32] In the words of
[2411.32 → 2413.20] Hebrews 12,
[2413.98 → 2414.86] it says that
[2414.86 → 2417.70] Jesus endured
[2417.70 → 2419.38] for the joy
[2419.38 → 2420.10] before him,
[2420.32 → 2421.12] Jesus endured
[2421.12 → 2421.84] the cross.
[2423.06 → 2424.28] But for his disciples,
[2424.38 → 2425.10] it would be different.
[2426.02 → 2427.14] Their faith
[2427.14 → 2428.58] was really
[2428.58 → 2429.74] just emerging.
[2430.90 → 2431.54] They would see
[2431.54 → 2432.68] Jesus being arrested,
[2433.56 → 2434.92] abused in all kinds
[2434.92 → 2435.46] of ways
[2435.46 → 2436.36] and ultimately
[2436.36 → 2437.28] crucified.
[2438.08 → 2439.38] And Jesus knows
[2439.38 → 2439.64] this.
[2439.70 → 2439.92] He says,
[2439.92 → 2440.34] Father,
[2440.54 → 2441.30] in the hours
[2441.30 → 2442.28] especially ahead,
[2442.38 → 2443.14] may they know
[2443.14 → 2445.58] the joy
[2445.58 → 2446.54] that they can still
[2446.54 → 2447.66] have even though
[2447.66 → 2447.98] they're going
[2447.98 → 2449.14] through the hard times.
[2449.60 → 2450.42] And by extension,
[2450.68 → 2451.24] he says,
[2451.90 → 2452.32] Father,
[2452.78 → 2454.08] when my disciples
[2454.08 → 2455.84] who come long
[2455.84 → 2456.64] after them
[2456.64 → 2457.72] go through similar
[2457.72 → 2458.86] tough experience
[2458.86 → 2459.50] in life,
[2460.12 → 2461.14] may they know
[2461.14 → 2461.80] the joy
[2461.80 → 2463.14] that you and I
[2463.14 → 2464.08] have and that
[2464.08 → 2465.18] I want my
[2465.18 → 2466.22] disciples to have.
[2469.04 → 2469.80] And so,
[2469.94 → 2471.10] my question to you
[2471.10 → 2471.76] here is,
[2471.96 → 2472.34] do you know
[2472.34 → 2472.96] this joy
[2472.96 → 2473.64] that is deeper
[2473.64 → 2474.74] than our circumstances,
[2475.22 → 2476.08] that is bigger
[2476.08 → 2476.84] than happiness
[2476.84 → 2478.56] because it is rooted
[2478.56 → 2480.10] not in our circumstances
[2480.10 → 2481.52] and whatever news
[2481.52 → 2482.54] we may get,
[2482.66 → 2483.30] good or bad,
[2483.44 → 2484.48] but it is vested
[2484.48 → 2485.42] in the very promise
[2485.42 → 2485.82] of God
[2485.82 → 2486.80] that he'll be with us
[2486.80 → 2487.86] and never leave us.
[2489.84 → 2490.86] Jesus prays
[2490.86 → 2491.30] that you might
[2491.30 → 2492.16] know this joy.
[2494.18 → 2495.48] The fourth life truth
[2495.48 → 2496.36] Jesus wants us
[2496.36 → 2497.00] to embrace
[2497.00 → 2497.98] is that we might
[2497.98 → 2499.78] engage our mission
[2499.78 → 2500.72] in the world.
[2501.76 → 2502.92] Notice what he says
[2502.92 → 2504.06] in verse 18.
[2504.48 → 2504.98] This is again
[2504.98 → 2506.02] from Eugene Peterson
[2506.02 → 2506.70] in the message.
[2507.40 → 2508.44] In the same way
[2508.44 → 2509.60] that you gave me
[2509.60 → 2510.80] a mission in the world,
[2511.30 → 2512.58] I give them
[2512.58 → 2513.58] a mission in the world.
[2514.24 → 2515.12] So he's praying
[2515.12 → 2516.52] for you and me,
[2517.26 → 2517.56] you know,
[2517.66 → 2518.88] centuries ahead of time
[2518.88 → 2519.14] said,
[2519.22 → 2519.44] Father,
[2519.58 → 2520.42] may those who believe
[2520.42 → 2520.64] in me,
[2520.70 → 2521.52] may they know
[2521.52 → 2523.36] that they exist
[2523.36 → 2524.40] for a purpose,
[2525.08 → 2526.80] that life has meaning,
[2526.80 → 2528.12] and that they may
[2528.12 → 2529.28] understand their life
[2529.28 → 2530.76] purpose because
[2530.76 → 2531.46] they have this
[2531.46 → 2532.60] relationship with me
[2532.60 → 2534.38] that defines who they are
[2534.38 → 2535.20] and what they are
[2535.20 → 2536.24] supposed to do.
[2538.32 → 2539.20] And when you think
[2539.20 → 2540.30] about the order
[2540.30 → 2540.82] of the things
[2540.82 → 2541.58] that he prays for,
[2541.64 → 2542.62] it kind of makes sense.
[2542.76 → 2543.12] He says,
[2543.18 → 2543.42] Father,
[2543.50 → 2544.22] may they first
[2544.22 → 2544.82] be secure
[2544.82 → 2546.12] in our relationship,
[2546.78 → 2547.92] that they may have
[2547.92 → 2548.92] the love and the joy
[2548.92 → 2550.56] that we share,
[2550.56 → 2551.78] and then when they
[2551.78 → 2552.26] have that,
[2552.50 → 2554.58] may they fulfill
[2554.58 → 2555.26] the mission
[2555.26 → 2557.24] that I give them.
[2561.02 → 2561.98] And so,
[2562.64 → 2563.44] our mission
[2563.44 → 2565.56] is not to raise
[2565.56 → 2566.26] a family.
[2567.62 → 2568.70] Our mission
[2568.70 → 2570.38] in the world
[2570.38 → 2571.84] is to love God
[2571.84 → 2573.78] through our family
[2573.78 → 2575.90] and to pass on
[2575.90 → 2576.58] God's love
[2576.58 → 2577.74] to the next generation.
[2578.04 → 2579.20] Our mission
[2579.20 → 2580.08] in life
[2580.08 → 2581.24] is not to build
[2581.24 → 2582.18] a great career.
[2582.60 → 2583.36] Our mission
[2583.36 → 2584.02] in life
[2584.02 → 2585.06] is to honour God
[2585.06 → 2585.86] as we are
[2585.86 → 2587.02] building that career.
[2588.54 → 2589.52] Our mission
[2589.52 → 2590.02] in life
[2590.02 → 2590.72] is not to
[2590.72 → 2592.50] provide for retirement
[2592.50 → 2593.64] when our employment
[2593.64 → 2595.04] days are over.
[2598.86 → 2599.82] Our mission
[2599.82 → 2600.46] in life
[2600.46 → 2601.12] is to
[2601.12 → 2603.08] follow Christ
[2603.08 → 2604.52] as we seek
[2604.52 → 2605.12] to provide
[2605.12 → 2606.62] for our needs
[2606.62 → 2607.46] when our employment
[2607.46 → 2608.44] days are over.
[2608.44 → 2610.20] the mission
[2610.20 → 2611.12] Jesus prays
[2611.12 → 2611.38] about
[2611.38 → 2612.14] is not part
[2612.14 → 2612.90] of our lives.
[2613.38 → 2613.98] The mission
[2613.98 → 2615.10] Jesus prays
[2615.10 → 2615.56] for us
[2615.56 → 2617.00] is the essence
[2617.00 → 2618.30] of our lives.
[2619.06 → 2619.32] You know,
[2619.38 → 2620.18] I have a friend
[2620.18 → 2622.02] whose granddaughter
[2622.02 → 2622.90] actually was getting
[2622.90 → 2623.32] married,
[2624.28 → 2626.02] and so he met
[2626.02 → 2626.48] with the
[2626.48 → 2629.64] prospective groom,
[2630.28 → 2630.74] and he says,
[2630.78 → 2631.46] are you a Christian?
[2631.60 → 2631.78] He said,
[2631.84 → 2632.30] oh yes.
[2632.48 → 2632.78] And so,
[2632.92 → 2634.18] God is important
[2634.18 → 2634.46] to you.
[2634.46 → 2634.80] Oh yes,
[2634.84 → 2635.24] he said.
[2635.74 → 2636.02] Well,
[2636.18 → 2636.70] can you
[2636.70 → 2639.20] kind of explain
[2639.20 → 2639.50] to me
[2639.50 → 2639.96] how important
[2639.96 → 2640.58] God is?
[2641.46 → 2641.70] Well,
[2641.74 → 2642.22] he said,
[2642.72 → 2644.18] the first thing
[2644.18 → 2644.64] in my life
[2644.64 → 2645.28] is to make money,
[2646.38 → 2647.20] and the second
[2647.20 → 2648.00] thing is
[2648.00 → 2649.42] my family,
[2650.28 → 2651.08] and then the third,
[2651.18 → 2651.62] he says,
[2652.12 → 2652.74] there's God.
[2654.24 → 2654.72] Well,
[2654.78 → 2655.50] if we understand
[2655.50 → 2656.00] what Jesus
[2656.00 → 2656.80] is praying here,
[2656.92 → 2657.82] and many of us
[2657.82 → 2658.62] realize that,
[2659.10 → 2660.20] what this
[2660.20 → 2661.40] this young man
[2661.40 → 2664.26] articulated in terms
[2664.26 → 2665.38] of his core values
[2665.38 → 2665.88] in life
[2665.88 → 2667.28] is nonsense,
[2668.24 → 2670.36] because if we
[2670.36 → 2671.40] truly understand
[2671.40 → 2671.90] the mission
[2671.90 → 2672.96] Jesus gives us,
[2673.02 → 2673.90] then we realize
[2673.90 → 2675.90] that Jesus is Lord
[2675.90 → 2677.36] of how we make money,
[2678.46 → 2680.02] and Lord of our family
[2680.02 → 2681.18] and our relationships.
[2681.48 → 2682.40] He is the heart
[2682.40 → 2683.04] of it all,
[2683.36 → 2684.26] and everything
[2684.26 → 2685.28] is defined
[2685.28 → 2686.38] and finds its meaning
[2686.38 → 2687.18] and purpose
[2687.18 → 2688.60] through our understanding
[2688.60 → 2691.00] of who Christ is
[2691.00 → 2692.42] and our faith
[2692.42 → 2693.12] in him.
[2695.12 → 2696.62] The fifth truth
[2696.62 → 2697.44] Jesus wants
[2697.44 → 2698.32] to embrace
[2698.32 → 2699.08] is that we might
[2699.08 → 2700.70] grow spiritually
[2700.70 → 2701.54] mature.
[2702.66 → 2703.44] Verse 17,
[2703.64 → 2704.32] your word
[2704.32 → 2705.30] is the truth,
[2705.68 → 2706.90] so let this truth
[2706.90 → 2707.66] make them
[2707.66 → 2709.14] completely yours.
[2709.64 → 2710.54] Notice that,
[2710.82 → 2712.16] completely yours.
[2713.04 → 2714.20] Jesus here
[2714.20 → 2715.30] does not ask
[2715.30 → 2715.82] the Father
[2715.82 → 2716.60] that we might
[2716.60 → 2717.58] become wealthy
[2717.58 → 2719.00] or healthy
[2719.00 → 2721.12] or famous.
[2721.64 → 2722.28] He says,
[2722.62 → 2722.92] Father,
[2723.12 → 2724.98] may they become
[2724.98 → 2728.04] spiritually mature
[2728.04 → 2730.10] through your word.
[2739.30 → 2740.98] Often we like
[2740.98 → 2741.40] to think
[2741.40 → 2742.78] that Jesus'
[2743.10 → 2744.14] priorities for us
[2744.14 → 2745.02] are rather different
[2745.02 → 2745.60] from the one
[2745.60 → 2746.72] he really states
[2746.72 → 2748.06] to often
[2748.06 → 2749.06] we ask God
[2749.06 → 2749.98] to be on
[2749.98 → 2751.82] our life's agenda
[2751.82 → 2753.04] when he asks us
[2753.04 → 2753.68] really to be
[2753.68 → 2755.06] on his agenda
[2755.06 → 2756.08] for our lives.
[2757.26 → 2758.12] And he says,
[2758.54 → 2758.82] Father,
[2758.98 → 2759.82] your word
[2759.82 → 2760.98] is the truth.
[2762.34 → 2763.70] So let your truth
[2763.70 → 2764.24] make them
[2764.24 → 2765.56] completely yours.
[2765.76 → 2767.24] It is the truth
[2767.24 → 2768.24] of who God is
[2768.24 → 2769.42] and has made known
[2769.42 → 2770.22] in the scriptures
[2770.22 → 2772.46] that we find
[2772.46 → 2772.98] our purpose
[2772.98 → 2773.58] and meaning
[2773.58 → 2774.50] and how we
[2774.50 → 2775.44] become spiritual
[2775.44 → 2775.98] mature.
[2781.82 → 2782.42] You know,
[2782.48 → 2783.18] when I was still
[2783.18 → 2784.48] pastor
[2784.48 → 2785.52] of a
[2785.52 → 2786.76] congregation,
[2786.76 → 2787.66] I would lead
[2787.66 → 2789.12] in the congregational
[2789.12 → 2789.58] prayer
[2789.58 → 2790.16] and there were
[2790.16 → 2791.34] people who would
[2791.34 → 2791.72] be sick
[2791.72 → 2792.20] and we'd pray
[2792.20 → 2792.54] for them
[2792.54 → 2793.32] and so we should.
[2796.00 → 2796.80] But I always
[2796.80 → 2797.60] tried to remember
[2797.60 → 2798.64] not just to pray
[2798.64 → 2799.56] for their healing.
[2803.16 → 2804.22] I would usually
[2804.22 → 2805.30] pray that Father
[2805.30 → 2806.60] may through
[2806.60 → 2808.40] the illness
[2808.40 → 2809.84] that Joey
[2809.84 → 2811.02] is experiencing,
[2813.02 → 2813.86] Joey might
[2813.86 → 2815.34] learn something
[2815.34 → 2815.86] of you
[2815.86 → 2817.60] that he never
[2817.60 → 2818.28] had been able
[2818.28 → 2819.32] to learn before.
[2821.50 → 2822.68] Jesus asked
[2822.68 → 2823.14] the Father
[2823.14 → 2823.84] that we might
[2823.84 → 2825.06] become spiritually
[2825.06 → 2826.14] mature.
[2827.52 → 2828.62] Notice verse 15,
[2828.64 → 2829.88] I'm not asking
[2829.88 → 2830.46] you to take
[2830.46 → 2830.80] them out
[2830.80 → 2831.40] of the world
[2831.40 → 2832.58] but to keep
[2832.58 → 2833.06] them safe
[2833.06 → 2833.86] from the evil
[2833.86 → 2834.34] one.
[2836.54 → 2837.36] Jesus here
[2837.36 → 2837.72] says,
[2837.88 → 2838.06] Father,
[2838.20 → 2839.54] I'm not asking
[2839.54 → 2840.52] that those
[2840.52 → 2841.32] who will believe
[2841.32 → 2842.18] in me eventually
[2842.18 → 2842.88] that they will
[2842.88 → 2843.50] live on easy
[2843.50 → 2844.10] street.
[2844.98 → 2846.22] I'm not asking
[2846.22 → 2846.86] you to take
[2846.86 → 2847.80] away their trials.
[2848.60 → 2849.64] I'm not asking
[2849.64 → 2850.52] you to take
[2850.52 → 2851.76] away their pain
[2851.76 → 2852.84] and their problems
[2852.84 → 2853.88] in life.
[2854.82 → 2855.80] And I'm not asking
[2855.80 → 2856.44] you to take them
[2856.44 → 2857.48] to heaven right away.
[2857.48 → 2858.94] no,
[2859.08 → 2859.82] I leave them
[2859.82 → 2860.56] in the world
[2860.56 → 2861.22] where there will
[2861.22 → 2862.16] be tough times.
[2862.64 → 2863.68] I'm just praying
[2863.68 → 2864.50] that you would
[2864.50 → 2865.68] deliver them
[2865.68 → 2866.40] from the evil
[2866.40 → 2866.88] one.
[2870.12 → 2871.20] And most of us
[2871.20 → 2871.98] are mature enough
[2871.98 → 2872.56] to realize
[2872.56 → 2873.28] that we don't
[2873.28 → 2874.02] grow spiritually
[2874.02 → 2875.26] by being comfortable
[2875.26 → 2876.02] all the time.
[2877.18 → 2878.48] When life is good
[2878.48 → 2879.72] and as it can be,
[2880.22 → 2881.54] we have to be careful
[2881.54 → 2882.18] that we don't
[2882.18 → 2882.86] stop growing
[2882.86 → 2883.58] spiritually.
[2883.58 → 2883.70] spiritually.
[2885.04 → 2885.90] We grow
[2885.90 → 2886.66] through tests
[2886.66 → 2887.26] and we grow
[2887.26 → 2887.98] through trials
[2887.98 → 2888.70] and we grow
[2888.70 → 2889.80] through tribulations.
[2891.22 → 2891.78] And Jesus
[2891.78 → 2892.48] prays,
[2892.56 → 2892.90] Father,
[2893.70 → 2894.56] may the truth
[2894.56 → 2896.00] define those
[2896.00 → 2896.60] issues
[2896.60 → 2897.68] that they may
[2897.68 → 2898.34] become
[2898.34 → 2899.94] spiritually mature.
[2900.80 → 2901.54] And so again,
[2901.68 → 2902.20] some of us
[2902.20 → 2902.98] need to be
[2902.98 → 2904.62] aware that
[2904.62 → 2905.16] maybe we
[2905.16 → 2906.18] are praying
[2906.18 → 2906.78] too often
[2906.78 → 2907.50] for a
[2907.50 → 2908.98] comfortable life
[2908.98 → 2910.94] when Jesus
[2910.94 → 2911.40] wants us
[2911.40 → 2911.68] to pray
[2911.68 → 2912.10] for a
[2912.10 → 2912.64] spiritually
[2912.64 → 2913.44] empowered
[2913.44 → 2914.02] life.
[2915.56 → 2916.30] The sixth
[2916.30 → 2916.78] life truth
[2916.78 → 2917.38] Jesus wants
[2917.38 → 2917.86] to embrace
[2917.86 → 2918.38] that we might
[2918.38 → 2919.08] connect deeply
[2919.08 → 2919.92] with others.
[2921.20 → 2921.68] Jesus
[2921.68 → 2922.58] reminds us
[2922.58 → 2923.20] in this prayer
[2923.20 → 2923.80] that we're not
[2923.80 → 2924.36] meant to go
[2924.36 → 2924.88] through life
[2924.88 → 2925.14] alone,
[2925.22 → 2925.80] that we need
[2925.80 → 2926.26] one another.
[2926.34 → 2926.70] In fact,
[2926.90 → 2927.64] that we need
[2927.64 → 2928.28] deep,
[2928.48 → 2928.98] authentic
[2928.98 → 2929.88] relationships
[2929.88 → 2930.80] with other
[2930.80 → 2931.32] believers.
[2931.86 → 2932.58] Verse 21,
[2933.50 → 2934.42] my prayer
[2934.42 → 2935.36] for all of
[2935.36 → 2935.72] them,
[2935.94 → 2936.74] all of them,
[2937.10 → 2937.88] is that they
[2937.88 → 2938.76] will be one
[2938.76 → 2939.70] just as you
[2939.70 → 2940.28] and I
[2940.28 → 2940.76] are one,
[2940.94 → 2941.20] Father,
[2941.62 → 2942.20] that just
[2942.20 → 2942.74] as you
[2942.74 → 2943.34] are in me
[2943.34 → 2943.88] and I
[2943.88 → 2944.46] am in
[2944.46 → 2945.72] you,
[2946.04 → 2946.76] so they
[2946.76 → 2947.28] will be
[2947.28 → 2947.96] in us
[2947.96 → 2948.52] and the
[2948.52 → 2948.96] world
[2948.96 → 2950.04] will believe
[2950.04 → 2950.52] that you
[2950.52 → 2951.34] sent me.
[2952.34 → 2952.90] Again,
[2953.06 → 2953.80] taking the
[2953.80 → 2955.26] template,
[2955.42 → 2955.96] if you will,
[2956.04 → 2956.34] of the
[2956.34 → 2956.74] divine
[2956.74 → 2957.54] relationship,
[2957.80 → 2958.10] Father,
[2958.28 → 2958.50] Son,
[2958.58 → 2959.00] and Holy
[2959.00 → 2959.56] Spirit,
[2960.06 → 2960.38] Jesus
[2960.38 → 2960.82] prays,
[2960.88 → 2961.08] Father,
[2961.16 → 2961.54] what we
[2961.54 → 2962.74] together have,
[2963.92 → 2964.36] may that
[2964.36 → 2964.80] kind of
[2964.80 → 2965.32] unity be
[2965.32 → 2965.98] experienced
[2965.98 → 2966.52] with those
[2966.52 → 2967.12] who believe
[2967.12 → 2967.64] in me,
[2967.88 → 2968.66] and when
[2968.66 → 2969.18] they do,
[2969.30 → 2969.90] the world
[2969.90 → 2970.42] will take
[2970.42 → 2970.92] notice
[2970.92 → 2971.84] that you
[2971.84 → 2972.60] sent me.
[2980.36 → 2981.08] Are we
[2981.08 → 2981.64] intentional
[2981.64 → 2982.10] about,
[2982.24 → 2982.84] not just
[2982.84 → 2983.12] about
[2983.12 → 2983.78] developing
[2983.78 → 2986.76] relationships,
[2986.94 → 2987.06] you know,
[2987.10 → 2987.62] I remember
[2987.62 → 2988.52] years ago,
[2988.60 → 2989.16] my preaching
[2989.16 → 2989.70] went through
[2989.70 → 2990.84] a number
[2990.84 → 2991.42] of stages,
[2991.54 → 2991.86] but one
[2991.86 → 2992.16] of them
[2992.16 → 2992.78] was,
[2993.74 → 2994.36] and it
[2994.36 → 2996.06] was like
[2996.06 → 2996.54] a eureka
[2996.54 → 2996.94] moment
[2996.94 → 2997.30] when I
[2997.30 → 2997.94] realized
[2997.94 → 2999.20] that nothing
[2999.20 → 3000.06] is more
[3000.06 → 3000.48] important
[3000.48 → 3001.10] than life,
[3002.06 → 3002.58] even in
[3002.58 → 3003.12] its ultimate
[3003.12 → 3003.74] sense,
[3004.22 → 3004.84] nothing is
[3004.84 → 3005.74] more important
[3005.74 → 3006.20] in life
[3006.20 → 3006.38] than
[3006.38 → 3007.22] relationships.
[3008.04 → 3008.58] Beginning
[3008.58 → 3009.00] with our
[3009.00 → 3009.50] relationship
[3009.50 → 3009.98] with God
[3009.98 → 3010.60] and Christ
[3010.60 → 3011.32] and all
[3011.32 → 3011.72] the other
[3011.72 → 3012.18] relationships,
[3012.34 → 3012.76] then take
[3012.76 → 3013.20] its meaning
[3013.20 → 3013.68] from that
[3013.68 → 3014.10] fundamental
[3014.10 → 3014.74] relationship.
[3014.74 → 3014.96] relationships.
[3016.10 → 3016.50] And my
[3016.50 → 3017.18] question is,
[3017.30 → 3017.74] not just
[3017.74 → 3018.00] are you
[3018.00 → 3018.42] developing
[3018.42 → 3019.08] relationships,
[3019.28 → 3019.64] most of
[3019.64 → 3020.14] us are,
[3020.28 → 3025.36] but how
[3025.36 → 3026.12] accepting are
[3026.12 → 3026.46] we of
[3026.46 → 3027.16] those with
[3027.16 → 3027.80] whom we
[3027.80 → 3028.24] disagree?
[3028.24 → 3030.32] are we
[3030.32 → 3031.64] too quick
[3031.64 → 3032.28] to build
[3032.28 → 3033.84] walls
[3033.84 → 3034.44] rather than
[3034.44 → 3034.72] bridges?
[3035.68 → 3036.28] Jesus
[3036.28 → 3037.50] prays,
[3037.56 → 3037.80] Father,
[3037.92 → 3038.42] the unity
[3038.42 → 3038.88] that you
[3038.88 → 3039.14] and I
[3039.14 → 3039.80] experience,
[3040.14 → 3042.08] may those
[3042.08 → 3042.64] who believe
[3042.64 → 3043.16] in me,
[3043.20 → 3043.66] may they
[3043.66 → 3044.26] experience
[3044.26 → 3044.64] that,
[3044.84 → 3045.40] and the
[3045.40 → 3046.22] world will
[3046.22 → 3046.72] know that
[3046.72 → 3047.14] you are
[3047.14 → 3048.38] the one
[3048.38 → 3048.94] who sent
[3048.94 → 3049.28] me.
[3050.06 → 3050.80] It is a
[3050.80 → 3051.26] great
[3051.26 → 3053.20] evangelistic
[3053.20 → 3054.36] tool when
[3054.36 → 3055.06] the world
[3055.06 → 3056.26] sees the
[3056.26 → 3057.04] unity that
[3057.04 → 3057.50] is among
[3057.50 → 3057.94] us.
[3060.86 → 3061.20] And then
[3061.20 → 3061.74] the last
[3061.74 → 3062.74] life truth
[3062.74 → 3063.70] Jesus wants
[3063.70 → 3064.56] to embrace
[3064.56 → 3065.70] is this.
[3066.82 → 3067.14] Jesus
[3067.14 → 3067.80] prays that
[3067.80 → 3068.40] we might
[3068.40 → 3069.44] serve Christ
[3069.44 → 3070.24] effectively.
[3070.48 → 3071.24] Verse 17,
[3072.84 → 3073.72] make them
[3073.72 → 3074.30] ready for
[3074.30 → 3075.10] your service
[3075.10 → 3076.12] through your
[3076.12 → 3076.64] truth.
[3077.36 → 3078.30] You're teaching
[3078.30 → 3079.28] is truth.
[3080.94 → 3081.48] Jesus
[3081.48 → 3081.86] here
[3081.86 → 3083.86] reminds us
[3083.86 → 3084.22] and he
[3084.22 → 3085.02] prays
[3085.02 → 3086.50] that life,
[3086.50 → 3087.40] if we
[3087.40 → 3088.18] understand it
[3088.18 → 3088.46] well,
[3088.62 → 3089.26] is all
[3089.26 → 3089.58] about
[3089.58 → 3090.32] service.
[3092.20 → 3092.80] Service
[3092.80 → 3093.30] within our
[3093.30 → 3093.66] family,
[3093.82 → 3094.14] service
[3094.14 → 3094.80] within our
[3094.80 → 3096.02] work,
[3096.18 → 3097.12] service in
[3097.12 → 3097.32] our
[3097.32 → 3098.02] community.
[3099.12 → 3099.56] Ultimately,
[3099.94 → 3100.56] life is
[3100.56 → 3101.66] about service.
[3101.66 → 3101.78] service.
[3103.30 → 3103.72] You know,
[3103.78 → 3104.60] for a time,
[3104.72 → 3105.04] one of my
[3105.04 → 3105.80] favourite authors
[3105.80 → 3106.48] was Leonard
[3106.48 → 3106.96] Sweet.
[3107.80 → 3108.22] And the
[3108.22 → 3108.62] reason I
[3108.62 → 3109.06] liked him
[3109.06 → 3110.00] is not so
[3110.00 → 3110.52] much about
[3110.52 → 3111.24] the depth
[3111.24 → 3111.78] of his
[3111.78 → 3112.32] thinking,
[3112.68 → 3113.48] but because
[3113.48 → 3113.92] of the
[3113.92 → 3115.30] many ideas
[3115.30 → 3115.74] he would
[3115.74 → 3116.36] put forward.
[3116.52 → 3117.14] I remember
[3117.14 → 3118.54] reading two
[3118.54 → 3119.40] short paragraphs
[3119.40 → 3120.04] in one of
[3120.04 → 3120.52] his books,
[3121.28 → 3122.48] and I said
[3122.48 → 3122.86] to myself,
[3122.96 → 3123.08] boy,
[3123.14 → 3123.66] he must be
[3123.66 → 3124.50] on ADHD
[3124.50 → 3125.46] because his
[3125.46 → 3126.10] pages are
[3126.10 → 3127.02] littered with
[3127.02 → 3127.48] ideas.
[3127.48 → 3128.08] In the space
[3128.08 → 3128.50] of a few
[3128.50 → 3128.96] sentences,
[3128.96 → 3129.58] he talked
[3129.58 → 3129.96] about
[3129.96 → 3130.66] Walter
[3130.66 → 3131.42] Conk right's
[3131.42 → 3132.22] sailboat and
[3132.22 → 3132.94] about quantum
[3132.94 → 3133.68] mechanics and
[3133.68 → 3134.36] how Baptists
[3134.36 → 3134.96] ought to learn
[3134.96 → 3135.50] to dance.
[3136.50 → 3137.10] And it's
[3137.10 → 3137.98] like a brain
[3137.98 → 3138.42] that is,
[3138.62 → 3138.96] you know,
[3139.72 → 3141.20] it's like a
[3141.20 → 3141.94] chipmunk on
[3141.94 → 3142.62] steroids.
[3145.44 → 3146.18] But there's
[3146.18 → 3147.50] one line
[3147.50 → 3148.16] that he wrote,
[3148.34 → 3149.16] a brief line,
[3149.92 → 3150.60] that I knew
[3150.60 → 3152.24] the instant
[3152.24 → 3152.80] that I read
[3152.80 → 3153.06] it,
[3153.82 → 3154.46] that I would
[3154.46 → 3155.48] never forget
[3155.48 → 3155.78] it.
[3156.50 → 3156.94] In fact,
[3157.00 → 3157.38] I wondered
[3157.38 → 3158.34] why Paul or
[3158.34 → 3158.88] Peter or
[3158.88 → 3159.74] John never
[3159.74 → 3160.26] wrote them,
[3161.28 → 3162.06] those words.
[3162.38 → 3162.74] And it's
[3162.74 → 3163.48] simply this.
[3163.90 → 3164.50] He said,
[3165.78 → 3167.58] your baptism
[3167.58 → 3169.60] is your
[3169.60 → 3170.24] ordination
[3170.24 → 3172.00] to ministry.
[3176.10 → 3177.22] Your baptism
[3177.22 → 3178.92] is your
[3178.92 → 3179.44] ordination
[3179.44 → 3180.20] to ministry.
[3180.46 → 3180.74] You know,
[3181.24 → 3182.00] a year ago,
[3182.14 → 3182.68] I did the
[3182.80 → 3183.32] what is called
[3183.32 → 3184.40] with a big
[3184.40 → 3185.20] phrase,
[3185.34 → 3186.06] the colloquium
[3186.06 → 3186.82] dictum for
[3186.82 → 3187.64] Pastor Jason.
[3187.64 → 3189.06] I examined
[3189.06 → 3190.20] him theologically
[3190.20 → 3191.24] and biblically
[3191.24 → 3192.14] and of course
[3192.14 → 3192.80] he passed.
[3192.92 → 3193.66] It is part
[3193.66 → 3194.14] of his
[3194.14 → 3196.98] steps
[3196.98 → 3197.38] toward
[3197.38 → 3198.00] ordination.
[3199.00 → 3199.56] And that
[3199.56 → 3199.92] is good.
[3200.02 → 3200.46] We need to
[3200.46 → 3201.64] have people
[3201.64 → 3202.76] properly prepared
[3202.76 → 3203.50] and all that
[3203.50 → 3204.38] in order to
[3204.38 → 3205.62] be ministers
[3205.62 → 3206.26] of God's
[3206.26 → 3206.72] word.
[3207.82 → 3208.70] A week ago,
[3208.80 → 3210.02] I was in
[3210.02 → 3211.10] Edmonton
[3211.10 → 3211.82] to do something
[3211.82 → 3212.62] very similar.
[3213.06 → 3213.44] And that's
[3213.44 → 3213.78] good.
[3213.78 → 3214.86] But we
[3214.86 → 3215.34] make the
[3215.34 → 3215.80] mistake
[3215.80 → 3216.52] that those
[3216.52 → 3216.84] of us
[3216.84 → 3217.28] who stand
[3217.28 → 3217.66] up here
[3217.66 → 3218.16] and unfold
[3218.16 → 3218.54] God's
[3218.54 → 3218.90] word are
[3218.90 → 3219.40] somehow
[3219.40 → 3220.68] the ones
[3220.68 → 3220.98] who do
[3220.98 → 3221.50] the serving
[3221.50 → 3222.54] when in
[3222.54 → 3222.98] fact,
[3223.26 → 3223.86] if you
[3223.86 → 3224.54] are baptized,
[3225.34 → 3226.04] then God
[3226.04 → 3227.04] himself has
[3227.04 → 3227.84] ordained you
[3227.84 → 3229.32] to serve
[3229.32 → 3229.76] him.
[3233.52 → 3234.36] Two thousand
[3234.36 → 3235.10] years ago,
[3235.36 → 3235.98] Jesus was
[3235.98 → 3236.56] praying for
[3236.56 → 3237.08] us and he
[3237.08 → 3237.28] asked,
[3237.44 → 3237.76] Father,
[3238.38 → 3238.86] make them
[3238.86 → 3240.74] ready for
[3240.74 → 3241.48] your service.
[3243.14 → 3243.90] And that
[3243.90 → 3244.42] brings us
[3244.42 → 3244.76] to the
[3244.76 → 3245.04] second
[3245.04 → 3245.58] principle.
[3245.76 → 3246.08] Remember
[3246.08 → 3246.46] that the
[3246.46 → 3246.76] first
[3246.76 → 3247.28] principle
[3247.28 → 3250.32] is this.
[3250.44 → 3251.18] Before we
[3251.18 → 3251.60] can give
[3251.60 → 3252.28] Jesus what
[3252.28 → 3252.54] he wants
[3252.54 → 3253.06] from us,
[3253.12 → 3253.46] we must
[3253.46 → 3253.86] embrace
[3253.86 → 3254.14] what he
[3254.14 → 3254.48] wants,
[3254.48 → 3255.36] what Jesus
[3255.36 → 3256.12] wants for
[3256.12 → 3256.54] us.
[3256.68 → 3256.84] Well,
[3256.92 → 3257.26] here's
[3257.26 → 3257.64] the second
[3257.64 → 3258.12] principle.
[3260.64 → 3261.62] When we
[3261.62 → 3262.34] embrace
[3262.34 → 3263.14] what Jesus
[3263.14 → 3264.10] wants for
[3264.10 → 3264.56] us,
[3264.94 → 3266.12] we gloriously
[3266.12 → 3267.40] receive what
[3267.40 → 3268.18] we've been
[3268.18 → 3269.30] looking for
[3269.30 → 3270.84] all along.
[3273.20 → 3274.10] In other
[3274.10 → 3274.54] words,
[3275.50 → 3276.62] what Jesus
[3276.62 → 3278.48] prays in
[3278.48 → 3279.84] this John
[3279.84 → 3280.98] 17 prayer in
[3280.98 → 3281.44] the upper
[3281.44 → 3281.96] room for
[3281.96 → 3282.36] you and
[3282.36 → 3284.26] me is
[3284.26 → 3284.96] meant to
[3284.96 → 3285.64] meet our
[3285.64 → 3286.10] deepest
[3286.10 → 3286.82] needs.
[3287.32 → 3288.22] When we
[3288.22 → 3289.14] embrace these
[3289.14 → 3289.84] things that
[3289.84 → 3290.98] Jesus asked
[3290.98 → 3291.48] us to
[3291.48 → 3292.06] have,
[3292.98 → 3294.14] we receive
[3294.14 → 3295.52] what we've
[3295.52 → 3295.96] been looking
[3295.96 → 3297.86] for all
[3297.86 → 3298.34] along.
[3299.30 → 3300.28] you know,
[3300.34 → 3300.64] there's a
[3300.64 → 3301.36] story about
[3301.36 → 3302.70] a Sunday
[3302.70 → 3303.44] school class
[3303.44 → 3304.26] of great
[3304.26 → 3306.16] or age
[3306.16 → 3306.58] four and
[3306.58 → 3307.08] five
[3307.08 → 3308.12] children,
[3308.62 → 3309.52] and the
[3309.52 → 3310.38] teacher asked
[3310.38 → 3310.96] the class,
[3311.14 → 3311.88] does anybody
[3311.88 → 3312.88] know Psalm
[3312.88 → 3313.54] 23?
[3313.80 → 3314.32] Can anybody
[3314.32 → 3315.28] recite Psalm
[3315.28 → 3315.92] 23?
[3317.66 → 3318.34] In the back
[3318.34 → 3318.82] row, there was
[3318.82 → 3319.10] a little
[3319.10 → 3319.66] four-year-old
[3319.66 → 3319.98] girl,
[3321.72 → 3323.32] and the
[3323.32 → 3323.78] teacher said,
[3323.78 → 3324.52] Susie, can you
[3324.52 → 3325.26] really recite
[3325.26 → 3326.00] Psalm 23?
[3326.26 → 3326.52] I said,
[3326.60 → 3326.74] yeah.
[3326.74 → 3328.82] And so
[3328.82 → 3329.46] little Susie,
[3329.54 → 3330.42] she came
[3330.42 → 3331.30] forward, she
[3331.30 → 3332.30] took a little
[3332.30 → 3333.92] bow, and
[3333.92 → 3334.50] she said,
[3335.16 → 3336.46] the Lord is
[3336.46 → 3337.10] my shepherd,
[3337.80 → 3339.80] that's all I
[3339.80 → 3340.18] want.
[3342.82 → 3343.64] And she took
[3343.64 → 3344.20] a little bow,
[3344.86 → 3346.04] and she sat
[3346.04 → 3346.42] down.
[3347.08 → 3348.02] I don't know
[3348.02 → 3348.44] of a better
[3348.44 → 3349.20] interpretation of
[3349.20 → 3350.08] Psalm 23 than
[3350.08 → 3350.40] that.
[3351.08 → 3351.94] The Lord is my
[3351.94 → 3352.26] shepherd,
[3353.26 → 3354.22] that's all I
[3354.22 → 3354.58] want.
[3354.58 → 3354.72] God.
[3357.24 → 3357.92] And John
[3357.92 → 3360.46] 17 makes
[3360.46 → 3361.90] clear that
[3361.90 → 3362.46] when we
[3362.46 → 3363.44] embrace the
[3363.44 → 3364.36] very thing
[3364.36 → 3365.42] Jesus wants
[3365.42 → 3366.24] for us,
[3367.38 → 3370.58] we receive
[3370.58 → 3371.70] what we're
[3371.70 → 3372.48] looking for
[3372.48 → 3373.70] all along.
[3375.02 → 3376.14] And there's
[3376.14 → 3377.08] nothing more
[3377.08 → 3377.48] beautiful.
[3378.68 → 3379.24] Let's pray.
[3379.24 → 3379.32] Amen.
[3379.32 → 3379.36] Amen.
[3379.36 → 3379.40] Amen.
[3379.40 → 3379.42] Amen.
[3379.42 → 3379.44] Amen.
[3379.44 → 3379.46] Amen.
[3379.46 → 3379.52] Amen.
[3379.52 → 3379.54] Amen.
[3379.54 → 3379.56] Amen.
[3379.56 → 3379.58] Amen.
[3379.58 → 3380.04] Amen.
[3380.04 → 3380.08] Amen.
[3380.08 → 3381.36] Amen.
[3381.36 → 3381.40] Amen.
[3381.40 → 3381.44] Amen.
[3381.44 → 3381.52] Amen.
[3381.52 → 3381.54] Amen.
[3384.58 → 3389.96] Amen.
[3393.86 → 3394.48] Amen.
[3403.76 → 3407.84] Amen.
[3407.96 → 3408.64] Amen.
[3408.64 → 3408.88] Amen.
[3408.88 → 3409.18] Amen.
[3409.18 → 3409.22] Amen.
[3410.56 → 3411.12] Amen.
[3411.12 → 3414.18] Amen.
[3414.18 → 3419.10] new to these great truths that you want us to have.
[3419.58 → 3422.92] That we may know the full extent of your love
[3422.92 → 3427.40] and be completely immersed in your joy
[3427.40 → 3429.12] no matter what the circumstances are.
[3429.20 → 3432.06] That we may know that our life has purpose and meaning
[3432.06 → 3433.60] when we go to work tomorrow.
[3435.48 → 3438.22] And that all life, including our relationships,
[3438.22 → 3441.70] are defined by our relationship with you.
[3442.70 → 3445.72] And that, Lord, that we are not meant to go through life alone,
[3445.78 → 3448.38] but that we ought to live together as brothers and sisters
[3448.38 → 3451.42] in such unity that the world cannot help
[3451.42 → 3456.76] but take notice that you indeed are the one the Father sent.
[3457.90 → 3461.18] And so accept our faith, O Father, and renew what we pray.
[3461.68 → 3463.68] In Jesus' name, amen.
[3471.70 → 3490.18] So that'll be okay on the screen there.
[3490.60 → 3492.10] Can we do Good Shepherd?
[3492.60 → 3494.06] Can we go back to that one?
[3494.06 → 3495.08] The Simply Being
[3495.08 → 3497.68] By the President Pastor.
[3498.78 → 3499.82] Great. Thank you.
[3501.48 → 3509.76] Please stand.
[3509.76 → 3514.78] Lord, you are our shepherd
[3514.78 → 3518.32] We will fight for good with me
[3518.32 → 3521.80] For you take us to the past
[3521.80 → 3524.70] For things that are being
[3524.70 → 3529.22] You need each side still warm
[3529.22 → 3532.86] Bring refreshing to our souls
[3532.86 → 3536.48] As you guide us to the paths
[3536.48 → 3538.86] That make us free
[3538.86 → 3541.94] Beyond
[3541.94 → 3548.78] Beyond
[3548.78 → 3550.88] Beyond
[3550.88 → 3558.26] Though we walk through depths of our ground
[3558.26 → 3561.92] We are there going away
[3561.92 → 3567.86] To bring comfort in the presence of our hope
[3567.86 → 3572.88] You and Lord, our heads may bow
[3572.88 → 3576.50] And send mercy with us now
[3576.50 → 3582.94] As they dwell in your arms forevermore
[3582.94 → 3585.98] Beyond
[3585.98 → 3589.94] Beyond
[3589.94 → 3594.96] We are
[3594.96 → 3599.96] We are
[3599.96 → 3601.96] We are
[3601.96 → 3606.96] We are
[3606.96 → 3616.48] Lord, you are our shepherd
[3616.48 → 3616.98] We are
[3616.98 → 3617.98] We are
[3617.98 → 3618.98] We are
[3618.98 → 3619.98] We are
[3619.98 → 3620.98] We are
[3620.98 → 3621.98] We are
[3621.98 → 3622.98] We are
[3622.98 → 3623.98] We are
[3623.98 → 3641.00] We are
[3641.00 → 3642.00] We are
[3642.00 → 3644.00] We are
[3644.00 → 3646.00] We are
[3646.00 → 3647.00] We are
[3647.00 → 3648.94] We are
[3648.96 → 3651.46] We are
[3651.46 → 3656.64] We are

[3661.52 → 3665.82] We are
[3665.82 → 3666.74] We are
[3666.74 → 3670.74] The presence of our foes
[3670.74 → 3674.74] In return as we walk
[3674.74 → 3678.74] In the same mercy of our star
[3678.74 → 3684.74] As we turn us forevermore
[3684.74 → 3704.74] In return as we walk
[3704.74 → 3710.74] In return as we walk
[3710.74 → 3720.86] Thank you Pastor Broker for the message
[3720.86 → 3723.52] It's funny the other day my daughter Annika asked
[3723.52 → 3725.66] What a profession of faith was
[3725.66 → 3727.96] And I told her it's when you tell everybody
[3727.96 → 3728.96] That you believe in God
[3728.96 → 3731.76] And then I said and also after you do that
[3731.76 → 3733.40] Everybody starts asking you to volunteer
[3733.40 → 3733.96] So
[3733.96 → 3737.56] I felt a little bit bad for it
[3737.56 → 3739.20] It sounded a little cynical at the time
[3739.20 → 3741.36] But in light of the message I think we're okay there
[3741.36 → 3741.92] So
[3741.92 → 3745.64] Yeah so today's offering this morning is for
[3745.64 → 3746.60] Cascade Christian
[3746.60 → 3747.74] Oh I'm sorry
[3747.74 → 3750.30] I thought it was Cascade Christian Counselling
[3750.30 → 3752.16] But apparently it's the Nomi national Ministry
[3752.16 → 3752.60] So
[3752.60 → 3755.36] Anyway if the
[3755.36 → 3757.02] Deacons can come forward
[3757.02 → 3758.96] And collect the offering
[3758.96 → 3759.36] Thank you

[3918.40 → 3925.40] I believe we've got it straight now that the offering was for Cascade Christian Counselling, so hopefully you're all okay with giving to that needy cause.
[3925.40 → 3939.40] Before we come to God in prayer, I'd just like to mention that yesterday we got the sad news that Henry Vatican had taken a serious fall in the backyard and looks like she's fractured her hip.
[3939.40 → 3947.40] So she's being treated in hospital now, I believe still at South Delta, and then we're hoping that she's transferred to Royal Columbian for surgery.
[3947.40 → 3952.40] So, of course, we'll be keeping her and her family in our prayer this morning.
[3952.40 → 3961.40] So, and beyond that I'd like to continue this morning with the tradition that Jason started with us reciting the Lord's Prayer at the end of the congregational prayer.
[3961.40 → 3966.40] So, if you could just please join me with that when you hear me start, you can join in.
[3966.40 → 3968.40] So, let's come to God in prayer.
[3972.40 → 3977.40] Heavenly Father, we come to you this morning as a broken, wayward people.
[3977.40 → 3988.40] You come to us as a shepherd, a healer, a counsellor full of love, mercy and grace, an ever-present God who hears and delights in our prayers.
[3988.40 → 3993.40] We come to you, Lord, this morning with heavy burdens for there's much suffering in the world.
[3994.40 → 4002.40] We pray for peace in Gaza where war has been part of life for generation after generation.
[4003.40 → 4008.40] We pray that revenge and hatred gives way to tolerance and understanding.
[4008.40 → 4011.40] We pray to you for your grain.
[4011.40 → 4014.40] Restore your sovereignty, O Lord.
[4014.40 → 4019.40] And turn the hearts of the leaders towards peace rather than violence.
[4020.40 → 4027.40] Be with the people of Haiti where lawlessness threatens to give way to civil war and even more bloodshed.
[4027.40 → 4041.40] Any, as we pray for the many places in the world where political instability has taken on a life of its own, and it's all that people have ever known.
[4041.40 → 4047.40] Closer to home, we pray for the well-being of our community here in Ladder.
[4048.40 → 4051.40] For those struggling against daily pain and chronic health issues.
[4052.40 → 4059.40] We pray for those dealing with unseen suffering such as mental illness, addiction, depression, with loss and loneliness.
[4060.40 → 4064.40] What we struggle to see, Lord, you know intimately.
[4064.40 → 4069.40] Father, we pray for the rest of British Columbia and especially for Vancouver.
[4070.40 → 4073.40] For those living on the street, overcome with addiction.
[4073.40 → 4078.40] We ask, Lord, that you rid them of such a terrible and debilitating disease and bring them peace.
[4079.40 → 4082.40] Here in Ladder, we are insulated from the suffering and the pain.
[4083.40 → 4087.40] Perhaps so insulated that our hearts become hardened or even apathetic.
[4087.40 → 4091.40] Help us to see the value in every person.
[4092.40 → 4094.40] To see them as you see them.
[4096.40 → 4098.40] Lord, we pray for the friends and family.
[4099.40 → 4102.40] For those who die of drug overdoses.
[4103.40 → 4105.40] Thousands have died like this last year.
[4106.40 → 4112.40] Often with no one to love them to turn to, it's easy to say, see how people turn towards drugs instead.
[4113.40 → 4115.40] Be near to them and be merciful.
[4115.40 → 4117.40] Let them know that they are loved.
[4118.40 → 4122.40] May we be merciful and loving and kind, even when it feels like we're getting nowhere.
[4123.40 → 4129.40] And Lord, we pray too for those suffering from other illnesses, especially in our congregation.
[4130.40 → 4133.40] For those sick with cancer, heart conditions.
[4134.40 → 4136.40] For those dealing with the everyday effects of old age.
[4137.40 → 4141.40] And for those like a Siouan who are dealing with illnesses that the doctors are still trying to understand.
[4141.40 → 4147.40] We especially pray for strength and healing for Henry Astatine as she is treated for a broken hip.
[4148.40 → 4151.40] Be with her and her physicians and nurses.
[4152.40 → 4155.40] And may she heal fully and quickly.
[4155.40 → 4156.40] And quickly.
[4156.40 → 4161.40] We pray too for those mourning the loss of loved ones.
[4162.40 → 4169.40] Be with my grandmother and my aunt and the rest of the family as we grieve the loss of my Uncle Paul who passed away from stomach cancer on Thursday.
[4169.40 → 4179.40] Lord, we hope and pray that he is with you now in glory with a new body, free from pain of the last few months.
[4180.40 → 4185.40] And Lord, we pray to that Angelina and the rest of their family come to know you if they already haven't.
[4185.40 → 4189.40] We lift these dear friends up to you, Lord.
[4190.40 → 4191.40] Ease their suffering and their grief.
[4192.40 → 4195.40] We know you are a God who suffers with us and for us.
[4196.40 → 4197.40] May they know you, Lord.
[4198.40 → 4200.40] Walk as you walk among us and fill us with your spirit.
[4201.40 → 4204.40] Help us to always look to you when we struggle.
[4204.40 → 4214.40] And then, Lord, even in all of this, you give us hope.
[4215.40 → 4223.40] We praise you and thank you, Lord, for the safe arrival of baby Lydia, the fourth daughter of Kikuyu and Slam.
[4224.40 → 4230.40] And Lydia, we hope that she grows up to know you, Lord, and to love you.
[4230.40 → 4235.40] Now, Lord, as Jesus taught us how to pray, may we say together,
[4236.40 → 4240.40] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4241.40 → 4245.40] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4246.40 → 4253.40] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
