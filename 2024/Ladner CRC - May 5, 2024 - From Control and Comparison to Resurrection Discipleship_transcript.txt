[326.60 --> 329.60]  Good morning.
[329.60 --> 330.60]  Good morning.
[330.60 --> 334.60]  Welcome to Worship Today at Latin-Nerd Christian Reformed Church.
[334.60 --> 338.60]  If you are new with us today, we especially want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[338.60 --> 340.60]  We're so glad that you're here.
[340.60 --> 347.60]  For all of our regular members and those joining us online, we're so glad that the Lord has
[347.60 --> 354.50]  us together that we might worship him as his people and as one body together today. So before
[354.50 --> 359.42]  we get started, I just want to draw your attention to a few announcements. If you have a bulletin,
[359.58 --> 365.10]  they're all there. Right on the front though, you'll see that I think it's next May 12th. Is
[365.10 --> 370.52]  that next Sunday? Yeah. So that next Sunday we'll have our Mountain View singing. So we're singing
[370.52 --> 376.54]  at the Mountain View Care Home at two o'clock in the afternoon. So that's after the service next
[376.54 --> 385.20]  Sunday. Also you'll see that our bus trip for the seniors is coming up on May 14th. And also
[385.20 --> 393.18]  May 17th, the following Friday, we'll be participating or whoever would like to come in a concert of
[393.18 --> 400.74]  prayer, an ecumenical prayer service of churches in Delta. And that will be hosted at Sacred Heart.
[400.88 --> 406.00]  But we'll be there, Lighthouse, Baptist Church. And we come together and we just pray for our city.
[406.00 --> 413.18]  We pray for the church. We did this a couple of years ago. And so you are certainly invited and
[413.18 --> 420.04]  encouraged to join us for a time of prayer with other believers in Delta. And the last thing I'll
[420.04 --> 426.82]  say is that right after the service today, we will be having an affirmation vote for two elders or one
[426.82 --> 433.66]  clerk, clerk of council and an elder. And so if you are a member of the church, please do stay behind
[433.66 --> 439.72]  briefly as we have an affirmation vote. If you are not a member, you may stay, but you don't have to.
[440.10 --> 441.38]  You can go get your coffee.
[445.08 --> 451.82]  That is today after the service. So let's go ahead and begin our time of worship this morning with a
[451.82 --> 460.88]  call to worship from Psalm 46. And the psalm reminds us that the God we worship is a God who is strong and
[460.88 --> 468.12]  mighty, but he is also a God who is loving. He's a God who dwells with us. And he dwells with us not
[468.12 --> 477.42]  only in times past, but he is a God who dwells with his people even today, even with us now in this time
[477.42 --> 482.92]  of worship. So we'll read this responsibly. I'll begin. And then when you see a double arrow,
[482.92 --> 491.46]  I'll invite you to join along. God is our refuge and strength and ever present help in trouble.
[492.26 --> 498.88]  Therefore, we will not fear. Though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
[499.42 --> 507.02]  though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging together, there is a river
[507.02 --> 516.44]  whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. God is within her.
[516.98 --> 526.88]  She will not fall. God will help her at break of day. The Lord Almighty is with us. The God of Jacob
[526.88 --> 533.66]  is our fortress. Please join me in a prayer of praise and adoration to God. Let's pray together.
[533.66 --> 544.34]  Our Heavenly Father, we praise you because you are the God who is our refuge. Lord, when it feels like
[544.34 --> 556.22]  the world around us is crumbling, when the ocean waves rise, Lord, we feel weak. We don't know what to do.
[556.34 --> 563.58]  We feel overwhelmed sometimes. So Lord, we lift up our eyes to you. We turn to you because
[563.58 --> 573.08]  you are our strength. Father, we thank you that you dwell with your people, that you are almighty for us,
[573.26 --> 579.68]  and that you are our fortress. So God, would you be with us today as we gather to worship you? Would
[579.68 --> 586.84]  you meet each of us where we are? And would you come and dwell with us? Lord, would you be glorified
[586.84 --> 594.22]  in our time of worship? And we give you praise for sending your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to be the Lamb
[594.22 --> 601.54]  of God who takes away our sin and who is worthy for us to follow him and to listen to his voice.
[602.46 --> 608.60]  So Lord, we pray that you would be glorified and us, your people, would be strengthened today. We pray in
[608.60 --> 618.24]  Jesus' name. Amen. So please rise and we will hear God's greeting to us this morning. He calls us to
[618.24 --> 624.32]  follow him, to know him and worship him, and he greets us with these words from Psalm 46. He says,
[624.44 --> 634.92]  Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.
[634.92 --> 642.92]  So as the Lord has welcomed us and greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another this morning.
[642.92 --> 668.48]  Hey.
[668.48 --> 682.10]  All right. Good morning, everyone. Well, by design, you are the worship team today. Normally,
[682.24 --> 688.04]  we meet at quarter to nine, but we're making it 10 o'clock today and glad you could all be here. So
[688.04 --> 694.78]  we'll just enjoy the room singing together. I'll lead from here. And the first three songs we have,
[694.78 --> 701.96]  the first is an invitation to the Lord who is almighty to be here and to minister to us. And
[701.96 --> 708.28]  the second song says, here we are, and we're here to worship that God. And the third song is speak to
[708.28 --> 716.20]  us as we listen to your word, as we listen to scripture and the pastor. We're listening, speak to us. So
[716.20 --> 720.90]  that's the nature of our beginning today, starting with come now almighty King.
[720.90 --> 742.18]  help us thine name to sing. Help us to pray. Help us to pray. Help us to pray. Help us to pray. We're

[771.10 --> 776.18]  Turn up thy mighty sword
[776.18 --> 779.92]  Flatter thy foes
[779.92 --> 783.80]  Let thy almighty end
[783.80 --> 787.06]  Thy sure defense be made
[787.06 --> 789.92]  Thy soul from thee
[789.92 --> 793.84]  Take thy wonders show
[793.84 --> 800.24]  The holy God of your turn
[800.24 --> 805.32]  Thy sacred witness bear
[805.32 --> 809.06]  In this glad eye
[809.06 --> 813.06]  Thou who almighty are
[813.06 --> 816.60]  Rule thou in every heart
[816.60 --> 820.32]  And therefore, last in our
[820.32 --> 825.40]  Spirit of God

[830.48 --> 834.22]  Eternal praise
[834.22 --> 839.92]  And therefore, last in our
[839.92 --> 843.04]  Christ our good majesty
[843.04 --> 847.94]  May we in glory sing

[1219.70 --> 1221.70]  And the earth
[1221.70 --> 1222.70]  Is filled

[1224.70 --> 1225.70]  And the earth

[1241.70 --> 1242.70]  And the earth

[1243.70 --> 1244.70]  With your glory
[1244.70 --> 1247.70]  So our first reading
[1247.70 --> 1248.70]  This morning
[1248.70 --> 1250.70]  Is from 2 Kings
[1250.70 --> 1251.70]  Chapter 2
[1251.70 --> 1253.70]  We'll have the words
[1253.70 --> 1254.70]  On the screen
[1254.70 --> 1255.70]  If you'd like
[1255.70 --> 1256.70]  You can also follow along
[1256.70 --> 1257.70]  As I read
[1257.70 --> 1258.70]  From your pew bible
[1258.70 --> 1260.70]  This is on page 270
[1261.70 --> 1262.70]  In your pew bible
[1270.70 --> 1276.70]  So 2 Kings
[1276.70 --> 1279.70]  Chapter 2
[1279.70 --> 1280.70]  Verses 1
[1280.70 --> 1281.70]  Through 15
[1281.70 --> 1284.70]  When the Lord
[1284.70 --> 1285.70]  Was about to take
[1285.70 --> 1286.70]  Elijah up to heaven
[1286.70 --> 1287.70]  In a whirlwind
[1287.70 --> 1288.70]  Elijah
[1288.70 --> 1289.70]  And Elisha
[1289.70 --> 1291.70]  Were on their way
[1291.70 --> 1292.70]  From Gilgal
[1292.70 --> 1293.70]  Elisha
[1293.70 --> 1295.70]  Said to Elisha
[1295.70 --> 1296.70]  Sorry I'll keep
[1296.70 --> 1297.70]  Messing that up
[1297.70 --> 1298.70]  Elijah
[1298.70 --> 1299.70]  Said to Elisha
[1299.70 --> 1301.70]  Stay here
[1301.70 --> 1302.70]  The Lord
[1302.70 --> 1303.70]  Has sent me
[1303.70 --> 1304.70]  To Bethel
[1304.70 --> 1305.70]  But
[1305.70 --> 1306.70]  Elisha
[1306.70 --> 1307.70]  Said
[1307.70 --> 1308.70]  As surely
[1308.70 --> 1309.70]  As the Lord lives
[1309.70 --> 1310.70]  And as you live
[1310.70 --> 1311.70]  I will not leave you
[1311.70 --> 1312.70]  So they went
[1312.70 --> 1313.70]  Down to Bethel
[1313.70 --> 1314.70]  The company
[1314.70 --> 1315.70]  Of the prophets
[1315.70 --> 1316.70]  At Bethel
[1316.70 --> 1317.70]  Came out to Elisha
[1317.70 --> 1318.70]  And asked
[1318.70 --> 1319.70]  Do you know
[1319.70 --> 1320.70]  That the Lord
[1320.70 --> 1321.70]  Is going to take
[1321.70 --> 1322.70]  Your master
[1322.70 --> 1323.70]  From you today?
[1323.70 --> 1324.70]  Yes I know
[1324.70 --> 1325.70]  Elisha replied
[1325.70 --> 1327.70]  But do not speak of it
[1327.70 --> 1328.70]  Then Elisha said
[1328.70 --> 1329.70]  To him
[1329.70 --> 1331.70]  Stay here
[1331.70 --> 1332.70]  The Lord
[1332.70 --> 1333.70]  Has sent me
[1333.70 --> 1334.70]  To Jericho
[1334.70 --> 1335.70]  And he replied
[1335.70 --> 1336.70]  As surely
[1336.70 --> 1337.70]  As the Lord lives
[1337.70 --> 1338.70]  And as you live
[1338.70 --> 1339.70]  I will not leave you
[1339.70 --> 1340.70]  So they went
[1340.70 --> 1341.70]  To Jericho
[1341.70 --> 1342.70]  The company
[1342.70 --> 1343.70]  Of the prophets
[1343.70 --> 1344.70]  At Jericho
[1344.70 --> 1345.70]  Went up to Elisha
[1345.70 --> 1346.70]  And asked him
[1346.70 --> 1347.70]  Do you know
[1347.70 --> 1348.70]  That the Lord
[1348.70 --> 1349.70]  Is going to take
[1349.70 --> 1350.70]  Your master
[1350.70 --> 1351.70]  From you today?
[1351.70 --> 1352.70]  Yes I know
[1352.70 --> 1353.70]  He replied
[1353.70 --> 1354.70]  But do not speak of it
[1354.70 --> 1356.70]  Then Elijah said to him
[1356.70 --> 1357.70]  Stay here
[1357.70 --> 1358.70]  The Lord
[1358.70 --> 1359.70]  Has sent me
[1359.70 --> 1360.70]  To the Jordan
[1360.70 --> 1361.70]  And he replied
[1361.70 --> 1362.70]  As surely
[1362.70 --> 1363.70]  As the Lord lives
[1363.70 --> 1364.70]  And as you live
[1364.70 --> 1365.70]  I will not leave you
[1365.70 --> 1366.70]  So the two of them
[1366.70 --> 1367.70]  Walked on
[1367.70 --> 1369.70]  Fifty men
[1369.70 --> 1370.70]  Of the company
[1370.70 --> 1371.70]  Of the prophets
[1371.70 --> 1372.70]  Went and stood
[1372.70 --> 1373.70]  At a distance
[1373.70 --> 1374.70]  Facing the place
[1374.70 --> 1375.70]  Where Elijah
[1375.70 --> 1376.70]  And Elisha
[1376.70 --> 1377.70]  Had stopped
[1377.70 --> 1378.70]  At the Jordan
[1378.70 --> 1379.70]  Elijah took his cloak
[1379.70 --> 1380.70]  Rolled it up
[1380.70 --> 1381.70]  And struck the water
[1381.70 --> 1382.70]  The water divided
[1382.70 --> 1383.70]  To the right
[1383.70 --> 1384.70]  And to the left
[1384.70 --> 1385.70]  And the two of them
[1385.70 --> 1386.70]  Crossed over
[1386.70 --> 1387.70]  On dry ground
[1387.70 --> 1388.70]  When they had crossed
[1388.70 --> 1390.70]  Elijah said to Elisha
[1390.70 --> 1391.70]  Tell me
[1391.70 --> 1392.70]  What can I do for you
[1392.70 --> 1393.70]  Before I am taken
[1393.70 --> 1394.70]  From you?
[1394.70 --> 1395.70]  Let me inherit
[1395.70 --> 1396.70]  A double portion
[1396.70 --> 1397.70]  Of your spirit
[1397.70 --> 1399.70]  Elisha replied
[1399.70 --> 1400.70]  You have asked
[1400.70 --> 1401.70]  A difficult thing
[1401.70 --> 1402.70]  Elijah said
[1402.70 --> 1403.70]  Yet
[1403.70 --> 1404.70]  If you see me
[1404.70 --> 1405.70]  When I am taken
[1405.70 --> 1406.70]  From you
[1406.70 --> 1407.70]  It will be yours
[1407.70 --> 1408.70]  Otherwise not
[1408.70 --> 1410.70]  As they were walking
[1410.70 --> 1411.70]  Along and talking
[1411.70 --> 1412.70]  Together
[1412.70 --> 1413.70]  Suddenly
[1413.70 --> 1414.70]  A chariot of fire
[1414.70 --> 1416.70]  And horses of fire
[1416.70 --> 1417.70]  Appeared
[1417.70 --> 1418.70]  And separated
[1418.70 --> 1419.70]  The two of them
[1419.70 --> 1420.70]  And Elijah
[1420.70 --> 1421.70]  Went up to heaven
[1421.70 --> 1422.70]  In a whirlwind
[1422.70 --> 1423.70]  Elisha saw this
[1423.70 --> 1424.70]  And cried out
[1424.70 --> 1425.70]  My father
[1425.70 --> 1426.70]  My father
[1426.70 --> 1427.70]  The chariots
[1427.70 --> 1428.70]  And horsemen
[1428.70 --> 1429.70]  Of Israel
[1429.70 --> 1430.70]  And Elisha
[1430.70 --> 1431.70]  Saw him no more
[1431.70 --> 1433.70]  Then he took hold
[1433.70 --> 1434.70]  Of his own clothes
[1434.70 --> 1435.70]  And tore them apart
[1435.70 --> 1437.70]  He picked up the cloak
[1437.70 --> 1438.70]  That had fallen
[1438.70 --> 1439.70]  From Elijah
[1439.70 --> 1440.70]  And went back
[1440.70 --> 1441.70]  And stood on the bank
[1441.70 --> 1442.70]  Of the Jordan
[1442.70 --> 1443.70]  Then he took the cloak
[1443.70 --> 1444.70]  That had fallen
[1444.70 --> 1445.70]  From him
[1445.70 --> 1446.70]  And struck the water
[1446.70 --> 1447.70]  With it
[1447.70 --> 1448.70]  Where now is the Lord
[1448.70 --> 1450.70]  The God of Elijah
[1450.70 --> 1451.70]  He asked
[1451.70 --> 1453.70]  When he struck the water
[1453.70 --> 1454.70]  It divided
[1454.70 --> 1455.70]  To the right
[1455.70 --> 1456.70]  And to the left
[1456.70 --> 1458.70]  And he crossed over
[1458.70 --> 1460.70]  The company of the prophets
[1460.70 --> 1461.70]  From Jericho
[1461.70 --> 1462.70]  Who were watching said
[1462.70 --> 1464.70]  The spirit of Elijah
[1464.70 --> 1466.70]  Is resting on Elisha
[1466.70 --> 1468.70]  And they went to meet him
[1468.70 --> 1469.70]  And bowed to the ground
[1469.70 --> 1470.70]  Before him
[1470.70 --> 1472.70]  This is the word of the Lord
[1472.70 --> 1473.70]  Thanks be to God
[1473.70 --> 1477.70]  So we come now
[1477.70 --> 1479.70]  To a time of repentance
[1479.70 --> 1480.70]  And renewal
[1480.70 --> 1483.70]  And the way that often works
[1483.70 --> 1485.70]  Is that as we come before the Lord
[1485.70 --> 1486.70]  We hear his word read
[1486.70 --> 1487.70]  We sing praises to him
[1487.70 --> 1489.70]  We start to get a sense
[1489.70 --> 1491.70]  That he is good
[1491.70 --> 1492.70]  And holy
[1492.70 --> 1493.70]  And mighty
[1493.70 --> 1494.70]  And it is right
[1494.70 --> 1495.70]  That we worship him
[1495.70 --> 1496.70]  But so often
[1496.70 --> 1497.70]  We fail to worship him
[1497.70 --> 1499.70]  As he rightly deserves
[1499.70 --> 1500.70]  And we
[1500.70 --> 1501.70]  Ourselves
[1501.70 --> 1502.70]  Are sinners
[1502.70 --> 1503.70]  And that we do sin against him
[1503.70 --> 1505.70]  And we sin against one another
[1505.70 --> 1507.70]  And so we come before the Lord
[1507.70 --> 1509.70]  In this time of repentance
[1509.70 --> 1511.70]  A time of renewal
[1511.70 --> 1514.70]  Where we confess our sins before him
[1514.70 --> 1516.70]  And look to Jesus
[1516.70 --> 1517.70]  For his forgiveness
[1517.70 --> 1521.70]  So today I want to read
[1521.70 --> 1524.70]  From Matthew 22 here
[1524.70 --> 1525.70]  And this is going to be more of a
[1525.70 --> 1526.70]  A call to repentance
[1526.70 --> 1527.70]  A reminder of the law
[1527.70 --> 1528.70]  So to speak
[1528.70 --> 1531.70]  And then I will give you a time
[1531.70 --> 1533.70]  To reflect on this
[1533.70 --> 1534.70]  These words
[1534.70 --> 1535.70]  The great commandment
[1535.70 --> 1537.70]  And to think about the ways
[1537.70 --> 1539.70]  That you have failed to live up to it
[1539.70 --> 1541.70]  But also looking to Jesus for his mercy
[1541.70 --> 1545.70]  So let's hear this passage now
[1545.70 --> 1548.70]  Our Lord Jesus instructs us
[1548.70 --> 1549.70]  With these words
[1549.70 --> 1552.70]  You shall love the Lord your God
[1552.70 --> 1554.70]  With all of your heart
[1554.70 --> 1556.70]  With all of your soul
[1556.70 --> 1558.70]  And with all of your mind
[1558.70 --> 1560.70]  This is the great
[1560.70 --> 1562.70]  And first commandment
[1562.70 --> 1566.70]  As the Lord has instructed us
[1566.70 --> 1568.70]  As to what our deepest loyalty
[1568.70 --> 1570.70]  Should be to love him
[1570.70 --> 1572.70]  And because we have not
[1572.70 --> 1573.70]  Rightly loved him
[1573.70 --> 1575.70]  And lived up to this commandment
[1575.70 --> 1577.70]  Let us now confess our sins to God
[1577.70 --> 1580.70]  Trusting in Christ as our Savior
[1580.70 --> 1581.70]  And as our Lord
[1581.70 --> 1582.70]  So take some time now
[1582.70 --> 1584.70]  To silently confess your sins to God
[1584.70 --> 1586.70]  We fall through my sins
[1590.70 --> 1591.70]  So take more thoughts
[1591.70 --> 1592.70]  Lift it up, fold it up
[1592.70 --> 1593.70]  And take go
[1593.70 --> 1595.44]  That would you
[1596.56 --> 1597.62]  Which is hurt
[1597.62 --> 1599.70]  No one
[1599.70 --> 1619.82]  Heavenly Father, whenever we might get confused about what it means to live the Christian life,
[1619.82 --> 1624.76]  what does it mean to be a Christian, Lord, you remind us in these words to love the Lord your God
[1624.76 --> 1627.98]  with all of your heart and soul, mind and strength.
[1629.70 --> 1636.20]  And Lord, so with this before us, we do confess, Lord, that we often don't love you fully.
[1636.64 --> 1638.00]  Our hearts, our minds are divided.
[1639.60 --> 1642.48]  Often we serve ourselves and we do so at the expense of others.
[1643.62 --> 1646.14]  So Lord, would you renew us?
[1647.22 --> 1655.28]  Lord, we thank you that you come to us, even in our sin, because you love us and you have forgiven us.
[1655.28 --> 1665.76]  So Lord, would we not feel that we need to hide from you or that you don't love us
[1665.76 --> 1672.14]  and that you wouldn't look upon us because of our sin, but to remember that your grace is for us who are lowly
[1672.14 --> 1678.12]  and that you became lowly in humility to die for our sins and to rise again
[1678.12 --> 1683.98]  so that you have put our sins as far away from us as the east is from the west
[1683.98 --> 1687.62]  and so that we could have a renewed relationship with you.
[1688.58 --> 1692.10]  And so, Lord, help us live out of that relationship and help us to follow you
[1692.10 --> 1696.50]  as best as we can with your help, the Holy Spirit within us to love you.
[1697.02 --> 1698.74]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1698.74 --> 1706.66]  Now, the words of the gospel, the words of grace come to us from Titus 2.
[1707.14 --> 1709.32]  We'll read verses 11 to 13.
[1710.42 --> 1714.66]  For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
[1715.32 --> 1719.08]  It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions
[1719.08 --> 1724.28]  and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this present age
[1724.28 --> 1732.02]  while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[1733.04 --> 1737.44]  So, brothers and sisters, know that your sins are forgiven and be at peace.
[1738.10 --> 1744.46]  And as God has forgiven us, let us forgive others and show our repentance by our good works.
[1745.32 --> 1750.66]  So, let's stand now and let's sing of the forgiveness that we receive so freely in Christ.
[1751.08 --> 1753.70]  We'll stand and sing our next song, The River.
[1754.28 --> 1772.42]  To the river I am going
[1772.42 --> 1777.60]  Bringing sins I cannot bear
[1777.60 --> 1782.18]  Come and cleanse me
[1782.18 --> 1782.78]  Come and cleanse me
[1782.78 --> 1784.60]  Come and cleanse me
[1784.60 --> 1785.08]  Come and cleanse me
[1785.08 --> 1785.62]  Come and cleanse me
[1785.62 --> 1788.12]  Lord, I need me
[1788.12 --> 1788.88]  I need you
[1788.88 --> 1788.90]  Lord, I need you
[1788.90 --> 1789.68]  I need you
[1789.68 --> 1791.74]  I need you
[1791.74 --> 1794.82]  In these waters
[1794.82 --> 1798.06]  Healing mercy
[1798.06 --> 1801.06]  Close to freedom
[1801.06 --> 1803.06]  From despair
[1803.06 --> 1810.92]  I am going to the river
[1810.92 --> 1816.32]  Lord, I need you to then
[1816.32 --> 1823.70]  Precious Jesus, I am ready
[1823.70 --> 1829.42]  To surrender every care
[1829.42 --> 1835.90]  Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1835.90 --> 1842.54]  Lord, I need you to then
[1842.54 --> 1852.22]  Come and join us in the river
[1852.22 --> 1858.42]  Come from life, be our comfort there
[1858.42 --> 1864.90]  He is calling, He is waiting
[1864.90 --> 1870.42]  Jesus longs to meet you there
[1870.42 --> 1877.42]  He is calling, He is waiting
[1877.42 --> 1883.90]  Jesus longs to meet you there
[1883.90 --> 1889.42]  Precious Jesus, I am ready
[1889.42 --> 1895.90]  To surrender every care
[1895.90 --> 1902.42]  Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1902.42 --> 1907.90]  Lord, I need you there
[1907.90 --> 1915.42]  Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1915.42 --> 1921.90]  Lord, I need you there
[1921.90 --> 1926.90]  May we sing
[1926.90 --> 1939.98]  So our children will go now to their classes
[1939.98 --> 1941.32]  And the parents with them
[1941.32 --> 1942.86]  Not parents, teachers
[1942.86 --> 1955.34]  So while the children learn the Bible
[1955.34 --> 1958.92]  In a way that is easier for them to understand
[1958.92 --> 1959.52]  We will
[1959.52 --> 1962.48]  Maybe we should go with them
[1962.48 --> 1965.76]  But we will do our best here as well
[1965.76 --> 1968.30]  So good morning to you again
[1968.30 --> 1971.02]  Before we read our passage this morning
[1971.02 --> 1972.92]  I just want to orient you to where we are
[1972.92 --> 1975.08]  So we are in the season
[1975.08 --> 1976.30]  What season are we in?
[1977.26 --> 1977.98]  Easter, yeah
[1977.98 --> 1979.82]  Easter, sometimes called Eastertide
[1979.82 --> 1981.58]  And it is the season when the church
[1981.58 --> 1982.88]  Around the world
[1982.88 --> 1984.02]  Throughout the centuries
[1984.02 --> 1985.04]  Celebrates
[1985.04 --> 1987.48]  Jesus' resurrection life
[1987.48 --> 1989.32]  And what that life means
[1989.32 --> 1990.40]  For us
[1990.40 --> 1993.16]  And for actually all things
[1993.16 --> 1994.68]  Jesus' resurrection
[1994.68 --> 1998.46]  Is important for the resurrection
[1998.46 --> 1999.42]  Not only of us
[1999.42 --> 2001.02]  But also for his whole world
[2001.02 --> 2004.12]  So we have been in a sermon series
[2004.12 --> 2005.30]  That we have been calling
[2005.30 --> 2007.34]  Resurrection Presence
[2007.34 --> 2009.12]  And what we are doing is
[2009.12 --> 2010.54]  We are looking at those moments
[2010.54 --> 2013.48]  When Jesus comes to be with his disciples
[2013.48 --> 2017.10]  After he has rose again from the grave
[2017.10 --> 2019.88]  And he comes to be with his disciples
[2019.88 --> 2022.46]  In his risen, resurrected life
[2022.46 --> 2024.66]  And he comes to be with them
[2024.66 --> 2027.02]  In order to renew them
[2027.02 --> 2028.56]  In order to restore them
[2028.56 --> 2031.06]  And we have seen how Jesus has done that
[2031.06 --> 2032.14]  Over the last few weeks
[2032.14 --> 2033.46]  In some different ways
[2033.46 --> 2035.42]  He has restored them
[2035.42 --> 2037.04]  From fear to joy
[2037.04 --> 2040.38]  From confusion to clarity
[2040.38 --> 2043.06]  From doubt to faith
[2043.06 --> 2046.54]  From self-sufficiency to dependence on him
[2046.54 --> 2049.38]  And from failure to faithfulness
[2049.38 --> 2052.44]  Jesus has come to restore his disciples
[2052.44 --> 2055.18]  And today we come to a passage
[2055.18 --> 2059.60]  That addresses two of the most
[2059.60 --> 2061.12]  Kind of gripping issues
[2061.12 --> 2062.70]  Which all of us struggle with
[2062.70 --> 2065.46]  When it comes to following Jesus
[2065.46 --> 2066.64]  In this life
[2066.64 --> 2069.04]  And those two issues are
[2069.04 --> 2069.98]  Control
[2069.98 --> 2071.96]  And comparison
[2071.96 --> 2073.68]  Control
[2073.68 --> 2075.10]  We like to be in control
[2075.10 --> 2076.52]  Of our own lives
[2076.52 --> 2077.86]  And what it means to follow Jesus
[2077.86 --> 2079.98]  And we like to look around
[2079.98 --> 2081.48]  And compare our lives
[2081.48 --> 2083.40]  With other Christians
[2083.40 --> 2084.30]  With other churches
[2084.30 --> 2086.94]  And so these are two things
[2086.94 --> 2088.62]  That we actually struggle with
[2088.62 --> 2090.44]  As we follow Jesus
[2090.44 --> 2092.58]  And we are going to see in our passage
[2092.58 --> 2094.60]  How Jesus meets Peter
[2094.60 --> 2096.14]  In his struggles
[2096.14 --> 2097.64]  Because Peter is still struggling
[2097.64 --> 2100.02]  And he calls him
[2100.02 --> 2100.54]  And us
[2100.54 --> 2101.48]  Once again
[2101.48 --> 2103.76]  To wholeheartedly
[2103.76 --> 2105.94]  Follow Jesus
[2105.94 --> 2108.22]  So let's open our Bibles
[2108.22 --> 2108.70]  This morning
[2108.70 --> 2109.68]  And we are going to be again
[2109.68 --> 2111.28]  In John 21
[2111.28 --> 2112.24]  Chapter 21
[2112.24 --> 2113.18]  This is our third week
[2113.18 --> 2113.94]  In John 21
[2113.94 --> 2117.44]  And that is
[2117.44 --> 2119.00]  I'll have my bulletin
[2119.00 --> 2120.02]  You can see what page it is
[2120.02 --> 2120.80]  It should say there
[2120.80 --> 2121.60]  In the order of worship
[2121.60 --> 2123.70]  Oh I found it
[2123.70 --> 2124.98]  809
[2124.98 --> 2126.24]  Page 809
[2126.24 --> 2130.12]  And
[2130.12 --> 2131.58]  We will read
[2131.58 --> 2132.66]  Verses 18
[2132.66 --> 2134.14]  To 22
[2134.14 --> 2137.94]  John 21
[2137.94 --> 2138.92]  Verses 18
[2138.92 --> 2140.14]  To 22
[2140.14 --> 2141.58]  Let's give our attention
[2141.58 --> 2142.62]  To the reading of God's word
[2142.62 --> 2147.18]  I tell you the truth
[2147.18 --> 2149.34]  When you were younger
[2149.34 --> 2150.92]  You dressed yourself
[2150.92 --> 2152.30]  And went where you wanted
[2152.30 --> 2154.24]  But when you are old
[2154.24 --> 2155.88]  You will stretch out your hands
[2155.88 --> 2157.72]  And someone else will dress you
[2157.72 --> 2159.70]  And lead you where you do not want to go
[2159.70 --> 2162.08]  Jesus said this to indicate
[2162.08 --> 2163.00]  The kind of death
[2163.00 --> 2165.24]  By which Peter would glorify God
[2165.24 --> 2166.92]  Then he said to him
[2166.92 --> 2168.24]  Follow me
[2168.24 --> 2170.52]  Peter turned and saw
[2170.52 --> 2171.26]  That the disciple
[2171.26 --> 2172.40]  Whom Jesus loved
[2172.40 --> 2173.34]  Was following them
[2173.34 --> 2174.86]  This was the one
[2174.86 --> 2175.72]  Who had leaned back
[2175.72 --> 2176.60]  Against Jesus
[2176.60 --> 2177.22]  At the supper
[2177.22 --> 2178.30]  And had said
[2178.30 --> 2179.72]  Lord
[2179.72 --> 2181.44]  Who is going to betray you
[2181.44 --> 2183.88]  When Peter saw him
[2183.88 --> 2184.72]  He asked
[2184.72 --> 2186.12]  Lord what about him
[2186.12 --> 2188.08]  Jesus answered
[2188.08 --> 2190.12]  If I want him to remain alive
[2190.12 --> 2191.04]  Until I return
[2191.04 --> 2192.76]  What is that to you
[2192.76 --> 2194.02]  You
[2194.02 --> 2195.62]  Must follow me
[2195.62 --> 2197.42]  This is the word of the Lord
[2197.42 --> 2201.24]  And so let's pray together
[2201.24 --> 2202.52]  For God's blessing
[2202.52 --> 2204.00]  Upon his word
[2204.00 --> 2205.16]  Read and preached
[2205.16 --> 2205.74]  This morning
[2205.74 --> 2206.32]  Let's pray
[2206.32 --> 2207.92]  Our father
[2207.92 --> 2208.54]  We thank you
[2208.54 --> 2209.96]  For the truth of your word
[2209.96 --> 2211.94]  And we thank you
[2211.94 --> 2212.68]  For your love
[2212.68 --> 2213.22]  For us
[2213.22 --> 2214.66]  That is so clearly revealed
[2214.66 --> 2216.80]  In these pages of scripture
[2216.80 --> 2218.62]  And we pray this morning
[2218.62 --> 2219.42]  For your spirit
[2219.42 --> 2220.48]  To apply your word
[2220.48 --> 2221.20]  To our hearts
[2221.20 --> 2222.02]  And to our lives
[2222.02 --> 2223.16]  So that we
[2223.16 --> 2226.44]  Might be your faithful followers
[2226.44 --> 2227.78]  This day and always
[2227.78 --> 2229.70]  We pray in Christ's name
[2229.70 --> 2230.38]  Amen
[2230.38 --> 2234.50]  Now one of the interesting things
[2234.50 --> 2235.68]  About this passage
[2235.68 --> 2237.18]  Is that we have this
[2237.18 --> 2238.64]  Very unique conversation
[2238.64 --> 2240.92]  It's between Peter and Jesus
[2240.92 --> 2243.02]  And what's interesting
[2243.02 --> 2243.86]  Is that these are
[2243.86 --> 2245.02]  The very final words
[2245.56 --> 2247.78]  That the apostle John
[2247.78 --> 2249.52]  Records for us
[2249.52 --> 2251.14]  In the gospel of John
[2251.14 --> 2251.56]  This is
[2251.56 --> 2252.66]  He closes
[2252.66 --> 2253.58]  This is the finale
[2253.58 --> 2254.74]  He closes his gospel
[2254.74 --> 2255.84]  With this conversation
[2255.84 --> 2258.40]  And so we have to say
[2258.40 --> 2261.32]  Well why would this be recorded
[2261.32 --> 2262.76]  And what is so important
[2262.76 --> 2263.54]  About it
[2263.54 --> 2264.70]  What is the importance of it
[2264.70 --> 2266.78]  And you'll notice
[2266.78 --> 2269.18]  That twice in this passage
[2269.18 --> 2270.28]  Jesus says to Peter
[2270.28 --> 2271.50]  Follow me
[2271.50 --> 2272.28]  Right
[2272.28 --> 2273.28]  He says follow me
[2273.28 --> 2274.60]  Follow me
[2274.60 --> 2276.28]  So it appears that Peter
[2276.28 --> 2277.64]  Still needs to be
[2277.64 --> 2278.40]  Restored
[2278.40 --> 2279.92]  In some ways
[2279.92 --> 2281.02]  He needs to be restored
[2281.02 --> 2282.54]  To truly
[2282.54 --> 2284.60]  Really following Jesus
[2284.60 --> 2285.94]  Before Jesus
[2285.94 --> 2287.48]  Will then entrust Peter
[2287.48 --> 2288.90]  With the leadership
[2288.90 --> 2290.04]  Of the early church
[2290.04 --> 2291.70]  Before Jesus ascends
[2291.70 --> 2292.24]  Into heaven
[2292.24 --> 2294.86]  And so as I mentioned
[2294.86 --> 2295.50]  Already
[2295.50 --> 2297.28]  The final two things
[2297.28 --> 2298.30]  That Peter is still
[2298.30 --> 2299.30]  Struggling with
[2299.30 --> 2300.96]  Are control
[2300.96 --> 2302.46]  And comparison
[2302.46 --> 2304.16]  And so let's look
[2304.16 --> 2304.86]  At this passage
[2304.86 --> 2306.00]  And see how Jesus
[2306.00 --> 2306.66]  Addresses
[2306.66 --> 2308.12]  These issues
[2308.12 --> 2309.34]  In Peter's life
[2309.34 --> 2310.94]  And in our own lives
[2310.94 --> 2311.46]  Because again
[2311.46 --> 2311.98]  This is something
[2311.98 --> 2312.82]  That we also
[2312.82 --> 2313.74]  Struggle with
[2313.74 --> 2315.48]  And so I have two points
[2315.48 --> 2316.20]  For us this morning
[2316.20 --> 2317.40]  Number one
[2317.40 --> 2319.38]  Renouncing control
[2319.38 --> 2320.36]  Or
[2320.36 --> 2322.14]  To say
[2322.14 --> 2323.18]  God loves
[2323.18 --> 2323.90]  To work through
[2323.90 --> 2324.72]  Our weakness
[2324.72 --> 2326.42]  And then number two
[2326.42 --> 2326.86]  We'll see
[2326.86 --> 2328.18]  Renouncing comparison
[2328.18 --> 2330.06]  In how each disciple
[2330.06 --> 2330.94]  Has their own story
[2330.94 --> 2332.08]  Okay so that's our outline
[2332.08 --> 2332.68]  For those of you
[2332.68 --> 2333.28]  Who might want to
[2333.28 --> 2334.18]  Write these things down
[2334.18 --> 2334.82]  Or take notes
[2334.82 --> 2336.48]  It's okay if you don't
[2336.48 --> 2337.28]  But this is where
[2337.28 --> 2337.88]  We're going to go
[2337.88 --> 2338.92]  Renouncing control
[2338.92 --> 2340.52]  Renouncing comparison
[2340.52 --> 2341.76]  So first
[2341.76 --> 2342.90]  Renouncing control
[2342.90 --> 2344.12]  And how God loves
[2344.12 --> 2344.68]  To work
[2344.68 --> 2346.00]  Through our weakness
[2346.00 --> 2348.38]  So Peter's struggle
[2348.38 --> 2349.20]  Is this
[2349.20 --> 2350.36]  Peter
[2350.36 --> 2352.28]  Wants to follow Jesus
[2352.28 --> 2354.32]  But he wants to do it
[2354.32 --> 2356.02]  On his own terms
[2356.02 --> 2358.68]  He wants to have a say
[2358.68 --> 2359.52]  In the shape
[2359.52 --> 2360.62]  That following Jesus
[2360.62 --> 2362.00]  Is going to take
[2362.00 --> 2364.10]  He wants to have a say
[2364.10 --> 2365.24]  In what Jesus
[2365.24 --> 2366.30]  Is going to do
[2366.30 --> 2367.64]  And what his mission is
[2367.64 --> 2370.84]  So if you remember
[2370.84 --> 2371.92]  Peter's story
[2371.92 --> 2374.04]  Peter has become
[2374.04 --> 2375.04]  Convinced
[2375.04 --> 2376.52]  That Jesus is the king
[2376.52 --> 2377.00]  Right
[2377.00 --> 2378.20]  Jesus is the long
[2378.20 --> 2379.24]  Awaited Messiah
[2379.24 --> 2380.62]  Who is going to come
[2380.62 --> 2381.80]  And he's going to bring
[2381.80 --> 2383.20]  The kingdom of God
[2383.20 --> 2384.74]  To the world again
[2384.74 --> 2386.32]  Peter believes this
[2386.32 --> 2388.42]  And so Peter becomes
[2388.42 --> 2389.10]  One of Jesus'
[2389.40 --> 2390.50]  Most visible
[2390.50 --> 2392.32]  And enthusiastic followers
[2392.32 --> 2394.86]  But Peter also
[2394.86 --> 2396.58]  Had his own ideas
[2396.58 --> 2398.90]  About what all of this meant
[2398.90 --> 2400.58]  What this kingdom of God
[2400.58 --> 2401.08]  Would look like
[2401.08 --> 2402.14]  What kind of savior
[2402.14 --> 2402.70]  Messiah
[2402.70 --> 2404.08]  Jesus would be
[2404.08 --> 2405.88]  And in the midst
[2405.88 --> 2406.72]  Of their friendship
[2406.72 --> 2410.06]  They have this one conflict
[2410.06 --> 2412.96]  Over and over again
[2412.96 --> 2414.56]  And it was this
[2414.56 --> 2416.60]  Whenever Jesus was talking
[2416.60 --> 2417.58]  About his kingdom
[2417.58 --> 2419.60]  He also started
[2419.60 --> 2420.46]  Talking about
[2420.46 --> 2421.12]  Suffering
[2421.12 --> 2422.40]  And death
[2422.40 --> 2424.00]  And this drove
[2424.00 --> 2425.56]  Peter absolutely crazy
[2425.56 --> 2427.20]  And every time
[2427.20 --> 2428.24]  Jesus brings it up
[2428.24 --> 2429.62]  Peter confronts him
[2429.62 --> 2430.06]  About it
[2430.06 --> 2431.54]  Like every single time
[2431.54 --> 2433.10]  So for example
[2433.10 --> 2434.56]  In Matthew chapter 16
[2434.56 --> 2436.30]  Jesus has just told
[2436.30 --> 2437.02]  His followers
[2437.02 --> 2437.72]  That he's going to go
[2437.72 --> 2438.38]  To Jerusalem
[2438.38 --> 2439.78]  Where he's going to suffer
[2439.78 --> 2441.14]  And he's going to die
[2441.14 --> 2442.78]  And Peter says
[2442.78 --> 2444.46]  And it says
[2444.46 --> 2445.88]  Peter took him aside
[2445.88 --> 2447.54]  And began to rebuke him
[2447.54 --> 2448.82]  Never Lord
[2448.82 --> 2449.66]  He said
[2449.66 --> 2451.02]  This shall never
[2451.02 --> 2452.10]  Happen to you
[2452.10 --> 2453.82]  See Peter's just
[2453.82 --> 2455.42]  Getting up in Jesus' face
[2455.42 --> 2456.34]  All the time
[2456.34 --> 2457.08]  About this
[2457.08 --> 2459.52]  Peter argues with Jesus
[2459.52 --> 2461.28]  Because he wants
[2461.28 --> 2462.12]  To follow Jesus
[2462.12 --> 2464.04]  But he doesn't always
[2464.04 --> 2465.20]  Agree with Jesus
[2465.20 --> 2466.60]  He doesn't always
[2466.60 --> 2467.44]  Understand
[2467.44 --> 2469.64]  What Jesus is doing
[2469.64 --> 2471.80]  Peter wants Jesus
[2471.80 --> 2472.66]  To bring the kingdom
[2472.66 --> 2473.24]  Of God
[2473.24 --> 2475.10]  With power
[2475.10 --> 2476.54]  With victory
[2476.54 --> 2477.58]  And might
[2477.58 --> 2479.24]  He didn't want to hear
[2479.24 --> 2480.42]  All this nonsense
[2480.42 --> 2481.90]  About suffering
[2481.90 --> 2483.36]  And dying
[2483.36 --> 2485.40]  And so in the gospel
[2485.40 --> 2485.98]  Of John
[2485.98 --> 2487.76]  In the last days
[2487.76 --> 2488.72]  The final days
[2488.72 --> 2489.48]  Before Jesus
[2489.48 --> 2490.28]  Is arrested
[2490.28 --> 2491.56]  And crucified
[2491.56 --> 2493.32]  We see this argument
[2493.32 --> 2494.86]  That Peter's always
[2494.86 --> 2495.64]  Having with Jesus
[2495.64 --> 2496.82]  We see it play out
[2496.82 --> 2497.58]  In a couple ways
[2497.58 --> 2498.96]  So remember
[2498.96 --> 2499.66]  When they're in the
[2499.66 --> 2500.20]  Upper room
[2500.20 --> 2500.86]  It's the Passover
[2500.86 --> 2501.38]  They're going to
[2501.38 --> 2502.48]  Celebrate the Passover
[2502.48 --> 2502.90]  Meal
[2502.90 --> 2504.52]  Jesus with his disciples
[2504.52 --> 2506.02]  Do you remember
[2506.02 --> 2507.12]  What does Jesus do?
[2507.74 --> 2508.38]  He does something
[2508.38 --> 2509.18]  Super awkward
[2509.18 --> 2511.54]  He takes off his cloak
[2511.54 --> 2513.02]  He ties a towel
[2513.02 --> 2514.18]  Around his waist
[2514.18 --> 2516.16]  And he is going to
[2516.16 --> 2517.82]  Wash his disciples
[2517.82 --> 2519.76]  Feet like a servant
[2519.76 --> 2522.80]  And what does Peter say?
[2523.80 --> 2524.38]  He says
[2524.38 --> 2525.42]  No
[2525.42 --> 2527.74]  You are not going
[2527.74 --> 2528.92]  To wash my feet Jesus
[2528.92 --> 2530.82]  You are a king
[2530.82 --> 2531.92]  Stop
[2531.92 --> 2533.66]  With this servant stuff
[2533.66 --> 2535.56]  And then when they
[2535.56 --> 2537.24]  Leave the supper
[2537.24 --> 2537.82]  They go up to the
[2537.82 --> 2538.56]  Mount of Olives
[2538.56 --> 2539.58]  The soldiers come
[2539.58 --> 2540.38]  To arrest Jesus
[2540.38 --> 2541.14]  What does Peter do?
[2541.44 --> 2542.80]  He whips out his sword
[2542.80 --> 2544.04]  And he's waving it around
[2544.04 --> 2545.26]  And Jesus has to tell him
[2545.26 --> 2547.00]  Put the sword away
[2547.00 --> 2549.20]  And then when Jesus
[2549.20 --> 2549.88]  Is arrested
[2549.88 --> 2550.50]  Right
[2550.50 --> 2551.38]  When the suffering
[2551.38 --> 2551.94]  Came
[2551.94 --> 2553.38]  And all of Peter's
[2553.38 --> 2553.92]  Worst
[2553.92 --> 2555.30]  Nightmares
[2555.30 --> 2556.08]  Are coming
[2556.08 --> 2557.20]  To happen
[2557.20 --> 2558.78]  Death is leaning
[2558.78 --> 2559.22]  In
[2559.22 --> 2560.42]  That was it
[2560.42 --> 2560.92]  For Peter
[2560.92 --> 2562.16]  It was all over
[2562.16 --> 2562.94]  He denied
[2562.94 --> 2563.62]  He even knew
[2563.62 --> 2564.26]  This Jesus
[2564.26 --> 2565.28]  And he left
[2565.28 --> 2566.24]  He fled
[2566.24 --> 2567.38]  He denied
[2567.38 --> 2567.80]  Jesus
[2567.80 --> 2568.76]  And he fled
[2568.76 --> 2570.76]  Why would Peter
[2570.76 --> 2571.36]  Do that?
[2572.24 --> 2573.44]  Because he wanted
[2573.44 --> 2574.40]  To follow Jesus
[2574.40 --> 2575.64]  On his own terms
[2575.64 --> 2576.80]  He wanted to be
[2576.80 --> 2577.60]  In control
[2577.60 --> 2578.54]  Of what that
[2578.54 --> 2579.38]  Looked like
[2579.38 --> 2581.14]  And what was
[2581.14 --> 2581.72]  Going to happen
[2581.72 --> 2582.76]  And Jesus
[2582.76 --> 2583.52]  Getting arrested
[2583.52 --> 2584.30]  By the Romans
[2584.30 --> 2585.38]  And crucified
[2585.38 --> 2587.18]  Nailed to a cross
[2587.18 --> 2588.00]  Was not what
[2588.00 --> 2589.14]  Peter had in mind
[2589.14 --> 2590.80]  So when it comes
[2590.80 --> 2591.50]  Down to it
[2591.50 --> 2592.34]  When it came down
[2592.34 --> 2592.62]  To it
[2592.62 --> 2593.72]  Peter was out
[2593.72 --> 2594.92]  And he's like
[2594.92 --> 2595.62]  This is not
[2595.62 --> 2596.52]  What I signed up for
[2596.52 --> 2598.96]  Okay
[2598.96 --> 2599.48]  So now
[2599.48 --> 2600.66]  Let's fast forward
[2600.66 --> 2601.36]  A couple days
[2601.36 --> 2603.60]  Jesus is now
[2603.60 --> 2605.00]  After being crucified
[2605.00 --> 2606.56]  He's risen from the dead
[2606.56 --> 2607.18]  Right
[2607.18 --> 2608.16]  He is victorious
[2608.16 --> 2609.70]  Over sin and death
[2609.70 --> 2610.44]  Our true enemies
[2610.44 --> 2612.86]  He comes to Peter
[2612.86 --> 2614.46]  Who is just
[2614.46 --> 2615.16]  Absolutely
[2615.16 --> 2617.32]  Submerged in shame
[2617.32 --> 2619.10]  And Jesus
[2619.10 --> 2619.56]  And it's just
[2619.56 --> 2620.54]  Most incredible
[2620.54 --> 2622.12]  In his kindness
[2622.12 --> 2623.02]  His mercy
[2623.02 --> 2623.72]  His love
[2623.72 --> 2624.80]  He begins to
[2624.80 --> 2626.20]  Reconcile their relationship
[2626.20 --> 2627.46]  He begins to
[2627.46 --> 2628.40]  Restore Peter
[2628.40 --> 2628.94]  Back
[2628.94 --> 2629.74]  To again
[2629.74 --> 2631.06]  Working for his kingdom
[2631.06 --> 2632.74]  In the verses
[2632.74 --> 2633.64]  Right before
[2633.64 --> 2634.74]  Our passage
[2634.74 --> 2636.24]  They're marvelous
[2636.24 --> 2636.96]  We looked at them
[2636.96 --> 2637.52]  Last week
[2637.52 --> 2637.90]  You know
[2637.90 --> 2638.76]  Jesus is like
[2638.76 --> 2639.58]  Peter
[2639.58 --> 2640.56]  Do you love me?
[2640.92 --> 2641.44]  And Peter says
[2641.44 --> 2642.08]  Lord you know
[2642.08 --> 2642.78]  That I love you
[2642.78 --> 2643.42]  And Jesus says
[2643.42 --> 2644.36]  Feed my sheep
[2644.36 --> 2645.78]  And it's this moment
[2645.78 --> 2646.66]  That is so intimate
[2646.66 --> 2647.70]  And it's just like
[2647.70 --> 2648.54]  Totally vulnerable
[2648.54 --> 2650.24]  And their friendship
[2650.24 --> 2651.20]  Is being restored
[2651.20 --> 2651.86]  And they're sitting
[2651.86 --> 2653.04]  In this quiet moment
[2653.04 --> 2654.18]  On the beach
[2654.18 --> 2655.50]  The sun is rising
[2655.50 --> 2657.10]  And then
[2657.10 --> 2658.72]  Jesus
[2658.72 --> 2659.92]  In verse 18
[2659.92 --> 2661.74]  Says this
[2661.74 --> 2663.76]  Very truly
[2663.76 --> 2664.64]  Very truly I tell you
[2664.64 --> 2665.86]  When you were younger
[2665.86 --> 2667.04]  You dressed yourself
[2667.04 --> 2668.28]  And went where you wanted
[2668.28 --> 2669.50]  But when you are older
[2669.50 --> 2670.38]  You will stretch out
[2670.38 --> 2670.96]  Your hands
[2670.96 --> 2671.88]  And someone else
[2671.88 --> 2672.54]  Will dress you
[2672.54 --> 2673.64]  And lead you
[2673.64 --> 2674.82]  Where you do not
[2674.82 --> 2675.44]  Want to go
[2675.44 --> 2677.46]  Okay
[2677.46 --> 2678.86]  Does anybody think
[2678.86 --> 2679.56]  That's kind of like
[2679.56 --> 2681.04]  An abrupt mood kill?
[2681.48 --> 2682.72]  Like all of a sudden
[2682.72 --> 2683.36]  Jesus
[2683.36 --> 2684.32]  Is just like
[2684.32 --> 2686.14]  And you will be crucified
[2686.14 --> 2687.78]  Right
[2687.78 --> 2688.90]  Just a moment ago
[2688.90 --> 2690.32]  They're talking about love
[2690.32 --> 2692.00]  They're talking about lambs
[2692.00 --> 2693.08]  All of this stuff
[2693.08 --> 2694.56]  And now Jesus
[2694.56 --> 2695.44]  Again
[2695.44 --> 2697.00]  Is talking about
[2697.00 --> 2698.02]  Death and suffering
[2698.02 --> 2701.16]  What is Jesus doing here?
[2701.96 --> 2702.76]  What he's doing
[2702.76 --> 2704.54]  Is he's doing
[2704.54 --> 2705.52]  What he's always done
[2705.52 --> 2706.06]  With Peter
[2706.06 --> 2707.60]  But now
[2707.60 --> 2708.48]  At the beginning
[2708.48 --> 2709.04]  Of this new
[2709.04 --> 2710.06]  Restored relationship
[2710.06 --> 2710.96]  He's saying
[2710.96 --> 2711.78]  Peter I'm going to
[2711.78 --> 2712.40]  Tell you again
[2712.40 --> 2713.34]  What I've been telling you
[2713.34 --> 2713.94]  All along
[2713.94 --> 2715.70]  If you follow me
[2715.70 --> 2717.22]  If you love me
[2717.22 --> 2718.34]  If you will feed my sheep
[2718.34 --> 2720.22]  You are not going to do it
[2720.22 --> 2721.10]  On your terms
[2721.10 --> 2723.50]  But on my terms
[2723.50 --> 2724.34]  Okay
[2724.34 --> 2725.86]  You are not in control
[2725.86 --> 2727.30]  Of what following me
[2727.30 --> 2728.38]  Looks like
[2728.38 --> 2729.40]  In your life
[2729.40 --> 2731.68]  And if you follow me
[2731.68 --> 2733.42]  You must take up your cross
[2733.42 --> 2734.86]  Quite literally
[2734.86 --> 2736.06]  In Peter's case
[2736.06 --> 2737.56]  And follow me
[2737.56 --> 2739.98]  And it is going to mean suffering
[2739.98 --> 2743.90]  But then look at this
[2743.90 --> 2745.06]  Comment that
[2745.06 --> 2746.28]  John the writer
[2746.28 --> 2747.44]  Inserts here
[2747.44 --> 2748.84]  In verse 19
[2748.84 --> 2749.88]  He says
[2749.88 --> 2750.82]  Jesus said this
[2750.82 --> 2751.52]  To indicate
[2751.52 --> 2752.42]  The kind of death
[2752.42 --> 2753.14]  By which Peter
[2753.14 --> 2754.74]  Would glorify God
[2754.74 --> 2756.42]  Then he said to him
[2756.42 --> 2757.18]  Follow me
[2757.18 --> 2758.76]  Okay
[2758.76 --> 2759.72]  So Jesus is saying
[2759.72 --> 2760.66]  Peter I know
[2760.66 --> 2761.62]  That you want
[2761.62 --> 2762.98]  To glorify God
[2762.98 --> 2764.52]  I mean that's what
[2764.52 --> 2766.32]  Peter's driving passion is
[2766.32 --> 2766.70]  He wants
[2766.70 --> 2768.40]  The glory of God
[2768.40 --> 2768.56]  Right
[2768.56 --> 2769.66]  But he wanted it
[2769.66 --> 2770.48]  In a different way
[2770.48 --> 2773.06]  And Jesus is saying
[2773.06 --> 2774.60]  My plan for your life
[2774.60 --> 2776.60]  What will most glorify me
[2776.60 --> 2777.82]  Is going to be
[2777.82 --> 2778.66]  Through your suffering
[2778.66 --> 2779.66]  And through your weakness
[2779.66 --> 2781.94]  And that's just
[2781.94 --> 2782.54]  A complete
[2782.54 --> 2784.40]  Shift that Peter
[2784.40 --> 2785.04]  Has to make
[2785.04 --> 2785.50]  In his heart
[2785.50 --> 2786.26]  And in his mind
[2786.26 --> 2788.82]  And so what I want us
[2788.82 --> 2789.58]  To see is that
[2789.58 --> 2790.88]  Jesus is once again
[2790.88 --> 2791.56]  Inviting
[2791.56 --> 2792.58]  Peter
[2792.58 --> 2793.90]  Into his life
[2793.90 --> 2795.06]  But the heart
[2795.06 --> 2796.00]  Of that invitation
[2796.00 --> 2797.24]  For Peter
[2797.24 --> 2798.00]  And for us
[2798.00 --> 2799.24]  Is the fact that
[2799.24 --> 2800.70]  Jesus doesn't work
[2800.70 --> 2801.12]  For you
[2801.12 --> 2802.58]  Right
[2802.58 --> 2803.24]  He doesn't work
[2803.24 --> 2803.76]  For me
[2803.76 --> 2805.44]  He leads
[2805.44 --> 2806.96]  He is in charge
[2806.96 --> 2808.00]  And we follow
[2808.00 --> 2809.82]  And we submit
[2809.82 --> 2811.24]  What we think
[2811.24 --> 2812.10]  To his will
[2812.10 --> 2813.88]  And that means
[2813.88 --> 2814.52]  Letting go
[2814.52 --> 2815.12]  Of control
[2815.12 --> 2816.88]  Of what our lives
[2816.88 --> 2817.60]  Will look like
[2817.60 --> 2818.96]  And I know
[2818.96 --> 2819.60]  That is hard
[2819.60 --> 2820.80]  It's hard for me
[2820.80 --> 2822.30]  And it feels
[2822.30 --> 2822.88]  Very scary
[2822.88 --> 2823.40]  To say
[2823.40 --> 2824.26]  I don't get to be
[2824.26 --> 2825.34]  In charge of my own life
[2825.34 --> 2827.44]  Because naturally
[2827.44 --> 2829.58]  We want to be
[2829.58 --> 2830.78]  In charge of our lives
[2830.78 --> 2831.36]  We want to be
[2831.36 --> 2831.90]  In control
[2831.90 --> 2833.20]  But if Jesus
[2833.20 --> 2833.94]  Is Lord
[2833.94 --> 2835.10]  And he's the one
[2835.10 --> 2835.84]  Leading my life
[2835.84 --> 2836.64]  It also means
[2836.64 --> 2837.42]  That like Peter
[2837.42 --> 2839.02]  I have to give up
[2839.02 --> 2839.92]  My idea
[2839.92 --> 2841.62]  Even of
[2841.62 --> 2843.42]  My usefulness
[2843.42 --> 2844.56]  To the Lord
[2844.56 --> 2846.38]  Like my desire
[2846.38 --> 2847.30]  To glorify God
[2847.30 --> 2848.32]  To be useful to God
[2848.32 --> 2849.30]  And live for his glory
[2849.30 --> 2850.82]  I have to become
[2850.82 --> 2851.80]  Actually a little bit
[2851.80 --> 2852.70]  Useless to God
[2852.70 --> 2854.02]  So to speak
[2854.02 --> 2856.14]  But that's the opposite
[2856.14 --> 2857.16]  Of what we usually think
[2857.16 --> 2857.64]  Which is that
[2857.64 --> 2858.74]  In order to glorify God
[2858.74 --> 2859.28]  In my life
[2859.28 --> 2861.06]  I need to be able to lead
[2861.06 --> 2863.12]  I need to be strong
[2863.12 --> 2864.36]  I need to be kind of successful
[2864.36 --> 2866.12]  I need to at least
[2866.12 --> 2867.28]  Not be so weak
[2867.28 --> 2868.52]  And so failing
[2868.52 --> 2869.72]  All the time
[2869.72 --> 2870.90]  The way I often feel
[2870.90 --> 2872.86]  We struggle with this
[2872.86 --> 2874.34]  We want to glorify God
[2874.34 --> 2875.20]  But we feel so weak
[2875.20 --> 2876.52]  And how can we glorify God
[2876.52 --> 2877.72]  In our sin
[2877.72 --> 2878.32]  In our weakness
[2878.32 --> 2879.18]  Our brokenness
[2879.18 --> 2879.80]  Our struggles
[2879.80 --> 2880.56]  That we have
[2880.56 --> 2884.12]  But that is just
[2884.12 --> 2884.76]  The attitude
[2884.76 --> 2886.56]  That we struggle with too
[2886.56 --> 2887.80]  That Peter needs to be
[2887.80 --> 2889.42]  Restored from
[2889.42 --> 2891.60]  And if he is going to learn
[2891.60 --> 2892.38]  To truly be
[2892.38 --> 2893.28]  The Lord's disciple
[2893.28 --> 2895.28]  He needs to realize
[2895.28 --> 2896.56]  That it's not his gifts
[2896.56 --> 2897.60]  It's not his strengths
[2897.60 --> 2898.32]  It's not his
[2898.32 --> 2899.98]  Having his life together
[2899.98 --> 2901.54]  That the Lord wants
[2901.54 --> 2903.14]  It is
[2903.14 --> 2904.92]  Our love for him
[2904.92 --> 2906.50]  And our willingness
[2906.50 --> 2908.24]  To let go of control
[2908.24 --> 2908.88]  Of our lives
[2908.88 --> 2910.24]  And to follow him
[2910.24 --> 2913.36]  So I want to share
[2913.36 --> 2914.28]  This story with you
[2914.28 --> 2915.34]  I think it's a great story
[2915.34 --> 2917.44]  So in Buenos Aires
[2917.44 --> 2918.98]  Argentina
[2918.98 --> 2921.38]  There is an Anglican
[2921.38 --> 2922.46]  Archbishop
[2922.46 --> 2923.48]  By the name of
[2923.48 --> 2924.56]  Gregory Venables
[2924.56 --> 2927.10]  So he was English
[2927.10 --> 2928.08]  His family was English
[2928.08 --> 2928.78]  But they lived in
[2928.78 --> 2929.40]  Buenos Aires
[2929.40 --> 2932.04]  And so as an English family
[2932.04 --> 2933.56]  They had English tea
[2933.56 --> 2934.96]  At four o'clock
[2934.96 --> 2935.48]  Every day
[2935.48 --> 2937.28]  One day when
[2937.28 --> 2939.22]  Gregory was a young boy
[2939.22 --> 2940.66]  He was getting the tea
[2940.66 --> 2941.44]  Ready for him
[2941.44 --> 2942.06]  With his mother
[2942.06 --> 2943.36]  And his mother
[2943.36 --> 2944.44]  Took a plate off
[2944.44 --> 2945.06]  A shelf
[2945.06 --> 2946.40]  And she was going
[2946.40 --> 2947.78]  To put some scones
[2947.78 --> 2948.46]  On it
[2948.46 --> 2949.04]  To go with the tea
[2949.04 --> 2950.70]  But the plate
[2950.70 --> 2951.96]  Had this big chip
[2951.96 --> 2952.38]  Right
[2952.38 --> 2952.96]  This big piece
[2952.96 --> 2953.98]  That was missing from it
[2953.98 --> 2955.12]  And so she said
[2955.12 --> 2955.34]  You know
[2955.34 --> 2956.42]  Gregory take this out
[2956.42 --> 2957.46]  And throw it away
[2957.46 --> 2958.52]  This plate is no longer
[2958.52 --> 2959.04]  Any good
[2959.04 --> 2962.32]  Thirty years later
[2962.32 --> 2963.32]  As the
[2963.32 --> 2964.66]  Now the Archbishop
[2964.66 --> 2965.44]  Of Argentina
[2965.44 --> 2967.10]  In the Anglican church
[2967.10 --> 2968.40]  He's going to one
[2968.40 --> 2969.34]  Of the remote churches
[2969.34 --> 2970.02]  In the mountains
[2970.02 --> 2970.78]  Of Argentina
[2970.78 --> 2971.90]  Where he now
[2971.90 --> 2972.50]  As a bishop
[2972.50 --> 2973.08]  Would go
[2973.08 --> 2974.18]  And minister
[2974.18 --> 2974.88]  To the people
[2974.88 --> 2975.44]  He would serve
[2975.44 --> 2976.06]  Them communion
[2976.06 --> 2978.64]  And as he picked up
[2978.64 --> 2979.12]  The bread
[2979.12 --> 2979.92]  Of the Lord's Supper
[2979.92 --> 2980.88]  And he broke the bread
[2980.88 --> 2981.44]  And he said
[2981.44 --> 2982.10]  Take eat
[2982.10 --> 2982.96]  This is my body
[2982.96 --> 2983.72]  Which is for you
[2983.72 --> 2985.16]  He looked down
[2985.16 --> 2987.12]  And the plate
[2987.12 --> 2988.06]  That the bread
[2988.06 --> 2988.90]  Had been on
[2988.90 --> 2990.42]  Was that very plate
[2990.42 --> 2992.02]  That he had thrown away
[2992.02 --> 2994.04]  Thirty years before
[2994.04 --> 2997.36]  And as he tells this story
[2997.36 --> 2998.88]  The lesson he drew
[2998.88 --> 2999.46]  From this
[2999.46 --> 3000.04]  Is to say
[3000.04 --> 3001.56]  That God takes
[3001.56 --> 3003.44]  What appears to be
[3003.44 --> 3004.44]  Useless
[3004.44 --> 3005.76]  And broken
[3005.76 --> 3006.62]  Right
[3006.62 --> 3007.28]  God takes
[3007.28 --> 3008.16]  What we would think
[3008.16 --> 3008.86]  Is weak
[3008.86 --> 3010.62]  And that we would
[3010.62 --> 3011.54]  Want to throw away
[3011.54 --> 3013.52]  And he uses it
[3013.52 --> 3015.46]  For the glory
[3015.46 --> 3016.48]  Of the one
[3016.48 --> 3017.16]  Who suffered
[3017.16 --> 3017.72]  It was broken
[3017.72 --> 3018.38]  For us
[3018.38 --> 3020.20]  That's what he says
[3020.20 --> 3022.24]  We serve a Christ
[3022.24 --> 3022.96]  Who suffered
[3022.96 --> 3023.72]  And died
[3023.72 --> 3026.48]  And he calls us
[3026.48 --> 3027.46]  To follow him
[3027.46 --> 3028.24]  In weakness
[3028.24 --> 3030.20]  And he reminds us
[3030.20 --> 3030.68]  Of that
[3030.68 --> 3032.30]  And so that's
[3032.30 --> 3033.02]  The first point
[3033.02 --> 3033.48]  That we see
[3033.48 --> 3034.28]  In these verses
[3034.28 --> 3035.50]  That following Jesus
[3035.50 --> 3036.48]  Means that we must
[3036.48 --> 3037.28]  Renounce control
[3037.28 --> 3037.92]  Of our lives
[3037.92 --> 3039.68]  So that he
[3039.68 --> 3040.76]  Could be glorified
[3040.76 --> 3041.56]  In us
[3041.56 --> 3043.94]  Do we want
[3043.94 --> 3044.90]  To glorify God
[3044.90 --> 3045.54]  In our lives
[3045.54 --> 3046.14]  Then we need
[3046.14 --> 3046.66]  To let go
[3046.66 --> 3047.18]  Of control
[3047.18 --> 3048.54]  Of what we think
[3048.54 --> 3049.52]  Our lives should look like
[3049.52 --> 3051.28]  And in our weakness
[3051.28 --> 3052.74]  Allow God to use us
[3052.74 --> 3056.50]  Now the second thing
[3056.50 --> 3057.62]  We're going to see
[3057.62 --> 3058.70]  Is how Jesus
[3058.70 --> 3059.82]  Then calls Peter
[3059.82 --> 3061.44]  Not only to
[3061.44 --> 3062.66]  Renounce control
[3062.66 --> 3064.62]  But to renounce
[3064.62 --> 3065.76]  Comparison
[3065.76 --> 3067.40]  And the lesson is
[3067.40 --> 3068.18]  That each disciple
[3068.18 --> 3069.34]  Has their own story
[3069.34 --> 3072.88]  So here's the scene
[3072.88 --> 3074.44]  Peter is now
[3074.44 --> 3075.62]  Walking with the Lord
[3075.62 --> 3076.16]  I don't know how
[3076.16 --> 3077.06]  That transition happened
[3077.06 --> 3077.44]  They were kind of
[3077.44 --> 3078.12]  Sitting by the fire
[3078.12 --> 3078.78]  But now maybe
[3078.78 --> 3079.34]  They got up
[3079.34 --> 3080.20]  They're going for a stroll
[3080.20 --> 3081.02]  So it says
[3081.02 --> 3081.84]  Peter is walking
[3081.84 --> 3082.44]  With the Lord
[3082.44 --> 3084.10]  And he turns
[3084.10 --> 3085.60]  And John is kind of
[3085.60 --> 3085.92]  Following
[3085.92 --> 3086.42]  They're all kind of
[3086.42 --> 3087.12]  Moving together
[3087.12 --> 3088.74]  He turns and sees John
[3088.74 --> 3089.74]  And he says
[3089.74 --> 3091.16]  Lord what about him
[3091.16 --> 3092.26]  What about this guy
[3092.26 --> 3093.46]  What is going to happen
[3093.46 --> 3094.38]  To him
[3094.38 --> 3096.92]  And Jesus' response
[3096.92 --> 3097.48]  Is I think
[3097.48 --> 3097.64]  You know
[3097.64 --> 3098.02]  It's kind of
[3098.02 --> 3099.10]  Very reassuring
[3099.10 --> 3100.64]  But it's actually
[3100.64 --> 3102.16]  A sharp rebuke
[3102.16 --> 3103.10]  You know
[3103.10 --> 3103.82]  If we think about
[3103.82 --> 3104.36]  All the
[3104.36 --> 3105.74]  Who gets the most rebukes
[3105.74 --> 3106.94]  In the gospels
[3106.94 --> 3107.60]  Well it's Peter
[3107.60 --> 3108.82]  And one last one
[3108.82 --> 3110.04]  Before the end of John
[3110.04 --> 3111.68]  And so
[3111.68 --> 3112.68]  In verse 22
[3112.68 --> 3114.44]  This is what it says
[3114.44 --> 3115.36]  Jesus answered
[3115.36 --> 3117.20]  If I want him
[3117.20 --> 3118.02]  To remain alive
[3118.02 --> 3118.92]  Until I return
[3118.92 --> 3120.74]  What is that to you
[3120.74 --> 3123.68]  You must follow me
[3123.68 --> 3125.26]  Right
[3125.26 --> 3126.44]  So Jesus here is saying
[3126.44 --> 3127.78]  Peter if I want
[3127.78 --> 3129.42]  John to continue living
[3129.42 --> 3131.96]  Until I return
[3131.96 --> 3132.60]  Or he's talking about
[3132.60 --> 3133.46]  His second coming
[3133.46 --> 3135.70]  What is that to you
[3135.70 --> 3137.06]  In other words
[3137.06 --> 3138.58]  What I do
[3138.58 --> 3139.70]  With John
[3139.70 --> 3141.60]  Is none of your business
[3141.60 --> 3142.24]  Peter
[3142.24 --> 3144.14]  So you see
[3144.14 --> 3144.98]  It's a rebuke
[3144.98 --> 3147.00]  Jesus is rebuking
[3147.00 --> 3147.94]  Peter for this question
[3147.94 --> 3149.02]  But why
[3149.02 --> 3150.82]  Why this rebuke
[3150.82 --> 3151.08]  Right
[3151.08 --> 3151.90]  You know
[3151.90 --> 3152.64]  When Thomas
[3152.64 --> 3153.82]  Had questions
[3153.82 --> 3155.54]  And was kind of
[3155.54 --> 3156.68]  Doubting of the resurrection
[3156.68 --> 3157.88]  Jesus comes to him
[3157.88 --> 3158.78]  In kindness
[3158.78 --> 3159.46]  And he says
[3159.46 --> 3160.06]  Put your finger
[3160.06 --> 3160.70]  In my side
[3160.70 --> 3161.50]  And he's very
[3161.50 --> 3162.26]  Accommodating
[3162.26 --> 3163.30]  To Thomas
[3163.30 --> 3164.92]  But here for Peter
[3164.92 --> 3166.74]  Peter gets a rebuke
[3166.74 --> 3169.92]  Now so what is wrong
[3169.92 --> 3170.92]  With Peter's question
[3170.92 --> 3171.98]  Well Thomas' question
[3171.98 --> 3173.02]  He was sincerely
[3173.02 --> 3174.10]  Seeking answers
[3174.10 --> 3174.44]  Right
[3174.44 --> 3175.78]  And
[3175.78 --> 3176.56]  But here
[3176.56 --> 3177.34]  Peter
[3177.34 --> 3179.46]  He's not
[3179.46 --> 3180.92]  He's comparing
[3180.92 --> 3181.46]  So
[3181.46 --> 3183.06]  And on one level
[3183.06 --> 3183.26]  You know
[3183.26 --> 3184.04]  This is very natural
[3184.04 --> 3184.60]  For us
[3184.60 --> 3186.18]  Peter is curious
[3186.18 --> 3187.26]  About John's fate
[3187.26 --> 3187.94]  Right
[3187.94 --> 3188.18]  I mean
[3188.18 --> 3188.82]  He's just been told
[3188.82 --> 3189.68]  That he's going to be crucified
[3189.68 --> 3191.14]  So like
[3191.14 --> 3191.94]  What about
[3191.94 --> 3192.78]  What about him
[3192.78 --> 3193.10]  Right
[3193.10 --> 3194.60]  Maybe Peter wonders
[3194.60 --> 3196.04]  If he is being singled out
[3196.04 --> 3196.76]  In some way
[3196.76 --> 3199.30]  But
[3199.30 --> 3200.80]  Implicit in the question
[3200.80 --> 3201.78]  What about him
[3201.78 --> 3203.58]  Is a comparison
[3203.58 --> 3205.74]  Peter is told
[3205.74 --> 3206.86]  How he's going to die
[3206.86 --> 3208.14]  He sees John
[3208.14 --> 3208.48]  And he asks
[3208.48 --> 3209.10]  What about him
[3209.10 --> 3209.78]  Because he wants
[3209.78 --> 3211.28]  To measure his life
[3211.28 --> 3213.22]  Against John's life
[3213.22 --> 3215.10]  And you see
[3215.10 --> 3215.74]  This is something
[3215.74 --> 3216.78]  That we all do
[3216.78 --> 3218.76]  Lord what about him
[3218.76 --> 3220.56]  Lord what about her
[3220.56 --> 3221.76]  Right
[3221.76 --> 3223.12]  It's something
[3223.12 --> 3223.74]  That not only
[3223.74 --> 3224.42]  Peter asks
[3224.42 --> 3225.78]  But that we all ask
[3225.78 --> 3228.70]  Because how do you know
[3228.70 --> 3229.64]  If you're doing well
[3229.64 --> 3230.82]  In life
[3230.82 --> 3231.76]  How do you know
[3231.76 --> 3233.16]  If your life is a success
[3233.16 --> 3234.54]  Or if it's a failure
[3234.54 --> 3236.40]  Well you look around
[3236.40 --> 3237.98]  And you compare
[3237.98 --> 3238.68]  Your life
[3238.68 --> 3239.54]  To other people
[3239.54 --> 3241.28]  And this is just
[3241.28 --> 3242.24]  Second nature for us
[3242.24 --> 3242.42]  Right
[3242.42 --> 3243.18]  We all do this
[3243.18 --> 3243.78]  We all make
[3243.78 --> 3244.90]  Comparisons
[3244.90 --> 3246.00]  Alright
[3246.00 --> 3246.74]  And that's why
[3246.74 --> 3247.14]  You know
[3247.14 --> 3247.96]  Taking us back
[3247.96 --> 3248.58]  To that story
[3248.58 --> 3250.04]  Of Elijah and Elisha
[3250.04 --> 3251.52]  That we read earlier
[3251.52 --> 3253.78]  Elijah is taken up
[3253.78 --> 3254.36]  Into heaven
[3254.36 --> 3255.68]  In a chariot of fire
[3255.68 --> 3257.00]  He's escaping death
[3257.00 --> 3258.54]  Going up to heaven
[3258.54 --> 3259.48]  In a whirlwind
[3259.48 --> 3260.74]  And Elisha
[3260.74 --> 3261.64]  He's like
[3261.64 --> 3262.42]  I will follow you
[3262.42 --> 3263.38]  Wherever you go
[3263.38 --> 3264.90]  I will follow you
[3264.90 --> 3265.56]  Wherever you go
[3265.56 --> 3267.34]  Can I go in the chariot too
[3267.34 --> 3268.14]  You know
[3268.14 --> 3269.26]  What about him
[3269.26 --> 3270.76]  I want to be like him
[3270.76 --> 3272.86]  But God does not
[3272.86 --> 3274.16]  Give to Elisha
[3274.16 --> 3275.10]  What he gave
[3275.10 --> 3276.38]  And granted to Elijah
[3276.38 --> 3277.78]  But instead
[3277.78 --> 3278.26]  He gave him
[3278.26 --> 3278.96]  Something different
[3278.96 --> 3280.28]  Which was a double
[3280.28 --> 3281.34]  Portion of the spirit
[3281.34 --> 3283.34]  And so one of the
[3283.34 --> 3284.06]  Points I think
[3284.06 --> 3285.14]  That Jesus is making
[3285.14 --> 3286.36]  In teaching us here
[3286.36 --> 3287.70]  Is that we are not
[3287.70 --> 3288.60]  All treated the same
[3288.60 --> 3289.68]  Okay
[3289.68 --> 3290.26]  We're not all
[3290.26 --> 3290.94]  Treated the same
[3290.94 --> 3292.88]  And the problem
[3292.88 --> 3293.62]  With comparing
[3293.62 --> 3294.98]  Your life
[3294.98 --> 3296.52]  With other people's
[3296.52 --> 3296.80]  Lives
[3296.80 --> 3297.86]  Is that it robs you
[3297.86 --> 3298.36]  Of joy
[3298.36 --> 3299.50]  Right
[3299.50 --> 3300.14]  You know that
[3300.14 --> 3300.98]  You experience that
[3300.98 --> 3301.88]  It robs you of joy
[3301.88 --> 3303.42]  Comparing yourself
[3303.42 --> 3304.56]  With others
[3304.56 --> 3305.44]  Works against
[3305.44 --> 3306.24]  Being content
[3306.24 --> 3308.26]  With what God
[3308.26 --> 3309.06]  Has given you
[3309.06 --> 3312.00]  You know
[3312.00 --> 3312.70]  Many of you
[3312.70 --> 3313.12]  Have heard me
[3313.12 --> 3313.88]  Share a little bit
[3313.88 --> 3314.96]  About the trip
[3314.96 --> 3315.90]  I was able to take
[3315.90 --> 3316.92]  To the Middle East
[3316.92 --> 3318.00]  And so we had
[3318.00 --> 3318.96]  A tour guide
[3318.96 --> 3319.96]  His name was George
[3319.96 --> 3321.10]  And George is a
[3321.10 --> 3321.86]  CRC pastor
[3321.86 --> 3322.48]  He's kind of
[3322.48 --> 3323.46]  I think he's retired now
[3323.46 --> 3325.24]  But he had
[3325.24 --> 3326.48]  What we became
[3326.48 --> 3326.90]  On the trip
[3326.90 --> 3328.14]  To called George-isms
[3328.14 --> 3330.12]  These turns of phrase
[3330.12 --> 3331.22]  That George would
[3331.22 --> 3332.06]  Just repeat
[3332.06 --> 3334.04]  One of them was
[3334.04 --> 3335.12]  We'd be going along
[3335.12 --> 3336.06]  Say what are we
[3336.06 --> 3336.42]  Going to do
[3336.42 --> 3336.90]  What's next
[3336.90 --> 3337.52]  He won't tell us
[3337.52 --> 3338.18]  But he'll say
[3338.18 --> 3339.22]  Let's see what
[3339.22 --> 3339.88]  The Lord gives
[3339.88 --> 3341.26]  Let's see what
[3341.26 --> 3341.98]  The Lord gives
[3341.98 --> 3343.90]  And he said this
[3343.90 --> 3344.66]  So often
[3344.66 --> 3345.50]  That it really
[3345.50 --> 3346.26]  Started to
[3346.26 --> 3347.20]  Kind of take root
[3347.20 --> 3348.26]  And I noticed it
[3348.26 --> 3348.80]  And I think it's
[3348.80 --> 3349.74]  Just such a lovely
[3349.74 --> 3350.92]  Turn of phrase
[3350.92 --> 3351.90]  Because the thing is
[3351.90 --> 3352.26]  You can have
[3352.26 --> 3353.06]  All these plans
[3353.06 --> 3353.52]  We're going to see
[3353.52 --> 3353.72]  This
[3353.72 --> 3354.40]  We're going to do this
[3354.40 --> 3355.30]  But we don't
[3355.30 --> 3355.94]  We don't know
[3355.94 --> 3356.36]  What the Lord
[3356.36 --> 3357.08]  Is going to give
[3357.08 --> 3359.14]  And so he would say
[3359.14 --> 3360.26]  Let's see what
[3360.26 --> 3360.86]  The Lord gives
[3360.86 --> 3361.42]  And I think that's
[3361.42 --> 3361.76]  Just something
[3361.76 --> 3362.54]  That we can take
[3362.54 --> 3363.38]  Into our own lives
[3363.38 --> 3364.14]  As we go about
[3364.14 --> 3364.62]  Our lives
[3364.62 --> 3365.82]  Let's see what
[3365.82 --> 3366.54]  The Lord gives
[3366.54 --> 3367.82]  Because we don't know
[3367.82 --> 3369.92]  And there's a
[3369.92 --> 3370.80]  Second turn of phrase
[3370.80 --> 3371.62]  That I love
[3371.62 --> 3372.64]  That he would often say
[3372.64 --> 3374.28]  Especially
[3374.28 --> 3375.46]  During the trip
[3375.46 --> 3376.10]  There would be times
[3376.10 --> 3376.98]  When someone
[3376.98 --> 3377.86]  One person got COVID
[3377.86 --> 3378.76]  At the time
[3378.76 --> 3379.90]  One person also
[3379.90 --> 3382.30]  Had ate some
[3382.30 --> 3383.34]  Unwashed lettuce
[3383.34 --> 3383.82]  Or something
[3383.82 --> 3384.64]  And so you know
[3384.64 --> 3385.54]  Belly problems
[3385.54 --> 3387.32]  Was not able to go
[3387.32 --> 3388.30]  On this excursion
[3388.30 --> 3390.70]  And George's answer
[3390.70 --> 3392.26]  To this guy was
[3392.26 --> 3394.10]  That wasn't your portion
[3394.10 --> 3397.04]  And that is hard
[3397.04 --> 3398.00]  To hear
[3398.00 --> 3399.06]  Right
[3399.06 --> 3399.76]  You're all the way
[3399.76 --> 3400.42]  Across the world
[3400.42 --> 3400.82]  You're going to do
[3400.82 --> 3401.18]  This thing
[3401.18 --> 3401.74]  It's exciting
[3401.74 --> 3402.44]  You're sick
[3402.44 --> 3403.02]  You can't go
[3403.02 --> 3405.54]  That wasn't your portion
[3405.54 --> 3407.38]  It's not what the Lord gave
[3407.38 --> 3409.60]  And so
[3409.60 --> 3410.14]  You know
[3410.14 --> 3410.52]  And again
[3410.52 --> 3411.20]  That's really hard
[3411.20 --> 3412.02]  To accept sometimes
[3412.02 --> 3412.86]  That our portion
[3412.86 --> 3413.64]  Is not the same
[3413.64 --> 3414.62]  As someone else's
[3414.62 --> 3415.80]  Especially
[3415.80 --> 3417.32]  When it involves
[3417.32 --> 3418.42]  Suffering
[3418.42 --> 3421.06]  We don't want to hear that
[3421.06 --> 3424.00]  But when we compare
[3424.00 --> 3424.78]  Our lives
[3424.78 --> 3425.50]  To other people
[3425.50 --> 3426.72]  It's an accusation
[3426.72 --> 3427.42]  Against God
[3427.42 --> 3428.28]  Right
[3428.28 --> 3428.76]  Isn't it
[3428.76 --> 3429.56]  To say
[3429.56 --> 3429.92]  God
[3429.92 --> 3431.30]  Why didn't you give me
[3431.30 --> 3432.42]  What other people have
[3432.42 --> 3434.74]  You must not love me
[3434.74 --> 3435.48]  Right
[3435.48 --> 3436.98]  Or you must not be good
[3436.98 --> 3438.48]  And that produces
[3438.48 --> 3439.56]  Resentment
[3439.56 --> 3440.86]  In our hearts
[3440.86 --> 3441.88]  And it robs us
[3441.88 --> 3442.28]  Of joy
[3442.28 --> 3444.68]  So the very last thing
[3444.68 --> 3445.62]  That Jesus teaches
[3445.62 --> 3446.46]  His disciples
[3446.46 --> 3447.96]  And maybe it's a word
[3447.96 --> 3448.64]  That he's leaving
[3448.64 --> 3449.82]  For us as the church
[3449.82 --> 3451.54]  Is that we each
[3451.54 --> 3452.24]  Have a part
[3452.24 --> 3453.06]  To play
[3453.06 --> 3454.76]  In the story
[3454.76 --> 3455.66]  That God is writing
[3455.66 --> 3457.42]  We each have
[3457.42 --> 3458.14]  Our own portion
[3458.14 --> 3458.80]  Would be another way
[3458.80 --> 3459.20]  To say it
[3459.20 --> 3460.40]  But we each have
[3460.40 --> 3461.70]  Our own part
[3461.70 --> 3462.18]  To play
[3462.18 --> 3464.28]  So as an illustration
[3464.28 --> 3464.94]  To this
[3464.94 --> 3465.14]  You know
[3465.14 --> 3465.80]  One of the
[3465.80 --> 3467.66]  My favorite book series
[3467.66 --> 3468.48]  Is the Chronicles
[3468.48 --> 3468.92]  Of Narnia
[3468.92 --> 3470.44]  And one of the books
[3470.44 --> 3471.04]  In the series
[3471.04 --> 3471.48]  Is called
[3471.48 --> 3471.98]  The Horse
[3471.98 --> 3472.70]  And His Boy
[3472.70 --> 3474.28]  It's the story
[3474.28 --> 3475.28]  Of these two children
[3475.28 --> 3476.08]  Shasta
[3476.08 --> 3478.10]  And Aravis
[3478.10 --> 3479.72]  They're escaping
[3479.72 --> 3480.56]  From slavery
[3480.56 --> 3481.38]  And captivity
[3481.38 --> 3482.14]  In the country
[3482.14 --> 3482.84]  Of Kallerman
[3482.84 --> 3483.76]  And they're making
[3483.76 --> 3484.82]  Their way to Narnia
[3484.82 --> 3486.34]  The country of freedom
[3486.34 --> 3487.88]  And along the way
[3487.88 --> 3488.58]  They have all these
[3488.58 --> 3489.02]  Adventures
[3489.02 --> 3490.64]  And when Shasta
[3490.64 --> 3491.60]  Is about to enter
[3491.60 --> 3492.42]  Into Narnia
[3492.42 --> 3493.66]  He finally meets
[3493.66 --> 3494.12]  Aslan
[3494.12 --> 3494.50]  Right
[3494.50 --> 3495.18]  Who is the Christ
[3495.18 --> 3495.98]  Figure in
[3495.98 --> 3497.42]  The stories
[3497.42 --> 3498.64]  And they have
[3498.64 --> 3499.88]  This wonderful conversation
[3499.88 --> 3500.44]  And it's
[3500.44 --> 3501.16]  One of the most
[3501.16 --> 3502.00]  Moving passages
[3502.00 --> 3502.66]  In the book
[3502.66 --> 3503.76]  Where Aslan
[3503.76 --> 3504.74]  Is explaining
[3504.74 --> 3505.74]  Shasta's life
[3505.74 --> 3506.08]  To him
[3506.08 --> 3507.54]  And he's telling
[3507.54 --> 3508.06]  Shasta
[3508.06 --> 3509.56]  That he was there
[3509.56 --> 3510.32]  All along
[3510.32 --> 3512.32]  And the purpose
[3512.32 --> 3512.88]  He's telling him
[3512.88 --> 3513.38]  The purpose
[3513.38 --> 3514.56]  Of his being born
[3514.56 --> 3515.18]  Into slavery
[3515.18 --> 3516.80]  And all the hardships
[3516.80 --> 3518.12]  And all the obstacles
[3518.12 --> 3518.94]  That Shasta
[3518.94 --> 3519.74]  Had experienced
[3519.74 --> 3520.48]  Along the way
[3520.48 --> 3522.30]  And at one point
[3522.30 --> 3523.22]  Shasta
[3523.22 --> 3524.18]  Aslan
[3524.18 --> 3525.76]  Well what about
[3525.76 --> 3526.52]  Aravis
[3526.52 --> 3528.32]  His traveling companion
[3528.32 --> 3530.42]  And Aslan replies
[3530.42 --> 3531.30]  And listen to this
[3531.30 --> 3532.48]  Aslan says
[3532.48 --> 3533.52]  Child
[3533.52 --> 3536.38]  I am telling you
[3536.38 --> 3537.12]  Your story
[3537.12 --> 3538.38]  Not hers
[3538.38 --> 3540.40]  No one is told
[3540.40 --> 3541.40]  Any story
[3541.40 --> 3543.06]  But their own
[3543.06 --> 3545.92]  Right
[3545.92 --> 3546.60]  I am telling you
[3546.60 --> 3547.14]  Your story
[3547.14 --> 3547.78]  Not hers
[3547.78 --> 3549.28]  No one is told
[3549.28 --> 3549.94]  Any story
[3549.94 --> 3550.58]  But their own
[3550.58 --> 3551.50]  Right
[3551.50 --> 3552.08]  Isn't that great
[3552.08 --> 3554.18]  I think there's
[3554.18 --> 3555.06]  So much wisdom there
[3555.06 --> 3556.56]  And this is what
[3556.56 --> 3557.30]  Jesus is saying
[3557.30 --> 3558.00]  To us as well
[3558.00 --> 3559.26]  Right
[3559.26 --> 3560.36]  We only have access
[3560.36 --> 3561.30]  To our own stories
[3561.30 --> 3563.12]  We only know
[3563.12 --> 3564.24]  The journey of faith
[3564.24 --> 3566.00]  That we have been on
[3566.00 --> 3566.64]  And that God
[3566.64 --> 3568.10]  Has given to us
[3568.10 --> 3569.30]  We don't have
[3569.30 --> 3570.08]  The knowledge
[3570.08 --> 3571.30]  And we certainly
[3571.30 --> 3572.24]  Don't have the wisdom
[3572.24 --> 3573.18]  To compare
[3573.18 --> 3574.46]  Our life
[3574.46 --> 3576.08]  With someone else's life
[3576.08 --> 3577.80]  And so what is Jesus
[3577.80 --> 3578.44]  Saying to us
[3578.44 --> 3579.00]  He's saying
[3579.00 --> 3580.16]  Don't worry about
[3580.16 --> 3580.72]  Other people
[3580.72 --> 3582.06]  Right
[3582.06 --> 3583.10]  Instead he says
[3583.10 --> 3583.76]  Jesus says
[3583.76 --> 3584.46]  In verse 22
[3584.46 --> 3585.84]  Follow me
[3585.84 --> 3587.42]  Don't worry about
[3587.42 --> 3587.96]  Other people
[3587.96 --> 3590.20]  You follow me
[3590.20 --> 3593.10]  It's as if to say
[3593.10 --> 3595.64]  Keep your eyes on me
[3595.64 --> 3596.50]  And don't look
[3596.50 --> 3597.52]  At anyone else
[3597.52 --> 3599.00]  And you know
[3599.00 --> 3599.32]  Friends
[3599.32 --> 3600.50]  If we follow Jesus
[3600.50 --> 3601.16]  In this way
[3601.16 --> 3602.34]  With our eyes on him
[3602.34 --> 3603.82]  Not comparing ourselves
[3603.82 --> 3605.18]  With other fellow travelers
[3605.18 --> 3606.20]  In the Christian life
[3606.20 --> 3608.06]  This is wonderfully liberating
[3608.06 --> 3612.70]  Each of us has a unique story
[3612.70 --> 3614.24]  That God is writing
[3614.24 --> 3614.98]  In our lives
[3614.98 --> 3616.58]  And our job
[3616.58 --> 3617.94]  Is not to worry
[3617.94 --> 3619.16]  About other stories
[3619.16 --> 3620.62]  But is to do
[3620.62 --> 3621.62]  The best job
[3621.62 --> 3622.60]  That we can
[3622.60 --> 3623.82]  To follow Jesus
[3623.82 --> 3624.84]  With all of our heart
[3624.84 --> 3625.68]  With all of our soul
[3625.68 --> 3627.14]  With all of our strength
[3627.14 --> 3628.44]  Without comparison
[3628.44 --> 3630.96]  And to do so with joy
[3630.96 --> 3632.98]  And to do so with gratitude
[3632.98 --> 3636.14]  And so as we conclude
[3636.14 --> 3637.38]  You know
[3637.38 --> 3638.30]  We've seen that
[3638.30 --> 3640.82]  In this last conversation
[3640.82 --> 3643.10]  With Jesus and Peter
[3643.10 --> 3644.10]  Jesus has Peter
[3644.10 --> 3645.56]  You're not in control
[3645.56 --> 3647.76]  You're going to follow me
[3647.76 --> 3648.58]  I am in control
[3648.58 --> 3649.32]  Of what's going to happen
[3649.32 --> 3651.00]  I'm going to use your weakness
[3651.00 --> 3651.86]  I'm going to use your suffering
[3651.86 --> 3653.34]  And don't compare yourself
[3653.34 --> 3653.98]  With other people
[3653.98 --> 3655.20]  You follow me
[3655.20 --> 3655.94]  Right
[3655.94 --> 3657.30]  That's what Jesus says to Peter
[3657.30 --> 3659.44]  Something we all struggle with
[3659.44 --> 3660.72]  Is trying to
[3660.72 --> 3661.58]  We want to control
[3661.58 --> 3662.48]  Over our lives
[3662.48 --> 3663.06]  And what it means
[3663.06 --> 3663.82]  To follow Jesus
[3663.82 --> 3665.30]  Who Jesus is for us
[3665.30 --> 3666.32]  We want to compare ourselves
[3666.32 --> 3666.90]  With other people
[3666.90 --> 3668.24]  Now
[3668.24 --> 3670.38]  And Jesus just calls us again
[3670.38 --> 3671.14]  Just follow me
[3671.14 --> 3671.96]  Follow me
[3671.96 --> 3674.54]  And so let's consider
[3674.54 --> 3675.46]  In this passage
[3675.46 --> 3677.10]  The grace of God
[3677.10 --> 3678.22]  Where is the gospel
[3678.22 --> 3679.04]  In this passage
[3679.04 --> 3680.56]  In this final conversation
[3680.56 --> 3681.72]  So
[3681.72 --> 3682.84]  I want you to imagine
[3682.84 --> 3683.94]  The scene again with me
[3683.94 --> 3686.62]  Peter is walking
[3686.62 --> 3687.84]  And talking to Jesus
[3687.84 --> 3690.28]  He's been told
[3690.28 --> 3691.22]  How he's going to die
[3691.22 --> 3692.76]  And then
[3692.76 --> 3694.20]  He asks about John
[3694.20 --> 3695.98]  Now just for a minute
[3695.98 --> 3697.70]  Imagine God the Father
[3697.70 --> 3698.70]  Walking
[3698.70 --> 3699.66]  And talking
[3699.66 --> 3701.34]  With Jesus the Son
[3701.34 --> 3703.80]  And just as Jesus
[3703.80 --> 3704.82]  Had said to Peter
[3704.82 --> 3706.06]  You will stretch out
[3706.06 --> 3706.80]  Your hands
[3706.80 --> 3709.38]  The Father said to the Son
[3709.38 --> 3710.98]  You will stretch out
[3710.98 --> 3711.56]  Your hands
[3711.56 --> 3713.86]  And you will be crucified
[3713.86 --> 3716.34]  And the Father said
[3716.34 --> 3716.82]  To the Son
[3716.82 --> 3718.10]  Someone else will lead you
[3718.10 --> 3719.12]  Where you don't want to go
[3719.12 --> 3721.84]  Right in the Garden of Gethsemane
[3721.84 --> 3723.08]  It was the Lord Jesus
[3723.08 --> 3723.68]  Who said
[3723.68 --> 3724.78]  Lord Father
[3724.78 --> 3726.28]  Remove this cup from me
[3726.28 --> 3727.92]  Right he did not want to go
[3727.92 --> 3728.76]  To that place
[3728.76 --> 3730.22]  Where he would be abandoned
[3730.22 --> 3731.00]  And forsaken
[3731.00 --> 3732.32]  By his Father
[3732.32 --> 3734.32]  And yet
[3734.32 --> 3736.24]  That was the plan
[3736.24 --> 3737.76]  For Jesus' life
[3737.76 --> 3739.90]  That was the death
[3739.90 --> 3740.96]  By which Jesus
[3740.96 --> 3742.20]  Would glorify God
[3742.20 --> 3745.38]  And now imagine
[3745.38 --> 3747.36]  Jesus walking on that road
[3747.36 --> 3748.22]  With his Father
[3748.22 --> 3749.94]  Looking back
[3749.94 --> 3751.44]  At you and me
[3751.44 --> 3753.22]  And asking
[3753.22 --> 3754.08]  What about them
[3754.08 --> 3755.88]  Right what
[3755.88 --> 3756.70]  What about me
[3756.70 --> 3757.18]  And you
[3757.18 --> 3758.02]  Sitting here
[3758.02 --> 3759.44]  What is going to happen
[3759.44 --> 3760.38]  To them
[3760.38 --> 3762.76]  Well they're not going
[3762.76 --> 3763.56]  To die on the cross
[3763.56 --> 3765.62]  Right they're not going
[3765.62 --> 3766.68]  To go where they deserve
[3766.68 --> 3767.06]  To go
[3767.06 --> 3768.34]  Because of their sin
[3768.34 --> 3769.20]  In fact
[3769.20 --> 3770.16]  They are going to receive
[3770.16 --> 3771.36]  What they do not deserve
[3771.36 --> 3772.72]  They are going to receive
[3772.72 --> 3773.32]  Grace
[3773.32 --> 3774.46]  And mercy
[3774.46 --> 3776.00]  And eternal life
[3776.00 --> 3777.52]  And they're going to receive it
[3777.52 --> 3779.24]  They're going to receive
[3779.24 --> 3779.90]  Everything
[3779.90 --> 3781.16]  Freely given
[3781.16 --> 3784.60]  And friends
[3784.60 --> 3785.24]  You and I
[3785.24 --> 3786.06]  Are sitting here
[3786.06 --> 3787.02]  Because Jesus
[3787.02 --> 3788.78]  Let go of control
[3788.78 --> 3789.98]  Of his own life
[3789.98 --> 3790.70]  And he said
[3790.70 --> 3791.16]  Father
[3791.16 --> 3792.32]  Not my will
[3792.32 --> 3793.50]  But what your will
[3793.50 --> 3794.50]  Be done
[3794.50 --> 3796.20]  And because Jesus
[3796.20 --> 3797.12]  Obeyed his Father
[3797.12 --> 3798.52]  He went to the cross
[3798.52 --> 3799.26]  He went to the grave
[3799.26 --> 3800.10]  For our sakes
[3800.10 --> 3801.50]  So that we don't have to
[3801.50 --> 3804.44]  That was the singular
[3804.44 --> 3805.98]  Unique story
[3805.98 --> 3807.34]  For Jesus' life
[3807.34 --> 3809.62]  So that God
[3809.62 --> 3810.46]  Could then write
[3810.46 --> 3811.36]  A different story
[3811.36 --> 3813.64]  A gracious story
[3813.64 --> 3815.40]  For our lives
[3815.40 --> 3816.78]  And so that he
[3816.78 --> 3818.00]  Could call us
[3818.00 --> 3819.38]  To follow him
[3819.38 --> 3820.78]  And be restored
[3820.78 --> 3821.68]  In this relationship
[3821.68 --> 3822.26]  With him
[3822.26 --> 3824.94]  So that's the gospel
[3824.94 --> 3825.48]  For us
[3825.48 --> 3826.74]  Let's pray
[3826.74 --> 3831.32]  Our Father in heaven
[3831.32 --> 3832.04]  We thank you
[3832.04 --> 3832.84]  For your mercy
[3832.84 --> 3833.88]  To us through Christ
[3833.88 --> 3836.02]  How you could give us
[3836.02 --> 3837.08]  So much worse
[3837.08 --> 3838.22]  Than what we receive
[3838.22 --> 3841.30]  And yet instead
[3841.30 --> 3842.40]  You gave us your love
[3842.40 --> 3844.18]  And you gave us grace
[3844.18 --> 3846.68]  And yet still sometimes
[3846.68 --> 3847.84]  In our unbelief
[3847.84 --> 3848.42]  Our struggles
[3848.42 --> 3849.56]  We wonder why us
[3849.56 --> 3851.34]  Why do we go through this
[3851.34 --> 3852.62]  Why do we go through that
[3852.62 --> 3853.78]  Why not others
[3853.78 --> 3856.14]  And yet we fail to remember
[3856.14 --> 3856.88]  That our Savior
[3856.88 --> 3858.12]  Went through far worse
[3858.12 --> 3859.76]  So that we could go
[3859.76 --> 3860.76]  Through far better
[3860.76 --> 3862.46]  And so Lord
[3862.46 --> 3863.30]  Would you lead us
[3863.30 --> 3863.88]  And help us
[3863.88 --> 3864.58]  To follow you
[3864.58 --> 3866.88]  Wholeheartedly
[3866.88 --> 3869.50]  Without holding on
[3869.50 --> 3870.04]  To control
[3870.04 --> 3871.06]  And without comparing
[3871.06 --> 3872.36]  But with joy
[3872.36 --> 3873.14]  And gratitude
[3873.14 --> 3875.52]  With all of our hearts
[3875.52 --> 3876.20]  We pray this
[3876.20 --> 3877.06]  For Jesus' sake
[3877.06 --> 3877.76]  Amen
[3877.76 --> 3881.86]  Let's stand
[3881.86 --> 3882.62]  And sing together
[3882.62 --> 3884.96]  A song that reflects
[3884.96 --> 3885.60]  On the image
[3885.60 --> 3886.16]  Of the potter
[3886.16 --> 3886.72]  And the clay
[3886.72 --> 3887.90]  The clay submitted
[3887.90 --> 3889.00]  To the hands
[3889.00 --> 3889.64]  Of the potter
[3889.64 --> 3891.78]  And being yielded
[3891.78 --> 3892.30]  And still
[3892.30 --> 3893.50]  Let's stand
[3893.50 --> 3897.28]  And still
[3897.28 --> 3898.16]  Let's stand
[3898.16 --> 3903.26]  Have thine own way
[3903.26 --> 3903.54]  Lord
[3903.54 --> 3907.54]  Have thine own way
[3907.54 --> 3917.54]  Lord
[3917.54 --> 3920.66]  Have thine own way
[3920.66 --> 3926.54]  Thou art the water
[3926.54 --> 3931.48]  I am the clay
[3931.48 --> 3936.86]  Hold me and make me
[3936.86 --> 3937.14]  Hold me and make me
[3937.14 --> 3939.74]  After thy will
[3939.74 --> 3945.12]  While I am waiting
[3945.12 --> 3946.40]  While I am waiting
[3946.40 --> 3946.42]  While I am waiting
[3946.42 --> 3950.80]  Yielding and steady
[3950.80 --> 3953.20]  Have thine own way
[3953.20 --> 3957.06]  Have thine own way
[3957.06 --> 3962.32]  Have thine own way
[3962.32 --> 3969.32]  Search me and drive me
[3969.32 --> 3972.70]  Pastor today
[3972.70 --> 3977.70]  My care then shows
[3977.70 --> 3983.80]  What he does now
[3983.80 --> 3988.70]  As in thy presence
[3988.70 --> 4014.20]  S
[4014.20 --> 4033.64]  Power of power, surely is nigh. Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.
[4033.64 --> 4045.08]  Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[4045.08 --> 4054.82]  Hold her by me, act of strength.
[4054.82 --> 4064.82]  Fill with thy spirit, till all shall see.
[4066.82 --> 4075.26]  Christ only always, in me.
[4075.26 --> 4083.26]  I surrender all.
[4085.02 --> 4089.26]  I surrender all.
[4089.26 --> 4104.26]  All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[4108.26 --> 4108.90]  Amen.
[4109.16 --> 4109.80]  You may be seated.
[4119.26 --> 4126.90]  So part of our response to the gospel message this morning is the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4127.90 --> 4132.36]  And it's a time, as you know, to give back to God a portion of what he has given to us.
[4132.36 --> 4137.82]  If you are a visitor today, don't feel any obligated to give and do give to your own church.
[4138.06 --> 4148.20]  If you are a member, a regular attender to us, then part of our membership and being a part of a body is to give to support the work of our ministry together.
[4148.20 --> 4154.02]  So could I ask the deacons to come forward to collect the offering?
[4154.20 --> 4157.74]  And our designated offering for today is for new ground.
[4157.84 --> 4159.66]  And I think there was an insert in your bulletin.
[4160.00 --> 4161.64]  You can read a little bit more about that.
[4161.64 --> 4175.40]  Thank you.
[4175.40 --> 4205.38]  Thank you.
[4205.40 --> 4235.38]  Thank you.
[4235.40 --> 4265.38]  Thank you.
[4265.40 --> 4295.38]  Thank you.
[4295.40 --> 4325.38]  Thank you.
[4325.40 --> 4355.38]  Thank you.
[4355.40 --> 4385.38]  Thank you.
[4385.38 --> 4392.80]  Let's now pray together and we pray, you know, not only prayers of praise to God and confession
[4392.80 --> 4400.60]  of our sins, but we also bring our supplications to the Lord and ask for him to be at work in
[4400.60 --> 4404.68]  all the things that in our lives and in the world in ways that we need him to.
[4404.68 --> 4409.68]  And I'm going to begin by reading a passage, 1 Chronicles 29.
[4409.68 --> 4415.68]  And then we will conclude by saying the Lord's prayer together.
[4415.68 --> 4445.66]  So let's pray.
[4445.66 --> 4448.60]  Heavenly Father, we give you thanks for your heavenly Father, we give you thanks for your
[4448.60 --> 4452.54]  heavenly Father, we give you thanks for your infinite goodness and your abundant mercy that
[4452.54 --> 4454.16]  you shower upon us.
[4454.66 --> 4461.84]  Your mercies truly are new every morning and your covenant faithfulness is from everlasting
[4461.84 --> 4462.60]  to everlasting.
[4462.60 --> 4469.86]  We thank you for sending your son, Jesus, as the Lamb of God to take away our sin.
[4469.86 --> 4476.72]  We thank you for the gift of your spirit who leads us to hold fast to our confession of the gospel.
[4476.72 --> 4481.22]  We thank you for your church for bringing us here together.
[4482.34 --> 4484.96]  And may the word of Christ dwell in us richly.
[4485.46 --> 4493.38]  And may it make us complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work as we seek to glorify God in our lives.
[4493.38 --> 4506.32]  And through your spirit, may we put on mercy, kindness and humility and patience and forgiveness towards one another, bound together in love.
[4506.32 --> 4511.32]  Lord, we pray for the world.
[4511.32 --> 4518.56]  We pray, Lord, for all the conflicts that continue to rage around the world and that claim so many lives.
[4519.32 --> 4524.96]  We ask that these conflicts would end, that your kingdom of peace would come.
[4524.96 --> 4528.76]  We acknowledge, Lord, that you rule over all the nations.
[4529.02 --> 4529.94]  You raise them up.
[4530.94 --> 4533.68]  You bring them down according to your purposes.
[4534.84 --> 4541.34]  We pray, Lord, for those who are fleeing from persecution and violence because of their faith in you.
[4542.52 --> 4549.34]  Lord, we think especially of Iran and other countries, Lord, where it is not safe to confess your name.
[4550.14 --> 4554.18]  And Lord, we pray for a measure of protection over them.
[4554.96 --> 4560.96]  So that they might, more people would also come to know you and that they could continue to live to glorify your name.
[4561.78 --> 4568.92]  We pray that you would guide our leaders here in Canada, whether elected or appointed, whether federally or provincially.
[4568.92 --> 4576.54]  Give them, Lord, wisdom and insight to make right decisions so that we, your people, may live quiet and godly lives.
[4577.70 --> 4583.86]  We pray for those in our congregation, Lord, who are facing struggles and sufferings of various kinds.
[4583.86 --> 4586.56]  We pray for those in our congregation who mourn and who grieve.
[4587.14 --> 4593.90]  We pray this morning especially for Brandon, who misses his grandfather, who has passed away.
[4594.04 --> 4599.86]  Lord, would you be with Brandon and comfort him and also work in his life and in his heart to know you and love you more.
[4599.86 --> 4604.46]  Please also strengthen and encourage families in our midst.
[4605.02 --> 4613.18]  We pray that you would continue to bless our children's Sunday school ministry, all the children who come every week to learn about you.
[4613.26 --> 4615.48]  Also on Thursdays, the cadets and the gems.
[4617.44 --> 4622.14]  And Lord, we pray for your church around the world as well as for your church here in Delta.
[4622.14 --> 4631.08]  And Lord, may the light of Christ shine forth in us and through us, your people, as we seek to follow you and live for you in the world.
[4631.98 --> 4637.28]  And we ask all of this in the name of Jesus, who taught us to pray, saying together,
[4637.28 --> 4665.28]  Amen.
[4665.28 --> 4665.36]  Amen.
[4667.12 --> 4671.74]  Please stand and we will have the benediction and sing our final song.
[4671.86 --> 4678.28]  And just a reminder, for those of you who are members, after we sing our song, just have a seat.
[4678.84 --> 4682.14]  And we will have our affirmation voting.
[4682.90 --> 4686.02]  And if you are not a member, you may feel free to go on out.
[4687.82 --> 4691.16]  So I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4691.16 --> 4699.22]  To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4699.62 --> 4705.62]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[4705.86 --> 4709.00]  before all ages and now and forevermore.
[4709.38 --> 4709.78]  Amen.
[4709.78 --> 4724.52]  By your grace, we've been saved, born again too long.
[4725.24 --> 4731.38]  Joined by faith, one in heart, for your glory, Lord.
[4731.38 --> 4732.28]  God bless you, Lord.
[4732.28 --> 4735.42]  Grant us peace and unity.
[4736.28 --> 4738.70]  Fill us now, we pray.
[4740.00 --> 4743.20]  Hand in hand, with souls set free.
[4743.94 --> 4746.76]  Find us, Lord, and use us, Lord.
[4747.00 --> 4749.88]  Oh, lead us, Lord, today.
[4749.88 --> 4750.76]  But may, who know this song, we kes fellow, please, we pray.
[4750.76 --> 4759.76]  If, in God, we could live, by His hue, please, we would save you.
[4760.00 --> 4761.56]  Amen.
[4763.74 --> 4765.28]  Amen.
[4765.28 --> 4766.64]  We pray.
[4767.22 --> 4767.30]  We pray.
[4771.80 --> 4773.96]  For may, we say, we're easy, we pray.
[4774.04 --> 4778.50]  And ban with souls set free.
[4778.50 --> 4782.14]  Find us Lord and use us Lord,
[4782.44 --> 4785.94]  all of us Lord together.
