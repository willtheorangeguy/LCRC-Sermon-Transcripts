[0.00 --> 3.84]  here in a psalm every day, then this is a reading plan that you can follow.
[8.16 --> 14.48]  In addition, we have sign-ups for small groups. If you are not in a small group and you'd like
[14.48 --> 23.16]  to join one, there's a sign-up sheet on the foyer table. And Joe Vuktevin's celebration of life,
[23.24 --> 29.12]  his memorial service, will be this Saturday at one o'clock here in the sanctuary, and there will
[29.12 --> 35.32]  not be live streamed, so if you wanted to watch that, you should come in person. Next Sunday as
[35.32 --> 41.98]  well, there is Mountain View singing at the Mountain View Care home at 2 p.m. next Sunday afternoon.
[42.60 --> 50.26]  And we are also looking for some volunteers as we head into the fall for Sunday school. So if you
[50.26 --> 55.84]  are interested to serve, you know, I think maybe you would just teach once a month or so,
[55.84 --> 59.16]  then please do talk to me about teaching Sunday school.
[60.94 --> 66.62]  Now with that, you know, we are here because God has brought us into a relationship with himself,
[67.22 --> 74.54]  and it is our great joy to worship him and to receive his blessing. So let's be called to worship
[74.54 --> 80.66]  from his word today, from Psalm 84. And we'll read it responsibly, and I'll begin.
[80.66 --> 93.22]  How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord.
[93.78 --> 101.50]  My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house.
[102.04 --> 109.68]  They are ever praising you. Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
[109.68 --> 119.88]  Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
[119.88 --> 128.46]  than dwell in the tents of the wicked. Would you please join me in a prayer of praise and adoration to our God?
[128.54 --> 131.74]  Let's lift up our hearts to God in prayer.
[131.74 --> 144.12]  Father, O God, you are great and greatly to be praised. We thank you, Lord, for all that you do for us day in and day out.
[144.90 --> 150.64]  Father, as we are here worshiping you, we realize that we don't even do that on our own very well.
[151.66 --> 155.16]  And so we, Lord, we ask for your help this morning. Would you be among us now?
[155.16 --> 164.34]  By your spirit, would you infuse everything that we hear, everything that we say and sing, everything that we pray and do.
[164.64 --> 170.10]  Lord, would they be expressions of love to you and praise to you?
[171.14 --> 177.66]  Lord, we ask that you would be with us in all of your might, in all of your glory.
[177.66 --> 185.26]  And Lord, help us to turn our hearts to you and Lord, to receive your blessing this morning.
[185.36 --> 188.40]  We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[191.14 --> 198.04]  Let's all stand. As the Lord has called us to worship, he now greets us and we will receive God's blessing.
[198.62 --> 204.16]  Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.
[204.16 --> 207.08]  The Lord loves us, his children, this morning.
[207.58 --> 210.90]  And so let's turn and let's greet one another as God has greeted us.
[210.90 --> 211.02]  Amen.
[234.16 --> 234.76]  Amen.
[234.90 --> 237.70]  Amen.
[240.50 --> 240.98]  Amen.
[241.04 --> 241.16]  Amen.
[243.50 --> 243.86]  Amen.
[247.86 --> 248.44]  Amen.
[249.84 --> 251.22]  Amen.
[251.74 --> 256.94]  Amen.
[258.10 --> 258.16]  Amen.
[258.98 --> 259.14]  Amen.
[261.82 --> 262.12]  Amen.
[262.12 --> 262.48]  Amen.
[262.52 --> 262.86]  Amen.
[262.86 --> 263.72]  Amen.
[263.72 --> 264.06]  Amen.
[264.06 --> 264.10]  Amen.
[264.10 --> 264.14]  Amen.
[264.16 --> 281.54]  Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
[282.46 --> 291.78]  Lord, I so praise Him for His, your help and salvation.
[291.78 --> 301.92]  Love all who hear, brothers and sisters from here.
[302.42 --> 307.94]  Join me in the adoration.
[310.94 --> 321.04]  Praise to the Lord for all things His wondrous in bringing.
[321.78 --> 331.94]  Sheltering under His wings, oh so gently sustaining.
[333.98 --> 342.78]  And you must see all that is with you has been.
[342.78 --> 350.78]  Sent by His gracious ordained name.
[353.28 --> 362.78]  Praise to the Lord who will prosper your work and defend you.
[362.78 --> 374.78]  Surely His goodness and mercy shall daily attend you.
[374.78 --> 384.94]  Honor anew, what He Almighty can do.
[384.94 --> 391.98]  As with His love He befriends you.
[391.98 --> 416.42]  Praise to the Lord for all that is in me.
[416.42 --> 420.08]  Let me adore Him.
[420.42 --> 423.82]  All that has died,
[424.16 --> 430.42]  And come now with praises before Him.
[430.42 --> 436.42]  Let me adore Him.
[436.42 --> 440.42]  Let me adore Him.
[440.42 --> 448.42]  Let me forever adore Him.
[448.42 --> 454.42]  Let me adore Him.
[454.42 --> 458.42]  All that has died,
[458.42 --> 460.42]  Let me adore Him.
[460.42 --> 485.68]  O God, read me on the praise of you,
[485.68 --> 489.68]  We worship you today,
[490.26 --> 498.18]  And sing the love amazing that songs cannot remain.
[500.02 --> 509.12]  For we can only wonder at every gift to send,
[509.12 --> 513.90]  And blessings without wonder,
[514.24 --> 518.48]  And mercies without end,
[518.84 --> 523.36]  We lift our hearts before you,
[523.58 --> 527.12]  And we hold your word,
[528.12 --> 532.12]  We honor and adore you,
[532.12 --> 537.80]  Our great and mighty Lord.
[539.12 --> 544.32]  The flower of earth is tender,
[544.96 --> 549.12]  In time must surely die,
[549.60 --> 553.94]  Its fragile wounds surrender,
[554.54 --> 559.12]  To live the Lord was high,
[559.12 --> 564.32]  Blood hidden from all mixture,
[564.32 --> 569.12]  Eternal sin is so,
[569.12 --> 573.12]  O small Lord of stature,
[573.12 --> 578.12]  To heaven's garden road,
[578.12 --> 583.32]  For Christ your gift from heaven,
[583.32 --> 587.12]  From death has set us free,
[587.12 --> 592.12]  And we to him are given,
[592.12 --> 597.12]  The final victory.
[597.12 --> 616.42]  Then hear, O gracious Savior,
[616.42 --> 620.12]  Accept the love we pray,
[620.12 --> 625.12]  That we who know your favor,
[625.12 --> 630.12]  May serve you as our king,
[630.12 --> 640.12]  And whether our tomorrow's be filled with good or ill,
[640.12 --> 645.12]  We'll triumph through our sorrows,
[645.12 --> 649.12]  And rise to bless you still,
[649.12 --> 654.12]  To marvel at your beauty,
[654.12 --> 659.12]  And glory in your ways,
[659.12 --> 664.12]  And be the joyful duty,
[664.12 --> 669.12]  Our sacrifice of praise,
[669.12 --> 682.12]  I want to share just a little thing.
[682.12 --> 684.12]  A couple weeks ago,
[684.12 --> 687.12]  My family and I were at this garlic festival in Richmond.
[687.12 --> 689.12]  Has anybody been to the garlic festival?
[689.12 --> 691.12]  That was our first time,
[691.12 --> 692.12]  Yeah? Oh, a couple.
[692.12 --> 693.12]  I bought some garlic,
[693.12 --> 695.12]  It's so nice to use,
[695.12 --> 696.12]  It's very good.
[696.12 --> 697.12]  My point is,
[697.12 --> 699.12]  You know, they had a little band,
[699.12 --> 701.12]  And they were trying to get the audience to sing,
[701.12 --> 702.12]  And they said something,
[702.12 --> 703.12]  The leader said something,
[703.12 --> 704.12]  She was like,
[704.12 --> 705.12]  You know, don't worry about how you sound,
[705.12 --> 707.12]  If you're singing off key,
[707.12 --> 708.12]  You're just harmonizing.
[708.12 --> 710.12]  And I thought I would share that with you all,
[710.12 --> 711.12]  Because, you know,
[711.12 --> 712.12]  I need that reminder too.
[712.12 --> 713.12]  And you know,
[713.12 --> 714.12]  I think some of our singers were harmonizing,
[714.12 --> 715.12]  So I thought of it.
[717.12 --> 718.12]  Anyway,
[718.12 --> 722.12]  Let's open our Bibles to Luke,
[722.12 --> 724.12]  The Gospel of Luke.
[724.12 --> 727.12]  And we will read today Luke 19,
[727.12 --> 729.12]  Luke chapter 19.
[735.12 --> 739.12]  And that is on page 782 in your pew Bible.
[739.12 --> 740.12]  Page 782.
[740.12 --> 741.12]  The words will also be on the screen.
[744.12 --> 747.12]  Okay, so we'll read Luke 19,
[747.12 --> 751.12]  verses 28 to 44.
[753.12 --> 754.12]  After Jesus had said this,
[754.12 --> 756.12]  He went on ahead,
[756.12 --> 758.12]  Going up to Jerusalem.
[759.12 --> 762.12]  As He approached Bethphage and Bethany
[762.12 --> 764.12]  At the hill called the Mount of Olives,
[764.12 --> 766.12]  He sent two of His disciples,
[766.12 --> 768.12]  Saying to them,
[768.12 --> 770.12]  Go to the village ahead of you,
[770.12 --> 771.12]  And as you enter it,
[771.12 --> 773.12]  You will find a colt tied there,
[773.12 --> 775.12]  Which no one has ever ridden.
[775.12 --> 777.12]  Untie it and bring it here.
[777.12 --> 779.12]  If anyone asks you,
[779.12 --> 781.12]  Why are you untying it?
[781.12 --> 782.12]  Tell him,
[782.12 --> 783.12]  The Lord needs it.
[784.12 --> 786.12]  Those who were sent ahead went and found it,
[786.12 --> 788.12]  Just as He had told them.
[788.12 --> 790.12]  As they were untying the colt,
[790.12 --> 791.12]  Its owners asked them,
[791.12 --> 793.12]  Why are you untying the colt?
[793.12 --> 794.12]  They replied,
[794.12 --> 796.12]  The Lord needs it.
[796.12 --> 798.12]  They brought it to Jesus,
[798.12 --> 800.12]  Threw their cloaks on the colt,
[800.12 --> 802.12]  And put Jesus on it.
[802.12 --> 803.12]  As He went along,
[803.12 --> 805.12]  People spread their cloaks on the road.
[805.12 --> 808.12]  When He came near the place,
[808.12 --> 811.12]  Where the road goes down to the Mount of Olives,
[811.12 --> 814.12]  The whole crowd of disciples began joyfully
[814.12 --> 817.12]  To praise God in loud voices
[817.12 --> 820.12]  For all the miracles they had seen.
[820.12 --> 824.12]  Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord,
[824.12 --> 827.12]  Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.
[827.12 --> 831.12]  Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus,
[831.12 --> 833.12]  Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
[833.12 --> 835.12]  I tell you, He replied,
[835.12 --> 839.12]  If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.
[839.12 --> 844.12]  As He approached Jerusalem and saw the city,
[844.12 --> 847.12]  He wept over it and said,
[847.12 --> 851.12]  If you, even you, had only known on this day
[851.12 --> 853.12]  What would bring you peace,
[853.12 --> 856.12]  But now it is hidden from your eyes.
[856.12 --> 858.12]  The days will come upon you
[858.12 --> 861.12]  When your enemies will build an embarkment against you
[861.12 --> 864.12]  And encircle you and hem you in on every side.
[864.12 --> 866.12]  They will dash you to the ground,
[866.12 --> 868.12]  You and the children within your walls.
[868.12 --> 871.12]  They will not leave one stone on another
[871.12 --> 875.12]  Because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.
[875.12 --> 877.12]  This is the word of the Lord.
[877.12 --> 884.12]  So we come now to a time of confession.
[884.12 --> 888.12]  And as we come and confess our sins,
[888.12 --> 891.12]  We do so as individuals.
[891.12 --> 897.12]  Because you have sinned different sins than I have this week.
[897.12 --> 901.12]  And I have sinned different sins than you have this week.
[901.12 --> 908.12]  But at the same time, we are all of us guilty before a perfectly holy and righteous God.
[908.12 --> 915.12]  And so, because we are all sinners, we are all equally in need of God's grace and forgiveness in our lives.
[915.12 --> 921.12]  Let us together come to Him in this corporate prayer of confession.
[921.12 --> 928.12]  So please bow your heads and pray with me as I lead us in this prayer.
[928.12 --> 934.12]  All knowing God and Father, you have searched us and you know us.
[934.12 --> 940.12]  You see every deed, hear every word, and discern every thought.
[941.12 --> 945.12]  You know our hidden faults and you see our secret sins.
[945.12 --> 955.12]  Our pride, our lust, our envy, our bitterness, our ingratitude, and our unbelief.
[955.12 --> 963.12]  In your great mercy, O Lord, cover our transgressions in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[963.12 --> 967.12]  Forgive the sin within us and renew us by your spirit,
[967.12 --> 971.12]  that we might walk in the ways of everlasting life,
[971.12 --> 975.12]  being fully alive in you the way you have created us to be.
[976.12 --> 978.12]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[980.12 --> 984.12]  And let's receive now God's assurance of our forgiveness,
[984.12 --> 988.12]  because it is certain and we receive it.
[990.12 --> 992.12]  John 3 16, let's say it together.
[992.12 --> 996.12]  For God so loved the world that he gave us the world of God.
[996.12 --> 999.12]  That he gave his one and only son,
[999.12 --> 1005.12]  that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[1006.12 --> 1007.12]  Thanks be to God.
[1008.12 --> 1013.12]  Let's all stand and we'll sing two more songs while we're standing of
[1014.12 --> 1015.12]  in response to God's grace to us.
[1015.12 --> 1016.12]  God's grace to us.
[1016.12 --> 1017.12]  Thank you, John.
[1017.12 --> 1021.12]  God's grace to us.
[1021.12 --> 1051.10]  Thank you.
[1051.12 --> 1081.10]  Thank you.
[1081.12 --> 1083.12]  Thank you.
[1111.12 --> 1122.50]  Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer.
[1122.50 --> 1132.50]  He makes our sorrow in spirit sing.
[1132.50 --> 1155.86]  Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations, Son of God and Son of Man.
[1155.86 --> 1177.54]  Glory and honor, praise and oration, now and forevermore be Thine.
[1177.54 --> 1179.54]  Amen.
[1179.54 --> 1181.54]  Amen.
[1181.54 --> 1183.54]  Amen.
[1183.54 --> 1185.54]  Amen.
[1185.54 --> 1187.54]  Amen.
[1187.54 --> 1189.54]  Amen.
[1189.54 --> 1191.54]  Amen.
[1191.54 --> 1193.54]  Amen.
[1193.54 --> 1195.54]  Amen.
[1195.54 --> 1197.54]  Amen.
[1197.54 --> 1199.54]  Amen.
[1199.54 --> 1201.54]  Amen.
[1201.54 --> 1203.54]  Amen.
[1203.54 --> 1205.54]  Amen.
[1205.54 --> 1207.54]  Amen.
[1207.54 --> 1209.54]  Amen.
[1209.54 --> 1211.54]  Amen.
[1211.54 --> 1213.54]  Amen.
[1213.54 --> 1215.54]  Amen.
[1215.54 --> 1217.54]  Amen.
[1217.54 --> 1219.54]  Amen.
[1219.54 --> 1220.54]  Amen.
[1220.54 --> 1221.54]  Amen.
[1221.54 --> 1223.54]  Amen.
[1223.54 --> 1225.54]  Amen.
[1225.54 --> 1235.40]  Sing praise, sing praise
[1235.40 --> 1240.78]  With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm
[1240.78 --> 1244.12]  His love endures forever
[1244.12 --> 1250.28]  For the life that's been reborn
[1250.28 --> 1253.82]  His love endures forever
[1253.82 --> 1261.98]  Sing praise, sing praise
[1261.98 --> 1270.42]  Sing praise, sing praise
[1270.42 --> 1276.40]  Forever God is faithful
[1276.40 --> 1280.82]  Forever God is strong
[1280.82 --> 1285.74]  Forever God is with us
[1285.74 --> 1286.98]  Forever
[1286.98 --> 1291.90]  Forever
[1291.90 --> 1299.82]  From the rising to the setting sun
[1299.82 --> 1303.18]  His love endures forever
[1303.18 --> 1309.44]  And by the grace of God we will carry on
[1309.44 --> 1312.76]  His love endures forever
[1312.76 --> 1319.60]  Sing praise, sing praise
[1319.60 --> 1326.60]  Sing praise, sing praise
[1326.60 --> 1328.60]  Sing praise
[1328.60 --> 1334.76]  Forever God is faithful
[1334.76 --> 1338.88]  Forever God is strong
[1338.88 --> 1343.84]  Forever God is with us
[1343.84 --> 1345.14]  Forever
[1345.14 --> 1347.76]  Forever
[1347.76 --> 1349.76]  Forever
[1349.76 --> 1352.92]  Forever
[1352.92 --> 1353.92]  Forever
[1353.92 --> 1355.92]  God is faithful
[1355.92 --> 1357.92]  Forever
[1357.92 --> 1359.98]  God is strong
[1359.98 --> 1361.92]  Forever
[1361.92 --> 1365.06]  God is with us
[1365.06 --> 1366.38]  Forever
[1366.38 --> 1369.92]  Forever
[1369.92 --> 1390.34]  Forever
[1390.34 --> 1394.14]  Yes, it is, I was wondering.
[1394.92 --> 1397.34]  It's time for the kids to go to their classes.
[1398.06 --> 1399.70]  Thanks for joining us up till now.
[1399.70 --> 1401.18]  Thank you.
[1408.18 --> 1416.78]  All right, so we have been in the Psalms over the summer,
[1416.78 --> 1421.44]  and today we will look at one final psalm
[1421.44 --> 1423.88]  because summer is almost over.
[1424.66 --> 1427.40]  You know, we're heading into the fall, excuse me,
[1427.40 --> 1431.42]  and as we turn to the fall, we will next week begin a new series
[1431.42 --> 1432.76]  in the book of Romans.
[1433.24 --> 1437.56]  So I'm looking forward to that, but today we will be in Psalm 137.
[1437.92 --> 1442.46]  So please open your Bibles and keep them open as we go.
[1442.46 --> 1448.40]  And turn to Psalm 137.
[1448.88 --> 1452.12]  That is on page 466 in your pew Bible.
[1452.12 --> 1467.00]  Okay, so Psalm 137.
[1467.54 --> 1472.56]  By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept
[1472.56 --> 1474.76]  when we remembered Zion.
[1475.84 --> 1478.36]  There on the poplars we hung our harps,
[1478.36 --> 1481.94]  for there our captors asked us for songs.
[1482.72 --> 1485.02]  Our tormentors demanded songs of joy.
[1485.36 --> 1487.46]  They said, sing us one of the songs of Zion.
[1488.64 --> 1490.74]  How can we sing the songs of the Lord
[1490.74 --> 1492.46]  while in a foreign land?
[1493.12 --> 1494.88]  If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
[1495.48 --> 1497.60]  may my right hand forget its skill.
[1498.16 --> 1500.46]  May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
[1500.46 --> 1502.04]  if I do not remember you,
[1502.50 --> 1505.14]  if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.
[1505.14 --> 1508.26]  Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did
[1508.26 --> 1509.66]  on the day Jerusalem fell.
[1510.34 --> 1511.48]  Tear it down, they cried.
[1511.58 --> 1512.96]  Tear it down to its foundations.
[1513.94 --> 1516.62]  O daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,
[1517.34 --> 1520.52]  happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us,
[1521.04 --> 1522.64]  he who seizes your infants
[1522.64 --> 1525.20]  and dashes them against the rocks.
[1526.38 --> 1529.00]  This, too, is the word of the Lord.
[1529.00 --> 1534.48]  Let's pray.
[1536.02 --> 1538.88]  Our Father, we thank you for these words,
[1539.44 --> 1542.34]  which we pray will sink deep into our souls.
[1543.52 --> 1546.50]  Teach us this morning more about who you are.
[1547.32 --> 1550.88]  Help us to see and savor our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1550.96 --> 1553.36]  And we pray in his name and for his sake.
[1553.66 --> 1554.00]  Amen.
[1554.00 --> 1554.08]  Amen.
[1555.92 --> 1560.18]  So, Psalm 137 is kind of one of those psalms,
[1560.26 --> 1561.44]  maybe like Psalm 23,
[1561.80 --> 1564.56]  that has found kind of a resonance
[1564.56 --> 1566.36]  outside of the church.
[1567.54 --> 1571.60]  And this week, as I was looking at Wikipedia
[1571.60 --> 1574.04]  and looking at all the cultural references
[1574.04 --> 1576.40]  that refer to this psalm,
[1576.62 --> 1578.02]  one of them I came across,
[1578.08 --> 1579.50]  and I watched this video on YouTube,
[1580.06 --> 1581.22]  of Don McLean.
[1581.22 --> 1582.56]  Do you guys know Don McLean?
[1582.86 --> 1584.08]  He sings American Pie.
[1584.20 --> 1585.10]  It's kind of his famous song.
[1585.88 --> 1588.88]  Well, so the video is of him standing on a stage
[1588.88 --> 1590.46]  in a packed out theater,
[1591.16 --> 1592.74]  just him and his banjo,
[1593.34 --> 1597.02]  holding the entire audience spellbound
[1597.02 --> 1602.36]  as he got them all to sing a three-part song around
[1602.36 --> 1606.84]  with words based on Psalm 137.
[1606.84 --> 1609.46]  So what I want to do is I just want to play
[1609.46 --> 1612.38]  about a minute of that song for you,
[1612.44 --> 1614.58]  and we're going to have the words up there on the screen
[1614.58 --> 1616.02]  so you can sing it along.
[1616.64 --> 1617.48]  Okay, so here it is.
[1617.48 --> 1620.38]  You sing with me, okay?
[1620.38 --> 1630.38]  By the waters, the waters of Babylon,
[1631.44 --> 1637.78]  we lay down and west and west,
[1637.78 --> 1640.94]  for thee Zion.
[1641.64 --> 1644.76]  We remember thee,
[1645.00 --> 1647.38]  remember thee,
[1647.78 --> 1650.86]  remember thee Zion.
[1650.86 --> 1664.18]  So I thought,
[1664.36 --> 1665.54]  why don't we do it one more time,
[1665.88 --> 1668.30]  and if you would like to, sing along.
[1668.88 --> 1669.54]  Okay, let's try it.
[1671.86 --> 1673.18]  You sing with me, okay?
[1673.18 --> 1683.18]  By the waters, the waters of Babylon,
[1684.24 --> 1690.58]  we lay down and west and west,
[1690.58 --> 1693.18]  for thee Zion.
[1693.18 --> 1697.56]  We remember thee,
[1697.56 --> 1700.18]  remember thee,
[1700.18 --> 1703.64]  remember thee Zion.
[1703.64 --> 1717.66]  So it's, you know,
[1717.66 --> 1718.74]  it's a musical rendering
[1718.74 --> 1721.20]  of really only the first line or two
[1721.20 --> 1722.18]  of our psalm,
[1722.22 --> 1723.80]  but I think it so beautifully captures
[1723.80 --> 1727.62]  the emotions of Psalm 137.
[1727.94 --> 1729.52]  See, the people of God
[1729.52 --> 1731.22]  are in exile in Babylon.
[1731.22 --> 1733.72]  They have been defeated in war
[1733.72 --> 1735.50]  and they are weeping.
[1736.54 --> 1738.34]  Their capital city of Jerusalem
[1738.34 --> 1739.56]  was taken.
[1740.16 --> 1742.50]  Their temple was destroyed.
[1743.30 --> 1744.54]  The Babylonian army
[1744.54 --> 1746.56]  broke through the walls of the city.
[1746.66 --> 1747.86]  They came pouring in
[1747.86 --> 1749.46]  and they pillaged
[1749.46 --> 1750.30]  and they destroyed.
[1750.74 --> 1752.16]  They set fire to the city,
[1752.28 --> 1755.68]  burning homes and buildings to ash.
[1756.10 --> 1757.44]  They killed people,
[1758.10 --> 1759.76]  women and men, young and old.
[1759.76 --> 1761.24]  And they,
[1761.48 --> 1763.68]  then they put thousands of them
[1763.68 --> 1764.48]  in chains
[1764.48 --> 1766.56]  and took them on a long march
[1766.56 --> 1767.42]  into exile
[1767.42 --> 1769.52]  in the faraway land of Babylon
[1769.52 --> 1771.78]  in what is now modern day Iraq.
[1772.54 --> 1774.04]  And they sit now
[1774.04 --> 1775.54]  by the rivers,
[1775.68 --> 1777.52]  by the waters of Babylon
[1777.52 --> 1778.78]  and weep.
[1779.92 --> 1781.46]  And so look with me at verse one.
[1783.32 --> 1785.54]  By the rivers of Babylon,
[1785.76 --> 1787.18]  we sat and wept
[1787.18 --> 1789.38]  when we remembered Zion.
[1790.00 --> 1793.14]  So Zion had many waterways,
[1793.34 --> 1795.56]  both natural and man-made,
[1796.16 --> 1798.14]  scattered across the plains of Babylon.
[1798.72 --> 1801.44]  And they function as a massive irrigation system
[1801.44 --> 1802.34]  for the whole region.
[1802.98 --> 1804.10]  Probably kind of similar
[1804.10 --> 1805.00]  to what we have in Delta
[1805.00 --> 1806.36]  with these irrigation channels
[1806.36 --> 1807.32]  that, you know,
[1807.38 --> 1809.38]  kind of cut through the fields
[1809.38 --> 1810.68]  in order to water the fields.
[1810.68 --> 1813.20]  And these waterways
[1813.20 --> 1815.42]  fed by the Tigris
[1815.42 --> 1816.82]  and the Euphrates rivers
[1816.82 --> 1818.98]  made this otherwise
[1818.98 --> 1820.38]  very barren place
[1820.38 --> 1822.76]  actually wonderfully fertile.
[1824.26 --> 1824.88]  And so, you know,
[1824.90 --> 1826.34]  through human ingenuity
[1826.34 --> 1827.78]  and civilization,
[1828.26 --> 1829.98]  they had tamed the forces of nature,
[1830.78 --> 1832.76]  producing fairly regular harvests.
[1833.24 --> 1835.86]  And then with a secure food supply
[1835.86 --> 1837.94]  came a measure of prosperity
[1837.94 --> 1839.30]  and high culture.
[1840.44 --> 1841.10]  And so Babylon,
[1841.36 --> 1842.08]  like Egypt,
[1842.76 --> 1843.94]  if you were living
[1843.94 --> 1844.88]  in the ancient world,
[1845.00 --> 1847.08]  that was a great place to live.
[1847.70 --> 1848.86]  Everyone would have heard
[1848.86 --> 1850.36]  of the tales of,
[1850.44 --> 1850.56]  you know,
[1850.60 --> 1852.08]  the bountiful vineyards,
[1852.40 --> 1853.94]  the hanging gardens,
[1854.80 --> 1855.76]  the literature,
[1856.86 --> 1857.60]  the buildings.
[1858.22 --> 1859.50]  It was a flourishing place.
[1860.20 --> 1861.74]  And the goal of Babylon
[1861.74 --> 1862.66]  as they, you know,
[1862.70 --> 1864.00]  expanded their empire
[1864.00 --> 1865.80]  and conquered smaller nations
[1865.80 --> 1867.22]  like the Israelites.
[1867.78 --> 1869.48]  Their goal was to assimilate them
[1869.48 --> 1870.90]  into Babylonian culture
[1870.90 --> 1872.86]  so that they would become
[1872.86 --> 1874.82]  well-adjusted citizens.
[1876.08 --> 1878.40]  And they promised these people
[1878.40 --> 1879.82]  the good life.
[1881.34 --> 1881.52]  You know,
[1881.58 --> 1883.26]  before the Babylonians did this,
[1883.58 --> 1884.38]  the Assyrians
[1884.38 --> 1885.92]  did the same thing.
[1886.64 --> 1888.40]  So when the Assyrian king,
[1888.50 --> 1889.92]  King Sennacherib,
[1890.10 --> 1891.42]  he came against Jerusalem
[1891.42 --> 1892.56]  in 701 BC
[1892.56 --> 1894.96]  and he sent some delegates
[1894.96 --> 1897.42]  to go to try to persuade
[1897.42 --> 1898.86]  the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1898.86 --> 1900.84]  to just surrender to him.
[1901.58 --> 1902.96]  And this is what is recorded
[1902.96 --> 1904.28]  in 2 Kings 18.
[1905.86 --> 1906.68]  He said,
[1906.92 --> 1908.28]  do not listen to Hezekiah,
[1908.54 --> 1910.82]  the king of Israel or Judah.
[1911.36 --> 1913.76]  This is what the king of Assyria says.
[1914.12 --> 1915.34]  Make peace with me
[1915.34 --> 1916.34]  and come out to me.
[1916.58 --> 1917.40]  I will take you
[1917.40 --> 1918.72]  to a land of grain
[1918.72 --> 1919.94]  and new wine,
[1920.34 --> 1921.44]  a land of bread
[1921.44 --> 1922.08]  and vineyards,
[1922.16 --> 1923.40]  a land of olive trees
[1923.40 --> 1924.48]  and honey.
[1925.82 --> 1927.52]  Do not listen to Hezekiah
[1927.52 --> 1929.32]  for he is misleading you
[1929.32 --> 1929.98]  when he says,
[1930.40 --> 1932.30]  the Lord will deliver us.
[1934.18 --> 1937.02]  So what's the king of Assyria?
[1937.38 --> 1938.20]  What does he say?
[1938.28 --> 1939.04]  The people of Jerusalem?
[1939.34 --> 1939.78]  He says,
[1939.92 --> 1940.84]  trust me.
[1941.42 --> 1941.64]  Right?
[1941.70 --> 1943.44]  I am doing you a favor.
[1944.44 --> 1945.80]  Come and join us.
[1946.50 --> 1947.12]  I'll take you
[1947.12 --> 1948.62]  to a new promised land.
[1948.94 --> 1949.06]  Right?
[1949.14 --> 1951.12]  Forget the Lord your God.
[1951.12 --> 1952.18]  He's not going to save you.
[1952.30 --> 1953.28]  Give up your identity.
[1953.84 --> 1954.76]  Give up your faith.
[1955.06 --> 1956.48]  Become like us.
[1958.02 --> 1959.24]  And it's a very,
[1959.36 --> 1962.90]  very seductive invitation
[1962.90 --> 1965.34]  embraced by many people
[1965.34 --> 1967.44]  way back in Israel.
[1967.70 --> 1968.68]  And we know that
[1968.68 --> 1971.06]  because 70 years later
[1971.06 --> 1972.40]  after the people
[1972.40 --> 1973.60]  were brought into exile,
[1973.84 --> 1975.14]  when they had the opportunity
[1975.14 --> 1976.84]  to return back to their land,
[1977.14 --> 1977.86]  the land of Judah,
[1977.86 --> 1978.26]  Judah,
[1978.26 --> 1979.60]  not everyone went back.
[1980.44 --> 1981.22]  Not all of them
[1981.22 --> 1982.02]  wanted to go.
[1983.70 --> 1984.20]  You know,
[1984.26 --> 1985.40]  and it was exactly the same
[1985.40 --> 1986.14]  in the New Testament.
[1987.08 --> 1987.32]  You know,
[1987.36 --> 1988.32]  with the early Christians,
[1988.42 --> 1989.04]  they're struggling
[1989.04 --> 1989.82]  to work out,
[1989.96 --> 1990.92]  how do we live
[1990.92 --> 1992.80]  as the people of God
[1992.80 --> 1995.60]  in this Roman Empire
[1995.60 --> 1997.42]  that is very against
[1997.42 --> 1998.64]  the kingdom of God?
[1999.42 --> 2000.32]  And the apostles,
[2000.60 --> 2001.02]  in the writings
[2001.02 --> 2001.76]  of the New Testament,
[2001.96 --> 2003.56]  they instructed the Christians
[2003.56 --> 2004.70]  to live as if
[2004.70 --> 2005.88]  they were exiles
[2005.88 --> 2007.22]  in a foreign land.
[2007.82 --> 2008.70]  And to remember
[2008.70 --> 2010.40]  that they were not yet home.
[2010.72 --> 2011.74]  They were not to make
[2011.74 --> 2013.80]  Rome their home
[2013.80 --> 2014.92]  because they were,
[2015.70 --> 2016.80]  they belonged to God's kingdom.
[2018.20 --> 2018.90]  And in fact,
[2018.96 --> 2019.08]  you know,
[2019.12 --> 2020.08]  the New Testament writers,
[2020.28 --> 2021.16]  they portray
[2021.16 --> 2022.46]  the Roman Empire
[2022.46 --> 2024.52]  as a kind of Babylon.
[2025.52 --> 2026.92]  A worldly city
[2026.92 --> 2028.18]  that is opposed to God
[2028.18 --> 2030.20]  and that is to be resisted.
[2030.20 --> 2032.96]  And the thing is,
[2033.04 --> 2033.30]  friends,
[2034.04 --> 2036.00]  this seduction of Babylon,
[2036.46 --> 2038.28]  it lives on,
[2038.80 --> 2039.68]  even to today.
[2040.02 --> 2040.20]  You know,
[2040.26 --> 2040.84]  and we feel it.
[2040.90 --> 2042.24]  We feel the pressure
[2042.24 --> 2044.14]  to live out
[2044.14 --> 2045.16]  our Christian lives
[2045.16 --> 2045.70]  in a world,
[2045.80 --> 2046.34]  in a culture
[2046.34 --> 2047.54]  that offers us
[2047.54 --> 2049.00]  respect,
[2049.40 --> 2050.04]  credibility,
[2050.28 --> 2050.80]  acceptance,
[2050.80 --> 2053.00]  if only we will buy
[2053.00 --> 2054.56]  into their vision
[2054.56 --> 2055.68]  of reality.
[2057.34 --> 2058.12]  And that's why
[2058.12 --> 2060.08]  we need Psalm 137.
[2061.20 --> 2062.66]  Because Psalm 137,
[2062.74 --> 2063.40]  I think what it does
[2063.40 --> 2064.08]  is it hints
[2064.08 --> 2065.60]  at three ways
[2065.60 --> 2066.58]  or three practices
[2066.58 --> 2068.16]  that will help us
[2068.16 --> 2069.56]  to live as exiles
[2069.56 --> 2071.24]  in a strange land
[2071.24 --> 2072.42]  and to stay
[2072.42 --> 2073.52]  on the pilgrim path
[2073.52 --> 2074.32]  as God's people
[2074.32 --> 2075.86]  and not to wander off of it.
[2076.70 --> 2077.48]  And these practices
[2077.48 --> 2078.32]  we find here
[2078.32 --> 2079.60]  are remembering,
[2080.54 --> 2080.94]  resisting,
[2081.80 --> 2082.34]  and resting.
[2082.90 --> 2083.48]  Okay, remembering,
[2083.70 --> 2084.46]  resisting, and resting.
[2084.58 --> 2085.14]  So we're just going to look
[2085.14 --> 2085.76]  at each of these.
[2086.68 --> 2087.48]  First one,
[2087.96 --> 2089.46]  let's look at this practice
[2089.46 --> 2090.80]  of remembering.
[2093.20 --> 2094.18]  What was it
[2094.18 --> 2094.82]  that led
[2094.82 --> 2096.38]  the psalmist
[2096.38 --> 2097.54]  and those who were with him,
[2097.78 --> 2099.08]  this group of Israelites,
[2100.08 --> 2101.76]  to notice
[2101.76 --> 2103.16]  not the prosperity
[2103.16 --> 2104.08]  of Babylon
[2104.08 --> 2104.86]  all around them,
[2104.92 --> 2105.92]  not the high culture,
[2106.06 --> 2107.50]  not the good food
[2107.50 --> 2108.08]  and wine,
[2108.92 --> 2109.92]  but to notice
[2109.92 --> 2110.78]  that it was not
[2110.78 --> 2111.22]  their home.
[2112.34 --> 2113.08]  And the answer
[2113.08 --> 2113.58]  to that
[2113.58 --> 2114.36]  is very simple.
[2114.36 --> 2115.76]  they remembered.
[2116.86 --> 2117.56]  They remembered.
[2118.10 --> 2119.10]  And memory,
[2119.24 --> 2119.88]  rather than what
[2119.88 --> 2120.56]  they can see
[2120.56 --> 2121.78]  and touch around them,
[2122.38 --> 2123.26]  is what shaped
[2123.26 --> 2124.36]  their identity,
[2124.54 --> 2125.04]  is what shaped
[2125.04 --> 2125.64]  their thinking.
[2126.44 --> 2126.62]  Right?
[2126.64 --> 2127.28]  They remembered
[2127.28 --> 2128.76]  where they had come from.
[2128.82 --> 2129.32]  They remembered
[2129.32 --> 2130.52]  who they were.
[2131.78 --> 2132.34]  And so look at,
[2132.44 --> 2132.60]  again,
[2132.64 --> 2133.54]  at verse one with me.
[2135.00 --> 2136.32]  What did they remember?
[2137.32 --> 2138.44]  They remembered
[2138.44 --> 2139.56]  Zion.
[2140.18 --> 2141.20]  Zion is another
[2141.20 --> 2142.22]  name for
[2142.22 --> 2142.98]  Jerusalem.
[2142.98 --> 2143.10]  Jerusalem.
[2144.10 --> 2144.20]  Right?
[2144.26 --> 2145.08]  And so this language
[2145.08 --> 2146.32]  of remember
[2146.32 --> 2147.44]  Jerusalem,
[2147.78 --> 2148.86]  it makes a little bit
[2148.86 --> 2149.56]  more sense
[2149.56 --> 2150.52]  when we look
[2150.52 --> 2151.14]  further down
[2151.14 --> 2152.20]  at verse six.
[2152.86 --> 2153.02]  Okay,
[2153.02 --> 2153.92]  let's look at verse six.
[2154.38 --> 2154.64]  It says,
[2154.92 --> 2155.76]  may my tongue
[2155.76 --> 2156.60]  cling to the roof
[2156.60 --> 2157.22]  of my mouth
[2157.22 --> 2158.54]  if I do not remember you,
[2158.84 --> 2160.54]  if I do not consider
[2160.54 --> 2161.40]  Jerusalem
[2161.40 --> 2163.58]  my highest joy.
[2166.00 --> 2166.96]  They say
[2166.96 --> 2167.66]  that Jerusalem
[2167.66 --> 2168.60]  should be considered
[2168.60 --> 2169.38]  as what?
[2170.46 --> 2171.70]  As their highest joy.
[2172.22 --> 2172.38]  Right?
[2172.38 --> 2173.44]  They are weeping
[2173.44 --> 2175.06]  because they have lost
[2175.06 --> 2176.48]  their highest joy.
[2178.82 --> 2179.34]  Now,
[2179.54 --> 2180.92]  I have lived in
[2180.92 --> 2182.44]  several different places
[2182.44 --> 2183.18]  in my life.
[2184.10 --> 2185.38]  Each place I have lived
[2185.38 --> 2186.74]  has become special to me.
[2187.16 --> 2187.58]  Right?
[2187.66 --> 2188.56]  In different ways.
[2188.70 --> 2189.58]  But I would never say,
[2189.68 --> 2190.38]  like where I live now
[2190.38 --> 2190.72]  in Richmond,
[2191.08 --> 2193.24]  Richmond is my highest joy.
[2193.88 --> 2194.64]  I wouldn't say that.
[2194.72 --> 2195.42]  Would you say Ladner
[2195.42 --> 2196.44]  is your highest joy?
[2197.16 --> 2198.48]  Or maybe your hometown?
[2199.16 --> 2199.42]  Maybe.
[2199.42 --> 2199.64]  I mean,
[2199.64 --> 2199.78]  sure,
[2199.82 --> 2200.58]  we have very strong
[2200.58 --> 2201.54]  sentimental feelings
[2201.54 --> 2202.38]  about where we're from.
[2203.34 --> 2204.68]  But what's the deal
[2204.68 --> 2205.40]  with Jerusalem
[2205.40 --> 2207.40]  being my highest joy?
[2208.74 --> 2208.98]  Well,
[2209.02 --> 2209.46]  the psalmist
[2209.46 --> 2210.66]  is actually not talking
[2210.66 --> 2212.08]  about a city per se,
[2212.52 --> 2214.98]  but what Jerusalem
[2214.98 --> 2216.12]  stands for,
[2216.20 --> 2217.06]  what it means.
[2217.58 --> 2218.94]  And what it means
[2218.94 --> 2220.22]  is the presence of God.
[2220.22 --> 2222.66]  Jerusalem was special
[2222.66 --> 2224.30]  because that's where
[2224.30 --> 2225.98]  God chose to dwell.
[2226.84 --> 2226.96]  Right?
[2227.02 --> 2228.74]  To have his special presence
[2228.74 --> 2229.48]  with his people.
[2229.80 --> 2230.96]  If God lives anywhere,
[2231.38 --> 2232.52]  that's where he lives.
[2232.54 --> 2233.42]  He lives in Jerusalem.
[2234.10 --> 2236.04]  That's where the temple was.
[2236.16 --> 2236.28]  Right?
[2236.32 --> 2237.68]  And where the temple is,
[2237.98 --> 2240.14]  there is forgiveness of sins.
[2241.02 --> 2242.16]  And in the temple
[2242.16 --> 2243.70]  was kept the law.
[2244.26 --> 2245.98]  And the law was God's gift
[2245.98 --> 2246.68]  to his people
[2246.68 --> 2248.02]  to teach them how to live
[2248.02 --> 2249.62]  as the people of God.
[2249.62 --> 2251.28]  And so that's why
[2251.28 --> 2252.36]  the psalmist talks about
[2252.36 --> 2253.30]  Jerusalem
[2253.30 --> 2256.22]  as its highest joy.
[2256.32 --> 2257.50]  It's the presence of God.
[2257.80 --> 2258.92]  It's forgiveness of sins.
[2259.20 --> 2260.48]  It's the good law of the Lord.
[2261.50 --> 2262.56]  And the very reason
[2262.56 --> 2263.54]  why God allowed
[2263.54 --> 2264.30]  the Babylonians
[2264.30 --> 2265.86]  to take them into exile
[2265.86 --> 2268.78]  is because for a long time
[2268.78 --> 2270.42]  God's presence
[2270.42 --> 2272.60]  was not their highest joy.
[2273.76 --> 2275.44]  They didn't remember
[2275.44 --> 2276.82]  God's presence
[2276.82 --> 2278.20]  even when they were
[2278.20 --> 2278.88]  in Jerusalem.
[2279.62 --> 2279.84]  Right?
[2279.88 --> 2280.36]  They forgot.
[2280.46 --> 2281.30]  They forgot God.
[2281.80 --> 2282.82]  They were seduced
[2282.82 --> 2283.62]  by the idols
[2283.62 --> 2284.86]  of their surrounding neighbors.
[2285.80 --> 2287.24]  They no longer set God
[2287.24 --> 2288.28]  as their highest joy.
[2289.52 --> 2290.26]  And that's why
[2290.26 --> 2291.76]  if we look together
[2291.76 --> 2293.38]  at verses 5 and 6,
[2294.38 --> 2294.80]  the psalmist,
[2294.90 --> 2295.30]  what he does
[2295.30 --> 2296.16]  is he brings down
[2296.16 --> 2297.08]  a curse
[2297.08 --> 2298.60]  on himself
[2298.60 --> 2300.08]  if he should forget
[2300.08 --> 2300.86]  Jerusalem.
[2300.86 --> 2302.26]  So he says,
[2302.26 --> 2304.98]  if I forget you Jerusalem,
[2305.34 --> 2307.06]  may my right hand
[2307.06 --> 2308.26]  forget its skill,
[2308.48 --> 2309.54]  may my tongue
[2309.54 --> 2310.48]  cling to the roof
[2310.48 --> 2311.04]  of my mouth
[2311.04 --> 2312.14]  if I do not remember you,
[2312.36 --> 2313.52]  if I do not consider
[2313.52 --> 2314.94]  Jerusalem my highest joy.
[2316.30 --> 2316.46]  Right?
[2316.52 --> 2317.04]  So the psalmist
[2317.04 --> 2318.72]  pronounces curses
[2318.72 --> 2319.92]  on his own hands
[2319.92 --> 2320.76]  and his tongue
[2320.76 --> 2322.54]  if he should forget.
[2323.64 --> 2324.14]  Right?
[2324.24 --> 2325.34]  If the actions
[2325.34 --> 2326.22]  of his hands,
[2326.54 --> 2327.00]  the speech
[2327.00 --> 2327.92]  of his mouth
[2327.92 --> 2329.72]  are not filled
[2329.72 --> 2331.08]  with God
[2331.08 --> 2332.68]  as his highest joy
[2332.68 --> 2333.80]  if they're not
[2333.80 --> 2335.12]  consistent with his faith,
[2335.26 --> 2336.42]  if they do not reflect
[2336.42 --> 2338.56]  where his treasure lies.
[2340.34 --> 2341.80]  And that the greatest treasure,
[2341.92 --> 2342.60]  the greatest joy
[2342.60 --> 2343.20]  of his heart
[2343.20 --> 2344.46]  is to be in God's presence,
[2344.58 --> 2345.40]  to worship God,
[2345.52 --> 2347.66]  to belong to God.
[2349.02 --> 2349.76]  And friends,
[2349.92 --> 2350.96]  we too
[2350.96 --> 2351.82]  were made
[2351.82 --> 2353.42]  for the presence of God.
[2354.74 --> 2355.24]  Right?
[2355.32 --> 2355.92]  You and I,
[2355.92 --> 2357.04]  we were made to live
[2357.04 --> 2358.02]  in his presence.
[2358.46 --> 2359.46]  We were made to
[2359.46 --> 2360.96]  find our life
[2360.96 --> 2362.08]  in him.
[2362.92 --> 2364.06]  We were made to have God
[2364.06 --> 2365.08]  as our greatest joy.
[2365.60 --> 2366.28]  So the object
[2366.28 --> 2367.50]  of our greatest desire.
[2369.14 --> 2370.10]  And so,
[2370.34 --> 2372.38]  let us not be seduced
[2372.38 --> 2373.92]  by the culture around us
[2373.92 --> 2374.56]  that tells us
[2374.56 --> 2376.30]  that we can find joy
[2376.30 --> 2377.22]  and we can find life
[2377.22 --> 2377.94]  in things
[2377.94 --> 2378.78]  that the world
[2378.78 --> 2379.42]  would offer us
[2379.42 --> 2380.24]  that are not God.
[2382.22 --> 2383.22]  So let's remember
[2383.22 --> 2383.96]  who we are.
[2384.46 --> 2384.58]  Right?
[2384.60 --> 2385.10]  Let's remember
[2385.10 --> 2386.74]  who we belong to.
[2387.92 --> 2388.84]  And one of the ways
[2388.84 --> 2389.92]  that we do that,
[2390.46 --> 2390.60]  right,
[2390.66 --> 2391.74]  remembering our identity
[2391.74 --> 2393.08]  as sons and daughters
[2393.08 --> 2393.66]  of God
[2393.66 --> 2395.12]  and as exiles
[2395.12 --> 2396.14]  in a foreign land,
[2396.56 --> 2397.54]  one of the ways
[2397.54 --> 2398.02]  we do that
[2398.02 --> 2398.68]  is individually
[2398.68 --> 2399.56]  we can reflect
[2399.56 --> 2400.28]  on scripture,
[2400.48 --> 2401.22]  we can pray,
[2402.06 --> 2403.22]  and then we do it together
[2403.22 --> 2404.44]  by like what we're doing
[2404.44 --> 2404.90]  right now.
[2405.10 --> 2405.78]  Coming together
[2405.78 --> 2406.28]  on a Sunday,
[2406.48 --> 2407.50]  worshiping God together,
[2408.32 --> 2409.36]  listening to his word,
[2409.80 --> 2411.16]  celebrating the sacraments,
[2411.16 --> 2413.38]  encouraging one another
[2413.38 --> 2414.78]  to find our greatest joy
[2414.78 --> 2415.34]  in God.
[2416.84 --> 2417.90]  That's what will help us
[2417.90 --> 2419.52]  to live as exiles.
[2421.52 --> 2422.00]  Then,
[2422.10 --> 2422.34]  you know,
[2422.44 --> 2423.68]  remembering puts us
[2423.68 --> 2424.74]  in a very good position,
[2424.90 --> 2425.28]  secondly,
[2425.62 --> 2426.64]  to resist.
[2427.36 --> 2427.52]  Okay,
[2427.52 --> 2428.40]  so that's our second
[2428.40 --> 2429.48]  spiritual practice
[2429.48 --> 2430.94]  is resisting.
[2430.94 --> 2432.38]  Now,
[2432.52 --> 2433.14]  the psalmist
[2433.14 --> 2434.28]  and his friends
[2434.28 --> 2436.56]  in remembering Zion,
[2437.76 --> 2438.32]  it helps them
[2438.32 --> 2439.00]  to see clearly
[2439.00 --> 2440.06]  how they are to live
[2440.06 --> 2442.00]  in their present circumstances.
[2442.98 --> 2443.68]  And part of how
[2443.68 --> 2444.46]  we are to live
[2444.46 --> 2445.32]  as pilgrims,
[2445.44 --> 2446.08]  as exiles,
[2446.22 --> 2446.76]  as strangers,
[2447.70 --> 2449.12]  seeking our true home
[2449.12 --> 2450.16]  in the kingdom of God,
[2451.24 --> 2451.88]  some part of how
[2451.88 --> 2452.66]  that is to live
[2452.66 --> 2453.48]  is to resist.
[2454.22 --> 2454.32]  Okay,
[2454.38 --> 2454.84]  and so
[2454.84 --> 2456.30]  what does
[2456.30 --> 2457.20]  the psalmist
[2457.20 --> 2457.94]  here resist?
[2459.10 --> 2460.02]  Let's take a look
[2460.02 --> 2461.06]  at verses 2 to 4.
[2463.20 --> 2464.98]  There on the poplars
[2464.98 --> 2466.82]  we hung our harps,
[2467.54 --> 2468.76]  for there our captors
[2468.76 --> 2470.04]  asked us for songs
[2470.04 --> 2471.34]  our tormentors
[2471.34 --> 2472.30]  demanded,
[2472.52 --> 2473.36]  songs of joy.
[2473.66 --> 2474.04]  They said,
[2474.42 --> 2475.68]  sing us one of the songs
[2475.68 --> 2476.28]  of Zion.
[2477.18 --> 2478.50]  How can we sing
[2478.50 --> 2479.96]  the songs of the Lord
[2479.96 --> 2481.50]  while in a foreign land?
[2482.78 --> 2483.90]  So here we have
[2483.90 --> 2485.44]  these Babylonian captors
[2485.44 --> 2488.20]  kind of like mocking,
[2488.70 --> 2489.10]  teasing,
[2489.10 --> 2490.16]  provoking
[2490.16 --> 2492.16]  the Israelites,
[2492.36 --> 2493.36]  demanding them
[2493.36 --> 2495.28]  to forget their pain,
[2495.42 --> 2496.98]  forget their suffering,
[2497.12 --> 2498.40]  and to party,
[2499.00 --> 2499.42]  essentially.
[2500.42 --> 2500.64]  Right?
[2500.70 --> 2500.96]  They say,
[2501.06 --> 2502.74]  sing us songs of joy.
[2503.36 --> 2503.52]  Right?
[2503.58 --> 2503.98]  Come on,
[2504.06 --> 2504.90]  get rid of those
[2504.90 --> 2506.08]  negative vibes.
[2507.34 --> 2508.50]  Get with the program.
[2508.88 --> 2509.98]  Stop looking back.
[2510.28 --> 2511.72]  Start looking forward.
[2511.72 --> 2511.84]  God.
[2513.04 --> 2515.26]  But remembering who they are
[2515.26 --> 2516.14]  as God's people
[2516.14 --> 2517.82]  as exiles
[2517.82 --> 2519.42]  enables them to resist.
[2520.52 --> 2521.10]  And so what they do
[2521.10 --> 2521.70]  is pretty funny.
[2522.46 --> 2523.38]  It's pretty rebellious.
[2523.48 --> 2524.66]  They take their harps,
[2524.74 --> 2525.26]  their lyres,
[2525.40 --> 2526.32]  and they hang them up
[2526.32 --> 2526.98]  into trees,
[2526.98 --> 2528.54]  and they're like,
[2528.60 --> 2529.34]  you want some music?
[2529.98 --> 2530.72]  Go climb a tree.
[2530.72 --> 2532.84]  I like that.
[2533.88 --> 2534.74]  It's a gesture
[2534.74 --> 2535.88]  of defiance,
[2536.32 --> 2536.94]  resistance,
[2537.78 --> 2539.58]  because they realize
[2539.58 --> 2541.32]  that weeping
[2541.32 --> 2542.70]  is a far more
[2542.70 --> 2543.78]  appropriate response
[2544.44 --> 2545.32]  to their situation
[2545.32 --> 2546.26]  than partying.
[2547.32 --> 2548.08]  And so they hung up
[2548.08 --> 2548.64]  their harps,
[2548.88 --> 2549.78]  they refused
[2549.78 --> 2551.12]  to play along,
[2551.56 --> 2552.46]  they resisted.
[2552.46 --> 2555.36]  Perhaps they also
[2555.36 --> 2556.24]  realized
[2556.24 --> 2557.18]  the importance
[2557.18 --> 2559.98]  even for their captors
[2559.98 --> 2561.60]  of not giving in
[2561.60 --> 2563.36]  to a worldview
[2563.36 --> 2565.12]  that doesn't have God
[2565.12 --> 2566.12]  as the center of it.
[2566.62 --> 2566.74]  Right?
[2566.88 --> 2568.82]  They saw the importance
[2568.82 --> 2570.54]  of keeping alive
[2570.54 --> 2572.14]  a true version of reality,
[2572.24 --> 2573.24]  a true story
[2573.24 --> 2574.72]  of reality
[2574.72 --> 2575.38]  that someday
[2575.38 --> 2576.68]  might subvert
[2576.68 --> 2577.90]  and undermine
[2577.90 --> 2579.78]  the false stories
[2579.78 --> 2581.00]  that were being told
[2581.00 --> 2581.80]  by a powerful
[2581.80 --> 2583.36]  and smug culture.
[2585.00 --> 2585.38]  You know,
[2585.44 --> 2586.80]  there's another character
[2586.80 --> 2588.58]  that we read about
[2588.58 --> 2589.10]  in the Bible
[2589.10 --> 2590.56]  who was part
[2590.56 --> 2591.20]  of the exile.
[2591.90 --> 2593.10]  He also was brought
[2593.10 --> 2593.90]  to Babylon
[2593.90 --> 2595.36]  along with the psalmist
[2595.36 --> 2596.54]  and those with him,
[2597.34 --> 2598.70]  and his name is Daniel.
[2599.98 --> 2600.34]  You know,
[2600.42 --> 2601.66]  Daniel and his friends,
[2602.34 --> 2603.48]  they were brought
[2603.48 --> 2605.22]  into the royal palace,
[2605.96 --> 2607.38]  into the king's service,
[2607.58 --> 2608.78]  and his story
[2608.78 --> 2610.08]  gives us a great example
[2610.08 --> 2611.04]  of what
[2611.04 --> 2613.32]  respectful resistance
[2613.32 --> 2614.76]  to the empire
[2614.76 --> 2615.48]  looks like
[2615.48 --> 2617.64]  for a believing person.
[2618.74 --> 2618.90]  You know,
[2618.96 --> 2619.32]  Daniel,
[2619.46 --> 2620.06]  he was taught
[2620.06 --> 2620.66]  the language
[2620.66 --> 2621.42]  and the literature
[2621.42 --> 2622.82]  of the Babylonians,
[2623.00 --> 2624.90]  and he served
[2624.90 --> 2626.50]  the king of Babylon
[2626.50 --> 2627.66]  very well.
[2628.12 --> 2628.74]  So well,
[2628.82 --> 2629.18]  in fact,
[2629.24 --> 2630.40]  that this is what it says
[2630.40 --> 2632.18]  in Daniel chapter 1,
[2632.26 --> 2633.20]  verses 19 to 20.
[2633.90 --> 2635.22]  The king talked to them,
[2635.22 --> 2635.88]  and he found
[2635.88 --> 2637.78]  none equal to Daniel,
[2638.38 --> 2639.00]  Hananiah,
[2639.32 --> 2639.78]  Mishael,
[2640.08 --> 2640.82]  and Azariah.
[2641.48 --> 2642.58]  So they entered
[2642.58 --> 2643.58]  the king's service.
[2644.24 --> 2645.48]  In every matter
[2645.48 --> 2646.22]  of wisdom
[2646.22 --> 2647.16]  and understanding
[2647.16 --> 2648.18]  about which the king
[2648.18 --> 2648.76]  questioned them,
[2648.94 --> 2649.56]  he found them
[2649.56 --> 2651.16]  ten times better
[2651.16 --> 2653.26]  than all the magicians
[2653.26 --> 2654.06]  and enchanters
[2654.06 --> 2655.56]  of his whole kingdom.
[2656.56 --> 2657.20]  Right?
[2657.22 --> 2657.66]  It's amazing.
[2657.66 --> 2659.74]  You know,
[2659.80 --> 2661.12]  Daniel and his friends,
[2661.26 --> 2661.62]  I'm not going to say
[2661.62 --> 2662.18]  their names again,
[2662.94 --> 2664.60]  they knew who they were.
[2665.32 --> 2666.26]  They knew that God
[2666.26 --> 2666.96]  had brought them
[2666.96 --> 2667.74]  to this place,
[2668.14 --> 2669.66]  and they served God
[2669.66 --> 2670.50]  and they served
[2670.50 --> 2671.72]  their earthly masters
[2671.72 --> 2673.10]  the best that they could.
[2674.36 --> 2675.66]  But when they were asked
[2675.66 --> 2676.58]  to do contrary
[2676.58 --> 2677.68]  to their faith,
[2677.78 --> 2678.48]  to who they were,
[2678.70 --> 2679.64]  they resisted.
[2680.46 --> 2681.26]  You may remember
[2681.26 --> 2682.06]  when they were,
[2682.30 --> 2682.70]  you know,
[2682.76 --> 2683.36]  they were offered
[2683.36 --> 2685.66]  to eat food
[2685.66 --> 2687.18]  and drink the wine
[2687.18 --> 2689.30]  from the king's table.
[2690.62 --> 2690.86]  I don't know
[2690.86 --> 2691.62]  how many of you
[2691.62 --> 2692.38]  were foodies,
[2693.24 --> 2694.16]  but just think about that.
[2694.98 --> 2696.08]  The best,
[2696.44 --> 2698.18]  the most delicious food
[2698.18 --> 2699.90]  in the entire land,
[2700.20 --> 2702.04]  the most delicious wine
[2702.04 --> 2703.22]  that could be had
[2703.22 --> 2704.54]  was offered to them.
[2705.02 --> 2706.02]  But they turned it down.
[2706.16 --> 2706.92]  They resisted.
[2707.12 --> 2707.82]  They refused.
[2708.46 --> 2708.80]  Why?
[2708.80 --> 2710.26]  Well, because that menu
[2710.26 --> 2712.26]  included ceremonially
[2712.26 --> 2713.54]  unclean foods.
[2714.98 --> 2716.46]  The first portions
[2716.46 --> 2717.84]  of that food
[2717.84 --> 2718.66]  and of the wine
[2718.66 --> 2719.40]  was offered
[2719.40 --> 2720.14]  and poured out
[2720.14 --> 2721.02]  to idols,
[2721.60 --> 2722.50]  to false gods.
[2723.40 --> 2724.36]  And so they ate
[2724.36 --> 2725.62]  only vegetables.
[2726.48 --> 2727.46]  My kids would have loved it.
[2727.70 --> 2728.00]  Just kidding.
[2728.94 --> 2730.00]  They ate only vegetables
[2730.00 --> 2731.44]  because that's the only thing
[2731.44 --> 2732.38]  they could eat
[2732.38 --> 2734.26]  and obey God's law.
[2735.22 --> 2736.58]  And God blessed them for it.
[2736.88 --> 2738.00]  And they achieved
[2738.00 --> 2739.46]  great good
[2739.46 --> 2741.16]  through them.
[2742.34 --> 2743.00]  And so resisting,
[2743.18 --> 2743.34]  you know,
[2743.40 --> 2744.28]  we need to think about this.
[2744.42 --> 2745.28]  Resisting is not only
[2745.28 --> 2746.02]  for ourselves
[2746.02 --> 2747.20]  to be done
[2747.20 --> 2748.20]  for our own good,
[2748.28 --> 2748.88]  but even
[2748.88 --> 2750.88]  if it causes us suffering,
[2751.62 --> 2752.38]  resisting what is
[2752.38 --> 2753.54]  contrary to God's word
[2753.54 --> 2754.50]  is something we do
[2754.50 --> 2755.48]  because we love
[2755.48 --> 2755.88]  our neighbors.
[2757.34 --> 2758.34]  So we remember
[2758.34 --> 2760.08]  that we belong to God,
[2760.30 --> 2762.04]  that he is our highest joy,
[2762.04 --> 2763.02]  and we resist
[2763.02 --> 2763.98]  by living out
[2763.98 --> 2764.96]  a subversive,
[2765.30 --> 2765.82]  contrary,
[2766.06 --> 2767.46]  but true story
[2767.46 --> 2768.04]  of reality
[2768.04 --> 2769.14]  in the midst
[2769.14 --> 2770.06]  of the dominant
[2770.06 --> 2771.16]  cultural story
[2771.16 --> 2772.34]  that surrounds us.
[2772.38 --> 2772.94]  That is not
[2772.94 --> 2774.30]  God's story.
[2775.84 --> 2776.76]  And then finally,
[2777.38 --> 2779.20]  to these practices
[2779.20 --> 2780.18]  of remembering
[2780.18 --> 2780.94]  and resisting,
[2781.10 --> 2781.78]  we must add
[2781.78 --> 2783.34]  the final practice.
[2784.34 --> 2785.64]  I had a hard time
[2785.64 --> 2786.64]  to know what to call it.
[2787.10 --> 2788.20]  It had to be with R.
[2788.20 --> 2790.46]  So we're going
[2790.46 --> 2791.16]  to use resting.
[2791.68 --> 2792.16]  Okay, resting.
[2794.44 --> 2795.48]  What do I mean?
[2796.76 --> 2799.20]  We bring our cries
[2799.20 --> 2800.20]  for justice
[2800.20 --> 2802.60]  to God as judge,
[2803.00 --> 2804.26]  and we rest
[2804.26 --> 2805.32]  in his promises
[2805.32 --> 2806.72]  that he will judge
[2806.72 --> 2807.18]  all evil
[2807.18 --> 2808.34]  and he will restore
[2808.34 --> 2809.04]  all things.
[2810.22 --> 2810.98]  Okay, so now,
[2811.22 --> 2812.24]  as we read
[2812.24 --> 2813.20]  this psalm,
[2814.32 --> 2815.90]  especially that last part,
[2815.90 --> 2819.00]  it's a hard passage,
[2819.62 --> 2819.90]  right?
[2821.00 --> 2821.96]  So how are we
[2821.96 --> 2822.94]  to understand this?
[2823.50 --> 2823.94]  How are we
[2823.94 --> 2824.38]  to understand
[2824.38 --> 2825.04]  these verses
[2825.04 --> 2825.84]  that seem
[2825.84 --> 2828.04]  to pray to God
[2828.04 --> 2829.66]  for vengeance,
[2830.26 --> 2832.02]  for retaliation,
[2832.52 --> 2833.56]  for revenge?
[2834.50 --> 2834.86]  What are we
[2834.86 --> 2835.60]  to do with this?
[2836.34 --> 2836.78]  Well, first,
[2836.82 --> 2837.90]  let's try to understand it.
[2838.90 --> 2839.88]  One thing
[2839.88 --> 2840.88]  that's really fascinating
[2840.88 --> 2841.74]  about these verses,
[2842.54 --> 2843.54]  and many commentators
[2843.54 --> 2844.22]  point this out,
[2844.60 --> 2845.86]  is that the psalmist here
[2845.86 --> 2846.80]  is bringing something
[2846.80 --> 2848.00]  like a legal case
[2848.00 --> 2850.42]  against Israel's oppressors
[2850.42 --> 2851.94]  to God as a judge.
[2852.74 --> 2854.14]  It's kind of like a trial.
[2854.52 --> 2856.08]  He's bringing accusations
[2856.08 --> 2858.42]  and a case before God.
[2859.04 --> 2860.28]  So let's look at what he does.
[2860.36 --> 2862.58]  First, he brings his charge,
[2862.64 --> 2863.30]  his accusations,
[2863.72 --> 2864.76]  and there are two of them.
[2865.48 --> 2866.40]  So first, look with me
[2866.40 --> 2866.98]  at verse 7.
[2867.84 --> 2868.12]  It says,
[2868.20 --> 2868.88]  Remember, Lord,
[2868.94 --> 2870.16]  what the Edomites did
[2870.16 --> 2871.58]  on the day Jerusalem fell.
[2872.06 --> 2872.70]  Tear it down,
[2872.76 --> 2873.22]  they cried.
[2873.58 --> 2874.40]  Tear it down
[2874.40 --> 2875.42]  to his foundations.
[2875.42 --> 2876.78]  So now,
[2876.88 --> 2877.64]  who are the Edomites?
[2878.24 --> 2879.30]  Well, the Edomites
[2879.30 --> 2881.06]  are actually Israel's
[2881.06 --> 2882.88]  closest relatives.
[2883.68 --> 2884.66]  They were family.
[2885.44 --> 2886.20]  If you remember
[2886.20 --> 2887.42]  the Genesis story,
[2887.56 --> 2888.34]  there was two brothers,
[2888.54 --> 2890.54]  Jacob and Esau.
[2891.10 --> 2891.96]  But they were not
[2891.96 --> 2892.66]  close brothers.
[2893.64 --> 2894.80]  They fought.
[2895.56 --> 2896.02]  And Jacob
[2896.02 --> 2897.26]  got renamed Israel,
[2897.62 --> 2898.46]  and he was the father
[2898.46 --> 2899.16]  of the Israelites.
[2899.16 --> 2899.34]  Israelites.
[2899.98 --> 2900.90]  And Esau
[2900.90 --> 2901.80]  was the father
[2901.80 --> 2904.44]  of the Edomites.
[2905.68 --> 2906.66]  And the relationship
[2906.66 --> 2907.94]  between these two peoples
[2907.94 --> 2908.98]  just continued
[2908.98 --> 2909.96]  to get worse
[2909.96 --> 2910.72]  and worse
[2910.72 --> 2911.86]  throughout the Bible.
[2912.32 --> 2913.66]  And when the Babylonians
[2913.66 --> 2914.34]  laid siege
[2914.34 --> 2915.10]  to Jerusalem,
[2915.54 --> 2917.36]  this was the final straw
[2917.36 --> 2918.16]  because Edom
[2918.16 --> 2918.90]  stood back
[2918.90 --> 2920.78]  and they cheered
[2920.78 --> 2922.34]  the Babylonians on.
[2923.94 --> 2925.02]  Tear it down
[2925.02 --> 2926.08]  to its foundations.
[2927.86 --> 2928.00]  Right?
[2928.24 --> 2929.02]  So the Edomites,
[2929.08 --> 2929.98]  they should have been
[2929.98 --> 2932.20]  rallying alongside Israel.
[2932.88 --> 2933.40]  They should have been
[2933.40 --> 2934.22]  helping to defend
[2934.22 --> 2934.74]  their brother.
[2934.74 --> 2937.20]  But they betrayed Israel.
[2939.12 --> 2940.14]  Now, second,
[2940.32 --> 2940.74]  the second accusation
[2941.38 --> 2942.92]  is against the Babylonians.
[2943.32 --> 2943.96]  Look at verse 8.
[2945.38 --> 2946.06]  Daughter Babylon,
[2946.32 --> 2947.24]  doomed to destruction,
[2948.12 --> 2948.90]  happy is the one
[2948.90 --> 2949.98]  who repays you
[2949.98 --> 2951.32]  according to what
[2951.32 --> 2951.80]  you have done
[2951.80 --> 2952.48]  to us.
[2952.48 --> 2954.98]  So what was done
[2954.98 --> 2955.48]  to Israel?
[2955.62 --> 2955.98]  Well, you know,
[2956.02 --> 2956.66]  we talked about it
[2956.66 --> 2957.18]  a little bit.
[2957.78 --> 2958.50]  The Babylonians
[2958.50 --> 2959.84]  had destroyed Jerusalem.
[2960.44 --> 2961.42]  They plundered.
[2961.54 --> 2962.24]  They killed.
[2962.74 --> 2963.58]  They didn't kill
[2963.58 --> 2964.26]  just the soldiers
[2964.26 --> 2964.90]  of the city.
[2965.50 --> 2965.98]  Everybody.
[2966.64 --> 2967.68]  All the way down
[2967.68 --> 2968.68]  to the babies.
[2970.38 --> 2971.26]  So those are
[2971.26 --> 2972.08]  the accusations
[2972.08 --> 2972.96]  the psalmist brings
[2972.96 --> 2973.82]  before God.
[2975.20 --> 2976.12]  And then he,
[2976.24 --> 2977.02]  next,
[2977.20 --> 2978.90]  proposes a sentence.
[2979.36 --> 2980.04]  He proposes
[2980.04 --> 2981.24]  a just punishment.
[2981.24 --> 2983.86]  What should justice
[2983.86 --> 2984.64]  look like
[2984.64 --> 2985.60]  in this situation?
[2986.54 --> 2987.24]  What punishment
[2987.24 --> 2987.92]  should they get?
[2988.90 --> 2989.58]  And he says,
[2989.68 --> 2990.22]  it should be done
[2990.22 --> 2990.72]  to them
[2990.72 --> 2991.70]  exactly,
[2991.90 --> 2992.90]  no more or less,
[2993.26 --> 2994.22]  what they did to us.
[2995.28 --> 2996.08]  It's an appeal
[2996.08 --> 2996.98]  to simple justice.
[2998.64 --> 2999.66]  How could God
[2999.66 --> 3000.38]  repay Babylon
[3000.38 --> 3001.40]  according to what
[3001.40 --> 3002.24]  they had done
[3002.24 --> 3002.98]  to Israel?
[3003.92 --> 3004.68]  Look at verse 9.
[3005.88 --> 3006.80]  Happy is the one
[3006.80 --> 3007.80]  who seizes
[3007.80 --> 3008.62]  your infants
[3008.62 --> 3009.90]  and dashes them
[3009.90 --> 3010.78]  against the rocks.
[3011.98 --> 3013.20]  So what is the psalmist
[3013.20 --> 3013.76]  doing here?
[3014.70 --> 3016.52]  He's taking his anger,
[3017.18 --> 3019.36]  his just cause,
[3019.86 --> 3020.94]  into the presence
[3020.94 --> 3021.82]  of God through prayer.
[3021.82 --> 3024.58]  And he's reminding
[3024.58 --> 3026.20]  himself that God
[3026.20 --> 3027.92]  is the judge.
[3029.00 --> 3030.28]  And he's calling
[3030.28 --> 3030.96]  on God
[3030.96 --> 3032.34]  to act.
[3032.80 --> 3033.28]  Remember,
[3033.96 --> 3036.10]  come to our aid,
[3036.54 --> 3037.62]  do what is right.
[3038.72 --> 3039.30]  And notice
[3039.30 --> 3040.32]  what he doesn't say.
[3040.40 --> 3041.24]  He doesn't say,
[3041.44 --> 3042.38]  as many people
[3042.38 --> 3043.28]  in the ancient world
[3043.28 --> 3045.12]  and many of us today,
[3045.54 --> 3046.82]  what they would say is,
[3047.16 --> 3049.06]  I'm going to take revenge
[3049.06 --> 3051.00]  for what they have done.
[3051.80 --> 3053.12]  I'm going to get them back.
[3053.58 --> 3053.84]  God,
[3054.00 --> 3054.88]  help me
[3054.88 --> 3056.52]  to get them back.
[3057.24 --> 3058.26]  He doesn't say that.
[3058.68 --> 3059.14]  He says,
[3059.22 --> 3059.72]  remember,
[3059.98 --> 3060.22]  Lord,
[3060.28 --> 3061.28]  what they have done.
[3061.64 --> 3062.48]  Remember the suffering
[3062.48 --> 3063.16]  of your people.
[3063.52 --> 3064.42]  You're the judge.
[3065.02 --> 3066.16]  And he rests
[3066.16 --> 3067.48]  in God's judgment
[3067.48 --> 3068.64]  and in God's righteousness.
[3071.80 --> 3073.32]  So that's what's going on here.
[3074.36 --> 3074.80]  Now,
[3074.90 --> 3076.48]  how are we to apply this
[3076.48 --> 3077.44]  to our lives today?
[3077.44 --> 3079.44]  And the question is,
[3079.68 --> 3081.10]  should we pray
[3081.10 --> 3082.62]  these verses
[3082.62 --> 3083.64]  of Psalm 137?
[3084.88 --> 3085.98]  Should we ask God
[3085.98 --> 3087.58]  to repay our enemies
[3087.58 --> 3088.98]  according to what
[3088.98 --> 3090.10]  they have done
[3090.10 --> 3091.28]  to us?
[3093.06 --> 3093.62]  Well,
[3093.80 --> 3094.04]  first,
[3094.14 --> 3094.72]  let's say this.
[3094.92 --> 3095.90]  There's nothing wrong
[3095.90 --> 3096.66]  with what the psalmist
[3096.66 --> 3097.16]  says here.
[3098.08 --> 3099.48]  He's not taking vengeance
[3099.48 --> 3100.36]  into his own hands.
[3100.54 --> 3101.54]  He's asking God
[3101.54 --> 3102.36]  for justice.
[3102.46 --> 3103.10]  That is the right thing
[3103.10 --> 3103.44]  to do.
[3105.28 --> 3105.90]  And something
[3105.90 --> 3106.68]  that we can learn
[3106.68 --> 3107.36]  from this prayer
[3107.36 --> 3108.78]  is the importance
[3108.78 --> 3109.40]  of honesty.
[3110.28 --> 3110.36]  Right?
[3110.52 --> 3112.30]  We can talk
[3112.30 --> 3112.82]  to God
[3112.82 --> 3113.56]  directly
[3113.56 --> 3115.46]  about our anger
[3115.46 --> 3116.10]  at the evil
[3116.10 --> 3116.72]  of this world.
[3117.36 --> 3117.56]  Right?
[3117.58 --> 3118.24]  We can be honest
[3118.24 --> 3118.98]  with what's in
[3118.98 --> 3119.90]  our own hearts.
[3120.78 --> 3121.46]  We can,
[3121.56 --> 3121.92]  you know,
[3121.98 --> 3122.92]  we can just express
[3122.92 --> 3124.02]  our anger to God.
[3125.18 --> 3125.70]  But,
[3126.12 --> 3127.98]  at the same time,
[3128.32 --> 3128.94]  if anybody
[3128.94 --> 3129.74]  in this room,
[3129.86 --> 3130.46]  me or you,
[3130.90 --> 3131.58]  today,
[3132.46 --> 3133.32]  prayed this kind
[3133.32 --> 3133.74]  of prayer,
[3133.74 --> 3133.80]  prayer,
[3134.40 --> 3134.88]  that God
[3134.88 --> 3135.46]  would do harm
[3135.46 --> 3135.96]  to someone
[3135.96 --> 3136.50]  for what
[3136.50 --> 3137.42]  they had done
[3137.42 --> 3137.86]  to you,
[3138.20 --> 3138.82]  as horrendous
[3138.82 --> 3139.30]  as it may have
[3139.30 --> 3139.54]  been,
[3139.98 --> 3140.88]  it would be wrong.
[3141.66 --> 3142.38]  It would be wrong
[3142.38 --> 3142.94]  to pray this.
[3144.62 --> 3145.00]  Why?
[3145.16 --> 3145.98]  Is it a double standard?
[3146.66 --> 3146.94]  No,
[3147.00 --> 3147.72]  because we live
[3147.72 --> 3148.38]  on the other side
[3148.38 --> 3148.92]  of the cross.
[3149.66 --> 3150.54]  We live on the other
[3150.54 --> 3151.62]  side of the cross
[3151.62 --> 3152.82]  of Jesus Christ.
[3154.12 --> 3154.94]  Let me explain.
[3154.94 --> 3156.86]  Earlier,
[3157.14 --> 3158.24]  in our service,
[3158.38 --> 3159.86]  we read from Luke 19,
[3160.26 --> 3160.40]  right,
[3160.46 --> 3161.34]  about the triumphal
[3161.34 --> 3162.32]  entry into Jerusalem.
[3163.34 --> 3164.02]  And as Jesus
[3164.02 --> 3165.22]  was drawing near
[3165.22 --> 3165.96]  as king
[3165.96 --> 3166.98]  to come into
[3166.98 --> 3167.94]  the city of Jerusalem,
[3168.04 --> 3168.62]  this is what Luke
[3168.62 --> 3169.24]  tells us.
[3170.42 --> 3170.88]  So,
[3170.94 --> 3171.42]  listen to this
[3171.42 --> 3171.86]  if you can.
[3172.88 --> 3173.62]  As Jesus
[3173.62 --> 3174.48]  approached Jerusalem
[3174.48 --> 3175.42]  and he saw the city,
[3175.84 --> 3176.72]  he wept over it.
[3177.46 --> 3178.28]  And he said,
[3179.24 --> 3179.74]  if you,
[3180.06 --> 3180.62]  even you,
[3180.72 --> 3181.92]  had only known
[3181.92 --> 3182.62]  on this day
[3182.62 --> 3183.54]  what would bring
[3183.54 --> 3184.18]  you peace,
[3184.78 --> 3184.92]  right,
[3184.94 --> 3185.42]  the salvation
[3185.42 --> 3185.80]  that Jesus
[3185.80 --> 3186.40]  came to bring,
[3187.08 --> 3188.18]  but now it is
[3188.18 --> 3189.24]  hidden from your eyes.
[3190.68 --> 3191.42]  The day will come
[3191.42 --> 3191.96]  upon you
[3191.96 --> 3192.74]  when your enemies
[3192.74 --> 3193.30]  will build an
[3193.30 --> 3194.30]  embarkment against you
[3194.30 --> 3195.18]  and encircle you
[3195.18 --> 3196.08]  and hem you in
[3196.08 --> 3196.78]  on every side.
[3197.66 --> 3198.60]  They will dash you
[3198.60 --> 3199.16]  to the ground,
[3199.30 --> 3200.14]  you and the children
[3200.14 --> 3200.94]  within your walls.
[3201.52 --> 3202.34]  They will not leave
[3202.34 --> 3203.52]  one stone on another
[3203.52 --> 3204.86]  because you did not
[3204.86 --> 3205.90]  recognize the time
[3205.90 --> 3206.88]  of God's coming
[3206.88 --> 3207.94]  to you.
[3210.20 --> 3210.68]  Now,
[3210.78 --> 3211.22]  Jesus,
[3211.34 --> 3211.52]  right,
[3211.60 --> 3212.90]  saturated with scripture.
[3213.40 --> 3214.36]  He knew the scriptures.
[3214.36 --> 3215.78]  So he comes
[3215.78 --> 3216.42]  into Jerusalem
[3216.42 --> 3216.98]  and what does he
[3216.98 --> 3217.42]  think of?
[3218.28 --> 3218.78]  He thinks of
[3218.78 --> 3219.58]  Psalm 137.
[3220.52 --> 3221.32]  We know that
[3221.32 --> 3222.28]  because the only
[3222.28 --> 3223.10]  other place
[3223.10 --> 3224.28]  in the New Testament
[3224.28 --> 3225.26]  that uses that word
[3225.26 --> 3226.46]  dashed is here.
[3226.80 --> 3227.54]  That's the only place.
[3229.18 --> 3229.70]  And notice
[3229.70 --> 3230.94]  how he refers
[3230.94 --> 3232.10]  to these
[3232.10 --> 3232.90]  accusations
[3232.90 --> 3234.30]  both of the,
[3234.48 --> 3235.42]  against the Edomites
[3235.42 --> 3236.64]  and against the Babylonians.
[3236.64 --> 3238.18]  and Jesus says
[3238.18 --> 3238.36]  there,
[3238.52 --> 3238.90]  they will
[3238.90 --> 3239.64]  dash you
[3239.64 --> 3240.42]  to the ground
[3240.42 --> 3241.34]  and the children.
[3242.20 --> 3243.16]  They will not leave
[3243.16 --> 3244.32]  one stone on another.
[3244.90 --> 3245.04]  Right?
[3245.30 --> 3246.24]  Both of those things
[3246.24 --> 3246.78]  come directly
[3246.78 --> 3248.00]  from Psalm 137.
[3248.48 --> 3249.30]  What is Jesus
[3249.30 --> 3250.00]  talking about?
[3251.70 --> 3253.48]  He is foretelling
[3253.48 --> 3254.26]  something
[3254.26 --> 3255.46]  that will happen.
[3257.20 --> 3258.10]  Something that did
[3258.10 --> 3258.62]  come true
[3258.62 --> 3259.56]  which was
[3259.56 --> 3260.18]  the destruction
[3260.18 --> 3260.90]  of Jerusalem
[3260.90 --> 3261.52]  yet again
[3261.52 --> 3263.58]  by the Roman armies,
[3263.68 --> 3264.72]  by the General Titus
[3264.72 --> 3266.20]  in the year 70 AD.
[3267.16 --> 3268.14]  This all happened.
[3269.36 --> 3270.02]  And notice
[3270.02 --> 3270.82]  that just like
[3270.82 --> 3271.42]  the psalmist
[3271.42 --> 3272.42]  in Psalm 137
[3272.42 --> 3273.62]  Jesus is weeping
[3273.62 --> 3276.62]  and he saw the city
[3276.62 --> 3277.74]  and he wept over it
[3277.74 --> 3279.04]  but who is he
[3279.04 --> 3279.70]  weeping for?
[3281.54 --> 3282.46]  Jesus is not
[3282.46 --> 3283.28]  weeping for himself.
[3284.34 --> 3285.10]  He's weeping
[3285.10 --> 3285.76]  for his enemies.
[3286.92 --> 3287.02]  Right?
[3287.06 --> 3287.70]  He's weeping
[3287.70 --> 3288.78]  for those
[3288.78 --> 3289.78]  who are about
[3289.78 --> 3290.72]  to reject him
[3290.72 --> 3291.62]  and who are about
[3291.62 --> 3292.26]  to kill him.
[3292.78 --> 3292.98]  Right?
[3293.02 --> 3293.56]  He knows
[3293.56 --> 3294.26]  that he is about
[3294.26 --> 3295.08]  to be put to death.
[3295.76 --> 3296.18]  He knows
[3296.18 --> 3296.86]  that they are going
[3296.86 --> 3297.62]  to reject him.
[3298.66 --> 3298.90]  And yet
[3298.90 --> 3299.50]  he doesn't say
[3299.50 --> 3299.86]  to them
[3299.86 --> 3301.02]  in this
[3301.02 --> 3302.58]  lament
[3302.58 --> 3303.28]  he doesn't say
[3303.28 --> 3304.38]  God do to them
[3304.38 --> 3305.18]  as they are going
[3305.18 --> 3305.88]  to do to me.
[3305.96 --> 3306.44]  He doesn't pray
[3306.44 --> 3307.00]  to God
[3307.00 --> 3308.56]  to repay them
[3308.56 --> 3309.36]  for the harm
[3309.36 --> 3309.78]  that they will
[3309.78 --> 3310.36]  cause him.
[3311.50 --> 3311.90]  Right?
[3311.96 --> 3312.46]  And even as
[3312.46 --> 3312.84]  he's hanging
[3312.84 --> 3313.60]  on the cross
[3313.60 --> 3314.48]  he looks
[3314.48 --> 3315.08]  to those
[3315.08 --> 3316.00]  who are crucifying
[3316.00 --> 3316.38]  him
[3316.38 --> 3317.70]  and he says
[3317.70 --> 3318.42]  Father
[3318.42 --> 3320.18]  forgive them.
[3320.18 --> 3323.54]  you know
[3323.54 --> 3324.30]  the psalmist
[3324.30 --> 3325.38]  rightly says
[3325.38 --> 3326.64]  what about
[3326.64 --> 3327.56]  our babies?
[3329.06 --> 3329.64]  Shouldn't
[3329.64 --> 3330.24]  justice
[3330.24 --> 3331.32]  be done
[3331.32 --> 3332.18]  for our
[3332.18 --> 3332.96]  little ones?
[3333.42 --> 3333.84]  Shouldn't
[3333.84 --> 3334.38]  someone pay
[3334.38 --> 3334.78]  for that?
[3335.98 --> 3336.44]  And what is
[3336.44 --> 3337.12]  Jesus' answer?
[3337.20 --> 3337.80]  What is the answer
[3337.80 --> 3338.26]  of the Bible?
[3339.46 --> 3339.88]  God says
[3339.88 --> 3340.30]  yes
[3340.30 --> 3341.58]  of course
[3341.58 --> 3342.48]  that has
[3342.48 --> 3342.96]  to be paid
[3342.96 --> 3343.26]  for
[3343.26 --> 3344.88]  and I
[3344.88 --> 3345.64]  will pay it.
[3345.64 --> 3347.70]  you know
[3347.70 --> 3348.90]  my little one
[3348.90 --> 3349.58]  God says
[3349.58 --> 3350.50]  the son
[3350.50 --> 3351.38]  of my heart
[3351.38 --> 3352.66]  in an act
[3352.66 --> 3353.26]  of evil
[3353.26 --> 3354.14]  and horrible
[3354.14 --> 3354.68]  injustice
[3354.68 --> 3356.76]  was dashed
[3356.76 --> 3357.40]  to the ground.
[3359.40 --> 3360.28]  Jesus received
[3360.28 --> 3360.86]  the punishment
[3360.86 --> 3361.74]  that all of us
[3361.74 --> 3362.14]  deserve
[3362.14 --> 3362.78]  because of
[3362.78 --> 3363.32]  our sin
[3363.32 --> 3364.38]  and our evil
[3364.38 --> 3366.10]  and he did it
[3366.10 --> 3366.72]  voluntarily
[3366.72 --> 3367.38]  he did it
[3367.38 --> 3367.92]  out of love
[3367.92 --> 3369.10]  for his enemies
[3369.10 --> 3370.14]  for us.
[3371.42 --> 3371.52]  Right?
[3371.58 --> 3372.00]  Because you know
[3372.00 --> 3372.82]  the psalmist is right
[3372.82 --> 3374.10]  justice has to be done
[3374.10 --> 3375.26]  and it was.
[3376.28 --> 3377.20]  The punishment
[3377.20 --> 3379.18]  that we deserved
[3379.18 --> 3379.96]  was carried out
[3379.96 --> 3380.52]  on Jesus
[3380.52 --> 3381.88]  in our place
[3381.88 --> 3383.34]  to save us.
[3383.96 --> 3384.08]  Right?
[3384.12 --> 3384.98]  To restore you
[3384.98 --> 3385.72]  to his presence
[3385.72 --> 3387.20]  so that he could
[3387.20 --> 3388.26]  be your greatest joy
[3388.26 --> 3390.22]  because he loves
[3390.22 --> 3390.66]  his enemies.
[3392.76 --> 3393.00]  And so
[3393.00 --> 3394.02]  how should we then
[3394.02 --> 3394.80]  as pilgrims
[3394.80 --> 3395.72]  today pray
[3395.72 --> 3397.46]  on this side
[3397.46 --> 3398.00]  of the cross?
[3398.82 --> 3399.40]  Well I think
[3399.40 --> 3399.58]  you know
[3399.58 --> 3400.30]  with God's help
[3400.30 --> 3401.64]  we can seek
[3401.64 --> 3402.44]  to love our enemies
[3402.44 --> 3403.78]  as Jesus did.
[3404.50 --> 3405.36]  We can forgive
[3405.36 --> 3405.76]  them
[3405.76 --> 3407.06]  because forgiveness
[3407.06 --> 3407.66]  is available
[3407.66 --> 3408.58]  through the cross.
[3409.28 --> 3410.18]  We can pray
[3410.18 --> 3410.84]  for salvation
[3410.84 --> 3412.02]  to come to our enemies
[3412.02 --> 3413.42]  just as it's come
[3413.42 --> 3413.90]  to us
[3413.90 --> 3414.38]  when we didn't
[3414.38 --> 3414.92]  deserve it.
[3416.02 --> 3417.18]  That does not mean
[3417.18 --> 3417.98]  that we should allow
[3417.98 --> 3418.90]  injustice and evil
[3418.90 --> 3419.76]  to go unnoticed.
[3420.18 --> 3421.24]  We should seek
[3421.24 --> 3422.36]  justice and restoration
[3422.36 --> 3422.90]  now.
[3424.40 --> 3425.28]  We should listen
[3425.28 --> 3426.14]  to the cries
[3426.14 --> 3428.68]  of the victims
[3428.68 --> 3429.88]  of this world
[3429.88 --> 3431.56]  and yet we also
[3431.56 --> 3433.38]  rest in the promise
[3433.38 --> 3433.88]  that Jesus
[3433.88 --> 3434.80]  will return
[3434.80 --> 3436.18]  and he will judge
[3436.18 --> 3437.00]  the living and the dead
[3437.00 --> 3438.54]  and he will make
[3438.54 --> 3439.14]  all things right.
[3440.46 --> 3441.24]  So let's pray.
[3444.74 --> 3445.46]  Lord would you
[3445.46 --> 3446.16]  teach us
[3446.16 --> 3448.56]  to weep
[3448.56 --> 3450.22]  as you wept.
[3451.44 --> 3452.16]  Teach us Lord
[3452.16 --> 3452.82]  to remember
[3452.82 --> 3454.50]  God's presence
[3454.50 --> 3455.78]  in our lives
[3455.78 --> 3456.68]  as we live
[3456.68 --> 3458.28]  in exile
[3458.28 --> 3460.20]  and as we await
[3460.20 --> 3460.90]  for your kingdom.
[3461.86 --> 3462.88]  Lord would we set you
[3462.88 --> 3463.88]  as our highest joy.
[3464.60 --> 3465.30]  Teach us to bring
[3465.30 --> 3466.00]  our anger
[3466.00 --> 3467.14]  and our hatred
[3467.14 --> 3468.04]  and our desires
[3468.04 --> 3468.64]  for vengeance
[3468.64 --> 3469.48]  and to lay them
[3469.48 --> 3469.98]  at your feet.
[3470.98 --> 3471.80]  You have promised
[3471.80 --> 3472.84]  to take care of evil
[3472.84 --> 3474.08]  and we ask
[3474.08 --> 3474.84]  that you would do it.
[3475.70 --> 3476.34]  Lord we rest
[3476.34 --> 3477.08]  in your promises
[3477.08 --> 3478.14]  in the name
[3478.14 --> 3478.90]  of Jesus Christ
[3478.90 --> 3479.38]  our Lord.
[3479.86 --> 3480.88]  We pray in his name.
[3481.42 --> 3481.66]  Amen.
[3483.92 --> 3484.40]  Alright.
[3484.60 --> 3485.40]  So let's all
[3485.40 --> 3486.26]  stand
[3486.26 --> 3487.72]  get moving
[3487.72 --> 3489.72]  as the worship team
[3489.72 --> 3490.12]  comes up.

[3521.54 --> 3523.90]  of the risen
[3523.90 --> 3524.46]  king
[3524.46 --> 3526.06]  who delight
[3526.06 --> 3527.46]  to bring him
[3527.46 --> 3529.02]  praise
[3529.02 --> 3530.80]  come all
[3530.80 --> 3532.14]  unto your

[3541.62 --> 3543.34]  of the earth
[3543.34 --> 3545.06]  we will lift
[3545.06 --> 3545.90]  our eyes
[3545.90 --> 3547.84]  to him
[3547.84 --> 3549.86]  where steady
[3549.86 --> 3552.20]  arms of mercy
[3552.20 --> 3554.48]  reach together
[3554.48 --> 3557.08]  children in.

[3886.10 --> 3905.18]  One kind of happy announcement related to our church family is that Jeff and Ashley have come back from Thailand, where they were there for a month or so, and they have brought back with them Maya, who is a girl of about three years old, and they have adopted her into their family.
[3905.48 --> 3913.46]  And so we give thanks to God with them for that, and I think they're home adjusting, and maybe they'll join us when they're ready.
[3913.70 --> 3917.04]  But let's come before the Lord in prayer together.
[3920.94 --> 3939.40]  Heavenly Father, in Paul's epistle to Timothy, Lord, you urge us to make petitions and prayers, intercession and thanksgiving for all people, for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
[3939.40 --> 3946.82]  This is good and pleases God, our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[3946.82 --> 3951.82]  And so, Lord, we take up that prayer, and we lift it up to you this morning.
[3952.78 --> 3959.18]  Lord, we thank you for the freedom that we have here in Canada to worship you, the one true and living God.
[3959.78 --> 3965.06]  We thank you that at this time and place that we can live peaceful and quiet lives.
[3965.06 --> 3975.74]  We thank you that we can follow you, and we can live out what you reveal to us in your word without persecution, even if it's not popular.
[3976.82 --> 3979.90]  And Lord, even maybe if it's despised by the world around us.
[3981.50 --> 3989.26]  And Lord, we seek that life for the world as well, that life of peace.
[3989.26 --> 3993.74]  Lord, we pray, Lord, for the end of violence and injustice in our world.
[3994.48 --> 4004.56]  Lord, when we see the news that fills up our screens and our newspapers every day of wars raging in so many places in this world,
[4005.18 --> 4006.84]  Lord, we cry to you.
[4007.00 --> 4011.46]  We say, please, supreme maker of peace, would you bring peace to our world?
[4012.46 --> 4016.84]  Lord, we pray for our governing authorities here in this nation of Canada.
[4016.84 --> 4021.52]  Help them as they govern all, all who live in this land.
[4022.62 --> 4028.06]  Lord, would you fill our governing authorities with the love of truth and righteousness that comes from you,
[4028.84 --> 4031.72]  that they might serve the Lord in fear.
[4033.50 --> 4037.64]  Lord, even as we consider the fragility of our earthly kingdoms,
[4038.70 --> 4044.92]  Lord, we find comfort in the permanence in the promise of your heavenly kingdom.
[4044.92 --> 4050.58]  Lord, would you help us to remember that our citizenship is in heaven,
[4051.06 --> 4056.68]  that we are but sojourners and aliens here on this earth.
[4057.84 --> 4060.88]  And Lord, help us to find our greatest joy in you.
[4061.04 --> 4066.72]  We pray, Lord, for your church, that it would shine as a light in this dark place,
[4066.72 --> 4070.44]  even as it remembers who it is and sometimes even has to resist.
[4071.90 --> 4074.94]  Father, we pray for the lost.
[4075.04 --> 4080.04]  You say that you desire all people to come to a knowledge, a saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus.
[4080.86 --> 4083.74]  So, Lord, we pray for those who do not know the truth of the gospel,
[4084.58 --> 4087.62]  numbering many billions as far as we can tell in the world today.
[4087.62 --> 4093.76]  And we ask that you would send people, send us, send missionaries, send your church,
[4094.40 --> 4095.98]  Lord, for the work of your harvest,
[4096.56 --> 4101.24]  that many around the world would come to know the peace of salvation through Christ,
[4102.24 --> 4105.64]  and that they would turn from darkness to your light,
[4106.42 --> 4110.34]  being filled with faith, hope, and the life that only comes from you.
[4110.34 --> 4116.88]  Lord, we pray for all the students in our midst who are heading back to school next week.
[4117.74 --> 4120.24]  Lord, go with them and be with these students.
[4121.00 --> 4124.94]  Bless them as they grow in knowledge of the world that you have made.
[4125.20 --> 4129.50]  And Lord, be with the teachers and assistants and administrators
[4129.50 --> 4132.14]  and all those, Lord, who seek to serve our kids.
[4133.44 --> 4136.96]  Lord, again, we pray for our congregation.
[4136.96 --> 4139.12]  We especially rejoice with Jeff and Ashley,
[4139.90 --> 4143.80]  who came home with little Maya and who was adopted into their family.
[4144.36 --> 4145.62]  Lord, bless them as a family.
[4145.84 --> 4148.06]  Help Maya to adjust well to a new home
[4148.06 --> 4151.90]  in what must be a very kind of traumatic experience for her.
[4152.84 --> 4159.26]  But, Lord, would she come to see her home with Jeff and Ashley as her home.
[4159.96 --> 4163.78]  Lord, would you give Jeff and Ashley wisdom, guidance, love, and patience
[4163.78 --> 4164.98]  that they will need as well.
[4164.98 --> 4170.38]  Lord, we pray for those in our midst who are suffering in various ways.
[4171.02 --> 4174.94]  Lord, for all of our needs that are seen and unseen, heard and unheard.
[4175.42 --> 4176.54]  Lord, we lift them up to you.
[4177.18 --> 4179.36]  We ask all these things in the name of your Son,
[4179.78 --> 4182.16]  who taught us to pray, saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4182.92 --> 4184.64]  Our Father, who art in heaven,
[4185.36 --> 4186.58]  hallowed be thy name.
[4187.22 --> 4189.88]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
[4190.26 --> 4192.04]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[4192.04 --> 4195.00]  Give us this day our daily bread,
[4195.62 --> 4197.44]  and forgive us our trespasses,
[4197.62 --> 4200.76]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4201.44 --> 4203.28]  And lead us not into temptation,
[4203.90 --> 4205.36]  but deliver us from evil.
[4205.90 --> 4207.22]  For thine is the kingdom,
[4207.62 --> 4208.34]  and the power,
[4208.90 --> 4210.86]  and the glory forever and ever.
[4211.70 --> 4212.00]  Amen.
[4212.00 --> 4214.44]  Let's all stand.
[4217.00 --> 4220.50]  And as we conclude our time of worship together,
[4220.72 --> 4222.12]  let us raise our hands
[4222.12 --> 4223.20]  to receive
[4223.20 --> 4226.68]  the wonderful benediction of the Lord upon us.
[4227.50 --> 4229.70]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[4229.82 --> 4231.14]  and the love of God the Father,
[4231.54 --> 4232.98]  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[4233.20 --> 4234.44]  be with each of you,
[4234.98 --> 4236.26]  now and forever.
[4236.80 --> 4237.18]  Amen.
[4237.90 --> 4240.96]  Let's remain standing for our final song as we leave.
[4240.96 --> 4243.30] .
[4243.30 --> 4272.30]  Praise the Lord, from who all blessings flowed,
[4272.30 --> 4282.30]  He has lost and made me white as snow.
[4282.30 --> 4292.30]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame,
[4292.30 --> 4302.30]  Now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[4302.30 --> 4312.30]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[4312.30 --> 4322.30]  To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[4322.30 --> 4334.30]  God is great and ready to be praised
[4334.30 --> 4344.30]  Above all the lands that His name be raised.
[4344.30 --> 4354.30]  Saints and angels evermore proclaim,
[4354.30 --> 4366.30]  Now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[4366.30 --> 4374.30]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[4374.30 --> 4384.30]  To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[4384.30 --> 4398.30]  To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[4398.30 --> 4406.30]  Praise His holy name.
