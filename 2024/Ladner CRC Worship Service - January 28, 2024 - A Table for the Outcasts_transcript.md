[495.98 --> 497.98]  Thank you.
[497.98 --> 499.98]  Thank you.
[499.98 --> 501.98]  Thank you.
[501.98 --> 503.98]  Thank you.

[517.98 --> 519.98]  Thank you.
[519.98 --> 521.98]  Thank you.
[541.98 --> 556.82]  If you are spiritually weary and in search of rest,
[557.60 --> 560.82]  if you are mourning and you long for comfort,
[561.46 --> 564.54]  if you are struggling and desire victory,
[565.54 --> 569.94]  if you realize that you are a sinner and need a savior,
[569.94 --> 573.40]  God welcomes you here in the name of Christ.
[574.60 --> 576.76]  To the stranger in need of fellowship,
[577.58 --> 580.50]  to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[581.44 --> 583.18]  and to whoever will come,
[584.08 --> 589.04]  we open wide our doors and welcome all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[590.32 --> 594.10]  My name is Marian, and I will lead our worship together with the worship team
[594.10 --> 596.84]  as we focus on the reason for being here,
[596.84 --> 602.12]  to glorify the one, only, true God, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[603.24 --> 606.78]  Our invitation comes from Revelation 3, verse 20.
[608.04 --> 610.50]  Here I am, I stand at the door and knock.
[611.30 --> 614.10]  If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
[614.78 --> 619.08]  I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
[619.90 --> 623.28]  Please rise as we sing our prayer of adoration together.
[623.28 --> 648.28]  Father, Father, we are a moment,
[648.28 --> 658.28]  You are forever, Lord of the ages, God before time.
[659.34 --> 673.28]  We are a vapor, you are eternal, love everlasting, reigning on high.
[673.28 --> 686.28]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[687.64 --> 699.28]  Highest praises, honor and glory be unto your name.
[699.28 --> 706.52]  Be unto your name.
[707.62 --> 713.28]  We are the broken, you are the healer.
[714.42 --> 719.28]  Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save.
[719.28 --> 726.28]  You are the love song, we'll sing forever.
[727.90 --> 734.28]  Bowing before you, blessing your name.
[734.28 --> 748.28]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[748.28 --> 761.28]  Highest praises, honor and glory be unto your name.
[761.28 --> 768.28]  Be unto your name.
[768.28 --> 782.44]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[782.44 --> 794.44]  Highest praises, honor and glory be unto your name.
[794.44 --> 801.44]  Be unto your name.
[801.44 --> 818.62]  I'm getting my exercise this morning.
[818.68 --> 825.34]  We had a few technical issues with the guitar, so we had to kind of not use it this morning.
[825.42 --> 826.18]  So I'm back and forth.
[826.18 --> 841.04]  Our God greets us this morning with the words, grace, mercy, and peace be ours in abundance through Christ our Lord.
[841.04 --> 844.08]  And as he greets us, let's also greet one another.
[844.08 --> 845.08]  Amen.
[845.08 --> 846.08]  Amen.
[846.08 --> 848.08]  Amen.
[848.08 --> 850.08]  Amen.
[850.08 --> 852.08]  Amen.
[852.08 --> 854.08]  Amen.
[854.08 --> 856.08]  Amen.
[856.08 --> 860.98]  Amen.
[860.98 --> 862.98]  Amen.
[862.98 --> 863.98]  Amen.
[863.98 --> 866.30]  Amen.
[866.42 --> 868.44]  Amen.
[868.44 --> 870.04]  Amen.
[870.04 --> 872.16]  Amen.
[872.16 --> 873.36]  Amen.
[873.36 --> 874.32]  Now, right now.
[874.74 --> 876.04]  Amen.
[876.04 --> 877.58]  Amen.
[877.60 --> 878.22]  Amen.
[878.22 --> 882.22]  Amen.
[882.22 --> 882.80]  Amen.
[883.22 --> 883.64]  Amen.
[883.64 --> 884.72]  Amen.
[884.72 --> 885.72]  Amen.
[885.72 --> 915.70]  Thank you.
[915.72 --> 920.18]  Who has held the oceans in his hands?
[920.56 --> 925.52]  Who has numbered every great unsan?
[925.98 --> 931.12]  Kings and nations tremble at his voice.
[931.60 --> 936.92]  All creation passes to rejoice.
[936.92 --> 944.92]  He holds our God sitting on his throne.
[944.92 --> 948.62]  Come let us adore him.
[949.04 --> 952.98]  Behold our King.
[953.38 --> 955.16]  Nothing can compare.
[956.16 --> 960.92]  Come let us adore him.
[960.92 --> 976.38]  Who has given counsel to the Lord?
[976.38 --> 981.70]  Who can question any of his words?
[982.20 --> 987.30]  Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[987.68 --> 992.38]  Who can fill up all his wondrous deeds?
[992.38 --> 994.34]  Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[994.34 --> 1000.72]  Lord our God seated on his throne.
[1001.08 --> 1004.50]  Come let us adore him.
[1004.50 --> 1011.64]  Behold our King, nothing can compare
[1011.64 --> 1017.44]  Come let us adore Him
[1017.44 --> 1032.18]  Who has felt the nails upon His hands
[1032.18 --> 1037.58]  Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
[1037.58 --> 1043.16]  God eternal, humbled to the grave
[1043.16 --> 1049.04]  Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign
[1049.04 --> 1056.88]  Behold our God seated on His throne
[1056.88 --> 1060.58]  Come let us adore Him
[1060.58 --> 1066.98]  Behold our King, nothing can compare
[1066.98 --> 1073.48]  Come let us adore Him
[1073.48 --> 1103.48] 
[1103.48 --> 1133.48] 
[1133.48 --> 1136.38]  The King, don't show not pass away
[1136.38 --> 1139.88]  O Ancient of Days
[1139.88 --> 1148.58]  Let's sing and honor, glory and power
[1148.58 --> 1152.78]  Be unto the Ancient of Days
[1152.78 --> 1158.28]  From every nation, all of creation
[1158.28 --> 1163.18]  Bow before the Ancient of Days
[1163.18 --> 1167.68]  Every tongue in heaven and earth
[1167.68 --> 1169.78]  Shall declare your glory
[1169.78 --> 1173.18]  Every knee shall bow at your throne
[1173.18 --> 1177.68]  In worship you will be exalted, O God
[1177.68 --> 1183.08]  And your kingdom shall not pass away
[1183.08 --> 1186.08]  O Ancient of Days
[1186.08 --> 1195.48]  A kingdom shall reign over all the earth
[1195.48 --> 1198.98]  Sing unto the Ancient of Days
[1198.98 --> 1205.38]  For none can compare to your matchless world
[1205.38 --> 1209.88]  Sing unto the Ancient of Days
[1209.88 --> 1212.28]  Every tongue in heaven and earth
[1212.28 --> 1214.28]  Every tongue in heaven and earth
[1214.28 --> 1215.28]  Every tongue in heaven and earth
[1215.28 --> 1216.28]  shall declare your glory
[1216.28 --> 1219.28]  Every knee shall bow at your throne
[1219.28 --> 1224.78]  In worship you will be exalted, O God
[1224.78 --> 1229.28]  And your kingdom shall not pass away
[1229.28 --> 1232.68]  O Ancient of Days
[1232.68 --> 1243.38]  Please be seated
[1243.38 --> 1248.58]  I'm actually going to read from a scripture
[1248.58 --> 1250.22]  So if you could take out your Bibles
[1250.22 --> 1253.22]  We're going to be reading from Isaiah 25
[1253.22 --> 1256.30]  Number 527
[1256.30 --> 1259.40]  Come on, take out your Bibles
[1259.40 --> 1261.86]  It's not going to be up there
[1261.86 --> 1264.00]  Okay
[1264.00 --> 1266.70]  O Lord, you are my God
[1266.70 --> 1269.70]  I will exalt you and praise your name
[1269.70 --> 1272.18]  For in perfect faithfulness
[1272.18 --> 1274.78]  You have done marvelous things
[1274.78 --> 1277.44]  Things planned long ago
[1277.44 --> 1280.94]  You have made the city a heap of rubble
[1280.94 --> 1283.60]  The fortified town a ruin
[1283.60 --> 1286.08]  The foreigners' stronghold
[1286.08 --> 1287.38]  A city no more
[1287.38 --> 1289.74]  It will never be rebuilt
[1289.74 --> 1293.94]  Therefore, strong peoples will honor you
[1293.94 --> 1297.52]  Cities of ruthless nations will revere you
[1297.52 --> 1300.28]  You have been a refuge for the poor
[1300.28 --> 1303.44]  A refuge for the needy in his distress
[1303.44 --> 1305.58]  A shelter from the storm
[1305.58 --> 1307.66]  And a shade from the heat
[1307.66 --> 1309.90]  For the breath of the ruthless
[1309.90 --> 1312.92]  Is like a storm driving against a wall
[1312.92 --> 1314.86]  And like the heat of the desert
[1314.86 --> 1316.58]  Your silence
[1316.58 --> 1317.08]  Or sorry
[1317.08 --> 1319.28]  You silence the uproar of foreigners
[1319.28 --> 1320.98]  As heat is reduced
[1320.98 --> 1322.46]  By the shadow of a cloud
[1322.46 --> 1324.68]  So the song of the ruthless
[1324.68 --> 1325.46]  Is stilled
[1325.46 --> 1327.30]  On this mountain
[1327.30 --> 1328.30]  The Lord Almighty
[1328.30 --> 1329.00]  Will prepare
[1329.00 --> 1330.92]  A feast of rich food
[1330.92 --> 1331.86]  For all peoples
[1331.86 --> 1333.78]  A banquet of aged wine
[1333.78 --> 1335.66]  The best of meats
[1335.66 --> 1336.98]  And the finest of wines
[1336.98 --> 1338.64]  On this mountain
[1338.64 --> 1339.72]  He will destroy
[1339.72 --> 1341.96]  The shroud that unfolds all people
[1341.96 --> 1344.28]  The sheet that covers all nations
[1344.28 --> 1346.84]  He will swallow up death forever
[1346.84 --> 1348.72]  The sovereign Lord
[1348.72 --> 1350.78]  Will wipe away the tears
[1350.78 --> 1351.84]  From all faces
[1351.84 --> 1354.44]  He will remove the disgrace
[1354.44 --> 1355.32]  From his people
[1355.32 --> 1356.60]  From all the earth
[1356.60 --> 1358.46]  The Lord has spoken
[1358.46 --> 1360.30]  In that day
[1360.30 --> 1361.12]  They will say
[1361.12 --> 1362.94]  Surely this is our God
[1362.94 --> 1364.48]  We trusted in him
[1364.48 --> 1365.66]  And he saved us
[1365.66 --> 1367.14]  This is the Lord
[1367.14 --> 1368.54]  We trusted in him
[1368.54 --> 1369.82]  Let us rejoice
[1369.82 --> 1370.70]  And be glad
[1370.70 --> 1371.68]  In his salvation
[1371.68 --> 1383.46]  Let's have our prayer of confession
[1383.46 --> 1385.72]  Pray with me please
[1385.72 --> 1389.24]  Jesus who spreads out a feast
[1389.24 --> 1390.82]  For outcasts and sinners
[1390.82 --> 1393.62]  We confess that too often
[1393.62 --> 1395.38]  Our own words and actions
[1395.38 --> 1396.60]  Are not consistent
[1396.60 --> 1397.68]  With our beliefs
[1397.68 --> 1400.64]  We often fail to invite you
[1400.64 --> 1401.78]  To eat with us
[1401.78 --> 1403.30]  You who provides
[1403.30 --> 1404.36]  The richest feast
[1404.36 --> 1407.08]  Often we ignore the needy
[1407.08 --> 1409.10]  Show indifference to the lonely
[1409.10 --> 1410.98]  And reject those
[1410.98 --> 1412.46]  Who seem different from us
[1412.46 --> 1414.66]  Forgive us we pray
[1414.66 --> 1417.08]  Empower us to reach out
[1417.08 --> 1418.16]  In love and acceptance
[1418.16 --> 1419.48]  Through your name
[1419.48 --> 1420.70]  Amen
[1420.70 --> 1424.12]  Our words of assurance
[1424.12 --> 1426.22]  Come from 1 Peter 2
[1426.22 --> 1427.50]  Verse 24
[1427.50 --> 1429.78]  He himself
[1429.78 --> 1431.38]  Bore our sins
[1431.38 --> 1432.34]  In his body
[1432.34 --> 1433.08]  On the cross
[1433.08 --> 1434.32]  So that
[1434.32 --> 1435.72]  Free from sins
[1435.72 --> 1436.82]  We might live
[1436.82 --> 1437.90]  For righteousness
[1437.90 --> 1439.90]  By his wounds
[1439.90 --> 1441.00]  We have been healed
[1441.00 --> 1443.62]  As you feel comfortable
[1443.62 --> 1444.78]  Please rise
[1444.78 --> 1446.34]  To sing our song of response
[1446.34 --> 1447.16]  For confession
[1447.16 --> 1464.58]  That
[1464.58 --> 1467.96]  Jesus, my Redeemer.
[1468.78 --> 1474.00]  There is no more for heaven now to give.
[1474.52 --> 1479.40]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[1480.32 --> 1485.74]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[1486.26 --> 1491.08]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1491.08 --> 1497.54]  For my life is fully bound to his.
[1498.12 --> 1502.58]  Oh, how strange and divine I can sing.
[1502.68 --> 1509.08]  All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1509.08 --> 1523.40]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[1524.26 --> 1528.92]  For on my side, the Savior, he will stay.
[1528.92 --> 1535.38]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing.
[1535.88 --> 1540.38]  For in my need, his power is displayed.
[1541.48 --> 1546.38]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[1546.38 --> 1552.76]  Through the deepest valley he will lead.
[1553.42 --> 1558.38]  Oh, the night has been won and I shall overcome.
[1559.28 --> 1563.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1563.38 --> 1577.80]  No pain I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[1578.80 --> 1583.84]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid.
[1583.84 --> 1589.46]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[1590.30 --> 1595.70]  And he was raised to overthrow the grave.
[1596.12 --> 1600.80]  To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[1602.16 --> 1606.50]  Jesus now and ever is my King.
[1606.50 --> 1610.58]  All the chains are released.
[1610.58 --> 1613.46]  I can sing, I am free.
[1613.72 --> 1618.58]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1618.58 --> 1635.14]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus.
[1636.06 --> 1641.40]  For he has said that he will bring me home.
[1641.40 --> 1647.06]  And day by day I know he will renew me.
[1647.06 --> 1652.38]  Until I stand, the joy before the throne.
[1653.08 --> 1657.84]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1659.04 --> 1664.02]  All the glory evermore to him.
[1664.60 --> 1670.06]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall we be.
[1670.34 --> 1674.54]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1674.54 --> 1694.54]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1696.56 --> 1698.36]  You may be seated.
[1698.36 --> 1707.80]  And the children are excused for a kid's life.
[1707.80 --> 1708.44]  IoT can't do it.
[1708.44 --> 1709.84]  The time is free.
[1709.84 --> 1711.14]  So let's grow.
[1711.14 --> 1711.42]  So let's hear you.
[1711.50 --> 1712.04]  Let's sing, I just do bye-bye.
[1712.58 --> 1713.12]  So let's encourage you to meet you.
[1713.12 --> 1735.92]  Good morning all.
[1736.98 --> 1738.82]  If I haven't met you, my name is Jason.
[1738.82 --> 1743.48]  And we will look at God's word together this morning.
[1743.66 --> 1747.08]  And so our text for this morning is Luke chapter 14.
[1747.74 --> 1749.76]  And we'll read verses 15 to 24.
[1749.96 --> 1753.86]  I encourage you to grab a Bible in the pew rack there in front of you.
[1753.94 --> 1755.88]  It's on page 777.
[1757.14 --> 1758.42]  Luke 14.
[1768.82 --> 1773.38]  Luke 14.
[1773.88 --> 1778.72]  Now by way of orientation, before we read actually, we are in the season of epiphany.
[1779.16 --> 1784.42]  And which I know is familiar to some of you, to others of you, maybe it is new and strange.
[1784.42 --> 1795.58]  And so if Advent is about anticipating the coming of Christ, and then if Christmas is about celebrating that Christ has come,
[1796.58 --> 1800.62]  epiphany is now where we look to Jesus.
[1800.86 --> 1803.22]  We look to his life and his ministry.
[1803.22 --> 1813.16]  And the way that we are looking at that together as a church this season is through a sermon series in the book of Luke called Come to the Table.
[1814.02 --> 1825.38]  And in this series, what we're seeing is that Jesus shows us what the kingdom of God is like through sharing meals with people at a table.
[1826.36 --> 1828.90]  And so that's what we have been looking at over the last few weeks.
[1828.90 --> 1833.40]  And today, we come to a table for the outcasts.
[1833.50 --> 1835.04]  A table for the outcasts.
[1835.32 --> 1837.60]  So just to set the scene that we're going to read here.
[1838.10 --> 1842.52]  So Jesus is eating at the house of the ruler of the Pharisees.
[1842.58 --> 1845.82]  So this is kind of like, you know, a big, high status guy.
[1846.56 --> 1847.62]  It's the Sabbath.
[1848.42 --> 1857.04]  And Jesus has just healed a man, which is a shock to the people who do not do such things on the Sabbath.
[1857.04 --> 1862.10]  And then he begins to teach about the life of the kingdom of God.
[1862.82 --> 1865.66]  And he does so by telling this parable that we are going to read.
[1865.76 --> 1868.04]  It's called the parable of the great banquet.
[1868.62 --> 1869.64]  Of the great banquet.
[1870.04 --> 1875.36]  So let's read Luke, beginning in verse 15 to 24.
[1875.36 --> 1881.08]  When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus,
[1881.62 --> 1885.44]  Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.
[1886.46 --> 1887.48]  Jesus replied,
[1888.60 --> 1893.00]  A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
[1894.04 --> 1899.62]  At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited,
[1900.22 --> 1903.16]  Come, for everything is now ready.
[1903.16 --> 1907.24]  But they all alike began to make excuses.
[1908.14 --> 1908.82]  The first said,
[1909.04 --> 1911.38]  I have just bought a field and I must go and see to it.
[1911.44 --> 1912.32]  Please excuse me.
[1913.04 --> 1913.96]  Another said,
[1914.18 --> 1918.90]  I have just bought five yoke of oxen and I'm on my way to try them out.
[1919.40 --> 1920.28]  Please excuse me.
[1921.28 --> 1922.22]  Still another said,
[1922.42 --> 1924.22]  I just got married so I can't come.
[1925.28 --> 1928.00]  The servant came back and reported this to the master.
[1928.62 --> 1932.10]  Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant,
[1932.10 --> 1937.68]  Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor,
[1938.16 --> 1940.42]  the crippled, the blind, and the lame.
[1941.50 --> 1943.20]  Sir, the servant said,
[1943.34 --> 1946.26]  What you ordered has been done and there is still room.
[1947.32 --> 1948.66]  Then the master told his servant,
[1949.30 --> 1955.20]  Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full.
[1955.20 --> 1956.48]  I tell you,
[1956.54 --> 1961.00]  not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.
[1962.00 --> 1963.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1965.48 --> 1966.48]  Let's pray together.
[1968.48 --> 1972.32]  Our Father, we thank you again this morning for your word which is true
[1972.32 --> 1975.30]  and that you give to us because you love us.
[1975.30 --> 1979.06]  Lord, you show yourself to be a merciful God
[1979.06 --> 1983.70]  who invites and welcomes us into your banquet.
[1985.26 --> 1991.58]  And so this morning, Lord, help us to taste and to see that you are good
[1991.58 --> 1993.44]  as we feast upon your word.
[1994.14 --> 1995.44]  We pray for Jesus' sake.
[1995.66 --> 1995.86]  Amen.
[1995.86 --> 1995.98]  Amen.
[1998.06 --> 2003.82]  So The Hobbit, that famous Tolkien fantasy story,
[2004.36 --> 2007.30]  which was later turned into a three-part blockbuster movie,
[2008.28 --> 2015.80]  begins with Bilbo Baggins seated at the front stoop of his little hobbit home.
[2016.92 --> 2018.64]  It's in the beautiful morning.
[2018.78 --> 2020.10]  His feet are propped up.
[2020.40 --> 2024.02]  He's staring contentedly into the morning sky, smoking his pipe.
[2024.02 --> 2026.68]  And then Gandalf shows up.
[2027.22 --> 2030.72]  And he invites Bilbo into an adventure.
[2032.04 --> 2033.30]  The scene ends.
[2033.62 --> 2037.50]  The next scene, Bilbo has just made himself dinner
[2037.50 --> 2041.62]  and he's seated at his table in his cozy little hobbit home.
[2042.36 --> 2045.50]  He's got a piece of trout on his plate.
[2045.62 --> 2047.66]  He's squeezing some lemon onto it.
[2048.00 --> 2049.80]  He's tucking in his napkin
[2049.80 --> 2053.00]  and he's getting ready to have just such a wonderful evening.
[2054.02 --> 2055.46]  When there's a knock on the door.
[2056.74 --> 2061.72]  And of course, what ensues is 12 unexpected guests.
[2062.48 --> 2062.92]  Doors.
[2064.04 --> 2068.10]  Popping in with no table manners whatsoever.
[2069.46 --> 2070.10]  Uninvited.
[2070.86 --> 2072.76]  At least not invited by Bilbo.
[2072.76 --> 2077.80]  You know, and God is a bit like Gandalf.
[2077.80 --> 2080.02]  He shows up in this passage.
[2080.54 --> 2085.02]  And he invites all sorts of different characters to a dinner
[2085.02 --> 2090.66]  that we would not necessarily have chosen to invite on our own
[2090.66 --> 2093.68]  without a little nudge from him.
[2093.68 --> 2098.46]  And the kinds of guests that Jesus invites to his table,
[2099.02 --> 2100.46]  to the kingdom of God,
[2101.18 --> 2103.14]  or we could say to the church,
[2103.84 --> 2109.08]  is often also a bit surprising, unexpected to us.
[2110.02 --> 2112.88]  But this, friends, is what God's kingdom is like.
[2113.66 --> 2115.50]  And so as we look at our passage this morning,
[2115.58 --> 2117.58]  as we get a look at this kingdom of God
[2117.58 --> 2120.48]  and all these different kinds of guests who are at his table,
[2121.06 --> 2124.04]  we see the nature of the kingdom of God.
[2124.80 --> 2126.08]  And I want to look at a few things.
[2126.18 --> 2129.30]  We're going to see how Jesus' table is massive.
[2130.40 --> 2134.42]  We're going to see that Jesus' table has unexpected
[2134.42 --> 2136.96]  or a surprising guest list.
[2136.96 --> 2142.22]  And then that Jesus' dinner is prepared with grace.
[2143.06 --> 2145.38]  So that's what I hope for us to look at this morning.
[2145.50 --> 2146.92]  Let's look at the first thing.
[2147.00 --> 2150.72]  Number one, Jesus' dinner table is massive.
[2151.62 --> 2154.14]  So again, Jesus is at a dinner party
[2154.14 --> 2156.78]  where there are Pharisees
[2156.78 --> 2160.72]  and really kind of the A-listers of Jewish society.
[2161.74 --> 2163.48]  And he's been teaching them
[2163.48 --> 2165.84]  what it means to be part of God's kingdom.
[2165.84 --> 2169.40]  And he begins to tell them this parable in verse 16.
[2169.50 --> 2170.92]  So let's look at verse 16 again.
[2171.92 --> 2172.32]  He begins,
[2172.44 --> 2175.16]  A certain man was preparing a great banquet
[2175.16 --> 2177.50]  and invited many guests.
[2178.64 --> 2182.46]  Now, the man in this parable is God.
[2183.40 --> 2185.50]  And the guests are who?
[2186.80 --> 2187.48]  Humanity.
[2188.34 --> 2191.26]  And notice how Jesus describes this banquet.
[2191.82 --> 2194.02]  It's a great banquet.
[2194.02 --> 2196.92]  And many are invited.
[2197.86 --> 2200.16]  Now, let's just pause and think about that for a moment.
[2201.16 --> 2201.38]  Right?
[2201.48 --> 2203.00]  This is great news
[2203.00 --> 2204.84]  because it shows us how God
[2204.84 --> 2209.30]  is so willing to fill up his kingdom.
[2209.76 --> 2213.36]  He is so willing to invite many guests into his house.
[2214.36 --> 2216.46]  You know, sometimes you might hear an objection
[2216.46 --> 2218.58]  to the Christian faith that says,
[2218.58 --> 2220.56]  You know, how can I believe in a God?
[2221.28 --> 2222.68]  How can I believe in Christianity
[2222.68 --> 2226.62]  if it means that so many people are going to hell?
[2227.02 --> 2230.02]  Or it means that so many people are not invited
[2230.02 --> 2232.46]  to God's table.
[2233.90 --> 2237.00]  But when we bring that objection to the Bible,
[2237.70 --> 2240.36]  that's not the God that we find, is it?
[2241.04 --> 2241.28]  Right?
[2241.28 --> 2244.50]  We find a God who does not want anyone to perish
[2244.50 --> 2246.88]  but for everyone to come to repentance.
[2247.52 --> 2248.60]  2 Peter 3.9.
[2249.68 --> 2254.10]  And we find a God who wants to fill up his kingdom.
[2254.38 --> 2254.72]  Right?
[2254.80 --> 2256.18]  Where many are invited.
[2257.46 --> 2259.12]  But the sad reality is that
[2259.12 --> 2264.60]  the people not accepting this invitation of God
[2264.60 --> 2267.32]  is not God's fault.
[2268.62 --> 2268.94]  So,
[2270.94 --> 2271.76]  canons of Dort.
[2272.12 --> 2273.82]  We don't often quote from the canons of Dort,
[2273.96 --> 2276.12]  but, hey, we're a Reformed church.
[2277.08 --> 2279.68]  So, canons of Dort under the third and fourth main
[2279.68 --> 2281.68]  points of doctrine or heads of doctrine.
[2281.68 --> 2283.32]  Article 9 says this.
[2284.64 --> 2287.98]  The fact that many who are called
[2287.98 --> 2289.52]  through the ministry of the gospel
[2289.52 --> 2290.62]  do not come
[2290.62 --> 2292.58]  and are not brought to conversion
[2292.58 --> 2295.44]  must not be blamed on the gospel,
[2296.20 --> 2297.56]  nor on Christ
[2297.56 --> 2299.58]  who is offered through the gospel,
[2300.20 --> 2302.28]  nor on God
[2302.28 --> 2304.76]  who calls them through the gospel
[2304.76 --> 2307.14]  and even bestows various gifts on them,
[2307.92 --> 2309.76]  but on the people themselves
[2309.76 --> 2311.80]  who are called.
[2313.34 --> 2315.34]  Hey, friends, the God we meet in the Bible
[2315.34 --> 2318.42]  is a God who wants many in his kingdom.
[2319.16 --> 2322.12]  And actually, the banquet hall of God
[2322.12 --> 2323.92]  is unfathomably huge.
[2324.84 --> 2326.06]  We look, we get, you know,
[2326.12 --> 2327.12]  in the Apostle John,
[2327.20 --> 2328.18]  in the book of Revelation,
[2328.30 --> 2329.84]  he gives us a glimpse into heaven,
[2330.10 --> 2331.02]  the heaven of God,
[2331.30 --> 2333.76]  and he tells us there is a crowd
[2333.76 --> 2336.82]  gathered around the throne of God
[2336.82 --> 2338.84]  that is so great,
[2339.46 --> 2340.46]  it cannot be numbered.
[2340.46 --> 2344.92]  So, friends, God is not the holdout.
[2346.24 --> 2347.96]  God actually goes out
[2347.96 --> 2349.96]  to the highways and the byways
[2349.96 --> 2353.20]  to bring in even his enemies.
[2354.58 --> 2357.00]  He is a God who would spill his own blood
[2357.00 --> 2359.32]  rather than lose a single sheep.
[2360.40 --> 2361.64]  Okay, that is the heart of God.
[2361.74 --> 2362.82]  And then, you know,
[2363.48 --> 2364.94]  no one, we need to realize,
[2365.10 --> 2367.84]  no one wants people to be saved
[2367.84 --> 2368.62]  more than God.
[2370.28 --> 2374.48]  And when God's massive heart of welcome
[2374.48 --> 2377.22]  gets down into our hearts,
[2377.86 --> 2379.26]  we begin to then see
[2379.26 --> 2382.12]  the expansiveness of God's kingdom.
[2383.50 --> 2385.08]  And then as we read Luke's gospel,
[2385.18 --> 2387.72]  you know, we see so many clues earlier on
[2387.72 --> 2389.70]  that this is not going to be,
[2389.76 --> 2390.86]  you know, this banquet of God,
[2390.92 --> 2392.22]  it's not going to be a nice setting
[2392.22 --> 2393.20]  of religious people
[2393.20 --> 2395.52]  who all who have just walk in
[2395.52 --> 2396.74]  and have all their lives together.
[2398.08 --> 2398.48]  Right?
[2398.54 --> 2401.86]  It's going to extend far and wide.
[2403.08 --> 2404.76]  So Jesus' table is massive
[2404.76 --> 2406.46]  and he wants to fill it.
[2406.56 --> 2407.36]  That's the first thing.
[2408.08 --> 2409.66]  Now, the second thing we see here
[2409.66 --> 2411.26]  about the nature of the kingdom
[2411.26 --> 2413.86]  is that Jesus' dinner table
[2413.86 --> 2417.90]  has a surprising guest list.
[2417.90 --> 2422.08]  So Jesus, you know, his banquet,
[2422.34 --> 2424.58]  it starts like any good party would start
[2424.58 --> 2427.62]  with planning well ahead of time.
[2428.20 --> 2430.04]  So their version of an invite
[2430.04 --> 2432.20]  goes out into the, you know,
[2432.30 --> 2434.06]  the mailboxes,
[2434.96 --> 2436.10]  the emails maybe,
[2436.92 --> 2438.66]  long in advance.
[2439.10 --> 2440.58]  You get that invite maybe to a wedding
[2440.58 --> 2441.70]  or a party, right?
[2441.70 --> 2446.26]  And the RSVPs were expected
[2446.26 --> 2448.44]  so that the host could know who's coming
[2448.44 --> 2449.82]  and they could prepare how much food.
[2450.82 --> 2453.36]  And the RSVPs start flooding in.
[2453.48 --> 2455.02]  Yes, yes, yes.
[2455.46 --> 2456.34]  You know, plus one.
[2456.86 --> 2457.72]  We're coming.
[2457.90 --> 2458.54]  All this stuff.
[2459.34 --> 2462.04]  So the guests are already accepting
[2462.04 --> 2463.42]  the invitation to the party.
[2463.88 --> 2467.02]  They were then expected to come.
[2467.02 --> 2471.84]  The day arrives of the banquet.
[2473.00 --> 2475.86]  Now, unlike our banquets
[2475.86 --> 2477.64]  or our weddings or our dinner parties,
[2478.16 --> 2479.84]  they didn't just wait for the guests
[2479.84 --> 2481.12]  to show up at the house
[2481.12 --> 2482.54]  who had been invited.
[2483.10 --> 2484.94]  They don't simply just wait for them to show up.
[2485.24 --> 2487.74]  Back then, that was not hospitable enough.
[2488.56 --> 2489.66]  So on the day of the banquet,
[2490.20 --> 2492.24]  the generous and eager host
[2492.24 --> 2494.60]  sent his servants out into the village
[2494.60 --> 2496.24]  to beckon them to come.
[2497.02 --> 2499.36]  To the banquet that they had already agreed
[2499.36 --> 2500.88]  that they would come to.
[2501.52 --> 2502.88]  He goes and calls them,
[2503.40 --> 2504.60]  escorts them to the banquet.
[2505.48 --> 2506.82]  So look at verse 17.
[2507.92 --> 2509.14]  At the time of the banquet,
[2509.62 --> 2511.26]  he sent his servant to tell those
[2511.26 --> 2512.28]  who had been invited,
[2512.84 --> 2514.22]  come for everything is now ready.
[2516.30 --> 2518.44]  But to the utter dismay
[2518.44 --> 2520.10]  of the host
[2520.10 --> 2522.42]  and to the shock
[2522.42 --> 2523.66]  of the listeners
[2523.66 --> 2524.80]  of Jesus' parable,
[2525.84 --> 2527.24]  this yes list
[2527.24 --> 2530.70]  slowly begins to dwindle.
[2532.00 --> 2533.30]  Have you ever experienced that?
[2534.76 --> 2534.98]  Right?
[2535.02 --> 2536.18]  Maybe you planned a party
[2536.18 --> 2537.70]  for even a couple weeks.
[2538.50 --> 2539.76]  You've carefully selected
[2539.76 --> 2541.00]  the invitation list.
[2541.10 --> 2541.22]  Right?
[2541.24 --> 2541.62]  You've gotten
[2541.62 --> 2543.70]  all of these enthusiastic yeses.
[2544.32 --> 2544.92]  Maybe kids,
[2544.98 --> 2546.00]  you're having like a birthday party.
[2546.30 --> 2547.00]  You got all of your friends
[2547.00 --> 2547.54]  are going to come.
[2548.66 --> 2549.58]  So you've prepared.
[2549.68 --> 2550.10]  You got maybe,
[2550.20 --> 2550.46]  let's say,
[2550.52 --> 2551.48]  20 people.
[2552.02 --> 2553.28]  You've cleaned the house.
[2553.76 --> 2554.82]  You've set the table.
[2555.00 --> 2556.10]  You've purchased the groceries.
[2556.42 --> 2557.38]  You've prepared the food.
[2557.46 --> 2558.28]  You've lit the candles.
[2558.66 --> 2559.30]  You've decorated.
[2559.48 --> 2560.20]  It's all done.
[2561.48 --> 2562.50]  And then at the last minute,
[2562.60 --> 2563.24]  12 people
[2563.24 --> 2564.08]  out of the 20
[2564.08 --> 2565.16]  are saying,
[2565.66 --> 2566.86]  sorry,
[2567.00 --> 2567.78]  something came up.
[2568.46 --> 2569.06]  Or, you know,
[2569.06 --> 2570.32]  I'm feeling a little tired tonight.
[2570.32 --> 2571.94]  Or, you know,
[2571.96 --> 2573.30]  I got this other thing going on.
[2574.14 --> 2574.80]  And now,
[2574.92 --> 2575.76]  it's a party of eight
[2575.76 --> 2579.20]  with 12 empty seats
[2579.20 --> 2579.94]  at the table.
[2581.30 --> 2583.44]  That's what's being described here.
[2584.70 --> 2586.28]  And in verses 18 to 20,
[2586.42 --> 2588.82]  we hear all of these excuses
[2588.82 --> 2590.36]  that are made.
[2591.18 --> 2592.34]  So the first said,
[2592.82 --> 2593.84]  I have just bought a field.
[2593.90 --> 2595.04]  I must go and see it.
[2595.36 --> 2596.20]  Please excuse me.
[2597.08 --> 2597.90]  Another said,
[2597.90 --> 2598.96]  I have just bought
[2598.96 --> 2600.06]  five yoke of oxen
[2600.06 --> 2601.38]  and I'm on my way
[2601.38 --> 2602.30]  to try them out.
[2602.70 --> 2603.72]  Please excuse me.
[2605.06 --> 2606.12]  Still another said,
[2606.24 --> 2607.12]  I just got married
[2607.12 --> 2607.82]  so I can't come.
[2608.76 --> 2609.96]  No, please excuse me.
[2612.32 --> 2614.02]  Now, at first glance,
[2614.28 --> 2615.02]  these excuses
[2615.02 --> 2616.16]  may appear
[2616.16 --> 2616.94]  to be legitimate.
[2617.78 --> 2617.98]  Right?
[2618.04 --> 2619.02]  They speak about property,
[2619.32 --> 2620.16]  work, family.
[2620.94 --> 2622.06]  I need to go inspect
[2622.06 --> 2622.68]  my property.
[2622.80 --> 2623.32]  I need to go
[2623.32 --> 2624.94]  and check on my work.
[2625.04 --> 2625.20]  Right?
[2625.24 --> 2626.08]  I've got these oxen
[2626.08 --> 2626.90]  I've invested in.
[2627.90 --> 2628.58]  I need to go
[2628.58 --> 2629.66]  and be with my wife.
[2629.88 --> 2631.10]  And even that last one
[2631.10 --> 2631.86]  has the backing
[2631.86 --> 2632.66]  of the Old Testament.
[2633.50 --> 2633.72]  Right?
[2633.78 --> 2634.94]  Where an Israelite man
[2634.94 --> 2635.66]  gets married,
[2636.28 --> 2637.16]  he gets to avoid
[2637.16 --> 2637.90]  going to war
[2637.90 --> 2638.80]  for a whole year
[2638.80 --> 2640.42]  to be with his wife.
[2642.22 --> 2643.16]  But actually,
[2643.54 --> 2645.12]  these are lame excuses.
[2646.46 --> 2647.56]  And in the culture
[2647.56 --> 2649.80]  of the ancient Near East,
[2650.80 --> 2653.10]  which so highly valued
[2653.10 --> 2653.82]  hospitality,
[2653.82 --> 2655.80]  their excuses
[2655.80 --> 2657.30]  are in insulting
[2657.30 --> 2658.60]  disregard
[2658.60 --> 2660.24]  and disrespect
[2660.24 --> 2661.68]  towards the host.
[2663.60 --> 2664.46]  So how does
[2664.46 --> 2665.56]  the master respond?
[2666.10 --> 2668.00]  How does Jesus respond?
[2669.08 --> 2670.40]  We see it in verse 21.
[2671.36 --> 2672.58]  The servant came back
[2672.58 --> 2673.38]  and reported this
[2673.38 --> 2674.00]  to the master.
[2674.42 --> 2675.14]  Then the owner
[2675.14 --> 2676.18]  of the house
[2676.18 --> 2676.88]  became angry.
[2678.16 --> 2679.18]  So we see here
[2679.18 --> 2679.98]  that these excuses
[2679.98 --> 2680.88]  are not acceptable
[2680.88 --> 2682.32]  to Jesus.
[2682.32 --> 2683.72]  You know,
[2683.80 --> 2684.46]  in this anger,
[2684.58 --> 2684.76]  he says,
[2684.86 --> 2685.44]  the owner of the house
[2685.44 --> 2686.04]  became angry.
[2686.14 --> 2686.64]  This anger
[2686.64 --> 2688.34]  has less to do
[2688.34 --> 2689.52]  with their change of mind,
[2689.56 --> 2690.98]  as annoying as that is,
[2691.64 --> 2692.84]  than it does
[2692.84 --> 2693.64]  with the condition
[2693.64 --> 2694.84]  of their hearts
[2694.84 --> 2696.20]  towards him
[2696.20 --> 2697.74]  and towards the kingdom,
[2698.26 --> 2699.04]  towards his banquet.
[2699.04 --> 2700.54]  See,
[2700.60 --> 2701.70]  because what's going on here
[2701.70 --> 2702.88]  is that these guests,
[2702.96 --> 2703.80]  for these guests,
[2704.96 --> 2706.44]  a feast with God
[2706.44 --> 2708.82]  sounds less amazing,
[2709.96 --> 2710.80]  less delicious,
[2711.64 --> 2712.86]  less enticing,
[2712.86 --> 2714.54]  than all of these
[2714.54 --> 2715.86]  lesser options.
[2717.38 --> 2717.60]  Right?
[2717.66 --> 2718.50]  They've developed
[2718.50 --> 2719.24]  a hunger
[2719.24 --> 2721.24]  for finite,
[2721.44 --> 2722.38]  temporary things,
[2722.48 --> 2723.36]  and they've lost
[2723.36 --> 2723.92]  their hunger
[2723.92 --> 2724.96]  for the infinite
[2724.96 --> 2726.02]  and eternal God.
[2726.02 --> 2728.86]  He's become
[2728.86 --> 2730.02]  less desirable
[2730.02 --> 2731.16]  in their eyes,
[2731.72 --> 2732.50]  less interesting,
[2733.20 --> 2734.66]  less of a wonderful
[2734.66 --> 2735.62]  mystery
[2735.62 --> 2736.84]  to them
[2736.84 --> 2737.28]  than maybe
[2737.28 --> 2738.48]  he had once
[2738.48 --> 2739.30]  been
[2739.30 --> 2740.00]  when they accepted
[2740.00 --> 2740.64]  the invitation.
[2743.52 --> 2743.70]  You know,
[2743.76 --> 2744.10]  and notice,
[2744.20 --> 2745.08]  Jesus isn't saying
[2745.08 --> 2745.58]  that these things
[2745.58 --> 2746.24]  are bad.
[2747.02 --> 2747.24]  Right?
[2747.28 --> 2747.98]  These excuses
[2747.98 --> 2749.32]  that the guests
[2749.32 --> 2749.66]  are giving,
[2749.74 --> 2750.90]  they're not bad things,
[2750.94 --> 2751.08]  right?
[2751.10 --> 2751.94]  They're good things.
[2752.54 --> 2753.28]  Buying a field,
[2753.94 --> 2754.76]  admiring the field
[2754.76 --> 2755.30]  that you bought.
[2756.02 --> 2757.06]  Buying some oxen
[2757.06 --> 2758.46]  and inspecting them,
[2758.52 --> 2758.92]  making sure
[2758.92 --> 2759.72]  they're good quality,
[2760.00 --> 2761.28]  that they're evenly matched,
[2761.30 --> 2761.70]  that they're going
[2761.70 --> 2762.44]  to do good work.
[2763.30 --> 2764.38]  Spending quality time
[2764.38 --> 2764.98]  with your spouse,
[2765.06 --> 2765.18]  right?
[2765.20 --> 2766.30]  These are all good things,
[2766.32 --> 2767.00]  and God says,
[2767.32 --> 2768.04]  these are things
[2768.04 --> 2769.32]  that I have given you.
[2769.98 --> 2770.40]  Right?
[2770.46 --> 2771.28]  These are my gifts
[2771.28 --> 2772.18]  to you,
[2772.70 --> 2774.10]  but the problem is
[2774.10 --> 2774.52]  you're taking
[2774.52 --> 2775.74]  these gifts of mine,
[2776.42 --> 2777.68]  these good things
[2777.68 --> 2778.28]  I've given you
[2778.28 --> 2778.96]  by my grace,
[2778.98 --> 2779.82]  and you're turning them
[2779.82 --> 2781.32]  into ultimate things.
[2781.74 --> 2782.32]  You're taking
[2782.32 --> 2783.56]  these things down here,
[2783.58 --> 2784.44]  and you're putting them
[2784.44 --> 2785.80]  in the number one place,
[2785.80 --> 2786.98]  in your heart,
[2787.50 --> 2789.74]  and you're taking
[2789.74 --> 2791.06]  the place of me
[2791.06 --> 2792.38]  in my banquet.
[2794.22 --> 2794.44]  You know,
[2794.68 --> 2795.40]  C.S. Lewis says
[2795.40 --> 2796.18]  something similar
[2796.18 --> 2797.54]  in Mere Christianity.
[2798.54 --> 2799.44]  He says that
[2799.44 --> 2800.90]  God invented
[2800.90 --> 2801.78]  human beings
[2801.78 --> 2803.14]  in the same way
[2803.14 --> 2804.08]  that a human being
[2804.08 --> 2805.40]  invents an engine
[2805.40 --> 2806.08]  of a car.
[2807.20 --> 2808.10]  And an engine
[2808.10 --> 2809.64]  only thrives,
[2809.72 --> 2810.96]  an engine only runs
[2810.96 --> 2811.58]  on gas.
[2811.58 --> 2812.90]  If you try to put
[2812.90 --> 2814.08]  something else in there,
[2814.28 --> 2815.06]  it's just going
[2815.06 --> 2815.66]  to break down.
[2816.82 --> 2817.50]  And the same thing
[2817.50 --> 2818.20]  is true about
[2818.20 --> 2819.00]  a human being.
[2819.72 --> 2819.82]  Right?
[2819.90 --> 2821.08]  A human being
[2821.08 --> 2823.02]  will only run,
[2823.58 --> 2824.58]  it will only thrive
[2824.58 --> 2825.68]  on God,
[2826.22 --> 2828.28]  not on anything else.
[2828.42 --> 2830.42]  God is the fuel.
[2831.80 --> 2832.94]  And for these guests,
[2833.00 --> 2833.80]  with all the excuses,
[2834.26 --> 2835.18]  they had all these
[2835.18 --> 2836.28]  other options
[2836.28 --> 2837.66]  that they could attend to.
[2838.62 --> 2839.70]  And so what they were doing
[2839.70 --> 2841.04]  is that they chose
[2841.04 --> 2842.74]  those things
[2842.74 --> 2843.78]  over God
[2843.78 --> 2844.72]  and over his banquet.
[2845.82 --> 2846.74]  And that's why
[2846.74 --> 2847.74]  in verse 24,
[2847.94 --> 2848.98]  this is what Jesus says.
[2849.08 --> 2849.70]  Verse 24.
[2851.00 --> 2851.28]  He says,
[2851.40 --> 2852.08]  I tell you,
[2852.16 --> 2853.24]  not one of those
[2853.24 --> 2853.84]  who were invited
[2853.84 --> 2855.12]  will get a taste
[2855.12 --> 2855.64]  of my banquet.
[2856.56 --> 2856.98]  Right?
[2857.02 --> 2857.60]  And that's not like
[2857.60 --> 2859.06]  a punitive statement.
[2859.58 --> 2861.20]  That's just the consequences
[2861.20 --> 2862.92]  of their choice
[2862.92 --> 2863.76]  to disregard
[2863.76 --> 2864.66]  the invitation
[2864.66 --> 2865.66]  that God had given them.
[2866.70 --> 2866.88]  Right?
[2866.88 --> 2867.72]  Those who refuse
[2867.72 --> 2868.48]  the invitation
[2868.48 --> 2870.06]  simply don't get
[2870.06 --> 2871.28]  to taste God's banquet.
[2873.10 --> 2873.74]  So look,
[2873.86 --> 2874.76]  the application
[2874.76 --> 2875.56]  is not difficult
[2875.56 --> 2876.36]  for us to see,
[2876.42 --> 2876.70]  is it?
[2877.38 --> 2878.52]  So all we have to do
[2878.52 --> 2879.54]  is ask ourselves,
[2879.72 --> 2880.44]  in what ways
[2880.44 --> 2881.72]  am I feasting
[2881.72 --> 2883.06]  on leisure
[2883.06 --> 2885.16]  or work
[2885.16 --> 2887.00]  or family
[2887.00 --> 2889.44]  such a way
[2889.44 --> 2890.86]  that I would rather
[2890.86 --> 2892.52]  feast on those things
[2892.52 --> 2893.92]  than on God?
[2894.42 --> 2894.96]  And maybe God
[2894.96 --> 2895.80]  is just a snack.
[2896.88 --> 2897.68]  Right?
[2897.74 --> 2898.52]  What has become
[2898.52 --> 2899.64]  delicious
[2899.64 --> 2901.50]  and desirable
[2901.50 --> 2903.38]  in your life?
[2905.54 --> 2907.38]  Has the nuclear family
[2907.38 --> 2908.44]  become the nucleus
[2908.44 --> 2910.14]  of your life?
[2910.52 --> 2911.16]  And maybe God
[2911.16 --> 2912.06]  is on the periphery
[2912.06 --> 2914.00]  or your work
[2914.00 --> 2914.74]  or your,
[2915.04 --> 2915.82]  or anything,
[2915.96 --> 2916.22]  leisure.
[2916.22 --> 2920.30]  So that's what's going
[2920.30 --> 2921.20]  on with these guests
[2921.20 --> 2921.62]  and they
[2921.62 --> 2923.08]  say,
[2923.16 --> 2923.42]  sorry,
[2923.52 --> 2924.00]  I'm going to go
[2924.00 --> 2924.84]  do these other things
[2924.84 --> 2925.18]  instead.
[2925.56 --> 2925.84]  Now,
[2925.94 --> 2926.66]  who actually
[2926.66 --> 2927.40]  ends up coming
[2927.40 --> 2928.48]  to the banquet?
[2929.00 --> 2930.24]  Let's look at verse 21.
[2930.24 --> 2932.60]  Then the owner
[2932.60 --> 2933.24]  of the house
[2933.24 --> 2933.94]  became angry
[2933.94 --> 2934.94]  and ordered his servants
[2934.94 --> 2935.86]  go out quickly
[2935.86 --> 2936.88]  into the streets
[2936.88 --> 2938.34]  and alleys of the town.
[2938.72 --> 2939.98]  Bring in the poor,
[2940.28 --> 2940.86]  the crippled,
[2940.92 --> 2941.66]  the blind,
[2942.28 --> 2942.96]  and the lame.
[2942.96 --> 2944.94]  So who comes
[2944.94 --> 2945.40]  to the banquet?
[2946.60 --> 2947.56]  It's the poor,
[2948.70 --> 2949.50]  the crippled,
[2950.28 --> 2951.06]  the blind,
[2951.64 --> 2952.24]  and the lame.
[2952.74 --> 2954.06]  The outcasts
[2954.06 --> 2954.72]  of society.
[2955.18 --> 2955.82]  The people
[2955.82 --> 2956.84]  who are outside
[2956.84 --> 2957.64]  the temple,
[2958.60 --> 2959.16]  so to speak,
[2959.26 --> 2960.30]  begging at the gate.
[2960.98 --> 2961.10]  Right?
[2961.16 --> 2962.48]  Those who are ostracized
[2962.48 --> 2963.44]  from daily society.
[2963.64 --> 2964.66]  They are the ones
[2964.66 --> 2965.30]  that come in
[2965.30 --> 2966.46]  and they are,
[2966.56 --> 2966.94]  in fact,
[2967.00 --> 2967.84]  the very people
[2967.84 --> 2969.30]  whom the Jews
[2969.30 --> 2970.02]  at the time
[2970.02 --> 2970.40]  of Jesus
[2970.40 --> 2972.06]  would not think
[2972.06 --> 2973.34]  would be invited
[2973.34 --> 2974.52]  to God's banquet.
[2975.96 --> 2976.24]  And yet,
[2976.32 --> 2976.94]  Jesus says
[2976.94 --> 2978.90]  those are exactly
[2978.90 --> 2980.08]  the people
[2980.08 --> 2981.44]  that God wants
[2981.44 --> 2982.62]  at his table.
[2984.50 --> 2985.10]  Because
[2985.10 --> 2986.80]  what excuses
[2986.80 --> 2989.60]  were the poor,
[2990.12 --> 2991.42]  the lame,
[2991.50 --> 2992.08]  or the blind
[2992.08 --> 2993.08]  going to offer
[2993.08 --> 2994.06]  for why they
[2994.06 --> 2994.82]  couldn't come?
[2995.90 --> 2996.12]  Right?
[2996.18 --> 2996.48]  Do you see
[2996.48 --> 2997.54]  what God is doing here?
[2997.54 --> 2998.80]  He's removed
[2998.80 --> 2999.72]  excuses from
[2999.72 --> 3000.32]  their lives.
[3001.46 --> 3001.86]  Right?
[3001.94 --> 3002.58]  God gives you
[3002.58 --> 3003.42]  all these oxen.
[3003.80 --> 3004.30]  You say,
[3004.70 --> 3004.92]  ah,
[3005.02 --> 3006.22]  God has blessed me.
[3007.30 --> 3008.28]  God invites you
[3008.28 --> 3008.80]  to a banquet.
[3009.66 --> 3011.14]  But I have to go
[3011.14 --> 3011.66]  and look after
[3011.66 --> 3012.18]  my oxen
[3012.18 --> 3012.54]  that God has
[3012.54 --> 3013.20]  blessed me with.
[3014.36 --> 3015.42]  So I can't come.
[3017.14 --> 3018.24]  God has taken
[3018.24 --> 3019.18]  away my eyesight.
[3019.32 --> 3019.98]  I am blind.
[3020.34 --> 3021.52]  God has cursed me.
[3022.60 --> 3023.46]  God invites you
[3023.46 --> 3023.98]  to a banquet.
[3025.20 --> 3025.38]  Well,
[3025.38 --> 3025.92]  I've got nothing
[3025.92 --> 3026.60]  else to do.
[3027.54 --> 3028.44]  I'm going to go.
[3030.80 --> 3031.44]  You see what
[3031.44 --> 3031.80]  he's doing?
[3032.96 --> 3034.10]  The types of people
[3034.10 --> 3035.08]  who come to the banquet
[3035.08 --> 3036.10]  really don't have
[3036.10 --> 3037.68]  anything else to do.
[3037.98 --> 3038.38]  They don't have
[3038.38 --> 3039.58]  anywhere else to go.
[3039.80 --> 3040.86]  There's nothing else
[3040.86 --> 3042.18]  that is more desirable
[3042.18 --> 3043.00]  to them
[3043.00 --> 3044.20]  than God himself.
[3046.22 --> 3047.06]  So they go
[3047.06 --> 3048.08]  and they feast on God.
[3049.82 --> 3051.04]  And that's Jesus'
[3051.30 --> 3052.60]  surprising guest list.
[3053.00 --> 3053.52]  The poor,
[3053.84 --> 3054.36]  the crippled,
[3054.44 --> 3054.82]  the blind,
[3054.92 --> 3055.28]  the lame,
[3055.60 --> 3056.70]  Jews and Gentiles,
[3056.70 --> 3058.62]  sinners and tax collectors,
[3059.02 --> 3060.36]  everyone whom Jesus
[3060.36 --> 3061.46]  compels to come.
[3063.68 --> 3064.48]  And then the last thing
[3064.48 --> 3065.30]  we see here
[3065.30 --> 3066.16]  about the nature
[3066.16 --> 3067.22]  of the kingdom of God
[3067.22 --> 3068.66]  is that it's a table
[3068.66 --> 3069.72]  prepared by grace.
[3071.16 --> 3072.12]  Jesus' table
[3072.12 --> 3072.76]  is massive.
[3073.40 --> 3074.06]  It is,
[3074.16 --> 3074.80]  it's a table
[3074.80 --> 3075.88]  that has a surprising
[3075.88 --> 3076.72]  guest list.
[3077.58 --> 3078.62]  And it's a table
[3078.62 --> 3080.38]  prepared with grace.
[3081.02 --> 3081.88]  So the parable
[3081.88 --> 3083.36]  ends with this little bit
[3083.36 --> 3084.18]  in verse 23.
[3084.18 --> 3085.86]  Then the master
[3085.86 --> 3086.76]  told his servant,
[3086.96 --> 3088.40]  go out to the roads
[3088.40 --> 3089.48]  and country lanes,
[3089.92 --> 3091.24]  compel them to come in
[3091.24 --> 3093.16]  so that my house
[3093.16 --> 3094.24]  will be full.
[3095.68 --> 3096.22]  Right?
[3096.26 --> 3097.06]  And you see that last
[3097.06 --> 3097.66]  phrase there.
[3098.84 --> 3100.34]  He's talking about
[3100.34 --> 3102.44]  all of the outsiders,
[3102.78 --> 3103.18]  the outcasts,
[3104.10 --> 3105.34]  coming in.
[3105.34 --> 3107.28]  But then all of a sudden
[3107.28 --> 3108.38]  we realize that Jesus
[3108.38 --> 3110.10]  says it's his house.
[3111.16 --> 3112.76]  Because he has laid down
[3112.76 --> 3113.70]  his life
[3113.70 --> 3115.10]  for the sinners,
[3115.62 --> 3117.32]  for the blind,
[3117.48 --> 3118.08]  the lame,
[3118.30 --> 3119.02]  for the Jews
[3119.02 --> 3119.82]  and the Gentiles,
[3119.90 --> 3120.36]  for the sinner
[3120.36 --> 3121.24]  and the tax collector.
[3121.48 --> 3122.26]  He did it.
[3122.32 --> 3123.30]  It is his house.
[3123.96 --> 3124.92]  It is his banquet.
[3127.92 --> 3128.36]  Now,
[3128.92 --> 3129.44]  there's,
[3129.54 --> 3129.66]  you know,
[3129.66 --> 3131.00]  we looked to the
[3131.00 --> 3131.72]  canons of Dort.
[3131.72 --> 3132.54]  Now I'm going to kind of
[3132.54 --> 3133.06]  go on the opposite
[3133.06 --> 3133.78]  end of the spectrum.
[3134.36 --> 3135.08]  There's a song
[3135.08 --> 3136.42]  by the country singer
[3136.42 --> 3137.42]  Toby Keith.
[3138.30 --> 3138.74]  Now,
[3138.90 --> 3139.74]  I don't listen to
[3139.74 --> 3140.40]  country music
[3140.40 --> 3141.64]  at all.
[3141.84 --> 3143.12]  But I know some of you do.
[3144.26 --> 3144.70]  So,
[3144.92 --> 3146.16]  and I heard about this song.
[3146.24 --> 3147.02]  I think it's actually
[3147.02 --> 3148.22]  a great description
[3148.22 --> 3150.10]  of the kingdom of God,
[3150.14 --> 3150.90]  of God's banquet.
[3151.54 --> 3152.22]  It's called
[3152.22 --> 3153.54]  I Love This Bar.
[3153.78 --> 3154.78]  Does anybody know this song?
[3155.86 --> 3156.12]  Okay,
[3156.20 --> 3157.28]  a couple people know this song.
[3157.64 --> 3158.06]  That's great.
[3158.06 --> 3158.58]  So,
[3158.70 --> 3159.82]  here's some of the lyrics.
[3161.16 --> 3162.20]  We got winners.
[3162.44 --> 3163.14]  We got losers.
[3163.64 --> 3164.34]  Chain smokers
[3164.34 --> 3164.94]  and boozers.
[3165.28 --> 3165.92]  We got yuppies.
[3166.00 --> 3166.64]  We got bikers.
[3166.76 --> 3168.06]  We got thirsty hitchhikers.
[3168.80 --> 3170.02]  We got cowboys.
[3170.22 --> 3171.08]  We got truckers.
[3171.52 --> 3172.64]  Broken hearted fools
[3172.64 --> 3173.32]  and suckers.
[3173.60 --> 3174.62]  And we got hustlers.
[3174.76 --> 3175.36]  We got fighters.
[3176.00 --> 3176.86]  Early birds
[3176.86 --> 3177.84]  and all-nighters.
[3178.50 --> 3179.60]  I love this bar.
[3179.70 --> 3180.70]  It's my kind of place.
[3181.06 --> 3181.94]  Just walking through
[3181.94 --> 3182.56]  the front door
[3182.56 --> 3183.48]  puts a big smile
[3183.48 --> 3184.40]  on my face.
[3185.22 --> 3186.60]  No cover charge.
[3186.60 --> 3188.66]  Come as you are.
[3189.24 --> 3190.60]  I just love this old bar.
[3191.88 --> 3192.40]  Poetry.
[3195.98 --> 3196.54]  Now,
[3196.68 --> 3197.42]  the similarity
[3197.42 --> 3199.48]  between a bar
[3199.48 --> 3201.48]  and Jesus' table
[3201.48 --> 3203.52]  is that all are welcome.
[3205.16 --> 3205.68]  Right?
[3205.72 --> 3206.28]  And the church
[3206.28 --> 3208.16]  is the kind of place
[3208.16 --> 3208.70]  where you've got
[3208.70 --> 3210.28]  all kinds of characters in it.
[3211.00 --> 3211.46]  Right?
[3211.50 --> 3212.32]  Just look around this room.
[3212.32 --> 3215.26]  Jesus invites
[3215.26 --> 3216.96]  all kinds of people
[3216.96 --> 3217.92]  into his house.
[3219.36 --> 3220.50]  But there's a difference
[3220.50 --> 3221.10]  as well.
[3221.52 --> 3222.36]  The difference is
[3222.36 --> 3223.54]  there is a cover charge.
[3225.02 --> 3225.94]  And the price
[3225.94 --> 3227.44]  of your ticket
[3227.44 --> 3228.44]  at his table
[3228.44 --> 3230.12]  is actually
[3230.12 --> 3230.86]  the cost
[3230.86 --> 3231.98]  of Jesus' own life.
[3233.48 --> 3233.80]  You see,
[3233.86 --> 3234.26]  what makes
[3234.26 --> 3235.38]  this feast
[3235.38 --> 3236.18]  of the kingdom
[3236.18 --> 3237.56]  so unique
[3237.56 --> 3238.50]  is that
[3238.50 --> 3239.38]  Jesus doesn't
[3239.38 --> 3240.62]  just prepare
[3240.62 --> 3241.34]  the feast.
[3241.68 --> 3242.98]  He is
[3242.98 --> 3244.30]  the feast.
[3245.54 --> 3246.52]  When we sit
[3246.52 --> 3247.28]  down at the table,
[3247.38 --> 3248.14]  he serves us
[3248.14 --> 3249.16]  with the bread
[3249.16 --> 3250.58]  of the body
[3250.58 --> 3251.04]  of Christ
[3251.04 --> 3251.96]  broken for us.
[3252.82 --> 3253.90]  And when we drink
[3253.90 --> 3254.52]  at his table,
[3254.62 --> 3255.56]  we drink the cup
[3255.56 --> 3256.28]  of the new covenant,
[3256.46 --> 3257.28]  which is the blood
[3257.28 --> 3257.86]  of Christ.
[3258.62 --> 3259.68]  And he knows
[3259.68 --> 3260.52]  that we are blind
[3260.52 --> 3261.10]  and pitiful
[3261.10 --> 3261.98]  and lame
[3261.98 --> 3262.50]  and poor.
[3262.80 --> 3263.60]  So when we walk
[3263.60 --> 3264.52]  through that door,
[3264.66 --> 3265.76]  he covers us
[3265.76 --> 3266.74]  with the righteousness
[3266.74 --> 3268.00]  of Christ.
[3269.78 --> 3270.24]  And so friends,
[3270.38 --> 3271.18]  no one brings
[3271.18 --> 3271.82]  a bottle
[3271.82 --> 3273.10]  of wine
[3273.10 --> 3274.08]  to God's banquet.
[3275.22 --> 3275.70]  Right?
[3275.76 --> 3276.58]  You don't bring
[3276.58 --> 3277.12]  a salad,
[3277.38 --> 3278.06]  you don't bring
[3278.06 --> 3278.64]  the dessert,
[3278.94 --> 3279.42]  you don't bring
[3279.42 --> 3279.88]  the soup
[3279.88 --> 3280.64]  or the buns.
[3281.44 --> 3282.92]  He provides
[3282.92 --> 3283.90]  everything.
[3284.30 --> 3284.68]  Come,
[3285.32 --> 3285.90]  for everything
[3285.90 --> 3286.36]  is ready.
[3287.30 --> 3287.92]  That's what
[3287.92 --> 3288.84]  the invitation is.
[3289.60 --> 3290.66]  And the only thing
[3290.66 --> 3291.52]  that you bring
[3291.52 --> 3292.24]  to the banquet
[3292.24 --> 3292.96]  of God
[3292.96 --> 3294.26]  is your appetite.
[3294.26 --> 3296.08]  The only thing
[3296.08 --> 3296.44]  we bring
[3296.44 --> 3297.60]  is empty hands
[3297.60 --> 3300.20]  and hungry hearts.
[3302.64 --> 3304.00]  Martin Lloyd-Jones
[3304.00 --> 3304.80]  was a great
[3304.80 --> 3305.60]  Welsh preacher
[3305.60 --> 3307.68]  and he would
[3307.68 --> 3308.76]  regularly ask
[3308.76 --> 3309.80]  people that he met,
[3310.52 --> 3311.88]  are you a Christian?
[3312.90 --> 3314.00]  And he says
[3314.00 --> 3314.66]  there are two
[3314.66 --> 3315.66]  different answers
[3315.66 --> 3317.42]  that he would get
[3317.42 --> 3317.92]  from people
[3317.92 --> 3318.34]  when he asked
[3318.34 --> 3318.76]  that question,
[3318.80 --> 3319.40]  are you a Christian?
[3319.66 --> 3321.30]  The first answer
[3321.30 --> 3321.82]  is,
[3322.82 --> 3323.12]  you know,
[3323.12 --> 3323.74]  I'm trying
[3323.74 --> 3324.50]  really hard
[3324.50 --> 3325.30]  to be a Christian.
[3326.68 --> 3327.62]  And Lloyd-Jones
[3327.62 --> 3328.10]  would say,
[3328.24 --> 3328.36]  well,
[3328.42 --> 3328.92]  that person
[3328.92 --> 3329.90]  hasn't yet tasted
[3329.90 --> 3331.48]  what it means
[3331.48 --> 3331.98]  to feast
[3331.98 --> 3332.50]  at the table
[3332.50 --> 3332.92]  of God.
[3334.48 --> 3335.26]  And the second
[3335.26 --> 3335.96]  person answers
[3335.96 --> 3336.50]  the question,
[3336.70 --> 3337.36]  are you a Christian?
[3337.98 --> 3338.84]  With this,
[3339.68 --> 3340.16]  yes,
[3340.28 --> 3340.94]  I am.
[3341.10 --> 3342.34]  Can you
[3342.34 --> 3343.36]  believe it?
[3344.94 --> 3345.40]  Yes,
[3345.42 --> 3345.66]  I am.
[3345.72 --> 3346.64]  Can you believe it?
[3348.18 --> 3348.62]  Right?
[3348.70 --> 3348.92]  You see,
[3348.98 --> 3349.98]  Jesus' invitation
[3349.98 --> 3350.64]  is not based
[3350.64 --> 3351.30]  on anything
[3351.30 --> 3351.72]  where you
[3351.72 --> 3352.20]  could say,
[3352.46 --> 3352.74]  oh,
[3352.82 --> 3353.62]  this person,
[3353.72 --> 3354.66]  I can see
[3354.66 --> 3355.52]  why God
[3355.52 --> 3356.22]  invited that
[3356.22 --> 3356.96]  person to
[3356.96 --> 3357.92]  his kingdom.
[3358.60 --> 3358.82]  Right?
[3358.84 --> 3359.36]  I can see
[3359.36 --> 3359.98]  why Jesus
[3359.98 --> 3361.36]  invited him
[3361.36 --> 3362.08]  or her.
[3363.20 --> 3363.44]  Right?
[3363.50 --> 3363.68]  No,
[3363.76 --> 3364.62]  there is no one
[3364.62 --> 3365.46]  invited based
[3365.46 --> 3366.36]  on what station
[3366.36 --> 3367.24]  of life you are
[3367.24 --> 3367.56]  in,
[3367.64 --> 3368.40]  or how put
[3368.40 --> 3369.44]  together your
[3369.44 --> 3370.06]  life appears
[3370.06 --> 3370.52]  to be,
[3370.88 --> 3371.98]  or how accomplished
[3371.98 --> 3373.42]  or unaccomplished
[3373.42 --> 3374.02]  you are.
[3375.06 --> 3375.72]  And what should
[3375.72 --> 3377.16]  shock us most
[3377.16 --> 3378.40]  is not that this
[3378.40 --> 3379.08]  or that person
[3379.08 --> 3379.82]  is at the banquet,
[3379.82 --> 3380.82]  but that you
[3380.82 --> 3381.78]  are at the banquet.
[3383.28 --> 3383.84]  That's what
[3383.84 --> 3384.56]  should shock us.
[3385.94 --> 3386.42]  You know,
[3386.44 --> 3386.96]  it's been said
[3386.96 --> 3387.38]  that when we
[3387.38 --> 3387.92]  get to heaven,
[3388.32 --> 3388.92]  there will be
[3388.92 --> 3390.12]  three surprises.
[3391.36 --> 3392.36]  All the people
[3392.36 --> 3394.06]  who we didn't
[3394.06 --> 3394.56]  think would be
[3394.56 --> 3394.82]  there,
[3395.94 --> 3397.08]  all the people
[3397.08 --> 3397.74]  we thought
[3397.74 --> 3398.36]  would be there
[3398.36 --> 3399.42]  who are not
[3399.42 --> 3399.74]  there,
[3400.78 --> 3401.26]  and that we're
[3401.26 --> 3401.48]  there.
[3404.42 --> 3405.20]  And I love
[3405.20 --> 3405.76]  the fact that
[3405.76 --> 3406.40]  if that is
[3406.40 --> 3406.86]  true,
[3407.76 --> 3408.00]  right,
[3408.00 --> 3408.64]  that Christ
[3408.64 --> 3409.44]  has compelled
[3409.44 --> 3410.34]  all those
[3410.34 --> 3411.34]  whom he wants
[3411.34 --> 3411.80]  to be at
[3411.80 --> 3412.42]  his banquet,
[3413.48 --> 3414.06]  that he wants
[3414.06 --> 3414.50]  to be in
[3414.50 --> 3415.22]  his church,
[3415.54 --> 3416.16]  and he brings
[3416.16 --> 3416.90]  in all sorts
[3416.90 --> 3417.26]  of different
[3417.26 --> 3417.70]  characters,
[3417.98 --> 3418.54]  that means
[3418.54 --> 3419.00]  the church
[3419.00 --> 3419.76]  is the place
[3419.76 --> 3420.42]  of any place
[3420.42 --> 3421.04]  in the world
[3421.04 --> 3421.70]  where you
[3421.70 --> 3422.00]  can be
[3422.00 --> 3422.42]  yourself.
[3423.96 --> 3424.44]  Because
[3424.44 --> 3425.62]  Jesus is
[3425.62 --> 3426.14]  the one
[3426.14 --> 3427.04]  who is happy
[3427.04 --> 3428.12]  to have you
[3428.12 --> 3429.44]  at his banquet.
[3430.28 --> 3431.10]  He wants
[3431.10 --> 3431.54]  you here.
[3431.72 --> 3432.26]  He invited
[3432.26 --> 3432.78]  you here.
[3432.78 --> 3435.20]  Now,
[3435.28 --> 3435.82]  of course,
[3435.98 --> 3436.16]  yeah,
[3436.24 --> 3436.70]  we have to
[3436.70 --> 3437.20]  grow in
[3437.20 --> 3437.96]  grace and
[3437.96 --> 3438.34]  the knowledge
[3438.34 --> 3438.88]  of God.
[3439.04 --> 3439.66]  We come
[3439.66 --> 3440.32]  as we are,
[3440.40 --> 3440.72]  but we don't
[3440.72 --> 3441.58]  stay as we
[3441.58 --> 3441.88]  are.
[3442.66 --> 3443.14]  But at
[3443.14 --> 3443.38]  Jesus'
[3443.64 --> 3444.02]  table,
[3444.20 --> 3444.66]  in his
[3444.66 --> 3445.10]  church,
[3445.22 --> 3445.84]  you can
[3445.84 --> 3446.46]  be yourself
[3446.46 --> 3447.06]  because you
[3447.06 --> 3448.30]  recognize that
[3448.30 --> 3449.12]  Christ has
[3449.12 --> 3449.62]  brought you
[3449.62 --> 3449.94]  here.
[3450.50 --> 3451.38]  It's his
[3451.38 --> 3452.18]  house.
[3452.68 --> 3453.62]  He chose
[3453.62 --> 3454.28]  who would
[3454.28 --> 3454.64]  come.
[3454.94 --> 3455.42]  It's his
[3455.42 --> 3456.20]  guest list.
[3457.72 --> 3457.94]  And so,
[3458.04 --> 3458.16]  friends,
[3458.22 --> 3459.18]  as more and
[3459.18 --> 3459.62]  more people
[3459.62 --> 3460.24]  come into
[3460.24 --> 3460.90]  our church,
[3460.90 --> 3462.46]  what we
[3462.46 --> 3463.28]  can expect
[3463.28 --> 3463.98]  is that
[3463.98 --> 3464.36]  there are
[3464.36 --> 3464.72]  going to
[3464.72 --> 3465.32]  be people
[3465.32 --> 3466.38]  who come
[3466.38 --> 3466.64]  in who
[3466.64 --> 3467.00]  are different
[3467.00 --> 3467.40]  from you.
[3468.28 --> 3468.88]  And that's
[3468.88 --> 3469.08]  a good
[3469.08 --> 3469.34]  thing.
[3470.24 --> 3470.84]  People of
[3470.84 --> 3471.06]  different
[3471.06 --> 3471.80]  ethnicities,
[3472.50 --> 3473.12]  people of
[3473.12 --> 3473.96]  different
[3473.96 --> 3474.84]  personalities,
[3475.94 --> 3476.70]  different ages,
[3477.54 --> 3478.12]  different church
[3478.12 --> 3478.58]  backgrounds,
[3478.80 --> 3478.98]  maybe,
[3479.10 --> 3479.86]  different incomes,
[3480.06 --> 3480.58]  all kinds of
[3480.58 --> 3480.96]  differences,
[3481.30 --> 3481.98]  and that should
[3481.98 --> 3482.82]  relieve you
[3482.82 --> 3483.78]  because you
[3483.78 --> 3484.30]  are here,
[3484.58 --> 3485.14]  and that is
[3485.14 --> 3485.54]  a miracle.
[3487.62 --> 3488.10]  Friends,
[3488.16 --> 3488.56]  it's his
[3488.56 --> 3488.90]  banquet,
[3489.38 --> 3490.02]  it's his
[3490.02 --> 3490.60]  guest list,
[3490.90 --> 3491.66]  and it's
[3491.66 --> 3492.06]  all by
[3492.06 --> 3492.66]  his grace.
[3493.60 --> 3493.96]  And he
[3493.96 --> 3494.32]  gives us
[3494.32 --> 3494.78]  then also
[3494.78 --> 3495.38]  the patience
[3495.38 --> 3495.68]  and the
[3495.68 --> 3495.98]  kindness
[3495.98 --> 3496.32]  and the
[3496.32 --> 3496.64]  love and
[3496.64 --> 3496.90]  all the
[3496.90 --> 3497.16]  graces
[3497.16 --> 3497.58]  that we
[3497.58 --> 3498.76]  need to
[3498.76 --> 3499.22]  love one
[3499.22 --> 3499.66]  another in
[3499.66 --> 3500.18]  the church
[3500.18 --> 3501.12]  and to
[3501.12 --> 3502.50]  sit at
[3502.50 --> 3504.00]  his table.
[3506.18 --> 3506.68]  Let's
[3506.68 --> 3506.88]  pray.
[3511.16 --> 3511.66]  Oh,
[3511.68 --> 3511.82]  Lord,
[3511.88 --> 3512.22]  we thank
[3512.22 --> 3513.18]  you for
[3513.18 --> 3513.96]  your word
[3513.96 --> 3514.68]  and how
[3514.68 --> 3515.58]  amazed we
[3515.58 --> 3515.84]  are,
[3515.92 --> 3516.44]  not that
[3516.44 --> 3517.18]  the person
[3517.18 --> 3518.04]  next to
[3518.04 --> 3519.18]  us or
[3519.18 --> 3519.84]  three rows
[3519.84 --> 3520.40]  ahead or
[3520.40 --> 3520.90]  three rows
[3520.90 --> 3521.52]  behind us
[3521.52 --> 3521.82]  here,
[3522.02 --> 3522.82]  but how
[3522.82 --> 3523.50]  amazed we
[3523.50 --> 3523.84]  are that
[3523.84 --> 3524.16]  we are
[3524.16 --> 3524.42]  here.
[3525.82 --> 3526.50]  We have
[3526.50 --> 3527.22]  disqualified
[3527.22 --> 3528.04]  ourselves
[3528.04 --> 3529.22]  a thousand
[3529.22 --> 3529.94]  times over,
[3530.74 --> 3531.52]  but you
[3531.52 --> 3532.26]  died for
[3532.26 --> 3532.70]  the weak,
[3533.16 --> 3533.96]  for those
[3533.96 --> 3534.18]  who have
[3534.18 --> 3534.74]  nothing in
[3534.74 --> 3535.10]  their hands
[3535.10 --> 3535.50]  to bring,
[3536.60 --> 3537.06]  and so we
[3537.06 --> 3537.88]  cling to the
[3537.88 --> 3538.18]  cross,
[3538.26 --> 3538.84]  we cling to
[3538.84 --> 3539.26]  Christ,
[3539.88 --> 3540.54]  and we ask
[3540.54 --> 3540.80]  that we
[3540.80 --> 3541.14]  would be
[3541.14 --> 3542.56]  refreshed by
[3542.56 --> 3543.50]  his being
[3543.50 --> 3544.50]  happy that
[3544.50 --> 3546.12]  we are in
[3546.12 --> 3546.78]  his kingdom
[3546.78 --> 3547.28]  at his
[3547.28 --> 3547.62]  banquet,
[3547.62 --> 3548.86]  that we
[3548.86 --> 3549.34]  are ready
[3549.34 --> 3550.08]  to taste
[3550.08 --> 3550.50]  and to
[3550.50 --> 3552.30]  feast upon
[3552.30 --> 3552.72]  him and
[3552.72 --> 3553.14]  know that
[3553.14 --> 3553.48]  he is
[3553.48 --> 3554.44]  good forever.
[3555.58 --> 3556.34]  We pray
[3556.34 --> 3557.20]  in Christ's
[3557.20 --> 3557.38]  name.
[3557.92 --> 3558.18]  Amen.
[3561.30 --> 3561.86]  All right,
[3561.92 --> 3562.92]  let's sing
[3562.92 --> 3563.36]  our song of
[3563.36 --> 3563.92]  response.
[3564.06 --> 3564.88]  Please stand
[3564.88 --> 3566.70]  and we'll
[3566.70 --> 3567.28]  sing the song
[3567.28 --> 3568.04]  Gather Us
[3568.04 --> 3568.32]  In,
[3568.42 --> 3569.02]  which I think
[3569.02 --> 3569.70]  connects very
[3569.70 --> 3570.56]  well to
[3570.56 --> 3571.26]  this passage.
[3571.26 --> 3572.06]  Let's sing
[3572.06 --> 3580.48]  a thé federal
[3580.48 --> 3588.80]  song
[3588.80 --> 3590.62]  We
[3590.62 --> 3592.24]  reach this
[3592.24 --> 3593.08]  place
[3593.08 --> 3594.30]  the new light
[3594.30 --> 3595.16]  is storie
[3595.16 --> 3596.26]  Now
[3596.26 --> 3597.00]  is the
[3597.00 --> 3597.94]  darkness
[3597.94 --> 3599.06]  banished
[3599.06 --> 3600.00]  away
[3600.00 --> 3609.86]  See in this space our fears and our dreamings brought here to you in the light of this day.
[3612.92 --> 3617.30]  Gather us in the lost and forsaken.
[3617.82 --> 3621.96]  Gather us in the blind and the lame.
[3621.96 --> 3626.06]  Call to us now and we shall awaken.
[3626.72 --> 3631.60]  We shall arise at the sound of our name.
[3634.66 --> 3638.60]  Here we will take the one in the water.
[3639.24 --> 3643.26]  Here we will take the bread of new earth.
[3643.74 --> 3647.84]  Here you shall call your sons and daughters.
[3647.84 --> 3651.84]  Here we will take the one in the water.
[3655.64 --> 3659.88]  Give us to drink the wine of compassion.
[3660.38 --> 3664.40]  Give us to eat the bread as it is you.
[3664.90 --> 3668.66]  The precious well will teach us to passion.
[3669.32 --> 3673.06]  Lives that are holy and hearts that are true.
[3673.06 --> 3677.06]  Gather us in the hole that's forever.
[3677.06 --> 3681.06]  Not in the dark the buildings and finding.
[3681.06 --> 3685.06]  Not in some heaven that is away.
[3685.82 --> 3689.84]  Here in this place the will of this shining.
[3690.44 --> 3695.06]  Now is the kingdom and now is the day.
[3697.64 --> 3701.88]  Gather us in and hold us forever.
[3701.88 --> 3705.88]  Gather us in and make us alone.
[3706.82 --> 3709.88]  Gather us in, O peoples together.
[3711.28 --> 3714.88]  Fire of love in our flesh and our bone.
[3714.88 --> 3720.22]  May be seated.
[3724.90 --> 3729.30]  Our offering this morning is for our local cadet group.
[3729.78 --> 3733.14]  And I understand that on any given cadet night,
[3733.28 --> 3739.96]  you may see up to 20 plus boys who come from both our church and the community.
[3739.96 --> 3742.96]  So let us support this ministry generously.
[3742.96 --> 3744.96]  God bless you as you do.
[3744.96 --> 3745.96]  Thank you.
[3747.96 --> 3748.96]  Thank you.
[3748.96 --> 3749.96]  Cadets salute the Canadian flag.
[3749.96 --> 3751.96]  Cadets recite your pledge to the flag.
[3751.96 --> 3757.96]  I pledge allegiance to the Canadian flag and the dominion for which it stands,
[3757.96 --> 3761.96]  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[3761.96 --> 3763.96]  Cadets salute the cadet flag.
[3763.96 --> 3765.96]  Cadets recite your pledge.
[3765.96 --> 3777.96]  Thankful to Jehovah for its gifts to me, I pledge myself to be ready to serve God, my parents, my country, my church, my neighbour and my core.
[3777.96 --> 3779.96]  Cadets recite your verse.
[3779.96 --> 3782.96]  If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[3782.96 --> 3784.96]  John 14 verse 15.
[3784.96 --> 3786.96]  Cadets recite your code.
[3786.96 --> 3796.96]  The cadet must be reverent, obedient, compassionate, consecrated, trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious and cheerful.
[3796.96 --> 3798.96]  Cadets recite your motto.
[3798.96 --> 3800.96]  Living for Jesus.
[3800.96 --> 3801.96]  Thank you.
[3801.96 --> 3802.96]  Thank you.
[3831.96 --> 3832.96]  Thanks, Matt.
[3832.96 --> 3833.96]  Will you see the next song?
[3833.96 --> 3835.96]  I'll say 1000ongs of the Missile Book.
[3835.96 --> 3837.96]  Ah, please.
[3837.96 --> 3838.96]  We'll follow you in the St.ion Name League.
[3838.96 --> 3840.96]  We'll be back in a Ochoy journalists.
[3840.96 --> 3841.96]  Bye Bye.
[3841.96 --> 3842.96]  Yeah.
[3842.96 --> 3843.96]  Oh, Bow.
[3843.96 --> 3844.96]  Aung.
[3852.06 --> 3859.96]  And I pledge to come to you at Wizards righteous factawalty,
[3859.96 --> 3889.94]  Thank you.
[3889.96 --> 3919.94]  Thank you.
[3919.96 --> 3949.94]  Thank you.
[3949.96 --> 3979.94]  Thank you.
[3979.96 --> 4009.94]  Thank you.
[4010.52 --> 4013.88]  Just a few things before we go to God in prayer.
[4014.64 --> 4018.34]  Dave has had double knee surgery, which can be very painful.
[4018.50 --> 4021.30]  Gina thinks she will be picking him up today from hospital.
[4021.54 --> 4022.72]  He had that done on Thursday.
[4023.38 --> 4027.20]  Usually a lot of pain associated with that, so we'll be praying for Dave.
[4027.20 --> 4037.98]  And Asifah has not been well for a number of weeks with not a conclusive diagnosis, so we will be praying for her as well.
[4037.98 --> 4067.96]  Let's come to God in prayer.
[4067.98 --> 4077.82]  You walk with us both in our joy, our excitement, our passion, our anxiety, our loneliness, and our sorrow.
[4077.82 --> 4080.86]  You are our rock and redeemer.
[4080.86 --> 4085.40]  As we approach you in prayer, we hear you say to your disciples,
[4085.40 --> 4086.40]  Be of good courage.
[4086.40 --> 4087.40]  Be of good courage.
[4087.40 --> 4088.78]  I have overcome the world.
[4088.78 --> 4098.08]  Lord, you are the Lord of the nations, even when those nations seem to be falling apart as a result of injustice, conflict, and disaster.
[4098.08 --> 4106.50]  Lord, we wait eagerly for you to restore peace among the nations, and that your return will be soon.
[4107.50 --> 4113.22]  Will you bring hope to the areas ravaged by war, especially the Ukraine and Gaza?
[4113.22 --> 4121.22]  We pray for children who have been left orphans and all who have witnessed these unspeakable atrocities firsthand.
[4122.22 --> 4126.12]  Give strength to those who attend to bring aid to the suffering.
[4126.12 --> 4135.12]  We pray that those who flee may find peaceful refuge, and we thank you for those who help them in this exhausting, never-ending task.
[4136.50 --> 4151.38]  Lord, it's easy to become complacent about all the issues in our own country—homelessness, mental illness, the housing crisis, drug deaths, and heart-rending statistics of our country's rise in medically-assisted deaths.
[4151.38 --> 4155.86]  Show each of us what we can do to help address these wounds.
[4156.82 --> 4163.00]  Give us passion for your kingdom to come here on earth, to do your will here as it is done in heaven.
[4164.24 --> 4167.50]  Take away our excuses for complacency, Lord.
[4168.84 --> 4176.02]  We pray strength for your church worldwide, that she may work as one to bring Christ's grace and peace.
[4176.66 --> 4181.18]  Forgive and heal petty divisions and immerse her in your life-giving water.
[4182.24 --> 4185.26]  Give courage and strength to those persecuted for Christ.
[4186.46 --> 4188.12]  We lift up to you this church.
[4188.98 --> 4193.68]  Give us spiritual maturity and weapons to fight against Satan's subtle schemes.
[4194.34 --> 4200.84]  Keep our eyes firmly fixed on you and your commands, that we may love you above all and the other as we love ourselves.
[4201.76 --> 4206.82]  Thank you for pastors Jason and Nancy, and for our church council.
[4207.66 --> 4209.64]  Continue to strengthen them with your wisdom.
[4209.64 --> 4212.34]  Thank you for all the willing volunteers.
[4213.24 --> 4216.12]  We know that whatever is done in love pleases you.
[4217.06 --> 4220.80]  Thank you for our cadet program and that we can support this program.
[4220.80 --> 4229.86]  Thank you for their leaders, especially Doug, who has worked so hard for so many years to bring your story to the boys who attend.
[4230.82 --> 4235.74]  May your story permeate their hearts that they too would know you as their rock and redeemer.
[4235.74 --> 4240.72]  Great physician, we bring you those who have ongoing health issues.
[4241.36 --> 4243.02]  We ask healing for each one.
[4244.02 --> 4248.06]  Restore Annette, whose struggle has been long and tedious and ongoing.
[4248.92 --> 4252.26]  Lay your healing hand on those who are in treatment for cancer.
[4253.06 --> 4257.52]  May treatments be effective and strengthen their caregivers at home and in the clinical setting.
[4257.52 --> 4262.76]  Thank you for Dave's successful double knee replacement surgery this week.
[4263.32 --> 4267.16]  May his recovery be surprisingly swift with minimal pain.
[4267.90 --> 4270.94]  We ask your care for a Sif away who has not been well.
[4271.78 --> 4274.88]  May she receive an accurate diagnosis with effective treatment.
[4274.88 --> 4282.42]  Lord, comfort the sorrowing, especially Jerry, Wayne and Jeanette and the extended family in the loss of Ann.
[4283.18 --> 4284.92]  Thank you for her life.
[4285.96 --> 4292.34]  Comfort others who have had recent and not so recent losses that are still so raw and hard.
[4293.32 --> 4295.36]  Give us sensitivity to their pain.
[4296.32 --> 4302.10]  We thank you for hearing our prayers of the past, for healing Angela and a continuing measure of healing for Tony.
[4302.10 --> 4306.38]  Thank you for other graces you have provided to us on our journey.
[4307.20 --> 4311.24]  Give us eyes to see your goodness and everyday miracles and mercy.
[4312.10 --> 4315.82]  Go with us on our way as we are renewed in your love and grace.
[4316.70 --> 4320.20]  May we walk with you this week attentive to your spirit's voice within.
[4321.14 --> 4322.60]  May our love increase.
[4323.42 --> 4326.54]  We pray it in the name of Jesus, our beautiful Lord and Savior.
[4327.22 --> 4327.48]  Amen.
[4327.48 --> 4337.88]  And as Pastor Jason comes up to give us our blessing this morning, just a reminder that we are having soup together.
[4338.10 --> 4340.86]  So you are invited to the feast of soup.
[4341.56 --> 4343.78]  And before that, there will be coffee.
[4343.88 --> 4346.66]  But instead of it being in the fellowship hall, it will be here in the foyer.
[4346.66 --> 4347.66]  Thank you.
[4356.02 --> 4357.58]  Please rise for the benediction.
[4358.88 --> 4361.72]  And also we'll sing a final song afterward.
[4364.62 --> 4367.84]  So this blessing comes from Ephesians chapter 3.
[4368.18 --> 4371.68]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4371.68 --> 4380.88]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
[4381.48 --> 4387.88]  to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever.
[4388.36 --> 4388.60]  Amen.
[4388.60 --> 4388.66]  Amen.
[4401.68 --> 4419.58]  Amen.
[4419.58 --> 4420.58]  Amen.
[4420.58 --> 4426.76]  Amen.
[4426.76 --> 4428.98]  Amen.
[4428.98 --> 4430.70]  Amen.
