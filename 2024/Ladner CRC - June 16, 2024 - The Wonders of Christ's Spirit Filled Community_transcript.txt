[3237.02 --> 3267.02]  Thank you.
[3267.02 --> 3269.02]  You can become part of you.
[3297.02 --> 3298.02]  for all.
[3327.02 --> 3357.00]  He says,
[3357.02 --> 3358.02]  world.
[3387.02 --> 3417.02]  and everyone
[3417.02 --> 3419.10]  growing community.
[3420.14 --> 3420.74]  And
[3420.74 --> 3423.42]  you can just imagine
[3423.42 --> 3424.70]  the excitement.
[3428.78 --> 3430.94]  The Son of God has come
[3430.94 --> 3433.42]  and has
[3433.42 --> 3435.18]  resurrected
[3435.18 --> 3435.82]  himself
[3435.82 --> 3439.24]  and has invited us to be
[3439.24 --> 3440.54]  part of his family
[3440.54 --> 3443.16]  and everybody wants to be
[3443.16 --> 3444.32]  part of that family now.
[3445.48 --> 3446.66]  And there is
[3446.66 --> 3448.10]  such excitement
[3448.10 --> 3451.28]  that people are willing
[3451.28 --> 3453.22]  to give anything.
[3453.46 --> 3455.42]  Not to pay
[3455.42 --> 3457.26]  for to join this, but
[3457.26 --> 3459.28]  having joined this, they have no
[3459.28 --> 3460.20]  more worries.
[3461.74 --> 3463.26]  So many of our
[3463.26 --> 3465.62]  worries are about survival.
[3466.30 --> 3467.74]  Our survival,
[3468.60 --> 3469.78]  our children's
[3469.78 --> 3470.28]  survival,
[3471.30 --> 3473.34]  making sure that
[3473.34 --> 3475.32]  the things that we own are cared
[3475.32 --> 3476.06]  for and
[3476.06 --> 3478.98]  maintained and managed,
[3479.94 --> 3481.34]  we're so
[3481.34 --> 3483.28]  focused on
[3483.28 --> 3485.92]  making sure that we make it
[3485.92 --> 3488.06]  that we accumulate
[3488.06 --> 3488.98]  possessions
[3488.98 --> 3490.12]  and
[3490.12 --> 3492.88]  we're not as
[3492.88 --> 3494.88]  invested in taking care of everyone
[3494.88 --> 3495.76]  else around us.
[3495.80 --> 3496.66]  That's a normal,
[3497.08 --> 3497.98]  natural thing.
[3497.98 --> 3500.98]  what we see in this picture
[3500.98 --> 3502.12]  that we're about to read
[3502.12 --> 3503.76]  is almost,
[3503.90 --> 3505.00]  it's supernatural.
[3506.24 --> 3506.56]  It's
[3506.56 --> 3509.76]  it's something that
[3509.76 --> 3511.14]  has never,
[3511.14 --> 3512.60]  had never been seen before
[3512.60 --> 3514.04]  and hasn't been seen since.
[3514.10 --> 3514.50]  You might
[3514.50 --> 3516.70]  think this looks a little bit
[3516.70 --> 3517.86]  like something you've seen,
[3517.86 --> 3520.00]  but if you start to look at
[3520.00 --> 3521.60]  thousands of people
[3521.60 --> 3523.80]  together
[3523.80 --> 3525.74]  doing what we read here,
[3526.18 --> 3528.02]  you realize this is
[3528.02 --> 3528.74]  unique.
[3529.60 --> 3531.18]  They devoted themselves
[3531.18 --> 3532.20]  to the apostles
[3532.20 --> 3533.74]  teaching and to,
[3534.32 --> 3535.40]  so we've just talked about
[3535.40 --> 3536.32]  the apostles teaching,
[3537.02 --> 3538.34]  those things that they
[3538.34 --> 3539.54]  understood
[3539.54 --> 3540.82]  and were making sure
[3540.82 --> 3541.80]  other people understood
[3541.80 --> 3543.82]  that they were part of a new family.
[3543.82 --> 3546.90]  to the fellowship,
[3547.50 --> 3549.40]  to the breaking of bread
[3549.40 --> 3550.22]  and to prayer,
[3550.64 --> 3552.54]  everyone was filled with awe
[3552.54 --> 3554.08]  and many wonders
[3554.08 --> 3555.46]  and miraculous signs
[3555.46 --> 3556.82]  were done by the apostles.
[3557.56 --> 3559.06]  All the believers were together
[3559.06 --> 3560.64]  and had everything in common.
[3562.98 --> 3564.12]  Did you catch that?
[3565.38 --> 3566.96]  Selling their possessions
[3566.96 --> 3567.62]  and goods
[3567.62 --> 3569.04]  they gave to anyone
[3569.04 --> 3570.32]  as he had need.
[3572.82 --> 3573.78]  Every day,
[3573.82 --> 3574.82]  they continued
[3574.82 --> 3576.50]  to meet together
[3576.50 --> 3577.66]  in the temple courts.
[3578.52 --> 3579.30]  They broke bread
[3579.30 --> 3579.98]  in their homes
[3579.98 --> 3580.98]  and ate together
[3580.98 --> 3581.86]  with glad
[3581.86 --> 3583.16]  and sincere hearts,
[3583.80 --> 3584.60]  praising God
[3584.60 --> 3585.62]  and enjoying
[3585.62 --> 3586.26]  the favor
[3586.26 --> 3587.24]  of all the people
[3587.24 --> 3588.46]  and the Lord
[3588.46 --> 3589.64]  added to their number
[3589.64 --> 3590.18]  daily
[3590.18 --> 3592.38]  those who were being saved.
[3597.28 --> 3600.08]  This is a remarkable picture.
[3601.64 --> 3602.96]  People are
[3602.96 --> 3603.96]  giving
[3603.96 --> 3606.34]  everything they have
[3606.34 --> 3607.84]  for the community.
[3609.84 --> 3611.48]  They're spending time
[3611.48 --> 3612.82]  getting to know each other.
[3613.18 --> 3613.72]  They spent
[3613.72 --> 3615.14]  much time together
[3615.14 --> 3615.96]  and
[3615.96 --> 3617.96]  they
[3617.96 --> 3620.04]  shared their food.
[3620.24 --> 3620.76]  They shared
[3620.76 --> 3621.84]  they were
[3621.84 --> 3622.76]  constantly
[3622.76 --> 3625.34]  creating new opportunities
[3625.34 --> 3626.54]  to break down
[3626.54 --> 3627.16]  the barriers
[3627.16 --> 3627.96]  between them.
[3627.96 --> 3629.62]  Socio-economic barriers,
[3629.82 --> 3630.58]  cultural barriers.
[3630.58 --> 3631.30]  We know
[3631.30 --> 3631.62]  there were
[3631.62 --> 3632.36]  many people
[3632.36 --> 3633.26]  of different cultures
[3633.26 --> 3634.22]  and languages here.
[3634.46 --> 3635.16]  They were
[3635.16 --> 3636.08]  constantly
[3636.08 --> 3637.66]  overcoming
[3637.66 --> 3639.50]  and transforming
[3639.50 --> 3640.78]  moving from
[3640.78 --> 3642.32]  a divided
[3642.32 --> 3642.90]  even though
[3642.90 --> 3643.40]  there's this
[3643.40 --> 3644.48]  collective sense
[3644.48 --> 3645.08]  to humanity
[3645.08 --> 3645.70]  there's also
[3645.70 --> 3646.94]  a dividedness
[3646.94 --> 3647.76]  within humanity
[3647.76 --> 3648.22]  isn't there?
[3649.36 --> 3650.66]  But they realized
[3650.66 --> 3653.60]  we are no longer
[3653.60 --> 3654.68]  part of this.
[3655.02 --> 3656.00]  We're human
[3656.00 --> 3657.16]  but we are now
[3657.16 --> 3658.14]  adopted
[3658.14 --> 3659.74]  into God's family
[3659.74 --> 3661.14]  and we can
[3661.14 --> 3662.18]  conduct ourselves
[3662.18 --> 3663.38]  in a different way
[3663.38 --> 3664.38]  knowing
[3664.38 --> 3665.80]  that Jesus
[3665.80 --> 3666.86]  is coming back.
[3669.00 --> 3670.76]  These are the first weeks
[3670.76 --> 3672.88]  after Jesus
[3672.88 --> 3674.16]  left
[3674.16 --> 3675.92]  and there was a sense
[3675.92 --> 3676.76]  people thought
[3676.76 --> 3678.18]  he's coming
[3678.18 --> 3679.02]  right back.
[3679.02 --> 3682.70]  it's been
[3682.70 --> 3684.30]  2,000 years
[3684.30 --> 3684.90]  now.
[3689.12 --> 3690.12]  It's hard
[3690.12 --> 3691.46]  to read this text
[3691.46 --> 3691.98]  and think
[3691.98 --> 3692.64]  it's relevant
[3692.64 --> 3694.16]  because
[3694.16 --> 3695.64]  while maybe
[3695.64 --> 3696.56]  this was true
[3696.56 --> 3699.40]  and you might
[3699.40 --> 3700.04]  look at them
[3700.04 --> 3700.44]  and say
[3700.44 --> 3701.72]  it probably
[3701.72 --> 3702.88]  wasn't as crazy
[3702.88 --> 3704.40]  looking to them
[3704.40 --> 3705.12]  because they
[3705.12 --> 3705.84]  really thought
[3705.84 --> 3706.78]  Jesus was coming
[3706.78 --> 3707.36]  right back.
[3707.36 --> 3710.00]  but for us
[3710.00 --> 3711.60]  this is just
[3711.60 --> 3712.38]  not realistic.
[3714.64 --> 3715.56]  We're waiting
[3715.56 --> 3716.06]  and we've been
[3716.06 --> 3717.08]  waiting a long time
[3717.08 --> 3720.08]  and
[3720.08 --> 3721.56]  people aren't
[3721.56 --> 3722.32]  just coming
[3722.32 --> 3723.46]  and getting
[3723.46 --> 3724.18]  added to our
[3724.18 --> 3724.82]  number daily.
[3725.26 --> 3726.12]  The exponential
[3726.12 --> 3726.88]  growth rate
[3726.88 --> 3728.06]  it started to
[3728.06 --> 3728.38]  plateau
[3728.38 --> 3729.26]  after a while.
[3732.16 --> 3732.94]  Those are the
[3732.94 --> 3733.44]  kinds of things
[3733.44 --> 3733.76]  I think
[3733.76 --> 3735.12]  most of us
[3735.12 --> 3735.94]  as we read
[3735.94 --> 3736.88]  these words
[3736.88 --> 3737.88]  we probably
[3737.88 --> 3738.34]  think
[3738.34 --> 3739.30]  and even
[3739.30 --> 3739.68]  if you
[3739.68 --> 3740.18]  continue
[3740.18 --> 3740.76]  reading in
[3740.76 --> 3741.18]  Acts
[3741.18 --> 3742.08]  you realize
[3742.08 --> 3742.48]  although
[3742.48 --> 3742.94]  there's
[3742.94 --> 3743.82]  keeping on
[3743.82 --> 3744.62]  more signs
[3744.62 --> 3745.10]  and wonders
[3745.10 --> 3746.40]  and more
[3746.40 --> 3746.98]  growth
[3746.98 --> 3750.18]  as there
[3750.18 --> 3750.80]  was growth
[3750.80 --> 3751.58]  they had to
[3751.58 --> 3752.30]  start to
[3752.30 --> 3753.08]  like adjust
[3753.08 --> 3754.86]  so we
[3754.86 --> 3755.08]  installed
[3755.08 --> 3755.22]  so we just
[3755.22 --> 3756.18]  installed
[3756.18 --> 3757.16]  some new
[3757.16 --> 3757.68]  elders
[3757.68 --> 3758.26]  and deacons
[3758.26 --> 3758.48]  and
[3758.48 --> 3759.10]  you know
[3759.10 --> 3760.66]  by chapter 6
[3760.66 --> 3761.54]  in Acts
[3761.54 --> 3762.30]  we hear about
[3762.30 --> 3762.98]  they had to
[3762.98 --> 3763.66]  bring in
[3763.66 --> 3764.82]  some new people
[3764.82 --> 3765.66]  and they had to
[3765.66 --> 3766.28]  divide up
[3766.28 --> 3767.20]  the responsibilities
[3767.20 --> 3768.66]  the apostles
[3768.66 --> 3769.26]  couldn't do
[3769.26 --> 3770.06]  everything anymore
[3770.06 --> 3770.52]  and
[3770.52 --> 3772.14]  now they
[3772.14 --> 3773.22]  had to focus
[3773.22 --> 3773.98]  only on some
[3773.98 --> 3774.26]  things
[3774.26 --> 3774.88]  and the deacons
[3774.88 --> 3775.44]  had to do
[3775.44 --> 3776.48]  more of the
[3776.48 --> 3777.06]  other things
[3777.06 --> 3777.48]  and
[3777.48 --> 3779.38]  there's like
[3779.38 --> 3780.38]  a change
[3780.38 --> 3781.04]  there's changing
[3781.04 --> 3781.48]  happening
[3781.48 --> 3782.02]  and
[3782.02 --> 3783.12]  one of the
[3783.12 --> 3783.76]  first things
[3783.76 --> 3784.16]  we hear
[3784.16 --> 3784.96]  when we hear
[3784.96 --> 3785.66]  about Stephen
[3785.66 --> 3787.20]  is that
[3787.20 --> 3788.18]  he faced
[3788.18 --> 3788.84]  opposition
[3788.84 --> 3791.38]  the
[3791.38 --> 3792.24]  the other
[3792.24 --> 3792.94]  Jews
[3792.94 --> 3794.08]  argued with him
[3794.08 --> 3794.80]  and he argued
[3794.80 --> 3795.22]  back
[3795.22 --> 3795.98]  and he got
[3795.98 --> 3796.38]  killed
[3796.38 --> 3798.42]  he was the
[3798.42 --> 3799.38]  first to die
[3799.38 --> 3800.68]  and then there
[3800.68 --> 3801.14]  were many
[3801.14 --> 3801.78]  that died
[3801.78 --> 3805.26]  by the end
[3805.26 --> 3805.74]  of Acts
[3805.74 --> 3807.18]  there's still
[3807.18 --> 3808.36]  this debate
[3808.36 --> 3809.12]  argument
[3809.12 --> 3810.78]  Paul spends
[3810.78 --> 3812.26]  all day long
[3812.26 --> 3813.02]  trying to talk
[3813.02 --> 3813.62]  to the Jews
[3813.62 --> 3814.06]  in Rome
[3814.06 --> 3816.04]  and he's not
[3816.04 --> 3816.60]  getting anywhere
[3816.60 --> 3817.34]  only a few
[3817.34 --> 3817.60]  of them
[3817.60 --> 3817.94]  believed
[3817.94 --> 3818.80]  most of them
[3818.80 --> 3819.90]  disagreed
[3819.90 --> 3820.60]  and they just
[3820.60 --> 3821.14]  walked out
[3821.14 --> 3821.74]  after he was
[3821.74 --> 3822.28]  done talking
[3822.28 --> 3824.22]  but he
[3824.22 --> 3824.42]  would
[3824.42 --> 3824.68]  he
[3824.68 --> 3827.82]  found
[3827.82 --> 3828.50]  accommodation
[3828.50 --> 3829.18]  and out of
[3829.18 --> 3829.50]  his own
[3829.50 --> 3829.78]  money
[3829.78 --> 3830.50]  he paid
[3830.50 --> 3831.54]  to stay
[3831.54 --> 3831.80]  there
[3831.80 --> 3832.34]  for a couple
[3832.34 --> 3832.76]  of years
[3832.76 --> 3833.52]  just so that
[3833.52 --> 3833.82]  he could
[3833.82 --> 3834.38]  keep talking
[3834.38 --> 3834.88]  with people
[3834.88 --> 3836.10]  and hosting
[3836.10 --> 3836.64]  people in
[3836.64 --> 3836.98]  his home
[3836.98 --> 3838.72]  that's how
[3838.72 --> 3839.44]  the book
[3839.44 --> 3839.92]  ends
[3839.92 --> 3842.04]  it's
[3842.04 --> 3843.10]  it's not
[3843.10 --> 3844.04]  like this
[3844.04 --> 3844.50]  anymore
[3844.50 --> 3847.08]  so what
[3847.08 --> 3847.70]  what can we
[3847.70 --> 3848.18]  take from
[3848.18 --> 3848.58]  this
[3848.58 --> 3849.42]  what do we
[3849.42 --> 3849.92]  take from
[3849.92 --> 3850.90]  a picture
[3850.90 --> 3852.18]  where
[3852.18 --> 3853.34]  people are
[3853.34 --> 3854.32]  engaged in
[3854.32 --> 3855.86]  giving everything
[3855.86 --> 3857.06]  they're constantly
[3857.06 --> 3857.68]  in fellowship
[3857.68 --> 3858.12]  they're
[3858.12 --> 3859.52]  they're hungry
[3859.52 --> 3860.28]  to learn
[3860.28 --> 3861.12]  and to really
[3861.12 --> 3861.70]  understand
[3861.70 --> 3862.62]  who they are
[3862.62 --> 3863.56]  in God's
[3863.56 --> 3863.90]  family
[3863.90 --> 3865.26]  they're
[3865.26 --> 3866.58]  constantly
[3866.58 --> 3867.34]  in prayer
[3867.34 --> 3868.44]  praise
[3868.44 --> 3869.94]  and they
[3869.94 --> 3870.28]  have
[3870.28 --> 3870.78]  the
[3870.78 --> 3871.18]  favor
[3871.18 --> 3871.64]  of the
[3871.64 --> 3871.94]  people
[3871.94 --> 3875.88]  I think
[3875.88 --> 3876.34]  that
[3876.34 --> 3878.36]  so I
[3878.36 --> 3878.80]  entitled
[3878.80 --> 3879.60]  my message
[3879.60 --> 3881.70]  the wonders
[3881.70 --> 3883.56]  of Christ's
[3883.56 --> 3884.60]  spirit-filled
[3884.60 --> 3885.28]  community
[3885.28 --> 3886.98]  I had a
[3886.98 --> 3887.50]  much longer
[3887.50 --> 3887.80]  title
[3887.80 --> 3888.46]  I actually
[3888.46 --> 3888.90]  cut it
[3888.90 --> 3889.30]  down to
[3889.30 --> 3889.58]  that
[3889.58 --> 3890.24]  but
[3890.24 --> 3891.16]  the
[3891.16 --> 3892.42]  thing
[3892.42 --> 3892.76]  that I
[3892.76 --> 3893.24]  see here
[3893.24 --> 3893.56]  these
[3893.56 --> 3893.80]  are
[3893.80 --> 3894.48]  in some
[3894.48 --> 3894.88]  way
[3894.88 --> 3896.32]  supernatural
[3896.32 --> 3898.58]  characteristics
[3898.58 --> 3899.02]  of a
[3899.02 --> 3899.42]  community
[3899.42 --> 3900.00]  they
[3900.00 --> 3900.60]  are
[3900.60 --> 3901.28]  wonders
[3901.28 --> 3902.56]  and
[3902.56 --> 3904.10]  they're
[3904.10 --> 3904.50]  also
[3904.50 --> 3905.32]  ordinary
[3905.32 --> 3906.28]  they're
[3906.28 --> 3906.82]  very
[3906.82 --> 3908.04]  concrete
[3908.04 --> 3908.42]  things
[3908.42 --> 3908.72]  that we
[3908.72 --> 3909.16]  can still
[3909.16 --> 3909.46]  do
[3909.46 --> 3910.20]  and we
[3910.20 --> 3910.40]  do
[3910.40 --> 3910.70]  still
[3910.70 --> 3910.94]  do
[3910.94 --> 3912.04]  like
[3912.04 --> 3912.18]  I
[3912.18 --> 3912.38]  look
[3912.38 --> 3912.74]  at my
[3912.74 --> 3913.20]  community
[3913.20 --> 3913.64]  in
[3913.64 --> 3914.40]  Egypt
[3914.40 --> 3914.84]  and
[3914.84 --> 3915.32]  many
[3915.32 --> 3915.50]  of
[3915.50 --> 3915.70]  these
[3915.70 --> 3916.14]  things
[3916.14 --> 3917.26]  giving
[3917.26 --> 3917.62]  what
[3917.62 --> 3917.82]  we
[3917.82 --> 3918.24]  can
[3918.24 --> 3919.58]  gathering
[3919.58 --> 3920.30]  regularly
[3920.30 --> 3922.32]  we
[3922.32 --> 3922.58]  have
[3922.58 --> 3923.08]  some
[3923.08 --> 3923.94]  amazing
[3923.94 --> 3924.34]  times
[3924.34 --> 3924.50]  of
[3924.50 --> 3924.86]  fellowship
[3924.86 --> 3925.18]  and
[3925.18 --> 3925.54]  prayer
[3925.54 --> 3926.58]  we
[3926.58 --> 3926.86]  eat
[3926.86 --> 3927.36]  together
[3927.36 --> 3928.96]  I'm
[3928.96 --> 3929.16]  sure
[3929.16 --> 3929.32]  you
[3929.32 --> 3929.46]  do
[3929.46 --> 3929.64]  the
[3929.64 --> 3929.80]  same
[3929.80 --> 3930.12]  thing
[3930.12 --> 3930.56]  churches
[3930.56 --> 3930.90]  around
[3930.90 --> 3931.08]  the
[3931.08 --> 3931.30]  world
[3931.30 --> 3931.50]  are
[3931.50 --> 3931.72]  doing
[3931.72 --> 3931.98]  these
[3931.98 --> 3932.38]  things
[3932.38 --> 3934.80]  and
[3934.80 --> 3935.82]  doing
[3935.82 --> 3936.20]  them
[3936.20 --> 3937.68]  consistently
[3937.68 --> 3942.90]  what's
[3942.90 --> 3943.42]  important
[3943.42 --> 3943.88]  is that
[3943.88 --> 3944.04]  we
[3944.04 --> 3944.68]  recognize
[3944.68 --> 3944.98]  that
[3944.98 --> 3945.38]  this
[3945.38 --> 3947.28]  when
[3947.28 --> 3947.78]  others
[3947.78 --> 3948.26]  are able
[3948.26 --> 3948.84]  to come
[3948.84 --> 3949.16]  in
[3949.16 --> 3949.62]  and see
[3949.62 --> 3949.94]  it
[3949.94 --> 3951.22]  it
[3951.22 --> 3951.76]  does
[3951.76 --> 3953.12]  kind
[3953.12 --> 3953.30]  of
[3953.30 --> 3954.16]  create
[3954.16 --> 3954.42]  a
[3954.42 --> 3954.80]  longing
[3954.80 --> 3955.10]  in
[3955.10 --> 3955.34]  them
[3955.34 --> 3957.62]  it
[3957.62 --> 3958.64]  creates
[3958.64 --> 3959.10]  a
[3959.10 --> 3959.58]  recognition
[3959.58 --> 3960.08]  if it's
[3960.08 --> 3960.48]  really
[3960.48 --> 3960.80]  done
[3960.80 --> 3961.06]  with
[3961.06 --> 3961.82]  integrity
[3961.82 --> 3962.94]  with
[3962.94 --> 3964.06]  sincerity
[3964.06 --> 3965.56]  that's
[3965.56 --> 3965.80]  one of
[3965.80 --> 3966.20]  the words
[3966.20 --> 3966.56]  in this
[3966.56 --> 3967.14]  text
[3967.14 --> 3968.68]  people
[3968.68 --> 3969.46]  see it
[3969.46 --> 3970.14]  and they
[3970.14 --> 3970.88]  feel like
[3970.88 --> 3972.00]  we really
[3972.00 --> 3972.42]  are
[3972.42 --> 3973.24]  part of
[3973.24 --> 3973.96]  some
[3973.96 --> 3974.42]  kind
[3974.42 --> 3974.64]  of
[3974.64 --> 3975.24]  a
[3975.24 --> 3975.56]  special
[3975.56 --> 3976.04]  family
[3976.04 --> 3977.64]  and
[3977.64 --> 3978.04]  the more
[3978.04 --> 3978.64]  diverse
[3978.64 --> 3979.12]  our
[3979.12 --> 3980.40]  communities
[3980.40 --> 3980.86]  are
[3980.86 --> 3982.12]  the more
[3982.12 --> 3982.68]  special
[3982.68 --> 3983.32]  that family
[3983.32 --> 3983.68]  is
[3983.68 --> 3984.04]  because
[3984.04 --> 3984.80]  it's
[3984.80 --> 3985.16]  very
[3985.16 --> 3985.66]  clear
[3985.66 --> 3986.50]  we're
[3986.50 --> 3986.78]  not
[3986.78 --> 3987.20]  we're
[3987.20 --> 3987.68]  we're
[3987.68 --> 3988.64]  we're
[3988.64 --> 3989.52]  crossing
[3989.52 --> 3992.54]  we're
[3992.54 --> 3993.32]  bridging
[3993.32 --> 3993.84]  barriers
[3993.84 --> 3994.26]  we're
[3994.26 --> 3994.88]  bringing
[3994.88 --> 3995.34]  people
[3995.34 --> 3995.78]  together
[3995.78 --> 3996.74]  nothing
[3996.74 --> 3997.32]  divides
[3997.32 --> 3997.54]  us
[3997.54 --> 3997.86]  anymore
[3997.86 --> 3999.32]  so
[3999.32 --> 3999.34]  so
[3999.34 --> 4000.78]  we
[4000.78 --> 4001.30]  experience
[4001.30 --> 4001.62]  we have
[4001.62 --> 4001.90]  something
[4001.90 --> 4002.28]  called
[4002.28 --> 4002.70]  Cairo
[4002.70 --> 4003.24]  community
[4003.24 --> 4004.58]  we
[4004.58 --> 4004.82]  we
[4004.82 --> 4005.04]  meet
[4005.04 --> 4005.26]  this
[4005.26 --> 4005.38]  is
[4005.38 --> 4005.60]  not
[4005.60 --> 4006.12]  church
[4006.12 --> 4006.84]  but we
[4006.84 --> 4007.02]  meet
[4007.02 --> 4007.38]  together
[4007.38 --> 4007.76]  a couple
[4007.76 --> 4007.92]  of
[4007.92 --> 4008.16]  times
[4008.16 --> 4008.60]  a month
[4008.60 --> 4009.32]  and
[4009.32 --> 4009.98]  we
[4009.98 --> 4011.28]  in some
[4011.28 --> 4011.48]  way
[4011.48 --> 4011.66]  we
[4011.66 --> 4011.96]  follow
[4011.96 --> 4012.24]  this
[4012.24 --> 4012.60]  picture
[4012.60 --> 4013.20]  we
[4013.20 --> 4013.76]  we
[4013.76 --> 4014.14]  learn
[4014.14 --> 4014.40]  we
[4014.40 --> 4014.76]  pray
[4014.76 --> 4014.98]  we
[4014.98 --> 4015.36]  sing
[4015.36 --> 4016.32]  we
[4016.32 --> 4017.58]  we
[4017.58 --> 4017.82]  spend
[4017.82 --> 4018.28]  time
[4018.28 --> 4019.14]  in
[4019.14 --> 4019.48]  fellowship

[4245.04 --> 4245.38]  is
[4245.38 --> 4246.12]  echoing
[4246.12 --> 4246.40]  into
[4246.40 --> 4246.60]  the
[4246.60 --> 4246.96]  present
[4246.96 --> 4247.70]  that

[4248.70 --> 4249.28]  is
[4249.28 --> 4250.40]  imminently
[4250.40 --> 4251.86]  close
[4251.86 --> 4252.26]  he's
[4252.26 --> 4252.78]  coming
[4252.78 --> 4253.28]  back

[4260.48 --> 4263.60]  so
[4263.60 --> 4263.72]  I
[4263.72 --> 4263.86]  think
[4263.86 --> 4264.12]  what

[4270.92 --> 4271.06]  we
[4271.06 --> 4271.42]  sang
[4271.42 --> 4272.68]  needs
[4272.68 --> 4272.92]  to
[4272.92 --> 4273.32]  be
[4273.32 --> 4274.04]  the

[4276.32 --> 4276.86]  ourselves
[4276.86 --> 4277.20]  of
[4277.20 --> 4277.62]  all
[4277.62 --> 4277.78]  the
[4277.78 --> 4278.06]  time
[4278.06 --> 4282.60]  we
[4282.60 --> 4283.04]  need

[4287.26 --> 4287.46]  the
[4287.46 --> 4287.82]  future
[4287.82 --> 4288.76]  this
[4288.76 --> 4288.88]  is
[4288.88 --> 4289.02]  a
[4289.02 --> 4289.28]  picture
[4289.28 --> 4289.50]  of

[4293.68 --> 4294.14]  closer
[4294.14 --> 4295.16]  imminently
[4295.16 --> 4295.52]  close
[4295.52 --> 4295.72]  it's
[4295.72 --> 4296.22]  about
[4296.22 --> 4296.42]  to
[4296.42 --> 4296.76]  happen
[4296.76 --> 4298.02]  when

[4298.20 --> 4298.36]  do
[4298.36 --> 4298.76]  this
[4298.76 --> 4301.14]  it
[4301.14 --> 4301.84]  produces
[4301.84 --> 4303.04]  a

[4307.70 --> 4308.52]  in
[4308.52 --> 4308.70]  all
[4308.70 --> 4308.82]  of
[4308.82 --> 4308.98]  these
[4308.98 --> 4309.18]  other
[4309.18 --> 4309.54]  ways
[4309.54 --> 4310.72]  these

[5046.88 --> 5076.86]  Thank you.
[5076.88 --> 5078.88]  Thank you.
[5078.88 --> 5081.88]  Hi.
[5082.88 --> 5083.46]  Hi.
[5083.88 --> 5091.24]  You know, I pictured some music in the background, but I actually feel like talking in the background
[5091.24 --> 5095.10]  would have been more appropriate, but there's no way to go through all of those.
[5095.10 --> 5101.04]  It makes me think maybe I have to send a newsletter just of all those photos and all kinds of
[5101.04 --> 5102.54]  little blurbs to explain.
[5103.10 --> 5106.34]  Because for me, it brings back so many memories.
[5107.92 --> 5108.68]  Anyway, go ahead.
[5108.68 --> 5109.68]  Yeah.
[5109.68 --> 5110.68]  Yeah.
[5110.68 --> 5111.68]  Yeah.
[5111.68 --> 5112.62]  So those, I think those photos were beautiful, many of them beautiful.
[5112.62 --> 5114.62]  I think we saw the Banstras in there a couple times.
[5114.62 --> 5119.82]  And they give just a sense of the atmosphere, the environment, the community that Najee and
[5119.82 --> 5121.62]  his wife and family are part of.
[5121.62 --> 5126.56]  So we're just going to interview Najee here and ask him a few questions.
[5127.56 --> 5130.46]  He's promised to keep his answers concise.
[5131.46 --> 5137.34]  And so we'll begin by just tell us, I think you did a little bit already, but tell us just
[5137.34 --> 5142.90]  a little bit about yourself and your family and then how the Lord brought you to Egypt.
[5142.90 --> 5153.70]  So many of you know that we came to Egypt in 2011 with our four young boys.
[5156.58 --> 5160.70]  And we feel like, you know, God has so blessed us.
[5160.86 --> 5165.02]  The team has really grown and that's become a kind of extended family for them.
[5165.02 --> 5174.36]  This year, we are just, you know, thrilled to see Jonathan just graduated from university
[5174.36 --> 5179.20]  at Calvin and Sebastian is there with him, finishing his second or finished his second
[5179.20 --> 5180.10]  year and working.
[5181.92 --> 5183.30]  Emmanuel just graduated.
[5183.44 --> 5187.26]  We saw a picture of him valedictorian in his high school class.
[5187.70 --> 5192.42]  And that's, it's been a really great school for him.
[5192.42 --> 5199.72]  We saw a picture of, you know, some kids in a soccer field there and Alex was off to one
[5199.72 --> 5200.58]  side grinning.
[5201.18 --> 5202.24]  That's his future.
[5202.54 --> 5208.16]  He wants to be a professional soccer player and, you know, they're all very unique.
[5208.80 --> 5215.14]  Anne is doing great, although, you know, also a challenging season for both of us in some
[5215.14 --> 5217.10]  ways, but maybe we'll talk a little bit more about that.
[5217.86 --> 5221.58]  We're grateful that her parents are in reasonable health.
[5221.58 --> 5223.88]  They live right beside us still.
[5224.66 --> 5230.98]  And so, yeah, a lot of things have been just a great year for us this year.
[5231.40 --> 5231.80]  Thank you.
[5232.56 --> 5238.36]  And so you are a missionary with Resonate Global Mission, which is our denomination's mission
[5238.36 --> 5239.28]  sending agency.
[5240.42 --> 5242.64]  And so what do you do for Resonate?
[5242.72 --> 5244.06]  And also what does your wife Anne do?
[5244.06 --> 5248.54]  So I am the regional leader for the Middle East.
[5248.54 --> 5256.70]  And when we started out, you know, 12 years ago, it was, there wasn't any, there weren't
[5256.70 --> 5261.46]  any missionaries in the Middle East from world missions or Resonate didn't exist at the time.
[5261.46 --> 5268.60]  And so I got to do a lot more like very direct hands on stuff with people.
[5269.06 --> 5271.92]  I've had periods where I do things like that.
[5272.18 --> 5276.06]  COVID, I was very much involved with direct things.
[5276.06 --> 5280.90]  But over the years, my life has become more and more on Zoom.
[5282.90 --> 5288.84]  And partly that's because our extended team has grown so much and is so spread out.
[5288.84 --> 5296.26]  So we have people like and partners in Bangladesh, you know, in some of the countries in like
[5296.26 --> 5304.42]  Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, in the Gulf, in Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan, people in Morocco.
[5304.86 --> 5309.26]  I have people on the West Coast here who I supervise, who work with me.
[5309.66 --> 5313.46]  And, you know, they're back and forth to Pakistan or into the Middle East.
[5314.12 --> 5316.86]  There's just a lot of moving parts and people.
[5316.86 --> 5323.46]  And so as a result, me being a regional leader, I have to be sort of supporting our team.
[5323.66 --> 5329.92]  And at the same time, I represent and help them to understand who we are as an organization,
[5330.20 --> 5330.62]  Resonate.
[5331.34 --> 5337.02]  And I help us to make connections to other regions so that we're doing sort of collaborative
[5337.02 --> 5337.66]  work.
[5339.00 --> 5339.78]  That's good.
[5340.40 --> 5343.88]  Oh, and Anne is a full-time professor at the seminary.
[5343.88 --> 5348.60]  Two years ago, she finished her PhD, but she had already been working for several years
[5348.60 --> 5349.46]  at the seminary.
[5349.56 --> 5355.14]  And so she finished and has been more and more still doing her teaching and things.
[5355.36 --> 5362.60]  But I think that when she got the PhD, they gave her a lot more administrative responsibilities,
[5362.60 --> 5365.30]  but with limitations.
[5365.30 --> 5370.72]  As a woman, they didn't want her to become the president of the seminary.
[5370.86 --> 5376.18]  So like last year, the seminary went through a major transition, and it's been a very rocky
[5376.18 --> 5382.06]  year because the, yeah, they need stronger administration.
[5382.06 --> 5388.94]  So she's had a challenging year, but she's managing.
[5390.94 --> 5399.04]  I think that while her parents are in reasonable health, she does still have a lot more role
[5399.04 --> 5402.08]  with them than anyone else in her family taking care of them.
[5402.08 --> 5405.58]  And so, but she also travels a lot.
[5405.76 --> 5412.24]  She's, she gets invited to speak in many different places, leading, or not leading, but being a
[5412.24 --> 5418.46]  speaker for conferences and doing lots of trainings, lots of recordings, video.
[5419.38 --> 5423.50]  She's trying to find time to write several books.
[5423.50 --> 5431.86]  So she's got like people, they kind of contracts of sorts where they've said, okay, by this date,
[5431.92 --> 5432.96]  you need that book done.
[5434.14 --> 5436.30]  This fall, she'll be in South Korea.
[5436.42 --> 5437.50]  I will join her.
[5437.88 --> 5441.52]  She's a speaker at Lausanne, which is like a major mission conference.
[5442.04 --> 5444.50]  So lots of things happening in her life too.
[5445.18 --> 5449.06]  You both sound very, very involved, very busy, a lot of stuff going on.
[5449.06 --> 5455.70]  Now, I want to ask, why do you think that God has called you to lead this team?
[5455.76 --> 5459.80]  And what in particular has God put on your heart as far as your ministry?
[5462.34 --> 5465.08]  I feel like, I mean, a couple of reasons.
[5465.40 --> 5473.42]  But the phrase that sort of catches me is that I feel God has given me a heart for the marginalized.
[5473.42 --> 5482.34]  So that includes, like we have in this region, in the Middle East, there's so much displacement
[5482.34 --> 5489.18]  because of war or in some cases it's religious reasons, lots of refugee.
[5490.34 --> 5497.46]  So when we came to Canada, I was an immigrant and our family were immigrants.
[5497.46 --> 5502.12]  And I always kind of felt on the edges of things, not in the center.
[5503.14 --> 5511.52]  I also feel like my dad, because he, today's Father's Day, he grew up in Syria as a Muslim,
[5511.66 --> 5512.56]  became a Christian.
[5512.56 --> 5523.22]  And so I always had this sort of awareness of the importance of support for new in their faith
[5523.22 --> 5530.46]  and helping kind of patiently working with them, no matter how difficult that might be.
[5530.46 --> 5538.30]  I think that I come at this from that perspective of a lot of love and respect for that type of a person
[5538.30 --> 5542.60]  and also a desire to reach out to a wider circle.
[5543.50 --> 5548.84]  So those, I think I bring that kind of thing to our team
[5548.84 --> 5552.46]  and just kind of keep encouraging people to be doing that kind of...
[5552.46 --> 5560.52]  In contrast, Anne grew up in the church in the Middle East.
[5561.06 --> 5566.22]  And the church in the Middle East, and especially in Egypt, is established.
[5567.04 --> 5569.90]  It goes back to the very beginning of Christianity.
[5570.80 --> 5573.46]  And there's this...
[5573.46 --> 5582.16]  I think we represent a balance between wanting to keep investing in the center of the church
[5582.16 --> 5587.32]  and support the survival and thriving of the local church in the Middle East,
[5587.32 --> 5592.54]  and me, you know, that's her, me just wanting to keep bringing new people into the church.
[5593.14 --> 5599.40]  And I think that maybe because of that, she and I help the team sort of keep that balance.
[5599.60 --> 5601.14]  Awesome. Yeah, sounds like a great partnership.
[5601.14 --> 5601.74]  Yeah.
[5602.40 --> 5607.58]  Last thing I want to ask is, what's one or two ways that we can pray for you?
[5609.00 --> 5609.40]  Okay.
[5611.12 --> 5612.38]  One way that we can pray for you.
[5612.38 --> 5614.38]  This is the hardest question to answer quickly.
[5619.98 --> 5621.14]  So...
[5621.14 --> 5630.30]  I have several people on our team.
[5633.84 --> 5635.14]  Whether they're...
[5635.14 --> 5639.78]  Okay, you know, some of the people I consider as part of my team are not resonate,
[5639.78 --> 5641.62]  but they are close.
[5642.58 --> 5645.88]  And we support them, you know, they're...
[5645.88 --> 5647.90]  Either financially, we support their projects.
[5648.10 --> 5650.76]  We're partners with an organization they're part of.
[5651.18 --> 5651.78]  But...
[5651.78 --> 5652.28]  But...
[5652.28 --> 5656.80]  I think there are people who have really struggled this year.
[5656.80 --> 5661.80]  I can think of one...
[5661.80 --> 5663.80]  New believer...
[5663.80 --> 5666.52]  I mean, he's been...
[5666.52 --> 5668.80]  He's a Muslim convert from...
[5668.80 --> 5673.42]  15 years ago or so.
[5673.62 --> 5679.80]  And over the years, he's really experienced a lot of traumatic physical abuse.
[5679.80 --> 5683.80]  And that has continued...
[5684.60 --> 5685.80]  It's just...
[5686.54 --> 5686.80]  It hasn't...
[5687.42 --> 5693.64]  The repercussions of it on his body are kind of like we're seeing the real impact now.
[5694.06 --> 5695.26]  It's getting worse and worse.
[5695.36 --> 5695.72]  It's hard.
[5695.86 --> 5704.28]  His health is poorer because of how much he was mistreated by the authorities for becoming a Christian.
[5704.28 --> 5712.46]  And in some way, he's a fantastic testimony to others and influences people on our team.
[5713.24 --> 5714.28]  Because he's...
[5714.28 --> 5715.28]  He's just...
[5716.08 --> 5716.28]  He...
[5716.80 --> 5717.94]  He doesn't complain.
[5718.42 --> 5720.06]  He just carries on.
[5720.32 --> 5720.88]  But...
[5720.88 --> 5723.42]  But we suffer with him and he really suffers.
[5723.78 --> 5729.38]  And we learn something about resilience and being a risk taker.
[5729.64 --> 5732.64]  And standing up for your faith despite opposition.
[5732.64 --> 5735.08]  So pray on that level.
[5735.94 --> 5736.64]  Pray also for...
[5737.30 --> 5742.92]  Maybe relatedly, I think of a young woman also not sent...
[5742.92 --> 5744.64]  Egyptian young woman who...
[5746.06 --> 5748.20]  You know, she grew up in a Christian.
[5748.64 --> 5755.90]  But now that she's more and more involved with us and with like working with sometimes foreigners or new believers.
[5757.26 --> 5761.68]  Sometimes sharing the gospel with people who are Muslims.
[5761.68 --> 5765.50]  I mean, she's a very important part of our team.
[5765.90 --> 5768.94]  She helps lead cohort, which is a youth program.
[5769.16 --> 5771.82]  And then also helps a little bit with our member care.
[5771.82 --> 5776.92]  She does something with us that's called New Hope.
[5778.26 --> 5779.86]  But her name's Tina.
[5781.30 --> 5786.10]  Tina's been taken into the police a couple of times these last couple of months.
[5786.56 --> 5788.94]  And interrogated.
[5788.94 --> 5789.94]  And...
[5789.94 --> 5790.94]  And...
[5790.94 --> 5794.70]  It's left her very shaken.
[5795.66 --> 5798.58]  She's, you know, 30, 35, single.
[5800.12 --> 5803.94]  So pray for the people in our team who...
[5803.94 --> 5812.14]  By virtue of being connected to us and sometimes us connected to them.
[5812.56 --> 5818.12]  They are experiencing or we are feeling what it feels like to suffer for the gospel.
[5818.12 --> 5820.12]  For...
[5820.12 --> 5822.12]  For...
[5822.64 --> 5828.12]  For Ann, I would like you to pray for...
[5828.98 --> 5837.06]  I think it's harder for her than it is for me when our kids leave the house.
[5837.06 --> 5841.06]  So on a level of being a mother...
[5841.06 --> 5844.18]  And now we have three out of the house.
[5845.42 --> 5847.00]  Alex is still with us.
[5848.32 --> 5852.60]  It'll be a little bit weird for him, having never had no brothers at home.
[5853.14 --> 5853.32]  You know?
[5853.78 --> 5855.28]  So maybe him too.
[5855.76 --> 5858.84]  But also for Ann, I think this has been a hard year.
[5858.92 --> 5860.34]  I mentioned administratively.
[5860.34 --> 5862.18]  But she's...
[5862.18 --> 5862.70]  She's...
[5862.70 --> 5865.32]  She's keeping on with the seminary.
[5866.34 --> 5870.82]  She has some slightly different positions this year and responsibilities.
[5871.22 --> 5876.84]  But really pray for her in that work and at the same time finding the balance.
[5877.30 --> 5879.00]  Like work-life balance.
[5880.38 --> 5885.84]  And feeling some strain or some challenges in both places.
[5886.24 --> 5886.40]  You know?
[5886.40 --> 5891.88]  So that's already a lot of time.
[5892.50 --> 5895.36]  That was fine.
[5897.26 --> 5897.74]  Let's...
[5897.74 --> 5898.98]  Let's go to the Lord in prayer right now.
[5899.14 --> 5900.86]  For Najee and his family, his ministry.
[5901.38 --> 5901.94]  And let's pray.
[5902.80 --> 5905.90]  Lord, I thank you so much for our brother Najee.
[5906.22 --> 5908.02]  Lord, we thank you that he could be with us today.
[5908.44 --> 5913.40]  That he can open up your word in just unique ways and so much insight into the culture.
[5913.40 --> 5915.50]  And how that informs the Bible.
[5915.80 --> 5917.32]  And how we can understand it better.
[5918.06 --> 5921.14]  Lord, we thank you for his sharing with us today.
[5922.04 --> 5926.06]  And Lord, for calling him to go to Egypt with his family.
[5927.32 --> 5927.84]  To...
[5927.84 --> 5929.92]  And to strengthen the church in Egypt.
[5930.16 --> 5932.84]  And Lord, you've made him the Middle East director.
[5933.44 --> 5935.44]  He has many hats to wear.
[5935.74 --> 5937.54]  And many people to keep track of.
[5937.54 --> 5943.36]  And Lord, we pray that you would be with him and guide him in his work.
[5943.56 --> 5945.82]  Give him the wisdom that he needs.
[5945.88 --> 5948.02]  The spiritual insight and discernment.
[5949.62 --> 5957.64]  And Lord, for all of the many different projects and the work of your kingdom that is happening all over the Middle East.
[5957.64 --> 5961.22]  Lord, we pray that you would be involved in each one of those things happening.
[5961.62 --> 5966.48]  That you would be with each one of those team members, partners, all those projects that are happening.
[5967.12 --> 5970.48]  Lord, that your glory would become known to more and more people.
[5971.34 --> 5980.86]  Lord, we pray for his wife Ann as she serves in the seminary and administration and teaching and speaking conferences and churches and so many things happening.
[5981.76 --> 5986.30]  Lord, would you also give her your grace to do that work that you've called her to.
[5986.30 --> 5991.44]  Would you be with them as a family, especially in this time of transition as the children grow and leave the home.
[5992.14 --> 5995.36]  Would you bless each one of them in the path that you will lead them on.
[5996.42 --> 5999.36]  So Lord, also be with Najee as he speaks with other churches.
[5999.96 --> 6002.16]  And would he be a blessing to each one of them.
[6003.06 --> 6007.92]  Lord, we also pray that you would be with our synod that is meeting in these days.
[6007.92 --> 6017.70]  And Lord, would you continue to guide our denomination in unity and faithfulness and in fruitfulness for your glory.
[6019.28 --> 6023.86]  Lord, we thank you for the new, again, the new officers that you have provided for us as a church.
[6023.92 --> 6027.58]  And would you sustain each one of them in the calling that you have given them.
[6027.58 --> 6032.66]  And Lord, as a church, that we would more and more reflect Acts chapter 2.
[6034.20 --> 6040.34]  The giving, being devoted to the teaching of the word and prayer and fellowship and evangelism.
[6040.74 --> 6041.94]  We pray, Lord, for your blessing.
[6042.46 --> 6043.28]  In Jesus' name.
[6043.54 --> 6043.74]  Amen.
[6043.74 --> 6043.82]  Amen.
[6045.24 --> 6046.56]  Now I invite you to stand.
[6047.08 --> 6049.38]  We'll go with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[6051.10 --> 6054.40]  Please join us for a time of fellowship right through the doors.
[6055.24 --> 6059.32]  And I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[6059.32 --> 6064.68]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all that we ask or imagine,
[6065.12 --> 6068.06]  according to his power that is at work within us,
[6068.54 --> 6074.88]  to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.
[6075.54 --> 6075.88]  Amen.
[6075.88 --> 6075.96]  Amen.
[6089.32 --> 6090.54]  Amen.
[6090.54 --> 6102.10]  Amen.
[6102.10 --> 6104.06]  Amen.
[6104.06 --> 6104.54]  Amen.
[6104.78 --> 6106.32]  Amen.
[6107.08 --> 6107.62]  Go with me, amen.
[6107.62 --> 6108.74]  Vambo us, Jesus.
[6108.74 --> 6109.24]  Amen.
[6109.24 --> 6111.20]  Amen.
[6115.20 --> 6115.62]  Amen.
[6115.62 --> 6116.30]  Amen.
[6116.84 --> 6117.40]  Amen.
[6117.96 --> 6118.46]  Amen.
[6118.46 --> 6119.22]  Amen.
[6119.22 --> 6119.28]  Amen.
[6119.28 --> 6119.30]  Amen.
[6119.30 --> 6124.30]  He gives us hope, He does know today.
[6127.30 --> 6131.30]  By your grace we've been saved,
[6131.30 --> 6134.30]  born again to love.
[6134.30 --> 6138.30]  Joined by faith, born in awe,
[6138.30 --> 6142.30]  for your glory, Lord.
[6142.30 --> 6145.30]  Let us peace and unity
[6145.30 --> 6149.30]  with us now we pray,
[6149.30 --> 6153.30]  and with hands so free,
[6153.30 --> 6156.30]  find us Lord and use us Lord,
[6156.30 --> 6161.30]  He does know today.
[6175.30 --> 6181.30]  I've been living here today,
[6181.30 --> 6188.30]  to allow You has power w argued,
[6188.30 --> 6191.30]  and stand for what I veio to bear.
[6191.30 --> 6193.30]  Also sit for you and I go read his name.
[6193.30 --> 6197.30]  I say last year in a tenth line with my daughter,
[6197.30 --> 6227.28]  Thank you.
[6227.30 --> 6257.28]  Thank you.
