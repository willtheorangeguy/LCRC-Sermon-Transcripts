[258.00 → 260.00] Good morning, everybody.
[260.00 → 261.00] I was going to start out with some sort of wisecrack.
[261.00 → 265.00] There's nobody actually here so late in August.
[265.00 → 268.00] But in truth, there are quite a few folks here.
[268.00 → 270.00] In part, that's because it's a family Sunday
[270.00 → 273.10] and we have our Chinese brethren and sisters with us as well.
[273.10 → 274.70] Welcome to you again.
[274.70 → 279.26] And I just learned that Christie's parents are here.
[279.26 → 281.86] From where again?
[281.86 → 283.16] Virginia.
[283.16 → 285.94] Okay. We couldn't exchange all that much information,
[285.94 → 288.86] but welcome to you.
[288.86 → 290.10] So we have a crowd this morning.
[290.10 → 291.86] That's great.
[291.86 → 295.66] I also welcome Roger Gross who came from long distances
[295.66 → 297.30] to enjoy playing this morning.
[297.30 → 299.66] He says he likes playing piano so much,
[299.66 → 302.34] he's willing to drive from Abbotsford to be with us this morning.
[302.34 → 306.74] So, so.
[306.74 → 308.94] If you're a visitor here, we have a good time.
[308.94 → 311.90] And so after this service, we have coffee and tea after,
[311.90 → 316.56] and you are invited to join with us in the fellowship hall behind us.
[316.56 → 320.00] Pastor Jason and his family are back from some holidays,
[320.00 → 323.46] although they had to get altered by things like floods and fire,
[323.46 → 325.10] or at least the threat of it.
[325.10 → 327.46] And, but they still had a good time by all.
[327.46 → 329.24] And he's going to continue his,
[329.24 → 333.04] his sermon series called A Summer in the Psalms.
[333.04 → 336.94] Today we dive, he tackles Psalm 24.
[336.94 → 343.48] It's in the bulletin, but just a little advance warning.
[343.48 → 348.98] Joel Vulturine's funeral service, or memorial service, will be in September.
[348.98 → 351.98] It's at a Saturday at 1 p.m.
[351.98 → 354.34] I'm sure many of you would like to mark your calendar.
[354.34 → 359.92] And it is in the bulletin, and there may be some more details there, but just a reminder of that.
[359.92 → 368.34] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 100.
[368.34 → 373.74] If you were here two weeks ago, Gary Rosemont preached a whole sermon on Psalm 100,
[373.74 → 379.04] and we're going to read most of it this morning because it, it makes a perfect call to worship.
[379.04 → 384.58] And if you remember what Gary said, when we say shout to the Lord, we don't say shout to the Lord.
[384.58 → 386.68] We shout to the Lord.
[386.68 → 394.90] So I say that because when we start this one this morning, it's back and forth between you and me, but you get to start.
[394.90 → 399.90] So let's read Psalm 100 together as a call to worship.
[399.90 → 404.90] Shout to the Lord, all the earth.
[404.90 → 407.74] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[407.74 → 410.84] Come before him with joyful songs.
[410.84 → 413.36] Know that the Lord is God.
[413.36 → 417.66] It is he who made us, and we are his.
[417.66 → 421.90] We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[421.90 → 425.90] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[425.90 → 428.90] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[428.90 → 433.90] For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[433.90 → 438.90] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[438.90 → 444.90] With that in mind, would you join me in a brief prayer of adoration this morning?
[444.90 → 450.90] Thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity of worship.
[450.90 → 457.90] For the freedom to be among your family, meeting together in your house and with the warmth of your embrace.
[457.90 → 467.90] Thank you that in worship we can put aside the uncertainties of this world and rest on the certainties of your presence and guidance.
[467.90 → 473.90] For your promises are not changeable, but immovable and eternal.
[473.90 → 485.90] Thank you that we can bring to your feet all the hurts and fears that trouble us and leave them there, knowing that your strength and assurance are all that we require.
[485.90 → 492.90] As we draw near in worship, transport us from a world of concerns and fears to a place where we can be at peace in your presence.
[492.90 → 497.90] Where we can find healing, wholeness, refreshment.
[497.90 → 502.90] Thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity of worship.
[502.90 → 503.90] Amen.
[503.90 → 510.90] The Lord's greeting to us comes from Isaiah 42, several verses.
[510.90 → 512.90] I am the Lord.
[512.90 → 514.90] I have called you in righteousness.
[514.90 → 516.90] I have taken you by the hand and kept you.
[516.90 → 522.90] I have kept you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind.
[522.90 → 524.90] I am the Lord.
[524.90 → 525.90] That is my name.
[525.90 → 531.90] My glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.
[531.90 → 536.90] Please stand and say hello to the person behind you.
[536.90 → 537.90] Thank you.
[537.90 → 538.90] Thank you.
[538.90 → 539.90] Thank you.
[539.90 → 540.90] Thank you.
[540.90 → 542.90] Thank you, Mr. Dick.
[542.90 → 543.90] Thank you.
[543.90 → 546.90] My honour is the smell of the people.
[546.90 → 557.90] Thank you.
[557.90 → 558.90] Thank you.
[558.90 → 560.90] Thank you.
[560.90 → 561.90] Thank you.
[561.90 → 564.90] Thank you very much.
[564.90 → 565.90] Thank you.
[565.90 → 595.88] Thank you.
[595.90 → 625.88] Thank you.
[625.90 → 627.90] Thank you.
[655.90 → 657.90] Thank you.
[685.90 → 687.90] Thank you.
[687.90 → 689.90] Thank you.
[689.90 → 691.90] Thank you.
[719.90 → 721.90] Thank you.
[749.90 → 751.90] Thank you.
[751.90 → 755.90] Thank you.
[755.90 → 777.96] Praise God for today,
[777.96 → 782.40] Hallelujah and I and David
[782.40 → 786.36] So brought my ears to save me time
[786.36 → 790.54] To I go to the house
[790.54 → 815.62] O Lord my God, I will not surrender
[815.62 → 822.78] And say enough, O God's flag and I will
[822.78 → 827.82] I'm seated, dance under Sunday
[827.82 → 835.32] Verse ave I when I speak well
[835.32 → 840.88] RetechnoNONI will sing with sing perfect
[841.50 → 854.52] You're live, you're live, it stands to course by IKE 276.
[854.54 → 862.36] You're live, you're live now
[862.36 → 892.36] Hill Wouldn't
[892.36 → 900.08] Height Lamb is filled with gum
[900.08 → 911.74] Let who know In the house
[911.74 → 919.86] He shall confess his word
[919.86 → 935.24] When Christ shall come, he'll shout the salvation, and bless his own, the joy shall fill my heart.
[935.24 → 949.82] Then I shall bow, in the blue adoration, and then to pray, my love, the great love.
[949.82 → 979.80] Then I shall bow, in the blue adoration, and then to pray, my love, the great love.
[979.82 → 1009.80] Then I shall bow, in the blue adoration, and then to pray, my love, the great love.
[1009.80 → 1014.36] He's going to continue that as he delves into Psalm 24 this morning.
[1016.86 → 1020.70] But possibly, your God is too small.
[1020.70 → 1030.90] That was the title of a book by a fellow named J.B. Phillips, who published this a couple of years after I was born, so it's an old book.
[1030.90 → 1044.06] But the point of the book, without going into it, was sometimes we view God in ways that unconsciously, and I say we, I mean me, that we limit him in some ways.
[1044.06 → 1048.18] And there are a variety of ways, and I'm going into that book.
[1048.26 → 1053.14] One of the ways is illustrated by this picture up here.
[1053.14 → 1060.44] This is Michelangelo painting things on the Sistine Chapel.
[1060.52 → 1061.42] We've seen this in person.
[1061.52 → 1063.12] It's quite fun to take a look at.
[1063.12 → 1075.58] But it's God as some person in flowing robes, the long beard, rather patriarchal, nice fellow, very close to Adam, in a sky that's right here.
[1075.58 → 1086.68] This is a God who created the heavens and the earth, but we really think of it as, well, the earth, because it's beautiful and big and wonderful.
[1087.16 → 1088.12] Oh, yeah, and the heavens.
[1088.60 → 1092.42] Blue sky of the day and some bright spots in the sky at night.
[1092.42 → 1107.08] But if you believe God created the heavens and the earth, well, the earth is one rock circling around the sun, one of eight rocks or gas balls circling around this sun.
[1107.14 → 1117.36] In the Milky Way, our galaxy, which has at least 100 billion stars, and it's taken them a while to figure it out, but if they look carefully,
[1117.36 → 1128.00] our galaxy is one of 2,000, 200,000, no, possibly 200 billion, not stars, galaxies.
[1128.90 → 1133.48] That's the cosmos that our God operates in.
[1134.52 → 1135.62] He created it.
[1136.04 → 1137.04] He sustains it.
[1137.86 → 1141.74] He's anywhere he wishes to be in it at any time and place.
[1141.74 → 1149.06] And yet, he takes the time to be on one little rock third away from the sun.
[1153.78 → 1157.40] But when he chooses, he can almost be physically near to us.
[1158.02 → 1163.04] Well, think Moses talking to God daily in the tent at the edge of the Israelite camp.
[1163.04 → 1169.88] Think of him investing a measure of his being into a human for a time.
[1170.56 → 1171.80] Think Jesus, our Saviour.
[1173.68 → 1180.84] Or he moves mysteriously among us, showing power and guidance in very tangible ways.
[1181.48 → 1183.26] Think the Holy Spirit.
[1183.26 → 1184.26] Think of God.
[1186.72 → 1197.16] So when we think of God from that heaven's perspective, I know I am mightily humbled and awed by his desire to maintain contact with us
[1197.16 → 1204.10] and how he encourages us and wants us to be faithful and to avoid wrongdoing.
[1204.32 → 1209.38] And some thousands of years ago, he gave us what we often call the law, the Ten Commandments.
[1209.38 → 1215.84] Those Ten Commandments used to be, for you Chinese brethren, in our tradition, used to be read every Sunday.
[1216.44 → 1220.26] We don't do that anymore, and I'm not promoting that that should ever be done again.
[1220.80 → 1226.32] But we should do our best to remember those basic Ten Commandments now and again.
[1226.60 → 1227.76] Let's do that this morning.
[1228.12 → 1235.92] I'm going to ask you to read the basic commandment, and then I have some words that are contemporizing what those Ten Commandments mean.
[1235.92 → 1239.08] I think we also have the Chinese translation above them.
[1239.38 → 1240.18] But I'm not certain.
[1240.30 → 1241.12] It was a busy week.
[1242.56 → 1245.72] Could you please read the commandment, and I'll read something after each one.
[1247.02 → 1249.62] Shall have no other gods before me.
[1250.66 → 1253.76] Do not worship any other god than the one true God.
[1253.88 → 1255.88] All others are false gods.
[1257.36 → 1260.38] You shall not make for yourselves an idol.
[1260.38 → 1263.96] Do not make idols or images in the form of God.
[1263.96 → 1270.74] But further, an idol can also be anything or anyone you worship by making it more important than God.
[1271.00 → 1274.66] If something has your time and attention, it could be an idol in your life.
[1275.18 → 1276.34] Work can become an idol.
[1276.78 → 1277.88] So can material goods.
[1278.98 → 1285.12] Do not allow music, computers, or similar activities to be more important in your life than God.
[1285.12 → 1290.38] You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
[1291.30 → 1293.36] Do not treat God's name with disrespect.
[1293.66 → 1296.26] Do not use God's name lightly or as a swear word.
[1297.42 → 1298.66] Honour God with your words.
[1299.04 → 1305.20] When we don't, we diminish ourselves, and we diminish God in whose image we are created.
[1305.20 → 1310.96] Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[1312.00 → 1317.44] Dedicate a regular day each week for rest and worship of the Lord and to be with his family.
[1319.94 → 1322.24] Honour your father and your mother.
[1323.34 → 1327.24] Love and respect your parents at all times, even when you disagree with them.
[1329.24 → 1330.78] You shall not murder.
[1332.20 → 1334.86] Do not deliberately kill a fellow human being.
[1335.94 → 1338.18] Further, or even think about killing someone.
[1338.68 → 1343.52] But even further, don't hate people or hurt them with words and actions.
[1345.42 → 1347.58] You shall not commit adultery.
[1348.60 → 1351.50] Do not have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse.
[1352.04 → 1355.74] But further, respect your body and other people's bodies.
[1358.36 → 1360.16] You shall not steal.
[1360.86 → 1362.06] Yes, do not steal.
[1362.06 → 1365.18] Further, respect the property of other people.
[1365.28 → 1368.46] Do not take anything that belongs to someone else without permission.
[1370.68 → 1373.04] You shall not give false testimony.
[1373.90 → 1378.22] Do not tell a lie about someone or bring false accusation against another person.
[1378.22 → 1381.16] But further, strive to tell the truth at all times.
[1381.96 → 1384.44] Sometimes it seems like truth is under siege today.
[1384.96 → 1387.22] There are times when facts are not entirely clear.
[1387.56 → 1389.86] But often the truth can be determined.
[1390.08 → 1392.56] And it is important for us to do so.
[1392.56 → 1398.74] And number 10, you shall not covet anything that is your neighbour's.
[1399.40 → 1402.20] Do not spend time wishing you had what belongs to someone else.
[1402.84 → 1407.38] Wishing to have what they have can lead to jealousy and envy and other wrongs.
[1407.80 → 1416.34] Be content with what you have and with the talents and skills God has given you, knowing that everything is a gift from God.
[1416.34 → 1427.38] In thinking of Jesus' summary of the law, we must admit that there are times when we have not loved the Lord our God with all our hearts, our souls, and with all our minds.
[1427.38 → 1431.40] And we have not always loved our neighbours as ourselves.
[1434.04 → 1436.02] Even so, we have words of assurance.
[1436.94 → 1438.70] These come from Colossians 2.
[1438.70 → 1441.64] Brothers and sisters, hear the good news.
[1442.14 → 1443.70] God has forgiven your sins.
[1444.24 → 1449.06] Christ has utterly wiped out the damning evidence that hangs over our heads.
[1449.36 → 1454.30] And has rendered it powerless by nailing it over his own head on the cross.
[1454.98 → 1456.98] In Christ, we have new life.
[1457.58 → 1459.66] A chance to begin again.
[1460.68 → 1463.28] Our song of response echoes those themes.
[1463.28 → 1465.38] My hope is built on nothing less.
[1468.70 → 1488.24] Poison songs around the main
[1488.24 → 1493.50] I was written in Christ.
[1493.50 → 1494.62] Whom, you need for something
[1494.62 → 1496.60] end, you need for words that depots
[1496.60 → 1500.92] I am all divided
[1501.00 → 1504.52] I have four more people
[1505.16 → 1509.34] they may describe, their Vitré
[1510.36 → 1514.56] I have two Locazadaes people
[1514.56 → 1519.88] I have one rest watch all my hold
[1519.94 → 1525.56] for some of his two ways
[1525.56 → 1529.88] Can darkness gaze is love intranet.
[1530.06 → 1534.34] The rest of His all-changing grace.
[1534.56 → 1538.34] He begins with eyes to begin.
[1538.78 → 1543.86] My anchor holds, prays in the ничего.
[1544.26 → 1549.44] Augustus, young Later.
[1549.52 → 1553.04] Jay over temp on, deles graduation.
[1553.04 → 1559.04] All around His kingdom is done.
[1559.04 → 1564.04] The Bible says,
[1564.04 → 1569.04] The Bible says,
[1569.04 → 1574.04] The Bible says,
[1574.04 → 1579.04] The Bible says,
[1579.04 → 1595.04] The Bible says,
[1595.04 → 1600.04] The Bible says,
[1600.04 → 1604.04] The Bible says,
[1604.04 → 1614.04] The Bible says,
[1614.04 → 1618.04] The Bible says,
[1618.04 → 1630.04] All around His kingdom is done.
[1630.04 → 1653.04] So friends, as we prepare to approach the Lord's table this morning, we have the opportunity to confess our faith together.
[1653.04 → 1661.04] And our profession, our confession of faith this morning comes from the Westminster Shorter Catechism, question and answer one.
[1661.04 → 1663.04] And so here it is.
[1663.04 → 1668.04] The question is, before we answer, I'll give a little explanation.
[1668.04 → 1671.04] What is the chief end of man?
[1671.04 → 1672.04] Now, what does that mean?
[1672.04 → 1676.04] That means, what on earth are we here for?
[1676.04 → 1682.04] What is the purpose for which God has created us?
[1682.04 → 1685.04] As John reminded us, God has created the cosmos.
[1685.04 → 1687.04] He has made each one of us.
[1687.04 → 1688.04] He has put us on this planet.
[1688.04 → 1690.04] He cares for us.
[1690.04 → 1692.04] And why are we here?
[1692.04 → 1694.04] What should we live for?
[1694.04 → 1696.04] So, let's answer together.
[1696.04 → 1705.04] Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.
[1705.04 → 1710.04] What does God want of you in your life?
[1710.04 → 1713.04] He wants you to glorify Him.
[1713.04 → 1714.04] And how do we do that?
[1714.04 → 1716.04] To enjoy Him.
[1716.04 → 1718.04] To enjoy Him forever.
[1718.04 → 1722.04] And those things go hand in hand to glorify God and enjoy Him.
[1722.04 → 1726.04] They're not separate things, but we do them together.
[1726.04 → 1729.04] We glorify God by enjoying Him.
[1729.04 → 1730.04] So that's what we remember.
[1730.04 → 1734.04] So now, what do we need to glorify God and to enjoy Him?
[1734.04 → 1737.04] What we need is Christ.
[1737.04 → 1738.04] We need Christ.
[1738.04 → 1742.04] And that is what He serves us in this supper.
[1742.04 → 1744.04] He serves us Himself.
[1745.04 → 1751.04] And so this meal unites us to Jesus Christ and His death and resurrection.
[1751.04 → 1757.04] It is therefore for those who have been united to Christ.
[1757.04 → 1761.04] If you have not yet put your faith in Jesus and have been baptized,
[1761.04 → 1764.04] it is not yet time to take this meal.
[1764.04 → 1769.04] It's a time for you to reflect and to receive His gospel.
[1769.04 → 1772.04] To receive the Lord Jesus and what He has done for you.
[1772.04 → 1776.04] And I would love to talk to you after the service if that is you.
[1776.04 → 1783.04] But hear these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper.
[1783.04 → 1787.04] The Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed, He took bread.
[1787.04 → 1790.04] And when He had given thanks to God, He broke it.
[1790.04 → 1793.04] And said, this is my body which is for you.
[1793.04 → 1796.04] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1796.04 → 1805.04] In the same way, after supper, He took the cup saying, this cup is the covenant, the new covenant in my blood.
[1805.04 → 1810.04] Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[1810.04 → 1818.04] For whenever you eat this bread, and you drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again.
[1818.04 → 1825.04] Let's pray for this meal together. Let's pray.
[1825.04 → 1831.04] Father, we lift our hearts to you in praise and adoration and joy.
[1831.04 → 1834.04] For your gracious love to us in the gospel.
[1834.04 → 1840.04] And Lord, we thank you for the salvation that you accomplished for us through your death on the cross,
[1840.04 → 1845.04] and your resurrection from the dead, and your ascension to the right hand of God.
[1845.04 → 1849.04] Thank you for this meal that you have prepared for us.
[1849.04 → 1854.04] And Lord, would you set apart this bread and this cup for your purposes,
[1854.04 → 1859.04] that by the power of the Holy Spirit, that we would be united to Christ Jesus,
[1859.04 → 1862.04] who sits at your right hand this morning.
[1862.04 → 1871.04] Lord, would you nourish us, we pray in the name of Jesus, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1871.04 → 1878.04] May I ask our elders and deacons who are serving to come forward and help me distribute the elements.
[1878.04 → 1885.04] And so the way we serve the Lord's Supper here at Latin or CRC is that we will bring the plates to you,
[1885.04 → 1887.04] the bread first and then the cup.
[1887.04 → 1894.04] And while you wait, you can enjoy the music, you can take time to meditate, to pray to God.
[1894.04 → 1895.04] Amen.
[1895.04 → 1897.04] Amen.
[1897.04 → 1898.04] Amen.
[1898.04 → 1899.04] Amen.
[1899.04 → 1900.04] Amen.
[1900.04 → 1901.04] Amen.
[1901.04 → 1931.02] Thank you.
[1931.04 → 1961.02] Thank you.
[1961.04 → 1991.02] Thank you.
[1991.04 → 2021.02] Thank you.
[2021.04 → 2051.02] Thank you.
[2051.04 → 2081.02] Thank you.
[2081.04 → 2111.02] Thank you.
[2111.04 → 2141.02] Thank you.
[2141.04 → 2171.02] Thank you.
[2171.04 → 2201.02] Thank you.
[2201.04 → 2231.02] Thank you.
[2231.04 → 2261.02] Thank you.
[2261.04 → 2291.02] Thank you.
[2291.04 → 2321.02] Thank you.
[2321.04 → 2321.94] д
[2351.04 → 2357.60] throne at your right hand. He humbled himself by becoming a man and even to the point of death on
[2357.60 → 2367.76] a cross. But yet he rose again. He ascended back to heaven and so that one day every knee in heaven
[2367.76 → 2376.08] and on earth will bow in worship of our king. We thank you, Lord, that you have sacrificed yourself
[2376.08 → 2382.70] out of your love for us to forgive us, to reconcile us to God so that we might belong to him
[2382.70 → 2391.64] to be his sons and daughters. Lord, would you strengthen us as we go to live this Christian
[2391.64 → 2396.26] life as followers of you. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2396.26 → 2410.04] Amen. All right. So if there are some children in the room today, would you come up and join me up front?
[2410.04 → 2410.10] Amen.
[2426.26 → 2440.60] Hello. Hello. Hey. How are you? Good. Here, will you slide over some more space?
[2442.72 → 2452.08] All right. So how are you all today? Hello. How are you all? Hi. Hi. Are you guys enjoying the summer?
[2452.08 → 2456.92] Yeah. Okay. So I have a question for you. It's almost over. Almost over. I know.
[2458.86 → 2465.74] Who has been watching the Olympics? Oh, I kind of. Kind of? Have any of you watched any of the
[2465.74 → 2472.14] Olympic Games? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I know about it. Okay. Yeah. You know the Olympics or people are
[2472.14 → 2478.78] competing in different sports, right? Yeah. I've seen them in gymnastics. Gymnastics. Okay. So what are
[2478.78 → 2487.12] your favourite sports to watch in the Olympics? Anybody have a favourite they like to watch?
[2488.02 → 2494.22] Favourite sport to watch? Well, no. One of the ones I really like to watch this year was
[2494.22 → 2501.20] volleyball. It's amazing how high they can jump to block the ball. But I also like to watch running.
[2501.56 → 2507.00] I like to watch swimming. All kinds of things. Gymnastics. It's pretty amazing, right? God made us
[2507.00 → 2516.32] to do all these amazing things. He really did. So now the Bible talks about the Christian life
[2516.32 → 2522.10] like running a race. Did you know that? So in the Olympics, people run these races. And the Bible
[2522.10 → 2529.50] talks about being a Christian. It's like running a race. And so I want to share a verse with you. It says
[2529.50 → 2538.90] this. Hebrews chapter 12. Let us run with perseverance. The race marked out for us. What does perseverance
[2538.90 → 2546.18] mean? Run with perseverance. That means go all the way to the end. Run the whole race. Don't give up.
[2546.28 → 2551.94] Don't get tired. Don't stop. Right? You have to persevere to the end. And then it says,
[2551.94 → 2561.74] Jesus, the race marked out for us, let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[2562.34 → 2569.76] And so that reminds me that Jesus isn't just at the finish line, kind of looking at his watch,
[2569.84 → 2576.08] waiting for us. And, you know, and maybe we're so slow. I would be so slow. And Jesus is waiting.
[2576.08 → 2582.88] And, you know, maybe I'll trip. And, you know, I don't know. But you know what? Jesus has run the
[2582.88 → 2590.94] race himself. He finished it. And he was the winner. He was victorious. And he comes, and he runs it with
[2590.94 → 2598.54] us. He's always with us. He runs with us. Furthermore, he helps us. And he'll see us to the very end of the race.
[2599.38 → 2605.34] Okay? Is that cool? Yeah. So I want you to think of Jesus. When we are, when we believe in Jesus,
[2605.34 → 2611.78] he runs the race with us, and he'll bring us right to the finish line. Okay? All right. Cool.
[2611.98 → 2619.06] Let me pray for us. And then we can go to your class. Okay? Lord, we thank you that Jesus has won
[2619.06 → 2626.06] the race and that he has won the crown. And we thank you, Lord, that he strengthens us and helps us to run
[2626.06 → 2632.50] every step of the way in this Christian life. And that he will certainly see us right to the very end.
[2632.50 → 2638.78] And we will share in his victory. Help us to run, Lord, to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus.
[2639.26 → 2643.04] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. All right. Go ahead to your class.
[2649.04 → 2653.84] All right. And, yeah, our Chinese brothers and sisters can go to their worship time as well.
[2653.84 → 2666.18] Amen.
[2678.20 → 2680.26] Amen.
[2680.26 → 2695.84] so good morning and as many of you know I was away for a time of relaxation with my family over the
[2695.84 → 2704.02] last few weeks and as much as we enjoyed it I'm also glad to be back and so during the summer as
[2704.02 → 2710.92] John also mentioned we've been in the Psalms and that helps us in the summer especially when
[2710.92 → 2716.76] people are all over the place in the summer camping travelling so we can just each Sunday take
[2716.76 → 2721.44] a psalm and no one's going to miss anything well you miss that one psalm, but you know every Sunday you
[2721.44 → 2727.68] come you can hear a psalm, and so we will continue to do that through the month of August and today
[2727.68 → 2734.22] we will be in Psalm 24 so as we open our Bibles today I'm going to do something that we don't usually
[2734.22 → 2740.24] do, but I want to ask you to stand if you are able to stand in body or in spirit for the reading of God's
[2740.24 → 2751.66] Word so we'll have this the scriptures on the screen it's on page 410 in our Bibles if you want to follow
[2751.66 → 2761.20] along there page 410, so I will read it for us the earth is the Lord's and everything in it the world
[2761.20 → 2768.40] and all who live in it for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters who may
[2768.40 → 2775.70] ascend the hill of the Lord who may stand in his holy place he who has clean hands and a pure heart
[2775.70 → 2782.16] who does not lift his soul to an idol or swear by what is false he will receive blessing from the
[2782.16 → 2790.38] Lord and vindication from God his Saviour such is the generation of those who seek him who seek your face
[2790.38 → 2798.28] oh God of Jacob lift your heads oh gates be lifted you ancient doors that the king of glory may come
[2798.28 → 2805.12] in who is this king of glory the Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle
[2805.12 → 2812.68] lift your heads' oh you gate lift them up you ancient doors that the king of glory may come in
[2812.68 → 2822.28] who is he this king of glory the Lord almighty he is the king of glory let's pray
[2822.28 → 2835.00] come Holy Spirit would you use and overrule my words and all of our thoughts so that your word alone may be
[2835.00 → 2843.68] spoken in your word alone heard to the glory of Jesus Christ our Lord, and it is in his name we pray amen
[2843.68 → 2844.88] you may be seated
[2844.88 → 2857.26] well last week Bert Cleopatra or pastor Bert he preached on Psalm 23, and we know which is probably has some of
[2857.26 → 2869.20] the most well-known words in all the Bible the Lord is my shepherd and while Psalm 24 is less well known
[2869.20 → 2880.54] there are some truths we learn about God in Psalm 24 that are as majestic as anything else that you will find in God's word
[2880.54 → 2890.42] and it is so it's very important to know the context of the psalm what's going on in the history of when this psalm was written
[2890.42 → 2898.56] it was written by King David it was sung originally as part of a very big and boisterous worship celebration
[2898.56 → 2909.24] and so the situation was David was bringing the ark of the covenant the ark of the Lord that box with the ten commandments in it
[2909.24 → 2918.58] he was bringing it to Jerusalem and if you look at 2nd Samuel chapter 6 David had defeated the Philistines the enemies of God's people
[2918.58 → 2929.50] and so David is this warrior king, and he's returning with the ark of the Lord which is where God is peculiarly present with his people
[2929.50 → 2938.88] and he's coming to Jerusalem to the tabernacle on the hill and everybody is celebrating this great victory of the king of Israel
[2938.88 → 2942.40] and that God is coming to dwell with his people
[2942.40 → 2948.18] it's a celebration also with a lot of action in it
[2948.18 → 2953.86] so it's this procession of worship the people are marching into the city
[2953.86 → 2962.32] they are marching up the hill with King David and the priests and the people singing and responding in this song of Psalm 24
[2962.32 → 2966.88] and so it starts at the bottom of the hill in Jerusalem
[2966.88 → 2975.38] and in verses 1 and 2 there's this call by the whole congregation to know that God is the one who created the whole world
[2975.38 → 2978.32] and all that is in it belongs to him
[2978.32 → 2980.28] and then they move up
[2980.28 → 2984.38] and a question is asked by the whole congregation which is
[2984.38 → 2988.92] well who may ascend this holy mountain
[2988.92 → 2994.04] who can go up to the place where God's presence is
[2994.04 → 2998.64] and the answer is that it's those who have clean hands and a pure heart
[2998.64 → 3003.54] in other words people who live out a holy life
[3003.54 → 3010.96] and then it ends with this joyful call to open up the gates of the city
[3010.96 → 3018.28] so that the king of glory may actually come in and enter and to live with his people
[3018.28 → 3021.52] and so that is what is happening here
[3021.52 → 3027.38] and it's the people of God are renewing their understanding of God's glory
[3027.38 → 3029.76] their understanding of whom this God is
[3029.76 → 3031.22] who fashioned them
[3031.22 → 3033.20] who wanted to be their God
[3033.20 → 3036.28] and they're renewing their commitment as a people
[3036.28 → 3037.96] to worship this God
[3037.96 → 3039.06] the one true God
[3039.06 → 3040.86] who has come to live with them
[3040.86 → 3042.74] and so this morning
[3042.74 → 3045.38] what I want to do is look at three aspects
[3045.38 → 3047.42] aspects of God's glory
[3047.42 → 3050.12] that just kind of shine forth
[3050.12 → 3051.10] that show forth
[3051.10 → 3052.58] from this psalm
[3052.58 → 3054.66] the first thing we're going to see
[3054.66 → 3056.50] is that God is glorious
[3056.50 → 3058.70] because he created the whole earth
[3058.70 → 3059.78] and everything in it
[3059.78 → 3062.26] secondly we're going to see that God is glorious
[3062.26 → 3063.80] because he is our saviour
[3063.80 → 3065.70] and then thirdly
[3065.70 → 3066.80] that God is glorious
[3066.80 → 3069.58] because he is the king of glory
[3069.58 → 3071.40] okay so we're going to look briefly
[3071.40 → 3072.70] at each one of these
[3072.70 → 3074.20] and the first one is
[3074.20 → 3075.98] we see that God is glorious
[3075.98 → 3077.60] because he is our creator
[3077.60 → 3079.94] and he actually establishes
[3079.94 → 3082.46] that the earth is his
[3082.46 → 3083.86] everything in it
[3083.86 → 3085.10] and everyone in it
[3085.10 → 3086.52] so let's have a look
[3086.52 → 3087.52] at verse one
[3087.52 → 3089.30] it says
[3089.30 → 3091.52] the earth is the Lord's
[3091.52 → 3092.92] and everything in it
[3092.92 → 3093.88] the world
[3093.88 → 3095.02] and all
[3095.02 → 3096.68] who live in it
[3096.68 → 3098.86] in other words
[3098.86 → 3100.62] everything in this world
[3100.62 → 3101.60] belongs to the Lord
[3101.60 → 3102.90] right
[3102.90 → 3103.66] everything
[3103.66 → 3105.06] belongs
[3105.06 → 3105.78] to the Lord
[3105.78 → 3107.30] every person
[3107.30 → 3108.54] everyone
[3108.54 → 3110.80] belongs to the Lord
[3110.80 → 3111.82] some translations say
[3111.82 → 3112.42] the fullness
[3112.42 → 3113.52] of the world
[3113.52 → 3114.74] is God's
[3114.74 → 3115.88] and you know
[3115.88 → 3116.60] and so often
[3116.60 → 3117.64] we are impressed
[3117.64 → 3118.64] by people
[3118.64 → 3119.92] who have
[3119.92 → 3120.20] you know
[3120.20 → 3121.10] a lot of wealth
[3121.10 → 3122.36] or who have a lot of prestige
[3122.36 → 3123.68] and they own this
[3123.68 → 3124.74] and they own that
[3124.74 → 3126.88] but you read this psalm
[3126.88 → 3127.58] and you realize
[3127.58 → 3128.48] that the earth
[3128.48 → 3130.44] and everything in it
[3130.44 → 3130.64] you know
[3130.64 → 3131.70] all the houses
[3131.70 → 3134.20] the vacation houses
[3134.20 → 3134.90] the boats
[3134.90 → 3135.54] the trailers
[3135.54 → 3136.80] all the stuff people have
[3136.80 → 3138.80] but also the islands
[3138.80 → 3140.12] the deserts
[3140.12 → 3140.68] the mountains
[3140.68 → 3141.48] the rivers
[3141.48 → 3142.48] the oceans
[3142.48 → 3143.54] all the gold
[3143.54 → 3144.64] all the diamonds
[3144.64 → 3146.78] everything is actually
[3146.78 → 3148.46] the Lord's
[3148.46 → 3150.64] it is all the Lord's
[3150.64 → 3153.04] now what is the point
[3153.04 → 3155.14] of Psalm 24 opening
[3155.14 → 3155.74] by saying
[3155.74 → 3157.36] everything belongs to God
[3157.36 → 3159.14] well it's actually
[3159.14 → 3160.00] quite important
[3160.00 → 3161.88] because there's this
[3161.88 → 3163.00] there's this idea
[3163.00 → 3164.30] in the ancient world
[3164.30 → 3165.22] that there are
[3165.22 → 3166.36] different gods
[3166.36 → 3167.84] assigned to different
[3167.84 → 3168.56] locales
[3168.56 → 3170.16] and to different things
[3170.16 → 3171.20] right
[3171.20 → 3171.78] so there's a god
[3171.78 → 3172.54] of this mountain
[3172.54 → 3173.56] or this river
[3173.56 → 3174.78] this you know
[3174.78 → 3175.46] this place
[3175.46 → 3175.98] or this
[3175.98 → 3176.74] this item
[3176.74 → 3177.34] in creation
[3177.34 → 3178.92] and that is why
[3178.92 → 3180.04] the apostle Paul
[3180.04 → 3180.78] in Corinthians
[3180.78 → 3182.70] he says
[3182.70 → 3183.76] that they can eat
[3183.76 → 3185.04] any food
[3185.04 → 3185.68] right
[3185.68 → 3186.54] even food
[3186.54 → 3187.18] that is offered
[3187.18 → 3187.78] to an idol
[3187.78 → 3188.48] in the marketplace
[3188.48 → 3190.12] because there are
[3190.12 → 3191.50] no real idols
[3191.50 → 3192.66] there are no real
[3192.66 → 3194.28] so-called gods
[3194.28 → 3195.94] other than the true God
[3195.94 → 3197.22] and so you don't need
[3197.22 → 3197.98] to be concerned
[3197.98 → 3199.20] that someone's like
[3199.20 → 3199.68] oh you know
[3199.68 → 3200.42] this food belongs
[3200.42 → 3201.06] to this god
[3201.06 → 3201.88] or to that god
[3201.88 → 3202.44] he says
[3202.44 → 3203.34] no God owns
[3203.34 → 3204.10] everything
[3204.10 → 3205.92] everything belongs
[3205.92 → 3206.40] to him
[3206.40 → 3207.06] and so
[3207.06 → 3208.06] Paul
[3208.06 → 3209.94] quotes
[3209.94 → 3210.80] Psalm 24
[3210.80 → 3213.00] in 1 Corinthians 10
[3213.00 → 3213.60] to say that
[3213.60 → 3214.50] God owns everything
[3214.50 → 3216.12] and that is why
[3216.12 → 3217.04] you don't need to worry
[3217.04 → 3218.32] about a god here
[3218.32 → 3219.22] or a god there
[3219.22 → 3220.90] because God
[3220.90 → 3221.68] owns
[3221.68 → 3222.58] everything
[3222.58 → 3223.48] everything is to be
[3223.48 → 3224.52] enjoyed as a gift
[3224.52 → 3225.42] from God
[3225.42 → 3227.96] and because God
[3227.96 → 3228.58] owns everything
[3228.58 → 3229.50] also therefore
[3229.50 → 3231.90] he is the only god
[3231.90 → 3233.32] to be worshipped
[3233.32 → 3234.38] right
[3234.38 → 3236.34] and so whether
[3236.34 → 3237.78] you are an Israelite
[3237.78 → 3239.10] or a Philistine
[3239.10 → 3241.26] or any other nation
[3241.26 → 3242.56] God is the one
[3242.56 → 3242.78] who
[3242.78 → 3244.92] is worthy
[3244.92 → 3245.88] alone
[3245.88 → 3247.02] of being worshipped
[3247.02 → 3249.02] so now
[3249.02 → 3250.02] there is a surprise
[3250.02 → 3251.62] in verse 2
[3251.62 → 3253.94] because David says
[3253.94 → 3254.96] that God
[3254.96 → 3256.32] has founded it
[3256.32 → 3256.92] the earth
[3256.92 → 3258.02] on the seas
[3258.02 → 3259.10] and established it
[3259.10 → 3260.44] on the waters
[3260.44 → 3261.20] okay
[3261.20 → 3262.02] so this is like
[3262.02 → 3263.62] 2000 BC
[3263.62 → 3265.88] the cosmology
[3265.88 → 3266.44] of the people
[3266.44 → 3267.10] of that time
[3267.10 → 3267.76] was that the earth
[3267.76 → 3268.38] is flat
[3268.38 → 3269.40] that there are waters
[3269.40 → 3269.94] below
[3269.94 → 3271.14] there are waters beneath
[3271.14 → 3272.06] it is not making
[3272.06 → 3273.14] a scientific claim
[3273.14 → 3274.30] but what it is saying
[3274.30 → 3275.18] here is that
[3275.18 → 3275.86] just in the minds
[3275.86 → 3276.42] of the people
[3276.42 → 3278.52] is teaching the truth
[3278.52 → 3280.22] that God
[3280.22 → 3281.58] has established
[3281.58 → 3282.62] the creation
[3282.62 → 3283.66] so now
[3283.66 → 3285.12] in ancient thought
[3285.12 → 3286.48] the seas
[3286.48 → 3287.36] and the waters
[3287.36 → 3288.82] represented chaos
[3288.82 → 3290.68] they represented death
[3290.68 → 3291.38] right
[3291.38 → 3292.34] you think of the flood
[3292.34 → 3293.74] or you can think of
[3293.74 → 3294.84] in creation
[3294.84 → 3295.66] when the spirit
[3295.66 → 3296.20] of God
[3296.20 → 3296.82] was hovering
[3296.82 → 3298.60] over the waters
[3298.60 → 3299.58] and then God
[3299.58 → 3300.32] came, and he brought
[3300.32 → 3302.00] order to creation
[3302.00 → 3302.90] and he established
[3302.90 → 3303.60] the world
[3303.60 → 3304.16] in order
[3304.16 → 3305.86] and so we're reminded
[3305.86 → 3306.40] here
[3306.40 → 3307.62] in this psalm
[3307.62 → 3308.06] that God
[3308.06 → 3309.50] took what is chaotic
[3309.50 → 3310.90] and formless
[3310.90 → 3311.86] and dark
[3311.86 → 3312.90] and evil
[3312.90 → 3315.36] and he very powerfully
[3315.36 → 3316.42] brought beauty
[3316.42 → 3317.96] and goodness
[3317.96 → 3318.78] and order
[3318.78 → 3320.46] into creation
[3320.46 → 3324.22] that's who our God is
[3324.22 → 3327.04] and so it reminds us
[3327.04 → 3327.18] you know
[3327.18 → 3327.76] when we think about
[3327.76 → 3328.46] our own lives
[3328.46 → 3329.44] our own situations
[3329.44 → 3330.14] of chaos
[3330.14 → 3331.76] or our situations
[3331.76 → 3332.46] of darkness
[3332.46 → 3333.58] that we experience
[3333.58 → 3334.34] or situations
[3334.34 → 3334.94] of evil
[3334.94 → 3336.12] we can know
[3336.12 → 3337.22] that God alone
[3337.22 → 3338.26] is the one
[3338.26 → 3339.88] who can bring order
[3339.88 → 3341.24] and he can bring
[3341.24 → 3341.74] goodness
[3341.74 → 3342.56] and he can shine
[3342.56 → 3343.16] hope
[3343.16 → 3344.72] into our lives
[3344.72 → 3346.08] because even
[3346.08 → 3347.14] those things
[3347.14 → 3348.70] are part of the world
[3348.70 → 3350.38] that belong to him
[3350.38 → 3351.42] and that he is
[3351.42 → 3352.06] sovereign over
[3352.06 → 3353.28] right
[3353.28 → 3353.70] in fact
[3353.70 → 3354.82] nothing in the world
[3354.82 → 3356.30] and nothing in our lives
[3356.30 → 3357.80] or the lives of anyone
[3357.80 → 3358.78] is outside
[3358.78 → 3360.34] of his ownership
[3360.34 → 3362.54] and so we can say
[3362.54 → 3363.30] all goodness
[3363.30 → 3364.62] all good things
[3364.62 → 3365.76] in this life
[3365.76 → 3366.70] are from God
[3366.70 → 3368.08] and also
[3368.08 → 3369.00] all the sin
[3369.00 → 3369.74] in our life
[3369.74 → 3371.70] all the sin
[3371.70 → 3372.26] in the lives
[3372.26 → 3372.70] of others
[3372.70 → 3373.48] all the chaos
[3373.48 → 3373.98] and darkness
[3373.98 → 3374.58] in the world
[3374.58 → 3375.66] is his
[3375.66 → 3376.70] to forgive
[3376.70 → 3377.88] is his
[3377.88 → 3378.70] to reconcile
[3378.70 → 3380.28] and to judge
[3380.28 → 3382.30] and all darkness
[3382.30 → 3383.22] and evil
[3383.22 → 3383.82] is his
[3383.82 → 3384.60] to overcome
[3384.60 → 3387.56] that is the truth
[3387.56 → 3388.02] of these
[3388.02 → 3389.50] first two verses
[3389.50 → 3390.34] that God
[3390.34 → 3391.40] is glorious
[3391.40 → 3392.26] because he is
[3392.26 → 3392.90] the creator
[3392.90 → 3394.68] and the sustainer
[3394.68 → 3395.44] of all things
[3395.44 → 3396.70] okay so
[3396.70 → 3397.26] but second
[3397.26 → 3398.28] the second aspect
[3398.28 → 3399.12] of God's glory
[3399.12 → 3399.62] we see
[3399.62 → 3401.54] is that he is
[3401.54 → 3402.68] our saviour
[3402.68 → 3404.06] okay that's the next one
[3404.06 → 3405.24] he is our saviour
[3405.24 → 3407.64] now the question is
[3407.64 → 3409.06] this is who God is
[3409.06 → 3410.76] right how may we worship
[3410.76 → 3411.50] this God
[3411.50 → 3413.64] who is the only true God
[3413.64 → 3414.88] worthy of our worship
[3414.88 → 3416.64] how can we worship him
[3416.64 → 3418.58] and we find that question
[3418.58 → 3421.12] in verse three
[3421.12 → 3424.28] who may ascend
[3424.28 → 3425.46] the mountain of the Lord
[3425.46 → 3427.20] who may stand
[3427.20 → 3429.06] in his holy place
[3429.06 → 3432.36] so let me ask you a question
[3432.36 → 3434.46] how many of you
[3434.46 → 3435.24] this morning
[3435.24 → 3435.92] said
[3435.92 → 3437.48] whether you know
[3437.48 → 3438.52] either just to yourself
[3438.52 → 3439.78] or maybe to your spouse
[3439.78 → 3440.54] or your children
[3440.54 → 3442.56] let's go to church
[3442.56 → 3444.74] or maybe you said
[3444.74 → 3446.36] I'm going to church today
[3446.36 → 3448.34] right probably all of us
[3448.34 → 3448.68] were here
[3448.68 → 3449.62] we probably said
[3449.62 → 3450.46] or thought
[3450.46 → 3451.80] that right
[3451.80 → 3453.46] and we frame it
[3453.46 → 3454.48] in the sense of
[3454.48 → 3456.12] we are going to church
[3456.12 → 3457.44] and most people
[3457.44 → 3458.14] talk that way
[3458.14 → 3458.96] I talk that way
[3458.96 → 3459.50] and I'm not here
[3459.50 → 3460.42] to tell you shouldn't
[3460.42 → 3462.30] but there is perhaps
[3462.30 → 3463.22] a more accurate
[3463.22 → 3464.52] way of saying
[3464.52 → 3465.46] what we are doing
[3465.46 → 3466.86] when we come to this building
[3466.86 → 3467.60] on Sunday morning
[3467.60 → 3469.08] and the answer
[3469.08 → 3470.14] is given here
[3470.14 → 3470.78] in verse three
[3470.78 → 3472.84] you are ascending
[3472.84 → 3474.16] the mountain of the Lord
[3474.16 → 3476.12] right
[3476.12 → 3477.38] when we gather together
[3477.38 → 3478.42] to worship God
[3478.42 → 3480.22] we're doing something
[3480.22 → 3481.60] much more profound
[3481.60 → 3482.82] in a certain sense
[3482.82 → 3483.86] than going to church
[3483.86 → 3485.48] you are ascending
[3485.48 → 3486.66] the mountain of the Lord
[3486.66 → 3487.90] you are coming to stand
[3487.90 → 3489.52] in his holy place
[3489.52 → 3491.86] and so maybe next Sunday
[3491.86 → 3492.64] you know
[3492.64 → 3493.56] you're getting ready for church
[3493.56 → 3494.34] you wake up
[3494.34 → 3495.18] instead of saying
[3495.18 → 3496.00] I'm going to church
[3496.00 → 3497.02] or let's go to church
[3497.02 → 3498.32] you can say
[3498.32 → 3499.90] let us ascend
[3499.90 → 3501.42] the mountain of the Lord
[3501.42 → 3503.56] sounds much more epic
[3503.56 → 3504.68] much more exciting
[3504.68 → 3505.32] than
[3505.32 → 3505.74] alright
[3505.74 → 3506.62] time to go to church
[3506.62 → 3509.18] but notice here
[3509.18 → 3510.70] that it is not everyone
[3510.70 → 3512.72] who gets to enjoy
[3512.72 → 3513.48] this privilege
[3513.48 → 3514.82] of ascending
[3514.82 → 3515.96] the mountain of the Lord
[3515.96 → 3517.62] you see
[3517.62 → 3518.86] because it is easy
[3518.86 → 3520.32] to go to church
[3520.32 → 3521.78] anybody
[3521.78 → 3522.00] anybody
[3522.00 → 3523.34] can go to church
[3523.34 → 3524.12] and really
[3524.12 → 3525.00] anybody can
[3525.00 → 3525.94] and is welcome
[3525.94 → 3527.06] to come to church
[3527.06 → 3528.90] and in fact
[3528.90 → 3529.72] in many countries
[3529.72 → 3530.30] and places
[3530.30 → 3531.30] today
[3531.30 → 3532.42] and around the world
[3532.42 → 3534.00] many people
[3534.00 → 3535.68] go to church
[3535.68 → 3536.90] you know
[3536.90 → 3538.24] and so not too long ago
[3538.24 → 3539.46] I re-watched the movie
[3539.46 → 3540.16] The Godfather
[3540.16 → 3541.54] and it's about
[3541.54 → 3542.96] these Italian mobsters
[3542.96 → 3543.70] you know
[3543.70 → 3544.94] and you know what
[3544.94 → 3546.78] they went to church
[3546.78 → 3548.14] did you know that
[3548.14 → 3549.22] all these scenes
[3549.22 → 3549.82] they're in churches
[3549.82 → 3550.42] all the time
[3550.42 → 3551.70] there's this one scene
[3551.70 → 3552.82] where Michael Corleone
[3552.82 → 3556.04] he's like the big boss guy
[3556.04 → 3557.40] he's in the church
[3557.40 → 3557.94] for the baptism
[3557.94 → 3558.60] of his nephew
[3558.60 → 3559.62] and he's the Godfather
[3559.62 → 3561.58] and you know
[3561.58 → 3562.16] the priest
[3562.16 → 3563.12] asks Michael
[3563.12 → 3565.14] part of the liturgy
[3565.14 → 3566.68] do you renounce evil
[3566.68 → 3568.04] I do
[3568.04 → 3569.46] as the scene
[3569.46 → 3569.94] is cutting
[3569.94 → 3570.88] to his men
[3570.88 → 3571.66] out in the city
[3571.66 → 3572.32] killing
[3572.32 → 3573.50] all the other
[3573.50 → 3574.72] mob bosses
[3574.72 → 3577.40] and it's not really
[3577.40 → 3578.12] that big of a deal
[3578.12 → 3578.96] right
[3578.96 → 3579.54] and you know
[3579.54 → 3579.98] it's kind of
[3579.98 → 3580.68] a bit of a rough
[3580.68 → 3581.56] Saturday night
[3581.56 → 3582.70] but they put away
[3582.70 → 3583.32] their enemies
[3583.32 → 3584.46] and then they come
[3584.46 → 3585.12] to church
[3585.12 → 3586.30] and all is good
[3586.30 → 3587.62] spiritually for them
[3587.62 → 3589.82] you see
[3589.82 → 3590.58] they are going
[3590.58 → 3591.30] to church
[3591.30 → 3593.08] but they are not
[3593.08 → 3594.30] actually ascending
[3594.30 → 3595.28] the mountain
[3595.28 → 3596.10] of the Lord
[3596.10 → 3596.88] right
[3596.88 → 3597.34] they are not
[3597.34 → 3598.38] standing in the
[3598.38 → 3599.18] holy place
[3599.18 → 3599.68] of God
[3599.68 → 3601.38] they're sitting there
[3601.38 → 3602.04] but they're not
[3602.04 → 3602.74] worshipping
[3602.74 → 3604.50] and this psalm
[3604.50 → 3605.08] is about
[3605.08 → 3606.62] who is a true
[3606.62 → 3607.92] worshipper
[3607.92 → 3608.52] of God
[3608.52 → 3610.08] and so the question
[3610.08 → 3610.94] is who may
[3610.94 → 3611.62] ascend
[3611.62 → 3612.66] the mountain
[3612.66 → 3613.22] of the Lord
[3613.22 → 3613.94] who can stand
[3613.94 → 3615.14] in his holy presence
[3615.14 → 3617.74] and the answer
[3617.74 → 3618.48] is given to us
[3618.48 → 3619.28] in verse 4
[3619.28 → 3621.44] the one
[3621.44 → 3622.42] who has
[3622.42 → 3623.46] clean hands
[3623.46 → 3624.46] and a pure heart
[3624.46 → 3625.10] who does not
[3625.10 → 3625.98] trust in an idol
[3625.98 → 3627.46] or swear by a false god
[3627.46 → 3629.40] you see
[3629.40 → 3630.20] the glory
[3630.20 → 3630.94] of God
[3630.94 → 3632.48] is that he is
[3632.48 → 3633.06] holy
[3633.06 → 3634.94] which means
[3634.94 → 3635.44] that there is
[3635.44 → 3636.22] no evil
[3636.22 → 3637.40] no sin
[3637.40 → 3639.04] or anything
[3639.04 → 3639.84] imperfect
[3639.84 → 3640.58] in him
[3640.58 → 3641.54] he is pure
[3641.54 → 3642.46] love
[3642.46 → 3643.96] pure goodness
[3643.96 → 3644.76] pure
[3644.76 → 3646.20] justice
[3646.20 → 3647.70] pure beauty
[3647.70 → 3648.98] pure majesty
[3648.98 → 3649.86] and we can go
[3649.86 → 3650.56] on and on
[3650.56 → 3652.56] God's glory
[3652.56 → 3653.96] is all of those
[3653.96 → 3654.60] things together
[3654.60 → 3655.44] that is the glory
[3655.44 → 3655.98] of God
[3655.98 → 3657.46] and that's why
[3657.46 → 3658.54] verse 4 says
[3658.54 → 3659.10] that the one
[3659.10 → 3659.96] who comes to
[3659.96 → 3660.86] this God
[3660.86 → 3662.56] is one
[3662.56 → 3663.06] who has
[3663.06 → 3663.52] a clean
[3663.52 → 3664.00] hands
[3664.00 → 3665.02] which means
[3665.02 → 3665.80] outwardly
[3665.80 → 3666.48] in our relationship
[3666.48 → 3667.22] with others
[3667.22 → 3668.30] we are right
[3668.30 → 3669.00] with one another
[3669.00 → 3670.44] and a pure
[3670.44 → 3670.92] heart
[3670.92 → 3671.38] which means
[3671.38 → 3671.80] your inward
[3671.80 → 3672.36] thoughts
[3672.36 → 3672.94] are pure
[3672.94 → 3674.74] one who does
[3674.74 → 3675.22] not trust
[3675.22 → 3675.74] an idol
[3675.74 → 3676.64] or swear
[3676.64 → 3677.18] by a false
[3677.18 → 3677.56] God
[3677.56 → 3678.14] which means
[3678.14 → 3679.02] they don't
[3679.02 → 3679.80] set their hearts
[3679.80 → 3680.20] on things
[3680.20 → 3680.86] that are empty
[3680.86 → 3681.78] there's nothing
[3681.78 → 3682.54] deceptive
[3682.54 → 3682.98] about that
[3682.98 → 3683.40] person
[3683.40 → 3686.72] now the question
[3686.72 → 3687.80] that I ask
[3687.80 → 3688.38] you
[3688.38 → 3689.16] and I have
[3689.16 → 3689.96] to ask myself
[3689.96 → 3690.50] is
[3690.50 → 3691.82] do any
[3691.82 → 3692.42] of us
[3692.42 → 3693.32] have perfectly
[3693.32 → 3694.16] clean hands
[3694.16 → 3696.68] do you have
[3696.68 → 3697.42] constantly
[3697.42 → 3698.14] a constantly
[3698.14 → 3699.06] pure heart
[3699.06 → 3700.50] do you ever
[3700.50 → 3701.22] trust
[3701.22 → 3702.14] in what is
[3702.14 → 3702.74] empty
[3702.74 → 3703.78] instead
[3703.78 → 3704.62] of God
[3704.62 → 3707.54] yes
[3707.54 → 3710.46] we do
[3710.46 → 3710.98] we do
[3710.98 → 3713.12] not one
[3713.12 → 3713.78] of us
[3713.78 → 3714.48] is holy
[3714.48 → 3716.14] and we
[3716.14 → 3716.70] need
[3716.70 → 3717.46] that holiness
[3717.46 → 3718.16] if we are
[3718.16 → 3718.54] to have
[3718.54 → 3719.20] this incredible
[3719.20 → 3719.84] gift
[3719.84 → 3720.82] of God
[3720.82 → 3721.36] dwelling
[3721.36 → 3722.00] with us
[3722.00 → 3722.48] of being
[3722.48 → 3723.16] our God
[3723.16 → 3724.36] so the question
[3724.36 → 3724.68] is
[3724.68 → 3725.42] how does
[3725.42 → 3725.98] the God
[3725.98 → 3726.56] of heaven
[3726.56 → 3727.38] and earth
[3727.38 → 3728.14] allow
[3728.14 → 3728.70] those who
[3728.70 → 3729.32] are sinners
[3729.32 → 3730.46] you and me
[3730.46 → 3731.76] to live
[3731.76 → 3732.36] with him
[3732.36 → 3733.50] to stand
[3733.50 → 3733.88] in his
[3733.88 → 3734.46] holy presence
[3734.46 → 3735.38] that's what
[3735.38 → 3735.88] the question
[3735.88 → 3736.46] is
[3736.46 → 3739.06] verses
[3739.06 → 3740.02] five and six
[3740.02 → 3740.52] give us
[3740.52 → 3741.02] an answer
[3741.02 → 3742.80] they will
[3742.80 → 3743.40] receive
[3743.40 → 3744.02] blessing
[3744.02 → 3745.12] from the
[3745.12 → 3745.46] Lord
[3745.46 → 3747.18] and vindication
[3747.18 → 3747.80] or it's the same
[3747.80 → 3748.56] word as righteousness
[3748.56 → 3750.54] from God
[3750.54 → 3751.76] their saviour
[3751.76 → 3753.64] such is the
[3753.64 → 3754.12] generation
[3754.12 → 3754.72] or the
[3754.72 → 3755.86] kinds of people
[3755.86 → 3757.06] of those
[3757.06 → 3757.76] who seek
[3757.76 → 3758.16] him
[3758.16 → 3759.54] who seek
[3759.54 → 3760.46] your face
[3760.46 → 3761.44] God of Jacob
[3761.44 → 3763.98] in other words
[3763.98 → 3764.36] when you
[3764.36 → 3764.98] come
[3764.98 → 3766.58] to worship
[3766.58 → 3767.10] God
[3767.10 → 3768.52] with a
[3768.52 → 3769.58] true desire
[3769.58 → 3770.14] to seek
[3770.14 → 3770.90] his face
[3770.90 → 3772.32] he blesses
[3772.32 → 3772.54] you
[3772.54 → 3774.32] he clothes
[3774.32 → 3775.32] you with
[3775.32 → 3776.00] his righteousness
[3776.00 → 3776.92] he grants
[3776.92 → 3777.60] you his
[3777.60 → 3778.04] spirit
[3778.04 → 3779.42] he makes
[3779.42 → 3780.20] you fit
[3780.20 → 3781.02] to come
[3781.02 → 3781.34] into
[3781.34 → 3782.52] his presence
[3782.52 → 3784.14] and so
[3784.14 → 3784.56] what David
[3784.56 → 3784.98] is saying
[3784.98 → 3785.38] here is
[3785.38 → 3785.84] that we
[3785.84 → 3786.70] can worship
[3786.70 → 3787.08] the one
[3787.08 → 3787.60] true God
[3787.60 → 3788.40] because God
[3788.40 → 3789.12] has first
[3789.12 → 3789.62] loved his
[3789.62 → 3789.96] people
[3789.96 → 3791.26] God has
[3791.26 → 3791.86] saved them
[3791.86 → 3792.18] he is
[3792.18 → 3792.80] their saviour
[3792.80 → 3793.94] he is
[3793.94 → 3794.60] the God
[3794.60 → 3795.20] of their
[3795.20 → 3795.74] salvation
[3795.74 → 3796.40] salvation
[3796.40 → 3796.90] and so
[3796.90 → 3797.22] when you
[3797.22 → 3797.60] go to
[3797.60 → 3798.08] church
[3798.08 → 3798.62] instead of
[3798.62 → 3798.92] saying
[3798.92 → 3799.36] I'm
[3799.36 → 3799.60] going
[3799.60 → 3799.78] to
[3799.78 → 3800.20] church
[3800.20 → 3800.88] you
[3800.88 → 3801.06] should
[3801.06 → 3801.20] be
[3801.20 → 3801.44] saying
[3801.44 → 3801.72] I'm
[3801.72 → 3801.92] going
[3801.92 → 3802.12] to
[3802.12 → 3802.64] ascend
[3802.64 → 3803.10] the
[3803.10 → 3803.60] mountain
[3803.60 → 3804.14] of the
[3804.14 → 3804.48] Lord
[3804.48 → 3805.04] in order
[3805.04 → 3806.08] to behold
[3806.08 → 3807.02] his
[3807.02 → 3807.96] face
[3807.96 → 3810.46] isn't that
[3810.46 → 3810.72] why you
[3810.72 → 3811.04] came this
[3811.04 → 3811.30] morning
[3811.30 → 3812.70] it is
[3812.70 → 3813.06] I know
[3813.06 → 3813.52] it is
[3813.52 → 3815.76] to ascend
[3815.76 → 3816.24] into the
[3816.24 → 3816.56] presence
[3816.56 → 3817.04] of God
[3817.04 → 3817.86] to behold
[3817.86 → 3818.42] the face
[3818.42 → 3818.88] of God
[3818.88 → 3819.34] Jesus
[3819.34 → 3819.68] said
[3819.68 → 3820.06] blessed
[3820.06 → 3820.58] is the
[3820.58 → 3820.84] pure
[3820.84 → 3821.22] in heart
[3821.22 → 3821.60] for they
[3821.60 → 3821.80] shall
[3821.80 → 3822.10] what
[3822.10 → 3823.64] see
[3823.64 → 3823.98] God
[3823.98 → 3826.94] and here
[3826.94 → 3827.40] in Psalm
[3827.40 → 3827.86] 24
[3827.86 → 3829.64] we are
[3829.64 → 3830.20] told that
[3830.20 → 3831.14] we can
[3831.14 → 3831.84] qualify
[3831.84 → 3832.86] to ascend
[3832.86 → 3833.14] the hill
[3833.14 → 3833.40] of the
[3833.40 → 3833.58] Lord
[3833.58 → 3834.10] because
[3834.10 → 3834.80] we are
[3834.80 → 3835.36] clothed
[3835.36 → 3835.94] in his
[3835.94 → 3836.40] righteousness
[3836.40 → 3837.56] in his
[3837.56 → 3837.90] goodness
[3837.90 → 3838.40] in his
[3838.40 → 3838.80] purity
[3838.80 → 3839.46] nothing
[3839.46 → 3840.02] that we
[3840.02 → 3840.46] have
[3840.46 → 3840.66] in
[3840.66 → 3841.22] ourselves
[3841.22 → 3842.66] and friends
[3842.66 → 3842.86] you know
[3842.86 → 3843.24] what that
[3843.24 → 3843.58] is what
[3843.58 → 3844.06] Christianity
[3844.06 → 3844.58] is all
[3844.58 → 3844.90] about
[3844.90 → 3845.90] right
[3845.90 → 3846.16] it's not
[3846.16 → 3846.36] about
[3846.36 → 3846.76] climbing
[3846.76 → 3847.00] the
[3847.00 → 3847.36] mountain
[3847.36 → 3848.24] it's not
[3848.24 → 3848.42] about
[3848.42 → 3848.78] trying to
[3848.78 → 3849.12] be a
[3849.12 → 3849.28] better
[3849.28 → 3849.82] person
[3849.82 → 3850.70] turning
[3850.70 → 3850.98] over
[3850.98 → 3851.36] a new
[3851.36 → 3851.76] leaf
[3851.76 → 3852.52] it's
[3852.52 → 3852.72] saying
[3852.72 → 3852.94] I
[3852.94 → 3853.40] can't
[3853.40 → 3853.76] climb
[3853.76 → 3854.00] this
[3854.00 → 3854.24] mountain
[3854.24 → 3854.44] I
[3854.44 → 3854.70] can't
[3854.70 → 3855.10] approach
[3855.10 → 3855.42] God
[3855.42 → 3855.62] my
[3855.62 → 3855.88] hands
[3855.88 → 3856.04] are
[3856.04 → 3856.38] dirty
[3856.38 → 3856.82] my
[3856.82 → 3857.08] heart
[3857.08 → 3857.24] is
[3857.24 → 3857.82] unclean
[3857.82 → 3859.46] I
[3859.46 → 3859.70] do
[3859.70 → 3859.94] put
[3859.94 → 3860.14] my
[3860.14 → 3860.48] trust
[3860.48 → 3860.66] in
[3860.66 → 3861.06] things
[3861.06 → 3861.38] other
[3861.38 → 3861.62] than
[3861.62 → 3862.02] God
[3862.02 → 3863.00] and
[3863.00 → 3863.20] I
[3863.20 → 3863.66] need
[3863.66 → 3863.94] the
[3863.94 → 3864.32] God
[3864.32 → 3864.50] who
[3864.50 → 3864.80] is
[3864.80 → 3865.02] my
[3865.02 → 3865.42] Saviour
[3865.42 → 3866.40] I
[3866.40 → 3866.70] need
[3866.70 → 3866.86] the
[3866.86 → 3867.30] forgiveness
[3867.30 → 3867.62] of
[3867.62 → 3867.84] my
[3867.84 → 3868.18] sins
[3868.18 → 3868.34] I
[3868.34 → 3868.48] need
[3868.48 → 3868.78] God
[3868.78 → 3868.94] to
[3868.94 → 3869.42] adopt
[3869.42 → 3869.62] me
[3869.62 → 3869.90] as
[3869.90 → 3870.12] his
[3870.12 → 3870.52] own
[3870.52 → 3871.10] to
[3871.10 → 3871.58] belong
[3871.58 → 3871.84] to
[3871.84 → 3872.12] him
[3872.12 → 3872.68] I
[3872.68 → 3873.00] need
[3873.00 → 3873.26] his
[3873.26 → 3873.72] grace
[3873.72 → 3874.38] and
[3874.38 → 3874.54] it's
[3874.54 → 3874.80] because
[3874.80 → 3875.00] of
[3875.00 → 3875.14] who
[3875.14 → 3875.46] he
[3875.46 → 3875.96] is
[3875.96 → 3876.50] that
[3876.50 → 3876.72] I

[3886.90 → 3887.16] Jesus
[3887.16 → 3887.44] even
[3887.44 → 3887.88] says
[3887.88 → 3888.08] in

[3903.92 → 3904.86] tells
[3904.86 → 3905.26] us
[3905.26 → 3905.46] that
[3905.46 → 3905.80] God
[3905.80 → 3906.00] is
[3906.00 → 3906.44] glorious
[3906.44 → 3907.04] because

[3907.86 → 3908.10] only
[3908.10 → 3908.30] is
[3908.30 → 3908.40] he
[3908.40 → 3908.54] our

[3913.96 → 3915.02] so
[3915.02 → 3915.60] look

[3915.80 → 3916.10] me
[3916.10 → 3916.58] at
[3916.58 → 3916.94] verse
[3916.94 → 3917.38] seven

[3920.78 → 3920.96] be
[3920.96 → 3921.36] lifted
[3921.36 → 3921.64] up
[3921.64 → 3921.78] you
[3921.78 → 3922.18] ancient
[3922.18 → 3922.56] doors
[3922.56 → 3922.80] that
[3922.80 → 3922.98] the
[3922.98 → 3923.32] king
[3923.32 → 3923.56] of
[3923.56 → 3924.12] glory
[3924.12 → 3925.04] may
[3925.04 → 3925.58] come
[3925.58 → 3926.04] in
[3926.04 → 3928.08] now
[3928.08 → 3928.20] I
[3928.20 → 3928.36] want
[3928.36 → 3928.46] to
[3928.46 → 3928.60] show
[3928.60 → 3928.72] you
[3928.72 → 3928.92] a
[3928.92 → 3929.22] photo
[3929.22 → 3930.06] that
[3930.06 → 3930.28] I
[3930.28 → 3930.76] took
[3930.76 → 3931.62] in
[3931.62 → 3932.10] Egypt
[3932.10 → 3932.66] it's
[3932.66 → 3932.78] on
[3932.78 → 3932.88] the
[3932.88 → 3933.10] next
[3933.10 → 3933.46] slide
[3933.46 → 3935.24] so
[3935.24 → 3935.46] this
[3935.46 → 3935.66] is
[3935.66 → 3935.82] an
[3935.82 → 3936.46] ancient
[3936.46 → 3937.24] Egyptian
[3937.24 → 3937.78] gate
[3937.78 → 3938.14] called
[3938.14 → 3938.30] a
[3938.30 → 3938.74] pylon
[3938.74 → 3939.14] gate
[3939.14 → 3939.46] it's
[3939.46 → 3939.70] a type
[3939.70 → 3939.82] of
[3939.82 → 3940.30] architecture
[3940.30 → 3941.38] and
[3941.38 → 3941.88] this
[3941.88 → 3942.42] particular
[3942.42 → 3942.98] wall and
[3942.98 → 3943.22] gate
[3943.22 → 3943.60] once
[3943.60 → 3944.08] surrounded
[3944.08 → 3944.56] the temple
[3944.56 → 3945.16] complex
[3945.16 → 3945.80] of Ramses
[3945.80 → 3946.34] the second
[3946.34 → 3947.52] pharaoh
[3947.52 → 3948.40] of Egypt
[3948.40 → 3949.68] now you
[3949.68 → 3950.34] look at this
[3950.34 → 3951.22] this huge wall
[3951.22 → 3952.34] this huge gate
[3952.34 → 3953.14] and you might wonder
[3953.14 → 3954.48] why is the door
[3954.48 → 3955.88] so big
[3955.88 → 3957.24] I mean
[3957.24 → 3958.18] it's much bigger
[3958.18 → 3959.32] than a person
[3959.32 → 3959.96] would need
[3959.96 → 3961.20] to go through it
[3961.20 → 3963.12] and the answer
[3963.12 → 3963.54] is
[3963.54 → 3964.32] it's so big
[3964.32 → 3964.96] because it's not
[3964.96 → 3965.46] for people
[3965.46 → 3967.08] it's for
[3967.08 → 3967.74] the king
[3967.74 → 3968.58] it is for
[3968.58 → 3969.82] the gods
[3969.82 → 3970.66] that the
[3970.66 → 3971.30] Egyptians
[3971.30 → 3972.86] worshipped
[3972.86 → 3973.94] you know
[3973.94 → 3974.60] and they were
[3974.60 → 3975.42] who were seen
[3975.42 → 3976.66] as big
[3976.66 → 3977.52] and lording it
[3977.52 → 3977.96] over you
[3977.96 → 3978.54] and mighty
[3978.54 → 3978.88] and so
[3978.88 → 3979.30] there's these
[3979.30 → 3979.90] big doors
[3979.90 → 3980.46] because this
[3980.46 → 3980.92] god
[3980.92 → 3981.66] who is the
[3981.66 → 3982.08] god of the
[3982.08 → 3982.38] sun
[3982.38 → 3982.62] or the
[3982.62 → 3982.90] god of
[3982.90 → 3983.28] the river
[3983.28 → 3983.96] it must
[3983.96 → 3984.50] be big
[3984.50 → 3984.76] we have to
[3984.76 → 3985.04] make a
[3985.04 → 3985.20] big
[3985.20 → 3985.54] door
[3985.54 → 3988.02] so there's
[3988.02 → 3988.52] the gate
[3988.52 → 3989.06] and then
[3989.06 → 3989.60] the cross
[3989.60 → 3989.98] piece
[3989.98 → 3990.30] you see
[3990.30 → 3990.64] that one
[3990.64 → 3990.86] it goes
[3990.86 → 3991.16] across
[3991.16 → 3991.64] the top
[3991.64 → 3992.90] you know
[3992.90 → 3993.18] what that's
[3993.18 → 3993.54] called
[3993.54 → 3995.50] what
[3995.50 → 3996.80] mental
[3996.80 → 3997.30] I don't
[3997.30 → 3997.50] know
[3997.50 → 3997.92] maybe
[3997.92 → 3998.54] but the
[3998.54 → 3998.82] head
[3998.82 → 4000.12] the head
[4000.12 → 4000.34] of the
[4000.34 → 4000.60] gate
[4000.60 → 4002.96] so
[4002.96 → 4003.52] when it
[4003.52 → 4003.92] says
[4003.92 → 4004.86] lift
[4004.86 → 4005.24] your
[4005.24 → 4006.38] heads

[4008.26 → 4008.66] that the

[4008.96 → 4009.18] glory
[4009.18 → 4009.64] may come
[4009.64 → 4009.82] in
[4009.82 → 4010.12] it is
[4010.12 → 4010.46] saying
[4010.46 → 4011.38] there is
[4011.38 → 4011.66] no
[4011.66 → 4012.40] headstone
[4012.40 → 4013.34] high
[4013.34 → 4013.88] enough
[4013.88 → 4014.86] for the
[4014.86 → 4015.42] king of
[4015.42 → 4015.82] glory
[4015.82 → 4016.44] to enter
[4016.44 → 4018.90] he is
[4018.90 → 4019.56] bigger
[4019.56 → 4020.84] he is
[4020.84 → 4021.44] greater
[4021.44 → 4021.98] than
[4021.98 → 4022.48] any
[4022.48 → 4022.88] other
[4022.88 → 4023.28] god
[4023.28 → 4023.82] he is
[4023.82 → 4024.04] the

[4318.20 → 4318.70] team
[4318.70 → 4318.96] comes
[4318.96 → 4319.14] up
[4319.14 → 4319.24] we
[4319.24 → 4319.36] can
[4319.36 → 4319.52] all
[4319.52 → 4320.06] stand
[4320.06 → 4320.28] and
[4320.28 → 4320.42] we'll
[4320.42 → 4320.66] sing
[4320.66 → 4320.80] our
[4320.80 → 4321.06] song
[4321.06 → 4321.20] of
[4321.20 → 4321.74] response

[4324.92 → 4326.08] of

[4354.30 → 4365.92] If they are new every morning, new every morning, great is your faithfulness, O Lord.
[4366.34 → 4370.40] Great is your faithfulness.
[4371.00 → 4377.40] Drift the slum of the Lord, never ceases.
[4377.82 → 4383.62] His blessings never come to the end.
[4383.62 → 4395.62] May I live every morning, live every morning, great is your faithfulness, O Lord.

[4415.62 → 4416.62] Amen.
[4416.62 → 4418.62] So we continue to worship the Lord.
[4418.62 → 4423.62] Now as we worship and come into his presence, we bring our tithes and our offerings.
[4423.62 → 4426.62] If you are a guest today, we're so glad you're here.
[4426.62 → 4429.62] Don't feel any obligation to give.
[4429.62 → 4435.62] But as the deacons come and collect our offering, we also have, in addition to our regular budget
[4435.62 → 4438.62] giving that we do, each Sunday, a designated offering.
[4438.62 → 4441.62] So today's offering is for Elude.
[4441.62 → 4447.62] It's a Canadian ministry here that provides, I think, curriculum, I can't read it.
[4447.62 → 4452.62] Yeah, so they provide, they do education ministry all around the world, provide curriculum and
[4452.62 → 4457.62] teachers and kind of Christian education for children all around the world.
[4457.62 → 4460.62] So that is our designated offering for today.
[4460.62 → 4461.62] Thank you.
[4461.62 → 4462.62] Thank you.
[4462.62 → 4463.62] Thank you.
[4490.62 → 4491.62] Thank you.

[4520.62 → 4521.62] Thank you.
[4550.62 → 4551.62] Thank you.
[4580.62 → 4583.62] both portion
[4583.62 → 4612.40] Let us go to the Lord in prayer
[4612.40 → 4615.88] to lift the needs of our church and the world.
[4616.44 → 4619.52] And we will conclude by saying together the Lord's Prayer,
[4619.68 → 4620.94] and we'll have the words on the screen.
[4621.58 → 4622.76] So please join me in prayer.
[4625.24 → 4627.24] O Lord, our Heavenly Father,
[4627.96 → 4632.38] you invite us, you beckon us to come to you in all times,
[4633.34 → 4635.26] at all times, in all places,
[4635.26 → 4637.60] because we belong to you.
[4638.40 → 4640.76] You know us intimately.
[4640.76 → 4643.06] You care for us.
[4643.94 → 4645.82] We are your sons and daughters,
[4645.98 → 4648.38] redeemed through the precious blood of your Son.
[4649.42 → 4650.78] And so we come to you now, Lord,
[4650.88 → 4653.34] submitting our needs, our desires,
[4653.50 → 4656.36] our plans to your will and to your power.
[4657.40 → 4659.78] We know that you are able to do far more
[4659.78 → 4661.52] than we can even ask or imagine
[4661.52 → 4663.26] for the good of your children
[4663.26 → 4666.16] and the glory of your name in all the earth.
[4667.04 → 4667.98] So Heavenly Father,
[4667.98 → 4671.94] we want to pray for your church.
[4672.36 → 4673.54] And we begin, Lord,
[4673.58 → 4674.92] by praying for our church,
[4675.04 → 4675.88] Latin or CRC.
[4676.86 → 4680.34] Lord, we pray for our elders and our deacons,
[4680.60 → 4682.62] whom you have called to watch over
[4682.62 → 4683.70] and shepherd your flock.
[4684.28 → 4686.54] And we thank you also for the many people
[4686.54 → 4688.56] who serve in various ministries,
[4688.70 → 4693.56] using their gifts to serve us, one another.
[4693.56 → 4695.60] And we thank you, Lord,
[4695.68 → 4697.84] even for each and every person
[4697.84 → 4698.88] whom you have called
[4698.88 → 4700.66] to be part of this congregation.
[4701.96 → 4704.86] We ask that you would nourish all of us daily
[4704.86 → 4705.66] through your word,
[4706.42 → 4708.72] strengthening us in the truth and grace
[4708.72 → 4710.24] of Christ Jesus
[4710.24 → 4712.06] by the power of the Spirit,
[4712.56 → 4714.26] so that through our ministry together,
[4714.42 → 4717.28] your word may take deep root amongst us
[4717.28 → 4718.20] and bear much fruit.
[4718.20 → 4721.08] And Lord, as we think about our church family,
[4721.48 → 4723.70] we mourn the death of Joe Kevin.
[4724.20 → 4724.98] And we pray, Lord,
[4725.02 → 4726.12] that you would be with
[4726.12 → 4728.24] and would you comfort his wife Nancy
[4728.24 → 4729.40] and all their family
[4729.40 → 4731.08] and all who mourn.
[4732.14 → 4733.14] Lord, we thank you
[4733.14 → 4735.68] that Joe knew you and loved you,
[4736.22 → 4737.30] was known by you,
[4737.30 → 4739.24] and he longed to be in his heavenly home.
[4739.88 → 4740.66] And we thank you
[4740.66 → 4742.18] that he is now with you in glory.
[4743.18 → 4745.10] And Lord, we pray for other churches
[4745.10 → 4746.90] in our classes,
[4747.08 → 4748.18] BC Southeast.
[4749.08 → 4751.32] We ask that you would guide your churches,
[4752.26 → 4752.96] the pastors,
[4753.24 → 4754.98] the councils of each of these churches
[4754.98 → 4755.92] throughout our classes.
[4756.68 → 4758.92] We pray that you would provide pastors
[4758.92 → 4760.74] for many churches that are vacant
[4760.74 → 4762.78] and looking for a pastor to come and serve.
[4763.66 → 4765.32] Lord, the harvest is plentiful,
[4765.46 → 4766.48] but the workers are few.
[4767.28 → 4769.66] And so we pray that you would raise up new leaders,
[4769.66 → 4772.40] put your calling on the hearts of those
[4772.40 → 4775.44] whom you would call into the pastoral ministry.
[4776.64 → 4778.26] Lord, we also pray that you would provide
[4778.26 → 4779.96] a new clerk for our classes
[4779.96 → 4781.72] to replace Len,
[4782.14 → 4784.30] who has served you in the church so well
[4784.30 → 4785.16] over many years.
[4786.14 → 4787.32] Lord, you know that need
[4787.32 → 4788.80] and his need to rest,
[4789.20 → 4790.52] and we ask that you would provide.
[4791.90 → 4794.86] Lord, not only do we pray for our church
[4794.86 → 4795.94] and churches in our classes,
[4796.16 → 4797.92] we pray for other churches in Ladder,
[4797.92 → 4800.04] specifically this morning
[4800.04 → 4801.38] for Lighthouse Church,
[4801.86 → 4802.54] Ladder Baptist,
[4803.36 → 4804.06] Cedar Park,
[4804.26 → 4804.80] River Valley.
[4805.48 → 4806.14] We ask, Lord,
[4806.20 → 4807.14] that you would bless them
[4807.14 → 4808.42] and that you would use them
[4808.42 → 4810.36] to build up your people in the faith
[4810.36 → 4812.68] and to reach out to others in our city
[4812.68 → 4814.32] who do not yet know you,
[4814.48 → 4815.22] the King of Glory.
[4816.26 → 4817.00] Finally, Lord,
[4817.06 → 4818.38] we pray for the situation
[4818.38 → 4822.10] of wildfires burning in our province.
[4823.22 → 4824.72] Lord, you have reminded us
[4824.72 → 4825.94] that the earth is yours
[4825.94 → 4827.06] and everything in it.
[4827.44 → 4828.18] You made it.
[4828.76 → 4829.42] You love it.
[4829.46 → 4830.02] It is good.
[4831.00 → 4832.32] And you, Lord,
[4832.42 → 4834.30] you have made us stewards
[4834.30 → 4835.82] of your world to care for it.
[4836.20 → 4836.48] So, Lord,
[4836.52 → 4837.74] we ask that you would be
[4837.74 → 4838.90] with the firefighters,
[4839.54 → 4840.42] help them in the work
[4840.42 → 4841.46] of controlling fires
[4841.46 → 4843.60] and helping to protect communities.
[4844.38 → 4844.56] Lord,
[4844.60 → 4845.24] would you grant them
[4845.24 → 4845.86] the strength,
[4846.48 → 4846.96] encouragement
[4846.96 → 4848.34] that they need
[4848.34 → 4849.82] and success in their work.
[4850.94 → 4851.50] And, Lord,
[4851.54 → 4852.60] we pray all of these things
[4852.60 → 4854.22] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4854.22 → 4855.70] who taught us to pray,
[4856.30 → 4857.08] saying together,
[4857.60 → 4858.70] Our Father,
[4859.02 → 4860.18] who art in heaven,
[4860.78 → 4862.18] hallowed be thy name.
[4862.80 → 4863.86] Thy kingdom come,
[4864.28 → 4865.50] thy will be done
[4865.50 → 4867.76] on earth as it is in heaven.
[4868.28 → 4869.64] Give us this day
[4869.64 → 4870.66] our daily bread
[4870.66 → 4872.00] and forgive us
[4872.00 → 4873.00] our trespasses
[4873.00 → 4874.62] as we forgive those
[4874.62 → 4876.48] who trespass against us.
[4876.86 → 4878.04] And lead us not
[4878.04 → 4878.90] into temptation,
[4879.46 → 4881.02] but deliver us from evil.
[4881.02 → 4882.98] For thine is the kingdom
[4882.98 → 4884.12] and the power
[4884.12 → 4885.14] and the glory
[4885.14 → 4886.94] forever and ever.
[4887.44 → 4887.84] Amen.
[4889.30 → 4890.50] Let's stand
[4890.50 → 4892.02] as you are able
[4892.02 → 4893.34] to receive
[4893.34 → 4894.70] the benediction.
[4895.44 → 4896.68] Stretch forth your hands.
[4898.94 → 4900.32] The Lord bless you
[4900.32 → 4901.88] and keep you.
[4902.58 → 4903.92] The Lord make his face
[4903.92 → 4904.90] to shine upon you
[4904.90 → 4905.70] and be gracious
[4905.70 → 4906.72] to you.
[4906.80 → 4907.62] The Lord lift
[4907.62 → 4908.84] his countenance upon you
[4908.84 → 4910.60] and give you his peace
[4910.60 → 4912.82] today and always.
[4913.38 → 4914.70] In the name of Jesus Christ
[4914.70 → 4915.14] our Lord.
[4915.34 → 4915.76] Amen.
[4916.72 → 4917.76] So remain standing
[4917.76 → 4918.32] and we'll sing
[4918.32 → 4919.24] one last song
[4919.24 → 4920.06] before we go.
[4920.42 → 4921.44] And please do join us
[4921.44 → 4922.36] for a time of fellowship
[4922.36 → 4923.16] and coffee
[4923.16 → 4924.42] in the fellowship hall
[4924.42 → 4925.12] through the doors.
[4925.12 → 4939.08] and we'll sing
