[323.34 --> 324.14]  Good morning.
[325.28 --> 326.58]  Welcome here this morning.
[327.14 --> 331.64]  We're glad that you're here, whether you're in person or whether you're joining us online.
[331.92 --> 334.46]  We're glad that we can be together to worship God this morning.
[335.96 --> 341.26]  After the service, we have refreshments in the fellowship hall straight through to the back.
[341.40 --> 343.58]  We'd love it if you would join us for that.
[344.40 --> 350.02]  And this morning, we're keeping things very simple because it's the August long weekend,
[350.40 --> 352.64]  and generally speaking, people are away.
[352.64 --> 352.76]  Thank you.
[353.56 --> 360.10]  So we're just, I'm the worship team, the worship leader, and we have Pastor Bert Slopster with us this morning.
[360.20 --> 363.00]  We're very glad to have him and his wife Diane with us.
[363.58 --> 365.70]  And I extend a special welcome to you.
[365.86 --> 366.88]  Thank you for being here.
[367.66 --> 373.68]  Just by way of a bit of introduction, Pastor Bert is a retired CRC pastor.
[373.68 --> 382.58]  He's been retired since 2017, but has been working quite hard helping out churches in between pastors.
[383.40 --> 386.04]  And the latest one was in Victoria.
[386.60 --> 393.42]  But he says that now he's just going to go and preach as needed and as requested,
[393.84 --> 398.64]  instead of doing any post-retirement hard work like that.
[398.64 --> 404.16]  So they plan to do some traveling, and they have recently moved from Abbotsford to Surrey
[404.16 --> 406.92]  and make their home at Fleetwood CRC.
[407.18 --> 408.38]  So welcome to both of you.
[412.04 --> 417.14]  We look forward very much to what you have to say to us this morning from Psalm 23
[417.14 --> 420.54]  as we continue our series in the Psalms this morning as well.
[420.54 --> 428.48]  Our call to worship this morning comes to us from Lamentations 3, verses 25 and 26.
[429.52 --> 435.04]  The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him.
[436.24 --> 440.94]  It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of our God.
[440.94 --> 449.78]  Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration based on Psalm 36, verses 5 to 9?
[451.92 --> 457.10]  We adore you, Father, Son, and Spirit, bowing our hearts before you.
[457.64 --> 461.42]  For your love reaches to the heavens and your faithfulness to the skies.
[462.24 --> 467.56]  Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep.
[467.56 --> 471.50]  You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.
[472.34 --> 474.82]  How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
[475.62 --> 478.48]  We take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[479.30 --> 482.18]  We feast on the abundance of your house.
[483.00 --> 485.68]  You give us to drink from your river of delights.
[486.44 --> 489.30]  For with you is the fountain of life.
[490.04 --> 492.22]  In your light we see light.
[492.22 --> 497.40]  May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you.
[498.20 --> 501.06]  We adore you, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[501.60 --> 501.84]  Amen.
[503.40 --> 505.00]  Please rise for God's greeting.
[508.38 --> 510.52]  From Ephesians 6, verse 4,
[510.98 --> 516.36]  Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
[517.18 --> 518.44]  Please greet one another.
[518.60 --> 519.66]  Take a moment to do that.
[519.66 --> 523.18]  And if you are feeling comfortable and you want to move forward,
[523.26 --> 524.64]  I feel kind of alone here,
[524.76 --> 527.38]  but up to you if you want to move forward a little bit.
[527.38 --> 527.62]  Thank you.
[549.66 --> 558.54]  Take a moment to do that.
[558.66 --> 559.42]  Please reach Sara.
[559.42 --> 559.54]  Take a moment to do that.
[559.58 --> 559.98]  You can romanque.
[559.98 --> 560.30]  Turn be prayer.
[560.30 --> 561.22]  Therefore, take a moment to be with us.
[561.22 --> 561.66]  Bye.
[561.66 --> 563.44]  Take a moment to do that.
[563.44 --> 563.78]  Bye.
[563.78 --> 563.86]  Bye.
[563.86 --> 563.94]  Come on.
[563.94 --> 564.26]  Bye.
[565.02 --> 565.54]  "'Viszę'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'n'.
[565.54 --> 583.90]  Oh, worship the King, all glorious above.
[583.90 --> 589.92]  Oh, gratefully sing His power and His love.
[589.92 --> 596.90]  Our shield, defender, the agent of days.
[597.32 --> 604.58]  Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.
[607.10 --> 612.26]  Oh, tell of His might and sin of His grace.
[612.70 --> 617.90]  Whose robe is the light, His canopy's face.
[617.90 --> 624.88]  His chair is a wrap, the deep thunderclouds form.
[625.16 --> 630.84]  And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
[634.60 --> 640.38]  Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite.
[640.86 --> 646.32]  It breathes in the air, it shines in the light.
[646.32 --> 653.30]  It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain.
[653.30 --> 660.30]  And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.
[660.30 --> 669.54]  Frail children of dust and feeble as frail.
[669.54 --> 675.46]  In you do we trust, nor find you to fail.
[675.92 --> 682.80]  Your mercy is how tender, how firm to the end.
[683.30 --> 689.76]  Our maker, defender, redeemer and friend.
[689.76 --> 700.82]  Now if the kids are here and they know the actions to this, or any of you want to do the actions, you're welcome.
[700.82 --> 707.60]  He's got the whole world in His hands.
[707.60 --> 709.60]  He's got the wind and the rain.
[709.60 --> 714.60]  In His hands, He's got the wind and the rain.
[714.60 --> 730.60]  In His hands, He's got the wind and the rain.
[730.60 --> 742.42]  In His hands, He's got the little tiny baby.
[742.60 --> 746.60]  In His hands, He's got the little tiny baby.
[746.60 --> 752.26]  In His hands, He's got the whole world in His hands.
[752.26 --> 769.06]  He's got you and me, brother. In his hands, he's got you and me, sister. In his hands, he's got everybody here. In his hands, he's got the whole world in his hands.
[769.06 --> 788.24]  He's got the whole world in his hands. You may be seated.
[792.00 --> 798.86]  Our first scripture reading this morning is from Colossians 1, verses 15 to 20.
[799.06 --> 806.30]  The sun is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
[807.20 --> 817.98]  For in him, all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[818.78 --> 822.06]  All things have been created through him and for him.
[822.06 --> 827.30]  He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[828.12 --> 830.80]  And he is the head of the body, the church.
[831.56 --> 837.92]  He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[837.92 --> 847.00]  For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[847.66 --> 855.46]  whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.
[855.46 --> 881.66]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[881.66 --> 911.64]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[911.64 --> 929.64]  Underneath me, all around me, is the current of thy love.
[929.64 --> 939.64]  Leading on earth, leading on earth, leading on earth, leading on earth,
[939.64 --> 949.80]  To thy glorious rest of life.
[949.80 --> 960.80]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[960.80 --> 969.80]  Spread his praise from shore to shore,
[969.80 --> 979.80]  How he loves us, ever loves us,
[979.80 --> 988.80]  Changes never, never more.
[988.80 --> 999.62]  How he watches, or his loved ones,
[999.62 --> 1008.80]  Died to call them all his own,
[1008.80 --> 1018.80]  How for them he's interceding,
[1018.80 --> 1027.80]  Watching o'er them from the throne.
[1027.80 --> 1039.80]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1039.80 --> 1048.80]  Love of every love of the best,
[1048.80 --> 1058.80]  Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
[1058.80 --> 1059.80]  Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
[1059.80 --> 1068.80]  Tis a haven sweet of rest,
[1068.80 --> 1078.80]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1078.80 --> 1087.80]  Tis a haven not hands to me,
[1087.80 --> 1097.80]  And it lifts me up to glory,
[1097.80 --> 1108.80]  For it lifts me up to thee.
[1108.80 --> 1118.80]  For our time of confession, I'm going to read from Colossians 1,
[1118.80 --> 1122.80]  Verses 21 to 23a.
[1122.80 --> 1127.80]  And this really is the gospel in a nutshell.
[1127.80 --> 1130.80]  Once you were alienated from God,
[1130.80 --> 1132.80]  And were enemies in your minds,
[1132.80 --> 1134.80]  Because of your evil behavior.
[1134.80 --> 1138.80]  But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body,
[1138.80 --> 1140.80]  Through death,
[1140.80 --> 1142.80]  To present you holy in his sight,
[1142.80 --> 1146.80]  Without blemish, and free from accusation.
[1146.80 --> 1148.80]  If you continue in your faith,
[1148.80 --> 1150.80]  Established and firm,
[1150.80 --> 1155.80]  And do not move from the hope held out in the gospel.
[1155.80 --> 1161.80]  Would you please join me in this prayer of confession together?
[1161.80 --> 1169.80]  Lord, we confess that we are still quick to revert to old sinful habits,
[1169.80 --> 1173.80]  In our thoughts, words, and deeds.
[1173.80 --> 1179.80]  We deeply regret hurting you, the one who loves us most.
[1179.80 --> 1184.80]  We are sorry for hurting those whom you give us to love.
[1184.80 --> 1188.80]  The reminder that you have made us holy,
[1188.80 --> 1190.80]  Increases our love for you,
[1190.80 --> 1194.80]  And renews our desire to live justly,
[1194.80 --> 1196.80]  To love mercy,
[1196.80 --> 1198.80]  And to walk humbly with you.
[1198.80 --> 1201.80]  Increase our love, we pray.
[1201.80 --> 1202.80]  Amen.
[1202.80 --> 1208.80]  Our words of assurance are beautiful,
[1208.80 --> 1211.80]  Coming from 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17.
[1211.80 --> 1215.80]  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[1215.80 --> 1217.80]  The new creation has come,
[1217.80 --> 1219.80]  The old has gone,
[1219.80 --> 1221.80]  The new is here.
[1221.80 --> 1239.80]  Mine are days that God has numbered,
[1239.80 --> 1244.80]  I was made to walk with you.
[1244.80 --> 1249.80]  Yet I look for worldly treasure,
[1249.80 --> 1254.80]  And forsake the King of kings.
[1254.80 --> 1260.80]  But mine is hope in my Redeemer,
[1260.80 --> 1265.80]  Though I fall, His love is sure,
[1265.80 --> 1271.80]  For Christ has paid for every failing,
[1271.80 --> 1277.80]  I am His forevermore.
[1277.80 --> 1284.80]  My chains are gone, I've been set free,
[1284.80 --> 1291.80]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me,
[1291.80 --> 1298.80]  And like a flood, His mercy rains,
[1298.80 --> 1305.80]  Unending love, amazing praise.
[1305.80 --> 1311.80]  And mine are keys to Zion's city,
[1311.80 --> 1316.80]  Where beside the King of all,
[1316.80 --> 1322.80]  For there my heart has found its treasure,
[1322.80 --> 1328.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1328.80 --> 1334.80]  And mine are keys to Zion's city,
[1334.80 --> 1339.80]  Where beside the King I walk,
[1339.80 --> 1345.80]  For there my heart has found its treasure,
[1345.80 --> 1348.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1348.80 --> 1351.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1351.80 --> 1360.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1360.80 --> 1364.80]  The kids are now invited to go to Kids Life,
[1364.80 --> 1368.80]  And have some time in lessons,
[1368.80 --> 1370.80]  And with their teacher,
[1370.80 --> 1374.80]  And may you be blessed as you go.
[1374.80 --> 1381.80]  And now I invite Pastor Burt to come forward as well.
[1381.80 --> 1388.80]  Well, good morning everyone.
[1388.80 --> 1402.80]  Good morning.
[1402.80 --> 1403.80]  Good morning.
[1403.80 --> 1405.80]  Good morning.
[1405.80 --> 1406.80]  Good morning.
[1406.80 --> 1411.80]  I promised someone this week that I would put in a plug for Canadian blood services.
[1411.80 --> 1414.80]  I was donating blood on Thursday, which I do regularly.
[1414.80 --> 1419.80]  And the lady asked me, so what are you doing this weekend?
[1419.80 --> 1421.80]  And I said, well, I'm working on Sunday morning.
[1421.80 --> 1423.80]  She says, are you a pastor?
[1423.80 --> 1425.80]  I said, yeah, I'm a pastor.
[1425.80 --> 1430.80]  She looked at my name and thought, Reformed?
[1430.80 --> 1431.80]  I said, yeah.
[1431.80 --> 1432.80]  She said, well, I'm also a believer.
[1432.80 --> 1433.80]  I'm a Mennonite.
[1433.80 --> 1436.80]  So she asked me, what are you preaching on Sunday morning?
[1436.80 --> 1438.80]  And I said, Psalm 23.
[1438.80 --> 1439.80]  Oh.
[1439.80 --> 1446.80]  Looking as though, okay, you know, everybody knows that one, right?
[1446.80 --> 1448.80]  But I said, with a twist.
[1448.80 --> 1453.80]  So she asked me what the twist was, and I told her, and I'll tell you later, of course.
[1453.80 --> 1458.80]  And I said, yeah, so that's what I'm doing, and I'm telling you that's what I'm doing.
[1458.80 --> 1462.80]  And in the meantime, I did promise her that I put in a plug for Canadian blood services.
[1462.80 --> 1464.80]  If you are able to donate blood, you should.
[1464.80 --> 1466.80]  It's a good thing to do.
[1466.80 --> 1467.80]  There.
[1467.80 --> 1468.80]  Okay.
[1468.80 --> 1473.80]  Now, when she asked me, next time I come, I said, I did it.
[1473.80 --> 1475.80]  Let me pray with you before we begin reading.
[1475.80 --> 1480.80]  Thank you, Lord, for this beautiful Sunday morning, and thank you for your word, which
[1480.80 --> 1482.80]  is a light for our path.
[1482.80 --> 1489.80]  And as we, Lord, look at a very familiar psalm this morning, help us to see its truth in
[1489.80 --> 1491.80]  a brand new way.
[1491.80 --> 1497.80]  So open our hearts and minds to listen and to hear what you have to say to us.
[1497.80 --> 1500.80]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[1500.80 --> 1504.80]  So Psalm 23 is a psalm of David.
[1504.80 --> 1507.80]  You probably all know it by heart anyway.
[1507.80 --> 1509.80]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[1509.80 --> 1511.80]  I lack nothing.
[1511.80 --> 1514.80]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[1514.80 --> 1517.80]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[1517.80 --> 1520.80]  He restores my soul.
[1520.80 --> 1525.80]  He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.
[1525.80 --> 1530.80]  Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil.
[1530.80 --> 1531.80]  For you are with me.
[1531.80 --> 1535.80]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[1535.80 --> 1539.80]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[1539.80 --> 1541.80]  You anoint my head with oil.
[1541.80 --> 1543.80]  My cup overflows.
[1543.80 --> 1549.80]  Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
[1549.80 --> 1553.80]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1553.80 --> 1555.80]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1555.80 --> 1557.80]  Praise be to God.
[1557.80 --> 1564.80]  So this morning, congregation, we visit with an old and familiar friend.
[1564.80 --> 1580.80]  A friend that during its journey through the ages of humankind has stilled more pain than all of our doctors and given more peace to the human race than all the wisdom of the world.
[1580.80 --> 1586.80]  You know this old friend, of course, as Psalm 23.
[1586.80 --> 1593.80]  It was composed by King David, King of Israel, who used to be a shepherd himself.
[1593.80 --> 1611.80]  And so one day while he was caring for his sheep, perhaps during some quiet moment conducive to such reflection, perhaps with heart rate still winding down after a heart pounding confrontation with a predator that could have gone either way but went his.
[1611.80 --> 1622.80]  And so, who knows exactly when or why, but at some point, it struck David, he also had a shepherd.
[1622.80 --> 1635.80]  Which was such an awesome notion that he wrote a song about it that some would argue was and is the Bible's best selling song number one on God's playlist.
[1635.80 --> 1640.80]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[1640.80 --> 1643.80]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[1643.80 --> 1651.80]  In fact, because there's none better, he immediately added the words, I lack nothing.
[1651.80 --> 1658.80]  Personally, I cannot remember a time when I did not know this song.
[1658.80 --> 1661.80]  Can you?
[1661.80 --> 1672.80]  Even people who don't know any other part of the Bible by heart, who could not find any other Bible verse of their life depended on it, know this.
[1672.80 --> 1679.80]  Who can forget those old pictures from our Sunday school and vacation Bible school days?
[1679.80 --> 1682.80]  Cotton, batten and all.
[1682.80 --> 1686.80]  Jesus, the good shepherd, tending his little sheep.
[1686.80 --> 1697.80]  It is a psalm of and for children, expressing a childlike trust in God's ability to protect us and provide for us.
[1697.80 --> 1703.80]  The Sunday school teacher once asked her class of five-year-olds if anyone could recite the entire 23rd Psalm.
[1703.80 --> 1706.80]  Well, one little girl immediately raised her hands.
[1706.80 --> 1712.80]  Somewhat skeptical, the teacher asked if she could really quote the whole psalm.
[1712.80 --> 1718.80]  Well, the little girl came to the front of the class, faced the class, made a perky little curtsy and said,
[1718.80 --> 1723.80]  The Lord is my shepherd, that's all I want.
[1723.80 --> 1728.80]  Then she curtsied again and sat down.
[1728.80 --> 1731.80]  Well, she certainly caught the heart of the psalm.
[1731.80 --> 1736.80]  And the truth that while a lot of people know and love the words of this song, it doesn't mean a thing.
[1736.80 --> 1739.80]  Unless you know the shepherd.
[1739.80 --> 1745.80]  The Lord is my shepherd, that's all I want.
[1745.80 --> 1750.80]  But how well do we really know the shepherd?
[1750.80 --> 1755.80]  Do we really know what kind of shepherd is the Lord?
[1755.80 --> 1758.80]  Well, the familiar song goes on.
[1758.80 --> 1761.80]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[1761.80 --> 1763.80]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[1763.80 --> 1765.80]  He refreshes my soul.
[1765.80 --> 1767.80]  It's so restful.
[1767.80 --> 1769.80]  So reassuring.
[1769.80 --> 1773.80]  Sheep should not drink from dangerous, swift-flowing rivers.
[1773.80 --> 1777.80]  But being sheep, they don't always know better.
[1777.80 --> 1784.80]  This shepherd knows and finds just the right spot for the sheep to rest, to be restored.
[1784.80 --> 1790.80]  He leads me in right paths for his name's sake.
[1790.80 --> 1796.80]  Then the pleasant memories of childhood and youth fade.
[1796.80 --> 1807.80]  Even though I walk through the darkest valley, or as the more familiar version puts it, even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[1807.80 --> 1811.80]  We look down a gradually darkening tunnel toward the end of life.
[1811.80 --> 1819.80]  And there to meet us is not the darkening abyss of death, but once again, the shepherd.
[1819.80 --> 1822.80]  I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[1822.80 --> 1826.80]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[1826.80 --> 1840.80]  How often I have experienced as a pastor that when life draws to a close for someone, and it's their turn to walk through the valley, they almost always reach out for this old friend.
[1840.80 --> 1855.80]  Not just because they know this psalm by heart, but because it dares to speak about the end, about that dark valley, and names it as a place where the good shepherd comforts us and holds us.
[1855.80 --> 1861.80]  It is a psalm I have read so often at a deathbed, ending as it does with those comforting words,
[1861.80 --> 1864.80]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1864.80 --> 1870.80]  And Psalm 23 is hardly ever not invited to speak a word or two over a grave.
[1870.80 --> 1876.80]  And so here is a song for the beginning of life, for every part of life, right up to the end.
[1876.80 --> 1883.80]  Good, old, reassuring, familiar since childhood, Psalm 23.
[1883.80 --> 1892.80]  Whenever in this life we find ourselves in some dry desert, tossing and turning in some raging torrent,
[1892.80 --> 1901.80]  This old friend reminds us of the green pastures, the quiet waters, and thereby restores our souls.
[1901.80 --> 1909.80]  Whenever we wander without direction or meaning, there is good old Psalm 23 to point out the right paths for his namesake.
[1909.80 --> 1917.80]  Whenever life makes us wonder if God is there for us, if he cares, it is Psalm 23 that puts comforting arms around us,
[1917.80 --> 1923.80]  And reassures us of a God who makes, leads, restores, comforts, prepares, anoints,
[1923.80 --> 1929.80]  So that in darkness or light, life or death, we might dwell with God forever.
[1929.80 --> 1932.80]  Good old familiar, 23.
[1932.80 --> 1933.80]  Right?
[1933.80 --> 1943.80]  Until you get to verse 6.
[1943.80 --> 1952.80]  Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
[1952.80 --> 1959.80]  And there is something here that almost every Bible translation gets wrong.
[1959.80 --> 1967.80]  As anyone who knows more than one language knows, and that includes, I suspect, many of us,
[1967.80 --> 1974.80]  When you translate from one language to another, a word often loses something of its original meaning.
[1974.80 --> 1981.80]  So, surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
[1981.80 --> 1983.80]  Goodness.
[1983.80 --> 1985.80]  Well, that's not hard to understand.
[1985.80 --> 1989.80]  It is the name for all the benefits of God's presence.
[1989.80 --> 1991.80]  And love?
[1991.80 --> 1993.80]  There is a bit more to that.
[1993.80 --> 2001.80]  The Hebrew word used as one especially loved by the prophets, often translated rather in English,
[2001.80 --> 2005.80]  As steadfast love or loving kindness or mercy.
[2005.80 --> 2010.80]  A word expressing how faithful God remains even when his people are not.
[2010.80 --> 2017.80]  A word almost always spoken in the same breath as the word covenant.
[2017.80 --> 2022.80]  And covenant, of course, is what the Bible calls the relationship between God and his people.
[2022.80 --> 2028.80]  That relationship that begins with this simple promise of God and begins with God's promise,
[2028.80 --> 2031.80]  Because as sinful people it could hardly begin with us.
[2031.80 --> 2034.80]  I will take you as my own people.
[2034.80 --> 2040.80]  And in spite of everything I will be your God and you will be my people.
[2040.80 --> 2044.80]  Except that in Psalm 23 it's put in these words,
[2044.80 --> 2048.80]  I will be your shepherd and you will be my flock.
[2048.80 --> 2054.80]  But now here is the word that almost every translation gets wrong.
[2054.80 --> 2058.80]  And it changes the whole tone of this Psalm.
[2058.80 --> 2062.80]  The word we translate as follow.
[2062.80 --> 2066.80]  Goodness and love will follow me.
[2066.80 --> 2074.80]  Except that every other instance in the Old Testament where you find that same Hebrew word,
[2074.80 --> 2078.80]  It is translated as pursue.
[2078.80 --> 2081.80]  Follow or pursue.
[2081.80 --> 2084.80]  There is a world of difference there.
[2084.80 --> 2087.80]  In Exodus 14 verses 8 and 9 for example,
[2087.80 --> 2094.80]  Moses wrote that the chariots of Pharaoh pursued the children of Israel to the sea.
[2094.80 --> 2099.80]  In Psalm 18 verse 37 in celebration of one of his military victories,
[2099.80 --> 2100.80]  David sings,
[2100.80 --> 2104.80]  I pursued my enemies and overtook them.
[2104.80 --> 2107.80]  In Lamentations 4 verse 19,
[2107.80 --> 2114.80]  The prophet Jeremiah laments the fact that our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky.
[2114.80 --> 2119.80]  They chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.
[2119.80 --> 2127.80]  Surely, goodness and love will pursue me all the days of my life.
[2127.80 --> 2133.80]  Just when you thought you knew this familiar song and this good shepherd pretty well,
[2133.80 --> 2137.80]  Well, this creates a ripple upon the quiet waters, doesn't it?
[2137.80 --> 2140.80]  Here we are, plodding our way through life.
[2140.80 --> 2143.80]  And oh yes, what's that behind me?
[2143.80 --> 2144.80]  Who's that behind me?
[2144.80 --> 2148.80]  Oh, just goodness and love tagging along as usual.
[2148.80 --> 2149.80]  No.
[2149.80 --> 2151.80]  No, no, no.
[2151.80 --> 2156.80]  Your beauty and love,
[2156.80 --> 2157.80]  You know,
[2157.80 --> 2159.80]  Good love,
[2159.80 --> 2160.80]  Your beauty and love,
[2160.80 --> 2163.80]  Your beauty and love chase after me every day of my life.
[2163.80 --> 2164.80]  Goodness and love,
[2164.80 --> 2166.80]  Chasing me,
[2166.80 --> 2168.80]  Laying in wait for me,
[2168.80 --> 2170.80]  Running to overtake me.
[2170.80 --> 2175.98]  Francis Thompson catches the idea so well in his poem
[2175.98 --> 2178.00]  The Hound of Heaven
[2178.00 --> 2182.06]  I fled him down the nights and down the days
[2182.06 --> 2184.14]  I fled him down the arches of the years
[2184.14 --> 2187.78]  I fled him down the labyrinth ways of my own mind
[2187.78 --> 2191.88]  and in the midst of tears I hid from him
[2191.88 --> 2195.76]  from those strong feet that followed after
[2195.76 --> 2198.40]  followed after, chased me
[2198.40 --> 2204.64]  No matter how well you think you know the Good Shepherd of Psalm 23
[2204.64 --> 2207.36]  you do not really know him
[2207.36 --> 2211.06]  until you realize that he is a pursuer
[2211.06 --> 2215.76]  There is a difference between being followed and pursued
[2215.76 --> 2218.80]  There is a difference between looking back over your shoulder
[2218.80 --> 2221.46]  and finding dear old predictable goodness
[2221.46 --> 2222.70]  hand in hand with love
[2222.70 --> 2225.64]  casually strolling along up the hill behind you
[2225.64 --> 2227.86]  and being pursued
[2227.86 --> 2232.06]  chased, hunted, tracked, jumped
[2232.06 --> 2235.80]  by a breathless goodness and love
[2235.80 --> 2240.34]  The Lord is my shepherd, we say
[2240.34 --> 2243.96]  The shepherd leads down to the quiet waters
[2243.96 --> 2245.88]  the green pastures
[2245.88 --> 2249.56]  knows where to find the restful streams that refresh us
[2249.56 --> 2252.82]  But then Jesus told us about the shepherd
[2252.82 --> 2256.32]  who when just one stupid sheep strayed from the fold
[2256.32 --> 2258.46]  left the 99 to their own devices
[2258.46 --> 2261.10]  in the open country and went after
[2261.10 --> 2263.44]  pursued the one lost sheep
[2263.44 --> 2264.90]  until he found it
[2264.90 --> 2267.72]  Goodness and love
[2267.72 --> 2269.46]  will pursue me
[2269.46 --> 2271.76]  all the days of my life
[2271.76 --> 2275.56]  You have done all you can do for that boy
[2275.56 --> 2276.60]  Fringe told his parents
[2276.60 --> 2278.36]  There are limits to what parents can do
[2278.36 --> 2279.80]  He is an adult now
[2279.80 --> 2282.04]  Time for him to stand up on his own
[2282.04 --> 2284.24]  Let him go, just try to forget about it
[2284.24 --> 2285.48]  It is his problem
[2285.48 --> 2286.50]  No
[2286.50 --> 2299.64]  Most sheep are content with an occasional green pasture
[2299.64 --> 2301.38]  A quiet brook
[2301.38 --> 2302.82]  here or there
[2302.82 --> 2304.78]  I have other sheep
[2304.78 --> 2306.00]  said the good shepherd once
[2306.00 --> 2307.10]  that are not other sheep
[2307.10 --> 2308.40]  and I must bring them also
[2308.40 --> 2311.86]  And when this pursuing shepherd finds the lost
[2311.86 --> 2313.30]  he puts that sheep on his shoulders
[2313.30 --> 2315.58]  and breathlessly returns to the fold
[2315.58 --> 2316.64]  I found him
[2316.64 --> 2317.78]  I found him
[2317.78 --> 2319.92]  I found my sheep that was lost
[2319.92 --> 2322.18]  Come, rejoice with me
[2322.18 --> 2325.70]  And Jesus said
[2325.70 --> 2327.10]  I am the good shepherd
[2327.10 --> 2330.86]  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
[2330.86 --> 2332.56]  And he did
[2332.56 --> 2335.44]  The good shepherd became the lamb of God
[2335.44 --> 2337.20]  who takes away the sin of the world
[2337.20 --> 2338.48]  because, you see
[2338.48 --> 2340.00]  there is no limit
[2340.00 --> 2341.46]  to how far
[2341.46 --> 2343.32]  the good shepherd will go
[2343.32 --> 2344.98]  in his pursuit
[2344.98 --> 2348.86]  Because the good shepherd is also
[2348.86 --> 2350.16]  the hound of heaven
[2350.16 --> 2352.64]  even unto death
[2352.64 --> 2355.42]  The good shepherd, Jesus
[2355.42 --> 2357.04]  God's anointed one
[2357.04 --> 2358.96]  You have anointed my head with oil
[2358.96 --> 2360.42]  comes to Jerusalem
[2360.42 --> 2361.74]  spreads the table
[2361.74 --> 2362.96]  in the midst of his friends
[2362.96 --> 2364.06]  and his enemies
[2364.06 --> 2366.64]  fills a cup to overflowing
[2366.64 --> 2368.42]  with his own life
[2368.42 --> 2370.58]  and dies on the cross
[2370.58 --> 2371.36]  for all of us
[2371.36 --> 2372.20]  who, like sheep
[2372.20 --> 2373.98]  have gone astray
[2373.98 --> 2376.44]  Preacher
[2376.44 --> 2377.96]  and Professor
[2377.96 --> 2378.62]  William Willimon
[2378.62 --> 2379.80]  tells
[2379.80 --> 2381.00]  this story
[2381.00 --> 2381.48]  of a man
[2381.48 --> 2382.30]  that he once knew
[2382.30 --> 2384.52]  whom everybody spoke of
[2384.52 --> 2385.16]  as a mean
[2385.16 --> 2386.06]  resentful
[2386.06 --> 2386.84]  and bitter
[2386.84 --> 2387.46]  old goat
[2387.46 --> 2390.24]  Some had a hard time
[2390.24 --> 2390.82]  blaming him
[2390.82 --> 2391.84]  for who he was
[2391.84 --> 2393.90]  because his beloved wife
[2393.90 --> 2394.40]  had died
[2394.40 --> 2394.98]  giving birth
[2394.98 --> 2395.84]  to their one child
[2395.84 --> 2396.38]  a daughter
[2396.38 --> 2397.84]  who also died
[2397.84 --> 2398.80]  soon afterwards
[2398.80 --> 2400.02]  from complications
[2400.02 --> 2402.96]  Never went to church
[2402.96 --> 2403.82]  after that anymore
[2403.82 --> 2406.34]  Never had anything to do
[2406.34 --> 2406.84]  with anybody
[2406.84 --> 2407.24]  really
[2407.24 --> 2408.90]  And so
[2408.90 --> 2410.62]  when in his late 60s
[2410.62 --> 2411.34]  they carried him
[2411.34 --> 2412.16]  out of his apartment
[2412.16 --> 2413.32]  and over to the hospital
[2413.32 --> 2414.00]  to die
[2414.00 --> 2416.70]  no flowers were sent
[2416.70 --> 2418.48]  He went there
[2418.48 --> 2419.06]  to die
[2419.06 --> 2419.82]  alone
[2419.82 --> 2422.50]  But there was this nurse
[2422.50 --> 2423.44]  a student still
[2423.44 --> 2424.12]  in training
[2424.12 --> 2424.82]  who did not
[2424.82 --> 2426.46]  yet know
[2426.46 --> 2427.08]  what they teach
[2427.08 --> 2427.86]  any caregiver
[2427.86 --> 2428.60]  these days
[2428.60 --> 2429.94]  about boundaries
[2429.94 --> 2430.86]  and such
[2430.86 --> 2432.28]  about needing
[2432.28 --> 2433.36]  to keep some distance
[2433.36 --> 2434.40]  from your patients
[2434.40 --> 2435.44]  not getting
[2435.44 --> 2436.70]  too emotionally involved
[2436.70 --> 2439.12]  She befriended him
[2439.12 --> 2441.48]  But having long
[2441.48 --> 2441.94]  forgotten
[2441.94 --> 2442.80]  how to act
[2442.80 --> 2443.50]  with a friend
[2443.50 --> 2445.94]  the old man
[2445.94 --> 2446.60]  just told her
[2446.60 --> 2447.54]  to beat it
[2447.54 --> 2449.02]  Go away
[2449.02 --> 2450.14]  Leave me alone
[2450.14 --> 2452.14]  But she would
[2452.14 --> 2452.66]  just smile
[2452.66 --> 2454.34]  She'd always try
[2454.34 --> 2454.74]  to get him
[2454.74 --> 2455.70]  to eat what he could
[2455.70 --> 2457.10]  and in the evening
[2457.10 --> 2458.54]  her irregular shifts
[2458.54 --> 2460.12]  she would tuck him in
[2460.12 --> 2461.08]  and he would growl
[2461.08 --> 2461.46]  at her
[2461.46 --> 2463.04]  I don't need anybody
[2463.04 --> 2463.72]  to help me
[2463.72 --> 2466.66]  Soon he grew so weak
[2466.66 --> 2467.26]  he did not have
[2467.26 --> 2467.86]  the strength
[2467.86 --> 2468.68]  to resist
[2468.68 --> 2469.68]  her kindness
[2469.68 --> 2471.42]  Late at night
[2471.42 --> 2473.26]  Who knows why
[2473.26 --> 2474.56]  when her duties
[2474.56 --> 2475.04]  were done
[2475.04 --> 2476.04]  she would pull up
[2476.04 --> 2476.44]  a chair
[2476.44 --> 2478.50]  sit by his bed
[2478.50 --> 2480.14]  and sing to him
[2480.14 --> 2481.52]  and read the Bible
[2481.52 --> 2482.24]  as she held
[2482.24 --> 2482.76]  his old
[2482.76 --> 2483.72]  weak hand
[2483.72 --> 2486.44]  Did he come
[2486.44 --> 2487.16]  to look at her
[2487.16 --> 2489.22]  and see the face
[2489.22 --> 2489.88]  of a little one
[2489.88 --> 2490.40]  he never
[2490.40 --> 2491.58]  got the chance
[2491.58 --> 2492.42]  to see grow up
[2492.42 --> 2494.20]  Who knows
[2494.20 --> 2495.84]  But one of those nights
[2495.84 --> 2497.70]  he started to cry
[2497.70 --> 2498.34]  as she kissed him
[2498.34 --> 2498.72]  goodnight
[2498.72 --> 2500.96]  and for the first time
[2500.96 --> 2502.22]  in many many years
[2502.22 --> 2503.80]  he whispered the words
[2503.80 --> 2505.94]  God bless you
[2505.94 --> 2508.92]  And as she left the room
[2508.92 --> 2510.98]  two others remained
[2510.98 --> 2512.00]  breathless
[2512.00 --> 2513.88]  whispering softly
[2513.88 --> 2515.08]  in the old man's ear
[2515.08 --> 2516.74]  the last word he heard
[2516.74 --> 2518.00]  before slipping away
[2518.00 --> 2519.20]  into the dark valley
[2519.20 --> 2520.58]  the word
[2520.58 --> 2521.38]  the goal
[2521.38 --> 2522.54]  of heaven's pursuit
[2522.54 --> 2523.18]  was
[2523.18 --> 2524.08]  gotcha
[2524.08 --> 2527.78]  whispered in unison
[2527.78 --> 2528.16]  by
[2528.16 --> 2529.10]  you guessed it
[2529.10 --> 2530.02]  goodness
[2530.02 --> 2531.50]  and love
[2531.50 --> 2532.56]  God's
[2532.56 --> 2533.26]  goodness
[2533.26 --> 2534.62]  and love
[2534.62 --> 2536.74]  But you know
[2536.74 --> 2537.76]  we could all tell
[2537.76 --> 2539.18]  all kinds of stories
[2539.18 --> 2539.74]  of our own
[2539.74 --> 2540.20]  couldn't we
[2540.20 --> 2541.82]  stories about
[2541.82 --> 2542.76]  a pursuing shepherd
[2542.76 --> 2543.50]  who does not know
[2543.50 --> 2543.94]  the meaning
[2543.94 --> 2544.56]  of the word
[2544.56 --> 2545.02]  quitter
[2545.02 --> 2546.38]  who was always
[2546.38 --> 2547.02]  out seeking
[2547.02 --> 2547.70]  chasing
[2547.70 --> 2548.82]  hunting us down
[2548.82 --> 2550.02]  All of us
[2550.02 --> 2551.34]  come on
[2551.34 --> 2552.56]  All of us
[2552.56 --> 2553.08]  have wandered
[2553.08 --> 2553.98]  crooked paths
[2553.98 --> 2555.48]  All of us
[2555.48 --> 2556.70]  have been in dry places
[2556.70 --> 2557.82]  All of us
[2557.82 --> 2558.42]  have been tossed
[2558.42 --> 2559.26]  back and forth
[2559.26 --> 2559.92]  like a branch
[2559.92 --> 2561.14]  in some raging torrent
[2561.14 --> 2562.28]  but somehow
[2562.28 --> 2563.60]  someway
[2563.60 --> 2564.52]  somewhere
[2564.52 --> 2567.08]  goodness and love
[2567.08 --> 2568.60]  have met us there
[2568.60 --> 2570.08]  and pursued us
[2570.08 --> 2570.58]  even
[2570.58 --> 2571.96]  into our valleys
[2571.96 --> 2573.80]  Thank God
[2573.80 --> 2575.10]  they did
[2575.10 --> 2577.68]  the stories
[2577.68 --> 2578.20]  we tell
[2578.20 --> 2579.16]  or we could tell
[2579.16 --> 2579.70]  rather about
[2579.70 --> 2580.64]  our own children
[2580.64 --> 2581.88]  but we won't
[2581.88 --> 2582.34]  right now
[2582.34 --> 2584.02]  You and I
[2584.02 --> 2584.44]  brought them
[2584.44 --> 2585.26]  many years ago
[2585.26 --> 2586.82]  to the front
[2586.82 --> 2587.34]  of the church
[2587.34 --> 2587.86]  and they were
[2587.86 --> 2588.24]  baptized
[2588.24 --> 2590.22]  We heard God's
[2590.22 --> 2590.88]  promise to be
[2590.88 --> 2591.40]  their God
[2591.40 --> 2593.10]  their shepherd
[2593.10 --> 2594.46]  to lead them
[2594.46 --> 2595.50]  to guide them
[2595.50 --> 2597.22]  for his name's sake
[2597.22 --> 2598.68]  He tied his name
[2598.68 --> 2599.28]  to theirs
[2599.28 --> 2600.90]  I baptize you
[2600.90 --> 2601.30]  in the name
[2601.30 --> 2601.90]  of the Father
[2601.90 --> 2602.66]  and of the Son
[2602.66 --> 2603.90]  and of the Holy Spirit
[2603.90 --> 2605.90]  As parents
[2605.90 --> 2606.80]  we made our vows
[2606.80 --> 2607.80]  and we did our best
[2607.80 --> 2608.48]  and sometimes
[2608.48 --> 2609.26]  our worst
[2609.26 --> 2611.10]  Everybody knows
[2611.10 --> 2611.88]  that being a parent
[2611.88 --> 2613.14]  is not always a picnic
[2613.14 --> 2614.68]  As one experienced
[2614.68 --> 2615.70]  parent once put it
[2615.70 --> 2616.60]  Before I was married
[2616.60 --> 2617.42]  and had a family
[2617.42 --> 2618.72]  I had five theories
[2618.72 --> 2619.80]  about raising children
[2619.80 --> 2621.48]  Now I have five children
[2621.48 --> 2622.60]  and no theories
[2622.60 --> 2625.64]  Well so our little sheep
[2625.64 --> 2626.68]  grew up
[2626.68 --> 2627.32]  and they found
[2627.32 --> 2628.04]  those paths
[2628.04 --> 2628.74]  that could hardly
[2628.74 --> 2629.74]  be described
[2629.74 --> 2630.42]  as righteous
[2630.42 --> 2631.42]  and they gave
[2631.42 --> 2632.42]  no rest to us
[2632.42 --> 2633.56]  if it ever did
[2633.56 --> 2634.44]  to them
[2634.44 --> 2637.04]  But then for many of us
[2637.04 --> 2637.52]  if not
[2637.52 --> 2638.96]  for all of us
[2638.96 --> 2639.60]  yet
[2639.60 --> 2641.58]  came the moment
[2641.58 --> 2642.28]  you sometimes
[2642.28 --> 2643.62]  did not dare hope for
[2643.62 --> 2645.62]  and will never forget
[2645.62 --> 2647.10]  your children
[2647.10 --> 2647.80]  once again
[2647.80 --> 2649.08]  at the front of the church
[2649.08 --> 2649.82]  this time
[2649.82 --> 2651.02]  on their own two feet
[2651.02 --> 2652.18]  saying yes
[2652.18 --> 2652.98]  to the promises
[2652.98 --> 2653.62]  of God
[2653.62 --> 2654.40]  made to them
[2654.40 --> 2655.48]  years before
[2655.48 --> 2656.96]  and in the background
[2656.96 --> 2658.58]  had you listened carefully
[2658.58 --> 2659.72]  you would have heard
[2659.72 --> 2660.62]  God's duet
[2660.62 --> 2661.64]  of goodness and love
[2661.64 --> 2662.48]  sing it out
[2662.48 --> 2663.24]  gotcha
[2663.24 --> 2666.74]  Surely
[2666.74 --> 2668.18]  goodness and love
[2668.18 --> 2669.96]  will pursue me
[2669.96 --> 2671.68]  all the days
[2671.68 --> 2672.56]  of my life
[2672.56 --> 2675.24]  This is God's promise
[2675.24 --> 2675.72]  to you
[2675.72 --> 2677.68]  and to every one
[2677.68 --> 2678.62]  of our children
[2678.62 --> 2680.16]  that we brought
[2680.16 --> 2680.90]  to the church
[2680.90 --> 2681.66]  to be baptized
[2681.66 --> 2684.02]  I will be their God
[2684.02 --> 2684.72]  their shepherd
[2684.72 --> 2686.60]  and I will pursue you
[2686.60 --> 2688.22]  and I will pursue them
[2688.22 --> 2688.92]  with you
[2688.92 --> 2689.92]  and without you
[2689.92 --> 2691.64]  In the waters of baptism
[2691.64 --> 2692.52]  the good shepherd
[2692.52 --> 2693.26]  declares that
[2693.26 --> 2694.76]  overriding your vows
[2694.76 --> 2696.32]  our parental vows
[2696.32 --> 2698.42]  and all our unfaithfulness
[2698.42 --> 2700.20]  is the covenant
[2700.20 --> 2701.08]  faithfulness
[2701.08 --> 2701.70]  of God
[2701.70 --> 2704.16]  because his name
[2704.16 --> 2705.00]  is now tied
[2705.00 --> 2705.58]  to theirs
[2705.58 --> 2706.52]  as a gift
[2706.52 --> 2707.24]  of his goodness
[2707.24 --> 2707.82]  and love
[2707.82 --> 2708.42]  in Jesus
[2708.42 --> 2709.62]  and because God
[2709.62 --> 2710.86]  cares about the honor
[2710.86 --> 2711.58]  of his name
[2711.58 --> 2713.62]  and is jealous
[2713.62 --> 2715.02]  for his own good reputation
[2715.02 --> 2717.44]  you may know
[2717.44 --> 2720.16]  that his pursuit
[2720.16 --> 2721.00]  of their heart
[2721.00 --> 2723.16]  and their life
[2723.16 --> 2724.92]  will be relentless
[2724.92 --> 2726.90]  and intentional
[2726.90 --> 2728.48]  and deliberate
[2728.48 --> 2730.88]  He will never give up
[2730.88 --> 2731.38]  making
[2731.38 --> 2732.32]  leading
[2732.32 --> 2733.16]  restoring
[2733.16 --> 2733.94]  comforting
[2733.94 --> 2734.80]  preparing
[2734.80 --> 2736.40]  and anointing them
[2736.40 --> 2737.46]  never give up
[2737.46 --> 2740.12]  to have them stand up
[2740.12 --> 2741.16]  and say
[2741.16 --> 2742.38]  the Lord
[2742.38 --> 2744.02]  is my shepherd
[2744.02 --> 2748.88]  Maybe there are some here
[2748.88 --> 2750.86]  who haven't yet found
[2750.86 --> 2751.80]  their rest
[2751.80 --> 2752.68]  in the Lord
[2752.68 --> 2754.56]  who is the good shepherd
[2754.56 --> 2755.26]  Maybe
[2755.26 --> 2756.64]  there are some here
[2756.64 --> 2757.32]  whose children
[2757.32 --> 2758.46]  invisibly marked
[2758.46 --> 2759.54]  with the sign and seal
[2759.54 --> 2760.90]  of the good shepherd
[2760.90 --> 2762.14]  from their childhood on
[2762.14 --> 2763.54]  are wandering away
[2763.54 --> 2764.78]  from the right paths
[2764.78 --> 2767.22]  wandering away
[2767.22 --> 2768.44]  from the green pastures
[2768.44 --> 2770.04]  the quiet waters
[2770.04 --> 2772.44]  I cannot guarantee
[2772.44 --> 2774.08]  they will one day
[2774.08 --> 2775.14]  find their way home
[2775.14 --> 2776.86]  as much as you
[2776.86 --> 2778.06]  and I may pray for that
[2778.06 --> 2780.10]  but I can guarantee
[2780.10 --> 2780.72]  you this
[2780.72 --> 2782.34]  rather
[2782.34 --> 2783.72]  the good shepherd
[2783.72 --> 2785.42]  assures you
[2785.42 --> 2786.54]  of this
[2786.54 --> 2787.82]  surely
[2787.82 --> 2789.36]  his goodness
[2789.36 --> 2790.20]  and love
[2790.20 --> 2792.44]  will pursue them
[2792.44 --> 2794.18]  all the days
[2794.18 --> 2795.10]  of their lives
[2795.10 --> 2796.96]  even if it takes
[2796.96 --> 2797.66]  as long
[2797.66 --> 2798.30]  as the day
[2798.30 --> 2798.92]  they enter
[2798.92 --> 2799.58]  the valley
[2799.58 --> 2800.42]  of the shadow
[2800.42 --> 2801.54]  of death
[2801.54 --> 2804.14]  you remember
[2804.14 --> 2804.62]  right
[2804.62 --> 2805.18]  the criminal
[2805.18 --> 2806.36]  on the cross
[2806.36 --> 2807.28]  beside Jesus
[2807.28 --> 2809.08]  Jesus
[2809.08 --> 2809.62]  he begged
[2809.62 --> 2810.38]  remember me
[2810.38 --> 2811.42]  when you come
[2811.42 --> 2812.10]  into your kingdom
[2812.10 --> 2814.98]  it was his deathbed prayer
[2814.98 --> 2817.16]  and the good shepherd
[2817.16 --> 2817.94]  whose determined
[2817.94 --> 2818.60]  pursuit
[2818.60 --> 2819.46]  would not even
[2819.46 --> 2820.04]  stop him
[2820.04 --> 2820.64]  from becoming
[2820.64 --> 2821.56]  the sacrificial
[2821.56 --> 2822.44]  lamb of God
[2822.44 --> 2823.64]  broken
[2823.64 --> 2824.18]  the man bleeding
[2824.18 --> 2824.82]  for the sin
[2824.82 --> 2825.40]  of the world
[2825.40 --> 2826.40]  answered him
[2826.40 --> 2827.20]  today
[2827.20 --> 2829.00]  you will be with me
[2829.00 --> 2830.28]  in paradise
[2830.28 --> 2832.36]  as all the goodness
[2832.36 --> 2833.30]  and love of heaven
[2833.30 --> 2834.80]  shouted in harmony
[2834.80 --> 2835.72]  gotcha
[2835.72 --> 2839.42]  so take this
[2839.42 --> 2840.08]  old friend
[2840.08 --> 2842.08]  Psalm 23
[2842.08 --> 2843.70]  home with you today
[2843.70 --> 2846.32]  treasure it
[2846.32 --> 2847.74]  cherish it
[2847.74 --> 2849.20]  keep singing it
[2849.20 --> 2850.20]  with confidence
[2850.20 --> 2851.52]  until the last sheep
[2851.52 --> 2853.02]  and God's weary flock
[2853.02 --> 2854.32]  have found their
[2854.32 --> 2855.32]  final rest
[2855.32 --> 2857.06]  until the climax
[2857.06 --> 2858.48]  of the shepherd's
[2858.48 --> 2859.16]  psalm is reached
[2859.16 --> 2859.82]  for all
[2859.82 --> 2861.22]  of God's lost sheep
[2861.22 --> 2862.12]  and in the words
[2862.12 --> 2863.88]  of the final variation
[2863.88 --> 2865.10]  of this old song
[2865.10 --> 2866.12]  in the Bible
[2866.12 --> 2867.36]  Revelation 7
[2867.36 --> 2869.90]  all those who have been
[2869.90 --> 2870.98]  washed in the blood
[2870.98 --> 2871.96]  of the shepherd lamb
[2871.96 --> 2872.84]  and now I quote
[2872.84 --> 2874.54]  are before the throne
[2874.54 --> 2875.22]  of God
[2875.22 --> 2876.40]  and serve him
[2876.40 --> 2877.20]  day and night
[2877.20 --> 2878.06]  in his temple
[2878.06 --> 2879.52]  and he
[2879.52 --> 2880.44]  who sits
[2880.44 --> 2881.20]  on the throne
[2881.20 --> 2882.26]  will spread
[2882.26 --> 2882.76]  his tent
[2882.76 --> 2883.54]  over us
[2883.54 --> 2885.00]  never again
[2885.00 --> 2885.70]  will be hunger
[2885.70 --> 2887.16]  never again
[2887.16 --> 2888.28]  will be thirst
[2888.28 --> 2889.56]  the sun
[2889.56 --> 2890.16]  will not beat
[2890.16 --> 2890.70]  upon us
[2890.70 --> 2891.12]  nor any
[2891.12 --> 2891.96]  scorching heat
[2891.96 --> 2893.14]  for the lamb
[2893.14 --> 2893.82]  at the center
[2893.82 --> 2894.58]  of the throne
[2894.58 --> 2895.82]  will be our shepherd
[2895.82 --> 2896.94]  he will lead us
[2896.94 --> 2897.56]  to springs
[2897.56 --> 2898.58]  of living water
[2898.58 --> 2899.70]  and God
[2899.70 --> 2900.66]  will wipe
[2900.66 --> 2901.78]  every tear
[2901.78 --> 2903.36]  from our eyes
[2903.36 --> 2905.46]  until then
[2905.46 --> 2906.54]  you can count
[2906.54 --> 2907.22]  on it
[2907.22 --> 2908.20]  surely
[2908.20 --> 2909.30]  goodness
[2909.30 --> 2909.80]  and love
[2909.80 --> 2911.24]  will pursue me
[2911.24 --> 2912.58]  you
[2912.58 --> 2914.44]  all the days
[2914.44 --> 2915.78]  of your life
[2915.78 --> 2918.94]  you might not
[2918.94 --> 2919.52]  always like
[2919.52 --> 2920.10]  or appreciate
[2920.10 --> 2921.10]  or enjoy them
[2921.10 --> 2922.20]  now
[2922.20 --> 2922.98]  goodness
[2922.98 --> 2923.50]  and love
[2923.50 --> 2924.20]  can be
[2924.20 --> 2925.80]  a royal pain
[2925.80 --> 2926.24]  in the neck
[2926.24 --> 2928.08]  but one day
[2928.08 --> 2929.24]  you will praise
[2929.24 --> 2929.88]  God for them
[2929.88 --> 2930.74]  forever
[2930.74 --> 2932.04]  in the name
[2932.04 --> 2932.58]  of the Father
[2932.58 --> 2933.10]  and the Son
[2933.10 --> 2934.52]  and the Holy Spirit
[2934.52 --> 2935.94]  let's pray
[2935.94 --> 2938.78]  gracious God
[2938.78 --> 2939.48]  we thank you
[2939.48 --> 2941.60]  for this old friend
[2941.60 --> 2944.06]  and for the reminder
[2944.06 --> 2945.12]  of a love
[2945.12 --> 2946.28]  that is unlike
[2946.28 --> 2947.46]  any other love
[2947.46 --> 2948.78]  we have ever known
[2948.78 --> 2952.30]  a love that pursued us
[2952.30 --> 2954.00]  that pursued the whole world
[2954.00 --> 2955.62]  unto death
[2955.62 --> 2956.60]  even the death
[2956.60 --> 2957.20]  of Jesus
[2957.20 --> 2958.22]  our Savior
[2958.22 --> 2960.88]  a love Lord
[2960.88 --> 2961.58]  that guaranteed
[2961.58 --> 2962.32]  for us
[2962.32 --> 2963.40]  the promise
[2963.40 --> 2964.02]  of life
[2964.02 --> 2964.88]  new life
[2964.88 --> 2965.78]  eternal life
[2965.78 --> 2967.66]  in our resurrected Lord
[2967.66 --> 2970.16]  and so Lord
[2970.16 --> 2971.00]  help us to entrust
[2971.00 --> 2971.44]  ourselves
[2971.44 --> 2972.34]  entrust our children
[2972.34 --> 2973.42]  entrust our grandchildren
[2973.42 --> 2973.44]  entrust our grandchildren
[2973.44 --> 2974.68]  entrust Lord
[2974.68 --> 2975.64]  those whom we know
[2975.64 --> 2977.58]  who are not
[2977.58 --> 2979.52]  walking in your ways
[2979.52 --> 2981.68]  who are straying
[2981.68 --> 2982.46]  from your ways
[2982.46 --> 2983.60]  to entrust them all
[2983.60 --> 2983.98]  to you
[2983.98 --> 2985.44]  in the confidence
[2985.44 --> 2986.28]  that you will
[2986.28 --> 2987.10]  hold them fast
[2987.10 --> 2989.12]  in the sure
[2989.12 --> 2990.30]  hope and confidence
[2990.30 --> 2991.64]  that your love
[2991.64 --> 2993.06]  never fails
[2993.06 --> 2994.92]  it never gives up
[2994.92 --> 2996.36]  on me
[2996.36 --> 2998.86]  in Jesus name
[2998.86 --> 2999.30]  we pray
[2999.30 --> 3000.18]  amen
[3000.18 --> 3011.56]  would you please rise

[3019.38 --> 3030.30]  when I fear my faith
[3030.30 --> 3031.82]  will fail

[3035.76 --> 3038.22]  when the tender world
[3038.22 --> 3039.82]  prevails

[3043.68 --> 3048.02]  I will never keep my hope
[3048.02 --> 3051.96]  through life's fearful path
[3051.96 --> 3056.30]  for my love is often cold

[3223.86 --> 3227.86]  you may be seated
[3227.86 --> 3228.86]  our offering this morning
[3228.86 --> 3231.86]  is for Cascade Christian Counseling
[3231.86 --> 3234.86]  and you can read more about that
[3234.86 --> 3236.86]  on the screen, I think
[3236.86 --> 3241.86]  do we have something for the offering on the screen?
[3241.86 --> 3243.86]  yeah, okay, thank you
[3266.86 --> 3268.86]  your great speaking

[3334.78 --> 3336.78]  Amen.
[3364.78 --> 3378.90]  If you have read your bulletin or the communication that came out today, you will know that a member of this congregation for many years, Joe Luftwaffe, passed away on Wednesday quite suddenly.
[3380.12 --> 3384.08]  And so we want to remember his family in our prayers as well this morning.
[3384.08 --> 3396.62]  After we have prayed together, we will end with a shortened version of the song we've been learning that is the Lord's Prayer.
[3397.64 --> 3398.66]  Let's pray together.
[3401.96 --> 3410.58]  Lord of heaven and earth, we come to you in worship because you are the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
[3410.58 --> 3413.90]  Life without you makes no sense.
[3414.90 --> 3417.12]  You have made us and you redeem us.
[3418.50 --> 3426.26]  Lord, we thank you for the word that we heard this morning and what a comfort that is that you pursue us, your love and your mercy.
[3427.36 --> 3430.26]  Thank you for that deep, deep grace in our lives.
[3431.72 --> 3437.18]  May our adoration this morning bring you delight and may we be changed because we met you here.
[3437.18 --> 3443.90]  Thank you for your love that chases us down even when we are struggling with sorrow and losses.
[3444.62 --> 3449.28]  Give us faith to see that you are always the one who walks beside us.
[3450.28 --> 3461.62]  Today we remember especially Nancy, Laura, Lisa, Ken, Henny and other family members as they grieve the loss of husband, father, brother and grandfather Joe.
[3461.62 --> 3472.58]  His sudden passing from this earth is a deep sorrow and so we ask that Joe's family and friends experience your faithful presence in the days to come.
[3473.68 --> 3481.50]  Extend an extra measure of comfort to Nancy and Henny as they try to process the same day loss of their sister-in-law in Grand Rapids.
[3482.26 --> 3483.44]  Grant them your mercy.
[3483.44 --> 3489.58]  We continue to bring before you Kakuya as he heals from accident injuries.
[3490.32 --> 3492.18]  Thank you for his progress so far.
[3493.12 --> 3497.58]  We ask you too for your care over Pat who struggles with ongoing kidney disease.
[3498.42 --> 3501.92]  We ask your intervention in this so that she may be healed.
[3503.02 --> 3506.04]  There are others who are confined to their homes and lonely.
[3506.98 --> 3509.00]  May we encourage them as we are able.
[3509.00 --> 3517.38]  We thank you for walking with George and Carrie in this precarious time of uncertainty in George's health journey once again.
[3518.56 --> 3520.52]  Uphold them and their families, we pray.
[3521.50 --> 3528.12]  We pray for his medical team and know that your healing hand is able to do more than we ask or imagine.
[3529.08 --> 3529.96]  You are good.
[3529.96 --> 3530.92]  We pray for one another.
[3530.92 --> 3531.50]  We pray for your work.
[3531.50 --> 3531.56]  We pray for your life.
[3531.56 --> 3531.84]  We pray for your life.
[3531.84 --> 3532.64]  We pray for your company and know that your друзья may be healed.
[3532.64 --> 3532.98]  We pray for your love.
[3533.10 --> 3540.22]  We pray for the wonders of your creation that we so enjoy during the warmer months as we explore different areas near or far.
[3540.90 --> 3546.08]  We are in awe of the beauty that surrounds us in so many places.
[3546.80 --> 3550.40]  On this long weekend, keep safe those who travel.
[3551.24 --> 3559.10]  Give strength and endurance to first responders and firefighters throughout all the devastation of the forest fires.
[3559.86 --> 3563.56]  We are so thankful for these men and women who risk their lives for others.
[3564.20 --> 3567.62]  We pray for those who have lost property and livelihoods.
[3567.84 --> 3572.46]  We ask that they will receive help in time of need and that you will lead us too
[3572.46 --> 3575.38]  to be your hands and feet wherever you call us.
[3576.58 --> 3579.86]  Lord, we thank you for these months of relaxation for students.
[3580.72 --> 3584.10]  Bless those who lead Christian kids' camps over the summer.
[3584.96 --> 3589.04]  May many come to know you or spread their roots of faith even deeper.
[3590.10 --> 3593.72]  We know that the hurt in this world is so prevalent.
[3594.74 --> 3598.24]  We pray for your spirit to move mightily over this groaning earth.
[3599.28 --> 3602.72]  May the spirit's fruit become a bumper crop among your people
[3602.72 --> 3609.48]  and spread throughout all nations so that your love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[3609.80 --> 3614.56]  gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control would overcome the powers of darkness.
[3615.34 --> 3617.54]  We long for this to be so.
[3617.54 --> 3624.06]  As your church in all places goes out into this week, fill her to overflowing.
[3625.06 --> 3630.24]  Give us an imagination for what could be when we follow you in full obedience and love.
[3630.98 --> 3635.60]  All the praise and glory to you forever in Christ our Lord.
[3636.36 --> 3636.68]  Amen.
[3636.68 --> 3636.84]  Amen.
[3636.84 --> 3650.90]  Father, let your kingdom come.

[3707.34 --> 3709.22]  It's yours.
[3709.22 --> 3711.06]  All yours.
[3711.06 --> 3712.76]  All yours.

[3720.18 --> 3721.60]  It's yours.
[3721.60 --> 3723.50]  It's yours.

[3733.96 --> 3736.78]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[3737.52 --> 3740.54]  Father, let your will be done.
[3740.54 --> 3747.54]  On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.

[3755.38 --> 3755.78]  Amen.
[3760.78 --> 3764.56]  Now lift up your hearts and receive God's parting blessing this morning.
[3764.96 --> 3773.26]  May the great shepherd gather you in his arms, carry you close to his heart, and watch over you always.
[3773.26 --> 3786.10]  May his rod and staff defend you, guide you in paths of righteousness, protect you in all the valleys of life, and lead you in the way everlasting now and forever.
[3786.10 --> 3788.78]  And all God's people say, amen.

[3809.32 --> 3821.36]  Jesus, no wonder yet lives, you have taken all our shame.
[3821.36 --> 3832.80]  Spirit, who still wants hearts to say, they'll never be the same.
[3832.80 --> 3845.88]  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the one, to God.
[3845.88 --> 3856.76]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[3856.76 --> 3866.84]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
