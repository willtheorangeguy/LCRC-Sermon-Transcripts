[497.98 --> 499.98]  Thank you.
[499.98 --> 501.98]  Thank you.
[501.98 --> 503.98]  Thank you.
[503.98 --> 505.98]  Thank you.
[505.98 --> 507.98]  Thank you.
[507.98 --> 509.98]  Thank you.
[509.98 --> 511.98]  Thank you.
[511.98 --> 513.98]  Thank you.
[513.98 --> 515.98]  Thank you.
[515.98 --> 517.98]  Thank you.

[577.98 --> 579.98]  Thank you.
[579.98 --> 581.98]  Thank you.
[581.98 --> 583.98]  Thank you for that.
[583.98 --> 585.98]  Thank you.
[585.98 --> 587.98]  Thank you.
[587.98 --> 589.98]  Thank you.
[589.98 --> 591.98]  Thank you.
[591.98 --> 610.30]  Gather us in the rich and the haught. Gather us in the proud and the strong. Give us the heart so weak and so lowly. Give us the courage to enter the song.
[610.30 --> 611.30]  Amen.
[640.30 --> 642.30]  Amen.
[670.30 --> 671.30]  Amen.
[700.30 --> 703.30]  Amen.
[730.30 --> 740.16]  The flower of earthly splendor
[740.16 --> 744.34]  In time I should lay dry
[744.34 --> 748.62]  In its fragile blue surrender
[748.62 --> 753.38]  To you the Lord goes high
[753.38 --> 757.80]  But we live from all nature
[757.80 --> 762.12]  The eternal single soul
[762.12 --> 766.20]  The solid and structure
[766.20 --> 770.62]  To heaven's garden flow
[770.62 --> 775.20]  For our lives to our lives of heaven
[775.20 --> 779.72]  From death they set us free
[779.72 --> 784.00]  And we who live our kingdom
[784.00 --> 788.32]  The final victory
[788.32 --> 798.24]  And hear, oh gracious Savior
[798.24 --> 802.32]  And set the love we free
[802.32 --> 807.20]  That we look on your favor
[807.20 --> 811.52]  They serve you as our King
[811.52 --> 815.84]  And whether our tomorrows
[815.84 --> 819.84]  Be filled with good or ill
[819.84 --> 823.84]  Lift up to our sorrows
[823.84 --> 827.84]  And rise to bless you still
[827.84 --> 832.16]  To our Lord
[832.16 --> 837.76]  And glory in your ways
[837.76 --> 842.16]  And may our gentle duty
[842.16 --> 846.24]  Are a sacrifice of praise
[846.24 --> 861.20]  You may be seated
[861.20 --> 866.30]  Indeed, it's our sacrifice of praise
[866.30 --> 867.98]  And this is a joyous duty
[867.98 --> 868.78]  This morning
[868.78 --> 871.18]  I'm going to be reading
[871.18 --> 872.24]  Habakkuk's prayer
[872.24 --> 875.42]  From the book of Habakkuk
[875.42 --> 876.34]  Chapter 3
[876.34 --> 879.88]  Pastor Lauder asked me to read this
[879.88 --> 881.16]  As he will refer to this
[881.16 --> 882.02]  In his sermon
[882.02 --> 885.52]  Habakkuk 3
[885.52 --> 887.54]  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet
[887.54 --> 891.38]  Lord, I have heard of your fame
[891.38 --> 893.90]  I stand in awe of your deeds, Lord
[893.90 --> 895.88]  Repeat them in our day
[895.88 --> 898.74]  In our time, make them known
[898.74 --> 901.24]  In wrath, remember mercy
[901.24 --> 903.78]  God came from Teman
[903.78 --> 905.70]  The Holy One from Mount Paran
[905.70 --> 908.18]  His glory covered the heavens
[908.18 --> 910.76]  And his praise filled the earth
[910.76 --> 913.48]  His splendor was like the sunrise
[913.48 --> 915.92]  Rays flashed from his hand
[915.92 --> 917.58]  Where his power was hidden
[917.58 --> 920.14]  Plague went before him
[920.14 --> 922.56]  Pestilence followed his steps
[922.56 --> 924.90]  He stood and shook the earth
[924.90 --> 928.28]  He looked and made the nations tremble
[928.28 --> 930.72]  The ancient mountains crumbled
[930.72 --> 933.46]  And the age-old hills collapsed
[933.46 --> 935.74]  But he marches on forever
[935.74 --> 938.96]  I saw the tents of Kushan in distress
[938.96 --> 941.92]  The dwellings of Midian in anguish
[941.92 --> 945.22]  Were you angry with the rivers, Lord?
[945.22 --> 947.74]  Was your wrath against the streams?
[948.44 --> 950.18]  Did you rage against the sea
[950.18 --> 951.38]  When you rode your horses
[951.38 --> 952.90]  And your chariots to victory?
[954.08 --> 955.52]  You uncovered your bow
[955.52 --> 957.74]  You called for many arrows
[957.74 --> 960.48]  You split the earth with rivers
[960.48 --> 963.22]  The mountains saw you and writhed
[963.22 --> 965.26]  Torrents of water swept by
[965.26 --> 968.52]  The deep roared and lifted its waves on high
[968.52 --> 973.28]  Sun and moon stood still in the heavens
[973.28 --> 975.84]  At the glint of your flying arrows
[975.84 --> 978.74]  At the lightning of your flashing spear
[978.74 --> 981.80]  In wrath you strode through the earth
[981.80 --> 984.46]  And in anger you threshed the nations
[984.46 --> 987.42]  You came out to deliver your people
[987.42 --> 988.98]  To save your anointed one
[988.98 --> 992.30]  You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness
[992.30 --> 995.16]  You stripped him from head to foot
[995.16 --> 998.62]  With his own spear you pierced his head
[998.62 --> 1001.50]  When his warriors stormed out to scatter us
[1001.50 --> 1003.46]  Gloating us, though, about to devour
[1003.46 --> 1005.20]  The wretched who were in hiding
[1005.20 --> 1008.46]  You trampled the sea with your horses
[1008.46 --> 1010.64]  Churning the great waters
[1010.64 --> 1014.60]  I heard and my heart pounded
[1014.60 --> 1016.74]  My lips quivered at the sound
[1016.74 --> 1019.54]  Decay crept into my bones
[1019.54 --> 1021.96]  And my legs trembled
[1021.96 --> 1026.24]  Yet I will wait patiently
[1026.24 --> 1027.70]  For the day of calamity
[1027.70 --> 1030.32]  To come on the nation invading us
[1030.32 --> 1034.08]  Though the fig tree does not bud
[1034.08 --> 1037.14]  And there are no grapes on the vines
[1037.14 --> 1039.94]  Though the olive crop fails
[1039.94 --> 1042.98]  And the fields produce no food
[1042.98 --> 1045.80]  Though there are no sheep in the pen
[1045.80 --> 1048.32]  And no cattle in the stalls
[1048.32 --> 1052.10]  Yet I will rejoice in the Lord
[1052.10 --> 1055.58]  I will be joyful in God my Savior
[1055.58 --> 1058.38]  The sovereign Lord is my strength
[1058.38 --> 1061.82]  He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
[1061.82 --> 1065.46]  He enables me to tread on the heights
[1065.46 --> 1069.24]  This is the word of the Lord
[1069.24 --> 1072.40]  Let's sing
[1072.40 --> 1092.26]  Let's sing
[1092.26 --> 1094.26]  Blessed be your name
[1094.26 --> 1097.84]  In the land that is plentiful
[1097.84 --> 1102.04]  Where streams of abundance flow
[1102.04 --> 1105.36]  Blessed be your name
[1105.36 --> 1109.98]  Blessed be your name
[1109.98 --> 1113.90]  When I'm found in the desert place
[1113.90 --> 1117.40]  When I walk through the wilderness
[1117.40 --> 1118.78]  Blessed be your name
[1118.78 --> 1120.78]  Blessed be your name
[1120.78 --> 1122.66]  Blessed be your name
[1122.66 --> 1126.62]  Every blessing you pour out of
[1126.62 --> 1130.42]  Turn back to grace
[1130.42 --> 1134.28]  When the darkness closes in your
[1134.28 --> 1136.66]  Still I will stay
[1136.66 --> 1140.84]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1140.84 --> 1148.14]  Blessed be your name
[1148.14 --> 1150.26]  Blessed be your name
[1150.26 --> 1152.64]  Blessed be your name
[1152.64 --> 1157.06]  Blessed be your name
[1157.06 --> 1159.66]  Blessed be your name
[1159.66 --> 1164.02]  When the sun is shining down on me
[1164.02 --> 1167.66]  When the world is all as it should be
[1168.28 --> 1171.66]  Blessed be your name
[1171.66 --> 1175.66]  Blessed be your name
[1176.42 --> 1179.66]  On the road marked with suffering
[1180.22 --> 1183.66]  Though there's pain in the offering
[1183.66 --> 1187.66]  Blessed be your name
[1187.66 --> 1195.66]  If you bless me you pour out I'll turn back to praise
[1197.14 --> 1200.90]  When the darkness closes in light
[1200.90 --> 1203.66]  Still I will say
[1203.66 --> 1206.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1207.30 --> 1209.66]  Blessed be your name
[1209.66 --> 1214.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1214.66 --> 1219.66]  Blessed be your glory as he
[1219.66 --> 1229.66]  We'll sing for how long I'll turn back to praise
[1229.66 --> 1234.66]  When the darkness closes in light
[1234.66 --> 1237.66]  Still I will sing
[1237.66 --> 1240.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1240.66 --> 1244.66]  Blessed be your name
[1244.66 --> 1248.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1248.66 --> 1254.66]  Blessed be your glorious name
[1254.66 --> 1257.66]  Blessed be o'er
[1257.66 --> 1259.66]  For what can he say
[1259.66 --> 1264.66]  Easy
[1265.66 --> 1267.66]  We will sing
[1267.66 --> 1272.66]  Our confession this morning is taken from Psalm 51
[1272.66 --> 1279.54]  and I would just ask you to respond where you see the double arrows have
[1279.54 --> 1285.82]  mercy on me Oh God according to your steadfast love according to your
[1285.82 --> 1292.82]  abundant mercy blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my
[1292.82 --> 1300.70]  iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I know my transgressions and my sin is
[1300.70 --> 1309.88]  ever before me against you you alone have I sinned and done what is evil in your
[1309.88 --> 1316.78]  sight so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass
[1316.78 --> 1325.18]  judgment you desire truth in the inward being therefore teach me wisdom in my
[1325.18 --> 1335.02]  secret heart hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities create in
[1335.02 --> 1342.70]  me a clean heart Oh God and put a new and right spirit within me do not cast me
[1342.70 --> 1351.18]  from your presence and do not take your Holy Spirit from me and our words of our
[1351.18 --> 1359.46]  assurance of pardon from Psalm 103 the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to
[1359.46 --> 1367.32]  anger and abounding in steadfast love he will not always accuse nor will he keep
[1367.32 --> 1376.02]  his anger forever he does not deal with us according to our sins nor repay us
[1376.02 --> 1383.34]  according to our iniquities for as the heavens are high above the earth so great is his steadfast
[1383.34 --> 1391.74]  love toward those who fear him as far as the east is from the west so far he removes our transgressions
[1391.74 --> 1401.82]  from us as a father as a father has a oh I'm sorry this should be together as a father has compassion for his
[1401.82 --> 1410.74]  children so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him we're going to sing there's a wideness in God's mercy
[1410.74 --> 1420.44]  mercy
[1440.74 --> 1442.74]  Amen.
[1470.74 --> 1485.80]  There is no place where her sorrows are more found than a king now.
[1485.80 --> 1495.14]  There is no place where her spirits have such kindly judgment gave.
[1500.74 --> 1510.94]  For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind.
[1510.94 --> 1519.90]  And the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind.
[1520.30 --> 1523.64]  Break our love, O God we're faithful.
[1523.64 --> 1537.74]  Let us take you and your word, and our lives will be thanksgiving for the goodness of the Lord.
[1537.74 --> 1561.74]  And our children, ages three through grade three, are going to meet together in the room behind the kitchen for their Kids Life Sunday School.
[1561.74 --> 1565.40]  And we bless them as they go, and their teachers too.
[1567.74 --> 1574.84]  As Pastor Lauder is coming to the pulpit, a word of introduction.
[1576.38 --> 1579.44]  Theo Lauder resides with his wife and children in Cloverdale.
[1579.44 --> 1585.10]  He is an ordained pastor in Canada West Presbytery of the PCA.
[1585.50 --> 1592.98]  And has served as pastor in Reformed and Presbyterian churches in Alberta and British Columbia since 1997.
[1592.98 --> 1606.14]  He preaches at churches across Canada and is presently executive director of Life Renewal, which offers a recovery discipleship curriculum to churches across the country.
[1606.14 --> 1607.38]  Welcome.
[1607.38 --> 1617.62]  Thank you very much.
[1617.62 --> 1620.40]  It's very good to be with you this morning.
[1620.64 --> 1629.04]  It's been a while, and it's very good to have this opportunity to worship with you again and to bring God's word to you.
[1629.04 --> 1634.94]  I was wondering this morning, what should I wear?
[1635.24 --> 1637.86]  I don't know how the people in Ladner C.R.C. dress.
[1638.00 --> 1642.98]  I haven't been here for a while, so I put on my jacket, you know, my formal jacket.
[1643.46 --> 1648.12]  But I noticed lots of short sleeves and shorts, so I took the jacket off.
[1648.12 --> 1662.00]  Well, this morning we'll be focusing on God's Word in Acts 5, a difficult chapter.
[1662.64 --> 1668.40]  Acts 5, verses 1 through 11, and I will read that with you first, and I will be focusing
[1668.40 --> 1672.52]  on the following verses, the verses 12 through 16.
[1672.52 --> 1680.12]  But in order to understand that and to make sense of what we read there, we need to read
[1680.12 --> 1682.70]  the preceding 11 verses.
[1684.00 --> 1685.32]  Hear God's Word.
[1686.60 --> 1692.70]  Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.
[1693.56 --> 1698.12]  With his wife's full knowledge, he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought
[1698.12 --> 1700.56]  the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.
[1700.56 --> 1708.84]  Then Peter said, Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied
[1708.84 --> 1715.06]  to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?
[1716.02 --> 1718.54]  Didn't it belong to you before it was sold?
[1719.40 --> 1722.62]  And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal?
[1723.64 --> 1725.90]  What made you think of doing such a thing?
[1725.90 --> 1731.24]  You have not lied just to human beings, but to God.
[1732.52 --> 1736.66]  When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died.
[1738.06 --> 1741.74]  And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.
[1743.04 --> 1747.66]  Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
[1748.70 --> 1752.20]  But three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
[1752.20 --> 1758.26]  Peter asked her, Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?
[1759.70 --> 1761.66]  Yes, she said, that is the price.
[1762.80 --> 1766.88]  Peter said to her, How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord?
[1767.82 --> 1772.68]  Listen, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry
[1772.68 --> 1773.66]  you out also.
[1773.66 --> 1778.12]  At that moment, she fell down at his feet and died.
[1779.06 --> 1784.64]  Then the young men came in, and finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside
[1784.64 --> 1785.22]  her husband.
[1786.54 --> 1792.18]  Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
[1793.54 --> 1798.60]  And then we continue reading the text that we'll be giving our attention to this morning,
[1798.72 --> 1801.18]  which is the verses 12 through 16.
[1801.18 --> 1802.98]  I don't know if that's going to appear on the screen.
[1804.12 --> 1805.16]  I think it's coming.
[1811.00 --> 1811.68]  Maybe not.
[1813.92 --> 1815.30]  So I will read it to you.
[1816.06 --> 1817.54]  The verses 12 through 16.
[1819.16 --> 1820.66]  This is what happens after that.
[1820.78 --> 1821.90]  Oh, there we have it.
[1821.90 --> 1828.50]  The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people, and all the believers used
[1828.50 --> 1831.08]  to meet together in Solomon's colonnade.
[1832.02 --> 1836.34]  No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.
[1837.28 --> 1842.52]  Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.
[1842.52 --> 1854.58]  As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
[1855.42 --> 1865.12]  Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
[1865.12 --> 1869.20]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1871.30 --> 1872.22]  Let us pray.
[1873.46 --> 1881.88]  Lord our God, we thank you for your word, which is the life-giving word, and in it are many things that are difficult for us to understand.
[1881.88 --> 1886.76]  And maybe, if we're honest, we would say we would rather not hear them.
[1887.10 --> 1894.90]  But, Lord, your word is good and true and pure, and we need to hear it.
[1895.98 --> 1905.08]  We need your spirit to lead us into the truth, and we trust, Lord, and we pray that this morning you will do that by your mighty spirit.
[1905.78 --> 1907.20]  Look upon us in your grace.
[1907.20 --> 1913.92]  Help us to hear the voice of Jesus, our shepherd, and help us to follow.
[1915.16 --> 1916.74]  In his name we pray. Amen.
[1922.18 --> 1926.60]  When God comes in judgment, it's a fearful thing.
[1929.70 --> 1935.70]  Habakkuk paints a terrifying picture of such judgment as we read in Habakkuk 3.
[1937.20 --> 1940.68]  Plague goes out before the Lord.
[1941.18 --> 1942.94]  Mountains crumble before him.
[1943.32 --> 1944.38]  Hills collapse.
[1945.66 --> 1952.74]  Sun and moon stand still in the heavens as God strides through the earth.
[1953.88 --> 1958.82]  He tramples the sea and churns the great waters.
[1958.82 --> 1968.36]  We read in Acts 5 about the judgment that God brought upon Ananias and Sapphira for the sin of lying and stealing,
[1968.68 --> 1973.24]  and it resonates with what Habakkuk prays.
[1973.24 --> 1981.52]  Ananias and Sapphira sell land, and they pretend to give all the proceeds to the church.
[1984.32 --> 1986.80]  We made all this money, and it's all for the church.
[1986.80 --> 1991.72]  But in fact, they keep some of the money for themselves.
[1993.14 --> 1997.64]  They misappropriate for themselves what they had solemnly pledged to God.
[2000.92 --> 2005.98]  And God strikes them down at the apostles' feet, dead on the spot.
[2005.98 --> 2011.86]  Imagine being there when that happened.
[2015.16 --> 2018.78]  You can only imagine the shock that must have come over the early believers
[2018.78 --> 2023.46]  when they witnessed this.
[2023.70 --> 2025.10]  What could this mean?
[2027.34 --> 2029.86]  And who would be the next person to fall down?
[2029.86 --> 2035.98]  Ananias and Sapphira, pretty good people.
[2037.90 --> 2039.84]  Giving so much money to the church.
[2041.88 --> 2044.76]  We can imagine them praying something like Habakkuk prayed,
[2045.22 --> 2047.30]  Lord, we have heard of your fame.
[2047.82 --> 2050.22]  We stand in awe of your deeds, O Lord.
[2050.86 --> 2052.56]  Renew them in our day.
[2053.06 --> 2054.74]  In our time, make them known.
[2055.52 --> 2058.70]  In wrath, remember mercy.
[2059.86 --> 2063.32]  Now, whatever they may have prayed,
[2064.26 --> 2068.10]  it's clear from what happens next that that's exactly what God does.
[2069.46 --> 2073.16]  In wrath, he remembers mercy.
[2074.62 --> 2078.32]  He never turns away from the cry of the needy sinner.
[2079.48 --> 2082.16]  However sternly God deals with us,
[2082.82 --> 2086.38]  and however sternly he deals with wickedness and sin,
[2087.14 --> 2089.22]  as he did with Ananias and Sapphira,
[2089.86 --> 2092.88]  he's still a merciful and gracious God.
[2094.36 --> 2097.94]  He's always ready in his infinite mercy to help,
[2098.28 --> 2098.94]  to heal,
[2099.46 --> 2101.04]  to save
[2101.04 --> 2103.92]  all those who seek his face.
[2103.92 --> 2106.70]  And this is clear, first of all,
[2106.72 --> 2108.16]  in the miracles of the apostles.
[2109.86 --> 2114.02]  Luke tells us that right on the heels of this terrible judgment of God,
[2114.14 --> 2116.42]  God shows his power through miracles.
[2117.74 --> 2119.34]  Great fear
[2119.34 --> 2121.64]  gives way,
[2121.76 --> 2122.70]  makes way for
[2122.70 --> 2125.16]  great flourishing.
[2125.16 --> 2129.74]  like we just read,
[2129.74 --> 2133.46]  the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people.
[2134.38 --> 2135.78]  Right after this incident,
[2136.78 --> 2139.62]  right after this terrifying judgment of God.
[2139.62 --> 2144.82]  remember the disciples had prayed to God for two specific things.
[2145.70 --> 2148.24]  After Peter and John had been incarcerated,
[2148.24 --> 2152.60]  that happened just in chapter 4.
[2154.04 --> 2155.70]  Peter and John had been put in prison
[2155.70 --> 2159.24]  and threatened by the temple establishment.
[2162.08 --> 2166.16]  We read about that in verses 29 and 30 of chapter 4.
[2166.62 --> 2171.52]  And then they prayed that God would help to speak his word with great boldness.
[2171.52 --> 2174.30]  That's what they prayed they would be able to do.
[2177.80 --> 2178.98]  That was the first thing.
[2179.66 --> 2181.32]  But remember what else they prayed.
[2182.64 --> 2183.22]  They prayed,
[2183.62 --> 2185.42]  Stretch out your hand, O Lord,
[2185.52 --> 2189.24]  to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders
[2189.24 --> 2191.76]  through the name of your holy servant, Jesus.
[2196.58 --> 2198.40]  They were pleading on God's promises
[2198.40 --> 2200.60]  because that's exactly what Jesus had told them
[2200.60 --> 2201.82]  to do.
[2204.20 --> 2205.54]  And God had already answered.
[2205.64 --> 2206.98]  The first prayer we're told in
[2206.98 --> 2209.04]  in chapter 4, verse 32,
[2209.20 --> 2210.56]  that after they prayed,
[2210.68 --> 2212.36]  they were filled with the Holy Spirit
[2212.36 --> 2214.62]  and spoke the word of God boldly.
[2215.88 --> 2216.96]  And Peter, too,
[2217.02 --> 2218.94]  had spoken the word of God boldly
[2218.94 --> 2220.76]  in the face of flagrant sin
[2220.76 --> 2221.84]  in the congregation
[2221.84 --> 2225.28]  that the Spirit had made him aware of.
[2226.14 --> 2227.46]  He had spoken boldly
[2227.46 --> 2229.04]  to Ananias and Sapphira.
[2230.60 --> 2235.22]  He chastised Ananias for lying to the Holy Spirit
[2235.22 --> 2239.16]  and Sapphira for agreeing to test the Lord.
[2239.78 --> 2242.44]  And now God was answering the second petition
[2242.44 --> 2243.48]  that they had prayed,
[2243.82 --> 2246.08]  that God would stretch out his hand,
[2246.08 --> 2248.58]  not to kill,
[2248.58 --> 2249.54]  not to destroy,
[2249.64 --> 2250.36]  not to judge,
[2250.46 --> 2251.46]  but to heal,
[2253.46 --> 2257.10]  and to perform miraculous signs
[2257.10 --> 2259.76]  and wonders in the name of Jesus.
[2262.70 --> 2265.58]  They prayed that Jesus, as it were,
[2265.68 --> 2268.52]  would reach out his hand
[2268.52 --> 2270.74]  of mercy and grace.
[2270.74 --> 2274.88]  Do you see what God is doing here?
[2275.52 --> 2276.54]  He's showing that
[2276.54 --> 2278.90]  when the church is faithful,
[2279.90 --> 2282.62]  when its church takes sin seriously,
[2282.84 --> 2284.26]  he will bless her.
[2285.38 --> 2287.10]  He will answer her prayers.
[2288.48 --> 2290.12]  And that's exactly what happens.
[2290.26 --> 2293.02]  God performs miraculous signs and wonders.
[2293.02 --> 2296.26]  And again, remember,
[2296.62 --> 2299.06]  this is exactly what Jesus had promised
[2299.06 --> 2300.86]  before ascending into heaven.
[2301.20 --> 2301.94]  He had told them,
[2302.24 --> 2303.74]  after I ascend into heaven,
[2304.54 --> 2306.42]  he told them in Acts 1 verse 4,
[2306.50 --> 2308.02]  after I ascend into heaven,
[2309.14 --> 2310.42]  do not leave Jerusalem,
[2310.60 --> 2311.70]  but wait for the gift
[2311.70 --> 2312.92]  my Father has promised.
[2314.10 --> 2315.68]  And you know what that gift was?
[2315.80 --> 2317.44]  It was the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[2319.34 --> 2321.26]  Then remember what he told them next.
[2321.26 --> 2325.42]  You will receive power
[2325.42 --> 2329.46]  when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[2332.44 --> 2334.00]  What kind of power?
[2335.22 --> 2336.02]  Well, first of all,
[2336.08 --> 2337.58]  power to boldly proclaim
[2337.58 --> 2338.60]  the name of Jesus,
[2339.06 --> 2340.00]  the word of God,
[2340.60 --> 2342.34]  as Peter and John were doing,
[2342.62 --> 2344.26]  but also power to perform
[2345.12 --> 2346.90]  miraculous signs and wonders.
[2346.90 --> 2351.36]  Mark tells us at the end of his gospel
[2351.36 --> 2353.68]  that Jesus had promised the apostles
[2353.68 --> 2356.94]  that signs would accompany them.
[2358.20 --> 2359.86]  They would drive out demons.
[2360.48 --> 2362.12]  They would speak in new tongues
[2362.12 --> 2363.04]  and new languages.
[2363.72 --> 2366.50]  They would pick up snakes with their hands,
[2366.68 --> 2367.70]  poisonous snakes.
[2367.70 --> 2371.82]  They would even drink deadly poison
[2371.82 --> 2372.98]  without being hurt.
[2375.34 --> 2378.32]  They would place their hands on sick people
[2378.32 --> 2380.14]  so that they would be healed.
[2381.60 --> 2383.58]  And this is exactly the sort of thing
[2383.58 --> 2384.34]  that happens.
[2384.90 --> 2388.28]  We're told in verses 15 and 16
[2388.28 --> 2390.50]  that the apostles heal the sick.
[2390.76 --> 2392.54]  They cast out evil spirits
[2392.54 --> 2395.20]  and perform many miracles.
[2397.20 --> 2398.82]  Luke tells us, in fact,
[2398.90 --> 2401.14]  about all who came from the various towns
[2401.14 --> 2402.60]  around Jerusalem for healing.
[2403.24 --> 2404.90]  They heard what was going on
[2404.90 --> 2405.62]  and they came.
[2405.82 --> 2408.30]  And it says all of them were healed.
[2411.12 --> 2412.92]  Even those touched
[2412.92 --> 2415.22]  by Peter's shadow.
[2415.22 --> 2422.80]  Some Bible readers and commentators,
[2423.08 --> 2425.56]  they say, well, I don't know.
[2428.26 --> 2430.72]  Those touched by Peter's shadow were healed?
[2431.76 --> 2433.24]  They suggest that this was merely
[2433.24 --> 2435.12]  the wish of many,
[2435.72 --> 2438.02]  a wish rooted in pagan superstition.
[2440.22 --> 2442.68]  But let's take God at his word.
[2443.30 --> 2444.36]  This is what happened.
[2445.22 --> 2448.10]  Those touched even by Peter's shadow
[2448.10 --> 2449.12]  are healed.
[2450.42 --> 2452.18]  We have no reason to doubt it.
[2453.52 --> 2454.86]  This is God's work.
[2459.14 --> 2460.30]  In the first place,
[2460.36 --> 2462.44]  it's exactly what Luke reports
[2462.44 --> 2464.00]  at the end of verse 16.
[2464.12 --> 2465.26]  All of them were healed.
[2467.02 --> 2468.06]  And in the second place,
[2468.20 --> 2471.30]  remember that it is Jesus
[2471.30 --> 2473.10]  who is performing these miracles
[2473.10 --> 2473.74]  miracles.
[2473.74 --> 2474.62]  And that the apostles
[2474.62 --> 2475.94]  are merely his instruments.
[2476.14 --> 2477.98]  Jesus has ascended in heaven.
[2478.26 --> 2479.94]  He's been given all power
[2479.94 --> 2481.16]  and all authority
[2481.16 --> 2483.02]  in heaven and on earth.
[2483.42 --> 2485.24]  What can he not do?
[2485.24 --> 2489.96]  So what could prevent Jesus
[2489.96 --> 2491.18]  from healing those
[2491.18 --> 2493.70]  who catch Peter's shadow?
[2496.70 --> 2499.16]  If Jesus can perform miraculous signs
[2499.16 --> 2500.74]  and wonders from his throne in heaven,
[2500.84 --> 2502.26]  then he can surely do this
[2502.26 --> 2503.50]  through Peter's shadow
[2503.50 --> 2504.34]  if he so wishes.
[2504.34 --> 2507.38]  And after all,
[2507.44 --> 2509.52]  these are miraculous signs
[2509.52 --> 2510.78]  that he had promised.
[2513.84 --> 2515.44]  And this is not the first time,
[2515.52 --> 2516.58]  nor will it be the last.
[2516.66 --> 2518.44]  Remember that such things happened
[2518.44 --> 2520.42]  while Jesus was still with them.
[2521.30 --> 2523.34]  Remember the woman
[2523.34 --> 2524.20]  that we're told about,
[2524.30 --> 2526.78]  I think it's in Mark 5,
[2526.78 --> 2528.58]  who had been subject
[2528.58 --> 2530.76]  to bleeding for 12 years,
[2530.90 --> 2532.38]  who came up behind Jesus
[2532.38 --> 2534.04]  and merely touched
[2534.04 --> 2535.30]  the edge of his cloak
[2535.30 --> 2536.80]  and was healed.
[2538.94 --> 2540.46]  She had been to doctors.
[2540.62 --> 2542.14]  She had spent all her money
[2542.14 --> 2545.02]  for healing.
[2545.64 --> 2547.24]  But all she had to do
[2547.24 --> 2550.64]  was touch Jesus' cloak
[2550.64 --> 2551.58]  and she was healed
[2551.58 --> 2555.68]  from her 12-year illness.
[2556.78 --> 2558.98]  And miraculous healings
[2558.98 --> 2559.58]  of this nature
[2559.58 --> 2560.72]  would occur later
[2560.72 --> 2562.02]  through Paul as well.
[2562.98 --> 2564.38]  We're told in Acts 19,
[2564.50 --> 2564.98]  for example,
[2565.10 --> 2567.56]  that God did extraordinary miracles
[2567.56 --> 2568.24]  through Paul
[2568.24 --> 2570.14]  so that even handkerchiefs
[2570.14 --> 2572.00]  and aprons that had touched him
[2572.00 --> 2573.28]  were taken to the sick
[2573.28 --> 2575.52]  and their illnesses were cured
[2575.52 --> 2577.48]  and the evil spirits left them.
[2582.10 --> 2583.38]  Now what does this mean
[2583.38 --> 2585.10]  for you and me?
[2586.78 --> 2589.14]  in 2024.
[2592.08 --> 2592.64]  Well,
[2592.92 --> 2594.08]  in order to determine this,
[2594.14 --> 2594.74]  we should remember
[2594.74 --> 2596.70]  when these things took place,
[2597.70 --> 2600.12]  at what point
[2600.12 --> 2601.78]  in the history of redemption.
[2605.78 --> 2606.40]  Remember,
[2606.52 --> 2607.62]  Jesus had just descended
[2607.62 --> 2608.20]  into heaven
[2608.20 --> 2608.88]  and poured out
[2608.88 --> 2609.88]  his Holy Spirit
[2609.88 --> 2611.76]  and he had specifically
[2611.76 --> 2613.60]  promised his apostles
[2613.60 --> 2614.86]  that the power
[2614.86 --> 2615.62]  of the Holy Spirit
[2615.62 --> 2617.54]  would come upon them
[2617.54 --> 2620.48]  to speak the word of God boldly
[2620.48 --> 2622.16]  and to perform miracles.
[2624.84 --> 2626.88]  And he has not promised that
[2626.88 --> 2627.66]  to every believer,
[2628.62 --> 2630.50]  not even to every minister.
[2631.86 --> 2633.50]  He gave that promise
[2633.50 --> 2634.80]  to the apostles
[2634.80 --> 2636.06]  then and there
[2636.06 --> 2637.98]  because that's what
[2637.98 --> 2638.96]  the church needed
[2638.96 --> 2640.20]  at that point
[2640.20 --> 2641.08]  in her history,
[2641.36 --> 2642.92]  in her infancy.
[2645.08 --> 2646.46]  At the same time,
[2646.58 --> 2646.80]  however,
[2647.62 --> 2648.60]  the Spirit
[2648.60 --> 2649.34]  he poured out
[2649.34 --> 2650.64]  on the early church,
[2650.88 --> 2652.20]  he has poured out
[2652.20 --> 2654.40]  for and on us
[2654.40 --> 2655.06]  as well.
[2655.06 --> 2655.14]  Well,
[2655.36 --> 2659.96]  so you and I
[2659.96 --> 2663.14]  take courage.
[2663.14 --> 2666.96]  we pray
[2666.96 --> 2667.88]  for the Spirit
[2667.88 --> 2670.30]  with the same zeal
[2670.30 --> 2670.84]  and passion
[2670.84 --> 2672.14]  as those first believers.
[2672.60 --> 2674.20]  We ask for the Holy Spirit
[2674.20 --> 2675.24]  to fill us
[2675.24 --> 2676.42]  with his boldness.
[2677.72 --> 2678.88]  We ask God
[2678.88 --> 2680.24]  to stretch out his hand
[2680.24 --> 2681.36]  and do mighty things
[2681.36 --> 2682.28]  in our day
[2682.28 --> 2683.74]  and in our time.
[2690.78 --> 2691.98]  With Habakkuk.
[2693.14 --> 2694.80]  you know,
[2694.86 --> 2695.56]  I often wonder
[2695.56 --> 2696.38]  about myself
[2696.38 --> 2697.32]  and you may often
[2697.32 --> 2698.34]  wonder the same thing
[2698.34 --> 2699.10]  about yourself.
[2703.30 --> 2704.38]  How can I,
[2706.54 --> 2707.86]  the insignificant
[2707.86 --> 2709.18]  and insufficient person
[2709.18 --> 2709.88]  that I am,
[2711.88 --> 2713.32]  even on my best days,
[2714.78 --> 2716.52]  accomplish anything good,
[2717.42 --> 2718.66]  anything worthwhile,
[2718.80 --> 2720.50]  let alone anything great?
[2720.50 --> 2726.16]  and you and I
[2726.16 --> 2726.88]  may feel like
[2726.88 --> 2727.58]  all we can do
[2727.58 --> 2728.12]  really is
[2728.12 --> 2729.48]  maybe cast a shadow
[2729.48 --> 2732.56]  and in the summer
[2732.56 --> 2734.16]  maybe a little longer shadow,
[2734.30 --> 2734.46]  but
[2734.46 --> 2736.28]  that's about it.
[2738.08 --> 2738.58]  Or
[2738.58 --> 2740.52]  perhaps we can fall
[2740.52 --> 2741.40]  into the shadow
[2741.40 --> 2742.76]  of the spiritual giants
[2742.76 --> 2743.64]  of the past
[2743.64 --> 2745.32]  and
[2745.32 --> 2748.00]  few in the present.
[2752.00 --> 2753.94]  But even if that is so,
[2755.14 --> 2756.82]  God can and will
[2756.82 --> 2758.96]  accomplish great
[2758.96 --> 2760.00]  things
[2760.00 --> 2760.88]  in our day,
[2761.88 --> 2763.32]  in our time.
[2763.98 --> 2764.82]  He will.
[2766.10 --> 2767.06]  He is.
[2767.06 --> 2773.92]  In fact,
[2774.12 --> 2774.58]  he says
[2774.58 --> 2775.64]  that that's exactly
[2775.64 --> 2776.86]  how he gets things done,
[2777.40 --> 2778.50]  by using
[2778.50 --> 2779.16]  even the weakest
[2779.16 --> 2780.56]  things of the world,
[2780.66 --> 2781.28]  as Paul says
[2781.28 --> 2782.14]  in 1 Corinthians,
[2783.14 --> 2785.30]  such as
[2785.30 --> 2785.74]  the shadow
[2785.74 --> 2786.34]  of Peter
[2786.34 --> 2790.60]  and Theo
[2790.60 --> 2791.68]  and you.
[2791.68 --> 2795.42]  there's something else
[2795.42 --> 2796.50]  about Peter's shadow.
[2797.04 --> 2798.04]  Where there is a shadow,
[2798.24 --> 2799.32]  there must be
[2799.32 --> 2801.30]  what?
[2803.06 --> 2803.54]  Light.
[2807.74 --> 2808.82]  Where there's a shadow,
[2808.92 --> 2809.86]  there must be light.
[2810.22 --> 2811.40]  And the shadow of Peter
[2811.40 --> 2812.04]  directs us
[2812.04 --> 2813.04]  not to Peter,
[2813.78 --> 2814.72]  but to the light
[2814.72 --> 2815.50]  who creates
[2815.50 --> 2816.22]  his shadow.
[2817.68 --> 2818.96]  And who is that?
[2818.96 --> 2822.50]  It's Jesus Christ,
[2823.26 --> 2824.78]  the light of the world,
[2824.92 --> 2826.16]  the sun of righteousness,
[2827.24 --> 2828.28]  shining in all
[2828.28 --> 2829.14]  his radiance.
[2831.02 --> 2832.26]  Peter's shadow
[2832.26 --> 2832.86]  healed
[2832.86 --> 2833.58]  because it was
[2833.58 --> 2834.24]  the light
[2834.24 --> 2835.24]  and power
[2835.24 --> 2836.12]  of Christ
[2836.12 --> 2837.14]  that was shining
[2837.14 --> 2838.50]  on him.
[2842.00 --> 2843.38]  So what is the secret?
[2845.30 --> 2846.28]  Well, I think
[2846.28 --> 2847.28]  it's simply this.
[2848.96 --> 2851.68]  get into the light.
[2856.24 --> 2857.38]  Get as close
[2857.38 --> 2857.98]  as you can
[2857.98 --> 2858.70]  to the source
[2858.70 --> 2859.22]  of the light,
[2859.36 --> 2860.24]  Jesus Christ.
[2862.30 --> 2863.46]  So that those
[2863.46 --> 2864.66]  around you
[2864.66 --> 2865.70]  sense that
[2865.70 --> 2866.62]  he is present.
[2868.78 --> 2869.86]  So that people
[2869.86 --> 2871.12]  around you
[2871.12 --> 2871.82]  experience
[2871.82 --> 2872.40]  the comfort
[2872.40 --> 2873.00]  and healing
[2873.00 --> 2873.62]  of Jesus
[2873.62 --> 2875.48]  simply
[2875.48 --> 2878.02]  by your presence.
[2878.96 --> 2883.52]  they sense
[2883.52 --> 2884.44]  his warmth,
[2884.96 --> 2887.36]  his grace,
[2888.16 --> 2890.32]  his love
[2890.32 --> 2893.24]  through you
[2893.24 --> 2896.18]  just because
[2896.18 --> 2896.70]  you're standing
[2896.70 --> 2897.40]  in his light.
[2897.40 --> 2902.34]  great fear
[2902.34 --> 2902.90]  makes way
[2902.90 --> 2903.36]  for great
[2903.36 --> 2903.88]  flourishing.
[2904.00 --> 2904.36]  We see that
[2904.36 --> 2904.88]  in the miracles
[2904.88 --> 2905.64]  of the apostles
[2905.64 --> 2906.62]  and also
[2906.62 --> 2907.28]  in the fellowship
[2907.28 --> 2908.08]  of the believers.
[2908.34 --> 2908.70]  Satan has
[2908.70 --> 2909.28]  launched a
[2909.28 --> 2910.22]  serious attack
[2910.22 --> 2911.40]  on the body
[2911.40 --> 2912.02]  of believers
[2912.02 --> 2913.18]  through the sin
[2913.18 --> 2913.94]  of Ananias
[2913.94 --> 2914.54]  and Sapphira.
[2914.62 --> 2915.50]  You can imagine
[2915.50 --> 2916.70]  what that must
[2916.70 --> 2917.16]  have done
[2917.16 --> 2919.00]  to their fellowship.
[2919.00 --> 2921.46]  But the Holy
[2921.46 --> 2922.00]  Spirit has
[2922.00 --> 2923.34]  preserved the
[2923.34 --> 2923.76]  unity and
[2923.76 --> 2924.22]  the fellowship
[2924.22 --> 2924.98]  of the believers.
[2925.50 --> 2926.24]  Luke tells us,
[2926.44 --> 2927.04]  he reports
[2927.04 --> 2927.48]  at the end
[2927.48 --> 2928.14]  of verse 12,
[2928.28 --> 2929.06]  all the believers
[2929.06 --> 2930.14]  used to meet
[2930.14 --> 2931.26]  together in
[2931.26 --> 2932.34]  Solomon's colonnade.
[2933.74 --> 2935.12]  And a closer
[2935.12 --> 2936.00]  reading of that
[2936.00 --> 2937.40]  suggests something
[2937.40 --> 2938.30]  along these lines.
[2938.44 --> 2939.14]  All the believers
[2939.14 --> 2940.58]  continued meeting
[2940.58 --> 2941.44]  in Solomon's
[2941.44 --> 2942.00]  colonnade.
[2942.00 --> 2943.98]  Satan's goal
[2943.98 --> 2944.42]  was to
[2944.42 --> 2946.16]  get them
[2946.16 --> 2947.40]  separated.
[2948.36 --> 2949.54]  To stop them
[2949.54 --> 2950.18]  from gathering
[2950.18 --> 2950.68]  together.
[2951.22 --> 2952.44]  To destroy
[2952.44 --> 2953.18]  their fellowship.
[2955.14 --> 2956.08]  Because he knew
[2956.08 --> 2956.74]  how powerful
[2956.74 --> 2957.58]  that fellowship
[2957.58 --> 2958.10]  is.
[2960.20 --> 2961.24]  That's the point
[2961.24 --> 2961.70]  of the beginning
[2961.70 --> 2962.40]  of this chapter.
[2962.56 --> 2963.06]  When sin is
[2963.06 --> 2963.98]  properly dealt
[2963.98 --> 2965.06]  within and by
[2965.06 --> 2965.68]  the church
[2965.68 --> 2966.84]  under the guidance
[2966.84 --> 2967.82]  and at the initiative
[2967.82 --> 2969.14]  of God-appointed
[2969.14 --> 2969.66]  leaders,
[2970.14 --> 2970.84]  then blessings
[2970.84 --> 2971.82]  will follow.
[2972.00 --> 2976.46]  Church discipline,
[2976.62 --> 2977.04]  you see,
[2978.16 --> 2979.22]  doesn't threaten
[2979.22 --> 2979.86]  the fellowship
[2979.86 --> 2980.68]  of the believers.
[2981.72 --> 2982.70]  Even though we
[2982.70 --> 2983.60]  may imagine
[2983.60 --> 2984.68]  many ways
[2984.68 --> 2985.28]  it might,
[2986.44 --> 2987.06]  church discipline
[2987.06 --> 2988.32]  actually strengthens
[2988.32 --> 2989.12]  and protects
[2989.12 --> 2989.90]  the precious
[2989.90 --> 2990.72]  fellowship of
[2990.72 --> 2991.46]  the Holy Spirit.
[2994.46 --> 2995.34]  And that's
[2995.34 --> 2995.74]  what we see
[2995.74 --> 2996.40]  happening here.
[2997.18 --> 2997.78]  Great fear
[2997.78 --> 2998.58]  makes way
[2998.58 --> 2999.90]  for great flourishing.
[3002.56 --> 3003.80]  We also see that
[3003.80 --> 3004.96]  not only in the
[3004.96 --> 3005.56]  miracles of the
[3005.56 --> 3006.40]  apostles and the
[3006.40 --> 3007.10]  fellowship of the
[3007.10 --> 3007.38]  believers,
[3007.58 --> 3008.16]  but also in the
[3008.16 --> 3008.90]  reaction of the
[3008.90 --> 3009.30]  crowds.
[3012.88 --> 3013.78]  In the faithful
[3013.78 --> 3014.72]  and obedient church
[3014.72 --> 3015.48]  where God's word
[3015.48 --> 3016.16]  is obeyed and
[3016.16 --> 3016.66]  where church
[3016.66 --> 3017.36]  discipline is
[3017.36 --> 3017.98]  operative,
[3018.62 --> 3019.60]  there is not only
[3019.60 --> 3020.60]  a beautiful unity,
[3021.16 --> 3022.04]  there is also a
[3022.04 --> 3023.26]  powerful outreach.
[3023.26 --> 3023.32]  change.
[3025.88 --> 3027.28]  The apostles and
[3027.28 --> 3028.18]  believers have an
[3028.18 --> 3029.98]  outward focus.
[3032.72 --> 3034.36]  The apostles perform
[3034.36 --> 3035.66]  miraculous signs and
[3035.66 --> 3036.80]  wonders among the
[3036.80 --> 3038.14]  people, but notice
[3038.14 --> 3040.98]  that it is in the
[3040.98 --> 3041.78]  general public.
[3041.78 --> 3041.82]  public.
[3042.62 --> 3043.62]  It's for all to
[3043.62 --> 3043.92]  see.
[3044.90 --> 3045.38]  And everyone
[3045.38 --> 3046.14]  hears about it.
[3046.48 --> 3048.54]  In fact, it's so
[3048.54 --> 3049.70]  public and so many
[3049.70 --> 3050.48]  people hear about it
[3050.48 --> 3051.02]  that people are
[3051.02 --> 3051.80]  coming from all over
[3051.80 --> 3054.22]  the place to
[3054.22 --> 3055.04]  witness it and to
[3055.04 --> 3055.74]  be part of it.
[3057.08 --> 3058.36]  And more and more
[3058.36 --> 3059.24]  men and women
[3059.24 --> 3061.98]  join the church.
[3062.46 --> 3063.38]  People from all
[3063.38 --> 3064.20]  over the place
[3064.20 --> 3066.22]  come to Jerusalem
[3066.22 --> 3069.10]  just to see the
[3069.10 --> 3070.04]  church, to see the
[3070.04 --> 3070.98]  apostles and what
[3070.98 --> 3071.54]  they're doing,
[3072.64 --> 3073.24]  bringing their
[3073.24 --> 3073.92]  sick to them.
[3077.20 --> 3078.72]  Let's take a
[3078.72 --> 3079.92]  little closer look
[3079.92 --> 3081.86]  at the reaction
[3081.86 --> 3082.48]  of the crowd.
[3082.82 --> 3083.14]  In the first
[3083.14 --> 3083.96]  place, Luke tells
[3083.96 --> 3084.94]  us in verse 13
[3084.94 --> 3086.06]  that no one else
[3086.06 --> 3087.72]  dared to join
[3087.72 --> 3088.80]  them even though
[3088.80 --> 3089.48]  they were highly
[3089.48 --> 3090.36]  regarded by the
[3090.36 --> 3090.68]  people.
[3095.16 --> 3095.96]  No one else
[3095.96 --> 3096.66]  dared to join
[3096.66 --> 3097.20]  them even though
[3097.20 --> 3097.76]  they were highly
[3097.76 --> 3098.54]  regarded by the
[3098.54 --> 3098.80]  people.
[3099.80 --> 3100.64]  From a purely
[3100.64 --> 3101.64]  secular human
[3101.64 --> 3102.42]  perspective, we
[3102.42 --> 3103.12]  might view this
[3103.12 --> 3104.18]  as a problem, but
[3104.18 --> 3105.28]  we shouldn't.
[3106.30 --> 3106.84]  For in the first
[3106.84 --> 3108.02]  place, this is an
[3108.02 --> 3109.02]  indication that the
[3109.02 --> 3109.90]  outsiders have a
[3109.90 --> 3111.40]  healthy respect for
[3111.40 --> 3112.22]  the holiness of
[3112.22 --> 3113.06]  God's church.
[3117.12 --> 3118.24]  People realize that
[3118.24 --> 3119.02]  they cannot just
[3119.02 --> 3120.62]  casually venture into
[3120.62 --> 3121.68]  the fellowship of the
[3121.68 --> 3122.94]  church or form a
[3122.94 --> 3123.64]  merely outward
[3123.64 --> 3125.32]  connection with the
[3125.32 --> 3125.66]  believers.
[3125.66 --> 3128.10]  This is a
[3128.10 --> 3130.56]  holy assembly
[3130.56 --> 3135.26]  where holy God
[3135.26 --> 3135.66]  dwells.
[3142.66 --> 3143.96]  We, too, experience
[3143.96 --> 3144.90]  that sort of reaction
[3144.90 --> 3145.98]  from time to time, I
[3145.98 --> 3146.64]  think, don't we?
[3148.46 --> 3149.56]  Sometimes people are
[3149.56 --> 3151.62]  reluctant to join the
[3151.62 --> 3153.36]  church because they see
[3153.36 --> 3154.42]  what is happening
[3154.42 --> 3154.78]  there.
[3159.18 --> 3160.34]  We shouldn't see that
[3160.34 --> 3160.94]  as a bad thing.
[3161.00 --> 3161.80]  It's actually a good
[3161.80 --> 3162.10]  thing.
[3162.86 --> 3163.94]  We don't need to be
[3163.94 --> 3165.00]  embarrassed when people
[3165.00 --> 3166.28]  discover that we take
[3166.28 --> 3167.96]  the holiness of God and
[3167.96 --> 3169.28]  his church seriously.
[3170.28 --> 3172.84]  If we do not take God
[3172.84 --> 3176.90]  seriously and his
[3176.90 --> 3180.18]  holiness, how can we
[3180.18 --> 3181.18]  expect others to?
[3183.04 --> 3184.10]  But then notice what
[3184.10 --> 3185.14]  else Luke tells us,
[3185.20 --> 3186.42]  which is fascinating.
[3187.56 --> 3188.44]  It's almost like a
[3188.44 --> 3188.86]  switch.
[3190.60 --> 3194.32]  Nevertheless, more and
[3194.32 --> 3196.38]  more men and women
[3196.38 --> 3198.52]  believed in the Lord and
[3198.52 --> 3199.58]  were added to their
[3199.58 --> 3199.88]  number.
[3200.00 --> 3201.52]  I believe this is a
[3201.52 --> 3202.72]  miraculous sign, too.
[3207.72 --> 3209.20]  People do not dare to
[3209.20 --> 3209.76]  join them.
[3212.64 --> 3214.10]  And yet they join them
[3214.10 --> 3218.76]  because God's spirit is
[3218.76 --> 3222.24]  clearly at work, giving
[3222.24 --> 3225.04]  them courage to become
[3225.04 --> 3225.92]  believers and join
[3225.92 --> 3226.74]  Christ's church.
[3228.94 --> 3230.74]  The grace and mercy of
[3230.74 --> 3233.02]  God towards us are more
[3233.02 --> 3234.50]  powerful than our fears
[3234.50 --> 3236.26]  and misgivings of him.
[3236.26 --> 3238.50]  You know how both Jesus
[3238.50 --> 3241.30]  and the apostles, and how
[3241.30 --> 3242.62]  Jesus and the apostle Paul
[3242.62 --> 3244.68]  speak about God pruning
[3244.68 --> 3245.52]  his church.
[3245.90 --> 3247.36]  God cuts out the dead
[3247.36 --> 3249.58]  branches from his vine and
[3249.58 --> 3251.52]  throws them into the fire so
[3251.52 --> 3252.62]  that the vine will be
[3252.62 --> 3253.10]  healthy.
[3254.90 --> 3256.26]  The branches of the olive
[3256.26 --> 3258.02]  tree that bear bad fruit are
[3258.02 --> 3259.60]  broken off so that the
[3259.60 --> 3261.44]  productive branches can be
[3261.44 --> 3262.38]  grafted in.
[3262.38 --> 3266.80]  For a tree or a vine to
[3266.80 --> 3268.00]  flourish, it needs to be
[3268.00 --> 3268.34]  pruned.
[3270.44 --> 3273.40]  Jesus prunes his vine ever so
[3273.40 --> 3277.32]  lovingly, his olive tree,
[3278.32 --> 3281.72]  because he wants his bride,
[3281.72 --> 3284.56]  the church to flourish.
[3291.68 --> 3292.88]  Be filled with the Holy
[3292.88 --> 3294.12]  Spirit, brothers and
[3294.12 --> 3297.10]  sisters, and pray that the
[3297.10 --> 3298.56]  Holy Spirit will continue to
[3298.56 --> 3302.80]  fill you and fill this
[3302.80 --> 3303.36]  church.
[3306.72 --> 3308.26]  Pray that he will give you
[3308.26 --> 3311.08]  boldness and courage to make
[3311.08 --> 3312.40]  known the name of Jesus,
[3313.04 --> 3316.38]  that he will continue to do
[3316.38 --> 3319.42]  great things.
[3322.30 --> 3324.70]  And then expect him, and then
[3324.70 --> 3326.40]  expect things to happen.
[3330.30 --> 3331.90]  Pray that through you, wherever
[3331.90 --> 3336.34]  your shadow falls, wherever you
[3336.34 --> 3337.22]  are present.
[3339.44 --> 3343.58]  Christ Jesus may be present with
[3343.58 --> 3345.80]  his healing light and power,
[3346.96 --> 3349.58]  with his comfort, grace, mercy,
[3350.58 --> 3354.24]  and eternal salvation.
[3355.82 --> 3356.94]  Let us pray.
[3356.94 --> 3360.38]  Lord our God,
[3361.94 --> 3366.16]  in wrath remember mercy.
[3370.16 --> 3374.14]  In our day and in our time,
[3375.64 --> 3378.24]  do these things.
[3379.52 --> 3382.46]  Through us, for your glory.
[3384.20 --> 3384.88]  Amen.
[3386.94 --> 3408.00]  Amen.
[3408.00 --> 3410.02]  Amen.
[3410.26 --> 3410.30]  Amen.
[3410.30 --> 3414.00]  Amen.
[3414.00 --> 3433.76]  Life falls on in endless song that offers lamentation.
[3433.76 --> 3441.76]  I catch the sweet love for a flame that feels under creation.
[3441.76 --> 3449.76]  No stone can shake my inmost home, but to that rock I'm clinging.
[3449.76 --> 3459.76]  Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth, how can I keep the drum singing?
[3459.76 --> 3471.76]  Through all that tumultuous strife, I hear that music ringing.
[3471.76 --> 3481.76]  It finds an echo in my soul, how can I keep from singing?
[3481.76 --> 3489.76]  No stones can shake my inmost home, but to that rock I'm clinging.
[3489.76 --> 3499.76]  Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth, how can I keep from singing?
[3499.76 --> 3509.76]  No stones can shake my inmost home, but to that rock I'm clinging.
[3509.76 --> 3513.76]  No stones can shake my inmost home, but to that rock I'm clinging.
[3513.76 --> 3516.96]  All the darkness gather round,
[3516.96 --> 3520.96]  suns in the night and river.
[3520.96 --> 3525.46]  The storm can shed my eyeballs fall,
[3525.46 --> 3529.46]  a tear left from unclean aid.
[3529.46 --> 3533.76]  Since first does the hell ever end,
[3533.76 --> 3538.76]  how can I keep you from saving?
[3543.76 --> 3548.76]  The peace of Christ gives fresh my heart,
[3548.76 --> 3552.76]  and fountain of us may name.
[3552.76 --> 3556.76]  How things are mine since I am His,
[3556.76 --> 3560.76]  and when I came to sing.
[3560.76 --> 3564.76]  The storm can shed my eyeballs fall,
[3564.76 --> 3568.76]  a tear left from unclean aid.
[3568.76 --> 3572.76]  Since first is Lord of heaven and earth,
[3572.76 --> 3578.76]  how can it keep them saving?
[3578.76 --> 3583.76]  The Lord of heaven.
[3583.76 --> 3587.76]  The Lord of heaven.
[3587.76 --> 3594.76]  Our offering today is for one book.
[3594.76 --> 3601.76]  It's the ministry that we support for Bible translation around the world.
[3601.76 --> 3606.76]  And I just want to mention one thing as the deacons come forward for our offering.
[3606.76 --> 3613.76]  These organizations and ministries that we support are deeply grateful for our financial support and prayers.
[3613.76 --> 3623.76]  And there is a number of letters on the bulletin board just outside the sanctuary door expressing the thanks that many of these organizations want us to know.
[3623.76 --> 3625.76]  So have a read sometime.
[3625.76 --> 3628.76]  Our offering is for one book.
[3628.76 --> 3640.76]  Women, 2015
[3640.76 --> 3641.76]  Women, 2015
[3641.76 --> 3643.76]  Amen.
[3671.76 --> 3673.76]  Amen.
[3701.76 --> 3703.76]  Amen.
[3731.76 --> 3733.76]  Amen.
[3761.76 --> 3763.76]  Amen.
[3791.76 --> 3793.76]  Amen.
[3821.76 --> 3823.76]  Amen.
[3851.76 --> 3853.76]  Amen.
[3853.76 --> 3855.76]  Amen.
[3855.76 --> 3858.76]  I'm going to be offering our community prayer.
[3858.76 --> 3864.76]  I wanted to mention that Abbas Sarjulunajad's father passed away this last week in Iran.
[3864.76 --> 3871.76]  Of course, Abbas can't travel because he can't legally go back to Iran, but we will remember
[3871.76 --> 3874.76]  the family in our prayers.
[3874.76 --> 3877.76]  Let us pray.
[3877.76 --> 3885.76]  O great God, indeed, great is thy faithfulness.
[3885.76 --> 3887.76]  Glorify yourself in all the earth, Lord.
[3887.76 --> 3890.76]  Be glorified in creation.
[3890.76 --> 3892.76]  Be glorified in your church.
[3892.76 --> 3896.76]  Be glorified in our worship here this morning.
[3896.76 --> 3902.76]  Though we are so small and you are so grand, help us nevertheless to magnify your name.
[3902.76 --> 3910.76]  Help us to make your name and the nature of your grace larger and easier for people to see.
[3910.76 --> 3914.76]  Move us from fear to flourishing.
[3914.76 --> 3920.76]  We are thankful for the communities we live in, for services which we sometimes take for granted.
[3920.76 --> 3928.76]  For clean water, for public servants such as police, doctors, judges, nurses, firefighters, and paramedics.
[3928.76 --> 3931.76]  May we be mindful of all these services we have.
[3931.76 --> 3936.76]  Bless all the workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[3936.76 --> 3946.76]  We pray for those who work in agriculture, including farmers in our church, who provide us with the daily necessities of life.
[3946.76 --> 3949.76]  We are thankful for your provision in this world.
[3949.76 --> 3953.76]  May we be good stewards of your creation.
[3953.76 --> 3962.76]  In this season of wildfires, we ask for your protection of all firefighters.
[3962.76 --> 3966.76]  And for all those affected by these dangers.
[3966.76 --> 3971.76]  And Lord, we cry out for rain.
[3971.76 --> 3978.76]  We pray for our nation, for our prime minister, our premier, and the mayors from the communities we represent.
[3978.76 --> 3983.76]  Give them a sense of justice and provide them with wisdom for leadership.
[3983.76 --> 3986.76]  We pray for a broken world.
[3986.76 --> 3992.76]  For Christians around this world, protect your church universal.
[3992.76 --> 3997.76]  Where there is war, seemingly endless war, we cry out to you.
[3997.76 --> 4002.76]  Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating violence to bring it to an end.
[4002.76 --> 4012.76]  Because of conflict, hunger, drought, and climate change, more and more people are becoming refugees.
[4012.76 --> 4018.76]  We pray for those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[4018.76 --> 4025.76]  Bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable problems.
[4025.76 --> 4032.76]  We pray for the nations as we see a rise in authoritarian power in many countries.
[4032.76 --> 4036.76]  We pray for our church.
[4036.76 --> 4038.76]  Bless our ministry leaders.
[4038.76 --> 4041.76]  Bless Pastor Jason and our church council.
[4041.76 --> 4045.76]  Also the volunteers who are leading our many programs.
[4045.76 --> 4049.76]  Continue to bless the work of Pastor Nancy and the Chinese ministry.
[4049.76 --> 4057.76]  May we continue to grow together so that we become one body, getting to know each other better.
[4057.76 --> 4064.76]  We pray for the ministries of the Christian Reformed Church, our denomination, and our classes.
[4064.76 --> 4072.76]  We ask you to bless our missionaries, Howard and Yanni Johnson, among the indigenous in the Okanagan,
[4072.76 --> 4075.76]  along with their son Tim and his wife Charity.
[4075.76 --> 4079.76]  For Najee Umran and Ann Zaki, serving in Cairo.
[4079.76 --> 4083.76]  For Hannah Vanderkamp in Lesbos.
[4083.76 --> 4086.76]  For Todd Statham at UBC Okanagan.
[4086.76 --> 4090.76]  And Gary Rosma with Ministry to Seafarers.
[4090.76 --> 4092.76]  Encourage all of them.
[4092.76 --> 4093.76]  Help them.
[4093.76 --> 4096.76]  Help us to remember to pray for them.
[4096.76 --> 4100.76]  We want to bring before you the needs of our congregation.
[4100.76 --> 4103.76]  For those seniors living in care homes.
[4103.76 --> 4108.76]  For shut-ins and those who are struggling with physical or emotional issues.
[4108.76 --> 4112.76]  For strength in marriages and families.
[4112.76 --> 4115.76]  For care for those who are single.
[4115.76 --> 4118.76]  For all who may be lonely.
[4118.76 --> 4123.76]  We ask you to be close to Pat Bauman as she struggles with kidney disease.
[4123.76 --> 4129.76]  We pray for healing and we thank you too, Lord, that Kakuya Arga is doing well.
[4129.76 --> 4134.76]  We pray for his complete healing.
[4134.76 --> 4137.76]  We pray too for Grace and George.
[4137.76 --> 4140.76]  And we are happy that they are progressing.
[4140.76 --> 4146.76]  We pray especially this morning for Abbas Sargilunajad and Violet Bazzadian.
[4146.76 --> 4148.76]  As they mourn the passing of Abbas's father.
[4148.76 --> 4152.76]  Abbas and Violet are so far from their home country of Iran.
[4152.76 --> 4159.76]  And cannot mourn with family there.
[4159.76 --> 4162.76]  Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name.
[4162.76 --> 4165.76]  And give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer.
[4165.76 --> 4169.76]  And to live faithfully in response to your call.
[4169.76 --> 4173.76]  Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[4173.76 --> 4196.76]  Now rise to receive God's benediction.
[4196.76 --> 4205.76]  As we receive God's benediction, let us remember that God blesses us so that we will be a blessing.
[4205.76 --> 4211.76]  So as you receive this blessing, go out into the world to be his blessing in the world.
[4211.76 --> 4216.76]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4216.76 --> 4219.76]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4219.76 --> 4223.76]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[4223.76 --> 4226.76]  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[4226.76 --> 4227.76]  Amen.
[4227.76 --> 4228.76]  Amen.
[4228.76 --> 4240.76]  Our Lord bless now.
[4240.76 --> 4250.46]  We born here to
[4250.72 --> 4255.76]  Salvation belongs to our God
[4255.76 --> 4261.70]  Who sits upon the throne of all
[4261.70 --> 4265.38]  And come to the Lamb
[4265.38 --> 4267.86]  Praise His glory
[4267.86 --> 4270.24]  Praise them at thanks
[4270.24 --> 4274.94]  Father and Father will stay
[4274.94 --> 4279.88]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4279.88 --> 4284.66]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4284.66 --> 4289.36]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4289.36 --> 4299.00]  And we the redeemed shall be strong
[4299.00 --> 4303.66]  In purpose and unity
[4303.66 --> 4308.72]  Declaring our love
[4308.72 --> 4311.06]  Praise and glory
[4311.06 --> 4313.64]  Risen in thanks
[4313.64 --> 4317.76]  Honor and power and strength
[4317.76 --> 4323.36]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4323.36 --> 4328.26]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4328.26 --> 4332.96]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4332.96 --> 4333.96]  Amen
[4333.96 --> 4338.96]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4338.96 --> 4342.96]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4342.96 --> 4347.66]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4347.66 --> 4352.66]  Be to our God forever and ever
[4352.66 --> 4353.66]  Amen
[4353.66 --> 4354.66]  Amen
[4354.66 --> 4356.36]  Amen
[4356.62 --> 4358.36]  Amen
[4358.36 --> 4359.36]  Amen
[4359.36 --> 4371.66]  Amen
[4371.66 --> 4372.40]  Amen
[4372.40 --> 4372.74]  Amen
[4372.74 --> 4373.54]  Amen
[4373.54 --> 4375.50]  Amen
[4375.50 --> 4375.80]  Amen
[4376.34 --> 4377.34]  Amen
[4377.34 --> 4378.12]  Amen
[4378.12 --> 4379.08]  Amen
[4379.08 --> 4379.30]  Amen
[4379.30 --> 4379.86]  Amen
[4379.86 --> 4381.14]  Amen
[4381.14 --> 4381.40]  Amen
[4381.40 --> 4381.98]  Amen
[4381.98 --> 4382.40]  Amen
[4382.40 --> 4382.68]  Amen
[4382.68 --> 4383.08]  Amen
[4383.26 --> 4384.24]  Amen
