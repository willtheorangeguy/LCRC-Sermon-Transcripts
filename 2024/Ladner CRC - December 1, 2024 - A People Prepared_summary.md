• The angel Gabriel appears to Zechariah in the temple, announcing the birth of John and his purpose as a Nazarite and precursor to Christ
• The story of Zechariah and Elizabeth's pregnancy and seclusion
• The connection between their story and the lives of those listening today
• Introduction to Zechariah and Elizabeth, an elderly couple from a priestly line
• Their righteousness before God, but with original sin and personal missteps
• Their unmet desire for children due to Elizabeth's inability to conceive and their advanced age
• The significance of children in the first century Jewish culture as a means of participating in God's story and ensuring future care in old age
• Zechariah and Elizabeth's heartache is not just an unmet desire, but also the loss of a future hope for themselves
• Zechariah and Elizabeth's story as a reflection on unmet longings and disappointments
• It is possible to be faithful to God and still experience disappointment
• Unmet longings can lead to feelings of being cursed or judged by God
• Places where people feel disappointment and unmet longings (family, work, retirement, money, health)
• The importance of trusting in God in the midst of unmet desires
• Others around us may also be experiencing private places of emptiness and unmet longings
• The voice of God is most needed in places of disappointment and longing
• Zechariah and Elizabeth are examples of those who need to hear the voice of God in their lives
• Places of unmet longings can be considered "places of preparation" where Christ meets us and speaks to us
• The path of preparation involves acknowledging and walking through these places with God
• As seen in Zechariah's story, being ready to meet God in those places is not always simple
• Zechariah's job is to burn incense on the altar of incense twice a day
• He must enter and leave the holy place quickly, without lingering or getting distracted
• The atmosphere inside the temple would be quiet, dimly lit, and filled with the smell of incense
• Zechariah would remember the weight of his responsibility and the importance of showing respect to God

• Analysis of Zechariah's struggle to believe the good news and Gabriel's response in verse 19
• Discussion of Gabriel's identity and authority as an angel who stands in God's presence
• Zechariah struggles to believe the angel's promise of a child
• Zechariah has given up hope and is not expecting an answer to his prayers
• He may feel it's painful and burdensome to maintain hope after waiting for so long
• A second reason for his disbelief could be that he didn't have to do anything to receive the promise, making it harder to accept
• The angel's task or action might make it easier for Zechariah to believe and accept the promise
• Zechariah's initial reaction to being told he would have a son
• The difficulty of swallowing the news without a request or condition
• Zechariah's faith not being lost, but rather his heart becoming empty and bitter
• The discipline of God for Zechariah being forced silence due to his struggle to listen and believe
• The purpose of the discipline being for Zechariah to learn to listen to the voice of God
• Trusting God is a process that requires learning and growth
• God's promises are kept despite human unbelief or inconsistency in faith
• Faith itself does not save, but rather the dependability of what one puts faith in
• God is dependable and faithful, and His character cannot be denied
• Temporary discipline may come as a result of lapses in faith, but it is for growth and to help trust Christ
• The purpose of preparation is to learn to trust God and receive Him into areas of unmet desires.
• The angel Gabriel foretells the birth of a special child who will bring many people back to God
• The child will have the spirit and power of Elijah, turning hearts to their children and making people prepared for the Lord
• The child is a prophet of God and the answer to Elizabeth and Zechariah's prayers
• The prophecy foretells that when the new Elijah comes, the next person to appear will be God himself
• The Jews thought Elijah would return literally, but he was taken up into heaven without dying an earthly death
• John the Baptist's role in redemptive history as a forerunner to Christ
• The fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy through John the Baptist and his work
• Preparing people for the coming of Christ, including the speaker's current preparation
• Christ's meeting with individuals in their places of longing and unmet desire
• God's greater gift being himself, rather than a specific answer or solution to human problems
• Elizabeth's testimony in Luke 1:25 about God's favor and redemption from shame
• Shame of being cut off from God's story
• Christ's coming to take away personal and global disgrace
• Purpose of Advent: preparation for Jesus to meet our unmet longings and desires
• Filling us with himself, replacing emptiness, doubt, fear, and disbelief with trust and faith
• The importance of declaring the message of Jesus Christ to the world
• The deep wounds and pains experienced by all people can be met in Jesus Christ
• Prayer is called for, with a moment of silence to respond to a passage and pray
