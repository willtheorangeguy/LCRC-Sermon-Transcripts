[255.00 → 256.00] Good morning, everyone.
[256.00 → 257.00] Good morning.
[257.00 → 263.00] Welcome to our Sunday worship service here at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[263.00 → 269.00] And if you are new with us this morning, we are especially glad for you to join us and for all of us,
[269.00 → 274.00] all of you, welcome, and I'm glad to be here with you today.
[274.00 → 275.00] My name is Jason True.
[275.00 → 279.00] I'll be leading us through our worship this morning.
[279.00 → 281.00] A couple quick announcements.
[281.00 → 288.00] So next Sunday is the spring semester of our adult education cross-training class.
[288.00 → 291.00] It will be a class on the early church.
[291.00 → 293.00] It's called After Acts.
[293.00 → 296.00] So after the book of Acts, what happened next?
[296.00 → 298.00] I know you want to know.
[298.00 → 302.00] Who are the disciples of the first apostles?
[302.00 → 305.00] How did the scriptures come to be formed?
[305.00 → 309.00] How did early Christians understand scripture and live it out?
[309.00 → 311.00] And how did Christianity spread around the Roman Empire?
[311.00 → 314.00] These are some of the things we'll explore together.
[314.00 → 321.00] And then there's another announcement, and I'll invite Elaine to come up and share with us.
[321.00 → 334.00] Good morning.
[334.00 → 338.00] You may have noticed the bulletin announcement or the Safe Church poster on council and staff and leadership training this coming Friday, April 10, presented by the CRC's very knowledgeable Safe Church Abuse
[338.00 → 355.00] Abuse Prevention and Response Coordinator, Fay Martin.
[355.00 → 373.00] I encourage all leaders, staff, and volunteers to attend this informative meeting, this training session on the church and councils roles and responsibilities in responding to allegations of abuse and leadership misconduct in the church.
[373.00 → 386.00] Although this particular training session is directed to church councils, staff, and ministry leaders, it is also open to anyone who would like to attend.
[386.00 → 396.00] Even though you may not be on council or are not a ministry leader right now, your very well could be in the future.
[396.00 → 403.00] Training for safe church responsibilities and responses is something from which we can all benefit.
[403.00 → 409.00] I hope to see many church leaders and future leaders at this meeting, and there will be coffee and cookies.
[409.00 → 410.00] Thank you.
[410.00 → 428.00] One more announcement is that, as probably many of you will know already, Henry Vuchteveen has passed away last Friday,
[428.00 → 436.00] Good Friday, and his memorial service will be held here this week on Thursday at 1 p.m.
[436.00 → 441.00] And later on, of course, we'll pray for the family.
[441.00 → 446.00] So, friends, we are in the season of Easter.
[446.00 → 451.00] Easter is not just one Sunday, but it is a whole season.
[451.00 → 454.00] And we are the people of the risen King.
[454.00 → 457.00] We are the people of the resurrected Saviour.
[457.00 → 463.00] He is the one who, in his death and resurrection, has overcome our sin and misery.
[463.00 → 468.00] He has destroyed the last enemy, which is death itself.
[468.00 → 475.00] And this Jesus, who is risen and ascended into heaven, is now building his church all around the world.
[475.00 → 481.00] And he is calling people from every nation to come and to know him and to worship him.
[481.00 → 484.00] And he is the one we worship this morning.
[484.00 → 488.00] And so, please join me in the call to worship.
[488.00 → 492.00] And let's read it responsibly together.
[492.00 → 495.00] Remember these things, Jacob.
[495.00 → 498.00] For you, Israel, are my servant.
[498.00 → 500.00] I have made you.
[500.00 → 502.00] You are my servant, Israel.
[502.00 → 504.00] I will not forget you.
[504.00 → 505.00] Together.
[505.00 → 506.00] Oh, no, sorry.
[506.00 → 507.00] Not yet.
[507.00 → 510.00] I have swept away your offences like a cloud.
[510.00 → 513.00] Your sins like the morning mist.
[513.00 → 514.00] Return to me.
[514.00 → 516.00] For I have redeemed you.
[516.00 → 517.00] Now together.
[517.00 → 520.00] Sing for joy, you heavens.
[520.00 → 522.00] For the Lord has done this.
[522.00 → 526.00] Shout aloud, you earth beneath.
[526.00 → 528.00] Burst into song, you mountains.
[528.00 → 531.00] You forest and all your trees.
[531.00 → 534.00] For the Lord has redeemed Jacob.
[534.00 → 538.00] He displays his glory in Israel.
[538.00 → 541.00] Please join me in a prayer of adoration and praise.
[541.00 → 543.00] Let's pray.
[543.00 → 555.00] Heavenly Father, you reveal your power, your beauty, your abundant kindness to us day after day in all that you have made.
[555.00 → 565.00] And we know that this is true in all times and all seasons, but we see it so clearly now as the world comes to life again in spring.
[565.00 → 572.00] We see your beauty and goodness in the lofty mountains to the north of us.
[572.00 → 578.00] We also see it, Lord, in the delicate budding flowers and trees.
[578.00 → 590.00] And Lord, even at night as we look into the sky, you have not hidden your glory, but it is revealed in the stars and in the moon that you have set in their place.
[590.00 → 593.00] Lord, how great you are.
[593.00 → 608.00] And Lord, you have shown us the depth of your love through giving your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who willingly came and bled and died to take away our sin.
[608.00 → 614.00] We praise you again this morning, oh Father, for raising Jesus from the dead.
[614.00 → 620.00] Help us, Lord, in this time of worship to find our life in Jesus.
[620.00 → 630.00] Help us to put the full weight of all of our hope and our trust and our faith and our longings and our needs in the risen Jesus.
[630.00 → 637.00] We pray all of this through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
[637.00 → 638.00] Amen.
[638.00 → 643.00] Please rise and hear God's greeting to us this morning.
[643.00 → 652.00] Jesus said, I have told you these things so that in me, you may have peace.
[652.00 → 656.00] In this world you will have trouble, but take heart.
[656.00 → 659.00] I have overcome the world.
[659.00 → 668.00] And I want to invite you into this greeting this morning in the passing of the peace.
[668.00 → 670.00] The peace of the Lord be with you.
[670.00 → 672.00] And also with you.
[672.00 → 673.00] Thank you.
[673.00 → 680.00] Please turn and greet one another with these words, with the peace of the Lord.
[703.00 → 705.00] Many times in the heartbeat.
[705.00 → 711.00] photons that are, but they can ricinerreat if we are CMB observations.
[711.00 → 725.10] At this moment they are not the place of, we see how LG w
[725.10 → 739.32] Alleluia, Alleluia,
[739.32 → 746.42] Hearts to heaven and voices raise.
[746.84 → 753.50] Sing to God, O hymn of gladness,
[753.50 → 760.70] Sing to God, O hymn of praise.
[761.10 → 767.46] He who honour, cross the victory,
[768.26 → 774.72] For the world's salvation led.
[775.32 → 781.96] Jesus Christ, the King of glory,
[781.96 → 789.16] Now in His greatest hand from the dead.
[793.16 → 798.46] Alleluia, Christ is risen,
[799.06 → 804.96] Death of the past has left in me.
[804.96 → 811.96] See the ancient hearts of evil,
[811.96 → 819.16] In confusion, memories dream.
[819.16 → 826.16] Once He died and once was buried,
[826.16 → 833.16] Now He lives forevermore.
[833.16 → 841.24] Jesus Christ, the world's Redeemer,
[841.56 → 848.16] Whom we worship and adore.
[848.16 → 857.16] Alleluia, Alleluia,
[857.16 → 863.16] Glory to God on high.
[863.16 → 870.16] Alleluia, to the Saviour,
[870.16 → 876.16] Who has won the victory.
[876.16 → 885.16] Alleluia, to the Spirit,
[885.16 → 892.16] Fount of love and sanctity.
[892.16 → 900.16] Alleluia, Alleluia,
[900.16 → 906.36] To the triumph majesty.
[906.36 → 929.56] Salvation belongs to our God,
[929.56 → 936.56] Who sits upon the throne,
[936.56 → 940.56] And to the Lamb,
[940.56 → 941.56] To the Lord's Son.
[941.56 → 944.56] Praise and glory,
[944.56 → 947.56] Wisdom and thanks,
[947.56 → 951.56] Honour and power and sway.
[951.56 → 958.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[958.56 → 964.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[964.56 → 970.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[970.56 → 972.56] Amen.
[972.56 → 982.56] We the redeemed shall be strong,
[982.56 → 987.56] In purpose and unity,
[987.56 → 992.56] Declaring our love,
[992.56 → 995.56] Praise and glory,
[995.56 → 998.56] Wisdom and thanks,
[998.56 → 1001.56] O Lord's Son,
[1001.56 → 1006.56] For the Lord's Son in the name of God.
[1006.56 → 1008.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[1008.56 → 1012.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[1012.56 → 1014.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[1014.56 → 1020.56] Be to our God forever and ever.
[1020.56 → 1022.56] Amen.
[1022.56 → 1025.56] Oh, forever and ever.
[1025.56 → 1041.38] forever and ever be to go, forever and ever be to go, forever and ever. Amen.
[1055.56 → 1074.38] We will fear the battle, we will fear the night, we will walk the valley with you by our side.
[1074.38 → 1085.26] You will go before us, you will lead the way, we have found a refuge, only you can save.
[1085.56 → 1096.74] Sing with joy now, our God is for us, if Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[1096.74 → 1107.74] Raise your voice now, no love is greater, who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1115.56 → 1126.56] Even when I stumble, even when I fall, even when I turn, I'll still your love is sure.
[1126.56 → 1137.56] You will not abandon, you will not forsake, you will cheer me over with never-ending grace.
[1137.56 → 1148.84] Sing with joy now, our God is for us, the Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[1148.84 → 1159.56] Raise your voice now, no love is greater, who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1159.56 → 1178.84] Let the heart no death can separate us, hell and death will not defeat us.
[1178.84 → 1203.44] He who gave his Son to free us, he who gave his Son to free us, he who gave his Son to free us,
[1203.44 → 1210.44] hold me in his love.
[1210.44 → 1220.44] Sing with joy now, our God is for us, if Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[1220.44 → 1231.44] Raise your voice now, no love is greater, who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1231.44 → 1237.44] Sing with joy now, our God is for us, if our God is for us, if our God is for us, if our God is for us,
[1237.44 → 1241.44] we can stand against us if our God is for us, if our God is for us, if our God is for us, if our God is for us,
[1241.44 → 1260.80] our scripture reading, our first scripture reading this morning is from Genesis, chapter 45, verses 1 to 14.
[1260.80 → 1268.24] If you'd like to follow along in your pew Bible, that is on page 36, but we will also have it on the screen.
[1270.24 → 1277.62] Genesis 45, verses 1 to 14.
[1277.62 → 1287.54] Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out,
[1288.06 → 1289.88] Have everyone leave my presence.
[1290.88 → 1295.70] So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers,
[1296.42 → 1302.80] and he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and Pharaoh's household heard about it.
[1302.80 → 1306.90] Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph.
[1307.50 → 1308.86] Is my father still living?
[1309.96 → 1315.26] But his brothers were not able to answer him because they were terrified at his presence.
[1316.20 → 1319.46] Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come close to me.
[1320.26 → 1327.18] When they had done so, he said, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt.
[1327.18 → 1332.86] And now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here,
[1333.50 → 1337.90] because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
[1338.60 → 1342.08] For two years now, there has been famine in the land,
[1342.64 → 1346.96] and for the next five years, there will not be plowing and reaping.
[1347.70 → 1352.06] But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth
[1352.06 → 1355.34] and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
[1356.46 → 1360.98] So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
[1361.54 → 1368.20] He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
[1368.90 → 1371.54] Now hurry back to my father and say to him,
[1372.06 → 1373.78] This is what your son Joseph says.
[1374.34 → 1376.54] God has made me lord of all Egypt.
[1377.04 → 1378.04] Come down to me.
[1378.14 → 1378.68] Don't delay.
[1378.68 → 1383.00] You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me,
[1383.50 → 1389.98] you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.
[1390.48 → 1394.86] I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come.
[1395.58 → 1401.26] Otherwise, you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.
[1401.26 → 1406.28] You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin,
[1406.80 → 1410.16] that it is really I who am I speaking to you.
[1410.90 → 1414.40] Tell my father about all the honour accorded me in Egypt,
[1414.80 → 1416.62] and about everything you have seen,
[1417.14 → 1419.06] and bring my father down here quickly.
[1420.48 → 1424.10] Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept,
[1424.86 → 1427.24] and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
[1427.24 → 1429.60] This is the word of the Lord.
[1434.38 → 1439.14] So we come now to our time of confession.
[1440.72 → 1446.46] You know, and so often we tend to think that the biggest problems we have in life
[1446.46 → 1450.30] are those things that are from without.
[1450.98 → 1455.16] You know whether it's the personal insult of someone cutting us off in traffic,
[1455.16 → 1456.92] that always bothers me,
[1457.28 → 1461.56] or the big problems, you know, of the refugee crisis,
[1461.68 → 1463.34] or wars in different countries.
[1463.58 → 1466.86] We always tend to think the problems in the world are out there.
[1468.38 → 1470.78] And, you know, for God's people in the time of Jesus,
[1471.06 → 1475.88] they thought their biggest problem was the political oppression of the Romans.
[1475.88 → 1482.96] But that is actually not what Jesus tells us is our biggest problem.
[1484.02 → 1489.18] Our biggest problem facing humanity is not the oppression from without,
[1489.38 → 1491.12] but it is the oppression from within.
[1491.92 → 1494.52] Hearts that have been twisted by sin,
[1495.14 → 1497.40] and that don't trust God.
[1497.40 → 1501.34] And that is why God sent his son Jesus.
[1502.04 → 1508.12] It's why Jesus willingly suffered and died and rose from the dead to free us,
[1508.92 → 1511.52] not so much from the oppression out there,
[1511.60 → 1516.94] but from the oppression of our sin and the wrath of God against sin.
[1517.30 → 1520.16] To free us, to give us a new life,
[1520.24 → 1522.74] to give us new hearts and a new spirit within us.
[1522.74 → 1527.34] And so let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.
[1527.76 → 1529.90] Please join me as I lead us in prayer.
[1532.04 → 1533.80] Almighty and merciful Father,
[1534.40 → 1537.68] we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
[1538.32 → 1542.54] We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
[1543.22 → 1545.66] We have offended against your holy laws.
[1546.34 → 1549.58] We have left undone those things which we ought to have done.
[1549.58 → 1553.28] And we have done those things which we ought not to have done.
[1553.98 → 1556.88] And apart from your grace, there is no health in us.
[1557.80 → 1559.64] O Lord, have mercy upon us.
[1560.42 → 1562.48] Spare all those who confess their faults.
[1563.26 → 1566.54] Restore all those who are penitent according to your promises
[1566.54 → 1570.18] declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1570.80 → 1574.38] And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,
[1574.38 → 1579.12] that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life
[1579.12 → 1582.90] to the glory of your holy name.
[1583.70 → 1584.16] Amen.
[1586.10 → 1589.16] Brothers and sisters, please rise in spirit or in body
[1589.16 → 1592.10] as you are able to hear God's words of forgiveness.
[1594.44 → 1597.08] God assures us of his pardon with these words.
[1597.28 → 1600.46] Blessed are the people, O Lord, who rejoice in you,
[1600.96 → 1603.44] who walk in the light of your presence.
[1603.44 → 1606.36] They rejoice in your name all day long
[1606.36 → 1609.52] and in your righteousness are exalted.
[1610.26 → 1611.34] Thanks be to God.
[1611.92 → 1613.54] Let's sing our next song.
[1614.32 → 1615.36] Which one is it?
[1616.22 → 1617.24] His Mercy is More.
[1617.24 → 1644.00] One love to remember, no wrongs we have done.
[1644.00 → 1649.12] Only is to go, no way, he counts no fair song.
[1649.48 → 1654.32] Throw him to a sea with a bottle for sure.
[1655.38 → 1660.40] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1660.40 → 1661.40] His mercy is more.
[1661.40 → 1674.36] The patience would wake us, we constantly roam.
[1674.36 → 1676.36] One Father, no way, he counts no fair song.
[1676.36 → 1679.32] One Father, so tender, is calling us more.
[1679.32 → 1684.70] He welcomes their weakness, the violence, the poor.
[1685.70 → 1690.58] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1691.28 → 1693.48] Praise the Lord.
[1695.26 → 1698.16] His mercy is more.
[1698.16 → 1705.16] Stronger than darkness, new where and more.
[1705.16 → 1710.16] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1710.16 → 1711.16] Praise the Lord.
[1711.16 → 1718.78] One riches of kindness, he lavished on us.
[1718.78 → 1723.68] His blood was a payment, his life was a cross.
[1723.68 → 1728.16] We stood with him, and we do never afford.
[1730.16 → 1734.16] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1734.16 → 1735.16] His mercy is more.
[1735.16 → 1736.16] Praise the Lord.
[1736.16 → 1737.16] Praise the Lord.
[1737.16 → 1738.16] Praise the Lord.
[1738.16 → 1741.16] His mercy is more.
[1741.16 → 1742.16] His mercy is more.
[1742.16 → 1747.16] Stronger than darkness, new where and more.
[1747.16 → 1752.16] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1752.16 → 1754.16] His mercy is more.
[1754.16 → 1757.16] His mercy is more.
[1757.16 → 1764.16] His mercy is more.
[1764.16 → 1770.16] Stronger than darkness, new where and more.
[1770.16 → 1774.16] Our sins, they are many, his mercy is more.
[1774.16 → 1789.16] The children are now welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School.
[1804.16 → 1805.16] Albeit yesterday.
[1805.16 → 1813.96] Frank LOL
[1813.96 → 1819.16] Suddenly words are preserved.
[1819.16 → 1821.16] Of our walk, dance, art.
[1821.16 → 1822.16] In this world, areas as good as songs praise us.
[1822.16 → 1826.16] We help with wells of heart.
[1826.16 → 1833.16] tin ham sanctify a clunky showing.
[1833.16 → 1841.20] Words of life, words of hope, Give us strength, help us go.
[1841.20 → 1850.26] In this world where'er we're known, Patient words will guide us home.
[1850.76 → 1858.68] Patient words, never true, Changing me and changing you.
[1858.68 → 1868.12] We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[1870.12 → 1878.76] Only words of our faith, Handed down to this age,
[1878.76 → 1887.70] Came to us to sacrifice, O hear the faithful words of Christ.
[1888.68 → 1898.12] Only words of preserve, For our walk in this world.
[1898.12 → 1906.12] They resound with God's willpower, O let the ancient words impart.
[1906.12 → 1915.56] Ancient words, never true, Changing me and changing you.
[1915.56 → 1923.56] We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[1923.56 → 1933.00] Ancient words, never true, Changing me and changing you.
[1933.00 → 1941.00] We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[1941.00 → 1950.44] We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[1950.44 → 1959.88] Ancient words, never true, Changing me and changing you.
[1959.88 → 1969.32] Good morning again, everyone.
[1969.32 → 1971.32] Good to be with you this morning.
[1971.32 → 1972.76] Good morning.
[1972.76 → 1973.76] Good morning.
[1973.76 → 1976.52] Before I forget, I've been meaning to mention that we have, you know, it's the season of
[1976.52 → 1979.16] Easter, we have these artworks around the wall.
[1979.16 → 1984.76] And so during Holy Week, we had some scenes of the cross up there.
[1984.76 → 1987.64] And now we have some scenes of the resurrection.
[1988.20 → 1994.36] So maybe I want to encourage you to take some time at some point to, they'll be up there for
[1994.36 → 2001.56] the next couple of weeks, but go ahead and take a chance to look at these artworks done by people in our own congregation.
[2003.08 → 2007.64] And so, as I mentioned, this is the second week in the season of Easter.
[2007.64 → 2019.48] And it's the season when the church around the world celebrates the very centre of our hope that Christ the Lord is risen.
[2019.72 → 2020.20] Hallelujah.
[2022.20 → 2022.68] Hallelujah.
[2024.12 → 2031.32] And so to help us grow in this hope, we're in a sermon series called Resurrection Presence.
[2031.88 → 2033.32] It's about eight weeks long.
[2033.32 → 2043.96] And what we're doing in this series is we're looking at those brief days and weeks between Jesus's resurrection from the dead and his ascension into heaven,
[2044.84 → 2052.44] when he is still in the world embodied in his resurrection life with his disciples.
[2052.44 → 2066.66] And we're considering what it means for the risen and living Jesus to be with each one of us right now in the particularities of our everyday lives.
[2067.56 → 2070.00] And so let's read our passage this morning.
[2070.38 → 2073.14] It is Luke chapter 24.
[2077.42 → 2081.22] Luke 24, verses 13 to 35.
[2082.44 → 2095.78] Luke 24, verses 13 to 35, on page 787 of your Pew Bible.
[2098.00 → 2103.16] And so at the beginning of chapter 24, we have Luke's resurrection account.
[2103.92 → 2106.58] And then now this is the passage immediately following.
[2107.36 → 2109.12] So let me read it for us.
[2109.12 → 2111.24] Please hear the word of the risen Lord.
[2112.44 → 2122.24] Now that same day, right, Easter morning, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
[2123.10 → 2126.84] They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
[2127.58 → 2134.50] As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them.
[2135.02 → 2137.68] But they were kept from recognizing him.
[2137.68 → 2142.72] He asked them, what are you discussing together as you walk along?
[2143.82 → 2147.44] They stood still, their faces downcast.
[2148.24 → 2158.22] One of them named Cleo pas asked him, are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?
[2158.22 → 2160.92] What things, what things, he asked?
[2161.60 → 2164.40] About Jesus of Nazareth, they replied.
[2165.04 → 2169.84] He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed, before God and all the people.
[2170.38 → 2176.44] The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him.
[2176.98 → 2181.24] But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.
[2181.24 → 2185.50] And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
[2186.52 → 2189.56] In addition, some of our women amazed us.
[2190.06 → 2193.88] They went to the tomb early this morning, but didn't find his body.
[2194.60 → 2199.94] They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.
[2200.74 → 2205.54] Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said.
[2206.22 → 2207.84] But him they did not see.
[2207.84 → 2217.14] He said to them, how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
[2217.86 → 2221.98] Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?
[2223.32 → 2231.44] And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.
[2231.44 → 2237.90] As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.
[2238.50 → 2242.88] But they urged him strongly, stay with us, for it is nearly evening, the day is almost over.
[2243.48 → 2245.20] So he went in to stay with them.
[2246.04 → 2251.84] When he was at the table with them, he took bread and gave thanks, broke it, and began to give it to them.
[2252.50 → 2255.44] Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.
[2255.82 → 2257.70] And he disappeared from their sight.
[2257.70 → 2265.52] They asked each other, were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us.
[2266.46 → 2269.00] They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem.
[2269.68 → 2278.98] There they found the eleven and those with them assembled together and saying, it is true, the Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.
[2278.98 → 2287.22] Then the two told what had happened on the way and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
[2287.98 → 2289.28] This is the word of the Lord.
[2291.96 → 2293.16] Please join me in prayer.
[2293.52 → 2294.12] Let's pray together.
[2295.70 → 2304.98] Heavenly Father, we thank you again this morning for these ancient words that are ever true and that you give to us because you love us.
[2304.98 → 2313.74] And Father, just as you revealed yourself to these two disciples on the road to Emmaus, we ask that you would do the same for us.
[2314.54 → 2322.58] Father, we long for our hearts to burn within us after you and about your truth.
[2323.48 → 2328.72] And so, Lord, we ask that by your spirit that you would guide us this morning as we open your word.
[2328.78 → 2332.06] And we ask that, Jesus, you would explain your word to us.
[2332.06 → 2335.20] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2335.78 → 2336.08] Amen.
[2338.38 → 2354.36] You know, one of the reasons I love the fact that we are going to spend the next several weeks in this season of Easter is because it gives us an opportunity to consider what Jesus' resurrection means,
[2354.52 → 2360.08] not just for Easter Day, but for our everyday lives.
[2360.08 → 2372.66] You know, because Easter Sunday, you know, for all of its beauty and its glory, we anticipate it, we decorate, we celebrate, the day has come, but then it's over.
[2373.30 → 2379.52] And we return to just kind of the realities of our day-to-day lives in the world.
[2379.52 → 2392.10] And in many ways, I think we are actually now more primed to hear the beauty of the Easter story, that Jesus is alive and that he is present with us.
[2392.10 → 2411.14] And we are ready now, as we live our ordinary lives, the ups and downs, the struggles, we're ready now to hear anew the story of the resurrected Lord and how he meets us in our everyday lives.
[2411.14 → 2417.74] And so this Easter story continues with this account that Luke records for us.
[2418.40 → 2420.76] Luke could have recorded all kinds of things.
[2420.82 → 2424.66] He says in the book of Acts that there are many things that Jesus said and did after his resurrection.
[2425.08 → 2426.50] But Luke chose this one.
[2428.04 → 2433.22] Two of Jesus' disciples are walking away from Jerusalem.
[2433.22 → 2435.04] It's Sunday.
[2435.04 → 2436.00] It's Easter morning.
[2436.74 → 2440.46] Jesus has risen from the dead, but they don't know it yet.
[2441.58 → 2445.76] In their minds, the Jesus movement is over.
[2446.62 → 2447.30] It is dead.
[2448.26 → 2455.98] So traumatic was Jesus' crucifixion that it all but extinguished the hope of those who saw it.
[2457.26 → 2459.48] They had followed this Jesus.
[2459.80 → 2461.44] They had believed in this Jesus.
[2461.44 → 2464.58] They had hoped in him and they had trusted in him.
[2464.88 → 2469.56] And now they are just devastated as we would be as well.
[2470.88 → 2475.56] And that is exactly when Jesus draws near to them.
[2476.54 → 2486.32] And what's really delightful about this passage is you see this transformation that happens as these two disciples have this interaction with the risen Lord.
[2486.32 → 2502.92] And so this morning I just want to follow the three movements that we see in this passage to see what happens when the risen Jesus walks alongside of these disciples, engages with them with his resurrection life.
[2503.76 → 2506.00] And to talk about what that could look like for us as well.
[2506.00 → 2514.50] So the first thing we see him do is that Jesus draws near in their confusion.
[2514.82 → 2516.10] That's the first movement we see.
[2516.20 → 2518.74] Jesus draws near in their confusion.
[2519.30 → 2522.34] So let's look again at verses 13 to 14.
[2522.34 → 2524.96] Again it says,
[2524.96 → 2544.78] So just a few days before, everything was so clear for these two disciples.
[2544.78 → 2549.00] They went with the crowds to Jerusalem.
[2549.94 → 2553.26] Jesus was the long-awaited king.
[2554.02 → 2556.70] Everybody was greeting him with songs.
[2557.70 → 2560.02] He told them that his time had come.
[2560.88 → 2566.26] They knew that meant that he was going to become king and take over Jerusalem.
[2566.50 → 2568.82] It was all so clear and deliberate.
[2570.66 → 2571.68] Then he went and died.
[2571.68 → 2576.94] I mean his hour had come, but then it just passed.
[2577.88 → 2582.86] And the songs of Hosanna turned into shouts of crucify him.
[2583.98 → 2594.08] And the kingdom that he was supposed to bring actually just kind of dissolved into this cynical sign hung on the cross that said king of the Jews.
[2594.08 → 2602.60] And with this, every single thing that they had known, that they were so clear about, was lost.
[2603.56 → 2611.20] All the clarity they had over those last few days, it all just dissolved into confusion, turmoil.
[2611.20 → 2615.16] And I love what happens next.
[2616.22 → 2617.70] Notice verse 15.
[2619.34 → 2627.68] As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them.
[2630.18 → 2634.40] Jesus himself drew near, as he does.
[2634.40 → 2640.18] Jesus loves to draw near to the brokenhearted.
[2641.18 → 2646.28] Now, as someone might say, well, maybe that is true for some people.
[2647.12 → 2651.58] Maybe Jesus draws near to some people, but it doesn't feel like that to me.
[2652.52 → 2657.52] To which the text is saying, actually, it didn't feel like that to them either.
[2658.78 → 2661.80] Notice verse 16, what it says next.
[2661.80 → 2665.54] Jesus drew near to them, but they were kept from recognizing him.
[2666.72 → 2670.34] Jesus is now walking right beside them.
[2670.46 → 2674.34] He is present, but they don't know it.
[2675.78 → 2677.74] They couldn't recognize him at all.
[2677.80 → 2679.66] They didn't have eyes to see him.
[2680.96 → 2684.38] And who of us doesn't resonate with that feeling sometimes?
[2684.38 → 2692.34] We want to believe, and maybe we did believe once, but all of the maybe the grief or the disappointment,
[2693.14 → 2696.74] the doubt of life has just risen like a cloud.
[2696.94 → 2698.84] It's obscured our sight.
[2699.08 → 2702.62] And we wonder, is Jesus really there?
[2702.62 → 2711.96] But even though, you know, they feel like Jesus is no longer with them, actually, they are not alone.
[2712.82 → 2716.92] Jesus himself draws near, and that is the point here.
[2718.26 → 2720.04] And then Jesus does something fascinating.
[2720.90 → 2726.26] He begins to engage them, and he asks them what they're talking about.
[2726.26 → 2731.36] Well, obviously, he knows, but he asks them about it, right?
[2731.42 → 2735.36] Like, just like a good counsellor, he asks just the right question.
[2736.16 → 2743.90] Simple question, but a well-placed question to draw out the sadness, the disappointment that they are feeling
[2743.90 → 2747.34] so that through this engagement, they can be healed.
[2747.34 → 2750.74] So he asks them this question in verse 17.
[2751.34 → 2755.74] He says, he asks them, what are you discussing together as you walk along?
[2757.80 → 2762.22] And then we get this vivid glimpse of just where these two disciples are emotionally,
[2762.72 → 2769.58] and we simply read, they stood still, their faces downcast.
[2770.96 → 2771.20] Right?
[2771.34 → 2774.18] To me, that is one of the saddest images in the whole Bible.
[2774.18 → 2778.72] They stood still, their faces downcast.
[2780.44 → 2781.34] Verse 18.
[2782.36 → 2787.86] One of them, named Cleo pas, asked him, are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know
[2787.86 → 2790.14] the things that have happened there in these days?
[2790.98 → 2791.98] How do you think he said that?
[2794.76 → 2796.84] It's kind of, is it a biting remark?
[2797.72 → 2799.22] Is it like, have you been living under a rock?
[2799.98 → 2802.76] I don't think Cleo pas wants to really talk about it.
[2804.18 → 2809.40] To which Jesus replies, what things?
[2810.10 → 2810.24] Right?
[2810.32 → 2811.26] Jesus presses in.
[2812.70 → 2818.94] And so they start to tell him the story of who Jesus was, who they hoped he would be.
[2820.36 → 2822.24] And then catch this in verse 21.
[2823.10 → 2831.56] The first part there where it says, but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.
[2831.56 → 2832.00] Right?
[2832.00 → 2832.56] Right?
[2833.56 → 2838.12] They're essentially telling God how God has let them down.
[2839.48 → 2841.58] He made all these great promises.
[2842.24 → 2844.10] He made all of these great claims.
[2844.22 → 2846.32] The kingdom of heaven is here.
[2848.00 → 2848.22] Right?
[2848.30 → 2850.48] The sight of the blind will be opened.
[2850.84 → 2851.70] Justice will come.
[2851.74 → 2852.60] All these things.
[2852.60 → 2857.46] They place their hopes in him only to be disappointed.
[2858.66 → 2859.96] But we had hoped.
[2861.28 → 2861.82] Right?
[2861.88 → 2867.36] That is the phrase of disappointment, of sadness, of confusion.
[2868.56 → 2871.44] And that is where Jesus shows up.
[2871.44 → 2874.58] And that is where he intends to meet us.
[2875.64 → 2878.30] In the but we had hoped.
[2878.60 → 2879.30] In that place.
[2880.68 → 2882.62] So here's the question for us this morning.
[2882.80 → 2884.30] What is that place for you?
[2885.24 → 2888.52] What is the place in your life, but we had hoped?
[2888.52 → 2889.80] What is that place for you?
[2889.80 → 2893.40] But we had hoped that following Jesus would mean financial security.
[2894.96 → 2898.96] But we had hoped it meant an easier marriage.
[2899.98 → 2902.04] But we had hoped it meant getting married.
[2903.12 → 2906.00] But we had hoped it meant obedient godly children.
[2907.06 → 2909.52] But we had hoped it meant having children.
[2910.74 → 2915.34] But we had hoped it meant relationships and friendships, less loneliness.
[2915.34 → 2919.20] But we had hoped it meant good health.
[2921.36 → 2927.48] But we had hoped it at least meant no devastating surprises that we never saw coming.
[2929.56 → 2934.52] But we had hoped it meant life would at least just look a little bit different from it does now.
[2935.90 → 2937.00] We had hoped.
[2938.78 → 2940.56] You know, and so what are those places for you?
[2941.38 → 2941.56] Right?
[2941.62 → 2942.96] Where you want to look at Jesus.
[2942.96 → 2946.10] And I don't know what kind of tone of voice.
[2946.66 → 2948.72] But say, are you the only one who doesn't know?
[2949.76 → 2949.90] Right?
[2949.90 → 2954.58] Are you the only one who hasn't heard how hopeless it is?
[2957.02 → 2959.58] Friends, that is the backdrop of Easter.
[2960.64 → 2960.82] Right?
[2960.86 → 2967.34] Where all of these hopes that have shaped their dreams for the future dissolve.
[2967.34 → 2971.22] Or at least they are disfigured beyond repair.
[2971.54 → 2977.60] And then where any mention of the possibility of resurrection just feels like a vague and powerless rumour.
[2979.60 → 2983.16] But that is where Jesus shows up.
[2983.80 → 2985.24] That is where he draws near.
[2985.30 → 2986.30] That's where he engages.
[2986.30 → 2992.26] And he brings his resurrection life to you in those places.
[2993.80 → 2996.24] And so that's the first movement we see in this passage.
[2996.64 → 2998.90] That Jesus draws near to them in their confusion.
[2999.84 → 3003.30] And in that place, not only does he meet them in that confusion,
[3003.86 → 3006.28] but then he leads them to deeper clarity.
[3007.26 → 3007.40] Right?
[3007.42 → 3009.40] And that's the second movement that we see here.
[3009.76 → 3011.94] Jesus leads them to deeper clarity.
[3011.94 → 3016.24] And I want you to see how he does this.
[3016.38 → 3017.70] And he does it in two ways.
[3018.32 → 3019.74] He does it in the scriptures.
[3020.32 → 3022.06] And he does it in the sacrament.
[3023.08 → 3027.10] And in the Reformed faith, we call these means of grace.
[3027.20 → 3027.98] Have you heard that before?
[3028.92 → 3029.84] Means of grace.
[3030.72 → 3031.72] What does that mean?
[3031.96 → 3033.34] What is a means of grace?
[3033.90 → 3035.84] Well, it's kind of like this, maybe.
[3036.60 → 3037.92] It's kind of like a carpenter.
[3037.92 → 3045.12] You know how a carpenter hammers nails into two-by-fours and things, right?
[3045.86 → 3047.26] Or, I don't know, these are nail guns now.
[3047.36 → 3048.26] But, you know, you get the idea.
[3048.40 → 3049.10] Hammer, nails.
[3049.80 → 3052.68] The carpenter hammers the nail into the wood,
[3052.88 → 3055.82] but he has a tool that he uses, right?
[3056.04 → 3059.10] He has a hammer that he pounds the nails in with.
[3059.84 → 3064.18] And you might say, well, is the hammer hammering the nails?
[3064.80 → 3066.76] Or is the carpenter hammering the nails?
[3066.76 → 3068.06] Who's doing it?
[3069.20 → 3071.54] Well, the hammer couldn't do it by itself, could it?
[3072.32 → 3072.54] Right?
[3072.60 → 3074.30] It needs the carpenter to do it.
[3074.74 → 3076.22] But the hammer is the tool.
[3076.84 → 3080.40] It's the means by which the nail is pounded in.
[3081.68 → 3085.68] And God is the one who works his grace into our hearts.
[3086.12 → 3087.66] He, I don't know if it's a great illustration,
[3087.82 → 3090.54] but he pounds in his grace into our hearts,
[3090.54 → 3093.20] but he uses certain tools to do it.
[3093.20 → 3095.86] And we call them means of grace.
[3096.76 → 3102.12] He uses them to shape us and form us and pound his grace into our lives.
[3103.20 → 3105.90] And so what are those tools that God uses?
[3107.14 → 3110.70] Well, we see in this passage, he uses the tools,
[3111.28 → 3113.28] these means of grace, of the scripture,
[3114.14 → 3115.92] opening the scriptures to them,
[3116.58 → 3117.84] and then also the breaking of bread.
[3117.84 → 3125.68] And it's through these two means of grace that their hearts become alive.
[3126.20 → 3129.46] And they see Jesus, and they start to put their faith in Jesus.
[3130.62 → 3132.18] Okay, so let's look at what Jesus does here.
[3132.44 → 3137.68] First, Jesus brings them into deeper clarity by explaining the scriptures.
[3137.68 → 3141.04] So notice in verses 25 to 27.
[3142.04 → 3143.26] He said to them,
[3144.12 → 3145.48] How foolish you are!
[3145.78 → 3149.00] How slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
[3149.80 → 3153.82] Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?
[3154.56 → 3158.04] And beginning with Moses and all the prophets,
[3158.22 → 3159.36] right, that's the whole Old Testament,
[3159.36 → 3166.14] He explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.
[3168.06 → 3170.08] And so the problem, what's the problem here?
[3170.14 → 3173.94] The problem with these two disciples is not that they don't read their Bibles.
[3174.58 → 3177.36] It's not that they haven't memorized enough scripture verses.
[3178.44 → 3182.68] Jesus is able to explain the scriptures to them
[3182.68 → 3184.54] and converse with them about the whole Bible
[3184.54 → 3187.14] precisely because they know their Bible.
[3188.62 → 3192.44] The problem is that they've read it selectively.
[3193.46 → 3193.68] Right?
[3193.76 → 3198.60] They expected God to send a Messiah, the Saviour, to redeem Israel.
[3199.28 → 3199.58] Good.
[3200.30 → 3201.32] They got that much right.
[3202.36 → 3208.34] But their expectation for the Saviour was a result of selective reading.
[3209.62 → 3210.86] Notice what Jesus says,
[3210.86 → 3214.06] How foolish you are and how slow to believe all.
[3214.54 → 3216.54] that the prophets have spoken.
[3217.68 → 3217.90] Right?
[3217.96 → 3221.56] They only listened to part of what the prophets said.
[3222.12 → 3224.48] Is God going to rescue and redeem Israel?
[3224.70 → 3225.00] Yes.
[3225.96 → 3227.28] But not in the way they thought.
[3228.14 → 3229.72] They thought the Saviour would come
[3229.72 → 3233.20] and would rescue them from the oppression of the Romans.
[3234.04 → 3235.94] And that he would come in power.
[3236.30 → 3238.16] And he would win a mighty battle.
[3238.50 → 3240.76] And they would all be in positions of prominence.
[3240.76 → 3242.06] And they would be free.
[3242.38 → 3243.28] And everything would be awesome.
[3243.28 → 3247.12] They didn't look at the verses that said something different.
[3247.88 → 3250.16] That he would do this through suffering.
[3251.26 → 3255.54] And that's why they were so confused when Jesus died.
[3255.54 → 3261.30] And this, friends, is the heart of foolish reading of the Bible.
[3262.00 → 3265.80] Is that we come to the Bible for it to say the things that we want it to say.
[3267.58 → 3269.96] But then Jesus gives them a new paradigm.
[3270.16 → 3272.40] A new way to read the Bible.
[3272.80 → 3274.88] Not with ourselves at the centre.
[3275.56 → 3277.24] But with Jesus at the centre.
[3277.24 → 3283.18] And here, Jesus invites us to read all Scripture.
[3283.70 → 3284.64] All history.
[3284.80 → 3285.80] All reality.
[3286.86 → 3289.04] With it always pointing to him.
[3289.60 → 3289.94] Right?
[3289.98 → 3291.94] With him at the centre of all things.
[3292.76 → 3295.60] And so we can imagine Jesus kind of walking along this road.
[3295.84 → 3299.60] Having the best Bible study that ever happened.
[3299.60 → 3305.40] Wouldn't you just want to have a recording of what Jesus said to these disciples?
[3306.60 → 3309.64] And you can just imagine him going through the whole Old Testament.
[3309.88 → 3311.48] And saying, you know, things like this.
[3311.52 → 3311.94] Hey, okay.
[3312.30 → 3313.18] Remember Genesis.
[3313.82 → 3314.70] Let's start at the beginning.
[3315.46 → 3317.82] Remember how God spoke, and he created the world.
[3318.34 → 3320.04] Well, I am the word of God.
[3320.04 → 3324.52] And remember how God made human beings in his image?
[3325.50 → 3327.24] Well, I'm not just made in the image of God.
[3327.32 → 3328.76] I am the image of God.
[3330.54 → 3330.68] Right?
[3330.72 → 3331.94] And then there's Adam.
[3332.22 → 3333.48] Who's put in the garden.
[3333.72 → 3336.02] Adam disobeys God by going to the tree.
[3336.56 → 3338.40] And death comes to all humanity.
[3339.38 → 3340.98] Well, I am the second Adam.
[3341.02 → 3343.36] And I obeyed God by going to the tree.
[3343.60 → 3344.16] The cross.
[3344.60 → 3347.16] And instead of death coming to all humanity.
[3347.62 → 3349.52] Salvation has come to all humanity.
[3351.04 → 3354.48] And then Jesus says, you know, I am the truer and the greater Noah.
[3355.00 → 3359.96] Whose righteousness provides a shelter from the storm of sin and God's wrath.
[3360.96 → 3362.86] I am the truer and greater Abraham.
[3363.28 → 3365.42] Who left the security of his home.
[3365.90 → 3369.10] In order to bring the blessings of God to all the nations.
[3370.56 → 3372.70] I am the truer and greater Isaac.
[3372.70 → 3378.46] Who willingly offered myself as the once for all sacrifice for all sin.
[3380.04 → 3382.04] I am the truer and greater Joseph.
[3382.04 → 3382.06] I am the truer and greater Joseph.
[3382.06 → 3385.32] Who was betrayed by his brothers and left for dead.
[3385.32 → 3389.98] And then rose up not just to become second in command to the Pharaoh.
[3390.48 → 3393.36] But to become the king of the entire world.
[3393.78 → 3397.70] To feed all the nations with the bread of my life.
[3397.70 → 3401.20] I am the truer and greater Moses.
[3401.20 → 3404.80] Whose Passover not only liberates his people from slavery.
[3405.26 → 3407.18] And the power of sin and death.
[3407.68 → 3413.28] But then leads them into the eternal freedom of the promised land of eternity.
[3413.28 → 3416.64] I am the truer and greater King David.
[3416.64 → 3421.36] Whose kingdoms increase in justice will know no end.
[3422.48 → 3424.40] I am the truer and greater Israel.
[3424.50 → 3430.52] The one in whom the whole story, the journey of the people of God, finds its ultimate meaning and purpose.
[3431.30 → 3436.60] The whole story of the Bible, over and over again, is about Jesus.
[3436.60 → 3443.62] As the children's Bible, the Jesus storybook Bible says, every story whispers his name.
[3445.52 → 3451.98] And when I say that, does your heart not burn within you?
[3454.18 → 3456.76] That's what these disciples said in verse 32.
[3456.76 → 3468.02] They asked each other, were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us?
[3469.90 → 3470.54] Why?
[3472.32 → 3474.24] Because Jesus is the key.
[3475.30 → 3481.12] He is not only the key to the Bible, but he is the key to our hearts.
[3481.72 → 3484.08] He is the key to ultimate reality.
[3484.08 → 3489.90] And then when you see that, that's when life begins to stir in you.
[3490.54 → 3490.66] Right?
[3490.72 → 3494.88] That's when we become alive, is when you see who Jesus is.
[3495.14 → 3496.40] You see what he has done.
[3497.82 → 3500.26] So that's the first means of grace that we see here.
[3500.36 → 3504.64] But also, Jesus leads us into deeper clarity through the sacraments.
[3505.34 → 3507.82] So then verse 30 and 31, they say this.
[3508.60 → 3512.34] When he was at the table with them, he took bread, he gave thanks, he broke it.
[3512.80 → 3513.96] He began to give it to them.
[3514.74 → 3518.36] Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.
[3518.94 → 3520.60] And he disappeared from their sight.
[3520.60 → 3527.56] So what happened here is that the disciples, they convinced Jesus to stay with them.
[3527.92 → 3528.06] Right?
[3528.14 → 3529.44] They're walking along the road.
[3529.58 → 3531.12] It's a long seven-mile walk.
[3531.22 → 3531.86] It's quite a while.
[3532.76 → 3533.80] It's getting late.
[3534.58 → 3536.42] It's dangerous on the road at night.
[3536.90 → 3538.74] They don't realize that you can't kill Jesus.
[3538.74 → 3541.84] So Jesus accepts their hospitality.
[3542.36 → 3544.08] He goes in, and he eats with them.
[3544.30 → 3545.82] And Jesus breaks the bread.
[3545.82 → 3554.28] And as he does so, the breaking of the bread, the self-giving, self-sacrificial love of Christ is revealed.
[3554.28 → 3557.64] And they see him for who he is.
[3557.64 → 3557.76] Right?
[3557.76 → 3563.74] You can kind of just imagine them breaking this bread and then seeing the scars on his hands as he does so.
[3563.92 → 3565.16] And looking more closely.
[3566.12 → 3567.44] And their eyes were opened.
[3568.04 → 3570.86] And they see him as he breaks the bread.
[3570.86 → 3580.32] Okay, so friends, Jesus leads us into deeper clarity about who he is as the redeemer through these means of grace.
[3580.32 → 3583.10] Through the scriptures, through the sacraments.
[3584.04 → 3588.06] And through these things, God hammers his grace into us.
[3588.26 → 3588.34] Right?
[3588.42 → 3590.16] He stirs up our hearts.
[3591.42 → 3593.42] And we see who he is more clearly.
[3593.42 → 3601.82] And then only when we begin to see Jesus more clearly do we get our courage back.
[3602.90 → 3605.74] And that is the third movement that we see here.
[3605.80 → 3609.22] That Jesus then instills them with resurrection courage.
[3609.80 → 3613.78] Because now they know Jesus is really alive.
[3613.84 → 3615.56] It's not just some vague rumour that they heard.
[3615.80 → 3617.10] They see it for themselves.
[3617.26 → 3618.06] He is risen.
[3618.06 → 3623.94] And now they know why.
[3624.26 → 3625.80] They know why he is risen.
[3626.38 → 3628.70] Not just to accomplish the redemption of Israel.
[3628.82 → 3632.12] Not just to free them from the oppression of the Romans.
[3632.90 → 3635.92] But he has accomplished the redemption of all humanity.
[3637.12 → 3638.74] From sin and from death.
[3639.10 → 3643.60] And then what is, when they see this, they see the gospel, what is the effect of that in their lives?
[3644.94 → 3645.38] Courage.
[3646.12 → 3647.98] So this is how the passage ends.
[3648.06 → 3649.34] It ends in this amazing way.
[3650.66 → 3652.58] So verses 33 to 35.
[3653.38 → 3658.58] They got up and returned out once to Jerusalem.
[3659.86 → 3664.08] There they found the eleven and those with them assembled together and saying,
[3664.08 → 3665.28] It is true.
[3665.78 → 3667.24] The Lord has risen.
[3667.68 → 3669.04] And he has appeared to Simon.
[3669.62 → 3672.44] Then the two told what had happened on the way.
[3672.56 → 3676.66] How Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
[3677.40 → 3677.60] Right?
[3677.60 → 3678.12] Isn't that cool?
[3678.12 → 3678.14] Isn't that cool?
[3679.14 → 3684.98] The story begins with these two disappointed, disheartened disciples getting out of town,
[3685.48 → 3687.16] walking away from all that happened.
[3687.80 → 3696.44] But it ends with two courageous evangelists heading back to the very city that had crucified their Lord.
[3696.44 → 3697.44] And telling everyone, it's true.
[3697.44 → 3699.70] And telling everyone, it's true.
[3699.70 → 3699.74] It's true.
[3700.08 → 3701.36] Jesus is risen.
[3701.36 → 3705.80] So let's summarize here.
[3705.80 → 3710.68] The risen Christ draws near to us in our confusion.
[3710.68 → 3718.72] And then he leads us into deeper clarity through these means of grace, through scripture and sacrament, through Bible and bread.
[3718.72 → 3728.10] And then with his grace at work in us.
[3728.10 → 3729.10] And then with his grace at work in us.
[3729.10 → 3735.48] He instills us with resurrection courage that we could then trust him and follow him.
[3735.48 → 3740.74] And now I want to close with a poem.
[3740.74 → 3748.78] It's a poem about the Emmaus Road by one of my favourite living poets and theologians, a man named Malcolm Gîte.
[3748.78 → 3752.92] So I'm going to read it for us, and then I'll pray for us.
[3754.68 → 3756.40] So here is the poem.
[3759.10 → 3762.16] We thought that everything was lost and gone.
[3763.50 → 3766.68] Disaster on disaster overtook us.
[3767.82 → 3771.08] The night we left our Jesus all alone.
[3771.64 → 3772.84] And we were scattered.
[3773.48 → 3775.78] And our faith forsook us.
[3775.78 → 3780.46] But oh, that foul Friday proved far worse.
[3781.26 → 3783.72] For we had hoped that he had been the one.
[3784.42 → 3787.16] Till crucifixion proved he was a curse.
[3787.88 → 3791.72] And on the cross our hopes were all undone.
[3793.12 → 3795.06] Oh foolish, foolish heart.
[3795.74 → 3796.90] Why do you grieve?
[3797.58 → 3800.10] Here is good news and comfort to your soul.
[3800.96 → 3803.20] Open your mind to scripture and believe.
[3803.20 → 3806.40] He bore the curse for you to make you whole.
[3807.18 → 3809.84] The living God was numbered with the dead.
[3810.42 → 3813.70] That he might bring you life in broken bread.
[3815.28 → 3816.06] Let's pray.
[3819.74 → 3825.98] Oh Lord, we long to be a people who have eyes to see you.
[3825.98 → 3836.06] To see you even when the clouds of confusion or despair or doubt or discouragement obscure our eyes from you.
[3836.08 → 3837.66] Lord, would you draw near to us?
[3838.36 → 3841.18] Would you reveal yourself that we would recognize you?
[3842.04 → 3843.18] Would we trust you?
[3844.62 → 3853.06] And Lord, would you through your grace shape us and comfort us and convict us and call us to continue down the path of following you?
[3853.06 → 3859.10] I pray, Lord, that you would make us open and sensitive to your spirit this day.
[3860.20 → 3861.80] We pray through Jesus Christ.
[3862.48 → 3862.74] Amen.
[3866.90 → 3872.16] So as our singers come up, let's all stand and we'll sing our song of response together.
[3872.16 → 3901.08] Come to us, the other stranger.
[3901.08 → 3904.76] When our dearest hopes are lost, speak to us, the other stranger.
[3904.76 → 3906.36] As you came that Easter day.
[3906.98 → 3911.64] Walk with us, do our lenience.
[3911.64 → 3916.10] Though we need you still today.
[3917.02 → 3921.22] Come to us when we are broken.
[3921.22 → 3926.44] When our dearest hopes are lost.
[3926.88 → 3931.06] Speak to us, the broken sense.
[3931.06 → 3937.06] You fulfilled upon the cross.
[3938.66 → 3943.46] Lay with us and give us blessing
[3943.46 → 3948.06] That our hopes again may rise.
[3949.06 → 3953.42] Offer us your broken body,
[3954.00 → 3958.56] Open our unseen eyes.
[3958.56 → 3963.46] Come to us, God's holy calling,
[3964.02 → 3968.64] Touch our hearts in burning flame.
[3969.12 → 3973.44] It's a Christ one, stand out living,
[3974.02 → 3978.70] Come to us through joy and pain.
[3980.56 → 3984.56] We'll never fail to see you
[3984.56 → 3989.56] As you walk with us each day.
[3990.56 → 3994.90] And so, friend and wise, stranger,
[3995.44 → 3999.56] You would join us on our way.
[4000.34 → 4004.70] And the most just love through your mercy,
[4004.70 → 4009.40] Beech and doubt and hear from sin.
[4010.24 → 4014.66] And to others be a blessing,
[4015.26 → 4019.24] Keep those faithful till I stay.
[4019.24 → 4032.76] We'll continue to worship the Lord
[4032.76 → 4035.38] with the giving of our tithes and offerings
[4035.38 → 4038.12] as a response to the risen Christ
[4038.12 → 4040.36] and all that he has done for us,
[4040.44 → 4042.78] all who he is for us.
[4043.22 → 4045.64] So may I invite those collecting the offering
[4045.64 → 4048.18] to come forward and do that now.
[4048.18 → 4050.18] Amen.
[4078.18 → 4080.18] Amen.
[4108.18 → 4110.18] Amen.
[4138.18 → 4140.18] Amen.
[4168.18 → 4170.18] Amen.
[4170.18 → 4172.18] Amen.
[4172.18 → 4174.18] Amen.
[4184.18 → 4188.18] So we will come and pray together.
[4188.18 → 4197.18] And it is because Jesus loves us that we can go to our Heavenly Father and pour out our hearts to him and bring our requests before him.
[4197.18 → 4200.18] He hears us, and he answers us.
[4200.18 → 4202.18] And so let's pray together.
[4206.18 → 4211.18] Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life.
[4211.18 → 4217.18] Whoever believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live.
[4217.18 → 4220.18] And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.
[4220.18 → 4228.18] Our Father, we thank you for this world transforming truth.
[4229.18 → 4234.18] Father, we thank you that we don't have to wonder if death is going to be the end.
[4234.18 → 4240.18] But we can know, and we can believe for certain that Jesus has conquered death.
[4240.18 → 4242.18] That he is alive.
[4242.18 → 4244.18] That he is present with us.
[4244.18 → 4257.18] And so we can have hope for ourselves, for our loved ones, for this world, that you will bring new creation and resurrection to all things.
[4257.18 → 4260.18] And Jesus said, let not your hearts be troubled.
[4260.18 → 4261.18] Believe in God.
[4261.18 → 4263.18] Believe also in me.
[4263.18 → 4267.18] So, Father, we confess that our hearts are troubled.
[4267.18 → 4274.18] In this world, there is so much warfare and conflict and injustice and greed.
[4274.18 → 4278.18] In this land, there is much heartache.
[4278.18 → 4280.18] And there is division.
[4280.18 → 4282.18] There is despair.
[4282.18 → 4286.18] And in our own hearts, there is so much sin.
[4286.18 → 4288.18] There is so much doubt.
[4288.18 → 4289.18] There is so much brokenness.
[4291.18 → 4294.18] So, Lord, we turn to you.
[4294.18 → 4299.18] We thank you that you are the kind of God that we can turn to.
[4299.18 → 4301.18] That you are powerful.
[4301.18 → 4302.18] That you sit on your throne.
[4302.18 → 4304.18] That you are good.
[4304.18 → 4311.18] That you are a good father who cares for us as your children and cares for the world that you have made.
[4312.18 → 4319.18] So, Father, we turn to you, and we pray again this morning for Henry, who is grieving the death of her husband, Henry.
[4319.18 → 4321.18] Lord, we pray for Henry.
[4321.18 → 4324.18] We pray for all of her family as well.
[4324.18 → 4329.18] Perhaps, Lord, also others we know who have lost someone recently.
[4329.18 → 4334.18] And we ask in your mercy, Lord, that you would reveal yourself.
[4335.18 → 4342.18] That through the obscurity of the clouds of grief, Lord, that you would make your presence known.
[4343.18 → 4346.18] Would you send your compassion and your peace.
[4346.18 → 4357.18] And, Lord, we also pray for BEV this morning, whose brother, Jerry, in the States, South Dakota, passed away, I think just yesterday.
[4358.18 → 4365.18] Lord, we pray for the Mantras and BEV especially, and all the family, Lord, who also grieve the passing of BEV's brother.
[4365.18 → 4369.18] We thank you, Lord, for bringing Henry home from the hospital.
[4370.18 → 4377.18] Would you pour out your healing touch upon her as she recovers from her hip replacement surgery.
[4377.18 → 4385.18] Lord, would you help her to sleep at night and help her be able to walk around and recover her movement.
[4385.18 → 4392.18] And then Jesus said, surely I am with you to the very end of the age.
[4393.18 → 4398.18] So, Father, we thank you that we can live every second of this life in the presence of Jesus.
[4398.18 → 4400.18] You are with us always to the end of the age.
[4401.18 → 4406.18] Father, help us then to follow you wherever you would lead us.
[4406.18 → 4409.18] You are God who is alive, and you are on the move.
[4409.18 → 4415.18] May we have the heart to follow you and move toward the needy.
[4415.18 → 4422.18] And move towards people who don't know you with words of life that point to Jesus.
[4422.18 → 4429.18] Lord, for those of us today who long for more of your presence in our lives, Lord, I ask for your mercy.
[4429.18 → 4438.18] Would you pour out your spirit that we might grow as a people who are ever more deeply connected to you by your grace at work within us.
[4438.18 → 4454.18] And lastly, Lord, we pray for those whom we carry in our hearts, or perhaps it's us here today, who have yet to taste and discover and to see the beauty and grace of Jesus Christ.
[4454.18 → 4463.18] Lord, we lift before you our longing that those we know, those we love, would discover the reality of the living Christ.
[4463.18 → 4470.18] And we ask all of this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4470.18 → 4471.18] Amen.
[4471.18 → 4478.18] All right, let's all stand, and we'll go out with God's blessing upon us.
[4478.18 → 4480.18] Thank you for joining us in this time of worship this morning.
[4480.18 → 4495.18] May the God of peace, who raised to life the great shepherd of the sheep, make us ready to do his will in every good thing, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory now and forever.
[4495.18 → 4496.18] Amen.
[4496.18 → 4504.18] So remain standing, we'll sing our final song, and then please join us through the fellowship hall for time of coffee.
[4504.18 → 4511.18] And also again, feel free to come back in and check out the resurrection artwork on the walls.
[4511.18 → 4526.18] We receive your blessing, we receive your grace, as we walk in light shining from your face.
[4526.18 → 4545.18] May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4545.18 → 4553.18] We receive your blessing as we live this place.
[4553.18 → 4560.18] May the peace that we live.
[4560.18 → 4571.18] We receive your grace, and we receive your grace.
[4571.18 → 4583.06] We receive your blessing, we receive your grace.
[4583.06 → 4588.52] As we walk in your light, shining through your peace.
[4588.88 → 4593.80] May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4593.80 → 4602.42] We receive your blessing as we live this place.
[4605.00 → 4609.96] Praise God, from whom all blessings come.
[4610.44 → 4614.78] Praise Him, O gracious dear people.
[4615.72 → 4621.16] Praise Him, above your heavenly host.
[4621.16 → 4625.92] Praise Father, Son, and praise Him, above your host.
[4625.92 → 4633.38] We receive your blessing as we live this place.
[4651.16 → 4655.34] Amen.
[4655.74 → 4656.82] Amen.
[4656.82 → 4657.16] Amen.
[4663.84 → 4664.76] Amen.
[4664.76 → 4694.74] Thank you.
