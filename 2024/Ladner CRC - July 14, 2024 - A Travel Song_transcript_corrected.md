[302.00 → 304.00] Amen.
[304.00 → 306.00] Well, good morning.
[306.00 → 307.00] Good morning.
[307.00 → 310.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[310.00 → 316.00] We gather here this Sunday, as we do every Sunday, as a response to God's calling to worship Him.
[316.00 → 322.00] For those of you who may be joining us here in Ladder for the first time, I'd like to extend a special warm welcome.
[322.00 → 324.00] We're very glad to have you here.
[324.00 → 334.00] My name is Ryan, and I, along with Marian and the rest of the music team, will be taking us through our liturgy and our communal worship of our Lord this morning.
[334.00 → 344.00] And this morning, Pastor Jason is away on holiday, and so we'll be hearing God's word from Pastor Jesse Pals, who joins us from the tapestry in Marple.
[344.00 → 350.00] Jesse will continue with Jason's summer journey through the Psalms with a sermon on Psalm 130.
[350.00 → 357.00] Now I'd ask you to please stand and join me in a responsive call to worship from our God, from whom all blessings follow.
[361.00 → 366.00] The earth is the Lord's and all that is in it, the world and all those who live in it.
[366.00 → 372.00] He has found it on the seas and established it on the rivers.
[372.00 → 377.00] And who shall ascend the hill of the Lord, and who shall stand in His holy place?
[377.00 → 387.00] Those with clean hands and pure hearts, who do not lift their souls to what is false, and do not swear deceitfully.
[387.00 → 389.00] Let us pray.
[389.00 → 394.00] Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with praise and reverence.
[394.00 → 398.00] With a word you set the stars in the heavens.
[398.00 → 403.00] Your work, the work of your hands is reflected throughout all the earth.
[403.00 → 407.00] All good things come from you, and apart from you there is nothing.
[407.00 → 412.00] We love you, Lord, and seek to magnify your holy name.
[412.00 → 413.00] Amen.
[413.00 → 417.00] Our Heavenly Father has called us to worship and now greets us.
[417.00 → 425.00] Grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and in love.
[425.00 → 434.00] As God has greeted us this morning, let's take an opportunity to greet our pew neighbours here with a handshake and a bit of fellowship.
[434.00 → 435.00] Thank you.

[479.00 → 498.42] The people of the risen King who denied bringing Him praise,
[498.42 → 506.24] Come, all, and tune your hearts to sing till the morning star of praise.
[506.24 → 514.42] From the shifting shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to Him,
[514.86 → 522.42] Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[523.70 → 530.70] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[530.70 → 538.88] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[538.88 → 552.26] Come those whose joy is morning sun, And those sleeping through the night.
[552.26 → 559.88] Come those whose peril battles won, And those struggling in the fight.
[559.88 → 568.06] For His perfect love will never change, And His mercies never cease.
[568.06 → 576.50] But follow us through all our days With a certain hope of peace.
[576.50 → 584.68] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[584.68 → 593.38] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[593.38 → 606.14] From young and old, From every man, Men and women of the faith,
[606.14 → 614.08] From those who full are empty And from the riches of His grace.
[614.08 → 622.26] Over all the world His people sing, Show to show we hear them all,
[622.26 → 629.76] The truth that cries through every inch, Our God is all in all.
[629.76 → 644.82] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice, One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[644.82 → 657.50] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice, One heart, one voice,
[657.50 → 662.50] O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[662.50 → 663.50] Rejoice, rejoice, Let Me, Father of America,
[663.50 → 678.32] ø
[678.32 → 686.30] Rejoice, chorus, let every tongue.
[686.30 → 695.30] I have a maker, he formed my heart.
[696.62 → 705.52] Before even time began, my life was in his hand.
[705.52 → 716.00] He knows my name, he knows my every thought.
[716.30 → 724.86] He sees each ear that calls, and hears me when I call.
[726.78 → 734.94] I have a father, he calls me his own.
[736.72 → 744.18] He will never leave me, no matter where I go.
[746.30 → 755.30] He knows my name, he knows my every thought.
[756.30 → 763.64] He sees each ear that calls, and hears me when I call.
[763.64 → 773.64] He knows my name, he knows my every thought.
[773.64 → 775.64] He hears me when I call.
[775.64 → 783.64] He sees each ear that calls, and hears me when I call.
[783.64 → 787.64] He hears me when I call.
[787.64 → 789.64] He hears me when I call.
[789.64 → 793.64] He hears me when I call.
[793.64 → 823.64] 
[823.64 → 825.64] He says,
[825.64 → 855.64] 
[855.64 → 867.64] I don't know the graph, it is sand streams, we promise.
[867.64 → 871.76] will save them from death and cover a multitude of sins.
[872.14 → 873.36] This is the word of the Lord.
[875.32 → 877.62] Let's sing our third song, Taste and See.
[877.62 → 900.34] I sought the Lord, and he answered me,
[900.34 → 906.94] and delivered me from every tear.
[907.62 → 913.02] Those who will come here are radiant,
[913.02 → 916.64] they'll never be ashamed,
[917.70 → 920.68] they'll never be ashamed.
[921.54 → 928.02] Disappoint and pride, and the Lord hurt me,
[928.40 → 933.76] and save me from my enemies.
[933.76 → 941.16] The Son of God surrounds his face,
[941.16 → 947.76] we will deliver them, we will deliver them.
[947.76 → 955.16] Magnify the Lord with me,
[955.16 → 962.56] come and salt his name together,
[962.56 → 968.56] glorify the Lord with me.
[968.56 → 975.96] Come and salt his name forever.
[975.96 → 981.96] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[981.96 → 989.36] Oh, blessed is he who hides in him.
[989.36 → 996.58] Oh, fear the Lord, oh, all you saints,
[996.98 → 999.36] they'll give you everything,
[999.36 → 1002.76] and give you everything.
[1002.76 → 1009.76] And if I'm alone with me,
[1009.76 → 1016.76] come and salt his name together,
[1016.76 → 1022.76] glorify the Lord with me.
[1022.76 → 1030.16] Come and salt his name forever.
[1030.16 → 1037.56] Let us bless the Lord,
[1037.56 → 1041.56] every day and night,
[1041.56 → 1044.56] never-ending praise,
[1044.56 → 1048.68] may our incense rise.
[1048.68 → 1051.56] Let us bless the Lord,
[1051.56 → 1055.56] every day and night,
[1055.56 → 1058.96] never-ending praise,
[1058.96 → 1062.96] may our incense rise.
[1062.96 → 1065.96] Let us bless the Lord,
[1065.96 → 1068.96] every day and night,
[1068.96 → 1071.96] never-ending praise,
[1071.96 → 1075.96] may our incense rise.
[1075.96 → 1083.36] God bless the Lord with me.
[1083.36 → 1089.36] Come and salt his name forever,
[1089.36 → 1096.36] glorify the Lord with me.
[1096.36 → 1103.36] Come and salt his name forever,
[1103.36 → 1106.76] glorify the Lord with me.
[1106.76 → 1109.76] God bless the Lord with me.
[1109.76 → 1116.76] Come and salt his name forever,
[1116.76 → 1122.76] glorify the Lord with me.
[1122.76 → 1131.76] Come and salt his name forever.
[1131.76 → 1135.16] Come and salt his name forever,
[1135.16 → 1137.16] and salt his name forever,
[1137.16 → 1139.16] and salt his name forever.
[1139.16 → 1141.16] And salt his name forever,
[1141.16 → 1143.16] and salt his name forever.
[1143.16 → 1144.16] And salt his name forever,
[1144.16 → 1145.16] and salt his name forever.
[1145.16 → 1147.16] Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.
[1147.16 → 1149.16] When he came near the house,
[1149.16 → 1151.16] he heard music and dancing.
[1151.16 → 1152.36] So he called one of his servants
[1152.36 → 1153.96] and asked him what was going on.
[1153.96 → 1155.96] Your brother has come, he replied,
[1155.96 → 1158.16] and your father has killed the fattened calf
[1158.16 → 1159.56] because he has him back,
[1159.56 → 1161.16] safe and sound.
[1161.16 → 1162.56] The older brother became angry
[1162.56 → 1164.56] and refused to go in.
[1164.56 → 1166.56] So his father went out and pleaded with him.
[1166.56 → 1168.56] But he answered his father,
[1168.56 → 1170.56] Look, all these years I've been slaving for you
[1170.56 → 1172.56] and never disobeyed your orders.
[1172.56 → 1174.56] You never even gave me so much as a young goat
[1174.56 → 1176.56] so I could celebrate with my friends.
[1176.56 → 1178.56] But when this son of yours,
[1178.56 → 1180.56] who has squandered your property with prostitutes,
[1180.56 → 1184.56] comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him.
[1184.56 → 1187.96] My son, the father said,
[1187.96 → 1189.96] You are always with me,
[1189.96 → 1191.96] and everything I have is yours.
[1191.96 → 1193.96] But we had to celebrate and be glad
[1193.96 → 1195.96] because your brother of yours,
[1195.96 → 1197.96] who was dead, is alive again.
[1197.96 → 1201.96] He was lost and is found.
[1201.96 → 1205.96] When we get to this part of the parable
[1205.96 → 1209.36] older brother, how many of us are ready to tune out?
[1209.36 → 1213.36] The conclusion can feel like a footnote in the story.
[1213.36 → 1215.36] Yes, the older brother is a bit angry,
[1215.36 → 1217.36] but he's got a point, doesn't he?
[1217.36 → 1220.36] Let's be honest, with a work ethic like he's got,
[1220.36 → 1224.36] he probably would do just fine without any inheritance at all.
[1224.36 → 1226.76] Unlike that younger brother of his,
[1226.76 → 1230.76] we think he would do just fine in the distant country,
[1230.76 → 1233.76] estranged from his father or not.
[1233.76 → 1236.76] And come on, what's wrong with a little self-reliance?
[1236.76 → 1239.76] Isn't that what parents are supposed to hope for?
[1239.76 → 1242.76] The parable ends without a definite conclusion.
[1242.76 → 1245.76] We don't know how the older brother responds.
[1245.76 → 1249.16] Does he pack up his things and head off for the distant country
[1249.16 → 1250.76] like his younger brother did before him?
[1250.76 → 1255.16] Does he regret his outburst and repent,
[1255.16 → 1257.76] making amends with the father and the brother?
[1257.76 → 1260.96] Or maybe in classic older brother fashion,
[1260.96 → 1262.16] he splits the difference.
[1262.16 → 1265.56] Maybe he skips the party and goes back to his work in the field,
[1265.56 → 1268.56] keeping the peace, but harbouring the grudge.
[1268.56 → 1273.36] Let's open our hearts to God and ask for some wisdom
[1273.36 → 1274.76] and confess our sins.
[1274.76 → 1280.56] Holy Father, we confess that the pride and arrogance
[1280.56 → 1283.96] we hold in our hearts keeps us from a better relationship
[1283.96 → 1287.96] with both you and with our brothers and sisters.
[1287.96 → 1291.96] We are blind to our own sin and yet so eagerly cast judgment
[1291.96 → 1293.76] on those around us.
[1293.76 → 1296.96] So easily we forget that all of our blessings come from you.
[1296.96 → 1299.96] Help us to work past our self-righteousness
[1299.96 → 1302.96] and instead come to know you more fully.
[1302.96 → 1306.96] Separated from your love, we cannot stand.
[1306.96 → 1310.36] Guide us, Lord, toward what is good
[1310.36 → 1313.36] and free us from our sinful ways.
[1313.36 → 1315.36] Amen.
[1315.36 → 1321.36] Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
[1321.36 → 1326.36] clothe yourself in compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness,
[1326.36 → 1328.36] and patience.
[1328.36 → 1331.36] Bear with each other and forgive one another.
[1331.36 → 1333.76] And if any of you has a grievance against someone,
[1333.76 → 1336.76] forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[1336.76 → 1339.76] And over all of these virtues, put on love,
[1339.76 → 1343.76] which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[1343.76 → 1347.76] Let us now sing of our dependence on our Lord.
[1347.76 → 1368.16] Lord, I come, I confess,
[1368.16 → 1373.56] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you,
[1373.56 → 1374.56] and now in the world I find my rest.
[1374.56 → 1380.56] And without you, I fall apart.
[1380.56 → 1387.06] You're the one that guides my heart.
[1387.06 → 1393.16] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[1393.16 → 1396.20] oh
[1422.04 → 1422.76] grace
[1423.16 → 1436.76] Where grace is found, Is where you are, And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[1436.76 → 1443.46] Holiness is Christ in me
[1443.46 → 1449.00] Where you are, Lord, I am free
[1449.00 → 1455.76] Holiness is Christ in me
[1455.76 → 1465.74] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1465.74 → 1471.94] Every hour I need you
[1471.94 → 1477.60] My one defence, my righteousness
[1477.60 → 1482.94] Oh God, how I need you
[1482.94 → 1488.74] So teach my soul to rise to you
[1488.74 → 1494.22] When temptation comes my way
[1494.22 → 1499.42] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1499.42 → 1505.22] Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1505.22 → 1510.42] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1510.42 → 1515.62] Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1515.62 → 1526.62] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1526.62 → 1531.62] Every hour I need you
[1531.62 → 1537.82] My one defence, my righteousness
[1537.82 → 1542.82] Oh God, how I need you
[1542.82 → 1550.82] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1550.82 → 1557.02] Every hour I need you
[1557.02 → 1563.02] My one defence, my righteousness
[1563.02 → 1568.02] Oh God, how I need you
[1568.02 → 1576.22] My one defence, my righteousness
[1576.22 → 1582.22] Oh God, how I need you
[1582.22 → 1594.12] At this point, the kids ages three through grade three can head off to their class
[1594.12 → 1596.32] I think Annika's asked three times since the start of the service
[1596.32 → 1599.32] So hopefully that's not an indication that I'm boring anybody
[1599.32 → 1600.32] But
[1600.32 → 1604.52] And as they're heading out, I would like to invite
[1604.52 → 1606.32] Let's get up Pastor Jesse Pals
[1606.32 → 1608.72] As I mentioned earlier, Jesse is a church planter
[1608.72 → 1612.72] And campus pastor of the tapestry in Marple, which is in Vancouver
[1612.72 → 1617.72] He holds a Masters of Divinity from Regents and is ordained as a pastor in the CRC
[1617.72 → 1621.52] Jesse is married to Rochelle, and together they enjoy a full life with their three boys
[1621.52 → 1623.72] Julian, August and Kyrie
[1623.72 → 1627.72] And eight years ago they actually moved to Ladder here from Vancouver
[1627.72 → 1629.12] And they haven't looked back
[1629.12 → 1633.32] They enjoy exploring BC together, camping, hiking and eating al fresco
[1633.32 → 1635.52] So, thank you, Jesse
[1635.52 → 1637.32] Thank you, Ryan, thank you
[1637.32 → 1639.32] Good morning church
[1639.32 → 1640.32] Good morning
[1640.32 → 1643.32] Ah, it's great to be here
[1643.32 → 1649.32] You know, it's, this church is, you are about a ten-minute walk away from where I live
[1649.32 → 1652.32] Ten, fifteen minutes, but I drove this morning
[1652.32 → 1654.32] I'll be honest
[1654.32 → 1659.52] Um, but you're right in my backyard, or I'm in your backyard
[1659.52 → 1662.52] Either way, it's great to be with you this morning
[1662.52 → 1666.52] I wanna really honour what you're doing throughout the summer
[1666.52 → 1673.52] You are plunging into the Psalter, into the book of Psalms
[1673.52 → 1676.52] And I think that is wonderful
[1676.52 → 1683.52] What a, what an amazing thing to do during the summer is to bathe yourself in the vocabulary of worship
[1683.52 → 1686.72] And so, this morning
[1686.72 → 1688.72] I wanna talk about travel
[1688.72 → 1691.72] I wanna talk about Psalm 130
[1691.72 → 1695.72] Psalm 130 is a travel song
[1695.72 → 1700.72] Um, I don't know about you if you've ventured out
[1700.72 → 1701.72] Throughout the summer already
[1701.72 → 1708.72] But I just returned from a family trip to one of our, our family's cabins in BC
[1708.72 → 1713.92] And so, I'm just back, and I know that your pastor, Pastor Jason, is probably somewhere else
[1713.92 → 1716.92] Travelling, camping, enjoying the summer in BC
[1716.92 → 1722.92] Um, who here has or will be travelling this summer?
[1722.92 → 1723.92] Hands raised
[1723.92 → 1727.92] Who's looking forward to, to not being here, you know
[1727.92 → 1731.12] Amazing
[1731.12 → 1733.12] Well that's, that's wonderful
[1733.12 → 1736.12] Uh, our family as I mentioned just returned
[1736.12 → 1737.12] I have three sons
[1737.12 → 1740.12] Uh, a ten-year-old, an eight-year-old, and a six-year-old
[1740.12 → 1743.12] Um, when we go on road trips, they insist
[1743.12 → 1745.32] This is a recent development
[1745.32 → 1747.32] They insist on having a playlist
[1747.32 → 1749.32] Music to listen to
[1749.32 → 1752.32] You know, something to just pass the time, I guess
[1752.32 → 1753.52] Something to sing along to
[1753.52 → 1759.32] Uh, we just returned to a, a family trip to Green Lake
[1759.32 → 1761.32] In, in the Caribou region of BC
[1761.32 → 1763.32] And it was sublime
[1763.32 → 1764.32] It was hot
[1764.32 → 1765.72] I know it was hot here
[1765.72 → 1766.72] It was hot there
[1766.72 → 1771.92] Um, we'll be heading to the Okanagan in a couple of weeks
[1771.92 → 1773.92] To spend time with family at another cabin
[1773.92 → 1780.32] And as I mentioned, they, my boys, they insist on having a soundtrack to the summer
[1780.32 → 1783.92] They insist upon having a playlist
[1783.92 → 1785.52] Something to listen to
[1785.52 → 1787.92] Something to mark their memories by
[1787.92 → 1790.92] Little known fact
[1790.92 → 1793.92] Psalm 130 is a travel song
[1793.92 → 1797.12] Psalm 130 is a song
[1797.12 → 1801.12] That ancient pilgrims, Israelites
[1801.12 → 1804.12] Would have sang to themselves and sang to the Lord
[1804.12 → 1807.12] As they journeyed towards the temple
[1807.12 → 1809.12] In their annual pilgrimage
[1809.12 → 1813.12] So, I want to read the psalm aloud
[1813.12 → 1816.12] And then I want to draw from it four directions
[1816.12 → 1820.12] If we are to travel along the way of Jesus
[1820.12 → 1824.92] How can we look at this psalm and take four cues
[1824.92 → 1826.12] Or four directions
[1826.12 → 1829.92] That would inform how we enter into God's presence
[1829.92 → 1833.32] That would teach us
[1833.32 → 1837.12] How to follow the faithful way of Jesus
[1837.12 → 1840.92] Would you be interested in doing that with me this morning?
[1840.92 → 1842.92] Amen
[1842.92 → 1845.32] Let's pray before we read God's word
[1845.32 → 1849.32] Heavenly Father, thank you so much for your word
[1849.32 → 1850.52] It is sweet
[1850.52 → 1853.52] It is restorative
[1853.52 → 1856.52] It is healing
[1856.52 → 1857.52] It is powerful
[1857.52 → 1860.12] Lord, when it goes out
[1860.12 → 1862.52] It accomplishes what you will
[1862.52 → 1867.52] And so, Lord, we ask that as I preach your word
[1867.52 → 1869.52] As I share your word this morning
[1869.52 → 1873.52] That you would tenderize hearts
[1873.52 → 1875.52] Make them soft now by your Holy Spirit
[1875.52 → 1878.72] That you would make hearts fertile
[1878.72 → 1883.32] And able to receive what you have for your people
[1883.32 → 1887.32] We pray this together in faith
[1887.32 → 1889.32] In the name of your son, Jesus Christ
[1889.32 → 1889.72] Amen
[1889.72 → 1893.72] Psalm 130
[1893.72 → 1894.72] It's a travel song
[1894.72 → 1897.72] A song of ascents
[1897.72 → 1900.92] Out of the depths
[1900.92 → 1902.92] I cry to you, Lord
[1902.92 → 1904.92] Lord, hear my voice
[1904.92 → 1908.92] Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy
[1908.92 → 1911.12] If you, Lord
[1911.12 → 1914.12] Kept a record of sins
[1914.12 → 1916.12] Lord, who could stand?
[1916.12 → 1919.12] But with you there is forgiveness
[1919.12 → 1924.12] So that we can, with reverence, serve you
[1924.12 → 1926.18] I wait for the Lord
[1926.18 → 1928.42] My whole being waits
[1928.42 → 1931.60] And in his word I put my hope
[1931.60 → 1936.88] I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning
[1936.88 → 1939.86] More than watchmen wait for the morning
[1939.86 → 1943.38] Israel, put your hope in the Lord
[1943.38 → 1946.44] For with the Lord is unfailing love
[1946.44 → 1949.04] And with him is full redemption
[1949.04 → 1953.76] He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins
[1953.76 → 1956.72] This is the word of the Lord
[1956.72 → 1964.44] Psalm 130 is a song, as I mentioned
[1964.44 → 1966.62] That ancient Israelite pilgrims would sing
[1966.62 → 1967.76] On their way up to Jerusalem
[1967.76 → 1972.06] And as they ascended the steps of Solomon's temple
[1972.06 → 1973.82] They would sing aloud
[1973.82 → 1976.30] These four couplets
[1976.30 → 1979.72] In Hebrew poetry they're called strophes
[1979.72 → 1984.40] Four different parts that comprise these eight verses
[1984.40 → 1988.66] This morning I want to explore four ideas
[1988.66 → 1989.64] Four learnings
[1989.64 → 1993.52] That would offer us a way
[1993.52 → 1997.72] Practical directions to live and flourish in God's presence
[1997.72 → 2002.44] The ancient travellers climbing the steps of Solomon's temple
[2002.44 → 2003.36] Would have been tired
[2003.36 → 2005.02] They would have been dirty
[2005.02 → 2006.20] They would have been wary
[2006.20 → 2009.76] They would have most likely
[2009.76 → 2012.24] If they're at all like us
[2012.24 → 2015.00] They would have regretted
[2015.00 → 2016.56] Carrying a bunch of things
[2016.56 → 2017.82] That they had no need of
[2017.82 → 2020.88] They would have felt the burden
[2020.88 → 2024.44] Of carrying things they wished
[2024.44 → 2025.88] They would have left back home
[2025.88 → 2029.66] But they are entering into the presence of God
[2029.66 → 2032.46] And the amount of comfort
[2032.46 → 2033.72] And the amount of strength
[2033.72 → 2036.08] That they would have experienced
[2036.08 → 2038.54] As they entered the temple grounds
[2038.54 → 2040.24] It would have made
[2040.24 → 2043.12] The arduous journey
[2043.12 → 2045.32] Totally worth it
[2045.32 → 2048.82] It would have made every step worth it
[2048.82 → 2053.50] Now I don't know where we're all coming from this morning
[2053.50 → 2057.40] I don't know what we're carrying in
[2057.40 → 2058.90] To the worship service
[2058.90 → 2061.34] But one thing I do know
[2061.34 → 2064.24] Is that God's word is a lamp unto our feet
[2064.24 → 2068.64] I want to show that there are four directions
[2068.64 → 2071.22] That every Christian needs to follow
[2071.22 → 2072.50] To enter God's presence
[2072.50 → 2076.06] We have to have four things
[2076.06 → 2077.18] Or four directions
[2077.18 → 2080.28] We have to have travelling mercies
[2080.28 → 2085.64] We have to make worship a way of life
[2085.64 → 2088.48] We have to go through hope
[2088.48 → 2090.50] And lastly
[2090.50 → 2093.18] We have to find the road to redemption
[2093.18 → 2096.34] It's like this
[2096.34 → 2100.36] If you were planning a journey
[2100.36 → 2101.70] To be with the Lord
[2101.70 → 2104.58] Which is really what life is all about
[2104.58 → 2106.10] Right?
[2106.14 → 2108.30] We have finite time
[2108.30 → 2109.90] We have a fixed amount of time
[2109.90 → 2111.86] To dwell
[2111.86 → 2112.82] To live
[2112.82 → 2115.32] To know the Lord here
[2115.32 → 2118.28] And we do this all
[2118.28 → 2119.30] Of course
[2119.30 → 2120.90] Before the infinite
[2120.90 → 2123.26] Face of God
[2123.26 → 2126.48] And as we journey
[2126.48 → 2127.82] As we live
[2127.82 → 2132.44] If we follow these directions
[2132.44 → 2135.14] We will arrive safely in his presence
[2135.14 → 2137.34] And the problem is
[2137.34 → 2139.20] That I think so many of us
[2139.20 → 2141.24] Want to find our own way to God
[2141.24 → 2143.20] So many of us
[2143.20 → 2145.02] Would rather make up
[2145.02 → 2146.70] The directions as we go
[2146.70 → 2150.00] But what results
[2150.00 → 2151.70] More times than not
[2151.70 → 2152.98] Is that we get lost
[2152.98 → 2156.78] When we start taking directions
[2156.78 → 2157.88] From our culture
[2157.88 → 2160.08] We become disoriented
[2160.08 → 2161.24] To our destination
[2161.24 → 2165.66] The ancient Israelite pilgrims
[2165.66 → 2167.18] Who annually made their way
[2167.18 → 2168.06] To God's temple
[2168.06 → 2170.12] To offer sacrifices
[2170.12 → 2171.10] To the Lord
[2171.10 → 2173.18] They had to climb the roads
[2173.18 → 2174.28] Leading to Jerusalem
[2174.28 → 2177.08] You may know that Jerusalem
[2177.08 → 2179.46] Is on a hill
[2179.46 → 2180.30] Right?
[2180.36 → 2181.06] Or a mount
[2181.06 → 2183.68] And God's people had to climb
[2183.68 → 2185.28] They had to climb a little
[2185.28 → 2187.28] To progress along their way
[2187.28 → 2188.78] Into God's presence
[2188.78 → 2190.02] As they pilgrimage
[2190.02 → 2191.98] As they made their journey
[2191.98 → 2193.20] To Jerusalem
[2193.20 → 2194.48] Some every year
[2194.48 → 2196.40] Now maybe
[2196.40 → 2198.64] You're doing some climbing
[2198.64 → 2199.30] Of your own
[2199.30 → 2202.68] Maybe it's the corporate ladder
[2202.68 → 2203.82] At work
[2203.82 → 2205.62] Maybe
[2205.62 → 2206.84] It's
[2206.84 → 2209.30] Climbing the walls at home
[2209.30 → 2210.34] Because
[2210.34 → 2210.98] Because
[2210.98 → 2212.64] Well you have children
[2212.64 → 2213.74] You have young children
[2213.74 → 2215.30] And maybe
[2215.30 → 2216.78] You feel like
[2216.78 → 2217.84] You're climbing the walls
[2217.84 → 2220.52] Whatever it is
[2220.52 → 2223.02] Wherever we're trying
[2223.02 → 2223.78] To get to
[2223.78 → 2224.72] While following
[2224.72 → 2225.62] The way of Jesus
[2225.62 → 2227.46] I've learned this much
[2227.46 → 2229.22] We will only arrive
[2229.22 → 2230.26] In one piece
[2230.26 → 2231.88] If we arrive
[2231.88 → 2232.76] With ourselves
[2232.76 → 2233.92] Intact
[2233.92 → 2235.82] Wholehearted
[2235.82 → 2236.78] And full of faith
[2236.78 → 2237.36] In the goodness
[2237.36 → 2238.40] Of our Lord
[2238.40 → 2240.84] So here
[2240.84 → 2241.96] Four directions
[2241.96 → 2242.72] I offer
[2242.72 → 2244.44] Four directions
[2244.44 → 2244.94] That
[2244.94 → 2246.78] That are given to us
[2246.78 → 2248.42] In Psalm 130
[2248.42 → 2250.82] Travelling mercies
[2250.82 → 2252.02] We find this
[2252.02 → 2253.10] In verses 1 and 2
[2253.10 → 2254.98] It's noteworthy
[2254.98 → 2255.98] That Psalm 130
[2255.98 → 2257.52] Starts with a cry
[2257.52 → 2258.24] For mercy
[2258.24 → 2260.22] As I mentioned
[2260.22 → 2261.38] My family and I
[2261.38 → 2262.32] We hit the road
[2262.32 → 2263.24] Frequently
[2263.24 → 2264.00] In the summers
[2264.00 → 2264.70] And we do these
[2264.70 → 2265.84] Five hour drives
[2265.84 → 2268.04] With virtually no pee breaks
[2268.04 → 2270.22] We are blessed
[2270.22 → 2271.62] We're blessed
[2271.62 → 2273.28] With pretty well-adjusted
[2273.28 → 2274.46] Travellers
[2274.46 → 2276.26] And I should mention
[2276.26 → 2277.06] It's amazing
[2277.06 → 2277.52] The difference
[2277.52 → 2278.74] That an iPad makes
[2278.74 → 2279.86] Alright
[2279.86 → 2281.00] So full disclosure
[2281.00 → 2283.04] We fully leverage
[2283.04 → 2283.96] Media
[2283.96 → 2284.86] For our kids
[2284.86 → 2286.46] But every time
[2286.46 → 2287.44] We wind
[2287.44 → 2288.00] Right through
[2288.00 → 2289.60] These mountain passes
[2289.60 → 2290.60] For hours
[2290.60 → 2292.32] And when we arrive
[2292.32 → 2293.32] At our destination
[2293.32 → 2295.02] I thank the good Lord
[2295.02 → 2296.40] For travelling mercies
[2296.40 → 2298.12] Because I know
[2298.12 → 2299.30] How it could have gone
[2299.30 → 2299.80] Right
[2299.80 → 2301.78] It could have been
[2301.78 → 2302.90] Are we there yet
[2302.90 → 2304.86] Every 15 minutes
[2304.86 → 2307.10] It could have been
[2307.10 → 2308.90] Car sick
[2308.90 → 2309.76] You know
[2309.76 → 2310.54] Motion sickness
[2310.54 → 2311.08] Car sickness
[2311.08 → 2311.76] It could have been
[2311.76 → 2312.90] Excuse me
[2312.90 → 2313.86] But barf bags
[2313.86 → 2314.76] Full to the brim
[2314.76 → 2316.62] It could have been
[2316.62 → 2317.96] Several pee breaks
[2317.96 → 2318.84] In Manning Park
[2318.84 → 2321.32] But God gave us
[2321.32 → 2322.60] Travelling mercies
[2322.60 → 2325.00] It also could have been
[2325.00 → 2325.80] Way worse
[2325.80 → 2329.28] Some of you
[2329.28 → 2330.56] May know my story
[2330.56 → 2332.10] But years ago
[2332.10 → 2332.82] I was involved
[2332.82 → 2334.38] In a near fatal car accident
[2334.38 → 2335.92] While travelling
[2335.92 → 2336.58] To church
[2336.58 → 2337.50] Of all places
[2337.50 → 2339.50] And, so I know
[2339.50 → 2341.12] How it could have gone
[2341.12 → 2342.98] I know
[2342.98 → 2345.00] What could have happened
[2345.00 → 2348.58] You'll know that
[2348.58 → 2350.08] My life is essentially
[2350.08 → 2351.08] One big
[2351.08 → 2352.54] Travelling mercy
[2352.54 → 2354.84] Mercy is defined
[2354.84 → 2355.60] As not getting
[2355.60 → 2356.40] What you deserve
[2356.40 → 2358.38] Or what you should have
[2358.38 → 2359.46] Had coming to you
[2359.46 → 2361.40] Now if you're at all
[2361.40 → 2361.78] Like me
[2361.78 → 2362.58] You're a traveller
[2362.58 → 2363.46] Who knows
[2363.46 → 2364.38] God's mercy
[2364.38 → 2367.64] Maybe you reflect
[2367.64 → 2369.14] That you should have
[2369.14 → 2370.08] Been passed over
[2370.08 → 2370.92] For that promotion
[2370.92 → 2374.08] You should have missed
[2374.08 → 2375.14] That deadline
[2375.14 → 2376.74] You should have not
[2376.74 → 2378.48] Recovered from that illness
[2378.48 → 2379.92] You should have
[2379.92 → 2380.92] Lost everything
[2380.92 → 2383.30] But you didn't get
[2383.30 → 2385.86] What was coming for you
[2385.86 → 2388.10] And that's mercy
[2388.10 → 2391.00] And the psalmist sings
[2391.00 → 2392.28] Out of the depths
[2392.28 → 2394.12] I cry to you Lord
[2394.12 → 2396.06] Lord hear my voice
[2396.06 → 2398.46] Let your ears be attentive
[2398.46 → 2400.08] To my cry for mercy
[2400.08 → 2402.22] Sometimes
[2402.22 → 2403.52] Mercy is
[2403.52 → 2404.10] Muted
[2404.10 → 2405.46] In our lives
[2405.46 → 2407.00] Because we don't
[2407.00 → 2407.88] Know
[2407.88 → 2408.98] How close
[2408.98 → 2409.68] We are
[2409.68 → 2410.94] To total catastrophe
[2410.94 → 2413.16] All we know
[2413.16 → 2414.02] Is what actually
[2414.02 → 2414.64] Happens
[2414.64 → 2415.92] But there's an
[2415.92 → 2416.74] Infinite number
[2416.74 → 2417.54] Of results
[2417.54 → 2418.26] That we are
[2418.26 → 2419.32] Mercifully
[2419.32 → 2420.28] Ignorant of
[2420.28 → 2422.80] We need to be
[2422.80 → 2423.62] Thankful for the
[2423.62 → 2425.00] Travelling mercies
[2425.00 → 2426.82] That sustain us
[2426.82 → 2428.06] In following Jesus
[2428.06 → 2428.90] Today
[2428.90 → 2431.68] When we're aware
[2431.68 → 2432.30] Of the travelling
[2432.30 → 2432.94] Mercies
[2432.94 → 2433.98] That have directed
[2433.98 → 2434.64] Our steps
[2434.64 → 2435.88] We revere
[2435.88 → 2438.34] We devote
[2438.34 → 2439.30] Ourselves
[2439.30 → 2440.38] We have great
[2440.38 → 2441.20] Adoration
[2441.20 → 2443.44] For the only one
[2443.44 → 2444.52] Who can forgive us
[2444.52 → 2446.42] When we stumble
[2446.42 → 2448.08] And fall
[2448.08 → 2450.50] And the one
[2450.50 → 2452.24] Who is forgiven
[2452.24 → 2454.64] Is the one
[2454.64 → 2455.74] Who understands
[2455.74 → 2456.20] Worship
[2456.20 → 2457.36] As a way of life
[2457.36 → 2459.54] This is the second
[2459.54 → 2460.10] Direction
[2460.10 → 2460.72] Or the second
[2460.72 → 2461.66] Learning we might
[2461.66 → 2462.02] Pull
[2462.02 → 2464.12] From the psalm
[2464.12 → 2465.22] Verse
[2465.22 → 2465.72] Three
[2465.72 → 2467.24] If you
[2467.24 → 2467.84] If you
[2467.84 → 2468.28] Lord
[2468.28 → 2469.80] Kept a record
[2469.80 → 2470.44] Of sins
[2470.44 → 2472.06] Lord who
[2472.06 → 2472.76] Could stand
[2472.76 → 2474.76] But with you
[2474.76 → 2475.80] There is forgiveness
[2475.80 → 2477.88] So that we can
[2477.88 → 2478.64] With reverence
[2478.64 → 2479.52] Serve you
[2479.52 → 2482.78] Here we see
[2482.78 → 2483.64] That forgiveness
[2483.64 → 2485.30] Leads to reverence
[2485.30 → 2486.42] And service
[2486.42 → 2488.42] Reverence
[2488.42 → 2489.46] And service
[2489.46 → 2490.98] A.k.a.
[2490.98 → 2491.38] Worship
[2491.38 → 2493.92] The only way
[2493.92 → 2494.62] To genuinely
[2494.62 → 2495.76] Understand Christian
[2495.76 → 2496.14] Faith
[2496.14 → 2496.64] Is through
[2496.64 → 2497.20] Worship
[2497.20 → 2499.08] See Christian
[2499.08 → 2499.72] Faith is
[2499.72 → 2501.52] It's not
[2501.52 → 2502.40] A distilled
[2502.40 → 2503.24] Set of
[2503.24 → 2504.88] Propositional
[2504.88 → 2505.38] Truths
[2506.42 → 2507.34] Or doctrine
[2507.34 → 2509.20] Christian
[2509.20 → 2509.82] Faith is
[2509.82 → 2510.34] A lived
[2510.34 → 2511.20] Experience
[2511.20 → 2512.02] Of the
[2512.02 → 2512.28] Living
[2512.28 → 2512.68] God
[2512.68 → 2514.34] Who has
[2514.34 → 2514.74] Drawn
[2514.74 → 2515.38] Near to
[2515.38 → 2515.82] Us
[2515.82 → 2516.10] In the
[2516.10 → 2516.44] Person
[2516.44 → 2516.64] Of
[2516.64 → 2516.96] Jesus
[2516.96 → 2518.58] And who
[2518.58 → 2519.36] Attends
[2519.36 → 2520.08] Us
[2520.08 → 2520.56] Every
[2520.56 → 2520.88] Moment
[2520.88 → 2521.22] By the
[2521.22 → 2521.52] Power
[2521.52 → 2521.78] Of the
[2521.78 → 2522.00] Holy
[2522.00 → 2522.42] Spirit
[2522.42 → 2524.14] So it's
[2524.14 → 2524.78] Not so
[2524.78 → 2525.12] Much
[2525.12 → 2526.14] That you
[2526.14 → 2526.56] Have to

[2528.22 → 2528.42] It
[2528.42 → 2529.98] It's
[2529.98 → 2530.42] That you
[2530.42 → 2530.80] Have
[2530.80 → 2531.06] To
[2531.06 → 2531.48] Live
[2531.48 → 2531.78] It
[2531.78 → 2533.20] To
[2533.20 → 2533.56] Learn
[2533.56 → 2533.88] It
[2533.88 → 2536.00] It's
[2536.00 → 2536.18] Been
[2536.18 → 2536.50] Said
[2536.50 → 2536.82] That
[2536.82 → 2539.30] What God
[2539.30 → 2539.58] Can
[2539.58 → 2540.20] Change
[2540.20 → 2540.92] In an
[2540.92 → 2541.46] Instant
[2541.46 → 2541.92] In
[2541.92 → 2542.22] Heaven
[2542.22 → 2543.68] He
[2543.68 → 2544.44] Relishes
[2544.44 → 2545.06] With
[2545.06 → 2545.58] Great
[2545.58 → 2546.06] Pleasure
[2546.06 → 2546.80] To

[2686.16 → 2687.10] Taste
[2687.10 → 2687.44] And
[2687.44 → 2687.92] See
[2687.92 → 2689.62] And
[2689.62 → 2689.74] They
[2689.74 → 2690.00] Will
[2690.00 → 2691.34] Experience
[2691.34 → 2691.60] The
[2691.60 → 2691.98] Raw

[2695.14 → 2695.38] So
[2695.38 → 2695.56] They
[2695.56 → 2695.70] Will
[2695.70 → 2696.00] Learn
[2696.00 → 2696.22] The
[2696.22 → 2696.56] Language
[2696.56 → 2696.80] Of
[2696.80 → 2697.18] Prayer
[2697.18 → 2699.60] And
[2699.60 → 2699.70] They
[2699.70 → 2699.82] Will
[2699.82 → 2700.30] Find
[2700.30 → 2700.52] The
[2700.52 → 2700.88] Lord
[2700.88 → 2701.44] There
[2701.44 → 2704.30] Nothing
[2704.30 → 2704.96] Describes
[2704.96 → 2705.38] Worship
[2705.38 → 2705.72] As
[2705.72 → 2705.88] A
[2705.88 → 2706.08] Way
[2706.08 → 2706.24] Of
[2706.24 → 2706.50] Life
[2706.50 → 2706.86] Better
[2706.86 → 2707.12] Than

[2710.54 → 2710.66] And
[2710.66 → 2710.86] 2
[2710.86 → 2711.94] I
[2711.94 → 2712.42] Appeal
[2712.42 → 2712.60] To
[2712.60 → 2712.76] You
[2712.76 → 2713.00] Paul
[2713.00 → 2713.36] Says
[2713.36 → 2713.90] Therefore
[2713.90 → 2715.38] Brothers
[2715.38 → 2715.72] And
[2715.72 → 2716.26] Sisters
[2716.26 → 2717.48] By
[2717.48 → 2717.64] The
[2717.64 → 2718.04] Mercies
[2718.04 → 2718.22] Of
[2718.22 → 2718.62] God
[2718.62 → 2720.46] There
[2720.46 → 2720.60] It
[2720.60 → 2720.94] Is
[2720.94 → 2721.70] Mercies
[2721.70 → 2723.04] To

[2723.38 → 2723.66] Your
[2723.66 → 2724.10] Bodies
[2724.10 → 2724.52] As
[2724.52 → 2724.70] A
[2724.70 → 2724.96] Living
[2724.96 → 2725.94] Sacrifice
[2725.94 → 2726.90] Holy
[2726.90 → 2727.18] And
[2727.18 → 2727.88] Acceptable
[2727.88 → 2728.08] To

[2729.08 → 2730.96] This
[2730.96 → 2731.14] Is
[2731.14 → 2731.30] Your
[2731.30 → 2731.92] Spiritual
[2731.92 → 2732.46] Act
[2732.46 → 2732.64] Of
[2732.64 → 2733.06] Worship
[2733.06 → 2734.50] Then
[2734.50 → 2734.72] Paul
[2734.72 → 2734.98] Says
[2734.98 → 2735.18] Do
[2735.18 → 2735.36] Not
[2735.36 → 2735.56] Be
[2735.56 → 2736.08] Conformed
[2736.08 → 2736.28] To

[2737.08 → 2737.92] Transformed
[2737.92 → 2738.24] By
[2738.24 → 2738.40] The
[2738.40 → 2738.84] Renewing
[2738.84 → 2738.98] Of
[2738.98 → 2739.10] Your
[2739.10 → 2739.48] Mind
[2739.48 → 2740.76] So
[2740.76 → 2740.92] That
[2740.92 → 2741.06] You
[2741.06 → 2741.24] May
[2741.24 → 2741.44] Be
[2741.44 → 2741.72] Able
[2741.72 → 2741.94] To
[2741.94 → 2742.36] Discern
[2742.36 → 2742.66] What
[2742.66 → 2743.08] Is
[2743.08 → 2743.44] The
[2743.44 → 2743.64] Will
[2743.64 → 2743.92] Of
[2743.92 → 2744.22] God
[2744.22 → 2744.44] What
[2744.44 → 2744.58] Is
[2744.58 → 2745.08] Good
[2745.08 → 2746.06] What
[2746.06 → 2746.20] Is
[2746.20 → 2747.02] Pleasing
[2747.02 → 2747.38] What
[2747.38 → 2747.52] Is
[2747.52 → 2748.44] Perfect
[2748.44 → 2751.54] As
[2751.54 → 2751.68] We
[2751.68 → 2752.04] Learn
[2752.04 → 2752.26] That
[2752.26 → 2752.66] Worship
[2752.66 → 2752.90] Is
[2752.90 → 2753.04] A

[2756.06 → 2758.26] Verses
[2758.26 → 2758.60] Five
[2758.60 → 2758.78] And
[2758.78 → 2759.18] Six
[2759.18 → 2760.76] Hope
[2760.76 → 2760.96] Is
[2760.96 → 2761.14] A
[2761.14 → 2761.62] Junction
[2761.62 → 2764.20] Literally
[2764.20 → 2764.48] I
[2764.48 → 2764.58] Mean
[2764.58 → 2764.74] The
[2764.74 → 2765.04] Town
[2765.04 → 2765.20] Of
[2765.20 → 2765.48] Hope
[2765.48 → 2765.66] Is
[2765.66 → 2765.80] A
[2765.80 → 2766.22] Junction
[2766.22 → 2770.30] Whenever
[2770.30 → 2770.66] We
[2770.66 → 2771.34] Travel
[2771.34 → 2771.54] To
[2771.54 → 2771.64] The
[2771.64 → 2772.14] Okanagan
[2772.14 → 2772.80] Simokamine
[2772.80 → 2773.22] And
[2773.22 → 2774.14] Go
[2774.14 → 2774.38] Visit
[2774.38 → 2774.78] Family
[2774.78 → 2774.98] At
[2774.98 → 2775.10] The
[2775.10 → 2775.50] Cabin
[2775.50 → 2775.82] We
[2775.82 → 2776.06] Go
[2776.06 → 2776.34] Through
[2776.34 → 2776.76] Hope
[2776.76 → 2778.68] You
[2778.68 → 2779.14] Have
[2779.14 → 2779.28] To
[2779.28 → 2779.42] Go
[2779.42 → 2779.62] Through
[2779.62 → 2779.88] Hope
[2779.88 → 2780.14] Hope
[2780.14 → 2780.30] Is
[2780.30 → 2780.44] A
[2780.44 → 2780.84] Junction
[2780.84 → 2781.18] You've
[2781.18 → 2781.34] Got
[2781.34 → 2781.78] Highway
[2781.78 → 2782.60] Five

[2783.30 → 2783.52] And
[2783.52 → 2783.88] Seven
[2783.88 → 2784.14] All
[2784.14 → 2784.70] Converging
[2784.70 → 2785.38] There
[2785.38 → 2787.30] But
[2787.30 → 2788.12] Spiritually
[2788.12 → 2789.26] Hope
[2789.26 → 2791.12] Is
[2791.12 → 2791.28] A
[2791.28 → 2791.72] Junction
[2791.72 → 2793.48] It
[2793.48 → 2793.76] Opens
[2793.76 → 2793.92] Up
[2793.92 → 2794.12] New
[2794.12 → 2794.94] Possibilities
[2794.94 → 2795.28] It
[2795.28 → 2795.54] Opens
[2795.54 → 2795.70] Up
[2795.70 → 2795.88] New
[2795.88 → 2796.66] Directions
[2796.66 → 2798.58] Until
[2798.58 → 2798.94] Now
[2798.94 → 2799.16] That
[2799.16 → 2799.88] We
[2799.88 → 2800.26] Never
[2800.26 → 2800.58] Knew
[2800.58 → 2800.88] Were
[2800.88 → 2801.28] Available
[2801.28 → 2801.56] To
[2801.56 → 2801.98] Us
[2801.98 → 2803.88] The
[2803.88 → 2804.44] Psalmist
[2804.44 → 2804.80] Sings
[2804.80 → 2805.00] In
[2805.00 → 2805.20] Verse
[2805.20 → 2805.64] Five
[2805.64 → 2806.10] I
[2806.10 → 2806.50] Will
[2806.50 → 2807.06] Wait
[2807.06 → 2807.40] Or
[2807.40 → 2807.56] I
[2807.56 → 2807.96] Wait
[2807.96 → 2808.16] For
[2808.16 → 2808.36] The
[2808.36 → 2808.64] Lord
[2808.64 → 2809.30] My
[2809.30 → 2809.64] Whole
[2809.64 → 2809.98] Being
[2809.98 → 2810.50] Waits
[2810.50 → 2811.32] And
[2811.32 → 2811.46] In
[2811.46 → 2812.38] His
[2812.38 → 2812.66] Word
[2812.66 → 2812.84] I
[2812.84 → 2813.04] Put
[2813.04 → 2813.28] My
[2813.28 → 2813.62] Hope
[2813.62 → 2814.90] I
[2814.90 → 2815.18] Wait
[2815.18 → 2815.36] For
[2815.36 → 2815.52] The
[2815.52 → 2815.74] Lord
[2815.74 → 2816.00] More
[2816.00 → 2816.16] Than
[2816.16 → 2816.74] Watchmen
[2816.74 → 2816.96] Wait
[2816.96 → 2817.12] For
[2817.12 → 2817.26] The
[2817.26 → 2817.58] Morning
[2817.58 → 2818.86] More
[2818.86 → 2819.06] Than
[2819.06 → 2819.84] Watchmen
[2819.84 → 2820.60] Wait
[2820.60 → 2820.84] For
[2820.84 → 2820.98] The
[2820.98 → 2821.32] Morning
[2821.32 → 2822.62] See
[2822.62 → 2822.88] Hope
[2822.88 → 2823.24] Means
[2823.24 → 2823.60] I
[2823.60 → 2824.44] I
[2824.44 → 2834.40] Hope
[2834.40 → 2834.48] I
[2834.48 → 2834.82] Hope
[2834.82 → 2834.90] I
[2834.90 → 2835.70] Hope
[2835.70 → 2836.38] God
[2836.38 → 2836.92] Take
[2836.92 → 2837.10] Me
[2837.10 → 2837.34] The
[2837.34 → 2837.62] Whole
[2837.62 → 2837.94] Way
[2837.94 → 2839.60] It's
[2839.60 → 2839.76] Not
[2839.76 → 2839.92] So
[2839.92 → 2840.08] Much
[2840.08 → 2840.26] That
[2840.26 → 2840.48] I'm
[2840.48 → 2840.92] Willing
[2840.92 → 2841.54] Myself
[2841.54 → 2842.04] Forward
[2842.04 → 2842.40] With
[2842.40 → 2842.64] Every
[2842.64 → 2843.16] Step
[2843.16 → 2843.36] As
[2843.36 → 2843.76] Much
[2843.76 → 2844.06] As
[2844.06 → 2844.24] It
[2844.24 → 2844.54] Is
[2844.54 → 2846.04] God
[2846.04 → 2846.26] Is
[2846.26 → 2846.66] Giving
[2846.66 → 2847.04] Me
[2847.04 → 2847.32] The
[2847.32 → 2847.96] Strength
[2847.96 → 2851.30] to desire moving forward with him.
[2853.98 → 2855.32] Verse 5 says,
[2855.54 → 2857.72] In his word I put my hope.
[2858.80 → 2860.80] See, hope in the word of God is meaningful
[2860.80 → 2863.08] because it has grounds.
[2864.44 → 2866.64] When hope is based on God's word,
[2866.64 → 2869.40] or when hope is based on what God says,
[2869.70 → 2872.82] it's then based on God's actions in history.
[2872.82 → 2878.58] In short, hope is based on what God does.
[2879.88 → 2880.38] Why?
[2881.78 → 2886.06] Because God's being and action are one and the same.
[2887.78 → 2890.36] From verse 5 when the psalmist says,
[2890.54 → 2892.00] In his word I put my hope.
[2892.30 → 2894.58] To verse 7 when he says,
[2894.74 → 2896.76] Israel, put your hope in the Lord.
[2897.40 → 2900.96] The implication is that God's word is who God is.
[2900.96 → 2903.76] He does what he says.
[2904.70 → 2906.88] And when we put our hope in God's word,
[2907.62 → 2909.70] we can go anywhere.
[2911.18 → 2913.92] Most importantly, with hope in hand,
[2914.44 → 2918.04] we can be led down the road to redemption.
[2918.50 → 2921.08] This is our fourth learning, our fourth direction.
[2922.18 → 2923.18] In Psalm 130.
[2925.38 → 2926.44] Verse 7.
[2927.72 → 2930.90] Israel, put your hope in the Lord.
[2930.96 → 2934.32] For with the Lord is unfailing love.
[2935.06 → 2936.46] And with him is full redemption.
[2937.42 → 2940.78] He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[2942.62 → 2943.88] Yes, he will.
[2945.04 → 2951.22] See, God didn't send somebody else to do his dirty work, did he?
[2953.22 → 2955.88] God sent his one and only son, Jesus.
[2955.88 → 2957.74] See, God sent his one and only son.
[2958.38 → 2963.82] Note that the psalm starts with mercy and ends with redemption.
[2965.16 → 2969.82] See, mercy is when God withholds the punishment that we deserve.
[2969.82 → 2976.98] And redemption is when God reveals the love we don't deserve.
[2979.38 → 2981.02] We might think of it this way.
[2981.28 → 2987.76] Mercy and grace are the front and back door of God's house,
[2987.76 → 2990.10] as depicted in Psalm 130.
[2991.10 → 2994.06] Now, if you're like me, when you come into the presence of God,
[2994.82 → 2999.48] you might come into the house tracking all sorts of dirt everywhere.
[2999.48 → 3003.10] You may come in a hurry.
[3003.78 → 3006.88] You may come with a lot of unnecessary baggage.
[3007.74 → 3010.30] You may come with hurt and unhealed wounds.
[3011.44 → 3018.72] But if you're like me, you've heard that there's always a seat set aside for you in God's house.
[3018.72 → 3026.26] There's always a seat for you, just as there was a seat for the ancient pilgrim in the temple.
[3027.32 → 3029.12] It's called the mercy seat.
[3030.66 → 3031.84] Let me explain.
[3032.66 → 3036.54] Every year, on the tenth day of the seventh month,
[3036.76 → 3041.64] the Israelites would celebrate the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur.
[3041.64 → 3046.16] And on that day, the high priest would enter into the Holy of Holies,
[3046.58 → 3048.60] where the Ark of the Covenant rested.
[3049.96 → 3051.16] And above the Ark,
[3052.10 → 3057.24] and the Ark was understood to be the place where the divine presence dwelt,
[3058.58 → 3062.04] above the Ark, there was this lid or cover.
[3062.94 → 3064.76] And this was called the mercy seat.
[3065.94 → 3069.02] It's really the best seat in the house.
[3069.02 → 3074.24] Because it was here where the high priest sprinkled the blood of the goat,
[3074.90 → 3077.50] which atoned for the sins of God's people.
[3078.90 → 3085.64] The mercy seat is the place where a holy God meets with his unholy people.
[3087.10 → 3094.44] It's here where we realize that we don't get what is coming for us.
[3094.44 → 3100.50] Today, we might think of the mercy seat as a place of honour,
[3100.62 → 3103.54] because it's where Christ's blood covers us.
[3104.62 → 3107.84] Like the Israelite pilgrims that entered Solomon's temple,
[3108.46 → 3112.32] we're able to stand in the presence of God today because of his mercy.
[3113.32 → 3117.70] See, mercy is the front door to the presence of God.
[3117.70 → 3124.62] Likewise, if mercy, right, not getting what we deserve is the front door,
[3125.76 → 3131.96] then grace, getting what we don't deserve, is the back door.
[3132.96 → 3137.72] It's by the grace of God that we are sent
[3137.72 → 3143.64] from and surely with the presence of God.
[3145.34 → 3150.30] Having entered in mercy, we leave having been redeemed.
[3151.94 → 3154.76] We may have come in by God's mercy,
[3155.02 → 3159.02] dirty and deserving of everything that we have brought down on ourselves,
[3159.02 → 3164.36] but the good news of Jesus is that while we popped by his house,
[3164.82 → 3168.16] he did the laundry, so to speak.
[3169.18 → 3172.08] In God's unfailing love, he redeemed.
[3172.62 → 3175.68] That means he reconciled and made us right.
[3176.52 → 3179.84] Every stain, every loose stitch,
[3180.80 → 3185.24] every wrinkle and every tear on our person and character
[3185.24 → 3187.78] has been restored.
[3189.02 → 3192.86] Now, you and I, because of God's unfailing love,
[3193.02 → 3196.48] get to leave his presence clothed in Christ.
[3200.24 → 3204.86] Now, this was a concealed revelation
[3204.86 → 3208.80] for God's people, for the Israelites in the Old Testament,
[3209.36 → 3212.70] but it is revealed for us today.
[3214.44 → 3217.48] To the first hearers of this song,
[3217.48 → 3221.16] hearing this promise as an ancient Israelite,
[3221.48 → 3225.46] the Lord himself will redeem Israel from all their sins,
[3225.94 → 3229.58] this would have been a wildly hopeful notion.
[3231.58 → 3234.92] To contemplate, for an ancient Israelite to contemplate
[3234.92 → 3237.50] that God himself would redeem them,
[3237.50 → 3240.38] it would have blown their minds.
[3242.96 → 3246.14] Long before Jesus is born into this world of ours,
[3246.96 → 3250.28] before God takes on flesh in the person of Jesus,
[3250.70 → 3252.50] Israelites would have been spellbound.
[3252.90 → 3257.16] They would have been besought by this promise.
[3257.16 → 3259.16] It is one thing.
[3259.16 → 3260.40] It is one thing.
[3261.40 → 3264.24] It is one thing for them to sing about it
[3264.24 → 3265.38] on their way to the temple.
[3266.34 → 3267.18] But we,
[3267.88 → 3271.00] who stand on the other side of the cross,
[3271.72 → 3273.98] we possess the joy
[3273.98 → 3275.92] of seeing it
[3275.92 → 3277.50] through the cross.
[3277.50 → 3283.12] The cross of Jesus
[3283.12 → 3287.24] can be likened to cross-hairs,
[3287.98 → 3290.72] to something,
[3290.82 → 3294.82] a mark that draws us in.
[3295.82 → 3299.00] The cross of Jesus is our sight line.
[3300.14 → 3302.14] If we want to know where to put our hope,
[3303.08 → 3303.88] the cross
[3303.88 → 3304.90] cross
[3304.90 → 3306.20] marks the spot.
[3307.96 → 3311.36] If we want to see the unfailing love of God for us
[3311.36 → 3313.82] demonstrably clear and manifest,
[3314.54 → 3317.40] it will be by looking on that wooden frame
[3317.40 → 3320.04] that held the portrait of love.
[3321.18 → 3325.18] No greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.
[3327.52 → 3329.88] In comparison to an ancient Israelite,
[3330.26 → 3332.00] think about how much more in focus
[3332.00 → 3334.12] God's redemption is for us.
[3335.42 → 3336.50] Seeing it through
[3336.50 → 3339.36] the frame of Jesus' death on the cross.
[3340.76 → 3342.94] John the Baptist was the first to see it.
[3343.04 → 3343.82] What did he say?
[3344.28 → 3344.74] He said,
[3344.98 → 3345.34] look,
[3345.92 → 3347.02] the Lamb of God
[3347.02 → 3348.90] who takes away the sin of the world.
[3350.58 → 3351.62] And now,
[3351.78 → 3352.52] you and I
[3352.52 → 3355.00] have the benefit of looking on Jesus
[3355.00 → 3357.02] and the sacrifice
[3357.02 → 3358.28] he made
[3358.28 → 3360.86] to break the powers of sin
[3360.86 → 3361.62] and death
[3361.62 → 3362.04] by
[3362.04 → 3363.32] his death
[3363.32 → 3364.82] and resurrection.
[3366.76 → 3367.82] And to us,
[3367.94 → 3369.14] there is no better sight
[3369.14 → 3370.28] to behold than that.
[3370.68 → 3370.90] Amen?
[3370.90 → 3371.04] Amen?
[3375.78 → 3376.86] My friends,
[3377.06 → 3378.38] the cross of Jesus
[3378.38 → 3381.16] is the frame
[3381.16 → 3383.34] to find ourselves in.
[3385.00 → 3387.42] if you want to know
[3387.42 → 3388.48] who you are
[3388.48 → 3391.14] and what you should do
[3391.14 → 3391.92] with your life,
[3392.72 → 3393.60] with the days
[3393.60 → 3394.66] that have been given to you,
[3395.66 → 3397.54] you start with God's mercy.
[3398.92 → 3399.88] You're forgiven.
[3399.88 → 3403.34] And that should give you hope.
[3405.26 → 3406.84] Let hope arise
[3406.84 → 3408.86] to realize
[3408.86 → 3411.00] the unfailing love of God for you,
[3411.12 → 3412.20] that you are redeemed
[3412.20 → 3413.26] by God himself.
[3414.88 → 3416.50] Let this, church,
[3416.98 → 3418.06] be your song.
[3419.34 → 3421.10] Your song of ascents.
[3422.26 → 3423.54] Would you join me in prayer?
[3423.54 → 3429.22] Heavenly Father,
[3429.36 → 3430.38] your word is good.
[3431.22 → 3432.56] It is indeed a lamp
[3432.56 → 3433.46] unto our feet.
[3435.02 → 3436.58] We don't always know,
[3436.86 → 3436.94] Lord,
[3437.12 → 3437.60] how to,
[3437.60 → 3439.72] how to walk
[3439.72 → 3440.66] in your way,
[3441.42 → 3443.30] what steps to take,
[3444.18 → 3445.94] what would resemble
[3445.94 → 3447.24] faith and trust
[3447.24 → 3448.16] in your character,
[3448.68 → 3450.32] and what is only
[3450.32 → 3451.74] our own effort
[3451.74 → 3452.66] and striving.
[3454.54 → 3455.46] Holy Spirit,
[3455.62 → 3457.08] would you illumine
[3457.08 → 3458.18] the way of Jesus
[3458.18 → 3458.98] for us
[3458.98 → 3460.76] through your word
[3460.76 → 3461.62] as preached?
[3463.06 → 3465.00] Going from this place,
[3466.68 → 3467.92] embracing worship
[3467.92 → 3469.52] as a way of life,
[3470.42 → 3471.52] attributing glory
[3471.52 → 3473.30] to where it is due,
[3473.30 → 3476.36] heralding your kingdom.
[3477.36 → 3478.78] We ask, Lord,
[3479.48 → 3480.96] that you would,
[3481.16 → 3482.30] by your power,
[3482.44 → 3483.98] make us sure-footed,
[3484.54 → 3486.80] give us a sense
[3486.80 → 3487.52] of direction
[3487.52 → 3488.42] that is not
[3488.42 → 3489.62] our own,
[3490.62 → 3492.84] and send us
[3492.84 → 3495.06] to lead others
[3495.06 → 3496.46] also along the journey
[3496.46 → 3498.80] in following
[3498.80 → 3500.06] the way of Jesus,
[3500.54 → 3500.98] your son.
[3500.98 → 3503.86] we pray this
[3503.86 → 3505.72] in your holy name
[3505.72 → 3506.86] together in faith.
[3508.00 → 3508.38] Amen.
[3508.38 → 3508.58] Amen.
[3508.58 → 3531.00] You may rise.
[3531.56 → 3532.64] I believe we will be
[3532.64 → 3534.26] singing the song,
[3535.20 → 3536.34] My Soul Longs
[3536.34 → 3536.90] for the Lord.
[3536.90 → 3536.96] Amen.
[3538.58 → 3555.06] I so long for the Lord
[3555.06 → 3559.10] in a weary land.
[3559.10 → 3560.80] The words are dry
[3560.80 → 3562.86] and I am empty,
[3563.28 → 3566.70] only dust in my hands.
[3566.70 → 3569.42] Now I err for streams
[3569.42 → 3570.58] of mercy,
[3571.04 → 3572.68] where my soul
[3572.68 → 3574.76] can be restart.
[3574.98 → 3576.14] Now I'm praying,
[3576.32 → 3578.84] Jesus calls me,
[3579.18 → 3582.18] and you will first know all.
[3582.18 → 3586.24] For the fullness of Christ,
[3586.68 → 3587.92] word of God,
[3588.08 → 3590.18] word of God.
[3590.18 → 3604.14] in the quiet of the morning,
[3604.14 → 3605.30] every whisper,
[3605.30 → 3607.28] every promise,
[3607.28 → 3610.96] calls my heart to rejoice.
[3610.96 → 3614.96] in the quiet of the night,
[3614.96 → 3615.00] through the light,
[3615.00 → 3619.00] through the watches of the night,
[3619.00 → 3623.06] in the fire of the struggles,
[3623.06 → 3626.76] there's courage for the fight,
[3626.76 → 3630.56] for the power of Christ,
[3630.98 → 3632.24] word of God,
[3632.34 → 3634.80] word of life.
[3634.80 → 3636.52] Lord of God,
[3636.52 → 3640.62] I dwell on the night,
[3640.62 → 3644.28] my soul longs to walk closer,
[3644.66 → 3648.12] with the Lord I serve.
[3648.12 → 3649.92] More than riches,
[3650.52 → 3651.80] more than favour,
[3652.14 → 3655.78] I delight in your word.
[3656.16 → 3659.54] Turn my gaze from all that's worthless,
[3660.10 → 3662.98] send my heart to things above,
[3662.98 → 3671.34] May my heart tell your goodness, your way of truth and love,
[3671.76 → 3679.30] on the wisdom of Christ, word of God, word of life.
[3692.98 → 3704.88] Thank you, Pastor Jesse, for bringing us such a great taste of God's word.
[3705.66 → 3708.14] You're correct, Jason is travelling this week.
[3708.20 → 3712.06] In fact, yesterday, him and I were just texting back and forth about water filters.
[3712.20 → 3715.68] He's on a canoe trip with his whole family out in the Barren Lakes.
[3716.32 → 3720.44] And actually, on the note of water filters, this morning's offering is actually on,
[3720.44 → 3728.18] or for Life Water Canada, which is an organization that drills wells throughout all of Africa and Haiti.
[3728.40 → 3731.22] So it goes without saying, that's a really important work.
[3731.56 → 3733.34] And, so please give as you're able.
[3750.44 → 3780.42] Thank you.
[3780.44 → 3810.42] Thank you.
[3810.44 → 3840.42] Thank you.
[3840.44 → 3842.44] Thank you.
[3845.90 → 3849.88] At this point, we'll come to God in a time of congregational prayer,
[3850.42 → 3854.00] as has been our tradition over the last few months, started by Pastor Jason.
[3854.14 → 3859.16] We'll recite the Lord's Prayer together at the end to conclude the congregational prayer.
[3859.16 → 3861.50] So let's bow our heads and come to God.
[3861.50 → 3869.48] Holy, holy, holy God, who was and is and is to come.
[3869.48 → 3873.48] We gather here together this morning to glorify your name.
[3873.48 → 3877.06] For yours is a name above all names.
[3877.06 → 3878.92] You said, let there be light.
[3878.92 → 3879.92] And there was light.
[3879.92 → 3886.60] With a word, you separated the day from the night, the heavens from the earth, the waters from the dry land.
[3886.60 → 3893.30] You filled the earth with living creatures and then set humanity apart, made in your image.
[3893.30 → 3896.68] What a blessing you have bestowed on us.
[3896.68 → 3904.10] What other response is there other than to worship you with all of our heart, our soul, our lips, our hands.
[3905.02 → 3906.92] Anything less would be a disgrace.
[3906.92 → 3912.42] And yet, Lord, we often find ourselves exactly here.
[3912.42 → 3914.76] We have fallen painfully short.
[3914.76 → 3919.32] Our worship is often half-hearted at best, if not totally absent.
[3919.32 → 3925.16] We relegate it to Sunday morning, and even here, it feels like a burden sometimes, rather than an honour.
[3925.16 → 3931.46] Our lips confess allegiance to false gods, and our hands work towards goals that are contrary to your kingdom.
[3931.46 → 3936.90] Yes, our hearts and souls are driven to worship, but shamefully, it's a worship of your creation.
[3936.92 → 3939.92] Rather than you, our creator.
[3939.92 → 3945.44] In light of our sin, your judgment upon us is both appropriate and fair.
[3945.44 → 3949.34] But in your infinite mercy, even here you meet us.
[3949.34 → 3951.92] You lift us up and heal us.
[3951.92 → 3960.24] While we were still sinners, you sent Jesus, your one and only son, to take the punishment our sins justly deserve.
[3960.24 → 3963.56] Your grace is purifying and edifying.
[3963.56 → 3971.08] May we turn from wickedness and instead walk in your ways, as you created us to do.
[3971.08 → 3976.08] We ask that your church here in Ladder be an example of your goodness.
[3976.08 → 3987.08] May the worship ministries here be glorifying to you, and not hidden away in this building, but instead spread throughout the whole community, both here and in Ladder, and further abroad.
[3987.08 → 3997.60] We ask that you guide this work through your Holy Spirit.
[3997.60 → 4000.08] Help us, Lord.
[4000.08 → 4006.96] Our broken world is embroiled in violence, and we feel powerless.
[4006.96 → 4012.34] How can we further your kingdom work in a world so overwhelmed by sin?
[4012.34 → 4018.62] Every day we read about bloodshed in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan.
[4018.62 → 4025.50] And now even we hear on the news yesterday that there was an assassination attempt in the United States on Donald Trump.
[4025.50 → 4029.30] The world is just so full of anger and hatred.
[4029.30 → 4033.54] We beg you, Lord, for a full measure of your sovereignty.
[4033.54 → 4036.46] Grant wisdom to the leaders of this world.
[4036.46 → 4038.86] Where there is hatred, bring love.
[4038.86 → 4041.30] Where there is poverty, bring relief.
[4041.30 → 4043.30] Where there is despair, bring hope.
[4043.30 → 4047.22] Where there is sadness, bring joy.
[4047.22 → 4051.24] We ask for your mercy for the afflicted members of this church.
[4051.24 → 4059.28] We pray for those who are sick with cancer, with heart conditions, and for those battling chronic illnesses and suffering the effects of old age.
[4059.28 → 4072.74] We pray for Ellie, Carl, George, Jerry, Shirley, Eileen, Diane, Hank, Liz, and Tony.
[4072.74 → 4078.84] These are our dear friends and family, and it pains us to see them suffering like this.
[4078.84 → 4081.40] Bring healing and relief, Lord.
[4081.40 → 4085.32] Be with Kikuyu and his family as he continues to recover at home.
[4085.32 → 4090.78] And we rejoice, Lord, in the news that Grace is now home from the hospital and healed of her infection.
[4090.78 → 4094.82] We thank you for the attentive and capable medical staff who cared for them.
[4094.82 → 4102.82] Lift those I have mentioned here today, and also lift those who are suffering silently from unseen afflictions.
[4102.82 → 4109.14] You, Lord, are the great physician, and all good things come from you and you alone.
[4109.14 → 4112.88] You conquered the grave and paid our debt of our many sins.
[4112.88 → 4115.80] And through the resurrection, we may come to eternal life.
[4116.56 → 4119.70] Jesus, truly, you are the Son of God.
[4120.48 → 4126.34] May we be compelled to sing your praises from the depths of our souls, for you alone are worthy.
[4128.02 → 4131.20] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4131.88 → 4136.62] Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4136.62 → 4143.26] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors.
[4144.08 → 4147.26] Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[4147.52 → 4151.52] For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
[4152.20 → 4152.50] Amen.
[4154.84 → 4160.02] At this point, I'd like to invite Pastor Jesse back up to bring us a travelling benediction.
[4160.02 → 4164.18] Thank you, Ryan.
[4165.80 → 4168.36] Church, would you rise and receive this blessing?
[4169.80 → 4177.20] Whether you are travelling this summer, whether you are at home with your loved ones and in God's presence,
[4178.26 → 4180.52] receive this blessing and go in peace.
