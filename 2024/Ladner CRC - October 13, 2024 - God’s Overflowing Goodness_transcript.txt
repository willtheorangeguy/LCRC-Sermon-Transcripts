[20.08 --> 22.08]  Amen.

[230.08 --> 232.08]  Amen.
[260.08 --> 262.08]  Amen.
[290.08 --> 292.08]  Good morning to you all.
[292.08 --> 294.08]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[294.08 --> 296.08]  Thank you.
[296.08 --> 300.08]  So, welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[300.08 --> 301.08]  My name is Jason.
[301.08 --> 302.08]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[302.08 --> 305.08]  And it is wonderful to worship with you this morning.
[305.08 --> 311.08]  And so, if you have your bulletin, I just want to draw your attention to a few announcements as we get going.
[311.08 --> 317.08]  One is that next Sunday, we'll resume our cross-training class on the Canons of Dort.
[317.08 --> 319.08]  Everyone is welcome to pop in.
[319.08 --> 321.08]  And as we learn together.
[321.08 --> 326.08]  Another one is that there is a card on the foyer table for Hannah Vanderkamp.
[326.08 --> 331.08]  She is a missionary that we are supporting for her work in Greece, working amongst refugees.
[331.08 --> 333.08]  And so, this is just a way to encourage her.
[333.08 --> 340.08]  So, we invite everybody from our congregation to sign their name, write a small note of encouragement to her.
[340.08 --> 342.08]  And let's fill up the card.
[342.08 --> 347.08]  And Dawn and Marian will be going to visit and to serve for a month in November.
[347.08 --> 350.08]  And they will take the card with them when they go.
[350.08 --> 355.08]  Some big news, technological advancement with our church.
[355.08 --> 358.08]  We are now accepting e-transfer giving.
[358.08 --> 359.08]  Wow.
[359.08 --> 362.08]  So, I know we've...
[362.08 --> 363.08]  Anyway, this is good.
[363.08 --> 368.08]  So, I hope this is a convenient way for you to give if you would like to use that method.
[368.08 --> 372.08]  And there's the email address listed in our bulletin.
[372.08 --> 383.08]  And you do need to make sure that you have already kind of registered with the office and have an envelope number so that we can know who you are when you give that way.
[383.08 --> 387.08]  There's a soup and bun luncheon coming up November 10.
[387.08 --> 390.08]  There's a sign-up sheet for soup and buns on the foyer table.
[390.08 --> 393.08]  And a last call for a membership class.
[393.08 --> 395.08]  We have, I think, five people signed up.
[395.08 --> 401.08]  But if you kind of want to also learn more about our church, it's like an intro to Lander CRC.
[401.08 --> 404.08]  Or if you're also hoping to become a member, please do join the class.
[404.08 --> 406.08]  We'll be starting up soon.
[406.08 --> 414.08]  So, with that, let's turn our hearts to the Lord in worship this morning.
[414.08 --> 417.08]  God gathers us together.
[417.08 --> 423.08]  He is the one who calls us into his courts, into his presence to worship.
[423.08 --> 427.08]  So, let's hear our call to worship this morning from Psalm 136.
[427.08 --> 429.08]  This will be a call in response.
[429.08 --> 431.08]  So, please join with me.
[431.08 --> 435.08]  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good.
[435.08 --> 439.08]  His love endures forever.
[439.08 --> 443.08]  Who by his understanding made the heavens.
[443.08 --> 446.08]  His love endures forever.
[446.08 --> 452.08]  Who made the sun to govern the day, the moon, and stars to govern the night.
[452.08 --> 455.08]  His love endures forever.
[455.08 --> 458.08]  To him who led his people through the wilderness.
[458.08 --> 461.08]  His love endures forever.
[461.08 --> 464.08]  He gives food to every creature.
[464.08 --> 467.08]  His love endures forever.
[467.08 --> 470.08]  Give thanks to the God of heaven.
[470.08 --> 473.08]  His love endures forever.
[473.08 --> 479.08]  Would you join me in a prayer of praise and adoration to our God as we worship him.
[479.08 --> 480.08]  Let's pray together.
[480.08 --> 484.08]  Almighty God, Lord of heaven and earth.
[484.08 --> 488.08]  In you we live and move and have our being.
[488.08 --> 493.08]  You make the sun to rise on the evil and on the good.
[493.08 --> 496.08]  You send rain on the just and on the unjust.
[496.08 --> 501.08]  Gracious God, your heart abounds with goodness.
[501.08 --> 504.08]  Your hand pours forth abundance.
[504.08 --> 508.08]  We praise you for the beauty of autumn.
[508.08 --> 512.08]  We praise you for the seasons of seed time and of harvest.
[512.08 --> 516.08]  Thank you for being our good shepherd who is always with us.
[516.08 --> 517.08]  Who never leaves us.
[517.08 --> 519.08]  Who cares for us.
[519.08 --> 521.08]  Every step of our journey.
[521.08 --> 525.08]  Thank you for welcoming us to worship you this morning.
[525.08 --> 528.08]  And also Lord for speaking to us through your word.
[528.08 --> 531.08]  By your Holy Spirit, Lord inhabit our praise.
[531.08 --> 535.08]  Enable us to lift our hearts to you in worship.
[535.08 --> 537.08]  And in great thanksgiving.
[537.08 --> 546.08]  We join our hearts and our voices this morning with all of your creation in worshiping you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[546.08 --> 548.08]  We pray in Christ's name and for his sake.
[548.08 --> 549.08]  Amen.
[549.08 --> 556.08]  Let's all stand and receive the Lord's greeting to us this morning.
[556.08 --> 558.08]  God says this to us.
[558.08 --> 566.08]  May the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you are called in one body and be thankful.
[566.08 --> 571.08]  So as the Lord has called us and greeted us, let's turn and let's greet those around us.
[571.08 --> 573.08]  Amen.

[845.38 --> 849.72]  With sharpness gives the blood,
[850.32 --> 853.80]  And still is our today.

[905.50 --> 910.72]  The Father now redeemed
[910.72 --> 917.22]  The Son that we have made
[917.22 --> 922.42]  Who may be my entail
[922.42 --> 928.42]  The one eternal God
[928.94 --> 933.42]  Who will ever adore
[933.42 --> 939.42]  Who knows it, knows it's not
[939.42 --> 944.42]  That shall be ever one
[944.42 --> 949.20]  Thank you. You may be seated.
[952.42 --> 959.42]  Thank you.
[959.42 --> 967.42]  Okay, so I think we will continue now to worship with a time of confession and assurance.
[967.42 --> 997.42] 
[997.42 --> 1004.42]  Let's pray for a moment of confession as we turn to our merciful Savior together. Please join me in prayer.
[1004.42 --> 1010.42]  Lord, we confess that we forget about you, the one from whom all blessings flow.
[1010.42 --> 1020.42]  Lord, we forget to love you. We forget to love our neighbors. We forget to thank you for your many gifts to us.
[1020.42 --> 1050.40]  So, Lord, we ask you to forgive us. Grant us, O Lord, by your grace, renewed minds to know you and new hearts to love you and strong hands, Lord, to serve you and to live for you in this world. Help us to live this day and this week and always so that our whole lives are one that are lived out in thanksgiving to you. We pray in the name of Jesus.
[1050.40 --> 1054.54]  Jesus, our Savior, our Savior, our Savior, our Savior, our Redeemer. Amen.
[1054.54 --> 1062.34]  So now let's hear and receive these words of God's pardon and of his grace to us.
[1062.34 --> 1064.98]  From Psalm 103, it says,
[1064.98 --> 1072.26]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him.
[1072.94 --> 1081.04]  As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
[1081.90 --> 1082.78]  Thanks be to God.
[1082.78 --> 1091.22]  Let's stand again and let's sing our next song together.
[1092.26 --> 1093.34]  You are my king.
[1093.34 --> 1093.36]  You are my king.
[1112.78 --> 1122.26]  I'm forgiven.
[1122.26 --> 1127.22]  I'm forgiven.
[1127.22 --> 1129.22]  I'm forgiven.
[1129.22 --> 1131.42]  I'm forgiven.
[1131.42 --> 1135.18]  Because you are the Savior.
[1135.18 --> 1136.70]  I'm forgiven.
[1136.70 --> 1139.08]  I'm forgiven.
[1139.08 --> 1142.78]  You are forgiven.
[1142.78 --> 1143.70]  I'm forgiven.
[1143.70 --> 1144.32]  I'm a badass heaven.
[1144.32 --> 1146.34]  I'm broken.
[1146.34 --> 1148.06]  God, I will know.
[1148.34 --> 1151.34]  Your spirit is within me.
[1152.34 --> 1157.42]  Because you died and rose again.
[1161.00 --> 1167.34]  Amazing love, how amazing me.
[1168.86 --> 1172.74]  And you, my king, will die for a sheep.
[1176.34 --> 1182.24]  It's amazing love, how awesome a sheep.
[1184.20 --> 1188.04]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1191.04 --> 1197.04]  It's amazing love, how heavy me.
[1199.58 --> 1203.42]  And you, my king, will die for a sheep.
[1203.42 --> 1211.32]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1211.32 --> 1213.32]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1213.32 --> 1223.22]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1223.22 --> 1231.12]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1231.12 --> 1235.02]  And you are my king.
[1235.02 --> 1242.92]  And you are my king.
[1242.92 --> 1250.82]  And you are my king.
[1250.82 --> 1258.72]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1258.72 --> 1266.62]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1266.62 --> 1268.52]  It's amazing love, how amazing me.
[1268.52 --> 1270.52]  And you are my king.
[1270.52 --> 1272.52]  And you are my king.
[1272.52 --> 1274.52]  And you are my king.
[1274.52 --> 1276.42]  And you are my king.
[1276.42 --> 1278.42]  And you are my king.
[1278.42 --> 1279.32]  And you are my king.
[1279.32 --> 1281.32]  And you are my king.
[1281.32 --> 1290.20]  the
[1297.24 --> 1308.20]  in oh
[1311.32 --> 1323.90]  So on this day of Thanksgiving,
[1324.90 --> 1328.68]  we remember that God is the giver of all things.
[1329.36 --> 1333.80]  And we especially remember that God gave his son,
[1333.92 --> 1335.32]  our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1335.32 --> 1338.44]  who lived and died and who lives again.
[1338.44 --> 1341.98]  And he gave him for our salvation.
[1343.38 --> 1346.14]  And so as we come to this meal this morning,
[1346.28 --> 1349.66]  this meal is for believers in the Lord Jesus,
[1349.80 --> 1352.58]  those who have put their trust and their faith
[1352.58 --> 1355.16]  in what he has done for us on the cross.
[1355.46 --> 1357.36]  So if that is your faith,
[1357.48 --> 1361.96]  then Jesus invites you and he welcomes you to feed on him,
[1362.40 --> 1364.04]  his broken body, his shed blood,
[1364.50 --> 1366.48]  and to do so by faith and with thanksgiving.
[1366.48 --> 1370.16]  If you have not yet this morning put your trust in Christ,
[1370.36 --> 1372.44]  then this meal is not yet for you,
[1372.56 --> 1375.12]  but we are so glad that you are here.
[1375.82 --> 1381.42]  And I invite you to use this time to receive Christ himself,
[1381.88 --> 1383.84]  to receive him by faith.
[1384.98 --> 1387.60]  And so let's come in prayer
[1387.60 --> 1391.32]  as we prepare you to celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[1391.44 --> 1392.02]  Let's pray together.
[1392.02 --> 1395.64]  Father, we do not presume to come to your table,
[1395.94 --> 1396.88]  O merciful Lord,
[1397.60 --> 1399.26]  trusting in our own righteousness,
[1400.28 --> 1404.20]  but in your abundant and great mercies.
[1405.04 --> 1408.12]  Lord, we are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs
[1408.12 --> 1409.30]  under your table,
[1410.04 --> 1414.52]  but you are the Lord whose character is always to have mercy.
[1414.52 --> 1419.16]  O Lord, we thank you for the cross of Jesus Christ,
[1419.90 --> 1424.26]  where we see the accomplishment of our salvation,
[1424.92 --> 1427.60]  the forgiveness of our sins,
[1428.24 --> 1432.12]  and the promise that we may forever dwell in you
[1432.12 --> 1433.38]  and you in us.
[1434.26 --> 1437.32]  Thank you that you gave your life for us
[1437.32 --> 1439.38]  so that we might live with you
[1439.38 --> 1441.86]  and live for you today and always.
[1441.86 --> 1443.80]  In Christ's name we pray.
[1444.22 --> 1444.62]  Amen.
[1446.52 --> 1447.48]  Brothers and sisters,
[1447.64 --> 1448.22]  the Lord Jesus,
[1448.38 --> 1449.72]  on the night when he was betrayed,
[1450.28 --> 1451.34]  he took bread,
[1451.84 --> 1452.94]  and when he had given thanks,
[1453.00 --> 1454.04]  he broke it and said,
[1454.16 --> 1455.18]  this is my body,
[1455.44 --> 1456.44]  which is for you.
[1457.26 --> 1459.62]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1460.54 --> 1461.40]  In the same way,
[1461.48 --> 1462.00]  after supper,
[1462.10 --> 1462.92]  he took the cup,
[1463.02 --> 1463.36]  saying,
[1463.50 --> 1466.44]  this cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[1467.04 --> 1468.36]  Whenever you drink it,
[1468.96 --> 1470.52]  do it in remembrance of me.
[1470.52 --> 1473.70]  For as often as you eat this bread
[1473.70 --> 1474.72]  and drink this cup,
[1475.04 --> 1476.54]  you proclaim the Lord's death
[1476.54 --> 1479.42]  until he comes again.
[1480.54 --> 1484.62]  So let's say the words of our communion liturgy together.
[1485.62 --> 1486.68]  Brothers and sisters,
[1486.88 --> 1487.76]  lift up your hearts.
[1488.56 --> 1492.70]  We are his people.
[1492.70 --> 1494.70]  We are our people.
[1494.70 --> 1494.72]  We are our people.
[1494.72 --> 1494.78]  We are our people.
[1494.78 --> 1494.80]  We are our people.
[1494.80 --> 1494.86]  We are our people.
[1494.86 --> 1495.70]  We are our people.
[1495.98 --> 1498.76]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1499.62 --> 1500.66]  Christ has died.
[1501.16 --> 1502.16]  Christ is risen.
[1502.78 --> 1504.18]  Christ will come again.
[1505.18 --> 1506.28]  Christ, our Passover,
[1506.66 --> 1508.52]  has been sacrificed for us.
[1508.98 --> 1509.34]  Hallelujah.
[1510.20 --> 1510.64]  Hallelujah.
[1511.18 --> 1512.12]  Brothers and sisters,
[1512.26 --> 1513.72]  these are the gifts of God
[1513.72 --> 1515.54]  for the people of God.
[1516.10 --> 1517.72]  Take them in remembrance
[1517.72 --> 1519.00]  that Christ died for you.
[1519.64 --> 1521.74]  Feed on him in your hearts
[1521.74 --> 1524.38]  by faith and with thanksgiving.
[1525.14 --> 1527.58]  So may I ask our elders and deacons
[1527.58 --> 1529.02]  who are serving to come forward
[1529.02 --> 1530.64]  and help me distribute the elements.
[1530.64 --> 1531.04]  Yeah.
[1531.04 --> 1531.08]  Yeah.
[1531.08 --> 1533.20]  Yeah.
[1533.20 --> 1533.26]  Yeah.
[1533.26 --> 1533.32]  Yeah.
[1533.32 --> 1535.32]  Yeah.
[1535.32 --> 1537.32]  Yeah.
[1537.32 --> 1538.32]  Yeah.
[1538.32 --> 1539.32]  Yeah.
[1539.32 --> 1541.32]  Yeah.
[1541.32 --> 1542.32]  Yeah.
[1542.32 --> 1543.32]  Yeah.
[1543.32 --> 1544.32]  Yeah.
[1544.32 --> 1545.32]  Yeah.
[1545.32 --> 1546.32]  Yeah.
[1546.32 --> 1547.32]  Yeah.
[1547.32 --> 1548.32]  Yeah.
[1548.32 --> 1548.98]  Yeah.
[1548.98 --> 1553.44]  Yeah.
[1553.44 --> 1554.30]  Yeah.
[1576.36 --> 1576.90]  Yeah.
[1576.90 --> 1578.90]  Amen.
[1606.90 --> 1608.90]  Amen.
[1636.90 --> 1638.90]  Amen.
[1666.90 --> 1668.90]  Amen.
[1696.90 --> 1698.90]  Amen.
[1726.90 --> 1728.90]  Amen.
[1756.90 --> 1758.90]  Amen.
[1760.90 --> 1767.04]  Sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken for us.
[1767.44 --> 1767.98]  Let's eat together.
[1786.90 --> 1788.90]  Amen.
[1816.90 --> 1818.90]  Amen.
[1846.90 --> 1848.90]  Amen.
[1876.90 --> 1878.90]  Amen.
[1906.90 --> 1908.90]  Amen.
[1936.90 --> 1938.90]  Amen.
[1966.90 --> 1968.88]  Amen.
[1988.24 --> 1996.42]  Brothers and sisters in Christ, take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus was shed for the remission of all of our sins.
[1996.42 --> 1997.40]  Let's drink together.
[2009.92 --> 2011.40]  Please join me in prayer.
[2012.78 --> 2018.96]  Almighty, everlasting God, we thank you for feeding us in these holy mysteries
[2018.96 --> 2027.12]  with a spiritual food of the most precious blood and body of your Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ,
[2027.58 --> 2033.42]  for assuring us through this sacrament of your favor and your goodness towards us,
[2033.56 --> 2037.00]  that we are true members of your mystical body,
[2037.84 --> 2041.22]  the blessed company of all your faithful people,
[2041.62 --> 2045.16]  and heirs through hope of your everlasting kingdom.
[2045.16 --> 2050.30]  We humbly ask you, Heavenly Father, to assist us with your grace,
[2050.88 --> 2053.90]  that we may continue in that holy fellowship,
[2054.36 --> 2058.54]  and to do all the good works that you have prepared for us to walk in.
[2059.12 --> 2064.10]  Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, to whom and with you in the Holy Spirit
[2064.10 --> 2068.88]  be all honor and glory, now and forever. Amen.
[2068.88 --> 2077.78]  So at this time, I would like to invite anyone who brought food
[2077.78 --> 2080.88]  for the donations to the food bank to...
[2081.70 --> 2084.42]  I know some are already here, but go ahead and bring those up.
[2084.68 --> 2087.98]  Maybe kids, if you want to do that job, you can,
[2088.22 --> 2090.02]  and bring them up here to the front.
[2090.98 --> 2094.24]  Then the children can also join me for our children's message.
[2094.24 --> 2124.22]  Thank you.
[2124.24 --> 2153.24]  .
[2153.24 --> 2168.54]  Hello? Hello? You guys move over here. Thank you. Hey. You're sitting right here. Good.
[2173.88 --> 2178.86]  Right. Nice to see you. Yeah, have a seat anywhere. It doesn't matter. Here, you can sit here.
[2178.86 --> 2187.14]  Okay, that works. All right, so you know what? I brought you a present this morning.
[2188.66 --> 2192.08]  Okay, these are all a little bit different. I'm just going to reach in and grab one. Okay,
[2192.12 --> 2203.72]  each one is special. There you go. There you go. These are real. This is a decorative gourd.
[2203.72 --> 2211.44]  Can you all say decorative gourd? What does that mean? That's what it is. It's a gourd.
[2211.88 --> 2224.14]  This grew from the ground. Yeah. Okay, so these are a way to decorate for Thanksgiving.
[2225.20 --> 2231.30]  Right? It's Thanksgiving. Do you all know that? It's Thanksgiving, and that's the holiday when we
[2231.30 --> 2236.96]  give thanks to God for all that he gives us, and these grew right from the ground, and I wanted to
[2236.96 --> 2245.90]  give you one to help you remember a Bible verse. I love this verse from Isaiah 55. Okay, you know what?
[2246.00 --> 2253.00]  And if you all want to memorize some of the Bible, I recommend memorizing Isaiah 55. It's a really great
[2253.00 --> 2261.00]  chapter. So I am going to read. Can you all listen? I want to read a verse. Use your image. And picture,
[2261.66 --> 2270.40]  picture what I'm going to say. As the rain and snow come down from heaven. Can you imagine that? Rain is
[2270.40 --> 2277.68]  raining, or it's snowing. And what does this rain and snow do? It comes down from heaven. It does not
[2277.68 --> 2284.02]  return without first watering the earth. And as the rain and snow, they water the earth. What does that do?
[2284.92 --> 2292.66]  It makes it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower, for the farmer, to put seeds in the
[2292.66 --> 2302.46]  field. And it gives bread for the eater. Are you an eater? Do you like to eat bread? Who likes to eat bread?
[2302.46 --> 2312.46]  Do you all like to eat bread? Yeah. You like to eat bread too? Hello, Gracie. So, yeah, you know what? And so God
[2312.46 --> 2322.24]  sends the rain, and the rain causes the ground to sprout with plants and things like these gourds. Now, these are not
[2322.24 --> 2329.54]  for eating, but they look pretty. So I want you to take and to remember that all things that grow in the world
[2329.54 --> 2335.60]  come from God come from God. And God is the great gardener who makes all of these things grow for us
[2335.60 --> 2342.76]  to eat. Okay? So when you enjoy a meal later today, I want you to be able to say thank you to who?
[2343.80 --> 2350.46]  To God, right? To God who gave us all things. All right? So let me, let's pray and give thanks to God
[2350.46 --> 2359.20]  together. Lord, we thank you that you are the God who created the world and everything in it,
[2359.54 --> 2368.04]  you made us, Lord, to be in your image and to reflect your glory back to you in gratitude. So,
[2368.12 --> 2372.56]  Lord, as we enjoy the many good things that you give us, help us to be thankful to you.
[2372.82 --> 2380.00]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. All right. Thanks. Go ahead. Back to your class.
[2380.00 --> 2384.38]  Oh, here.
[2384.38 --> 2384.96]  Oops.
[2384.96 --> 2414.94]  Thank you.
[2414.96 --> 2444.94]  Thank you.
[2444.96 --> 2446.96]  Thank you.
[2474.96 --> 2476.96]  Thank you.
[2504.96 --> 2534.96] 
[2534.96 --> 2536.96]  Thank you.
[2536.96 --> 2538.96]  Thank you.
[2538.96 --> 2568.96] 
[2568.96 --> 2570.96]  Thank you.
[2571.76 --> 2573.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2573.26 --> 2575.26]  Thank you.
[2575.26 --> 2576.26]  Thank you.
[2576.26 --> 2580.50]  So join me in prayer as we prepare to hear God's word this morning.
[2580.50 --> 2587.76]  Heavenly Father, as we open your word together this morning, please reveal yourself to us.
[2588.50 --> 2594.58]  Would you crack open our hard hearts by the working of your Holy Spirit and make them
[2594.58 --> 2599.76]  into softened hearts that we may know you and your son Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
[2600.22 --> 2601.56]  We pray in his name.
[2601.88 --> 2602.22]  Amen.
[2602.22 --> 2609.34]  So earlier this week, I think it was like Wednesday, we, in Richmond at least, we experienced a
[2609.34 --> 2611.22]  huge rainstorm.
[2611.72 --> 2613.08]  Did you all have this here in Delta?
[2614.08 --> 2614.54]  Yeah.
[2614.74 --> 2619.94]  So often in the winter here in the lower mainland, it kind of rains.
[2620.40 --> 2621.92]  It's just kind of always rainy a lot.
[2621.92 --> 2625.10]  But this was a downpour.
[2625.60 --> 2627.12]  Like the skies opened up.
[2627.20 --> 2628.10]  The skies darkened.
[2628.42 --> 2630.32]  The rain came flooding down.
[2630.68 --> 2631.46]  It was loud.
[2632.02 --> 2635.48]  It was, you know, it was so unusual that it got all of our attention.
[2635.62 --> 2637.92]  We go out and we just look at this rain coming down.
[2638.66 --> 2642.10]  And then very soon afterwards, there's a rainbow.
[2642.30 --> 2643.08]  Did you all see the rainbow?
[2644.48 --> 2645.54]  Maybe some of you did.
[2645.64 --> 2652.64]  We had this, well, okay, it's really hard to see on our screen, but this huge, bright,
[2652.82 --> 2658.28]  brilliant rainbow, all the colors, a double rainbow, in fact, from sky to sky, you know,
[2658.32 --> 2659.82]  from one end to the other.
[2660.82 --> 2665.90]  And it was so amazing that people were going through the neighborhood, pulling over and getting
[2665.90 --> 2670.76]  out to take pictures because it was such an incredible sight to see this.
[2671.84 --> 2676.26]  And it reminded me of what C.S. Lewis says about beauty.
[2677.10 --> 2678.06]  He said this.
[2678.48 --> 2684.12]  He said, seeing something beautiful is like admiring a sunbeam.
[2685.40 --> 2687.44]  You know, a sunbeam is a beautiful thing.
[2687.44 --> 2693.00]  The way it streams, you know, through a window and you see all those dust particles, you know,
[2693.08 --> 2693.88]  dancing in it.
[2693.88 --> 2701.68]  But he said for the Christian, we understand that we can both admire the sunbeam, but also
[2701.68 --> 2709.44]  that we trace our eye along it back to the source, back to the sun.
[2710.28 --> 2715.90]  And what he meant by that is that we can enjoy the beauty that we see all around us in nature,
[2716.00 --> 2719.66]  whether it's the mountains or a rainbow or even a rainstorm.
[2719.66 --> 2723.32]  But we also remember the source of that beauty.
[2724.44 --> 2726.12]  Where did it all come from?
[2726.92 --> 2729.34]  And the answer is it comes from God.
[2730.56 --> 2737.62]  And so the joys, the beauty that we find in creation and that we find in one another,
[2737.74 --> 2744.66]  in humanity, you know, in all that humanity creates and discovers, right?
[2744.66 --> 2752.20]  The arts, the sciences, all of the rest, these are sunbeams to marvel at, but they also lead
[2752.20 --> 2759.44]  our eyes back to the source so that we might then give thanks and praise to a joyful and creative
[2759.44 --> 2760.94]  and loving God.
[2760.94 --> 2770.16]  But I want to pause for a moment and I want us to consider that it's not easy to give thanks.
[2771.16 --> 2779.90]  It's not easy in our day or in our generation to look at something like a rainbow or a sunset
[2779.90 --> 2785.98]  or even a table laden with a Thanksgiving meal and to give thanks to God.
[2787.26 --> 2791.22]  To acknowledge God as the source of all the goodness that we experience in the world.
[2791.30 --> 2792.44]  It's not easy for us today.
[2793.30 --> 2795.62]  Well, maybe you're a Christian here this morning.
[2795.80 --> 2801.10]  Maybe you have been for a long time and you've developed the habit, the spiritual practice
[2801.10 --> 2803.62]  of giving thanks to God, right?
[2803.66 --> 2806.80]  You know that God is the source of all things and you give thanks to him.
[2807.38 --> 2809.30]  But it's not something that we do naturally.
[2809.30 --> 2817.30]  It's not something that we do because as human beings, for one, you know, we are burdened
[2817.94 --> 2818.90]  with the curse of sin.
[2819.06 --> 2823.24]  We are tainted by sin and because of that we don't give thanks.
[2823.34 --> 2825.94]  And so Ignatius is one of the early church fathers.
[2826.38 --> 2831.40]  He said that the root of all sin is ingratitude.
[2832.50 --> 2834.82]  It kind of makes sense, right?
[2834.82 --> 2840.20]  It's seizing life as a right rather than receiving it as a gift from God.
[2840.42 --> 2843.84]  So the root of all sin is actually ingratitude.
[2844.82 --> 2848.66]  So that's one reason why it's hard for us to give thanks to God just because of our sin.
[2849.54 --> 2854.16]  But there's another reason why gratitude is perhaps especially difficult in our day.
[2854.16 --> 2861.48]  And that is because of a major worldview shift that happened in the 18th century called the
[2861.48 --> 2861.92]  enlightenment.
[2862.80 --> 2867.54]  I want to talk about this for a minute because I think it will be helpful to you.
[2868.00 --> 2873.38]  If you're not interested in the enlightenment, you may snooze for about a minute or two and
[2873.38 --> 2874.28]  I'll tell you when it's over.
[2874.28 --> 2875.52]  Okay.
[2876.18 --> 2876.98]  The enlightenment.
[2877.36 --> 2882.48]  Basically, it said we, human beings, have the light of human reason.
[2883.14 --> 2891.92]  We can learn the truth, the true nature about how the world works, how the world really is,
[2891.92 --> 2899.98]  and we don't need religious tradition or religious authority or dogma telling us what to believe.
[2899.98 --> 2900.34]  Okay.
[2902.12 --> 2908.46]  If you were living a couple hundred years ago before the enlightenment, it would have been
[2908.46 --> 2911.28]  virtually impossible for you to not believe in God.
[2912.42 --> 2913.02]  Right?
[2913.06 --> 2920.32]  To not believe that this world had this sacred nature to it where God was actively involved
[2920.32 --> 2921.02]  in the world.
[2921.54 --> 2923.46]  Because everybody believed that.
[2923.52 --> 2924.58]  That was the worldview.
[2924.58 --> 2931.92]  It would have been like living in a house with lots of windows, with light streaming in
[2931.92 --> 2938.54]  from the outside world where our world was open to the divine, to God speaking to us, to
[2938.54 --> 2942.90]  angels, to God working in this world.
[2942.98 --> 2944.26]  That was the way it is.
[2945.10 --> 2949.18]  So when the sun came up in the morning, you would say, God made the sun rise.
[2949.18 --> 2953.86]  When the rain came down, you would say, God watered our crops.
[2953.96 --> 2954.94]  He answered our prayers.
[2955.68 --> 2959.66]  When plants grew up out of the ground, you would say, God fed us.
[2960.70 --> 2965.92]  But now with the age of enlightenment, this massive shift happened, which was this kind
[2965.92 --> 2968.12]  of secularizing of the world.
[2968.62 --> 2974.26]  This loss of the sacred order, the loss of a sense that it is God who makes the sun rise
[2974.26 --> 2979.68]  and who feeds us and gives us rain and gives us breath in life, where our lives are dependent
[2979.68 --> 2980.14]  on him.
[2981.18 --> 2985.28]  And so what the enlightenment did is if before we lived in a house with lots of windows and
[2985.28 --> 2990.00]  the light would kind of stream into the house, what the enlightenment did was slam down all
[2990.00 --> 2991.18]  the windows and draw the shade.
[2991.48 --> 2993.76]  There is nothing out there that we can know.
[2994.70 --> 3000.58]  And what our job, only thing we can know is to discover, is what we can discover by ourselves,
[3000.66 --> 3001.50]  by our own reason.
[3001.50 --> 3006.88]  And this worldview applied not only to God, like we can reason our way to God, maybe,
[3007.46 --> 3011.56]  but also to politics, to economics, to science, and all the rest.
[3012.94 --> 3019.14]  And this is the world we live in today, where the enlightenment has caused a sense of doubt
[3019.14 --> 3022.26]  and skepticism that we all feel.
[3022.86 --> 3025.16]  We all feel this, Christian and non-Christian alike.
[3025.16 --> 3032.64]  Even as Christian and non-Christian alike also feel that the world is sacred and that there
[3032.64 --> 3036.94]  is much more to the world and to reality than we can discover by our own senses.
[3038.16 --> 3041.78]  And of course, after the enlightenment, there were all kinds of other movements to push back
[3041.78 --> 3042.46]  against this.
[3042.54 --> 3044.38]  And because, you know, where's human freedom?
[3044.50 --> 3045.02]  Where's love?
[3045.08 --> 3045.74]  Where's creativity?
[3045.74 --> 3047.14]  And all these things.
[3047.30 --> 3050.86]  But to make a long story short, you can wake up now.
[3051.70 --> 3053.86]  This is why we need Psalm 65.
[3054.86 --> 3059.20]  Because it reminds us that we truly do live in a world that is sacred.
[3059.52 --> 3061.88]  We live in a world that is God's world.
[3062.56 --> 3067.54]  And that he is intimately and actively involved in the world that we live in.
[3067.54 --> 3075.08]  And so this Psalm 65, it teaches us also that the proper posture of how we are to live in
[3075.08 --> 3077.30]  the world is the posture of gratitude.
[3078.60 --> 3078.74]  Okay?
[3078.86 --> 3084.16]  When we know that everything does actually come from God, that God is actively involved,
[3084.48 --> 3090.44]  we trace the goodness back to the source and we respond in gratitude.
[3092.02 --> 3094.66]  So here's a bit of background about Psalm 65.
[3094.96 --> 3096.22]  It's written by King David.
[3096.22 --> 3098.50]  It is a psalm of thanksgiving.
[3099.58 --> 3106.50]  It was likely related to Israel's fall harvest in the observance of Yom Kippur, the Day of
[3106.50 --> 3107.00]  Atonement.
[3107.54 --> 3111.32]  And we think that because of the mention of the forgiveness of sins here in the worship
[3111.32 --> 3111.86]  at the temple.
[3113.12 --> 3119.28]  But Psalm 65 has three parts and each one gives us a reason to thank God.
[3119.78 --> 3125.26]  So we'll use that as our outline as we work through and look at Psalm 65 this morning.
[3125.26 --> 3127.10]  So here's the first point.
[3127.84 --> 3134.48]  The first reason that we today on this holiday and always can give thanks to God is for his
[3134.48 --> 3134.88]  grace.
[3135.66 --> 3135.76]  Okay?
[3136.40 --> 3137.50]  Reasons for gratitude.
[3137.88 --> 3139.20]  First is God's grace.
[3139.68 --> 3142.18]  So look with me again at verses one to four.
[3142.18 --> 3147.52]  Praise awaits you, O God, our God, in Zion.
[3148.14 --> 3149.94]  To you our vows will be fulfilled.
[3150.58 --> 3153.20]  You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.
[3154.14 --> 3157.62]  When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
[3158.36 --> 3162.10]  Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts.
[3162.38 --> 3166.54]  We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
[3166.54 --> 3172.94]  So in these first four verses, we have all of these words that relate to public worship.
[3173.72 --> 3173.96]  Right?
[3174.04 --> 3184.30]  The words that I noticed are praise, vows, prayer, forgave, bless, courts, house, temple.
[3184.76 --> 3187.76]  These are all words related to the public worship of God's people.
[3187.76 --> 3195.02]  But what I want to point out is that we largely conceive of worship as something that we do
[3195.02 --> 3195.70]  for God.
[3196.48 --> 3196.62]  Right?
[3196.64 --> 3197.44]  That's something that we do.
[3197.52 --> 3197.62]  Right?
[3197.72 --> 3201.62]  So this morning, I woke up and took a shower.
[3202.14 --> 3204.14]  I ate breakfast and had coffee.
[3204.46 --> 3205.72]  I drove to this building.
[3205.98 --> 3207.12]  I chat with people.
[3207.46 --> 3208.18]  I sing.
[3208.42 --> 3209.02]  I pray.
[3209.18 --> 3209.86]  I listen.
[3210.60 --> 3213.22]  I, you know, participate in communion.
[3213.22 --> 3217.90]  And worship feels a lot about things that I do.
[3218.76 --> 3218.94]  Right?
[3219.06 --> 3221.84]  I am offering to God what I can.
[3222.18 --> 3223.84]  And in a sense, that is true.
[3224.18 --> 3224.78]  We do that.
[3225.50 --> 3230.62]  But if we look carefully at the actions of worship in this psalm, we're going to find
[3230.62 --> 3231.42]  something curious.
[3232.22 --> 3239.50]  That they have a lot more to do with what God does for us and to us than what we do to
[3239.50 --> 3239.84]  God.
[3240.40 --> 3241.86]  So let me show you what I mean.
[3241.86 --> 3243.94]  Let's look first at verse 2.
[3245.54 --> 3247.78]  You know, David, he's here to worship.
[3247.94 --> 3249.06]  David wants to pray.
[3250.48 --> 3252.04]  How does he say it?
[3252.08 --> 3254.70]  He says, you who answer prayer.
[3255.88 --> 3256.82]  Is that interesting?
[3257.56 --> 3260.68]  So yes, when you pray, you speak words to God.
[3260.74 --> 3260.88]  Right?
[3260.90 --> 3261.82]  That's what prayer is.
[3262.10 --> 3268.46]  But David is saying the true action in prayer is the one who hears and answers prayer.
[3268.98 --> 3269.42]  Right?
[3269.42 --> 3271.70]  Not the one who says the prayer, who says the words.
[3271.86 --> 3273.88]  Verse 3.
[3275.08 --> 3277.96]  David talks about confessing his sin.
[3278.06 --> 3282.74]  He says, when we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave their transgressions.
[3282.74 --> 3286.58]  So is it important in worship to confess our sins?
[3286.58 --> 3287.94]  Of course it is.
[3287.94 --> 3294.04]  But the greater actor in confession is the one who hears and who forgives.
[3294.86 --> 3294.98]  Right?
[3295.06 --> 3299.22]  Who rescues us when we were overwhelmed by our sins.
[3299.22 --> 3301.82]  He frees us from our sins.
[3301.82 --> 3305.18]  You know, and that's the work of God that he does in our worship.
[3306.18 --> 3306.66]  Verse 4.
[3307.82 --> 3312.42]  Blessed are those you choose and you bring near to live in your courts.
[3312.42 --> 3317.96]  So it may be this morning that you walked with your own two feet or used the gas pedal and the brake.
[3319.58 --> 3321.72]  But who is welcoming the peoples?
[3322.52 --> 3329.56]  Who is opening his gates in his house and bringing the people near so that they can come in?
[3329.56 --> 3330.62]  It is God.
[3330.62 --> 3330.64]  It is God.
[3331.64 --> 3335.98]  And then still in verse 4, it says, we are filled with the good things of your house.
[3336.38 --> 3337.84]  Of your holy temple.
[3338.30 --> 3343.92]  So David says, the goodness of God's house, his temple, satisfies his people.
[3344.66 --> 3344.76]  Right?
[3344.76 --> 3351.78]  That God is richly providing, not just physically, but spiritually for all the people.
[3353.38 --> 3353.52]  Okay?
[3353.58 --> 3358.60]  So, you know, in these first four verses, David is just bursting with praise for God.
[3359.14 --> 3365.06]  But again and again, the psalm is saying, it is God who moves towards David at the same time.
[3365.58 --> 3367.52]  And indeed, towards all of us.
[3369.18 --> 3372.24]  And I also think it's important that this psalm begins with worship.
[3372.24 --> 3378.48]  Because, you know, as we're going to see as we move on, creation is also speaking about God as well.
[3378.86 --> 3379.00]  Right?
[3379.12 --> 3380.62]  Creation testifies to God.
[3381.20 --> 3389.86]  But the best place to learn about God and to experience God and to know God is with God's people.
[3390.84 --> 3393.36]  It's in the gathered worship of God's people.
[3393.44 --> 3393.60]  Right?
[3393.76 --> 3396.10]  So, it's not in a forest.
[3396.94 --> 3399.04]  It is not on a mountaintop.
[3399.04 --> 3401.12]  It is not in a desert.
[3402.24 --> 3407.36]  If you want to commune with God, the best place to do it is at church.
[3408.00 --> 3411.34]  Where God's people gather in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3412.06 --> 3418.48]  And through singing and praise and prayer and preaching and the Lord's Supper, we relate to God in that way.
[3419.04 --> 3424.90]  And it is God who acts in our worship, even as we give ourselves to him.
[3424.90 --> 3427.32]  So, that's the first part of the psalm.
[3427.38 --> 3429.82]  We're reminded that God is a forgiving God.
[3429.92 --> 3430.96]  He's a loving God.
[3431.12 --> 3433.88]  He's drawing people to himself to worship him.
[3434.56 --> 3435.82]  This is all God's grace.
[3436.52 --> 3442.50]  And I hope you can notice and hear that God's grace is a reason for gratitude.
[3442.50 --> 3451.24]  So, now the second reason for gratitude is not only God's grace, but the second one is God's deeds.
[3452.42 --> 3452.66]  Okay?
[3452.80 --> 3453.88]  God's deeds.
[3454.72 --> 3457.68]  So, let's look as we move on in verse 5.
[3458.16 --> 3458.74]  It says,
[3458.74 --> 3470.50]  So, when the psalmist says,
[3470.80 --> 3474.38]  What does that mean?
[3475.60 --> 3482.98]  Well, it means that God has done in the past and is doing currently deeds of righteousness.
[3483.26 --> 3484.26]  Works of righteousness.
[3485.32 --> 3486.68]  In other words, and what does that mean?
[3486.68 --> 3491.08]  What it means is, he is doing the business of righting wrongs.
[3491.70 --> 3491.86]  Okay?
[3491.92 --> 3493.44]  He is righting all wrongs.
[3494.00 --> 3499.54]  And we see this all throughout the Bible, that this is what God does as he is active in the world.
[3500.12 --> 3500.58]  Right?
[3500.64 --> 3506.78]  So, when things go wrong, right in the beginning, the Garden of Eden, the start of the world, sin and death enter the world,
[3507.26 --> 3511.90]  God is about the business of straightening out everything that has gone crooked.
[3511.90 --> 3521.04]  So, God calls Abraham, and then he calls Isaac and Jacob, and he forms a special people, and he blesses them.
[3521.52 --> 3532.10]  And the Israelites, the Jewish people, he gets them ready so that he could then do the ultimate deed of righteousness to send his son, Jesus Christ,
[3532.10 --> 3535.06]  who will come into our world and put everything right.
[3536.12 --> 3536.34]  Right?
[3536.42 --> 3538.50]  God is doing awesome deeds of righteousness.
[3539.06 --> 3542.54]  Ever since the beginning of the world, all the way to right now today.
[3543.68 --> 3548.48]  And we see that this work of God, these righteous deeds of God, is not only for God's people,
[3548.48 --> 3552.08]  but if you look at the rest of verse 5, it says,
[3552.28 --> 3557.26]  the hope of all the ends of the earth of the farthest seas.
[3559.20 --> 3560.30]  I love that.
[3560.78 --> 3561.34]  I love that.
[3561.96 --> 3572.24]  David barely knew about the Mediterranean Sea, let alone the Pacific, or the Atlantic, or the Arctic, or the Indian Seas,
[3572.34 --> 3575.44]  all of these peoples in all of these faraway lands.
[3575.44 --> 3575.76]  Right?
[3576.48 --> 3582.08]  But by the inspiration of the Spirit, he knows one day the message of God's awesome deeds,
[3582.80 --> 3588.24]  the gospel of our Lord Jesus, will go out to the furthest parts of all the earth.
[3590.24 --> 3596.56]  And then David begins to point to God's deeds, not only in history and through his people, but in all of creation.
[3597.22 --> 3600.66]  So, in verses 6 to 7, he says,
[3600.66 --> 3620.30]  It's a beautiful image.
[3620.30 --> 3627.96]  And so, God isn't just a God who made the mountains, the seas, the waves, and all the peoples of the world,
[3628.56 --> 3632.52]  but he also sovereignly controls them.
[3633.34 --> 3636.74]  He has his sovereign dominion over all that he made.
[3637.24 --> 3640.94]  He can calm the roaring seas and the towering waves.
[3641.26 --> 3644.22]  He can calm the unrest of the people.
[3644.22 --> 3651.20]  And when we read the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, this is exactly what we see Jesus doing.
[3651.96 --> 3653.58]  He calms the storms.
[3654.16 --> 3655.56]  And he calms hearts.
[3656.46 --> 3658.58]  He stills the waves.
[3658.96 --> 3661.08]  And he stills our souls.
[3662.44 --> 3667.86]  He's offering peace to everything that is unruly and unrestful.
[3667.86 --> 3668.76]  Right?
[3669.76 --> 3676.48]  Jesus is God who's come into our world in the most personal way, doing deeds of righteousness.
[3677.86 --> 3680.62]  And so, again, the point is highlighted, again, in verse 8.
[3681.98 --> 3689.98]  The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders, where morning dawns and evening fades, horizon to horizon, right?
[3690.10 --> 3692.62]  You call forth songs of joy.
[3692.62 --> 3698.60]  And so, the first part of this psalm is how we know and experience God in worship,
[3699.02 --> 3704.48]  which is the most direct way that we can know him, that he is a forgiving and loving and gracious God.
[3704.84 --> 3708.38]  The second part of the psalm points us to the God who is active in the world,
[3708.76 --> 3711.76]  who has created our world, who is actively governing the world,
[3712.12 --> 3716.44]  both the natural world and all the peoples and all the nations who live on it.
[3717.06 --> 3720.20]  The whole world is full of his awesome deeds.
[3720.20 --> 3729.04]  And by the way, to these ancient Israelites, we are the people at the ends of the earth.
[3729.78 --> 3729.90]  Right?
[3729.96 --> 3733.14]  We are the people across the farthest seas.
[3734.04 --> 3742.64]  And God, in his awesome deeds, has brought knowledge of his works and of who Jesus Christ is to us.
[3742.64 --> 3753.80]  God has shown his deeds that point to himself, to us, so that we can respond in gratitude, because they point to him.
[3755.16 --> 3759.24]  Okay, so that leads us to the third part of our psalm today.
[3759.94 --> 3763.24]  The third reason for gratitude that we see here.
[3763.24 --> 3775.06]  And what we see is a beautiful picture of the natural world that is under the care of God, that is under the blessing of God.
[3775.06 --> 3780.70]  So look at how this psalm speaks about God in verse 9.
[3782.94 --> 3783.30]  He says,
[3783.44 --> 3786.04]  You care for the land and water it.
[3786.70 --> 3788.32]  You enrich it abundantly.
[3788.48 --> 3795.44]  The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
[3796.62 --> 3799.16]  What is God being described like here?
[3799.16 --> 3803.08]  God is like a gardener.
[3803.60 --> 3804.06]  Right?
[3804.18 --> 3805.40]  I think that's such a cool image.
[3806.02 --> 3814.86]  God, like a skilled gardener going around with his watering can, making sure each plant has what it needs.
[3816.12 --> 3818.92]  Intimately caring for the land and watering it.
[3820.14 --> 3826.18]  And as God cares for the earth, David says, God enriches the earth.
[3826.18 --> 3827.10]  Right?
[3827.20 --> 3833.06]  And so we live in a world that is rich and abundant with life.
[3833.54 --> 3835.16]  With a life that God calls forth.
[3835.28 --> 3835.38]  Right?
[3835.42 --> 3838.58]  It resounds with a diversity of plants and animals.
[3838.82 --> 3841.00]  It is a rich world.
[3842.24 --> 3846.34]  Notice then in verse 9 that God provides grain for his people.
[3847.22 --> 3847.34]  Right?
[3847.38 --> 3849.54]  God makes plants that we can actually eat.
[3850.18 --> 3853.84]  Plants that give nutrients that help us to grow and thrive.
[3854.80 --> 3855.02]  Right?
[3855.02 --> 3862.08]  And so rye bread, sourdough bread, was in God's mind when he created the world.
[3862.86 --> 3866.70]  Along with wild blueberries and raspberries.
[3866.82 --> 3867.92]  Along with nori.
[3868.92 --> 3869.84]  You know what nori is?
[3870.74 --> 3871.72]  It's that seaweed, right?
[3871.78 --> 3875.40]  It's that kind of sweet, chewy seaweed that my kids love to pack for lunch.
[3876.46 --> 3876.88]  Right?
[3876.96 --> 3879.08]  God gave us a world of things that we can eat.
[3879.56 --> 3882.46]  And he provides it for us and he makes things grow.
[3882.46 --> 3884.74]  And then verse 10 says,
[3884.92 --> 3887.10]  You drench its furrows and level its ridges.
[3887.20 --> 3890.26]  You soften it with showers and bless its crops.
[3890.26 --> 3898.82]  So remember back in verse 7 we have this roaring of the seas and the waves that God has to calm and say to be still.
[3898.82 --> 3906.12]  And in contrast to that, here we have water that God is using to grow crops.
[3906.36 --> 3908.78]  That he's channeling and harnessing.
[3909.88 --> 3914.92]  So in this psalm we see that God has his own relationship with nature.
[3915.88 --> 3918.26]  God invests in his world.
[3918.76 --> 3920.04]  He cares for it.
[3920.04 --> 3921.92]  And it responds to him.
[3922.48 --> 3922.62]  Right?
[3922.70 --> 3923.56]  He waters it.
[3923.74 --> 3925.24]  And it grows green.
[3926.18 --> 3931.42]  God's caretaking inspires from nature this response.
[3931.78 --> 3932.00]  Right?
[3932.04 --> 3933.04]  Where he blesses it.
[3933.16 --> 3935.30]  And it responds by producing abundance.
[3936.28 --> 3938.06]  And you know, and we think about Jesus.
[3938.28 --> 3938.48]  Right?
[3938.72 --> 3944.80]  As Jesus in the world, God, he creates barrels and barrels of wine for a wedding.
[3944.80 --> 3949.54]  He multiplies fish and loaves of bread to feed the people.
[3950.10 --> 3950.20]  Right?
[3950.26 --> 3955.02]  The natural world responding to its creator in Jesus Christ.
[3957.00 --> 3960.38]  Verse 11 says this.
[3960.48 --> 3962.16]  You crown the year with your bounty.
[3962.70 --> 3962.76]  Right?
[3963.00 --> 3963.38]  Crown.
[3964.02 --> 3964.58]  It's beautiful.
[3964.76 --> 3965.94]  This resplendent thing.
[3967.16 --> 3970.60]  Your carts overflow with abundance.
[3971.78 --> 3971.96]  Right?
[3971.96 --> 3973.86]  This picture is God driving a cart.
[3974.80 --> 3978.64]  You know, like a farm cart loaded with all of these, this abundance.
[3978.98 --> 3980.88]  It's this load on the back of his cart.
[3981.16 --> 3987.96]  And as it trundles along, it keeps dropping treasures off the side because it is so abundant.
[3989.12 --> 3992.98]  It's a picture of God not being stingy with his gifts.
[3993.64 --> 3996.38]  But who lavishes his gifts upon us.
[3996.38 --> 4007.22]  Then in verses 12 and 13, the final verses of the psalm, there's this lovely picture of the fields and the meadows and the hills.
[4007.74 --> 4010.80]  It says, the grasslands of the wilderness overflow.
[4011.44 --> 4013.78]  The hills are clothed with gladness.
[4013.78 --> 4016.50]  Then verse 13.
[4016.50 --> 4018.76]  The meadows are covered with flocks.
[4019.04 --> 4021.28]  The valleys are mantled with grain.
[4021.42 --> 4023.36]  They shout for joy and sing.
[4023.90 --> 4024.06]  Right?
[4024.20 --> 4027.10]  So, this is the image of the meadows, of the fields.
[4027.22 --> 4027.34]  Right?
[4027.82 --> 4029.56]  Clothing themselves with animals.
[4029.80 --> 4029.94]  Right?
[4029.98 --> 4031.10]  Just getting decked out.
[4031.96 --> 4033.64]  It's such an interesting image.
[4034.14 --> 4036.64]  The valleys decked out with grain.
[4037.06 --> 4039.68]  The meadows dressed up in their finest.
[4039.68 --> 4043.76]  And then all of these places, they're singing.
[4044.02 --> 4045.10]  They're singing for joy.
[4045.44 --> 4046.72]  They're worshiping God.
[4047.78 --> 4048.10]  Why?
[4048.44 --> 4052.90]  Because their creator rejoices in them and he sustains them.
[4054.70 --> 4057.02]  So, what do you think about that image?
[4058.30 --> 4061.22]  This picture of nature actively engaged in worship.
[4061.74 --> 4063.24]  Do you think this is only a metaphor?
[4064.76 --> 4068.52]  Is this simply, you know, some fancy poetic language?
[4069.68 --> 4074.62]  Well, you know, in the gospel story of the triumphal entry,
[4075.36 --> 4078.52]  remember the people are praising Jesus as he comes into the city.
[4079.36 --> 4081.10]  The Pharisees want them to stop.
[4081.82 --> 4082.86]  And what does Jesus say?
[4083.88 --> 4089.54]  He says, I tell you, if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.
[4090.62 --> 4090.78]  Right?
[4091.22 --> 4094.50]  Even the rocks, Jesus says, will praise him.
[4094.50 --> 4102.82]  So, perhaps we can make a good theological case that nature itself actually does engage in worship.
[4103.50 --> 4103.92]  Right?
[4104.00 --> 4108.38]  When plants and animals that God has made, other aspects of the created world,
[4108.48 --> 4112.80]  when they fulfill their created purpose, they reflect glory back to God.
[4113.28 --> 4114.62]  And they do it so naturally.
[4115.48 --> 4121.92]  You know, like a tree, just being a tree, making its leaves, doing its thing, is glorifying God.
[4121.92 --> 4124.58]  Wouldn't it be nice to be a tree?
[4125.20 --> 4130.30]  Just to glorify God in that way.
[4131.38 --> 4135.86]  So, this summer, my family and I, we met a couple, a husband and a wife,
[4135.92 --> 4138.64]  and they have a big dog named Tilly.
[4139.14 --> 4139.96]  So, there's Tilly.
[4140.74 --> 4146.58]  So, this breed of dog is huge, and it is a type of shepherd dog.
[4146.58 --> 4155.48]  So, the couple got this dog from the original owners, who didn't want Tilly anymore because she was not a very good shepherd dog.
[4156.02 --> 4161.48]  She did not do a good job of protecting the sheep from cougars and wolves.
[4162.16 --> 4163.96]  So, they fired her.
[4165.26 --> 4167.92]  And so, this husband and wife, they adopted Tilly.
[4167.92 --> 4174.62]  And, but the thing is, God made Tilly to be a shepherd dog, to watch over the sheep.
[4174.74 --> 4181.08]  And so, what they did was they bought three sheep just so Tilly could have some sheep to watch over.
[4182.04 --> 4183.50]  So, the husband was pretty funny.
[4183.60 --> 4188.40]  He said, I had to buy pets for my pet, which is, like, really over the top.
[4188.58 --> 4192.36]  But, Tilly, she loves watching the sheep.
[4192.36 --> 4195.22]  And, and that's, that's a manageable number for her.
[4195.50 --> 4196.82]  She wasn't so good at the other ones.
[4196.92 --> 4200.30]  But, when they're in a pen and there's only three, she feels proud.
[4200.62 --> 4201.96]  She has a sense of purpose.
[4202.84 --> 4205.60]  Being a shepherd dog and watching the sheep is how God made her.
[4206.28 --> 4209.56]  And, she reflects that glory back to God.
[4210.80 --> 4213.86]  This also reminds me of this quote in the movie Chariots of Fire.
[4214.64 --> 4214.84]  Right?
[4214.90 --> 4218.34]  It tells a story of Eric Little, who was a runner in the Olympics.
[4218.34 --> 4220.40]  He was, then became a missionary to China.
[4220.40 --> 4220.44]  Yeah.
[4221.84 --> 4226.46]  Eric Little famously says this, I believe God made me for a purpose.
[4227.50 --> 4229.16]  He also made me fast.
[4229.90 --> 4232.84]  And, when I run, I feel his pleasure.
[4234.06 --> 4235.22]  It's a beautiful quote.
[4235.30 --> 4238.36]  When I run, I feel his pleasure.
[4239.46 --> 4246.30]  So, what if this kind of worshipful, this worshipful pleasure of fulfilling our purpose,
[4246.40 --> 4249.30]  of reflecting back to God the way he has made us,
[4249.30 --> 4251.36]  it's not just something that humans experience,
[4251.36 --> 4253.94]  but something that all nature engages in.
[4254.82 --> 4259.58]  But, actually, because we are a part of nature as human beings,
[4259.58 --> 4264.54]  we are invited to join the song of worship that all nature is singing.
[4264.54 --> 4267.44]  We are part of the world that God has made.
[4267.44 --> 4275.88]  And, one of the chief ways that we worship God and reflect glory back to God is through gratitude.
[4276.76 --> 4281.72]  Through acknowledging him, thanking him as the source of all things,
[4281.86 --> 4284.86]  receiving all things from his hands as a gift.
[4285.08 --> 4288.58]  That's how we can glorify God, through gratitude.
[4288.58 --> 4295.66]  You know, and I know in our culture, like I said, in our generation, it can feel like God is far away.
[4296.86 --> 4299.12]  He feels distant from us.
[4299.22 --> 4301.66]  He might feel distant from our political life.
[4302.94 --> 4308.38]  He feels distant from the world that we live in on our smartphones and devices.
[4309.38 --> 4311.50]  He feels distant from our cultural life.
[4311.50 --> 4318.42]  Life on earth can feel that way, but the Bible assures us, over and over again, he is not far away.
[4319.94 --> 4323.34]  God has given us the world with all of its bounty and beauty,
[4323.72 --> 4327.28]  and so that all of it will lead our eyes back to him.
[4328.04 --> 4331.66]  So that as men, women, and children, we might know Jesus Christ.
[4332.72 --> 4338.00]  And so, friends, it is to Jesus Christ that I invite you this morning.
[4338.00 --> 4342.18]  Whether it's for the first time you're here this morning in hearing about him,
[4342.30 --> 4346.96]  or whether it's for the thousandth, hundredth time.
[4348.80 --> 4349.24]  Okay?
[4349.64 --> 4354.14]  I invite you to receive Jesus as a gift and to give thanks to him.
[4354.96 --> 4355.86]  Let's pray together.
[4359.16 --> 4365.62]  God, we thank you for this psalm, which reminds us that there is so much more going on in the world
[4365.62 --> 4367.46]  than we often realize.
[4368.00 --> 4375.58]  And all of it is pointing beyond itself to a God who loves the people of the earth,
[4375.98 --> 4379.80]  who created this world for us, who sustains it,
[4380.22 --> 4386.26]  and who wants us to come to him, to know him, and to respond to him in gratitude.
[4387.16 --> 4388.60]  Help us to do so, we pray.
[4389.14 --> 4391.00]  In Jesus' name and for his sake.
[4391.72 --> 4392.04]  Amen.
[4392.04 --> 4399.68]  So let us respond in praise to God by standing and singing our song of response.
[4399.68 --> 4400.30]  Amen.
[4400.34 --> 4400.42]  Amen.
[4416.66 --> 4425.58]  Amen.
[4425.58 --> 4425.66]  Amen.
[4425.66 --> 4442.42]  For the beauty of the earth, for the glory of the skies,
[4442.42 --> 4452.18]  Lord of the world from our world, over and around us, God,
[4452.18 --> 4463.46]  Christ, our glory of the earth, His Son, in love, faithful grace.
[4464.24 --> 4473.54]  For the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the sky,
[4473.54 --> 4483.44]  Heal and firm and true and bold, sun and moon and stars of light,
[4484.10 --> 4493.54]  Christ, our love, to the living days, this our gift of grateful grace.
[4493.54 --> 4504.54]  For the perfect gift of life, to our ways so freely give,
[4505.54 --> 4514.54]  Faces, human and divine, Mars of earth and bonds of heaven.
[4514.54 --> 4525.94]  For the joy of the living days, his son in love, grateful grace.
[4525.94 --> 4536.70]  For the joy of the living days, where the sister parents show,
[4537.26 --> 4546.62]  Hands of heaven and friends of love, for our children are lost and found.
[4546.62 --> 4557.68]  Christ, our love, to the living days, this our gift of grateful grace.
[4557.68 --> 4587.66]  Christ, our love, to the living days, this our gift of grateful grace.
[4587.66 --> 4592.66]  Christ, our love, to the living days, this our gift of grace.
[4592.66 --> 4593.66]  Let me see.
[4593.66 --> 4594.20]  Let me see.
[4602.20 --> 4608.88]  So we respond to a gracious and caring creator God this morning
[4608.88 --> 4614.54]  by giving him the first fruits of all that he gives us.
[4614.54 --> 4620.84]  And I want to share a verse from 2 Corinthians 9, verses 10 to 11.
[4621.42 --> 4622.42]  This is what Paul writes.
[4622.42 --> 4631.00]  Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed
[4631.00 --> 4633.58]  and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
[4634.38 --> 4639.56]  You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion.
[4640.06 --> 4645.04]  And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
[4645.04 --> 4647.04]  So let's give.
[4647.04 --> 4647.40]  So let's give.
[4647.60 --> 4652.74]  And as we give, God promises that he will receive the thanks.
[4653.92 --> 4657.66]  Our designated offering today is for the South Delta Food Bank.
[4657.66 --> 4663.92]  And I would like to invite our deacons to come forward and pass the offering bags.
[4665.42 --> 4670.14]  Later on, during the music that we'll share, we'll invite you to sing along.

[5203.36 --> 5211.50]  Thank you, Lord, for your son, Jesus Christ, who lived and who died and who lives again for our salvation.
[5211.50 --> 5241.48]  Thank you, Lord, for the hope of God, thank you, Lord, for the hope of glory.
