[686.96 --> 688.96]  Thank you.
[688.96 --> 690.00]  front, you're food room,
[690.00 --> 690.96]  great, john, andêtre turkey,
[691.06 --> 693.96]  thank you, man, but I was roads in this young and the little town, Tell you.
[693.96 --> 696.76]  Your condemnation rejoices.
[697.78 --> 698.82]  You may be seated.
[701.64 --> 708.10]  We have a scripture from Isaiah 35 in the Old Testament that Haley will now read for us.
[710.24 --> 711.66]  Isaiah 35.
[712.44 --> 715.34]  The desert and the parched land will be glad.
[715.92 --> 719.28]  The wilderness will rejoice and blossom like a crocus.
[720.32 --> 722.66]  It will burst into bloom.
[722.66 --> 725.70]  It will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.
[726.44 --> 729.66]  The glory of Lebanon will be given into it.
[731.16 --> 733.54]  The splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
[734.04 --> 735.66]  They will see the glory of the Lord.
[736.22 --> 737.32]  The splendor of our God.
[738.40 --> 739.84]  Strengthen the feeble hands.
[740.48 --> 741.88]  Steady the knees that give way.
[743.14 --> 745.74]  Say those with fearful hearts.
[746.16 --> 747.60]  Be strong. Do not fear.
[748.08 --> 748.78]  Your God will come.
[749.70 --> 752.22]  He will come with vengeance.
[752.66 --> 753.76]  With divine retribution.
[754.38 --> 755.12]  He will save you.
[755.12 --> 759.84]  Then will the eyes of the blind be open.
[760.22 --> 762.00]  The ears of the deaf unstop.
[763.50 --> 765.96]  Then will the lame leap like a deer.
[766.66 --> 768.34]  The mute tongue shout for joy.
[769.50 --> 773.78]  Water will gush forth in the wilderness and stream in the desert.
[774.46 --> 776.36]  The burning sand will become a pool.
[776.36 --> 778.80]  The thirsty ground bubbling springs.
[778.80 --> 781.82]  In the haunts where jackals once laid.
[784.08 --> 788.28]  Grass where reeds and papyrus will grow.
[789.32 --> 791.24]  And a highway will be there.
[791.76 --> 793.26]  It will be called the way of holiness.
[793.26 --> 796.72]  It will be for those who walk on that way.
[796.72 --> 799.30]  The unclean will not journey on it.
[799.86 --> 803.52]  The wicked fools will not go on about it.
[804.06 --> 805.18]  No lion will be there.
[805.44 --> 806.58]  Nor any ravenous beast.
[807.42 --> 808.90]  They will not be found there.
[809.20 --> 812.10]  But only the redeemed will walk there.
[813.44 --> 815.88]  And those the Lord has rescued will return.
[815.88 --> 818.80]  They will enter Zion singing.
[820.00 --> 822.88]  Everlasting joy will crown their head.
[823.44 --> 825.20]  Gladness and joy will overtake them.
[825.84 --> 827.38]  And sorrow and singing will flee away.
[827.88 --> 829.12]  This is the word of the Lord.
[830.10 --> 831.00]  Thanks be to God.
[833.28 --> 837.94]  I'd like to invite any children that are with us to come up.
[840.72 --> 843.16]  Do we have any kids here this morning?
[843.52 --> 843.82]  Come.
[845.88 --> 848.12]  Please come.
[848.22 --> 849.46]  We need you this morning.
[850.04 --> 850.72]  Come on up.
[853.34 --> 854.16]  Come on up.
[854.40 --> 856.08]  I have a story for you.
[859.98 --> 860.74]  Oh good.
[860.84 --> 861.74]  Come and sit down.
[862.50 --> 863.22]  Thank you.
[863.58 --> 864.56]  Thank you for coming.
[864.74 --> 865.26]  Good morning.
[867.10 --> 869.18]  I have a question for you this morning.
[869.86 --> 871.88]  Have any of you ever been to a parade?
[873.76 --> 874.22]  Yeah?
[874.22 --> 876.26]  Parades are fun.
[876.38 --> 877.52]  What did you see in the parade?
[879.52 --> 881.70]  What kind of things came by in the parade?
[883.86 --> 884.88]  Lots of people.
[886.02 --> 886.76]  That's true.
[887.04 --> 888.34]  Sometimes horses.
[889.46 --> 890.70]  Maybe some motorcycles.
[891.56 --> 892.98]  Maybe some fancy cars.
[893.66 --> 894.60]  Maybe a band.
[894.60 --> 897.16]  Do you ever see a band in a parade?
[897.16 --> 899.96]  Parades are usually pretty long, aren't they?
[900.08 --> 901.64]  There's a lot of things in a parade.
[902.74 --> 908.00]  Well, a long time ago in a faraway place there was also a parade.
[908.80 --> 910.46]  But it wasn't a very big parade.
[910.80 --> 912.10]  There were some men in the parade.
[912.10 --> 915.18]  And there was somebody very special in this parade.
[915.32 --> 916.34]  Do you know who it was?
[917.60 --> 918.48]  Good answer.
[918.66 --> 919.66]  It was Jesus.
[920.52 --> 923.48]  It was Jesus coming into Jerusalem.
[923.72 --> 925.14]  They were having a big feast there.
[925.22 --> 926.86]  And there were many people in Jerusalem.
[927.14 --> 928.88]  And they heard that Jesus was coming.
[928.88 --> 934.70]  And they knew that Jesus had done so many wonderful things for people.
[935.22 --> 937.38]  What were some of the things that Jesus did for people?
[938.58 --> 939.76]  He healed them.
[940.54 --> 942.46]  Monica, you were going to say something?
[942.66 --> 943.54]  He healed them.
[944.44 --> 945.02]  What else?
[945.46 --> 947.48]  Do you remember the story about food?
[948.44 --> 948.66]  Yeah?
[949.70 --> 951.62]  He helped them in a lot of ways.
[951.80 --> 951.94]  Yeah?
[951.94 --> 954.68]  He fed them with just a few things.
[954.78 --> 955.94]  He fed a whole big crowd.
[956.52 --> 959.84]  And he had did things that nobody else ever did.
[960.36 --> 961.66]  And do you know what we call those?
[963.18 --> 963.66]  Miracles.
[963.86 --> 964.70]  Jesus did miracles.
[964.94 --> 967.38]  And so the people heard they were coming and they wanted to see him.
[967.38 --> 970.78]  So they all crowded to the road where they knew he was coming.
[971.60 --> 974.08]  And they brought palm branches.
[974.92 --> 978.36]  Palm branches that mean, Lord, save us.
[978.90 --> 979.08]  Right?
[979.20 --> 981.64]  And they waved palm branches to welcome him.
[982.48 --> 984.38]  But you know, Jesus came when he rode.
[984.82 --> 985.30]  He came.
[985.50 --> 987.44]  They all went and they were looking.
[987.80 --> 988.68]  And they were waiting for him.
[988.70 --> 989.78]  And they craned their necks.
[989.96 --> 990.60]  They stretched.
[991.04 --> 992.04]  Can you stretch your necks?
[992.14 --> 993.72]  They were looking for Jesus.
[994.16 --> 1000.86]  And finally in the distance, they see somebody riding a donkey.
[1003.02 --> 1003.38]  What?
[1004.30 --> 1004.82]  Jesus?
[1005.74 --> 1008.94]  Jesus, the one who was the king, he's riding a donkey?
[1008.94 --> 1012.22]  Why not a big horse?
[1012.72 --> 1014.18]  Like somebody in battle.
[1014.36 --> 1016.26]  He had come to save them, didn't he?
[1017.22 --> 1021.12]  Well, the people expected Jesus to come save them from their troubles.
[1021.12 --> 1024.30]  But he had a way bigger plan.
[1024.62 --> 1026.76]  He was coming to save the whole world.
[1026.98 --> 1028.26]  Not just them.
[1028.94 --> 1034.60]  And he rode a donkey because he was showing that he was a peaceful king.
[1034.74 --> 1036.20]  Not a fighting king.
[1036.72 --> 1038.20]  He was a peaceful king.
[1038.20 --> 1044.42]  So, they knew that it was Jesus.
[1044.58 --> 1046.44]  The people cheered and they ran alongside.
[1046.70 --> 1048.44]  And lots of kids, just like you, were there too.
[1048.68 --> 1049.70]  Waving their palm branches.
[1049.70 --> 1057.12]  This coming week, between Palm Sunday and Easter, is called Holy Week.
[1058.28 --> 1063.28]  And so, I hope that this week, we can think and talk about all the things,
[1063.40 --> 1065.54]  the special things that happened during that week.
[1066.00 --> 1067.60]  And talk about them at home.
[1068.84 --> 1072.24]  And about the greatest miracle that Jesus loves us.
[1072.52 --> 1077.48]  And came not to fight, but to take away our sins and to bring us peace.
[1077.48 --> 1079.54]  Can we pray about that?
[1081.32 --> 1082.66]  Dear Lord, thank you.
[1082.78 --> 1084.00]  Thank you for Holy Week.
[1084.20 --> 1086.14]  Thank you for the greatest story ever.
[1086.32 --> 1087.26]  That you love us.
[1087.62 --> 1090.90]  And that you came as a Prince of Peace to take away our sins.
[1091.58 --> 1094.46]  Will you help us this week to think about that?
[1095.48 --> 1098.26]  And Lord, may we love you more each day.
[1098.64 --> 1098.94]  Amen.
[1100.34 --> 1104.52]  I am going to ask you, before you go, to help us sing the next song.
[1104.64 --> 1106.70]  I'm going to give you palm branches to wave.
[1106.70 --> 1108.84]  I'm going to ask you to stand across here.
[1109.06 --> 1112.64]  And I want you to wave the palm branches as we sing Hosanna.
[1112.78 --> 1113.52]  Can you do that?
[1113.98 --> 1118.40]  And then on the last verse, your teachers will lead you out with your palm branches.
[1118.54 --> 1118.80]  Okay?
[1120.08 --> 1120.52]  Okay.
[1120.78 --> 1120.96]  Come.
[1121.20 --> 1122.36]  Come stand along here.
[1122.42 --> 1124.34]  All the way across the front, I'm going to give you branches.
[1126.64 --> 1127.40]  Spread out.
[1127.78 --> 1128.34]  Spread out.
[1128.68 --> 1129.30]  Spread out.
[1130.42 --> 1132.98]  Oh, April, do you mind just standing down here with Ezra?
[1133.04 --> 1133.92]  I think he wants you.
[1133.92 --> 1136.88]  You just stand over here with him.
[1137.10 --> 1138.86]  You can still sing with us.
[1138.90 --> 1139.94]  You have a very loud voice.
[1141.46 --> 1142.66]  Ezra, you want to stand with April?
[1143.00 --> 1143.82]  Oh, yeah, you can do that.
[1143.86 --> 1144.46]  She can do that.
[1144.56 --> 1145.04]  That's fine.
[1145.32 --> 1147.50]  As long as she's not too close to the...
[1147.50 --> 1150.42]  You have to be careful you don't point it to the monitor or get squeaky squawks.
[1150.78 --> 1151.94]  Ezra, here you go.
[1153.02 --> 1154.40]  Yeah, that's yours then.
[1154.66 --> 1155.54]  You take that one.
[1155.54 --> 1159.14]  Can you guys come over here a little bit more?
[1159.20 --> 1162.22]  Let's spread out a little bit because if you're waving palm branches, we don't want to hit each other.
[1162.56 --> 1167.42]  I know you've got your little corner and I've got mine, but, you know, we need to spread out a little bit.
[1167.52 --> 1167.84]  Right?
[1169.98 --> 1171.60]  Let's see if we can give you a bit bigger one.
[1171.84 --> 1172.62]  There you go.
[1174.46 --> 1174.78]  Perfect.
[1175.60 --> 1175.96]  Okay.
[1176.52 --> 1179.12]  Everybody stand, please, and we're going to sing Hosanna.
[1179.12 --> 1179.16]  Hosanna.
[1180.24 --> 1181.46]  Lord, save us.
[1185.22 --> 1191.42]  Oh, you know, if you guys can stand one step higher so everybody can see you and raise your branches really high.
[1191.58 --> 1194.28]  If you want to step on the first, stand up here a little bit more.
[1194.52 --> 1195.48]  You can come and stand up.
[1196.66 --> 1196.98]  No.
[1197.32 --> 1198.06]  Yes, no.
[1198.06 --> 1198.12]  No.
[1198.12 --> 1198.18]  No.
[1198.18 --> 1198.22]  No.
[1198.22 --> 1198.24]  No.
[1198.24 --> 1198.26]  No.
[1198.26 --> 1198.30]  No.
[1198.30 --> 1200.18]  No.
[1200.18 --> 1200.26]  No.
[1200.26 --> 1202.26]  No.
[1202.26 --> 1202.30]  No.
[1202.30 --> 1202.34]  No.
[1202.34 --> 1204.30]  No.
[1204.30 --> 1206.30]  No.
[1206.30 --> 1206.34]  No.
[1206.34 --> 1207.30]  No.
[1207.30 --> 1208.30]  No.
[1208.30 --> 1208.34]  No.
[1208.34 --> 1208.36]  No.
[1208.36 --> 1209.10]  No.
[1209.12 --> 1210.30]  No.
[1210.30 --> 1211.00]  No.
[1211.00 --> 1211.46]  No.
[1211.46 --> 1211.50]  No.
[1211.50 --> 1211.60]  No.
[1215.56 --> 1215.84]  No.
[1219.90 --> 1220.50]  No.
[1220.50 --> 1220.56]  No.
[1220.60 --> 1221.30]  No.
[1225.40 --> 1225.94]  Yes.
[1228.58 --> 1229.14]  No.
[1231.42 --> 1236.00]  No.
[1236.00 --> 1237.08]  No.
[1237.08 --> 1238.30]  No.
[1238.30 --> 1238.46]  No.
[1238.46 --> 1238.90]  No.
[1238.90 --> 1239.08]  No.
[1239.08 --> 1243.32]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1244.22 --> 1252.28]  Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings.
[1253.00 --> 1261.34]  Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings.
[1261.34 --> 1269.96]  Glory, lift up your name with hearts full of praise.
[1270.46 --> 1273.92]  Be exalted, O Lord my God.
[1274.18 --> 1276.72]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1278.90 --> 1285.46]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1285.46 --> 1294.18]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1296.26 --> 1304.68]  Lord, we lift up your name with hearts full of praise.
[1305.24 --> 1308.54]  Be exalted, O Lord my God.
[1308.78 --> 1311.26]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1311.26 --> 1312.68]  Lord, we lift up.
[1312.68 --> 1321.74]  Lord, we lift up your name with hearts full of praise.
[1322.14 --> 1325.68]  Be exalted, O Lord my God.
[1325.92 --> 1328.90]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1330.60 --> 1331.82]  You may be seated.
[1331.82 --> 1344.90]  Even as the crowds praised Jesus, as he entered Jerusalem, Jesus grieved their rejection of him.
[1345.70 --> 1348.48]  He wanted to gather them into his saving grace.
[1349.66 --> 1354.64]  What a sobering thought as we enter now into our time of confession.
[1354.64 --> 1357.48]  Thank you.
[1365.88 --> 1366.08]  Amen.
[1366.38 --> 1373.70]  I looked up and I saw my Lord a coming.
[1373.70 --> 1388.88]  I looked up and I saw my Lord coming down the road.
[1394.28 --> 1398.30]  Hallelujah, He is coming.
[1398.30 --> 1408.00]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1411.94 --> 1415.78]  Hallelujah, He is coming.
[1420.78 --> 1425.38]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1428.30 --> 1436.00]  I looked up and I saw my Lord who weeping.
[1436.00 --> 1447.52]  I looked up and I saw my Lord who weeping for my sin.
[1447.52 --> 1459.66]  Hallelujah, He is coming.
[1459.66 --> 1469.22]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1469.36 --> 1477.14]  Hallelujah, He is coming.
[1481.36 --> 1486.22]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1486.22 --> 1487.92]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1487.92 --> 1489.92]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1489.92 --> 1491.92]  Hallelujah, He is here.
[1491.92 --> 1492.38]  Let's pray.
[1493.92 --> 1500.16]  Oh Lord, you who on this day entered the rebellious city that later rejected you.
[1500.86 --> 1504.82]  We confess that our wills are as rebellious as Jerusalem's.
[1505.32 --> 1508.56]  That our faith is often more show than substance.
[1508.56 --> 1511.22]  That our hearts are in need of cleansing.
[1512.28 --> 1517.10]  Have mercy on us, Son of David, Savior of our lives.
[1517.84 --> 1522.84]  Help us to lay at your feet all that we have and all that we are.
[1523.48 --> 1525.86]  Trusting you to forgive what is sinful.
[1526.46 --> 1527.98]  To heal what is broken.
[1529.68 --> 1534.34]  We pray that you will welcome our praises and receive us as your own.
[1534.84 --> 1535.10]  Amen.
[1535.10 --> 1535.24]  Amen.
[1538.56 --> 1543.68]  Our assurance will be on the screen as a responsive reading.
[1545.52 --> 1547.28]  Hosanna to the Son of David.
[1548.14 --> 1550.98]  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[1552.12 --> 1556.18]  For Christ came into the world not to condemn the world,
[1556.82 --> 1559.98]  but that the world through Him should be saved.
[1559.98 --> 1564.94]  Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children,
[1565.44 --> 1568.38]  and walk in love as Christ loved us,
[1568.68 --> 1571.08]  and gave Himself up for us,
[1571.56 --> 1574.46]  a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[1575.30 --> 1575.94]  Hosanna.
[1576.70 --> 1577.10]  Amen.
[1579.90 --> 1585.12]  I'm going to ask you to rise for our song of response to the assurance.
[1585.12 --> 1605.02]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our King.
[1605.02 --> 1613.22]  Make known the power of His grace, the beauty of His peace.
[1613.72 --> 1621.34]  Remember how His mercy reached, and we cried out to Him.
[1622.02 --> 1630.02]  He lifted us to solid ground, to freedom from our sin.
[1630.02 --> 1638.40]  Oh, sin my soul, and tell all He's done,
[1638.40 --> 1643.80]  till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[1643.80 --> 1654.80]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[1654.80 --> 1662.80]  His power in us is greater than, is greater than this world.
[1663.30 --> 1670.80]  To share the reason for our hope, to serve with love and grace.
[1670.80 --> 1679.70]  That all who see Him shine through us, I bring the Father's praise.
[1680.10 --> 1687.88]  Oh, sin my soul, and tell all He's done,
[1688.26 --> 1693.20]  till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[1696.42 --> 1697.80]  You may be seated.
[1697.80 --> 1704.34]  We're happy to have Pastor Jason back with us.
[1704.52 --> 1707.46]  He's had a rough go, being ill for a few weeks.
[1708.14 --> 1712.34]  So, he's going to continue his series,
[1713.30 --> 1715.42]  and we welcome him up now.
[1715.76 --> 1716.60]  Thanks, Pastor Jason.
[1716.60 --> 1716.70]  Thank you.
[1716.70 --> 1716.72]  Thank you.
[1727.80 --> 1729.42]  Good morning.
[1734.42 --> 1738.50]  So, today is the last Sunday in the church season of Lent.
[1739.76 --> 1742.76]  And if you're not aware of this, Lent is part of the church calendar.
[1743.70 --> 1749.90]  And it's a 40-day season that is meant to mirror the 40 days that Jesus spent in the wilderness,
[1749.90 --> 1759.46]  preparing for His ministry, which was also a ministry that eventually and ultimately led to His own death on the cross.
[1759.46 --> 1770.02]  So, as a way for us to follow Jesus during this season of Lent, in order for us to grow in grace as a church family,
[1770.30 --> 1775.72]  we have been preparing, like Jesus did in the wilderness, for our own deaths.
[1775.72 --> 1783.16]  And we've been doing this by way of a sermon series that we've called Remember Your Death.
[1785.26 --> 1792.24]  And this idea of remembering your death is a biblical practice.
[1792.24 --> 1799.52]  So, for instance, the very first passage we looked at in our series was from Psalm 90.
[1800.12 --> 1802.20]  And Psalm 90, verse 12 says,
[1803.66 --> 1809.10]  So, teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[1810.68 --> 1814.92]  And so, how do you number your days?
[1814.92 --> 1826.56]  Well, it's the idea of holding our own death before our face and contemplating the reality that at some point, your life will end.
[1827.18 --> 1828.92]  That's what it means, to number your days.
[1829.86 --> 1834.32]  And then as we do that, Psalm 90 says, it helps us to gain a heart of wisdom.
[1834.32 --> 1835.32]  Right?
[1835.32 --> 1840.70]  Because what it does is it reframes and it reorients the rest of our lives.
[1840.96 --> 1845.64]  So that we live each day in light of this.
[1846.72 --> 1849.08]  And so, this is a powerful spiritual practice.
[1849.32 --> 1850.90]  And it is a worthy one.
[1852.04 --> 1857.04]  And our prayer is that by cultivating a heart of wisdom, by remembering death,
[1857.04 --> 1864.38]  it can be sort of the good soil out of which we can grow resilient joy and hope.
[1865.34 --> 1867.38]  And that these things can flourish in us.
[1868.20 --> 1871.18]  And so, this is the final sermon of this short series.
[1871.50 --> 1872.80]  Got cut a little bit shorter.
[1873.40 --> 1877.12]  So, this is our fourth passage that we've looked at in this series.
[1877.50 --> 1881.24]  And today, we will be turning to 1 Thessalonians in the New Testament.
[1881.86 --> 1883.08]  1 Thessalonians 4.
[1883.08 --> 1886.86]  But first, before we turn there, let me tell you a little bit about this
[1886.86 --> 1889.26]  in order to give us some context to the letter.
[1889.96 --> 1893.34]  So, this is the Apostle Paul's earliest written letter.
[1894.42 --> 1899.16]  He wrote these words to a group of first century Christian converts
[1899.16 --> 1901.74]  in the city of Thessalonica.
[1903.06 --> 1905.52]  So, here's the situation that's going on.
[1906.12 --> 1910.16]  So, this is a Greek city, mostly a pagan city.
[1910.16 --> 1915.08]  But there is a small community of Christians that have formed.
[1916.20 --> 1920.16]  And over the years, as this church has gathered and worshipped
[1920.16 --> 1921.78]  and followed Jesus in their city,
[1922.60 --> 1928.10]  some of the brothers and sisters in this church family have died.
[1929.44 --> 1933.44]  And this has created some distress in the church.
[1934.08 --> 1937.26]  And Paul is writing to comfort them.
[1937.80 --> 1939.16]  Paul is writing to comfort them.
[1939.16 --> 1943.58]  So, let's read together 1 Thessalonians 4.
[1943.82 --> 1945.52]  And we'll read verses 13 to 18.
[1947.32 --> 1949.26]  So, I invite you to open a Bible.
[1949.42 --> 1952.06]  We'll be going through the text together.
[1953.56 --> 1955.10]  1 Thessalonians 4.
[1955.28 --> 1957.38]  It's on page 879 in your pew Bible.
[1958.36 --> 1959.70]  We'll also have the words up here.
[1960.70 --> 1962.76]  So, we'll read verses 13 to 18.
[1962.76 --> 1971.36]  Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep,
[1971.92 --> 1975.64]  or to grieve like the rest of men who have no hope.
[1976.68 --> 1979.26]  We believe that Jesus died and rose again.
[1979.92 --> 1984.16]  So, we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
[1984.16 --> 1986.86]  According to the Lord's own word,
[1987.46 --> 1990.40]  we tell you that we who are still alive,
[1990.52 --> 1992.26]  who are left till the coming of the Lord,
[1992.66 --> 1995.98]  will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[1996.76 --> 1999.10]  For the Lord himself will come down from heaven
[1999.10 --> 2000.76]  with a loud command,
[2001.16 --> 2002.58]  with the voice of the archangel,
[2002.58 --> 2004.60]  and with the trumpet call of God.
[2005.22 --> 2007.20]  And the dead in Christ will rise first.
[2008.08 --> 2011.02]  After that, we who are still alive and are left
[2011.02 --> 2013.88]  will be caught up together with them in the clouds
[2013.88 --> 2015.60]  to meet the Lord in the air.
[2016.14 --> 2018.70]  And so, we will be with the Lord forever.
[2019.66 --> 2023.64]  Therefore, encourage each other with these words.
[2024.50 --> 2025.74]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2028.06 --> 2030.04]  Let's pray and let's ask for God's blessing
[2030.04 --> 2032.54]  upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[2032.58 --> 2035.84]  Heavenly Father, again this morning,
[2036.02 --> 2037.54]  we thank you for your word.
[2037.78 --> 2039.16]  Lord, we thank you that it is true
[2039.16 --> 2040.72]  and that it is given to us in love.
[2042.36 --> 2045.18]  And Lord, we pray that just as you spoke these words
[2045.18 --> 2047.78]  to this church in the first century,
[2048.24 --> 2049.10]  to comfort them,
[2049.60 --> 2050.66]  to comfort those who are grieving,
[2050.86 --> 2052.96]  Lord, that you would speak these same words to us this morning.
[2053.74 --> 2055.16]  That we would be comforted
[2055.16 --> 2058.08]  and that we would grow in hope.
[2058.92 --> 2060.16]  We pray, Lord, for your blessing.
[2060.66 --> 2062.04]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[2063.54 --> 2065.96]  So today, we're going to be talking about
[2065.96 --> 2068.72]  how to grieve as a Christian.
[2069.58 --> 2071.36]  How to grieve with hope.
[2072.26 --> 2073.38]  And this is important.
[2074.04 --> 2077.16]  Okay, and it's important because just as we've been talking about,
[2077.42 --> 2080.06]  just as each one of us will someday die
[2080.06 --> 2082.94]  in the day, in the moment that the Lord has determined,
[2082.94 --> 2089.08]  probably each one of us will also have to grieve.
[2089.48 --> 2094.76]  We'll have to grieve someone else who we love and care about who has passed away.
[2095.74 --> 2098.62]  And our text here in 1 Thessalonians can help us.
[2099.14 --> 2102.52]  It can help us in those times of grief that we all will face.
[2103.24 --> 2107.60]  And I know for some of us, we are actually in moments now of grief.
[2107.60 --> 2110.86]  And so I hope that these words can be encouraging to us,
[2110.94 --> 2114.76]  not only now, but in any time that we might have to face.
[2114.82 --> 2118.74]  And so that we would be equipped to know how to grieve with hope as Christians.
[2119.28 --> 2122.16]  So what I want to do today is just I want to walk through the text
[2122.16 --> 2126.62]  and see what Paul says to comfort grieving Christians.
[2127.56 --> 2129.50]  Again, because these are God's words,
[2129.64 --> 2132.38]  not only to the first century, but also to us today.
[2132.38 --> 2136.32]  There are words of instruction and comfort for us as well.
[2136.82 --> 2138.16]  So we're going to walk through the text.
[2138.26 --> 2140.76]  And so we're going to pick up again in verse 13.
[2141.36 --> 2146.10]  So notice in verse 13 that Paul begins by contrasting two types of people.
[2147.28 --> 2147.90]  He says,
[2148.46 --> 2154.06]  So that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind who have no hope.
[2155.26 --> 2159.62]  So Paul writes that he doesn't want these first century Christians
[2159.62 --> 2165.50]  to grieve the way that their neighbors do who have no hope.
[2166.66 --> 2173.18]  Now then, what would grief look like in first century Greek, in that Greek context?
[2173.90 --> 2178.24]  Well, if you were to attend a funeral in first century Thessalonica,
[2178.76 --> 2182.40]  what you would encounter would be a very loud environment.
[2183.28 --> 2189.00]  There would be people screaming and wailing in a way that is very dramatic.
[2189.62 --> 2192.86]  Because as one Greek philosopher wrote,
[2193.30 --> 2196.62]  hope is for the living, not for the dead.
[2198.08 --> 2200.86]  And so you would find people grieving with strong emotion,
[2201.26 --> 2202.74]  even with desperation.
[2203.88 --> 2206.60]  And Paul is writing to these Christians and he's saying,
[2207.16 --> 2209.26]  Hey, you do not have to do that.
[2209.36 --> 2212.64]  Don't be like your pagan neighbors.
[2212.64 --> 2212.86]  Don't be like your pagan neighbors.
[2213.64 --> 2216.46]  And not only do you not have to grieve in this way,
[2216.60 --> 2217.72]  you shouldn't.
[2219.34 --> 2222.08]  Now, we don't live in that context, right?
[2222.20 --> 2225.96]  So what does grieving without hope look like today?
[2227.02 --> 2230.22]  Well, one thing I thought of is that in our culture today,
[2230.32 --> 2231.82]  the way we deal with death,
[2232.30 --> 2234.72]  and especially my generation and younger,
[2234.72 --> 2239.38]  is to see death more as a friend than an enemy.
[2240.50 --> 2243.78]  And so it's this idea that death is inevitable.
[2244.60 --> 2245.78]  Death comes for us all,
[2245.90 --> 2250.34]  and therefore it should be embraced as a friend and not resisted.
[2251.12 --> 2252.92]  Death is just a natural part of life.
[2253.40 --> 2257.42]  And a version of this would be the Lion King, right?
[2257.98 --> 2259.46]  Now, I don't know about my voice right now,
[2259.54 --> 2262.80]  but it's the circle of life.
[2262.94 --> 2264.70]  You know, that song, right?
[2264.80 --> 2267.18]  A very catchy tune, the circle of life.
[2268.16 --> 2272.86]  The idea at root of that song is just a celebration of death, right?
[2272.88 --> 2277.02]  It's an embrace of death as a natural part of the life cycle.
[2278.34 --> 2282.24]  So Peter Kreeft, who is a Christian writer and thinker,
[2282.24 --> 2286.46]  he tells a story about a seven-year-old boy whose cousin has died.
[2287.22 --> 2288.66]  And he looks at his mom, and he says,
[2288.74 --> 2290.68]  Mom, where is my cousin now?
[2291.68 --> 2295.22]  And she gives him the Lion King circle of life kind of answer.
[2295.32 --> 2295.82]  She says,
[2296.36 --> 2299.52]  Your cousin has gone back to the earth from which we all come.
[2300.38 --> 2302.16]  Death is a natural part of the life cycle.
[2302.66 --> 2305.88]  And so when you see the earth put forth new flowers next spring,
[2306.48 --> 2310.76]  you can know that it's your cousin's life that is fertilizing those flowers.
[2311.56 --> 2313.04]  And the boy screams,
[2313.34 --> 2315.08]  I don't want my cousin to be fertilizer.
[2315.08 --> 2316.76]  And he runs off.
[2319.64 --> 2322.62]  Because, I mean, that's the natural response.
[2322.70 --> 2323.92]  I don't want my cousin to be fertilizer.
[2324.44 --> 2325.58]  What kind of answer is that?
[2326.82 --> 2329.82]  That doesn't answer the problem of death.
[2329.82 --> 2336.28]  And so if the first century context shows very excessive grief,
[2337.20 --> 2339.86]  I think today we're kind of on the opposite end of the spectrum
[2339.86 --> 2344.48]  where we almost deny grief because death is just a natural part of life.
[2345.46 --> 2348.22]  But that, too, is not the Christian response to death.
[2348.22 --> 2353.36]  Because embracing death, if we embrace it, it tells a lie about what death is.
[2353.82 --> 2355.94]  It calls an enemy a friend.
[2356.56 --> 2357.18]  And it's not.
[2357.18 --> 2363.26]  So it's important for us to see here that Paul also, he does not banish grieving.
[2363.38 --> 2365.48]  He doesn't say, don't grieve.
[2365.72 --> 2367.72]  That is inappropriate for a Christian.
[2367.86 --> 2368.74]  He doesn't say that.
[2369.40 --> 2373.00]  These Christians are grieving appropriately so.
[2373.00 --> 2376.50]  Death is not the way that God made the world to be.
[2377.20 --> 2380.98]  And the only honest response to death is grief.
[2382.20 --> 2389.16]  But Paul says, I'm concerned that you are grieving without hope.
[2390.20 --> 2397.40]  So then he goes on to tell them what the true hope that we can have as Christians is.
[2397.40 --> 2400.62]  So, verse 14, he goes on.
[2401.18 --> 2402.18]  For we believe.
[2403.32 --> 2405.04]  Let's just stop and think about that phrase.
[2406.14 --> 2408.94]  What he's saying is the thing that is going to give us hope
[2408.94 --> 2412.46]  is something that we need to trust.
[2413.42 --> 2415.08]  We need to have faith in.
[2415.16 --> 2416.16]  We need to believe.
[2417.04 --> 2418.76]  God wants us to know him.
[2419.46 --> 2423.36]  He wants us to believe in him and trust him and know his word
[2423.36 --> 2428.30]  and put our belief in it so that we can build our lives upon it.
[2429.02 --> 2430.82]  So how are we going to have hope?
[2430.90 --> 2433.68]  It's going to be by staking our lives,
[2433.82 --> 2436.74]  staking our behavior on the mountain,
[2437.00 --> 2439.06]  the firm foundation of what God says.
[2439.74 --> 2441.42]  So he says, for we believe.
[2441.94 --> 2444.56]  Then what is the truth that Paul wants us to know?
[2444.96 --> 2446.36]  He continues in verse 14.
[2446.36 --> 2450.38]  For we believe that Jesus died and he rose again.
[2450.38 --> 2454.54]  And so we believe that God will bring with Jesus
[2454.54 --> 2456.54]  those who have fallen asleep in him.
[2457.50 --> 2457.90]  Right?
[2457.94 --> 2462.02]  And so what Paul is referencing here is the bedrock foundation,
[2462.22 --> 2466.58]  the unmovable, unshakable truth of what Christians believe.
[2467.22 --> 2470.36]  And so this Christian story is very unique.
[2470.46 --> 2471.58]  We have to realize that.
[2471.98 --> 2476.38]  In contrast to the pagan Roman mythologies of the majority people
[2476.38 --> 2478.06]  in first century Thessalonica.
[2478.06 --> 2478.38]  Right?
[2479.06 --> 2482.16]  The story, the Christian story, is a story of God
[2482.16 --> 2485.18]  who became human in the person of Jesus,
[2486.14 --> 2488.36]  who came and lived a perfect life,
[2488.56 --> 2490.38]  who died on a Roman cross,
[2490.56 --> 2494.00]  and then three days later he rose again to new life.
[2494.94 --> 2498.58]  And so Jesus is the firstborn from the dead, the Bible says.
[2499.38 --> 2504.00]  Christ died, but then he rose again with the life of God inside of him.
[2504.08 --> 2504.90]  He was alive.
[2505.00 --> 2507.34]  He was connected to God who was the source of life.
[2507.34 --> 2509.82]  And he ascended to the right hand of God.
[2510.16 --> 2512.26]  So Jesus is truly alive.
[2513.34 --> 2517.28]  He and he is the first one who has gone through the curtain of death
[2517.28 --> 2520.06]  and who has come through on the other side.
[2521.14 --> 2524.28]  And that means that death is not ultimate.
[2525.14 --> 2529.18]  That death is not the end because Christ has conquered sin and death.
[2529.18 --> 2534.56]  And Paul is saying that just as we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[2535.00 --> 2541.16]  so we also believe that God will resurrect all of those who put their faith and their trust in him.
[2541.16 --> 2545.38]  And so that's what Paul says here in verse 14.
[2545.48 --> 2548.24]  And then in verse 15, he goes on to give some more detail.
[2549.18 --> 2549.50]  He says,
[2549.64 --> 2551.44]  According to the Lord's word,
[2552.16 --> 2554.62]  we tell you that we who are still alive,
[2554.84 --> 2557.04]  who are left until the coming of the Lord,
[2557.14 --> 2560.10]  will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[2560.10 --> 2569.28]  So now Paul here is putting his finger on what is troubling these first century Christians.
[2570.18 --> 2572.76]  So what is the problem in Thessalonica?
[2573.70 --> 2577.08]  Paul has got word that some in the church are very concerned.
[2577.32 --> 2578.30]  They're worried.
[2579.08 --> 2582.58]  They're feeling a bit hopeless because they are thinking,
[2582.58 --> 2586.46]  Okay, we must keep watch until the Lord returns.
[2587.54 --> 2590.74]  They're thinking at any moment, Jesus will return.
[2591.60 --> 2591.70]  Right?
[2591.80 --> 2599.08]  And Jesus, indeed, himself taught his disciples many times to keep watch because he is coming back.
[2600.18 --> 2602.10]  So there is a group of Christians.
[2602.30 --> 2603.20]  They're watching.
[2603.48 --> 2604.02]  That's good.
[2604.52 --> 2605.54]  They're keeping watch.
[2606.20 --> 2608.20]  But the years are going by.
[2609.12 --> 2610.50]  Jesus hasn't yet returned.
[2610.50 --> 2616.40]  And some of their friends and their family members have died before the Lord's second coming.
[2617.32 --> 2621.10]  So they're concerned that their loved ones who have died,
[2621.20 --> 2623.84]  that they are somehow going to miss out.
[2625.28 --> 2626.22]  Something's gone wrong.
[2626.30 --> 2627.16]  Jesus hasn't come back.
[2627.22 --> 2627.64]  They've died.
[2627.90 --> 2629.52]  How do we make sense of this?
[2629.62 --> 2631.30]  What's going to happen to them?
[2632.74 --> 2634.72]  Now, Paul, Jesus didn't teach that.
[2634.80 --> 2635.90]  Paul didn't teach that.
[2636.46 --> 2639.26]  But there's this erroneous teaching,
[2639.26 --> 2640.58]  or at least his worry,
[2641.14 --> 2642.44]  has kind of crept in.
[2643.10 --> 2644.32]  And the believers are going,
[2644.46 --> 2644.92]  Oh no,
[2645.72 --> 2648.52]  why couldn't my loved ones stay alive until Jesus came?
[2649.36 --> 2650.54]  What will happen to them?
[2651.48 --> 2653.32]  And Paul's answer?
[2654.10 --> 2654.54]  He says,
[2654.80 --> 2655.76]  They're just sleeping.
[2656.98 --> 2657.84]  That's his answer.
[2657.92 --> 2658.68]  They're just sleeping.
[2659.76 --> 2660.00]  Right?
[2660.08 --> 2662.22]  And that is the Christian word for death.
[2662.22 --> 2665.10]  How appropriate is that, right?
[2665.68 --> 2667.38]  Just as sleep,
[2667.88 --> 2668.98]  when we go to sleep at night,
[2669.06 --> 2671.64]  it's followed by waking up.
[2672.44 --> 2676.38]  So death is followed by resurrection.
[2678.78 --> 2679.70]  That's, you know,
[2679.76 --> 2683.14]  the word cemetery means a sleeping place.
[2683.60 --> 2684.76]  That's what the word means.
[2684.76 --> 2688.30]  And so he's comforting them by telling them this.
[2688.68 --> 2688.88]  He says,
[2689.12 --> 2689.50]  Don't worry.
[2689.60 --> 2691.70]  If you're alive when Jesus comes back,
[2692.24 --> 2693.86]  that doesn't get you ahead.
[2694.12 --> 2695.46]  That doesn't mean you're like,
[2696.04 --> 2697.72]  have some special benefit.
[2698.46 --> 2699.74]  And those who have died
[2699.74 --> 2702.80]  also are not second class citizens
[2702.80 --> 2704.04]  in God's future kingdom.
[2704.64 --> 2705.12]  So he says,
[2705.18 --> 2705.54]  Don't worry.
[2705.62 --> 2706.76]  We're all in this together.
[2706.92 --> 2708.00]  We're going to be together.
[2708.16 --> 2710.02]  Those who have died first,
[2710.22 --> 2712.12]  and those who are still alive when Jesus comes,
[2712.46 --> 2713.80]  we're all going to be resurrected.
[2713.80 --> 2715.34]  Don't worry.
[2716.96 --> 2717.94]  So now,
[2718.12 --> 2720.14]  do you see that phrase there in verse 15
[2720.14 --> 2721.04]  where it says,
[2721.74 --> 2723.02]  The coming of the Lord.
[2723.96 --> 2724.08]  Right?
[2724.14 --> 2725.06]  The coming of the Lord.
[2725.62 --> 2726.30]  So there,
[2726.46 --> 2729.02]  Paul is using a technical term.
[2729.52 --> 2730.60]  It's the Greek word,
[2731.26 --> 2732.08]  parousia.
[2733.10 --> 2733.32]  Okay?
[2733.42 --> 2733.96]  Parousia.
[2734.78 --> 2737.74]  It's a word that his readers would understand
[2737.74 --> 2740.08]  from their own cultural context.
[2740.58 --> 2742.28]  It's a word that was used
[2742.28 --> 2745.28]  to describe the coming of a dignitary,
[2745.92 --> 2747.82]  like a king or an emperor.
[2748.52 --> 2752.60]  And they knew that when a dignitary arrived at your city,
[2752.78 --> 2757.02]  everyone was expected to honor that dignitary properly.
[2757.02 --> 2759.02]  And this would be,
[2759.14 --> 2760.32]  if a king came,
[2760.42 --> 2761.56]  this parousia,
[2761.78 --> 2762.96]  this coming of a dignitary,
[2763.06 --> 2764.46]  it would be a big deal
[2764.46 --> 2766.58]  for any city in the Roman Empire.
[2767.12 --> 2769.04]  Because this doesn't happen every year.
[2769.16 --> 2771.98]  This is like a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
[2772.98 --> 2775.28]  So as the king comes to town,
[2776.06 --> 2778.50]  coins would be minted in their honor.
[2778.50 --> 2780.42]  And they would often say
[2780.42 --> 2781.80]  that a new era
[2781.80 --> 2784.22]  has begun in that town
[2784.22 --> 2787.08]  as a result of the arrival of the king.
[2788.36 --> 2789.58]  And so what Paul does here
[2789.58 --> 2791.28]  is he hijacks that word
[2791.28 --> 2792.18]  that they all understood,
[2792.58 --> 2793.40]  and he says,
[2793.80 --> 2796.26]  this is how Christ is coming.
[2796.98 --> 2799.92]  He is like this arriving dignitary,
[2800.04 --> 2801.32]  the arrival of a king,
[2801.58 --> 2804.78]  and he is coming to inaugurate a new era.
[2804.78 --> 2808.02]  So then in verse 16,
[2808.70 --> 2810.12]  how is he going to come?
[2811.26 --> 2811.84]  It says,
[2812.02 --> 2813.08]  for the Lord himself
[2813.08 --> 2814.72]  will come down from heaven
[2814.72 --> 2816.36]  with a loud command,
[2816.66 --> 2818.60]  with the voice of the archangel,
[2819.08 --> 2821.56]  and with the trumpet call of God.
[2823.62 --> 2823.90]  Right?
[2823.96 --> 2824.22]  Wow.
[2825.16 --> 2826.44]  When Jesus comes back,
[2826.52 --> 2828.82]  it will be with authority.
[2829.76 --> 2830.92]  Everyone's going to hear.
[2831.58 --> 2831.70]  Right?
[2831.76 --> 2833.78]  Everyone is going to take notice
[2833.78 --> 2834.76]  and pay attention.
[2834.78 --> 2837.86]  So I know in school,
[2838.30 --> 2839.54]  for you teachers,
[2840.30 --> 2841.44]  it's class time.
[2841.66 --> 2842.98]  The teacher comes in and says,
[2843.08 --> 2843.78]  okay, everyone,
[2843.98 --> 2845.24]  take your seats now.
[2845.36 --> 2846.40]  It's time to begin
[2846.40 --> 2847.82]  the lesson of the day.
[2848.26 --> 2849.56]  And what's the response?
[2852.24 --> 2853.18]  Everyone's chattering.
[2854.34 --> 2854.46]  Right?
[2854.50 --> 2855.54]  Everyone's so busy,
[2855.96 --> 2856.64]  engaged,
[2857.04 --> 2858.08]  talking with each other.
[2858.26 --> 2859.30]  They're not really interested
[2859.30 --> 2860.28]  in what the teacher
[2860.28 --> 2861.60]  in the front has to say.
[2862.68 --> 2862.88]  Okay?
[2862.88 --> 2865.28]  That is not what it's going to be like
[2865.28 --> 2866.48]  when Jesus returns.
[2868.84 --> 2870.02]  Here's another example.
[2870.72 --> 2872.50]  So maybe you've experienced this.
[2872.58 --> 2875.14]  Sitting at home on a quiet afternoon,
[2875.14 --> 2879.06]  and everyone is maybe watching TV,
[2879.06 --> 2880.88]  or they're taking a nap,
[2880.88 --> 2882.10]  or they're reading a book,
[2882.50 --> 2883.54]  and suddenly,
[2883.74 --> 2884.80]  a thunderclap
[2884.80 --> 2888.36]  just makes everyone jump.
[2889.02 --> 2890.14]  And you can almost feel
[2890.14 --> 2891.50]  the reverberation,
[2891.64 --> 2891.86]  right,
[2891.94 --> 2893.04]  in the house.
[2893.80 --> 2894.86]  And it doesn't matter
[2894.86 --> 2895.76]  if you are asleep,
[2895.86 --> 2896.34]  it doesn't matter
[2896.34 --> 2897.30]  if you are watching TV
[2897.30 --> 2897.78]  or reading,
[2897.86 --> 2899.34]  you are called to attention
[2899.34 --> 2900.68]  in a moment.
[2900.68 --> 2902.74]  And Paul says,
[2902.94 --> 2904.24]  with this kind of authority,
[2904.78 --> 2906.18]  Christ is coming back
[2906.18 --> 2907.92]  with a cry of command.
[2909.00 --> 2910.98]  And those who their whole lives,
[2911.06 --> 2912.42]  who've disregarded him,
[2913.14 --> 2914.58]  who haven't wanted to listen
[2914.58 --> 2915.42]  to what he has to say,
[2915.50 --> 2916.58]  who can care less,
[2917.36 --> 2918.36]  but in a moment,
[2918.48 --> 2919.68]  with this cry of command,
[2919.76 --> 2920.38]  with authority,
[2920.70 --> 2922.48]  he is going to call everyone
[2922.48 --> 2923.46]  to attention.
[2924.90 --> 2926.60]  This is the dignitary
[2926.60 --> 2927.74]  par excellence
[2927.74 --> 2929.22]  who has come.
[2929.30 --> 2930.64]  He is the king of kings.
[2930.90 --> 2932.76]  He is the Lord of lords.
[2934.86 --> 2935.08]  You know,
[2935.14 --> 2936.90]  Jesus says in John 5,
[2937.42 --> 2937.74]  he says,
[2937.82 --> 2939.24]  do not be amazed at this,
[2939.58 --> 2940.96]  for a time is coming
[2940.96 --> 2943.68]  when all who are in their graves
[2943.68 --> 2946.74]  will hear his voice.
[2949.22 --> 2950.82]  And so just as God,
[2950.94 --> 2951.86]  in creation,
[2952.52 --> 2954.74]  spoke the words of command
[2954.74 --> 2957.10]  and everything came to be,
[2958.04 --> 2959.80]  on that last day,
[2959.80 --> 2961.92]  the dead will hear the creative,
[2963.02 --> 2964.54]  commanding voice of God.
[2965.18 --> 2967.14]  And they will obey.
[2969.44 --> 2970.92]  And then what will happen
[2970.92 --> 2972.62]  when the king comes back?
[2973.42 --> 2975.50]  Verses 16 to 17 go on.
[2975.50 --> 2978.72]  The dead in Christ
[2978.72 --> 2980.04]  will rise first.
[2980.88 --> 2981.68]  After that,
[2981.96 --> 2983.38]  we who are still alive
[2983.38 --> 2984.14]  and are left
[2984.14 --> 2985.66]  will be caught up together
[2985.66 --> 2987.46]  with them in the clouds
[2987.46 --> 2989.22]  to meet the Lord in the air.
[2989.76 --> 2990.80]  And so we will be
[2990.80 --> 2991.74]  with the Lord forever.
[2991.74 --> 2995.22]  So this passage,
[2996.46 --> 2997.10]  verse 16,
[2997.20 --> 2997.58]  17,
[2997.58 --> 2999.50]  is the only place
[2999.50 --> 3000.38]  in the New Testament
[3000.38 --> 3002.70]  where what we call
[3002.70 --> 3003.62]  the rapture
[3003.62 --> 3005.80]  is clearly referred to.
[3005.92 --> 3007.14]  Has everyone heard this term,
[3007.56 --> 3008.18]  the rapture?
[3009.50 --> 3009.74]  Okay,
[3009.74 --> 3010.74]  some of you have heard this.
[3011.92 --> 3012.38]  Now,
[3012.44 --> 3014.40]  in order to understand this,
[3014.84 --> 3016.18]  we have to understand
[3016.18 --> 3017.96]  what Paul is referring to.
[3018.54 --> 3018.68]  Okay,
[3018.70 --> 3019.16]  so Paul,
[3019.36 --> 3019.68]  again,
[3019.90 --> 3021.56]  is making a very specific
[3021.56 --> 3022.52]  reference
[3022.52 --> 3024.18]  that to his
[3024.18 --> 3025.48]  first century audience
[3025.48 --> 3026.60]  they would understand,
[3027.36 --> 3028.08]  but that is not
[3028.08 --> 3029.42]  as familiar to us today.
[3029.80 --> 3031.04]  So we need to understand this.
[3031.56 --> 3032.54]  So here's what Paul
[3032.54 --> 3033.28]  is referring to,
[3033.38 --> 3033.96]  and I'm going to use
[3033.96 --> 3035.44]  two first century examples
[3035.44 --> 3036.34]  that I'm going to use
[3036.34 --> 3037.70]  one contemporary example.
[3038.56 --> 3038.68]  Okay,
[3038.70 --> 3039.52]  so here's the first
[3039.52 --> 3040.86]  first century example.
[3041.94 --> 3043.02]  If you were to go
[3043.02 --> 3043.72]  to a wedding
[3043.72 --> 3045.40]  in the first century,
[3046.00 --> 3047.14]  here is one thing
[3047.14 --> 3047.98]  that you would experience.
[3048.78 --> 3048.90]  Okay,
[3048.94 --> 3049.04]  well,
[3049.12 --> 3049.64]  first of all,
[3050.04 --> 3051.28]  a wedding in that day
[3051.28 --> 3052.40]  was not just one day
[3052.40 --> 3053.22]  like we have now.
[3053.32 --> 3053.84]  It would be,
[3054.10 --> 3054.64]  it would stretch
[3054.64 --> 3055.68]  into like a whole week.
[3056.46 --> 3057.88]  It would be multiple days.
[3058.16 --> 3059.52]  And at some point
[3059.52 --> 3061.72]  in this wedding week,
[3061.76 --> 3062.60]  this would happen.
[3063.18 --> 3064.54]  In the middle of the night,
[3065.06 --> 3065.80]  the groom
[3065.80 --> 3066.92]  with all of his buddies
[3066.92 --> 3068.76]  would lay some torches
[3068.76 --> 3070.08]  and they would walk
[3070.08 --> 3070.82]  through the town
[3070.82 --> 3071.66]  and they would go
[3071.66 --> 3073.06]  to the bride's house.
[3074.36 --> 3075.84]  And those brides,
[3076.00 --> 3076.76]  the bridesmaids
[3076.76 --> 3077.42]  who are waiting,
[3077.60 --> 3078.32]  they would hear
[3078.32 --> 3079.96]  the coming of the groom
[3079.96 --> 3082.08]  and they would go out
[3082.08 --> 3083.38]  and they would meet the groom
[3083.38 --> 3084.34]  in the wedding party
[3084.34 --> 3085.98]  and then they would
[3085.98 --> 3086.68]  together
[3086.68 --> 3088.14]  go back
[3088.14 --> 3089.80]  to the bride's house.
[3092.90 --> 3094.60]  And so the Bible here
[3094.60 --> 3096.90]  casts Jesus' return for us
[3096.90 --> 3098.06]  in terms of a love story,
[3098.36 --> 3099.26]  in terms of a marriage.
[3100.10 --> 3100.24]  Right?
[3100.34 --> 3101.30]  Jesus is the groom
[3101.30 --> 3102.64]  and he is coming for you,
[3102.74 --> 3103.20]  the bride.
[3103.20 --> 3104.64]  And he can't wait
[3104.64 --> 3105.24]  to see you.
[3105.46 --> 3106.08]  He can't wait
[3106.08 --> 3106.78]  to be with you.
[3107.88 --> 3108.92]  So that's the first
[3108.92 --> 3111.60]  first century context
[3111.60 --> 3112.52]  that people would have understood.
[3112.72 --> 3113.54]  Here's the second one.
[3113.76 --> 3114.46]  Another example.
[3115.48 --> 3115.94]  Also,
[3116.32 --> 3117.34]  remember this visiting
[3117.34 --> 3117.86]  dignitary
[3117.86 --> 3118.68]  that we talked about?
[3120.04 --> 3121.10]  As he approached
[3121.10 --> 3121.80]  the city,
[3122.78 --> 3123.80]  it was incumbent
[3123.80 --> 3125.40]  upon all citizens
[3125.40 --> 3126.10]  of the city
[3126.10 --> 3127.44]  to get up,
[3127.82 --> 3129.32]  to leave their houses,
[3129.54 --> 3130.52]  to go out
[3130.52 --> 3131.36]  of the city
[3131.36 --> 3132.86]  to meet the king.
[3133.60 --> 3134.24]  And then,
[3134.38 --> 3135.12]  outside the city,
[3135.22 --> 3135.78]  they would gather
[3135.78 --> 3136.38]  around the king
[3136.38 --> 3137.38]  with great fanfare
[3137.38 --> 3138.08]  and trumpets
[3138.08 --> 3138.64]  and shouting
[3138.64 --> 3139.88]  and they would
[3139.88 --> 3141.88]  go back together
[3141.88 --> 3143.42]  into the city
[3143.42 --> 3144.54]  celebrating
[3144.54 --> 3145.58]  his arrival.
[3147.36 --> 3148.32]  And if that sounds
[3148.32 --> 3149.12]  kind of like what
[3149.12 --> 3149.98]  Marian was talking
[3149.98 --> 3150.64]  about earlier,
[3151.66 --> 3152.70]  you're absolutely right.
[3153.24 --> 3153.40]  Okay,
[3153.44 --> 3154.68]  this is the triumphal entry.
[3154.76 --> 3155.54]  That's what's going on.
[3155.78 --> 3156.28]  The people
[3156.28 --> 3157.92]  came out of the city
[3157.92 --> 3158.38]  of Jerusalem,
[3158.54 --> 3159.42]  they met Jesus,
[3159.42 --> 3160.62]  they shouted,
[3160.76 --> 3161.26]  Hosanna,
[3161.40 --> 3162.62]  he is the returning king,
[3162.72 --> 3163.66]  the great dignitary
[3163.66 --> 3164.74]  who has come.
[3165.38 --> 3166.84]  They greet him as king,
[3166.98 --> 3168.54]  then they accompany him
[3168.54 --> 3169.92]  back into the city
[3169.92 --> 3171.28]  as Jesus rode
[3171.28 --> 3171.96]  the donkey.
[3173.40 --> 3173.56]  Okay,
[3173.56 --> 3174.58]  so that's what's going on.
[3175.46 --> 3176.28]  And that's what Paul
[3176.28 --> 3177.24]  is talking about here.
[3177.76 --> 3178.12]  Now,
[3178.18 --> 3178.62]  let's put this
[3178.62 --> 3180.18]  into a 21st century context
[3180.18 --> 3181.16]  and think about this.
[3181.76 --> 3182.06]  So,
[3182.16 --> 3182.68]  if you have been
[3182.68 --> 3184.46]  separated from a loved one
[3184.46 --> 3185.60]  for a really long time,
[3186.44 --> 3186.64]  right,
[3186.72 --> 3187.58]  and then that person
[3187.58 --> 3188.96]  comes to visit you,
[3189.42 --> 3190.06]  so let's say,
[3190.16 --> 3190.32]  you know,
[3190.34 --> 3191.18]  it's a family member,
[3191.28 --> 3192.02]  you haven't seen them
[3192.02 --> 3193.26]  in say like three years
[3193.26 --> 3195.24]  and they say,
[3195.40 --> 3195.48]  hey,
[3195.52 --> 3196.36]  I'm coming to visit.
[3196.90 --> 3197.28]  So,
[3197.38 --> 3198.40]  they get on an airplane,
[3198.72 --> 3200.28]  they fly across the country,
[3200.56 --> 3201.36]  they land,
[3201.60 --> 3202.94]  they get a rental car,
[3203.12 --> 3204.50]  they drive to your house,
[3204.58 --> 3205.16]  they text you
[3205.16 --> 3206.00]  five minutes out.
[3206.00 --> 3207.66]  Of course,
[3207.78 --> 3207.86]  well,
[3207.94 --> 3209.04]  someone else texts them,
[3209.28 --> 3209.38]  you know,
[3209.42 --> 3209.60]  whatever.
[3210.78 --> 3212.40]  And they arrive,
[3212.48 --> 3212.78]  you see,
[3212.86 --> 3213.26]  you're waiting,
[3213.36 --> 3213.74]  you're waiting,
[3213.84 --> 3214.36]  you're expecting,
[3214.52 --> 3215.20]  they pull up
[3215.20 --> 3216.00]  into your driveway,
[3216.00 --> 3218.44]  you see the car pull in,
[3219.10 --> 3219.84]  what do you do?
[3221.68 --> 3223.08]  You go out,
[3223.20 --> 3223.48]  right?
[3224.24 --> 3224.76]  You go out,
[3224.78 --> 3225.56]  you don't just sit there
[3225.56 --> 3226.02]  and wait for them
[3226.02 --> 3226.82]  to knock on the door,
[3227.22 --> 3228.78]  you go out of your house,
[3229.42 --> 3230.26]  you wait for them
[3230.26 --> 3231.18]  to get out of the car,
[3231.28 --> 3232.10]  you go and you give them
[3232.10 --> 3232.88]  a big hug,
[3233.40 --> 3234.84]  and then together
[3234.84 --> 3235.96]  you go back
[3235.96 --> 3236.66]  into the house
[3236.66 --> 3238.54]  where you have some,
[3238.74 --> 3239.42]  you know,
[3239.64 --> 3240.76]  snacks and refreshments
[3240.76 --> 3241.08]  waiting.
[3241.08 --> 3244.16]  So these are the metaphors
[3244.16 --> 3245.42]  that Paul is referring to
[3245.42 --> 3247.10]  when Jesus returns.
[3248.06 --> 3248.96]  It will be like
[3248.96 --> 3249.78]  a wedding party
[3249.78 --> 3250.72]  going out to meet
[3250.72 --> 3251.90]  the groom in the streets
[3251.90 --> 3252.58]  and then going back
[3252.58 --> 3253.36]  to the bride's house.
[3253.94 --> 3254.64]  It will be like
[3254.64 --> 3255.56]  citizens of a city
[3255.56 --> 3256.28]  going out
[3256.28 --> 3257.74]  to meet the coming king
[3257.74 --> 3258.50]  and then returning
[3258.50 --> 3259.48]  to the city.
[3259.92 --> 3260.46]  It will be like
[3260.46 --> 3261.68]  a family member visiting
[3261.68 --> 3262.42]  and you're going out
[3262.42 --> 3263.10]  into the driveway
[3263.10 --> 3264.34]  and you meet them
[3264.34 --> 3265.48]  and you accompany them
[3265.48 --> 3266.76]  back into the house.
[3268.50 --> 3269.56]  And so the misunderstanding
[3269.56 --> 3270.78]  that many Christians
[3270.78 --> 3271.54]  have made
[3271.54 --> 3272.26]  when thinking
[3272.26 --> 3273.34]  about the rapture
[3273.34 --> 3275.36]  is that when Jesus returns
[3275.36 --> 3276.26]  that people of faith
[3276.26 --> 3277.66]  will somehow disappear
[3277.66 --> 3279.32]  or they will kind of
[3279.32 --> 3280.14]  be evaporated
[3280.14 --> 3281.06]  out of this world,
[3281.58 --> 3282.30]  leaving the world
[3282.30 --> 3283.26]  to then kind of descend
[3283.26 --> 3284.90]  into a state of chaos.
[3285.80 --> 3286.92]  That is not what
[3286.92 --> 3288.04]  he is describing here.
[3288.64 --> 3289.96]  The image is of
[3289.96 --> 3291.10]  all of God's people,
[3291.24 --> 3292.12]  those who have died
[3292.12 --> 3293.52]  and gone to be with Christ,
[3293.62 --> 3294.92]  those who are still alive,
[3295.58 --> 3296.34]  they're going to be
[3296.34 --> 3297.62]  gathered together
[3297.62 --> 3299.86]  around the returning king,
[3299.86 --> 3301.48]  the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3301.80 --> 3302.80]  And then together
[3302.80 --> 3303.80]  they are going to
[3303.80 --> 3304.88]  come back to earth
[3304.88 --> 3306.40]  while Jesus will reign
[3306.40 --> 3307.26]  victorious
[3307.26 --> 3309.72]  in a new heavens
[3309.72 --> 3310.62]  and a new earth.
[3311.56 --> 3311.84]  Right?
[3311.90 --> 3312.68]  So this is not about
[3312.68 --> 3313.70]  escaping earth,
[3313.82 --> 3314.82]  it's about returning
[3314.82 --> 3315.78]  victoriously then
[3315.78 --> 3316.64]  to earth.
[3317.18 --> 3317.66]  It's not like
[3317.66 --> 3318.58]  an alien abduction,
[3319.28 --> 3320.62]  it's the true king
[3320.62 --> 3321.94]  coming to rule
[3321.94 --> 3322.50]  and reign,
[3322.58 --> 3323.56]  the king of kings
[3323.56 --> 3325.12]  who has finally come
[3325.12 --> 3325.80]  and he is going
[3325.80 --> 3326.44]  to bring in
[3326.44 --> 3327.12]  his kingdom
[3327.12 --> 3328.04]  of justice
[3328.04 --> 3328.68]  and righteousness
[3328.68 --> 3330.36]  and restore all things.
[3331.24 --> 3332.40]  That's what's going on.
[3335.44 --> 3336.54]  Now finally,
[3336.86 --> 3337.96]  let's look
[3337.96 --> 3339.02]  at Paul's
[3339.02 --> 3340.04]  very practical
[3340.04 --> 3340.78]  conclusion
[3340.78 --> 3342.12]  in verse 18.
[3344.06 --> 3344.74]  He says,
[3345.06 --> 3345.30]  therefore,
[3345.68 --> 3346.50]  given everything
[3346.50 --> 3347.42]  I have just said,
[3347.60 --> 3348.14]  therefore,
[3349.10 --> 3350.58]  encourage one another
[3350.58 --> 3352.78]  with these words.
[3352.78 --> 3355.68]  So what's Paul doing?
[3356.58 --> 3357.44]  He's offering
[3357.44 --> 3358.24]  these words
[3358.24 --> 3359.16]  to encourage
[3359.16 --> 3361.06]  and to comfort
[3361.06 --> 3362.64]  those who are grieving.
[3363.30 --> 3364.38]  That is his point.
[3364.52 --> 3364.58]  Right?
[3364.62 --> 3365.28]  He's not trying
[3365.28 --> 3365.76]  to answer
[3365.76 --> 3366.62]  all the questions
[3366.62 --> 3367.46]  we may have
[3367.46 --> 3368.42]  about the second
[3368.42 --> 3369.22]  coming of Jesus,
[3369.32 --> 3369.74]  what it's going
[3369.74 --> 3370.30]  to be like.
[3370.82 --> 3371.92]  That's not what he's doing.
[3372.02 --> 3373.00]  This is pastoral.
[3374.04 --> 3375.00]  He's saying these things
[3375.00 --> 3375.92]  to comfort us,
[3376.04 --> 3376.64]  to comfort those
[3376.64 --> 3377.16]  who are grieving.
[3378.00 --> 3378.58]  He's saying,
[3378.70 --> 3378.90]  look,
[3379.38 --> 3380.90]  when a loved one dies,
[3380.90 --> 3382.84]  we are to grieve.
[3382.96 --> 3383.78]  That is appropriate.
[3384.66 --> 3385.72]  But we don't grieve
[3385.72 --> 3386.98]  as those who have no hope.
[3387.02 --> 3387.86]  We have this hope.
[3388.18 --> 3388.80]  Jesus died.
[3388.90 --> 3389.64]  He rose again.
[3389.94 --> 3391.02]  He's coming back.
[3391.30 --> 3391.88]  He's going to bring
[3391.88 --> 3392.40]  all of those
[3392.40 --> 3393.38]  who have died with him
[3393.38 --> 3394.44]  and we who are alive
[3394.44 --> 3395.30]  are going to meet him
[3395.30 --> 3395.98]  and we're all
[3395.98 --> 3396.70]  going to be together.
[3397.00 --> 3397.38]  There's going to be
[3397.38 --> 3398.90]  this great reunion
[3398.90 --> 3400.86]  when the king comes.
[3401.88 --> 3402.24]  Therefore,
[3402.58 --> 3403.28]  have hope.
[3403.68 --> 3404.34]  Be encouraged.
[3405.92 --> 3406.34]  Now,
[3406.42 --> 3408.32]  even as he says this,
[3409.32 --> 3410.20]  it somewhat can feel
[3410.20 --> 3411.44]  like what Paul is calling us
[3411.44 --> 3412.22]  to do in this passage
[3412.22 --> 3414.02]  is emotionally impossible.
[3415.02 --> 3416.74]  I mean like grieving with hope.
[3417.18 --> 3418.08]  How do you do though?
[3418.16 --> 3419.72]  Those things seem to be in tension.
[3420.52 --> 3421.22]  How do we hold
[3421.22 --> 3422.12]  these things together?
[3422.32 --> 3423.60]  Grief and hope.
[3425.34 --> 3425.90]  And friends,
[3426.18 --> 3427.32]  the answer lies
[3427.32 --> 3428.34]  in the cross
[3428.34 --> 3430.40]  and the empty tomb
[3430.40 --> 3431.30]  of Jesus.
[3432.50 --> 3433.32]  Holy week
[3433.32 --> 3434.78]  that Marian told us about
[3434.78 --> 3436.12]  and that is coming this week
[3436.12 --> 3437.80]  that we're about to enter into.
[3437.80 --> 3438.90]  It actually gives us
[3438.90 --> 3440.46]  in a very embodied
[3440.46 --> 3441.98]  sense
[3441.98 --> 3443.10]  in the church calendar
[3443.10 --> 3444.32]  a way of walking
[3444.32 --> 3445.16]  through the answer
[3445.16 --> 3445.88]  to that question.
[3447.10 --> 3447.60]  You see,
[3447.76 --> 3448.36]  the gap
[3448.36 --> 3449.84]  between grief
[3449.84 --> 3450.38]  and hope
[3450.38 --> 3452.52]  is exactly as wide
[3452.52 --> 3453.12]  as the gap
[3453.12 --> 3454.10]  between Good Friday
[3454.10 --> 3455.68]  and Easter Sunday.
[3456.54 --> 3457.06]  Right?
[3457.12 --> 3458.24]  There is a gap
[3458.24 --> 3459.66]  but it's not
[3459.66 --> 3460.58]  an infinite one.
[3461.04 --> 3461.46]  Right?
[3461.50 --> 3462.86]  It's a three-day gap.
[3462.86 --> 3465.70]  When a loved one dies,
[3465.96 --> 3467.40]  we find ourselves
[3467.40 --> 3469.32]  living in that gap.
[3470.28 --> 3471.64]  For those three days
[3471.64 --> 3472.38]  that for us
[3472.38 --> 3473.08]  and our lives
[3473.08 --> 3474.02]  they may become,
[3474.52 --> 3475.20]  they might stretch
[3475.20 --> 3475.94]  into weeks
[3475.94 --> 3476.94]  or months
[3476.94 --> 3477.58]  or years
[3477.58 --> 3478.56]  or decades.
[3479.80 --> 3480.54]  And all of us,
[3480.60 --> 3481.48]  after we experience
[3481.48 --> 3482.68]  the death of a loved one
[3482.68 --> 3484.00]  or someone we care about,
[3484.30 --> 3485.48]  we find ourselves
[3485.48 --> 3486.38]  in that space
[3486.38 --> 3487.30]  between Good Friday
[3487.30 --> 3487.98]  and Easter.
[3489.14 --> 3490.56]  And like the first century
[3490.56 --> 3491.88]  Christians of Thessalonica,
[3491.88 --> 3492.82]  we have nothing
[3492.82 --> 3493.74]  to cling to
[3493.74 --> 3495.46]  but the faith
[3495.46 --> 3497.04]  in the true words
[3497.04 --> 3498.16]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3498.16 --> 3498.78]  who says,
[3499.28 --> 3499.82]  I have risen
[3499.82 --> 3500.90]  and I will come back.
[3502.92 --> 3504.10]  But here's the thing,
[3504.20 --> 3504.30]  right?
[3504.36 --> 3505.16]  Those promises
[3505.16 --> 3506.78]  that were made
[3506.78 --> 3508.48]  are a sure guarantee
[3508.48 --> 3510.32]  because,
[3510.48 --> 3511.32]  and they've been guaranteed
[3511.32 --> 3512.50]  in the resurrection
[3512.50 --> 3513.02]  of Jesus.
[3514.66 --> 3514.92]  Right?
[3514.96 --> 3515.56]  And so through
[3515.56 --> 3517.08]  the death
[3517.08 --> 3517.76]  and the resurrection
[3517.76 --> 3518.78]  of Jesus Christ,
[3519.28 --> 3520.98]  God is putting an end
[3520.98 --> 3522.64]  to our separation
[3522.64 --> 3523.32]  from Him
[3523.32 --> 3524.94]  and our separation
[3524.94 --> 3526.20]  from our loved ones.
[3527.52 --> 3528.60]  And so here's a way
[3528.60 --> 3529.48]  to think about it.
[3530.20 --> 3530.78]  Christianity
[3530.78 --> 3532.72]  goes from good
[3532.72 --> 3534.40]  to better
[3534.40 --> 3535.92]  to best.
[3537.30 --> 3537.44]  Okay?
[3537.64 --> 3539.40]  What we now have
[3539.40 --> 3540.36]  in our union
[3540.36 --> 3541.48]  with Jesus Christ
[3541.48 --> 3542.08]  through faith
[3542.08 --> 3543.80]  is a new heart,
[3544.66 --> 3545.92]  forgiveness of our sins,
[3545.92 --> 3546.70]  the presence
[3546.70 --> 3547.42]  of the Spirit.
[3547.76 --> 3548.36]  This is good.
[3548.36 --> 3551.24]  Our loved ones
[3551.24 --> 3552.30]  who have died
[3552.30 --> 3553.94]  are now with Jesus
[3553.94 --> 3554.84]  in glory.
[3555.86 --> 3556.50]  That's better.
[3557.64 --> 3558.44]  But when Jesus
[3558.44 --> 3559.24]  comes again
[3559.24 --> 3560.02]  and He brings
[3560.02 --> 3560.52]  paradise
[3560.52 --> 3561.76]  to earth
[3561.76 --> 3563.46]  and we will enjoy
[3563.46 --> 3564.78]  being with our loved ones
[3564.78 --> 3565.92]  without any sorrow
[3565.92 --> 3566.52]  or sin
[3566.52 --> 3567.08]  or sickness
[3567.08 --> 3568.14]  or sadness
[3568.14 --> 3569.34]  or the prospect
[3569.34 --> 3569.92]  of death
[3569.92 --> 3570.50]  and all things
[3570.50 --> 3571.00]  are renewed,
[3571.22 --> 3572.30]  that is best.
[3573.56 --> 3573.72]  Right?
[3573.88 --> 3574.20]  And friends,
[3574.32 --> 3575.32]  the best is yet
[3575.32 --> 3576.12]  to come.
[3576.12 --> 3578.20]  And that is our hope.
[3579.76 --> 3581.18]  So let me pray for us.
[3581.52 --> 3582.12]  Let's pray together.
[3585.38 --> 3586.64]  God of glory,
[3587.00 --> 3587.70]  God of grace,
[3588.74 --> 3589.60]  we remember
[3589.60 --> 3590.92]  before you
[3590.92 --> 3591.84]  today
[3591.84 --> 3594.70]  our loved ones,
[3595.24 --> 3596.90]  those that we miss
[3596.90 --> 3598.54]  and mourn
[3598.54 --> 3599.14]  and grieve.
[3599.14 --> 3601.18]  we thank you,
[3601.28 --> 3601.36]  Lord,
[3601.40 --> 3602.04]  for giving them
[3602.04 --> 3602.52]  to us
[3602.52 --> 3603.12]  to know
[3603.12 --> 3604.32]  and to love
[3604.32 --> 3605.28]  as companions
[3605.28 --> 3607.00]  on our earthly pilgrimage.
[3608.26 --> 3608.86]  And Lord,
[3608.94 --> 3610.32]  in your boundless compassion,
[3610.48 --> 3611.36]  would you comfort us
[3611.36 --> 3611.88]  who mourn
[3611.88 --> 3613.50]  and give us faith
[3613.50 --> 3614.64]  to see in death
[3614.64 --> 3615.32]  the gate
[3615.32 --> 3616.42]  of eternal life,
[3617.12 --> 3617.98]  the resurrection
[3617.98 --> 3619.06]  of our Lord Jesus,
[3619.52 --> 3620.34]  the conquering
[3620.34 --> 3621.76]  of sin
[3621.76 --> 3622.40]  and death
[3622.40 --> 3623.08]  and anything
[3623.08 --> 3623.98]  that would separate us
[3623.98 --> 3624.48]  from you
[3624.48 --> 3625.76]  and from those
[3625.76 --> 3626.24]  we love
[3626.24 --> 3627.72]  so that
[3627.72 --> 3628.76]  we might have
[3628.76 --> 3629.26]  hope
[3629.26 --> 3630.56]  and confidence
[3630.56 --> 3632.24]  here as we
[3632.24 --> 3633.48]  continue our course
[3633.48 --> 3634.10]  in this world
[3634.10 --> 3635.42]  until,
[3635.90 --> 3636.54]  by your call,
[3636.62 --> 3637.36]  we are reunited
[3637.36 --> 3638.00]  with those
[3638.00 --> 3639.04]  who have gone
[3639.04 --> 3639.72]  before us.
[3640.40 --> 3640.76]  And Lord,
[3640.82 --> 3641.72]  we pray that you
[3641.72 --> 3642.70]  would come soon
[3642.70 --> 3644.88]  as the returning king.
[3645.54 --> 3646.26]  We pray this
[3646.26 --> 3647.00]  through Jesus Christ,
[3647.08 --> 3647.46]  our Lord.
[3648.06 --> 3648.44]  Amen.
[3648.44 --> 3648.54]  Amen.
[3648.54 --> 3648.58]  Amen.
[3648.58 --> 3648.60]  Amen.
[3648.60 --> 3648.62]  Amen.
[3648.62 --> 3648.66]  Amen.
[3654.48 --> 3656.48]  Amen.
[3664.48 --> 3665.78]  Please rise
[3665.78 --> 3666.82]  to sing with us.
[3666.82 --> 3687.08]  What gift of grace
[3687.08 --> 3690.20]  is Jesus my Redeemer?
[3690.20 --> 3693.12]  There is no more
[3693.12 --> 3696.12]  for heaven now to give.
[3696.12 --> 3699.24]  He is my joy,
[3699.46 --> 3700.58]  my righteousness
[3700.58 --> 3702.18]  and freedom,
[3703.18 --> 3705.38]  my steadfast love,
[3705.50 --> 3708.88]  my deep and boundless peace.
[3709.30 --> 3711.46]  To this I hope,
[3711.54 --> 3714.14]  my hope is only Jesus,
[3715.48 --> 3718.42]  for my life is holy
[3718.42 --> 3719.82]  now to live.
[3721.36 --> 3722.98]  Oh, I'm strange
[3722.98 --> 3724.18]  and divine,
[3724.18 --> 3725.18]  I can sing.
[3725.18 --> 3726.04]  I can sing.
[3726.14 --> 3727.52]  Oh, it's mine,
[3727.76 --> 3729.22]  yet not I,
[3729.34 --> 3732.78]  but Christ in me.
[3739.18 --> 3740.14]  Nighted.
[3741.18 --> 3744.38]  The night is dark,
[3744.48 --> 3747.12]  but I am not forsaken,
[3747.12 --> 3750.30]  for by my side
[3750.30 --> 3751.18]  the Savior,
[3751.52 --> 3752.80]  He will stay.
[3752.80 --> 3756.26]  I labor on
[3756.26 --> 3757.26]  in weakness
[3757.26 --> 3759.26]  and rejoicing,
[3759.26 --> 3762.00]  for in my need
[3762.00 --> 3764.36]  His power is to stay.
[3765.64 --> 3767.72]  To this I hope,
[3767.92 --> 3771.36]  my shepherd will defend me,
[3771.36 --> 3774.64]  through the deepest valley
[3774.64 --> 3777.00]  He will lead.
[3777.00 --> 3780.46]  Oh, the night has been one,
[3780.46 --> 3781.46]  I guess,
[3781.46 --> 3783.46]  shall overcome,
[3783.46 --> 3785.32]  yet not I,
[3785.32 --> 3789.46]  but the Christ in me.
[3789.46 --> 3798.92]  No fate I dread,
[3798.92 --> 3801.92]  I know I'm forbidden,
[3801.92 --> 3804.92]  the future's sure,
[3804.92 --> 3808.92]  the price it has been paid,
[3808.92 --> 3810.92]  for Jesus bled
[3810.92 --> 3814.42]  and suffered for my pardon,
[3814.42 --> 3817.26]  and He will praise
[3817.26 --> 3819.88]  to go and throw the grave.
[3820.88 --> 3823.04]  To this I hope,
[3823.20 --> 3823.98]  my Savior,
[3823.98 --> 3825.70]  and defeated,
[3827.06 --> 3829.80]  Jesus now and ever
[3829.80 --> 3831.46]  is my queen.
[3832.80 --> 3834.88]  Oh, the chains are released,
[3834.88 --> 3837.26]  I can sing,
[3837.38 --> 3838.56]  I am free,
[3838.88 --> 3840.26]  yet not I,
[3840.26 --> 3843.72]  but the Christ in me.
[3843.72 --> 3844.72]  Oh, the chains are released,
[3844.72 --> 3845.72]  I am free,
[3845.72 --> 3846.72]  but the Lord,
[3846.72 --> 3847.72]  I am free,
[3847.72 --> 3848.72]  and I am free.
[3848.72 --> 3849.72]  I am free,
[3849.72 --> 3850.72]  and I am free.
[3850.72 --> 3851.72]  I am free,
[3851.72 --> 3852.72]  and I am free.
[3852.72 --> 3853.72]  With every breath,
[3853.72 --> 3857.72]  I long to follow Jesus,
[3857.72 --> 3860.18]  for He has said,
[3860.18 --> 3863.18]  that He will bring me home,
[3863.18 --> 3866.18]  and day by day,
[3866.18 --> 3869.18]  I know He will renew me,
[3869.18 --> 3872.92]  until I stand with joy
[3872.92 --> 3875.18]  and voice come.
[3875.18 --> 3877.18]  To this I hope,
[3878.00 --> 3880.44]  my hope is only Jesus,
[3881.70 --> 3886.18]  all the glory evermore to Him.
[3886.18 --> 3889.84]  When the race is complete,
[3889.84 --> 3891.52]  still I live,
[3891.64 --> 3892.84]  shall repeat,
[3893.28 --> 3894.64]  yet not I,
[3894.78 --> 3897.64]  but the Christ in me.
[3898.64 --> 3901.64]  When the race is complete,
[3902.04 --> 3904.76]  yet my lips shall repeat,
[3905.22 --> 3906.64]  yet not I,
[3906.88 --> 3909.94]  but the Christ in me.
[3916.18 --> 3917.32]  Let's pray.
[3917.32 --> 3919.64]  Let's pray.
[3919.64 --> 3920.18]  Let's pray.
[3920.18 --> 3921.04]  Let's pray.
[3921.04 --> 3921.60]  Let's pray.
[3921.60 --> 3922.14]  Let's pray.
[3922.14 --> 3922.52]  Let's pray.
[3922.52 --> 3922.78]  Let's pray.
[3922.78 --> 3923.82]  Let's pray.
[3923.82 --> 3924.28]  Let's pray.
[3924.28 --> 3924.78]  Let's pray.
[3924.78 --> 3925.78]  Let's pray.
[3925.78 --> 3926.88]  Let's pray.
[3926.88 --> 3927.92]  Let's pray.
[3927.92 --> 3929.56]  Our offering this morning
[3929.56 --> 3932.44]  is for M2W2,
[3932.68 --> 3935.26]  which is a prison ministry
[3935.26 --> 3939.98]  that pairs people
[3939.98 --> 3940.76]  to have a relationship
[3940.76 --> 3941.74]  with some of the inmates,
[3942.04 --> 3945.18]  and has had a very successful ministry
[3945.18 --> 3946.02]  for many years.
[3947.40 --> 3948.88]  Be blessed as you give.
[3948.88 --> 3948.94]  Let's pray.
[3948.94 --> 3950.94]  Let's pray.
[3975.18 --> 3980.52]  Let's pray.
[3980.52 --> 3982.52]  Amen.
[4010.52 --> 4012.52]  Amen.
[4040.52 --> 4042.52]  Amen.
[4070.52 --> 4072.52]  Amen.
[4072.52 --> 4074.52]  Amen.
[4074.52 --> 4076.52]  Amen.
[4076.52 --> 4080.92]  We have the privilege now of coming before our Lord in prayer.
[4080.92 --> 4081.86]  Let's pray together.
[4085.14 --> 4093.56]  King of the universe, God of the ages, we bow our hearts before you in worship, for no one else is worthy of our adoration.
[4093.56 --> 4103.98]  We are overwhelmed by your love, knowing that you welcome us with open arms, and so we bring you our deepest needs and longings.
[4104.98 --> 4113.28]  We long for a world where children have their basic needs met, food, shelter, love, and security.
[4114.28 --> 4122.72]  We long for a world where greed is replaced by contentment, where injustice becomes mercy.
[4123.56 --> 4129.80]  We long for a world where conflict is resolved and peace comes to stay.
[4131.00 --> 4142.40]  We long for a world where our illnesses are healed, where we will be not just well, but that we will flourish because of your presence with us.
[4142.40 --> 4150.78]  We pray for those in our midst who are ill, who are grieving, who are lonely.
[4150.78 --> 4156.06]  Those who have things that they're dealing with that nobody knows about.
[4157.42 --> 4163.40]  Lord, will you be with them and give them healing and your grace.
[4164.28 --> 4169.22]  We thank you for the measure of healing that Henny has received from your hand as well.
[4169.22 --> 4172.92]  These, Lord, are the things that we long for.
[4173.92 --> 4178.66]  Above all that, we recognize our deepest need, our need of you.
[4179.88 --> 4186.80]  God, whose gracious love for us embraced that long and lonely journey to the cross,
[4187.60 --> 4193.70]  gather us close to you in these days when again we make that journey in meditation and recollection.
[4193.70 --> 4201.50]  Help us to contemplate again the way taken by our Savior, the false charges against him,
[4202.02 --> 4208.72]  the fear and flight of the disciples, the kiss of betrayal, the crown of thorns, the purple robe.
[4209.68 --> 4218.84]  And in such contemplation, give us courage to face those times in our own lives when he received the same at our hands.
[4218.84 --> 4233.00]  When we are weak, Lord, make us strong.
[4233.74 --> 4237.00]  When hurt and resentful, make us forgiving.
[4238.04 --> 4240.98]  When defeated and discouraged, make us hopeful.
[4242.22 --> 4245.50]  Keep us from asking for mercy without giving it ourselves.
[4245.50 --> 4249.46]  From praying for your kingdom but never working for it.
[4250.56 --> 4254.44]  In this week, deepen our faith by your matchless grace.
[4255.62 --> 4258.98]  Deepen the measure of our gratitude and Christian obedience.
[4260.50 --> 4264.56]  Move us who have so much to share with others who have so little.
[4266.06 --> 4271.80]  Uphold us when we summon our courage to speak out for the alien and stranger within our gates
[4271.80 --> 4275.62]  and for those long denied dignity and freedom.
[4276.68 --> 4280.62]  Guard and guide us through these days of meditation and remembrance.
[4281.88 --> 4286.50]  Guard and guide us through all our days until we come at last to that day
[4286.50 --> 4290.50]  when all our days and journeys will be gathered into your eternity
[4290.50 --> 4292.78]  and we shall be with you forever.
[4293.86 --> 4295.78]  Glory be to you, eternal God,
[4296.52 --> 4299.02]  suffering Savior and comforting Spirit.
[4299.66 --> 4299.92]  Amen.
[4299.92 --> 4300.10]  Amen.
[4301.80 --> 4305.34]  And just a reminder because I didn't mention it earlier,
[4305.56 --> 4307.22]  after the service closes,
[4307.62 --> 4310.40]  everyone is invited for refreshments in the fellowship hall.
[4319.70 --> 4320.62]  Please rise.
[4320.62 --> 4324.18]  And I think another thing to take notice of is next Friday,
[4324.32 --> 4326.32]  not only do we have a Good Friday service at 10,
[4326.40 --> 4328.10]  but then there will be hospital singing.
[4328.10 --> 4332.76]  Next Friday afternoon at 2, 2 o'clock.
