[265.00 → 290.16] Well, good morning.
[290.16 → 291.22] Good morning.
[291.22 → 300.08] And welcome everyone to our service today. We're already, by my calculations, at the midpoint, roughly, of the Lenten season.
[300.30 → 309.86] So as we look ahead to Easter, it's certainly appropriate that today we also celebrate communion and use that to reflect on the miracle of Easter that we're looking forward to.
[310.44 → 319.50] My name is Jake. I'll be leading us through the first part of our service this morning before Pastor Jason leads us in communion and exploring God's words.
[319.50 → 326.96] I have just three announcements before we really start our service, and there are also ones that are in your bulletins.
[327.48 → 336.50] So if you want to look on that as well, but first one, today at 2 p.m., we have the opportunity to join in song at Mountain View Manor.
[336.84 → 348.86] It's at 2 o'clock. And then tonight, 7 p.m., we have the hymn sing opportunity, opportunity to come together and sing some of those old-time hymns that you may know and love.
[348.86 → 356.22] And that'll be a good opportunity tonight. And then lastly, next week, a highlight, always for me, the soup and bun lunch.
[356.68 → 366.90] A great opportunity to get together, break bread, enjoy some company, and have some delicious, interesting, different types of soups that you might normally get.
[367.00 → 372.58] So a great chance for fellowship and exploring culinary opportunities next week.
[372.58 → 378.44] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 107.
[378.44 → 387.58] O give thanks to the Lord, for God is good, for God's steadfast love endures forever.
[388.52 → 393.52] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, for God has redeemed us from trouble.
[394.32 → 400.82] Let us thank the Lord for God's steadfast love, for God's wonderful works to humankind.
[400.82 → 407.24] Let us come before God with thanksgiving and tell of God's deeds with songs of joy.
[408.18 → 409.30] Please join me in prayer.
[413.30 → 418.22] Everlasting God, we gather together knowing you are present among us.
[418.22 → 423.72] Amen.
[430.22 → 440.02] Amen.
[440.02 → 448.12] including us. May we be open to the Spirit in this time. Amen. And now is a
[448.12 → 453.18] good time to stand if you are able and greet those around you.
[470.02 → 499.02] All right. Time to sing together and to lift the name of the Lord
[499.02 → 504.36] through this song and with our hearts and voices we lift your name.

[895.86 → 906.86] Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[910.86 → 916.86] Holy One, we confess that we have failed to live into the covenants you have made with us.
[916.86 → 921.86] We have turned aside from you, from your ways, and sought our own gain.
[921.86 → 925.86] We have ignored those in need among us and fought with our neighbours.
[925.86 → 935.86] We have abandoned our love for you and failed to love one another, loving instead the things of this world, wealth, power, security, notoriety.
[935.86 → 939.86] Forgive us for not living the life you have assured us.
[939.86 → 947.86] Guide us away from the empty promises of the world we have made and into the promise of eternal life in you.
[947.86 → 950.86] Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[950.86 → 955.86] You have been created for good works in Christ Jesus.
[955.86 → 958.86] Remember your created intention.
[958.86 → 960.86] Remember your purpose.
[960.86 → 969.86] Go back to your roots and know God's love and grace and forgiveness have always, always been there.
[969.86 → 971.86] Accept it.
[971.86 → 973.86] Know it in your heart.
[973.86 → 974.86] Know it in your heart.
[974.86 → 979.86] And live into the life Christ has promised you now and through eternity.
[979.86 → 983.86] Let's celebrate that in song with How Firm a Foundation.
[983.86 → 986.86] Talk to each other's
[986.86 → 990.86] and Devon of our hearts.
[990.86 → 994.86] Find ourselves on our prayer.
[994.86 → 996.86] Remember your bless on your god's mind.
[996.86 → 1000.86] We forgive us...
[1000.86 → 1002.86] .
[1002.86 → 1007.86] The second time of your life...
[1007.86 → 1023.96] In his sins of the Lord, in his name for your faith, in his dance and prayer, the world can be saved.
[1023.96 → 1036.16] And in beauty as sin, to you, O man, just to Jesus, God, man.
[1036.16 → 1044.86] No longer be afraid, but I will be with you.
[1044.86 → 1052.66] I am your son, your son, your son, your son, your son.
[1052.66 → 1060.46] I am your son, your son, your son, your son, your son.
[1060.46 → 1067.46] I am your son, your son, your son.
[1067.46 → 1069.46] I am your son.
[1069.46 → 1099.46] 
[1099.46 → 1101.46] I am your son.
[1101.46 → 1102.46] I am your son.
[1102.46 → 1104.46] I am your son.
[1104.46 → 1106.46] I am your son.
[1106.46 → 1107.46] I am your son.
[1107.46 → 1109.46] I am your son.
[1109.46 → 1126.46] I am your son.
[1126.46 → 1134.06] and the grave won't be allege,
[1134.06 → 1145.96] I believe, shall know,
[1145.96 → 1149.96] this is,
[1149.96 → 1151.96] hitless to be great.
[1151.96 → 1171.64] so we come now to the lord's table and as we come let us first confess together what we believe
[1171.64 → 1178.84] as Christians, and so we will use the apostles creed as our profession of faith and let's say
[1178.84 → 1188.12] this out loud together I believe in god the father almighty creator of heaven and earth
[1188.84 → 1198.36] I believe in Jesus Christ his only son our lord who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the
[1198.36 → 1208.44] Virgin Mary he suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified died and was buried he descended to hell
[1209.16 → 1216.60] the third day he rose again from the dead he ascended to heaven and is seated at the right
[1216.60 → 1224.28] hand of god the father almighty from there he will come to judge the living and the dead
[1225.24 → 1233.32] I believe in the Holy Spirit the holy Catholic Church the communion of saints the forgiveness
[1233.32 → 1238.68] of sins the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting
[1242.28 → 1251.32] and so as we come to this meal it is actually a family meal that's one of the reasons I like
[1251.32 → 1257.64] this once a month when we come together, and we call it family worship Sunday and part of that is because
[1257.64 → 1266.12] that is because this is a family meal if this is our father's table our heavenly father's table, and it's
[1266.12 → 1274.04] because of our older brother Jesus that we can come and that we can actually take part of this sit at
[1274.04 → 1280.92] the table and enjoy his table and enjoy his good gifts where we come, and we taste his grace and
[1280.92 → 1287.08] experience his forgiveness and his goodness to us and because this is a family meal we can only come
[1287.08 → 1295.80] we can only come to this table through faith in Jesus the the the son of god who died on the cross for us
[1295.80 → 1303.16] who rose again in order to bring us into a relationship with god as his sons and daughters
[1303.16 → 1311.72] and so that's why this meal is for Christians it is for all of those who through faith in Jesus Christ his
[1311.72 → 1320.36] death and resurrection have been made children of god and if you are a child of god, and you've expressed
[1320.36 → 1325.64] that through baptism or profession of faith then this table is for you and Jesus bids you to come
[1326.28 → 1333.96] and to eat with him if you today are not yet a Christian if you have not yet been baptized then at this time
[1333.96 → 1344.76] the meal is not yet for you, but it is an opportunity for you to come before god who is the heavenly father and to
[1344.76 → 1353.24] consider his welcome to you and his forgiveness of sins and his willingness to adopt you into his family
[1353.24 → 1359.96] and if you would like to explore that if you're interested in learning more about Christianity
[1359.96 → 1365.80] please talk to the person who brought you along, or you can come and talk with me as well and so now
[1365.80 → 1371.16] let's let's come to god in prayer and ask for his blessing upon this meal let's pray together
[1373.32 → 1380.04] our heavenly father we ask that now you would send your Holy Spirit so that this bread and this
[1380.04 → 1386.68] cup may be for us the body and blood of our lord Jesus Christ and as we come to your table would you
[1387.40 → 1399.64] prepare our hearts to feed on you by faith and to fellowship with you to experience tangibly your love
[1399.64 → 1405.48] for us and your forgiveness of all of our sins lord would you bless this meal for the glory of your name
[1405.48 → 1412.60] and would you nourish your children by it, we ask in Christ's name amen
[1415.88 → 1421.80] the lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks to god he
[1421.80 → 1427.48] broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me
[1427.48 → 1436.60] the same way after supper he took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood for as
[1436.60 → 1443.56] often as you drink it you do it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread, and you drink
[1443.56 → 1453.96] this cup you proclaim the lord's death until he comes again and so let's say our communion liturgy together
[1453.96 → 1461.64] brothers and sisters lift your hearts we are his people
[1464.92 → 1472.52] let us proclaim the mystery of faith Christ has died Christ is risen Christ will come again
[1473.32 → 1477.16] Christ our passover has been sacrificed for us hallelujah
[1477.16 → 1485.40] brothers and sisters these are the gifts of god for you his people, and he invites you to come and
[1485.40 → 1492.20] feed on him in your hearts by faith with great thanksgiving knowing and trusting that Jesus died
[1492.76 → 1499.88] to forgive you for all of your sins and to reconcile you to god your heavenly father so may I now ask our
[1499.88 → 1506.20] elders to come forward and help me distribute the elements and while that is being done as the elements
[1506.20 → 1513.32] are coming along please just hold them and after everyone is served we will eat together and this is a
[1513.32 → 1528.44] time also for you to pray to meditate upon god's love for you and his forgiveness of your sins

[1926.34 → 1928.34] Let's drink together.

[2046.34 → 2050.34] So, in the middle of the night, and I think it's at 2 o'clock, the clock immediately went

[2065.34 → 2068.34] I was thinking about time, and I have this.
[2068.34 → 2069.34] Do you know what this is?
[2069.34 → 2070.34] A clock.
[2070.34 → 2071.34] A clock.
[2071.34 → 2072.34] What was the picture of it?
[2072.34 → 2073.34] An owl.
[2073.34 → 2074.34] An owl, yeah.
[2074.34 → 2075.34] You know who made this?
[2075.34 → 2076.34] My son, Abram.
[2076.34 → 2077.34] Yeah.
[2077.34 → 2081.34] He made this in school, and he gave it to me for Christmas.
[2081.34 → 2082.34] Yeah.
[2082.34 → 2083.34] Is that a real clock?
[2083.34 → 2084.34] Is that a real clock?
[2084.34 → 2085.34] It's a real clock.
[2085.34 → 2087.34] I took out the battery because it ticks too loudly.
[2087.34 → 2088.34] But, hey.
[2088.34 → 2092.34] Actually, I have to tell me what's in the clock.
[2092.34 → 2097.34] Yeah, without the numbers, you have to know that there's actually numbers that go all the
[2097.34 → 2098.34] way around.
[2098.34 → 2099.34] Sounds like quick numbers.
[2099.34 → 2102.34] And it's a, I don't know.
[2102.34 → 2103.34] Shh.
[2103.34 → 2106.34] So this is a type of clock that doesn't have the numbers.
[2106.34 → 2111.34] But if you know, this is a okay, we'll talk about this later.
[2111.34 → 2112.34] Talk to your parents.
[2112.34 → 2113.34] I don't know.
[2113.34 → 2114.34] Okay.
[2114.34 → 2115.34] So this is the clock.
[2115.34 → 2116.34] Hey, guys.
[2116.34 → 2117.34] So, I was thinking about time.
[2117.34 → 2119.34] I was thinking about clocks.
[2119.34 → 2123.34] And it made me think of this passage in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[2123.34 → 2127.34] I want to read a passage, and there are lots of different words.
[2127.34 → 2130.34] And I want you to act out the words that you hear.
[2130.34 → 2131.34] Okay?
[2131.34 → 2133.34] I want you to act out the words that you hear.
[2133.34 → 2134.34] Are you ready?
[2134.34 → 2135.34] Okay.
[2135.34 → 2142.34] There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven.
[2142.34 → 2143.34] Okay, ready?
[2143.34 → 2146.34] A time to be born.
[2146.34 → 2148.34] That's, okay, this one, this part's hard.
[2148.34 → 2152.34] A time to be born and a time to die.
[2152.34 → 2153.34] Okay, ready?
[2153.34 → 2155.34] A time to plant.
[2155.34 → 2156.34] Like planting a seed.
[2156.34 → 2157.34] Let's see it.
[2157.34 → 2158.34] Okay.
[2158.34 → 2159.34] Plant.
[2159.34 → 2161.34] And a time to uproot.
[2161.34 → 2162.34] Okay.
[2162.34 → 2164.34] Time to uproot.
[2164.34 → 2165.34] All right.
[2165.34 → 2166.34] Ready?
[2166.34 → 2167.34] Keep going.
[2167.34 → 2168.34] A time to kill.
[2168.34 → 2169.34] All right.
[2169.34 → 2171.34] I didn't think this through.
[2171.34 → 2172.34] Okay.
[2172.34 → 2173.34] Okay.
[2173.34 → 2174.34] She's killing you.
[2174.34 → 2175.34] Okay.
[2175.34 → 2177.34] And a time to heal.
[2177.34 → 2180.34] So just think about the words.
[2180.34 → 2182.34] A time to weep.
[2182.34 → 2183.34] Weep.
[2183.34 → 2184.34] Cry.
[2184.34 → 2186.34] A time to laugh.
[2186.34 → 2192.34] A time to mourn, which is also a word for crying.
[2192.34 → 2195.34] And a time to dance.
[2195.34 → 2196.34] Yeah.
[2196.34 → 2197.34] Okay.
[2197.34 → 2199.34] A time to scatter stones.
[2199.34 → 2201.34] A time to gather them up.
[2201.34 → 2203.34] A time to embrace.
[2203.34 → 2204.34] It's like giving a hug.
[2204.34 → 2205.34] Like that.
[2205.34 → 2208.34] And a time to refrain.
[2208.34 → 2211.34] That means not do something.
[2211.34 → 2214.34] A time to search.
[2214.34 → 2217.34] And a time to give up.
[2217.34 → 2219.34] A time to keep.
[2219.34 → 2221.34] A time to throw away.
[2221.34 → 2223.34] A time to tear.
[2223.34 → 2225.34] Let's see tear.
[2225.34 → 2227.34] And a time to mend.
[2227.34 → 2230.34] A time to be silent.
[2230.34 → 2233.34] A time to speak.
[2233.34 → 2237.34] A time to love.
[2237.34 → 2238.34] A time to hate.
[2238.34 → 2239.34] A time for war.
[2239.34 → 2240.34] A time for peace.
[2240.34 → 2241.34] So what's God saying?
[2241.34 → 2245.34] That there is a time for everything that happens in the world.
[2245.34 → 2249.34] And God is in charge of time.
[2249.34 → 2250.34] All the time.
[2250.34 → 2253.34] Everything that happens in this world is in God's hands.
[2253.34 → 2256.34] And there was a time when Jesus came.
[2256.34 → 2260.34] There was a time when God sent his son Jesus to live.
[2260.34 → 2261.34] To die.
[2261.34 → 2264.34] And there was a time for him to rise again.
[2264.34 → 2266.34] And you know what now is?
[2266.34 → 2271.34] Now is the time for us to love God and to follow him.
[2271.34 → 2273.34] With the help of the Holy Spirit.
[2273.34 → 2274.34] Okay?
[2274.34 → 2276.34] So God is holding the whole church?
[2276.34 → 2277.34] He's holding.
[2277.34 → 2278.34] There's a kid's song.
[2278.34 → 2280.34] It says he's got the whole world in his hands.
[2280.34 → 2281.34] Do you know that?
[2281.34 → 2282.34] Yeah.
[2282.34 → 2287.34] So God has the whole world in his hands.
[2287.34 → 2288.34] Okay?
[2288.34 → 2289.34] And all time is in his hands.
[2289.34 → 2291.34] The word is in his hands.
[2291.34 → 2294.34] Well, it's anthropomorphic.
[2294.34 → 2295.34] But...
[2296.34 → 2297.34] Okay.
[2297.34 → 2298.34] Let's just pray.
[2298.34 → 2299.34] His hands.
[2299.34 → 2300.34] God is a spirit.
[2300.34 → 2301.34] We can't see him.
[2301.34 → 2303.34] He does not have a body like us.
[2303.34 → 2306.34] But we think about how we have hands.
[2306.34 → 2310.34] In the same way, God has the whole world in his hands as well.
[2310.34 → 2311.34] Okay.
[2311.34 → 2315.34] We'll talk about that next time.
[2315.34 → 2316.34] Let's pray.
[2316.34 → 2317.34] Let's pray.
[2317.34 → 2318.34] Okay?
[2318.34 → 2319.34] Please pray with me.
[2319.34 → 2321.34] Father, we thank you that you are...
[2322.34 → 2325.34] You have all time, all the world in your hands.
[2325.34 → 2327.34] And there's a time for all things.
[2327.34 → 2330.34] And Lord, would this be the time that you would help us to draw close to you.
[2330.34 → 2332.34] To follow you as your children.
[2332.34 → 2333.34] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2333.34 → 2334.34] Amen.
[2334.34 → 2335.34] All right.
[2335.34 → 2336.34] Thanks for joining me.
[2336.34 → 2338.34] So you can go to your class now.
[2338.34 → 2341.34] And I think you're going to have a choir rehearsal.
[2341.34 → 2342.34] Sunday school.
[2342.34 → 2343.34] Go ahead.
[2343.34 → 2344.34] Bye.
[2344.34 → 2345.34] Bye.
[2345.34 → 2347.34] Watch your step.
[2347.34 → 2349.34] You have something in your pocket.
[2349.34 → 2350.34] Okay.
[2350.34 → 2351.34] Come on down.
[2351.34 → 2352.34] You have a key key.
[2352.34 → 2353.34] Okay.
[2353.34 → 2354.34] Okay.
[2360.34 → 2388.34] All right.
[2388.34 → 2389.34] So good morning.
[2389.34 → 2395.34] So we are in the third week of a series that we've been doing.
[2395.34 → 2399.34] And it's a series that you may find a little bit unusual if you haven't heard about this.
[2399.34 → 2402.34] But it's called Remember Your Death.
[2402.34 → 2411.34] Actually, we are doing a series where we are considering death and how God would have us to live in light of death.
[2411.34 → 2418.34] And what we've been discovering as we've looked at different passages of Scripture is that to contemplate
[2418.34 → 2424.34] death as a Christian is really to contemplate life.
[2424.34 → 2430.34] And to be prepared for death as a Christian is actually to be prepared to live.
[2430.34 → 2432.34] To live well in this world.
[2432.34 → 2434.34] To live to God's glory.
[2434.34 → 2440.34] And this also is the reality in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[2440.34 → 2443.34] And that's where we will look today.
[2443.34 → 2446.34] So, please turn there with me in the Bibles.
[2446.34 → 2448.34] You have one in front of you.
[2448.34 → 2451.34] Please open your Bibles to the book of Ecclesiastes.
[2451.34 → 2453.34] So, this is in the Old Testament.
[2453.34 → 2456.34] If you go to Psalms, then it's Proverbs.
[2456.34 → 2457.34] Keep going right.
[2457.34 → 2460.34] And you'll find Ecclesiastes.
[2460.34 → 2472.34] So, we will be in chapter 9.
[2472.34 → 2475.34] This is on page 502 in your pew Bible.
[2475.34 → 2480.34] So, Ecclesiastes chapter 9.
[2480.34 → 2487.34] And we will be reading verses 1 through 10.
[2487.34 → 2491.34] So, Ecclesiastes 9 verses 1 through 10.
[2491.34 → 2492.34] Alright.
[2492.34 → 2494.34] So, let's...
[2494.34 → 2497.34] Please listen, and I will read it for us.
[2497.34 → 2506.34] So, I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands.
[2506.34 → 2509.34] But no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.
[2509.34 → 2511.34] All share a common destiny.
[2511.34 → 2513.34] The righteous and the wicked.
[2513.34 → 2514.34] The good and the bad.
[2514.34 → 2516.34] The clean and the unclean.
[2516.34 → 2519.34] Those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
[2519.34 → 2522.34] As it is with a good man, so with the sinner.
[2522.34 → 2526.34] As it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid of the sin.
[2526.34 → 2528.34] Those who are afraid of them.
[2528.34 → 2529.34] Or to take them.
[2529.34 → 2532.34] This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun.
[2532.34 → 2535.34] The same destiny overtakes all.
[2535.34 → 2538.34] The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil.
[2538.34 → 2541.34] And there is madness in their hearts while they live.
[2541.34 → 2543.34] And afterward, they join the dead.
[2543.34 → 2546.34] Anyone who is among the living has hope.
[2546.34 → 2551.34] And even a live dog is better off than a dead lion.
[2551.34 → 2554.34] For the living know that they will die.
[2554.34 → 2555.34] But the dead know nothing.
[2555.34 → 2558.34] They have no further reward.
[2558.34 → 2560.34] And even the memory of them is forgotten.
[2560.34 → 2564.34] Their love, their hate, and their jealousy have long since vanished.
[2564.34 → 2568.34] Never again will they have a part of anything that happens under the sun.
[2568.34 → 2572.34] Go, eat your food with gladness.
[2572.34 → 2574.34] Drink your wine with a joyful heart.
[2574.34 → 2578.34] For it is now that God favours what you do.
[2578.34 → 2582.34] Be Always clothed in white and always anoint your head with oil.
[2582.34 → 2586.34] Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love.
[2586.34 → 2590.34] All the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun.
[2590.34 → 2592.34] All your meaningless days.
[2592.34 → 2596.34] For this is your law in life, in your toilsome labour under the sun.
[2596.34 → 2601.34] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all of your might.
[2601.34 → 2609.34] For in the grave where you are going, there is neither working nor planning, nor knowledge nor wisdom.
[2609.34 → 2611.34] This is the word of the Lord.
[2611.34 → 2616.34] Let us pray and ask for God's blessing upon his word.
[2616.34 → 2617.34] Let's pray together.
[2617.34 → 2625.34] Our Father, please bless us now as we hear with eager expectation what you would have to say to us.
[2625.34 → 2631.34] And how you would mould us and strengthen us and feed us through your word.
[2631.34 → 2636.34] And may it be done, O Lord, to the glory of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2636.34 → 2637.34] Amen.
[2638.34 → 2643.34] And so this morning, this passage is going to teach us three things about death.
[2643.34 → 2650.34] And also what it looks like to live life in light of death or in the face of death.
[2650.34 → 2653.34] So first we're going to see the complaint of death.
[2653.34 → 2656.34] Secondly, the enjoyment of life.
[2656.34 → 2658.34] And then third, the love of God.
[2658.34 → 2660.34] Okay, three things.
[2660.34 → 2664.34] The complaint of death, the enjoyment of life, and the love of God.
[2664.34 → 2671.34] So first, King Solomon, who many would say is the one who wrote the book of Ecclesiastes,
[2671.34 → 2673.34] he comes, and he brings a complaint.
[2673.34 → 2681.34] Now if you read through Ecclesiastes, he kind of brings complaints to us as the reader.
[2681.34 → 2684.34] And here in chapter 9, he brings a complaint.
[2684.34 → 2687.34] So we see this in verses 2 to 3.
[2687.34 → 2689.34] Let's look at verses 2 to 3.
[2689.34 → 2690.34] It says,
[2690.34 → 2697.34] All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean,
[2697.34 → 2700.34] those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
[2700.34 → 2703.34] As it is with the good, so with the sinful.
[2703.34 → 2709.34] As it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.
[2709.34 → 2712.34] This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun.
[2712.34 → 2717.34] The same destiny overtakes all.
[2717.34 → 2724.34] Now when it says the same destiny overtakes all, that is of course, death.
[2724.34 → 2729.34] Death is something that we all face.
[2729.34 → 2735.34] As one writer has said, at the end of the day we can run all the marathons,
[2735.34 → 2739.34] we can eat all the kale till the cows come home.
[2739.34 → 2743.34] But let's not kid ourselves, none of us is getting out of here alive.
[2745.34 → 2748.34] I thought it was kind of, yeah, thank you, at least one person.
[2748.34 → 2751.34] It's kind of funny, but it is also true.
[2752.34 → 2760.34] And it happens that, no, this happens, this death comes to all of us, no matter who you are.
[2760.34 → 2764.34] All share a common destiny.
[2764.34 → 2768.34] And then he lists all these different kinds of people.
[2768.34 → 2774.34] Some act fairly in the world, while others act selfishly.
[2774.34 → 2780.34] Some are religious, and they pay attention to God, while others do not.
[2780.34 → 2784.34] Some are very careful in how they speak the truth.
[2784.34 → 2787.34] Well, you cannot even trust the words of other people.
[2787.34 → 2794.34] And so he sees that people are different in their character and in the way they live.
[2794.34 → 2796.34] But that's not his complaint.
[2796.34 → 2798.34] Not so much that people are different.
[2798.34 → 2804.34] His complaint is that though people are different, the same thing happens to them all.
[2804.34 → 2810.34] In the end, everyone dies no matter who they are.
[2810.34 → 2815.34] And that is what seems a great evil to Solomon.
[2815.34 → 2820.34] He says, this is the evil in everything that happens under the sun.
[2820.34 → 2823.34] The same destiny overtakes them all.
[2823.34 → 2830.34] And you know, when we think about maybe our own cultural moment, what's going on in our culture,
[2830.34 → 2838.34] and what people believe about death, we feel the same way as Solomon does when he wrote like 4,000 years ago.
[2838.34 → 2847.34] Right? Most of us believe that it is not right that no matter who you are, how you live, that everyone comes to the same conclusion.
[2847.34 → 2859.34] Right? It doesn't make cosmic sense to us that sometimes the good die young, and someone who is cruel and greedy lives a long life.
[2859.34 → 2866.34] Right? We know it happens, but it doesn't seem right.
[2866.34 → 2871.34] Even people who maybe don't believe in an afterlife or don't believe in karma or anything like that,
[2871.34 → 2884.34] they have a sense of justice, and they know that how you live should matter for your destiny, whether how you live.
[2884.34 → 2889.34] And so, but yet, the Bible tells us that death doesn't care about any of that.
[2889.34 → 2895.34] Right? Death doesn't care whether you lived a good life or a virtuous life, or whether you do not.
[2895.34 → 2906.34] Death is a heartless power that plows through the human race, and it doesn't stop for a second to get to know us.
[2906.34 → 2911.34] All right? It doesn't try to find out what you are like.
[2911.34 → 2917.34] It doesn't care if you are the sweetest, kindest kindergarten teacher or a violent criminal.
[2917.34 → 2922.34] It doesn't take into consideration how you lived your life or what your love of God looks like.
[2922.34 → 2929.34] And that is the great complaint about death.
[2929.34 → 2935.34] But he goes on. He doesn't stop there because Solomon, he's seeking wisdom.
[2935.34 → 2942.34] Like, as he looks at life under the sun, he sees that all these people, they all have the same destiny.
[2942.34 → 2953.34] So how do we live? And the question is, if death comes to us all, if we all have the same destiny, no matter what our lives look like, how then should we live?
[2953.34 → 2957.34] Is there any wisdom about how we should live our lives?
[2957.34 → 2962.34] Okay? So this is where on the second point here, the enjoyment of life.
[2962.34 → 2966.34] Now, he's going to answer this question in the next few verses.
[2966.34 → 2970.34] First, we need to notice what he doesn't say.
[2970.34 → 2978.34] He does not say that since the righteous and the sinner both die, therefore you might as well be a sinner.
[2978.34 → 2981.34] He doesn't say that. Right?
[2981.34 → 2984.34] So I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Pirates of the Caribbean.
[2984.34 → 2987.34] Right? What is their toast as pirates?
[2987.34 → 2989.34] Take what you can.
[2991.34 → 2993.34] Give nothing back.
[2993.34 → 2996.34] Okay. That's okay. I watched too many movies.
[2996.34 → 3002.34] Take what you can. Give nothing back. They're pirates. Okay?
[3002.34 → 3005.34] That is not Ecclesiastes.
[3005.34 → 3009.34] That's not the answer. That's not the wisdom for how we should live life.
[3009.34 → 3015.34] So, how does God say we should live?
[3015.34 → 3018.34] In light of the reality of death.
[3018.34 → 3024.34] And the answer is to open our eyes to seeking joy.
[3024.34 → 3029.34] To open our eyes to embracing the gifts that God has given us in this life.
[3029.34 → 3031.34] That is the answer.
[3031.34 → 3034.34] And so we see this in this passage in verses 7 to 10.
[3034.34 → 3037.34] So in verse 7, Solomon begins with a command.
[3037.34 → 3041.34] Go, eat your food with gladness.
[3041.34 → 3044.34] Drink your wine with a joyful heart.
[3044.34 → 3054.34] You know, and as you read through the book of Ecclesiastes, this is like the sixth time that Solomon exhorts us to enjoy life.
[3054.34 → 3061.34] He says, eat, drink, be joyful, enjoy God's good gifts.
[3061.34 → 3065.34] Aim to enjoy yourself as much as you can in this life.
[3065.34 → 3067.34] Why?
[3067.34 → 3070.34] Why should we do that?
[3070.34 → 3078.34] And the answer is, it's because nobody can go through this life only ever with enjoyment.
[3078.34 → 3083.34] In other words, there are going to be valleys.
[3083.34 → 3087.34] There are going to be dark periods of life.
[3087.34 → 3088.34] There's going to be suffering.
[3088.34 → 3091.34] There's going to be clouds in your life.
[3091.34 → 3092.34] There's going to be miseries.
[3092.34 → 3094.34] There's going to be distress.
[3094.34 → 3099.34] And nobody in here can ever really completely bypass those realities of life.
[3099.34 → 3100.34] You can't.
[3100.34 → 3103.34] And sometimes they will be heavy upon you.
[3103.34 → 3105.34] Sometimes they will be light.
[3105.34 → 3108.34] Sometimes they will last just a few days.
[3108.34 → 3110.34] Sometimes they will last many years.
[3110.34 → 3113.34] They will come and they will go.
[3113.34 → 3120.34] And so what should you do when you have a sort of reprieve from the suffering of this world?
[3120.34 → 3123.34] You should aim to enjoy yourself.
[3123.34 → 3124.34] Right?
[3124.34 → 3125.34] You should aim to laugh.
[3125.34 → 3126.34] You should smile.
[3126.34 → 3128.34] You should rejoice.
[3128.34 → 3134.34] Listen to what C.S. Lewis writes here in his book, The Problem of Pain.
[3134.34 → 3136.34] This is what he says.
[3136.34 → 3146.34] The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world.
[3146.34 → 3152.34] But joy, pleasure, and merriment, he has scattered broadcast.
[3152.34 → 3157.34] We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun and some ecstasy.
[3157.34 → 3159.34] A few moments of happy love.
[3159.34 → 3160.34] A landscape.
[3160.34 → 3161.34] A symphony.
[3161.34 → 3164.34] A merry meeting with our friends.
[3164.34 → 3166.34] A bath or a football match.
[3166.34 → 3171.34] Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns,
[3171.34 → 3177.34] but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.
[3177.34 → 3185.34] You know, he's saying, God doesn't want us to find our happiness and security in this life and in the things of the world.
[3185.34 → 3189.34] He wants us to only find our happiness and security in him alone.
[3189.34 → 3195.34] But he does give us these things to enjoy on our journey of life.
[3195.34 → 3200.34] He calls them pleasant inns, where you, you know, you stay and have a reprieve along the way.
[3200.34 → 3208.34] And so when we enjoy some of these things of life, this is not a type of hedonism, right?
[3208.34 → 3213.34] Which is just the philosophy of seeking pleasure for pleasure's sake.
[3213.34 → 3214.34] Right?
[3214.34 → 3219.34] Solomon is not just saying, seek pleasure, which by itself will lead to ruin.
[3219.34 → 3226.34] But rather we are to seek pleasure, not as an end in itself, but as a way of seeking God.
[3226.34 → 3232.34] To enjoy the good things of life as we live for God's glory.
[3232.34 → 3236.34] So notice what it says here in the second part of verse seven.
[3236.34 → 3244.34] Go eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do.
[3244.34 → 3251.34] And so what Solomon is saying here is that first and foremost, is that God has given you this world.
[3251.34 → 3256.34] He has made it with glory.
[3256.34 → 3262.34] And despite the entrance of sin into the world, there are many glories in this world because he made it.
[3262.34 → 3268.34] And it would be wrong to not enjoy his creation.
[3268.34 → 3271.34] And so as you enjoy his creation, right?
[3271.34 → 3280.34] And as you enjoy his creation as a Christian, receiving it with Thanksgiving as a gift from God, God has approved of that.
[3280.34 → 3281.34] God has approved of what you do.
[3281.34 → 3282.34] Right?
[3282.34 → 3285.34] God has given you water and air.
[3285.34 → 3288.34] He has given you mountains to ski on.
[3288.34 → 3290.34] He has given you good food.
[3290.34 → 3291.34] He has given you friendship.
[3291.34 → 3297.34] He has given you sun in the sky and a beach to lie on.
[3297.34 → 3298.34] You know?
[3298.34 → 3301.34] Why should you not enjoy them?
[3301.34 → 3305.34] And should you not enjoy that he enjoys you enjoying them?
[3305.34 → 3306.34] Right?
[3306.34 → 3311.34] God takes pleasure in you enjoying the good things of life.
[3311.34 → 3312.34] Right?
[3312.34 → 3314.34] Imagine like a teacher.
[3314.34 → 3317.34] So I was thinking of Paul as a piano teacher.
[3317.34 → 3318.34] Right?
[3318.34 → 3320.34] He teaches someone to play the piano.
[3320.34 → 3323.34] And that student goes and plays the piano beautifully.
[3323.34 → 3329.34] Does the teacher not receive joy from seeing that student perform?
[3329.34 → 3330.34] Yes.
[3330.34 → 3332.34] Thank you.
[3332.34 → 3334.34] We talked about this before.
[3334.34 → 3335.34] Right?
[3335.34 → 3338.34] That's the way it is with God.
[3338.34 → 3344.34] He has given us this world, and we enjoy his gifts in this world to his glory.
[3344.34 → 3348.34] And he approves of that because they are his gifts.
[3348.34 → 3355.34] And he takes pleasure when we find pleasure in the good things that he gives us.
[3355.34 → 3358.34] So eat and drink.
[3358.34 → 3362.34] But interestingly Solomon wants us to do something else as well.
[3362.34 → 3365.34] He wants us to look good and smell good.
[3365.34 → 3369.34] This wasn't a personal note I don't think.
[3369.34 → 3372.34] But here this is what he says.
[3372.34 → 3373.34] Verse 8.
[3373.34 → 3376.34] Be Always clothed in white.
[3376.34 → 3378.34] And always anoint your head with oil.
[3378.34 → 3384.34] So if you ever needed a scripture passage about how to dress.
[3384.34 → 3386.34] This is it.
[3386.34 → 3390.34] Not only does God make the world delicious.
[3390.34 → 3391.34] Right?
[3391.34 → 3393.34] And giving us food and drink to enjoy.
[3393.34 → 3396.34] But he dresses up the world in beauty.
[3396.34 → 3401.34] And we know we could do a study of beauty throughout the Bible.
[3401.34 → 3403.34] And see that God makes much of beauty.
[3403.34 → 3408.34] And the new heavens and the new earth is going to be beautiful.
[3408.34 → 3411.34] And as part of the way that God has made us.
[3411.34 → 3413.34] We like things that look nice.
[3413.34 → 3414.34] Don't we?
[3414.34 → 3415.34] Right?
[3415.34 → 3420.34] We like having often flowers.
[3420.34 → 3422.34] The one Sunday.
[3422.34 → 3426.34] Often I think Cora and others.
[3426.34 → 3428.34] They bring flowers here.
[3428.34 → 3430.34] And we love it.
[3430.34 → 3431.34] It's beautiful.
[3431.34 → 3433.34] And it brightens our worship service.
[3433.34 → 3434.34] Right?
[3434.34 → 3439.34] We appreciate things that look nice.
[3439.34 → 3440.34] We clean our houses.
[3440.34 → 3441.34] We paint them.
[3441.34 → 3443.34] We try to dress nicely.
[3443.34 → 3447.34] Because God likes things that look nice too.
[3447.34 → 3450.34] And these white garments that he's talking about.
[3450.34 → 3451.34] They're quite interesting.
[3451.34 → 3456.34] Because heroes would wear white garments in the ancient Near East.
[3456.34 → 3458.34] In that culture.
[3458.34 → 3459.34] In a victory parade.
[3459.34 → 3461.34] You're going to have a victory parade.
[3461.34 → 3462.34] You wear white.
[3462.34 → 3465.34] In fact, also slaves when they were freed.
[3465.34 → 3467.34] Would put on white garments.
[3467.34 → 3470.34] People would wear white garments as a sign of style.
[3470.34 → 3472.34] When we look at the book of Revelation.
[3472.34 → 3474.34] How are people dressed?
[3474.34 → 3475.34] In white.
[3475.34 → 3479.34] And so, just to say you want to look nice.
[3479.34 → 3480.34] And putting oil on your head.
[3480.34 → 3483.34] Was a sign that you're making yourself look good.
[3483.34 → 3484.34] Right?
[3484.34 → 3485.34] Oils.
[3485.34 → 3486.34] Like putting these creams on your skin.
[3486.34 → 3488.34] My wife does this.
[3488.34 → 3490.34] Do you all put creams on your skin?
[3490.34 → 3492.34] Some of you might.
[3492.34 → 3493.34] So I go to shoppers.
[3493.34 → 3496.34] And I buy these little jars of cream that she asked for.
[3496.34 → 3498.34] And it costs a fortune.
[3498.34 → 3501.34] But I don't dare complain.
[3501.34 → 3504.34] Because then she can quote Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 8.
[3504.34 → 3506.34] And she's right.
[3506.34 → 3507.34] God approves of it.
[3507.34 → 3508.34] So what can I say?
[3508.34 → 3513.34] So we're told to enjoy the gifts of food and beauty.
[3513.34 → 3517.34] And there's also something really important also that he wants us to enjoy.
[3517.34 → 3520.34] Specifically, he says in verse 9.
[3520.34 → 3521.34] Your spouse.
[3521.34 → 3523.34] This is what it says in verse 9.
[3523.34 → 3527.34] Enjoy life with your wife whom you love.
[3527.34 → 3531.34] Well now, this also means the flip side is also true.
[3531.34 → 3534.34] So when he says, enjoy life with your wife whom you love.
[3534.34 → 3536.34] It would also apply then to the wives.
[3536.34 → 3539.34] Enjoy life with your husband whom you love.
[3539.34 → 3541.34] So what is he saying here?
[3541.34 → 3546.34] He's saying that one of the greatest gifts that you can receive in marriage.
[3546.34 → 3549.34] Is an enjoyable marriage.
[3549.34 → 3556.34] The sad reality of the fallen world is that marriage.
[3556.34 → 3559.34] There are marriages that exist that are miserable.
[3559.34 → 3564.34] And we all, I mean, we all experience that to some degree.
[3564.34 → 3565.34] We're all sinners.
[3565.34 → 3566.34] We're all sinners.
[3566.34 → 3572.34] And if you are particularly experiencing hardship in your marriage, you know, come talk to me.
[3572.34 → 3574.34] And maybe there's counselling.
[3574.34 → 3576.34] We can talk together.
[3576.34 → 3581.34] But to enjoy marriage is a rare thing indeed.
[3581.34 → 3583.34] And it is a great gift.
[3583.34 → 3588.34] And this is such an important verse because you do not want to be on your deathbed.
[3588.34 → 3594.34] And realize that enjoying your wife was the thing that you really wanted to spend your life doing.
[3594.34 → 3596.34] But so many other things got in the way.
[3596.34 → 3599.34] Pursuit of career or money or whatever else.
[3599.34 → 3602.34] You do not want to find out too late.
[3602.34 → 3609.34] That enjoying life with your wife or your husband is a good gift from God.
[3609.34 → 3613.34] And I love how it says to enjoy your wife.
[3613.34 → 3619.34] He doesn't say provide for your wife or take care of your wife or anything else he could have said.
[3619.34 → 3622.34] He says enjoy your wife.
[3622.34 → 3624.34] Play together.
[3624.34 → 3625.34] Talk together.
[3625.34 → 3626.34] Laugh together.
[3626.34 → 3627.34] Go on dates.
[3627.34 → 3628.34] Share intimacy.
[3628.34 → 3629.34] Have fun.
[3629.34 → 3631.34] Whatever that looks like for you.
[3633.34 → 3637.34] Okay, so what is the final thing we're to enjoy in life?
[3637.34 → 3639.34] Well, we are to work hard.
[3639.34 → 3641.34] Okay, so verse 10.
[3641.34 → 3645.34] He says, whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all of your might.
[3645.34 → 3646.34] Right?
[3646.34 → 3647.34] Do it with all of your strength.
[3647.34 → 3649.34] Do it with everything you have.
[3649.34 → 3656.34] For in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
[3656.34 → 3657.34] Right?
[3657.34 → 3661.34] Once you die and go to the grave, your time on earth is done.
[3661.34 → 3663.34] So you need to use it well.
[3663.34 → 3665.34] You need to work hard.
[3665.34 → 3668.34] Whatever you do, you need to do it with all of your might.
[3668.34 → 3669.34] You need to do it well.
[3669.34 → 3675.34] And it's to say, you know, I have a certain amount of time in this life that God has given me.
[3675.34 → 3677.34] And God has also given me certain gifts.
[3677.34 → 3681.34] And I am going to serve the Lord with all of my might.
[3681.34 → 3684.34] That is the kind of life I want to live.
[3684.34 → 3686.34] Whether it's in my work, my vocation.
[3686.34 → 3688.34] I'm doing it for the Lord.
[3688.34 → 3689.34] Whatever it is.
[3689.34 → 3690.34] Right?
[3690.34 → 3694.34] Preparing spreadsheets or doing dishes or whatever it is.
[3694.34 → 3697.34] I'm going to do it well for God's glory.
[3697.34 → 3699.34] And I'm going to use my gifts.
[3699.34 → 3700.34] I'm going to serve in the church.
[3700.34 → 3702.34] And I'm going to work for God's kingdom.
[3702.34 → 3705.34] Because this is what he would have me do.
[3705.34 → 3710.34] And working hard, working well brings satisfaction.
[3710.34 → 3717.34] So the joy that Solomon speaks of comes from working hard.
[3717.34 → 3720.34] It's so good to work hard.
[3720.34 → 3721.34] Right?
[3721.34 → 3723.34] It feels great when you work hard.
[3723.34 → 3728.34] And if you don't work hard, you're probably not going to feel that sense of satisfaction.
[3728.34 → 3731.34] Because God has ordered it that way.
[3731.34 → 3734.34] Okay, and so to summarize the second point here.
[3734.34 → 3738.34] The way that God wants us to live, we're facing the realities of death.
[3738.34 → 3741.34] We complain that death comes to everyone.
[3741.34 → 3742.34] It doesn't matter how they live.
[3742.34 → 3743.34] We're all going to die.
[3743.34 → 3744.34] How do we then live?
[3744.34 → 3747.34] Do we just go live a life of a pirate?
[3747.34 → 3748.34] Take what you can.
[3748.34 → 3749.34] Give nothing back.
[3749.34 → 3751.34] That's not what the Bible says.
[3751.34 → 3752.34] How should we live?
[3752.34 → 3755.34] Enjoy the good things that God has given us.
[3755.34 → 3758.34] There's going to be mountain peaks.
[3758.34 → 3759.34] There's going to be valleys in life.
[3759.34 → 3760.34] There's going to be hard times.
[3760.34 → 3765.34] And when good things come, you receive them as a gift of God.
[3765.34 → 3766.34] And you enjoy them.
[3766.34 → 3770.34] And God takes pleasure in you enjoying his good gifts.
[3770.34 → 3772.34] That's how he calls us to live.
[3775.34 → 3777.34] So here's the question for us this morning.
[3777.34 → 3779.34] That's kind of a way of application.
[3779.34 → 3781.34] Are you enjoying God?
[3781.34 → 3787.34] Are you enjoying the good things that God has given you?
[3787.34 → 3791.34] Are you enjoying your food?
[3791.34 → 3793.34] Are you enjoying your wine?
[3793.34 → 3795.34] If you're able to drink.
[3795.34 → 3798.34] Are you enjoying your spouse?
[3798.34 → 3799.34] Your children?
[3799.34 → 3800.34] Are you enjoying your work?
[3800.34 → 3802.34] I mean, work is hard.
[3802.34 → 3806.34] But are you doing it to God's glory and trying to enjoy what you can?
[3806.34 → 3807.34] Right?
[3807.34 → 3809.34] Are you enjoying being outside?
[3809.34 → 3812.34] Enjoying, you know, under the sun in God's good creation?
[3812.34 → 3813.34] Right?
[3813.34 → 3815.34] Because these are his gifts to you.
[3815.34 → 3819.34] And so sometimes, you know, we're so, you know, when I struggle with this personally,
[3819.34 → 3821.34] like I sometimes struggle with joy.
[3822.34 → 3825.34] But this is what God would have us enjoy.
[3825.34 → 3826.34] He says, go, enjoy.
[3826.34 → 3827.34] It's a command.
[3827.34 → 3831.34] So when you think about that, am I really enjoying the good things that God has given me?
[3831.34 → 3834.34] Knowing that God takes pleasure in that.
[3834.34 → 3835.34] Okay.
[3835.34 → 3845.34] So now, lastly, there's a third thing that this passage tells us about living in the face of death and knowing and trusting in the love of God.
[3845.34 → 3847.34] Or this is what it is.
[3847.34 → 3850.34] It is to know and trust in the love of God for us.
[3850.34 → 3851.34] That's how we live.
[3851.34 → 3860.34] And this is important because another of the great evils of death is that death tries to tell us that God is not the best.
[3860.34 → 3861.34] And this is what it is.
[3861.34 → 3862.34] And this is what it is.
[3862.34 → 3863.34] It is what it is that God tries to tell us that God is not loving.
[3863.34 → 3864.34] Okay, I'll say that again.
[3864.34 → 3874.34] One of the great evils of death is that death tries to tell us that God is not loving.
[3875.34 → 3881.26] Now, you know, the Bible, it says in places like Psalm 19, Romans chapter 1,
[3882.04 → 3886.66] that if you want to learn about what God is like, who God is, what he's like,
[3886.96 → 3893.26] you can look at the world that he has made, and you can see that God is powerful and wise.
[3894.02 → 3898.94] Right? I mean, God made this world. He sustains the world. He orders the world.
[3899.14 → 3902.38] God must be powerful, and he must be wise.
[3902.38 → 3911.48] Just as a painting reveals the qualities of a painter, God's world speaks about him, who he is.
[3912.18 → 3916.82] But now, suppose you have a friend, and your friend comes to you and says,
[3916.94 → 3923.58] when I look at the world, I think there must be a God, but does this God love me?
[3925.70 → 3929.98] That's the question. Does this God love me?
[3929.98 → 3936.04] When I look at the world, I can find some evidence that maybe God is loving.
[3936.90 → 3942.58] But I also, when I look at the world, I might find some evidence that God perhaps is not loving,
[3943.10 → 3944.60] or that he doesn't care.
[3945.82 → 3949.84] So listen to what Solomon says here in verse 1, back in verse 1 in our passage.
[3949.84 → 3951.94] He says,
[3951.94 → 3956.80] So I reflected on all this, right, everything that happens under the sun in God's creation,
[3957.58 → 3963.08] and concluded that the righteous and the wise, what they do, are in God's hands,
[3963.34 → 3967.60] but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them.
[3967.60 → 3975.08] And what this says is, you look at creation, and you find out that God is powerful and wise.
[3975.20 → 3982.62] Everything is in God's hands, but you're not going to be sure whether God is loving or hateful.
[3982.62 → 3991.14] So let's suppose your friend, who asks this question, let's say, you know, just pick something tragic,
[3991.26 → 3996.16] and I don't mean to like, you know, point, make, make someone feel particularly upset by what I choose,
[3996.24 → 3997.12] but I'm just going to choose something.
[3997.62 → 4002.52] Suppose her mother has recently died in a car accident, or just something, something awful, right?
[4002.80 → 4003.72] Some death has occurred.
[4003.72 → 4008.52] How is she supposed to feel about that?
[4008.74 → 4013.66] Or what should she conclude about who God is from this tragedy happening in her life?
[4014.14 → 4019.00] If we use that as evidence of the way God feels towards us,
[4020.00 → 4022.80] we might conclude, we would probably conclude,
[4023.18 → 4028.14] that either God does not exist, or that he doesn't really care about us.
[4028.14 → 4034.08] And so when we face that heartless power of death,
[4034.78 → 4039.62] and we are still in mourning, and we are angry at this evil under the sun,
[4040.08 → 4043.84] that doesn't care who we are, that doesn't care about the people who are precious to us,
[4043.94 → 4047.44] we begin to ask, is that what God is like?
[4050.94 → 4052.84] That is the great evil of death.
[4053.62 → 4057.80] It makes us doubt and question God's goodness and his love.
[4057.80 → 4062.16] Death is the enemy, and when death happens, it makes us wonder,
[4062.50 → 4063.90] well, is God the enemy?
[4065.16 → 4067.70] And so we need to go beyond Ecclesiastes,
[4068.14 → 4071.78] because though what it says is true, it is only partial.
[4071.92 → 4073.24] It only gives us part of the story.
[4074.14 → 4078.48] And appearances are more deceiving in this case than in other cases.
[4079.14 → 4082.34] And there is only one place where you can get the answer,
[4082.70 → 4084.88] that God is not only powerful and wise,
[4084.88 → 4088.60] but that he is also good and loving.
[4089.40 → 4091.66] And that is in the person of Jesus Christ.
[4092.78 → 4095.76] Okay, we must look at the person of Jesus.
[4096.60 → 4098.56] And there are two reasons for that.
[4099.34 → 4100.82] The first reason is,
[4101.24 → 4103.74] because Jesus himself died.
[4105.02 → 4106.22] Jesus himself died.
[4106.22 → 4112.46] How can I know that God is good when death causes so much senseless suffering and sorrow?
[4113.00 → 4115.88] It is because God himself took on flesh,
[4116.08 → 4118.06] and he became a man just like us.
[4118.72 → 4122.38] And if anyone deserves to live,
[4122.98 → 4123.66] it was Jesus.
[4124.76 → 4128.46] If anyone deserved a different outcome than death,
[4128.56 → 4129.96] because of who he is,
[4130.14 → 4132.04] the way he lived his life,
[4132.04 → 4134.90] if there is justice at all,
[4135.62 → 4137.30] it would be Jesus,
[4138.00 → 4139.40] who would have a different outcome.
[4140.18 → 4142.46] But Jesus came into this broken world,
[4142.60 → 4144.02] where death reigns,
[4144.12 → 4146.20] and he willingly entered into it,
[4146.22 → 4148.48] and he suffered death himself,
[4148.70 → 4150.32] on the cross for us.
[4151.24 → 4152.50] And so when we ask,
[4152.82 → 4154.58] how can I know that God is loving?
[4154.58 → 4158.64] We may not understand why the sorrows of life happen,
[4158.72 → 4159.90] where God is leading things,
[4160.04 → 4161.76] but the one thing I do know,
[4162.48 → 4163.64] for sure,
[4164.46 → 4165.72] is that he is loving.
[4166.36 → 4169.28] Because even though he didn't have to be born and die,
[4169.84 → 4171.92] he did so because of his love for us.
[4173.34 → 4174.06] So that's, friends,
[4174.10 → 4176.02] that's the first evidence that God loves us,
[4176.28 → 4179.42] because he sent Jesus to come and die for us.
[4179.78 → 4180.82] But that's not enough.
[4180.88 → 4181.38] It's not only,
[4181.42 → 4183.20] it's not enough that God only suffered death,
[4183.20 → 4186.42] because the second thing we learn when we look to Jesus,
[4187.30 → 4190.64] is that Jesus rose again to life.
[4192.14 → 4192.62] And, friends,
[4192.76 → 4194.32] Jesus' own resurrection
[4194.32 → 4196.58] was the first fruits,
[4196.66 → 4197.44] the Bible says,
[4197.50 → 4198.72] of what God is going to do
[4198.72 → 4200.10] in this whole creation.
[4201.00 → 4203.06] And if you hold fast to Jesus,
[4203.94 → 4205.98] this one who died for you,
[4206.06 → 4206.60] who suffered,
[4206.70 → 4207.68] and he rose again,
[4208.34 → 4210.26] then what God did for Jesus,
[4210.36 → 4211.14] when he raised him,
[4211.20 → 4212.48] he will do for you as well.
[4213.20 → 4213.84] Right?
[4213.98 → 4215.52] God raised Jesus from the dead.
[4216.12 → 4218.06] And his indestructible life,
[4218.12 → 4219.24] he gives to you
[4219.24 → 4221.32] when you put your faith and trust in him.
[4222.02 → 4222.42] Friends,
[4222.46 → 4223.48] that is the hope of the gospel.
[4224.14 → 4224.56] Right?
[4224.60 → 4226.90] And that is the love that God has for us.
[4229.38 → 4231.62] So not only does God give us the grace
[4231.62 → 4233.74] to enjoy all of these good gifts
[4233.74 → 4235.40] that he's given us in life,
[4235.40 → 4239.70] but we also can enjoy God himself forever.
[4239.70 → 4243.42] We can find our truest happiness and security in God
[4243.42 → 4246.00] because of the life and death
[4246.00 → 4248.80] and the resurrection of Jesus.
[4248.80 → 4250.74] Let's pray together.
[4254.18 → 4254.62] Lord,
[4254.68 → 4255.96] we thank you for your word
[4255.96 → 4258.78] and for the encouragement that it gives us.
[4259.88 → 4261.88] Thank you that you have not only defeated
[4261.88 → 4263.36] this enemy of death
[4263.36 → 4265.56] and promised us life eternal
[4265.56 → 4267.50] through faith in the finished work of Christ,
[4267.72 → 4269.84] but you have given us so many gifts
[4269.84 → 4270.92] to enjoy in this life.
[4270.92 → 4273.06] And so help us, Lord,
[4273.38 → 4275.30] to hold fast to you
[4275.30 → 4277.44] and to live and to do everything
[4277.44 → 4279.52] for the glory of God.
[4280.16 → 4281.36] In Jesus' name we pray.
[4281.62 → 4281.90] Amen.
[4285.56 → 4286.40] Let's all stand
[4286.40 → 4288.26] and we'll sing our song of response.
[4291.94 → 4294.04] And I believe part of life is,
[4294.32 → 4295.90] and God's gift to us is music.
[4296.04 → 4297.18] And I enjoy music
[4297.18 → 4299.62] and that was great.
[4299.62 → 4301.12] What the pastor said
[4301.12 → 4302.56] about teaching students
[4302.56 → 4305.62] and enjoying when they perform.
[4306.84 → 4308.66] And so enjoying music,
[4308.82 → 4310.98] I want to bring a little bit of a twist
[4310.98 → 4312.76] to Bless the Assurance today, okay?
[4313.04 → 4314.42] So a little bit of a different rhythm,
[4314.80 → 4315.80] but you'll catch on
[4315.80 → 4317.68] because you're musical, and you're quick.
[4318.08 → 4318.40] All right?
[4318.54 → 4320.44] So it goes a little bit like this.
[4329.62 → 4329.78] Okay?
[4329.88 → 4331.18] We're just adding a little in the middle,
[4331.62 → 4332.86] give it a bit of a gospel feel.
[4333.20 → 4334.02] Here we go together.
[4334.02 → 4334.08] Here we go together.
[4334.08 → 4347.52] Bless the Assurance,
[4347.52 → 4349.52] Jesus is mine.
[4349.52 → 4351.88] Jesus is mine.
[4352.52 → 4356.52] Oh, what a false taste
[4356.52 → 4360.52] of glory divine.
[4360.52 → 4364.52] Heir of salvation,
[4366.52 → 4369.52] purchase of God.
[4369.52 → 4382.52] This is my story.
[4382.52 → 4387.52] This is my song.
[4387.52 → 4392.52] Praise to my Saviour.
[4392.52 → 4393.52] Praise to my Saviour.
[4393.52 → 4396.68] All the day long.
[4396.68 → 4401.20] This is my story.
[4401.20 → 4405.52] This is my song.
[4405.52 → 4410.02] Praise to my Saviour.
[4410.02 → 4414.84] All the day long.
[4414.84 → 4419.84] Perfect submission,
[4419.84 → 4424.84] Perfect delight.
[4424.84 → 4428.84] Visions of rapture,
[4428.84 → 4433.84] The burst of my sight.
[4433.84 → 4437.84] Angels descending,
[4437.84 → 4441.84] Right from above.
[4441.84 → 4444.84] Echoes of mercy.
[4444.84 → 4446.84] Echoes of mercy.
[4446.84 → 4448.84] Whispers of love.
[4448.84 → 4450.84] This is my story.
[4450.84 → 4452.84] This is my song.
[4452.84 → 4454.84] This is my song.
[4454.84 → 4456.84] Praise to my Saviour.
[4456.84 → 4458.84] This is my song.
[4458.84 → 4460.84] Praise to my Saviour.
[4460.84 → 4462.84] Praise to my Saviour.
[4462.84 → 4464.84] All the day long.
[4464.84 → 4466.84] This is my song.
[4466.84 → 4467.84] Praise to my Saviour.
[4467.84 → 4475.84] IRA quite e
[4475.84 → 4478.84] This is my song.
[4478.84 → 4484.84] This snowy
[4484.84 → 4488.84] Perfect submission.
[4488.84 → 4492.48] submission
[4492.48 → 4497.02] all is that rest
[4497.02 → 4501.22] I am my senior
[4501.22 → 4506.06] and happy and blessed
[4506.06 → 4510.56] Watching and waiting
[4510.56 → 4514.90] looking above
[4514.90 → 4522.50] Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
[4523.00 → 4531.38] This is my story, this is my soul.
[4532.50 → 4539.56] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[4539.56 → 4548.30] This is my story, this is my soul.
[4550.22 → 4557.38] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[4561.38 → 4562.94] Thank you, you may be seated.
[4569.56 → 4577.28] Our offerings will be received at this time.
[4577.28 → 4585.60] And this week's cause is going to support Delta Christian School, an organization that was founded by this congregation many, many years ago.
[4585.68 → 4586.76] I think it's over 60 now.
[4587.48 → 4590.18] And it's been supported by this congregation for years and years.
[4590.34 → 4593.50] So we have our opportunity to continue that support this morning.
[4593.50 → 4623.48] Thank you.
[4623.50 → 4627.36] architecture
[4627.36 → 4629.36] Amen.
[4657.36 → 4659.36] Amen.
[4687.36 → 4689.36] Amen.
[4717.36 → 4719.36] Amen.
[4719.36 → 4721.36] Amen.
[4721.36 → 4723.36] Amen.
[4723.36 → 4725.36] Amen.
[4725.36 → 4727.36] Amen.
[4727.36 → 4731.36] Please join me in prayer.
[4731.36 → 4737.36] Sojourning God,
[4737.36 → 4741.36] as we move through the halfway point of Lent,
[4741.36 → 4743.36] journeying toward the cross at Calvary,
[4743.36 → 4745.36] we remember where we have gone astray
[4745.36 → 4747.36] on our own journey of faith.
[4747.36 → 4749.36] At times we have taken you for granted.
[4749.36 → 4753.36] We have taken the church for granted.
[4753.36 → 4755.36] We have assured ourselves that we are good people
[4755.36 → 4757.36] and that we do good things.
[4757.36 → 4759.36] Remind us that the journey
[4759.36 → 4761.36] is as important as the destination.
[4761.36 → 4763.36] We are called to help others
[4763.36 → 4765.36] in this world, not only to know
[4765.36 → 4767.36] you, but to know your love
[4767.36 → 4769.36] through our love of them.
[4769.36 → 4771.36] Call us to truly
[4771.36 → 4773.36] love our neighbour,
[4773.36 → 4775.36] in which we take notice of their needs,
[4775.36 → 4777.36] understand the systems
[4777.36 → 4779.36] and structures in place that continue to
[4779.36 → 4781.36] oppress and harm, and work for justice
[4781.36 → 4783.36] in this world.
[4783.36 → 4785.36] For it is this life that matters.
[4785.36 → 4787.36] It is in this life that we measure
[4787.36 → 4789.36] ourselves, whether we have lived
[4789.36 → 4791.36] into your ways.
[4791.36 → 4793.36] It is in this life that we have the opportunity
[4793.36 → 4795.36] to practice hospitality,
[4795.36 → 4797.36] welcome the stranger, lift the poor,
[4797.36 → 4801.36] work for justice, and pursue peace.
[4801.36 → 4803.36] God of healing, we seek your light
[4803.36 → 4805.36] to shine upon those who are facing
[4805.36 → 4807.36] surgery or awaiting test results,
[4807.36 → 4811.36] or whose healing process is slower than expected.
[4811.36 → 4813.36] We pray especially for those we know
[4813.36 → 4817.36] are suffering from the devastating effects of cancer,
[4817.36 → 4819.36] and pray for your healing intervention
[4819.36 → 4821.36] for those facing treatments.
[4821.36 → 4825.36] Give strength and comfort to those whose treatments
[4825.36 → 4827.36] have been unsuccessful and now face different,
[4827.36 → 4829.36] more intense options.
[4829.36 → 4831.36] Dispel the darkness for those who may doubt
[4831.36 → 4835.36] and wrestle with the hard questions of life.
[4835.36 → 4837.36] We pray for healing for a SIFE.
[4837.36 → 4839.36] Even as doctors work to understand,
[4839.36 → 4841.36] we know you already do understand,
[4841.36 → 4843.36] and we pray for your intervention with her.
[4843.36 → 4849.36] We pray for a speedy recovery for Jackie Van Run
[4849.36 → 4851.36] after her surgery that she can soon resume
[4851.36 → 4853.36] her regular activities.
[4853.36 → 4859.36] We also hold up before you the Colin and Telstra families
[4859.36 → 4861.36] with the recent loss of Sonia,
[4861.36 → 4865.36] and more recently the loss of her sister Evelyn.
[4865.36 → 4869.36] Be near these families as they grieve these losses,
[4869.36 → 4872.36] and grant them the peace of knowing
[4872.36 → 4876.36] that you remain in your hands.
[4876.36 → 4880.36] Merciful God, we continue to pray for an end to war.
[4880.36 → 4882.36] The ongoing war in Ukraine,
[4882.36 → 4885.36] the war in Gaza which continues to threaten to spread
[4885.36 → 4887.36] across the Middle East,
[4887.36 → 4889.36] the anarchy in Haiti with gang violence
[4889.36 → 4892.36] effectively running the government ineffective.
[4892.36 → 4894.36] May you grant wisdom and intention
[4894.36 → 4897.36] to the leaders involved in or with ability
[4897.36 → 4899.36] to influence these conflicts,
[4899.36 → 4901.36] that there may be a path to peace formed
[4901.36 → 4903.36] for all these regions.
[4903.36 → 4907.36] Empowering God, we pray for Delta Christian School
[4907.36 → 4910.36] that it will continue in its decades-long mission
[4910.36 → 4913.36] to help equip children for a Christ-entered life
[4913.36 → 4915.36] within this community.
[4915.36 → 4918.36] Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.
[4918.36 → 4921.36] Help us to be effective servants to you,
[4921.36 → 4924.36] and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory
[4924.36 → 4926.36] and advance your kingdom.
[4926.36 → 4930.36] We offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate name
[4930.36 → 4932.36] of Jesus, the light of the world.
[4932.36 → 4934.36] Amen.
[4934.36 → 4935.36] All right.
[4935.36 → 4946.36] Well, let's all stand.
[4946.36 → 4948.36] We'll go out with God's blessing upon us,
[4948.36 → 4951.36] and then we'll conclude with the final song.
[4951.36 → 4956.36] Again, today, 2 o'clock, Mountain View Manor singing,
[4956.36 → 4959.36] and then tonight, back here at 7 o'clock,
[4959.36 → 4960.36] we're going to have a hymn sing.
[4960.36 → 4963.36] Just continue to praise God on this Lord's Day.
[4963.36 → 4966.36] And after the service, please do join us for time of fellowship
[4966.36 → 4969.36] and coffee in the fellowship hall through the doors.
[4969.36 → 4974.36] Now, receive the Lord's blessing.
[4974.36 → 4978.36] May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[4978.36 → 4981.36] brought back from the dead, our Lord Jesus,
[4981.36 → 4985.36] that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good
[4985.36 → 4987.36] for doing his will.
[4987.36 → 4990.36] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him,
[4990.36 → 4993.36] through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4993.36 → 4994.36] Amen.

[5017.36 → 5024.36] The people of God, from this dwelling take note.
[5024.36 → 5027.36] The supper has been dined.
[5027.36 → 5036.40] O now be extended, the fruits of this service in all who believe.
[5036.40 → 5042.86] The seed of Christ teaching, receptive souls reaching,
[5043.22 → 5049.32] shall blossom in action for God and for all.
[5049.68 → 5055.68] Your grace shall incite us, your love shall unite us,
[5055.68 → 5062.18] to work for your kingdom and answer your call.
[5062.18 → 5069.20] With praise and thanksgiving to God ever living,
[5069.62 → 5075.38] the task of our everyday life we will face.

[5081.66 → 5087.90] embracing God's children, the whole human race.

[5094.50 → 5100.16] unite us as one in this life that we share.
[5100.16 → 5106.66] Then may all go living, with praise and thanksgiving,
[5106.66 → 5113.80] give honour to Christ and his name that us bear.
