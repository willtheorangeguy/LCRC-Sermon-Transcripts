[324.46 → 325.32] Good morning.
[325.32 → 328.08] And welcome everyone to our service here today.
[328.08 → 334.08] When I was preparing for this service I looked back at some of my old files as I do.
[334.08 → 337.08] Please don't judge me for that, but that's what I do.
[337.08 → 342.08] And I think the last time I had the privilege of standing up here was sometime in July.
[342.08 → 351.08] And it was a warm summer Sunday, and we were concerned with the lack of rain and the impact that would have on forest fires and agriculture.
[351.08 → 354.08] So yeah, fast-forward today and not so much, right?
[354.08 → 363.08] So what a difference a little over three months can make and isn't it amazing still to see the change in seasons that our Lord has put in place.
[363.08 → 374.08] But regardless, we have a warm, relatively warm and dry sanctuary to be in, and it's great to gather and spend some time in praise and worship of our God.
[374.08 → 376.08] My name is Jake Iron.
[376.08 → 384.08] I'll be leading the first portion of this service before Pastor Jason takes over and leads us in exploring deeper into the book's book of Romans.
[384.08 → 390.08] I don't have a lot of announcements outside what's already in your bulletin.
[390.08 → 394.08] So I would just encourage everyone check that out for things like the soup and bun lunch and that kind of thing.
[394.08 → 397.08] So we'll start with our call to worship.
[397.08 → 401.08] And that call to worship comes this morning from Psalm 138.
[401.08 → 404.08] I will give you thanks with all my heart.
[404.08 → 407.08] I will sing your praise before the heavenly beings.
[407.08 → 414.08] I will bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your constant love and truth.
[414.08 → 419.08] You have exalted your name and your promise above everything else.
[419.08 → 422.08] On the day I called, you answered me.
[422.08 → 425.08] You increased strength within me.
[425.08 → 428.08] Please join me in prayer.
[428.08 → 438.08] Light of Christ, awaken us this hour to the glory of your presence in our midst.
[438.08 → 448.08] Shine among us in such a way that the darkness without and within may be pushed back, such that we might truly see what is real.
[448.08 → 452.08] Help us to recognize our sin for what it is.
[452.08 → 458.08] Enable us to behold the world as you created it to be, as you created us to be.
[458.08 → 464.08] Empower us to move from darkness to light, from sin to new life.
[464.08 → 470.08] May your light within us shine through into worship this day and all days.
[470.08 → 477.08] This we pray in the name of the word made flesh, the light which is the light of all people, Jesus Christ.
[477.08 → 478.08] Amen.
[478.08 → 481.08] So we're going to spend some time in praise.
[481.08 → 487.08] But before that, it's a good time to, if you are able to stand up and greet those around you.
[487.08 → 489.08] Mara head, so I've noticed many times, I mean, we see what happens all day.

[1082.48 → 1089.88] We have a scripture reading that I'd like to share with you
[1089.88 → 1090.96] And it's from Jeremiah
[1090.96 → 1092.74] Chapter 7
[1092.74 → 1094.74] First 15 verses
[1094.74 → 1096.98] In your pew Bibles
[1096.98 → 1098.60] I think that's on page 570
[1112.48 → 1119.10] Jeremiah 7
[1119.10 → 1123.84] This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[1123.84 → 1126.54] Stand at the gate of the Lord's house
[1126.54 → 1128.56] And there proclaim this message
[1128.56 → 1130.66] Hear the word of the Lord
[1130.66 → 1131.88] All you people of Judah
[1131.88 → 1134.26] Who come through these gates to worship the Lord
[1134.26 → 1136.22] This is what the Lord Almighty
[1136.22 → 1138.06] The God of Israel says
[1138.06 → 1140.84] Reform your ways and your actions
[1140.84 → 1142.72] And I will let you live in this place
[1142.72 → 1145.62] Do not trust in deceptive words and say
[1145.62 → 1147.28] This is the temple of the Lord
[1147.28 → 1148.54] The temple of the Lord
[1148.54 → 1149.74] The temple of the Lord
[1149.74 → 1152.72] If you really change your ways and your actions
[1152.72 → 1154.66] And deal with each other justly
[1154.66 → 1156.96] If you do not oppress the foreigner
[1156.96 → 1158.94] The fatherless or the widow
[1158.94 → 1161.82] And do not shed innocent blood in this place
[1161.82 → 1166.56] And if you do not follow other gods to your own harm
[1166.56 → 1168.98] Then I will let you live in this place
[1168.98 → 1172.58] In the land I gave your ancestors forever and ever
[1172.58 → 1174.40] But look
[1174.40 → 1177.72] You are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless
[1177.72 → 1180.14] Will you steal and murder
[1180.14 → 1182.22] Commit adultery and perjury
[1182.22 → 1183.94] Burn incense to bail
[1183.94 → 1186.00] And follow other gods you have not known
[1186.00 → 1188.52] And then come and stand before me in this house
[1188.52 → 1189.72] Which bears my name
[1189.72 → 1191.30] And say we are safe
[1191.30 → 1193.92] Safe to do all these detestable things
[1193.92 → 1197.42] Has this house which bears my name
[1197.42 → 1199.34] Become a den of robbers to you
[1199.34 → 1201.22] But I have been watching
[1201.22 → 1202.40] Declares the Lord
[1202.40 → 1205.52] Go now to the place in Shiloh
[1205.52 → 1207.84] Where I first made a dwelling for my name
[1207.84 → 1209.64] And see what I did to it
[1209.64 → 1211.86] Because of the wickedness of my people Israel
[1211.86 → 1214.66] While you were doing all these things
[1214.66 → 1215.42] Declares the Lord
[1215.42 → 1217.96] I spoke to you again and again
[1217.96 → 1219.48] But you did not listen
[1219.48 → 1221.22] I called you
[1221.22 → 1222.68] But you did not answer
[1222.68 → 1224.06] Therefore
[1224.06 → 1225.52] What I did to Shiloh
[1225.52 → 1228.68] I will now do to the house that bears my name
[1228.68 → 1230.34] The temple you trust in
[1230.34 → 1233.20] The place I gave to you and your ancestors
[1233.20 → 1235.52] I will thrust you from my presence
[1235.52 → 1238.22] Just as I did all your fellow Israelites
[1238.22 → 1240.24] The people of Ephraim
[1240.24 → 1246.54] Please join me in a prayer of confession
[1246.54 → 1251.98] Lord
[1251.98 → 1254.18] Though you should guide us
[1254.18 → 1256.16] We inform ourselves
[1256.16 → 1258.44] Though you should rule us
[1258.44 → 1260.20] We control ourselves
[1260.20 → 1262.30] Though you should fulfill us
[1262.30 → 1264.22] We console ourselves
[1264.22 → 1266.60] We think your truth too high
[1266.60 → 1268.40] Your will too hard
[1268.40 → 1270.36] Your power too remote
[1270.36 → 1272.22] Your love too free
[1272.22 → 1273.84] But they are not
[1273.84 → 1275.46] And without them
[1275.46 → 1277.28] We are of all people
[1277.28 → 1278.26] Most miserable
[1278.26 → 1281.26] Now heal our confused minds
[1281.26 → 1282.10] With your word
[1282.10 → 1284.38] Heal our divided wills
[1284.38 → 1285.28] With your law
[1285.28 → 1287.72] Heal our troubled consciences
[1287.72 → 1288.80] With your love
[1288.80 → 1290.98] Heal our anxious hearts
[1290.98 → 1292.00] With your presence
[1292.00 → 1294.44] All for the sake of your son
[1294.44 → 1295.60] Who loved us
[1295.60 → 1297.28] And gave himself for us
[1297.28 → 1298.42] Amen
[1298.42 → 1304.06] The gospel of Christ speaks to us
[1304.06 → 1305.58] Of the pardon we may have
[1305.58 → 1306.60] Through the finished work
[1306.60 → 1307.62] Of Jesus Christ
[1307.62 → 1309.28] With these words from Titus 2
[1309.28 → 1312.06] For the grace of God has appeared
[1312.06 → 1314.36] Bringing salvation for all people
[1314.36 → 1316.24] Training us to renounce
[1316.24 → 1318.24] Ungodliness and worldly passions
[1318.24 → 1320.14] And to live self-controlled
[1320.14 → 1322.96] Upright and godly lives
[1322.96 → 1324.02] In this present age
[1324.02 → 1326.24] Waiting for our blessed hope
[1326.24 → 1328.04] The appearing of the glory
[1328.04 → 1328.96] Of our great God
[1328.96 → 1330.30] And Saviour Jesus Christ
[1330.30 → 1332.20] Who gave himself for us
[1332.20 → 1333.48] To redeem us
[1333.48 → 1334.76] From all lawlessness
[1334.76 → 1336.76] And to purify for himself
[1336.76 → 1339.14] A people for his own possession
[1339.14 → 1340.98] Who are zealous for good works
[1340.98 → 1342.80] In him we are forgiven
[1342.80 → 1344.18] Amen
[1344.18 → 1347.78] On the basis of the gospel of Christ
[1347.78 → 1349.10] We may be assured
[1349.10 → 1350.68] That our sins are forgiven
[1350.68 → 1351.74] For the sake of Christ
[1351.74 → 1353.82] Let's celebrate that in song
[1353.82 → 1354.48] Starting with
[1354.48 → 1355.92] You are my all in all
[1355.92 → 1361.00] We'd like to sing this song
[1361.00 → 1361.42] In a round
[1361.42 → 1362.44] Yes please rise
[1362.44 → 1364.70] Just kind of divide yourself
[1364.70 → 1365.80] In half
[1365.80 → 1368.64] We'll be singing
[1368.64 → 1370.64] The first verse all together
[1370.64 → 1372.56] And then this side
[1372.56 → 1374.00] We'll be singing the chorus
[1374.00 → 1374.58] Which is
[1374.58 → 1376.50] Jesus Lamb of God
[1376.50 → 1377.86] Worthy is your name
[1377.86 → 1379.86] Jesus Lamb of God
[1379.86 → 1380.86] Worthy is your name
[1380.86 → 1383.10] So we will start singing that
[1383.10 → 1383.98] And the other side
[1383.98 → 1385.28] We'll sing verse 1 again
[1385.28 → 1386.60] And then we'll just continue
[1386.60 → 1387.30] Okay
[1387.30 → 1390.06] Hope that's clear
[1390.06 → 1392.26] Andrew and Jackie
[1392.26 → 1393.94] Will help that side
[1393.94 → 1395.20] And Asia and I
[1395.20 → 1396.42] Will sing with this side
[1396.42 → 1408.86] You are my strength
[1408.86 → 1413.10] You are my strength
[1413.10 → 1414.86] And I am weak
[1414.86 → 1416.46] You are my strength

[1582.24 → 1582.50] all
[1582.50 → 1583.90] hear
[1583.90 → 1584.38] the
[1584.38 → 1585.84] great
[1585.84 → 1587.30] ring
[1587.30 → 1588.10] Your
[1588.10 → 1589.42] Lift
[1589.48 → 1590.50] and
[1590.54 → 1591.56] Jury
[1591.56 → 1592.52] Law
[1592.52 → 1592.94] Hit
[1592.94 → 1593.52] AUF
[1593.52 → 1594.84] hundred
[1594.84 → 1599.84] How great your name.
[1601.36 → 1604.84] When the stars in shining light,
[1605.74 → 1609.64] I think how the maker's might.
[1610.14 → 1613.94] When I'm in the hands of power,
[1614.42 → 1618.30] then I know how small we are.
[1618.30 → 1622.30] How great your name.
[1622.30 → 1627.26] Lord, I know that all year,
[1627.92 → 1631.18] I'm great your name.
[1632.14 → 1636.10] Yours the name of God's name,
[1636.58 → 1640.30] and so that you know the earth,
[1640.60 → 1644.46] I'm great your name.
[1645.64 → 1649.76] Who are we that we should share?
[1649.76 → 1654.04] In your wealth and tender care,
[1654.50 → 1657.76] raised to the land of God's love,
[1658.76 → 1662.38] proud with all new reversal,
[1663.14 → 1666.76] how great your name.
[1667.92 → 1671.64] Lord, I know that all year,
[1671.64 → 1675.76] how great your name.
[1676.84 → 1680.98] Yours the name of rapture's blood,
[1681.38 → 1685.18] as a land in all the earth,
[1685.56 → 1689.88] how great your name.
[1689.88 → 1692.68] May be spirit.
[1708.56 → 1709.94] So the children are dismissed
[1709.94 → 1712.52] to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1712.52 → 1737.54] So we are in the book of Romans.
[1737.54 → 1742.06] Romans, we are moving to chapter two.
[1743.38 → 1744.86] So please open your Bibles.
[1745.74 → 1748.18] You have them in the pews in front of you
[1748.18 → 1750.56] to Romans chapter two.
[1752.10 → 1754.16] And that is on page 837.
[1756.28 → 1758.02] 837, Romans chapter two.
[1758.10 → 1759.74] And we'll be looking at the first five verses
[1759.74 → 1760.52] of the chapter.
[1760.52 → 1763.04] And so this letter of Romans
[1763.04 → 1764.50] was written by the Apostle Paul
[1764.50 → 1765.82] to the church in Rome.
[1766.60 → 1768.56] And the great theme of the letter
[1768.56 → 1769.66] is the gospel.
[1770.64 → 1772.08] God's plan of salvation
[1772.08 → 1775.14] for all those called to belong
[1775.14 → 1776.60] to Jesus Christ.
[1779.80 → 1781.82] And, so please give your attention
[1781.82 → 1783.32] as I read it for us.
[1783.64 → 1784.82] Romans chapter two,
[1785.06 → 1785.90] starting in verse one.
[1785.90 → 1790.16] You therefore have no excuse,
[1790.96 → 1792.94] you who pass judgment on someone else.
[1793.68 → 1796.00] For at whatever point you judge the other,
[1796.46 → 1797.78] you are condemning yourself
[1797.78 → 1799.56] because you pass judgment,
[1800.00 → 1801.30] because you who pass judgment
[1801.30 → 1802.60] do the same things.
[1803.24 → 1805.08] Now we know that God's judgment
[1805.08 → 1806.92] against those who do such things
[1806.92 → 1807.90] is based on truth.
[1808.56 → 1810.20] So when you, a mere man,
[1810.20 → 1811.76] pass judgment on them
[1811.76 → 1813.30] and yet do the same things,
[1813.72 → 1815.02] do you think you will escape
[1815.02 → 1815.76] God's judgment?
[1816.48 → 1817.76] Or do you show contempt
[1817.76 → 1819.28] for the riches of his kindness,
[1819.96 → 1821.10] tolerance, and patience,
[1821.54 → 1823.48] not realizing that God's kindness
[1823.48 → 1824.90] leads you toward repentance?
[1825.76 → 1827.48] But because of your stubbornness
[1827.48 → 1828.64] and unrepentant heart,
[1828.94 → 1830.22] you are storing up wrath
[1830.22 → 1831.10] against yourself
[1831.10 → 1832.56] for the day of God's wrath
[1832.56 → 1834.48] when his righteous judgment
[1834.48 → 1836.24] will be revealed.
[1836.96 → 1838.10] This is the word of the Lord.
[1838.66 → 1839.06] Amen.
[1839.96 → 1841.60] Let's pray and ask
[1841.60 → 1843.98] for God's blessing upon us.
[1844.30 → 1844.64] Let's pray.
[1845.02 → 1848.26] Father, we pray now
[1848.26 → 1851.18] that as we turn to your word
[1851.18 → 1852.08] that we would humble
[1852.08 → 1853.22] our hearts before you.
[1854.14 → 1855.76] We pray that by your spirit
[1855.76 → 1857.06] you would awaken us.
[1857.86 → 1858.98] Lord, would you stir us,
[1859.08 → 1860.24] would you cause us
[1860.24 → 1863.26] to be sensitive to our sin
[1863.26 → 1866.48] so that we might be
[1866.48 → 1867.60] a repentant people
[1867.60 → 1869.52] and that we might look
[1869.52 → 1871.48] to Jesus our Lord
[1871.48 → 1873.44] even now this morning?
[1874.64 → 1876.18] Lord, would you help us
[1876.18 → 1877.60] as we open your word?
[1878.24 → 1880.38] We pray for Jesus' sake
[1880.38 → 1881.14] and in his name.
[1881.48 → 1881.78] Amen.
[1881.78 → 1885.56] So we're picking up here
[1885.56 → 1886.50] in Romans chapter 2
[1886.50 → 1887.66] in the midst of
[1887.66 → 1889.32] kind of longer argument
[1889.32 → 1891.30] that Paul is making
[1891.30 → 1892.74] about the judgment of God.
[1893.18 → 1894.22] And it's an argument
[1894.22 → 1895.28] that really started back
[1895.28 → 1897.34] in chapter 1 verse 18
[1897.34 → 1898.74] and is going to continue
[1898.74 → 1900.26] into chapter 3.
[1900.26 → 1901.96] So here we are
[1901.96 → 1902.80] kind of in the middle
[1902.80 → 1905.82] and this idea though
[1905.82 → 1908.14] that God would have a law
[1908.14 → 1910.86] that he expects everybody
[1910.86 → 1912.16] to obey
[1912.16 → 1914.62] and that if they don't
[1914.62 → 1915.82] they will receive judgment.
[1916.22 → 1917.84] We find that very offensive.
[1919.00 → 1921.50] Especially in our day to day.
[1921.50 → 1923.42] And yet that is what
[1923.42 → 1924.82] the Bible clearly says.
[1925.86 → 1927.76] And our trouble with God
[1927.76 → 1930.84] as a God who judges
[1930.84 → 1933.16] it really goes right back
[1933.16 → 1933.94] to the very beginning
[1933.94 → 1934.58] of humanity.
[1935.44 → 1935.58] Right?
[1935.64 → 1938.00] The lie that Satan brought
[1938.00 → 1939.22] to Adam and Eve in the garden
[1939.22 → 1942.92] is that you really can't trust God
[1942.92 → 1944.78] to decide what is right
[1944.78 → 1945.78] and wrong for you.
[1946.68 → 1946.96] Right?
[1947.06 → 1949.08] You are in a much better
[1949.08 → 1950.44] position yourself
[1950.44 → 1953.52] to work that out.
[1954.44 → 1954.72] You know?
[1955.10 → 1956.38] To make that
[1956.38 → 1957.84] you're in a better position
[1957.84 → 1959.04] to judge.
[1959.76 → 1960.78] And that is the lie
[1960.78 → 1961.90] that Satan told.
[1962.58 → 1963.74] And as soon as
[1963.74 → 1965.66] Satan gets Adam and Eve
[1965.66 → 1966.82] thinking in that way
[1966.82 → 1969.50] the very first truth of God
[1969.50 → 1970.68] that Satan denies
[1970.68 → 1972.34] is God's judgment.
[1973.26 → 1973.38] Right?
[1973.46 → 1974.38] God had said
[1974.38 → 1975.66] if you eat this fruit
[1975.66 → 1976.40] you will die.
[1976.86 → 1977.86] And Satan comes along
[1977.86 → 1978.34] and he says
[1978.34 → 1979.70] you will not die.
[1980.44 → 1982.76] He denies God's judgment.
[1983.90 → 1985.06] And that is the same lie
[1985.06 → 1985.76] that he's been trying
[1985.76 → 1986.86] to get us to believe
[1986.86 → 1988.52] ever since.
[1989.52 → 1990.10] Right?
[1990.18 → 1991.86] We don't want a God
[1991.86 → 1993.18] who judges.
[1994.32 → 1995.08] And instead
[1995.08 → 1998.28] we've appointed ourselves
[1998.28 → 2000.24] as judge
[2000.24 → 2001.54] in God's place.
[2002.22 → 2003.52] We decide what's right
[2003.52 → 2003.98] and wrong.
[2004.72 → 2006.40] Not only for ourselves
[2006.40 → 2008.50] but then for other people
[2008.50 → 2008.94] as well.
[2010.14 → 2011.32] And the real problem
[2011.32 → 2011.98] with that though
[2011.98 → 2012.74] as Paul is going to
[2012.74 → 2013.74] try to show us here
[2013.74 → 2015.96] is that it blinds us
[2015.96 → 2017.12] from seeing our own sin.
[2017.96 → 2018.92] It blinds us from seeing
[2018.92 → 2019.96] our own need
[2019.96 → 2020.84] to repent
[2020.84 → 2022.30] and to look
[2022.30 → 2023.62] to Jesus Christ
[2023.62 → 2024.34] in humility
[2024.34 → 2025.20] and in repentance.
[2025.20 → 2025.40] repentance.
[2026.48 → 2027.34] And so our passage
[2027.34 → 2028.10] this morning
[2028.10 → 2029.42] you know
[2029.42 → 2030.32] Paul wants
[2030.32 → 2031.98] to dislodge us
[2031.98 → 2032.80] from our
[2032.80 → 2033.98] judgment seats
[2033.98 → 2034.80] that we have
[2034.80 → 2036.16] sat ourselves on
[2036.16 → 2037.62] because he knows
[2037.62 → 2038.32] it's only when
[2038.32 → 2039.56] these little thrones
[2039.56 → 2040.52] that we have set up
[2040.52 → 2041.46] for ourselves
[2041.46 → 2042.92] when they begin
[2042.92 → 2043.86] to wobble
[2043.86 → 2045.54] only then
[2045.54 → 2046.22] will we actually
[2046.22 → 2046.86] hear what God
[2046.86 → 2047.32] is saying
[2047.32 → 2048.68] and turn to him
[2048.68 → 2049.24] in repentance.
[2050.36 → 2050.92] And so
[2050.92 → 2051.70] as we look
[2051.70 → 2052.26] through this passage
[2052.26 → 2052.90] we're going to see
[2052.90 → 2055.26] how Paul does this
[2055.26 → 2055.78] how he
[2055.78 → 2057.50] kind of shakes us
[2057.50 → 2057.80] a bit
[2057.80 → 2058.78] off of the
[2058.78 → 2059.94] judgment thrones
[2059.94 → 2060.42] that we have
[2060.42 → 2061.22] put ourselves on
[2061.22 → 2061.96] and from which
[2061.96 → 2064.10] we judge other people.
[2065.26 → 2066.66] So now remember
[2066.66 → 2069.14] the Apostle Paul
[2069.14 → 2070.04] had just finished
[2070.04 → 2071.28] at the end of chapter 1
[2071.28 → 2072.50] a fairly brutal
[2072.50 → 2073.06] description
[2073.06 → 2074.90] of a culture
[2074.90 → 2075.88] of a world
[2075.88 → 2076.98] really talking
[2076.98 → 2078.02] to all people
[2078.02 → 2079.42] who have
[2079.42 → 2080.74] just been given over
[2080.74 → 2081.56] in their sin
[2081.56 → 2082.34] to greed
[2082.34 → 2084.26] to self-indulgence
[2084.26 → 2085.98] to sexual deviation
[2085.98 → 2087.60] inventing all sorts
[2087.60 → 2088.06] of evil
[2088.06 → 2089.32] children disobeying
[2089.32 → 2089.86] their parents
[2089.86 → 2090.96] all of these things.
[2092.58 → 2093.54] And in Romans 1
[2093.54 → 2094.10] one of the really
[2094.10 → 2095.02] interesting things
[2095.02 → 2095.60] is that Paul
[2095.60 → 2096.44] kept using
[2096.44 → 2098.10] the third person
[2098.10 → 2098.60] pronoun
[2098.60 → 2100.32] as he goes
[2100.32 → 2101.08] throughout this passage.
[2101.08 → 2102.04] So he kept saying
[2102.04 → 2102.58] things like
[2102.58 → 2104.12] they do this
[2104.12 → 2105.76] they do that
[2105.76 → 2106.36] right
[2106.36 → 2107.20] God gave
[2107.20 → 2108.28] them over
[2108.28 → 2110.14] but now
[2110.14 → 2111.00] if you notice
[2111.00 → 2111.42] as we look
[2111.42 → 2112.38] at chapter 2
[2112.38 → 2113.76] there's a sudden
[2113.76 → 2115.00] shift in pronouns
[2115.00 → 2116.76] he stops saying
[2116.76 → 2117.58] they they they
[2117.58 → 2119.00] and he starts
[2119.00 → 2119.46] saying
[2119.46 → 2120.50] you
[2120.50 → 2122.76] now
[2122.76 → 2123.86] we might want
[2123.86 → 2124.18] to ask
[2124.18 → 2125.12] why does
[2125.12 → 2125.84] he does this
[2125.84 → 2126.30] like what
[2126.30 → 2126.58] you know
[2126.58 → 2127.36] what's going on
[2127.36 → 2129.84] so imagine
[2129.84 → 2130.34] this
[2130.34 → 2132.08] Paul has been
[2132.08 → 2132.58] preaching
[2132.58 → 2133.64] the gospel
[2133.64 → 2134.26] in churches
[2134.26 → 2134.74] already
[2134.74 → 2135.44] for a long
[2135.44 → 2136.02] long time
[2136.02 → 2136.64] right
[2136.64 → 2137.16] he's been
[2137.16 → 2137.88] all over
[2137.88 → 2138.64] the Roman Empire
[2138.64 → 2139.26] he's seen
[2139.26 → 2139.82] all kinds
[2139.82 → 2140.28] of churches
[2140.28 → 2140.84] he's talked
[2140.84 → 2141.26] to Jews
[2141.26 → 2141.72] he's talked
[2141.72 → 2143.18] to Gentiles
[2143.18 → 2144.54] so he is
[2144.54 → 2145.50] pretty familiar
[2145.50 → 2147.24] with the arguments
[2147.24 → 2148.52] from both the Jews
[2148.52 → 2149.28] and the Gentiles
[2149.28 → 2150.04] as he's presenting
[2150.04 → 2150.56] the gospel
[2150.56 → 2152.58] he knows
[2152.58 → 2153.36] from experience
[2153.36 → 2155.40] that when he speaks
[2155.40 → 2156.50] against sin
[2156.50 → 2158.06] particularly
[2158.06 → 2159.60] against sins
[2159.60 → 2160.76] that the Jews
[2160.76 → 2162.44] perceive as
[2162.44 → 2164.06] Gentile sins
[2164.06 → 2165.76] sexual immorality
[2165.76 → 2166.68] and idolatry
[2166.68 → 2167.54] he knows
[2167.54 → 2168.10] that the Jews
[2168.10 → 2168.54] are going to
[2168.54 → 2168.88] kind of
[2168.88 → 2169.62] come up
[2169.62 → 2170.38] next to Paul
[2170.38 → 2171.02] and they're
[2171.02 → 2171.26] going to
[2171.26 → 2172.36] nod their heads
[2172.36 → 2172.94] and say
[2172.94 → 2173.82] yeah Paul
[2173.82 → 2174.68] that is right
[2174.68 → 2176.92] they do this
[2176.92 → 2178.80] they do that
[2178.80 → 2183.20] and he knows
[2183.20 → 2184.18] that they would
[2184.18 → 2185.18] also say
[2185.18 → 2187.10] but we don't
[2187.10 → 2188.74] that doesn't
[2188.74 → 2189.60] describe us
[2189.60 → 2190.66] we don't
[2190.66 → 2191.32] worship idols
[2191.32 → 2192.58] we haven't
[2192.58 → 2193.28] run from
[2193.28 → 2194.02] far from God
[2194.02 → 2194.52] we haven't gotten
[2194.52 → 2194.98] mixed up
[2194.98 → 2195.80] in sexual sin
[2195.80 → 2196.94] the Gentiles
[2196.94 → 2197.52] do that
[2197.52 → 2198.48] not use
[2198.48 → 2200.38] and so now
[2200.38 → 2201.24] in chapter 2
[2201.24 → 2201.84] it's like Paul
[2201.84 → 2203.70] turns to the Jews
[2203.70 → 2204.96] who are saying
[2204.96 → 2205.46] amen
[2205.46 → 2206.78] to what he said
[2206.78 → 2207.36] so far
[2207.36 → 2208.92] who think
[2208.92 → 2209.64] that chapter 1
[2209.64 → 2210.50] does not describe
[2210.50 → 2210.90] them
[2210.90 → 2212.70] and he says
[2212.70 → 2214.04] he says this
[2214.04 → 2214.76] verse 1
[2214.76 → 2215.52] of chapter 2
[2215.52 → 2217.06] you
[2217.06 → 2217.98] therefore
[2217.98 → 2220.12] have no excuse
[2220.12 → 2221.20] you who pass
[2221.20 → 2221.78] judgment on
[2221.78 → 2222.36] someone else
[2222.36 → 2222.88] for at
[2222.88 → 2223.98] whatever point
[2223.98 → 2224.78] you judge
[2224.78 → 2225.32] another
[2225.32 → 2226.44] you are
[2226.44 → 2227.04] condemning
[2227.04 → 2227.82] yourself
[2227.82 → 2228.40] because you
[2228.40 → 2228.78] who pass
[2228.78 → 2229.16] judgment
[2229.16 → 2230.54] do the very
[2230.54 → 2231.86] same thing
[2231.86 → 2234.34] he's talking
[2234.34 → 2234.86] to people
[2234.86 → 2235.34] who have put
[2235.34 → 2236.02] themselves
[2236.02 → 2237.66] in the judgment
[2237.66 → 2238.78] seat
[2238.78 → 2239.90] who think
[2239.90 → 2240.94] that what Paul
[2240.94 → 2241.54] is talking about
[2241.54 → 2241.94] sin
[2241.94 → 2243.14] doesn't apply
[2243.14 → 2243.76] to them
[2243.76 → 2245.66] we know
[2245.66 → 2246.12] he's
[2246.12 → 2247.04] in all
[2247.04 → 2247.30] you know
[2247.30 → 2248.20] most commentators
[2248.20 → 2249.10] nowadays say
[2249.10 → 2249.60] that here
[2249.60 → 2250.24] he is talking
[2250.24 → 2250.86] to the Jews
[2250.86 → 2251.36] and we see
[2251.36 → 2251.90] that down
[2251.90 → 2253.04] in verse 17
[2253.04 → 2253.72] we're not getting
[2253.72 → 2254.84] to that today
[2254.84 → 2255.66] but it says
[2255.66 → 2256.12] now you
[2256.12 → 2256.58] if you call
[2256.58 → 2257.38] yourself a Jew
[2257.38 → 2258.54] if you rely
[2258.54 → 2259.08] on the law
[2259.08 → 2259.52] and brag
[2259.52 → 2260.00] about your
[2260.00 → 2260.44] relationship
[2260.44 → 2261.06] to God
[2261.06 → 2261.38] okay
[2261.38 → 2261.88] so he's
[2261.88 → 2262.18] talking
[2262.18 → 2262.78] to the Jews
[2262.78 → 2263.08] here
[2263.08 → 2265.00] why doesn't
[2265.00 → 2265.68] he first
[2265.68 → 2266.44] just say
[2266.44 → 2267.20] and then
[2267.20 → 2268.00] you Jews
[2268.00 → 2269.34] why doesn't
[2269.34 → 2269.58] he just
[2269.58 → 2269.90] come right
[2269.90 → 2270.28] out and
[2270.28 → 2270.74] say it
[2270.74 → 2271.66] well the
[2271.66 → 2272.42] reason is
[2272.42 → 2272.80] he's trying
[2272.80 → 2273.14] to set
[2273.14 → 2273.60] them up
[2273.60 → 2275.68] you know
[2275.68 → 2276.40] how when
[2276.40 → 2276.84] the prophet
[2276.84 → 2277.16] Nathan
[2277.16 → 2277.66] came to
[2277.66 → 2277.98] David
[2277.98 → 2279.24] in his
[2279.24 → 2279.40] sin
[2279.40 → 2279.62] what did
[2279.62 → 2280.00] he does
[2280.00 → 2280.62] he didn't
[2280.62 → 2280.90] say
[2280.90 → 2281.42] David
[2281.42 → 2281.80] you are
[2281.80 → 2282.48] an adulterer
[2282.48 → 2283.22] he said
[2283.22 → 2284.50] there's this
[2284.50 → 2284.76] you know
[2284.76 → 2285.08] he tells
[2285.08 → 2285.78] this story
[2285.78 → 2287.60] to set
[2287.60 → 2288.22] David up
[2288.22 → 2288.78] for him
[2288.78 → 2289.20] to then
[2289.20 → 2289.52] say
[2289.52 → 2290.50] that person
[2290.50 → 2291.04] you know
[2291.04 → 2291.54] is
[2291.54 → 2292.98] condemned
[2292.98 → 2293.80] then
[2293.80 → 2294.40] Paul
[2294.40 → 2295.14] Nathan
[2295.14 → 2295.62] says
[2295.62 → 2296.60] you are
[2296.60 → 2297.16] the man
[2297.16 → 2298.16] okay
[2298.16 → 2298.90] Paul is
[2298.90 → 2299.22] doing a
[2299.22 → 2299.80] similar thing
[2299.80 → 2300.30] here
[2300.30 → 2300.74] in this
[2300.74 → 2301.30] diatribe
[2301.30 → 2301.80] he is
[2301.80 → 2302.38] he's
[2302.38 → 2302.58] saying
[2302.58 → 2303.28] the Jews
[2303.28 → 2303.52] up
[2303.52 → 2303.88] and saying
[2303.88 → 2304.06] you know
[2304.06 → 2304.34] there are
[2304.34 → 2304.78] these people
[2304.78 → 2305.02] who are
[2305.02 → 2305.30] really
[2305.30 → 2306.06] judgmental
[2306.06 → 2306.96] and it
[2306.96 → 2307.28] comes to
[2307.28 → 2307.82] find out
[2307.82 → 2308.32] you know
[2308.32 → 2308.94] this is a
[2308.94 → 2309.38] problem
[2309.38 → 2310.20] of the
[2310.20 → 2310.52] Jews
[2310.52 → 2311.82] so
[2311.82 → 2313.26] now
[2313.26 → 2314.68] this whole
[2314.68 → 2315.50] idea though
[2315.50 → 2316.18] of
[2316.18 → 2317.64] not
[2317.64 → 2318.22] judging
[2318.22 → 2318.98] others
[2318.98 → 2320.68] this tracks
[2320.68 → 2321.40] very closely
[2321.40 → 2322.48] with what
[2322.48 → 2323.08] Jesus said
[2323.08 → 2323.32] in the
[2323.32 → 2323.74] Sermon on the
[2323.74 → 2323.86] Mount
[2323.86 → 2324.36] doesn't it
[2324.36 → 2325.26] okay
[2325.26 → 2325.84] so in
[2325.84 → 2326.26] Matthew
[2326.26 → 2326.98] chapter 7
[2326.98 → 2327.54] verse 1
[2327.54 → 2329.04] Jesus very
[2329.04 → 2329.48] famously
[2329.48 → 2330.28] says this
[2330.28 → 2331.48] do not
[2331.48 → 2332.00] judge
[2332.00 → 2332.58] or you
[2332.58 → 2332.96] too
[2332.96 → 2333.54] will be
[2333.54 → 2334.00] judged
[2334.00 → 2336.74] you know
[2336.74 → 2337.16] and people
[2337.16 → 2337.50] in our
[2337.50 → 2337.80] culture
[2337.80 → 2338.22] say
[2338.22 → 2338.90] that's
[2338.90 → 2339.16] right
[2339.16 → 2339.78] the Bible
[2339.78 → 2340.20] says
[2340.20 → 2340.66] do not
[2340.66 → 2341.08] judge
[2341.08 → 2343.86] now
[2343.86 → 2344.98] the thing
[2344.98 → 2345.40] is
[2345.40 → 2346.32] this is
[2346.32 → 2347.16] one of the
[2347.16 → 2347.62] most often
[2347.62 → 2348.06] quoted
[2348.06 → 2348.86] sayings
[2348.86 → 2349.26] of Jesus
[2349.26 → 2350.36] but
[2350.36 → 2350.78] really
[2350.78 → 2351.20] the least
[2351.20 → 2351.68] understood
[2351.68 → 2354.02] the Greek
[2354.02 → 2354.52] verb
[2354.52 → 2355.10] that Jesus
[2355.10 → 2355.72] uses
[2355.72 → 2356.50] for judge
[2356.50 → 2356.94] means
[2356.94 → 2357.20] to
[2357.20 → 2357.86] sentence
[2357.86 → 2358.58] it means
[2358.58 → 2359.10] to declare
[2359.10 → 2359.88] a verdict
[2359.88 → 2360.32] to
[2360.32 → 2361.00] condemn
[2361.00 → 2363.22] and so
[2363.22 → 2363.76] when Jesus
[2363.76 → 2364.08] says
[2364.08 → 2364.74] do not
[2364.74 → 2365.70] judge
[2365.70 → 2366.56] he doesn't
[2366.56 → 2367.02] mean
[2367.02 → 2367.44] do not
[2367.44 → 2367.96] pass
[2367.96 → 2369.00] and do
[2369.00 → 2369.40] not make
[2369.40 → 2370.04] a value
[2370.04 → 2370.44] judgment
[2370.44 → 2371.50] he does
[2371.50 → 2372.14] not mean
[2372.14 → 2373.08] you should
[2373.08 → 2373.80] not discern
[2373.80 → 2374.14] between
[2374.14 → 2374.60] right and
[2374.60 → 2375.00] wrong
[2375.00 → 2375.44] right
[2375.44 → 2375.66] that's
[2375.66 → 2376.24] not what
[2376.24 → 2376.56] Jesus
[2376.56 → 2377.36] is saying
[2377.36 → 2378.70] you know
[2378.70 → 2379.12] because
[2379.12 → 2379.86] just a couple
[2379.86 → 2380.58] verses later
[2380.58 → 2381.88] he says
[2381.88 → 2382.54] do not
[2382.54 → 2383.06] throw your
[2383.06 → 2383.44] pearls
[2383.44 → 2384.02] to pigs
[2384.02 → 2386.02] and so
[2386.02 → 2386.42] do you
[2386.42 → 2386.84] not need
[2386.84 → 2387.16] to make
[2387.16 → 2387.60] a judgment
[2387.60 → 2388.30] who the
[2388.30 → 2388.84] pigs are
[2388.84 → 2389.64] so that
[2389.64 → 2389.94] you don't
[2389.94 → 2390.16] throw
[2390.16 → 2390.48] pearls
[2390.48 → 2390.90] to them
[2390.90 → 2391.56] right
[2391.56 → 2392.12] so context
[2392.12 → 2392.70] is important
[2392.70 → 2394.34] and really
[2394.34 → 2394.90] we cannot
[2394.90 → 2395.40] function
[2395.40 → 2396.12] in a world
[2396.12 → 2396.52] especially
[2396.52 → 2397.08] a broken
[2397.08 → 2397.54] world
[2397.54 → 2398.48] unless we
[2398.48 → 2399.00] make judgments
[2399.00 → 2400.10] we all
[2400.10 → 2400.68] make judgments
[2400.68 → 2401.04] all the
[2401.04 → 2401.36] time
[2401.36 → 2401.98] parents
[2401.98 → 2403.26] must constantly
[2403.26 → 2404.30] make judgments
[2404.30 → 2405.04] as they
[2405.04 → 2405.44] raise their
[2405.44 → 2405.82] kids
[2405.82 → 2407.40] business
[2407.40 → 2408.06] and political
[2408.06 → 2408.58] leaders
[2408.58 → 2409.68] must constantly
[2409.68 → 2410.64] make good
[2410.64 → 2411.54] judgments
[2411.54 → 2412.60] or else
[2412.60 → 2413.06] society
[2413.06 → 2413.74] will collapse
[2413.74 → 2415.26] how can
[2415.26 → 2415.64] we
[2415.64 → 2416.96] who are
[2416.96 → 2417.20] going to
[2417.20 → 2417.44] vote
[2417.44 → 2417.96] in our
[2417.96 → 2418.50] elections
[2418.50 → 2420.26] we
[2420.26 → 2420.72] we must
[2420.72 → 2421.10] make a
[2421.10 → 2421.42] judgment
[2421.42 → 2421.88] that is
[2421.88 → 2422.20] the act
[2422.20 → 2422.60] of voting
[2422.60 → 2423.10] to judge
[2423.10 → 2423.40] between
[2423.40 → 2424.02] candidates
[2424.02 → 2424.52] and
[2424.52 → 2425.00] platforms
[2425.00 → 2426.90] so when
[2426.90 → 2427.42] Jesus says
[2427.42 → 2427.72] do not
[2427.72 → 2428.24] judge
[2428.24 → 2429.32] he's not
[2429.32 → 2429.92] saying do
[2429.92 → 2430.20] not make
[2430.20 → 2430.96] a value
[2430.96 → 2431.38] judgment
[2431.38 → 2431.84] do not
[2431.84 → 2432.16] kind of
[2432.16 → 2432.64] discern right
[2432.64 → 2433.04] and wrong
[2433.04 → 2433.50] he's saying
[2433.50 → 2433.90] do not
[2433.90 → 2434.54] condemn
[2434.54 → 2435.62] he's saying
[2435.62 → 2436.32] do not
[2436.32 → 2436.88] pass
[2436.88 → 2437.82] the final
[2437.82 → 2438.90] sentence
[2438.90 → 2440.04] do not
[2440.04 → 2440.42] render
[2440.42 → 2441.10] the final
[2441.10 → 2441.54] verdict
[2441.54 → 2442.08] on someone
[2442.08 → 2442.62] else
[2442.62 → 2443.24] because that
[2443.24 → 2443.86] is God's
[2443.86 → 2444.38] job
[2444.38 → 2445.48] not yours
[2445.48 → 2447.36] okay so
[2447.36 → 2447.52] now
[2447.52 → 2448.84] coming back
[2448.84 → 2449.38] to Romans
[2449.38 → 2450.60] what Paul
[2450.60 → 2451.14] is saying
[2451.14 → 2451.76] is not
[2451.76 → 2452.14] that we
[2452.14 → 2452.56] should not
[2452.56 → 2452.92] judge
[2452.92 → 2453.28] right from
[2453.28 → 2453.52] wrong
[2453.52 → 2453.84] good from
[2453.84 → 2454.08] evil
[2454.08 → 2454.52] of course
[2454.52 → 2454.94] we should
[2454.94 → 2456.22] what he
[2456.22 → 2456.86] is saying
[2456.86 → 2457.92] is that
[2457.92 → 2458.36] there is
[2458.36 → 2459.20] a danger
[2459.20 → 2460.98] in judging
[2460.98 → 2462.98] it's okay
[2462.98 → 2463.60] to judge
[2463.60 → 2464.02] people
[2464.02 → 2464.68] if it's
[2464.68 → 2465.14] according
[2465.14 → 2466.06] judging
[2466.06 → 2466.50] them according
[2466.50 → 2466.96] to God's
[2466.96 → 2467.34] law
[2467.34 → 2469.10] however
[2469.10 → 2469.52] what is
[2469.52 → 2470.36] not okay
[2470.36 → 2471.38] is to
[2471.38 → 2471.62] say
[2471.62 → 2472.06] God
[2472.06 → 2472.80] will judge
[2472.80 → 2473.28] those
[2473.28 → 2473.72] people
[2473.72 → 2474.68] and I
[2474.68 → 2475.26] am not
[2475.26 → 2475.72] like
[2475.72 → 2476.28] those
[2476.28 → 2476.74] people
[2476.74 → 2478.80] it's to
[2478.80 → 2479.02] say
[2479.02 → 2479.58] I thank
[2479.58 → 2479.82] thee
[2479.82 → 2480.10] Lord
[2480.10 → 2480.56] that I
[2480.56 → 2480.92] am not
[2480.92 → 2481.16] like
[2481.16 → 2481.38] other
[2481.38 → 2481.64] men
[2481.64 → 2483.74] and that
[2483.74 → 2484.02] is what
[2484.02 → 2484.28] they were
[2484.28 → 2484.62] doing
[2484.62 → 2485.30] okay
[2485.30 → 2485.54] that's
[2485.54 → 2485.64] what
[2485.64 → 2485.84] they were
[2485.84 → 2486.06] doing
[2486.06 → 2486.60] so look
[2486.60 → 2486.92] again
[2486.92 → 2487.16] let's
[2487.16 → 2487.46] put up
[2487.46 → 2487.74] again
[2487.74 → 2488.16] verse
[2488.16 → 2488.50] one
[2488.50 → 2489.40] you
[2489.40 → 2489.80] therefore
[2489.80 → 2490.18] have
[2490.18 → 2490.36] no
[2490.36 → 2490.82] excuse
[2490.82 → 2491.08] you
[2491.08 → 2491.28] who
[2491.28 → 2491.58] pass
[2491.58 → 2491.92] judgment
[2491.92 → 2492.18] on
[2492.18 → 2492.42] someone
[2492.42 → 2492.88] else
[2492.88 → 2493.62] for
[2493.62 → 2493.72] at
[2493.72 → 2493.98] whatever
[2493.98 → 2494.30] point
[2494.30 → 2494.52] you
[2494.52 → 2494.84] judge
[2494.84 → 2495.12] another
[2495.12 → 2495.42] you're
[2495.42 → 2495.86] condemning
[2495.86 → 2496.30] yourself
[2496.30 → 2496.86] why
[2496.86 → 2498.30] because

[2499.44 → 2499.76] do
[2499.76 → 2500.04] the
[2500.04 → 2500.48] same
[2500.48 → 2501.44] thing
[2501.44 → 2502.88] you're
[2502.88 → 2503.22] saying
[2503.22 → 2503.68] God
[2503.68 → 2503.84] will
[2503.84 → 2504.08] judge
[2504.08 → 2504.28] you
[2504.28 → 2504.50] but
[2504.50 → 2504.84] I
[2504.84 → 2505.90] excuse
[2505.90 → 2507.16] myself
[2507.16 → 2508.08] from
[2508.08 → 2508.36] that
[2508.36 → 2508.72] judgment
[2508.72 → 2510.50] which
[2510.50 → 2510.92] is
[2510.92 → 2511.30] literally
[2511.30 → 2511.56] the
[2511.56 → 2512.02] definition
[2512.02 → 2512.44] of a
[2512.44 → 2512.88] hypocrite
[2512.88 → 2514.20] right
[2514.20 → 2514.90] the
[2514.90 → 2515.16] very
[2515.16 → 2515.66] same
[2515.66 → 2515.98] things
[2515.98 → 2516.26] that we
[2516.26 → 2516.48] judge
[2516.48 → 2516.84] others
[2516.84 → 2517.30] to do
[2517.30 → 2518.08] we
[2518.08 → 2518.46] do
[2518.46 → 2518.72] the
[2518.72 → 2519.10] same
[2519.10 → 2519.90] thing
[2519.90 → 2521.04] now
[2521.04 → 2521.46] an
[2521.46 → 2521.86] example
[2521.86 → 2522.18] of
[2522.18 → 2522.48] this
[2522.48 → 2522.86] that

[2535.56 → 2536.10] fairly
[2536.10 → 2536.44] boring
[2536.44 → 2536.82] compared
[2536.82 → 2537.00] to
[2537.00 → 2537.28] today

[2616.50 → 2616.64] long
[2616.64 → 2617.12] time
[2617.12 → 2618.24] you
[2618.24 → 2618.40] should
[2618.40 → 2618.58] take
[2618.58 → 2618.72] a
[2618.72 → 2619.02] break
[2619.02 → 2619.34] now
[2619.34 → 2619.56] from
[2619.56 → 2619.82] social
[2619.82 → 2620.08] media
[2620.08 → 2620.26] from
[2620.26 → 2620.40] your
[2620.40 → 2620.84] screens
[2620.84 → 2622.14] but
[2622.14 → 2622.30] there
[2622.30 → 2622.44] has
[2622.44 → 2622.60] been
[2622.60 → 2622.80] more
[2622.80 → 2622.94] than
[2622.94 → 2623.06] one
[2623.06 → 2623.44] occasion
[2623.44 → 2624.26] when
[2624.26 → 2624.60] I
[2624.60 → 2624.88] have
[2624.88 → 2625.12] found
[2625.12 → 2625.60] myself
[2625.60 → 2626.14] immediately
[2626.14 → 2626.54] turning
[2626.54 → 2626.90] around
[2626.90 → 2627.32] and
[2627.32 → 2627.60] pulling
[2627.60 → 2627.74] out
[2627.74 → 2627.90] my
[2627.90 → 2628.12] phone
[2628.12 → 2630.98] so
[2630.98 → 2631.14] the
[2631.14 → 2631.62] problem
[2631.62 → 2632.02] is
[2632.02 → 2632.64] not
[2632.64 → 2633.06] that
[2633.06 → 2633.26] I'm
[2633.26 → 2633.54] telling
[2633.54 → 2633.78] my
[2633.78 → 2634.02] kids
[2634.02 → 2634.16] what
[2634.16 → 2634.28] they
[2634.28 → 2634.48] should
[2634.48 → 2634.58] and
[2634.58 → 2634.70] should
[2634.70 → 2634.86] not
[2634.86 → 2635.30] do
[2635.30 → 2636.28] the
[2636.28 → 2636.64] problem
[2636.64 → 2636.92] is
[2636.92 → 2637.18] I'm
[2637.18 → 2637.36] doing
[2637.36 → 2637.54] the
[2637.54 → 2637.70] same
[2637.70 → 2637.98] thing
[2637.98 → 2639.56] I'm
[2639.56 → 2639.94] judging
[2639.94 → 2640.34] them
[2640.34 → 2640.50] but
[2640.50 → 2640.64] I'm
[2640.64 → 2640.94] not
[2640.94 → 2641.64] judging
[2641.64 → 2642.42] myself
[2642.42 → 2644.12] and
[2644.12 → 2644.24] I'm
[2644.24 → 2644.42] sure
[2644.42 → 2644.52] you
[2644.52 → 2644.64] can
[2644.64 → 2644.80] come
[2644.80 → 2644.94] up
[2644.94 → 2645.06] with
[2645.06 → 2645.18] your
[2645.18 → 2645.34] own
[2645.34 → 2645.82] examples
[2645.82 → 2648.68] but
[2648.68 → 2648.92] here's
[2648.92 → 2649.04] the
[2649.04 → 2649.42] question
[2649.42 → 2649.80] is
[2649.80 → 2650.04] what
[2650.04 → 2650.30] Paul
[2650.30 → 2650.48] is
[2650.48 → 2650.82] saying
[2650.82 → 2651.34] true
[2651.34 → 2653.28] I
[2653.28 → 2653.52] mean
[2653.52 → 2654.50] how
[2654.50 → 2655.00] can
[2655.00 → 2655.32] Paul
[2655.32 → 2655.64] say
[2655.64 → 2655.84] a
[2655.84 → 2656.14] person
[2656.14 → 2656.26] who
[2656.26 → 2656.36] is
[2656.36 → 2656.62] passing
[2656.62 → 2656.96] judgment
[2656.96 → 2657.12] on
[2657.12 → 2657.30] someone
[2657.30 → 2657.50] else
[2657.50 → 2657.98] who
[2657.98 → 2658.14] is
[2658.14 → 2658.60] sinning
[2658.60 → 2659.36] that
[2659.36 → 2659.58] they
[2659.58 → 2659.84] are
[2659.84 → 2660.40] practicing
[2660.40 → 2660.74] the
[2660.74 → 2661.06] very
[2661.06 → 2661.60] same
[2661.60 → 2662.22] thing
[2662.22 → 2663.70] that
[2663.70 → 2663.90] doesn't
[2663.90 → 2664.08] really
[2664.08 → 2664.28] seem
[2664.28 → 2664.40] to
[2664.40 → 2664.56] make
[2664.56 → 2664.80] much
[2664.80 → 2665.20] sense
[2665.20 → 2667.52] now
[2667.52 → 2667.76] I
[2667.76 → 2668.16] don't
[2668.16 → 2668.44] think
[2668.44 → 2668.72] Paul
[2668.72 → 2668.92] is
[2668.92 → 2669.36] arguing
[2669.36 → 2669.74] that
[2669.74 → 2670.48] everyone
[2670.48 → 2671.18] who
[2671.18 → 2671.50] for
[2671.50 → 2671.90] example
[2671.90 → 2672.48] says
[2672.48 → 2673.26] adultery
[2673.26 → 2673.48] is
[2673.48 → 2673.84] sin
[2673.84 → 2674.68] is
[2674.68 → 2674.88] at
[2674.88 → 2675.02] the
[2675.02 → 2675.18] same
[2675.18 → 2675.42] time
[2675.42 → 2675.80] secretly
[2675.80 → 2676.26] practicing
[2676.26 → 2676.74] adultery
[2676.74 → 2677.46] I
[2677.46 → 2677.62] mean
[2677.62 → 2677.98] certainly
[2677.98 → 2678.22] it
[2678.22 → 2678.40] does
[2678.40 → 2678.78] happen
[2678.78 → 2679.64] but
[2679.64 → 2679.76] it's
[2679.76 → 2679.86] not
[2679.86 → 2680.02] like
[2680.02 → 2680.54] everybody
[2680.54 → 2680.90] is
[2680.90 → 2681.12] doing
[2681.12 → 2681.44] that
[2681.44 → 2682.80] so
[2682.80 → 2682.94] what
[2682.94 → 2683.06] I
[2683.06 → 2683.28] think
[2683.28 → 2683.56] Paul
[2683.56 → 2683.74] is
[2683.74 → 2684.18] arguing
[2684.18 → 2684.42] is
[2684.42 → 2684.58] that
[2684.58 → 2685.12] everyone
[2685.12 → 2686.46] has
[2686.46 → 2686.68] the
[2686.68 → 2687.24] same
[2687.24 → 2688.28] heart
[2688.28 → 2688.82] problem
[2688.82 → 2690.34] everyone
[2690.34 → 2690.68] has
[2690.68 → 2690.82] the
[2690.82 → 2690.98] same
[2690.98 → 2691.18] heart
[2691.18 → 2691.58] problem
[2691.58 → 2692.08] you
[2692.08 → 2692.16] know
[2692.16 → 2692.30] we
[2692.30 → 2692.50] all
[2692.50 → 2692.70] sin
[2692.70 → 2692.84] in
[2692.84 → 2693.10] different
[2693.10 → 2693.54] ways
[2693.54 → 2693.94] we
[2693.94 → 2694.12] all
[2694.12 → 2694.28] sin
[2694.28 → 2694.40] to
[2694.40 → 2694.68] different
[2694.68 → 2695.20] degrees
[2695.20 → 2695.54] we
[2695.54 → 2695.74] all
[2695.74 → 2695.94] have
[2695.94 → 2696.20] different
[2696.20 → 2696.62] kinds
[2696.62 → 2696.76] of
[2696.76 → 2697.06] sin
[2697.06 → 2697.76] but
[2697.76 → 2697.92] the
[2697.92 → 2698.22] thing
[2698.22 → 2698.68] is
[2698.68 → 2698.88] there
[2698.88 → 2699.06] is
[2699.06 → 2699.20] a
[2699.20 → 2699.72] family
[2699.72 → 2701.02] resemblance
[2701.02 → 2702.02] to
[2702.02 → 2702.40] sin
[2702.40 → 2703.32] that
[2703.32 → 2703.58] leaves
[2703.58 → 2703.88] all
[2703.88 → 2704.04] of
[2705.80 → 2706.42] without
[2706.42 → 2706.62] a
[2706.62 → 2706.84] basis
[2706.84 → 2707.08] to
[2707.08 → 2707.30] judge
[2707.30 → 2707.66] others
[2707.66 → 2708.14] you
[2708.14 → 2708.26] know
[2708.26 → 2708.48] okay
[2708.48 → 2708.62] so
[2708.62 → 2708.76] I
[2708.76 → 2708.96] have
[2708.96 → 2709.10] a
[2709.10 → 2709.32] younger
[2709.32 → 2709.74] brother
[2709.74 → 2710.34] named
[2710.34 → 2710.74] Justin
[2710.74 → 2711.26] my
[2711.26 → 2711.46] brother
[2711.46 → 2711.80] Justin
[2711.80 → 2711.98] is
[2711.98 → 2712.36] 14
[2712.36 → 2712.68] years
[2712.68 → 2712.94] younger
[2712.94 → 2713.16] than
[2713.16 → 2713.36] me
[2713.36 → 2714.52] and
[2714.52 → 2714.86] growing
[2714.86 → 2715.16] up
[2715.16 → 2715.30] and
[2715.30 → 2715.48] still
[2715.48 → 2715.68] to
[2715.68 → 2715.90] this
[2715.90 → 2716.16] day
[2716.16 → 2716.36] my
[2716.36 → 2716.70] parents
[2716.70 → 2716.86] will
[2716.86 → 2717.32] sometimes
[2717.32 → 2717.66] call
[2717.66 → 2717.92] me
[2717.92 → 2718.34] Justin
[2718.34 → 2719.68] and
[2719.68 → 2719.90] call
[2719.90 → 2720.14] him
[2720.14 → 2720.52] Jason
[2720.52 → 2722.26] and
[2722.26 → 2722.46] to
[2722.46 → 2722.64] show
[2722.64 → 2722.74] I'm
[2722.74 → 2722.86] not
[2722.86 → 2722.96] a
[2722.96 → 2723.36] hypocrite
[2723.36 → 2723.54] I
[2723.54 → 2723.68] will
[2723.68 → 2724.04] confess
[2724.04 → 2724.24] right
[2724.24 → 2724.42] now
[2724.42 → 2724.56] I
[2724.56 → 2724.68] do
[2724.68 → 2724.82] the
[2724.82 → 2725.02] exact
[2725.02 → 2725.20] same
[2725.20 → 2725.36] thing
[2725.36 → 2725.46] with
[2725.46 → 2725.62] my
[2725.62 → 2725.86] kids
[2725.86 → 2726.82] sometimes
[2726.82 → 2727.60] I
[2727.60 → 2727.72] got
[2727.72 → 2727.94] one
[2727.94 → 2728.18] kid
[2728.18 → 2728.40] and I
[2728.40 → 2728.54] have
[2735.80 → 2735.94] brother
[2735.94 → 2736.36] Justin
[2736.36 → 2736.76] and
[2736.76 → 2737.20] I
[2737.20 → 2738.00] have
[2738.00 → 2738.24] a
[2738.24 → 2738.64] family
[2738.64 → 2739.40] resemblance
[2739.40 → 2739.92] even
[2739.92 → 2740.14] though
[2740.14 → 2740.40] I'm
[2740.40 → 2740.70] 14
[2740.70 → 2740.92] years
[2740.92 → 2741.18] older
[2741.18 → 2742.12] and
[2742.12 → 2742.28] so
[2742.28 → 2742.48] a
[2742.48 → 2742.70] while
[2742.70 → 2743.12] back
[2743.12 → 2743.24] and
[2743.24 → 2743.50] I
[2743.50 → 2743.64] don't
[2743.64 → 2743.72] know
[2743.72 → 2743.82] if
[2743.82 → 2743.90] I
[2743.90 → 2744.06] shared
[2744.06 → 2744.22] this
[2744.22 → 2744.44] already
[2744.44 → 2744.68] but
[2744.68 → 2745.00] at
[2745.00 → 2745.18] one
[2745.18 → 2745.48] point
[2745.48 → 2745.88] I
[2745.88 → 2746.32] shaved
[2746.32 → 2746.56] my
[2746.56 → 2746.94] beard
[2746.94 → 2748.40] and
[2748.40 → 2748.54] when
[2748.54 → 2748.74] my
[2748.74 → 2749.06] kids
[2749.06 → 2749.38] saw
[2749.38 → 2749.64] that
[2749.64 → 2749.82] the
[2749.82 → 2750.08] first
[2750.08 → 2750.22] thing
[2750.22 → 2750.34] they
[2750.34 → 2750.58] said
[2750.58 → 2750.82] is
[2750.82 → 2751.22] you
[2751.22 → 2751.48] look
[2751.48 → 2751.88] just
[2751.88 → 2752.20] like
[2752.20 → 2752.50] uncle
[2752.50 → 2752.90] Justin
[2752.90 → 2754.00] and
[2754.00 → 2754.16] so
[2754.16 → 2754.32] if
[2754.32 → 2754.42] I
[2754.42 → 2754.62] want
[2754.62 → 2754.80] to
[2754.80 → 2755.30] lose
[2755.30 → 2755.62] 14
[2755.62 → 2755.94] years
[2755.94 → 2756.18] I
[2756.18 → 2756.38] can
[2756.38 → 2757.18] shave
[2757.18 → 2757.34] my
[2757.34 → 2757.58] beard
[2757.58 → 2757.70] and
[2757.70 → 2757.78] I
[2757.78 → 2757.92] look
[2757.92 → 2758.10] so
[2758.10 → 2758.32] young
[2765.80 → 2767.70] there's
[2767.70 → 2767.98] actually
[2767.98 → 2768.32] something
[2768.32 → 2768.60] in
[2768.60 → 2769.02] common
[2769.02 → 2769.82] between
[2769.82 → 2770.68] someone
[2770.68 → 2770.88] who
[2770.88 → 2771.04] would
[2771.04 → 2771.36] bomb
[2771.36 → 2771.56] a
[2771.56 → 2772.04] building
[2772.04 → 2773.28] and
[2773.28 → 2773.42] a
[2773.42 → 2773.70] bully
[2773.70 → 2775.78] it's
[2775.78 → 2775.90] not
[2775.90 → 2776.06] the
[2776.06 → 2776.26] same
[2776.26 → 2776.62] sin

[2876.94 → 2877.16] what
[2877.16 → 2877.40] we
[2877.40 → 2878.08] find
[2878.08 → 2878.44] is
[2878.44 → 2878.64] that
[2878.64 → 2879.06] only
[2879.06 → 2879.64] really
[2879.64 → 2880.42] God
[2880.42 → 2881.22] can

[2970.66 → 2971.58] righteous
[2971.58 → 2974.74] and
[2974.74 → 2975.04] when we
[2975.04 → 2975.24] think

[2982.38 → 2984.48] right
[2984.48 → 2984.64] does
[2984.64 → 2984.80] that

[2986.60 → 2986.94] degree
[2986.94 → 2987.14] of
[2987.14 → 2987.60] humility
[2987.60 → 2987.92] in
[2987.92 → 2988.06] the

[2988.34 → 2988.56] of
[2988.56 → 2988.88] judgments
[2988.88 → 2989.12] that
[2989.12 → 2989.26] we
[2989.26 → 2989.52] make
[2989.52 → 2989.78] because

[2995.08 → 2996.76] right
[2996.76 → 2996.96] now
[2996.96 → 2997.14] this
[2997.14 → 2997.24] is
[2997.24 → 2997.40] very
[2997.40 → 2997.82] important
[2997.82 → 2999.48] because
[2999.48 → 2999.88] when
[2999.88 → 3000.16] we

[3006.12 → 3006.72] and
[3006.72 → 3007.16] why
[3007.16 → 3008.12] based
[3008.12 → 3008.26] on
[3008.26 → 3008.54] our

[3016.22 → 3016.84] ourselves
[3016.84 → 3017.58] in
[3017.58 → 3017.74] the
[3017.74 → 3018.04] judgment
[3018.04 → 3018.46] seat
[3018.46 → 3019.68] where

[3030.62 → 3031.24] motives
[3031.24 → 3031.56] right
[3031.56 → 3031.74] we

[3039.54 → 3039.72] they're
[3039.72 → 3040.04] always
[3040.04 → 3040.54] they're
[3040.54 → 3040.74] based
[3040.74 → 3040.90] on

[3049.70 → 3049.92] we
[3049.92 → 3050.28] live
[3050.28 → 3050.88] we
[3050.88 → 3051.28] always
[3051.28 → 3051.54] have
[3051.54 → 3051.98] biases

[3055.14 → 3055.38] of

[3055.72 → 3056.18] but
[3056.18 → 3056.52] God
[3056.52 → 3057.02] doesn't
[3057.02 → 3057.96] he
[3057.96 → 3058.14] is
[3058.14 → 3058.54] eternal
[3058.54 → 3059.08] he
[3059.08 → 3059.26] is
[3059.26 → 3059.96] unchangeable
[3059.96 → 3060.36] he
[3060.36 → 3060.72] knows

[3061.92 → 3062.12] he
[3062.12 → 3062.26] is

[3062.54 → 3063.00] he
[3063.00 → 3063.16] is

[3063.56 → 3065.08] and
[3065.08 → 3065.30] friends
[3065.30 → 3065.50] that
[3065.50 → 3065.68] is
[3065.68 → 3065.98] good
[3065.98 → 3066.44] news
[3066.44 → 3067.80] because
[3067.80 → 3068.02] we
[3068.02 → 3068.18] don't
[3068.18 → 3068.42] have
[3068.42 → 3068.56] to
[3068.56 → 3068.82] ever
[3068.82 → 3069.46] worry
[3069.46 → 3070.48] that
[3070.48 → 3070.72] he
[3070.72 → 3070.96] will
[3070.96 → 3071.30] ever
[3071.30 → 3071.76] judge
[3071.76 → 3072.24] anyone
[3072.24 → 3073.22] unfairly
[3073.22 → 3074.02] he
[3074.02 → 3074.18] will
[3074.18 → 3074.58] never
[3074.58 → 3074.90] judge
[3074.90 → 3075.24] anyone
[3075.24 → 3075.92] unfairly
[3075.92 → 3079.60] now
[3079.60 → 3079.84] if
[3079.84 → 3080.14] only
[3080.14 → 3080.64] God
[3080.64 → 3081.14] can
[3081.14 → 3081.62] judge
[3081.62 → 3081.98] then
[3081.98 → 3082.52] what
[3082.52 → 3082.66] we
[3082.66 → 3082.82] can
[3082.82 → 3083.10] say
[3083.10 → 3083.26] in
[3083.26 → 3083.46] verse
[3083.46 → 3083.86] three
[3083.86 → 3084.78] is that
[3084.78 → 3085.04] only
[3085.04 → 3085.32] God
[3085.32 → 3085.60] will
[3085.60 → 3086.04] judge
[3086.04 → 3087.66] so
[3087.66 → 3087.80] let's
[3087.80 → 3088.04] look at
[3088.04 → 3088.18] verse
[3088.18 → 3088.48] three
[3088.48 → 3089.98] so
[3089.98 → 3090.32] when
[3090.32 → 3090.70] you
[3090.70 → 3091.02] a
[3091.02 → 3091.34] mere
[3091.34 → 3091.70] human
[3091.70 → 3092.14] being
[3092.14 → 3092.84] pass
[3092.84 → 3093.22] judgment
[3093.22 → 3093.56] on
[3093.56 → 3093.82] them
[3093.82 → 3093.98] and
[3093.98 → 3094.14] yet
[3094.14 → 3094.32] do
[3094.32 → 3094.52] the
[3094.52 → 3094.70] same
[3094.70 → 3095.18] things
[3095.18 → 3095.78] do
[3095.78 → 3096.04] you
[3096.04 → 3096.34] think
[3096.34 → 3096.58] you
[3096.58 → 3096.82] will
[3096.82 → 3097.30] escape
[3097.30 → 3097.70] God's
[3097.70 → 3098.02] judgment
[3098.02 → 3101.28] what
[3101.28 → 3101.50] Paul
[3101.50 → 3101.66] is
[3101.66 → 3101.90] saying
[3101.90 → 3102.08] is
[3102.08 → 3102.30] there
[3102.30 → 3102.82] will
[3102.82 → 3103.26] be
[3103.26 → 3103.78] a
[3103.78 → 3104.06] judgment
[3104.06 → 3105.76] and
[3105.76 → 3105.96] there
[3105.96 → 3106.26] will
[3106.26 → 3106.44] be
[3106.44 → 3106.60] a
[3106.60 → 3106.86] judgment
[3106.86 → 3107.42] because
[3107.42 → 3108.02] God
[3108.02 → 3109.50] is
[3109.50 → 3109.94] holy
[3109.94 → 3110.90] and
[3110.90 → 3111.36] just
[3111.36 → 3112.78] and
[3112.78 → 3112.94] he
[3112.94 → 3113.28] must
[3113.28 → 3113.72] judge
[3113.72 → 3114.12] sin
[3114.12 → 3116.46] if
[3116.46 → 3116.58] he
[3116.58 → 3116.78] does
[3116.78 → 3117.02] not
[3117.02 → 3117.46] judge
[3117.46 → 3118.06] sin
[3118.06 → 3118.62] then
[3118.62 → 3119.18] he
[3119.18 → 3119.36] is
[3119.36 → 3119.54] not
[3119.54 → 3119.82] holy
[3119.82 → 3120.00] and
[3120.00 → 3120.38] just
[3120.38 → 3122.84] and
[3122.84 → 3123.00] so
[3123.00 → 3123.16] if
[3123.16 → 3123.58] people
[3123.58 → 3124.20] us
[3124.20 → 3124.36] if
[3124.36 → 3124.50] we
[3124.50 → 3125.06] practice
[3125.06 → 3125.56] such
[3125.56 → 3125.92] sins
[3125.92 → 3126.10] all
[3126.10 → 3126.26] the
[3126.26 → 3126.46] sins
[3126.46 → 3126.60] that
[3126.60 → 3126.74] he
[3126.74 → 3127.06] listed
[3127.06 → 3127.32] and
[3127.32 → 3127.50] we
[3127.50 → 3127.90] do
[3127.90 → 3128.46] and
[3128.46 → 3128.60] we
[3128.60 → 3128.72] are
[3128.72 → 3128.94] all
[3128.94 → 3129.36] guilty
[3129.36 → 3130.40] nobody
[3130.40 → 3130.90] will
[3130.90 → 3131.26] escape
[3131.26 → 3131.60] God's
[3131.60 → 3131.90] judgment
[3131.90 → 3133.46] we

[3308.08 → 3308.60] says
[3308.60 → 3309.60] but
[3309.60 → 3309.96] because
[3309.96 → 3310.56] of
[3310.56 → 3310.76] your
[3310.76 → 3311.68] stubbornness
[3311.68 → 3312.10] and

[3317.14 → 3317.44] God's
[3317.44 → 3317.76] wrath

[3323.88 → 3324.08] of
[3324.08 → 3324.36] judgment

[3325.66 → 3325.76] the
[3325.76 → 3326.08] future
[3326.08 → 3328.12] and
[3328.12 → 3328.36] in
[3328.36 → 3328.54] our
[3328.54 → 3329.66] repentance
[3329.66 → 3330.46] we
[3330.46 → 3330.72] are
[3330.72 → 3330.98] in
[3330.98 → 3331.40] danger
[3331.40 → 3332.40] of
[3332.40 → 3332.72] God's
[3332.72 → 3332.98] judgment

[3335.52 → 3335.68] we
[3335.68 → 3335.90] have
[3335.90 → 3336.06] if
[3336.06 → 3336.22] we're
[3336.22 → 3336.64] stubborn
[3336.64 → 3337.22] if
[3337.22 → 3337.30] we
[3337.30 → 3337.40] have
[3337.40 → 3337.58] these
[3337.58 → 3338.54] unrepentant
[3338.54 → 3338.98] hearts
[3338.98 → 3339.88] okay
[3339.88 → 3340.68] a great
[3340.68 → 3341.24] illustration
[3341.24 → 3342.02] of this
[3342.02 → 3342.46] is from
[3342.46 → 3342.64] the
[3343.34 → 3344.02] Indiana Jones
[3344.02 → 3344.70] and the
[3344.70 → 3345.04] last
[3345.04 → 3345.48] crusade
[3345.48 → 3346.32] have
[3346.32 → 3346.54] you have seen

[3352.00 → 3352.42] end of the
[3352.42 → 3352.72] movie
[3352.72 → 3353.00] right
[3353.00 → 3353.62] Indiana Jones
[3353.62 → 3354.04] is going
[3354.04 → 3354.36] through
[3354.36 → 3355.12] these tunnels
[3355.12 → 3355.96] he's
[3355.96 → 3356.92] and he's
[3356.92 → 3357.50] facing these
[3357.50 → 3357.92] dangerous
[3357.92 → 3358.42] trials
[3358.42 → 3358.76] there's like
[3358.76 → 3359.30] booby traps
[3359.30 → 3360.60] so he's
[3360.60 → 3360.82] in this
[3360.82 → 3361.12] cave
[3361.12 → 3361.50] system
[3361.50 → 3362.18] and he's
[3362.18 → 3362.30] got
[3362.30 → 3362.46] all
[3362.46 → 3362.66] these
[3362.66 → 3363.02] traps
[3363.02 → 3363.16] that
[3363.16 → 3363.22] have
[3363.22 → 3363.34] been
[3363.34 → 3363.58] set
[3363.58 → 3363.78] up
[3363.78 → 3363.98] to
[3363.98 → 3364.46] protect
[3364.46 → 3366.26] the
[3366.26 → 3366.48] thing
[3366.48 → 3366.80] what is
[3366.80 → 3367.00] it
[3367.00 → 3367.40] the
[3367.40 → 3367.54] holy
[3367.54 → 3367.84] grail
[3367.84 → 3368.38] I can't
[3368.38 → 3368.64] remember
[3368.64 → 3369.12] but there
[3369.12 → 3369.26] are all
[3369.26 → 3369.40] these
[3369.40 → 3369.76] traps
[3369.76 → 3370.74] and the
[3370.74 → 3371.06] first
[3371.06 → 3371.54] test
[3371.54 → 3371.90] he must
[3371.90 → 3372.24] pass
[3372.24 → 3372.56] through
[3372.56 → 3373.98] all he
[3373.98 → 3374.36] has
[3374.36 → 3374.70] is this
[3374.70 → 3375.14] clue
[3375.14 → 3375.50] from
[3375.50 → 3375.64] this
[3375.64 → 3375.84] old
[3375.84 → 3376.22] diary
[3376.22 → 3377.30] and the
[3377.30 → 3377.66] clue
[3377.66 → 3378.46] says
[3378.46 → 3379.72] the
[3379.72 → 3380.46] penitent
[3380.46 → 3380.98] man
[3380.98 → 3381.50] will
[3381.50 → 3381.98] pass
[3381.98 → 3382.96] that's
[3382.96 → 3383.08] the
[3383.08 → 3383.32] clue
[3383.32 → 3384.00] the
[3384.00 → 3384.42] penitent
[3384.42 → 3384.64] man
[3384.64 → 3384.78] will
[3384.78 → 3385.12] pass
[3385.12 → 3385.86] so he's
[3385.86 → 3386.32] walking
[3386.32 → 3386.84] through
[3386.84 → 3387.06] these
[3387.06 → 3387.42] tunnels
[3387.42 → 3388.04] he's
[3388.04 → 3388.40] whispering
[3388.40 → 3388.72] to
[3388.72 → 3389.16] himself
[3389.16 → 3389.72] this
[3389.72 → 3389.96] phrase
[3389.96 → 3390.24] over
[3390.24 → 3390.36] and
[3390.36 → 3390.48] over
[3390.48 → 3390.66] the
[3390.66 → 3390.98] penitent
[3390.98 → 3391.18] man
[3391.18 → 3391.28] will
[3391.28 → 3391.52] pass
[3391.52 → 3392.92] he's
[3392.92 → 3393.10] trying
[3393.10 → 3393.22] to
[3393.22 → 3393.36] figure
[3393.36 → 3393.60] out
[3393.60 → 3393.86] how
[3393.86 → 3394.04] is
[3394.04 → 3394.16] this
[3394.16 → 3394.28] going
[3394.28 → 3394.34] to
[3394.34 → 3394.50] help
[3394.50 → 3394.72] me
[3394.72 → 3395.22] pass
[3395.22 → 3395.38] this
[3395.38 → 3395.72] trial
[3395.72 → 3397.34] and
[3397.34 → 3397.60] just
[3397.60 → 3397.76] at
[3397.76 → 3397.88] the
[3397.88 → 3398.08] right
[3398.08 → 3398.50] moment
[3398.50 → 3399.18] he
[3399.18 → 3399.92] realizes
[3399.92 → 3401.14] a
[3401.14 → 3401.78] penitent
[3401.78 → 3402.24] man
[3402.24 → 3402.60] a
[3402.60 → 3403.00] penitent
[3403.00 → 3403.38] person
[3403.38 → 3404.68] is
[3404.68 → 3404.94] on
[3404.94 → 3405.22] his
[3405.22 → 3405.64] knees
[3405.64 → 3405.84] in
[3405.84 → 3406.36] humility
[3406.36 → 3406.76] before
[3406.76 → 3407.18] God
[3407.18 → 3407.96] and
[3407.96 → 3408.12] of
[3408.12 → 3408.42] course
[3408.42 → 3408.82] he
[3408.82 → 3409.42] drops
[3409.42 → 3409.64] to
[3409.64 → 3409.92] his
[3409.92 → 3410.24] knees
[3410.24 → 3410.60] right
[3410.60 → 3411.02] as
[3411.02 → 3411.24] a
[3411.24 → 3411.50] saw
[3411.50 → 3411.82] blade
[3411.82 → 3412.64] swooping
[3412.64 → 3412.98] over
[3412.98 → 3414.16] and
[3414.16 → 3414.42] would
[3414.42 → 3414.80] have
[3414.80 → 3415.56] slashed
[3415.56 → 3415.74] where
[3415.74 → 3415.92] his
[3415.92 → 3416.16] neck
[3416.16 → 3416.38] would
[3416.38 → 3416.58] have
[3416.58 → 3416.86] been
[3416.86 → 3419.98] I
[3419.98 → 3420.14] think
[3420.14 → 3420.32] that's
[3420.32 → 3420.38] a
[3420.38 → 3420.50] good
[3420.50 → 3420.78] model
[3420.78 → 3421.00] for
[3421.00 → 3421.40] us
[3421.40 → 3423.84] that's
[3423.84 → 3423.98] what
[3423.98 → 3424.12] it
[3424.12 → 3424.48] says
[3424.48 → 3426.18] the
[3426.18 → 3426.78] penitent
[3426.78 → 3427.04] one
[3427.04 → 3427.26] shall
[3427.26 → 3427.68] pass
[3427.68 → 3429.66] maybe
[3429.66 → 3429.88] we
[3429.88 → 3430.04] need
[3430.04 → 3430.18] to
[3430.18 → 3430.40] whisper
[3430.40 → 3430.66] this
[3430.66 → 3430.94] over
[3430.94 → 3431.16] and
[3431.16 → 3431.42] over
[3431.42 → 3431.66] to
[3431.66 → 3432.22] ourselves
[3432.22 → 3433.34] as
[3433.34 → 3433.44] a
[3433.44 → 3433.78] reminder
[3433.78 → 3434.02] to
[3434.02 → 3434.54] ourselves
[3434.54 → 3435.94] right
[3435.94 → 3436.22] the
[3436.22 → 3436.68] humble
[3436.68 → 3437.96] those
[3437.96 → 3438.96] who
[3438.96 → 3439.68] realize
[3439.68 → 3440.06] their
[3440.06 → 3440.60] sin
[3440.60 → 3441.56] that
[3441.56 → 3441.92] they
[3441.92 → 3442.68] don't
[3442.68 → 3443.24] excuse
[3443.24 → 3443.76] themselves
[3443.76 → 3444.04] from
[3444.04 → 3444.18] the
[3444.18 → 3444.56] common
[3444.56 → 3445.02] misery
[3445.02 → 3445.24] of
[3445.24 → 3445.48] sin
[3445.48 → 3445.66] that
[3445.66 → 3446.06] humanity
[3446.06 → 3446.34] is
[3446.34 → 3446.62] in
[3446.62 → 3447.46] but
[3447.46 → 3447.70] those
[3447.70 → 3447.84] who
[3447.84 → 3448.16] realize
[3448.16 → 3448.36] that
[3448.36 → 3448.92] they
[3448.92 → 3449.98] need
[3449.98 → 3450.66] God's
[3450.66 → 3450.98] mercy
[3450.98 → 3451.34] as
[3451.34 → 3451.90] much
[3451.90 → 3452.56] if
[3452.56 → 3452.76] not
[3452.76 → 3453.10] more
[3453.10 → 3453.64] than
[3453.64 → 3453.98] anyone
[3453.98 → 3454.38] else
[3454.38 → 3455.76] and
[3455.76 → 3455.90] it
[3455.90 → 3456.20] leads
[3456.20 → 3456.58] them
[3456.58 → 3457.98] to
[3457.98 → 3458.34] run
[3458.34 → 3458.56] to
[3458.56 → 3459.08] God
[3459.08 → 3460.52] who
[3460.52 → 3460.88] is
[3460.88 → 3461.34] patient
[3461.34 → 3461.54] and
[3461.54 → 3461.86] kind
[3461.86 → 3464.10] right
[3464.10 → 3464.38] because
[3464.38 → 3464.54] you
[3464.54 → 3464.72] see
[3464.72 → 3465.30] God's
[3465.30 → 3465.94] kindness
[3465.94 → 3466.12] and
[3466.12 → 3466.26] his
[3466.26 → 3466.66] patience
[3466.66 → 3466.84] is
[3466.84 → 3467.02] not
[3467.02 → 3467.22] just
[3467.22 → 3467.52] like
[3467.52 → 3468.18] a
[3468.18 → 3468.44] get
[3468.44 → 3468.66] out
[3468.66 → 3468.78] of
[3468.78 → 3468.94] jail
[3468.94 → 3469.26] free
[3469.26 → 3469.68] card
[3469.68 → 3470.02] right
[3470.02 → 3470.84] is
[3470.84 → 3471.48] God's
[3471.48 → 3472.06] grace
[3472.06 → 3472.52] because
[3472.52 → 3472.72] he
[3472.72 → 3472.96] hasn't
[3472.96 → 3473.32] struck
[3473.32 → 3473.44] you
[3473.44 → 3473.58] with
[3473.58 → 3473.84] lightning
[3473.84 → 3474.34] immediately
[3474.34 → 3474.90] it
[3474.90 → 3475.14] doesn't
[3475.14 → 3475.32] mean
[3475.32 → 3475.52] he's
[3475.52 → 3475.64] not
[3475.64 → 3475.84] paying
[3475.84 → 3476.22] attention
[3476.22 → 3476.84] or
[3476.84 → 3477.06] that
[3477.06 → 3477.24] he
[3477.24 → 3477.86] doesn't
[3477.86 → 3478.58] care
[3478.58 → 3479.76] about
[3479.76 → 3480.16] sin
[3480.16 → 3480.36] or
[3480.36 → 3480.52] that

[3657.36 → 3657.68] sin
[3657.68 → 3658.32] and
[3658.32 → 3658.58] help
[3658.58 → 3658.70] us
[3658.70 → 3658.86] to
[3658.86 → 3659.08] turn
[3659.08 → 3659.28] away
[3659.28 → 3659.54] from
[3659.54 → 3659.74] it
[3659.74 → 3661.54] and
[3661.54 → 3661.66] I
[3661.66 → 3661.86] pray
[3661.86 → 3662.24] that
[3662.24 → 3662.68] for
[3662.68 → 3662.90] all
[3662.90 → 3663.02] of
[3663.02 → 3663.24] those
[3663.24 → 3663.60] here
[3663.60 → 3663.84] who
[3663.84 → 3664.06] may
[3664.06 → 3664.36] not
[3664.36 → 3664.72] know
[3664.72 → 3664.96] you
[3664.96 → 3665.32] yet
[3665.32 → 3665.70] that
[3665.70 → 3666.04] this
[3666.04 → 3666.22] would
[3666.22 → 3666.34] be
[3666.34 → 3666.54] the
[3666.54 → 3666.80] day
[3666.80 → 3667.06] that
[3667.06 → 3667.20] they
[3667.20 → 3667.40] would
[3667.40 → 3667.64] see
[3667.64 → 3667.82] that
[3667.82 → 3668.00] your
[3668.00 → 3668.36] judgment
[3668.36 → 3668.76] is
[3668.76 → 3670.36] inescapable
[3670.36 → 3672.12] but
[3672.12 → 3672.46] because
[3672.46 → 3672.62] of
[3672.62 → 3672.74] your
[3672.74 → 3673.14] kindness
[3673.14 → 3673.34] and
[3673.34 → 3673.48] your
[3673.48 → 3673.84] patience
[3673.84 → 3674.00] you
[3674.00 → 3674.12] have
[3674.12 → 3674.50] provided
[3674.50 → 3674.70] a
[3674.70 → 3674.90] way
[3674.90 → 3676.48] you
[3676.48 → 3676.78] Lord
[3676.78 → 3676.98] are
[3676.98 → 3677.16] the
[3677.16 → 3677.58] solution
[3677.58 → 3678.76] we
[3678.76 → 3679.06] pray
[3679.06 → 3679.40] these
[3679.40 → 3679.72] things
[3679.72 → 3679.90] in
[3679.90 → 3680.12] Jesus
[3680.12 → 3680.60] Christ's
[3680.60 → 3680.76] name
[3680.76 → 3681.60] amen
[3681.60 → 3685.42] so
[3685.42 → 3685.68] let's
[3685.68 → 3686.00] stand
[3686.00 → 3686.16] and
[3686.16 → 3686.36] let's
[3686.36 → 3686.66] sing
[3686.66 → 3687.16] of
[3687.16 → 3687.64] God's
[3687.64 → 3687.98] grace
[3687.98 → 3688.28] to
[3688.28 → 3688.72] us
[3688.72 → 3689.50] in
[3689.50 → 3689.88] our
[3689.88 → 3690.74] next
[3690.74 → 3690.96] song
[3690.96 → 3691.16] let's
[3691.16 → 3691.32] stand
[3691.32 → 3691.46] and
[3691.46 → 3691.64] sing
[3691.64 → 3693.64] Lord
[3693.64 → 3709.92] I
[3709.92 → 3711.76] come
[3711.76 → 3712.96] I
[3712.96 → 3714.78] request
[3714.78 → 3716.42] now in

[3721.44 → 3723.12] about
[3723.12 → 3724.48] you
[3724.48 → 3725.58] I
[3725.58 → 3726.22] fall
[3726.22 → 3728.08] apart
[3728.08 → 3729.26] nor
[3729.26 → 3729.66] the
[3729.66 → 3731.00] one
[3731.00 → 3732.14] that
[3732.14 → 3732.86] dies
[3732.86 → 3733.44] my
[3733.44 → 3735.16] heart
[3735.16 → 3739.26] Lord
[3739.26 → 3739.68] I
[3739.68 → 3740.56] need
[3740.56 → 3741.20] you
[3741.20 → 3742.10] Lord
[3742.10 → 3742.86] I
[3742.86 → 3744.52] need
[3744.52 → 3745.40] you
[3745.40 → 3747.70] every
[3747.70 → 3748.68] hour
[3748.68 → 3749.40] I
[3749.40 → 3750.40] need
[3750.40 → 3751.40] you
[3751.40 → 3752.86] my
[3752.86 → 3753.40] one
[3753.40 → 3754.40] defence
[3754.40 → 3755.40] my
[3755.40 → 3757.40] righteousness
[3757.40 → 3758.40] oh
[3758.40 → 3760.40] God
[3760.40 → 3761.40] how I
[3761.40 → 3762.40] need
[3762.40 → 3763.40] you
[3763.40 → 3764.40] you
[3764.40 → 3765.40] you
[3765.40 → 3766.40] you
[3766.40 → 3770.40] you
[3770.40 → 3771.40] you
[3771.40 → 3772.40] you
[3772.40 → 3772.78] praise
[3772.78 → 3773.40] is
[3773.40 → 3773.62] for
[3773.62 → 3774.40] where
[3774.40 → 3776.18] grace is
[3776.18 → 3777.64] found
[3777.64 → 3778.58] is
[3778.58 → 3779.28] where
[3779.28 → 3779.86] you
[3779.86 → 3781.20] are
[3781.20 → 3782.02] and
[3782.02 → 3782.40] where
[3782.40 → 3782.82] you
[3782.82 → 3784.34] are
[3784.34 → 3785.34] you
[3785.34 → 3786.34] you
[3786.34 → 3787.34] Lord
[3787.34 → 3788.34] I
[3788.34 → 3789.34] need
[3789.34 → 3791.34] you
[3791.34 → 3792.34] for
[3792.34 → 3793.34] you
[3793.34 → 3795.34] you
[3795.34 → 3796.34] are
[3796.34 → 3797.34] you
[3797.34 → 3798.34] Lord
[3798.34 → 3799.34] I
[3799.34 → 3800.34] am
[3800.34 → 3801.34] free
[3801.34 → 3802.34] forgiveness
[3802.34 → 3804.34] you
[3804.34 → 3807.34] I
[3807.34 → 3808.34] need
[3808.34 → 3809.34] your
[3809.34 → 3810.30] 心
[3811.34 → 3812.32] who
[3812.32 → 3817.92] I need you, oh, I need you.
[3818.66 → 3824.22] Every hour I need you.
[3824.76 → 3830.06] My one defence, my righteousness.
[3831.16 → 3835.16] Oh, God, how I need you.
[3836.82 → 3841.30] So take my soul to rise to you.
[3842.32 → 3848.36] When temptation comes my way.
[3848.68 → 3852.48] And when I cannot stand, I'll follow you.
[3854.34 → 3858.28] Jesus, you're my hope and save.
[3859.50 → 3863.36] And when I cannot stand, I'll follow you.
[3865.46 → 3869.96] Jesus, you're my hope and save.
[3869.96 → 3876.12] Lord, I need you.
[3876.32 → 3880.00] Oh, I need you.
[3881.04 → 3886.42] Every hour I need you.
[3886.42 → 3892.28] My one defence, my righteousness.
[3892.28 → 3897.76] Oh, God, how I need you.
[3898.64 → 3901.60] Lord, I need you.
[3901.84 → 3905.82] Oh, I need you.
[3906.60 → 3912.22] Every hour I need you.
[3912.22 → 3918.58] My one defence, my righteousness.
[3918.58 → 3924.22] Oh, God, how I need you.
[3924.22 → 3947.12] Our offering this morning is for the Seafarers Literature Fund.
[3947.12 → 3952.18] and that's a fund that seeks to put scripture and Christian music
[3952.18 → 3957.94] and other minor small creature comforts in the hands of seafarers around the globe.
[3958.44 → 3961.26] So I'll invite the deacons to come forward and receive our offerings at this time.
[3961.26 → 3980.18] Waiting for angry words to sear my soul
[3980.18 → 3988.68] Knowing I don't deserve another chance
[3988.68 → 3996.98] Suddenly the kindest words I've ever heard
[3996.98 → 4003.58] Come flooding through my heart
[4003.58 → 4012.50] It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord
[4012.50 → 4020.50] Knowing that you love us no matter what we do
[4020.50 → 4025.50] Makes us want to love you
[4025.50 → 4033.50] It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord
[4033.50 → 4041.50] Knowing that you love us no matter what we do
[4041.50 → 4049.50] Makes us want to love you too
[4049.50 → 4059.60] No excuse, no one to blame
[4059.60 → 4063.88] Nowhere to hide
[4063.88 → 4072.18] The eyes of God have found my failure, found my pain
[4072.18 → 4080.88] He understands my weaknesses and knows my shame
[4080.88 → 4086.88] But his heart never leaves me
[4086.88 → 4087.88] But his heart never leaves me
[4087.88 → 4095.88] It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord
[4095.88 → 4101.88] Knowing that you love us no matter what we do
[4101.88 → 4103.88] No matter what we do
[4103.88 → 4108.88] Makes us want to love you
[4108.88 → 4116.88] It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord
[4116.88 → 4122.88] Knowing that you love us no matter what we do
[4122.88 → 4124.88] No matter what we do
[4124.88 → 4129.88] Makes us want to love you too
[4129.88 → 4150.88] Love you too
[4150.88 → 4159.88] It's time that we can come to God in prayer, communally, this morning. And just a note that at the conclusion of the prayer, unannounced,
[4159.88 → 4163.88] We will be singing the Lord's Prayer together
[4163.88 → 4168.88] And lucky you, it will be Marian and the praise team leading us in that, not me
[4168.88 → 4173.88] So, let's join in prayer
[4177.88 → 4182.88] Lord our God, we thank you for this time together
[4182.88 → 4184.88] We thank you for the voices raised in song
[4184.88 → 4187.88] The talent that brings music to this place
[4187.88 → 4190.88] We thank you for the message this morning
[4190.88 → 4193.88] We pray we can take it to heart
[4193.88 → 4196.88] And leave judgment in your fair and just hands
[4196.88 → 4199.88] We pray that your spirit will work in all our hearts
[4199.88 → 4205.88] That we can truly seek to serve you and do your will in all aspects of our lives
[4205.88 → 4207.88] Including our relationships with the one other
[4207.88 → 4218.88] We pray for the earth, for the oceans and farmlands, for the forests and tundras, for the lands and crops that feed, clothe, heal and house us
[4218.88 → 4225.88] We grieve the devastation of the planet, both the destruction caused by natural disasters and by our own pollution
[4225.88 → 4230.88] We pray this morning for all those affected by the heavy rains these last few days
[4230.88 → 4234.88] With reports of localized flooding as creeks and drains overflow
[4234.88 → 4237.88] Please keep all those impacted by this
[4237.88 → 4241.88] And those working to minimize damage safe as rains continue today
[4241.88 → 4244.88] We pray for all people
[4244.88 → 4248.88] Of all ages, races, genders, religions and walks of life
[4248.88 → 4252.88] We rejoice in the diversity that brings beauty to our communities
[4252.88 → 4255.88] And grieve the prejudice that destroys them
[4255.88 → 4262.88] We ask that you break down every dividing wall and make us into one people loving and beloved
[4262.88 → 4268.88] We pray for an end to the terrible wars that continue in Ukraine and Gaza
[4268.88 → 4271.88] For the threat of war in other regions
[4271.88 → 4275.88] It seems that the drums of war grow louder with each passing day
[4275.88 → 4282.88] We pray for your wisdom to be granted to the leaders to bring an end to the violence and find a path to peace
[4282.88 → 4286.88] We pray for the church throughout the world
[4286.88 → 4289.88] Strengthen her in service, witness and love
[4289.88 → 4293.88] Give her energy and vision for the future you are guiding her into
[4293.88 → 4296.88] Heal her divisions and save her from isolating fear
[4296.88 → 4299.88] Grow her into your holy body
[4299.88 → 4303.88] We pray especially this morning for the work of the Seafarers Literature Fund
[4303.88 → 4309.88] Please bless these efforts to provide scriptures and their comforts to seafarers in many ports
[4309.88 → 4318.88] We pray for Marian and Don Tendril as they prepare to spend November working with Hannah Vanderkamp's language ministry in Greece
[4318.88 → 4324.88] Please bless that ministry in its efforts among refugees displaced by war and persecution
[4324.88 → 4327.88] May the Tendrils be a blessing to Hannah and the refugees
[4327.88 → 4331.88] Closer to home we pray for classes this coming week
[4331.88 → 4339.88] Give our delegates Pastor Jason, Joe Chalk and Bill Vermeer safety and wisdom in their two days at this event
[4340.88 → 4345.88] We pray for all those who are sick today whose bodies are worn and weary
[4345.88 → 4350.88] We pray especially for those suffering illnesses the world would often rather not acknowledge
[4350.88 → 4355.88] For those whose illness brings stigma and shame from their community rather than support and healing
[4355.88 → 4362.88] Bless the sick with peace and courage and those who take care of them with energy, wisdom and compassion
[4362.88 → 4369.88] We hold before you this morning Henry Vukteveen and pray that her rehab in White Rock from hip surgery goes well
[4369.88 → 4374.88] We also pray for continued healing for Kukri and pray that in due time
[4374.88 → 4379.88] He will be able to return to work as a significant step on his long road to recovery
[4379.88 → 4386.88] We praise you that Michaela and Jason are expecting a baby in February and pray for your blessing on them
[4386.88 → 4388.88] And on the child as it grows
[4389.88 → 4395.88] We also pray for Robin's sister Judy who has mobility issues and difficult time communicating and
[4396.88 → 4400.88] The 24-hour day care that necessitates and the load that puts on her husband
[4400.88 → 4402.88] Pray you bless both of those and give them strength
[4402.88 → 4406.88] And be near us Lord through this coming week
[4406.88 → 4409.88] Help us to be effective servants to you
[4409.88 → 4414.88] And that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom
[4415.88 → 4421.88] We offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate name of Jesus the light of the world
[4421.88 → 4423.88] Amen
[4436.88 → 4441.88] Father let your kingdom come
[4441.88 → 4444.88] Father let your will be done
[4444.88 → 4448.88] Oh Lord God in heaven
[4448.88 → 4451.88] Right here in my heart
[4451.88 → 4455.88] Father let your kingdom come
[4455.88 → 4458.88] Father let your will be done
[4458.88 → 4461.88] Oh Lord God in heaven
[4461.88 → 4462.88] My dear in my heart
[4462.88 → 4468.88] Give us to stay and deliver
[4468.88 → 4471.88] Forgive us
[4471.88 → 4472.88] Forgive us
[4472.88 → 4473.88] Forgive us
[4473.88 → 4478.88] As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
[4478.88 → 4479.88] Forgive them
[4479.88 → 4483.88] Forgive us not into temptation
[4483.88 → 4486.88] But deliver us
[4486.88 → 4488.88] From the one
[4488.88 → 4515.88] God
[4515.88 → 4517.88] us in heaven
[4517.88 → 4521.62] right here in my heart
[4521.62 → 4524.12] give us this day
[4524.12 → 4525.86] a deadly prayer
[4525.86 → 4527.30] forgive us
[4527.30 → 4529.10] forgive us
[4529.10 → 4531.94] as we forgive the ones
[4531.94 → 4534.28] who sinned against us
[4534.28 → 4535.96] forgive them
[4535.96 → 4538.36] and lead us not
[4538.36 → 4539.80] to temptation
[4539.80 → 4543.40] but deliver us
[4543.40 → 4545.86] from the little one
[4545.86 → 4549.68] let your kingdom come
[4549.68 → 4552.24] it's yours
[4552.24 → 4553.94] it's yours
[4553.94 → 4555.68] all yours
[4555.68 → 4557.30] all yours
[4557.30 → 4558.88] the kingdom
[4558.88 → 4560.64] the power
[4560.64 → 4562.38] the glory
[4562.38 → 4564.10] are yours
[4564.10 → 4565.64] it's yours
[4565.64 → 4567.38] it's yours
[4567.38 → 4569.06] all yours
[4569.06 → 4570.68] all yours
[4570.68 → 4574.18] forever and ever
[4574.18 → 4575.70] the kingdom
[4575.70 → 4575.72] the kingdom
[4575.72 → 4577.50] is yours
