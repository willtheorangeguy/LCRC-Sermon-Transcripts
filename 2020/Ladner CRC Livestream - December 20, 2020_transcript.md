[370.38 --> 400.36]  Thank you.
[401.28 --> 428.34]  And comuns.
[428.34 --> 434.06]  May the Lord make his holy face to shine upon us in this time of Advent worship.
[435.12 --> 439.84]  May we see God's face and sow no peace. Amen.
[441.18 --> 443.14]  God greets us with these words.
[444.48 --> 449.00]  As we enter this fourth Sunday of Advent, may the love of God the Father
[449.00 --> 454.42]  and the grace of Jesus the Son and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[454.42 --> 458.18]  be and abide with us all. Amen.
[458.34 --> 459.34]  Amen.
[488.34 --> 518.34] 
[518.34 --> 525.34]  My soul, my joy, my crown.
[527.34 --> 537.34]  Fair are the meadows, fair are the woodlands,
[537.34 --> 546.34]  O pink flowers of blooming spring.
[546.34 --> 556.34]  Jesus is fair, Jesus is pure.
[557.34 --> 566.34]  He makes our sorrowing spirit sing.
[566.34 --> 579.34]  Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations,
[579.34 --> 589.34]  Son of God, O Son of Man.
[589.34 --> 599.34]  Glory and honor, grace and adoration,
[600.34 --> 608.34]  Now and forevermore divine.
[608.34 --> 611.34]  May our hearts.
[611.34 --> 613.34]  Amen.
[613.34 --> 614.34]  Amen.
[614.34 --> 628.72]  For you alone, our souls,
[628.72 --> 645.22]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[647.22 --> 653.22]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[654.72 --> 658.22]  Truly our hope is in you.
[659.22 --> 663.22]  Truly our hope is in you.
[665.12 --> 672.72]  O Lord of life, our only hope, your radiant shines on all.
[672.72 --> 682.82]  Who look to you in the dark, Emmanuel, come, come right to us.
[682.82 --> 691.22]  O Lord of life, our only hope, your radiant shines on all.
[691.22 --> 699.32]  Who look to you in the dark, Emmanuel, come, come light your heart.
[699.32 --> 707.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[707.32 --> 737.32] 
[737.32 --> 739.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[739.32 --> 743.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[743.32 --> 745.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.

[755.32 --> 757.32]  Truly our hope is in you.
[757.32 --> 759.32]  Truly our hope is in you.
[759.32 --> 761.32]  In you.
[761.32 --> 763.32]  Truly our hope is in you.
[763.32 --> 793.32] 
[793.32 --> 801.32]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[801.32 --> 815.82]  For you, O Lord.
[815.82 --> 826.82]  O come, O come, Emmanuel,
[826.82 --> 833.82]  and ransom God to this man
[833.82 --> 841.82]  that roars him all the acts of him.
[841.82 --> 849.82]  Until the Son of God appear.
[849.82 --> 854.82]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[854.82 --> 867.82]  Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[867.82 --> 875.82]  O come, O wisdom from on high,
[875.82 --> 882.82]  O order, all things mightily.
[882.82 --> 890.82]  To us the path of knowledge show,
[890.82 --> 897.82]  and teach us in its ways to go.
[897.82 --> 903.82]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[903.82 --> 914.82]  Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[914.82 --> 924.82]  O come, O the branch of justice,
[924.82 --> 932.82]  and ask them until thy hold and rescue them.
[932.82 --> 940.82]  From depths of thy own people stay,
[940.82 --> 948.82]  and build them victory o'er the grave.
[948.82 --> 953.82]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[953.82 --> 963.82]  Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[963.82 --> 973.82]  O Israel.
[973.82 --> 978.82]  As we anticipate the birth of Jesus Christ,
[978.82 --> 983.82]  we light the candles of hope, love, and peace,
[983.82 --> 987.82]  as reminders of the promise that Emmanuel is our God with us,
[987.82 --> 991.82]  and that God graciously gives us these gifts.
[991.82 --> 1007.82]  O Israel.
[1007.82 --> 1009.82]  On this fourth Sunday of Advent,
[1009.82 --> 1011.82]  we light the candle of joy.
[1011.82 --> 1015.82]  We fix our eyes on Jesus Christ,
[1015.82 --> 1019.82]  the author and perfecter of our faith.
[1019.82 --> 1022.82]  For the joy set before him,
[1022.82 --> 1025.82]  he came down to earth,
[1025.82 --> 1027.82]  and took on our humanity,
[1027.82 --> 1029.82]  endured the cross with all its shame,
[1029.82 --> 1033.82]  and sat down at the right hand of God in heaven.
[1033.82 --> 1039.82]  The day is coming when there will be everlasting joy to the world.
[1039.82 --> 1043.82]  For our Lord will come.
[1043.82 --> 1046.82]  Let all the earth receive our King.
[1046.82 --> 1052.82]  We light the candle of joy in anticipation of that day.
[1063.82 --> 1076.82]  Please join me in this prayer of confession for Advent.
[1076.82 --> 1081.82]  O God, you search us out, and you know us,
[1081.82 --> 1084.82]  and all that we are is open to you.
[1084.82 --> 1088.82]  We confess that we have sinned.
[1088.82 --> 1093.82]  In your mercy, Lord, forgive us and heal us.
[1093.82 --> 1096.82]  You came to us as a baby,
[1096.82 --> 1101.82]  leaving your heavenly throne to be born of a poor young woman of Nazareth,
[1101.82 --> 1105.82]  and yet we live as though you were never here.
[1105.82 --> 1110.82]  In your mercy, Lord, forgive and heal us.
[1110.82 --> 1115.82]  When we long for your coming to change the world,
[1115.82 --> 1119.82]  and yet are unwilling to change even our own hearts,
[1119.82 --> 1125.82]  in your mercy, Lord, forgive and heal us.
[1125.82 --> 1128.82]  When we do not make straight paths for justice,
[1128.82 --> 1132.82]  nor offer a welcome when you come as a stranger,
[1132.82 --> 1137.82]  in your mercy, Lord, forgive and heal us.
[1137.82 --> 1141.82]  When we ignore you as the sure fulfillment of the law,
[1141.82 --> 1145.82]  and refuse to nourish your seed within us,
[1145.82 --> 1150.82]  in your mercy, Lord, forgive and heal us.
[1150.82 --> 1155.82]  When we do not acknowledge your great price for our redemption,
[1155.82 --> 1158.82]  and the mystery of your resurrection,
[1158.82 --> 1163.82]  in your mercy, Lord, forgive and heal us.
[1163.82 --> 1167.82]  We turn to you, O God of infinite mercy.
[1167.82 --> 1169.82]  We renounce evil.
[1169.82 --> 1171.82]  We claim your love.
[1171.82 --> 1176.82]  We put our hope in you, in your birth, in your death,
[1176.82 --> 1181.82]  in your resurrection, and in your second coming.
[1181.82 --> 1184.82]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[1184.82 --> 1188.82]  Here are these words of assurance.
[1188.82 --> 1196.82]  The good news of this Advent season is forgiveness of sin and new life.
[1196.82 --> 1202.82]  Let us commit our lives to Christ's way of hope and peace.
[1202.82 --> 1207.82]  Thanks be to the Advent God who comes among us,
[1207.82 --> 1210.82]  setting us free to love and serve.
[1212.82 --> 1216.82]  Grace unmeasured, love untold.
[1216.82 --> 1219.82]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[1219.82 --> 1220.82]  Amen.
[1220.82 --> 1229.82]  God bless you all.
[1229.82 --> 1234.82]  Amen.
[1234.82 --> 1235.82]  Amen.
[1235.82 --> 1240.82]  Amen.
[1240.82 --> 1241.82]  Amen.
[1241.82 --> 1242.82]  Amen.
[1242.82 --> 1245.82]  Amen.
[1245.82 --> 1254.46]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1254.46 --> 1259.32]  In the dawning of the King
[1259.32 --> 1264.02]  In a theme of heaven's praises
[1264.02 --> 1267.62]  Robbed in frail humanity
[1267.62 --> 1273.52]  In our longing, in our darkness
[1273.52 --> 1278.54]  Now their light of life has come
[1278.54 --> 1283.38]  Look to Christ who condescended
[1283.38 --> 1289.02]  Took on flesh, true, and some eyes
[1289.02 --> 1295.00]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1295.00 --> 1300.14]  He, the perfect Son of Man
[1300.14 --> 1305.16]  In His living, in His suffering
[1305.16 --> 1310.00]  Never trace nor stain of sin
[1310.00 --> 1314.72]  See the true and better Adam
[1314.72 --> 1319.16]  Come to save the help of man
[1319.16 --> 1324.18]  Christ the great and sure fulfillment
[1324.18 --> 1329.20]  Of the law in Him we stand
[1329.20 --> 1335.24]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1335.24 --> 1340.20]  Christ the Lord upon the tree
[1340.20 --> 1344.20]  In the stead of ruined sinners
[1344.20 --> 1348.04]  Hangs the Lamb in victory
[1348.04 --> 1354.06]  See the rise of our redemption
[1354.06 --> 1359.18]  See the Father's plan unfold
[1359.18 --> 1363.74]  Bringing many songs to glory
[1363.74 --> 1368.94]  Grace unmeasured, love untold
[1368.94 --> 1384.96]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1384.96 --> 1389.98]  Slain by death, the God of life
[1389.98 --> 1393.82]  But no grace can err is pain
[1393.82 --> 1398.82]  Praise the Lord, He is alive
[1398.82 --> 1403.82]  What a foretaste of deliverance
[1403.82 --> 1408.84]  How unwavering the whole
[1408.84 --> 1413.84]  Christ in power, resurrection
[1413.84 --> 1419.80]  As we will be when He comes
[1419.80 --> 1424.82]  What a foretaste of deliverance
[1424.82 --> 1428.82]  How unwavering the whole
[1428.82 --> 1433.84]  Christ in power, resurrection
[1433.84 --> 1440.84]  As we will be when He comes
[1440.84 --> 1458.80]  Christ in power, resurrection
[1458.80 --> 1464.36]  Are you guys done singing?
[1466.66 --> 1468.46]  Okay, alright
[1468.46 --> 1479.46]  No, go ahead
[1479.46 --> 1485.70]  Good morning friends
[1485.70 --> 1487.98]  So as we have said already
[1487.98 --> 1489.96]  Today is the fourth Sunday
[1489.96 --> 1491.16]  Of the season of Advent
[1491.16 --> 1493.72]  And in this season
[1493.72 --> 1495.18]  We are considering the coming
[1495.18 --> 1496.36]  Of Jesus our King
[1496.36 --> 1499.14]  And looking at the first few chapters
[1499.14 --> 1500.20]  Of the Gospel of Luke
[1500.20 --> 1502.86]  Considering how Jesus is the King
[1502.86 --> 1503.60]  And when He comes
[1503.60 --> 1505.24]  He fulfills our deepest desires
[1505.24 --> 1507.24]  He fills our longings
[1507.24 --> 1508.92]  For grace and for joy
[1508.92 --> 1509.84]  And for mercy
[1509.84 --> 1511.50]  For peace, for salvation
[1511.50 --> 1513.98]  And so with that
[1513.98 --> 1515.02]  Today we are going to be reading
[1515.02 --> 1516.70]  A very familiar passage to us
[1516.70 --> 1521.54]  It is the angels' visit
[1521.54 --> 1522.30]  To the shepherds
[1522.30 --> 1524.48]  And so let's give our attention
[1524.48 --> 1526.06]  To the reading of God's word
[1526.06 --> 1527.52]  From Luke chapter 2
[1527.52 --> 1528.64]  Verses 8 to 14
[1528.64 --> 1530.82]  And we will have the scripture
[1530.82 --> 1532.06]  Up on the screen
[1532.06 --> 1536.68]  And there were shepherds
[1536.68 --> 1538.22]  Living out in the fields nearby
[1538.22 --> 1540.32]  Keeping watch over their flocks
[1540.32 --> 1540.74]  At night
[1540.74 --> 1542.72]  An angel of the Lord
[1542.72 --> 1543.50]  Appeared to them
[1543.50 --> 1544.82]  And the glory of the Lord
[1544.82 --> 1545.78]  Shone around them
[1545.78 --> 1547.44]  And they were terrified
[1547.44 --> 1550.64]  But the angel said to them
[1550.64 --> 1552.18]  Do not be afraid
[1552.18 --> 1554.14]  I bring you good news
[1554.14 --> 1555.56]  That will cause great joy
[1555.56 --> 1556.58]  For all the people
[1556.58 --> 1558.74]  Today in the town of David
[1558.74 --> 1561.80]  A Savior has been born to you
[1561.80 --> 1563.52]  He is the Messiah
[1563.52 --> 1564.58]  The Lord
[1564.58 --> 1566.68]  This will be a sign to you
[1566.68 --> 1567.82]  You will find a baby
[1567.82 --> 1569.04]  Wrapped in cloths
[1569.04 --> 1571.02]  And lying in a manger
[1571.02 --> 1577.28]  Suddenly a great company
[1577.28 --> 1578.40]  Of the heavenly host
[1578.40 --> 1579.84]  Appeared with the angel
[1579.84 --> 1581.14]  Praising God
[1581.14 --> 1582.56]  And saying glory to God
[1582.56 --> 1583.62]  In the highest heaven
[1583.62 --> 1585.60]  And on earth peace
[1585.60 --> 1587.38]  To those on whom
[1587.38 --> 1589.16]  His favor rests
[1589.16 --> 1592.38]  Okay
[1592.38 --> 1593.10]  So let's
[1593.10 --> 1594.20]  Let's pray together
[1594.20 --> 1595.66]  As we come before the Lord
[1595.66 --> 1599.12]  Our heavenly Father
[1599.12 --> 1600.48]  This morning
[1600.48 --> 1602.24]  We come before you
[1602.24 --> 1603.00]  As your people
[1603.00 --> 1604.92]  Those whom you have redeemed
[1604.92 --> 1605.72]  And Lord
[1605.72 --> 1606.74]  By your Holy Spirit
[1606.74 --> 1608.42]  We ask that you would
[1608.42 --> 1609.42]  Speak to us
[1609.42 --> 1610.86]  That you would open up
[1610.86 --> 1611.64]  Our ears
[1611.64 --> 1613.60]  That you would
[1613.60 --> 1615.10]  Tear down whatever
[1615.10 --> 1616.86]  Walls that we have
[1616.86 --> 1618.08]  Erected in our hearts
[1618.08 --> 1619.96]  Lord that your spirit
[1619.96 --> 1620.94]  Would pierce through
[1620.94 --> 1622.50]  Teach us
[1622.50 --> 1623.80]  Your ways
[1623.80 --> 1625.58]  Show us Jesus
[1625.58 --> 1627.06]  In the gospel
[1627.06 --> 1628.34]  That he came to bring
[1628.34 --> 1630.18]  We pray in Jesus name
[1630.18 --> 1630.86]  Amen
[1630.86 --> 1633.24]  So I want to tell you
[1633.24 --> 1634.52]  About a Christmas day
[1634.52 --> 1635.92]  That happened
[1635.92 --> 1638.08]  In the year 1863
[1638.08 --> 1640.46]  So in that year
[1640.46 --> 1641.32]  On that day
[1641.32 --> 1641.78]  In Christmas
[1641.78 --> 1642.86]  An American poet
[1642.86 --> 1643.80]  Named Henry
[1643.80 --> 1645.94]  Wadsworth Longfellow
[1645.94 --> 1647.52]  Wrote a poem
[1647.52 --> 1649.72]  Called Christmas Bells
[1649.72 --> 1651.76]  Many years later
[1651.76 --> 1653.10]  This poem was turned
[1653.10 --> 1655.04]  Into a Christmas carol
[1655.04 --> 1657.14]  Called I Heard the Bells
[1657.14 --> 1657.88]  On Christmas Day
[1657.88 --> 1660.12]  And one thing
[1660.12 --> 1660.96]  I really appreciate
[1660.96 --> 1661.96]  About this poem
[1661.96 --> 1662.70]  And the song
[1662.70 --> 1664.14]  Is that it is
[1664.14 --> 1665.06]  Honest
[1665.06 --> 1667.40]  About the obvious
[1667.40 --> 1668.82]  Lack of peace
[1668.82 --> 1670.10]  In the world
[1670.10 --> 1671.16]  You know
[1671.16 --> 1671.78]  On Christmas
[1671.78 --> 1673.24]  We can be very
[1673.24 --> 1674.20]  Triumphalistic
[1674.20 --> 1675.84]  But sometimes
[1675.84 --> 1676.84]  We also need to
[1676.84 --> 1677.56]  Acknowledge that
[1677.56 --> 1678.14]  The things that we
[1678.14 --> 1678.88]  Long for
[1678.88 --> 1679.98]  Peace
[1679.98 --> 1680.96]  For instance
[1680.96 --> 1683.40]  Are hard to find
[1683.40 --> 1685.66]  And so the song
[1685.66 --> 1686.92]  Begins like this
[1686.92 --> 1693.48]  It says
[1693.48 --> 1695.04]  I heard the bells
[1695.04 --> 1696.20]  On Christmas Day
[1696.20 --> 1697.70]  Their old familiar
[1697.70 --> 1698.76]  Carols play
[1698.76 --> 1700.56]  And wild and sweet
[1700.56 --> 1701.90]  The words repeat
[1701.90 --> 1704.10]  Of peace on earth
[1704.10 --> 1706.04]  Good will to men
[1706.04 --> 1707.54]  But then listen to
[1707.54 --> 1708.56]  What he says next
[1708.56 --> 1711.94]  This is the honest part
[1711.94 --> 1712.60]  He says
[1712.60 --> 1713.40]  In despair
[1713.40 --> 1714.60]  I bowed my head
[1714.60 --> 1716.22]  There is no peace
[1716.22 --> 1716.72]  On earth
[1716.72 --> 1717.28]  I said
[1717.28 --> 1719.26]  For hate is strong
[1719.26 --> 1720.58]  And mocks the song
[1720.58 --> 1722.58]  Of peace on earth
[1722.58 --> 1723.94]  Good will to men
[1723.94 --> 1725.64]  And so there is
[1725.64 --> 1726.96]  A background behind this
[1726.96 --> 1728.16]  And Longfellow
[1728.16 --> 1728.90]  Wrote this poem
[1728.90 --> 1729.96]  In 1863
[1729.96 --> 1731.20]  Which was
[1731.20 --> 1732.36]  The depths
[1732.36 --> 1733.04]  Of the
[1733.04 --> 1734.36]  Bloody horrendous
[1734.36 --> 1735.42]  American Civil War
[1735.42 --> 1736.80]  This was the year
[1736.80 --> 1737.94]  Of the Battle of Gettysburg
[1737.94 --> 1739.50]  Which was the largest
[1739.50 --> 1740.48]  Battle of the war
[1740.48 --> 1741.94]  Where 50,000
[1741.94 --> 1742.78]  Young men died
[1742.78 --> 1744.98]  And Longfellow's
[1744.98 --> 1745.84]  Oldest son
[1745.84 --> 1746.52]  Charles
[1746.52 --> 1747.64]  Joined the
[1747.64 --> 1748.66]  Union cause
[1748.66 --> 1749.46]  As a soldier
[1749.46 --> 1751.40]  Without his father's
[1751.40 --> 1751.86]  Blessing
[1751.86 --> 1753.56]  Later
[1753.56 --> 1754.84]  He was severely
[1754.84 --> 1755.40]  Wounded
[1755.40 --> 1756.86]  In battle
[1756.86 --> 1757.56]  And of course
[1757.56 --> 1759.04]  This was
[1759.04 --> 1760.04]  A deep blow
[1760.04 --> 1761.88]  To Longfellow
[1761.88 --> 1763.04]  And so
[1763.04 --> 1763.88]  We see this
[1763.88 --> 1764.82]  In his poem
[1764.82 --> 1765.26]  As well
[1765.26 --> 1766.22]  In the next verse
[1766.22 --> 1767.56]  That doesn't appear
[1767.56 --> 1768.76]  In the Christmas carol
[1768.76 --> 1769.74]  But it says this
[1769.74 --> 1771.16]  Then from each
[1771.16 --> 1772.58]  Black accursed mouth
[1772.58 --> 1773.54]  The cannon
[1773.54 --> 1774.80]  Thundered in the south
[1774.80 --> 1776.56]  And with the sound
[1776.56 --> 1777.76]  The carols drowned
[1777.76 --> 1779.84]  Of peace on earth
[1779.84 --> 1781.20]  Goodwill
[1781.20 --> 1782.08]  To men
[1782.08 --> 1784.16]  But you know
[1784.16 --> 1785.06]  This song
[1785.06 --> 1786.52]  I heard the bells
[1786.52 --> 1787.46]  On Christmas Day
[1787.46 --> 1789.20]  It has remained
[1789.20 --> 1789.82]  Popular
[1789.82 --> 1792.26]  Well past the 19th century
[1792.26 --> 1793.28]  Even to today
[1793.28 --> 1794.54]  It has been recorded
[1794.54 --> 1795.92]  By Sarah McLachlan
[1795.92 --> 1797.50]  By Frank Sinatra
[1797.50 --> 1799.62]  By some Christian bands
[1799.62 --> 1801.04]  Including a band
[1801.04 --> 1802.34]  Called Casting Crowns
[1802.34 --> 1806.06]  And I want to
[1806.06 --> 1807.62]  Propose to us
[1807.62 --> 1808.30]  That the reason
[1808.30 --> 1808.82]  This song
[1808.82 --> 1809.54]  Has remained
[1809.54 --> 1810.30]  So popular
[1810.30 --> 1811.92]  Is that we
[1811.92 --> 1812.52]  Still long
[1812.52 --> 1813.10]  For peace
[1813.10 --> 1814.64]  Right
[1814.64 --> 1815.08]  When we look
[1815.08 --> 1815.46]  At the world
[1815.46 --> 1816.12]  Around us
[1816.12 --> 1816.84]  There's still
[1816.84 --> 1817.84]  An obvious
[1817.84 --> 1819.68]  Lack of peace
[1819.68 --> 1821.04]  Right
[1821.04 --> 1821.90]  Wars continue
[1821.90 --> 1822.54]  To rage
[1822.54 --> 1824.04]  All around the world
[1824.04 --> 1826.08]  But not only that
[1826.08 --> 1827.08]  There are the wars
[1827.08 --> 1827.60]  That are raging
[1827.60 --> 1828.82]  In our own hearts
[1828.82 --> 1831.22]  In our relationships
[1831.22 --> 1833.86]  But ultimately
[1833.86 --> 1836.58]  The lack of peace
[1836.58 --> 1837.64]  Comes from
[1837.64 --> 1839.58]  The fundamental reality
[1839.58 --> 1840.88]  That we
[1840.88 --> 1842.00]  Are in rebellion
[1842.00 --> 1843.44]  Against God
[1843.44 --> 1845.90]  But this passage
[1845.90 --> 1847.62]  Of scripture
[1847.62 --> 1848.36]  That Longfellow
[1848.36 --> 1849.04]  Was alluding to
[1849.04 --> 1849.52]  In his poem
[1849.52 --> 1850.64]  Is this message
[1850.64 --> 1851.36]  That we've read
[1851.36 --> 1852.36]  The message
[1852.36 --> 1853.40]  That the angels
[1853.40 --> 1855.12]  Sing to the shepherds
[1855.12 --> 1856.40]  On that first Christmas day
[1856.40 --> 1857.92]  The message is this
[1857.92 --> 1859.42]  That Jesus Christ
[1859.42 --> 1860.60]  Has come
[1860.60 --> 1861.82]  To bring peace
[1861.82 --> 1863.42]  And that one day
[1863.42 --> 1864.02]  This peace
[1864.02 --> 1864.60]  Will fill the
[1864.60 --> 1865.84]  Fill the whole earth
[1865.84 --> 1867.10]  As far
[1867.10 --> 1868.04]  As the curse
[1868.04 --> 1868.62]  Is found
[1868.62 --> 1869.52]  As far as
[1869.52 --> 1870.08]  There are
[1870.08 --> 1871.50]  There is rebellion
[1871.50 --> 1872.58]  Against God
[1872.58 --> 1873.70]  That he will
[1873.70 --> 1874.92]  As the prince of peace
[1874.92 --> 1876.44]  Come and subdue us
[1876.44 --> 1878.54]  With his good rule
[1878.54 --> 1880.66]  And that there will be peace
[1880.66 --> 1881.84]  Friends
[1881.84 --> 1882.92]  That's the good news
[1882.92 --> 1883.98]  That we long for
[1883.98 --> 1884.56]  In Advent
[1884.56 --> 1885.96]  That is the good news
[1885.96 --> 1886.80]  That we celebrate
[1886.80 --> 1887.88]  On Christmas
[1887.88 --> 1889.62]  And so this morning
[1889.62 --> 1890.42]  I'd like us to look at
[1890.42 --> 1891.60]  Two things from this passage
[1891.60 --> 1892.64]  Just about our longing
[1892.64 --> 1893.52]  And our desire
[1893.52 --> 1894.54]  For peace
[1894.54 --> 1895.72]  In all of its many forms
[1895.72 --> 1896.84]  To come into our lives
[1896.84 --> 1898.30]  And that is first
[1898.30 --> 1899.76]  The problem of peace
[1899.76 --> 1901.60]  And then secondly
[1901.60 --> 1903.62]  The provision of peace
[1903.62 --> 1904.32]  So let's look at
[1904.32 --> 1905.10]  Those two things
[1905.10 --> 1906.12]  First
[1906.12 --> 1908.02]  The problem of fear
[1908.02 --> 1908.42]  Excuse me
[1908.42 --> 1909.28]  The problem of fear
[1909.28 --> 1911.72]  And we see this
[1911.72 --> 1913.20]  When the angel of the Lord
[1913.20 --> 1915.08]  Appears to the shepherds
[1915.08 --> 1917.12]  Verse 9 says
[1917.12 --> 1919.58]  An angel of the Lord
[1919.58 --> 1920.92]  Appeared to them
[1920.92 --> 1922.52]  And then note this
[1922.52 --> 1923.92]  The glory of the Lord
[1923.92 --> 1925.08]  Shown around them
[1925.08 --> 1926.30]  And what happened?
[1926.76 --> 1927.62]  They were terrified
[1927.62 --> 1929.48]  Okay, the shepherds
[1929.48 --> 1931.60]  Were filled with fear
[1931.60 --> 1932.94]  They were terrified
[1932.94 --> 1934.60]  But you know
[1934.60 --> 1935.60]  The thing is
[1935.60 --> 1937.34]  It's not just the shepherds
[1937.34 --> 1938.14]  Who are afraid
[1938.14 --> 1940.00]  If we are honest
[1940.00 --> 1941.84]  We also
[1941.84 --> 1943.16]  Are afraid
[1943.16 --> 1945.58]  Why are we afraid?
[1945.76 --> 1946.00]  Well
[1946.00 --> 1948.22]  There's a lot of good reasons
[1948.22 --> 1949.54]  We're afraid
[1949.54 --> 1950.78]  For good reasons
[1950.78 --> 1951.24]  I mean
[1951.24 --> 1952.90]  We live in a world
[1952.90 --> 1954.98]  Of actual real danger
[1954.98 --> 1956.08]  Right?
[1956.20 --> 1957.32]  We suffer
[1957.32 --> 1958.64]  As people
[1958.64 --> 1960.42]  We see people
[1960.42 --> 1961.36]  Around us
[1961.36 --> 1962.14]  Suffer
[1962.14 --> 1963.80]  And we love
[1963.80 --> 1965.24]  Those who are suffering
[1965.24 --> 1967.84]  We're also afraid
[1967.84 --> 1968.76]  Of things like
[1968.76 --> 1969.72]  Rejection
[1969.72 --> 1971.36]  And failure
[1971.36 --> 1972.76]  We're afraid
[1972.76 --> 1973.46]  Of what people
[1973.46 --> 1974.48]  Might think of us
[1974.48 --> 1974.90]  And so
[1974.90 --> 1976.52]  Their opinions
[1976.52 --> 1977.66]  Often control
[1977.66 --> 1978.94]  Our own decisions
[1978.94 --> 1979.84]  And our behavior
[1979.84 --> 1982.34]  We're also afraid
[1982.34 --> 1983.46]  Of the future
[1983.46 --> 1984.52]  And what it might bring
[1984.52 --> 1985.54]  We're afraid
[1985.54 --> 1986.34]  Of bad things
[1986.34 --> 1987.28]  Happening
[1987.28 --> 1988.00]  That are outside
[1988.00 --> 1989.28]  Of our control
[1989.28 --> 1991.78]  Sometimes
[1991.78 --> 1993.36]  Fear
[1993.36 --> 1994.84]  Almost seems
[1994.84 --> 1996.34]  To rule our lives
[1996.34 --> 1997.60]  And it's exhausting
[1997.60 --> 1999.80]  But instead
[1999.80 --> 2000.88]  Of turning
[2000.88 --> 2002.14]  To God
[2002.14 --> 2002.94]  In our fear
[2002.94 --> 2004.72]  Coming to him
[2004.72 --> 2005.50]  In trust
[2005.50 --> 2007.18]  Much of the time
[2007.18 --> 2008.34]  We turn away
[2008.34 --> 2009.04]  From God
[2009.04 --> 2010.12]  In fear
[2010.12 --> 2011.48]  And the reason
[2011.48 --> 2012.52]  Is that ultimately
[2012.52 --> 2013.82]  We're afraid
[2013.82 --> 2014.50]  Of God
[2014.50 --> 2016.26]  You know
[2016.26 --> 2017.24]  Why are the shepherds
[2017.24 --> 2017.72]  Afraid?
[2018.12 --> 2018.64]  Listen again
[2018.64 --> 2019.28]  To verse 9
[2019.28 --> 2019.78]  It says
[2019.78 --> 2020.74]  An angel of the Lord
[2020.74 --> 2021.60]  Appeared to them
[2021.60 --> 2023.80]  The glory of the Lord
[2023.80 --> 2025.56]  Shone around them
[2025.56 --> 2027.10]  And they were terrified
[2027.10 --> 2028.98]  And so the shepherds
[2028.98 --> 2029.50]  Were afraid
[2029.50 --> 2030.52]  And it wasn't because
[2030.52 --> 2031.16]  They're out
[2031.16 --> 2032.72]  In the wilds
[2032.72 --> 2034.58]  Of Bethlehem
[2034.58 --> 2036.42]  It wasn't because
[2036.42 --> 2037.86]  Of predators
[2037.86 --> 2039.00]  That might be
[2039.00 --> 2039.98]  Around
[2039.98 --> 2040.88]  Lions
[2040.88 --> 2042.84]  It wasn't because
[2042.84 --> 2043.84]  Of the hunger
[2043.84 --> 2044.64]  That they likely
[2044.64 --> 2045.34]  Lived with
[2045.34 --> 2047.00]  Or the cold
[2047.00 --> 2049.38]  What they're afraid of
[2049.38 --> 2050.82]  Is when God
[2050.82 --> 2052.22]  Shows up
[2052.22 --> 2053.48]  In his glory
[2053.48 --> 2055.24]  And that's not something
[2055.24 --> 2055.92]  That makes them
[2055.92 --> 2057.00]  Feel
[2057.00 --> 2057.82]  You know
[2057.82 --> 2058.54]  Assured
[2058.54 --> 2059.80]  Rather
[2059.80 --> 2060.40]  It's something
[2060.40 --> 2061.28]  That they are
[2061.28 --> 2062.52]  Deeply afraid of
[2062.52 --> 2063.98]  And friends
[2063.98 --> 2064.62]  This has been
[2064.62 --> 2065.76]  The human condition
[2065.76 --> 2067.52]  Ever since the fall
[2067.52 --> 2068.62]  Right
[2068.62 --> 2069.40]  So think back
[2069.40 --> 2070.42]  When's the first time
[2070.42 --> 2070.88]  In the Bible
[2070.88 --> 2071.72]  We see people
[2071.72 --> 2072.80]  Who are afraid
[2072.80 --> 2074.16]  And it's
[2074.16 --> 2076.08]  When God shows up
[2076.08 --> 2077.98]  In the Garden of Eden
[2077.98 --> 2079.50]  The Bible tells us
[2079.50 --> 2080.32]  That Adam and Eve
[2080.32 --> 2080.84]  Originally
[2080.84 --> 2081.84]  Were put in the garden
[2081.84 --> 2082.60]  They had this
[2082.60 --> 2083.86]  Perfect
[2083.86 --> 2085.18]  Relationship
[2085.18 --> 2085.68]  With God
[2085.68 --> 2086.32]  They were surrounded
[2086.32 --> 2087.12]  By beauty
[2087.12 --> 2087.86]  And plenty
[2087.86 --> 2089.58]  And because
[2089.58 --> 2090.34]  They had
[2090.34 --> 2091.82]  This intimate
[2091.82 --> 2093.64]  Joyful relationship
[2093.64 --> 2094.06]  With God
[2094.06 --> 2095.22]  There was no fear
[2095.22 --> 2096.12]  In their lives
[2096.12 --> 2097.20]  Right
[2097.20 --> 2098.00]  Think about that
[2098.00 --> 2099.54]  If you
[2099.54 --> 2101.12]  Had a perfect
[2101.12 --> 2101.84]  Relationship
[2101.84 --> 2102.34]  With God
[2102.34 --> 2103.24]  There would be
[2103.24 --> 2104.46]  Absolutely no fear
[2104.46 --> 2105.04]  In your life
[2105.04 --> 2108.48]  But when Adam
[2108.48 --> 2109.10]  And Eve
[2109.10 --> 2109.86]  Sinned
[2109.86 --> 2110.80]  Right
[2110.80 --> 2111.48]  When they turned
[2111.48 --> 2112.48]  Away from God
[2112.48 --> 2113.08]  They decided
[2113.08 --> 2114.44]  To be their own
[2114.44 --> 2115.66]  Lords and masters
[2115.66 --> 2117.20]  The first thing
[2117.20 --> 2117.54]  You see
[2117.54 --> 2118.66]  Almost immediately
[2118.66 --> 2119.74]  Because of that
[2119.74 --> 2121.36]  That break in relationship
[2121.36 --> 2122.06]  With God
[2122.06 --> 2123.06]  Is fear
[2123.06 --> 2124.52]  Fear came
[2124.52 --> 2125.86]  They ate
[2125.86 --> 2126.80]  They ate the forbidden fruit
[2126.80 --> 2128.10]  And then they found
[2128.10 --> 2128.72]  Themselves
[2128.72 --> 2129.54]  Naked
[2129.54 --> 2131.32]  And ashamed
[2131.32 --> 2133.00]  And God
[2133.00 --> 2134.06]  God called out
[2134.06 --> 2134.46]  To them
[2134.46 --> 2136.12]  He came to them
[2136.12 --> 2136.60]  And he said
[2136.60 --> 2138.04]  Where are you
[2138.04 --> 2140.30]  And what did Adam say
[2140.30 --> 2141.54]  He said
[2141.54 --> 2142.50]  I heard you
[2142.50 --> 2143.66]  In the garden
[2143.66 --> 2145.16]  And I
[2145.16 --> 2145.74]  Was
[2145.74 --> 2146.70]  Afraid
[2146.70 --> 2148.20]  Because I was
[2148.20 --> 2148.60]  Naked
[2148.60 --> 2150.02]  And so I hid
[2150.02 --> 2152.94]  In the same way
[2152.94 --> 2153.62]  The shepherds
[2153.62 --> 2154.22]  Are terrified
[2154.22 --> 2155.52]  Because God
[2155.52 --> 2156.28]  Came to them
[2156.28 --> 2157.36]  The glory of the Lord
[2157.36 --> 2158.28]  Shone around them
[2158.28 --> 2159.46]  And so what is
[2159.46 --> 2160.56]  The glory of the Lord
[2160.56 --> 2162.94]  It's the radiance
[2162.94 --> 2165.34]  Of his power
[2165.34 --> 2167.54]  Of his majesty
[2167.54 --> 2168.48]  Of his beauty
[2168.48 --> 2169.40]  Of his justice
[2169.40 --> 2170.56]  And righteousness
[2170.56 --> 2173.00]  And when God's glory
[2173.00 --> 2173.72]  Comes and it
[2173.72 --> 2174.76]  Shines on us
[2174.76 --> 2175.22]  It's like
[2175.22 --> 2176.28]  Flipping on this
[2176.28 --> 2177.00]  Spotlight
[2177.00 --> 2177.72]  And the light
[2177.72 --> 2179.00]  Pierces the darkness
[2179.00 --> 2181.32]  And we are exposed
[2181.32 --> 2182.20]  Suddenly
[2182.20 --> 2183.96]  Everything is revealed
[2183.96 --> 2186.24]  And so to understand
[2186.24 --> 2187.20]  Why the shepherds
[2187.20 --> 2188.90]  Might feel so exposed
[2188.90 --> 2190.04]  By God's glory
[2190.04 --> 2191.04]  We need to know
[2191.04 --> 2191.58]  A couple things
[2191.58 --> 2192.46]  About the shepherds
[2192.46 --> 2194.20]  So first of all
[2194.20 --> 2194.42]  You know
[2194.42 --> 2195.46]  They're out in the fields
[2195.46 --> 2196.64]  Watching their flocks
[2196.64 --> 2197.18]  By night
[2197.18 --> 2199.20]  You know
[2199.20 --> 2200.24]  And when I read that
[2200.24 --> 2200.54]  I think
[2200.54 --> 2201.14]  Well that sounds
[2201.14 --> 2202.38]  Kind of nice
[2202.38 --> 2203.24]  You know
[2203.24 --> 2204.02]  I love camping
[2204.02 --> 2205.28]  And camping
[2205.28 --> 2206.34]  With sheep
[2206.34 --> 2207.74]  Sounds pretty fun
[2207.74 --> 2208.60]  That sounds like
[2208.60 --> 2209.10]  An experience
[2209.10 --> 2209.98]  You might pay for
[2209.98 --> 2210.92]  To go and do
[2210.92 --> 2212.66]  But in reality
[2212.66 --> 2213.44]  The shepherds
[2213.44 --> 2214.36]  Were not on vacation
[2214.36 --> 2215.36]  They were not out there
[2215.36 --> 2216.32]  Having a good time
[2216.32 --> 2217.26]  They were out
[2217.26 --> 2217.98]  In the fields
[2217.98 --> 2218.62]  At night
[2218.62 --> 2219.90]  Not because they
[2219.90 --> 2220.54]  Wanted to
[2220.54 --> 2221.46]  But because they
[2221.46 --> 2222.00]  Had to
[2222.00 --> 2223.86]  And their work
[2223.86 --> 2225.50]  Was very hard
[2225.50 --> 2227.90]  The shepherds
[2227.90 --> 2229.08]  Didn't even own
[2229.08 --> 2229.90]  The sheep
[2229.90 --> 2230.82]  That they had to
[2230.82 --> 2231.22]  Graze
[2231.22 --> 2232.94]  And they didn't
[2232.94 --> 2233.84]  Own the land
[2233.84 --> 2234.52]  That the sheep
[2234.52 --> 2235.44]  Were grazing on
[2235.44 --> 2236.94]  They were very poor
[2236.94 --> 2237.58]  They were kind of
[2237.58 --> 2238.26]  The lowest
[2238.26 --> 2239.88]  Strata of society
[2239.88 --> 2242.02]  And they were also
[2242.02 --> 2243.16]  Looked down upon
[2243.16 --> 2244.08]  In fact
[2244.08 --> 2244.62]  Shepherds
[2244.62 --> 2245.10]  Were often
[2245.10 --> 2245.94]  Prevented from
[2245.94 --> 2246.98]  From serving
[2246.98 --> 2247.40]  In
[2247.40 --> 2248.88]  As witnesses
[2248.88 --> 2249.52]  In court
[2249.52 --> 2250.76]  Because of their
[2250.76 --> 2251.50]  Reputations
[2251.50 --> 2252.74]  As thieves
[2252.74 --> 2253.52]  And scoundrels
[2253.52 --> 2255.46]  They were even
[2255.46 --> 2256.46]  Considered by many
[2256.46 --> 2257.42]  To be religiously
[2257.42 --> 2257.88]  Unclean
[2257.88 --> 2258.66]  They weren't allowed
[2258.66 --> 2259.56]  To go into the temple
[2259.56 --> 2261.56]  So they were
[2261.56 --> 2263.06]  Cut off from society
[2263.06 --> 2263.84]  They were cut off
[2263.84 --> 2264.46]  From God
[2264.46 --> 2266.42]  And in that time
[2266.42 --> 2267.44]  And in that society
[2267.44 --> 2268.86]  They were the people
[2268.86 --> 2270.68]  Who would likely
[2270.68 --> 2271.78]  Thought of
[2271.78 --> 2272.58]  As being the
[2272.58 --> 2274.28]  Furthest away from God
[2274.28 --> 2276.46]  And that's what
[2276.46 --> 2277.40]  Makes this so amazing
[2277.40 --> 2279.14]  Because one of the
[2279.14 --> 2279.78]  Amazing things
[2279.78 --> 2280.50]  About this story
[2280.50 --> 2280.92]  Is that
[2280.92 --> 2281.58]  Who does God
[2281.58 --> 2282.06]  Go to
[2282.06 --> 2283.24]  To announce
[2283.24 --> 2283.98]  The good news
[2283.98 --> 2286.12]  Of the Messiah's birth
[2286.12 --> 2286.90]  He goes to
[2286.90 --> 2287.66]  The shepherds
[2287.66 --> 2288.66]  Right
[2288.66 --> 2289.28]  The gospel
[2289.28 --> 2290.78]  Comes to
[2290.78 --> 2292.22]  The humble
[2292.22 --> 2293.78]  And the lowly
[2293.78 --> 2295.14]  The looked down
[2295.14 --> 2295.42]  Upon
[2295.42 --> 2296.28]  The religiously
[2296.28 --> 2296.90]  Unclean
[2296.90 --> 2297.66]  It's completely
[2297.66 --> 2298.26]  Stunning
[2298.26 --> 2300.42]  God sends his
[2300.42 --> 2300.82]  Angel
[2300.82 --> 2301.82]  To announce
[2301.82 --> 2302.20]  The birth
[2302.20 --> 2302.70]  Of a savior
[2302.70 --> 2303.06]  Right
[2303.06 --> 2303.80]  Not in
[2303.80 --> 2304.30]  Jerusalem
[2304.30 --> 2305.50]  In the temple
[2305.50 --> 2306.50]  Where we might
[2306.50 --> 2306.94]  Expect
[2306.94 --> 2307.98]  Not
[2307.98 --> 2310.24]  In Rome
[2310.24 --> 2311.20]  To some
[2311.20 --> 2311.90]  Great king
[2311.90 --> 2312.64]  Or ruler
[2312.64 --> 2314.06]  But to a
[2314.06 --> 2314.88]  Bunch of
[2314.88 --> 2316.42]  Ruffian shepherds
[2316.42 --> 2317.80]  Out in a
[2317.80 --> 2318.20]  Field
[2318.20 --> 2321.38]  Daryl Johnson
[2321.38 --> 2322.02]  Is a well
[2322.02 --> 2322.60]  Known pastor
[2322.60 --> 2323.16]  In Vancouver
[2323.16 --> 2324.32]  And he
[2324.32 --> 2324.84]  Tells
[2324.84 --> 2325.86]  A story
[2325.86 --> 2327.08]  About leading
[2327.08 --> 2327.58]  A bible
[2327.58 --> 2327.94]  Study
[2327.94 --> 2328.30]  With a
[2328.30 --> 2328.48]  Bunch
[2328.48 --> 2328.62]  Of
[2328.62 --> 2329.32]  Prisoners
[2329.32 --> 2329.58]  One
[2329.58 --> 2329.92]  Christmas
[2329.92 --> 2331.72]  And so
[2331.72 --> 2332.52]  After reading
[2332.52 --> 2334.22]  This passage
[2334.22 --> 2334.98]  About the
[2334.98 --> 2335.46]  Angel's
[2335.46 --> 2335.88]  Announcement
[2335.88 --> 2336.14]  To the
[2336.14 --> 2336.60]  Shepherds
[2336.60 --> 2337.42]  He asked
[2337.42 --> 2337.82]  The 40
[2337.82 --> 2338.16]  Or so
[2338.16 --> 2338.52]  Men
[2338.52 --> 2339.64]  What
[2339.64 --> 2340.12]  Strikes
[2340.12 --> 2340.28]  You
[2340.28 --> 2340.52]  About
[2340.52 --> 2340.74]  This
[2340.74 --> 2341.30]  Passage
[2341.30 --> 2342.96]  One
[2342.96 --> 2343.64]  Prisoner
[2343.64 --> 2343.98]  In the
[2343.98 --> 2344.58]  Back row
[2344.58 --> 2345.34]  Stood up
[2345.34 --> 2345.90]  And said
[2345.90 --> 2346.56]  With a
[2346.56 --> 2346.92]  Joyful
[2346.92 --> 2347.24]  Smile
[2347.24 --> 2347.58]  On his
[2347.58 --> 2347.94]  Face
[2347.94 --> 2349.28]  The message
[2349.28 --> 2349.96]  Was first
[2349.96 --> 2350.70]  Delivered
[2350.70 --> 2351.52]  To people
[2351.52 --> 2352.50]  Like us
[2352.50 --> 2352.92]  In this
[2352.92 --> 2353.16]  Room
[2353.16 --> 2355.18]  Right
[2355.18 --> 2355.52]  And that's
[2355.52 --> 2355.90]  Surely
[2355.90 --> 2356.56]  What the
[2356.56 --> 2357.54]  Shepherds
[2357.54 --> 2358.60]  Must have
[2358.60 --> 2359.04]  Felt that
[2359.04 --> 2359.34]  Night
[2359.34 --> 2360.68]  We can't
[2360.68 --> 2361.08]  Believe
[2361.08 --> 2361.80]  An angel
[2361.80 --> 2362.26]  Of the
[2362.26 --> 2362.64]  Lord
[2362.64 --> 2363.72]  Is appearing
[2363.72 --> 2364.24]  To us
[2364.24 --> 2364.74]  Of all
[2364.74 --> 2365.26]  People
[2365.26 --> 2366.58]  That God
[2366.58 --> 2367.22]  Has come
[2367.22 --> 2367.86]  To us
[2367.86 --> 2370.04]  But friends
[2370.04 --> 2370.66]  Just like
[2370.66 --> 2371.60]  The shepherds
[2371.60 --> 2372.46]  You know
[2372.46 --> 2373.18]  We also
[2373.18 --> 2373.78]  Have reason
[2373.78 --> 2374.08]  To be
[2374.08 --> 2374.48]  Afraid
[2374.48 --> 2375.56]  Of God's
[2375.56 --> 2375.86]  Glory
[2375.86 --> 2377.24]  You know
[2377.24 --> 2377.82]  If we
[2377.82 --> 2378.48]  Are honest
[2378.48 --> 2379.54]  We too
[2379.54 --> 2380.46]  Are unclean
[2380.46 --> 2382.22]  Right
[2382.22 --> 2382.78]  We do not
[2382.78 --> 2383.36]  Have
[2383.36 --> 2384.30]  The righteousness
[2384.30 --> 2385.18]  In ourselves
[2385.18 --> 2385.98]  To stand
[2385.98 --> 2387.14]  Before God's
[2387.14 --> 2387.62]  Glorious
[2387.62 --> 2388.30]  Presence
[2388.30 --> 2389.12]  Without
[2389.12 --> 2389.74]  Fear
[2389.74 --> 2392.82]  But just
[2392.82 --> 2393.42]  As God
[2393.42 --> 2394.96]  Came to
[2394.96 --> 2395.44]  Adam and
[2395.44 --> 2395.88]  Eve in the
[2395.88 --> 2396.34]  Garden of
[2396.34 --> 2396.60]  Eden
[2396.60 --> 2397.58]  In their
[2397.58 --> 2398.04]  Hiding
[2398.04 --> 2399.18]  And just
[2399.18 --> 2399.58]  As God
[2399.58 --> 2400.02]  Came to
[2400.02 --> 2400.62]  The shepherds
[2400.62 --> 2400.86]  In the
[2400.86 --> 2401.26]  Field
[2401.26 --> 2402.10]  So God
[2402.10 --> 2402.56]  Comes to
[2402.56 --> 2402.86]  Us
[2402.86 --> 2403.48]  In his
[2403.48 --> 2403.94]  Grace
[2403.94 --> 2404.68]  And he
[2404.68 --> 2405.24]  Invites
[2405.24 --> 2405.56]  Us
[2405.56 --> 2406.02]  Back
[2406.02 --> 2406.46]  Into a
[2406.46 --> 2407.06]  Relationship
[2407.06 --> 2407.50]  With him
[2407.50 --> 2409.72]  So in
[2409.72 --> 2410.16]  The book
[2410.16 --> 2411.16]  The silver
[2411.16 --> 2411.62]  Chair
[2411.62 --> 2412.18]  In the
[2412.18 --> 2412.46]  Narnia
[2412.46 --> 2412.88]  Series
[2412.88 --> 2413.42]  By C.S.
[2413.48 --> 2413.64]  Lewis
[2413.64 --> 2414.52]  There's a
[2414.52 --> 2414.94]  Passage
[2414.94 --> 2415.16]  That I
[2415.16 --> 2415.42]  Think is
[2415.42 --> 2415.74]  Such a
[2415.74 --> 2416.02]  Beautiful
[2416.02 --> 2416.52]  Picture
[2416.52 --> 2418.40]  Of our
[2418.40 --> 2419.16]  Fear
[2419.16 --> 2420.38]  Being
[2420.38 --> 2421.30]  Confronted
[2421.30 --> 2422.36]  By the
[2422.36 --> 2422.94]  Glory of
[2422.94 --> 2423.24]  God
[2423.24 --> 2424.48]  So in
[2424.48 --> 2424.90]  Narnia
[2424.90 --> 2425.68]  As you
[2425.68 --> 2426.46]  Likely know
[2426.46 --> 2426.96]  There's a
[2426.96 --> 2427.30]  Great
[2427.30 --> 2427.80]  Majestic
[2427.80 --> 2428.26]  Lion
[2428.26 --> 2428.82]  Named
[2428.82 --> 2429.32]  Aslan
[2429.32 --> 2430.14]  Who
[2430.14 --> 2430.60]  Represents
[2430.60 --> 2430.98]  God
[2430.98 --> 2431.48]  In the
[2431.48 --> 2431.96]  Stories
[2431.96 --> 2433.62]  And at
[2433.62 --> 2433.78]  One
[2433.78 --> 2434.02]  Point

[2822.96 --> 2823.16]  We
[2823.16 --> 2823.34]  Can
[2823.34 --> 2823.62]  Think
[2823.62 --> 2823.88]  About

[2831.14 --> 2831.36]  It
[2831.36 --> 2831.64]  Means

[2836.54 --> 2836.80]  Eve
[2836.80 --> 2836.98]  We

[2840.66 --> 2841.24]  Presence
[2841.24 --> 2842.44]  But
[2842.44 --> 2842.70]  Through

[2844.06 --> 2844.48]  Loves
[2844.48 --> 2844.84]  Us
[2844.84 --> 2845.66]  We
[2845.66 --> 2845.88]  Can
[2845.88 --> 2846.06]  Be
[2846.06 --> 2847.00]  Reconciled
[2847.00 --> 2847.16]  To
[2847.16 --> 2847.50]  God

[2848.18 --> 2848.54]  Have
[2848.54 --> 2848.80]  His
[2848.80 --> 2849.26]  Favor
[2849.26 --> 2849.62]  Rest
[2849.62 --> 2849.94]  Upon
[2849.94 --> 2850.36]  Us
[2850.36 --> 2852.02]  So
[2852.02 --> 2852.24]  How
[2852.24 --> 2852.34]  Do
[2852.34 --> 2852.44]  We

[2855.22 --> 2855.68]  Again
[2855.68 --> 2856.68]  The
[2856.68 --> 2857.20]  Answer
[2857.20 --> 2858.00]  Is
[2859.46 --> 2859.92]  So
[2859.92 --> 2860.26]  Think
[2860.26 --> 2860.46]  About
[2860.46 --> 2860.62]  The
[2860.62 --> 2860.98]  Shepherds
[2860.98 --> 2861.22]  Again
[2861.22 --> 2861.38]  With
[2861.38 --> 2861.56]  Me
[2861.56 --> 2862.64]  Think
[2862.64 --> 2862.84]  About
[2862.84 --> 2863.12]  Where
[2863.12 --> 2863.34]  They
[2863.34 --> 2863.68]  Are
[2863.68 --> 2864.50]  These
[2864.50 --> 2865.06]  Shepherds
[2865.06 --> 2865.24]  Were
[2865.24 --> 2865.44]  In
[2865.44 --> 2866.10]  Fields
[2866.10 --> 2867.04]  Outside
[2867.04 --> 2867.58]  Of
[2867.58 --> 2868.26]  Bethlehem
[2868.26 --> 2869.66]  Bethlehem
[2869.66 --> 2869.80]  Is
[2869.80 --> 2869.92]  In
[2869.92 --> 2870.04]  The

[2870.34 --> 2870.92]  Surrounding
[2870.92 --> 2871.40]  Jerusalem
[2871.40 --> 2872.12]  And
[2872.12 --> 2872.26]  So
[2872.26 --> 2872.56]  These
[2872.56 --> 2873.20]  Shepherds
[2873.20 --> 2873.74]  Weren't
[2873.74 --> 2873.92]  Just
[2873.92 --> 2874.28]  Raising
[2874.28 --> 2874.72]  Any
[2874.72 --> 2875.20]  Sheep
[2875.20 --> 2876.06]  They
[2876.06 --> 2876.52]  Raised
[2876.52 --> 2876.94]  Sheep
[2876.94 --> 2877.24]  For
[2877.24 --> 2877.44]  The
[2877.44 --> 2877.76]  Temple
[2877.76 --> 2878.02]  In
[2878.02 --> 2878.42]  Jerusalem
[2878.42 --> 2879.40]  Because

[2879.92 --> 2880.20]  Worship
[2880.20 --> 2880.40]  To
[2880.40 --> 2880.80]  Happen
[2880.80 --> 2881.16]  There
[2881.16 --> 2881.34]  Had
[2881.34 --> 2881.44]  To
[2881.44 --> 2881.60]  Be
[2881.60 --> 2882.16]  Animals
[2882.16 --> 2882.88]  Who

[2883.92 --> 2884.04]  In
[2884.04 --> 2884.14]  The
[2884.14 --> 2884.44]  Temple
[2884.44 --> 2885.52]  And
[2885.52 --> 2885.64]  So
[2885.64 --> 2885.92]  These
[2885.92 --> 2886.68]  Shepherds
[2886.68 --> 2887.98]  Commentators
[2887.98 --> 2888.32]  Say
[2888.32 --> 2889.48]  Raised
[2889.48 --> 2890.06]  Sacrificial
[2890.06 --> 2890.60]  Animals
[2890.60 --> 2891.48]  Right
[2891.48 --> 2891.66]  They
[2891.66 --> 2892.08]  Raised
[2892.08 --> 2892.42]  Sheep
[2892.42 --> 2892.62]  Whose

[2895.46 --> 2896.10]  To
[2896.10 --> 2896.40]  Go
[2896.40 --> 2896.90]  Before
[2896.90 --> 2897.24]  God
[2897.24 --> 2897.44]  To
[2897.44 --> 2897.84]  Face
[2897.84 --> 2898.12]  The
[2898.12 --> 2898.54]  Glory
[2898.54 --> 2898.80]  Of
[2898.80 --> 2899.28]  God's
[2899.28 --> 2899.88]  Judgment
[2899.88 --> 2900.54]  And
[2900.54 --> 2901.10]  Die
[2901.10 --> 2902.02]  So
[2902.02 --> 2902.56]  That
[2902.56 --> 2903.72]  God's
[2903.72 --> 2904.58]  Sinful
[2904.58 --> 2905.46]  Fearful
[2905.46 --> 2905.86]  Broken
[2905.86 --> 2906.38]  People
[2906.38 --> 2907.14]  Could
[2907.14 --> 2907.34]  Be
[2907.34 --> 2907.46]  For
[2907.46 --> 2907.48]  For
[2907.48 --> 2908.58]  And
[2908.58 --> 2909.16]  Stand
[2909.16 --> 2910.04]  In
[2910.04 --> 2910.32]  A
[2910.32 --> 2910.56]  Right
[2910.56 --> 2911.26]  Relationship
[2911.26 --> 2911.44]  With
[2911.44 --> 2911.76]  God
[2911.76 --> 2913.48]  That's
[2913.48 --> 2913.66]  The
[2913.66 --> 2914.20]  Animals
[2914.20 --> 2914.42]  That
[2914.42 --> 2914.70]  These
[2914.70 --> 2915.10]  Shepherds
[2915.10 --> 2915.24]  Were
[2915.24 --> 2915.68]  Raising
[2915.68 --> 2916.56]  And
[2916.56 --> 2916.74]  So
[2916.74 --> 2917.00]  If
[2917.00 --> 2917.20]  A
[2917.20 --> 2917.80]  Sacrificial
[2917.80 --> 2918.28]  Lamb
[2918.28 --> 2918.68]  Was
[2918.68 --> 2918.92]  To
[2918.92 --> 2919.16]  Be
[2919.16 --> 2919.52]  Born
[2919.52 --> 2920.76]  These
[2920.76 --> 2921.42]  Shepherds
[2921.42 --> 2921.60]  Would
[2921.60 --> 2921.70]  Be
[2921.70 --> 2921.88]  The
[2921.88 --> 2922.24]  First
[2922.24 --> 2922.44]  To
[2922.44 --> 2922.98]  Recognize
[2922.98 --> 2923.08]  It
[2923.08 --> 2923.22]  They
[2923.22 --> 2923.40]  Were
[2923.40 --> 2924.08]  Experts
[2924.08 --> 2924.26]  On
[2924.26 --> 2924.84]  Sacrificial
[2924.84 --> 2925.42]  Lambs
[2925.42 --> 2927.06]  Perhaps
[2927.06 --> 2927.50]  That's
[2927.50 --> 2927.72]  Why
[2927.72 --> 2927.94]  The
[2927.94 --> 2928.30]  Angels
[2928.30 --> 2928.62]  Told
[2928.62 --> 2928.80]  Them
[2928.80 --> 2929.22]  First
[2929.22 --> 2930.30]  Right
[2930.30 --> 2930.70]  Perhaps
[2930.70 --> 2930.98]  They
[2930.98 --> 2931.22]  Would
[2931.22 --> 2931.78]  Understand

[2932.20 --> 2932.34]  The
[2932.34 --> 2932.64]  Coming
[2932.64 --> 2932.82]  Of
[2932.82 --> 2932.94]  The
[2932.94 --> 2933.34]  Messiah
[2933.34 --> 2933.94]  Means
[2933.94 --> 2935.88]  Because
[2935.88 --> 2936.20]  That
[2936.20 --> 2936.40]  Is
[2936.40 --> 2936.56]  What
[2936.56 --> 2936.94]  Christmas

[3242.84 --> 3244.08]  This
[3244.08 --> 3244.74]  Glory
[3244.74 --> 3245.32]  Will
[3245.32 --> 3245.94]  Shine
[3245.94 --> 3247.80]  Around
[3247.80 --> 3248.02]  The
[3248.02 --> 3248.42]  Entire
[3248.42 --> 3248.88]  World
[3248.88 --> 3249.34]  It
[3249.34 --> 3249.44]  Will
[3249.44 --> 3249.66]  Shine

[3250.36 --> 3250.52]  The
[3250.52 --> 3250.82]  World
[3250.82 --> 3251.46]  But
[3251.46 --> 3251.80]  None
[3251.80 --> 3252.08]  Will
[3252.08 --> 3252.30]  Be
[3252.30 --> 3252.78]  Afraid
[3252.78 --> 3253.50]  Because

[3254.64 --> 3254.86]  In
[3254.86 --> 3255.14]  Jesus
[3255.14 --> 3255.82]  We
[3255.82 --> 3256.32]  Will
[3256.32 --> 3256.68]  Be
[3256.68 --> 3256.98]  Able

[3258.52 --> 3258.72]  Of
[3258.72 --> 3259.00]  God
[3259.00 --> 3259.28]  Because

[3346.50 --> 3348.36]  So
[3348.36 --> 3348.58]  Let's
[3348.58 --> 3348.84]  Now
[3348.84 --> 3349.26]  Sing
[3349.26 --> 3349.50]  Our
[3349.50 --> 3349.76]  Song
[3349.76 --> 3349.90]  Of
[3349.90 --> 3350.32]  Response
[3350.32 --> 3359.28]  Friends
[3359.28 --> 3383.52]  O come, O Pea, David, come, and open wide our heavenly home.
[3383.52 --> 3396.76]  Make safe the way that leads on high, and cause the cross to misery.
[3398.90 --> 3412.20]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3413.52 --> 3428.52]  O come, O brightened morning star, and bring us comfort from afar.
[3428.52 --> 3443.52]  Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, and as dark shadows pull into flight.
[3443.52 --> 3458.52]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3458.52 --> 3476.52]  O come, these are of nations, find the peoples in one heart and mind.
[3476.52 --> 3491.92]  May all our satisfaction cease, and be thy suffering, King of peace.
[3491.92 --> 3497.40]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
[3497.92 --> 3505.92]  In the Father, who else shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3505.92 --> 3508.92]  O Israel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3508.92 --> 3524.80]  In our community prayer this morning, we will remember those who are in mourning.
[3526.80 --> 3532.26]  Our condolences to Tim's wife, Noreen, his daughters, Lisa and Christina,
[3532.26 --> 3538.92]  his grandson Alexander, his father and stepmother Joan and Wilma,
[3539.52 --> 3544.70]  and other immediate family members, and his and Noreen's extended families.
[3545.28 --> 3551.90]  We will also remember Nick and Jane and Lynn in the death of Jane and Lynn's sister Mary,
[3552.54 --> 3556.96]  and Jerry and Joan as they mourn the passing of Jerry's sister Dina,
[3556.96 --> 3563.96]  and the family of Elizabeth Van Dierman, who passed away on November the 27th.
[3565.70 --> 3567.04]  Let us pray.
[3569.28 --> 3576.32]  Eternal God, for whom all people wait and search, even though they don't realize it,
[3576.98 --> 3580.82]  we cry out today for a live and present word from you.
[3581.82 --> 3585.72]  As our season of discontent approaches the day of your coming,
[3585.72 --> 3591.24]  we pray that you would speak to us in the graceful ways that you know best.
[3592.60 --> 3598.28]  Open our eyes that have been closed by fear and blinded by self-pity,
[3598.82 --> 3604.54]  that we may see you even in the anxieties and uncertainties that beset our days
[3604.54 --> 3608.92]  and threaten to overwhelm us like a cloud of darkness.
[3608.92 --> 3617.02]  Help us to see that amid the anxiety of this time of the pandemic and all of its ramifications,
[3617.66 --> 3619.82]  you have become incarnate,
[3620.52 --> 3625.62]  sanctifying the smallest tasks of love, generosity, and kindness
[3625.62 --> 3629.62]  that we are enabled by your grace to perform.
[3629.62 --> 3634.44]  We think of the needs of others at this time, O Lord,
[3635.14 --> 3637.62]  and we are embarrassed by our selfishness.
[3638.58 --> 3642.70]  May the answer to our prayers begin with us to redeem the times,
[3643.40 --> 3647.80]  bring to all those who are in need the alleviation of their poverty
[3647.80 --> 3651.54]  or comfort for their minds and spirits.
[3652.90 --> 3655.78]  Enable us to do what we can do to help them,
[3656.06 --> 3658.16]  to share our own happiness and prosperity,
[3658.58 --> 3661.48]  to provide a listening ear or friendly word,
[3661.86 --> 3664.60]  to do errands or acts of kindness.
[3664.60 --> 3671.42]  But let us not be content so long as conditions exist that foster human distress
[3671.42 --> 3678.06]  from generation to generation through the repetition of ignorance and disease.
[3679.24 --> 3681.98]  We pray that the promise of your birth,
[3682.80 --> 3686.48]  that peace shall be on earth, may soon be fulfilled,
[3687.38 --> 3691.26]  both in our troubled hearts and in our troubled world.
[3691.26 --> 3695.46]  We pray for governments and health authorities
[3695.46 --> 3699.20]  responsible for the distribution of the vaccines for COVID-19.
[3700.14 --> 3704.24]  We pray for health care workers overwhelmed and exhausted.
[3705.14 --> 3707.84]  We pray that all citizens may be compliant
[3707.84 --> 3709.78]  so that the virus may be contained.
[3710.90 --> 3714.16]  We plead for mercy for those governments around the world
[3714.16 --> 3716.32]  who cannot afford these vaccines.
[3716.32 --> 3723.16]  Come to us, Lord, for we need your presence in our own lives.
[3724.14 --> 3728.44]  We pray especially for those dear to us who are sick or troubled
[3728.44 --> 3733.04]  or unsure or near the hour of their death.
[3734.32 --> 3736.36]  We pray for the sick among us,
[3736.96 --> 3739.90]  Joan, Kim, Kathy.
[3740.60 --> 3743.60]  We pray for our elderly and shut-ins,
[3743.60 --> 3745.24]  for those who are lonely.
[3746.32 --> 3748.62]  We pray for those who mourn.
[3748.84 --> 3753.94]  We pray today especially for Noreen, Christine, Lisa, Alexander,
[3754.70 --> 3760.20]  John, Wilma, Ralph, Johnny and Morag, Denny,
[3760.50 --> 3762.94]  and so many others mourning the death of Tim.
[3764.22 --> 3765.54]  May they know your love.
[3766.90 --> 3769.18]  We pray for Steen and her family
[3769.18 --> 3771.20]  as they mourn the death of Pastor Henry.
[3772.20 --> 3773.98]  May they know your presence.
[3773.98 --> 3779.58]  Comfort Nick and Jane, Lynn, Jerry and Joan,
[3780.86 --> 3782.50]  John and Margaret Van Dierman
[3782.50 --> 3785.64]  as they mourn the loss of loved ones.
[3787.42 --> 3789.56]  Comfort, comfort your people
[3789.56 --> 3792.66]  and fill each heart with your peace.
[3793.84 --> 3796.34]  We pray for the world into which you came
[3796.34 --> 3797.84]  and which you still love.
[3797.84 --> 3800.22]  touch us anew with the hope
[3800.22 --> 3802.46]  that is the heritage of those who love you
[3802.46 --> 3803.84]  and trust your promises.
[3805.72 --> 3807.14]  In Jesus Christ,
[3807.58 --> 3810.34]  who is the joy of those who are happy
[3810.34 --> 3812.46]  and the comfort of those who mourn,
[3812.46 --> 3814.52]  who is our peace.
[3817.40 --> 3819.10]  We pray all this.
[3820.14 --> 3821.20]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[3821.20 --> 3822.76]  Amen.
[3822.76 --> 3822.84]  Amen.
[3839.84 --> 3841.12]  Brothers and sisters,
[3841.52 --> 3843.12]  receive these words of blessing
[3843.12 --> 3845.28]  and benediction from your Heavenly Father.
[3845.28 --> 3846.28]  Amen.
[3846.28 --> 3847.28]  Amen.
[3847.28 --> 3848.64]  May the God of peace,
[3849.56 --> 3851.34]  who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[3851.34 --> 3853.22]  brought back from the dead,
[3853.34 --> 3854.44]  the Lord Jesus Christ,
[3854.54 --> 3855.86]  that great shepherd of the sheep,
[3856.70 --> 3858.64]  equip you with everything good
[3858.64 --> 3859.78]  for doing his will.
[3860.46 --> 3861.76]  And may he work in us
[3861.76 --> 3863.64]  that which is pleasing to him.
[3864.20 --> 3865.22]  Through Jesus Christ,
[3865.32 --> 3867.34]  to whom be glory forever and ever.
[3868.16 --> 3868.52]  Amen.
[3868.52 --> 3868.60]  Amen.
[3868.60 --> 3868.64]  Amen.
