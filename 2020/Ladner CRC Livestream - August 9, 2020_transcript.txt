[5.40 --> 6.84]  Here's what he s at fault
[6.84 --> 26.70]  N
[26.70 --> 29.76]  D
[29.76 --> 31.76]  Oh
[59.76 --> 61.76]  Oh
[89.76 --> 91.76]  Oh
[91.76 --> 93.76]  Oh
[93.76 --> 95.76]  Oh

[101.76 --> 103.76]  Oh
[103.76 --> 105.76]  Oh
[109.76 --> 119.76]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church. We are so grateful you decided to tune in to our service today. My name is Ashley and with me today is Mary
[119.76 --> 129.76]  Ann and my mom Melanie on the piano. I don't know about you, but there are Sundays when I find it difficult to focus on our services when I'm sitting at home cozy in my living room.
[129.76 --> 137.76]  It seems to be the time that I notice the dust collecting on my mantle or the pile of books that should be put away or the house plants I haven't watered all week.
[137.76 --> 146.76]  All things that haven't bothered me up until Sunday. But once I've sat down and the services started, that's when I feel the need to do all these things.
[146.76 --> 152.76]  In light of these distractions, I thought it might be a good idea to pray and ask for the Spirit's help to stay focused this morning.
[152.76 --> 154.76]  Let's pray.
[154.76 --> 161.76]  Dear Lord, thank you for technology that allows us to still come together to worship you and hear from you each Sunday.
[161.76 --> 171.76]  I pray for your Spirit's help to quiet our hearts and minds to the distractions of our world and our to-do lists so that we will be able to enjoy being in your presence and hearing from you.
[171.76 --> 173.76]  In Jesus name, Amen.
[173.76 --> 174.76]  Amen.
[174.76 --> 178.76]  Listen to this invitation to worship this morning from Psalm 9.
[178.76 --> 181.76]  We will give thanks to you, O Lord, with our whole heart.
[181.76 --> 184.76]  We will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
[184.76 --> 186.76]  We will be glad and exalt you.
[186.76 --> 189.76]  We will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
[189.76 --> 192.76]  Please join us as we sing the following songs.
[192.76 --> 213.76]  We will sing the following songs, O God, O Lord, with our Lord Jesus' name, and angels must sing on.
[213.76 --> 238.76]  We will sing the following songs, O Lord, with our Lord, with our Lord, with our Lord.
[238.76 --> 243.76]  We will say to you, O Lord, with our Lord.
[243.76 --> 248.76]  We will sing the following songs, O Lord, with our Lord.
[248.76 --> 258.76]  We will sing the following songs, O Lord, with our Lord.
[258.76 --> 271.00]  For him who saves you by his days and will give no word of all.
[271.00 --> 292.80]  And every tongue and every tribe on this terrestrial pole, to him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.
[292.80 --> 304.80]  To your heart, majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.
[306.26 --> 315.12]  Go down and call the secret cross, the endless feet in full.
[315.12 --> 327.12]  We'll join thee, O Lord of all, and crown him Lord of all.
[327.90 --> 340.32]  We'll join thee, O Lord of all, and crown him Lord of all.
[340.32 --> 369.14]  S ahorself
[369.14 --> 372.68]  All for Jesus
[372.68 --> 378.48]  All I am and proud
[378.48 --> 383.28]  And never meant to be
[383.28 --> 387.98]  All of my
[387.98 --> 393.14]  In the shadows, robes and masks
[393.14 --> 397.52]  I surrender these
[397.52 --> 401.06]  Into your hands
[401.06 --> 407.06]  For it's only in
[407.06 --> 411.26]  Your will that I am free
[411.26 --> 417.06]  For it's only in
[417.06 --> 422.18]  Your will that I am free
[422.18 --> 425.72]  Jesus
[425.72 --> 430.72]  All for Jesus
[430.72 --> 435.92]  All I am and proud
[435.92 --> 439.72]  And never meant to be
[439.72 --> 445.26]  Jesus
[445.26 --> 450.26]  All for Jesus
[450.26 --> 455.26]  All I am and proud
[455.26 --> 459.26]  And never meant to be
[459.26 --> 465.62]  All of my
[465.62 --> 466.80]  Ambition
[466.80 --> 469.80]  Swap to pass
[469.80 --> 475.00]  I surrender these
[475.00 --> 478.54]  Into your hands
[478.54 --> 484.08]  For it's only in
[484.08 --> 488.08]  Your will that I am free
[488.08 --> 490.62]  I am and never meant to be
[490.62 --> 493.62]  All for it's only in
[493.62 --> 497.62]  Your will that I am free
[497.62 --> 501.16]  I am and never meant to be
[501.16 --> 503.16]  I am free
[503.16 --> 505.16]  I am free
[505.16 --> 507.16]  Jesus
[507.16 --> 509.16]  No part in desires
[509.16 --> 510.70]  All for it's only in
[510.70 --> 516.70]  I am and never meant to be
[516.70 --> 518.70]  I am and never meant to be
[518.70 --> 532.24]  I am and never meant to be
[532.24 --> 534.24]  We won't fear the battle
[534.24 --> 536.24]  We won't fear the night
[536.24 --> 538.78]  We will walk the valley
[538.78 --> 539.78]  We will walk the valley
[539.78 --> 540.78]  With you by your side
[540.78 --> 542.78]  You will go before us
[542.78 --> 545.78]  You will lead the way
[545.78 --> 548.78]  We have found a refuge
[548.78 --> 550.78]  It's only you can stay
[550.78 --> 554.78]  Sing with joy now
[554.78 --> 556.90]  Our God is glorious
[556.90 --> 557.78]  Our God is glorious
[557.78 --> 559.28]  When God is come
[559.28 --> 561.78]  Is a strong and mighty fortress
[561.78 --> 564.78]  Raise Your voice now
[564.78 --> 572.72]  Your love is greater, you can stand against us, if our God is for us.
[572.72 --> 591.56]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall, even when I turn, still your love is short.
[591.56 --> 602.24]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake, you will cheer me on with a never-ending grace.
[602.72 --> 608.00]  Sing and join now, our God is for us.
[608.38 --> 612.36]  Your Father's love is a strong and mighty function.
[612.94 --> 622.74]  Raise your voice now, your love is greater, you can stand against us, if our God is for us.
[622.74 --> 641.72]  Do not hide nor death, in simple ways, as hell and death will not defeat us.
[641.72 --> 650.60]  He who gave His Son to free us holds me in His love.
[650.60 --> 660.96]  Neither hide nor death, in simple ways, as hell and death will not defeat us.
[660.96 --> 669.80]  He who gave His Son to free us holds me in His love.
[670.80 --> 671.36]  Sing.
[672.96 --> 678.24]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[678.24 --> 685.24]  Raise your voice now, our God is for us.
[685.24 --> 686.24]  Sing.
[686.24 --> 692.24]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[692.24 --> 695.24]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[695.24 --> 699.24]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[699.24 --> 701.24]  If all His love is a strong and mighty function.
[701.24 --> 704.24]  Raise your voice now, your love is great.
[704.24 --> 712.48]  No loud is great, who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[712.48 --> 742.46]  No loud is great, who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[742.48 --> 747.74]  He reminds us of our sinful imperfection and draws us to him to confess and be renewed.
[748.74 --> 751.00]  Please bow your heads while I pray this prayer.
[752.14 --> 757.40]  Lord God, we have given more weight to our successes and our happiness than to your will.
[758.42 --> 760.68]  We have eaten without thought for the hungry.
[761.28 --> 763.84]  We have spoken without an effort to understand others.
[764.36 --> 766.96]  We have kept silent instead of telling the truth.
[767.16 --> 771.44]  We have judged others, forgetful that you alone are judge.
[772.48 --> 777.12]  We have acted rather in accordance with our opinions than according to your commands.
[777.78 --> 781.28]  Within your church, we have been slow to practice love to our neighbors.
[781.82 --> 784.56]  And in the world, we have not been your faithful servants.
[785.40 --> 790.44]  Forgive us and help us to live as disciples of Jesus Christ, your Son and our Savior.
[790.88 --> 791.16]  Amen.
[791.16 --> 796.64]  Let's sing, there is a Redeemer, as our assurance of what Jesus has done for us.
[796.64 --> 815.06]  There is a Redeemer, Jesus, God's own Son.
[815.06 --> 824.36]  Precious heaven, Lord, Messiah, O Holy One.
[825.44 --> 835.18]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[835.18 --> 849.96]  Thank you, O Lord, for giving us your Son.
[849.96 --> 857.02]  We were near upon all names.
[857.52 --> 866.32]  Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, hope for sinners slain.
[867.40 --> 876.68]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your sin.
[876.68 --> 887.74]  We'll leave on your spirit till the word on earth is done.
[889.66 --> 899.62]  When I stand in glory, I will see His face.
[899.62 --> 909.58]  There I'll stir my King forever in that holy place.
[911.04 --> 920.52]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[920.52 --> 931.08]  And we'll leave on your spirit till the word on earth is done.
[931.08 --> 931.48]  Amen.
[941.28 --> 942.60]  Well, good morning, friends.
[942.88 --> 951.36]  It's great to worship together, even though still after so many months, it's hard.
[951.54 --> 952.90]  You know, it's hard not being together.
[953.02 --> 954.56]  And I know we all long to be together.
[954.56 --> 959.86]  And so we continue to put our hope in Christ that He will keep us together in Him.
[960.84 --> 966.30]  And I am really, though, enjoying our study in the book of Acts.
[966.80 --> 973.44]  And I think it's such a fruitful book to help us consider how we are to live together as the church in the world,
[973.66 --> 978.98]  empowered by the Holy Spirit, the very Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[978.98 --> 987.02]  And last week in Acts chapter 3, we saw two of Jesus' disciples, Peter and John.
[987.62 --> 993.12]  And they performed their first miracle without Jesus' physical presence.
[993.98 --> 997.58]  And they healed a man who hadn't been able to walk his whole life.
[998.42 --> 1006.58]  And then following that miracle, Peter preaches a sermon explaining that this man wasn't healed by his own power,
[1006.58 --> 1010.58]  but through the resurrection power of Jesus.
[1011.76 --> 1020.74]  And we talked about how, as a church, we want to be faithful to God's call to proclaim or tell the story of Jesus
[1020.74 --> 1027.36]  and also to serve our neighbors by attending not only to their spiritual needs,
[1027.44 --> 1034.30]  but also to their physical, emotional, intellectual, vocational needs.
[1034.30 --> 1040.80]  And so now today, we pick up the narrative in chapter 4.
[1041.54 --> 1047.02]  So Peter and John are immediately confronted by the Jewish religious leaders
[1047.02 --> 1053.26]  because Peter and John are on their turf, preaching Jesus as the Messiah.
[1054.16 --> 1057.66]  And then, so they find themselves arrested and put in jail.
[1058.12 --> 1061.18]  And so let's read now together what happens.
[1061.18 --> 1063.72]  So we're in Acts chapter 4.
[1063.88 --> 1066.24]  We'll be reading verses 1 through 22.
[1067.50 --> 1071.68]  So please give your attention while I read this for us.
[1073.68 --> 1079.70]  The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John
[1079.70 --> 1081.26]  while they were speaking to the people.
[1081.68 --> 1085.42]  They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people,
[1086.12 --> 1089.34]  proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
[1089.34 --> 1095.32]  They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.
[1096.32 --> 1102.38]  But many who heard the message believed, and so the number of men who believed grew to about 5,000.
[1103.60 --> 1109.82]  The next day, the rulers, the elders, and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
[1109.82 --> 1112.30]  Annas, the high priest, was there.
[1112.54 --> 1119.16]  So was Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others of the high priest's family.
[1120.30 --> 1123.94]  They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them.
[1124.08 --> 1126.96]  By what power or what name did you do this?
[1126.96 --> 1130.74]  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them,
[1130.94 --> 1133.16]  Rulers and elders of the people,
[1133.50 --> 1137.02]  if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness,
[1137.44 --> 1138.94]  shown to a man who is lame,
[1139.46 --> 1141.38]  and are being asked how he was healed,
[1142.38 --> 1143.28]  then know this,
[1143.74 --> 1145.12]  you and all the people of Israel,
[1145.48 --> 1148.06]  it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[1148.42 --> 1148.96]  whom you crucified,
[1150.00 --> 1151.72]  but whom God raised from the dead,
[1152.04 --> 1154.08]  that this man stands before you healed.
[1154.08 --> 1158.26]  Jesus is the stone you builders rejected,
[1158.76 --> 1160.80]  which has become the cornerstone.
[1161.58 --> 1163.62]  Salvation is found in no one else,
[1163.92 --> 1166.26]  for there is no other name under heaven
[1166.26 --> 1169.36]  given to mankind by which we must be saved.
[1170.82 --> 1173.44]  When they saw the courage of Peter and John
[1173.44 --> 1177.54]  and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men,
[1177.96 --> 1179.04]  they were astonished,
[1179.48 --> 1181.96]  and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
[1181.96 --> 1185.46]  But since they couldn't see the man who had been healed
[1185.46 --> 1186.66]  standing there with them,
[1187.26 --> 1188.46]  there was nothing they could say.
[1189.70 --> 1192.64]  So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin,
[1193.00 --> 1194.78]  and then conferred together.
[1195.40 --> 1196.82]  What are we going to do with these men?
[1197.22 --> 1197.80]  They asked.
[1198.44 --> 1200.58]  Everyone living in Jerusalem knows
[1200.58 --> 1202.68]  they have performed a notable sign,
[1203.20 --> 1204.46]  and we cannot deny it.
[1205.00 --> 1207.84]  But to stop this thing from spreading any further
[1207.84 --> 1208.56]  among the people,
[1208.86 --> 1211.46]  we must warn them to speak no longer
[1211.46 --> 1213.60]  to anyone in this name.
[1214.50 --> 1216.50]  Then they called them in again
[1216.50 --> 1219.16]  and commanded them not to speak or teach at all
[1219.16 --> 1220.06]  in the name of Jesus.
[1220.80 --> 1222.20]  But Peter and John replied,
[1222.84 --> 1224.32]  which is right in God's eyes,
[1224.48 --> 1226.42]  to listen to you or to him?
[1226.98 --> 1227.82]  You be the judges.
[1228.50 --> 1229.24]  As for us,
[1229.48 --> 1230.80]  we cannot help speaking
[1230.80 --> 1233.18]  about what we have seen and heard.
[1234.72 --> 1236.02]  After further threats,
[1236.02 --> 1237.14]  they let them go.
[1237.60 --> 1239.78]  They could not decide how to punish them
[1239.78 --> 1241.66]  because all the people were praising God
[1241.66 --> 1243.00]  for what had happened.
[1244.22 --> 1244.88]  So friends,
[1244.96 --> 1246.26]  this is the word of the Lord.
[1247.52 --> 1248.66]  Thanks be to God.
[1249.56 --> 1251.32]  So let's pray together as we begin.
[1253.34 --> 1253.78]  Father,
[1253.88 --> 1257.84]  we thank you for this episode,
[1258.22 --> 1259.70]  this picture we have
[1259.70 --> 1261.72]  of your church
[1261.72 --> 1263.96]  kind of put on trial
[1263.96 --> 1264.82]  before the world
[1264.82 --> 1267.66]  for following Jesus.
[1268.42 --> 1269.02]  And Lord,
[1269.10 --> 1270.42]  we face the same thing today.
[1271.14 --> 1272.00]  We face it
[1272.00 --> 1273.40]  in different ways.
[1274.26 --> 1274.76]  And so Lord,
[1274.80 --> 1276.02]  we also need to learn
[1276.02 --> 1277.82]  what it looks like
[1277.82 --> 1278.94]  to courageously
[1278.94 --> 1280.26]  and boldly proclaim
[1280.26 --> 1281.12]  Jesus
[1281.12 --> 1282.36]  to a world.
[1283.32 --> 1283.62]  Lord,
[1283.70 --> 1284.88]  we need your spirit,
[1285.02 --> 1285.80]  we need your grace,
[1286.22 --> 1287.12]  and we need your love.
[1287.78 --> 1288.18]  And so Lord,
[1288.26 --> 1289.02]  teach us this morning
[1289.02 --> 1290.00]  as we open your word,
[1290.00 --> 1290.96]  by your Holy Spirit,
[1291.12 --> 1291.82]  illumine us.
[1292.50 --> 1292.78]  And Lord,
[1292.90 --> 1294.28]  may we learn your ways.
[1294.42 --> 1295.48]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1295.98 --> 1296.28]  Amen.
[1297.64 --> 1298.50]  So some of you
[1298.50 --> 1299.40]  may be familiar
[1299.40 --> 1300.80]  with the Netflix series
[1300.80 --> 1301.88]  called The Crown.
[1302.68 --> 1302.98]  Anybody?
[1303.40 --> 1303.70]  Yes?
[1303.82 --> 1304.00]  Okay,
[1304.06 --> 1304.40]  some of you?
[1305.02 --> 1306.90]  The Crown is loosely based
[1306.90 --> 1308.68]  on Queen Elizabeth II's
[1308.68 --> 1309.40]  early reign.
[1310.48 --> 1312.40]  And even if you don't
[1312.40 --> 1313.90]  have a particular love
[1313.90 --> 1314.86]  for, you know,
[1314.98 --> 1316.16]  British period dramas,
[1316.66 --> 1317.66]  that's okay.
[1317.66 --> 1317.70]  Okay.
[1318.70 --> 1319.18]  But,
[1320.08 --> 1321.68]  there is
[1321.68 --> 1323.20]  at least one episode
[1323.20 --> 1325.02]  that is worth watching.
[1325.34 --> 1326.50]  It's very good.
[1326.98 --> 1327.18]  It's,
[1327.38 --> 1328.26]  if you want to take notes
[1328.26 --> 1328.90]  and watch it later,
[1329.04 --> 1329.58]  season one,
[1329.66 --> 1330.28]  episode nine.
[1331.36 --> 1332.52]  So what happens is,
[1332.78 --> 1334.52]  Prime Minister Winston Churchill
[1334.52 --> 1335.80]  is turning 80.
[1336.66 --> 1337.46]  And to celebrate
[1337.46 --> 1338.28]  his many years
[1338.28 --> 1339.20]  of public service,
[1339.50 --> 1340.64]  Parliament has commissioned
[1340.64 --> 1341.40]  an artist
[1341.40 --> 1342.98]  named Graham Sutherland
[1342.98 --> 1344.20]  to paint a portrait
[1344.20 --> 1344.86]  of Churchill,
[1344.86 --> 1346.82]  who himself,
[1346.96 --> 1347.24]  Churchill,
[1347.48 --> 1349.00]  was a prolific artist.
[1350.06 --> 1350.48]  And so,
[1350.64 --> 1351.64]  I have a little photo
[1351.64 --> 1352.14]  for you.
[1353.00 --> 1354.78]  And there is Sutherland,
[1354.92 --> 1355.56]  the painter,
[1355.82 --> 1356.86]  and Winston Churchill
[1356.86 --> 1358.30]  sitting in the chair
[1358.30 --> 1359.26]  and being painted.
[1361.46 --> 1362.22]  And so,
[1362.34 --> 1362.98]  in the show,
[1363.22 --> 1363.98]  the two of them
[1363.98 --> 1365.72]  meet several times
[1365.72 --> 1366.76]  in different sittings
[1366.76 --> 1368.06]  so that the portrait
[1368.06 --> 1368.78]  can be completed.
[1369.66 --> 1370.80]  And at the first sitting,
[1370.96 --> 1372.00]  Churchill immediately
[1372.00 --> 1372.86]  asked Sutherland
[1372.86 --> 1373.94]  in his,
[1374.00 --> 1374.28]  no,
[1374.36 --> 1374.88]  distinctive,
[1375.60 --> 1376.90]  curmudgeonly voice.
[1378.02 --> 1378.40]  He says,
[1378.48 --> 1378.72]  so,
[1379.34 --> 1380.58]  will we be engaged
[1380.58 --> 1381.52]  in flattery
[1381.52 --> 1382.64]  or reality?
[1383.30 --> 1384.50]  Are you going to paint me
[1384.50 --> 1385.36]  as a cherub
[1385.36 --> 1386.92]  or a bulldog?
[1388.20 --> 1389.58]  And these questions
[1389.58 --> 1390.98]  spark a fascinating
[1390.98 --> 1391.96]  conversation
[1391.96 --> 1392.72]  that continues
[1392.72 --> 1393.86]  over the course
[1393.86 --> 1394.56]  of their sittings
[1394.56 --> 1395.34]  about the nature
[1395.34 --> 1396.10]  of truth
[1396.10 --> 1397.22]  and the role
[1397.22 --> 1397.92]  of an artist
[1397.92 --> 1399.18]  in portraying truth.
[1400.04 --> 1400.40]  And Churchill
[1400.40 --> 1401.34]  goes on to say,
[1401.34 --> 1403.40]  I never let accuracy
[1403.40 --> 1404.20]  get in the way
[1404.20 --> 1404.72]  of truth.
[1405.54 --> 1406.78]  But for Sutherland,
[1407.46 --> 1407.88]  accuracy
[1407.88 --> 1409.44]  is truth.
[1410.62 --> 1411.38]  And, you know,
[1411.42 --> 1411.90]  that's kind of
[1411.90 --> 1413.12]  a fascinating debate.
[1413.38 --> 1413.48]  You know,
[1413.52 --> 1414.50]  we could kind of
[1414.50 --> 1415.90]  weigh those perspectives
[1415.90 --> 1416.68]  and there's probably
[1416.68 --> 1417.22]  some truth
[1417.22 --> 1417.84]  in both of them.
[1418.62 --> 1419.54]  But what stood out
[1419.54 --> 1420.06]  to me
[1420.06 --> 1420.66]  as it relates
[1420.66 --> 1421.86]  to our passage today
[1421.86 --> 1424.02]  was Sutherland's courage
[1424.02 --> 1425.06]  to paint
[1425.06 --> 1426.30]  a true portrait.
[1427.26 --> 1427.48]  Right?
[1427.52 --> 1428.06]  His willingness
[1428.06 --> 1428.84]  to proclaim
[1428.84 --> 1429.70]  what is true
[1429.70 --> 1430.64]  through his painting
[1430.64 --> 1431.80]  and his art
[1431.80 --> 1434.02]  even at the risk
[1434.02 --> 1435.30]  of provoking
[1435.30 --> 1436.02]  to anger
[1436.02 --> 1437.68]  the most powerful
[1437.68 --> 1438.64]  man in England.
[1440.06 --> 1441.22]  And friends,
[1441.38 --> 1442.28]  this has always
[1442.28 --> 1443.16]  been the calling
[1443.16 --> 1443.94]  of the church
[1443.94 --> 1445.88]  to speak truth
[1445.88 --> 1447.26]  even when
[1447.26 --> 1448.08]  it's costly
[1448.08 --> 1449.14]  and when there
[1449.14 --> 1449.86]  is pressure
[1449.86 --> 1450.96]  not to speak
[1450.96 --> 1451.58]  about Jesus.
[1452.84 --> 1453.54]  And so the question
[1453.54 --> 1454.26]  for us is
[1454.26 --> 1455.36]  how do we
[1455.36 --> 1456.60]  do that well?
[1457.30 --> 1458.28]  How do we today
[1458.28 --> 1459.12]  as the church
[1459.12 --> 1459.90]  do this?
[1460.34 --> 1461.08]  How do we speak
[1461.08 --> 1461.48]  in a way
[1461.48 --> 1462.28]  that reflects
[1462.28 --> 1463.56]  the truth
[1463.56 --> 1464.58]  and the love
[1464.58 --> 1465.08]  of Jesus?
[1466.14 --> 1466.98]  And how do we
[1466.98 --> 1467.36]  do this
[1467.36 --> 1468.60]  in our culture
[1468.60 --> 1469.92]  that rarely
[1469.92 --> 1470.94]  seems to want
[1470.94 --> 1471.56]  to hear
[1471.56 --> 1472.98]  our interpretation
[1472.98 --> 1473.82]  of reality?
[1475.20 --> 1475.98]  And so this morning
[1475.98 --> 1476.52]  I'd like us
[1476.52 --> 1477.62]  to look at two things
[1477.62 --> 1478.20]  together
[1478.20 --> 1479.48]  in this passage.
[1480.16 --> 1481.10]  And it's kind of
[1481.10 --> 1481.86]  just two questions
[1481.86 --> 1482.78]  looking at
[1482.78 --> 1483.48]  this narrative.
[1483.64 --> 1484.36]  And the first one
[1484.36 --> 1486.26]  is why
[1486.26 --> 1486.86]  were their
[1486.86 --> 1487.76]  feathers ruffled
[1487.76 --> 1488.70]  to use
[1488.70 --> 1489.96]  so to speak?
[1490.30 --> 1490.96]  Why were
[1490.96 --> 1491.74]  these religious
[1491.74 --> 1492.16]  leaders,
[1492.48 --> 1492.86]  why were they
[1492.86 --> 1493.42]  so angry
[1493.42 --> 1494.10]  and opposed?
[1495.04 --> 1495.82]  And then secondly
[1495.82 --> 1497.20]  how did
[1497.20 --> 1498.30]  Peter and
[1498.30 --> 1499.40]  John respond?
[1500.14 --> 1500.66]  So what was
[1500.66 --> 1501.42]  the response
[1501.42 --> 1501.96]  to the healing
[1501.96 --> 1502.58]  and what was
[1502.58 --> 1503.14]  the response
[1503.14 --> 1503.74]  to the response
[1503.74 --> 1504.46]  to the healings?
[1504.92 --> 1505.62]  It's kind of like that.
[1506.10 --> 1506.60]  So let's look
[1506.60 --> 1507.30]  at those two things
[1507.30 --> 1508.12]  and see what we
[1508.12 --> 1508.58]  can take away
[1508.58 --> 1508.90]  from it.
[1510.32 --> 1511.38]  So first
[1511.38 --> 1512.68]  why were
[1512.68 --> 1513.52]  their feathers
[1513.52 --> 1513.88]  ruffled?
[1514.58 --> 1515.44]  And we'll look
[1515.44 --> 1516.52]  at verses 1 and 2.
[1516.70 --> 1517.30]  I'll read it again
[1517.30 --> 1517.76]  for us.
[1518.34 --> 1518.88]  The priests
[1518.88 --> 1519.46]  and the captain
[1519.46 --> 1520.02]  of the temple
[1520.02 --> 1521.24]  guard and the Sadducees
[1521.24 --> 1522.08]  came up to Peter
[1522.08 --> 1522.52]  and John
[1522.52 --> 1523.56]  while they were
[1523.56 --> 1524.40]  speaking to the people.
[1525.48 --> 1526.48]  They were greatly
[1526.48 --> 1527.38]  disturbed
[1527.38 --> 1528.90]  because the apostles
[1528.90 --> 1529.66]  were teaching
[1529.66 --> 1530.50]  the people
[1530.50 --> 1531.78]  proclaiming
[1531.78 --> 1532.48]  in Jesus
[1532.48 --> 1533.68]  the resurrection
[1533.68 --> 1534.80]  of the dead.
[1535.66 --> 1536.36]  And so all the
[1536.36 --> 1537.00]  leaders of the
[1537.00 --> 1537.76]  high priestly
[1537.76 --> 1538.70]  court are here.
[1539.32 --> 1540.00]  And we have to
[1540.00 --> 1540.72]  remember that
[1540.72 --> 1541.28]  these were
[1541.28 --> 1542.14]  the very same
[1542.14 --> 1542.62]  people
[1542.62 --> 1544.12]  who seven weeks
[1544.12 --> 1544.82]  earlier
[1544.82 --> 1546.28]  put Jesus
[1546.28 --> 1547.28]  on trial
[1547.28 --> 1548.36]  and handed
[1548.36 --> 1548.94]  him over
[1548.94 --> 1549.92]  to the Romans
[1549.92 --> 1551.24]  to be crucified.
[1552.04 --> 1552.96]  And you can imagine
[1552.96 --> 1554.00]  how incredibly
[1554.00 --> 1554.76]  intimidating
[1554.76 --> 1555.68]  this would be.
[1556.30 --> 1556.52]  Right?
[1556.56 --> 1557.10]  You're surrounded
[1557.10 --> 1557.76]  by these men
[1557.76 --> 1558.26]  who actually
[1558.26 --> 1559.00]  have the power
[1559.00 --> 1560.62]  to turn you over
[1560.62 --> 1561.70]  and have you killed.
[1562.06 --> 1562.70]  So I imagine
[1562.70 --> 1563.42]  as Peter and John
[1563.42 --> 1564.14]  are standing there
[1564.14 --> 1564.84]  this is going
[1564.84 --> 1565.84]  through their minds.
[1567.36 --> 1568.02]  And notice
[1568.02 --> 1568.90]  that it says
[1568.90 --> 1569.88]  that they were
[1569.88 --> 1571.30]  greatly disturbed.
[1572.22 --> 1573.22]  And it's a word
[1573.22 --> 1574.00]  that means
[1574.00 --> 1574.96]  to be kind of
[1574.96 --> 1575.54]  vexed,
[1575.58 --> 1576.34]  to be bothered.
[1576.90 --> 1577.78]  Some translations
[1577.78 --> 1578.22]  just say
[1578.22 --> 1579.06]  they were annoyed
[1579.06 --> 1579.82]  which kind of
[1579.82 --> 1580.48]  doesn't really get
[1580.48 --> 1580.88]  to it because
[1580.88 --> 1581.58]  we're annoyed a lot.
[1581.86 --> 1582.54]  But they were
[1582.54 --> 1583.28]  like indignant.
[1583.44 --> 1584.20]  They were angry.
[1585.28 --> 1585.80]  And so we need
[1585.80 --> 1586.42]  to understand
[1586.42 --> 1587.78]  what are the reasons
[1587.78 --> 1589.46]  why they were
[1589.46 --> 1590.44]  so angry.
[1591.44 --> 1592.04]  And so there's
[1592.04 --> 1593.40]  three primary reasons.
[1593.70 --> 1594.08]  First,
[1594.20 --> 1594.84]  they were angry
[1594.84 --> 1596.02]  that Peter and John
[1596.02 --> 1597.54]  were teaching at all.
[1597.54 --> 1599.34]  It says down
[1599.34 --> 1600.26]  in verse 13
[1600.26 --> 1601.56]  that they were
[1601.56 --> 1603.28]  unschooled
[1603.28 --> 1604.22]  ordinary men.
[1605.14 --> 1605.86]  Now this doesn't
[1605.86 --> 1606.90]  mean that Peter and John
[1606.90 --> 1607.70]  were not intelligent
[1607.70 --> 1608.54]  or eloquent.
[1609.08 --> 1609.96]  It means that
[1609.96 --> 1611.06]  they were not trained
[1611.06 --> 1612.48]  at the Levitical
[1612.48 --> 1614.92]  schools for the priesthood.
[1615.00 --> 1616.10]  They weren't brought up
[1616.10 --> 1616.76]  as rabbi.
[1618.52 --> 1619.84]  So then in verse 7
[1619.84 --> 1622.48]  they had Peter and John
[1622.48 --> 1623.70]  brought before them
[1623.70 --> 1625.32]  and began to question them
[1625.32 --> 1626.72]  By what power
[1626.72 --> 1627.50]  or name
[1627.50 --> 1629.14]  did you do this?
[1630.32 --> 1631.26]  And I want you
[1631.26 --> 1631.96]  to see that
[1631.96 --> 1633.02]  this is a threat.
[1634.30 --> 1635.24]  When it says
[1635.24 --> 1636.10]  by what power
[1636.10 --> 1637.34]  or by what name
[1637.34 --> 1638.02]  did you do this
[1638.02 --> 1639.02]  it means by what
[1639.02 --> 1639.78]  authority.
[1640.50 --> 1640.62]  Right?
[1641.40 --> 1641.92]  They're saying
[1641.92 --> 1643.84]  we are the only ones
[1643.84 --> 1644.88]  who truly have
[1644.88 --> 1645.48]  the authority
[1645.48 --> 1646.76]  to be representatives
[1646.76 --> 1648.24]  of God
[1648.24 --> 1649.22]  in this place.
[1649.70 --> 1649.82]  Right?
[1649.90 --> 1650.66]  This is the temple
[1650.66 --> 1651.26]  of God.
[1651.62 --> 1653.22]  We are the priesthood.
[1653.22 --> 1655.18]  How dare you
[1655.18 --> 1656.54]  untrained
[1656.54 --> 1657.62]  uneducated men
[1657.62 --> 1659.20]  come into our midst
[1659.20 --> 1660.80]  and teach?
[1661.66 --> 1662.56]  So they were doing
[1662.56 --> 1663.16]  something that was
[1663.16 --> 1664.00]  actually against
[1664.00 --> 1664.76]  the Jewish law.
[1665.28 --> 1666.30]  They were taking it
[1666.30 --> 1667.52]  upon themselves
[1667.52 --> 1668.28]  to be teachers
[1668.28 --> 1669.02]  of the people.
[1669.70 --> 1670.62]  And they were teaching
[1670.62 --> 1671.38]  in a way that was
[1671.38 --> 1673.10]  contrary to what
[1673.10 --> 1673.90]  the Jewish leaders
[1673.90 --> 1674.40]  were teaching.
[1674.54 --> 1676.14]  So they were angry
[1676.14 --> 1678.10]  about them doing this.
[1679.40 --> 1680.00]  Secondly
[1680.00 --> 1681.76]  they were really
[1681.76 --> 1682.26]  angry
[1682.26 --> 1683.04]  that they were
[1683.04 --> 1684.04]  teaching about Jesus.
[1684.80 --> 1685.24]  Because
[1685.24 --> 1686.70]  not many weeks
[1686.70 --> 1687.36]  had passed
[1687.36 --> 1688.88]  since this group
[1688.88 --> 1690.02]  had taken part
[1690.02 --> 1691.10]  in the condemnation
[1691.10 --> 1692.14]  and arrest of Jesus.
[1692.98 --> 1693.18]  Right?
[1693.28 --> 1694.48]  Only to find now
[1694.48 --> 1695.74]  that he has
[1695.74 --> 1696.62]  they have an even
[1696.62 --> 1697.54]  greater problem
[1697.54 --> 1699.60]  than when he was gone.
[1700.24 --> 1701.30]  Because now
[1701.30 --> 1702.10]  Jesus is being
[1702.10 --> 1702.60]  proclaimed
[1702.60 --> 1704.08]  and he's being
[1704.08 --> 1705.32]  proclaimed with power.
[1705.90 --> 1706.56]  And now
[1706.56 --> 1707.42]  there are more
[1707.42 --> 1708.08]  converts
[1708.08 --> 1709.30]  people following Jesus
[1709.30 --> 1710.20]  after his death
[1710.20 --> 1711.44]  than there was
[1711.44 --> 1712.36]  when he was alive.
[1713.36 --> 1714.34]  And so you can imagine
[1714.34 --> 1715.20]  the frustration
[1715.20 --> 1715.86]  they were feeling
[1715.86 --> 1716.48]  like we finally
[1716.48 --> 1717.68]  got rid of this guy
[1717.68 --> 1719.48]  and now they're
[1719.48 --> 1720.72]  speaking in this
[1720.72 --> 1721.42]  name again
[1721.42 --> 1722.42]  and amazing
[1722.42 --> 1723.10]  things are happening
[1723.10 --> 1724.16]  and people are following.
[1724.64 --> 1725.72]  So they're angry.
[1726.98 --> 1727.54]  But third
[1727.54 --> 1729.28]  they were upset
[1729.28 --> 1730.30]  because they were
[1730.30 --> 1731.66]  proclaiming in Jesus
[1731.66 --> 1733.24]  the resurrection
[1733.24 --> 1734.18]  of the dead.
[1735.10 --> 1735.82]  Because see
[1735.82 --> 1736.60]  in this group
[1736.60 --> 1738.36]  were the Sadducees.
[1739.32 --> 1740.60]  And a little
[1740.60 --> 1741.10]  kind of
[1741.10 --> 1742.04]  way to remember
[1742.04 --> 1744.22]  is the Sadducees
[1744.22 --> 1744.74]  didn't believe
[1744.74 --> 1745.32]  in the resurrection
[1745.32 --> 1746.70]  because they are sad
[1746.70 --> 1747.16]  you see.
[1748.46 --> 1748.74]  Okay.
[1749.22 --> 1750.26]  You probably heard that.
[1750.38 --> 1751.24]  But it does help me
[1751.24 --> 1751.88]  still today.
[1752.42 --> 1753.12]  The Sadducees
[1753.12 --> 1753.70]  were the group
[1753.70 --> 1754.86]  that don't believe
[1754.86 --> 1755.46]  in the resurrection.
[1756.20 --> 1756.90]  And Peter and John
[1756.90 --> 1757.84]  not only proclaimed
[1757.84 --> 1758.56]  the power
[1758.56 --> 1759.16]  and the authority
[1759.16 --> 1760.22]  of Jesus to heal
[1760.22 --> 1761.68]  but they actually
[1761.68 --> 1762.36]  claimed
[1762.36 --> 1763.54]  that this Jesus
[1763.54 --> 1764.88]  who they had killed
[1764.88 --> 1766.58]  God raised
[1766.58 --> 1767.46]  from the dead.
[1768.32 --> 1769.08]  And not only
[1769.08 --> 1769.64]  did they say
[1769.64 --> 1770.38]  that Jesus rose
[1770.38 --> 1771.14]  from the dead
[1771.14 --> 1772.18]  but that any
[1772.18 --> 1772.74]  who put their
[1772.74 --> 1773.70]  trust in Jesus
[1773.70 --> 1775.26]  would also
[1775.26 --> 1776.24]  experience
[1776.24 --> 1777.10]  resurrection
[1777.10 --> 1777.98]  of life.
[1779.04 --> 1779.44]  And so they
[1779.44 --> 1780.08]  were preaching
[1780.08 --> 1780.80]  a doctrine
[1780.80 --> 1781.44]  that many
[1781.44 --> 1782.54]  in this religious
[1782.54 --> 1783.02]  group
[1783.02 --> 1784.54]  found heretical.
[1785.94 --> 1786.52]  So
[1786.52 --> 1787.80]  as we say
[1787.80 --> 1788.56]  their feathers
[1788.56 --> 1789.74]  were ruffled.
[1789.92 --> 1790.82]  They were indignant.
[1791.92 --> 1792.32]  And as
[1792.32 --> 1793.10]  theologian
[1793.10 --> 1793.88]  John Stott
[1793.88 --> 1794.46]  says
[1794.46 --> 1795.42]  given
[1795.42 --> 1796.36]  their
[1796.36 --> 1797.18]  Peter and John's
[1797.18 --> 1798.32]  social position
[1798.32 --> 1799.48]  which is low
[1799.48 --> 1800.70]  their beliefs
[1800.70 --> 1801.80]  which were heretical
[1801.80 --> 1803.38]  the high priestly
[1803.38 --> 1804.18]  court saw them
[1804.18 --> 1804.66]  both as
[1804.66 --> 1806.04]  disturbers of the peace
[1806.04 --> 1807.14]  and enemies
[1807.14 --> 1808.06]  of the truth.
[1809.82 --> 1810.98]  Now notice
[1810.98 --> 1812.48]  they didn't have
[1812.48 --> 1813.30]  any problem
[1813.30 --> 1814.10]  with the healing
[1814.10 --> 1814.78]  itself.
[1815.98 --> 1816.10]  Right.
[1816.18 --> 1816.82]  In fact
[1816.82 --> 1818.50]  if we care
[1818.50 --> 1819.14]  for the needs
[1819.14 --> 1819.80]  of our neighbors
[1819.80 --> 1821.40]  and if we attend
[1821.40 --> 1822.62]  to the whole person
[1822.62 --> 1824.12]  we will often
[1824.12 --> 1825.10]  win the admiration
[1825.10 --> 1825.78]  and respect
[1825.78 --> 1826.56]  of others
[1826.56 --> 1828.18]  not their
[1828.18 --> 1828.94]  hostility.
[1829.94 --> 1830.80]  At the very
[1830.80 --> 1831.32]  least
[1831.32 --> 1831.92]  it may
[1831.92 --> 1832.94]  silence
[1832.94 --> 1833.86]  antagonists
[1833.86 --> 1834.76]  as we see
[1834.76 --> 1835.56]  in verse 14
[1835.56 --> 1836.12]  it says
[1836.12 --> 1837.28]  since they could
[1837.28 --> 1838.62]  see the man
[1838.62 --> 1839.06]  who had been
[1839.06 --> 1839.80]  healed standing
[1839.80 --> 1840.44]  there with them
[1840.44 --> 1841.02]  there was nothing
[1841.02 --> 1841.80]  they could say.
[1843.08 --> 1843.98]  And so for us
[1843.98 --> 1844.40]  one
[1844.40 --> 1845.86]  great witness
[1845.86 --> 1846.94]  to the truth
[1846.94 --> 1847.76]  that we proclaim
[1847.76 --> 1849.22]  is when we care
[1849.22 --> 1849.96]  for other people
[1849.96 --> 1850.46]  and there's nothing
[1850.46 --> 1851.12]  you can say
[1851.12 --> 1851.76]  against that.
[1854.04 --> 1855.00]  But the question
[1855.00 --> 1855.84]  for the religious
[1855.84 --> 1856.96]  leaders is
[1856.96 --> 1858.90]  then how do we
[1858.90 --> 1859.68]  confront something
[1859.68 --> 1860.28]  that's good?
[1860.64 --> 1861.70]  They're doing good.
[1862.18 --> 1862.84]  All the people
[1862.84 --> 1863.50]  recognize it.
[1863.56 --> 1864.56]  They healed this man
[1864.56 --> 1865.92]  we can't deny it
[1865.92 --> 1867.56]  but we can't let them
[1867.56 --> 1868.28]  preach in the name
[1868.28 --> 1868.80]  of Jesus
[1868.80 --> 1869.78]  because this
[1869.78 --> 1870.18]  threatens
[1870.18 --> 1871.52]  our power
[1871.52 --> 1872.34]  it threatens
[1872.34 --> 1873.10]  our beliefs
[1873.10 --> 1873.50]  it threatens
[1873.50 --> 1874.20]  the whole system.
[1875.14 --> 1876.02]  So what do they
[1876.02 --> 1876.84]  decide to do?
[1877.84 --> 1878.90]  Verse 18 says
[1878.90 --> 1880.16]  they called them
[1880.16 --> 1880.78]  in again
[1880.78 --> 1882.06]  and commanded
[1882.06 --> 1882.48]  them
[1882.48 --> 1883.84]  not to speak
[1883.84 --> 1884.60]  or teach
[1884.60 --> 1885.28]  at all
[1885.28 --> 1886.54]  in the name
[1886.54 --> 1887.04]  of Jesus.
[1887.30 --> 1888.20]  Don't say
[1888.20 --> 1888.52]  the name
[1888.52 --> 1888.82]  of Jesus
[1888.82 --> 1889.20]  we don't want
[1889.20 --> 1889.88]  to hear it again.
[1891.46 --> 1892.42]  And what we see
[1892.42 --> 1892.86]  here
[1892.86 --> 1893.92]  is that this
[1893.92 --> 1894.80]  is the very
[1894.80 --> 1895.30]  beginning
[1895.30 --> 1896.58]  of persecution
[1896.58 --> 1897.38]  against the
[1897.38 --> 1898.02]  Christian church.
[1898.86 --> 1899.78]  And it begins
[1899.78 --> 1900.74]  here with
[1900.74 --> 1902.12]  intimidation
[1902.12 --> 1903.80]  or psychological
[1903.80 --> 1905.06]  persecution
[1905.06 --> 1906.38]  but soon
[1906.38 --> 1907.28]  as we will see
[1907.28 --> 1907.88]  it's going to
[1907.88 --> 1908.40]  move towards
[1908.40 --> 1909.38]  physical persecution.
[1911.26 --> 1911.48]  You know
[1911.48 --> 1911.94]  in thinking
[1911.94 --> 1912.66]  about our
[1912.66 --> 1913.48]  culture today
[1913.48 --> 1914.10]  in the west
[1914.10 --> 1915.24]  we do not
[1915.24 --> 1915.88]  now
[1915.88 --> 1916.98]  in most cases
[1916.98 --> 1917.58]  have
[1917.58 --> 1919.44]  authority figures
[1919.44 --> 1920.60]  forbidding us
[1920.60 --> 1921.24]  from telling
[1921.24 --> 1921.94]  the story
[1921.94 --> 1922.40]  of Jesus.
[1923.44 --> 1924.84]  But in this age
[1924.84 --> 1925.46]  we know that
[1925.46 --> 1926.12]  there is
[1926.12 --> 1927.00]  an authority
[1927.00 --> 1928.58]  in the air
[1928.58 --> 1928.98]  right?
[1929.06 --> 1929.86]  That's almost
[1929.86 --> 1930.66]  palatable.
[1932.88 --> 1934.04]  Unwritten laws
[1934.04 --> 1934.62]  right?
[1934.70 --> 1935.20]  That are telling
[1935.20 --> 1935.78]  us to keep
[1935.78 --> 1936.46]  the story
[1936.46 --> 1938.10]  to ourselves.
[1938.80 --> 1939.50]  Telling us
[1939.50 --> 1940.42]  not to say
[1940.42 --> 1940.94]  that there is
[1940.94 --> 1941.38]  a truth
[1941.38 --> 1942.00]  in the world
[1942.00 --> 1942.78]  that is true
[1942.78 --> 1943.48]  and life-giving
[1943.48 --> 1944.78]  for absolutely
[1944.78 --> 1945.52]  everybody
[1945.52 --> 1946.94]  in every way.
[1948.14 --> 1949.34]  And what happens
[1949.34 --> 1950.02]  is because
[1950.02 --> 1950.56]  of this
[1950.56 --> 1951.18]  it slowly
[1951.18 --> 1952.18]  whittles away
[1952.18 --> 1952.96]  the foundations
[1952.96 --> 1953.78]  of the church
[1953.78 --> 1954.98]  as we try
[1954.98 --> 1955.78]  to find ways
[1955.78 --> 1956.58]  to accommodate
[1956.58 --> 1957.18]  the message
[1957.18 --> 1957.96]  of Christianity
[1957.96 --> 1959.56]  to modern
[1959.56 --> 1960.26]  sensibilities.
[1961.34 --> 1961.88]  And this is
[1961.88 --> 1962.56]  actually
[1962.56 --> 1963.94]  far more
[1963.94 --> 1964.54]  damaging
[1964.54 --> 1965.32]  and destructive
[1965.32 --> 1966.56]  to the church
[1966.56 --> 1968.56]  than physical
[1968.56 --> 1970.26]  life-threatening
[1970.26 --> 1970.90]  persecution.
[1972.12 --> 1972.74]  Because when we
[1972.74 --> 1973.20]  look at it
[1973.20 --> 1973.86]  historically
[1973.86 --> 1975.08]  the church
[1975.08 --> 1975.86]  even to this
[1975.86 --> 1976.46]  day has
[1976.46 --> 1977.60]  always thrived
[1977.60 --> 1978.24]  and actually
[1978.24 --> 1979.52]  exploded in
[1979.52 --> 1980.02]  growth
[1980.02 --> 1981.36]  when it comes
[1981.36 --> 1982.58]  under actual
[1982.58 --> 1983.94]  physical persecution.
[1984.98 --> 1985.48]  So if you
[1985.48 --> 1986.12]  consider
[1986.12 --> 1987.32]  Iran
[1987.32 --> 1988.32]  right now
[1988.32 --> 1989.50]  it's illegal
[1989.50 --> 1990.42]  to be a Christian
[1990.42 --> 1991.52]  in Iran.
[1991.52 --> 1992.42]  so you are
[1992.42 --> 1993.24]  running the risk
[1993.24 --> 1994.28]  of being thrown
[1994.28 --> 1994.76]  in jail
[1994.76 --> 1995.88]  or being
[1995.88 --> 1996.60]  executed
[1996.60 --> 1998.00]  for your
[1998.00 --> 1998.62]  faith
[1998.62 --> 2000.44]  if you
[2000.44 --> 2001.16]  get caught.
[2002.22 --> 2002.78]  And yet
[2002.78 --> 2004.00]  in Iran
[2004.00 --> 2004.78]  it is one
[2004.78 --> 2005.44]  of the fastest
[2005.44 --> 2006.48]  growing churches
[2006.48 --> 2007.44]  in the world.
[2008.60 --> 2009.12]  And so it seems
[2009.12 --> 2009.80]  that persecution
[2009.80 --> 2010.42]  hasn't done
[2010.42 --> 2011.28]  anything to
[2011.28 --> 2012.44]  squelch the
[2012.44 --> 2012.84]  gospel.
[2013.24 --> 2014.10]  If anything
[2014.10 --> 2014.98]  it's actually
[2014.98 --> 2016.26]  inflamed it.
[2016.50 --> 2016.84]  And there are
[2016.84 --> 2017.48]  more people
[2017.48 --> 2018.44]  coming to Christ
[2018.44 --> 2019.16]  because they see
[2019.16 --> 2019.74]  that there is
[2019.74 --> 2021.00]  something powerful
[2021.00 --> 2021.72]  and real
[2021.72 --> 2022.60]  that is being
[2022.60 --> 2023.08]  proclaimed.
[2024.40 --> 2025.44]  But in the
[2025.44 --> 2025.96]  West
[2025.96 --> 2027.52]  we have the
[2027.52 --> 2028.04]  freedom to
[2028.04 --> 2028.30]  worship
[2028.30 --> 2029.58]  how we see
[2029.58 --> 2030.02]  fit.
[2030.56 --> 2031.54]  But we live
[2031.54 --> 2032.22]  in a culture
[2032.22 --> 2032.54]  that is
[2032.54 --> 2033.22]  increasingly
[2033.22 --> 2034.42]  intellectually
[2034.42 --> 2035.26]  and emotionally
[2035.26 --> 2035.86]  hostile
[2035.86 --> 2036.88]  to what we
[2036.88 --> 2037.34]  believe.
[2038.10 --> 2038.94]  And it's an
[2038.94 --> 2039.90]  incredible threat
[2039.90 --> 2040.94]  to the church.
[2041.64 --> 2042.22]  And it's
[2042.22 --> 2043.06]  Satan's
[2043.06 --> 2044.54]  greatest attack
[2044.54 --> 2045.42]  against the church
[2045.42 --> 2046.16]  because it doesn't
[2046.16 --> 2046.90]  kill us
[2046.90 --> 2048.22]  it just
[2048.22 --> 2048.76]  makes us
[2048.76 --> 2049.32]  compromise.
[2051.46 --> 2052.12]  And so we
[2052.12 --> 2052.74]  have seen
[2052.74 --> 2053.20]  kind of
[2053.20 --> 2053.86]  throughout history
[2053.86 --> 2054.82]  different movements
[2054.82 --> 2055.62]  come and go
[2055.62 --> 2056.32]  that are
[2056.32 --> 2056.88]  attempting to
[2056.88 --> 2057.20]  try to
[2057.20 --> 2057.68]  reconcile
[2057.68 --> 2058.40]  the Christian
[2058.40 --> 2058.90]  faith
[2058.90 --> 2060.26]  with modern
[2060.26 --> 2061.42]  cultural norms
[2061.42 --> 2062.06]  that are always
[2062.06 --> 2062.54]  changing.
[2063.06 --> 2063.46]  Right?
[2063.50 --> 2063.90]  To try to
[2063.90 --> 2064.70]  reduce the
[2064.70 --> 2065.20]  ethics and
[2065.20 --> 2065.62]  the teachings
[2065.62 --> 2066.22]  of Jesus
[2066.22 --> 2067.46]  to make
[2067.46 --> 2067.96]  them more
[2067.96 --> 2068.64]  palatable
[2068.64 --> 2069.18]  and less
[2069.18 --> 2069.72]  offensive
[2069.72 --> 2071.56]  to our
[2071.56 --> 2072.14]  contemporary
[2072.14 --> 2072.82]  sensibilities.
[2074.10 --> 2074.90]  And all
[2074.90 --> 2075.46]  the while
[2075.46 --> 2075.80]  though
[2075.80 --> 2077.20]  what happens
[2077.20 --> 2078.20]  is that
[2078.20 --> 2078.54]  Jesus
[2078.54 --> 2079.20]  becomes
[2079.20 --> 2079.44]  an
[2079.44 --> 2080.18]  unwelcomed
[2080.18 --> 2080.70]  guest
[2080.70 --> 2081.08]  in his
[2081.08 --> 2081.26]  own
[2081.26 --> 2081.50]  home.
[2083.02 --> 2083.60]  And I
[2083.60 --> 2083.98]  think this
[2083.98 --> 2084.36]  passage
[2084.36 --> 2084.98]  before us
[2084.98 --> 2085.46]  shows us
[2085.46 --> 2086.20]  how it
[2086.20 --> 2086.66]  is we
[2086.66 --> 2086.96]  are to
[2086.96 --> 2087.74]  stand up
[2087.74 --> 2088.22]  to this
[2088.22 --> 2088.70]  challenge.
[2089.62 --> 2090.14]  So how
[2090.14 --> 2091.12]  do we
[2091.12 --> 2092.24]  resist
[2092.24 --> 2092.84]  persecution?
[2093.20 --> 2093.50]  Do we
[2093.50 --> 2094.06]  take up
[2094.06 --> 2094.52]  arms?
[2095.38 --> 2095.80]  No.
[2096.68 --> 2097.62]  We resist
[2097.62 --> 2098.44]  persecution
[2098.44 --> 2100.70]  by faithful
[2100.70 --> 2101.80]  disobedience.
[2102.56 --> 2102.70]  Okay?
[2102.76 --> 2102.96]  And by
[2102.96 --> 2103.54]  faithful
[2103.54 --> 2104.42]  disobedience
[2104.42 --> 2105.06]  I mean
[2105.06 --> 2105.70]  that we
[2105.70 --> 2106.48]  faithfully
[2106.48 --> 2107.22]  proclaim
[2107.22 --> 2107.84]  the gospel
[2107.84 --> 2109.50]  even if
[2109.50 --> 2109.84]  we have
[2109.84 --> 2110.66]  to disobey
[2110.66 --> 2111.88]  the authorities
[2111.88 --> 2112.40]  to do
[2112.40 --> 2113.72]  so and
[2113.72 --> 2114.30]  we accept
[2114.30 --> 2115.08]  the consequences.
[2115.82 --> 2116.00]  Okay?
[2116.02 --> 2116.60]  We faithfully
[2116.60 --> 2117.18]  proclaim
[2117.18 --> 2118.82]  and we're
[2118.82 --> 2119.58]  disobedient
[2119.58 --> 2120.20]  but we
[2120.20 --> 2120.78]  accept the
[2120.78 --> 2121.34]  consequences.
[2121.54 --> 2121.76]  We're not
[2121.76 --> 2122.28]  trying to
[2122.28 --> 2123.34]  fight or
[2123.34 --> 2123.56]  we're not
[2123.56 --> 2123.96]  trying to
[2123.96 --> 2124.42]  overturn
[2124.42 --> 2125.10]  governments.
[2125.62 --> 2126.10]  We accept
[2126.10 --> 2126.82]  the consequences
[2126.82 --> 2127.44]  trusting that
[2127.44 --> 2128.06]  God has put
[2128.06 --> 2128.40]  governing
[2128.40 --> 2129.26]  authorities in
[2129.26 --> 2129.84]  their place
[2129.84 --> 2130.82]  for our
[2130.82 --> 2131.14]  good.
[2131.14 --> 2132.64]  So the
[2132.64 --> 2133.28]  question now
[2133.28 --> 2134.96]  is how
[2134.96 --> 2135.48]  do we
[2135.48 --> 2136.16]  respond?
[2137.38 --> 2137.58]  Right?
[2137.72 --> 2138.72]  And so what
[2138.72 --> 2139.24]  we just said
[2139.24 --> 2139.86]  leads to this
[2139.86 --> 2140.50]  second point
[2140.50 --> 2141.28]  and we look
[2141.28 --> 2141.70]  at how did
[2141.70 --> 2142.24]  Peter and
[2142.24 --> 2143.24]  James respond?
[2144.36 --> 2144.80]  And so for
[2144.80 --> 2145.20]  the most
[2145.20 --> 2147.32]  part Peter
[2147.32 --> 2148.00]  has been
[2148.00 --> 2148.82]  preaching the
[2148.82 --> 2149.72]  gospel right
[2149.72 --> 2150.66]  back in Acts
[2150.66 --> 2151.78]  chapter 2.
[2152.08 --> 2152.66]  He's preaching
[2152.66 --> 2153.84]  the gospel and
[2153.84 --> 2154.58]  people are getting
[2154.58 --> 2155.26]  saved and being
[2155.26 --> 2155.86]  added to the
[2155.86 --> 2156.16]  church.
[2156.72 --> 2156.94]  Right?
[2156.98 --> 2157.34]  And then he
[2157.34 --> 2157.96]  heals a man
[2157.96 --> 2158.46]  in the name of
[2158.46 --> 2159.52]  Jesus and he
[2159.52 --> 2160.00]  preaches the
[2160.00 --> 2160.70]  gospel and it
[2160.70 --> 2161.72]  says 5,000 more
[2161.72 --> 2162.34]  are added to
[2162.34 --> 2162.80]  the church.
[2163.14 --> 2163.46]  And he's
[2163.46 --> 2164.26]  like wow
[2164.26 --> 2164.86]  this is going
[2164.86 --> 2165.24]  awesome.
[2166.58 --> 2167.38]  And then he's
[2167.38 --> 2168.46]  immediately arrested.
[2169.62 --> 2170.48]  He's surrounded
[2170.48 --> 2171.54]  by the top
[2171.54 --> 2172.20]  dogs, the
[2172.20 --> 2172.94]  religious leaders
[2172.94 --> 2173.60]  of the day
[2173.60 --> 2174.54]  and now his
[2174.54 --> 2175.26]  life is on
[2175.26 --> 2176.98]  the line and
[2176.98 --> 2178.92]  he already saw
[2178.92 --> 2179.76]  what they did
[2179.76 --> 2180.34]  to Jesus.
[2181.44 --> 2182.34]  And so knowing
[2182.34 --> 2183.44]  Peter's history
[2183.44 --> 2185.12]  we have to
[2185.12 --> 2186.76]  wonder how is
[2186.76 --> 2187.56]  Peter going to
[2187.56 --> 2188.06]  respond?
[2188.80 --> 2189.40]  How is he going
[2189.40 --> 2190.18]  to react right
[2190.18 --> 2190.44]  now?
[2190.70 --> 2192.08]  And so let's
[2192.08 --> 2192.74]  begin reading
[2192.74 --> 2194.12]  in verse 8.
[2195.98 --> 2196.62]  It says
[2196.62 --> 2197.28]  then Peter
[2197.28 --> 2198.32]  filled with the
[2198.32 --> 2198.88]  Holy Spirit
[2198.88 --> 2199.80]  said to them
[2199.80 --> 2201.14]  rulers and
[2201.14 --> 2201.74]  elders of the
[2201.74 --> 2202.96]  people if we
[2202.96 --> 2203.58]  are being called
[2203.58 --> 2204.44]  to account today
[2204.44 --> 2205.24]  for an act of
[2205.24 --> 2205.96]  kindness shown
[2205.96 --> 2207.04]  to a man who
[2207.04 --> 2208.16]  is lame and
[2208.16 --> 2210.10]  are being asked
[2210.10 --> 2210.80]  how he was
[2210.80 --> 2211.98]  healed then
[2211.98 --> 2213.54]  know this you
[2213.54 --> 2213.98]  and all the
[2213.98 --> 2214.76]  people of Israel
[2214.76 --> 2216.20]  it is by the
[2216.20 --> 2217.10]  name of Jesus
[2217.10 --> 2217.90]  Christ of
[2217.90 --> 2219.20]  Nazareth whom
[2219.20 --> 2220.12]  you crucified
[2220.12 --> 2221.14]  whom God
[2221.14 --> 2221.60]  raised from
[2221.60 --> 2222.04]  the dead
[2222.04 --> 2222.76]  that this
[2222.76 --> 2223.46]  man stands
[2223.46 --> 2223.98]  before you
[2223.98 --> 2224.42]  healed.
[2225.36 --> 2226.26]  Jesus is the
[2226.26 --> 2227.12]  stone you
[2227.12 --> 2228.04]  builders rejected
[2228.04 --> 2229.52]  which has become
[2229.52 --> 2230.48]  the cornerstone
[2230.48 --> 2232.16]  salvation is found
[2232.16 --> 2233.16]  in no one else
[2233.16 --> 2234.32]  for there is no
[2234.32 --> 2235.10]  other name under
[2235.10 --> 2236.02]  heaven given to
[2236.02 --> 2237.74]  mankind by which
[2237.74 --> 2238.90]  we must be
[2238.90 --> 2239.54]  saved.
[2239.54 --> 2241.92]  wow right
[2241.92 --> 2243.52]  Peter and
[2243.52 --> 2244.24]  John they
[2244.24 --> 2245.14]  just they
[2245.14 --> 2245.74]  nail it.
[2246.20 --> 2246.90]  They proclaim
[2246.90 --> 2248.08]  Christ they're
[2248.08 --> 2249.28]  fearless they're
[2249.28 --> 2251.12]  courageous so
[2251.12 --> 2252.58]  what happened to
[2252.58 --> 2253.26]  the Peter of the
[2253.26 --> 2254.92]  Gospels right if
[2254.92 --> 2255.72]  we remember Peter
[2255.72 --> 2257.20]  in the Gospels on
[2257.20 --> 2257.78]  the night of
[2257.78 --> 2258.72]  Jesus's betrayal
[2258.72 --> 2259.94]  Jesus said to
[2259.94 --> 2260.70]  all his disciples
[2260.70 --> 2262.56]  listen you're all
[2262.56 --> 2263.26]  going to leave
[2263.26 --> 2264.68]  me right and
[2264.68 --> 2266.14]  Peter said Lord I
[2266.14 --> 2266.68]  would never
[2266.68 --> 2267.60]  abandon you I
[2267.60 --> 2268.46]  will lay down my
[2268.46 --> 2270.52]  life for you and
[2270.52 --> 2271.88]  what's Peter Jesus
[2271.88 --> 2272.94]  response to Peter
[2272.94 --> 2274.32]  he says Peter
[2274.32 --> 2275.24]  before the rooster
[2275.24 --> 2276.00]  crows you will
[2276.00 --> 2276.70]  deny me three
[2276.70 --> 2278.42]  times and Peter
[2278.42 --> 2279.62]  says I will never
[2279.62 --> 2280.38]  deny you and
[2280.38 --> 2280.94]  Peter's just like
[2280.94 --> 2282.58]  stop yes you
[2282.58 --> 2284.90]  will and that
[2284.90 --> 2285.86]  night when Peter
[2285.86 --> 2286.88]  sees Jesus
[2286.88 --> 2288.40]  arrested the
[2288.40 --> 2289.66]  threat of physical
[2289.66 --> 2291.62]  danger sinks in
[2291.62 --> 2294.08]  and he becomes a
[2294.08 --> 2295.30]  coward in the face
[2295.30 --> 2296.26]  of real persecution
[2296.26 --> 2297.56]  and when the
[2297.56 --> 2298.26]  servant girl
[2298.26 --> 2299.12]  girl sees Peter
[2299.12 --> 2299.78]  there who had
[2299.78 --> 2300.52]  followed Jesus
[2300.52 --> 2301.52]  he's outside the
[2301.52 --> 2304.90]  court and in the
[2304.90 --> 2305.92]  servant girl says
[2305.92 --> 2306.60]  hey you know
[2306.60 --> 2307.14]  weren't you with
[2307.14 --> 2309.20]  Jesus Peter denies
[2309.20 --> 2310.34]  it and he says I
[2310.34 --> 2311.52]  don't know the man
[2311.52 --> 2313.22]  and so he did deny
[2313.22 --> 2315.38]  Jesus but friends
[2315.38 --> 2316.50]  this is what Jesus
[2316.50 --> 2318.02]  is going to the
[2318.02 --> 2319.44]  cross for right
[2319.44 --> 2320.26]  this is why Jesus
[2320.26 --> 2321.32]  came because we
[2321.32 --> 2322.76]  can't and we will
[2322.76 --> 2324.16]  not on our own
[2324.16 --> 2326.76]  strength follow God
[2326.76 --> 2327.84]  and trust in God
[2327.84 --> 2329.36]  right we need
[2329.36 --> 2331.06]  Jesus's life to
[2331.06 --> 2333.68]  empower us and so
[2333.68 --> 2334.76]  then after his
[2334.76 --> 2335.90]  resurrection Jesus
[2335.90 --> 2337.64]  restores Peter he
[2337.64 --> 2339.64]  forgives him he says
[2339.64 --> 2340.50]  you know feed my
[2340.50 --> 2341.64]  sheep he restores him
[2341.64 --> 2342.42]  to leadership in the
[2342.42 --> 2344.02]  church and now the
[2344.02 --> 2345.10]  day of Pentecost has
[2345.10 --> 2346.90]  come empowering the
[2346.90 --> 2347.98]  church with Jesus's
[2347.98 --> 2348.92]  life and Jesus's
[2348.92 --> 2350.98]  presence and now
[2350.98 --> 2352.88]  Peter who was the
[2352.88 --> 2355.20]  denier becomes Peter
[2355.20 --> 2357.40]  the proclaimer and
[2357.40 --> 2359.38]  in this passage this
[2359.38 --> 2360.94]  is where his faith is
[2360.94 --> 2363.06]  truly tested because
[2363.06 --> 2364.90]  it was easy before he
[2364.90 --> 2365.94]  talked about Jesus and
[2365.94 --> 2367.58]  people come to faith and
[2367.58 --> 2368.66]  there's healings and it's
[2368.66 --> 2370.40]  exciting but here is the
[2370.40 --> 2372.22]  moment of testing he
[2372.22 --> 2373.60]  now has the choice will
[2373.60 --> 2377.02]  he cave in will he
[2377.02 --> 2378.90]  cowardly deny Jesus
[2378.90 --> 2380.40]  again in face of this
[2380.40 --> 2382.08]  pressure that will he
[2382.08 --> 2383.60]  just kind of say okay I
[2383.60 --> 2384.52]  won't say it again and
[2384.52 --> 2385.48]  just leave and that would
[2385.48 --> 2386.14]  be the end of the
[2386.14 --> 2388.58]  church or does he
[2388.58 --> 2391.72]  proclaim Jesus and the
[2391.72 --> 2392.98]  key to understanding
[2392.98 --> 2394.62]  Peter's transformation is
[2394.62 --> 2396.98]  this Peter is filled
[2396.98 --> 2397.92]  with the Holy Spirit
[2397.92 --> 2400.16]  this is the first thing
[2400.16 --> 2402.18]  it says in verse 8 as
[2402.18 --> 2403.84]  Peter begins to respond
[2403.84 --> 2405.92]  it says then Peter
[2405.92 --> 2408.42]  filled with the Holy
[2408.42 --> 2410.66]  Spirit said to them
[2410.66 --> 2413.46]  and so we need to
[2413.46 --> 2414.36]  understand this we
[2414.36 --> 2415.16]  begin to see this
[2415.16 --> 2416.10]  happening all throughout
[2416.10 --> 2417.54]  the book of Acts we
[2417.54 --> 2418.36]  need to understand like
[2418.36 --> 2419.38]  what does it mean to be
[2419.38 --> 2420.24]  filled with the Holy
[2420.24 --> 2422.12]  Spirit and sometimes we
[2422.12 --> 2423.20]  think you know that's
[2423.20 --> 2424.52]  something that you know
[2424.52 --> 2426.04]  maybe different churches
[2426.04 --> 2427.00]  talk about charismatic
[2427.00 --> 2428.32]  churches or Pentecostal
[2428.32 --> 2430.84]  churches we're reformed we
[2430.84 --> 2431.68]  don't talk about being
[2431.68 --> 2432.22]  filled with the Holy
[2432.22 --> 2433.88]  Spirit but actually this is
[2433.88 --> 2435.24]  for us too this is for the
[2435.24 --> 2437.42]  whole church and what we
[2437.42 --> 2439.80]  see happening is that the
[2439.80 --> 2441.68]  spirits filling throughout
[2441.68 --> 2443.04]  the book of Acts is it's
[2443.04 --> 2444.88]  immediately followed by
[2444.88 --> 2447.20]  bold proclamation because
[2447.20 --> 2449.68]  the Spirit's primary role is
[2449.68 --> 2451.52]  to witness to the reality and
[2451.52 --> 2453.00]  the truth of the living
[2453.00 --> 2454.70]  Christ right that's what the
[2454.70 --> 2456.46]  Holy Spirit does it's always
[2456.46 --> 2459.16]  pointing to Jesus and when
[2459.16 --> 2461.02]  the Holy Spirit comes into the
[2461.02 --> 2463.96]  human heart his work is to
[2463.96 --> 2466.68]  take the Lord's life his death
[2466.68 --> 2469.40]  his resurrection life and give
[2469.40 --> 2472.36]  it to us to enliven us take
[2472.36 --> 2475.14]  us from death to life but also
[2475.14 --> 2476.58]  to encourage us and to
[2476.58 --> 2479.52]  strengthen us and empower us to
[2479.52 --> 2482.22]  live out the Christian life and
[2482.22 --> 2483.94]  when the Spirit fills us the
[2483.94 --> 2487.18]  Bible says that the love of God is
[2487.18 --> 2491.56]  poured out into our hearts so
[2491.56 --> 2493.72]  friends what compels us to live
[2493.72 --> 2495.86]  differently in contrast to the
[2495.86 --> 2498.30]  world around us right to live
[2498.30 --> 2501.18]  against the pressure of the
[2501.18 --> 2503.02]  culture in which we live today
[2503.02 --> 2505.96]  and the only thing that will
[2505.96 --> 2509.08]  enable us to do that is if filled
[2509.08 --> 2511.06]  with the Holy Spirit we believe
[2511.06 --> 2513.74]  deeply in God's never-ending
[2513.74 --> 2517.02]  everlasting love for us and that
[2517.02 --> 2520.54]  our life is in him so to be
[2520.54 --> 2523.28]  spirit-filled is to be assured that
[2523.28 --> 2524.86]  God loves me with an everlasting
[2524.86 --> 2527.76]  love and then that moves us
[2527.76 --> 2532.06]  because we we are confident our
[2532.06 --> 2534.90]  life is in him we have nothing to be
[2534.90 --> 2536.14]  afraid of and that and that
[2536.14 --> 2537.86]  motivates us to then love our
[2537.86 --> 2540.12]  neighbors to tell them about Jesus
[2540.12 --> 2542.54]  we want to share God's love with
[2542.54 --> 2545.76]  them even at the risk of our own
[2545.76 --> 2549.08]  reputation or to be kind of seen as
[2549.08 --> 2552.08]  disturbers of the peace to be seen as
[2552.08 --> 2555.00]  heretics against the prevailing kind
[2555.00 --> 2557.52]  of truth that our culture holds to
[2557.52 --> 2560.24]  we will be labeled as heretics
[2560.24 --> 2564.72]  disturbers of the peace so we come to
[2564.72 --> 2566.42]  a verse I want to share with you
[2566.42 --> 2570.50]  second Timothy 1 7 says for the
[2570.50 --> 2573.26]  spirit of God gives us sorry the
[2573.26 --> 2575.48]  spirit God gave us does not make us
[2575.48 --> 2579.06]  timid but gives us power love and
[2579.06 --> 2581.96]  self-discipline so do not be ashamed
[2581.96 --> 2584.38]  of the testimony about our Lord rather
[2584.38 --> 2588.26]  join with me in suffering for the
[2588.26 --> 2588.70]  gospel
[2588.70 --> 2594.90]  so Peter instead of being fearful and
[2594.90 --> 2597.98]  timid was filled with the spirit and
[2597.98 --> 2601.02]  the spirit provided power and love to
[2601.02 --> 2605.06]  not be ashamed of Jesus so friends
[2605.06 --> 2608.40]  being ashamed of Jesus being ashamed
[2608.40 --> 2610.72]  at the name of Jesus is not part of the
[2610.72 --> 2614.82]  spirit-filled life do we all feel
[2614.82 --> 2617.16]  ashamed you know feel shame from time to
[2617.16 --> 2619.32]  time at the name of Jesus of course we
[2619.32 --> 2623.34]  do because we are weak we are timid we
[2623.34 --> 2627.10]  are we are sinners and this is why we
[2627.10 --> 2630.32]  need Christ because Jesus died he rose
[2630.32 --> 2632.76]  again he gave us his righteousness
[2632.76 --> 2634.42]  because we can't live the Christian
[2634.42 --> 2637.58]  life apart from the spirit so he died
[2637.58 --> 2640.20]  for us and he gave us the spirit so that
[2640.20 --> 2643.02]  we can live for Christ and proclaim him
[2643.02 --> 2645.58]  and the more that we yield to the
[2645.58 --> 2648.24]  spirit the more that we remember God's
[2648.24 --> 2650.16]  love for us the more we will understand
[2650.16 --> 2652.66]  that love and the more we understand his
[2652.66 --> 2655.24]  love the more we will want to share his
[2655.24 --> 2658.10]  love and that's what Peter wants for
[2658.10 --> 2660.82]  these Jewish leaders right Peter wants
[2660.82 --> 2662.90]  them to experience God's grace notice
[2662.90 --> 2665.24]  he's not angry at them he is perfectly
[2665.24 --> 2668.08]  respectful he's not trying to provoke
[2668.08 --> 2671.04]  them to anger he longs for them to know
[2671.04 --> 2675.46]  Jesus so that they would be saved and so
[2675.46 --> 2678.26]  he says in verse 12 there is salvation
[2678.26 --> 2681.26]  and no one else and friends this is the
[2681.26 --> 2683.18]  most offensive verse in the entire Bible
[2683.18 --> 2686.82]  it proclaims the exclusivity of the
[2686.82 --> 2688.36]  Christian faith there is salvation and
[2688.36 --> 2691.28]  no one else Jesus says I am the way and
[2691.28 --> 2693.08]  the truth and the life no one comes to
[2693.08 --> 2694.86]  the father except through me
[2694.86 --> 2700.46]  so is it exclusive and narrow to say that
[2700.46 --> 2702.94]  faith in Jesus is the only way to be made
[2702.94 --> 2706.94]  whole and receive life and the answer is
[2706.94 --> 2712.56]  yes it is to say that Jesus is the only way
[2712.56 --> 2717.06]  though is an invitation to everyone so it's
[2717.06 --> 2719.02]  it's not exclusive in that sense because
[2719.02 --> 2721.64]  it's for everybody no one is excluded from
[2721.64 --> 2723.92]  that invitation all right Jesus says come
[2723.92 --> 2727.16]  to me all who are weary and heavy laden and I
[2727.16 --> 2730.64]  will give you rest he says all who come to me I
[2730.64 --> 2735.58]  will by no means cast out his arms are open so
[2735.58 --> 2738.58]  the gospel is for everyone in God's heart is
[2738.58 --> 2741.52]  that all people would accept the salvation that
[2741.52 --> 2745.36]  he has provided through the death resurrection the
[2745.36 --> 2748.30]  perfecting complete work of his son Jesus Christ
[2748.30 --> 2757.76]  and so I'll close with this there's an amazing scene in the crown where the
[2757.76 --> 2761.96]  artist Graham Sutherland and Winston Churchill are discussing the painting
[2761.96 --> 2768.96]  after it has been revealed publicly to Parliament and Churchill when he sees the painting is angry
[2768.96 --> 2778.96]  and he says to Sutherland it is not a reasonable truthful image of me Sutherland says it is sir
[2778.96 --> 2790.96]  Winston Churchill says it is not it is cruel and Sutherland responds age is cruel if you if you see decay
[2790.96 --> 2803.80]  if you see decay it's because there is decay if you see frailty it's because there is frailty I cannot be blamed for what is and I refuse to hide and disguise what I see
[2803.80 --> 2818.72]  throughout their time together you know a friendship had kind of emerged as they begin to understand one another but that friendship didn't prevent Sutherland from interpreting reality truthfully
[2818.72 --> 2834.10]  and Churchill's position of power didn't lead him to compromise and not paint a portrait that was truthful and in the end Sutherland's bold interpretation ends up actually opening
[2834.10 --> 2841.10]  Churchill's eyes to see Churchill's eyes to see Churchill's eyes to see reality in a way that helps him move forward and find life in Sutherland's words
[2841.10 --> 2864.08]  and so friends the spirit-filled life doesn't lead us to compromise in the face of pressure not to speak about Jesus but the spirit leads us to a confident bold proclamation that is backed up by a life that is lived in humble love and grace toward those around us and that is a
[2864.08 --> 2871.08]  and so let me pray that God would help us
[2871.08 --> 2893.08]  Father we again we thank you and we need your help Lord when we face our neighbors who we know don't believe in Jesus and we have an opportunity Lord we feel timid we are sometimes fearful but Lord make us spirit-filled bold proclaimers of Christ Lord not to do so
[2893.08 --> 2910.08]  angrily but in love to offer the hope that we have within us because we desire all people to be saved Lord make us a church that would proclaim your love boldly we pray for your help in Jesus name Amen
[2910.08 --> 2910.88]  Amen
[2910.88 --> 2917.04]  So let us sing our song of response called Our Great God
[2917.04 --> 2947.02]  There combine we pray for today
[2947.02 --> 2949.02]  and unknown
[2949.62 --> 2952.86]  Your boundless
[2952.86 --> 2953.86]  love
[2953.86 --> 2955.02]  unfailing
[2956.04 --> 2958.60]  grace and
[2958.60 --> 2959.02]  mercy
[2959.62 --> 2961.02]  shown
[2961.02 --> 2962.72]  The
[2962.72 --> 2964.32]  Son of
[2964.32 --> 2965.02]  heaven
[2965.02 --> 2967.02]  ceaseless
[2967.02 --> 2967.62]  fight
[2967.62 --> 2969.02]  around
[2969.02 --> 2969.92]  your
[2969.92 --> 2971.18]  glorious
[2971.18 --> 2972.26]  throne
[2972.26 --> 2974.18]  They
[2974.18 --> 2975.22]  raise
[2975.22 --> 2975.72]  their
[2975.72 --> 2976.72]  voices
[2976.72 --> 2978.68]  day and
[2978.68 --> 2979.22]  night
[2979.22 --> 2980.86]  in praise
[2980.86 --> 2982.40]  to You
[2982.40 --> 2983.66]  alone
[2983.66 --> 2985.92]  Hallelujah
[2985.92 --> 2991.24]  Glory
[2991.24 --> 2992.92]  be to
[2992.92 --> 2994.06]  our
[2994.06 --> 2994.68]  great
[2994.68 --> 2995.66]  God
[2995.66 --> 2997.70]  Hallelujah
[2997.70 --> 3003.02]  Glory
[3003.02 --> 3004.42]  be to
[3004.42 --> 3005.42]  our
[3005.42 --> 3007.42]  God
[3007.42 --> 3009.56]  Lord
[3009.56 --> 3011.24]  we are
[3011.24 --> 3012.86]  weak and
[3012.86 --> 3015.04]  frail
[3015.04 --> 3017.04]  helpless
[3017.04 --> 3018.80]  in the
[3018.80 --> 3019.92]  storm
[3019.92 --> 3021.96]  surround
[3021.96 --> 3023.32]  us
[3023.32 --> 3024.30]  with
[3024.30 --> 3024.84]  Your
[3024.84 --> 3026.76]  angels
[3026.76 --> 3028.88]  hold
[3028.88 --> 3029.54]  us
[3029.54 --> 3030.42]  in
[3030.42 --> 3031.04]  Your
[3031.04 --> 3032.30]  arms
[3032.30 --> 3034.00]  our
[3034.00 --> 3034.30]  God
[3034.30 --> 3035.64]  will
[3035.64 --> 3036.64]  move
[3036.64 --> 3037.14]  the
[3037.14 --> 3038.04]  enemy
[3038.04 --> 3040.18]  His
[3040.18 --> 3041.50]  pleasure
[3041.50 --> 3042.84]  is
[3042.84 --> 3043.38]  our
[3043.38 --> 3044.20]  heart
[3044.20 --> 3047.46]  rise up
[3047.46 --> 3048.76]  O Lord
[3048.76 --> 3050.32]  and He
[3050.32 --> 3051.68]  will flee
[3051.68 --> 3052.74]  before
[3052.74 --> 3054.18]  our
[3054.18 --> 3055.46]  sovereign
[3055.46 --> 3056.86]  God
[3056.86 --> 3086.26]  Beth
[3086.86 --> 3095.86]  The creature in the sea and every kind of earth
[3096.86 --> 3107.86]  And every mountain, every field and valley of the earth
[3107.86 --> 3119.86]  In all the world has told us to be in all the universe
[3120.86 --> 3133.86]  Sing praises to the living God who rules and blind his word
[3133.86 --> 3146.86]  Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[3147.86 --> 3159.86]  Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[3163.86 --> 3172.86]  So we continue to worship the Lord this morning by giving our tithes and our offerings
[3173.86 --> 3177.86]  And our designated offering this Sunday is for a ministry called One Book
[3178.86 --> 3181.86]  One Book works with national partners in Africa and in Asia
[3182.86 --> 3187.86]  Doing Bible translation, literacy, so people can read, and teaching the Bible
[3187.86 --> 3195.86]  And so you can give online or you can also drop a check off at the church or mail it in
[3196.86 --> 3197.86]  So thank you very much for that
[3197.86 --> 3201.86]  So now please join me in a community prayer
[3201.86 --> 3205.86]  A prayer for our church and our neighbors in the world
[3208.86 --> 3212.86]  Father, we thank you for all of your provision to us
[3212.86 --> 3214.86]  We thank you for our daily bread
[3215.86 --> 3218.86]  And we thank you for each day of our life
[3218.86 --> 3223.86]  So Lord, take our tithes and our offerings and make them bread for the hungry
[3224.86 --> 3227.86]  And life for those trapped in spiritual death
[3228.86 --> 3232.86]  God, you have called us to live as though we belong to you
[3233.86 --> 3235.86]  And you've called us to love you
[3236.86 --> 3238.86]  And to love one another
[3239.86 --> 3241.86]  And so Lord, we ask for your help in both
[3241.86 --> 3244.86]  Lord, in this season of disruption and uncertainty
[3244.86 --> 3250.86]  We ask that you would grow our love for you and for your word
[3251.86 --> 3254.86]  Particularly, we want to listen for your leading
[3255.86 --> 3259.86]  And to have your spirit help us know the way in which we should go
[3260.86 --> 3262.86]  And so we ask, Lord, that you would help us to listen
[3262.86 --> 3269.86]  And to hear you above any and all other voices
[3271.86 --> 3274.86]  We ask that you would grow our trust in your sovereignty
[3275.86 --> 3276.86]  And our trust in your grace
[3277.86 --> 3279.86]  We ask that we would move
[3280.86 --> 3284.86]  That as we move through this sermon series in the book of Acts together
[3285.86 --> 3287.86]  That you would help enliven our imaginations
[3287.86 --> 3290.86]  And our understanding of who you are
[3290.86 --> 3292.86]  And of your work in the world
[3293.86 --> 3296.86]  And who you've called us to be as followers of Jesus
[3297.86 --> 3301.86]  And Lord, we ask that you would help us to love one another well
[3302.86 --> 3303.86]  In the body of Christ
[3304.86 --> 3305.86]  As we seek to be the church
[3306.86 --> 3307.86]  Help us to listen to one another
[3308.86 --> 3309.86]  And to love one another well
[3310.86 --> 3313.86]  Teach us how we are to be generous in our service to one another
[3313.86 --> 3317.86]  Because we are secure in the knowledge that you yourself
[3318.86 --> 3321.86]  Have guaranteed our inheritance in Christ
[3322.86 --> 3326.86]  And so we are free to consider others' interests above our own
[3327.86 --> 3331.86]  Lord, as we lift up the needs of our own congregation
[3332.86 --> 3335.86]  We praise you for the birth of Andrew and Jenny's son, Anson
[3336.86 --> 3337.86]  We thank you for this gift of life
[3338.86 --> 3341.86]  And we ask for your blessing upon this young and growing family
[3341.86 --> 3346.86]  Lord, we ask that you would continue also to heal Andre
[3347.86 --> 3349.86]  We thank you for the good progress that he has made
[3350.86 --> 3352.86]  But Lord, grant him a great recovery
[3353.86 --> 3357.86]  And we pray especially that you would grant him mobility in his legs
[3358.86 --> 3359.86]  Lord, only you can do so
[3360.86 --> 3361.86]  But also be with the doctors
[3362.86 --> 3365.86]  Be with the physical therapists who work with him
[3365.86 --> 3372.86]  And Lord, as we still are sorrowful because of the accident
[3373.86 --> 3374.86]  And Lord, we just ask for your comfort
[3375.86 --> 3377.86]  For family, for Andre himself
[3378.86 --> 3382.86]  And Lord, that we would be around them and would care for them
[3383.86 --> 3385.86]  And Lord, we look ahead to this fall
[3386.86 --> 3388.86]  Where there are so many things still uncertain
[3389.86 --> 3392.86]  Lord, we do ask that you would end this coronavirus quickly
[3392.86 --> 3394.86]  Allow it to burn out
[3395.86 --> 3399.86]  And be with those who are looking for treatments and cures
[3400.86 --> 3403.86]  Speed their work quickly and safely
