• Naaman has leprosy and goes to see the prophet Elisha for a cure
• Naaman, a Syrian general, is healed of leprosy by washing in the Jordan River at Elisha's command.
• Naaman returns to Elisha and offers gifts, but Elisha refuses them.
• Gehazi, Elisha's servant, sees an opportunity to accept gifts from Naaman and lies about his master's instructions to get two talents of silver and clothing.
• When Gehazi returns with the gifts, Elisha knows what has happened and condemns Gehazi for taking the money and items.
• As punishment, Gehazi is afflicted with leprosy.
• Judge Roy Pearson sues dry cleaners for $67 million after they lost his favorite pair of pants.
• The case began with a $10 bill for cleaning and escalated over 10 years, including a trial where Pearson tearfully testified about the mental anguish he suffered.
• Pearson was ultimately forced to pay the defendants' legal fees and lost his appeal for a new term on the bench due to a lack of judicial temperament.
• He then sued the panel that denied him a new term, but this lawsuit was also thrown out of court by a federal judge.

• Gehazi's deception and greed
• The consequences of Gehazi's actions (becoming a leper)
• The question of timing in Gehazi's actions, whether it was truly the right time to receive gifts
• Pagan theology emphasizes that salvation and services from gods require payment
• Naaman is a pagan who brings gifts to Elisha for healing, illustrating the concept of paying for divine service
• The God of Israel is shown to be different in that salvation and favor are free gifts, not something to be bought
• Gehazi's actions and misunderstanding of Elisha's message highlight the importance of recognizing salvation as a gift of grace rather than something earned or paid for
• Naaman's experience is used to illustrate the heart of the gospel: salvation by God's free gift of grace
• The Christian faith emphasizes God's grace and forgiveness through Jesus Christ
• In Christianity, salvation is not earned by good deeds or obedience, but rather received freely as a gift of God's grace
• The focus of the Christian faith is on what has been done for us in Christ, rather than what we must do to earn salvation
• Gehazi's actions in 2 Kings 5 serve as an example of how greed and misrepresentation can distort the true nature of God's character and gifts
• The primary concern should be how our actions reveal or trample on the glory of God's grace, rather than secondary issues like personal sin.
• The importance of reflecting on God's love and service in our actions
• Connection between individual conduct as Christians and God's purpose in the world
• Gehazi's lie as an example of how small actions can have significant effects on God's plan
• The impact of personal choices and behavior on the progress of the gospel
• Examples of ways individuals or communities can block or serve the coming of God's kingdom
• The dangers of making Jesus a "curse word" through our actions and behavior
• The nature of sin: it is not just individual mistakes, but rather a consistent pattern of working against God's purposes
• The contrast between the gospel message and how we often live out our faith in practice
• The free gift of God's grace and healing mercy that comes through Christ's sacrifice, with no price or condition required from us except for faith
• The cost of love: while God's grace is not earned by our actions, it demands a response of surrender and devotion from us
