[252.32 → 257.24] and Pastor Jason will be bringing God's word to us from the book of Acts.
[258.12 → 262.48] Your offerings may be given online or dropped off here at the church.
[263.42 → 265.08] And one special announcement,
[265.56 → 268.64] you will have noticed in the latest issue of Connections
[268.64 → 273.44] that we are going to be returning to church, some of us, next week.
[273.44 → 278.16] Please read page 3 of the Connections' newsletter for all the protocol
[278.16 → 284.70] and be sure to pre-register at the church office this week if you would like to attend.
[285.60 → 286.46] Thank you.
[289.68 → 293.12] Our call to worship comes to us from Psalm 86.
[295.24 → 300.90] There is none like you, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
[300.90 → 307.00] All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord,
[307.00 → 309.28] and shall glorify your name.
[309.84 → 313.30] For you are great and do wondrous things.
[314.24 → 316.32] You alone are God.
[319.28 → 322.18] God greets us with these words from 2 Peter.
[323.52 → 326.82] May grace and peace be yours in abundance
[326.82 → 330.74] in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[331.40 → 331.80] Amen.
[337.00 → 340.26] Amen.
[340.26 → 341.12] You alone are God.
[341.12 → 345.42] Yes, you alone are your love.
[345.58 → 350.18] Is the light of my soul,
[350.54 → 353.04] O my soul,
[353.52 → 357.10] Wishing this lonely day.
[358.14 → 361.10] Sing like never before,
[361.94 → 364.16] O my soul,
[364.16 → 369.16] I'll worship your holy name.
[372.46 → 378.42] The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[378.42 → 383.74] It's time to sing your song again.
[384.12 → 390.02] Whatever may pass, cannot turn the lights before me.
[390.02 → 397.00] And may be sharing my daily time.
[400.36 → 406.12] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul.
[406.82 → 410.42] Worship your holy name.
[410.42 → 416.80] Sing my glory before, O my soul.
[416.80 → 421.62] I'll worship your holy name.
[425.22 → 430.78] The great in the love, and your soul to the name.
[431.52 → 435.80] Your name is gracious, and your heart is kind.
[435.80 → 442.22] I am goodness, I will keep on singing.
[442.22 → 444.22] I will keep on singing.
[444.22 → 449.22] Ten thousand reasons for my life to find.
[449.22 → 451.22] Thank you.
[451.22 → 452.22] Thank you.
[452.22 → 458.42] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul.
[459.12 → 463.22] Worship your holy name.
[463.22 → 469.22] Sing my glory before, O my soul.
[469.22 → 474.08] I'll worship your holy name.
[477.68 → 483.38] And on that day when my strength is failing,
[484.32 → 488.22] the end crossed in and my time has come,
[489.38 → 495.06] still my soul is singing as you fall and keep.
[495.06 → 501.80] And in the last of my life I'll be forever alone.
[505.00 → 510.66] It's the Lord of my soul, of my soul,
[511.38 → 513.72] worship is holy.
[515.64 → 521.30] Soon I'll never be born, of my soul,
[521.30 → 524.56] I'll worship and hold me.
[525.06 → 530.52] I'll worship and hold me.
[532.62 → 536.20] I'll worship and hold me.
[536.20 → 541.66] I'll worship and hold me.
[541.66 → 547.12] I'll worship and hold me.
[547.12 → 552.58] I'll worship and hold me.
[552.58 → 554.68] I'll worship and hold me.
[554.68 → 560.14] I'll worship and hold me.
[560.14 → 562.14] I'll worship and hold me.
[562.14 → 563.82] I'll worship and hold me.
[563.82 → 569.28] I'll worship and hold me.
[569.28 → 571.28] I'll worship and hold me.
[571.28 → 576.74] I'll worship and hold me.
[576.74 → 578.74] I'll worship and hold me.
[578.74 → 580.74] I'll worship and hold me.
[580.74 → 586.20] I'll worship and hold me.
[586.20 → 588.20] I'll worship and hold me.
[588.20 → 593.66] I'll worship and hold me.
[593.66 → 595.66] I'll worship and hold me.
[595.66 → 601.12] I'll worship and hold me.
[601.12 → 603.12] I'll worship and hold me.
[603.12 → 610.58] I'll worship and hold me.
[610.58 → 618.58] I will worship and hold me.
[618.64 → 619.04] I'll worship and hold me.
[619.04 → 619.94] I'll worship and hold me.
[619.94 → 624.76] You will let the living day, you will not forsake.
[625.32 → 630.86] You will cheer me on with brother and big praise.
[631.62 → 636.60] Sing, Revenge, all I know, my God is for us.
[637.00 → 641.38] The Father's love is the strong and mighty fortress.
[641.82 → 646.28] Raise your voice now, our love is greater.
[646.28 → 652.18] We're standing against us, if my God is for us.
[660.52 → 666.36] In the light, no doubt, we separate us.
[666.36 → 671.18] We lift, no one defeat us.
[671.46 → 675.98] He who made his son to free us.
[676.28 → 680.02] Close in his love.
[680.02 → 685.36] We are high and mortal, and separate us.
[685.62 → 690.10] Hell and death, no one defeat us.
[690.34 → 694.76] He who gave his son to free us.
[695.18 → 698.66] Close in his love.
[698.66 → 707.20] Sing, Revenge, all I know, my God is for us.
[707.20 → 712.08] The Father's love is the strong and mighty fortress.
[712.40 → 716.98] Raise your voice now, our love is redress.
[717.40 → 722.32] You can stand up against us, our God is for us.
[722.32 → 726.92] Raise your voice now, our God is for us.
[726.92 → 731.54] The Father's love is the strong and mighty fortress.
[731.54 → 736.36] Raise your voice now, our love is great.
[736.36 → 742.46] You can stand up against us, if our God is for us.
[742.46 → 756.28] You can stand up against us, our God is for us.
[756.28 → 761.68] You can stand up against us, our love is for us.
[761.68 → 775.42] You can stand up against us, our love is for us.
[775.42 → 790.42] Thank you.
[790.60 → 800.90] Oh, what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
[800.90 → 809.66] All the peace we all can hold that
[809.66 → 815.32] All the ministry we bear
[815.32 → 822.16] All it does lead to the glory
[822.16 → 828.66] Everything to my own prayer
[828.66 → 837.00] Help me to ask the temptations
[837.00 → 841.78] Is there trouble anywhere?
[844.30 → 849.28] We shall never be discouraged
[849.28 → 855.76] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[855.76 → 862.44] And we find a place so faithful
[862.44 → 869.10] And we're all our sorrows share
[869.10 → 874.10] Jesus, let our every weakness
[874.10 → 882.44] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[882.44 → 890.52] Are we weak and let me lay down
[890.52 → 896.78] Comfort with the love of God
[896.78 → 903.46] We shall save you, let our every weakness
[903.46 → 909.60] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[909.60 → 917.46] Do your precious blood for save you
[917.46 → 923.80] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[923.80 → 929.38] In this heart you take that shield
[929.38 → 936.38] You will find us almost there
[936.38 → 952.66] In our time of confession today
[952.66 → 955.26] There will be opportunity for silent prayer
[955.26 → 960.50] How often have we heard the good news
[960.50 → 962.64] Of forgiveness and restoration
[962.64 → 966.96] Yet we are still reluctant to believe and to follow
[966.96 → 969.90] God offers us new life
[969.90 → 973.22] Yet we are afraid to let go of the old
[973.22 → 976.18] Let us confess our doubts and fears
[976.18 → 978.82] To the one who waits to make us whole
[978.82 → 984.62] Forgive us, Lord, for treating your sacrifice
[984.62 → 987.80] As something small and insignificant
[987.80 → 990.10] You were without sin
[990.10 → 994.36] And yet you were forsaken, condemned, and put to death
[994.36 → 996.80] You took on our sins
[996.80 → 999.46] So that we may have life abundantly
[999.46 → 1002.80] We use a lot of words, gracious God
[1002.80 → 1005.30] But do little to turn them into deeds
[1005.30 → 1008.74] Instead of being of one heart and soul
[1008.74 → 1011.46] We choose sides and form groups of folks
[1011.46 → 1012.94] Just like us
[1012.94 → 1015.56] Blessed with great grace
[1015.56 → 1017.30] We have trouble sharing it
[1017.30 → 1019.42] With those who need it the most
[1019.42 → 1023.52] Forgive us, God of love
[1023.52 → 1024.68] Forgive us
[1024.68 → 1027.14] As we step out of our shadows
[1027.14 → 1028.56] Into your light
[1028.56 → 1030.12] Restore us
[1030.12 → 1032.16] As we reveal our brokenness
[1032.16 → 1033.34] Hear us
[1033.34 → 1035.86] As we proclaim Jesus Christ
[1035.86 → 1038.08] As our Lord and our God
[1038.08 → 1040.58] Hear us now
[1040.58 → 1042.36] As we confess our sins
[1042.36 → 1043.44] Our doubts
[1043.44 → 1044.98] And our fears
[1044.98 → 1046.86] Please pray silently
[1058.56 → 1072.48] This is the good news we declare
[1072.48 → 1075.76] God leads us out of the shadows
[1075.76 → 1077.62] To walk in the light of Christ
[1077.62 → 1079.32] Christ is King
[1079.32 → 1080.74] He is our Saviour
[1080.74 → 1082.16] And our Shepherd
[1082.16 → 1085.46] This is the word we have heard
[1085.46 → 1086.86] Our faithful God
[1086.86 → 1088.22] Our faithful God forgives our sins
[1088.22 → 1090.82] And raises us to new life
[1090.82 → 1092.60] Thanks be to God
[1092.60 → 1093.78] Amen
[1093.78 → 1097.04] Let's sing of our gratitude
[1097.04 → 1099.04] For this amazing love
[1099.04 → 1116.50] I'm forgiven
[1116.50 → 1120.06] As you were forsaken
[1120.06 → 1123.10] I'm accepted
[1123.10 → 1127.40] You were condemned
[1127.40 → 1130.74] I'm alive and well
[1130.74 → 1134.20] The Spirit is within me
[1134.20 → 1139.52] As you die and rose again
[1139.52 → 1144.12] Amazing love
[1144.12 → 1147.34] How can it be
[1147.34 → 1149.76] That you my King
[1149.76 → 1151.96] Would die for free
[1151.96 → 1156.92] Amazing love
[1156.92 → 1159.74] I know it's true
[1159.74 → 1164.52] It's my joy to honour you
[1164.52 → 1167.76] All I do
[1167.76 → 1171.76] I honour you
[1171.76 → 1178.42] I'm forgiven
[1178.42 → 1181.68] I still work for Satan
[1181.68 → 1184.82] I'm accepted
[1184.82 → 1188.26] You were condemned
[1188.26 → 1192.20] I'm alive and well
[1192.20 → 1193.96] You're still in the tears
[1193.96 → 1195.60] Within me
[1195.60 → 1199.20] Because you die and rose again
[1199.20 → 1201.20] I'm frozen again
[1201.20 → 1205.20] Amazing love
[1205.20 → 1209.04] How long can it be
[1209.04 → 1211.02] To be my name
[1211.02 → 1212.52] For life only
[1212.52 → 1217.20] Amazing love
[1217.20 → 1220.20] I know it's true
[1220.20 → 1225.60] It's my joy to honour you
[1225.60 → 1228.20] In all I do
[1228.20 → 1232.20] I honour you
[1232.20 → 1238.20] You are my King
[1238.20 → 1241.20] You are my King
[1241.20 → 1246.20] Jesus you are my King
[1246.20 → 1252.20] Jesus you are my King
[1252.20 → 1259.20] Jesus you are my King
[1259.20 → 1260.20] Jesus you are my King
[1260.20 → 1262.20] Things in love
[1262.20 → 1265.20] How can it be
[1265.20 → 1268.20] But you my King
[1268.20 → 1272.20] Will die for me
[1272.20 → 1274.20] Amazing love
[1274.20 → 1278.20] I'm going to see you
[1278.20 → 1279.20] I'm going to see you
[1279.20 → 1282.20] It's my joy to honour you
[1282.20 → 1286.20] In all I do
[1286.20 → 1289.94] I honour you
