[287.54 --> 291.54]  Good morning and welcome to this worship service.
[291.54 --> 305.54]  All you who are close by and far away may we be blessed as we listen to God's word, as we sing praises to his name, and so that his name may be praised and glorified.
[305.54 --> 313.54]  Before we continue with our worship service, I have one announcement to be made, and that is a sad note.
[313.54 --> 320.54]  This last Thursday, our brother in the Lord, Bill Van Dob, passed away.
[320.54 --> 330.54]  He is now with his Lord and his Savior, and we praise again our God after a long time of suffering that he's with him.
[330.54 --> 339.54]  This morning we also welcome again Reverend Pastor Chaplain Gary Rosma, Chaplain of the Ministry of Seafarers.
[339.54 --> 349.54]  I'm very happy and honored to introduce him, and he will bring and open up God's word, and he will speak again about the prophet Elisha.
[349.54 --> 359.54]  And the next week our pastor Jason will be back and will continue preaching on the series on the book of Acts.
[359.54 --> 366.54]  And so let us now have a moment of silent prayer and come before the Lord our God.
[366.54 --> 379.54]  The psalmist says this morning that the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord.
[379.54 --> 385.54]  The heavens are yours, and yours also is the earth.
[385.54 --> 389.54]  You founded the world and all that is in it.
[389.54 --> 394.54]  Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne.
[394.54 --> 397.54]  Love and faithfulness go before you.
[397.54 --> 405.54]  Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence.
[405.54 --> 411.92]  O Lord, they rejoice in your name all day long.
[412.84 --> 415.68]  They exult in your righteousness.
[418.18 --> 419.54]  God will greet us now.
[420.32 --> 426.06]  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[427.04 --> 427.38]  Amen.
[428.56 --> 433.80]  We will have now a time of praise, singing, and please join the worship team.
[433.80 --> 436.74]  And also thank you, worship team, for joining us this morning.
[437.70 --> 439.36]  May the Lord bless us as we continue.
[463.80 --> 475.94]  Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[476.54 --> 482.74]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[482.74 --> 492.08]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[492.66 --> 493.40]  Come.
[496.04 --> 499.74]  One day every tongue will confess you are God.
[500.54 --> 502.74]  One day every knee will bow.
[502.74 --> 512.74]  Come, still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[514.74 --> 521.06]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[521.06 --> 530.06]  Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[531.06 --> 537.40]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[539.40 --> 546.22]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[546.22 --> 576.20]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[576.20 --> 578.20]  Come.
[578.20 --> 579.20]  Come.
[579.20 --> 585.20]  Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[585.20 --> 592.46]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[592.46 --> 601.20]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[601.20 --> 603.20]  Come.
[603.20 --> 622.20]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[622.20 --> 641.20]  Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee
[641.20 --> 660.20]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[660.20 --> 679.20]  Holy, holy, holy Though the darkness hide Thee Though the eye may blind by sin My glory may not see
[679.20 --> 697.82]  Only Thou art holy There is none beside Thee Perfect, empowering Love and purity
[697.82 --> 718.82]  Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty All Thy works shall praise Thy name In earth and sky and sea
[718.82 --> 738.82]  Holy, holy, holy Holy, holy, merciful and mighty God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[748.82 --> 758.82]  This morning we are introducing to you a new song called God is for us I believe it's based off the verses in Romans 8 which I will read to you
[758.82 --> 766.90]  If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all
[766.90 --> 771.56]  How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?
[771.56 --> 779.36]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life Neither angels nor demons Neither the present nor the future
[779.36 --> 785.10]  Nor any powers Neither height nor depth Nor anything else in all creation
[785.10 --> 790.90]  Will be able to separate us from the love of God That is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[790.90 --> 792.04]  Let's sing
[801.56 --> 803.32]  We won't sing
[803.32 --> 812.90]  We won't feel the battle We won't feel the night We will walk the valley With you by our side
[812.90 --> 824.74]  You will go before us You will lead the way We have found a refuge Only you can save
[824.74 --> 829.76]  Sing we joy now, our God is for us.
[830.14 --> 834.36]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[834.90 --> 839.62]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[839.62 --> 845.66]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[849.46 --> 854.66]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall,
[855.10 --> 859.50]  Even when I turn back, still your love is sure.
[860.14 --> 864.58]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake.
[864.58 --> 870.76]  You will cheer me onward with never-ending grace.
[871.40 --> 876.46]  Sing we joy now, our God is for us.
[876.84 --> 881.02]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[881.02 --> 886.16]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[886.58 --> 891.86]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[891.86 --> 905.98]  Neither heart nor depth can separate us.
[906.06 --> 910.72]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[910.72 --> 915.42]  He who gave his Son to free us.
[915.42 --> 919.34]  Holds me in his love.
[919.34 --> 925.14]  Neither heart nor depth can separate us.
[925.14 --> 930.06]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[930.06 --> 934.80]  He who gave his Son to free us.
[934.80 --> 939.84]  Holds me in his love.
[941.84 --> 947.40]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[947.76 --> 951.98]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[952.52 --> 957.10]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[957.10 --> 962.26]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[962.26 --> 967.46]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[967.84 --> 971.96]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[972.50 --> 977.04]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[977.46 --> 983.14]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[983.14 --> 990.80]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[990.80 --> 1007.90]  As we enter the time of confession and assurance,
[1008.74 --> 1009.96]  the time of grace,
[1009.96 --> 1012.82]  we always have to be reminded that the gospel is good news
[1012.82 --> 1013.82]  because of grace,
[1014.52 --> 1015.84]  because of what Christ has done,
[1016.08 --> 1017.78]  what God has done through Jesus Christ rather,
[1018.52 --> 1021.38]  so that we may live now and for eternity.
[1022.46 --> 1025.40]  And so one well-known part of scripture
[1025.40 --> 1027.56]  written by the Apostle Paul is of course,
[1028.16 --> 1029.00]  as most of you know,
[1029.10 --> 1030.84]  is from Ephesians chapter 2.
[1031.70 --> 1033.82]  But it's always good to read it again
[1033.82 --> 1036.52]  and to be reminded again of that grace
[1036.52 --> 1039.88]  we have by faith in Jesus Christ.
[1043.06 --> 1044.14]  As for you,
[1045.64 --> 1048.18]  you were dead in your transgressions and sins
[1048.18 --> 1050.64]  in which you used to live
[1050.64 --> 1052.84]  when you followed the ways of this world
[1052.84 --> 1055.74]  and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air,
[1055.74 --> 1058.34]  the spirit who is now at work
[1058.34 --> 1059.82]  and those who are disobedient.
[1061.20 --> 1066.04]  All of us also lived among them at one time,
[1067.28 --> 1069.92]  gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature
[1069.92 --> 1073.08]  and following its desires and thoughts.
[1074.08 --> 1074.82]  Like the rest,
[1075.30 --> 1078.92]  we were by nature objects of wrath.
[1078.92 --> 1083.36]  But because of his great love for us,
[1083.46 --> 1085.36]  God, who is rich in mercy,
[1086.58 --> 1087.94]  made us alive with Christ
[1087.94 --> 1090.98]  even when we were dead in transgressions.
[1092.16 --> 1093.96]  It is by grace you have been saved.
[1095.18 --> 1097.04]  And God raised us up with Christ
[1097.04 --> 1099.54]  and seated us with him in the heavenly realms
[1099.54 --> 1101.12]  in Christ Jesus,
[1101.70 --> 1103.80]  in order that in the coming ages
[1103.80 --> 1107.44]  he might show the incomparable riches of his grace,
[1107.44 --> 1112.88]  expressed in his kindness to us in Jesus Christ.
[1114.16 --> 1116.38]  For it is by grace you have been saved,
[1116.78 --> 1117.54]  through faith,
[1118.20 --> 1120.44]  and this not from yourselves.
[1121.22 --> 1123.26]  It is the gift of God,
[1124.06 --> 1126.70]  not by works so that no one can boast.
[1127.70 --> 1129.12]  For we are God's workmanship,
[1129.78 --> 1132.94]  created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[1132.94 --> 1137.66]  which God prepared in advance for us to do.
[1138.54 --> 1141.22]  Our hymn of response is then, of course,
[1142.12 --> 1143.26]  Amazing Grace,
[1143.34 --> 1144.26]  How Sweet a Sound,
[1144.72 --> 1146.14]  That Saved a Wretch Like Me.
[1146.30 --> 1148.82]  And we will have a duet,
[1149.82 --> 1150.66]  Haley and Sarah,
[1150.90 --> 1153.14]  and you will sing that beautiful hymn for us.
[1153.66 --> 1156.56]  And please join them as you are at home,
[1157.04 --> 1157.90]  Amazing Grace,
[1158.08 --> 1158.98]  How Sweet that Sound.
[1158.98 --> 1178.42]  Amazing Grace,
[1178.42 --> 1184.36]  How Sweet the Sound,
[1184.36 --> 1191.24]  That Saved a Wretch Like Me.
[1191.24 --> 1195.58]  For our hearts are slow,
[1196.04 --> 1199.24]  But now I know,
[1199.80 --> 1201.42]  As blind,
[1201.42 --> 1205.42]  But now I see,
[1206.34 --> 1210.30]  T'was grace that taught
[1210.30 --> 1214.18]  My heart to fear,
[1214.18 --> 1220.54]  And grace my view relieved,
[1220.54 --> 1224.64]  How precious did
[1224.64 --> 1228.18]  The grace of you,
[1228.18 --> 1233.36]  The hour I've just begun,
[1233.36 --> 1236.24]  Amazing Grace,
[1236.24 --> 1237.24]  And we've been there,
[1237.24 --> 1240.24]  A thousand years,
[1240.24 --> 1245.24]  Fresh are ye as the sun,
[1245.24 --> 1249.62]  We've known as grace,
[1249.62 --> 1253.64]  To sing God's praise,
[1253.64 --> 1259.18]  And when we first begun,
[1259.18 --> 1263.06]  Amazing Grace,
[1263.06 --> 1267.06]  How Sweet the Sound,
[1267.06 --> 1268.06]  How Sweet the Sound,
[1268.06 --> 1275.06]  That Saved a Wretch Like Me.
[1275.06 --> 1280.14]  I once was lost,
[1280.14 --> 1283.94]  But now I'm found,
[1283.94 --> 1285.94]  Was blind,
[1286.74 --> 1290.44]  But now I see,
[1290.44 --> 1305.52]  Well, thank you for leading us
[1305.52 --> 1307.90]  so beautifully
[1307.90 --> 1310.00]  in that beautiful
[1310.00 --> 1312.42]  and treasured hymn.
[1313.42 --> 1314.80]  And now I'd invite you
[1314.80 --> 1316.38]  to turn in your Bibles
[1316.38 --> 1319.54]  again to 2nd Kings chapter 2.
[1320.16 --> 1323.00]  We'll reread the first 14 verses
[1323.00 --> 1326.38]  and then read on through verse 18.
[1327.00 --> 1330.62]  Again, the story of Elijah and Elisha.
[1331.76 --> 1333.42]  2nd Kings chapter 2,
[1333.48 --> 1334.44]  beginning at verse 1.
[1334.72 --> 1335.94]  Let's bow in a word of prayer
[1335.94 --> 1337.34]  before we read God's word.
[1340.72 --> 1342.62]  Open our eyes, Lord,
[1342.62 --> 1345.06]  that we may behold
[1345.06 --> 1346.30]  the wonders
[1346.30 --> 1348.30]  of your word.
[1350.48 --> 1351.60]  Through the presence
[1351.60 --> 1353.66]  of the Spirit of Jesus in us,
[1353.72 --> 1354.10]  we pray.
[1354.78 --> 1355.26]  Amen.
[1357.74 --> 1360.20]  2nd Kings chapter 1.
[1363.92 --> 1365.28]  When the Lord was about
[1365.28 --> 1367.30]  to take Elijah up to heaven
[1367.30 --> 1368.36]  in a whirlwind,
[1368.84 --> 1370.26]  Elijah and Elisha
[1370.26 --> 1371.22]  were on their way
[1371.22 --> 1372.06]  from Gilgal.
[1373.14 --> 1374.88]  Elijah said to Elisha,
[1375.36 --> 1376.02]  Stay here.
[1376.36 --> 1377.42]  The Lord has sent me
[1377.42 --> 1377.98]  to Bethel.
[1378.78 --> 1379.86]  But Elisha said,
[1380.16 --> 1381.56]  As surely as the Lord lives
[1381.56 --> 1382.18]  and as you live,
[1382.22 --> 1383.14]  I will not leave you.
[1383.72 --> 1384.72]  So they went down
[1384.72 --> 1385.24]  to Bethel.
[1386.08 --> 1387.44]  The company of the prophets
[1387.44 --> 1389.16]  at Bethel came out
[1389.16 --> 1390.84]  to Elisha and asked,
[1391.18 --> 1392.22]  Do you know that the Lord
[1392.22 --> 1393.48]  is going to take your master
[1393.48 --> 1394.48]  from you today?
[1395.44 --> 1396.48]  Yes, I know,
[1396.92 --> 1397.70]  Elisha replied,
[1397.86 --> 1398.74]  so be quiet.
[1398.74 --> 1402.72]  Then Elijah said to him,
[1402.94 --> 1403.42]  Stay here,
[1403.52 --> 1403.98]  Elisha.
[1404.32 --> 1405.64]  The Lord has sent me
[1405.64 --> 1406.40]  to Jericho.
[1407.30 --> 1408.26]  And he replied,
[1408.38 --> 1409.74]  As surely as the Lord lives
[1409.74 --> 1410.46]  and as you live,
[1410.56 --> 1411.54]  I will not leave you.
[1412.10 --> 1413.48]  So they went to Jericho.
[1414.30 --> 1415.60]  The company of the prophets
[1415.60 --> 1416.38]  at Jericho
[1416.38 --> 1417.68]  went up to Elisha
[1417.68 --> 1418.40]  and asked him,
[1418.68 --> 1419.86]  Do you know that the Lord
[1419.86 --> 1421.10]  is going to take your master
[1421.10 --> 1422.08]  from you today?
[1423.08 --> 1423.90]  Yes, I know,
[1423.98 --> 1424.46]  he replied,
[1424.58 --> 1425.52]  so be quiet.
[1425.52 --> 1429.12]  Then Elijah said to him,
[1429.48 --> 1430.08]  Stay here,
[1430.50 --> 1431.56]  the Lord has sent me
[1431.56 --> 1432.28]  to the Jordan.
[1433.16 --> 1433.88]  And he replied,
[1434.00 --> 1435.20]  As surely as the Lord lives
[1435.20 --> 1435.82]  and as you live,
[1435.94 --> 1437.14]  I will not leave you.
[1437.56 --> 1438.42]  So the two of them
[1438.42 --> 1439.06]  walked on.
[1440.06 --> 1441.38]  Fifty men from the company
[1441.38 --> 1442.02]  of the prophets
[1442.02 --> 1442.86]  went and stood
[1442.86 --> 1443.58]  at a distance,
[1443.74 --> 1444.62]  facing the place
[1444.62 --> 1446.22]  where Elijah and Elisha
[1446.22 --> 1447.02]  had stopped
[1447.02 --> 1447.80]  at the Jordan.
[1448.88 --> 1450.38]  Elijah took his cloak,
[1450.92 --> 1451.58]  rolled it up,
[1451.74 --> 1452.86]  and struck the water
[1452.86 --> 1453.28]  with it.
[1453.28 --> 1454.84]  The water divided
[1454.84 --> 1455.48]  to the right
[1455.48 --> 1456.28]  and to the left,
[1456.52 --> 1457.16]  and the two of them
[1457.16 --> 1457.92]  crossed over
[1457.92 --> 1459.02]  on dry ground.
[1460.26 --> 1461.44]  When they had crossed,
[1461.72 --> 1462.86]  Elijah said to Elisha,
[1462.96 --> 1463.30]  Tell me,
[1463.38 --> 1464.36]  what can I do for you
[1464.36 --> 1465.84]  before I am taken from you?
[1467.12 --> 1468.18]  Let me inherit
[1468.18 --> 1469.42]  a double portion
[1469.42 --> 1470.70]  of your spirit,
[1471.04 --> 1471.90]  Elisha replied.
[1472.92 --> 1473.80]  You have asked
[1473.80 --> 1474.86]  a difficult thing,
[1475.10 --> 1475.80]  Elijah said.
[1476.18 --> 1477.34]  Yet if you see me
[1477.34 --> 1478.64]  when I am taken from you,
[1478.82 --> 1479.98]  it will be yours.
[1480.48 --> 1480.90]  Otherwise,
[1481.32 --> 1482.18]  it will not.
[1482.18 --> 1485.14]  As they were walking along
[1485.14 --> 1486.18]  and talking together,
[1486.62 --> 1488.54]  suddenly a chariot of fire
[1488.54 --> 1489.74]  and horses of fire
[1489.74 --> 1490.16]  appeared
[1490.16 --> 1491.42]  and separated
[1491.42 --> 1492.42]  the two of them,
[1492.68 --> 1493.96]  and Elijah went up
[1493.96 --> 1494.40]  to heaven
[1494.40 --> 1495.26]  in a whirlwind.
[1496.36 --> 1497.68]  Elisha saw this
[1497.68 --> 1498.58]  and cried out,
[1498.68 --> 1499.38]  My father,
[1499.50 --> 1500.26]  my father,
[1500.82 --> 1501.56]  the chariots
[1501.56 --> 1502.30]  and horsemen
[1502.30 --> 1502.86]  of Israel.
[1503.70 --> 1504.78]  And Elisha
[1504.78 --> 1505.74]  saw him no more.
[1506.94 --> 1508.30]  Then he took hold
[1508.30 --> 1508.96]  of his garment
[1508.96 --> 1510.66]  and tore it in two.
[1510.66 --> 1514.42]  Elisha then picked up
[1514.42 --> 1515.94]  Elijah's cloak
[1515.94 --> 1517.16]  that had fallen
[1517.16 --> 1517.72]  from him
[1517.72 --> 1519.06]  and went back
[1519.06 --> 1520.24]  and stood on the bank
[1520.24 --> 1520.96]  of the Jordan.
[1521.62 --> 1522.48]  He took the cloak
[1522.48 --> 1523.24]  that had fallen
[1523.24 --> 1523.98]  from Elijah
[1523.98 --> 1525.30]  and struck the water
[1525.30 --> 1525.78]  with it.
[1526.32 --> 1527.52]  Where now is the Lord,
[1527.62 --> 1528.74]  the God of Elijah?
[1529.08 --> 1529.70]  He asked.
[1530.22 --> 1531.12]  When he struck
[1531.12 --> 1531.70]  the water,
[1532.22 --> 1532.96]  it divided
[1532.96 --> 1533.92]  to the right
[1533.92 --> 1535.16]  and to the left
[1535.16 --> 1536.70]  and he crossed over.
[1537.62 --> 1538.98]  The company of the prophets
[1538.98 --> 1539.80]  from Jericho
[1539.80 --> 1540.50]  who were watching
[1540.50 --> 1540.92]  said,
[1541.48 --> 1542.88]  The spirit of Elijah
[1542.88 --> 1543.86]  is resting
[1543.86 --> 1545.22]  on Elisha.
[1546.04 --> 1547.02]  And they went
[1547.02 --> 1547.90]  to meet him
[1547.90 --> 1548.82]  and bowed
[1548.82 --> 1549.58]  to the ground
[1549.58 --> 1550.36]  before him.
[1551.08 --> 1551.88]  Look, they said,
[1551.98 --> 1552.72]  we your servants
[1552.72 --> 1554.24]  have fifty able men.
[1554.62 --> 1555.16]  Let them go
[1555.16 --> 1556.26]  and look for your master.
[1556.44 --> 1557.46]  Perhaps the spirit
[1557.46 --> 1557.92]  of the Lord
[1557.92 --> 1558.74]  has picked him up
[1558.74 --> 1560.16]  and set him down
[1560.16 --> 1560.98]  on some mountain
[1560.98 --> 1561.94]  or in some valley.
[1561.94 --> 1564.08]  No, Elisha replied,
[1564.30 --> 1565.30]  do not send them.
[1566.08 --> 1567.48]  But they persisted
[1567.48 --> 1568.16]  until he was
[1568.16 --> 1569.12]  too embarrassed
[1569.12 --> 1569.76]  to refuse.
[1570.46 --> 1571.26]  So he said,
[1571.36 --> 1571.82]  send them.
[1572.60 --> 1573.18]  And they sent
[1573.18 --> 1573.82]  fifty men
[1573.82 --> 1574.40]  who searched
[1574.40 --> 1575.52]  for three days
[1575.52 --> 1576.88]  but did not find him.
[1577.64 --> 1578.52]  When they returned
[1578.52 --> 1579.26]  to Elisha
[1579.26 --> 1580.04]  who was staying
[1580.04 --> 1580.74]  in Jericho,
[1581.04 --> 1581.72]  he said to them,
[1582.34 --> 1583.58]  Didn't I tell you
[1583.58 --> 1584.80]  not to go?
[1584.80 --> 1590.26]  Some of you,
[1590.44 --> 1591.58]  probably many of you,
[1591.74 --> 1592.50]  have seen
[1592.50 --> 1593.54]  and may recall
[1593.54 --> 1597.10]  the image
[1597.10 --> 1598.26]  of that story
[1598.26 --> 1599.06]  or you've read it
[1599.06 --> 1599.62]  in the books
[1599.62 --> 1600.70]  in the Lord of the Rings.
[1601.16 --> 1601.66]  You'll remember
[1601.66 --> 1603.04]  from the Fellowship
[1603.04 --> 1603.64]  of the Ring
[1603.64 --> 1606.26]  earlier on
[1606.26 --> 1608.00]  in the whole long
[1608.00 --> 1608.82]  narrative
[1608.82 --> 1610.68]  when they are
[1610.68 --> 1612.04]  this hodgepodge
[1612.04 --> 1614.26]  group of people
[1614.26 --> 1617.14]  mix of men
[1617.14 --> 1618.76]  and dwarves
[1618.76 --> 1619.70]  and elves
[1619.70 --> 1620.94]  and hobbits
[1620.94 --> 1622.60]  and of course
[1622.60 --> 1623.48]  Gandalf,
[1623.72 --> 1624.30]  the wizard.
[1625.68 --> 1626.70]  And Gandalf
[1626.70 --> 1627.80]  is with them
[1627.80 --> 1628.70]  and he is
[1628.70 --> 1629.60]  sort of the
[1629.60 --> 1631.04]  de facto leader
[1631.04 --> 1632.46]  of this band.
[1633.52 --> 1634.64]  Well it comes
[1634.64 --> 1635.32]  to this point
[1635.32 --> 1635.88]  when they are
[1635.88 --> 1637.88]  in the mines
[1637.88 --> 1638.58]  of Moria
[1638.58 --> 1640.80]  and they meet
[1640.80 --> 1643.34]  the terrifyingly
[1643.34 --> 1644.08]  powerful
[1644.08 --> 1645.12]  Balrog.
[1646.16 --> 1647.18]  And this is
[1647.18 --> 1648.74]  a fierce beast.
[1649.76 --> 1650.62]  Even Gandalf
[1650.62 --> 1651.34]  is frightened.
[1652.34 --> 1653.58]  And they run
[1653.58 --> 1654.82]  and then Gandalf
[1654.82 --> 1656.20]  stands his ground
[1656.20 --> 1657.34]  and battles,
[1657.48 --> 1658.44]  does this battle
[1658.44 --> 1659.52]  with the Balrog
[1659.52 --> 1660.74]  and finally
[1660.74 --> 1661.46]  the Balrog
[1661.46 --> 1663.14]  is cast down
[1663.14 --> 1664.26]  into the abyss.
[1665.02 --> 1666.02]  But just as
[1666.02 --> 1666.98]  he's going down
[1666.98 --> 1669.12]  he grabs on
[1669.12 --> 1670.00]  to Gandalf
[1670.00 --> 1671.34]  and drags
[1671.34 --> 1671.94]  Gandalf
[1671.94 --> 1672.66]  with him.
[1674.98 --> 1675.62]  Oh.
[1677.12 --> 1678.52]  The rest of the group
[1678.52 --> 1680.90]  run out of the mines
[1680.90 --> 1682.56]  and into the open air
[1682.56 --> 1683.70]  but they are
[1683.70 --> 1685.16]  in despair
[1685.16 --> 1686.56]  because
[1686.56 --> 1688.32]  their real leader
[1688.32 --> 1689.94]  is gone.
[1691.54 --> 1693.18]  How can they go on?
[1694.22 --> 1695.50]  And yet they must.
[1695.50 --> 1698.36]  Now that kind
[1698.36 --> 1699.32]  of emotion
[1699.32 --> 1701.06]  is somewhat
[1701.06 --> 1702.16]  I think in some ways
[1702.16 --> 1702.56]  similar
[1702.56 --> 1703.96]  to what's going on
[1703.96 --> 1704.72]  in this story.
[1705.22 --> 1706.68]  You have to recognize
[1706.68 --> 1707.68]  Elijah
[1707.68 --> 1708.66]  is
[1708.66 --> 1710.24]  the prophet
[1710.24 --> 1710.92]  of the Lord.
[1711.16 --> 1711.88]  There are lots
[1711.88 --> 1712.80]  of other prophets
[1712.80 --> 1714.84]  but Elijah
[1714.84 --> 1716.44]  is the real
[1716.44 --> 1718.36]  anointed
[1718.36 --> 1719.38]  prophet
[1719.38 --> 1720.06]  of the Lord.
[1720.06 --> 1722.44]  and then
[1722.44 --> 1723.40]  he's gone.
[1724.60 --> 1725.42]  Who can
[1725.42 --> 1726.18]  possibly
[1726.18 --> 1727.04]  replace
[1727.04 --> 1728.52]  Elijah?
[1730.28 --> 1731.08]  That's the
[1731.08 --> 1731.68]  question.
[1735.16 --> 1736.02]  And so
[1736.02 --> 1736.58]  as we saw
[1736.58 --> 1737.18]  last week
[1737.18 --> 1737.88]  they're on this
[1737.88 --> 1738.58]  journey
[1738.58 --> 1739.76]  towards
[1739.76 --> 1741.18]  the Jordan
[1741.18 --> 1741.76]  Jericho
[1741.76 --> 1742.52]  and the Jordan
[1742.52 --> 1743.30]  and beyond
[1743.30 --> 1743.90]  to where
[1743.90 --> 1744.52]  Elijah
[1744.52 --> 1745.54]  is taken up
[1745.54 --> 1746.32]  into heaven
[1746.32 --> 1747.82]  and
[1747.82 --> 1749.92]  Elijah
[1749.92 --> 1750.44]  again
[1750.44 --> 1750.88]  is that
[1750.88 --> 1751.82]  great figure
[1751.82 --> 1752.78]  against
[1752.78 --> 1753.48]  much
[1753.48 --> 1754.10]  royal
[1754.10 --> 1754.78]  and
[1754.78 --> 1756.40]  popular
[1756.40 --> 1757.24]  opposition.
[1757.64 --> 1758.10]  He's the one
[1758.10 --> 1758.72]  who stands
[1758.72 --> 1759.40]  for covenant
[1759.40 --> 1760.30]  faithfulness.
[1762.80 --> 1764.20]  They all know
[1764.20 --> 1765.18]  he's leaving.
[1765.98 --> 1766.68]  They keep
[1766.68 --> 1767.34]  reminding
[1767.34 --> 1768.62]  Elisha
[1768.62 --> 1769.26]  and he keeps
[1769.26 --> 1769.70]  saying
[1769.70 --> 1770.40]  I know
[1770.40 --> 1771.60]  shut up
[1771.60 --> 1773.04]  basically.
[1773.04 --> 1777.64]  On the
[1777.64 --> 1778.18]  way
[1778.18 --> 1780.06]  Elijah
[1780.06 --> 1780.60]  keeps
[1780.60 --> 1781.16]  saying
[1781.16 --> 1781.72]  to
[1781.72 --> 1782.36]  Elisha
[1782.36 --> 1784.30]  stay
[1784.30 --> 1784.68]  here
[1784.68 --> 1785.18]  please
[1785.18 --> 1786.54]  I'm
[1786.54 --> 1786.78]  going
[1786.78 --> 1787.22]  on.
[1787.98 --> 1788.16]  Did you
[1788.16 --> 1788.38]  notice
[1788.38 --> 1788.58]  that?
[1789.28 --> 1790.00]  It's
[1790.00 --> 1790.40]  interesting
[1790.40 --> 1790.78]  in the
[1790.78 --> 1791.18]  Hebrew
[1791.18 --> 1792.30]  it's
[1792.30 --> 1792.62]  an
[1792.62 --> 1793.36]  imperative
[1793.36 --> 1794.68]  so it's
[1794.68 --> 1795.22]  a command
[1795.22 --> 1795.74]  stay
[1795.74 --> 1796.06]  here
[1796.06 --> 1796.84]  but he
[1796.84 --> 1797.30]  actually
[1797.30 --> 1798.12]  adds
[1798.12 --> 1798.76]  that
[1798.76 --> 1799.30]  little
[1799.30 --> 1799.98]  Hebrew
[1799.98 --> 1800.44]  sort
[1800.44 --> 1800.62]  of
[1800.62 --> 1801.60]  polite
[1801.60 --> 1802.70]  please
[1802.70 --> 1804.12]  the
[1804.12 --> 1804.52]  English
[1804.52 --> 1804.78]  Standard
[1804.78 --> 1805.06]  Version
[1805.06 --> 1805.42]  adds
[1805.42 --> 1805.62]  that
[1805.62 --> 1805.86]  into
[1805.86 --> 1806.04]  the
[1806.04 --> 1806.50]  translation
[1806.50 --> 1807.82]  stay
[1807.82 --> 1808.26]  here
[1808.26 --> 1809.36]  please
[1809.36 --> 1810.84]  I'm
[1810.84 --> 1811.12]  going
[1811.12 --> 1811.54]  on.
[1812.18 --> 1812.44]  It's
[1812.44 --> 1812.56]  an
[1812.56 --> 1812.98]  interesting
[1812.98 --> 1813.42]  way
[1813.42 --> 1813.70]  that
[1813.70 --> 1814.30]  he
[1814.30 --> 1815.78]  requests
[1815.78 --> 1816.72]  but
[1816.72 --> 1817.28]  doesn't
[1817.28 --> 1818.14]  demand
[1818.14 --> 1819.02]  that
[1819.02 --> 1819.56]  Elisha
[1819.56 --> 1819.96]  stay.
[1820.46 --> 1820.72]  It's
[1820.72 --> 1820.90]  almost
[1820.90 --> 1821.12]  like
[1821.12 --> 1821.56]  a
[1821.56 --> 1822.12]  strong
[1822.12 --> 1823.10]  suggestion.
[1824.68 --> 1825.24]  What's
[1825.24 --> 1825.70]  going on
[1825.70 --> 1825.80]  here?
[1825.92 --> 1826.18]  Some
[1826.18 --> 1826.44]  people
[1826.44 --> 1826.92]  claim
[1826.92 --> 1827.20]  that
[1827.20 --> 1827.66]  Elijah
[1827.66 --> 1827.92]  just
[1827.92 --> 1828.12]  wants
[1828.12 --> 1828.26]  to
[1828.26 --> 1828.38]  be
[1828.38 --> 1828.66]  alone
[1828.66 --> 1828.84]  he
[1828.84 --> 1829.02]  knows
[1829.02 --> 1829.26]  he's
[1829.26 --> 1829.56]  leaving
[1829.56 --> 1829.72]  and
[1829.72 --> 1829.82]  he
[1829.82 --> 1830.00]  wants
[1830.00 --> 1830.14]  to
[1830.14 --> 1830.26]  be
[1830.26 --> 1830.42]  on
[1830.42 --> 1830.58]  his
[1830.58 --> 1830.84]  own
[1830.84 --> 1831.56]  but
[1831.56 --> 1831.70]  I
[1831.70 --> 1831.84]  think
[1831.84 --> 1832.12]  there's
[1832.12 --> 1832.42]  something
[1832.42 --> 1832.74]  more
[1832.74 --> 1833.00]  going
[1833.00 --> 1833.22]  on
[1833.22 --> 1833.36]  and
[1833.36 --> 1833.64]  most
[1833.64 --> 1834.46]  commentators
[1834.46 --> 1834.88]  do.
[1837.02 --> 1837.54]  The
[1837.54 --> 1838.16]  polite
[1838.16 --> 1839.06]  request
[1839.06 --> 1840.22]  stay
[1840.22 --> 1840.48]  here
[1840.48 --> 1840.78]  please
[1840.78 --> 1841.18]  most
[1841.18 --> 1841.62]  likely
[1841.62 --> 1842.60]  represents
[1842.60 --> 1843.80]  another
[1843.80 --> 1844.42]  test.
[1845.24 --> 1845.50]  We saw
[1845.50 --> 1845.76]  a little
[1845.76 --> 1846.04]  bit of
[1846.04 --> 1846.18]  this
[1846.18 --> 1846.44]  last
[1846.44 --> 1846.58]  week
[1846.58 --> 1846.72]  but
[1846.72 --> 1846.82]  I
[1846.82 --> 1846.94]  want
[1846.94 --> 1847.02]  to
[1847.02 --> 1847.14]  go
[1847.14 --> 1847.42]  on
[1847.42 --> 1849.64]  share
[1849.64 --> 1849.94]  a little
[1849.94 --> 1850.10]  bit
[1850.10 --> 1850.34]  more
[1850.34 --> 1850.60]  about
[1850.60 --> 1850.86]  that.
[1851.34 --> 1851.62]  It's
[1851.62 --> 1851.74]  a
[1851.74 --> 1852.26]  request
[1852.26 --> 1852.50]  of
[1852.50 --> 1852.92]  sorts.
[1853.86 --> 1854.06]  Do
[1854.06 --> 1854.16]  you
[1854.16 --> 1854.52]  remember
[1854.52 --> 1855.02]  back
[1855.02 --> 1855.90]  in
[1855.90 --> 1856.14]  1
[1856.14 --> 1856.48]  Kings
[1856.48 --> 1857.40]  19
[1857.40 --> 1858.66]  in
[1858.66 --> 1858.90]  1
[1858.90 --> 1859.22]  Kings
[1859.22 --> 1859.94]  19
[1859.94 --> 1861.62]  when
[1861.62 --> 1862.42]  Elijah
[1862.42 --> 1863.14]  first
[1863.14 --> 1864.06]  calls
[1864.06 --> 1864.62]  Elisha
[1864.62 --> 1864.86]  and he
[1864.86 --> 1865.22]  throws
[1865.22 --> 1865.72]  his mantle
[1865.72 --> 1866.18]  over him
[1866.18 --> 1866.46]  and he
[1866.46 --> 1867.30]  calls him
[1867.30 --> 1867.86]  to follow
[1867.86 --> 1868.50]  after him
[1868.50 --> 1869.32]  what does
[1869.32 --> 1869.96]  Elisha
[1869.96 --> 1870.28]  say?
[1870.38 --> 1870.60]  He's
[1870.60 --> 1871.30]  plowing
[1871.30 --> 1872.40]  but he
[1872.40 --> 1872.80]  runs
[1872.80 --> 1873.14]  after
[1873.14 --> 1873.54]  Elijah
[1873.54 --> 1873.84]  and he
[1873.84 --> 1874.16]  says
[1874.16 --> 1875.30]  basically
[1875.30 --> 1875.60]  I'm
[1875.60 --> 1875.80]  going to
[1875.80 --> 1876.04]  follow
[1876.04 --> 1876.32]  you
[1876.32 --> 1876.96]  but
[1876.96 --> 1878.48]  let
[1878.48 --> 1878.66]  me
[1878.66 --> 1878.96]  go
[1878.96 --> 1879.28]  back
[1879.28 --> 1879.60]  first
[1879.60 --> 1879.88]  and
[1879.88 --> 1880.26]  kiss
[1880.26 --> 1880.60]  my
[1880.60 --> 1881.36]  mother
[1881.36 --> 1881.54]  and
[1881.54 --> 1881.72]  my
[1881.72 --> 1882.04]  father
[1882.04 --> 1882.58]  goodbye.
[1882.58 --> 1884.82]  Elijah
[1884.82 --> 1885.48]  says
[1885.48 --> 1885.66]  to
[1885.66 --> 1885.92]  him
[1885.92 --> 1887.14]  what

[1887.68 --> 1887.94]  you
[1887.94 --> 1889.08]  whatever
[1889.08 --> 1891.16]  now

[1894.70 --> 1896.36]  because
[1896.36 --> 1896.88]  partly
[1896.88 --> 1897.32]  the word
[1897.32 --> 1897.58]  that's

[1898.66 --> 1898.82]  his
[1898.82 --> 1899.14]  parents
[1899.14 --> 1899.32]  is
[1899.32 --> 1899.44]  the

[1906.42 --> 1906.60]  would
[1906.60 --> 1906.88]  agree
[1906.88 --> 1907.48]  it's

[1924.40 --> 1924.56]  you
[1924.56 --> 1924.98]  better
[1924.98 --> 1925.16]  know

[1931.70 --> 1932.22]  finally
[1932.22 --> 1932.46]  one
[1942.10 --> 1943.92]  he

[1951.82 --> 1952.28]  likely
[1952.28 --> 1952.82]  Jesus
[1952.82 --> 1953.42]  is

[2237.60 --> 2237.98]  this
[2237.98 --> 2238.92]  mantle
[2238.92 --> 2239.68]  the

[2247.70 --> 2248.06]  taken
[2248.06 --> 2248.30]  up

[2248.98 --> 2249.20]  taken
[2249.20 --> 2249.40]  up

[2251.86 --> 2252.42]  falls
[2252.42 --> 2252.72]  off

[2256.08 --> 2256.64]  Elisha
[2256.64 --> 2256.86]  picks
[2256.86 --> 2257.08]  it up
[2257.08 --> 2257.64]  now
[2257.64 --> 2258.06]  this
[2258.06 --> 2258.80]  mantle
[2258.80 --> 2260.04]  is

[2272.38 --> 2273.36]  the
[2273.36 --> 2273.66]  first
[2273.66 --> 2273.88]  time
[2273.88 --> 2273.98]  you
[2273.98 --> 2274.40]  remember
[2274.40 --> 2274.82]  when
[2274.82 --> 2275.62]  Elijah
[2275.62 --> 2276.44]  in
[2276.44 --> 2277.34]  dreadful
[2277.34 --> 2277.82]  fear
[2277.82 --> 2278.44]  and
[2278.44 --> 2278.86]  despair
[2278.86 --> 2279.44]  he
[2279.44 --> 2280.72]  leaves
[2280.72 --> 2281.06]  because
[2281.06 --> 2281.30]  he's
[2281.30 --> 2281.82]  being chased
[2281.82 --> 2282.44]  by Jezebel
[2282.44 --> 2282.80]  and he
[2282.80 --> 2283.26]  goes
[2283.26 --> 2283.94]  40 days
[2283.94 --> 2284.34]  journey

[2285.94 --> 2286.30]  hides
[2286.30 --> 2286.50]  out
[2286.50 --> 2286.70]  in the
[2286.70 --> 2286.88]  mountain
[2286.88 --> 2287.38]  and God
[2287.38 --> 2287.74]  comes
[2287.74 --> 2288.04]  to him
[2288.04 --> 2288.48]  eventually
[2288.48 --> 2288.96]  in that

[2289.38 --> 2289.78]  small

[2291.20 --> 2291.76]  calls
[2291.76 --> 2291.98]  him
[2291.98 --> 2292.46]  we're
[2292.46 --> 2292.74]  told
[2292.74 --> 2293.34]  Elijah
[2293.34 --> 2294.04]  went
[2294.04 --> 2294.50]  out

[2294.86 --> 2295.22]  cave
[2295.22 --> 2296.00]  and he
[2296.00 --> 2296.52]  covered
[2296.52 --> 2296.80]  his
[2296.80 --> 2297.26]  face
[2297.26 --> 2297.94]  with
[2297.94 --> 2298.16]  his
[2298.16 --> 2298.56]  mantle
[2298.56 --> 2299.64]  before
[2299.64 --> 2300.08]  God
[2300.08 --> 2301.70]  then
[2301.70 --> 2302.14]  just a
[2302.14 --> 2302.42]  few
[2302.42 --> 2302.80]  verses
[2302.80 --> 2303.42]  later
[2303.42 --> 2304.88]  when
[2304.88 --> 2305.02]  he
[2305.02 --> 2305.36]  goes
[2305.36 --> 2305.54]  when
[2305.54 --> 2305.92]  Elijah
[2305.92 --> 2306.22]  goes
[2306.22 --> 2306.38]  to
[2306.38 --> 2306.60]  call
[2306.60 --> 2307.06]  Elisha
[2307.06 --> 2307.36]  he

[2307.84 --> 2308.14]  same
[2308.14 --> 2308.48]  mantle
[2308.48 --> 2308.94]  and
[2308.94 --> 2309.10]  he
[2309.10 --> 2309.52]  throws
[2309.52 --> 2309.80]  it
[2309.80 --> 2310.22]  over
[2310.22 --> 2310.94]  Elisha
[2310.94 --> 2312.04]  as
[2312.04 --> 2312.26]  a
[2312.26 --> 2312.52]  sign
[2312.52 --> 2312.70]  of

[2314.50 --> 2314.68]  to
[2314.68 --> 2314.80]  be
[2314.80 --> 2314.98]  the

[2325.84 --> 2326.06]  it's
[2326.06 --> 2326.22]  only
[2326.22 --> 2326.46]  used
[2326.46 --> 2326.82]  12

[2334.10 --> 2334.70]  and
[2334.70 --> 2335.52]  Elisha
[2335.52 --> 2337.14]  it
[2337.14 --> 2338.08]  seemingly
[2338.08 --> 2338.78]  refers
[2338.78 --> 2339.74]  most
[2339.74 --> 2340.20]  commonly
[2340.20 --> 2340.96]  to

[2345.78 --> 2345.94]  one
[2345.94 --> 2346.10]  time
[2346.10 --> 2346.32]  it's
[2346.32 --> 2346.76]  translated
[2346.76 --> 2347.54]  glory
[2347.54 --> 2351.58]  now
[2351.58 --> 2352.76]  Elisha
[2352.76 --> 2355.26]  receives
[2355.26 --> 2355.80]  the
[2355.80 --> 2356.24]  mantle
[2356.24 --> 2358.24]  before
[2358.24 --> 2358.52]  it was
[2358.52 --> 2358.70]  just
[2358.70 --> 2358.94]  thrown
[2358.94 --> 2359.24]  over
[2359.24 --> 2359.46]  him
[2359.46 --> 2359.60]  but
[2359.60 --> 2359.80]  it's
[2359.80 --> 2359.98]  still
[2359.98 --> 2360.58]  Elijah's
[2360.58 --> 2360.84]  mantle
[2360.84 --> 2361.28]  now
[2361.28 --> 2361.94]  Elisha
[2361.94 --> 2362.44]  receives
[2362.44 --> 2362.62]  it

[2363.94 --> 2364.56]  his
[2364.56 --> 2365.38]  and
[2365.38 --> 2365.60]  so
[2365.60 --> 2365.78]  you
[2365.78 --> 2366.02]  have
[2366.02 --> 2366.24]  that
[2366.24 --> 2367.06]  succession
[2367.06 --> 2368.00]  of
[2368.00 --> 2368.42]  the
[2368.42 --> 2368.88]  prophet
[2368.88 --> 2369.58]  from
[2369.58 --> 2370.34]  Elijah
[2370.34 --> 2371.82]  to
[2371.82 --> 2372.58]  Elisha
[2372.58 --> 2376.18]  and
[2376.18 --> 2376.86]  like
[2376.86 --> 2377.84]  Joshua
[2377.84 --> 2379.04]  following

[2380.10 --> 2380.54]  Moses
[2380.54 --> 2381.68]  Elisha
[2381.68 --> 2382.08]  now
[2382.08 --> 2384.06]  goes
[2384.06 --> 2384.42]  across
[2384.42 --> 2384.66]  the
[2384.66 --> 2384.96]  Jordan
[2384.96 --> 2385.36]  again
[2385.36 --> 2386.78]  in

[2387.32 --> 2389.42]  to

[2389.94 --> 2391.90]  in

[2392.10 --> 2392.34]  their
[2392.34 --> 2392.82]  names
[2392.82 --> 2393.82]  mean
[2393.82 --> 2394.28]  exactly
[2394.28 --> 2394.74]  basically
[2394.74 --> 2395.16]  the same
[2395.16 --> 2395.48]  thing
[2395.48 --> 2396.48]  Elisha
[2396.48 --> 2396.98]  means
[2396.98 --> 2397.66]  God
[2397.66 --> 2398.14]  saves
[2398.14 --> 2400.20]  Joshua
[2400.20 --> 2400.76]  means
[2400.76 --> 2401.16]  the
[2401.16 --> 2401.48]  Lord
[2401.48 --> 2402.22]  saves
[2402.22 --> 2405.68]  and
[2405.68 --> 2405.92]  so
[2405.92 --> 2406.42]  here
[2406.42 --> 2406.88]  there's
[2406.88 --> 2407.10]  that

[2409.56 --> 2409.80]  really

[2419.54 --> 2420.14]  weeks ago
[2420.14 --> 2420.48]  I was
[2420.48 --> 2420.88]  preaching

[2428.50 --> 2428.86]  for the
[2428.86 --> 2429.12]  sermon
[2429.12 --> 2430.02]  and then
[2430.02 --> 2430.46]  they said
[2430.46 --> 2430.72]  this
[2430.72 --> 2431.10]  they said
[2431.10 --> 2431.76]  interesting
[2431.76 --> 2433.14]  Elijah
[2433.14 --> 2434.82]  Elisha
[2434.82 --> 2436.64]  Ernst
[2436.64 --> 2437.86]  Gary
[2437.86 --> 2440.00]  too bad
[2440.00 --> 2440.26]  my name
[2440.26 --> 2440.62]  doesn't start
[2440.62 --> 2440.96]  with E
[2440.96 --> 2441.48]  but
[2441.48 --> 2442.14]  anyway
[2442.14 --> 2442.50]  you get
[2442.50 --> 2442.82]  the point
[2442.82 --> 2443.20]  he was
[2443.20 --> 2443.96]  joking
[2443.96 --> 2444.36]  I think
[2444.36 --> 2444.58]  it's
[2444.58 --> 2444.86]  pushing
[2444.86 --> 2445.08]  the
[2445.08 --> 2445.46]  analogy
[2445.46 --> 2445.94]  a little
[2445.94 --> 2446.30]  bit
[2446.30 --> 2446.70]  okay
[2446.70 --> 2447.26]  but
[2447.26 --> 2447.56]  that
[2447.56 --> 2448.02]  idea
[2448.02 --> 2448.24]  of
[2448.24 --> 2448.60]  passing
[2448.60 --> 2448.84]  on
[2448.84 --> 2449.00]  the
[2449.00 --> 2449.56]  baton
[2449.56 --> 2450.50]  from
[2450.50 --> 2450.88]  one
[2450.88 --> 2451.26]  to
[2451.26 --> 2451.42]  the
[2451.42 --> 2451.62]  other
[2451.62 --> 2452.18]  that's
[2452.18 --> 2452.64]  essentially
[2452.64 --> 2453.08]  what's
[2453.08 --> 2453.56]  happening
[2453.56 --> 2454.62]  here
[2454.62 --> 2458.32]  Elisha
[2458.32 --> 2459.12]  now
[2459.12 --> 2460.16]  anointed
[2460.16 --> 2461.84]  now
[2461.84 --> 2462.26]  he's
[2462.26 --> 2462.48]  the
[2462.48 --> 2463.46]  successor
[2463.46 --> 2464.12]  to
[2464.12 --> 2464.58]  Elijah
[2464.58 --> 2466.12]  but
[2466.12 --> 2466.86]  did
[2466.86 --> 2467.02]  you
[2467.02 --> 2467.52]  notice
[2467.52 --> 2469.24]  Elisha
[2469.24 --> 2470.28]  doesn't
[2470.28 --> 2471.00]  feel
[2471.00 --> 2472.92]  all that
[2472.92 --> 2473.32]  much like
[2473.32 --> 2473.70]  a prophet
[2473.70 --> 2475.74]  he doesn't
[2475.74 --> 2476.30]  seem to
[2476.30 --> 2477.06]  feel anything
[2477.06 --> 2477.70]  in fact
[2477.70 --> 2478.08]  what he
[2478.08 --> 2478.54]  mainly
[2478.54 --> 2479.06]  feels
[2479.06 --> 2479.92]  is
[2479.92 --> 2480.54]  grief
[2480.54 --> 2482.82]  when
[2482.82 --> 2483.62]  Elijah's
[2483.62 --> 2484.12]  taken up
[2484.12 --> 2484.46]  he says
[2484.46 --> 2485.14]  my father
[2485.14 --> 2485.90]  my father
[2485.90 --> 2486.96]  the chariots
[2486.96 --> 2487.20]  and the
[2487.20 --> 2487.54]  horsemen
[2487.54 --> 2488.08]  of Israel
[2488.08 --> 2489.60]  and then
[2489.60 --> 2490.54]  he tears
[2490.54 --> 2491.50]  his clothes
[2491.50 --> 2492.58]  a sign
[2492.58 --> 2493.16]  of mourning
[2493.16 --> 2496.86]  and then
[2496.86 --> 2497.18]  when he
[2497.18 --> 2498.08]  takes
[2498.08 --> 2498.48]  that
[2498.48 --> 2500.44]  mantle
[2500.44 --> 2501.06]  and he
[2501.06 --> 2501.60]  slaps
[2501.60 --> 2501.92]  again
[2501.92 --> 2502.14]  the
[2502.14 --> 2502.74]  Jordan
[2502.74 --> 2503.22]  what's
[2503.22 --> 2503.36]  his
[2503.36 --> 2503.72]  comment
[2503.72 --> 2504.44]  where
[2504.44 --> 2504.92]  now
[2504.92 --> 2505.20]  is
[2505.20 --> 2505.40]  the
[2505.40 --> 2505.76]  Lord
[2505.76 --> 2506.02]  the
[2506.02 --> 2506.34]  God
[2506.34 --> 2506.48]  of
[2506.48 --> 2506.98]  Elijah
[2506.98 --> 2508.46]  is
[2508.46 --> 2508.58]  he
[2508.58 --> 2508.84]  even
[2508.84 --> 2509.26]  here
[2509.26 --> 2509.92]  he
[2509.92 --> 2510.42]  seemingly
[2510.42 --> 2510.98]  doesn't
[2510.98 --> 2511.66]  feel
[2511.66 --> 2512.62]  anything
[2512.62 --> 2514.62]  and
[2514.62 --> 2514.84]  that's
[2514.84 --> 2515.18]  an important
[2515.18 --> 2515.46]  point
[2515.46 --> 2515.74]  I think
[2515.74 --> 2516.54]  the prophet
[2516.54 --> 2517.30]  doesn't
[2517.30 --> 2517.86]  always
[2517.86 --> 2518.68]  feel
[2518.68 --> 2519.36]  good
[2519.36 --> 2522.92]  think
[2522.92 --> 2523.08]  of
[2523.08 --> 2523.50]  Jesus
[2523.50 --> 2525.42]  at
[2525.42 --> 2525.90]  his
[2525.90 --> 2526.70]  anointing
[2526.70 --> 2527.32]  at
[2527.32 --> 2527.50]  his
[2527.50 --> 2528.02]  baptism
[2528.02 --> 2528.96]  wow
[2528.96 --> 2529.52]  it must
[2529.52 --> 2529.64]  have
[2529.64 --> 2529.78]  been
[2529.78 --> 2530.10]  spine
[2530.10 --> 2530.52]  tingling
[2530.52 --> 2530.80]  right
[2530.80 --> 2531.34]  voices
[2531.34 --> 2531.70]  from
[2531.70 --> 2532.06]  heaven
[2532.06 --> 2532.72]  this
[2532.72 --> 2532.84]  is
[2532.84 --> 2533.02]  my
[2533.02 --> 2533.34]  beloved
[2533.34 --> 2533.66]  son
[2533.66 --> 2533.80]  in
[2533.80 --> 2533.92]  whom
[2533.92 --> 2534.10]  I'm
[2534.10 --> 2534.26]  well
[2534.26 --> 2534.56]  pleased
[2534.56 --> 2535.22]  and
[2535.22 --> 2536.12]  a
[2536.12 --> 2536.86]  dove
[2536.86 --> 2537.10]  in
[2537.10 --> 2537.26]  the
[2537.26 --> 2537.62]  spirit
[2537.62 --> 2537.92]  must
[2537.92 --> 2538.02]  have
[2538.02 --> 2538.18]  been
[2538.18 --> 2538.60]  great
[2538.60 --> 2539.08]  what
[2539.08 --> 2539.40]  comes
[2539.40 --> 2539.88]  next
[2539.88 --> 2540.80]  he
[2540.80 --> 2541.14]  sent
[2541.14 --> 2541.38]  off
[2541.38 --> 2541.56]  into
[2541.56 --> 2541.92]  the
[2541.92 --> 2542.34]  desert
[2542.34 --> 2543.18]  to
[2543.18 --> 2543.36]  be
[2543.36 --> 2543.86]  tested
[2543.86 --> 2545.70]  and
[2545.70 --> 2545.84]  of
[2545.84 --> 2545.96]  course
[2545.96 --> 2546.36]  eventually
[2546.36 --> 2546.62]  in
[2546.62 --> 2546.78]  his
[2546.78 --> 2546.98]  whole
[2546.98 --> 2547.36]  life
[2547.36 --> 2547.52]  he
[2547.52 --> 2548.04]  ends
[2548.04 --> 2548.22]  up
[2548.22 --> 2548.36]  on
[2548.36 --> 2548.52]  the
[2548.52 --> 2549.10]  cross
[2549.10 --> 2549.84]  crying
[2549.84 --> 2550.02]  my
[2550.02 --> 2550.26]  God
[2550.26 --> 2550.40]  my
[2550.40 --> 2550.66]  God
[2550.66 --> 2550.86]  why
[2550.86 --> 2551.06]  have
[2551.06 --> 2551.44]  you
[2551.44 --> 2551.92]  forsaken
[2551.92 --> 2552.24]  me
[2552.24 --> 2553.48]  prophets
[2553.48 --> 2554.04]  don't
[2554.04 --> 2554.50]  always
[2554.50 --> 2555.18]  feel
[2555.18 --> 2556.18]  great
[2556.18 --> 2557.14]  and
[2557.14 --> 2557.28]  have
[2557.28 --> 2557.64]  wonderful
[2557.64 --> 2558.12]  feelings
[2558.12 --> 2558.46]  the
[2558.46 --> 2559.00]  anointing
[2559.00 --> 2559.44]  isn't
[2559.44 --> 2559.98]  always
[2559.98 --> 2560.52]  a
[2560.52 --> 2560.76]  good
[2560.76 --> 2561.28]  feeling
[2561.28 --> 2562.94]  but
[2562.94 --> 2563.14]  there
[2563.14 --> 2563.52]  are
[2563.52 --> 2564.76]  confirmations
[2564.76 --> 2565.48]  that
[2565.48 --> 2566.06]  Elisha
[2566.06 --> 2566.68]  is
[2566.68 --> 2567.36]  indeed
[2567.36 --> 2567.72]  the
[2567.72 --> 2568.10]  prophet
[2568.10 --> 2569.98]  first
[2569.98 --> 2571.00]  clearly
[2571.00 --> 2572.04]  God's
[2572.04 --> 2572.58]  power
[2572.58 --> 2573.14]  at work
[2573.14 --> 2573.54]  in him
[2573.54 --> 2573.98]  he
[2573.98 --> 2574.62]  does
[2574.62 --> 2575.28]  part
[2575.28 --> 2575.66]  the
[2575.66 --> 2576.02]  water
[2576.02 --> 2576.72]  and
[2576.72 --> 2576.84]  if
[2576.84 --> 2576.94]  you
[2576.94 --> 2577.14]  go
[2577.14 --> 2577.62]  on
[2577.62 --> 2578.20]  in
[2578.20 --> 2578.58]  the
[2578.58 --> 2578.90]  chapter
[2578.90 --> 2579.24]  that's
[2579.24 --> 2579.44]  actually
[2579.44 --> 2579.72]  part
[2579.72 --> 2580.10]  three
[2580.10 --> 2580.34]  of
[2580.34 --> 2580.52]  this
[2580.52 --> 2580.72]  sermon
[2580.72 --> 2581.10]  series
[2581.10 --> 2581.64]  you
[2581.64 --> 2581.84]  go
[2581.84 --> 2582.06]  on
[2582.06 --> 2582.16]  in
[2582.16 --> 2582.30]  the
[2582.30 --> 2582.68]  chapter
[2582.68 --> 2583.70]  he
[2583.70 --> 2584.08]  does
[2584.08 --> 2584.44]  other
[2584.44 --> 2584.96]  miracles
[2584.96 --> 2586.78]  he
[2586.78 --> 2587.80]  cleans
[2587.80 --> 2588.02]  up
[2588.02 --> 2588.56]  water
[2588.56 --> 2590.02]  and
[2590.02 --> 2590.34]  he
[2590.34 --> 2590.74]  sends
[2590.74 --> 2591.02]  some
[2591.02 --> 2591.44]  bears
[2591.44 --> 2593.22]  and
[2593.22 --> 2593.84]  there's
[2593.84 --> 2594.56]  miracles
[2594.56 --> 2595.08]  happening
[2595.08 --> 2595.72]  surrounding
[2595.72 --> 2596.36]  the person
[2596.36 --> 2596.70]  of
[2596.70 --> 2597.16]  Elisha
[2597.16 --> 2597.52]  in
[2597.52 --> 2597.76]  fact
[2597.76 --> 2598.30]  Elisha
[2598.30 --> 2598.54]  is
[2598.54 --> 2598.78]  very
[2598.78 --> 2599.04]  much
[2599.04 --> 2599.22]  a
[2599.22 --> 2599.50]  great
[2599.50 --> 2599.94]  worker
[2599.94 --> 2600.42]  of
[2600.42 --> 2601.14]  miracles
[2601.14 --> 2601.96]  more
[2601.96 --> 2602.20]  so
[2602.20 --> 2602.38]  than
[2602.38 --> 2602.84]  Elijah
[2602.84 --> 2605.66]  it's
[2605.66 --> 2606.14]  interesting
[2606.14 --> 2606.74]  the
[2606.74 --> 2607.50]  difference
[2607.50 --> 2608.02]  between
[2608.02 --> 2608.22]  the
[2608.22 --> 2608.40]  different
[2608.40 --> 2608.70]  kinds
[2608.70 --> 2608.86]  of
[2608.86 --> 2609.20]  prophets
[2609.20 --> 2609.40]  in
[2609.40 --> 2609.52]  the
[2609.52 --> 2609.66]  Old
[2609.66 --> 2610.04]  Testament
[2610.04 --> 2611.16]  when
[2611.16 --> 2611.46]  we
[2611.46 --> 2611.70]  think
[2611.70 --> 2611.86]  of
[2611.86 --> 2612.30]  prophet
[2612.30 --> 2612.82]  we
[2612.82 --> 2613.36]  primarily
[2613.36 --> 2613.80]  think
[2613.80 --> 2614.08]  of
[2614.08 --> 2614.56]  the
[2614.56 --> 2614.92]  Isaiah
[2614.92 --> 2615.22]  and
[2615.22 --> 2615.36]  the
[2615.36 --> 2615.66]  Jeremiah
[2615.66 --> 2616.08]  and
[2616.08 --> 2616.22]  the
[2616.22 --> 2616.72]  Ezekiel
[2616.72 --> 2616.96]  and
[2616.96 --> 2617.08]  the
[2617.08 --> 2617.28]  minor
[2617.28 --> 2617.60]  prophets
[2617.60 --> 2617.80]  and
[2617.80 --> 2617.98]  all
[2617.98 --> 2618.10]  of
[2618.10 --> 2618.40]  those
[2618.40 --> 2618.80]  and
[2618.80 --> 2618.96]  what
[2618.96 --> 2619.08]  did
[2619.08 --> 2619.22]  they
[2619.22 --> 2619.54]  mainly
[2619.54 --> 2619.88]  do
[2619.88 --> 2620.78]  they
[2620.78 --> 2621.18]  mainly
[2621.18 --> 2621.80]  spoke
[2621.80 --> 2622.64]  the
[2622.64 --> 2622.82]  word
[2622.82 --> 2622.94]  of
[2622.94 --> 2623.06]  the
[2623.06 --> 2623.30]  Lord
[2623.30 --> 2623.80]  this
[2623.80 --> 2623.94]  is
[2623.94 --> 2624.06]  the
[2624.06 --> 2624.16]  word
[2624.16 --> 2624.24]  of
[2624.24 --> 2624.36]  the
[2624.36 --> 2624.50]  Lord
[2624.50 --> 2624.66]  they
[2624.66 --> 2625.44]  declared
[2625.44 --> 2625.94]  and
[2625.94 --> 2626.50]  eventually
[2626.50 --> 2626.80]  wrote
[2626.80 --> 2627.12]  down
[2627.12 --> 2627.30]  the
[2627.30 --> 2627.84]  oracles
[2627.84 --> 2628.12]  of

[2628.58 --> 2629.24]  God's
[2629.24 --> 2629.68]  speech
[2629.68 --> 2630.74]  you
[2630.74 --> 2630.98]  don't
[2630.98 --> 2631.24]  have
[2631.24 --> 2631.46]  much
[2631.46 --> 2631.60]  of

[2634.06 --> 2634.28]  and
[2634.28 --> 2634.68]  Elisha
[2634.68 --> 2634.84]  are
[2634.84 --> 2635.10]  very
[2635.10 --> 2635.38]  much
[2635.38 --> 2635.70]  more
[2635.70 --> 2637.10]  workers
[2637.10 --> 2638.04]  of

[2640.64 --> 2640.86]  in
[2640.86 --> 2641.12]  them
[2641.12 --> 2641.92]  and
[2641.92 --> 2642.04]  they
[2642.04 --> 2642.24]  don't
[2642.24 --> 2642.50]  leave
[2642.50 --> 2643.02]  legacies

[2644.50 --> 2644.88]  after
[2644.88 --> 2645.18]  them
[2645.18 --> 2646.74]  but
[2646.74 --> 2646.90]  they
[2646.90 --> 2647.08]  are
[2647.08 --> 2647.50]  workers
[2647.50 --> 2647.72]  of
[2647.72 --> 2648.16]  miracles
[2648.16 --> 2648.78]  and

[2649.40 --> 2649.62]  in
[2649.62 --> 2650.10]  particular
[2650.10 --> 2651.14]  so
[2651.14 --> 2651.42]  that's
[2651.42 --> 2651.58]  the
[2651.58 --> 2652.24]  first
[2652.24 --> 2652.70]  clear
[2652.70 --> 2653.12]  sign
[2653.12 --> 2653.66]  confirmation
[2653.66 --> 2653.96]  that
[2653.96 --> 2654.18]  he
[2654.18 --> 2654.42]  is
[2654.42 --> 2654.56]  the

[2655.50 --> 2656.16]  powerful
[2656.16 --> 2656.78]  acts
[2656.78 --> 2657.44]  but
[2657.44 --> 2657.62]  the
[2657.62 --> 2657.90]  second
[2657.90 --> 2658.16]  one
[2658.16 --> 2658.40]  is
[2658.40 --> 2659.54]  the

[2660.72 --> 2661.68]  anointing
[2661.68 --> 2662.32]  and how
[2662.32 --> 2662.70]  the other
[2662.70 --> 2663.26]  prophets
[2663.26 --> 2663.88]  recognize
[2663.88 --> 2664.32]  it
[2664.32 --> 2665.20]  did you
[2665.20 --> 2665.46]  notice
[2665.46 --> 2665.66]  that
[2665.66 --> 2665.84]  when
[2665.84 --> 2666.06]  he
[2666.06 --> 2666.52]  comes
[2666.52 --> 2666.74]  out
[2666.74 --> 2667.04]  comes
[2667.04 --> 2667.38]  back
[2667.38 --> 2667.82]  across
[2667.82 --> 2668.06]  he
[2668.06 --> 2668.62]  parts
[2668.62 --> 2668.82]  the
[2668.82 --> 2669.08]  water
[2669.08 --> 2669.22]  and
[2669.22 --> 2669.30]  he
[2669.30 --> 2669.46]  comes
[2669.46 --> 2669.80]  across
[2669.80 --> 2670.46]  it's
[2670.46 --> 2670.78]  clear
[2670.78 --> 2670.94]  to
[2670.94 --> 2671.06]  the
[2671.06 --> 2671.22]  other
[2671.22 --> 2671.60]  prophets
[2671.60 --> 2671.82]  and
[2671.82 --> 2672.00]  they
[2672.00 --> 2672.26]  say
[2672.26 --> 2672.96]  wow
[2672.96 --> 2673.46]  the
[2673.46 --> 2673.92]  spirit
[2673.92 --> 2674.10]  of
[2674.10 --> 2674.54]  Elijah
[2674.54 --> 2675.00]  now
[2675.00 --> 2675.60]  rests
[2675.60 --> 2676.08]  on
[2676.08 --> 2677.00]  Elisha
[2677.00 --> 2679.58]  and
[2679.58 --> 2679.78]  they
[2679.78 --> 2680.44]  bow
[2680.44 --> 2681.08]  before
[2681.08 --> 2681.32]  him
[2681.32 --> 2681.70]  they
[2681.70 --> 2682.54]  acknowledge
[2682.54 --> 2683.18]  his
[2683.18 --> 2683.74]  authority
[2683.74 --> 2688.48]  but what's
[2688.48 --> 2689.38]  key here
[2689.38 --> 2690.50]  is that
[2690.50 --> 2692.02]  the
[2692.02 --> 2692.96]  ministry
[2692.96 --> 2694.10]  and the
[2694.10 --> 2694.48]  work
[2694.48 --> 2694.88]  of
[2694.88 --> 2695.34]  Elijah
[2695.34 --> 2695.96]  as
[2695.96 --> 2696.96]  God's
[2696.96 --> 2697.56]  prophet
[2697.56 --> 2698.34]  the
[2698.34 --> 2699.00]  Lord's
[2699.00 --> 2699.36]  prophet
[2699.36 --> 2700.26]  can
[2700.26 --> 2700.98]  only
[2700.98 --> 2701.58]  happen
[2701.58 --> 2702.94]  with the
[2702.94 --> 2703.36]  spirit's
[2703.36 --> 2703.84]  anointing
[2703.84 --> 2706.72]  there are
[2706.72 --> 2707.52]  other prophets
[2707.52 --> 2707.84]  around
[2707.84 --> 2708.08]  right
[2708.08 --> 2708.60]  a company
[2708.60 --> 2709.32]  of 50
[2709.32 --> 2710.16]  just
[2710.16 --> 2710.36]  at
[2710.36 --> 2710.76]  Jericho
[2710.76 --> 2711.24]  itself
[2711.24 --> 2711.58]  at
[2711.58 --> 2711.92]  least
[2711.92 --> 2712.62]  and
[2712.62 --> 2712.74]  there
[2712.74 --> 2712.88]  are
[2712.88 --> 2713.20]  others
[2713.20 --> 2713.40]  in
[2713.40 --> 2713.84]  Bethel
[2713.84 --> 2714.02]  and
[2714.02 --> 2714.40]  Gilgal
[2714.40 --> 2714.56]  there
[2714.56 --> 2714.70]  are
[2714.70 --> 2715.12]  prophets
[2715.12 --> 2715.60]  all over
[2715.60 --> 2715.76]  the
[2715.76 --> 2716.18]  place
[2716.18 --> 2719.36]  Elisha
[2719.36 --> 2720.06]  prior to
[2720.06 --> 2720.50]  this time
[2720.50 --> 2721.38]  had served
[2721.38 --> 2722.24]  under
[2722.24 --> 2723.10]  Elijah
[2723.10 --> 2723.78]  and had
[2723.78 --> 2724.84]  seemingly
[2724.84 --> 2725.64]  walked
[2725.64 --> 2726.22]  with him
[2726.22 --> 2726.74]  but he
[2726.74 --> 2727.20]  wasn't
[2727.20 --> 2727.64]  yet the
[2727.64 --> 2728.14]  really
[2728.14 --> 2728.94]  anointed
[2728.94 --> 2729.58]  prophet
[2729.58 --> 2729.82]  it
[2729.82 --> 2733.48]  and
[2733.48 --> 2734.04]  recall
[2734.04 --> 2734.60]  again
[2734.60 --> 2735.10]  from last
[2735.10 --> 2735.38]  week
[2735.38 --> 2735.86]  how
[2735.86 --> 2737.14]  when he
[2737.14 --> 2738.02]  requests
[2738.02 --> 2738.66]  that
[2738.66 --> 2739.62]  double
[2739.62 --> 2740.10]  portion
[2740.10 --> 2741.20]  of the
[2741.20 --> 2741.48]  spirit
[2741.48 --> 2741.82]  that
[2741.82 --> 2742.54]  firstborn
[2742.54 --> 2743.06]  son
[2743.06 --> 2743.98]  type
[2743.98 --> 2744.44]  of
[2744.44 --> 2746.26]  inheritance
[2746.26 --> 2746.88]  from
[2746.88 --> 2747.30]  Elijah
[2747.30 --> 2748.16]  Elijah
[2748.16 --> 2748.54]  said
[2748.54 --> 2749.10]  wow
[2749.10 --> 2749.56]  that's
[2749.56 --> 2750.40]  that's
[2750.40 --> 2750.70]  tough
[2750.70 --> 2751.46]  that's
[2751.46 --> 2752.04]  a hard
[2752.04 --> 2752.60]  thing
[2752.60 --> 2757.54]  but
[2757.54 --> 2757.86]  that's
[2757.86 --> 2758.54]  essential
[2758.54 --> 2759.58]  for the
[2759.58 --> 2759.86]  prophet
[2759.86 --> 2760.16]  of the
[2760.16 --> 2760.40]  Lord
[2760.40 --> 2761.76]  and
[2761.76 --> 2762.08]  again
[2762.08 --> 2762.88]  think
[2762.88 --> 2763.38]  about
[2763.38 --> 2763.68]  the
[2763.68 --> 2764.14]  person
[2764.14 --> 2764.54]  of
[2764.54 --> 2764.88]  Jesus
[2764.88 --> 2765.46]  Christ
[2765.46 --> 2767.26]  Jesus
[2767.26 --> 2768.08]  at
[2768.08 --> 2768.40]  his
[2768.40 --> 2769.04]  baptism
[2769.04 --> 2770.44]  at
[2770.44 --> 2770.64]  that
[2770.64 --> 2771.20]  anointing
[2771.20 --> 2771.78]  that
[2771.78 --> 2772.34]  you
[2772.34 --> 2772.72]  realize
[2772.72 --> 2772.98]  we
[2772.98 --> 2773.22]  don't
[2773.22 --> 2773.50]  know
[2773.50 --> 2773.98]  much
[2773.98 --> 2774.34]  about
[2774.34 --> 2774.66]  Jesus
[2774.66 --> 2775.04]  life
[2775.04 --> 2775.48]  prior
[2775.48 --> 2775.72]  to
[2775.72 --> 2776.00]  that
[2776.00 --> 2776.98]  we
[2776.98 --> 2777.22]  know
[2777.22 --> 2778.00]  his
[2778.00 --> 2778.40]  birth
[2778.40 --> 2779.48]  we
[2779.48 --> 2779.72]  hear
[2779.72 --> 2779.96]  about
[2779.96 --> 2780.10]  him
[2780.10 --> 2780.22]  in
[2780.22 --> 2780.38]  the
[2780.38 --> 2780.72]  temple
[2780.72 --> 2781.14]  but
[2781.14 --> 2781.32]  we
[2781.32 --> 2781.54]  hear
[2781.54 --> 2781.96]  very
[2781.96 --> 2782.26]  little
[2782.26 --> 2782.70]  otherwise
[2782.70 --> 2784.34]  it's
[2784.34 --> 2784.72]  at
[2784.72 --> 2785.10]  the
[2785.10 --> 2785.68]  baptism
[2785.68 --> 2786.36]  and
[2786.36 --> 2786.52]  the
[2786.52 --> 2787.00]  anointing
[2787.00 --> 2787.14]  by
[2787.14 --> 2787.30]  the
[2787.30 --> 2787.56]  spirit
[2787.56 --> 2788.10]  that
[2788.10 --> 2788.56]  Jesus
[2788.56 --> 2788.84]  is
[2788.84 --> 2789.50]  launched
[2789.50 --> 2790.18]  into
[2790.18 --> 2790.82]  his
[2790.82 --> 2791.52]  ministry
[2791.52 --> 2792.74]  in
[2792.74 --> 2793.08]  fact
[2793.08 --> 2793.34]  it's
[2793.34 --> 2793.84]  interesting
[2793.84 --> 2794.18]  in the
[2794.18 --> 2794.42]  early
[2794.42 --> 2794.94]  church
[2794.94 --> 2795.64]  in
[2795.64 --> 2795.96]  addition
[2795.96 --> 2796.20]  to
[2796.20 --> 2796.38]  of
[2796.38 --> 2796.56]  course
[2796.56 --> 2796.78]  good
[2796.78 --> 2797.08]  Friday
[2797.08 --> 2797.28]  and
[2797.28 --> 2797.62]  Easter
[2797.62 --> 2798.48]  the
[2798.48 --> 2799.14]  big
[2799.14 --> 2800.16]  celebration
[2800.16 --> 2802.84]  was
[2802.84 --> 2803.42]  his
[2803.42 --> 2803.92]  baptism
[2803.92 --> 2805.34]  long
[2805.34 --> 2805.72]  before
[2805.72 --> 2806.22]  Christmas
[2806.22 --> 2806.76]  was
[2806.76 --> 2807.06]  ever
[2807.06 --> 2807.60]  celebrated
[2807.60 --> 2809.26]  Jesus
[2809.26 --> 2810.32]  baptism
[2810.32 --> 2811.48]  because
[2811.48 --> 2812.14]  that
[2812.14 --> 2812.72]  was
[2812.72 --> 2813.04]  a
[2813.04 --> 2813.34]  pivotal
[2813.34 --> 2813.80]  moment
[2813.80 --> 2814.46]  that
[2814.46 --> 2814.70]  was
[2814.70 --> 2814.84]  the
[2814.84 --> 2815.42]  anointing
[2815.42 --> 2816.18]  that's
[2816.18 --> 2816.46]  what he
[2816.46 --> 2816.80]  needed
[2816.80 --> 2817.24]  in order
[2817.24 --> 2817.52]  to
[2817.52 --> 2818.16]  really
[2818.16 --> 2819.54]  do
[2819.54 --> 2819.98]  God's
[2819.98 --> 2820.30]  work
[2820.30 --> 2824.10]  and
[2824.10 --> 2824.30]  so
[2824.30 --> 2825.10]  Elisha
[2825.10 --> 2825.42]  is
[2825.42 --> 2825.84]  often
[2825.84 --> 2826.44]  seen
[2826.44 --> 2828.02]  for
[2828.02 --> 2828.28]  New
[2828.28 --> 2828.64]  Testament
[2828.64 --> 2829.16]  Christians
[2829.16 --> 2830.00]  as a
[2830.00 --> 2830.60]  type
[2830.60 --> 2831.28]  of
[2831.28 --> 2831.68]  Jesus
[2831.68 --> 2832.88]  he's
[2832.88 --> 2832.98]  a
[2832.98 --> 2833.26]  miracle
[2833.26 --> 2833.66]  worker
[2833.66 --> 2834.80]  he's
[2834.80 --> 2835.32]  anointed
[2835.32 --> 2835.78]  in that
[2835.78 --> 2836.06]  way
[2836.06 --> 2837.84]  you have
[2837.84 --> 2838.12]  again
[2838.12 --> 2838.34]  that
[2838.34 --> 2838.84]  passing
[2838.84 --> 2839.14]  on
[2839.14 --> 2839.28]  of

[3106.54 --> 3107.38]  world
[3107.38 --> 3109.68]  and it's
[3109.68 --> 3110.70]  not unusual
[3110.70 --> 3112.18]  or surprising
[3112.18 --> 3113.54]  to feel

[3344.42 --> 3344.62]  the
[3344.62 --> 3345.00]  father
[3345.00 --> 3346.46]  amen
[3346.46 --> 3349.12]  we're
[3349.12 --> 3349.28]  going
[3349.28 --> 3349.82]  to sing
[3349.82 --> 3350.36]  now
[3350.36 --> 3351.38]  faithful
[3351.38 --> 3351.86]  one
[3351.86 --> 3365.14]  in
[3369.92 --> 3376.14] なた
[3376.14 --> 3376.26]  painful
[3376.34 --> 3377.54]  one
[3377.54 --> 3378.22]  so
[3378.22 --> 3380.54]  unchanging
[3380.54 --> 3392.04]  Ageless one, you're my rock of peace
[3392.04 --> 3399.36]  Lord of all, I depend on you
[3399.36 --> 3410.04]  I call out to you again and again
[3410.04 --> 3418.62]  I call out to you again and again
[3418.62 --> 3427.52]  You are my rock in times of trouble
[3427.52 --> 3437.54]  You lift me up when I fall down
[3437.54 --> 3446.12]  All through the storm, your love is
[3446.12 --> 3457.12]  The anchor, my hope is in you alone
[3457.12 --> 3466.54]  Faithful one, so unchanging
[3466.54 --> 3477.40]  Ageless one, you're my rock of peace
[3477.40 --> 3484.98]  Lord of all, I depend on you
[3484.98 --> 3494.40]  I call out to you again and again
[3494.40 --> 3502.98]  I call out to you again and again
[3502.98 --> 3512.56]  You are my rock in times of trouble
[3512.56 --> 3521.14]  You lift me up when I fall down
[3521.14 --> 3529.72]  All through the storm, your love is
[3529.72 --> 3540.72]  The anchor, my hope is in you alone
[3540.72 --> 3559.10]  Two announcements before we come before the Lord in our community prayer
[3559.10 --> 3570.10]  And that is, many of you have been and are still praying of course for the recovery of Andre Grotendorst
[3570.72 --> 3572.86]  Son of Rick and Yvonne
[3572.86 --> 3577.34]  And we heard a lot of positive news about this and we praise God for that
[3577.34 --> 3579.46]  I'm sure that there will be a long time of recovery
[3579.46 --> 3584.06]  But God is good and so we thank the Lord for that
[3584.06 --> 3589.36]  Also, Winnie and I had this morning an early phone call
[3589.36 --> 3591.38]  And from Edmonton
[3591.38 --> 3594.06]  And we became grandparents again
[3594.06 --> 3596.06]  A healthy baby girl
[3596.06 --> 3598.24]  Ellie, Johanna
[3598.24 --> 3601.66]  Daughter of Hendrick and Kim
[3601.66 --> 3603.82]  And so we are very thankful for that
[3603.82 --> 3607.60]  That's a personal thing I thought I'm allowed to say
[3607.60 --> 3609.62]  So let us pray now
[3609.62 --> 3611.66]  And come before the Lord our God
[3611.66 --> 3612.56]  Our faithful God
[3612.56 --> 3617.14]  Lord God of Abraham
[3617.14 --> 3619.80]  Isaac and Israel
[3619.80 --> 3624.16]  God of Elijah and Elisha
[3624.16 --> 3627.24]  And the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3627.24 --> 3633.12]  Faithful God, you are the same yesterday, today
[3633.12 --> 3635.16]  And tomorrow
[3635.16 --> 3639.14]  And so because of that we can
[3639.14 --> 3640.06]  We praise you
[3640.06 --> 3641.92]  As our God and our Savior
[3641.92 --> 3646.92]  Because you also then carry our daily burdens
[3646.92 --> 3651.04]  And so this morning we come again with that question
[3651.04 --> 3652.98]  To who else could we come
[3652.98 --> 3654.00]  And could we go
[3654.00 --> 3656.54]  And come with our prayers and requests
[3656.54 --> 3660.98]  Lord God, you are the creator of heaven and earth
[3660.98 --> 3662.42]  We heard it this morning from the Psalms
[3662.42 --> 3664.22]  And so we praise you for sunshine
[3664.22 --> 3666.76]  We thank you for sunshine
[3666.76 --> 3667.90]  And for food
[3667.90 --> 3670.08]  And for life
[3670.08 --> 3674.60]  But this week we were also reminded again
[3674.60 --> 3676.58]  Of that great enemy called death
[3676.58 --> 3679.96]  We were reminded again of death
[3679.96 --> 3680.88]  And of sickness
[3680.88 --> 3684.18]  And Lord God, we pray this morning
[3684.18 --> 3685.44]  For the Van Dob family
[3685.44 --> 3686.54]  For Sandy
[3686.54 --> 3688.02]  The children
[3688.02 --> 3689.24]  And grandchildren
[3689.24 --> 3692.44]  With the passing away of Bill
[3692.44 --> 3694.82]  And Lord, we ask that you will comfort them
[3694.82 --> 3697.94]  After this long, long struggle
[3697.94 --> 3701.12]  That Bill is now with you
[3701.12 --> 3706.06]  That he has a new body
[3706.06 --> 3707.02]  And a new mind
[3707.02 --> 3712.70]  Heavenly Father, we pray for the sick
[3712.70 --> 3715.42]  And we thank you Lord
[3715.42 --> 3716.60]  For the good news
[3716.60 --> 3719.04]  For Andrew
[3719.04 --> 3720.66]  Andrew Grotendorst
[3720.66 --> 3724.22]  And Lord, that you will continue to be with him
[3724.22 --> 3725.58]  And in hospital
[3725.58 --> 3727.66]  And that you will continue to heal him
[3727.66 --> 3729.26]  As well as the other ones
[3729.26 --> 3731.30]  Involved in that horrific accident
[3731.30 --> 3736.36]  Lord God, we pray for the sick in our midst
[3736.36 --> 3741.58]  We pray every week for Tim
[3741.58 --> 3742.54]  And for Joan
[3742.54 --> 3743.34]  And for Kathy
[3743.34 --> 3746.48]  That struggle with cancer
[3746.48 --> 3747.94]  And the difficult days
[3747.94 --> 3749.02]  They experience
[3749.02 --> 3750.80]  Lord God, we give them
[3750.80 --> 3753.00]  And comfort them also in the knowledge
[3753.00 --> 3753.96]  That you are with them
[3753.96 --> 3755.84]  Yesterday and today
[3755.84 --> 3757.96]  And tomorrow and forever
[3757.96 --> 3761.62]  Lord God, we pray for all the other ones
[3761.62 --> 3762.18]  In our midst
[3762.18 --> 3763.44]  Who struggle with ailments
[3763.44 --> 3767.42]  With depression and loneliness
[3767.42 --> 3768.44]  We pray Lord God
[3768.44 --> 3769.00]  For our
[3769.00 --> 3770.56]  Especially our
[3770.56 --> 3771.74]  Our very old members
[3771.74 --> 3772.54]  In our church
[3772.54 --> 3773.02]  Who are
[3773.02 --> 3774.42]  Still at home
[3774.42 --> 3775.32]  And are in senior
[3775.32 --> 3776.96]  Centers
[3776.96 --> 3777.74]  Lord God
[3777.74 --> 3780.48]  In this difficult time
[3780.48 --> 3782.40]  Will you comfort them
[3782.40 --> 3784.08]  And be with them
[3784.08 --> 3787.06]  Lord God, we pray
[3787.06 --> 3788.00]  For this world
[3788.00 --> 3789.78]  As you could hear this morning
[3789.78 --> 3791.72]  Sometimes people say
[3791.72 --> 3792.26]  Where are you?
[3792.66 --> 3793.38]  For the nations
[3793.38 --> 3796.26]  The crisis that we are facing
[3796.26 --> 3797.08]  During this
[3797.08 --> 3798.94]  Pandemic
[3798.94 --> 3800.94]  And so Lord God
[3800.94 --> 3801.94]  As you have prayed many times
[3801.94 --> 3802.72]  For healthcare workers
[3802.72 --> 3803.64]  May I pray this morning
[3803.64 --> 3804.56]  For them
[3804.56 --> 3805.12]  But also
[3805.12 --> 3807.82]  For those we often do not pray for
[3807.82 --> 3810.38]  For retail workers
[3810.38 --> 3812.22]  And retail owners
[3812.22 --> 3812.98]  Shop owners
[3812.98 --> 3813.56]  For
[3813.56 --> 3814.94]  Lord God
[3814.94 --> 3815.70]  For truck drivers
[3815.70 --> 3817.28]  For pilots
[3817.28 --> 3819.14]  For hospitality workers
[3819.14 --> 3821.38]  For seafarers
[3821.38 --> 3824.26]  For many many months
[3824.26 --> 3826.40]  Stuck on board a ship
[3826.40 --> 3827.74]  Never be able to get off
[3827.74 --> 3830.72]  Because of regulations
[3830.72 --> 3832.56]  Lord God
[3832.56 --> 3833.60]  We pray for all those
[3833.60 --> 3835.16]  Who have lost their jobs
[3835.16 --> 3837.20]  But there is great
[3837.20 --> 3839.78]  Insecurity
[3839.78 --> 3841.06]  And not being sure
[3841.06 --> 3842.92]  When maybe a job
[3842.92 --> 3843.82]  Will ever come back
[3843.82 --> 3846.28]  Lord God
[3846.28 --> 3846.92]  We heard this morning
[3846.92 --> 3847.56]  From the Psalms
[3847.56 --> 3848.38]  That you are the God
[3848.38 --> 3849.12]  Of justice
[3849.12 --> 3849.98]  And righteousness
[3849.98 --> 3852.22]  Lord
[3852.22 --> 3854.72]  If all the things
[3854.72 --> 3855.42]  That are going on
[3855.42 --> 3856.60]  Also in terms of
[3856.60 --> 3859.38]  Peace demonstrations
[3859.38 --> 3861.40]  And all the
[3861.40 --> 3863.54]  Demonstrations
[3863.54 --> 3864.50]  That are going on
[3864.50 --> 3866.10]  Lord God
[3866.10 --> 3867.18]  You have called us
[3867.18 --> 3869.22]  To be the church
[3869.22 --> 3869.92]  In darkness
[3869.92 --> 3871.76]  Like the prophets
[3871.76 --> 3873.46]  You call us
[3873.46 --> 3874.66]  Salt and light
[3874.66 --> 3876.68]  And so you give us
[3876.68 --> 3877.46]  That responsibility
[3877.46 --> 3878.34]  May we do that
[3878.34 --> 3879.32]  Faithfully
[3879.32 --> 3882.46]  Knowing that it's not
[3882.46 --> 3883.26]  Always easy
[3883.26 --> 3885.34]  But you give us
[3885.34 --> 3886.86]  Guidance through your word
[3886.86 --> 3888.30]  And through your spirit
[3888.30 --> 3890.80]  Lord God
[3890.80 --> 3891.74]  We pray for your church
[3891.74 --> 3892.78]  Here in Ladner
[3892.78 --> 3893.52]  And worldwide
[3893.52 --> 3894.56]  We thank you Lord
[3894.56 --> 3894.90]  For
[3894.90 --> 3896.90]  In these difficult times
[3896.90 --> 3898.38]  That you are still with us
[3898.38 --> 3899.70]  That you will never leave us
[3899.70 --> 3901.20]  Not your church either
[3901.20 --> 3901.64]  And that
[3901.64 --> 3903.08]  We hope to start
[3903.08 --> 3903.66]  A new ministry
[3903.66 --> 3904.58]  Again in this church
[3904.58 --> 3905.26]  With Nancy
[3905.26 --> 3907.22]  And we praise you for that
[3907.22 --> 3907.80]  We pray Lord
[3907.80 --> 3908.58]  For Pastor Jason
[3908.58 --> 3909.30]  And his family
[3909.30 --> 3910.50]  For the council
[3910.50 --> 3911.44]  And again Lord
[3911.44 --> 3913.26]  For the leadership
[3913.26 --> 3914.26]  And
[3914.26 --> 3915.82]  We long Lord
[3915.82 --> 3916.14]  Again
[3916.14 --> 3917.02]  For worshipping
[3917.02 --> 3918.04]  Together
[3918.04 --> 3919.66]  And praising your name
[3919.66 --> 3921.78]  Lord God
[3921.78 --> 3922.78]  We pray for the mission
[3922.78 --> 3923.64]  Of your church
[3923.64 --> 3925.60]  For the psalmist
[3925.60 --> 3927.00]  Also tells us
[3927.00 --> 3928.70]  That all the nations
[3928.70 --> 3929.74]  You have made
[3929.74 --> 3931.12]  Will come
[3931.12 --> 3932.64]  And worship
[3932.64 --> 3933.72]  Before you
[3933.72 --> 3936.84]  For the Lord
[3936.84 --> 3938.10]  They will bring glory
[3938.10 --> 3939.14]  To your name
[3939.14 --> 3940.42]  What an incredible promise
[3940.42 --> 3940.90]  That is
[3940.90 --> 3941.74]  And we have
[3941.74 --> 3942.58]  That promise
[3942.58 --> 3944.26]  And we trust in your promise
[3944.26 --> 3945.06]  And so Lord God
[3945.06 --> 3945.56]  Be with
[3945.56 --> 3947.58]  All the churches
[3947.58 --> 3948.62]  And all the ministries
