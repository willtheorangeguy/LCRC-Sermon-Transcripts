[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[62.00 --> 64.00]  Thank you.
[64.00 --> 77.66]  Good morning.
[79.28 --> 80.16]  Good morning.
[80.64 --> 81.90]  Sorry about that glitch.
[82.00 --> 85.84]  We had a little technical difficulty this morning, but here we are, ready to worship
[85.84 --> 86.38]  with you.
[86.38 --> 91.96]  We welcome you to this online worship service of Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[92.72 --> 98.94]  The current COVID-19 pandemic prevents us from meeting together physically as a congregation,
[99.26 --> 105.62]  but it does not prevent us from taking this time to gather together virtually to worship
[105.62 --> 107.26]  our triune God.
[107.26 --> 112.42]  If you are joining us for the first time as a visitor, we welcome you.
[113.72 --> 117.84]  On this Palm Sunday, we worship the living God.
[118.72 --> 125.26]  Today we remember Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the beginning of Holy Week,
[125.80 --> 129.66]  the week of Christ's passion and his death on the cross.
[129.66 --> 136.58]  Our worship service will proceed with Angela and Andreas Larson presenting the music for
[136.58 --> 137.20]  this service.
[137.82 --> 140.70]  Don Vendriel and Doug Van Rine, our technical people.
[141.66 --> 146.82]  Pastor Jason Truel bringing us God's word and myself, Bev Banstra as worship leader.
[146.82 --> 153.80]  In an effort to make it easy for you to sing the hymns with us, we will project only the words.
[154.54 --> 157.14]  And we have included some songs the children know.
[157.46 --> 162.04]  So kids, please show your parents the actions to these songs as you sing them.
[162.62 --> 168.08]  And kids, be sure to get paper and markers ready to draw a picture during the sermon.
[168.86 --> 172.14]  And perhaps tomorrow you could mail your picture to your grandparents.
[172.40 --> 174.06]  I'm sure they miss you very much.
[174.06 --> 182.28]  Whether you are alone at this moment or sitting with family members, God will hear our praise
[182.28 --> 182.98]  and petitions.
[183.68 --> 186.88]  And we will together hear his words for us today.
[187.96 --> 191.56]  Wherever you are, God is with each one of us.
[192.24 --> 196.66]  He promised this to his covenant people and we claim that promise today.
[197.82 --> 199.68]  A word about our songs today.
[199.68 --> 206.46]  Our first hymn, All Glory, Laud, and Honor, is the quintessential Palm Sunday hymn.
[207.24 --> 214.96]  The Latin text was written in the 9th century, 1,200 years ago, by Theodulf of Orleans in France
[214.96 --> 216.02]  while he was in prison.
[217.06 --> 224.78]  John Neal wrote the English translation in the mid-1880s and it is set to a majestic 17th
[224.78 --> 226.44]  century German tune.
[228.04 --> 232.52]  As Moses Raised the Serpent Up is an old English American folk song.
[233.12 --> 239.92]  And we end our service today with the Old Hundred, the melody written by Louis Bourgeois in 1551
[240.08 --> 241.32]  for the Geneva Psalter.
[241.32 --> 248.28]  Our offering today is for World Renew, which is a branch of our denomination that works
[248.28 --> 255.50]  to end global poverty with food security, peace and justice, economic livelihood,
[255.50 --> 258.64]  and health in more than 30 developing countries.
[259.70 --> 265.00]  Our congregants received a newsletter this past week telling them how they can submit their offerings
[265.00 --> 265.70]  and pledges.
[266.12 --> 267.10]  Please look at that.
[267.10 --> 275.12]  Let's take a moment of stillness to prepare our hearts for worship and God's word.
[276.42 --> 280.02]  Invite God to speak to you during this worship service.
[291.74 --> 293.36]  Hear this call to worship.
[293.36 --> 296.16]  Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion.
[296.64 --> 298.92]  Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem.
[299.88 --> 301.48]  Lo, your king comes to you.
[301.90 --> 309.34]  Triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
[311.20 --> 313.02]  God greets us with these words.
[314.02 --> 320.54]  God our Father gave his Son to take the form of a servant and to be obedient, even to death
[320.54 --> 321.22]  on a cross.
[322.18 --> 329.36]  May God give us the same mind of Christ Jesus, so that sharing in his humility, we may come
[329.36 --> 331.30]  to be with him in his glory.
[331.30 --> 336.30]  O glory, Lord, and honour to your indeed.
[336.30 --> 349.78]  O glory, Lord, and honour to your redeemer, King.
[349.78 --> 363.26]  O glory, Lord, and honour to your redeemer, King.
[363.26 --> 372.22]  To whom the lips of children, praise sweet hosanna's ring.
[372.22 --> 381.54]  You are the king of Israel and David's royal son.
[381.54 --> 390.90]  Now in the Lord's name come you, the king and blessed one.
[390.90 --> 409.80]  The company of angels is praising you on all, and we with all creation in chorus make me run.
[409.80 --> 419.70]  The people of the Hebrews, with all's before you wait.
[419.70 --> 428.38]  Our praise and prayer and anthems before you be present.
[428.38 --> 439.06]  To you, Lord, and we with all creation, we sing the hymns of praise.
[439.06 --> 448.44]  To you now, the exalted, our melody we raise.
[448.44 --> 457.78]  As I sing the praises, except the praise we bring.
[457.78 --> 467.90]  For you delight in goodness, O good and gracious King.
[467.90 --> 470.90]  Every sentiment, Lord, and we sing the hymn noise.
[470.90 --> 471.90]  Give Operating.
[471.90 --> 473.42]  The church is a king or new God.
[473.42 --> 476.64]  The church is a heavenly cha avec nous.

[497.90 --> 502.24]  So glad He came to save us
[502.24 --> 505.16]  He came from heaven to earth
[505.16 --> 509.58]  Through shadow and the empty glass
[509.58 --> 513.52]  But after all, He blessed Him
[513.52 --> 516.22]  And He came from heaven to earth
[516.22 --> 519.78]  Lord, I lift Your name on hand
[519.78 --> 525.90]  Lord, I lift Your name on hand
[525.90 --> 530.40]  I've got the same praises
[530.40 --> 534.90]  There in my life
[534.90 --> 539.36]  So God came to save us
[539.36 --> 542.02]  He came from heaven to earth
[542.02 --> 546.44]  Through shadow and the empty glass
[546.44 --> 550.36]  And after all, He blessed Him
[550.36 --> 551.14]  And He blessed Him
[551.14 --> 553.08]  And He blessed Him
[553.08 --> 557.50]  through He blessed Him
[557.50 --> 561.36]  And He blessed Him
[561.36 --> 591.34]  Thank you.
[591.36 --> 599.34]  I'm going to read a passage of the Bible that tells what happens when Jesus rides into Jerusalem, the big capital city.
[600.26 --> 603.98]  So I have a question for you. Have you ever seen a parade?
[604.88 --> 610.68]  Well, one of my family's favorite things to do in the summer is go to the Canada Day Parade.
[610.68 --> 621.44]  And it's very exciting for all of us because there are so many people there and there are floats that go down the street and people like to wave something on Canada Day.
[621.78 --> 625.98]  Do you know what it is? It's a little Canadian flag.
[626.12 --> 627.90]  Just like this. And they like to wave it.
[628.90 --> 633.88]  Well, when Jesus came into Jerusalem, it was sort of like a big parade.
[633.88 --> 637.12]  And it was a parade just for Jesus.
[637.78 --> 639.72]  So let me ask you a question.
[640.06 --> 646.24]  If you were an important person like a king, how would you ride in a parade?
[646.24 --> 653.60]  I think if it was me, I would want to be in a very cool, fancy sports car.
[654.12 --> 656.74]  I mean, if I had to do something, that might be a good way to do it.
[657.80 --> 663.10]  But did Jesus ride through town on a float or in a fancy car?
[663.10 --> 666.58]  No, he came on a donkey.
[667.36 --> 676.32]  That was very unusual, but it was very important because it showed us that he was coming humbly and in peace.
[676.96 --> 679.72]  A donkey isn't a big, mighty war horse.
[680.14 --> 685.74]  It's just an ordinary animal that many people would have at their homes to help them to do work or to travel.
[685.74 --> 693.64]  Now, while Jesus came riding into Jerusalem, people lined up all along the street to welcome him.
[694.08 --> 699.52]  They put their coats on the ground to make like a red carpet for him to walk down.
[700.18 --> 706.02]  This showed that they respected Jesus and they considered him to be their king.
[706.62 --> 711.78]  And they also waved palm branches, sort of like you might wave this flag at a parade.
[711.78 --> 715.10]  And the palm branches showed that it was a celebration.
[715.74 --> 718.36]  And it was also a sign of victory.
[718.82 --> 722.56]  Jesus came as the king to conquer all their enemies.
[723.78 --> 727.02]  And while they were celebrating, the people also shouted something.
[727.48 --> 728.42]  Do you know what it was?
[729.18 --> 731.26]  They hollered, Hosanna!
[731.98 --> 734.34]  It means God save us.
[734.92 --> 737.94]  The people wanted Jesus to save them.
[738.38 --> 740.84]  And they knew that he was able to do it.
[740.84 --> 749.92]  You know, in the Bible, some of the Pharisees told Jesus to have the people quiet down, to not make such a fuss.
[750.72 --> 759.16]  But Jesus said, if the people don't call out and praise, the rocks themselves would cry out to praise him.
[760.02 --> 763.26]  But I don't think we should let the rocks have all the fun.
[763.52 --> 766.78]  I think we should also praise God.
[766.78 --> 770.18]  So I want to have your help.
[770.52 --> 771.54]  I'm going to ask you.
[771.82 --> 773.02]  Well, I'm going to count down.
[773.10 --> 776.12]  I'm going to say, one, two, three.
[776.48 --> 778.96]  And then I want you to shout, Hosanna!
[779.86 --> 780.38]  Okay?
[780.56 --> 782.06]  So let's try it together.
[782.34 --> 782.82]  Are you ready?
[783.98 --> 786.74]  One, two, three.
[787.54 --> 788.14]  Hosanna!
[789.42 --> 790.30]  Good job.
[790.60 --> 791.60]  So let's pray together.
[791.60 --> 798.64]  Dear God, we thank you for sending Jesus to be our king.
[799.14 --> 802.02]  We thank you that he came to save us.
[802.68 --> 808.34]  And we ask that you would help us to praise you and to worship you as our king.
[808.86 --> 810.60]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[811.28 --> 811.68]  Amen.
[811.68 --> 811.86]  Amen.
[821.60 --> 843.80]  Thank you.
[845.84 --> 845.96]  Amen.
[845.96 --> 864.02]  The sun is, the sun is, the sun is in the house.
[864.02 --> 871.82]  The sun is, the sun is in the house.
[871.82 --> 880.14]  I lend them to the��s, the sun is in the house.
[880.14 --> 896.28]  The sun is, the sun is bright, the sunshine is with clase, Language two 있죠 shade.
[896.28 --> 926.26]  Thank you.
[926.28 --> 931.88]  Please join me for this prayer of confession.
[932.22 --> 935.54]  There will be a time of personal confession at the end of this prayer.
[937.76 --> 942.12]  Jesus, our Lord, we shout hosannas to praise you.
[942.92 --> 947.88]  With eager hands, we place our cloaks and palms on the path before you.
[948.60 --> 956.94]  Yet, Lord, we confess that the mouths that seek to praise you often deny or defy you.
[957.58 --> 963.04]  And we confess that the hands that seek to serve you often become fists.
[964.12 --> 966.98]  Lord, hear us as we confess.
[966.98 --> 967.98]  Amen.
[982.38 --> 985.94]  Hear these words of assurance and please read the bold.
[985.94 --> 989.24]  Hosanna to the son of David.
[989.78 --> 992.70]  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[994.00 --> 1000.76]  For Christ came into the world not to condemn the world, but that the world through him should be saved.
[1000.76 --> 1009.56]  Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children.
[1011.40 --> 1017.48]  And walk in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us.
[1017.78 --> 1022.30]  A fragrant offering and a sacrifice to God.
[1022.94 --> 1023.46]  Hosanna.
[1024.22 --> 1024.48]  Amen.
[1024.48 --> 1025.20]  Hosanna.
[1049.58 --> 1051.10]  Hosanna.
[1051.10 --> 1059.10]  The second time, so must God's son be left alive.
[1060.36 --> 1071.36]  And who's alone, he will believe in the name of each one of you.
[1071.36 --> 1082.94]  And who lost your love, he will be made. He gave his own, he loved his son.
[1082.94 --> 1089.20]  And who will believe in the name of each one of you.
[1089.52 --> 1094.94]  And who died and lived forevermore.
[1094.94 --> 1101.36]  Who did not send praise to the world.
[1102.08 --> 1107.08]  He gave his name, and now must love.
[1107.08 --> 1113.16]  My love, my cross, so dearly.
[1113.16 --> 1118.96]  My only one, so long, no one.
[1118.96 --> 1123.48]  My love, my cross, so long, no one.
[1123.48 --> 1130.16]  He gave his own, he loved his son.
[1130.16 --> 1138.10]  And who will believe in the name of each one of you.
[1138.10 --> 1142.10]  And who died and died forevermore.
[1142.10 --> 1158.86]  Well, good morning, friends.
[1160.50 --> 1162.20]  Thank you for joining us.
[1163.16 --> 1168.28]  And today we're going to continue in our study in the Gospel of Mark.
[1168.90 --> 1170.36]  Today is Palm Sunday.
[1170.36 --> 1172.80]  It's the first day of Holy Week.
[1173.84 --> 1177.98]  And on Palm Sunday, we remember that Jesus rode into Jerusalem.
[1178.74 --> 1184.72]  And the reason that he came to this great city is he came to die on a cross.
[1185.14 --> 1188.74]  Just as he had told his followers that he would do.
[1190.04 --> 1195.14]  So today we will read the triumphal entry from the Gospel of Mark.
[1195.14 --> 1199.44]  It's in Mark chapter 11, verses 1 through 11.
[1199.44 --> 1202.26]  And we will have the verses up on the screen.
[1211.92 --> 1215.98]  Okay, so please prepare your hearts for the reading of God's word.
[1215.98 --> 1222.84]  As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives,
[1223.60 --> 1227.48]  Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them,
[1228.00 --> 1233.12]  Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there,
[1233.48 --> 1235.08]  which no one has ever ridden.
[1235.82 --> 1237.38]  Untie it and bring it here.
[1237.38 --> 1241.06]  If anyone asks you, why are you doing this?
[1241.06 --> 1246.50]  Say, the Lord needs it, and will send it back here shortly.
[1246.86 --> 1251.38]  They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway.
[1251.98 --> 1254.94]  As they untied it, some people standing there asked,
[1255.16 --> 1257.58]  What are you doing untying that colt?
[1257.58 --> 1263.66]  They answered as Jesus had told them, and the people let them go.
[1264.36 --> 1269.26]  When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.
[1269.90 --> 1275.64]  Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
[1276.46 --> 1279.12]  Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted,
[1279.62 --> 1283.56]  Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[1283.56 --> 1287.28]  Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David.
[1287.98 --> 1290.14]  Hosanna in the highest heaven.
[1291.48 --> 1295.98]  Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.
[1296.62 --> 1300.78]  He looked around at everything, but since it was already late,
[1301.14 --> 1304.30]  he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
[1304.84 --> 1306.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1307.36 --> 1308.78]  Thanks be to God.
[1309.62 --> 1310.86]  Let's pray together.
[1313.56 --> 1317.98]  Our heavenly father, we come before you wherever we are.
[1318.78 --> 1321.64]  We come and we lift our hearts to you.
[1322.08 --> 1324.76]  We bring you, Lord, our lives.
[1325.22 --> 1326.68]  We bring you our families.
[1327.14 --> 1329.22]  We bring you all of our concerns and our worries.
[1330.46 --> 1336.32]  So Lord, we ask that even now this morning, through technology,
[1336.98 --> 1338.48]  that you would speak to us.
[1338.48 --> 1340.94]  That you would speak to us with your word.
[1341.08 --> 1343.80]  That you would show us clearly who you are.
[1344.42 --> 1348.04]  And that we would be comforted in knowing that you are our king.
[1348.62 --> 1349.98]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1350.58 --> 1350.86]  Amen.
[1353.70 --> 1359.16]  So over spring break, my family and I watched The Lord of the Rings.
[1359.22 --> 1360.62]  We watched all three movies,
[1360.62 --> 1365.08]  and even some of the extras on the DVD.
[1366.08 --> 1373.28]  Well, there's a part in The Lord of the Rings where the city of Gondor is ruled by a steward.
[1373.98 --> 1376.16]  The steward's name is Denethor.
[1377.16 --> 1380.02]  So Denethor is the ruler of the city,
[1380.58 --> 1386.46]  but the people of Gondor are waiting for their true king to return.
[1386.46 --> 1396.02]  Denethor's job as steward is to maintain the city and to keep it until the rightful king comes back.
[1397.36 --> 1400.48]  And when you look in the great hall of the palace,
[1400.74 --> 1402.56]  you see a magnificent throne,
[1403.14 --> 1405.72]  but the throne is empty.
[1406.46 --> 1409.42]  And at the foot of the throne is a simple black chair,
[1409.80 --> 1412.12]  and that is where the steward sits.
[1412.12 --> 1415.86]  So Denethor is steward of Gondor,
[1416.18 --> 1421.24]  but he doesn't like the idea of a king coming back.
[1421.78 --> 1424.78]  Because he knows that when the king returns,
[1425.32 --> 1427.54]  he will have to give up his power.
[1427.96 --> 1430.38]  He will have to relinquish the throne.
[1431.44 --> 1433.30]  So eventually Denethor dies,
[1433.42 --> 1434.92]  and his younger son, Faramir,
[1435.04 --> 1437.84]  becomes the new steward of Gondor.
[1437.84 --> 1442.52]  But right when Faramir becomes the new steward of Gondor,
[1442.72 --> 1446.02]  Aragorn, the rightful king of Gondor, arrives.
[1447.22 --> 1448.62]  And so the question is,
[1449.50 --> 1450.94]  what will Faramir do?
[1451.88 --> 1453.82]  Will he be like his father?
[1454.38 --> 1456.92]  Will he spurn the coming of the king?
[1457.40 --> 1461.86]  Or will he kneel down and bow before him?
[1461.86 --> 1467.38]  So Tolkien writes and tells us that Faramir met Aragorn
[1467.38 --> 1470.06]  in the midst of the assembly and of all the people,
[1470.74 --> 1472.80]  and he kneels before him and says,
[1473.52 --> 1478.06]  the last steward of Gondor begs leave to surrender his office.
[1479.36 --> 1482.40]  And then Faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice,
[1483.24 --> 1484.32]  men of Gondor,
[1484.98 --> 1489.96]  behold, one has come to claim the kingship again at last.
[1489.96 --> 1492.38]  Here is Aragorn.
[1492.92 --> 1496.22]  Shall he be king and enter the city and dwell there?
[1497.06 --> 1498.94]  And all the people cried,
[1499.32 --> 1501.56]  yea, with one voice.
[1502.40 --> 1504.68]  It's a beautiful scene in the story.
[1505.46 --> 1508.00]  And the reason I'm sharing it with you this morning,
[1508.68 --> 1511.78]  or wherever or whenever you are watching this,
[1512.56 --> 1515.84]  is that each one of us is faced with the same question.
[1515.84 --> 1519.96]  Behold, you have a king.
[1520.64 --> 1522.30]  He has come to you.
[1522.96 --> 1524.32]  And the question is,
[1524.94 --> 1525.98]  who will you be?
[1526.86 --> 1529.48]  Will you be Denethor and reject him?
[1530.02 --> 1533.46]  Or will you be Faramir and receive him?
[1535.14 --> 1536.84]  So consider this.
[1537.88 --> 1539.90]  Two thousand years ago,
[1539.90 --> 1545.12]  one man rode into one city on a donkey.
[1546.14 --> 1549.98]  But today in cities all over the world,
[1550.60 --> 1552.68]  there are about two billion people
[1552.68 --> 1554.90]  who worship the King Jesus.
[1555.70 --> 1557.38]  And they gather this morning.
[1557.48 --> 1558.96]  They call it Palm Sunday.
[1559.58 --> 1560.88]  And on this Palm Sunday,
[1560.88 --> 1564.40]  they celebrate his triumphal entry into that city.
[1564.40 --> 1569.18]  And we consider it to be the most important week
[1569.18 --> 1570.70]  in all of human history.
[1571.76 --> 1573.18]  It's called the triumphal entry
[1573.18 --> 1578.62]  because Jesus entered Jerusalem that day as king.
[1579.02 --> 1580.80]  The king of his people.
[1581.18 --> 1583.02]  The king of the whole world.
[1583.98 --> 1586.18]  You know, the prophet Zechariah in the Old Testament
[1586.18 --> 1587.72]  foretold that this would happen
[1587.72 --> 1589.50]  as we read in our call to worship.
[1590.26 --> 1590.84]  It says,
[1590.84 --> 1604.76]  And so Holy Week begins with a declaration.
[1605.90 --> 1607.10]  You have a king.
[1607.82 --> 1611.16]  You have a king and he has come to you.
[1612.10 --> 1614.96]  So how will we respond to him?
[1616.18 --> 1617.00]  And so this morning,
[1617.00 --> 1620.04]  we want to consider the triumphal entry of the king
[1620.04 --> 1624.56]  and what it means for us to receive Jesus as king
[1624.56 --> 1625.86]  in our own lives.
[1627.10 --> 1629.70]  So we're going to look at three things this morning.
[1630.08 --> 1633.10]  We're going to look at what it means to receive Jesus as king.
[1633.62 --> 1636.82]  And that it is to receive his lordship in our lives.
[1637.06 --> 1640.28]  It is to receive his agenda.
[1641.10 --> 1644.88]  And it also means that we respond in worship to him.
[1646.04 --> 1647.50]  So let's look at this together.
[1647.50 --> 1650.70]  The first thing to say is that when the king comes,
[1650.82 --> 1652.82]  you receive him as king.
[1652.90 --> 1654.42]  You receive his lordship.
[1655.64 --> 1657.32]  So in our passage,
[1657.72 --> 1660.14]  here's the background of what's going on.
[1660.58 --> 1661.22]  It's Sunday,
[1661.96 --> 1664.44]  and the week coming for the Jewish people
[1664.44 --> 1665.88]  is Passover week.
[1666.60 --> 1667.76]  So in Jerusalem,
[1668.42 --> 1669.70]  on a normal day,
[1669.82 --> 1671.86]  there would be about 30,000 people
[1671.86 --> 1672.92]  who live in the city.
[1672.92 --> 1675.90]  But during the festival of Passover,
[1676.44 --> 1679.50]  that population would swell.
[1680.04 --> 1682.52]  The people from all over Israel
[1682.52 --> 1684.66]  would travel to Jerusalem
[1684.66 --> 1685.90]  to celebrate the Passover.
[1686.94 --> 1687.96]  And so everyone
[1687.96 --> 1690.06]  is coming to Jerusalem.
[1690.96 --> 1692.04]  And during the festival,
[1692.70 --> 1694.88]  there would be upwards of 200
[1694.88 --> 1697.04]  or even 300,000 people
[1697.04 --> 1698.34]  there in the city.
[1698.34 --> 1701.28]  And so Jesus and his disciples
[1701.28 --> 1702.90]  are also coming to Jerusalem.
[1703.60 --> 1706.26]  And they're coming as part of this great pilgrimage
[1706.26 --> 1708.76]  for the festival of Passover.
[1709.74 --> 1712.64]  But it's not only Jesus and his disciples
[1712.64 --> 1713.42]  who are coming.
[1714.20 --> 1716.48]  There's a crowd that is following Jesus.
[1717.50 --> 1718.74]  And so the question might be,
[1718.86 --> 1720.16]  where did this crowd come from?
[1720.70 --> 1721.92]  Well, these are people
[1721.92 --> 1724.00]  who have seen Jesus
[1724.00 --> 1725.54]  perform all of his miracles.
[1726.06 --> 1728.20]  And they have been fed by Jesus.
[1728.66 --> 1729.92]  And they have heard
[1729.92 --> 1732.06]  Jesus teach them.
[1732.92 --> 1734.12]  And so they are following him.
[1734.14 --> 1734.76]  They're following him
[1734.76 --> 1735.86]  wherever he goes.
[1737.30 --> 1738.32]  And so as Jesus
[1738.32 --> 1740.56]  has a crowd with him,
[1740.80 --> 1742.08]  they're all coming
[1742.08 --> 1743.26]  into the city together.
[1744.32 --> 1746.04]  And as they approach the city,
[1746.20 --> 1747.38]  they get to what is called
[1747.38 --> 1748.48]  the Mount of Olives.
[1749.10 --> 1750.38]  Now the Mount of Olives
[1750.38 --> 1752.22]  is on the east side of Jerusalem.
[1752.82 --> 1754.86]  And it's about 250 feet
[1754.86 --> 1756.08]  higher than the city.
[1756.64 --> 1757.44]  So when you stand
[1757.44 --> 1758.40]  on the Mount of Olives,
[1758.78 --> 1759.98]  you see the whole city
[1759.98 --> 1761.08]  of Jerusalem before you.
[1761.62 --> 1763.04]  And especially the temple
[1763.04 --> 1765.26]  right there in front of you
[1765.26 --> 1766.14]  in the east of the city.
[1767.26 --> 1768.10]  And so it's here
[1768.10 --> 1769.22]  that Jesus stops.
[1770.08 --> 1770.88]  And he says
[1770.88 --> 1772.14]  to two of his disciples
[1772.14 --> 1772.88]  in verse 2,
[1773.76 --> 1774.74]  he says to them,
[1775.46 --> 1777.02]  go to the village ahead of you,
[1777.88 --> 1778.54]  Bethpage,
[1778.54 --> 1780.52]  and just as you enter it,
[1780.56 --> 1781.60]  you will find a colt,
[1781.96 --> 1783.52]  which is a young donkey.
[1784.80 --> 1786.40]  The colt will be tied there,
[1786.80 --> 1788.30]  which no one has ever ridden.
[1789.02 --> 1790.64]  Untie it and bring it here.
[1791.32 --> 1792.44]  If anyone asks you,
[1792.60 --> 1793.76]  why are you doing this?
[1793.88 --> 1794.18]  Say,
[1794.66 --> 1795.76]  the Lord needs it.
[1796.12 --> 1797.84]  And we'll send it back here shortly.
[1799.44 --> 1800.72]  So that's the setting.
[1800.72 --> 1802.24]  Now let's try to imagine
[1802.24 --> 1804.48]  what's going on here.
[1804.48 --> 1806.72]  Jesus says,
[1807.78 --> 1808.88]  I'm the Lord
[1808.88 --> 1811.72]  and I need this donkey.
[1812.60 --> 1814.16]  And when he refers to himself
[1814.16 --> 1815.02]  as the Lord,
[1815.24 --> 1816.58]  what he's saying is,
[1817.16 --> 1818.00]  I'm the king.
[1818.60 --> 1818.84]  Right?
[1818.96 --> 1821.54]  I am God.
[1822.24 --> 1823.42]  I am the creator.
[1823.92 --> 1825.74]  I am the owner of everything.
[1825.74 --> 1830.18]  And so imagine what these two disciples
[1830.18 --> 1831.78]  must have been thinking.
[1832.38 --> 1833.86]  Because Jesus tells them
[1833.86 --> 1834.82]  to do something here
[1834.82 --> 1835.92]  that would seem
[1835.92 --> 1837.72]  a little bit strange.
[1838.94 --> 1840.22]  Maybe they were thinking
[1840.22 --> 1841.18]  this to themselves.
[1841.86 --> 1842.64]  Maybe they're thinking,
[1842.88 --> 1843.82]  okay, so Jesus,
[1843.94 --> 1844.88]  let us get this straight.
[1845.68 --> 1847.00]  We're supposed to go
[1847.00 --> 1847.86]  into a village
[1847.86 --> 1850.18]  and we're going to find a donkey.
[1851.00 --> 1852.42]  And when we find it,
[1852.48 --> 1853.68]  we're supposed to
[1853.68 --> 1854.92]  take it?
[1855.52 --> 1856.90]  Isn't that called stealing?
[1858.36 --> 1859.68]  But we tell the owner,
[1859.90 --> 1860.98]  oh, you need it.
[1861.78 --> 1862.72]  And he's just going to
[1862.72 --> 1863.36]  let us take it
[1863.36 --> 1864.04]  just like that.
[1865.76 --> 1867.18]  And Jesus, by the way,
[1867.30 --> 1868.22]  what's going on
[1868.22 --> 1869.32]  with the donkey anyway?
[1870.26 --> 1871.66]  Jesus never rides around
[1871.66 --> 1872.30]  on a donkey
[1872.30 --> 1874.04]  or horses or anything.
[1874.04 --> 1874.50]  I mean,
[1874.62 --> 1876.18]  we're always walking.
[1876.48 --> 1877.98]  So why does he want a donkey?
[1880.22 --> 1881.84]  They have all of these questions.
[1881.92 --> 1883.36]  It's a very strange request.
[1883.68 --> 1885.80]  But verse 4 simply says,
[1886.68 --> 1887.16]  they went.
[1888.06 --> 1889.08]  It doesn't say
[1889.08 --> 1889.90]  they asked Jesus
[1889.90 --> 1890.64]  all these questions,
[1890.74 --> 1891.92]  they demanded an explanation.
[1892.60 --> 1893.24]  It just says,
[1893.40 --> 1893.96]  they went.
[1894.74 --> 1896.14]  They obeyed Jesus.
[1896.68 --> 1897.84]  They did what Jesus
[1897.84 --> 1898.76]  asked them to do.
[1899.24 --> 1900.76]  Even though probably
[1900.76 --> 1903.02]  they didn't understand why.
[1904.06 --> 1905.46]  So that's the disciples.
[1906.16 --> 1907.08]  Now let's think about
[1907.08 --> 1908.66]  the owner of the donkey.
[1908.66 --> 1911.00]  What was it like
[1911.00 --> 1911.80]  for the owner
[1911.80 --> 1913.58]  when these two guys
[1913.58 --> 1914.94]  show up at his house
[1914.94 --> 1916.40]  and start taking his donkey?
[1917.40 --> 1918.50]  So Max Lucado
[1918.50 --> 1920.44]  writes about this
[1920.44 --> 1921.32]  in one of his books.
[1921.48 --> 1922.56]  And here's what he says.
[1922.56 --> 1925.90]  When we all get to heaven,
[1926.12 --> 1927.82]  I know what I want to do.
[1928.40 --> 1929.04]  There's someone
[1929.04 --> 1930.28]  I want to get to know.
[1930.86 --> 1931.92]  I want to meet the guy
[1931.92 --> 1932.52]  with the donkey.
[1933.62 --> 1935.26]  I have several questions
[1935.26 --> 1935.82]  for him.
[1936.82 --> 1937.76]  Did you know?
[1938.44 --> 1939.76]  Did you know it was Jesus
[1939.76 --> 1940.82]  who needed a donkey?
[1941.72 --> 1942.88]  Did you have a vision?
[1943.72 --> 1944.90]  Did you get a telegram?
[1945.54 --> 1946.92]  Did an angel appear
[1946.92 --> 1948.00]  in your bowl of lentils?
[1948.00 --> 1951.38]  Was it hard to give?
[1952.48 --> 1953.72]  Was it difficult
[1953.72 --> 1954.74]  to give something
[1954.74 --> 1955.56]  to Jesus
[1955.56 --> 1957.18]  for him to use?
[1958.20 --> 1959.92]  I want to ask that question
[1959.92 --> 1960.64]  because sometimes
[1960.64 --> 1961.62]  it's hard for me.
[1962.74 --> 1963.98]  Sometimes I like to keep
[1963.98 --> 1965.40]  my animals to myself.
[1966.52 --> 1967.58]  Sometimes when God
[1967.58 --> 1968.36]  wants something,
[1969.00 --> 1970.20]  I act like
[1970.20 --> 1971.40]  I don't know
[1971.40 --> 1972.20]  that he needs it.
[1974.44 --> 1975.96]  And so what does this mean
[1975.96 --> 1976.68]  for us today?
[1976.68 --> 1978.84]  Here's the takeaway.
[1979.44 --> 1980.30]  That when you
[1980.30 --> 1981.68]  encounter the king,
[1982.24 --> 1983.88]  you receive him
[1983.88 --> 1986.22]  because he is Lord.
[1987.34 --> 1988.10]  And so just like
[1988.10 --> 1988.72]  the disciples,
[1988.94 --> 1989.78]  when he tells you
[1989.78 --> 1990.48]  to do something,
[1991.14 --> 1992.24]  you do it
[1992.24 --> 1995.02]  because he is your king.
[1996.26 --> 1997.18]  And like the owner
[1997.18 --> 1997.86]  of the donkeys,
[1997.96 --> 1998.86]  when he asks you
[1998.86 --> 1999.70]  to give him something,
[2000.14 --> 2001.26]  you just give it
[2001.26 --> 2003.26]  because it's his.
[2003.36 --> 2004.76]  He owns everything.
[2004.76 --> 2007.30]  When Jesus comes
[2007.30 --> 2008.24]  to us as king,
[2008.96 --> 2009.20]  you know,
[2009.26 --> 2010.40]  he comes to us
[2010.40 --> 2011.54]  as our savior,
[2011.78 --> 2012.18]  yes,
[2012.88 --> 2013.90]  but he also comes
[2013.90 --> 2015.42]  to us as our Lord.
[2015.98 --> 2017.42]  And you can't separate
[2017.42 --> 2018.66]  those two realities.
[2019.48 --> 2019.92]  Right?
[2019.96 --> 2020.62]  You can't say,
[2020.70 --> 2020.86]  you know,
[2020.94 --> 2022.14]  I believe in Jesus
[2022.14 --> 2023.20]  and I'm so glad
[2023.20 --> 2024.24]  that he has saved me.
[2024.58 --> 2025.62]  He has made me
[2025.62 --> 2026.20]  his child.
[2026.32 --> 2026.96]  He has given me
[2026.96 --> 2027.72]  the Holy Spirit
[2027.72 --> 2028.82]  to dwell within me.
[2028.82 --> 2030.50]  But I don't need
[2030.50 --> 2031.44]  to do what he says.
[2032.20 --> 2032.60]  Right?
[2032.66 --> 2033.40]  I accept Jesus
[2033.40 --> 2034.18]  as my savior,
[2034.70 --> 2035.88]  but I don't need
[2035.88 --> 2036.52]  to receive him
[2036.52 --> 2037.74]  as the Lord of my life.
[2038.64 --> 2039.36]  And this passage
[2039.36 --> 2040.04]  tells us
[2040.04 --> 2041.64]  that you can't do that.
[2042.26 --> 2043.06]  That it doesn't
[2043.06 --> 2043.86]  work like that.
[2044.58 --> 2045.52]  So I want to give you
[2045.52 --> 2046.92]  an illustration of this
[2046.92 --> 2047.84]  and I'm going to pick
[2047.84 --> 2049.04]  on Peter Klumps,
[2049.88 --> 2051.02]  who many of you know
[2051.02 --> 2051.68]  and I asked him
[2051.68 --> 2052.72]  ahead of time
[2052.72 --> 2053.60]  and he gave me permission.
[2054.56 --> 2055.68]  So Peter's name
[2055.68 --> 2056.64]  is Peter Klumps.
[2056.64 --> 2058.06]  So let's say
[2058.06 --> 2058.98]  I want to go out
[2058.98 --> 2059.52]  and I want to have
[2059.52 --> 2061.02]  coffee with Peter.
[2061.46 --> 2062.64]  So if I say,
[2063.10 --> 2064.10]  come on Peter,
[2064.20 --> 2065.08]  let's go get coffee,
[2065.88 --> 2066.82]  but Klumps,
[2067.10 --> 2068.14]  you're not invited.
[2069.12 --> 2069.86]  That's going to be
[2069.86 --> 2070.98]  very difficult for him
[2070.98 --> 2072.90]  because it's not like
[2072.90 --> 2074.34]  he has a Peter part
[2074.34 --> 2075.76]  and a Klumps part.
[2076.48 --> 2078.00]  He's all Peter
[2078.00 --> 2079.36]  and he's all Klumps.
[2079.68 --> 2080.44]  So if I want to have
[2080.44 --> 2081.50]  coffee with him,
[2081.66 --> 2082.74]  I've got to have
[2082.74 --> 2083.40]  all of him
[2083.40 --> 2085.30]  or none of him at all.
[2085.30 --> 2087.20]  In the same way,
[2087.32 --> 2088.16]  you can't say,
[2088.50 --> 2088.66]  you know,
[2088.74 --> 2089.00]  Jesus,
[2089.18 --> 2090.04]  I receive you
[2090.04 --> 2091.04]  as my Savior,
[2091.70 --> 2093.52]  but I don't want you
[2093.52 --> 2094.30]  to be my Lord.
[2094.96 --> 2095.18]  Right?
[2095.22 --> 2095.94]  You can't say,
[2096.44 --> 2097.56]  come in the helper
[2097.56 --> 2098.90]  of my life,
[2098.98 --> 2100.18]  but stay out
[2100.18 --> 2101.46]  as king.
[2101.58 --> 2102.70]  I will be king
[2102.70 --> 2103.58]  of my own life.
[2104.54 --> 2105.44]  It's either
[2105.44 --> 2106.46]  all of him
[2106.46 --> 2107.54]  or nothing.
[2108.44 --> 2109.26]  And it means
[2109.26 --> 2109.86]  that there can't be
[2109.86 --> 2111.30]  any part of your life
[2111.30 --> 2112.46]  that you don't let him
[2112.46 --> 2113.72]  have authority over.
[2113.72 --> 2115.56]  There can't be
[2115.56 --> 2117.64]  any part of his word,
[2117.74 --> 2118.26]  the Bible,
[2118.36 --> 2119.18]  where you say,
[2119.78 --> 2121.22]  I'll obey this part,
[2121.48 --> 2122.74]  but I don't like
[2122.74 --> 2124.18]  what that part says.
[2124.98 --> 2126.42]  So when Jesus comes
[2126.42 --> 2127.04]  as king,
[2127.32 --> 2128.74]  you receive him.
[2128.82 --> 2129.76]  You obey him.
[2129.84 --> 2130.78]  You do what he says
[2130.78 --> 2132.06]  and give what he asks
[2132.06 --> 2134.68]  because he is the Lord.
[2136.16 --> 2137.86]  So that's our first point.
[2138.00 --> 2139.22]  And the second thing
[2139.22 --> 2140.06]  we see here
[2140.06 --> 2141.54]  is that when Jesus
[2141.54 --> 2142.46]  comes as king,
[2142.46 --> 2144.68]  you receive his agenda.
[2146.38 --> 2148.06]  So all the people
[2148.06 --> 2149.60]  understand
[2149.60 --> 2152.28]  that Jesus is king.
[2152.94 --> 2154.44]  That's why the crowds
[2154.44 --> 2155.54]  lay their cloaks
[2155.54 --> 2156.40]  on the road.
[2156.40 --> 2157.82]  It symbolized
[2157.82 --> 2158.92]  their acceptance
[2158.92 --> 2160.04]  of Jesus as king.
[2161.06 --> 2163.08]  And they cut palm branches.
[2163.80 --> 2164.66]  That's why we call it
[2164.66 --> 2165.22]  Palm Sunday.
[2165.54 --> 2166.86]  They cut these palm branches
[2166.86 --> 2168.44]  and they lay them down
[2168.44 --> 2169.18]  before him.
[2169.18 --> 2170.92]  The palm branch
[2170.92 --> 2172.66]  symbolizes
[2172.66 --> 2175.14]  the Jewish nation.
[2175.14 --> 2176.98]  It symbolizes victory.
[2177.92 --> 2178.94]  And that is what
[2178.94 --> 2180.00]  is going on here
[2180.00 --> 2181.48]  is that the people,
[2181.70 --> 2182.96]  they thought that Jesus
[2182.96 --> 2184.38]  was coming in victory.
[2184.96 --> 2185.88]  They're celebrating.
[2186.00 --> 2187.30]  The king has come.
[2187.82 --> 2188.92]  They thought he was
[2188.92 --> 2189.68]  going to kick out
[2189.68 --> 2190.20]  the Romans.
[2190.66 --> 2192.22]  That he would liberate
[2192.22 --> 2193.20]  Israel from this
[2193.20 --> 2194.02]  foreign oppression.
[2194.96 --> 2196.66]  That he would restore
[2196.66 --> 2199.16]  Israel to national sovereignty.
[2200.48 --> 2201.30]  They missed,
[2201.48 --> 2202.00]  they understood
[2202.00 --> 2203.50]  that Jesus was a king,
[2203.86 --> 2205.72]  but they missed something
[2205.72 --> 2207.18]  in Zechariah's prophecy.
[2208.04 --> 2209.16]  Zechariah says,
[2209.94 --> 2210.42]  behold,
[2210.58 --> 2211.56]  your king is coming
[2211.56 --> 2212.22]  to you
[2212.22 --> 2213.54]  humble
[2213.54 --> 2215.10]  and mounted
[2215.10 --> 2216.40]  on a donkey.
[2217.58 --> 2218.40]  He says,
[2218.46 --> 2219.22]  your real king
[2219.22 --> 2219.84]  is coming,
[2220.62 --> 2221.72]  but he's coming
[2221.72 --> 2222.68]  to you humble.
[2222.68 --> 2224.50]  He will be
[2224.50 --> 2226.16]  a shepherd king.
[2226.52 --> 2227.80]  He will be a king
[2227.80 --> 2228.92]  who cares
[2228.92 --> 2230.48]  for his people.
[2232.08 --> 2232.22]  You know,
[2232.28 --> 2233.34]  Zechariah wants us
[2233.34 --> 2233.74]  to know
[2233.74 --> 2234.28]  that Jesus
[2234.28 --> 2234.84]  is coming
[2234.84 --> 2235.72]  to Jerusalem
[2235.72 --> 2238.16]  not on a big,
[2238.28 --> 2239.52]  strong battle horse
[2239.52 --> 2240.92]  as a conquering king,
[2241.44 --> 2242.60]  but he's coming
[2242.60 --> 2243.26]  on a donkey
[2243.26 --> 2244.52]  showing the humility
[2244.52 --> 2245.40]  of his heart.
[2246.36 --> 2247.44]  And he's riding
[2247.44 --> 2248.28]  into Jerusalem
[2248.28 --> 2249.04]  not to
[2249.04 --> 2250.08]  kick out
[2250.08 --> 2250.72]  the Romans
[2250.72 --> 2251.68]  and wield
[2251.68 --> 2252.36]  a sword,
[2252.68 --> 2253.56]  but to
[2253.56 --> 2254.34]  lay down
[2254.34 --> 2255.08]  his life.
[2256.32 --> 2256.90]  He's coming
[2256.90 --> 2257.46]  not just
[2257.46 --> 2258.02]  to be the
[2258.02 --> 2259.48]  savior of Israel,
[2259.80 --> 2260.42]  but to be
[2260.42 --> 2260.98]  the savior
[2260.98 --> 2262.30]  of the entire world.
[2263.38 --> 2264.14]  So when Jesus
[2264.14 --> 2264.88]  comes and he's
[2264.88 --> 2265.72]  riding on a donkey,
[2265.88 --> 2266.42]  he's saying,
[2266.96 --> 2267.26]  yes,
[2267.30 --> 2268.22]  I'm a king,
[2268.80 --> 2270.02]  but I'm not a king
[2270.02 --> 2270.82]  like you think.
[2271.98 --> 2273.12]  He wasn't coming
[2273.12 --> 2274.06]  to defeat
[2274.06 --> 2274.66]  the Romans,
[2274.90 --> 2276.56]  their physical enemies.
[2277.20 --> 2278.16]  He was coming
[2278.16 --> 2278.80]  to defeat
[2278.80 --> 2279.88]  their spiritual enemies.
[2280.52 --> 2281.36]  He was coming
[2281.36 --> 2282.60]  to defeat
[2282.60 --> 2283.34]  sin
[2283.34 --> 2284.74]  and death
[2284.74 --> 2285.52]  and Satan.
[2286.54 --> 2287.32]  Enemies that
[2287.32 --> 2287.88]  the people
[2287.88 --> 2288.62]  didn't think
[2288.62 --> 2289.68]  that they necessarily
[2289.68 --> 2290.88]  needed to be saved from.
[2292.74 --> 2293.60]  So friends,
[2293.66 --> 2294.54]  what does this tell us?
[2294.58 --> 2295.28]  It tells us that
[2295.28 --> 2296.28]  our agenda
[2296.28 --> 2297.08]  for Jesus
[2297.08 --> 2298.90]  often looks
[2298.90 --> 2299.96]  similar to the crowds.
[2300.96 --> 2301.12]  You know,
[2301.16 --> 2301.98]  when he comes
[2301.98 --> 2303.26]  into our lives,
[2303.60 --> 2305.10]  we often have
[2305.10 --> 2305.52]  an agenda
[2305.52 --> 2306.06]  for him.
[2306.64 --> 2306.88]  You know,
[2306.94 --> 2307.50]  we want him
[2307.50 --> 2308.08]  to come
[2308.08 --> 2309.56]  and take care
[2309.56 --> 2310.50]  of the physical.
[2311.60 --> 2312.54]  Our wants,
[2313.16 --> 2313.84]  our needs,
[2313.94 --> 2314.66]  our desires.
[2315.54 --> 2316.10]  This is how
[2316.10 --> 2316.98]  my life should go.
[2317.08 --> 2317.80]  This is the person
[2317.80 --> 2318.52]  I want to marry.
[2318.88 --> 2319.50]  This is how many
[2319.50 --> 2320.38]  children I want.
[2320.54 --> 2321.56]  I want this job
[2321.56 --> 2322.36]  and this promotion.
[2322.98 --> 2324.04]  And we come to him
[2324.04 --> 2325.14]  with our plan
[2325.14 --> 2326.26]  for our life.
[2327.28 --> 2328.46]  And when our life
[2328.46 --> 2329.10]  doesn't go
[2329.10 --> 2330.32]  the way we want,
[2331.32 --> 2332.84]  we question the king.
[2333.60 --> 2333.96]  We say,
[2334.08 --> 2334.36]  Jesus,
[2334.36 --> 2336.26]  why aren't you
[2336.26 --> 2337.26]  on board here?
[2337.88 --> 2338.78]  Don't you see
[2338.78 --> 2340.62]  that this is the plan
[2340.62 --> 2341.38]  I have
[2341.38 --> 2342.46]  for us to do?
[2343.10 --> 2343.36]  You know,
[2343.42 --> 2344.04]  don't you
[2344.04 --> 2345.36]  care about me?
[2345.66 --> 2346.48]  You're not giving me
[2346.48 --> 2347.26]  what I want.
[2347.26 --> 2348.38]  It's making me question.
[2350.02 --> 2350.28]  You know,
[2350.36 --> 2350.84]  but Jesus
[2350.84 --> 2352.30]  has a different agenda.
[2353.24 --> 2353.98]  He comes
[2353.98 --> 2355.42]  not to
[2355.42 --> 2356.48]  give us the life
[2356.48 --> 2357.18]  that we imagine
[2357.18 --> 2357.84]  for ourselves,
[2357.90 --> 2358.36]  but he comes
[2358.36 --> 2359.34]  for our heart.
[2360.00 --> 2360.78]  He comes
[2360.78 --> 2361.70]  to
[2361.70 --> 2363.30]  forgive our sins.
[2363.30 --> 2364.46]  He comes
[2364.46 --> 2364.98]  to give us
[2364.98 --> 2365.80]  a new heart,
[2365.88 --> 2367.24]  a heart to love him
[2367.24 --> 2368.64]  and love other people.
[2369.26 --> 2369.78]  He comes
[2369.78 --> 2370.28]  to make us
[2370.28 --> 2371.02]  his child
[2371.02 --> 2371.94]  and to be
[2371.94 --> 2373.02]  our heavenly father.
[2374.82 --> 2375.08]  You know,
[2375.16 --> 2376.52]  there's a great
[2376.52 --> 2378.46]  illustration of this
[2378.46 --> 2379.10]  right in
[2379.10 --> 2379.82]  John's Gospel.
[2380.62 --> 2382.00]  We read the story
[2382.00 --> 2382.80]  of Mary
[2382.80 --> 2383.42]  and Martha
[2383.42 --> 2384.18]  and Lazarus.
[2384.90 --> 2385.12]  You know,
[2385.20 --> 2386.02]  Mary and Martha
[2386.02 --> 2387.22]  were sisters
[2387.22 --> 2387.96]  and Lazarus
[2387.96 --> 2388.62]  was their brother.
[2389.98 --> 2391.04]  They were all
[2391.04 --> 2392.24]  dear friends
[2392.24 --> 2392.76]  to Jesus.
[2393.30 --> 2394.58]  But Lazarus
[2394.58 --> 2395.48]  fell ill
[2395.48 --> 2396.70]  and he was
[2396.70 --> 2397.42]  going to die.
[2397.54 --> 2398.16]  And so they send
[2398.16 --> 2399.02]  news to Jesus
[2399.02 --> 2400.38]  and tell him,
[2400.50 --> 2400.58]  look,
[2400.68 --> 2401.72]  Lazarus is sick.
[2402.18 --> 2402.92]  You need to
[2402.92 --> 2403.42]  come
[2403.42 --> 2404.26]  quickly.
[2405.30 --> 2406.22]  And the most
[2406.22 --> 2407.62]  fascinating thing
[2407.62 --> 2408.82]  in this passage
[2408.82 --> 2410.54]  is that it says
[2410.54 --> 2411.78]  because
[2411.78 --> 2413.78]  Jesus loved
[2413.78 --> 2414.66]  Mary and Martha,
[2415.44 --> 2416.40]  he waited
[2416.40 --> 2417.38]  two more days.
[2418.34 --> 2418.88]  I mean,
[2418.90 --> 2419.86]  just think about that.
[2419.86 --> 2422.58]  because he loved
[2422.58 --> 2422.98]  them,
[2423.86 --> 2424.76]  he didn't answer
[2424.76 --> 2425.58]  their request
[2425.58 --> 2426.08]  for help
[2426.08 --> 2426.64]  right away.
[2427.84 --> 2429.10]  Because he loved
[2429.10 --> 2429.44]  them,
[2430.12 --> 2430.94]  he made them
[2430.94 --> 2431.46]  wait.
[2432.48 --> 2432.96]  It's not that.
[2433.04 --> 2433.78]  That wasn't their plan.
[2433.86 --> 2434.72]  Their plan was for him
[2434.72 --> 2435.34]  to come quickly.
[2436.40 --> 2437.48]  Because he loved
[2437.48 --> 2437.86]  them,
[2438.82 --> 2439.78]  he let Lazarus
[2439.78 --> 2440.16]  die.
[2441.74 --> 2442.72]  And so they came
[2442.72 --> 2443.20]  to Jesus
[2443.20 --> 2443.90]  and do you know
[2443.90 --> 2445.00]  what their first words
[2445.00 --> 2445.96]  were to him?
[2445.96 --> 2446.94]  they said,
[2447.24 --> 2447.28]  Lord,
[2447.40 --> 2448.54]  if you had been
[2448.54 --> 2448.84]  here,
[2448.92 --> 2449.40]  my brother
[2449.40 --> 2449.88]  would not
[2449.88 --> 2450.60]  have died.
[2451.68 --> 2452.66]  If you had
[2452.66 --> 2453.18]  followed
[2453.18 --> 2454.80]  my agenda,
[2455.12 --> 2456.14]  then this bad
[2456.14 --> 2456.74]  thing would not
[2456.74 --> 2457.38]  have happened.
[2458.74 --> 2459.60]  But Jesus
[2459.60 --> 2460.92]  had a
[2460.92 --> 2461.42]  different
[2461.42 --> 2462.00]  and a
[2462.00 --> 2462.76]  better agenda.
[2463.18 --> 2463.74]  He could have
[2463.74 --> 2464.40]  come and healed
[2464.40 --> 2465.42]  Lazarus of his
[2465.42 --> 2465.70]  sickness.
[2466.20 --> 2466.62]  That would have
[2466.62 --> 2467.08]  been great.
[2467.98 --> 2468.74]  But instead,
[2469.04 --> 2469.62]  he wanted
[2469.62 --> 2470.58]  Mary and Martha
[2470.58 --> 2471.78]  and us
[2471.78 --> 2472.50]  reading this
[2472.50 --> 2472.88]  today,
[2473.38 --> 2474.14]  to know that
[2474.14 --> 2474.92]  he didn't just
[2474.92 --> 2475.62]  have the power
[2475.62 --> 2476.50]  to heal the sick.
[2477.24 --> 2478.06]  That he had
[2478.06 --> 2478.72]  the power
[2478.72 --> 2480.04]  to raise
[2480.04 --> 2480.58]  the dead.
[2482.00 --> 2482.28]  Jesus'
[2482.62 --> 2483.10]  agenda
[2483.10 --> 2484.40]  is
[2484.40 --> 2485.48]  always
[2485.48 --> 2486.30]  better
[2486.30 --> 2487.26]  than our
[2487.26 --> 2487.64]  own.
[2489.08 --> 2489.36]  You know,
[2489.42 --> 2490.04]  and here's the
[2490.04 --> 2491.10]  question for us.
[2491.94 --> 2492.18]  It's
[2492.18 --> 2493.58]  where do you
[2493.58 --> 2494.22]  and I
[2494.22 --> 2494.90]  in our own
[2494.90 --> 2495.40]  lives
[2495.40 --> 2497.12]  need to
[2497.12 --> 2497.96]  set our
[2497.96 --> 2498.44]  agenda
[2498.44 --> 2498.94]  aside?
[2500.38 --> 2500.62]  You know,
[2500.66 --> 2501.08]  when you look
[2501.08 --> 2501.78]  at your life,
[2501.92 --> 2502.92]  can you say,
[2504.02 --> 2504.90]  I have
[2504.90 --> 2505.34]  my own
[2505.34 --> 2505.82]  plans,
[2505.98 --> 2506.88]  but I
[2506.88 --> 2507.50]  know that
[2507.50 --> 2508.00]  whatever
[2508.00 --> 2508.94]  Jesus has
[2508.94 --> 2509.34]  in store
[2509.34 --> 2509.84]  for me
[2509.84 --> 2511.40]  is better
[2511.40 --> 2512.80]  than what
[2512.80 --> 2513.78]  I have
[2513.78 --> 2514.12]  in store
[2514.12 --> 2514.84]  for myself.
[2515.82 --> 2516.22]  You know,
[2516.28 --> 2516.60]  of course,
[2516.68 --> 2516.92]  Jesus'
[2517.16 --> 2517.66]  plan is
[2517.66 --> 2518.20]  often
[2518.20 --> 2519.16]  not what
[2519.16 --> 2519.60]  we would
[2519.60 --> 2520.06]  expect.
[2520.16 --> 2520.44]  It's not
[2520.44 --> 2520.76]  what we
[2520.76 --> 2521.16]  would ask
[2521.16 --> 2521.42]  for.
[2522.54 --> 2522.92]  Sometimes
[2522.92 --> 2523.56]  it leads
[2523.56 --> 2524.28]  to way
[2524.28 --> 2525.18]  more
[2525.18 --> 2525.96]  suffering
[2525.96 --> 2527.34]  than we
[2527.34 --> 2527.96]  would ever
[2527.96 --> 2528.68]  want for
[2528.68 --> 2529.36]  ourselves
[2529.36 --> 2530.08]  or for
[2530.08 --> 2530.64]  our loved
[2530.64 --> 2531.02]  ones.
[2531.80 --> 2532.60]  But it's
[2532.60 --> 2533.32]  his plan.
[2533.32 --> 2534.50]  And he
[2534.50 --> 2534.84]  knows
[2534.84 --> 2535.34]  better
[2535.34 --> 2536.42]  than we
[2536.42 --> 2536.68]  do
[2536.68 --> 2537.00]  what
[2537.00 --> 2537.22]  we
[2537.22 --> 2537.64]  need.
[2538.28 --> 2538.64]  What
[2538.64 --> 2539.34]  is good
[2539.34 --> 2540.24]  for us
[2540.24 --> 2540.80]  ultimately?
[2541.16 --> 2542.58]  What will
[2542.58 --> 2543.40]  turn our
[2543.40 --> 2544.02]  hearts more
[2544.02 --> 2544.64]  to him?
[2545.18 --> 2545.58]  And what
[2545.58 --> 2545.98]  will give
[2545.98 --> 2546.32]  him the
[2546.32 --> 2546.86]  most glory?
[2548.04 --> 2548.82]  So when
[2548.82 --> 2549.50]  we receive
[2549.50 --> 2549.82]  Jesus'
[2550.06 --> 2550.60]  agenda for
[2550.60 --> 2551.32]  our life
[2551.32 --> 2551.80]  and for
[2551.80 --> 2552.66]  our world,
[2553.36 --> 2554.08]  and when
[2554.08 --> 2554.68]  we trust
[2554.68 --> 2555.12]  in his
[2555.12 --> 2555.64]  purposes
[2555.64 --> 2556.58]  that they
[2556.58 --> 2557.22]  are good,
[2557.92 --> 2558.56]  that he
[2558.56 --> 2559.46]  loves us,
[2559.46 --> 2561.12]  then we
[2561.12 --> 2561.80]  will have
[2561.80 --> 2562.34]  comfort.
[2562.96 --> 2563.30]  We will
[2563.30 --> 2563.92]  have peace
[2563.92 --> 2564.24]  in our
[2564.24 --> 2564.76]  lives,
[2565.02 --> 2565.70]  and we
[2565.70 --> 2566.32]  will know
[2566.32 --> 2567.08]  that he
[2567.08 --> 2567.58]  is in
[2567.58 --> 2568.04]  charge,
[2568.82 --> 2569.28]  whatever
[2569.28 --> 2569.90]  comes.
[2570.98 --> 2571.56]  So that's
[2571.56 --> 2571.88]  the second
[2571.88 --> 2572.26]  thing we
[2572.26 --> 2572.56]  see.
[2572.90 --> 2573.18]  And we
[2573.18 --> 2573.58]  see not
[2573.58 --> 2574.04]  only,
[2574.38 --> 2574.62]  you know,
[2574.72 --> 2575.02]  that when
[2575.02 --> 2575.42]  he comes
[2575.42 --> 2575.86]  as king,
[2575.96 --> 2576.40]  that he
[2576.40 --> 2576.88]  comes as
[2576.88 --> 2577.42]  our lord,
[2577.88 --> 2578.30]  that he
[2578.30 --> 2578.82]  comes with
[2578.82 --> 2579.22]  his own
[2579.22 --> 2579.66]  agenda,
[2579.82 --> 2580.40]  often not
[2580.40 --> 2580.76]  what we
[2580.76 --> 2581.34]  would expect
[2581.34 --> 2581.90]  or ask.
[2582.82 --> 2583.34]  The third
[2583.34 --> 2583.68]  thing we
[2583.68 --> 2584.10]  see in this
[2584.10 --> 2585.46]  passage is
[2585.46 --> 2585.86]  that when
[2585.86 --> 2586.24]  the king
[2586.24 --> 2586.84]  comes,
[2587.48 --> 2588.20]  we worship.
[2588.20 --> 2589.36]  when the
[2589.36 --> 2590.18]  king comes,
[2590.90 --> 2591.48]  we worship
[2591.48 --> 2591.92]  him.
[2593.42 --> 2594.06]  And we
[2594.06 --> 2594.62]  see that in
[2594.62 --> 2595.16]  this passage.
[2595.28 --> 2595.52]  When the
[2595.52 --> 2596.80]  crowd begins
[2596.80 --> 2597.26]  to follow
[2597.26 --> 2598.00]  Jesus into
[2598.00 --> 2598.52]  Jerusalem,
[2598.68 --> 2598.82]  you know,
[2598.86 --> 2599.32]  they grab
[2599.32 --> 2599.80]  their palm
[2599.80 --> 2600.18]  branches,
[2601.00 --> 2601.34]  and they
[2601.34 --> 2602.10]  were all
[2602.10 --> 2603.36]  shouting out
[2603.36 --> 2603.74]  loud.
[2604.78 --> 2605.40]  They say,
[2605.82 --> 2606.40]  Hosanna,
[2607.08 --> 2607.74]  blessed is
[2607.74 --> 2608.22]  he who
[2608.22 --> 2608.86]  comes in
[2608.86 --> 2609.26]  the name
[2609.26 --> 2609.62]  of the
[2609.62 --> 2609.94]  Lord.
[2610.86 --> 2611.22]  Blessed
[2611.22 --> 2611.70]  is the
[2611.70 --> 2612.00]  coming
[2612.00 --> 2612.44]  kingdom
[2612.44 --> 2613.26]  of our
[2613.26 --> 2613.64]  father
[2613.64 --> 2614.18]  David.
[2614.98 --> 2615.62]  Hosanna
[2615.62 --> 2616.16]  in the
[2616.16 --> 2616.72]  highest
[2616.72 --> 2617.58]  heaven.
[2617.82 --> 2617.96]  They
[2617.96 --> 2618.28]  were
[2618.28 --> 2619.16]  praising
[2619.16 --> 2619.62]  Jesus.
[2620.02 --> 2620.22]  They
[2620.22 --> 2620.42]  were
[2620.42 --> 2620.82]  praising
[2620.82 --> 2621.34]  God.
[2622.78 --> 2623.24]  Now,
[2623.32 --> 2623.74]  the question
[2623.74 --> 2624.18]  is,
[2624.26 --> 2624.84]  how did
[2624.84 --> 2625.30]  they know
[2625.30 --> 2625.76]  to say
[2625.76 --> 2626.16]  this?
[2627.02 --> 2627.82]  Where did
[2627.82 --> 2628.36]  they get
[2628.36 --> 2628.82]  this kind
[2628.82 --> 2629.24]  of language?
[2630.30 --> 2630.86]  And the
[2630.86 --> 2631.46]  answer is,
[2631.50 --> 2631.84]  they got
[2631.84 --> 2632.10]  it from
[2632.10 --> 2632.38]  the Old
[2632.38 --> 2632.76]  Testament.
[2633.54 --> 2634.04]  They got
[2634.04 --> 2634.36]  it in
[2634.36 --> 2634.94]  particular
[2634.94 --> 2635.86]  from
[2635.86 --> 2636.38]  Psalm
[2636.38 --> 2637.26]  118.
[2637.70 --> 2637.98]  Psalm
[2637.98 --> 2638.82]  118 is
[2638.82 --> 2639.14]  a
[2639.14 --> 2639.90]  halal
[2639.90 --> 2640.42]  psalm.
[2640.50 --> 2640.82]  Halal
[2640.82 --> 2641.10]  means
[2641.10 --> 2641.70]  praise.
[2641.90 --> 2642.24]  So we
[2642.24 --> 2642.44]  say,
[2642.76 --> 2643.38]  hallelujah,
[2644.24 --> 2644.80]  praise,
[2645.20 --> 2645.78]  Yahweh.
[2646.56 --> 2647.16]  Hallelujah,
[2647.16 --> 2648.16]  praise God.
[2648.88 --> 2649.82]  So it's a
[2649.82 --> 2650.72]  praise psalm.
[2651.48 --> 2651.70]  And the
[2651.70 --> 2652.10]  people are
[2652.10 --> 2652.88]  praising Jesus
[2652.88 --> 2653.56]  as he
[2653.56 --> 2654.14]  enters into
[2654.14 --> 2654.50]  Jerusalem.
[2655.74 --> 2656.50]  So here
[2656.50 --> 2657.14]  is what
[2657.14 --> 2658.46]  the last
[2658.46 --> 2659.50]  few verses
[2659.50 --> 2660.14]  of Psalm
[2660.14 --> 2661.48]  118
[2661.48 --> 2662.40]  say.
[2664.00 --> 2664.70]  It says,
[2664.70 --> 2665.48]  blessed is
[2665.48 --> 2665.98]  he who
[2665.98 --> 2666.80]  comes
[2666.80 --> 2667.28]  in the
[2667.28 --> 2667.54]  name
[2667.54 --> 2667.84]  of the
[2667.84 --> 2668.14]  Lord.
[2668.92 --> 2669.26]  From
[2669.26 --> 2669.44]  the
[2669.44 --> 2669.80]  house
[2669.80 --> 2670.36]  of the
[2670.36 --> 2670.62]  Lord,
[2670.72 --> 2671.16]  Jerusalem,
[2671.58 --> 2672.40]  we bless
[2672.40 --> 2672.68]  you.
[2673.64 --> 2673.90]  The
[2673.90 --> 2674.56]  Lord is
[2674.56 --> 2675.14]  God,
[2675.38 --> 2676.18]  and he
[2676.18 --> 2676.78]  has made
[2676.78 --> 2677.32]  his light
[2677.32 --> 2678.14]  shine us.
[2678.94 --> 2679.26]  With
[2679.26 --> 2680.26]  bows in
[2680.26 --> 2680.86]  hand,
[2681.50 --> 2682.22]  join in
[2682.22 --> 2682.46]  the
[2682.46 --> 2683.04]  festal
[2683.04 --> 2683.80]  procession.
[2685.06 --> 2685.32]  You
[2685.32 --> 2685.78]  are my
[2685.78 --> 2686.20]  God,
[2686.28 --> 2686.56]  and I
[2686.56 --> 2687.04]  will praise
[2687.04 --> 2687.28]  you.
[2688.02 --> 2688.32]  You
[2688.32 --> 2688.82]  are my
[2688.82 --> 2689.30]  God,
[2689.74 --> 2690.44]  and I
[2690.44 --> 2691.12]  will exalt
[2691.12 --> 2691.38]  you.
[2692.02 --> 2692.30]  Give
[2692.30 --> 2692.88]  thanks to
[2692.88 --> 2693.40]  the Lord,
[2693.50 --> 2693.94]  for he
[2693.94 --> 2694.52]  is good.
[2695.20 --> 2695.46]  His
[2695.46 --> 2695.90]  love
[2695.90 --> 2696.58]  endures
[2696.58 --> 2697.04]  forever.
[2698.50 --> 2699.16]  So not
[2699.16 --> 2699.68]  only is
[2699.68 --> 2700.00]  Jesus
[2700.00 --> 2700.74]  riding into
[2700.74 --> 2701.28]  Jerusalem
[2701.28 --> 2702.20]  on a
[2702.20 --> 2702.56]  donkey,
[2702.70 --> 2702.96]  but he
[2702.96 --> 2703.62]  is riding
[2703.62 --> 2704.48]  in on
[2704.48 --> 2705.18]  the praises
[2705.18 --> 2705.62]  of his
[2705.62 --> 2705.96]  people.
[2706.78 --> 2707.18]  And they
[2707.18 --> 2707.74]  are singing
[2707.74 --> 2708.94]  Hosanna.
[2709.84 --> 2710.62]  What does
[2710.62 --> 2711.42]  Hosanna mean?
[2711.50 --> 2712.06]  It means
[2712.06 --> 2713.42]  save us.
[2714.86 --> 2715.18]  And so
[2715.18 --> 2715.80]  what is
[2715.80 --> 2716.18]  worship?
[2717.18 --> 2717.60]  Worship
[2717.60 --> 2718.08]  is a
[2718.08 --> 2718.84]  response
[2718.84 --> 2719.84]  to the
[2719.84 --> 2720.26]  saving
[2720.26 --> 2720.74]  work of
[2720.74 --> 2721.14]  the king.
[2721.80 --> 2722.22]  We're
[2722.22 --> 2722.90]  responding to
[2722.90 --> 2723.26]  the good
[2723.26 --> 2723.86]  news that
[2723.86 --> 2724.24]  Jesus
[2724.24 --> 2724.74]  comes
[2724.74 --> 2724.94]  to
[2724.94 --> 2725.22]  save
[2725.22 --> 2725.52]  us.
[2725.90 --> 2726.28]  That
[2726.28 --> 2726.48]  he
[2726.48 --> 2726.68]  is
[2726.68 --> 2726.98]  good
[2726.98 --> 2727.10]  and
[2727.10 --> 2727.24]  that
[2727.24 --> 2727.42]  his
[2727.42 --> 2727.86]  steadfast
[2727.86 --> 2728.18]  love
[2728.18 --> 2728.58]  endures
[2728.58 --> 2728.98]  forever.
[2729.68 --> 2730.14]  Not
[2730.14 --> 2730.60]  that we
[2730.60 --> 2730.80]  can
[2730.80 --> 2731.08]  save
[2731.08 --> 2731.60]  ourselves.
[2732.48 --> 2732.62]  In
[2732.62 --> 2732.92]  fact,
[2733.00 --> 2733.14]  the
[2733.14 --> 2733.44]  Bible
[2733.44 --> 2734.04]  says
[2734.04 --> 2734.68]  that
[2734.68 --> 2734.84]  we
[2734.84 --> 2735.40]  can't
[2735.40 --> 2735.68]  save
[2735.68 --> 2736.16]  ourselves.
[2736.92 --> 2737.28]  We
[2737.28 --> 2737.78]  need
[2737.78 --> 2738.06]  a
[2738.06 --> 2738.42]  king.
[2738.76 --> 2739.02]  We
[2739.02 --> 2739.22]  need
[2739.22 --> 2739.36]  a
[2739.36 --> 2739.52]  king
[2739.52 --> 2739.70]  to
[2739.70 --> 2740.02]  come.
[2741.14 --> 2741.58]  So
[2741.58 --> 2741.76]  the
[2741.76 --> 2742.00]  hymn
[2742.00 --> 2742.40]  writer
[2742.40 --> 2743.08]  Augustus
[2743.08 --> 2743.66]  Toplady
[2743.66 --> 2744.24]  says
[2744.24 --> 2744.64]  this.
[2744.76 --> 2744.86]  I
[2744.86 --> 2745.04]  think
[2745.04 --> 2745.24]  it's
[2745.24 --> 2745.58]  brilliant.
[2747.16 --> 2747.28]  He
[2747.28 --> 2747.56]  says,
[2747.56 --> 2748.28]  when Christ
[2748.28 --> 2748.74]  entered
[2748.74 --> 2749.02]  into
[2749.02 --> 2749.62]  Jerusalem,
[2750.50 --> 2751.06]  the people
[2751.06 --> 2751.92]  spread their
[2751.92 --> 2752.62]  garments in
[2752.62 --> 2753.00]  the way.
[2754.00 --> 2754.74]  When he
[2754.74 --> 2755.64]  enters into
[2755.64 --> 2756.82]  our hearts,
[2757.18 --> 2758.12]  we pull
[2758.12 --> 2758.92]  off our
[2758.92 --> 2759.28]  own
[2759.28 --> 2759.78]  righteousness
[2759.78 --> 2761.12]  and not
[2761.12 --> 2761.96]  only lay
[2761.96 --> 2763.02]  it under
[2763.02 --> 2763.94]  Christ's feet,
[2764.32 --> 2764.98]  but even
[2764.98 --> 2766.14]  trample upon
[2766.14 --> 2766.80]  it ourselves.
[2768.10 --> 2769.04]  I think that
[2769.04 --> 2769.54]  is such a
[2769.54 --> 2770.20]  vivid image.
[2771.30 --> 2771.52]  You know,
[2771.58 --> 2772.14]  the people
[2772.14 --> 2772.78]  who
[2772.78 --> 2773.22]  worship
[2773.22 --> 2774.64]  are the
[2774.64 --> 2774.98]  people
[2774.98 --> 2775.22]  who
[2775.22 --> 2775.96]  realize
[2775.96 --> 2776.92]  that
[2776.92 --> 2777.34]  they
[2777.34 --> 2777.98]  have
[2777.98 --> 2778.32]  no
[2778.32 --> 2778.84]  righteousness
[2778.84 --> 2779.36]  of their
[2779.36 --> 2779.62]  own,
[2780.20 --> 2780.72]  that
[2780.72 --> 2781.26]  they
[2781.26 --> 2781.78]  need
[2781.78 --> 2782.10]  a
[2782.10 --> 2782.44]  savior
[2782.44 --> 2783.50]  and
[2783.50 --> 2784.02]  only
[2784.02 --> 2784.66]  God
[2784.66 --> 2785.18]  can
[2785.18 --> 2785.56]  save
[2785.56 --> 2785.96]  us.
[2787.82 --> 2788.16]  And so
[2788.16 --> 2788.52]  let me
[2788.52 --> 2789.00]  end
[2789.00 --> 2789.84]  with this,
[2790.30 --> 2790.62]  thinking
[2790.62 --> 2791.34]  again of
[2791.34 --> 2791.86]  Lord of
[2791.86 --> 2792.26]  the Rings.
[2793.24 --> 2793.68]  There's
[2793.68 --> 2793.98]  another
[2793.98 --> 2794.52]  scene
[2794.52 --> 2795.74]  where
[2795.74 --> 2795.94]  the
[2795.94 --> 2796.36]  hobbit
[2796.36 --> 2796.90]  Pippin
[2796.90 --> 2797.76]  is
[2797.76 --> 2798.24]  standing
[2798.24 --> 2798.60]  in the
[2798.60 --> 2798.86]  gates
[2798.86 --> 2799.16]  of the
[2799.16 --> 2799.44]  city
[2799.44 --> 2799.66]  of
[2799.66 --> 2800.10]  Gondor
[2800.10 --> 2801.32]  and
[2801.32 --> 2801.48]  the
[2801.48 --> 2801.90]  enemy
[2801.90 --> 2802.90]  has
[2802.90 --> 2803.42]  come
[2803.42 --> 2803.66]  to
[2803.66 --> 2804.14]  destroy
[2804.14 --> 2804.40]  the
[2804.40 --> 2804.68]  city.
[2805.50 --> 2806.24]  And the
[2806.24 --> 2806.58]  enemy
[2806.58 --> 2806.90]  has
[2806.90 --> 2807.16]  entered
[2807.16 --> 2807.38]  the
[2807.38 --> 2807.74]  gates
[2807.74 --> 2807.90]  and
[2807.90 --> 2808.04]  is
[2808.04 --> 2808.26]  getting
[2808.26 --> 2808.64]  ready
[2808.64 --> 2808.92]  to
[2808.92 --> 2809.36]  defeat
[2809.36 --> 2809.82]  all
[2809.82 --> 2810.02]  the
[2810.02 --> 2810.34]  forces
[2810.34 --> 2810.58]  of
[2810.58 --> 2810.88]  good
[2810.88 --> 2811.62]  and
[2811.62 --> 2811.88]  all
[2811.88 --> 2812.18]  seems
[2812.18 --> 2812.70]  lost.
[2813.80 --> 2814.04]  And at
[2814.04 --> 2814.20]  that
[2814.20 --> 2814.44]  very
[2814.44 --> 2815.00]  moment
[2815.00 --> 2816.10]  Pippin
[2816.10 --> 2816.68]  hears
[2816.68 --> 2817.24]  off in
[2817.24 --> 2817.38]  the
[2817.38 --> 2817.90]  distance
[2817.90 --> 2818.56]  the
[2818.56 --> 2819.28]  sound
[2819.28 --> 2819.80]  of
[2819.80 --> 2820.02]  the
[2820.02 --> 2820.62]  horns
[2820.62 --> 2820.88]  of
[2820.88 --> 2821.02]  the
[2821.02 --> 2821.36]  riders
[2821.36 --> 2821.60]  of
[2821.60 --> 2822.02]  Rohan.
[2822.80 --> 2823.36]  And
[2823.36 --> 2823.68]  over
[2823.68 --> 2823.94]  the
[2823.94 --> 2824.34]  crest
[2824.34 --> 2824.52]  of
[2824.52 --> 2824.72]  the
[2824.72 --> 2825.12]  hill
[2825.12 --> 2825.84]  come
[2825.84 --> 2826.06]  the
[2826.06 --> 2826.42]  horses
[2826.42 --> 2826.72]  of
[2826.72 --> 2827.16]  Rohan
[2827.16 --> 2827.30]  and
[2827.30 --> 2827.42]  their
[2827.42 --> 2827.80]  fighters
[2827.80 --> 2828.50]  and
[2828.50 --> 2828.66]  they're
[2828.66 --> 2828.94]  led
[2828.94 --> 2829.28]  by the
[2829.28 --> 2829.54]  king
[2829.54 --> 2829.70]  of
[2829.70 --> 2830.12]  Rohan.
[2830.12 --> 2831.20]  They
[2831.20 --> 2831.56]  ride
[2831.56 --> 2831.80]  into
[2831.80 --> 2832.24]  battle
[2832.24 --> 2833.28]  and
[2833.28 --> 2833.78]  eventually
[2833.78 --> 2834.10]  the
[2834.10 --> 2834.44]  king
[2834.44 --> 2835.02]  rides
[2835.02 --> 2835.22]  to
[2835.22 --> 2835.38]  his
[2835.38 --> 2835.56]  own
[2835.56 --> 2835.92]  death.
[2836.94 --> 2837.44]  But
[2837.44 --> 2837.60]  they
[2837.60 --> 2838.02]  defeat
[2838.02 --> 2838.22]  the
[2838.22 --> 2838.52]  enemy
[2838.52 --> 2839.36]  and
[2839.36 --> 2839.52]  they
[2839.52 --> 2839.82]  win
[2839.82 --> 2840.02]  the
[2840.02 --> 2840.32]  battle.
[2841.86 --> 2842.10]  And
[2842.10 --> 2842.44]  Tolkien
[2842.44 --> 2842.98]  tells
[2842.98 --> 2843.38]  us
[2843.38 --> 2844.06]  that
[2844.06 --> 2844.20]  for
[2844.20 --> 2844.38]  the
[2844.38 --> 2844.64]  rest
[2844.64 --> 2844.82]  of
[2844.82 --> 2845.00]  his
[2845.00 --> 2845.46]  life
[2845.46 --> 2846.58]  whenever
[2846.58 --> 2847.18]  Pippin
[2847.18 --> 2847.90]  hears
[2847.90 --> 2848.40]  the
[2848.40 --> 2848.92]  sounds
[2848.92 --> 2849.16]  of
[2849.16 --> 2849.60]  horns
[2849.60 --> 2849.82]  in
[2849.82 --> 2849.96]  the
[2849.96 --> 2850.48]  distance
[2850.48 --> 2851.74]  he
[2851.74 --> 2852.34]  weeps.
[2852.98 --> 2853.86]  He
[2853.86 --> 2854.28]  weeps
[2854.28 --> 2855.12]  because
[2855.12 --> 2855.98]  he
[2855.98 --> 2856.48]  remembers.
[2857.42 --> 2857.66]  He
[2857.66 --> 2858.12]  remembers
[2858.12 --> 2858.84]  the
[2858.84 --> 2859.44]  salvation
[2859.44 --> 2859.78]  that
[2859.78 --> 2859.98]  was
[2859.98 --> 2860.54]  accomplished
[2860.54 --> 2861.70]  for
[2861.70 --> 2862.12]  him.
[2862.82 --> 2863.00]  That
[2863.00 --> 2863.88]  somebody
[2863.88 --> 2865.20]  rode
[2865.20 --> 2866.00]  to
[2866.00 --> 2866.60]  their
[2866.60 --> 2867.22]  death
[2867.22 --> 2868.26]  on
[2868.26 --> 2868.56]  his
[2868.56 --> 2869.10]  behalf.
[2870.68 --> 2870.88]  And
[2870.88 --> 2871.02]  so
[2871.02 --> 2871.40]  friends
[2871.40 --> 2871.74]  when
[2871.74 --> 2872.06]  we
[2872.06 --> 2872.62]  worship
[2872.62 --> 2873.22]  Jesus
[2873.22 --> 2874.72]  during
[2874.72 --> 2875.04]  this
[2875.04 --> 2875.38]  holy
[2875.38 --> 2875.82]  week
[2875.82 --> 2876.18]  as
[2876.18 --> 2876.38]  we
[2876.38 --> 2877.02]  come
[2877.02 --> 2877.20]  to
[2877.20 --> 2877.38]  Good
[2877.38 --> 2877.76]  Friday
[2877.76 --> 2878.90]  the
[2878.90 --> 2879.40]  horns
[2879.40 --> 2879.60]  are
[2879.60 --> 2880.08]  sounding
[2880.08 --> 2880.26]  in
[2880.26 --> 2880.36]  the
[2880.36 --> 2880.82]  distance.
[2881.66 --> 2881.98]  When
[2881.98 --> 2882.18]  we
[2882.18 --> 2882.52]  worship
[2882.52 --> 2883.02]  God
[2883.02 --> 2883.28]  it
[2883.28 --> 2883.58]  is
[2883.58 --> 2884.04]  in
[2884.04 --> 2884.68]  response
[2884.68 --> 2885.06]  to
[2885.06 --> 2885.24]  the
[2885.24 --> 2885.54]  one
[2885.54 --> 2885.70]  who
[2885.70 --> 2886.30]  rode
[2886.30 --> 2887.10]  into
[2887.10 --> 2887.52]  battle
[2887.52 --> 2888.30]  who
[2888.30 --> 2888.60]  rode
[2888.60 --> 2888.84]  into
[2888.84 --> 2889.38]  victory
[2889.38 --> 2890.00]  on
[2890.00 --> 2890.32]  a
[2890.32 --> 2890.68]  donkey
[2890.68 --> 2891.80]  and
[2891.80 --> 2891.94]  when
[2891.94 --> 2892.08]  he
[2892.08 --> 2892.56]  came
[2892.56 --> 2893.00]  he
[2893.00 --> 2893.60]  saved
[2893.60 --> 2894.04]  us
[2894.04 --> 2894.64]  from
[2894.64 --> 2895.04]  sin
[2895.04 --> 2895.22]  and
[2895.22 --> 2895.54]  death.
[2896.50 --> 2897.18]  Jesus
[2897.18 --> 2897.62]  rode
[2897.62 --> 2897.88]  into
[2897.88 --> 2898.32]  Jerusalem
[2898.32 --> 2898.56]  on
[2898.56 --> 2898.80]  Palm
[2898.80 --> 2899.24]  Sunday
[2899.24 --> 2900.62]  and
[2900.62 --> 2900.74]  he
[2900.74 --> 2901.14]  came

[2901.90 --> 2902.18]  Good
[2902.18 --> 2902.60]  Friday
[2902.60 --> 2903.32]  he
[2903.32 --> 2903.52]  would
[2903.52 --> 2903.94]  suffer
[2903.94 --> 2904.24]  and
[2904.24 --> 2904.54]  die
[2904.54 --> 2904.76]  on
[2904.76 --> 2904.90]  the
[2904.90 --> 2905.36]  cross
[2905.36 --> 2906.10]  and
[2906.10 --> 2906.26]  that
[2906.26 --> 2906.44]  he
[2906.44 --> 2906.66]  would
[2906.66 --> 2907.22]  conquer
[2907.22 --> 2907.70]  death
[2907.70 --> 2908.12]  dying
[2908.12 --> 2908.32]  in
[2908.32 --> 2908.48]  our

[2910.26 --> 2910.68]  Easter
[2910.68 --> 2911.10]  Sunday
[2911.10 --> 2912.06]  he
[2912.06 --> 2912.22]  would
[2912.22 --> 2912.80]  rise
[2912.80 --> 2913.74]  victorious
[2913.74 --> 2914.20]  over
[2914.20 --> 2914.40]  the
[2914.40 --> 2914.76]  grave

[3225.04 --> 3235.04]  Lord Jesus Christ, you from whom angels hide their faces, you made your way to be with us sinners.
[3235.04 --> 3243.04]  You are King of kings, yet you humbled yourself to bear our flesh.
[3243.04 --> 3250.04]  You shine with heavenly glory, yet you lowered yourself into our darkness.
[3250.04 --> 3261.04]  You glow with moral purity, yet you absorbed all our evil into your holy being and did not pass evil back.
[3261.04 --> 3279.04]  Lord Jesus Christ, we live in a frightening world menaced by a tiny virus we cannot see and cannot see coming.
[3279.04 --> 3289.72]  some we know are sick some we know have been sick some of us will be sick all of
[3289.72 --> 3300.96]  us are afraid of being sick Lord Jesus Christ Hosanna save us Lord Jesus Christ
[3300.96 --> 3306.62]  you entered our world as a helpless babe we pray today for the babies of the
[3306.62 --> 3314.34]  world who cannot do for themselves for the elderly who can now do so much less for
[3314.34 --> 3322.86]  themselves for people with disabilities for the unlettered the unheard the
[3322.86 --> 3330.26]  unmentioned the unmentionable we pray for those in our church family struggling
[3330.26 --> 3340.40]  with cancer and for our shut-ins many who cannot have visitors at this time Lord

[3354.50 --> 3361.68]  today dependent for life itself on blessed handouts look in mercy on their
[3361.68 --> 3368.30]  children stung to see their parents asking strangers for help turn to the strange
[3368.30 --> 3374.22]  turn the strangers into friends we pray and the camps into havens of relief all
[3374.22 --> 3380.72]  because your own people new exile and because you are the one in whom our
[3380.72 --> 3389.12]  hearts find their true home Lord Jesus Christ Savior of the world come into our

[3448.72 --> 3458.08]  Lord's blessing. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be
[3458.08 --> 3464.04]  gracious to you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.
