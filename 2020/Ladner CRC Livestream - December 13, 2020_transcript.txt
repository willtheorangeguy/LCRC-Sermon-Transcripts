[538.00 --> 540.00]  Thank you.
[540.00 --> 544.00]  Thank you.
[544.00 --> 550.82]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders,
[551.44 --> 558.10]  and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[558.78 --> 562.36]  Of the increase of his government and peace, there will be no end.
[574.00 --> 586.48]  From me to the earth you came, born into this world to stay,
[586.48 --> 596.48]  for God with us, Emmanuel, now we adore your name.
[596.48 --> 608.68]  Your name is stormed by your tower, your name is a shelter at no other,
[608.68 --> 621.50]  your name let the saints sing it louder, for nothing has the power to sing, but your name.
[626.48 --> 642.36]  Jesus, in your name we pray, come and fill our hearts today.
[642.36 --> 652.36]  Lord, give us strength to live for you, and glorify your name.
[653.36 --> 666.36]  Your name is a strong and mighty tower, your name is a shelter at no other, your name.
[666.36 --> 677.64]  Let the nations sing it louder, for nothing has the power to sing, but your name.
[677.64 --> 691.64]  Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, wonderful Counselor,
[691.64 --> 705.64]  with your name is a shelter at no other, your name is a shelter at no other, your name is a shelter at no other,
[705.64 --> 711.64]  There's a shelter like no other, your name
[711.64 --> 722.64]  Let the nations sing a power, for nothing has the power to say but your name
[722.64 --> 740.64]  God with us, Emmanuel, God with us, Emmanuel
[740.64 --> 750.64]  God with us, Emmanuel, now we are called your name
[770.64 --> 783.64]  On His blue is the bliss of the hungry, the thirsty, the blue sears
[783.64 --> 790.64]  The bliss is the bliss of the suffering, the blind
[790.64 --> 798.64]  Imagine a King who will come through the dry press
[798.64 --> 803.64]  And walk where I walk full of greatness
[803.64 --> 813.64]  And call me to His Son, just like a father and child
[813.64 --> 823.64]  Who knows, who knows the hopes that I've given or gotten
[823.64 --> 830.64]  Who comes, who comes to lead all the children
[830.64 --> 840.64]  Imagine a King who would come through the darkness
[840.64 --> 845.64]  And walk where I walk full of greatness
[845.64 --> 855.64]  And call me to His Son, just like a father and child
[855.64 --> 858.64]  And walk where I walk full of greatness
[858.64 --> 874.64]  On the first Sunday of Advent, we lit the candle of hope
[874.64 --> 889.64]  To represent God's love for us through the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ
[889.64 --> 892.64]  This morning we will light the candle of peace
[892.64 --> 894.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[894.64 --> 896.64]  We wake for God's promises of peace on earth and goodwill to all
[896.64 --> 901.64]  We pray that God's peace will break through our restless hearts
[901.64 --> 905.64]  And lead us to Bethlehem, where we can then celebrate our Savior's birth
[905.64 --> 907.64]  Now we will light the candle of peace
[907.64 --> 909.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[909.64 --> 911.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[911.64 --> 913.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[913.64 --> 916.64]  We will light the candle of罪
[916.64 --> 920.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[920.64 --> 922.64]  We pray that God's peace MCD France
[922.64 --> 928.64]  We will light the candle of peace
[932.64 --> 934.64]  While He will light the candle of peace
[934.64 --> 938.64]  We will light the candle of grace
[938.64 --> 941.64]  We may replace Him
[941.64 --> 959.72]  O Lord, the wondrous mystery
[959.72 --> 964.02]  In the dying of the need
[964.02 --> 968.74]  Be the theme of heaven's praises
[968.74 --> 972.24]  Of your frail humanity
[972.24 --> 977.66]  Seen our longing in our darkness
[977.66 --> 982.00]  Now the light of life has come
[982.00 --> 986.16]  Come to Christ, who will be sent
[986.16 --> 992.04]  To confess to what's the most
[992.04 --> 1001.96]  Come behold the wondrous mystery
[1001.96 --> 1006.30]  Be the perfect Son of man
[1006.30 --> 1010.68]  In His living, in His suffering
[1010.68 --> 1014.82]  Never trace your state of sin
[1014.82 --> 1019.48]  See the truth, Lord, the madam
[1019.48 --> 1024.20]  Now to save the hellbound man
[1024.20 --> 1028.44]  Christ the great and true fulfillment
[1028.44 --> 1033.44]  Of the law in Him we stand
[1033.44 --> 1040.28]  Please join in this prayer of confession
[1040.28 --> 1049.84]  Almighty and loving God, we confess that we put our trust in other gods
[1049.84 --> 1055.24]  We honor these gods alongside of you and in place of you
[1055.24 --> 1060.32]  As we look towards the coming of our Savior in this Advent season
[1060.32 --> 1062.48]  Help us to know and trust you
[1062.48 --> 1065.12]  As you reveal yourself in your word
[1065.12 --> 1067.00]  And in the coming of Jesus
[1067.00 --> 1069.58]  Who shows us your heart
[1069.58 --> 1073.78]  May we put all our confidence in you alone
[1073.78 --> 1077.52]  Looking to you for all good things
[1077.52 --> 1079.40]  With humility and patience
[1079.40 --> 1083.96]  May we love, fear, and honor you with all our hearts
[1083.96 --> 1086.96]  In Jesus' powerful name, amen
[1086.96 --> 1092.46]  Our words of assurance are from 1 Peter 2, verse 24
[1092.46 --> 1098.24]  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross
[1098.24 --> 1103.18]  So that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness
[1103.18 --> 1106.60]  By His wounds you have been healed
[1113.96 --> 1126.24]  And behold the wondrous mystery
[1126.24 --> 1130.62]  Christ the Lord upon the tree
[1130.62 --> 1135.30]  In this land of broken sinners
[1135.30 --> 1138.74]  There's the lamb in victory
[1138.74 --> 1143.74]  See the price of redemption
[1143.74 --> 1145.74]  See the price of redemption
[1145.74 --> 1148.36]  See the colors that are on
[1148.36 --> 1152.74]  Bringing places to glory
[1152.74 --> 1156.74]  Grace of wisdom, love and joy
[1156.74 --> 1167.74]  Come behold the wondrous mystery
[1167.74 --> 1172.02]  Sling by death of our own life
[1172.02 --> 1175.74]  Have no grateful, every strength
[1175.74 --> 1179.74]  Praise the Lord, He is alive
[1179.74 --> 1184.74]  What a fortest of deliverance
[1184.74 --> 1189.74]  How unwavering love
[1189.74 --> 1193.74]  Christ in power, O resurrected
[1193.74 --> 1197.74]  As we will be when He comes
[1197.74 --> 1202.74]  What a fortest of deliverance
[1202.74 --> 1206.74]  How unwavering love
[1206.74 --> 1209.74]  Christ in power, O resurrected
[1209.74 --> 1213.74]  Christ in power, O resurrected
[1213.74 --> 1219.74]  As we will be when He comes
[1219.74 --> 1221.74]  Christ in power, O resurrected
[1221.74 --> 1223.74]  As we will be when He comes
[1223.74 --> 1224.74]  Christ in power, O resurrected
[1224.74 --> 1226.74]  And He will be when He comes
[1226.74 --> 1227.74]  To live with Him
[1227.74 --> 1229.74]  For He will be when He comes
[1229.74 --> 1230.74]  To live with Him
[1230.74 --> 1231.74]  For He will be when He comes
[1231.74 --> 1232.74]  To live with Him
[1232.74 --> 1233.74]  For He will be when He comes
[1233.74 --> 1234.74]  To live with Him
[1234.74 --> 1236.74]  For He will be when He comes
[1236.74 --> 1237.74]  To live with Him
[1237.74 --> 1239.74]  Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[1239.74 --> 1241.74]  It's great to worship with you
[1241.74 --> 1244.74]  On this third week of Advent.
[1244.74 --> 1248.74]  And so we are in an Advent sermon series
[1248.74 --> 1250.74]  Looking at the first couple of chapters
[1250.74 --> 1253.74]  In the Gospel of Luke
[1253.74 --> 1254.74]  And we are considering together
[1254.74 --> 1257.74]  How Jesus, as the King,
[1257.74 --> 1261.74]  Comes and fulfills the deepest longings
[1261.74 --> 1264.74]  That we have as men, women and children
[1264.74 --> 1269.74]  Who are living in a weary world
[1269.74 --> 1274.74]  And so I wonder what you are longing for
[1274.74 --> 1275.74]  In this season
[1275.74 --> 1279.74]  Well the first week we looked at the story
[1279.74 --> 1282.74]  Of Zechariah and Elizabeth
[1282.74 --> 1285.74]  And our longing for joy
[1285.74 --> 1287.74]  That when this child comes
[1287.74 --> 1289.74]  It would not only be for Elizabeth's joy
[1289.74 --> 1292.74]  But would be for the joy of all the people.
[1292.74 --> 1294.74]  And last week we looked at the story
[1294.74 --> 1297.74]  Of the angel Gabriel visiting Mary
[1297.74 --> 1300.74]  It's called the Annunciation
[1300.74 --> 1304.74]  And we saw that God in visiting Mary
[1304.74 --> 1309.74]  Showed her His grace and favor
[1309.74 --> 1312.74]  And so we looked at our longing for grace
[1312.74 --> 1314.74]  And in our passage today
[1314.74 --> 1315.74]  What we see here
[1315.74 --> 1319.74]  Is the longing that we all have for mercy
[1319.74 --> 1322.74]  We long for God's mercy
[1322.74 --> 1324.74]  And friends, the good news
[1324.74 --> 1327.74]  Is that we worship a merciful God
[1327.74 --> 1330.74]  Lamentations chapter 3
[1330.74 --> 1331.74]  Understands this well
[1331.74 --> 1332.74]  It says
[1332.74 --> 1334.74]  The steadfast love of the Lord
[1334.74 --> 1336.74]  Never ceases
[1336.74 --> 1340.74]  His mercies never come to an end
[1340.74 --> 1342.74]  They are new every morning
[1342.74 --> 1344.74]  Great is your faithfulness
[1344.74 --> 1347.74]  And so with that
[1347.74 --> 1348.74]  Thinking about God's mercies
[1348.74 --> 1350.74]  Let's read our passage for today
[1350.74 --> 1351.74]  And we'll have it up on the screen
[1351.74 --> 1353.74]  We're looking at Luke chapter 1
[1353.74 --> 1355.74]  Verses 46 to 55
[1355.74 --> 1359.74]  And I'll read it for us
[1359.74 --> 1361.74]  And Mary said
[1361.74 --> 1364.74]  My soul glorifies the Lord
[1364.74 --> 1367.74]  My spirit rejoices in God my Savior
[1367.74 --> 1370.74]  For He has been mindful of the humble state
[1370.74 --> 1372.74]  Of His servant
[1372.74 --> 1375.74]  From now on all generations will call me blessed
[1375.74 --> 1378.74]  For the mighty one has done great things for me
[1378.74 --> 1380.74]  Holy is His name
[1380.74 --> 1394.74]  Sorry, my slide clicker is not going
[1394.74 --> 1395.74]  Doug, can you get me here?
[1398.74 --> 1401.74]  His mercy extends to those who fear Him
[1401.74 --> 1403.74]  From generation to generation
[1403.74 --> 1406.74]  He has performed mighty deeds with His arm
[1406.74 --> 1409.74]  He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts
[1409.74 --> 1411.74]  He has brought down rulers from their thrones
[1411.74 --> 1414.74]  But has lifted up the humble
[1416.74 --> 1418.74]  He has filled the hungry with good things
[1418.74 --> 1420.74]  But has sent the rich away
[1420.74 --> 1422.74]  He has helped His servant Israel
[1422.74 --> 1424.74]  Remembering to be merciful
[1424.74 --> 1427.74]  To Abraham and his descendants forever
[1427.74 --> 1430.74]  Just as He promised our ancestors
[1430.74 --> 1433.74]  This is the word of the Lord
[1433.74 --> 1436.74]  Thanks be to God
[1436.74 --> 1437.74]  Thanks
[1437.74 --> 1439.74]  Let's pray together
[1439.74 --> 1441.74]  Our Heavenly Father
[1441.74 --> 1442.74]  We
[1442.74 --> 1444.74]  In this
[1444.74 --> 1446.74]  Weary world that we live in
[1447.74 --> 1449.74]  Lord we come before you
[1450.74 --> 1451.74]  As our merciful God
[1451.74 --> 1453.74]  And Lord because
[1453.74 --> 1456.74]  You have shown yourself to be merciful
[1456.74 --> 1458.74]  And you have in your word
[1458.74 --> 1460.74]  Told us of your mercy to your people
[1461.74 --> 1462.74]  So Lord we come to you
[1463.74 --> 1465.74]  With open arms and open hands
[1466.74 --> 1468.74]  Seeking your mercy upon us
[1469.74 --> 1470.74]  So Lord this morning
[1470.74 --> 1472.74]  As we set aside this time to worship
[1472.74 --> 1473.74]  And to hear your word
[1474.74 --> 1475.74]  Lord would you come to us
[1476.74 --> 1477.74]  Speak to us by your spirit
[1477.74 --> 1479.74]  We pray in Jesus name
[1479.74 --> 1480.74]  Amen
[1482.74 --> 1483.74]  And so
[1483.74 --> 1484.74]  It's Christmas time
[1484.74 --> 1485.74]  And if we were to talk about
[1485.74 --> 1487.74]  Our favorite Christmas movies
[1488.74 --> 1489.74]  Well a Christmas story
[1490.74 --> 1492.74]  Might be a runaway winner
[1493.74 --> 1495.74]  And this is the movie
[1495.74 --> 1496.74]  Where every kid of course
[1497.74 --> 1498.74]  Learns to never lick
[1499.74 --> 1500.74]  A frozen flagpole
[1501.74 --> 1503.74]  It's a good lesson for all of us
[1504.74 --> 1506.74]  Now if I were to ask you
[1506.74 --> 1508.74]  Well what is your favorite Christmas
[1508.74 --> 1509.74]  Or Advent hymn
[1510.74 --> 1512.74]  Well there would be so many to choose from
[1513.74 --> 1514.74]  One of our favorite things to do
[1514.74 --> 1515.74]  In this Christmas season
[1516.74 --> 1517.74]  Is to sing
[1518.74 --> 1519.74]  So there's the plaintive longing
[1520.74 --> 1522.74]  Of O come O come Emmanuel
[1523.74 --> 1524.74]  One of my favorites
[1525.74 --> 1526.74]  There's the triumphant cheer
[1527.74 --> 1528.74]  Of joy to the world
[1529.74 --> 1530.74]  Or perhaps your favorite song
[1531.74 --> 1532.74]  Would be the hauntingly beautiful
[1533.74 --> 1534.74]  Silent night
[1534.74 --> 1536.74]  Well this morning
[1536.74 --> 1537.74]  The passage that we read
[1537.74 --> 1540.74]  Is actually the first Advent hymn
[1541.74 --> 1542.74]  It's known as the Magnificat
[1543.74 --> 1544.74]  Coming from its Latin title
[1545.74 --> 1547.74]  And not only is it the first Christmas carol
[1548.74 --> 1549.74]  It's perhaps one of the most famous songs
[1550.74 --> 1551.74]  Of the Christian church
[1552.74 --> 1553.74]  Right?
[1553.74 --> 1554.74]  It has been chanted in cathedrals
[1555.74 --> 1556.74]  All over the world
[1557.74 --> 1558.74]  It has also been sung
[1559.74 --> 1561.74]  In little country churches by candlelight
[1561.74 --> 1562.74]  The first time
[1562.74 --> 1563.74]  Johann Sebastian Bach
[1563.74 --> 1564.74]  Put it to
[1564.74 --> 1565.74]  Kettledrum
[1565.74 --> 1566.74]  And trumpet
[1567.74 --> 1568.74]  But
[1569.74 --> 1571.74]  Unlike some Christmas songs
[1572.74 --> 1573.74]  That we may love
[1573.74 --> 1574.74]  It's not a sappy
[1575.74 --> 1576.74]  Sentimental Christmas song
[1577.74 --> 1579.74]  Before being executed by the Nazis
[1580.74 --> 1581.74]  Dietrich Bonhoeffer spoke these words
[1582.74 --> 1583.74]  In a sermon during Advent
[1584.74 --> 1585.74]  In 1933
[1586.74 --> 1588.74]  The song of Mary
[1589.74 --> 1590.74]  Is the oldest Advent hymn
[1591.74 --> 1592.74]  It is at once
[1593.74 --> 1594.74]  The most passionate
[1595.74 --> 1596.74]  The wildest
[1597.74 --> 1598.74]  One might even say
[1598.74 --> 1599.74]  The most revolutionary Advent hymn ever sung
[1600.74 --> 1602.74]  This song has none of the sweet
[1603.74 --> 1604.74]  Nostalgic
[1604.74 --> 1605.74]  Or even playful tones
[1605.74 --> 1607.74]  Of some of our Christmas carols
[1608.74 --> 1609.74]  It is instead a hard
[1610.74 --> 1611.74]  Strong
[1611.74 --> 1612.74]  Inexorable song
[1612.74 --> 1613.74]  About the power of God
[1614.74 --> 1615.74]  And the powerlessness
[1616.74 --> 1617.74]  Of humankind
[1618.74 --> 1621.74]  And so before we dive in
[1622.74 --> 1624.74]  And look at this revolutionary song
[1625.74 --> 1627.74]  Let me set the stage for why
[1628.74 --> 1629.74]  She sings this song
[1630.74 --> 1632.74]  So in the passage we looked at last week
[1632.74 --> 1634.74]  The angel Gabriel comes to her and says
[1635.74 --> 1637.74]  You are going to bear the Messiah
[1638.74 --> 1639.74]  And when Mary hears that
[1639.74 --> 1640.74]  She is totally overwhelmed
[1641.74 --> 1642.74]  Because she knows
[1643.74 --> 1644.74]  The context of the Roman oppression
[1644.74 --> 1645.74]  That she is living in
[1646.74 --> 1648.74]  And there has been 400 years of silence
[1649.74 --> 1651.74]  Where God has not been there at all
[1652.74 --> 1653.74]  It would seem
[1654.74 --> 1655.74]  But she knows her scriptures
[1656.74 --> 1657.74]  Right?
[1657.74 --> 1658.74]  Mary knows the promises
[1659.74 --> 1661.74]  That a Messiah is going to come someday
[1662.74 --> 1663.74]  Right?
[1663.74 --> 1664.74]  She knows that a true Davidic king
[1664.74 --> 1665.74]  Will come
[1665.74 --> 1667.74]  Who is the true offspring of Abraham
[1668.74 --> 1669.74]  Who will one day come
[1669.74 --> 1671.74]  And bring blessings to the whole world
[1672.74 --> 1673.74]  She goes all the way back
[1674.74 --> 1675.74]  To Genesis 3.15
[1675.74 --> 1676.74]  Where it says
[1677.74 --> 1678.74]  The seed of the woman
[1678.74 --> 1679.74]  Would crush the head of the serpent
[1680.74 --> 1682.74]  And so Mary hears this announcement
[1683.74 --> 1684.74]  From the angel
[1684.74 --> 1685.74]  And she realizes
[1685.74 --> 1686.74]  This is going to happen
[1687.74 --> 1688.74]  God is sending finally
[1688.74 --> 1689.74]  The long awaited Messiah
[1689.74 --> 1691.74]  And it is going to happen
[1692.74 --> 1693.74]  Through me
[1694.74 --> 1695.74]  The birth of this Christ child
[1696.74 --> 1698.74]  And so that is why she is singing
[1699.74 --> 1701.74]  Eugene Peterson puts it this way
[1702.74 --> 1703.74]  He says
[1704.74 --> 1705.74]  When we are normal
[1706.74 --> 1707.74]  We talk
[1708.74 --> 1709.74]  When we are dying
[1710.74 --> 1711.74]  We whisper
[1712.74 --> 1713.74]  But when there is more in us
[1713.74 --> 1714.74]  Than we can contain
[1714.74 --> 1716.74]  And there was more in Mary
[1716.74 --> 1718.74]  Than she could contain
[1719.74 --> 1720.74]  So she bursts into song
[1721.74 --> 1722.74]  And why does she burst into song?
[1723.74 --> 1724.74]  Why does her heart
[1724.74 --> 1725.74]  Just erupt with praise to God?
[1726.74 --> 1727.74]  It is because
[1727.74 --> 1728.74]  God is showing mercy to his people
[1729.74 --> 1730.74]  Right?
[1730.74 --> 1732.74]  She talks about God's mercy twice
[1733.74 --> 1734.74]  In this song
[1735.74 --> 1736.74]  And as Christians
[1736.74 --> 1737.74]  We believe in and we worship
[1738.74 --> 1739.74]  A merciful God
[1740.74 --> 1741.74]  But what does that mean
[1741.74 --> 1743.74]  When we talk about God's mercy?
[1743.74 --> 1744.74]  Right?
[1744.74 --> 1746.74]  How are we to understand God's mercy?
[1747.74 --> 1748.74]  In his book
[1748.74 --> 1749.74]  On the attributes of God
[1750.74 --> 1751.74]  Mark Jones says this
[1752.74 --> 1754.74]  Mercy may be understood
[1755.74 --> 1756.74]  As God first taking
[1757.74 --> 1758.74]  Our misery to heart
[1759.74 --> 1760.74]  And then giving relief
[1761.74 --> 1762.74]  To the miserable
[1762.74 --> 1763.74]  Those two things
[1764.74 --> 1765.74]  And that is what this song is about
[1766.74 --> 1767.74]  That God in his mercy
[1768.74 --> 1769.74]  Has come to give relief
[1769.74 --> 1770.74]  To his people
[1771.74 --> 1772.74]  So today I want to reflect
[1772.74 --> 1773.74]  On those two aspects
[1773.74 --> 1774.74]  Of God's mercy
[1774.74 --> 1775.74]  That God in his mercy
[1776.74 --> 1777.74]  Sees us and takes
[1777.74 --> 1778.74]  Our misery to heart
[1779.74 --> 1780.74]  But then not only that
[1781.74 --> 1782.74]  He gives us relief
[1782.74 --> 1783.74]  He comes to us
[1784.74 --> 1785.74]  So that is what we will look at
[1788.74 --> 1789.74]  Friends in the back
[1789.74 --> 1790.74]  How are we doing here?
[1796.74 --> 1797.74]  No
[1797.74 --> 1798.74]  Are we live?
[1798.74 --> 1799.74]  Are we still live?
[1799.74 --> 1800.74]  Are we still live?
[1800.74 --> 1801.74]  Okay
[1802.74 --> 1803.74]  Oh okay
[1804.74 --> 1805.74]  Alright so maybe there were
[1805.74 --> 1806.74]  Technical difficulties
[1806.74 --> 1807.74]  If you are watching at home
[1808.74 --> 1809.74]  But I guess I am sure
[1809.74 --> 1810.74]  That we are still going
[1811.74 --> 1812.74]  Yeah okay
[1813.74 --> 1814.74]  So let's go
[1815.74 --> 1816.74]  So we are going to look at
[1816.74 --> 1817.74]  Those two aspects of God's mercy
[1817.74 --> 1818.74]  This morning
[1818.74 --> 1819.74]  And so the first one is this
[1820.74 --> 1821.74]  That God
[1822.74 --> 1823.74]  Takes our misery
[1824.74 --> 1825.74]  To heart
[1825.74 --> 1826.74]  He is not callous towards us
[1826.74 --> 1827.74]  He has compassion towards us
[1828.74 --> 1829.74]  And friends
[1829.74 --> 1830.74]  This acknowledges that
[1831.74 --> 1832.74]  In this life
[1833.74 --> 1834.74]  We face a great deal
[1835.74 --> 1836.74]  Of misery don't we?
[1836.74 --> 1837.74]  Right?
[1837.74 --> 1838.74]  And that is why Advent
[1838.74 --> 1839.74]  In the wisdom of our
[1840.74 --> 1841.74]  Church forebearers
[1842.74 --> 1843.74]  They talked about Advent
[1844.74 --> 1845.74]  As a season of darkness
[1846.74 --> 1847.74]  Right?
[1847.74 --> 1848.74]  It is the darkness
[1849.74 --> 1850.74]  Of waiting for the light
[1850.74 --> 1851.74]  That makes the brightness
[1851.74 --> 1852.74]  Then of Christmas
[1852.74 --> 1853.74]  Mourning
[1853.74 --> 1854.74]  That much more powerful
[1855.74 --> 1856.74]  And that is where
[1856.74 --> 1857.74]  Mary is
[1858.74 --> 1859.74]  As we read in this passage
[1859.74 --> 1860.74]  She was part of a
[1860.74 --> 1861.74]  Marginalized and oppressed people
[1862.74 --> 1865.74]  They were under the thumb
[1865.74 --> 1866.74]  Of this madman
[1867.74 --> 1868.74]  Named Herod
[1868.74 --> 1869.74]  Who was backed by the full force
[1869.74 --> 1870.74]  Of the Roman government
[1871.74 --> 1872.74]  And Herod thought nothing
[1873.74 --> 1874.74]  Of ordering a
[1875.74 --> 1876.74]  State sponsored genocide
[1876.74 --> 1877.74]  Just to protect his throne
[1878.74 --> 1879.74]  Just in case
[1879.74 --> 1880.74]  One of these infants
[1880.74 --> 1881.74]  That are born
[1881.74 --> 1882.74]  According to this prophecy
[1882.74 --> 1884.74]  Would come and take his place
[1885.74 --> 1886.74]  This is what we read about
[1886.74 --> 1887.74]  In Matthew's Gospel
[1888.74 --> 1889.74]  So this is the time
[1889.74 --> 1890.74]  In which God's people lived
[1891.74 --> 1892.74]  They lived there
[1893.74 --> 1894.74]  Holding on to some
[1895.74 --> 1896.74]  Ancient promises
[1897.74 --> 1898.74]  From hundreds of years ago
[1899.74 --> 1900.74]  That God would come
[1900.74 --> 1901.74]  And rescue them
[1902.74 --> 1903.74]  You know as we read
[1903.74 --> 1904.74]  Through the Bible
[1904.74 --> 1905.74]  And the story
[1905.74 --> 1906.74]  In the very last book
[1906.74 --> 1907.74]  Of the Old Testament
[1907.74 --> 1908.74]  The prophet Malachi
[1908.74 --> 1909.74]  He promises that
[1909.74 --> 1910.74]  When the Messiah comes
[1910.74 --> 1912.74]  He will arrive
[1912.74 --> 1913.74]  Like a son of righteousness
[1913.74 --> 1914.74]  With healing
[1914.74 --> 1915.74]  In his wings
[1916.74 --> 1917.74]  And it says that
[1917.74 --> 1918.74]  God's people
[1918.74 --> 1919.74]  Would frolic
[1919.74 --> 1921.74]  Like well fed calves
[1921.74 --> 1923.74]  On these green mountain hills
[1924.74 --> 1925.74]  Trampling down
[1925.74 --> 1926.74]  The oppressors
[1927.74 --> 1928.74]  In the Herods
[1928.74 --> 1929.74]  Of this world
[1931.74 --> 1932.74]  And then the book of Malachi
[1932.74 --> 1933.74]  Ends with that promise
[1933.74 --> 1934.74]  The curtain goes down
[1934.74 --> 1938.74]  And there's 400 years of silence
[1939.74 --> 1940.74]  400 years
[1941.74 --> 1942.74]  Of darkness
[1943.74 --> 1944.74]  Of waiting
[1945.74 --> 1946.74]  And that's the time
[1946.74 --> 1947.74]  That Mary is living in
[1948.74 --> 1949.74]  But it's also the time
[1949.74 --> 1950.74]  That we're living in
[1950.74 --> 1951.74]  Where we now
[1951.74 --> 1952.74]  As the church
[1953.74 --> 1954.74]  Even though Christ has come
[1954.74 --> 1955.74]  And his light has come
[1955.74 --> 1956.74]  But there's this
[1957.74 --> 1958.74]  This light intermingled
[1958.74 --> 1959.74]  With darkness
[1959.74 --> 1960.74]  And we're still living
[1960.74 --> 1961.74]  In this place
[1961.74 --> 1962.74]  Waiting again for Jesus
[1962.74 --> 1963.74]  To come again
[1964.74 --> 1965.74]  This is why
[1965.74 --> 1966.74]  Fleming Rutledge
[1966.74 --> 1967.74]  In her book on Advent
[1967.74 --> 1968.74]  Says this
[1968.74 --> 1969.74]  Advent always begins
[1969.74 --> 1970.74]  In the dark
[1971.74 --> 1973.74]  It's like Narnia
[1973.74 --> 1975.74]  Where it's always winter
[1976.74 --> 1977.74]  But never Christmas
[1978.74 --> 1979.74]  And that's why
[1979.74 --> 1980.74]  At the beginning of our worship service
[1980.74 --> 1981.74]  Today, you know
[1981.74 --> 1982.74]  When we had our Advent candles
[1983.74 --> 1985.74]  Here, at first they're not lit
[1986.74 --> 1989.74]  Because Advent begins in the dark
[1989.74 --> 1991.74]  And so each Sunday
[1991.74 --> 1992.74]  One candle is lit
[1992.74 --> 1993.74]  To remind us that
[1993.74 --> 1995.74]  Jesus, the light of the world
[1996.74 --> 1997.74]  Is coming
[1997.74 --> 1998.74]  And he is breaking
[1999.74 --> 2000.74]  Into the darkness
[2000.74 --> 2001.74]  Of our weary world
[2002.74 --> 2004.74]  So again, Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[2005.74 --> 2006.74]  He put it this way
[2006.74 --> 2007.74]  And I'll have
[2007.74 --> 2008.74]  See if we can put the slide up
[2010.74 --> 2011.74]  Let me advance here
[2011.74 --> 2020.74]  One more time
[2021.74 --> 2022.74]  Here it is
[2023.74 --> 2025.74]  So this is what he says
[2026.74 --> 2027.74]  A prison cell
[2028.74 --> 2029.74]  Because, you know, he's writing from prison
[2030.74 --> 2031.74]  He says a prison cell
[2031.74 --> 2032.74]  In which one waits, hopes
[2032.74 --> 2033.74]  And is completely dependent
[2034.74 --> 2036.74]  On the fact that the doors of freedom
[2037.74 --> 2038.74]  Has to be opened from the outside
[2038.74 --> 2040.74]  Is not a bad picture of Advent
[2043.74 --> 2044.74]  And that's why Mary here
[2045.74 --> 2046.74]  Sings with such a joy
[2047.74 --> 2048.74]  She says
[2049.74 --> 2051.74]  My soul glorifies the Lord
[2052.74 --> 2054.74]  My spirit rejoices
[2055.74 --> 2056.74]  Because she realizes
[2057.74 --> 2058.74]  That in the sun
[2059.74 --> 2060.74]  That is in her womb
[2061.74 --> 2062.74]  God has come
[2063.74 --> 2064.74]  Right?
[2064.74 --> 2065.74]  And he is about to unlock
[2065.74 --> 2066.74]  The prison door
[2066.74 --> 2067.74]  From the outside
[2067.74 --> 2069.74]  And he is about to make good
[2070.74 --> 2071.74]  On these promises
[2071.74 --> 2072.74]  That they have been waiting for
[2073.74 --> 2074.74]  That God would come in salvation
[2074.74 --> 2075.74]  And in justice
[2075.74 --> 2076.74]  To rescue his people
[2077.74 --> 2078.74]  That's what Mary says
[2079.74 --> 2081.74]  So listen to what she says here
[2082.74 --> 2083.74]  Why she sings
[2083.74 --> 2084.74]  And why she rejoices in God
[2085.74 --> 2086.74]  In verse 48 she says this
[2087.74 --> 2088.74]  For he has been mindful
[2089.74 --> 2091.74]  Of the humble state of his servant
[2092.74 --> 2093.74]  Mary basically says
[2093.74 --> 2095.74]  God sees me
[2096.74 --> 2097.74]  Right?
[2097.74 --> 2098.74]  God says
[2099.74 --> 2100.74]  He is mindful of me
[2101.74 --> 2102.74]  Mindful
[2103.74 --> 2104.74]  He has set his thoughts
[2105.74 --> 2106.74]  On me
[2106.74 --> 2107.74]  And then she
[2107.74 --> 2108.74]  When she mentions the humble state
[2108.74 --> 2109.74]  That she's in
[2110.74 --> 2111.74]  You know what she's saying
[2111.74 --> 2112.74]  Is that Mary
[2113.74 --> 2114.74]  She is not a significant person
[2114.74 --> 2115.74]  In the world's eyes
[2116.74 --> 2118.74]  In fact in the world's eyes
[2119.74 --> 2120.74]  She was an insignificant person
[2120.74 --> 2122.74]  From an insignificant little town
[2123.74 --> 2125.74]  In the midst of a Roman Empire
[2126.74 --> 2127.74]  That wouldn't care two hoots
[2128.74 --> 2129.74]  About this little place
[2130.74 --> 2131.74]  Called Nazareth
[2132.74 --> 2133.74]  And yet she's amazed
[2133.74 --> 2134.74]  That the Lord has seen her
[2135.74 --> 2136.74]  Of all people
[2137.74 --> 2138.74]  In the whole wide world
[2138.74 --> 2139.74]  God has seen her
[2140.74 --> 2141.74]  He has taken notice of her
[2142.74 --> 2143.74]  Not because of her performance
[2144.74 --> 2146.74]  Not because she is religiously up to par
[2146.74 --> 2148.74]  Not because of anything
[2148.74 --> 2149.74]  Not because of anything
[2149.74 --> 2150.74]  That she can boast in
[2151.74 --> 2152.74]  But in her humble state
[2153.74 --> 2154.74]  God has seen her
[2155.74 --> 2156.74]  And taken notice of her
[2157.74 --> 2158.74]  And so friends
[2158.74 --> 2160.74]  Do you know what will cause us to rejoice?
[2161.74 --> 2163.74]  How can we in the midst of a weary world
[2164.74 --> 2165.74]  Rejoice?
[2166.74 --> 2167.74]  To have this joy that
[2168.74 --> 2169.74]  Overcomes any situation
[2170.74 --> 2171.74]  And circumstance we're in
[2172.74 --> 2173.74]  You will rejoice like Mary
[2173.74 --> 2174.74]  When you know that
[2174.74 --> 2175.74]  Deep in your soul
[2175.74 --> 2176.74]  That what you long for most
[2177.74 --> 2178.74]  Has become a reality
[2179.74 --> 2180.74]  It has come
[2181.74 --> 2182.74]  That the Lord
[2182.74 --> 2183.74]  The creator of the universe
[2184.74 --> 2185.74]  The one who made you in his image
[2186.74 --> 2187.74]  Has taken notice of you
[2188.74 --> 2190.74]  And that there's nothing for you to earn
[2191.74 --> 2192.74]  There's nothing for you to have to achieve
[2193.74 --> 2194.74]  But that he looks upon you
[2195.74 --> 2197.74]  And desires a relationship with you
[2197.74 --> 2200.74]  You know, in 2020
[2201.74 --> 2202.74]  Is almost over
[2203.74 --> 2205.74]  We don't know what the next year will bring
[2206.74 --> 2209.74]  You know, but it has been a humble state for all of us
[2210.74 --> 2212.74]  You know, we are humbled by COVID
[2213.74 --> 2217.74]  And the loneliness and isolation that it brings to our lives
[2218.74 --> 2220.74]  We are humbled by sickness
[2221.74 --> 2223.74]  And the brevity of life
[2223.74 --> 2228.74]  We are humbled by the ways our marriages are stretched
[2229.74 --> 2232.74]  We're humbled by taking care of children
[2233.74 --> 2239.74]  But Advent says that God has come to look upon our humble state
[2240.74 --> 2242.74]  Right? Not to scold us in our sin and misery
[2243.74 --> 2247.74]  But to take it to heart in his love for us
[2248.74 --> 2251.74]  Okay, so that's the first part of God's mercy
[2251.74 --> 2255.74]  That God takes our misery to heart
[2256.74 --> 2258.74]  But thankfully God's mercy doesn't end there
[2259.74 --> 2260.74]  Or else it wouldn't do us any good, would it?
[2261.74 --> 2263.74]  Because not only does he take our misery to heart
[2264.74 --> 2265.74]  But he comes to help us
[2266.74 --> 2269.74]  Right? God gives relief to the miserable
[2270.74 --> 2271.74]  As we said in the beginning
[2272.74 --> 2273.74]  Right? And in this passage
[2274.74 --> 2275.74]  We see this in two ways
[2276.74 --> 2277.74]  How God gives a relief to the miserable
[2277.74 --> 2279.74]  Mary bursts into song
[2280.74 --> 2281.74]  For what Jesus has done for her
[2282.74 --> 2284.74]  And for what he is going to do in the world
[2285.74 --> 2287.74]  So the first thing that Mary is singing about
[2288.74 --> 2291.74]  Is God's mercy to her, to Mary
[2292.74 --> 2293.74]  And so think about it like this
[2294.74 --> 2295.74]  Why did Jesus come?
[2296.74 --> 2298.74]  He came because we in our sin
[2299.74 --> 2301.74]  Can absolutely not save ourselves
[2301.74 --> 2304.74]  It goes back to the quote by Bonhoeffer
[2305.74 --> 2306.74]  That we are in a prison cell
[2307.74 --> 2308.74]  The only way we can ever get free
[2309.74 --> 2310.74]  Is if someone from the outside comes
[2311.74 --> 2314.74]  And opens the door to our jail cell
[2315.74 --> 2318.74]  So again, remember why Mary is rejoicing
[2319.74 --> 2320.74]  She says, my soul rejoices in God
[2321.74 --> 2322.74]  My Savior
[2323.74 --> 2325.74]  Right? This very child
[2326.74 --> 2327.74]  That is her own son
[2327.74 --> 2328.74]  And her own son is at the same time
[2328.74 --> 2330.74]  The promised Messiah
[2330.74 --> 2332.74]  That she needs herself
[2333.74 --> 2334.74]  She says, this child
[2335.74 --> 2336.74]  Is going to save me
[2337.74 --> 2338.74]  This child is my savior
[2339.74 --> 2341.74]  So Mary bursts into song
[2342.74 --> 2343.74]  Because she is in awe of the fact
[2344.74 --> 2345.74]  That God
[2346.74 --> 2347.74]  Has seen her
[2348.74 --> 2350.74]  That God has called her
[2351.74 --> 2352.74]  His child
[2353.74 --> 2354.74]  And friends, this is the good news
[2354.74 --> 2355.74]  Of what God has done for us
[2355.74 --> 2358.74]  In this savior, Jesus Christ
[2359.74 --> 2361.74]  So I was reminded of this verse
[2362.74 --> 2364.74]  In 1 Peter 1, 3-4
[2365.74 --> 2366.74]  This is what it says
[2367.74 --> 2368.74]  Praise be to the God and Father
[2369.74 --> 2370.74]  Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2371.74 --> 2372.74]  In his great mercy
[2373.74 --> 2374.74]  He has given us a new birth
[2375.74 --> 2376.74]  Into a living hope
[2377.74 --> 2378.74]  Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2379.74 --> 2380.74]  From the dead
[2381.74 --> 2382.74]  And into an inheritance
[2382.74 --> 2383.74]  That can never perish, spoil, or fade
[2383.74 --> 2384.74]  This inheritance
[2384.74 --> 2385.74]  This inheritance is kept in heaven
[2386.74 --> 2387.74]  For you
[2391.74 --> 2392.74]  And friends, this
[2393.74 --> 2394.74]  Isn't just what awaits us
[2394.74 --> 2395.74]  On Christmas morning
[2396.74 --> 2398.74]  This is every morning of our lives
[2399.74 --> 2401.74]  That God has seen us
[2402.74 --> 2403.74]  In our misery and darkness
[2404.74 --> 2405.74]  But not only our circumstances
[2406.74 --> 2407.74]  He has seen us in the darkness
[2407.74 --> 2408.74]  Of our own hearts
[2408.74 --> 2409.74]  He has seen it
[2409.74 --> 2410.74]  He has seen it all the way
[2410.74 --> 2411.74]  To the bottom
[2412.74 --> 2413.74]  But
[2413.74 --> 2414.74]  Not because of who we are
[2415.74 --> 2416.74]  But because of his mercy
[2416.74 --> 2417.74]  He has chosen us
[2418.74 --> 2419.74]  He has forgiven us
[2419.74 --> 2420.74]  Of our sins
[2421.74 --> 2422.74]  He has lifted us up
[2422.74 --> 2423.74]  And called us blessed
[2424.74 --> 2426.74]  So Mary here
[2427.74 --> 2428.74]  Is celebrating the mercy of God
[2428.74 --> 2429.74]  In her own life
[2429.74 --> 2431.74]  But the second thing
[2431.74 --> 2432.74]  That she is singing about
[2432.74 --> 2433.74]  Isn't just for her
[2434.74 --> 2436.74]  But what Jesus is doing
[2437.74 --> 2438.74]  For the entire world
[2439.74 --> 2440.74]  And you know
[2440.74 --> 2441.74]  When we think about the world
[2442.74 --> 2443.74]  Again, you know
[2444.74 --> 2445.74]  It's tough to read the news
[2446.74 --> 2449.74]  And what seems to be the constant norm
[2450.74 --> 2452.74]  Is that we are living in a broken
[2453.74 --> 2454.74]  And unjust world
[2454.74 --> 2456.74]  And to this
[2457.74 --> 2458.74]  This is what Mary says
[2459.74 --> 2461.74]  So let me read from verses 51 to 53 now
[2464.74 --> 2465.74]  It says
[2466.74 --> 2467.74]  Why are we back at the beginning?
[2468.74 --> 2469.74]  Oh no we're not, okay
[2470.74 --> 2471.74]  This is verse 51
[2472.74 --> 2473.74]  It says
[2474.74 --> 2476.74]  He has scattered those who are proud
[2477.74 --> 2478.74]  In their inmost thoughts
[2479.74 --> 2480.74]  He has brought down rulers from their thrones
[2481.74 --> 2482.74]  But has lifted up the humble
[2482.74 --> 2484.74]  He has filled the hungry with good things
[2485.74 --> 2487.74]  But has sent the rich away empty
[2489.74 --> 2490.74]  And so
[2490.74 --> 2491.74]  There's a reversal going on here
[2492.74 --> 2493.74]  Isn't there?
[2493.74 --> 2494.74]  It says
[2494.74 --> 2495.74]  The proud
[2496.74 --> 2497.74]  Will be brought down low
[2498.74 --> 2499.74]  The humble
[2499.74 --> 2500.74]  Will be lifted up
[2501.74 --> 2502.74]  The rich will be sent away empty
[2503.74 --> 2504.74]  Well the poor
[2505.74 --> 2506.74]  And the hungry will be gathered in
[2507.74 --> 2508.74]  And they will be filled
[2509.74 --> 2511.74]  See this is a promise of divine justice
[2512.74 --> 2513.74]  For the world
[2514.74 --> 2515.74]  See God is going to take
[2515.74 --> 2516.74]  The Marys
[2517.74 --> 2518.74]  And the Elizabeths of this world
[2519.74 --> 2520.74]  To bring down the mighty
[2521.74 --> 2523.74]  Like notice God isn't sending his son
[2524.74 --> 2526.74]  To be born through Herod's household is he?
[2527.74 --> 2528.74]  Right?
[2528.74 --> 2531.74]  Herod's life and his reign is about to come to an end
[2532.74 --> 2534.74]  He's about to be written out of the story
[2535.74 --> 2538.74]  Because God is using Mary to bring about a revolution
[2538.74 --> 2541.74]  And so in the 20th century
[2542.74 --> 2545.74]  When India was trying to get out from under British rule
[2546.74 --> 2550.74]  The church was sympathetic to Indian nationalism
[2551.74 --> 2553.74]  So the British were sending spies into the churches
[2554.74 --> 2558.74]  To see who is sympathetic to this revolution
[2558.74 --> 2561.74]  So the Archbishop of Canterbury
[2561.74 --> 2563.74]  Who was William Temple at the time
[2564.74 --> 2565.74]  He warned the churches in India
[2566.74 --> 2567.74]  Whatever you do
[2568.74 --> 2569.74]  Do not read this text
[2570.74 --> 2571.74]  Right? Don't read the Magnificat
[2572.74 --> 2573.74]  Because he said
[2574.74 --> 2575.74]  It is a most revolutionary hymn
[2576.74 --> 2579.74]  Right? Because it's a reminder to the Herods of this world
[2580.74 --> 2581.74]  That their days are numbered
[2581.74 --> 2584.74]  So what Mary is telling us
[2584.74 --> 2589.74]  Is that God's mercy is something that's far, far bigger than ourselves
[2590.74 --> 2593.74]  Right? It's about what God is doing in the midst of his world
[2594.74 --> 2595.74]  In the midst of his people
[2596.74 --> 2597.74]  To renew all things
[2598.74 --> 2600.74]  To bring justice to a world that has been
[2601.74 --> 2602.74]  Where justice has been perverted
[2603.74 --> 2604.74]  Because God is a God of justice
[2605.74 --> 2606.74]  It all stems from who he is
[2606.74 --> 2609.74]  And because of who he is as believers
[2610.74 --> 2613.74]  We follow God in bringing his kingdom to earth
[2614.74 --> 2616.74]  To bring justice to the oppressed
[2617.74 --> 2618.74]  To feed the hungry
[2618.74 --> 2619.74]  Because this is who God is
[2619.74 --> 2620.74]  And this is what he is doing
[2621.74 --> 2623.74]  And it is where the future is headed
[2624.74 --> 2630.74]  You know, I began talking about favorite Christmas hymns
[2631.74 --> 2634.74]  Well, another favorite that some of you might have
[2634.74 --> 2635.74]  Would be
[2635.74 --> 2636.74]  O Little Town of Bethlehem
[2637.74 --> 2639.74]  Now for me, I always thought
[2639.74 --> 2642.74]  This was such a kind of sentimental Christmas song
[2643.74 --> 2645.74]  Maybe it kind of brings up this image of
[2646.74 --> 2647.74]  Nativity scene
[2647.74 --> 2649.74]  Of children nestled all snug in their beds
[2650.74 --> 2651.74]  Things like that
[2652.74 --> 2653.74]  But actually
[2654.74 --> 2655.74]  That is the wrong image to have
[2656.74 --> 2658.74]  Because the song actually contains this bold claim
[2659.74 --> 2660.74]  It says
[2660.74 --> 2663.74]  Because the hopes and fears of all the years
[2663.74 --> 2665.74]  Are met in thee tonight
[2666.74 --> 2667.74]  Right?
[2667.74 --> 2669.74]  The hopes and the fears of all the years
[2669.74 --> 2670.74]  Are met in thee tonight
[2671.74 --> 2673.74]  You know, Jesus fulfills the hopes of all the years
[2674.74 --> 2677.74]  Because he is the long-awaited Messiah
[2678.74 --> 2679.74]  Right?
[2679.74 --> 2681.74]  So for Mary, for anyone who is humble
[2682.74 --> 2684.74]  For anyone who needs God's mercy
[2684.74 --> 2685.74]  Jesus comes
[2685.74 --> 2686.74]  And it is just like
[2686.74 --> 2688.74]  Ah, the hopes of all the years
[2689.74 --> 2691.74]  Are met in this King Jesus
[2692.74 --> 2693.74]  Right?
[2693.74 --> 2694.74]  Jesus meets our deepest longings
[2695.74 --> 2697.74]  Including our longing for mercy
[2698.74 --> 2701.74]  He has taken our misery to heart
[2702.74 --> 2704.74]  And in his covenant faithfulness
[2705.74 --> 2708.74]  He comes as the light into our darkness
[2708.74 --> 2709.74]  To relieve us
[2709.74 --> 2710.74]  To relieve us
[2711.74 --> 2714.74]  But for someone who opposes that
[2715.74 --> 2717.74]  For someone who is proud
[2718.74 --> 2719.74]  And self-sufficient
[2720.74 --> 2721.74]  Who would be their own King
[2722.74 --> 2723.74]  Jesus is coming
[2723.74 --> 2724.74]  Is a terrifying event
[2727.74 --> 2728.74]  So I want to wrap up
[2729.74 --> 2732.74]  By thinking together about some application
[2733.74 --> 2734.74]  And the question is
[2734.74 --> 2736.74]  What are some ways
[2736.74 --> 2737.74]  Practically that we
[2738.74 --> 2739.74]  Can be brought to singing
[2740.74 --> 2741.74]  Like Mary?
[2742.74 --> 2743.74]  Just like her
[2743.74 --> 2744.74]  We live in the midst of a world
[2745.74 --> 2747.74]  That is dark in a lot of ways
[2748.74 --> 2749.74]  But like her
[2750.74 --> 2751.74]  Even despite
[2752.74 --> 2753.74]  Where we are living
[2754.74 --> 2755.74]  We can rejoice
[2756.74 --> 2757.74]  We can rejoice in God our Savior
[2758.74 --> 2759.74]  Because of who Jesus is
[2760.74 --> 2761.74]  And that he has come in his mercy
[2761.74 --> 2762.74]  How can we do that?
[2762.74 --> 2763.74]  Here are just two practical
[2764.74 --> 2765.74]  Two practical things
[2766.74 --> 2767.74]  Two words that begin with S
[2768.74 --> 2769.74]  Saints and Scripture
[2770.74 --> 2771.74]  Okay, saints and Scripture
[2772.74 --> 2773.74]  So first, saints
[2774.74 --> 2775.74]  We didn't read it
[2776.74 --> 2777.74]  But in the section before
[2778.74 --> 2779.74]  Mary sings this song of the Magnificat
[2780.74 --> 2782.74]  She visits her auntie Elizabeth
[2783.74 --> 2784.74]  Who is the mother of John the Baptist
[2785.74 --> 2787.74]  And so as she is wrestling with this news
[2788.74 --> 2789.74]  That the angel has told her
[2789.74 --> 2792.74]  That she is going to give birth to the Christ child
[2793.74 --> 2794.74]  You know, she is thinking
[2794.74 --> 2795.74]  How can this be?
[2795.74 --> 2796.74]  You know, did I just imagine an angel
[2796.74 --> 2797.74]  That came and visit me?
[2798.74 --> 2799.74]  Right? I don't know
[2800.74 --> 2801.74]  And it is in the context
[2802.74 --> 2803.74]  Of friendship
[2804.74 --> 2805.74]  And of this gospel relationship
[2806.74 --> 2807.74]  That the penny drops
[2808.74 --> 2809.74]  And she is like
[2810.74 --> 2811.74]  As John the Baptist
[2811.74 --> 2812.74]  Kind of leaps in the womb
[2812.74 --> 2813.74]  At the sound of Mary
[2813.74 --> 2815.74]  And Elizabeth sings her own song
[2816.74 --> 2817.74]  And saying
[2818.74 --> 2819.74]  He is greeting this, the Messiah
[2820.74 --> 2821.74]  Mary is like, oh my goodness
[2822.74 --> 2823.74]  This is really happening
[2824.74 --> 2825.74]  And so then she sings
[2826.74 --> 2827.74]  And so it is in this company of Elizabeth
[2828.74 --> 2829.74]  That Mary finds the strength
[2830.74 --> 2832.74]  To believe in God's promises
[2833.74 --> 2834.74]  And to sing her Advent song
[2835.74 --> 2837.74]  And so friends, what that means is
[2837.74 --> 2838.74]  What that means is
[2838.74 --> 2839.74]  We need community to rejoice
[2840.74 --> 2841.74]  And that has been one of the things
[2842.74 --> 2843.74]  That we most need and long for
[2844.74 --> 2845.74]  In this time of COVID
[2846.74 --> 2847.74]  We need one another
[2848.74 --> 2849.74]  We need one another's voices
[2850.74 --> 2851.74]  We need one another's love
[2852.74 --> 2854.74]  We need one another's reminders
[2854.74 --> 2856.74]  Of the blessings that we have in Jesus
[2857.74 --> 2858.74]  So I want to encourage us
[2859.74 --> 2860.74]  As a church family
[2861.74 --> 2863.74]  To seek one another out in community
[2863.74 --> 2866.74]  And I want to encourage us to do it now
[2867.74 --> 2869.74]  Even though it is hard in this time
[2870.74 --> 2872.74]  Because it is even more important now than ever
[2873.74 --> 2874.74]  You know, in one of the ways
[2875.74 --> 2876.74]  We are going to try to do this today
[2876.74 --> 2877.74]  We are going to try something new
[2878.74 --> 2879.74]  Which is right after our worship service
[2880.74 --> 2881.74]  We are going to have a fellowship time
[2882.74 --> 2883.74]  We are not going to be in the fellowship hall
[2884.74 --> 2885.74]  But you can go on Zoom
[2886.74 --> 2887.74]  And the link was sent out to you
[2888.74 --> 2889.74]  Maybe bring your own coffee, your own snack
[2890.74 --> 2891.74]  And we will just kind of visit face to face
[2891.74 --> 2892.74]  Encourage one another
[2893.74 --> 2894.74]  Chat and greet one another
[2895.74 --> 2896.74]  So I invite you to do that
[2897.74 --> 2898.74]  Right after our service today
[2899.74 --> 2900.74]  So that is saints
[2900.74 --> 2901.74]  We need saints
[2902.74 --> 2903.74]  The second thing we need is scripture
[2904.74 --> 2905.74]  Right, if you look at this song
[2906.74 --> 2908.74]  This song is steeped in scripture
[2909.74 --> 2910.74]  Right, Mary is an incredible theologian
[2911.74 --> 2913.74]  So let me highlight some of the references
[2914.74 --> 2915.74]  That she alludes to in this psalm
[2916.74 --> 2917.74]  She alludes to Psalm 22
[2918.74 --> 2919.74]  Psalm 44
[2919.74 --> 2920.74]  Psalm 89
[2920.74 --> 2921.74]  Psalm 98
[2922.74 --> 2923.74]  Psalm 103
[2923.74 --> 2924.74]  Psalm 147
[2925.74 --> 2926.74]  She is also referring to Hannah
[2927.74 --> 2928.74]  In 2 Samuel
[2929.74 --> 2930.74]  And she is referring to the prophet Isaiah
[2931.74 --> 2933.74]  Right, her song is filled with scripture
[2934.74 --> 2936.74]  So what does that mean for us?
[2937.74 --> 2940.74]  It means that rejoicing comes from reading the word
[2941.74 --> 2943.74]  Reading it
[2944.74 --> 2945.74]  Reflecting on it
[2945.74 --> 2946.74]  Reflecting on it
[2946.74 --> 2947.74]  Remembering it
[2948.74 --> 2949.74]  Rehearsing it
[2949.74 --> 2950.74]  Reliving it in our lives
[2951.74 --> 2953.74]  So as a very practical thing
[2954.74 --> 2955.74]  You know, now in the season of Advent
[2956.74 --> 2957.74]  We are doing this Advent devotional
[2958.74 --> 2959.74]  Together as a church
[2960.74 --> 2962.74]  And I want to invite you to use this devotional
[2963.74 --> 2964.74]  To read the word
[2965.74 --> 2966.74]  And as you read it
[2967.74 --> 2968.74]  It will help you to rejoice
[2969.74 --> 2970.74]  Because you will read this book
[2970.74 --> 2971.74]  This Bible
[2971.74 --> 2972.74]  That is full of God's promises
[2973.74 --> 2974.74]  And how they are being fulfilled
[2975.74 --> 2976.74]  And have been fulfilled
[2977.74 --> 2978.74]  In Jesus Christ
[2978.74 --> 2979.74]  The one we celebrate
[2980.74 --> 2981.74]  In Advent and in Christmas
[2982.74 --> 2983.74]  And so let me pray for us
[2984.74 --> 2986.74]  And we will prepare ourselves
[2987.74 --> 2989.74]  To commune with the Lord at the table
[2990.74 --> 2991.74]  So let's pray together
[2991.74 --> 2992.74]  Our Heavenly Father
[2993.74 --> 2994.74]  Our Heavenly Father
[2994.74 --> 2995.74]  You have visited us
[2996.74 --> 2997.74]  In our
[2998.74 --> 2999.74]  Our weariness
[3000.74 --> 3001.74]  In our darkness
[3002.74 --> 3003.74]  And you have done so
[3003.74 --> 3004.74]  Because of your mercy
[3005.74 --> 3007.74]  Lord, you are the merciful God
[3008.74 --> 3009.74]  And we worship you
[3010.74 --> 3011.74]  Lord, you are the merciful God
[3011.74 --> 3012.74]  And so we look to you
[3013.74 --> 3014.74]  And we rest in you
[3015.74 --> 3017.74]  Because you are making all things new
[3017.74 --> 3018.74]  Lord, make things new
[3018.74 --> 3019.74]  Lord, make things new
[3019.74 --> 3020.74]  In our lives
[3020.74 --> 3021.74]  In our hearts
[3021.74 --> 3022.74]  In our families
[3022.74 --> 3023.74]  In our church
[3023.74 --> 3024.74]  In the city
[3024.74 --> 3025.74]  In this world
[3025.74 --> 3026.74]  Lord, we need your mercy
[3027.74 --> 3028.74]  We pray in Jesus' name
[3028.74 --> 3029.74]  Amen
[3042.74 --> 3043.74]  So friends, as we
[3044.74 --> 3046.74]  Come to the Lord's table this morning
[3046.74 --> 3048.74]  We are reminded once again
[3049.74 --> 3051.74]  That we are dependent on God's mercy
[3052.74 --> 3053.74]  For Jesus said to us
[3054.74 --> 3055.74]  Truly, truly I say to you
[3056.74 --> 3058.74]  Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[3059.74 --> 3060.74]  And drink his blood
[3061.74 --> 3063.74]  You have no life in you
[3064.74 --> 3066.74]  We need Jesus' sacrifice on the cross
[3067.74 --> 3068.74]  His broken body
[3069.74 --> 3070.74]  His shed blood
[3071.74 --> 3072.74]  In order to receive God's mercy
[3073.74 --> 3074.74]  And so in this simple meal
[3074.74 --> 3076.74]  We are reminded of that truth
[3077.74 --> 3078.74]  And so here by word
[3079.74 --> 3080.74]  By faith
[3081.74 --> 3084.74]  We enter into this intimate communion with God
[3085.74 --> 3086.74]  For which we were made
[3087.74 --> 3089.74]  And for which Christ has come to save us
[3091.74 --> 3092.74]  So friends, if you are watching
[3093.74 --> 3094.74]  And this is not your faith
[3095.74 --> 3097.74]  That you are not trusting in Jesus as your Savior
[3097.74 --> 3099.74]  Then we are grateful
[3100.74 --> 3102.74]  That you are worshiping with us
[3103.74 --> 3106.74]  But we ask that you would not partake in this part
[3107.74 --> 3108.74]  Of communion
[3109.74 --> 3111.74]  But use this time to consider God's love for you
[3112.74 --> 3113.74]  His mercy toward you
[3114.74 --> 3116.74]  Because he gave himself for the life of the world
[3116.74 --> 3122.74]  So now here are these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper
[3123.74 --> 3124.74]  The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed
[3125.74 --> 3126.74]  He took bread
[3127.74 --> 3128.74]  And when he had given thanks
[3129.74 --> 3130.74]  He broke it and said
[3131.74 --> 3132.74]  This is my body which is for you
[3133.74 --> 3135.74]  Do this in remembrance of me
[3136.74 --> 3139.74]  The same way also he took the cup after supper
[3139.74 --> 3141.74]  Saying this cup is a new covenant in my blood
[3142.74 --> 3144.74]  For as often as you drink it
[3145.74 --> 3146.74]  Do this in remembrance of me
[3147.74 --> 3149.74]  For as often as you eat this bread
[3150.74 --> 3151.74]  And drink this cup
[3152.74 --> 3153.74]  You proclaim the Lord's death
[3154.74 --> 3155.74]  Until he comes again
[3156.74 --> 3157.74]  So brothers and sisters
[3158.74 --> 3161.74]  These are the gifts of God for the people of God
[3162.74 --> 3165.74]  So feed on him in your hearts by faith
[3166.74 --> 3167.74]  With thanksgiving
[3167.74 --> 3170.74]  Knowing that Jesus Christ your merciful Savior
[3171.74 --> 3172.74]  Has died for you
[3173.74 --> 3176.74]  And so we are of course doing this virtually
[3177.74 --> 3180.74]  And so maybe at home you have already prepared your
[3181.74 --> 3184.74]  Your bread, your grape juice or wine
[3185.74 --> 3187.74]  And so we will now take it together
[3188.74 --> 3189.74]  So please if you take your bread
[3190.74 --> 3195.74]  Friends take, eat, remember, and do this
[3195.74 --> 3197.74]  Friends take, eat, remember, and believe
[3198.74 --> 3199.74]  That the body of Christ
[3200.74 --> 3201.74]  Was broken for you
[3202.74 --> 3220.74]  Now we will also take the cup
[3220.74 --> 3221.74]  So take, drink, and believe
[3221.74 --> 3224.74]  So take, drink, remember, and believe
[3225.74 --> 3228.74]  That the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3229.74 --> 3230.74]  Was shed for you for the remission of sins
[3231.74 --> 3232.74]  So let us drink together
[3233.74 --> 3240.74]  And would you pray with me?
[3240.74 --> 3243.74]  Jesus, we celebrate your mercy
[3243.74 --> 3247.74]  This mercy that was revealed to us
[3248.74 --> 3249.74]  As you hung on the cross
[3250.74 --> 3251.74]  Paying for our sins
[3252.74 --> 3253.74]  Lord, in your broken body
[3253.74 --> 3256.74]  Your shed blood that was broken and bled in our place
[3257.74 --> 3258.74]  To wash away our sins
[3259.74 --> 3260.74]  And to give us your righteousness
[3261.74 --> 3262.74]  Lord, we thank you
[3262.74 --> 3265.74]  And Lord, by your grace and by your mercy
[3266.74 --> 3267.74]  Would you help us
[3268.74 --> 3270.74]  Even in a dark and weary world
[3271.74 --> 3272.74]  Lord, to follow you
[3273.74 --> 3274.74]  And trust you and look to you
[3275.74 --> 3276.74]  We pray for your help by your Holy Spirit
[3277.74 --> 3278.74]  In Jesus name, amen
[3279.74 --> 3283.74]  So let's together sing our song of response
[3283.74 --> 3285.74]  A song of response
[3313.74 --> 3318.74]  Longing for life
[3319.74 --> 3320.74]  In waiting darkness
[3321.74 --> 3324.74]  Longing for truth
[3325.74 --> 3326.74]  Be turned to you
[3327.74 --> 3332.74]  Make us all the high people
[3333.74 --> 3336.74]  Light for the world to see
[3338.74 --> 3340.74]  Longing for peace
[3340.74 --> 3341.74]  Peace
[3341.74 --> 3343.74]  Our world is trouble
[3344.74 --> 3346.74]  Longing for hope
[3347.74 --> 3348.74]  And in despair
[3349.74 --> 3351.74]  Your word alone
[3352.74 --> 3354.74]  Will come to save us
[3355.74 --> 3359.74]  Make us your living voice
[3360.74 --> 3363.74]  Rise, be your light
[3364.74 --> 3367.74]  Shine in our hearts
[3367.74 --> 3368.74]  Losing for love
[3368.74 --> 3370.74]  And in despair
[3370.74 --> 3371.74]  To the darkness
[3371.74 --> 3373.74]  Rise, be your light
[3373.74 --> 3376.74]  Shine in your church
[3377.74 --> 3378.74]  Dether today
[3379.74 --> 3380.74]  Longing for food
[3381.74 --> 3382.74]  Many are hungry
[3382.74 --> 3383.74]  Longing for water
[3383.74 --> 3385.74]  Many still thirst
[3386.74 --> 3388.74]  Make us long
[3388.74 --> 3389.74]  For love
[3389.74 --> 3391.74] aning
[3391.74 --> 3392.74]  Longing for water
[3392.74 --> 3394.74]  Any still thirst
[3394.74 --> 3396.74]  Make us young
[3396.74 --> 3397.74]  Work
[3397.74 --> 3398.74]  Broken
[3398.74 --> 3399.74]  For others
[3400.74 --> 3402.74]  Share in tell
[3403.74 --> 3415.74]  all up
[3415.74 --> 3417.74]  Bye now
[3417.74 --> 3427.74]  Make us your building, sheltering others, close me the biggest door.
[3429.10 --> 3438.50]  Rise, be our light, shine in our hearts, turn through the darkness.
[3438.50 --> 3448.62]  Rise, be our light, shine in your church, gather today.
[3451.96 --> 3462.50]  Many the gifts, many the people, many the hearts dare to belong.
[3462.50 --> 3472.80]  Let us be servants to one another, making your kingdom high.
[3473.30 --> 3482.66]  Rise, be our light, shine in our hearts, turn through the darkness.
[3482.66 --> 3492.22]  Rise, be our light, shine in your church, gather today.
[3492.22 --> 3513.22]  We come before God with the prayers of the people.
[3513.22 --> 3520.38]  And before we do that, we would like to send our condolences to Jerry and Joan.
[3521.12 --> 3524.76]  Jerry's sister Dina passed away on Friday.
[3525.82 --> 3532.74]  And also we learned on Wednesday that a former pastor of this congregation, Pastor Henry, passed away on Wednesday.
[3533.86 --> 3537.06]  And so our condolences to his family as well.
[3537.94 --> 3538.92]  Please join me in prayer.
[3538.92 --> 3548.16]  Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father, Mighty God, Prince of Peace,
[3548.74 --> 3550.24]  Your name is holy.
[3551.20 --> 3552.88]  Your love is infinite.
[3553.76 --> 3556.16]  Your faithfulness is new every morning.
[3557.32 --> 3558.84]  And this is why we come to you.
[3559.32 --> 3561.28]  You are our rock and refuge.
[3561.66 --> 3565.84]  The one who came to us in the flesh to become one of us.
[3565.84 --> 3572.88]  Everlasting Father, we are in the wilderness, waiting for this pandemic to be over.
[3573.54 --> 3577.12]  And for some semblance of normalcy to return to our lives.
[3577.98 --> 3581.92]  We give you thanks for scientists who have developed vaccines.
[3582.80 --> 3588.12]  We pray for safety of these vaccines and good process in distribution in order to save lives.
[3588.12 --> 3594.42]  We thank you for healthcare workers who risk their own health and lives to care for the sick.
[3595.48 --> 3601.32]  We ask your comfort for those who have lost loved ones during this past year because of COVID and other illnesses.
[3602.44 --> 3605.86]  As humans, we cannot escape disease and death.
[3606.58 --> 3609.54]  We cannot escape sin and its consequences.
[3610.50 --> 3616.50]  We can only lean into your grace and goodness in these times, for we know you walk with us.
[3616.50 --> 3623.92]  We give you praise and thanksgiving for continued healing for Julie after surgery to remove brain tumors.
[3624.88 --> 3626.84]  You have heard our prayers on her behalf.
[3627.72 --> 3630.42]  Great physician, give her full recovery, we pray.
[3632.38 --> 3638.82]  Mighty God, we ask your daily, even moment-by-moment care for those we know who are sick with cancer.
[3640.04 --> 3645.12]  Kathy in hospice, Tim, Kim, and Joan at home.
[3645.12 --> 3652.02]  May they experience your presence deeply through your Holy Spirit and through those who care for them.
[3653.68 --> 3658.68]  Be with Tony and Marion as Tony deals with the severe pain of shingles.
[3659.76 --> 3662.56]  Please heal him quickly from this terrible discomfort.
[3664.52 --> 3668.50]  Bring wholeness to all suffering pain, illness, and sorrow.
[3670.02 --> 3674.62]  Lord, comfort Jerry and Joan in the loss of Jerry's older sister this past week.
[3675.12 --> 3677.60]  Thank you that she was spared pain.
[3678.54 --> 3682.66]  Be near her family as they grieve her loss and remember her life.
[3682.66 --> 3690.02]  We pray for Pastor Henry's family who lost their husband, father, and grandfather this week.
[3690.72 --> 3698.32]  We are thankful for the good work that Pastor Henry did among us for many years and for his life of service in your kingdom.
[3699.62 --> 3703.36]  Spirit of all comfort, walk with steam in the days to come.
[3703.36 --> 3707.00]  May their family experience your peace.
[3708.78 --> 3715.14]  We give thanks for our local hospice and ask that you'll bless the compassionate care provided there,
[3715.42 --> 3720.74]  despite the upheaval regarding the government's mandate to provide medical assistance in dying.
[3720.74 --> 3727.92]  May your will be done and may those entering hospice continue to be well cared for.
[3729.38 --> 3735.66]  Lord, we remember all those of our own fellowship, neighbors, and friends who live alone and can't have visitors.
[3737.12 --> 3741.90]  Trinitarian God, you've made us in your image, needing community.
[3741.90 --> 3748.90]  Help us to find ways to be in community even when we cannot visit in person.
[3751.28 --> 3756.36]  Wonderful Counselor, we lay before you the opioid crisis and countless in Vancouver
[3756.36 --> 3760.36]  and our own neighborhoods who are living under the power of addiction,
[3760.76 --> 3764.02]  which often leads to mental health issues and sometimes homelessness.
[3765.14 --> 3769.96]  Bless the work of agencies and individuals involved in the hard work of breaking these shackles.
[3769.96 --> 3776.56]  Guide and comfort parents who have children in addiction and children who have parents in addiction.
[3777.52 --> 3778.70]  Have mercy, dear Lord.
[3780.12 --> 3782.90]  In all these trials, we pray for your church.
[3784.00 --> 3789.14]  May we never lose faith, but stand firm in the knowledge of your deliverance and your coming kingdom.
[3790.46 --> 3791.86]  Hold us fast, we pray.
[3792.92 --> 3799.20]  In all these things, may we see glimpses of your glory and be bearers of your light as you give us opportunity.
[3799.96 --> 3806.24]  Thank you that you never abandon us and that you make all things beautiful in your time.
[3807.08 --> 3808.62]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[3809.82 --> 3810.14]  Amen.
[3810.96 --> 3811.44]  Amen.

[3828.26 --> 3835.20]  So I invite you to hold out your hands, receive the merciful blessing of your Father.
[3835.20 --> 3843.60]  Brothers and sisters, humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
[3844.56 --> 3848.46]  Cast all of your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

[3855.62 --> 3861.12]  will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.
[3861.64 --> 3864.26]  To him be the power forever and ever.
