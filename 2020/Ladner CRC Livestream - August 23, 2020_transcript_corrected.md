[278.00 → 280.00] Good morning.
[280.00 → 282.00] It's August 23.
[282.00 → 284.00] You're at the Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[284.00 → 290.00] It's a sunny day, although sadly we're getting close to the end of the summer.
[290.00 → 295.00] If you're a regular attender here, we're sad you're not here.
[295.00 → 297.00] We wish you were here.
[297.00 → 300.00] If you're not a regular attendant, I'm looking in on YouTube.
[300.00 → 302.00] Well, we're glad you're here.
[302.00 → 305.00] With us, myself, I'm John Smit.
[305.00 → 308.00] I'll be doing aspects of the worship leading this morning.
[308.00 → 316.00] The rest of our worship team is Bart, Tony, Jackie, with Mel on the organ this morning.
[316.00 → 322.00] For sound and video, folks you'll never see back there are Andrew and Doug.
[322.00 → 331.00] Later, Pastor Bert Rostra, who's well known to us with considerable fondness from his time back when we were without a pastor.
[331.00 → 335.00] He came here often and regaled us, and we welcome him back with fondness.
[335.00 → 339.00] He's living in Abbotsford, came in all that way this morning.
[339.00 → 342.00] We'll open God's word and bring the message this morning.
[342.00 → 346.00] The title of his message is, The Wrong Time for Gifts.
[346.00 → 352.00] I grew up thinking there was never a wrong time for gifts, but I think he's going to explain that to us.
[352.00 → 359.00] Next week, Pastor Jason True will return from vacationing at the Shushed Lakes to lead us.
[359.00 → 365.00] We wish his family and him a relaxing time while he's away today.
[365.00 → 370.00] Today's offering is a reminder that things remain not normal.
[370.00 → 378.00] For you to give an offering, you'll have to mail a check, drop off a check, make an online contribution.
[378.00 → 382.00] Check out the Connections' newsletter for any of those details.
[382.00 → 389.00] Speaking of the newsletter, it is emailed to you or mailed to you, nearly all of you.
[389.00 → 393.00] Otherwise, drop by the church and Dorothy will get you a copy.
[393.00 → 395.00] Currently number 9, August 15.
[395.00 → 398.00] Today's offering is for A. Rocha.
[398.00 → 404.00] It equips community gardeners across Canada to grow food for their less fortunate neighbours
[404.00 → 407.00] and provide environmental education programs.
[407.00 → 410.00] Our offering next week will be Servants Anonymous.
[410.00 → 416.00] This foundation provides long-term housing, recovery, and training for women and their children
[416.00 → 420.00] escaping human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
[420.00 → 425.00] Once again, we thank you for the faithfulness you've shown in the offerings that you've been giving
[425.00 → 429.00] even though it can be difficult to make those offerings.
[430.00 → 435.00] To begin our service this morning, I'd like to offer an opening prayer.
[435.00 → 440.00] Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the universe.
[440.00 → 444.00] In your wisdom, you have made all creation to worship you.
[444.00 → 448.00] You call us to worship you now in this time and place.
[448.00 → 456.00] As we prepare for worship, we pray that you will quiet our hearts, that we may hear your voice in your word.
[456.00 → 462.00] Lord, we pray that you will stir our hearts, that we may more faithfully follow Jesus,
[462.00 → 466.00] and that you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer to you.
[466.00 → 469.00] Bless those who lead us in worship.
[469.00 → 471.00] May we worship today.
[471.00 → 477.00] Help us to offer our entire lives to you and unite with your whole church throughout the world.
[477.00 → 484.00] We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Spirit is one God. Amen.
[484.00 → 489.00] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 92, verses 1 and 2.
[489.00 → 494.00] It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High,
[494.00 → 498.00] proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness.
[498.00 → 504.00] The Lord's greeting comes to us from Isaiah 42, verses 6.
[504.00 → 510.00] I am the Lord. I have called you in righteousness. I have taken you by the hand and kept you.
[510.00 → 517.00] I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind.
[517.00 → 525.00] I am the Lord. That is my name. My glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.
[525.00 → 526.00] I am the Lord.
[526.00 → 531.00] With that as a beginning, we'll sing several songs of praise, beginning with As the Deer.
[531.00 → 533.00] As the Deer
[533.00 → 534.00] As the Deer
[534.00 → 538.00] As the Deer
[538.00 → 543.00] As the Deer
[543.00 → 560.00] As the Deer
[560.00 → 562.00] Before the
[590.00 → 591.20] spirit
[591.20 → 594.14] you
[594.14 → 596.74] you alone
[596.74 → 599.08] are my heart's
[599.08 → 600.84] desire and I
[600.84 → 602.30] long to
[602.30 → 604.56] worship you
[604.56 → 608.56] you're
[608.56 → 610.78] my friend and you
[610.78 → 612.88] are my brother
[612.88 → 614.58] even though
[614.58 → 616.44] you are
[616.44 → 619.00] a king
[619.00 → 621.58] I love you
[621.58 → 624.16] more than any
[624.16 → 626.58] other so much more
[626.58 → 628.58] than anything
[629.10 → 632.58] you
[632.58 → 633.58] alone
[633.58 → 635.44] are my strength
[635.44 → 636.58] my shield
[636.58 → 638.58] to you
[638.58 → 639.58] alone
[639.58 → 641.80] may my spirit
[641.80 → 642.58] yield
[642.58 → 645.58] you
[645.58 → 646.58] alone
[646.58 → 649.16] are my heart's
[649.74 → 651.52] desire and I
[651.52 → 653.00] long to
[653.00 → 654.16] worship
[654.16 → 655.16] you
[655.16 → 659.16] I
[659.16 → 660.16] want you
[660.16 → 662.16] more than gold
[662.16 → 663.16] or silver
[663.16 → 665.16] you can
[665.16 → 667.16] satisfy
[667.16 → 669.74] you
[669.74 → 670.74] you
[670.74 → 671.74] you
[671.74 → 672.74] alone
[672.74 → 674.74] are the real
[674.74 → 676.86] joy giver and the
[676.86 → 678.74] apple of
[678.74 → 680.74] my eye
[680.74 → 682.74] you
[682.74 → 684.74] alone
[684.74 → 686.74] are my strength
[686.74 → 688.32] my shield
[688.32 → 688.36] my shield
[688.36 → 689.32] to you
[689.32 → 689.74] you
[689.74 → 691.32] alone
[691.32 → 693.26] may my spirit
[693.26 → 694.32] yield
[694.32 → 697.32] you
[697.32 → 698.32] alone
[698.32 → 700.32] are my heart's
[701.42 → 703.20] desire and I
[703.20 → 704.32] long to
[704.32 → 706.32] worship
[706.32 → 707.32] you
[707.32 → 711.34] some
[711.34 → 712.52] of
[712.52 → 713.90] you
[713.90 → 714.90] oh
[714.90 → 717.78] some
[717.78 → 718.22] 48
[718.22 → 719.32] the song
[719.32 → 720.80] the song
[720.80 → 721.36] of the
[721.36 → 722.26] sons of
[722.26 → 722.70] Torah
[722.70 → 725.12] great is the
[725.12 → 725.40] Lord
[725.40 → 725.96] and most
[725.96 → 726.66] worthy of
[726.66 → 727.16] praise
[727.16 → 727.96] in the city
[727.96 → 728.38] of our
[728.38 → 728.74] God
[728.74 → 729.48] his holy
[729.48 → 729.92] mountain
[729.92 → 731.60] within
[731.60 → 732.46] your temple
[732.46 → 733.12] oh God
[733.12 → 733.78] we meditate
[733.78 → 734.70] on your
[734.70 → 741.00] unfailing love. Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the
[741.00 → 747.98] earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness. Mount Zion rejoices. The
[747.98 → 754.62] villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments. Walk about Zion. Go
[754.62 → 760.80] around her. Count her towers. Consider well her ramparts. View her citadels that
[760.80 → 767.64] you may tell of them to the next generation. For this God is our God forever
[767.64 → 773.36] and ever. He will be our guide even to the end.
[773.36 → 803.36] From the depths of the sea
[803.36 → 815.98] From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people,
[815.98 → 833.84] With some we raise, Lord, throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praise, Lord, who's high.
[833.84 → 845.40] Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, who's high.
[845.40 → 852.10] Be magnified, be magnified.
[855.48 → 866.40] From the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens,
[866.40 → 872.48] From the heights of the heavens, your name be praised.
[872.48 → 883.76] From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the depths of all people,
[883.76 → 891.84] from the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea,
[891.84 → 903.28] Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praise, Lord, who's high.
[903.28 → 914.28] Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, who's high.
[914.28 → 920.98] Be magnified, be magnified.
[920.98 → 921.98] Be magnified.
[921.98 → 931.68] What can wash away my sin?
[931.68 → 935.54] Nothing but the blood of Jesus is our next praise song.
[936.54 → 941.76] Washing of our hands during the pandemic, a much requested practice right now.
[941.76 → 944.54] Washing to make yourself clean.
[944.54 → 948.98] Prepare yourself to have dinner properly, with clean hands.
[949.70 → 951.82] Washing to make yourself clean.
[952.58 → 956.00] Cleanse yourself from impurities, also spiritually.
[956.96 → 961.40] Washing has been a part of Christian practices for many centuries.
[962.06 → 965.66] Example, washing hands in preparation for prayer.
[965.66 → 974.42] However, the best washing for us, sinners that we are, is the washing away of our sins.
[975.16 → 978.62] Our sins have been washed away by the blood of Jesus.
[979.36 → 981.80] Thanks to our God for such a gift.
[982.52 → 986.56] The Apostle John says in Revelation 1, verse 5,
[987.40 → 992.34] To him who has loved us and washed us from our sins in his blood,
[992.34 → 996.82] and has made us kings and priests to his God and Father,
[997.60 → 1001.44] to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[1002.12 → 1006.52] And together with the Apostles, we can also say amen to that.
[1007.08 → 1007.78] Let us sing.
[1007.78 → 1007.80] Let us sing.
[1007.80 → 1025.18] What can wash our people's sake?
[1025.18 → 1029.08] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1029.86 → 1033.46] What can make me whole again?
[1034.18 → 1037.48] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1037.80 → 1046.62] O precious is the flow that makes me white as snow.
[1047.02 → 1050.84] No other fount I know.
[1051.24 → 1054.72] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1057.12 → 1061.18] For my pardon this I see.
[1061.72 → 1065.00] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1065.00 → 1069.62] For my cleansing is my plea.
[1069.62 → 1073.52] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1073.52 → 1082.74] O precious is the flow that makes me white as snow.
[1082.74 → 1084.74] No other fount I know.
[1084.74 → 1087.04] No other fount I know.
[1087.04 → 1091.02] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1093.44 → 1097.54] Nothing can pour sin atone.
[1097.90 → 1101.46] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1101.46 → 1105.34] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1105.34 → 1107.08] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1107.08 → 1110.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1110.20 → 1111.20] No other fount I see.
[1111.20 → 1112.20] No other fount I see.
[1112.20 → 1113.20] No other fount I know.
[1113.20 → 1115.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1115.20 → 1117.20] No other fount I know.
[1117.20 → 1124.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1124.20 → 1128.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1128.20 → 1130.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1130.20 → 1135.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1135.20 → 1139.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1139.20 → 1140.20] Just else.
[1140.20 → 1141.20] Not and source.
[1141.20 → 1142.20] You are unfair.
[1142.20 → 1143.20] The blood of Jesus.
[1143.20 → 1144.20] No one fount I see.
[1144.38 → 1146.20] Nothing where the blood of Jesus.
[1146.20 → 1147.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

[1148.22 → 1151.20] This is all my righteousness.
[1151.20 → 1152.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1152.20 → 1153.20] Oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow.
[1153.20 → 1154.20] spy Ti Abraham
[1154.24 → 1155.52] No other fount I know.
[1155.58 → 1158.36] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1158.36 → 1161.00] Oh onboard I know.
[1161.48 → 1168.00] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1168.00 → 1197.98] Thank you.
[1198.00 → 1202.22] A paraphrase written by Mary Fairchild.
[1228.00 → 1257.98] A paraphrase written by Mary Fairchild.
[1257.98 → 1262.98] A paraphrase written by Mary Fairchild.
[1262.98 → 1265.98] A paraphrase written by Mary Fairchild.
[1265.98 → 1272.98] Give honour to your father and mother by treating them with respect and obedience.
[1272.98 → 1277.98] Do not deliberately kill a fellow human being.
[1277.98 → 1282.98] Don't hate people or hurt them with words and actions.
[1282.98 → 1288.98] Do not have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse.
[1288.98 → 1292.98] God forbid sex outside the bonds of marriage.
[1292.98 → 1296.98] Respect your body and other people's bodies.
[1296.98 → 1304.98] Do not steal or take anything that doesn't belong to you unless you've been given permission to do so.
[1304.98 → 1311.98] Do not tell a lie about someone or bring a false accusation against another person.
[1311.98 → 1314.98] Always tell the truth.
[1314.98 → 1317.98] And number 10.
[1317.98 → 1321.98] Do not desire anything or anyone that does not belong to you.
[1321.98 → 1329.98] Comparing yourself to others and longing to have what they have can lead to jealousy, envy, and other sins.
[1329.98 → 1335.98] Be content by focusing on the blessings of God that God has given you and not what he has not given you.
[1335.98 → 1341.98] Be thankful for what God has given you.
[1341.98 → 1349.98] In thinking of the summary of the law, we have to admit that at times we have not loved the Lord our God with all our hearts,
[1349.98 → 1353.98] with all our souls, and with all our minds.
[1353.98 → 1358.98] And secondly, we have not always loved our neighbour as ourselves.
[1358.98 → 1363.98] In short, we have not perfectly obeyed God's law.
[1363.98 → 1365.98] But it doesn't end there.
[1365.98 → 1373.98] For us believers, in the words of Reverend Heather Mooney, inspired by Psalm 15,
[1373.98 → 1378.98] the psalmist declares that those who speak the truth from their heart will abide in God's sanctuary.
[1378.98 → 1383.98] God hears the difficult truths we have named aloud and in the silence of our hearts.
[1383.98 → 1388.98] Now let the wonderful gift of God's forgiveness flow through you.
[1388.98 → 1394.98] May the abundance of God's mercy and grace set you free to serve God with love.
[1394.98 → 1397.98] And Paul's words from Philippians 4, verse 19.
[1397.98 → 1404.98] This same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches,
[1404.98 → 1408.98] which has been given to us in Christ Jesus.
[1408.98 → 1412.98] Shall we sing a song of response before the throne of God above?
[1412.98 → 1415.98] Before the throne of God above.
[1415.98 → 1441.46] Before the throne of God above,
[1441.46 → 1446.02] I have a strong and perfect plea,
[1446.42 → 1450.68] A great heart-priest whose name is love,
[1451.02 → 1455.22] Whoever lives and pleads for me.
[1455.62 → 1460.06] My name is written on his hands,
[1460.40 → 1464.78] My name is written on his heart,
[1465.12 → 1469.36] I know that while in heaven he stands,
[1469.36 → 1473.36] No tongue can be with hands depart,
[1474.16 → 1479.48] No tongue can be with hands depart.
[1480.86 → 1485.44] When Satan tempts me to despair,
[1485.90 → 1489.36] God tells me of the guilt within,
[1490.54 → 1494.36] Upwards I look and see him there,
[1494.36 → 1499.48] Obeyed an end of all my sin.
[1500.00 → 1504.48] Because the sinless Saviour died,
[1504.86 → 1508.36] My sinful soul is mounted free,
[1509.62 → 1513.72] To all the justice satisfied,
[1514.20 → 1517.82] To look on him and pardon me.
[1517.82 → 1523.46] To look upon him and pardon me.
[1525.46 → 1529.82] Behold him there, the risen Lamb,
[1530.72 → 1534.16] My perfect spotless righteousness,
[1535.52 → 1539.70] Be great, unchangeable I am,
[1540.06 → 1543.82] The King of glory and of grace.
[1543.82 → 1549.60] One with himself I cannot die,
[1549.60 → 1554.44] My soul is purchased by his love,
[1554.68 → 1558.60] My life is he with Christ on high,
[1559.44 → 1563.60] With Christ my Saviour and my God,
[1564.16 → 1569.46] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1569.46 → 1570.16] Amen.
[1570.16 → 1570.36] Amen.
[1570.36 → 1570.52] Amen.
[1570.52 → 1570.92] Amen.
[1570.92 → 1571.38] Amen.
[1571.38 → 1571.50] Amen.
[1571.50 → 1571.98] Amen.
[1581.98 → 1582.34] Amen.
[1582.34 → 1582.66] Amen.
[1582.66 → 1583.00] Good morning.
[1583.20 → 1584.96] Our scripture reading for this morning
[1584.96 → 1586.48] is from the Old Testament,
[1586.82 → 1589.28] the second book of Kings.
[1589.48 → 1591.62] And I was going to read just the verses 15
[1591.62 → 1593.10] to the end of the chapter,
[1593.24 → 1595.68] but then decided I should probably put it
[1595.68 → 1596.78] in a larger context.
[1596.88 → 1598.62] So we're going to read all of 2 Kings,
[1598.62 → 1599.62] chapter 5,
[1599.72 → 1600.94] but you won't actually see the words
[1600.94 → 1603.62] on the screen until verse 15.
[1603.84 → 1604.50] My bad.
[1606.26 → 1607.30] This is the story.
[1608.28 → 1610.52] And yes, there is a wrong time for gifts.
[1612.62 → 1615.16] Now Norman was commander of the army
[1615.16 → 1616.58] of the king of Arm.
[1617.64 → 1620.14] He was a great man in the sight of his master
[1620.14 → 1621.32] and highly regarded,
[1622.00 → 1623.86] because through him the Lord had given
[1623.86 → 1625.18] victory to Arm.
[1625.18 → 1627.64] He was a valiant soldier,
[1627.96 → 1629.90] but he had leprosy.
[1631.18 → 1633.14] Now Ransom Arm had gone out
[1633.14 → 1635.36] and had taken captive a young girl from Israel
[1635.36 → 1637.28] and she served Norman's wife.
[1638.34 → 1639.44] She said to her mistress,
[1639.44 → 1642.38] if only my master would see the prophet
[1642.38 → 1643.44] who is in Samaria,
[1643.72 → 1645.70] he would cure him of his leprosy.
[1647.22 → 1648.46] Norman went to his master
[1648.46 → 1650.60] and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
[1651.30 → 1652.08] By all means,
[1652.16 → 1653.34] the king of Arm replied,
[1653.64 → 1655.56] I will send a letter to the king of Israel.
[1656.44 → 1657.60] So Norman left,
[1657.82 → 1659.72] taking with him 10 talents of silver,
[1660.32 → 1662.42] 6,000 shekels of gold,
[1662.82 → 1664.80] and 10 sets of clothing.
[1665.54 → 1666.62] The letter that he took
[1666.62 → 1668.06] to the king of Israel read,
[1669.16 → 1670.02] With this letter,
[1670.14 → 1672.46] I am sending my servant Norman to you
[1672.46 → 1675.52] so that you may cure him of his leprosy.
[1676.62 → 1678.28] As soon as the king of Israel
[1678.28 → 1679.10] read the letter,
[1679.64 → 1681.36] he tore his robes and said,
[1681.80 → 1682.70] Am I God?
[1683.34 → 1685.40] Can I kill and bring back to life?
[1686.00 → 1688.32] Why does this fellow send someone to me
[1688.32 → 1689.92] to be cured of his leprosy?
[1690.56 → 1692.90] See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.
[1692.90 → 1696.06] When Elisha, the man of God,
[1696.16 → 1697.30] heard that the king of Israel
[1697.30 → 1698.44] had torn his robes,
[1698.90 → 1700.10] he sent him this message.
[1700.88 → 1703.92] Why have you torn your robes?
[1704.68 → 1705.98] Have the man come to me,
[1706.34 → 1707.30] and he will know
[1707.30 → 1709.36] that there is a prophet in Israel.
[1710.72 → 1713.16] So Norman went with his horses and chariots
[1713.16 → 1715.08] and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.
[1715.84 → 1717.90] Elisha sent a messenger to say to him,
[1718.36 → 1721.74] Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan,
[1721.74 → 1723.86] and your flesh will be restored,
[1724.32 → 1726.00] and you will be cleansed.
[1726.98 → 1729.28] But Norman went away angry and said,
[1729.52 → 1731.72] I thought that he would surely come out to me
[1731.72 → 1734.62] and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God,
[1734.98 → 1736.42] wave his hand over the spot,
[1736.62 → 1738.10] and cure me of my leprosy.
[1739.10 → 1740.70] Are not Ababa and Far par,
[1740.80 → 1741.86] the rivers of Damascus,
[1742.00 → 1743.86] better than any of the waters of Israel?
[1744.42 → 1746.32] Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?
[1746.32 → 1749.32] And so he turned and went off in a rage.
[1750.74 → 1752.86] Norman's servants went to him and said,
[1753.18 → 1753.66] My father,
[1754.32 → 1757.32] if the prophet had told you to do some great thing,
[1758.16 → 1759.22] would you not have done it?
[1759.86 → 1761.88] How much more than when he tells you,
[1762.58 → 1764.40] wash and be cleansed?
[1765.62 → 1767.88] So he went down and did himself in the Jordan
[1767.88 → 1770.00] seven times as the man of God had told him,
[1770.24 → 1771.58] and his flesh was restored
[1771.58 → 1773.94] and became clean like that of a young boy.
[1773.94 → 1776.96] Then Norman and all his attendants
[1776.96 → 1778.30] went back to the man of God.
[1778.76 → 1780.06] He stood before him and said,
[1780.42 → 1783.46] Now I know that there is no God in all the world
[1783.46 → 1785.42] except in Israel.
[1786.02 → 1789.42] Please accept now a gift from your servant.
[1790.50 → 1791.76] The prophet answered,
[1791.90 → 1794.00] As surely as the Lord lives whom I serve,
[1794.26 → 1795.94] I will not accept a thing.
[1797.14 → 1799.08] And even though Norman urged him,
[1799.74 → 1800.46] he refused.
[1801.38 → 1803.12] If you will not, said Norman,
[1803.12 → 1804.72] please let me, your servant,
[1805.14 → 1806.28] be given as much earth
[1806.28 → 1807.84] as a pair of mules can carry.
[1808.36 → 1810.18] For your servant will never again
[1810.18 → 1811.98] make burnt offerings and sacrifices
[1811.98 → 1814.38] to any other God but the Lord.
[1815.18 → 1817.18] But may the Lord forgive your servant
[1817.18 → 1818.20] for this one thing.
[1818.98 → 1821.30] When my master enters the temple of Simon
[1821.30 → 1822.60] to bow down,
[1822.90 → 1824.52] and he is leaning on my arm,
[1824.74 → 1826.10] and I bow there also,
[1826.56 → 1828.74] when I bow down in the temple of Simon,
[1828.74 → 1831.92] may the Lord forgive your servant for this.
[1833.12 → 1834.98] Go in peace, Elisha said.
[1837.20 → 1840.00] After Norman had travelled some distance,
[1840.26 → 1842.60] Ghazi, the servant of Elisha,
[1842.74 → 1843.48] the man of God,
[1843.86 → 1844.80] said to himself,
[1845.58 → 1847.90] My master was too easy on Norman,
[1848.48 → 1849.62] this Ara mean,
[1850.32 → 1852.30] by not accepting from him what he brought.
[1852.66 → 1854.22] As surely as the Lord lives,
[1854.46 → 1855.64] I will run after him
[1855.64 → 1857.24] and get something from him.
[1857.24 → 1860.22] So Ghazi hurried after Norman.
[1860.62 → 1862.34] When Norman saw him running toward him,
[1862.36 → 1863.98] he got down from the chariot to meet him.
[1864.12 → 1865.04] Is everything all right?
[1865.06 → 1865.56] He asked.
[1866.14 → 1867.22] Everything is all right,
[1867.30 → 1868.12] Ghazi answered.
[1868.52 → 1870.10] My master sent me to say,
[1870.62 → 1872.54] Two young men from the company of the prophets
[1872.54 → 1873.66] have just come to me
[1873.66 → 1875.40] from the hill country of Ephraim.
[1875.78 → 1876.24] Please,
[1876.56 → 1877.98] give them a talent of silver
[1877.98 → 1879.48] and two sets of clothing.
[1880.20 → 1881.10] By all means,
[1881.40 → 1882.20] take two talents,
[1882.36 → 1882.86] said Norman.
[1882.86 → 1885.70] He urged Ghazi to accept them
[1885.70 → 1888.24] and then tied up the two talents of silver
[1888.24 → 1889.08] in two bags
[1889.08 → 1890.78] with two sets of clothing.
[1891.46 → 1893.22] He gave them to two of his servants
[1893.22 → 1895.14] and they carried them ahead of Ghazi.
[1896.42 → 1898.22] When Ghazi came to the hill,
[1898.34 → 1899.64] he took the things from the servants
[1899.64 → 1901.08] and put them away in the house.
[1901.50 → 1903.40] He sent the men away and they left.
[1904.20 → 1904.96] Then he went in
[1904.96 → 1906.44] and stood before his master,
[1906.86 → 1907.26] Elisha.
[1909.58 → 1910.64] Where have you been,
[1911.34 → 1911.76] Ghazi?
[1911.76 → 1911.92] Ghazi?
[1912.62 → 1913.50] Elisha asked.
[1914.24 → 1916.36] Your servant didn't go anywhere,
[1916.82 → 1917.82] Ghazi answered.
[1919.00 → 1920.60] But Elisha said to him,
[1921.32 → 1922.84] Was not my spirit with you
[1922.84 → 1925.36] when the man got down from his chariot to meet you?
[1926.22 → 1928.76] Is this the time to take money
[1928.76 → 1930.68] or to accept clothes,
[1931.32 → 1933.14] olive groves, vineyards, flocks,
[1933.30 → 1935.30] herds, or men's servants and maidservants?
[1936.06 → 1938.02] Norman's leprosy will cling to you
[1938.02 → 1939.58] and to your descendants forever.
[1939.58 → 1943.10] Then Ghazi went from Elisha's presence
[1943.10 → 1944.76] and he was leprous
[1944.76 → 1947.12] as white as snow.
[1947.54 → 1949.66] This is the word of the Lord.
[1949.66 → 1953.32] Let's pray together.
[1953.54 → 1954.80] Gracious God, we thank you
[1954.80 → 1956.70] for your word
[1956.70 → 1958.80] and as we reflect now on this story,
[1958.94 → 1959.58] we pray that
[1959.58 → 1962.06] we may understand what it is
[1962.06 → 1963.54] you are trying to say to us
[1963.54 → 1965.04] also today,
[1965.18 → 1966.98] so many centuries later.
[1967.66 → 1969.22] Would you bring that word
[1969.22 → 1971.00] to life for us today?
[1971.30 → 1972.42] In Jesus' name,
[1972.42 → 1973.30] Amen.
[1977.04 → 1978.66] It is a true story
[1978.66 → 1980.52] and some of you may know it.
[1981.54 → 1982.44] In 2005,
[1982.92 → 1983.70] Roy Pearson,
[1984.44 → 1985.76] a newly appointed judge
[1985.76 → 1987.94] in Washington, D.C.,
[1987.94 → 1990.92] turned a $10 dry cleaning bill
[1990.92 → 1992.70] for a pair of trousers
[1992.70 → 1998.18] into a $67 million civil lawsuit.
[1998.18 → 2001.64] The judge said in court papers
[2001.64 → 2003.16] that he had been put
[2003.16 → 2003.84] through the wringer
[2003.84 → 2006.56] because the Korean immigrants
[2006.56 → 2008.78] who ran his neighbourhood dry cleaner
[2008.78 → 2012.54] lost the prized pair of pants
[2012.54 → 2014.04] he wanted to wear
[2014.04 → 2015.56] on the first day,
[2015.66 → 2016.64] his first day,
[2016.96 → 2017.60] on the bench.
[2018.78 → 2020.36] Although the pants were found
[2020.36 → 2021.28] three weeks later,
[2021.60 → 2023.50] he declared that he had endured,
[2023.66 → 2024.22] and I quote,
[2024.22 → 2025.82] mental suffering,
[2026.30 → 2027.24] inconvenience,
[2027.44 → 2028.32] and discomfort,
[2029.00 → 2030.88] all because he was unable
[2030.88 → 2032.62] to wear his favourite suit
[2032.62 → 2034.42] on the first day of work.
[2036.46 → 2037.96] The couple who owned the store
[2037.96 → 2039.12] was so intimidated
[2039.12 → 2040.62] by the judge's lawsuit,
[2041.26 → 2042.78] they offered him $12,000,
[2043.98 → 2045.32] though the pants were valued
[2045.32 → 2047.24] at $395.
[2048.78 → 2050.90] But there was no consoling
[2050.90 → 2051.68] Mr. Pearson
[2051.68 → 2053.52] who turned them down,
[2053.52 → 2055.32] although he did reduce
[2055.32 → 2056.10] his demands
[2056.10 → 2057.32] to a more modest
[2057.32 → 2059.10] $54 million.
[2060.60 → 2062.42] He sued for 10 years
[2062.42 → 2063.98] of weekend car rentals,
[2064.08 → 2065.20] though he didn't own a car,
[2065.94 → 2067.24] because now, of course,
[2067.34 → 2068.34] he would have to take
[2068.34 → 2069.06] his dry cleaning
[2069.06 → 2070.44] to someplace far away
[2070.44 → 2071.40] from his neighbourhood.
[2072.58 → 2073.46] And he sued
[2073.46 → 2074.78] because the dry cleaner's
[2074.78 → 2075.92] storefront sign,
[2076.26 → 2076.76] it read,
[2077.14 → 2078.54] satisfaction guaranteed,
[2079.34 → 2079.94] had not,
[2080.08 → 2080.80] in his opinion,
[2081.44 → 2081.98] been honoured.
[2081.98 → 2085.32] In June 2007,
[2086.00 → 2086.92] he brought the case
[2086.92 → 2087.56] to trial
[2087.56 → 2088.96] where he tearfully
[2088.96 → 2091.14] testified in open court
[2091.14 → 2093.10] about the mental anguish
[2093.10 → 2094.10] he had suffered.
[2096.02 → 2097.28] The good news is
[2097.28 → 2099.62] that not only did Pearson
[2099.62 → 2100.68] lose the case,
[2101.32 → 2102.40] he was also forced
[2102.40 → 2103.50] to pay his defendants
[2103.50 → 2104.40] legal fees.
[2104.40 → 2106.88] when, one year later,
[2107.34 → 2108.46] a judicial panel
[2108.46 → 2109.48] recommended
[2109.48 → 2111.36] to not give Pearson
[2111.36 → 2112.46] a 10-year term
[2112.46 → 2113.12] on the bench,
[2113.52 → 2114.78] citing a lack
[2114.78 → 2116.60] of judicial temperament,
[2117.26 → 2118.66] the judge brought
[2118.66 → 2119.32] a lawsuit
[2119.32 → 2120.22] against the panel,
[2121.40 → 2122.02] proclaiming that
[2122.02 → 2122.82] the real reason
[2122.82 → 2123.72] for not giving him
[2123.72 → 2124.80] a new term of office
[2124.80 → 2125.74] was his suit
[2125.74 → 2126.96] against the dry cleaners.
[2128.36 → 2129.30] The story,
[2129.76 → 2130.10] however,
[2130.74 → 2131.72] has a happy ending.
[2131.72 → 2133.56] A short time later,
[2133.66 → 2134.64] a federal judge
[2134.64 → 2136.20] threw that lawsuit
[2136.20 → 2137.04] out of court,
[2137.04 → 2138.54] and so,
[2138.70 → 2139.18] in the end,
[2139.94 → 2140.62] Judge Pearson,
[2141.40 → 2142.58] kissing his six-figure
[2142.58 → 2143.52] salary goodbye,
[2144.34 → 2145.54] not only lost his pants,
[2145.64 → 2146.18] but also,
[2146.42 → 2146.96] so to speak,
[2147.62 → 2148.18] his shirt.
[2148.18 → 2152.56] Of course,
[2152.80 → 2154.38] the amount of money
[2154.38 → 2155.68] involved in this case
[2155.68 → 2157.18] was unusual.
[2158.60 → 2160.08] But Judge Pearson's
[2160.08 → 2161.22] response to losing
[2161.22 → 2162.06] his pants
[2162.06 → 2163.50] is not,
[2164.24 → 2164.68] is it?
[2165.56 → 2167.06] We live in a litigious
[2167.06 → 2168.42] society where people
[2168.42 → 2169.04] sue each other
[2169.04 → 2170.24] at the drop of a hat,
[2170.62 → 2172.14] especially if the dropped hat
[2172.14 → 2173.10] makes somebody
[2173.10 → 2174.40] fall and sprain
[2174.40 → 2175.04] an ankle.
[2176.24 → 2177.18] So what's an ankle
[2177.18 → 2177.54] worth?
[2178.84 → 2180.10] A couple of thousands?
[2180.46 → 2181.34] Probably more
[2181.34 → 2182.26] if you play Tuesday night
[2182.26 → 2183.56] basketball or Friday night
[2183.56 → 2183.88] hockey.
[2185.00 → 2186.24] What's a finger worth?
[2187.44 → 2189.04] What's a child's life
[2189.04 → 2189.64] worth?
[2191.40 → 2192.62] In our culture,
[2192.76 → 2193.50] people sue
[2193.50 → 2195.10] because it seems
[2195.10 → 2196.02] that everything,
[2196.88 → 2197.72] a pair of pants,
[2198.60 → 2199.06] a finger,
[2199.80 → 2200.92] even life itself,
[2201.80 → 2203.12] everything has
[2203.12 → 2204.30] a price.
[2205.64 → 2206.24] Everything.
[2206.24 → 2206.34] nothing.
[2207.98 → 2208.30] But,
[2208.52 → 2211.26] but even
[2211.26 → 2212.16] the healing
[2212.16 → 2212.76] mercy
[2212.76 → 2214.26] and the grace
[2214.26 → 2215.50] of God?
[2216.94 → 2217.50] Well,
[2217.56 → 2218.00] all of us
[2218.00 → 2218.50] would immediately
[2218.50 → 2218.90] say,
[2219.02 → 2219.26] no,
[2219.40 → 2220.06] of course not.
[2221.94 → 2223.22] Except that is not
[2223.22 → 2224.06] what Ghazi,
[2224.34 → 2225.08] the servant of
[2225.08 → 2225.72] Elisha,
[2225.78 → 2226.08] said.
[2227.90 → 2228.42] No,
[2228.62 → 2229.08] he said,
[2229.16 → 2230.10] even God's
[2230.10 → 2230.72] healing grace
[2230.72 → 2231.62] has a price.
[2232.62 → 2233.86] And that lies
[2233.86 → 2234.44] at the heart
[2234.44 → 2235.20] of today's
[2235.20 → 2236.18] Bible story.
[2237.46 → 2238.82] At the same time,
[2238.88 → 2239.60] it is a story
[2239.60 → 2240.58] that teaches us
[2240.58 → 2242.08] that our conduct
[2242.08 → 2242.80] as Christians
[2242.80 → 2244.62] can never be seen
[2244.62 → 2245.42] in isolation.
[2245.42 → 2247.66] but all we do
[2247.66 → 2248.10] and say
[2248.10 → 2248.84] as Christians
[2248.84 → 2249.62] is related
[2249.62 → 2250.76] and connected
[2250.76 → 2252.10] to and affects
[2252.10 → 2253.38] God's choosing
[2253.38 → 2254.00] us
[2254.00 → 2255.76] to image
[2255.76 → 2256.20] him
[2256.20 → 2257.52] to modern
[2257.52 → 2258.00] day
[2258.00 → 2259.06] Ara means.
[2260.70 → 2260.98] Well,
[2261.04 → 2261.96] this whole issue
[2261.96 → 2262.78] gets focused
[2262.78 → 2263.84] in this story
[2263.84 → 2264.64] around the matter
[2264.64 → 2265.18] of giving
[2265.18 → 2266.02] and receiving
[2266.02 → 2266.80] gifts.
[2268.20 → 2268.56] Norman,
[2268.74 → 2269.34] an Ara mean
[2269.34 → 2269.80] general,
[2270.54 → 2271.22] has been healed
[2271.22 → 2271.88] of leprosy,
[2272.44 → 2273.26] a disease back
[2273.26 → 2274.08] then that occasion
[2274.08 → 2275.02] the same reaction
[2275.02 → 2276.00] that AIDS
[2276.00 → 2277.58] still gets today.
[2279.36 → 2279.80] It had been
[2279.80 → 2280.46] a close thing,
[2280.58 → 2280.98] mind you,
[2281.30 → 2282.14] because initially
[2282.14 → 2283.08] Norman had not
[2283.08 → 2283.94] been very impressed
[2283.94 → 2284.48] by the man
[2284.48 → 2284.90] of God,
[2285.02 → 2285.46] Elisha.
[2286.32 → 2287.10] For when this
[2287.10 → 2288.50] five-star general
[2288.50 → 2289.78] loaded down
[2289.78 → 2290.32] with gifts
[2290.32 → 2291.34] arrived at
[2291.34 → 2292.00] the prophet's
[2292.00 → 2292.30] home,
[2292.62 → 2293.36] Elisha didn't
[2293.36 → 2294.00] even bother
[2294.00 → 2294.60] to meet him
[2294.60 → 2295.16] personally.
[2296.20 → 2296.58] Instead,
[2296.72 → 2297.20] he simply
[2297.20 → 2297.64] sent out
[2297.64 → 2298.30] a messenger.
[2299.40 → 2299.86] And then
[2299.86 → 2300.76] adding insult
[2300.76 → 2301.46] to injury,
[2302.34 → 2303.14] he was told
[2303.14 → 2304.18] by Elisha's
[2304.18 → 2304.60] messenger
[2304.60 → 2305.88] to go
[2305.88 → 2306.92] wash yourself
[2306.92 → 2307.66] seven times
[2307.66 → 2308.32] in the Jordan,
[2309.96 → 2310.64] the dirty,
[2311.24 → 2311.88] muddy Jordan,
[2312.62 → 2313.70] and your flesh
[2313.70 → 2314.44] will be restored
[2314.44 → 2315.46] and you will
[2315.46 → 2316.24] be cleansed.
[2316.74 → 2317.86] End of conversation.
[2319.04 → 2320.20] End of prescription.
[2321.98 → 2322.92] Not only
[2322.92 → 2323.62] was Norman
[2323.62 → 2324.46] unimpressed,
[2325.04 → 2326.34] he was offended.
[2327.64 → 2328.16] He would
[2328.16 → 2329.16] never have been
[2329.16 → 2330.02] treated in such
[2330.02 → 2331.32] a cavalier fashion
[2331.32 → 2332.98] by the prophets
[2332.98 → 2333.74] and priests
[2333.74 → 2334.90] of his gods
[2334.90 → 2336.04] back in Arm.
[2337.56 → 2338.04] And so
[2338.04 → 2338.76] his dignity
[2338.76 → 2339.64] upset by
[2339.64 → 2340.54] Elisha's
[2340.54 → 2341.42] inconsiderate
[2341.42 → 2342.24] treatment of him,
[2342.74 → 2343.46] his mind
[2343.46 → 2344.36] scornful of
[2344.36 → 2344.82] the simple
[2344.82 → 2345.46] solution
[2345.46 → 2346.64] offered for
[2346.64 → 2347.32] his sickness,
[2348.12 → 2348.52] Norman
[2348.52 → 2349.44] left in a
[2349.44 → 2349.80] huff
[2349.80 → 2351.10] to seek
[2351.10 → 2351.54] a second
[2351.54 → 2352.02] opinion
[2352.02 → 2352.82] elsewhere.
[2354.24 → 2354.70] But
[2354.70 → 2356.10] cooler heads
[2356.10 → 2356.90] prevailed.
[2358.16 → 2358.80] My father
[2358.80 → 2359.88] said one
[2359.88 → 2360.54] of his own
[2360.54 → 2361.00] servants,
[2361.58 → 2362.56] if the prophet
[2362.56 → 2363.38] had told you
[2363.38 → 2364.02] to do some
[2364.02 → 2364.92] great thing,
[2366.14 → 2366.64] would you not
[2366.64 → 2367.18] have done it?
[2367.72 → 2368.28] How much
[2368.28 → 2368.78] more
[2368.78 → 2369.96] than when
[2369.96 → 2370.74] he tells you
[2370.74 → 2371.82] simply
[2371.82 → 2372.58] wash
[2372.58 → 2373.52] and be
[2373.52 → 2374.12] cleansed?
[2375.22 → 2376.30] If the prophet
[2376.30 → 2376.78] had said,
[2377.26 → 2377.68] take seven
[2377.68 → 2378.48] bales of hay
[2378.48 → 2379.28] and chew them
[2379.28 → 2379.96] carefully for
[2379.96 → 2380.68] seven days,
[2380.92 → 2381.40] then climb
[2381.40 → 2382.20] seven mountains
[2382.20 → 2382.92] and cross
[2382.92 → 2383.72] seven seas
[2383.72 → 2384.50] and bring me
[2384.50 → 2385.26] back the pearl
[2385.26 → 2385.88] of an ox,
[2386.30 → 2386.64] wouldn't you
[2386.64 → 2387.02] have given
[2387.02 → 2387.66] that a shot?
[2387.66 → 2389.78] If you
[2389.78 → 2390.00] would have
[2390.00 → 2390.52] tried something
[2390.52 → 2391.40] difficult and
[2391.40 → 2391.96] impossible,
[2392.60 → 2393.48] why not
[2393.48 → 2394.70] something simple?
[2397.20 → 2397.64] So
[2397.64 → 2398.10] Norman
[2398.10 → 2398.86] went down
[2398.86 → 2399.16] to the
[2399.16 → 2399.50] Jordan,
[2400.72 → 2401.10] did as
[2401.10 → 2401.74] Elisha's
[2401.74 → 2402.10] messenger
[2402.10 → 2402.72] had said,
[2403.42 → 2404.06] and lo
[2404.06 → 2404.62] and behold,
[2405.28 → 2406.02] his flesh
[2406.02 → 2406.80] was restored
[2406.80 → 2407.44] and became
[2407.44 → 2408.06] like that
[2408.06 → 2409.12] of a young
[2409.12 → 2409.44] boy.
[2411.04 → 2411.74] Arriving at
[2411.74 → 2412.58] Elisha's house
[2412.58 → 2413.16] this time
[2413.16 → 2413.80] and finding
[2413.80 → 2414.32] him at
[2414.32 → 2414.74] home,
[2414.74 → 2416.72] he confessed
[2416.72 → 2417.06] to the
[2417.06 → 2417.44] man of
[2417.44 → 2417.98] God that
[2417.98 → 2418.72] he now
[2418.72 → 2419.94] knew that
[2419.94 → 2420.52] there is
[2420.52 → 2421.48] no God
[2421.48 → 2421.94] in all
[2421.94 → 2422.50] the world
[2422.50 → 2425.28] except in
[2425.28 → 2425.68] Israel.
[2427.24 → 2427.96] But he
[2427.96 → 2429.50] figured even
[2429.50 → 2431.08] God must
[2431.08 → 2431.44] have his
[2431.44 → 2431.86] price.
[2433.32 → 2433.56] And so
[2433.56 → 2433.96] he added
[2433.96 → 2434.44] the words,
[2435.04 → 2435.62] so please
[2435.62 → 2436.46] accept a
[2436.46 → 2437.18] gift from
[2437.18 → 2437.62] your servant.
[2439.26 → 2440.08] He offered
[2440.08 → 2441.76] Elisha a
[2441.76 → 2442.06] gift,
[2443.06 → 2443.52] which was
[2443.52 → 2444.24] flatly,
[2444.84 → 2445.64] steadfastly
[2445.64 → 2446.62] refused.
[2447.66 → 2448.00] But
[2448.00 → 2448.60] Norman
[2448.60 → 2449.76] was annoyingly
[2449.76 → 2450.28] persistent,
[2450.80 → 2451.08] forcing
[2451.08 → 2452.06] Elisha to
[2452.06 → 2453.14] finally declare
[2453.14 → 2453.94] on oath,
[2454.44 → 2455.12] as surely
[2455.12 → 2455.64] as the
[2455.64 → 2456.36] Lord lives,
[2457.46 → 2457.90] whom I
[2457.90 → 2458.36] serve,
[2459.00 → 2459.44] I will
[2459.44 → 2460.56] not accept
[2460.56 → 2461.48] a thing.
[2463.16 → 2464.46] And that
[2464.46 → 2465.54] just did
[2465.54 → 2466.22] not add
[2466.22 → 2466.74] up in
[2466.74 → 2467.28] the mind
[2467.28 → 2468.16] of Ghazi,
[2468.48 → 2469.16] Elisha's
[2469.16 → 2469.98] right-hand
[2469.98 → 2470.56] man.
[2470.56 → 2472.78] So when
[2472.78 → 2473.46] Norman left
[2473.46 → 2474.02] to return
[2474.02 → 2474.36] home,
[2474.56 → 2475.06] Ghazi
[2475.06 → 2476.08] said to
[2476.08 → 2476.54] himself,
[2476.80 → 2477.52] reversing
[2477.52 → 2478.86] Elisha's
[2478.86 → 2479.18] oath,
[2479.64 → 2480.40] as surely
[2480.40 → 2480.94] as the
[2480.94 → 2481.70] Lord lives,
[2482.70 → 2483.44] I will
[2483.44 → 2483.92] run after
[2483.92 → 2485.14] him and
[2485.14 → 2485.80] get something
[2485.80 → 2486.34] from him.
[2488.12 → 2489.02] When he's
[2489.02 → 2489.40] eventually
[2489.40 → 2490.00] confronted
[2490.00 → 2490.98] with his
[2490.98 → 2491.48] sordid
[2491.48 → 2492.06] scheme by
[2492.06 → 2492.66] Elisha,
[2493.34 → 2494.00] notice what
[2494.00 → 2494.62] Elisha
[2494.62 → 2495.24] says.
[2496.88 → 2497.84] He doesn't
[2497.84 → 2498.60] say anything
[2498.60 → 2499.54] about Ghazi's
[2499.54 → 2499.82] greed,
[2500.46 → 2500.96] which was
[2500.96 → 2501.26] sinful.
[2502.42 → 2502.84] It says
[2502.84 → 2503.44] nothing about
[2503.44 → 2503.86] his lie,
[2503.98 → 2504.36] which God
[2504.36 → 2505.12] equally hates.
[2506.40 → 2507.20] But only
[2507.20 → 2508.00] this fact.
[2509.20 → 2509.88] Is this
[2509.88 → 2510.68] the time
[2510.68 → 2511.56] to take
[2511.56 → 2511.94] money,
[2512.52 → 2512.98] or to
[2512.98 → 2513.38] accept
[2513.38 → 2513.86] clothes,
[2514.04 → 2514.32] olive
[2514.32 → 2514.72] groves,
[2515.06 → 2515.66] vineyards,
[2516.16 → 2516.58] herds,
[2516.66 → 2517.40] or menservants
[2517.40 → 2518.28] and maidservants?
[2519.66 → 2520.44] Isn't that
[2520.44 → 2521.06] an odd
[2521.06 → 2521.38] thing?
[2523.10 → 2523.58] Ghazi
[2523.58 → 2524.72] was punished
[2524.72 → 2525.66] not for
[2525.66 → 2526.28] accepting
[2526.28 → 2526.72] the Elisha
[2526.72 → 2527.50] gifts as
[2527.50 → 2527.82] such,
[2528.60 → 2529.26] but for
[2529.26 → 2529.76] his poor
[2529.76 → 2530.24] sense of
[2530.24 → 2530.64] timing.
[2532.86 → 2533.70] It makes
[2533.70 → 2534.08] you wonder
[2534.08 → 2534.36] then,
[2534.86 → 2535.50] how is
[2535.50 → 2535.92] a person
[2535.92 → 2536.42] to know
[2536.42 → 2537.00] the right
[2537.00 → 2537.92] and wrong
[2537.92 → 2539.16] time for
[2539.16 → 2539.62] receiving
[2539.62 → 2540.04] gifts?
[2543.84 → 2544.64] So let's
[2544.64 → 2544.94] take a
[2544.94 → 2545.46] little closer
[2545.46 → 2545.92] look at
[2545.92 → 2546.52] Ghazi's
[2546.52 → 2547.00] part in
[2547.00 → 2547.46] the story.
[2548.20 → 2548.54] How
[2548.54 → 2549.36] disappointed
[2549.36 → 2550.06] he was
[2550.06 → 2550.50] to see
[2550.50 → 2551.10] Elisha
[2551.10 → 2551.74] refuse
[2551.74 → 2552.42] Norman's
[2552.42 → 2552.84] gifts.
[2553.92 → 2554.08] A
[2554.08 → 2554.54] disappointment
[2554.54 → 2554.92] at least
[2554.92 → 2555.52] partly due
[2555.52 → 2556.20] to his
[2556.20 → 2557.06] nationalism.
[2557.66 → 2557.92] After
[2557.92 → 2558.22] all,
[2558.28 → 2558.62] Norman
[2558.62 → 2559.20] commanded
[2559.20 → 2559.74] the army
[2559.74 → 2559.96] of
[2559.96 → 2560.32] Arm,
[2560.64 → 2561.16] an enemy
[2561.16 → 2561.46] of
[2561.46 → 2561.86] Israel.
[2561.86 → 2562.88] And remember
[2562.88 → 2563.30] that the
[2563.30 → 2563.86] young girl
[2563.86 → 2564.22] who had
[2564.22 → 2564.54] told
[2564.54 → 2564.90] Norman
[2564.90 → 2565.24] about
[2565.24 → 2565.80] Elisha
[2565.80 → 2566.56] was an
[2566.56 → 2567.24] Israelite
[2567.24 → 2567.54] who had
[2567.54 → 2568.00] been taken
[2568.00 → 2568.56] captive
[2568.56 → 2569.36] and now
[2569.36 → 2569.82] served
[2569.82 → 2570.36] Norman's
[2570.36 → 2570.76] wife.
[2572.14 → 2573.00] Why should
[2573.00 → 2573.80] Norman be
[2573.80 → 2574.22] healed?
[2574.36 → 2574.74] Ghazi
[2574.74 → 2575.28] figured
[2575.28 → 2576.22] for free.
[2577.82 → 2578.20] My
[2578.20 → 2578.70] master,
[2578.84 → 2579.20] Ghazi
[2579.20 → 2579.70] said,
[2579.96 → 2580.46] was too
[2580.46 → 2581.20] easy on
[2581.20 → 2581.70] Norman,
[2582.14 → 2582.44] this
[2582.44 → 2583.44] Ara mean.
[2583.44 → 2584.80] Can't
[2584.80 → 2585.08] you hear
[2585.08 → 2585.78] the contempt
[2585.78 → 2586.60] dripping
[2586.60 → 2587.18] from those
[2587.18 → 2587.80] last two
[2587.80 → 2588.14] words,
[2588.26 → 2588.50] this
[2588.50 → 2589.42] Ara mean?
[2592.82 → 2593.64] But even
[2593.64 → 2594.04] if there's
[2594.04 → 2594.52] a little
[2594.52 → 2594.92] something
[2594.92 → 2595.48] about his
[2595.48 → 2596.52] patriotism
[2596.52 → 2597.08] you could
[2597.08 → 2597.68] respect,
[2598.78 → 2599.76] that quickly
[2599.76 → 2600.52] disappears
[2600.52 → 2601.74] in the face
[2601.74 → 2602.88] of Ghazi's
[2602.88 → 2603.66] basic
[2603.66 → 2604.50] instinct,
[2605.34 → 2605.90] his greed.
[2605.90 → 2608.40] Because at
[2608.40 → 2609.02] bottom it
[2609.02 → 2609.54] was his
[2609.54 → 2610.06] love for
[2610.06 → 2610.48] all the
[2610.48 → 2610.96] things that
[2610.96 → 2611.44] money can
[2611.44 → 2611.98] buy that
[2611.98 → 2613.12] overshadow any
[2613.12 → 2614.10] wonder he
[2614.10 → 2614.60] should have
[2614.60 → 2616.04] had on
[2616.04 → 2616.68] the love of
[2616.68 → 2617.74] God expressed
[2617.74 → 2619.92] even to
[2619.92 → 2620.66] his enemies.
[2622.28 → 2623.10] All he
[2623.10 → 2623.68] saw when
[2623.68 → 2624.44] Elisha said
[2624.44 → 2625.30] now was the
[2625.30 → 2625.94] disappearing
[2625.94 → 2626.58] riches of
[2626.58 → 2627.08] Norman's
[2627.08 → 2628.50] caravan and
[2628.50 → 2629.16] his chances
[2629.16 → 2629.68] of a more
[2629.68 → 2630.32] comfortable,
[2631.00 → 2631.66] cozy life.
[2633.06 → 2633.56] What a
[2633.56 → 2634.44] fool Elisha
[2634.44 → 2634.78] was.
[2634.98 → 2635.52] But Ghazi
[2635.52 → 2636.04] was no
[2636.04 → 2636.34] fool.
[2637.30 → 2637.68] And when
[2637.68 → 2637.92] he is
[2637.92 → 2638.44] alone and
[2638.44 → 2638.82] he thinks
[2638.82 → 2639.54] unobserved
[2639.54 → 2639.96] and he's
[2639.96 → 2640.26] got a
[2640.26 → 2640.74] story about
[2640.74 → 2641.22] Elisha
[2641.22 → 2642.20] suddenly getting
[2642.20 → 2642.80] unexpected
[2642.80 → 2643.94] guests ready
[2643.94 → 2644.54] in his
[2644.54 → 2644.98] mind,
[2645.32 → 2645.74] he hurries
[2645.74 → 2646.66] after Norman
[2646.66 → 2647.00] who was
[2647.00 → 2647.62] only too
[2647.62 → 2648.04] pleased.
[2648.32 → 2648.72] He can do
[2648.72 → 2649.28] something and
[2649.28 → 2649.76] return for
[2649.76 → 2650.20] his healing.
[2651.08 → 2651.64] So Ghazi
[2651.64 → 2652.64] returns home
[2652.64 → 2653.46] a rich man
[2653.46 → 2654.46] with two
[2654.46 → 2655.06] talents of
[2655.06 → 2655.62] silver, a
[2655.62 → 2656.08] pile of
[2656.08 → 2656.58] money back
[2656.58 → 2657.98] then, and
[2657.98 → 2658.66] enough new
[2658.66 → 2659.26] clothes to
[2659.26 → 2659.72] dress the
[2659.72 → 2660.00] part.
[2661.30 → 2661.72] But of
[2661.72 → 2662.68] course he
[2662.68 → 2663.06] couldn't let
[2663.06 → 2663.46] himself get
[2663.46 → 2664.12] carried away.
[2664.82 → 2665.46] Elisha must
[2665.46 → 2666.00] not know.
[2666.42 → 2666.64] He would
[2666.64 → 2666.92] have to
[2666.92 → 2667.32] bide his
[2667.32 → 2668.04] time and
[2668.04 → 2668.42] then think
[2668.42 → 2668.86] of another
[2668.86 → 2669.52] good story
[2669.52 → 2670.10] to explain
[2670.10 → 2670.64] his newfound
[2670.64 → 2671.06] wealth.
[2671.64 → 2671.96] A rich
[2671.96 → 2672.44] uncle who
[2672.44 → 2673.26] died perhaps.
[2673.76 → 2674.22] Or maybe
[2674.22 → 2675.00] the Ara mean
[2675.00 → 2676.12] 649 lottery.
[2676.12 → 2676.20] story.
[2678.44 → 2679.80] But no sooner
[2679.80 → 2681.10] does Ghazi
[2681.10 → 2681.86] get back to
[2681.86 → 2683.24] Elisha and
[2683.24 → 2683.90] his dreams
[2683.90 → 2684.56] begin to
[2684.56 → 2685.04] unravel.
[2686.44 → 2687.26] Where have
[2687.26 → 2687.62] you have been,
[2687.84 → 2688.14] Ghazi?
[2689.42 → 2690.24] And with
[2690.24 → 2690.70] all the
[2690.70 → 2691.30] innocence he
[2691.30 → 2691.94] can muster,
[2692.56 → 2692.98] Ghazi
[2692.98 → 2693.66] answers,
[2694.34 → 2695.02] your servant
[2695.02 → 2695.78] didn't go
[2695.78 → 2696.18] anywhere.
[2697.30 → 2698.12] Maybe you've
[2698.12 → 2698.68] had that kind
[2698.68 → 2699.36] of conversation
[2699.36 → 2700.08] with the
[2700.08 → 2700.68] teenager who
[2700.68 → 2701.26] came home
[2701.26 → 2701.92] way too
[2701.92 → 2702.26] late at
[2702.26 → 2702.46] night.
[2702.46 → 2703.74] Or with
[2703.74 → 2704.12] a child
[2704.12 → 2704.58] whose hand
[2704.58 → 2705.04] is covered
[2705.04 → 2705.84] with cookie
[2705.84 → 2706.18] crumbs.
[2707.68 → 2708.44] I imagine
[2708.44 → 2709.02] Elisha
[2709.02 → 2709.98] sighing deeply
[2709.98 → 2710.60] because it's
[2710.60 → 2711.74] all so wrong
[2711.74 → 2712.22] and it's
[2712.22 → 2713.80] all so sad.
[2713.80 → 2716.26] was not my
[2716.26 → 2716.94] spirit with
[2716.94 → 2717.12] you?
[2718.02 → 2718.68] I know
[2718.68 → 2719.10] where you've
[2719.10 → 2719.38] been.
[2720.38 → 2721.18] Was it the
[2721.18 → 2721.80] time to
[2721.80 → 2722.78] take money
[2722.78 → 2723.92] so that you
[2723.92 → 2724.68] could fulfill
[2724.68 → 2725.68] your dreams?
[2726.68 → 2727.82] Now you
[2727.82 → 2728.62] have Norman's
[2728.62 → 2728.92] riches,
[2729.34 → 2730.56] yes, but
[2730.56 → 2731.34] Norman came
[2731.34 → 2731.92] in the first
[2731.92 → 2732.48] place to
[2732.48 → 2732.94] bring not
[2732.94 → 2733.50] his riches
[2733.50 → 2734.52] but his
[2734.52 → 2735.04] leprosy.
[2736.24 → 2736.54] And so
[2736.54 → 2737.40] now you
[2737.40 → 2738.26] will have
[2738.26 → 2738.62] both.
[2740.10 → 2740.64] And Ghazi
[2740.64 → 2741.28] became a
[2741.28 → 2741.48] leper.
[2742.32 → 2742.94] The consequence
[2742.94 → 2743.44] of his
[2743.44 → 2744.44] greedy and
[2744.44 → 2745.50] shady action.
[2747.28 → 2748.14] But okay,
[2748.26 → 2748.88] what is really
[2748.88 → 2749.40] going on
[2749.40 → 2749.60] here?
[2751.10 → 2752.18] Why was it
[2752.18 → 2752.90] not the
[2752.90 → 2753.82] time to
[2753.82 → 2754.80] receive gifts?
[2755.18 → 2755.92] Why was
[2755.92 → 2756.74] the timing
[2756.74 → 2757.30] the real
[2757.30 → 2758.28] issue in
[2758.28 → 2759.08] Ghazi's
[2759.08 → 2759.54] action?
[2761.38 → 2762.34] For this
[2762.34 → 2763.06] simple reason.
[2764.42 → 2765.46] Norman came
[2765.46 → 2766.02] out of
[2766.02 → 2766.94] paganism.
[2768.20 → 2768.64] And in
[2768.64 → 2769.22] the pagan
[2769.22 → 2770.58] religions then
[2770.58 → 2771.42] as well as
[2771.42 → 2771.76] now,
[2771.76 → 2773.88] a person
[2773.88 → 2774.46] could not
[2774.46 → 2775.26] expect the
[2775.26 → 2776.02] services of
[2776.02 → 2776.60] the priests
[2776.60 → 2777.40] or the
[2777.40 → 2778.36] gods without
[2778.36 → 2780.04] paying dearly
[2780.04 → 2780.78] for them.
[2782.24 → 2783.14] In pagan
[2783.14 → 2783.84] theology,
[2784.84 → 2786.24] grace always
[2786.24 → 2787.34] costs you.
[2788.86 → 2789.70] Salvation does
[2789.70 → 2790.62] not come for
[2790.62 → 2791.02] nothing.
[2792.52 → 2793.22] In pagan
[2793.22 → 2794.48] theology, the
[2794.48 → 2795.10] gods don't
[2795.10 → 2795.82] give people who
[2795.82 → 2796.34] come empty
[2796.34 → 2797.10] handed a
[2797.10 → 2797.68] second look.
[2797.68 → 2800.10] Norman came
[2800.10 → 2800.78] loaded with
[2800.78 → 2801.68] gifts because
[2801.68 → 2802.50] his religion
[2802.50 → 2803.06] had taught
[2803.06 → 2803.84] him that in
[2803.84 → 2804.50] order to be
[2804.50 → 2805.10] healed of a
[2805.10 → 2805.74] disease as
[2805.74 → 2806.22] bad as
[2806.22 → 2807.14] leprosy or
[2807.14 → 2807.74] of anything,
[2807.92 → 2808.50] if that was
[2808.50 → 2809.20] possible in the
[2809.20 → 2809.84] first place,
[2810.62 → 2811.42] was not going
[2811.42 → 2812.16] to come at
[2812.16 → 2813.42] bargain-basement
[2813.42 → 2814.36] prices.
[2815.96 → 2817.40] But Norman has
[2817.40 → 2818.10] to learn that
[2818.10 → 2819.00] this is false
[2819.00 → 2819.46] religion.
[2820.40 → 2821.12] That with the
[2821.12 → 2821.98] God of Israel,
[2822.56 → 2823.54] it is radically
[2823.54 → 2824.02] different.
[2824.02 → 2825.66] He has to
[2825.66 → 2826.28] learn that you
[2826.28 → 2827.30] cannot pay for
[2827.30 → 2828.24] God's services.
[2829.00 → 2829.78] God's favour,
[2830.16 → 2831.06] God's favours,
[2831.34 → 2832.32] cannot be bought
[2832.32 → 2833.14] with silver or
[2833.14 → 2833.44] gold.
[2834.26 → 2835.08] You cannot buy
[2835.08 → 2835.82] yourself into
[2835.82 → 2836.90] God's good
[2836.90 → 2837.40] graces.
[2838.50 → 2840.00] Elisha said no
[2840.00 → 2840.86] to Norman's
[2840.86 → 2842.10] gifts to drive
[2842.10 → 2843.36] home this message
[2843.36 → 2844.94] to Norman and
[2844.94 → 2846.34] to Arm and to
[2846.34 → 2847.26] the ends of the
[2847.26 → 2848.80] earth that salvation
[2848.80 → 2851.10] is the gift
[2851.10 → 2852.20] of God and
[2852.20 → 2853.28] cannot be paid
[2853.28 → 2854.54] for and bought.
[2856.10 → 2857.62] And if Norman
[2857.62 → 2859.76] misses that, he
[2859.76 → 2860.78] misses the heart
[2860.78 → 2862.08] of the gospel.
[2863.70 → 2864.90] That was
[2864.90 → 2866.68] Ghazi's terrible
[2866.68 → 2867.12] sin.
[2868.28 → 2869.00] He could not
[2869.00 → 2869.88] stand the
[2869.88 → 2870.82] thought of free
[2870.82 → 2872.76] grace, especially
[2872.76 → 2873.86] not to a Gentile,
[2874.42 → 2875.54] to an outsider.
[2876.82 → 2877.88] In going after
[2877.88 → 2878.92] Norman and asking
[2878.92 → 2880.40] for gifts, he
[2880.40 → 2881.28] put the word of
[2881.28 → 2882.38] Elisha, the man
[2882.38 → 2883.82] of God, in doubt.
[2884.14 → 2885.54] He misrepresents
[2885.54 → 2886.50] the truth of
[2886.50 → 2887.34] what the God of
[2887.34 → 2888.78] Israel is really
[2888.78 → 2889.92] like, a God of
[2889.92 → 2891.38] mercy, and above
[2891.38 → 2892.40] all, a God whose
[2892.40 → 2893.72] relationship with
[2893.72 → 2896.14] his people are
[2896.14 → 2897.06] based not on
[2897.06 → 2898.86] merit, not on
[2898.86 → 2899.58] something that you
[2899.58 → 2900.38] and I could earn,
[2901.08 → 2902.06] but solely,
[2902.40 → 2904.42] entirely, on
[2904.42 → 2906.02] God's grace.
[2906.02 → 2909.56] based on Ghazi's
[2909.56 → 2910.50] action, however,
[2911.08 → 2912.26] Norman can easily
[2912.26 → 2913.64] conclude, again,
[2913.82 → 2914.92] that Israel's God
[2914.92 → 2915.98] is, after all,
[2916.34 → 2917.54] no different from
[2917.54 → 2918.52] the false gods
[2918.52 → 2919.88] of the Ara means.
[2920.88 → 2922.06] Everything in life
[2922.06 → 2923.46] has its price.
[2924.46 → 2925.42] With the God of
[2925.42 → 2926.18] Israel, it would
[2926.18 → 2927.46] seem, as with the
[2927.46 → 2928.24] pagan gods,
[2929.04 → 2929.50] money
[2929.50 → 2930.80] talks.
[2930.80 → 2930.92] grace.
[2933.96 → 2934.86] Of course, you
[2934.86 → 2935.66] and I know it
[2935.66 → 2936.62] isn't easy for any
[2936.62 → 2937.54] of us to live
[2937.54 → 2939.98] from grace, to
[2939.98 → 2940.56] know that the
[2940.56 → 2942.20] only payment for
[2942.20 → 2943.20] our healing is,
[2943.32 → 2943.92] and could ever
[2943.92 → 2945.80] have been, God's
[2945.80 → 2947.16] sacrifice of his
[2947.16 → 2947.72] own son.
[2949.16 → 2950.16] We can understand
[2950.16 → 2951.02] the tendency to
[2951.02 → 2951.72] think that we
[2951.72 → 2952.66] must do something,
[2952.76 → 2953.68] we must pay
[2953.68 → 2954.66] something, we
[2954.66 → 2956.04] must be something
[2956.04 → 2958.52] first, but it's
[2958.52 → 2960.64] all wrong, and
[2960.64 → 2961.22] we know it.
[2961.92 → 2963.00] God's grace in
[2963.00 → 2964.64] Jesus is free, for
[2964.64 → 2965.96] the wages of sin
[2965.96 → 2967.56] is death, but
[2967.56 → 2969.36] the gift of God,
[2969.74 → 2971.22] the gift of God,
[2971.88 → 2973.22] is eternal life in
[2973.22 → 2974.52] Christ Jesus, our
[2974.52 → 2974.78] Lord.
[2976.48 → 2977.78] As someone once
[2977.78 → 2978.76] put it, the
[2978.76 → 2979.50] difference between
[2979.50 → 2981.06] Christianity and
[2981.06 → 2982.18] every other
[2982.18 → 2983.34] religion in the
[2983.34 → 2984.34] world, you name
[2984.34 → 2985.92] it, can be stated
[2985.92 → 2986.84] in two words.
[2986.84 → 2989.98] doing versus
[2989.98 → 2990.96] done.
[2992.14 → 2993.70] In every world
[2993.70 → 2994.98] religion, in every
[2994.98 → 2996.00] sect and cult,
[2996.18 → 2997.32] there is, there is
[2997.32 → 2998.60] something you must
[2998.60 → 3000.22] do to earn
[3000.22 → 3000.74] salvation.
[3000.90 → 3001.44] There is some
[3001.44 → 3002.82] obedience, some
[3002.82 → 3004.12] service, some price
[3004.12 → 3005.40] to pay to be
[3005.40 → 3006.56] worthy of receiving
[3006.56 → 3009.34] divine favour, but
[3009.34 → 3011.32] not in the
[3011.32 → 3011.98] Christian faith.
[3012.90 → 3013.82] In the Christian
[3013.82 → 3015.74] faith, all that is
[3015.74 → 3016.72] done.
[3016.84 → 3019.10] first by promise,
[3019.64 → 3020.86] then by fulfillment
[3020.86 → 3023.08] in God's son.
[3024.56 → 3026.30] God's favour is by
[3026.30 → 3028.00] grace alone, in
[3028.00 → 3029.28] Christ, through
[3029.28 → 3030.74] faith, through
[3030.74 → 3031.92] holding out empty
[3031.92 → 3033.56] hands, empty
[3033.56 → 3035.38] hands, to receive
[3035.38 → 3036.24] what you and I
[3036.24 → 3037.46] could never achieve
[3037.46 → 3038.60] or earn.
[3040.60 → 3041.80] Ghazi's action
[3041.80 → 3042.62] took the good
[3042.62 → 3044.54] news, stripped the
[3044.54 → 3045.92] gospel of the good
[3045.92 → 3046.28] news.
[3047.64 → 3048.88] God reveals the
[3048.88 → 3049.78] glory of his
[3049.78 → 3050.54] grace to
[3050.54 → 3052.64] Norman, and
[3052.64 → 3053.82] Ghazi, in his
[3053.82 → 3055.36] greed, tramples
[3055.36 → 3056.48] that glory into
[3056.48 → 3057.74] the mud of the
[3057.74 → 3058.36] Jordan River.
[3059.54 → 3060.72] He misrepresents
[3060.72 → 3062.30] the character and
[3062.30 → 3063.48] the being of God.
[3064.52 → 3065.40] Desiring the life
[3065.40 → 3066.36] of Norman, instead
[3066.36 → 3067.92] of life in God, he
[3067.92 → 3069.16] gets Norman's life,
[3069.80 → 3071.80] all of it, both his
[3071.80 → 3073.66] wealth and his
[3073.66 → 3074.18] leprosy.
[3076.60 → 3077.56] What about his
[3077.56 → 3077.82] greed?
[3078.82 → 3079.70] What about his
[3079.70 → 3079.98] lying?
[3081.26 → 3081.92] Aren't they worth
[3081.92 → 3082.32] mentioning?
[3083.70 → 3085.22] Sure, but these are
[3085.22 → 3086.24] secondary matters.
[3087.06 → 3088.30] Primary was what they
[3088.30 → 3089.50] revealed to Norman
[3089.50 → 3090.96] about God.
[3090.96 → 3093.20] the primary matter
[3093.20 → 3094.26] for any of us
[3094.26 → 3095.06] is how our
[3095.06 → 3095.66] actions,
[3096.32 → 3097.36] especially our
[3097.36 → 3099.02] sinful actions,
[3099.78 → 3101.16] reflect on the
[3101.16 → 3102.32] God we claim to
[3102.32 → 3103.14] love and serve.
[3104.32 → 3105.50] Our conduct as
[3105.50 → 3106.28] Christians, the way
[3106.28 → 3107.32] we speak and act as
[3107.32 → 3108.48] God's people, the way
[3108.48 → 3109.58] we live in relationship
[3109.58 → 3110.44] to others and to
[3110.44 → 3111.70] God, can never be
[3111.70 → 3112.76] seen in isolation.
[3113.88 → 3114.72] We don't live for
[3114.72 → 3115.52] ourselves as
[3115.52 → 3115.94] Christians.
[3116.90 → 3118.02] Everything we do is
[3118.02 → 3119.04] connected to and
[3119.04 → 3120.52] affects God's purpose
[3120.52 → 3121.20] in his world,
[3121.56 → 3122.62] especially God's
[3122.62 → 3123.54] purpose in choosing
[3123.54 → 3125.12] us as Christians, in
[3125.12 → 3126.88] choosing you and
[3126.88 → 3128.68] choosing me to
[3128.68 → 3130.32] represent him to
[3130.32 → 3132.34] the pagans of our
[3132.34 → 3133.78] culture and our
[3133.78 → 3134.10] world.
[3135.30 → 3136.52] Our lives as
[3136.52 → 3137.44] Christians is like
[3137.44 → 3138.40] that undergarment
[3138.40 → 3139.38] that Jesus wore.
[3140.08 → 3140.96] Remember that the
[3140.96 → 3141.72] soldiers gambled
[3141.72 → 3142.96] away at the cross,
[3143.62 → 3145.50] seamless, woven in
[3145.50 → 3146.50] one piece from top
[3146.50 → 3147.10] to bottom.
[3148.38 → 3149.68] Ghazi's lie and
[3149.68 → 3150.30] greed,
[3150.52 → 3151.94] like a stone thrown
[3151.94 → 3154.30] into a pond, had a
[3154.30 → 3155.68] much broader effect.
[3156.30 → 3157.60] Ghazi's action sent
[3157.60 → 3158.84] ripples across the
[3158.84 → 3160.14] water of God's plan
[3160.14 → 3161.40] of salvation, not
[3161.40 → 3162.72] only for Israel, but
[3162.72 → 3163.82] for all the nations.
[3165.30 → 3166.74] Ghazi's lie was not
[3166.74 → 3167.84] merely a lie.
[3168.66 → 3169.82] It blocked the
[3169.82 → 3171.08] progress of the
[3171.08 → 3171.46] gospel.
[3172.92 → 3174.44] In the same way, a
[3174.44 → 3176.84] person, a family, a
[3176.84 → 3178.44] church, in the way
[3178.44 → 3179.54] that we live in our
[3179.54 → 3181.44] actions, affect not
[3181.44 → 3182.50] only ourselves, but
[3182.50 → 3184.42] the very purposes of
[3184.42 → 3184.78] God.
[3185.32 → 3186.56] Everything we either do
[3186.56 → 3188.42] or say or don't do or
[3188.42 → 3189.90] don't say either stands
[3189.90 → 3191.08] in the way of the
[3191.08 → 3191.82] coming of God's
[3191.82 → 3194.38] kingdom or serves to
[3194.38 → 3195.16] hasten its coming.
[3195.16 → 3197.46] For example, when a
[3197.46 → 3200.08] televangelist is known to
[3200.08 → 3202.64] be a person of wealth, and
[3202.64 → 3204.38] in every program his main
[3204.38 → 3207.28] appeal is for funds, he
[3207.28 → 3210.00] blocks the very gospel he
[3210.00 → 3210.48] preaches.
[3211.58 → 3213.26] When a pastor or an elder,
[3214.10 → 3215.40] in spite of good sermons or
[3215.40 → 3216.70] sound leadership, shows by
[3216.70 → 3218.30] his life that he comes to be
[3218.30 → 3219.68] served rather than to serve,
[3220.56 → 3222.50] the light of the gospel is
[3222.50 → 3222.94] dimmed.
[3224.14 → 3226.08] When a congregation acts as
[3226.08 → 3227.52] if her election or
[3227.52 → 3229.36] choosing as God's people is
[3229.36 → 3230.48] the end of her involvement
[3230.48 → 3232.46] with the world rather than
[3232.46 → 3233.06] the beginning,
[3235.22 → 3236.72] forgetting that to be
[3236.72 → 3239.76] chosen is to serve, then
[3239.76 → 3241.62] that congregation falsifies
[3241.62 → 3242.32] the gospel.
[3243.64 → 3245.32] When a Christian employer's
[3245.32 → 3248.24] only concern is profit, or a
[3248.24 → 3249.42] Christian employee's only
[3249.42 → 3250.70] concern is his or her
[3250.70 → 3252.48] paycheck, and neither cares
[3252.48 → 3254.26] about doing a good job or
[3254.26 → 3255.56] promoting good relationships,
[3256.06 → 3258.02] then he or she blocks the
[3258.02 → 3259.64] progress of the gospel.
[3261.24 → 3262.74] When you and I show
[3262.74 → 3264.72] disrespect, not disagreement
[3264.72 → 3266.48] necessarily, but disrespect
[3266.48 → 3268.76] for our parents, or our
[3268.76 → 3270.30] government, or anyone in
[3270.30 → 3272.10] authority, then we give a
[3272.10 → 3274.06] false impression to others
[3274.06 → 3275.56] of who God is.
[3276.84 → 3278.16] When you drive like the
[3278.16 → 3279.38] devil while your car has a
[3279.38 → 3280.66] bumper sticker declaring that
[3280.66 → 3282.36] Jesus is Lord, or ask you to
[3282.36 → 3284.18] honk if you love Jesus, then
[3284.18 → 3285.76] you turn Jesus into a
[3285.76 → 3288.16] curse word rather than a
[3288.16 → 3288.62] confession.
[3290.32 → 3291.62] When you and I cannot be
[3291.62 → 3293.20] trusted in our dealings with
[3293.20 → 3294.66] other people, we give the
[3294.66 → 3295.76] clear impression to
[3295.76 → 3297.46] unbelievers that knowing and
[3297.46 → 3299.64] loving God makes you no
[3299.64 → 3301.16] different from anybody else,
[3301.82 → 3305.00] that God doesn't care, and you
[3305.00 → 3306.26] might as well serve some other
[3306.26 → 3306.56] God.
[3306.56 → 3310.24] You get the point, right?
[3311.14 → 3313.82] That's the awful nature of sin.
[3313.94 → 3315.08] We never sin.
[3315.62 → 3317.26] We never break God's
[3317.26 → 3319.14] commandments just for
[3319.14 → 3319.76] ourselves.
[3320.18 → 3321.46] And in that light, let's be
[3321.46 → 3323.32] honest, what do any of us have
[3323.32 → 3325.64] but a record of all too often
[3325.64 → 3328.96] working against rather than with
[3328.96 → 3332.76] God's purposes in and for and
[3332.76 → 3334.44] through our lives?
[3334.44 → 3337.76] When we add up our greed, our
[3337.76 → 3339.06] lying on top of everything
[3339.06 → 3342.04] else, what does it add up to
[3342.04 → 3343.92] but a frustrating of the truth
[3343.92 → 3346.96] of the gospel far too often in
[3346.96 → 3347.70] our own lives?
[3351.54 → 3353.10] And if that was the end of the
[3353.10 → 3356.06] story, but now you need to
[3356.06 → 3357.30] remember two things.
[3358.70 → 3361.60] One is the simple, never-to-be-
[3361.60 → 3363.20] forgotten truth of the gospel.
[3364.20 → 3367.22] That just as no sales slip came
[3367.22 → 3370.52] with Norman's cure, so the grace
[3370.52 → 3373.74] of God in the sacrifice of Jesus is
[3373.74 → 3375.80] not up for sale.
[3377.28 → 3380.90] There is no price on God's healing
[3380.90 → 3383.98] mercy, on God's forgiving love for
[3383.98 → 3387.64] you, except the price of Christ which
[3387.64 → 3390.52] has been paid for all our sins.
[3391.02 → 3393.52] Nothing, as we sang, but the blood of
[3393.52 → 3393.82] Jesus.
[3395.04 → 3398.70] God's grace is not, could never be
[3398.70 → 3401.82] because of our doing, but because of
[3401.82 → 3403.04] what Christ has done.
[3404.84 → 3406.34] The second thing is this.
[3407.04 → 3409.30] While God's grace does not come with a
[3409.30 → 3411.36] price tag, it is not cheap.
[3411.36 → 3415.78] Love so amazing, so divine, costs God
[3415.78 → 3417.62] the life of his son and demands
[3417.62 → 3420.70] nothing less than my life, my all.
[3421.80 → 3424.50] Demands nothing less than that there
[3424.50 → 3427.78] may be a footnote to our stories,
[3428.16 → 3430.76] just as there is to the story of
[3430.76 → 3431.54] Ghazi.
[3432.90 → 3435.24] Yes, there's a footnote, and you find
[3435.24 → 3437.38] that footnote in 2 Kings chapter 8.
[3437.38 → 3441.00] The king of Israel is talking to
[3441.00 → 3444.04] Ghazi, and he says to Ghazi,
[3444.42 → 3446.76] tell me about all the great things
[3446.76 → 3447.62] Elisha has done.
[3448.88 → 3451.08] And just at the moment that he was
[3451.08 → 3453.50] telling the king how Elisha had once
[3453.50 → 3456.20] restored a widow's dead son to life,
[3456.80 → 3459.30] that widow at that moment arrived at
[3459.30 → 3461.66] the king's house along with her son,
[3462.04 → 3464.28] and that's another story, and Ghazi
[3464.28 → 3467.36] said, this is the woman my lord
[3467.36 → 3470.14] the king, and this is her son, whom
[3470.14 → 3472.42] Elisha restored to life.
[3473.74 → 3476.30] On this occasion, Ghazi did not
[3476.30 → 3479.54] stand in God's way, but was God's
[3479.54 → 3482.80] instrument in declaring God's goodness
[3482.80 → 3484.36] and God's grace.
[3485.98 → 3489.18] And so, you and I as Christians also
[3489.18 → 3492.06] have a story to tell of the goodness
[3492.06 → 3494.62] and the grace of the Lord, of the
[3494.62 → 3496.48] riches of his love in Christ Jesus
[3496.48 → 3499.90] that we celebrate together every Sunday.
[3500.90 → 3503.86] A love that God freely offers also
[3503.86 → 3506.86] through us to all who come to him in
[3506.86 → 3510.24] faith and repentance with empty hands.
[3510.24 → 3516.08] Let us be determined then, anew this week, to live
[3516.08 → 3520.40] thankfully, graciously, and freely out of that love
[3520.40 → 3521.98] and live for him.
[3523.08 → 3526.90] After all, the modern version of the Ara means
[3526.90 → 3530.20] must get the right impression, right?
[3530.20 → 3534.54] In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[3535.12 → 3535.76] Let's pray.
[3536.76 → 3538.18] Gracious God, we thank you
[3538.18 → 3541.06] that you are a gracious God.
[3542.76 → 3546.10] We recognize and acknowledge that we are your children
[3546.10 → 3548.74] by the blood of Jesus alone.
[3548.74 → 3553.24] Forgive us when we block the truth of grace,
[3553.84 → 3556.00] when we block the good news of the gospel
[3556.00 → 3558.36] by our words or by our actions,
[3558.94 → 3560.68] and lead us by your Holy Spirit
[3560.68 → 3563.58] to make a fresh start again this week
[3563.58 → 3567.18] as we, in dependence on you,
[3568.30 → 3570.46] do our best to faithfully reflect
[3570.46 → 3573.46] your love and your goodness to us
[3573.46 → 3574.48] in Christ Jesus.
[3574.80 → 3575.82] In his name we pray.
[3576.60 → 3576.92] Amen.
[3578.74 → 3580.74] Amen.
[3608.74 → 3621.74] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[3621.74 → 3626.74] that saved a wretch like me.
[3628.36 → 3634.94] I once was lost, but now am found.
[3634.94 → 3639.94] Was blind, but now I see.
[3639.94 → 3647.94] Was grace that taught my heart to fear,
[3647.94 → 3653.94] that grace my fears relieved.
[3653.94 → 3660.94] How precious did that grace appear,
[3660.94 → 3666.94] the hour I first believed.
[3666.94 → 3673.94] My chains are gone, I've been set free.
[3673.94 → 3681.94] My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me.
[3681.94 → 3688.94] When life of love, his mercy raised.
[3688.94 → 3694.94] My name is God, amazing grace.
[3694.94 → 3695.94] The Lord has promised good to me.
[3695.94 → 3711.94] His word my hopes endures.
[3711.94 → 3718.94] He will my shield and portion be,
[3718.94 → 3724.94] As long as life endures.
[3724.94 → 3732.94] Through many dangers, doors and snares,
[3732.94 → 3737.94] I have already come.
[3737.94 → 3739.94] His grace have brought me safe,
[3739.94 → 3744.94] His grace have brought me safe, that star,
[3744.94 → 3750.94] And grace will lead me home.
[3750.94 → 3757.94] My chains are gone, I've been set free.
[3757.94 → 3763.94] My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me.
[3763.94 → 3773.94] And like a flower, his mercy raised.
[3773.94 → 3780.94] An epic love, amazing grace.
[3780.94 → 3789.94] When we live in the air, ten thousand years,
[3789.94 → 3796.94] Bright shining as the sun.
[3796.94 → 3804.94] With almost days to sing God's praise,
[3804.94 → 3814.94] And when we first begin home.
[3834.94 → 3840.94] At this time, let's come together,
[3840.94 → 3842.94] As a community of Christians,
[3842.94 → 3844.94] In our community prayer this morning,
[3844.94 → 3848.94] As we approach our God.
[3848.94 → 3850.94] Dear God, as we come to you this morning,
[3850.94 → 3852.94] We say, you are the almighty,
[3852.94 → 3855.94] The true and incomparable God.
[3855.94 → 3857.94] You are present in all things,
[3857.94 → 3859.94] Yet in no way limited by them.
[3859.94 → 3861.94] You remain unaffected by place,
[3861.94 → 3864.94] Untouched by time,
[3864.94 → 3865.94] Unaffected by years,
[3865.94 → 3868.94] And undeceived by words.
[3868.94 → 3869.94] You are unseen,
[3869.94 → 3871.94] Yet you are known to all those
[3871.94 → 3873.94] Who seek you with hope and love.
[3873.94 → 3876.94] You are the God of Abraham,
[3876.94 → 3877.94] The God of Israel,
[3877.94 → 3879.94] And now God of us,
[3879.94 → 3882.94] And all who hope in Christ.
[3882.94 → 3884.94] We praise you for being our God,
[3884.94 → 3887.94] Because of the incredible grace to us,
[3887.94 → 3890.94] That we can enter your presence,
[3890.94 → 3893.94] To be considered sinless.
[3893.94 → 3895.94] We need only to believe in Jesus,
[3895.94 → 3896.94] And the way of salvation.
[3896.94 → 3897.94] We do confess that,
[3897.94 → 3900.94] And we thank you for,
[3900.94 → 3903.94] To whom else would we return to this morning?
[3903.94 → 3906.94] We thank you for freedom to worship here this morning,
[3906.94 → 3908.94] And in fact any other time,
[3908.94 → 3910.94] At any other place.
[3910.94 → 3912.94] For giving us a wonderful world,
[3912.94 → 3914.94] A change of seasons,
[3914.94 → 3915.94] A good summer,
[3915.94 → 3917.94] A good weather.
[3917.94 → 3924.94] In thinking of the reason that we are meeting separately this morning,
[3924.94 → 3929.94] We pray for a quick removal of this COVID-19 plague.
[3929.94 → 3937.94] Until then, grant us patience and a spirit of compliance with the best practices that are being told to us.
[3937.94 → 3944.94] Guide and empower those research scientists as they devise effective vaccines,
[3944.94 → 3946.94] Therapeutics, and tests.
[3946.94 → 3950.94] Give them a strong and bold voice as they tell us what's best for us.
[3950.94 → 3954.94] We pray the same for the health officers that relay that information.
[3954.94 → 3958.94] May their voices be always heard powerfully,
[3958.94 → 3968.94] Even when I fear some government leaders at times try to use the pandemic and misinformation for short-term political gain.
[3968.94 → 3975.94] Bless the doctors as they treat patients and discover the best ways to minimize or eliminate the effects of these virus infections.
[3975.94 → 3981.94] Protect our medical workers as they come in close contact with those who are infected.
[3981.94 → 3993.94] We ask guidance for our provincial and federal leaders as they reallocate resources and our tax dollars to best address the needs for our health and safety.
[3993.94 → 3995.94] Protect us and our loved ones from this disease.
[3995.94 → 4002.94] We are especially mindful of our older members living in care homes who have health issues.
[4002.94 → 4007.94] Please inspire decision makers that plan for the education of our students in the coming school year,
[4007.94 → 4011.94] which begins a few short days from now.
[4011.94 → 4015.94] May we have safe but still effective methods of teaching.
[4015.94 → 4020.94] Give teachers strength and wisdom to teach in different ways.
[4020.94 → 4024.94] We are also concerned for the many folks who are not working now.
[4024.94 → 4029.94] We pray that this may soon end and that our economy can get back to a level of normalcy,
[4029.94 → 4038.94] so that those with desperate financial needs can get their financial life back in order.
[4038.94 → 4040.94] Looking to our Council as we are about to begin a new season,
[4040.94 → 4047.94] we ask on behalf of Council members for your powerful presence in decision-making in these uncharted times,
[4047.94 → 4055.94] especially as Council considers the best way and time for us to gradually begin meeting together in person.
[4055.94 → 4059.94] We pray for Pastor Jason True, Christy and family.
[4059.94 → 4061.94] Give them a safe and relaxing time.
[4061.94 → 4067.94] We energize Jason for the task of leading us in these unusual times.
[4070.94 → 4077.94] But we live in a broken world, and we have concerns about the health and well-being of several that are close to us.
[4077.94 → 4083.94] We continue to pray for Andre, for continued progress in strengthening and healing.
[4083.94 → 4087.94] We especially pray for Andre's mobility.
[4087.94 → 4089.94] Touch him.
[4089.94 → 4091.94] Heal him.
[4091.94 → 4097.94] We ask this even to the point of asking you to heal what doctors cannot.
[4097.94 → 4107.94] We learned this week that Mel's sister, Coby, who lives in Red Deer, Alberta, had a serious stroke and is unresponsive.
[4107.94 → 4115.94] We've heard from the doctors that just recently that the news is not good for her prognosis.
[4115.94 → 4119.94] Her husband, Clarence, and two sons are in attendance.
[4119.94 → 4121.94] We pray for comfort.
[4121.94 → 4127.94] We are thankful for the knowledge that she is your child.
[4127.94 → 4133.94] Give them a sense of your comfort as they continue the process of decision-making in the next few days.
[4133.94 → 4137.94] We pray for those suffering from cancer and its treatment.
[4137.94 → 4141.94] Please uphold and strengthen and heal those undergoing treatment.
[4141.94 → 4149.94] We remember Tim and Kathy, both of whom are tired as a result of the effects of chemotherapy.
[4149.94 → 4151.94] We think of Joan as well.
[4151.94 → 4157.94] And now we've heard Kim, who has had a recent reappearance of her cancer.
[4157.94 → 4163.94] And we pray for guidance as decision-making and treatment for this recent reappearance.
[4163.94 → 4169.94] Be with she and George as they face the coming days.
[4169.94 → 4171.94] We pray for our elderly members.
[4171.94 → 4184.94] We think of Cor, Get, Carl, Hank, Jeanette, Grace, Julian, George, and Ada.
[4184.94 → 4196.94] Give them not only safety from disease, but uphold them as they experience months of isolation from family and friends with little prospect of immediate change.
[4196.94 → 4208.94] We pray for Don that his eyesight in one eye may be completely restored after multiple surgeries, including the recent one he had this week to repair a retina.
[4208.94 → 4212.94] We ask that he can once again see clearly through that eye.
[4212.94 → 4218.94] And we pray for a quick resolution of the trauma he's been experiencing for many months.
[4218.94 → 4228.94] We continue to ask that you comfort Sandy and her family as they continue to adjust to the absence of Bill in their lives.
[4228.94 → 4234.94] The news these days is dominated by forest fires in Mention in California in the San Francisco area.
[4234.94 → 4240.94] We pray now for cooling rains and weather conditions to ease fires and assist efforts to extinguish them.
[4240.94 → 4250.94] We pray for the safety of the many forest fires firefighters who are risking their lives to protect people and property.
[4250.94 → 4259.94] We pray for the protection of those whose very lives as well as property are at risk.
[4259.94 → 4267.94] The pandemic situation dominates the news, but we continue to pray for peace and harmony in many areas of the world that do not experience that now.
[4267.94 → 4285.94] Conflicts and disruption in Lebanon, especially after the disastrous explosion in Beirut, in Syria, Belarus because of political unrest, Yemen because of outright war, are just the ones that immediately come to mind.
[4285.94 → 4291.94] It is always the poor and the needy who have no direct involvement in the conflict that suffer most.
[4291.94 → 4299.94] We pray for resolution of armed conflicts, your protection to Christians and Christian missionaries in affected areas,
[4299.94 → 4308.94] and your grace even to those who have a distorted understanding of who you are and your plan of salvation through Jesus.
[4308.94 → 4313.94] Finally, Lord God, inflame our hearts with your love.
[4313.94 → 4318.94] Lord God, please lead us to seek and ensure your standards of justice for all people.
[4318.94 → 4323.94] Forgive us for our ignorant pasts and our unloving behaviours.
[4323.94 → 4327.94] Teach us your ways of honouring and serving our neighbours.
[4327.94 → 4331.94] Lord God, please preserve the goodness and beauty of this land.
[4331.94 → 4335.94] Please look with mercy on those whose hearts seek to love.
[4335.94 → 4340.94] Please heal us and protect us from the onslaught of this pandemic.
[4340.94 → 4343.94] Give us wisdom and care as we move forward.
[4343.94 → 4350.94] Lord, allow us to thrive again in brotherhood in your powerful name and of Jesus, your son.
[4350.94 → 4351.94] Amen.
[4351.94 → 4352.94] Amen.
[4352.94 → 4353.94] Amen.
[4353.94 → 4368.94] Now, lift your hearts and receive God's parting blessing.
[4368.94 → 4372.72] the peace of God be in your heart
[4372.72 → 4376.30] the grace of God be in your words
[4376.30 → 4378.90] the love of God be in your hands
[4378.90 → 4381.92] the joy of God be in your soul
[4381.92 → 4383.62] and the blessing of God Almighty
[4383.62 → 4385.04] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[4385.04 → 4388.04] rest upon you now and always
[4388.04 → 4389.06] Amen
[4398.94 → 4410.18] Father, we love you
[4410.18 → 4415.68] we worship and adore you
[4415.68 → 4422.90] glorify your name in all the earth
[4422.90 → 4430.38] glorify your name
[4430.38 → 4435.34] glorify your name
[4435.34 → 4443.60] glorify your name in all the earth
[4443.60 → 4450.30] Jesus, we love you
[4450.30 → 4455.68] we worship and adore you
[4455.68 → 4462.78] glorify your name in all the earth
[4462.78 → 4469.78] glorify your name
[4469.78 → 4473.78] glorify your name
[4473.78 → 4478.80] glorify your name in all the earth
[4478.80 → 4482.34] glorify your name in all the earth
[4482.34 → 4485.26] glorify your name in all the earth
[4485.26 → 4487.22] glorify your name in all the earth
[4487.22 → 4487.38] glorify your name in all the earth
[4487.38 → 4490.76] glorify your name in all the earth
[4490.76 → 4491.86] glorify your name in all the earth
[4491.86 → 4492.98] glorify your name in all the earth
[4492.98 → 4497.38] glorify your name in all the earth
[4497.38 → 4504.38] Your name is all in your.
[4504.38 → 4509.38] Glorify your name.
[4509.38 → 4514.38] Glorify your name.
[4514.38 → 4524.38] Glorify your name in all the earth.
[4524.38 → 4534.38] Glorify your name in all the earth.
[4554.38 → 4570.38] Glorify your name.
[4570.38 → 4571.38] Amen.
