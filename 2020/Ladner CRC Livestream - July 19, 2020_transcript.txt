[264.86 --> 266.86]  Amen.
[266.86 --> 295.06]  Well, good morning.
[295.06 --> 301.06]  And welcome, everyone, to this Sunday service at Land of Christian Reformed Church.
[301.06 --> 307.06]  Of course, I wish I could look out and see a bunch of smiling faces in the pews.
[307.06 --> 308.06]  Present company accepted.
[308.06 --> 309.06]  There are a few of us.
[309.06 --> 310.06]  Yes, Gary's smiling big.
[310.06 --> 316.06]  But yeah, that's not our reality today, so I do trust that there's more of you tuning
[316.06 --> 317.06]  in online.
[317.06 --> 322.06]  And even more so, I take comfort in knowing that we have a God that is beyond space and
[322.06 --> 324.06]  even beyond time.
[324.06 --> 330.06]  And he will be among us and bless us no matter where or when we are.
[330.06 --> 360.06] 
[360.06 --> 363.06]  He is to be feared above all gods.
[363.06 --> 393.06] 
[393.06 --> 396.06]  And we will tremble before him all the earth.
[396.06 --> 399.06]  Let's spend some time with our praise team as they lead us in the next three songs.
[399.06 --> 400.06]  Let's sing.
[400.06 --> 401.06]  Let's sing.
[401.06 --> 402.06]  Let's sing.
[402.06 --> 403.06] orswreck 2
[403.06 --> 406.06]  x
[406.06 --> 426.58]  Sing to the Lord, sing his praise, all your peoples.
[426.58 --> 433.58]  New be your song, as new honors you pay.
[433.58 --> 439.94]  Sing of his majesty, praise him forever.
[441.36 --> 448.20]  Show his salvation from day to day.
[449.80 --> 455.78]  Tell of his wondrous works, tell of his glory.
[455.78 --> 463.50]  Tell through the nations his name is revered.
[464.08 --> 469.74]  Praise and exalt him, for he is almighty.
[471.36 --> 478.44]  God over all, let the glory be feared.
[478.44 --> 501.76]  Give unto God most high glory and honor.
[501.76 --> 509.12]  Come with your offerings and humbly draw near.
[509.82 --> 515.76]  Worship the Lord in all beauty and splendor.
[517.22 --> 523.76]  Tremble before him with godly fear.
[523.76 --> 534.08]  Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[535.34 --> 541.42]  Karen Lafferty wrote this song one night after attending a Bible study on Matthew 6, verse 33.
[541.42 --> 548.28]  In 1971 at Calvary Chapel, Costa Mesa, California.
[548.28 --> 558.26]  Struggling with financial difficulties after recently starting a full-time music ministry, she returned home that night with new encouragement.
[558.26 --> 561.88]  Others appreciated its beauty and simplicity.
[561.88 --> 571.04]  And the song soon gained popularity, eventually providing the support that permitted her to continue and to develop her ministry.
[571.04 --> 576.28]  Jesus says in Matthew 6, do not worry.
[577.70 --> 585.70]  Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear.
[586.36 --> 591.24]  Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes?
[591.24 --> 595.20]  So do not worry, saying, what shall we eat?
[596.20 --> 597.68]  Or what shall we drink?
[598.74 --> 600.22]  Or what shall we wear?
[601.32 --> 607.56]  But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
[608.56 --> 613.62]  Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[621.24 --> 651.22]  For tomorrow will be given to you as well.
[651.24 --> 653.24]  Alleluia.
[653.24 --> 654.24]  Alleluia.
[654.24 --> 655.24]  Alleluia.
[655.24 --> 661.58]  Ask and it shall be given unto you.
[661.58 --> 667.78]  Seek and you shall find.
[667.78 --> 674.20]  Lock and the door shall be opened unto you.
[674.20 --> 677.24]  Alleluia.
[677.24 --> 680.24]  Alleluia.
[680.24 --> 701.50]  We do not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.
[701.50 --> 704.46]  Alleluia.
[704.46 --> 707.24]  Alleluia.
[707.24 --> 712.24]  Alleluia.
[712.24 --> 713.24]  Alleluia.
[713.24 --> 714.24]  Alleluia.
[714.24 --> 715.24]  Alleluia.
[715.24 --> 716.24]  Alleluia.
[716.24 --> 717.24]  Alleluia.
[717.24 --> 718.24]  Alleluia.
[718.24 --> 719.24]  Alleluia.
[719.56 --> 721.24]  Alleluia.
[721.24 --> 723.24]  Alleluia.
[723.24 --> 726.24]  Alleluia.
[726.24 --> 729.74]  Alleluia.
[729.74 --> 731.24]  Alleluia.
[731.24 --> 732.76]  Alleluia.
[732.80 --> 733.84]  Alleluia.
[733.84 --> 734.84]  Amen.
[763.84 --> 769.30]  You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.
[770.50 --> 777.84]  Jesus knew that when he ascended into heaven, the world would need the Spirit of God with them, and so he sent the Holy Spirit.
[778.80 --> 782.98]  The Holy Spirit indwells us when we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior.
[784.18 --> 789.30]  May you, Holy Spirit, always be in our souls to form Jesus Christ within us.
[793.84 --> 794.84]  Amen.
[806.12 --> 816.88]  Holy Spirit, living breath of God, breathe new life into my willing soul.
[816.88 --> 829.88]  Bring the presence of the risen Lord to renew my heart and make me whole.
[829.88 --> 835.88]  Cause your word to come alive in me.
[837.02 --> 841.88]  Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[843.64 --> 847.88]  Give me passion for your purity.
[849.32 --> 853.88]  Holy Spirit, bring new life in me.
[853.88 --> 863.34]  Holy Spirit, come abide within.
[863.76 --> 868.88]  May your joy be seen in all I do.
[870.88 --> 876.10]  Love me now to cover every sin.
[876.52 --> 880.48]  Get each thought of hand, deep, and attitude.
[880.48 --> 889.48]  Kindness to the greatest and the least.
[890.48 --> 895.76]  Gentleness that sows the path of peace.
[896.26 --> 901.58]  Turn my striving into works of grace.
[902.04 --> 906.76]  Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[906.76 --> 922.76]  Holy Spirit, from creation's birth, giving life to all that God has made.
[923.76 --> 928.76]  Show your power once again on earth.
[928.76 --> 935.76]  Cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[935.76 --> 941.76]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
[941.76 --> 947.76]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[947.76 --> 960.76]  That in unity the face of Christ may be clear for all the world to see.
[960.76 --> 961.76]  Amen.
[961.76 --> 962.12]  Amen.
[970.76 --> 978.54]  We cannot come before God unless we are first honest with ourselves about who we are, about
[978.54 --> 983.50]  the mistakes we make, and about how well or poorly we care for others.
[983.50 --> 987.50]  In this spirit, let's offer our prayers to God.
[987.50 --> 990.50]  Please join me in prayer.
[990.50 --> 995.50]  Almighty God, we confess how hard it is to be your people.
[995.50 --> 1000.50]  You have called us to be the church, to continue the mission of Jesus Christ to our lonely and
[1000.50 --> 1002.50]  confused world.
[1002.50 --> 1009.50]  Yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active, isolated than involved, callous than
[1009.50 --> 1015.50]  compassionate, obstinate than obedient, legalistic than loving.
[1015.50 --> 1020.50]  Gracious Lord, have mercy upon us and forgive us our sins.
[1020.50 --> 1025.50]  Remove the obstacles preventing us from being your representatives to a broken world.
[1025.50 --> 1030.50]  Awaken our hearts to the promised gift of your indwelling spirit.
[1030.50 --> 1033.50]  This we pray in Jesus' powerful name.
[1033.50 --> 1034.50]  Amen.
[1036.50 --> 1041.50]  While we are called to confess our sins, we don't need to dwell on them because God has
[1041.50 --> 1047.50]  promised us forgiveness, which we can be reminded of in these words based on 1 Timothy chapter
[1047.50 --> 1048.50]  1.
[1048.50 --> 1051.50]  Here are words that you may trust.
[1051.50 --> 1054.50]  Words that merit full acceptance.
[1054.50 --> 1057.50]  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[1057.50 --> 1066.50]  To all who confess their sins and resolve to lead a new life, he says, your sins are forgiven.
[1066.50 --> 1069.50]  He also says, follow me.
[1069.50 --> 1078.50]  Now to the one who rules all worlds, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever
[1078.50 --> 1079.50]  and ever.
[1079.50 --> 1083.50]  Let's sing, Create in me a clean heart.
[1083.50 --> 1092.50]  This song, Create in me a clean heart, was a favorite of Bob Bixma.
[1092.50 --> 1098.50]  As he mentioned it to me several times as we were making music together.
[1098.50 --> 1103.50]  Bob was so very helpful with many ministries of the church.
[1103.50 --> 1106.50]  I sure miss him and I'm sure we all miss him.
[1106.50 --> 1110.50]  But this song reminds me always of him.
[1110.50 --> 1111.50]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1111.50 --> 1115.50]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1115.50 --> 1116.50]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1116.50 --> 1128.50]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1128.50 --> 1132.50]  Renew a right spirit within me.
[1134.50 --> 1142.08]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1143.30 --> 1148.50]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1150.88 --> 1157.98]  Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord.
[1157.98 --> 1164.66]  And take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[1165.62 --> 1172.88]  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.
[1174.60 --> 1178.98]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1178.98 --> 1188.92]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1188.92 --> 1195.28]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1195.92 --> 1203.92]  Create in me a clean heart, O God.
[1203.92 --> 1210.92]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1210.92 --> 1218.92]  Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord.
[1218.92 --> 1225.92]  And take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[1225.92 --> 1234.60]  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.
[1234.60 --> 1240.60]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1240.60 --> 1247.60]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1247.60 --> 1248.60]  Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord.
[1248.60 --> 1249.60]  And, Lord, let me pray.
[1249.60 --> 1250.60]  And, Lord, let me pray.
[1250.60 --> 1251.60]  And, Lord, let me pray.
[1251.60 --> 1252.60]  And, Lord, let me pray.
[1252.60 --> 1253.60]  Thank you.
[1253.60 --> 1254.60]  Thank you.
[1254.60 --> 1256.60]  Thank you.
[1256.60 --> 1257.60]  Thank you.
[1257.60 --> 1258.60]  Thank you.
[1258.60 --> 1259.60]  Thank you.
[1259.60 --> 1260.60]  Thank you.
[1260.60 --> 1261.60]  Thank you.
[1261.60 --> 1265.60]  And, sure, we all miss Bob tremendously.
[1265.60 --> 1267.60]  And that was a great reminder of him.
[1267.60 --> 1270.60]  So, thanks again, Mel.
[1270.60 --> 1275.60]  As you may know, Pastor Jason and his family are enjoying a well-earned vacation.
[1275.60 --> 1281.60]  So, it's my privilege this morning to formally welcome our special guest, Pastor Gary Rosema, to the service.
[1281.60 --> 1283.60]  Gary is very familiar to most of us.
[1283.60 --> 1290.60]  But, if you are unaware, Gary leads the Seafarers Ministry in Vancouver and locally here at Delta Port in our backyard.
[1290.60 --> 1292.60]  So, welcome, Gary.
[1292.60 --> 1294.60]  May God bless you as you lead us in exploring his word.
[1294.60 --> 1295.60]  Thank you, Jake.
[1295.60 --> 1309.60]  And, thank you all for allowing me the opportunity to share God's word.
[1309.60 --> 1316.60]  It's good to be with you again this morning and to have this opportunity to share.
[1316.60 --> 1324.60]  So, we wanted to bring a few, just a little bit of an update on what's happening in the port with the Seafarers Ministry.
[1324.60 --> 1327.60]  It was an exciting day, exciting week.
[1327.60 --> 1335.60]  And then, yesterday, the day as we opened, reopened the Seafarers Center downtown for the first time in over four months.
[1335.60 --> 1342.60]  So, that was fun and exciting and sort of, we hope, a harbinger of things to come.
[1342.60 --> 1344.60]  We hope, a lot of things are opening slowly.
[1344.60 --> 1350.60]  And, we have to wait until, it depends on the ship, what their permission they're allowing.
[1350.60 --> 1351.60]  But, some of them are.
[1351.60 --> 1355.60]  So, we're looking forward to slowly over time in welcoming some.
[1355.60 --> 1359.60]  And, of course, we're taking the necessary protocols and all that.
[1359.60 --> 1362.60]  Today, it will be reopening here at Delta Port Banks.
[1362.60 --> 1364.60]  So, that's an exciting time.
[1364.60 --> 1366.60]  So, keep that ministry in your prayers.
[1366.60 --> 1372.60]  Ships continue to go through our, pass through our port very regularly.
[1372.60 --> 1374.60]  Things haven't really changed much there at all.
[1374.60 --> 1381.60]  So, we keep as busy as ever visiting ships and continuing to minister to them.
[1381.60 --> 1384.60]  So, thanks for your prayers for that.
[1384.60 --> 1389.60]  I would invite you to turn in your Bibles, if you have them, or look on the screen.
[1389.60 --> 1394.60]  I believe it will be on the screen as well, to 2 Kings chapter 2.
[1394.60 --> 1396.60]  2 Kings chapter 2.
[1396.60 --> 1400.60]  We'll be reading verses 1 through 14 this morning.
[1400.60 --> 1403.60]  And then, next week, I'll be carrying on.
[1403.60 --> 1409.60]  I'll be reading this part again and carrying on a little bit and continuing with this same basic text.
[1409.60 --> 1413.60]  Before we do that, let's bow in a word of prayer.
[1414.60 --> 1424.60]  Father in heaven, these are your words, your prophetic word for your people.
[1424.60 --> 1434.60]  And as you spoke through the prophets Elijah and Elisha many centuries ago,
[1434.60 --> 1444.60]  continue to speak through their words, through your word, through them, and through your, all of your prophetic word.
[1444.60 --> 1447.60]  And may it speak to us today.
[1447.60 --> 1450.60]  We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1450.60 --> 1452.60]  2 Kings chapter 2.
[1452.60 --> 1454.60]  2 Kings chapter 2.
[1454.60 --> 1457.60]  A familiar story, I'm sure, to many of us.
[1457.60 --> 1464.60]  When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind,
[1464.60 --> 1468.60]  Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
[1468.60 --> 1470.60]  Elijah said to Elisha,
[1470.60 --> 1471.60]  Stay here.
[1471.60 --> 1474.60]  The Lord has sent me to Bethel.
[1476.60 --> 1478.60]  But Elisha said,
[1478.60 --> 1482.60]  As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.
[1482.60 --> 1484.60]  So they went down to Bethel.
[1484.60 --> 1489.60]  The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked,
[1489.60 --> 1492.60]  Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today?
[1492.60 --> 1495.60]  Yes, I know, Elisha replied.
[1495.60 --> 1496.60]  So be quiet.
[1496.60 --> 1500.60]  Then Elijah said to him,
[1500.60 --> 1502.60]  Stay here, Elisha.
[1502.60 --> 1503.60]  The Lord has sent me to Jericho.
[1503.60 --> 1504.60]  And he replied,
[1504.60 --> 1508.60]  As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.
[1508.60 --> 1510.60]  So they went to Jericho.
[1510.60 --> 1514.60]  The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him,
[1514.60 --> 1517.60]  Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?
[1517.60 --> 1520.60]  Yes, I know, he replied.
[1520.60 --> 1521.60]  So be quiet.
[1521.60 --> 1524.60]  Then Elijah said to him,
[1524.60 --> 1525.60]  Stay here.
[1525.60 --> 1527.60]  The Lord has sent me to the Jordan.
[1527.60 --> 1528.60]  And he replied,
[1528.60 --> 1532.60]  As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.
[1532.60 --> 1535.60]  So the two of them walked on.
[1535.60 --> 1538.60]  Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance,
[1538.60 --> 1542.60]  facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
[1542.60 --> 1547.60]  Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it.
[1547.60 --> 1550.60]  The water divided to the right and to the left,
[1550.60 --> 1554.60]  and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
[1554.60 --> 1558.60]  When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha,
[1558.60 --> 1563.60]  Tell me what can I do for you before I am taken from you?
[1563.60 --> 1569.60]  Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit, Elisha replied.
[1569.60 --> 1572.60]  You have asked a difficult thing, Elijah said.
[1572.60 --> 1577.60]  Yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours.
[1577.60 --> 1579.60]  Otherwise, it will not.
[1579.60 --> 1583.60]  As they were walking along and talking together,
[1583.60 --> 1590.60]  suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them.
[1590.60 --> 1592.60]  And Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
[1592.60 --> 1594.60]  Elisha saw it and cried out,
[1594.60 --> 1597.60]  My father,
[1597.60 --> 1598.60]  Wow.
[1598.60 --> 1603.60]  Am I on again?
[1603.60 --> 1604.60]  Okay.
[1604.60 --> 1608.60]  My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel.
[1608.60 --> 1611.60]  And Elisha saw him no more.
[1611.60 --> 1614.60]  Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two.
[1614.60 --> 1616.60]  I'm wondering if that was planned, Don.
[1616.60 --> 1618.60]  Was that planned? Okay.
[1618.60 --> 1621.60]  Elisha then picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him,
[1621.60 --> 1624.60]  and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
[1624.60 --> 1629.60]  He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it.
[1629.60 --> 1632.60]  Where now is the Lord, the God of Elijah?
[1632.60 --> 1633.60]  He asked.
[1633.60 --> 1637.60]  When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left.
[1637.60 --> 1640.60]  And he crossed over.
[1643.60 --> 1646.60]  I remember very well,
[1646.60 --> 1649.60]  six and a half years ago,
[1649.60 --> 1652.60]  the day my father passed away.
[1652.60 --> 1654.60]  We were in the hospital.
[1654.60 --> 1656.60]  He was in intensive care.
[1656.60 --> 1658.60]  He was having heart issues.
[1658.60 --> 1662.60]  And by this time, he was already had pneumonia as well.
[1662.60 --> 1666.60]  And it was clear he was going to pass very soon.
[1666.60 --> 1668.60]  But I still remember the final day.
[1668.60 --> 1672.60]  We were in the intensive care room all alone.
[1672.60 --> 1675.60]  Just him, I mean, and no other patients.
[1675.60 --> 1677.60]  It was darkened.
[1677.60 --> 1680.60]  There were a few of us at this particular time.
[1680.60 --> 1684.60]  The door was open, so occasionally a nurse would pass by.
[1684.60 --> 1686.60]  But otherwise, it was very quiet.
[1686.60 --> 1688.60]  At one point,
[1688.60 --> 1694.60]  my dad was looking towards the foot of his bed, beyond it.
[1694.60 --> 1696.60]  And he kept looking.
[1696.60 --> 1699.60]  And then he started pointing.
[1699.60 --> 1701.60]  What is it, Dad?
[1701.60 --> 1703.60]  And we pulled off his respirator.
[1703.60 --> 1704.60]  What is it?
[1704.60 --> 1707.60]  And he said, he was still aware.
[1707.60 --> 1708.60]  He said,
[1708.60 --> 1712.60]  Who are all those people dancing over there?
[1716.60 --> 1718.60]  And we looked, of course, and didn't see anything.
[1718.60 --> 1723.60]  And it was just one of those eerie moments of,
[1723.60 --> 1725.60]  What is he seeing?
[1725.60 --> 1728.60]  Now, was he hallucinating?
[1728.60 --> 1729.60]  I don't know.
[1729.60 --> 1731.60]  I can't prove it either way.
[1731.60 --> 1735.60]  But we always had this sense that he was beginning,
[1735.60 --> 1740.60]  beginning to see, glimpse a bit into the beyond.
[1740.60 --> 1743.60]  Dad was a godly man.
[1743.60 --> 1746.60]  He was longing.
[1746.60 --> 1748.60]  He lived for his Lord all his life.
[1748.60 --> 1751.60]  And he was longing to be with his Lord again.
[1751.60 --> 1755.60]  Was he seeing something more at that point?
[1756.60 --> 1757.60]  Well, in our text today,
[1757.60 --> 1762.60]  this is Elijah's final day on earth.
[1763.60 --> 1766.60]  It's his swan call.
[1766.60 --> 1768.60]  And everyone knows it.
[1768.60 --> 1770.60]  At least in the prophetic community.
[1770.60 --> 1772.60]  Do you know he's leaving?
[1772.60 --> 1773.60]  Yeah, I know it.
[1773.60 --> 1774.60]  Shut up.
[1774.60 --> 1775.60]  Would you?
[1775.60 --> 1777.60]  And they keep going on.
[1777.60 --> 1778.60]  And there's all these reminders.
[1778.60 --> 1779.60]  Everyone is aware.
[1779.60 --> 1782.60]  This is Elijah's, even Elijah himself.
[1782.60 --> 1785.60]  This is his final day on earth.
[1787.60 --> 1789.60]  But the question is,
[1789.60 --> 1791.60]  What will this mean?
[1792.60 --> 1795.60]  Elijah, the great prophet of the Lord.
[1795.60 --> 1798.60]  He is the premier prophet of this time.
[1798.60 --> 1803.60]  He's the one who brings the word of the Lord and demonstrates the power of God.
[1803.60 --> 1806.60]  And now Elijah is leaving.
[1806.60 --> 1812.60]  What is this going to mean for Elisha?
[1813.60 --> 1816.60]  For the prophetic community?
[1817.60 --> 1819.60]  For Israel?
[1819.60 --> 1824.60]  So they begin their journey.
[1824.60 --> 1825.60]  And they go.
[1825.60 --> 1827.60]  And if you could put the map up.
[1828.60 --> 1830.60]  Hopefully it's clear enough.
[1830.60 --> 1832.60]  You can zoom in or something.
[1832.60 --> 1833.60]  There's a map there.
[1833.60 --> 1836.60]  And it's, anyway, hopefully you can see it enough.
[1836.60 --> 1840.60]  Right in the center there, near the center, just above, a little ways above Jerusalem.
[1840.60 --> 1844.60]  There is Bethel and then there's Gilgal.
[1844.60 --> 1846.60]  And the journey starts north of Jerusalem.
[1846.60 --> 1852.60]  It goes from Gilgal down to Bethel, then over to Jericho.
[1852.60 --> 1857.60]  And then from Jericho they go to the Jordan and cross over the Jordan.
[1857.60 --> 1860.60]  Now there's a bit of a question mark, if you can see it on your maps.
[1860.60 --> 1862.60]  I'm not sure what you're seeing on your screen.
[1862.60 --> 1864.60]  But there's a question mark behind Gilgal.
[1864.60 --> 1867.60]  And that's partly because we don't know exactly where Gilgal was.
[1867.60 --> 1869.60]  There's still debate over that.
[1869.60 --> 1875.60]  Because in Joshua 4 there's a Gilgal where they have the ceremony.
[1875.60 --> 1877.60]  They circumcise all the men.
[1877.60 --> 1882.60]  And they sort of reinstitute the covenant with Yahweh there.
[1882.60 --> 1886.60]  But that's right between the Jordan and Jericho.
[1886.60 --> 1888.60]  But this apparently was another.
[1888.60 --> 1893.60]  And most scholars feel it's at this place or somewhere near there north of Gilgal, of Bethel.
[1893.60 --> 1897.60]  Because it says they went down from the hill country down to Bethel.
[1897.60 --> 1901.60]  And then they go down to Jericho and then they cross the Jordan.
[1901.60 --> 1903.60]  Why these three cities?
[1903.60 --> 1904.60]  We don't know exactly.
[1904.60 --> 1909.60]  Though they all are cities that represent communities of prophets that were there.
[1909.60 --> 1912.60]  So probably something connected with that.
[1912.60 --> 1922.60]  But the point is that they're retracing the steps essentially of Joshua.
[1922.60 --> 1928.60]  Coming into the land and now exiting the land of Israel.
[1928.60 --> 1934.60]  Paul House, one of the commentators, writes these words.
[1934.60 --> 1944.60]  Quote, the text stresses the continuity of God's message and messengers in Israel's history.
[1944.60 --> 1949.60]  And places Elijah on a par with Moses.
[1949.60 --> 1961.60]  The reverse tracing of Joshua's itinerary also serves as a reminder that every foot of the promised land belongs to God.
[1961.60 --> 1965.60]  And is under the authority of God's word.
[1965.60 --> 1968.60]  End quote.
[1968.60 --> 1970.60]  So they take this journey.
[1970.60 --> 1978.60]  And we're told that the journey is on the way so that right already in verse one we're told.
[1978.60 --> 1984.60]  Elijah is to be taken up into heaven.
[1984.60 --> 1987.60]  Taken up into heaven.
[1987.60 --> 1993.60]  And then later in verse 11 we're told he went up into heaven.
[1993.60 --> 1998.60]  In fact this text is often referred to as the ascension of Elijah.
[1998.60 --> 2002.60]  Now that probably doesn't sound like strange language to us.
[2002.60 --> 2009.60]  Because we're used to thinking about heaven being up there and the dead go up.
[2009.60 --> 2014.60]  And then they, when people talk about it right, even you hear it at memorials and funeral services and things like that.
[2014.60 --> 2016.60]  Oh they're looking down on us from up there.
[2016.60 --> 2019.60]  So we're used to thinking that way.
[2019.60 --> 2023.60]  But that's not the Old Testament understanding.
[2023.60 --> 2025.60]  The Hebrew scriptures.
[2025.60 --> 2028.60]  They didn't think of people going up to heaven.
[2028.60 --> 2037.60]  When people died in the Old Testament, the understanding was, and in much of the ancient Near East, you go down.
[2037.60 --> 2040.60]  You go down into Sheol.
[2040.60 --> 2043.60]  The abode of the dead.
[2043.60 --> 2044.60]  The abyss.
[2044.60 --> 2052.60]  Well it's more like just this sleepy, murky, kind of dreamy place where the dead reside.
[2052.60 --> 2055.60]  That's where people go.
[2055.60 --> 2060.60]  This is the only reference to someone being taken up.
[2060.60 --> 2062.60]  Taken up.
[2062.60 --> 2076.60]  So for example, in 1 Samuel 28, you recall Saul at the battle of Mount Gilboa and he's facing these huge forces and he's terrified.
[2076.60 --> 2082.60]  So he goes and he summons the medium of Endor.
[2082.60 --> 2086.60]  Call up the spirit of Samuel.
[2086.60 --> 2094.60]  And when she calls him up, she says, I see like someone coming up out of the earth.
[2094.60 --> 2096.60]  I see him coming up out of the earth.
[2096.60 --> 2106.60]  And when Samuel addresses Saul, King Saul, he says, why have you disturbed me by calling me up?
[2106.60 --> 2116.60]  And even when, for example, Abraham says, gathered to his people or David slept with his fathers, it's the same idea.
[2116.60 --> 2118.60]  You go down.
[2118.60 --> 2119.60]  You don't go up.
[2119.60 --> 2120.60]  You don't go up.
[2120.60 --> 2133.60]  And yet, throughout the Old Testament, there are these hints, little hints, that there's something more.
[2133.60 --> 2145.60]  But Enoch, Genesis 5, Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him.
[2145.60 --> 2148.60]  It doesn't say he was taken up, but he took him.
[2148.60 --> 2154.60]  And there's mystery surrounding the person of Enoch.
[2154.60 --> 2161.60]  Job 19, I know that my Redeemer lives and in the end I will see him.
[2161.60 --> 2169.60]  Or even in the Psalms, there is this hint that even though the dead go down, they don't praise the Lord, we're told in Psalm 115.
[2169.60 --> 2175.60]  But, Psalm 23, I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[2175.60 --> 2185.60]  And so here, again, we have another of those, I think, really strong hints that there's something else.
[2185.60 --> 2190.60]  There's another hope, a greater hope for God's people.
[2190.60 --> 2197.60]  But the key point here, frankly, is Elijah didn't die.
[2197.60 --> 2204.60]  And that's the legend that is spread and goes on and on throughout Israel's history.
[2204.60 --> 2207.60]  Elijah never died.
[2207.60 --> 2214.60]  And because of that, he is, in a sense, almost seen to surpass Moses.
[2214.60 --> 2222.60]  Moses, there's mystery around him because he died, but God buried him.
[2222.60 --> 2224.60]  No one knows where his remains were.
[2224.60 --> 2227.60]  And so there is that sort of aura about Moses.
[2227.60 --> 2231.60]  But Elijah, in particular, there's a difference.
[2231.60 --> 2233.60]  He's literally taken up.
[2233.60 --> 2247.60]  And because of that, great legends developed around the person of Elijah the prophet, particularly about a return.
[2247.60 --> 2253.60]  Malachi, you'll recall, says he'll return.
[2253.60 --> 2254.60]  He's going to return.
[2254.60 --> 2255.60]  He's going to return.
[2255.60 --> 2262.60]  Elijah's coming back on the, before the great and terrible day, dreadful day of the Lord.
[2262.60 --> 2270.60]  He will return almost as this, this forerunner, this one who is set to announce what's coming.
[2270.60 --> 2275.60]  Do you remember?
[2275.60 --> 2276.60]  Do you remember?
[2276.60 --> 2279.60]  And so there's John the Baptist, of course.
[2279.60 --> 2285.60]  We recognize him as the fulfillment of that promise of Elijah the prophet.
[2285.60 --> 2298.60]  In Revelation 11, one of the two witnesses is clearly a picture of an Elijah type of prophet coming back.
[2298.60 --> 2303.60]  But particularly, I'm thinking of Matthew 27.
[2303.60 --> 2308.60]  Matthew 27, do you remember that text at the end of Matthew 27 when Jesus is on the cross?
[2308.60 --> 2314.60]  And at the near the end of his life, very near the end, he cries out and he says,
[2314.60 --> 2318.60]  Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani.
[2318.60 --> 2322.60]  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[2322.60 --> 2326.60]  Which is a quote from Psalm 22, of course.
[2326.60 --> 2329.60]  But what did the people mistake it for?
[2329.60 --> 2332.60]  He's calling for Elijah.
[2332.60 --> 2337.60]  Eli, Eli, Eliahu, Eliahu.
[2337.60 --> 2344.60]  The names are very similar because Eliahu means my God is Yahweh.
[2344.60 --> 2349.60]  My God, my God.
[2349.60 --> 2351.60]  And it's not for no reason.
[2351.60 --> 2353.60]  It's not just a misunderstanding.
[2353.60 --> 2357.60]  There's a reason why they heard Eliahu or Elijah.
[2357.60 --> 2369.60]  Because they were anticipating there was this promise or this understanding that Elijah would come back to save his righteous people.
[2369.60 --> 2374.60]  And so they expected that of Jesus.
[2374.60 --> 2378.60]  Or were waiting, taunting him with that hope.
[2378.60 --> 2382.60]  And Jews are still waiting for Jesus, for, sorry, for Elijah.
[2382.60 --> 2390.60]  Every year at Passover, at the Seder, the Passover meal, there's an extra chair for Elijah.
[2390.60 --> 2397.60]  And at the end of a Seder, they opened the door for a brief time to allow Elijah to come back.
[2397.60 --> 2399.60]  Still waiting for him to come.
[2399.60 --> 2410.60]  Now, I find it particularly intriguing though, that it's, who is it who meets Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration?
[2410.60 --> 2415.60]  It's Moses and it's Elijah.
[2415.60 --> 2420.60]  Now, clearly they represent the law and the prophets.
[2420.60 --> 2433.60]  But it's also intriguing that these are the two in the Old Testament around whom this mystery about what happened to them still exists.
[2433.60 --> 2436.60]  Moses, we don't know where he was buried.
[2436.60 --> 2437.60]  God buried him.
[2437.60 --> 2439.60]  Elijah, taken up.
[2439.60 --> 2447.60]  And, also striking, is the fact that they're the two who die outside of the land.
[2447.60 --> 2450.60]  Moses never got to go in.
[2450.60 --> 2456.60]  Elijah leaves the land to cross over the Jordan, to be outside on the other side.
[2456.60 --> 2466.60]  And it's as if, almost at the Mount of Transfiguration, Moses finally gets there.
[2466.60 --> 2477.60]  He finally gets into the Promised Land and Elijah comes back.
[2477.60 --> 2488.60]  So, before they're crossing the Jordan, or as they cross the Jordan, Elijah says to Elisha,
[2488.60 --> 2490.60]  what can I do for you?
[2490.60 --> 2493.60]  What would you like me to do for you before I'm taken?
[2493.60 --> 2496.60]  And Elisha makes that request.
[2496.60 --> 2501.60]  I want that double portion of your spirit.
[2501.60 --> 2504.60]  Now, don't misunderstand this.
[2504.60 --> 2508.60]  He's not saying, I want to be even better than you are.
[2508.60 --> 2509.60]  I want to be even more powerful.
[2509.60 --> 2512.60]  I want more of the spirit than even you have.
[2512.60 --> 2513.60]  That's not the point here.
[2513.60 --> 2521.60]  What Elisha is calling for, asking for, is the inheritance of the firstborn son.
[2521.60 --> 2524.60]  Deuteronomy 21, verse 17.
[2524.60 --> 2531.60]  The firstborn son is to be given the double portion of an inheritance.
[2531.60 --> 2535.60]  Twice as much as the other, any of the other children.
[2535.60 --> 2537.60]  Because he's the firstborn.
[2537.60 --> 2544.60]  He's the one who's called upon to carry on the work and the name of his father.
[2544.60 --> 2546.60]  So he's given this double portion.
[2546.60 --> 2551.60]  Our oldest son reminds us regularly of this commandment.
[2551.60 --> 2554.60]  He thinks it's one we should still follow from the Old Testament.
[2554.60 --> 2560.60]  But be that as it may.
[2560.60 --> 2562.60]  This is his request.
[2562.60 --> 2565.60]  And Elijah says, wow.
[2565.60 --> 2569.60]  You've asked a hard thing.
[2569.60 --> 2573.60]  What's so hard about that?
[2573.60 --> 2575.60]  Why is it hard?
[2575.60 --> 2578.60]  Well, most feel that it's hard.
[2578.60 --> 2592.60]  And I tend to agree that because, it's hard because that anointing of the spirit, that double portion, is really not something that Elijah gives.
[2592.60 --> 2597.60]  Only God can give that.
[2597.60 --> 2606.60]  Only God can really grant his anointing to his prophets.
[2606.60 --> 2613.60]  And so he says, Elisha, if you're going to do this, you need to have your eyes opened.
[2613.60 --> 2615.60]  You need to see.
[2615.60 --> 2620.60]  You need to really see what's happening.
[2620.60 --> 2625.60]  You need to get a prophet's vision.
[2626.60 --> 2632.60]  To see the deeper realities of what's going on.
[2633.60 --> 2636.60]  And only God can grant that.
[2638.60 --> 2642.60]  Well, of course, the good news is, Elisha does see.
[2642.60 --> 2645.60]  He is granted that vision.
[2645.60 --> 2650.60]  He sees Elijah ascending in the storm.
[2650.60 --> 2657.60]  And by the way, just to note here, Elijah does not hop on the chariot and ride up in the chariot as is so often depicted.
[2658.60 --> 2663.60]  The chariots merely come and the horses come between the two of them.
[2663.60 --> 2671.60]  Elijah goes up in the storm or the tempest or the whirlwind, however it's translated.
[2671.60 --> 2679.60]  And in a sense, when the chariots come between the two of them, they're now in separate realms.
[2680.60 --> 2684.60]  And Elijah is being taken up into that other realm, the beyond.
[2684.60 --> 2688.60]  But Elisha gets at least a glimpse.
[2688.60 --> 2690.60]  He gets the vision.
[2690.60 --> 2695.60]  He's allowed to see what's really going on.
[2695.60 --> 2701.60]  And then Elijah is ushered up to heaven in the whirlwind.
[2701.60 --> 2708.60]  By the way, that term, the whirlwind or windstorm or tempest, is also used in the book of Job.
[2708.60 --> 2718.60]  At the end of Job, you'll recall, the Lord answered Job out of the tempest, out of the whirlwind, out of the storm.
[2718.60 --> 2722.60]  This is God's way of often speaking.
[2722.60 --> 2733.60]  And what's important to notice here is, Baal, the god of one of the big gods of that area, Baal was the storm god.
[2733.60 --> 2737.60]  But who's really the god of the storm?
[2737.60 --> 2742.60]  Yahweh, the Lord.
[2742.60 --> 2752.60]  And so Elisha cries out, my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen.
[2752.60 --> 2753.60]  Why does he make that cry?
[2753.60 --> 2768.60]  Well, in a sense, he recognizes that Elijah, as God's prophet, is the true defender of Israel or the Lord working through him.
[2768.60 --> 2773.60]  He is the mighty defender of true Israel.
[2773.60 --> 2783.60]  And these chariots, these horsemen, they are Israel's real security.
[2783.60 --> 2788.60]  Not those of the human king.
[2788.60 --> 2808.60]  You'll recall, I'm sure, when thinking of this text, 2 Kings chapter 6, when Elisha later on is in the city of Dothan and the enemy armies come around and his servant goes out and he sees the armies and he says, we're doomed.
[2808.60 --> 2811.60]  And he goes to Elisha and says, what are we going to do?
[2811.60 --> 2812.60]  Look at all these armies.
[2812.60 --> 2813.60]  And what does Elisha do?
[2813.60 --> 2814.60]  He says, he prays.
[2814.60 --> 2820.60]  He says, Lord, Lord, open his eyes so that he can see what's really going on.
[2820.60 --> 2823.60]  And then on the mountains all around, what does he see?
[2823.60 --> 2827.60]  Chariots and horses of fire.
[2827.60 --> 2829.60]  God's army.
[2829.60 --> 2840.60]  Or in chapter 13, the same cry comes on the king as he comes to Elisha on his sickbed, nearly dead.
[2840.60 --> 2843.60]  And he cries out the same cry.
[2843.60 --> 2848.60]  My father, my father, the horsemen, the chariots and the horsemen of Israel.
[2848.60 --> 2850.60]  I think of Psalm 68.
[2850.60 --> 2855.60]  The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.
[2855.60 --> 2861.60]  So chariots and fire and whirlwind.
[2861.60 --> 2862.60]  God's appearance.
[2862.60 --> 2870.60]  But I think it's important to note that at times these same symbols, chariots, fire and horsemen,
[2870.60 --> 2876.60]  also represent God's judgment.
[2876.60 --> 2879.60]  Isaiah 66, verse 15.
[2879.60 --> 2885.60]  See, the Lord is coming with fire and his chariots are like a whirlwind.
[2885.60 --> 2890.60]  He will bring down his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.
[2890.60 --> 2892.60]  Or Jeremiah 4, verse 13.
[2892.60 --> 2895.60]  Look, he advances like the clouds.
[2895.60 --> 2898.60]  His chariots come like a whirlwind.
[2898.60 --> 2900.60]  His horses are swifter than eagles.
[2900.60 --> 2902.60]  Woe to us.
[2902.60 --> 2904.60]  We are ruined.
[2904.60 --> 2909.60]  And so there is this strong sense also that judgment can be part of this.
[2909.60 --> 2912.60]  Now that's not the primary theme here.
[2912.60 --> 2915.60]  But it, I think, is a back story.
[2915.60 --> 2926.60]  Because Elijah and eventually Elisha too, are also proclaiming God's judgment for rebellion.
[2926.60 --> 2937.60]  The point, though, is the real battle in kings, throughout kings, is not the petty battles going on between nations.
[2937.60 --> 2945.60]  The real battle is between faithful worship to Yahweh, to the Lord,
[2945.60 --> 2954.60]  versus the ever appealing allure of Baal and the gods.
[2954.60 --> 2957.60]  That's the real battle.
[2957.60 --> 2967.60]  And so what's essential for Elisha and what is essential for any true prophet is to be able to see.
[2967.60 --> 2971.60]  To get the vision.
[2971.60 --> 2979.60]  After all, the old name for a prophet was a seer.
[2979.60 --> 2982.60]  And that's why I think too, Elisha is pressed.
[2982.60 --> 2984.60]  We'll look at this a bit more next week.
[2984.60 --> 2986.60]  But he's pressed throughout.
[2986.60 --> 2991.60]  As they're on their journey, you recall, he's pressed to, just stay here.
[2991.60 --> 2993.60]  Why don't you just stay here, Elijah says to him.
[2993.60 --> 2995.60]  And he says, no, no, no.
[2995.60 --> 3000.60]  The question is, will he press on to really see the vision?
[3000.60 --> 3005.60]  Because there's more than meets the eye.
[3005.60 --> 3008.60]  That's just the reality.
[3008.60 --> 3012.60]  And the prophet is one who must see that.
[3012.60 --> 3016.60]  And he calls all God's people to see that.
[3016.60 --> 3021.60]  To recognize it.
[3021.60 --> 3026.60]  There's more going on than meets the eye.
[3026.60 --> 3030.60]  You know, humans are this mix.
[3030.60 --> 3032.60]  It's sort of a mystery.
[3032.60 --> 3042.60]  We're a mix of physical, instinctual, and on the other hand, sort of spiritual, almost angelic.
[3042.60 --> 3045.60]  We are this mix.
[3045.60 --> 3050.60]  Now, I'm not promoting some kind of Gnostic dualism.
[3050.60 --> 3053.60]  Like, the physical is bad and the spiritual is good.
[3053.60 --> 3054.60]  That's not the point here.
[3054.60 --> 3057.60]  That's Plato or something like that.
[3057.60 --> 3062.60]  But we do need to get these in balance.
[3062.60 --> 3073.60]  And keep our eyes open to the other realities, particularly the Lord and his vision.
[3073.60 --> 3078.60]  I'm reading a, I've been reading an interesting book lately by Michael Heiser.
[3078.60 --> 3081.60]  He's an Old Testament Hebrew scholar.
[3081.60 --> 3084.60]  And he's written a book called The Unseen Realm.
[3084.60 --> 3095.60]  And in it, he explains how, and he goes throughout, especially the Old Testament, some into the New Testament, but especially through Israel's scriptures.
[3095.60 --> 3109.60]  He goes throughout all of that and looks at the different, the various hints, the various ways in which the beyond is very real in the Old Testament.
[3109.60 --> 3122.60]  And he explains how, in the West particularly, because we've lost that sense of what's more, the bigger reality, the spiritual realities,
[3122.60 --> 3130.60]  it's harder for us to understand so much of scripture because we just can't see it.
[3130.60 --> 3137.60]  In the West, we think more and more, this is all there is.
[3137.60 --> 3142.60]  Materialism, not acquisition of goods only, but the material is all there is.
[3142.60 --> 3148.60]  Or Carl Sagan, quote, the cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be, close quote.
[3148.60 --> 3151.60]  That's the dominant worldview.
[3151.60 --> 3166.60]  You know, if I would talk about this text and explain it to my friends in Borneo, Malaysia, or in Papua New Guinea,
[3166.60 --> 3170.60]  they would have no problem grasping this.
[3170.60 --> 3172.60]  None at all.
[3172.60 --> 3181.60]  Because for them, that reality is still so alive, so real.
[3181.60 --> 3187.60]  And this is where Westerners and even Western, we as Western Christians struggle.
[3187.60 --> 3197.60]  We confess to believe, but we seldom live it.
[3197.60 --> 3202.60]  But I do think at times we get hints, don't we?
[3202.60 --> 3206.60]  We get hints that there's something more.
[3206.60 --> 3211.60]  In certain times of our lives, we know it.
[3211.60 --> 3214.60]  At least most people do.
[3214.60 --> 3222.60]  I think of friends who have had loved ones, particularly I think spouses, who have passed away.
[3222.60 --> 3235.60]  And for them, they express it that that veil between life and death is thin, razor thin.
[3235.60 --> 3241.60]  We have hints that there's something more.
[3241.60 --> 3245.60]  And you know, the scriptures all through, and particularly Jesus, call us to this.
[3245.60 --> 3249.60]  We sang the song, Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[3249.60 --> 3255.60]  And part of Jesus' call in that Matthew 6 passage is,
[3256.60 --> 3259.60]  Don't store up treasures on earth.
[3259.60 --> 3264.60]  Moth and rust and thieves.
[3264.60 --> 3265.60]  No.
[3265.60 --> 3269.60]  Lay up your treasures in heaven.
[3269.60 --> 3278.60]  Or I think of the words, and we have a slide for this, I believe, in Colossians chapter 3.
[3278.60 --> 3281.60]  Paul's words, Colossians chapter 3.
[3281.60 --> 3291.60]  If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[3291.60 --> 3299.60]  Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
[3299.60 --> 3306.60]  For you have died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[3306.60 --> 3315.60]  When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
[3315.60 --> 3319.60]  I'd encourage you to think about that text.
[3319.60 --> 3321.60]  What does he mean?
[3321.60 --> 3323.60]  What is he saying in Colossians 3?
[3327.60 --> 3329.60]  I'm reminded of the story of Stephen.
[3329.60 --> 3333.60]  Stephen, one of the early martyrs in Acts chapter 7.
[3333.60 --> 3335.60]  You remember the story of Stephen?
[3335.60 --> 3343.60]  And he gives this long speech, and it's really an indictment of the audience who's listening.
[3343.60 --> 3345.60]  And they know it.
[3345.60 --> 3347.60]  And they react in rage.
[3347.60 --> 3349.60]  And they're about to stone him.
[3349.60 --> 3351.60]  And he says, I see the...
[3351.60 --> 3356.60]  He sees the risen Lord standing at the right hand of the Father.
[3356.60 --> 3358.60]  And he says, I see the Son of Man.
[3358.60 --> 3360.60]  I see him.
[3360.60 --> 3362.60]  And they can't take it.
[3362.60 --> 3364.60]  They can't see it.
[3364.60 --> 3371.60]  Or I think particularly of the prophet Simeon in Luke chapter 2.
[3371.60 --> 3376.60]  Do you remember that story when Jesus is still an infant, and he's just being brought to the temple.
[3376.60 --> 3379.60]  And Simeon sees him, and he knows.
[3379.60 --> 3380.60]  He knows.
[3380.60 --> 3388.60]  And he grabs the baby, and he says, wow, this is what I've been waiting for all these years.
[3388.60 --> 3391.60]  All these years.
[3391.60 --> 3396.60]  And he says, now, Lord, let me go.
[3396.60 --> 3397.60]  Dismiss me.
[3397.60 --> 3404.60]  For my eyes have seen your salvation.
[3404.60 --> 3405.60]  Think about it.
[3405.60 --> 3410.60]  Everyone else just saw a baby.
[3410.60 --> 3419.60]  Simeon saw the Lord's salvation, Yeshua.
[3419.60 --> 3422.60]  Can you see it?
[3422.60 --> 3423.60]  Can you see it?
[3423.60 --> 3426.60]  The prophetic vision?
[3426.60 --> 3431.60]  There are so many competing visions out there.
[3431.60 --> 3434.60]  They're loud.
[3434.60 --> 3440.60]  They're often bright and stimulating.
[3440.60 --> 3450.60]  But will we, can we, see and hear the prophetic vision?
[3450.60 --> 3461.60]  Especially as it's so much brighter and clearer in the prophetic ministry of Jesus.
[3461.60 --> 3464.60]  Can you see it?
[3464.60 --> 3467.60]  Can you see him?
[3467.60 --> 3470.60]  Let's pray.
[3470.60 --> 3477.60]  Heavenly Father, open our eyes.
[3477.60 --> 3486.60]  Help us to see that vision.
[3486.60 --> 3493.60]  We pray in the name of Jesus, our Lord, the one we truly long to see.
[3493.60 --> 3495.60]  Amen.
[3495.60 --> 3506.60]  We're going to sing now a song, a hymn, Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken.
[3506.60 --> 3509.60]  We're going to sing the four verses.
[3509.60 --> 3511.60]  Particularly, they're all good.
[3511.60 --> 3512.60]  The words are good.
[3512.60 --> 3515.60]  John Newton was good at writing songs.
[3515.60 --> 3517.60]  Particularly verse four.
[3517.60 --> 3521.60]  Savior, I'm reading the old, probably older English.
[3521.60 --> 3527.60]  Savior, if of Zion's city, I through grace a member am.
[3527.60 --> 3530.60]  Let the world deride or pity.
[3530.60 --> 3533.60]  I will glory in thy name.
[3533.60 --> 3540.60]  Fading is the worldlings pleasure, all his boasted pomp and show.
[3540.60 --> 3548.60]  Solid joys and lasting treasure, none but Zion's children know.
[3548.60 --> 3549.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3549.60 --> 3552.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3552.60 --> 3553.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3553.60 --> 3555.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3555.60 --> 3558.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3558.60 --> 3573.60]  Glorious things of Thee are spoken, Zion city of our God.
[3573.60 --> 3582.60]  He whose word cannot be broken, Forthly for his own abode.
[3582.60 --> 3592.60]  On the rock of ages founded, What can shake thy sure repose?
[3592.60 --> 3602.60]  With salvation whose walls surround it, Thou be smiled at all thy foes.
[3603.60 --> 3621.60]  Round each habitation hovering, See the cloud and fire appear, For a glory and a covering, Showing that the Lord is near.
[3621.60 --> 3644.60]  The earth is near, Us deriving from their banner, Life by night and shade by day, Safe they feed upon the manna, Which God gives them on their way.
[3644.60 --> 3645.60]  Amen.
[3645.60 --> 3646.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3646.60 --> 3647.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3647.60 --> 3648.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3648.60 --> 3649.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3649.60 --> 3650.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3650.60 --> 3651.60]  Let's sing this song.
[3651.60 --> 3665.74]  Savior, saints of Zion City,
[3665.74 --> 3670.84]  I through grace remember hell.
[3671.22 --> 3675.52]  Let the world deride your pity,
[3676.16 --> 3680.80]  I will glory in your name.
[3680.80 --> 3686.24]  Fading o'er the world's best pleasures,
[3686.62 --> 3691.32]  All its boasted pomp and show,
[3691.90 --> 3696.64]  Solid joys and lasting treasures,
[3697.16 --> 3701.62]  None but Zion's children know.
[3710.80 --> 3722.32]  The cause we are supporting through our offerings this week is our denominational ministry shares.
[3722.32 --> 3727.14]  And that supports a variety of very worthwhile programs run by the Christian Reformed Church,
[3727.14 --> 3732.84]  Such as Resonate Global Missions, World Renew, Indigenous Ministries and of course many more.
[3732.84 --> 3736.64]  There are a variety of ways to continue giving to causes such as this,
[3736.64 --> 3742.46]  And our details are in your connections newsletter.
[3742.46 --> 3744.46]  It's time for our prayer, our community prayer,
[3744.46 --> 3750.64]  But before we join in prayer, there is a significant matter of concern that we want to pray about this morning,
[3750.64 --> 3753.08]  That I was informed of just before the service.
[3753.08 --> 3758.40]  If you've been following the news, you may have heard of the tragedy in the Columbia ice fields,
[3758.40 --> 3760.64]  Where a tour bus rolled over,
[3760.64 --> 3764.60]  27 people aboard and three people tragically lost their lives.
[3764.60 --> 3769.96]  As I mentioned, I found out just before the service that Andre Grotendorst,
[3769.96 --> 3773.44]  The son of Rick and Yvonne Grotendorst,
[3773.44 --> 3775.64]  And brother of Brian Grotendorst,
[3775.64 --> 3777.24]  Was on that bus with two friends.
[3777.24 --> 3781.48]  So Andre is in critical condition in the hospital.
[3781.48 --> 3782.88]  We're not sure which hospital,
[3782.88 --> 3786.60]  Because people were flown to a variety of hospitals after that accident.
[3786.60 --> 3790.64]  His friends as well are in hospital in maybe less critical condition,
[3790.64 --> 3791.92]  But still serious.
[3791.92 --> 3795.12]  So we definitely want to remember Grotendorst's family,
[3795.12 --> 3797.52]  And all those affected by this tragedy in our prayers.
[3799.96 --> 3801.96]  So let's come together in prayer, please.
[3805.64 --> 3809.48]  Father, we thank you for the time we could spend together this morning.
[3809.48 --> 3815.32]  Taking time to praise you and worship you is a privilege that many in the world don't have.
[3816.44 --> 3819.88]  We thank you that you call us to confess our sins before you,
[3820.52 --> 3823.96]  And that coupled with that comes a promise to forgive them,
[3823.96 --> 3828.28]  And accept us as your children, made perfect through your sacrifice.
[3828.28 --> 3832.28]  We pray that as we are washed clean through your promise,
[3832.28 --> 3836.68]  Your spirit will work in our hearts to transform us into your image,
[3836.68 --> 3843.80]  Filled with your power, your wisdom, your strength, and an eagerness to advance your kingdom.
[3843.80 --> 3853.96]  Lane Smith's article in our Connections newsletter reminded us of your guiding hand on this congregation over the years, stretching back to 1950.
[3853.96 --> 3861.40]  We pray that the reminders of your faithfulness, coupled with the courage and faith of those first congregants here in Ladner,
[3861.40 --> 3866.04]  Can be an inspiration to us today as we face our own challenges in these times.
[3867.48 --> 3874.52]  And we thank you also again for Pastor Gary and him being able to join us this morning and bring the message from Kings.
[3874.52 --> 3885.16]  And we do pray again that you open our eyes and that we can see the spiritual reality of your presence in our lives and through that see the greater vision.
[3887.16 --> 3891.80]  And Lord, we also have petitions to bring before you knowing that you have promised to hear them.
[3892.84 --> 3896.28]  We wish to pray for your healing spirit to be amongst us.
[3896.28 --> 3903.88]  For those with ongoing health struggles, we pray for healing and strength and comfort and patience as they go through difficult times.
[3904.76 --> 3908.60]  Lord, you know each and every one of us better than we know ourselves even.
[3909.16 --> 3911.00]  And you know what we struggle with.
[3911.88 --> 3912.76]  We pray for healing.
[3913.56 --> 3914.68]  We pray for strength.
[3915.40 --> 3919.16]  We pray for support from the congregation for all those that struggle.
[3919.96 --> 3925.08]  In particular, Lord, please be near those battling cancer and the side effects of cancer treatments.
[3925.08 --> 3927.80]  Please be near Tim and Kathy and Joan.
[3928.28 --> 3933.48]  Walk with them and comfort them during the times when we ourselves can't be physically near them.
[3934.68 --> 3939.08]  And Lord, this morning we want to also bring before you the Grote-endorsed family.
[3941.08 --> 3945.60]  The tragic accident that Andre was involved in.
[3945.60 --> 3962.24]  We just pray for your spirit to be in that family, to comfort them through a difficult time as they try to get news of Andre and try to deal with this in a time where it's difficult even to visit in hospitals.
