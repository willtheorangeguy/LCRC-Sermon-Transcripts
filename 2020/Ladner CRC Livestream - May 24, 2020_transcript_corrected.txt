[0.00 → 9.42] He explained, Jesus, please don't let this go in vain.
[11.12 → 14.00] You're all I have, all that remains.
[14.78 → 27.00] So here I am, what's left of me, where glory meets my suffering.
[27.00 → 39.00] I'm alive, even though a part of me has died.
[39.66 → 46.00] You take my heart and breathe it back to life.
[46.00 → 53.34] I fall into your arms open wide.
[53.34 → 57.44] I'm a hurt, I'm a healer.
[57.66 → 61.34] I breathe.
[64.44 → 69.34] Sometimes I feel it's all that I can do.
[71.34 → 76.34] Pain so deep that I can hardly move.
[76.34 → 84.02] Just keep my eyes completely fixed on you.
[85.34 → 89.18] Lord, take hold and pull me through.
[89.44 → 100.44] So here I am, what's left of me, where glory meets my life.
[106.34 → 109.34] Amen.
[109.34 → 111.60] Amen.
[112.34 → 115.60] Amen.
[115.84 → 118.40] Amen.

[133.24 → 163.22] Thank you.
[163.24 → 193.22] Thank you.
[193.24 → 196.24] For still our ancient...
[223.24 → 228.14] Take my tears
[228.14 → 229.24] Find your glory
[229.80 → 231.38] Even here
[231.38 → 232.24] In the hurt
[232.24 → 235.12] And the healer
[235.12 → 238.62] Jesus come and break my fear
[238.62 → 240.54] Wake my heart
[240.54 → 242.52] Take my tears
[242.52 → 244.52] Find your glory

[250.44 → 254.44] Come now
[254.44 → 262.44] Come now
[262.44 → 266.44] Come now

[274.44 → 276.44] Come now
[276.44 → 277.44] Every blessing
[277.44 → 279.44] To my heart
[279.44 → 280.44] To sing
[280.44 → 281.44] Thy praise
[281.44 → 283.44] Streams of mercy
[283.44 → 285.44] Never ceasing
[285.44 → 287.44] Call for songs
[287.44 → 288.44] All for songs
[288.44 → 290.44] Of loudest praise
[290.44 → 292.44] Teach me some
[292.44 → 294.44] Melody of sonnet
[294.44 → 298.44] Sung by flaming tongues above
[298.44 → 300.44] Praise the mountain
[300.44 → 302.44] Fix upon
[302.44 → 307.44] Mount of thy redeemed love
[307.44 → 318.44] Here I raise my Ebenezer
[318.44 → 322.44] Here by thy great help I've come
[322.44 → 324.44] And I hope
[324.44 → 327.44] And I hope by thy good pleasure
[327.44 → 331.44] Safely to arrive at home
[331.44 → 336.44] Cause Jesus saw me when a stranger
[336.44 → 340.44] Wandering from the fall of God
[340.44 → 344.44] He to rescue me from danger
[344.44 → 349.44] Interposes precious blood
[374.44 → 376.44] Bit of creation
[376.44 → 393.44] That dog
[393.44 → 395.44] Disgusting
[395.44 → 397.44] The love
[397.44 → 402.44] To shell
[402.44 → 403.44] To
[403.44 → 410.44] Lord, I fear it, prone to leave the God alone.
[410.92 → 418.44] Heal my heart, Lord, take and seal it, heal it for thy courts above.
[418.44 → 425.20] Take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above.
[425.20 → 431.74] Take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above.
[431.74 → 441.50] Heal my heart, Lord, I fear it, prone to leave the God alone.
[441.50 → 451.46] Heal my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above.
[461.74 → 475.74] Heal my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it, seal it for thy courts above.
[475.74 → 485.38] Weak and wounded sinner, lost and led to die.
[486.82 → 490.88] Raise your head for love is passing by.
[490.88 → 495.00] Come to Jesus.
[495.00 → 498.36] Come to Jesus.
[498.36 → 503.22] Come to Jesus.
[503.22 → 505.74] And live.
[505.74 → 523.38] Sing to Jesus.
[523.38 → 526.74] Sing to Jesus.
[526.74 → 531.28] Sing to Jesus.
[531.28 → 536.28] And live.
[536.28 → 542.36] Like a newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl.
[542.36 → 547.96] And remember when you walk, sometimes we fall.
[547.96 → 553.54] Fall on Jesus.
[553.96 → 557.46] Fall on Jesus.
[557.54 → 559.50] Fall on Jesus.
[560.42 → 562.40] And live.
[562.40 → 574.62] Sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[574.62 → 592.92] So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus.
[592.92 → 615.16] And then, oh, and when the love spills over and music fills the night, when you can't contain your joy inside, then dance for Jesus.
[615.16 → 626.00] Dance for Jesus, dance for Jesus, and live.
[630.88 → 644.28] With your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye, and go in peace and laugh on glory's side.
[645.16 → 660.58] And fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, and live.
[660.58 → 680.00] Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, and live.
[680.00 → 709.00] Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[709.00 → 712.86] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[713.74 → 717.66] Worship His holy name.
[719.50 → 722.64] Sing like never before.
[723.64 → 730.92] Oh my soul, I worship your holy name.
[730.92 → 739.36] The sun comes up.
[739.36 → 742.84] It's new day dawning.
[742.84 → 748.44] It's time to sing your song again.
[748.44 → 756.22] Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me.
[756.22 → 764.60] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[764.60 → 764.62] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[764.62 → 765.62] Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[765.62 → 771.62] Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[771.62 → 780.40] Oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[780.40 → 785.06] Sing like never before.
[785.06 → 786.06] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[786.06 → 792.06] Oh my soul, worship your holy name.
[792.06 → 793.06] You're rich in love.
[793.06 → 805.56] You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger.
[805.56 → 812.56] Your name is great, and your heart is kind.
[812.56 → 818.56] For all your goodness, I will keep on singing.
[818.56 → 819.56] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to sing.
[819.56 → 825.56] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[825.56 → 826.56] Ten thousand.
[826.56 → 830.56] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to fly in love.
[830.56 → 835.56] wreck the Lord, oh my soul.
[836.58 → 846.56] Oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[847.48 → 852.14] Sing like never before.
[852.14 → 856.56] I worship your holy name.
[857.16 → 858.78] Bless you, Lord.
[873.78 → 875.92] Good morning and welcome to this church.
[875.92 → 879.22] To all of you who are listening in and are going to join.
[879.22 → 882.54] May the Lord bless us this morning then as we worship him.
[883.08 → 886.30] And only in him, in spirit and in truth.
[887.36 → 893.06] The theme of this worship service is or comes from Psalm 46.
[893.54 → 898.68] God is our refuge and our strength and ever-present help in trouble.
[899.68 → 903.08] Now most of us know the hymn, A Mighty Fortress is Our God.
[903.58 → 907.78] Which of course was written and composed by Martin Luther, the German church reformer.
[907.78 → 911.52] And we're going to hear from that.
[913.32 → 917.68] Angela, who is behind the organ, she will give an introductory verse.
[918.18 → 921.74] And on the screen there will be the words of verse 2.
[921.92 → 923.26] You may wonder why verse 2.
[923.92 → 925.48] Verse 1 will come later.
[925.62 → 927.52] So let's listen to Angela and the organ.
[927.68 → 928.12] And enjoy.
[928.34 → 936.80] A Russets XV mountains.
[936.80 → 941.84] So let's listen.
[941.84 → 945.62] What has named you is Jesus.
[945.62 → 946.96] What has named you?
[946.96 → 947.72] Heaven so may be a Such?
[947.72 → 948.92] Heaven so may God be a Japanese son.
[948.92 → 949.88] Oh God, have been a prophet.
[950.60 → 951.16] God, have been a true.
[951.16 → 951.94] Such as We will have been another.
[951.94 → 952.14] Look at your mission so may.
[952.14 → 953.02] And M doth, which of Christians will know today.
[953.02 → 953.68] That's what you want, had and rue please.
[953.92 → 954.00] Hope is a forum.
[954.00 → 955.28] The Holy cm sine,
[955.40 → 957.40] That's what you want, has been a treat.
[957.40 → 958.40] Amen.
[987.40 → 991.06] Now this of course is a hymn.
[991.92 → 994.20] You can imagine we would love to sing here together.
[995.32 → 996.64] We have lots of volume.
[997.42 → 1000.00] And it just is not the way it is right now.
[1000.92 → 1004.78] And I'm reminded of the words, or we are reminded of the words of Psalm 122.
[1004.98 → 1006.12] That was written by David.
[1006.66 → 1007.78] Where David says,
[1011.32 → 1014.36] I rejoiced with those who said to me,
[1014.98 → 1017.30] Let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1017.40 → 1021.36] To praise the name of the Lord.
[1021.94 → 1022.90] To the house of the Lord.
[1023.52 → 1025.24] Or the words of Psalm 84.
[1026.74 → 1029.16] I rather be in your courts than a thousand elsewhere.
[1029.92 → 1036.18] And so we miss coming together here as a community of faith to worship the Lord.
[1036.84 → 1039.54] But that day will come.
[1040.18 → 1040.92] The Lord is faithful.
[1041.74 → 1045.50] And so receive God's blessing as you are in your home.
[1045.50 → 1047.10] And we're worshipping together.
[1047.56 → 1052.74] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[1053.40 → 1055.82] And from the seven spirits who are before him.
[1056.32 → 1061.10] And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead,
[1061.10 → 1064.42] And the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[1065.48 → 1065.90] Amen.
[1066.90 → 1072.06] Let us now together here and in the room where you are, in your house,
[1072.56 → 1075.96] Worship the Lord with singing some hymns of praise.
[1075.96 → 1077.58] Pardon me.
[1078.22 → 1078.94] One more time.
[1078.94 → 1080.70] On next.
[1080.70 → 1110.68] Thank you.
[1110.70 → 1140.68] Thank you.
[1140.70 → 1142.70] Thank you.
[1170.70 → 1172.70] Thank you.
[1200.70 → 1202.70] Thank you.
[1230.70 → 1232.70] Thank you.
[1232.70 → 1234.70] Thank you.
[1262.70 → 1264.70] Thank you.
[1264.70 → 1265.70] Thank you.
[1265.70 → 1266.70] Thank you.
[1266.70 → 1268.70] Thank you.
[1268.70 → 1270.70] Thank you.
[1270.70 → 1272.70] Thank you.
[1300.70 → 1302.70] Thank you.
[1302.70 → 1304.70] Thank you.
[1304.70 → 1306.70] Thank you.
[1306.70 → 1308.70] Thank you.
[1308.70 → 1310.70] Thank you.
[1310.70 → 1312.70] Thank you.
[1312.70 → 1314.70] Thank you.
[1314.70 → 1316.70] Thank you.
[1316.70 → 1318.70] Thank you.
[1318.70 → 1320.70] Thank you.
[1320.70 → 1322.70] Thank you.
[1322.70 → 1324.70] Thank you.
[1324.70 → 1326.70] Thank you.
[1326.70 → 1328.70] Thank you.
[1328.70 → 1330.70] Thank you.
[1330.70 → 1332.70] Thank you.
[1332.70 → 1334.70] Thank you.
[1334.70 → 1336.70] Thank you.
[1336.70 → 1344.76] When darkness seems to light its face
[1344.76 → 1350.26] I rest on His unchanging grace
[1350.26 → 1355.66] In every heart its glory Beale
[1355.66 → 1360.92] I am your old to live in the day
[1360.92 → 1368.08] Christ alone, God and stone
[1368.08 → 1373.94] Weak and strong in Saviour's love
[1373.94 → 1382.22] Through the storm He is Lord, God alone
[1382.22 → 1391.04] And He shall come in trumpet's time
[1391.04 → 1396.78] Only I am in Him, we found
[1396.78 → 1401.52] Just in His righteousness alone
[1401.52 → 1406.76] All blessed is still before the throne
[1406.76 → 1413.92] Christ alone, God and stone
[1413.92 → 1420.12] Weak and strong in Saviour's love
[1420.12 → 1428.84] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[1428.84 → 1436.00] Christ alone, God and stone
[1436.00 → 1441.92] Weak and strong in Saviour's love
[1441.92 → 1451.00] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[1451.00 → 1461.08] Next week Sunday
[1461.08 → 1467.40] We hope and rejoice in the fact that we will be celebrating Pentecost
[1467.40 → 1470.12] The outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1470.12 → 1474.08] Now ten days before Pentecost, that was last Thursday
[1474.08 → 1480.82] We had the ascension of our Lord into heaven
[1480.82 → 1484.22] He is seated at the right hand of our Father now
[1484.22 → 1486.74] He is interceding for us
[1486.74 → 1489.40] And one day He will come again
[1489.40 → 1490.62] As you know from scripture
[1490.62 → 1494.72] To judge the living and the dead
[1494.72 → 1496.20] What a glorious day that will be
[1496.20 → 1497.36] We just sang about that
[1497.36 → 1499.80] And what I want to do this morning
[1499.80 → 1502.24] Instead of our confession and assurance
[1502.24 → 1504.48] I would like to read to you from the first chapter
[1504.48 → 1506.94] Of the book of Acts written by Luke
[1506.94 → 1512.58] About the story of Jesus taken up into heaven
[1512.58 → 1514.72] And I am going to start with verse 3
[1514.72 → 1518.86] After His suffering, that is Jesus' suffering
[1518.86 → 1521.68] He showed Himself to the apostles
[1521.68 → 1525.48] And gave many convincing proofs that He was alive
[1525.48 → 1529.60] He appeared to them over a period of 40 days
[1529.60 → 1532.58] And spoke about the kingdom of God
[1532.58 → 1536.68] On one occasion while He was eating with them
[1536.68 → 1538.10] He gave them this command
[1538.10 → 1541.04] Do not leave Jerusalem
[1541.04 → 1544.40] But wait for the gift my Father promised
[1544.40 → 1546.94] Which you have heard me speak about
[1546.94 → 1549.38] For John baptized with water
[1549.38 → 1554.82] But in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1554.82 → 1557.76] So when they met together
[1557.76 → 1558.58] They asked Him
[1558.58 → 1561.16] Lord, are you at this time
[1561.16 → 1563.56] Going to restore the kingdom of Israel?
[1565.20 → 1566.58] And Jesus said to them
[1566.58 → 1569.94] It is not for you to know the times or dates
[1569.94 → 1572.80] The Father has set by His own authority
[1572.80 → 1576.50] But you will receive power
[1576.50 → 1579.06] When the Holy Spirit comes on you
[1579.06 → 1582.48] And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[1582.48 → 1584.66] And in all Judea
[1584.66 → 1586.08] And Samaria
[1586.08 → 1588.46] And to the ends of the earth
[1588.46 → 1591.00] And what a day that will be
[1591.00 → 1593.88] And the world has changed ever after
[1593.88 → 1595.88] The kingdom of God through His church
[1595.88 → 1597.48] The church of Jesus Christ
[1597.48 → 1600.94] We are going to sing now
[1600.94 → 1604.16] About the amazing love of God in Christ
[1604.16 → 1605.26] Amazing love
[1605.26 → 1611.28] Thank you
[1611.28 → 1612.28] Amen.
[1641.28 → 1642.28] Amen.
[1671.28 → 1672.28] Amen.
[1701.28 → 1702.28] Amen.
[1731.28 → 1733.28] Amen.
[1761.28 → 1768.32] Amazing love, how can it be?
[1768.32 → 1774.24] And you my King will die for me.
[1775.70 → 1782.18] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[1783.84 → 1791.24] It's my joy to honour you in all I do.
[1791.28 → 1795.28] I honour you.
[1801.28 → 1802.68] Morning, Pastor Jason.
[1803.24 → 1807.14] May the Lord bless you as you bring us his words based on Psalm 46.
[1821.28 → 1823.92] And thank you, Ernst, for that nice welcome.
[1825.28 → 1841.56] And so we are in the seventh Sunday of the season of Easter, which is the season when the church rejoices in the resurrection of Jesus and considers what it means that Jesus came to bring life to the world.
[1841.56 → 1847.42] And so this Easter we're in a sermon series in the Psalms called Singing the New Song.
[1848.24 → 1854.58] And today we're going to look at Psalm 46 as a song of rest.
[1854.96 → 1855.92] A song of rest.
[1855.92 → 1864.90] It's a song that teaches us to rest in God who is our refuge and our strength.
[1864.90 → 1873.16] And we might think that as Christians, resting in God would be easy.
[1873.78 → 1877.64] It seems kind of foundational to the Christian life.
[1877.64 → 1886.28] But I think it's probably true for most of us that, you know, spiritually speaking, we are bad at resting.
[1887.06 → 1894.56] You know, our hearts and our minds and our souls are often going a million miles an hour.
[1894.56 → 1898.74] And God understands that about us.
[1899.40 → 1905.14] And the centrepiece of the psalm, and it's a psalm that is one of my favourites, and maybe it's one of your favourites,
[1905.84 → 1910.16] is the centrepiece is this command to be still.
[1911.22 → 1916.88] God says, be still and know that I am God.
[1918.02 → 1921.84] But the reality is that it is very hard to rest.
[1921.84 → 1929.30] And even when we get a chance to rest physically, you know, maybe we take some time off and go on vacation,
[1929.30 → 1933.86] or maybe we've reached retirement, and we have fewer demands on our time.
[1934.32 → 1939.24] But our heart often doesn't cooperate with us.
[1940.22 → 1947.48] And this psalm, I think, does a wonderful job of getting at this problem deep inside each of us.
[1947.48 → 1954.52] And so let's read Psalm 46, and please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1957.94 → 1963.24] God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
[1964.30 → 1969.76] Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
[1970.44 → 1975.26] though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
[1975.26 → 1980.18] There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
[1980.84 → 1983.58] the holy place where the Most High dwells.
[1984.20 → 1985.32] God is within her.
[1986.08 → 1987.20] She will not fall.
[1987.92 → 1990.12] God will help her at the break of day.
[1991.14 → 1992.40] Nations are in uproar.
[1992.54 → 1993.44] Kingdoms fall.
[1994.30 → 1995.84] He lifts his voice.
[1996.50 → 1997.48] The earth melts.
[1998.84 → 2001.14] The Lord Almighty is with us.
[2001.62 → 2003.54] The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[2003.54 → 2006.96] Come and see what the Lord has done.
[2007.56 → 2010.10] The desolations he has brought on the earth.
[2010.62 → 2013.64] He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.
[2014.12 → 2016.70] He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[2017.20 → 2018.74] He burns the shields.
[2019.70 → 2020.58] And says,
[2021.22 → 2023.46] Be still and know that I am God.
[2024.10 → 2026.10] I will be exalted among the nations.
[2026.78 → 2028.82] I will be exalted in the earth.
[2028.82 → 2031.58] The Lord Almighty is with us.
[2032.16 → 2035.28] The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[2035.28 → 2038.14] So this is the word of the Lord.
[2039.50 → 2040.64] Thanks be to God.
[2041.28 → 2042.42] So let's pray together.
[2045.12 → 2049.16] Our Heavenly Father, we need to learn to rest.
[2049.16 → 2052.10] Even though we are in this pandemic.
[2052.10 → 2054.44] When maybe a lot of us are at home.
[2054.64 → 2059.72] And we think things should probably be a bit quieter.
[2059.94 → 2062.30] Even then, Lord, we are anxious in our hearts.
[2063.00 → 2064.92] There is much turmoil.
[2065.54 → 2066.56] There is fighting.
[2067.60 → 2068.56] There is argument.
[2069.06 → 2070.20] There is stress.
[2070.20 → 2074.78] And so, Lord, we are a world that needs rest.
[2075.72 → 2078.16] And, Lord, each one of us, we need to rest.
[2078.28 → 2079.30] We need to trust in you.
[2079.88 → 2083.54] We need to be quiet and be still.
[2083.96 → 2089.04] And so, Lord, right now, even though it's hard to rest worshipping on livestream,
[2089.70 → 2093.92] Lord, we ask that in this time that you would quiet us.
[2094.38 → 2099.54] That we might be able to tune our hearts to hear what you would have to say to us.
[2099.54 → 2102.38] So we pray, Lord, that your spirit would be at work.
[2102.48 → 2103.56] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[2104.08 → 2104.38] Amen.
[2106.54 → 2110.12] And so, earlier in the service already, we sang the famous hymn.
[2110.18 → 2111.74] It's a hymn I love and grew up singing.
[2112.20 → 2114.00] It's called, A Mighty Fortress is Our God.
[2114.66 → 2118.84] It was written by Martin Luther in the year 1527.
[2119.54 → 2124.88] And as Elder Ernst has already pointed out, it's based on the psalm, Psalm 46.
[2125.82 → 2128.76] And it says, A mighty fortress is our God.
[2129.54 → 2131.20] A bulwark never failing.
[2131.96 → 2136.52] Our helper the amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing.
[2137.42 → 2138.36] He is our helper.
[2138.88 → 2140.82] He is this bulwark that will never fail.
[2141.48 → 2146.58] So Martin Luther would say to his friend Melanchthon, when they were in any kind of trouble,
[2146.68 → 2152.60] they would say, Come, let us sing the 46th Psalm, and let the devil do his worst.
[2152.60 → 2162.88] And so my hope for us today is that we would also learn how to sing this psalm in that way,
[2163.02 → 2169.50] that when trouble comes, we could kind of rouse ourselves and say, Let's sing the 46th Psalm.
[2169.50 → 2171.46] Let us rest in God.
[2173.54 → 2178.64] And so what does this psalm teach us about resting in God in the midst of trouble?
[2178.76 → 2182.78] And I think we see three things in this psalm for us this morning.
[2183.16 → 2188.02] The challenge to rest, the confidence that we can have to rest in God,
[2188.02 → 2190.52] and then the cultivation of rest.
[2190.60 → 2193.68] How can we practice rest in our lives?
[2193.76 → 2195.36] And so we'll look at those three things.
[2195.82 → 2197.92] And so first, the challenge of rest.
[2198.84 → 2201.02] And we see this in verse 2.
[2202.02 → 2202.34] It says,
[2202.34 → 2209.12] Therefore we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[2209.12 → 2218.00] You know, and there are two challenges that this verse describes to our being able to find rest in God.
[2218.54 → 2222.76] And the first challenge is that the world is a dangerous place.
[2224.10 → 2228.30] The psalmist is describing a world that is falling apart, literally.
[2229.22 → 2232.32] But also, I think we could say metaphorically as well.
[2232.90 → 2236.70] So he says, it talks about the earth giving way.
[2236.70 → 2239.42] And it's speaking, of course, about an earthquake.
[2240.16 → 2247.26] You know, and when an earthquake strikes, one of the things that happens is the ground becomes soft and crumbles.
[2247.84 → 2252.66] You know, that which was solid, that we stand on, which we build houses on,
[2254.80 → 2257.02] that thing no longer holds us.
[2257.52 → 2257.66] Right?
[2257.78 → 2261.16] Buildings and people begin to sink into the earth.
[2261.16 → 2267.10] So that's physically, but I think the earth gives way metaphorically as well.
[2267.84 → 2275.76] The ground that you are standing on, you know, whether it's a thing or a circumstance in your life that you thought was stable,
[2276.60 → 2280.64] or a person that was a rock to you,
[2281.18 → 2282.60] suddenly they're gone.
[2283.20 → 2289.46] Suddenly that person or that part of your life you thought was so stable is gone.
[2289.46 → 2292.92] And it feels like the earth is just giving way.
[2294.40 → 2298.76] And it says, though the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[2299.56 → 2305.38] You know, in those mountains, there are these immovable, unshakeable fixed points.
[2306.42 → 2310.18] And so here in Ladder, you know, we can see the mountains.
[2310.42 → 2313.06] We look up, and we see the mountains on the North Shore.
[2313.06 → 2318.66] So after my family and I moved here to British Columbia,
[2319.22 → 2325.46] we went back east to visit my home, which is the state of Vermont in the U.S.
[2325.94 → 2332.80] And the name Vermont comes from the French, which means, as you probably know, green mountains.
[2333.42 → 2334.70] So we're known for our mountains.
[2334.70 → 2340.18] But we bring my daughter Ellie there, and she didn't even realize we were in the mountains,
[2340.52 → 2345.12] because to her, these green mountains of Vermont were just like these tiny hills.
[2346.38 → 2350.30] She's used to the mountains here that we have in British Columbia.
[2350.48 → 2351.66] You know, we have real mountains.
[2351.80 → 2355.36] We have these tall, you know, strong, majestic-looking mountains.
[2355.82 → 2358.98] And you can see them from anywhere here in the Lower Mainland.
[2358.98 → 2362.38] And the mountains help us to tell direction.
[2363.04 → 2365.28] So we look up, we see the mountains.
[2366.02 → 2370.08] And for someone like me who is directionally challenged, this is super helpful.
[2370.56 → 2372.16] Someone, when I first moved here, said,
[2372.72 → 2376.14] you always know where north is because you can see the mountains.
[2376.90 → 2380.08] And so you look up, and you say, okay, so that's north.
[2380.38 → 2383.18] And now I know that's east, that's west, and that's south.
[2383.76 → 2385.70] You know, these are fixed points.
[2385.70 → 2391.26] And I can rely on them to orient myself in the world.
[2392.82 → 2397.10] But what if those mountains disappeared?
[2398.04 → 2398.28] Right?
[2398.38 → 2401.62] What if they sank into the heart of the sea?
[2402.70 → 2404.52] So the psalmist here is saying,
[2404.98 → 2410.98] use your imagination and consider the thing in your life where if it was no longer there,
[2411.64 → 2414.26] you would feel disoriented.
[2414.26 → 2417.10] Like your world is turned upside down.
[2417.20 → 2421.32] Like you don't know which way you're facing and which direction to go.
[2422.50 → 2426.96] You know, maybe it's financial trouble where a business fails, or you lose your job.
[2427.04 → 2430.42] Maybe it's a relationship that begins to come apart.
[2431.18 → 2434.34] And all of a sudden, the mountains are falling into the sea.
[2434.34 → 2440.68] So not only is the world, though, a dangerous place and unstable,
[2441.40 → 2447.86] the second challenge to rest that the psalm assumes is that we can't handle it.
[2448.50 → 2448.92] Right?
[2448.96 → 2453.90] In the face of this danger, we are not strong enough to save ourselves.
[2454.28 → 2454.88] Right?
[2454.88 → 2457.00] We can't control the natural environment.
[2457.56 → 2461.28] This pandemic has struck and is completely out of our control.
[2461.94 → 2466.34] We can't control the wars that the psalmist talks about in verse 9.
[2467.20 → 2467.40] Right?
[2467.40 → 2473.60] We can't control when we get sick, when we lose our job, when accidents happen.
[2473.60 → 2478.20] But we live as if we were in control of our lives.
[2478.82 → 2481.88] You know, we go to the dry cleaners.
[2481.96 → 2483.86] We drop off a shirt on Tuesday.
[2484.52 → 2485.76] And the person says,
[2485.88 → 2487.92] So when do you want to pick it up?
[2488.16 → 2489.74] And we say, Thursday.
[2489.74 → 2493.24] That's something simple we do all the time.
[2493.38 → 2493.42] Right?
[2493.52 → 2497.52] We make plans for the future as if everything will be the same.
[2498.08 → 2500.78] And there aren't going to be any hiccups at all.
[2501.46 → 2501.70] Right?
[2501.76 → 2506.04] We think, you know, of course I'm going to be able to go to school next week.
[2506.42 → 2507.80] Or go to my job.
[2508.68 → 2511.90] But Psalm 46 reminds us of what we already know,
[2512.24 → 2514.18] that things actually aren't that way.
[2514.26 → 2517.56] That the world as it is now doingn't work in this way.
[2517.56 → 2521.58] And this is one of the reasons we find it so hard to rest.
[2522.24 → 2529.52] Because we fear that as soon as we kind of step back, and we rest,
[2530.20 → 2532.38] that our world might collapse.
[2533.04 → 2537.04] We think it's up to us to keep things in control.
[2537.26 → 2539.96] And so we got to keep going and going and striving,
[2540.30 → 2542.54] just to hold the chaos at bay.
[2543.70 → 2547.12] And so that's the real challenge to rest that we face.
[2547.56 → 2553.88] So how can we rest when the world is such a dangerous place,
[2554.28 → 2555.88] mountains can fall into the sea,
[2556.50 → 2558.38] the earth can melt,
[2558.68 → 2560.58] and we are not in control?
[2560.78 → 2563.00] How can we rest?
[2564.16 → 2565.54] And the answer is,
[2566.08 → 2570.20] we need someone who actually is in control.
[2570.90 → 2571.32] Right?
[2571.38 → 2574.50] We need someone who actually is strong enough
[2574.50 → 2576.22] for us,
[2576.28 → 2577.24] on our behalf.
[2578.82 → 2583.00] So this psalm not only confronts us with the challenge of rest,
[2583.04 → 2586.74] but it also gives us the confidence that we need to rest.
[2587.06 → 2588.92] And we see that in verse 1.
[2588.92 → 2591.68] So it says,
[2592.08 → 2596.10] God is our refuge and strength and ever-present help in trouble.
[2597.06 → 2597.46] Therefore,
[2598.00 → 2599.32] what does it say?
[2600.12 → 2601.00] It went away,
[2601.16 → 2602.00] but it says,
[2602.50 → 2603.34] we will not fear.
[2603.86 → 2604.00] Okay?
[2604.02 → 2604.82] We will not fear.
[2606.34 → 2608.32] So I was thinking about my daughter,
[2608.48 → 2608.92] Gabby,
[2609.02 → 2610.12] and she's older now.
[2610.18 → 2611.60] She's grown a ton recently.
[2612.42 → 2613.72] But when she was younger,
[2614.14 → 2614.34] right,
[2614.36 → 2615.76] if we were out in a crowd,
[2616.00 → 2616.14] if,
[2616.56 → 2617.14] you know,
[2617.24 → 2619.52] if she began to feel unsafe,
[2620.14 → 2622.88] she would grab onto my leg and hold on,
[2623.00 → 2623.90] kind of behind me.
[2624.08 → 2624.58] Hold on.
[2624.72 → 2626.80] Or she would grab onto my wife's leg.
[2627.20 → 2627.42] You know,
[2627.44 → 2629.22] and maybe you've had kids who do this,
[2629.24 → 2631.12] or you've seen children act like this.
[2631.90 → 2634.98] So she runs to the person who she knows
[2634.98 → 2636.26] can protect her
[2636.26 → 2638.20] and who loves her.
[2638.84 → 2638.96] Right?
[2638.96 → 2643.84] She runs to the person who she knows will be with her
[2643.84 → 2648.54] and who is stronger than the thing that she fears.
[2649.18 → 2651.46] And that's the instinct that we all have
[2651.46 → 2652.36] when we are afraid.
[2652.50 → 2652.60] Right?
[2652.64 → 2653.06] We say,
[2653.42 → 2655.82] where can I find refuge?
[2656.04 → 2657.26] Where can I find safety?
[2657.80 → 2659.78] What is strong enough to protect me?
[2661.04 → 2664.26] And this psalm says that there is one powerful,
[2664.46 → 2665.40] almighty God
[2665.40 → 2668.36] who is our refuge and our strength.
[2668.96 → 2672.44] So God is this cosmic leg
[2672.44 → 2674.22] that we can run to
[2674.22 → 2675.54] and hold onto
[2675.54 → 2679.54] when the world around us feels unsafe
[2679.54 → 2681.64] and where we need protection.
[2682.98 → 2685.70] So God calls us to rest in him
[2685.70 → 2689.82] and he provides two things that we need.
[2690.32 → 2691.76] He gives us his power
[2691.76 → 2693.46] and he gives us his presence.
[2693.46 → 2696.44] So first, his power.
[2697.14 → 2697.96] It says,
[2698.74 → 2701.68] God is our refuge and strength.
[2701.76 → 2702.24] Not that one.
[2702.42 → 2702.64] Sorry.
[2703.10 → 2704.64] It says in the verse we already looked at
[2704.64 → 2706.96] that God is our refuge and strength.
[2708.12 → 2709.90] And the word refuge
[2709.90 → 2713.36] is a picture of shelter.
[2713.36 → 2715.50] So if you are,
[2715.72 → 2716.00] you know,
[2716.04 → 2717.76] you're out in,
[2717.88 → 2718.42] on the town,
[2718.58 → 2720.16] you're outside at a park
[2720.16 → 2723.16] and suddenly you hear the thunder
[2723.16 → 2724.86] crash in the distance
[2724.86 → 2726.36] and the cloud rolls in
[2726.36 → 2727.70] and it's about to rain
[2727.70 → 2728.96] and you don't have your umbrella,
[2729.42 → 2730.14] what do you do?
[2730.76 → 2731.76] You look around
[2731.76 → 2733.26] and maybe you see a building
[2733.26 → 2734.48] with an awning over it.
[2734.58 → 2735.80] So you make a dash
[2735.80 → 2736.46] and you run
[2736.46 → 2738.16] and you get under the awning
[2738.16 → 2741.38] and you're not,
[2741.52 → 2742.74] you can be out of the rain.
[2743.26 → 2743.96] It's a shelter.
[2745.18 → 2746.44] So God says to you,
[2747.02 → 2748.40] I am your refuge.
[2749.08 → 2750.58] I am that thing
[2750.58 → 2752.06] that you can run to
[2752.06 → 2753.24] and hide under
[2753.24 → 2754.76] and be safe.
[2755.32 → 2755.96] So he says,
[2756.22 → 2757.84] when there's trouble,
[2757.94 → 2759.20] don't run away from me.
[2759.68 → 2760.62] Run to me.
[2762.32 → 2763.24] And it says,
[2763.38 → 2764.62] God is our strength.
[2764.74 → 2766.28] And the idea here
[2766.28 → 2768.40] is that God is strong
[2768.40 → 2770.04] on our behalf.
[2771.10 → 2771.90] So, you know,
[2771.92 → 2773.92] think of a mother bear
[2773.92 → 2775.92] protecting her cubs.
[2777.22 → 2778.30] The mama bear
[2778.30 → 2782.06] is the strength of her cubs, right?
[2782.12 → 2784.06] The cubs don't need to be strong.
[2784.48 → 2786.60] They're only baby bears
[2786.60 → 2789.84] because if there is any danger
[2789.84 → 2790.72] that they run into,
[2790.72 → 2792.30] the mother bear
[2792.30 → 2793.58] is going to step in.
[2794.30 → 2795.24] So one time,
[2795.24 → 2796.62] I was hiking in Colorado
[2796.62 → 2798.78] and we were going down the path
[2798.78 → 2799.70] and there,
[2799.82 → 2800.66] right on the side of the path,
[2800.72 → 2801.56] were two baby bears.
[2802.30 → 2803.72] And I've never been more afraid
[2803.72 → 2804.28] in my life
[2804.28 → 2806.36] because I'm not worried
[2806.36 → 2807.56] about the little baby bears.
[2808.14 → 2809.54] I'm worried that the mom
[2809.54 → 2810.82] is right there
[2810.82 → 2812.12] behind a tree or a rock.
[2812.22 → 2813.42] And so my friends and I,
[2813.48 → 2814.88] we just started running
[2814.88 → 2816.14] down the trail.
[2817.32 → 2818.32] It's not the cubs
[2818.32 → 2819.38] you have to be worried about.
[2819.38 → 2820.22] And for us,
[2820.42 → 2822.18] we don't have to be worried
[2822.18 → 2824.78] because God is our strength.
[2825.54 → 2826.10] God says,
[2826.84 → 2828.48] I can fight for you.
[2828.56 → 2829.78] I can protect you.
[2830.50 → 2830.82] Right?
[2830.88 → 2831.82] You don't have to fight
[2831.82 → 2832.60] those battles
[2832.60 → 2834.74] because I will use my strength
[2834.74 → 2836.88] because you are my child
[2836.88 → 2837.74] and I love you.
[2839.64 → 2841.66] But not only do we see here
[2841.66 → 2843.56] that God is powerful enough
[2843.56 → 2845.22] for us to rest in,
[2845.22 → 2847.22] He is also present with us.
[2848.24 → 2848.40] You know,
[2848.48 → 2849.48] verse 1 says,
[2850.00 → 2852.42] He's an ever-present help
[2852.42 → 2853.24] in trouble.
[2854.06 → 2855.24] Then down in verse 7,
[2855.32 → 2855.74] it says,
[2855.90 → 2856.98] The Lord Almighty
[2856.98 → 2858.42] is with us.
[2859.48 → 2860.66] And the big idea
[2860.66 → 2861.34] in this psalm
[2861.34 → 2863.10] is that God is with us.
[2863.68 → 2863.94] Right?
[2864.16 → 2864.78] It says,
[2864.90 → 2866.46] He dwells with us.
[2867.12 → 2868.10] And for the Christian,
[2868.98 → 2870.94] we know that He has sent
[2870.94 → 2872.54] His Spirit to be with us.
[2873.16 → 2874.50] In the Gospel of John,
[2874.50 → 2876.18] Jesus says to His disciples,
[2877.02 → 2878.36] I will ask the Father
[2878.36 → 2879.52] and He will give you
[2879.52 → 2880.56] another advocate
[2880.56 → 2881.82] to help you
[2881.82 → 2883.18] and be with you forever.
[2884.16 → 2885.56] The Spirit of truth.
[2886.44 → 2888.16] For He lives with you
[2888.16 → 2890.68] and will be in you.
[2891.52 → 2892.52] Hey, as Christians,
[2892.80 → 2894.62] we have the Holy Spirit.
[2894.96 → 2896.90] God is with us.
[2897.64 → 2897.84] You know,
[2897.92 → 2899.10] I've heard some theologians
[2899.10 → 2901.06] say that God is closer to you
[2901.06 → 2903.34] than you are to yourself.
[2903.34 → 2905.34] which is one of those things
[2905.34 → 2905.78] that, you know,
[2905.82 → 2907.16] you can lie in bed at night
[2907.16 → 2908.54] thinking about a long time.
[2908.98 → 2910.22] God is closer to you
[2910.22 → 2911.38] than you are to yourself.
[2912.42 → 2913.54] He's not saying, you know,
[2913.58 → 2914.84] you've got to go on this big
[2914.84 → 2916.76] scavenger hunt in the world
[2916.76 → 2917.72] to find Him.
[2918.02 → 2918.90] He is saying,
[2919.30 → 2920.82] I am not far away.
[2920.92 → 2922.08] I am near to you.
[2922.76 → 2924.20] He is present with us.
[2924.20 → 2928.10] So God is our refuge,
[2928.56 → 2929.68] our strength,
[2929.78 → 2931.68] and ever-present help.
[2932.54 → 2932.96] And it says,
[2933.10 → 2933.60] in trouble.
[2934.56 → 2935.66] God is saying, you know,
[2935.86 → 2937.96] especially in those times
[2937.96 → 2939.52] and circumstances
[2939.52 → 2940.92] when you are in trouble,
[2941.72 → 2943.90] that is where I am present.
[2944.58 → 2944.80] Right?
[2944.86 → 2945.64] In those places
[2945.64 → 2947.12] where we fear the most,
[2947.18 → 2948.36] and often for us,
[2948.70 → 2949.30] it's those times
[2949.30 → 2950.90] when we wonder,
[2951.10 → 2952.04] where is God?
[2952.04 → 2953.32] God says,
[2953.70 → 2955.06] I am present to you
[2955.06 → 2956.38] in trouble.
[2957.12 → 2957.70] In trouble.
[2957.96 → 2959.02] That's where I'm with you.
[2960.08 → 2961.96] So we need a God
[2961.96 → 2964.00] who is both
[2964.00 → 2965.32] powerful
[2965.32 → 2967.18] and present.
[2968.28 → 2969.38] And let's think about that
[2969.38 → 2969.76] for a minute.
[2970.22 → 2970.74] Because,
[2971.62 → 2973.02] you know,
[2973.10 → 2974.98] if He is only powerful,
[2975.68 → 2978.40] if He is only almighty God,
[2978.68 → 2980.42] but He's not present,
[2980.42 → 2980.84] you know,
[2980.84 → 2982.70] if He doesn't love us
[2982.70 → 2984.10] and care about us,
[2984.54 → 2985.06] that's not,
[2985.10 → 2986.24] that's not going to do us any good.
[2986.32 → 2986.94] That's not a refuge.
[2987.30 → 2988.60] He could be a powerful God,
[2988.82 → 2991.00] but if He's not present with us,
[2991.12 → 2992.78] that's no help to us at all.
[2993.74 → 2995.22] So my daughter Gabby
[2995.22 → 2996.78] runs and grabs my leg
[2996.78 → 2999.14] because I am here for her.
[2999.70 → 2999.92] Right?
[2999.96 → 3001.02] She doesn't just run and grab
[3001.02 → 3003.22] any leg of any person she sees,
[3003.54 → 3005.20] even if it looks stronger.
[3005.64 → 3006.72] My leg looks pretty strong,
[3006.76 → 3007.28] I'm pretty sure.
[3007.28 → 3009.00] But still,
[3009.24 → 3011.12] she's going to grab onto
[3011.12 → 3012.92] the one who cares for her.
[3013.58 → 3015.06] But on the other hand,
[3015.56 → 3018.56] if God is present
[3018.56 → 3020.54] and He's loving
[3020.54 → 3021.86] and He cares for you,
[3022.50 → 3023.54] but He's not powerful,
[3024.28 → 3025.66] that's not a refuge either.
[3025.92 → 3027.04] He can be with you,
[3027.38 → 3029.48] but He might be in the same boat
[3029.48 → 3030.50] you are in
[3030.50 → 3032.90] and be also at the mercy
[3032.90 → 3034.26] of the surrounding trouble.
[3034.26 → 3036.36] And that's not a refuge.
[3037.02 → 3039.50] But God is both powerful
[3039.50 → 3040.98] and present.
[3041.58 → 3043.54] He is great, and He is good.
[3044.80 → 3044.96] You know,
[3045.06 → 3045.90] and it reminds me
[3045.90 → 3047.12] of that famous dialogue
[3047.12 → 3048.72] in the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe
[3048.72 → 3051.16] that preachers love to talk about,
[3051.58 → 3052.84] but I don't get tired of it.
[3053.74 → 3054.98] It's when the beavers
[3054.98 → 3057.02] are describing to the children,
[3057.14 → 3057.90] Lucy and Peter,
[3058.32 → 3059.90] about Aslan the Lion.
[3060.68 → 3063.82] And Aslan is a powerful king.
[3063.82 → 3065.10] He is majestic.
[3065.48 → 3066.70] He is a strong lion.
[3067.00 → 3068.58] He can save all of Narnia.
[3069.62 → 3070.40] But Lucy,
[3070.64 → 3072.38] she hears about this king.
[3072.66 → 3073.60] She's not sure
[3073.60 → 3075.06] if she's ready to meet
[3075.06 → 3076.76] such a strong and powerful creature.
[3077.60 → 3079.28] And so she asks the beavers,
[3079.72 → 3081.10] is he safe?
[3082.54 → 3084.28] Safe, Mr. Beaver says.
[3084.50 → 3086.48] Who said anything about safe?
[3086.54 → 3088.00] Of course he isn't safe,
[3088.30 → 3089.80] but he's good.
[3090.46 → 3092.14] He's the king, I tell you.
[3092.14 → 3096.02] So God is powerful,
[3096.46 → 3098.84] but you couldn't really say
[3098.84 → 3100.32] he's safe.
[3101.30 → 3102.24] Verse 6 says,
[3102.62 → 3104.32] He utters his voice,
[3104.90 → 3106.18] the earth melts.
[3107.00 → 3107.20] Right?
[3107.26 → 3108.38] He is so powerful
[3108.38 → 3111.16] that he can bring all wars to cease.
[3111.28 → 3112.98] He can shatter the bow and the spear.
[3113.92 → 3116.44] God is not necessarily safe,
[3116.88 → 3118.12] but he's good.
[3118.12 → 3121.20] He's an ever-present help.
[3121.66 → 3123.16] He's the God of Jacob.
[3124.26 → 3125.20] Which means, you know,
[3125.28 → 3126.64] to the Israelites
[3126.64 → 3128.38] who were reading this psalm,
[3128.46 → 3130.38] it means the God of Jacob.
[3130.58 → 3132.10] He is the God of our fathers,
[3132.24 → 3133.86] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[3134.40 → 3135.44] He has entered
[3135.44 → 3137.84] into covenant relationship with us.
[3138.40 → 3139.66] He is our God,
[3139.78 → 3141.12] committed to us in love.
[3141.12 → 3143.70] And that is also true of us today.
[3145.34 → 3147.90] And so that is why we can rest.
[3148.60 → 3152.00] Even in the midst of the pandemic,
[3152.70 → 3155.20] even in the midst of all the troubles
[3155.20 → 3157.62] that we face today and tomorrow,
[3158.54 → 3160.96] God is our refuge and strength
[3160.96 → 3162.78] in ever-present help and trouble.
[3162.78 → 3166.20] And so that brings us to
[3166.20 → 3167.42] kind of the final point
[3167.42 → 3168.60] I want to talk about today,
[3168.68 → 3170.46] which is the cultivation of rest.
[3172.16 → 3174.48] Because it's one thing
[3174.48 → 3176.80] for us to read this psalm and say,
[3177.74 → 3179.30] okay, I know God is powerful.
[3179.78 → 3181.22] I know God is present.
[3182.16 → 3184.44] But often where we struggle,
[3185.28 → 3188.40] especially when the storms
[3188.40 → 3189.52] in our lives come,
[3190.52 → 3192.32] is to actually rest in him.
[3192.78 → 3192.94] Right?
[3192.96 → 3195.56] It's to actually experience God
[3195.56 → 3197.16] as our rest,
[3197.62 → 3198.86] as our strength and refuge,
[3198.86 → 3200.10] so that we can rest.
[3200.46 → 3201.68] And so what do we do?
[3202.02 → 3203.86] How can we rest in God?
[3205.08 → 3207.60] And the psalms give us two ways
[3207.60 → 3210.18] that we can practice rest.
[3210.62 → 3213.94] That we can be formed spiritually
[3213.94 → 3215.80] in our ability to rest.
[3216.84 → 3218.40] And there are actually two commands
[3218.40 → 3219.48] that God gives us here.
[3220.04 → 3221.04] So it's a command.
[3221.04 → 3222.60] And when, you know,
[3222.70 → 3223.98] God gives us a command,
[3224.08 → 3225.58] he's telling us to do something.
[3226.74 → 3228.40] And so the first command
[3228.40 → 3229.88] is to behold.
[3230.76 → 3232.36] And we see that in verse 8.
[3232.86 → 3233.70] It says,
[3234.26 → 3235.82] come and see
[3235.82 → 3237.42] what the Lord has done.
[3237.46 → 3238.40] Or in some translations,
[3238.60 → 3240.34] come and behold
[3240.34 → 3242.16] what the Lord has done.
[3242.70 → 3244.32] And he's talking about
[3244.32 → 3246.18] seeing in a special way.
[3246.18 → 3247.68] He's talking about seeing
[3247.68 → 3249.74] with spiritual insight.
[3250.54 → 3250.66] Right?
[3250.72 → 3252.80] And so it's not to just see,
[3252.96 → 3253.74] I can see,
[3254.04 → 3255.28] but it's to see
[3255.28 → 3256.66] and pay attention.
[3257.08 → 3257.68] Behold.
[3257.94 → 3258.30] Look.
[3261.42 → 3262.44] Maybe it's something
[3262.44 → 3263.80] we haven't noticed before.
[3264.56 → 3264.82] Right?
[3265.42 → 3266.74] And what the psalm is saying
[3266.74 → 3268.54] is that God is at work
[3268.54 → 3269.66] all around us.
[3270.02 → 3271.78] God is at work in our lives,
[3271.78 → 3273.36] but it's very easy for us
[3273.36 → 3275.12] not to see,
[3275.50 → 3276.58] not to behold
[3276.58 → 3278.14] what God is doing.
[3279.14 → 3280.08] It's very easy
[3280.08 → 3280.72] not to see
[3280.72 → 3281.64] God's presence
[3281.64 → 3282.54] with us
[3282.54 → 3283.82] in that
[3283.82 → 3285.08] he is at work.
[3286.22 → 3287.40] And so what are some ways
[3287.40 → 3288.44] that we can see
[3288.44 → 3289.54] with spiritual insight?
[3289.66 → 3290.16] What are some ways
[3290.16 → 3291.12] that we can behold?
[3292.48 → 3293.30] And one way,
[3293.40 → 3293.80] I think,
[3293.88 → 3295.48] is to just take stock
[3295.48 → 3296.44] very intentionally
[3296.44 → 3297.70] of God's activity
[3297.70 → 3298.68] in our own lives.
[3298.68 → 3299.60] You know,
[3299.66 → 3301.14] often we go through our days
[3301.14 → 3302.28] or we go through our weeks
[3302.28 → 3304.50] without seeing
[3304.50 → 3305.78] what the Lord has done.
[3307.24 → 3307.46] You know,
[3307.52 → 3309.58] God is always doing something
[3309.58 → 3310.58] in your life.
[3310.76 → 3311.80] That's what we believe.
[3312.22 → 3313.60] That God didn't just
[3313.60 → 3315.56] create us
[3315.56 → 3317.04] and save us
[3317.04 → 3318.64] and is now absent.
[3319.04 → 3319.98] But that God,
[3320.08 → 3321.18] by his Holy Spirit,
[3321.36 → 3322.16] who he has sent
[3322.16 → 3323.62] into our hearts,
[3323.72 → 3324.42] into the world,
[3324.48 → 3325.36] that he is active.
[3327.12 → 3327.68] So,
[3327.68 → 3330.60] what is God doing
[3330.60 → 3331.68] in my life?
[3332.76 → 3333.06] You know,
[3333.14 → 3333.76] and one thing
[3333.76 → 3334.84] that I have done
[3334.84 → 3336.14] some in the past,
[3336.28 → 3337.60] and I'll just say now,
[3337.92 → 3338.90] that I am not saying
[3338.90 → 3339.72] that I am good at this
[3339.72 → 3340.46] or that I do it
[3340.46 → 3341.12] very regularly.
[3341.80 → 3342.24] But,
[3342.96 → 3343.94] one thing
[3343.94 → 3345.40] that I found helpful
[3345.40 → 3346.72] and that many Christians
[3346.72 → 3348.02] throughout the centuries
[3348.02 → 3348.82] have found helpful
[3348.82 → 3350.60] is a form of prayer
[3350.60 → 3351.90] in the Christian church
[3351.90 → 3353.04] developed by
[3353.04 → 3354.54] a guy named Ignatius.
[3355.14 → 3355.70] And it's called
[3355.70 → 3356.98] the Prayer of Examine.
[3358.34 → 3359.94] And Prayer of Examine.
[3360.10 → 3361.04] It sounds kind of
[3361.04 → 3362.80] very super spiritual,
[3363.20 → 3364.40] but it's really not.
[3364.46 → 3365.46] It's very quite simple.
[3366.44 → 3366.84] So,
[3366.92 → 3367.36] basically,
[3367.54 → 3368.00] what you do
[3368.00 → 3369.04] is you get to the end
[3369.04 → 3369.68] of your day
[3369.68 → 3372.06] and you look back
[3372.06 → 3373.48] and you say,
[3373.64 → 3375.32] what just happened?
[3376.20 → 3376.64] Right?
[3376.64 → 3376.98] You know,
[3377.06 → 3378.42] often what happens
[3378.42 → 3379.40] for me,
[3379.50 → 3380.08] maybe for you,
[3380.12 → 3380.88] at the end of the day
[3380.88 → 3381.68] is you're tired,
[3382.14 → 3382.92] you kind of crash
[3382.92 → 3383.56] on the couch,
[3383.68 → 3384.60] you turn on YouTube
[3384.60 → 3385.36] or Netflix,
[3386.16 → 3387.14] and, you know,
[3387.18 → 3388.08] you just wait to do it
[3388.08 → 3389.06] all again the next day.
[3390.16 → 3390.58] But,
[3390.66 → 3391.90] this Prayer of Examine
[3391.90 → 3393.86] is to set aside
[3393.86 → 3394.62] ten minutes
[3394.62 → 3395.62] at the end of the day
[3395.62 → 3397.36] where you look back
[3397.36 → 3398.30] at that day
[3398.30 → 3399.72] and you prayerfully say,
[3400.46 → 3400.80] God,
[3400.88 → 3402.04] what were you up to
[3402.04 → 3402.72] in my life?
[3403.34 → 3403.60] Right?
[3403.60 → 3405.42] Where were you a blessing
[3405.42 → 3405.98] to me?
[3407.00 → 3409.34] Where was I close to you
[3409.34 → 3410.38] and kind of communing
[3410.38 → 3410.94] with you
[3410.94 → 3412.26] and to thank him
[3412.26 → 3412.70] for that?
[3413.46 → 3414.64] But also to pray
[3414.64 → 3415.30] and ask,
[3415.42 → 3415.62] you know,
[3415.90 → 3416.24] God,
[3416.46 → 3417.80] where was I not
[3417.80 → 3418.64] walking with you?
[3418.78 → 3419.40] Where was I,
[3419.70 → 3420.58] where was my heart
[3420.58 → 3422.16] kind of far from you?
[3422.80 → 3424.08] And what was going on
[3424.08 → 3424.76] in my heart
[3424.76 → 3426.22] that led me to do that,
[3426.28 → 3427.06] maybe to sin
[3427.06 → 3428.36] or to not trust in you?
[3430.04 → 3430.38] And so,
[3430.50 → 3432.50] one way to rest in God
[3432.50 → 3434.16] is to be attentive
[3434.16 → 3436.84] to his works
[3436.84 → 3437.70] and his presence
[3437.70 → 3438.82] in our life already.
[3439.60 → 3439.82] Right?
[3439.88 → 3441.22] Is to look at our lives
[3441.22 → 3442.42] through the lens
[3442.42 → 3443.58] of the fact that
[3443.58 → 3445.04] God really is here,
[3445.36 → 3446.82] that he really is at work.
[3447.90 → 3449.26] And to be intentional
[3449.26 → 3451.82] to practice seeing that
[3451.82 → 3453.60] and responding to it.
[3454.08 → 3454.22] Okay,
[3454.24 → 3455.20] so that's the first thing,
[3455.50 → 3456.44] the command here,
[3456.76 → 3457.28] behold.
[3458.28 → 3459.70] And the second command
[3459.70 → 3461.44] that the psalm gives us
[3461.44 → 3463.36] is to be still.
[3464.48 → 3465.90] And I love this command.
[3466.60 → 3469.14] It means to go slack.
[3469.90 → 3470.70] You can imagine
[3470.70 → 3472.20] a rushing wind
[3472.20 → 3472.84] and then it just,
[3472.90 → 3473.94] it dies off.
[3473.98 → 3474.82] It goes slack.
[3475.48 → 3476.94] It means to do nothing.
[3478.12 → 3479.78] Or one of the translations
[3479.78 → 3480.54] says
[3480.54 → 3482.44] to be lazy.
[3483.10 → 3483.40] Now,
[3483.48 → 3484.32] a lot of times
[3484.32 → 3485.44] we don't rest
[3485.44 → 3486.86] because we think
[3486.86 → 3487.70] to rest
[3487.70 → 3489.32] is laziness.
[3489.78 → 3490.12] Right?
[3490.12 → 3491.44] We have a strongly
[3491.44 → 3492.64] held belief
[3492.64 → 3494.20] that hard work
[3494.20 → 3495.18] is good
[3495.18 → 3495.94] and virtuous
[3495.94 → 3497.68] and that laziness
[3497.68 → 3498.30] is bad.
[3498.78 → 3499.52] And certainly
[3499.52 → 3500.06] that's right.
[3500.14 → 3501.50] That is what the Bible teaches.
[3502.22 → 3503.46] But we need to make
[3503.46 → 3504.14] a distinction
[3504.14 → 3505.00] between,
[3505.00 → 3505.88] you know,
[3505.92 → 3507.26] working hard
[3507.26 → 3509.34] at whatever we do
[3509.34 → 3510.78] for the glory of God
[3510.78 → 3511.92] on the one hand
[3511.92 → 3513.68] and a kind of
[3513.68 → 3515.78] frenzy of activity
[3515.78 → 3517.32] that is actually
[3517.32 → 3518.12] just trying
[3518.12 → 3518.96] to control
[3518.96 → 3519.40] everything.
[3520.72 → 3521.84] And God
[3521.84 → 3523.02] commands us
[3523.02 → 3524.54] to stop.
[3525.10 → 3526.46] Stop trying
[3526.46 → 3527.80] to control.
[3528.54 → 3529.02] He says
[3529.02 → 3529.88] in verse 10,
[3530.30 → 3531.14] be still
[3531.14 → 3532.26] and know
[3532.26 → 3533.22] that I am God.
[3534.30 → 3535.28] Chill out
[3535.28 → 3536.80] and trust
[3536.80 → 3537.36] in me.
[3538.28 → 3538.84] Don't try
[3538.84 → 3539.44] to control
[3539.44 → 3540.56] everything yourself.
[3540.56 → 3542.98] So I want
[3542.98 → 3543.62] to read
[3543.62 → 3544.46] another passage
[3544.46 → 3545.26] for us
[3545.26 → 3546.16] where we see
[3546.16 → 3547.08] this command
[3547.08 → 3548.68] to be still.
[3552.68 → 3553.32] So,
[3553.50 → 3554.64] Mark chapter 4.
[3554.64 → 3556.22] That day
[3556.22 → 3557.34] when evening came,
[3557.48 → 3558.06] Jesus said
[3558.06 → 3558.86] to his disciples,
[3559.22 → 3560.40] let us go over
[3560.40 → 3561.48] to the other side.
[3562.40 → 3563.26] Leaving the crowd
[3563.26 → 3563.80] behind,
[3563.92 → 3565.02] they took him along
[3565.02 → 3566.96] just as he was
[3566.96 → 3567.54] in the boat.
[3568.42 → 3569.40] There were also
[3569.40 → 3570.20] other boats
[3570.20 → 3570.70] with him.
[3572.44 → 3573.48] A furious
[3573.48 → 3574.26] squall
[3574.26 → 3575.00] came up
[3575.00 → 3575.96] and the waves
[3575.96 → 3577.14] broke over the boat
[3577.14 → 3577.94] so that it was
[3577.94 → 3579.04] nearly swamped.
[3579.86 → 3581.28] Jesus was in the stern
[3581.28 → 3582.60] sleeping on a cushion.
[3583.22 → 3583.74] The disciples
[3583.74 → 3584.40] woke him
[3584.40 → 3585.06] and said to him,
[3585.16 → 3585.48] teacher,
[3585.92 → 3586.96] don't you care
[3586.96 → 3587.82] if we drown?
[3589.52 → 3590.60] He got up,
[3590.86 → 3591.74] rebuked the wind
[3591.74 → 3593.10] and said to the waves,
[3593.76 → 3594.26] quiet,
[3595.04 → 3595.80] be still.
[3596.64 → 3597.28] Then the wind
[3597.28 → 3598.14] died down
[3598.14 → 3598.58] and it was
[3598.58 → 3599.66] completely calm.
[3600.26 → 3601.48] He said to his disciples,
[3602.40 → 3603.62] why are you
[3603.62 → 3604.28] so afraid?
[3605.00 → 3605.74] Do you still
[3605.74 → 3606.96] have no faith?
[3608.64 → 3610.16] They were terrified
[3610.16 → 3612.02] and asked each other,
[3612.44 → 3613.64] who is this?
[3613.64 → 3615.20] even the wind
[3615.20 → 3616.64] and the waves
[3616.64 → 3617.80] obey him.
[3619.80 → 3620.90] So what Jesus
[3620.90 → 3621.82] is doing here
[3621.82 → 3623.04] is he is
[3623.04 → 3623.92] enacting
[3623.92 → 3624.58] Psalm 46.
[3625.54 → 3626.66] He is saying,
[3627.52 → 3628.20] be still.
[3628.90 → 3629.72] And he's saying,
[3629.88 → 3630.56] be still
[3630.56 → 3631.52] to this world
[3631.52 → 3632.78] that is falling apart.
[3633.44 → 3634.46] There's this storm
[3634.46 → 3635.34] that is threatening
[3635.34 → 3636.98] to sink
[3636.98 → 3637.74] his disciples.
[3637.74 → 3640.48] So he says,
[3640.64 → 3641.26] be still
[3641.26 → 3642.04] to the storm.
[3642.04 → 3643.12] But it's not only
[3643.12 → 3643.70] a command
[3643.70 → 3645.06] to the natural world,
[3645.70 → 3646.50] the storms
[3646.50 → 3647.60] that threaten us,
[3648.08 → 3649.10] it's a command
[3649.10 → 3650.02] to us as well.
[3650.56 → 3651.40] It's a command
[3651.40 → 3652.70] to our hearts.
[3652.90 → 3654.10] Because you see
[3654.10 → 3656.32] in Mark's account
[3656.32 → 3657.20] with his disciples,
[3657.66 → 3658.78] there was a storm
[3658.78 → 3660.10] not only blowing
[3660.10 → 3660.90] around them,
[3661.12 → 3662.20] but there was a storm
[3662.20 → 3663.00] happening
[3663.00 → 3664.04] in their hearts.
[3664.04 → 3665.20] They were like,
[3665.32 → 3666.98] we're going to die.
[3667.46 → 3667.78] Jesus,
[3667.98 → 3668.78] don't you care?
[3668.92 → 3670.02] Don't you love us?
[3670.72 → 3671.52] Their hearts
[3671.52 → 3672.58] were in turmoil.
[3673.68 → 3675.34] And that's at the heart
[3675.34 → 3676.56] of all of our
[3676.56 → 3677.88] failure to rest in God.
[3678.10 → 3678.84] We doubt that
[3678.84 → 3679.92] he is powerful enough.
[3680.24 → 3681.14] We doubt that
[3681.14 → 3682.12] he is really present.
[3682.12 → 3684.62] So we can be
[3684.62 → 3686.00] overcome by anxiety.
[3686.50 → 3687.00] We can be
[3687.00 → 3688.06] overcome with worry.
[3688.66 → 3689.12] There's this
[3689.12 → 3689.90] roaring
[3689.90 → 3691.18] and trembling
[3691.18 → 3692.32] inside each
[3692.32 → 3693.54] and every one of us.
[3694.56 → 3695.38] It's not just
[3695.38 → 3696.62] out there in the world.
[3697.32 → 3698.26] It's in our hearts
[3698.26 → 3698.66] as well.
[3699.48 → 3700.60] So Jesus spoke
[3700.60 → 3701.38] the command.
[3702.24 → 3703.10] He was not only
[3703.10 → 3704.38] speaking out of the boat
[3704.38 → 3705.40] into the storm,
[3706.04 → 3707.44] but he was speaking
[3707.44 → 3708.90] to his disciples
[3708.90 → 3709.68] in the boat.
[3710.36 → 3711.44] And he was speaking
[3711.44 → 3712.98] to you
[3712.98 → 3714.22] and to me
[3714.22 → 3715.62] as we read this.
[3716.20 → 3717.00] And he's saying,
[3717.54 → 3718.08] be still.
[3719.84 → 3720.86] So this morning,
[3721.00 → 3722.66] I want to invite us
[3722.66 → 3724.30] to apply this psalm
[3724.30 → 3724.94] to our lives.
[3725.00 → 3726.06] How are we to respond
[3726.06 → 3726.82] to this psalm?
[3727.70 → 3728.56] And I think the way
[3728.56 → 3730.06] for us to respond
[3730.06 → 3731.64] is to receive
[3731.64 → 3732.38] this command.
[3733.38 → 3734.68] And by faith,
[3734.80 → 3735.74] begin to obey
[3735.74 → 3736.42] this command.
[3737.02 → 3737.62] To say,
[3738.18 → 3738.82] okay, Lord,
[3739.24 → 3740.96] I am going to be still.
[3741.44 → 3741.88] Right?
[3742.12 → 3743.44] I am going to begin
[3743.44 → 3744.10] to trust.
[3745.02 → 3746.24] So let me pray
[3746.24 → 3747.06] that God would help us
[3747.06 → 3747.40] do that.
[3747.62 → 3748.24] Let's pray together.
[3751.44 → 3752.66] God, when the
[3752.66 → 3754.56] storms come,
[3755.56 → 3756.96] not only is there
[3756.96 → 3758.30] trouble all around us,
[3758.38 → 3758.70] but Lord,
[3758.78 → 3759.44] there is a
[3759.44 → 3760.58] trembling,
[3761.26 → 3762.44] there is a flurry
[3762.44 → 3763.30] in our hearts.
[3763.30 → 3765.32] So Lord,
[3765.38 → 3766.22] you come to us
[3766.22 → 3767.00] and you say,
[3767.30 → 3769.06] I am your refuge
[3769.06 → 3770.02] and your strength.
[3770.86 → 3772.06] I am your help.
[3773.42 → 3774.34] Be quiet.
[3775.20 → 3775.76] So Lord,
[3775.86 → 3776.64] we ask that you
[3776.64 → 3777.32] would help us.
[3778.28 → 3779.34] That even though
[3779.34 → 3780.28] things are
[3780.28 → 3781.56] going to happen
[3781.56 → 3782.18] and you
[3782.18 → 3783.16] don't promise
[3783.16 → 3783.90] that they won't,
[3784.94 → 3785.30] but Lord,
[3785.36 → 3785.74] you say,
[3785.90 → 3786.66] even in the midst
[3786.66 → 3787.18] of trouble,
[3787.68 → 3788.68] that you are present
[3788.68 → 3789.66] and that you are powerful.
[3789.66 → 3790.30] So Lord,
[3790.36 → 3791.08] we need you
[3791.08 → 3793.10] and we need
[3793.10 → 3793.80] to trust in you.
[3793.92 → 3794.28] So Lord,
[3794.36 → 3795.32] teach us peace.
[3796.24 → 3796.38] Lord,
[3796.44 → 3797.14] help us to rest
[3797.14 → 3797.56] and help us
[3797.56 → 3798.62] to sing this song,
[3799.40 → 3801.62] to sing this psalm
[3801.62 → 3802.08] and say,
[3802.22 → 3802.70] may the devil
[3802.70 → 3803.42] do his worst
[3803.42 → 3804.38] because I
[3804.38 → 3806.16] am in Christ.
[3806.82 → 3807.34] We pray
[3807.34 → 3808.24] in Jesus' name.
[3808.90 → 3809.16] Amen.
[3809.16 → 3809.26] Amen.
[3809.26 → 3809.30] Amen.
[3809.30 → 3809.32] Amen.
[3809.32 → 3811.26] Amen.
[3811.26 → 3811.32] Amen.
[3811.32 → 3811.40] Amen.
[3811.40 → 3813.32] Amen.
[3813.32 → 3815.32] Amen.
[3815.32 → 3815.34] Amen.
[3815.34 → 3815.38] Amen.
[3815.38 → 3817.32] Amen.
[3817.32 → 3817.38] Amen.
[3817.38 → 3817.88] Amen.
[3817.88 → 3818.38] Amen.
[3818.38 → 3819.12] Amen.
[3819.12 → 3819.22] Amen.
[3819.22 → 3819.64] Amen.
[3819.64 → 3849.62] Amen.
[3849.62 → 3858.54] Jesus said that if I thirst,
[3858.54 → 3863.40] I should come to Him.
[3863.40 → 3869.12] No one else can satisfy,
[3869.58 → 3874.10] I should come to Him.
[3874.10 → 3874.54] Amen.
[3874.54 → 3886.46] Jesus said that if I am free, I should come to Him.
[3886.46 → 3895.46] No one else can be my strength, I should come to Him.
[3895.46 → 3896.38] For the Lord is good, I should come to Him.
[3896.38 → 3907.16] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and high.
[3907.16 → 3917.94] We will always come to Jesus, Jesus, come and die.
[3917.94 → 3920.08] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[3920.08 → 3935.04] Amen.
[3935.04 → 3936.90] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[3936.90 → 3938.76] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[3938.76 → 3948.36] No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[3948.36 → 3959.32] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will lead us day and night.
[3959.32 → 3970.40] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus' love and life.
[3978.78 → 3988.32] Jesus said, if I am lost, He will come to me.
[3989.32 → 4000.14] At His show, He's on the cross, He will come to me.
[4000.74 → 4010.88] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will lead us day and night.
[4010.88 → 4021.70] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus' love and life.
[4021.70 → 4032.18] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will lead us day and night.
[4032.52 → 4042.82] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus' love and life.
[4042.82 → 4047.82] Jesus' love and life.
[4047.82 → 4059.24] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus' love and life.
[4059.24 → 4070.06] Jesus' love and life.
[4070.06 → 4076.82] I'm automatically going to say, please, please be seated.
[4076.82 → 4077.82] But there's nobody here.
[4077.82 → 4078.82] It's too bad.
[4078.82 → 4083.82] But anyway, now is the time for the offering.
[4083.82 → 4087.64] And the offering will be on your screen this morning.
[4087.64 → 4096.68] And it's kind of an odd way, again, of how to offer.
[4096.68 → 4101.18] But if you have any questions about this, again, you can phone the secretary during the week.
[4101.18 → 4106.18] But please remember the organizations you give money for our offerings.
[4106.18 → 4109.18] They're hurting big time because of this whole crisis.
[4109.18 → 4111.18] Many are, of course, non-profits.
[4111.18 → 4119.18] And, so please remember them in their prayers and in your giving.
[4119.18 → 4125.18] Before we go to our community prayer, as we heard this morning in the message,
[4125.18 → 4129.42] the psalmist says, be still and know that I am God.
[4129.42 → 4132.56] And we want to be that before we come to the Lord our God in prayer.
[4133.46 → 4135.90] But we're going to do that in singing, this beautiful hymn,
[4136.34 → 4138.78] be still and know that I am God.
[4138.86 → 4139.90] And let's do this prayerfully.
[4149.18 → 4179.16] Be still and know that I am God.
[4179.18 → 4184.30] That I am God.
[4184.30 → 4194.60] Be still and know that I am God.
[4194.60 → 4204.96] Be still and know that I am God.
[4204.96 → 4224.96] In you, O Lord, I put my trust.
[4224.96 → 4236.68] In you, O Lord, I put my trust.
[4236.68 → 4245.30] Lord our God, you are our refuge and strength.
[4246.68 → 4248.50] You are our mighty fortress.
[4249.96 → 4252.94] And you never leave us, and you never forsake us.
[4252.94 → 4260.80] What a great comfort that is to know this morning and every day of the life of your children.
[4260.80 → 4266.00] Thank you above all, Lord, for your faithfulness in sending your Son.
[4266.00 → 4268.00] The work of Christ.
[4268.00 → 4268.38] The work of Christ.
[4268.38 → 4276.24] To suffer, to die, to rise again, to ascend and one day to come again.
[4276.24 → 4284.72] And Lord God, when that is our confession, then we can also come to you with boldness.
[4284.90 → 4294.86] The only way we can come in boldness to you is because of our faith in Jesus Christ and what he has done for us, shedding his blood on that cross.
[4294.86 → 4303.44] And so, Lord God, as we come to you this morning, your congregation, your people in this world, but also here in Latin America.
[4304.62 → 4311.94] Lord, we bring before you our Thanksgiving for everything that you have done for us, even in these times of challenges.
[4313.46 → 4318.50] But, Lord God, we also want to bring before you this morning the needs of this congregation.
[4318.50 → 4332.26] And, Lord God, as we pray every Sunday, and we should pray every day, Lord God, we pray for the members in our church who are struggling with cancer, that horrible disease.
[4333.08 → 4334.84] We bring before you Kathy Scott.
[4336.00 → 4344.42] And we bring before you Joan and Tim, as they all three struggle, Lord God, day by day.
[4344.42 → 4351.28] And as we go on, may they continue to put their trust in you, our rock and our redeemer.
[4353.12 → 4367.58] Lord God, we are reminded again today, and because of these weeks that go on and on of isolation, of members in our church, brothers and sisters in Christ, who are shut in senior and other homes.
[4369.36 → 4374.38] We want to pray especially this morning, Lord, for Bill and for his wife Sandy and his family.
[4374.42 → 4379.16] As Bill's health, as we know, is in rapid decline.
[4380.36 → 4381.34] Lord God, be with them.
[4381.46 → 4386.56] Be with Hank and Jean, as they are separated from one another.
[4388.06 → 4391.56] Be with Get, as she's getting older, and all these challenges.
[4393.04 → 4402.96] With Joyce and others, Lord, who are again in these homes, where they cannot be visited, where they cannot go out.
[4402.96 → 4408.94] We pray, Lord, for Cor, as his health and his mind is declining as well.
[4409.90 → 4415.44] For Grace and her family, as he is always at home.
[4415.44 → 4426.98] Heavenly Father, we pray this morning for Robin, a faithful visitor and friend of this church, who told us about the passing away of her stepfather.
[4427.12 → 4437.46] Will you be with her in these difficult days again, where we cannot even often, as family and friends, say goodbye to those who pass on?
[4437.46 → 4440.80] And Lord God, in that same line, we pray for Gary.
[4443.00 → 4452.40] For those whose life is so difficult because restaurants and coffee shops and McDonald's are closed for fellowship.
[4452.40 → 4459.90] And Lord God, as we pray for this congregation, we also want to pray again for your world.
[4461.00 → 4473.12] And as we are bombarded with COVID-19 news, ad nauseam, Lord God, we also know that other things are happening in this world which need attention and which we have to pray for.
[4473.12 → 4478.70] For this terrible cyclone in Pakistan and in India.
[4479.46 → 4487.14] For the locust plague of biblical proportions, again in Pakistan and in East Africa.
[4488.60 → 4493.04] Lord God, we want to pray for the economy.
[4493.04 → 4504.56] And the humongous amount of people, tremendous amount of people that are suddenly unemployed, who lose a sense of dignity worldwide.
[4504.92 → 4508.52] Lord God, we pray that this all may come to an end.
[4509.52 → 4516.38] And that jobs may be there again for those people and for their families.
[4518.14 → 4520.66] And therefore, Lord, we also pray for governments in this world.
[4520.66 → 4526.02] Lord God, may they confess, or come to confess, that you are the fortress.
[4526.72 → 4528.08] And that you are the strength.
[4528.72 → 4531.30] And that you are the ever-present help in trouble.
[4532.14 → 4537.90] And not our human way of thinking and our intellect.
[4539.08 → 4545.48] And so, Lord God, we pray there also for insight, for wisdom, based on your word.
[4545.48 → 4552.00] Heavenly Father, we pray again for the increasing tension in Hong Kong.
[4552.90 → 4556.20] For freedom versus oppression.
[4556.86 → 4559.76] Lord God, will you bring a solution in that place.
[4561.44 → 4565.44] And Heavenly Father, we pray again for the people we know.
[4567.00 → 4572.44] And Lord, this morning I want to pray especially for, again, friends of our congregation who live in Point Roberts.
[4572.44 → 4573.54] Who are stuck.
[4573.92 → 4575.16] Who would love to be here too.
[4575.74 → 4578.60] To give praise and music to your holy name.
[4578.74 → 4579.34] Be with them.
[4579.86 → 4581.24] And may we pray again for them.
[4581.30 → 4582.64] And help them and encourage them.
[4582.90 → 4583.88] Like many others.
[4584.90 → 4587.68] Lord, as we need.
[4587.84 → 4588.84] All desperately need that.
[4589.14 → 4590.42] Lord God, we pray for your church.
[4591.30 → 4592.20] For Pastor Jason.
[4593.08 → 4595.12] For whom it must be difficult.
[4595.66 → 4597.44] To stand here like all the other pastors.
[4597.44 → 4601.20] To pray for empty pews.
[4601.96 → 4603.52] And so, Lord God, we pray for the day.
[4604.14 → 4605.44] That we may come together again.
[4606.82 → 4609.00] And Heavenly Father, we pray for next week.
[4609.52 → 4613.46] That we may celebrate again the outpouring of your Holy Spirit.
[4614.04 → 4615.08] What an amazing thing.
[4615.18 → 4616.32] The world has never been the same.
[4617.04 → 4618.42] And that your church is still growing.
[4619.14 → 4621.44] May it also grow and flourish in our church.
[4621.44 → 4622.52] And in this community.
[4623.22 → 4625.78] That your spirit is at work.
[4626.40 → 4629.40] Who always gives the gifts.
[4630.04 → 4632.46] According to what he says and what he does.
[4633.44 → 4634.24] His plan.
[4635.20 → 4636.80] And so, Lord God, as we leave this place.
[4637.46 → 4638.38] Will you be with us?
[4638.48 → 4639.60] And will you watch over us?
[4640.16 → 4641.24] Will you encourage us?
[4641.38 → 4642.90] And remind us again, Lord.
[4643.24 → 4644.92] That we have to be still before you.
[4645.66 → 4648.38] And that you are our fortress and our strength.
[4648.38 → 4651.82] And ever-present help in trouble.
[4652.08 → 4653.06] We praise your holy name.
[4653.98 → 4656.10] Through Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[4657.08 → 4657.52] Amen.
[4668.52 → 4670.82] So, as we finish our worship service.
[4670.92 → 4673.16] And before we finish, sing our final song.
[4673.86 → 4676.72] Let us go forth with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4676.72 → 4678.26] So, I invite you to hold out your hands.
[4678.58 → 4680.60] As a gesture of receiving his blessing.
[4682.02 → 4684.78] Now, to him who is able to keep you from falling.
[4685.34 → 4687.86] And to present you before his glorious presence.
[4688.28 → 4690.04] Without fault and with great joy.
[4690.90 → 4692.48] To the only God, our Saviour.
[4692.64 → 4695.44] Be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[4696.12 → 4697.88] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[4698.16 → 4700.36] Before all ages, now and forever.
[4701.16 → 4701.46] Amen.
[4701.46 → 4701.56] Amen.
[4706.72 → 4710.34] Amen.
[4710.34 → 4725.60] A mighty fortress is above.
[4725.60 → 4727.60] Amen.
[4755.60 → 4757.60] Amen.
[4785.60 → 4798.60] That word of all, of all earthly minds, no, thanks to them abiding.
[4800.06 → 4811.70] The Spirit that Thou gives us, through Him who with us neither.
[4811.70 → 4822.70] Let good and good go, this mortal life also.
[4824.06 → 4833.70] The glory they may give, the strength of our lives still.
[4833.70 → 4840.70] His kingdom is forever.
[4840.70 → 4842.70] The glory of all.
[4842.70 → 4843.70] The glory of all.
[4843.70 → 4845.70] The glory of all.
[4845.70 → 4847.70] Amen.
[4847.70 → 4848.70] Amen.
[4848.70 → 4850.70] Amen.
[4850.70 → 4852.70] Thank you.
[4852.70 → 4854.70] Amen.
[4854.70 → 4856.70] Amen.
[4856.70 → 4858.70] Amen.
[4858.70 → 4860.70] Amen.
[4860.70 → 4861.70] Amen.
[4861.70 → 4862.70] Amen.
[4862.70 → 4863.70] Amen.
[4892.70 → 4894.70] Amen.
