[1224.34 → 1228.60] I should come to Him
[1228.60 → 1233.66] No one else can satisfy
[1233.66 → 1238.34] I should come to Him
[1238.34 → 1244.34] Jesus said if I am weak
[1244.34 → 1249.02] I should come to Him
[1249.02 → 1254.52] No one else can be my strength
[1254.52 → 1258.52] I should come to Him
[1258.52 → 1263.92] For the Lord is good and faithful
[1263.92 → 1268.70] He will keep us day and night

[1273.72 → 1278.88] Jesus, Jesus, come and calm
[1278.88 → 1291.66] Jesus said that if I fear
[1291.66 → 1295.72] I should come to Him

[1300.72 → 1301.72] I should come to Him

[1305.72 → 1310.72] For the Lord is good and faithful
[1310.72 → 1314.72] He will keep us day and night
[1314.72 → 1319.72] We can always run to Jesus

[1323.72 → 1330.72] Jesus, strong and calm
[1330.72 → 1337.90] Jesus said if I am lost
[1337.90 → 1342.72] He will come to me
[1342.72 → 1347.90] And He showed me on that cross
[1347.90 → 1351.72] He will come to me
[1351.72 → 1356.72] For the Lord is good and faithful
[1356.72 → 1360.72] He will keep us day and night

[1401.72 → 1405.72] �談
[1405.72 → 1407.72] He will keep us day and day and night
[1407.72 → 1408.72] Someone gives us day and day all
[1408.72 → 1413.72] He will keep us day and night
[1413.72 → 1414.72] continuation
[1414.72 → 1415.72] And today Jesus said that when we know
[1415.72 → 1417.00] It says in the Psalms,
[1417.36 → 1419.90] While I kept silent, my body wasted away,
[1420.32 → 1422.10] through my groaning all day long.
[1422.58 → 1425.82] It isn't good for our well-being and for our relationships
[1425.82 → 1427.38] to hide our wrongdoings.
[1428.04 → 1430.78] Brushing it off and moving past it just doesn't work.
[1431.38 → 1433.52] That's why we must acknowledge our wrongdoing
[1433.52 → 1436.24] and ask for forgiveness from those we have offended,
[1437.06 → 1438.92] and how much more so to our God.
[1439.32 → 1441.88] This is why we take the time each Sunday
[1441.88 → 1444.08] to come before God to name our sin
[1444.08 → 1445.88] and ask God for forgiveness
[1445.88 → 1448.86] so that we can remove the barrier or obstacle
[1448.86 → 1451.62] that is keeping us from a close relationship with Him.
[1452.22 → 1452.98] And you know what?
[1453.40 → 1457.38] God is so good and so patient to forgive us every time.
[1458.60 → 1461.04] That thing we keep doing over and over again
[1461.04 → 1462.94] or that big thing no one knows about,
[1463.54 → 1466.16] God knows, and He forgives, and He loves us.
[1466.64 → 1468.04] Let's come to God and pray.
[1468.88 → 1471.34] Dear Lord, we come before you this morning
[1471.34 → 1473.86] to acknowledge the sins we have committed this week.
[1474.08 → 1476.40] The little sins and the big ones.
[1476.70 → 1478.46] The ones we think aren't that bad
[1478.46 → 1480.40] and the sins that fill us with shame
[1480.40 → 1481.64] when we are reminded of them.
[1482.62 → 1484.42] Thank you for your patience with us
[1484.42 → 1486.32] and your willingness to forgive us
[1486.32 → 1487.94] every time we humbly ask.
[1488.54 → 1491.16] Please walk with us as we go about this new week,
[1491.74 → 1493.52] helping us to be your image bearers.
[1493.86 → 1495.42] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1495.42 → 1498.04] It says in Romans 8,
[1498.04 → 1501.00] For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[1501.56 → 1502.80] neither angels nor demons,
[1503.10 → 1504.62] near the present or the future,
[1504.98 → 1508.08] nor any powers, nor any heights nor depth,
[1508.24 → 1510.10] nor anything else in all creation
[1510.10 → 1512.94] will be able to separate us from the love of God
[1512.94 → 1514.90] that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1516.14 → 1518.44] Because God sent His Son to die for us,
[1518.58 → 1519.92] we can rest in this promise.
[1520.78 → 1523.08] Absolutely nothing will keep us from God.
[1523.08 → 1525.14] We just need to simply come to Him
[1525.14 → 1526.68] and acknowledge our sin,
[1526.88 → 1528.30] and He desires to forgive.
[1528.92 → 1530.28] Let's sing in Christ alone.
[1530.28 → 1550.52] In Christ alone, my hope is found.
[1550.98 → 1555.28] He is my light, my strength, my song.
[1555.28 → 1560.66] This cornerstone, this solid ground,
[1561.08 → 1562.50] far through the cruises,
[1562.86 → 1565.40] drought and storm.
[1565.90 → 1570.60] What heights of love, what depths of peace,
[1571.04 → 1573.60] when fears are still,
[1573.76 → 1575.78] when straining cease,
[1576.24 → 1578.28] they grow the death,
[1578.74 → 1580.28] but all in all,
[1581.56 → 1584.40] even the love of Christ,
[1584.40 → 1585.40] and the love of Christ.
[1585.40 → 1590.68] Let's sing in Christ alone,
[1590.94 → 1593.36] who took on flesh,
[1593.80 → 1597.40] fullness of God in helpless faith,
[1598.46 → 1600.54] His gift of love,
[1600.94 → 1602.22] and righteousness,
[1603.70 → 1607.86] sparked by the wounds He came to save.
[1608.32 → 1610.40] Till on their course,
[1611.04 → 1612.40] as Jesus died,
[1612.40 → 1613.40] when I will come to save.
[1613.40 → 1614.40] When I will come to save.
[1614.40 → 1615.40] When I will come to save.
[1615.40 → 1623.64] For every sin on Him was laid,
[1623.64 → 1628.76] He in the death of Christ I live.
[1628.76 → 1633.76] There in the ground,
[1633.76 → 1635.90] His body lay,
[1635.90 → 1638.78] like of the world,
[1638.78 → 1641.68] my darkness saved.
[1641.76 → 1643.76] Then cross the floor,
[1644.76 → 1646.76] in glorious day,
[1647.66 → 1648.88] out from the grave,
[1649.08 → 1651.84] He rose again.
[1651.84 → 1653.84] and I'll descend,
[1653.84 → 1654.84] and I'll descend,
[1654.84 → 1655.84] in victory,
[1655.84 → 1661.84] since Christ has lost His grip on me.
[1661.84 → 1663.84] For I is,
[1663.84 → 1667.10] and He is mine,
[1667.58 → 1668.02] Lord,
[1668.08 → 1672.10] with the precious blood of Christ.
[1672.10 → 1676.10] No guilt in awe,
[1676.10 → 1679.10] no fear in death,
[1679.10 → 1684.28] this is the power of Christ in me.
[1684.28 → 1685.28] For my sins,
[1685.28 → 1686.28] for my sins,
[1686.28 → 1689.56] cry to final breath,
[1690.28 → 1693.28] Jesus commands my destiny.
[1694.28 → 1696.28] No power of hell,
[1696.28 → 1698.28] no sin of man,
[1699.28 → 1703.28] can never block me from His hand.
[1703.28 → 1705.28] Till He returns,
[1705.28 → 1707.28] will cause me home,
[1707.28 → 1715.28] He in the power of words I stand.
[1735.28 → 1740.28] Well,
[1740.28 → 1742.28] good morning, friends.
[1742.28 → 1744.28] I don't know about you,
[1744.28 → 1747.28] but I actually miss you all being here.
[1747.28 → 1749.28] It was a beautiful singing this morning,
[1749.28 → 1752.28] and I'm sure it sounded much better here
[1752.28 → 1755.28] than it did probably on your device.
[1755.28 → 1760.28] But we continue to pray that God would bring us back together soon.
[1761.28 → 1763.28] Well, during this season of Easter,
[1763.28 → 1768.28] we're in a series in the Psalms called Singing the New Song.
[1769.28 → 1772.28] The Psalms are this collection of 150 songs,
[1773.28 → 1775.28] so it's kind of like a hymnal.
[1775.28 → 1779.28] And the Psalms were intended to be sung.
[1779.28 → 1782.28] They would be sung in the worship in Israel.
[1783.28 → 1786.28] And yet, also in this more intimate way,
[1786.28 → 1790.28] the Psalms are also a gift from God to us,
[1790.28 → 1794.28] inviting us to live our whole lives before Him,
[1794.28 → 1796.28] and in dialogue with Him.
[1796.28 → 1800.28] God invites us through the words of the Psalm
[1800.28 → 1804.28] to bring our joys and our sorrows,
[1804.28 → 1807.28] our fear and our hope,
[1807.28 → 1810.28] our doubts and our praise to Him.
[1810.28 → 1814.28] It's why John Calvin called the Psalms
[1814.28 → 1816.28] the anatomy of the soul.
[1816.28 → 1819.28] Because in them, you find the whole spectrum
[1819.28 → 1825.28] of human emotion and of our experience in this world.
[1825.28 → 1831.28] So this morning, we're looking at Psalm 19
[1831.28 → 1834.28] as a psalm of wonder.
[1834.28 → 1837.28] And it's a song and a prayer
[1837.28 → 1840.28] about how God intends to be known
[1840.28 → 1843.28] in and through the beauty of creation
[1843.28 → 1846.28] and the beauty of His Word.
[1846.28 → 1851.28] And here is what C.S. Lewis, in his short book,
[1851.28 → 1855.28] Reflections on the Psalms, says about Psalm 19.
[1855.28 → 1857.28] He says this,
[1857.28 → 1862.28] I take this psalm to be the greatest poem
[1862.28 → 1864.28] in all the Psalter
[1864.28 → 1869.28] and one of the greatest lyrics in the world.
[1869.28 → 1871.28] That is high praise.
[1871.28 → 1876.28] And so let's read Psalm 19 together.
[1876.28 → 1880.28] And we'll have the words up on the screen.
[1880.28 → 1887.28] For the director of music, a psalm of David.
[1887.28 → 1890.28] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[1890.28 → 1894.28] The skies proclaim the work of His hands.
[1894.28 → 1897.28] Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[1897.28 → 1900.28] Night after night, they reveal knowledge.
[1900.28 → 1903.28] They have no speech.
[1903.28 → 1905.28] They use no words.
[1905.28 → 1908.28] No sound is heard from them.
[1908.28 → 1911.28] Yet their voice goes out into all the earth.
[1911.28 → 1914.28] Their words to the ends of the world.
[1914.28 → 1919.28] In the heavens, God has pitched a tent for the sun.
[1919.28 → 1923.28] It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
[1923.28 → 1927.28] like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
[1927.28 → 1932.28] It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other.
[1932.28 → 1937.28] Nothing is deprived of its warmth.
[1938.28 → 1942.28] The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul.
[1942.28 → 1948.28] The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[1948.28 → 1953.28] The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart.
[1953.28 → 1959.28] The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
[1959.28 → 1964.28] The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.
[1964.28 → 1969.28] The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.
[1969.28 → 1973.28] They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold.
[1973.28 → 1977.28] They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.
[1977.28 → 1983.28] By them your servant is warned, and keeping them is great reward.
[1983.28 → 1988.28] But who can discern their own errors?
[1988.28 → 1990.28] Forgive my hidden faults.
[1990.28 → 1993.28] Keep your servant also from wilful sins.
[1993.28 → 1995.28] May they not rule over me.
[1995.28 → 1999.28] Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
[1999.28 → 2003.28] May these words of my mouth, and this meditation of my heart,
[2003.28 → 2006.28] be pleasing in your sight.
[2006.28 → 2010.28] Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[2010.28 → 2012.28] This is the word of the Lord.
[2012.28 → 2014.28] Thanks be to God.
[2014.28 → 2015.28] Let's pray together.
[2017.28 → 2021.28] Our Heavenly Father, as we come before you, we come before your word.
[2022.28 → 2025.28] We pray as you taught us to pray in Psalm 19.
[2026.28 → 2034.28] May the words of my mouth and the meditation of all of our hearts be pleasing and acceptable in your sight.
[2034.28 → 2038.28] O Lord, our rock and our redeemer.
[2038.28 → 2041.28] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2043.28 → 2048.28] So I want to invite you to picture a scene that happens in our home from time to time.
[2049.28 → 2055.28] So Friday night, two days ago, we were playing the card game Sushi Go as a family.
[2056.28 → 2062.28] And I hadn't played the game in quite a while, and actually I forget rules quite easily.
[2062.28 → 2065.28] So I asked Christy to tell me the rules of the game.
[2065.28 → 2067.28] But I was only half listening.
[2067.28 → 2072.28] So we get to the end of the game, and we tally up the points from the hand.
[2072.28 → 2077.28] And my daughter Ellie says, Dad, how many puddings do you have?
[2077.28 → 2081.28] So in the game, one of the cards is pudding.
[2082.28 → 2083.28] It looks like this.
[2083.28 → 2085.28] Kids, do you see it on the screen?
[2085.28 → 2086.28] I think it's down here.
[2086.28 → 2091.28] Well, I said, I don't have any pudding.
[2092.28 → 2098.28] And Ellie said, okay, that's minus six points for Dad.
[2099.28 → 2107.28] And so it turns out the rule is that the person with the fewest number of puddings gets minus six points.
[2107.28 → 2109.28] And I was like, what?
[2109.28 → 2111.28] No one ever told me that.
[2111.28 → 2115.28] And Christy said, yes, I told you.
[2115.28 → 2118.28] You just weren't what?
[2118.28 → 2119.28] Listening.
[2120.28 → 2122.28] You weren't listening.
[2122.28 → 2125.28] And maybe that resonates with you.
[2125.28 → 2135.28] You know, maybe you've experienced that before with your spouse or kids or coworkers where people are speaking to you, and you're kind of listening.
[2135.28 → 2140.28] You kind of hear them, but you weren't really listening.
[2141.28 → 2148.28] You see, one of the claims of the Bible and that we see in Psalm 19 is that we are bad listeners.
[2148.28 → 2152.28] God is speaking to us.
[2152.28 → 2156.28] And yet so often we are not listening.
[2157.28 → 2160.28] And friends, this plays out in so many ways in our lives.
[2160.28 → 2166.28] You know, maybe for some of you, as soon as the preacher starts talking, you just tune out.
[2167.28 → 2169.28] Find something else to do or think about.
[2169.28 → 2172.28] Or maybe, you know, you haven't read your Bible in a while.
[2173.28 → 2177.28] Or maybe you think that God doesn't really have anything to say to you.
[2178.28 → 2180.28] Into what's going on in your life.
[2181.28 → 2187.28] So, wherever you find yourself, I want to ask you an important question this morning.
[2187.28 → 2189.28] Are you listening to God?
[2190.28 → 2193.28] Are you listening to God?
[2194.28 → 2197.28] And if you are, how are you listening?
[2198.28 → 2204.28] And what does listening to God look like for you in this season of your life?
[2205.28 → 2206.28] That's the question of Psalm 19.
[2206.28 → 2208.28] Are you listening to God?
[2209.28 → 2213.28] But the even greater news of Psalm 19 is that God is speaking.
[2214.28 → 2215.28] God is speaking to us.
[2216.28 → 2218.28] God does not leave us alone.
[2219.28 → 2220.28] He knows we're bad listeners.
[2221.28 → 2226.28] He knows that so often we do not have an ear for his voice.
[2226.28 → 2236.28] And yet, Psalm 19 is a song of wonder and amazement at the reality that God loves to be known.
[2237.28 → 2240.28] God loves to be known by us.
[2240.28 → 2241.28] God loves to be known by us.
[2241.28 → 2243.28] And he is revealing himself to us.
[2243.28 → 2247.28] He is pouring out knowledge of who he is.
[2247.28 → 2256.28] And he wants us to hear it, to take it in, to know him and to be known by him.
[2256.28 → 2263.28] And then, in being known and in knowing to be caught up in wonder and in praise.
[2264.28 → 2266.28] And that's the invitation of this Psalm.
[2266.28 → 2271.28] So this morning, I want to look at two questions together.
[2272.28 → 2275.28] First, how is God revealing himself?
[2276.28 → 2278.28] And then secondly, what might that mean for us?
[2279.28 → 2280.28] How is God revealing himself?
[2281.28 → 2283.28] And what might that mean for us?
[2283.28 → 2286.28] So first, how has God revealed himself?
[2287.28 → 2292.28] And in this Psalm, we have this clear depiction of God revealing himself in two ways.
[2292.28 → 2299.28] He is revealing himself through and in his world and his word.
[2300.28 → 2302.28] His world and his word.
[2302.28 → 2303.28] So let's look at these together.
[2304.28 → 2308.28] First, God reveals himself in and through the world.
[2309.28 → 2312.28] That is to say, God speaks through his creation.
[2313.28 → 2315.28] So look at verse 1.
[2315.28 → 2318.28] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[2319.28 → 2323.28] The skies proclaim the work of his hands.
[2324.28 → 2333.28] So this is a picture celebrating and praising God as his glory and his power are seen and heard in the beauty of this creation.
[2334.28 → 2339.28] And these reflections are anchored in the larger story of the Bible.
[2339.28 → 2341.28] In Genesis 1, it says,
[2341.28 → 2371.28] 
[2371.28 → 2372.28] This world benediction.
[2372.28 → 2373.28] It is good.
[2373.28 → 2374.28] It is good.
[2374.28 → 2375.28] It is good.
[2375.28 → 2377.28] God, this world is good.
[2377.28 → 2382.28] And this Psalm is really speaking that benediction back to God.
[2382.28 → 2383.28] It's saying,
[2383.28 → 2386.28] Yes, it is so good.
[2386.28 → 2388.28] The heavens declare your glory.
[2388.28 → 2390.28] The sky is your handiwork.
[2390.28 → 2391.28] The sky is your handiwork.
[2391.28 → 2398.28] And, you know, yes, we know that sin is real and has entered the world.
[2399.28 → 2402.28] You know, and it touches every part of creation.
[2402.28 → 2410.28] But there remains an indelible beauty and glory in all of God's works that cannot be silenced.
[2410.28 → 2418.28] And if you were simply to walk out of your doors these last few weeks, you saw it.
[2418.28 → 2421.28] I mean, there is beauty all around us.
[2421.28 → 2424.28] And it declares the glory of God.
[2424.28 → 2435.28] The psalm is inviting us to imagine the entire world around us as being full of creatures that witness to God's glory.
[2435.28 → 2445.28] The sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains that we can see, the trees, the lakes, the rivers, the oceans, the fields that we plow.
[2445.28 → 2452.28] The chorus of creatures that we hear chirping and buzzing and barking and growling.
[2452.28 → 2462.28] And these are parts of the created world that in some ways are better preachers than any human would ever be.
[2462.28 → 2469.28] Because they can point to the beauty of God's creation in ways that words simply can't communicate.
[2469.28 → 2481.28] In fact, God's glory in his creation is so clear and present that it transcends geographical and language barriers.
[2481.28 → 2483.28] So look at verse 4.
[2483.28 → 2484.28] It says,
[2484.28 → 2490.28] Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.
[2490.28 → 2491.28] Right?
[2491.28 → 2498.28] In other words, the created world, the works of God, witness to their creator in a way
[2498.28 → 2516.28] that all people in all places in all times can see and hear and know God's greatness, his kindness, his creativity, and his provision for every one of us.
[2516.28 → 2520.28] And so here's our first key word for this morning.
[2520.28 → 2521.28] Kids, are you ready?
[2521.28 → 2523.28] Here's a key word for you.
[2523.28 → 2526.28] This is called general revelation.
[2526.28 → 2527.28] Say it with me.
[2527.28 → 2529.28] General revelation.
[2529.28 → 2536.28] General revelation is knowledge about God which is available to absolutely everybody.
[2536.28 → 2539.28] You know, think about a painting.
[2539.28 → 2544.28] Just as a painting reveals the qualities of the painter.
[2544.28 → 2547.28] You know what kind of paint do they use?
[2547.28 → 2548.28] What medium?
[2548.28 → 2550.28] What kind of colours?
[2550.28 → 2551.28] What kind of colours?
[2551.28 → 2556.28] Just like that, God's world speaks of him.
[2556.28 → 2561.28] Even if we were to burn all the Bibles and drown all the preachers.
[2561.28 → 2563.28] And I'm not suggesting that we do that.
[2563.28 → 2575.28] Even though, if that were the case, the psalmist says that God would still make his power, his beauty, his goodness known through creation.
[2575.28 → 2579.28] There's a lot we can know about God from the world he created.
[2579.28 → 2582.28] But still, we have other questions.
[2582.28 → 2594.28] And usually the most important questions about God, about ourselves, about the world, that we can't answer by listening to the world.
[2594.28 → 2605.28] So, suppose your friend asks, you know, they say to you, you know, when I look at the beauty of this world, I know there must be a God.
[2605.28 → 2607.28] But here's my question.
[2607.28 → 2611.28] Does this God love me?
[2611.28 → 2613.28] Does this God love me?
[2613.28 → 2627.28] It says, if you look at your identity, and give you an example of saying to God, anemic learning format of love, that you are forcing us to racist to вже?
[2627.28 → 2631.32] So let's suppose that your friend who asked this question is a new mother,
[2632.06 → 2634.14] and her child has a birth defect.
[2635.26 → 2639.12] And if we use that as evidence for the way God feels towards us,
[2639.12 → 2644.64] we would conclude that either God does not exist, or he doesn't really care about us.
[2645.60 → 2652.60] If you want to answer her question, does God love me, you need to bring along your Bible.
[2653.64 → 2657.12] That's something that Psalm 19 tells us very clearly.
[2657.50 → 2660.72] That nature is not enough to give you what you need most.
[2661.22 → 2664.82] And what you need most is intimate knowledge of God.
[2665.86 → 2670.26] There's only so much that a star can say to you.
[2671.36 → 2675.02] Or if we go back to the painting illustration, a painting may be wonderful,
[2675.60 → 2678.20] but what it tells me about the artist is limited.
[2679.04 → 2684.06] If I wanted to get to know the artist, I would need to read their autobiography,
[2684.06 → 2688.20] or to meet them in person and to talk with them,
[2688.32 → 2690.58] to get to know what they're really like.
[2691.28 → 2697.38] So at the risk of oversimplifying, that is what the Bible claims to be, God's autobiography.
[2698.14 → 2699.88] God has written about himself.
[2699.88 → 2715.52] That's why in verses 7 to 9 of Psalm 19, the focus moves from the world that reveals God to the word.
[2716.32 → 2721.10] And though we struggle to listen, and we are hard of hearing,
[2721.10 → 2726.50] God is speaking to us with words that we need.
[2726.50 → 2729.48] And you know, it's very interesting.
[2730.42 → 2734.80] In verses 1 to 6, it talks about the world that God created.
[2735.58 → 2738.00] The word used for God is Elohim.
[2738.48 → 2741.04] It's kind of a generic word for God.
[2741.90 → 2743.90] It's the word used for God in Genesis 1.
[2744.16 → 2747.16] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[2747.86 → 2748.98] It's kind of less personal.
[2748.98 → 2755.96] But then the word used for God in verses 7 and following is the Lord.
[2756.10 → 2756.78] Did you notice that?
[2756.86 → 2757.46] The Lord.
[2757.60 → 2758.16] The Lord.
[2758.54 → 2759.10] Yahweh.
[2759.60 → 2762.94] The covenant God who wants us to know him personally.
[2763.56 → 2768.30] The God who wants to have a marriage even with you.
[2769.54 → 2773.40] So to move to deeper levels of intimacy, what we need is words.
[2774.74 → 2777.54] And friends, God has not just given us his world,
[2777.54 → 2780.40] but he gives us his very word.
[2781.94 → 2786.44] And so kids, the second key word for this morning, are you ready?
[2786.96 → 2789.46] The second key word is special revelation.
[2790.24 → 2791.36] Special revelation.
[2792.08 → 2797.22] Special revelation is God telling us about himself in the Bible.
[2798.24 → 2798.46] Right?
[2798.54 → 2802.38] In the Bible, God reveals things about himself that we couldn't know
[2802.38 → 2806.40] simply by looking at the frogs in the mountains.
[2806.40 → 2814.42] So what do these words of God, these words of Scripture that we read in our Bibles,
[2814.52 → 2820.88] that we hear read out loud, what does it provide that nature cannot?
[2822.18 → 2823.78] Well, look at these verses.
[2823.92 → 2825.10] Look at the way it's described.
[2825.10 → 2826.10] God's word.
[2826.10 → 2828.20] It makes wise the simple.
[2828.92 → 2831.32] It brings joy to the despairing.
[2831.82 → 2833.68] Light to those in darkness.
[2834.22 → 2835.62] Nourishment to the needy.
[2836.38 → 2838.54] Solid ground to the shaky.
[2839.48 → 2841.08] Direction to the wayward.
[2842.06 → 2843.90] And it is a word of love.
[2845.10 → 2850.32] God's self-disclosure, his opening up himself to you,
[2850.32 → 2854.54] inviting you to know him and to be known by him.
[2855.78 → 2860.32] And that's why the psalm says God's word is more valuable than gold,
[2860.88 → 2866.74] more valuable than wealth and all the savings that we could possibly amass.
[2867.68 → 2871.58] It's more valuable than our dream house or our career.
[2871.58 → 2874.24] It's more valuable than our relationships.
[2875.14 → 2879.30] It's more valuable than our accomplishments, our social status.
[2880.20 → 2881.86] Anything that we could ever attain.
[2883.00 → 2885.28] I love how C.S. Lewis describes it.
[2885.60 → 2886.90] He says this,
[2887.58 → 2890.44] God's word is sweeter than honey.
[2891.42 → 2894.68] And so for my daughter, that would be very exciting.
[2895.14 → 2897.46] Because she's a good baker, I discovered last night.
[2897.46 → 2900.70] But C.S. Lewis says this,
[2900.80 → 2903.28] Or if you don't have a sweet tooth, like me,
[2904.04 → 2904.98] let's just say,
[2905.74 → 2908.72] it's like drinking fresh water from a mountain stream.
[2909.62 → 2913.04] It's like fresh air after being in a dungeon.
[2914.38 → 2918.14] It's like safety and peace after a nightmare.
[2920.70 → 2923.86] And so how are we to listen to God's word?
[2923.86 → 2928.52] I mean, what should be our posture, our attitude,
[2929.12 → 2931.14] as we come to the Bible?
[2932.66 → 2936.00] Well, in verse 12, the psalmist says,
[2936.80 → 2939.20] Who can discern his errors?
[2940.34 → 2942.16] Who can discern his errors?
[2942.26 → 2943.90] And it's a rhetorical question.
[2944.28 → 2945.72] The answer is nobody.
[2946.86 → 2951.56] We are incapable of seeing ourselves for who we are.
[2951.56 → 2955.44] Unless God comes and speaks to us
[2955.44 → 2957.02] and tells us our true condition.
[2958.92 → 2961.24] And you know, Mark Twain, the author,
[2961.56 → 2964.64] he talks about this recurring nightmare that he had.
[2965.26 → 2967.84] Where there's this huge leather Bible.
[2968.36 → 2969.42] And it's big.
[2969.50 → 2970.78] It's bigger than he is.
[2971.42 → 2973.88] And it was kind of weighing down on him
[2973.88 → 2976.36] and pushing him down and crushing him.
[2976.36 → 2979.72] And I think what Mark Twain is expressing
[2979.72 → 2982.34] is that the Bible exposes us.
[2983.30 → 2986.68] It exposes our hidden faults.
[2987.36 → 2989.64] It exposes our sins and our failures.
[2990.12 → 2991.94] And when it does that, it is not pleasant.
[2992.84 → 2994.86] If it is unwelcomed by us,
[2994.88 → 2997.34] it can feel like it's oppressing us.
[2998.16 → 3000.52] But what Psalm 19 says to us
[3000.52 → 3003.06] is that this is not necessarily a bad thing.
[3003.06 → 3005.54] Because verse 11 says,
[3006.46 → 3010.70] By them, by them, by the words of God,
[3011.04 → 3012.52] your servant is warned.
[3013.16 → 3015.22] In keeping them, there is great reward.
[3016.14 → 3018.58] In listening to God's voice,
[3018.84 → 3021.38] obeying his word, let it expose us,
[3021.68 → 3023.38] there is great reward.
[3025.16 → 3027.70] And so, how are we to approach the Bible?
[3028.42 → 3031.10] The fundamental posture we are to have as Christians
[3031.10 → 3032.62] is to sit under the word.
[3033.34 → 3036.34] To let it reveal our hearts and thoughts.
[3036.86 → 3040.20] To, like a sword, pierce us
[3040.20 → 3043.02] and divide soul and spirit, body and soul.
[3043.94 → 3045.40] It exposes us,
[3046.12 → 3047.72] but then it heals us.
[3047.92 → 3049.40] And it makes us whole again.
[3050.84 → 3051.90] And so look at this.
[3052.08 → 3053.68] In verse 12 that we just read,
[3053.78 → 3056.78] David talks about his errors and his faults.
[3056.78 → 3059.56] And then in verse 14,
[3060.28 → 3061.44] he prays this.
[3062.54 → 3065.58] Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[3066.88 → 3068.50] Right, David is,
[3068.94 → 3070.72] he acknowledges his faults.
[3071.06 → 3072.38] Who can discern his faults?
[3072.66 → 3073.08] Nobody.
[3074.30 → 3076.26] My rock and my redeemer.
[3077.00 → 3079.08] He's crying out for a redeemer.
[3079.34 → 3080.52] And who is the redeemer?
[3081.46 → 3083.82] You know the redeemer is the Lord Jesus.
[3083.82 → 3087.06] So the beauty of this psalm for us today
[3087.06 → 3090.54] is that God has spoken in his world,
[3090.72 → 3091.82] in his word,
[3092.12 → 3094.46] but he has spoken in even greater word.
[3095.10 → 3097.04] The apostle John says it like this.
[3097.60 → 3098.00] He says,
[3098.00 → 3100.06] the word who is God.
[3100.58 → 3102.88] The word who was from the beginning,
[3103.02 → 3104.90] who is with God from all eternity.
[3104.90 → 3108.90] The word who spoke all creation into existence,
[3109.22 → 3110.94] who sustains the world,
[3111.50 → 3113.32] the world by the word of his power.
[3113.90 → 3116.78] That word became flesh.
[3117.54 → 3119.46] It became a human being.
[3120.62 → 3121.86] In other words,
[3122.22 → 3123.22] God's works,
[3124.06 → 3126.06] his creation and his word
[3126.06 → 3128.00] have beautifully and mysteriously
[3128.00 → 3130.72] come together fully in Jesus.
[3131.62 → 3132.72] Isn't that amazing?
[3134.04 → 3137.32] Jesus Christ is God's loudest,
[3137.78 → 3138.58] clearest,
[3139.06 → 3140.74] most beautiful word
[3140.74 → 3142.18] to the world.
[3143.18 → 3145.72] And as a man who lived
[3145.72 → 3147.84] in his father's world,
[3148.42 → 3152.48] every single meditation of his heart,
[3152.48 → 3154.66] every word of his mouth
[3154.66 → 3156.94] was pleasing in God's sight.
[3157.88 → 3159.56] And in his perfection,
[3160.06 → 3161.40] he becomes not just
[3161.40 → 3163.52] a role model for us to imitate,
[3163.74 → 3165.24] he becomes our redeemer,
[3166.08 → 3167.58] forgiving our sins
[3167.58 → 3169.92] so that we in him
[3169.92 → 3171.38] would be blameless.
[3172.72 → 3175.74] And so that this nightmare
[3175.74 → 3176.92] that Mark Twain has
[3176.92 → 3178.00] of a Bible crushing us,
[3178.04 → 3178.86] it wouldn't be that,
[3179.08 → 3181.26] but it would be sweeter than honey.
[3181.26 → 3184.20] It would be a fresh mountain spring,
[3184.68 → 3186.58] that it would be music to our ears.
[3189.04 → 3191.70] So God is speaking, friends.
[3191.94 → 3193.28] God is speaking to us
[3193.28 → 3194.48] in his world.
[3195.20 → 3196.22] He is speaking to us
[3196.22 → 3196.96] in his word.
[3197.52 → 3198.40] Are we listening?
[3199.04 → 3200.44] He wants us to know him.
[3200.80 → 3201.66] Are we listening?
[3203.32 → 3204.40] And so that brings us
[3204.40 → 3206.86] to the final point.
[3206.96 → 3208.00] I want to spend a few minutes
[3208.00 → 3208.84] talking about
[3208.84 → 3210.30] what does it look like
[3210.30 → 3211.20] to listen to God?
[3211.76 → 3213.12] What might this mean for us?
[3213.50 → 3214.82] So just three things quickly.
[3216.08 → 3218.50] First, we need to listen to God
[3218.50 → 3219.66] in and through his world.
[3220.64 → 3220.90] Right?
[3221.34 → 3223.02] God loves his creation.
[3223.24 → 3224.86] God said this world is good.
[3225.70 → 3226.90] He cares for everything.
[3228.06 → 3229.34] And he pronounces
[3229.34 → 3230.88] his blessing over it.
[3231.62 → 3233.34] And if for no other reason
[3233.34 → 3233.96] than that,
[3234.30 → 3235.44] Christians should be
[3235.44 → 3236.64] the most passionate
[3236.64 → 3237.78] environmentalists.
[3238.26 → 3240.48] We should have a high view
[3240.48 → 3242.58] of the world around us
[3242.58 → 3244.54] because it is God's world.
[3246.38 → 3248.02] But to listen to God
[3248.02 → 3248.68] in his world,
[3248.78 → 3249.82] we have to slow down.
[3251.22 → 3253.26] We can see the way
[3253.26 → 3254.86] that God is proclaiming
[3254.86 → 3256.86] his glory in the creation.
[3256.86 → 3258.72] So,
[3258.92 → 3260.24] I want to invite you,
[3260.82 → 3262.40] maybe after this worship service,
[3262.60 → 3264.08] to go on a long walk,
[3264.76 → 3266.02] to pay attention
[3266.02 → 3267.48] to God,
[3267.56 → 3268.32] to the beauty
[3268.32 → 3269.64] that surrounds us.
[3269.82 → 3271.16] And we live in a beautiful place
[3271.16 → 3271.84] to do this.
[3272.94 → 3273.12] You know,
[3273.16 → 3274.22] and we shouldn't be surprised
[3274.22 → 3274.70] with that.
[3274.96 → 3275.14] You know,
[3275.14 → 3276.80] when Jesus speaks to the crowd
[3276.80 → 3278.78] about their fear and anxiety,
[3278.88 → 3279.82] and maybe some of us
[3279.82 → 3281.48] are experiencing fear
[3281.48 → 3282.16] and anxiety,
[3282.74 → 3283.62] what does he say
[3283.62 → 3284.46] in Matthew 6?
[3284.46 → 3286.04] He says,
[3286.54 → 3287.62] look and consider
[3287.62 → 3289.36] the birds of the air.
[3290.38 → 3291.24] Look and consider
[3291.24 → 3292.84] the lilies of the field.
[3294.06 → 3296.64] If God so cares for them,
[3296.78 → 3297.48] how much more
[3297.48 → 3298.44] will he care for you?
[3300.58 → 3301.38] Wendell Berry
[3301.38 → 3302.78] is a farmer
[3302.78 → 3303.50] and a poet
[3303.50 → 3304.52] of the Christian life.
[3305.16 → 3305.78] And I want to,
[3305.78 → 3307.86] I want to share a poem
[3307.86 → 3308.82] that he wrote
[3308.82 → 3309.50] entitled
[3309.50 → 3312.02] The Peace of Wild Things.
[3312.34 → 3313.28] So please listen
[3313.28 → 3314.04] to what he says.
[3314.46 → 3322.74] Okay, here it is.
[3325.28 → 3326.50] When despair
[3326.50 → 3327.50] for the world
[3327.50 → 3329.08] grows in me,
[3329.78 → 3331.02] and I wake
[3331.02 → 3331.76] in the night
[3331.76 → 3333.70] at the least sound
[3333.70 → 3334.54] in fear
[3334.54 → 3335.94] of what my life
[3335.94 → 3337.16] and my children's lives
[3337.16 → 3337.68] may be,
[3338.40 → 3339.32] I go
[3339.32 → 3340.92] and lay down
[3340.92 → 3342.22] where the wood drake
[3342.22 → 3342.72] rests
[3342.72 → 3343.50] in his beauty
[3343.50 → 3344.16] on the water
[3344.16 → 3345.90] and the great
[3345.90 → 3347.22] heron feeds.
[3348.50 → 3349.60] I come
[3349.60 → 3350.54] into the peace
[3350.54 → 3351.70] of wild things
[3351.70 → 3353.36] who do not
[3353.36 → 3354.56] tax their lives
[3354.56 → 3355.50] with forethought
[3355.50 → 3356.30] of grief.
[3356.96 → 3357.94] I come
[3357.94 → 3358.78] into the presence
[3358.78 → 3359.78] of still water
[3359.78 → 3361.30] and I feel
[3361.30 → 3361.96] above me
[3361.96 → 3363.38] the day-blind stars
[3363.38 → 3364.78] waiting with their light.
[3365.78 → 3366.88] For a time,
[3366.88 → 3367.64] I rest
[3367.64 → 3368.72] in the grace
[3368.72 → 3369.48] of the world
[3369.48 → 3371.10] and am free.
[3373.26 → 3374.00] I think it's
[3374.00 → 3374.96] a beautiful poem.
[3375.72 → 3376.76] And it tells us
[3376.76 → 3377.76] that not only
[3377.76 → 3379.08] does God call us
[3379.08 → 3380.28] to care for creation,
[3380.98 → 3381.96] but God
[3381.96 → 3384.00] in and through creation
[3384.00 → 3385.22] cares for us.
[3387.02 → 3388.18] So we need to listen
[3388.18 → 3389.74] to God
[3389.74 → 3390.40] speak to us
[3390.40 → 3391.00] in his world.
[3391.00 → 3392.00] And another thing
[3392.00 → 3392.86] I want to highlight
[3392.86 → 3395.06] about what it means
[3395.06 → 3396.04] to be a Christian
[3396.04 → 3398.42] is
[3398.42 → 3399.60] that we need
[3399.60 → 3399.94] to listen
[3399.94 → 3400.78] to God's word
[3400.78 → 3402.16] in the Bible.
[3403.02 → 3404.10] And Psalm 19
[3404.10 → 3405.62] is a renewed
[3405.62 → 3406.16] invitation
[3406.16 → 3406.96] to us
[3406.96 → 3407.42] to listen
[3407.42 → 3408.16] to God's word.
[3409.12 → 3409.90] And if you think
[3409.90 → 3411.10] about any relationship
[3411.10 → 3411.84] you have,
[3412.82 → 3413.54] how do you get
[3413.54 → 3414.34] to know
[3414.34 → 3415.58] that person?
[3416.04 → 3416.64] How do you get
[3416.64 → 3417.52] to really trust
[3417.52 → 3418.16] that person?
[3418.84 → 3419.42] Likely,
[3419.52 → 3419.96] it was through
[3419.96 → 3421.00] listening to them
[3421.00 → 3422.66] share themselves
[3422.66 → 3423.18] with you.
[3423.68 → 3424.60] Listening to them
[3424.60 → 3425.80] kind of open up
[3425.80 → 3426.30] their hearts
[3426.30 → 3427.48] and reveal themselves
[3427.48 → 3428.20] to you.
[3428.70 → 3429.42] And then speaking
[3429.42 → 3430.30] back to them,
[3430.72 → 3431.60] sharing your heart
[3431.60 → 3431.94] with them,
[3432.04 → 3432.72] spending time
[3432.72 → 3433.18] with them.
[3434.44 → 3436.06] And it takes time
[3436.06 → 3436.90] and probably
[3436.90 → 3438.44] sometimes,
[3438.76 → 3439.72] some conversations,
[3440.34 → 3441.32] it would feel
[3441.32 → 3442.12] very mundane
[3442.12 → 3442.92] at times.
[3443.50 → 3444.22] But it's those
[3444.22 → 3445.36] mundane moments
[3445.36 → 3446.26] and conversations
[3446.26 → 3447.52] that build
[3447.52 → 3448.22] the relationship.
[3449.18 → 3449.96] And it's the same
[3449.96 → 3450.72] with our relationship
[3450.72 → 3451.34] with God.
[3452.24 → 3452.60] Christianity
[3452.60 → 3453.98] is about a relationship
[3453.98 → 3454.88] in which you are
[3454.88 → 3456.18] encouraged and invited
[3456.18 → 3458.10] to not remain
[3458.10 → 3459.48] relationally distant,
[3460.14 → 3461.58] but to continue
[3461.58 → 3462.82] on this deepening
[3462.82 → 3463.42] journey
[3463.42 → 3465.14] of knowing God
[3465.14 → 3465.96] and being known.
[3466.90 → 3467.86] And God speaks
[3467.86 → 3468.84] by His Spirit
[3468.84 → 3470.04] through His word,
[3470.62 → 3471.56] inviting us
[3471.56 → 3473.06] into that relationship,
[3473.30 → 3473.84] inviting us
[3473.84 → 3474.66] down that path
[3474.66 → 3475.10] with Him.
[3475.10 → 3477.04] And so really
[3477.04 → 3477.54] simply,
[3478.58 → 3479.56] what might it look
[3479.56 → 3480.58] like for you
[3480.58 → 3481.32] to continue
[3481.32 → 3482.74] to order your days
[3482.74 → 3483.84] where you're going
[3483.84 → 3484.96] to listen to God's word?
[3485.60 → 3486.46] Because friends,
[3486.56 → 3487.46] He is speaking.
[3488.54 → 3489.32] Are you listening?
[3490.08 → 3490.44] And,
[3491.92 → 3492.92] shameless plug,
[3493.40 → 3494.40] but Tuesday night,
[3494.62 → 3495.82] we can do this together.
[3496.46 → 3497.52] Join us on Zoom,
[3497.60 → 3498.02] we're going to be
[3498.02 → 3498.36] kind of doing
[3498.36 → 3499.66] a devotional together,
[3499.96 → 3500.68] looking at the book
[3500.68 → 3501.32] of Habakkuk.
[3501.76 → 3502.68] So that's Tuesday night,
[3502.78 → 3503.26] 730.
[3503.40 → 3503.56] Okay,
[3503.60 → 3504.28] that's like a plug,
[3504.40 → 3506.18] but we can listen
[3506.18 → 3507.04] to God's word together.
[3507.94 → 3508.26] So,
[3508.46 → 3509.14] the last thing
[3509.14 → 3509.78] I want to say
[3509.78 → 3512.52] is this psalm
[3512.52 → 3513.54] is calling us
[3513.54 → 3514.38] to be changed
[3514.38 → 3515.26] and transformed
[3515.26 → 3516.32] by listening
[3516.32 → 3517.04] to God's voice.
[3517.54 → 3518.58] And we see that
[3518.58 → 3519.68] in this last verse.
[3520.98 → 3521.98] He says,
[3522.98 → 3523.74] and I thought
[3523.74 → 3524.44] I had it on the screen,
[3524.54 → 3525.08] but it might have
[3525.08 → 3525.52] gone away.
[3527.32 → 3527.76] Nope,
[3527.96 → 3528.18] okay.
[3528.96 → 3529.74] It says this,
[3529.74 → 3531.46] may these words
[3531.46 → 3532.28] of my mouth
[3532.28 → 3533.82] and this meditation
[3533.82 → 3534.78] of my heart
[3534.78 → 3535.50] be pleasing
[3535.50 → 3536.42] in your sight,
[3537.08 → 3537.48] Lord,
[3537.60 → 3538.10] my rock
[3538.10 → 3538.76] and my redeemer.
[3539.60 → 3540.74] And this last verse
[3540.74 → 3541.30] is really
[3541.30 → 3542.86] the psalmist David
[3542.86 → 3543.46] asking,
[3543.72 → 3543.90] Lord,
[3544.20 → 3545.58] would you help me
[3545.58 → 3547.06] reflect your beauty
[3547.06 → 3547.64] in the way
[3547.64 → 3548.40] that you have created
[3548.40 → 3549.00] me to be?
[3549.78 → 3551.40] Would you restore me?
[3552.18 → 3552.78] Would you help me
[3552.78 → 3553.94] to listen to you
[3553.94 → 3554.94] and make me
[3554.94 → 3555.90] a faithful witness
[3555.90 → 3556.66] to your beauty
[3556.66 → 3557.26] and glory?
[3557.26 → 3558.92] And so,
[3559.08 → 3560.44] let's pray together
[3560.44 → 3561.46] and let's make that
[3561.46 → 3563.06] again our prayer
[3563.06 → 3563.46] together.
[3563.56 → 3564.00] Let's pray.
[3566.80 → 3568.08] May the words
[3568.08 → 3569.80] of our mouths
[3569.80 → 3571.58] and the meditation
[3571.58 → 3573.38] of our hearts
[3573.38 → 3575.26] be pleasing
[3575.26 → 3576.22] in your sight,
[3577.28 → 3578.06] O Lord,
[3578.78 → 3579.66] our rock
[3579.66 → 3581.72] and our redeemer.
[3582.38 → 3584.00] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3584.68 → 3584.98] Amen.
[3584.98 → 3586.72] So please join me
[3586.72 → 3587.46] in singing again.
[3587.46 → 3587.54] Amen.
[3587.54 → 3587.98] Amen.
[3587.98 → 3588.04] Amen.
[3588.04 → 3588.40] Amen.
[3588.40 → 3588.58] Amen.
[3588.58 → 3589.00] Amen.
[3614.98 → 3618.42] We pray in Jesus'I name.
[3618.58 → 3619.74] Amen.
[3620.06 → 3620.78] Amen.
[3620.78 → 3623.62] This is my Father's world
[3623.62 → 3628.66] and to my listening ears
[3628.66 → 3631.62] all nature sings
[3631.62 → 3634.08] and round me rings
[3634.08 → 3638.38] the music of the spirits.
[3638.94 → 3643.38] This is my Father's world
[3643.38 → 3648.34] I rest here in the thought
[3648.34 → 3653.40] Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
[3653.40 → 3658.00] His hands of wonders wide
[3658.00 → 3662.92] This is my Father's world
[3662.92 → 3667.72] The church and the earth's place
[3667.72 → 3672.62] The morning light, the lily-white
[3672.62 → 3677.00] Declare the maker as grace
[3677.00 → 3681.98] This is my Father's world
[3681.98 → 3686.70] He shines in all life's bed
[3686.70 → 3691.90] In a rustling grass I hear Him bounce
[3691.90 → 3695.28] He speaks to me everywhere
[3695.28 → 3701.82] This is my Father's world
[3701.82 → 3706.20] Oh let me not forget
[3706.20 → 3712.08] That though the wrong seems all so strong
[3712.08 → 3716.28] God is the ruler yet
[3716.28 → 3720.20] This is my Father's world
[3720.20 → 3724.58] Why should my heart be sad
[3724.58 → 3728.96] The Lord is King
[3728.96 → 3731.26] And the heavens be
[3731.26 → 3735.34] The praise that hath begun
[3735.34 → 3743.26] So we continue to worship God
[3743.26 → 3745.92] Our Father of this world
[3745.92 → 3747.94] By giving of our offerings
[3747.94 → 3751.34] And our designated offering this week is New Ground
[3751.34 → 3754.38] It's the Diaconal Ministries of Canada
[3754.38 → 3758.04] So the ministry of New Ground is to partner with churches
[3758.76 → 3763.04] To start or grow local community ministries
[3763.04 → 3765.60] To reach out to their neighbours and their cities
[3765.60 → 3770.04] And, so I invite you to continue to worship God
[3770.04 → 3773.12] And support the causes that we as a church
[3773.12 → 3774.40] Love to support
[3774.40 → 3777.42] To help them do the work that God has called them to do
[3777.42 → 3782.52] And so let's now go to the Lord in a community prayer
[3782.52 → 3783.86] Would you please pray with me?
[3783.86 → 3788.86] Psalm 62
[3788.86 → 3790.86] Lord God
[3790.86 → 3794.20] My soul finds rest in you alone
[3794.20 → 3797.32] My salvation comes from you
[3797.32 → 3800.08] You alone are my rock and my salvation
[3800.08 → 3801.90] You are my fortress
[3801.90 → 3803.34] I will never be shaken
[3803.34 → 3807.30] Lord we remind ourselves of these promises
[3807.30 → 3809.16] As we bring our prayers to you
[3809.16 → 3812.14] In this time of COVID-19
[3812.14 → 3814.62] You have shown us a new Lord
[3814.62 → 3816.24] Just how much we need you
[3816.24 → 3820.18] We're used to having control over so many things
[3820.18 → 3821.58] In our lives
[3821.58 → 3824.36] Or at least we thought we had control
[3824.36 → 3829.16] Now we see how little control we actually have
[3829.16 → 3834.90] Please use this time to push us into your presence
[3834.90 → 3838.70] Use this time to show us our weakness
[3838.70 → 3841.10] And our fragility
[3841.10 → 3844.58] We don't like being weak and out of control
[3844.58 → 3846.92] But this is good for us
[3846.92 → 3849.02] Because you promise
[3849.02 → 3851.28] That when we are weak
[3851.28 → 3853.30] You are strong
[3853.30 → 3856.88] You say my grace is sufficient for you
[3856.88 → 3860.28] For my power is made perfect in your weakness
[3860.28 → 3863.28] So Lord we lift to you
[3863.28 → 3865.84] The many places where we need to trust
[3865.84 → 3867.92] That your grace is
[3867.92 → 3869.58] And will be sufficient
[3869.58 → 3873.42] Many of us are facing financial stress
[3873.42 → 3875.72] Our jobs are insecure
[3875.72 → 3877.70] And our finances in jeopardy
[3877.70 → 3880.40] This is a terrifying place to be
[3880.40 → 3883.78] You gently tell us to trust you
[3883.78 → 3885.34] With our needs and our fears
[3885.34 → 3888.28] You say do not be anxious about anything
[3888.28 → 3889.94] But in everything by prayer
[3889.94 → 3892.82] With thanksgiving present your request to me
[3892.82 → 3896.06] And the peace that transcends all understanding
[3896.06 → 3898.64] Will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus
[3898.64 → 3903.44] Lord by faith we trust in you to provide what we need
[3903.44 → 3906.34] Help us to trust you day by day
[3906.34 → 3907.46] And week by week
[3907.46 → 3908.68] Month by month
[3908.68 → 3912.30] Make us wise in our financial decisions
[3912.30 → 3916.02] And give us the humility to ask for help when we need it
[3916.02 → 3919.16] Give us peace in the place of anxiety
[3919.16 → 3922.72] And Lord for those of us who are not financially stressed
[3922.72 → 3925.26] Help us to see the needs of others
[3925.26 → 3926.92] And make us generous
[3926.92 → 3931.04] And remind us that all that we have is yours
[3931.04 → 3934.28] Lord some of us are sick
[3934.28 → 3937.68] Some of us have lost loved ones recently
[3937.68 → 3941.76] And the comfort networks we normally have are not in place
[3941.76 → 3944.78] Some people are sick in hospitals
[3944.78 → 3946.92] Without family or separated
[3946.92 → 3950.42] From us in nursing homes or retirement homes
[3950.42 → 3954.34] Lord you promise that you are close to the broken-hearted
[3954.34 → 3957.82] And you save us when we are crushed in spirit
[3957.82 → 3959.94] Come Lord Jesus
[3959.94 → 3962.48] Help us in our sorrow
[3962.48 → 3964.90] Comfort us in our grief
[3964.90 → 3969.54] We need your presence to be very real in these places
[3969.54 → 3972.38] And so we lift to you now
[3972.38 → 3973.96] Out loud in our homes
[3973.96 → 3976.58] The names of others we know
[3976.58 → 3978.92] Who are sick or sorrowing
[3978.92 → 3980.70] And need your comfort
[3980.70 → 3982.22] And you're healing
[3982.22 → 4004.34] Lord we face very different kinds of challenges
[4004.34 → 4007.34] As we are subject to the stay at home order
[4007.34 → 4009.86] Some of us are lonely
[4009.86 → 4011.88] And the days are long
[4011.88 → 4015.76] The most terrible thing about this is that
[4015.76 → 4017.10] There is no one around us
[4017.10 → 4021.00] For others the challenges come from the other side
[4021.00 → 4022.58] Too many people at home
[4022.58 → 4024.76] No time for solitude
[4024.76 → 4027.52] Conflicts with spouses or children
[4027.52 → 4029.06] Siblings
[4029.06 → 4031.94] Sometimes we don't even know how to pray about these things
[4031.94 → 4034.56] So we say by faith
[4034.56 → 4036.46] I waited patiently for the Lord
[4036.46 → 4039.00] He turned to me and heard my cry
[4039.00 → 4041.30] He lifted me out of the pit
[4041.30 → 4043.62] He set my feet on the rock
[4043.62 → 4045.48] And gave me a firm place to stand
[4045.48 → 4048.16] He put a new song in my mouth
[4048.16 → 4049.94] A hymn of praise to our God
[4049.94 → 4054.24] Blessed are those who make the Lord their trust
[4054.24 → 4058.36] By faith we ask you to comfort
[4058.36 → 4062.80] Guide and help us in exactly the way you know we need
[4062.80 → 4067.02] Lift us out of whatever pits we find ourselves in
[4067.02 → 4069.82] And Lord give us a firm place to stand
[4069.82 → 4074.80] And Lord there are so many decisions that need to be made
[4074.80 → 4077.08] By our leaders in the coming weeks and months
[4077.08 → 4079.52] There's so much uncertainty still
[4079.52 → 4084.06] These decision makers need supernatural wisdom
[4084.06 → 4086.24] And courage to lead us well
[4086.24 → 4088.56] By faith we pray
[4088.56 → 4090.68] Lord you reign over the nations
[4090.68 → 4093.44] You are seated on your holy throne
[4093.44 → 4095.94] Kings of the earth belong to you
[4095.94 → 4100.36] So we pray for our elected officials
[4100.36 → 4103.00] For our health and economic experts
[4103.00 → 4107.34] Who are making decisions about when and how to lift the stay at home orders
[4107.34 → 4109.26] Make them wise
[4109.26 → 4111.46] Give them sound judgment
[4111.46 → 4116.30] We confess that we have much anxiety and fear over the future
[4116.30 → 4119.22] So by faith we affirm your promise
[4119.22 → 4121.52] Again, Lord God
[4121.52 → 4124.94] My soul finds rest in you alone
[4124.94 → 4127.54] My salvation comes from you
[4127.54 → 4131.18] You alone are my rock and my salvation
[4131.18 → 4133.24] You are my fortress
[4133.24 → 4135.90] We will never be shaken
[4135.90 → 4139.36] We pray in Jesus' name
[4139.36 → 4140.64] Amen
[4140.64 → 4148.72] So friends, as we conclude our worship service
[4148.72 → 4150.40] I invite you to hold out your hands
[4150.40 → 4153.10] And receive the blessing of your Heavenly Father
[4153.10 → 4155.64] The Lord bless you and keep you
[4155.64 → 4159.24] The Lord make His face to shine upon you
[4159.24 → 4160.38] And be gracious to you
[4160.38 → 4163.10] The Lord lift His countenance upon you
[4163.10 → 4165.28] And give you His peace
[4165.28 → 4166.76] Now and forever
[4166.76 → 4167.80] Amen
[4167.80 → 4177.64] Amen
[4178.14 → 4179.78] SUPERVISION
[4179.78 → 4180.78] Amen.
[4209.78 → 4210.78] Amen.
[4239.78 → 4241.78] Amen.
[4269.78 → 4271.78] Amen.
[4299.78 → 4301.78] Amen.
