[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.

[214.00 → 216.00] Amen.
[216.00 → 218.00] Amen.
[218.00 → 220.00] Amen.
[220.00 → 222.00] Welcome.
[222.00 → 224.00] Good morning.
[224.00 → 230.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church and our live-streamed worship service.
[230.00 → 239.00] While we are all in different locations, through the gift of technology we can still worship together as part of the body of Christ.
[239.00 → 244.00] Hopefully you will be blessed and encouraged in this worship service.
[244.00 → 261.00] Today participating in our service are Mel, Tony, Bart, Jackie, Jeff, Don, and Doug, myself BEV, and Pastor Gary Rosa, who will be bringing us God's word from 2 Kings.
[261.00 → 270.00] And I want to thank Ashley as well, who works in the background, selecting the music for each service and scheduling our vocalists.
[270.00 → 272.00] Much appreciated.
[272.00 → 280.00] Today is Chaplaincy Sunday in our denomination, and we will be remembering our chaplains in our community prayer.
[280.00 → 286.00] A video from our seafarers' chaplaincy will be posted on our church website this week.
[286.00 → 288.00] Be sure to see it.
[288.00 → 299.00] Our offering today is for Bethesda Christian Association, an organization that supports people with diverse abilities and their families with a wide range of services.
[299.00 → 314.00] From supporting living options, community-based activities, life skills, and summer camps, to employment services and family support, Bethesda empowers people to thrive.
[314.00 → 320.00] Your offerings may be given online or dropped off here at the church.
[320.00 → 322.00] Just two announcements.
[322.00 → 328.00] Justin and Julian wanted to say thank you to our congregation last Sunday, but could not.
[328.00 → 332.00] Julian told us later she was afraid she would begin to cry.
[332.00 → 344.00] Julian and Justin flew to Saskatoon this morning to start a new life with friends from their home country of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[344.00 → 348.00] As I left the house today, I heard John speaking on the phone to Justin.
[348.00 → 355.00] They had already landed in Saskatoon and were probably surprised at all the snow that was there.
[355.00 → 358.00] And huge news.
[358.00 → 364.00] Valid, Benz, and their son will be arriving on December 2nd.
[364.00 → 368.00] This is also a new immigrant family for our church.
[368.00 → 375.00] Benz is the sister of Violet and the daughter of Mustafa and FAO who are here with us today.
[375.00 → 377.00] We are very excited.
[377.00 → 383.00] I think there's two people over there who are pretty excited too to see their daughter and son-in-law and grandson.
[383.00 → 392.00] Valid, Benz, and their son have been living as religious refugees in Turkey since 2017.
[392.00 → 396.00] I would ask you all to stand.
[396.00 → 402.00] Please join me in our call to worship.
[402.00 → 410.00] Gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and blessed by God.
[410.00 → 414.00] We come to worship the one and the Holy God.
[414.00 → 420.00] O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[420.00 → 429.00] Your majesty is the music of the starry skies, and the children of dust, and the same in your ears.
[429.00 → 438.00] In the name of the healer, the provider, and the enabler, let your gratitude and joy be made known.
[438.00 → 444.00] O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[444.00 → 450.00] God's greeting to us this morning is grace, mercy, and peace to you
[450.00 → 455.00] from God the Father and Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[455.00 → 460.00] Please greet one another with a wave or a smile.
[460.00 → 461.00] Well, I guess you can't smile.
[461.00 → 464.00] Anyway, but just greet one another.
[464.00 → 467.78] one another. God has greeted us this morning, and we want to continue our worship service.
[494.00 → 515.38] Come people of the risen King who delights to bring him praise. Come all and tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[515.38 → 534.22] From the shifting shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to him. Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[534.22 → 552.22] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice. One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[552.22 → 574.50] Come those whose joy is morning sun and those weeping through the night. Come those who tell of battles won and those struggling in the fight.
[574.50 → 593.52] For his perfect love will never change and his mercies never cease. But follow us through all our days with a certain hope of peace.
[593.52 → 611.52] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice. One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[611.52 → 633.90] Come young and old from every land, men and women of the faith. Come those with full or empty hands, find the riches of his grace.
[633.90 → 663.88] Come those with full or empty hands, find the truth of his grace.
[663.88 → 693.86] Come those with full or empty hands, find the truth of his grace.
[693.86 → 723.84] Come those with full or empty hands, find the truth of his grace.
[723.86 → 735.40] In our next song, Blessed Be the Lord God Almighty, we express our love for our Heavenly Father as we lift his name in praise.
[736.36 → 741.12] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[753.86 → 755.86] Amen.
[770.20 → 775.96] Father in heaven, how we love you.
[775.96 → 783.46] We lift your name in all the earth.
[783.90 → 788.96] May your kingdom be established in our praises.
[790.96 → 796.26] As your people declare your mighty works.
[796.26 → 810.18] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[810.18 → 825.18] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[825.18 → 831.28] Father of mercy be exalted.
[831.28 → 838.28] May Jesus' name be lifted high.
[838.28 → 845.28] For the sacrifice of love has won my pardon.
[845.28 → 850.28] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[850.28 → 857.28] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[857.28 → 864.28] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[864.28 → 879.28] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[879.28 → 886.28] Lord God Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[886.28 → 889.28] Psalm 63 says,
[889.28 → 891.28] You God are my God.
[891.28 → 894.28] God, earnestly I seek you.
[894.28 → 896.28] I thirst for you.
[896.28 → 897.28] Getting all the same touts are the many others.
[897.28 → 898.28] All shouldn't include Jesus's league.
[898.28 → 899.28] Born and shall all the saints will bless their rivers in all.
[899.28 → 900.28] Pale-n Cha Stop.
[900.28 → 905.28] Knowing Jesus' name may come.
[905.28 → 908.64] and beheld your power and your glory.
[909.32 → 912.04] Because your love is better than life,
[912.04 → 914.52] my lips will glorify you.
[915.30 → 917.96] I will praise you as long as I live,
[918.26 → 921.48] and in your name I will lift my hands.
[922.08 → 923.66] Because you are my help,
[924.16 → 926.88] I sing in the shadow of your wings.
[927.38 → 928.58] I cling to you.
[929.12 → 931.10] Your right hand upholds me.
[931.88 → 934.22] Our next song, Faithful One,
[934.22 → 937.90] also describes these thoughts and feelings.
[937.90 → 939.24] It says,
[939.98 → 943.20] You, Lord, are my rock in times of trouble.
[943.64 → 946.48] You lift me up when I fall down.
[947.08 → 948.62] Your love is the anchor.
[949.24 → 951.52] My hope is in you alone.
[964.22 → 986.20] Faithful One, so unchanging.
[986.20 → 997.96] You, Lord, are my rock of peace.
[997.96 → 1005.96] Lord of all, I depend on you.
[1007.96 → 1015.64] I call out to you again and again.
[1015.64 → 1024.64] I call out to you again and again.
[1024.64 → 1033.94] You are my rock in times of trouble.
[1033.94 → 1043.94] You lift me up when I fall down.
[1043.94 → 1047.94] All through the storm,
[1047.94 → 1054.94] Your love is the anchor.
[1054.94 → 1061.94] My hope is in you alone.
[1061.94 → 1091.92] You, Lord, are my rock of peace.
[1091.92 → 1102.08] I call out to you again and again
[1102.08 → 1111.04] I call out to you again and again
[1111.04 → 1120.14] You are my rock in times of trouble
[1120.14 → 1130.02] You lift me up when I fall down
[1130.02 → 1141.40] All through the storm your love is the anchor
[1141.40 → 1148.52] My hope is in you alone
[1148.52 → 1162.34] Please join me in this prayer of confession
[1162.34 → 1169.18] Lord, we are weary
[1169.18 → 1172.22] We are weary of being alone
[1172.22 → 1174.98] We are weary of this pandemic
[1174.98 → 1178.80] We are weary of strife and discord
[1178.80 → 1184.84] We long for fellowship, for togetherness, for wholeness
[1184.84 → 1194.28] Lord, we are shallow
[1194.28 → 1196.76] We are caught up in our daily lives
[1196.76 → 1200.32] Petty differences, disappointments with each other
[1200.32 → 1205.08] We long for purpose, for harmony, for self-worth
[1205.08 → 1214.06] Lord, we are selfish
[1214.06 → 1220.30] We look to material goods, to busyness, to social media to meet our needs
[1220.30 → 1224.14] We long for fulfillment and belonging
[1224.14 → 1235.08] Lord, we are too self-reliant
[1235.08 → 1240.76] In our pride, we want to rely on ourselves for a rich and full life
[1240.76 → 1245.66] Trusting in our own ways, our own opinions, our own guidance
[1245.66 → 1247.90] We think we know best
[1247.90 → 1250.32] We long for direction
[1250.32 → 1253.08] But don't know where to look for it
[1253.08 → 1259.68] How about us to long for you, the morning star, the word of our life
[1259.68 → 1262.76] In the words of St. Augustine
[1262.76 → 1265.94] You have made us for yourself, O Lord
[1265.94 → 1270.56] And our hearts are restless until they rest in you
[1270.56 → 1273.34] Lord, hear our confession
[1273.34 → 1276.26] Fulfill our deepest longings
[1276.26 → 1278.76] And wash our sins from us
[1278.76 → 1283.32] Be our high priest, the light of the world
[1283.32 → 1284.60] Amen
[1284.60 → 1288.44] Here are these words of assurance
[1288.44 → 1291.92] Here are words you may trust
[1291.92 → 1294.44] Words that merit full acceptance
[1294.44 → 1298.30] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners
[1298.30 → 1302.90] To all who confess their sins and resolve to lead a new life
[1302.90 → 1305.10] He says your sins are forgiven
[1305.10 → 1308.36] He also says follow me
[1308.36 → 1311.84] Now to the one who rules all worlds
[1311.84 → 1314.88] Immortal, invisible, the only God
[1314.88 → 1318.42] Be honour and glory forever and ever
[1318.42 → 1319.56] Amen
[1338.36 → 1348.06] My soul longs for the Lord
[1348.06 → 1352.00] In a weary land
[1352.00 → 1356.58] Grounds are dry, and I am empty
[1356.58 → 1360.94] Only dust in my hands
[1360.94 → 1365.28] How I yearn for streams of mercy
[1365.28 → 1369.76] Where my soul can be restored
[1369.76 → 1371.80] Come and pray
[1371.80 → 1375.20] Jesus calls me
[1375.20 → 1379.24] And you will thirst no more
[1379.24 → 1383.90] Oh the fullness of Christ
[1383.90 → 1389.24] Word of God, word of life
[1389.24 → 1396.90] Living Word, you walked among us
[1396.90 → 1400.00] Our Emmanuel
[1400.00 → 1405.66] And you spoke into the darkness
[1405.66 → 1409.98] From the powers of hell
[1409.98 → 1414.72] Grace and mercy float from Calvary
[1414.72 → 1419.50] To the valley of our need
[1419.50 → 1424.24] It is done, it is finished
[1424.24 → 1428.10] From every sin set free
[1428.10 → 1432.92] Oh the victory of Christ
[1432.92 → 1438.72] Word of God, word of life
[1438.72 → 1446.54] My soul longs to walk closer
[1446.54 → 1450.94] With the Lord I serve
[1450.94 → 1455.50] More than riches, more than favour
[1455.50 → 1460.08] I delight in your word
[1460.08 → 1464.64] Turn my gaze from all that's worthless
[1464.64 → 1469.12] Set my heart on things above
[1469.12 → 1473.56] May my life tell your goodness
[1473.56 → 1478.20] Your way of truth and love
[1478.20 → 1482.88] Oh the wisdom of Christ
[1482.88 → 1488.60] Word of God, word of life
[1488.60 → 1495.08] My soul longs for the day
[1495.08 → 1499.52] I will see your face
[1499.52 → 1503.92] Hear your shout of jubilation
[1503.92 → 1508.64] No more tears, death or pain
[1508.64 → 1513.42] Every word at last accomplished
[1513.42 → 1517.98] Heaven sings and earth replies
[1517.98 → 1522.62] To our God be the glory
[1522.62 → 1527.16] Land of creation and pride
[1527.16 → 1531.96] Praise and honour to Christ
[1531.96 → 1538.48] Word of God, word of life
[1538.48 → 1547.70] Although he really doesn't need a lot of introduction
[1547.70 → 1550.80] We do want to welcome Pastor Gary Rosema
[1550.80 → 1552.22] To our pulpit today
[1552.22 → 1555.66] Pastor Gary is the seafarers' chaplain
[1555.66 → 1556.88] For the Vancouver area
[1556.88 → 1558.80] And today is Chaplaincy Sunday
[1558.80 → 1560.92] He was a missionary
[1560.92 → 1562.48] He's actually still a missionary
[1562.48 → 1564.80] He was a former associate pastor
[1564.80 → 1566.04] Here in this church
[1566.04 → 1567.88] And we treasure those days
[1567.88 → 1569.04] That he and his family
[1569.04 → 1570.16] Were here among us
[1570.16 → 1573.10] Before Pastor Gary comes forward
[1573.10 → 1574.60] I'd like to offer a prayer
[1574.60 → 1575.66] For illumination
[1575.66 → 1577.80] Let us pray
[1577.80 → 1584.36] Oh God, open our hearts and minds
[1584.36 → 1586.48] By the power of your Holy Spirit
[1586.48 → 1589.06] That as the scriptures are read
[1589.06 → 1590.56] And your word is proclaimed
[1590.56 → 1593.22] May we hear what you are saying
[1593.22 → 1594.54] To us today
[1594.54 → 1595.82] Amen
[1595.82 → 1611.16] Well good morning again
[1611.16 → 1613.26] It's good to be back with you
[1613.26 → 1614.62] Again, yes
[1614.62 → 1616.16] And we treasure those days
[1616.16 → 1618.08] I forgot to mention last week
[1618.08 → 1619.52] How did I ever forget
[1619.52 → 1623.56] That our middle son, Tim
[1623.56 → 1625.28] Some of you may remember Tim
[1625.28 → 1626.02] Tall Tim
[1626.02 → 1627.94] Who was actually born
[1627.94 → 1629.68] While we were here earlier on
[1629.68 → 1631.28] And baptized in this church
[1631.28 → 1634.36] Tim was engaged recently
[1634.36 → 1636.34] And is getting married in January
[1636.34 → 1638.82] And so we're really excited about that
[1638.82 → 1640.72] It's going to be an interesting wedding
[1640.72 → 1641.44] I'm involved
[1641.44 → 1644.74] But it's still
[1644.74 → 1646.20] We're really happy for that
[1646.20 → 1647.78] So, yeah, thanks
[1647.78 → 1649.16] I was going to say too
[1649.16 → 1650.72] In terms of that video
[1650.72 → 1651.68] We were hoping to show it
[1651.68 → 1653.08] But there were some sound issues
[1653.08 → 1654.12] So do
[1654.12 → 1655.02] I would encourage you
[1655.02 → 1656.36] To see that chaplaincy video
[1656.36 → 1657.60] It's something that we put together
[1657.60 → 1660.00] With the chaplaincy
[1660.00 → 1661.96] The Ministry of Seafarers in Montreal
[1661.96 → 1663.54] They kind of put it all together
[1663.54 → 1666.84] And they allowed me to be part of that
[1666.84 → 1670.10] And one of the things I share on that video
[1670.10 → 1672.22] Is the main thing for chaplaincy
[1672.22 → 1673.04] For me sort of
[1673.04 → 1677.16] Is this whole aspect of being a chaplain
[1677.16 → 1679.08] And learning to listen
[1679.08 → 1681.94] To really listen to people
[1681.94 → 1682.64] Rather than
[1682.64 → 1685.26] I mean, you know, I talk up here a lot
[1685.26 → 1687.02] So I kind of like talking
[1687.02 → 1688.26] I like teaching and preaching
[1688.26 → 1688.92] And that kind of thing
[1688.92 → 1690.92] So learning to listen
[1690.92 → 1692.52] Before speaking
[1692.52 → 1694.98] Has been really something I've had to learn
[1694.98 → 1696.26] And just on Friday
[1696.26 → 1700.14] I was on a ship here in downtown
[1700.14 → 1701.74] And I went on board
[1701.74 → 1703.86] And I began chatting with the
[1703.86 → 1705.48] It was a Filipino sailor
[1705.48 → 1706.48] Right at the gangway
[1706.48 → 1707.72] And we were talking
[1707.72 → 1709.36] And again, it's one of those things
[1709.36 → 1711.92] I could have just kind of launched into my sermon
[1711.92 → 1714.44] And I wouldn't have done the one today
[1714.44 → 1715.62] But, you know, a sermon
[1715.62 → 1716.98] Something like that
[1716.98 → 1718.00] And I
[1718.00 → 1720.16] But I started chatting
[1720.16 → 1720.86] I was just
[1720.86 → 1722.66] I tell myself consciously
[1722.66 → 1723.72] Listen, listen, listen
[1723.72 → 1724.68] So I asked questions
[1724.68 → 1725.56] I asked questions
[1725.56 → 1726.12] I kept going
[1726.12 → 1726.86] How's it going?
[1727.34 → 1728.20] Yeah, we're all good
[1728.20 → 1730.88] And when are you getting off the ship?
[1731.08 → 1732.00] And how's your contract?
[1732.30 → 1733.32] And when are you signing off?
[1733.34 → 1734.00] And all this stuff
[1734.00 → 1736.26] And it took a while
[1736.26 → 1738.68] Because they're not always as forthcoming
[1738.68 → 1739.76] As we might be
[1739.76 → 1742.52] But eventually he said to me
[1742.52 → 1745.20] But I got news this week
[1745.20 → 1747.12] And he said
[1747.12 → 1748.64] You heard about that typhoon
[1748.64 → 1750.34] That just slammed through
[1750.34 → 1751.08] Just like
[1751.08 → 1752.60] It was like the day before
[1752.60 → 1753.60] He said
[1753.60 → 1755.30] My family home
[1755.30 → 1756.64] Was flooded
[1756.64 → 1758.74] Up into the second floor
[1758.74 → 1759.58] He said
[1759.58 → 1760.30] We lost
[1760.30 → 1761.78] Almost everything
[1761.78 → 1763.28] And
[1763.28 → 1764.28] I just thought
[1764.28 → 1764.84] Wow
[1764.84 → 1767.50] What an incredible
[1767.50 → 1768.40] Unbelievable
[1768.40 → 1769.68] Tragic
[1769.68 → 1770.52] Story
[1770.52 → 1772.60] And the decision
[1772.60 → 1773.82] This guy is faced with
[1773.82 → 1773.96] Now
[1773.96 → 1775.10] Because he's nearing
[1775.10 → 1776.78] The end of his contract
[1776.78 → 1778.12] He could go home
[1778.12 → 1778.94] In South Korea
[1778.94 → 1779.46] He says
[1779.46 → 1780.50] When they get
[1780.50 → 1781.68] Where they're going next
[1781.68 → 1782.32] But he said
[1782.32 → 1784.98] I need to make some money
[1784.98 → 1785.88] To kind of
[1785.88 → 1787.46] Recover a little bit
[1787.46 → 1788.28] Recuperate
[1788.28 → 1788.92] So
[1788.92 → 1790.34] Should I sign off
[1790.34 → 1791.78] And go home for Christmas
[1791.78 → 1792.78] And be with my family
[1792.78 → 1793.62] And fortunately
[1793.62 → 1794.42] In that culture
[1794.42 → 1794.78] Of course
[1794.78 → 1795.36] Family
[1795.36 → 1796.54] Pitches in
[1796.54 → 1797.30] They're close
[1797.30 → 1797.94] A bit more
[1797.94 → 1798.34] Probably
[1798.34 → 1798.94] In community
[1798.94 → 1799.96] So there is some
[1799.96 → 1801.80] Significant family support
[1801.80 → 1802.34] But still
[1802.34 → 1803.50] What a decision
[1803.50 → 1804.18] To have to make
[1804.18 → 1805.30] Or should I stay on
[1805.30 → 1806.80] Make a bit more money
[1806.80 → 1807.82] So that we can
[1807.82 → 1808.70] Actually recover
[1808.70 → 1811.36] And
[1811.36 → 1812.06] You know
[1812.06 → 1812.56] For me
[1812.56 → 1813.42] And of course
[1813.42 → 1813.96] It's a balance
[1813.96 → 1814.60] In chaplaincy
[1814.60 → 1815.74] To know when to
[1815.74 → 1816.58] And I'm still learning
[1816.58 → 1817.94] To know when to listen
[1817.94 → 1818.70] And when to
[1818.70 → 1820.00] When to speak
[1820.00 → 1820.90] And so of course
[1820.90 → 1822.28] I shared with him
[1822.28 → 1823.44] And prayed with him
[1823.44 → 1824.94] But what a story
[1824.94 → 1826.06] And these stories
[1826.06 → 1826.80] Are happening over
[1826.80 → 1827.46] And over again
[1827.46 → 1829.24] For a lot of these guys
[1829.24 → 1831.24] And in many situations
[1831.24 → 1832.48] But that's a little hint
[1832.48 → 1833.46] A little insight
[1833.46 → 1834.58] Into what chaplaincy
[1834.58 → 1836.30] Is sort of about
[1836.30 → 1838.88] Turning now
[1838.88 → 1841.16] To 2 Kings
[1841.16 → 1842.40] Chapter 2
[1842.40 → 1847.22] An unusual story
[1847.22 → 1848.22] That we're going to have
[1848.22 → 1849.30] To tackle through
[1849.30 → 1850.04] As I'm just kind of
[1850.04 → 1851.38] Working through these stories
[1851.38 → 1852.62] It's one kind of
[1852.62 → 1853.32] You know
[1853.32 → 1854.60] Might have been easier
[1854.60 → 1855.20] To just
[1855.20 → 1856.64] Let's just skip that one
[1856.64 → 1857.76] And go to the next story
[1857.76 → 1858.20] But
[1858.20 → 1860.38] I was challenged
[1860.38 → 1861.06] To
[1861.06 → 1862.66] To look at this
[1862.66 → 1863.38] And to examine
[1863.38 → 1863.92] What's
[1863.92 → 1865.02] What's happening here
[1865.02 → 1865.88] So
[1865.88 → 1867.72] Reading from
[1867.72 → 1868.56] 2 Kings
[1868.56 → 1869.58] Chapter 2
[1869.58 → 1870.24] Beginning at
[1870.24 → 1870.66] Verse
[1870.66 → 1871.74] 23
[1871.74 → 1872.10] Remember
[1872.10 → 1873.04] Last time
[1873.04 → 1874.22] He was in Jericho
[1874.22 → 1875.78] The healing of the waters
[1875.78 → 1876.10] There
[1876.10 → 1876.96] And now
[1876.96 → 1878.78] Another little vignette
[1878.78 → 1879.60] Comes along
[1879.60 → 1881.34] 2 Kings 2
[1881.34 → 1881.76] Beginning at
[1881.76 → 1882.38] Verse 23
[1882.38 → 1883.08] From there
[1883.08 → 1885.00] Elisha went up
[1885.00 → 1885.72] To Bethel
[1885.72 → 1888.24] As he was walking
[1888.24 → 1889.24] Along the road
[1889.24 → 1890.80] Some boys came
[1890.80 → 1891.80] Out of the town
[1891.80 → 1893.48] And jeered at him
[1893.48 → 1894.90] Get out of here
[1894.90 → 1895.66] Baldy
[1895.66 → 1896.80] They said
[1896.80 → 1897.82] Get out of here
[1897.82 → 1898.64] Baldy
[1898.64 → 1901.68] He turned around
[1901.68 → 1903.70] Looked at them
[1903.70 → 1905.36] And called down
[1905.36 → 1906.78] A curse on them
[1906.78 → 1908.08] In the name of the Lord
[1908.08 → 1910.54] Then two bears
[1910.54 → 1911.60] Came out of the woods
[1911.60 → 1912.52] And mauled
[1912.52 → 1913.60] Forty-two
[1913.60 → 1914.64] Of the boys
[1914.64 → 1917.06] And he went on
[1917.06 → 1917.82] To Mount Carmel
[1917.82 → 1919.22] And from there
[1919.22 → 1920.10] Returned
[1920.10 → 1921.36] To Samaria
[1921.36 → 1925.08] Well
[1925.08 → 1926.06] What do you do
[1926.06 → 1926.80] With a text
[1926.80 → 1927.88] Like this
[1927.88 → 1929.68] You know
[1929.68 → 1930.26] Last week
[1930.26 → 1930.98] Was kind of nice
[1930.98 → 1931.54] Wasn't it
[1931.54 → 1932.92] It was a happy
[1932.92 → 1933.54] Story
[1933.54 → 1933.94] Of
[1933.94 → 1935.28] Healing
[1935.28 → 1936.00] And people
[1936.00 → 1937.66] Turning to the Lord
[1937.66 → 1938.04] And
[1938.04 → 1939.32] Seeking him
[1939.32 → 1939.86] And God
[1939.86 → 1941.14] Bringing his blessing
[1941.14 → 1941.88] His healing
[1941.88 → 1942.80] To the waters
[1942.80 → 1945.82] What happened
[1945.82 → 1949.62] Elisha seems
[1949.62 → 1950.02] To have
[1950.02 → 1951.08] Turned into
[1951.08 → 1951.58] This
[1951.58 → 1952.52] Benoit
[1952.52 → 1953.48] Old
[1953.48 → 1954.50] Grump
[1954.50 → 1956.88] Did he have
[1956.88 → 1957.74] A bad day
[1957.74 → 1959.22] Was it just
[1959.22 → 1960.14] A bad journey
[1960.14 → 1960.84] On his way
[1960.84 → 1962.08] Up to Bethel
[1962.08 → 1962.70] And something
[1962.70 → 1963.72] Set him off
[1963.72 → 1963.92] And
[1963.92 → 1965.56] Wow
[1965.56 → 1968.10] I mean
[1968.10 → 1969.22] Let's be honest
[1969.22 → 1970.12] There's a few
[1970.12 → 1971.00] Of us here
[1971.00 → 1971.90] Who might be
[1971.90 → 1972.36] A bit
[1972.36 → 1975.20] Taken back
[1975.20 → 1976.22] By what he said
[1976.22 → 1977.22] And a bit
[1977.22 → 1977.86] Offended
[1977.86 → 1978.84] Baldy
[1978.84 → 1982.30] I was a kid
[1982.30 → 1982.88] My dad
[1982.88 → 1984.20] Was pretty bald
[1984.20 → 1985.38] Most of
[1985.38 → 1986.10] The time
[1986.10 → 1986.74] I knew him
[1986.74 → 1987.70] And
[1987.70 → 1989.06] We used to
[1989.06 → 1990.04] Tease my dad
[1990.04 → 1991.02] A bit about that
[1991.02 → 1992.88] I'm lucky
[1992.88 → 1993.78] To be alive
[1993.78 → 1999.06] What's going on
[1999.06 → 1999.42] Here
[1999.42 → 2001.10] How did this
[2001.10 → 2002.90] What's happening
[2002.90 → 2003.20] Here
[2003.20 → 2003.92] Underneath
[2003.92 → 2004.44] This story
[2004.44 → 2005.24] And this is
[2005.24 → 2005.58] Where it's
[2005.58 → 2006.16] Important
[2006.16 → 2007.94] In the
[2007.94 → 2008.22] Biblical
[2008.22 → 2008.72] Story
[2008.72 → 2009.76] To always
[2009.76 → 2010.78] Dig deeper
[2010.78 → 2012.56] Because there's
[2012.56 → 2013.06] Always
[2013.06 → 2013.86] Something
[2013.86 → 2014.76] Else
[2014.76 → 2015.80] Going on
[2015.80 → 2017.20] Rather than
[2017.20 → 2017.78] Just the
[2017.78 → 2018.70] Superficial reading
[2018.70 → 2019.12] But you can
[2019.12 → 2019.68] Understand how
[2019.68 → 2020.18] This story
[2020.18 → 2020.96] Has turned
[2020.96 → 2021.46] Off
[2021.46 → 2022.56] Multitudes
[2022.56 → 2023.06] Of people
[2023.06 → 2024.14] What a
[2024.14 → 2024.92] Bloodthirsty
[2024.92 → 2025.42] God
[2025.42 → 2029.08] Calling down
[2029.08 → 2029.88] Curses
[2029.88 → 2031.14] On innocent
[2031.14 → 2031.70] Little
[2031.70 → 2032.38] Kids
[2032.38 → 2034.86] Well what is
[2034.86 → 2035.50] Going on
[2035.50 → 2036.14] And, so I want to
[2036.14 → 2036.76] Look at the story
[2036.76 → 2037.14] With you
[2037.14 → 2038.02] A little bit
[2038.02 → 2039.22] And in depth
[2039.22 → 2040.16] To really
[2040.16 → 2041.04] Understand what's
[2041.04 → 2041.74] Going on here
[2041.74 → 2042.96] First
[2042.96 → 2044.18] Where are they
[2044.18 → 2044.56] Going
[2044.56 → 2046.26] They're going
[2046.26 → 2046.94] To Bethel
[2046.94 → 2048.44] Bethel
[2048.44 → 2049.30] Literally means
[2049.30 → 2050.04] House of
[2050.04 → 2050.48] God
[2050.48 → 2053.86] And it's
[2053.86 → 2054.64] The place
[2054.64 → 2055.00] If you
[2055.00 → 2055.48] If you look
[2055.48 → 2056.08] Through your
[2056.08 → 2056.54] Old Testament
[2056.54 → 2057.18] There's a lot
[2057.18 → 2057.58] Of history
[2057.58 → 2058.12] Of Bethel
[2058.12 → 2058.96] Abraham
[2058.96 → 2060.04] Is at
[2060.04 → 2060.48] Bethel
[2060.48 → 2061.34] This is the
[2061.34 → 2062.12] Place where
[2062.12 → 2062.80] Jacob
[2062.80 → 2063.62] Had that
[2063.62 → 2064.22] Famous
[2064.22 → 2064.88] Dream
[2064.88 → 2065.38] You remember
[2065.38 → 2066.16] With the ladder
[2066.16 → 2066.92] Going up to
[2066.92 → 2067.22] Heaven
[2067.22 → 2068.24] And angels
[2068.24 → 2068.80] Ascending
[2068.80 → 2069.38] And descending
[2069.38 → 2070.28] And this is
[2070.28 → 2071.14] Where he dreamed
[2071.14 → 2071.58] That and
[2071.58 → 2072.06] And they
[2072.06 → 2072.66] Continue to
[2072.66 → 2073.30] Come back
[2073.30 → 2074.44] To Bethel
[2074.44 → 2075.08] It's a place
[2075.08 → 2076.84] Of the altar
[2076.84 → 2077.54] Of the Lord
[2077.54 → 2078.16] They worship
[2078.16 → 2078.68] The Lord
[2078.68 → 2079.58] At this place
[2079.58 → 2082.04] But
[2082.04 → 2082.64] Bethel
[2082.64 → 2083.46] Took a bad
[2083.46 → 2084.02] Turn
[2084.02 → 2084.78] When
[2084.78 → 2086.10] Israel
[2086.10 → 2087.68] The whole
[2087.68 → 2088.10] Nation
[2088.10 → 2088.82] Was divided
[2088.82 → 2089.72] Into Judah
[2089.72 → 2090.58] In the south
[2090.58 → 2091.38] And Israel
[2091.38 → 2092.18] In the north
[2092.18 → 2093.44] And when
[2093.44 → 2095.00] That happened
[2095.00 → 2096.08] Jeroboam
[2096.08 → 2097.06] The initial
[2097.06 → 2098.00] First king
[2098.00 → 2098.82] Of the divided
[2098.82 → 2100.04] Northern kingdom
[2100.04 → 2101.98] Jeroboam
[2101.98 → 2102.86] Set up
[2102.86 → 2103.58] Two
[2103.58 → 2105.16] Gods
[2105.16 → 2107.04] Golden
[2107.04 → 2107.78] Calves
[2107.78 → 2108.18] Of all
[2108.18 → 2108.62] Things
[2108.62 → 2110.62] In the far
[2110.62 → 2111.08] North
[2111.08 → 2111.94] In Dan
[2111.94 → 2113.36] And in the
[2113.36 → 2113.86] South
[2113.86 → 2114.94] In Bethel
[2114.94 → 2116.96] These were
[2116.96 → 2117.60] Meant to be
[2117.60 → 2118.04] Gods
[2118.04 → 2119.06] To compete
[2119.06 → 2119.80] With
[2119.80 → 2120.88] The temple
[2120.88 → 2121.98] In Jerusalem
[2121.98 → 2122.92] Where they
[2122.92 → 2123.38] Worship the
[2123.38 → 2123.78] Lord God
[2123.78 → 2124.28] So the people
[2124.28 → 2124.90] Wouldn't go
[2124.90 → 2125.50] There so that
[2125.50 → 2126.08] The people of
[2126.08 → 2126.62] Israel would
[2126.62 → 2127.48] Stay in
[2127.48 → 2128.06] Israel
[2128.06 → 2130.94] And the
[2130.94 → 2131.54] Centre
[2131.54 → 2132.16] Really of
[2132.16 → 2132.78] The worship
[2132.78 → 2134.36] For
[2134.36 → 2135.18] Israel
[2135.18 → 2136.04] And it
[2136.04 → 2136.40] Became
[2136.40 → 2136.92] Very much
[2136.92 → 2137.66] Focused on
[2137.66 → 2138.30] Baal
[2138.30 → 2139.02] Or Baal
[2139.02 → 2140.60] Was at
[2140.60 → 2141.64] Bethel
[2141.64 → 2142.26] Of all
[2142.26 → 2142.86] Places
[2142.86 → 2145.04] And so
[2145.04 → 2145.46] You have to
[2145.46 → 2145.66] Think
[2145.66 → 2146.22] Remember
[2146.22 → 2146.72] Right away
[2146.72 → 2147.14] When
[2147.14 → 2147.88] Elisha
[2147.88 → 2148.56] Is going
[2148.56 → 2148.84] To
[2148.84 → 2149.36] Bethel
[2149.36 → 2149.96] He is
[2149.96 → 2150.48] Not
[2150.48 → 2151.10] Going
[2151.10 → 2151.74] Into
[2151.74 → 2152.30] Neutral
[2152.30 → 2153.14] Territory
[2153.14 → 2156.74] So we're
[2156.74 → 2157.20] Told
[2157.20 → 2158.50] He's going
[2158.50 → 2158.94] There
[2158.94 → 2159.82] And some
[2159.82 → 2160.70] Boys
[2160.70 → 2161.54] Come along
[2161.54 → 2162.18] The
[2162.18 → 2163.12] Hebrew text
[2163.12 → 2163.84] Literally
[2163.84 → 2164.34] Says
[2164.34 → 2165.12] Little
[2165.12 → 2166.00] Boys
[2166.00 → 2167.54] And then
[2167.54 → 2168.38] Later on
[2168.38 → 2169.36] In verse
[2169.36 → 2170.16] 21
[2170.16 → 2171.02] Sorry
[2171.02 → 2171.50] In verse
[2171.50 → 2172.58] 24
[2172.58 → 2174.28] And it
[2174.28 → 2174.52] Says
[2174.52 → 2174.98] The bears
[2174.98 → 2175.34] Came out
[2175.34 → 2175.74] And mauled
[2175.74 → 2176.68] 42 of
[2176.68 → 2176.90] The
[2176.90 → 2177.32] It's a
[2177.32 → 2177.78] Different term
[2177.78 → 2178.12] In Hebrew
[2178.12 → 2178.64] Of the
[2178.64 → 2179.52] Youths
[2179.52 → 2180.12] The

[2183.10 → 2183.86] And
[2183.86 → 2184.84] Youths
[2184.84 → 2185.80] And often
[2185.80 → 2186.78] It's sort of
[2186.78 → 2187.70] Pejoratively
[2187.70 → 2188.70] Pictured here
[2188.70 → 2189.96] As a
[2189.96 → 2190.50] Sort of

[2194.28 → 2194.70] In a bad
[2194.70 → 2194.96] Mood
[2194.96 → 2195.98] And boom
[2195.98 → 2196.50] You know
[2196.50 → 2196.80] This
[2196.80 → 2197.88] Well
[2197.88 → 2199.12] That's not
[2199.12 → 2200.00] Exactly the
[2200.00 → 2200.40] Way it
[2200.40 → 2200.96] Goes
[2200.96 → 2203.56] The term
[2203.56 → 2204.44] Little
[2204.44 → 2205.16] Boys
[2205.16 → 2206.08] That's used
[2206.08 → 2206.36] Here
[2206.36 → 2207.58] Of these
[2207.58 → 2208.80] This group
[2208.80 → 2209.86] That comes
[2209.86 → 2210.24] Along
[2210.24 → 2212.06] It's the
[2212.06 → 2212.96] Same term
[2212.96 → 2214.32] That's used
[2214.32 → 2215.18] In first

[2221.24 → 2221.86] Solomon
[2221.86 → 2223.42] Goes
[2223.42 → 2224.62] And worships
[2224.62 → 2225.02] The Lord
[2225.02 → 2225.52] And he has
[2225.52 → 2226.40] That dream
[2226.40 → 2226.78] Do you
[2226.78 → 2227.12] Remember
[2227.12 → 2228.24] God says
[2228.24 → 2228.70] What would

[2228.98 → 2229.40] Me give
[2229.40 → 2229.70] You
[2229.70 → 2231.62] And he
[2231.62 → 2232.52] Chooses
[2232.52 → 2233.72] Wisdom
[2233.72 → 2236.08] Rather than
[2236.08 → 2236.54] Wealth
[2236.54 → 2237.50] And all
[2237.50 → 2237.86] The other
[2237.86 → 2238.72] Good stuff
[2238.72 → 2239.44] Long life
[2239.44 → 2239.74] And all
[2239.74 → 2239.98] That
[2239.98 → 2240.24] But he
[2240.24 → 2240.62] Chooses
[2240.62 → 2241.06] Wisdom
[2241.06 → 2241.42] And God
[2241.42 → 2242.06] Please
[2242.06 → 2242.66] But he
[2242.66 → 2243.08] Chooses
[2243.08 → 2243.54] Wisdom
[2243.54 → 2244.00] He says
[2244.00 → 2245.20] Because I
[2245.20 → 2245.92] Am but
[2245.92 → 2247.14] A little
[2247.14 → 2247.86] Boy
[2247.86 → 2250.28] This is
[2250.28 → 2251.10] King Solomon
[2251.10 → 2253.10] But he
[2253.10 → 2254.02] Pictures himself

[2258.60 → 2259.50] In first
[2259.50 → 2260.22] Kings
[2260.22 → 2260.88] Eleven
[2260.88 → 2262.40] When there
[2262.40 → 2263.54] This opposition
[2263.54 → 2264.18] Comes at
[2264.18 → 2264.58] This point
[2264.58 → 2265.34] Solomon has
[2265.34 → 2266.24] Is turning
[2266.24 → 2266.76] Away
[2266.76 → 2267.50] From a

[2268.48 → 2268.82] Total
[2268.82 → 2269.32] Commitment
[2269.32 → 2269.66] To the

[2270.56 → 2271.30] Opposition
[2271.30 → 2271.94] Is raised
[2271.94 → 2272.40] And one
[2272.40 → 2272.72] Of them
[2272.72 → 2273.52] Is an
[2273.52 → 2274.22] Edo mite
[2274.22 → 2274.58] By the
[2274.58 → 2274.92] Name of
[2274.92 → 2275.78] Haddad
[2275.78 → 2277.00] Who in
[2277.00 → 2277.40] The time
[2277.40 → 2278.06] Of David
[2278.06 → 2279.18] There was a
[2279.18 → 2279.94] Defeat of the
[2279.94 → 2280.48] Edo mites
[2280.48 → 2280.96] And many
[2280.96 → 2282.16] Were apparently
[2282.16 → 2282.82] Slaughtered
[2282.82 → 2283.22] But he
[2283.22 → 2283.92] Escapes
[2283.92 → 2284.26] And he
[2284.26 → 2284.82] Flees
[2284.82 → 2285.32] To Egypt

[2288.26 → 2289.14] Well he
[2289.14 → 2289.40] Probably
[2289.40 → 2289.82] Wasn't
[2289.82 → 2290.28] A

[2295.64 → 2295.94] Could
[2295.94 → 2296.22] Even

[3257.68 → 3258.22] Totally
[3258.22 → 3258.78] But
[3258.78 → 3259.00] It's
