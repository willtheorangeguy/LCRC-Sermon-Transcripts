[1122.80 --> 1152.78]  Thank you.
[1152.78 --> 1182.76]  Thank you.
[1182.76 --> 1212.74]  Thank you.
[1212.76 --> 1242.74]  Thank you.
[1242.76 --> 1272.74]  Thank you.
[1272.76 --> 1302.74]  Thank you.
[1302.76 --> 1332.74]  Thank you.
[1332.76 --> 1362.74]  Thank you.
[1362.76 --> 1392.74]  Thank you.
[1392.76 --> 1422.74]  Thank you.
[1422.76 --> 1452.74]  Thank you.
[1452.76 --> 1482.74]  Thank you.
[1482.74 --> 1512.72]  Thank you.
[1512.72 --> 1542.70]  Thank you.
[1542.70 --> 1572.68]  Thank you.
[1572.68 --> 1602.66]  Thank you.
[1602.66 --> 1632.66]  Thank you.
[1632.66 --> 1662.66]  Thank you.
[1662.66 --> 1692.64]  Thank you.
[1692.66 --> 1722.66]  Thank you.
[1722.66 --> 1752.64]  Thank you.
[1752.64 --> 1782.64]  Thank you.
[1782.64 --> 1812.64]  Thank you.
[1812.64 --> 1842.62]  Thank you.
[1842.64 --> 1872.62]  Thank you.
[1872.62 --> 1875.42]  as a sort of reconquest of the land,
[1876.20 --> 1879.06]  and he begins appropriately where?
[1879.74 --> 1880.54]  At Jericho.
[1881.98 --> 1888.72]  But this time, instead of destruction and curse,
[1890.24 --> 1895.60]  Elisha brings healing and cure.
[1899.26 --> 1901.40]  So he begins in Jericho,
[1901.40 --> 1905.12]  and the people of the city come to Elisha.
[1905.22 --> 1906.40]  They come to the prophet,
[1906.78 --> 1908.82]  and they present their case.
[1909.56 --> 1915.88]  They say, look, this city is in a good place.
[1916.10 --> 1917.84]  It's well-situated.
[1918.36 --> 1921.40]  As you can see,
[1922.86 --> 1927.82]  seeing in this whole chapter is a key thing that's going on.
[1927.82 --> 1929.70]  You remember earlier on,
[1930.04 --> 1932.00]  when Elijah was about to be taken up,
[1932.06 --> 1935.66]  he said, you have to see me be taken up.
[1936.64 --> 1939.04]  And we talked about that prophetic vision.
[1939.58 --> 1943.04]  Now they say, as you can see.
[1943.86 --> 1946.80]  And then in the next text,
[1946.88 --> 1948.94]  which I'm hoping we can cover next week,
[1948.94 --> 1954.44]  which is that very sometimes contentious text
[1954.44 --> 1957.62]  about the people of the youths from Bethel
[1957.62 --> 1961.32]  cursing or jeering, mocking Elisha,
[1961.38 --> 1963.86]  and he calls the bears out to maul them.
[1963.96 --> 1964.52]  Oh, my goodness.
[1965.20 --> 1967.50]  But it says, when they are mocking him,
[1967.62 --> 1971.04]  he turned around and he saw them.
[1971.10 --> 1972.94]  It makes it very specific in the text.
[1972.94 --> 1975.92]  So there's a lot of seeing going on here.
[1976.62 --> 1978.88]  Remember, in even more ancient times,
[1979.18 --> 1981.84]  the prophet was referred to as a seer.
[1982.38 --> 1984.78]  As you can see, Elisha,
[1985.36 --> 1988.04]  it's well-situated.
[1988.58 --> 1995.16]  But the water from the spring is bad or evil.
[1995.16 --> 2001.22]  And it goes on, and the NIV translates it as,
[2001.56 --> 2003.46]  the land is unproductive.
[2003.58 --> 2005.44]  I'm not happy with that translation.
[2005.76 --> 2009.30]  I don't think it's accurate of what the Hebrew really says.
[2009.56 --> 2012.16]  Because the term that's used for unproductive
[2012.74 --> 2016.18]  is literally the term that means to bereave,
[2016.78 --> 2019.24]  or it's the term for miscarriages,
[2019.72 --> 2020.90]  to have a miscarriage.
[2020.90 --> 2026.12]  And I think, so the Jerusalem Bible, for example,
[2026.24 --> 2026.84]  gets it better.
[2027.24 --> 2028.42]  The Jerusalem Bible says,
[2028.82 --> 2032.68]  the country suffers from miscarriages.
[2036.02 --> 2038.10]  And I think that's a better translation,
[2038.28 --> 2040.22]  because as I said, that's the usual meaning.
[2040.56 --> 2044.68]  But also, further down in verse 21 then,
[2045.08 --> 2046.48]  it says, then he went out to the spring,
[2046.54 --> 2047.40]  he throws in the salt.
[2047.70 --> 2048.68]  This is what the Lord says,
[2048.68 --> 2050.30]  I have healed this water.
[2050.30 --> 2055.94]  Never again will it cause death or miscarriages.
[2056.40 --> 2057.94]  That's actually, it doesn't say the land,
[2058.28 --> 2060.04]  it doesn't even have the term land there.
[2060.58 --> 2063.90]  It just says death or bereavement,
[2064.90 --> 2066.74]  unproductivity, miscarriages.
[2067.02 --> 2068.32]  Now I think that's important,
[2068.54 --> 2072.28]  so that we actually see how serious this problem is.
[2072.28 --> 2079.46]  It's not just like it's been a bad year for berries or wheat.
[2080.92 --> 2082.66]  There's death happening.
[2082.66 --> 2086.24]  This is deadly serious.
[2086.30 --> 2087.32]  This is deadly serious.
[2088.44 --> 2091.12]  And we need healing.
[2091.12 --> 2096.28]  Now, you have to remember a little bit of the history,
[2096.44 --> 2098.32]  and I think most of you are familiar with this,
[2098.44 --> 2100.98]  but just to look quickly at the story,
[2101.12 --> 2105.44]  in Joshua chapter 6, verse 26,
[2105.58 --> 2108.12]  you remember how when the people came into the land,
[2108.18 --> 2109.08]  and they conquered it,
[2109.14 --> 2110.40]  the walls came tumbling down,
[2110.48 --> 2111.36]  and at the end of that,
[2111.50 --> 2114.74]  Joshua pronounced this solemn oath.
[2115.70 --> 2118.72]  Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes
[2118.72 --> 2120.48]  to rebuild this city, Jericho.
[2120.70 --> 2122.24]  At the cost of his firstborn,
[2122.34 --> 2123.48]  he will lay its foundations.
[2123.90 --> 2125.22]  At the cost of his youngest,
[2125.64 --> 2127.50]  he will set up its gates.
[2127.96 --> 2131.46]  And so there was this promised curse coming,
[2132.42 --> 2134.38]  and for a long time, apparently,
[2134.38 --> 2138.32]  Jericho was largely abandoned.
[2139.62 --> 2143.34]  But then in 1 Kings,
[2143.34 --> 2147.18]  when wicked King Ahab comes along,
[2147.48 --> 2150.68]  at the very outset of his reign,
[2150.98 --> 2153.56]  we are told in 1 Kings 16, verse 34,
[2154.06 --> 2155.62]  in Ahab's time,
[2156.02 --> 2158.44]  Hiel of Bethel,
[2159.04 --> 2161.40]  which is where Elisha is headed next,
[2162.20 --> 2165.74]  Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho.
[2166.16 --> 2168.00]  He laid its foundations at the cost
[2168.00 --> 2169.88]  of his firstborn son, Abiram,
[2169.88 --> 2171.64]  and he set up its gates
[2171.64 --> 2173.94]  at the cost of his youngest son, Segub,
[2174.42 --> 2176.10]  in accordance with the word of the Lord
[2176.10 --> 2178.14]  spoken by Joshua, son of Nun.
[2179.36 --> 2182.54]  So you see, there is this curse on Jericho,
[2182.70 --> 2184.94]  and what presumably is happening here,
[2185.28 --> 2186.14]  that curse,
[2186.28 --> 2187.92]  even though it was played out
[2187.92 --> 2189.48]  when it was first rebuilt,
[2189.84 --> 2191.26]  to a certain sense,
[2191.34 --> 2192.58]  that curse continues.
[2193.74 --> 2196.26]  There is still a huge problem,
[2196.26 --> 2199.32]  a deadly problem in Jericho.
[2203.04 --> 2203.84]  And so,
[2204.28 --> 2206.66]  they call for Elisha to heal the waters,
[2206.90 --> 2209.10]  and Elisha goes through this ritual.
[2209.22 --> 2209.44]  He says,
[2209.54 --> 2210.52]  bring me a new bowl.
[2210.62 --> 2212.14]  We don't know exactly what that's all about.
[2212.26 --> 2212.70]  Maybe it's,
[2213.18 --> 2214.60]  there's a new thing starting,
[2214.76 --> 2215.62]  and salt,
[2216.62 --> 2217.34]  of all things,
[2217.46 --> 2218.66]  salt to heal waters
[2218.66 --> 2219.96]  seems kind of crazy,
[2220.38 --> 2221.88]  but salt in the Old Testament
[2221.88 --> 2223.88]  was part of the covenant.
[2223.88 --> 2227.30]  We talk so often about a covenant of salt,
[2227.82 --> 2230.36]  and the importance of that.
[2230.62 --> 2231.08]  And so,
[2231.42 --> 2234.62]  there's all this ritual going on,
[2235.50 --> 2241.16]  but what's clear here,
[2241.54 --> 2243.02]  is that something else is going on.
[2243.20 --> 2244.36]  Now, there's a connection here,
[2244.58 --> 2244.80]  with,
[2245.16 --> 2246.34]  back in Exodus 15.
[2246.56 --> 2248.72]  If you remember the story of Moses,
[2248.84 --> 2249.60]  when he leads the people,
[2249.84 --> 2251.00]  they've just crossed the Red Sea,
[2251.14 --> 2252.20]  they're in Sinai,
[2252.20 --> 2256.02]  and they come to the bitter waters at Marah.
[2256.74 --> 2257.80]  And when they're out there,
[2257.88 --> 2258.52]  they complain,
[2259.14 --> 2260.44]  and Moses takes a log,
[2260.50 --> 2261.80]  he throws it into the water,
[2262.06 --> 2263.86]  and the water is made,
[2264.08 --> 2264.60]  is healed,
[2265.02 --> 2266.32]  is made whole again.
[2267.20 --> 2269.16]  And a similar kind of thing
[2269.16 --> 2270.64]  is happening here.
[2272.14 --> 2274.14]  But the key thing
[2274.14 --> 2275.18]  is not the ritual.
[2276.04 --> 2277.74]  The key thing is verse 21.
[2277.74 --> 2281.76]  This is what the Lord says.
[2282.42 --> 2286.78]  I have healed these waters.
[2288.20 --> 2292.50]  The Lord is the one healing the waters.
[2292.50 --> 2296.72]  In neighbors,
[2297.22 --> 2299.14]  and friends of ours,
[2299.36 --> 2300.60]  in Vancouver,
[2301.12 --> 2301.58]  recently,
[2301.74 --> 2302.94]  during the COVID season,
[2303.58 --> 2304.84]  they had a baby,
[2305.10 --> 2305.62]  in July.
[2306.54 --> 2307.12]  And so,
[2307.28 --> 2308.74]  we were kind of waiting for this,
[2308.92 --> 2310.98]  because we've gotten connected with them a little bit,
[2311.04 --> 2311.92]  and they're a Jewish family.
[2312.30 --> 2312.60]  And so,
[2312.64 --> 2313.32]  we've gotten connected,
[2313.42 --> 2314.08]  and gotten to know them.
[2314.44 --> 2314.82]  And so,
[2314.88 --> 2315.46]  the baby's coming.
[2315.54 --> 2316.20]  We know it's coming.
[2316.28 --> 2316.50]  We're like,
[2316.56 --> 2316.76]  oh,
[2316.84 --> 2317.52]  wonder when,
[2317.60 --> 2318.46]  wonder if they've had the baby.
[2318.52 --> 2319.52]  I haven't seen anything for a while.
[2319.52 --> 2320.20]  And then,
[2320.52 --> 2321.04]  one day,
[2321.20 --> 2323.48]  we bumped into the dad outside,
[2323.72 --> 2324.42]  and we said,
[2324.76 --> 2325.04]  well,
[2325.16 --> 2326.78]  and he had this big smile on his face,
[2326.84 --> 2327.18]  and he said,
[2327.24 --> 2327.48]  yeah,
[2327.68 --> 2328.86]  we had the baby.
[2329.80 --> 2330.02]  Well,
[2330.06 --> 2330.84]  my wife had the baby.
[2331.28 --> 2331.60]  And he said,
[2331.76 --> 2332.56]  and we said,
[2332.64 --> 2332.76]  well,
[2332.88 --> 2334.54]  what did you name?
[2334.74 --> 2335.48]  Baby boy.
[2335.58 --> 2336.20]  And he was all excited.
[2336.32 --> 2337.26]  It's their second baby,
[2337.36 --> 2338.22]  and the second baby boy.
[2338.52 --> 2339.32]  He was all excited.
[2339.68 --> 2339.86]  He said,
[2339.92 --> 2340.04]  well,
[2340.08 --> 2340.88]  what did you name him?
[2341.14 --> 2341.94]  And he said,
[2342.18 --> 2344.60]  we named him Raphael.
[2345.26 --> 2346.24]  And we said,
[2347.20 --> 2348.02]  perfect.
[2348.02 --> 2348.32]  Perfect.
[2349.52 --> 2351.00]  Raphael.
[2352.04 --> 2353.82]  God heals.
[2355.10 --> 2355.84]  And he said,
[2356.32 --> 2356.64]  yeah,
[2356.90 --> 2358.40]  that's what we need today,
[2358.46 --> 2358.96]  isn't it?
[2360.68 --> 2361.48]  Raphael.
[2361.88 --> 2364.74]  And that's the term that's used here.
[2365.20 --> 2365.80]  It's Rapha,
[2366.08 --> 2366.78]  to heal.
[2367.18 --> 2369.98]  That's the term that's used in Exodus 15.
[2370.22 --> 2373.50]  And that is indeed God's desire.
[2374.02 --> 2377.10]  That is ultimately what God wants to do.
[2377.10 --> 2380.22]  He wants to bring healing,
[2380.72 --> 2383.18]  not destruction.
[2384.16 --> 2386.86]  That's really God's primary aim.
[2387.10 --> 2388.28]  He doesn't want to curse.
[2389.24 --> 2390.90]  He wants to heal.
[2391.70 --> 2395.70]  I was reminded of this reading through Ezekiel recently.
[2396.26 --> 2396.92]  And Ezekiel,
[2397.00 --> 2397.42]  for example,
[2397.62 --> 2399.08]  in Ezekiel 18,
[2399.42 --> 2400.10]  verse 23,
[2400.10 --> 2400.70]  23,
[2400.70 --> 2402.04]  where the Lord says,
[2402.54 --> 2405.08]  do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,
[2405.30 --> 2406.54]  declares the sovereign Lord?
[2407.08 --> 2407.56]  Rather,
[2407.82 --> 2413.28]  am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
[2414.56 --> 2416.26]  And then in Ezekiel 33,
[2416.54 --> 2417.38]  verse 11,
[2417.78 --> 2418.56]  say to them,
[2418.62 --> 2420.12]  that is to the people of Israel,
[2420.82 --> 2422.26]  as surely as I live,
[2422.36 --> 2423.64]  declares the sovereign Lord,
[2423.64 --> 2426.10]  I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
[2426.44 --> 2429.28]  but rather that they turn from their ways and live.
[2429.70 --> 2430.18]  Turn,
[2430.58 --> 2432.34]  turn from your evil ways.
[2432.68 --> 2433.80]  Why will you die,
[2433.98 --> 2434.68]  people of Israel?
[2434.96 --> 2436.76]  And do you hear God's passion there?
[2437.58 --> 2438.98]  His intense,
[2439.22 --> 2440.20]  passionate desire
[2440.20 --> 2441.72]  that people would,
[2441.80 --> 2443.14]  would turn
[2443.14 --> 2445.00]  and live
[2445.00 --> 2447.34]  and be healed
[2447.34 --> 2448.52]  by the Lord.
[2448.52 --> 2452.50]  If you go on in Ezekiel,
[2452.50 --> 2453.16]  I won't read it,
[2453.24 --> 2455.06]  but in Ezekiel 47,
[2456.02 --> 2456.90]  near the end,
[2456.96 --> 2458.42]  you remember the end of Ezekiel
[2458.42 --> 2459.98]  has that beautiful picture
[2459.98 --> 2460.40]  of the,
[2460.40 --> 2461.34]  the rebuilding,
[2461.64 --> 2462.42]  it's a vision really
[2462.42 --> 2463.20]  of the rebuilding
[2463.20 --> 2464.24]  of the,
[2464.28 --> 2465.20]  the temple
[2465.20 --> 2465.88]  and,
[2465.96 --> 2466.32]  and the,
[2466.50 --> 2467.72]  the reorganizing,
[2467.92 --> 2469.42]  rebuilding of the,
[2469.42 --> 2470.74]  the whole people of God,
[2470.84 --> 2471.84]  the nation of Israel.
[2472.10 --> 2472.92]  And at the end,
[2473.08 --> 2474.38]  in chapter 47,
[2474.48 --> 2474.96]  near the end,
[2475.38 --> 2475.60]  the,
[2475.64 --> 2477.10]  the river is coming out
[2477.10 --> 2478.40]  from the temple.
[2478.52 --> 2479.22]  from the threshold
[2479.22 --> 2479.78]  of the temple
[2479.78 --> 2480.58]  and it,
[2480.58 --> 2481.22]  it goes out
[2481.22 --> 2481.62]  and it flows
[2481.62 --> 2482.60]  and it gets deeper
[2482.60 --> 2483.22]  and deeper
[2483.22 --> 2483.78]  and deeper
[2483.78 --> 2484.80]  as it goes.
[2486.02 --> 2486.94]  And eventually,
[2486.94 --> 2487.98]  it runs
[2487.98 --> 2489.56]  through the Arabah,
[2489.70 --> 2490.82]  through the desert
[2490.82 --> 2492.54]  and right down
[2492.54 --> 2493.58]  to the salt sea
[2493.58 --> 2494.48]  or the dead sea
[2494.48 --> 2495.60]  and it says,
[2496.00 --> 2496.08]  and,
[2496.24 --> 2497.20]  and the translation says,
[2497.32 --> 2499.02]  the waters will be fresh.
[2499.64 --> 2500.24]  But literally,
[2500.36 --> 2500.64]  it says,
[2500.86 --> 2502.52]  the waters are healed.
[2503.16 --> 2503.96]  It's the same term,
[2504.08 --> 2504.32]  Rafa.
[2505.16 --> 2506.68]  The waters were healed.
[2507.20 --> 2508.00]  And then,
[2508.00 --> 2509.38]  later on in that chapter,
[2509.48 --> 2510.24]  in verse 12,
[2510.56 --> 2513.10]  it speaks of how the,
[2513.28 --> 2515.50]  there's these trees lining the river
[2515.50 --> 2517.92]  and they're perpetually bearing fruit.
[2518.88 --> 2519.94]  And it says,
[2520.88 --> 2523.36]  the leaves are for healing.
[2524.08 --> 2525.28]  The same term.
[2526.22 --> 2529.34]  God's desire for healing
[2529.34 --> 2531.18]  for his people,
[2531.70 --> 2533.12]  for the world.
[2533.12 --> 2534.92]  And of course,
[2534.98 --> 2535.52]  I'm reminded
[2535.52 --> 2538.00]  that in Revelation,
[2538.86 --> 2539.78]  which reflects back
[2539.78 --> 2541.12]  so much on Ezekiel,
[2541.80 --> 2543.06]  in Revelation 22,
[2543.46 --> 2543.82]  again,
[2543.92 --> 2544.98]  there's a river
[2544.98 --> 2546.02]  coming out
[2546.02 --> 2548.32]  and there's the tree
[2548.32 --> 2549.16]  of life
[2549.16 --> 2550.64]  and it says,
[2550.80 --> 2551.58]  its leaves
[2551.58 --> 2553.66]  are for the healing
[2553.66 --> 2556.60]  of the nations now.
[2556.68 --> 2557.74]  Not just for the people
[2557.74 --> 2558.18]  of Israel,
[2558.18 --> 2560.06]  but for the nations.
[2561.66 --> 2563.00]  God's desire
[2563.00 --> 2564.72]  is to heal.
[2566.42 --> 2566.66]  You know,
[2566.74 --> 2567.66]  the book of Kings,
[2567.84 --> 2568.50]  the Old Testament
[2568.50 --> 2569.32]  as a whole,
[2569.84 --> 2570.32]  often,
[2570.48 --> 2570.96]  too often,
[2571.10 --> 2571.84]  but the book of Kings
[2571.84 --> 2572.36]  in particular,
[2572.46 --> 2573.90]  it gets a lot of bad press.
[2574.96 --> 2576.96]  And a superficial reading,
[2577.18 --> 2579.20]  maybe a too quick reading,
[2579.34 --> 2580.30]  and a superficial reading,
[2580.52 --> 2581.96]  it can look sometimes,
[2582.06 --> 2582.64]  as some have said,
[2582.64 --> 2582.86]  like,
[2583.24 --> 2584.38]  God's a bit like
[2584.38 --> 2585.70]  a capricious,
[2586.20 --> 2588.32]  vindictive God
[2588.32 --> 2589.02]  who's just like
[2589.02 --> 2591.02]  eager to punish
[2591.02 --> 2591.78]  his people.
[2592.10 --> 2593.16]  And people have taken
[2593.16 --> 2593.60]  that attack
[2593.60 --> 2594.32]  and some people
[2594.32 --> 2595.46]  have just rejected it
[2595.46 --> 2596.36]  outright.
[2597.32 --> 2598.60]  The new atheists,
[2599.88 --> 2601.08]  that's one of their
[2601.08 --> 2601.54]  big points,
[2601.60 --> 2603.00]  this bloodthirsty God,
[2603.12 --> 2603.92]  how could anyone
[2603.92 --> 2604.76]  worship a God
[2604.76 --> 2605.46]  like that?
[2606.32 --> 2607.02]  But it's not just
[2607.02 --> 2607.76]  the new atheists,
[2607.76 --> 2608.60]  all through history,
[2609.14 --> 2609.80]  back to even
[2609.80 --> 2611.64]  the second century A.D.,
[2611.64 --> 2613.16]  Marcion,
[2613.46 --> 2614.22]  the heretic,
[2615.86 --> 2616.18]  who,
[2616.64 --> 2617.28]  when he
[2617.28 --> 2619.46]  tried to bring out
[2619.46 --> 2620.20]  the New Testament,
[2620.30 --> 2620.72]  they didn't have
[2620.72 --> 2621.44]  the full New Testament,
[2621.62 --> 2621.92]  but, you know,
[2621.98 --> 2622.66]  the Gospels
[2622.66 --> 2624.16]  and the letters
[2624.16 --> 2625.22]  of Paul at that time,
[2626.02 --> 2627.40]  but he didn't want
[2627.40 --> 2628.24]  anything to do
[2628.24 --> 2629.10]  with the Old Testament.
[2629.94 --> 2631.06]  And any reference
[2631.06 --> 2632.48]  to the Old Testament
[2632.48 --> 2633.92]  in the books
[2633.92 --> 2634.34]  of the New
[2634.34 --> 2635.06]  that he had
[2635.06 --> 2635.92]  were simply
[2635.92 --> 2636.78]  excised
[2636.78 --> 2638.90]  because he didn't
[2638.90 --> 2639.58]  want anything to do.
[2639.66 --> 2639.78]  He thought,
[2639.98 --> 2640.46]  that's the God
[2640.46 --> 2641.04]  of the Old Testament,
[2641.04 --> 2642.36]  that's a bad God.
[2643.42 --> 2644.42]  We only have
[2644.42 --> 2645.30]  Jesus Christ,
[2645.74 --> 2646.00]  the God
[2646.00 --> 2646.66]  of the New Testament.
[2648.04 --> 2648.66]  And that,
[2649.02 --> 2649.64]  throughout history,
[2649.70 --> 2650.44]  has been a problem.
[2650.58 --> 2651.48]  How do we tackle
[2651.48 --> 2652.56]  this God
[2652.56 --> 2653.26]  of the Old Testament?
[2653.62 --> 2654.92]  But the point is,
[2654.98 --> 2656.26]  if you look deeper,
[2657.46 --> 2658.54]  it isn't like that
[2658.54 --> 2659.08]  at all.
[2659.78 --> 2660.96]  And just a few points.
[2661.76 --> 2662.90]  The Book of Kings,
[2662.90 --> 2663.94]  the whole
[2663.94 --> 2665.56]  one and two kings,
[2666.32 --> 2667.48]  actually covers
[2667.48 --> 2668.64]  a span
[2668.64 --> 2670.56]  of four centuries.
[2671.72 --> 2672.70]  400 years.
[2672.82 --> 2673.54]  We can read through
[2673.54 --> 2674.18]  it really quickly,
[2674.30 --> 2674.50]  right?
[2675.28 --> 2676.24]  But in fact,
[2676.66 --> 2677.80]  this is an incredibly
[2677.80 --> 2678.70]  long period of time.
[2678.80 --> 2679.18]  The U.S.
[2679.20 --> 2680.16]  is just coming up
[2680.16 --> 2681.72]  to 250 years.
[2682.86 --> 2683.86]  400 years
[2684.74 --> 2686.24]  of God.
[2688.02 --> 2689.42]  God's patience.
[2690.08 --> 2690.82]  If anything,
[2691.64 --> 2692.42]  why did he take
[2692.42 --> 2693.04]  so long?
[2693.04 --> 2694.20]  If anything,
[2694.38 --> 2694.98]  God is almost
[2694.98 --> 2696.50]  overly indulgent
[2696.50 --> 2697.32]  with his people
[2697.32 --> 2698.62]  in waiting
[2698.62 --> 2700.26]  and holding
[2700.26 --> 2701.38]  back punishment.
[2705.96 --> 2707.04]  He continuously
[2707.84 --> 2709.46]  also brings
[2709.46 --> 2710.22]  the words
[2710.22 --> 2711.48]  of the prophets
[2711.48 --> 2712.48]  to his people,
[2713.06 --> 2713.88]  warning them
[2713.88 --> 2714.98]  over and over again.
[2715.18 --> 2716.42]  Sometimes harsh words
[2716.42 --> 2717.10]  which they needed
[2717.10 --> 2717.46]  to hear,
[2717.58 --> 2718.04]  but God's
[2718.72 --> 2719.04]  gracious
[2719.56 --> 2720.38]  word
[2720.38 --> 2721.30]  of warning
[2721.30 --> 2722.80]  calling his people
[2722.80 --> 2723.32]  back.
[2728.38 --> 2730.02]  He continuously,
[2730.38 --> 2730.56]  too,
[2731.08 --> 2731.86]  preserves
[2731.86 --> 2732.98]  a remnant,
[2733.32 --> 2734.42]  a faithful few.
[2735.52 --> 2736.78]  Back in 1 Kings 18,
[2736.98 --> 2737.44]  you have those
[2737.44 --> 2738.92]  100 prophets,
[2739.16 --> 2740.12]  two groups of 50,
[2740.40 --> 2741.58]  who were saved
[2741.58 --> 2742.92]  by righteous
[2742.92 --> 2743.66]  Obadiah
[2743.66 --> 2744.78]  from wicked
[2744.78 --> 2745.50]  king,
[2746.14 --> 2746.62]  or queen
[2746.62 --> 2747.22]  Jezebel.
[2747.36 --> 2748.16]  He hides them
[2748.16 --> 2749.06]  out in caves.
[2750.06 --> 2751.22]  100 faithful,
[2751.30 --> 2751.88]  prophets.
[2752.52 --> 2753.38]  Much of the time,
[2753.44 --> 2754.24]  Elijah is
[2754.24 --> 2755.60]  portrayed
[2755.60 --> 2757.56]  as a lone
[2757.56 --> 2758.10]  prophet,
[2758.46 --> 2759.16]  but in fact,
[2759.68 --> 2761.18]  1 Kings 19,
[2762.00 --> 2763.30]  God says to
[2763.30 --> 2763.72]  Elijah,
[2763.86 --> 2764.18]  wait a minute,
[2764.26 --> 2765.70]  there's 7,000
[2765.70 --> 2766.86]  I've reserved,
[2767.52 --> 2767.98]  faithful,
[2768.46 --> 2769.14]  who have not
[2769.14 --> 2769.84]  bowed the knee
[2769.84 --> 2770.86]  or kissed veil.
[2770.86 --> 2770.92]  people.
[2772.12 --> 2773.50]  And when we get
[2773.50 --> 2774.32]  to 1 Kings,
[2774.88 --> 2776.04]  2 Kings 2,
[2776.40 --> 2777.38]  we're introduced
[2777.38 --> 2778.08]  to these
[2778.08 --> 2779.50]  groups of,
[2779.66 --> 2780.24]  or companies
[2780.24 --> 2781.44]  of the sons
[2781.44 --> 2782.18]  of the prophets.
[2783.10 --> 2783.66]  Again,
[2783.74 --> 2784.70]  it's almost as if
[2784.70 --> 2786.56]  Elijah's almost
[2786.56 --> 2787.66]  lone voice
[2787.66 --> 2789.00]  brought out of the
[2789.00 --> 2789.56]  woodwork
[2789.56 --> 2791.60]  faithful followers,
[2792.02 --> 2792.70]  and there are
[2792.70 --> 2793.58]  these companies
[2793.58 --> 2795.04]  of true prophets.
[2795.78 --> 2796.56]  Remember Elijah
[2796.56 --> 2797.98]  back in 1 Kings 18,
[2797.98 --> 2798.86]  it's him
[2798.86 --> 2799.52]  against the
[2799.52 --> 2800.92]  450 prophets
[2800.92 --> 2801.32]  of Baal,
[2801.40 --> 2802.24]  but by this time,
[2802.64 --> 2803.10]  there are these
[2803.10 --> 2803.96]  other companies
[2803.96 --> 2805.48]  of faithful prophets,
[2805.78 --> 2807.32]  God preserving
[2807.32 --> 2808.74]  the faithful.
[2808.74 --> 2812.74]  And of course,
[2812.94 --> 2813.56]  when we get to
[2813.56 --> 2814.72]  Jericho in this
[2814.72 --> 2815.18]  text,
[2815.80 --> 2817.64]  God heals
[2817.64 --> 2819.44]  the water
[2819.44 --> 2821.00]  at Jericho
[2821.00 --> 2823.20]  in response,
[2823.56 --> 2824.28]  keep in mind,
[2824.82 --> 2825.70]  to the people
[2825.70 --> 2828.02]  humbly seeking
[2828.02 --> 2829.88]  God's help.
[2830.74 --> 2832.44]  They turn to
[2832.44 --> 2833.24]  the prophet of
[2833.24 --> 2833.68]  the Lord,
[2833.98 --> 2835.32]  and they hear
[2835.32 --> 2836.12]  his word,
[2836.28 --> 2836.84]  which is very
[2836.84 --> 2837.40]  different from
[2837.40 --> 2838.38]  the next response.
[2838.38 --> 2839.04]  in the very
[2839.04 --> 2839.70]  next text,
[2839.98 --> 2840.56]  we'll look at
[2840.56 --> 2841.14]  next week.
[2843.04 --> 2844.60]  God's grace
[2844.60 --> 2845.86]  at work,
[2846.62 --> 2847.28]  all through
[2847.28 --> 2847.82]  the book of
[2847.82 --> 2848.22]  Kings.
[2849.64 --> 2850.24]  God,
[2850.52 --> 2852.14]  the healer.
[2855.60 --> 2856.42]  We've seen
[2856.42 --> 2857.30]  how there's
[2857.30 --> 2857.88]  this sort of
[2857.88 --> 2859.00]  Moses to
[2859.00 --> 2859.54]  Joshua,
[2860.28 --> 2861.10]  and then going
[2861.10 --> 2861.82]  on from
[2861.82 --> 2862.88]  Elijah
[2862.88 --> 2864.66]  to Elisha,
[2865.02 --> 2865.70]  and if you
[2865.70 --> 2866.42]  recall last
[2866.42 --> 2866.62]  time,
[2866.76 --> 2867.20]  I also,
[2867.20 --> 2868.36]  we pointed
[2868.36 --> 2868.56]  out,
[2868.64 --> 2868.94]  we looked
[2868.94 --> 2869.38]  at how
[2869.38 --> 2870.30]  that looks
[2870.30 --> 2870.84]  forward,
[2871.32 --> 2871.94]  Elijah to
[2871.94 --> 2872.54]  Elisha,
[2872.68 --> 2873.94]  to John
[2873.94 --> 2874.70]  the Baptist,
[2875.36 --> 2876.18]  to Jesus,
[2876.84 --> 2877.48]  and Jesus
[2877.48 --> 2879.34]  becoming this
[2879.34 --> 2880.12]  new,
[2880.30 --> 2881.18]  second almost
[2881.18 --> 2882.84]  Elisha in
[2882.84 --> 2883.52]  his day.
[2884.20 --> 2885.18]  And like
[2885.18 --> 2886.12]  Jesus,
[2887.10 --> 2888.02]  Elisha,
[2888.24 --> 2888.66]  when he's
[2888.66 --> 2889.18]  anointed,
[2890.00 --> 2890.84]  gives much
[2890.84 --> 2892.26]  attention to
[2892.26 --> 2893.42]  food and
[2893.42 --> 2894.00]  drink.
[2894.34 --> 2894.88]  Read through
[2894.88 --> 2895.26]  it if you
[2895.26 --> 2895.50]  want,
[2895.90 --> 2896.72]  in the
[2896.72 --> 2897.30]  succeeding
[2897.30 --> 2898.14]  chapters.
[2899.14 --> 2899.58]  He makes
[2899.58 --> 2900.42]  a bad
[2900.42 --> 2901.36]  pot of soup
[2901.36 --> 2902.38]  better.
[2903.92 --> 2904.56]  At one
[2904.56 --> 2905.00]  point,
[2905.24 --> 2906.60]  he multiplies
[2906.60 --> 2908.16]  loaves to
[2908.16 --> 2908.98]  feed a
[2908.98 --> 2909.46]  multitude.
[2910.12 --> 2911.26]  Sound familiar?
[2914.46 --> 2915.68]  And here,
[2915.88 --> 2916.76]  he heals
[2916.76 --> 2918.10]  the water.
[2918.10 --> 2923.54]  God's grace
[2923.54 --> 2924.26]  at work
[2924.26 --> 2925.44]  in Elisha,
[2925.58 --> 2925.90]  and of
[2925.90 --> 2926.26]  course,
[2926.42 --> 2927.22]  it points
[2927.22 --> 2928.04]  to that
[2928.04 --> 2928.62]  much
[2928.62 --> 2929.58]  greater
[2929.58 --> 2930.62]  healer,
[2931.36 --> 2931.68]  Jesus.
[2933.12 --> 2933.82]  And I
[2933.82 --> 2934.26]  think this
[2934.26 --> 2935.72]  underlines
[2935.72 --> 2936.52]  just how
[2936.52 --> 2937.24]  important
[2937.24 --> 2938.00]  Jesus'
[2938.68 --> 2939.20]  healing
[2939.20 --> 2939.88]  ministry
[2939.88 --> 2940.34]  was.
[2940.84 --> 2941.26]  Remember
[2941.26 --> 2942.44]  how often
[2942.44 --> 2944.22]  the gospel
[2944.22 --> 2944.82]  accounts
[2944.82 --> 2946.06]  tell us
[2946.06 --> 2947.04]  how Jesus
[2947.04 --> 2947.92]  healed.
[2948.50 --> 2949.22]  He heals.
[2949.58 --> 2950.54]  He heals
[2950.54 --> 2951.10]  over and
[2951.10 --> 2951.42]  over again.
[2951.62 --> 2952.08]  Even the
[2952.08 --> 2953.18]  Greek word
[2953.18 --> 2954.10]  for salvation
[2954.10 --> 2955.58]  has in it
[2955.58 --> 2956.06]  that sense.
[2956.12 --> 2956.64]  It can mean
[2956.64 --> 2957.16]  just simply
[2957.16 --> 2957.64]  to heal,
[2957.78 --> 2958.46]  physical healing.
[2958.64 --> 2958.92]  It's a
[2958.92 --> 2959.70]  rescue from
[2959.70 --> 2960.92]  hardship,
[2961.36 --> 2962.32]  from danger,
[2962.46 --> 2962.94]  but also
[2962.94 --> 2963.70]  from illness.
[2964.94 --> 2965.40]  Jesus,
[2966.02 --> 2966.86]  the healer,
[2966.94 --> 2967.28]  that's a
[2967.28 --> 2968.44]  key point
[2968.44 --> 2969.70]  in his
[2969.70 --> 2970.12]  ministry.
[2970.30 --> 2970.68]  It's a key
[2970.68 --> 2971.28]  part of what
[2971.28 --> 2972.28]  he does.
[2972.44 --> 2977.42]  Jesus,
[2977.98 --> 2979.00]  the healer.
[2980.20 --> 2981.08]  But there's
[2981.08 --> 2981.70]  a difference.
[2982.02 --> 2982.32]  There's a
[2982.32 --> 2984.12]  twist in
[2984.12 --> 2984.42]  Jesus,
[2984.54 --> 2984.70]  right?
[2985.78 --> 2986.48]  Notice
[2986.48 --> 2987.32]  how
[2987.32 --> 2989.38]  Elisha
[2989.38 --> 2991.94]  announces
[2991.94 --> 2993.58]  the Lord's
[2993.58 --> 2994.12]  healing.
[2995.24 --> 2995.96]  The Lord
[2995.96 --> 2996.68]  says,
[2997.00 --> 2997.88]  I have
[2997.88 --> 2998.32]  healed this
[2998.32 --> 2998.60]  water.
[2999.84 --> 3000.20]  Jesus
[3000.20 --> 3000.80]  doesn't do
[3000.80 --> 3001.16]  that.
[3001.94 --> 3002.36]  He
[3002.36 --> 3003.34]  just
[3003.34 --> 3004.20]  heals.
[3005.90 --> 3006.62]  Because
[3006.62 --> 3007.84]  he is
[3007.84 --> 3008.80]  the Lord.
[3011.12 --> 3012.10]  He is
[3012.10 --> 3013.02]  more than
[3013.02 --> 3014.04]  just a
[3014.04 --> 3014.40]  prophet.
[3015.26 --> 3015.92]  He's the
[3015.92 --> 3016.18]  one who
[3016.18 --> 3016.52]  doesn't have
[3016.52 --> 3016.80]  to say,
[3016.88 --> 3017.32]  the Lord
[3017.32 --> 3017.82]  heal you.
[3017.96 --> 3018.50]  He says,
[3019.02 --> 3020.38]  I heal
[3020.38 --> 3020.88]  you.
[3022.00 --> 3022.78]  Jesus,
[3023.20 --> 3024.08]  the great
[3024.08 --> 3025.02]  healer.
[3025.02 --> 3026.02]  God's
[3026.02 --> 3027.02]  healing.
[3027.02 --> 3027.42]  And so
[3027.42 --> 3028.24]  that analogy,
[3028.42 --> 3028.84]  Elisha
[3028.84 --> 3029.20]  and Jesus
[3029.20 --> 3029.94]  only goes
[3029.94 --> 3030.60]  so far
[3030.60 --> 3031.60]  because
[3031.60 --> 3032.24]  Jesus is
[3032.24 --> 3033.56]  so much
[3033.56 --> 3034.60]  greater.
[3038.34 --> 3038.82]  Well,
[3038.86 --> 3039.08]  we live
[3039.08 --> 3039.28]  in a
[3039.28 --> 3039.76]  world that
[3039.76 --> 3040.18]  is in
[3040.18 --> 3040.62]  need of
[3040.62 --> 3040.96]  healing.
[3040.96 --> 3041.52]  And it
[3041.52 --> 3042.26]  always has
[3042.26 --> 3042.52]  been,
[3042.60 --> 3042.80]  and it
[3042.80 --> 3043.74]  will continue
[3043.74 --> 3044.04]  to be.
[3044.14 --> 3044.90]  But particularly
[3044.90 --> 3045.68]  we live in
[3045.68 --> 3045.96]  this,
[3046.46 --> 3048.22]  obviously,
[3048.56 --> 3048.84]  COVID
[3048.84 --> 3049.40]  season,
[3049.40 --> 3051.08]  where we
[3051.08 --> 3052.72]  need God's
[3052.72 --> 3053.34]  healing.
[3056.94 --> 3057.82]  We're
[3057.82 --> 3058.42]  struggling,
[3058.78 --> 3059.82]  searching for
[3059.82 --> 3060.62]  healing for
[3060.62 --> 3062.54]  racial injustice,
[3063.54 --> 3064.72]  social unrest.
[3064.72 --> 3068.88]  the United
[3068.88 --> 3070.02]  States needs
[3070.02 --> 3070.60]  healing.
[3071.56 --> 3072.06]  And many
[3072.06 --> 3072.72]  other countries
[3072.72 --> 3073.34]  do around
[3073.34 --> 3073.88]  the world,
[3074.80 --> 3075.54]  as do we.
[3077.62 --> 3078.00]  I was
[3078.00 --> 3079.14]  struck last
[3079.14 --> 3079.68]  night when
[3079.68 --> 3080.28]  Joe Biden,
[3080.36 --> 3081.10]  when he gave
[3081.10 --> 3081.96]  his talk,
[3083.08 --> 3084.22]  he quoted
[3084.22 --> 3085.14]  from Ecclesiastes,
[3085.52 --> 3086.02]  but did you
[3086.02 --> 3087.02]  notice at the
[3087.02 --> 3088.14]  end of
[3088.14 --> 3089.16]  the speech,
[3089.70 --> 3090.24]  he quoted
[3090.24 --> 3090.82]  a hymn.
[3091.20 --> 3091.76]  It's a great,
[3091.92 --> 3092.48]  beautiful hymn.
[3092.58 --> 3093.10]  It's a beautiful
[3093.10 --> 3093.76]  Catholic hymn.
[3093.76 --> 3094.92]  And it's
[3094.92 --> 3095.90]  that beautiful
[3095.90 --> 3096.24]  hymn,
[3096.68 --> 3097.56]  he will raise
[3097.56 --> 3098.60]  you up on
[3098.60 --> 3099.84]  eagle's wings.
[3100.36 --> 3101.38]  He'll hold
[3101.38 --> 3102.08]  you in the
[3102.08 --> 3102.82]  palm of his
[3102.82 --> 3103.26]  hand.
[3103.76 --> 3104.18]  I don't know
[3104.18 --> 3105.20]  if he fully
[3105.20 --> 3106.30]  realizes the
[3106.30 --> 3107.30]  significance of
[3107.30 --> 3108.66]  that, but you
[3108.66 --> 3109.28]  see, the whole
[3109.28 --> 3109.92]  point is,
[3110.16 --> 3111.82]  again, it's
[3111.82 --> 3113.32]  God who
[3113.32 --> 3113.94]  heals.
[3114.76 --> 3115.20]  Now, we
[3115.20 --> 3116.06]  work for it,
[3116.68 --> 3117.04]  and we're
[3117.04 --> 3117.90]  responsible to
[3117.90 --> 3119.24]  be ministering
[3119.24 --> 3119.76]  whatever way
[3119.76 --> 3120.20]  we can
[3120.20 --> 3121.10]  healing, but
[3121.10 --> 3122.80]  only God
[3122.80 --> 3123.66]  can true
[3123.66 --> 3124.50]  heal.
[3125.70 --> 3126.64]  The Lord
[3126.64 --> 3127.46]  says in
[3127.46 --> 3127.92]  this verse,
[3128.58 --> 3129.94]  I have
[3129.94 --> 3131.42]  healed these
[3131.42 --> 3131.92]  waters.
[3132.82 --> 3134.38]  Only God
[3134.38 --> 3135.66]  can truly
[3135.66 --> 3136.60]  heal.
[3139.60 --> 3141.00]  Revelation 22,
[3141.16 --> 3142.08]  again, the
[3142.08 --> 3142.78]  leaves of the
[3142.78 --> 3143.50]  tree are for
[3143.50 --> 3144.46]  the healing
[3144.46 --> 3145.48]  of the
[3145.48 --> 3146.04]  nations.
[3146.04 --> 3146.24]  nations.
[3148.84 --> 3150.02]  And again, the
[3150.02 --> 3150.88]  nations need
[3150.88 --> 3151.04]  it.
[3151.24 --> 3151.66]  But it's not
[3151.66 --> 3152.32]  just nations,
[3152.42 --> 3152.74]  is it?
[3153.20 --> 3154.54]  It's you
[3154.54 --> 3155.08]  and me.
[3155.96 --> 3156.60]  It's
[3156.60 --> 3157.28]  individuals.
[3158.16 --> 3158.76]  It's
[3158.76 --> 3159.30]  families.
[3159.88 --> 3160.92]  We all
[3160.92 --> 3162.08]  need healing.
[3163.36 --> 3164.34]  Healing for
[3164.34 --> 3166.42]  hurts in
[3166.42 --> 3166.86]  our own
[3166.86 --> 3167.98]  past, hurts
[3167.98 --> 3168.72]  done towards
[3168.72 --> 3169.72]  us, maybe
[3169.72 --> 3170.52]  even healings
[3170.52 --> 3171.24]  in the way
[3171.24 --> 3171.74]  we've hurt
[3171.74 --> 3172.36]  others.
[3172.36 --> 3175.06]  healing from
[3175.06 --> 3176.08]  addictions,
[3176.68 --> 3177.68]  whether it's
[3177.68 --> 3178.54]  to substances
[3178.54 --> 3179.76]  or pornography
[3179.76 --> 3180.72]  or whatever
[3180.72 --> 3181.52]  it is, but
[3181.52 --> 3183.10]  many of us,
[3183.22 --> 3183.84]  all of us
[3183.84 --> 3184.36]  need some
[3184.36 --> 3184.88]  kind of
[3184.88 --> 3186.34]  healing from
[3186.34 --> 3186.90]  our Lord.
[3186.90 --> 3192.42]  And I
[3192.42 --> 3193.96]  invite you to
[3193.96 --> 3194.58]  ask yourself,
[3194.82 --> 3195.74]  what do you
[3195.74 --> 3197.06]  need healing
[3197.06 --> 3199.14]  for in
[3199.14 --> 3199.48]  your own
[3199.48 --> 3199.84]  life?
[3201.14 --> 3201.88]  What in
[3201.88 --> 3202.46]  our midst
[3202.46 --> 3203.24]  do we need
[3203.24 --> 3203.88]  healing for?
[3204.04 --> 3204.70]  God's
[3204.70 --> 3205.26]  healing.
[3207.78 --> 3209.12]  I do
[3209.12 --> 3211.62]  believe in
[3211.62 --> 3212.84]  a God who
[3212.84 --> 3213.42]  heals.
[3214.78 --> 3215.38]  And that
[3215.38 --> 3216.36]  is our
[3216.36 --> 3217.00]  hope,
[3217.40 --> 3217.76]  friends.
[3220.54 --> 3221.22]  Suffering
[3221.22 --> 3222.52]  continues.
[3223.38 --> 3224.12]  Pain and
[3224.12 --> 3224.64]  death
[3224.64 --> 3226.08]  continue.
[3227.04 --> 3227.60]  But there
[3227.60 --> 3228.50]  can be
[3228.50 --> 3229.12]  healing that
[3229.12 --> 3230.22]  begins now,
[3230.46 --> 3231.60]  and ultimately
[3231.60 --> 3232.42]  we have the
[3232.42 --> 3232.98]  hope of
[3232.98 --> 3233.70]  complete healing.
[3234.56 --> 3235.24]  Why?
[3235.72 --> 3236.40]  Because as we
[3236.40 --> 3236.98]  sung earlier,
[3237.16 --> 3237.80]  the resurrection.
[3239.28 --> 3240.50]  That hope,
[3240.90 --> 3241.72]  Jesus Christ,
[3241.86 --> 3242.84]  the healer who
[3242.84 --> 3243.70]  defeated death,
[3243.70 --> 3245.28]  that is the
[3245.28 --> 3246.22]  hope for
[3246.22 --> 3247.50]  healing for
[3247.50 --> 3248.76]  all of
[3248.76 --> 3249.42]  God's people,
[3249.62 --> 3250.86]  for all the
[3250.86 --> 3251.54]  nations,
[3252.54 --> 3253.80]  for God's
[3253.80 --> 3254.64]  world.
[3256.14 --> 3257.40]  Jesus is
[3257.40 --> 3258.16]  our true
[3258.16 --> 3258.86]  hope, and so
[3258.86 --> 3259.58]  the invitation
[3259.58 --> 3260.92]  is like the
[3260.92 --> 3261.68]  people of
[3261.68 --> 3262.22]  Jericho,
[3263.22 --> 3264.74]  look to
[3264.74 --> 3266.68]  him for
[3266.68 --> 3267.36]  true healing.
[3267.58 --> 3267.98]  Let's pray.
[3267.98 --> 3270.14]  Father in
[3270.14 --> 3270.44]  heaven,
[3270.78 --> 3271.66]  thank you
[3271.66 --> 3272.12]  that you
[3272.12 --> 3272.94]  are the
[3272.94 --> 3273.44]  healer.
[3276.66 --> 3277.50]  And it's
[3277.50 --> 3278.32]  only in
[3278.32 --> 3279.02]  you that
[3279.02 --> 3279.42]  we will
[3279.42 --> 3280.12]  finally,
[3281.00 --> 3281.42]  truly,
[3282.42 --> 3285.16]  be fully
[3285.16 --> 3285.64]  healed.
[3287.64 --> 3288.52]  I pray
[3288.52 --> 3289.10]  that if
[3289.10 --> 3289.60]  there are
[3289.60 --> 3290.24]  some here
[3290.24 --> 3291.28]  who desperately
[3291.28 --> 3292.08]  need healing
[3292.08 --> 3292.66]  now,
[3293.64 --> 3294.02]  that you
[3294.02 --> 3294.84]  would minister
[3294.84 --> 3295.82]  into their
[3295.82 --> 3296.28]  lives,
[3297.18 --> 3297.86]  and do
[3297.86 --> 3298.94]  minister to
[3298.94 --> 3299.74]  all of us
[3299.74 --> 3301.38]  your healing
[3301.38 --> 3301.82]  and the
[3301.82 --> 3302.70]  hope for
[3302.70 --> 3303.08]  healing,
[3303.32 --> 3303.42]  Lord,
[3304.18 --> 3306.06]  in our
[3306.06 --> 3306.64]  own lives,
[3306.94 --> 3307.18]  in our
[3307.18 --> 3307.68]  families,
[3308.34 --> 3309.14]  in our
[3309.14 --> 3309.62]  community,
[3310.62 --> 3311.58]  and in
[3311.58 --> 3312.26]  this world.
[3316.36 --> 3317.12]  Grant your
[3317.12 --> 3317.56]  healing,
[3317.76 --> 3318.14]  Lord God,
[3318.46 --> 3319.44]  and we pray
[3319.44 --> 3319.80]  it in the
[3319.80 --> 3320.48]  name of the
[3320.48 --> 3321.72]  great healer,
[3322.02 --> 3322.90]  Jesus Christ.
[3323.76 --> 3324.14]  Amen.
[3324.14 --> 3324.24]  Amen.
[3325.82 --> 3326.82]  Amen.
[3326.86 --> 3327.50]  Amen.
[3333.84 --> 3334.12]  Amen.
[3334.12 --> 3364.10]  Thank you.
[3364.12 --> 3394.10]  Thank you.
[3394.12 --> 3424.10]  Thank you.
[3424.12 --> 3426.12]  Thank you.
[3454.12 --> 3456.12]  Thank you.
[3484.12 --> 3486.12]  Thank you.
[3486.12 --> 3488.12]  Thank you.
[3516.12 --> 3518.12]  Thank you.
[3518.12 --> 3520.12]  Thank you.
[3520.12 --> 3522.12]  Thank you.
[3522.12 --> 3524.12]  Thank you.
[3552.12 --> 3554.12]  Thank you.
[3554.12 --> 3556.12]  Thank you.
[3556.12 --> 3558.12]  Thank you.
[3558.12 --> 3560.12]  Thank you.
[3560.12 --> 3562.12]  Thank you.
[3562.12 --> 3564.12]  Thank you.
[3564.12 --> 3566.12]  Thank you.
[3566.12 --> 3568.12]  Thank you.
[3568.12 --> 3570.12]  Thank you.
[3570.12 --> 3578.12]  His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.
[3578.12 --> 3583.62]  My Jesus, Lord, I've been set free.
[3584.44 --> 3590.12]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.
[3590.58 --> 3600.10]  And my God, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.
[3600.12 --> 3630.10]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.
[3630.10 --> 3638.66]  This morning I came in a little bit late because I did have the privilege to lead the other side in Lord's Supper.
[3639.62 --> 3642.26]  And so I would do it in English and then Nancy would translate it.
[3642.26 --> 3647.78]  And it reminded me again of the message this morning, the healing of the nations.
[3648.02 --> 3651.36]  And that must come through the church and through evangelism and missions.
[3651.36 --> 3657.50]  And it is wonderful to see that now from every tribe and nation we serve the risen Lord.
[3657.50 --> 3671.32]  I don't know if I came in late, so I don't know if Jake told you this, but Kathy's slot is since Friday in the Irene Thomas hospice.
[3671.32 --> 3676.42]  And the only people basically that are allowed to visit are relatives.
[3677.76 --> 3684.82]  Kathy had last week a major seizure and she's in a very critical stage.
[3684.82 --> 3691.78]  Shall we pray now and ask the Lord for blessing and thanksgiving.
[3691.78 --> 3702.68]  Lord God of the nations, we thank you and we praise your holy name for who you are.
[3703.08 --> 3707.38]  Faithful God, never leaving us and never forsaking us.
[3707.38 --> 3714.82]  Lord, we thank you for another day of rest, another day of worship.
[3716.18 --> 3719.12]  That we may still worship you in freedom.
[3721.04 --> 3726.06]  We thank you, Lord, that this week we may remember again those who have fallen for our freedom.
[3728.30 --> 3731.44]  And Lord God, we know that it will be a different way this time.
[3731.44 --> 3741.58]  But we want to thank you even more, Lord God, that in a few moments we may remember again your blood and your sacrifice on the cross.
[3741.74 --> 3746.06]  And so that whoever believes in you will have eternal life.
[3748.56 --> 3755.20]  And Lord God, we can say that also with confidence and with the promise when we pray for our sick.
[3755.20 --> 3767.00]  When we pray for Kathy Slott and we pray for Tim and for Joan Bauman and for Gene Nyman in the hospital.
[3767.26 --> 3768.28]  And Lord, for many others.
[3769.48 --> 3773.76]  That the healing is for all of us in life and in death.
[3773.98 --> 3775.40]  You are our faithful Savior.
[3776.46 --> 3780.78]  And that is, and that we can confess, is our great comfort.
[3780.78 --> 3790.76]  Lord God, we pray also for Mel Rass, who is now in Alberta laying to rest here in one of his sisters.
[3791.66 --> 3793.96]  We pray, Lord, for friends of Michelle Kut.
[3794.06 --> 3795.50]  We think especially of Lina Zalstra.
[3796.64 --> 3804.30]  Michelle Kut, as many of us know, who is also literally in the end of this life, final days.
[3805.14 --> 3806.36]  Lord God, we pray for all those.
[3806.36 --> 3809.78]  And of course, of her, as this is a very difficult time.
[3810.78 --> 3815.68]  Heavenly Father, we pray again because of the situation for all our shut-ins.
[3816.68 --> 3819.54]  The great difficulty this is that we cannot visit.
[3819.96 --> 3821.68]  We pray, Lord, for those who are single.
[3822.36 --> 3825.86]  Widows and widowers and other single people amongst us.
[3826.42 --> 3828.66]  For whom life must be extremely difficult.
[3830.02 --> 3836.26]  May we, as the body of Christ, especially now, comforting and visiting one another.
[3836.26 --> 3842.04]  Lord God, your church is the healer of the nation.
[3842.16 --> 3843.22]  The church of Jesus Christ.
[3843.40 --> 3844.88]  And so, Lord, we pray for this church.
[3845.74 --> 3847.76]  And we pray for all churches around the world.
[3848.72 --> 3850.72]  That your name may be praised and proclaimed.
[3851.48 --> 3854.94]  That Jesus is the only Savior and the only healer.
[3854.94 --> 3858.44]  And that may also be expressed through us and in us.
[3859.18 --> 3860.90]  Through love and through reaching out.
[3861.56 --> 3864.84]  Lord God, we pray for this council.
[3864.98 --> 3866.48]  We pray for Jason and his family.
[3866.66 --> 3869.56]  We pray for Nancy and Hannah.
[3870.60 --> 3873.96]  And also for Gary, Lord, in reaching the seafarers.
[3873.96 --> 3876.52]  What a wonderful ministry this is.
[3876.78 --> 3880.18]  And especially now, as it is a very difficult time also.
[3880.84 --> 3882.30]  For those who are at sea.
[3883.52 --> 3885.44]  And so, Lord God, bless all those ministries.
[3887.14 --> 3890.00]  Heavenly Father, we pray for the healing of the nations.
[3891.64 --> 3893.56]  And there are many requests.
[3894.00 --> 3900.72]  And there is a long searching and debating of what happened.
[3900.72 --> 3904.60]  Especially south of the border in his last months and weeks and last days.
[3906.20 --> 3908.16]  Lord God, you are the sovereign God.
[3909.32 --> 3913.32]  And with that in mind, we can lay our head to rest every night.
[3913.78 --> 3914.50]  That you are sovereign.
[3915.32 --> 3918.36]  That you raise up kings and that you bring them down.
[3919.22 --> 3921.24]  You are the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[3922.88 --> 3925.38]  And so, Lord God, with that in mind, we can leave this place again.
[3925.38 --> 3931.24]  Knowing that we are in safe, the safe hands of the almighty God.
[3932.04 --> 3934.46]  Whom we worship through Jesus Christ.
[3935.46 --> 3937.34]  Will you bless us and will you keep us.
[3937.86 --> 3940.96]  And as we come together now, Lord, for that beautiful meal.
[3941.88 --> 3945.54]  What a privilege it is to be called children of God.
[3946.28 --> 3949.40]  We ask this in the name of Jesus, our Lord and our only Savior.
[3950.04 --> 3950.36]  Amen.
[3950.36 --> 3950.42]  Amen.
[3955.38 --> 3956.28]  Amen.
[3984.46 --> 3984.70]  Amen.
[3984.70 --> 3984.84]  Amen.
[3984.84 --> 4010.64]  I will feast on the table of the Lord.
[4010.64 --> 4017.54]  I will feast on the table of the Lord.
[4018.74 --> 4026.64]  I won't hunger anymore at this table.
[4030.64 --> 4036.44]  There is peace on the table of the Lord.
[4036.44 --> 4042.84]  There is peace on the table of the Lord.
[4044.34 --> 4051.74]  I won't hunger anymore at this table.
[4051.74 --> 4057.64]  I will feast on the table of the Lord.
[4057.64 --> 4063.54]  There is peace on the table of the Lord.
[4063.54 --> 4068.04]  He is easy, is worthy and blind.
[4068.74 --> 4073.54]  He is able, he will restore.
[4073.54 --> 4079.44]  I will feast on the table of the Lord.
[4079.44 --> 4088.34]  There is healing on the table of the Lord.
[4088.34 --> 4093.24]  There is healing on the table of the Lord.
[4093.24 --> 4105.24]  I won't suffer anymore but he's stable
[4105.24 --> 4113.24]  Come are you weary, come are we met fine
[4113.24 --> 4119.24]  His yoke is easy, is mine and mine
[4119.24 --> 4125.24]  He is able, he will restore
[4125.24 --> 4131.24]  Come is able, all in love
[4131.24 --> 4151.24]  Are we fighting to the table of the Lord?
[4151.24 --> 4157.24]  Are we fighting to the table of the Lord?
[4157.24 --> 4167.24]  He says come just as you are at this table
[4167.24 --> 4175.24]  Come are you weary, come are we met fine
[4175.24 --> 4181.24]  His yoke is easy, is mine and mine
[4181.24 --> 4187.24]  He is able, he will restore
[4187.24 --> 4193.24]  Come is able, all in love
[4193.24 --> 4199.24]  Come is able, all in love
[4199.24 --> 4207.24]  Come is able, all in love
[4207.24 --> 4225.24]  Brothers and sisters, we come now to celebrate the Lord's Supper
[4225.24 --> 4227.24]  And this is the table of healing
[4227.24 --> 4229.24]  Our Lord Jesus Christ
[4229.24 --> 4231.24]  Who is, as we heard this morning
[4231.24 --> 4233.24]  The true and the better Elisha
[4233.24 --> 4235.24]  Has come to heal us
[4235.24 --> 4237.24]  He's healed us
[4237.24 --> 4239.24]  By healing
[4239.24 --> 4241.24]  Our relationship with God
[4241.24 --> 4243.24]  Which was broken because of sin
[4243.24 --> 4245.24]  But through Christ our Savior, through his broken body
[4245.24 --> 4247.24]  His shed blood
[4247.24 --> 4249.24]  He has reconciled us back to God
[4249.24 --> 4251.24]  But not only that
[4251.24 --> 4254.24]  This table is for the healing of the nations
[4254.24 --> 4256.24]  As we've also heard
[4256.24 --> 4258.24]  And can you picture it
[4258.24 --> 4259.24]  That first night
[4259.24 --> 4261.24]  When Jesus gave this meal
[4261.24 --> 4265.24]  There sitting at the table was a tax collector
[4265.24 --> 4269.24]  Right, someone considered a traitor to Israel
[4269.24 --> 4273.24]  And then next to him was sitting a zealot
[4273.24 --> 4277.24]  Someone committed to killing people like tax collectors
[4277.24 --> 4281.24]  And they were sitting together around this table
[4281.24 --> 4285.24]  Joined together because of Jesus Christ
[4285.24 --> 4291.24]  And so this table is for all who claim Jesus as their Savior
[4291.24 --> 4295.24]  All who have been baptized are welcome at this table
[4295.24 --> 4299.24]  And if you are still exploring the faith
[4299.24 --> 4301.24]  We are glad that you are here
[4301.24 --> 4305.24]  And we are praying for you that you would discover the beauty
[4305.24 --> 4309.24]  Of the healing of our Savior Jesus
[4309.24 --> 4311.24]  But for all of us
[4311.24 --> 4314.24]  We know that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed
[4314.24 --> 4315.24]  He took bread
[4315.24 --> 4317.24]  And when He had given thanks He broke it
[4317.24 --> 4319.24]  And said this is my body which is for you
[4319.24 --> 4321.24]  Do this in remembrance of me
[4321.24 --> 4325.24]  In the same way also He took the cup after supper
[4325.24 --> 4329.24]  Saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood
[4329.24 --> 4331.24]  As often as you drink it
[4331.24 --> 4333.24]  Do it in remembrance of me
[4333.24 --> 4335.24]  For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup
[4335.24 --> 4337.24]  You proclaim the Lord's death
[4337.24 --> 4339.24]  Until He comes again
[4339.24 --> 4341.24]  So brothers and sisters
[4341.24 --> 4345.24]  The Father is with us
[4345.24 --> 4348.24]  The Spirit is among us
[4348.24 --> 4351.24]  And Christ is here
[4351.24 --> 4353.24]  We are His people
[4353.24 --> 4355.24]  We have been redeemed by His grace
[4355.24 --> 4359.24]  And so these are the gifts of God for the people of God
[4359.24 --> 4363.24]  So let us now prepare the bread
[4363.24 --> 4365.24]  And we will eat it together
[4365.24 --> 4369.24]  So again if you just remove this top layer here
[4369.24 --> 4371.24]  It comes right off
[4371.24 --> 4389.24]  So take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you
[4389.24 --> 4403.24]  Now let us prepare the cup here
[4403.24 --> 4405.24]  And pull back the second layer
[4405.24 --> 4407.24]  Carefully
[4407.24 --> 4409.24]  Carefully
[4417.24 --> 4425.24]  So friends, take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for you for the remission of sins
[4425.24 --> 4431.24]  Let us pray together
[4431.24 --> 4433.24]  Let us pray together
[4437.24 --> 4439.24]  Our Lord Jesus Christ
[4439.24 --> 4441.24]  The great healer
[4441.24 --> 4445.24]  Lord we thank you that you have healed all that was broken
[4445.24 --> 4447.24]  You have healed our relationship with God
[4447.24 --> 4451.24]  You have healed our broken hearts, ourselves
[4451.24 --> 4453.24]  You have healed us in relationship with one another
[4453.24 --> 4455.24]  And that you are healing this world
[4457.24 --> 4459.24]  And so Father we thank you
[4459.24 --> 4461.24]  For this table and this feast
[4461.24 --> 4463.24]  This table of healing
[4463.24 --> 4465.24]  That we could celebrate, we could remember
[4465.24 --> 4467.24]  And that your grace
[4467.24 --> 4469.24]  Could be given again to us
[4469.24 --> 4471.24]  That we may follow you closely
[4471.24 --> 4473.24]  Our Lord Jesus
[4473.24 --> 4475.24]  And so Father we thank you for feeding us
[4475.24 --> 4477.24]  At this time
[4477.24 --> 4479.24]  For this time of worship together
[4479.24 --> 4481.24]  With brothers and sisters here
[4481.24 --> 4483.24]  We pray in Jesus name
[4483.24 --> 4485.24]  Amen
[4485.24 --> 4487.24]  And so we will invite Pastor Gary now to give us the benediction
[4499.24 --> 4501.24]  Arise, yes please
[4501.24 --> 4503.24]  The next day is
[4503.24 --> 4505.24]  Ernst, this is your last Sunday here right?
[4505.24 --> 4507.24]  Officially? Ernst and Winnie
[4507.24 --> 4509.24]  You probably have done this already
[4509.24 --> 4511.24]  But you know we want to send you out
[4511.24 --> 4513.24]  With God's blessing
[4513.24 --> 4515.24]  You'll be missed
[4515.24 --> 4517.24]  And I bet you'll be back
[4519.24 --> 4521.24]  So, um
[4521.24 --> 4525.24]  Receive these parting words of God's blessing
[4525.24 --> 4527.24]  The Lord bless you
[4527.24 --> 4529.24]  And keep you
[4529.24 --> 4531.24]  The Lord make his face
