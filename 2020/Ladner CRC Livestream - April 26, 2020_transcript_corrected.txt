[305.86 → 335.84] Thank you.
[335.86 → 365.84] Thank you.
[365.86 → 367.86] Thank you.
[395.86 → 401.86] Take my heart and breathe it back to life.
[402.60 → 409.24] I fall into your arms open wide.
[409.24 → 413.24] I'm a hurt and a healer.
[413.24 → 425.72] I feel it's all that I can do.
[425.72 → 431.72] Pain so deep that I can hardly leave.
[431.72 → 439.72] Just keep my eyes completely fixed on you.
[439.72 → 445.72] Lord, take hold and pull me through.
[445.72 → 447.72] Here I am.
[447.72 → 449.72] Here I am.
[449.72 → 451.72] What's left of me?
[451.72 → 457.72] Where glory meets my suffering.
[457.72 → 459.72] I'm alive.
[459.72 → 461.72] I'm alive.
[461.72 → 467.72] Even though part of me has died.
[467.72 → 473.72] Take my heart and breathe it back to life.
[473.72 → 477.72] I fall into your arms open wide.
[477.72 → 483.72] I fall into your arms open wide.
[483.72 → 487.72] When the hurt and the healer collide.
[487.72 → 512.04] BLE
[517.72 → 547.70] We'll be right back.
[547.72 → 577.70] We'll be right back.
[577.72 → 607.70] We'll be right back.
[607.72 → 637.70] We'll be right back.
[637.72 → 667.70] We'll be right back.
[667.72 → 697.70] We'll be right back.
[697.70 → 727.68] We'll be right back.
[727.70 → 757.68] We'll be right back.
[757.68 → 763.56] Wherever you are and wherever you're tuning in from, we are really glad that you are worshipping with us this morning.
[764.18 → 770.66] And today we have a guest preacher, Gary Rosema, who is the chaplain for seafarers.
[770.86 → 772.14] He will be giving the message.
[772.88 → 774.74] And today is Gems Sunday.
[775.08 → 779.50] So it's a special Sunday when we celebrate our girls' ministry.
[780.70 → 784.66] And it is unfortunate that our girls can't be here to be part of it.
[785.00 → 790.84] But we have Ellie, who is our junior counsellor, and she will be helping us with some of the parts of worship.
[791.98 → 797.56] And so let's prepare our hearts as we worship together this morning.
[797.56 → 801.06] So let's begin with a prayer. Let's pray together.
[802.14 → 812.42] Heavenly Father, the risen King, we thank you that you have gathered us this morning.
[813.16 → 817.08] Lord, we praise your name. You are the King of all creation.
[818.00 → 821.94] You are ruling all things by your providence and your care.
[823.02 → 826.42] And so Lord, we come before you this morning. We come to worship you.
[826.74 → 829.16] We thank you that you call us to worship.
[829.16 → 831.84] That you have gathered us wherever we are.
[832.18 → 841.34] That we could be here together celebrating the mystery of our union that we have with you as the body of Christ wherever we are this morning.
[842.12 → 843.16] So Lord, be with us.
[843.74 → 844.92] Help us to worship you.
[845.12 → 846.44] Help us to be present with you.
[846.96 → 848.22] We pray in Jesus' name.
[848.82 → 849.06] Amen.
[849.06 → 849.16] Amen.
[849.16 → 856.22] And now here's the call to worship.
[856.94 → 861.28] And I will read the parts that say leader and where it says all, please read along with me.
[862.78 → 864.26] So God is love.
[864.76 → 865.64] It's who he is.
[865.76 → 866.72] It's what he does.
[867.32 → 871.04] He loves us with an unfailing, unending, and unconditional love.
[871.04 → 873.56] Jesus loves me, this I know.
[874.32 → 879.66] No matter how I feel, what I've done, or what others say about me, I am loved, period.
[881.08 → 887.96] See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God, and that is what we are.
[888.90 → 893.62] When we receive God's great love and become part of his family, everything changes.
[894.28 → 896.40] We learn whose we are and who we are.
[896.82 → 898.46] We discover our true identity.
[898.46 → 904.32] We are called children of God, and that is what we are.
[912.00 → 918.00] This morning, for our songs of praise, we have chosen three songs, having the theme of rejoicing,
[918.44 → 921.34] and as we celebrate and sing of our risen Saviour.
[922.22 → 925.70] The first song is, Rejoice, the Lord is King.
[925.70 → 928.72] It was written by Charles Wesley.
[930.02 → 933.78] Charles Wesley, with his brother John, started the Methodist movement.
[935.04 → 939.34] Early Methodists were persecuted and lived lives of hardship.
[940.44 → 943.02] But Charles Wesley wanted to encourage his followers.
[943.94 → 949.32] He wanted them to be a singing, joyful people, and not get discouraged and lose hope.
[949.32 → 956.56] Paul's letter to the Philippians gave Wesley the text for Rejoice, the Lord is King.
[956.56 → 977.90] Rejoice, the Lord is King, your Lord and King adore.
[977.90 → 986.08] Rejoice, give thanks and sing and triumph evermore.
[986.08 → 992.40] Lift your heart, lift your voice.
[992.54 → 997.04] Rejoice again, I say rejoice.
[997.04 → 998.50] Rejoice.
[998.50 → 1003.86] His kingdom cannot fail.
[1003.86 → 1007.56] He rules o'er earth and heaven.
[1007.56 → 1015.36] The keys of death and hell to Christ the Lord are given.
[1015.36 → 1022.04] Lift your heart, lift your voice.
[1022.04 → 1029.04] Rejoice again, I say rejoice.
[1029.04 → 1030.04] Rejoice.
[1030.04 → 1038.28] Rejoice in glorious hope for Christ the judge shall come
[1038.28 → 1046.04] to gather all his saints to their eternal home.
[1046.04 → 1052.86] We soon shall hear the archangel's voice.
[1052.86 → 1056.42] The trump of God shall come.
[1057.04 → 1058.04] Rejoice.
[1065.04 → 1071.26] Our next song, Come, People of the Ridden King, continues the theme of rejoicing.
[1071.26 → 1078.26] It's a contemporary song written by Keith and Kirsten Getty in 2009.
[1078.26 → 1083.26] As Paul says in Philippians 4, Rejoice in the Lord always.
[1083.26 → 1085.26] I will say it again, rejoice.
[1085.26 → 1089.26] Let your gentleness be evident to all.
[1089.26 → 1090.26] The Lord is near.
[1090.26 → 1093.26] Do not be anxious about anything.
[1093.26 → 1100.26] But in every situation, with prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your request to God.
[1100.26 → 1109.26] And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[1109.26 → 1116.26] Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise.
[1116.26 → 1133.26] Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise.
[1133.26 → 1141.26] Come, all, and tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[1141.26 → 1150.26] From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to Him.
[1150.26 → 1159.26] Where steady streams of mercy reach, to gather children in.
[1159.26 → 1160.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1160.26 → 1161.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1161.26 → 1166.26] Let every tongue rejoice.
[1166.26 → 1177.26] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1177.26 → 1195.26] Come, those who tell of battle's won, and those struggling in the fight.
[1195.26 → 1204.26] For His perfect love will never change, and His mercies never cease.
[1204.26 → 1212.26] But follow us through all our days, with a certain hope of peace.
[1212.26 → 1213.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1213.26 → 1214.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1214.26 → 1217.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1217.26 → 1220.26] Let every tongue rejoice.
[1220.26 → 1230.26] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1230.26 → 1240.26] Come, young and old, from every land, men and women of the faith.
[1240.26 → 1249.26] Come, those with full or empty hands, by the riches of His grace.
[1249.26 → 1258.26] Over all the world His people sing, sure to sure we hear them call.
[1258.26 → 1267.26] The truth that drives through every age, our God is coming in all.
[1267.26 → 1268.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1268.26 → 1269.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1269.26 → 1270.26] Rejoice, rejoice.
[1270.26 → 1275.26] Let every tongue rejoice.
[1275.26 → 1288.26] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1288.26 → 1294.26] Our final praise song is probably the most well-known of this morning's three songs.
[1294.26 → 1297.26] I serve a risen Saviour.
[1297.26 → 1303.26] It was written by a Presbyterian minister, Alfred Ackley, in 1887.
[1303.26 → 1306.26] He was once asked a question,
[1306.26 → 1310.26] Why should I worship a dead Jewish person?
[1310.26 → 1313.26] To which Ackley emphatically replied,
[1313.26 → 1315.26] But Jesus lives!
[1315.26 → 1317.26] He lives, I tell you!
[1317.26 → 1320.26] He is not dead, but lives here and now.
[1320.26 → 1326.26] Jesus Christ is more alive today than ever before.
[1326.26 → 1333.26] I can prove it by my own experience, as well as a testimony of countless thousands.
[1333.26 → 1335.26] Today, we know it is true.
[1335.26 → 1336.26] Jesus lives.
[1336.26 → 1339.26] He lives within our hearts.
[1339.26 → 1360.26] I serve a risen Saviour.
[1360.26 → 1364.78] He's a Saviour, He's in the world today.
[1365.30 → 1371.16] I know that He is living, whatever people say.
[1372.18 → 1378.58] I hear His hands of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer.
[1379.04 → 1385.44] And every time I meet Him, He's always near.
[1385.44 → 1391.76] He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today.
[1392.74 → 1399.56] He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
[1399.90 → 1405.94] He lives, He lives, He lives, salvation to impart.
[1407.52 → 1412.48] You ask me how I know He lives.
[1412.48 → 1419.60] He lives within my heart.
[1421.22 → 1427.98] Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, lift your voice and sing.
[1428.42 → 1434.48] Eternal hallelujah to Jesus Christ the King.
[1434.48 → 1441.98] The hope of all who seek Him, the help of all who find.
[1442.50 → 1448.48] No other is so loving, so good and kind.
[1449.54 → 1455.26] He lives, He lives, He lives as Jesus lives today.
[1455.26 → 1463.34] He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
[1463.34 → 1469.82] He lives, He lives, He lives, salvation to impart.
[1471.50 → 1477.40] You ask me how I know He lives.
[1477.40 → 1485.64] He lives within my heart.
[1485.64 → 1500.70] And now let us continue to worship in a time of...
[1500.70 → 1514.10] We confess that we look for our identity, our roles or reputation, weakness or strengths, achievements or appearances, or what we own or do.
[1515.14 → 1518.24] But our true and new identity is found in Christ.
[1518.24 → 1526.20] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come, the old has gone, the new is here.
[1527.24 → 1532.60] In Jesus, we are accepted, beautiful, forgiven, and loved.
[1532.60 → 1538.48] When we remember who we really are in Jesus, we will live loved.
[1538.76 → 1543.34] From the fullness of God's love, we will love Him, ourselves, and others.
[1544.28 → 1547.50] Gracious God, thank you for your great love for us.
[1548.28 → 1556.50] Give us the power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Jesus, so we can live loved.
[1556.50 → 1562.18] Through your love for us, may the world come to know that Jesus loves them too.
[1562.90 → 1564.76] In His life-changing name we pray.
[1565.42 → 1565.70] Amen.
[1565.70 → 1565.86] Amen.
[1586.50 → 1606.78] Jesus is born of all the earth.
[1606.78 → 1612.48] He is the King of creation.
[1612.48 → 1642.46] Jesus is born of all the earth.
[1642.48 → 1649.26] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, give thanks to the risen Lord.
[1649.56 → 1657.20] Alleluia, alleluia, give praise to His name.
[1657.20 → 1658.36] Amen.
[1659.70 → 1660.72] Amen.
[1663.42 → 1664.62] Amen.
[1664.62 → 1665.34] Amen.
[1665.78 → 1668.58] Amen.
[1668.58 → 1669.74] Amen.
[1669.74 → 1672.04] Amen.
[1672.48 → 1679.28] Alleluia, give thanks to the risen Lord
[1679.28 → 1688.46] Alleluia, Alleluia, give praise to His name
[1697.16 → 1699.76] Thank you for leading us in worship
[1699.76 → 1704.02] And again, it's a pleasure to be here for me
[1704.02 → 1710.20] And to be here in this sort of interesting way
[1710.20 → 1715.16] But still to know that we are gathered as God's people at this time
[1715.16 → 1720.08] I wanted to start by sharing a little bit about what's happening in the port
[1720.08 → 1721.50] As you may be wondering
[1721.50 → 1727.04] Because we continue to do ministry in sort of interesting ways
[1727.04 → 1728.84] Our seafarer centres are closed
[1728.84 → 1732.72] We don't use the vans to transport seafarers around anymore
[1732.72 → 1735.64] Most of them are locked on their ships
[1735.64 → 1737.36] They are not allowed shore leave
[1737.36 → 1741.28] But we are still going to visit in unique ways
[1741.28 → 1742.60] If you could put up the first slide
[1742.60 → 1749.44] This is a slide from about a week ago
[1749.44 → 1750.46] A little over a week ago
[1750.46 → 1755.50] We were called by the Philippines consulate
[1755.50 → 1758.74] Over a case where a number of seafarers
[1758.74 → 1761.86] And this underlies an issue that's becoming more and more prevalent
[1761.86 → 1764.96] Seafarers are coming to the end of their contract
[1764.96 → 1766.90] But they can't go home
[1766.90 → 1768.68] They can't get a flight
[1768.68 → 1770.74] They can't get out of this
[1770.74 → 1773.46] The country that they're wanting to leave from
[1773.46 → 1775.60] And they maybe can't even get into their own country
[1775.60 → 1777.20] So it's creating all kinds of issues
[1777.20 → 1779.48] And seafarers are having to extend their contracts
[1779.48 → 1781.40] On this particular ship
[1781.40 → 1783.40] There were a dozen seafarers
[1783.40 → 1787.30] Who were due to finish their contracts
[1787.30 → 1788.74] And they wanted to
[1788.74 → 1790.76] And there became an international issue
[1790.76 → 1792.26] Between the embassy of the US
[1792.26 → 1793.18] Or Canada
[1793.18 → 1794.84] And the Philippine embassy
[1794.84 → 1796.78] Eventually a consulate locally here
[1796.78 → 1798.00] Contacted us
[1798.00 → 1801.04] Eleven of the guys ended up just extending their contracts
[1801.04 → 1803.76] One, the chief officer insisted on going back
[1803.76 → 1807.42] Nonetheless, the consulate sent a dozen
[1807.42 → 1809.04] And you can just see them along the bottom
[1809.04 → 1812.24] Of these care packages for the seafarers
[1812.24 → 1814.28] And they asked us to deliver them
[1814.28 → 1816.10] So Peter in the back there
[1816.10 → 1816.82] And myself
[1816.82 → 1818.80] We brought these on
[1818.80 → 1821.64] We just met them at the bottom of the gangway there
[1821.64 → 1823.56] Later a bigger crowd joined
[1823.56 → 1826.16] And we were able to deliver that
[1826.16 → 1827.58] Say a prayer with the guys
[1827.58 → 1829.02] Encourage them in that way
[1829.02 → 1831.96] And so it was a neat little ministry
[1831.96 → 1833.08] That we could be part of
[1833.08 → 1834.46] The next slide
[1834.46 → 1836.28] A couple of weeks ago
[1836.28 → 1836.94] On a Saturday
[1836.94 → 1838.86] I was on board a ship
[1838.86 → 1839.42] I boarded
[1839.42 → 1840.58] And I just said
[1840.58 → 1841.50] How are things going?
[1841.76 → 1842.98] And yeah, everything's okay
[1842.98 → 1843.46] Except
[1843.46 → 1845.90] We don't have Wi-Fi
[1845.90 → 1847.14] Do you have any way
[1847.14 → 1848.30] To get us connected
[1848.30 → 1850.74] To the internet
[1850.74 → 1852.84] So that we can at least contact our families?
[1853.16 → 1853.88] So I said
[1853.88 → 1854.90] Well I could maybe help
[1854.90 → 1856.50] And I gave them a quick
[1856.50 → 1858.20] One of those Fido
[1858.20 → 1861.66] One hour free hot spots
[1861.66 → 1862.48] That you can give
[1862.48 → 1863.52] You get five a month
[1863.52 → 1864.28] If you're on Fido
[1864.28 → 1865.82] Everybody go and join Fido now
[1865.82 → 1867.04] That's my ad for Fido
[1867.04 → 1869.34] Anyway, so I had this
[1869.34 → 1871.00] I said
[1871.00 → 1871.82] I can set you up
[1871.82 → 1873.58] And, so I hooked up my phone
[1873.58 → 1874.56] And next thing I know
[1874.56 → 1875.88] I had four or five guys there
[1875.88 → 1877.20] And they're all on their gadgets
[1877.20 → 1879.06] And they were happily connecting
[1879.06 → 1880.24] One of them
[1880.24 → 1881.18] Actually
[1881.18 → 1882.66] Started chatting
[1882.66 → 1884.18] On his phone
[1884.18 → 1885.66] To his parents
[1885.66 → 1886.60] It became evident
[1886.60 → 1887.94] And I said
[1887.94 → 1888.64] Wait a minute
[1888.64 → 1892.40] Considering what time it is here
[1892.40 → 1893.26] This is midday
[1893.26 → 1894.32] I know it's about
[1894.32 → 1895.86] Two or three a.m.
[1896.20 → 1897.02] In the Philippines
[1897.02 → 1898.30] Are your parents
[1898.30 → 1899.28] Actually awake
[1899.28 → 1900.16] And chatting with you
[1900.16 → 1900.82] Right now?
[1901.36 → 1902.60] And he said to me
[1902.60 → 1902.88] He said
[1902.88 → 1903.28] Well
[1903.28 → 1904.48] No
[1904.48 → 1905.72] They're not
[1905.72 → 1906.78] This is my parents
[1906.78 → 1908.10] But they're not in
[1908.10 → 1908.84] The Philippines
[1908.84 → 1909.76] In fact
[1909.76 → 1910.76] And what was interesting
[1910.76 → 1912.10] Was here was a seafarer
[1912.10 → 1912.96] From the Philippines
[1912.96 → 1914.34] In Vancouver
[1914.34 → 1916.12] Chatting with his parents
[1916.12 → 1917.18] From the Philippines
[1917.18 → 1919.36] Who were working in Qatar
[1919.36 → 1920.08] Doha
[1920.08 → 1922.92] And so he was chatting away
[1922.92 → 1924.26] And he showed me
[1924.26 → 1924.86] And I said
[1924.86 → 1925.44] Hi mom
[1925.44 → 1926.00] Hi dad
[1926.00 → 1927.32] I was older than both of them
[1927.32 → 1928.68] But I said it anyway
[1928.68 → 1930.24] And we met
[1930.24 → 1932.54] And what a beautiful time
[1932.54 → 1933.36] What an opportunity
[1933.36 → 1934.50] Now unfortunately
[1934.50 → 1935.26] The
[1935.26 → 1937.48] My battery died
[1937.48 → 1938.22] My phone died
[1938.22 → 1939.20] Before the hour ended
[1939.20 → 1940.54] But I came back later
[1940.54 → 1941.76] With a bunch of
[1941.76 → 1942.56] SIM cards
[1942.56 → 1943.18] That they could put
[1943.18 → 1944.14] In their own phones
[1944.14 → 1945.22] And
[1945.22 → 1946.56] And top-ups
[1946.56 → 1947.14] And connections
[1947.14 → 1948.04] And it ended up
[1948.04 → 1948.78] Being a great time
[1948.78 → 1949.00] For them
[1949.00 → 1949.50] They were thrilled
[1949.50 → 1950.18] In fact the next day
[1950.18 → 1951.44] They called for even more
[1951.44 → 1952.30] To come
[1952.30 → 1953.74] And receive those
[1953.74 → 1954.66] And we've been doing
[1954.66 → 1955.50] A lot of that
[1955.50 → 1956.46] Serving seafarers
[1956.46 → 1956.96] In that way
[1956.96 → 1958.70] We continue to meet
[1958.70 → 1959.12] With them
[1959.12 → 1960.66] Again at a distance
[1960.66 → 1961.82] Just at the gangway
[1961.82 → 1963.22] But it's an opportunity
[1963.22 → 1964.18] To serve them
[1964.18 → 1965.32] In a variety of ways
[1965.32 → 1966.66] So ministry does continue
[1966.66 → 1968.16] And thank you
[1968.16 → 1968.82] For your prayers
[1968.82 → 1970.10] And support
[1970.10 → 1971.64] In so many ways
[1971.64 → 1972.80] So appreciate that
[1972.80 → 1973.96] Let's begin with
[1973.96 → 1974.62] A word of prayer
[1974.62 → 1976.48] As we turn to
[1976.48 → 1977.26] God's word
[1977.26 → 1980.42] Heavenly Father
[1980.42 → 1983.00] We do thank you
[1983.00 → 1985.10] For opportunities
[1985.10 → 1986.04] To serve
[1986.04 → 1987.76] And to worship
[1987.76 → 1990.08] Even in the midst
[1990.08 → 1991.02] Of
[1991.02 → 1994.28] Unusual situations
[1994.28 → 1995.56] Like we find ourselves
[1995.56 → 1996.08] In now
[1996.08 → 1998.36] Lord guide
[1998.36 → 1999.24] In our worship
[1999.24 → 1999.26] In our worship
[1999.26 → 1999.64] Now
[1999.64 → 2001.80] And particularly
[2001.80 → 2002.68] As we
[2002.68 → 2004.96] Look into your word
[2004.96 → 2007.34] Direct our lives
[2007.34 → 2009.94] Change our hearts
[2009.94 → 2012.18] Through the powerful work
[2012.18 → 2012.98] Of your spirit
[2012.98 → 2014.58] The spirit of Jesus Christ
[2014.58 → 2016.06] And we ask it
[2016.06 → 2016.72] In his name
[2016.72 → 2018.10] Amen
[2018.10 → 2021.22] Before we turn
[2021.22 → 2022.14] To the passage
[2022.14 → 2023.36] I want to give
[2023.36 → 2024.10] A little word
[2024.10 → 2025.74] Of introduction
[2025.74 → 2028.46] This has been
[2028.46 → 2029.64] These have been
[2029.64 → 2030.50] Challenging times
[2030.50 → 2031.26] These past
[2031.26 → 2032.46] Weeks
[2032.46 → 2035.18] But particularly
[2035.18 → 2036.08] I was struck
[2036.08 → 2036.54] I was actually
[2036.54 → 2036.96] Going to preach
[2036.96 → 2037.64] Another sermon
[2037.64 → 2038.64] And then
[2038.64 → 2040.14] Last weekend's
[2040.14 → 2041.12] Tragic
[2041.12 → 2042.00] Shooting
[2042.00 → 2044.14] In Nova Scotia
[2044.14 → 2045.08] Really
[2045.08 → 2046.84] Struck me
[2046.84 → 2048.00] In
[2048.00 → 2049.34] In a powerful way
[2049.34 → 2050.50] And it made me
[2050.50 → 2051.94] Think a lot
[2051.94 → 2052.48] And I've been
[2052.48 → 2053.16] Wrestling
[2053.16 → 2055.64] Over that whole issue
[2055.64 → 2056.34] Now there's a lot
[2056.34 → 2057.10] We could think about
[2057.10 → 2057.90] And I'm not going to
[2057.90 → 2059.10] Unwrap nearly
[2059.10 → 2059.82] All of that
[2059.82 → 2060.54] But one
[2060.54 → 2062.18] Point in particular
[2062.18 → 2063.08] Struck me
[2063.08 → 2066.44] Right after
[2066.44 → 2067.22] That happened
[2067.22 → 2067.98] And there was
[2067.98 → 2068.90] Meetings
[2068.90 → 2069.28] And there was
[2069.28 → 2070.26] News about it
[2070.26 → 2071.52] But we were
[2071.52 → 2072.26] Asked
[2072.26 → 2073.12] As a people
[2073.12 → 2074.70] To not
[2074.70 → 2075.56] Mention
[2075.56 → 2076.72] The name
[2076.72 → 2078.44] Of the perpetrator
[2078.44 → 2080.58] And the media
[2080.58 → 2081.20] Was asked
[2081.20 → 2082.24] Don't
[2082.24 → 2083.10] Mention
[2083.10 → 2084.78] His name
[2084.78 → 2087.44] And I was
[2087.44 → 2088.40] Struck by that
[2088.40 → 2088.90] Because I've
[2088.90 → 2089.36] Heard that
[2089.36 → 2090.60] At other times
[2090.60 → 2090.84] Too
[2090.84 → 2091.36] And in other
[2091.36 → 2091.78] Kinds of
[2091.78 → 2092.26] Situation
[2092.26 → 2093.50] Let's not
[2093.50 → 2093.94] Even
[2093.94 → 2094.86] Name
[2094.86 → 2095.82] The person
[2095.82 → 2097.84] And it
[2097.84 → 2098.22] Had me
[2098.22 → 2098.64] Thinking
[2098.64 → 2100.04] Why do
[2100.04 → 2100.54] We say
[2100.54 → 2100.96] That
[2100.96 → 2103.52] Is that
[2103.52 → 2103.92] Really
[2103.92 → 2104.70] The right
[2104.70 → 2105.04] Thing to
[2105.04 → 2105.28] Do
[2105.28 → 2108.44] The fact
[2108.44 → 2108.84] Of the matter
[2108.84 → 2109.28] Is
[2109.28 → 2110.42] We still
[2110.42 → 2110.84] Name him
[2110.84 → 2111.98] It's
[2111.98 → 2112.92] Unavoidable
[2112.92 → 2114.72] The news
[2114.72 → 2115.24] Does
[2115.24 → 2116.24] And
[2116.24 → 2117.22] We want
[2117.22 → 2117.90] To know
[2117.90 → 2120.10] What was
[2120.10 → 2120.88] Behind this
[2120.88 → 2122.26] Who was
[2122.26 → 2123.00] This person
[2123.00 → 2124.46] Why
[2124.46 → 2125.30] Would he
[2125.30 → 2125.56] Do
[2125.56 → 2126.38] Something
[2126.38 → 2127.92] As heinous
[2127.92 → 2128.26] As what
[2128.26 → 2128.62] He did
[2128.62 → 2130.96] So we
[2130.96 → 2131.48] We almost
[2131.48 → 2132.24] Demand
[2132.24 → 2133.02] To know
[2133.02 → 2133.66] And it
[2133.66 → 2134.44] Is almost
[2134.44 → 2135.10] Unavoidable
[2135.10 → 2137.00] But there
[2137.00 → 2137.30] Is
[2137.30 → 2137.72] There are
[2137.72 → 2138.14] Reasons
[2138.14 → 2138.46] Given
[2138.46 → 2139.92] For not
[2139.92 → 2141.12] Mentioning
[2141.12 → 2141.68] Or not
[2141.68 → 2142.40] Overly
[2142.40 → 2142.86] Mentioning
[2142.86 → 2143.34] His name
[2143.34 → 2144.50] Don't
[2144.50 → 2145.04] Give him
[2145.04 → 2146.18] The infamy
[2146.18 → 2146.94] That he
[2146.94 → 2147.56] Does not
[2147.56 → 2148.24] Deserve
[2148.24 → 2150.42] He doesn't
[2150.42 → 2150.66] Deserve
[2150.66 → 2151.00] That kind
[2151.00 → 2151.38] Of fame
[2151.38 → 2152.52] Almost
[2152.52 → 2153.28] Glory
[2153.28 → 2154.08] Of his
[2154.08 → 2154.40] Name
[2154.40 → 2155.94] And others
[2155.94 → 2156.76] I've chatted
[2156.76 → 2157.42] With a few
[2157.42 → 2158.02] People about
[2158.02 → 2158.28] This
[2158.28 → 2158.92] Have said
[2158.92 → 2159.44] Yeah
[2159.44 → 2159.74] And the
[2159.74 → 2159.96] Other
[2159.96 → 2160.78] Concern
[2160.78 → 2161.16] Is what
[2161.16 → 2161.44] About
[2161.44 → 2162.82] Unfortunately
[2162.82 → 2163.92] Copycats
[2163.92 → 2165.34] Somebody who
[2165.34 → 2166.30] Sees him
[2166.30 → 2166.76] Getting his
[2166.76 → 2167.08] Name in
[2167.08 → 2167.50] The lights
[2167.50 → 2168.24] And in
[2168.24 → 2169.98] A horrible
[2169.98 → 2170.62] Sort of way
[2170.62 → 2171.24] Says I want
[2171.24 → 2171.68] To get my
[2171.68 → 2172.04] Name in
[2172.04 → 2172.42] The lights
[2172.42 → 2173.02] Like that
[2173.02 → 2173.84] Hopefully
[2173.84 → 2174.42] That won't
[2174.42 → 2174.94] Happen
[2174.94 → 2176.14] But there's
[2176.14 → 2176.60] Always that
[2176.60 → 2177.12] Concern
[2177.12 → 2178.30] And so
[2178.30 → 2179.26] Avoid even
[2179.26 → 2179.98] Mentioning
[2179.98 → 2180.94] The name
[2180.94 → 2182.38] But I
[2182.38 → 2182.98] Think there's
[2182.98 → 2183.90] Something else
[2183.90 → 2184.70] Going on
[2184.70 → 2185.26] Here as
[2185.26 → 2185.50] Well
[2185.50 → 2187.28] And
[2187.28 → 2188.20] What I
[2188.20 → 2189.34] Sense
[2189.34 → 2189.78] Is going
[2189.78 → 2190.04] On
[2190.04 → 2190.44] Because I
[2190.44 → 2190.98] Hear this
[2190.98 → 2191.74] In other
[2191.74 → 2192.60] Contexts
[2192.60 → 2193.88] Is what
[2193.88 → 2194.36] I'll refer
[2194.36 → 2194.92] To as
[2194.92 → 2195.40] In light
[2195.40 → 2195.86] Of what
[2195.86 → 2196.02] We're
[2196.02 → 2196.60] Talking about
[2196.60 → 2197.32] In midst
[2197.32 → 2198.28] Of COVID-19
[2198.28 → 2199.74] Physical
[2199.74 → 2200.88] Distancing
[2200.88 → 2203.78] I call
[2203.78 → 2204.22] This
[2204.22 → 2205.90] Moral
[2205.90 → 2207.16] Distancing
[2207.16 → 2210.14] There's a
[2210.14 → 2210.52] Sense
[2210.52 → 2211.42] In which
[2211.42 → 2212.62] We look
[2212.62 → 2212.98] At a
[2212.98 → 2213.44] Person
[2213.44 → 2214.24] Like that
[2214.24 → 2216.32] And we
[2216.32 → 2216.76] Hear
[2216.76 → 2217.58] Comments
[2217.58 → 2217.94] Like
[2217.94 → 2220.28] We're not
[2220.28 → 2221.02] Like that
[2221.02 → 2223.42] That's
[2223.42 → 2223.78] Not
[2223.78 → 2224.26] What
[2224.26 → 2225.12] Canadians
[2225.12 → 2225.66] Are like
[2225.66 → 2226.04] That's
[2226.04 → 2226.34] Not
[2226.34 → 2226.86] Who
[2226.86 → 2227.66] Canadians
[2227.66 → 2228.52] Are
[2228.52 → 2231.12] Some
[2231.12 → 2231.50] People
[2231.50 → 2232.08] Are
[2232.08 → 2232.56] A few
[2232.56 → 2234.96] But not
[2234.96 → 2235.38] Us
[2235.38 → 2237.00] Not use
[2237.00 → 2237.80] Good
[2237.80 → 2238.84] Canadians
[2238.84 → 2241.38] We're not
[2241.38 → 2242.32] Like that
[2242.32 → 2244.02] Secular
[2244.02 → 2244.66] Sort of
[2244.66 → 2245.80] Humanism
[2245.80 → 2246.76] Is big
[2246.76 → 2247.22] Into this
[2247.22 → 2248.38] This optimistic
[2248.38 → 2249.26] View of
[2249.26 → 2250.16] Humanity
[2250.16 → 2250.62] Improving
[2250.62 → 2250.96] And so
[2250.96 → 2251.66] We want
[2251.66 → 2251.98] To kind
[2251.98 → 2252.10] Of
[2252.10 → 2253.02] Separate
[2253.02 → 2253.62] Ourselves
[2253.62 → 2254.12] From
[2254.12 → 2255.04] The ones
[2255.04 → 2255.94] The few
[2255.94 → 2256.50] Who are
[2256.50 → 2257.06] Like that
[2257.06 → 2257.50] But
[2257.50 → 2259.08] Generally
[2259.08 → 2259.68] Speaking
[2259.68 → 2260.54] People
[2260.54 → 2262.34] Are good
[2262.34 → 2263.06] And we're
[2263.06 → 2263.52] Moving in
[2263.52 → 2263.96] The right
[2263.96 → 2264.48] Direction
[2264.48 → 2265.34] And so
[2265.34 → 2266.30] We morally
[2266.30 → 2267.10] Distance
[2267.10 → 2267.72] Ourselves
[2267.72 → 2268.54] From
[2268.54 → 2269.18] Someone
[2269.18 → 2270.06] Like that
[2270.06 → 2270.64] A person
[2270.64 → 2271.16] Who does
[2271.16 → 2272.42] That sort
[2272.42 → 2272.90] Of thing
[2272.90 → 2276.90] It's
[2276.90 → 2277.22] Almost
[2277.22 → 2278.30] Like
[2278.30 → 2279.24] In some
[2279.24 → 2279.46] Ways
[2279.46 → 2279.78] How we
[2279.78 → 2280.12] Deal with
[2280.12 → 2280.46] Death
[2280.46 → 2281.00] Today
[2281.00 → 2281.82] In our
[2281.82 → 2282.34] Culture
[2282.34 → 2282.60] We
[2282.60 → 2284.14] Sterilize
[2284.14 → 2284.26] It
[2284.26 → 2284.66] We keep
[2284.66 → 2284.82] It
[2284.82 → 2285.58] As far
[2285.58 → 2285.92] Away as
[2285.92 → 2286.36] Possible
[2286.36 → 2287.30] For as
[2287.30 → 2287.84] Long
[2287.84 → 2288.38] As
[2288.38 → 2289.06] Possible
[2289.06 → 2291.22] Distancing
[2291.22 → 2292.04] Ourselves
[2292.04 → 2292.98] From the
[2292.98 → 2293.68] Perpetrator
[2293.68 → 2294.28] Or
[2294.28 → 2295.08] Perpetrators
[2295.08 → 2297.28] Well
[2297.28 → 2297.90] Scripture
[2297.90 → 2299.20] As I
[2299.20 → 2299.34] Was
[2299.34 → 2299.90] Reflecting
[2299.90 → 2300.42] On this
[2300.42 → 2302.38] Scripture
[2302.38 → 2303.68] Never
[2303.68 → 2304.92] Hesitates
[2304.92 → 2305.92] To name
[2305.92 → 2306.54] The
[2306.54 → 2307.02] Sinners
[2307.02 → 2307.62] Have you
[2307.62 → 2307.84] Notice
[2307.84 → 2308.12] That
[2308.12 → 2310.48] Right
[2310.48 → 2311.14] From the
[2311.14 → 2311.58] Get
[2311.58 → 2311.98] Go
[2311.98 → 2313.86] Adam
[2313.86 → 2315.48] And Eve
[2315.48 → 2317.44] And then
[2317.44 → 2318.26] The story
[2318.26 → 2319.04] Just carries
[2319.04 → 2319.50] On
[2319.50 → 2319.68] And
[2319.68 → 2321.08] Cain
[2321.08 → 2322.56] Lame ch
[2322.56 → 2325.20] Joseph's
[2325.20 → 2326.02] Brothers
[2326.02 → 2328.16] Eli's
[2328.16 → 2329.08] Sons
[2329.08 → 2331.82] King
[2331.82 → 2332.66] David
[2332.66 → 2335.46] And so
[2335.46 → 2336.04] Many
[2336.04 → 2336.60] Other
[2336.60 → 2337.18] Kings
[2337.18 → 2337.86] Who follow
[2337.86 → 2338.64] After him
[2338.64 → 2339.42] And there
[2339.42 → 2339.80] Are just
[2339.80 → 2340.68] These stories
[2340.68 → 2342.20] After stories
[2342.20 → 2343.34] After stories
[2343.34 → 2344.00] Of these
[2344.00 → 2345.38] These people
[2345.38 → 2346.92] Named people
[2346.92 → 2348.42] Who fail
[2348.42 → 2349.64] Who rebel
[2349.64 → 2351.08] Against God
[2351.08 → 2352.78] And the Bible
[2352.78 → 2354.04] Does not shy
[2354.04 → 2354.64] Away from that
[2354.64 → 2355.18] I was struck
[2355.18 → 2355.72] By that
[2355.72 → 2357.30] It names
[2357.30 → 2358.88] The individuals
[2358.88 → 2359.38] Even
[2359.38 → 2360.20] At times
[2360.20 → 2362.08] In fact
[2362.08 → 2363.06] Biblical
[2363.06 → 2363.70] Hebrew
[2363.70 → 2364.60] Has one
[2364.60 → 2364.88] Of the
[2364.88 → 2365.76] Richest
[2365.76 → 2367.12] Vocabularies
[2367.12 → 2367.42] Of any
[2367.42 → 2367.98] Language
[2367.98 → 2369.24] For sin
[2369.24 → 2371.02] Rebellion
[2371.02 → 2372.40] Wickedness
[2372.40 → 2373.48] Iniquity
[2373.48 → 2374.54] Transgression
[2374.54 → 2375.06] And it has
[2375.06 → 2375.98] All of these
[2375.98 → 2376.40] Terms that
[2376.40 → 2376.80] We kind of
[2376.80 → 2377.80] Struggle to
[2377.80 → 2378.84] Find English
[2378.84 → 2379.52] Equivalence
[2379.52 → 2380.08] Or in many
[2380.08 → 2380.86] Other languages
[2380.86 → 2382.00] Some people
[2382.00 → 2382.54] Would see
[2382.54 → 2382.96] That as
[2382.96 → 2383.64] As an
[2383.64 → 2384.40] Unhealthy
[2384.40 → 2385.58] Preoccupation
[2385.58 → 2385.88] Almost
[2385.88 → 2386.86] Obsession
[2386.86 → 2387.56] But I
[2387.56 → 2387.94] Don't think
[2387.94 → 2388.26] So
[2388.26 → 2390.06] They
[2390.06 → 2391.34] Understood
[2391.34 → 2391.94] And
[2391.94 → 2393.02] Recognized
[2393.02 → 2393.86] That before
[2393.86 → 2394.74] A holy
[2394.74 → 2395.64] God
[2395.64 → 2397.14] We are
[2397.14 → 2398.36] A fallen
[2398.36 → 2399.64] People
[2399.64 → 2402.48] The New
[2402.48 → 2402.80] Testament
[2402.80 → 2403.42] Carries it
[2403.42 → 2403.68] On
[2403.68 → 2405.44] Herod
[2405.44 → 2407.64] Judas
[2407.64 → 2408.44] Iscariot
[2408.44 → 2410.46] Peter
[2410.46 → 2411.48] The Christ
[2411.48 → 2412.34] Denier
[2412.34 → 2415.72] Those who
[2415.72 → 2416.40] Were at
[2416.40 → 2416.72] Times
[2416.72 → 2417.44] Troubling
[2417.44 → 2418.10] Paul
[2418.10 → 2418.72] In his
[2418.72 → 2419.30] Ministry
[2419.30 → 2420.08] And you
[2420.08 → 2420.40] Can think
[2420.40 → 2420.74] Of others
[2420.74 → 2422.04] It names
[2422.04 → 2423.58] The individuals
[2423.58 → 2424.62] Quite often
[2424.62 → 2427.94] And that
[2427.94 → 2428.40] Leads us
[2428.40 → 2428.74] To our
[2428.74 → 2429.18] Text
[2429.18 → 2429.98] For today
[2429.98 → 2431.42] The text
[2431.42 → 2432.14] Is from
[2432.14 → 2432.70] First
[2432.70 → 2433.36] Timothy
[2433.36 → 2434.76] Chapter
[2434.76 → 2435.42] One
[2435.42 → 2437.78] First
[2437.78 → 2438.22] Timothy
[2438.22 → 2439.40] Chapter
[2439.40 → 2439.82] One
[2439.82 → 2440.48] And I
[2440.48 → 2440.64] Want to
[2440.64 → 2441.02] Begin
[2441.02 → 2441.58] Reading
[2441.58 → 2442.02] At
[2442.02 → 2442.40] Verse
[2442.40 → 2442.84] Eight
[2442.84 → 2443.92] Paul
[2443.92 → 2444.24] Here
[2444.24 → 2444.42] The
[2444.42 → 2444.92] Apostle
[2444.92 → 2445.16] Paul
[2445.16 → 2445.60] Writing
[2445.60 → 2446.56] To
[2446.56 → 2447.30] His
[2447.30 → 2447.96] Son
[2447.96 → 2448.42] In the
[2448.42 → 2448.84] Faith
[2448.84 → 2449.28] As he
[2449.28 → 2449.66] Refers
[2449.66 → 2450.14] To him
[2450.14 → 2450.88] Timothy
[2450.88 → 2452.82] A letter
[2452.82 → 2453.20] Of
[2453.20 → 2454.92] Advice
[2454.92 → 2456.34] Encouragement
[2456.34 → 2457.70] As
[2457.70 → 2458.24] Timothy
[2458.24 → 2459.30] Is
[2459.30 → 2460.30] Ministering
[2460.30 → 2461.04] Pastoring
[2461.04 → 2461.80] The church
[2461.80 → 2462.68] At Ephesus
[2462.68 → 2464.48] And
[2464.48 → 2465.12] Unfortunately
[2465.12 → 2465.92] As Paul
[2465.92 → 2466.62] Had predicted
[2466.62 → 2467.10] Earlier
[2467.10 → 2467.92] There have
[2467.92 → 2468.58] Been some
[2468.58 → 2469.52] Voices
[2469.52 → 2470.06] Come into
[2470.06 → 2470.60] The midst
[2470.60 → 2471.20] Of the
[2471.20 → 2472.02] Situation
[2472.02 → 2472.60] In the
[2472.60 → 2472.88] Church
[2472.88 → 2473.68] At Ephesus
[2473.68 → 2474.90] Who are
[2474.90 → 2476.20] Causing
[2476.20 → 2477.14] Problems
[2477.14 → 2477.52] Causing
[2477.52 → 2478.06] Trouble
[2478.06 → 2478.98] False
[2478.98 → 2479.58] Teaching
[2479.58 → 2480.18] Or
[2480.18 → 2481.34] Divergent
[2481.34 → 2481.84] Teaching
[2481.84 → 2482.22] Of
[2482.22 → 2482.46] Some
[2482.46 → 2482.82] Sort
[2482.82 → 2483.82] And so
[2483.82 → 2484.12] He's
[2484.12 → 2485.38] Instructing
[2485.38 → 2485.76] Timothy
[2485.76 → 2486.14] In how
[2486.14 → 2486.50] To deal
[2486.50 → 2486.68] With
[2486.68 → 2486.84] These
[2486.84 → 2487.08] And he
[2487.08 → 2487.52] Begins
[2487.52 → 2487.96] With a
[2487.96 → 2488.22] Talk
[2488.22 → 2488.50] About
[2488.50 → 2489.54] The law
[2489.54 → 2489.96] So we'll
[2489.96 → 2490.40] Take off
[2490.40 → 2490.84] From there
[2490.84 → 2491.54] Verse
[2491.54 → 2492.00] Eight
[2492.00 → 2494.42] We know
[2494.42 → 2495.36] That the
[2495.36 → 2495.80] Law
[2495.80 → 2496.68] Is good
[2496.68 → 2497.76] If one
[2497.76 → 2498.26] Uses
[2498.26 → 2498.52] It
[2498.52 → 2499.36] Properly
[2499.36 → 2501.10] We also
[2501.10 → 2501.44] Know
[2501.44 → 2501.84] That the
[2501.84 → 2502.26] Law
[2502.26 → 2502.90] Is made
[2502.90 → 2503.56] Not for
[2503.56 → 2503.74] The
[2503.74 → 2504.36] Righteous
[2504.36 → 2505.00] But for
[2505.00 → 2505.68] Lawbreakers
[2505.68 → 2506.18] And rebels
[2506.18 → 2507.56] The ungodly
[2507.56 → 2508.20] And sinful
[2508.20 → 2509.40] The unholy
[2509.40 → 2510.30] And irreligious
[2510.30 → 2511.06] For those
[2511.06 → 2511.72] Who kill
[2511.72 → 2512.52] Or strike
[2512.52 → 2513.16] It could be
[2513.16 → 2514.14] Their fathers
[2514.14 → 2515.00] Or mothers
[2515.00 → 2516.40] For murderers
[2516.40 → 2517.26] For sexually
[2517.26 → 2517.94] Immoral
[2517.94 → 2519.72] And for those
[2519.72 → 2520.34] Practicing
[2520.34 → 2521.56] Homosexuality
[2521.56 → 2522.50] For slave
[2522.50 → 2522.98] Traders
[2522.98 → 2523.92] And liars
[2523.92 → 2524.98] And perjurers
[2524.98 → 2525.52] And for
[2525.52 → 2526.22] Whatever else
[2526.22 → 2526.80] Is contrary
[2526.80 → 2527.20] To the
[2527.20 → 2527.94] Sound doctrine
[2527.94 → 2529.02] That conforms
[2529.02 → 2529.92] To the
[2529.92 → 2530.52] Gospel
[2530.52 → 2531.62] Concerning
[2531.62 → 2532.24] The glory
[2532.24 → 2532.78] Of the
[2532.78 → 2533.26] Blessed
[2533.26 → 2533.92] God
[2533.92 → 2534.64] Which is
[2534.64 → 2535.40] Entrusted
[2535.40 → 2536.34] To me
[2536.34 → 2537.38] And then
[2537.38 → 2538.18] Paul gets
[2538.18 → 2538.96] Personal
[2538.96 → 2539.72] Beginning at
[2539.72 → 2540.38] Verse 12
[2540.38 → 2542.94] I thank
[2542.94 → 2543.64] Christ
[2543.64 → 2544.14] Jesus
[2544.14 → 2544.86] Our Lord
[2544.86 → 2545.64] Who has
[2545.64 → 2546.16] Given me
[2546.16 → 2546.72] Strength
[2546.72 → 2547.98] That he
[2547.98 → 2548.88] Considered me
[2548.88 → 2549.68] Trustworthy
[2549.68 → 2551.48] Appointing me
[2551.48 → 2552.12] To his
[2552.12 → 2552.68] Service
[2552.68 → 2555.18] Even though
[2555.18 → 2556.50] I was
[2556.50 → 2556.96] Once
[2556.96 → 2558.50] A blasphemer
[2558.50 → 2560.30] And a
[2560.30 → 2561.02] Persecutor
[2561.02 → 2562.48] And a
[2562.48 → 2563.00] Violent
[2563.00 → 2563.36] Man
[2563.36 → 2565.32] I
[2565.32 → 2565.62] Was
[2565.62 → 2566.14] Shown

[2736.44 → 2736.66] But
[2736.66 → 2737.58] Essentially
[2737.58 → 2737.94] It's
[2737.94 → 2738.40] Referred

[2748.96 → 2749.56] And
[2749.56 → 2749.66] He
[2749.66 → 2749.80] Said
[2749.80 → 2749.94] I

[2769.32 → 2769.52] There
[2769.52 → 2769.68] Is

[4091.82 → 4100.30] Every
[4100.30 → 4120.74] Great. So I hope some of you girls who saw those pictures, you saw yourself,
[4121.34 → 4128.36] and that was really fun to see those. So would you now join me in prayer for our community prayer?
[4128.36 → 4129.26] Let's pray together.
[4131.30 → 4138.56] Lord, you are kind. We thank you for Jana and Kim and the work of our Gems ministry.
[4139.30 → 4145.58] We ask that you would bless them as they serve the girls in our congregation and in our community
[4145.58 → 4155.08] in the name of Jesus. Lord, give them energy, creativity, discernment. And Lord, we ask that
[4155.08 → 4161.50] these girls would grow to know you and to love you and to follow you. And Lord, even though we cannot
[4161.50 → 4167.06] gather, we thank you for the care packages that were sent, and we just ask that that would be just
[4167.06 → 4173.56] such a blessing to the girls. We thank you for Gary Rosema and his ministry among the seafarers.
[4173.62 → 4180.66] Lord, we ask that you would bless him as he serves those who are far away from home and family for long
[4180.66 → 4187.38] stretches of time. We pray that you would open their hearts to hear the gospel, that they would know Christ
[4187.38 → 4197.58] as their saviour. And Lord, you are kind. And we thank you for doctors, nurses, and those who are serving the sick,
[4197.58 → 4203.02] especially during this pandemic. We ask that you would heal the people they are attending.
[4204.08 → 4211.40] Lord, we ask that you would spare them in your mercy. And we also pray for members of our church family
[4211.40 → 4218.36] who are called to suffer. We pray for Shirley and Grace, who have chronic health problems.
[4219.24 → 4227.14] We pray for BEV, who is facing a health concern and is experiencing pain. We especially ask that you
[4227.14 → 4234.88] would be with Joan, Tim, and Kathy as they suffer with cancer. Lord, for all of these brothers and
[4234.88 → 4241.04] sisters, we ask that you would be merciful to them, that they would know your presence and your comfort.
[4243.16 → 4249.24] Lord, you are kind. And we ask that none in our church family would be lonely in this time.
[4249.80 → 4256.42] We lift our shut-ins to you, many of whom cannot have visitors at this time. We pray for core,
[4257.14 → 4257.98] Carl,
[4257.98 → 4259.60] Carl, Hench,
[4260.42 → 4261.02] Jeanette,
[4261.96 → 4262.46] Bill,
[4262.96 → 4263.54] and Get.
[4264.14 → 4266.90] Lord, give them the peace of your presence.
[4267.68 → 4271.24] And Lord, help us to reach out to them in different ways.
[4272.44 → 4275.16] Lord, help us to support and encourage each other.
[4275.42 → 4279.84] And help us also to serve our neighbours who are in distress in the name of Jesus.
[4280.82 → 4284.22] Lord, hear our prayers and answer us in Jesus' name.
[4284.22 → 4286.22] We pray. Amen.
[4286.22 → 4286.30] Amen.
[4288.78 → 4295.40] So as we conclude our worship service, we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4295.70 → 4298.78] So we'll have our benediction, and then we'll close with a final song.
[4299.34 → 4306.40] So wherever you are, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the blessing of your Heavenly Father.
[4306.40 → 4309.26] From Psalm 20,
