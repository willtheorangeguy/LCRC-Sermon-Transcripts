[0.00 → 6.26] Nos thanks to You, Bel Se Knox.
[6.78 → 13.72] Today, the class has won 11 hour Albeit.
[13.84 → 19.54] We will make many decisions about why not to lie.
[20.46 → 26.00] Thanks to away today!
[26.00 → 28.00] Amen.
[56.00 → 58.00] Amen.
[86.00 → 88.00] Amen.
[116.00 → 118.00] Amen.
[146.00 → 148.00] Amen.
[176.00 → 178.00] Amen.
[206.00 → 208.00] Amen.
[236.00 → 238.00] Amen.
[266.00 → 268.00] Amen.
[268.00 → 270.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[272.00 → 274.00] Amen.
[276.00 → 277.00] Good morning.
[277.00 → 286.00] Today is July 12, 2020, and you're at the YouTube site of the Ladder Christian Research
[286.00 → 288.00] Network.
[288.00 → 291.00] Good morning.
[291.00 → 296.72] July 12, 2020, and you're at the YouTube site of the Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[296.86 → 297.80] Welcome this morning.
[298.14 → 303.14] We have an unusual situation outside, bright sunny day with almost no clouds in the sky.
[303.52 → 306.14] So enjoy the day after this service.
[307.14 → 314.00] If you're a visitor to this site, to the Ladder Christian Reformed Church, you may not know
[314.00 → 316.72] who the players are here, although all the regular members do.
[316.72 → 321.02] I'm John Smith, and I'll have some aspects of worship leadership this morning.
[321.46 → 323.32] With me are Harry and Tony.
[323.66 → 328.34] These gentlemen are not only brothers in Christ, they are also brothers.
[328.96 → 330.42] And we welcome them this morning.
[330.72 → 332.78] And at the piano, we have Matthew Ma.
[333.32 → 339.88] He is on loan from the St. Helen's Anglican Church in Surrey, and we appreciate St. Helen's Church
[339.88 → 345.26] in offering to readjust their recording schedule, so Matthew can be here with us this morning.
[345.26 → 353.96] Our pastor, Jason Truly, will open God's word later on, bring a message later on, and lead
[353.96 → 356.00] us in our community prayer later this morning.
[358.72 → 360.34] I wish you could see us here.
[361.46 → 363.00] No, I know you can see us.
[363.74 → 366.02] I wish you could see us here.
[366.02 → 372.16] But unfortunately, we'll be going for the rest of the summer with pre-recorded services, and
[372.16 → 377.86] I'm hoping that you are able to get a blessing this morning on being able to visit us from
[377.86 → 378.52] at home.
[378.96 → 384.26] Last week, Marion challenged you, and I'll ask you to see if you'll respond to that challenge.
[384.36 → 388.18] She challenged you to call someone during the course of the week.
[388.18 → 392.70] If there's someone who you visit at church, sits near you every Sunday, and you like to
[392.70 → 393.80] say good morning to them.
[393.88 → 398.54] If there's someone who you meet after church that you meet because you think that they need
[398.54 → 401.70] some help from you, or you're that person who needs the help.
[401.82 → 407.18] Or if there's just a group of friends that you like to talk to each morning, choose one
[407.18 → 408.08] or two of those people.
[408.50 → 413.40] And I continue that challenge that Marion put before you and say, call them up during the
[413.40 → 414.00] course of the week.
[414.00 → 418.18] We are a Christian community, and it's more difficult this time to function as a community.
[418.84 → 420.18] Let's try it that way.
[422.16 → 426.10] Speaking of things not being normal, we normally have an offering time during the course of
[426.10 → 430.60] the service, and there is no way for us to collect that offering this morning.
[430.70 → 434.38] So you have to provide that offering in other ways.
[434.76 → 439.68] And our accountant reminds us that you've been faithful in doing so, and we thank you for
[439.68 → 439.90] that.
[439.90 → 446.38] You can continue to mail a check, drop off a check at the church, make an online contribution
[446.38 → 447.22] at our website.
[447.90 → 452.62] All the details for various options are in our Connections newsletter, and you can look
[452.62 → 454.32] at that for details.
[455.54 → 458.60] Today, the offering is for Raise Up Global Ministries.
[458.60 → 462.72] This is an organization of the Christian Reformed Church in North America.
[463.48 → 467.70] It's committed to educating Christian leaders in communities around the world.
[468.06 → 472.44] This includes actually providing materials to our own Coffee Break Ministries program.
[472.98 → 475.90] But they also have the Timothy Leadership Training Program.
[476.36 → 481.44] For over 20 years, they have provided essential training to church leaders worldwide, in many
[481.44 → 483.90] countries, and in over 30 languages.
[483.90 → 489.84] That's our offering donation focus this morning.
[491.12 → 497.08] To begin this church service, I'd like to begin with an opening prayer, asking God to join
[497.08 → 498.14] with us this morning.
[498.38 → 499.24] Would you pray with me?
[502.18 → 508.92] Almighty God, you ask us to stop what we are doing once in a week and focus our thoughts on
[508.92 → 509.14] you.
[509.74 → 510.54] And so we do.
[511.82 → 513.02] Please join with us.
[513.02 → 517.70] We pray for your blessing on your church meeting in this place.
[518.64 → 522.04] Here may the faithful find salvation and the careless be awakened.
[522.80 → 526.38] Here may the doubting find faith and the anxious be encouraged.
[527.30 → 530.96] Here may the tempted find help and the sorrowful find comfort.
[531.72 → 535.78] Here may the aged find consolation and the young be inspired.
[536.52 → 539.54] We pray this through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[540.06 → 540.54] Amen.
[540.54 → 540.62] Amen.
[540.62 → 548.98] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 47, verses 1 and 2.
[550.58 → 555.50] I invite you to read along with me at the portions that are bolded.
[555.50 → 560.58] Clap your hands, all you peoples.
[561.12 → 564.94] Shout to the Lord with loud songs of joy.
[566.06 → 571.12] For the Lord, the Most High, is awesome, a great king over all the earth.
[571.12 → 576.14] God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
[576.14 → 578.80] Sing praises to God.
[578.80 → 579.74] Sing praises.
[579.90 → 581.34] Sing praises to our king.
[581.84 → 582.60] Sing praises.
[582.60 → 589.22] The Lord's greeting comes to you from Jude, verses 1 and 2.
[589.22 → 596.48] To those who are called, who are beloved by God the Father, and kept safe for Jesus Christ,
[597.04 → 601.50] may mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[601.50 → 605.40] Let's sing several songs of praise.
[605.40 → 607.22] We encourage you to sing from home.
[607.86 → 613.92] We will do our best to provide lots of melodies so that you can easily sing along with us.
[614.18 → 617.56] We'll begin by singing praise to the Lord the Almighty.
[617.56 → 637.16] Praise to the Lord the Almighty, the King of creation.
[638.52 → 645.82] O my soul, praise Him for He is your health and salvation.
[645.82 → 654.20] Come all who hear, brothers and sisters, draw near.
[654.60 → 659.36] Join me in glad adoration.
[662.00 → 670.12] Praise to the Lord who will prosper your work and defend you.
[670.12 → 678.72] Surely His goodness and mercy shall daily attend you.
[679.28 → 686.12] Ponder anew what the Almighty can do.
[686.56 → 692.12] As with His love He befriends you.
[692.12 → 702.60] Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him.
[702.60 → 711.38] All that has life and breath, come now with praises before Him.
[711.38 → 718.66] Let the Almighty come from His people again.
[718.66 → 725.36] Let me forever adore Him.
[741.38 → 753.12] Beautiful Saviour, King of creation,
[753.12 → 763.04] Son of God and Son of Man.
[763.04 → 768.20] Truly I love Thee.
[768.20 → 773.04] Truly I serve Thee.
[773.04 → 782.48] Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
[783.82 → 787.82] Fair is the sunshine.
[787.82 → 792.82] Fair is the moonlight.
[792.82 → 801.94] Bright the sparkling stars on high.
[801.94 → 806.26] Jesus shines brighter.
[806.26 → 810.82] Jesus shines purer.
[810.82 → 820.82] Than all the angels in the sky.
[820.82 → 831.14] Beautiful Saviour, Lord of the nations.
[831.14 → 839.82] Son of God and Son of Man.
[839.82 → 842.82] The order of Lord of the nations.
[842.82 → 849.76] The children of the nations.
[849.82 → 861.32] He is their's throne of their nations.
[861.82 → 865.82] Amen.
[865.82 → 866.38] Amen.
[866.38 → 889.24] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[889.24 → 892.96] Open the eyes of my heart.
[892.96 → 896.16] I want to see you.
[897.54 → 900.68] I want to see you.
[902.90 → 907.26] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[907.80 → 910.82] Open the eyes of my heart.
[910.82 → 914.04] I want to see you.
[915.32 → 919.22] I want to see you.
[919.22 → 924.50] I want to see you high and lifted.
[925.32 → 928.78] Shining in the light of your glory.
[930.28 → 932.42] A lounge of power and love.
[933.30 → 937.18] As we sing holy, holy, holy.
[937.18 → 941.70] Holy, holy, holy.
[942.70 → 946.04] Holy, holy, holy.
[947.24 → 950.40] Holy, holy, holy.
[950.40 → 954.38] I want to see you.
[954.38 → 959.26] Holy, holy, holy.
[960.68 → 963.66] Holy, holy, holy.
[964.84 → 967.92] Holy, holy, holy.
[967.92 → 971.54] I want to see you.
[971.54 → 985.02] For our time of confession, I've chosen a text based on Matthew 22.
[986.10 → 987.80] It's a responsive reading again.
[988.40 → 990.46] Join with me on the bold text.
[990.46 → 997.02] Jesus calls us to love God with all our hearts.
[998.54 → 999.68] All our hearts?
[1001.02 → 1007.68] More than our family and friends, our homes, our jobs, our cars, our computers?
[1007.68 → 1025.10] More than all these, because when we love God with all our heart, it is that love which influences us and enables us to act lovingly towards not only family and friends who may be easy to love, but towards others who may not be so easy to love.
[1026.32 → 1030.24] And we realize that people matter more than things.
[1030.58 → 1035.12] Forgive us, O God, when we fail to put you first in our lives.
[1035.12 → 1040.28] Jesus calls us to love God with all our soul.
[1041.60 → 1042.76] Our whole being?
[1043.40 → 1046.30] More than anyone or anything we invest energy in?
[1046.60 → 1051.66] Music, sport, art, gardening, any of our hobbies?
[1053.10 → 1054.72] More than all of these.
[1055.20 → 1063.90] Because when we love God with all our soul, it is God's dynamic love which directs how we use our energy, our interests, our power.
[1063.90 → 1070.08] However, who we are and what we do can then be used to benefit others as well as ourselves.
[1071.60 → 1076.36] Forgive us, O God, when we fail to put you first in our lives.
[1076.36 → 1080.36] Jesus calls us to love God with all our mind.
[1081.74 → 1083.10] Surely not all of our mind.
[1084.10 → 1091.24] More than our thirst for knowledge, our learning in schools, and beyond the books we read, our advances in information technology?
[1091.24 → 1094.14] More than all these.
[1094.14 → 1101.22] Because when we love God with all our mind, it is God's creative love which then inspires our thoughts and our will,
[1101.74 → 1109.98] so that our wisdom and knowledge are shaped by God's kingdom values of justice, mercy, love, and peace.
[1111.28 → 1115.22] Forgive us, O God, when we fail to put you first in our lives.
[1115.22 → 1120.00] But God has an assurance of forgiveness.
[1120.86 → 1121.80] Hear the good news.
[1122.58 → 1128.96] God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.
[1129.38 → 1131.46] Those who believe in him are not condemned.
[1132.28 → 1134.62] In Jesus Christ, therefore, we are forgiven.
[1135.70 → 1137.02] Thanks be to God.
[1137.02 → 1141.92] Our song of response is, Lift High the Cross.
[1141.92 → 1141.96] Lift high the cross.
[1154.36 → 1158.22] Lift high the cross.
[1158.22 → 1158.24] Lift high the cross.
[1158.60 → 1162.60] The love of Christ proclaims.
[1162.60 → 1170.96] Till all the world adore his sacred name.
[1170.96 → 1175.16] Come, Christians, follow.
[1176.20 → 1183.60] We are seated, God, the Lamb victorious.
[1184.56 → 1188.52] Christ, the Son of God.
[1188.52 → 1189.52] Lift high the cross.
[1189.52 → 1192.46] Lift high the cross.
[1192.46 → 1196.88] The love of Christ proclaims.
[1196.88 → 1205.12] Till all the world adore his sacred name.
[1205.12 → 1208.90] From north and south.
[1208.90 → 1213.06] From east and west we raise.
[1213.06 → 1214.06] In Romanesque.
[1214.06 → 1218.06] In Romanesque.
[1218.06 → 1220.06] The song of grace.
[1220.06 → 1222.06] The song of grace.
[1222.06 → 1226.20] Live high the cross.
[1226.20 → 1230.06] The life of Christ proclaims.
[1230.06 → 1238.06] Which will the Lord adore his sacred name.
[1238.06 → 1248.06] Let every race and every language tell of him.
[1248.06 → 1255.06] Who saves our lives from death and hell.
[1255.06 → 1256.48] Why covenant вроде and PAUL.
[1256.48 → 1257.06] May Jesus be safe?
[1257.06 → 1257.60] All in church.
[1257.60 → 1258.06] Yes, Christ...
[1258.06 → 1262.86] God, the Lord adore his sacred name.
[1262.86 → 1270.16] The lord of Christ proclaims.
[1270.16 → 1272.90] While my им direct matter that word is sacred name.
[1272.90 → 1288.64] So shall our song of triumph ever be, praise to the crucified for victory.
[1288.64 → 1306.66] Live by the cross, the love of Christ proclaiming, and all the love of Christ they say to be.
[1312.66 → 1314.58] Good morning, friends.
[1314.58 → 1321.02] We are in a sermon series called The Church in Movement.
[1322.06 → 1327.26] And we're considering together the purpose of the church.
[1327.86 → 1338.42] But especially the mission that Jesus has given us to invite our neighbours into the life that we have in Christ.
[1339.56 → 1343.30] And we're going to the book of Acts to teach us.
[1343.30 → 1347.52] And we're asking the Holy Spirit to guide us.
[1347.98 → 1351.38] And we're listening for the Spirit's voice.
[1352.80 → 1357.50] And so, so far in Acts, you know, Jesus has just ascended into heaven.
[1358.10 → 1363.10] And we have this group of 120 followers of Jesus.
[1363.10 → 1369.68] They have been waiting and praying for the promise of Jesus who would send the Holy Spirit.
[1369.68 → 1375.54] And then the Spirit came upon them on the day of Pentecost.
[1376.10 → 1378.66] The Spirit fills the followers with Jesus.
[1379.46 → 1385.56] And now all of Jesus' followers, even us today, become the temple of God.
[1385.56 → 1392.56] Where God actually dwells in us, personally, and among us as a community, the church.
[1392.56 → 1400.78] And God's Spirit being poured out on these disciples led then to this incredible sermon by Peter.
[1401.18 → 1405.52] Where he expresses that all that is happening is the fulfillment of Scripture.
[1406.24 → 1410.80] And it's all wrapped up in this person of Jesus.
[1411.24 → 1417.50] Who died upon the cross, who rose again from the dead, and who ascended to the right hand of the Father.
[1417.50 → 1430.66] And then Peter says, what you are experiencing today is His Spirit working in us and through us, drawing you into the kingdom of God.
[1432.06 → 1436.36] And it says, when the people heard this, they asked Peter what shall we do?
[1437.08 → 1442.44] And Peter says, repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins and receive the Holy Spirit.
[1443.18 → 1446.04] And it says they were cut to the heart.
[1446.04 → 1450.04] Right? These people came into contact with the living Christ.
[1450.54 → 1459.38] And their salvation was so radical and so transformative that it changed the trajectory of their entire lives.
[1460.52 → 1465.12] And then it says, 3,000 people were added to the church that day.
[1465.80 → 1468.80] That's an amazing harvest.
[1469.22 → 1470.86] And it's the Holy Spirit that's working.
[1470.96 → 1474.92] It wasn't Peter's sermon, but it was the truth of who Jesus was.
[1474.92 → 1483.98] And so what we're going to see now today is that immediately what happens is the church is formed.
[1485.00 → 1491.74] So why don't you open your Bibles to Acts chapter 2, and we'll be reading verses 42 to 47.
[1491.90 → 1493.14] We'll have it up on the screen.
[1494.52 → 1497.60] But if you have your Bibles and can keep it open, that's great too.
[1497.60 → 1504.56] And this is kind of the classic text describing the community of the early church.
[1505.44 → 1509.12] And if you've grown up in the church, you're probably very familiar with it.
[1510.18 → 1514.80] And yet even every time I read it, I find it very moving.
[1515.88 → 1522.24] There's something in my heart that recognizes that this is the kind of community that we were meant for.
[1522.24 → 1525.64] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[1526.64 → 1533.90] They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[1534.92 → 1539.70] Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
[1540.70 → 1544.98] All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[1544.98 → 1549.06] They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[1550.26 → 1553.86] Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[1554.42 → 1558.22] They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.
[1559.28 → 1563.28] Praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people.
[1564.00 → 1567.92] And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[1568.98 → 1570.80] Friends, this is the word of the Lord.
[1571.76 → 1572.94] Thanks be to God.
[1572.94 → 1574.32] So let's pray together.
[1574.98 → 1586.22] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this beautiful picture of what the Holy Spirit builds when it comes upon a people.
[1587.06 → 1590.92] And Lord, we thank you for this picture of the church.
[1592.24 → 1601.82] Lord, we ask that even as we read your word, that by your spirit you would illumine our hearts to teach us what it would look like.
[1601.82 → 1604.64] Lord, to be the community of Christ followers.
[1604.98 → 1606.34] And Lord, we need your help.
[1606.82 → 1609.46] So we pray that you would teach us in Jesus' name.
[1609.90 → 1610.20] Amen.
[1612.44 → 1616.30] And so the kids are on summer break, and we have some extra time together.
[1616.30 → 1620.62] And one of the things we've been enjoying doing lately is playing chess.
[1621.66 → 1626.94] And so last week I lost to my daughter Ellie.
[1626.94 → 1628.18] It was devastating.
[1628.18 → 1629.30] It was devastating.
[1630.08 → 1631.36] Actually, I was really proud of her.
[1632.58 → 1633.62] And she's actually quite good.
[1633.68 → 1634.32] I'm not that good.
[1634.58 → 1635.22] So it's fine.
[1635.98 → 1641.88] But one thing I've heard about chess is that if you want to learn how to play chess really well,
[1642.18 → 1646.18] one of the best things you can do is to take your queen off the board.
[1646.18 → 1651.12] And because, you know, the queen is the most powerful piece on the board,
[1651.12 → 1658.78] and because it's so powerful, it's easy to rely on it and become dependent on it,
[1659.58 → 1665.86] then we never really learn or discover what all the other pieces can do.
[1665.86 → 1674.00] So when it comes to living out the Christian faith and when it comes to our ministries together,
[1674.90 → 1678.80] our Sunday gathering is the queen on the board, isn't it?
[1679.90 → 1683.22] In many senses, it's the most powerful piece,
[1683.82 → 1687.84] so much so that we can't imagine doing anything without it.
[1688.82 → 1690.38] How do we worship?
[1691.10 → 1692.84] How do we form community?
[1692.84 → 1696.72] How do we do outreach and make disciples?
[1698.00 → 1705.86] Everything we do, we imagine through the lens of our Sunday worship, our gathering,
[1706.46 → 1709.28] through this lens of the queen on the board.
[1710.32 → 1715.26] But for the last few months during this pandemic, the queen has been off the board.
[1716.40 → 1721.70] And this gives us an opportunity to ask, well, what is the church?
[1721.70 → 1727.80] Is church basically a Sunday morning gathering once a week?
[1727.96 → 1728.58] Is that it?
[1729.92 → 1732.74] And what we see in this passage is that the answer is no.
[1733.64 → 1739.32] The church is the community that belongs to and is gathered around Jesus Christ through the Spirit.
[1741.08 → 1745.10] And so it's so much more, so much more going on,
[1745.16 → 1750.04] it's so much more that we are than just a once a week social gathering.
[1750.04 → 1757.92] And so I think living for a time without the queen can give us insight into who we are supposed to be
[1757.92 → 1760.48] and what is the church in all of its fullness.
[1761.68 → 1764.12] And so as we come to this passage, our question is,
[1764.30 → 1767.40] what kind of church did the Holy Spirit create?
[1768.38 → 1770.18] And we'll see three things.
[1770.36 → 1771.82] And the first one is this,
[1772.36 → 1775.56] that they were a people devoted to learning.
[1775.56 → 1778.48] They were devoted to the apostles' teaching, it says.
[1779.50 → 1785.92] The apostles' teaching, this refers to the teaching of what the apostles had learned from Jesus.
[1786.62 → 1790.90] After Jesus rose, he stayed, and he taught them for 40 days.
[1791.10 → 1794.16] They had spent three years with Jesus day to day.
[1794.50 → 1798.02] They had absorbed all of his teachings, his life.
[1798.02 → 1803.98] And so as this community was gathered, they devoted themselves to learning from the apostles.
[1804.92 → 1805.12] Right?
[1805.18 → 1807.38] This community had the Old Testament scriptures.
[1808.22 → 1815.72] And now they were looking at Jesus as the fulfillment of all that the Old Testament was pointing to.
[1816.52 → 1820.04] They wanted to learn about what God had done in Jesus
[1820.04 → 1825.68] and how this fits together with what they already knew from the Jewish scriptures.
[1825.68 → 1834.94] And so the apostles basically taught these 3,000 new believers about who Jesus is,
[1835.22 → 1839.42] about what Jesus calls them to, about what does it mean to be born again?
[1840.30 → 1844.42] What does it mean to receive this new life that God has given them?
[1845.12 → 1852.32] They wanted to understand this new reality that has come to them in which they now stand.
[1852.32 → 1859.32] And they wanted to hear so that their lives would conform to the teaching.
[1859.96 → 1865.50] It wasn't the kind of teaching that or learning that we sometimes do, which is kind of proud learning.
[1866.00 → 1871.02] But they actually wanted their lives to conform to what they were hearing.
[1872.62 → 1879.02] You know, and this is very frequently a sign of someone newly awakened in the spirit
[1879.02 → 1881.70] and experiencing the life of Jesus afresh.
[1882.40 → 1884.00] They longed to hear from the Bible.
[1884.12 → 1886.36] Maybe you can remember when you first became a Christian.
[1886.62 → 1889.60] Or maybe there were times in your life of spiritual growth
[1889.60 → 1892.90] where you longed for the Bible.
[1893.02 → 1895.02] You longed for the teaching of scripture.
[1896.16 → 1900.42] Like a newborn infant longs for its mother's milk, we're told.
[1900.42 → 1906.88] So they were growing Christians, which is an exhausting process.
[1907.60 → 1907.72] Right?
[1907.78 → 1910.34] They need lots of food to metabolize.
[1911.40 → 1918.02] You should see how much food we consume at my house with four growing kids.
[1918.68 → 1922.58] They're energetic, and they eat a lot.
[1923.30 → 1925.40] And the two go together.
[1927.16 → 1929.50] So how are we living this out?
[1930.42 → 1933.16] You know, we are a community that's learning from the Bible.
[1933.96 → 1940.74] And we're eagerly wanting to make that learning practical in our lives today.
[1941.78 → 1947.78] But sometimes a Christian can lose that initial devotion to hear the Bible.
[1948.54 → 1954.58] I know that I have sometimes in my life been hungry for the Bible.
[1955.26 → 1957.96] And other times, not at all.
[1957.96 → 1963.98] And this devotion to the apostles' teaching we see here should convict us deeply.
[1964.68 → 1968.76] Because maybe we recognize that our lives are devoted to a lot of things
[1968.76 → 1970.68] that have nothing to do with Christ.
[1971.32 → 1977.68] And our devotion to Christ, tragically, we notice, becomes a last priority.
[1979.08 → 1982.94] You know, the written word of God, the Bible, is inspired by God.
[1982.94 → 1986.24] It's his revelation to us about himself.
[1987.00 → 1996.66] And he's given us a revelation about our need for him and his intention for what life should look like in communion with him.
[1997.34 → 2002.58] And we need to understand the scriptures if we're going to understand the heart of our God.
[2002.58 → 2007.14] And so God gives us our part.
[2007.80 → 2008.88] What's our part?
[2009.00 → 2012.62] Our part is to listen to the word and be in the word.
[2013.34 → 2018.16] And it's his part to speak to us through the word.
[2018.86 → 2020.04] So now here's the thing.
[2021.14 → 2025.94] Jesus said that when the Holy Spirit comes, that he is the spirit of truth.
[2025.94 → 2031.66] And he will bring to remembrance all that Jesus taught and said.
[2033.10 → 2038.08] But the spirit cannot bring to remembrance something that you have not first placed in your head.
[2038.70 → 2039.04] Right?
[2039.14 → 2040.04] I'll say that again.
[2040.88 → 2047.04] The Holy Spirit cannot bring to remembrance something that you have not first placed in your head.
[2047.68 → 2048.14] Right?
[2048.34 → 2050.32] The spirit can be an incredible teacher,
[2050.32 → 2055.92] but it doesn't help if you and I are horrible students.
[2057.20 → 2058.72] So in other words,
[2059.36 → 2063.78] you have to spend time in the Bible if the spirit's going to help you understand it.
[2064.40 → 2064.74] Right?
[2064.76 → 2067.50] You have to actually take in the information.
[2067.70 → 2070.52] You need to absorb it and be immersed in it.
[2071.24 → 2071.38] Right?
[2071.48 → 2074.56] The spirit cannot illuminate something that isn't there.
[2074.56 → 2079.90] And so at the start of the service, we pray for the spirit's illumination
[2079.90 → 2085.02] because we're reading his word, and we need the spirit's help to understand it.
[2085.12 → 2086.62] But the two go hand in hand.
[2086.96 → 2091.82] We can't stand here, pray for the spirit's illumination, and then never open the Bible.
[2094.28 → 2096.54] You know, Bishop N.T. Wright says it well.
[2096.54 → 2098.60] He says,
[2099.88 → 2121.02] You know, friends, ourselves, you and me, our children, our grandchildren,
[2121.94 → 2125.18] will be swallowed up by this culture.
[2125.18 → 2131.14] They will be sucked away down this funnel towards not having faith
[2131.14 → 2137.34] unless we are devoted to bringing them to the feet of the apostles' teaching.
[2138.70 → 2144.46] You know, there are many reasons why our devotion can cool toward the Bible.
[2145.50 → 2150.32] You know, lots of reasons why our enjoyment and our enthusiasm for reading the Bible
[2150.32 → 2152.84] kind of rolls like a wave up and down.
[2152.84 → 2157.84] But this should not surprise us, actually, because think about it.
[2158.38 → 2161.26] This dynamic is true for all the loves of my heart.
[2162.70 → 2166.02] So I want to encourage you to keep encountering the Bible
[2166.02 → 2170.08] even when it doesn't seem attractive to you.
[2170.88 → 2174.76] My experience is that when I make myself encounter the teaching,
[2174.76 → 2178.48] when I spend time in God's word,
[2178.56 → 2181.38] even if I'm not drawn to it necessarily,
[2181.66 → 2184.50] what happens is my devotion is rekindled.
[2185.44 → 2188.80] And this is also true of other loves of my life.
[2190.14 → 2192.72] And so at Pentecost, a community was born
[2192.72 → 2195.42] that was devoted to the apostles' teaching.
[2195.42 → 2203.42] Secondly, the young church was also devoted to loving one another.
[2203.52 → 2204.90] They were devoted to the fellowship.
[2206.52 → 2208.94] Now I wonder, what comes to your mind
[2208.94 → 2211.62] when you hear the word fellowship?
[2212.40 → 2213.94] It's kind of a loaded term
[2213.94 → 2217.34] if you've been involved in Christian community for a long time.
[2217.34 → 2220.44] Well, you know, maybe what comes to your mind
[2220.44 → 2224.26] is a bad potluck and talking about sports.
[2224.70 → 2226.48] I don't think that's probably ever happened here.
[2226.56 → 2229.32] I think all the food I've ever eaten here has been good.
[2229.94 → 2232.48] But it's not always the case, right, in some places.
[2233.98 → 2238.40] But the word here in the text is Livonia.
[2238.82 → 2242.12] And it has at its root the word common.
[2242.12 → 2245.76] Like Livonia Greek was the common Greek language
[2245.76 → 2247.58] of the entire Mediterranean.
[2247.78 → 2249.26] And that's the Greek we have of the Bible.
[2249.60 → 2249.98] Common.
[2251.08 → 2253.18] And so this fellowship, what it means,
[2254.20 → 2257.54] essentially, is that they had everything in common.
[2258.90 → 2260.86] There's a lot here that describes
[2260.86 → 2262.64] the fellowship of the early church
[2262.64 → 2264.44] in verses 42 to 47.
[2264.80 → 2266.80] But let me just point out a few things quickly.
[2267.66 → 2270.24] First, we see a commitment to being together.
[2270.24 → 2273.16] Look at verse 44.
[2273.36 → 2276.78] It says, all who believed were together.
[2277.52 → 2277.74] Right?
[2277.78 → 2280.24] There's this commitment to being gathered together locally.
[2280.52 → 2283.70] So what they shared in common was just being together.
[2284.88 → 2288.70] Secondly, we also see a radical generosity
[2288.70 → 2292.18] and hospitality that is being practiced in the community.
[2292.44 → 2296.00] Verse 45 tells us that people voluntarily,
[2296.34 → 2299.08] not by coercion, but voluntarily and willingly
[2299.08 → 2302.46] sold their possessions, their property, their real estate,
[2302.46 → 2305.66] in order to give to those who had need.
[2306.20 → 2306.30] Right?
[2306.36 → 2310.10] There was a deep concern for the most vulnerable,
[2310.38 → 2312.90] the weakest, and the poorest in the community.
[2313.94 → 2318.72] And then verse 46 talks about breaking bread in their homes
[2318.72 → 2322.10] and this emphasis on sharing meals together.
[2322.10 → 2325.70] And, you know, we get the sense that it wasn't just about eating
[2325.70 → 2328.66] that they were so excited about, although that's important.
[2329.16 → 2332.60] But we really get the sense that they were sharing life together.
[2333.60 → 2337.22] As they had these meals, they were these sacred moments
[2337.22 → 2341.78] whereas they broke bread that they shared life together.
[2341.78 → 2348.26] And third, they were together around the person of Jesus.
[2349.14 → 2349.36] Right?
[2349.40 → 2353.14] They had this commonality that was far more important
[2353.14 → 2354.42] than all of their differences.
[2355.14 → 2355.98] And think about it.
[2356.00 → 2358.76] They were a bunch of, they were a motley crew.
[2358.86 → 2360.82] They were a bunch of really different kinds of people.
[2361.36 → 2364.26] They had come from all different classes of society.
[2364.68 → 2367.28] You had free and slave.
[2367.72 → 2369.20] You had Greek and Jew.
[2369.20 → 2373.50] You had men and women, and yet they were together as family.
[2374.02 → 2376.12] And friends, this was revolutionary.
[2376.38 → 2379.50] This was completely counter to the culture of the Roman Empire,
[2379.76 → 2383.42] where there were all kinds of social organizations and associations,
[2383.98 → 2389.14] but they were either only freed people, or they were just men.
[2389.26 → 2391.74] Women were allowed, or they had women without men,
[2391.88 → 2394.30] or only certain ethnic classes,
[2394.40 → 2396.98] and you had to pay in dues to be part of these associations.
[2396.98 → 2400.76] The church was radically new.
[2401.20 → 2404.18] There was this group of people from all walks of life,
[2404.30 → 2406.10] all races, genders.
[2406.28 → 2409.48] It was something that the world had never seen before.
[2411.14 → 2413.44] And so here you have this fellowship that occurred
[2413.44 → 2415.50] where truly Jesus was the head.
[2416.38 → 2420.06] That was their commonality, and they were the body of Christ.
[2420.06 → 2425.92] So when sociologists describe communities like this,
[2426.52 → 2428.02] they've come up with this term,
[2428.76 → 2430.72] and it's called a thick community.
[2431.76 → 2432.72] A thick community.
[2433.96 → 2436.60] And part of the reason is that they're recognizing that
[2436.60 → 2438.28] in our modern Western world,
[2438.66 → 2440.08] you know, like the one that we live in,
[2441.14 → 2442.86] they're filled with connection,
[2442.86 → 2447.20] but they are often lacking in belonging.
[2448.38 → 2450.64] I know there's, in our lives,
[2450.68 → 2452.74] we have plenty of relationships and connections
[2452.74 → 2455.76] and networks that can happen.
[2456.68 → 2459.68] And you can even feel overwhelmed
[2459.68 → 2461.52] by the number of people that you know,
[2461.88 → 2464.60] and by all the contacts that you have.
[2464.60 → 2471.12] And yet, part of the strangeness of modern existence
[2471.12 → 2473.86] is that in the midst of all that connection,
[2474.58 → 2475.86] there's still something missing.
[2476.60 → 2481.02] There's still this lack of thick, deep belonging.
[2482.54 → 2483.66] And so these sociologists,
[2483.78 → 2486.18] they talk about thick community in contrast
[2486.18 → 2488.14] to these thin connections
[2488.14 → 2490.36] that we develop in our modern world.
[2491.14 → 2493.20] And so David Brooks has written about this,
[2493.20 → 2495.44] and he has a new book called The Second Story Mountain,
[2495.74 → 2496.96] where he describes this.
[2498.28 → 2499.96] So here are some quotes from him.
[2500.02 → 2500.44] He says,
[2500.94 → 2506.10] A thick community seeks to change the person's very identity.
[2507.16 → 2509.10] It engages the whole person,
[2509.54 → 2511.70] head, hands, heart, and soul.
[2512.72 → 2515.16] People tend to like the version of themselves
[2515.16 → 2516.58] that is called forth
[2516.58 → 2519.48] when they are in these thick communities.
[2520.84 → 2521.80] He goes on,
[2521.80 → 2524.44] Thick communities have a physical location,
[2524.90 → 2525.76] often cramped,
[2526.34 → 2529.12] where members meet face-to-face on a regular basis,
[2529.48 → 2530.52] such as a dinner table.
[2531.68 → 2535.12] Such communities have a set of collective rituals.
[2535.96 → 2537.58] They often tell and retell
[2537.58 → 2539.80] a sacred origin story about themselves.
[2541.00 → 2543.92] Thick communities are oriented around a shared cause.
[2544.58 → 2547.26] They don't see their members as resources to be exploited,
[2547.26 → 2550.90] but as fellow marchers in a holy mission.
[2552.66 → 2554.44] Friends, do you hear what he's describing?
[2555.24 → 2556.82] He's describing the church.
[2557.88 → 2560.68] And what we're noticing is that our world today,
[2561.40 → 2562.28] in our world today,
[2562.36 → 2563.98] is that what we long for
[2563.98 → 2565.70] and what we thirst for
[2565.70 → 2567.80] are these thick communities of belonging.
[2567.80 → 2571.60] And this is exactly what the early church was.
[2572.30 → 2572.50] Right?
[2572.58 → 2573.54] It saw itself,
[2573.76 → 2575.12] not primarily as
[2575.12 → 2577.60] gathering hundreds of people,
[2577.72 → 2579.80] thousands of people in thin connections,
[2580.26 → 2582.70] but rather it saw itself as a network
[2582.70 → 2584.26] of house-to-house communities
[2584.26 → 2587.82] that were developing this deep, rich thickness.
[2587.82 → 2591.96] And can you sense how attractive
[2591.96 → 2595.04] and how beautiful that was back then and today?
[2595.72 → 2599.88] This kind of life together is contagious.
[2600.96 → 2604.76] It is itself a form of proclaiming Jesus
[2604.76 → 2606.30] as the light of the world.
[2607.44 → 2610.14] You know, Jesus himself said that evangelism begins
[2610.14 → 2612.48] with how the community loves one another.
[2613.12 → 2613.68] He said,
[2613.68 → 2616.40] they will know you are my disciples
[2616.40 → 2618.74] by your love for one another.
[2620.22 → 2622.76] So I think we need to understand
[2622.76 → 2626.12] that the gospel is most powerfully proclaimed
[2626.12 → 2629.74] when we are committed to life together.
[2630.36 → 2634.66] In fact, the early church never had any statements
[2634.66 → 2636.90] or teaching about evangelism or mission.
[2637.42 → 2639.70] But the church grew exponentially
[2639.70 → 2642.84] just because of the quality
[2642.84 → 2645.06] of their life together.
[2645.42 → 2646.48] And it was attractive.
[2649.54 → 2651.06] And that leads us to
[2651.06 → 2652.56] our final point this morning.
[2653.32 → 2656.42] So the church was devoted to learning,
[2657.14 → 2659.00] following the apostles' teaching.
[2659.12 → 2660.76] They were devoted to loving one another
[2660.76 → 2662.74] in rich community, in thick community.
[2663.70 → 2665.82] And lastly, we see this devotion
[2665.82 → 2668.10] to leading the people
[2668.10 → 2671.16] that were around them to Christ.
[2671.16 → 2673.66] So we see this in verse 47.
[2673.86 → 2674.38] It says,
[2675.04 → 2676.60] they were praising God
[2676.60 → 2678.80] and enjoying the favour of all the people.
[2679.78 → 2682.32] And the Lord added to their number daily
[2682.32 → 2684.36] those who were being saved.
[2685.18 → 2687.76] So who added to their number daily?
[2688.34 → 2689.40] The Lord.
[2689.92 → 2690.06] Right?
[2690.16 → 2692.54] God was adding to their number daily.
[2692.70 → 2694.12] People were being saved.
[2694.12 → 2698.36] And when we hear that word saved,
[2699.08 → 2701.68] that's an odd word in our day, isn't it?
[2702.66 → 2705.30] What were people being saved from?
[2706.42 → 2708.86] Well, they were being saved from
[2708.86 → 2712.16] this kingdom of self.
[2713.16 → 2716.16] They were being saved from fear of death.
[2716.16 → 2718.22] And they were being saved
[2718.22 → 2720.42] from the righteous judgment of God
[2720.42 → 2721.78] because of their sin.
[2723.02 → 2725.76] And so friends, we are saved from bad things.
[2726.52 → 2729.58] But it's also important to remember,
[2730.12 → 2731.72] especially in our day,
[2731.82 → 2734.62] that we are also saved into good things.
[2735.40 → 2736.90] So look at this community
[2736.90 → 2738.84] that is being described here.
[2738.94 → 2740.86] That is what they were saved into.
[2740.86 → 2746.00] So generosity replaces selfishness.
[2746.96 → 2752.08] Joy and hope and gladness replaces fear.
[2752.92 → 2756.30] Goodness and wisdom replaces evil and foolishness.
[2756.92 → 2758.42] Rather than being God's enemies,
[2758.80 → 2760.76] we become God's beloved children.
[2761.70 → 2764.40] And when the church is a contagious community,
[2765.14 → 2767.68] it is obvious to our neighbours
[2767.68 → 2770.12] what people are being saved into.
[2770.86 → 2772.34] And this makes the message
[2772.34 → 2775.06] that we are being saved from things
[2775.06 → 2777.32] more understandable today.
[2778.90 → 2780.88] A loving and generous community
[2780.88 → 2782.24] birthed by the Spirit
[2782.24 → 2785.44] makes the testimony of the gospel tangible.
[2786.26 → 2786.40] Right?
[2786.46 → 2790.36] And so our ideas, our theology,
[2790.70 → 2792.12] you know, it ought to be taught.
[2792.78 → 2794.22] But more than that,
[2794.38 → 2795.38] more than taught,
[2795.50 → 2796.62] it ought to be seen.
[2796.62 → 2800.64] It ought to be experienced.
[2801.14 → 2802.50] And even more than that,
[2802.88 → 2805.12] it ought to be smelled.
[2805.70 → 2806.88] As strange as that is,
[2806.90 → 2807.96] that's the way the Bible speaks,
[2808.24 → 2811.18] the aroma of Christ among us.
[2812.90 → 2813.66] You know, today,
[2813.82 → 2816.48] we've read about the church
[2816.48 → 2819.82] just after the Holy Spirit came
[2819.82 → 2821.78] in a new way at Pentecost.
[2821.78 → 2825.52] And it gives us something beautiful to long for.
[2826.18 → 2828.36] And it gives us something beautiful to imagine.
[2829.16 → 2830.68] And we should even ask ourselves
[2830.68 → 2833.00] if we really are a church,
[2833.04 → 2835.20] if these things that we see in this passage
[2835.20 → 2836.50] don't describe us.
[2837.86 → 2839.68] But I will admit to you
[2839.68 → 2841.94] that it can also be discouraging
[2841.94 → 2845.48] as we compare ourselves with them.
[2846.46 → 2846.82] Right?
[2846.82 → 2848.30] Rather than being encouraged
[2848.30 → 2848.98] and inspired
[2848.98 → 2851.16] to pursue this kind of community,
[2851.72 → 2854.46] we can get critical of ourselves
[2854.46 → 2856.08] and of our life together.
[2857.18 → 2858.72] So I think we need to see
[2858.72 → 2860.50] that the Bible is honest.
[2860.92 → 2861.74] Because actually,
[2862.02 → 2864.00] in the following chapters of Acts
[2864.00 → 2865.56] and in the rest of the New Testament,
[2865.70 → 2867.20] we find that the earliest church
[2867.20 → 2868.40] wasn't perfect.
[2868.92 → 2871.48] It actually had our problems too.
[2872.40 → 2872.62] Right?
[2872.66 → 2873.60] It wasn't long before
[2873.60 → 2874.50] they were arguing
[2874.50 → 2875.68] over the apostles' teaching.
[2875.68 → 2878.26] It wasn't long before
[2878.26 → 2879.64] the Greek widows
[2879.64 → 2880.90] were complaining
[2880.90 → 2882.12] that the Jewish widows
[2882.12 → 2883.30] were getting treated better
[2883.30 → 2883.92] in the fellowship.
[2884.58 → 2886.24] It wasn't long before
[2886.24 → 2888.72] Jews wouldn't eat
[2888.72 → 2889.82] with the Gentiles
[2889.82 → 2890.54] that were being added
[2890.54 → 2891.36] into the church.
[2892.22 → 2893.48] It wasn't long before
[2893.48 → 2894.40] they were not enjoying
[2894.40 → 2895.62] the favour of all the people.
[2896.08 → 2896.72] But instead,
[2896.88 → 2897.74] they were experiencing
[2897.74 → 2899.02] real persecution
[2899.02 → 2900.72] for the name of Jesus.
[2902.24 → 2903.76] And so here's what I think
[2903.76 → 2905.14] we should take from this passage.
[2906.34 → 2907.32] Don't wish
[2907.32 → 2908.52] that you lived
[2908.52 → 2909.66] in some golden age
[2909.66 → 2910.24] of the church.
[2911.56 → 2913.40] And don't look at the church today
[2913.40 → 2914.44] and be only critical.
[2915.08 → 2917.00] Because we are a group
[2917.00 → 2917.80] of sinners
[2917.80 → 2919.48] who look together
[2919.48 → 2920.62] towards our Saviour.
[2920.76 → 2921.58] That's the church.
[2922.06 → 2923.40] We're not a perfect community.
[2923.80 → 2924.52] We're a community
[2924.52 → 2926.06] that is being saved
[2926.06 → 2927.20] and informed
[2927.20 → 2928.16] by the Holy Spirit.
[2929.26 → 2930.68] And so with the Holy Spirit's help,
[2930.68 → 2932.26] we are together
[2932.26 → 2933.38] becoming and growing
[2933.38 → 2934.36] into a community
[2934.36 → 2935.78] that listens
[2935.78 → 2936.48] to the teachings
[2936.48 → 2937.06] of the Bible.
[2937.42 → 2938.40] And we're growing
[2938.40 → 2939.14] into a community
[2939.14 → 2941.38] that hungers for it
[2941.38 → 2942.74] and is nourished by it.
[2943.70 → 2944.80] We are growing
[2944.80 → 2946.12] into a thick community
[2946.12 → 2947.40] of generous
[2947.40 → 2948.66] and loving fellowship.
[2949.58 → 2950.36] We are becoming
[2950.36 → 2951.02] a community
[2951.02 → 2952.26] that is contagious
[2952.26 → 2953.36] and that is making room
[2953.36 → 2954.00] for people
[2954.00 → 2955.58] who are distant from God
[2955.58 → 2956.28] to come
[2956.28 → 2957.74] and to know Him.
[2957.74 → 2959.86] And so just like
[2959.86 → 2961.72] the first imperfect church
[2961.72 → 2962.34] in Jerusalem,
[2962.80 → 2964.04] we also need
[2964.04 → 2964.60] the presence
[2964.60 → 2965.24] and the power
[2965.24 → 2966.02] of the Spirit
[2966.02 → 2967.16] of God
[2967.16 → 2968.60] to be at work among us.
[2969.20 → 2970.62] So let me pray for us.
[2973.32 → 2974.34] Heavenly Father,
[2974.50 → 2975.62] we thank you again
[2975.62 → 2977.46] for this beautiful
[2977.46 → 2978.76] picture of community.
[2979.46 → 2980.88] This is what the church is,
[2980.94 → 2981.50] a community
[2981.50 → 2982.96] of learning,
[2983.12 → 2983.80] of growing,
[2984.42 → 2985.32] of generosity
[2985.32 → 2986.20] and love.
[2986.20 → 2988.34] like a thick community,
[2988.72 → 2989.24] a community
[2989.24 → 2990.56] that is a blessing
[2990.56 → 2991.24] to their neighbours,
[2991.30 → 2992.38] all of these things.
[2993.30 → 2993.64] And Lord,
[2993.76 → 2994.24] right now,
[2994.30 → 2994.92] we don't have
[2994.92 → 2995.80] our Sunday gathering,
[2996.34 → 2997.56] but we are still the church.
[2998.22 → 2999.30] We can still grow
[2999.30 → 3000.34] in all of these ways.
[3000.42 → 3001.26] We can still practice
[3001.26 → 3002.52] all of these things together,
[3002.60 → 3003.26] even though it's a bit
[3003.26 → 3004.02] harder right now.
[3004.98 → 3005.74] So Lord,
[3005.84 → 3006.56] even now,
[3006.98 → 3008.04] we pray that
[3008.04 → 3009.52] mysteriously,
[3010.12 → 3010.96] by your Spirit,
[3011.46 → 3012.72] that you would grow
[3012.72 → 3014.08] Latin or CRC.
[3014.08 → 3015.66] that when we come
[3015.66 → 3016.28] back together,
[3016.28 → 3018.02] we would be strong,
[3018.30 → 3019.36] that we would have
[3019.36 → 3020.84] grown in all of these ways,
[3021.86 → 3023.08] and that it would be amazing
[3023.08 → 3024.18] that what we see
[3024.18 → 3025.26] you doing among us.
[3025.80 → 3027.28] We pray for your Spirit
[3027.28 → 3028.08] in Jesus' name.
[3028.70 → 3028.94] Amen.
[3029.84 → 3030.82] So now let's
[3030.82 → 3032.12] sing our song
[3032.12 → 3033.02] of response together.
[3033.02 → 3034.02] Father.
[3045.02 → 3046.66] Know we are Christians
[3046.66 → 3047.68] by our love.
[3047.68 → 3051.68] by our love.
[3051.68 → 3052.68] Amen.
[3054.68 → 3057.94] We are one in the Spirit.
[3058.28 → 3060.66] We are one in the Lord.
[3060.88 → 3063.52] We are one in the Spirit.
[3063.80 → 3066.26] We are one in the Lord.
[3066.58 → 3069.44] And we pray that all unity
[3069.44 → 3071.90] may one day be restored.
[3072.32 → 3074.98] And though we are Christians
[3074.98 → 3076.28] by our love,
[3076.28 → 3077.74] by our love,
[3078.06 → 3079.14] we still know
[3079.14 → 3080.70] we are Christians
[3080.70 → 3083.34] by our love.
[3084.36 → 3087.20] We will walk with each other,
[3087.42 → 3089.98] we will walk hand in hand.
[3090.14 → 3092.92] We will walk with each other,
[3093.12 → 3095.70] we will walk hand in hand.
[3096.04 → 3099.18] And together we'll spread the news
[3099.18 → 3101.40] that God is in our land.
[3101.74 → 3103.06] And they'll know
[3103.06 → 3104.44] we are Christians
[3104.44 → 3105.80] by our love,
[3105.80 → 3107.22] by our love.
[3107.22 → 3108.64] Yes, they'll know
[3108.64 → 3110.24] we are Christians
[3110.24 → 3112.82] by our love.
[3113.86 → 3116.72] We will walk with each other,
[3116.86 → 3119.30] we will walk side by side.
[3119.30 → 3122.22] We will walk with each other,
[3122.36 → 3124.92] we will walk side by side.
[3125.18 → 3128.02] And we'll guard each one's dignity
[3128.02 → 3130.66] and save each one's pride.
[3130.98 → 3132.32] And they'll know
[3132.32 → 3133.70] we are Christians
[3133.70 → 3135.06] by our love,
[3135.06 → 3136.06] by our love.
[3136.06 → 3137.90] Yes, they'll know
[3137.90 → 3139.50] we are Christians
[3139.50 → 3142.06] by our love.
[3143.22 → 3146.20] All praise to the Father
[3146.20 → 3148.84] whom all faiths come.
[3149.06 → 3152.00] And all praise to Christ Jesus,
[3152.34 → 3154.36] His only Son.
[3154.70 → 3157.34] And all praise to the Spirit
[3157.34 → 3160.08] who makes you one.
[3160.08 → 3161.80] And they'll know
[3161.80 → 3163.10] we are Christians
[3163.10 → 3164.48] by our love,
[3164.62 → 3166.02] by our love.
[3166.26 → 3167.42] Yes, they'll know
[3167.42 → 3168.96] we are Christians
[3168.96 → 3171.08] by our love.
[3177.08 → 3177.96] So we are now
[3177.96 → 3179.14] at a point in the service
[3179.14 → 3181.18] where we get to go before God
[3181.18 → 3182.68] with our needs,
[3182.96 → 3183.88] with our requests,
[3184.92 → 3186.44] trusting that He hears us,
[3186.76 → 3188.10] that He sees us,
[3188.10 → 3190.18] and that He would respond in love.
[3191.02 → 3191.98] And so let's bring our needs
[3191.98 → 3192.78] before Him now.
[3192.98 → 3194.42] Let's please pray with me.
[3194.42 → 3198.56] Father,
[3198.68 → 3199.38] you promise
[3199.38 → 3202.18] that blessed is the poor
[3202.18 → 3202.84] in spirit,
[3203.08 → 3204.24] for theirs is the kingdom
[3204.24 → 3204.96] of heaven.
[3206.54 → 3208.16] All those who know
[3208.16 → 3209.68] that they come to you
[3209.68 → 3210.50] empty-handed
[3210.50 → 3212.16] and are in need
[3212.16 → 3212.92] of your grace
[3212.92 → 3214.30] here and around the world,
[3214.44 → 3214.68] Lord,
[3214.76 → 3215.50] would you bring them
[3215.50 → 3216.20] into your kingdom?
[3217.16 → 3218.00] Would you anchor
[3218.00 → 3218.68] all of us
[3218.68 → 3219.80] amidst this season
[3219.80 → 3220.54] of disruption
[3220.54 → 3221.42] and suffering?
[3221.42 → 3223.88] Would you anchor us
[3223.88 → 3224.52] in the hope
[3224.52 → 3226.62] of your eternal kingdom
[3226.62 → 3228.72] and that you meet us
[3228.72 → 3229.84] in your grace?
[3231.82 → 3232.40] Father,
[3232.56 → 3233.04] you say
[3233.04 → 3234.18] that blessed is those
[3234.18 → 3235.00] who mourn,
[3235.74 → 3237.72] for they will be comforted.
[3238.72 → 3239.30] Father,
[3239.40 → 3240.34] we bring before you
[3240.34 → 3241.42] those who are mourning
[3241.42 → 3243.24] for the pain
[3243.24 → 3243.98] caused
[3243.98 → 3245.68] by a fallen world,
[3246.46 → 3247.64] whether that pain
[3247.64 → 3248.40] is physical
[3248.40 → 3249.36] in our bodies,
[3249.98 → 3250.70] emotional,
[3250.70 → 3251.60] spiritual,
[3251.80 → 3252.32] or relational.
[3253.32 → 3253.72] Lord,
[3253.80 → 3254.34] please comfort
[3254.34 → 3255.14] all those
[3255.14 → 3255.86] who are mourning
[3255.86 → 3257.00] among us
[3257.00 → 3258.22] with the comfort
[3258.22 → 3259.24] of your love
[3259.24 → 3260.34] and your presence.
[3261.92 → 3262.70] And Father,
[3262.82 → 3263.36] you promise
[3263.36 → 3264.00] that blessed
[3264.00 → 3264.96] are the meek,
[3265.64 → 3267.08] for they will
[3267.08 → 3268.02] inherit the earth.
[3269.64 → 3270.06] And Lord,
[3270.12 → 3270.84] we are facing
[3270.84 → 3271.98] so many questions
[3271.98 → 3272.86] about what it means
[3272.86 → 3273.74] to live well
[3273.74 → 3274.96] and rightly
[3274.96 → 3276.32] right now
[3276.32 → 3277.10] in our world
[3277.10 → 3277.90] and in our country
[3277.90 → 3278.56] and in our city.
[3278.56 → 3280.42] So Lord,
[3280.46 → 3281.36] we seek your wisdom
[3281.36 → 3282.54] to guide us
[3282.54 → 3283.44] as we consider
[3283.44 → 3285.28] issues of medical safety,
[3285.94 → 3287.00] as we consider
[3287.00 → 3288.72] issues of our economy,
[3289.98 → 3291.80] issues of racial injustice.
[3292.80 → 3294.14] And it is easy
[3294.14 → 3294.82] to assume
[3294.82 → 3296.04] the worst of each other.
[3297.18 → 3297.94] It's easy
[3297.94 → 3299.66] to be defensive
[3299.66 → 3300.52] and angry.
[3301.56 → 3302.34] So Lord,
[3302.44 → 3303.58] help us to be meek.
[3304.68 → 3305.68] Help us to live
[3305.68 → 3306.86] in the world
[3306.86 → 3308.60] sure of who you are
[3308.60 → 3310.10] and sure of what
[3310.10 → 3311.12] you have done
[3311.12 → 3312.78] and what you are doing.
[3313.34 → 3313.68] Lord,
[3313.72 → 3314.64] we seek your truth
[3314.64 → 3315.16] in the hope
[3315.16 → 3315.76] that we would
[3315.76 → 3316.74] inherit the earth.
[3318.52 → 3319.32] And Father,
[3319.44 → 3319.84] you say,
[3319.94 → 3320.72] blessed are those
[3320.72 → 3321.26] who hunger
[3321.26 → 3321.78] and thirst
[3321.78 → 3322.48] for righteousness.
[3323.44 → 3323.94] Lord,
[3324.00 → 3324.62] would you grow
[3324.62 → 3325.22] that hunger
[3325.22 → 3325.96] and thirst
[3325.96 → 3326.70] in us
[3326.70 → 3327.18] as people
[3327.18 → 3327.88] who belong
[3327.88 → 3328.40] to you
[3328.40 → 3329.26] as the church.
[3330.66 → 3331.16] And so Lord,
[3331.24 → 3332.00] we must know
[3332.00 → 3333.00] what your righteousness
[3333.00 → 3333.64] is.
[3333.64 → 3334.92] we ask
[3334.92 → 3335.28] that you would
[3335.28 → 3336.18] open our eyes
[3336.18 → 3336.84] and our hearts
[3336.84 → 3337.68] to know you
[3337.68 → 3339.06] and to know
[3339.06 → 3340.42] the righteous life
[3340.42 → 3341.20] that you have
[3341.20 → 3342.14] called us to
[3342.14 → 3343.60] by your work
[3343.60 → 3344.06] in us.
[3344.76 → 3345.38] We ask
[3345.38 → 3345.80] that you would
[3345.80 → 3346.26] help us
[3346.26 → 3346.70] to know
[3346.70 → 3347.34] what to do
[3347.34 → 3348.20] as a church
[3348.20 → 3349.24] to pursue
[3349.24 → 3349.92] your righteousness
[3349.92 → 3351.68] for the sake
[3351.68 → 3352.34] of your glory.
[3354.22 → 3355.06] And Father,
[3355.20 → 3355.62] you say,
[3355.76 → 3357.06] blessed are the merciful
[3357.06 → 3358.10] for they will
[3358.10 → 3359.04] receive mercy.
[3360.12 → 3360.66] And so Lord,
[3360.72 → 3361.44] we ask that
[3361.44 → 3361.98] we would be
[3361.98 → 3363.02] a merciful church.
[3363.64 → 3364.92] that by your spirit
[3364.92 → 3365.60] you would make us
[3365.60 → 3366.14] a people
[3366.14 → 3367.36] who long
[3367.36 → 3369.10] to love one another
[3369.10 → 3370.52] and love our neighbour.
[3371.90 → 3372.54] So Lord,
[3372.60 → 3373.70] we ask you
[3373.70 → 3375.00] for these blessings
[3375.00 → 3377.00] so that we
[3377.00 → 3377.90] would be a blessing.
[3378.50 → 3379.70] We ask all of this
[3379.70 → 3380.60] in Christ's
[3380.60 → 3381.56] most holy name.
[3382.32 → 3382.66] Amen.
[3384.40 → 3385.66] So brothers and sisters,
[3385.66 → 3386.98] now as we
[3386.98 → 3388.88] come to the end
[3388.88 → 3390.02] of our worship
[3390.02 → 3390.68] today
[3390.68 → 3391.28] and as we
[3391.28 → 3391.90] are equipped
[3391.90 → 3392.72] to go out
[3392.72 → 3393.30] into the world,
[3393.38 → 3394.10] we go with
[3394.10 → 3396.36] the loving blessing
[3396.36 → 3397.42] of our Heavenly Father
[3397.42 → 3398.00] upon us,
[3398.06 → 3398.88] I invite you
[3398.88 → 3399.24] to hold out
[3399.24 → 3399.70] your hands
[3399.70 → 3400.46] for the benediction.
[3402.06 → 3402.64] A blessing
[3402.64 → 3403.42] and honour
[3403.42 → 3404.84] and glory
[3404.84 → 3405.64] and power
[3405.64 → 3406.84] belong to the one
[3406.84 → 3408.06] sitting on the throne
[3408.06 → 3408.86] and to the Lamb
[3408.86 → 3410.92] forever and ever.
[3411.50 → 3412.24] May the blessings
[3412.24 → 3412.96] of the Father
[3412.96 → 3413.86] and the Son
[3413.86 → 3414.90] and of the Holy Spirit
[3414.90 → 3415.78] be upon you
[3415.78 → 3417.12] and be with you.
[3417.64 → 3417.98] Amen.
[3417.98 → 3418.08] Amen.
[3418.08 → 3418.12] Amen.
[3418.12 → 3418.14] Amen.

[3418.22 → 3420.14] Amen.
[3420.14 → 3420.76] Emmen.
[3421.76 → 3423.08] Amen.
[3429.80 → 3431.72] Seconds forth
[3431.72 → 3433.64] by God's blessing
[3433.64 → 3435.50] are true faith
[3435.50 → 3436.92] confessing
[3436.92 → 3439.72] the people of God
[3439.72 → 3441.48] from this is panelling

[3461.78 → 3463.98] preaching, shall blossom
