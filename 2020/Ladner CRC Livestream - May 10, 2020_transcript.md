[0.00 --> 13.72]  Blessed be your name when I'm found in the desert place, though I walk through the wilderness.
[14.68 --> 16.08]  Blessed be your name.
[19.14 --> 26.02]  Every blessing you pour out, all time back to praise.
[26.02 --> 34.08]  And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say,
[34.60 --> 37.96]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38.30 --> 40.80]  Blessed be your name.
[42.40 --> 46.28]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46.94 --> 50.34]  Blessed be your glorious name.
[50.34 --> 57.62]  Blessed be your name.
[57.94 --> 61.64]  When the sun's shining down on me.
[62.06 --> 65.34]  When the world's all as it should be.
[66.40 --> 67.80]  Blessed be your name.
[70.80 --> 73.82]  Blessed be your name.
[73.82 --> 77.54]  On the road marked with suffering.
[78.28 --> 81.62]  Though there's pain in the offering.
[82.58 --> 84.04]  Blessed be your name.
[84.40 --> 85.46]  Yes, Lord.
[87.06 --> 93.98]  Every blessing you pour out, all time back to praise.
[93.98 --> 101.98]  When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say,
[102.48 --> 105.86]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[106.42 --> 108.48]  Blessed be your name.
[110.36 --> 114.20]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[114.88 --> 118.20]  Blessed be your glorious name.
[118.20 --> 141.38]  To give and take away.
[141.38 --> 145.48]  To give and take away.
[145.48 --> 149.60]  My heart will choose to say.
[150.60 --> 153.90]  For blessed be your name.
[154.32 --> 157.76]  God, you give and take away.
[158.44 --> 162.04]  Oh, you give and take away.
[163.06 --> 166.12]  My heart will choose to say.
[167.22 --> 171.36]  For blessed be your name.
[171.46 --> 172.26]  I'll bless you.
[172.26 --> 172.98]  For blessed be your name.
[173.16 --> 198.42]  For blessed be your name.
[198.42 --> 199.46]  For blessed be their name.
[199.46 --> 216.00]  of the Lord. Blessed be your glory as the name. Blessed be your name. You give and take away.
[216.00 --> 228.58]  God, you give and take away. My heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be your name.
[228.58 --> 245.40]  God, you give and take away. You give and you take away. But my heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be your name.
[245.40 --> 257.54]  Oh, you give and take away. You give and take away. For you, God, my heart will choose to say,
[257.54 --> 263.98]  For you, God, we can take away. Amen.
[263.98 --> 270.40]  Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name.
[272.34 --> 280.16]  Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the glorious name.
[280.80 --> 284.44]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[284.44 --> 286.82]  Blessed be your name
[286.82 --> 292.70]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[292.70 --> 297.40]  Blessed be your glorious name
[297.40 --> 300.66]  Blessed be your name
[300.66 --> 311.36]  As we come today
[311.36 --> 315.36]  We remind ourselves of what we do
[315.36 --> 319.36]  That these songs are not just songs
[319.92 --> 323.36]  For signs of love for you
[323.36 --> 333.34]  As we come today
[333.34 --> 337.20]  We remind ourselves of what we do
[337.20 --> 341.20]  That these songs are not just songs
[341.20 --> 344.42]  For signs of love for you
[344.42 --> 349.08]  This is a holy moment now
[349.08 --> 352.94]  Something of heaven touches earth
[352.94 --> 356.32]  Voices of angels all resound
[356.32 --> 359.04]  We join this song
[359.04 --> 363.94]  Come, come, come
[363.94 --> 367.04]  Let us worship God
[367.64 --> 371.26]  With our hands held high
[371.26 --> 374.84]  And our hearts bow down
[374.84 --> 378.04]  We will run, run, run
[378.04 --> 382.28]  Through your gates, oh God
[382.28 --> 385.28]  With a shout of love
[385.28 --> 389.28]  With a shout of love
[389.28 --> 390.28]  With a shout of love
[390.28 --> 395.28]  With confidence
[395.28 --> 399.66]  We come before your throne of grace
[399.66 --> 403.66]  Not that we deserve to come
[403.66 --> 406.66]  But you have paved the way
[406.66 --> 411.54]  You are the holy king of all
[411.54 --> 414.66]  Heaven and earth are in your hands
[414.66 --> 418.60]  All of the angels sing your song
[418.60 --> 421.66]  We join them now
[421.66 --> 425.66]  Come, come, come, come
[425.66 --> 429.66]  Let us worship God
[429.66 --> 432.66]  With our hands held high
[432.66 --> 436.66]  And our hearts bow down
[436.66 --> 440.66]  We will run, run, run
[440.66 --> 443.66]  Through your gates, oh God
[443.66 --> 447.66]  With a shout of love
[447.66 --> 449.66]  With a shout of love
[449.66 --> 450.66]  With a shout of love
[450.66 --> 451.66]  Let us know
[451.66 --> 456.66]  We shout to the praise of the glory
[456.66 --> 458.66]  Let us know
[458.66 --> 460.66]  Let us know
[460.66 --> 461.66]  Let us know
[467.66 --> 470.66]  Let this be a holy moment now
[470.66 --> 472.66]  Let this be a holy moment now
[472.66 --> 474.66]  Let this be a holy moment now
[474.66 --> 479.14]  Now let this be a holy moment now.
[479.14 --> 482.84]  Let this be a holy moment now.
[483.58 --> 487.10]  Let me call it on your name today.
[489.80 --> 492.62]  Immerse us in your presence tonight, Lord.
[495.90 --> 497.44]  Lead us in.
[498.66 --> 501.38]  Come, come, come.
[501.38 --> 512.40]  Let us worship God with our hands held high and our hearts bow down.
[512.84 --> 519.76]  We will run, run, run through your gates, oh God.
[520.16 --> 527.58]  With a shout of love, with a shout of love, we will come.
[527.58 --> 530.70]  Come, come, come.
[530.98 --> 541.96]  Let us worship God with our hands held high and our hearts bow down.
[542.18 --> 549.28]  We will run, run, run through your gates, oh God.
[549.28 --> 552.66]  With a shout of love, we call.
[553.26 --> 559.76]  With a shout of love, with a shout of love.
[560.30 --> 566.72]  With a shout of love, with a shout of love.
[566.72 --> 571.54]  With a shout of love
[571.54 --> 574.52]  With a shout of love
[596.72 --> 626.70]  With a shout of love
[626.72 --> 630.20]  Many times
[630.20 --> 633.92]  I've wondered at your gift of life
[633.92 --> 637.30]  I'm in that place once again
[637.30 --> 643.42]  I'm in that place once again
[643.42 --> 647.20]  And once again
[647.20 --> 650.62]  I look upon the cross where you died
[650.62 --> 654.04]  I'm humbled by your mercy
[654.04 --> 656.68]  And I'm broken inside
[656.68 --> 660.42]  Once again I thank you
[660.42 --> 664.82]  Once again I pour out my life
[664.82 --> 668.30]  Pour out my life
[668.30 --> 681.76]  Now you are exalted to the highest place
[681.76 --> 683.88]  King of the heavens
[683.88 --> 686.66]  Where one day I'll bow
[686.66 --> 693.72]  But for now I marvel at this saving grace
[693.72 --> 697.08]  I'm full of praise once again
[697.08 --> 699.68]  Full of your praise today
[699.68 --> 704.14]  I'm full of praise once again
[704.14 --> 710.60]  And once again I look upon the cross where you died
[710.60 --> 710.76]  And once again I look upon the cross where you died
[710.76 --> 714.02]  I'm humbled by your mercy
[714.02 --> 716.66]  And I'm broken inside
[716.66 --> 720.38]  Once again I thank you
[720.38 --> 724.28]  Once again I pour out my life
[724.28 --> 726.02]  Oh I pour out my life
[726.02 --> 727.24]  Oh I pour out my life
[727.24 --> 728.02]  At your cross
[728.02 --> 734.56]  And once again I look upon the cross where you died
[734.56 --> 738.04]  Jesus I'm thankful for your mercy
[738.04 --> 740.56]  And I'm broken inside
[740.56 --> 744.30]  Once again I thank you
[744.30 --> 748.70]  Once again I pour out my life
[748.70 --> 754.76]  We bring our grateful hearts to you
[754.76 --> 759.44]  Thanking you Lord
[759.44 --> 768.26]  Your sacrifice
[768.26 --> 770.04]  We thank you Lord
[770.04 --> 778.60]  Thank you Lord
[778.60 --> 780.38]  Thank you God
[780.38 --> 782.80]  Thank you for the cross
[782.80 --> 785.52]  Thank you I thank you for the cross
[785.52 --> 789.16]  Thank you for the cross
[789.16 --> 791.76]  Thank you for the cross
[791.76 --> 795.50]  My friend
[795.50 --> 799.98]  yields
[799.98 --> 829.96]  Thank you for the cross.
[829.98 --> 834.16]  Thank you for the cross.
[834.42 --> 837.14]  Thank you for the cross.
[837.70 --> 841.56]  Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[845.82 --> 847.68]  My friend.
[859.98 --> 889.96]  My friend.
[889.98 --> 902.42]  Thank you for the cross.
[902.42 --> 905.76]  Good morning and welcome to this gracious church.
[907.28 --> 910.98]  Today is Mother's Day, a special day of honouring our mothers.
[912.04 --> 914.02]  This is actually a command from God.
[916.06 --> 921.90]  Honour your father and your mother that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God has given you.
[923.84 --> 926.52]  Today we can pay special attention to our mothers.
[926.52 --> 934.88]  With special treats, a phone call, or even recalling the influence they've had on our lives.
[935.68 --> 939.32]  A way of honouring those mothers no longer with us.
[940.54 --> 941.90]  May we honour them well.
[944.40 --> 952.30]  No matter where we are today, God invites us into his presence with these words from Psalm 95, verse 6.
[953.30 --> 956.06]  Come, let us worship and bow down.
[956.52 --> 960.94]  Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for he is our God.
[961.72 --> 966.06]  We are the people he watches over, the flock under his care.
[967.18 --> 973.84]  The God we worship is the one who has made us and desires to be in loving relationship with us.
[974.56 --> 980.04]  The one who heals and redeems us so that we can be in loving relationship with him.
[980.04 --> 987.24]  And the one who comes to live within us so that loving relationship is able to grow.
[988.20 --> 991.24]  This is the gracious God who welcomes us today.
[992.24 --> 1000.46]  A Father, Son, and Spirit God who faithfully invests himself in us and in our relationship with him.
[1000.46 --> 1005.12]  As we sing this song, let's consider these things.
[1005.12 --> 1024.74]  The gracious God, Father, desire of the world.
[1024.74 --> 1054.72]  The Lord, Son, and Spirit God who faithfully invests himself in us and in our life.
[1054.74 --> 1084.72]  The Lord, Son, and Spirit God who faithfully invests himself in us and in our life.
[1084.72 --> 1114.70]  The Lord, Son, and Spirit God who faithfully invests himself in us and in our life.
[1114.70 --> 1117.70]  Everything seems to be in us and in our life.
[1117.70 --> 1117.72]  Everything seems to be so long.
[1117.72 --> 1127.12]  Tender whispers, touch your hearts, flooding us with peace.
[1127.12 --> 1135.08]  The secret into our souls, make our strivings we.
[1135.08 --> 1140.08]  God greets us with grace, mercy, and peace.
[1140.08 --> 1151.26]  God greets us with his grace, mercy, and peace available to us through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1151.26 --> 1156.84]  Although we can't extend greetings to each other beyond those in our household today,
[1157.22 --> 1162.28]  think about someone you might call after the service as a way of extending the hand of fellowship.
[1163.74 --> 1164.72]  Got somebody?
[1165.36 --> 1165.94]  Good.
[1165.94 --> 1167.54]  Let's sing together.
[1195.94 --> 1225.92]  Let's sing together.
[1225.94 --> 1255.92]  Let's sing together.
[1255.94 --> 1285.92]  Let's sing together.
[1285.94 --> 1287.94]  Let's sing together.
[1287.94 --> 1291.94]  Let's sing together.
[1291.94 --> 1293.94]  Let's sing together.
[1293.94 --> 1299.94]  Let's sing together.
[1299.94 --> 1301.94]  Let's sing together.
[1301.94 --> 1305.94]  Let's sing together.
[1305.94 --> 1313.94]  Let's sing together.
[1313.94 --> 1321.94]  Let's sing together.
[1321.94 --> 1323.94]  Let's sing together.
[1323.94 --> 1329.94]  Let's sing together.
[1329.94 --> 1331.94]  Let's sing together.
[1331.94 --> 1337.94]  Let's sing together.
[1337.94 --> 1339.94]  Let's sing together.
[1339.94 --> 1341.94]  Let's sing together.
[1341.94 --> 1347.94]  Let's sing together.
[1347.94 --> 1349.94]  Let's sing together.
[1349.94 --> 1351.94]  Let's sing together.
[1351.94 --> 1359.94]  Let's sing together.
[1359.94 --> 1369.94]  Let's sing together.
[1369.94 --> 1371.94]  Let's sing together.
[1371.94 --> 1373.94]  Let's sing together.
[1373.94 --> 1375.94]  Let's sing together.
[1375.94 --> 1377.94]  Let's sing together.
[1377.94 --> 1385.94]  Let's sing together.
[1385.94 --> 1387.94]  Let's sing together.
[1387.94 --> 1389.94]  Let's sing together.
[1389.94 --> 1391.94]  Let's sing together.
[1391.94 --> 1393.94]  Let's sing together.
[1393.94 --> 1395.94]  Let's sing together.
[1395.94 --> 1397.94]  Let's sing together.
[1397.94 --> 1403.94]  Let's sing together.
[1403.94 --> 1408.74]  families by refusing to do our share of the family tasks.
[1408.74 --> 1413.30]  Father, we have sinned, forgive us.
[1413.30 --> 1419.54]  For the times we were unkind and impatient with those who needed our time and concern.
[1419.54 --> 1423.38]  Father, we have sinned, forgive us.
[1423.38 --> 1431.14]  For the times we were too weak to stand up for what was right and allowed others to suffer because of our cowardice.
[1431.14 --> 1434.82]  Father, we have sinned, forgive us.
[1434.82 --> 1438.82]  For the times we refused to forgive others.
[1438.82 --> 1444.34]  Father, we have sinned, forgive us. Amen.
[1444.34 --> 1446.90]  Now we have this assurance.
[1446.90 --> 1450.02]  Jesus has already paid for our sins.
[1450.02 --> 1456.50]  When we sincerely come to him in confession, he promises that we are forgiven and redeemed.
[1456.50 --> 1459.86]  1 John 1, verse 9 says,
[1459.86 --> 1469.86]  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[1469.86 --> 1473.46]  We take hold of this forgiveness and seek to live in the Spirit.
[1476.50 --> 1479.22]  We also come alive by hearing God's Word.
[1479.94 --> 1484.10]  Before we open scripture, let's sing a prayer of illumination.
[1484.10 --> 1486.10]  Having a sing and strength, let's sing a prayer of human mind,
[1486.10 --> 1488.10]  when we hear our sins, we are Aaah, great to see you.
[1488.10 --> 1490.10]  If we confess our sins, we are blessed in peace.
[1490.10 --> 1490.34]  We ask ourselves, Won the Lord God, we will forgive us.
[1490.34 --> 1498.00]  We ask myself, O Lord God, we are blessed because of all of our sins.
[1500.78 --> 1509.72]  Please try to worship our sins and wives surrounding us everything.
[1509.72 --> 1539.70]  Let us pray.
[1539.72 --> 1569.70]  Let us pray.
[1569.72 --> 1599.70]  Let us pray.
[1599.72 --> 1629.70]  Let us pray.
[1629.72 --> 1659.70]  Let us pray.
[1659.70 --> 1689.68]  Let us pray.
[1689.70 --> 1719.68]  Let us pray.
[1719.68 --> 1749.66]  Let us pray.
[1749.66 --> 1779.64]  Let us pray.
[1779.64 --> 1781.64]  Let us pray.
[1781.64 --> 1785.64]  Let us pray.
[1785.64 --> 1787.64]  Let us pray.
[1787.64 --> 1815.62]  Let us pray.
[1816.06 --> 1822.92]  So, Lord, help us to look this morning at this very familiar psalm in maybe a new way.
[1823.64 --> 1826.02]  And Lord, help us to draw closer to you.
[1826.42 --> 1827.60]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1828.06 --> 1828.38]  Amen.
[1828.38 --> 1841.52]  And so, my kids, and so, my kids love animals, what would you want to be?
[1841.52 --> 1855.48]  If you could be, if you could be, what would you want to be?
[1855.48 --> 1885.48]  And when we're going to be, what would you want to be, what would you want to be, what would you
[1885.48 --> 1897.28]  mean by say, especially, why don't you say, that's just a natural symbol here, what would you want to be, what would you like to do with you?
[1897.28 --> 1901.44]  So here is thegemony of the book, the waving, and you're going to be, what would you like to be when you are?
[1901.44 --> 1907.44]  I once heard a large animal veterinarian say that sheep are basically born looking for a place to die.
[1908.38 --> 1913.76]  They're completely helpless animals, and they get themselves into trouble all the time.
[1915.42 --> 1921.72]  But in order for us to really understand this psalm, we need to see something that is true about us.
[1922.56 --> 1925.74]  The psalm uses this image of God being our shepherd.
[1925.74 --> 1932.78]  So, if the Lord is my shepherd, what does that make me?
[1934.28 --> 1935.46]  It makes me a sheep.
[1936.68 --> 1943.14]  See, David, who wrote this psalm, he tended his father's flocks in the hills as a young boy.
[1943.64 --> 1949.14]  And he spent his childhood caring for the sheep and studying them and being with them.
[1949.14 --> 1958.30]  So, he thinks he's been a shepherd for so long that he knows pretty well how sheep think, how they behave, and what they really need.
[1959.00 --> 1967.12]  And so, he's writing this psalm to give us a picture of what life is like when the Lord, Yahweh, is your shepherd.
[1968.92 --> 1972.86]  Derek Kindner, in his commentary on the psalms, says this.
[1972.86 --> 1979.96]  The shepherd lives with his flock and is everything to them.
[1980.94 --> 1984.74]  Physician, guide, and protector.
[1985.70 --> 1989.38]  And I just thought that image was so powerful.
[1990.28 --> 1995.46]  And so, we're going to look at this psalm in these three movements this morning.
[1995.56 --> 1999.00]  That God is everything to us, the sheep.
[1999.10 --> 2000.12]  He is our physician.
[2000.12 --> 2004.44]  He is our guide, and we'll use the word pioneer since it starts with P.
[2005.18 --> 2006.10]  And our protector.
[2006.26 --> 2008.28]  He is our physician, our pioneer, and protector.
[2009.66 --> 2014.44]  And God is inviting you to come and be honest.
[2015.36 --> 2018.86]  You are a sheep, and you need a good shepherd.
[2019.88 --> 2025.38]  You need a good shepherd who knows what you really need and can provide it.
[2025.38 --> 2030.26]  Because, admit it, you're a sheep, not a nutritionist.
[2030.90 --> 2035.04]  And you need a good shepherd who knows the right paths to take and can lead you.
[2035.46 --> 2039.62]  Because, admit it, you're a sheep, not a navigator.
[2040.62 --> 2045.54]  And you need a good shepherd who knows your enemies and can protect you from danger.
[2045.54 --> 2050.22]  Because, admit it, you're a sheep, not a ninja.
[2051.74 --> 2056.02]  And so, what is it like to be a sheep under God's care?
[2056.36 --> 2058.00]  That's the question for us this morning.
[2058.80 --> 2060.40]  And so, let's look at these three movements.
[2061.00 --> 2066.04]  And the first one is that you're a sheep, not a nutritionist.
[2066.04 --> 2073.38]  But, God is a physician who knows what his sheep need and can provide it for them.
[2074.38 --> 2076.12]  So, look at verses 1 and 2.
[2077.00 --> 2079.78]  The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[2080.46 --> 2082.98]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[2083.60 --> 2086.26]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[2087.22 --> 2088.68]  He refreshes my soul.
[2090.16 --> 2094.84]  Now, David is saying that because the Lord is my shepherd, I will lack nothing.
[2094.84 --> 2098.84]  And it's a picture of contentment.
[2099.54 --> 2103.24]  It's not saying that I'm never going to have any other wants or desires.
[2103.88 --> 2115.18]  What it says is that the very deep level primary longings and needs of my soul are going to be met in communion with God.
[2115.92 --> 2118.94]  So, there's a sense of contentment.
[2119.26 --> 2122.54]  Everything I truly need, God can provide for me.
[2122.54 --> 2126.02]  Because God knows what I really need.
[2126.76 --> 2129.20]  And he is dedicated to my well-being.
[2130.30 --> 2138.72]  Now, the thing about sheep is that they have no concept at all of what is good food or where to find still water.
[2139.38 --> 2145.58]  Sheep are totally dependent on the shepherd to find grassy meadows with plants that won't harm them.
[2145.58 --> 2154.74]  And sheep need the shepherd to lead them to water that's quiet and still enough for them to drink from where they won't drown.
[2155.44 --> 2158.24]  They are virtually helpless without the shepherd.
[2159.64 --> 2162.36]  You know, sheep think they know what they need.
[2162.36 --> 2168.82]  But the good shepherd knows that sheep will eat poisonous plants if you're not watching over them.
[2169.90 --> 2181.28]  And so, when a shepherd brings his flock into a new pasture, the shepherd goes ahead and he weeds out all the harmful, toxic plants so that the sheep won't eat them.
[2181.28 --> 2187.30]  And like a shepherd, we also think we know what we need.
[2188.36 --> 2194.08]  You know, one of our most deeply embedded beliefs is that I know what I need.
[2194.22 --> 2195.96]  I know what will make me happy.
[2196.56 --> 2202.82]  And I can only trust myself to find my own happiness and fulfillment.
[2202.82 --> 2213.94]  But most of us will admit in our search for our own happiness and fulfillment that we are prone to eating toxic stuff as well.
[2214.90 --> 2217.70]  We don't know what we need.
[2218.10 --> 2223.72]  So we eat anything in front of us trying to find something that will actually satisfy us.
[2224.14 --> 2229.18]  And we end up hurting ourselves, going after things that will make us happy and satisfied.
[2229.18 --> 2240.72]  You know, when sheep think they know what they need, but if you're not watching over them, they will ruin an entire pasture by overgrazing if you leave them there too long.
[2241.82 --> 2252.44]  And just like a sheep, you know, not only do I eat toxic plants, but I'm greedy and I will even overdo things that are good for me.
[2252.44 --> 2258.42]  But it says, the Lord restores my soul.
[2259.08 --> 2259.32]  Right?
[2259.42 --> 2263.32]  We see this picture of soul refreshment.
[2263.94 --> 2271.12]  I don't know what that looks like for you, but the image the psalm gives us is green pastures and still waters.
[2272.40 --> 2278.56]  You know, I have a list of things that I think I need for soul refreshment.
[2278.56 --> 2288.86]  But actually, and quite honestly, some of those things are born out of entitlement or selfishness.
[2289.82 --> 2292.04]  You know, I say, I've been working hard.
[2292.30 --> 2293.60]  I deserve this.
[2294.56 --> 2299.20]  You know, or, you know, things are really stressful that are happening right now.
[2299.26 --> 2302.72]  And I think I need this to refresh my soul.
[2302.72 --> 2314.84]  And so often when I take the selfish route, I actually find that my soul is just as irritable and discontent after engaging in that than before.
[2316.32 --> 2319.62]  So I have to remember, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2320.74 --> 2325.92]  He knows what actually refills my soul and satisfies me.
[2326.34 --> 2328.60]  He knows what refreshes my spirit.
[2328.60 --> 2331.10]  Because he is my physician.
[2332.12 --> 2339.92]  I can trust him to bring deep soul level contentment to me when I trust him for everything that I need.
[2341.76 --> 2344.32]  And so that's the first thing that we see.
[2344.78 --> 2347.62]  That you are a sheep, not a nutritionist.
[2348.16 --> 2350.12]  Second, you're a sheep.
[2350.24 --> 2351.34]  You're not a navigator.
[2351.34 --> 2359.46]  But God is the pioneer, the guide who knows where his sheep need to go and will lead them there.
[2360.52 --> 2361.84]  So we look at verse 3.
[2362.02 --> 2362.38]  It says,
[2362.96 --> 2367.20]  He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.
[2368.48 --> 2374.80]  The idea here is of a sheep who has wandered away from the shepherd and has put itself into great danger.
[2375.78 --> 2380.26]  You know, sheep have a habit of wandering away from the flock.
[2380.26 --> 2383.44]  But they don't actually intend to.
[2383.56 --> 2384.88]  They're not being mischievous.
[2385.78 --> 2390.96]  You know, often what will happen is that a sheep becomes interested in one clump of grass.
[2391.40 --> 2393.62]  And then another one further away.
[2393.74 --> 2397.24]  So it has its head down and is just eating and munching and walking along.
[2397.70 --> 2404.18]  Until finally it looks up and discovers that it has strayed far from the shepherd and far from the flock.
[2404.18 --> 2408.12]  When night comes, the lost sheep is in great danger.
[2408.80 --> 2414.06]  Because there are wolves and lions lurking in the darkness, hungry for a meal.
[2415.48 --> 2422.56]  And if the wild animals don't eat at first, the sheep may wander off a cliff because it can't see in the dark.
[2422.56 --> 2431.64]  So when a shepherd gathers the sheep at the end of the day, he counts the sheep to make sure that they're all accounted for.
[2432.28 --> 2435.52]  And if he discovers that one of the sheep is still out in the wild,
[2435.52 --> 2440.30]  he leaves the rest of the flock with a trusted servant.
[2441.20 --> 2446.60]  And he trudges back over the route that he and the flock had traveled that day.
[2447.22 --> 2450.54]  And he carries a small lantern down close to his feet.
[2450.62 --> 2453.20]  And he retraces his steps.
[2453.30 --> 2454.88]  And he calls out for the sheep.
[2455.40 --> 2458.48]  And he listens for its cry in the darkness.
[2458.48 --> 2466.94]  And when he finds the animal, he places it on his shoulder and carries the sheep back to the sheepfold.
[2469.12 --> 2475.18]  And just like a sheep, we easily wander away from the shepherd.
[2476.32 --> 2481.00]  Now there might be times in your life when you wander away from God like a sheep.
[2481.00 --> 2489.44]  And praise be to God, this good shepherd doesn't say, you know, well that dumb sheep just wandered away again.
[2489.68 --> 2491.36]  I hope the wolves enjoy their dinner.
[2492.62 --> 2493.14]  No.
[2493.66 --> 2496.22]  The good shepherd says, you know what?
[2496.42 --> 2501.30]  I am going to leave the 99 here and I'm going to go after the one that wandered away.
[2501.74 --> 2503.22]  That's what the good shepherd does.
[2503.58 --> 2510.22]  He comes after us and pursues us even when we have wandered away from him.
[2511.00 --> 2520.78]  You know, maybe you've wandered and wandered until you look up and you realize that you are far away from the shepherd.
[2522.04 --> 2524.50]  But then God comes to you.
[2525.64 --> 2533.10]  Sometimes he sends a person in your life to encourage you and point you the way back to God.
[2534.00 --> 2540.46]  Sometimes he sends some sort of trial to make you realize that you are a sheep.
[2541.00 --> 2542.88]  You're not a navigator.
[2544.14 --> 2552.62]  And after he brings you back, you come to your senses and you realize, I have been a crazy, vulnerable sheep out there.
[2553.54 --> 2560.98]  But I have a good shepherd who looks after me and who brings me back even when I stray from him.
[2560.98 --> 2565.76]  You know, verse 4 continues and it says,
[2566.54 --> 2569.86]  Even though I walk through the darkest valley.
[2570.12 --> 2574.28]  You know, it may be the translation you're used to is the valley of the shadow of death.
[2575.08 --> 2575.86]  But it says,
[2575.86 --> 2589.48]  When God is your shepherd, sometimes he leads you to green pastures and quiet waters.
[2590.00 --> 2594.20]  But sometimes he leads you right through the dark valleys.
[2594.20 --> 2597.62]  Sometimes you're going to walk through dark times.
[2597.86 --> 2600.52]  You're going to walk through challenging times.
[2601.22 --> 2603.20]  And that's also part of his guidance.
[2604.06 --> 2610.40]  The dark valley is just as truly one of the right paths as are the green pastures.
[2611.30 --> 2612.90]  Of course, we prefer the green pastures.
[2612.90 --> 2621.72]  The image this psalm gives us is of walking through a steep and narrow ravine in the desert called a wadi.
[2622.78 --> 2628.86]  And in this ravine, it's dark and rocky and you're surrounded by shadows.
[2629.70 --> 2636.58]  And you can't tell in the shifting light whether, you know, that shadow over there is a lion about to pounce.
[2636.58 --> 2640.26]  Or if it's nothing at all to be afraid of.
[2641.86 --> 2644.14]  And I want you to see something really important.
[2645.46 --> 2646.88]  Notice what David does.
[2647.00 --> 2649.86]  The psalm begins with him talking about God.
[2650.52 --> 2650.94]  He says,
[2651.26 --> 2652.56]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[2653.22 --> 2656.04]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[2656.42 --> 2657.10]  He leads me.
[2657.22 --> 2658.24]  He restores me.
[2658.48 --> 2659.34]  Talking about God.
[2659.34 --> 2666.62]  But here in verse 4, David switches from talking about God to talking with God.
[2666.78 --> 2667.86]  To talking to God.
[2668.36 --> 2668.86]  He says,
[2669.60 --> 2671.40]  For you are with me.
[2672.28 --> 2677.20]  And so right in the midst of the dark valley, right in those times of fear and danger,
[2677.86 --> 2681.78]  that's when we can have the assurance that God is with us.
[2682.38 --> 2683.44]  You are with me.
[2684.42 --> 2686.52]  So we don't have to fear.
[2686.52 --> 2689.52]  We can be confident that God is present with us.
[2690.44 --> 2693.94]  And it's not talking about an escape from the dark valley.
[2694.66 --> 2694.80]  Right?
[2694.88 --> 2695.44]  Notice that.
[2696.56 --> 2702.90]  Rather, it's pointing to a peace that we have wherever God leads us.
[2702.92 --> 2703.98]  Because he is with me.
[2704.44 --> 2708.48]  So whether he leads me in the right paths of the green pastures,
[2708.76 --> 2712.48]  or the right paths of the dark valleys,
[2713.22 --> 2714.74]  God is present with me.
[2714.74 --> 2716.98]  He is my pioneer.
[2717.96 --> 2718.02]  Right?
[2718.10 --> 2719.46]  He knows the right paths.
[2719.92 --> 2720.94]  And he will lead me.
[2722.80 --> 2726.52]  And so the third movement this psalm gives us is to say
[2726.52 --> 2728.26]  that you're a sheep.
[2728.84 --> 2730.42]  You are not a ninja.
[2730.82 --> 2732.58]  As much as we would like to think we are.
[2734.28 --> 2736.96]  But God is our protector.
[2737.70 --> 2739.66]  He knows the enemies of the sheep.
[2739.66 --> 2742.22]  And he can protect us from danger.
[2743.14 --> 2744.44]  And so verse 4 says,
[2745.12 --> 2748.12]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[2749.32 --> 2752.56]  And so the rod is a weapon.
[2752.78 --> 2756.32]  It's a club that the shepherd would use to fight off predators.
[2756.32 --> 2760.42]  And so, you know, you might be the strongest sheep.
[2761.18 --> 2762.94]  You might be a tough sheep.
[2764.02 --> 2767.58]  But as far as sheep go, that is not saying very much.
[2768.10 --> 2774.26]  Because even the strongest sheep in the world would make an easy meal for a small wolf.
[2774.26 --> 2780.02]  And so where there are all kinds of enemies threatening to undo me,
[2780.66 --> 2784.28]  you realize that your shepherd is going to be able to fight off your enemies.
[2785.06 --> 2788.80]  And that is a great source of comfort and confidence.
[2790.48 --> 2792.12]  Then in verse 5, he says,
[2792.12 --> 2795.34]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[2796.26 --> 2798.10]  You anoint my head with oil.
[2798.74 --> 2800.40]  My cup overflows.
[2801.44 --> 2805.78]  Last summer, my family and I were on our way back from Tofino.
[2806.04 --> 2807.26]  And we were traveling along.
[2807.36 --> 2809.80]  And we stopped at this campsite for our lunch.
[2810.80 --> 2812.94]  And we're sitting at this picnic table.
[2813.12 --> 2815.32]  We're getting out our sandwiches and our chips.
[2815.90 --> 2818.70]  And all of a sudden, you know, a bee comes and it flies over.
[2819.30 --> 2820.42]  And it was kind of annoying.
[2820.56 --> 2821.78]  Like, you know, bees go away.
[2822.40 --> 2823.62]  But then a second one.
[2823.78 --> 2824.58]  And a third one.
[2824.66 --> 2825.12]  And a fourth.
[2825.28 --> 2826.96]  And then suddenly, there are bees everywhere.
[2827.42 --> 2828.44]  And so we take our food.
[2828.54 --> 2830.30]  And we're running away from the picnic table.
[2830.88 --> 2832.46]  And we think we're at a safe distance.
[2832.48 --> 2833.98]  But we're going to take a bite of our sandwich.
[2834.24 --> 2835.44]  And there's a bee in the sandwich.
[2835.90 --> 2838.30]  And so we have to just throw all of our food.
[2838.30 --> 2843.10]  And we're running through the park, getting away from these bees.
[2844.06 --> 2848.48]  But the people right next to us were sitting there quietly enjoying a meal.
[2848.60 --> 2850.00]  And the bees weren't bothering them at all.
[2850.00 --> 2853.20]  It seemed completely ridiculous.
[2853.56 --> 2858.28]  We were chased away back into our cars by this swarm of bees.
[2859.66 --> 2861.16]  And this verse made me think of that.
[2861.24 --> 2864.22]  That he prepares a table before us in the presence of our enemies.
[2864.76 --> 2866.20]  We can be like those other people.
[2866.78 --> 2867.76]  Enjoying their picnic.
[2867.76 --> 2870.14]  Even when there's predators all around.
[2871.44 --> 2877.54]  And this essentially is holding out these promises of who God is.
[2878.16 --> 2880.04]  And how he protects us.
[2880.58 --> 2884.90]  In a world that is vulnerable to change.
[2885.04 --> 2887.06]  Is vulnerable to attack.
[2887.48 --> 2888.98]  As we can see right now.
[2888.98 --> 2893.84]  But these promises of God are not vulnerable at all.
[2894.50 --> 2897.40]  They are promises that God is going to keep.
[2897.58 --> 2899.20]  Even in the midst of change.
[2899.30 --> 2902.62]  And even in the midst of enemies that are around us.
[2903.68 --> 2905.34]  So I want us to meditate on that.
[2906.48 --> 2910.08]  In times when we feel that things are under attack.
[2910.32 --> 2913.22]  And when the future is uncertain.
[2913.22 --> 2916.36]  God can prepare a meal for us.
[2916.44 --> 2918.18]  Even in the presence of our enemies.
[2919.14 --> 2920.62]  Because God is our protector.
[2921.50 --> 2923.92]  He knows who our enemies are.
[2924.02 --> 2925.44]  And he can protect us from danger.
[2927.60 --> 2931.18]  And so Psalm 23 is inviting us to admit that you're a sheep.
[2931.82 --> 2932.64]  I am a sheep.
[2933.42 --> 2933.68]  Right?
[2933.90 --> 2935.20]  You're not a nutritionist.
[2935.58 --> 2937.08]  You are not a navigator.
[2937.18 --> 2938.14]  And you are not a ninja.
[2939.02 --> 2940.48]  But God is our shepherd.
[2940.48 --> 2942.78]  He lives with his flock.
[2943.20 --> 2944.80]  And he is everything to them.
[2945.42 --> 2946.44]  He is their physician.
[2947.16 --> 2948.30]  He is their protector.
[2949.14 --> 2951.14]  He is their pioneer.
[2952.66 --> 2954.10]  And so as we close.
[2954.24 --> 2955.68]  I just want to remind us.
[2956.24 --> 2957.40]  Who this shepherd is.
[2958.12 --> 2959.74]  You know the shepherd is God of course.
[2960.64 --> 2962.64]  But the shepherd also comes to us.
[2962.84 --> 2964.42]  In a tremendous way.
[2964.52 --> 2965.40]  In the person of Jesus.
[2966.70 --> 2968.00]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[2968.16 --> 2969.40]  I lack nothing.
[2969.40 --> 2970.08]  Right?
[2970.80 --> 2973.14]  Nothing that I most essentially need.
[2973.32 --> 2974.98]  Will be withheld from me.
[2975.10 --> 2975.90]  Even in death.
[2976.58 --> 2978.28]  Even if the worst can happen.
[2979.10 --> 2983.92]  Because of the life and death and resurrection of the good shepherd.
[2984.30 --> 2985.02]  Jesus Christ.
[2986.30 --> 2988.28]  So in John chapter 10.
[2988.60 --> 2990.28]  Jesus gives us a picture.
[2991.10 --> 2993.98]  Of what the good shepherd really is.
[2994.12 --> 2995.16]  And so hear this.
[2995.16 --> 2997.42]  Jesus says.
[2998.08 --> 2999.36]  I am the good shepherd.
[2999.36 --> 3002.90]  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[3003.86 --> 3005.92]  The hired hand is not the shepherd.
[3006.16 --> 3007.50]  And does not own the sheep.
[3008.14 --> 3009.82]  So when he sees the wolf coming.
[3010.14 --> 3012.30]  He abandons the sheep and runs away.
[3012.76 --> 3015.60]  Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
[3016.86 --> 3019.84]  The man runs away because he is a hired hand.
[3019.94 --> 3021.36]  And cares nothing for the sheep.
[3021.36 --> 3023.44]  I am the good shepherd.
[3024.08 --> 3025.64]  I know my sheep.
[3026.04 --> 3027.16]  And my sheep know me.
[3027.70 --> 3029.36]  Just as the father knows me.
[3029.46 --> 3030.50]  And I know the father.
[3031.30 --> 3033.36]  And I lay down my life.
[3033.88 --> 3035.02]  For the sheep.
[3037.54 --> 3040.46]  Jesus has laid down his life for the sheep.
[3041.46 --> 3045.02]  We can know in the midst of whatever we're dealing with.
[3045.10 --> 3047.54]  Whatever we're dealing with as a country.
[3047.54 --> 3049.00]  As a community.
[3049.22 --> 3049.92]  Or as individuals.
[3050.70 --> 3052.00]  That Jesus is our shepherd.
[3053.30 --> 3054.90]  You know think about young David.
[3055.78 --> 3059.30]  Watching his father's sheep out on the hillside.
[3059.94 --> 3061.72]  You know it wasn't an easy job.
[3062.58 --> 3066.36]  He was literally risking his life for his sheep.
[3067.48 --> 3069.14]  In 1 Samuel.
[3070.16 --> 3071.90]  David comes to King Saul.
[3072.06 --> 3072.76]  And tells him.
[3073.16 --> 3075.16]  Hey I can kill the giant Goliath.
[3075.16 --> 3077.06]  So this is what David says to Saul.
[3077.88 --> 3078.16]  He says.
[3078.56 --> 3080.42]  I have been keeping my father's sheep.
[3080.58 --> 3081.38]  This is his resume.
[3081.98 --> 3083.22]  I've been keeping my father's sheep.
[3084.12 --> 3086.10]  When a lion or a bear came.
[3086.24 --> 3088.24]  And carried off a sheep from the flock.
[3088.90 --> 3090.08]  I went after it.
[3090.42 --> 3091.16]  Struck it.
[3091.60 --> 3093.32]  And rescued it from the sheep's mouth.
[3094.24 --> 3094.46]  Alright.
[3094.50 --> 3095.30]  That's pretty awesome.
[3096.80 --> 3098.24]  But now think about Jesus.
[3099.26 --> 3101.08]  Jesus didn't just risk his life.
[3101.16 --> 3103.22]  To rescue a sheep out of the mouth of a lion.
[3103.22 --> 3106.38]  Jesus gave his life on the cross.
[3106.80 --> 3108.38]  To rescue his sheep.
[3108.38 --> 3110.20]  Out of the mouth of death.
[3111.24 --> 3112.68]  Jesus on the cross.
[3112.96 --> 3115.54]  Laying down his life for the sheep.
[3116.18 --> 3119.50]  Has taken judgment on himself for us.
[3120.06 --> 3122.78]  He has taken death on himself for us.
[3123.32 --> 3126.18]  He has taken the brokenness of the world.
[3126.18 --> 3127.82]  On himself for us.
[3127.82 --> 3134.14]  So that we are absolutely and totally gospel free in Christ.
[3134.88 --> 3136.32]  Hidden in the good shepherd.
[3136.94 --> 3137.66]  Protected.
[3138.02 --> 3138.98]  Provided for.
[3139.98 --> 3142.76]  He is everything to us.
[3144.02 --> 3146.56]  Because he has laid down his life for us.
[3146.62 --> 3149.38]  We can lay down our lives for one another.
[3149.38 --> 3153.14]  Because our lives belong to him.
[3154.90 --> 3158.12]  So the psalm ends with verse 6.
[3158.38 --> 3158.88]  It says,
[3159.54 --> 3163.26]  Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
[3164.96 --> 3169.64]  Goodness and mercy will follow you as you are united to Christ.
[3170.38 --> 3170.52]  Right?
[3170.52 --> 3173.12]  So, no set of circumstances.
[3173.98 --> 3175.54]  No matter how challenging.
[3176.00 --> 3180.62]  Can keep us from the reality of God's goodness and love being present in my life.
[3181.64 --> 3186.66]  You know, so many times we pass through the worst moments of our lives.
[3187.50 --> 3194.88]  And we look back and we see shining examples of how goodness and love were still present with us.
[3194.88 --> 3195.78]  Right?
[3195.92 --> 3200.96]  Goodness and love were still there even when they were dark valleys.
[3202.98 --> 3204.52]  And lastly it says,
[3204.64 --> 3207.14]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[3208.06 --> 3212.04]  Literally nothing can separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ.
[3212.78 --> 3213.00]  Right?
[3213.10 --> 3213.98]  Nothing at all.
[3214.10 --> 3218.12]  Absolutely nothing can ultimately harm us.
[3219.46 --> 3224.12]  Jesus was with his disciples at the end of the Gospel of John and he said this.
[3224.88 --> 3226.64]  In this world you will have trouble.
[3227.34 --> 3230.48]  But take heart, I have overcome the world.
[3231.48 --> 3234.68]  It's just another way of saying what this psalm says.
[3235.50 --> 3241.98]  This psalm that is an anxiety-busting peace manual for all of life.
[3242.82 --> 3244.94]  The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[3245.70 --> 3248.88]  He walks with me in whatever situation of life I am in.
[3248.88 --> 3254.96]  So this prayer, this song of confidence works for kids.
[3255.68 --> 3258.68]  It works for people at the very end of their lives.
[3259.00 --> 3261.38]  And it works for all of us in between.
[3261.94 --> 3267.36]  We can put this song in our mouths and take up confidence in Jesus, our good shepherd,
[3267.64 --> 3270.08]  who laid down his life for us.
[3270.08 --> 3273.04]  So let me pray for you.
[3273.76 --> 3274.84]  Let's pray together.
[3276.18 --> 3280.36]  Our good shepherd, you care so much for us.
[3281.28 --> 3283.58]  You are our everything.
[3284.30 --> 3285.82]  You are our life.
[3286.48 --> 3288.48]  You are our confidence.
[3288.76 --> 3289.62]  You protect us.
[3289.70 --> 3290.66]  You care for us.
[3291.04 --> 3293.78]  So Lord, we can trust you.
[3294.46 --> 3297.18]  You are the good shepherd, not the hireling.
[3297.18 --> 3301.14]  Lord, help us to be confident in you.
[3301.76 --> 3308.94]  Lord, help us to take our anxiety and with this song in our mouths, may it dissipate.
[3309.92 --> 3314.44]  Lord, may our confidence rise as we lift up our eyes to our good shepherd.
[3315.22 --> 3316.96]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3317.58 --> 3317.86]  Amen.
[3317.86 --> 3317.96]  Amen.
[3327.18 --> 3327.76]  Amen.
[3331.76 --> 3331.82]  Amen.
[3331.82 --> 3332.50]  Amen.
[3335.46 --> 3336.02]  Amen.
[3336.02 --> 3336.24]  Amen.
[3336.24 --> 3336.32]  Amen.
[3336.32 --> 3336.98]  Amen.
[3340.38 --> 3341.54]  Amen.
[3341.54 --> 3342.54]  Amen.
[3371.54 --> 3373.54]  Amen.
[3401.54 --> 3403.54]  Amen.
[3431.54 --> 3433.54]  Amen.
[3461.54 --> 3463.54]  Amen.
[3463.54 --> 3465.54]  Amen.
[3466.54 --> 3467.54]  Amen.
[3471.54 --> 3473.54]  Amen.
[3473.54 --> 3475.54]  Amen.
[3483.54 --> 3488.62]  So we continue to worship God by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3488.62 --> 3493.12]  And our designated offering this week is World Renew.
[3493.62 --> 3500.80]  World Renew, their ministry includes disaster response, community development, and refugee sponsorship.
[3501.66 --> 3509.46]  And World Renew does not receive denominational ministry shares, and so it depends on the regular financial support of God's people.
[3510.34 --> 3515.52]  And so I encourage you to continue to worship the Lord with giving.
[3515.52 --> 3525.76]  And let us now spend some time bringing the needs of our congregation and the needs of the world before our Lord.
[3526.34 --> 3530.44]  So I ask that you would join me in this time of prayer.
[3530.44 --> 3539.76]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are good.
[3541.12 --> 3549.10]  And you are present here, even in the confines of our own homes and around the world.
[3549.10 --> 3568.44]  Lord, thinking here about our own congregation, we begin by praying simply for peace for those who are anxious.
[3568.44 --> 3572.62]  And for those whose futures feel uncertain.
[3573.72 --> 3578.50]  Patience for those who are frustrated or blocked in some way.
[3579.86 --> 3587.22]  We pray for the power to serve for those who are fatigued and yet called into service.
[3587.22 --> 3594.14]  And Lord, we pray for the provision of healing for those who are ill or sick.
[3594.78 --> 3598.68]  Especially, Lord, for Joan, for Tim, and for Kathy.
[3600.04 --> 3606.12]  And Lord, in the silence of our hearts, we name right now that pressing personal need
[3606.12 --> 3609.74]  that is perhaps only known to us and to you.
[3609.74 --> 3614.34]  But we lay it before you right now in the silence of our hearts.
[3626.18 --> 3631.72]  In opening our eyes, Lord, and looking around to Ladner and Delta,
[3632.30 --> 3634.82]  we know that there are abundant needs.
[3634.82 --> 3637.40]  Many needs which we can't see.
[3638.42 --> 3639.70]  But you see it all.
[3639.82 --> 3643.68]  And so, God, we ask that you would meet the daily needs of our neighbors.
[3644.28 --> 3647.64]  Like the need for food, the need for friendship.
[3649.12 --> 3653.56]  And Lord, we pray for the need for wisdom, for the leadership of our government,
[3654.08 --> 3659.86]  as they plan to ease restrictions and slowly reopen parts of the economy.
[3660.42 --> 3663.20]  So, God, help these leaders make wise decisions
[3663.20 --> 3666.24]  for the well-being of as many people as possible.
[3667.70 --> 3671.32]  And lastly, Lord, we pray for the spiritual needs of our neighbors as well.
[3671.94 --> 3677.76]  That you would enable men, women, and children to encounter the crucified and risen Christ
[3677.76 --> 3683.56]  through the presence and the witness of believers of Ladner CRC.
[3684.34 --> 3686.46]  Lord, come through your followers.
[3687.32 --> 3688.50]  Come through your word.
[3688.50 --> 3694.70]  Please come and make yourself visible and tangible and real and present, O Lord.
[3695.92 --> 3702.34]  And if there's a way you want us to be hands or feet or lips of Jesus to our neighbors,
[3703.18 --> 3706.04]  Lord, please show us and help us.
[3706.04 --> 3714.44]  Lord, particularly in light of COVID-19, we pray that you would reveal yourself ever more deeply to us,
[3714.52 --> 3715.10]  your followers.
[3715.90 --> 3722.56]  That as your people, we might be increasingly grounded in our knowledge and love of you
[3722.56 --> 3726.40]  and in confidence of your love and care for us.
[3727.52 --> 3731.70]  God, empower us during this time to be men and women and children
[3731.70 --> 3736.40]  who trust your goodness and delight to do your will
[3736.40 --> 3739.76]  for the sake of your kingdom purposes and your glory.
[3740.56 --> 3747.34]  We ask all of these things in the name of the crucified and risen Christ, our good shepherd.
[3748.06 --> 3748.38]  Amen.
[3748.38 --> 3756.40]  So now we go forth and enjoy the rest of our day,
[3756.88 --> 3761.40]  living out the purposes of God for us with his blessing upon us.
[3761.44 --> 3765.10]  So I invite you, wherever you sit, to hold out your hands
[3765.10 --> 3770.84]  as a gesture of receiving the care of our good shepherd.
[3771.40 --> 3772.72]  So here is our benediction.
[3772.72 --> 3777.08]  Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[3777.08 --> 3780.32]  brought back from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ,
[3780.88 --> 3782.44]  that great shepherd of the sheep,
[3783.10 --> 3785.96]  equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[3786.50 --> 3791.30]  And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ,
[3791.80 --> 3794.02]  to whom be glory forever and ever.
[3794.92 --> 3795.24]  Amen.
[3795.24 --> 3795.36]  Amen.
[3795.36 --> 3795.44]  Amen.
[3795.44 --> 3797.44]  Amen.
[3797.44 --> 3798.24]  Amen.
[3798.24 --> 3799.36]  Amen.
[3802.72 --> 3807.18]  Amen.
[3811.24 --> 3812.10]  Amen.
[3812.10 --> 3813.48]  Amen.
[3813.48 --> 3814.52]  Amen.
[3814.52 --> 3814.94]  Amen.
[3815.26 --> 3815.56]  Amen.
[3815.56 --> 3815.80]  Amen.
[3815.88 --> 3816.14]  Amen.
[3816.14 --> 3816.80]  Amen.
[3816.80 --> 3818.92]  Amen.
[3819.14 --> 3820.06]  Amen.
[3820.06 --> 3832.72]  The name of Jesus is here below, and still above in every cross,
[3832.72 --> 3840.18]  with Father's Son and Holy Ghost.
[3840.18 --> 3860.36]  The name of Jesus is here below, and still above in every cross,
[3860.36 --> 3869.82]  with Father's Son and Holy Ghost.
[3870.18 --> 3875.18]  Amen.
[3875.18 --> 3885.24]  It is God's Son to me.
[3885.24 --> 3890.46]  Ya�받и Him in the Son.
[3890.46 --> 3892.46]  you
