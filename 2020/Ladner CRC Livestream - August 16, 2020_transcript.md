[869.50 --> 876.38]  John, to this sacred office of elder, may he guide you by his word. Would he equip you with his spirit
[876.38 --> 884.20]  and grant you his wisdom, his humility in Christ, and courage, that his name would be glorified in
[884.20 --> 892.88]  your life and in your ministry. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. So I will give you a charge, John,
[892.88 --> 899.60]  and I will give a charge also to the congregation. So John, I charge you as a shepherd of the flock
[899.60 --> 906.38]  to hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that you can encourage others
[906.38 --> 914.54]  by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. These are Paul's words in Titus. So John,
[914.66 --> 920.18]  pray continually for the church and keep watch over your own life as you follow our Lord Jesus Christ.
[922.88 --> 933.56]  So now to the congregation. I charge you, people of God, to receive John Banstra as Christ's gift of
[933.56 --> 938.62]  leadership to the church and to recognize in him the Lord's loving and good provision
[938.62 --> 943.58]  and his care for our church family. So let's all pray together.
[945.82 --> 951.66]  Our merciful Father in heaven, we thank you that you have provided faithful and gifted leaders
[951.66 --> 958.36]  that you have chosen, that you have raised up to serve as elders and deacons, especially, Lord,
[958.44 --> 966.32]  today for John. As John assumes his responsibilities of being an elder and serving as clerk, Lord,
[966.42 --> 973.48]  fill him with your spirit, equip him with your wisdom, and empower him with your strength. Lord,
[973.54 --> 979.12]  we pray that you would make him a faithful worker in your church, that under his guidance,
[979.12 --> 986.00]  your church would grow in every spiritual grace, that through him, your gospel would grow and
[986.00 --> 991.88]  flourish in the lives of your people here at Ladner Christian Reformed Church. We pray all of these
[991.88 --> 998.36]  things in Jesus' name, the great shepherd of the sheep, the Lord over the church. Amen.
[998.36 --> 998.46]  Amen.
[998.46 --> 998.50]  Amen.
[998.50 --> 998.52]  Amen.
[998.52 --> 1000.52]  Amen.
[1000.52 --> 1001.00]  Amen.
[1001.00 --> 1001.04]  Amen.
[1001.04 --> 1001.08]  Amen.
[1009.12 --> 1010.12]  Amen.
[1039.12 --> 1039.70]  Amen.
[1039.74 --> 1039.88]  Amen.
[1040.12 --> 1040.42]  Amen.
[1040.52 --> 1040.78]  Amen.
[1040.86 --> 1041.12]  Amen.
[1041.16 --> 1041.62]  Amen.
[1041.74 --> 1049.54]  Amen.
[1049.60 --> 1051.10]  Amen.
[1051.10 --> 1062.64]  Amen.
[1062.64 --> 1064.74]  Amen.

[1067.96 --> 1068.86]  Amen.
[1068.86 --> 1068.98]  Amen.
[1068.98 --> 1069.06]  Amen.
[1069.06 --> 1069.08]  Amen.
[1069.12 --> 1078.34]  Your home is built on nothing else
[1078.34 --> 1085.22]  None is a blind and righteous name
[1085.22 --> 1091.62]  I did not trust the sweetest friend
[1091.62 --> 1097.52]  But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[1097.52 --> 1106.18]  Watch the Lord on us all
[1106.18 --> 1112.14]  Weak men saw the Savior's love
[1112.14 --> 1115.10]  Through this door
[1115.10 --> 1121.58]  He is Lord, Lord of God
[1121.58 --> 1131.24]  When darkness saves who had his face
[1131.24 --> 1138.34]  I rest on his unchanging grace
[1138.34 --> 1144.00]  In every heart and stormy care
[1144.00 --> 1150.00]  My anchor holds within the veil
[1150.00 --> 1158.66]  But God, Lord of God
[1158.66 --> 1165.08]  Hold us all, make me strong
[1165.08 --> 1167.66]  And the Savior's love
[1167.66 --> 1170.66]  Through this door
[1170.66 --> 1176.66]  He is Lord, Lord of God
[1176.66 --> 1187.64]  When he shall come with trumpet sound
[1187.64 --> 1193.32]  Oh, may I bend in him be found
[1193.32 --> 1200.32]  Trust in his righteousness alone
[1200.32 --> 1201.64]  Von der Eve
[1201.64 --> 1205.14]  Lord of God
[1205.14 --> 1209.92]  Du где המ
[1209.92 --> 1215.70] 妳 steigt no
[1215.70 --> 1220.30]  Segn'n ein
[1220.30 --> 1229.30]  Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[1229.30 --> 1237.26]  Watch the Lord for a stone
[1237.26 --> 1242.30]  Weakness, strong, and Savior's love
[1242.88 --> 1250.28]  Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[1250.28 --> 1260.28]  Amen
[1260.28 --> 1277.54]  Please pray with me, reading the bold type on the second slide.
[1278.54 --> 1280.48]  This is our prayer of confession.
[1283.22 --> 1289.74]  Heavenly Father, deep within, we know how we have failed to be your people.
[1290.74 --> 1294.50]  Our hardened hearts are closed to the love of Christ.
[1294.50 --> 1302.84]  Our lust for more and more blocks the fullness of your grace from transforming our lives.
[1302.84 --> 1308.84]  Our trust in the powers of the world reveals our foolish nature.
[1308.84 --> 1315.24]  Have mercy, God of every generation.
[1315.84 --> 1319.60]  Let us know your deep love for us in Jesus.
[1319.60 --> 1322.60]  Vast beyond all measure.
[1322.60 --> 1328.48]  Pour out the rich blessing of forgiveness on our parched souls.
[1328.48 --> 1331.48]  Shape us as your people.
[1331.48 --> 1343.42]  And restore us to faithful living as we seek to follow our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in service to everyone we meet.
[1343.42 --> 1345.42]  Let us sing this confession.
[1345.42 --> 1348.42]  Let us sing this confession.
[1348.42 --> 1351.42]  Let us sing this confession.
[1351.42 --> 1352.42]  Amen.
[1381.42 --> 1383.42]  Amen.
[1411.42 --> 1413.42]  Amen.
[1441.42 --> 1443.42]  Amen.
[1471.42 --> 1473.42]  Amen.
[1473.42 --> 1475.42]  Amen.
[1475.42 --> 1477.42]  Amen.
[1481.42 --> 1483.42]  Hear this assurance of pardon.
[1483.42 --> 1487.42]  The wideness of God's mercy.
[1487.42 --> 1491.42]  The range of God's forgiveness.
[1491.42 --> 1493.42]  The infinite love of God.
[1493.42 --> 1497.42]  The heart of hope which is never empty.
[1497.42 --> 1499.42]  All these gifts are ours.
[1499.42 --> 1507.42]  As God restores us to the fullness of life meant for us.
[1507.42 --> 1509.42]  Grounded in love.
[1509.42 --> 1511.42]  Rooted in discipleship.
[1511.42 --> 1517.42]  May we never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1517.42 --> 1523.42]  Because of his sacrifice, we offer ourselves in service to others.
[1523.42 --> 1528.42]  Recognizing the limitless grace which is ours to share in Christ.
[1528.42 --> 1530.42]  Thanks be to God.
[1530.42 --> 1532.42]  Amen.
[1532.42 --> 1534.42]  Amen.
[1534.42 --> 1536.42]  Amen.
[1536.42 --> 1538.42]  Amen.
[1538.42 --> 1540.42]  Amen.
[1540.42 --> 1542.42]  Amen.
[1542.42 --> 1544.42]  Amen.
[1544.42 --> 1546.42]  John.
[1546.42 --> 1548.42]  Amen.
[1548.42 --> 1552.42]  With listening the açбяет and through it.
[1552.42 --> 1557.50]  No peace, no path, no wisdom
[1557.50 --> 1563.50]  Come on with us, then Jesus Christ
[1564.30 --> 1568.50]  Is there the resurrection
[1568.50 --> 1575.50]  Why should I give from His reward?
[1575.50 --> 1580.50]  I cannot give an answer
[1580.50 --> 1587.00]  But who is I know with all my heart
[1587.00 --> 1591.96]  Is there to be my counsel
[1608.58 --> 1610.00]  Good morning, friends.
[1610.50 --> 1619.00]  I really do wish you could all be here to hear this beautiful music and to feel the vibrations,
[1619.00 --> 1620.96]  which you can't feel, of course, digitally.
[1620.96 --> 1622.62]  And I'm not trying to gloat.
[1623.84 --> 1625.78]  Just to say that it is beautiful.
[1625.78 --> 1655.78] 
[1655.78 --> 1658.16]  It's just a miracle that we will read momentarily.
[1658.16 --> 1664.28]  So Peter and John have performed a miracle healing a man who was lame from birth.
[1664.28 --> 1672.78]  And they proclaim that this miracle happened in the name of Jesus who had been resurrected from the dead.
[1672.78 --> 1678.28]  And so the religious leaders of the day are angry about this.
[1678.28 --> 1681.28]  And so they put Peter and John in prison
[1681.28 --> 1687.28]  And then the next day they meet and they command them to stop preaching in the name of Jesus.
[1687.78 --> 1689.60]  To stop preaching this gospel.
[1689.78 --> 1692.00]  To stop talking about Jesus.
[1692.00 --> 1694.50]  So of course, they refuse.
[1694.50 --> 1702.26]  They say, we cannot but speak about what we have seen and heard.
[1702.26 --> 1703.04]  Right?
[1703.04 --> 1709.94]  It's as if they were saying, look guys, if you've seen and witnessed what we have,
[1709.94 --> 1712.04]  You wouldn't listen to you either.
[1713.24 --> 1714.88]  And so Peter and John are released.
[1715.28 --> 1717.74]  They return to their friends, their church family.
[1718.24 --> 1720.14]  And so this is what happens next.
[1720.70 --> 1726.32]  And so we're reading today in Acts chapter 4, verses 23 to 31.
[1727.70 --> 1730.78]  So please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1732.66 --> 1736.82]  On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people
[1736.82 --> 1741.46]  And reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
[1742.18 --> 1746.12]  When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God.
[1747.12 --> 1749.00]  Sovereign Lord, they said,
[1749.68 --> 1753.98]  You made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
[1755.04 --> 1761.10]  You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David.
[1761.78 --> 1764.84]  Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
[1764.84 --> 1772.38]  The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one.
[1773.86 --> 1779.22]  Indeed, Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city
[1779.22 --> 1784.20]  To conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
[1784.84 --> 1789.54]  They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
[1789.54 --> 1797.70]  Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
[1798.66 --> 1804.76]  Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.
[1806.24 --> 1809.44]  After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken,
[1809.44 --> 1815.28]  And they were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
[1816.02 --> 1817.76]  Friends, this is the word of the Lord.
[1818.84 --> 1819.90]  Thanks be to God.
[1820.26 --> 1823.98]  Let's come before the Lord in prayer as these early Christians did.
[1824.32 --> 1824.74]  Let's pray.
[1824.74 --> 1836.26]  Father, we come before you as your children, seeking to hear a word from you.
[1836.94 --> 1842.74]  Seeking your words of truth and life because our souls are parched without them.
[1842.74 --> 1849.02]  And so, Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit, just as it was so active in the world,
[1849.92 --> 1852.92]  In the time that we are reading, and is so active even today,
[1853.54 --> 1857.96]  Would your Holy Spirit, Lord, teach us, empower us, and fill us,
[1858.36 --> 1860.28]  That we might become your faithful followers.
[1860.74 --> 1862.78]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1862.78 --> 1872.92]  So, have you ever made breakfast or dinner or a meal with a three-year-old?
[1875.10 --> 1877.46]  They're, you know, so excited to help cook.
[1878.12 --> 1880.34]  It's a big deal in their minds, right?
[1880.40 --> 1883.96]  And it makes them feel very important and grown up.
[1884.62 --> 1888.38]  You know, maybe they take a chair and they kind of scooch it over to the counter,
[1888.38 --> 1893.36]  And they get up and they help you stir whatever it is you're cooking for like eight seconds.
[1893.88 --> 1896.62]  And then they abandon you to go play.
[1897.82 --> 1900.60]  Only when you call, it's time for her to eat,
[1900.94 --> 1904.14]  They resurface and take all the credit.
[1905.72 --> 1909.20]  And, of course, a loving parent lets them have all the credit.
[1909.90 --> 1910.82]  So I've been told.
[1912.52 --> 1917.16]  I wonder if we do the same thing with God.
[1917.16 --> 1918.26]  Right?
[1918.34 --> 1924.90]  If we kind of magnify what we bring to the table.
[1926.10 --> 1928.44]  And as we move through the book of Acts,
[1928.50 --> 1932.10]  And as we've seen, and as we'll continue to see as we keep reading,
[1932.76 --> 1937.86]  That this book isn't about Peter and John.
[1938.52 --> 1939.68]  It's not about Paul.
[1940.62 --> 1943.68]  It's not about these early disciples and what they did,
[1944.00 --> 1946.40]  Or what they said, or anything else.
[1946.40 --> 1949.06]  This book is about the Holy Spirit.
[1949.92 --> 1951.12]  You know, it's about the Spirit.
[1951.98 --> 1953.20]  And what he has done.
[1953.32 --> 1954.56]  What he is doing.
[1954.92 --> 1957.56]  And what he continues to do even today.
[1958.66 --> 1960.90]  You know, and so, if you look in your Bibles,
[1961.08 --> 1962.24]  The title will say,
[1962.38 --> 1964.10]  The Acts of the Apostles.
[1965.08 --> 1968.48]  But it's the Acts of the Apostles through the Holy Spirit.
[1968.48 --> 1972.10]  As he works in them and works through them.
[1972.10 --> 1978.66]  And so everything we read here is directly an act of the Lord Jesus himself.
[1979.32 --> 1981.76]  Inviting us to join him.
[1981.84 --> 1983.24]  And empowering us.
[1983.88 --> 1985.58]  And transforming his people.
[1986.00 --> 1988.98]  And through them, changing the world.
[1989.72 --> 1990.88]  And saving the world.
[1990.88 --> 2000.60]  You know, and so, whether it's people suddenly being fluent in, you know, dozens of languages that they've never learned.
[2001.60 --> 2007.00]  Or sermons by untrained preachers that are able to pierce the hearts of thousands.
[2007.54 --> 2009.82]  Or the healing of a man born lame.
[2010.22 --> 2014.56]  Or facing a high priestly council with incredible boldness.
[2014.56 --> 2017.32]  And all of these things that they've done so far.
[2017.76 --> 2020.98]  What we see is that they don't take any credit for it.
[2021.98 --> 2028.76]  You know, for them, there is absolutely no question at all about who is moving and who is acting.
[2029.72 --> 2029.94]  Right?
[2030.00 --> 2035.38]  So they're just kind of watching in awe as the Holy Spirit goes to work.
[2035.66 --> 2037.80]  He's taking all that Jesus Christ did.
[2037.88 --> 2038.90]  His death and resurrection.
[2039.86 --> 2043.16]  And unfolding what that means.
[2043.16 --> 2045.96]  And setting it in motion in the world.
[2047.16 --> 2048.40]  And so how do we know that?
[2048.92 --> 2056.14]  Well, we look at what happens when Peter and John return now to their church family.
[2057.08 --> 2057.34]  Right?
[2057.94 --> 2060.24]  They've just performed this amazing miracle.
[2060.70 --> 2061.64]  Everyone's in awe.
[2062.28 --> 2064.82]  5,000 people, it says, were added to the church.
[2065.40 --> 2070.94]  They stand before the Sanhedrin in defiance and faithful disobedience.
[2071.24 --> 2072.42]  Talk their way out of jail.
[2073.16 --> 2079.86]  And then this all would be a fairly natural moment for them to start congratulating themselves.
[2080.20 --> 2081.94]  Just like a three-year-old chef.
[2082.84 --> 2084.32]  But that's not what they did.
[2085.30 --> 2086.22]  And so what do they do?
[2087.58 --> 2089.62]  It says they went back.
[2089.62 --> 2092.26]  They told their friends everything that had happened.
[2093.30 --> 2097.86]  But then it says they lifted their voices together to God.
[2098.90 --> 2099.12]  Right?
[2099.20 --> 2105.52]  Their first impulse is to acknowledge who really made breakfast.
[2105.52 --> 2109.56]  And so here's what I want us to see today.
[2110.48 --> 2110.96]  Right?
[2111.02 --> 2115.68]  That there is no confusion in the minds of the early Christians about whose acts that they are witnessing.
[2115.68 --> 2119.48]  Because look how ready they are to pray.
[2120.16 --> 2121.78]  They know they need help.
[2122.70 --> 2124.52]  And so they sprint to the Lord.
[2124.52 --> 2130.62]  Both in their joy and their excitement of all that God is doing in them and through them.
[2130.62 --> 2133.04]  But also in their need.
[2133.38 --> 2135.20]  Because they were just threatened.
[2136.46 --> 2139.40]  They're a bit shaken by what had happened.
[2139.40 --> 2144.94]  And so today I want us just to look at this prayer and see the pattern of it.
[2145.62 --> 2155.84]  And I think it's a pattern that we can learn as we seek to put prayer at the forefront of our lives individually and all that we do together as a church.
[2157.34 --> 2158.82]  And so here's the pattern.
[2159.36 --> 2161.78]  Their prayer begins with praise.
[2162.70 --> 2165.62]  And that praise leads them to petition.
[2166.62 --> 2167.76]  And then it results in power.
[2167.76 --> 2168.48]  Okay?
[2168.60 --> 2170.76]  So praise, petition, and power.
[2171.24 --> 2171.36]  All right?
[2171.40 --> 2172.36]  So let's look at this together.
[2173.72 --> 2174.16]  Okay?
[2174.20 --> 2175.16]  So first, praise.
[2175.26 --> 2177.28]  And they come to God together in prayer.
[2177.60 --> 2179.14]  And what's the first thing they pray?
[2179.42 --> 2180.98]  And it says in verse 24.
[2181.66 --> 2181.88]  It says,
[2181.88 --> 2185.96]  When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God and said,
[2186.94 --> 2188.72]  Sovereign Lord.
[2189.14 --> 2189.32]  Okay?
[2189.46 --> 2190.16]  Sovereign Lord.
[2191.24 --> 2193.12]  And so here's the fascinating thing.
[2193.46 --> 2197.74]  The word that Luke uses in the Greek is not the normal word that he uses.
[2197.76 --> 2199.42]  It's for Lord, which would be kurios.
[2199.86 --> 2201.24]  And would just mean like master.
[2202.14 --> 2209.28]  Instead, this is a word used of a ruler who holds absolute power.
[2209.60 --> 2211.26]  Who has no rivals.
[2211.26 --> 2222.66]  And so what I want us to see is that our view of God, who he is, his character, will affect the way we respond to him in prayer.
[2222.66 --> 2231.50]  And so probably many of us will know that the great man of God, J.I. Packer, recently went home to the Lord.
[2232.12 --> 2246.28]  But when he taught classes on theology at Regent College, he would begin each class by having the whole class stand and sing a rousing rendition of the doxology.
[2246.28 --> 2248.60]  Every single time.
[2249.38 --> 2255.82]  And the lesson he wanted his students to learn in doing that is that theology leads to doxology.
[2256.52 --> 2263.60]  That our knowledge of God and who he is impacts our devotional life, our life of praise, our life of prayer.
[2263.60 --> 2267.00]  So they begin with praise.
[2267.26 --> 2269.62]  And they reflect on God's sovereignty.
[2270.22 --> 2272.16]  And they do that in three different ways here.
[2273.22 --> 2273.38]  Okay.
[2273.74 --> 2282.38]  They say that God, he created, he made, he spoke, and then he decided.
[2282.62 --> 2285.60]  And so they're looking at God's sovereignty in these three different aspects.
[2286.36 --> 2289.52]  And so the first one is this, that he is the God of creation.
[2289.52 --> 2292.08]  So look what it says in verse 24.
[2293.24 --> 2298.82]  It says, you made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
[2299.90 --> 2309.12]  And so the early church now, in this moment of prayer, as the threat has kind of come against them to not speak in the name of Jesus.
[2309.12 --> 2317.26]  And so where the creation, right, people are fighting against their creator.
[2318.58 --> 2324.76]  And they're recognizing in this moment God's sovereignty over all of his creation.
[2325.42 --> 2329.90]  And they recognize that God's sovereign rule means that he is the creator of all things.
[2330.48 --> 2332.30]  All things are under his control.
[2333.66 --> 2337.54]  And I love what Karl Barth says about God as creator.
[2337.54 --> 2340.36]  He says this, quote,
[2341.08 --> 2346.86]  He creates, sustains, and rules the world as the theater of his glory.
[2347.56 --> 2347.74]  Okay.
[2347.76 --> 2352.14]  The whole world is the theater of God's glory.
[2354.62 --> 2355.96]  And this is important.
[2356.58 --> 2362.06]  Because when we face dark days, when we face challenges in life,
[2362.06 --> 2367.78]  or even when we see the news and we see, you know, everything that's happening with a pandemic,
[2367.96 --> 2373.52]  people dying, people getting sick, people facing economic hardship,
[2374.28 --> 2376.70]  we see police brutality and racism.
[2377.44 --> 2380.38]  All of these things that come up in our world,
[2380.88 --> 2384.86]  we must not lose sight that God is the creator of all.
[2385.50 --> 2388.76]  And one day, he will put all things to right.
[2388.76 --> 2394.38]  And I think the power of this prayer is that instead of being afraid,
[2395.34 --> 2399.24]  which is what they very reasonably could be feeling right now,
[2399.28 --> 2400.72]  and they probably are to some extent,
[2401.74 --> 2406.78]  you know, and fear even today is often kind of the mark of Christians.
[2407.76 --> 2412.42]  But they recognize God as sovereign Lord, as creator of the heavens and the earth.
[2412.42 --> 2415.42]  And that means that there's nothing outside of his control.
[2416.38 --> 2417.90]  And we need to remember that.
[2418.44 --> 2422.88]  Because it's that confidence we have in God's sovereign control
[2422.88 --> 2428.78]  that gives us the ability to face the darkness without hiding from it in fear.
[2430.54 --> 2430.78]  Okay.
[2430.80 --> 2432.66]  So God is the God of creation.
[2432.92 --> 2435.46]  Then he goes on in verses 25 and 26.
[2435.46 --> 2437.32]  And he says,
[2437.92 --> 2443.38]  You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David.
[2444.08 --> 2447.04]  Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
[2447.54 --> 2451.56]  The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord,
[2451.92 --> 2453.20]  against his anointed one.
[2454.72 --> 2454.96]  Okay.
[2455.02 --> 2457.46]  So here they're quoting Psalm 2.
[2457.68 --> 2458.70]  It's the first two verses.
[2459.54 --> 2461.72]  And this shows that the early church,
[2462.18 --> 2464.32]  even just by the middle of the first century,
[2464.32 --> 2467.88]  already read Psalm 2 as a messianic psalm
[2467.88 --> 2470.54]  that was fulfilled in the person of Jesus.
[2471.82 --> 2477.68]  So what are they saying about God as sovereign Lord in this prayer?
[2478.58 --> 2481.54]  They're saying that he is a God who not only created,
[2482.32 --> 2484.02]  but he is the God who speaks.
[2484.90 --> 2485.02]  Right?
[2485.06 --> 2487.50]  That he is a God of revelation.
[2488.52 --> 2488.64]  Right?
[2488.70 --> 2491.46]  God's sovereignty means that God has spoken.
[2491.46 --> 2497.20]  He has spoken who he is and his reality into our reality.
[2497.96 --> 2502.82]  And they're saying that you are a God who speaks the future into being.
[2503.94 --> 2507.34]  So friends, God has not left us to our own devices
[2507.34 --> 2510.32]  to try to figure out and determine who God is,
[2510.50 --> 2511.46]  what he is like.
[2511.80 --> 2515.18]  But God has actually chosen to reveal himself
[2515.18 --> 2518.88]  to us through the scriptures.
[2518.88 --> 2522.98]  And they already saw the connection
[2522.98 --> 2525.76]  that the way to know God intimately
[2525.76 --> 2527.70]  is by taking the scriptures,
[2527.86 --> 2531.32]  by taking them into our hearts and our minds,
[2532.00 --> 2533.74]  and then reflecting upon the fact
[2533.74 --> 2534.92]  that the written word
[2534.92 --> 2537.64]  is a pointer to Jesus Christ,
[2537.72 --> 2538.68]  who is the living word.
[2539.96 --> 2542.04]  And you can't know God
[2542.04 --> 2545.78]  if you don't spend time with him.
[2546.40 --> 2546.90]  Right?
[2546.90 --> 2548.42]  We know that.
[2548.88 --> 2550.94]  And you can't spend time with him
[2550.94 --> 2554.26]  if we refuse to ever open up the Bible.
[2555.38 --> 2557.74]  And so we must be people of the word.
[2558.52 --> 2560.58]  And notice that their prayer life and their praise
[2560.58 --> 2562.16]  begins with scripture.
[2562.78 --> 2563.26]  That they,
[2563.64 --> 2564.36]  excuse me,
[2564.40 --> 2567.80]  they have the word of God in their hearts.
[2567.88 --> 2569.18]  They're able to quote it
[2569.18 --> 2570.48]  in their prayer.
[2571.30 --> 2572.64]  And so one takeaway for us
[2572.64 --> 2575.60]  is that if you don't know what to pray,
[2576.46 --> 2578.12]  the best place to start
[2578.12 --> 2579.60]  is with the scriptures.
[2580.06 --> 2582.08]  So we can go to the Psalms,
[2582.64 --> 2585.64]  we can go to the letters of Paul,
[2586.20 --> 2588.16]  and we can pray the scriptures.
[2588.38 --> 2589.86]  We can pray those words
[2589.86 --> 2593.06]  by which God has taught us
[2593.06 --> 2594.10]  how to relate to him.
[2594.20 --> 2596.42]  Because everything he reveals about himself
[2596.42 --> 2597.18]  in the Bible
[2597.18 --> 2599.54]  is for us to know him
[2599.54 --> 2600.66]  and to relate to him.
[2601.90 --> 2603.70]  Okay, so he is the God of creation.
[2603.86 --> 2605.46]  He is the God of revelation.
[2605.64 --> 2606.86]  He reveals himself.
[2608.08 --> 2609.32]  And then look what it says next
[2609.32 --> 2610.34]  in verse 27.
[2611.34 --> 2611.58]  It says,
[2611.58 --> 2612.06]  Indeed,
[2612.82 --> 2614.10]  Herod and Pontius Pilate
[2614.10 --> 2615.70]  met together with the Gentiles
[2615.70 --> 2616.70]  and the people of Israel
[2616.70 --> 2617.54]  in this city
[2617.54 --> 2620.28]  to conspire against your holy servant Jesus,
[2620.90 --> 2621.72]  whom you appointed.
[2622.82 --> 2623.46]  Okay, so notice
[2623.46 --> 2625.62]  they begin to specifically point out
[2625.62 --> 2626.64]  Herod,
[2627.32 --> 2628.40]  Pontius Pilate,
[2629.00 --> 2630.78]  and how that they had met together
[2630.78 --> 2632.36]  to conspire against Jesus.
[2632.48 --> 2633.54]  This had just happened
[2633.54 --> 2634.90]  several weeks before.
[2635.72 --> 2636.98]  So the early church,
[2637.66 --> 2638.68]  in its prayer,
[2639.40 --> 2640.52]  recognized Psalm 2
[2640.52 --> 2641.80]  as being fulfilled
[2641.80 --> 2643.62]  before their very eyes.
[2643.98 --> 2646.00]  And as that high priestly court
[2646.00 --> 2646.86]  got together
[2646.86 --> 2648.08]  and told them
[2648.08 --> 2649.50]  not to preach against Jesus,
[2649.68 --> 2650.70]  they are fulfilling
[2650.70 --> 2653.44]  what Psalm 2 had said.
[2654.38 --> 2655.90]  That the threats of these rulers
[2655.90 --> 2656.74]  against preaching
[2656.74 --> 2657.76]  the name of Jesus
[2657.76 --> 2659.60]  was in direct accordance
[2659.60 --> 2661.30]  with what the scriptures
[2661.30 --> 2663.02]  foretold would happen.
[2664.14 --> 2664.98]  And they say,
[2665.68 --> 2665.98]  Lord,
[2666.12 --> 2667.10]  you are sovereign
[2667.10 --> 2668.52]  over this as well.
[2668.52 --> 2670.24]  You are God
[2670.24 --> 2671.70]  who is absolutely sovereign
[2671.70 --> 2674.00]  over every single event
[2674.00 --> 2675.68]  over the course of human history.
[2676.20 --> 2676.80]  Not only are you
[2676.80 --> 2678.10]  the God of all creation,
[2678.52 --> 2679.50]  the heavens and the earth,
[2680.06 --> 2681.26]  the God of revelation,
[2681.52 --> 2682.74]  but every single thing
[2682.74 --> 2683.48]  that happens,
[2684.18 --> 2686.28]  you have complete control over.
[2687.44 --> 2688.54]  And they continue
[2688.54 --> 2689.74]  in verse 28,
[2689.86 --> 2690.38]  and they said,
[2690.38 --> 2691.62]  they did
[2691.62 --> 2693.50]  what your power
[2693.50 --> 2694.10]  and will
[2694.10 --> 2695.04]  had decided
[2695.04 --> 2696.22]  beforehand
[2696.22 --> 2697.00]  should happen.
[2698.82 --> 2699.88]  And so what are they
[2699.88 --> 2700.80]  talking about here?
[2701.42 --> 2702.60]  They're talking about
[2702.60 --> 2703.90]  the crucifixion of Jesus.
[2705.26 --> 2705.90]  And so friends,
[2706.48 --> 2707.32]  this is kind of
[2707.32 --> 2708.32]  hard for us
[2708.32 --> 2709.80]  to truly grasp,
[2710.14 --> 2710.82]  but basically
[2710.82 --> 2711.86]  they're saying that
[2711.86 --> 2712.96]  God,
[2713.04 --> 2714.04]  you took the very
[2714.04 --> 2715.20]  worst thing
[2715.20 --> 2716.30]  imaginable,
[2716.58 --> 2717.80]  that the human race
[2717.80 --> 2718.68]  would rebel
[2718.68 --> 2719.52]  against God,
[2719.86 --> 2720.82]  take your son,
[2722.50 --> 2723.38]  crucify him
[2723.38 --> 2724.28]  on a cross,
[2724.58 --> 2725.22]  kill the very
[2725.22 --> 2725.94]  son of God,
[2726.50 --> 2727.04]  that you took
[2727.04 --> 2727.92]  this very worst
[2727.92 --> 2728.64]  human deed
[2728.64 --> 2730.18]  and you turned it
[2730.18 --> 2730.96]  on its head
[2730.96 --> 2732.30]  and you made it
[2732.30 --> 2733.62]  the means of salvation,
[2734.44 --> 2734.62]  right,
[2734.68 --> 2735.36]  of everyone
[2735.36 --> 2736.16]  who would turn
[2736.16 --> 2737.00]  to you in faith,
[2737.46 --> 2738.68]  that you are
[2738.68 --> 2739.64]  the sovereign God
[2739.64 --> 2740.56]  who even takes
[2740.56 --> 2741.90]  these events
[2741.90 --> 2742.76]  that look
[2742.76 --> 2743.90]  so terrible
[2743.90 --> 2745.14]  and use them
[2745.14 --> 2746.56]  for your purposes.
[2748.16 --> 2749.70]  So they come
[2749.70 --> 2750.60]  together in prayer
[2750.60 --> 2752.14]  and their first
[2752.14 --> 2753.08]  step is to just
[2753.08 --> 2754.44]  clarify their vision,
[2754.86 --> 2755.88]  to remind themselves
[2755.88 --> 2757.58]  who is in charge,
[2758.20 --> 2759.04]  that God is
[2759.04 --> 2759.84]  the sovereign Lord,
[2760.44 --> 2762.32]  that he is in charge.
[2762.88 --> 2763.66]  So they begin
[2763.66 --> 2764.20]  with praise
[2764.20 --> 2764.58]  and they say,
[2764.72 --> 2765.28]  you are the God
[2765.28 --> 2765.82]  of creation,
[2766.00 --> 2766.58]  you are the God
[2766.58 --> 2767.18]  of revelation,
[2767.40 --> 2767.92]  you are the God
[2767.92 --> 2768.42]  of history,
[2768.78 --> 2769.76]  that this history
[2769.76 --> 2771.54]  is your history,
[2772.10 --> 2773.46]  that we are a part
[2773.46 --> 2774.44]  of it and we just
[2774.44 --> 2775.68]  surrender to you,
[2776.00 --> 2777.28]  we submit to you.
[2780.00 --> 2780.76]  And so now
[2780.76 --> 2781.42]  the next part
[2781.42 --> 2782.12]  of their prayer
[2782.12 --> 2783.30]  is that they move
[2783.30 --> 2783.94]  into petition,
[2784.40 --> 2785.46]  but notice it's only
[2785.46 --> 2788.06]  after they praise God
[2788.06 --> 2789.04]  that they finally
[2789.04 --> 2789.90]  get to their request,
[2790.00 --> 2790.60]  they don't just come
[2790.60 --> 2791.80]  to God with their requests,
[2792.32 --> 2793.70]  they remind themselves
[2793.70 --> 2794.56]  of who God is.
[2795.44 --> 2796.74]  So after praising God
[2796.74 --> 2797.48]  for his sovereignty,
[2798.32 --> 2800.10]  they finally come
[2800.10 --> 2801.70]  to see what really
[2801.70 --> 2802.72]  is often the hardest
[2802.72 --> 2803.94]  thing for us to see
[2803.94 --> 2805.56]  in our circumstances,
[2805.56 --> 2807.78]  that God is present
[2807.78 --> 2809.64]  and that he is in charge
[2809.64 --> 2811.08]  even in our present
[2811.08 --> 2811.52]  suffering.
[2812.98 --> 2814.30]  And so they're ready
[2814.30 --> 2815.56]  to seek God's help.
[2816.50 --> 2817.86]  And they have these
[2817.86 --> 2819.54]  kind of three main requests.
[2820.08 --> 2820.56]  And what I think
[2820.56 --> 2821.46]  is so fascinating
[2821.46 --> 2822.72]  is I think that
[2822.72 --> 2823.76]  their requests
[2823.76 --> 2825.88]  are in response
[2825.88 --> 2826.88]  to what they already
[2826.88 --> 2827.86]  said about who God
[2827.86 --> 2828.88]  is and his sovereignty.
[2828.88 --> 2830.28]  And so they're kind
[2830.28 --> 2831.02]  of mirroring
[2831.02 --> 2831.84]  or responding
[2831.84 --> 2832.92]  to who God is.
[2833.22 --> 2833.84]  And so let's take
[2833.84 --> 2834.52]  a look at that.
[2835.16 --> 2836.54]  So the first petition
[2836.54 --> 2837.66]  is in verse 29.
[2837.80 --> 2838.28]  They say,
[2838.72 --> 2839.20]  now Lord,
[2839.74 --> 2841.12]  consider their threats.
[2842.18 --> 2842.42]  Right?
[2842.46 --> 2843.80]  And this kind of reflects
[2843.80 --> 2844.60]  God's sovereignty
[2844.60 --> 2845.60]  over all things,
[2845.72 --> 2846.32]  over the heavens
[2846.32 --> 2846.94]  and the earth.
[2847.62 --> 2848.22]  They're saying,
[2848.32 --> 2848.44]  Lord,
[2848.52 --> 2849.64]  everything is under
[2849.64 --> 2850.80]  your control.
[2851.42 --> 2851.76]  So Lord,
[2851.80 --> 2852.92]  we take this threat
[2852.92 --> 2853.76]  that has come upon us
[2853.76 --> 2854.70]  and we give it
[2854.70 --> 2855.68]  into your hands.
[2856.18 --> 2857.44]  Would you consider
[2857.44 --> 2859.22]  this challenge
[2859.22 --> 2860.04]  that we're facing?
[2860.58 --> 2860.78]  Lord,
[2860.86 --> 2862.10]  be sovereign over it.
[2863.54 --> 2864.36]  And I think
[2864.36 --> 2865.38]  what's kind of
[2865.38 --> 2866.26]  just as interesting
[2866.26 --> 2868.38]  is what they don't pray
[2868.38 --> 2870.04]  as what they do pray.
[2870.20 --> 2871.00]  Because you'll notice
[2871.00 --> 2871.84]  what they don't say.
[2872.44 --> 2873.28]  They don't say,
[2874.06 --> 2874.26]  Lord,
[2874.38 --> 2875.24]  you are sovereign,
[2875.66 --> 2876.22]  so therefore,
[2877.08 --> 2877.26]  Lord,
[2877.34 --> 2878.16]  come and change
[2878.16 --> 2879.04]  our circumstances.
[2879.84 --> 2880.00]  Right?
[2880.42 --> 2880.74]  Therefore,
[2880.88 --> 2882.06]  come and just take away
[2882.06 --> 2883.06]  all of these problems.
[2884.18 --> 2884.36]  You know,
[2884.38 --> 2885.06]  that's the first
[2885.06 --> 2886.40]  response that I have
[2886.40 --> 2886.84]  when I'm faced
[2886.84 --> 2887.52]  with difficulty
[2887.52 --> 2888.64]  or suffering
[2888.64 --> 2889.68]  or if, you know,
[2889.72 --> 2890.92]  a person is really
[2890.92 --> 2891.60]  bugging me.
[2892.24 --> 2892.74]  I pray,
[2893.70 --> 2893.96]  Lord,
[2894.10 --> 2895.48]  just make this stop.
[2896.42 --> 2896.68]  Like,
[2896.74 --> 2897.26]  would you just make
[2897.26 --> 2897.92]  this go away?
[2897.98 --> 2898.92]  Would you judge them?
[2900.24 --> 2901.08]  But this is not
[2901.08 --> 2901.90]  what they prayed for.
[2902.64 --> 2902.86]  Right?
[2902.90 --> 2903.72]  They didn't just pray,
[2903.84 --> 2904.00]  Lord,
[2904.12 --> 2905.52]  give us peace and safety.
[2906.00 --> 2906.56]  They didn't say,
[2906.64 --> 2906.76]  Lord,
[2906.84 --> 2907.60]  judge our enemies.
[2909.08 --> 2909.80]  They're saying,
[2909.80 --> 2911.58]  if God is sovereign,
[2912.30 --> 2913.38]  then we can trust
[2913.38 --> 2914.06]  his ways.
[2914.18 --> 2914.76]  We can trust
[2914.76 --> 2915.34]  what's happening.
[2916.38 --> 2917.52]  And their trust
[2917.52 --> 2918.34]  is completely
[2918.34 --> 2919.34]  transferred over
[2919.34 --> 2920.10]  to Jesus.
[2922.04 --> 2922.28]  You know,
[2922.36 --> 2923.96]  and Jesus didn't say
[2923.96 --> 2925.04]  that he would keep us
[2925.04 --> 2925.96]  from all possibility
[2925.96 --> 2926.46]  of suffering.
[2926.82 --> 2927.56]  He didn't say
[2927.56 --> 2928.38]  that he would keep us
[2928.38 --> 2929.08]  from persecution.
[2929.98 --> 2930.42]  In fact,
[2930.50 --> 2931.22]  Jesus said,
[2932.16 --> 2932.94]  in this world,
[2933.30 --> 2934.40]  you will have trouble,
[2934.92 --> 2935.84]  but be of good cheer.
[2935.92 --> 2936.64]  I have overcome
[2936.64 --> 2937.28]  the world.
[2938.22 --> 2938.42]  Right?
[2938.42 --> 2938.70]  And so,
[2938.88 --> 2939.54]  we have that
[2939.54 --> 2940.70]  perfect balance there
[2940.70 --> 2942.44]  that there are realities
[2942.44 --> 2944.38]  that are against God
[2944.38 --> 2945.78]  and against his people
[2945.78 --> 2946.68]  that are at work
[2946.68 --> 2947.26]  in the world,
[2947.78 --> 2948.80]  but Jesus says,
[2949.00 --> 2949.36]  don't worry.
[2949.90 --> 2950.72]  I have overcome
[2950.72 --> 2951.34]  the world.
[2952.08 --> 2953.02]  I am sovereign.
[2953.88 --> 2954.74]  And he says to us,
[2954.84 --> 2955.98]  I am keeping you
[2955.98 --> 2957.40]  in the midst
[2957.40 --> 2959.40]  of all of the ugliness
[2959.40 --> 2960.16]  of the world
[2960.16 --> 2961.40]  so that you would be
[2961.40 --> 2962.18]  conduits
[2962.18 --> 2963.44]  of my grace
[2963.44 --> 2964.92]  and my rescue mission.
[2964.92 --> 2968.10]  So then,
[2968.18 --> 2969.10]  their second petition
[2969.10 --> 2969.72]  is this.
[2969.86 --> 2970.14]  They say,
[2970.40 --> 2971.44]  enable your servants
[2971.44 --> 2972.78]  to speak your word
[2972.78 --> 2974.14]  with great boldness.
[2974.50 --> 2974.66]  Right?
[2974.74 --> 2976.24]  Not keep us safe,
[2976.40 --> 2976.92]  not, you know,
[2977.00 --> 2978.02]  change our circumstances,
[2978.28 --> 2979.14]  or make us bold.
[2980.76 --> 2981.76]  Because, remember,
[2981.96 --> 2983.22]  God is the God
[2983.22 --> 2983.86]  of revelation,
[2984.48 --> 2985.78]  the God who speaks.
[2986.52 --> 2987.40]  So they say,
[2988.00 --> 2988.24]  Lord,
[2988.38 --> 2989.24]  give us boldness
[2989.24 --> 2990.02]  to speak.
[2990.38 --> 2991.10]  You are the God
[2991.10 --> 2992.26]  who speaks.
[2992.58 --> 2993.76]  Make us ones
[2993.76 --> 2995.62]  who speak your word also.
[2996.56 --> 2996.78]  Lord,
[2996.84 --> 2998.18]  let us kind of proclaim
[2998.18 --> 2999.44]  who you are
[2999.44 --> 3000.92]  in your revelation
[3000.92 --> 3001.50]  in the world.
[3003.34 --> 3003.56]  Right?
[3003.64 --> 3004.26]  So God
[3004.26 --> 3007.40]  is sovereign
[3007.40 --> 3008.26]  over salvation.
[3009.96 --> 3010.72]  And so,
[3011.12 --> 3012.10]  Jesus alone
[3012.10 --> 3012.66]  is the one
[3012.66 --> 3013.30]  who saves.
[3014.52 --> 3015.38]  But the way
[3015.38 --> 3016.86]  he accomplishes that
[3016.86 --> 3017.70]  is through us,
[3017.72 --> 3017.94]  right?
[3019.26 --> 3019.54]  You know,
[3019.64 --> 3020.66]  and Paul says later,
[3020.82 --> 3021.94]  how can they be saved
[3021.94 --> 3022.80]  if they don't hear?
[3022.80 --> 3024.36]  And how will they hear
[3024.36 --> 3025.52]  if no one speaks?
[3026.86 --> 3027.80]  And so they say,
[3027.88 --> 3029.00]  they pray for boldness.
[3029.16 --> 3029.30]  Well,
[3029.42 --> 3030.44]  would we speak?
[3031.00 --> 3031.18]  You know,
[3031.22 --> 3032.06]  and all of us
[3032.06 --> 3033.02]  can speak.
[3033.12 --> 3033.72]  Not all of us
[3033.72 --> 3034.72]  are maybe gifted
[3034.72 --> 3036.20]  with the spiritual gift
[3036.20 --> 3037.06]  of evangelism,
[3037.48 --> 3039.18]  but we've all experienced
[3039.18 --> 3040.70]  the trauma of grace
[3040.70 --> 3041.48]  that has come upon
[3041.48 --> 3042.08]  our lives.
[3042.88 --> 3044.00]  We can all kind of,
[3044.04 --> 3044.20]  you know,
[3044.24 --> 3044.96]  read our Bible
[3044.96 --> 3045.70]  and just say,
[3045.84 --> 3045.94]  oh,
[3045.98 --> 3046.62]  this is what God
[3046.62 --> 3047.42]  is speaking to me.
[3047.48 --> 3048.66]  We can speak his word.
[3049.06 --> 3049.80]  We can share it
[3049.80 --> 3050.24]  with people.
[3050.24 --> 3052.68]  And so that's
[3052.68 --> 3053.46]  what they ask.
[3054.92 --> 3055.30]  Lord,
[3055.46 --> 3056.56]  so they give
[3056.56 --> 3057.56]  the threats to God.
[3058.18 --> 3058.68]  They say,
[3058.80 --> 3059.52]  all we ask is
[3059.52 --> 3060.26]  that you would make us
[3060.26 --> 3062.30]  bold to make you known
[3062.30 --> 3063.28]  in the midst
[3063.28 --> 3065.04]  of these circumstances
[3065.04 --> 3065.94]  and these threats.
[3067.30 --> 3068.42]  And then the third petition
[3068.42 --> 3069.08]  is,
[3069.16 --> 3069.44]  they say,
[3069.52 --> 3070.74]  stretch out your hand
[3070.74 --> 3071.46]  to heal
[3071.46 --> 3072.72]  and perform
[3072.72 --> 3073.72]  signs and wonders
[3073.72 --> 3074.42]  through the name
[3074.42 --> 3075.40]  of your holy servant,
[3075.52 --> 3075.74]  Jesus.
[3075.74 --> 3078.30]  And remember,
[3078.44 --> 3078.62]  friends,
[3078.74 --> 3079.60]  God is the God
[3079.60 --> 3080.12]  of history.
[3080.90 --> 3081.04]  Right?
[3081.30 --> 3082.58]  So they pray,
[3082.90 --> 3083.26]  Lord,
[3083.70 --> 3084.90]  would you continue
[3084.90 --> 3086.02]  to act
[3086.02 --> 3087.80]  among us today?
[3088.30 --> 3089.86]  Would you come
[3089.86 --> 3090.86]  and stretch out
[3090.86 --> 3091.52]  your hand
[3091.52 --> 3092.20]  and heal?
[3093.20 --> 3094.22]  Use us to heal
[3094.22 --> 3095.58]  whoever comes our way.
[3096.16 --> 3097.60]  And may that be
[3097.60 --> 3098.54]  a sign
[3098.54 --> 3100.54]  of the wonder
[3100.54 --> 3101.90]  of Jesus Christ himself.
[3102.96 --> 3103.22]  Lord,
[3103.30 --> 3104.70]  continue to move
[3104.70 --> 3105.90]  in our lives.
[3105.96 --> 3106.52]  You are the God
[3106.52 --> 3107.06]  of history,
[3107.14 --> 3108.02]  of all events.
[3109.48 --> 3109.68]  Right?
[3109.74 --> 3110.44]  And so they begin
[3110.44 --> 3111.32]  with praise,
[3111.46 --> 3112.44]  reflecting on the sovereignty
[3112.44 --> 3113.00]  of God.
[3113.58 --> 3114.22]  Then they're moved
[3114.22 --> 3114.94]  to petition
[3114.94 --> 3116.12]  where in light
[3116.12 --> 3117.00]  of who God is,
[3117.08 --> 3117.90]  they ask
[3117.90 --> 3119.66]  that they would be
[3119.66 --> 3120.62]  used by God
[3120.62 --> 3121.42]  for his mission.
[3123.50 --> 3124.64]  And so let's pause
[3124.64 --> 3125.52]  to think about that.
[3126.58 --> 3127.20]  Let's think about
[3127.20 --> 3127.86]  this prayer
[3127.86 --> 3129.96]  and the pattern
[3129.96 --> 3130.60]  of this prayer.
[3130.88 --> 3131.46]  And so just,
[3131.64 --> 3132.64]  here's a couple questions
[3132.64 --> 3135.04]  that I want us
[3135.04 --> 3136.08]  to reflect on
[3136.08 --> 3136.54]  this morning.
[3137.58 --> 3139.26]  What would it look like
[3139.26 --> 3139.96]  if Christians
[3139.96 --> 3140.90]  prayed like this?
[3142.54 --> 3143.82]  What would it look like
[3143.82 --> 3144.86]  if you started
[3144.86 --> 3145.80]  to pray like this?
[3147.08 --> 3147.32]  Right?
[3147.38 --> 3148.16]  What would change
[3148.16 --> 3148.96]  in your life?
[3150.62 --> 3151.72]  What would change
[3151.72 --> 3152.86]  in our church
[3152.86 --> 3154.74]  if we enlarged
[3154.74 --> 3155.98]  our vision of God,
[3156.30 --> 3157.04]  his sovereignty
[3157.04 --> 3158.16]  over all things?
[3158.90 --> 3159.64]  And therefore,
[3159.64 --> 3160.74]  that we would bring
[3160.74 --> 3161.60]  even bigger
[3161.60 --> 3163.20]  requests to God
[3163.20 --> 3163.70]  in prayer.
[3165.90 --> 3167.38]  That's what I want us
[3167.38 --> 3168.14]  to think about
[3168.14 --> 3169.22]  in light of
[3169.22 --> 3170.22]  maybe what God
[3170.22 --> 3170.82]  is saying to us
[3170.82 --> 3171.36]  in this passage.
[3172.72 --> 3173.68]  So lastly,
[3174.32 --> 3175.20]  let's look at how
[3175.20 --> 3176.44]  God answered their prayer.
[3176.98 --> 3177.94]  And the simple answer
[3177.94 --> 3179.30]  is that they received
[3179.30 --> 3179.88]  the Holy Spirit.
[3180.60 --> 3181.80]  So look at verse 31.
[3182.46 --> 3183.48]  After they prayed,
[3183.60 --> 3184.38]  the place where they
[3184.38 --> 3184.86]  were meeting
[3184.86 --> 3185.46]  was shaken.
[3185.92 --> 3186.70]  They were all filled
[3186.70 --> 3187.56]  with the Holy Spirit.
[3187.56 --> 3188.50]  and they spoke
[3188.50 --> 3189.84]  the word of God boldly.
[3191.68 --> 3192.56]  So these Christians,
[3192.70 --> 3193.54]  they come in prayer.
[3193.70 --> 3194.70]  They ask for boldness
[3194.70 --> 3195.84]  to witness to Christ.
[3196.56 --> 3197.66]  And then what does God do?
[3198.04 --> 3199.76]  God doesn't exactly
[3199.76 --> 3201.68]  give them
[3201.68 --> 3203.08]  just what they ask for.
[3203.66 --> 3204.74]  God gives them
[3204.74 --> 3206.12]  way more,
[3206.42 --> 3207.36]  way beyond
[3207.36 --> 3208.36]  what they could even
[3208.36 --> 3209.60]  think to ask for.
[3210.00 --> 3211.48]  He gives them himself.
[3212.22 --> 3212.36]  Right?
[3212.40 --> 3213.02]  He gives them
[3213.02 --> 3213.90]  his presence,
[3214.26 --> 3214.94]  the spirit
[3214.94 --> 3216.16]  of the sovereign Lord,
[3216.16 --> 3216.64]  the spirit
[3216.64 --> 3217.60]  who is there
[3217.60 --> 3218.20]  at creation,
[3218.60 --> 3219.08]  the spirit
[3219.08 --> 3220.98]  who inspired
[3220.98 --> 3221.70]  the words
[3221.70 --> 3222.52]  of scripture,
[3223.98 --> 3224.48]  the spirit
[3224.48 --> 3225.76]  who is at work
[3225.76 --> 3226.78]  in the lives
[3226.78 --> 3227.54]  of his disciples
[3227.54 --> 3229.28]  in history.
[3229.70 --> 3230.34]  This spirit
[3230.34 --> 3231.32]  comes and
[3231.32 --> 3232.10]  he is present
[3232.10 --> 3232.66]  with them.
[3234.02 --> 3234.58]  And so friends,
[3234.66 --> 3235.18]  there is no
[3235.18 --> 3236.22]  powerful presence
[3236.22 --> 3236.78]  of Jesus
[3236.78 --> 3238.30]  in our own lives
[3238.30 --> 3239.26]  and in our church
[3239.26 --> 3239.80]  apart
[3239.80 --> 3241.66]  from going to God
[3241.66 --> 3242.52]  in prayerful
[3242.52 --> 3243.54]  dependence on him.
[3243.54 --> 3245.96]  And so the place
[3245.96 --> 3246.52]  is shaken.
[3247.44 --> 3248.16]  God's presence
[3248.16 --> 3248.64]  was there
[3248.64 --> 3249.86]  just like at Pentecost.
[3250.40 --> 3251.16]  And it says
[3251.16 --> 3251.74]  they were all
[3251.74 --> 3253.20]  filled with the Holy Spirit.
[3253.72 --> 3254.10]  So again,
[3254.18 --> 3254.36]  friends,
[3254.42 --> 3255.10]  this is not
[3255.10 --> 3256.68]  baptism of the Holy Spirit
[3256.68 --> 3257.32]  which happens
[3257.32 --> 3258.02]  one time
[3258.02 --> 3259.10]  in the believer's life.
[3259.48 --> 3260.72]  It's called regeneration
[3260.72 --> 3261.76]  where we become
[3261.76 --> 3263.30]  alive to Christ
[3263.30 --> 3263.96]  when we were dead
[3263.96 --> 3264.44]  in sin.
[3264.96 --> 3265.72]  But this is
[3265.72 --> 3266.88]  after having received
[3266.88 --> 3267.42]  the spirit,
[3267.92 --> 3268.38]  they are just
[3268.38 --> 3269.44]  filled with the spirit.
[3269.56 --> 3270.06]  They are filled
[3270.06 --> 3270.78]  afresh.
[3270.78 --> 3272.76]  And what it is
[3272.76 --> 3273.50]  is the Holy Spirit
[3273.50 --> 3274.68]  having more and more
[3274.68 --> 3275.56]  control
[3275.56 --> 3277.16]  over our lives.
[3278.30 --> 3279.18]  And so these Christians,
[3279.42 --> 3280.18]  notice what they're doing.
[3280.28 --> 3280.96]  They're just taking
[3280.96 --> 3281.60]  their hands
[3281.60 --> 3283.14]  off of their own lives.
[3283.68 --> 3284.52]  And they're putting
[3284.52 --> 3285.78]  everything on the table.
[3286.86 --> 3288.24]  They're suddenly realizing
[3288.24 --> 3289.08]  all of these people
[3289.08 --> 3289.76]  who are now
[3289.76 --> 3290.74]  coming to faith,
[3290.82 --> 3291.84]  they're suddenly realizing
[3291.84 --> 3294.48]  following Jesus
[3294.48 --> 3296.08]  isn't necessarily
[3296.08 --> 3296.94]  going to be easy.
[3297.90 --> 3299.12]  Are they in?
[3299.12 --> 3300.98]  they have to give up
[3300.98 --> 3301.50]  their comfort,
[3302.22 --> 3303.16]  they have to give up
[3303.16 --> 3303.82]  their safety,
[3304.34 --> 3305.14]  their reputation,
[3305.28 --> 3305.88]  they have to give up
[3305.88 --> 3306.26]  everything.
[3307.30 --> 3308.16]  And they say,
[3308.30 --> 3309.14]  if we're going to
[3309.14 --> 3309.86]  follow Jesus,
[3310.00 --> 3311.16]  he has to be everything.
[3312.04 --> 3313.02]  And it goes back
[3313.02 --> 3314.10]  to that initial statement,
[3314.36 --> 3315.20]  sovereign Lord.
[3316.64 --> 3317.20]  And so notice
[3317.20 --> 3317.88]  the outcome.
[3318.40 --> 3319.08]  It says,
[3319.60 --> 3320.30]  and they spoke
[3320.30 --> 3321.20]  the word of God
[3321.20 --> 3321.80]  boldly.
[3323.14 --> 3323.58]  Right?
[3323.72 --> 3324.38]  And so friends,
[3324.50 --> 3325.20]  prayer is to move
[3325.20 --> 3325.90]  us to action.
[3326.92 --> 3327.96]  Sometimes we think,
[3328.06 --> 3328.26]  you know,
[3328.26 --> 3328.98]  if we pray,
[3329.12 --> 3330.92]  we've done our work,
[3331.34 --> 3332.66]  maybe God will use work
[3332.66 --> 3334.04]  and maybe it doesn't
[3334.04 --> 3334.72]  have to be us.
[3335.62 --> 3336.40]  But prayer
[3336.40 --> 3337.96]  moves us to action.
[3338.90 --> 3339.14]  God,
[3339.32 --> 3339.66]  you know,
[3339.74 --> 3340.62]  he saved us,
[3340.68 --> 3341.26]  not just so that
[3341.26 --> 3342.04]  we would go to heaven,
[3343.16 --> 3343.94]  but that so
[3343.94 --> 3345.16]  that we would be
[3345.16 --> 3346.84]  conduits of his grace
[3346.84 --> 3348.42]  in the world
[3348.42 --> 3349.70]  as we live for him.
[3351.38 --> 3351.70]  And so,
[3351.84 --> 3352.24]  kind of,
[3352.94 --> 3354.46]  do you and I,
[3354.54 --> 3355.04]  do we know
[3355.04 --> 3355.72]  what that's like?
[3356.72 --> 3356.84]  Right?
[3356.84 --> 3358.72]  Has our life
[3358.72 --> 3360.42]  been radically
[3360.42 --> 3362.08]  reprioritized
[3362.08 --> 3362.48]  because
[3362.48 --> 3364.44]  of who Jesus is
[3364.44 --> 3364.94]  in the gospel
[3364.94 --> 3365.42]  of grace?
[3366.02 --> 3366.12]  Right?
[3366.16 --> 3366.72]  Has our life
[3366.72 --> 3367.68]  been shaken up
[3367.68 --> 3368.62]  and kind of shaken
[3368.62 --> 3369.26]  free
[3369.26 --> 3370.50]  of all these
[3370.50 --> 3371.04]  other things
[3371.04 --> 3371.46]  that we could
[3371.46 --> 3372.24]  put our trust in?
[3373.44 --> 3374.40]  Have you placed
[3374.40 --> 3375.18]  your life
[3375.18 --> 3376.96]  and your circumstances
[3376.96 --> 3378.94]  in God's
[3378.94 --> 3379.64]  sovereign hands?
[3380.30 --> 3381.00]  And have you
[3381.00 --> 3381.62]  found yourself
[3381.62 --> 3382.64]  truly alive
[3382.64 --> 3383.38]  in the love
[3383.38 --> 3383.90]  of God
[3383.90 --> 3384.56]  that is
[3384.56 --> 3385.46]  ours
[3385.46 --> 3386.40]  in Jesus Christ?
[3386.48 --> 3386.96]  A love
[3386.96 --> 3387.88]  that has come
[3387.88 --> 3388.24]  to us
[3388.24 --> 3388.64]  and a love
[3388.64 --> 3389.58]  that compels us
[3389.58 --> 3390.46]  to go out
[3390.46 --> 3390.84]  in mission.
[3391.70 --> 3392.26]  So let me
[3392.26 --> 3393.20]  pray for us
[3393.20 --> 3393.74]  that God
[3393.74 --> 3394.38]  would help us.
[3397.84 --> 3398.28]  Lord,
[3398.36 --> 3399.04]  make us people
[3399.04 --> 3399.50]  of prayer.
[3401.02 --> 3401.48]  Lord,
[3401.56 --> 3402.28]  we know
[3402.28 --> 3402.90]  as we look
[3402.90 --> 3403.62]  at your word
[3403.62 --> 3404.26]  and acts
[3404.26 --> 3404.64]  that,
[3405.40 --> 3405.50]  Lord,
[3405.64 --> 3406.78]  you move
[3406.78 --> 3407.64]  powerfully
[3407.64 --> 3409.02]  as your people
[3409.02 --> 3411.48]  bend their knees
[3411.48 --> 3412.12]  before you
[3412.12 --> 3413.36]  as the sovereign
[3413.36 --> 3413.74]  Lord,
[3414.44 --> 3415.16]  coming in
[3415.16 --> 3415.68]  dependence,
[3415.98 --> 3416.34]  coming in
[3416.34 --> 3416.80]  humility.
[3418.08 --> 3418.50]  And Lord,
[3418.60 --> 3419.30]  in that,
[3420.12 --> 3420.92]  you respond
[3420.92 --> 3421.72]  with your presence.
[3422.92 --> 3423.40]  So Lord,
[3423.46 --> 3424.50]  we come before you
[3424.50 --> 3426.42]  as a church,
[3426.56 --> 3427.32]  as individuals.
[3428.72 --> 3428.92]  Lord,
[3429.00 --> 3429.80]  we give up
[3429.80 --> 3430.72]  the circumstances
[3430.72 --> 3431.36]  of our lives,
[3431.42 --> 3432.44]  whatever those may be
[3432.44 --> 3433.38]  for each one of us,
[3433.88 --> 3434.46]  the circumstance
[3434.46 --> 3435.22]  of our church
[3435.22 --> 3436.08]  and where we are
[3436.08 --> 3437.06]  in our life together.
[3438.06 --> 3438.36]  And Lord,
[3438.40 --> 3439.32]  we bring it before you.
[3440.28 --> 3440.88]  Would you
[3440.88 --> 3442.06]  be at work
[3442.06 --> 3442.74]  in us?
[3443.04 --> 3443.58]  And would you
[3443.58 --> 3444.26]  move us
[3444.26 --> 3445.96]  to glorify your name?
[3446.08 --> 3447.22]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3447.72 --> 3447.98]  Amen.
[3448.74 --> 3449.68]  So let's sing
[3449.68 --> 3450.84]  our song
[3450.84 --> 3451.56]  of response
[3451.56 --> 3452.10]  together.
[3452.10 --> 3452.26]  Amen.
[3452.26 --> 3452.60]  Amen.
[3470.88 --> 3482.68]  God and
[3482.68 --> 3483.30]  of His
[3483.30 --> 3483.72]  O God Marden
[3483.72 --> 3487.76]  I've signed my rest
[3487.76 --> 3489.72]  Without you
[3490.36 --> 3493.72]  I've sought a prize
[3494.30 --> 3495.72]  You're the one
[3496.84 --> 3499.72]  That has my heart
[3500.96 --> 3505.72]  Lord, I need you
[3506.30 --> 3509.72]  Oh, I need you
[3509.72 --> 3515.72]  Mary, how I need you
[3516.22 --> 3519.72]  My wonderful face
[3519.72 --> 3522.72]  My righteousness
[3522.72 --> 3527.72]  Oh, God, how I need you
[3531.72 --> 3534.72]  With my strength
[3534.72 --> 3537.72]  The grace of God
[3537.72 --> 3543.72]  The world is where you are
[3543.72 --> 3547.72]  Where you are
[3547.72 --> 3550.72]  Lord, I am free
[3550.72 --> 3556.72]  Holiness is my sting
[3556.72 --> 3558.72]  Where you are
[3558.72 --> 3560.72]  Where you are
[3560.72 --> 3562.72]  Lord, I am free
[3562.72 --> 3564.72]  I am free
[3564.72 --> 3568.72]  Holiness is
[3568.72 --> 3570.72]  For you
[3570.72 --> 3572.72]  Lord, I need you
[3572.72 --> 3576.72]  Lord, I need you
[3576.72 --> 3578.72]  Oh, I need you
[3578.72 --> 3580.72]  Every year
[3580.72 --> 3584.72]  Every year
[3584.72 --> 3586.72]  I need you
[3586.72 --> 3588.72]  My one defense
[3588.72 --> 3590.72]  My righteousness
[3590.72 --> 3592.72]  My righteousness
[3592.72 --> 3593.72]  My righteousness
[3593.72 --> 3596.72]  Oh, God, how I need you
[3596.72 --> 3598.72]  How I need you
[3598.72 --> 3600.72]  How I need you
[3604.72 --> 3608.72]  So teach my song to rise to you
[3608.72 --> 3610.72]  When temptation
[3610.72 --> 3614.72]  When temptation comes my way
[3614.72 --> 3616.72]  And I can't stand
[3616.72 --> 3617.72]  And I can't stand
[3617.72 --> 3618.72]  And I can't stand
[3618.72 --> 3620.72]  I fall on you
[3620.72 --> 3622.72]  Jesus, you
[3622.72 --> 3623.72]  Jesus, you're my hope
[3623.72 --> 3624.72]  And I can't stand
[3624.72 --> 3626.72]  And I can't stand
[3626.72 --> 3628.72]  And I can't stand
[3628.72 --> 3630.72]  I fall on you
[3630.72 --> 3632.72]  Jesus, you're my hope
[3632.72 --> 3634.72]  Jesus, you're my hope
[3634.72 --> 3636.72]  And I can't stand
[3636.72 --> 3638.72]  Lord, I need you
[3638.72 --> 3640.72]  Oh, I need you
[3640.72 --> 3642.72]  Lord, I need you
[3642.72 --> 3645.72]  Oh, I need you
[3645.72 --> 3647.72]  Every hour I need you
[3647.72 --> 3651.72]  Every hour I need you
[3651.72 --> 3653.72]  My one defense
[3653.72 --> 3655.72]  My righteousness
[3655.72 --> 3657.72]  My righteousness
[3657.72 --> 3659.72]  Oh, God, how I need you
[3659.72 --> 3662.72]  Oh, I need you
[3662.72 --> 3672.72]  My one defense
[3672.72 --> 3673.72]  My righteousness
[3673.72 --> 3676.72]  Oh, God, how I need you
[3676.72 --> 3680.72]  How I need you
[3680.72 --> 3696.12]  Our offering today is for our Christian Education Fund.
[3696.12 --> 3704.12]  This fund is to help families and individuals in our congregation pay for Christian education at any level.
[3704.94 --> 3709.02]  You may mail in or drop off your offering or donate online.
[3709.76 --> 3710.30]  Thank you.
[3710.72 --> 3732.68]  Before we pray our community prayer, please be in prayer throughout this week for Joan, Kathy, Tim, who has received some discouraging news regarding his health, and Cor, who has been transferred to a different hospital for further assessment.
[3733.68 --> 3738.68]  Pray, too, for Andre, that he may regain his mobility.
[3738.68 --> 3741.30]  Let us pray.
[3745.30 --> 3752.12]  Almighty God, gracious Father, in the presence of your bounty, keep us humble.
[3752.94 --> 3759.58]  In the presence of all people's needs, make us compassionate and caring.
[3759.58 --> 3774.28]  Give us faith in our praying and love in our serving, knowing that by your power all may find a new balance in living and a new victory in adversity.
[3774.28 --> 3780.50]  Contain the spread of this terrible and insidious pandemic, O God.
[3780.50 --> 3785.30]  Protect our elderly and those suffering from chronic disease.
[3785.30 --> 3794.26]  For the young and the strong, God, give them the necessary caution to keep them from unwittingly spreading this disease.
[3795.30 --> 3796.74]  Inspire them to help.
[3796.74 --> 3807.86]  For our local, provincial, and federal governments, God help our elected officials as they allocate the necessary resources for combating this pandemic.
[3807.86 --> 3821.60]  For our scientific community, leading the charge to understand the disease and communicate its gravity, God give them knowledge, wisdom, and a persuasive voice.
[3822.48 --> 3832.12]  Keep us from anxiety and panic and enable us to implement the recommended strategies, even at a cost to ourselves.
[3832.12 --> 3843.34]  For those with mental and other health challenges who feel isolated, anxious, and helpless, God provide them every necessary support.
[3844.18 --> 3858.56]  For Christian missionaries throughout the world, especially in areas with high rates of infection, God provide them with words of hope and equip them to love and serve those around them.
[3858.56 --> 3888.54]  We pray especially for those with mental and health, especially in areas with mental health, and other health, and other health, and other health, and other health.
[3888.54 --> 3893.10]  And at all times through faith, the gift of your indwelling peace.
