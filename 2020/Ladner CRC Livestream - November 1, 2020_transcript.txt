[292.00 --> 293.00]  Good morning.
[293.00 --> 294.00]  Good morning.
[294.00 --> 299.00]  Welcome to all those gathered here and to those who are joining in livestream at home,
[299.00 --> 302.00]  or wherever you may be.
[302.00 --> 308.00]  Together, we form part of Christ's body right here in Lab B.C.
[308.00 --> 311.00]  Today is World Hunger Sunday.
[311.00 --> 318.00]  Our offering is for World Renew and the Canadian Food Grains Bank,
[318.00 --> 328.00]  who partner to bring food to the hungry in places like refugee camps where there's war,
[328.00 --> 336.00]  disaster violence, where people are unable to have a sustainable source of food.
[336.00 --> 342.00]  This offering is matched by our Canadian government four to one.
[342.00 --> 347.00]  So every dollar that we give translates to five, which is a great deal from the government.
[347.00 --> 353.00]  So we're thankful for that, and it's a great opportunity.
[353.00 --> 358.00]  You can donate online or mail or drop off a check of the church if you'd like to do that.
[358.00 --> 367.00]  So just a word of thanks this morning to our technical team, John and Lori, and to our worship team, Jane and Marianne.
[367.00 --> 373.00]  And I'm also the champion for World Renew in this church.
[373.00 --> 379.00]  And today, I just want to talk a little bit about our theme for World Hunger Sunday, which is today.
[379.00 --> 386.00]  The theme is every table.
[386.00 --> 394.00]  Roy Birkenbosch, who is an advocate for World Renew and a worker for them, has some thoughts about every table.
[394.00 --> 400.00]  And you can see a few different tables to my left or right.
[400.00 --> 408.00]  He says, every table ought to be full of good things to eat.
[408.00 --> 415.00]  Every table ought to be a place for breaking bread and joyful fellowship.
[415.00 --> 424.00]  Every table matters and should be considered in our political and economic choices.
[424.00 --> 427.00]  Every table matters to God.
[427.00 --> 433.00]  Every table is a place where God desires to be present.
[433.00 --> 441.00]  Every table is a place where God desires to be recognized and celebrated.
[441.00 --> 449.00]  Yet, we know that not every table is yet well set.
[449.00 --> 454.00]  Not yet a place of sharing and generous fellowship.
[454.00 --> 458.00]  Not yet a place where God is known.
[458.00 --> 466.00]  Today, we desire what God desires, but live with the hard reality of poverty and hunger.
[466.00 --> 472.00]  This is the context of World Renew's ministry.
[472.00 --> 479.00]  Our invitation for worship this morning comes from John 6, verse 35.
[479.00 --> 481.00]  Then Jesus declared,
[481.00 --> 484.00]  I am the bread of life.
[484.00 --> 487.00]  Whoever comes to me will never go hungry.
[487.00 --> 492.00]  And whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
[492.00 --> 495.00]  Would you rise for God's greeting, please?
[495.00 --> 502.00]  This greeting comes to us and is a paraphrase from Ephesians 1.
[502.00 --> 508.00]  To God's holy people in Ladner, the faithful in Christ Jesus,
[508.00 --> 514.00]  grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[514.00 --> 535.00]  Take a moment to greet one another with a wave or maybe an air hug.
[535.00 --> 536.00]  Worship with us.
[536.00 --> 550.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[550.00 --> 555.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[555.00 --> 559.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[559.00 --> 582.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[582.00 --> 592.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[592.00 --> 597.00]  Come all you people, come and praise your maker.
[597.00 --> 602.00]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[612.00 --> 613.00]  And worship and worship and There is that you may know.
[613.00 --> 615.00]  Let's have a way of patience.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  Let's worship this, you may know.
[617.00 --> 619.02]  And have a name left
[619.02 --> 620.56]  Sometimes you précis, but when it's funny.
[620.56 --> 625.00]  Let's glow the eyes, получается.
[625.00 --> 631.00]  Here is to the aura Ravi,
[631.00 --> 636.00]  Remember to let Swami Lşorziorte ISO 109 that he is a set-up Tambchemist.
[636.00 --> 639.00]  Here comes to his kingdom wrapped in a dirable suit for Y glprocessing.
[639.00 --> 643.14]  From the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens,
[643.14 --> 648.90]  From the depths of the heavens, your name we praise.
[648.90 --> 657.70]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong,
[657.80 --> 666.78]  From the lips of all people, this song we raise, Lord.
[666.78 --> 678.84]  Exalted in endless ages, we will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[679.84 --> 689.78]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[689.78 --> 696.78]  Be magnified, be magnified.
[696.78 --> 701.78]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all people, this song we praise.
[701.78 --> 717.78]  From the depths of the sea, from the depths of the heavens, your name we praise.
[717.78 --> 722.78]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all people, this song we praise, Lord.
[722.78 --> 732.78]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all people, this song we praise, Lord.
[732.78 --> 747.78]  We praise, Lord, throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[747.78 --> 754.78]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all people, this song we praise, Lord, most high.
[754.78 --> 758.78]  Re Barnumatous lord, most high.
[759.78 --> 767.78]  Verse 5, Mary, as I know as I know as I know of men and again, I haveoto here.
[767.78 --> 774.40]  As I know as I know of Lord, I haveoto here.
[774.40 --> 795.66]  I am free, I come to you, for I am satisfied.
[795.66 --> 806.66]  I am empty, but I know your love does not run dry.
[806.66 --> 816.66]  So I wait for you, so I wait for you.
[816.66 --> 826.66]  I am calling on my knees, offering all on me.
[826.66 --> 834.66]  Jesus, your always heart is living for me.
[834.66 --> 851.66]  I am free, I come to you, for your arms are open wide.
[851.66 --> 860.66]  I am weary, but I know your love does not run dry.
[860.66 --> 870.66]  So I wait for you, so I wait for you.
[870.66 --> 879.66]  I am free, I am free, I am free.
[879.66 --> 886.66]  Jesus, your always heart is living for me.
[886.66 --> 893.66]  I am free, I am free.
[893.66 --> 898.66]  I am free, I am free.
[898.66 --> 903.66]  I am free, I am free.
[903.66 --> 911.66]  Jesus, your always heart is living for me.
[911.66 --> 932.66]  You may be seated.
[932.66 --> 936.66]  Please join us in the litany for World Hunger.
[936.66 --> 945.66]  O God, what love you have lavished on us, that we can call ourselves your children.
[945.66 --> 948.66]  We are no longer foreigners and strangers.
[948.66 --> 951.66]  We are fellow citizens with your people.
[951.66 --> 954.66]  We are members of your household.
[954.66 --> 957.66]  Your welcome is extravagant.
[957.66 --> 958.66]  Welcome to God.
[958.66 --> 963.66]  You invite us to the feast of both heaven and earth.
[963.66 --> 966.66]  To your table of plenty.
[966.66 --> 970.66]  You provide for all that we need.
[970.66 --> 976.66]  You have made us alive in Christ, and you seat us next to him at your table.
[976.66 --> 982.66]  The riches of your grace are ours to enjoy.
[982.66 --> 986.66]  But your table is not just for us.
[986.66 --> 991.66]  Your banquet is for the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind.
[991.66 --> 993.66]  You remember the poor.
[993.66 --> 996.66]  You are the Pope of the afflicted.
[996.66 --> 1005.66]  We wonder if we can be like Jesus, who said his food was to do your will and finish your work.
[1005.66 --> 1012.66]  Can we set aside our own interests and carry around our others' burdens?
[1012.66 --> 1015.66]  You call us your handiwork.
[1015.66 --> 1019.66]  You say you created us in Christ Jesus to do good works.
[1019.66 --> 1022.66]  You have prepared those works in advance.
[1022.66 --> 1026.66]  O Holy History!
[1026.66 --> 1033.66]  You say that if we hunger and thirst for righteousness, that we will be satisfied.
[1033.66 --> 1040.66]  You promise that we will be made strong with all the strength that comes from your glorious power.
[1040.66 --> 1047.66]  This is the feast of heaven and earth. Let this be all that we need.
[1047.66 --> 1074.66]  From today's willale a part of the Constitution on our own right speech.
[1074.66 --> 1084.42]  you god be glory in church and in christ jesus throughout all generations forever and ever
[1093.94 --> 1104.42]  feel free to stand for this next song
[1104.66 --> 1113.38]  yes
[1113.38 --> 1125.92]  In just bliss flow down, down like a river, down to the valleys where the helpless wide
[1125.92 --> 1130.80]  And what does this flow through us forever?
[1130.80 --> 1136.54]  Lead us to the stream that will never run dry
[1136.54 --> 1146.54]  Flow to the mouths of the hungry, flow to the heads of the poor
[1146.54 --> 1156.54]  Flow to the hearts of the orphans, feed in the wounds of poor
[1156.54 --> 1166.54]  In just bliss flow down, down like a river, down to the valleys where the helpless wide
[1166.54 --> 1171.54]  With riches must flow through us forever
[1171.54 --> 1176.54]  Lead us to the stream that will never run dry
[1176.54 --> 1186.54]  Flow to the streets of the homeless, finding a place they will know
[1186.54 --> 1196.54]  Flow to the cells of the prisoners, facing each day alone
[1196.54 --> 1206.54]  Flow to the people who are in the midst of the homeless
[1206.54 --> 1208.54]  In just bliss flow down, down like a river, down to the valleys where the helpless wide
[1208.54 --> 1212.54]  With riches must flow through us forever
[1212.54 --> 1218.54]  Lead us to the stream that will never run dry
[1218.54 --> 1222.54]  Flow to the courts of our nation
[1222.54 --> 1227.54]  Guide us to the stream that will never run dry
[1227.54 --> 1229.54]  Give us to the stream that will never run dry
[1229.54 --> 1232.54]  Fill us to the realms of salvation
[1232.54 --> 1237.54]  Fill our land with peace
[1237.54 --> 1243.54]  Let justice flow down, down like a river
[1243.54 --> 1247.54]  Down to the valleys where the helpless wide
[1247.54 --> 1251.54]  With riches must flow through us forever
[1251.54 --> 1259.52]  Give us forever, lead us to the stream that will never run dry.
[1281.54 --> 1287.64]  Good morning to all of you here and to all those at home.
[1292.44 --> 1298.92]  And so as a church, we are in the season of ordinary time.
[1299.20 --> 1311.18]  That is the season after, you know, we celebrate the life of Christ and his birth and advent and his ministry and epiphany, his suffering and death and Lent, his resurrection and Easter.
[1311.18 --> 1312.94]  And that brings us halfway through the year.
[1313.50 --> 1324.04]  And then the other half of the year called ordinary time, we turn our attention to considering what does it mean to take all that Jesus has done and accomplished and to live it out in our lives and in this world.
[1324.46 --> 1334.94]  And so it's a great time to talk about kind of the theme that we are talking about together, which is what does it mean for us to join God in his mission in the world?
[1334.94 --> 1341.42]  And to consider that question where we've been going through a sermon series in the book of Acts.
[1342.92 --> 1358.22]  And each week we've been asking the same question, which is how does this passage that we look at that week instruct us and invite us to join God in his mission to renew this whole world?
[1358.22 --> 1363.50]  And so each week we've seen the kind of a different answer to that question.
[1364.14 --> 1372.60]  And in our passage today, the answer to that is that we join God's mission in the world by living faithfully.
[1373.38 --> 1374.52]  Okay, by living faithfully.
[1374.82 --> 1382.04]  That we join God's mission by living faithfully to whatever situation that God has called us into.
[1382.04 --> 1384.92]  And so that's what we're going to look at today.
[1385.02 --> 1386.54]  It's this call to live faithfully.
[1387.44 --> 1393.72]  And today I'm going to do something a bit different, which is I'm going to read the passage as I preach.
[1394.50 --> 1397.68]  Normally I just read the whole thing first and then we kind of unpack it as we go.
[1397.88 --> 1402.88]  But I think this passage this week kind of warrants us to kind of take it section by section.
[1403.20 --> 1406.04]  So let me pray first and then we will jump in.
[1406.28 --> 1406.82]  So let's pray.
[1406.82 --> 1416.18]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are the God who feeds all who look to you.
[1417.10 --> 1421.24]  Lord, you have fed us this morning physically.
[1422.36 --> 1426.80]  But Lord, also we come to you that we might be fed spiritually.
[1428.18 --> 1429.38]  Lord, we are hungry.
[1430.42 --> 1434.58]  And Lord, we need your life to sustain us.
[1434.58 --> 1439.60]  The bread of life, the Lord Jesus Christ, to nurture us, to make us grow.
[1440.22 --> 1442.30]  So Lord, we come and we do seek to grow.
[1442.46 --> 1445.20]  We seek to be nourished by you through your word.
[1445.94 --> 1454.56]  And so Lord, would you prepare our hearts to feast with you as we commune with you in this time and to hear your word to us.
[1454.74 --> 1455.78]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1455.98 --> 1456.22]  Amen.
[1456.22 --> 1456.30]  Amen.
[1457.74 --> 1464.22]  So I know that some of you are into or have been into the show Downton Abbey.
[1465.04 --> 1468.28]  And so for those of you who are not familiar with it, it's a BBC production.
[1468.64 --> 1472.58]  And it's set around the time of the outbreak of World War I.
[1472.58 --> 1479.28]  And it's all about this English manor estate, this grand estate in England.
[1479.64 --> 1489.28]  And it's about this previous way of life, which is a very kind of ordered, aristocratic way of life.
[1490.04 --> 1498.16]  And so the show follows the lives of the servants who live downstairs and then the upper class aristocrats who live upstairs.
[1498.34 --> 1501.72]  And so each episode follows the lives of these kind of two groups of people.
[1501.72 --> 1504.56]  So I thought it'd be fun to share a picture.
[1504.94 --> 1507.22]  Probably many of you recognize these fellows.
[1508.18 --> 1511.80]  On that side, the left, is Lord Grantham.
[1511.88 --> 1513.16]  He's the lord of the estate.
[1514.04 --> 1518.34]  And he represents the upstairs, the aristocratic lifestyle.
[1519.08 --> 1522.62]  And then on the right there is Mr. Carson.
[1523.16 --> 1527.42]  And Mr. Carson is the butler in charge of all the servants downstairs.
[1527.42 --> 1533.20]  For Mr. Carson, heaven is two footmen in the dining room serving tea to perfection.
[1534.48 --> 1536.34]  Okay, so we can take that off.
[1537.20 --> 1544.02]  And so the show is about the expectations and the rigidity that went along with that time period.
[1544.02 --> 1548.32]  And it's about the downfall of that way of life.
[1548.94 --> 1558.06]  And because that way of life was slipping away from everybody as the world and as the culture is changing around them.
[1558.06 --> 1563.12]  And in fact, now it's been almost 100 years later.
[1563.78 --> 1569.24]  And that way of life is about as opposite from our way of life today as you could get.
[1569.78 --> 1569.92]  Right?
[1570.02 --> 1574.16]  Today, our life, our culture, we celebrate autonomy.
[1574.40 --> 1576.52]  We celebrate individuality.
[1576.52 --> 1582.06]  And so for us, we can today reinvent ourselves.
[1582.98 --> 1583.12]  Right?
[1583.20 --> 1588.74]  If you don't like the job you have, you can get a new job.
[1588.80 --> 1589.82]  You can change careers.
[1590.58 --> 1595.22]  If you want to live somewhere else, you can get up and move somewhere else.
[1595.58 --> 1602.08]  If you don't want to take the occupation that your parents had, you can make a new path for yourself.
[1602.08 --> 1608.48]  And that's the opposite of the Downton Abbey world where everything was very rigid and structured.
[1609.18 --> 1618.00]  And so the question is then, why is Downton Abbey so wildly popular in our culture today?
[1619.02 --> 1619.24]  Right?
[1619.32 --> 1627.42]  Why in our culture of so much freedom and autonomy do we love to kind of look back at this world that was so structured and rigid?
[1627.92 --> 1629.36]  Why do people really love this show?
[1629.36 --> 1635.94]  And so Elizabeth McGovern is the actress who plays the Countess of Grantham.
[1636.90 --> 1639.08]  And so she is the head woman of the estate.
[1639.42 --> 1641.92]  And they asked her in an interview just to talk about this.
[1641.98 --> 1643.08]  Why is this show so popular?
[1643.62 --> 1644.74]  So here's what she said.
[1646.14 --> 1652.70]  In today's world, we all live with a burden of feeling that anything is possible.
[1653.56 --> 1658.18]  If we're only clever enough, smart enough, work hard enough.
[1658.18 --> 1661.98]  And there's something, of course, marvelous about that.
[1662.24 --> 1668.20]  I wouldn't go back to the old way, but I think there was a comfort for people in knowing this is their role.
[1668.94 --> 1670.48]  This is their place.
[1671.20 --> 1672.64]  There's no pressure about it.
[1672.96 --> 1675.66]  You just do the most wonderful job you can.
[1675.66 --> 1678.66]  And I think what she says is very insightful.
[1679.76 --> 1688.86]  You know, because she's saying how in our world today, we have so much freedom, but there's a burden that comes along with that.
[1689.42 --> 1692.42]  There's a burden that anything is possible.
[1692.42 --> 1703.88]  And the burden is that it's up to us to navigate all of that freedom, all of those choices, and that we, in that way, have to kind of make the right choices.
[1703.98 --> 1705.76]  And we have to kind of create ourselves.
[1706.98 --> 1711.14]  And that's actually, for many young people today, there's so much choice.
[1711.22 --> 1712.84]  It's almost they don't know what to choose.
[1713.10 --> 1714.30]  And it's very stressful.
[1714.30 --> 1716.88]  And so it is a burden.
[1717.84 --> 1726.60]  And I think what it means to be a Christian is that we don't have the burden to invent ourselves.
[1727.44 --> 1734.40]  You don't have to create yourselves through choosing a career or a spouse or where you live and all these other choices.
[1734.74 --> 1741.58]  We don't have to succeed, make the right choices, and then make ourselves because Christ is our life.
[1741.58 --> 1743.56]  Our life has been given to us.
[1744.24 --> 1746.38]  And it's God's job to make us.
[1746.40 --> 1750.90]  That doesn't mean, of course, we don't make choices, but the burden doesn't rest on us.
[1752.14 --> 1760.20]  And so, therefore, we are free as Christians to just do the most wonderful job as you can as the person that God has created us to be.
[1760.72 --> 1761.06]  Right?
[1761.12 --> 1763.54]  And with the life that God has given us to live.
[1764.64 --> 1768.52]  And so there is great freedom and there is great contentment in that.
[1768.76 --> 1770.20]  It takes the burden off.
[1770.20 --> 1780.98]  And so today, we're going to look briefly in our passage at four different figures, four characters that we see.
[1781.62 --> 1784.18]  Each of these characters, their lives are very different.
[1784.34 --> 1785.88]  They're really different people.
[1785.96 --> 1786.82]  They have different personalities.
[1787.02 --> 1790.06]  They have different roles and lives that God has given them.
[1790.36 --> 1795.04]  But each of them faithfully embrace the life that God has given them.
[1795.04 --> 1804.24]  And so today, what I hope to do is to look at their lives and see how God used their lives in different ways for his mission.
[1805.24 --> 1808.32]  And I hope for us that we can be inspired.
[1808.72 --> 1812.28]  That we can kind of look at these different lives and how God used them.
[1812.50 --> 1819.50]  And then to just reflect and ask the question, well, you know, kind of open up our imagination and ask, how can God use me?
[1819.50 --> 1820.32]  You know, I'm different.
[1820.78 --> 1822.12]  I'm this kind of person.
[1822.88 --> 1824.84]  I have this life that God has placed me in.
[1824.88 --> 1829.04]  Well, what does it mean for me to be faithful to this life that God has given me?
[1830.46 --> 1832.46]  Okay, so we're going to look at these different people.
[1832.86 --> 1835.80]  And the first person in our passage is Saul.
[1836.82 --> 1839.24]  And we're going to read a bit of the passage.
[1839.46 --> 1842.74]  But before we do that, here's just a quick bit of background about it.
[1842.74 --> 1845.24]  Last week, we saw Paul's conversion.
[1845.56 --> 1847.42]  Remember, Paul was on his way to Damascus.
[1847.48 --> 1848.14]  And what was he doing?
[1849.24 --> 1851.10]  He was pursuing Christians.
[1851.40 --> 1853.34]  He was going to find any Christians.
[1853.62 --> 1856.18]  He was going to throw them in jail back in Jerusalem.
[1856.70 --> 1858.58]  So he was trying to stamp out Christianity.
[1859.22 --> 1860.42]  But he's going along.
[1860.52 --> 1862.60]  He meets Jesus on the road to Damascus.
[1862.98 --> 1869.78]  And he becomes a Christian through the gracious welcome of Ananias in the Christian community.
[1869.78 --> 1874.24]  So then all of a sudden, his world is completely turned upside down.
[1875.18 --> 1878.84]  Okay, so now we will read, starting in verse, end of verse 19.
[1880.52 --> 1881.62]  So here's Saul.
[1881.96 --> 1885.34]  Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
[1885.40 --> 1886.58]  So this is right after his conversion.
[1888.10 --> 1893.10]  At once, he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
[1894.10 --> 1897.16]  All those who heard him were astonished and asked,
[1897.16 --> 1899.70]  Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem?
[1900.12 --> 1902.48]  Among those who call on this name?
[1903.32 --> 1907.68]  And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?
[1908.84 --> 1913.42]  Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus
[1913.42 --> 1916.82]  by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
[1918.16 --> 1923.24]  After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him.
[1923.68 --> 1925.12]  But Saul learned of their plan.
[1925.12 --> 1928.96]  Day and night, they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
[1929.78 --> 1934.40]  But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
[1936.58 --> 1937.38]  That's Saul.
[1938.70 --> 1941.28]  So right after his conversion, he's in Damascus.
[1942.30 --> 1945.26]  And Saul immediately starts preaching the gospel.
[1945.42 --> 1946.80]  Like, he doesn't miss a beat.
[1946.80 --> 1950.96]  You know, he thinks the gospel is dangerous.
[1952.96 --> 1953.60]  Excuse me.
[1954.40 --> 1957.22]  He thinks these Jesus followers are wrong.
[1958.14 --> 1959.40]  But Jesus meets him.
[1959.78 --> 1964.24]  And immediately, he takes all that energy that he's focusing on pursuing Christians.
[1964.44 --> 1965.88]  And he's just preaching the gospel.
[1966.38 --> 1967.70]  And that's the kind of guy he is.
[1967.72 --> 1968.78]  He's preaching powerfully.
[1969.78 --> 1974.14]  And as a result, he quickly makes enemies with the Jews there who don't accept his message.
[1974.86 --> 1976.88]  So Saul has this death threat against them.
[1977.58 --> 1979.72]  And I've never had a death threat against me.
[1979.80 --> 1982.28]  But I imagine that it's kind of really scary and stressful.
[1983.02 --> 1984.96]  But at the same time, look what happens.
[1985.02 --> 1988.10]  He's being lowered in a basket through a crack in the city walls.
[1988.84 --> 1990.12]  That sounds pretty exciting.
[1990.68 --> 1991.58]  Like, that's kind of cool.
[1992.58 --> 1995.14]  It sounds kind of like this James Bond kind of character.
[1995.50 --> 1995.62]  Right?
[1995.68 --> 1997.66]  He's like, I'm living on the edge for God.
[1997.72 --> 1998.50]  I'm on this adventure.
[1999.00 --> 2000.12]  Like, they're after me.
[2000.20 --> 2001.38]  I'm going to escape through the wall.
[2002.16 --> 2003.44]  And so that was Saul.
[2003.52 --> 2004.54]  He was that kind of a guy.
[2004.60 --> 2005.66]  He was very extreme.
[2006.12 --> 2006.32]  Right?
[2006.36 --> 2009.16]  When he's persecuting the church, he's going to extremes.
[2009.28 --> 2011.42]  He's pursuing Christians all the way to Damascus.
[2011.76 --> 2018.72]  And now, as a Christian, he's just as extreme, living on the edge, preaching the gospel.
[2018.72 --> 2024.16]  And after he escapes from Damascus, he goes down to Jerusalem.
[2025.06 --> 2027.20]  And there, again, the Jews try to kill him.
[2027.54 --> 2030.72]  So eventually, he gets to his home city of Tarsus.
[2031.76 --> 2039.50]  So what we see already is that Saul's life as a follower of Jesus is just this life that's one episode of suffering after another.
[2041.14 --> 2044.72]  And if you remember last week, that's exactly what God told Ananias.
[2044.72 --> 2056.48]  He said to Ananias, go, this man, Saul, is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
[2056.88 --> 2060.82]  I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.
[2061.86 --> 2062.02]  Right?
[2062.10 --> 2063.08]  That is Saul's story.
[2063.94 --> 2073.92]  God's call on Saul's life was to be a missionary to the Gentiles, was to preach Jesus to the people of Israel, and it was to suffer.
[2073.92 --> 2083.78]  And I think the encouragement of Saul's example was not so much to embrace suffering, but to embrace God in the midst of suffering.
[2085.28 --> 2085.38]  Right?
[2085.60 --> 2088.82]  Saul didn't try to reinvent his life.
[2089.02 --> 2091.12]  He didn't say, you know, I don't like this.
[2091.24 --> 2092.24]  I don't like God's plan.
[2092.40 --> 2094.72]  I don't like this call to suffering that God has given me.
[2094.96 --> 2096.92]  I'm going to figure something else out.
[2097.56 --> 2098.40]  What did he do?
[2098.46 --> 2099.58]  He just kept preaching.
[2100.32 --> 2100.54]  Right?
[2100.56 --> 2102.52]  And we see this pattern in the rest of the book of Acts.
[2102.52 --> 2103.30]  He goes to a city.
[2103.44 --> 2104.26]  He preaches the gospel.
[2104.76 --> 2106.56]  His life is threatened, and he has to run.
[2107.78 --> 2112.86]  And he goes through all of these tribulations, and it's this call to suffering.
[2112.98 --> 2114.22]  And he's faithful in it.
[2114.36 --> 2115.56]  He just keeps going.
[2115.68 --> 2119.24]  He's faithful to God in the life that God has given him.
[2120.18 --> 2122.14]  Okay, so that's the first cameo that we see.
[2122.30 --> 2122.82]  This is Saul.
[2122.82 --> 2127.58]  Now, the next figure we come to in our passage is this man, Barnabas.
[2127.94 --> 2132.62]  So let's look at our next section about Barnabas.
[2133.18 --> 2140.84]  So when, in verse 26, when he came to Jerusalem, this is Saul, he tried to join the disciples there.
[2141.08 --> 2144.84]  But they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
[2144.84 --> 2149.08]  But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles.
[2150.02 --> 2155.30]  He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him,
[2155.74 --> 2159.38]  and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
[2160.48 --> 2166.96]  So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
[2167.34 --> 2171.50]  He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
[2171.50 --> 2177.82]  When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
[2179.18 --> 2180.30]  All right, so Barnabas.
[2180.94 --> 2184.82]  Now, remember, Barnabas we actually met earlier in Acts chapter 4.
[2184.96 --> 2189.08]  He was the guy, remember, who had the field and who sold the field that he owned.
[2189.16 --> 2194.16]  He gave the money to the church so that the poor in the community could be cared for.
[2194.54 --> 2200.48]  And there, in Acts chapter 4, we learn that Barnabas has a name that was given to him, a nickname,
[2200.48 --> 2202.92]  and it means son of encouragement.
[2204.22 --> 2206.60]  And so at this point in the life of the church,
[2206.84 --> 2212.62]  Barnabas might have become one of the most influential and respected leaders in the church.
[2213.32 --> 2219.60]  And so early on, what we see is as the first churches are being started outside of Jerusalem,
[2219.82 --> 2222.14]  right, there's a church that starts in Antioch,
[2222.14 --> 2228.58]  it was Barnabas who was sent to confirm the church and to go encourage them.
[2229.22 --> 2232.44]  So I love what it says about Barnabas' ministry.
[2233.18 --> 2234.88]  And so this is in Acts chapter 11.
[2235.80 --> 2237.84]  And it says about Barnabas,
[2237.84 --> 2252.50]  Right, that's such a lovely passage.
[2253.28 --> 2257.10]  He encouraged them to remain true to the Lord with all of their hearts.
[2257.50 --> 2259.70]  Right, he's just this encouraging guy.
[2259.70 --> 2264.00]  And so that nickname, son of encouragement, is really fitting for his personality.
[2264.82 --> 2268.92]  Right, that is the personality, and that is the role that God had given him,
[2269.12 --> 2271.12]  to be an encourager.
[2272.22 --> 2273.94]  And notice what Barnabas does next.
[2274.02 --> 2276.72]  So he goes to Antioch, he encourages the church,
[2277.92 --> 2281.48]  and then he went back, he got Saul,
[2281.80 --> 2285.08]  and brought him along with him, this new convert to Christianity.
[2285.08 --> 2290.76]  And he gave Saul the opportunity to preach and to teach in Antioch for a whole year.
[2291.36 --> 2296.00]  Essentially, providing this opportunity and opening the door for Saul
[2296.00 --> 2298.92]  to become an influential preacher and teacher.
[2300.28 --> 2304.84]  And so it was Barnabas who likely was the mentor of Saul
[2304.84 --> 2308.42]  as he became a Christian, and he had to learn what it means to be a Christian.
[2309.60 --> 2311.18]  And actually, if you read closely,
[2311.18 --> 2314.66]  the first couple missionary journeys that we read in the book of Acts
[2314.66 --> 2320.58]  are actually Barnabas' journeys that Saul just joins in on.
[2321.54 --> 2323.06]  Okay, so here's Barnabas.
[2323.44 --> 2326.86]  He's a well-respected, established leader in the church.
[2327.28 --> 2330.26]  He has this reputation that is unparalleled.
[2331.28 --> 2332.70]  And then here in chapter 9,
[2334.36 --> 2336.30]  Saul comes to Jerusalem.
[2337.34 --> 2340.66]  Everyone there only knows Saul as this crazy guy
[2340.66 --> 2342.38]  who's just persecuting the church.
[2342.38 --> 2344.52]  And so they don't trust him.
[2344.62 --> 2346.48]  They think maybe this is some sort of trick.
[2346.60 --> 2348.00]  He's not a true disciple.
[2348.48 --> 2350.06]  So what does Barnabas do?
[2351.78 --> 2353.44]  So it says in verse 26,
[2353.78 --> 2356.50]  When he came to Jerusalem, Saul tried to join the disciples,
[2356.80 --> 2358.06]  but they were all afraid of him,
[2358.30 --> 2359.74]  not believing he was really a disciple.
[2360.16 --> 2362.04]  So Barnabas, verse 27,
[2362.72 --> 2363.18]  it says,
[2363.18 --> 2377.64]  So do you see what Barnabas is doing?
[2378.22 --> 2382.18]  Barnabas is taking the respect that he has,
[2382.52 --> 2384.44]  the high standing that he has,
[2384.48 --> 2387.10]  and the trust that he has in the community,
[2387.10 --> 2389.36]  and he's going to the apostles,
[2389.52 --> 2390.50]  these early church leaders,
[2390.64 --> 2391.16]  and he's saying,
[2391.68 --> 2393.92]  he's asking them to trust Saul
[2393.92 --> 2396.02]  just like they trust him.
[2397.76 --> 2399.92]  And Barnabas was so well-respected
[2399.92 --> 2402.32]  that apparently his word was enough.
[2403.06 --> 2404.98]  Because what we see in verse 28,
[2405.12 --> 2405.94]  it simply says,
[2406.70 --> 2407.84]  Saul stayed with them
[2407.84 --> 2409.56]  and moved about freely in Jerusalem,
[2410.50 --> 2412.36]  speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
[2412.36 --> 2413.16]  Right?
[2413.32 --> 2415.58]  He now had the complete trust
[2415.58 --> 2416.68]  of the church in Jerusalem
[2416.68 --> 2419.50]  because Barnabas spoke for him.
[2420.06 --> 2421.80]  So that's who we see Barnabas is.
[2422.32 --> 2423.96]  He's the encourager of the church.
[2424.10 --> 2427.48]  He's an advocate who uses his influence
[2427.48 --> 2430.22]  to then enable and empower others.
[2430.82 --> 2431.76]  That's who he is.
[2432.04 --> 2433.06]  He's kind of this guy
[2433.06 --> 2434.86]  who's working behind the scenes,
[2434.94 --> 2435.68]  just encouraging,
[2435.94 --> 2437.96]  enabling people to use their gifts,
[2438.70 --> 2439.86]  keeping things moving,
[2440.34 --> 2441.96]  but just very kind of unassuming.
[2442.36 --> 2442.90]  Kind of guy.
[2444.12 --> 2444.26]  Right?
[2444.28 --> 2444.98]  So that's Barnabas.
[2446.20 --> 2448.24]  So now our third person is Peter.
[2449.20 --> 2451.42]  And the shape of Peter's life
[2451.42 --> 2452.48]  was different.
[2453.34 --> 2453.46]  Right?
[2453.54 --> 2455.86]  So if Saul is this kind of action figure,
[2455.96 --> 2456.70]  James Bond guy,
[2456.76 --> 2457.62]  on the front lines,
[2457.78 --> 2458.58]  preaching the gospel,
[2459.24 --> 2461.42]  and where Barnabas is kind of this encourager,
[2461.56 --> 2462.30]  he's a catalyst,
[2462.90 --> 2464.22]  he's behind the scenes,
[2465.32 --> 2467.98]  Peter is really kind of depicted
[2467.98 --> 2469.36]  as a faithful pastor.
[2469.64 --> 2470.56]  That's who Peter is.
[2470.56 --> 2474.42]  So let's look at Peter's profile here.
[2475.32 --> 2477.32]  So this is verses 32 to 35.
[2479.32 --> 2481.20]  As Peter traveled about the country,
[2481.78 --> 2483.24]  he went to visit the Lord's people
[2483.24 --> 2484.08]  who lived in Lydda,
[2485.28 --> 2485.74]  or Lydda.
[2486.40 --> 2489.56]  There he found a man named Ananias,
[2489.78 --> 2490.94]  who was paralyzed
[2490.94 --> 2493.34]  and had been bedridden for eight years.
[2493.34 --> 2495.62]  Ananias,
[2496.34 --> 2497.26]  Peter said to him,
[2499.72 --> 2500.98]  or is that Aeneas?
[2501.14 --> 2501.36]  Sorry.
[2501.66 --> 2502.02]  Aeneas.
[2503.28 --> 2504.82]  Jesus Christ heals you.
[2504.94 --> 2506.16]  Get up and roll up your mat.
[2507.02 --> 2507.58]  Immediately,
[2508.10 --> 2509.08]  Aeneas got up.
[2509.34 --> 2510.78]  All those who lived in Lydda
[2510.78 --> 2512.20]  and Sharon saw him
[2512.20 --> 2513.86]  and turned to the Lord.
[2514.86 --> 2516.22]  Okay, so here's Peter.
[2516.22 --> 2519.22]  And I love the way Luke describes it.
[2519.76 --> 2521.22]  That first verse,
[2521.78 --> 2523.76]  Peter, he's traveling around the country.
[2524.18 --> 2526.16]  He's just going from place to place.
[2527.10 --> 2528.86]  So the church was beginning,
[2529.40 --> 2531.34]  again, to move outside of Jerusalem.
[2531.92 --> 2533.40]  And it's beginning to expand.
[2533.60 --> 2535.34]  And so Lydda and Sharon,
[2536.08 --> 2537.34]  they're cities on the coast.
[2538.10 --> 2541.24]  So Peter is probably going up and down the coast,
[2541.86 --> 2542.70]  visiting churches,
[2542.70 --> 2544.88]  kind of just visiting the congregations.
[2545.02 --> 2545.54]  He's traveling.
[2545.72 --> 2546.28]  He's preaching.
[2546.92 --> 2548.50]  He's visiting the Lord's people.
[2549.52 --> 2551.64]  And he's just doing his pastor thing.
[2552.42 --> 2554.22]  And then this guy, Aeneas,
[2554.60 --> 2556.68]  gets thrown into his lap.
[2557.20 --> 2557.28]  Right?
[2557.40 --> 2558.14]  He didn't, you know,
[2558.22 --> 2559.48]  Peter didn't wake up and say,
[2559.86 --> 2560.10]  you know,
[2560.26 --> 2562.46]  I think I'm going to heal somebody today.
[2563.16 --> 2564.36]  No, he's just being faithful
[2564.36 --> 2565.52]  to his call as a pastor.
[2565.68 --> 2567.54]  He's going from church to church
[2567.54 --> 2569.24]  and any needs that arises,
[2569.60 --> 2570.20]  he's there.
[2570.20 --> 2571.66]  He's going to minister to the people
[2571.66 --> 2572.38]  and serve them.
[2573.38 --> 2574.82]  And remember, Peter,
[2575.28 --> 2578.06]  that Jesus had given him
[2578.06 --> 2579.28]  that very commission.
[2579.98 --> 2580.12]  Right?
[2580.20 --> 2581.58]  After he was raised from the dead,
[2581.72 --> 2582.48]  Jesus says,
[2583.14 --> 2584.88]  Peter, if you love me,
[2585.56 --> 2586.06]  do what?
[2587.76 --> 2588.92]  Feed my sheep.
[2589.24 --> 2589.94]  Feed my flock.
[2590.46 --> 2592.06]  And that's what Peter was doing.
[2592.56 --> 2593.82]  He's doing the thing
[2593.82 --> 2595.92]  that God had placed in front of him.
[2597.26 --> 2598.72]  And so this is what we see Peter doing.
[2598.72 --> 2601.12]  He's not concerned with missing out
[2601.12 --> 2603.14]  on the adventures that Saul is having.
[2603.68 --> 2604.62]  You know, he's not saying,
[2604.78 --> 2606.56]  how come I never get to escape in the night
[2606.56 --> 2607.98]  and be lowered down in a basket?
[2608.70 --> 2609.52]  He's not saying,
[2609.60 --> 2611.10]  why don't I have the authority
[2611.10 --> 2612.74]  and the influence of Barnabas?
[2613.72 --> 2614.74]  He's not doing that.
[2614.80 --> 2616.00]  He's just going around
[2616.00 --> 2617.42]  and he's caring for the churches
[2617.42 --> 2619.00]  because that's the call
[2619.00 --> 2620.26]  that God had given him.
[2620.80 --> 2622.84]  And he's being faithful to it.
[2623.22 --> 2624.70]  And he's embracing the call
[2624.70 --> 2625.66]  that God has given him.
[2625.66 --> 2627.06]  Right?
[2627.12 --> 2628.86]  And so that's a brief snapshot
[2628.86 --> 2630.02]  of Peter's life.
[2631.12 --> 2632.26]  And the last figure
[2632.26 --> 2634.58]  our passage talks about
[2634.58 --> 2635.80]  is this woman named Dorcas.
[2636.90 --> 2640.08]  Dorcas is a relatively minor figure
[2640.08 --> 2641.50]  in the book of Acts.
[2641.90 --> 2645.24]  But as I was looking at Dorcas' life this week,
[2645.72 --> 2648.30]  I discovered that she is a fascinating
[2648.30 --> 2650.12]  and wonderful person
[2650.12 --> 2652.38]  because she's only really mentioned here.
[2652.38 --> 2654.14]  But when you look at her life,
[2654.38 --> 2655.68]  she's really quite incredible.
[2656.08 --> 2657.40]  So let's look at,
[2657.52 --> 2660.30]  read verses 36 to 42.
[2661.76 --> 2662.80]  In Joppa,
[2663.20 --> 2665.22]  there was a disciple named Tabitha.
[2665.66 --> 2667.08]  In Greek, her name is Dorcas.
[2667.18 --> 2668.58]  So in Aramaic,
[2668.88 --> 2669.84]  her name is Tabitha.
[2669.92 --> 2671.34]  In Greek, it's Dorcas.
[2672.12 --> 2672.70]  But, you know,
[2672.78 --> 2673.94]  whichever language you speak,
[2674.02 --> 2674.94]  the name means gazelle.
[2675.96 --> 2677.70]  So she was always doing good
[2677.70 --> 2678.52]  and helping the poor.
[2679.38 --> 2680.42]  About that time,
[2680.54 --> 2681.82]  she became sick and died
[2681.82 --> 2683.06]  and her body was washed
[2683.06 --> 2684.46]  and placed in an upstairs room.
[2686.08 --> 2687.32]  Lydah was near Joppa.
[2687.64 --> 2688.86]  So when the disciples heard
[2688.86 --> 2690.06]  that Peter was in Lydah,
[2690.16 --> 2691.54]  they sent two men to him
[2691.54 --> 2692.52]  and urged him,
[2692.88 --> 2693.76]  please come at once.
[2695.00 --> 2696.14]  Peter went with them
[2696.14 --> 2697.34]  and when he arrived,
[2697.68 --> 2699.42]  he was taken upstairs to the room.
[2700.04 --> 2701.74]  All the widows stood around him,
[2701.90 --> 2702.96]  crying and showing him
[2702.96 --> 2704.38]  the robes and other clothing
[2704.38 --> 2706.04]  that Dorcas had made
[2706.04 --> 2707.42]  while she was still with them.
[2709.12 --> 2711.42]  Peter sent them all out of the room.
[2711.82 --> 2713.22]  Then he got down on his knees
[2713.22 --> 2713.70]  and prayed.
[2714.60 --> 2715.74]  Turning toward the dead woman,
[2715.86 --> 2716.32]  he said,
[2716.94 --> 2717.94]  Tabitha, get up.
[2718.72 --> 2719.98]  She opened her eyes
[2719.98 --> 2721.38]  and seeing Peter,
[2721.86 --> 2722.54]  she sat up.
[2723.68 --> 2725.10]  He took her by the hand
[2725.10 --> 2726.28]  and helped her to her feet.
[2726.84 --> 2728.42]  Then he called for the believers,
[2728.82 --> 2729.96]  especially the widows,
[2730.32 --> 2732.84]  and presented her to them alive.
[2733.54 --> 2735.52]  This became known all over Joppa
[2735.52 --> 2738.54]  and many people believed in the Lord.
[2741.58 --> 2743.36]  So we have this brief description
[2743.36 --> 2745.40]  of Dorcas in verse 36.
[2745.98 --> 2748.28]  It says she was always doing good
[2748.28 --> 2749.80]  in helping the poor.
[2750.52 --> 2751.26]  Isn't that wonderful?
[2752.12 --> 2753.22]  She was always doing good
[2753.22 --> 2753.94]  in helping the poor.
[2754.30 --> 2755.44]  That was her legacy.
[2756.22 --> 2757.80]  When people talked about Dorcas,
[2758.34 --> 2760.86]  they said Dorcas was incredible.
[2761.44 --> 2762.90]  She was always doing good
[2762.90 --> 2763.42]  to everybody.
[2763.42 --> 2765.46]  She was always helping the poor.
[2765.88 --> 2767.10]  That's just who she was.
[2767.18 --> 2767.92]  She was this woman
[2767.92 --> 2769.80]  who was always just helping other people.
[2771.18 --> 2772.54]  She wasn't Saul
[2772.54 --> 2775.42]  doing his extreme,
[2776.42 --> 2776.98]  running about,
[2777.14 --> 2778.44]  preaching to people thing.
[2779.02 --> 2780.44]  She wasn't Barnabas.
[2781.06 --> 2781.88]  She wasn't Peter.
[2782.08 --> 2783.20]  But she was doing the thing
[2783.20 --> 2784.94]  that God had called her to do.
[2785.98 --> 2787.20]  There are a couple of clues
[2787.20 --> 2787.98]  in our text
[2787.98 --> 2788.96]  that give us a window
[2788.96 --> 2790.24]  into who she was.
[2790.42 --> 2790.98]  First,
[2791.56 --> 2793.00]  it says that she cared for people.
[2793.94 --> 2794.54]  And particularly,
[2794.84 --> 2796.38]  we know that she cared for the poor.
[2797.42 --> 2798.28]  But also,
[2798.44 --> 2799.98]  we know that she was probably
[2799.98 --> 2801.40]  a very wealthy woman.
[2801.78 --> 2802.92]  So how do we know that?
[2803.72 --> 2803.98]  Well,
[2804.02 --> 2805.50]  it's because the funeral custom
[2805.50 --> 2806.28]  of that day
[2806.28 --> 2807.78]  is that they didn't have
[2807.78 --> 2808.38]  funeral homes.
[2808.46 --> 2809.42]  So when someone died,
[2809.52 --> 2810.74]  the body was just kind of
[2810.74 --> 2811.92]  laid out in the house.
[2812.34 --> 2813.40]  Right there in the living room.
[2814.36 --> 2815.46]  And here it says
[2815.46 --> 2816.52]  they laid her where?
[2816.52 --> 2819.26]  in the upstairs room.
[2819.94 --> 2821.72]  And only wealthy people
[2821.72 --> 2823.52]  could afford a big house
[2823.52 --> 2824.50]  with an upstairs room.
[2824.96 --> 2825.48]  And apparently,
[2825.62 --> 2826.86]  Dorcas was one of those people.
[2827.20 --> 2828.40]  She was a woman of means.
[2829.50 --> 2830.10]  And also,
[2830.30 --> 2830.48]  you know,
[2830.52 --> 2831.22]  we kind of see that
[2831.22 --> 2833.08]  she has the spare time
[2833.08 --> 2833.78]  and the money
[2833.78 --> 2835.08]  to care for people.
[2835.66 --> 2836.62]  So in many ways,
[2836.68 --> 2838.30]  she's a lot like Lydia,
[2838.48 --> 2839.46]  who we meet later
[2839.46 --> 2840.58]  in Acts chapter 16.
[2841.10 --> 2842.28]  Lydia was the first convert
[2842.28 --> 2843.18]  of Macedonia,
[2843.18 --> 2844.34]  and she was a leader
[2844.34 --> 2845.04]  in the community.
[2845.56 --> 2846.98]  And she had this big house
[2846.98 --> 2848.06]  and the church
[2848.06 --> 2849.34]  met in her house.
[2850.02 --> 2850.86]  And it seems that
[2850.86 --> 2852.78]  this was the kind of person
[2852.78 --> 2854.48]  that Dorcas was.
[2855.00 --> 2855.76]  She was a leader
[2855.76 --> 2856.54]  in the community
[2856.54 --> 2858.92]  and she not only cared
[2858.92 --> 2859.58]  for people,
[2859.94 --> 2860.98]  but she was influential
[2860.98 --> 2862.54]  and she used her money
[2862.54 --> 2863.38]  in her position
[2863.38 --> 2864.50]  to care for the poor.
[2865.58 --> 2867.12]  And there's this one other detail
[2867.12 --> 2868.06]  in verse 39.
[2868.46 --> 2868.70]  It says,
[2868.84 --> 2869.92]  when Peter arrived,
[2870.40 --> 2871.04]  they took him
[2871.04 --> 2871.88]  to the upper room
[2871.88 --> 2872.42]  and it says,
[2872.42 --> 2873.34]  all the widows
[2873.34 --> 2874.58]  showed him
[2874.58 --> 2875.50]  the robes
[2875.50 --> 2876.46]  and the clothes
[2876.46 --> 2878.74]  that Dorcas had made
[2878.74 --> 2880.18]  while she was still with them.
[2881.52 --> 2881.62]  Right?
[2881.92 --> 2882.80]  She, Dorcas,
[2882.90 --> 2884.54]  had made all these clothes.
[2884.80 --> 2886.26]  So she was a wealthy woman
[2886.26 --> 2888.04]  who was not above
[2888.04 --> 2889.28]  doing manual labor.
[2889.80 --> 2890.00]  Right?
[2890.06 --> 2891.26]  She was able to sew
[2891.26 --> 2891.90]  and knit.
[2892.54 --> 2893.76]  And so she was like saying,
[2893.86 --> 2893.98]  you know,
[2894.04 --> 2895.20]  I'm going to use these gifts
[2895.20 --> 2896.22]  that I have
[2896.22 --> 2897.88]  of sewing and knitting
[2897.88 --> 2900.02]  to serve other people
[2900.02 --> 2901.44]  and make these clothes
[2901.44 --> 2902.32]  for these widows.
[2902.42 --> 2903.98]  You know,
[2904.04 --> 2904.84]  in the widows,
[2905.48 --> 2906.52]  these were the poorest
[2906.52 --> 2907.18]  of the poor.
[2907.74 --> 2908.06]  Right?
[2908.12 --> 2909.08]  When their husband died,
[2909.16 --> 2910.70]  they had no financial stability.
[2911.24 --> 2912.94]  They had no social standing.
[2913.58 --> 2914.24]  And so they were
[2914.24 --> 2915.34]  a very marginalized
[2915.34 --> 2918.52]  and powerless people.
[2919.46 --> 2920.90]  And Dorcas cared
[2920.90 --> 2922.36]  for this whole community
[2922.36 --> 2923.02]  of widows.
[2924.30 --> 2925.40]  And so Dorcas,
[2925.52 --> 2926.32]  she was a woman
[2926.32 --> 2927.76]  who embraced
[2927.76 --> 2929.34]  where God had planted her.
[2929.34 --> 2931.86]  And she used her gifts
[2931.86 --> 2933.62]  to serve others
[2933.62 --> 2934.62]  and glorify God.
[2935.62 --> 2936.10]  Right?
[2936.16 --> 2937.10]  She didn't have to
[2937.10 --> 2938.02]  leave her hometown
[2938.02 --> 2938.78]  to do it.
[2939.52 --> 2939.76]  Right?
[2939.80 --> 2940.64]  She didn't have to get
[2940.64 --> 2942.72]  lowered in a basket
[2942.72 --> 2943.74]  through the city walls.
[2944.40 --> 2945.60]  She didn't have to travel
[2945.60 --> 2946.70]  around to other churches
[2946.70 --> 2947.36]  and preach.
[2948.02 --> 2949.14]  She was just doing
[2949.14 --> 2950.56]  what God had called her
[2950.56 --> 2951.06]  to do
[2951.06 --> 2952.06]  right where she was.
[2952.28 --> 2953.42]  And she did it
[2953.42 --> 2954.76]  with great faithfulness.
[2954.76 --> 2955.64]  So much so
[2955.64 --> 2958.70]  that when she died,
[2958.80 --> 2959.78]  the whole city
[2959.78 --> 2961.34]  and the community
[2961.34 --> 2962.28]  was just kind of
[2962.28 --> 2964.00]  so broken up about it.
[2964.50 --> 2965.00]  And that's why
[2965.00 --> 2965.84]  they called Peter
[2965.84 --> 2966.44]  to come
[2966.44 --> 2967.24]  and he was able
[2967.24 --> 2967.84]  to bring her
[2967.84 --> 2968.92]  through God's work
[2968.92 --> 2970.24]  to life again
[2970.24 --> 2971.54]  and give her back
[2971.54 --> 2972.30]  to the community.
[2974.06 --> 2974.92]  Okay, so that's Dorcas.
[2975.62 --> 2976.94]  So now let's conclude.
[2978.06 --> 2978.88]  We've looked at
[2978.88 --> 2979.80]  these four characters.
[2981.04 --> 2981.44]  Saul,
[2982.06 --> 2982.80]  the adventurous
[2982.80 --> 2983.60]  James Bond
[2983.60 --> 2984.48]  missionary guy.
[2984.76 --> 2985.52]  who was called
[2985.52 --> 2986.78]  to suffer for the gospel.
[2988.20 --> 2988.68]  Barnabas,
[2988.76 --> 2989.82]  the encourager
[2989.82 --> 2990.70]  and advocate
[2990.70 --> 2993.68]  who worked for others
[2993.68 --> 2994.86]  behind the scenes
[2994.86 --> 2996.06]  to enable the gospel
[2996.06 --> 2996.82]  to advance.
[2997.54 --> 2998.54]  Then we saw Peter,
[2998.70 --> 2999.28]  the pastor
[2999.28 --> 3000.08]  whom God called
[3000.08 --> 3001.36]  to shepherd his sheep.
[3002.48 --> 3002.98]  And Dorcas,
[3003.10 --> 3003.52]  the leader
[3003.52 --> 3004.44]  in her community
[3004.44 --> 3005.56]  who used her wealth
[3005.56 --> 3005.96]  and gifts
[3005.96 --> 3007.02]  to care for people
[3007.02 --> 3008.58]  and the vulnerable.
[3010.42 --> 3011.30]  So now friends,
[3011.38 --> 3011.96]  how do we apply
[3011.96 --> 3012.76]  this to our lives?
[3014.76 --> 3016.12]  I think what is true
[3016.12 --> 3017.24]  of everybody here
[3017.24 --> 3019.84]  is that when we see
[3019.84 --> 3020.88]  somebody else
[3020.88 --> 3022.70]  doing something cool,
[3023.30 --> 3024.88]  doing something great,
[3024.88 --> 3026.64]  we say to ourselves,
[3026.98 --> 3028.82]  why can't I be doing that?
[3029.92 --> 3030.18]  Right?
[3030.30 --> 3031.68]  And just so you know,
[3031.82 --> 3032.80]  pastors do this
[3032.80 --> 3033.52]  all the time.
[3034.08 --> 3034.36]  Right?
[3035.08 --> 3036.14]  Maybe some pastors
[3036.14 --> 3036.82]  will get together
[3036.82 --> 3037.92]  and we'll be sharing
[3037.92 --> 3038.98]  about our ministry
[3038.98 --> 3040.28]  and what we're doing.
[3040.28 --> 3041.94]  and kind of this
[3041.94 --> 3043.68]  jealousy
[3043.68 --> 3045.28]  kind of arises
[3045.28 --> 3046.80]  in our hearts
[3046.80 --> 3048.30]  and we may think
[3048.30 --> 3049.10]  things like we wouldn't
[3049.10 --> 3049.42]  say it,
[3049.46 --> 3050.30]  but we might think,
[3050.46 --> 3052.20]  how come that pastor
[3052.20 --> 3052.92]  gets to do that
[3052.92 --> 3053.62]  kind of ministry?
[3053.94 --> 3054.82]  And I have to do
[3054.82 --> 3055.72]  this kind of ministry.
[3057.36 --> 3057.60]  You know,
[3057.70 --> 3058.90]  but it's not just pastors.
[3059.04 --> 3060.36]  I think all of us
[3060.36 --> 3061.88]  face this.
[3062.16 --> 3063.52]  It applies to all of us.
[3063.70 --> 3064.60]  And think about parents.
[3064.78 --> 3064.88]  You know,
[3064.96 --> 3066.70]  maybe they're talking
[3066.70 --> 3067.76]  with other parents
[3067.76 --> 3069.08]  and they're hanging out
[3069.08 --> 3070.02]  and they're kind of
[3070.02 --> 3071.18]  sharing about their kids.
[3072.34 --> 3073.34]  And you might end up
[3073.34 --> 3073.62]  thinking,
[3073.74 --> 3073.88]  you know,
[3073.92 --> 3075.08]  I wish my kid did
[3075.08 --> 3076.00]  something like that.
[3077.10 --> 3078.28]  Or you're looking
[3078.28 --> 3078.86]  on Instagram
[3078.86 --> 3079.62]  and you're looking
[3079.62 --> 3080.30]  at your friends
[3080.30 --> 3081.50]  and you think,
[3081.62 --> 3082.70]  why can't my life
[3082.70 --> 3085.30]  be more like that person's?
[3085.94 --> 3087.50]  And so we all get trapped
[3087.50 --> 3088.64]  into wanting to live
[3088.64 --> 3090.06]  other people's stories.
[3091.70 --> 3093.12]  But remember the question
[3093.12 --> 3094.18]  we asked at the start.
[3095.04 --> 3096.08]  What is the life
[3096.08 --> 3097.40]  that God has given me?
[3098.76 --> 3099.86]  And again,
[3100.72 --> 3101.70]  that question
[3101.70 --> 3102.66]  frees us
[3102.66 --> 3103.40]  from the burden
[3103.40 --> 3105.34]  of having to create
[3105.34 --> 3106.20]  our own lives.
[3106.60 --> 3107.68]  It gives us the freedom
[3107.68 --> 3108.38]  to just be
[3108.38 --> 3110.28]  who God has created us to be.
[3111.28 --> 3112.62]  And I heard a quote
[3112.62 --> 3113.46]  this week
[3113.46 --> 3115.02]  on a podcast
[3115.02 --> 3115.70]  and it's a bit
[3115.70 --> 3116.80]  of an odd quote
[3116.80 --> 3118.48]  for church
[3118.48 --> 3119.80]  but it's from Oscar Wilde.
[3120.16 --> 3121.16]  And he said this,
[3121.72 --> 3122.52]  be yourself,
[3123.34 --> 3124.00]  everyone else
[3124.00 --> 3124.72]  has already taken.
[3125.88 --> 3126.64]  It's great.
[3127.76 --> 3128.78]  I think that's something
[3128.78 --> 3129.66]  to think about.
[3130.12 --> 3130.70]  Be yourself.
[3130.84 --> 3131.28]  Everyone else
[3131.28 --> 3131.88]  has already taken.
[3133.32 --> 3134.62]  And the thing that happens
[3134.62 --> 3135.56]  when we begin
[3135.56 --> 3136.72]  to embrace that,
[3136.86 --> 3137.86]  to be ourselves,
[3137.96 --> 3138.68]  the person who God
[3138.68 --> 3139.42]  made us to be
[3139.42 --> 3141.06]  and to live faithfully
[3141.06 --> 3141.96]  to the life
[3141.96 --> 3143.08]  that God has given us
[3143.08 --> 3143.94]  is we see
[3143.94 --> 3144.80]  how powerfully
[3144.80 --> 3146.18]  God works
[3146.18 --> 3147.18]  when we do that.
[3148.22 --> 3149.26]  And we see that
[3149.26 --> 3150.26]  in this text as well.
[3150.60 --> 3151.34]  There's one verse
[3151.34 --> 3152.80]  I intentionally skipped over
[3152.80 --> 3153.50]  and didn't read.
[3154.12 --> 3155.40]  It's this summary statement
[3155.40 --> 3156.30]  in verse 31.
[3157.18 --> 3158.20]  This is what it says.
[3158.20 --> 3159.36]  When the church
[3159.36 --> 3160.46]  throughout Judea,
[3160.66 --> 3161.44]  Galilee,
[3161.56 --> 3162.18]  and Samaria
[3162.18 --> 3165.08]  enjoyed a time of peace
[3165.08 --> 3165.96]  and was strengthened,
[3166.50 --> 3167.30]  living in the fear
[3167.30 --> 3167.84]  of the Lord
[3167.84 --> 3168.60]  and encouraged
[3168.60 --> 3169.56]  by the Holy Spirit,
[3170.06 --> 3171.06]  it increased in numbers.
[3172.26 --> 3172.70]  Right?
[3172.80 --> 3174.04]  And that is a beautiful thing.
[3175.16 --> 3176.02]  The church,
[3176.16 --> 3176.40]  it says,
[3176.48 --> 3177.22]  has peace.
[3177.80 --> 3178.50]  And the church
[3178.50 --> 3179.16]  is growing
[3179.16 --> 3180.18]  and being built up
[3180.18 --> 3180.84]  and strengthened.
[3181.52 --> 3182.54]  And God is working
[3182.54 --> 3183.26]  powerfully
[3183.26 --> 3184.40]  through his people
[3184.40 --> 3186.54]  when we live faithfully.
[3187.54 --> 3188.80]  And when God's kingdom
[3188.80 --> 3189.68]  moves forward,
[3189.96 --> 3191.20]  it's God's work,
[3191.28 --> 3191.50]  right?
[3192.06 --> 3193.02]  But oftentimes,
[3193.46 --> 3194.56]  it moves forward
[3194.56 --> 3196.30]  through our faithfulness
[3196.30 --> 3197.78]  to be the people
[3197.78 --> 3198.70]  and live the lives
[3198.70 --> 3200.16]  that God has called us
[3200.16 --> 3200.98]  to live.
[3203.02 --> 3204.30]  Here's a last thought
[3204.30 --> 3205.36]  I want to share with you.
[3206.90 --> 3208.24]  The reason we're able
[3208.24 --> 3209.24]  to know God
[3209.24 --> 3211.56]  the reason we are able
[3211.56 --> 3213.00]  to have this freedom
[3213.00 --> 3213.94]  to live the life
[3213.94 --> 3214.94]  that he has given us
[3214.94 --> 3216.72]  is because Jesus
[3216.72 --> 3218.34]  lived faithfully
[3218.34 --> 3219.20]  the life that God
[3219.20 --> 3219.88]  had given him.
[3221.24 --> 3221.48]  Right?
[3221.64 --> 3223.04]  In Peter's sermon
[3223.04 --> 3223.70]  to the crowds
[3223.70 --> 3224.36]  in Pentecost
[3224.36 --> 3225.30]  in Acts chapter 2,
[3225.44 --> 3226.06]  Peter says,
[3226.58 --> 3226.80]  Jesus,
[3227.02 --> 3228.40]  this man was handed over
[3228.40 --> 3229.14]  to you
[3229.14 --> 3231.46]  by God's deliberate plan
[3231.46 --> 3232.40]  and foreknowledge.
[3232.96 --> 3233.52]  And you,
[3233.66 --> 3234.66]  with the help of wicked men,
[3234.78 --> 3235.66]  put him to death
[3235.66 --> 3236.94]  by nailing him
[3236.94 --> 3237.58]  on the cross.
[3238.26 --> 3238.56]  Right?
[3238.56 --> 3239.70]  What was God's plan
[3239.70 --> 3240.78]  for Jesus' life?
[3242.66 --> 3244.36]  God's deliberate plan
[3244.36 --> 3244.90]  for Jesus
[3244.90 --> 3245.82]  was not only
[3245.82 --> 3246.56]  to suffer
[3246.56 --> 3247.76]  like Saul,
[3248.20 --> 3248.90]  but to die.
[3249.88 --> 3250.54]  In Jesus,
[3251.06 --> 3252.46]  he embraced
[3252.46 --> 3253.28]  the life
[3253.28 --> 3254.06]  that his father
[3254.06 --> 3254.84]  had given him.
[3255.58 --> 3256.36]  Jesus said
[3256.36 --> 3257.86]  in John,
[3258.12 --> 3259.32]  for I have come
[3259.32 --> 3260.12]  down from heaven
[3260.12 --> 3261.46]  not to do my will,
[3261.90 --> 3263.42]  but to do the will
[3263.42 --> 3264.72]  of him who sent me.
[3264.72 --> 3266.26]  So then,
[3266.32 --> 3266.84]  what was
[3266.84 --> 3267.94]  the father's will
[3267.94 --> 3268.52]  for Jesus?
[3269.26 --> 3270.00]  Jesus continues
[3270.00 --> 3270.64]  and says,
[3270.98 --> 3271.88]  and this is the will
[3271.88 --> 3272.74]  of him who sent me,
[3273.02 --> 3274.34]  that I should lose none
[3274.34 --> 3275.30]  of all those
[3275.30 --> 3276.30]  he has given me,
[3276.58 --> 3277.74]  but raise them up
[3277.74 --> 3279.04]  on the last day.
[3280.30 --> 3281.56]  Jesus embraced
[3281.56 --> 3282.74]  his life
[3282.74 --> 3283.56]  from God
[3283.56 --> 3285.34]  so that God
[3285.34 --> 3287.22]  could embrace us
[3287.22 --> 3288.58]  and to raise us up
[3288.58 --> 3289.98]  and that we could
[3289.98 --> 3290.92]  become his.
[3290.92 --> 3293.40]  and now we have
[3293.40 --> 3294.36]  received that life.
[3294.84 --> 3295.68]  We don't have to
[3295.68 --> 3296.74]  create ourselves,
[3296.88 --> 3297.34]  we don't have to
[3297.34 --> 3298.38]  invent ourselves.
[3299.30 --> 3300.20]  This life has been
[3300.20 --> 3301.16]  given to us
[3301.16 --> 3302.26]  and in response,
[3303.00 --> 3303.72]  what does it mean
[3303.72 --> 3304.56]  to live faithfully?
[3304.66 --> 3305.50]  But we embrace
[3305.50 --> 3306.24]  the life that God
[3306.24 --> 3306.96]  has given us
[3306.96 --> 3309.12]  and we trust
[3309.12 --> 3309.84]  that God is going
[3309.84 --> 3311.52]  to work in our lives
[3311.52 --> 3312.72]  for his purpose
[3312.72 --> 3313.44]  and his mission
[3313.44 --> 3315.52]  wherever he plants us.
[3316.38 --> 3316.52]  Okay,
[3316.56 --> 3317.32]  so let's pray together.
[3317.32 --> 3320.88]  Father,
[3321.02 --> 3321.50]  we thank you
[3321.50 --> 3322.64]  for this passage.
[3322.78 --> 3323.38]  It just has all
[3323.38 --> 3324.98]  of these people
[3324.98 --> 3325.94]  that we see
[3325.94 --> 3327.34]  living faithfully
[3327.34 --> 3327.86]  the lives
[3327.86 --> 3328.96]  that you have
[3328.96 --> 3329.46]  given them.
[3330.30 --> 3331.60]  They're all different,
[3332.72 --> 3333.90]  but Lord,
[3334.02 --> 3334.82]  each one of them
[3334.82 --> 3335.28]  is faithful
[3335.28 --> 3335.88]  to that life
[3335.88 --> 3336.22]  and Lord,
[3336.32 --> 3337.02]  so much for us
[3337.02 --> 3337.60]  we struggle
[3337.60 --> 3338.94]  with wanting
[3338.94 --> 3340.34]  a different life,
[3341.12 --> 3341.84]  not wanting
[3341.84 --> 3342.58]  a life maybe
[3342.58 --> 3343.16]  of suffering
[3343.16 --> 3344.02]  that you have
[3344.02 --> 3344.62]  given us,
[3345.48 --> 3346.68]  maybe wanting
[3346.68 --> 3347.78]  to have more status
[3347.78 --> 3348.72]  or influence
[3348.72 --> 3350.28]  than you have
[3350.28 --> 3350.92]  given us,
[3351.80 --> 3352.46]  but Lord,
[3352.58 --> 3353.70]  we see what happens
[3353.70 --> 3354.98]  when you help us
[3354.98 --> 3355.60]  to be faithful
[3355.60 --> 3356.44]  to the life
[3356.44 --> 3357.08]  that you have
[3357.08 --> 3357.88]  given us to lead
[3357.88 --> 3359.12]  and Lord,
[3359.24 --> 3359.80]  we ask that you
[3359.80 --> 3360.36]  would help us
[3360.36 --> 3362.44]  to know ourselves,
[3362.58 --> 3363.52]  know the personality
[3363.52 --> 3364.18]  and the role
[3364.18 --> 3366.48]  that you have
[3366.48 --> 3367.58]  graced us with,
[3367.64 --> 3368.18]  our gifts,
[3368.32 --> 3369.00]  our strengths
[3369.00 --> 3370.32]  and Lord,
[3370.40 --> 3371.16]  that you would help us
[3371.16 --> 3372.48]  to live that out
[3372.48 --> 3373.56]  for your glory
[3373.56 --> 3374.66]  and your good
[3374.66 --> 3375.30]  and the good
[3375.30 --> 3376.20]  of all those
[3376.20 --> 3376.76]  around us.
[3377.38 --> 3377.60]  Lord,
[3377.64 --> 3378.42]  we pray for your help
[3378.42 --> 3379.32]  with the Holy Spirit
[3379.32 --> 3381.70]  in Christ's name
[3381.70 --> 3382.10]  we pray.
[3382.66 --> 3382.90]  Amen.
[3384.52 --> 3385.06]  All right,
[3385.18 --> 3386.04]  let's stand
[3386.04 --> 3387.34]  and let's sing
[3387.34 --> 3388.08]  our song of response.
[3388.08 --> 3388.22]  Amen.
[3388.22 --> 3388.28]  Amen.
[3388.28 --> 3388.34]  Amen.
[3388.34 --> 3388.42]  Amen.
[3388.42 --> 3388.48]  Amen.
[3388.48 --> 3388.52]  Amen.
[3388.52 --> 3388.58]  Amen.
[3388.58 --> 3388.62]  Amen.
[3388.62 --> 3388.68]  Amen.
[3388.68 --> 3388.74]  Amen.
[3388.74 --> 3388.84]  Amen.
[3388.84 --> 3388.92]  Amen.
[3405.30 --> 3406.20]  taunt
[3406.20 --> 3417.58]  Amen.
[3417.58 --> 3421.32]  Spirit, giving breath of blood,
[3421.74 --> 3426.98]  bring you life into my willing soul.
[3429.02 --> 3434.42]  Bring the presence of the risen Lord
[3434.42 --> 3440.24]  to renew my heart and make me whole.
[3440.24 --> 3448.10]  Cause your word to come alive in me.
[3448.58 --> 3454.18]  Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[3454.18 --> 3459.96]  Give me passion for your purity.
[3460.52 --> 3466.14]  Holy Spirit, reveal life in me.
[3470.24 --> 3476.46]  Holy Spirit, come up high with me.
[3476.88 --> 3481.84]  May your joy be saved in all I do.
[3483.30 --> 3488.90]  Love enough to cover every sin
[3488.90 --> 3494.54]  in each content in an avid tune.
[3494.54 --> 3502.26]  Thine is to the greatest and the least.
[3503.54 --> 3508.80]  Gentleness that slows the path of peace.
[3508.80 --> 3514.66]  Do not start me into works of grace.
[3515.14 --> 3519.60]  Work of God, show Christ in all I do.
[3519.60 --> 3530.58]  Holy Spirit, come creation's birth,
[3530.58 --> 3536.10]  giving life to all that God has made.
[3537.56 --> 3543.18]  Show your power once again on earth.
[3543.60 --> 3548.60]  Cause your church to move and follow your ways.
[3548.60 --> 3556.58]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
[3556.58 --> 3562.74]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[3562.74 --> 3568.40]  That in unity the face of Christ
[3568.40 --> 3574.12]  may be clear for all the world to see.
[3574.12 --> 3582.68]  You may be seated.
[3582.68 --> 3605.82]  Before we go to our prayer this morning,
[3606.34 --> 3608.10]  there are just a few announcements.
[3608.10 --> 3615.08]  Pastor Henry has been in hospital for some time.
[3616.24 --> 3620.62]  And his condition has been serious,
[3620.84 --> 3623.56]  but he has been somewhat stabilized this week.
[3623.96 --> 3627.66]  But we'll be receiving a second round of chemotherapy this week.
[3627.66 --> 3635.44]  So we will pray that it doesn't take effect the way it did the first time.
[3637.06 --> 3641.72]  Jean had an episode that resulted in hospitalization,
[3642.22 --> 3645.92]  where she will remain for now for some observation and testing.
[3645.92 --> 3652.52]  Also, Mel's sister, Kobe, passed away in Alberta on Friday.
[3652.72 --> 3655.78]  We send our condolences to Mel and the family.
[3657.72 --> 3659.12]  Let's join in prayer,
[3660.48 --> 3664.24]  offering our praise, thanksgiving, and intercession to God.
[3664.24 --> 3670.72]  O God, our provider, our rock, and our refuge,
[3671.68 --> 3673.78]  glorify yourself in all the earth,
[3674.78 --> 3678.88]  in creation, in the church, and yes, in our worship this morning.
[3679.54 --> 3683.52]  As the world wonders at the majesty of the universe,
[3684.32 --> 3685.42]  may it see you,
[3685.92 --> 3688.22]  and may the love of Christ within us
[3688.22 --> 3693.92]  act as a magnifying glass that reveals your justice, mercy, and grace.
[3695.02 --> 3697.28]  We offer you praise and thanksgiving
[3697.28 --> 3700.12]  for your steadfast love that is new every morning.
[3701.24 --> 3703.04]  You cause the sun to rise,
[3703.38 --> 3705.28]  the seasons to unfold in their order,
[3705.54 --> 3709.16]  and you light the night sky with countless constellations.
[3710.06 --> 3714.14]  You send rains that cause seeds to grow into food for all your creatures.
[3714.14 --> 3718.78]  You provide us with physical and spiritual sustenance.
[3719.82 --> 3723.10]  You surround us with love of family and community.
[3724.14 --> 3725.72]  Great is your faithfulness.
[3727.10 --> 3729.98]  Lord, you have been extravagant in your care for us,
[3730.26 --> 3732.70]  but we see injustice and inequity
[3732.70 --> 3734.52]  throughout our country and the world.
[3735.82 --> 3739.48]  We pray that where we hold firmly to the gifts you've given,
[3740.66 --> 3743.46]  you would loosen our grip and make us generous.
[3744.14 --> 3746.76]  Jesus, as you fed the hungry,
[3747.38 --> 3748.88]  grant us your compassion.
[3750.02 --> 3753.38]  We pray for world renew in the Canadian Food Grains Bank
[3753.38 --> 3755.10]  and similar relief agencies.
[3756.12 --> 3759.18]  Thank you for those who minister your mercy to families
[3759.18 --> 3761.46]  who don't know where their next meal is coming from.
[3762.52 --> 3764.88]  Thank you for those whose wise leadership
[3764.88 --> 3768.66]  and tireless campaigning leads to sustainable food supply
[3768.66 --> 3770.06]  and full bellies.
[3770.06 --> 3775.54]  King of Kings, we ask your justice and peace in areas
[3775.54 --> 3779.62]  where there is uprising, violence, and political unrest.
[3781.06 --> 3784.22]  Throughout history, kingdoms have risen and they have fallen.
[3785.30 --> 3787.80]  May we not become anxious over these things,
[3787.94 --> 3790.08]  but be assured that you are still on the throne,
[3790.24 --> 3791.66]  bringing history to fulfillment.
[3791.66 --> 3795.94]  grant humility and wisdom to our country's leaders
[3795.94 --> 3797.58]  and their advisors.
[3797.58 --> 3802.32]  We pray for victims of violence and especially remember
[3802.32 --> 3805.76]  the families of those who were attacked last night in Quebec.
[3806.96 --> 3811.52]  Lord, we ask that you would end this kind of violence,
[3811.90 --> 3814.50]  that peace would reign instead.
[3814.50 --> 3819.18]  Lord, even as the COVID pandemic seems to worsen,
[3819.34 --> 3821.94]  we ask for your divine intervention of this virus.
[3822.74 --> 3825.72]  Thank you for medical teams, researchers, and support people.
[3826.72 --> 3828.74]  Loving Savior, you know better than we do
[3828.74 --> 3831.06]  those who feel lonely and anxious
[3831.06 --> 3833.72]  and those who have lost loved ones to this pandemic.
[3834.76 --> 3837.12]  Show us ways to come alongside them.
[3838.80 --> 3840.30]  God of healing and comfort,
[3840.44 --> 3843.42]  we bring to you those we know and love who are sick.
[3843.42 --> 3847.26]  We think of Jean and pray that the test done
[3847.26 --> 3851.06]  will help with diagnosis and treatment.
[3852.12 --> 3854.64]  Be near to her and we pray for a full recovery.
[3855.96 --> 3859.34]  We have heard that Pastor Henry's condition is serious.
[3860.28 --> 3863.56]  And we also know that Kim, Kathy, Joan, and Tim
[3863.56 --> 3868.18]  suffer with extreme fatigue and pain that cancer brings.
[3869.34 --> 3872.54]  May these, your dear children, know without a doubt
[3872.54 --> 3875.88]  that you are present even and especially
[3875.88 --> 3879.30]  in their darkness and deepest need.
[3880.82 --> 3883.40]  We ask the same for all those who struggle
[3883.40 --> 3887.28]  with various kinds of pain, illness, and loss.
[3888.44 --> 3890.50]  Grace their loved ones a special measure
[3890.50 --> 3893.58]  of patience, compassion, and comfort.
[3893.58 --> 3908.30]  Lord, would you give them comfort and also for the whole family.
[3909.98 --> 3912.88]  And be with Shirley as she recuperates from eye surgery.
[3914.08 --> 3916.92]  Gracious Father, give this couple what they stand in need of
[3916.92 --> 3918.72]  during grief and uncertainty.
[3918.72 --> 3921.84]  Through all these trials, Lord,
[3922.44 --> 3925.68]  strengthen our faith and unity as your church here.
[3927.14 --> 3929.38]  As we near the end of this worship service,
[3929.88 --> 3931.66]  we long for the coming of your kingdom.
[3932.94 --> 3935.90]  May your church be faithful to her calling right here
[3935.90 --> 3938.16]  and also around the globe.
[3938.16 --> 3942.84]  As you equipped your early church, Holy Spirit,
[3943.40 --> 3948.34]  work within us ways that radiates surprising delight and joy.
[3949.46 --> 3952.96]  Thank you for your word and ways in which you make it clear to us
[3952.96 --> 3956.76]  through reading, study, and Pastor Jason's gifts.
[3957.80 --> 3960.94]  Will you encourage him, Pastor Nancy, and all of us
[3960.94 --> 3965.32]  as we seek to be your disciples in this time and in this place.
[3965.32 --> 3969.00]  Redeeming God, we love and adore you
[3969.00 --> 3971.16]  and we lay our lives before you.
[3972.12 --> 3974.82]  Remind us always that you are the good warrior
[3974.82 --> 3976.46]  who fights for us.
[3977.42 --> 3978.80]  Come quickly, Lord Jesus,
[3979.64 --> 3981.46]  in whose powerful name we pray.
[3982.32 --> 3982.64]  Amen.
[3993.20 --> 3994.42]  So I invite you to stand.
[3995.32 --> 3998.74]  And whether you are here or those at home,
[3999.12 --> 4002.32]  we go out with the Lord's calling upon us
[4002.32 --> 4003.92]  and his blessing over us.
[4004.40 --> 4006.12]  So I invite you to hold out your hands
[4006.12 --> 4007.86]  to receive the blessing of your Heavenly Father.
[4009.14 --> 4010.76]  Now may the God of peace,
[4010.80 --> 4013.18]  who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,
[4013.38 --> 4014.74]  the great shepherd of the sheep,
[4015.34 --> 4017.06]  by the blood of the eternal covenant,
[4017.72 --> 4019.38]  equip you with everything good
[4019.38 --> 4021.26]  that you may do his will,
[4021.26 --> 4024.68]  working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[4024.68 --> 4026.22]  through Jesus Christ,
[4026.30 --> 4028.04]  to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4028.26 --> 4029.06]  Amen.
[4029.06 --> 4032.44]  Let's remain standing and sing our final song.
[4032.44 --> 4049.16]  We will glorify the King of kings,
[4049.24 --> 4053.44]  we will glorify the Lamb,
[4053.44 --> 4063.44]  who is the great I am.
[4063.44 --> 4064.44]  He is Lord of all who live in the Lord.
[4064.44 --> 4068.44]  He is Lord of all who live in the Lord.
[4068.44 --> 4069.36]  We will glorify the Lord.
[4069.36 --> 4074.08]  We will bow in all His joy
[4074.08 --> 4079.04]  We will worship Him in righteousness
[4079.04 --> 4083.92]  We will worship Him alone
[4083.92 --> 4089.30]  He is Lord of the Lord, Lord of the Lord
[4089.30 --> 4093.78]  He is Lord of all who live
[4093.78 --> 4099.00]  He is Lord of the Lord, Lord of the universe
[4099.00 --> 4103.76]  All praise Him in the name
[4103.76 --> 4108.94]  Hallelujah to the King of Peace
[4108.94 --> 4113.44]  Hallelujah to the Lamb
[4113.44 --> 4118.86]  Hallelujah to the Lord of Once
[4118.86 --> 4124.04]  Who is the Great I Am
[4129.00 --> 4132.34]  Amen
[4144.34 --> 4144.68]  Amen
