[0.00 → 3.38] So we'll look forward to maybe seeing them at some point in the future.
[7.88 → 12.02] God greets us this morning and calls us to worship him with these words.
[13.36 → 16.72] People of God, worship the living God today.
[18.02 → 22.20] Remember that out of nothing God created the heavens and earth.
[23.34 → 27.24] Remember that God raised Jesus from the powerlessness of death
[27.24 → 29.60] to the power of his right hand.
[30.58 → 35.08] Remember that not even the gates of hell can stand against God's purposes.
[36.18 → 39.76] Behold your God who reigns now and forever.
[41.28 → 46.24] It's a good time at this moment to maybe stand and try to greet those around you,
[46.28 → 46.90] maybe with a wave.
[46.98 → 50.06] Obviously we can't shake hands if you're close enough to do an elbow bump,
[50.06 → 53.18] but generally just do a wave and acknowledge us, each other.
[53.76 → 56.76] And directly after that, our worship team will lead us in time of praise.
[60.00 → 65.80] And that's a good time for us.
[65.88 → 66.84] Thank you.
[66.84 → 67.84] Amen.
[96.84 → 102.78] My Saviour, Lord, there is none like you.
[102.78 → 114.72] All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[116.92 → 125.94] My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength.
[125.94 → 137.72] Let every breath, oh God I am, never cease to worship you.
[139.08 → 144.38] Shout to the Lord on the earth that I see.
[145.10 → 150.26] Power and majesty, praise to the King.
[150.26 → 156.00] Mountains bow down, and the seas will roar.
[156.50 → 161.70] How the sound of your name.
[163.04 → 168.06] I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[168.70 → 174.02] Forever I love you, forever I stand.
[174.02 → 182.02] Nothing compares to the promises of opinion.
[182.02 → 196.02] My Jesus, my Saviour, Lord, there is none like you.
[196.02 → 209.06] All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[209.06 → 220.06] My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength.
[220.06 → 232.06] Let every breath, oh God I am, never cease to worship you.
[232.06 → 239.06] Shout to the Lord on the earth that I see.
[239.06 → 241.06] God bless you, Lord, there is none like you.
[241.06 → 251.24] I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[251.24 → 253.24] Forever I love you, forever I stand.
[253.24 → 258.24] I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[258.24 → 263.36] I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[263.36 → 269.48] Forever I love you, forever I stand.
[269.48 → 270.26] requests are all yours, forever I stand.
[270.26 → 274.12] Everything compares to the promises of opinion.
[274.12 → 276.26] Everything compares to the promises of opinion,
[276.26 → 278.66] simply metro ما indeed.
[278.66 → 304.66] piano plays softly
[304.66 → 307.66] Blessed be your name
[307.66 → 311.66] In the land that is plentiful
[311.66 → 315.66] Where streams of abundance flow
[315.66 → 321.66] Blessed be your name
[321.66 → 324.66] Blessed be your name
[324.66 → 328.66] When I'm found in the desert place
[328.66 → 332.66] Though I walk through their wilderness
[332.66 → 338.66] Blessed be your name
[338.66 → 341.66] Every blessing you pour out
[341.66 → 346.66] Turned down to praise
[346.66 → 350.66] When the darkness closes in one
[350.66 → 353.66] Still will we say
[353.66 → 357.66] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[357.66 → 361.66] Blessed be your name
[361.66 → 365.66] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[365.66 → 370.66] Blessed be your glorious name
[370.66 → 376.66] Blessed be your name
[376.66 → 380.66] When the sun's shining down on me
[380.66 → 384.66] When the world's all as it should be
[384.66 → 387.66] Blessed be your name
[387.66 → 389.66] Blessed be your name
[389.66 → 391.66] Blessed be your name
[391.66 → 393.66] Blessed be your name
[393.66 → 397.66] On the road marked with suffering
[397.66 → 400.66] God bless you
[400.66 → 403.66] For the blessing of the Lord
[403.66 → 406.66] Blessed be your glory
[406.66 → 408.66] For the blessing of the Lord
[408.66 → 409.66] Blessed be your glory
[409.66 → 410.66] For the blessing of the Lord
[410.66 → 415.52] Turn back to place
[415.52 → 420.22] When the darkness closes in, Lord
[420.22 → 423.00] Still in love with sin
[423.00 → 427.12] Let it be the name of the Lord
[427.12 → 430.60] Let it be your name
[430.60 → 435.48] Let it be the name of the Lord
[435.48 → 440.16] Let it be your glorious name
[440.16 → 448.16] You give and take away
[448.16 → 451.98] You give and take away
[451.98 → 456.70] My heart will choose to sing
[456.70 → 460.82] Lord, blessed be your name
[460.82 → 464.58] You give and take away
[464.58 → 468.42] You give and take away
[468.42 → 472.42] My heart will choose to sing
[472.42 → 476.42] Lord, blessed be your name
[476.42 → 480.24] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[480.24 → 484.24] Blessed be your name
[484.24 → 490.22] Blessed be your name
[490.24 → 492.24] Blessed be your name
[492.24 → 496.06] Blessed be your name
[496.06 → 506.62] ah
[526.06 → 547.76] My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine.
[547.76 → 558.20] For Thee, all the flies of sin, I resign.
[558.86 → 568.76] My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou.
[568.76 → 579.44] If I ever love Thee, my Jesus, this now.
[580.72 → 590.76] I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me.
[590.76 → 601.68] And purchased my body on Calvary's stream.
[602.40 → 611.76] I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow.
[611.76 → 623.04] If I ever love Thee, my Jesus, this now.
[624.18 → 633.76] I love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death.
[633.76 → 645.04] And praise Thee as long as Thou lewdest me breath.
[645.90 → 655.84] And say when I tend to my scold on my brow.
[655.84 → 666.18] If I ever love Thee, my Jesus, this now.
[666.18 → 677.96] In mansions of glory and endless delight,
[677.96 → 688.74] I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright.
[688.74 → 699.74] I'll sing in the winter, I'll roll on my brow.
[699.74 → 711.40] If I ever love Thee, my Jesus, this now.
[711.40 → 724.12] If I ever love Thee, my Jesus, this now.
[726.50 → 727.66] You may be seated.
[733.22 → 736.24] I have to say it is wonderful having you guys sing with us.
[737.24 → 739.78] I'm going to read before the sermon Psalm 91.
[741.40 → 745.20] He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
[745.20 → 747.50] will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[748.02 → 749.38] I will say of the Lord,
[749.68 → 751.80] He is my refuge and my fortress,
[752.30 → 754.06] my God in whom I trust.
[754.82 → 757.20] Surely He will save you from the fowler's snare
[757.20 → 759.54] and from the deadly pestilence.
[760.02 → 761.70] He will cover you with His feathers,
[762.04 → 764.42] and under His wings you will find refuge.
[765.16 → 767.64] His faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
[768.14 → 770.22] You will not fear the terror of the night
[770.22 → 772.10] nor the arrow that flies by day,
[772.44 → 774.88] nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,
[775.24 → 777.62] nor the plague that destroys at midday.
[778.64 → 780.98] A thousand may fell at your side,
[781.36 → 783.06] ten thousand at your right hand,
[783.38 → 784.84] but it will not come near you.
[785.22 → 787.08] You will only observe with your eyes
[787.08 → 788.86] and see the punishment of the wicked.
[788.86 → 792.48] If you make the Most High you're dwelling,
[792.84 → 794.72] even the Lord who is my refuge,
[794.96 → 796.64] then no harm will befall you.
[797.28 → 799.38] No disaster will come near your tent,
[799.80 → 802.28] for He will command His angels concerning you
[802.28 → 804.40] to guard you in all your ways.
[804.98 → 806.76] They will lift you up in their hands
[806.76 → 809.20] so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
[809.88 → 812.22] You will tread upon the lion and the cobra.
[812.74 → 814.84] You will trample the great lion and the serpent.
[814.84 → 817.48] Because He loves me, says the Lord,
[817.64 → 818.76] I will rescue Him.
[819.08 → 820.34] I will protect Him,
[820.74 → 822.18] for He acknowledges my name.
[823.26 → 824.50] He will call upon me,
[824.56 → 826.02] and I will answer Him.
[826.20 → 827.60] I will be with Him in trouble.
[828.08 → 829.86] I will deliver Him and honour Him.
[830.34 → 832.36] With long life will I satisfy Him
[832.36 → 833.82] and show Him my salvation.
[834.56 → 835.80] This is the word of the Lord.
[835.80 → 835.90] Amen.
[835.90 → 835.94] Amen.
[835.94 → 835.98] Amen.
[835.98 → 836.06] Amen.
[836.06 → 836.10] Amen.
[836.10 → 836.14] Amen.
[836.14 → 836.18] Amen.
[836.18 → 837.98] Amen.
[837.98 → 838.02] Amen.
[838.02 → 840.02] Amen.
[840.02 → 840.06] Amen.
[840.06 → 840.10] Amen.
[844.84 → 845.88] Good morning, everyone.
[847.36 → 848.46] My name is Albert.
[848.70 → 851.22] I'm the lead pastor of the Tapestry Church Network
[851.22 → 853.74] and delighted to be with you this morning.
[853.96 → 856.66] The first time I spoke here was actually in 2004.
[857.28 → 858.76] So that was 16 years ago.
[858.92 → 860.70] And so I've been coming in and out,
[860.76 → 862.56] and I know a lot of my staff have been here
[862.56 → 864.00] in the last little while.
[864.12 → 866.04] And so I get the pleasure of being here again.
[866.04 → 867.46] I was actually here in September.
[868.10 → 869.84] And so I'm starting to make a routine of it.
[870.16 → 871.74] And it's great to be here.
[871.74 → 875.80] So I'd like to respond by the first slide on the screen.
[876.30 → 879.58] And what's going to happen is I'm going to ask you to read in the bold.
[879.72 → 883.62] So whether you're reading here or you're Samuel Mass in the fireside room
[883.62 → 885.54] and you're speaking in a different language
[885.54 → 887.24] or whether you're watching from home,
[887.46 → 888.98] I would like you to read the bold.
[889.12 → 891.24] So basically I'm going to say God is good
[891.24 → 893.40] and you're going to respond with all the time.
[893.60 → 895.30] Then I'm going to say all the time
[895.30 → 897.46] and you're going to respond with God is good.
[897.54 → 898.26] Okay, you got it?
[898.70 → 899.66] Okay, let's try this.
[900.24 → 900.98] God is good.
[900.98 → 901.10] God is good.
[901.56 → 902.60] All the time.
[902.76 → 903.50] All the time.
[904.00 → 904.90] God is good.
[905.00 → 906.26] Okay, that's pretty good,
[906.32 → 907.90] but we're going to work on that a little, okay?
[908.30 → 910.08] Like, say it like you mean it.
[910.28 → 911.24] With some conviction.
[911.68 → 912.32] With some oomph.
[912.52 → 913.98] Especially at home, okay?
[914.02 → 915.76] If you're watching at home, you can do this.
[915.92 → 916.10] Ready?
[916.76 → 917.72] God is good.
[918.24 → 919.26] All the time.
[919.38 → 920.18] All the time.
[920.58 → 921.52] God is good.
[921.62 → 922.04] Excellent.
[922.70 → 924.28] Now this call and response,
[924.46 → 925.40] affirmation of faith,
[925.46 → 928.64] is well-used in the African American church tradition
[928.64 → 930.56] and one in which we're going to use.
[930.64 → 933.66] I'm going to ask you to repeat from time to time today,
[933.84 → 935.62] this morning during my sermon.
[936.18 → 939.02] Because we can declare that God is good.
[939.12 → 940.82] He is good all the time.
[941.32 → 944.66] Yes, even in these strange and unprecedented times
[944.66 → 946.22] that we find ourselves today.
[946.64 → 948.44] That in our present circumstances,
[948.70 → 950.46] in good times and in bad,
[950.70 → 952.08] through ups and downs,
[952.08 → 953.66] at home in the promised land
[953.66 → 955.42] or in danger in the wilderness,
[956.08 → 958.60] we can proclaim that God is good.
[959.24 → 960.18] All the time.
[960.52 → 961.32] All the time.
[961.84 → 962.44] All the time.
[962.44 → 963.84] Ah, so you're getting the hang of it.
[963.92 → 964.46] This is great.
[965.20 → 966.54] Now speaking of wilderness,
[967.18 → 968.58] I actually love the wilderness,
[968.84 → 970.88] or at least geographical wilderness.
[971.38 → 972.72] That I've been telling a lot of people
[972.72 → 973.92] that during this pandemic,
[974.36 → 976.20] because you can't travel internationally,
[976.82 → 979.96] BC is not a bad place to be stuck in, right?
[979.96 → 982.56] I mean, I've been able to go to places in BC
[982.56 → 983.42] I've never been.
[983.92 → 986.32] To the Kootenay's and Nelson and Soho,
[986.44 → 987.18] and don't tell anyone,
[987.30 → 988.20] but I've been to the Okanagan
[988.20 → 989.74] four different times this year already.
[990.60 → 992.46] And one of the things I love doing
[992.46 → 995.24] is going on these long day hikes
[995.24 → 996.62] and backpacking trips.
[997.08 → 999.50] And my favourite two pictures this year thus far,
[999.86 → 1000.72] the next slide,
[1001.02 → 1002.78] is this is the first picture of my wife
[1002.78 → 1004.72] kind of walking along the mountaintops
[1004.72 → 1005.50] in Manning Park.
[1006.22 → 1006.94] And next slide,
[1007.28 → 1008.88] this is a picture of my wife, Frida,
[1008.88 → 1010.26] and my daughter Sophia.
[1010.34 → 1011.16] You can barely tell them,
[1011.22 → 1012.42] but we hiked through the clouds
[1012.42 → 1013.42] up at Garibaldi,
[1013.54 → 1014.54] and all we could see
[1014.54 → 1015.54] were these mountain peaks
[1015.54 → 1017.12] just kind of peeking up
[1017.12 → 1018.42] out of the clouds.
[1018.52 → 1020.18] Just absolutely beautiful.
[1020.82 → 1021.88] Because I don't know about you,
[1021.94 → 1023.80] but being in the mountains for me
[1023.80 → 1025.44] is a spiritual thing.
[1025.92 → 1027.40] Because I get a sense of being
[1027.40 → 1029.26] closer to God in the mountains.
[1029.82 → 1031.30] That whether it's in the shadow
[1031.30 → 1032.16] of a big tree,
[1032.34 → 1034.52] or beside the rush of a whitewater river,
[1034.70 → 1036.06] or on top of a mountain ridge
[1036.06 → 1037.18] after a long climb,
[1037.18 → 1039.08] or sitting around a campfire
[1039.08 → 1040.30] after, you know,
[1040.34 → 1041.34] with the stars overhead.
[1042.30 → 1044.92] It's where I best experience God.
[1045.74 → 1048.10] But the wilderness is not all good.
[1048.18 → 1049.10] It can be a frightening
[1049.10 → 1050.58] and dangerous place as well.
[1050.58 → 1051.74] That's why they call it
[1051.74 → 1053.46] the wilderness.
[1054.34 → 1055.72] The wild can be dangerous.
[1056.34 → 1057.18] You might get lost
[1057.18 → 1058.62] and never find your way out.
[1058.74 → 1059.80] You might slip off a rock
[1059.80 → 1061.50] and fall into a gorge
[1061.50 → 1062.76] or into icy waters.
[1063.22 → 1064.56] Weather can change drastically
[1064.56 → 1066.00] and catch you by surprise.
[1066.08 → 1067.38] Or you might come upon
[1067.38 → 1069.30] a dangerous or overprotective animal.
[1069.46 → 1071.04] And I've had a few scares
[1071.04 → 1072.58] with bears in my life.
[1073.44 → 1075.74] The wilderness is a beautiful place.
[1076.16 → 1078.96] But it can be a dangerous place as well.
[1079.78 → 1080.62] It is in the wilderness
[1080.62 → 1081.60] more than anything else.
[1081.94 → 1083.30] We need a safe place to hide.
[1083.46 → 1083.98] A refuge.
[1084.10 → 1084.54] A shelter.
[1084.72 → 1085.20] Protection.
[1085.66 → 1086.04] Food.
[1086.38 → 1086.86] Warmth.
[1086.86 → 1088.50] And that's exactly
[1088.50 → 1090.22] what Psalm 91 is about.
[1091.02 → 1091.78] That Psalm 91
[1091.78 → 1093.40] is one of the most eloquent statements
[1093.40 → 1094.84] of the comprehensive scope
[1094.84 → 1095.72] of God's goodness
[1095.72 → 1096.68] that you can find.
[1097.02 → 1097.38] In fact,
[1097.48 → 1098.82] some people affectionately call
[1098.82 → 1099.58] Psalm 91
[1099.58 → 1100.74] Psalm 911.
[1101.84 → 1103.12] That it's a psalm
[1103.12 → 1103.66] that we pray
[1103.66 → 1104.84] in times of emergency.
[1105.62 → 1106.74] So, it was just read,
[1106.80 → 1107.36] but let me read
[1107.36 → 1108.54] verses 1 and 2 again.
[1108.62 → 1109.26] It reads like this.
[1109.30 → 1109.76] Next slide.
[1110.68 → 1111.70] Whoever dwells
[1111.70 → 1112.22] in the shelter
[1112.22 → 1113.20] of the Most High
[1113.20 → 1115.04] will rest in the shadow
[1115.04 → 1115.88] of the Almighty.
[1115.88 → 1117.60] I will say to the Lord,
[1117.74 → 1118.88] He is my refuge
[1118.88 → 1119.80] and my fortress,
[1119.98 → 1120.72] my God
[1120.72 → 1122.24] in whom I trust.
[1122.82 → 1124.02] What an amazing way
[1124.02 → 1125.22] to begin this psalm, right?
[1125.38 → 1126.62] That in the first two verses,
[1126.96 → 1127.74] the psalmist provides
[1127.74 → 1128.18] not one,
[1128.30 → 1128.64] not two,
[1128.74 → 1129.42] not even three,
[1129.54 → 1131.10] but four different names
[1131.10 → 1132.06] of God.
[1132.68 → 1133.12] First,
[1133.26 → 1134.50] God is the (High).
[1134.60 → 1135.76] This is the Hebrew word,
[1135.92 → 1136.40] Lyon.
[1136.58 → 1137.68] The name signifies
[1137.68 → 1138.60] God's majesty
[1138.60 → 1139.34] and sovereignty.
[1139.70 → 1140.34] The name speaks
[1140.34 → 1141.24] of God the Most High
[1141.24 → 1142.08] who is in control
[1142.08 → 1143.08] of everything.
[1144.02 → 1144.40] Secondly,
[1144.40 → 1145.20] God is called
[1145.20 → 1145.90] the Almighty
[1145.90 → 1147.14] and this is the Hebrew word
[1147.14 → 1147.72] Saddam.
[1148.10 → 1149.04] It literally means
[1149.04 → 1149.54] God Almighty
[1149.54 → 1150.84] but it's also translated
[1150.84 → 1152.82] as God of the mountain.
[1153.82 → 1155.74] That even in wilderness situations,
[1155.90 → 1157.38] God provides for our needs.
[1157.50 → 1158.08] He nourishes,
[1158.34 → 1158.82] sustains,
[1159.00 → 1159.68] and satisfies.
[1160.92 → 1161.38] Thirdly,
[1161.48 → 1162.42] God is Lord
[1162.42 → 1163.80] which is of course
[1163.80 → 1165.02] to say that He is Yahweh.
[1165.14 → 1166.42] That is His divine name.
[1166.66 → 1168.20] It means I am that I am.
[1168.46 → 1169.44] But as I often say
[1169.44 → 1170.40] to younger folks,
[1170.84 → 1171.90] the way to understand
[1171.90 → 1172.70] the name Yahweh
[1172.70 → 1173.64] is that when the world
[1173.64 → 1174.70] says no way,
[1175.30 → 1176.02] with God,
[1176.10 → 1177.52] there's always Yahweh.
[1178.26 → 1179.18] That there's always
[1179.18 → 1180.30] a way with God.
[1180.42 → 1181.76] He sees things through.
[1182.72 → 1183.60] There is a way with God
[1183.60 → 1184.14] but more than that,
[1184.20 → 1185.16] that's His personal name.
[1185.24 → 1186.62] That God is a personable God.
[1186.70 → 1187.74] He wants relationship
[1187.74 → 1188.90] with us.
[1189.74 → 1190.20] And lastly,
[1190.34 → 1191.32] God is my God
[1191.32 → 1192.34] which is the Hebrew word
[1192.34 → 1192.92] Elohim.
[1193.28 → 1194.52] Elohim speaks of God
[1194.52 → 1195.36] as the creator.
[1196.10 → 1197.12] The creator of heaven
[1197.12 → 1197.58] and earth
[1197.58 → 1198.66] and everything in it.
[1199.20 → 1200.02] And God has not
[1200.02 → 1200.68] stopped creating.
[1200.68 → 1202.30] He continues to create today.
[1202.56 → 1203.40] He creates safety,
[1203.60 → 1203.96] protection,
[1204.26 → 1205.68] and blessing in our lives.
[1206.28 → 1207.56] So you put these four names together.
[1208.24 → 1209.12] They pack a punch.
[1209.90 → 1211.02] Lyon, Saddam,
[1211.14 → 1212.40] Yahweh, Elohim.
[1213.26 → 1214.36] Sovereign, majestic,
[1214.56 → 1215.00] provider,
[1215.20 → 1216.26] and caring protector.
[1216.52 → 1217.38] In good times
[1217.38 → 1218.28] and in bad times,
[1218.40 → 1219.24] in mountaintops
[1219.24 → 1220.06] and in wilderness,
[1220.78 → 1221.76] God is our shelter,
[1222.00 → 1222.32] shield,
[1222.48 → 1223.16] and fortress.
[1224.20 → 1225.42] So these first two verses
[1225.42 → 1225.96] of the psalm
[1225.96 → 1227.18] begin with God
[1227.18 → 1228.04] and rightfully so.
[1228.14 → 1229.10] Everything should begin
[1229.10 → 1229.66] with God.
[1230.44 → 1231.84] And then from verse 3 onwards,
[1232.00 → 1233.46] the psalmist reassures us
[1233.46 → 1235.62] that God will look after us
[1235.62 → 1236.98] in whatever circumstances
[1236.98 → 1238.12] we might find ourselves.
[1238.78 → 1239.68] So I just want to highlight
[1239.68 → 1240.20] two of them
[1240.20 → 1241.06] that speak to us,
[1241.12 → 1241.68] I think, today.
[1242.72 → 1243.40] In verse 6,
[1243.48 → 1244.20] the psalmist writes
[1244.20 → 1245.12] of the pestilence
[1245.12 → 1246.32] that stalks in the darkness
[1246.32 → 1247.74] and the plague
[1247.74 → 1249.26] that destroys at midday.
[1250.26 → 1251.86] Pestilence and plague.
[1252.38 → 1253.78] Or maybe in modern day terms,
[1253.98 → 1255.90] disease and pandemic.
[1256.80 → 1257.56] Certainly something
[1257.56 → 1258.80] that speaks to us today.
[1259.10 → 1260.00] This pandemic,
[1260.18 → 1261.04] we find ourselves,
[1261.14 → 1261.74] has caused us
[1261.74 → 1262.40] many physical,
[1262.62 → 1263.02] emotional,
[1263.22 → 1263.62] economic,
[1263.80 → 1264.82] and relational pain,
[1264.98 → 1265.72] and there's still
[1265.72 → 1267.78] no end sight to come.
[1268.54 → 1269.40] In verse 5,
[1269.48 → 1270.30] there is the mention
[1270.30 → 1271.44] of terror of night
[1271.44 → 1272.94] and the arrow,
[1273.12 → 1273.32] sorry,
[1273.40 → 1274.52] that flies by day.
[1275.36 → 1275.72] And here,
[1275.80 → 1276.56] the psalmist seems
[1276.56 → 1277.04] to be referring
[1277.04 → 1277.48] to the threat
[1277.48 → 1278.96] of physical violence
[1278.96 → 1279.38] and war.
[1279.54 → 1280.24] Certainly something
[1280.24 → 1280.98] that is defining
[1280.98 → 1281.70] what is going on
[1281.70 → 1282.40] in the world right now,
[1282.44 → 1282.90] from the wars
[1282.90 → 1284.18] that are going on right now
[1284.18 → 1285.54] to the unrest
[1285.54 → 1286.18] that is happening
[1286.18 → 1286.92] in the United States
[1286.92 → 1287.56] and Hong Kong
[1287.56 → 1288.40] and other places.
[1289.10 → 1290.00] That regardless
[1290.00 → 1291.04] of what we may face,
[1291.12 → 1292.28] disease and war,
[1292.76 → 1294.10] persecution and temptation,
[1294.32 → 1295.26] wickedness and betrayal,
[1295.42 → 1296.34] lions and cobras
[1296.34 → 1297.28] and what they represent,
[1297.74 → 1298.84] Psalm 91 speaks
[1298.84 → 1300.16] of our complete protection
[1300.16 → 1301.10] for it is in
[1301.10 → 1302.18] Lyon Saddam,
[1302.26 → 1303.30] Yahweh Elohim,
[1303.62 → 1304.50] where we find
[1304.50 → 1305.54] our refuge.
[1306.92 → 1307.46] In fact,
[1307.54 → 1308.42] this is the one image
[1308.42 → 1308.86] or metaphor
[1308.86 → 1309.42] that is repeated
[1309.42 → 1310.60] over and over
[1310.60 → 1311.56] and over again
[1311.56 → 1312.44] in this psalm.
[1313.08 → 1313.56] Psalm 91
[1313.56 → 1314.62] is the only psalm
[1314.62 → 1315.50] in the psalter
[1315.50 → 1317.20] that actually uses
[1317.20 → 1317.94] the word refuge
[1317.94 → 1319.14] three different times.
[1319.72 → 1320.54] Not only that,
[1320.78 → 1321.88] synonyms to this word,
[1322.92 → 1323.84] shelter, fortress,
[1323.96 → 1324.44] dwelling place
[1324.44 → 1325.08] and shield,
[1326.98 → 1328.10] convey this idea
[1328.10 → 1329.02] of refuge.
[1329.16 → 1330.12] So to understand
[1330.12 → 1330.94] this psalm,
[1331.44 → 1332.36] we actually have
[1332.36 → 1333.30] to understand
[1333.30 → 1334.72] what the psalmist
[1334.72 → 1335.92] is trying to convey
[1335.92 → 1337.66] with the word refuge.
[1337.66 → 1340.42] So what do we mean
[1340.42 → 1341.02] when we use
[1341.02 → 1342.22] the word refuge?
[1343.18 → 1343.82] Now, of course,
[1343.90 → 1344.34] when you use
[1344.34 → 1345.16] the metaphor refuge,
[1345.16 → 1346.00] we're talking about
[1346.00 → 1346.76] God's overall
[1346.76 → 1347.64] protective care,
[1347.72 → 1348.10] his goodness
[1348.10 → 1348.94] and his presence.
[1349.32 → 1350.08] But for those
[1350.08 → 1350.52] who may have
[1350.52 → 1351.66] historically known
[1351.66 → 1352.38] and recited
[1352.38 → 1353.16] and even sung
[1353.16 → 1353.80] this psalm
[1353.80 → 1354.56] throughout history,
[1355.12 → 1355.96] it is more than
[1355.96 → 1357.06] just an abstract
[1357.06 → 1358.72] kind of metaphor.
[1359.48 → 1360.26] It's also got
[1360.26 → 1362.16] a concrete symbol
[1362.16 → 1364.54] because where does
[1364.54 → 1365.20] every good,
[1365.34 → 1365.88] God-fearing,
[1366.04 → 1366.50] Israelite
[1366.50 → 1367.40] physically find
[1367.40 → 1367.94] refuge
[1367.94 → 1369.00] and God's presence?
[1370.40 → 1370.90] Oh, yeah.
[1371.92 → 1372.90] At the temple.
[1373.86 → 1374.54] The temple
[1374.54 → 1375.38] has always been
[1375.38 → 1375.80] understood
[1375.80 → 1377.02] as a protected space.
[1377.12 → 1377.52] The temple
[1377.52 → 1378.44] is the sanctuary
[1378.44 → 1379.38] and it is where
[1379.38 → 1380.78] God is tangibly present,
[1381.00 → 1381.72] which makes sense
[1381.72 → 1382.56] given the context
[1382.56 → 1383.28] of this psalm.
[1384.24 → 1384.84] Psalm 91
[1384.84 → 1386.34] follows Psalm 90.
[1386.82 → 1387.32] Psalm 90
[1387.32 → 1388.32] is a psalm of lament
[1388.32 → 1389.24] and it is attributed
[1389.24 → 1390.14] to Moses.
[1390.64 → 1391.46] Thus, many scholars
[1391.46 → 1392.24] believe that Moses
[1392.24 → 1393.86] wrote Psalm 90
[1393.86 → 1395.16] and Psalm 91.
[1395.38 → 1395.66] In fact,
[1395.70 → 1396.24] there's a Jewish
[1396.24 → 1396.80] midrash
[1396.80 → 1397.54] that states
[1397.54 → 1398.28] that Psalm 91
[1398.28 → 1399.02] was composed
[1399.02 → 1399.78] by Moses
[1399.78 → 1400.94] on the very day
[1400.94 → 1401.68] he completed
[1401.68 → 1402.28] the building
[1402.28 → 1403.34] of the tabernacle
[1403.34 → 1404.42] in the wilderness
[1404.42 → 1405.46] as they were wandering
[1405.46 → 1406.76] around those 40 years,
[1407.72 → 1408.46] which then begins
[1408.46 → 1409.30] to explain everything.
[1410.44 → 1411.52] In the wilderness
[1411.52 → 1412.98] against the threat
[1412.98 → 1413.50] of enemies,
[1413.90 → 1414.74] in the wilderness
[1414.74 → 1415.46] against the threat
[1415.46 → 1416.14] of starvation
[1416.14 → 1417.26] and the lack of water,
[1417.26 → 1417.96] in the wilderness
[1417.96 → 1418.78] against the threat
[1418.78 → 1419.26] of lions,
[1419.46 → 1419.78] serpents,
[1419.84 → 1420.46] and other animals,
[1420.84 → 1421.50] against weather
[1421.50 → 1422.04] and heat,
[1422.30 → 1423.02] against temptation
[1423.02 → 1424.26] and disbelief,
[1425.04 → 1426.66] God is our refuge.
[1427.34 → 1428.28] In those 40 years,
[1428.38 → 1429.08] God took care
[1429.08 → 1429.80] of his people.
[1430.08 → 1430.70] Pillar of cloud,
[1430.82 → 1431.40] pillar of fire,
[1431.56 → 1432.34] quail, manna,
[1432.44 → 1433.02] and so on,
[1433.10 → 1433.82] and so on,
[1433.88 → 1434.48] and so on.
[1434.56 → 1435.40] So if it was true
[1435.40 → 1437.10] for Moses back then,
[1437.18 → 1438.30] it's the same truth
[1438.30 → 1439.28] for us today.
[1440.32 → 1442.84] God is our refuge.
[1443.90 → 1444.84] And at the centre
[1444.84 → 1445.72] of the tabernacle
[1445.72 → 1446.78] was the Ark of the Covenant.
[1447.78 → 1449.38] And on the Ark of the Covenant
[1449.38 → 1450.40] where the cherubim win,
[1450.50 → 1450.58] right,
[1450.64 → 1452.40] these heavenly angelic beings
[1452.40 → 1453.88] and their wings outstretched.
[1454.64 → 1455.70] And so is it no wonder
[1455.70 → 1456.68] that this image
[1456.68 → 1457.46] shows up again
[1457.46 → 1458.34] in Psalm 91
[1458.34 → 1459.06] in verse 4.
[1459.36 → 1459.82] Next slide.
[1459.88 → 1460.70] It reads like this.
[1461.68 → 1462.46] He will cover you
[1462.46 → 1463.18] with his feathers
[1463.18 → 1464.84] and under his wings
[1464.84 → 1465.88] you will find refuge.
[1466.04 → 1466.82] His faithfulness
[1466.82 → 1467.82] will be your shield
[1467.82 → 1469.18] and rampart.
[1470.00 → 1471.20] That we can take refuge
[1471.20 → 1471.92] in the shadow
[1471.92 → 1472.98] of God's wings.
[1473.76 → 1474.90] And I love this image.
[1475.54 → 1476.24] That we are like
[1476.24 → 1477.68] these newly hatched birds
[1477.68 → 1479.04] dangerously perched
[1479.04 → 1480.28] in a nest high above
[1480.28 → 1482.60] without enough strength
[1482.60 → 1483.34] to fly
[1483.34 → 1485.60] and without enough feathers
[1485.60 → 1486.82] to keep us warm.
[1487.76 → 1488.74] And yet they are safe
[1488.74 → 1489.52] and secure
[1489.52 → 1490.50] under the shadow
[1490.50 → 1491.98] of their mum's wings.
[1492.68 → 1494.08] In the same exact way
[1494.08 → 1495.36] we can take refuge
[1495.36 → 1496.68] in God's wings.
[1497.56 → 1498.42] The psalm then provides
[1498.42 → 1500.08] some of the most amazing,
[1500.32 → 1501.20] comforting promises
[1501.20 → 1501.96] of the Bible.
[1502.66 → 1503.78] That amidst periods
[1503.78 → 1504.52] of wilderness,
[1504.52 → 1506.38] even the wilderness
[1506.38 → 1507.64] we face today,
[1508.70 → 1509.78] Lyon Saddam,
[1509.94 → 1511.22] Yahweh Elohim,
[1511.62 → 1512.96] promises to cover us
[1512.96 → 1513.86] with his wings
[1513.86 → 1515.98] because God is good.
[1517.38 → 1518.64] All the time.
[1520.96 → 1521.56] However,
[1522.56 → 1523.76] some people,
[1524.22 → 1524.94] especially when
[1524.94 → 1526.26] reads this psalm
[1526.26 → 1527.36] quickly or superficially,
[1527.92 → 1529.10] mistakenly think
[1529.10 → 1530.52] that when the psalm
[1530.52 → 1531.18] teaches,
[1531.18 → 1532.58] it teaches that
[1532.58 → 1533.46] being a Christian
[1533.46 → 1534.46] means lifelong,
[1535.00 → 1535.86] smooth sailing.
[1536.64 → 1537.58] That by becoming
[1537.58 → 1538.12] a Christian
[1538.12 → 1539.02] we won't face
[1539.02 → 1539.62] any hardship,
[1539.96 → 1540.24] illness,
[1540.42 → 1541.06] or trouble.
[1541.54 → 1542.52] That nothing bad
[1542.52 → 1543.54] will happen to us.
[1544.20 → 1545.38] But nothing could be
[1545.38 → 1546.36] farther from the truth.
[1547.32 → 1547.82] We Christians
[1547.82 → 1548.82] are not exempt
[1548.82 → 1549.60] from suffering
[1549.60 → 1550.42] and pain.
[1551.18 → 1551.94] Because how could you
[1551.94 → 1552.76] explain all the people
[1552.76 → 1553.20] in the Bible,
[1553.32 → 1553.68] for instance,
[1553.80 → 1554.08] Moses,
[1554.22 → 1554.36] Ruth,
[1554.44 → 1554.92] and Job,
[1555.20 → 1556.76] Job being the classic
[1556.76 → 1557.42] example,
[1557.74 → 1558.14] who went through
[1558.14 → 1559.14] trial and hardship.
[1559.14 → 1561.20] Or of Jesus' disciples
[1561.20 → 1561.70] who were all
[1561.70 → 1562.72] basically martyred
[1562.72 → 1563.38] and all killed.
[1563.92 → 1564.86] Or even the people
[1564.86 → 1565.56] we know.
[1566.52 → 1567.68] We know people,
[1568.04 → 1569.10] faithful Christians,
[1569.32 → 1570.80] have had to experience
[1570.80 → 1572.06] tragedy and pain.
[1572.42 → 1572.98] They certainly
[1572.98 → 1573.98] trusted in God.
[1574.76 → 1575.46] And they certainly
[1575.46 → 1576.42] were not exempt
[1576.42 → 1577.62] from disease
[1577.62 → 1578.58] or hardship.
[1579.54 → 1580.64] But even more so,
[1581.48 → 1582.64] we know that this
[1582.64 → 1583.68] is the erroneous way
[1583.68 → 1585.06] to understand this psalm
[1585.06 → 1586.84] because this is
[1586.84 → 1588.04] the exact way
[1588.04 → 1588.92] that Satan
[1588.92 → 1589.92] wants us
[1589.92 → 1590.62] to understand
[1590.62 → 1591.36] Psalm 91.
[1591.58 → 1592.48] He wants us
[1592.48 → 1593.36] to read Scripture
[1593.36 → 1594.20] incorrectly.
[1595.28 → 1596.14] So let me explain.
[1597.00 → 1597.74] There's a story
[1597.74 → 1598.34] in the Gospels
[1598.34 → 1598.94] of when Jesus
[1598.94 → 1599.54] is tempted
[1599.54 → 1600.14] in the wilderness
[1600.14 → 1601.06] by Satan
[1601.06 → 1602.02] for those 40 days.
[1602.22 → 1602.78] And it's in the
[1602.78 → 1603.48] second temptation
[1603.48 → 1603.96] that Satan
[1603.96 → 1604.74] brings Jesus
[1604.74 → 1605.40] up to the top
[1605.40 → 1605.92] of the temple
[1605.92 → 1607.00] to the highest point
[1607.00 → 1607.48] in Jerusalem
[1607.48 → 1608.54] and eggs him
[1608.54 → 1609.90] to jump
[1609.90 → 1610.66] from the temple.
[1611.32 → 1612.44] To egg Jesus on,
[1612.64 → 1614.18] Satan actually quotes
[1614.18 → 1615.08] Psalm 91,
[1615.22 → 1615.74] verse 11.
[1615.88 → 1616.32] Like Satan
[1616.32 → 1617.28] knows Scripture.
[1617.28 → 1618.06] And he says
[1618.06 → 1618.74] this to Jesus.
[1618.88 → 1619.16] He says,
[1619.56 → 1620.56] throw yourself down
[1620.56 → 1621.72] because God
[1621.72 → 1622.56] will send his angels
[1622.56 → 1623.36] to catch you
[1623.36 → 1623.86] so that you
[1623.86 → 1624.36] will not even
[1624.36 → 1625.24] strike your foot
[1625.24 → 1626.14] against stone.
[1626.94 → 1627.62] Go ahead,
[1627.70 → 1627.92] Jesus.
[1628.68 → 1629.08] Jump.
[1629.64 → 1630.32] God won't let
[1630.32 → 1631.02] anything happen to you.
[1631.28 → 1632.04] God will protect you.
[1632.04 → 1632.52] You won't even
[1632.52 → 1633.24] stub your toe.
[1634.42 → 1634.96] But of course,
[1635.36 → 1636.64] Jesus doesn't fall for it.
[1637.36 → 1638.12] Do not put the Lord,
[1638.20 → 1638.50] your God,
[1638.56 → 1639.06] to test.
[1640.14 → 1641.46] Satan is deliberately
[1641.46 → 1643.02] misusing this passage.
[1643.16 → 1644.10] He wants us to believe
[1644.10 → 1644.92] that being a Christian
[1644.92 → 1646.26] means nothing ever
[1646.26 → 1648.30] will happen bad to us
[1648.30 → 1649.60] and vice versa.
[1650.20 → 1650.94] That if bad things
[1650.94 → 1651.72] were to happen to us,
[1651.78 → 1652.46] well, that just means
[1652.46 → 1653.72] that you have a lack of faith.
[1654.78 → 1655.36] And unfortunately,
[1655.76 → 1656.22] for some,
[1656.62 → 1657.44] this lie
[1657.44 → 1659.38] has worked.
[1660.50 → 1661.30] There are many people
[1661.30 → 1662.82] after becoming
[1662.82 → 1663.46] a Christian
[1663.46 → 1664.96] that have,
[1665.38 → 1666.18] when things have not
[1666.18 → 1666.70] gone well,
[1666.76 → 1667.66] have not gone their way,
[1667.74 → 1668.30] they have become
[1668.30 → 1669.16] disillusioned,
[1669.32 → 1669.60] doubt,
[1669.80 → 1670.64] angry at God,
[1670.66 → 1671.26] and they have even
[1671.26 → 1672.08] walked away
[1672.08 → 1672.80] from the faith.
[1672.80 → 1674.26] Friends,
[1674.30 → 1675.12] we are not exempt
[1675.12 → 1676.34] from disease
[1676.34 → 1677.08] and illness
[1677.08 → 1677.84] and pain,
[1677.98 → 1678.64] far from it.
[1679.62 → 1680.70] So if this psalm
[1680.70 → 1683.28] is not to be taken
[1683.28 → 1684.22] as a guarantee
[1684.22 → 1685.34] that nothing bad
[1685.34 → 1685.96] will ever,
[1686.18 → 1687.08] ever happen to us,
[1688.06 → 1688.68] then how do we
[1688.68 → 1689.48] read this psalm?
[1690.28 → 1691.32] How do we pray
[1691.32 → 1692.04] into this psalm?
[1692.10 → 1692.80] How do we sing?
[1692.88 → 1693.62] How do we recite
[1693.62 → 1694.28] this psalm?
[1694.48 → 1695.46] And I think the key
[1695.46 → 1696.26] to this passage
[1696.26 → 1697.36] is in the last three verses.
[1698.16 → 1698.90] So let me read them
[1698.90 → 1699.48] to you again,
[1699.58 → 1700.60] starting at verse 14.
[1700.70 → 1701.36] It reads like this.
[1701.64 → 1702.10] Next slide.
[1703.40 → 1704.74] Because he loves me,
[1704.82 → 1705.44] says the Lord,
[1706.02 → 1707.24] I will rescue him.
[1707.36 → 1708.26] I will protect him
[1708.26 → 1709.26] for he acknowledges
[1709.26 → 1709.86] my name.
[1710.14 → 1711.04] He will call on me
[1711.04 → 1712.32] and I will answer him.
[1712.64 → 1714.58] I will be with him
[1714.58 → 1715.70] in trouble.
[1716.26 → 1717.14] I will deliver him
[1717.14 → 1717.76] and honour him
[1717.76 → 1718.58] with long life.
[1718.68 → 1719.64] I will satisfy him
[1719.64 → 1720.20] and show him
[1720.20 → 1720.88] my salvation.
[1722.00 → 1722.26] Now,
[1722.34 → 1723.42] note in this last section
[1723.42 → 1724.02] of the psalm,
[1724.10 → 1725.06] the voice of the person
[1725.06 → 1725.94] speaking in the psalm
[1725.94 → 1726.44] changes.
[1727.00 → 1728.20] It changes from the voice
[1728.20 → 1728.92] of the psalmist,
[1729.22 → 1729.46] Moses,
[1730.22 → 1731.54] to now the voice
[1731.54 → 1732.18] of God.
[1732.50 → 1734.04] And look at what it says.
[1734.66 → 1735.60] God now speaks
[1735.60 → 1736.76] and listen to these
[1736.76 → 1737.74] amazing promises.
[1737.90 → 1738.40] Next slide.
[1739.46 → 1740.20] I will rescue.
[1740.50 → 1741.34] I will protect.
[1741.52 → 1742.52] I will answer.
[1742.70 → 1743.48] I will be with him
[1743.48 → 1744.06] and with her
[1744.06 → 1745.44] in times of trouble.
[1745.52 → 1746.08] I will deliver.
[1746.28 → 1746.84] I will honour.
[1746.98 → 1747.62] I will satisfy.
[1747.82 → 1748.48] I will show.
[1749.26 → 1750.68] Seven first-person verbs.
[1751.44 → 1752.40] And right in the middle
[1752.40 → 1754.64] is this nonverbal clause.
[1754.64 → 1755.40] I, God,
[1755.46 → 1756.14] will be with him
[1756.14 → 1756.98] and with her
[1756.98 → 1758.78] in times of trouble.
[1759.28 → 1760.12] There is going to be
[1760.12 → 1760.78] a time of trouble.
[1760.86 → 1761.30] Right there.
[1762.04 → 1763.30] God makes it very clear
[1763.30 → 1763.90] that Christians
[1763.90 → 1764.84] are not exempt
[1764.84 → 1765.62] from trouble.
[1765.92 → 1767.70] But there is the promise
[1767.70 → 1769.50] that he's always
[1769.50 → 1770.56] going to be with us.
[1770.96 → 1771.78] He will not leave us.
[1771.84 → 1772.86] He will not forsake us.
[1773.14 → 1774.14] He is always,
[1774.52 → 1775.86] always with us.
[1776.56 → 1777.80] Through ups and downs
[1777.80 → 1778.68] in good times
[1778.68 → 1779.42] and in wilderness,
[1779.60 → 1780.38] he will be with us.
[1780.42 → 1781.20] He will be present.
[1781.20 → 1782.70] In fact,
[1783.38 → 1784.06] in Jesus,
[1785.44 → 1787.00] it's exactly what happens.
[1787.64 → 1789.06] That God does not leave us
[1789.06 → 1790.12] to our own demise.
[1790.22 → 1790.48] Instead,
[1790.60 → 1791.84] he does come to deliver
[1791.84 → 1792.66] and rescue us.
[1792.72 → 1792.94] How?
[1793.24 → 1795.14] By becoming one of us
[1795.14 → 1796.04] in Jesus,
[1796.24 → 1796.70] Emmanuel,
[1796.94 → 1797.94] which literally means
[1797.94 → 1799.24] God with us.
[1800.12 → 1800.90] God meets us
[1800.90 → 1802.36] in all our fragility
[1802.36 → 1803.22] and our need.
[1804.76 → 1806.50] That's why I need this psalm.
[1807.34 → 1808.50] That's why I need
[1808.50 → 1810.20] to pray this psalm today.
[1810.20 → 1812.14] to immerse this psalm
[1812.14 → 1812.96] into my life
[1812.96 → 1813.86] and into my heart.
[1814.50 → 1815.88] That in whatever circumstances
[1815.88 → 1817.40] I may find myself in,
[1817.66 → 1819.24] that God is with me.
[1819.94 → 1820.90] He's present.
[1821.80 → 1822.80] I need this psalm
[1822.80 → 1824.26] to help me grow in my faith,
[1824.36 → 1825.30] to grow in my trust,
[1825.42 → 1826.62] knowing that God
[1826.62 → 1827.90] has indeed come near
[1827.90 → 1828.92] and he's not going
[1828.92 → 1829.90] to let go of me.
[1831.04 → 1832.48] Because God is good.
[1833.12 → 1835.02] All the time.
[1835.02 → 1835.08] All the time.
[1835.42 → 1836.40] God is good.
[1837.08 → 1838.06] Speaking of Jesus,
[1838.06 → 1840.48] when I begin to see
[1840.48 → 1841.34] how this psalm
[1841.34 → 1843.00] is fulfilled in Jesus,
[1843.60 → 1844.60] I begin to begin
[1844.60 → 1845.70] to understand this psalm
[1845.70 → 1846.44] even more clearly.
[1847.38 → 1848.20] What would it be
[1848.20 → 1849.52] to read this psalm
[1849.52 → 1850.68] as a conversation
[1850.68 → 1852.34] between God
[1852.34 → 1853.60] and Jesus?
[1854.44 → 1855.04] So again,
[1855.14 → 1855.58] next slide,
[1855.70 → 1856.84] starting in verse 14.
[1857.74 → 1858.68] What would it be
[1858.68 → 1859.80] if we read it this way?
[1860.80 → 1862.84] Because Jesus loves me,
[1862.92 → 1863.58] says the Lord,
[1863.72 → 1864.90] I will rescue him.
[1864.90 → 1867.16] I will protect Jesus
[1867.16 → 1868.18] for he acknowledges
[1868.18 → 1868.92] my name,
[1869.26 → 1870.10] Abba, Father.
[1871.10 → 1872.40] Jesus will call on me
[1872.40 → 1874.84] and I will answer him.
[1875.38 → 1876.60] I will be with Jesus
[1876.60 → 1877.14] in trouble.
[1877.30 → 1878.12] I will deliver him
[1878.12 → 1878.78] and honour him
[1878.78 → 1879.68] with long life,
[1879.78 → 1880.72] eternal life even.
[1880.86 → 1881.96] I will satisfy him
[1881.96 → 1883.08] and show him
[1883.08 → 1884.04] my salvation.
[1885.60 → 1887.08] Psalm 91 promises
[1887.08 → 1887.92] that deliverance
[1887.92 → 1888.78] comes to the one
[1888.78 → 1889.94] who puts their trust
[1889.94 → 1890.52] in God.
[1890.70 → 1891.34] Well, who's the one
[1891.34 → 1892.28] who ever trusted God
[1892.28 → 1893.38] more than anyone else?
[1893.38 → 1894.74] Jesus.
[1895.68 → 1896.98] Jesus who trusted God
[1896.98 → 1898.22] more than anyone else
[1898.22 → 1898.96] in history
[1898.96 → 1900.98] and yet he was not
[1900.98 → 1902.16] exempt from trial.
[1902.46 → 1903.22] He was not exempt
[1903.22 → 1904.60] from suffering and pain.
[1905.40 → 1905.78] In fact,
[1905.82 → 1906.50] the exact opposite.
[1906.62 → 1907.58] He took all the pain
[1907.58 → 1908.12] and suffering
[1908.12 → 1909.54] of the world
[1909.54 → 1910.44] on the cross.
[1911.94 → 1913.40] Jesus on the cross.
[1914.62 → 1916.02] It doesn't make any sense.
[1916.90 → 1918.32] It's almost the antithesis
[1918.32 → 1919.12] of Psalm 91.
[1920.32 → 1921.26] Jesus on the cross
[1921.26 → 1922.56] doesn't make any sense.
[1922.56 → 1923.46] His suffering
[1923.46 → 1924.16] and his death.
[1925.08 → 1926.26] Even Satan thought
[1926.26 → 1927.60] he had won the battle
[1927.60 → 1928.84] when Jesus died
[1928.84 → 1929.62] on the cross.
[1930.70 → 1931.90] But what was happening
[1931.90 → 1932.72] during that time
[1932.72 → 1934.70] is God is mysteriously
[1934.70 → 1936.04] working out his purposes.
[1936.50 → 1937.64] It is in Jesus' death
[1937.64 → 1938.54] in this miraculous,
[1938.80 → 1939.52] mysterious way
[1939.52 → 1941.50] beyond our finite comprehension
[1941.50 → 1943.02] that God is working
[1943.02 → 1944.34] out our salvation.
[1945.80 → 1947.60] Good is coming out of it.
[1948.56 → 1949.42] So I wonder,
[1949.42 → 1951.90] do I trust God enough?
[1952.70 → 1954.62] Do I trust God enough
[1954.62 → 1955.52] to know that even
[1955.52 → 1956.32] when things aren't
[1956.32 → 1957.16] going my way,
[1957.54 → 1958.80] God is still working
[1958.80 → 1959.78] out his purposes?
[1960.18 → 1961.70] Do I trust God enough
[1961.70 → 1963.32] to know that he knows
[1963.32 → 1964.48] what he is doing
[1964.48 → 1966.22] and that some good
[1966.22 → 1968.58] is coming out of this?
[1969.20 → 1970.22] It means in the words
[1970.22 → 1971.50] of Paul in Romans 8
[1971.50 → 1973.04] that all things work together
[1973.04 → 1974.08] for good to those
[1974.08 → 1974.82] who love God
[1974.82 → 1976.00] and to those who are called
[1976.00 → 1977.08] according to his purposes.
[1977.08 → 1978.50] That God is working
[1978.50 → 1979.44] behind the scenes
[1979.44 → 1981.08] providentially for his purpose
[1981.08 → 1982.42] and for his good
[1982.42 → 1983.88] more than we can even
[1983.88 → 1984.94] fathom or imagine.
[1986.16 → 1987.18] And even more than that,
[1988.08 → 1989.70] do I trust God enough
[1989.70 → 1991.66] to know that in the process
[1991.66 → 1993.08] he is doing something to me?
[1993.14 → 1995.02] He is doing something in me.
[1995.82 → 1997.52] That he is deepening my faith.
[1997.62 → 1999.68] He is refining my life.
[2000.44 → 2001.62] Through difficult times,
[2001.70 → 2002.86] he is actually strengthening
[2002.86 → 2003.60] my faith,
[2003.98 → 2004.98] renovating my heart,
[2005.32 → 2006.48] shaping and moulding me
[2006.48 → 2007.74] into a more faithful disciple
[2007.74 → 2008.26] of Jesus.
[2010.02 → 2010.90] When you are going
[2010.90 → 2012.00] through hardship and trial,
[2012.12 → 2012.94] who do you go see
[2012.94 → 2014.98] for advice and for help?
[2015.42 → 2016.30] You do not go see
[2016.30 → 2017.18] the person who has not
[2017.18 → 2018.02] gone through things.
[2018.06 → 2018.92] You go to the person
[2018.92 → 2019.96] who has gone through the pain,
[2020.22 → 2021.18] who has gone through the trial,
[2021.36 → 2022.06] who has learned,
[2022.28 → 2023.16] whose faith has grown,
[2023.40 → 2024.40] who speaks with wisdom
[2024.40 → 2025.24] and depth.
[2025.90 → 2027.04] How did they get that?
[2028.50 → 2029.86] Because God was working
[2029.86 → 2032.14] something through the suffering
[2032.14 → 2033.40] to become more.
[2033.40 → 2037.04] That's why I need this psalm.
[2038.08 → 2039.72] I need to pray Psalm 91
[2039.72 → 2040.48] in my life,
[2040.74 → 2041.94] that in whatever circumstances
[2041.94 → 2042.64] I find myself,
[2042.72 → 2043.68] to unequivocally know
[2043.68 → 2045.38] that God is at work.
[2046.22 → 2047.58] He's working things
[2047.58 → 2048.80] all together
[2048.80 → 2049.98] for his good,
[2050.14 → 2051.64] for even my good.
[2051.82 → 2052.94] I need this psalm
[2052.94 → 2054.22] to grow in my faith,
[2054.30 → 2055.52] to ease my fears,
[2055.74 → 2056.74] and to grow my trust
[2056.74 → 2057.68] in knowing that God
[2057.68 → 2058.70] is holding the world
[2058.70 → 2059.46] and me
[2059.46 → 2060.80] in the goodness
[2060.80 → 2061.90] and the hollow
[2061.90 → 2063.56] of his good hand.
[2065.12 → 2066.52] Because God is good.
[2067.72 → 2068.86] All the time.
[2070.86 → 2071.34] Lastly,
[2072.28 → 2073.82] and I've already alluded to this,
[2074.68 → 2076.10] but it is in Jesus' death
[2076.10 → 2077.36] that God shows us
[2077.36 → 2078.08] his salvation.
[2078.60 → 2079.28] As we know,
[2079.36 → 2081.06] Jesus did not stay dead,
[2081.36 → 2082.40] yet in his resurrection
[2082.40 → 2083.12] and ascension
[2083.12 → 2084.10] that Jesus ultimately
[2084.10 → 2085.14] came to experience
[2085.14 → 2086.92] the promises of Psalm 91
[2086.92 → 2088.42] in its absolute fullness.
[2088.42 → 2090.62] He was protected indeed.
[2090.78 → 2091.44] He was delivered.
[2091.58 → 2092.14] He was honoured.
[2092.50 → 2094.14] Jesus is now eternally safe
[2094.14 → 2095.40] and ultimately victorious.
[2095.52 → 2096.40] He sits on the throne
[2096.40 → 2097.94] ruling the universe
[2097.94 → 2098.62] as king.
[2099.82 → 2101.44] And it is because of that
[2101.44 → 2103.64] we can also have the guarantee
[2103.64 → 2105.28] that we too,
[2105.40 → 2105.96] one day,
[2106.56 → 2107.42] will experience
[2107.42 → 2109.22] the promises of Psalm 91
[2109.22 → 2111.20] in their absolute fullness.
[2112.32 → 2113.18] Like Jesus,
[2113.34 → 2114.54] we too will experience
[2114.54 → 2115.14] a resurrection
[2115.14 → 2116.78] that at the end of history,
[2116.78 → 2118.50] God will indeed deliver.
[2118.64 → 2120.34] A final rescue from danger.
[2120.72 → 2121.82] No longer any disease,
[2122.24 → 2122.58] plague,
[2122.72 → 2123.08] illness,
[2123.22 → 2123.48] war,
[2123.62 → 2123.98] pain,
[2124.20 → 2125.14] nor even death.
[2125.28 → 2126.06] And best of all,
[2126.26 → 2127.52] we will be with him
[2127.52 → 2128.22] in the shadow
[2128.22 → 2129.36] of his wings.
[2130.90 → 2132.48] That's why I need this psalm.
[2133.22 → 2134.04] That's why I need
[2134.04 → 2135.60] to pray this psalm today,
[2135.86 → 2137.00] to pray Psalm 91
[2137.00 → 2137.80] in my heart
[2137.80 → 2138.48] and in my life,
[2138.74 → 2140.16] that in whatever circumstances
[2140.16 → 2141.04] I find myself
[2141.04 → 2142.06] to know unequivocally
[2142.06 → 2143.34] that my future
[2143.34 → 2144.74] is guaranteed.
[2146.26 → 2147.72] He has saved me,
[2147.84 → 2149.08] he is saving me today,
[2149.08 → 2150.42] and he will save me
[2150.42 → 2151.08] for the future.
[2151.90 → 2152.88] I need this psalm
[2152.88 → 2154.14] to grow in my faith,
[2154.38 → 2155.48] to ease my fears,
[2155.70 → 2156.66] and to grow in trust
[2156.66 → 2157.46] knowing that God
[2157.46 → 2158.68] has already won
[2158.68 → 2159.92] the ultimate victory
[2159.92 → 2160.98] in my life.
[2162.20 → 2163.84] Because God is good.
[2164.40 → 2165.42] All the time.
[2165.42 → 2166.28] All the time.
[2166.70 → 2167.70] God is good.
[2169.10 → 2169.70] Wilderness.
[2169.70 → 2169.74] Wilderness.
[2171.28 → 2172.66] Don't we all go through
[2172.66 → 2173.58] a time of wilderness?
[2174.56 → 2176.04] Not a geographical one,
[2176.12 → 2176.60] but certainly
[2176.60 → 2177.82] a circumstantial one.
[2178.48 → 2179.86] And often we do not choose
[2179.86 → 2180.84] to go into wilderness.
[2181.46 → 2182.72] We just end up there.
[2183.52 → 2183.74] I mean,
[2183.80 → 2185.00] everything is going fine.
[2185.26 → 2186.32] We've got a good job,
[2186.40 → 2187.26] we fixed up the house,
[2187.34 → 2188.22] did well on an exam,
[2188.40 → 2189.10] made a new schedule,
[2189.24 → 2190.00] kids are great.
[2190.86 → 2191.36] And then,
[2191.56 → 2191.96] bam!
[2193.40 → 2194.14] Chaos
[2194.14 → 2195.10] hits.
[2196.62 → 2197.78] A pandemic strikes.
[2197.78 → 2200.00] We lose our jobs,
[2200.20 → 2200.98] problems with friends,
[2201.14 → 2201.50] sickness,
[2201.86 → 2202.50] or a sudden death
[2202.50 → 2203.06] in the family.
[2203.34 → 2204.70] The world feels like
[2204.70 → 2205.82] it's falling apart.
[2205.98 → 2206.94] Our emotions begin
[2206.94 → 2207.60] to change.
[2208.08 → 2208.80] It's wilderness.
[2210.14 → 2211.64] We feel lost,
[2213.20 → 2213.72] forgotten,
[2215.22 → 2215.90] purposeless,
[2217.04 → 2218.46] aimlessly wandering around
[2218.46 → 2219.74] to find our bearings,
[2220.74 → 2222.10] trying to find a way out.
[2223.36 → 2224.76] Yet, regardless of what
[2224.76 → 2226.38] circumstances we find ourselves,
[2226.38 → 2228.56] what wilderness we find ourselves,
[2228.64 → 2229.74] we do have a choice.
[2230.88 → 2231.86] We can choose beauty,
[2232.30 → 2234.44] or we can choose danger.
[2235.60 → 2238.58] We can choose to come before God,
[2238.94 → 2241.28] or we can choose to ignore Him.
[2242.20 → 2244.18] We can choose to deal with God
[2244.18 → 2245.04] and what's going on,
[2245.06 → 2246.14] to pray this psalm,
[2247.10 → 2248.38] or we can choose not to.
[2249.42 → 2251.20] And I think that's the ultimate question.
[2252.34 → 2253.70] I know of countless people,
[2253.80 → 2254.50] including myself,
[2254.50 → 2255.38] that have undergone
[2255.38 → 2256.84] a wilderness experience,
[2257.16 → 2259.00] a time that we've become discouraged
[2259.00 → 2260.50] and struggled in our faith,
[2260.58 → 2262.02] but through our experience,
[2262.48 → 2264.10] it has brought us closer to God.
[2264.32 → 2265.78] For the only way we can get
[2265.78 → 2266.74] to the promised land
[2266.74 → 2267.50] on the other side
[2267.50 → 2268.74] is that we actually have
[2268.74 → 2270.24] to get through the wilderness.
[2271.92 → 2273.38] That's why I need this psalm.
[2274.84 → 2276.84] Psalm 91 is a psalm of trust.
[2276.84 → 2279.04] In times of trouble,
[2279.16 → 2280.56] will I put my trust in God,
[2280.68 → 2282.78] will I pray this psalm in faith,
[2283.04 → 2283.66] will I pray,
[2284.06 → 2287.34] God, please be my refuge.
[2288.82 → 2290.04] I come to you, God,
[2290.10 → 2290.68] knowing you,
[2290.88 → 2293.14] Lyon, Saddam, Elohim, Yahweh,
[2293.64 → 2295.30] that you will meet me in my wilderness.
[2295.56 → 2297.06] I pray that you will be present
[2297.06 → 2297.88] and be with me.
[2297.98 → 2299.10] I pray with confidence,
[2299.26 → 2300.32] knowing that you are working
[2300.32 → 2302.50] all things together for your good.
[2302.50 → 2304.06] And I pray and thank you
[2304.06 → 2306.08] that you have saved me already
[2306.08 → 2307.46] for eternity.
[2309.52 → 2311.00] Because God is good.
[2311.52 → 2313.32] All the time.
[2314.96 → 2315.40] Amen.
[2316.28 → 2317.16] Let's pray.
[2318.92 → 2319.84] Father God,
[2319.92 → 2321.12] I don't know what people
[2321.12 → 2322.90] are dealing with and facing
[2322.90 → 2324.48] who are sitting in this sanctuary,
[2325.26 → 2326.46] in the fireside room,
[2326.52 → 2327.14] or at home.
[2327.90 → 2328.94] But you do.
[2329.94 → 2331.76] Because you are always,
[2331.76 → 2333.18] always, always,
[2333.18 → 2333.98] always with us.
[2335.08 → 2335.66] Father God,
[2335.72 → 2336.98] I pray that we would grow
[2336.98 → 2338.74] more faithful during these times,
[2339.64 → 2341.42] knowing that you are with us,
[2342.44 → 2343.98] knowing that you are somehow
[2343.98 → 2346.20] working things still together
[2346.20 → 2347.12] for your good,
[2347.64 → 2348.94] that you are moulding,
[2349.14 → 2349.62] refining,
[2350.38 → 2351.98] and growing us as disciples
[2351.98 → 2354.64] with the assurance that we have
[2354.64 → 2355.34] and the confidence
[2355.34 → 2357.58] that you have saved us
[2357.58 → 2358.46] for all eternity.
[2359.92 → 2361.10] Come, Spirit, come.
[2361.76 → 2363.54] and continue to move
[2363.54 → 2364.18] and convict
[2364.18 → 2365.48] and minister
[2365.48 → 2366.42] and
[2366.42 → 2369.24] rest
[2369.24 → 2370.26] in us.
[2371.34 → 2372.32] For we know
[2372.32 → 2373.80] that all who are burdened
[2373.80 → 2374.46] and heavy laden,
[2375.18 → 2376.72] that you give us rest
[2376.72 → 2378.04] in the shadow
[2378.04 → 2378.82] of your wings.
[2379.56 → 2380.64] For you are our rock,
[2380.80 → 2381.20] redeemer,
[2381.64 → 2382.70] and refuge.
[2383.54 → 2384.46] In Christ alone,
[2384.98 → 2386.00] we pray this.
[2386.00 → 2388.06] Amen.
[2388.06 → 2388.14] Amen.
[2396.14 → 2399.46] Please stand.
[2399.46 → 2409.20] and 않을
[2409.20 → 2410.82] for you please stand here.
[2410.90 → 2411.08] Amen.
[2411.32 → 2411.96] Amen.
[2411.96 → 2441.00] In Christ alone my hope is found
[2441.00 → 2445.68] He is my light, my strength, my soul
[2445.68 → 2451.30] This cornerstone, this solid ground
[2451.30 → 2456.26] Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
[2456.26 → 2461.62] What heights of love, what depths of peace
[2461.62 → 2466.94] When fears are stilled, when striding seas
[2466.94 → 2472.74] My comforter, my all in all
[2472.74 → 2477.94] Here in the love of Christ I stand
[2477.94 → 2493.08] In Christ alone you took on flesh
[2493.08 → 2497.70] Fullness of God in helpless babe
[2497.70 → 2501.94] This gift of love and righteousness
[2501.94 → 2507.68] Scorned by the ones he came to save
[2507.68 → 2512.78] Till on their cross as Jesus died
[2512.78 → 2517.26] The wrath of God was satisfied
[2517.26 → 2523.02] For every sin on him was laid
[2523.02 → 2528.18] Here in the death of Christ I live
[2528.18 → 2543.04] There in the ground his body lay
[2543.04 → 2548.18] Light of the world by darkness slain
[2548.18 → 2553.70] Then bursting forth in glorious day
[2553.70 → 2558.30] Up from the grave he rose again
[2558.30 → 2562.88] And as he stands in victory
[2562.88 → 2568.38] Since Christ has lost his breath on me
[2568.38 → 2573.96] For I am his, and he is mine
[2573.96 → 2579.14] All with the precious blood of Christ
[2579.14 → 2594.48] No guilt in life, no fear in death
[2594.48 → 2599.12] This is a power of Christ in me
[2599.12 → 2604.58] From life's first cry to final breath
[2604.58 → 2608.58] Jesus commands my destiny
[2608.58 → 2614.38] No power of hell, no human plan
[2614.38 → 2619.64] Can ever pluck me from his hand
[2619.64 → 2625.20] Till he returns or calls me home
[2625.20 → 2630.42] Here in the power of Christ I stand
[2630.42 → 2637.30] Please be seated
[2637.30 → 2649.68] So I can really relate to what Pastor Albert
[2649.68 → 2651.84] Was talking about with being in the wilderness
[2651.84 → 2655.42] And I think we, all of us are in many ways
[2655.42 → 2657.32] In the wilderness, in different ways in our lives
[2657.32 → 2660.36] But it's a great reminder that God is with us
[2660.36 → 2660.88] In the wilderness
[2660.88 → 2662.34] And because he is with us
[2662.34 → 2663.52] We can pray to him
[2663.52 → 2665.40] And we can seek his wisdom
[2665.40 → 2667.62] And, so I was thinking about wisdom this week
[2667.62 → 2670.72] James chapter 1 verse 5 says
[2670.72 → 2672.34] If any of you lacks wisdom
[2672.34 → 2673.80] You should ask God
[2673.80 → 2676.82] Who gives generously to all
[2676.82 → 2678.32] Without finding fault
[2678.32 → 2680.98] And it will be given to you
[2680.98 → 2683.00] So in our prayer today
[2683.00 → 2684.34] Let's come together
[2684.34 → 2686.30] And ask the Lord for wisdom
[2686.30 → 2687.86] So let's pray together
[2687.86 → 2688.96] Would you please join me in prayer
[2688.96 → 2692.92] Our Heavenly Father
[2692.92 → 2695.62] You have existed forever
[2695.62 → 2698.76] Even before the earth was created
[2698.76 → 2701.14] You lived
[2701.14 → 2704.08] You are the God who knows the end
[2704.08 → 2705.68] From the beginning
[2705.68 → 2708.60] You are the God of all wisdom
[2708.60 → 2710.84] And truth in life itself
[2710.84 → 2715.36] But Father, we live only for a short while
[2715.36 → 2718.02] Our life is like the grass
[2718.02 → 2718.94] The psalm says
[2718.94 → 2721.26] We flourish like a flower of the field
[2721.26 → 2723.68] The wind blows over it
[2723.68 → 2724.66] And it is gone
[2724.66 → 2727.24] And its place remembers it no more
[2727.24 → 2731.12] And so Father, we ask that you would teach us
[2731.12 → 2733.06] To number our days here on earth
[2733.06 → 2735.72] So that we may gain a heart of wisdom
[2735.72 → 2739.72] Lord, help us to live for you
[2739.72 → 2741.64] Not for ourselves
[2741.64 → 2744.10] With the little time that we have
[2744.10 → 2746.16] Thank you, Lord
[2746.16 → 2749.48] For giving us your compassion
[2749.48 → 2754.06] You see how fragile and limited we are
[2754.06 → 2757.54] And yet you show us your unfailing love
[2757.54 → 2760.88] And so Lord, in your love
[2760.88 → 2761.94] We lift to you
[2761.94 → 2763.18] Our many brothers and sisters
[2763.18 → 2767.38] Who are experiencing this fragility of life
[2767.38 → 2770.20] Lord, we first thank you so much
[2770.20 → 2773.24] That Andre has been able to return home
[2773.24 → 2774.32] From rehabilitation
[2774.32 → 2777.54] And Lord, we pray now for his
[2777.54 → 2780.48] A new stage of life
[2780.48 → 2782.68] Even though he now is still in this wilderness
[2782.68 → 2785.00] Lord, we pray for your wisdom
[2785.00 → 2786.34] For him and his family
[2786.34 → 2788.86] Of how to live for you
[2788.86 → 2790.82] In the days that you have given him still
[2790.82 → 2793.90] Lord, we pray for Bill and Nelda
[2793.90 → 2796.84] Whose brother-in-law passed away in salmon arm
[2796.84 → 2800.44] Lord, we pray for your comfort upon this family
[2800.44 → 2802.88] In this time of sadness and in mourning
[2802.88 → 2806.48] And Lord, two of our former pastors
[2806.48 → 2810.76] Are facing health challenges
[2810.76 → 2812.54] So Lord, we pray for Pastor Mike
[2812.54 → 2817.98] Who has undergone some health issues
[2817.98 → 2820.48] Lord, we pray for full healing for him
[2820.48 → 2822.22] For renewal of his energy
[2822.22 → 2825.12] I know he desires to be back in his church
[2825.12 → 2826.68] In ministering
[2826.68 → 2828.78] And Lord, we pray for Pastor Henry
[2828.78 → 2832.92] Who also now is undergoing chemo treatment
[2832.92 → 2835.84] Lord, we pray that the treatments would be effective
[2835.84 → 2837.90] And that they would restore him to health
[2837.90 → 2840.06] Lord, we also lift to you
[2840.06 → 2841.82] Our other brothers and sisters
[2841.82 → 2843.58] Who are battling cancer
[2843.58 → 2846.18] Lord, we pray for Joan
[2846.18 → 2848.38] We pray for Tim
[2848.38 → 2850.14] For Kathy
[2850.14 → 2851.68] And for Kim
[2851.68 → 2854.44] Lord, we just ask that
[2854.44 → 2856.54] Even in the wildernesses
[2856.54 → 2857.68] That they are experiencing
[2857.68 → 2858.98] That you would be
[2858.98 → 2860.56] Present with them
[2860.56 → 2861.90] That you would be all of these things
[2861.90 → 2862.84] That we have talked about
[2862.84 → 2865.38] To them in a real way
[2865.38 → 2867.48] Lord, we lift to you
[2867.48 → 2867.82] Shirley
[2867.82 → 2869.64] Who had another eye surgery
[2869.64 → 2871.78] Lord, we pray that you would restore
[2871.78 → 2873.32] Sight to her eye
[2873.32 → 2875.54] That she might be able to see
[2875.54 → 2877.14] Lord, give her good results
[2877.14 → 2878.38] In healing from the surgery
[2878.38 → 2882.34] And Lord, we pray for our
[2882.34 → 2883.92] Several shut-ins
[2883.92 → 2886.72] Lord, people even in this pandemic time
[2886.72 → 2888.68] Are especially lonely
[2888.68 → 2891.60] Lord, we pray for your presence
[2891.60 → 2893.72] Even when they cannot experience
[2893.72 → 2896.20] The physical presence of loved ones
[2896.20 → 2897.00] Friends and family
[2897.00 → 2900.20] And Lord, we also pray for
[2900.20 → 2901.90] Many other things
[2901.90 → 2903.74] Lord, we pray that you would give us wisdom
[2903.74 → 2905.40] As we go about our daily lives
[2905.40 → 2908.46] Give us wisdom as we watch
[2908.46 → 2910.24] And attend classes
[2910.24 → 2913.52] Give us wisdom as we teach
[2913.52 → 2915.02] And as we learn
[2915.02 → 2917.94] Give us wisdom as we seek
[2917.94 → 2919.68] The good of our neighbours
[2919.68 → 2923.60] And please give us wisdom, Lord
[2923.60 → 2925.88] How to love one another like Christ
[2925.88 → 2928.16] During these election seasons
[2928.16 → 2929.98] That were coming upon us
[2929.98 → 2930.84] In the United States
[2930.84 → 2931.74] And also in Canada
[2931.74 → 2934.02] Lord, give us as citizens
[2934.02 → 2935.86] Wisdom in electing the leaders
[2935.86 → 2937.22] That you would have serve
[2937.22 → 2938.22] In government office
[2938.22 → 2940.60] And give our nation
[2940.60 → 2941.80] And leaders wisdom
[2941.80 → 2943.74] To pursue justice
[2943.74 → 2944.86] We pray, Lord
[2944.86 → 2948.50] And Lord, in the midst of this pandemic
[2948.50 → 2949.22] As a church
[2949.22 → 2950.14] We need your wisdom
[2950.14 → 2952.40] Lord, we seek your wisdom
[2952.40 → 2953.72] To know the best way
[2953.72 → 2955.38] That as a community
[2955.38 → 2956.58] We could worship you
[2956.58 → 2958.30] And gather together
[2958.30 → 2959.52] In a way that is safe
[2959.52 → 2961.90] So Lord, give us discernment
[2961.90 → 2963.68] Especially, Lord, to our council
[2963.68 → 2965.06] Who has to make tough decisions
[2965.06 → 2966.70] Lord, would you be with them
[2966.70 → 2967.26] And help them
[2967.26 → 2969.68] Lord, help your people
[2969.68 → 2970.26] To remember
[2970.26 → 2971.70] That you, Lord
[2971.70 → 2972.80] Have always been
[2972.80 → 2974.14] And always will be
[2974.14 → 2975.62] Our dwelling place
[2975.62 → 2977.26] Lord, thank you
[2977.26 → 2978.02] For your great love
[2978.02 → 2978.90] For us in Jesus
[2978.90 → 2980.56] Who stepped down
[2980.56 → 2982.22] Into a broken and sinful world
[2982.22 → 2982.90] To redeem it
[2982.90 → 2984.86] We pray all these things
[2984.86 → 2985.86] In Jesus' name
[2985.86 → 2987.16] Amen
[2987.16 → 2991.38] So today, as Jake has mentioned
[2991.38 → 2992.92] We will be celebrating communion
[2992.92 → 2995.24] So as we prepare our hearts
[2995.24 → 2997.36] To commune with the Lord
[2997.36 → 2998.00] At his table
[2998.00 → 2998.64] Let's stand
[2998.64 → 3001.58] If you're wanting to do that right now
[3001.58 → 3002.64] And we will sing
[3002.64 → 3004.32] A song together
[3004.32 → 3005.40] How Deep the Father's Love
[3005.40 → 3006.34] To prepare our hearts
[3006.34 → 3025.66] How deep the Father's love
[3025.66 → 3027.56] For us
[3027.56 → 3032.40] How vast beyond all measure
[3032.40 → 3038.70] That he should give his only Son
[3038.70 → 3043.64] To make a wretch his treasure
[3043.64 → 3050.62] How great the pain of searing loss
[3050.62 → 3056.38] The Father turns his face away
[3056.38 → 3062.38] As wounds which mar the chosen one
[3062.38 → 3067.38] Bring many sons to glory
[3067.38 → 3083.48] You hold the man upon our cross
[3083.48 → 3088.38] My sin upon his shoulders
[3088.38 → 3094.86] Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[3094.86 → 3100.62] Call out among the scoffers
[3100.62 → 3106.08] It was my sin that held him there
[3106.08 → 3111.20] Until it was accomplished
[3111.20 → 3117.68] His dying breath has brought me life
[3117.68 → 3122.68] I know that it is finished
[3122.68 → 3126.68] I will not boast in any fee
[3126.68 → 3136.68] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[3136.68 → 3138.68] I will not boast in any fee
[3138.68 → 3142.68] I will not boast in any fee
[3142.68 → 3148.68] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[3148.68 → 3155.68] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[3155.68 → 3160.68] His death and resurrection
[3160.68 → 3167.68] Why should I gain from his reward
[3167.68 → 3171.68] I cannot give an answer
[3171.68 → 3179.68] But this I know with all my heart
[3179.68 → 3183.68] His wounds have paid my ransom
[3183.68 → 3184.68] My ransom
[3184.68 → 3200.68] You may be seated
[3200.68 → 3201.68] You may be seated
[3201.68 → 3206.68] So let's pray together again
[3206.68 → 3209.68] Our Heavenly Father we thank you
[3209.68 → 3212.44] That after so many months
[3212.44 → 3215.74] Of fasting
[3215.74 → 3218.74] From your table
[3218.74 → 3221.74] Lord that we today are able to
[3221.74 → 3224.44] To share this meal together
[3224.44 → 3227.14] Lord even in a way that might be
[3227.14 → 3228.74] A little bit limited from what we're used to
[3228.74 → 3230.74] But Lord even now in this time
[3230.74 → 3232.74] We ask that you would be present with us
[3232.74 → 3234.74] And that you would feed us
[3234.74 → 3235.74] We pray in Jesus name
[3235.74 → 3236.74] Amen
[3236.74 → 3237.74] Amen
[3237.74 → 3242.74] So brothers and sisters we come to this Lord's table this morning
[3242.74 → 3246.74] We're reminded once again that we are dependent on him
[3246.74 → 3251.74] For wisdom, for mercy, and for good fruit in our lives
[3251.74 → 3258.74] For Jesus said truly, truly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[3258.74 → 3261.74] And drink his blood you have no life in you
[3261.74 → 3262.74] Thank you
[3291.74 → 3313.74] Well let's pray right now for Julian
[3313.74 → 3318.74] Father we lift our sister Julian to you
[3318.74 → 3319.74] Lord we don't know
[3319.74 → 3323.74] I guess she has had this kind of health struggles
[3323.74 → 3325.74] And Lord we just pray right now for her
[3325.74 → 3328.74] That she would be able to receive care
[3328.74 → 3329.74] And that she would be okay
[3329.74 → 3331.74] We pray in your name, Amen
[3334.74 → 3336.74] So we will continue to celebrate the supper
[3336.74 → 3340.74] And you know when Jesus said that
[3340.74 → 3344.74] You must eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[3344.74 → 3345.74] And drink his blood
[3345.74 → 3348.74] And in order to have life in you
[3348.74 → 3352.74] Jesus was teaching that faith in him and abiding with him
[3352.74 → 3355.74] Is indispensable for eternal life
[3355.74 → 3359.74] Jesus sustains our life with him
[3359.74 → 3362.74] And will rise us up again on the last day
[3362.74 → 3366.74] And in this simple meal we are reminded of that truth
[3366.74 → 3371.74] And so here now by word and by truth and faith
[3371.74 → 3374.74] We enter into an intimate communion with him
[3374.74 → 3377.74] And so friends if this is not your faith
[3377.74 → 3378.74] We gratefully
[3378.74 → 3381.74] We're grateful that you're here with us
[3381.74 → 3384.74] But we would implore you to refrain from taking the bread and cup
[3384.74 → 3390.74] And use this time to contemplate the love of Christ who gave himself for us
[3390.74 → 3392.74] Who gave himself for the life of the world
[3392.74 → 3393.74] And the love of the world
[3396.74 → 3398.74] So friends hear these words of institution
[3398.74 → 3401.74] The Lord Jesus in the night when he was betrayed
[3401.74 → 3402.74] He took bread
[3403.74 → 3404.74] And when he had given thanks
[3404.74 → 3406.74] He broke it and said
[3406.74 → 3407.74] This is my body which is for you
[3408.74 → 3409.74] Do this in remembrance of me
[3409.74 → 3413.74] In the same way also he took the cup after supper
[3413.74 → 3416.74] Saying this cup is a new covenant in my blood
[3416.74 → 3420.74] Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
[3420.74 → 3423.74] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup
[3423.74 → 3426.74] You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes
[3426.74 → 3428.74] So brothers and sisters
[3428.74 → 3431.74] These are the gifts of God for the people of God
[3431.74 → 3435.74] And let us together feed on him in our hearts
[3436.74 → 3437.74] By faith with thanksgiving
[3438.74 → 3441.74] Remembering that Christ our Passover lamb has died for us
[3442.74 → 3444.74] And, so I've never done this before
[3444.74 → 3448.74] But at the very top here there's this little light plastic flap
[3449.74 → 3451.74] And if you peel the top one
[3452.74 → 3456.74] And if you need help maybe you can ask for help from those around you
[3456.74 → 3457.74] And family members
[3457.74 → 3460.74] So let's remove the top layer
[3461.74 → 3463.74] And we'll have our wafer
[3464.74 → 3469.74] Now I do acknowledge that this is a little tricky
[3474.74 → 3478.74] So the very top layer is a thin flap and that ought to come right up
[3479.74 → 3480.74] Okay
[3483.74 → 3484.74] Alright so
[3485.74 → 3486.74] Brothers and sisters
[3486.74 → 3487.74] Take
[3487.74 → 3488.74] Eat
[3488.74 → 3490.74] Remember and believe that the body of Christ
[3491.74 → 3492.74] Was broken for you

[3549.74 → 3553.74] This reminder that you have given of yourself
[3553.74 → 3556.74] Your broken body and your shed blood
[3557.74 → 3559.74] So that we might be made whole
[3559.74 → 3560.74] That we might be forgiven
[3560.74 → 3566.74] And that we might be brought into relationship with our God and our Creator
[3566.74 → 3569.74] And Lord, as we have taken this meal
[3569.74 → 3570.74] Lord, by your grace
[3570.74 → 3572.74] Give us strength to follow you
[3572.74 → 3573.74] This week
[3574.74 → 3577.74] And on this wilderness journey in the Christian life
[3577.74 → 3579.74] We pray in your holy name
[3579.74 → 3580.74] Amen
[3581.74 → 3583.74] So now I invite you to stand
[3584.74 → 3588.74] And we will go out with the Lord's blessing upon us
[3589.74 → 3593.74] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing
[3593.74 → 3596.74] Now may God himself, the God of peace
[3596.74 → 3598.74] Sanctify you through and through
[3599.74 → 3602.74] And may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless
[3602.74 → 3604.74] At the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3605.74 → 3606.74] Amen
[3607.74 → 3609.74] So let's remain standing, and we'll sing our final song together
[3623.74 → 3641.74] Father, we love you, we worship, we adore you
