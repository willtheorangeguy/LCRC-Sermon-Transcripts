[230.58 --> 260.56]  Thank you.
[260.58 --> 290.56]  Thank you.
[290.58 --> 320.56]  Thank you.
[320.58 --> 350.56]  Thank you.
[350.56 --> 380.54]  Thank you.
[380.56 --> 410.54]  Thank you.
[410.56 --> 440.54]  Thank you.
[440.54 --> 470.52]  Thank you.
[470.52 --> 500.50]  Thank you.
[500.50 --> 506.04]  Thank you for your support once again for all the different families we've sponsored
[506.04 --> 509.30]  and we've always been really grateful for the support of the congregation.
[509.30 --> 510.28]  So thank you.
[510.28 --> 540.26]  Thank you.
[540.28 --> 570.26]  Thank you.
[570.28 --> 600.28]  Thank you.
[600.28 --> 607.28]  And if you're a little bit of a person, and if you're alone, and if you're alone at home,
[607.28 --> 616.68]  can be with you and I'll, you're always to connect with you, you're above your, then, you're
[616.68 --> 618.28]  always, the way, you May, you're visiting us, you say, the day, you say, and Roger, even-and細en,
[618.28 --> 623.62]  you're on your hand, you have to, and inώς, you'llwind as me, and as we're in excess, you'll
[623.62 --> 628.40]  ones that our kids have chosen, some of their favorites.
[629.62 --> 635.46]  And so let the words of today's songs wash over you
[635.46 --> 642.62]  as you think about the Spirit and what he gives us and gives us to do.
[653.62 --> 673.64]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[674.86 --> 679.40]  Who else could make every king bow down?
[679.40 --> 685.58]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[686.42 --> 691.02]  Only a holy God.
[693.28 --> 697.68]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[699.34 --> 703.56]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[703.56 --> 709.84]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[710.78 --> 714.62]  Only a holy God.
[715.92 --> 724.38]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[724.38 --> 728.82]  Cry out, sing, holy.
[729.24 --> 732.38]  Forever a holy God.
[733.38 --> 737.38]  Come and worship the holy God.
[737.38 --> 754.70]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[756.06 --> 760.62]  What other power can raise the dead?
[760.62 --> 766.44]  What other name remains undefeated?
[767.64 --> 771.62]  Only a holy God.
[773.62 --> 782.62]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[782.62 --> 787.62]  Cry out, sing, holy.
[787.62 --> 791.62]  Forever a holy God.
[791.62 --> 796.62]  Come and worship the holy God.
[796.62 --> 803.62]  Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[803.62 --> 804.62]  Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[804.62 --> 809.62]  Who else could offer his only son?
[809.62 --> 811.62]  Who else would offer his only son?
[811.62 --> 815.62]  Who else invites me to call him father?
[815.62 --> 816.62]  Only a holy God.
[816.62 --> 820.62]  Only a holy God.
[820.62 --> 822.62]  Only my holy God.
[822.62 --> 824.62]  Only my holy God.
[824.62 --> 836.62]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[836.62 --> 837.62]  Cry out, sing, holy.
[837.62 --> 838.62]  Cry out, sing, holy.
[838.62 --> 839.62]  Forever a holy God.
[839.62 --> 840.62]  Cry out, sing, holy.
[840.62 --> 841.62]  Forever a holy God.
[841.62 --> 846.62]  Come and worship the holy God.
[846.62 --> 849.62]  Come and worship the holy God.
[849.62 --> 858.62]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[858.62 --> 873.62]  Come and worship the holy God.
[873.62 --> 890.62]  Jesus loves me, this I know.
[890.62 --> 894.62]  For the Bible tells me so.
[894.62 --> 898.62]  Little ones to him belong.
[898.62 --> 902.62]  They are weak, but he is strong.
[902.62 --> 918.58]  Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so.
[918.58 --> 935.34]  Kids, before we go to the second verse, if you want to do any actions that you know to any of these songs, or if you want to make up your own, or if you want to do a little bit of foot tapping and hand clapping, and a little bit of body movement, please go ahead. And adults too, if you want.
[935.34 --> 952.48]  Jesus loves me, he who died. Heavens get so open wide. He will wash away my sin. Let his little child come in.
[952.48 --> 968.30]  Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so.
[968.30 --> 987.54]  Jesus loves me. This I know. As he loved so long ago. Taking children on his knee. Saying, let them come to me.
[987.54 --> 1003.72]  Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so.
[1003.72 --> 1026.68]  I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice. To worship you, O my soul, rejoice.
[1026.68 --> 1045.26]  Take joy, my King. In what you hear. May be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1045.26 --> 1056.54]  I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice.
[1056.68 --> 1065.68]  To worship you, O my soul, rejoice. To worship you, O my soul, rejoice.
[1065.68 --> 1083.68]  Take joy, my King. In what you hear. May be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1083.68 --> 1092.68]  Sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1092.68 --> 1099.82]  You may be seated.
[1099.82 --> 1117.66]  It's a wonderful thing to be children of God, to be called his children, and to be part of his church.
[1117.66 --> 1125.78]  Over the summer, we have been opening the book of Acts about the early church.
[1126.38 --> 1130.26]  And Pastor Jason has been preaching about the early church.
[1130.66 --> 1135.10]  And how the spirit worked among that church.
[1135.10 --> 1142.42]  And kids, you might remember about Pentecost.
[1142.98 --> 1147.22]  When the spirit came. Jesus had already gone up to heaven.
[1147.32 --> 1149.92]  But when he went, he promised to send his spirit.
[1150.06 --> 1152.12]  And the spirit came. And do you remember?
[1152.56 --> 1154.90]  There was a mighty wind in the room where they met.
[1155.44 --> 1158.12]  And tongues of fire came on their heads.
[1158.12 --> 1161.30]  And they started talking in all different languages.
[1161.62 --> 1166.10]  So that everybody that was around could hear the story of the gospel.
[1166.10 --> 1178.16]  And so the Holy Spirit came to give them power, to give them comfort, and to give them, make them able to tell the story of Jesus.
[1179.02 --> 1181.40]  The spirit is still with us today.
[1181.82 --> 1185.34]  And when we have Jesus in our hearts, that's his spirit.
[1186.04 --> 1189.02]  When we love him, he gives us his spirit.
[1189.94 --> 1192.04]  Now he gives us each different gifts.
[1192.24 --> 1193.58]  All of us have different gifts.
[1193.58 --> 1201.16]  But he gives every one of us, every one of us, he gives his fruit.
[1201.62 --> 1204.76]  He says, I am the vine and you are the branches.
[1205.54 --> 1208.18]  And I just want to show you something.
[1212.82 --> 1217.20]  I know one ought not to be proud, but I grew this tomato in my garden this year.
[1217.68 --> 1220.68]  I have never had tomatoes like this.
[1220.86 --> 1222.12]  I moved where I put my plants.
[1222.22 --> 1222.88]  But look at this.
[1222.88 --> 1227.08]  Now a tomato, I brought two, they're both beautiful.
[1227.68 --> 1228.66]  And I have more.
[1230.76 --> 1231.40]  At home.
[1231.72 --> 1237.04]  But a tomato is a fruit.
[1237.56 --> 1241.16]  A lot of people think it's a vegetable because we kind of eat it as a vegetable.
[1242.04 --> 1243.54]  But it's a fruit.
[1243.54 --> 1244.54]  And this is a tomato fruit.
[1244.54 --> 1251.38]  And there are certain things about it that make it a tomato.
[1251.38 --> 1253.22]  It's color.
[1253.22 --> 1255.34]  It's a red tomato.
[1256.54 --> 1257.86]  It is round.
[1258.22 --> 1260.62]  And look at how beautiful that is.
[1260.76 --> 1261.16]  Round.
[1261.16 --> 1263.60]  And if I were to cut it open.
[1263.60 --> 1265.74]  And if I were to cut it open, and I'm not going to do that because it would make an awful mess.
[1265.74 --> 1269.68]  Because I've cut other ones open at home and they're really, really juicy.
[1270.16 --> 1272.24]  And they would make a mess all over the place.
[1272.32 --> 1273.52]  And that would not be appreciated.
[1273.52 --> 1275.56]  So, I'm not going to cut it open.
[1275.66 --> 1280.82]  But I know that this is a sweet and it's a juicy tomato.
[1280.82 --> 1283.98]  And I also know that it's very delicious.
[1285.22 --> 1288.32]  So, it's different than a plum.
[1288.42 --> 1289.86]  And it's different than a peach.
[1290.30 --> 1291.68]  And it's different than an apple.
[1292.18 --> 1296.14]  So, there are things that make this tomato fruit a tomato.
[1297.00 --> 1305.92]  In the same way, Jesus gives us spirit fruit.
[1305.92 --> 1311.18]  And what is it that makes spirit fruit spirit fruit?
[1311.38 --> 1312.38]  Jesus spirit fruit.
[1313.20 --> 1321.92]  Well, if you have Bibles with you at home, I'm going to ask you to turn to Galatians.
[1322.38 --> 1323.14]  Where is it here?
[1323.22 --> 1329.46]  Galatians 5, verses 22 and 23.
[1332.84 --> 1334.84]  I'm going to give you a minute to do that.
[1335.92 --> 1344.32]  That verse tells us what it is about spirit fruit that makes it spirit fruit.
[1345.02 --> 1346.34]  And it includes all of these things.
[1346.40 --> 1352.72]  Just like the tomato is red and it has seeds and it's tasty and it has all those things.
[1352.82 --> 1354.96]  Spirit fruit has all of these things.
[1355.42 --> 1360.02]  And we have all of these things if we have Jesus and if we have his spirit.
[1360.58 --> 1362.22]  So, see if I can remember.
[1362.22 --> 1375.42]  The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[1375.42 --> 1378.58]  Wow, what a list, eh?
[1379.70 --> 1390.76]  And when we have those things, and we do, if Jesus lives in us, we might have to pay real attention to the spirit to help them grow in us.
[1390.88 --> 1391.88]  But we have them all.
[1392.70 --> 1393.98]  They're all there for us.
[1395.64 --> 1396.70]  That's quite a list.
[1396.70 --> 1401.22]  And just like I look at my tomato and my mouth starts to water because I love tomatoes.
[1403.36 --> 1412.68]  Other people, when they see what the fruit of the spirit is like in each of us, they also get curious.
[1412.98 --> 1415.48]  And they, too, want to have that fruit.
[1416.64 --> 1421.16]  And so, when we show that, what that fruit is like, other people want to come to Jesus.
[1421.16 --> 1426.04]  I'd like to sing this little song with you, the spirit song.
[1426.30 --> 1431.44]  We're going to sing it once and then hum along or sing it the second and third times with us.
[1431.50 --> 1431.86]  Okay?
[1432.04 --> 1433.54]  At home, we can sing it along.
[1433.54 --> 1461.26]  The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[1461.26 --> 1491.24]  This is the fruit of the spirit.
[1491.26 --> 1498.26]  This is the fruit of the spirit.
[1498.26 --> 1505.54]  Now we're going to do it one more time so that this week you can open your Bibles to that verse and you can sing it yourself.
[1505.54 --> 1507.54]  The fruit of the spirit.
[1507.54 --> 1529.30]  The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[1529.30 --> 1536.30]  This is the fruit of the spirit.
[1536.30 --> 1537.30]  The fruit of the spirit.
[1537.30 --> 1538.30]  The fruit of the spirit.
[1538.30 --> 1546.84]  And Romans 8.14 says, for all who are led by God, the spirit of God, are children of God.
[1546.84 --> 1551.84]  So what makes the spirit grow in us?
[1551.84 --> 1553.84]  The living water of Jesus.
[1553.84 --> 1558.84]  The food of Jesus, who is the bread of life.
[1558.84 --> 1559.84]  Reading the Bible.
[1559.84 --> 1560.84]  Praying.
[1560.84 --> 1565.84]  Paying attention to what Jesus tells us.
[1565.84 --> 1568.84]  And to what he, the urges, he puts in our heart.
[1568.84 --> 1572.84]  If we listen to the spirit, our spirit fruit will grow.
[1572.84 --> 1580.84]  Early Jesus followers in the early church listened for the spirit and obeyed what they heard.
[1580.84 --> 1587.84]  Their spirit fruit showed others what Jesus is like.
[1587.84 --> 1589.84]  And it made them want to join the church.
[1589.84 --> 1595.84]  The church grew huge with the early church because of the spirit's presence.
[1595.84 --> 1599.84]  And so it's the same for us today.
[1599.84 --> 1603.84]  Can we just pray together a prayer of confession?
[1603.84 --> 1609.84]  Jesus, we thank you for spirit fruit.
[1609.84 --> 1615.84]  We know we need to pay attention to your spirit so the fruit can grow and ripen.
[1615.84 --> 1620.84]  Often we're so busy paying attention to ourselves that we ignore your spirit.
[1620.84 --> 1622.84]  Please forgive us.
[1622.84 --> 1627.84]  Help us feed on your word so the spirit fruit will grow into something beautiful.
[1627.84 --> 1630.84]  And so that others will want to have it too.
[1630.84 --> 1631.84]  Amen.
[1639.84 --> 1641.84]  We'll do it.
[1641.84 --> 1642.84]  Amen.
[1642.84 --> 1644.84]  Everyone needs compassion.
[1644.84 --> 1645.84]  A love that's never failing.
[1645.84 --> 1649.84]  Let mercy fall on me.
[1649.84 --> 1651.84]  Everyone needs compassion.
[1651.84 --> 1653.84]  A love that's never failing.
[1653.84 --> 1659.88]  Everyone needs compassion, a love that's never failing.
[1659.88 --> 1666.96]  Let mercy fall on me.
[1667.50 --> 1679.74]  Everyone needs forgiveness, the kindness of the Savior, the hope of nations.
[1679.74 --> 1683.74]  Sing.
[1683.74 --> 1691.74]  Savior, He can move the mountains.
[1691.74 --> 1695.74]  My God is mighty to save.
[1695.74 --> 1699.74]  He is mighty to save.
[1699.74 --> 1705.74]  Forever, author of salvation.
[1705.74 --> 1709.74]  He rose and conquered their grave.
[1709.74 --> 1713.74]  Jesus conquered their grave.
[1713.74 --> 1727.74]  So take me as you find me.
[1727.74 --> 1737.74]  All my fears and failures fill my life again.
[1737.74 --> 1741.74]  I gave my life to follow.
[1741.74 --> 1751.74]  Everything I believe in, how I surrender.
[1751.74 --> 1755.74]  I gave my life to follow.
[1755.74 --> 1761.74]  Savior, He can move the mountains.
[1761.74 --> 1765.74]  My God is mighty to save.
[1765.74 --> 1769.74]  He is mighty to save.
[1769.74 --> 1775.74]  Forever, author of salvation.
[1775.74 --> 1779.74]  He rose and conquered their grave.
[1779.74 --> 1783.74]  Jesus conquered their grave.
[1783.74 --> 1789.74]  Shine your light and let the whole world sing.
[1789.74 --> 1795.74]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[1795.74 --> 1801.74]  Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world sing.
[1801.74 --> 1809.74]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[1809.74 --> 1815.74]  Savior, He can move the mountains.
[1815.74 --> 1819.74]  My God is mighty to save.
[1819.74 --> 1822.74]  He is mighty to save.
[1822.74 --> 1828.74]  Forever, author of salvation.
[1828.74 --> 1832.74]  He rose and conquered their grave.
[1832.74 --> 1836.74]  Jesus conquered their grave.
[1836.74 --> 1853.74]  Jesus conquered their grave.
[1853.74 --> 1855.74]  Good morning.
[1855.74 --> 1857.74]  This is very different.
[1857.74 --> 1858.74]  In a good way.
[1858.74 --> 1862.74]  It's really special.
[1862.74 --> 1864.74]  It's wonderful to see you all.
[1864.74 --> 1867.74]  Normally I try to look right at the camera to all of you at home.
[1867.74 --> 1872.74]  And now I'll have to remember that some of you are here, which is great.
[1872.74 --> 1876.74]  And so, yeah, we've been making our way through the Book of Acts this summer.
[1876.74 --> 1881.74]  And we'll continue to be in Acts up until the end of November when we hit the season of Advent.
[1881.74 --> 1884.74]  And we'll kind of switch gears and look at something different then.
[1884.74 --> 1890.74]  And today we're going to be covering a big chunk of text in the Book of Acts.
[1890.74 --> 1895.74]  We're going to be looking in chapter 5, verses 17 to 42.
[1895.74 --> 1906.74]  But we're going to be looking at just one key idea out of this text that I think is super important for us to think about together as a church.
[1906.74 --> 1910.74]  And so, before we read, here's some context.
[1910.74 --> 1924.74]  You know, if we remember in Acts chapter 4, you see the apostles already entering into conflict with the religious leaders in Jerusalem because they are preaching about Jesus.
[1924.74 --> 1929.74]  And so, they are warned not to preach in the name of Jesus anymore.
[1929.74 --> 1936.74]  And so, when they were released from being questioned by the council, they go back to their friends.
[1936.74 --> 1941.74]  They go back to their church family, which already at that time is several thousand people.
[1941.74 --> 1946.74]  And they begin, if you remember, to pray together.
[1946.74 --> 1957.74]  They go to the Lord in prayer, specifically asking the Holy Spirit to enable them to continue to proclaim the Word of God with boldness.
[1957.74 --> 1964.74]  And so, you know, I think when we pray that kind of prayer, God often answers it.
[1964.74 --> 1966.74]  And so, they are filled with boldness.
[1966.74 --> 1968.74]  They're filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1968.74 --> 1971.74]  They end up doing many signs and wonders.
[1971.74 --> 1973.74]  They're teaching about Jesus.
[1973.74 --> 1977.74]  They're healing people right before the passage we'll read.
[1977.74 --> 1983.74]  They're bringing the sick out into the street so that maybe the shadow of Peter would pass by them.
[1983.74 --> 1986.74]  Because God is just doing amazing things.
[1986.74 --> 1988.74]  Healing in all the people.
[1988.74 --> 1993.74]  Have so much awe for what God is doing amongst the early church.
[1993.74 --> 1996.74]  The church is growing like crazy, as Marian told us.
[1996.74 --> 2002.74]  And that then brings them into conflict with the religious authorities yet again.
[2002.74 --> 2008.74]  So, we will read now together Acts chapter 5, verses 17 to 42.
[2008.74 --> 2012.74]  And we'll have the words up on the screen.
[2012.74 --> 2014.74]  So, here the word of the Lord.
[2014.74 --> 2023.74]  Then the high priest and all of his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
[2023.74 --> 2030.74]  They're jealous because of all of the notoriety and respect that all the people are giving to the apostles in the church.
[2030.74 --> 2034.74]  They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
[2034.74 --> 2039.74]  Before it was just Peter, and now it's all of the apostles.
[2039.74 --> 2045.74]  But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.
[2045.74 --> 2055.74]  Go and stand in the temple courts, he said, and tell the people all about this new life.
[2055.74 --> 2058.74]  Life? I should say life.
[2058.74 --> 2060.74]  Okay, this new life.
[2060.74 --> 2063.74]  Which is actually a really fascinating word that they use.
[2063.74 --> 2066.74]  Because they didn't have the word Christianity yet.
[2066.74 --> 2068.74]  So, this, this, what is this?
[2068.74 --> 2069.74]  This life.
[2069.74 --> 2071.74]  Right, Jesus brings life.
[2071.74 --> 2074.74]  And so, at daybreak, they entered the temple courts.
[2074.74 --> 2078.74]  And as they had been, as they had been told, and began to teach the people.
[2078.74 --> 2085.74]  When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin, the full assembly of the elders of Israel.
[2085.74 --> 2088.74]  And sent to the jail for the apostles.
[2088.74 --> 2093.74]  But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there.
[2093.74 --> 2098.74]  So they went back and reported, we found the jail securely locked with the guards standing at the doors.
[2098.74 --> 2101.74]  But when we opened them, we found no one inside.
[2101.74 --> 2103.74]  This is embarrassing.
[2103.74 --> 2109.74]  On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss.
[2109.74 --> 2112.74]  Wondering what this might lead to.
[2112.74 --> 2118.74]  Then someone came and said, look, the men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.
[2118.74 --> 2123.74]  At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles.
[2123.74 --> 2128.74]  They did not use force because they feared that the people would stone them.
[2128.74 --> 2135.74]  The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
[2135.74 --> 2140.74]  We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, he said.
[2140.74 --> 2147.74]  Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.
[2147.74 --> 2152.74]  Peter and the other apostles replied, we must obey God rather than human beings.
[2152.74 --> 2158.74]  The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
[2158.74 --> 2163.74]  God exalted him to his own right hand as prince and savior.
[2163.74 --> 2169.74]  That he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
[2169.74 --> 2173.74]  That word prince is really unique in the Bible.
[2173.74 --> 2176.74]  It's the word that means hero.
[2176.74 --> 2177.74]  Archigo is the Greek.
[2177.74 --> 2179.74]  And it's the word used by Hercules.
[2179.74 --> 2182.74]  And so it's really interesting.
[2182.74 --> 2185.74]  Jesus is called hero, hero of heroes.
[2185.74 --> 2187.74]  So he's hero and savior.
[2187.74 --> 2192.74]  We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.
[2192.74 --> 2196.74]  When they heard this they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
[2196.74 --> 2208.74]  But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin in order that the men be put outside for a little while.
[2208.74 --> 2209.74]  And this name might be familiar to you.
[2209.74 --> 2211.74]  This is Paul's mentor.
[2211.74 --> 2216.74]  And so then it says, then he addressed the Sanhedrin.
[2216.74 --> 2221.74]  Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do with these men.
[2221.74 --> 2228.74]  Some time ago, Thutis appeared claiming to be someone.
[2228.74 --> 2231.74]  About 400 men rallied to him.
[2231.74 --> 2234.74]  He was killed and all of his followers were dispersed.
[2234.74 --> 2236.74]  And it all came to nothing.
[2236.74 --> 2243.74]  After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt.
[2243.74 --> 2244.74]  They didn't want to pay taxes.
[2244.74 --> 2249.74]  He too was killed and all of his followers were scattered.
[2249.74 --> 2253.74]  Therefore, in the present case, I advise you, leave these men alone.
[2253.74 --> 2254.74]  Let them go.
[2254.74 --> 2259.74]  For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
[2259.74 --> 2263.74]  But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men.
[2263.74 --> 2269.74]  And you will only find yourselves fighting against God.
[2269.74 --> 2272.74]  His speech persuaded them.
[2272.74 --> 2275.74]  They called the apostles in and had them flogged.
[2275.74 --> 2276.74]  Right?
[2276.74 --> 2279.74]  This is the 40 lashes minus one.
[2279.74 --> 2282.74]  This is extreme torture.
[2282.74 --> 2288.74]  Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.
[2288.74 --> 2297.74]  The apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the name.
[2297.74 --> 2308.74]  Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
[2308.74 --> 2312.74]  So, this is the word of the Lord.
[2312.74 --> 2313.74]  Thanks be to God.
[2313.74 --> 2314.74]  Let's pray together.
[2314.74 --> 2315.74]  Let's pray together.
[2315.74 --> 2317.74]  Let's pray together.
[2317.74 --> 2324.74]  Holy Spirit, would you come and be here among us.
[2324.74 --> 2331.74]  Just as you were with the Holy Church, your powerful presence, calling people to yourself.
[2331.74 --> 2334.74]  Lord, you are still doing this all over the world.
[2334.74 --> 2335.74]  You are still doing this all over the world.
[2335.74 --> 2346.74]  Calling men and women and children from every race, tongue and nation to know you, to worship you, to know this life that is faith in Jesus Christ.
[2346.74 --> 2358.74]  So, Lord, we ask that this life, Lord, that we would receive it gladly and that we would embody it, Lord, by your help.
[2358.74 --> 2365.74]  So, Lord, open up our hearts this morning by your Holy Spirit to, as we open up your word together, we pray in Jesus' name.
[2365.74 --> 2366.74]  Amen.
[2366.74 --> 2367.74]  Amen.
[2367.74 --> 2369.74]  You know, so this is an amazing passage.
[2369.74 --> 2374.74]  And this passage gives us something that I want us to look at today.
[2374.74 --> 2377.74]  It's something that stood out to me as I was looking, preparing it.
[2377.74 --> 2382.74]  And it's this idea of obedience and the necessity of obedience.
[2382.74 --> 2386.74]  In verse 32, it says, we are witnesses of these things.
[2386.74 --> 2392.74]  And so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.
[2392.74 --> 2404.74]  So, here is what, you know, something I've been kind of thinking with, what I think might be kind of a problem, that we face as Christians who believe the gospel.
[2404.74 --> 2411.74]  You know, we always want to emphasize the difference between religion and the gospel.
[2411.74 --> 2416.74]  And so religion says, live like this, and then God will accept you.
[2416.74 --> 2436.74]  And in our day in the evangelical church, there's this great emphasis on gospel centrality, which says that God has accepted you, not because of anything that you have done, but only because and through what Jesus Christ has done in his death and his resurrection.
[2436.74 --> 2442.74]  Right? There is nothing that you can add to that.
[2442.74 --> 2456.74]  But I think what can happen is we begin to believe the gospel and we begin to believe that it means that, you know, it's all by grace and therefore nothing is required of us.
[2456.74 --> 2465.08]  And what I think is happening, you know, for many Christians today is that our Christianity falls flat.
[2466.08 --> 2469.36]  You know, they might say, you know, I've put my faith in Jesus.
[2470.12 --> 2472.50]  I recognize that I can't save myself.
[2472.88 --> 2476.72]  I understand the gospel, but there's something lacking.
[2476.72 --> 2477.76]  Right?
[2477.88 --> 2486.08]  In their witness, in their, the moral choices that they make, in their spiritual growth.
[2486.74 --> 2488.32]  And they can't figure out why.
[2489.52 --> 2496.24]  And I think what often is the case is that obedience is the component that is often missing from their lives.
[2496.62 --> 2503.68]  And we downplay our responsibility of working out that salvation that is a gift of God.
[2504.28 --> 2507.18]  And let me just be super clear.
[2507.62 --> 2512.64]  There is no doubt that salvation from start to finish comes from Jesus.
[2512.64 --> 2517.26]  He, as Hebrew says, he is the author and perfecter of our faith.
[2517.92 --> 2519.98]  I like the way Pastor Tim Keller says it.
[2520.06 --> 2524.00]  He says the gospel isn't only the ABCs of the Christian life.
[2524.08 --> 2526.04]  It is A through Z.
[2526.14 --> 2528.04]  It is the whole Christian life.
[2528.84 --> 2532.44]  That is absolutely fundamental to what it means to be a Christian.
[2533.44 --> 2536.78]  But friends, that doesn't mean that we have nothing to do.
[2536.78 --> 2546.98]  And if we want to grow in intimacy with Jesus, if we want to experience this, this grace that has been so freely given to us,
[2547.00 --> 2552.54]  if we want to grow and move from immaturity to maturity as disciples,
[2552.94 --> 2559.72]  then there needs to be a willingness to want to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
[2559.72 --> 2562.82]  As Paul says in Philippians 2.12, he says,
[2563.22 --> 2573.12]  Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[2573.64 --> 2578.58]  For it is God who works in you to will and to act to fulfill his good purposes.
[2579.66 --> 2579.80]  Right?
[2579.86 --> 2583.02]  And so, in other words, growth into the image of Jesus Christ is a process.
[2583.14 --> 2585.98]  He says, continue to work it out.
[2586.04 --> 2586.94]  It's this process.
[2586.94 --> 2591.18]  And it is a gift from the Holy Spirit at work in us.
[2591.24 --> 2594.36]  It says, for God who works in you.
[2594.44 --> 2595.46]  God is at work in you.
[2595.96 --> 2596.94]  It's not just us.
[2598.40 --> 2601.62]  But we are not passive in this process.
[2602.38 --> 2605.52]  He says, work out your salvation.
[2605.64 --> 2606.30]  It's a command.
[2606.76 --> 2608.70]  We are to cooperate with the Holy Spirit.
[2609.06 --> 2615.46]  And we can't grow a beautiful, juicy tomato if we cover it and we don't let the light shine,
[2615.46 --> 2617.00]  we don't let any water get in.
[2617.10 --> 2620.32]  And we need to cultivate this fruit that is in us.
[2621.52 --> 2623.06]  I love how D.L.
[2623.22 --> 2624.56]  Moody talks about this.
[2624.64 --> 2627.74]  He says, salvation is like a gold mine.
[2628.74 --> 2628.84]  Right?
[2628.90 --> 2634.42]  So you have this precious gift, this immeasurable riches that is freely given to you.
[2635.28 --> 2635.96]  Now, what do you get?
[2636.00 --> 2637.24]  You have to dig it out.
[2637.98 --> 2638.18]  Right?
[2638.18 --> 2642.68]  You have to dig out and get to all those riches that are within.
[2644.10 --> 2647.88]  And again, this has nothing to do with being saved by grace.
[2648.84 --> 2652.30]  It's about working out that grace that has been given to you.
[2653.22 --> 2658.82]  And what we see happening in the early church is that they understood that faith in Christ
[2658.82 --> 2662.68]  meant living in obedience to him.
[2662.68 --> 2668.04]  So now the question arrives, well, what actually is obedience?
[2668.90 --> 2670.14]  What does that mean?
[2671.28 --> 2678.34]  And I think if you want to get to a right definition of obedience, all you need is a right definition of sin.
[2679.48 --> 2683.78]  Because obedience is the opposite of sin.
[2684.90 --> 2686.00]  So what is sin?
[2686.42 --> 2689.80]  Sin is rebellion against God's rule in your life.
[2689.80 --> 2698.68]  The default setting of human existence is that we want to take our own lives into our own hands and be our own gods.
[2699.52 --> 2699.64]  Right?
[2699.70 --> 2701.90]  That's the very essence of sin.
[2703.48 --> 2706.40]  Obedience, then, is the antithesis of that.
[2707.02 --> 2712.18]  If sin is total rebellion against God's rule in your life, then what's obedience?
[2712.18 --> 2712.46]  Obedience.
[2713.66 --> 2718.68]  Well, obedience is total yieldedness.
[2719.38 --> 2721.98]  Total surrender to the Lord's leading.
[2722.16 --> 2726.14]  Totally giving up your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[2726.36 --> 2728.80]  Totally led by the Spirit.
[2730.40 --> 2733.32]  You know, I think certainly this is kind of cliche.
[2733.32 --> 2741.78]  But I really like the metaphor of driving to talk about this idea of surrendering to God.
[2742.64 --> 2742.92]  Right?
[2742.96 --> 2748.30]  When I was in high school, I was the first one among my friends to get my license because I was a little bit older.
[2748.44 --> 2749.36]  So I was like 16.
[2749.52 --> 2751.02]  I think here in Canada it's 18.
[2751.22 --> 2752.34]  But I was 16.
[2752.46 --> 2753.30]  Way too young to drive.
[2753.94 --> 2754.76]  I had a car.
[2755.06 --> 2755.82]  I drove to school.
[2755.94 --> 2757.34]  My friends wanted to hang out on the weekend.
[2757.70 --> 2758.64]  I drove them.
[2759.46 --> 2762.32]  And so I was so used to that.
[2762.46 --> 2763.40]  You know, I'm in control.
[2763.52 --> 2764.42]  I'm in the driver's seat.
[2765.02 --> 2767.48]  You know, and my friends could suggest where we're going to go.
[2767.90 --> 2769.52]  But ultimately, who gets to decide?
[2770.00 --> 2770.88]  I have the key.
[2772.14 --> 2776.60]  Now, we get to Taiwan as missionaries, Christy and I.
[2776.94 --> 2777.92]  And we don't have a car.
[2778.94 --> 2780.66]  But, you know, they have great...
[2780.66 --> 2784.46]  Well, we lived in Taichung at first where there wasn't good public transportation.
[2784.74 --> 2786.70]  But they had, like, taxis and stuff.
[2786.70 --> 2788.92]  So our daughter Ellie was born.
[2790.08 --> 2791.22]  We didn't have a car.
[2792.16 --> 2794.58]  And so we brought her home from the hospital.
[2795.60 --> 2796.02]  How?
[2796.48 --> 2797.96]  Well, we got a taxi.
[2798.26 --> 2802.04]  Now, the taxis in Taiwan, there are no seatbelts.
[2803.14 --> 2804.90]  We do not have a car seat.
[2805.52 --> 2810.14]  And so we get in the back of this taxi with our firstborn baby.
[2811.18 --> 2813.14]  Wrap her, like, blankets and blankets and blankets.
[2813.42 --> 2814.94]  And just, like, sit in the back.
[2815.02 --> 2815.50]  No seatbelt.
[2815.60 --> 2816.14]  No car seat.
[2816.24 --> 2816.76]  And hold on.
[2816.88 --> 2820.24]  Like, for us here in North America, that is insane.
[2820.24 --> 2823.40]  But this is what we had to do.
[2823.50 --> 2827.92]  And it's kind of this big moment in your life when you have to hand the keys over to someone else.
[2828.64 --> 2828.88]  Right?
[2828.96 --> 2831.90]  Up until now, I've been driving.
[2832.40 --> 2833.48]  I choose the route.
[2833.90 --> 2834.94]  I choose the speed.
[2835.40 --> 2836.56]  I'm in the driver's seat.
[2836.56 --> 2846.76]  And if we were maybe here having our children born, you know, I would be going down the road at, like, 10 kilometers an hour with my flashers on.
[2847.00 --> 2850.26]  This huge bucket seat, like, roll bars over it.
[2850.94 --> 2852.30]  You know, going super slow.
[2853.02 --> 2853.96]  Careful as possible.
[2854.28 --> 2855.70]  Honking at everyone who gets close.
[2859.10 --> 2860.68]  So here's why I bring this up.
[2860.74 --> 2863.58]  I'm not saying that Jesus is, like, a Taiwanese taxi driver.
[2863.58 --> 2867.32]  Not totally, but, yes.
[2867.76 --> 2874.24]  Yielding to God in your life means, as silly as it sounds, handing over the keys.
[2875.74 --> 2880.16]  If Jesus is driving, I'm not in charge of my life anymore.
[2880.72 --> 2882.62]  But you're still engaged.
[2883.52 --> 2883.64]  Right?
[2883.70 --> 2887.38]  In fact, you're even more alive than I've ever been.
[2887.44 --> 2889.84]  But now it's not my life anymore.
[2890.18 --> 2891.64]  It's his life.
[2891.64 --> 2895.30]  And he is far better driver.
[2895.66 --> 2896.84]  Far more knowledgeable.
[2897.22 --> 2899.54]  The perfect driver than I could ever be.
[2899.60 --> 2900.56]  I can trust him.
[2901.04 --> 2903.20]  Before, I could only trust myself, really.
[2903.96 --> 2905.78]  Don't trust my high school friends that much.
[2907.02 --> 2908.44]  But I can trust Jesus.
[2910.46 --> 2914.74]  And so if you're asking, well, what does it mean to be obedient?
[2914.74 --> 2924.82]  I think the answer is to think, what is in my life that I haven't yielded over to Jesus?
[2924.94 --> 2928.34]  I haven't surrendered to Jesus Christ.
[2929.20 --> 2931.90]  So for some of us, that might be a habit of sin.
[2933.02 --> 2933.14]  Right?
[2933.22 --> 2935.40]  For some of us, it's maybe children.
[2935.66 --> 2937.44]  It's disobedience to parents.
[2937.44 --> 2940.42]  For some of us, maybe it's anger.
[2941.06 --> 2943.18]  Or it's an unforgiving spirit.
[2944.40 --> 2948.30]  And Jesus says, just let go of that.
[2949.24 --> 2949.40]  Right?
[2949.48 --> 2951.38]  Let me empower you to live differently.
[2951.90 --> 2957.26]  And obedience is taking that step of faith and trusting Jesus in that way.
[2957.26 --> 2960.28]  For some of us, it's actually a sin of omission.
[2960.66 --> 2962.08]  It's something that you're not doing.
[2962.66 --> 2962.76]  Right?
[2962.80 --> 2968.02]  It's the fact that you're not getting up to spend time with Jesus and make him a priority in your life.
[2968.38 --> 2969.74]  Or you don't give.
[2970.32 --> 2972.68]  Or you're not committed to the church.
[2974.60 --> 2980.26]  And friends, what is so important for us to understand is that intimacy with God and growth as a Christian
[2980.26 --> 2985.84]  increases in degrees as we yield our lives to him.
[2985.84 --> 2992.48]  And our obedience to him is coming before Jesus, not perfect, but willing.
[2993.56 --> 2995.24]  That's what obedience looks like.
[2997.04 --> 3000.24]  So with that in mind, that's kind of like a really long introduction.
[3000.64 --> 3002.18]  Longer than I normally do.
[3002.30 --> 3004.96]  But that doesn't mean that now the sermon will be like 50 minutes.
[3005.10 --> 3005.22]  Okay?
[3005.26 --> 3005.92]  That's like half.
[3006.16 --> 3007.26]  So it's okay.
[3008.90 --> 3012.28]  But I do still have three points that will be short.
[3012.28 --> 3022.00]  And, you know, as we look at this passage, I think there are three facets of obedience that I think can help us flesh out what obedience means
[3022.00 --> 3022.94]  and what it looks like.
[3023.20 --> 3024.08]  Just from this passage.
[3024.60 --> 3028.70]  And so the first aspect or first facet of obedience is this.
[3029.30 --> 3032.84]  And if you have your Bibles open, it's in verses 20 to 21.
[3032.84 --> 3040.36]  Where the angel says, go stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life.
[3041.12 --> 3045.52]  At daybreak, they entered the temple courts as they had been told.
[3045.62 --> 3046.20]  Okay, obedience.
[3047.10 --> 3048.54]  And began to teach the people.
[3049.48 --> 3051.34]  All right, so now here's this miraculous event.
[3052.04 --> 3058.20]  God sends a divine messenger, an angel of the Lord, who actually breaks them out of jail.
[3058.20 --> 3069.52]  And if I was delivered miraculously from jail, what I would want the angel to tell me is, you know what, you've had a hard time here.
[3070.90 --> 3072.22]  You've done a good job.
[3072.34 --> 3073.60]  Now go take it easy.
[3073.72 --> 3074.32]  Go home.
[3075.18 --> 3075.60]  Rest.
[3076.22 --> 3076.92]  Have a snack.
[3078.06 --> 3081.60]  But no, the angel does the most counterintuitive thing possibly.
[3081.72 --> 3085.16]  He says, go and tell the people about this new life.
[3085.98 --> 3087.14]  And so what did the apostles do?
[3087.14 --> 3094.22]  It says, at daybreak, they entered the temple courts as they had been told and began to teach the people.
[3095.34 --> 3097.00]  Now what does this tell us about obedience?
[3098.04 --> 3100.74]  I think this gives us one facet of gospel obedience.
[3100.98 --> 3103.60]  And it's this facet called compulsion.
[3104.50 --> 3105.12]  Okay, compulsion.
[3105.98 --> 3111.86]  And there's an author named Ronald Rollheiser who writes about this idea of compulsion in the Christian life.
[3111.86 --> 3121.10]  He says that compulsion is this intuitive sense inside of us that tells us not what we want to do,
[3121.78 --> 3125.50]  not so much what we think is wise to do,
[3126.38 --> 3131.98]  but compulsion is that sense inside us that tells us what we must do.
[3131.98 --> 3134.96]  And he asks this really great question.
[3135.02 --> 3136.98]  I want you to kind of think how you might answer it.
[3137.64 --> 3140.48]  He asks the question, where does faith live?
[3141.92 --> 3143.04]  Where does faith live?
[3143.54 --> 3147.50]  Is faith more in the head, intellectual ascent?
[3148.46 --> 3150.82]  Or is it in the heart, feeling?
[3151.62 --> 3152.54]  How would you answer?
[3152.64 --> 3153.56]  Where does faith live?
[3153.56 --> 3158.78]  And according to the author, the answer is neither.
[3160.12 --> 3163.30]  Faith is rarely, rarely where our head is at.
[3164.08 --> 3166.26]  Nor is it really where our heart is.
[3166.48 --> 3171.70]  Faith is where your, it's a three-letter word that starts with A.
[3172.50 --> 3174.44]  Where your rear end is.
[3174.52 --> 3175.70]  Now he's not trying to be crass.
[3175.70 --> 3190.02]  What he means is, he's saying, it's your commitments, it's our actions, it's our choices that are a better indication of where we stand with faith than what we think or what we feel.
[3190.92 --> 3192.50]  And the Bible says that, doesn't it?
[3192.56 --> 3199.52]  James says, you say I have faith, and I will show you my faith by what?
[3200.24 --> 3201.02]  My works.
[3201.02 --> 3204.88]  Sometimes even the demons believe in God and shudder.
[3205.98 --> 3206.34]  Right?
[3206.40 --> 3207.38]  But they don't obey him.
[3208.40 --> 3218.66]  So in the Christian life, when it comes to reading God's word or caring for one another in the fellowship, and that can be hard and it's time-consuming and it can be messy,
[3219.26 --> 3222.36]  or giving our time or our money,
[3223.60 --> 3227.76]  sometimes the head says, this doesn't make much sense for me to do.
[3227.76 --> 3231.72]  If I asked any reasonable person, they would say, you shouldn't do this.
[3233.84 --> 3239.02]  Sometimes our heart says, I don't feel like doing this.
[3239.80 --> 3241.46]  So what keeps us doing it?
[3242.38 --> 3250.32]  If our head says, you know, reading the Bible or going to church on Sunday is kind of a waste of time, obviously any non-Christian would say that.
[3251.82 --> 3257.30]  If sometimes we just don't feel like doing it, then what keeps us there?
[3257.98 --> 3259.90]  What keeps us obeying God?
[3260.56 --> 3268.54]  And what it is, is that drive within us, put there by the Holy Spirit that pushes us into those places where we know God wants us to be.
[3269.52 --> 3274.96]  And what we see about obedience in this passage is that for the apostles, they had to step out.
[3275.58 --> 3276.00]  Right?
[3276.08 --> 3277.90]  They had to show up in the temple.
[3278.72 --> 3280.14]  God didn't make them do it.
[3280.14 --> 3283.42]  But they went to back.
[3283.52 --> 3284.74]  They were arrested.
[3285.68 --> 3286.76]  They were freed from jail.
[3286.84 --> 3288.14]  They went right back out.
[3288.64 --> 3289.36]  Does that make sense?
[3289.50 --> 3290.14]  Absolutely not.
[3290.24 --> 3291.48]  Did they probably feel like it?
[3291.66 --> 3292.86]  I highly doubt it.
[3293.52 --> 3294.16]  But they went.
[3294.24 --> 3296.52]  There's this compulsion to go.
[3296.60 --> 3298.60]  They must go preach Jesus.
[3299.06 --> 3303.54]  And the Holy Spirit empowered them because they were yielded to the Spirit of God.
[3303.54 --> 3311.00]  In his book, Surprised by Joy, C.S. Lewis writes about this idea of God's compulsion.
[3311.82 --> 3313.48]  And he writes about his own experience.
[3314.00 --> 3316.92]  And I think what he writes is really great.
[3317.02 --> 3318.88]  So I just want to read a passage for you.
[3319.90 --> 3320.86]  He writes this.
[3320.86 --> 3327.62]  I became aware that I was holding something at bay or shutting something out.
[3327.94 --> 3334.84]  Or if you like, that I was wearing some stiff clothes or even a suit of armor as if I were a lobster.
[3336.42 --> 3338.26]  That gives you this vivid image, right?
[3339.28 --> 3343.94]  I felt myself being there and then given a choice.
[3344.78 --> 3347.34]  I could open the door or keep it shut.
[3347.98 --> 3350.44]  I could unbuckle the armor or keep it on.
[3351.38 --> 3356.34]  Neither choice was presented as a duty or a threat or promise was attached to either.
[3357.14 --> 3359.86]  In a sense, I was not moved by anything.
[3360.12 --> 3363.62]  I chose to open, to unbuckle, to loosen the rein.
[3364.42 --> 3369.56]  I say I chose, yet it did not really seem possible to do the opposite.
[3369.56 --> 3373.12]  You could argue that I was not a free agent.
[3373.62 --> 3380.50]  But I am more inclined to think that this came nearer to being a perfectly free act
[3380.50 --> 3383.28]  than most that I have ever done.
[3385.02 --> 3387.20]  I think this is a beautiful passage.
[3387.42 --> 3390.60]  And he's saying that God's compulsion, the sense that I could not do opposite.
[3391.34 --> 3392.66]  It's not because I'm being threatened.
[3392.78 --> 3393.58]  It's not a sense of duty.
[3393.70 --> 3395.72]  But I must do this thing.
[3395.82 --> 3396.64]  I must yield.
[3396.78 --> 3398.60]  I must unbuckle the armor.
[3398.60 --> 3401.24]  I must be vulnerable and yield to God.
[3401.56 --> 3403.88]  And he says that is freedom.
[3404.42 --> 3406.30]  When we experience that, it is freedom.
[3407.52 --> 3413.18]  And so the question for us is, how does your life reflect your love for Jesus on a daily basis?
[3413.18 --> 3416.70]  Will you open the door?
[3417.64 --> 3421.46]  Will you kind of stop being a lobster with its hard shell?
[3422.48 --> 3426.72]  And not out of duty, not out of fear, but because your surrender to Jesus.
[3428.52 --> 3431.26]  Okay, so that's the first aspect of obedience.
[3431.66 --> 3434.50]  And the second facet of obedience is found in verse 29.
[3435.76 --> 3438.92]  When they were brought before the council, notice the response.
[3438.92 --> 3444.42]  It says, Peter and the other apostles replied, we must obey God rather than man.
[3445.46 --> 3448.98]  And so the second facet of obedience, I think, is conviction.
[3449.34 --> 3450.62]  We must obey God.
[3450.68 --> 3451.36]  They are convicted.
[3452.20 --> 3454.18]  We must obey God rather than human beings.
[3454.28 --> 3455.08]  So what is conviction?
[3455.86 --> 3459.20]  Conviction is faith that leads to obedience.
[3460.34 --> 3464.02]  And doing what is right and what is pleasing to the Lord.
[3464.02 --> 3471.34]  And so conviction becomes like a compass that guides their movements, their steps, their actions,
[3471.52 --> 3474.04]  that tells them how to live in the world.
[3475.18 --> 3477.46]  And we can think about Daniel from the Old Testament.
[3477.82 --> 3478.68]  You guys remember Daniel?
[3479.66 --> 3483.38]  He was told that he must not pray to his God.
[3484.46 --> 3490.34]  He could only pray to the God of the Babylonians, who happened to be the emperor himself.
[3490.34 --> 3493.82]  And immediately, what does Daniel do?
[3495.30 --> 3496.40]  He goes home.
[3497.26 --> 3498.24]  He opens the windows.
[3498.36 --> 3498.84]  And what does he do?
[3499.50 --> 3500.28]  He prays.
[3500.82 --> 3502.38]  He prays to the emperor?
[3502.56 --> 3503.70]  No, he prays to God.
[3504.20 --> 3505.58]  Why did he do that?
[3506.06 --> 3509.54]  It's because he knows who the God of the universe is.
[3509.72 --> 3511.56]  He knows the God whom he serves.
[3512.08 --> 3513.20]  And so there is no question.
[3513.90 --> 3517.10]  And he submits himself to the lion's den.
[3517.10 --> 3522.64]  And friends, Daniel didn't know ahead of time whether or not he would be eaten.
[3523.22 --> 3527.26]  And it didn't matter because it was a matter of conviction.
[3527.44 --> 3530.62]  He'd rather go to the lion's den than to disobey his God.
[3532.84 --> 3537.12]  And so whether he is freed, wonderful.
[3538.28 --> 3540.90]  Whether he gets eaten, wonderful.
[3541.26 --> 3542.02]  He goes to glory.
[3542.02 --> 3546.08]  But either way, I will obey God.
[3546.16 --> 3547.20]  It's a matter of conviction.
[3548.32 --> 3553.38]  And even as he obeyed, notice, he continues to show respect to King Darius.
[3554.94 --> 3556.72]  Now here, look what Peter does.
[3556.86 --> 3565.16]  He says, I want to make one thing perfectly clear to you, Sanhedrin, these elders of the people of Israel.
[3565.44 --> 3569.48]  We are here to obey the Lord rather than man.
[3569.48 --> 3576.60]  And that conviction gives them this amazing courage.
[3577.08 --> 3577.78]  They are calm.
[3577.86 --> 3579.98]  They're not trembling and shaking in their boots.
[3580.52 --> 3581.76]  They are calm.
[3582.14 --> 3583.00]  They are confident.
[3583.24 --> 3590.50]  They are courageous before those who actually have the power to kill them and to put them into jail.
[3591.76 --> 3597.18]  And yet there's no fear of man because their fear of God is actually the root of their actions.
[3597.18 --> 3602.42]  They have such a fear of offending God who loves them so much.
[3604.20 --> 3607.82]  Okay, and so that's the kind of second facet of obedience.
[3607.94 --> 3608.88]  So there's this compulsion.
[3609.02 --> 3609.60]  There's conviction.
[3610.10 --> 3612.66]  And that brings us to the final facet of obedience.
[3612.96 --> 3615.30]  And it's found here in the last few verses of our passage.
[3615.86 --> 3617.66]  So beginning in verse 40.
[3617.66 --> 3646.02]  Okay, so it's not stated here explicitly.
[3646.02 --> 3656.64]  But I think the facet of obedience we see here is that this conviction to obey God rather than man is motivated by something powerful.
[3657.18 --> 3661.78]  It is motivated by something that we all need as Christians.
[3662.28 --> 3665.68]  Something essential to what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
[3666.54 --> 3667.66]  And that is compassion.
[3668.98 --> 3671.16]  Their courage is motivated by compassion.
[3671.16 --> 3674.80]  For God so loved the world that he did what?
[3676.20 --> 3683.28]  He gave his only son that whoever would believe in him would not perish but have eternal life.
[3683.84 --> 3688.20]  Jesus looked on the crowds and he had compassion on them.
[3688.60 --> 3693.16]  He loved them because they were like sheep without a shepherd going astray.
[3693.16 --> 3698.32]  When he was asked by the rich young ruler, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[3698.62 --> 3701.58]  Jesus looked at him and he loved him.
[3703.92 --> 3706.16]  Compassion is not love without truth.
[3706.90 --> 3709.08]  It's not just love for love's sake.
[3709.18 --> 3712.56]  But it's the ability to love people towards the truth.
[3713.30 --> 3717.02]  It's the ability to see the world through the eyes of Jesus.
[3717.02 --> 3719.90]  Which is the eyes of compassion.
[3720.44 --> 3723.96]  That wants people to know God, to be saved.
[3725.70 --> 3730.88]  And so how was it that these apostles were able to endure suffering?
[3731.28 --> 3734.26]  The lashes, the beatings, the imprisonment.
[3734.82 --> 3738.76]  Their motivation was they wanted to bring the love of Christ to the world.
[3740.00 --> 3742.64]  And as we look at these final verses here of our text,
[3742.64 --> 3746.42]  it's not just that obedience means courage.
[3747.18 --> 3749.72]  It's that courage is the outcome of compassion.
[3750.92 --> 3755.04]  These disciples went to the temple to tell people about Jesus.
[3755.46 --> 3758.30]  Even though they knew they were putting themselves in danger.
[3759.32 --> 3762.84]  They were allowing themselves to be beaten, to be put into jail,
[3762.84 --> 3768.82]  because they were there to share the love of this Jesus that had come to them.
[3768.90 --> 3771.40]  This life that they had received.
[3771.40 --> 3774.24]  And this is important,
[3774.24 --> 3778.32]  because the only thing that will ever truly motivate us as Christians
[3778.32 --> 3781.94]  to live differently and to surrender our lives to God
[3781.94 --> 3786.42]  is the knowledge and the experience of God's love for us.
[3787.22 --> 3788.80]  Fear is not going to motivate us,
[3788.90 --> 3790.56]  because perfect love casts out all fear.
[3792.54 --> 3795.84]  Love is the only thing that will motivate us to surrender to God.
[3796.28 --> 3799.12]  And Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 14-15,
[3799.12 --> 3800.24]  He says,
[3800.24 --> 3802.98]  For Christ's love compels us,
[3802.98 --> 3807.44]  because we are convinced that one died for all,
[3807.50 --> 3808.74]  and therefore all have died.
[3809.14 --> 3810.36]  And he died for all,
[3810.42 --> 3813.54]  that those who live should no longer live for themselves,
[3813.96 --> 3817.72]  but for him who died for them and who was raised again.
[3818.66 --> 3820.38]  So gospel obedience, friends,
[3820.96 --> 3824.12]  is surrendering every area of our lives to God.
[3824.12 --> 3829.88]  And the evidence that Christ's love has captured and captivated our hearts
[3829.88 --> 3833.80]  is seen in how you no longer live for yourselves,
[3834.32 --> 3836.72]  but for him who loves you,
[3837.06 --> 3838.24]  and for the world,
[3838.74 --> 3840.92]  that they might know this love of Jesus Christ.
[3841.60 --> 3842.06]  And it says,
[3842.06 --> 3843.34]  they were filled with joy,
[3843.84 --> 3847.38]  that they were being used by God to bring his love to the world.
[3848.24 --> 3851.36]  And so our obedience is wrapped up in compulsion,
[3852.06 --> 3852.94]  in conviction,
[3853.68 --> 3854.42]  and in compassion.
[3855.32 --> 3856.64]  So let me pray for us.
[3856.64 --> 3863.76]  Lord, we look at this passage,
[3864.68 --> 3865.80]  and it's incredible,
[3866.50 --> 3872.28]  the way your church would suffer for their neighbor,
[3873.32 --> 3877.08]  that they would be willing to be imprisoned,
[3877.84 --> 3878.64]  to be jailed,
[3879.28 --> 3883.64]  so that this life would be able to come to the world.
[3883.64 --> 3885.18]  And Lord,
[3885.36 --> 3888.46]  we see how they obeyed you,
[3888.62 --> 3890.10]  they yielded their lives to you.
[3890.86 --> 3891.24]  And Lord,
[3891.30 --> 3892.50]  sometimes in our lives,
[3892.54 --> 3893.86]  we find that so hard to do.
[3895.48 --> 3896.22]  And so Lord,
[3896.26 --> 3897.18]  we ask for your help,
[3898.10 --> 3899.32]  that you would loosen
[3899.32 --> 3901.14]  those,
[3902.16 --> 3902.88]  that armor,
[3903.36 --> 3904.72]  that we hold up
[3904.72 --> 3906.00]  to protect ourselves,
[3906.08 --> 3907.44]  that we would surrender to you,
[3908.20 --> 3910.32]  give over every area of our lives to you,
[3910.32 --> 3911.36]  and in doing so,
[3911.90 --> 3914.14]  experience the perfect freedom of the gospel.
[3914.86 --> 3917.60]  We pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[3918.44 --> 3918.70]  Amen.
[3920.26 --> 3922.96]  So now we will sing our song of response.
[3923.08 --> 3923.88]  Maybe let's all stand.
[3924.88 --> 3925.40]  And, sorry,
[3926.36 --> 3927.08]  don't sing.
[3927.98 --> 3929.42]  Hum our song of response.
[3929.52 --> 3930.12]  Go ahead and stand, though.
[3930.12 --> 3942.56]  I think Jesus' song
[3942.56 --> 3945.18]  is something I,
[3945.40 --> 3947.64]  that I could imagine the apostles singing
[3947.64 --> 3949.48]  if it had been written in their time.
[3949.58 --> 3950.10]  And so again,
[3950.20 --> 3951.32]  I invite you to clap,
[3951.42 --> 3954.14]  or to make up your own actions,
[3954.52 --> 3955.68]  move your bodies,
[3955.68 --> 3959.36]  praise God in whatever way
[3959.36 --> 3960.82]  he leads you to do that.
[3960.82 --> 3961.22]  Amen.
[3976.22 --> 3980.90]  Lift high the name of Jesus,
[3981.32 --> 3984.70]  of Jesus our King.
[3984.70 --> 3989.04]  Make known the power of his grace,
[3989.16 --> 3992.50]  the beauty of his peace.
[3992.88 --> 3997.02]  Remember how his mercy reached,
[3997.28 --> 4000.50]  and we cried out to him.
[4000.50 --> 4004.82]  He lifted us to solid ground,
[4005.06 --> 4008.60]  to freedom from our sin.
[4009.04 --> 4012.50]  Oh, sing my song,
[4012.50 --> 4016.40]  and tell all his son,
[4016.88 --> 4018.84]  till the earth and heavens
[4018.84 --> 4021.50]  are filled with his glory.
[4021.50 --> 4031.80]  Lift high the name of Jesus,
[4031.80 --> 4035.54]  of Jesus our Lord.
[4035.54 --> 4039.88]  His power in us is greater than,
[4039.88 --> 4043.30]  is greater than this world.
[4043.70 --> 4047.52]  To share the reason for our world,
[4047.52 --> 4051.28]  to serve with love and grace,
[4051.64 --> 4055.42]  that all who see him shine through us,
[4055.66 --> 4059.22]  might bring their Father praise.
[4059.62 --> 4063.10]  Oh, sing my song,
[4063.40 --> 4066.92]  and tell all his son,
[4067.36 --> 4069.44]  till the earth and heavens
[4069.44 --> 4072.12]  are filled with his glory.
[4072.12 --> 4082.70]  Lift high the name of Jesus,
[4082.70 --> 4086.46]  of Jesus our life.
[4086.46 --> 4090.72]  No other name on earth can save,
[4090.72 --> 4093.98]  can raise a soul to life.
[4094.46 --> 4098.50]  He opens up my eyes to see
[4098.50 --> 4101.96]  the harvest he has grown.
[4101.96 --> 4106.20]  We labor in his fields of grace,
[4106.34 --> 4109.92]  as he leads sinners home.
[4110.34 --> 4113.88]  Oh, sing my song,
[4114.30 --> 4117.70]  and tell all he's done,
[4118.14 --> 4120.20]  till the earth and heavens
[4120.20 --> 4122.94]  are filled with his glory.
[4122.94 --> 4136.70]  Be seated.
[4139.18 --> 4140.98]  So let's spend some time this morning
[4140.98 --> 4141.80]  in supplication,
[4142.34 --> 4144.62]  praying for all of the ways
[4144.62 --> 4146.98]  that we are awaiting God's kingdom.
[4148.20 --> 4150.74]  And so would you quiet your hearts
[4150.74 --> 4152.16]  with me,
[4152.54 --> 4153.78]  and let's go to the Lord
[4153.78 --> 4155.00]  in this community prayer.
[4155.58 --> 4156.26]  Let's pray together.
[4160.52 --> 4161.42]  Heavenly Father,
[4161.60 --> 4163.76]  you are our refuge and our strength,
[4164.78 --> 4166.50]  an ever-present help
[4166.50 --> 4167.50]  in times of trouble.
[4168.70 --> 4170.10]  Therefore, let us not fear,
[4170.20 --> 4171.40]  though the earth gives way,
[4172.50 --> 4173.82]  though the mountains fall
[4173.82 --> 4174.94]  into the heart of the sea,
[4175.78 --> 4178.16]  though the waters foam in war
[4178.16 --> 4179.96]  and the earth quakes and trembles.
[4180.74 --> 4183.52]  Oh, God, the waves continue
[4183.52 --> 4185.44]  to roll over us.
[4186.40 --> 4189.62]  And, God, we feel our human frailty
[4189.62 --> 4192.10]  in the midst of this pandemic.
[4193.10 --> 4195.30]  And, God, we feel our helplessness
[4195.30 --> 4198.98]  as we witness the brokenness
[4198.98 --> 4200.82]  of this world,
[4201.02 --> 4202.60]  the violence of this world,
[4203.02 --> 4204.88]  even as the West Coast is,
[4205.98 --> 4207.28]  there are many forest fires
[4207.28 --> 4208.98]  and we are surrounded by smoke.
[4208.98 --> 4212.18]  And, Lord, we cry out to you.
[4213.12 --> 4215.90]  You tell us that when we call out to you
[4215.90 --> 4217.84]  that you hear us in our distress,
[4218.26 --> 4219.68]  that you turn your ear
[4219.68 --> 4220.58]  to the brokenhearted,
[4221.22 --> 4223.34]  that you grieve with us,
[4223.90 --> 4226.20]  that you plead for us,
[4226.90 --> 4228.88]  that you walk with us,
[4229.42 --> 4231.58]  that our lives matter to you,
[4231.58 --> 4234.46]  and that we are loved by you.
[4236.08 --> 4238.48]  So, Father, we bring before you this morning
[4238.48 --> 4239.90]  all of our neediness
[4239.90 --> 4242.04]  and our brokenness.
[4242.86 --> 4244.84]  God, we bring before you the aging,
[4245.40 --> 4248.32]  those in assisted living,
[4248.50 --> 4249.40]  in nursing homes,
[4249.50 --> 4252.50]  or those who are just home by themselves.
[4253.04 --> 4255.44]  Oh, God, in a society that values youth
[4255.44 --> 4258.38]  and sees their lives as having less value.
[4259.08 --> 4261.58]  God, will you deliver them
[4261.58 --> 4263.88]  from loneliness and neglect.
[4264.46 --> 4266.74]  Lord, help us to be a church
[4266.74 --> 4269.72]  that would be present
[4269.72 --> 4271.00]  to those who are lonely
[4271.00 --> 4273.94]  in whatever ways we are able to right now.
[4274.98 --> 4276.62]  God, we bring before you the young,
[4277.58 --> 4279.44]  children, and parents.
[4280.66 --> 4283.58]  A school resumes many parents are anxious
[4283.58 --> 4285.30]  sending their kids to school.
[4286.18 --> 4287.68]  And, Lord, we ask that you would be
[4287.68 --> 4288.56]  with the parents,
[4289.66 --> 4290.96]  that you would be with the children,
[4291.36 --> 4292.08]  with the teachers,
[4292.88 --> 4293.84]  the school administrators.
[4294.76 --> 4295.88]  Lord, help them to care
[4295.88 --> 4299.14]  for the children of our city,
[4299.38 --> 4300.26]  of our community,
[4301.20 --> 4302.28]  and to teach them well.
[4303.18 --> 4304.66]  Give peace to the parents.
[4305.80 --> 4308.20]  And, Lord, in this return to school,
[4308.20 --> 4309.02]  we look to you.
[4310.66 --> 4312.52]  Lord, you have called us to be defenders
[4312.52 --> 4314.74]  of the refugee and the immigrant,
[4315.30 --> 4317.26]  to plead the case of those
[4317.26 --> 4319.02]  who do not have a voice.
[4319.94 --> 4321.02]  And we praise you
[4321.02 --> 4323.76]  for bringing the Arga family here
[4323.76 --> 4325.46]  very soon,
[4326.02 --> 4327.70]  Lord, after nine years of waiting.
[4328.98 --> 4330.24]  And so, Lord, as they come,
[4331.20 --> 4332.62]  and even as they quarantine,
[4332.82 --> 4334.96]  Lord, help them to do so
[4334.96 --> 4336.14]  with patience.
[4336.74 --> 4337.72]  Help them to get settled
[4337.72 --> 4338.92]  into their life in Canada.
[4339.52 --> 4340.66]  Help us as a church
[4340.66 --> 4341.70]  to welcome them,
[4341.78 --> 4342.52]  to serve them,
[4342.54 --> 4343.12]  and love them.
[4343.72 --> 4345.20]  Make them feel part of this community.
[4345.52 --> 4346.76]  And, Lord, show them Jesus
[4346.76 --> 4347.96]  in all that we do
[4347.96 --> 4348.76]  and all that we say.
[4350.44 --> 4351.62]  Jesus, our healer,
[4351.72 --> 4352.80]  we bring before you
[4352.80 --> 4354.96]  our members and friends,
[4355.10 --> 4356.84]  people with all kinds of sicknesses
[4356.84 --> 4357.52]  and who are suffering.
[4358.08 --> 4359.60]  We pray for George and Kim
[4359.60 --> 4362.18]  with Kim's recurrence of cancer.
[4362.98 --> 4364.28]  Lord, we ask for your mercy
[4364.28 --> 4366.06]  on this family,
[4366.44 --> 4367.68]  for strength for them,
[4367.68 --> 4368.96]  for encouragement
[4368.96 --> 4370.70]  from friends and church family,
[4371.10 --> 4373.64]  for the work of doctors
[4373.64 --> 4374.68]  who are caring for her.
[4375.90 --> 4377.12]  Lord, we pray for healing,
[4377.78 --> 4378.84]  peace, power,
[4379.02 --> 4379.74]  your presence,
[4380.46 --> 4382.98]  for Tim, Kathy, and Joan.
[4383.64 --> 4385.40]  We lift them up to you
[4385.40 --> 4387.54]  because you are their Heavenly Father
[4387.54 --> 4388.76]  who loves them and keeps them.
[4389.92 --> 4390.62]  Holy Spirit,
[4390.74 --> 4393.66]  we pray for your help.
[4394.02 --> 4395.32]  Lord, would you be with Andre
[4395.32 --> 4396.60]  and his family.
[4397.32 --> 4398.24]  And, Lord, in hope,
[4398.34 --> 4399.24]  we ask that you would
[4399.24 --> 4400.18]  grant him mobility,
[4400.84 --> 4402.34]  heal his legs and his back.
[4402.94 --> 4404.54]  May he be able to walk again.
[4405.40 --> 4408.32]  All things are possible for you
[4408.32 --> 4409.82]  because you are the God
[4409.82 --> 4411.48]  who created our bodies.
[4412.00 --> 4412.48]  You are the God
[4412.48 --> 4413.96]  who gives us breath,
[4414.06 --> 4415.30]  every breath that we take.
[4415.96 --> 4417.36]  And, Lord, we belong to you.
[4418.16 --> 4419.90]  So we bring all of our supplications
[4419.90 --> 4421.52]  and requests to you,
[4421.68 --> 4422.34]  our Lord,
[4422.34 --> 4423.82]  because you, Lord,
[4423.92 --> 4425.04]  are our refuge
[4425.04 --> 4427.32]  and our strength.
[4428.04 --> 4429.42]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4430.12 --> 4430.38]  Amen.
[4432.30 --> 4433.24]  So now, friends,
[4433.38 --> 4435.50]  we go out from here
[4435.50 --> 4437.70]  having heard the word,
[4437.86 --> 4440.62]  having heard the songs
[4440.62 --> 4441.80]  and prayed together.
[4441.90 --> 4443.32]  Let's go out with the Spirit,
[4443.74 --> 4445.66]  the Father's blessing upon us.
[4445.76 --> 4447.50]  So I invite you to hold out your hands,
[4447.66 --> 4448.94]  receive the benediction.
[4448.94 --> 4449.64]  Sure, stand.
[4451.70 --> 4452.76]  And hold out your hands.
[4454.20 --> 4456.30]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4457.42 --> 4458.88]  may the love of God,
[4458.98 --> 4459.94]  our Heavenly Father,
[4460.64 --> 4462.94]  may the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[4462.94 --> 4463.82]  be with you all.
[4464.48 --> 4465.62]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[4466.00 --> 4466.26]  Amen.
[4466.94 --> 4468.48]  So let's sing our song of response.
[4468.48 --> 4483.48]  Lord of lords,
[4483.60 --> 4485.72]  King of kings,
[4485.72 --> 4490.28]  you alone are worthy.
[4490.96 --> 4495.98]  All the earth and heaven sings,
[4495.98 --> 4499.80]  praise is to your name.
[4499.80 --> 4503.58]  Lamb of God,
[4503.66 --> 4505.72]  holy one,
[4506.00 --> 4509.94]  righteous and forgiving,
[4510.82 --> 4512.98]  morning sun,
[4513.56 --> 4515.56]  rising sun,
[4516.00 --> 4519.74]  there is none like you.
[4520.94 --> 4522.94]  Praise the Father,
[4523.46 --> 4525.60]  praise the Son,
[4525.60 --> 4527.92]  praise the Spirit,
[4527.92 --> 4530.44]  every one,
[4530.44 --> 4534.92]  praise the King of glory,
[4535.48 --> 4539.66]  praise Him for eternity.
[4540.66 --> 4542.88]  Praise the Father,
[4543.42 --> 4545.40]  praise the Son,
[4546.08 --> 4548.04]  praise the Spirit,
[4548.62 --> 4550.46]  every one,
[4551.10 --> 4555.20]  praise the King of glory,
[4555.20 --> 4560.52]  praise Him for eternity.
[4560.52 --> 4561.10]  Praise the King of glory,
[4561.24 --> 4562.78]  praise Him for eternity.
[4563.00 --> 4579.60]  Praise the King of glory,
[4579.60 --> 4580.10]  praise Him for eternity.
[4580.10 --> 4580.96]  Praise the King of glory,
[4580.96 --> 4581.14]  praise Him for eternity.
[4581.14 --> 4581.22]  Praise the King of glory,
[4581.22 --> 4585.08]  praise Him for eternity.
