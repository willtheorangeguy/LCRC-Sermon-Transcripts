• Longing for God to show favour and invite us into his presence
• Three ways God fulfills our longing for grace: 
  • Unexpected people receive grace
  • Grace comes in unexpected ways
  • Grace pulls us into God's story
• The concept of God's grace and favour
• Mary's unique circumstances as a young, female, poor, unmarried, and childless individual in a patriarchal society
• Luke's portrayal of God's activity as surprising, paradoxical, and often reversing human expectations
• The idea that God's grace is freely given without merit or deservingness
• Contrasting perspectives on human achievement vs. God's unearned favour
• The Bible's account of Mary's reaction to Gabriel's greeting
• God's favour and grace towards Mary despite her humble circumstances

• The angel's answer, stating that the Holy Spirit will overshadow her
• The angel Gabriel appears to Mary and informs her that she will conceive a child, Jesus.
• The conception of Jesus will be miraculous, not the result of human relationship between Mary and Joseph.
• Jesus will be born with a fully human nature, yet also be the Holy Son of God.
• As Christians believe, Jesus' humanity is confirmed through his physical development in Mary's womb, including being nourished by her blood.
• Jesus is fully human and fully God
• He will forgive sins, exercise power over nature, multiply food to feed thousands, cast out demons, heal the sick, and raise people from the dead
• Jesus has two natures: human and divine, in one person
• The Bible teaches this about Jesus, and no other person in human history or imagination could have expected it to happen
• The Saviour would come and save God's people
• There was no expectation that the Messiah would be God himself
• God would come down to earth, wrapping himself in human frailty
• This was an unexpected plan of God
• Mark Twain wrote a story called "The Prince and the Pauper" as an example
• The story shows how a poor boy can switch lives with a prince and experience their different circumstances.
• A beggar is mistaken for the prince and thrown out of the palace
• The real prince is thrown into the street, while the beggar is treated like royalty
• This mirrors Jesus' example of coming to earth as a servant and being humble
• God dresses believers in righteousness through Jesus, giving them favour and treating them like princes
• Jesus' coming is associated with wearing righteousness
• God's plan of grace exceeds human expectations
• God shows up unexpectedly, even in humble ways such as birth
• God's gift of salvation comes to those who don't deserve it
• God's ways of showing grace are often unexpected and unimagined
• God's vision and plan for the world
• The question of how to respond to unexpected divine intervention
• Mary's response to Gabriel, exemplifying humility and surrender to God's will
