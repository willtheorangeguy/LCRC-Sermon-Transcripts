[357.64 → 361.04] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[361.72 → 367.06] We are worshipping in person today in limited numbers and also via live-streaming.
[367.72 → 371.62] Whether you are in our church building or sitting in your living room,
[372.16 → 377.28] we as a community are meeting today together to worship the living God.
[378.58 → 383.68] While those here in the sanctuary are asked to keep their masks on during the service,
[384.18 → 386.16] we are now permitted to sing.
[386.16 → 389.10] I know you've all been doing this already.
[389.60 → 390.68] Now it's legal.
[392.50 → 395.82] Our offering today is for Resonate Global Mission,
[396.26 → 400.82] which supports missionaries, chaplains, our seafarers' ministry,
[401.30 → 405.10] and church planters both in North America and abroad.
[405.62 → 410.26] You may drop off your offering at the church or donate online.
[410.26 → 418.46] Today, helping us all to worship are Jake, Don, and Kayla on audio and projection,
[419.46 → 423.38] Tony, Harry, John, and Roger on music.
[424.12 → 426.62] I'm BEV, and I'll be worship leading.
[427.08 → 429.44] And Pastor Jason will bring us God's word.
[429.44 → 434.72] Today, we welcome our newest family.
[435.06 → 436.54] John is going to introduce them.
[443.16 → 445.76] I'd like to ask the Area family if you can come up.
[445.76 → 459.30] Go ahead.
[461.30 → 462.12] Stay there.
[462.68 → 464.48] Maybe you take your mask off so I can see you.
[464.48 → 474.40] So this is the Area family.
[474.52 → 476.80] They've been in Canada now about three weeks,
[477.02 → 478.52] so I'd like to introduce them to you.
[479.06 → 481.48] We have Kikuyu right here,
[482.66 → 482.92] Kia,
[483.92 → 487.76] and the girls Leana and Market.
[487.76 → 496.64] The Areas have an apartment in Towson.
[496.74 → 498.14] They've been here three weeks, as I said.
[498.28 → 500.16] They spent the first two weeks in quarantine,
[500.58 → 503.92] so they've been out and about seeing some of the sights around here,
[503.98 → 504.64] been to the beach,
[504.74 → 507.16] and I think they went to the North Shore yesterday with...
[507.16 → 507.50] Stevenson.
[508.00 → 508.40] Stevenson.
[508.52 → 508.74] Okay.
[508.88 → 510.86] He said mountains, but...
[510.86 → 511.76] Richmond Mountains.
[514.80 → 516.48] So anyway, welcome to you,
[516.48 → 520.48] and we encourage our congregation to get to know you,
[520.64 → 522.22] and I'm sure you'll get to know us,
[522.48 → 524.96] and it's a blessing that you can be with us.
[525.18 → 527.86] And you can read about their story and the connections.
[528.78 → 530.78] Also, their contact information is there,
[530.92 → 533.90] so feel free to call them and drop in,
[534.14 → 537.62] and they're eager to meet all of us and get to know people,
[537.96 → 539.54] and their English is good.
[540.06 → 541.44] So it makes it a lot easier.
[541.82 → 544.84] So welcome to Canada and to Delta.
[545.42 → 545.78] Thank you.
[546.48 → 547.02] Thank you.
[568.02 → 571.12] Our call to worship comes from Psalm 46.
[571.12 → 574.78] God is our refuge and strength,
[575.24 → 577.88] always ready to help in times of trouble.
[578.12 → 580.36] So we will not fear,
[580.80 → 582.84] even if earthquakes come
[582.84 → 585.82] and the mountains crumble into the sea.
[586.48 → 589.30] Let the oceans roar and foam.
[589.90 → 592.88] Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge.
[592.88 → 604.54] God greets us with these words.
[604.54 → 611.38] Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
[611.38 → 613.38] Please stand.
[613.38 → 613.66] Please stand.
[614.66 → 616.28] And as God has greeted us,
[616.56 → 618.54] raise a hand of greeting to those around you,
[618.88 → 621.10] whether in the sanctuary or at home.
[621.10 → 627.66] 管 cancel music,
[627.66 → 632.78] and the mountains Бог the Lord for it.
[632.78 → 634.64] The๊wan do not feel free to hear from the Hans rumen
[634.64 → 636.76] from lurid way as the approaches to their MOS popper feet from our ground.
[636.76 → 637.86] At last, we may not be able to enjoy our sins.

[684.38 → 693.76] O seed of Israel's chosen race, now ransomed from the fall,
[694.34 → 704.56] Hail him who saved you by his grace and crown him Lord of all.
[704.56 → 716.56] Hail him who saved you by his grace and crown him Lord of all.

[724.56 → 736.56] To him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.
[736.56 → 747.56] To him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.

[822.72 → 826.98] Let all the earth rejoice
[826.98 → 831.58] He wraps himself in light
[831.58 → 837.44] And darkness tries to hide
[837.44 → 840.46] And trembles at his voice
[840.46 → 844.58] And trembles at his voice
[844.58 → 849.54] How great is our love

[979.68 → 984.14] How great is our God
[984.14 → 986.14] And all will see
[986.14 → 989.14] How great is our God
[989.14 → 994.14] How great is our God
[994.14 → 1020.00] We are a moment
[1020.00 → 1022.78] You are forever
[1022.78 → 1026.24] Lord of all the ages
[1026.24 → 1030.10] God before time
[1030.10 → 1032.52] We are a vapour

[1049.82 → 1054.66] Worthy is the Lamb
[1054.66 → 1056.96] Who was slain
[1056.96 → 1059.56] High as His praises
[1059.56 → 1062.56] Honour and glory
[1062.56 → 1068.20] Be unto your name

[1091.60 → 1094.02] We'll sing forever
[1094.02 → 1097.76] Bowing before you
[1097.76 → 1101.88] Blessing your name
[1101.88 → 1107.34] Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1107.34 → 1107.92] Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1107.92 → 1112.62] Worthy is the Lamb
[1112.62 → 1115.04] Who was slain
[1115.04 → 1121.02] I ask praises, honour and glory
[1121.02 → 1128.48] Be unto your name
[1128.48 → 1128.76] Be unto your word
[1128.76 → 1133.46] Be unto your name
[1133.46 → 1134.86] Be unto your name
[1134.86 → 1135.76] Be unto your name
[1135.76 → 1138.02] Be unto your name
[1138.06 → 1138.48] あり unto your name
[1138.48 → 1142.98] Be unto your name
[1142.98 → 1149.98] the lamb who was slain the highest praises
[1149.98 → 1153.98] honour and glory
[1153.98 → 1159.98] be unto your name
[1159.98 → 1169.98] be unto your name
[1169.98 → 1174.98] you may be seated
[1174.98 → 1179.98] today we recognize the Protestant Reformation
[1179.98 → 1183.98] 503 years ago on October 31st
[1183.98 → 1191.98] 1517 Martin Luther nailed 95 objections to the church door in Wittenberg Germany
[1191.98 → 1195.98] protesting the rituals of the Catholic Church
[1195.98 → 1199.98] which marked the beginning of the Protestant Reformation
[1199.98 → 1203.98] this religious upheaval splintered Catholic Europe
[1203.98 → 1209.98] reformers like Martin Luther and later Ulrich Zwingli and John Calvin
[1209.98 → 1217.98] challenged the authority of the Pope and questioned the Catholic Church's ability to define Christian practice
[1217.98 → 1221.98] this was not a peaceful era in Europe
[1221.98 → 1223.98] this movement triggered war
[1223.98 → 1227.98] wars and persecutions for decades
[1227.98 → 1230.98] for both Catholics and Protestants
[1230.98 → 1235.98] Martin Luther's main message was from Ephesians 2
[1235.98 → 1239.98] for it is by grace you have been saved through faith
[1239.98 → 1242.98] and this is not from yourselves
[1242.98 → 1244.98] it is the gift of God
[1244.98 → 1245.98] not by works
[1245.98 → 1248.98] so that no one can boast
[1248.98 → 1251.98] let us offer a prayer
[1251.98 → 1253.98] for our own
[1253.98 → 1255.98] reformation
[1255.98 → 1257.98] let us pray
[1257.98 → 1260.98] reforming God
[1260.98 → 1263.98] we give you thanks for your forgiveness
[1263.98 → 1264.98] and you're blessing
[1264.98 → 1266.98] we pray
[1266.98 → 1268.98] for ourselves
[1268.98 → 1270.98] and your church throughout the world
[1270.98 → 1273.98] fill us with a spirit of openness
[1273.98 → 1274.98] to your spirit
[1274.98 → 1278.98] to hear and receive your promises
[1278.98 → 1280.98] and to keep our covenant with you
[1280.98 → 1283.98] where we are corrupt
[1283.98 → 1284.98] purify us
[1284.98 → 1287.98] where we are in error
[1287.98 → 1289.98] direct us
[1289.98 → 1291.98] where we are in need
[1291.98 → 1293.98] provide for us
[1293.98 → 1295.98] where we are divided
[1295.98 → 1297.98] reunite us
[1297.98 → 1299.98] and where we are closed-minded
[1299.98 → 1300.98] reform us
[1300.98 → 1302.98] and make us new
[1302.98 → 1304.98] we pray in Jesus name
[1304.98 → 1307.98] amen
[1307.98 → 1309.98] hear these words of assurance
[1309.98 → 1312.98] be still and know the good news
[1312.98 → 1314.98] God has not forsaken
[1314.98 → 1315.98] or forgotten us
[1315.98 → 1317.98] but redeems us
[1317.98 → 1319.98] why should we be afraid
[1319.98 → 1322.98] God is in our midst
[1322.98 → 1323.98] forgiving
[1323.98 → 1324.98] restoring
[1324.98 → 1325.98] sending
[1325.98 → 1327.98] thanks be to God
[1327.98 → 1328.98] amen
[1328.98 → 1333.98] Martin Luther was not only a professor of theology
[1333.98 → 1335.98] a Bible translator
[1335.98 → 1337.98] a prolific writer and preacher
[1337.98 → 1339.98] he also composed hymns
[1339.98 → 1343.98] the best known is a mighty fortress is our God
[1343.98 → 1345.98] based on Psalm 46
[1345.98 → 1348.98] which he wrote in 1529
[1348.98 → 1352.98] history tells us that this hymn
[1352.98 → 1355.98] was sung by armies going into battle
[1355.98 → 1359.98] and by Protestants as they were driven into exile
[1359.98 → 1362.98] let's stand as we sing this
[1362.98 → 1366.98] a mighty fortress is our God
[1366.98 → 1383.36] A mighty fortress is our God,
[1383.36 → 1387.40] a bowward never failing.
[1389.08 → 1393.72] Our helper the amid the flood
[1393.72 → 1398.72] of mortal ills prevailing.
[1399.50 → 1403.94] For still our ancient foe
[1403.94 → 1408.14] will seek to work us whole.
[1408.14 → 1412.42] His craft and power are great
[1412.42 → 1416.92] and armed with cruel hate.
[1417.26 → 1421.44] On earth is not his equal.
[1423.72 → 1428.90] Did we in our own strength confide,
[1429.00 → 1434.02] our striving would be no same.
[1434.02 → 1439.26] Were not the right man on our side,
[1439.36 → 1443.28] the man of God's own chosen.
[1443.28 → 1448.46] You ask who that may be,
[1448.46 → 1453.58] for Jesus it is he.
[1453.58 → 1457.58] Lord, Sabbath, his name,
[1457.58 → 1461.58] from age to age the same,
[1461.58 → 1467.76] and he must win the battle.
[1467.76 → 1474.72] And though this world with devils filled
[1474.72 → 1480.20] should threaten to undo us,
[1480.20 → 1485.20] we will not fear for God has will
[1485.20 → 1490.38] his truth to triumph to us.
[1490.38 → 1495.50] The Prince of darkness grim,
[1495.50 → 1499.50] we tremble not for him.
[1499.50 → 1504.68] His reach we can endure,
[1504.68 → 1509.00] for though his doom is sure,
[1509.00 → 1515.30] one little word shall found him.
[1515.30 → 1522.38] Heave him,
[1522.38 → 1524.64] With my name,
[1524.64 → 1525.90] O church and God get Bye,
[1525.90 → 1527.12] God be a Noe for his thanks
[1527.12 → 1532.12] to him for his and for his repentance.
[1532.12 → 1537.62] Close me with them that gifts our hearts
[1537.62 → 1541.72] To it will be the sun
[1541.72 → 1546.36] The peace of the kingdom
[1546.36 → 1552.02] Is brought to life a soul
[1552.02 → 1556.62] The glory they may give
[1556.62 → 1560.50] God's truth abide itself
[1560.50 → 1590.48] The peace of the kingdom
[1590.48 → 1597.18] So welcome again to you all, Area family
[1597.18 → 1601.40] And I was just thinking that perhaps
[1601.40 → 1605.42] The way we worship here in Canada is different
[1605.42 → 1607.02] From what you're used to
[1607.02 → 1609.96] And I'm just hoping that we can learn from you
[1609.96 → 1613.12] About how to worship God in some ways
[1613.12 → 1614.88] And I hope that you will feel at home
[1614.88 → 1616.40] And that you can be yourselves
[1616.40 → 1622.36] So we are going to continue our worship series today
[1622.36 → 1623.42] In the book of Acts
[1623.42 → 1625.74] In a series called The Church and Movement
[1625.74 → 1627.34] We're looking to the early church
[1627.34 → 1630.94] To learn what it means to be a church
[1630.94 → 1632.14] That's following Jesus
[1632.14 → 1634.38] Out into the world
[1634.38 → 1636.36] To proclaim the gospel
[1636.36 → 1639.64] And so today we will continue
[1639.64 → 1641.54] We'll be reading Acts chapter 9
[1641.54 → 1642.66] Verses 1 to 19
[1642.66 → 1647.92] And this is often just kind of known as
[1647.92 → 1649.24] Saul's conversion
[1649.24 → 1652.52] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word
[1652.52 → 1653.56] And I'll read it for us
[1653.56 → 1658.62] Meanwhile Saul, who was still breathing out
[1658.62 → 1660.80] Murderous threats against the Lord's disciples
[1660.80 → 1662.94] He went to the high priest
[1662.94 → 1666.36] And asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus
[1666.36 → 1669.38] So that if he found any there
[1669.38 → 1670.96] Who belonged to the way
[1670.96 → 1672.66] Whether men or women
[1672.66 → 1676.14] He might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem
[1676.14 → 1679.54] As he neared Damascus on his journey
[1679.54 → 1681.26] Suddenly a light from heaven
[1681.26 → 1682.88] Flashed around him
[1682.88 → 1684.64] He fell to the ground
[1684.64 → 1686.22] And heard a voice say to him
[1686.22 → 1689.58] Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
[1690.58 → 1691.92] Who are you, Lord?
[1692.64 → 1693.36] Saul asked
[1693.36 → 1695.66] I am Jesus
[1695.66 → 1697.70] Whom you are persecuting
[1697.70 → 1698.74] He replied
[1698.74 → 1701.18] Now get up and go into the city
[1701.18 → 1704.04] And you will be told what you must do
[1704.04 → 1706.92] The men travelling with Saul
[1706.92 → 1707.98] Stood there speechless
[1707.98 → 1710.00] They heard the sound
[1710.00 → 1711.70] But did not see anyone
[1711.70 → 1713.98] Saul got up from the ground
[1713.98 → 1715.62] But when he opened his eyes
[1715.62 → 1716.48] He could see nothing
[1716.48 → 1718.62] So they led him by the hand
[1718.62 → 1719.74] Into Damascus
[1719.74 → 1722.56] For three days he was blind
[1722.56 → 1724.92] And did not eat or drink anything
[1724.92 → 1726.58] In Damascus
[1726.58 → 1728.76] There was a disciple named Ananias
[1728.76 → 1731.16] The Lord called to him in a vision
[1731.16 → 1732.60] Ananias
[1732.60 → 1734.12] Yes, Lord
[1734.12 → 1734.96] He answered
[1734.96 → 1736.98] The Lord told him
[1736.98 → 1738.56] Go to the house of Judas
[1738.56 → 1739.64] On Straight Street
[1739.64 → 1741.20] And ask for a man
[1741.20 → 1741.94] From Tarsus
[1741.94 → 1742.62] Named Saul
[1742.62 → 1744.06] For he is praying
[1744.06 → 1746.18] In a vision
[1746.18 → 1747.70] He has seen a man
[1747.70 → 1748.92] Named Ananias
[1748.92 → 1750.14] Come and place his hands
[1750.14 → 1750.60] On him
[1750.60 → 1751.92] To restore his sight
[1751.92 → 1753.84] Lord
[1753.84 → 1754.98] Ananias answered
[1754.98 → 1756.86] I have heard many reports
[1756.86 → 1757.68] About this man
[1757.68 → 1758.78] And all the harm
[1758.78 → 1759.52] He has done
[1759.52 → 1760.62] To your holy people
[1760.62 → 1761.16] In Jerusalem
[1761.16 → 1763.18] And he has come here
[1763.18 → 1763.96] With authority
[1763.96 → 1765.14] From the chief priests
[1765.14 → 1766.64] To arrest all
[1766.64 → 1767.30] Who call
[1767.30 → 1768.30] On your name
[1768.30 → 1770.28] But the Lord
[1770.28 → 1771.42] Said to Ananias
[1771.42 → 1772.14] Go
[1772.14 → 1773.70] This man
[1773.70 → 1774.34] Is my
[1774.34 → 1775.48] Chosen instrument
[1775.48 → 1776.78] To proclaim
[1776.78 → 1777.48] My name
[1777.48 → 1778.32] To the Gentiles
[1778.32 → 1779.12] And their kings
[1779.12 → 1779.82] And to the people
[1779.82 → 1780.32] Of Israel
[1780.32 → 1781.96] I will show him
[1781.96 → 1782.58] How much
[1782.58 → 1783.44] He must suffer
[1783.44 → 1784.62] For my name
[1784.62 → 1786.96] Then Ananias
[1786.96 → 1787.80] Went to the house
[1787.80 → 1788.86] And entered it
[1788.86 → 1790.26] Placing his hands
[1790.26 → 1790.84] On Saul
[1790.84 → 1791.40] He said
[1791.40 → 1792.50] Brother Saul
[1792.50 → 1793.84] The Lord
[1793.84 → 1794.34] Jesus
[1794.34 → 1796.06] Who appeared to you
[1796.06 → 1796.82] On the road
[1796.82 → 1797.98] As you were coming here
[1797.98 → 1799.24] Has sent me
[1799.24 → 1800.90] So that you may see again
[1800.90 → 1801.52] And be filled
[1801.52 → 1802.34] With the Holy Spirit
[1802.34 → 1803.94] Immediately
[1803.94 → 1805.24] Something like scales
[1805.24 → 1806.54] Fell from Saul's eyes
[1806.54 → 1808.18] And he could see again
[1808.18 → 1809.22] He got up
[1809.22 → 1810.04] And was baptized
[1810.04 → 1812.22] And after taking some food
[1812.22 → 1813.54] He regained his strength
[1813.54 → 1815.96] Saul spent several days
[1815.96 → 1816.82] With the disciples
[1816.82 → 1818.38] In Damascus
[1818.38 → 1820.52] This is the word
[1820.52 → 1820.98] Of the Lord
[1820.98 → 1822.66] Thanks be to God
[1822.66 → 1823.70] Let's pray together
[1823.70 → 1827.48] Father we
[1827.48 → 1829.06] Come before you
[1829.06 → 1829.96] As your people
[1829.96 → 1831.88] And Lord I pray
[1831.88 → 1832.66] That you would
[1832.66 → 1834.22] Help us to hear your voice
[1834.22 → 1834.86] Lord I pray
[1834.86 → 1835.80] That you would help me
[1835.80 → 1837.82] As I speak
[1837.82 → 1838.64] Lord even that
[1838.64 → 1839.48] Through my weakness
[1839.48 → 1840.22] And my sin
[1840.22 → 1841.62] That you would
[1841.62 → 1842.92] Use me as your
[1842.92 → 1843.68] Chosen instrument
[1843.68 → 1846.26] And Lord grant all of us
[1846.26 → 1848.04] The Holy Spirit's help
[1848.04 → 1849.90] To hear your word
[1849.90 → 1852.40] And we pray in Jesus name
[1852.40 → 1853.22] Amen
[1853.22 → 1854.70] And friends
[1854.70 → 1855.68] Would you in the back
[1855.68 → 1856.70] Turn down my mic
[1856.70 → 1858.22] I feel like it's very loud
[1858.22 → 1860.00] Just a bit
[1860.00 → 1861.06] Thanks
[1861.06 → 1864.84] So
[1864.84 → 1866.14] There is a
[1866.14 → 1867.00] Small village
[1867.00 → 1868.08] In southern France
[1868.08 → 1869.06] Called
[1869.06 → 1869.96] Le Carbon
[1869.96 → 1871.20] I should have asked my
[1871.20 → 1872.08] My kids in French
[1872.08 → 1872.74] How to pronounce that
[1872.74 → 1873.14] Correctly
[1873.14 → 1873.34] But
[1873.34 → 1874.50] Le Carbon
[1874.50 → 1874.88] Or something
[1874.88 → 1877.70] And so over the past
[1877.70 → 1879.02] Several hundred years
[1879.02 → 1879.96] Really even since
[1879.96 → 1881.14] The time of the Reformation
[1881.14 → 1882.58] This population
[1882.58 → 1883.68] Has only ever been
[1883.68 → 1885.10] Around 2 or 3 thousand people
[1885.10 → 1887.36] Even up to today
[1887.36 → 1888.16] If you go there now
[1888.16 → 1888.88] There would only be
[1888.88 → 1889.36] You know
[1889.36 → 1890.28] It's a small village
[1890.28 → 1891.44] Of about 2 thousand people
[1891.44 → 1893.18] And while it's an
[1893.18 → 1894.22] Ordinary village
[1894.22 → 1894.94] In France
[1894.94 → 1896.74] One thing that is
[1896.74 → 1897.46] Unusual
[1897.46 → 1898.90] Is that it is a place
[1898.90 → 1899.88] Where persecuted
[1899.88 → 1901.14] Religious minorities
[1901.14 → 1902.26] Had gathered
[1902.26 → 1904.22] And in France
[1904.22 → 1905.96] During the time
[1905.96 → 1906.82] Of the Reformation
[1906.82 → 1908.38] And this is Catholic France
[1908.38 → 1910.60] The minority religious group
[1910.60 → 1911.70] Were who?
[1913.02 → 1913.84] They were Protestants
[1913.84 → 1914.90] They were the reformed
[1914.90 → 1915.60] Calvinist
[1915.60 → 1917.60] Protestant Christians
[1917.60 → 1918.78] Called the Huguenots
[1918.78 → 1920.60] But otherwise
[1920.60 → 1921.70] It's a regular
[1921.70 → 1923.10] Ordinary French village
[1923.10 → 1925.78] But December 1940
[1925.78 → 1927.06] After France
[1927.06 → 1928.24] Had surrendered to Germany
[1928.24 → 1929.30] In World War II
[1929.30 → 1930.76] The residents
[1930.76 → 1931.86] Of this little village
[1931.86 → 1932.88] Started seeing
[1932.88 → 1933.96] Strangers
[1933.96 → 1935.44] Come through
[1935.44 → 1937.02] Their remote village
[1937.02 → 1939.22] And seeing
[1939.22 → 1940.62] These weary travellers
[1940.62 → 1941.60] The villagers
[1941.60 → 1943.44] Started to welcome them
[1943.44 → 1944.60] Into their homes
[1944.60 → 1946.48] They started to offer them
[1946.48 → 1947.80] Food and shelter
[1947.80 → 1949.98] Just being very generous
[1949.98 → 1950.56] With this
[1950.56 → 1951.46] With a kind of
[1951.46 → 1952.22] Ordinary
[1952.22 → 1953.04] Humble
[1953.04 → 1954.66] Hospitality
[1954.66 → 1956.68] Before long
[1956.68 → 1957.38] They discovered
[1957.38 → 1958.22] That these weren't
[1958.22 → 1959.52] Just ordinary travellers
[1959.52 → 1960.56] Who happened
[1960.56 → 1961.60] To be passing through
[1961.60 → 1963.00] These were Jews
[1963.00 → 1964.46] Who were fleeing
[1964.46 → 1965.28] Nazi Germany
[1965.28 → 1968.20] And just drawing
[1968.20 → 1969.30] From their deeply
[1969.30 → 1969.96] Held
[1969.96 → 1971.24] Biblical convictions
[1971.24 → 1973.24] Over a period
[1973.24 → 1973.94] Of four years
[1973.94 → 1974.68] These Protestant
[1974.68 → 1975.66] Country villagers
[1975.66 → 1977.76] Quietly defied
[1977.76 → 1978.56] The laws
[1978.56 → 1979.44] Of this new
[1979.44 → 1980.26] Nazi regime
[1980.26 → 1981.54] And they saved
[1981.54 → 1983.54] Nearly 5,000 lives
[1983.54 → 1984.86] Many of whom
[1984.86 → 1985.68] Were children
[1985.68 → 1987.98] And it was
[1987.98 → 1988.54] Through this
[1988.54 → 1989.24] Just simple
[1989.24 → 1990.74] But subversive
[1990.74 → 1991.38] Act
[1991.38 → 1992.80] Of fearless
[1992.80 → 1993.48] Welcome
[1993.48 → 1995.02] That they did this
[1995.02 → 1995.52] And actually
[1995.52 → 1996.48] I was reading
[1996.48 → 1996.92] About this
[1996.92 → 1997.52] On Wikipedia
[1997.52 → 1998.98] And the whole village
[1998.98 → 1999.86] Won some
[1999.86 → 2000.72] Humanitarian
[2000.72 → 2002.14] Prize
[2002.14 → 2003.84] For their work
[2003.84 → 2005.34] In this
[2005.34 → 2007.24] And so
[2007.24 → 2007.98] One former
[2007.98 → 2008.96] Child refugee
[2008.96 → 2011.10] Recalled those days
[2011.10 → 2011.68] And this is what
[2011.68 → 2012.16] She said
[2012.16 → 2014.16] Nobody asked
[2014.16 → 2014.84] Who was Jewish
[2014.84 → 2015.76] And who was not
[2015.76 → 2018.20] Nobody asked
[2018.20 → 2020.30] Where you were from
[2020.30 → 2022.50] Nobody asked you
[2022.50 → 2023.74] Who your father was
[2023.74 → 2025.34] Or if you could pay
[2025.34 → 2027.68] They just accepted
[2027.68 → 2028.70] Each of us
[2028.70 → 2030.40] Taking us in
[2030.40 → 2031.56] With warmth
[2031.56 → 2033.14] And I think
[2033.14 → 2034.14] It's a remarkable
[2034.14 → 2035.08] Story about the
[2035.08 → 2036.88] Power of hospitality
[2036.88 → 2039.24] And in the same way
[2039.24 → 2039.82] The passage
[2039.82 → 2041.04] That we come to
[2041.04 → 2041.74] Today
[2041.74 → 2043.24] Is a passage
[2043.24 → 2044.58] That highlights
[2044.58 → 2046.72] An act
[2046.72 → 2047.74] Of fearless
[2047.74 → 2048.18] Welcome
[2048.18 → 2049.68] And so
[2049.68 → 2050.26] We're introduced
[2050.26 → 2050.88] To a man
[2050.88 → 2051.84] Named Ananias
[2051.84 → 2052.72] And this is the
[2052.72 → 2053.54] First time we read
[2053.54 → 2053.96] About him
[2053.96 → 2054.94] In the story of Acts
[2054.94 → 2055.86] And it's the last
[2055.86 → 2056.56] Time we're going to
[2056.56 → 2057.66] Hear from him
[2057.66 → 2059.46] And one commentator
[2059.46 → 2060.08] Said he's kind of
[2060.08 → 2060.72] Like this guy
[2060.72 → 2061.44] In the orchestra
[2061.44 → 2062.70] Who plays the
[2062.70 → 2063.30] Symbols
[2063.30 → 2064.94] And he has that
[2064.94 → 2066.04] One note to play
[2066.04 → 2066.70] In the entire
[2066.70 → 2067.10] Symphony
[2067.10 → 2068.08] And he's just
[2068.08 → 2068.74] Kind of waiting
[2068.74 → 2069.46] And waiting
[2069.46 → 2070.20] And when the
[2070.20 → 2070.76] Moment come
[2070.76 → 2071.52] He clashes
[2071.52 → 2072.02] His symbols
[2072.02 → 2072.44] Together
[2072.44 → 2073.70] He plays his
[2073.70 → 2074.06] Note
[2074.06 → 2075.32] And he's done
[2075.32 → 2077.66] And this is the
[2077.66 → 2078.30] Only thing
[2078.30 → 2079.22] Ananias does
[2079.22 → 2079.64] In the whole
[2079.64 → 2080.08] Bible
[2080.08 → 2081.44] And then he
[2081.44 → 2082.42] Completely disappears
[2082.42 → 2083.06] From the scene
[2083.06 → 2083.82] And we never
[2083.82 → 2084.38] Hear from him
[2084.38 → 2084.68] Again
[2084.68 → 2086.50] And yet what we
[2086.50 → 2087.34] See in Acts
[2087.34 → 2087.96] Chapter 9
[2087.96 → 2089.08] Is that Ananias
[2089.08 → 2090.38] Is a remarkable
[2090.38 → 2090.86] Person
[2090.86 → 2092.50] And that he
[2092.50 → 2093.60] Has been formed
[2093.60 → 2095.76] Deeply by the
[2095.76 → 2097.00] Gospel of grace
[2097.00 → 2099.54] And that it's
[2099.54 → 2100.36] Through his
[2100.36 → 2101.30] Kind of ordinary
[2101.30 → 2102.78] Welcome
[2102.78 → 2104.02] And love
[2104.02 → 2105.96] It's a welcome
[2105.96 → 2106.58] That is filled
[2106.58 → 2107.34] With faith
[2107.34 → 2108.32] And fearless
[2108.32 → 2109.10] Obedience to
[2109.10 → 2109.40] God
[2109.40 → 2110.94] He ends up
[2110.94 → 2111.96] Doing a great
[2111.96 → 2112.70] Thing here
[2112.70 → 2113.94] And so
[2113.94 → 2114.56] This morning
[2114.56 → 2115.04] I just want us
[2115.04 → 2115.60] To look at this
[2115.60 → 2115.96] Together
[2115.96 → 2116.84] And we're
[2116.84 → 2117.68] Basically asking
[2117.68 → 2118.44] How does the
[2118.44 → 2119.38] Gospel create
[2119.38 → 2120.70] People like
[2120.70 → 2121.46] Ananias
[2121.46 → 2123.04] How does the
[2123.04 → 2123.76] Gospel create
[2123.76 → 2124.34] People like
[2124.34 → 2125.12] Those villagers
[2125.12 → 2126.90] In Le Carbon
[2126.90 → 2128.64] And what does
[2128.64 → 2129.38] It means to us
[2129.38 → 2129.92] As a Christian
[2129.92 → 2130.48] Community
[2130.48 → 2131.70] To practice
[2131.70 → 2132.88] This kind of
[2132.88 → 2134.54] Fearless welcome
[2134.54 → 2135.70] To any
[2135.70 → 2136.48] Who would
[2136.48 → 2137.58] Come and
[2137.58 → 2137.98] Seek
[2137.98 → 2139.02] Refuge
[2139.02 → 2140.46] And so
[2140.46 → 2140.84] Let's look at
[2140.84 → 2141.28] This passage
[2141.28 → 2141.66] And I just
[2141.66 → 2142.16] Want us to look
[2142.16 → 2142.76] At two kinds of
[2142.76 → 2143.46] Main things here
[2143.46 → 2144.28] First the risk
[2144.28 → 2144.82] Of welcome
[2144.82 → 2145.96] And secondly
[2145.96 → 2146.64] The grace of
[2146.64 → 2146.92] Welcome
[2146.92 → 2147.78] Okay the risk
[2147.78 → 2148.18] Of welcome
[2148.18 → 2148.74] The grace of
[2148.74 → 2148.98] Welcome
[2148.98 → 2150.44] So first the risk
[2150.44 → 2152.26] In verse 10
[2152.26 → 2153.26] God appears
[2153.26 → 2153.98] To Ananias
[2153.98 → 2154.44] In a vision
[2154.44 → 2155.94] And it really
[2155.94 → 2156.78] Reminds me of
[2156.78 → 2157.58] Samuel from
[2157.58 → 2158.32] The Old Testament
[2158.32 → 2159.50] You know remember
[2159.50 → 2160.22] Samuel he
[2160.22 → 2161.04] He heard
[2161.04 → 2162.06] God speaking
[2162.06 → 2162.78] And he said
[2162.78 → 2164.28] Here I am
[2164.28 → 2164.66] Lord
[2164.66 → 2166.02] Speak Lord
[2166.02 → 2166.82] For your servant
[2166.82 → 2167.68] Is listening
[2167.68 → 2168.76] And so there's
[2168.76 → 2169.82] This familiarity
[2169.82 → 2171.56] He hears the
[2171.56 → 2172.38] Voice of God
[2172.38 → 2174.24] And he responds
[2174.24 → 2175.92] And this is
[2175.92 → 2176.34] Very much
[2176.34 → 2176.72] Kind of like
[2176.72 → 2177.18] John
[2177.18 → 2178.82] 10 27
[2178.82 → 2179.98] Which says
[2179.98 → 2180.68] My sheep
[2180.68 → 2181.96] Hear my voice
[2181.96 → 2183.44] And I know
[2183.44 → 2183.88] Them
[2183.88 → 2184.80] And they
[2184.80 → 2185.58] Follow me
[2185.58 → 2188.34] When Jesus
[2188.34 → 2189.04] Appears to
[2189.04 → 2189.38] Saul
[2189.38 → 2189.78] He's
[2189.78 → 2190.18] You know
[2190.18 → 2190.86] To Saul
[2190.86 → 2191.90] In contrast
[2191.90 → 2192.16] Right
[2192.16 → 2192.90] Saul says
[2192.90 → 2193.96] Who are you
[2193.96 → 2194.28] Lord
[2194.28 → 2196.06] But when
[2196.06 → 2197.46] Jesus
[2197.46 → 2198.32] Or God
[2198.32 → 2199.62] Speaks and
[2199.62 → 2200.14] Appears to
[2200.14 → 2200.84] Ananias
[2200.84 → 2201.46] Ananias
[2201.46 → 2201.70] Says
[2201.70 → 2202.74] Here I
[2202.74 → 2203.28] Am
[2203.28 → 2204.14] Lord
[2204.14 → 2205.38] And I think
[2205.38 → 2205.80] There's this
[2205.80 → 2206.96] Incredible intimacy
[2206.96 → 2208.26] And familiarity
[2208.26 → 2209.18] That we should
[2209.18 → 2210.22] All long for
[2210.22 → 2211.64] And so the
[2211.64 → 2212.14] Question is
[2212.14 → 2212.68] Do you know
[2212.68 → 2213.50] Jesus' voice
[2213.50 → 2214.04] When it comes
[2214.04 → 2214.82] I wonder if
[2214.82 → 2215.04] You know
[2215.04 → 2215.60] God suddenly
[2215.60 → 2216.26] Spoke to me
[2216.26 → 2216.96] If I would
[2216.96 → 2217.48] Just be like
[2217.48 → 2218.48] You know
[2218.48 → 2218.92] What
[2218.92 → 2220.00] Who's talking
[2220.00 → 2221.00] And you know
[2221.00 → 2221.64] Be completely
[2221.64 → 2222.60] Shocked
[2222.60 → 2225.24] So the question
[2225.24 → 2226.00] Is do you know
[2226.00 → 2226.72] How to discern
[2226.72 → 2227.54] His voice
[2227.54 → 2229.20] Especially
[2229.20 → 2230.20] Out of the
[2230.20 → 2230.98] Many voices
[2230.98 → 2231.74] That are always
[2231.74 → 2232.64] Vying for our
[2232.64 → 2233.60] Heart's affections
[2233.60 → 2235.26] Now notice
[2235.26 → 2235.92] What God
[2235.92 → 2236.70] Is asking
[2236.70 → 2237.24] Ananias
[2237.24 → 2237.56] To do
[2237.56 → 2237.78] Here
[2237.78 → 2238.06] And it
[2238.06 → 2238.72] Is completely
[2238.72 → 2239.32] Astounding
[2239.32 → 2240.52] And if you
[2240.52 → 2240.76] Look at
[2240.76 → 2241.36] Verse 11
[2241.36 → 2241.80] We see
[2241.80 → 2242.64] This command
[2242.64 → 2243.08] That God
[2243.08 → 2243.48] Gives to
[2243.48 → 2243.64] Him
[2243.64 → 2244.90] And what's
[2244.90 → 2245.32] Interesting
[2245.32 → 2246.02] Is that the
[2246.02 → 2246.96] Greek sentence
[2246.96 → 2247.56] Structure
[2247.56 → 2248.96] Is built
[2248.96 → 2249.46] In such a
[2249.46 → 2250.02] Way that as
[2250.02 → 2250.62] God talks
[2250.62 → 2251.34] To Ananias
[2251.34 → 2252.04] The drama
[2252.04 → 2252.50] Kind of
[2252.50 → 2253.06] Builds up
[2253.06 → 2253.84] And each
[2253.84 → 2254.74] Command that
[2254.74 → 2255.46] He says
[2255.46 → 2256.20] Just kind of
[2256.20 → 2256.74] Builds and
[2256.74 → 2257.24] Builds
[2257.24 → 2258.12] And our
[2258.12 → 2259.10] NIV kind of
[2259.10 → 2259.62] Switches the
[2259.62 → 2260.12] Words around
[2260.12 → 2261.54] So it doesn't
[2261.54 → 2262.10] Kind of pull
[2262.10 → 2262.68] Out this
[2262.68 → 2263.42] Drama from
[2263.42 → 2264.20] The Greek
[2264.20 → 2265.06] But the
[2265.06 → 2266.10] ESV
[2266.10 → 2266.56] The English
[2266.56 → 2267.18] Standard Version
[2267.18 → 2267.74] Follows the
[2267.74 → 2268.28] Greek closely
[2268.28 → 2269.56] So I'll put
[2269.56 → 2270.18] That verse on
[2270.18 → 2270.56] The screen
[2270.56 → 2271.04] For us
[2271.04 → 2272.42] And this is
[2272.42 → 2273.02] What it says
[2273.02 → 2274.24] Rise
[2274.24 → 2275.88] And go to
[2275.88 → 2276.28] The street
[2276.28 → 2276.92] Called straight
[2276.92 → 2278.00] And at the
[2278.00 → 2278.36] House of
[2278.36 → 2278.76] Judas
[2278.76 → 2279.64] Look for a
[2279.64 → 2280.10] Man of
[2280.10 → 2280.68] Tarsus
[2280.68 → 2281.80] Named Saul
[2281.80 → 2282.80] Okay so
[2282.80 → 2283.58] Let's think
[2283.58 → 2284.08] About this
[2284.08 → 2284.78] So God
[2284.78 → 2285.16] Says
[2285.16 → 2285.86] Rise
[2285.86 → 2287.00] And we can
[2287.00 → 2287.36] Imagine
[2287.36 → 2288.12] Ananias
[2288.12 → 2288.72] Saying
[2288.72 → 2289.78] Okay here
[2289.78 → 2290.02] Lord
[2290.02 → 2290.64] I'm here
[2290.64 → 2291.16] I'm ready
[2291.16 → 2292.74] What would
[2292.74 → 2293.08] You have
[2293.08 → 2293.50] Me do
[2293.50 → 2294.84] And God
[2294.84 → 2295.26] Says
[2295.26 → 2296.18] Go to
[2296.18 → 2296.58] The street
[2296.58 → 2297.30] Called straight
[2297.30 → 2298.42] You know
[2298.42 → 2299.14] And Ananias
[2299.14 → 2299.52] Might say
[2299.52 → 2300.32] Okay I know
[2300.32 → 2300.58] Where that
[2300.58 → 2300.86] Is
[2300.86 → 2302.66] And on
[2302.66 → 2303.10] That street
[2303.10 → 2303.56] There's a
[2303.56 → 2303.98] House of
[2303.98 → 2304.24] A man
[2304.24 → 2304.42] Named
[2304.42 → 2304.88] Judas
[2304.88 → 2306.50] Okay I
[2306.50 → 2306.92] Think I
[2306.92 → 2307.18] Know who
[2307.18 → 2307.64] That is
[2307.64 → 2308.00] Judas
[2308.00 → 2310.34] There's a
[2310.34 → 2310.78] Man there
[2310.78 → 2311.58] From Tarsus
[2311.58 → 2313.12] Okay sure
[2313.12 → 2313.68] Tarsus
[2313.68 → 2314.10] That's fine
[2314.10 → 2315.90] His name
[2315.90 → 2316.56] Is Saul
[2316.56 → 2317.94] And then
[2317.94 → 2318.34] You can hear
[2318.34 → 2318.70] Like the
[2318.70 → 2318.98] Record
[2318.98 → 2319.42] Scratching
[2319.42 → 2320.38] You know
[2320.38 → 2321.74] Like what
[2321.74 → 2323.60] Up until
[2323.60 → 2324.08] This point
[2324.08 → 2324.60] Ananias
[2324.60 → 2324.86] Has been
[2324.86 → 2325.26] Saying
[2325.26 → 2326.60] Yes Lord
[2326.60 → 2327.26] Yes Lord
[2327.26 → 2327.80] Yes Lord
[2327.80 → 2328.46] But when
[2328.46 → 2329.14] God gets
[2329.14 → 2329.36] To the
[2329.36 → 2329.86] Final part
[2329.86 → 2330.38] This man's
[2330.38 → 2330.72] Name is
[2330.72 → 2331.28] Saul
[2331.28 → 2332.18] Suddenly
[2332.18 → 2332.94] Ananias
[2332.94 → 2333.36] Is like
[2333.36 → 2334.58] Are you
[2334.58 → 2335.14] Sure
[2335.14 → 2335.90] About this
[2335.90 → 2337.96] Because Saul
[2337.96 → 2338.66] Was the
[2338.66 → 2339.38] Most notorious
[2339.38 → 2340.38] Persecutor
[2340.38 → 2340.92] Of the
[2340.92 → 2341.16] Early
[2341.16 → 2341.64] Christians
[2341.64 → 2342.36] Right
[2342.36 → 2342.62] He was
[2342.62 → 2342.94] The most
[2342.94 → 2343.42] Zealous
[2343.42 → 2344.12] Opponent
[2344.12 → 2345.10] Of this
[2345.10 → 2345.44] New
[2345.44 → 2345.86] Jesus
[2345.86 → 2346.58] Movement
[2346.58 → 2347.36] That was
[2347.36 → 2348.06] Growing
[2348.06 → 2349.24] So in
[2349.24 → 2349.84] Acts chapter
[2349.84 → 2350.32] Seven
[2350.32 → 2351.00] Then Saul
[2351.00 → 2352.04] Is overseeing
[2352.04 → 2352.84] The stoning
[2352.84 → 2354.52] Of Stephen
[2354.52 → 2355.06] Who is the
[2355.06 → 2355.76] First Christian
[2355.76 → 2356.12] Martyr
[2356.12 → 2357.86] He oversees
[2357.86 → 2358.56] His execution
[2358.56 → 2359.66] And the
[2359.66 → 2360.14] Bible says
[2360.14 → 2360.66] He looks
[2360.66 → 2361.08] On it
[2361.08 → 2361.72] With approval
[2361.72 → 2363.28] And then
[2363.28 → 2363.74] In Acts
[2363.74 → 2364.12] Chapter
[2364.12 → 2364.80] Eight
[2364.80 → 2366.08] A great
[2366.08 → 2366.96] Persecution
[2366.96 → 2367.64] Broke out
[2367.64 → 2368.06] Against the
[2368.06 → 2368.42] Church in
[2368.42 → 2368.78] Jerusalem
[2368.78 → 2369.82] Which sends
[2369.82 → 2370.36] Most of the
[2370.36 → 2370.70] Christians
[2370.70 → 2371.28] Fleeing for
[2371.28 → 2371.78] Their lives
[2371.78 → 2372.32] Out into
[2372.32 → 2372.90] The regions
[2372.90 → 2374.08] Of Judea
[2374.08 → 2374.84] And Samaria
[2374.84 → 2375.88] And it
[2375.88 → 2376.22] Says
[2376.22 → 2377.04] Paul began
[2377.04 → 2377.90] To destroy
[2377.90 → 2378.62] The church
[2378.62 → 2379.70] Going
[2379.70 → 2381.06] From house
[2381.06 → 2381.86] To house
[2381.86 → 2383.08] He dragged
[2383.08 → 2383.90] Off both
[2383.90 → 2384.56] Men and
[2384.56 → 2384.84] Women
[2384.84 → 2385.28] And put
[2385.28 → 2385.62] Them in
[2385.62 → 2385.96] Prison
[2385.96 → 2386.64] I mean
[2386.64 → 2386.86] That's
[2386.86 → 2387.42] Intense
[2387.42 → 2389.82] Then in
[2389.82 → 2391.02] Our passage
[2391.02 → 2391.36] We read
[2391.36 → 2391.78] Today in
[2391.78 → 2392.50] Verse one
[2392.50 → 2393.52] We read
[2393.52 → 2395.10] Saul was
[2395.10 → 2396.22] Still breathing
[2396.22 → 2397.78] Out murderous
[2397.78 → 2398.58] Threats
[2398.58 → 2399.22] Against the
[2399.22 → 2399.58] Lord's
[2399.58 → 2400.12] Disciples
[2400.12 → 2401.14] And it's
[2401.14 → 2401.92] This language
[2401.92 → 2402.90] Of breathing
[2402.90 → 2403.94] Out threats
[2403.94 → 2405.06] One commentator
[2405.06 → 2406.00] Said he's
[2406.00 → 2406.58] Being compared
[2406.58 → 2406.94] To a
[2406.94 → 2407.80] Wild animal
[2407.80 → 2409.08] Kind of
[2409.08 → 2410.14] Like snarling
[2410.14 → 2411.14] Or growling
[2411.14 → 2412.62] And so
[2412.62 → 2413.04] It's no
[2413.04 → 2413.92] Exaggeration
[2413.92 → 2414.24] To say
[2414.24 → 2414.82] That Saul
[2414.82 → 2415.56] Of Tarsus
[2415.56 → 2415.92] Was the
[2415.92 → 2416.66] Most feared
[2416.66 → 2417.48] Man in
[2417.48 → 2418.10] His day
[2418.10 → 2418.54] If you
[2418.54 → 2418.84] Were a
[2418.84 → 2419.22] Christian
[2419.22 → 2422.02] And here's
[2422.02 → 2422.46] God
[2422.46 → 2423.86] Asking
[2423.86 → 2424.46] Ordinary
[2424.46 → 2425.32] Ananias
[2425.32 → 2426.28] To go
[2426.28 → 2426.92] To this
[2426.92 → 2427.36] Man
[2427.36 → 2428.62] To lay
[2428.62 → 2429.80] His hands
[2429.80 → 2430.84] On him
[2430.84 → 2431.20] This
[2431.20 → 2432.04] Snarling
[2432.04 → 2432.54] Lion
[2432.54 → 2434.46] To offer
[2434.46 → 2434.88] Him
[2434.88 → 2435.46] Healing
[2435.46 → 2436.32] And welcome
[2436.32 → 2438.46] So then
[2438.46 → 2439.34] Verse 13
[2439.34 → 2439.90] Ananias
[2439.90 → 2440.60] Protests
[2440.60 → 2442.18] And I
[2442.18 → 2442.46] Think it's
[2442.46 → 2442.64] Really
[2442.64 → 2443.10] Interesting
[2443.10 → 2444.02] That Ananias
[2444.02 → 2444.38] He feels
[2444.38 → 2445.12] So comfortable
[2445.12 → 2445.84] With Jesus
[2445.84 → 2446.32] So kind of
[2446.32 → 2446.88] Secure
[2446.88 → 2447.24] In his
[2447.24 → 2447.90] Relationship
[2447.90 → 2448.34] With Jesus
[2448.34 → 2449.08] That he's
[2449.08 → 2449.48] Willing to
[2449.48 → 2449.82] Actually
[2449.82 → 2450.64] Question
[2450.64 → 2451.82] The decision
[2451.82 → 2453.06] He kind of
[2453.06 → 2453.26] Says
[2453.26 → 2453.58] Lord
[2453.58 → 2454.08] Maybe in
[2454.08 → 2454.30] Heaven
[2454.30 → 2454.74] You haven't
[2454.74 → 2454.96] Heard
[2454.96 → 2455.32] About this
[2455.32 → 2455.66] Guy
[2455.66 → 2456.58] But this
[2456.58 → 2457.06] Guy
[2457.06 → 2457.98] Is a
[2457.98 → 2458.24] Bad
[2458.24 → 2458.68] Man
[2458.68 → 2461.04] And so
[2461.04 → 2461.24] In
[2461.24 → 2462.04] Ananias
[2462.04 → 2462.66] There's
[2462.66 → 2462.80] A
[2462.80 → 2463.68] Reluctance
[2463.68 → 2465.16] But there's
[2465.16 → 2465.66] Also a
[2465.66 → 2466.34] Willingness
[2466.34 → 2467.22] To be
[2467.22 → 2467.74] Faithful
[2467.74 → 2468.12] To what
[2468.12 → 2468.40] God
[2468.40 → 2468.84] Has called
[2468.84 → 2468.98] Him
[2468.98 → 2469.38] To do
[2469.38 → 2470.82] And I
[2470.82 → 2471.20] Think there's
[2471.20 → 2471.44] A little
[2471.44 → 2471.84] Lesson
[2471.84 → 2472.14] There
[2472.14 → 2474.40] That sometimes
[2474.40 → 2474.90] When God
[2474.90 → 2475.40] Asks us
[2475.40 → 2475.72] To do
[2475.72 → 2476.08] Something
[2476.08 → 2477.26] We might
[2477.26 → 2477.56] Feel
[2477.56 → 2478.26] Reluctant
[2478.26 → 2479.50] You know
[2479.50 → 2479.88] I might
[2479.88 → 2480.22] Feel
[2480.22 → 2481.40] Unequipped
[2481.40 → 2482.04] I might
[2482.04 → 2482.24] Feel
[2482.24 → 2482.56] Out of
[2482.56 → 2482.72] My
[2482.72 → 2483.30] Depths
[2483.30 → 2484.64] I might
[2484.64 → 2484.84] Feel
[2484.84 → 2485.18] That this
[2485.18 → 2485.50] Kind of
[2485.50 → 2486.32] Just goes
[2486.32 → 2486.84] Against
[2486.84 → 2487.54] What I
[2487.54 → 2488.24] Would
[2488.24 → 2488.50] Prefer
[2488.50 → 2488.94] To do
[2488.94 → 2490.24] But God
[2490.24 → 2490.54] Is not
[2490.54 → 2490.80] Looking
[2490.80 → 2491.10] For
[2491.10 → 2491.76] Ability
[2491.76 → 2492.88] He's
[2492.88 → 2493.18] Looking
[2493.18 → 2493.70] For
[2493.70 → 2494.98] Willingness
[2494.98 → 2496.56] And it's
[2496.56 → 2496.82] Much
[2496.82 → 2497.34] Better
[2497.34 → 2498.28] To be
[2498.28 → 2499.32] Reluctant
[2499.32 → 2500.86] But willing
[2500.86 → 2502.02] Than to
[2502.02 → 2502.38] Have the
[2502.38 → 2502.90] Ability
[2502.90 → 2503.74] But say
[2503.74 → 2504.30] To God
[2504.30 → 2507.44] You know
[2507.44 → 2508.24] Wait
[2508.24 → 2508.72] So I got
[2508.72 → 2509.04] Confused
[2509.04 → 2510.02] To have the
[2510.02 → 2510.32] Ability
[2510.32 → 2510.72] But then
[2510.72 → 2511.10] Not be
[2511.10 → 2511.40] Willing
[2511.40 → 2511.70] To do
[2511.70 → 2511.92] It's
[2511.92 → 2512.16] Much
[2512.16 → 2512.56] Better
[2512.56 → 2513.62] To
[2513.62 → 2514.20] Even if
[2514.20 → 2514.34] We're
[2514.34 → 2514.76] Reluctant
[2514.76 → 2515.06] To say
[2515.06 → 2515.56] God
[2515.56 → 2515.72] God
[2515.72 → 2516.58] I will
[2516.58 → 2516.88] Go
[2516.88 → 2517.44] To say
[2517.44 → 2517.86] Yes
[2517.86 → 2520.00] So Ananias
[2520.00 → 2521.04] Is reluctant
[2521.04 → 2522.14] Understandably
[2522.14 → 2522.92] And he's
[2522.92 → 2523.20] Probably
[2523.20 → 2523.78] Thinking
[2523.78 → 2524.90] Lord
[2524.90 → 2525.48] Remember
[2525.48 → 2525.96] Stephen
[2525.96 → 2527.28] Stephen
[2527.28 → 2527.78] Obeyed
[2527.78 → 2528.02] You
[2528.02 → 2529.06] And they
[2529.06 → 2529.36] Stoned
[2529.36 → 2529.60] Him
[2529.60 → 2531.20] So there
[2531.20 → 2531.54] Is no
[2531.54 → 2532.08] Guarantee
[2532.08 → 2532.62] That this
[2532.62 → 2532.90] Is a
[2532.90 → 2533.22] Safe
[2533.22 → 2533.52] Thing
[2533.52 → 2535.02] If
[2535.02 → 2535.66] Ananias
[2535.66 → 2535.94] Is going
[2535.94 → 2536.22] To do
[2536.22 → 2536.42] This
[2536.42 → 2536.66] He's
[2536.66 → 2536.80] Going
[2536.80 → 2536.94] To be
[2536.94 → 2537.26] Taking
[2537.26 → 2537.58] His
[2537.58 → 2537.84] Life
[2537.84 → 2538.10] In
[2538.10 → 2538.40] His
[2538.40 → 2538.90] Hands
[2538.90 → 2539.48] And
[2539.48 → 2539.60] He's
[2539.60 → 2539.68] Going
[2539.68 → 2539.80] To be
[2539.80 → 2540.10] Putting
[2540.10 → 2540.32] His
[2540.32 → 2540.54] Life
[2540.54 → 2540.70] On
[2540.70 → 2540.82] The
[2540.82 → 2541.12] Line
[2541.12 → 2541.76] It
[2541.76 → 2541.88] Was
[2541.88 → 2542.02] The
[2542.02 → 2542.20] Most
[2542.20 → 2542.58] Dangerous
[2542.58 → 2542.78] Thing
[2542.78 → 2542.90] You
[2542.90 → 2543.04] Can
[2543.04 → 2543.42] Imagine
[2543.42 → 2544.38] To go
[2544.38 → 2544.54] To
[2544.54 → 2544.92] This
[2544.92 → 2545.36] Man
[2545.36 → 2546.52] So he
[2546.52 → 2546.92] Says
[2546.92 → 2547.58] God
[2547.58 → 2547.84] Are
[2547.84 → 2548.04] You
[2548.04 → 2548.38] Sure
[2548.38 → 2549.36] And
[2549.36 → 2549.60] What's
[2549.60 → 2549.88] God's
[2549.88 → 2550.24] Response
[2550.24 → 2550.52] There
[2550.52 → 2550.72] In
[2550.72 → 2550.90] Verse
[2550.90 → 2551.34] 15
[2551.34 → 2551.54] He
[2551.54 → 2551.86] Simply
[2551.86 → 2552.28] Says
[2552.28 → 2553.38] Go
[2553.38 → 2554.80] This
[2554.80 → 2555.18] Man
[2555.18 → 2555.38] Is
[2555.38 → 2555.76] My
[2555.76 → 2556.22] Chosen
[2556.22 → 2556.78] Instrument
[2556.78 → 2557.12] For
[2557.12 → 2557.30] My
[2557.30 → 2557.68] Work
[2557.68 → 2558.62] So
[2558.62 → 2559.38] Ananias
[2559.38 → 2559.76] He
[2559.76 → 2560.06] Gets
[2560.06 → 2560.36] Up
[2560.36 → 2561.22] And
[2561.22 → 2561.38] He
[2561.38 → 2561.78] Goes
[2561.78 → 2563.30] And
[2563.30 → 2563.42] I
[2563.42 → 2563.62] Think
[2563.62 → 2563.76] What
[2563.76 → 2563.88] We
[2563.88 → 2564.08] See
[2564.08 → 2564.24] Here
[2564.24 → 2564.40] With
[2564.40 → 2565.04] Ananias
[2565.04 → 2565.70] Is
[2565.70 → 2565.98] That
[2565.98 → 2566.74] Welcome
[2566.74 → 2568.28] Involves
[2568.28 → 2568.76] Risk
[2568.76 → 2570.30] And
[2570.30 → 2570.82] Friends
[2570.82 → 2571.12] The
[2571.12 → 2571.40] World
[2571.40 → 2571.64] Has
[2571.64 → 2571.98] Never
[2571.98 → 2572.22] Been
[2572.22 → 2572.62] Changed
[2572.62 → 2572.78] For
[2572.78 → 2572.92] The
[2572.92 → 2573.20] Better
[2573.20 → 2574.10] Without
[2574.10 → 2575.36] People
[2575.36 → 2575.70] Who
[2575.70 → 2575.84] Are
[2575.84 → 2576.48] Willing
[2576.48 → 2576.92] To
[2576.92 → 2577.26] Take
[2577.26 → 2577.84] Risks
[2577.84 → 2579.78] And I
[2579.78 → 2579.92] Think
[2579.92 → 2580.12] This
[2580.12 → 2580.26] Is
[2580.26 → 2580.60] Helpful
[2580.60 → 2580.80] For
[2580.80 → 2580.96] Us
[2580.96 → 2581.10] To
[2581.10 → 2581.28] Keep
[2581.28 → 2581.42] In
[2581.42 → 2581.66] Mind
[2581.66 → 2581.88] As
[2581.88 → 2582.04] We
[2582.04 → 2582.38] Try
[2582.38 → 2582.62] To
[2582.62 → 2582.92] Live
[2582.92 → 2583.22] As
[2583.22 → 2583.38] A
[2583.38 → 2583.82] Church
[2583.82 → 2584.36] Who
[2584.36 → 2584.54] Is
[2584.54 → 2585.00] Called
[2585.00 → 2585.34] To
[2585.34 → 2585.80] Welcome
[2585.80 → 2586.74] And
[2586.74 → 2587.26] Help
[2587.26 → 2587.76] Those
[2587.76 → 2587.94] Who
[2587.94 → 2588.14] Are
[2588.14 → 2588.42] Different
[2588.42 → 2588.66] From
[2588.66 → 2588.96] Us
[2588.96 → 2589.78] And
[2589.78 → 2590.08] Maybe
[2590.08 → 2610.52] To
[2610.52 → 2611.54] Come
[2611.54 → 2615.68] To
[2615.68 → 2616.08] 離
[2616.08 → 2616.18] To
[2616.18 → 2618.90] is the grace that we see here.
[2619.92 → 2622.94] So friends, God's grace knows no limits.
[2623.06 → 2623.72] That's what we see.
[2624.24 → 2625.72] God's grace knows no limits.
[2626.02 → 2628.86] His grace will do things and go places
[2628.86 → 2631.06] that you and I never thought were possible.
[2632.44 → 2635.06] And this is what Saul experiences here.
[2635.64 → 2638.22] He experiences the grace of welcome.
[2639.10 → 2642.84] And so let's look at how gracious God is to Saul.
[2643.64 → 2645.86] First, the most interesting thing about this passage
[2645.86 → 2648.74] is that, notice who shows up.
[2650.50 → 2654.80] The resurrected Jesus Christ himself is present.
[2655.84 → 2658.96] Jesus, who, remember, had ascended into heaven,
[2659.62 → 2663.74] comes back down to speak to one guy in the book of Acts.
[2664.54 → 2665.58] I think, I'm pretty sure.
[2665.96 → 2667.26] To one guy, at least so far.
[2668.72 → 2670.52] But who did he come to speak to?
[2671.90 → 2674.22] Not one of those thousands of Christians
[2674.22 → 2678.20] that because of Pentecost and the coming of the Holy Spirit,
[2678.86 → 2680.88] and the Holy Spirit being out poured
[2680.88 → 2682.60] and gathering people into the church.
[2682.66 → 2683.52] Not one of those.
[2684.58 → 2687.04] Not one of the apostles who have been imprisoned
[2687.04 → 2690.74] and persecuted for proclaiming Jesus
[2690.74 → 2692.54] and performing miracles in his name.
[2692.54 → 2696.70] Not one of the seven who we saw in Acts chapter 6
[2696.70 → 2698.04] who were ordained as deacons.
[2698.84 → 2701.80] Instead, the resurrected Jesus humbles himself yet again
[2701.80 → 2707.18] and comes to welcome one who was persecuting him.
[2707.18 → 2714.04] Jesus does not give Saul what he deserves for his evil.
[2714.74 → 2715.78] But what does he do?
[2715.86 → 2720.54] He comes down, and he meets Saul right where he is
[2720.54 → 2726.52] on the road as he goes to seek to persecute his people.
[2728.32 → 2731.38] And Jesus comes to him where he is
[2731.38 → 2734.74] and he builds a community of welcome around him.
[2734.74 → 2738.18] So now let's all use our imaginations a little bit.
[2738.28 → 2739.86] Let's imagine that you are Saul.
[2740.98 → 2742.74] What is Saul experiencing?
[2743.64 → 2746.90] You are on the road to Damascus.
[2747.14 → 2749.56] It's a seven-day journey from Jerusalem.
[2749.76 → 2751.16] It's not a comfortable journey.
[2751.84 → 2753.42] And you're making this journey
[2753.42 → 2756.68] to pursue and capture Christians
[2756.68 → 2759.40] who you think are wrong
[2759.40 → 2761.66] and who are a threat
[2761.66 → 2763.14] and who are dangerous.
[2763.14 → 2767.96] And on the way you have a vision of Jesus.
[2768.68 → 2771.94] This one in whose name these people are
[2771.94 → 2776.20] proclaiming these wrong things about who God is.
[2776.56 → 2778.70] But this Jesus appears to you
[2778.70 → 2781.50] and this encounter completely blinds you.
[2782.28 → 2783.14] You're totally disoriented.
[2783.86 → 2784.84] You can't see a thing.
[2785.34 → 2786.90] You're lost in this darkness
[2786.90 → 2789.26] that just doesn't seem to go away.
[2789.26 → 2795.06] So Saul was in this incredibly vulnerable state.
[2796.04 → 2797.58] And what does God do?
[2798.22 → 2801.68] God gives him people to lead him by the hand
[2801.68 → 2803.44] and bring him to Damascus.
[2804.04 → 2805.98] He doesn't leave him alone.
[2806.18 → 2808.74] God is being incredibly gracious to Saul.
[2809.74 → 2812.64] And then God sends Ananias to visit Saul.
[2813.18 → 2814.30] So verse 17 says,
[2814.30 → 2817.54] Then Ananias went to the house and entered it.
[2818.56 → 2820.04] And then I love what happens next.
[2820.74 → 2824.06] And this is a picture of what the church ought to be.
[2824.68 → 2826.60] So what's the first thing that Ananias does?
[2827.26 → 2830.74] It says he lays his hands on Saul.
[2832.00 → 2833.32] And can you imagine now, Saul,
[2833.38 → 2834.66] what it must have felt like
[2834.66 → 2837.84] for someone to place their hands on you?
[2837.84 → 2841.22] To come to you in your darkness,
[2841.80 → 2843.10] your disorientation,
[2843.14 → 2844.96] your whole life has been turned upside down,
[2845.52 → 2846.60] in your lostness,
[2846.70 → 2847.26] and say,
[2847.82 → 2848.58] I am here.
[2849.54 → 2851.72] And he lays his hands upon him.
[2853.26 → 2855.40] And then do you notice the very first words
[2855.40 → 2857.04] that Ananias says to Saul?
[2858.18 → 2858.96] And these,
[2859.58 → 2861.36] one commentator pointed out,
[2861.52 → 2863.94] were probably the very first words
[2863.94 → 2865.42] Saul hears from a Christian.
[2865.42 → 2865.86] Right?
[2866.54 → 2868.36] The group that he has been murderously
[2868.36 → 2869.68] trying to pursue.
[2871.08 → 2871.56] Here,
[2872.10 → 2873.88] Saul receives a word from the church.
[2875.04 → 2876.78] What are those first words?
[2877.82 → 2878.62] He says,
[2879.42 → 2880.28] Brother Saul.
[2881.66 → 2881.96] Right?
[2882.02 → 2883.30] I think this is so beautiful.
[2883.80 → 2884.92] Brother Saul.
[2885.92 → 2886.38] He says,
[2886.48 → 2888.08] You're a member of the family.
[2888.96 → 2889.16] Right?
[2889.22 → 2890.70] And it's an embrace.
[2891.48 → 2892.30] It's not like,
[2892.30 → 2893.04] you know,
[2893.10 → 2894.12] Ananias coming up and saying,
[2894.12 → 2894.88] Hey, Saul,
[2894.88 → 2895.78] I was sent here.
[2896.10 → 2897.12] Meet my bodyguards.
[2897.88 → 2898.06] Right?
[2898.62 → 2899.68] It's not that.
[2899.80 → 2900.00] He's saying,
[2900.20 → 2900.54] Brother.
[2901.36 → 2903.36] It's this welcoming embrace.
[2904.44 → 2905.90] That's what grace does.
[2906.30 → 2908.88] It doesn't wait for Saul to amend his life.
[2909.44 → 2910.86] And Saul does amend his life,
[2911.00 → 2913.28] but grace doesn't wait for that.
[2913.44 → 2914.40] Grace comes first.
[2915.12 → 2916.56] And it goes to places,
[2916.68 → 2917.46] and it goes to people
[2917.46 → 2920.16] that nobody would have ever expected.
[2920.78 → 2921.54] That was possible.
[2921.54 → 2924.44] And you can imagine Saul thinking,
[2924.60 → 2924.68] You know,
[2924.76 → 2926.12] I am the last person
[2926.12 → 2927.60] who deserves any of this.
[2928.14 → 2929.92] And if I can receive this welcome,
[2931.32 → 2933.88] and I've tasted the welcome of God,
[2934.22 → 2936.18] that God is alive in these people,
[2936.82 → 2939.02] and this Jesus who I've been persecuting,
[2939.54 → 2941.74] this Jesus is the God who welcomes me.
[2941.74 → 2946.08] And so then verses 18 and 19,
[2946.24 → 2946.72] it says,
[2947.10 → 2948.86] Saul rose and was baptized.
[2950.02 → 2950.14] Right?
[2950.20 → 2951.86] And so being baptized in water,
[2952.08 → 2954.56] Saul declared his death to his old life
[2954.56 → 2957.20] and his rising to a new life.
[2958.02 → 2959.82] He has this complete conversion
[2959.82 → 2963.14] where he's now identifying himself with Christ
[2963.14 → 2966.54] who was crucified, risen.
[2966.54 → 2971.08] He receives the forgiveness of his sins,
[2971.26 → 2972.74] the water that symbolizes
[2972.74 → 2974.66] the washing away of all of his sins.
[2975.70 → 2977.36] And so Saul even described
[2977.36 → 2978.34] this amazing grace
[2978.34 → 2979.78] that he had received in 1 Timothy.
[2980.66 → 2984.00] You know, he later kind of refers to this
[2984.00 → 2985.42] many times in his writings.
[2986.82 → 2987.96] And so in 1 Timothy,
[2988.10 → 2989.84] he's reflecting on his conversion,
[2990.04 → 2990.92] his prior life,
[2991.32 → 2992.60] and he says,
[2992.60 → 2995.54] Here is a trustworthy saying
[2995.54 → 2997.00] that deserves full acceptance.
[2997.76 → 2999.84] Christ Jesus came into the world
[2999.84 → 3001.44] to save sinners
[3001.44 → 3003.66] of whom I am the worst.
[3004.76 → 3005.18] Right?
[3005.24 → 3005.74] He says,
[3006.26 → 3007.66] I won that contest.
[3008.28 → 3009.10] Worst sinner ever.
[3009.88 → 3010.06] Right?
[3010.70 → 3013.00] I was a persecutor of the church,
[3013.58 → 3015.60] but God's grace came to me.
[3016.82 → 3019.46] Grace means that there is forgiveness of sins.
[3019.94 → 3020.08] Right?
[3020.08 → 3023.68] Even sins as bad as Saul's.
[3024.62 → 3026.62] And that's a good reminder for all of us.
[3027.28 → 3029.48] Sometimes we think for ourselves
[3029.48 → 3031.86] or others that God's grace
[3031.86 → 3035.38] can never really reach the depths of my sin.
[3036.04 → 3037.70] But it reached Saul's,
[3037.74 → 3039.06] who himself said,
[3039.20 → 3040.20] I was the worst,
[3040.66 → 3042.44] but God's grace came to me.
[3044.22 → 3045.82] And so we see here that
[3045.82 → 3047.80] Saul's spiritual needs are met.
[3048.62 → 3048.84] Right?
[3048.84 → 3049.68] He's baptized.
[3050.00 → 3051.02] He's forgiven by God.
[3052.10 → 3053.00] And then what happens?
[3053.54 → 3055.10] The Christians give him food.
[3056.16 → 3056.30] Right?
[3056.40 → 3057.18] And so,
[3057.30 → 3058.60] his physical needs are met.
[3059.40 → 3060.78] And then they enfold him
[3060.78 → 3062.56] into the community of disciples
[3062.56 → 3063.42] in Damascus.
[3063.86 → 3064.82] And in that way,
[3064.90 → 3066.74] his social needs are met.
[3067.58 → 3067.72] Right?
[3067.96 → 3069.70] Saul has been fully embraced
[3069.70 → 3071.74] by this early group of Jesus' followers.
[3072.10 → 3073.50] And has changed his life.
[3073.50 → 3074.60] And he was cared for
[3074.60 → 3076.02] holistically,
[3076.88 → 3077.28] spiritually,
[3077.62 → 3078.06] physically,
[3078.34 → 3078.84] socially.
[3079.36 → 3081.34] And that's a picture of hospitality.
[3083.34 → 3084.10] So friends,
[3084.18 → 3085.20] what we see here
[3085.20 → 3086.24] is that hospitality
[3086.24 → 3087.22] is essential
[3087.22 → 3088.18] to the very meaning
[3088.18 → 3088.88] of the gospel.
[3089.22 → 3090.16] Because the gospel
[3090.16 → 3091.74] is that we receive
[3091.74 → 3092.32] the welcome
[3092.32 → 3093.40] and embrace of God
[3093.40 → 3095.42] when we were strangers
[3095.42 → 3097.18] and outsiders.
[3097.18 → 3099.28] And it's because
[3099.28 → 3100.60] of passages like this
[3100.60 → 3101.38] that the church
[3101.38 → 3102.34] from the beginning,
[3102.78 → 3104.14] from here in Acts,
[3105.06 → 3106.18] through to the time
[3106.18 → 3106.80] of the Reformation,
[3107.04 → 3107.98] until today,
[3108.22 → 3110.12] has become known
[3110.12 → 3111.90] for its practice
[3111.90 → 3112.66] of hospitality.
[3112.66 → 3114.86] So I want to give you
[3114.86 → 3116.42] another example of this
[3116.42 → 3117.32] that I really love.
[3117.82 → 3119.00] And it comes from
[3119.00 → 3120.22] the predecessors
[3120.22 → 3121.30] of the Reformation.
[3121.50 → 3121.98] It comes from
[3121.98 → 3122.94] the monastic movement
[3122.94 → 3124.78] of the 5th and 6th centuries.
[3125.86 → 3126.86] So monasteries
[3126.86 → 3127.88] were communities
[3127.88 → 3130.04] of men or women
[3130.04 → 3131.58] living together
[3131.58 → 3133.10] around a common
[3133.10 → 3134.10] rule of life.
[3135.12 → 3135.88] And monasteries
[3135.88 → 3137.12] were known to be places
[3137.12 → 3138.14] where strangers,
[3138.72 → 3140.26] no matter who they were,
[3140.82 → 3141.64] were welcomed
[3141.64 → 3142.64] as guests.
[3143.90 → 3145.22] And so the monasteries
[3145.22 → 3146.64] had these manuals
[3146.64 → 3148.06] that they would live by
[3148.06 → 3148.66] and that they would
[3148.66 → 3149.78] order their lives
[3149.78 → 3151.92] by in community.
[3152.10 → 3153.54] And one of the most famous
[3153.54 → 3155.50] manuals was,
[3155.70 → 3156.06] it's called
[3156.06 → 3157.22] The Rule of St. Benedict,
[3157.62 → 3158.22] written sometime
[3158.22 → 3159.06] in the 6th century.
[3160.16 → 3163.14] And so the guy,
[3163.24 → 3163.56] the rule,
[3164.38 → 3165.38] has all these little chapters
[3165.38 → 3166.48] regulating everything
[3166.48 → 3167.48] from when to wake up,
[3167.80 → 3168.44] what to eat,
[3168.54 → 3169.02] when to eat,
[3169.14 → 3169.78] what to wear,
[3170.04 → 3170.98] work that's to be done.
[3170.98 → 3172.92] Very kind of detailed,
[3173.20 → 3174.00] everyday stuff.
[3174.76 → 3176.76] But there are several chapters
[3176.76 → 3179.08] about their life
[3179.08 → 3180.18] of welcoming the stranger.
[3180.52 → 3180.92] And so,
[3181.14 → 3182.36] in one chapter,
[3182.60 → 3183.40] it describes
[3183.40 → 3184.98] the role
[3184.98 → 3185.88] of the porter
[3185.88 → 3187.64] of the monastery.
[3188.12 → 3188.94] So here's what it says
[3188.94 → 3189.74] about the porter.
[3190.74 → 3191.24] It says,
[3191.24 → 3192.76] a wise old monk
[3192.76 → 3194.64] should be stationed
[3194.64 → 3195.52] at the gate
[3195.52 → 3196.38] of the monastery.
[3197.08 → 3198.24] The porter will need
[3198.24 → 3198.98] to have quarters
[3198.98 → 3199.88] near the gate
[3199.88 → 3201.74] so that those who arrive
[3201.74 → 3203.68] will always find him present
[3203.68 → 3205.36] to answer their call.
[3206.46 → 3206.62] Right?
[3206.68 → 3207.80] His whole job
[3207.80 → 3209.20] was to be the person
[3209.20 → 3210.38] in the community
[3210.38 → 3212.16] who looked out
[3212.16 → 3212.92] for the stranger
[3212.92 → 3213.70] on the outside.
[3214.40 → 3216.38] And that was always ready
[3216.38 → 3217.62] to receive
[3217.62 → 3219.16] and welcome anyone,
[3219.16 → 3220.78] as the rule says,
[3220.92 → 3221.34] quickly
[3221.34 → 3222.76] and with the warmth
[3222.76 → 3223.34] of charity.
[3223.62 → 3224.40] Can you imagine that?
[3225.04 → 3226.24] Imagine our church
[3226.24 → 3227.14] where we have
[3227.14 → 3228.08] a person
[3228.08 → 3229.60] whose sole role
[3229.60 → 3230.08] it is
[3230.08 → 3230.66] to be standing
[3230.66 → 3231.38] at the door
[3231.38 → 3232.56] waiting
[3232.56 → 3233.42] to welcome
[3233.42 → 3234.50] anyone who would come in.
[3236.56 → 3237.02] And then after
[3237.02 → 3237.74] being received
[3237.74 → 3238.42] by the porter,
[3238.64 → 3239.42] the guest's arrival
[3239.42 → 3240.22] is then announced
[3240.22 → 3241.06] to the whole community.
[3241.60 → 3242.74] And the rule says,
[3242.94 → 3243.62] as soon as
[3243.62 → 3245.04] a guest is announced,
[3245.56 → 3246.36] the superior,
[3246.70 → 3247.24] or the abbot,
[3247.24 → 3248.74] the head of the community,
[3249.18 → 3250.22] and all the brothers,
[3250.62 → 3251.64] the entire community,
[3252.06 → 3252.88] should hurry
[3252.88 → 3254.26] to meet him,
[3254.46 → 3254.88] it says,
[3254.96 → 3255.98] with every mark
[3255.98 → 3256.56] of love.
[3258.42 → 3259.74] It was a community
[3259.74 → 3261.00] of radical welcome
[3261.00 → 3262.52] who met the needs
[3262.52 → 3263.28] of anybody
[3263.28 → 3264.20] who would come to them.
[3264.98 → 3266.00] Because they believed
[3266.00 → 3266.66] that the practice
[3266.66 → 3267.16] of welcome
[3267.16 → 3268.42] is at the heart
[3268.42 → 3269.02] of the gospel.
[3269.46 → 3270.36] And that in welcoming
[3270.36 → 3270.90] the stranger,
[3271.00 → 3271.78] they were welcoming
[3271.78 → 3272.88] Jesus Christ himself.
[3272.88 → 3274.76] And they believed
[3274.76 → 3275.94] that the Christian church
[3275.94 → 3277.22] is at its heart
[3277.22 → 3278.10] a community
[3278.10 → 3279.34] of welcome.
[3280.44 → 3281.12] So friends,
[3281.22 → 3282.22] I think that this
[3282.22 → 3284.12] is the most urgent task
[3284.12 → 3285.36] of the church
[3285.36 → 3286.08] in our day,
[3286.40 → 3287.40] is to recover
[3287.40 → 3289.38] this vocation
[3289.38 → 3290.90] of fearless welcome.
[3293.32 → 3294.44] So Saul,
[3294.76 → 3295.46] in this passage,
[3295.58 → 3296.40] received the welcome
[3296.40 → 3297.04] of God
[3297.04 → 3298.62] through the welcome
[3298.62 → 3299.22] of Christians.
[3299.86 → 3300.70] And it changed
[3300.70 → 3301.30] his life.
[3301.30 → 3302.86] And he became
[3302.86 → 3304.28] God's chosen instrument.
[3304.88 → 3305.74] As God said,
[3305.80 → 3306.24] he would,
[3306.34 → 3306.94] and as we see
[3306.94 → 3307.36] in the rest
[3307.36 → 3307.98] of the New Testament.
[3308.42 → 3309.60] And I want to leave you
[3309.60 → 3311.82] today with
[3311.82 → 3313.80] something that Paul wrote
[3313.80 → 3314.68] in his letter
[3314.68 → 3316.58] in the book of Galatians.
[3317.66 → 3318.44] So we'll put it here.
[3318.72 → 3319.96] This is what Paul wrote later.
[3320.68 → 3321.98] I have been crucified
[3321.98 → 3322.78] with Christ.
[3323.40 → 3324.20] It is no longer
[3324.20 → 3325.24] I who live,
[3325.32 → 3326.24] but Christ who lives
[3326.24 → 3326.80] in me.
[3327.44 → 3327.94] In the life,
[3328.02 → 3329.26] I now live in the flesh.
[3329.26 → 3330.24] I live by faith
[3330.24 → 3331.10] in the Son of God.
[3331.30 → 3332.44] who loved me
[3332.44 → 3334.06] and who gave himself
[3334.06 → 3335.14] for me.
[3335.98 → 3336.92] So friends,
[3337.76 → 3339.30] may we be motivated
[3339.30 → 3340.12] by this gospel.
[3340.94 → 3341.10] Right?
[3341.18 → 3343.22] May we never lose hope
[3343.22 → 3345.68] for those who we think
[3345.68 → 3346.94] are enemies of the gospel.
[3347.62 → 3348.14] Who we think
[3348.14 → 3349.24] will never come to faith.
[3350.34 → 3350.82] And also,
[3350.94 → 3351.48] let us remember
[3351.48 → 3352.44] that none of us
[3352.44 → 3353.58] deserves the grace of God.
[3353.92 → 3354.94] But it is God
[3354.94 → 3356.68] in his sovereign freedom
[3356.68 → 3357.56] who chooses
[3357.56 → 3359.02] to enter
[3359.02 → 3360.38] into our brokenness
[3360.38 → 3361.46] and to come to us
[3361.46 → 3362.60] in his grace.
[3362.68 → 3363.56] It's God's initiative.
[3364.44 → 3364.84] And then,
[3364.92 → 3365.76] when it comes to us,
[3365.82 → 3366.68] we receive it,
[3367.24 → 3369.20] we surrender to it,
[3369.36 → 3370.66] and it transforms us.
[3371.94 → 3372.22] Amen?
[3373.22 → 3373.64] Okay.
[3373.86 → 3374.30] Let's pray.
[3374.30 → 3374.40] Amen.
[3374.40 → 3378.02] Father,
[3378.12 → 3378.62] we thank you
[3378.62 → 3380.60] for your amazing grace,
[3381.48 → 3382.40] the amazing grace
[3382.40 → 3383.48] that we don't deserve,
[3383.86 → 3385.18] that we can never earn.
[3386.82 → 3387.46] Lord,
[3387.54 → 3388.30] we deserve
[3388.30 → 3391.30] your just condemnation,
[3391.42 → 3391.70] but Lord,
[3391.74 → 3393.10] we have received instead
[3393.10 → 3394.70] your forgiveness,
[3395.82 → 3397.32] a relationship with you,
[3397.92 → 3399.42] a community of faith,
[3399.42 → 3400.54] the fellowship
[3400.54 → 3401.42] of the Holy Spirit.
[3403.18 → 3403.70] Lord,
[3403.78 → 3404.96] we pray that
[3404.96 → 3406.14] you would make us,
[3406.26 → 3407.38] having received your welcome,
[3407.50 → 3408.98] into a community
[3408.98 → 3410.14] that welcomes others.
[3411.08 → 3411.26] Lord,
[3411.36 → 3412.48] would you help us
[3412.48 → 3413.62] even to take the risks
[3413.62 → 3414.40] that are involved.
[3415.96 → 3416.28] And Lord,
[3416.34 → 3417.70] may we share your grace
[3417.70 → 3418.62] with all those
[3418.62 → 3419.94] who you bring to us.
[3420.06 → 3421.08] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3421.74 → 3421.98] Amen.
[3429.42 → 3455.74] Take my life
[3455.74 → 3457.90] and let it be
[3457.90 → 3459.90] consecrated,
[3461.16 → 3461.54] Lord,
[3461.72 → 3463.04] to thee.
[3463.58 → 3466.00] Take my moments
[3466.00 → 3468.18] and my days,
[3468.40 → 3470.10] let them flow
[3470.10 → 3473.10] in endless praise,
[3473.10 → 3475.12] let them flow
[3475.12 → 3478.10] in endless praise.
[3479.82 → 3481.80] Take my hands
[3481.80 → 3484.10] and let them move
[3484.10 → 3487.16] and the impulse
[3487.16 → 3489.30] of thy love.
[3489.30 → 3491.30] Take my feet
[3491.30 → 3494.24] and let them be
[3494.24 → 3496.30] swift and beautiful
[3496.30 → 3498.30] for thee,
[3499.00 → 3501.30] swift and beautiful
[3501.30 → 3503.30] for thee.
[3505.78 → 3507.80] Take my voice
[3507.80 → 3510.30] and let me sing
[3510.30 → 3512.50] always call me
[3512.50 → 3514.50] for my King.
[3514.50 → 3517.40] Take my lips
[3517.40 → 3519.50] and let them be
[3519.50 → 3522.50] filled with messages
[3522.50 → 3524.50] from thee,
[3525.50 → 3527.50] filled with messages
[3527.50 → 3529.50] from thee.
[3529.50 → 3534.60] Take my silver
[3534.60 → 3536.70] and my gold,
[3536.70 → 3539.40] not a might
[3539.40 → 3541.70] but I withhold.
[3542.70 → 3545.20] Take my intellect
[3545.20 → 3546.70] and use
[3546.70 → 3548.70] every power
[3549.38 → 3552.04] as thou shalt choose,
[3552.50 → 3553.70] every power
[3554.32 → 3557.94] as thou shalt choose.
[3557.94 → 3561.14] take my will
[3561.14 → 3563.14] and make it thine,
[3563.14 → 3566.04] it shall be
[3566.04 → 3568.14] no longer mine.
[3569.34 → 3570.94] Take my heart,
[3571.30 → 3573.14] it is thine own,
[3573.14 → 3575.98] it shall be
[3575.98 → 3578.14] thy royal throne,
[3579.14 → 3581.04] it shall be
[3581.04 → 3583.74] thy royal throne.
[3583.74 → 3586.94] take my love,
[3586.94 → 3588.94] my Lord,
[3588.94 → 3589.94] I pour
[3589.94 → 3593.14] at thy feet
[3593.14 → 3595.94] its treasure store.
[3595.94 → 3597.94] Take myself
[3597.94 → 3600.94] and I will be
[3600.94 → 3602.94] ever only
[3602.94 → 3605.94] all for thee,
[3605.94 → 3607.94] ever only
[3607.94 → 3611.94] all for thee.
[3611.94 → 3612.44] Amen.
[3623.34 → 3624.34] Before we pray,
[3624.34 → 3626.04] there are some serious concerns
[3626.04 → 3626.84] to mention.
[3627.84 → 3628.94] Pastor Henry,
[3629.74 → 3631.14] struggling with poor health
[3631.14 → 3632.54] following chemo treatments
[3632.54 → 3635.14] for his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[3635.14 → 3637.74] Mel's sister,
[3637.74 → 3639.34] Kobe in Red Deer,
[3639.34 → 3640.14] had a stroke
[3640.14 → 3641.14] a month ago
[3641.14 → 3641.74] and now,
[3641.74 → 3642.74] very recently,
[3642.74 → 3644.54] had a serious heart attack.
[3644.54 → 3648.34] Get celebrated his 90th birthday
[3648.34 → 3649.54] on October 17th,
[3649.54 → 3651.34] but that same evening
[3651.34 → 3653.34] fell and broke his hip.
[3653.34 → 3655.34] He has had surgery
[3655.34 → 3657.34] and has returned to Elam Village
[3657.34 → 3659.34] where he now resides.
[3659.34 → 3662.54] And a note of celebration,
[3662.54 → 3664.54] Allie was able to celebrate
[3664.54 → 3666.24] her 95th birthday
[3666.24 → 3667.74] on October 16th
[3667.74 → 3670.14] and Andre is home again
[3670.14 → 3671.54] after many weeks
[3671.54 → 3673.54] at GF Strong Rehab Centre.
[3673.54 → 3675.74] He was able to return home
[3675.74 → 3677.54] on October 16th.
[3677.54 → 3679.74] Confident in the gracious
[3679.74 → 3682.24] and ever-widening mercy of God,
[3682.24 → 3685.44] let us pray for the world,
[3685.44 → 3687.24] the body of Christ
[3687.24 → 3689.04] and all who yearn
[3689.04 → 3691.44] for wholeness of life.
[3691.44 → 3692.44] Let us pray.
[3696.44 → 3697.44] God of freedom,
[3697.44 → 3699.04] grant that your church
[3699.04 → 3701.04] would continually be reshaped
[3701.04 → 3702.44] and reformed
[3702.44 → 3704.44] by the fire of the Holy Spirit.
[3704.44 → 3707.44] Show your righteousness,
[3707.44 → 3708.44] God of justice,
[3708.44 → 3710.44] that all who are oppressed
[3710.44 → 3711.44] and marginalized
[3711.44 → 3714.64] forgotten and cast aside
[3714.64 → 3716.24] would be given voice
[3716.24 → 3717.64] by elected leaders
[3717.64 → 3719.64] and compassionate citizens.
[3719.64 → 3723.24] Make wars to cease
[3723.24 → 3724.64] in all the world,
[3724.64 → 3725.64] God of peace,
[3725.64 → 3727.64] that all strife,
[3727.64 → 3729.64] violence and bloodshed
[3729.64 → 3732.24] give way to reconciliation,
[3732.24 → 3735.24] compassion and new life.
[3735.24 → 3738.64] Take us by our hand,
[3738.64 → 3740.24] God of companionship,
[3740.24 → 3742.04] when we are paralyzed
[3742.04 → 3743.44] by our fears
[3743.44 → 3745.24] and unable to step out
[3745.24 → 3746.44] in boldness.
[3746.44 → 3747.44] Give us courage
[3747.44 → 3749.44] to walk confidently with you.
[3749.44 → 3752.44] There is none like you,
[3752.44 → 3753.44] God of love,
[3753.44 → 3755.44] in your generosity,
[3755.44 → 3756.44] you're gifting,
[3756.44 → 3758.44] and your hospitality.
[3758.44 → 3760.44] And we thank you
[3760.44 → 3762.44] that you are in our lives,
[3762.44 → 3764.44] working in us and through us
[3764.44 → 3766.64] to let people know your kingdom
[3766.64 → 3768.64] is open to all.
[3768.64 → 3771.64] Give your stillness,
[3771.64 → 3772.64] God of calm,
[3772.64 → 3775.64] to all who are facing illness
[3775.64 → 3778.64] or any uncertainty of health.
[3778.64 → 3780.64] May they know that their times
[3780.64 → 3783.64] are in your ever-healing hands.
[3783.64 → 3785.84] God of calm,
[3785.84 → 3787.84] we pray especially today
[3787.84 → 3789.84] for those in our family struggling
[3789.84 → 3791.84] with cancer,
[3791.84 → 3793.84] namely Kim,
[3793.84 → 3795.84] Pastor Henry,
[3795.84 → 3797.44] Joan,
[3797.44 → 3798.84] Tim,
[3798.84 → 3799.84] and Kathy.
[3799.84 → 3801.84] We pray for complete healing
[3801.84 → 3804.84] for Pastor Mike from a serious infection,
[3804.84 → 3808.04] for Shirley following eye surgery,
[3808.04 → 3809.04] for Get,
[3809.04 → 3813.04] and for Don following yet another eye surgery.
[3813.04 → 3816.04] We pray for Andre,
[3816.04 → 3818.04] for adjustment to living at home
[3818.04 → 3821.04] and for complete healing.
[3821.04 → 3825.04] We pray for Mel's sister, Kobe.
[3825.04 → 3829.04] We thank you that Get could celebrate,
[3829.04 → 3831.04] even through a limited way,
[3831.04 → 3832.84] his 90th birthday
[3832.84 → 3836.04] and that Ellie could celebrate
[3836.04 → 3838.04] her 95th birthday recently.
[3838.04 → 3841.04] Gracious God,
[3841.04 → 3842.04] we pray that your loving presence
[3842.04 → 3844.04] would be felt by Cor,
[3844.04 → 3845.04] who is in poor health,
[3845.04 → 3847.04] and for all our shut-ins,
[3847.04 → 3851.04] Carl, Hank, Jeanette,
[3851.04 → 3852.04] and Honda.
[3852.04 → 3856.04] Lord, you are a mighty fortress,
[3856.04 → 3858.04] our strong deliverer.
[3858.04 → 3860.04] Listen to us when we call upon you,
[3860.04 → 3862.04] most merciful God,
[3862.04 → 3866.24] and grant us grace to entrust our lives
[3866.24 → 3868.24] and our world
[3868.24 → 3870.24] to your unfailing love,
[3870.24 → 3873.24] through Christ our Lord.
[3873.24 → 3874.24] Amen.
[3874.24 → 3888.24] That's master number two.
[3888.24 → 3891.44] So please rise,
[3891.44 → 3892.44] and we will go out
[3892.44 → 3894.44] with the Lord's blessing upon us
[3894.44 → 3895.44] and we'll sing our final song.
[3895.44 → 3897.44] And today's benediction
[3897.44 → 3901.44] comes from Paul's writing to Timothy.
[3901.44 → 3903.44] After he says he is the chief of sinners
[3903.44 → 3905.44] and that God's grace has come upon him,
[3905.44 → 3907.44] he gives this benediction.
[3907.44 → 3911.64] To the king of the ages,
[3911.64 → 3912.64] immortal, invisible,
[3912.64 → 3914.64] the only God,
[3914.64 → 3917.64] be honour and glory forever and ever.
[3917.64 → 3918.64] Amen.
[3918.64 → 3920.64] So let's remain standing
[3920.64 → 3924.84] and we'll sing our song of benediction.
[3924.84 → 3926.04] benediction.
[3926.04 → 3943.24] we will extol you, God and King,
[3943.24 → 3947.44] and bless your daily name.
[3947.44 → 3951.44] day after day
[3951.44 → 3953.44] we'll sing your praise
[3953.44 → 3957.44] forever and forever
[3957.44 → 3961.64] one generation
[3961.64 → 3964.64] will call to the next
[3964.64 → 3967.64] our God is good
[3967.64 → 3970.64] and his hand is strong
[3970.64 → 3972.64] all the world
[3972.64 → 3975.64] sings his marvellous hands
[3975.64 → 3978.84] and our voice
[3978.84 → 3979.84] and our voice
[3979.84 → 3981.84] will join with the last
[3981.84 → 3983.84] of the song
[3983.84 → 3990.84] great is the Lord
[3990.84 → 3993.84] in all his ways
[3993.84 → 3998.84] it's greatly to be praised
[3998.84 → 4004.04] I do search for endless days
[4004.04 → 4006.04] His greatness
[4006.04 → 4007.04] does not
[4007.04 → 4010.04] could fathom
[4010.04 → 4012.04] one generation
[4012.04 → 4015.04] will call to the last
[4015.04 → 4018.04] our God is good
[4018.04 → 4021.04] and his hand is strong
[4021.04 → 4023.84] all the world
