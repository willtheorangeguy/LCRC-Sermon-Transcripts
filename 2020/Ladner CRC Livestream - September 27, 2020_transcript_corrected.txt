[0.00 → 1.74] Don't go crazy with me
[1.74 → 5.76] Don't go crazy with me
[8.92 → 14.30] Don't go crazy with me
[17.58 → 21.00] ¿Mean a visitor here?
[21.98 → 25.98] He'll have a photo trim
[25.98 → 26.98] Amen.
[55.98 → 56.98] Amen.
[85.98 → 86.98] Amen.
[115.98 → 116.98] Amen.
[145.98 → 146.98] Amen.
[175.98 → 176.98] Amen.
[205.98 → 206.98] Amen.
[235.98 → 236.98] Amen.
[265.98 → 266.98] Amen.
[295.98 → 296.98] Amen.
[326.98 → 327.98] Amen.
[332.98 → 335.96] Amen.
[348.10 → 350.00] Good morning and
[350.00 → 352.02] welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[352.44 → 354.98] We are so grateful to see you guys all here today.
[354.98 → 357.30] and for those that are tuning in online.
[357.86 → 360.96] Just one quick announcement about the offering today.
[361.12 → 364.18] It'll be for Delta Christian School just down the street.
[365.00 → 369.14] You can mail a check, drop off a check at any time,
[369.14 → 371.90] or you can go to our website and deposit online.
[373.22 → 376.56] Every Sunday, it is God who calls us to gather with his people
[376.56 → 381.46] to not only praise and glorify him, but to also be refreshed and renewed.
[382.38 → 386.18] Listen to this invitation from Psalm 34, 1 to 10.
[386.92 → 389.50] I will extol the Lord at all times.
[389.70 → 391.74] His praise will always be on my lips.
[392.24 → 393.86] My soul will boast in the Lord.
[394.10 → 395.94] Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
[396.90 → 398.40] Glorify the Lord with me.
[398.72 → 400.38] Let us exalt his name together.
[401.06 → 403.22] I sought the Lord, and he answered me.
[403.58 → 405.64] He delivered me from all my fears.
[406.32 → 408.28] Those who look to him are radiant.
[408.98 → 410.98] Their faces are never covered with shame.
[410.98 → 413.68] This poor man called, and the Lord heard him.
[414.34 → 416.18] He saved him out of all his troubles.
[417.00 → 420.18] The angels of the Lord encamp around those who fear him,
[420.24 → 421.34] and he delivers them.
[422.02 → 424.22] Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[424.82 → 427.06] Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
[428.14 → 429.80] Fear the Lord, you his saints,
[430.22 → 432.06] for those who fear him lack nothing.
[432.72 → 435.66] The lion may grow weary, weak, and hungry,
[436.14 → 439.02] but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
[439.02 → 445.20] This next song is a new one that our choir actually did more at the beginning of the year,
[445.28 → 447.10] based on the passage that I just read.
[447.84 → 450.88] Now normally, this is where I'd ask you to please join me in singing,
[451.22 → 454.90] but for those in the congregation, unfortunately we can't do that right now.
[455.44 → 459.38] But remember, our lack of singing does not make our worship any less meaningful.
[460.02 → 461.36] God knows what's in our heart.
[461.36 → 464.52] So I suggest that you hum your hearts out today,
[464.72 → 468.60] and consider closing your eyes and reflecting on the words of each song,
[468.82 → 471.84] and perhaps consider them a prayer to our Heavenly Father.
[471.84 → 493.78] I saw the Lord,
[493.78 → 497.78] And He answered me,
[497.78 → 501.78] And delivered me,
[501.78 → 502.02] And delivered me,
[502.02 → 506.06] From every fear,
[506.06 → 509.72] Those who look on Him,
[510.64 → 511.78] Are radiant,
[513.78 → 516.78] Will never be ashamed,
[517.78 → 519.78] Will never be ashamed,
[519.78 → 524.78] This poor man cry,
[524.78 → 527.78] And the Lord had me,
[527.78 → 531.78] And saved me far,
[531.78 → 535.78] My enemies,
[535.78 → 539.78] The Son of God,
[539.78 → 543.78] Surrounds His face,
[543.78 → 547.78] He will deliver them,
[547.78 → 549.78] He will deliver them,
[549.78 → 551.78] He will deliver them,
[551.78 → 557.78] Magnify the Lord with me,
[557.78 → 563.78] Come and salt His name together,
[563.78 → 573.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[573.78 → 581.78] Come and salt His name forever,
[581.78 → 583.78] Oh,
[583.78 → 584.78] Oh,
[584.78 → 585.78] Taste and see,
[585.78 → 589.78] That the Lord is good,
[589.78 → 591.78] Oh,
[591.78 → 593.78] Blessed is He,
[593.78 → 595.78] Oh,
[595.78 → 596.78] I did,
[596.78 → 598.78] Oh,
[598.78 → 600.78] Fear the Lord,
[600.78 → 602.78] Oh,
[602.78 → 604.78] All you saints,
[604.78 → 605.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[605.78 → 607.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[607.78 → 609.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[609.78 → 613.78] Come and salt His name together,
[613.78 → 614.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[614.78 → 617.78] Glorify the Lord with me,
[617.78 → 619.78] with me
[619.78 → 623.78] Come and talk
[623.78 → 625.28] His name
[625.28 → 627.78] Together
[627.78 → 629.78] Glorify
[629.78 → 631.78] the Lord
[631.78 → 633.78] with me
[633.78 → 637.78] Come and talk
[637.78 → 639.78] His name
[639.78 → 641.78] forever
[647.78 → 653.78] Let us bless the Lord
[653.78 → 655.78] Every day
[655.78 → 657.78] and night
[657.78 → 659.78] Ever ending
[659.78 → 661.78] praise
[661.78 → 663.78] May our incense
[663.78 → 665.78] rise
[665.78 → 667.78] Let us bless the Lord
[667.78 → 669.78] Every day
[669.78 → 671.78] and night
[671.78 → 673.78] Ever ending
[673.78 → 675.78] praise
[675.78 → 677.78] May our incense
[677.78 → 679.78] rise
[679.78 → 681.78] glorify
[681.78 → 683.78] the Lord
[683.78 → 685.78] with me
[685.78 → 687.78] Come and talk
[687.78 → 689.78] His name
[689.78 → 691.78] Together
[691.78 → 693.78] glorify
[693.78 → 695.78] the Lord
[695.78 → 697.78] with me
[697.78 → 699.78] Come and talk
[699.78 → 701.78] His name
[701.78 → 703.78] forever
[703.78 → 705.78] forever
[705.78 → 709.78] Oh
[709.78 → 711.78] taste and see
[711.78 → 715.78] that the Lord is good
[715.78 → 717.78] He'll give you everything
[717.78 → 719.78] He'll give you everything
[719.78 → 721.78] He'll give you everything
[721.78 → 723.78] He'll give you everything
[723.78 → 729.78] do everything
[729.78 → 731.86] give you everything
[733.78 → 735.12] Each name
[735.12 → 763.76] Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[763.76 → 771.88] There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[772.88 → 780.26] Thou changes tall thy compassions, they fail not.
[780.98 → 787.76] As thou hast been, thou forever will be.
[787.76 → 797.22] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[797.76 → 803.76] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[803.76 → 812.56] All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[813.84 → 820.76] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[820.76 → 829.76] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[830.76 → 837.76] Sun, moon and stars in their courses above.
[837.76 → 846.76] Join with all nature in manifold witness.
[846.76 → 854.76] To thy faithfulness, mercy and love.
[854.76 → 863.00] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[863.00 → 869.76] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[869.76 → 878.76] All I have needed, thy hand hath rolled my head.
[878.76 → 886.76] Where is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me?
[886.76 → 896.76] Pardon for sin and the peace that endured.
[896.76 → 904.76] Thine own dear presence to cheer unto God.
[904.76 → 911.76] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[911.76 → 912.76] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[912.76 → 919.76] Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[919.76 → 920.76] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[920.76 → 924.76] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[924.76 → 929.76] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[929.76 → 936.76] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[936.76 → 944.76] All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[944.76 → 949.76] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[949.76 → 956.76] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[960.76 → 965.76] Saying sorry and asking for forgiveness does not come easily to most people.
[965.76 → 970.76] But it is an experience most feel vulnerable and weak.
[970.76 → 975.76] But when it comes to confessing before God, because Jesus died for us,
[975.76 → 978.76] it is a chance to find freedom and healing.
[978.76 → 981.76] We are not meant to carry the burdens that we have.
[981.76 → 984.76] Please bow your heads and join me in prayer.
[985.76 → 991.76] Merciful God, in your gracious presence, we confess our sin and the sin of this world.
[991.76 → 997.76] Although Christ is among us as our peace, we are a people divided against ourselves
[997.76 → 1000.76] as we cling to the values of a broken world.
[1000.76 → 1006.76] The profit and pleasures we pursue lay waste the land and pollute the seas.
[1006.76 → 1012.76] The fears and jealousies that we harbour set neighbour against neighbour, nation against nation.
[1012.76 → 1017.76] We abuse your good gifts of imagination and freedom, of intellect and reason,
[1017.76 → 1019.76] and turn them into bonds of oppression.
[1019.76 → 1022.76] Lord, have mercy on us.
[1022.76 → 1024.76] Heal and forgive us.
[1024.76 → 1030.76] Set us free to serve you in the world as agents of your reconciling love in Jesus Christ.
[1030.76 → 1031.76] Amen.
[1031.76 → 1036.76] Take comfort from these well-known words from John 3, 16 to 17.
[1036.76 → 1041.76] For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,
[1041.76 → 1046.76] so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but have eternal life.
[1046.76 → 1050.76] Indeed, God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
[1050.76 → 1055.76] but in order that the world might be saved through him.
[1055.76 → 1057.76] Let's sing.
[1057.76 → 1080.76] Let's sing.
[1080.76 → 1081.76] Let's sing.
[1081.76 → 1082.76] Let's sing.
[1082.76 → 1099.30] Let's sing.
[1107.30 → 1108.02] Let's sing.
[1108.02 → 1109.14] Let's sing.
[1109.14 → 1109.56] Let's sing.
[1109.56 → 1110.58] Let's sing.
[1110.58 → 1110.70] Let's sing.
[1110.70 → 1110.72] Let's pray.
[1110.72 → 1116.42] Oh how I need you Lord
[1116.42 → 1120.48] You are my only hope
[1120.48 → 1124.90] You're my only plan
[1124.90 → 1131.60] So I will wait for you
[1131.60 → 1135.84] To come and rescue me
[1135.84 → 1140.28] Come and give me life
[1140.28 → 1147.06] I lift my eyes up
[1147.06 → 1150.90] To the mountains
[1150.90 → 1156.06] Where does my help come from?
[1158.46 → 1162.18] My help comes from you
[1162.18 → 1165.42] Maker of heaven
[1165.42 → 1171.20] Creator of the earth
[1171.20 → 1177.04] Oh how I need you Lord
[1177.04 → 1181.04] You are my only hope
[1181.04 → 1186.20] You're my only plan
[1186.20 → 1192.66] So I will wait for you
[1192.66 → 1196.98] To come and rescue me
[1196.98 → 1201.98] Come and give me life
[1201.98 → 1221.90] Good morning
[1221.90 → 1224.54] It's nice to see a lot of you
[1224.54 → 1225.24] Here this morning
[1225.24 → 1227.72] So we've been looking
[1227.72 → 1229.52] Throughout the book of Acts
[1229.52 → 1231.68] At the explosive growth
[1231.68 → 1232.64] Of the early church
[1232.64 → 1236.08] And this growth as we have seen
[1236.08 → 1237.76] Is the work of the Holy Spirit
[1237.76 → 1239.68] Filling and empowering
[1240.68 → 1243.18] The church for movement
[1243.18 → 1245.56] And we've seen that the church
[1245.56 → 1246.34] Has grown
[1246.34 → 1248.42] And that it has advanced
[1248.42 → 1250.46] In spite of two factors
[1250.46 → 1251.62] On the one hand
[1251.62 → 1252.74] There has been pressure
[1252.74 → 1253.74] From the outside
[1253.74 → 1256.64] So we've seen how Peter
[1256.64 → 1258.20] And John were imprisoned
[1258.20 → 1259.24] And then they were warned
[1259.24 → 1261.70] Not to speak in the name of Jesus
[1261.70 → 1264.00] But they continued
[1264.00 → 1266.84] Any way to preach Jesus
[1266.84 → 1268.70] They continued to do many signs
[1268.70 → 1269.34] And wonders
[1269.34 → 1271.06] And then that got them
[1271.06 → 1272.10] Into even more trouble
[1272.10 → 1273.38] Because all the apostles
[1273.38 → 1273.96] Were arrested
[1273.96 → 1275.84] And they were imprisoned
[1275.84 → 1276.74] And they were beaten
[1276.74 → 1278.92] And so these were
[1278.92 → 1280.92] External attacks on the church
[1280.92 → 1282.48] But also we've seen
[1282.48 → 1283.88] That the church has grown
[1283.88 → 1286.30] In spite of internal pressures
[1286.30 → 1287.90] So for instance
[1287.90 → 1288.84] We saw the story
[1288.84 → 1290.28] Of Ananias and Sapphira
[1290.28 → 1292.88] Who had lied to the Holy Spirit
[1292.88 → 1293.84] And this was
[1293.84 → 1295.32] Had the potential
[1295.32 → 1296.96] To kind of erode the church
[1296.96 → 1298.02] From the inside
[1298.02 → 1299.36] And then last week
[1299.36 → 1300.22] We also saw
[1300.22 → 1302.18] How in the community
[1302.18 → 1302.96] Of the church
[1302.96 → 1303.80] There was a division
[1303.80 → 1304.62] That arose
[1304.62 → 1306.16] And that this also
[1306.16 → 1307.32] Had the potential
[1307.32 → 1308.96] To kind of derail the church
[1308.96 → 1309.52] From the mission
[1309.52 → 1312.14] That God had them on
[1312.14 → 1313.82] The mission of proclaiming Jesus
[1313.82 → 1314.92] And so yet
[1314.92 → 1316.24] In spite of these threats
[1316.24 → 1318.18] Both external and internal
[1318.18 → 1320.80] The church continued to flourish
[1320.80 → 1323.02] And God's healing kingdom
[1323.02 → 1324.48] Continued to spread
[1324.48 → 1325.92] You know
[1325.92 → 1327.04] And if you are a Christian
[1327.04 → 1327.68] This morning
[1327.68 → 1329.84] God's healing
[1329.84 → 1331.50] The healing of the gospel
[1331.50 → 1332.52] The healing kingdom
[1332.52 → 1334.94] Has come to your life
[1334.94 → 1336.40] Because all of us
[1336.40 → 1337.82] We were enemies of God
[1337.82 → 1339.56] But through Jesus Christ
[1339.56 → 1340.28] We are forgiven
[1340.28 → 1342.12] And we are clothed
[1342.12 → 1343.24] In his righteousness
[1343.24 → 1345.16] And so now
[1345.16 → 1346.36] As God's people
[1346.36 → 1347.80] God calls us
[1347.80 → 1348.70] To live out
[1348.70 → 1349.96] The realities of the gospel
[1349.96 → 1350.92] That has come to us
[1350.92 → 1352.38] Together as the church
[1352.38 → 1354.02] So that
[1354.02 → 1355.98] This healing gospel
[1355.98 → 1357.14] That has come to us
[1357.14 → 1357.54] Would then
[1357.54 → 1358.72] Come into us
[1358.72 → 1359.90] And flow out
[1359.90 → 1361.04] Through us
[1361.04 → 1362.16] Into the world
[1362.16 → 1363.12] In this place
[1363.12 → 1363.72] Where God has
[1363.72 → 1365.06] Brought us
[1365.06 → 1365.88] Now
[1365.88 → 1368.30] And so today
[1368.30 → 1369.28] We are going to see
[1369.28 → 1370.86] That to be the people
[1370.86 → 1373.12] Who live out the gospel
[1373.12 → 1374.24] In our own lives
[1374.24 → 1375.42] Means
[1375.42 → 1377.46] To be people who forgive
[1377.46 → 1379.58] It means to be people
[1379.58 → 1380.26] Who forgive
[1380.26 → 1382.74] And so we are going to see this
[1382.74 → 1384.04] In the story of Stephen
[1384.04 → 1385.50] Who was the first Christian
[1385.50 → 1386.80] Martyr of the church
[1386.80 → 1388.92] And so we are going to read
[1388.92 → 1390.62] The end of chapter 6
[1390.62 → 1391.08] We have already read
[1391.08 → 1391.60] The first half
[1391.60 → 1392.54] We will read the second half
[1392.54 → 1394.22] And then we are going to
[1394.22 → 1395.90] Skip most of chapter 7
[1395.90 → 1398.52] Which is Stephen's
[1398.52 → 1399.90] Very long sermon
[1399.90 → 1401.14] And it is kind of
[1401.14 → 1402.58] A retelling of
[1402.58 → 1403.18] Old Testament
[1403.18 → 1403.94] Redemptive history
[1403.94 → 1404.84] We are going to skip all that
[1404.84 → 1405.26] Thank you
[1405.26 → 1405.80] You are welcome
[1405.80 → 1407.20] But please
[1407.20 → 1408.30] Go ahead and read it
[1408.30 → 1408.88] At home
[1408.88 → 1409.84] And we are going to
[1409.84 → 1410.68] Pick up at the end
[1410.68 → 1411.26] Of his sermon
[1411.26 → 1411.80] And then we are going to
[1411.80 → 1412.38] See what happens
[1412.38 → 1414.20] Okay so we will read
[1414.20 → 1416.22] Acts chapter 6
[1416.22 → 1417.24] Starting in verse 8
[1417.24 → 1419.12] So please give your attention
[1419.12 → 1420.50] To the reading of God's word
[1420.50 → 1421.94] Now Stephen
[1421.94 → 1423.44] A man full of God's grace
[1423.44 → 1424.02] And power
[1424.02 → 1425.94] Performed great wonders
[1425.94 → 1427.52] And signs among the people
[1427.52 → 1429.90] Opposition arose however
[1429.90 → 1431.46] From members of the synagogue
[1431.46 → 1432.64] Of the freedmen
[1432.64 → 1434.02] As it was called
[1434.02 → 1435.12] So this was a synagogue
[1435.12 → 1436.98] Of the Greek-speaking Jews
[1436.98 → 1439.36] So Jews of Cyrene
[1439.36 → 1440.24] In Alexandria
[1440.24 → 1441.52] As well as the provinces
[1441.52 → 1443.14] Of Cilicia and Asia
[1443.14 → 1444.98] Who began to argue with Stephen
[1444.98 → 1448.06] But they could not stand up
[1448.06 → 1448.98] Against the wisdom
[1448.98 → 1450.02] The spirit gave him
[1450.02 → 1450.68] As he spoke
[1450.68 → 1452.02] Then they secretly
[1452.02 → 1453.24] Persuaded some men
[1453.24 → 1453.72] To say
[1453.72 → 1455.18] We have heard Stephen
[1455.18 → 1456.56] Speak blasphemous words
[1456.56 → 1457.22] Against Moses
[1457.22 → 1457.98] And against God
[1457.98 → 1459.74] So they stirred up
[1459.74 → 1460.24] The people
[1460.24 → 1461.44] And the elders
[1461.44 → 1462.18] And the teachers
[1462.18 → 1462.90] Of the law
[1462.90 → 1464.48] They seized Stephen
[1464.48 → 1465.22] And brought him
[1465.22 → 1466.80] Before the Sanhedrin
[1466.80 → 1468.90] They produced
[1468.90 → 1470.02] False witnesses
[1470.02 → 1471.14] Who testified
[1471.14 → 1472.56] This fellow
[1472.56 → 1473.74] Never stopped speaking
[1473.74 → 1475.32] Against this holy place
[1475.32 → 1476.06] That is the temple
[1476.06 → 1477.56] And against the law
[1477.56 → 1479.64] For we have heard him say
[1479.64 → 1481.24] That this Jesus of Nazareth
[1481.24 → 1483.02] Will destroy this place
[1483.02 → 1484.78] And change the customs
[1484.78 → 1486.54] Moses handed down to us
[1486.54 → 1489.00] All who were sitting
[1489.00 → 1489.92] In the Sanhedrin
[1489.92 → 1491.20] Looked intently at Stephen
[1491.20 → 1493.42] And they saw that his face
[1493.42 → 1494.88] Was like the face of an angel
[1494.88 → 1497.22] So now skipping ahead
[1497.22 → 1498.52] At the end of Stephen's speech
[1498.52 → 1499.68] He says this
[1499.68 → 1501.50] You stiff-necked people
[1501.50 → 1503.24] Your hearts and ears
[1503.24 → 1504.88] Are still uncircumcised
[1504.88 → 1506.30] You are just like
[1506.30 → 1507.08] Your ancestors
[1507.08 → 1508.14] You always resist
[1508.14 → 1508.86] The Holy Spirit
[1508.86 → 1510.54] Was there ever a prophet
[1510.54 → 1511.24] Your ancestors
[1511.24 → 1512.38] Did not persecute
[1512.38 → 1514.08] They even killed those
[1514.08 → 1514.70] Who predicted
[1514.70 → 1516.04] The coming of the righteous one
[1516.04 → 1517.34] And now you have
[1517.34 → 1518.96] Betrayed and murdered him
[1518.96 → 1522.14] You who have received
[1522.14 → 1523.38] The law that was given
[1523.38 → 1524.30] Through angels
[1524.30 → 1525.90] But have not obeyed it
[1525.90 → 1527.20] When the members
[1527.20 → 1527.92] Of the Sanhedrin
[1527.92 → 1528.56] Heard this
[1528.56 → 1529.80] They were furious
[1529.80 → 1531.88] And gnashed their teeth
[1531.88 → 1532.24] At him
[1532.24 → 1533.26] Which is a really
[1533.26 → 1533.92] Interesting phrase
[1533.92 → 1536.12] But Stephen
[1536.12 → 1537.60] Full of the Holy Spirit
[1537.60 → 1538.68] Looked up to heaven
[1538.68 → 1540.78] And saw the glory of God
[1540.78 → 1542.06] And Jesus standing
[1542.06 → 1543.50] At the right hand of God
[1543.50 → 1545.36] Look he said
[1545.36 → 1546.40] I see heaven open
[1546.40 → 1547.32] And the Son of Man
[1547.32 → 1548.40] Standing at the right hand
[1548.40 → 1548.86] Of God
[1548.86 → 1550.76] At this they covered
[1550.76 → 1551.28] Their ears
[1551.28 → 1552.30] And yelled at the top
[1552.30 → 1552.86] Of their voices
[1552.86 → 1554.62] They all rushed at him
[1554.62 → 1556.06] Dragged him out of the city
[1556.06 → 1557.72] And began to stone him
[1557.72 → 1559.74] Meanwhile the witnesses
[1559.74 → 1561.00] Laid their coats
[1561.00 → 1561.58] At the feet
[1561.58 → 1562.42] Of a young man
[1562.42 → 1563.10] Named Saul
[1563.10 → 1565.62] While they were stoning him
[1565.62 → 1566.34] Stephen prayed
[1566.34 → 1567.10] Lord Jesus
[1567.10 → 1568.32] Receive my spirit
[1568.32 → 1570.34] Then he fell on his knees
[1570.34 → 1571.24] And cried out
[1571.24 → 1572.96] Lord do not hold
[1572.96 → 1573.82] This sin against them
[1573.82 → 1575.86] When he had said this
[1575.86 → 1577.22] He fell asleep
[1577.22 → 1580.38] This is the word of the Lord
[1580.38 → 1582.18] Thanks be to God
[1582.18 → 1583.36] Let's pray together
[1583.36 → 1586.68] Heavenly Father
[1586.68 → 1587.34] This is
[1587.34 → 1589.46] An amazing passage
[1589.46 → 1590.40] We see Stephen
[1590.40 → 1591.28] Who is so full
[1591.28 → 1592.26] Of grace and power
[1592.26 → 1594.42] He is full of
[1594.42 → 1595.24] Your glory
[1595.24 → 1596.70] And your spirit
[1596.70 → 1599.10] And Lord
[1599.10 → 1600.34] Now we ask
[1600.34 → 1600.74] Today
[1600.74 → 1601.34] This morning
[1601.34 → 1602.72] That the same spirit
[1602.72 → 1603.54] That filled Stephen
[1603.54 → 1604.38] Would fill us
[1604.38 → 1606.46] That we also
[1606.46 → 1607.74] Would hear
[1607.74 → 1609.16] What you would say
[1609.16 → 1610.22] To us in your word
[1610.22 → 1611.70] Through your holy prophets
[1611.70 → 1612.40] Have come
[1612.40 → 1614.08] Long ago
[1614.08 → 1614.86] And these words
[1614.86 → 1615.44] That were written
[1615.44 → 1616.36] In holy scripture
[1616.36 → 1617.24] And Lord
[1617.24 → 1618.58] We open these words today
[1618.58 → 1620.28] And they are still alive
[1620.28 → 1620.86] And powerful
[1620.86 → 1622.34] So we pray
[1622.34 → 1623.10] For your presence
[1623.10 → 1624.46] And your help
[1624.46 → 1624.80] Lord
[1624.80 → 1625.86] In Jesus name
[1625.86 → 1626.52] Amen
[1626.52 → 1630.04] So have you ever read
[1630.04 → 1630.62] The book
[1630.62 → 1631.30] Moby Dick
[1631.30 → 1633.46] I confess
[1633.46 → 1634.20] I have not
[1634.20 → 1635.20] It's something
[1635.20 → 1635.78] I hope
[1635.78 → 1636.14] Yeah
[1636.14 → 1638.76] I hope to
[1638.76 → 1639.30] Maybe put that
[1639.30 → 1640.04] On my reading list
[1640.04 → 1640.68] Soon
[1640.68 → 1641.60] One of these days
[1641.60 → 1643.18] But nevertheless
[1643.18 → 1644.50] Most people know the story
[1644.50 → 1644.92] Right
[1644.92 → 1645.62] There's a movie made
[1645.62 → 1646.36] In the 50s
[1646.36 → 1647.62] And it's a popular story
[1647.62 → 1648.32] And kind of
[1648.32 → 1649.22] The cultural imagination
[1649.22 → 1650.30] So there's this guy
[1650.30 → 1651.36] Named Captain Ahab
[1651.36 → 1653.10] And he is a whaler
[1653.10 → 1655.18] And early in his life
[1655.18 → 1655.70] He encountered
[1655.70 → 1656.94] A great white whale
[1656.94 → 1657.76] Named
[1657.76 → 1658.92] Moby Dick
[1658.92 → 1661.18] And Moby Dick
[1661.18 → 1663.12] Sank his whaling boat
[1663.12 → 1665.96] And bit off his leg
[1665.96 → 1668.12] And ever since then
[1668.12 → 1668.88] Ahab
[1668.88 → 1670.70] Has been absolutely
[1670.70 → 1671.74] Obsessed
[1671.74 → 1673.34] With getting revenge
[1673.34 → 1674.54] On the whale
[1674.54 → 1676.10] So he tracked him
[1676.10 → 1677.26] Around the world
[1677.26 → 1678.00] And
[1678.00 → 1679.92] Sorry
[1679.92 → 1681.04] I don't know if I did that
[1681.04 → 1685.32] He was consumed
[1685.32 → 1686.68] By revenge
[1686.68 → 1688.98] And anger
[1688.98 → 1690.54] He wanted to make
[1690.54 → 1691.94] The whale pay
[1691.94 → 1693.04] He wanted to get back
[1693.04 → 1693.62] At this whale
[1693.62 → 1696.48] When he lost his leg
[1696.48 → 1697.42] He made
[1697.42 → 1699.14] A prosthetic limb
[1699.14 → 1700.96] And he had it made
[1700.96 → 1702.82] Out of the jawbone
[1702.82 → 1703.78] Of a whale
[1703.78 → 1705.84] So his desire
[1705.84 → 1706.94] To make this whale pay
[1706.94 → 1708.10] Had literally become
[1708.10 → 1709.36] Part of his skeleton
[1709.36 → 1710.58] It had sunken
[1710.58 → 1711.64] Into his bones
[1711.64 → 1713.04] He was driven
[1713.04 → 1714.06] And overcome
[1714.06 → 1715.86] By revenge
[1715.86 → 1717.24] And then finally
[1717.24 → 1718.14] At the end of the book
[1718.14 → 1719.42] He catches up to the whale
[1719.42 → 1721.42] He harpoons the whale
[1721.42 → 1723.26] But the rope of the harpoon
[1723.26 → 1724.50] Gets wrapped around him
[1724.50 → 1725.20] And the whale
[1725.20 → 1726.02] Dives
[1726.02 → 1727.88] Drags Captain Ahab
[1727.88 → 1728.84] Ahab
[1728.84 → 1729.92] Off the boat
[1729.92 → 1731.20] Plunges
[1731.20 → 1732.34] Into the depths
[1732.34 → 1733.36] Down to his death
[1733.36 → 1735.12] And here are
[1735.12 → 1735.84] Ahab's
[1735.84 → 1736.58] Famous
[1736.58 → 1738.02] Famous last words
[1738.02 → 1739.96] He says
[1739.96 → 1739.98] He says
[1739.98 → 1741.70] To the last
[1741.70 → 1742.80] I grapple
[1742.80 → 1743.58] With thee
[1743.58 → 1744.92] Thee being the whale
[1744.92 → 1746.22] To the last
[1746.22 → 1746.78] I grapple
[1746.78 → 1747.18] With thee
[1747.18 → 1748.98] From hell's heart
[1748.98 → 1749.98] I stab
[1749.98 → 1750.68] At thee
[1750.68 → 1753.00] For hate's sake
[1753.00 → 1753.88] I spit
[1753.88 → 1755.54] My last breath
[1755.54 → 1756.48] At thee
[1756.48 → 1758.98] That is really dark
[1758.98 → 1761.62] But that's who
[1761.62 → 1762.42] Ahab
[1762.42 → 1763.42] Had become
[1763.42 → 1764.52] He held this
[1764.52 → 1765.44] Grudge
[1765.44 → 1765.94] Even
[1765.94 → 1767.32] To the depths
[1767.32 → 1767.94] Of the bottom
[1767.94 → 1768.72] Of the ocean
[1768.72 → 1769.64] Spiritually
[1769.64 → 1771.68] He was in hell's heart
[1771.68 → 1774.12] And it's a
[1774.12 → 1775.22] Chilling picture
[1775.22 → 1777.80] Of what can happen
[1777.80 → 1779.64] When we don't forgive
[1779.64 → 1781.90] It's a picture
[1781.90 → 1783.04] Of the alternative
[1783.04 → 1784.60] To forgiveness
[1784.60 → 1787.52] And so this is what
[1787.52 → 1788.28] We're going to consider
[1788.28 → 1788.82] This morning
[1788.82 → 1790.20] This wonderful
[1790.20 → 1791.42] Calling to forgive
[1791.42 → 1792.84] And this difficult
[1792.84 → 1794.18] Calling
[1794.18 → 1795.12] Of forgiveness
[1795.12 → 1796.32] That we have
[1796.32 → 1797.04] From our Lord
[1797.04 → 1798.10] You know
[1798.10 → 1798.52] And friends
[1798.52 → 1799.20] This is applicable
[1799.20 → 1800.60] To every single one of us
[1800.60 → 1801.12] You know
[1801.12 → 1802.06] Because all of us
[1802.06 → 1803.12] Have people
[1803.12 → 1804.40] In our lives
[1804.40 → 1806.38] Whom we need to forgive
[1806.38 → 1807.54] And my hope
[1807.54 → 1808.30] Is that God's word
[1808.30 → 1808.92] Can help us
[1808.92 → 1809.56] To do that
[1809.56 → 1811.20] Even though it's hard
[1811.20 → 1812.58] So as we look
[1812.58 → 1813.16] At this passage
[1813.16 → 1814.16] I want us to consider
[1814.16 → 1814.80] Three things
[1814.80 → 1815.90] Together this morning
[1815.90 → 1816.22] First
[1816.22 → 1816.68] The meaning
[1816.68 → 1817.26] Of forgiveness
[1817.26 → 1818.34] What can we learn
[1818.34 → 1819.00] About what it means
[1819.00 → 1819.60] From this passage
[1819.60 → 1820.32] Secondly
[1820.32 → 1821.12] The motivation
[1821.12 → 1822.64] That we need to forgive
[1822.64 → 1824.02] And then third
[1824.02 → 1825.62] The mission
[1825.62 → 1826.30] Of forgiveness
[1826.30 → 1827.84] And so let's look
[1827.84 → 1828.12] At those
[1828.12 → 1828.86] First the meaning
[1828.86 → 1830.44] What is forgiveness
[1830.44 → 1832.42] Well forgiveness
[1832.42 → 1834.22] Means to release
[1834.22 → 1834.98] Right
[1834.98 → 1835.64] It means to just
[1835.64 → 1836.80] Release someone
[1836.80 → 1837.56] From a debt
[1837.56 → 1839.02] You know
[1839.02 → 1839.52] And I'm sure
[1839.52 → 1840.34] That almost everyone
[1840.34 → 1841.98] Here has experienced
[1841.98 → 1843.88] Being sinned against
[1843.88 → 1844.76] And I don't mean
[1844.76 → 1845.26] Like someone
[1845.26 → 1846.10] Just cut you off
[1846.10 → 1846.54] In traffic
[1846.54 → 1847.96] I mean
[1847.96 → 1849.06] Something
[1849.06 → 1850.56] Something deeply hurtful
[1850.56 → 1853.58] And when that happens
[1853.58 → 1855.32] You know
[1855.32 → 1857.36] Somebody owes you
[1857.36 → 1858.70] You feel
[1858.70 → 1859.98] Profound
[1859.98 → 1861.94] Profoundly deep
[1861.94 → 1863.48] That somebody
[1863.48 → 1864.38] Has taken something
[1864.38 → 1864.94] From you
[1864.94 → 1866.12] And that you need
[1866.12 → 1867.16] To get it back
[1867.16 → 1869.16] And to forgive
[1869.16 → 1870.68] Means to release
[1870.68 → 1871.72] Someone from that debt
[1871.72 → 1872.86] Is to say
[1872.86 → 1873.94] Yes
[1873.94 → 1874.26] This
[1874.26 → 1875.06] This was
[1875.06 → 1876.36] Sin
[1876.36 → 1877.26] This was hurtful
[1877.26 → 1878.28] This was wrong
[1878.28 → 1878.46] And
[1878.46 → 1880.28] But I'm not going
[1880.28 → 1881.72] To make them pay
[1881.72 → 1883.54] This debt
[1883.54 → 1884.34] That they owe me
[1884.34 → 1885.62] And that's what
[1885.62 → 1886.50] Stephen is doing
[1886.50 → 1887.18] In this passage
[1887.18 → 1888.36] He says in verse 60
[1888.36 → 1890.04] Lord do not
[1890.04 → 1891.34] Hold this sin
[1891.34 → 1892.06] Against them
[1892.06 → 1893.42] He forgives them
[1893.42 → 1894.14] He says
[1894.14 → 1895.46] I'm not going to
[1895.46 → 1896.46] Demand that they pay
[1896.46 → 1896.92] And Lord
[1896.92 → 1898.04] I ask that you
[1898.04 → 1898.88] Also not demand
[1898.88 → 1899.50] That they pay
[1899.50 → 1901.52] So now as we
[1901.52 → 1902.38] Consider the meaning
[1902.38 → 1902.96] Of forgiveness
[1902.96 → 1903.84] From this passage
[1903.84 → 1904.68] There are just
[1904.68 → 1905.58] A couple of things
[1905.58 → 1906.86] That I think we see
[1906.86 → 1907.62] Here that are
[1907.62 → 1908.22] Super helpful
[1908.22 → 1909.86] So first notice
[1909.86 → 1910.36] What Stephen
[1910.36 → 1911.14] Is not doing
[1911.14 → 1913.00] He's not saying
[1913.00 → 1914.90] It's not a big deal
[1914.90 → 1915.62] He's not kind of
[1915.62 → 1916.50] Brushing it off
[1916.50 → 1917.22] What is happening
[1917.22 → 1918.80] He says in verse 51
[1918.80 → 1921.18] You stiff-necked people
[1921.18 → 1922.54] Your hearts and ears
[1922.54 → 1924.06] Are still uncircumcised
[1924.06 → 1925.10] You are just like
[1925.10 → 1925.74] Our ancestors
[1925.74 → 1926.72] You always resist
[1926.72 → 1927.38] The Holy Spirit
[1927.38 → 1928.40] He's not trying
[1928.40 → 1929.12] To make friends
[1929.12 → 1930.68] He's saying
[1930.68 → 1931.56] This
[1931.56 → 1932.60] In response
[1932.60 → 1933.40] To what is happening
[1933.40 → 1933.98] To him
[1933.98 → 1934.70] Right
[1934.70 → 1935.38] Think about what
[1935.38 → 1935.88] Is happening
[1935.88 → 1936.36] To Stephen
[1936.36 → 1936.94] They have
[1936.94 → 1937.88] Made false
[1937.88 → 1938.60] Accusations
[1938.60 → 1939.16] Against him
[1939.16 → 1939.46] They have
[1939.46 → 1940.42] Slandered him
[1940.42 → 1941.40] They have
[1941.40 → 1942.16] Bribed
[1942.16 → 1943.22] False witnesses
[1943.22 → 1945.98] And he
[1945.98 → 1946.76] Lets them
[1946.76 → 1947.36] Know it
[1947.36 → 1949.38] In no uncertain
[1949.38 → 1949.98] Terms
[1949.98 → 1950.66] He names
[1950.66 → 1951.44] Their sin
[1951.44 → 1952.28] They're saying
[1952.28 → 1952.62] You have
[1952.62 → 1953.36] Persecuted me
[1953.36 → 1953.80] And you have
[1953.80 → 1954.62] Persecuted every
[1954.62 → 1955.20] Prophet God
[1955.20 → 1955.92] Has ever sent
[1955.92 → 1956.54] You resist
[1956.54 → 1957.20] The Holy Spirit
[1957.20 → 1957.84] Okay
[1957.84 → 1959.12] He calls out
[1959.12 → 1960.60] Their sin
[1960.60 → 1961.48] Against him
[1961.48 → 1962.86] And to forgive
[1962.86 → 1963.64] Someone means
[1963.64 → 1964.14] That we are
[1964.14 → 1965.12] Able to name
[1965.12 → 1966.32] Their sin
[1966.32 → 1966.82] We're able to
[1966.82 → 1967.50] Acknowledge it
[1967.50 → 1968.08] In our own
[1968.08 → 1968.56] Hearts
[1968.56 → 1970.12] And in many
[1970.12 → 1971.00] Cases you need
[1971.00 → 1971.72] To name
[1971.72 → 1972.34] The sin
[1972.34 → 1973.26] To the person
[1973.26 → 1974.14] Who sinned
[1974.14 → 1974.68] Against you
[1974.68 → 1976.34] And that's
[1976.34 → 1976.82] What we see
[1976.82 → 1977.42] Stephen doing
[1977.42 → 1978.24] And it's an
[1978.24 → 1979.10] Important step
[1979.10 → 1979.66] In forgiveness
[1979.66 → 1981.50] But it's not
[1981.50 → 1982.04] Enough just
[1982.04 → 1983.04] To name the sin
[1983.04 → 1984.74] Because forgiveness
[1984.74 → 1985.82] Also means
[1985.82 → 1987.28] Releasing people
[1987.28 → 1988.52] From the sin
[1988.52 → 1990.82] So what are
[1990.82 → 1991.46] Some ways
[1991.46 → 1992.12] That we
[1992.12 → 1994.00] Can hang on
[1994.00 → 1995.34] To a debt
[1995.34 → 1996.66] And not release it
[1996.66 → 1998.00] Well basically
[1998.00 → 1998.66] What we do
[1998.66 → 1999.44] Is we try to
[1999.44 → 2000.38] Make the offending
[2000.38 → 2001.78] Party pay
[2001.78 → 2002.72] Right
[2002.72 → 2003.54] You might
[2003.54 → 2004.48] And we do this
[2004.48 → 2005.06] In lots of ways
[2005.06 → 2005.76] Maybe we want
[2005.76 → 2006.36] To publicly
[2006.36 → 2007.44] Humiliate them
[2007.44 → 2008.32] You know
[2008.32 → 2008.98] Maybe we want
[2008.98 → 2009.72] To write
[2009.72 → 2012.46] A well worded
[2012.46 → 2013.10] Letter
[2013.10 → 2013.84] Or message
[2013.84 → 2014.72] To them
[2014.72 → 2016.46] You know
[2016.46 → 2017.02] Maybe you find
[2017.02 → 2017.92] Yourself gossiping
[2017.92 → 2018.38] About them
[2018.38 → 2018.82] When they're not
[2018.82 → 2019.14] Around
[2019.14 → 2020.96] Or you might
[2020.96 → 2021.70] Just try to
[2021.70 → 2022.82] Do to them
[2022.82 → 2024.00] In some way
[2024.00 → 2024.86] What they have
[2024.86 → 2025.50] Done to you
[2025.50 → 2027.40] There are all
[2027.40 → 2028.06] Kinds of ways
[2028.06 → 2028.70] That we can
[2028.70 → 2029.72] Try to make
[2029.72 → 2030.46] People pay
[2030.46 → 2032.00] But to forgive
[2032.00 → 2032.94] Means to not
[2032.94 → 2033.56] Make them pay
[2033.56 → 2034.84] Means that we
[2034.84 → 2036.22] Stop doing
[2036.22 → 2037.50] All these things
[2037.50 → 2038.60] That is trying
[2038.60 → 2039.54] To make people
[2039.54 → 2040.28] Pay for their
[2040.28 → 2040.58] Debt
[2040.58 → 2043.44] And a second
[2043.44 → 2044.30] Thing I want
[2044.30 → 2044.82] Us to notice
[2044.82 → 2046.22] Here is that
[2046.22 → 2047.38] Stephen forgives
[2047.38 → 2048.10] These people
[2048.10 → 2049.24] Even though
[2049.24 → 2050.70] They do not
[2050.70 → 2051.20] Repent
[2051.20 → 2052.24] Okay and this
[2052.24 → 2052.62] Is really
[2052.62 → 2053.02] Important
[2053.02 → 2055.44] So here's
[2055.44 → 2055.92] The question
[2055.92 → 2056.92] Do we
[2056.92 → 2058.30] Only have to
[2058.30 → 2059.22] Forgive people
[2059.22 → 2060.76] When they
[2060.76 → 2061.66] Repent
[2061.66 → 2062.38] To us
[2062.38 → 2063.36] Right
[2063.36 → 2063.96] Are we supposed
[2063.96 → 2064.84] To wait for the
[2064.84 → 2065.38] Person to come
[2065.38 → 2066.04] To us and say
[2066.04 → 2066.78] I'm sorry
[2066.78 → 2068.70] Before we
[2068.70 → 2069.30] Forgive them
[2069.30 → 2070.46] And what we
[2070.46 → 2071.18] See in this
[2071.18 → 2071.90] Passage is that
[2071.90 → 2072.40] The answer
[2072.40 → 2072.98] Is no
[2072.98 → 2074.44] Right and think
[2074.44 → 2074.78] About when
[2074.78 → 2075.60] Jesus teaches
[2075.60 → 2076.26] About forgiveness
[2076.26 → 2077.30] He doesn't
[2077.30 → 2078.00] Qualify it
[2078.00 → 2078.46] He doesn't
[2078.46 → 2079.74] Say teach
[2079.74 → 2080.30] His disciples
[2080.30 → 2080.80] To pray
[2080.80 → 2081.60] Lord forgive
[2081.60 → 2082.38] Us our debts
[2082.38 → 2083.72] As we forgive
[2083.72 → 2084.76] Our debtors
[2084.76 → 2086.26] Only when they
[2086.26 → 2086.84] Repent
[2086.84 → 2088.38] Of their sin
[2088.38 → 2089.02] Against us
[2089.02 → 2089.74] He doesn't
[2089.74 → 2090.52] Say that at all
[2090.52 → 2091.44] He says
[2091.44 → 2091.92] Lord forgive
[2091.92 → 2092.36] Us our debts
[2092.36 → 2093.20] As we forgive
[2093.20 → 2093.84] Our debtors
[2093.84 → 2095.52] And so forgiveness
[2095.52 → 2096.84] Doesn't hinge
[2096.84 → 2098.12] On repentance
[2098.12 → 2098.92] Of the other
[2098.92 → 2099.36] Person
[2099.36 → 2100.72] And in
[2100.72 → 2101.56] Stephen's case
[2101.56 → 2102.74] They wouldn't
[2102.74 → 2103.36] Have had an
[2103.36 → 2104.02] Opportunity
[2104.02 → 2105.30] To repent
[2105.30 → 2106.32] The rocks
[2106.32 → 2106.74] Are being
[2106.74 → 2107.90] Thrown at him
[2107.90 → 2109.32] They're striking
[2109.32 → 2110.16] His body
[2110.16 → 2110.96] Right
[2110.96 → 2111.46] They weren't
[2111.46 → 2111.96] Repenting
[2111.96 → 2112.54] They were in
[2112.54 → 2113.24] The midst
[2113.24 → 2114.18] Of sinning
[2114.18 → 2115.04] Against him
[2115.04 → 2115.94] And that is
[2115.94 → 2116.68] When
[2116.68 → 2117.84] Stephen
[2117.84 → 2119.20] Prays
[2119.20 → 2119.94] And says
[2119.94 → 2120.44] Lord don't
[2120.44 → 2120.98] Hold their sin
[2120.98 → 2121.54] Against them
[2121.54 → 2123.70] And so we
[2123.70 → 2124.22] Can forgive
[2124.22 → 2125.10] People even
[2125.10 → 2126.68] When they're
[2126.68 → 2127.14] Sinning
[2127.14 → 2128.16] Against us
[2128.16 → 2129.66] But it is
[2129.66 → 2130.26] Also very
[2130.26 → 2131.48] Important to
[2131.48 → 2132.54] Distinguish between
[2132.54 → 2133.48] Forgiveness and
[2133.48 → 2134.66] Reconciliation because
[2134.66 → 2135.60] They are not the
[2135.60 → 2136.12] Same thing
[2136.12 → 2138.78] So you can
[2138.78 → 2139.68] Forgive someone
[2139.68 → 2141.28] In your heart
[2141.28 → 2142.14] You can release
[2142.14 → 2142.74] Them from their
[2142.74 → 2144.02] Debt and yet
[2144.02 → 2145.08] Still not be
[2145.08 → 2146.18] Reconciled to
[2146.18 → 2146.44] Them
[2146.44 → 2148.26] So forgiveness
[2148.26 → 2149.94] Does not require
[2149.94 → 2151.12] Repentance from the
[2151.12 → 2151.92] Offending party
[2151.92 → 2153.56] But reconciliation
[2153.56 → 2154.30] Does
[2154.30 → 2155.54] Right
[2155.54 → 2156.98] So for instance
[2156.98 → 2158.30] You can't
[2158.30 → 2159.02] Forgive someone
[2159.02 → 2159.76] But at the
[2159.76 → 2160.48] Same time
[2160.48 → 2161.34] See to it
[2161.34 → 2163.42] That justice
[2163.42 → 2164.16] Is pursued
[2164.16 → 2166.36] And they face
[2166.36 → 2167.24] Legal consequences
[2167.24 → 2168.74] You can forgive
[2168.74 → 2169.54] Somebody and
[2169.54 → 2170.60] Still not trust
[2170.60 → 2172.04] Them because
[2172.04 → 2172.70] Of what they
[2172.70 → 2173.20] Did and they
[2173.20 → 2173.56] Have lost
[2173.56 → 2174.18] Your trust
[2174.18 → 2175.56] And there
[2175.56 → 2175.90] Might be
[2175.90 → 2176.58] Wisdom in
[2176.58 → 2177.00] Putting a
[2177.00 → 2177.80] Boundary between
[2177.80 → 2178.60] You and
[2178.60 → 2180.18] Them because
[2180.18 → 2180.88] They have not
[2180.88 → 2181.34] Repented
[2181.34 → 2182.74] And so it's
[2182.74 → 2183.30] Important to
[2183.30 → 2184.16] Distinguish between
[2184.16 → 2184.82] Forgiveness and
[2184.82 → 2185.46] Repentance and
[2185.46 → 2186.02] We are called
[2186.02 → 2186.56] To forgive
[2186.56 → 2188.50] And actually we
[2188.50 → 2189.24] Are called also
[2189.24 → 2190.24] To pursue
[2190.24 → 2191.72] Reconciliation as
[2191.72 → 2192.12] Our goal
[2192.12 → 2192.96] Paul says in
[2192.96 → 2194.02] Romans if it
[2194.02 → 2195.48] Is possible as
[2195.48 → 2196.28] Far as depends
[2196.28 → 2197.88] On you live at
[2197.88 → 2198.24] Peace with
[2198.24 → 2199.90] Everyone and
[2199.90 → 2200.98] So we are to
[2200.98 → 2202.40] Seek
[2202.40 → 2203.38] Reconciliation
[2203.38 → 2205.98] But that
[2205.98 → 2206.94] Does not hinge
[2206.94 → 2210.44] On repentance
[2210.44 → 2211.70] And Paul
[2211.70 → 2212.62] Recognizes he
[2212.62 → 2213.48] Says you know
[2213.48 → 2214.32] It's not always
[2214.32 → 2215.16] Possible to be
[2215.16 → 2215.64] At peace with
[2215.64 → 2216.54] Everyone and
[2216.54 → 2216.96] That's why he
[2216.96 → 2217.56] Says as far as
[2217.56 → 2218.06] It depends on
[2218.06 → 2220.86] You and so
[2220.86 → 2221.48] We don't see
[2221.48 → 2222.42] Stephen saying
[2222.42 → 2224.54] Like hey
[2224.54 → 2225.20] Everyone these
[2225.20 → 2225.76] People that are
[2225.76 → 2227.18] Stoning me you
[2227.18 → 2227.68] Know you should
[2227.68 → 2228.40] Trust these people
[2228.40 → 2229.04] As your spiritual
[2229.04 → 2230.66] Leaders right
[2230.66 → 2231.24] He's not saying
[2231.24 → 2232.00] That he's not
[2232.00 → 2233.10] Saying like I
[2233.10 → 2234.14] Highly recommend
[2234.14 → 2234.98] Their synagogues
[2234.98 → 2235.32] You should go
[2235.32 → 2235.82] Check out their
[2235.82 → 2236.88] Synagogues like
[2236.88 → 2237.32] That's not what
[2237.32 → 2237.82] He's doing at
[2237.82 → 2239.78] All he's not
[2239.78 → 2240.56] He's not
[2240.56 → 2241.42] Reconciled to
[2241.42 → 2241.80] Them he's not
[2241.80 → 2242.52] Trusting them
[2242.52 → 2244.56] But he is
[2244.56 → 2245.26] Forgiving them
[2245.26 → 2247.00] He is releasing
[2247.00 → 2247.66] Them from their
[2247.66 → 2249.78] Debt and even
[2249.78 → 2251.28] Though they
[2251.28 → 2252.38] Haven't repented
[2252.38 → 2254.30] But friends
[2254.30 → 2255.60] Refusing to
[2255.60 → 2257.98] Forgive means
[2257.98 → 2259.36] That we become
[2259.36 → 2260.08] Like little
[2260.08 → 2261.04] Captain Ahab's
[2261.04 → 2262.10] Right we
[2262.10 → 2263.12] Cling to the
[2263.12 → 2263.64] Sin that was
[2263.64 → 2264.62] Done against us
[2264.62 → 2265.52] And it begins
[2265.52 → 2266.64] To consume us
[2266.64 → 2267.90] And it is kind
[2267.90 → 2268.46] Of becomes a
[2268.46 → 2269.32] Part of us
[2269.32 → 2270.00] Kind of like
[2270.00 → 2271.12] Ahab's jawbone
[2271.12 → 2271.48] Leg
[2271.48 → 2273.42] But friends
[2273.42 → 2273.94] That's not the
[2273.94 → 2274.84] Way that God
[2274.84 → 2275.68] Desires for us
[2275.68 → 2276.10] To live
[2276.10 → 2277.68] Right he invites
[2277.68 → 2278.34] Us to a
[2278.34 → 2279.26] Better way of
[2279.26 → 2279.54] Living
[2279.54 → 2280.98] And so this
[2280.98 → 2281.72] Passion not only
[2281.72 → 2282.26] Shows us the
[2282.26 → 2282.68] Meaning of
[2282.68 → 2283.28] Forgiveness it
[2283.28 → 2284.14] Also gives us
[2284.14 → 2285.50] The motivation
[2285.50 → 2287.22] That we need
[2287.22 → 2288.08] To forgive
[2288.08 → 2289.18] And so let's
[2289.18 → 2289.62] Look at verse
[2289.62 → 2290.98] 55 it says
[2290.98 → 2292.04] But Stephen
[2292.04 → 2293.00] Full of the
[2293.00 → 2293.60] Holy Spirit
[2293.60 → 2294.26] Looked up to
[2294.26 → 2295.12] Heaven and
[2295.12 → 2295.82] Saw
[2295.82 → 2297.20] The glory
[2297.20 → 2297.82] Of God
[2297.82 → 2299.26] And Jesus
[2299.26 → 2300.90] Standing at
[2300.90 → 2301.46] The right
[2301.46 → 2301.98] Hand of
[2301.98 → 2302.28] God
[2302.28 → 2303.84] What's
[2303.84 → 2304.56] Fascinating
[2304.56 → 2305.34] Here and
[2305.34 → 2305.86] A lot of
[2305.86 → 2306.72] The commentators
[2306.72 → 2307.72] Mention this
[2307.72 → 2309.16] Is they
[2309.16 → 2310.06] Notice that
[2310.06 → 2311.22] Stephen is
[2311.22 → 2312.42] Standing at
[2312.42 → 2312.68] The right
[2312.68 → 2312.96] Hand of
[2312.96 → 2313.26] God
[2313.26 → 2314.28] Now it's a
[2314.28 → 2315.06] Small detail
[2315.06 → 2317.02] But why is
[2317.02 → 2317.94] Jesus standing
[2317.94 → 2319.10] Right because
[2319.10 → 2319.70] Most of the
[2319.70 → 2320.26] Descriptions that
[2320.26 → 2320.76] We have of
[2320.76 → 2322.12] Jesus describe
[2322.12 → 2322.92] Him as
[2322.92 → 2323.18] What
[2323.18 → 2325.72] Sitting at
[2325.72 → 2325.98] The right
[2325.98 → 2326.26] Hand of
[2326.26 → 2326.56] God
[2326.56 → 2327.36] So in
[2327.36 → 2327.70] Hebrews
[2327.70 → 2328.66] Chapter 10
[2328.66 → 2329.22] We're told
[2329.22 → 2330.04] But when
[2330.04 → 2330.98] This priest
[2330.98 → 2331.64] Jesus had
[2331.64 → 2332.16] Offered for
[2332.16 → 2332.98] All time
[2332.98 → 2333.86] One sacrifice
[2333.86 → 2334.38] For sin
[2334.38 → 2335.16] He did
[2335.16 → 2335.42] What?
[2336.06 → 2336.64] He sat
[2336.64 → 2337.36] Down at
[2337.36 → 2337.62] The right
[2337.62 → 2337.90] Hand of
[2337.90 → 2338.20] God
[2338.20 → 2339.28] In
[2339.28 → 2339.66] Hebrews
[2339.66 → 2340.18] Is making
[2340.18 → 2340.38] This
[2340.38 → 2341.00] Contrast
[2341.00 → 2342.08] Between
[2342.08 → 2342.74] The priest
[2342.74 → 2343.02] And the
[2343.02 → 2343.34] Temple
[2343.34 → 2344.44] Who always
[2344.44 → 2344.82] Stand
[2344.82 → 2345.34] Because they're
[2345.34 → 2345.94] Always doing
[2345.94 → 2346.46] Their work
[2346.46 → 2346.82] There's no
[2346.82 → 2347.50] Chairs in
[2347.50 → 2347.84] The temple
[2347.84 → 2348.44] They're always
[2348.44 → 2348.96] Standing
[2348.96 → 2349.66] To do
[2349.66 → 2350.18] Their work
[2350.18 → 2351.96] And Jesus
[2351.96 → 2353.24] The final
[2353.24 → 2354.06] Sacrifice for
[2354.06 → 2354.60] Sin
[2354.60 → 2355.52] Whose work
[2355.52 → 2356.08] Is now
[2356.08 → 2357.56] Finished
[2357.56 → 2358.46] So he
[2358.46 → 2358.98] Sits
[2358.98 → 2360.30] And that's
[2360.30 → 2360.90] Why we say
[2360.90 → 2361.10] In the
[2361.10 → 2361.50] Apostles
[2361.50 → 2361.88] Creed
[2361.88 → 2363.18] That Jesus
[2363.18 → 2364.38] Now sits
[2364.38 → 2364.66] At the
[2364.66 → 2365.04] Right hand
[2365.04 → 2365.38] Of God
[2365.38 → 2365.88] The Father
[2365.88 → 2366.38] Almighty
[2366.38 → 2368.50] And yet
[2368.50 → 2368.96] Here
[2368.96 → 2370.12] We see
[2370.12 → 2370.64] Jesus
[2370.64 → 2371.74] Standing
[2371.74 → 2373.58] And here's
[2373.58 → 2373.90] Why
[2373.90 → 2375.56] Romans 8
[2375.56 → 2376.26] Says this
[2376.26 → 2377.60] Who then
[2377.60 → 2378.06] Is the one
[2378.06 → 2378.92] Who condemns
[2378.92 → 2379.96] No one
[2379.96 → 2381.24] Christ Jesus
[2381.24 → 2381.96] Who died
[2381.96 → 2382.48] More than
[2382.48 → 2382.72] That
[2382.72 → 2383.04] Who was
[2383.04 → 2383.38] Raised
[2383.38 → 2383.86] To life
[2383.86 → 2384.74] Is at
[2384.74 → 2385.26] The right
[2385.26 → 2385.72] Hand of
[2385.72 → 2386.10] God
[2386.10 → 2386.46] And is
[2386.46 → 2387.00] Also
[2387.00 → 2388.32] Interceding
[2388.32 → 2388.94] For us
[2388.94 → 2390.20] See
[2390.20 → 2390.64] Jesus
[2390.64 → 2391.18] Sitting
[2391.18 → 2391.52] At the
[2391.52 → 2391.98] Right hand
[2391.98 → 2392.48] Of God
[2392.48 → 2392.92] Means
[2392.92 → 2393.78] That our
[2393.78 → 2394.28] Redemption
[2394.28 → 2395.90] Is accomplished
[2395.90 → 2396.30] Jesus
[2396.30 → 2397.20] Paid it
[2397.20 → 2397.54] All
[2397.54 → 2398.08] There's
[2398.08 → 2398.44] Nothing
[2398.44 → 2399.04] That we
[2399.04 → 2399.62] Now need
[2399.62 → 2399.96] To do
[2399.96 → 2400.26] In order
[2400.26 → 2400.78] To earn
[2400.78 → 2401.40] God's
[2401.40 → 2401.84] Forgiveness
[2401.84 → 2402.50] It's all
[2402.50 → 2403.64] Grace
[2403.64 → 2404.24] It's freely
[2404.24 → 2404.62] Given
[2404.62 → 2406.16] But the
[2406.16 → 2406.84] Bible also
[2406.84 → 2407.46] Tells us
[2407.46 → 2407.90] That Jesus
[2407.90 → 2408.90] Is interceding
[2408.90 → 2409.60] For us
[2409.60 → 2411.50] And so
[2411.50 → 2411.98] Think about
[2411.98 → 2412.64] A courtroom
[2412.64 → 2414.20] In a
[2414.20 → 2414.80] Courtroom
[2414.80 → 2415.92] Who is
[2415.92 → 2416.20] It
[2416.20 → 2417.46] That stands
[2417.46 → 2419.34] Usually
[2419.34 → 2419.82] The only
[2419.82 → 2420.22] Person
[2420.22 → 2420.92] Who stands
[2420.92 → 2421.26] In a
[2421.26 → 2421.80] Courtroom
[2421.80 → 2422.88] Is
[2422.88 → 2423.76] The advocate
[2423.76 → 2425.20] It's
[2425.20 → 2425.68] The one
[2425.68 → 2427.06] Who intercedes
[2427.06 → 2428.24] And pleads
[2428.24 → 2429.22] The case
[2429.22 → 2430.02] On behalf
[2430.02 → 2430.28] Of the
[2430.28 → 2430.92] Defendant
[2430.92 → 2431.72] And he
[2431.72 → 2432.52] Stands
[2432.52 → 2433.54] To make
[2433.54 → 2434.16] A case
[2434.16 → 2435.10] On the
[2435.10 → 2435.52] Behalf
[2435.52 → 2436.50] Of the
[2436.50 → 2437.14] Accused
[2437.14 → 2439.04] So now
[2439.04 → 2439.46] Look at
[2439.46 → 2439.82] Stephen
[2439.82 → 2441.24] Stephen
[2441.24 → 2442.98] Is
[2442.98 → 2444.72] An amazing
[2444.72 → 2445.18] Figure
[2445.18 → 2447.40] It tells us
[2447.40 → 2448.52] He dies
[2448.52 → 2450.16] So peacefully
[2450.16 → 2451.72] Right
[2451.72 → 2452.26] He dies
[2452.26 → 2452.66] With so
[2452.66 → 2452.96] Much
[2452.96 → 2454.00] Calmness
[2454.00 → 2455.30] And courage
[2455.30 → 2456.82] How can
[2456.82 → 2457.20] He does
[2457.20 → 2457.50] That
[2457.50 → 2459.00] And how
[2459.00 → 2459.32] Can he
[2459.32 → 2459.86] Go so
[2459.86 → 2460.34] Far
[2460.34 → 2461.06] As to
[2461.06 → 2461.64] Even
[2461.64 → 2462.88] Forgive
[2462.88 → 2465.02] Those who
[2465.02 → 2466.04] Are stoning
[2466.04 → 2466.40] Him
[2466.40 → 2468.10] And pray
[2468.10 → 2468.60] For them
[2468.60 → 2470.16] And it's
[2470.16 → 2470.74] Because at
[2470.74 → 2471.20] The same
[2471.20 → 2471.74] Moment
[2471.74 → 2473.18] That he
[2473.18 → 2473.60] Was being
[2473.60 → 2474.52] Condemned
[2474.52 → 2475.04] By an
[2475.04 → 2475.50] Earthly
[2475.50 → 2475.90] Court
[2475.90 → 2476.56] He
[2476.56 → 2477.26] Looks up
[2477.26 → 2477.48] Into
[2477.48 → 2477.82] Heaven
[2477.82 → 2478.84] And he
[2478.84 → 2479.20] Knew
[2479.20 → 2479.54] That he
[2479.54 → 2480.00] Was being
[2480.00 → 2480.74] Commended
[2480.74 → 2481.64] By a
[2481.64 → 2481.86] Heavenly
[2481.86 → 2482.22] Court
[2482.22 → 2483.42] He saw
[2483.42 → 2483.92] Jesus
[2483.92 → 2484.78] Standing at
[2484.78 → 2485.06] The right
[2485.06 → 2485.36] Hand of
[2485.36 → 2485.66] God
[2485.66 → 2486.74] Interceding
[2486.74 → 2487.66] On his
[2487.66 → 2488.18] Behalf
[2488.18 → 2488.92] And so
[2488.92 → 2489.32] For Stephen
[2489.32 → 2489.74] It doesn't
[2489.74 → 2490.36] Matter what
[2490.36 → 2490.84] Is happening
[2490.84 → 2491.66] In this
[2491.66 → 2491.96] Earthly
[2491.96 → 2492.28] Court
[2492.28 → 2493.42] Because he
[2493.42 → 2494.02] Knows he
[2494.02 → 2494.30] Has been
[2494.30 → 2495.20] Accepted
[2495.20 → 2497.28] And approved
[2497.28 → 2498.40] By this
[2498.40 → 2498.78] Divine
[2498.78 → 2499.12] Court
[2499.12 → 2500.56] And so
[2500.56 → 2500.80] Friends
[2500.80 → 2501.48] We have
[2501.48 → 2502.04] An advocate
[2502.04 → 2502.72] Jesus
[2502.72 → 2503.38] Christ
[2503.38 → 2504.36] Who makes
[2504.36 → 2504.88] A case
[2504.88 → 2505.46] For us
[2505.46 → 2506.62] Not based
[2506.62 → 2507.28] On our
[2507.28 → 2507.82] Own
[2507.82 → 2508.80] Merit
[2508.80 → 2509.40] Not based
[2509.40 → 2509.72] On anything
[2509.72 → 2510.30] We have
[2510.30 → 2510.70] Done
[2510.70 → 2511.16] Or our
[2511.16 → 2512.06] Accomplishments
[2512.06 → 2513.90] Because then
[2513.90 → 2514.42] We wouldn't
[2514.42 → 2515.12] Know if we
[2515.12 → 2515.52] Would be
[2515.52 → 2515.98] Acquitted
[2515.98 → 2517.64] We wouldn't
[2517.64 → 2518.02] The Bible
[2518.02 → 2518.42] Says
[2518.42 → 2520.08] But Jesus
[2520.08 → 2520.96] Advocates
[2520.96 → 2521.34] For us
[2521.34 → 2521.74] Based on
[2521.74 → 2522.24] His
[2522.24 → 2523.22] Perfect
[2523.22 → 2524.04] Righteousness
[2524.04 → 2525.56] And that
[2525.56 → 2526.28] Verdict
[2526.28 → 2527.86] In Jesus
[2527.86 → 2529.18] Was more
[2529.18 → 2529.80] Important to
[2529.80 → 2530.10] Stephen
[2530.10 → 2530.44] Than the
[2530.44 → 2530.72] Verdict
[2530.72 → 2531.22] Down here
[2531.22 → 2532.30] And so
[2532.30 → 2532.74] He could
[2532.74 → 2533.46] Face death
[2533.46 → 2533.96] Calmly
[2533.96 → 2534.52] He could
[2534.52 → 2534.90] Forgive
[2534.90 → 2535.28] His
[2535.28 → 2535.94] Enemies
[2535.94 → 2537.50] Because he
[2537.50 → 2538.06] Doesn't need
[2538.06 → 2538.38] To get
[2538.38 → 2538.66] Anything
[2538.66 → 2538.96] Back
[2538.96 → 2539.34] Everything
[2539.34 → 2539.80] Is given
[2539.80 → 2540.22] To him
[2540.22 → 2540.82] In Jesus
[2540.82 → 2541.68] He is
[2541.68 → 2542.16] Completely
[2542.16 → 2542.98] Accepted
[2542.98 → 2543.94] And approved
[2543.94 → 2544.76] By God
[2544.76 → 2546.58] And so
[2546.58 → 2547.90] That is what
[2547.90 → 2549.04] Enables him
[2549.04 → 2549.32] To be
[2549.32 → 2550.14] Gracious
[2550.14 → 2551.12] To the
[2551.12 → 2551.34] Very
[2551.34 → 2551.82] End
[2551.82 → 2553.70] And friends
[2553.70 → 2554.12] To the
[2554.12 → 2554.62] Extent
[2554.62 → 2555.10] That you
[2555.10 → 2555.76] And I
[2555.76 → 2557.42] Know that
[2557.42 → 2557.94] Jesus is
[2557.94 → 2558.42] Our advocate
[2558.42 → 2559.06] And that we
[2559.06 → 2559.82] Are able to
[2559.82 → 2560.54] Believe it
[2560.54 → 2561.70] And have
[2561.70 → 2562.22] That become
[2562.22 → 2562.90] Part of our
[2562.90 → 2563.42] Skeleton
[2563.42 → 2564.28] And become
[2564.28 → 2564.76] Part of
[2564.76 → 2565.48] Our soul
[2565.48 → 2566.38] What Jesus
[2566.38 → 2567.06] Has done
[2567.06 → 2567.68] To that
[2567.68 → 2568.34] Extent
[2568.34 → 2569.18] We will
[2569.18 → 2569.60] Be able
[2569.60 → 2570.30] To forgive
[2570.30 → 2572.06] And that's
[2572.06 → 2572.34] What the
[2572.34 → 2572.78] Grace of
[2572.78 → 2573.18] God does
[2573.18 → 2573.40] In our
[2573.40 → 2573.68] Lives
[2573.68 → 2574.66] It motivates
[2574.66 → 2575.58] Mercy
[2575.58 → 2576.56] In his
[2576.56 → 2577.22] Followers
[2577.22 → 2580.22] And so
[2580.22 → 2580.58] Lastly
[2580.58 → 2581.12] I want to
[2581.12 → 2581.90] Talk about
[2581.90 → 2583.64] Not just
[2583.64 → 2584.00] What the
[2584.00 → 2584.60] Meaning
[2584.60 → 2585.46] Of forgiveness
[2585.46 → 2585.78] And the
[2585.78 → 2586.54] Motivation
[2586.54 → 2587.02] But also
[2587.02 → 2587.54] The mission
[2587.54 → 2588.04] Of forgiveness
[2588.04 → 2589.86] Because
[2589.86 → 2591.02] If it's
[2591.02 → 2591.76] Our desire
[2591.76 → 2593.92] That our
[2593.92 → 2594.70] Friends
[2594.70 → 2596.14] Our family
[2596.14 → 2596.76] Our neighbours
[2596.76 → 2597.34] Who don't
[2597.34 → 2597.98] Know Jesus
[2597.98 → 2599.32] That they
[2599.32 → 2599.84] Would come
[2599.84 → 2600.30] To know
[2600.30 → 2600.70] Him
[2600.70 → 2602.16] Our desire
[2602.16 → 2602.66] Hopefully
[2602.66 → 2603.58] Is for
[2603.58 → 2604.26] These people
[2604.26 → 2605.20] To experience
[2605.20 → 2605.84] What?
[2606.94 → 2607.54] To experience
[2607.54 → 2608.38] God's forgiveness
[2608.38 → 2609.64] That they
[2609.64 → 2610.06] Would know
[2610.06 → 2610.64] That God
[2610.64 → 2611.44] Is gracious
[2611.44 → 2612.44] And that
[2612.44 → 2612.98] He is
[2612.98 → 2613.44] Forgiving
[2613.44 → 2615.00] And how
[2615.00 → 2615.40] Else
[2615.40 → 2615.92] Will the
[2615.92 → 2616.18] World
[2616.18 → 2616.86] Know this
[2616.86 → 2617.44] Unless the
[2617.44 → 2618.08] People of
[2618.08 → 2618.54] God
[2618.54 → 2619.72] Are known
[2619.72 → 2620.84] For forgiving
[2620.84 → 2621.40] Sins
[2621.40 → 2622.92] And if
[2622.92 → 2623.72] We as a
[2623.72 → 2624.04] People
[2624.04 → 2625.36] Kind of like
[2625.36 → 2626.30] Everyone else
[2626.30 → 2627.32] Go about
[2627.32 → 2627.88] Our lives
[2627.88 → 2628.62] Holding on
[2628.62 → 2629.28] To grudges
[2629.28 → 2630.16] And keeping
[2630.16 → 2630.68] Score
[2630.68 → 2631.34] Do you think
[2631.34 → 2632.08] Anybody is
[2632.08 → 2632.36] Going to
[2632.36 → 2633.12] Listen to us
[2633.12 → 2633.60] When we
[2633.60 → 2634.08] Talk about
[2634.08 → 2634.72] A God
[2634.72 → 2635.56] Who loves
[2635.56 → 2636.08] His enemies
[2636.08 → 2636.60] And who
[2636.60 → 2637.06] Forgives
[2637.06 → 2637.52] Sins
[2637.52 → 2640.22] It won't
[2640.22 → 2640.88] Be believable
[2640.88 → 2641.36] To them
[2641.36 → 2642.62] But when
[2642.62 → 2643.18] God
[2643.18 → 2643.90] What God
[2643.90 → 2644.12] Does
[2644.12 → 2644.76] He calls
[2644.76 → 2645.22] Us to
[2645.22 → 2645.82] Live as
[2645.82 → 2646.38] His people
[2646.38 → 2648.08] In the
[2648.08 → 2648.48] World
[2648.48 → 2650.00] By reflecting
[2650.00 → 2651.20] His character
[2651.20 → 2652.58] By forgiving
[2652.58 → 2653.04] Others
[2653.04 → 2654.26] Right
[2654.26 → 2654.60] And I want
[2654.60 → 2655.02] You to think
[2655.02 → 2655.56] About Jesus
[2655.56 → 2656.04] His last
[2656.04 → 2656.40] Words on
[2656.40 → 2656.82] The cross
[2656.82 → 2657.96] Right
[2657.96 → 2658.48] As
[2658.48 → 2659.24] Jesus
[2659.24 → 2659.72] Was
[2659.72 → 2660.36] His
[2660.36 → 2661.36] The nails
[2661.36 → 2661.76] We're being
[2661.76 → 2662.06] Driven
[2662.06 → 2662.58] Through his
[2662.58 → 2663.02] Hands
[2663.02 → 2663.74] And feet
[2663.74 → 2665.46] He said
[2665.46 → 2666.54] Father
[2666.54 → 2667.28] Forgive them
[2667.28 → 2667.92] For they
[2667.92 → 2669.26] Know not
[2669.26 → 2669.64] What they
[2669.64 → 2669.92] Do
[2669.92 → 2671.16] Right
[2671.16 → 2671.74] In Jesus
[2671.74 → 2672.58] Declaration
[2672.58 → 2673.18] On the
[2673.18 → 2673.56] Cross
[2673.56 → 2674.14] Was not
[2674.14 → 2674.62] Kind of
[2674.62 → 2675.14] Pleading
[2675.14 → 2675.60] With a
[2675.60 → 2675.96] God
[2675.96 → 2676.38] Who is
[2676.38 → 2677.22] Angry
[2677.22 → 2679.94] Because
[2679.94 → 2680.52] Jesus
[2680.52 → 2681.10] Says
[2681.10 → 2682.36] I only
[2682.36 → 2682.94] Say those
[2682.94 → 2683.34] Things which
[2683.34 → 2684.02] Please the
[2684.02 → 2684.38] Father
[2684.38 → 2685.28] And Jesus
[2685.28 → 2685.86] Also says
[2685.86 → 2686.52] I and the
[2686.52 → 2686.80] Father
[2686.80 → 2687.36] Are one
[2687.36 → 2688.10] So for him
[2688.10 → 2688.34] To say
[2688.34 → 2688.62] Father
[2688.62 → 2689.26] Forgive them
[2689.26 → 2689.46] If they
[2689.46 → 2689.74] Don't know
[2689.74 → 2690.04] What they
[2690.04 → 2690.56] Do
[2690.56 → 2691.56] He is
[2691.56 → 2692.10] In essence
[2692.10 → 2692.54] Uttering
[2692.54 → 2692.98] The very
[2692.98 → 2693.26] Heart
[2693.26 → 2693.76] Of God
[2693.76 → 2694.54] Jesus
[2694.54 → 2695.14] And the
[2695.14 → 2695.52] Father
[2695.52 → 2696.00] Share
[2696.00 → 2696.40] The same
[2696.40 → 2696.84] Heart
[2696.84 → 2698.70] And what
[2698.70 → 2699.10] We see
[2699.10 → 2699.40] Is that
[2699.40 → 2699.90] It is
[2699.90 → 2700.52] The Father's
[2700.52 → 2700.78] Heart
[2700.78 → 2701.48] To forgive
[2701.48 → 2702.54] And then
[2702.54 → 2703.00] So now
[2703.00 → 2703.52] Stephen
[2703.52 → 2703.88] In this
[2703.88 → 2704.36] Moment
[2704.36 → 2704.92] Of just
[2704.92 → 2705.50] Absolutely
[2705.50 → 2706.08] Yielding
[2706.08 → 2706.36] To the
[2706.36 → 2706.56] Holy
[2706.56 → 2706.94] Spirit
[2706.94 → 2708.20] As death
[2708.20 → 2708.66] Was at
[2708.66 → 2709.12] His feet
[2709.12 → 2709.40] He's
[2709.40 → 2710.34] Reflecting
[2710.34 → 2711.02] His
[2711.02 → 2711.38] Saviour
[2711.38 → 2711.82] Jesus
[2711.82 → 2712.98] When he
[2712.98 → 2713.34] Says
[2713.34 → 2713.92] Father
[2713.92 → 2714.52] Forgive
[2714.52 → 2714.80] Them
[2714.80 → 2717.02] So when
[2717.02 → 2717.54] We begin
[2717.54 → 2718.00] To forgive
[2718.00 → 2718.62] Others
[2718.62 → 2720.02] It is
[2720.02 → 2720.40] Mission
[2720.40 → 2721.54] Right
[2721.54 → 2721.92] People
[2721.92 → 2722.78] Around us
[2722.78 → 2723.22] Will begin
[2723.22 → 2723.64] To see
[2723.64 → 2724.24] That Christians
[2724.24 → 2724.78] Are actually
[2724.78 → 2725.28] Some of the
[2725.28 → 2726.00] Most forgiving
[2726.00 → 2726.58] People
[2726.58 → 2727.28] You would
[2727.28 → 2727.86] Ever meet
[2727.86 → 2729.62] You know
[2729.62 → 2730.58] And we
[2730.58 → 2731.04] Know that
[2731.04 → 2731.54] We live
[2731.54 → 2732.14] In a world
[2732.14 → 2732.54] That has
[2732.54 → 2734.28] So little
[2734.28 → 2735.00] Motivation
[2735.00 → 2735.64] To forgive
[2735.64 → 2737.24] It has
[2737.24 → 2737.72] So little
[2737.72 → 2738.54] Power to
[2738.54 → 2739.04] Forgive
[2739.04 → 2740.32] And a
[2740.32 → 2741.12] Radical
[2741.12 → 2741.82] Forgiveness
[2741.82 → 2743.56] Will show
[2743.56 → 2744.70] A watching
[2744.70 → 2745.16] World
[2745.16 → 2746.10] Who Jesus
[2746.10 → 2746.58] Is
[2746.58 → 2747.80] That he
[2747.80 → 2748.10] Is the
[2748.10 → 2748.56] God
[2748.56 → 2749.88] Who forgives
[2749.88 → 2750.38] Sins
[2750.38 → 2750.86] And that
[2750.86 → 2751.36] Means that
[2751.36 → 2752.42] All of us
[2752.42 → 2754.42] Can come
[2754.42 → 2754.80] To him
[2754.80 → 2755.54] Our friends
[2755.54 → 2756.08] Our neighbours
[2756.08 → 2756.52] Who don't
[2756.52 → 2756.86] Know him
[2756.86 → 2757.64] Can come
[2757.64 → 2758.16] To him
[2758.16 → 2759.06] And be
[2759.06 → 2759.52] Forgiven
[2759.52 → 2761.62] So let me
[2761.62 → 2761.98] Pray that
[2761.98 → 2762.36] God would
[2762.36 → 2762.84] Help us
[2762.84 → 2763.28] Let's pray
[2763.28 → 2763.64] Together
[2763.64 → 2767.74] Father this
[2767.74 → 2768.26] Is one of
[2768.26 → 2768.86] The hardest
[2768.86 → 2769.56] Callings
[2769.56 → 2772.06] That you
[2772.06 → 2772.52] Place on
[2772.52 → 2773.02] Our lives
[2773.02 → 2775.04] And we
[2775.04 → 2775.46] Can't do
[2775.46 → 2775.70] It is on
[2775.70 → 2776.10] Our own
[2776.10 → 2776.60] Lord
[2776.60 → 2778.76] But Lord
[2778.76 → 2779.40] We see
[2779.40 → 2781.08] How much
[2781.08 → 2781.62] We have
[2781.62 → 2782.60] Been forgiven
[2782.60 → 2784.18] Lord our
[2784.18 → 2784.92] Debt against
[2784.92 → 2785.50] You was
[2785.50 → 2785.98] Infinite
[2785.98 → 2788.68] But Lord
[2788.68 → 2789.02] You did
[2789.02 → 2789.52] Not hold
[2789.52 → 2790.02] It against
[2790.02 → 2790.48] Us
[2790.48 → 2791.84] But Lord
[2791.84 → 2792.16] You had
[2792.16 → 2792.82] Mercy on
[2792.82 → 2793.02] Us
[2793.02 → 2793.66] You forgave
[2793.66 → 2794.02] Us
[2794.02 → 2795.30] You paid
[2795.30 → 2795.84] The debt
[2795.84 → 2796.66] Jesus
[2796.66 → 2797.26] Died
[2797.26 → 2798.28] His blood
[2798.28 → 2798.76] Was shed
[2798.76 → 2799.82] In our
[2799.82 → 2800.28] Place
[2800.28 → 2802.26] And Lord
[2802.26 → 2802.74] As your
[2802.74 → 2803.36] People we
[2803.36 → 2804.48] Receive that
[2804.48 → 2804.98] Not based on
[2804.98 → 2805.50] Anything we
[2805.50 → 2805.96] Have done
[2805.96 → 2807.48] But Lord
[2807.48 → 2808.46] We don't
[2808.46 → 2809.12] Receive it
[2809.12 → 2811.06] Only for
[2811.06 → 2811.58] Ourselves
[2811.58 → 2812.08] But Lord
[2812.08 → 2813.22] You call
[2813.22 → 2814.56] Us to
[2814.56 → 2815.32] Forgive others
[2815.32 → 2816.04] To pass on
[2816.04 → 2816.52] This forgiveness
[2816.52 → 2817.02] That we have
[2817.02 → 2817.66] Received so
[2817.66 → 2818.08] That they
[2818.08 → 2818.64] Also might
[2818.64 → 2820.06] Know the
[2820.06 → 2820.96] God of
[2820.96 → 2821.36] Forgiveness
[2821.36 → 2822.52] So Lord
[2822.52 → 2822.84] Make us
[2822.84 → 2823.26] A people
[2823.26 → 2823.62] Make us
[2823.62 → 2824.20] A church
[2824.20 → 2826.26] Who is
[2826.26 → 2826.74] Able to
[2826.74 → 2827.14] Forgive
[2827.14 → 2828.04] Because of
[2828.04 → 2828.38] The Holy
[2828.38 → 2828.96] Spirit at
[2828.96 → 2829.34] Work within
[2829.34 → 2829.66] Us
[2829.66 → 2830.82] Lord in
[2830.82 → 2831.32] Your mercy
[2831.32 → 2832.28] Lord help
[2832.28 → 2832.66] Us we
[2832.66 → 2833.02] Pray in
[2833.02 → 2833.60] Jesus name
[2833.60 → 2834.36] Amen
[2834.36 → 2836.26] So why
[2836.26 → 2836.30] Don't
[2836.30 → 2836.86] We stand
[2836.86 → 2838.12] And because
[2838.12 → 2838.36] We've been
[2838.36 → 2838.74] Sitting for
[2838.74 → 2838.96] A bit
[2838.96 → 2839.22] Let's
[2839.22 → 2839.60] Stand if
[2839.60 → 2839.76] You're
[2839.76 → 2840.08] If you're
[2840.08 → 2840.52] If you'd
[2840.52 → 2840.78] Like
[2840.78 → 2841.48] And we
[2841.48 → 2841.86] Will
[2841.86 → 2842.80] Continue to
[2842.80 → 2843.24] Worship in
[2843.24 → 2843.54] Our song
[2843.54 → 2844.02] Of response
[2844.02 → 2858.64] To be
[2858.64 → 2860.82] Amen
[2860.82 → 2861.58] Bye
[2861.58 → 2879.40] You are my strength when I am weak
[2879.40 → 2883.26] You are my treasure that I seek
[2883.26 → 2887.54] You are my all in all
[2887.54 → 2894.44] Seeking you as a precious truth
[2894.44 → 2898.00] Not to give up but be a fool
[2898.00 → 2903.44] You are my all in all
[2903.44 → 2912.32] Jesus, Lamb of God
[2912.32 → 2919.22] Holy is your name
[2919.22 → 2927.06] Jesus, Lamb of God
[2927.06 → 2933.22] Holy is your name
[2933.22 → 2939.52] Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
[2939.52 → 2943.48] Rising again, I bless your name
[2943.48 → 2948.12] You are my all in all
[2948.12 → 2952.12] Jesus, Lamb of God
[2952.12 → 2958.54] When I am dry, you fill my cup
[2958.54 → 2965.44] You are my all in all
[2965.44 → 2973.44] Jesus, Lamb of God
[2973.44 → 2979.44] Holy is your name
[2979.44 → 2986.34] Jesus, Lamb of God
[2986.34 → 2994.34] Holy is your name
[2994.34 → 3002.34] Jesus, Lamb of God
[3002.34 → 3009.24] Holy is your name
[3009.24 → 3017.24] Jesus, Lamb of God
[3017.24 → 3023.24] Holy is your name
[3023.24 → 3032.98] You may be seated
[3032.98 → 3040.18] Friends, we now have the opportunity to go to the Lord in prayer
[3040.18 → 3044.40] And there are indeed many things to pray for
[3044.40 → 3050.06] And as we go to the Lord in prayer, we go with the confidence
[3050.06 → 3053.74] Knowing that our prayers are heard
[3053.74 → 3058.80] So let's join our hearts and our minds together in this time
[3058.80 → 3060.26] Would you please pray with me?
[3064.42 → 3069.44] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth
[3069.44 → 3074.14] Lord, hear the prayers of your people this morning
[3074.14 → 3079.62] As we come before you with our many needs
[3079.62 → 3085.12] Heavenly Father, we pray for the nations where wars still rage
[3085.12 → 3088.34] And where people, especially children
[3088.34 → 3091.74] Are displaced through no fault of their own
[3091.74 → 3094.88] Help us to trust in you
[3094.88 → 3097.00] Knowing that you abhor evil
[3097.00 → 3099.38] And you will judge in righteousness
[3099.38 → 3100.62] For you are good
[3100.62 → 3105.74] O God, we pray for refugees in camps around the world
[3105.74 → 3108.24] And we ask for their safety
[3108.24 → 3111.00] Many, Lord, have been waiting for years
[3111.00 → 3114.96] And we ask that new opportunities would open up for people to settle
[3114.96 → 3117.20] In safety and in new homes
[3117.20 → 3120.76] Lord, we earnestly pray for the Argus family
[3120.76 → 3122.70] Whose arrival was delayed
[3122.70 → 3125.94] Lord, grant them the necessary exit visas
[3125.94 → 3129.26] That they need to come here to be with us in Ladder
[3129.26 → 3132.16] Lord, you rule the hearts of kings
[3132.16 → 3135.68] We ask that you would make this happen
[3135.68 → 3139.56] Father, we pray for our own nation
[3139.56 → 3142.32] And as the pandemic continues in our cities
[3142.32 → 3144.02] And in our towns
[3144.02 → 3145.90] There is fear
[3145.90 → 3148.44] And there is distrust among people
[3148.44 → 3151.28] Many of us fear for the future
[3151.28 → 3155.00] And so we pray for your mercy to be upon us all
[3155.00 → 3157.98] And pray especially, Lord, that you would end the spread of this virus
[3157.98 → 3161.50] Especially now as we turn to the fall
[3161.50 → 3163.52] With kids returning to school
[3163.52 → 3166.30] Lord, keep us safe
[3166.30 → 3168.48] And would you help us, your people
[3168.48 → 3170.58] Look to you in every situation that comes
[3170.58 → 3172.94] Knowing that you are the sovereign Lord
[3172.94 → 3176.32] And nothing that happens is a surprise to you
[3176.32 → 3178.96] Nothing is out of your control
[3178.96 → 3183.38] And Father, we pray for our church
[3183.38 → 3188.06] Help us to rise up above our own comfort zones
[3188.06 → 3192.66] Help us to live as sons and daughters of the living God
[3192.66 → 3197.82] And gracious Lord, let your love abound in us by your spirit
[3197.82 → 3202.80] Help us not to be marred by the confusion that marks our times
[3202.80 → 3205.84] But give us the courage to speak what is right
[3205.84 → 3207.24] And what is true
[3207.24 → 3211.40] Father, bring revival to our hearts
[3211.40 → 3213.00] And our church
[3213.00 → 3216.20] Lord, bring revival to your churches
[3216.20 → 3218.68] In our land and all over the world
[3218.68 → 3221.62] And Lord, let this revival not stop with us
[3221.62 → 3223.98] But may it spill out into our community
[3223.98 → 3225.54] And beyond
[3225.54 → 3229.82] So Lord, we lift the city of Ladder and Delta to you
[3229.82 → 3233.66] Lord, we pray that all of those who do not yet know you
[3233.66 → 3237.18] Would, by your grace, come to know our Lord Jesus Christ
[3237.18 → 3240.34] And Father, as we come to you this morning
[3240.34 → 3244.02] We ask for your blessing and comfort upon all those who are sick
[3244.02 → 3246.06] And suffering among us
[3246.06 → 3249.96] Lord, we pray for Tim, Joan, and Kathy
[3249.96 → 3254.06] We pray for Andre, Shirley, and Connie
[3254.06 → 3258.02] And mighty God, we pray for others among us
[3258.02 → 3259.72] And in our families who are sick
[3259.72 → 3262.36] They are all known to you
[3262.36 → 3265.06] But we think of them now
[3265.06 → 3267.46] And lift them up before you
[3267.46 → 3270.80] Lord, bring healing to all those that we love
[3270.80 → 3275.10] And Lord, we ask again that you would make us
[3275.10 → 3277.36] People who experience your forgiveness
[3277.36 → 3279.80] And that with your help
[3279.80 → 3282.74] You would enable us to forgive others
[3282.74 → 3286.94] And in doing so, may you be glorified in our lives
[3286.94 → 3289.06] Hear our prayers
[3289.06 → 3292.66] As those who have been redeemed in Christ this morning
[3292.66 → 3294.70] In whose name we pray
[3294.70 → 3295.94] Amen
[3295.94 → 3299.72] So please stand now
[3299.72 → 3304.44] And we go out with our Father's blessing upon us
[3304.44 → 3307.12] And then we will sing our final song
[3307.12 → 3311.22] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3311.22 → 3312.64] And the love of God the Father
[3312.64 → 3314.42] And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[3314.42 → 3315.38] Be with you all
[3315.38 → 3316.78] Now and forever
