[360.00 --> 362.00]  Thank you.
[390.00 --> 392.00]  Thank you.
[392.00 --> 394.00]  Thank you.
[420.00 --> 422.00]  Thank you.
[422.00 --> 424.00]  Thank you.
[424.00 --> 426.00]  Thank you.
[426.00 --> 428.00]  Thank you.
[428.00 --> 430.00]  Thank you.
[430.00 --> 432.00]  Thank you.
[432.00 --> 434.00]  Thank you.
[434.00 --> 436.00]  Thank you.
[436.00 --> 438.00]  Thank you.
[438.00 --> 440.00]  Thank you.
[464.00 --> 466.00]  Thank you.
[466.00 --> 468.00]  Thank you.
[468.00 --> 470.00]  Thank you.
[470.00 --> 472.00]  Thank you.
[498.00 --> 500.00]  Thank you.
[500.00 --> 502.00]  Thank you.
[502.00 --> 504.00]  Thank you.
[504.00 --> 506.00]  Thank you.
[506.00 --> 508.00]  Thank you.
[508.00 --> 521.42]  How often in the stillness have I heard your voice
[521.42 --> 529.28]  Every whisper, every promise caused my heart to rejoice
[529.28 --> 538.36]  In the quiet of the morning, through the watches of the night
[538.36 --> 546.54]  And if I know my struggles, I spirit me that I fight
[546.54 --> 554.28]  For the power of Christ, for the power of God
[559.28 --> 568.34]  My soul longs for the day, I will see your face
[568.34 --> 576.10]  Hear your shout of jubilation, no more tears than your pain
[576.10 --> 584.24]  Every word at last is accomplished, heaven sings and only cries
[584.24 --> 592.24]  To our God, we the glory, let all creation rise
[592.24 --> 600.34]  Praise and honor to Christ, Lord of God, Lord of love
[600.34 --> 612.80]  Welcome to this service
[612.80 --> 617.22]  If you are longing for Christ
[617.22 --> 623.90]  If you are having a relationship with God that has some tension
[623.90 --> 629.68]  Or if there are some things going on that just leaves you cold
[629.68 --> 631.46]  You are still welcome here
[631.46 --> 635.06]  Come and be refreshed today
[635.06 --> 641.90]  Our invitation from God comes from Psalm 69, verse 32
[641.90 --> 646.74]  The humble will see their God at work and be glad
[646.74 --> 651.34]  Let all who seek God's help be encouraged
[651.34 --> 654.28]  There's a number of invitations here
[654.28 --> 657.64]  The humble, we are called to be humble
[657.64 --> 664.48]  We'll see, we are called to see our God at work
[664.48 --> 669.52]  Be glad, we are called to be glad because of the work that God does
[669.52 --> 670.52]  And we are called to be glad, we are called to be glad
[670.52 --> 671.52]  And we are called to be glad, we are called to be glad
[671.52 --> 674.84]  And we are called to seek God and be encouraged
[674.84 --> 678.52]  Please pray with me
[678.52 --> 682.30]  God, Father, Son, and Spirit
[682.30 --> 687.28]  Give us eyes to see you this morning and encourage us, we pray
[687.28 --> 691.82]  Receive your grace, mercy, and peace
[691.82 --> 694.26]  Through Christ our Lord, amen
[694.26 --> 699.14]  This is usually the time in our service where we greet one another
[699.14 --> 700.96]  And of course we can't do that today
[700.96 --> 705.38]  But as I look across the empty sanctuary
[705.38 --> 708.20]  I can almost see the faces because I know where people sit
[708.20 --> 710.24]  And I kind of miss greeting you
[710.24 --> 712.62]  And I'm sure many of you miss greeting one another
[712.62 --> 714.90]  So I'm going to put out a challenge this morning
[714.90 --> 720.72]  That this week, each of you phone somebody you haven't seen in a long time
[720.72 --> 723.22]  Maybe somebody that usually sits behind you
[723.22 --> 725.82]  And you don't normally socialize with them
[725.82 --> 728.28]  Or maybe somebody that sits beside you
[728.28 --> 730.50]  Just pick up the phone and give somebody a call
[730.50 --> 732.02]  And ask them how they're doing
[732.02 --> 735.38]  And especially remember those who are living on their own
[735.38 --> 738.10]  I hope you can do that this week
[738.10 --> 739.74]  I hope you want to hear that this time
[739.74 --> 744.12]  Thank you
[744.12 --> 762.02]  You can see
[762.02 --> 784.56]  We will exalt you, God, and me
[784.56 --> 790.50]  And bless your holy name
[790.50 --> 797.30]  Day after day we will sing the other praise
[797.30 --> 802.76]  Forever and forever
[802.76 --> 809.58]  One generation was led to the next
[809.58 --> 816.14]  Our God is one and his hand is strong
[816.14 --> 822.94]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts
[822.94 --> 832.94]  And our voice is turned with years in the song
[832.94 --> 862.94] 
[862.94 --> 869.74]  Our God is true and his hand is strong
[869.74 --> 875.90]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts
[875.90 --> 883.74]  And our voice will join with praise in the song
[883.74 --> 890.54]  Now may your name be sung
[890.54 --> 898.34]  In every tongue, in every place
[898.34 --> 904.96]  Seeing the faith of your great love
[904.96 --> 910.44]  In every generation
[910.44 --> 917.24]  One generation was led to the next
[917.24 --> 924.04]  Our God is good and his hand is strong
[924.04 --> 940.84]  And our voice will join with praise in the song
[940.84 --> 946.84]  From Psalm 78 verses 3 to 7
[946.84 --> 952.16]  We will not hide things we have heard and known
[952.16 --> 953.64]  Stories have told
[953.64 --> 957.38]  We will tell the next generation
[957.38 --> 960.46]  We will recount the praiseworthy deeds
[960.46 --> 962.02]  And the power of the Lord
[962.02 --> 964.38]  So that children yet unborn
[964.38 --> 965.58]  Will know them
[965.58 --> 967.72]  And tell them to their children
[967.72 --> 971.16]  So they will set their hope in God
[971.16 --> 973.42]  And obey God's commands
[973.42 --> 977.36]  As we sing this next song
[977.36 --> 979.46]  One that we've learned just a little while ago
[979.46 --> 980.82]  Jesus, Good and Kind
[980.82 --> 984.14]  I really hope that all you kids can really sing along
[984.14 --> 988.02]  We want to tell the story of Jesus
[988.02 --> 990.56]  And we want you to know the story of Jesus
[990.56 --> 1014.98]  Jesus said that if I thirst
[1014.98 --> 1019.46]  I should come to him
[1019.46 --> 1024.46]  No one else can satisfy
[1024.46 --> 1029.90]  I should come to him
[1029.90 --> 1035.58]  Jesus said if I am weak
[1035.58 --> 1040.18]  I should come to him
[1040.18 --> 1045.86]  No one else can be my strength
[1045.86 --> 1050.86]  I should come to him
[1050.86 --> 1055.86]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1055.86 --> 1061.16]  He will keep us day and night
[1061.16 --> 1066.86]  We can always run to Jesus
[1066.86 --> 1071.46]  Jesus, strong and bright
[1071.46 --> 1081.46]  Jesus said if I thirst
[1081.46 --> 1083.46]  Jesus said if I thirst
[1083.46 --> 1085.46]  Jesus said if I thirst
[1085.46 --> 1088.46]  I should come to him
[1088.46 --> 1090.46]  I should come to him
[1090.46 --> 1095.46]  No one else can be my shield
[1095.46 --> 1099.46]  I should come to him
[1099.46 --> 1101.46]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1101.46 --> 1106.46]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1106.46 --> 1111.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1111.46 --> 1116.46]  We can always run to Jesus
[1116.46 --> 1118.46]  Jesus, Jesus
[1118.46 --> 1122.46]  Jesus, strong and bright
[1122.46 --> 1124.46]  Jesus said if I thirst
[1124.46 --> 1137.46]  Jesus said if I thirst
[1137.46 --> 1141.46]  He will come to me
[1141.46 --> 1143.46]  And He will come to me
[1143.46 --> 1146.46]  And He should be on the cross
[1146.46 --> 1148.46]  He will come to me
[1148.46 --> 1152.46]  And He will come to me
[1152.46 --> 1157.46]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1157.46 --> 1158.46]  He will keep us day and faithful
[1158.46 --> 1159.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1159.46 --> 1160.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1160.46 --> 1164.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1164.46 --> 1166.46]  We can always run to Jesus
[1166.46 --> 1170.46]  Jesus, strong and bright
[1170.46 --> 1174.46]  Jesus, strong and bright
[1174.46 --> 1178.46]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1178.46 --> 1181.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1181.46 --> 1183.46]  He will keep us day and night
[1183.46 --> 1189.46]  We can always run to Jesus
[1189.46 --> 1194.46]  Jesus, strong and bright
[1208.46 --> 1231.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1231.46 --> 1237.46]  Fast and measured, boundless free
[1237.46 --> 1244.46]  Rolling as a mighty ocean
[1244.46 --> 1251.46]  In His fullness over me
[1251.46 --> 1257.46]  Underneath me, all around me
[1257.46 --> 1264.46]  Is the current of Thy love
[1264.46 --> 1265.46]  Leading onward
[1265.46 --> 1267.46]  Leading onward
[1267.46 --> 1268.46]  Leading onward
[1268.46 --> 1270.46]  Leading onward
[1270.46 --> 1275.46]  To my glorious breath
[1275.46 --> 1277.46]  Abound
[1277.46 --> 1285.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1285.46 --> 1291.46]  Spreading His grace from sure to sure
[1291.46 --> 1297.46]  How He loveth, ever loveth
[1297.46 --> 1305.46]  Changeth never, never more
[1305.46 --> 1312.46]  How He watches for His love once
[1312.46 --> 1319.46]  Died to God then on His own
[1319.46 --> 1326.46]  How He with them He interceded
[1326.46 --> 1333.46]  Watches over them from the throne
[1333.46 --> 1340.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1340.46 --> 1347.46]  Love of every love that best
[1347.46 --> 1350.46]  Tis an ocean
[1350.46 --> 1351.46]  Tis an ocean
[1351.46 --> 1353.46]  Thus the blessing
[1353.46 --> 1357.46]  Tis a living
[1357.46 --> 1360.46]  Sweet of rest
[1360.46 --> 1367.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1368.46 --> 1369.46]  Tis a living
[1369.46 --> 1370.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1370.46 --> 1384.46]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[1384.46 --> 1397.92]  Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[1397.92 --> 1402.58]  We begin to wrap our minds around it.
[1403.58 --> 1412.60]  As recipients of that kind of love, we want to please the one whose love will stop at nothing to give us everything.
[1412.60 --> 1419.94]  In the words of a song we sometimes sing, it's your kindness, oh Lord, that leads us to repentance.
[1421.34 --> 1424.00]  Our sin causes shame and guilt.
[1425.08 --> 1432.24]  When I was a little child, and maybe you kids can relate to this, when I was a little child, my conscience was very sensitive.
[1433.08 --> 1439.28]  If I had done something wrong, the sooner I went to my mom or dad and told them, the better I felt.
[1439.28 --> 1445.22]  Even if I was given some kind of punishment for what I did.
[1446.10 --> 1453.46]  Because until I came to them and told them what I had done, I had this guilty feeling within me that just ate away at me.
[1454.22 --> 1457.06]  And we're like that with Jesus.
[1458.20 --> 1462.82]  So we go to God time and time again to confess our sins.
[1462.82 --> 1468.24]  And again and again, he says to us, you are forgiven.
[1468.96 --> 1471.94]  I have freed you from the slavery to sin.
[1473.04 --> 1475.42]  Go and don't sin anymore.
[1476.78 --> 1480.26]  The pain he endured heals our wounds.
[1481.16 --> 1482.50]  Our guilt is removed.
[1483.08 --> 1487.10]  And we are free to live the life of joy he invites us into.
[1487.86 --> 1488.98]  Please pray with me.
[1488.98 --> 1500.74]  Jesus, your love, so deep, so wide, compels me to bow in humility and confess my sin.
[1501.78 --> 1511.06]  When I have not loved you, when I have ignored you, when I have turned a deaf ear to your voice, forgive me.
[1511.06 --> 1524.78]  When I have turned my face from the person who needs grace and love, passing by on the other side of the street, forgive me.
[1525.90 --> 1530.50]  When I have not loved my neighbor as myself, forgive me.
[1531.58 --> 1536.52]  Set me free from my addiction to my own wants over someone else's need.
[1536.52 --> 1540.56]  Thank you for your relentless mercy and love.
[1541.58 --> 1541.94]  Amen.
[1541.94 --> 1542.00]  Amen.
[1542.00 --> 1566.60]  All these pieces, broken and scattered.
[1566.60 --> 1573.54]  And mercy gathered, mended and whole
[1573.54 --> 1579.60]  Empty handed, but not forsaken
[1579.60 --> 1586.60]  I've been set free, I've been set free
[1586.60 --> 1593.98]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[1593.98 --> 1597.98]  That saved me rich like me
[1598.72 --> 1602.98]  Oh, I once was blessed
[1603.60 --> 1606.84]  But now I am felt
[1606.84 --> 1610.98]  Was blind, but now I see
[1610.98 --> 1615.20]  Oh, I can see you now
[1615.20 --> 1624.36]  Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[1624.36 --> 1629.20]  Laying yourself down
[1629.20 --> 1637.20]  Raising up the broken to a lie
[1637.20 --> 1652.86]  You take our failure
[1652.86 --> 1655.94]  You take our weakness
[1655.94 --> 1659.20]  You set our treasure
[1659.20 --> 1662.20]  In just a place
[1662.20 --> 1666.06]  So take this heart, Lord
[1666.06 --> 1668.20]  I'll be your vessel
[1668.20 --> 1672.20]  They want to see
[1672.20 --> 1675.20]  Your life in me
[1675.20 --> 1679.54]  Oh, amazing grace
[1679.54 --> 1682.76]  How sweet the sound
[1682.76 --> 1687.54]  That saved me rich like me
[1687.54 --> 1692.40]  Oh, I once was blessed
[1692.40 --> 1695.48]  But now I am felt
[1695.48 --> 1699.54]  Was blind, but now I see
[1699.54 --> 1702.54]  Oh, I can see you now
[1702.54 --> 1711.54]  Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[1711.54 --> 1716.54]  Laying yourself down
[1716.54 --> 1722.54]  Raising up the broken to a lie
[1722.54 --> 1724.54]  In his two lives
[1724.54 --> 1745.18]  Well, good morning, friends.
[1745.52 --> 1748.38]  It's great to be here on another Lord's Day
[1748.38 --> 1749.76]  And to worship the Lord with you.
[1749.76 --> 1751.82]  And we are in the season now
[1751.82 --> 1753.08]  I think it's the fifth week
[1753.08 --> 1754.34]  Of Ordinary Time
[1754.34 --> 1757.20]  And this season
[1757.20 --> 1758.62]  We as a church
[1758.62 --> 1760.66]  Are in a sermon series
[1760.66 --> 1762.08]  In the book of Acts
[1762.08 --> 1764.50]  And it's a series called
[1764.50 --> 1765.78]  The Church in Movement
[1765.78 --> 1767.98]  And we're considering together
[1767.98 --> 1769.40]  What it looks like for us
[1769.40 --> 1770.88]  To love God
[1770.88 --> 1773.98]  And to join God in his mission
[1773.98 --> 1775.96]  Together as a church family
[1775.96 --> 1778.40]  By the work of God's Holy Spirit
[1778.40 --> 1779.74]  In us and through us
[1779.74 --> 1781.98]  And this morning
[1781.98 --> 1783.46]  We're going to continue
[1783.46 --> 1784.98]  Our study in Acts
[1784.98 --> 1787.74]  With this passage in chapter 2
[1787.74 --> 1790.36]  That takes place at Pentecost
[1790.36 --> 1793.46]  And Pentecost is the day
[1793.46 --> 1795.80]  That comes 50 days after Easter
[1795.80 --> 1798.22]  And it's also a word
[1798.22 --> 1801.94]  That means God has shown up
[1801.94 --> 1804.18]  And this Pentecost
[1804.18 --> 1804.58]  And this Pentecost
[1804.58 --> 1806.88]  That we looked at last time
[1806.88 --> 1807.72]  If you remember
[1807.72 --> 1810.08]  Is not the first one
[1810.08 --> 1812.08]  Because in the Old Testament
[1812.08 --> 1814.66]  50 days after the Passover
[1814.66 --> 1817.70]  God showed up to Moses
[1817.70 --> 1819.00]  On Mount Sinai
[1819.00 --> 1821.16]  And met there
[1821.16 --> 1823.30]  To give his people his rules
[1823.30 --> 1825.38]  That they would live by
[1825.38 --> 1827.24]  And by living by them
[1827.24 --> 1828.66]  That they would be able
[1828.66 --> 1829.62]  To flourish
[1829.62 --> 1831.16]  As individuals
[1831.16 --> 1833.02]  And as a community
[1833.02 --> 1835.28]  And so here
[1835.28 --> 1837.10]  It's happening again
[1837.10 --> 1840.14]  Just as Jesus had promised
[1840.14 --> 1842.40]  God has shown up
[1842.40 --> 1843.36]  He has come
[1843.36 --> 1844.86]  To be with his people
[1844.86 --> 1846.34]  And meet with his people
[1846.34 --> 1848.24]  By the Holy Spirit
[1848.24 --> 1852.34]  The power came
[1852.34 --> 1855.00]  And it filled the whole room
[1855.00 --> 1855.98]  With this sound
[1855.98 --> 1857.58]  Of mighty rushing wind
[1857.58 --> 1859.94]  And tongues of flaming fire
[1859.94 --> 1862.38]  That fell upon each person there
[1862.38 --> 1865.00]  And they spoke in foreign languages
[1865.00 --> 1867.04]  Declaring the mighty deeds of God
[1867.04 --> 1869.48]  And friends
[1869.48 --> 1871.00]  The spirit hasn't left
[1871.00 --> 1873.06]  It came on that first day
[1873.06 --> 1873.90]  In Pentecost
[1873.90 --> 1875.40]  2,000 years ago
[1875.40 --> 1878.00]  And it is still here among us
[1878.00 --> 1878.90]  Christians believe
[1878.90 --> 1880.72]  That the Holy Spirit
[1880.72 --> 1882.92]  Is still here even now
[1882.92 --> 1885.22]  And so we're going to look
[1885.22 --> 1887.54]  At what the presence
[1887.54 --> 1889.70]  And the activity
[1889.70 --> 1891.36]  The movement of the Holy Spirit
[1891.36 --> 1893.46]  Makes possible for us
[1893.46 --> 1894.20]  Even today
[1894.20 --> 1896.72]  And today we're going to read
[1896.72 --> 1898.50]  A selection of verses
[1898.50 --> 1901.48]  From a longer sermon
[1901.48 --> 1904.16]  And it's the first recorded sermon
[1904.16 --> 1906.16]  Given in the history of the church
[1906.16 --> 1907.82]  It's the first sermon
[1907.82 --> 1909.58]  Preached by someone
[1909.58 --> 1911.62]  Other than Jesus himself
[1911.62 --> 1912.94]  And we'll see
[1912.94 --> 1915.16]  It's actually preached by Peter
[1915.16 --> 1918.90]  And so let's read the passage
[1918.90 --> 1919.72]  I'll read it for us
[1919.72 --> 1921.42]  We'll have the words on your screen
[1921.42 --> 1923.04]  And we're going to be looking
[1923.04 --> 1924.28]  In Acts chapter 2
[1924.28 --> 1928.70]  Starting in verse 12
[1928.70 --> 1931.56]  Amazed and perplexed
[1931.56 --> 1932.94]  They asked one another
[1932.94 --> 1934.62]  What does this mean?
[1935.92 --> 1936.66]  Some however
[1936.66 --> 1937.48]  Made fun of them
[1937.48 --> 1938.04]  And said
[1938.04 --> 1940.02]  They have had too much wine
[1940.02 --> 1942.78]  Then Peter stood up
[1942.78 --> 1943.40]  With the eleven
[1943.40 --> 1944.44]  Raised his voice
[1944.44 --> 1945.62]  And addressed the crowd
[1945.62 --> 1946.92]  Fellow Jews
[1946.92 --> 1947.70]  And all of you
[1947.70 --> 1948.80]  Who live in Jerusalem
[1948.80 --> 1951.20]  Let me explain this to you
[1951.20 --> 1952.08]  Listen carefully
[1952.08 --> 1952.90]  To what I say
[1952.90 --> 1955.70]  Jesus of Nazareth
[1955.70 --> 1956.88]  Was a man
[1956.88 --> 1958.16]  Accredited by God
[1958.16 --> 1958.72]  To you
[1958.72 --> 1959.86]  By miracles
[1959.86 --> 1960.28]  Wonders
[1960.28 --> 1960.98]  And signs
[1960.98 --> 1962.34]  Which God did
[1962.34 --> 1963.26]  Among you
[1963.26 --> 1963.98]  Through him
[1963.98 --> 1965.48]  As you yourselves know
[1965.48 --> 1967.64]  This man
[1967.64 --> 1969.16]  Was handed over to you
[1969.16 --> 1971.04]  By God's deliberate plan
[1971.04 --> 1972.04]  And foreknowledge
[1972.04 --> 1973.38]  And you
[1973.38 --> 1974.86]  With the help of wicked men
[1974.86 --> 1976.28]  Put to death
[1976.28 --> 1977.48]  Put him to death
[1977.48 --> 1978.74]  By nailing him
[1978.74 --> 1979.42]  To the cross
[1979.42 --> 1980.56]  But God
[1980.56 --> 1981.70]  Raised him from the dead
[1981.70 --> 1982.46]  Freeing him
[1982.46 --> 1983.78]  From the agony of death
[1983.78 --> 1985.46]  Because it was impossible
[1985.46 --> 1986.10]  For death
[1986.10 --> 1987.70]  To keep its hold on him
[1987.70 --> 1990.16]  God has raised
[1990.16 --> 1991.50]  This Jesus to life
[1991.50 --> 1992.94]  And we are all
[1992.94 --> 1994.00]  Witnesses of it
[1994.00 --> 1995.18]  Exalted
[1995.18 --> 1996.74]  To the right hand of God
[1996.74 --> 1997.62]  He has received
[1997.62 --> 1998.46]  From the Father
[1998.46 --> 1999.80]  The promised Holy Spirit
[1999.80 --> 2001.30]  And has poured out
[2001.30 --> 2002.40]  What you now see
[2002.40 --> 2003.02]  And hear
[2003.02 --> 2004.92]  For David
[2004.92 --> 2006.26]  Did not ascend to heaven
[2006.26 --> 2008.02]  And yet he said
[2008.02 --> 2009.16]  The Lord
[2009.16 --> 2010.24]  Said to my Lord
[2010.24 --> 2011.68]  Sit at my right hand
[2011.68 --> 2013.16]  Until I make
[2013.16 --> 2013.86]  Your enemies
[2013.86 --> 2014.66]  A footstool
[2014.66 --> 2015.56]  For your feet
[2015.56 --> 2017.50]  Therefore
[2017.50 --> 2018.64]  Let all Israel
[2018.64 --> 2019.76]  Be assured of this
[2019.76 --> 2021.36]  God has made
[2021.36 --> 2022.22]  This Jesus
[2022.22 --> 2023.72]  Whom you crucified
[2023.72 --> 2025.14]  Both Lord
[2025.14 --> 2026.54]  And Messiah
[2026.54 --> 2028.08]  When the people
[2028.08 --> 2028.60]  Heard this
[2028.60 --> 2029.24]  They were cut
[2029.24 --> 2029.88]  To the heart
[2029.88 --> 2030.80]  And said to Peter
[2030.80 --> 2031.80]  And the other apostles
[2031.80 --> 2033.24]  Brothers
[2033.24 --> 2034.70]  What shall we do?
[2035.88 --> 2036.88]  Peter replied
[2036.88 --> 2038.18]  Repent
[2038.18 --> 2039.30]  And be baptized
[2039.30 --> 2040.30]  Every one of you
[2040.30 --> 2041.38]  In the name
[2041.38 --> 2042.36]  Of Jesus Christ
[2042.36 --> 2043.06]  For the forgiveness
[2043.06 --> 2043.94]  Of your sins
[2043.94 --> 2045.36]  And you will receive
[2045.36 --> 2045.98]  The gift
[2045.98 --> 2046.88]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2046.88 --> 2048.58]  The promise
[2048.58 --> 2049.82]  Is for you
[2049.82 --> 2051.20]  And your children
[2051.20 --> 2052.54]  And for all
[2052.54 --> 2053.70]  Who are far off
[2053.70 --> 2055.06]  For all whom
[2055.06 --> 2055.58]  The Lord
[2055.58 --> 2056.16]  Our God
[2056.16 --> 2056.66]  Will call
[2056.66 --> 2058.82]  With many
[2058.82 --> 2059.78]  Other words
[2059.78 --> 2060.62]  He warned them
[2060.62 --> 2061.62]  And he pleaded
[2061.62 --> 2062.12]  With them
[2062.12 --> 2063.22]  Save yourselves
[2063.22 --> 2064.00]  From this corrupt
[2064.00 --> 2064.60]  Generation
[2064.60 --> 2066.44]  Those who accepted
[2066.44 --> 2067.06]  His message
[2067.06 --> 2067.62]  Were baptized
[2067.62 --> 2069.26]  And about
[2069.26 --> 2070.40]  Three thousand
[2070.40 --> 2071.56]  Were added
[2071.56 --> 2072.56]  To their number
[2072.56 --> 2073.60]  That day
[2073.60 --> 2075.56]  This is the word
[2075.56 --> 2076.10]  Of the Lord
[2076.10 --> 2078.48]  Thanks be to God
[2078.48 --> 2079.82]  Let's pray together
[2079.82 --> 2084.58]  Father it is
[2084.58 --> 2086.16]  So encouraging
[2086.16 --> 2087.62]  As we read your word
[2087.62 --> 2089.52]  To see your church
[2089.52 --> 2090.42]  As it is
[2090.42 --> 2092.24]  Just newly born
[2092.24 --> 2093.88]  Born by your spirit
[2093.88 --> 2096.36]  Filled with your spirit
[2096.36 --> 2097.90]  And proclaiming
[2097.90 --> 2099.48]  Who Jesus is
[2099.48 --> 2100.04]  To the world
[2100.04 --> 2101.36]  And Lord
[2101.36 --> 2102.06]  That is
[2102.06 --> 2103.16]  Our mission today
[2103.16 --> 2104.78]  And your spirit
[2104.78 --> 2106.00]  Still empowers us today
[2106.00 --> 2106.72]  And so Lord
[2106.72 --> 2107.98]  We pray that
[2107.98 --> 2108.66]  This morning
[2108.66 --> 2109.92]  As we come to your word
[2109.92 --> 2112.14]  That your same spirit
[2112.14 --> 2114.46]  Would open our eyes
[2114.46 --> 2115.82]  And open our hearts
[2115.82 --> 2117.52]  That as your servants
[2117.52 --> 2118.92]  That we would hear
[2118.92 --> 2119.80]  And that we would
[2119.80 --> 2121.18]  By your word
[2121.18 --> 2122.60]  Draw close to you
[2122.60 --> 2123.94]  To know you
[2123.94 --> 2124.80]  And know your heart
[2124.80 --> 2125.62]  And to be able
[2125.62 --> 2126.64]  To follow after you
[2126.64 --> 2127.82]  We pray
[2127.82 --> 2128.90]  In Jesus name
[2128.90 --> 2129.58]  Amen
[2129.58 --> 2135.32]  So what happened?
[2136.28 --> 2136.76]  Right?
[2136.88 --> 2137.56]  They ask
[2137.56 --> 2138.50]  What in the world
[2138.50 --> 2138.96]  Happened?
[2140.64 --> 2141.90]  And that's the right
[2141.90 --> 2142.38]  Question
[2142.38 --> 2144.02]  That we would ask
[2144.02 --> 2144.34]  You know
[2144.34 --> 2144.92]  If you
[2144.92 --> 2146.96]  Heard all of these
[2146.96 --> 2147.90]  Uneducated
[2147.90 --> 2148.72]  Galileans
[2148.72 --> 2149.90]  Speaking in the
[2149.90 --> 2150.56]  Native tongues
[2150.56 --> 2151.50]  Of people
[2151.50 --> 2152.16]  From all over
[2152.16 --> 2153.30]  The Mediterranean world
[2153.30 --> 2155.30]  What is going on?
[2155.40 --> 2156.42]  What on earth
[2156.42 --> 2157.42]  Is happening?
[2158.92 --> 2159.16]  You know
[2159.16 --> 2159.46]  Sometimes
[2159.46 --> 2160.38]  You might be
[2160.38 --> 2161.50]  Watching a sports game
[2161.50 --> 2162.42]  You're watching hockey
[2162.42 --> 2164.14]  And it's the middle
[2164.14 --> 2165.02]  Of the second period
[2165.02 --> 2166.50]  And neither team
[2166.50 --> 2167.40]  Has scored yet
[2167.40 --> 2169.08]  And of course
[2169.08 --> 2170.44]  The minute you look away
[2170.44 --> 2171.84]  Or you walk out
[2171.84 --> 2172.38]  Of the room
[2172.38 --> 2173.36]  To get a drink
[2173.36 --> 2175.08]  Suddenly you hear
[2175.08 --> 2175.90]  You know
[2175.90 --> 2177.16]  The crowd going wild
[2177.16 --> 2178.96]  And the Canucks
[2178.96 --> 2179.54]  Have scored
[2179.54 --> 2182.28]  And you missed it
[2182.28 --> 2182.68]  Right?
[2182.78 --> 2183.72]  You walk out of the room
[2183.72 --> 2184.54]  And you come in
[2184.54 --> 2184.98]  And you say
[2184.98 --> 2186.52]  What happened?
[2187.10 --> 2187.68]  What happened?
[2188.58 --> 2189.22]  And so you know
[2189.22 --> 2190.32]  Then we have instant replay
[2190.32 --> 2191.42]  So we can see what happened
[2191.42 --> 2192.48]  And we see it in slow motion
[2192.48 --> 2193.68]  And the announcers
[2193.68 --> 2195.56]  Will explain it to us
[2195.56 --> 2197.36]  Explain what happened
[2197.36 --> 2198.56]  We want to know
[2198.56 --> 2199.24]  What happened
[2199.24 --> 2200.64]  You know
[2200.64 --> 2202.44]  On Friday nights
[2202.44 --> 2203.16]  At my house
[2203.16 --> 2204.58]  We have pizza
[2204.58 --> 2205.42]  And watch a movie
[2205.42 --> 2207.14]  And lately
[2207.14 --> 2208.18]  We've been watching
[2208.18 --> 2209.48]  Star Wars
[2209.48 --> 2210.76]  And so we started
[2210.76 --> 2212.68]  At episode one
[2212.68 --> 2213.72]  And we've been watching
[2213.72 --> 2214.84]  All the way through
[2214.84 --> 2216.32]  Last night
[2216.32 --> 2217.44]  We watched episode six
[2217.44 --> 2220.46]  And it's been good
[2220.46 --> 2221.06]  And helpful
[2221.06 --> 2223.38]  Because I'm really bad
[2223.38 --> 2224.38]  At following plots
[2224.38 --> 2226.60]  And so maybe like
[2226.60 --> 2227.94]  Every 30 minutes
[2227.94 --> 2228.54]  In the movie
[2228.54 --> 2229.98]  I have to say
[2229.98 --> 2231.74]  Wait a second
[2231.74 --> 2232.32]  Pause
[2232.32 --> 2234.20]  What is happening?
[2234.20 --> 2235.92]  Somebody explain this to me
[2235.92 --> 2238.70]  We want to know
[2238.70 --> 2239.30]  What's happening
[2239.30 --> 2241.08]  2,000 years ago
[2241.08 --> 2242.54]  Jesus Christ came
[2242.54 --> 2244.96]  He had a small
[2244.96 --> 2246.24]  Group of gatherers
[2246.24 --> 2248.36]  In one small part
[2248.36 --> 2249.02]  Of the world
[2249.02 --> 2250.74]  Today
[2250.74 --> 2252.04]  Jesus has
[2252.04 --> 2253.12]  Something like
[2253.12 --> 2254.88]  2 billion followers
[2254.88 --> 2256.78]  All over the world
[2256.78 --> 2258.26]  You can almost
[2258.26 --> 2259.24]  Not go anywhere
[2259.24 --> 2259.98]  In the world
[2259.98 --> 2261.18]  Will you not find
[2261.18 --> 2262.38]  Followers of Jesus
[2262.38 --> 2263.98]  Whose lives have been
[2263.98 --> 2265.44]  Completely transformed
[2265.44 --> 2267.28]  They become
[2267.28 --> 2268.24]  Whole new people
[2268.24 --> 2269.48]  New communities
[2269.48 --> 2270.32]  New societies
[2270.32 --> 2272.04]  Because of
[2272.04 --> 2273.18]  This Jesus
[2273.18 --> 2275.42]  So don't you have to ask
[2275.42 --> 2277.14]  What happened?
[2277.72 --> 2277.98]  I mean
[2277.98 --> 2279.20]  What on earth
[2279.20 --> 2280.12]  Happened?
[2281.50 --> 2283.40]  And the answer is
[2283.40 --> 2285.04]  The Holy Spirit
[2285.04 --> 2285.62]  Happened
[2285.62 --> 2287.60]  Peter begins to explain
[2287.60 --> 2288.54]  That when the Spirit
[2288.54 --> 2289.64]  Came in power
[2289.64 --> 2291.40]  That this was actually
[2291.40 --> 2292.06]  A fulfillment
[2292.06 --> 2293.08]  Of an Old Testament
[2293.08 --> 2293.76]  Prophecy
[2293.76 --> 2296.36]  And it's a fulfillment
[2296.36 --> 2297.86]  Of the promise
[2297.86 --> 2298.66]  That Jesus
[2298.66 --> 2299.90]  Gave
[2299.90 --> 2301.20]  And this is
[2301.20 --> 2302.26]  What the presence
[2302.26 --> 2303.10]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2303.10 --> 2304.40]  Does in a person's life
[2304.40 --> 2305.70]  As we look at
[2305.70 --> 2306.76]  This early church
[2306.76 --> 2307.30]  And the Spirit
[2307.30 --> 2308.02]  Has come
[2308.02 --> 2309.70]  And it's empowering
[2309.70 --> 2311.44]  Peter and everybody
[2311.44 --> 2313.74]  To be a witness
[2313.74 --> 2315.56]  Of what God has done
[2315.56 --> 2316.34]  In their life
[2316.34 --> 2317.18]  What they have seen
[2317.18 --> 2317.74]  And heard
[2317.74 --> 2319.40]  That's what the Spirit
[2319.40 --> 2320.48]  Empowers us to do
[2320.48 --> 2323.88]  And so as the Spirit
[2323.88 --> 2324.40]  Comes
[2324.40 --> 2325.36]  What is the job
[2325.36 --> 2326.12]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2326.12 --> 2326.60]  Exactly?
[2327.46 --> 2328.24]  You know the Holy Spirit
[2328.24 --> 2329.50]  Has a lot of jobs
[2329.50 --> 2330.44]  A lot of roles
[2330.44 --> 2331.28]  That we see in Scripture
[2331.28 --> 2334.18]  But one of the big jobs
[2334.18 --> 2336.34]  Is to continually point
[2336.34 --> 2337.40]  To Jesus Christ
[2337.40 --> 2339.12]  The Spirit is kind of
[2339.12 --> 2340.18]  Like a spotlight
[2340.76 --> 2342.00]  Drawing our attention
[2342.00 --> 2343.50]  And drawing our hearts
[2343.50 --> 2346.26]  To the gospel of grace
[2346.26 --> 2347.64]  Which because
[2347.64 --> 2348.82]  Of Jesus' sacrifice
[2348.82 --> 2350.42]  Is real
[2350.42 --> 2351.74]  And is true
[2351.74 --> 2352.74]  And is available
[2352.74 --> 2354.20]  For you and for me
[2354.20 --> 2356.96]  And if you believe it
[2356.96 --> 2358.76]  If you are drawn
[2358.76 --> 2359.56]  To this gospel
[2359.56 --> 2361.20]  If you believe it
[2361.20 --> 2363.44]  It becomes who you are
[2363.44 --> 2364.34]  At the very center
[2364.34 --> 2365.14]  Of your being
[2365.14 --> 2366.68]  It becomes who you are
[2366.68 --> 2367.40]  Kind of underneath
[2367.40 --> 2368.38]  Everything else
[2368.38 --> 2369.12]  In your life
[2369.12 --> 2370.38]  And it gives you
[2370.38 --> 2371.40]  This whole new identity
[2371.40 --> 2372.88]  And it makes you
[2372.88 --> 2374.20]  A whole new person
[2374.20 --> 2376.98]  So let's talk about
[2376.98 --> 2378.38]  This movement
[2378.38 --> 2379.30]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2379.30 --> 2381.36]  And how he empowers
[2381.36 --> 2381.80]  Peter
[2381.80 --> 2383.16]  To be a witness
[2383.16 --> 2384.56]  And how he empowers
[2384.56 --> 2385.28]  Us to be a witness
[2385.28 --> 2386.82]  And so there's two things
[2386.82 --> 2388.22]  We see going on here
[2388.22 --> 2389.44]  First
[2389.44 --> 2390.44]  Peter says
[2390.44 --> 2392.20]  Let me tell you
[2392.20 --> 2392.74]  What's true
[2392.74 --> 2393.92]  Let me tell you
[2393.92 --> 2394.90]  What's happening here
[2394.90 --> 2396.94]  And then second
[2396.94 --> 2398.28]  He says
[2398.28 --> 2399.50]  Here's what you should
[2399.50 --> 2400.48]  Do in response
[2400.48 --> 2402.74]  Let me tell you
[2402.74 --> 2403.34]  What's true
[2403.34 --> 2405.04]  And here's what
[2405.04 --> 2405.62]  You should do
[2405.62 --> 2406.74]  So let's look
[2406.74 --> 2407.52]  At those two things
[2407.52 --> 2408.00]  First
[2408.00 --> 2409.32]  What is true
[2409.32 --> 2410.12]  Peter comes
[2410.12 --> 2410.68]  And he says
[2410.68 --> 2411.68]  Let me tell you
[2411.68 --> 2412.16]  What's true
[2412.16 --> 2414.38]  And actually
[2414.38 --> 2416.36]  He's doing here
[2416.36 --> 2417.80]  What he later
[2417.80 --> 2419.00]  Writes in 1st Peter
[2419.00 --> 2420.02]  Chapter 3
[2420.02 --> 2420.72]  Verse 15
[2420.72 --> 2422.52]  Where he writes
[2422.52 --> 2424.86]  Always be prepared
[2424.86 --> 2426.48]  To give an answer
[2426.48 --> 2427.18]  To everyone
[2427.18 --> 2427.92]  Who asks you
[2427.92 --> 2428.70]  To give the reason
[2428.70 --> 2429.38]  For the hope
[2429.38 --> 2430.18]  That you have
[2430.18 --> 2431.70]  But do this
[2431.70 --> 2432.46]  With gentleness
[2432.46 --> 2433.58]  And respect
[2433.58 --> 2435.90]  And so
[2435.90 --> 2436.68]  And so here
[2436.68 --> 2437.52]  Peter is
[2437.52 --> 2438.72]  And you know
[2438.72 --> 2439.16]  It's been
[2439.16 --> 2440.20]  An amazing day
[2440.20 --> 2440.68]  So far
[2440.68 --> 2441.48]  It's been
[2441.48 --> 2442.62]  Unlike anything
[2442.62 --> 2443.56]  That has ever
[2443.56 --> 2444.08]  Happened
[2444.08 --> 2446.02]  With the wind
[2446.02 --> 2447.18]  And the fire
[2447.18 --> 2448.44]  And being able
[2448.44 --> 2448.82]  To speak
[2448.82 --> 2449.72]  All of these languages
[2449.72 --> 2452.04]  And so the people
[2452.04 --> 2452.68]  Ask
[2452.68 --> 2454.26]  What does this mean
[2454.26 --> 2456.98]  And Peter
[2456.98 --> 2458.18]  Maybe he's thinking
[2458.18 --> 2459.72]  Who knows
[2459.72 --> 2460.38]  If he'll ever
[2460.38 --> 2461.18]  Get a chance
[2461.18 --> 2461.98]  Like this again
[2461.98 --> 2462.88]  To tell the story
[2462.88 --> 2463.40]  Of Jesus
[2463.40 --> 2464.74]  You know
[2464.74 --> 2466.22]  For all he knows
[2466.22 --> 2467.54]  This is it
[2467.54 --> 2468.22]  There might not
[2468.22 --> 2468.76]  Ever be
[2468.76 --> 2469.94]  Another chance
[2469.94 --> 2471.24]  Like he has
[2471.24 --> 2471.82]  Right now
[2471.82 --> 2473.06]  And so
[2473.06 --> 2474.12]  Whatever he's going
[2474.12 --> 2474.78]  To say
[2474.78 --> 2475.68]  In this moment
[2475.68 --> 2477.30]  It should be
[2477.30 --> 2478.44]  The absolute
[2478.44 --> 2479.22]  Essentials
[2479.22 --> 2479.38]  Right
[2479.38 --> 2480.14]  It should be
[2480.14 --> 2481.66]  Nothing extra
[2481.66 --> 2482.48]  You know
[2482.48 --> 2483.04]  Nothing
[2483.04 --> 2484.38]  Secondary
[2484.38 --> 2485.54]  Simply
[2485.54 --> 2487.26]  The heart
[2487.26 --> 2488.16]  Of what Peter
[2488.16 --> 2488.94]  Has seen
[2488.94 --> 2490.50]  And what he has
[2490.50 --> 2490.88]  Heard
[2490.88 --> 2491.74]  And what he knows
[2491.74 --> 2492.32]  To be true
[2492.32 --> 2494.38]  And so what does
[2494.38 --> 2495.16]  The Holy Spirit
[2495.16 --> 2497.50]  This helper
[2497.50 --> 2499.00]  As he's called
[2499.00 --> 2499.82]  In the gospels
[2499.82 --> 2501.16]  What does the Holy Spirit
[2501.16 --> 2502.06]  Empower Peter
[2502.06 --> 2502.52]  To say
[2502.52 --> 2504.18]  It's the first sermon
[2504.18 --> 2505.24]  Ever in the church
[2505.24 --> 2506.98]  And what he says
[2506.98 --> 2508.66]  Is essentially
[2508.66 --> 2509.56]  The meaning
[2509.56 --> 2510.30]  Of Christianity
[2510.30 --> 2511.94]  What does it all
[2511.94 --> 2512.76]  Hang on
[2512.76 --> 2514.50]  So Peter says
[2514.50 --> 2514.86]  To them
[2514.86 --> 2517.22]  This man
[2517.22 --> 2517.62]  Jesus
[2517.62 --> 2519.34]  Is God
[2519.34 --> 2520.66]  And he did
[2520.66 --> 2521.20]  All of these
[2521.20 --> 2522.26]  Signs and wonders
[2522.26 --> 2523.44]  He suffered
[2523.44 --> 2524.48]  A terrible death
[2524.48 --> 2525.12]  By the hands
[2525.12 --> 2525.90]  Of wicked men
[2525.90 --> 2526.92]  But then God
[2526.92 --> 2527.40]  Raised him
[2527.40 --> 2528.06]  From the dead
[2528.06 --> 2529.02]  He ascended
[2529.02 --> 2529.74]  Into heaven
[2529.74 --> 2530.44]  And he is
[2530.44 --> 2531.64]  And God has made
[2531.64 --> 2532.80]  Him both Lord
[2532.80 --> 2533.78]  And Messiah
[2533.78 --> 2535.08]  And now he has
[2535.08 --> 2535.74]  Poured out his
[2535.74 --> 2536.32]  Holy Spirit
[2536.32 --> 2537.42]  And it has
[2537.42 --> 2538.88]  Fallen on us
[2538.88 --> 2540.36]  That's what's
[2540.36 --> 2540.70]  Happened
[2540.70 --> 2541.28]  That's what's
[2541.28 --> 2541.94]  Going on
[2541.94 --> 2542.98]  So that's
[2542.98 --> 2543.30]  What Peter
[2543.30 --> 2543.92]  Talks about
[2543.92 --> 2545.28]  He says it
[2545.28 --> 2546.14]  With words
[2546.14 --> 2547.42]  That the Holy Spirit
[2547.42 --> 2548.30]  Empowered him
[2548.30 --> 2549.46]  To say
[2549.46 --> 2550.58]  And that gave him
[2550.58 --> 2551.02]  To say
[2551.02 --> 2552.40]  But also
[2552.40 --> 2553.38]  Peter is
[2553.38 --> 2554.20]  Drawing on his
[2554.20 --> 2555.04]  Own experiences
[2555.04 --> 2555.98]  In his own life
[2555.98 --> 2558.14]  And I want us
[2558.14 --> 2558.46]  To notice
[2558.46 --> 2559.20]  Two things
[2559.20 --> 2559.98]  About what
[2559.98 --> 2560.70]  Peter says
[2560.70 --> 2562.82]  First
[2562.82 --> 2563.70]  Nowhere
[2563.70 --> 2564.42]  Does Peter
[2564.42 --> 2564.96]  Say
[2564.96 --> 2566.08]  If you're
[2566.08 --> 2566.44]  Going to be
[2566.44 --> 2566.94]  A Christian
[2566.94 --> 2568.02]  Just
[2568.02 --> 2569.40]  Close your
[2569.40 --> 2570.12]  Eyes
[2570.12 --> 2570.76]  And just
[2570.76 --> 2571.28]  Go with it
[2571.28 --> 2571.56]  Just let
[2571.56 --> 2572.40]  The Holy Spirit
[2572.40 --> 2573.30]  Move you
[2573.30 --> 2574.26]  That's not
[2574.26 --> 2574.92]  What he says
[2574.92 --> 2576.04]  He says
[2576.04 --> 2576.58]  You must
[2576.58 --> 2577.16]  Believe
[2577.16 --> 2578.50]  Because it
[2578.50 --> 2578.96]  Is true
[2578.96 --> 2579.46]  This is
[2579.46 --> 2579.82]  What is
[2579.82 --> 2580.12]  True
[2580.12 --> 2581.08]  And if
[2581.08 --> 2581.56]  You don't
[2581.56 --> 2581.88]  Believe
[2581.88 --> 2583.22]  That is
[2583.22 --> 2583.58]  True
[2583.58 --> 2584.54]  If you
[2584.54 --> 2584.82]  Don't
[2584.82 --> 2585.08]  Believe
[2585.08 --> 2585.56]  That Jesus
[2585.56 --> 2586.08]  Is God
[2586.08 --> 2586.34]  And that
[2586.34 --> 2586.54]  God
[2586.54 --> 2587.02]  Raised him
[2587.02 --> 2587.34]  From the
[2587.34 --> 2587.66]  Dead
[2587.66 --> 2588.98]  Then you're
[2588.98 --> 2589.32]  Not a
[2589.32 --> 2589.62]  Christian
[2589.62 --> 2590.20]  Because this
[2590.20 --> 2590.70]  Is what
[2590.70 --> 2591.36]  It means
[2591.36 --> 2592.00]  To be
[2592.00 --> 2592.46]  A follower
[2592.46 --> 2593.04]  Of Christ
[2593.04 --> 2593.60]  You believe
[2593.60 --> 2593.98]  This
[2593.98 --> 2595.48]  So look
[2595.48 --> 2595.82]  At verse
[2595.82 --> 2596.42]  32
[2596.42 --> 2598.70]  God
[2598.70 --> 2599.56]  Has raised
[2599.56 --> 2600.24]  This Jesus
[2600.24 --> 2601.08]  To life
[2601.08 --> 2601.98]  And we
[2601.98 --> 2602.46]  Are all
[2602.46 --> 2603.10]  Witnesses
[2603.10 --> 2603.64]  Of it
[2603.64 --> 2605.02]  So kind
[2605.02 --> 2605.36]  Of put
[2605.36 --> 2605.78]  In another
[2605.78 --> 2606.18]  Way
[2606.18 --> 2607.56]  The resurrection
[2607.56 --> 2608.28]  Happened
[2608.28 --> 2609.66]  It's real
[2609.66 --> 2610.58]  We saw
[2610.58 --> 2610.84]  It
[2610.84 --> 2613.30]  So first
[2613.30 --> 2613.66]  You have
[2613.66 --> 2614.04]  To believe
[2614.04 --> 2614.58]  It's true
[2614.58 --> 2616.04]  And so
[2616.04 --> 2616.54]  Christianity
[2616.54 --> 2617.10]  Is something
[2617.10 --> 2617.80]  That we
[2617.80 --> 2618.88]  Can believe
[2618.88 --> 2619.60]  There's evidence
[2619.60 --> 2620.12]  For it
[2620.12 --> 2621.40]  It's reasonable
[2621.40 --> 2623.28]  But second
[2623.28 --> 2623.82]  Notice
[2623.82 --> 2624.46]  What else
[2624.46 --> 2625.22]  Peter does
[2625.22 --> 2626.86]  He is
[2626.86 --> 2627.54]  In effect
[2627.54 --> 2627.98]  As he
[2627.98 --> 2628.44]  Gives the
[2628.44 --> 2628.86]  Sermon
[2628.86 --> 2629.78]  He's kind
[2629.78 --> 2630.38]  Of turning
[2630.38 --> 2630.84]  Up the
[2630.84 --> 2631.52]  Contrast
[2631.52 --> 2632.32]  Right
[2632.32 --> 2632.88]  He's turning
[2632.88 --> 2633.20]  Up the
[2633.20 --> 2633.72]  Contrast
[2633.72 --> 2634.02]  In a
[2634.02 --> 2634.40]  Way
[2634.40 --> 2635.64]  That would
[2635.64 --> 2636.22]  Be pretty
[2636.22 --> 2637.18]  Countercultural
[2637.18 --> 2638.22]  Not only
[2638.22 --> 2638.84]  Today but
[2638.84 --> 2639.54]  Also back
[2639.54 --> 2640.04]  In his
[2640.04 --> 2640.38]  Time
[2640.38 --> 2641.82]  He's turning
[2641.82 --> 2642.26]  Up the
[2642.26 --> 2642.88]  Contrast
[2642.88 --> 2643.34]  On how
[2643.34 --> 2644.00]  What Christians
[2644.00 --> 2644.50]  Believe
[2644.50 --> 2646.16]  Is actually
[2646.16 --> 2646.80]  Different
[2646.80 --> 2647.70]  From what
[2647.70 --> 2648.24]  Everybody
[2648.24 --> 2648.76]  Else
[2648.76 --> 2649.20]  Believes
[2649.20 --> 2649.72]  Whether it's
[2649.72 --> 2650.26]  The Jews
[2650.26 --> 2650.78]  Or the
[2650.78 --> 2651.22]  Pagans
[2651.22 --> 2651.64]  Of the
[2651.64 --> 2652.22]  Roman Empire
[2652.22 --> 2653.70]  So he's
[2653.70 --> 2654.24]  Not seeking
[2654.24 --> 2655.10]  To turn
[2655.10 --> 2655.56]  Down the
[2655.56 --> 2656.18]  Contrast
[2656.18 --> 2656.94]  He's not
[2656.94 --> 2657.46]  Stressing
[2657.46 --> 2658.72]  Commonalities
[2658.72 --> 2659.84]  You know
[2659.84 --> 2660.20]  He's not
[2660.20 --> 2661.10]  Highlighting
[2661.10 --> 2662.30]  What the
[2662.30 --> 2663.00]  Followers of
[2663.00 --> 2663.36]  Jesus
[2663.36 --> 2664.72]  Believe that
[2664.72 --> 2665.66]  Everyone else
[2665.66 --> 2666.34]  Believes too
[2666.34 --> 2668.02]  So he's not
[2668.02 --> 2668.52]  Saying
[2668.52 --> 2669.84]  Hey let's
[2669.84 --> 2670.38]  Just stress
[2670.38 --> 2670.92]  What we
[2670.92 --> 2671.64]  All agree
[2671.64 --> 2671.94]  On
[2671.94 --> 2672.18]  Right
[2672.18 --> 2672.68]  You know
[2672.68 --> 2673.04]  We all
[2673.04 --> 2673.42]  Have our
[2673.42 --> 2674.14]  Own ways
[2674.14 --> 2674.66]  Of finding
[2674.66 --> 2675.14]  God
[2675.14 --> 2675.66]  And that's
[2675.66 --> 2676.00]  What really
[2676.00 --> 2676.56]  Matters
[2676.56 --> 2677.76]  No he's
[2677.76 --> 2678.42]  Not doing
[2678.42 --> 2678.78]  That
[2678.78 --> 2680.00]  He's turning
[2680.00 --> 2680.44]  Up the
[2680.44 --> 2681.10]  Contrast
[2681.10 --> 2682.02]  He's
[2682.02 --> 2682.30]  Actually
[2682.30 --> 2682.72]  Saying
[2682.72 --> 2683.12]  Words
[2683.12 --> 2683.58]  Like
[2683.58 --> 2685.32]  Repent
[2685.32 --> 2686.38]  And believe
[2686.38 --> 2686.78]  You need
[2686.78 --> 2688.12]  To go
[2688.12 --> 2689.06]  From what
[2689.06 --> 2689.66]  You currently
[2689.66 --> 2690.26]  Think as
[2690.26 --> 2690.80]  Reality
[2690.80 --> 2691.28]  And you
[2691.28 --> 2691.72]  Need to
[2691.72 --> 2692.44]  See a
[2692.44 --> 2692.92]  Whole new
[2692.92 --> 2693.52]  Reality
[2693.52 --> 2694.20]  You need
[2694.20 --> 2694.64]  To be
[2694.64 --> 2695.18]  Completely
[2695.18 --> 2695.72]  Changed
[2695.72 --> 2696.02]  From the
[2696.02 --> 2696.38]  Inside
[2696.38 --> 2696.84]  Out
[2696.84 --> 2697.60]  The world
[2697.60 --> 2697.88]  Turned
[2697.88 --> 2698.24]  Upside
[2698.24 --> 2698.58]  Down
[2698.58 --> 2699.02]  Which is
[2699.02 --> 2699.26]  Right
[2699.26 --> 2699.48]  Side
[2699.48 --> 2699.92]  Up
[2699.92 --> 2700.68]  Everything
[2700.68 --> 2701.20]  Has to
[2701.20 --> 2701.34]  Be
[2701.34 --> 2701.66]  Different
[2701.66 --> 2703.26]  He says
[2703.26 --> 2703.84]  Be
[2703.84 --> 2704.52]  Baptized
[2704.52 --> 2704.86]  Every
[2704.86 --> 2705.24]  One
[2705.24 --> 2705.36]  Of
[2705.36 --> 2705.48]  You
[2705.48 --> 2705.60]  In
[2705.60 --> 2705.76]  The
[2705.76 --> 2706.00]  Name
[2706.00 --> 2706.20]  Of
[2706.20 --> 2706.58]  Jesus
[2706.58 --> 2707.72]  Because
[2707.72 --> 2708.20]  You
[2708.20 --> 2708.76]  Are
[2708.76 --> 2709.00]  A
[2709.00 --> 2709.32]  Sinner
[2709.32 --> 2709.46]  You
[2709.46 --> 2709.62]  Have
[2709.62 --> 2710.22]  Rejected
[2710.22 --> 2710.58]  God
[2710.58 --> 2711.78]  And you
[2711.78 --> 2712.10]  Need
[2712.10 --> 2712.40]  To be
[2712.40 --> 2712.82]  Forgiven
[2712.82 --> 2714.50]  He's
[2714.50 --> 2714.82]  Actually
[2714.82 --> 2715.14]  Saying
[2715.14 --> 2715.40]  Those
[2715.40 --> 2715.84]  Words
[2715.84 --> 2716.92]  Which are
[2716.92 --> 2717.30]  Very
[2717.30 --> 2718.54]  Contrasty
[2718.54 --> 2718.78]  Kind
[2718.78 --> 2718.88]  Of
[2718.88 --> 2719.32]  Words
[2719.32 --> 2720.04]  They're
[2720.04 --> 2720.42]  Very
[2720.42 --> 2721.70]  You know
[2721.70 --> 2721.86]  And
[2721.86 --> 2722.14]  Is
[2722.14 --> 2722.34]  Very
[2722.34 --> 2723.32]  Confident
[2723.32 --> 2724.28]  About
[2724.28 --> 2724.54]  What
[2724.54 --> 2724.74]  Is
[2724.74 --> 2725.04]  True
[2725.04 --> 2727.08]  And
[2727.08 --> 2727.46]  Notice
[2727.46 --> 2727.94]  And
[2727.94 --> 2728.06]  We
[2728.06 --> 2728.26]  Should
[2728.26 --> 2728.54]  Notice
[2728.54 --> 2728.90]  This
[2728.90 --> 2729.14]  That
[2729.14 --> 2729.44]  He's
[2729.44 --> 2729.68]  Doing
[2729.68 --> 2729.92]  This
[2729.92 --> 2730.02]  In
[2730.02 --> 2730.12]  A
[2730.12 --> 2730.92]  Context
[2730.92 --> 2731.90]  That's
[2731.90 --> 2732.16]  Very
[2732.16 --> 2732.96]  Pluralistic
[2732.96 --> 2734.30]  Perhaps
[2734.30 --> 2735.14]  Even
[2735.14 --> 2735.50]  More
[2735.50 --> 2736.40]  Pluralistic
[2736.40 --> 2736.78]  Than
[2736.78 --> 2737.12]  Our
[2737.12 --> 2737.74]  Context
[2737.74 --> 2738.12]  Today
[2738.12 --> 2738.30]  In
[2738.30 --> 2738.72]  Vancouver
[2738.72 --> 2740.02]  Because
[2740.02 --> 2740.24]  The
[2740.24 --> 2740.94]  Greco-Roman
[2740.94 --> 2741.40]  World
[2741.40 --> 2741.78]  Was
[2741.78 --> 2742.66]  Incredibly
[2742.66 --> 2743.24]  Diverse
[2743.24 --> 2743.88]  Spiritually
[2743.88 --> 2744.74]  And
[2744.74 --> 2744.86]  The
[2744.86 --> 2745.32]  Roman
[2745.32 --> 2745.78]  Empire
[2745.78 --> 2746.04]  Had
[2746.04 --> 2746.40]  Pulled
[2746.40 --> 2746.58]  Off
[2746.58 --> 2746.90]  Something
[2746.90 --> 2747.18]  That
[2747.18 --> 2747.36]  Has
[2747.36 --> 2747.56]  Never
[2747.56 --> 2747.76]  Been
[2747.76 --> 2748.00]  Seen
[2748.00 --> 2748.14]  In
[2748.14 --> 2748.52]  History
[2748.52 --> 2749.30]  Which
[2749.30 --> 2749.46]  Is
[2749.46 --> 2749.60]  That
[2749.60 --> 2749.74]  They
[2749.74 --> 2749.94]  Had
[2749.94 --> 2750.16]  Brought
[2750.16 --> 2750.62]  Together
[2750.62 --> 2750.88]  A
[2750.88 --> 2751.54]  Diverse
[2751.54 --> 2752.62]  Group
[2752.62 --> 2752.82]  Of
[2752.82 --> 2753.32]  Cultures
[2753.32 --> 2753.54]  And
[2753.54 --> 2754.22]  Religions
[2754.22 --> 2754.46]  And
[2754.46 --> 2755.02]  Beliefs
[2755.02 --> 2756.20]  In
[2756.20 --> 2756.36]  A
[2756.36 --> 2756.54]  Way
[2756.54 --> 2756.70]  That
[2756.70 --> 2756.84]  The
[2756.84 --> 2757.02]  World
[2757.02 --> 2757.22]  Had
[2757.22 --> 2757.48]  Never
[2757.48 --> 2757.76]  Seen
[2757.76 --> 2758.14]  Before
[2758.14 --> 2759.02]  So
[2759.02 --> 2759.16]  They
[2759.16 --> 2759.34]  Had
[2759.34 --> 2759.76]  People
[2759.76 --> 2760.58]  In
[2760.58 --> 2760.72]  The
[2760.72 --> 2760.92]  Roman
[2760.92 --> 2761.34]  Empire
[2761.34 --> 2761.58]  Who
[2761.58 --> 2762.02]  Worshipped
[2762.02 --> 2762.30]  All
[2762.30 --> 2762.56]  Kinds
[2762.56 --> 2762.64]  Of
[2762.64 --> 2762.88]  Different
[2762.88 --> 2763.52]  Gods
[2763.52 --> 2763.74]  And
[2763.74 --> 2763.88]  All
[2763.88 --> 2764.06]  The
[2764.06 --> 2764.40]  Greek
[2764.40 --> 2764.60]  And
[2764.60 --> 2764.82]  Roman
[2764.82 --> 2765.44]  Gods
[2765.44 --> 2766.12]  That
[2766.12 --> 2766.24]  We
[2766.24 --> 2766.46]  Know
[2766.46 --> 2766.80]  About
[2766.80 --> 2767.02]  All
[2767.02 --> 2767.16]  These
[2767.16 --> 2767.42]  Different
[2767.42 --> 2768.36]  Philosophies
[2768.36 --> 2768.56]  That
[2768.56 --> 2768.66]  They
[2768.66 --> 2769.30]  Followed
[2769.30 --> 2770.56]  And
[2770.56 --> 2770.66]  So
[2770.66 --> 2770.76]  It
[2770.76 --> 2770.78]  Is
[2770.78 --> 2771.12]  Tempting
[2771.12 --> 2771.32]  For
[2771.32 --> 2771.60]  Us
[2771.60 --> 2771.76]  To
[2771.76 --> 2771.98]  Say
[2771.98 --> 2772.24]  That
[2772.24 --> 2772.62]  It
[2772.62 --> 2772.76]  Has
[2772.76 --> 2773.00]  Never
[2773.00 --> 2773.20]  Been
[2773.20 --> 2773.66]  Harder
[2773.66 --> 2773.86]  Than
[2773.86 --> 2774.48]  Today
[2774.48 --> 2775.16]  To

[2779.02 --> 2779.28]  What
[2779.28 --> 2779.44]  Is
[2779.44 --> 2779.76]  True
[2779.76 --> 2779.94]  And
[2779.94 --> 2780.06]  What
[2780.06 --> 2780.16]  Is
[2780.16 --> 2780.54]  Not
[2780.54 --> 2781.32]  We
[2781.32 --> 2781.62]  Say
[2781.62 --> 2781.98]  Things
[2781.98 --> 2782.24]  Like
[2782.24 --> 2782.34]  You
[2782.34 --> 2782.44]  Know
[2782.44 --> 2782.72]  In
[2782.72 --> 2783.62]  Today
[2783.62 --> 2785.00]  To
[2785.00 --> 2785.24]  Be
[2785.24 --> 2785.82]  Deeply
[2785.82 --> 2786.28]  Rooted
[2786.28 --> 2786.68]  In
[2786.68 --> 2787.34]  Convictions
[2787.34 --> 2787.64]  About
[2787.64 --> 2787.84]  What
[2787.84 --> 2788.02]  Is
[2788.02 --> 2788.38]  True
[2788.38 --> 2788.66]  You
[2788.66 --> 2788.76]  Know
[2788.76 --> 2789.02]  It's
[2789.02 --> 2789.22]  Never
[2789.22 --> 2789.44]  Been
[2789.44 --> 2789.86]  Harder
[2789.86 --> 2790.10]  To
[2790.10 --> 2790.28]  Do
[2790.28 --> 2790.54]  That
[2790.54 --> 2792.50]  But
[2792.50 --> 2792.78]  That's
[2792.78 --> 2792.98]  Not
[2792.98 --> 2793.14]  The
[2793.14 --> 2793.54]  Case
[2793.54 --> 2794.38]  Historically
[2794.38 --> 2795.72]  And
[2795.72 --> 2796.22]  Yet
[2796.22 --> 2797.04]  In
[2797.04 --> 2797.30]  This
[2797.30 --> 2797.88]  Environment
[2797.88 --> 2798.44]  That
[2798.44 --> 2798.68]  Is
[2798.68 --> 2799.16]  Deeply
[2799.16 --> 2800.00]  Pluralistic
[2800.00 --> 2800.92]  Christianity
[2800.92 --> 2802.02]  Just
[2802.02 --> 2802.50]  Took
[2802.50 --> 2803.08]  Off
[2803.08 --> 2803.50]  It
[2803.50 --> 2804.06]  Spread

[2804.28 --> 2805.04]  Wildfire
[2805.04 --> 2805.64]  It
[2805.64 --> 2806.20]  Flourished
[2806.20 --> 2806.38]  And
[2806.38 --> 2806.50]  It
[2806.50 --> 2806.70]  Grew
[2806.70 --> 2807.98]  And
[2807.98 --> 2808.22]  So
[2808.22 --> 2808.88]  Why
[2808.88 --> 2809.04]  Did
[2809.04 --> 2809.16]  That
[2809.16 --> 2809.46]  Happen
[2809.46 --> 2809.68]  How

[2810.54 --> 2811.20]  You
[2811.20 --> 2811.30]  Know
[2811.30 --> 2811.58]  What
[2811.58 --> 2811.78]  Would
[2811.78 --> 2812.24]  Cause
[2812.24 --> 2812.42]  At
[2812.42 --> 2812.56]  The
[2812.56 --> 2812.72]  End
[2812.72 --> 2812.82]  Of

[2814.90 --> 2815.20]  Three
[2815.20 --> 2815.68]  Thousand
[2815.68 --> 2815.88]  At

[2816.32 --> 2817.40]  Unconvinced
[2817.40 --> 2818.46]  Skeptics
[2818.46 --> 2818.66]  Of

[2818.84 --> 2819.28]  Christians
[2819.28 --> 2819.60]  And
[2819.60 --> 2820.12]  What
[2820.12 --> 2820.42]  This
[2820.42 --> 2820.60]  Who
[2820.60 --> 2820.78]  This
[2820.78 --> 2821.04]  Jesus
[2821.04 --> 2821.48]  Is
[2821.48 --> 2822.64]  Convinced
[2822.64 --> 2823.14]  Them
[2823.14 --> 2823.96]  To
[2823.96 --> 2824.54]  Believe
[2824.54 --> 2824.86]  And
[2824.86 --> 2824.92]  To
[2824.92 --> 2825.06]  Be
[2825.06 --> 2825.46]  Added
[2825.46 --> 2825.62]  To
[2825.62 --> 2825.82]  The
[2825.82 --> 2826.08]  Church
[2826.08 --> 2826.26]  To
[2826.26 --> 2826.44]  Become
[2826.44 --> 2826.96]  Followers
[2826.96 --> 2827.10]  Of
[2827.10 --> 2827.46]  Jesus
[2827.46 --> 2829.92]  Peter
[2829.92 --> 2830.44]  Says
[2830.44 --> 2831.14]  God
[2831.14 --> 2831.88]  Raised
[2831.88 --> 2832.34]  Jesus
[2832.34 --> 2832.70]  From
[2832.70 --> 2832.92]  The
[2832.92 --> 2833.28]  Dead
[2833.28 --> 2833.46]  And
[2833.46 --> 2833.64]  Of
[2833.64 --> 2833.90]  That
[2833.90 --> 2834.14]  We
[2834.14 --> 2834.38]  Are
[2834.38 --> 2835.22]  Witnesses
[2835.22 --> 2836.50]  Right
[2836.50 --> 2836.68]  We're
[2836.68 --> 2837.04]  Not
[2837.04 --> 2838.32]  Philosophers
[2838.32 --> 2838.66]  Who
[2838.66 --> 2839.78]  Reached
[2839.78 --> 2839.98]  An
[2839.98 --> 2840.72]  Idea
[2840.72 --> 2841.20]  About
[2841.20 --> 2841.86]  Reality
[2841.86 --> 2842.76]  We
[2842.76 --> 2842.98]  Are
[2842.98 --> 2843.98]  Witnesses
[2843.98 --> 2844.16]  It
[2844.16 --> 2844.54]  Says
[2844.54 --> 2845.20]  To
[2845.20 --> 2845.50]  Whom
[2845.50 --> 2846.14]  Reality
[2846.14 --> 2846.74]  Has
[2846.74 --> 2847.26]  Come
[2847.26 --> 2848.26]  It
[2848.26 --> 2848.42]  Has
[2848.42 --> 2848.62]  Come
[2848.62 --> 2848.80]  To
[2848.80 --> 2848.94]  Us
[2848.94 --> 2849.08]  We
[2849.08 --> 2849.26]  Weren't
[2849.26 --> 2849.50]  Even
[2849.50 --> 2850.10]  Searching
[2850.10 --> 2850.36]  For
[2850.36 --> 2850.48]  It
[2850.48 --> 2850.60]  We
[2850.60 --> 2850.78]  Weren't
[2850.78 --> 2850.96]  Trying
[2850.96 --> 2851.12]  To
[2851.12 --> 2851.38]  Figure
[2851.38 --> 2851.64]  Out
[2851.64 --> 2851.94]  The
[2851.94 --> 2852.72]  You
[2852.72 --> 2852.80]  Know
[2852.80 --> 2852.96]  The
[2852.96 --> 2853.24]  Nature
[2853.24 --> 2853.38]  Of
[2853.38 --> 2853.48]  The
[2853.48 --> 2853.86]  Universe
[2853.86 --> 2854.60]  We
[2854.60 --> 2854.76]  Were
[2854.76 --> 2855.50]  Witnesses
[2855.50 --> 2855.64]  To
[2855.64 --> 2856.06]  God
[2856.06 --> 2856.84]  Coming
[2856.84 --> 2858.02]  Raising
[2858.02 --> 2858.32]  Jesus
[2858.32 --> 2858.56]  From
[2858.56 --> 2858.74]  The
[2858.74 --> 2859.08]  Dead
[2859.08 --> 2859.96]  Signs
[2859.96 --> 2860.12]  And
[2860.12 --> 2860.64]  Wonders
[2860.64 --> 2861.78]  And
[2861.78 --> 2861.92]  Our
[2861.92 --> 2862.16]  Own
[2862.16 --> 2862.54]  Lives
[2862.54 --> 2862.70]  Have
[2862.70 --> 2862.82]  Been
[2862.82 --> 2863.50]  Transformed
[2863.50 --> 2865.34]  Is
[2865.34 --> 2865.44]  It
[2865.44 --> 2865.80]  True
[2865.80 --> 2867.64]  Peter
[2867.64 --> 2867.92]  Says
[2867.92 --> 2868.10]  I
[2868.10 --> 2868.54]  Saw
[2868.54 --> 2868.80]  Him
[2868.80 --> 2869.94]  Right
[2869.94 --> 2870.18]  I
[2870.18 --> 2870.52]  Ran
[2870.52 --> 2870.82]  Into
[2870.82 --> 2871.06]  That
[2871.06 --> 2871.44]  Tomb
[2871.44 --> 2872.32]  I
[2872.32 --> 2872.80]  Looked
[2872.80 --> 2872.90]  And
[2872.90 --> 2873.08]  I
[2873.08 --> 2873.42]  Saw
[2873.42 --> 2873.96]  The
[2873.96 --> 2874.36]  Grave
[2874.36 --> 2874.86]  Clothes
[2874.86 --> 2875.08]  But
[2875.08 --> 2875.32]  No
[2875.32 --> 2875.74]  Body
[2875.74 --> 2877.24]  Later
[2877.24 --> 2877.80]  I
[2877.80 --> 2878.18]  Saw
[2878.18 --> 2878.40]  Him
[2878.40 --> 2878.86]  Myself
[2878.86 --> 2879.54]  Alive
[2879.54 --> 2879.90]  After
[2879.90 --> 2880.10]  I
[2880.10 --> 2880.34]  Saw
[2880.34 --> 2880.56]  Him
[2880.56 --> 2881.06]  Die
[2881.06 --> 2881.78]  He
[2881.78 --> 2881.92]  Was
[2881.92 --> 2882.36]  Alive
[2882.36 --> 2882.74]  I
[2882.74 --> 2883.00]  Saw
[2883.00 --> 2883.20]  Him
[2883.20 --> 2883.48]  Sit
[2883.48 --> 2883.72]  Down
[2883.72 --> 2883.88]  And
[2883.88 --> 2884.02]  Eat
[2884.02 --> 2884.18]  A
[2884.18 --> 2884.46]  Fish
[2884.46 --> 2884.96]  I
[2884.96 --> 2885.46]  Talked
[2885.46 --> 2885.64]  To
[2885.64 --> 2885.92]  Him
[2885.92 --> 2887.30]  That's
[2887.30 --> 2887.42]  Not
[2887.42 --> 2887.56]  A
[2887.56 --> 2888.18]  Philosophy
[2888.18 --> 2889.20]  That's
[2889.20 --> 2889.44]  What
[2889.44 --> 2889.68]  I
[2889.68 --> 2890.20]  Saw
[2890.20 --> 2891.70]  And
[2891.70 --> 2891.84]  So
[2891.84 --> 2892.30]  Christianity
[2892.30 --> 2893.22]  Invites
[2893.22 --> 2893.40]  Us
[2893.40 --> 2893.60]  To
[2893.60 --> 2894.00]  Look
[2894.00 --> 2895.12]  At
[2895.12 --> 2895.30]  The
[2895.30 --> 2895.88]  Reasoning
[2895.88 --> 2896.54]  And
[2896.54 --> 2896.66]  To
[2896.66 --> 2896.86]  Look
[2896.86 --> 2897.00]  At
[2897.00 --> 2897.16]  The
[2897.16 --> 2897.62]  Evidence
[2897.62 --> 2897.84]  Of
[2897.84 --> 2897.98]  The
[2897.98 --> 2898.32]  Faith
[2898.32 --> 2898.48]  And
[2898.48 --> 2898.58]  We
[2898.58 --> 2898.72]  Can
[2898.72 --> 2899.00]  Ask
[2899.00 --> 2899.68]  Questions
[2899.68 --> 2900.70]  And
[2900.70 --> 2900.86]  We
[2900.86 --> 2901.02]  Can
[2901.02 --> 2901.44]  Find
[2901.44 --> 2901.68]  Some
[2901.68 --> 2901.88]  Good
[2901.88 --> 2902.36]  Answers
[2902.36 --> 2903.94]  But
[2903.94 --> 2904.50]  Ultimately
[2904.50 --> 2905.40]  That's
[2905.40 --> 2905.60]  Not
[2905.60 --> 2905.98]  Enough
[2905.98 --> 2908.82]  Because
[2908.82 --> 2908.84]  Because
[2908.84 --> 2909.22]  You
[2909.22 --> 2909.76]  Don't
[2909.76 --> 2910.30]  Come
[2910.30 --> 2910.52]  To
[2910.52 --> 2911.02]  Faith
[2911.02 --> 2911.90]  And
[2911.90 --> 2912.02]  You
[2912.02 --> 2912.32]  Don't
[2912.32 --> 2912.58]  Then
[2912.58 --> 2913.04]  Grow
[2913.04 --> 2913.34]  In
[2913.34 --> 2913.80]  Faith
[2913.80 --> 2914.10]  Just
[2914.10 --> 2914.40]  By
[2914.40 --> 2915.26]  Reasoning
[2915.26 --> 2915.76]  And
[2915.76 --> 2916.40]  Examining
[2916.40 --> 2917.04]  Evidence
[2917.04 --> 2918.46]  We
[2918.46 --> 2918.72]  Can
[2918.72 --> 2919.04]  Take
[2919.04 --> 2919.50]  Steps
[2919.50 --> 2919.66]  To
[2919.66 --> 2920.04]  God
[2920.04 --> 2920.20]  And
[2920.20 --> 2920.76]  Ultimately
[2920.76 --> 2921.30]  Meet
[2921.30 --> 2921.88]  God
[2921.88 --> 2922.80]  Because
[2922.80 --> 2923.36]  He
[2923.36 --> 2923.58]  Has
[2923.58 --> 2923.98]  Already
[2923.98 --> 2924.32]  Come
[2924.32 --> 2924.46]  To
[2924.46 --> 2924.84]  Us
[2924.84 --> 2925.70]  Right
[2925.70 --> 2926.00]  He's
[2926.00 --> 2926.46]  Already
[2926.46 --> 2927.74]  Traveled
[2927.74 --> 2927.96]  All
[2927.96 --> 2928.16]  That
[2928.16 --> 2928.62]  Distance
[2928.62 --> 2928.92]  And
[2928.92 --> 2929.52]  Bridged
[2929.52 --> 2929.86]  That
[2929.86 --> 2931.02]  Expanse
[2931.02 --> 2931.18]  He
[2931.18 --> 2931.36]  Came
[2931.36 --> 2931.54]  From
[2931.54 --> 2931.82]  Heaven
[2931.82 --> 2932.10]  To
[2932.10 --> 2932.52]  Earth
[2932.52 --> 2933.04]  He
[2933.04 --> 2933.40]  Removed
[2933.40 --> 2933.68]  All
[2933.68 --> 2933.88]  The
[2933.88 --> 2934.48]  Barriers
[2934.48 --> 2935.16]  That
[2935.16 --> 2935.34]  We
[2935.34 --> 2935.82]  Have
[2935.82 --> 2936.00]  In
[2936.00 --> 2936.22]  Our
[2936.22 --> 2936.92]  Sinfulness
[2936.92 --> 2937.66]  To
[2937.66 --> 2938.22]  Embracing
[2938.22 --> 2938.44]  The
[2938.44 --> 2938.84]  Gospel
[2938.84 --> 2941.86]  So
[2941.86 --> 2942.22]  Then
[2942.22 --> 2943.90]  How
[2943.90 --> 2944.18]  Do
[2944.18 --> 2944.40]  I
[2944.40 --> 2944.72]  Know
[2944.72 --> 2945.86]  That
[2945.86 --> 2946.00]  It's
[2946.00 --> 2946.24]  Not
[2946.24 --> 2946.72]  Just
[2946.72 --> 2947.54]  Me
[2947.54 --> 2948.44]  Reasoning
[2948.44 --> 2948.76]  And
[2948.76 --> 2948.90]  Me
[2948.90 --> 2949.18]  Trying
[2949.18 --> 2949.36]  To
[2949.36 --> 2950.08]  Understand
[2950.08 --> 2951.14]  And
[2951.14 --> 2951.30]  It's
[2951.30 --> 2951.78]  Actually
[2951.78 --> 2952.06]  The
[2952.06 --> 2952.44]  Spirit
[2952.44 --> 2952.66]  Of
[2952.66 --> 2953.16]  God
[2953.16 --> 2953.88]  That
[2953.88 --> 2954.18]  Has
[2954.18 --> 2954.42]  Shown
[2954.42 --> 2954.58]  Up
[2954.58 --> 2954.66]  In
[2954.66 --> 2954.78]  My
[2954.78 --> 2955.14]  Life
[2955.14 --> 2955.42]  How
[2955.42 --> 2955.52]  Do
[2955.52 --> 2955.66]  I
[2955.66 --> 2955.86]  Know
[2955.86 --> 2956.02]  How
[2956.02 --> 2956.12]  Can
[2956.12 --> 2956.22]  I
[2956.22 --> 2956.34]  Tell
[2956.34 --> 2956.50]  The
[2956.50 --> 2956.96]  Difference
[2956.96 --> 2958.58]  Well
[2958.58 --> 2958.82]  Let's
[2958.82 --> 2959.00]  Look
[2959.00 --> 2959.12]  At
[2959.12 --> 2959.28]  What
[2959.28 --> 2959.84]  Happens
[2959.84 --> 2960.36]  And
[2960.36 --> 2960.72]  That
[2960.72 --> 2961.04]  Brings
[2961.04 --> 2961.20]  Us
[2961.20 --> 2961.34]  To
[2961.34 --> 2961.50]  The
[2961.50 --> 2961.78]  Second
[2961.78 --> 2962.38]  Question
[2962.38 --> 2963.06]  The
[2963.06 --> 2963.30]  People
[2963.30 --> 2963.78]  Ask
[2963.78 --> 2965.62]  They
[2965.62 --> 2966.22]  Say
[2966.22 --> 2967.32]  After
[2967.32 --> 2967.68]  Hearing
[2967.68 --> 2967.86]  All
[2967.86 --> 2967.98]  This
[2967.98 --> 2968.14]  They
[2968.14 --> 2968.28]  Say
[2968.28 --> 2968.66]  Brothers
[2968.66 --> 2969.02]  What
[2969.02 --> 2969.38]  Shall
[2969.38 --> 2969.58]  We
[2969.58 --> 2969.84]  Do
[2969.84 --> 2971.20]  What
[2971.20 --> 2971.48]  Shall
[2971.48 --> 2971.68]  We
[2971.68 --> 2971.98]  Do
[2971.98 --> 2972.60]  Right
[2972.60 --> 2972.88]  They've
[2972.88 --> 2973.04]  Been
[2973.04 --> 2973.44]  Listening
[2973.44 --> 2973.66]  To
[2973.66 --> 2973.98]  Peter
[2973.98 --> 2975.02]  They've
[2975.02 --> 2975.40]  Taken
[2975.40 --> 2975.58]  This
[2975.58 --> 2975.94]  All
[2975.94 --> 2976.40]  In
[2976.40 --> 2978.06]  What
[2978.06 --> 2978.46]  Is
[2978.46 --> 2978.60]  The
[2978.60 --> 2979.10]  Takeaway
[2979.10 --> 2979.44]  From
[2979.44 --> 2979.80]  For
[2979.80 --> 2980.14]  Them
[2980.14 --> 2980.26]  You
[2980.26 --> 2980.36]  Know
[2980.36 --> 2980.54]  How
[2980.54 --> 2980.66]  Do
[2980.66 --> 2980.76]  They
[2980.76 --> 2981.06]  Take
[2981.06 --> 2981.26]  This

[3053.56 --> 3053.72]  I
[3053.72 --> 3053.90]  Know
[3053.90 --> 3054.40]  I
[3054.40 --> 3054.56]  Think

[3059.06 --> 3059.24]  Need
[3059.24 --> 3059.36]  To
[3059.36 --> 3059.66]  Think
[3059.66 --> 3059.96]  About
[3059.96 --> 3061.12]  But
[3061.12 --> 3061.30]  That's
[3061.30 --> 3061.42]  Not
[3061.42 --> 3061.58]  What
[3061.58 --> 3061.90]  Happens
[3061.90 --> 3062.14]  Here
[3062.14 --> 3062.82]  Right

[3066.32 --> 3066.52]  The
[3066.52 --> 3066.98]  Heart
[3066.98 --> 3067.98]  Right
[3067.98 --> 3068.18]  Which
[3068.18 --> 3068.32]  Is
[3068.32 --> 3068.88]  Entirely
[3068.88 --> 3069.32]  Different
[3069.32 --> 3070.22]  From

[3070.72 --> 3072.00]  That
[3072.00 --> 3072.18]  Was
[3072.18 --> 3072.46]  That's
[3072.46 --> 3072.56]  A
[3072.56 --> 3072.72]  Good
[3072.72 --> 3073.08]  Point

[3075.88 --> 3076.06]  That
[3076.06 --> 3076.18]  A
[3076.18 --> 3076.32]  Bit
[3076.32 --> 3076.52]  Or
[3076.52 --> 3076.84]  Forget
[3076.84 --> 3077.10]  About
[3077.10 --> 3077.34]  It
[3077.34 --> 3078.14]  Right

[3083.04 --> 3083.20]  The
[3083.20 --> 3083.44]  Heart
[3083.44 --> 3083.68]  Means
[3083.68 --> 3083.84]  That
[3083.84 --> 3083.96]  They
[3083.96 --> 3084.10]  Were
[3084.10 --> 3084.68]  Completely
[3084.68 --> 3085.76]  Undone
[3085.76 --> 3086.56]  By

[3092.36 --> 3092.70]  By
[3092.70 --> 3093.00]  The
[3093.00 --> 3093.40]  Truth
[3093.40 --> 3093.58]  Of

[3093.72 --> 3093.90]  And

[3262.34 --> 3262.48]  He
[3262.48 --> 3262.74]  Did
[3262.74 --> 3263.02]  It
[3263.02 --> 3263.42]  Because
[3263.42 --> 3263.92]  He
[3263.92 --> 3264.20]  Loves
[3264.20 --> 3264.48]  Me
[3264.48 --> 3266.80]  And
[3266.80 --> 3266.88]  It
[3266.88 --> 3267.00]  Was

[3270.18 --> 3270.42]  From
[3270.42 --> 3270.80]  Peter
[3270.80 --> 3271.56]  Think
[3271.56 --> 3271.80]  About
[3271.80 --> 3272.20]  Peter
[3272.20 --> 3273.78]  He

[3274.06 --> 3274.90]  Fallen
[3274.90 --> 3275.46]  So
[3275.46 --> 3275.88]  Short
[3275.88 --> 3276.50]  Right
[3276.50 --> 3276.92]  He

[3284.06 --> 3284.62]  Jesus
[3284.62 --> 3285.82]  And
[3285.82 --> 3286.00]  So
[3286.00 --> 3286.28]  He
[3286.28 --> 3286.44]  Is
[3286.44 --> 3286.66]  In

[3290.52 --> 3290.70]  Is
[3290.70 --> 3291.00]  True
[3291.00 --> 3291.90]  If

[3292.24 --> 3292.54]  Was
[3292.54 --> 3292.92]  Dead
[3292.92 --> 3293.12]  And
[3293.12 --> 3293.24]  Then
