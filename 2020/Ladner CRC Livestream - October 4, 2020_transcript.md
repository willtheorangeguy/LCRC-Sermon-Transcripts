[255.98 --> 259.42]  back there are Lori, Don, and Jake, making sure everything
[259.42 --> 262.42]  sounds okay in here and streams out.
[263.48 --> 266.74]  Good to see you all here this morning. Later, Pastor Jason
[266.74 --> 271.80]  Trull will open God's Word, bringing us a message, continuing through the study of Acts.
[272.18 --> 275.84]  This time we're at Acts 8. I understand he's going to talk about
[275.84 --> 277.76]  the scattering of the early church.
[279.88 --> 283.82]  For those of you who don't have young children, or don't
[283.82 --> 288.00]  have them any longer, this is the first Sunday in which we are refiring
[288.00 --> 291.82]  the Kids Life program. Although the kids can't be in the service
[291.82 --> 295.78]  here even for a short period of time because of the numbers and know that it's happening
[295.78 --> 299.78]  in the room behind us and Hannah Yao and some of her
[299.78 --> 303.40]  able assistants are starting the whole program again
[303.40 --> 307.28]  and the parents have been apprised that they can either
[307.28 --> 311.76]  join us in the service here or at least drop their kids off if they choose
[311.76 --> 315.94]  to watch it from home. But the program has restarted
[315.94 --> 317.76]  and we're thankful for that as well.
[320.56 --> 324.00]  Our monetary offerings this morning, things don't remain as normal.
[324.00 --> 329.20]  And today the offering is for ABBA Canada. It gives financial assistance to
[329.20 --> 333.76]  Christian families adopting children locally and internationally.
[333.76 --> 340.56]  If you are in our audience, there was or is a box at the back where you can make your contribution
[340.56 --> 345.36]  on your way in this morning. If you're viewing from home, you can drop off a check.
[345.36 --> 350.94]  You can make an online contribution on our website. There are other options as well.
[350.94 --> 356.56]  Check out the Connections newsletter. Once again, thank you all for the continuing support
[356.56 --> 362.08]  that you have shown during these past months when it actually is work to make a contribution
[362.08 --> 364.56]  to the work of this church.
[366.56 --> 371.66]  Next Sunday is Thanksgiving Sunday and the offering next Sunday will be for World Renew.
[371.66 --> 375.98]  This provides aid to people around the world struggling with hunger, poverty, and illness.
[375.98 --> 382.06]  That's the short version. A much longer and helpful description was written by Marian and is in our
[382.06 --> 387.58]  Connections newsletter. And I encourage you to read that. We are up to Connections number 12.
[387.58 --> 394.62]  And that was sent by email to many of you. But if you don't have email or haven't gotten a copy,
[394.62 --> 400.30]  you can again stop by the church and Dorothy will provide a copy for you.
[400.30 --> 410.70]  Speaking of next week again, for the first time in about six months, we are going to celebrate
[410.70 --> 414.86]  the Lord's Supper again. Or communion if you're listening in and you're not familiar with some
[414.86 --> 421.02]  of our terminology. Next Sunday there will be communion here. We're going to have an unusual,
[421.90 --> 423.66]  we hope, practice.
[423.66 --> 433.42]  On your way in next Sunday, you're going to pick up one of these. This is a disposable combined
[434.70 --> 442.86]  cup of juice and a wafer. The wafer is under the first flap and the juice is under the second flap. The
[442.86 --> 449.42]  ushers will help you on the way in to pick up your own personal version of it and come on in and do it.
[449.42 --> 455.66]  But unfortunately, our current supplier cannot provide a gluten-free option. So if you are a
[455.66 --> 461.66]  person who is affected by gluten, you may have to bring another option for the bread portion of
[461.66 --> 467.66]  the communion service which will happen next Sunday. If you are wishing to participate with us at home,
[468.62 --> 473.82]  you can stop by the church during the week and pick up one of these if you'd like to use this practice.
[473.82 --> 481.74]  Or use your own source of juice and bread. Or simply join with us in spirit as we celebrate
[481.74 --> 485.42]  for the first time in quite a long time, Lord's Supper next Sunday.
[493.58 --> 498.46]  Our call to worship this morning is adapted from a text written by a woman named Catherine Hawk.
[498.46 --> 499.74]  Our call to worship this morning is adapted from a woman named Catherine Hawk.
[499.74 --> 500.38]  Listen with me.
[500.38 --> 510.22]  Come with your questions. Come with your awe. For the God who brooded over chaos during creation meets us in this place.
[512.06 --> 520.46]  Come with your energy. Come with your weariness. For the God who breathed life into dust meets us in this place.
[520.46 --> 529.58]  Come with your sadness. Come with your joy. For the God who deigned to become human meets us in this place.
[533.58 --> 540.78]  And God's greeting to you, actually more of a command this morning, comes from Psalm 46, verses 10 and 11.
[540.78 --> 548.86]  Be silent and know that I am God. I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world.
[548.86 --> 554.46]  The Lord Almighty is here among us. The God of Israel is our fortress.
[556.14 --> 564.14]  We'll begin the next phase by singing three songs of praise as the vocalists assemble here and I wander down to the trumpet stand.
[564.46 --> 568.14]  Let's get ready to praise God with several songs this morning.
[568.14 --> 571.58] control in Againstiments
[587.66 --> 589.50]  compared to the Trinity's Guinness Party interior.
[589.50 --> 605.50]  Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, that King of creation.
[607.00 --> 615.58]  Oh, my soul, praise him for his, your health and salvation.
[615.58 --> 632.10]  Come, all who hear, brothers and sisters of here, join me in blood and oration.
[635.10 --> 644.22]  Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things is wondrously reigning.
[645.58 --> 653.42]  Sheltering you up to this week, oh, so gently, so still.
[656.28 --> 664.58]  Have you not seen all that is needful as beginning?
[664.58 --> 670.08]  Stand by his wishes or dare.
[670.08 --> 671.36]  Amen.
[671.36 --> 698.20]  Praise to you, O Lord, all that is in me adore him.
[698.20 --> 708.94]  All that has life and breath come now with presence before me.
[708.94 --> 726.26]  Let me, O Lord, come from his people again, that he forever adore me.
[728.20 --> 735.20]  Let me, O Lord, come from his people again, that he forever adore me.
[735.20 --> 739.20]  Our next song is Give Thanks to God for Good and Teeth.
[739.20 --> 752.08]  His love endures forever.
[752.08 --> 755.08]  Give thanks to the Lord of Lords.
[755.08 --> 757.36]  His love endures forever.
[757.36 --> 761.26]  To him who alone does great wonders.
[761.26 --> 763.68]  His love endures forever.
[763.68 --> 767.32]  Who, by his understanding, made the heavens.
[767.32 --> 769.76]  His love endures forever.
[769.76 --> 772.98]  Who made the sun to govern the day.
[772.98 --> 775.44]  His love endures forever.
[775.44 --> 782.44]  His love endures forever.
[782.44 --> 790.44]  The song invites us to draw forth to God, to thank him for who he is and what he has done in our lives.
[790.44 --> 796.44]  He is not just the God who has done these things for people many years ago.
[796.44 --> 803.44]  So, he is the God who also does them for us today.
[803.44 --> 805.44]  His love endures forever.
[805.44 --> 818.44]  Give thanks to God for Good and Teeth.
[818.44 --> 822.44]  Thanks to God for Good and Teeth.
[822.44 --> 827.44]  His love endures forever.
[827.44 --> 833.44]  To him all praise and glory be.
[833.44 --> 838.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[838.44 --> 843.44]  His wondrous works with praise record.
[843.44 --> 850.44]  His love abides forever.
[850.44 --> 852.44]  The only God.
[852.44 --> 854.44]  The sovereign Lord.
[854.44 --> 862.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[862.44 --> 867.44]  His wisdom made the heavens to be.
[867.44 --> 872.44]  His love abides forever.
[872.44 --> 879.44]  He spread the earth upon the sea.
[879.44 --> 884.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[884.44 --> 889.44]  Praise him, O sun awakes the day.
[889.44 --> 895.44]  His love abides forever.
[895.44 --> 901.44]  The moon and stars his might display.
[901.44 --> 902.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[902.44 --> 903.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[903.44 --> 908.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[908.44 --> 909.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[909.44 --> 910.44]  Our love abides forever.
[910.44 --> 911.44]  His mercy lasts forever.
[911.44 --> 913.44]  He helps us in our deepest woes.
[913.44 --> 925.44]  His love abides forever.
[925.44 --> 928.44]  His love abides forever.
[928.44 --> 930.44]  He helps us in our deepest woes.
[930.44 --> 932.44]  His love abides forever.
[932.44 --> 934.44]  His love abides forever.
[934.44 --> 935.44]  His love abides forever.
[935.44 --> 938.44]  He handsomed us from all our foes.
[938.44 --> 940.44]  His love abides forever.
[940.44 --> 945.96]  His mercy lasts forever.
[947.40 --> 952.64]  Each creature's need he will supply,
[952.98 --> 957.08]  His love abides forever.
[958.52 --> 964.32]  Give thanks to God in throne on high,
[964.32 --> 969.22]  His mercy lasts forever.
[970.44 --> 982.44]  In connection with our sermon today's message,
[983.00 --> 986.06]  our final praise song is the Spirit song.
[987.04 --> 989.14]  The Spirit song describes how,
[989.58 --> 992.28]  after accepting the Lord Jesus into our hearts,
[992.28 --> 996.80]  He will give us the Holy Spirit to reside within us.
[997.58 --> 998.86]  As it says in the song,
[998.86 --> 1001.18]  the Holy Spirit will fill our hearts,
[1001.60 --> 1002.86]  satisfy our souls,
[1003.32 --> 1004.34]  and make us whole.
[1005.74 --> 1008.18]  The Holy Spirit is a comforter,
[1008.82 --> 1011.76]  reminding us of the important things that we must do,
[1012.40 --> 1014.90]  and guides us to walk in truth.
[1016.14 --> 1019.28]  The Holy Spirit is an intercessor for us with God,
[1019.88 --> 1022.96]  helps plead our concerns with our Heavenly Father,
[1022.96 --> 1025.36]  and also helps us to pray.
[1026.72 --> 1031.06]  The Holy Spirit refreshes us daily with hope and love.
[1032.44 --> 1034.64]  The song asks our Lord Jesus,
[1035.32 --> 1037.68]  come, fill your lambs.
[1038.64 --> 1042.30]  Yes, Lord Jesus, come, fill your lambs.
[1042.30 --> 1056.08]  O let the Son of God unfold you,
[1056.08 --> 1059.76]  with His Spirit come, fill your hands,
[1059.76 --> 1060.62]  and fill your hands.
[1060.62 --> 1062.18]  O let the Son of God unfold you,
[1062.18 --> 1075.10]  with His Spirit and His love.
[1075.10 --> 1082.44]  Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.
[1082.44 --> 1089.78]  O let Him have those things that hold you,
[1089.78 --> 1094.82]  and His Spirit like a love,
[1094.82 --> 1102.82]  will descend upon your life and make you whole.
[1102.82 --> 1112.98]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1112.98 --> 1123.38]  Jesus, come and fill your hands.
[1123.38 --> 1130.96]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1130.96 --> 1133.02]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1133.02 --> 1138.54]  come and fill your hands.
[1140.96 --> 1147.40]  O come and sing this song with gladness,
[1147.40 --> 1152.16]  as your hearts are filled with joy.
[1152.16 --> 1160.72]  Lift your hands and sweet surrender to His name.
[1160.96 --> 1166.96]  O give Him all your tears and sadness.
[1166.96 --> 1170.96]  Give Him all your years of pain.
[1170.96 --> 1179.96]  And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.
[1179.96 --> 1189.96]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1189.96 --> 1194.96]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1194.96 --> 1200.96]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1200.96 --> 1207.96]  Jesus, O Jesus,
[1207.96 --> 1209.96]  Jesus,
[1209.96 --> 1217.96]  Come and fill your hands.
[1217.96 --> 1223.96]  that you'll send Him all the sockets.
[1223.96 --> 1227.96]  sana,
[1227.96 --> 1233.32]  for a time of confession
[1233.32 --> 1241.32]  Confession and Assurance, I was reflecting in the last week. Over the last many years,
[1242.68 --> 1247.96]  in our European travels, my wife Elaine and I have been, well, we guess maybe at least 100
[1249.00 --> 1255.08]  Catholic cathedrals. In fact, during the time that we were living in Europe in the 90s with
[1255.08 --> 1261.80]  our children, and she was homeschooling the children's, the field trips tended to be associated
[1261.80 --> 1269.08]  with the C word, one more cathedral. Not to be confused with the M word on Thursdays, museums,
[1269.64 --> 1277.48]  but we've been to many cathedrals and every time I'm in a cathedral, you eventually wander by that
[1278.52 --> 1283.72]  confession area, the confession box. They're usually very ornate, carved wood and that sort of thing,
[1284.84 --> 1291.24]  and you wonder what goes on in those confession booths. Well, confession of course, but
[1291.80 --> 1299.00]  how much do you tell that priest? What is that priest designed to, able to, or willing to put up
[1299.00 --> 1304.20]  with in terms of the detail of what you went through during the past week and what confession you were
[1304.20 --> 1309.48]  willing to make to him? I've always wondered about that. I'm not intending to become a Catholic
[1309.48 --> 1315.80]  Christian anytime soon, but you wander out of that church saying, I wonder how I did the last week.
[1315.80 --> 1323.24]  What would I tell the priest? Well, I was pretty good last week.
[1325.56 --> 1334.20]  I don't hate anybody. I'm sure I didn't kill anybody. There are a few people I don't like very much.
[1334.20 --> 1342.84]  I was a bit short with my wife a couple of times during the course of the week, but I apologized a little bit,
[1343.72 --> 1346.60]  eventually. And doesn't everybody do that?
[1349.48 --> 1355.40]  When I got cut off in traffic a couple days ago, I was definitely upset, but later I was okay.
[1355.40 --> 1358.68]  I was like, okay. That's sort of like being forgiving, isn't it?
[1361.88 --> 1365.96]  I feel bad for those who are out of work, and I felt that way during the past week, because,
[1365.96 --> 1369.56]  especially because of this virus, who are struggling, those who are struggling financially,
[1371.32 --> 1380.12]  I'm doing okay. And I helped some of those a bit in some ways. But you know, the many years of my hard
[1380.12 --> 1385.24]  work and my good financial planning are the main reason I'm doing okay.
[1388.04 --> 1393.00]  I hope you see a pattern here, and I hope you think that I might be exaggerating a little bit.
[1394.44 --> 1400.20]  But the Apostle Paul understood this very well, and he taught us in Romans 3. And I want to begin reading
[1401.48 --> 1402.28]  at verse 20.
[1402.28 --> 1410.44]  1. No one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law. Rather, through the law,
[1410.44 --> 1418.52]  we become conscious of our sin. But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known.
[1419.16 --> 1424.52]  This righteousness of God is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
[1424.52 --> 1433.32]  2. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile. My updated translation would be between me and
[1433.32 --> 1434.04]  anyone else.
[1434.04 --> 1442.76]  3. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by His grace
[1442.76 --> 1449.64]  through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement
[1449.64 --> 1455.88]  through the shedding of His blood to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate His righteousness
[1455.88 --> 1462.76]  because in His forbearance, the Oxford English Dictionary calls that patience, self-control,
[1462.76 --> 1471.40]  restraint, and tolerance. Because of His forbearance, He had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[1471.40 --> 1477.32]  He did it to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who
[1477.32 --> 1485.24]  justifies those who have faith in Jesus. Well, that's God's plan for me, and I think for all of you.
[1489.24 --> 1492.20]  Sometimes we see our actions through rose-colored glasses, and I think
[1493.16 --> 1497.32]  Paul has been quite instructive to us, and for that we say, thanks be to God.
[1498.60 --> 1502.52]  Let's sing our song of response, I know not why, God's wondrous grace.
[1507.32 --> 1528.32]  For us singing, that God has � keyboarded or closed auditories, and for us singing, to me man has phrases as kind of a glorious
[1528.32 --> 1539.34]  I know not why God's wondrous grace to me has been known,
[1539.34 --> 1551.14]  nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for His own.
[1551.14 --> 1563.42]  But I know my happy living and then persuaded that He is evil,
[1564.08 --> 1575.26]  to keep the land which I committed unto Him I did that day.
[1575.26 --> 1587.26]  I know not how this saving faith to me He did impart,
[1588.48 --> 1598.26]  nor how believing in His Word brought peace within my heart.
[1598.26 --> 1610.26]  But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is evil,
[1611.78 --> 1622.26]  to keep the land which I committed unto Him I did that day.
[1622.26 --> 1635.26]  I know not what a good or a good may perish for me.
[1636.26 --> 1647.26]  All weary ways are golden days before His face I see.
[1647.26 --> 1660.26]  But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able,
[1660.26 --> 1672.26]  to keep the land which I committed unto Him I did that day.
[1672.26 --> 1696.16]  Good morning.
[1696.16 --> 1699.74]  It is great to see you all this morning.
[1701.18 --> 1707.08]  And as was mentioned today, we are continuing on in our sermon series in the book of Acts,
[1707.48 --> 1709.32]  entitled The Church and Movement.
[1709.84 --> 1715.84]  Sometimes we think of a church, as John mentioned earlier, as a cathedral, as a building, as
[1715.84 --> 1716.66]  an institution.
[1717.52 --> 1722.14]  But actually what we're seeing in the book of Acts is the church is not that, the church
[1722.14 --> 1723.16]  is the people of God.
[1723.16 --> 1729.72]  And the book of Acts in particular tells a story of what the Holy Spirit, the Spirit
[1729.72 --> 1736.44]  of Jesus Christ himself, does in and through this people of God, in the earliest disciples
[1736.44 --> 1737.30]  that we read about.
[1738.16 --> 1745.26]  So we're going to look today at Acts chapter 8, and this is a turning point in the story
[1745.26 --> 1745.70]  so far.
[1745.76 --> 1752.70]  So far up through chapters 1 through 7, the believers have been in the city of Jerusalem.
[1753.16 --> 1759.32]  But today here, starting in Acts chapter 8, we're going to see the gospel go forth, go
[1759.32 --> 1762.04]  out of Jerusalem and spread beyond.
[1762.56 --> 1764.76]  And so let's read the passage for today.
[1764.86 --> 1770.92]  We'll be reading chapter 8, verses 1 to 8, and then a couple of verses, 14 to 17.
[1771.84 --> 1773.64]  So here is God's word.
[1773.64 --> 1780.92]  And Saul approved of their killing him, that is, Stephen, who we read about last time.
[1781.92 --> 1788.14]  On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except
[1788.14 --> 1792.30]  the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
[1793.26 --> 1797.84]  Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
[1797.84 --> 1802.48]  But Saul began to destroy the church.
[1803.28 --> 1809.30]  Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.
[1810.14 --> 1813.90]  Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
[1814.68 --> 1818.74]  Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there.
[1818.74 --> 1826.22]  When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention
[1826.22 --> 1827.54]  to what he said.
[1828.34 --> 1833.98]  For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame
[1833.98 --> 1834.52]  were healed.
[1835.00 --> 1837.80]  So there was great joy in that city.
[1839.38 --> 1841.36]  Now skipping ahead to verse 14.
[1841.36 --> 1847.02]  When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter
[1847.02 --> 1848.24]  and John to Samaria.
[1848.86 --> 1853.34]  When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there, that they might receive the
[1853.34 --> 1857.20]  Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them.
[1858.12 --> 1861.24]  They had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1862.80 --> 1867.56]  Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
[1868.52 --> 1869.90]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1869.90 --> 1871.78]  Thanks be to God.
[1872.14 --> 1873.04]  Let's pray together.
[1876.88 --> 1884.24]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for this written word, the word that was spoken in the beginning
[1884.24 --> 1890.70]  and has been given to your people through the prophets, and now, Lord, has been recorded
[1890.70 --> 1891.38]  for us.
[1892.14 --> 1893.30]  And it is still alive.
[1893.38 --> 1894.24]  It is still active.
[1894.64 --> 1898.98]  We pray that this morning, as your word goes forth, that it would not return empty what
[1898.98 --> 1901.92]  would accomplish the purpose for which it was sent.
[1902.94 --> 1909.82]  And Lord, may it come into each of our hearts, to me, to all those who hear.
[1910.66 --> 1915.28]  And Lord, we pray that it would be your spirit who speaks, and we, your disciples, who listen.
[1915.48 --> 1916.54]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1916.80 --> 1917.06]  Amen.
[1917.06 --> 1917.14]  Amen.
[1918.74 --> 1924.94]  So I want to start off this morning with the prompting of my wife, Christy, with a little
[1924.94 --> 1925.58]  physics.
[1926.14 --> 1930.18]  It's not something I normally do, and I'm a little bit nervous with John and Bart here,
[1930.28 --> 1933.16]  who will later pull me aside and say that wasn't quite accurate.
[1934.02 --> 1938.46]  But does everyone remember Newton's first law of motion?
[1938.46 --> 1941.76]  So, yes, good.
[1942.38 --> 1943.40]  I had to Google it.
[1944.24 --> 1949.12]  The first law of motion, right, states that an object, in layman's terms here, okay, an
[1949.12 --> 1955.26]  object will stay at rest, or will kind of continue along the path that it is going, unless compelled
[1955.26 --> 1959.20]  to change a state by the action of an outside force.
[1961.26 --> 1962.98]  Okay, so now why am I talking about this?
[1962.98 --> 1968.32]  It's because when we look at the book of Acts and the history of the church, what we
[1968.32 --> 1975.22]  see is that God's people will kind of be at rest, or will just be doing the ministry that
[1975.22 --> 1981.96]  we're doing, kind of going in one direction, just going along with inertia, until God compels
[1981.96 --> 1985.88]  the church to get moving in a whole new way.
[1986.84 --> 1992.64]  And a modern example of this is what happens in China during the Communist Revolution in 1949,
[1992.98 --> 2001.12]  there were about 600, well, exactly, 637 Western missionaries from the China Inland Mission
[2001.12 --> 2005.14]  in China, and during the Revolution, they were all kicked out.
[2005.20 --> 2006.40]  They were expelled from China.
[2007.04 --> 2010.76]  And to all observers, this was a total disaster.
[2012.26 --> 2014.24]  But where did all the missionaries go?
[2014.74 --> 2016.94]  Well, they went to Japan.
[2017.10 --> 2017.84]  They went to Taiwan.
[2017.96 --> 2019.12]  They went to Southeast Asia.
[2020.64 --> 2022.30]  What happened in China?
[2022.98 --> 2025.12]  Well, the church grew like crazy.
[2025.80 --> 2032.00]  And today, there are 30 or 40 times as many missionaries as there was when the missionaries
[2032.00 --> 2032.40]  left.
[2032.72 --> 2034.74]  Without Western missionaries, can you imagine?
[2036.70 --> 2042.82]  In the book of Acts, in the history of the church, even up to today, is the story of God
[2042.82 --> 2050.58]  compelling his church through the Spirit to bring the gospel to new places and new people
[2050.58 --> 2056.16]  to kind of get us up from our comfort, get us moving, and get us bringing the gospel into
[2056.16 --> 2057.18]  new directions.
[2058.46 --> 2060.52]  Because God is on mission.
[2061.36 --> 2065.42]  God is on mission to redeem and to restore this entire world.
[2065.42 --> 2069.94]  And I think sometimes, as the church, we can get comfortable where we are.
[2071.18 --> 2071.36]  Right?
[2071.48 --> 2073.16]  Like these Christians in Jerusalem.
[2073.36 --> 2074.70]  You know, things were going so well.
[2074.82 --> 2076.90]  People were being added to the church.
[2076.98 --> 2078.46]  It was becoming a mega church.
[2078.94 --> 2081.24]  They had their problems, but they were sorting them out.
[2081.24 --> 2087.94]  And when this happens, we often see that God compels us to move outside of our comfort
[2087.94 --> 2094.34]  zones and cross barriers with the gospel in ways that are often uncomfortable for us.
[2095.26 --> 2097.90]  And friends, that is what's happening in our passage this morning.
[2098.36 --> 2102.06]  So today, I want us to look at this passage to see what it teaches us about the mission
[2102.06 --> 2107.92]  of the early church and how that mission continues to today and what our part is in it.
[2107.92 --> 2111.88]  And so there are two kind of big things I want us to look at today.
[2112.04 --> 2114.04]  First, the spreading of the gospel.
[2114.32 --> 2114.68]  Excuse me.
[2115.04 --> 2115.90]  Spreading of the gospel.
[2116.36 --> 2120.62]  And then secondly, the sending of the spirit, which we see there in verses 14 to 17.
[2121.50 --> 2123.76]  So first, let's look at the spreading of the gospel.
[2124.48 --> 2129.24]  And I want us to notice three things here about how the gospel spreads.
[2130.58 --> 2134.64]  First, I want us to look at how the gospel is spread.
[2134.88 --> 2135.04]  Okay?
[2135.06 --> 2136.18]  How the gospel is spread.
[2136.18 --> 2143.56]  So if you look at the first three verses, we can see here that the early church in Acts
[2143.56 --> 2147.92]  finds itself suddenly facing an outbreak of persecution.
[2148.52 --> 2154.62]  And so last week, we looked at chapter 7 and Stephen, who had just become the first Christian
[2154.62 --> 2156.06]  martyr, right?
[2156.12 --> 2161.74]  So for his faith in Jesus, he was stoned to death in broad daylight.
[2161.74 --> 2167.24]  And when that happened, all the Christians knew suddenly that the stakes had been raised.
[2167.88 --> 2168.00]  Right?
[2168.04 --> 2169.30]  That to be a Christian, right?
[2169.30 --> 2176.82]  To be a part of this community of the church suddenly meant that your life was in danger.
[2177.92 --> 2179.16]  So look at verse 1.
[2179.16 --> 2186.56]  It says, on that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem.
[2187.14 --> 2190.94]  And all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
[2192.08 --> 2194.38]  And so you'll notice, where does this persecution begin?
[2195.44 --> 2196.36]  In Jerusalem.
[2197.32 --> 2201.18]  And then Luke explicitly writes that everyone was scattered where?
[2202.54 --> 2203.94]  Judea and where?
[2204.80 --> 2205.36]  Samaria.
[2205.36 --> 2208.48]  Does that remind you of anything?
[2209.54 --> 2210.36]  Well, it must.
[2210.50 --> 2216.10]  Because if we go back to Acts chapter 1, before Jesus departed, he ascended into heaven and
[2216.10 --> 2218.76]  gave his disciples the mission he was going to send them on.
[2218.84 --> 2227.78]  He said, you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends
[2227.78 --> 2228.32]  of the earth.
[2228.96 --> 2233.68]  See, notice Jesus is saying that this movement was never meant to stay in Jerusalem.
[2233.68 --> 2236.98]  And it wasn't a movement for the Jews only.
[2237.10 --> 2240.56]  But there is neither, Paul writes, slave or free.
[2240.72 --> 2243.20]  There's neither Jew nor Greek, but all are one in Christ.
[2244.50 --> 2247.60]  And so do you see what Luke is trying to show us here?
[2248.70 --> 2256.06]  He's trying to get across and saying that everything is going exactly according to God's purposes
[2256.06 --> 2260.10]  and the plans of the risen Christ.
[2260.10 --> 2261.18]  Right?
[2261.26 --> 2267.28]  He's saying that in the midst of the chaos that this early church must have been feeling,
[2267.36 --> 2268.46]  they are being persecuted.
[2268.90 --> 2270.10]  Their brother was killed.
[2271.28 --> 2272.14]  This is terrible.
[2272.88 --> 2278.12]  In the midst of that fear, that uncertainty, that anxiety that is happening, that is all
[2278.12 --> 2283.94]  that they can see, everything is playing out perfectly according to the plan of Jesus
[2283.94 --> 2286.30]  Christ who reigns Lord of Lords.
[2286.30 --> 2294.40]  Even this persecution somehow mysteriously works out according to God's plans.
[2295.26 --> 2302.92]  And the message is that there is a hope and a redemption that cannot be stopped because
[2302.92 --> 2304.62]  God is the one doing it.
[2306.06 --> 2310.58]  And so we see here that through this attack upon the church, what happens?
[2311.04 --> 2313.14]  The church is scattered.
[2313.14 --> 2313.62]  Right?
[2314.04 --> 2319.90]  God uses the enemy's attacks upon the church not to destroy the church, but he uses it
[2319.90 --> 2325.30]  to bring a greater expansion of the gospel beyond Jerusalem just as he had promised.
[2327.30 --> 2331.60]  And it's always under persecution that the church actually tends to grow.
[2331.70 --> 2334.02]  And I think it's really important that we understand that.
[2334.02 --> 2340.44]  It's also important just as a way of application for us to realize that, you know, when things
[2340.44 --> 2347.74]  go badly in life, when there's chaos and there's suffering, we don't understand what's happening.
[2348.40 --> 2351.48]  Here, we see that God knows exactly what is happening.
[2352.06 --> 2353.12]  And he has a plan.
[2353.98 --> 2355.08]  And so we can trust in that.
[2355.66 --> 2358.64]  So secondly, though, let's look at who is spreading the gospel.
[2358.86 --> 2359.58]  First, how?
[2359.76 --> 2361.12]  It was scattered through this persecution.
[2361.60 --> 2363.44]  Now, who is the one that's going to go spread it?
[2363.44 --> 2366.28]  And if we go back to verse 1 here, it says,
[2366.78 --> 2370.14]  On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem.
[2371.18 --> 2372.18]  And then notice this.
[2372.94 --> 2378.24]  All except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
[2378.80 --> 2382.68]  So the apostles, for whatever reason, were restricted to staying in Jerusalem.
[2382.96 --> 2383.68]  They couldn't leave.
[2384.18 --> 2386.78]  But everyone else, it says, was scattered.
[2387.72 --> 2390.80]  So the apostles remained and everyone else was scattered.
[2390.80 --> 2393.82]  But then if you look at it in verse 4, what does it say?
[2394.64 --> 2400.20]  It says, those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
[2401.30 --> 2401.48]  Right?
[2401.54 --> 2403.74]  All those who were scattered went out preaching the word.
[2404.64 --> 2408.12]  And so the apostles, they were the appointed leaders of the church.
[2408.58 --> 2410.90]  But they were the ones who couldn't leave the city.
[2410.96 --> 2411.66]  We don't know why.
[2412.02 --> 2413.92]  But it says they couldn't leave the city.
[2414.30 --> 2417.08]  The leaders of the church, but everyone else went out.
[2417.08 --> 2423.60]  And so what that means is that everyday Christians, not the apostles, but all of us,
[2424.36 --> 2429.66]  it was the merchants and the farmers and the tradesmen and craftsmen,
[2430.00 --> 2436.30]  when they left Jerusalem, everywhere they went, they went out preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2436.54 --> 2439.16]  They couldn't help but speaking about this Jesus.
[2439.16 --> 2443.64]  And what I love about this is that these men and women are leaving Jerusalem,
[2443.98 --> 2448.78]  not because of some courageous sense that they are on mission that God has given them.
[2448.94 --> 2449.20]  No.
[2449.84 --> 2451.14]  What are they doing?
[2451.96 --> 2453.66]  They're fleeing for their lives.
[2454.16 --> 2455.36]  They're running away.
[2457.28 --> 2463.92]  They're just ordinary people driven by ordinary motivations that I think that you and I can relate,
[2464.42 --> 2465.62]  can identify with.
[2465.62 --> 2470.18]  But no matter where they went, they took the gospel with them.
[2470.74 --> 2474.64]  You know, they said, God has brought me to this place now.
[2474.76 --> 2476.86]  Here I am among these people.
[2477.10 --> 2481.80]  So how can I reach these people that God has placed me among?
[2481.92 --> 2484.86]  This was the question that was always driving them.
[2484.92 --> 2486.04]  They're always thinking about.
[2486.80 --> 2490.14]  So every single person, when they were scattered because of persecution,
[2490.44 --> 2493.40]  they took the fire of the gospel with them wherever they went.
[2493.40 --> 2497.44]  And I use that word fire because I want to read you this quote from a commentator.
[2498.22 --> 2499.06]  He says this,
[2499.06 --> 2504.12]  The hand of the enemy scattered the fire of the early church.
[2504.84 --> 2508.06]  But instead of extinguishing it,
[2509.02 --> 2514.48]  each hot ember became where it fell the center of another fire.
[2515.18 --> 2517.44]  And thus many a district were set,
[2517.62 --> 2519.68]  excuse me,
[2519.96 --> 2525.56]  many a district were set ablaze with the hope of the gospel.
[2526.92 --> 2527.16]  Right?
[2527.16 --> 2528.22]  Can you picture that?
[2529.04 --> 2529.58]  The fire,
[2529.66 --> 2532.38]  these hot embers getting scattered abroad.
[2532.38 --> 2536.46]  And each time they become the center of a new flame of the gospel,
[2536.86 --> 2537.76]  spread out.
[2538.96 --> 2542.72]  And there's something interesting about this word that Luke uses for scattered.
[2542.94 --> 2546.12]  There's actually two words in Greek that could be used for scattered.
[2546.24 --> 2547.98]  And the one that he chooses here
[2547.98 --> 2551.92]  is the word with the root of a seed.
[2551.92 --> 2558.88]  So I think it's really interesting because they were scattered like one scatters seeds.
[2560.10 --> 2562.48]  And what happens to scattered seeds?
[2564.14 --> 2567.16]  They're planted and they grow.
[2567.98 --> 2568.10]  Right?
[2568.60 --> 2569.14]  And friends,
[2569.26 --> 2572.02]  every day we are,
[2572.20 --> 2572.34]  you know,
[2572.52 --> 2572.68]  well,
[2572.74 --> 2573.20]  for one,
[2573.26 --> 2575.06]  from the perspective of Acts,
[2575.22 --> 2576.32]  Acts in Jerusalem,
[2576.32 --> 2580.06]  this gospel has scattered all the way to Delta,
[2580.60 --> 2580.86]  BC.
[2581.54 --> 2581.78]  Right?
[2581.94 --> 2582.82]  2,000 years later.
[2582.96 --> 2586.34]  The word has been scattered abroad all over the world.
[2587.16 --> 2588.52]  And it has come to us.
[2589.06 --> 2591.02]  But also each one of us here,
[2591.46 --> 2592.28]  we are scattered.
[2592.40 --> 2593.98]  We go out into our cities,
[2594.56 --> 2595.88]  into Latin or into Delta,
[2596.10 --> 2596.58]  into Richmond.
[2596.84 --> 2597.60]  We're scattered.
[2597.70 --> 2598.58]  We're scattered abroad.
[2598.58 --> 2604.20]  And so have you ever considered yourself a seed that God has scattered?
[2606.02 --> 2613.44]  And that you have been planted and placed to grow and bear gospel fruit wherever God has sent you?
[2613.50 --> 2616.94]  Because God is the one who is moving his church by his spirit.
[2617.00 --> 2618.02]  And he's doing that then.
[2618.10 --> 2619.54]  He's doing it today with us.
[2620.48 --> 2622.20]  And so this is what these early Christians did.
[2623.12 --> 2623.32]  Okay?
[2623.40 --> 2628.10]  So we see how the gospel is scattered abroad through this persecution.
[2628.58 --> 2630.90]  Which is the way it's often been in the church.
[2631.40 --> 2632.46]  And we see who does it.
[2632.66 --> 2634.94]  They go out and they spread the gospel.
[2635.12 --> 2636.40]  They tell about Jesus.
[2636.80 --> 2637.58]  Wherever they go.
[2638.02 --> 2642.54]  And then the third thing we see here is who the gospel is preached to.
[2643.34 --> 2644.78]  So if you look at verse 5,
[2644.86 --> 2645.20]  it says,
[2645.20 --> 2651.46]  Philip then went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there.
[2651.46 --> 2659.50]  So we need to stop here and talk about the significance of reaching Samaria with the gospel.
[2660.62 --> 2664.20]  And so do you remember in John chapter 4,
[2665.34 --> 2668.80]  Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well.
[2669.32 --> 2673.26]  And she's basically asking the fundamental question that all of us are asking,
[2673.38 --> 2674.90]  which is where can I find God?
[2674.90 --> 2677.48]  And Jesus begins to talk to her.
[2677.52 --> 2677.98]  And he says,
[2678.30 --> 2680.16]  If you knew who was asking you for a drink,
[2680.98 --> 2685.24]  you would ask him and he would give you water where you would never thirst again.
[2685.98 --> 2687.12]  And the woman asks,
[2687.44 --> 2688.82]  Well, where can I get this water?
[2689.82 --> 2692.64]  You know, not knowing that he's talking about spiritual life.
[2693.32 --> 2697.28]  And then Jesus goes on to unveil to her that in fact that he is the Messiah.
[2697.28 --> 2704.60]  And that God is looking for true worshipers who will worship God in spirit and in truth.
[2705.26 --> 2710.26]  And Jesus says it's not going to be confined to any specific place anymore.
[2711.12 --> 2717.54]  But God is doing a new thing through the Messiah, through him, through Jesus.
[2718.58 --> 2722.64]  So now, Philip comes to Samaria.
[2722.64 --> 2733.94]  And you have to keep in mind the hostility that existed between Jews and Samaritans that has been there for a thousand years.
[2734.58 --> 2737.60]  And it actually began with the reign of King Solomon.
[2737.72 --> 2740.88]  Right after the reign of King Solomon, the breaking up of the kingdom, the monarchy,
[2741.26 --> 2748.38]  where ten of the northern tribes defected and they made Samaria their capital.
[2748.38 --> 2754.64]  So then we have the two southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
[2754.92 --> 2757.14]  And then there's the northern Israel.
[2757.98 --> 2760.42]  And then things became steadily worse after that.
[2760.54 --> 2765.58]  When Samaria was then captured by Assyria in 722 BC.
[2766.28 --> 2771.38]  And thousands of the Samaritans, and usually it was kind of the upper class,
[2772.22 --> 2777.40]  even the artisans, the workers, the tradesmen, they were all exiled.
[2777.40 --> 2779.44]  They were taken out of Israel.
[2780.28 --> 2784.54]  And what happened is the Assyrians sent their people to move into the area.
[2785.02 --> 2785.78]  And then what happened?
[2786.46 --> 2787.62]  They intermarried.
[2788.52 --> 2792.90]  So now what you have is these Samaritans who were despised by the Jews
[2792.90 --> 2795.52]  because they were viewed as a mixed race,
[2795.54 --> 2798.70]  because they had intermarried with these Assyrian Gentiles.
[2799.46 --> 2802.90]  But they were also despised, not only because of that,
[2803.70 --> 2806.42]  but because of their religion as well.
[2806.42 --> 2812.78]  The Samaritans, you know, because the prophets are always talked about how God would restore Jerusalem.
[2813.00 --> 2815.62]  So they ignored the prophets and they just focused on the Torah.
[2816.28 --> 2820.32]  And then not only that, they had built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim.
[2820.86 --> 2822.54]  They didn't even worship in Jerusalem.
[2823.16 --> 2826.70]  So the Jews thought these people were just off their rails.
[2826.70 --> 2832.38]  And this is one of the things the woman at the well says to Jesus,
[2832.60 --> 2834.52]  you know, talking about where the temple is.
[2834.66 --> 2835.04]  She said,
[2835.16 --> 2838.42]  Our fathers say that it is here where we are to worship,
[2838.84 --> 2840.80]  and your fathers say it is in Jerusalem.
[2842.64 --> 2844.32]  And this is when Jesus says,
[2844.86 --> 2847.28]  A time is coming, and now has come,
[2847.34 --> 2850.98]  when you will worship God neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
[2850.98 --> 2854.30]  Jerusalem, true worship will happen in spirit and in truth.
[2855.86 --> 2860.34]  And so these people were considered about as unclean as you can get.
[2861.18 --> 2862.26]  So when Jesus says,
[2863.14 --> 2864.90]  You will preach the gospel in Samaria,
[2865.78 --> 2867.78]  and in chapter 1, verse 8,
[2868.48 --> 2870.90]  there would have been a natural reflex among the Jews
[2870.90 --> 2872.50]  to just like plug their ears
[2872.50 --> 2874.20]  and pretend they didn't hear that.
[2874.72 --> 2876.98]  Like, Jesus, I don't know what you just said there,
[2876.98 --> 2879.12]  but whatever, you know, we're just going to move on.
[2880.56 --> 2882.82]  But here you have the gospel going forth
[2882.82 --> 2885.18]  and showing once again that God's purpose
[2885.18 --> 2887.06]  was always beyond Israel.
[2887.72 --> 2889.58]  God didn't choose a people
[2889.58 --> 2891.60]  and then reject the rest of the world.
[2891.68 --> 2894.44]  And that's how Israel understood their own election.
[2894.92 --> 2897.22]  But God told Israel that his desire
[2897.22 --> 2899.26]  is that they would be a light to the nations.
[2900.08 --> 2901.16]  And God's plan was,
[2901.28 --> 2903.84]  I chose you so that you,
[2903.84 --> 2904.92]  that through you,
[2905.30 --> 2906.60]  I would bless everybody.
[2907.74 --> 2909.16]  And then I love what it says in verse 8.
[2909.92 --> 2911.36]  When the gospel comes to Samaria,
[2911.50 --> 2912.00]  what does it say?
[2912.08 --> 2912.62]  What happens?
[2913.28 --> 2915.44]  It says there was a great joy in that city.
[2916.92 --> 2920.58]  The gospel being preached in the Samaritans,
[2920.70 --> 2922.38]  receiving it with great joy.
[2922.90 --> 2924.90]  And I think that's such a beautiful thing,
[2924.94 --> 2927.04]  and it's such a powerful motivation for us
[2927.04 --> 2928.46]  to take the gospel
[2928.46 --> 2930.94]  and share it with other people who haven't heard it
[2930.94 --> 2933.30]  because we know the gospel brings joy
[2933.30 --> 2935.00]  in people's lives
[2935.00 --> 2935.82]  as it's been brought,
[2935.92 --> 2937.76]  as it's come into our lives.
[2939.58 --> 2941.46]  So this is the first thing we see here
[2941.46 --> 2942.36]  in Acts chapter 8,
[2943.14 --> 2944.80]  that through the persecution of the church,
[2944.88 --> 2945.86]  the church is scattered,
[2946.54 --> 2948.46]  and the scattering doesn't cause them
[2948.46 --> 2950.20]  to lose their faith,
[2950.60 --> 2951.22]  but rather,
[2951.68 --> 2953.80]  they share their faith as they go out,
[2954.44 --> 2955.60]  crossing barriers,
[2956.00 --> 2958.36]  taking the gospel to the Samaritans.
[2958.36 --> 2961.68]  Okay, and so that brings us to
[2961.68 --> 2963.34]  the second thing I want us to look at
[2963.34 --> 2964.08]  from this passage,
[2964.44 --> 2966.12]  which is the sending of the Spirit.
[2966.98 --> 2968.42]  And here we're turning our attention
[2968.42 --> 2970.46]  to verses 14 to 17,
[2970.58 --> 2971.64]  and I'd like to read it again.
[2971.78 --> 2972.24]  Can you actually,
[2973.32 --> 2974.50]  Laura, you put it back up for us.
[2974.60 --> 2974.88]  Thanks.
[2975.84 --> 2977.26]  So here it is in verse 14.
[2977.68 --> 2978.54]  Oh, go back one more.
[2980.00 --> 2982.28]  Okay, when the apostles in Jerusalem heard,
[2983.22 --> 2983.78]  right, okay,
[2983.86 --> 2984.52]  apostles in Jerusalem,
[2984.62 --> 2985.26]  remember they're there,
[2985.26 --> 2986.72]  they heard that Samaria
[2986.72 --> 2988.60]  had accepted the word of God.
[2989.26 --> 2989.84]  What do they do?
[2990.40 --> 2991.92]  They sent Peter and John,
[2992.20 --> 2993.58]  apostles, to Samaria,
[2994.10 --> 2995.22]  and when they arrived,
[2995.32 --> 2997.08]  they prayed for the new believers there
[2997.08 --> 2999.08]  that they might receive the Holy Spirit
[2999.08 --> 3000.44]  because the Holy Spirit
[3000.44 --> 3002.08]  had not yet come on any of them.
[3002.44 --> 3003.58]  They had simply been baptized
[3003.58 --> 3004.86]  in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[3006.74 --> 3009.04]  Then Peter and John placed their hands on them
[3009.04 --> 3010.46]  and they received the Holy Spirit.
[3011.28 --> 3012.70]  Okay, thanks.
[3012.70 --> 3017.30]  So here we see this strange delay
[3017.30 --> 3019.80]  between the time when the Samaritans
[3019.80 --> 3021.62]  believed in the gospel
[3021.62 --> 3022.46]  and they were baptized
[3022.46 --> 3026.28]  and then them receiving the Holy Spirit.
[3027.00 --> 3028.08]  So let's talk about that.
[3028.76 --> 3029.86]  And I think it's important for us
[3029.86 --> 3031.94]  to understand what is going on here
[3031.94 --> 3034.40]  because these verses have been the source
[3034.40 --> 3036.14]  of a lot of disagreement
[3036.14 --> 3037.46]  in the life of the church
[3037.46 --> 3038.76]  over the last,
[3038.94 --> 3041.12]  well, almost 100 years now.
[3041.12 --> 3043.72]  And this particular passage
[3043.72 --> 3045.28]  has been used by some Christians
[3045.28 --> 3048.14]  to speak to a kind of two-fold conversion.
[3048.64 --> 3050.12]  So the idea is that, you know,
[3050.14 --> 3051.68]  we are all saved at one level,
[3052.24 --> 3055.48]  but there's actually a higher level to get to
[3055.48 --> 3057.28]  and that is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[3057.90 --> 3059.90]  And so it creates this fundamental problem
[3059.90 --> 3060.96]  among the church
[3060.96 --> 3062.78]  where they would be,
[3062.88 --> 3063.52]  among Christians,
[3063.68 --> 3065.62]  the haves and the have-nots.
[3066.00 --> 3067.30]  Like some people would say,
[3067.46 --> 3069.10]  oh, you haven't received the baptism
[3069.10 --> 3070.24]  of the Spirit.
[3071.02 --> 3071.90]  And so it creates something
[3071.90 --> 3073.34]  that is extremely problematic
[3073.34 --> 3075.52]  because the baptism of the Spirit
[3075.52 --> 3077.54]  is seen as a separate baptism.
[3078.90 --> 3079.68]  And so here's the,
[3079.98 --> 3082.12]  first we need to understand this about Acts.
[3082.66 --> 3085.22]  Acts is not a doctrinal letter, right?
[3085.24 --> 3086.40]  It's not like Paul's letters
[3086.40 --> 3087.60]  where he's telling them,
[3087.68 --> 3088.62]  he's teaching them,
[3089.12 --> 3091.06]  but rather Acts is a history.
[3091.80 --> 3093.10]  And so if we pick out a passage
[3093.10 --> 3096.34]  from this whole history
[3096.34 --> 3097.24]  that is being told
[3097.24 --> 3099.34]  and use it to create a doctrine
[3099.34 --> 3100.80]  where we say this is normative
[3100.80 --> 3102.90]  for all Christians in all times,
[3102.90 --> 3104.78]  we can end up with big problems.
[3105.66 --> 3107.54]  And so Luke isn't giving us doctrine,
[3107.78 --> 3109.82]  he is telling us what he sees.
[3110.02 --> 3111.44]  He's being a faithful witness.
[3112.48 --> 3114.14]  And the reality is,
[3114.26 --> 3116.52]  what he records and what he sees
[3116.52 --> 3118.32]  is that there is a delay.
[3119.52 --> 3121.02]  So here's how I think
[3121.02 --> 3122.12]  we can understand this.
[3122.98 --> 3124.10]  So I want us to notice
[3124.10 --> 3126.08]  that there are only a few times
[3126.08 --> 3127.10]  in the book of Acts
[3127.10 --> 3128.70]  when the Holy Spirit
[3128.70 --> 3130.28]  comes upon a people
[3130.28 --> 3132.24]  in a unique way.
[3133.54 --> 3135.14]  So the first time
[3135.14 --> 3137.02]  is at Pentecost
[3137.02 --> 3139.54]  in Acts chapter 2
[3139.54 --> 3141.28]  when the Spirit comes down
[3141.28 --> 3142.50]  upon the Jews
[3142.50 --> 3143.38]  for the first time.
[3143.48 --> 3145.06]  And there's the flames
[3145.06 --> 3146.66]  and there's the wind
[3146.66 --> 3148.18]  and the Holy Spirit
[3148.18 --> 3149.98]  is obviously manifest
[3149.98 --> 3151.04]  and comes upon them.
[3152.04 --> 3153.42]  The second time
[3153.42 --> 3156.38]  is here in Acts chapter 8
[3156.38 --> 3157.80]  when the Spirit comes
[3157.80 --> 3159.66]  upon the Samaritans.
[3160.10 --> 3161.48]  The third time
[3161.48 --> 3162.58]  we see the Spirit
[3162.58 --> 3163.86]  come in a unique way
[3163.86 --> 3165.64]  is in Acts chapter 10
[3165.64 --> 3167.12]  when the Spirit comes
[3167.12 --> 3168.18]  to Cornelius
[3168.18 --> 3169.36]  and the Gentiles.
[3170.02 --> 3170.56]  So now,
[3171.02 --> 3172.72]  what's the common thread
[3172.72 --> 3173.76]  in all these passages?
[3175.02 --> 3176.56]  It's the gift of the Holy Spirit
[3176.56 --> 3178.28]  is given in an intentional way
[3178.28 --> 3179.46]  every time the Gospel
[3179.46 --> 3180.86]  crosses a racial divide.
[3181.62 --> 3182.84]  Every time the Gospel
[3182.84 --> 3184.42]  breaks into a group
[3184.42 --> 3185.86]  that might otherwise
[3185.86 --> 3187.90]  be despised
[3187.90 --> 3189.14]  or looked down on.
[3189.50 --> 3190.62]  Every time that happens
[3190.62 --> 3191.84]  in the book of Acts
[3191.84 --> 3193.38]  we see the giving
[3193.38 --> 3194.30]  of the Holy Spirit
[3194.30 --> 3195.42]  in this unique
[3195.42 --> 3197.22]  and obvious way.
[3197.86 --> 3198.60]  And it's as if
[3198.60 --> 3200.02]  the Spirit of God,
[3200.08 --> 3200.62]  the Holy Spirit
[3200.62 --> 3201.04]  is saying,
[3201.46 --> 3203.46]  I want to be totally clear
[3203.46 --> 3205.12]  that Samaritans
[3205.12 --> 3206.06]  who you Jews
[3206.06 --> 3207.28]  see as impure,
[3207.98 --> 3210.14]  they have full standing
[3210.14 --> 3211.20]  as children of God.
[3212.16 --> 3213.50]  The Gentiles
[3213.50 --> 3214.98]  who have been thought
[3214.98 --> 3216.12]  as unclean
[3216.12 --> 3218.20]  when they come to Jesus,
[3218.36 --> 3220.48]  they have the Spirit
[3220.48 --> 3221.42]  of God as well.
[3222.40 --> 3223.26]  Because remember
[3223.26 --> 3224.02]  what Paul says
[3224.02 --> 3225.88]  in 1 Corinthians 12, 13,
[3226.24 --> 3227.50]  for we were all baptized
[3227.50 --> 3228.70]  by one Spirit
[3228.70 --> 3230.70]  so as to form one body,
[3231.24 --> 3232.62]  whether Jew or Greek,
[3232.62 --> 3233.48]  slave or free,
[3233.58 --> 3234.56]  and we were all given
[3234.56 --> 3236.56]  the one Spirit to drink.
[3238.14 --> 3239.48]  So you see the emphasis
[3239.48 --> 3241.18]  on receiving the Holy Spirit
[3241.18 --> 3241.86]  in the book of Acts
[3241.86 --> 3243.06]  is always about
[3243.06 --> 3245.04]  the unity of the church.
[3245.88 --> 3246.84]  It's the Spirit
[3246.84 --> 3248.28]  that comes
[3248.28 --> 3249.96]  and just melts away
[3249.96 --> 3251.08]  all barriers
[3251.08 --> 3252.66]  and all divisions.
[3254.06 --> 3254.96]  The church
[3254.96 --> 3256.42]  is this new humanity.
[3256.60 --> 3257.26]  It's not defined
[3257.26 --> 3258.98]  by any ethnic group
[3258.98 --> 3259.74]  or race.
[3259.74 --> 3261.96]  It is the new people of God
[3261.96 --> 3263.84]  from every nation,
[3264.04 --> 3265.12]  every tongue and tribe.
[3265.20 --> 3266.08]  They're all united
[3266.08 --> 3267.30]  by this one Spirit
[3267.30 --> 3268.94]  because of this one Savior,
[3269.06 --> 3269.66]  Jesus Christ.
[3271.82 --> 3273.68]  So just to conclude
[3273.68 --> 3274.76]  this morning,
[3275.08 --> 3276.40]  what does this mean for us?
[3276.50 --> 3277.16]  And I just want to say
[3277.16 --> 3277.80]  two things.
[3278.94 --> 3280.28]  First is actually
[3280.28 --> 3282.28]  an encouragement.
[3282.28 --> 3284.72]  I want to encourage you
[3284.72 --> 3285.72]  and say that
[3285.72 --> 3287.20]  I love the heart
[3287.20 --> 3288.62]  that this church
[3288.62 --> 3291.00]  has to share the gospel
[3291.00 --> 3293.10]  beyond racial barriers.
[3293.98 --> 3294.24]  Right?
[3294.34 --> 3295.72]  We're supporting refugees.
[3296.46 --> 3297.74]  We're reaching out now
[3297.74 --> 3299.10]  to the Chinese people
[3299.10 --> 3300.36]  who are in Delta
[3300.36 --> 3302.04]  and who haven't heard the gospel.
[3303.20 --> 3304.50]  And I think
[3304.50 --> 3305.94]  we can praise God for that.
[3306.04 --> 3306.76]  That God is doing
[3306.76 --> 3308.26]  a new thing among us.
[3309.12 --> 3310.28]  And we can be thankful
[3310.28 --> 3310.78]  for that.
[3311.38 --> 3312.96]  And let's continue
[3312.96 --> 3314.24]  to follow Jesus
[3314.24 --> 3314.98]  in this way.
[3315.36 --> 3316.14]  Seeing that this church
[3316.14 --> 3317.22]  is not just for us
[3317.22 --> 3318.88]  who have been here
[3318.88 --> 3319.68]  for so long,
[3319.78 --> 3320.42]  but it's for
[3320.42 --> 3321.86]  new generations of people.
[3321.98 --> 3322.88]  It's for new people
[3322.88 --> 3324.56]  who are coming here
[3324.56 --> 3325.42]  to Ladner
[3325.42 --> 3326.06]  and to Delta.
[3326.78 --> 3328.00]  And in fact,
[3328.04 --> 3328.80]  it is challenging.
[3329.30 --> 3329.76]  In fact,
[3329.80 --> 3331.24]  it is uncomfortable.
[3331.86 --> 3332.72]  And we do need
[3332.72 --> 3333.50]  the Spirit's help.
[3334.60 --> 3336.92]  But I do want to encourage you
[3336.92 --> 3339.02]  that you are doing this.
[3339.46 --> 3340.00]  And I think
[3340.00 --> 3340.90]  it is a beautiful thing.
[3341.72 --> 3342.18]  Secondly,
[3342.32 --> 3342.94]  what this means
[3342.94 --> 3343.44]  is that
[3343.44 --> 3345.02]  every single Christian,
[3345.22 --> 3346.04]  all of us,
[3346.32 --> 3346.82]  no matter
[3346.82 --> 3348.66]  how, you know,
[3348.70 --> 3349.50]  kind of ordinary
[3349.50 --> 3350.40]  you feel
[3350.40 --> 3352.42]  today
[3352.42 --> 3353.94]  or any time,
[3354.24 --> 3354.68]  no matter
[3354.68 --> 3355.48]  how anxious
[3355.48 --> 3356.30]  you might feel
[3356.30 --> 3356.90]  or no matter
[3356.90 --> 3358.06]  how small
[3358.06 --> 3359.44]  your faith
[3359.44 --> 3361.98]  might feel to you,
[3362.24 --> 3363.36]  if you are
[3363.36 --> 3364.40]  a Christian today,
[3364.40 --> 3365.64]  you have
[3365.64 --> 3366.38]  the fullness
[3366.38 --> 3367.68]  of the presence
[3367.68 --> 3368.30]  and the power
[3368.30 --> 3369.16]  of the Holy Spirit,
[3369.36 --> 3370.42]  not just with you,
[3371.16 --> 3372.64]  but within you.
[3373.68 --> 3374.44]  It means
[3374.44 --> 3375.02]  that you are
[3375.02 --> 3375.80]  filled with
[3375.80 --> 3376.42]  the Holy Spirit.
[3378.26 --> 3378.74]  I know we're
[3378.74 --> 3379.36]  reform types,
[3379.48 --> 3379.86]  but can I get
[3379.86 --> 3380.26]  an amen?
[3381.32 --> 3381.88]  Amen.
[3384.12 --> 3385.08]  You have
[3385.08 --> 3385.86]  the very
[3385.86 --> 3386.52]  Spirit
[3386.52 --> 3387.72]  of God
[3387.72 --> 3388.82]  in you
[3388.82 --> 3389.34]  the moment
[3389.34 --> 3389.84]  you place
[3389.84 --> 3390.20]  your faith
[3390.20 --> 3391.00]  in Jesus Christ.
[3391.50 --> 3392.22]  So no matter
[3392.22 --> 3392.94]  where God
[3392.94 --> 3393.56]  sends you,
[3393.96 --> 3394.36]  no matter
[3394.36 --> 3394.92]  where you
[3394.92 --> 3395.50]  are planted,
[3395.76 --> 3396.60]  whether it's
[3396.60 --> 3397.34]  in your family
[3397.34 --> 3398.18]  or whether
[3398.18 --> 3399.36]  in your workplace
[3399.36 --> 3400.80]  or any community
[3400.80 --> 3401.74]  that you have,
[3402.60 --> 3403.14]  the Spirit
[3403.14 --> 3404.10]  is given you
[3404.10 --> 3404.98]  for your joy
[3404.98 --> 3405.70]  and salvation,
[3406.20 --> 3407.00]  but also
[3407.00 --> 3408.36]  that you would
[3408.36 --> 3409.36]  join in God's
[3409.36 --> 3409.72]  mission
[3409.72 --> 3411.74]  and share
[3411.74 --> 3412.36]  that joy
[3412.36 --> 3412.94]  and share
[3412.94 --> 3413.64]  that life
[3413.64 --> 3415.40]  with the people
[3415.40 --> 3416.34]  among whom
[3416.34 --> 3417.60]  you have been
[3417.60 --> 3418.04]  planted
[3418.04 --> 3418.94]  and scattered
[3418.94 --> 3419.68]  by the Spirit
[3419.68 --> 3420.08]  of God.
[3420.08 --> 3421.08]  So let's
[3421.08 --> 3421.62]  continue to be
[3421.62 --> 3422.08]  a church
[3422.08 --> 3423.18]  on movement
[3423.18 --> 3425.52]  and let me
[3425.52 --> 3426.12]  pray for us.
[3429.04 --> 3429.90]  Holy Spirit,
[3430.08 --> 3430.78]  we thank you
[3430.78 --> 3432.40]  that you are
[3432.40 --> 3433.44]  a God
[3433.44 --> 3434.30]  who is active,
[3435.36 --> 3435.88]  that you are
[3435.88 --> 3436.20]  a God
[3436.20 --> 3437.04]  who crosses
[3437.04 --> 3437.74]  barriers
[3437.74 --> 3438.66]  intentionally
[3438.66 --> 3440.20]  showing us
[3440.20 --> 3441.64]  that because
[3441.64 --> 3442.64]  of your Spirit,
[3443.68 --> 3444.54]  any person,
[3444.68 --> 3445.34]  wherever they are,
[3445.40 --> 3446.06]  can be a child
[3446.06 --> 3446.54]  of God.
[3446.54 --> 3446.58]  God.
[3446.90 --> 3447.40]  And that means
[3447.40 --> 3447.88]  us
[3447.88 --> 3449.94]  who are so
[3449.94 --> 3450.74]  far away
[3450.74 --> 3451.44]  from the promises
[3451.44 --> 3452.12]  of Israel,
[3452.40 --> 3453.54]  but the gospel
[3453.54 --> 3454.70]  through Christ
[3454.70 --> 3455.28]  has brought us
[3455.28 --> 3456.00]  close that we
[3456.00 --> 3457.10]  might know God.
[3458.12 --> 3458.60]  So Lord,
[3458.70 --> 3459.42]  we thank you
[3459.42 --> 3459.76]  for that.
[3459.82 --> 3459.94]  Lord,
[3459.98 --> 3460.60]  as a church,
[3460.68 --> 3461.36]  we want to be
[3461.36 --> 3462.96]  a church
[3462.96 --> 3464.20]  for the nations.
[3464.42 --> 3465.12]  We want your
[3465.12 --> 3465.64]  gospel
[3465.64 --> 3466.74]  to be heard
[3466.74 --> 3467.50]  by all kinds
[3467.50 --> 3467.96]  of people.
[3469.20 --> 3469.72]  And so Lord,
[3469.80 --> 3470.38]  we continue
[3470.38 --> 3470.90]  to ask that you
[3470.90 --> 3471.34]  would make us
[3471.34 --> 3472.34]  a light to the nations,
[3473.10 --> 3474.50]  that in this place
[3474.50 --> 3475.08]  that you have
[3475.08 --> 3476.38]  scattered us
[3476.38 --> 3477.30]  and planted us
[3477.30 --> 3477.96]  here in Ladner,
[3478.42 --> 3479.62]  that your gospel
[3479.62 --> 3480.62]  would go forth
[3480.62 --> 3481.42]  from this place
[3481.42 --> 3482.66]  through us
[3482.66 --> 3484.14]  and that your name
[3484.14 --> 3484.82]  would be glorified.
[3485.26 --> 3486.50]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3487.20 --> 3487.44]  Amen.
[3488.36 --> 3489.28]  So I invite us
[3489.28 --> 3489.96]  to stand
[3489.96 --> 3491.10]  and we will
[3491.10 --> 3492.20]  sing our song
[3492.20 --> 3492.66]  of response.
[3493.16 --> 3493.66]  Please rise.
[3493.66 --> 3493.78]  Thank you.
[3504.50 --> 3508.50]  Lord.
[3516.62 --> 3517.80]  Amen.
[3518.04 --> 3518.20]  Amen.
[3519.04 --> 3519.92]  Amen.
[3523.94 --> 3526.22]  I made me
[3526.22 --> 3526.84]  guide me
[3526.84 --> 3528.84]  I marked
[3528.84 --> 3530.56]  the菁
[3530.56 --> 3538.56]  For if you leave me, I cannot stay.
[3538.56 --> 3545.56]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3545.56 --> 3551.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3551.56 --> 3559.56]  I am weak and I need your strength and power.
[3559.56 --> 3567.56]  To endure with grace my weakest arm.
[3567.56 --> 3575.56]  Help me through the darkness your faith to see.
[3575.56 --> 3582.56]  Lead me, O Lord, lead me.
[3582.56 --> 3590.56]  Lead me, guide me along the way.
[3590.56 --> 3597.56]  For if you leave me, I cannot stay.
[3597.56 --> 3605.56]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3605.56 --> 3611.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3611.56 --> 3619.56]  Help me walk in the paths of righteousness.
[3619.56 --> 3627.56]  Be my pain when Satan and sin no press.
[3627.56 --> 3635.56]  I am trusting you where ever may be.
[3635.56 --> 3641.56]  Lead me, O Lord, lead me.
[3641.56 --> 3649.56]  Lead me, guide me along the way.
[3649.56 --> 3657.56]  For if you leave me, I cannot stay.
[3657.56 --> 3665.56]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3665.56 --> 3671.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3671.56 --> 3681.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3681.56 --> 3688.56]  I am blind without your light to see.
[3688.56 --> 3698.56]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3698.56 --> 3699.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3699.56 --> 3704.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3704.56 --> 3706.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3706.56 --> 3708.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3708.56 --> 3710.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3710.56 --> 3712.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3712.56 --> 3713.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3713.56 --> 3714.56]  And I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3714.56 --> 3721.56]  I am lost if you take your hand from me.
[3721.56 --> 3727.56]  And, Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3727.56 --> 3730.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3730.56 --> 3731.56]  Oh, Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3731.56 --> 3735.56]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3735.56 --> 3746.46]  Yes, you may be seated.
[3748.96 --> 3754.22]  So now please join me as we pray for our congregation, as we pray for our city.
[3755.00 --> 3756.04]  Let's pray together.
[3758.14 --> 3763.92]  Jesus Christ, you are the same yesterday and today and forever.
[3763.92 --> 3770.66]  And so when we ask the question, what is our only hope in life and in death?
[3771.34 --> 3776.50]  We can confidently say that we are not our own, but belong to you.
[3777.76 --> 3784.36]  Lord, our life is hidden with you in Christ today and forever.
[3785.74 --> 3788.04]  And so because of that, we do not have to fear.
[3788.80 --> 3792.02]  And let this truth, O Lord, sink into our hearts.
[3792.02 --> 3799.78]  Let your great love that you meet us with in your mercy day by day, morning by morning,
[3800.84 --> 3803.70]  in desiring to have a relation for us.
[3803.80 --> 3809.50]  Lord, would that love grip us and cast away fear?
[3811.20 --> 3814.60]  Help us, Spirit, for we are weak and tired.
[3814.60 --> 3817.52]  Lord, we are selfish and we are broken.
[3818.50 --> 3820.20]  And Lord, we do need you.
[3821.14 --> 3824.48]  We need you to breathe fresh life into us.
[3825.36 --> 3832.08]  We need you to come in and clear away our doubts, clear away our distresses,
[3832.88 --> 3835.22]  and to be filled with you.
[3836.16 --> 3837.96]  That your kingdom might come.
[3837.96 --> 3844.42]  And that we might have courage to cross barriers with the gospel in ways that might be uncomfortable.
[3847.06 --> 3854.86]  Father, show us as a community the ways and the steps and the paths that you have for us.
[3855.92 --> 3859.62]  Jesus, you say that we do not need to fear a little flock.
[3859.62 --> 3864.84]  That it is the Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom.
[3865.12 --> 3867.78]  And so that is what we are humbly asking for.
[3869.10 --> 3872.42]  And so God of mercy and love, we come before you now as your people.
[3873.24 --> 3875.54]  Many of us are anxious and hurting.
[3876.66 --> 3880.32]  It seems at times that our world is coming apart.
[3880.32 --> 3887.48]  But we are reminded many times in your word of your steadfast love and mercy.
[3888.42 --> 3894.88]  So help us, Lord, to have wisdom and patience and faith to navigate the trials of our time.
[3896.34 --> 3904.28]  God, our creator, we ask for an end to this pandemic that has disrupted many lives around the world.
[3905.44 --> 3907.86]  Deliver us, O Lord, from this pestilence.
[3907.86 --> 3912.46]  Father, we pray for our church, our church family.
[3913.02 --> 3916.34]  We thank you so much for the safe arrival of the Arga family.
[3917.36 --> 3921.36]  Lord, be with them as they settle into a new life in Canada.
[3922.32 --> 3925.70]  And Lord, help us to serve them well in your name.
[3927.36 --> 3932.02]  And thank you, Lord, for the Kids Life Sunday School that is starting back up.
[3932.02 --> 3934.86]  Lord, we thank you for all the volunteers and the helpers
[3934.86 --> 3938.70]  who are willing to serve even when it's hard and uncomfortable.
[3939.58 --> 3946.28]  And Lord, for giving us Hannah Yao, who is our new Children's Ministry Director.
[3946.52 --> 3953.06]  Lord, help her in the work that you have called her to as she works here among us for our children.
[3954.28 --> 3958.86]  And Lord, we ask that you would continue to be at work in the lives of those we love
[3958.86 --> 3962.28]  who are suffering and who are sick in different ways.
[3962.36 --> 3967.62]  Lord, we lift them up in our hearts to you right now, our merciful Father.
[3967.78 --> 3971.32]  Lord, you know who they are in each of us right now.
[3971.42 --> 3974.16]  Lord, we lift them up to you by name.
[3974.16 --> 3985.58]  Lord, you have placed your Spirit in each one of us.
[3986.60 --> 3988.60]  And Lord, we thank you for this precious gift.
[3989.08 --> 3991.76]  The gift of your presence with us in all times.
[3992.26 --> 3995.50]  The gift of your power that will help us to live for you,
[3996.20 --> 3998.82]  to conquer sin, to share the Gospel,
[3999.36 --> 4000.28]  Lord, to be your disciples.
[4000.28 --> 4005.98]  And Lord, we pray in the words that you have taught us to pray.
[4006.14 --> 4009.02]  And so, friends, I ask you all to stand here again with me
[4009.02 --> 4012.60]  as we end by saying the Lord's Prayer together.
[4013.74 --> 4014.48]  We pray,
[4014.64 --> 4016.18]  Our Father in heaven,
[4016.94 --> 4018.28]  hallowed be your name.
[4019.02 --> 4020.14]  Your kingdom come,
[4020.90 --> 4022.24]  your will be done,
[4022.58 --> 4024.56]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[4025.30 --> 4027.36]  Give us today our daily bread,
[4027.36 --> 4031.94]  and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[4032.46 --> 4034.48]  And lead us not into temptation,
[4035.12 --> 4036.98]  but deliver us from the evil one.
[4037.70 --> 4041.60]  For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[4042.76 --> 4043.10]  Amen.
[4045.16 --> 4048.78]  So we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4049.62 --> 4051.70]  So, friends, I invite you to hold out your hands
[4051.70 --> 4052.88]  to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4052.88 --> 4056.26]  Now the Lord bless you and keep you.
[4056.72 --> 4058.84]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you
[4058.84 --> 4059.90]  and be gracious to you.
[4060.30 --> 4062.68]  The Lord lift up his countenance upon you
[4062.68 --> 4064.56]  and give you his peace.
[4065.28 --> 4065.50]  Amen.
[4066.12 --> 4069.14]  So please remain standing if you are able and willing,
