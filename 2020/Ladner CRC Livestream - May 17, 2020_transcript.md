[1619.76 --> 1649.74]  Thank you.
[1649.74 --> 1679.72]  Thank you.
[1679.74 --> 1709.72]  Thank you.
[1709.74 --> 1739.72]  Thank you.
[1739.74 --> 1769.72]  Thank you.
[1769.74 --> 1799.72]  Thank you.
[1799.74 --> 1829.72]  So, good morning,
[1829.72 --> 1859.70]  You know, we all, you know,
[1859.70 --> 1889.68]  you're going to go for a bag, you know, you're going to go for a bag, you're going to go,
[1889.68 --> 1919.68]  one, we're doing, you're going to have a coconut, you're gonna take over約, you're gonna.
[1919.68 --> 1944.18]  I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.
[1944.18 --> 1952.16]  I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods. With singing lips my mouth will praise you.
[1953.70 --> 1958.44]  On my bed I remember you. I think of you through the watches of the night.
[1958.90 --> 1962.58]  Because you are my help I will sing in the shadow of your wings.
[1963.54 --> 1967.42]  I cling to you. Your right hand upholds me.
[1967.42 --> 1974.54]  Those who want to kill me will be destroyed. They will go down to the depths of the earth.
[1974.82 --> 1979.10]  They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
[1980.70 --> 1986.24]  But the king will rejoice in God. All who swear by God will glory in him,
[1986.78 --> 1989.74]  while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
[1990.64 --> 1994.44]  This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.
[1994.44 --> 1997.18]  So let's pray together as we begin.
[2000.12 --> 2003.06]  Heavenly Father, we come to you this morning.
[2003.90 --> 2008.68]  Lord, we come to you wherever we may be sitting, in our homes, our living rooms, our tables.
[2010.04 --> 2014.28]  And Lord, we thank you that even though there are many distractions about us,
[2014.82 --> 2018.86]  and distractions within us, that you have called us to yourself.
[2019.72 --> 2022.08]  You have called us to worship you this morning.
[2022.08 --> 2026.20]  And Lord, you are pleased with our worship.
[2027.24 --> 2029.66]  And Lord, we have strong desires.
[2030.96 --> 2034.62]  And Lord, we desire you, because you are the God who can satisfy us.
[2034.72 --> 2038.00]  So Lord, we ask that as we open up your word, that you would show us
[2038.00 --> 2040.46]  what it means to long for you this morning.
[2040.82 --> 2042.56]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2042.56 --> 2042.64]  Amen.
[2044.24 --> 2048.04]  So there is a pastor of a church in Houston, Texas.
[2049.24 --> 2055.76]  And he and his family were evacuated from their home for a little while,
[2055.90 --> 2060.10]  because in 2017, a big hurricane blew through Houston.
[2061.06 --> 2065.40]  In the front of their home that was a street was now a river.
[2065.40 --> 2073.50]  And there is one video that went viral right after the hurricane happened of this pastor.
[2074.00 --> 2080.80]  And he had gone back into his home to get some of his children's toys from the house.
[2081.46 --> 2085.16]  And in the video, he is on the first floor of the house.
[2085.40 --> 2087.50]  He is in waist-deep water.
[2087.50 --> 2091.32]  And there is an upright piano in the living room.
[2092.04 --> 2095.70]  And he just sits down at the piano, and he starts to play.
[2096.24 --> 2098.80]  And the water is right up to the piano bench,
[2098.92 --> 2103.16]  but it's not so high that the piano isn't working.
[2103.24 --> 2104.26]  It can still make music.
[2105.28 --> 2110.24]  So he is sitting in his living room, surrounded by dark, murky water.
[2111.06 --> 2114.00]  In his living room, his stuff is kind of floating there.
[2114.20 --> 2116.34]  And he is playing this beautiful song.
[2116.34 --> 2119.26]  You know, and then you read the comments on YouTube,
[2119.56 --> 2122.62]  and people were saying just how beautiful that was.
[2123.02 --> 2126.28]  Because by playing this song, you know, he's sitting there saying,
[2126.84 --> 2128.92]  you know, yeah, all of our stuff is gone.
[2129.14 --> 2130.54]  Our house is underwater.
[2131.50 --> 2134.92]  But that doesn't ultimately define us.
[2135.24 --> 2137.10]  You know, there's something bigger.
[2138.68 --> 2142.04]  And David here is doing just that.
[2142.40 --> 2143.80]  Only very much more.
[2144.30 --> 2145.42]  You know, David is in trouble.
[2145.42 --> 2149.14]  He is hiding out in the desert of Judah.
[2150.24 --> 2154.54]  And I think you could say metaphorically that the floodwaters are rising.
[2155.58 --> 2161.44]  But he's still singing because his soul is satisfied in God.
[2162.82 --> 2168.04]  And so today, in this psalm, David teaches us this song to express
[2168.04 --> 2171.84]  and to fulfill our longings and our desires.
[2171.84 --> 2175.44]  And we're going to look at three things this morning from this psalm.
[2176.06 --> 2178.02]  The context of our longings,
[2178.20 --> 2180.10]  the cultivation of our longings,
[2180.26 --> 2182.04]  and the covenant of our longings.
[2182.70 --> 2186.08]  And so first, the context of our longings.
[2186.16 --> 2189.98]  And sometimes, the context of our longings is the desert.
[2189.98 --> 2194.82]  So the psalm begins at the very top there.
[2195.08 --> 2199.14]  A psalm of David when he was in the desert of Judah.
[2200.10 --> 2204.14]  You know, and sometimes we see those superscriptions at the top of the psalms,
[2204.20 --> 2206.12]  and it's easy for us to just read right by them.
[2206.80 --> 2210.68]  You know, sometimes they might tell us the author or give us a musical notation.
[2210.68 --> 2218.12]  But Psalm 63 is one of 14 psalms that give us some historical orientation to David's life.
[2218.90 --> 2221.56]  And here we learn that he is in the desert of Judah.
[2222.56 --> 2227.84]  And we know from 2 Timothy 16 that he was not on vacation.
[2228.40 --> 2230.40]  He wasn't in the desert enjoying himself.
[2230.52 --> 2231.58]  He was on the run.
[2232.62 --> 2236.74]  And so this is a time in his life when David was already the king,
[2237.14 --> 2240.46]  but his son Absalom had turned on him.
[2240.68 --> 2243.86]  And was trying to overthrow the kingdom.
[2244.34 --> 2246.78]  Kick David off the throne and become king.
[2248.52 --> 2254.22]  You know, David himself, you know, Absalom was certainly sinning against David,
[2254.32 --> 2260.50]  but David had sinned against his son with his own failures as a father.
[2261.40 --> 2265.76]  You know, David never got a coffee mug on Father's Day that said,
[2265.96 --> 2267.06]  world's best dad.
[2267.20 --> 2268.36]  That never happened.
[2268.36 --> 2272.26]  You know, and he has some big failures as a father.
[2272.58 --> 2278.42]  And some of these have come home to roost through his son Absalom and Absalom's rebellion
[2278.42 --> 2281.30]  that he had roused against him.
[2282.42 --> 2284.46]  And so things aren't going well for David.
[2285.20 --> 2285.42]  Right?
[2285.48 --> 2288.64]  Just think about, you know, what's happening in David's life.
[2289.22 --> 2291.02]  He doesn't have the kingship anymore.
[2291.02 --> 2296.58]  He's living in the desert when he was living in the palace.
[2297.24 --> 2300.72]  His own son hates him and has run him out of town.
[2302.12 --> 2306.98]  And you would think he would say, like, okay, my life is over.
[2307.16 --> 2311.90]  Everything that I have worked so hard for is crashing down around me.
[2311.90 --> 2314.78]  And a lot of it is my fault.
[2316.56 --> 2322.64]  And for David, this song arose out of a context of trouble,
[2323.08 --> 2326.48]  out of a context of shame, of fear for his life,
[2326.80 --> 2330.64]  of being bereft of a home, being betrayed by a son,
[2331.12 --> 2335.58]  being a king who has been rejected by his people who he had once delivered.
[2335.58 --> 2340.36]  He is in a terrible situation.
[2341.78 --> 2346.04]  And so what does David do in this situation he finds himself?
[2346.62 --> 2348.26]  So let's look at verse 1.
[2350.08 --> 2350.76]  He writes,
[2351.54 --> 2353.30]  You, God, are my God.
[2354.18 --> 2355.50]  Earnestly I seek you.
[2355.60 --> 2356.80]  I thirst for you.
[2357.30 --> 2359.06]  My whole being longs for you
[2359.06 --> 2362.50]  in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
[2364.22 --> 2364.70]  Right?
[2364.70 --> 2366.88]  He talks about this dry and parched land.
[2367.00 --> 2368.06]  David is in the desert.
[2368.72 --> 2373.18]  You know, and the desert is a dry, arid, rocky place.
[2374.34 --> 2377.62]  And as David looks around, you know, it doesn't say this in the text,
[2377.72 --> 2383.28]  but maybe he sees some wild animals that have died of thirst there in the desert.
[2383.88 --> 2384.08]  Right?
[2384.10 --> 2386.62]  Maybe he sees these skeletons lying in the desert.
[2387.20 --> 2390.40]  And there are animals that haven't been able to get water to drink.
[2390.76 --> 2393.14]  They haven't been able to satisfy their thirst.
[2393.14 --> 2394.98]  And they've died as a result.
[2396.12 --> 2399.50]  You know, and David is in this place and he's looking around
[2399.50 --> 2404.40]  and he sees it as a picture of his own deep need for God.
[2404.94 --> 2410.68]  Where the geography of the land is reflecting the terrain of his own life.
[2411.36 --> 2414.06]  It's barren and forsaken and dry.
[2414.06 --> 2416.98]  And so he says,
[2416.98 --> 2419.76]  I thirst for you.
[2420.34 --> 2423.10]  My whole being longs for you.
[2424.28 --> 2429.04]  And in that place, what he thirsts for is God.
[2429.58 --> 2436.00]  He recognizes that what he needs and what he desires is God more than anything else.
[2436.00 --> 2439.06]  He says,
[2439.06 --> 2442.68]  You God are my God.
[2443.36 --> 2445.52]  And here, pronouns are everything.
[2446.46 --> 2447.20]  He doesn't say,
[2447.64 --> 2449.52]  God, you are the God.
[2449.92 --> 2450.76]  He doesn't say,
[2450.86 --> 2452.56]  God, you are the God of Israel.
[2453.12 --> 2453.82]  He says,
[2453.98 --> 2456.34]  You are my God.
[2456.54 --> 2458.10]  It's very personal and intimate.
[2458.10 --> 2460.24]  You know, he's saying,
[2460.38 --> 2461.34]  Even right now,
[2461.42 --> 2463.12]  when I look in front of me
[2463.12 --> 2466.34]  and all I see is hostility
[2466.34 --> 2467.60]  and my heart is broken
[2467.60 --> 2469.12]  and I'm in this desert
[2469.12 --> 2470.64]  and there's this inner desert.
[2471.62 --> 2472.96]  Despite all of that,
[2473.06 --> 2473.84]  David is saying,
[2474.66 --> 2475.70]  You are my God.
[2475.82 --> 2478.10]  You have not abandoned me.
[2478.88 --> 2480.44]  He holds on to God
[2480.44 --> 2482.44]  as that thing that is utmost
[2482.44 --> 2484.88]  in his needs and his longing
[2484.88 --> 2486.14]  and that can satisfy him.
[2486.14 --> 2490.84]  And so we see this incredible strength there that David has
[2490.84 --> 2493.24]  where he can sing in the midst of the desert
[2493.24 --> 2496.74]  where not even a coup orchestrated by his own son
[2496.74 --> 2501.52]  can destroy that identity that he has.
[2502.98 --> 2505.30]  And because God is my God,
[2505.44 --> 2506.06]  he says,
[2506.66 --> 2508.12]  Earnestly I seek you.
[2509.24 --> 2511.12]  And the word earnestly means
[2511.12 --> 2512.98]  at the dawn
[2512.98 --> 2515.46]  or in the morning
[2515.46 --> 2517.22]  and so it's like
[2517.22 --> 2519.42]  the very first thing that I do
[2519.42 --> 2520.54]  earnestly,
[2520.94 --> 2521.94]  I wake up
[2521.94 --> 2523.26]  and the first thing on my mind,
[2523.34 --> 2524.88]  the first thing I want to pursue
[2524.88 --> 2527.68]  is a relationship with God.
[2528.96 --> 2529.20]  You know,
[2529.34 --> 2531.26]  when I think about my own life
[2531.26 --> 2532.46]  and maybe it's the same for you,
[2532.54 --> 2533.48]  I wake up in the morning
[2533.48 --> 2535.52]  and so often God is like
[2535.52 --> 2537.64]  the eighth or ninth thing
[2537.64 --> 2538.74]  on the list of stuff
[2538.74 --> 2539.60]  that I want to get done.
[2540.80 --> 2541.24]  You know,
[2541.28 --> 2542.32]  we've got to get up,
[2542.36 --> 2544.04]  we have to get the kids ready for school,
[2544.04 --> 2545.12]  not so much now,
[2545.28 --> 2546.58]  my kids are in pajamas a lot,
[2547.20 --> 2548.38]  but we've got to get them up
[2548.38 --> 2550.90]  or we've got to take care of the chores at home,
[2551.12 --> 2552.38]  we've got to get to work
[2552.38 --> 2557.34]  and take care of all of the demands of our jobs.
[2558.18 --> 2559.80]  And we have all of these things
[2559.80 --> 2561.20]  that we earnestly pursue.
[2562.68 --> 2563.78]  And David is saying,
[2563.78 --> 2565.66]  those things are important,
[2565.66 --> 2568.00]  but the most important thing,
[2568.16 --> 2568.70]  earnestly,
[2569.52 --> 2570.50]  I pursue God.
[2571.80 --> 2572.84]  And for David,
[2573.14 --> 2574.56]  when God is big
[2574.56 --> 2577.32]  and when God is center in his life,
[2577.88 --> 2579.60]  all of his problems become small,
[2579.72 --> 2582.06]  even what we would think are huge problems.
[2583.32 --> 2583.90]  And likewise,
[2584.12 --> 2585.70]  when God is small,
[2586.80 --> 2588.50]  problems are big.
[2588.50 --> 2592.22]  And so he gets to his problems
[2592.22 --> 2593.62]  at the end of the psalm
[2593.62 --> 2594.86]  in verses nine to 11.
[2595.20 --> 2595.34]  You know,
[2595.36 --> 2595.60]  he says,
[2595.66 --> 2595.74]  yeah,
[2595.78 --> 2596.64]  I've got these enemies,
[2596.94 --> 2597.72]  they're lying,
[2598.28 --> 2599.62]  they're causing me trouble,
[2599.88 --> 2602.12]  but it's almost like an afterthought.
[2602.62 --> 2603.00]  He's like,
[2603.02 --> 2604.30]  God will deal with them,
[2605.24 --> 2606.76]  but seeking God first
[2606.76 --> 2609.62]  is where I find my health,
[2609.88 --> 2611.20]  is where I find my life.
[2611.20 --> 2616.02]  And David says,
[2616.24 --> 2618.54]  I thirst for you,
[2619.22 --> 2619.62]  God.
[2619.94 --> 2621.16]  I thirst for you.
[2621.54 --> 2622.32]  He doesn't say,
[2622.40 --> 2622.54]  you know,
[2622.60 --> 2623.60]  I thirst, God,
[2623.68 --> 2625.46]  for help or salvation.
[2626.08 --> 2627.28]  He doesn't say,
[2627.44 --> 2629.00]  I thirst for justice.
[2629.68 --> 2630.84]  He says,
[2631.20 --> 2632.80]  I thirst for you.
[2633.62 --> 2633.84]  Right?
[2633.92 --> 2635.72]  And he's not seeking God's gifts.
[2636.40 --> 2637.24]  God's gifts
[2637.24 --> 2639.36]  are a great blessing.
[2639.52 --> 2639.76]  God,
[2640.16 --> 2640.96]  knowing God,
[2640.96 --> 2642.26]  brings wonderful gifts
[2642.26 --> 2643.20]  into our lives,
[2643.30 --> 2644.42]  but David here is saying,
[2644.62 --> 2646.24]  I want the blesser.
[2646.42 --> 2647.46]  I want the giver.
[2648.36 --> 2648.60]  You know,
[2648.62 --> 2649.42]  we can talk about
[2649.42 --> 2650.68]  your blessings later, God.
[2650.74 --> 2652.06]  I want you.
[2652.18 --> 2653.22]  I thirst for you.
[2654.78 --> 2655.02]  Now,
[2655.04 --> 2655.66]  David is saying,
[2655.74 --> 2655.96]  God,
[2656.04 --> 2657.90]  your presence means more
[2657.90 --> 2660.44]  than getting my throne back.
[2660.96 --> 2662.42]  It means more than
[2662.42 --> 2664.44]  reconciling with my son,
[2664.44 --> 2666.48]  as great as that would be.
[2667.88 --> 2668.74]  But he says,
[2668.86 --> 2668.98]  Lord,
[2669.06 --> 2669.80]  your presence,
[2669.80 --> 2671.36]  that is what my whole being
[2671.36 --> 2672.10]  yearns for.
[2672.64 --> 2674.14]  And that if I have you,
[2674.32 --> 2674.62]  Lord,
[2675.22 --> 2677.04]  then all of these floodwaters
[2677.04 --> 2678.02]  that are around me
[2678.02 --> 2678.74]  in my life,
[2678.80 --> 2679.66]  it will be okay
[2679.66 --> 2681.18]  because I know
[2681.18 --> 2682.18]  that you are with me.
[2683.88 --> 2684.72]  And friends,
[2684.86 --> 2686.36]  we all have a desert
[2686.36 --> 2687.52]  in our lives.
[2688.08 --> 2688.26]  You know,
[2688.30 --> 2689.76]  we're all in this desert together,
[2689.88 --> 2690.48]  in this pandemic.
[2690.48 --> 2693.28]  But some of you,
[2693.40 --> 2693.74]  I know,
[2693.80 --> 2694.56]  have been through
[2694.56 --> 2696.02]  drier and wearier
[2696.02 --> 2697.10]  deserts than this.
[2698.10 --> 2699.34]  And there will be
[2699.34 --> 2700.62]  more deserts to come
[2700.62 --> 2701.96]  because that's life.
[2703.12 --> 2704.54]  And one of the things
[2704.54 --> 2705.68]  that we learn
[2705.68 --> 2708.82]  from trouble in life
[2708.82 --> 2710.52]  is that trouble
[2710.52 --> 2712.20]  is like a tube of toothpaste.
[2713.16 --> 2713.68]  So,
[2713.84 --> 2714.12]  kids,
[2714.56 --> 2716.08]  what happens
[2716.08 --> 2717.18]  when you're going
[2717.18 --> 2718.04]  to brush your teeth
[2718.04 --> 2718.92]  and you take
[2718.92 --> 2719.70]  the tube of toothpaste
[2719.70 --> 2721.44]  and you squeeze it?
[2722.42 --> 2723.14]  What happens?
[2724.18 --> 2724.58]  Well,
[2724.68 --> 2725.56]  when you squeeze it
[2725.56 --> 2726.94]  and when you put pressure on it,
[2727.14 --> 2728.60]  you see what comes out,
[2728.66 --> 2728.84]  right?
[2728.92 --> 2729.74]  You can see what color
[2729.74 --> 2730.50]  your toothpaste is
[2730.50 --> 2731.56]  and get it all over the counter.
[2733.16 --> 2733.54]  And
[2733.54 --> 2736.42]  it can be the same way for us.
[2736.94 --> 2737.94]  Have you ever been
[2737.94 --> 2738.74]  like that before
[2738.74 --> 2739.14]  where,
[2739.44 --> 2739.66]  you know,
[2739.70 --> 2740.50]  it seems like
[2740.50 --> 2741.52]  you're a good person,
[2742.10 --> 2743.50]  you're a patient person,
[2743.60 --> 2744.72]  you're a kind person,
[2744.72 --> 2746.04]  but suddenly
[2746.04 --> 2748.08]  when you find yourself
[2748.08 --> 2748.86]  under pressure
[2748.86 --> 2750.80]  and things are going wrong,
[2751.66 --> 2753.00]  suddenly you find yourself
[2753.00 --> 2754.14]  thinking or saying
[2754.14 --> 2755.10]  or doing things
[2755.10 --> 2756.08]  or treating people
[2756.08 --> 2757.50]  in a certain way
[2757.50 --> 2758.28]  when you're like,
[2758.94 --> 2759.24]  wow,
[2759.30 --> 2760.36]  was that really me?
[2760.84 --> 2761.04]  Right?
[2761.08 --> 2762.50]  Did that come out of me?
[2763.36 --> 2764.26]  And unfortunately,
[2764.52 --> 2765.60]  the answer is
[2765.60 --> 2766.74]  yes,
[2766.98 --> 2768.26]  that is you.
[2769.58 --> 2769.92]  You know,
[2769.92 --> 2771.10]  you and I are able
[2771.10 --> 2772.22]  to hide
[2772.22 --> 2773.66]  things
[2773.66 --> 2775.26]  when life is calm
[2775.26 --> 2776.20]  and life is steady
[2776.20 --> 2777.24]  and things are going well,
[2777.52 --> 2780.16]  but when pressure comes on,
[2780.36 --> 2782.46]  what is really inside of us
[2782.46 --> 2783.50]  is squeezed out.
[2784.46 --> 2785.66]  And when
[2785.66 --> 2787.84]  we are in
[2787.84 --> 2789.30]  the desert of life,
[2790.22 --> 2792.02]  our needs are exposed,
[2792.50 --> 2793.68]  you can't stay in the desert
[2793.68 --> 2794.32]  very long,
[2795.10 --> 2796.72]  your disappointments
[2796.72 --> 2797.56]  confront you,
[2797.56 --> 2798.98]  and sometimes
[2798.98 --> 2800.40]  it helps to see
[2800.40 --> 2802.60]  what you really desire
[2802.60 --> 2804.34]  and what you really long for
[2804.34 --> 2805.44]  in those situations.
[2806.70 --> 2807.22]  Sometimes
[2807.22 --> 2808.50]  we have to be
[2808.50 --> 2809.36]  in the desert
[2809.36 --> 2810.82]  if we're going to
[2810.82 --> 2811.90]  really learn
[2811.90 --> 2813.28]  how to desire
[2813.28 --> 2814.54]  and long for God.
[2815.92 --> 2816.44]  Okay,
[2816.52 --> 2817.44]  so that's the kind of
[2817.44 --> 2818.08]  the context
[2818.08 --> 2818.98]  of our longings.
[2819.36 --> 2820.64]  So now the question is,
[2820.72 --> 2821.46]  how can we
[2821.46 --> 2823.00]  cultivate this longing
[2823.00 --> 2823.54]  for God
[2823.54 --> 2824.50]  that we see here?
[2824.50 --> 2826.32]  You know,
[2826.42 --> 2827.62]  my son John
[2827.62 --> 2828.50]  is reading
[2828.50 --> 2829.38]  the story
[2829.38 --> 2831.44]  of Sir Shackleton's
[2831.44 --> 2832.56]  journey in Antarctica.
[2833.62 --> 2834.04]  And so
[2834.04 --> 2834.82]  every night
[2834.82 --> 2835.76]  when I say
[2835.76 --> 2836.46]  goodnight to him,
[2836.54 --> 2837.62]  he gives me an update
[2837.62 --> 2838.20]  on what's happening
[2838.20 --> 2838.72]  in the story.
[2838.86 --> 2839.34]  He tells me about
[2839.34 --> 2839.84]  what he's reading.
[2840.50 --> 2841.46]  And just the other night,
[2841.52 --> 2841.70]  you know,
[2841.74 --> 2842.22]  he told me,
[2842.32 --> 2842.36]  well,
[2842.40 --> 2842.86]  the ship
[2842.86 --> 2844.36]  is being crushed
[2844.36 --> 2845.18]  by the ice
[2845.18 --> 2845.66]  and the ship
[2845.66 --> 2846.34]  is sinking beneath
[2846.34 --> 2846.90]  the waters.
[2847.14 --> 2848.08]  It's going slow.
[2848.64 --> 2849.16]  And so
[2849.16 --> 2849.96]  Sir Shackleton
[2849.96 --> 2850.96]  tells his men,
[2851.72 --> 2852.20]  you can take
[2852.20 --> 2853.16]  some personal belongings
[2853.16 --> 2853.76]  off the ship.
[2853.80 --> 2854.74]  We need a travel light.
[2855.32 --> 2855.92]  You can take
[2855.92 --> 2856.92]  two pounds
[2856.92 --> 2857.98]  worth of
[2857.98 --> 2858.86]  personal belongings
[2858.86 --> 2859.32]  with them.
[2861.06 --> 2862.08]  And this psalm
[2862.08 --> 2862.88]  has served
[2862.88 --> 2863.78]  something as
[2863.78 --> 2865.44]  an essentials checklist.
[2866.62 --> 2867.24]  No journey
[2867.24 --> 2868.10]  into the desert
[2868.10 --> 2868.80]  of life
[2868.80 --> 2870.08]  should be attempted
[2870.08 --> 2870.94]  without
[2870.94 --> 2873.44]  these essential things.
[2874.64 --> 2875.42]  And so
[2875.42 --> 2876.36]  David begins
[2876.36 --> 2876.98]  with
[2876.98 --> 2878.16]  seeing.
[2878.78 --> 2879.36]  With seeing
[2879.36 --> 2880.34]  the glory of God.
[2880.90 --> 2881.68]  And we see this
[2881.68 --> 2882.38]  in verse 2.
[2883.16 --> 2884.36]  He says,
[2884.48 --> 2885.40]  I have seen you
[2885.40 --> 2886.28]  in the sanctuary
[2886.28 --> 2887.88]  and beheld
[2887.88 --> 2888.72]  your power
[2888.72 --> 2889.54]  and your glory.
[2890.30 --> 2891.52]  So the first thing
[2891.52 --> 2892.30]  that David does
[2892.30 --> 2893.62]  is he has a vision
[2893.62 --> 2894.34]  of God
[2894.34 --> 2895.48]  and he has a vision
[2895.48 --> 2896.36]  of God's glory
[2896.36 --> 2897.10]  and his power.
[2899.06 --> 2899.38]  You know,
[2899.46 --> 2900.60]  in some of us,
[2900.82 --> 2902.12]  we want to
[2902.12 --> 2904.60]  feel close
[2904.60 --> 2905.10]  to God.
[2905.62 --> 2906.88]  We want to
[2906.88 --> 2908.80]  feel near
[2908.80 --> 2909.44]  to God.
[2909.44 --> 2909.92]  God.
[2909.92 --> 2911.00]  But we can't
[2911.00 --> 2911.56]  deal with
[2911.56 --> 2912.42]  a holy
[2912.42 --> 2913.30]  and fearsome
[2913.30 --> 2914.52]  and majestic
[2914.52 --> 2915.82]  glorious God.
[2916.40 --> 2917.30]  We can't wrap
[2917.30 --> 2917.84]  our minds
[2917.84 --> 2918.52]  around it.
[2918.84 --> 2919.72]  So we
[2919.72 --> 2920.48]  think about
[2920.48 --> 2921.24]  God in more
[2921.24 --> 2922.26]  kind of personal
[2922.26 --> 2923.34]  and manageable
[2923.34 --> 2924.10]  terms.
[2924.56 --> 2925.40]  But when that
[2925.40 --> 2925.90]  happens,
[2925.90 --> 2927.18]  we don't see
[2927.18 --> 2928.40]  him in his glory
[2928.40 --> 2929.44]  and in his power.
[2930.18 --> 2930.94]  But that's not
[2930.94 --> 2931.90]  how David begins.
[2932.02 --> 2932.34]  He says,
[2932.34 --> 2933.26]  I have seen
[2933.26 --> 2934.32]  you in this
[2934.32 --> 2934.80]  sanctuary.
[2935.08 --> 2935.86]  I have beheld
[2935.86 --> 2936.74]  your glory
[2936.74 --> 2937.96]  and your power.
[2939.00 --> 2939.66]  So friends,
[2939.72 --> 2940.50]  if we want our
[2940.50 --> 2941.14]  souls to be
[2941.14 --> 2942.22]  satisfied in God,
[2942.94 --> 2943.82]  we must see
[2943.82 --> 2944.78]  God in this way.
[2945.44 --> 2945.88]  Right?
[2945.92 --> 2946.60]  We are not
[2946.60 --> 2947.10]  going to be
[2947.10 --> 2948.82]  deeply satisfied
[2948.82 --> 2949.50]  and we're not
[2949.50 --> 2949.98]  going to deeply
[2949.98 --> 2951.08]  long for something
[2951.08 --> 2951.76]  that is just
[2951.76 --> 2952.44]  kind of ordinary.
[2953.32 --> 2953.76]  Right?
[2953.78 --> 2954.16]  We're not going
[2954.16 --> 2954.68]  to be satisfied
[2954.68 --> 2955.58]  in a God
[2955.58 --> 2956.20]  that we make
[2956.20 --> 2957.20]  in our own image.
[2957.72 --> 2958.38]  We can only
[2958.38 --> 2959.16]  be satisfied
[2959.16 --> 2960.24]  in a God
[2960.24 --> 2961.46]  that is truly
[2961.46 --> 2962.26]  glorious
[2962.26 --> 2963.24]  and powerful
[2963.24 --> 2964.14]  and that is
[2964.14 --> 2964.94]  worthy of our
[2964.94 --> 2965.94]  greatest desires.
[2967.56 --> 2967.98]  And God
[2967.98 --> 2968.94]  is like that.
[2969.04 --> 2970.08]  God is glorious
[2970.08 --> 2971.68]  and David
[2971.68 --> 2972.74]  sees the glory
[2972.74 --> 2973.34]  of God
[2973.34 --> 2974.70]  and that stirs
[2974.70 --> 2975.76]  his desire.
[2976.96 --> 2977.32]  And so that's
[2977.32 --> 2977.94]  the first thing
[2977.94 --> 2978.56]  you should have
[2978.56 --> 2979.16]  on your worship
[2979.16 --> 2979.78]  checklist.
[2980.86 --> 2981.34]  And then this
[2981.34 --> 2982.32]  seeing God's glory
[2982.32 --> 2983.80]  leads next
[2983.80 --> 2984.56]  to savoring.
[2985.46 --> 2986.26]  And we see this
[2986.26 --> 2987.06]  in verse 5
[2987.06 --> 2988.02]  as David continues.
[2988.92 --> 2989.22]  He says,
[2989.36 --> 2990.00]  I will be fully
[2990.00 --> 2991.18]  satisfied as with
[2991.18 --> 2992.34]  the richest of foods.
[2992.94 --> 2993.82]  With singing lips
[2993.82 --> 2994.96]  my mouth will praise you.
[2996.38 --> 2996.88]  David,
[2996.98 --> 2997.76]  he's talking about
[2997.76 --> 2999.04]  this rich food
[2999.04 --> 3000.14]  that I think
[3000.14 --> 3000.64]  is kind of like
[3000.64 --> 3001.80]  a comfort food
[3001.80 --> 3002.72]  for the soul.
[3004.28 --> 3005.22]  So now we see
[3005.22 --> 3005.68]  that David
[3005.68 --> 3006.36]  has moved
[3006.36 --> 3006.96]  from this
[3006.96 --> 3008.02]  objective reality.
[3008.20 --> 3008.92]  He sees God
[3008.92 --> 3009.70]  for who God
[3009.70 --> 3010.56]  really is.
[3010.60 --> 3011.22]  His glory,
[3011.58 --> 3012.28]  his power.
[3013.18 --> 3013.74]  And now
[3013.74 --> 3014.96]  it becomes subjective.
[3015.72 --> 3016.80]  It's satisfying
[3016.80 --> 3017.44]  his soul.
[3017.44 --> 3019.70]  So let's think
[3019.70 --> 3020.26]  for,
[3020.46 --> 3021.10]  think about
[3021.10 --> 3022.22]  comfort food
[3022.22 --> 3022.76]  for a moment.
[3023.70 --> 3024.20]  You know,
[3024.26 --> 3024.96]  you have that
[3024.96 --> 3026.14]  go-to dish
[3026.14 --> 3027.18]  where,
[3027.34 --> 3027.50]  you know,
[3027.56 --> 3028.14]  when you're
[3028.14 --> 3029.10]  feeling homesick,
[3029.68 --> 3029.90]  you know,
[3029.96 --> 3031.12]  you desire the
[3031.12 --> 3031.88]  food from home
[3031.88 --> 3032.42]  or when you're
[3032.42 --> 3033.14]  feeling kind of
[3033.14 --> 3033.54]  down,
[3033.90 --> 3034.26]  if you would
[3034.26 --> 3035.00]  just eat this
[3035.00 --> 3035.32]  food,
[3035.40 --> 3036.30]  it would help
[3036.30 --> 3036.74]  you to,
[3036.98 --> 3037.52]  you know,
[3037.70 --> 3038.44]  make you feel
[3038.44 --> 3039.12]  a whole lot better.
[3040.40 --> 3041.42]  David is talking
[3041.42 --> 3042.00]  about feeling
[3042.00 --> 3043.48]  satisfied in this
[3043.48 --> 3043.78]  way.
[3044.78 --> 3045.10]  You know,
[3045.14 --> 3045.70]  when my family
[3045.70 --> 3046.18]  and I lived
[3046.18 --> 3046.82]  in Taiwan,
[3048.02 --> 3048.28]  you know,
[3048.36 --> 3049.50]  we love the
[3049.50 --> 3050.16]  local food,
[3050.28 --> 3050.82]  but sometimes
[3050.82 --> 3051.36]  we would just
[3051.36 --> 3052.54]  really long
[3052.54 --> 3054.04]  for our food
[3054.04 --> 3054.70]  from back home.
[3054.72 --> 3055.28]  And a lot of it
[3055.28 --> 3055.88]  we can get
[3055.88 --> 3057.10]  and make it home,
[3057.36 --> 3058.04]  but there's this
[3058.04 --> 3058.90]  one thing that
[3058.90 --> 3059.76]  we just couldn't
[3059.76 --> 3060.12]  get,
[3060.48 --> 3061.22]  and it was
[3061.22 --> 3062.22]  Italian sausage.
[3062.80 --> 3063.52]  And that may
[3063.52 --> 3063.92]  seem like a
[3063.92 --> 3064.54]  really strange
[3064.54 --> 3065.12]  thing to long
[3065.12 --> 3065.40]  for,
[3065.98 --> 3068.02]  but we didn't
[3068.02 --> 3068.58]  have it for a
[3068.58 --> 3069.00]  long time,
[3069.04 --> 3069.44]  and sometimes
[3069.44 --> 3070.06]  just be like,
[3070.52 --> 3071.32]  I would just
[3071.32 --> 3072.62]  love some
[3072.62 --> 3073.82]  Italian sausages.
[3073.82 --> 3075.94]  And,
[3076.02 --> 3076.22]  you know,
[3076.26 --> 3076.98]  it's one thing
[3076.98 --> 3077.78]  to go on
[3077.78 --> 3078.22]  Instagram,
[3078.58 --> 3079.06]  you can see
[3079.06 --> 3079.56]  a picture
[3079.56 --> 3080.38]  of this great
[3080.38 --> 3080.74]  food,
[3080.82 --> 3081.08]  and you're like,
[3081.14 --> 3081.28]  oh,
[3081.34 --> 3081.76]  that would be
[3081.76 --> 3082.50]  so delicious,
[3082.70 --> 3083.24]  you can tell
[3083.24 --> 3083.46]  it would be
[3083.46 --> 3083.92]  so good.
[3084.94 --> 3085.56]  But there's
[3085.56 --> 3086.16]  this another
[3086.16 --> 3086.82]  whole thing
[3086.82 --> 3087.32]  when you can
[3087.32 --> 3088.36]  take a bite,
[3088.66 --> 3089.20]  and you can
[3089.20 --> 3090.28]  experience it,
[3090.34 --> 3091.14]  you can savor
[3091.14 --> 3091.58]  it,
[3091.86 --> 3092.32]  and then you
[3092.32 --> 3093.34]  know how
[3093.34 --> 3094.24]  good it is.
[3095.38 --> 3095.92]  And friends,
[3096.00 --> 3096.84]  the Bible says
[3096.84 --> 3097.64]  we should taste
[3097.64 --> 3098.42]  and see that
[3098.42 --> 3098.96]  the Lord is
[3098.96 --> 3099.26]  good.
[3100.14 --> 3101.02]  It starts with
[3101.02 --> 3101.74]  knowing who
[3101.74 --> 3102.36]  God is,
[3102.46 --> 3103.14]  but then there's
[3103.14 --> 3104.14]  this way of
[3104.14 --> 3105.32]  coming and
[3105.32 --> 3106.60]  satisfying our
[3106.60 --> 3107.10]  souls.
[3107.44 --> 3108.12]  It doesn't just
[3108.12 --> 3108.66]  stay with this
[3108.66 --> 3109.10]  objective,
[3109.24 --> 3109.34]  oh,
[3109.38 --> 3109.94]  I know God
[3109.94 --> 3110.44]  is glorious
[3110.44 --> 3110.98]  and powerful,
[3111.36 --> 3112.00]  but I can
[3112.00 --> 3114.12]  experience God.
[3114.48 --> 3115.60]  I can taste
[3115.60 --> 3116.00]  it and be
[3116.00 --> 3116.56]  satisfied.
[3117.56 --> 3117.70]  You know,
[3117.72 --> 3118.10]  in food,
[3118.20 --> 3118.92]  so often the
[3118.92 --> 3119.44]  Bible is
[3119.44 --> 3120.76]  spoken of as
[3120.76 --> 3121.60]  a picture of
[3121.60 --> 3122.58]  our fellowship
[3122.58 --> 3123.24]  with God.
[3123.94 --> 3124.12]  You know,
[3124.16 --> 3124.82]  Jesus said,
[3124.94 --> 3125.42]  I am the bread
[3125.42 --> 3126.04]  of life,
[3126.40 --> 3127.00]  and to feed
[3127.00 --> 3127.60]  on him.
[3129.96 --> 3130.44]  And so we
[3130.44 --> 3131.16]  can cultivate
[3131.16 --> 3131.94]  a longing for
[3131.94 --> 3132.52]  God by,
[3132.60 --> 3132.72]  you know,
[3132.72 --> 3133.20]  seeing his
[3133.20 --> 3133.62]  power and
[3133.62 --> 3134.00]  glory,
[3134.50 --> 3134.82]  and by
[3134.82 --> 3135.76]  savoring him
[3135.76 --> 3136.34]  and enjoying
[3136.34 --> 3136.82]  him,
[3137.24 --> 3138.26]  those are the
[3138.26 --> 3138.82]  first two
[3138.82 --> 3139.32]  things we
[3139.32 --> 3140.84]  need on
[3140.84 --> 3141.40]  our journey
[3141.40 --> 3141.82]  into the
[3141.82 --> 3142.12]  desert.
[3143.40 --> 3143.86]  And then
[3143.86 --> 3144.26]  the third
[3144.26 --> 3144.58]  thing,
[3144.66 --> 3145.10]  last thing
[3145.10 --> 3145.58]  is this.
[3146.08 --> 3146.60]  In verse
[3146.60 --> 3146.92]  six,
[3147.02 --> 3147.46]  he says,
[3147.94 --> 3149.26]  here it is,
[3149.36 --> 3149.66]  he says,
[3149.74 --> 3150.54]  on my bed,
[3151.10 --> 3151.72]  I remember
[3151.72 --> 3152.00]  you.
[3152.86 --> 3153.80]  I think of
[3153.80 --> 3154.14]  you through
[3154.14 --> 3154.58]  the watches
[3154.58 --> 3155.16]  of the night.
[3156.48 --> 3157.10]  And the
[3157.10 --> 3157.68]  word here
[3157.68 --> 3158.30]  for think,
[3158.38 --> 3159.06]  I think of
[3159.06 --> 3159.44]  you in the
[3159.44 --> 3159.88]  watches of
[3159.88 --> 3160.20]  the night,
[3160.20 --> 3160.24]  night,
[3160.78 --> 3161.54]  it means
[3161.54 --> 3162.46]  to sigh,
[3163.30 --> 3163.92]  or to
[3163.92 --> 3164.70]  groan,
[3165.28 --> 3165.74]  or to
[3165.74 --> 3166.34]  mumble.
[3167.54 --> 3168.14]  And so
[3168.14 --> 3169.46]  it's like
[3169.46 --> 3170.22]  when you
[3170.22 --> 3170.84]  lose your
[3170.84 --> 3171.44]  keys,
[3172.00 --> 3172.40]  and you're
[3172.40 --> 3173.34]  searching around
[3173.34 --> 3173.78]  the house,
[3173.82 --> 3174.16]  what do you
[3174.16 --> 3174.40]  do?
[3174.98 --> 3175.86]  You're mumbling
[3175.86 --> 3176.52]  to yourself,
[3176.58 --> 3176.92]  you're like,
[3177.08 --> 3177.72]  where did I put
[3177.72 --> 3178.14]  those keys?
[3178.20 --> 3178.72]  I know I left
[3178.72 --> 3179.18]  them somewhere.
[3179.60 --> 3179.76]  You know,
[3179.80 --> 3180.42]  where did I put
[3180.42 --> 3180.58]  them?
[3180.68 --> 3180.88]  Gosh,
[3180.92 --> 3181.32]  I can't find
[3181.32 --> 3181.74]  these keys.
[3181.80 --> 3181.98]  And you're
[3181.98 --> 3182.32]  just kind of
[3182.32 --> 3182.74]  mumbling to
[3182.74 --> 3183.36]  yourself as
[3183.36 --> 3183.84]  you're searching.
[3183.84 --> 3185.24]  You know,
[3185.28 --> 3185.86]  your attention
[3185.86 --> 3186.66]  is completely
[3186.66 --> 3188.86]  focused on
[3188.86 --> 3189.58]  finding your
[3189.58 --> 3190.08]  keys.
[3191.10 --> 3191.80]  Or it's
[3191.80 --> 3192.40]  kind of like
[3192.40 --> 3193.34]  this sighing
[3193.34 --> 3195.10]  that we do
[3195.10 --> 3195.82]  when your
[3195.82 --> 3197.28]  heart is on
[3197.28 --> 3197.80]  the verge of
[3197.80 --> 3198.16]  breaking,
[3198.42 --> 3199.02]  and all you
[3199.02 --> 3199.96]  can muster
[3199.96 --> 3201.78]  is a sigh.
[3203.08 --> 3203.76]  And it's
[3203.76 --> 3204.56]  in that moment
[3204.56 --> 3206.60]  when we're
[3206.60 --> 3207.24]  faced with
[3207.24 --> 3207.88]  the temptation
[3207.88 --> 3208.92]  to just
[3208.92 --> 3209.68]  sigh,
[3209.98 --> 3210.48]  or to
[3210.48 --> 3211.34]  groan,
[3211.34 --> 3212.96]  and we're
[3212.96 --> 3214.16]  consumed by
[3214.16 --> 3214.88]  anxiety.
[3215.00 --> 3215.54]  It's all
[3215.54 --> 3216.38]  we're focusing
[3216.38 --> 3217.00]  on and
[3217.00 --> 3217.86]  thinking about.
[3218.16 --> 3218.84]  When God
[3218.84 --> 3219.70]  comes in,
[3219.74 --> 3220.34]  he tells us,
[3220.42 --> 3221.00]  no, no, no,
[3221.44 --> 3222.48]  redirect your
[3222.48 --> 3223.04]  attention.
[3223.84 --> 3223.94]  Right?
[3224.06 --> 3225.02]  Redirect it
[3225.02 --> 3226.02]  away from
[3226.02 --> 3226.74]  this thing
[3226.74 --> 3228.14]  toward me.
[3229.08 --> 3229.86]  Remember those
[3229.86 --> 3230.80]  moments when
[3230.80 --> 3231.84]  you experience
[3231.84 --> 3232.52]  my glory.
[3233.40 --> 3233.56]  Right?
[3233.68 --> 3234.28]  Meditate on
[3234.28 --> 3234.88]  my grace
[3234.88 --> 3235.20]  and my
[3235.20 --> 3235.68]  forgiveness.
[3236.30 --> 3236.80]  Redirect
[3236.80 --> 3237.62]  your attention
[3237.62 --> 3239.90]  because then
[3239.90 --> 3240.84]  you will find
[3240.84 --> 3241.32]  rest for
[3241.32 --> 3242.08]  your souls.
[3243.76 --> 3244.66]  So how do
[3244.66 --> 3245.34]  we cultivate
[3245.34 --> 3246.08]  this longing
[3246.08 --> 3246.80]  for God?
[3247.68 --> 3248.58]  It's to see
[3248.58 --> 3249.22]  God in his
[3249.22 --> 3249.68]  glory.
[3250.04 --> 3250.76]  It's to savor
[3250.76 --> 3251.48]  God's goodness.
[3251.66 --> 3252.02]  And then it's
[3252.02 --> 3253.12]  to just redirect
[3253.12 --> 3254.00]  our attention
[3254.00 --> 3255.36]  and meditate
[3255.36 --> 3256.08]  on God.
[3258.64 --> 3259.76]  So lastly,
[3260.54 --> 3261.38]  not only does
[3261.38 --> 3262.16]  this psalm talk
[3262.16 --> 3262.66]  about the
[3262.66 --> 3263.44]  context of
[3263.44 --> 3264.12]  our longings
[3264.12 --> 3265.06]  and how we
[3265.06 --> 3265.74]  can cultivate
[3265.74 --> 3266.30]  our longing
[3266.30 --> 3266.90]  for God,
[3267.68 --> 3268.46]  but he also
[3268.46 --> 3269.02]  talks about
[3269.02 --> 3269.58]  the covenant
[3269.58 --> 3270.40]  of our longing.
[3270.40 --> 3271.86]  And that is
[3271.86 --> 3272.66]  to say that
[3272.66 --> 3273.64]  we remember
[3273.64 --> 3274.70]  and rest
[3274.70 --> 3276.08]  in the covenant
[3276.08 --> 3276.84]  love that God
[3276.84 --> 3277.66]  has for us.
[3278.92 --> 3280.04]  So we see
[3280.04 --> 3280.60]  this in verse
[3280.60 --> 3280.92]  three,
[3281.66 --> 3282.44]  where David
[3282.44 --> 3282.88]  writes,
[3283.16 --> 3283.88]  because your
[3283.88 --> 3285.18]  love is better
[3285.18 --> 3285.84]  than life,
[3286.36 --> 3287.16]  my lips will
[3287.16 --> 3287.98]  glorify you.
[3289.08 --> 3290.16]  In this word
[3290.16 --> 3290.84]  love,
[3291.34 --> 3292.50]  it's this
[3292.50 --> 3293.74]  famous word
[3293.74 --> 3294.34]  hesed.
[3294.34 --> 3295.52]  it talks about
[3295.52 --> 3296.88]  the steadfast
[3296.88 --> 3297.68]  love of God,
[3297.98 --> 3298.64]  the covenant
[3298.64 --> 3299.32]  love of God,
[3299.42 --> 3300.50]  this bounded
[3300.50 --> 3301.52]  love that God
[3301.52 --> 3302.66]  has for us.
[3304.36 --> 3305.20]  God's covenant
[3305.20 --> 3306.56]  love is a
[3306.56 --> 3308.06]  reality that
[3308.06 --> 3308.90]  we can hold
[3308.90 --> 3309.32]  onto.
[3310.36 --> 3310.56]  You know,
[3310.60 --> 3311.30]  it's a truth
[3311.30 --> 3312.32]  that is given
[3312.32 --> 3312.98]  to us in the
[3312.98 --> 3313.30]  Bible.
[3313.74 --> 3314.38]  We read the
[3314.38 --> 3315.02]  scriptures and
[3315.02 --> 3316.02]  it is declared
[3316.02 --> 3317.80]  to us and
[3317.80 --> 3318.92]  shown to us
[3318.92 --> 3319.42]  that God
[3319.42 --> 3320.42]  loves us.
[3321.02 --> 3322.06]  It's a news
[3322.06 --> 3323.04]  that comes
[3323.04 --> 3323.54]  to us and
[3323.54 --> 3324.12]  that we can
[3324.12 --> 3325.04]  receive by
[3325.04 --> 3325.56]  faith.
[3326.72 --> 3327.18]  And so I
[3327.18 --> 3327.62]  knew that
[3327.62 --> 3328.38]  Roger Gross
[3328.38 --> 3329.18]  was going to
[3329.18 --> 3329.56]  be playing
[3329.56 --> 3330.32]  today and
[3330.32 --> 3331.00]  he's a
[3331.00 --> 3331.38]  superintendent
[3331.38 --> 3332.14]  of a school.
[3333.20 --> 3333.52]  And so I was
[3333.52 --> 3334.10]  thinking about
[3334.10 --> 3334.56]  all these
[3334.56 --> 3335.24]  grade 12
[3335.24 --> 3336.62]  students who
[3336.62 --> 3337.34]  have been
[3337.34 --> 3337.94]  applying to
[3337.94 --> 3339.74]  universities and
[3339.74 --> 3340.40]  they're already
[3340.40 --> 3341.12]  starting to get
[3341.12 --> 3342.04]  letters back in
[3342.04 --> 3342.44]  the mail.
[3343.56 --> 3344.32]  And hopefully
[3344.32 --> 3345.14]  one of those
[3345.14 --> 3346.06]  letters said,
[3346.92 --> 3347.56]  we approved
[3347.56 --> 3348.64]  you, right?
[3348.68 --> 3349.30]  We have
[3349.30 --> 3350.28]  accepted you.
[3350.54 --> 3350.92]  You are
[3350.92 --> 3351.82]  welcome to
[3351.82 --> 3352.58]  come here
[3352.58 --> 3353.82]  and study.
[3355.20 --> 3355.78]  And friends,
[3355.90 --> 3356.44]  this is the
[3356.44 --> 3357.46]  invitation that
[3357.46 --> 3358.28]  we've received
[3358.28 --> 3358.64]  in the
[3358.64 --> 3358.94]  scriptures.
[3359.72 --> 3360.86]  It's a letter
[3360.86 --> 3362.08]  to us written
[3362.08 --> 3362.66]  in the blood
[3362.66 --> 3363.20]  of Christ
[3363.20 --> 3365.06]  where it's
[3365.06 --> 3365.62]  this news
[3365.62 --> 3366.44]  that is
[3366.44 --> 3367.10]  announced that
[3367.10 --> 3367.64]  you have
[3367.64 --> 3368.30]  been accepted.
[3369.22 --> 3369.70]  We are
[3369.70 --> 3370.74]  able to
[3370.74 --> 3371.66]  draw near
[3371.66 --> 3372.34]  to God
[3372.34 --> 3373.20]  because he
[3373.20 --> 3373.96]  has accepted
[3373.96 --> 3374.56]  us through
[3374.56 --> 3375.42]  Jesus Christ.
[3376.98 --> 3377.42]  And so
[3377.42 --> 3377.82]  what's our
[3377.82 --> 3378.64]  response to
[3378.64 --> 3379.20]  God's covenant
[3379.20 --> 3380.18]  love for us?
[3380.88 --> 3381.56]  David writes
[3381.56 --> 3381.98]  in verse
[3381.98 --> 3383.06]  8 and he
[3383.06 --> 3383.58]  says,
[3384.18 --> 3385.02]  I cling
[3385.02 --> 3385.54]  to you.
[3386.20 --> 3386.76]  I cling
[3386.76 --> 3387.18]  to you.
[3387.60 --> 3388.14]  And it's
[3388.14 --> 3388.62]  the same
[3388.62 --> 3389.38]  language that's
[3389.38 --> 3389.84]  used for
[3389.84 --> 3390.28]  marriage.
[3391.28 --> 3391.62]  So in
[3391.62 --> 3391.90]  Genesis
[3391.90 --> 3392.66]  chapter 12
[3392.66 --> 3393.10]  it says,
[3393.32 --> 3393.72]  therefore a
[3393.72 --> 3394.78]  man will
[3394.78 --> 3395.30]  leave his
[3395.30 --> 3395.80]  father and
[3395.80 --> 3397.22]  mother and
[3397.22 --> 3398.16]  cling to
[3398.16 --> 3399.00]  his wife and
[3399.00 --> 3399.54]  the two
[3399.54 --> 3400.56]  shall become
[3400.56 --> 3401.02]  one.
[3402.72 --> 3403.20]  And so we
[3403.20 --> 3404.10]  come today
[3404.10 --> 3404.84]  in worship to
[3404.84 --> 3405.56]  remember that
[3405.56 --> 3406.42]  God loves us
[3406.42 --> 3407.06]  in this way
[3407.06 --> 3408.26]  that he
[3408.26 --> 3409.78]  calls us
[3409.78 --> 3410.70]  to himself
[3410.70 --> 3411.34]  in love
[3411.34 --> 3411.76]  than that
[3411.76 --> 3412.96]  we respond
[3412.96 --> 3414.44]  in love
[3414.44 --> 3415.18]  by clinging
[3415.18 --> 3415.86]  to God.
[3417.06 --> 3418.02]  To be a
[3418.02 --> 3418.86]  Christian means
[3418.86 --> 3419.52]  that God's
[3419.52 --> 3420.32]  love has
[3420.32 --> 3420.98]  become the
[3420.98 --> 3421.66]  anchor of
[3421.66 --> 3422.18]  your life.
[3423.26 --> 3424.46]  It holds
[3424.46 --> 3425.44]  us fast.
[3425.68 --> 3425.82]  Right?
[3425.88 --> 3426.54]  So what does
[3426.54 --> 3427.02]  an anchor
[3427.02 --> 3427.44]  do?
[3428.16 --> 3428.82]  An anchor
[3428.82 --> 3429.98]  is, you
[3429.98 --> 3430.48]  know, when
[3430.48 --> 3431.74]  we're in the
[3431.74 --> 3432.58]  storm and the
[3432.58 --> 3433.40]  wind is blowing
[3433.40 --> 3434.50]  like crazy and
[3434.50 --> 3435.68]  the tide is
[3435.68 --> 3436.44]  threatening to
[3436.44 --> 3437.54]  drag us away,
[3437.98 --> 3439.36]  the anchor is
[3439.36 --> 3440.42]  what holds you
[3440.42 --> 3441.00]  fast.
[3441.92 --> 3442.82]  And it's not
[3442.82 --> 3444.42]  our desire
[3444.42 --> 3445.14]  for God.
[3446.02 --> 3447.00]  It's not our
[3447.00 --> 3448.26]  experience of
[3448.26 --> 3448.98]  God that holds
[3448.98 --> 3449.10]  us.
[3449.12 --> 3449.68]  Those things can
[3449.68 --> 3450.18]  go up and
[3450.18 --> 3450.50]  down.
[3450.92 --> 3451.98]  But it's God's
[3451.98 --> 3453.44]  love for us
[3453.44 --> 3455.14]  in Christ that
[3455.14 --> 3456.08]  is our anchor
[3456.08 --> 3456.70]  that we can
[3456.70 --> 3457.44]  hold on to.
[3458.82 --> 3460.16]  So God loves
[3460.16 --> 3460.64]  you with a
[3460.64 --> 3461.60]  steadfast love.
[3462.42 --> 3463.36]  And when we
[3463.36 --> 3463.98]  are in the
[3463.98 --> 3464.94]  desert, when
[3464.94 --> 3465.44]  the flood
[3465.44 --> 3466.30]  waters are
[3466.30 --> 3467.94]  rising, he
[3467.94 --> 3469.40]  invites us to
[3469.40 --> 3470.42]  cling to him
[3470.42 --> 3471.68]  and to sing
[3471.68 --> 3472.82]  this song of
[3472.82 --> 3474.16]  longing and to
[3474.16 --> 3475.04]  be satisfied
[3475.04 --> 3477.22]  completely in
[3477.22 --> 3478.08]  God who can
[3478.08 --> 3478.92]  satisfy our
[3478.92 --> 3479.50]  longings.
[3479.86 --> 3480.98]  So please pray
[3480.98 --> 3481.40]  with me.
[3483.66 --> 3484.58]  Our Heavenly
[3484.58 --> 3487.02]  Father, we
[3487.02 --> 3487.96]  know that you
[3487.96 --> 3488.46]  satisfy.
[3490.08 --> 3490.78]  Would you
[3490.78 --> 3492.94]  work in us a
[3492.94 --> 3493.56]  longing for
[3493.56 --> 3493.82]  you?
[3494.52 --> 3495.26]  Because we
[3495.26 --> 3496.22]  so easily
[3496.22 --> 3497.40]  turn to
[3497.40 --> 3498.26]  other things,
[3499.12 --> 3499.80]  thinking that
[3499.80 --> 3500.30]  they might
[3500.30 --> 3501.08]  fulfill us.
[3501.76 --> 3502.64]  But Lord, you
[3502.64 --> 3503.48]  are the only one
[3503.48 --> 3503.76]  who can
[3503.76 --> 3504.20]  satisfy.
[3504.76 --> 3505.14]  Would we
[3505.14 --> 3506.30]  long for you?
[3506.70 --> 3507.12]  And in
[3507.12 --> 3508.24]  longing for you,
[3508.88 --> 3510.08]  may we know
[3510.08 --> 3510.78]  your love for
[3510.78 --> 3511.90]  us and may it
[3511.90 --> 3512.96]  be an anchor to
[3512.96 --> 3514.52]  us in all the
[3514.52 --> 3515.28]  storms of life
[3515.28 --> 3516.14]  that we face
[3516.14 --> 3516.88]  and will face.
[3517.60 --> 3518.26]  Lord, we pray
[3518.26 --> 3518.92]  for your help
[3518.92 --> 3519.56]  through your
[3519.56 --> 3520.20]  spirit in Jesus'
[3520.20 --> 3520.56]  name.
[3521.22 --> 3521.48]  Amen.
[3522.28 --> 3522.78]  So let's
[3522.78 --> 3523.10]  sing our
[3523.10 --> 3523.52]  song of
[3523.52 --> 3523.86]  response
[3523.86 --> 3524.28]  together.
[3524.28 --> 3524.78]  Amen.
[3524.78 --> 3554.76]  Thank you.
[3554.78 --> 3584.76]  Thank you.
[3584.78 --> 3586.78]  Thank you.
[3614.78 --> 3616.78]  Thank you.
[3644.78 --> 3646.78]  Thank you.
[3646.78 --> 3648.78]  Thank you.
[3648.78 --> 3650.78]  Thank you.
[3650.78 --> 3652.78]  Thank you.
[3652.78 --> 3654.78]  Thank you.
[3654.78 --> 3656.78]  Thank you.
[3656.78 --> 3658.78]  Thank you.
[3658.78 --> 3660.78]  Thank you.
[3660.78 --> 3662.78]  Thank you.
[3662.78 --> 3664.78]  Thank you.
[3664.78 --> 3666.78]  Thank you.
[3666.78 --> 3668.78]  Thank you.
[3668.78 --> 3670.78]  Thank you.
[3670.78 --> 3672.78]  Thank you.
[3672.78 --> 3674.78]  Thank you.
[3674.78 --> 3676.78]  Thank you.
[3676.78 --> 3678.78]  Thank you.
[3678.78 --> 3680.78]  Thank you.
[3680.78 --> 3685.94]  all things come from his hand. And our designated offering this week is our Deacon Help Fund.
[3686.48 --> 3692.48]  It's used to help those in our own community, our own fellowship, who have financial needs.
[3694.14 --> 3700.80]  And so, would you now please join me in a community prayer, where we bring all of our needs to our
[3700.80 --> 3710.76]  Father. Holy God, we come before you this morning as your people, and we're grateful that you know
[3710.76 --> 3718.34]  us, and you invite us to bring our concerns and our needs to you. And Lord, there are many needs.
[3719.92 --> 3727.36]  Oh Lord, the uncertainty of our time has made many of us anxious. Some are concerned about our jobs,
[3728.40 --> 3733.30]  we're concerned about our families, we're concerned about, we're concerned for our children and for
[3733.30 --> 3739.64]  what life will be like in the weeks and the months ahead. Help us, Lord, to rest in the knowledge
[3739.64 --> 3749.08]  of your kindness. Help us accept all that we sense that we have lost. And help us, Lord, to give all
[3749.08 --> 3756.78]  that up, and to be able to grow in faith during this time, sure in the knowledge that you are with us.
[3758.30 --> 3765.02]  God, our protector, we pray for safety, asking that you would spare us from the virus that has affected
[3765.02 --> 3772.22]  many and taken many lives. Help us to be diligent in looking out for one another, and give us wisdom
[3772.22 --> 3777.80]  in the coming weeks and months to learn how to live with this invisible threat.
[3779.60 --> 3786.28]  Our Father, keep us from fear as we seek to be a faithful presence of your love in our community,
[3786.46 --> 3793.72]  and show us the ways that we can serve others and bring blessing to our neighbors and to our friends
[3793.72 --> 3801.08]  in the name of Jesus. We pray, O God, for those in our community who long for healing from cancer.
[3801.88 --> 3809.30]  Lord, we lift up to you Joan and Kathy and Tim, and Lord, as Tim is struggling this week with the
[3809.30 --> 3816.92]  side effects of chemo, and as Kathy's health is declining, Lord, we ask that you would especially
[3816.92 --> 3823.68]  be with them, Lord, that in the midst of this storm, when it's so hard to hold on, that you would be
[3823.68 --> 3830.50]  their anchor. And Lord, we pray for those who care for them and care for all who are sick.
[3831.80 --> 3836.96]  And we pray for those also in our fellowship who long for healing from chronic health ailments.
[3837.92 --> 3841.62]  We pray for those among us who are shut-ins and cannot have visitors,
[3841.62 --> 3845.26]  and for those loved ones who cannot visit.
[3846.90 --> 3849.42]  Lord, we pray that you would bless business owners,
[3850.12 --> 3854.04]  Lord, who are striving to make it through these times and who long
[3854.04 --> 3857.22]  to carry on their work and to serve their community.
[3858.98 --> 3863.78]  Lord, we also lift up the many social workers who are seeking to care for people
[3863.78 --> 3866.36]  and who are overwhelmed by need.
[3867.20 --> 3871.28]  Give them strength physically and emotionally to sustain this work.
[3871.62 --> 3877.04]  Heavenly Father, we all have family members or friends who are facing difficulty.
[3878.20 --> 3883.90]  Help us to speak words of encouragement and hope to those who are sick or distraught,
[3884.62 --> 3891.56]  and we lift them up to you now, the friends and families who we know and who we care about.
[3891.56 --> 3893.12]  Lord, in the silence of our hearts.
[3893.12 --> 3913.66]  We are your people, God, and we are asking many things.
[3913.66 --> 3919.24]  But we also ask that in this time when the usual patterns of life have been interrupted,
[3920.24 --> 3922.14]  that hearts would turn toward you,
[3922.96 --> 3925.66]  and that by your spirit revival would come.
[3926.54 --> 3930.36]  Lord, bring healing and bring revival to this land.
[3930.86 --> 3933.84]  So we pray for Ladner, we pray for Delta.
[3933.84 --> 3939.68]  And keep us faithful as we wait and speak of the hope that we have in Christ Jesus,
[3940.42 --> 3941.76]  in whose name we pray.
[3942.66 --> 3942.96]  Amen.
[3942.96 --> 3951.64]  So now, friends, we leave our service with the blessing of our Father upon us.
[3951.70 --> 3955.88]  I invite you, wherever you are, to hold out your hands and to receive his blessing.
[3956.74 --> 3962.30]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the covenant steadfast love of God
[3962.30 --> 3967.54]  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all now and forever.
[3968.22 --> 3968.58]  Amen.
[3968.58 --> 3971.86]  So as we go out, we'll sing our final song together.
[3971.86 --> 3972.86]  Amen.
[3998.58 --> 4003.54]  He will sing our praise.
[4003.54 --> 4003.74]  Amen.
[4003.74 --> 4004.82]  Amen.
[4004.86 --> 4005.86]  Amen.
[4005.86 --> 4006.02]  Amen.
[4006.02 --> 4006.86]  Amen.
[4006.86 --> 4007.86]  Amen.
[4007.86 --> 4009.84]  Amen.
[4009.84 --> 4011.72]  Amen.
[4011.72 --> 4012.86]  Amen.
[4012.86 --> 4019.80]  Amen.
[4020.28 --> 4022.90]  Amen.
[4022.90 --> 4024.40]  Amen.
[4024.40 --> 4027.72]  Amen.
[4028.14 --> 4028.48]  Amen.
[4028.58 --> 4031.10]  to your love.
[4035.80 --> 4040.90]  May the grace of Christ our Savior
[4040.90 --> 4044.46]  and the Father's love
[4044.46 --> 4045.94]  bless now
[4045.94 --> 4050.10]  with the Holy Spirit's
[4050.10 --> 4053.48]  favor rest upon us
[4053.48 --> 4055.62]  all alone
[4055.62 --> 4059.18]  May me now remain
