[419.94 → 449.92] Thank you.
[449.92 → 479.90] Thank you.
[480.78 → 486.20] Before we sing our first song, I would like to share some verses from Psalm 27.
[486.20 → 516.18] This is a psalm of David.
[516.20 → 546.20] 
[546.20 → 576.20] 
[576.20 → 606.18] When my father and I will sing, when my father, I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up.
[606.18 → 636.16] My help comes from you, my help, I lift my heart, I lift my heart, I lift my heart, I lift my heart.
[636.16 → 646.30] I won't wait for you, and give my heart, I lift my heart, I lift my heart, I lift my God, I lift my heart, I lift my heart, I know, I lift my heart. Round, I lift my heart.
[646.30 → 656.36] I lift my eyes up to the mountains
[656.36 → 661.70] Where does my help come from?
[663.00 → 670.80] My help comes from you, maker of heaven
[670.80 → 676.54] Creator of the earth
[676.54 → 687.68] And then the following verses in Psalm 27 say
[687.68 → 690.80] Teach me your way, O Lord, and lead me in your path.
[692.12 → 695.02] Don't deliver me to the will of my enemies.
[696.02 → 698.38] For false witnesses have risen against me,
[698.46 → 699.98] and they breathe out cruelty.
[701.80 → 706.66] I had fainted unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
[707.96 → 709.36] Wait for the Lord.
[710.00 → 711.10] Wait for the Lord.
[711.54 → 713.56] Be strong and take courage.
[714.14 → 716.06] Yes, wait for the Lord.
[716.06 → 731.78] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[731.92 → 733.54] Wait upon the Lord.
[733.60 → 735.86] We will wait upon the Lord.
[735.86 → 739.40] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[739.54 → 741.14] Wait upon the Lord.
[741.22 → 743.18] We will wait upon the Lord.
[743.18 → 744.18] Oh God.
[744.18 → 748.62] You reign forever.
[748.62 → 751.24] Our hope.
[751.24 → 756.18] Our strong deliverer.
[756.18 → 761.18] You are the everlasting God.
[761.18 → 765.38] The everlasting God.
[765.38 → 767.66] You do not faint.
[768.00 → 771.38] You won't grow weary.
[771.38 → 772.38] You are the defender of the weak.
[772.38 → 780.20] You comfort those in need.
[780.20 → 787.06] You lift us up on wings like eagles.
[787.06 → 787.76] O God.
[787.76 → 788.06] Amen.
[788.06 → 790.36] Amen.
[790.36 → 797.88] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
[797.88 → 801.88] Wait upon the Lord, we will wait upon the Lord
[801.88 → 805.38] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
[805.38 → 809.04] Wait upon the Lord, we will wait upon the Lord
[809.04 → 814.58] O God, you reign forever
[814.58 → 819.68] Our hope, our strong delivery
[819.68 → 827.68] You are the everlasting God
[827.68 → 830.68] The everlasting God
[831.48 → 837.34] You do not faint, you won't grow weary
[837.34 → 842.82] You're the defender of the weak
[842.82 → 845.68] You comfort those in need
[845.68 → 853.68] You lift us up on wings like eagles
[853.68 → 861.68] You are the everlasting God
[861.68 → 873.60] Our prayer of confession this morning is based on Psalm 130
[873.60 → 876.26] Please pray with me
[876.26 → 884.54] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?
[885.54 → 887.96] But with you there is forgiveness
[887.96 → 891.10] Therefore you are feared
[891.10 → 893.40] I wait for the Lord
[893.40 → 898.10] My soul waits and in his word I put my hope
[898.10 → 900.78] My soul waits for the Lord
[900.78 → 903.54] More than watchmen wait for the morning
[903.54 → 906.72] More than watchmen wait for the morning
[906.72 → 910.72] Almighty God, our redeemer
[910.72 → 915.60] In our weakness we have failed to be your messengers of forgiveness and hope
[915.60 → 917.60] Renew us by your Holy Spirit
[917.60 → 918.60] Renew us by your Holy Spirit
[918.60 → 924.32] That we may follow your commands and proclaim your reign of love
[924.32 → 927.72] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord
[927.72 → 932.66] Who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit
[932.66 → 935.86] One God, now and forever
[935.86 → 937.30] Amen
[937.30 → 941.20] Hear these words of assurance
[941.20 → 944.92] The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance
[944.92 → 948.72] That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners
[948.72 → 954.86] He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
[954.86 → 960.02] So that we, free from sins, might live for righteousness
[960.02 → 964.06] By his wounds we have been healed
[964.06 → 968.10] And all God's people say, Amen
[978.72 → 989.40] Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice
[989.40 → 991.80] You became nothing
[991.80 → 995.22] Poured out to death
[995.22 → 997.80] Many times
[997.80 → 1000.94] I've wondered at your gift of life
[1000.94 → 1004.68] And I'm in that place once again
[1004.68 → 1010.14] I'm in that place once again
[1010.14 → 1013.28] Once again
[1013.28 → 1017.26] I look upon the cross where you died
[1017.26 → 1020.20] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1020.20 → 1022.74] And I'm broken inside
[1022.74 → 1024.92] Once again
[1024.92 → 1026.34] I thank you
[1026.34 → 1027.86] Once again
[1027.86 → 1031.54] I pour out my life
[1031.54 → 1037.72] Now you are
[1037.72 → 1041.04] Exalted to the highest place
[1041.04 → 1043.36] King of the heavens
[1043.36 → 1046.42] Where one day I'll bow
[1046.42 → 1048.96] But for now
[1048.96 → 1052.36] I marvel at this saving grace
[1052.36 → 1055.88] And I'm full of praise once again
[1055.88 → 1061.34] I'm full of praise once again
[1061.34 → 1064.56] Once again
[1064.56 → 1068.56] I look upon the cross where you died
[1068.56 → 1071.42] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1071.42 → 1073.98] And I'm broken inside
[1073.98 → 1076.26] Once again
[1076.26 → 1077.52] I thank you
[1077.52 → 1079.06] Once again
[1079.06 → 1082.78] I pour out my life
[1082.78 → 1085.46] ą
[1085.46 → 1086.28] Owe
[1086.28 → 1087.14] Thank you
[1087.14 → 1087.16] Thank you
[1087.16 → 1088.58] For the cross
[1088.58 → 1089.96] Thank you
[1089.96 → 1090.74] For the cross
[1090.74 → 1091.78] Thank you
[1092.62 → 1094.20] For the cross
[1094.20 → 1095.92] My friend
[1095.92 → 1098.42] Thank you
[1098.42 → 1099.68] For the cross
[1099.68 → 1101.30] Thank you
[1101.30 → 1102.12] For the cross
[1102.12 → 1104.12] Thank you
[1104.12 → 1104.96] For the cross
[1105.50 → 1108.04] My friend
[1108.04 → 1110.00] Once again
[1110.00 → 1111.36] I look upon
[1111.36 → 1120.96] the cross where you died I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside once
[1120.96 → 1128.42] again I thank you once again I pour out my life
[1141.36 → 1153.44] hello Ladder CRC family and wherever you are watching from right now I'm really grateful
[1153.44 → 1160.48] that you have gathered this morning with us, and you know as we've mentioned already today we live
[1160.48 → 1169.68] in uncertain and disorienting times but when the world feels uncertain when the world feels like
[1169.68 → 1177.52] it's upside down the best thing that we can do is to come and listen to God's word God's word
[1177.52 → 1188.00] is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path it is our firm foundation and so it is in the midst
[1188.00 → 1195.12] of this time when especially we come, and we gather, and we listen to God's eternal word together
[1195.12 → 1203.80] and so today we will continue in our sermon series in the Gospel of Mark, and we are in the church
[1203.80 → 1212.24] season of Lent it is a time when we remember Jesus's sacrifice on the cross for us so that we could
[1212.24 → 1219.90] have a relationship with God so that we might be made new again through faith in him and the gospel
[1219.90 → 1227.62] of Mark has taught us that in each and every season of our lives that Jesus is king that he still
[1227.62 → 1236.20] reigns even today he is in control of all things, and so we can trust in him, he is a good king, and he is
[1236.20 → 1241.50] a powerful king and so before we read the passage I want to say a quick note to the children
[1241.50 → 1249.94] I would love for you as I share this message I would invite you to grab a sheet of paper grab some
[1249.94 → 1256.96] pencils and crayons or markers whatever you have on hand and as we listen to the passage and as I
[1256.96 → 1263.30] preach you can draw you can draw something that you from the passage something that you hear me say
[1263.30 → 1271.08] and afterward I would love to see what you come up with so right now go ahead and grab paper pencils
[1271.08 → 1279.48] whatever you need be quick and come right back and while you do that I will read the passage for us
[1279.48 → 1292.98] okay so give your attention to God's word now the Passover and the festival of unleavened bread
[1292.98 → 1299.82] were only two days away and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest
[1299.82 → 1307.98] Jesus secretly and kill him but not during the festival they said, or the people may riot while
[1307.98 → 1313.88] he was in Bethany reclining at the table in the house of Simon the leper a woman came with an
[1313.88 → 1322.20] alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made of pure nard she broke the jar and poured the perfume on his
[1322.20 → 1328.22] head some of those present were saying indignantly to one another why this waste of perfume it could have
[1328.22 → 1336.58] been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor, and they rebuked her harshly
[1336.58 → 1343.58] leave her alone said Jesus why are you bothering her she has done a beautiful thing to me
[1343.58 → 1351.26] the poor you will always have with you, and you can help them anytime you want, but you will not always
[1351.26 → 1360.24] have me she did what she could, she poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial
[1360.24 → 1367.72] truly I tell you wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also
[1367.72 → 1376.14] be told in memory of her this is the word of the Lord thanks be to God let's pray together
[1376.14 → 1388.00] our heavenly father we have come into your presence and worship wherever we are, and we have entered into
[1388.00 → 1397.38] a holy time we have entered into a holy place as you have invited us and called us, so Lord be close to us
[1397.38 → 1407.76] open our hearts to understand your word remove the darkness that surrounds us and give us your light
[1407.76 → 1411.10] we pray in the name of Jesus amen
[1411.10 → 1422.74] so have any of you ever heard of the tiny house movement I think it's kind of cool
[1422.74 → 1429.86] maybe you've seen photos on Instagram or Facebook or on the web, or maybe you've seen one up close
[1429.86 → 1440.12] but you know people are opting to get rid of giant houses and instead live in these tiny little homes
[1440.12 → 1446.38] and now what's interesting about the tiny house movement is that the reason people are doing it
[1446.38 → 1457.12] is they want to go small on a part of their life that is normally huge you know most of us spend a large portion
[1457.12 → 1466.32] of our income on our homes whether it's our mortgage or our rent but these people who downsize and live in tiny homes
[1466.32 → 1473.48] they want to go tiny on housing for this reason because they want to go big
[1473.48 → 1482.28] in their life in a totally different direction right they want to go big on travelling they want to spend all their money on that
[1482.28 → 1489.18] or they want to live in a beautiful part of the world where they might not be able to afford to have a huge house
[1489.18 → 1492.38] or they want to go big on a certain lifestyle
[1492.38 → 1497.66] and the way that they can give their time and their financial resources
[1497.66 → 1503.08] to that is to downsize minimize other areas of their life
[1503.08 → 1507.58] and so that's the whole idea behind the tiny house movement
[1507.58 → 1512.14] to go small on one area of your life
[1512.14 → 1514.28] so that you can go big
[1514.28 → 1516.22] in another area
[1516.22 → 1519.46] and as we look at this passage this morning
[1519.46 → 1524.44] we see that this is the kind of life that God is calling us to
[1524.44 → 1528.62] that you and I are made to go big
[1528.62 → 1534.16] in one direction more than anything else that we are made to live body and soul
[1534.16 → 1540.22] our heart our mind our soul and strength totally devoted to Jesus
[1540.22 → 1544.42] and in this passage we have recorded for us
[1544.42 → 1547.26] a extraordinary moment
[1547.26 → 1549.68] a just beautiful picture
[1549.68 → 1556.28] where a woman gave God what he really wants most of all from all of us
[1556.28 → 1559.80] she gave him the devotion of her heart
[1559.80 → 1565.16] and what we see also amazingly is that Jesus receives it
[1565.16 → 1567.92] and he praises her for it
[1567.92 → 1574.96] you know Mary goes small on one on what had been her most glorious thing
[1574.96 → 1577.34] her very expensive perfume
[1577.34 → 1579.24] she gives it away
[1579.24 → 1581.24] because she is convinced
[1581.24 → 1584.86] that the direction that she needs to go big on
[1584.86 → 1588.02] is on giving praise and devotion to God
[1588.02 → 1592.24] and that's the kind of life that Jesus calls us to
[1592.24 → 1594.82] to be willing to give everything to him
[1594.82 → 1599.42] because we see that he has given us everything
[1599.42 → 1603.56] that he is the king who has generously given us all things
[1603.56 → 1609.42] and so the question I want us to ponder this morning together
[1609.42 → 1612.06] is what does it look like
[1612.06 → 1614.92] to be completely devoted to Jesus
[1614.92 → 1618.28] what does it look like to see him
[1618.28 → 1620.36] as our true king
[1620.36 → 1624.04] and how does that change everything else in our lives
[1624.04 → 1626.68] and as we look at this passage
[1626.68 → 1629.34] I'd like us to just notice a few things
[1629.34 → 1631.20] in Mark 14
[1631.20 → 1634.78] where this woman came, and she worshipped Jesus
[1634.78 → 1638.24] so there are three things I want us to look at
[1638.24 → 1639.40] and the first one is
[1639.40 → 1641.78] as we think about true devotion
[1641.78 → 1644.64] that true devotion is costly
[1644.64 → 1645.72] okay
[1645.72 → 1647.58] true devotion is costly
[1647.58 → 1650.24] so where is Mary?
[1650.82 → 1651.62] what's the setting?
[1651.74 → 1654.66] well Mary is in the house of Simon the leper
[1654.66 → 1657.44] and what is Mary doing?
[1658.44 → 1659.96] she brought to Jesus
[1659.96 → 1662.06] something that was very expensive
[1662.06 → 1663.98] you know
[1663.98 → 1665.70] and she did not say
[1665.70 → 1667.86] what a lot of us sometimes say
[1667.86 → 1668.46] which is
[1668.46 → 1669.32] you know
[1669.32 → 1669.80] Lord
[1669.80 → 1670.84] we say
[1670.84 → 1673.54] you know I would be willing to go anywhere
[1673.54 → 1675.50] you just have to ask
[1675.50 → 1676.38] and I will go
[1676.38 → 1678.20] or we say
[1678.20 → 1678.74] you know
[1678.74 → 1680.70] everything Lord I have is yours
[1680.70 → 1683.50] and I'm just going to kind of put it up on this shelf
[1683.50 → 1685.52] and anytime you want it
[1685.52 → 1686.74] just let me know
[1686.74 → 1689.74] see that's not what Mary does at all
[1689.74 → 1692.80] she actually took what she had
[1692.80 → 1695.38] and she broke it
[1695.38 → 1698.30] and she disposed of it
[1698.30 → 1700.88] upon the head of the Lord Jesus
[1700.88 → 1701.94] in a way
[1701.94 → 1704.38] that she could not possibly ever
[1704.38 → 1706.20] recover her treasure
[1706.20 → 1707.58] she didn't say
[1707.58 → 1708.38] Lord it's yours
[1708.38 → 1710.52] she gave it to him
[1710.52 → 1712.98] she made sure that it was devoted
[1712.98 → 1714.72] to him in worship
[1714.72 → 1717.44] and it was very costly
[1717.44 → 1720.48] in fact it says here in verse 3
[1720.48 → 1723.26] that it was a jar of pure nard
[1723.26 → 1725.60] it's a very expensive perfume
[1725.60 → 1728.12] and we're told in the passage
[1728.12 → 1730.32] that the cost
[1730.32 → 1730.96] the worth
[1730.96 → 1733.14] was more than a year's wages
[1733.14 → 1734.24] for the average worker
[1734.24 → 1736.80] so if we put it in today's terms
[1736.80 → 1737.42] you know
[1737.42 → 1738.72] it might be worth say
[1738.72 → 1739.68] $30,000
[1739.68 → 1741.78] for a low wageworker
[1741.78 → 1742.76] right
[1742.76 → 1743.82] that was the value
[1743.82 → 1744.74] of this gift
[1744.74 → 1745.98] $30,000
[1745.98 → 1748.66] you know
[1748.66 → 1749.54] and Mary
[1749.54 → 1750.46] as we know
[1750.46 → 1751.78] from other passages
[1751.78 → 1752.30] in scripture
[1752.30 → 1753.42] was a sister
[1753.42 → 1754.66] of Lazarus
[1754.66 → 1756.00] and so
[1756.00 → 1757.16] Mary, Martha
[1757.16 → 1758.34] and Lazarus
[1758.34 → 1759.28] as a family
[1759.28 → 1760.48] they apparently
[1760.48 → 1761.30] lived together
[1761.30 → 1763.68] and so here's what
[1763.68 → 1764.96] some scholars say
[1764.96 → 1765.90] about this gift
[1765.90 → 1767.18] they speculate
[1767.18 → 1768.90] that this gift
[1768.90 → 1769.66] probably
[1769.66 → 1772.00] was her future dowry
[1772.00 → 1772.82] right
[1772.82 → 1773.54] it was the
[1773.54 → 1774.50] the treasure
[1774.50 → 1775.42] that she would bring
[1775.42 → 1776.50] to her husband
[1776.50 → 1778.26] at their wedding
[1778.26 → 1780.76] see in those days
[1780.76 → 1782.16] property belonged
[1782.16 → 1782.72] to men
[1782.72 → 1784.68] and it was passed down
[1784.68 → 1785.76] from one generation
[1785.76 → 1786.38] to another
[1786.38 → 1787.18] from fathers
[1787.18 → 1788.56] to sons
[1788.56 → 1790.20] and daughters
[1790.20 → 1791.42] were married off
[1791.42 → 1792.24] and they shared
[1792.24 → 1793.00] in the possessions
[1793.00 → 1794.78] of their husband's property
[1794.78 → 1796.38] and so for women
[1796.38 → 1797.46] in that day
[1797.46 → 1798.62] marriage
[1798.62 → 1800.36] was extremely important
[1800.36 → 1802.72] and Mary
[1802.72 → 1803.62] of Bethany
[1803.62 → 1804.96] appeared
[1804.96 → 1806.70] to not have
[1806.70 → 1807.32] her father
[1807.32 → 1807.88] with her
[1807.88 → 1809.54] he had apparently
[1809.54 → 1810.64] passed away already
[1810.64 → 1813.18] and she was not married
[1813.18 → 1814.36] she lived with
[1814.36 → 1815.24] her older brother
[1815.24 → 1817.08] as her protector
[1817.08 → 1817.80] and provider
[1817.80 → 1819.54] and so this
[1819.54 → 1820.60] alabaster jar
[1820.60 → 1821.48] of pure nard
[1821.48 → 1822.70] was likely
[1822.70 → 1823.46] the dowry
[1823.46 → 1824.86] that her father
[1824.86 → 1825.54] gave her
[1825.54 → 1826.20] so that she
[1826.20 → 1826.94] would be able
[1826.94 → 1828.38] to have a good marriage
[1828.38 → 1830.14] so that her future
[1830.14 → 1831.64] could be secured
[1831.64 → 1833.92] that was likely
[1833.92 → 1835.32] what this perfume
[1835.32 → 1836.14] meant to her
[1836.14 → 1838.14] not only
[1838.14 → 1838.96] was it worth
[1838.96 → 1840.24] thirty thousand dollars
[1840.24 → 1841.82] not only
[1841.82 → 1842.40] was it
[1842.40 → 1843.32] her way
[1843.32 → 1843.92] of getting
[1843.92 → 1844.48] a good
[1844.48 → 1845.38] happy marriage
[1845.38 → 1846.46] it was her
[1846.46 → 1847.88] whole financial security
[1847.88 → 1848.92] it was her
[1848.92 → 1849.88] retirement fund
[1849.88 → 1850.80] it was everything
[1850.80 → 1853.24] and she breaks
[1853.24 → 1853.78] the neck
[1853.78 → 1854.44] of the bottle
[1854.44 → 1856.64] and she pours it
[1856.64 → 1857.34] on the head
[1857.34 → 1857.84] of Jesus
[1857.84 → 1859.90] and the whole room
[1859.90 → 1860.40] is just
[1860.40 → 1861.88] full of this
[1861.88 → 1862.84] aroma
[1862.84 → 1864.86] of her worship
[1864.86 → 1865.88] and her love
[1865.88 → 1866.96] for Jesus
[1866.96 → 1869.20] only
[1869.20 → 1870.66] as we look
[1870.66 → 1871.22] at the passage
[1871.22 → 1872.46] to be quickly
[1872.46 → 1873.04] met
[1873.04 → 1874.40] by anger
[1874.40 → 1875.42] and frustration
[1875.42 → 1876.44] by the disciples
[1876.44 → 1877.82] they call it
[1877.82 → 1878.86] a waste
[1878.86 → 1882.14] so
[1882.14 → 1883.76] think about this
[1883.76 → 1884.72] what would it look
[1884.72 → 1885.58] like in
[1885.58 → 1886.84] in your life
[1886.84 → 1887.88] in my life
[1887.88 → 1889.54] if we gave
[1889.54 → 1890.50] worship to Jesus
[1890.50 → 1891.52] in such a
[1891.52 → 1892.44] radical way
[1892.44 → 1893.86] that people
[1893.86 → 1894.84] looked at your life
[1894.84 → 1895.38] and said
[1895.38 → 1897.86] that is such a waste
[1897.86 → 1899.42] like really
[1899.42 → 1900.82] don't you think
[1900.82 → 1901.32] you're kind of
[1901.32 → 1902.42] going over the top
[1902.42 → 1902.66] here
[1902.66 → 1904.48] what you're doing
[1904.48 → 1905.76] is nuts
[1905.76 → 1908.62] Jerome Bars
[1908.62 → 1909.54] is a seminary
[1909.54 → 1910.02] professor
[1910.02 → 1910.80] who told this
[1910.80 → 1911.58] story about
[1911.58 → 1912.78] his father-in-law
[1912.78 → 1914.14] who's a Christian
[1914.14 → 1915.38] and his father-in-law
[1915.38 → 1916.24] lived in southern
[1916.24 → 1916.92] California
[1916.92 → 1919.00] and he was a farmer
[1919.00 → 1919.96] of fruits
[1919.96 → 1920.70] and vegetables
[1920.70 → 1922.70] and he was known
[1922.70 → 1923.68] amongst all
[1923.68 → 1924.76] of the farmworkers
[1924.76 → 1925.86] because
[1925.86 → 1927.62] he paid
[1927.62 → 1928.56] the best wages
[1928.56 → 1930.08] he cared
[1930.08 → 1930.94] very well
[1930.94 → 1931.92] for his workers
[1931.92 → 1933.98] but he was also
[1933.98 → 1935.32] known quite well
[1935.32 → 1936.70] by the IRS
[1936.70 → 1938.04] you know
[1938.04 → 1938.60] that's the
[1938.60 → 1939.22] the US
[1939.22 → 1939.90] equivalent
[1939.90 → 1940.66] to the CRA
[1940.66 → 1942.46] and the IRS
[1942.46 → 1943.16] actually
[1943.16 → 1944.90] came to his farm
[1944.90 → 1945.98] to pay him a visit
[1945.98 → 1947.46] because they
[1947.46 → 1948.58] couldn't understand it
[1948.58 → 1949.62] and they said
[1949.62 → 1950.06] to him
[1950.06 → 1951.78] you can't give
[1951.78 → 1952.86] that much money away
[1952.86 → 1953.76] it is ridiculous
[1953.76 → 1955.40] you know
[1955.40 → 1956.16] and Jerome Bars
[1956.16 → 1956.56] says
[1956.56 → 1957.28] well am I
[1957.28 → 1958.10] breaking the law
[1958.10 → 1959.20] they said
[1959.20 → 1959.72] no
[1959.72 → 1961.42] but the numbers
[1961.42 → 1963.20] just don't add up
[1963.20 → 1964.68] you can't pay
[1964.68 → 1965.24] your workers
[1965.24 → 1965.92] that much
[1965.92 → 1967.08] you can't give
[1967.08 → 1967.94] that much money
[1967.94 → 1969.02] away to your church
[1969.02 → 1969.80] into missions
[1969.80 → 1972.90] but he didn't
[1972.90 → 1973.84] think it was a waste
[1973.84 → 1975.50] he thought
[1975.50 → 1977.00] that this was
[1977.00 → 1978.56] an act of worship
[1978.56 → 1980.94] and then when
[1980.94 → 1982.24] we read this story
[1982.24 → 1983.20] Mary's actions
[1983.20 → 1983.76] you know
[1983.76 → 1984.52] we read it
[1984.52 → 1985.86] and how are we
[1985.86 → 1986.48] to respond
[1986.48 → 1987.56] it's not to say
[1987.56 → 1988.88] you know
[1988.88 → 1990.22] this tells me
[1990.22 → 1991.00] I need to live
[1991.00 → 1992.20] a more balanced life
[1992.20 → 1993.32] right
[1993.32 → 1994.12] her actions
[1994.12 → 1996.36] are calling us
[1996.36 → 1998.36] to an imbalanced life
[1998.36 → 1999.96] a life
[1999.96 → 2000.46] that is
[2000.46 → 2001.20] completely
[2001.20 → 2001.92] devoted
[2001.92 → 2003.10] to Jesus
[2003.10 → 2004.98] where the world
[2004.98 → 2006.20] will look at it
[2006.20 → 2006.76] and say
[2006.76 → 2008.42] that is crazy
[2008.42 → 2010.14] you know
[2010.14 → 2011.82] serve in your church
[2011.82 → 2012.24] sure
[2012.24 → 2013.30] but don't give
[2013.30 → 2014.28] that much time
[2014.28 → 2015.38] you know
[2015.38 → 2015.90] give money
[2015.90 → 2016.32] but don't give
[2016.32 → 2017.36] that much money
[2017.36 → 2020.98] read the Bible
[2020.98 → 2021.62] sometimes
[2021.62 → 2022.66] but don't spend
[2022.66 → 2023.84] so much time
[2023.84 → 2024.84] studying the Bible
[2024.84 → 2028.00] that's what
[2028.00 → 2029.32] it looks like
[2029.32 → 2029.98] to people
[2029.98 → 2031.32] who don't know
[2031.32 → 2031.82] Jesus
[2031.82 → 2034.52] and so the question
[2034.52 → 2035.52] for us this morning
[2035.52 → 2035.86] is
[2035.86 → 2036.70] are you willing
[2036.70 → 2037.78] to love Jesus
[2037.78 → 2039.36] with what is
[2039.36 → 2040.30] most valuable
[2040.30 → 2040.88] to you
[2040.88 → 2043.32] even if it seems
[2043.32 → 2044.78] completely nuts
[2044.78 → 2045.64] by the world's
[2045.64 → 2045.98] standards
[2045.98 → 2047.20] because
[2047.20 → 2047.62] because when we
[2047.62 → 2048.54] look at this passage
[2048.54 → 2049.74] Mary's devotion
[2049.74 → 2050.20] to Jesus
[2050.20 → 2051.92] looked completely
[2051.92 → 2053.00] crazy
[2053.00 → 2053.86] to the people
[2053.86 → 2054.72] even Jesus'
[2054.94 → 2055.94] disciples around her
[2055.94 → 2057.10] so
[2057.10 → 2057.94] so the first thing
[2057.94 → 2058.46] we see here
[2058.46 → 2059.06] is that devotion
[2059.06 → 2059.70] is costly
[2059.70 → 2061.54] the second thing
[2061.54 → 2062.62] is that devotion
[2062.62 → 2064.68] is contemplative
[2064.68 → 2065.92] or another way
[2065.92 → 2066.70] we can say it
[2066.70 → 2067.32] is that
[2067.32 → 2068.30] devotion
[2068.30 → 2069.20] sees
[2069.20 → 2070.08] clearly
[2070.08 → 2071.30] who Jesus is
[2071.30 → 2073.50] so what would
[2073.50 → 2074.46] cause Mary
[2074.46 → 2075.06] to give
[2075.06 → 2076.44] such a costly
[2076.44 → 2077.68] extravagant gift
[2077.68 → 2079.18] that's a very
[2079.18 → 2079.98] important question
[2079.98 → 2080.42] to ask
[2080.42 → 2081.66] what motivates her
[2081.66 → 2082.70] to do this
[2082.70 → 2083.94] what would
[2083.94 → 2084.44] possess
[2084.44 → 2085.28] anybody
[2085.28 → 2085.94] to do something
[2085.94 → 2086.74] so extraordinary
[2086.74 → 2089.18] and the answer
[2089.18 → 2089.76] is
[2089.76 → 2090.46] it's because
[2090.46 → 2091.96] she is one
[2091.96 → 2093.24] who sees
[2093.24 → 2094.04] clearly
[2094.04 → 2095.50] who Jesus is
[2095.50 → 2096.14] and what he came
[2096.14 → 2096.52] to do
[2096.52 → 2098.32] see
[2098.32 → 2098.92] everywhere
[2098.92 → 2099.94] Mary is
[2099.94 → 2100.36] portrayed
[2100.36 → 2100.94] in the
[2100.94 → 2101.58] gospels
[2101.58 → 2102.50] she is
[2102.50 → 2102.86] portrayed
[2102.86 → 2103.72] as someone
[2103.72 → 2104.94] who is
[2104.94 → 2105.50] listening
[2105.50 → 2106.10] to Jesus
[2106.10 → 2107.72] who is
[2107.72 → 2108.54] sitting
[2108.54 → 2109.40] at Jesus'
[2109.66 → 2110.04] feet
[2110.04 → 2110.54] as a
[2110.54 → 2111.00] disciple
[2111.00 → 2112.08] right
[2112.08 → 2112.50] who is
[2112.50 → 2113.60] taking it
[2113.60 → 2114.20] all in
[2114.20 → 2114.50] who is
[2114.50 → 2115.10] noticing
[2115.10 → 2115.92] and watching
[2115.92 → 2117.42] and listening
[2117.42 → 2118.14] to Jesus
[2118.14 → 2119.44] you know
[2119.44 → 2120.02] in the gospels
[2120.02 → 2120.42] give us
[2120.42 → 2120.80] a couple
[2120.80 → 2121.46] episodes
[2121.46 → 2123.30] that give
[2123.30 → 2124.54] us a window
[2124.54 → 2125.38] into her
[2125.38 → 2125.84] heart
[2125.84 → 2127.12] you know
[2127.12 → 2127.44] you may
[2127.44 → 2127.88] remember
[2127.88 → 2128.34] in Luke
[2128.34 → 2129.08] chapter 10
[2129.08 → 2129.72] when she
[2129.72 → 2130.30] and Martha
[2130.30 → 2131.14] are preparing
[2131.14 → 2131.92] a little
[2131.92 → 2132.24] dinner
[2132.24 → 2132.88] for Jesus
[2132.88 → 2134.16] and Martha
[2134.16 → 2135.08] was really
[2135.08 → 2135.82] good at
[2135.82 → 2136.50] fixing the
[2136.50 → 2136.82] food
[2136.82 → 2137.26] and getting
[2137.26 → 2137.68] everything
[2137.68 → 2138.06] ready
[2138.06 → 2139.18] and she
[2139.18 → 2139.48] would have
[2139.48 → 2139.92] liked to
[2139.92 → 2140.54] have some
[2140.54 → 2141.08] help from
[2141.08 → 2141.72] her sister
[2141.72 → 2143.20] rightly so
[2143.20 → 2144.90] but Mary
[2144.90 → 2145.54] was sitting
[2145.54 → 2145.96] there
[2145.96 → 2147.12] listening to
[2147.12 → 2147.58] Jesus
[2147.58 → 2148.68] instead of
[2148.68 → 2149.16] helping get
[2149.16 → 2149.48] the food
[2149.48 → 2149.82] ready
[2149.82 → 2151.72] and Martha
[2151.72 → 2154.16] fussed at
[2154.16 → 2154.42] Mary
[2154.42 → 2155.54] but Jesus
[2155.54 → 2155.92] said to
[2155.92 → 2156.26] Martha
[2156.26 → 2157.56] Mary has
[2157.56 → 2158.02] chosen
[2158.02 → 2158.68] the one
[2158.68 → 2159.00] thing
[2159.00 → 2159.48] needful
[2159.48 → 2160.38] and it
[2160.38 → 2160.80] will not
[2160.80 → 2161.34] be taken
[2161.34 → 2161.92] away from
[2161.92 → 2162.18] her
[2162.18 → 2163.56] so we
[2163.56 → 2164.18] see Mary
[2164.18 → 2164.54] there
[2164.54 → 2165.94] listening to
[2165.94 → 2166.16] Jesus
[2166.16 → 2167.14] focusing on
[2167.14 → 2167.56] Jesus
[2167.56 → 2169.30] we get
[2169.30 → 2169.96] another window
[2169.96 → 2170.60] into her
[2170.60 → 2171.00] heart
[2171.00 → 2171.56] in John
[2171.56 → 2172.40] chapter 11
[2172.40 → 2173.64] when her
[2173.64 → 2174.42] older brother
[2174.42 → 2175.14] Lazarus
[2175.14 → 2175.58] has been
[2175.58 → 2175.96] dead for
[2175.96 → 2176.62] three days
[2176.62 → 2178.76] and Jesus
[2178.76 → 2180.36] feels
[2180.36 → 2181.34] her sorrow
[2181.34 → 2182.08] her pain
[2182.08 → 2182.74] her grief
[2182.74 → 2184.06] and he
[2184.06 → 2184.74] weeps
[2184.74 → 2185.22] at the
[2185.22 → 2185.56] tomb
[2185.56 → 2186.38] of Lazarus
[2186.38 → 2188.08] and I
[2188.08 → 2188.44] think it's
[2188.44 → 2188.98] not only
[2188.98 → 2189.70] that he's
[2189.70 → 2190.14] grieving
[2190.14 → 2190.70] over the
[2190.70 → 2191.08] loss of
[2191.08 → 2191.42] his own
[2191.42 → 2191.76] friend
[2191.76 → 2192.18] certainly
[2192.18 → 2193.02] he is
[2193.02 → 2194.06] but I
[2194.06 → 2194.58] think he's
[2194.58 → 2195.12] filled
[2195.12 → 2195.38] with
[2195.38 → 2196.16] compassion
[2196.16 → 2197.66] for Mary
[2197.66 → 2198.28] and Martha
[2198.28 → 2199.16] who had
[2199.16 → 2200.08] just lost
[2200.08 → 2201.34] the protector
[2201.34 → 2202.02] and provider
[2202.02 → 2202.46] that they
[2202.46 → 2203.06] had in
[2203.06 → 2203.54] their brother
[2203.54 → 2204.98] and so
[2204.98 → 2205.36] Jesus
[2205.36 → 2206.08] calls
[2206.08 → 2206.78] Lazarus
[2206.78 → 2207.18] forth
[2207.18 → 2207.58] from
[2207.58 → 2207.80] the
[2207.80 → 2208.26] grave
[2208.26 → 2208.98] and
[2208.98 → 2209.50] gives
[2209.50 → 2209.80] him
[2209.80 → 2210.18] back
[2210.18 → 2210.42] to
[2210.42 → 2210.64] his
[2210.64 → 2211.00] sisters
[2211.00 → 2213.08] and in
[2213.08 → 2213.40] that
[2213.40 → 2213.96] moment
[2213.96 → 2215.26] as
[2215.26 → 2215.96] Mary
[2215.96 → 2216.84] receives
[2216.84 → 2217.36] the gift
[2217.36 → 2217.80] back
[2217.80 → 2218.20] of her
[2218.20 → 2218.60] brother
[2218.60 → 2220.44] her heart
[2220.44 → 2220.98] is telling
[2220.98 → 2221.34] her
[2221.34 → 2222.22] that this
[2222.22 → 2222.68] Jesus
[2222.68 → 2223.28] cares
[2223.28 → 2223.94] about me
[2223.94 → 2225.24] that he
[2225.24 → 2226.50] I can
[2226.50 → 2227.30] trust him
[2227.30 → 2227.92] that he
[2227.92 → 2228.58] is good
[2228.58 → 2229.30] that he
[2229.30 → 2229.76] will watch
[2229.76 → 2230.20] out for
[2230.20 → 2230.46] me
[2230.46 → 2232.22] so we
[2232.22 → 2232.58] read
[2232.58 → 2233.46] this story
[2233.46 → 2233.96] now
[2233.96 → 2234.46] of this
[2234.46 → 2234.86] dinner
[2234.86 → 2235.52] at Simon's
[2235.52 → 2235.88] house
[2235.88 → 2236.80] this is
[2236.80 → 2237.34] all that
[2237.34 → 2237.96] was moving
[2237.96 → 2238.60] in Mary's
[2238.60 → 2238.96] heart
[2238.96 → 2240.88] in fact
[2240.88 → 2241.20] Jesus
[2241.20 → 2241.72] said in
[2241.72 → 2242.44] verse 8
[2242.44 → 2243.38] that she
[2243.38 → 2244.18] anointed
[2244.18 → 2244.74] him with
[2244.74 → 2245.20] oil
[2245.20 → 2246.66] to prepare
[2246.66 → 2247.40] him for
[2247.40 → 2248.10] his burial
[2248.10 → 2249.58] see Mary
[2249.58 → 2250.00] has been
[2250.00 → 2250.56] listening
[2250.56 → 2251.72] three times
[2251.72 → 2252.24] already
[2252.24 → 2253.22] Jesus has
[2253.22 → 2253.80] said I
[2253.80 → 2254.36] am I going
[2254.36 → 2255.02] to Jerusalem
[2255.02 → 2255.62] to die
[2255.62 → 2257.56] most people
[2257.56 → 2258.16] didn't get
[2258.16 → 2258.34] it
[2258.34 → 2258.86] Mary
[2258.86 → 2260.18] is getting
[2260.18 → 2260.56] it
[2260.56 → 2262.40] when Jesus
[2262.40 → 2262.92] told his
[2262.92 → 2263.66] disciples that
[2263.66 → 2264.42] he would be
[2264.42 → 2264.96] crucified
[2264.96 → 2265.46] during the
[2265.46 → 2265.94] Passover
[2265.94 → 2266.70] she
[2266.70 → 2267.24] recognized
[2267.24 → 2267.80] that at
[2267.80 → 2268.32] Passover
[2268.32 → 2269.16] they
[2269.16 → 2269.76] sacrifice
[2269.76 → 2270.24] a lamb
[2270.24 → 2271.94] a lamb
[2271.94 → 2272.36] that would
[2272.36 → 2273.18] symbolically
[2273.18 → 2274.30] cover the
[2274.30 → 2274.84] sins of
[2274.84 → 2275.26] Israel
[2275.26 → 2276.78] and Mary
[2276.78 → 2277.70] is realizing
[2277.70 → 2278.24] that the
[2278.24 → 2278.92] time of
[2278.92 → 2279.36] symbols
[2279.36 → 2279.98] is over
[2279.98 → 2281.24] that the
[2281.24 → 2282.24] person before
[2282.24 → 2282.46] her
[2282.46 → 2282.88] Jesus
[2282.88 → 2284.22] is the
[2284.22 → 2284.64] lamb of
[2284.64 → 2284.96] God
[2284.96 → 2285.84] who will
[2285.84 → 2286.36] die to
[2286.36 → 2287.04] take away
[2287.04 → 2287.56] the sins
[2287.56 → 2287.86] of the
[2287.86 → 2288.22] world
[2288.22 → 2289.86] so she
[2289.86 → 2290.52] is preparing
[2290.52 → 2291.14] him
[2291.14 → 2292.42] for his
[2292.42 → 2292.82] burial
[2292.82 → 2294.42] that's
[2294.42 → 2294.64] what
[2294.64 → 2295.56] Mary
[2295.56 → 2296.16] sees
[2296.16 → 2298.18] so here's
[2298.18 → 2298.72] a quote
[2298.72 → 2300.16] by John
[2300.16 → 2300.60] Piper
[2300.60 → 2301.30] that I
[2301.30 → 2301.74] think really
[2301.74 → 2302.18] gets to
[2302.18 → 2302.48] the heart
[2302.48 → 2302.92] of this
[2302.92 → 2304.60] he says
[2304.60 → 2306.04] nothing
[2306.04 → 2307.06] makes God
[2307.06 → 2308.06] more supreme
[2308.06 → 2308.64] and more
[2308.64 → 2309.50] central in
[2309.50 → 2309.88] worship
[2309.88 → 2311.34] than when
[2311.34 → 2311.96] a people
[2311.96 → 2313.26] is utterly
[2313.26 → 2314.04] persuaded
[2314.04 → 2315.44] that nothing
[2315.44 → 2316.10] is going
[2316.10 → 2316.72] to bring
[2316.72 → 2317.62] satisfaction
[2317.62 → 2318.98] to their
[2318.98 → 2319.56] sinful
[2319.56 → 2320.22] guilty
[2320.22 → 2320.68] aching
[2320.68 → 2321.20] hearts
[2321.20 → 2322.04] besides
[2322.04 → 2322.50] God
[2322.50 → 2323.78] this
[2323.78 → 2324.40] conviction
[2324.40 → 2324.84] breeds
[2324.84 → 2325.28] people
[2325.28 → 2325.70] who go
[2325.70 → 2326.30] hard
[2326.30 → 2326.78] after
[2326.78 → 2327.22] God
[2327.22 → 2327.74] on Sunday
[2327.74 → 2328.14] morning
[2328.14 → 2329.40] they are
[2329.40 → 2330.14] not confused
[2330.14 → 2330.90] about why
[2330.90 → 2331.38] they are
[2331.38 → 2331.90] in a worship
[2331.90 → 2332.44] service
[2332.44 → 2333.72] they do
[2333.72 → 2334.28] not view
[2334.28 → 2334.98] songs
[2334.98 → 2335.66] and prayers
[2335.66 → 2336.56] and sermons
[2336.56 → 2337.58] as mere
[2337.58 → 2338.20] traditions
[2338.20 → 2338.86] or mere
[2338.86 → 2339.34] duties
[2339.34 → 2340.12] or something
[2340.12 → 2340.78] to endure
[2340.78 → 2342.30] they see
[2342.30 → 2342.82] them as
[2342.82 → 2343.48] means
[2343.48 → 2344.14] of getting
[2344.14 → 2344.90] to God
[2344.90 → 2346.26] or God
[2346.26 → 2346.84] getting to
[2346.84 → 2347.24] them
[2347.24 → 2348.86] for more
[2348.86 → 2350.26] of his
[2350.26 → 2351.00] fullness
[2351.00 → 2353.14] see
[2353.14 → 2353.58] Mary
[2353.58 → 2354.24] also
[2354.24 → 2354.80] is not
[2354.80 → 2355.32] confused
[2355.32 → 2355.90] about whom
[2355.90 → 2356.20] Jesus
[2356.20 → 2356.68] is
[2356.68 → 2357.54] she sees
[2357.54 → 2357.94] Jesus
[2357.94 → 2358.66] as the
[2358.66 → 2359.46] only one
[2359.46 → 2359.86] who can
[2359.86 → 2360.52] satisfy
[2360.52 → 2362.00] all of her
[2362.00 → 2362.50] needs
[2362.50 → 2363.16] and desires
[2363.16 → 2364.74] she is not
[2364.74 → 2365.26] confused
[2365.26 → 2365.90] when she is
[2365.90 → 2366.86] fully devoted
[2366.86 → 2367.40] to him
[2367.40 → 2368.58] seeking
[2368.58 → 2370.16] to receive
[2370.16 → 2370.78] from him
[2370.78 → 2371.56] only that
[2371.56 → 2371.98] which he
[2371.98 → 2372.60] can give
[2372.60 → 2374.20] and that
[2374.20 → 2374.70] is what
[2374.70 → 2375.74] moves her
[2375.74 → 2376.34] motivates
[2376.34 → 2376.94] her
[2376.94 → 2377.78] to be
[2377.78 → 2378.28] devoted
[2378.28 → 2379.68] to Jesus
[2379.68 → 2381.12] she sees
[2381.12 → 2382.20] and contemplates
[2382.20 → 2383.02] who he
[2383.02 → 2383.32] is
[2383.32 → 2383.72] he is
[2383.72 → 2384.18] the king
[2384.18 → 2386.58] so lastly
[2386.58 → 2387.96] the third
[2387.96 → 2388.66] thing I want
[2388.66 → 2389.06] us to see
[2389.06 → 2389.60] in this passage
[2389.60 → 2390.32] is not only
[2390.32 → 2390.82] that this
[2390.82 → 2391.68] true life
[2391.68 → 2392.30] of devotion
[2392.30 → 2393.30] is costly
[2393.30 → 2394.48] not only
[2394.48 → 2394.72] is it
[2394.72 → 2395.76] contemplative
[2395.76 → 2396.76] seeing clearly
[2396.76 → 2397.24] who Jesus
[2397.24 → 2397.68] is
[2397.68 → 2399.00] but thirdly
[2399.00 → 2399.48] it is
[2399.48 → 2400.68] commended
[2400.68 → 2401.36] richly
[2401.36 → 2402.24] by the
[2402.24 → 2402.76] Lord Jesus
[2402.76 → 2404.42] so in
[2404.42 → 2404.66] verses
[2404.66 → 2405.02] four
[2405.02 → 2405.66] and five
[2405.66 → 2406.08] though
[2406.08 → 2407.16] we see
[2407.16 → 2407.58] that true
[2407.58 → 2408.00] devotion
[2408.00 → 2408.44] is not
[2408.44 → 2408.80] always
[2408.80 → 2409.48] appreciated
[2409.48 → 2410.02] by other
[2410.02 → 2410.42] people
[2410.42 → 2412.26] it says
[2412.26 → 2412.78] some of
[2412.78 → 2413.58] those present
[2413.58 → 2414.24] were saying
[2414.24 → 2415.14] indignantly
[2415.14 → 2415.64] to one
[2415.64 → 2415.98] another
[2415.98 → 2417.14] why this
[2417.14 → 2417.58] waste
[2417.58 → 2418.24] of perfume
[2418.24 → 2419.28] it could
[2419.28 → 2419.54] have been
[2419.54 → 2419.98] sold for
[2419.98 → 2420.30] more than
[2420.30 → 2420.70] a year's
[2420.70 → 2421.06] wages
[2421.06 → 2421.80] and the
[2421.80 → 2422.00] money
[2422.00 → 2422.28] given
[2422.28 → 2422.64] to the
[2422.64 → 2422.90] poor
[2422.90 → 2423.80] and they
[2423.80 → 2424.54] rebuked
[2424.54 → 2424.68] her
[2424.68 → 2425.58] harshly
[2425.58 → 2428.30] if you
[2428.30 → 2428.66] look at
[2428.66 → 2429.34] the response
[2429.34 → 2429.72] to what
[2429.72 → 2430.52] Mary does
[2430.52 → 2431.40] the disciples
[2431.40 → 2432.70] are mad
[2432.70 → 2434.32] it would
[2434.32 → 2434.56] have been
[2434.56 → 2435.20] one thing
[2435.20 → 2435.42] you know
[2435.42 → 2435.70] if they
[2435.70 → 2436.06] said
[2436.06 → 2436.64] they were
[2436.64 → 2437.22] like shocked
[2437.22 → 2437.68] like whoa
[2437.68 → 2438.12] what's going
[2438.12 → 2438.46] on
[2438.46 → 2439.00] or they
[2439.00 → 2439.88] were surprised
[2439.88 → 2440.58] or maybe
[2440.58 → 2440.92] they were
[2440.92 → 2441.52] curious
[2441.52 → 2442.64] but it
[2442.64 → 2443.18] says they
[2443.18 → 2443.54] were
[2443.54 → 2444.28] indignant
[2444.28 → 2446.62] no they're
[2446.62 → 2447.20] saying what
[2447.20 → 2447.72] a waste
[2447.72 → 2448.22] this could
[2448.22 → 2448.62] have been
[2448.62 → 2449.78] this you
[2449.78 → 2450.24] poured out
[2450.24 → 2450.84] thirty thousand
[2450.84 → 2451.38] dollars on
[2451.38 → 2451.82] the ground
[2451.82 → 2453.12] we could
[2453.12 → 2453.42] have fed
[2453.42 → 2453.78] the poor
[2453.78 → 2454.24] with it
[2454.24 → 2455.82] you know
[2455.82 → 2456.56] and we
[2456.56 → 2457.28] can understand
[2457.28 → 2458.28] why they
[2458.28 → 2458.62] might be
[2458.62 → 2459.28] so angry
[2459.28 → 2460.00] it seems
[2460.00 → 2460.82] so wasteful
[2460.82 → 2462.80] but notice
[2462.80 → 2463.22] in verses
[2463.22 → 2463.72] six and
[2463.72 → 2464.04] seven
[2464.04 → 2465.14] how Jesus
[2465.14 → 2466.64] views
[2466.64 → 2467.64] the entire
[2467.64 → 2468.08] thing
[2468.08 → 2469.46] he doesn't
[2469.46 → 2469.88] say
[2469.88 → 2470.68] yeah you
[2470.68 → 2471.14] know Mary
[2471.14 → 2472.60] you really
[2472.60 → 2472.94] should have
[2472.94 → 2473.38] taken care
[2473.38 → 2473.88] of the poor
[2473.88 → 2474.22] you know
[2474.22 → 2474.94] don't pour
[2474.94 → 2475.72] this perfume
[2475.72 → 2476.26] out on me
[2476.26 → 2476.82] that's not
[2476.82 → 2477.48] necessary
[2477.48 → 2479.14] like that's
[2479.14 → 2479.48] not what
[2479.48 → 2479.98] he said
[2479.98 → 2481.52] what did
[2481.52 → 2482.24] Jesus say
[2482.24 → 2483.58] he said
[2483.58 → 2484.56] why are
[2484.56 → 2485.12] you bothering
[2485.12 → 2485.48] her
[2485.48 → 2487.14] she has
[2487.14 → 2487.52] done
[2487.52 → 2488.36] a beautiful
[2488.36 → 2488.74] thing
[2488.74 → 2489.18] for me
[2489.18 → 2491.28] in those
[2491.28 → 2491.70] words
[2491.70 → 2492.28] a beautiful
[2492.28 → 2492.84] thing
[2492.84 → 2493.74] can be
[2493.74 → 2494.44] translated
[2494.44 → 2495.60] a good
[2495.60 → 2496.04] work
[2496.04 → 2497.44] right
[2497.44 → 2497.92] when we
[2497.92 → 2498.22] give
[2498.22 → 2498.70] devotion
[2498.70 → 2499.20] to Jesus
[2499.20 → 2499.78] it's not
[2499.78 → 2500.60] a waste
[2500.60 → 2501.50] it's a
[2501.50 → 2502.22] good work
[2502.22 → 2503.14] it's a
[2503.14 → 2503.90] good thing
[2503.90 → 2504.60] to do
[2504.60 → 2505.80] it's a
[2505.80 → 2506.14] it's an
[2506.14 → 2506.76] action
[2506.76 → 2507.70] of worship
[2507.70 → 2509.12] and Jesus
[2509.12 → 2509.80] is pleased
[2509.80 → 2510.24] with it
[2510.24 → 2511.58] he says
[2511.58 → 2511.82] you have
[2511.82 → 2512.16] done a
[2512.16 → 2512.54] beautiful
[2512.54 → 2513.04] thing for
[2513.04 → 2513.18] me
[2513.18 → 2513.90] he commends
[2513.90 → 2514.16] her
[2514.16 → 2515.24] you know
[2515.24 → 2515.68] and those
[2515.68 → 2516.22] are words
[2516.22 → 2516.56] that we
[2516.56 → 2517.38] long to
[2517.38 → 2517.86] hear
[2517.86 → 2518.78] from our
[2518.78 → 2519.22] Lord
[2519.22 → 2520.48] you know
[2520.48 → 2520.84] it's very
[2520.84 → 2521.12] much
[2521.12 → 2521.58] kind of
[2521.58 → 2521.94] like what
[2521.94 → 2522.64] Jesus said
[2522.64 → 2522.88] in the
[2522.88 → 2523.20] parable
[2523.20 → 2523.44] of the
[2523.44 → 2523.86] talents
[2523.86 → 2524.78] where he
[2524.78 → 2525.00] says
[2525.00 → 2525.72] well done
[2525.72 → 2526.26] good and
[2526.26 → 2526.62] faithful
[2526.62 → 2527.36] servant
[2527.36 → 2529.62] you know
[2529.62 → 2530.42] so
[2530.42 → 2531.94] when we
[2531.94 → 2532.36] think about
[2532.36 → 2532.74] our own
[2532.74 → 2533.22] lives
[2533.22 → 2534.48] here we
[2534.48 → 2534.98] are in
[2534.98 → 2535.42] the midst
[2535.42 → 2535.96] of
[2535.96 → 2537.50] an anxious
[2537.50 → 2538.10] time
[2538.10 → 2539.86] where we
[2539.86 → 2540.92] some of
[2540.92 → 2541.14] us
[2541.14 → 2541.60] might be
[2541.60 → 2542.08] feeling
[2542.08 → 2542.70] quite
[2542.70 → 2543.62] nervous
[2543.62 → 2544.16] quite
[2544.16 → 2544.86] unsure
[2544.86 → 2546.84] but when
[2546.84 → 2547.56] we lift
[2547.56 → 2548.06] up our
[2548.06 → 2548.48] hearts
[2548.48 → 2549.06] to God
[2549.06 → 2550.26] when we
[2550.26 → 2550.76] remember
[2550.76 → 2551.22] who he
[2551.22 → 2551.48] is
[2551.48 → 2551.74] and when
[2551.74 → 2552.26] we put
[2552.26 → 2552.72] our trust
[2552.72 → 2553.14] in him
[2553.14 → 2554.26] that's an
[2554.26 → 2554.70] act of
[2554.70 → 2555.20] devotion
[2555.20 → 2556.32] and Jesus
[2556.32 → 2556.88] says
[2556.88 → 2557.32] it's a
[2557.32 → 2557.68] beautiful
[2557.68 → 2558.26] thing to
[2558.26 → 2558.52] me
[2558.52 → 2560.16] you know
[2560.16 → 2560.54] when we
[2560.54 → 2561.26] are struggling
[2561.26 → 2561.96] in our
[2561.96 → 2562.58] relationships
[2562.58 → 2563.26] maybe we've
[2563.26 → 2563.80] been at home
[2563.80 → 2564.44] too long
[2564.44 → 2564.84] with our
[2564.84 → 2565.26] spouse
[2565.26 → 2566.12] or with
[2566.12 → 2566.28] our
[2566.28 → 2566.68] kids
[2566.68 → 2567.66] we're
[2567.66 → 2568.08] starting to
[2568.08 → 2568.34] get on
[2568.34 → 2568.86] each other's
[2568.86 → 2569.20] nerves
[2569.20 → 2570.80] but when
[2570.80 → 2571.16] we are
[2571.16 → 2571.96] able to
[2571.96 → 2573.42] be patient
[2573.42 → 2574.72] to forgive
[2574.72 → 2575.66] each other's
[2575.66 → 2576.54] wrongdoings
[2576.54 → 2577.96] Jesus says
[2577.96 → 2578.38] it is a
[2578.38 → 2578.74] beautiful
[2578.74 → 2579.30] thing to
[2579.30 → 2579.60] me
[2579.60 → 2581.36] you know
[2581.36 → 2581.68] when we
[2581.68 → 2582.46] gather as
[2582.46 → 2582.98] a church
[2582.98 → 2584.72] even when
[2584.72 → 2585.46] on you
[2585.46 → 2585.52] know
[2585.52 → 2585.82] a Sunday
[2585.82 → 2586.18] morning
[2586.18 → 2586.46] it'd be
[2586.46 → 2587.32] easy to
[2587.32 → 2588.86] to not
[2588.86 → 2589.44] gather
[2589.44 → 2590.46] when we
[2590.46 → 2590.92] don't have
[2590.92 → 2591.10] to
[2591.10 → 2591.36] we have
[2591.36 → 2591.56] a good
[2591.56 → 2592.12] excuse
[2592.12 → 2594.36] even when
[2594.36 → 2594.56] we're
[2594.56 → 2595.02] sitting in
[2595.02 → 2595.42] our living
[2595.42 → 2595.80] rooms
[2595.80 → 2596.08] or at
[2596.08 → 2596.20] our
[2596.20 → 2596.48] kitchen
[2596.48 → 2596.92] table
[2596.92 → 2598.08] and we
[2598.08 → 2598.68] sing
[2598.68 → 2599.64] and we
[2599.64 → 2599.98] confess
[2599.98 → 2600.74] our sin
[2600.74 → 2601.64] we listen
[2601.64 → 2602.14] to God's
[2602.14 → 2602.48] word
[2602.48 → 2603.46] it's a
[2603.46 → 2603.80] beautiful
[2603.80 → 2604.30] thing
[2604.30 → 2605.30] to God
[2605.30 → 2605.70] when we
[2605.70 → 2606.18] do so
[2606.18 → 2608.34] and when
[2608.34 → 2608.78] we go
[2608.78 → 2609.36] out into
[2609.36 → 2609.90] the world
[2609.90 → 2610.68] you know
[2610.68 → 2611.04] when we
[2611.04 → 2611.54] labour
[2611.54 → 2612.06] at our
[2612.06 → 2612.46] jobs
[2612.46 → 2612.76] whatever
[2612.76 → 2613.36] they are
[2613.36 → 2613.64] and when
[2613.64 → 2614.14] we raise
[2614.14 → 2614.78] our kids
[2614.78 → 2615.64] when we
[2615.64 → 2616.28] care for
[2616.28 → 2616.68] the people
[2616.68 → 2617.46] around us
[2617.46 → 2618.38] often in
[2618.38 → 2618.74] ways that
[2618.74 → 2619.74] other people
[2619.74 → 2620.16] will never
[2620.16 → 2620.54] see
[2620.54 → 2622.34] Jesus says
[2622.34 → 2622.66] it's a
[2622.66 → 2623.00] beautiful
[2623.00 → 2623.64] thing for
[2623.64 → 2623.92] me
[2623.92 → 2625.84] you know
[2625.84 → 2626.60] that's how
[2626.60 → 2627.18] the Lord
[2627.18 → 2628.08] sees true
[2628.08 → 2628.56] devotion
[2628.56 → 2630.44] he receives
[2630.44 → 2630.84] it
[2630.84 → 2632.44] and he
[2632.44 → 2633.04] commends
[2633.04 → 2633.48] us for
[2633.48 → 2633.72] it
[2633.72 → 2635.74] and he
[2635.74 → 2636.42] says why
[2636.42 → 2636.84] in verse
[2636.84 → 2637.42] seven he
[2637.42 → 2637.90] says the
[2637.90 → 2638.44] poor you
[2638.44 → 2639.00] will always
[2639.00 → 2639.38] have
[2639.38 → 2640.74] right he
[2640.74 → 2641.08] says you
[2641.08 → 2641.62] will always
[2641.62 → 2642.08] be able to
[2642.08 → 2642.50] serve me
[2642.50 → 2642.80] in this
[2642.80 → 2643.12] way
[2643.12 → 2643.76] but the
[2643.76 → 2644.50] most important
[2644.50 → 2645.08] thing
[2645.08 → 2646.04] is to
[2646.04 → 2646.68] give your
[2646.68 → 2647.42] heart
[2647.42 → 2648.52] and your
[2648.52 → 2649.22] life
[2649.22 → 2650.48] your body
[2650.48 → 2650.90] and your
[2650.90 → 2651.36] soul
[2651.36 → 2651.82] to the
[2651.82 → 2652.12] living
[2652.12 → 2652.68] God
[2652.68 → 2653.36] who
[2653.36 → 2653.88] loves
[2653.88 → 2654.16] you
[2654.16 → 2654.46] and who
[2654.46 → 2654.62] has
[2654.62 → 2654.94] given
[2654.94 → 2655.40] himself
[2655.40 → 2655.82] for
[2655.82 → 2656.10] you
[2656.10 → 2658.02] you
[2658.02 → 2658.68] know
[2658.68 → 2659.04] Jesus
[2659.04 → 2659.54] showed
[2659.54 → 2660.16] his love
[2660.16 → 2660.58] for
[2660.58 → 2660.86] Mary
[2660.86 → 2661.54] he
[2661.54 → 2662.16] defended
[2662.16 → 2662.52] her
[2662.52 → 2662.88] amongst
[2662.88 → 2663.06] the
[2663.06 → 2663.24] other
[2663.24 → 2663.70] disciples
[2663.70 → 2664.50] he
[2664.50 → 2665.10] praises
[2665.10 → 2665.46] her
[2665.46 → 2666.00] in front
[2666.00 → 2666.14] of
[2666.14 → 2666.38] them
[2666.38 → 2667.54] but he
[2667.54 → 2668.02] shows
[2668.02 → 2668.26] his
[2668.26 → 2668.60] love
[2668.60 → 2669.40] ultimately
[2669.40 → 2670.52] by dying
[2670.52 → 2670.86] for
[2670.86 → 2671.18] her
[2671.18 → 2672.28] you
[2672.28 → 2672.34] know
[2672.34 → 2672.46] the
[2672.46 → 2672.82] apostle
[2672.82 → 2673.24] John
[2673.24 → 2673.54] writes
[2673.54 → 2673.70] in
[2673.70 → 2673.90] first
[2673.90 → 2674.14] John
[2674.14 → 2674.46] chapter

[2695.56 → 2695.82] give
[2695.82 → 2696.16] something
[2696.16 → 2696.34] that
[2696.34 → 2696.48] was

[3161.96 → 3169.90] be full of the glory of God. Let us glimpse this fulfillment even now. Let us be people
[3169.90 → 3180.48] of hope because of the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It is in his name we pray. Amen.
[3185.68 → 3191.62] We're going to have an offering. Even though you're not here with us today, we can still
[3191.62 → 3197.32] just think about this offering cause. It is for UBC Okanagan and the work of Reverend Todd
[3197.32 → 3204.36] Stat ham there. We've been supporting that work at UBC Okanagan and his ministry for many, many years.
[3204.90 → 3211.24] You can give your offering by dropping off a check or cash at the church. There's a box in the foyer
[3211.24 → 3216.78] Tuesday through Friday that someone will be here. Don't come close, just drop it off in the foyer.
[3216.78 → 3223.98] Also, you can mail your check to the church, and please indicate the cause, which would be
[3223.98 → 3231.90] just BCO, UBC Okanagan. This week, we will be mailing a newsletter to everyone in our congregation
[3231.90 → 3238.08] and in there you will find additional information on submitting your offerings and pledges.
[3238.08 → 3249.12] offs
[3249.12 → 3251.12] Amen.
[3279.12 → 3288.88] And now we end our service with God's blessing upon us.
[3288.88 → 3292.92] So I invite you wherever you are, why don't you stand with us?
[3293.86 → 3296.30] And we will have God's blessing.
[3296.44 → 3297.90] We will sing our final song afterward.
[3298.48 → 3305.86] So I also invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the blessing of our Heavenly Father.
[3305.86 → 3316.16] Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy.
[3316.76 → 3326.56] To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time, now and forever.
[3327.34 → 3327.64] Amen.
[3335.86 → 3350.86] Your peace within us, Lord, will stand, surpassing all we understand.
