• The importance of speaking the truth and love of Jesus in one's words
• Two questions to consider: why the religious leaders' feathers were ruffled and how Peter and John responded
• The passage discusses the apostles teaching about the resurrection of the dead, which upset the high priestly court who had previously put Jesus on trial and handed him over to be crucified
• The emotional state of the leaders, described as "greatly disturbed" or "vexed", and their intimidating power over Peter and John
• Peter and John's lack of formal education or training as Levitical priests
• The Jewish leaders' perception that they were usurping authority by teaching in the temple
• Their anger at the spread of Christianity, particularly the proclamation of Jesus' resurrection and their own fear of losing influence and control.
• The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection
• Peter and John preached that Jesus was raised from the dead and that those who trust in him would experience resurrection of life
• The high priestly court saw them as disturbers of the peace and enemies of the truth
• The leaders had a problem with the preaching, not the healing itself
• They tried to silence the apostles by forbidding them from speaking or teaching in Jesus' name
• The speaker believes the Christian church is facing persecution from an initial stage of intimidation and psychological pressure.
• This type of persecution can lead to a gradual erosion of the church's influence and message.
• In contrast, physical persecution has historically led to growth and expansion in the church.
• Examples such as Iran show that despite severe restrictions on Christians, the church continues to thrive and grow.
• The speaker argues that this is because persecution can be seen as proof of the power and authenticity of Christianity.
• The speaker describes modern cultural norms as an "incredible threat" to the church, similar to Satan's greatest attack.
• Attempts to reconcile Christian faith with modern cultural norms can lead to compromise and watering down of Jesus' teachings.
• The speaker argues that faithful disobedience is necessary in the face of persecution, rather than taking up arms or trying to overthrow governments.
• This involves proclaiming the gospel even if it means disobeying authorities and accepting consequences.
• Trusting God's placement of governing authorities for good is essential in this approach.

• The connection between faith, testing, and the power of the Holy Spirit
• The significance of being "filled with the Holy Spirit" for Christians
• The Holy Spirit's primary role is to witness to the reality and truth of Jesus Christ
• The Holy Spirit fills believers with power, love, and self-discipline, enabling them to live out their Christian life
• Being spirit-filled means being assured of God's everlasting love for them, giving confidence and motivation to share Jesus with others
• The spirit-filled life involves boldly proclaiming Jesus, even in the face of opposition or ridicule
• Jesus is the only way to salvation, making the Christian faith exclusive
