[0.00 → 0.50] I...
[0.50 → 13.78] Okay.
[14.44 → 15.74] Good morning, everybody.
[16.10 → 17.24] We're a bit late.
[18.88 → 21.56] This is the Ladder Christian Reformed Church
[21.56 → 25.64] and our service beginning at 1035 or thereabouts.
[25.86 → 28.82] I had hoped to begin this service like Jake did last week
[28.82 → 32.64] with a sunny day outside with 50 people in here
[32.64 → 34.70] and, of course, starting on time.
[35.30 → 37.34] And none of those things are true this morning.
[37.56 → 41.14] It's threatening rain, and I'm talking to the media team
[41.14 → 46.38] because, as most of you know, we're all worshipping at home again.
[46.78 → 47.84] But the Lord is here.
[48.04 → 49.06] The Lord is in this place.
[49.32 → 50.80] The Lord is in your living room.
[51.42 → 54.02] And we are worshipping together this morning.
[54.12 → 56.56] Let's have a good time honouring him.
[56.56 → 60.98] Today, I've got with me Tony and Harry,
[61.34 → 63.78] who will be joining us as vocalists pretty soon.
[64.22 → 65.58] Gatlin, who's on piano.
[66.24 → 69.96] Our sound team is Michaela and Ryan.
[71.14 → 74.14] Later, Pastor Jason True will open God's Word.
[74.62 → 77.76] Instead of working through another chapter of Acts this week,
[77.82 → 81.20] he's going to shift back to Psalm 1, and he'll explain why.
[81.20 → 87.72] Today, our offering is for the South Delta Food Bank.
[88.54 → 92.04] This organization provides supplemental support in the way of groceries
[92.04 → 95.02] to all those dealing with short or long-term poverty.
[96.30 → 100.32] A number of people in our congregation, or well-known to us,
[100.98 → 103.16] are directly involved with this weekly distribution.
[103.16 → 106.28] This includes Bart and Adriana, Joe and Shirley,
[106.68 → 109.50] Hope and Anita, Pete and Pat, WIM,
[109.86 → 112.10] and perhaps somebody that I'm unaware of.
[112.46 → 114.76] So keep that in mind as you make an offering
[114.76 → 116.96] for South Delta Food Bank this morning.
[117.54 → 121.56] Next week, the offering is for the new immigrant support.
[122.44 → 124.68] Our church, through the very diligent efforts
[124.68 → 126.08] of our immigrant support group,
[126.34 → 129.00] and that of many others in the congregation who help them,
[129.22 → 132.76] have sponsored a number of families in the past years.
[133.16 → 135.18] This includes Justin and Julian,
[135.98 → 139.10] Mustafa and Far, Abbas, Violet,
[139.76 → 144.66] Human, Disbar and Paula, Alphonse and Denise,
[145.34 → 149.92] Emmanuel and Airway, Billy Hanna, Kikuyu and Kia,
[149.92 → 154.00] and soon, Valid and Benz.
[154.58 → 155.76] The list is growing.
[157.76 → 161.70] While there is no immediate urgent financial need,
[161.70 → 164.50] the support committee did point out to me
[164.50 → 168.88] that two new families will be sponsored next year.
[169.12 → 172.38] So looking ahead, there is a need for ongoing support.
[172.50 → 174.64] Again, that's the offering for next week.
[175.32 → 176.72] As you are viewing this at home,
[176.80 → 179.10] and will be for at least the next two weeks,
[179.98 → 182.54] you can mail a check, drop off a check,
[183.00 → 185.10] make an online contribution at our website,
[185.74 → 187.60] check out the Connections newsletter.
[187.60 → 190.26] Speaking of our newsletter,
[190.72 → 195.08] it wasn't sent to you by email during the course of the last week or so.
[195.20 → 198.38] It was mailed out this time because there are some other attachments
[198.38 → 201.90] that are also involved with the newsletter this time.
[202.34 → 207.08] So edition number 15, probably dated November 15,
[207.08 → 209.48] should have arrived at your home mailbox,
[209.48 → 211.86] or it will very soon.
[216.66 → 218.44] Our call to worship this morning
[218.44 → 223.86] is a litany based on Psalm 27 and John 4, 23.
[223.86 → 231.94] Let us worship God, our light and our salvation.
[233.26 → 236.30] The Lord is the stronghold of our lives.
[236.98 → 239.28] We desire to live in God's house
[239.28 → 241.52] and to seek God in his holy temple.
[242.58 → 245.16] We have come with shouts of joy
[245.16 → 248.22] to sing and to make music to the Lord.
[248.98 → 252.18] Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[252.18 → 257.16] Teach us your ways and make straight our paths
[257.16 → 260.48] in this hour of worship and always.
[262.74 → 266.78] The Lord's greeting comes from selected verses from Psalm 50.
[268.14 → 271.40] The mighty one, God, the Lord,
[271.90 → 273.44] speaks and summons the earth
[273.44 → 276.04] from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
[276.72 → 280.02] From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
[280.02 → 283.26] Our God comes and will not be silent.
[284.32 → 286.62] He summons the heavens above and the earth
[286.62 → 288.46] that he may judge his people.
[289.36 → 291.90] Listen, my people, and I will speak.
[292.52 → 294.78] I am God, your God.
[297.34 → 299.52] Call on me in the day of trouble.
[299.90 → 302.90] I will deliver you, and you will honour me.
[302.90 → 306.68] With that as a welcome from our Lord,
[306.96 → 309.32] let's sing several songs of praises,
[309.76 → 312.10] beginning with Across the Lands.
[312.10 → 314.24] control over us.
[314.66 → 316.54] Hold on.
[316.54 → 318.42] Let's sing Wallace.
[318.42 → 319.42] Amen.
[348.42 → 349.42] Amen.
[378.42 → 379.42] Amen.
[408.42 → 409.42] Amen.
[438.42 → 439.42] Amen.
[468.42 → 469.42] Amen.
[498.42 → 499.42] Amen.
[528.42 → 529.42] Amen.
[558.42 → 559.42] Amen.
[588.42 → 590.42] Amen.
[600.42 → 602.42] Amen.
[618.42 → 625.88] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
[631.88 → 644.88] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
[644.88 → 650.88] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
[674.88 → 676.88] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
[676.88 → 679.88] Alleluia, alleluia.
[679.88 → 682.78] in a recent political speech down in the U.S.
[683.62 → 684.74] We're going to sing it this morning,
[685.22 → 688.00] and I encourage you to sing along with the refrain
[688.00 → 689.20] because it's quite familiar.
[689.70 → 692.88] The verses, which are drawn directly from Psalm 91,
[693.84 → 696.22] also you are welcome to sing along,
[696.28 → 697.82] but may be less familiar with you.
[698.58 → 702.06] So let's sing this morning on Eagle's Wings.
[709.88 → 739.86] Eagle's Wings
[739.88 → 748.00] You who dwell in the shelter of the land
[748.00 → 753.52] and by me each set off the night
[753.52 → 758.88] Say to the Lord my refuge
[758.88 → 764.68] I write in the world of Christ
[764.68 → 770.80] Raise your heart and heed those fears
[770.80 → 777.06] Bear your own breath of love
[777.06 → 782.08] Make it to shine like the sun
[782.08 → 790.20] And hold you in the power of his death
[790.20 → 799.08] The spear of the fellow will never capture you
[799.08 → 805.20] And famine will bring you no fear
[805.20 → 810.74] The glory swings your refuge
[810.74 → 816.08] He has faithfulness your shield
[816.20 → 819.20] Raise you up
[819.20 → 825.32] He must make it to bear your heart
[825.32 → 828.32] The breath of God
[828.32 → 833.32] Make it to shine like the sun
[833.32 → 841.32] And hold you in the power of his death
[841.32 → 847.44] Raise your heart
[847.44 → 849.44] In the fear of the terror
[849.44 → 850.74] The terror of the night
[850.74 → 856.22] The error of flight I gave
[856.22 → 859.44] Though thousands fall
[859.44 → 865.56] Be the fear of his death
[865.56 → 867.56] The fear of his death
[867.56 → 869.56] And he must be in the power of his death
[869.56 → 871.56] And he must be in the power of his death
[871.56 → 879.68] He must be in the power of his death
[879.68 → 884.68] Make it to shine like the sun
[884.68 → 892.68] And hold you in the power of his death
[892.68 → 901.98] For to his angels he's given a command
[901.98 → 907.50] To guard you in all of your ways
[907.50 → 913.06] And hold them as they will pay you up
[913.06 → 916.92] Lest you cash your food and make it so
[916.92 → 946.90] Lest you cash your food and make it so
[946.92 → 976.90] Lest you cash your food and make it so
[976.90 → 981.30] I encourage you to read Psalm 91 sometime today
[981.30 → 984.40] And reflect on those beautiful words again
[984.40 → 990.78] For our time of confession and assurance this morning
[990.78 → 994.82] I have chosen again to read the Ten Commandments
[994.82 → 1000.74] Its very existence and the multiple thou shalt not
[1000.74 → 1002.26] Indicate the obvious
[1002.26 → 1003.40] We are not perfect
[1003.40 → 1007.16] We do not always do what God requires of us
[1007.16 → 1009.78] We are in need of God's mercy
[1009.78 → 1012.46] I'm going to blend this morning
[1012.46 → 1014.66] And with the help of Harry and Tony
[1014.66 → 1018.00] We're going to read the traditional Ten Commandments
[1018.00 → 1021.92] But followed then by a more modern updated version
[1021.92 → 1024.90] Of the Ten Commandments in each case
[1024.90 → 1027.84] We seldom cast golden calves
[1027.84 → 1030.90] And we seldom wish we had our neighbour's ox
[1030.90 → 1034.12] But there are many updated versions
[1034.12 → 1036.20] That we can reflect on this morning
[1036.20 → 1038.62] I'll begin by reading the traditional
[1038.62 → 1040.46] Straight out of King James
[1040.46 → 1042.30] At least the key phrase
[1042.30 → 1047.18] I am the Lord thy God
[1047.18 → 1050.60] Do not worship any other God
[1050.60 → 1052.28] Than the one true God
[1052.28 → 1054.34] All other gods are false gods
[1054.34 → 1056.44] Worship God alone
[1056.44 → 1060.46] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1060.46 → 1062.92] And thou shalt not make unto thee
[1062.92 → 1064.48] Any graven image
[1064.48 → 1069.56] Do not make idols or images in the form of God
[1069.56 → 1073.78] An idol can be anything or anyone you worship
[1073.78 → 1076.42] By making it more important than God
[1076.42 → 1082.28] If something or someone has your time, attention, and affections
[1082.28 → 1083.86] It has your worship
[1083.86 → 1086.78] It could be an idol in your life
[1086.78 → 1091.18] Don't let anything take the place of God in your life
[1091.18 → 1097.12] Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
[1097.12 → 1102.16] Do not treat God's name lightly or with disrespect
[1102.16 → 1104.30] Because of God's importance
[1104.30 → 1107.84] His name is always to be spoken of reverently and with honour
[1107.84 → 1110.70] Always honour God with your words
[1110.70 → 1114.22] Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[1114.22 → 1119.20] Dedicate or set aside a regular day each week
[1119.20 → 1121.62] For rest and worship of the Lord
[1121.62 → 1125.44] Honour thy father and thy mother
[1125.44 → 1128.84] Give honour to your father and mother
[1128.84 → 1131.74] By treating them with respect and obedience
[1131.74 → 1134.60] Thou shalt not murder
[1134.60 → 1139.58] Do not deliberately kill a fellow human being
[1139.58 → 1144.42] Don't hate people or hurt them with words and actions
[1144.42 → 1147.52] Thou shalt not commit adultery
[1147.52 → 1152.96] Do not have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse
[1152.96 → 1156.60] God forbids sex outside the bounds of marriage
[1156.60 → 1160.06] Respect your body and other people's bodies
[1160.06 → 1162.50] Thou shalt not steal
[1162.50 → 1167.80] Do not steal or take anything that doesn't belong to you
[1167.80 → 1170.98] Unless you have been given permission to do so
[1170.98 → 1175.86] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
[1175.86 → 1180.00] Do not tell a lie about someone
[1180.00 → 1183.38] Or bring a false accusation against another person
[1183.38 → 1185.36] Always tell the truth
[1185.36 → 1188.72] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house
[1188.72 → 1190.42] Thy neighbour's wife
[1190.42 → 1191.92] His slaves
[1191.92 → 1192.82] Animals
[1192.82 → 1195.46] Or anything else that is thy neighbour's
[1195.46 → 1199.26] Do not desire anything or anyone
[1199.26 → 1200.96] That does not belong to you
[1200.96 → 1203.50] Comparing yourself to others
[1203.50 → 1205.98] And longing to have what they have
[1205.98 → 1207.64] Can lead to jealousy
[1207.64 → 1208.70] Envy
[1208.70 → 1209.76] And other sins
[1209.76 → 1214.90] Be content by focusing on the blessings God has given you
[1214.90 → 1217.72] And not what he has not given you
[1217.72 → 1221.62] Be thankful for what God has given you
[1221.62 → 1226.12] The paraphrase was written by a woman named Mary Fairchild
[1226.12 → 1229.50] In thinking of God's summary of the law
[1229.50 → 1232.94] We do admit at times we have not loved the Lord our God
[1232.94 → 1233.68] With all our hearts
[1233.68 → 1234.72] Our souls
[1234.72 → 1236.20] And with all our minds
[1236.20 → 1239.02] And we have not always loved our neighbour as ourselves
[1239.02 → 1242.72] We have not always obeyed God's law
[1242.72 → 1247.16] But we have an assurance of God's grace
[1247.16 → 1251.02] The first assurance comes from an unlikely place
[1251.02 → 1257.56] Charlie Chaplin lived and earned a living largely by saying
[1257.56 → 1259.40] Absolutely nothing
[1259.40 → 1263.94] He was a star of silent films in the 1920s
[1263.94 → 1266.94] But he lived to be 88 years old
[1266.94 → 1268.76] And in the later years of his life
[1268.76 → 1270.32] He had a few words of wisdom
[1270.32 → 1274.48] To send out to his loyal fans
[1274.48 → 1279.58] And he revealed some of his belief in God by doing so
[1279.58 → 1280.72] He said
[1280.72 → 1282.48] If you see the moon
[1282.48 → 1284.66] You see the beauty of God
[1284.66 → 1287.50] If you see the sun
[1287.50 → 1290.64] You will see the power of God
[1290.64 → 1293.42] If you see a mirror
[1293.42 → 1296.26] You will see God's best creation
[1296.26 → 1297.60] So believe it
[1297.60 → 1300.22] We are all tourists
[1300.22 → 1301.62] God is our travel agent
[1301.62 → 1303.88] Who has already identified our routes
[1303.88 → 1305.00] Our bookings
[1305.00 → 1306.02] And destination
[1306.02 → 1307.90] Trust him
[1307.90 → 1309.26] And enjoy life
[1309.26 → 1311.40] Life is just a journey
[1311.40 → 1312.92] Therefore live today
[1312.92 → 1315.12] Tomorrow may not be
[1315.12 → 1318.00] The apostle Paul
[1318.00 → 1320.96] The apostle Paul was much more pointed in 2 Corinthians 5
[1320.96 → 1322.36] Verses 16 and following
[1322.36 → 1323.92] So from now on
[1323.92 → 1324.24] So from now on
[1324.24 → 1326.96] We regard no one from a worldly point of view
[1326.96 → 1329.68] Though we once regarded Christ in this way
[1329.68 → 1331.18] We do so no longer
[1331.18 → 1334.12] Therefore if anyone is in Christ
[1334.12 → 1336.46] That person is a new creation
[1336.46 → 1338.46] The old has gone
[1338.46 → 1340.00] The new is here
[1340.00 → 1342.08] All this is from God
[1342.08 → 1345.14] Who reconciled us to himself through Christ
[1345.14 → 1347.22] Thanks be to God
[1347.22 → 1350.12] Our song of response
[1350.12 → 1351.44] At this time
[1351.44 → 1351.84] Is
[1351.84 → 1353.36] You are my king
[1353.36 → 1357.70] For your soul
[1357.70 → 1360.24] This is the Awesome
[1360.24 → 1361.06] Sentences
[1361.06 → 1361.92] The devil
[1361.92 → 1362.18] So from now on
[1362.18 → 1381.10] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1381.10 → 1388.40] I'm accepted, who you can live.
[1388.40 → 1393.80] Love, love, and love, your spirit is within me.
[1393.80 → 1400.80] Because he can hide and rose again.
[1400.80 → 1406.80] Amazing love, I'll pray in you.
[1406.80 → 1412.80] And you might be, you would die for me.
[1412.80 → 1418.20] Amazing love, I'll know it's true.
[1418.20 → 1423.20] This is my dream to honour you.
[1423.20 → 1429.20] And all I do, I honour you.
[1429.20 → 1442.60] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1442.60 → 1448.60] I'm accepted, who you can live.
[1448.60 → 1452.00] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1452.00 → 1454.00] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1454.00 → 1456.00] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1456.00 → 1460.00] And you might be, you would die for me.
[1460.00 → 1463.40] I'm forgiven, but you were forsaken.
[1463.40 → 1473.40] And you might be, you would die for me.
[1473.40 → 1475.40] And you might be, you would die for me.
[1475.40 → 1478.40] And you might be, you would die for me.
[1478.40 → 1491.40] It's my joy to honour You, and honour You, and honour You.
[1491.40 → 1519.78] You are my King, You are my King, Jesus, You are my King, Jesus, You are my King.
[1521.40 → 1533.40] Amazing how I would have been, to try and hide your way.
[1533.40 → 1544.40] Amazing how I would have been, to try and hide your way.
[1544.40 → 1560.40] And honour You, and honour You, and honour You.
[1560.40 → 1562.40] Amen.
[1562.40 → 1564.40] Amen.
[1564.40 → 1566.40] Amen.
[1566.40 → 1568.40] Amen.
[1568.40 → 1570.40] Amen.
[1570.40 → 1572.40] Amen.
[1572.40 → 1574.40] Amen.
[1574.40 → 1576.40] Good morning, friends.
[1576.40 → 1582.40] It is very sad to not be here together once again.
[1582.40 → 1588.40] I was really enjoying being able to share God's Word and being here together.
[1588.40 → 1596.40] But before we turn to God's Word this morning, kind of as John said at the beginning, I want
[1596.40 → 1603.40] to kind of remind you of where we are in terms of our preaching ministry here as a church.
[1603.40 → 1609.40] So during the season of Ordinary Time, which began back in June, we've been in a sermon
[1609.40 → 1613.40] series in the Book of Acts called The Church in Movement.
[1613.40 → 1618.40] And we were considering together what does it look like for us to be a church on mission
[1618.40 → 1622.40] in this time and in this place where God has placed us.
[1622.40 → 1629.40] And so we, there are 28 chapters in the Book of Acts, and we made it to chapter 9.
[1629.40 → 1630.40] So that's pretty good.
[1630.40 → 1635.40] And I hope maybe next summer we will continue on as kind of part two to that.
[1635.40 → 1643.40] And so the last two Sundays, Pastor Gary preached from 2 Kings on the prophet Elisha.
[1643.40 → 1651.40] And he gave me an opportunity to work on my final paper for Regent College that I was working on.
[1651.40 → 1657.40] Next week, we will begin a new series for the season of Advent.
[1657.40 → 1659.40] And so what are we going to do today?
[1659.40 → 1667.40] Well, today I thought it would be a great opportunity to talk about something that is always very important
[1667.40 → 1673.40] and very relevant for the Christian life and no matter what time and place that we find ourselves.
[1673.40 → 1676.40] And that is the practice of reading the Bible.
[1676.40 → 1684.40] And just being shaped and formed by the Holy Spirit at work in our lives through the Scriptures,
[1684.40 → 1687.40] through this means of grace.
[1687.40 → 1691.40] You know, and there are lots of places we can look in the Bible that talk about this.
[1691.40 → 1694.40] But one of my favourite is Psalm 1.
[1694.40 → 1697.40] So Psalm 1, and we'll have the words on the screen.
[1697.40 → 1699.40] We'll read it together.
[1699.40 → 1703.40] So please give your attention to the reading of God's Word as I read it.
[1703.40 → 1705.40] Psalm 1.
[1705.40 → 1709.40] Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked
[1709.40 → 1712.40] or stand in the way that sinners take
[1712.40 → 1715.40] or sit in the company of mockers,
[1715.40 → 1718.40] but whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[1718.40 → 1723.40] and who meditates on his law day and night.
[1723.40 → 1724.40] Psalm 1.
[1724.40 → 1730.40] That person is like a tree planted by streams of water
[1730.40 → 1736.40] which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither.
[1736.40 → 1739.40] Whatever they do prospers.
[1739.40 → 1742.40] Not so the wicked.
[1742.40 → 1745.40] They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
[1745.40 → 1748.40] Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment
[1748.40 → 1751.40] nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[1751.40 → 1756.40] For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
[1756.40 → 1761.40] but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
[1761.40 → 1763.40] Friends, this is the Word of the Lord.
[1763.40 → 1765.40] Thanks be to God.
[1765.40 → 1768.40] All right. Let's pray together.
[1768.40 → 1773.40] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this opportunity to worship you.
[1773.40 → 1779.40] Lord, in these circumstances, looking at our screens, our TVs,
[1779.40 → 1782.40] with maybe many distractions around us,
[1782.40 → 1788.40] many distractions in our own hearts as we worry about what life looks like now
[1788.40 → 1790.40] and in greater restrictions.
[1790.40 → 1793.40] But Lord, we pray that you would meet each of us where we are.
[1793.40 → 1800.40] We thank you that we don't have to come to you really through our own efforts,
[1800.40 → 1804.40] but that you in Christ, through your Holy Spirit, come to us.
[1804.40 → 1809.40] And Lord, we need you to come to us, like with your word, with your words of life.
[1809.40 → 1814.40] So Lord, speak to us now, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1814.40 → 1822.40] So when I was a kid, one of the things I loved to do in the summer is go blueberry picking.
[1822.40 → 1829.40] Actually, apple picking was my favourite because you get to climb right into the highest branches of the tree
[1829.40 → 1832.40] and pick the highest most apple.
[1832.40 → 1837.40] But blueberries are actually more delicious to eat, in my opinion.
[1837.40 → 1838.40] So I love fresh berries.
[1838.40 → 1844.40] And one of the things we quickly discovered living overseas in another part of the world, in Taiwan,
[1844.40 → 1847.40] was that they don't have berries.
[1847.40 → 1850.40] You know, they had other amazing fruits.
[1850.40 → 1858.40] So we had mangoes, we had papaya, pomelo, all of these fruits that are native to Asia.
[1858.40 → 1862.40] But we really missed blueberries.
[1862.40 → 1866.40] And so one summer, after living in Taiwan for many years,
[1866.40 → 1869.40] we were able to visit a family in the States.
[1869.40 → 1871.40] And one summer we went to my aunt's house.
[1871.40 → 1874.40] And she has an acreage and kind of little farm.
[1874.40 → 1876.40] And she had her own blueberry bushes.
[1876.40 → 1884.40] And so we were so happy to go and fill our buckets full of blueberries.
[1884.40 → 1887.40] And eat the berries right off the bush.
[1887.40 → 1891.40] And also to be able to share that with our kids for the first time.
[1891.40 → 1896.40] And, you know, one of the things I'd love to kind of say to my kids and tease them,
[1896.40 → 1899.40] in a lot of ways, but in this time it felt very relevant.
[1899.40 → 1904.40] I would say, if you keep eating blueberries, you're going to turn blue.
[1904.40 → 1908.40] You're going to turn into a blueberry.
[1908.40 → 1914.40] And it's actually true that we become what we eat.
[1914.40 → 1915.40] Right?
[1915.40 → 1923.40] Our bodies are continually shedding cells and producing new cells from the food that we eat.
[1923.40 → 1925.40] From the nutrients.
[1925.40 → 1930.40] And so what we eat actually kind of becomes us.
[1930.40 → 1933.40] And it determines our health.
[1933.40 → 1936.40] And it kind of shapes our bodies in that way.
[1936.40 → 1941.40] And the same thing is true in the spiritual life.
[1941.40 → 1950.40] It's true that the spiritual food that we digest, whatever it is, shapes us.
[1950.40 → 1956.40] And changes us and makes us into certain kinds of people.
[1956.40 → 1961.40] With certain habits of mind and actions and virtues in the world.
[1961.40 → 1971.40] You know, Jesus said, we do not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
[1971.40 → 1976.40] So he's making that comparison between physical food that we eat and that we need for life.
[1976.40 → 1982.40] And his word that equally we need for our lives.
[1982.40 → 1983.40] God's word is life.
[1983.40 → 1993.40] And as we feed on God's word, it nourishes us, and it transforms us to become the kind of people that God intends for us to be in Jesus.
[1993.40 → 2000.40] And so what I want to do this morning is just talked about how we are formed by God's word.
[2000.40 → 2006.40] And I want to say that we are formed by God's word that doing so is going to require four different things from us.
[2006.40 → 2008.40] And they kind of build on each other.
[2008.40 → 2011.40] And we see these four things in our text this morning.
[2011.40 → 2019.40] So the first way that we are formed by God's word is by listening to the voice of the word.
[2019.40 → 2021.40] Okay, by listening to the voice of the word.
[2021.40 → 2023.40] And this is where the psalm begins.
[2023.40 → 2024.40] It says,
[2024.40 → 2033.40] Blessed is the one who does not walk in the step of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of scoffers.
[2033.40 → 2037.40] But whose delight is in the law of the Lord.
[2037.40 → 2041.40] And so the psalmist, as we're going to see, sets up these contrasts.
[2041.40 → 2045.40] And there's a contrast here between two kinds of voices.
[2045.40 → 2051.40] So on the one hand, there's the voice that we can call the voice of the world.
[2051.40 → 2063.40] You know, it's a voice that is characterized here by wickedness, by sin, and by scoffing, which is a kind of scornful, dismissive haughtiness.
[2063.40 → 2067.40] And the psalmist says, you can listen to that voice.
[2067.40 → 2071.40] And you can let that voice be the source of your life in the world.
[2071.40 → 2077.40] But on the other hand, there is what you can call the voice of God.
[2077.40 → 2081.40] And what he calls here the law of the Lord.
[2081.40 → 2085.40] And he says that you can let that voice shape you.
[2085.40 → 2089.40] And so that phrase, the law of the Lord, is really important.
[2089.40 → 2096.40] And it's just, it's not a specific reference to the law of God like we read this morning, the Ten Commandments.
[2096.40 → 2102.40] It's actually shorthand for all of God's word to his people.
[2102.40 → 2112.40] Right, he's saying, if you want to be formed by the word, by listening to the voice of God, you have to listen to all of God's word to his people.
[2112.40 → 2117.40] This is a word that starts way back in the Garden of Eden in Genesis.
[2117.40 → 2125.40] It's a word that then was spoken to Abraham, that voice that called Abraham forth to become a new people of God.
[2125.40 → 2132.40] It's a voice that was spoken to Moses, that then passed on to God's people, Israel.
[2132.40 → 2136.40] And the psalmist is saying, this is the word of God.
[2136.40 → 2138.40] And yet, you need to listen to this voice.
[2138.40 → 2143.40] But it's also a word that we see in the New Testament.
[2143.40 → 2152.40] It's a voice that was spoken through Jesus, who the author of Hebrews tells us is God's full and final word.
[2152.40 → 2162.40] So that means that all that Jesus did, all that Jesus taught, and all that was recorded about him in the Gospels,
[2162.40 → 2169.40] and then that was expounded about his teachings in the New Testament letters, this also is the law of the Lord.
[2171.40 → 2178.40] You know, and we see in the Gospel of John, you know, Jesus is talking to the religious leaders of his day, and he says this to them.
[2178.40 → 2181.40] He says, you search the scriptures.
[2181.40 → 2182.40] Right?
[2182.40 → 2183.40] It's kind of a very vivid phrase.
[2183.40 → 2184.40] You search the scriptures.
[2184.40 → 2189.40] You can imagine, like, flipping through or unrolling the scrolls, searching the scriptures,
[2189.40 → 2192.40] because you think that in them, you have eternal life.
[2192.40 → 2193.40] Right?
[2193.40 → 2195.40] We're all looking for life.
[2195.40 → 2202.40] And Jesus says, it is they, the scriptures, that bear witness about me.
[2202.40 → 2207.40] Yet you refuse to come to me, that you may have life.
[2207.40 → 2217.40] And so when the psalmist teaches us to meditate on the law of the Lord, ultimately what it means is to listen to the voice of Jesus.
[2217.40 → 2225.40] And let that be the voice that shapes your life in this world against all the other voices that we can listen to.
[2225.40 → 2236.40] Now, kind of clarification, it's obvious, it's obviously true that we also learn things from the world.
[2236.40 → 2237.40] Right?
[2237.40 → 2239.40] We do and should.
[2239.40 → 2240.40] Right?
[2240.40 → 2248.40] There are people in the world who are not Christians, but because of common grace have a lot to teach us about the world that we live in.
[2248.40 → 2253.40] So don't let this stark contrast in Psalm 1 confuse you.
[2253.40 → 2258.40] But what the psalmist is talking about is that there's a fundamental voice that shapes your life.
[2258.40 → 2265.40] And he's saying that the voice that shapes your life for a Christian is the voice of Jesus.
[2265.40 → 2266.40] Right?
[2266.40 → 2269.40] That's what we should be listening to.
[2269.40 → 2272.40] Now, what do you think about that?
[2272.40 → 2277.40] What do you think about listening to the voice of Jesus?
[2277.40 → 2282.40] You know, and when I think about it, I think that's pretty hard to do.
[2282.40 → 2289.40] Because I know for myself that I have got all kinds of different voices in my mind that are shaping the way I live.
[2289.40 → 2290.40] Right?
[2290.40 → 2293.40] I've got the voices of the culture that are around us.
[2293.40 → 2300.40] All these voices kind of telling us what we should believe, how we should think about the world in all kinds of different ways.
[2300.40 → 2303.40] I've got the voices of my peers.
[2303.40 → 2306.40] I have the voices of things I read online.
[2306.40 → 2313.40] I have the voices from the pride and the shame of my own heart that is telling me things.
[2313.40 → 2314.40] Right?
[2314.40 → 2317.40] And all of these are trying to teach me how to live in this world.
[2317.40 → 2323.40] And I think it's actually really confusing, and it's really hard to know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing.
[2323.40 → 2328.40] But this text tells us that we want to listen to the voice of Jesus.
[2328.40 → 2333.40] And so I want to ask us kind of really practical question this morning.
[2333.40 → 2336.40] And the question is just simply this.
[2336.40 → 2343.40] How much time do you, do I, spend listening to the voice of Jesus?
[2343.40 → 2349.40] You know, especially maybe compared to the amount of time we spend listening to all the other voices.
[2349.40 → 2353.40] You know, maybe on the news or on Facebook or other places.
[2353.40 → 2356.40] And so, how much time do we spend listening to the voice of Jesus?
[2356.40 → 2362.40] You know, like for example, opening the Bible and reading it.
[2362.40 → 2366.40] You know, do we do it, you know, maybe once a month?
[2366.40 → 2370.40] Do we do it weekly or daily?
[2370.40 → 2374.40] Or maybe even as our psalm says, night and day, morning and evening?
[2374.40 → 2378.40] And I think it's worth thinking about this.
[2378.40 → 2385.40] Because all of us, no matter how much we do read the Bible, all of us can grow in this area.
[2385.40 → 2395.40] And because what this psalm is giving us is a vision of a human being, of a person, and of a community,
[2395.40 → 2402.40] whose life is oriented toward the voice of Jesus as we find it in the Bible.
[2402.40 → 2408.40] And if you don't find yourself opening the Bible, then I want to encourage you to begin there.
[2408.40 → 2415.40] Right? That's how we can live into this vision that God gives us, is by first opening that Bible.
[2415.40 → 2422.40] And by reading the words, the law of the Lord, which is the voice of Jesus.
[2422.40 → 2425.40] And, you know, I would love to help you with that.
[2425.40 → 2427.40] We as a church would love to help you.
[2427.40 → 2429.40] That's why I'm talking about this right now.
[2429.40 → 2435.40] We have a cross-training class where we're talking about different practices of reading the word.
[2435.40 → 2437.40] And you can join us on Tuesday.
[2437.40 → 2438.40] We have a couple more classes.
[2438.40 → 2439.40] 7 p.m.
[2439.40 → 2445.40] Now it feels like an advertisement, but 7 p.m. on Tuesday on Zoom, you can join us.
[2445.40 → 2454.40] And as a pastoral team, we're also talking about what are some resources that we can share with the congregation to help you do this.
[2454.40 → 2464.40] Because we're being formed, being formed by the word begins by listening to the voice of Jesus so that we can be changed by that.
[2464.40 → 2468.40] Okay, but it's not just listening to the voice of the word.
[2468.40 → 2470.40] There's also a second part of this.
[2470.40 → 2474.40] And it's also practicing the habits of the word.
[2474.40 → 2478.40] And again, we see this in Psalm 1, verses 1 and 2.
[2478.40 → 2479.40] It says,
[2479.40 → 2496.40] So when we read that, did you notice all the verbs?
[2496.40 → 2499.40] Because there's like a lot of action going on here.
[2499.40 → 2505.40] And this reminds us that the Christian life is not just about the voice that we listen to.
[2505.40 → 2509.40] Right? We're not just a bunch of ears and that's all that it means to be a Christian.
[2509.40 → 2514.40] Rather, it's about the kind of life that we live.
[2514.40 → 2522.40] And again, the psalmist sets up a contrast between two ways of life.
[2522.40 → 2525.40] So on the one hand, we have the practices of the wicked.
[2525.40 → 2532.40] And there are people who have these habits of mind where they're taking in the counsel of the wicked, it says.
[2532.40 → 2540.40] And then they have these habits of action where they stand and walk according to that counsel that they're hearing.
[2540.40 → 2550.40] And then they have these habits of speech that mark these people where they sit in the seat of those who mock.
[2550.40 → 2560.40] So the voice they listen to and believe, which in their case is not the word of God, that is also shaping the way they live.
[2560.40 → 2563.40] And it's describing this way of being.
[2563.40 → 2574.40] There are these habits of mind, the way we think, these habits of action in the world, the words that come out of our mouths, that come from our hearts.
[2574.40 → 2580.40] So all of these things, it then is contrasted with these practices of the word.
[2580.40 → 2582.40] First, there's this new habit of mind.
[2582.40 → 2584.40] Notice this word meditates.
[2584.40 → 2588.40] It talks about meditating on the word.
[2588.40 → 2592.40] And this word for meditate is a kind of cool word.
[2592.40 → 2596.40] In Hebrew, it's Haggai or something like that, Haggai.
[2596.40 → 2606.40] It's the same word that the prophet Isaiah uses to refer to the sounds that a lion makes when it's eating its prey.
[2606.40 → 2614.40] Okay, so kind of put yourself maybe in the position of the lion kind of devouring its prey.
[2614.40 → 2617.40] And if you're a vegetarian, I'm sorry, maybe chew on a carrot.
[2617.40 → 2627.40] But when Christy was in college, she rented a room from a young married couple from the Philippines.
[2627.40 → 2633.40] And this couple had a big Rottweiler dog named Sam.
[2633.40 → 2643.40] And Sam was super friendly, lovely dog, but she was super intimidating because she was so strong and energetic.
[2643.40 → 2645.40] She was so strong and energetic.
[2645.40 → 2649.40] And this couple would buy Sam a bone from the grocery store, right?
[2649.40 → 2651.40] Right from the deli.
[2651.40 → 2654.40] And Sam would love her bone.
[2654.40 → 2658.40] She would play with the bone and wag her tail.
[2658.40 → 2664.40] You know, she would sit all day just kind of gnawing on her bone, sinking her teeth into it, drooling all over it.
[2664.40 → 2668.40] You know, of course, if she wanted you to play fetch, you would have to pick this thing up.
[2668.40 → 2672.40] It's like dripping and, you know, but she would be happy.
[2672.40 → 2677.40] She would bury it in her backyard and then return the next day and dig it up again.
[2677.40 → 2685.40] Psalm 1 is telling us that this blessed person is someone who does all that.
[2685.40 → 2697.40] Someone who meditates or Haggai on the word of God, just kind of gnawing on it and delighting in it and chewing on it, burying it and digging it up and playing with it.
[2697.40 → 2702.40] It's just kind of growling over the word.
[2702.40 → 2712.40] So it gives us this picture, of course, of this kind of really a constant daily attention to God's word, to the voice of Jesus.
[2715.40 → 2719.40] So secondly, though, there's also these habits of heart.
[2719.40 → 2722.40] And did you notice the word delight here?
[2722.40 → 2724.40] Delight is in the law of the Lord.
[2724.40 → 2727.40] And delight, it's about what you love.
[2727.40 → 2733.40] It's about cultivating habits that teach you to love the right things.
[2733.40 → 2737.40] Because, you know, we can love the wrong things.
[2737.40 → 2739.40] We can delight in sin and wickedness.
[2739.40 → 2745.40] And we all have this inclination because of our sinful nature to do that.
[2745.40 → 2754.40] But reading the word forms us into new loves so that we will begin to love the things that God loves.
[2754.40 → 2758.40] But there's also these habits of action as well.
[2758.40 → 2764.40] And so it says, as we listen to God's voice, it leads us to renounce the habits of wickedness.
[2765.40 → 2770.40] And by implication, then, to embrace new kinds of habits and to walk with God.
[2770.40 → 2776.40] Okay, so all in all, you know, we have this vision of a person and of a community that not only listens to the voice of God,
[2776.40 → 2786.40] but also we're allowing that voice to form us in our minds, in our hearts, and in our actions.
[2787.40 → 2796.40] And so when you become a Christian, Jesus kind of comes to us and says, you know, I have saved you.
[2796.40 → 2797.40] You are my child now.
[2797.40 → 2801.40] And if you're going to follow me, it's not just about listening to my voice.
[2801.40 → 2807.40] It's also following in my steps, walking after me, imitating me.
[2808.40 → 2812.40] And so what does it mean for us to practice the habits of the word?
[2813.40 → 2820.40] It means imitating Jesus in our minds, in our hearts, and in our actions.
[2822.40 → 2824.40] Okay, so that's the second one.
[2824.40 → 2827.40] Now, here's the third thing that we see in this passage.
[2827.40 → 2833.40] To be formed by the word, we also need to belong to the community of the word.
[2834.40 → 2840.40] You know, the Bible teaches us that being formed by the word isn't just a matter of doing it on your own.
[2840.40 → 2841.40] Right?
[2841.40 → 2844.40] It's actually a communal life that we have together.
[2844.40 → 2846.40] And we see that in verse 5.
[2846.40 → 2849.40] We see this reference to the community there.
[2849.40 → 2850.40] It says,
[2850.40 → 2855.40] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[2855.40 → 2862.40] And so we have this third contrast between these two kinds of communities.
[2862.40 → 2865.40] On the one hand, you have the community of the wicked.
[2865.40 → 2873.40] So there's this whole community of people that the Bible talks about who are just, you know, we're all sinners.
[2873.40 → 2880.40] But when it's talking about a community of the wicked, it's just talking about people who reject, actively reject God's grace in their lives.
[2880.40 → 2883.40] Right? God's grace, this invitation is for all of us.
[2883.40 → 2889.40] It is by the grace of the Holy Spirit that we can listen and then respond to this grace.
[2889.40 → 2895.40] And it says that there are people who do not respond to that grace.
[2895.40 → 2900.40] And they're rejecting God and not walking in his ways.
[2900.40 → 2903.40] And so you can belong to that kind of community.
[2903.40 → 2908.40] And that will, in turn, shape you in all sorts of ways.
[2908.40 → 2914.40] Or, there's this community called the assembly of the righteous.
[2914.40 → 2922.40] This is about those, not who are perfect, but people who have heard God's voice by grace.
[2922.40 → 2926.40] Who have come to him in their sin.
[2926.40 → 2928.40] Who have embraced God's forgiveness.
[2928.40 → 2933.40] And who are now just trying to live with him in the world.
[2933.40 → 2937.40] And so he's saying that there's a community of God's people.
[2937.40 → 2940.40] And they're called the church.
[2940.40 → 2943.40] They're called the household of God.
[2943.40 → 2946.40] The body of Christ. The temple. All of these things.
[2946.40 → 2954.40] And the psalmist is saying this community is where you are going to learn how to be formed by the word.
[2954.40 → 2957.40] Right? And again, here's another clarification.
[2957.40 → 2960.40] It's not talking about withdrawing from other communities.
[2960.40 → 2964.40] Right? Jesus explicitly tells us not to do that.
[2964.40 → 2967.40] But the question for us is this.
[2967.40 → 2973.40] Is what is the community where you are seeking to become yourself?
[2973.40 → 2980.40] Or, you know, what is the community that you're seeking to really belong to?
[2980.40 → 2982.40] To be accepted by?
[2982.40 → 2986.40] Or what community are you being shaped by?
[2986.40 → 2989.40] In its vision of what life is.
[2989.40 → 2990.40] Its values.
[2990.40 → 2991.40] Its actions.
[2991.40 → 2992.40] All of these things.
[2992.40 → 2994.40] Is it the church?
[2994.40 → 2996.40] Or is it some other community?
[2997.40 → 3003.40] And this is so important because we are strongly influenced by the people we hang out with.
[3003.40 → 3005.40] And spend time with.
[3005.40 → 3007.40] You know, I read somewhere.
[3007.40 → 3016.40] It's like the three or five people you spend the most time with strongly influence the kind of person that you are.
[3016.40 → 3017.40] And the way you live in the world.
[3018.40 → 3021.40] So this is something worth thinking about.
[3021.40 → 3025.40] And again, that doesn't mean we have to spend all of our time, you know, in the church.
[3025.40 → 3027.40] And we can over program things.
[3027.40 → 3029.40] And we can be here, you know, almost seven days a week.
[3029.40 → 3034.40] But even as we live in the world, and we're part of different kinds of communities.
[3034.40 → 3038.40] Where are we looking to shape us?
[3038.40 → 3045.40] And what this psalm is saying is that there is a community that will help you become what God intends for you to be.
[3045.40 → 3047.40] And that is called the church.
[3047.40 → 3052.40] So here's our fourth thing for this morning.
[3052.40 → 3054.40] The fourth thing we see in this passage.
[3054.40 → 3058.40] So how, you know, how are we formed by the word?
[3058.40 → 3060.40] You know, we've said we listen to the voice of the word.
[3060.40 → 3063.40] We practice, secondly, the habits of the word.
[3063.40 → 3065.40] We belong to a community of the word.
[3065.40 → 3073.40] And then also, all of that building on one another leads us to then cultivate the fruits of the word.
[3073.40 → 3081.40] So listen to what the way the psalmist describes the fruit of the word in verses three and four.
[3081.40 → 3096.40] It says, that person, the blessed person, is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season, and whose leaf does not wither.
[3096.40 → 3098.40] Whatever they do, it prospers.
[3098.40 → 3100.40] Not so the wicked.
[3100.40 → 3103.40] They are like the chaff that the wind blows away.
[3103.40 → 3116.40] So the psalm is teaching us that the voice we listen to, the habits we practice, the community we belong to, all of that produces certain kinds of fruit in our lives.
[3116.40 → 3120.40] And again, he contrasts two kinds of fruits.
[3120.40 → 3124.40] On the one hand, you have the fruit of dust and death.
[3124.40 → 3133.40] The sinful and wicked way that we can be, the way that we can live, do you know where it leads?
[3133.40 → 3137.40] The psalmist is telling us that it leads to nothing.
[3137.40 → 3144.40] And he uses this imagery of chaff, and a lot of us are kind of no agriculture.
[3144.40 → 3150.40] And you know that it's the stuff that's left behind after you've gotten out the wheat.
[3150.40 → 3156.40] And so it's weightless, it's useless, it's basically just dust.
[3156.40 → 3164.40] And in verse 6, it says that in the end, this kind of life, the fruit that it produces, just leads to death.
[3165.40 → 3169.40] The wicked will perish, and they will not stand in the judgment.
[3169.40 → 3173.40] And then, so it's contrasted with the fruit of the word.
[3173.40 → 3179.40] In this, the fruit of the word, it gives us this picture of fullness and of flourishing and of life.
[3179.40 → 3181.40] So notice what it says here.
[3181.40 → 3187.40] He talks about a tree that is fruitful and that is growing in the fullness of what it was meant to be.
[3188.40 → 3191.40] It's yielding its fruit.
[3191.40 → 3193.40] Its leaf does not wither.
[3193.40 → 3196.40] It's a healthy tree.
[3196.40 → 3197.40] It's a healthy tree.
[3197.40 → 3205.40] And the image it gives us is this, that just as a tree is planted by a stream and is fed by this flowing water,
[3206.40 → 3211.40] so it is for us as people, when we are planted in the word of God,
[3211.40 → 3219.40] and this word is flowing into us and feeding us and nourishing our souls, what does it do?
[3219.40 → 3222.40] It produces all this kind of fruit in us.
[3222.40 → 3223.40] Right?
[3223.40 → 3227.40] So the tree isn't just a channel to move water from one place to another,
[3227.40 → 3231.40] but it's this living organism, and it absorbs that water,
[3231.40 → 3236.40] and it's changed to produce something new and delightful.
[3236.40 → 3240.40] And just like us, you know, when we're reading the Bible, it's not just to,
[3240.40 → 3245.40] we're not just reading these words, but we're absorbing the life.
[3245.40 → 3249.40] We're being nourished by God's word because of the Holy Spirit.
[3249.40 → 3251.40] This is a different kind of book.
[3251.40 → 3252.40] It's a spiritual book.
[3252.40 → 3255.40] The Holy Spirit uses it to form us.
[3255.40 → 3260.40] And in doing that, it produces fruit in our lives.
[3260.40 → 3263.40] And that is the life that we have in Jesus.
[3263.40 → 3264.40] Right?
[3264.40 → 3268.40] That's the life that he offers to anyone who trusts in him,
[3268.40 → 3275.40] that we can turn away from listening to these voices that lead us to ways of wickedness
[3275.40 → 3279.40] wickedness and communities that teach us wickedness,
[3279.40 → 3281.40] then producing stuff that leads to death.
[3281.40 → 3282.40] Right?
[3282.40 → 3284.40] That's all the contrast on one end.
[3284.40 → 3287.40] Or we can listen to the voice of Jesus.
[3287.40 → 3292.40] We can then let that form us into practicing the ways of Jesus,
[3292.40 → 3295.40] being part of a community that helps us do that.
[3295.40 → 3300.40] And when we do that, we produce things in our lives where we can look at it and say,
[3300.40 → 3304.40] this isn't from me, but this is from God, the Holy Spirit in me.
[3304.40 → 3307.40] And so that's my prayer for us as a church.
[3307.40 → 3311.40] And friends, we need to be a church that meditates on the word of God.
[3311.40 → 3313.40] That's the most important thing.
[3313.40 → 3322.40] That we would be transformed by it and that it would produce beautiful fruit in us for God's glory and for the good of the world.
[3322.40 → 3326.40] And so let me pray that God would do that, that he would do that in us.
[3326.40 → 3327.40] So let's pray together.
[3327.40 → 3335.40] Father, we ask that you would help us because we struggle.
[3335.40 → 3336.40] I struggle.
[3336.40 → 3343.40] All of us do when, Lord, we are attracted to other voices.
[3343.40 → 3345.40] They're more exciting sometimes.
[3345.40 → 3351.40] They're, um, make us feel good about ourselves in different ways.
[3351.40 → 3355.40] Like we know something or we, we belong in, to some group.
[3355.40 → 3359.40] But Lord, we, Lord, we know that your word is life.
[3359.40 → 3363.40] And so, Lord, we pray that you, by your spirit, you would help us to listen to your word
[3363.40 → 3367.40] and that you would help us to form habits of reading your word.
[3367.40 → 3372.40] Lord, and every time we do, Lord, would you speak to us, and would you bless us in it?
[3372.40 → 3374.40] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3374.40 → 3375.40] Amen.
[3375.40 → 3376.40] All right.
[3376.40 → 3378.40] So let us sing our song of response.
[3378.40 → 3380.40] All right.
[3380.40 → 3382.40] So let us sing our song of response.
[3382.40 → 3403.40] .
[3403.40 → 3404.40] Let the weak say I am strong.
[3404.40 → 3408.40] Let the poor say I am rich.
[3408.40 → 3409.40] Let the blind say I can see.
[3409.40 → 3410.40] Let the blind say I can see.
[3410.40 → 3411.40] It's what the Lord has made me.
[3411.40 → 3425.40] Let the blind say I can see.
[3425.40 → 3442.40] The weak say I'm strong, and the poor say I am rich, and the blind say I can see, it's what the Lord has done to me.
[3442.40 → 3470.40] Hosanna, Hosanna to the Lamb that was slain, Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and rose made.
[3472.40 → 3472.94] 
[3502.40 → 3515.62] The Lamb that was slain, Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.
[3515.62 → 3531.60] The Lamb that was from the waters deep into the sailing waters of love,
[3531.60 → 3541.46] I will sing salvation songs, Jesus Christ has set me free.
[3541.46 → 3559.38] Hosanna, Hosanna, to the Lamb that was slain, Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.
[3559.38 → 3569.18] Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.
[3569.18 → 3578.38] Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.
[3578.38 → 3608.36] Hosanna, Hosanna, to the Lord.
[3609.06 → 3615.68] So would you please join me as we go to the Lord in a prayer of supplication,
[3615.78 → 3619.30] praying for our church community, praying for our city and our world.
[3619.72 → 3620.94] There are so many things to pray for.
[3621.16 → 3621.86] Let's pray together.
[3621.86 → 3625.92] Father, we come to you.
[3626.92 → 3627.78] I do.
[3627.94 → 3629.02] I think all of us do.
[3629.34 → 3629.60] Weary.
[3631.18 → 3633.80] We come to you frustrated.
[3635.38 → 3638.42] We come to you done with COVID.
[3638.42 → 3648.52] Father, we grieve the loss after loss and the toll that this is taking on us as a congregation,
[3649.52 → 3653.98] on our city, on our nation, on our country, on our world.
[3653.98 → 3664.96] Father, we come to you and pray for mercy, not because we deserve it, but because you are a God who delights to be merciful.
[3664.96 → 3669.18] We ask that you would lift this off of us.
[3669.46 → 3672.52] Lord, bring an end to this pandemic, we pray.
[3672.52 → 3679.40] And as we wait for a vaccine, would you help the people and the companies who are working to deliver a vaccine swiftly.
[3680.20 → 3685.92] We ask that our world, Lord, would be freed from the grip of this virus soon.
[3685.92 → 3691.42] Father, we pray that you would be with those who are sick with this disease.
[3691.96 → 3694.66] Would you comfort them with the comfort only you can give.
[3695.60 → 3700.42] And Lord, use this terrible disease even to draw people to yourself.
[3702.58 → 3711.58] And Father, we pray for those who are struggling with isolation, with loneliness, with fear and anxiety.
[3712.56 → 3714.66] Father, we pray that you would have mercy.
[3714.66 → 3717.84] And as your people, Lord, sustain us.
[3718.84 → 3728.72] And as we seek to be sustained by you, then give us energy and creativity to reach out to others around us.
[3729.24 → 3734.48] Even with simple gestures of care and concern and connection.
[3735.60 → 3743.50] Lord, help us to sustain one another and to reach out and maybe resist just retreating into our own private worlds.
[3743.50 → 3749.54] Father, we pray for our leaders in government and in health care.
[3750.00 → 3751.22] Lord, give them wisdom.
[3751.88 → 3755.10] And knowing how to lead us forward, this has been an exhausting season.
[3755.68 → 3760.00] Not only for us individually, but for those who have responsibility to lead us.
[3760.80 → 3763.12] Lord, would you give them your grace and wisdom.
[3763.12 → 3767.20] And Lord, also we think about our own church family.
[3767.34 → 3769.70] And there are many needs that we have among us.
[3770.24 → 3776.82] Father, we pray for John and BEV as John's dad passed away at home in Smothers at the age of 97.
[3777.68 → 3780.74] We praise you and honour you that he is with you now.
[3780.74 → 3785.56] Be with John's mom and family that he leaves behind.
[3786.22 → 3789.30] Have mercy on them and may they take comfort in you.
[3789.90 → 3791.10] And would you encourage them.
[3792.06 → 3800.54] Likewise, Father, we pray for family and friends of Michelle But, a former member of our church, who also passed away this week.
[3801.24 → 3804.74] And Lord, would you bind up the wounds of all those who mourn.
[3804.74 → 3809.40] We pray also for those who are sick.
[3809.86 → 3817.92] And Lord, there are many people struggling and suffering with many kind of health problems right now.
[3818.02 → 3823.22] But Lord, just this morning we lift to Pastor Henry and Kathy who are in hospice.
[3824.00 → 3826.56] Lord, would you put your healing hand upon them.
[3827.20 → 3834.32] And Lord, we pray that as the healer, the creator who made their bodies and who fashions us together,
[3834.74 → 3836.64] that you would bring healing to them.
[3838.30 → 3841.88] Finally, Father, remind us of the hope that we have in Jesus.
[3842.64 → 3845.10] And give us eyes to see all that you are doing.
[3845.14 → 3850.42] Rather than thinking and speaking as though we don't really believe that Jesus has overcome the world.
[3851.18 → 3860.04] Let us instead live boldly in the reality that Jesus has prevailed and will surely return to reign forever and ever.
[3861.34 → 3864.60] Lord, our perspectives are so narrow and dim.
[3865.74 → 3870.14] We can only see what is happening in front of us.
[3870.30 → 3871.82] We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
