• God works all things according to his plan and purpose
• The gospel was spread through the persecution of Christians in Jerusalem
• Non-apostle leaders, including merchants, farmers, and craftsmen, were scattered to other areas where they preached the word of Jesus Christ
• They did not do this out of a sense of mission or courage, but rather because they were fleeing for their lives
• The scattered individuals unintentionally planted seeds of faith wherever they went, resulting in the spread of the gospel
• This principle is still relevant today, as believers are also being "scattered" to different areas where they can share the gospel and grow in their faith

• Sending of the Spirit: Peter and John are sent from Jerusalem to Samaria after hearing about the Samaritans accepting God's word
• Delay between baptism and receiving the Holy Spirit in Acts 8:14-17
• The passage has been a source of disagreement over almost 100 years, used to support the idea of a "two-fold conversion" (baptism and baptism of the Spirit)
• The Holy Spirit is given uniquely when the Gospel crosses racial or ethnic divides.
• This occurs three times in Acts: at Pentecost, to the Samaritans, and to Cornelius and the Gentiles.
• Each time, it's clear that the Spirit wants to include those previously seen as impure or unclean.
• The emphasis is on unity of the church, breaking down barriers and divisions.
