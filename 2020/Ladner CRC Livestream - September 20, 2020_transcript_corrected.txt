[1139.62 → 1169.60] Thank you.
[1169.60 → 1199.60] Thank you.
[1199.60 → 1229.58] And again, I will, you know,
[1229.58 → 1259.56] We have to say,
[1259.56 → 1289.54] And by the power of your God,
[1289.54 → 1319.52] Amen.
[1319.52 → 1349.50] So let's continue to sing,
[1349.50 → 1379.48] You are my home.
[1379.48 → 1409.46] Your promise, your promise,
[1409.46 → 1439.44] Thank you.
[1439.44 → 1447.08] Come rescue me, O Lord
[1447.08 → 1449.28] You are my hope
[1449.28 → 1455.58] Your promise never fails me
[1455.58 → 1463.22] And my desire is to follow you forever
[1463.22 → 1468.08] For you are good, for you are good
[1468.08 → 1472.44] For you are good to me
[1472.44 → 1476.70] For you are good, for you are good
[1476.70 → 1481.00] For you are good to me
[1498.08 → 1500.62] God is good to us
[1500.62 → 1509.02] So together we have been looking at the New Testament book of Acts
[1509.02 → 1513.52] And Acts tells the story of the early church
[1513.52 → 1518.94] This group of people who trusted in Jesus
[1518.94 → 1521.70] And they sought to follow Jesus as their saviour
[1521.70 → 1525.68] And it's the story of what the spirit of God did in them
[1525.68 → 1529.28] And then through them and how it changed the entire world
[1529.28 → 1534.82] And one thing we've been seeing is that the early church is embracing Jesus
[1534.82 → 1538.32] They're embracing a new way of relating to God
[1538.32 → 1540.94] Which is a way of relating to God by grace
[1540.94 → 1545.46] And they're embracing a new way of life
[1545.46 → 1552.06] And it's a way of life that cuts against the way that anybody had ever lived
[1552.06 → 1555.56] And so as we continue through Acts
[1555.56 → 1557.40] We've come to Acts chapter 6
[1557.40 → 1559.60] We'll be reading verses 1-7
[1559.60 → 1561.30] And as I was preparing this
[1561.30 → 1562.76] I'm like, oh, this is kind of familiar
[1562.76 → 1568.62] So actually I realized this is the very first sermon I preached in this church
[1568.62 → 1570.74] As a guest back in 2017
[1570.74 → 1572.50] So I was like, oh no
[1572.50 → 1574.70] So I rewrote it
[1574.70 → 1577.84] Totally different, you know, perspective
[1577.84 → 1580.80] And the message I want to share with you today
[1580.80 → 1582.56] Just in case you remember
[1582.56 → 1585.12] Which I didn't, partly
[1585.12 → 1588.14] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word
[1588.14 → 1590.00] Acts chapter 6
[1590.00 → 1593.94] In those days when the number of disciples was increasing
[1593.94 → 1597.86] The Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews
[1597.86 → 1601.94] Because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food
[1601.94 → 1606.92] So the twelve gathered all the disciples together and said
[1606.92 → 1612.00] It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God
[1612.00 → 1614.16] In order to wait on tables
[1614.16 → 1619.12] Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you
[1619.12 → 1621.76] Who are known to be full of the spirit and wisdom
[1621.76 → 1625.38] We will turn this responsibility over to them
[1625.38 → 1628.20] And will give our attention to prayer
[1628.20 → 1630.18] And the ministry of the word
[1630.18 → 1633.38] This proposal pleased the whole group
[1633.38 → 1636.22] They chose Stephen, a man full of faith
[1636.22 → 1637.66] And of the Holy Spirit
[1637.66 → 1645.52] Also Philip, Prochorus, Picador, Timon, Parents, and Nicholas from Antioch
[1645.52 → 1647.18] A convert to Judaism
[1647.18 → 1651.24] They presented these men to the apostles
[1651.24 → 1654.24] Who prayed and laid their hands on them
[1654.24 → 1656.62] So the word of God spread
[1656.62 → 1659.94] The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly
[1659.94 → 1664.18] And many priests became obedient to the faith
[1664.18 → 1666.36] This is the word of the Lord
[1666.36 → 1668.36] Thanks be to God
[1668.36 → 1669.44] Let's pray together
[1669.44 → 1672.70] Holy Spirit
[1672.70 → 1677.62] Holy Spirit who we read was so present and powerful and working
[1677.62 → 1679.90] Among the early church
[1679.90 → 1683.22] Lord we desire that you would be present with us in the same way
[1683.22 → 1686.28] That you would empower us
[1686.28 → 1687.84] Latin or CRC
[1687.84 → 1689.16] Each one of us individually
[1689.16 → 1692.04] Lord that we would be able to follow you
[1692.04 → 1694.10] Trust in you with our whole lives
[1694.10 → 1696.92] And hear your word and your voice
[1696.92 → 1698.64] And so Lord we come to you
[1698.64 → 1700.58] As we do to your word
[1700.58 → 1701.88] Which is living and active
[1701.88 → 1703.54] And by your spirit
[1703.54 → 1706.70] Is able to open our eyes
[1706.70 → 1709.10] To show us who you are
[1709.10 → 1709.96] Who we are
[1709.96 → 1712.12] And Lord what it means to follow you
[1712.12 → 1714.14] So this morning Lord do your work
[1714.14 → 1715.38] With your word
[1715.38 → 1716.56] In our hearts
[1716.56 → 1717.76] We pray in Jesus name
[1717.76 → 1718.48] Amen
[1718.48 → 1723.72] So studying the early church is fascinating
[1723.72 → 1725.02] I'm reading a book called
[1725.02 → 1727.08] The Patient Ferment of the Early Church
[1727.08 → 1728.52] Which is a very
[1728.52 → 1731.08] Lots of things I'd love to share with you
[1731.08 → 1733.52] But one story I read from that
[1733.52 → 1735.06] Kind of struck out to me
[1735.06 → 1737.52] And it's a story that comes down to us
[1737.52 → 1738.60] From the 4th century
[1738.60 → 1742.98] And so early in the reign of Emperor Constantine
[1742.98 → 1746.92] You know the Roman legions would send out gangs of troops
[1746.92 → 1748.70] And they would go all over the Roman Empire
[1748.70 → 1751.18] And they would round people up
[1751.18 → 1753.64] They would actually abduct peasants
[1753.64 → 1755.22] From the various villages
[1755.22 → 1760.86] To force them to enlist in the military
[1760.86 → 1766.82] And so there's one man named Comics
[1766.82 → 1770.00] And his story we know it has come down to us
[1770.00 → 1773.34] So he was captured in North Africa, Upper Egypt
[1773.34 → 1776.16] And then he was shipped down the Nile River
[1776.16 → 1779.06] And so the boat carrying these prisoners
[1779.06 → 1780.08] Down the Nile River
[1780.08 → 1782.50] Sailed down and docked in a city called Thebes
[1782.50 → 1784.80] And as they docked in these cities
[1784.80 → 1786.02] They unload all the prisoners
[1786.02 → 1787.74] And they put them in the local jail
[1787.74 → 1788.76] So they can't run away
[1788.76 → 1791.54] And so already you know
[1791.54 → 1792.60] This is the 4th century
[1792.60 → 1794.36] It's been some time
[1794.36 → 1796.44] Christianity is spreading around the Roman Empire
[1796.44 → 1797.62] Even into North Africa
[1797.62 → 1799.36] And so there were some Christians
[1799.36 → 1800.64] Living in Thebes, the city
[1800.64 → 1802.76] And they heard of these prisoners
[1802.76 → 1804.60] And their situation
[1804.60 → 1805.98] And their hearts went out to them
[1805.98 → 1807.62] And so these Christians
[1807.62 → 1809.74] They prepared food and water
[1809.74 → 1811.90] And brought them to the prison
[1811.90 → 1814.06] To care for these prisoners
[1814.06 → 1815.26] Who needed help
[1815.26 → 1818.28] And so Comics
[1818.28 → 1821.28] You know received the food
[1821.28 → 1822.24] He was so touched
[1822.24 → 1823.28] And he asked
[1823.28 → 1826.28] Who are these people bringing us help?
[1826.32 → 1827.74] Who would do this?
[1827.78 → 1828.58] This is unheard of
[1828.58 → 1831.40] And so a local person told him
[1831.40 → 1833.02] It was the Christians
[1833.02 → 1834.14] So he said
[1834.14 → 1835.38] What's a Christian?
[1835.90 → 1836.70] Who are these people?
[1837.66 → 1839.58] And his informant replied
[1839.58 → 1841.64] They are people
[1841.64 → 1843.70] Who bear the name of Christ
[1843.70 → 1844.68] The Son of God
[1844.68 → 1846.80] And they do good to everyone
[1846.80 → 1848.70] Putting their hope in him
[1848.70 → 1850.36] Who made heaven and earth
[1850.36 → 1851.56] And us people
[1851.56 → 1854.12] And according to the account
[1854.12 → 1855.64] Comics' heart
[1855.64 → 1856.10] It says
[1856.10 → 1857.54] Was set on fire
[1857.54 → 1859.16] That's what happens to us
[1859.16 → 1860.94] When the Holy Spirit comes
[1860.94 → 1862.64] And enters our lives
[1862.64 → 1863.54] And we're regenerated
[1863.54 → 1865.76] And he converted to Christianity
[1865.76 → 1867.94] And eventually he was able to
[1867.94 → 1869.56] Kind of get free
[1869.56 → 1871.58] Of this enslavement
[1871.58 → 1872.68] And he later became
[1872.68 → 1874.08] A leader in the church
[1874.08 → 1876.90] And so friends
[1876.90 → 1878.26] The reason I'm sharing this with you
[1878.26 → 1879.56] Is that I think it's a picture
[1879.56 → 1880.54] Of the generosity
[1880.54 → 1881.82] Of the early church
[1881.82 → 1883.34] And it's a picture
[1883.34 → 1884.58] That we also see reflected
[1884.58 → 1886.00] In our passage this morning
[1886.00 → 1887.18] One of the ways
[1887.18 → 1888.50] The gospel transformed
[1888.50 → 1889.40] The early church
[1889.40 → 1891.16] Is that it made them
[1891.16 → 1892.90] Into a generous community
[1892.90 → 1893.80] Right?
[1893.84 → 1895.44] It took these ordinary people
[1895.44 → 1896.44] Ordinary people
[1896.44 → 1897.10] Who are also
[1897.10 → 1897.96] Kind of just shaped
[1897.96 → 1899.38] By their own culture
[1899.38 → 1900.12] And society
[1900.12 → 1900.80] Men and women
[1900.80 → 1902.66] And it made them
[1902.66 → 1904.30] Into bold
[1904.30 → 1906.04] Compassionate people
[1906.04 → 1907.76] Who would care with others
[1907.76 → 1909.56] With this extraordinary boldness
[1909.56 → 1910.96] Unconcerned for themselves
[1910.96 → 1912.46] Where they
[1912.46 → 1913.58] The Christians would welcome
[1913.58 → 1913.98] Welcome
[1913.98 → 1916.12] And show compassion
[1916.12 → 1918.80] To the most vulnerable
[1918.80 → 1922.20] And this was in sharp contrast
[1922.20 → 1924.62] To the often brutal
[1924.62 → 1926.12] And indifferent world
[1926.12 → 1927.08] That they lived in
[1927.08 → 1928.82] So this morning
[1928.82 → 1930.06] I want us to look at this
[1930.06 → 1931.92] Movement of generous community
[1931.92 → 1934.30] That we see in the early church
[1934.30 → 1935.74] And then for us to kind of
[1935.74 → 1936.96] Just reflect and consider
[1936.96 → 1939.08] What it might look like for us
[1939.08 → 1941.48] To be a community like this
[1941.48 → 1943.30] One thing we're going to see
[1943.30 → 1944.90] Is that we have these
[1944.90 → 1946.50] Hellenistic and Hebraic Jews
[1946.50 → 1947.32] And so already
[1947.32 → 1948.38] There was an issue
[1948.38 → 1949.52] Of culture
[1949.52 → 1950.84] And linguistic differences
[1950.84 → 1953.18] And as we as a church
[1953.18 → 1954.82] We are reaching out
[1954.82 → 1956.46] To our Chinese neighbours
[1956.46 → 1957.18] Around us
[1957.18 → 1959.06] We are inviting new immigrants
[1959.06 → 1960.02] To come and be a part
[1960.02 → 1960.70] Of this family
[1960.70 → 1961.92] We too
[1961.92 → 1963.14] Will continue
[1963.14 → 1964.64] And probably increasingly
[1964.64 → 1966.58] Experience what they're experiencing
[1966.58 → 1967.70] Which is kind of
[1967.70 → 1969.58] A cultural and linguistic challenge
[1969.58 → 1971.04] That comes when trying
[1971.04 → 1971.82] To live together
[1971.82 → 1972.52] As one people
[1972.52 → 1973.40] And, so I think
[1973.40 → 1974.56] This is timely for us
[1974.56 → 1975.98] And that we can learn from it
[1975.98 → 1977.70] So there are two things
[1977.70 → 1978.44] I want to draw out
[1978.44 → 1979.62] From this text
[1979.62 → 1981.38] And share with you this morning
[1981.38 → 1983.70] And I want us to look at first
[1983.70 → 1984.82] Just their life together
[1984.82 → 1985.90] What that looks like
[1985.90 → 1986.96] And then secondly
[1986.96 → 1988.50] Something that they share together
[1988.50 → 1989.24] Okay
[1989.24 → 1990.02] Their life together
[1990.02 → 1991.50] And something that they share together
[1991.50 → 1993.52] And so first
[1993.52 → 1994.34] Their life together
[1994.34 → 1995.66] And if you look at verse 1
[1995.66 → 1997.30] What we're seeing
[1997.30 → 1999.08] Is that very early on
[1999.08 → 2000.58] In the community of the church
[2000.58 → 2002.22] There were apparently
[2002.22 → 2004.30] So many widows
[2004.30 → 2006.14] In this community
[2006.14 → 2007.66] That they had to develop
[2007.66 → 2008.82] A system
[2008.82 → 2010.80] To distribute food
[2010.80 → 2011.88] To all of them
[2011.88 → 2012.96] And not only that
[2012.96 → 2014.88] It had to be a daily distribution
[2014.88 → 2016.02] So this is like
[2016.02 → 2017.28] A major operation
[2017.28 → 2019.30] And it's a grassroots operation
[2019.30 → 2020.16] That's happening here
[2020.16 → 2021.74] So if you look at verse 1
[2021.74 → 2022.28] It says
[2022.28 → 2023.60] In those days
[2023.60 → 2024.84] When the number of disciples
[2024.84 → 2025.82] Was increasing
[2025.82 → 2027.76] The Hellenistic Jews
[2027.76 → 2028.54] Among them
[2028.54 → 2029.74] Complained against
[2029.74 → 2030.68] The Hebraic Jews
[2030.68 → 2031.62] And we'll look at that later
[2031.62 → 2033.50] Because their widows
[2033.50 → 2034.44] Were being overlooked
[2034.44 → 2036.66] In the daily distribution
[2036.66 → 2037.40] Of food
[2037.40 → 2039.52] So in order to
[2039.52 → 2040.38] Kind of understand
[2040.38 → 2041.28] What's happening
[2041.28 → 2042.12] I think we need to
[2042.12 → 2043.20] Zoom out a bit
[2043.20 → 2044.14] And kind of look at
[2044.14 → 2045.54] What we've seen so far
[2045.54 → 2046.00] In Acts
[2046.00 → 2046.80] And what is happening
[2046.80 → 2048.28] So remember back
[2048.28 → 2049.24] In Acts chapter 2
[2049.24 → 2050.36] In Acts chapter 2
[2050.36 → 2050.76] Is what?
[2051.58 → 2052.36] It's Pentecost
[2052.36 → 2052.56] Right?
[2052.60 → 2053.84] The coming of the Holy Spirit
[2053.84 → 2054.88] Where the Holy Spirit
[2054.88 → 2055.68] Was poured out
[2055.68 → 2056.54] On His church
[2056.54 → 2058.06] And so just as
[2058.06 → 2058.90] God's presence
[2058.90 → 2060.42] Had filled the tabernacle
[2060.42 → 2061.94] In the Old Testament
[2061.94 → 2062.64] In the wilderness
[2062.64 → 2064.48] Now God's presence
[2064.48 → 2067.28] Was coming to dwell
[2067.28 → 2069.26] But now not in a building
[2069.26 → 2071.14] But in a people
[2071.14 → 2073.18] So God's people
[2073.18 → 2074.72] Have become like
[2074.72 → 2077.18] These little mobile tabernacles
[2077.18 → 2078.40] These mobile temples
[2078.40 → 2080.50] Filled with God's Spirit
[2080.50 → 2083.36] And one of the big themes
[2083.36 → 2083.96] That Luke
[2083.96 → 2085.18] The writer of Acts
[2085.18 → 2086.46] Wants us to see
[2086.46 → 2087.64] In these early chapters
[2087.64 → 2090.20] Is this tale of two temples
[2090.20 → 2091.34] Right?
[2091.40 → 2092.38] Not a tale of two cities
[2092.38 → 2094.08] But a tale of two temples
[2094.08 → 2096.16] And so you've got the temple
[2096.16 → 2097.26] That Herod built
[2097.26 → 2097.82] In Jerusalem
[2097.82 → 2098.86] And this is where
[2098.86 → 2100.28] The Israelites all worshipped
[2100.28 → 2102.06] But now there's this
[2102.06 → 2102.96] Jesus temple
[2102.96 → 2103.60] This temple
[2103.60 → 2104.48] Which consists
[2104.48 → 2106.10] Of Jesus' followers
[2106.10 → 2106.72] Who are people
[2106.72 → 2109.20] But then there's a conflict
[2109.20 → 2110.56] Between these two temples
[2110.56 → 2112.66] The leaders of the other temple
[2112.66 → 2113.60] Of Herod's temple
[2113.60 → 2115.28] Was threatened
[2115.28 → 2117.04] By this new temple
[2117.04 → 2118.86] And so they arrest the apostles
[2118.86 → 2119.60] And they tell them
[2119.60 → 2120.68] To stop teaching
[2120.68 → 2121.64] In the name of Jesus
[2121.64 → 2122.16] Right?
[2122.22 → 2122.76] And that's what we read
[2122.76 → 2123.48] About last week
[2123.48 → 2125.48] But now this new temple
[2125.48 → 2127.88] Continued to teach about Jesus
[2127.88 → 2130.64] And they're starting to go about life
[2130.64 → 2131.70] In a radically new way
[2131.70 → 2133.78] They're meeting together
[2133.78 → 2135.48] In homes all over Jerusalem
[2135.48 → 2138.08] They're sharing meals together
[2138.08 → 2139.74] They're gathering
[2139.74 → 2142.02] And saying their daily prayers together
[2142.02 → 2145.30] And they're selling their stuff
[2145.30 → 2147.38] And they're providing
[2147.38 → 2148.46] For the poor
[2148.46 → 2149.72] Among them
[2149.72 → 2150.94] And in their city
[2150.94 → 2154.66] And this practice
[2154.66 → 2155.96] Of giving their money
[2155.96 → 2157.02] To help the poor
[2157.02 → 2158.44] Was a practice
[2158.44 → 2159.42] That is described
[2159.42 → 2160.86] In the Old Testament
[2160.86 → 2162.14] Law of God
[2162.14 → 2162.62] The Torah
[2162.62 → 2164.24] And this was supposed
[2164.24 → 2165.06] To be happening
[2165.06 → 2166.66] Through the Jerusalem temples
[2166.66 → 2167.88] And its leaders
[2167.88 → 2168.88] Right?
[2168.98 → 2169.66] Herod's temple
[2169.66 → 2170.30] The leaders
[2170.30 → 2171.02] The Jewish leaders
[2171.02 → 2172.32] They were supposed to be
[2172.32 → 2173.62] Giving this money
[2173.62 → 2174.48] They were supposed to be
[2174.48 → 2175.42] Caring for the poor
[2175.42 → 2176.92] But they weren't doing it
[2176.92 → 2178.68] So now this new temple
[2178.68 → 2179.80] Of Jesus' community
[2179.80 → 2181.68] Is fulfilling the purpose
[2181.68 → 2183.02] That God had always intended
[2183.02 → 2183.62] For the temple
[2183.62 → 2185.42] That it would be a place
[2185.42 → 2187.20] Where people could
[2187.20 → 2188.66] Meet God
[2188.66 → 2189.74] Encounter God
[2189.74 → 2190.86] In his generosity
[2190.86 → 2192.70] And his presence
[2192.70 → 2195.10] So that's what's happening
[2195.10 → 2196.74] I want you to see this picture
[2196.74 → 2198.78] The new temple
[2198.78 → 2199.80] The people of God
[2199.80 → 2201.06] Filled by the Holy Spirit
[2201.06 → 2202.42] Fulfilling the purpose
[2202.42 → 2202.98] Of the temple
[2202.98 → 2203.80] Which was to care
[2203.80 → 2204.46] For the poor
[2204.46 → 2208.16] And what is fascinating
[2208.16 → 2209.82] About this early church
[2209.82 → 2210.84] Was that they were
[2210.84 → 2211.38] A community
[2211.38 → 2212.28] Not only that
[2212.28 → 2212.74] Just kind of
[2212.74 → 2213.94] Served the poor
[2213.94 → 2214.40] Right?
[2214.46 → 2214.94] As some like
[2214.94 → 2215.96] Abstract thing
[2215.96 → 2216.64] That they do
[2216.64 → 2217.98] It's not just that
[2217.98 → 2219.18] They were a community
[2219.18 → 2220.60] Of the poor
[2220.60 → 2222.24] They were a community
[2222.24 → 2224.00] With the poor
[2224.00 → 2224.70] Right?
[2224.78 → 2225.64] These widows
[2225.64 → 2227.38] Who were in need
[2227.38 → 2228.44] Economic need
[2228.44 → 2230.14] Were very much
[2230.14 → 2230.96] A part
[2230.96 → 2232.10] Of the community
[2232.10 → 2233.20] They were
[2233.20 → 2234.38] Welcomed in
[2234.38 → 2235.06] As family
[2235.06 → 2235.58] They were
[2235.58 → 2236.46] Mothers
[2236.46 → 2237.32] And sisters
[2237.32 → 2238.24] And friends
[2238.24 → 2239.16] In Christ
[2239.16 → 2242.30] So here's what
[2242.30 → 2244.04] The Athenian philosopher
[2244.04 → 2244.94] Aristides
[2244.94 → 2245.60] Writes
[2245.60 → 2247.14] And he's writing
[2247.14 → 2247.86] In the year
[2247.86 → 2248.90] 130 AD
[2248.90 → 2250.30] And he's actually
[2250.30 → 2251.18] Writing a treatise
[2251.18 → 2252.42] To Emperor Hadrian
[2252.42 → 2253.86] Describing the
[2253.86 → 2254.68] Christian community
[2254.68 → 2255.58] That he had witnessed
[2255.58 → 2256.40] And that he himself
[2256.40 → 2257.12] Had actually
[2257.12 → 2258.58] Become a part of
[2258.58 → 2259.30] He had converted
[2259.30 → 2260.18] To Christianity
[2260.18 → 2262.10] So he's writing
[2262.10 → 2262.74] To the emperor
[2262.74 → 2263.56] Trying to kind of
[2263.56 → 2264.86] Persuade him
[2264.86 → 2265.86] Of the beauty
[2265.86 → 2266.96] Of this Christian community
[2266.96 → 2268.24] So here's what he writes
[2268.24 → 2271.30] From the widows
[2271.30 → 2273.22] They do not turn away
[2273.22 → 2274.34] Their countenance
[2274.34 → 2275.88] They rescue
[2275.88 → 2276.50] The orphan
[2276.50 → 2277.62] From him
[2277.62 → 2278.08] Who would do
[2278.08 → 2278.74] Them injustice
[2278.74 → 2281.48] And he who has
[2281.48 → 2283.12] Gives to him
[2283.12 → 2284.08] Who has not
[2284.08 → 2285.24] Without grudging
[2285.24 → 2287.12] And if there is
[2287.12 → 2287.70] Among them
[2287.70 → 2288.52] A man that is
[2288.52 → 2289.56] Poor and needy
[2289.56 → 2291.96] And they have not
[2291.96 → 2292.70] An abundance
[2292.70 → 2294.22] Of necessaries
[2294.22 → 2296.38] They fast
[2296.38 → 2297.90] Two or three days
[2297.90 → 2299.42] That they may supply
[2299.42 → 2300.28] The needy
[2300.28 → 2301.30] With their
[2301.30 → 2302.30] Necessary food
[2302.30 → 2304.08] I was blown away
[2304.08 → 2304.54] By that
[2304.54 → 2308.08] If there was a need
[2308.08 → 2309.20] In the church family
[2309.20 → 2309.88] And they didn't
[2309.88 → 2310.62] Have extra
[2310.62 → 2312.20] They would fast
[2312.20 → 2313.76] For two or three days
[2313.76 → 2314.56] So that they could
[2314.56 → 2315.32] Take this food
[2315.32 → 2315.96] That they would have
[2315.96 → 2316.92] Eaten for themselves
[2316.92 → 2318.18] And given it
[2318.18 → 2319.12] To those who needy
[2319.12 → 2319.88] Who were needy
[2319.88 → 2320.12] Right
[2320.12 → 2320.98] That's amazing
[2320.98 → 2323.78] And I think this
[2323.78 → 2325.12] Is a remarkable account
[2325.12 → 2326.18] And it's a glimpse
[2326.18 → 2327.54] Into the lives
[2327.54 → 2328.48] Of these early Christians
[2328.48 → 2330.38] That was so marked
[2330.38 → 2331.74] By generosity
[2331.74 → 2333.08] That flowed
[2333.08 → 2333.90] From the gospel
[2333.90 → 2336.52] And because of this
[2336.52 → 2337.56] Radically new way
[2337.56 → 2338.18] Of life
[2338.18 → 2339.00] And very
[2339.00 → 2340.06] Early on
[2340.06 → 2340.68] In the church
[2340.68 → 2341.28] Already only
[2341.28 → 2342.40] In act six here
[2342.40 → 2343.90] They had established
[2343.90 → 2345.34] The system
[2345.34 → 2346.82] Of food distribution
[2346.82 → 2348.58] And they were again
[2348.58 → 2350.30] Being the temple
[2350.30 → 2351.42] They were a community
[2351.42 → 2352.44] With the poor
[2352.44 → 2353.48] And of the poor
[2353.48 → 2355.26] Fulfilling God's
[2355.26 → 2356.24] Intentions
[2356.24 → 2357.96] Of what it looks like
[2357.96 → 2358.86] It means to be
[2358.86 → 2360.00] The people of God
[2360.00 → 2361.96] Okay so that's
[2361.96 → 2362.64] The first point
[2362.64 → 2364.80] There's life together
[2364.80 → 2365.32] That was marked
[2365.32 → 2365.96] By generosity
[2365.96 → 2367.36] And the second thing
[2367.36 → 2368.04] Is that they had
[2368.04 → 2369.18] Shared something together
[2369.18 → 2371.52] Now what do they share?
[2372.46 → 2373.94] Of course they shared
[2373.94 → 2374.68] Their possessions
[2374.68 → 2375.88] They shared their wealth
[2375.88 → 2377.76] But this early church
[2377.76 → 2379.44] Was actually sharing together
[2379.44 → 2380.38] Something that was
[2380.38 → 2381.54] Much more profound
[2381.54 → 2383.60] And something that is
[2383.60 → 2385.48] Actually much more difficult
[2385.48 → 2387.54] Even than our possessions
[2387.54 → 2388.10] To share
[2388.10 → 2389.64] So let's look at
[2389.64 → 2390.40] What it was
[2390.40 → 2391.88] And when we look
[2391.88 → 2392.58] At this passage
[2392.58 → 2393.70] We see that a conflict
[2393.70 → 2395.26] Arises in this early church
[2395.26 → 2396.46] There's a complaint
[2396.46 → 2397.44] That arises
[2397.44 → 2399.66] From the Hellenists
[2399.66 → 2401.38] Against the Hebrews
[2401.38 → 2403.14] So who are these
[2403.14 → 2403.86] Two groups of people?
[2404.06 → 2405.08] The Hellenists
[2405.08 → 2406.48] Are used to thinking
[2406.48 → 2407.96] And speaking
[2407.96 → 2408.94] In what language?
[2409.90 → 2410.68] In Greek
[2410.68 → 2411.48] Okay
[2411.48 → 2412.52] They were Greek
[2412.52 → 2413.26] And they were very
[2413.26 → 2414.80] Immersed in that culture
[2414.80 → 2417.00] So these were Jews
[2417.00 → 2419.58] Who had dispersed
[2419.58 → 2420.90] Outside their homeland
[2420.90 → 2422.26] Centuries before
[2422.26 → 2423.72] For various reasons
[2423.72 → 2424.86] But who were now
[2424.86 → 2425.66] Kind of returning
[2425.66 → 2426.42] And living
[2426.42 → 2427.40] In Jerusalem
[2427.40 → 2429.26] So they were Greek speakers
[2429.26 → 2431.00] Shaped by that worldview
[2431.00 → 2431.64] And that culture
[2431.64 → 2433.62] But then you have
[2433.62 → 2434.66] These Hebraic Jews
[2434.66 → 2435.98] Who were Palestinians
[2435.98 → 2437.98] Who spoke Hebrew
[2437.98 → 2439.00] Or Aramaic
[2439.00 → 2440.38] And they had their own
[2440.38 → 2441.62] Particular way of living
[2441.62 → 2443.66] That was deeply shaped
[2443.66 → 2444.92] By their culture
[2444.92 → 2446.06] And that influenced
[2446.06 → 2446.90] The way they would think
[2446.90 → 2447.82] About things like food
[2447.82 → 2449.40] About things like relationships
[2449.40 → 2451.08] And so you know
[2451.08 → 2451.94] I think it's very easy
[2451.94 → 2452.56] For us to paint
[2452.56 → 2453.68] A romantic picture
[2453.68 → 2454.86] Of the early church
[2454.86 → 2456.22] But just like
[2456.22 → 2457.60] Them
[2457.60 → 2458.10] Today
[2458.10 → 2459.18] We also
[2459.18 → 2459.90] You know
[2459.90 → 2460.68] We're trying to create
[2460.68 → 2462.02] A cohesive community
[2462.02 → 2462.88] We're trying to be
[2462.88 → 2463.70] The church together
[2463.70 → 2465.44] More and more
[2465.44 → 2466.94] We have different histories
[2466.94 → 2468.72] Different lifestyles
[2468.72 → 2469.48] Different languages
[2469.48 → 2470.16] And culture
[2470.16 → 2472.14] And as we try
[2472.14 → 2473.22] To live together
[2473.22 → 2475.20] Almost inevitably
[2475.20 → 2476.80] Sometimes conflict
[2476.80 → 2478.62] And discomfort
[2478.62 → 2480.18] Can arise
[2480.18 → 2482.36] And that's what we are seeing
[2482.36 → 2483.70] That is going on here
[2483.70 → 2484.86] Right
[2484.86 → 2485.56] So in the midst
[2485.56 → 2486.46] Of this challenge
[2486.46 → 2487.18] Of feeding
[2487.18 → 2487.56] You know
[2487.56 → 2488.16] The disciples
[2488.16 → 2488.48] It says
[2488.48 → 2489.26] We're increasing
[2489.26 → 2490.68] More and more widows
[2490.68 → 2491.72] More and more need
[2491.72 → 2493.20] They're trying to feed
[2493.20 → 2493.90] All these people
[2493.90 → 2495.36] And at the same time
[2495.36 → 2496.06] Now there's all these
[2496.06 → 2497.34] Cultural and linguistic
[2497.34 → 2498.02] Differences
[2498.02 → 2500.08] So what happens
[2500.08 → 2502.20] Well the Hellenists
[2502.20 → 2503.32] Come to the apostles
[2503.32 → 2504.16] With a complaint
[2504.16 → 2504.84] And they say
[2504.84 → 2506.04] Our widows
[2506.04 → 2507.10] Are being neglected
[2507.10 → 2509.36] In this daily distribution
[2509.36 → 2510.52] They're being overlooked
[2510.52 → 2513.02] And I think it's important
[2513.02 → 2513.76] To notice that
[2513.76 → 2514.96] There is no indication
[2514.96 → 2515.70] From the text
[2515.70 → 2516.72] That this was intentional
[2516.72 → 2518.12] Right
[2518.12 → 2518.88] But you know
[2518.88 → 2519.36] They weren't
[2519.36 → 2519.60] You know
[2519.60 → 2520.84] Discriminating
[2520.84 → 2521.92] It seems
[2521.92 → 2523.58] Against these
[2523.58 → 2525.68] The Hellenist widows
[2525.68 → 2527.42] But what had happened
[2527.42 → 2528.26] Probably
[2528.26 → 2529.52] Is that they had
[2529.52 → 2530.40] Set up this system
[2530.40 → 2531.10] That was just kind of
[2531.10 → 2531.80] Tilted
[2531.80 → 2533.70] Towards better serving
[2533.70 → 2534.98] The Hebraic widows
[2534.98 → 2536.36] Because for one
[2536.36 → 2537.58] They were the majority group
[2537.58 → 2539.48] And so maybe
[2539.48 → 2540.56] As far as
[2540.56 → 2541.56] You know
[2541.56 → 2542.52] How you access
[2542.52 → 2543.20] The food
[2543.20 → 2544.12] You know
[2544.12 → 2545.10] Where you go
[2545.10 → 2546.28] When you go
[2546.28 → 2546.82] All of this
[2546.82 → 2547.50] Was set up
[2547.50 → 2548.38] According to
[2548.38 → 2549.42] You know
[2549.42 → 2550.30] The way of doing
[2550.30 → 2550.92] Things
[2550.92 → 2551.66] That the Hebrews
[2551.66 → 2552.08] Would have
[2552.08 → 2553.02] Understood
[2553.02 → 2554.22] And in their language
[2554.22 → 2555.56] And so this
[2555.56 → 2556.48] Greek group
[2556.48 → 2557.76] This was kind of
[2557.76 → 2558.66] All new to them
[2558.66 → 2559.04] It was
[2559.04 → 2559.82] You know
[2559.82 → 2560.94] It was in a different language
[2560.94 → 2561.50] They didn't know
[2561.50 → 2562.64] How things quite worked
[2562.64 → 2563.62] And as a result
[2563.62 → 2564.66] They were being neglected
[2564.66 → 2567.58] So the early church
[2567.58 → 2568.80] Was facing this problem
[2568.80 → 2570.54] Of this majority culture
[2570.54 → 2571.42] The Hebrews
[2571.42 → 2573.86] Probably unintentionally
[2573.86 → 2574.58] Excluding
[2574.58 → 2575.66] This minority group
[2575.66 → 2576.28] In the community
[2576.28 → 2577.22] Who were the Hellenists
[2577.22 → 2578.86] And friends
[2578.86 → 2579.82] I think that
[2579.82 → 2582.08] We continue to face
[2582.08 → 2582.64] The same thing
[2582.64 → 2583.46] In the church today
[2583.46 → 2585.60] And
[2585.60 → 2586.46] Excuse me
[2586.46 → 2586.94] And so
[2586.94 → 2588.32] Kind of in the
[2588.32 → 2590.10] Management policy world
[2590.10 → 2591.58] There is a
[2591.58 → 2592.56] Famous fable
[2592.56 → 2593.48] That is told
[2593.48 → 2595.12] And it's the fable
[2595.12 → 2595.98] Of the giraffe
[2595.98 → 2596.72] And the elephant
[2596.72 → 2598.26] So I heard this
[2598.26 → 2599.68] Story from
[2599.68 → 2600.46] A pastor named
[2600.46 → 2601.16] Abraham CHO
[2601.16 → 2601.80] And so he
[2601.80 → 2602.60] Kind of told the story
[2602.60 → 2603.20] Like this
[2603.20 → 2605.48] Once upon a time
[2605.48 → 2606.22] There was
[2606.22 → 2607.84] A giraffe
[2607.84 → 2609.28] And giraffe
[2609.28 → 2610.44] Decided to build
[2610.44 → 2611.58] Himself a home
[2611.58 → 2612.76] And he built
[2612.76 → 2613.48] This home
[2613.48 → 2614.30] That was perfectly
[2614.30 → 2614.90] Suited
[2614.90 → 2616.44] For a giraffe
[2616.44 → 2618.48] It had
[2618.48 → 2619.26] As you can imagine
[2619.26 → 2620.50] High ceilings
[2620.50 → 2621.72] It had
[2621.72 → 2622.92] Narrow doors
[2622.92 → 2623.96] And hallways
[2623.96 → 2625.58] And it had
[2625.58 → 2626.24] Windows
[2626.24 → 2627.20] Which were placed
[2627.20 → 2628.28] At the perfect height
[2628.28 → 2629.46] For a giraffe
[2629.46 → 2630.98] The tables
[2630.98 → 2631.40] And chairs
[2631.40 → 2632.02] Inside the house
[2632.02 → 2633.12] Were perfectly designed
[2633.12 → 2634.14] For the needs
[2634.14 → 2634.86] Of a giraffe
[2634.86 → 2636.80] And so it's a house
[2636.80 → 2637.82] That would have won
[2637.82 → 2638.70] The giraffe
[2638.70 → 2640.98] The giraffe home
[2640.98 → 2641.54] Of the year
[2641.54 → 2642.32] Right
[2642.32 → 2643.02] It was perfect
[2643.02 → 2643.72] For a giraffe
[2643.72 → 2645.86] So one day
[2645.86 → 2646.58] Giraffe
[2646.58 → 2647.68] Decides he wants
[2647.68 → 2648.70] To invite his friend
[2648.70 → 2649.22] Elephant
[2649.22 → 2651.06] Over for tea
[2651.06 → 2653.30] Elephant is delighted
[2653.30 → 2654.16] To be invited
[2654.16 → 2655.68] To giraffe's house
[2655.68 → 2656.76] But the moment
[2656.76 → 2657.36] That elephant
[2657.36 → 2659.06] Arrives at giraffe's home
[2659.06 → 2659.62] He immediately
[2659.62 → 2660.14] Realizes
[2660.14 → 2661.04] That this is going
[2661.04 → 2661.46] To be
[2661.46 → 2662.58] An uncomfortable
[2662.58 → 2663.70] Experience for him
[2663.70 → 2665.72] As giraffe
[2665.72 → 2666.76] Greets him warmly
[2666.76 → 2667.46] At the door
[2667.46 → 2668.68] And invites him in
[2668.68 → 2669.98] Right away
[2669.98 → 2670.66] Elephant
[2670.66 → 2672.20] Can't fit through the door
[2672.20 → 2673.58] It being
[2673.58 → 2673.92] Of course
[2673.92 → 2674.88] Very tall and narrow
[2674.88 → 2676.50] But giraffe
[2676.50 → 2677.36] Insists
[2677.36 → 2678.90] That he come in
[2678.90 → 2679.80] And so elephant
[2679.80 → 2680.90] You know
[2680.90 → 2681.62] Not wanting to be
[2681.62 → 2682.22] A bad guest
[2682.22 → 2683.28] He pushes his way
[2683.28 → 2683.92] Through the door
[2683.92 → 2684.68] Into the house
[2684.68 → 2685.72] Damaging
[2685.72 → 2686.94] The door frame
[2686.94 → 2687.80] On his way in
[2687.80 → 2689.52] Giraffe
[2689.52 → 2690.82] Frowns at this
[2690.82 → 2692.28] But he shakes it off
[2692.28 → 2693.48] And then
[2693.48 → 2694.22] Giraffe invites
[2694.22 → 2694.62] Elephant
[2694.62 → 2695.28] To come in
[2695.28 → 2695.78] And sit down
[2695.78 → 2696.40] At his table
[2696.40 → 2698.06] Elephant
[2698.06 → 2698.74] Politely
[2698.74 → 2699.78] Declines
[2699.78 → 2700.18] And says
[2700.18 → 2700.38] You know
[2700.38 → 2700.88] I'm fine
[2700.88 → 2701.44] I'm just going
[2701.44 → 2702.20] To stand over here
[2702.20 → 2703.90] But giraffe
[2703.90 → 2704.22] Says
[2704.22 → 2704.50] You know
[2704.50 → 2704.82] Please
[2704.82 → 2705.44] Make yourself
[2705.44 → 2705.84] At home
[2705.84 → 2706.52] I really want
[2706.52 → 2706.84] You to feel
[2706.84 → 2707.64] Comfortable here
[2707.64 → 2709.12] Please take a seat
[2709.12 → 2710.54] And so again
[2710.54 → 2711.06] Elephant
[2711.06 → 2711.50] Not wanting
[2711.50 → 2712.42] To be a bad guest
[2712.42 → 2713.06] He carefully
[2713.06 → 2714.22] Tries to sit down
[2714.22 → 2714.84] In one of these
[2714.84 → 2716.06] Narrow tall chairs
[2716.06 → 2718.30] But what he fears
[2718.30 → 2719.02] The most
[2719.02 → 2720.00] Happens
[2720.00 → 2721.14] The chair
[2721.14 → 2721.94] Just wasn't
[2721.94 → 2722.36] Made
[2722.36 → 2723.32] To bear
[2723.32 → 2723.96] His weight
[2723.96 → 2725.04] So the chair
[2725.04 → 2725.68] Breaks
[2725.68 → 2726.70] To the great
[2726.70 → 2727.60] Embarrassment
[2727.60 → 2728.26] Of elephant
[2728.26 → 2729.88] And giraffe
[2729.88 → 2730.48] Is puzzled
[2730.48 → 2730.90] He says
[2730.90 → 2731.34] Elephant
[2731.34 → 2732.06] What's the matter
[2732.06 → 2733.14] I just want
[2733.14 → 2733.52] To make you
[2733.52 → 2734.28] Feel at home
[2734.28 → 2735.22] Right
[2735.22 → 2735.60] I'm doing
[2735.60 → 2736.62] Everything I can
[2736.62 → 2737.14] To make you
[2737.14 → 2737.72] Feel welcome
[2737.72 → 2738.56] What more
[2738.56 → 2739.30] Can I do
[2739.30 → 2741.66] And elephant
[2741.66 → 2742.28] As grateful
[2742.28 → 2743.14] As he was
[2743.14 → 2744.44] For the friendship
[2744.44 → 2745.58] He turns
[2745.58 → 2746.24] To giraffe
[2746.24 → 2746.88] And says
[2746.88 → 2748.04] To tell you
[2748.04 → 2748.54] The truth
[2748.54 → 2750.04] I'm just not
[2750.04 → 2751.08] Sure that a house
[2751.08 → 2752.40] Built for a giraffe
[2752.40 → 2753.90] Will ever really
[2753.90 → 2754.90] Work for an elephant
[2754.90 → 2756.86] Not unless
[2756.86 → 2757.50] There are
[2757.50 → 2758.30] Some major
[2758.30 → 2759.06] Changes
[2759.06 → 2761.70] Now what's the
[2761.70 → 2762.26] Point of the
[2762.26 → 2762.60] Fable
[2762.60 → 2765.14] Well I think
[2765.14 → 2766.08] The point is
[2766.08 → 2767.70] That the way
[2767.70 → 2768.92] We structure
[2768.92 → 2769.38] Things
[2769.38 → 2769.80] The way we
[2769.80 → 2770.36] Do things
[2770.36 → 2770.82] Together
[2770.82 → 2771.74] As a community
[2771.74 → 2772.98] Though often
[2772.98 → 2774.08] Not intentionally
[2774.08 → 2774.84] Trying to
[2774.84 → 2775.56] Discriminate
[2775.56 → 2776.52] Against certain
[2776.52 → 2777.02] People
[2777.02 → 2778.66] In practice
[2778.66 → 2780.56] And in outcome
[2780.56 → 2781.72] It can be
[2781.72 → 2782.34] Very hard
[2782.34 → 2783.10] For some people
[2783.10 → 2784.58] To feel at home
[2784.58 → 2785.12] And to feel
[2785.12 → 2785.46] Welcome
[2785.46 → 2787.28] And we can be
[2787.28 → 2788.22] Blind to that
[2788.22 → 2788.72] Truth
[2788.72 → 2790.24] Until someone
[2790.24 → 2791.46] Comes and tells
[2791.46 → 2791.84] Us
[2791.84 → 2793.50] And so in the
[2793.50 → 2794.20] Early church
[2794.20 → 2794.98] The system of
[2794.98 → 2795.76] Daily distribution
[2795.76 → 2796.68] Was exactly
[2796.68 → 2797.26] That
[2797.26 → 2798.26] Right
[2798.26 → 2798.92] It wasn't going
[2798.92 → 2799.46] To work for
[2799.46 → 2800.14] Everyone in the
[2800.14 → 2800.92] Community unless
[2800.92 → 2801.42] There were some
[2801.42 → 2802.22] Major changes
[2802.22 → 2802.90] That were made
[2802.90 → 2804.22] So what
[2804.22 → 2804.72] Do they do
[2804.72 → 2806.16] The apostles
[2806.16 → 2807.16] The ones
[2807.16 → 2807.68] Whom God
[2807.68 → 2808.40] Had made
[2808.40 → 2809.24] The foundation
[2809.24 → 2810.10] Of the church
[2810.10 → 2811.64] Asked
[2811.64 → 2812.58] The congregation
[2812.58 → 2814.02] To elect
[2814.02 → 2815.60] Seven men
[2815.60 → 2816.66] Who were full
[2816.66 → 2817.30] Of the spirit
[2817.30 → 2817.92] And of wisdom
[2817.92 → 2819.82] And this passage
[2819.82 → 2820.56] Has long been
[2820.56 → 2821.60] Regarded by the church
[2821.60 → 2822.20] As the beginning
[2822.20 → 2823.04] Of the diaconate
[2823.04 → 2824.90] It was the beginning
[2824.90 → 2825.92] Of setting apart
[2825.92 → 2826.78] Some people
[2826.78 → 2827.82] Who would
[2827.82 → 2829.50] Care for the community
[2829.50 → 2830.06] Make sure
[2830.06 → 2831.10] That the church
[2831.10 → 2832.20] Would continue
[2832.20 → 2833.30] To be a community
[2833.30 → 2834.34] That cared deeply
[2834.34 → 2835.24] For one another
[2835.24 → 2836.42] And that's why
[2836.42 → 2838.08] Deacons and deaconesses
[2838.08 → 2839.62] Are still vital
[2839.62 → 2841.14] To our church today
[2841.14 → 2843.66] But did you notice
[2843.66 → 2844.26] What they did
[2844.26 → 2845.54] In response to this problem
[2845.54 → 2847.44] Every single one
[2847.44 → 2848.26] Of those names
[2848.26 → 2850.00] That we see there
[2850.00 → 2851.00] In verse 5
[2851.00 → 2852.18] Are Greek
[2852.18 → 2853.44] Right
[2853.44 → 2854.50] The seven called
[2854.50 → 2855.16] To serve
[2855.16 → 2856.26] In leadership roles
[2856.26 → 2856.92] In the church
[2856.92 → 2858.18] What group
[2858.18 → 2858.78] Were they from
[2858.78 → 2860.60] They were from
[2860.60 → 2861.78] The Hellenist group
[2861.78 → 2864.04] So the early church
[2864.04 → 2864.84] Understood that
[2864.84 → 2865.66] In order to fix
[2865.66 → 2866.26] A system
[2866.26 → 2867.10] That was privileging
[2867.10 → 2867.62] One group
[2867.62 → 2868.34] Over the other
[2868.34 → 2869.30] What they needed
[2869.30 → 2870.00] To do
[2870.00 → 2870.94] Was they needed
[2870.94 → 2871.78] To bring in
[2871.78 → 2872.46] The voices
[2872.46 → 2873.96] Of the marginalized
[2873.96 → 2874.50] Group
[2874.50 → 2876.78] They had to give
[2876.78 → 2877.80] Them decision
[2877.80 → 2878.70] Making power
[2878.70 → 2880.70] Because those
[2880.70 → 2881.74] Greek speaking
[2881.74 → 2882.46] Hellenists
[2882.46 → 2883.68] Were better able
[2883.68 → 2884.68] To solve the problem
[2884.68 → 2886.28] Right
[2886.28 → 2886.98] And this was
[2886.98 → 2888.00] This is incredible
[2888.00 → 2888.82] That would even
[2888.82 → 2889.46] Be incredible
[2889.46 → 2889.86] Today
[2889.86 → 2892.62] And actually
[2892.62 → 2893.42] The early church
[2893.42 → 2894.14] Went even
[2894.14 → 2895.06] One step further
[2895.06 → 2896.32] Because that
[2896.32 → 2897.16] Very last name
[2897.16 → 2897.98] There in the list
[2897.98 → 2898.54] Nicholas
[2898.54 → 2899.98] Of Antioch
[2899.98 → 2900.98] He wasn't even
[2900.98 → 2901.62] A Jew at all
[2901.62 → 2903.74] He was a Gentile
[2903.74 → 2904.72] Who had converted
[2904.72 → 2905.66] First to Judaism
[2905.66 → 2906.80] To worship
[2906.80 → 2907.62] The one God
[2907.62 → 2908.50] But then
[2908.50 → 2909.40] He had converted
[2909.40 → 2910.28] To Christianity
[2910.28 → 2911.32] To following Jesus
[2911.32 → 2912.98] And so here
[2912.98 → 2914.04] Was another
[2914.04 → 2914.84] Potentially
[2914.84 → 2915.58] Marginalized
[2915.58 → 2915.90] Group
[2915.90 → 2917.74] The Gentiles
[2917.74 → 2918.12] Who would be
[2918.12 → 2918.86] Coming into the church
[2918.86 → 2919.94] That would also
[2919.94 → 2920.68] Need a voice
[2920.68 → 2923.90] So here's the question
[2923.90 → 2924.88] What was it
[2924.88 → 2925.66] That they shared
[2925.66 → 2926.08] Together
[2926.08 → 2927.98] It wasn't just
[2927.98 → 2928.52] Their wealth
[2928.52 → 2929.24] And their material
[2929.24 → 2929.94] Goods
[2929.94 → 2932.06] What the early church
[2932.06 → 2932.80] Shared together
[2932.80 → 2934.14] That was so remarkable
[2934.14 → 2935.62] Then and today
[2935.62 → 2937.32] Is they shared power
[2937.32 → 2940.26] In an empire
[2940.26 → 2940.72] Sorry
[2940.72 → 2941.62] An empire
[2941.62 → 2943.06] That was used
[2943.06 → 2943.76] To conquering
[2943.76 → 2944.64] Minority people
[2944.64 → 2946.38] Crushing other cultures
[2946.38 → 2947.30] And taking power
[2947.30 → 2948.06] For themselves
[2948.06 → 2949.50] Here was a community
[2949.50 → 2951.22] Who was willing
[2951.22 → 2952.86] To share power
[2952.86 → 2953.50] With those who
[2953.50 → 2954.30] Didn't have it
[2954.30 → 2955.10] Right
[2955.10 → 2956.08] They didn't just say
[2956.08 → 2956.70] You know
[2956.70 → 2957.72] Sorry
[2957.72 → 2958.14] You know
[2958.14 → 2958.50] We're gonna
[2958.50 → 2958.98] We're gonna
[2958.98 → 2959.92] Make sure
[2959.92 → 2960.92] That your Greek widows
[2960.92 → 2962.02] Get some food too
[2962.02 → 2962.80] We're generous
[2962.80 → 2964.50] They
[2964.50 → 2966.42] Saw the problem
[2966.42 → 2966.72] And they
[2966.72 → 2967.80] And it was so important
[2967.80 → 2968.98] That these
[2968.98 → 2969.98] These people
[2969.98 → 2970.82] Felt loved
[2970.82 → 2971.36] They felt
[2971.36 → 2972.36] Cared for
[2972.36 → 2972.86] That they
[2972.86 → 2975.74] All of these things
[2975.74 → 2976.10] That
[2976.10 → 2978.60] They
[2978.60 → 2979.10] That they
[2979.10 → 2979.70] Empowered
[2979.70 → 2980.54] This other group
[2980.54 → 2981.54] Because they
[2981.54 → 2982.40] Knew best
[2982.40 → 2984.02] And they put them
[2984.02 → 2985.04] In charge of it
[2985.04 → 2986.64] And friends
[2986.64 → 2986.86] Again
[2986.86 → 2987.74] This is very hard
[2987.74 → 2988.12] To do
[2988.12 → 2989.32] Right
[2989.32 → 2990.18] It is one thing
[2990.18 → 2991.98] To share food
[2991.98 → 2992.60] And possessions
[2992.60 → 2993.84] But it's a whole
[2993.84 → 2994.62] Another thing
[2994.62 → 2995.96] To share power
[2995.96 → 2996.74] To view
[2996.74 → 2996.76] To view
[2996.76 → 2997.66] Other people
[2997.66 → 2999.04] As
[2999.04 → 3000.02] Who are
[3000.02 → 3000.74] Ethnically
[3000.74 → 3001.50] Maybe culturally
[3001.50 → 3002.48] Different from you
[3002.48 → 3003.96] As having something
[3003.96 → 3005.10] Equally valuable
[3005.10 → 3006.86] To share
[3006.86 → 3008.56] To be equally
[3008.56 → 3009.84] Able to participate
[3009.84 → 3010.82] And to contribute
[3010.82 → 3012.12] And to serve one another
[3012.12 → 3012.80] In the community
[3012.80 → 3017.18] So why did they do it?
[3018.26 → 3020.20] Why would this early church
[3020.20 → 3022.38] Give so generously
[3022.38 → 3023.30] Not only
[3023.30 → 3024.16] Of their food
[3024.16 → 3024.92] And possessions
[3024.92 → 3026.62] But give
[3026.62 → 3028.56] Of decision-making
[3028.56 → 3029.40] Power
[3029.40 → 3030.40] And empowering
[3030.40 → 3031.56] Everyone in the church
[3031.56 → 3032.24] To care and help
[3032.24 → 3032.74] For others
[3032.74 → 3033.82] And I think
[3033.82 → 3034.96] The answer to that question
[3034.96 → 3036.18] Of why they did it
[3036.18 → 3037.18] Is in verse 7
[3037.18 → 3038.84] Our final verse here
[3038.84 → 3039.48] It says
[3039.48 → 3040.66] So the word
[3040.66 → 3041.08] Of God
[3041.08 → 3041.48] Spread
[3041.48 → 3042.72] The number
[3042.72 → 3043.26] Of disciples
[3043.26 → 3043.88] In Jerusalem
[3043.88 → 3045.02] Increased rapidly
[3045.02 → 3046.48] And a large number
[3046.48 → 3047.14] Of priests
[3047.14 → 3047.84] Became obedient
[3047.84 → 3048.56] To the faith
[3048.56 → 3050.74] See Luke
[3050.74 → 3052.24] Wants to be
[3052.24 → 3052.86] Wants us
[3052.86 → 3053.50] To be perfectly
[3053.50 → 3054.02] Clear
[3054.02 → 3055.34] That this
[3055.34 → 3056.10] Remarkable
[3056.10 → 3056.62] Community
[3056.62 → 3057.70] Of the early church
[3057.70 → 3058.70] Was not just
[3058.70 → 3059.12] A result
[3059.12 → 3059.94] Of human effort
[3059.94 → 3060.82] It wasn't just
[3060.82 → 3061.24] Like they were
[3061.24 → 3062.92] Such an amazing
[3062.92 → 3063.62] Group of people
[3063.62 → 3064.12] Who happened
[3064.12 → 3064.96] To find each other
[3064.96 → 3067.02] But rather
[3067.02 → 3068.16] This radical
[3068.16 → 3069.02] Kind of
[3069.02 → 3069.98] Generous community
[3069.98 → 3071.38] Came about
[3071.38 → 3072.30] Because of the
[3072.30 → 3072.90] Word of God
[3072.90 → 3074.44] Right
[3074.44 → 3075.68] It's the word
[3075.68 → 3076.46] That tells us
[3076.46 → 3077.38] That Jesus Christ
[3077.38 → 3078.28] The son of God
[3078.28 → 3079.54] He gave up
[3079.54 → 3079.96] Everything
[3079.96 → 3081.24] And he
[3081.24 → 3082.00] Willingly
[3082.00 → 3082.98] Served
[3082.98 → 3084.48] He went to the
[3084.48 → 3084.90] Cross
[3084.90 → 3085.40] And he died
[3085.40 → 3085.80] For you
[3085.80 → 3087.62] And friends
[3087.62 → 3088.40] When you see
[3088.40 → 3089.10] Jesus Christ
[3089.10 → 3090.48] Love you like that
[3090.48 → 3091.82] What does that
[3091.82 → 3092.40] Do for you
[3092.40 → 3094.12] It gives you
[3094.12 → 3095.44] A new confidence
[3095.44 → 3097.00] It gives you
[3097.00 → 3098.08] A new security
[3098.08 → 3099.06] A new identity
[3099.06 → 3100.40] And it shakes you
[3100.40 → 3100.96] Free
[3100.96 → 3102.94] To not have to
[3102.94 → 3103.84] Kind of hold on
[3103.84 → 3104.48] To power
[3104.48 → 3105.44] To not have to
[3105.44 → 3106.06] Hold on to
[3106.06 → 3106.74] Possessions
[3106.74 → 3108.24] And hoard things
[3108.24 → 3109.76] Because you don't
[3109.76 → 3110.44] Need those things
[3110.44 → 3111.18] Anymore to have
[3111.18 → 3111.96] A sense of value
[3111.96 → 3112.72] You don't need
[3112.72 → 3113.36] Those things to have
[3113.36 → 3114.26] A sense of security
[3114.26 → 3115.42] Because you have
[3115.42 → 3116.80] Everything in Christ
[3116.80 → 3118.88] And so you are
[3118.88 → 3120.24] Free to be
[3120.24 → 3121.32] Radically generous
[3121.32 → 3123.34] And friends
[3123.34 → 3124.64] I think just as
[3124.64 → 3125.70] The early church
[3125.70 → 3126.60] Needed that
[3126.60 → 3128.34] And just as
[3128.34 → 3128.84] They
[3128.84 → 3129.96] And being this
[3129.96 → 3130.50] Community
[3130.50 → 3132.38] Caused the
[3132.38 → 3133.24] Caused people
[3133.24 → 3134.34] From all over
[3134.34 → 3135.46] To see
[3135.46 → 3136.42] How different
[3136.42 → 3136.94] They were
[3136.94 → 3137.82] And to be so
[3137.82 → 3138.60] Attracted
[3138.60 → 3139.38] And to come
[3139.38 → 3140.34] To faith in Christ
[3140.34 → 3141.88] We need that
[3141.88 → 3142.24] Today
[3142.24 → 3143.28] We need the
[3143.28 → 3143.86] Gospel to
[3143.86 → 3144.78] Transform us
[3144.78 → 3146.08] To make us
[3146.08 → 3147.10] A radically
[3147.10 → 3148.12] Generous community
[3148.12 → 3149.28] And so that
[3149.28 → 3150.08] Our community
[3150.08 → 3150.70] Our city
[3150.70 → 3151.14] And people
[3151.14 → 3151.86] Would look at us
[3151.86 → 3152.38] And say look at
[3152.38 → 3153.00] How these Christians
[3153.00 → 3153.92] Love one another
[3153.92 → 3156.28] So here's the question
[3156.28 → 3157.44] Are you open to that?
[3159.08 → 3160.64] Are we open as a church
[3160.64 → 3161.28] To welcoming
[3161.28 → 3163.10] People who are
[3163.10 → 3164.40] Culturally different
[3164.40 → 3165.00] From us?
[3165.48 → 3166.64] Are we willing to
[3166.64 → 3167.98] Welcome them in a way
[3167.98 → 3168.90] That not only
[3168.90 → 3170.00] Says hey come into
[3170.00 → 3170.70] This house built
[3170.70 → 3171.44] For a giraffe
[3171.44 → 3174.42] But to build a church
[3174.42 → 3176.10] Where they can also
[3176.10 → 3176.74] Be welcome
[3176.74 → 3177.48] And feel comfortable
[3177.48 → 3178.42] And have a voice
[3178.42 → 3179.62] And in this way
[3179.62 → 3180.60] Love one another
[3180.60 → 3181.74] For the glory of God
[3181.74 → 3183.64] Let's be a church
[3183.64 → 3184.12] Like that
[3184.12 → 3185.44] By the gospel
[3185.44 → 3186.62] Through the gospel
[3186.62 → 3187.90] By the spirit's help
[3187.90 → 3188.98] Let's pray together
[3188.98 → 3192.94] Father we thank you
[3192.94 → 3193.78] For this
[3193.78 → 3194.94] This glimpse
[3194.94 → 3196.52] Into what it looks like
[3196.52 → 3197.18] When the gospel
[3197.18 → 3197.82] Takes root
[3197.82 → 3198.52] In a community
[3198.52 → 3200.68] When it transforms
[3200.68 → 3201.48] People
[3201.48 → 3203.40] Because we see
[3203.40 → 3204.50] The love of God
[3204.50 → 3205.40] That we received
[3205.40 → 3206.44] The forgiveness
[3206.44 → 3207.40] That we have
[3207.40 → 3208.30] That causes us
[3208.30 → 3209.40] To put off
[3209.40 → 3210.36] Self-righteousness
[3210.36 → 3212.22] And to love others
[3212.22 → 3213.30] Lord as you
[3213.30 → 3214.14] Have loved us
[3214.14 → 3215.64] Lord you have
[3215.64 → 3216.56] Called us to be
[3216.56 → 3217.46] The temple
[3217.46 → 3218.38] Of the living God
[3218.38 → 3219.98] And would you
[3219.98 → 3221.16] Make us so
[3221.16 → 3222.46] By your word
[3222.46 → 3223.30] And by your spirit
[3223.30 → 3225.26] Lord work in us
[3225.26 → 3226.08] We ask
[3226.08 → 3227.08] We pray
[3227.08 → 3228.12] In Jesus name
[3228.12 → 3228.62] Amen
[3228.62 → 3230.72] So I invite you now
[3230.72 → 3231.60] Let's all stand
[3231.60 → 3232.82] And let's
[3232.82 → 3234.38] Worship the Lord
[3234.38 → 3235.62] With a song of response
[3235.62 → 3254.92] Be thou my vision
[3254.92 → 3259.24] O Lord of my heart
[3259.24 → 3262.22] Not be all else
[3262.22 → 3264.14] To be saved
[3264.14 → 3266.76] That thou art
[3266.76 → 3270.36] Thou my best thought
[3270.36 → 3274.28] By day or by night
[3274.28 → 3277.12] Waking or sleeping
[3277.12 → 3281.72] Thy presence my light
[3281.72 → 3287.04] Be thou my wisdom
[3287.04 → 3291.46] And thou my true word
[3291.46 → 3295.10] I ever with thee
[3295.10 → 3297.36] And thou with me
[3297.36 → 3298.76] Lord
[3298.76 → 3301.98] Thou my great father
[3301.98 → 3305.96] Thine own may I be
[3305.96 → 3309.18] Thou in me dwelling
[3309.18 → 3313.64] And I one with thee
[3313.64 → 3319.24] Wishes I heed not
[3319.24 → 3323.30] Nor faint empty praise
[3323.30 → 3327.00] Thou mine inheritance
[3327.00 → 3330.70] Thou and always
[3330.70 → 3333.70] Thou and only
[3333.70 → 3334.44] Thou only
[3334.44 → 3337.70] First in my heart
[3338.30 → 3340.70] I King of heaven
[3341.28 → 3345.70] I treasure thou art
[3345.70 → 3350.70] I King of heaven
[3351.24 → 3355.76] My victory won
[3355.76 → 3358.70] May I reach heaven
[3358.70 → 3360.90] Franchise O bright
[3360.90 → 3362.82] Heaven's son
[3362.82 → 3366.44] Heart of my own heart
[3366.44 → 3370.06] Whatever befall
[3370.06 → 3373.52] Still be my vision
[3373.52 → 3378.98] O will you have all
[3378.98 → 3391.28] So we come now
[3391.28 → 3392.04] to a time
[3392.04 → 3393.54] of prayer
[3393.54 → 3395.02] of supplication
[3395.02 → 3395.78] praying for
[3395.78 → 3397.48] our church
[3397.48 → 3398.86] our world
[3398.86 → 3400.00] and I want to do something
[3400.00 → 3401.06] a little bit different today
[3401.06 → 3402.22] I want to start with a litany
[3402.22 → 3404.34] a litany is kind of a prayer
[3404.34 → 3405.36] that is responsive
[3405.36 → 3407.02] and it's a litany
[3407.02 → 3407.96] for the church
[3407.96 → 3409.36] and just because of
[3409.36 → 3410.38] the passage today
[3410.38 → 3411.96] and considering together
[3411.96 → 3413.26] what it means to be the church
[3413.26 → 3414.04] I just thought we
[3414.04 → 3415.28] let's pray together
[3415.28 → 3416.06] for the church
[3416.06 → 3416.64] in this way
[3416.64 → 3417.48] using this litany
[3417.48 → 3419.08] and then we will go
[3419.08 → 3420.20] and we can pray
[3420.20 → 3420.92] for some
[3420.92 → 3421.84] of the
[3421.84 → 3423.44] the specific concerns
[3423.44 → 3424.26] that we have
[3424.26 → 3425.24] as a community
[3425.24 → 3426.98] okay so let's
[3426.98 → 3429.26] say this litany
[3429.26 → 3430.08] and for those
[3430.08 → 3431.22] of course the bold part
[3431.22 → 3432.00] is where you respond
[3432.00 → 3432.52] and I'll
[3432.52 → 3434.28] indicate to you all here
[3434.28 → 3437.02] O God the Father
[3437.02 → 3439.52] from whom the whole church
[3439.52 → 3440.90] in heaven and on earth
[3440.90 → 3441.46] is named
[3441.46 → 3443.68] O God the Son
[3443.68 → 3444.80] who lives as head
[3444.80 → 3445.66] over the church
[3445.66 → 3448.02] O God the Holy Spirit
[3448.02 → 3449.98] who gathers and perfects
[3449.98 → 3450.56] the church
[3450.56 → 3452.40] O Holy Trinity
[3452.40 → 3453.54] eternal love
[3453.54 → 3455.96] have mercy upon us
[3455.96 → 3458.86] that it may please you
[3458.86 → 3459.56] to strengthen
[3459.56 → 3461.58] and enlarge your holy church
[3461.58 → 3462.50] in every land
[3462.50 → 3464.24] and to unite all those
[3464.24 → 3464.74] who profess
[3464.74 → 3465.62] and call themselves
[3465.62 → 3466.70] Christians in faith
[3466.70 → 3468.18] and hope
[3468.18 → 3468.88] and charity
[3468.88 → 3470.90] we beseech you
[3470.90 → 3471.48] good Lord
[3471.48 → 3473.68] that your church
[3473.68 → 3474.34] may strive
[3474.34 → 3475.58] not for its own safety
[3475.58 → 3477.52] but for the world's salvation
[3477.52 → 3479.70] seeking only your kingdom
[3479.70 → 3480.82] and your righteousness
[3480.82 → 3483.08] we beseech you
[3483.08 → 3483.80] good Lord
[3483.80 → 3485.96] that you will grant
[3485.96 → 3486.84] to all ministers
[3486.84 → 3487.62] of your word
[3487.62 → 3489.62] the spirit of wisdom
[3489.62 → 3491.32] power and love
[3491.32 → 3493.08] and call many more
[3493.08 → 3493.84] to the work
[3493.84 → 3494.78] of your ministry
[3494.78 → 3496.80] we beseech you
[3496.80 → 3497.52] good Lord
[3497.52 → 3499.52] that regardless
[3499.52 → 3500.38] of the praise
[3500.38 → 3500.94] or contempt
[3500.94 → 3501.62] of the world
[3501.62 → 3502.74] your church
[3502.74 → 3503.30] may worship
[3503.30 → 3504.12] and adore you
[3504.12 → 3504.66] in spirit
[3504.66 → 3505.74] and in truth
[3505.74 → 3507.72] we beseech you
[3507.72 → 3508.48] good Lord
[3508.48 → 3510.76] so let's continue
[3510.76 → 3511.56] to pray together
[3511.56 → 3513.18] and Lord
[3513.18 → 3514.50] we do beseech you
[3514.50 → 3515.74] that you would make us
[3515.74 → 3518.44] into a community
[3518.44 → 3519.66] of radical generosity
[3519.66 → 3522.72] that you would bless
[3522.72 → 3524.42] even right now
[3524.42 → 3526.12] the Mandarin Fellowship
[3526.12 → 3526.64] who is meeting
[3526.64 → 3527.58] in the fireside room
[3527.58 → 3528.36] who are also
[3528.36 → 3530.42] opening up your word
[3530.42 → 3531.36] and praying together
[3531.36 → 3532.40] Lord we ask
[3532.40 → 3533.24] that you would continue
[3533.24 → 3535.12] to work
[3535.12 → 3537.62] through Nancy
[3537.62 → 3538.56] and through
[3538.56 → 3539.72] her co-workers
[3539.72 → 3540.88] Lord that you would bring
[3540.88 → 3542.68] many of the Chinese people
[3542.68 → 3543.56] who live in Delta
[3543.56 → 3545.28] who don't have a church
[3545.28 → 3545.98] in Mandarin
[3545.98 → 3547.72] where their language barrier
[3547.72 → 3548.62] would keep them
[3548.62 → 3549.82] from hearing the gospel
[3549.82 → 3551.24] Lord would you draw them
[3551.24 → 3551.82] to yourself
[3551.82 → 3553.36] through our work
[3553.36 → 3553.90] together
[3553.90 → 3555.18] and Lord
[3555.18 → 3556.14] as they come in
[3556.14 → 3557.16] would you help us
[3557.16 → 3559.44] to make a place
[3559.44 → 3559.96] for them
[3559.96 → 3562.02] to welcome them
[3562.02 → 3563.66] to treat them
[3563.66 → 3565.46] as equal members
[3565.46 → 3566.48] as they become
[3566.48 → 3567.40] part of our church
[3567.40 → 3568.94] and
[3568.94 → 3570.40] and too Lord
[3570.40 → 3571.16] as we think about
[3571.16 → 3572.02] the Area family
[3572.02 → 3572.88] as they come
[3572.88 → 3573.94] this Thursday
[3573.94 → 3574.62] Lord facing
[3574.62 → 3575.32] a huge
[3575.32 → 3577.50] a huge change
[3577.50 → 3577.94] Lord I'm sure
[3577.94 → 3578.56] they're excited
[3578.56 → 3580.50] but also there is
[3580.50 → 3581.66] probably some anxiety
[3581.66 → 3582.46] Lord about
[3582.46 → 3583.16] what it would mean
[3583.16 → 3584.28] to live in a completely
[3584.28 → 3585.02] new place
[3585.02 → 3586.86] Lord we ask
[3586.86 → 3588.22] for your
[3588.22 → 3589.02] for your mercy
[3589.02 → 3589.62] upon them
[3589.62 → 3590.62] would you be present
[3590.62 → 3591.16] with them
[3591.16 → 3592.94] Lord would you help us
[3592.94 → 3594.72] to give
[3594.72 → 3596.34] to supply
[3596.34 → 3597.04] their need
[3597.04 → 3598.68] Lord
[3598.68 → 3600.24] especially as a quarantine
[3600.24 → 3600.84] would you
[3600.84 → 3602.04] help them
[3602.04 → 3602.62] and Lord

[3603.70 → 3604.56] welcome them well
[3604.56 → 3606.62] Lord we also

[3610.86 → 3612.24] our other
[3612.24 → 3614.12] immigrant families
[3614.12 → 3614.84] that we have welcomed
[3614.84 → 3615.56] over the years
[3615.56 → 3616.66] continue to help them
[3616.66 → 3617.52] to settle in well

[3619.66 → 3620.64] Lord to
[3620.64 → 3621.84] be a community
[3621.84 → 3622.82] that reflects
[3622.82 → 3625.68] this final picture
[3625.68 → 3626.38] that we see in
[3626.38 → 3627.32] revelation of people
[3627.32 → 3628.34] from every Tong tribe
[3628.34 → 3628.78] and nation
[3628.78 → 3629.98] gathered around the throne
[3629.98 → 3631.26] and worshipping you
[3631.26 → 3632.78] and Lord we also
[3632.78 → 3634.04] think about our own
[3634.04 → 3635.40] church family
[3635.40 → 3636.66] and their needs
[3636.66 → 3637.62] Lord just naming
