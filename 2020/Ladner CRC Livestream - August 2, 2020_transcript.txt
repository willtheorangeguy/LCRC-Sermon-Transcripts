[247.22 --> 248.22]  Good morning to you all.
[248.22 --> 250.22]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[250.22 --> 253.22]  And this is our Sunday morning live stream worship.
[253.22 --> 255.22]  My name is Jason Truel.
[255.22 --> 258.22]  I'll be leading us in worship and giving the sermon.
[258.22 --> 260.22]  And we have Marian Vandriel on piano.
[260.22 --> 264.22]  We have Lorna Hemming and Harry Van Toll who are singing.
[264.22 --> 268.22]  And we have Doug and Michaela in the back doing our audio visual.
[268.22 --> 274.22]  And so we are glad that you have joined us this morning or maybe later in the day.
[274.22 --> 282.22]  And so we are here to worship the Lord and hear now the call to worship.
[282.22 --> 284.22]  And you will see it there on your screen.
[284.22 --> 286.22]  And the second line is bolded.
[286.22 --> 289.22]  And I'll ask you to say it out loud.
[289.22 --> 291.22]  Give praise to the Lord.
[291.22 --> 293.22]  Proclaim his name.
[293.22 --> 298.22]  Make known among the nations what he has done.
[298.22 --> 300.22]  Sing to him.
[300.22 --> 302.22]  Sing praise to him.
[302.22 --> 305.22]  Tell of all his wonderful acts.
[305.22 --> 308.22]  Glory in his holy name.
[308.22 --> 312.22]  Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
[312.22 --> 316.22]  Look to the Lord and his strength.
[316.22 --> 319.22]  Seek his face always.
[319.22 --> 322.22]  Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[322.22 --> 333.22]  Our great God and our heavenly Father, we fix our eyes on you and look to you as our strength.
[333.22 --> 336.22]  And Lord, we adore you this morning.
[336.22 --> 345.22]  We gaze upon your beauty, O Lord, and we are astonished to find that your eyes are on us, your children.
[345.22 --> 351.22]  You are not distracted taking care of other people and other needs.
[351.22 --> 362.22]  You, in your infinite sovereignty, chose to intimately turn your face upon us, to bless us, and to keep us.
[362.22 --> 376.22]  O Lord, our light and our salvation, we thank you that you invite us to sing your praises and to proclaim your name in the wonderful things that you do among the nations.
[376.22 --> 380.22]  Faithful and loving God, we rejoice in you.
[380.22 --> 383.22]  We pray in your precious name.
[383.22 --> 384.22]  Amen.
[384.22 --> 390.22]  So please join us and let's sing together these songs of praise.
[390.22 --> 391.22]  Praise.
[391.22 --> 410.22]  The splendor of the King.
[410.22 --> 419.02]  Let all the earth rejoice, let all the earth rejoice.
[419.02 --> 433.82]  He wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide, and trembles at his voice, and trembles at his voice.
[433.82 --> 452.48]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all who sing, how great, how great is our God.
[452.48 --> 468.30]  From age to age he stands, and time is in his hands, beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
[468.30 --> 482.30]  The Godhead's reign in wine, Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
[482.30 --> 500.30]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all who sing, how great, how great is our God.
[500.30 --> 519.30]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[519.30 --> 538.30]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[538.30 --> 555.30]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all who sing, how great, how great is our God.
[568.30 --> 598.28]  He is the Lord, forever is true.
[598.30 --> 628.28]  He is the Lord, forever is true.
[628.30 --> 630.30]  He is the Lord, forever is true.
[630.30 --> 658.28]  He is the Lord, forever is true.
[658.28 --> 660.28]  He is excited,还 trouvé, we are light.
[660.28 --> 665.28]  He is exalted, the King is exalted, come on high.
[665.28 --> 695.26]  The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not run.
[695.28 --> 700.28]  He makes me lie in pastures green.
[701.36 --> 706.48]  He leads me by the still, still waters.
[707.38 --> 711.28]  His goodness restores my soul.
[712.08 --> 716.28]  And I will trust in you alone.
[717.14 --> 721.72]  And I will trust in you alone.
[721.72 --> 727.72]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[728.66 --> 732.72]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[734.64 --> 739.56]  He guides my grace in righteousness.
[739.56 --> 745.64]  And he unlocks my life with blood.
[746.50 --> 751.72]  And my cup it overflows with joy.
[752.18 --> 755.56]  I've faced on his pure delight.
[755.56 --> 760.56]  And I will trust in you alone.
[761.50 --> 765.56]  And I will trust in you alone.
[766.84 --> 771.56]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[772.64 --> 776.56]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[776.56 --> 784.56]  And though I walk the darkest path.
[784.90 --> 788.56]  I will not feel the evil one.
[788.56 --> 789.56]  For your love is mine.
[789.56 --> 790.56]  For your love is mine.
[790.56 --> 794.56]  For your love is mine.
[794.56 --> 795.56]  And though I walk the darkest path.
[795.56 --> 799.56]  And the comfort I need to know.
[799.56 --> 804.56]  And I will trust in you alone.
[804.56 --> 809.56]  And I will trust in you alone.
[809.56 --> 811.56]  For your goodness will lead me home.
[811.56 --> 820.56]  And your goodness will lead me home.
[820.56 --> 822.56]  For your loved ones will lead me home.
[822.56 --> 823.56]  For your love is mine.
[823.56 --> 824.56]  For your love is mine.
[824.56 --> 826.56]  For your grace will lead me home.
[826.56 --> 828.56]  For your grace will lead me home.
[830.04 --> 833.54]  So we continue to worship our Lord this morning.
[833.54 --> 835.50]  In a time of confession.
[835.98 --> 836.56]  And then assurance.
[837.56 --> 839.78]  As we come before the Lord.
[839.86 --> 841.00]  Because he calls us.
[841.62 --> 843.50]  And we turn our hearts.
[843.66 --> 845.90]  And our attention towards him in worship.
[846.30 --> 849.52]  It leads us to see his glory.
[849.52 --> 852.56]  but then also to see how we fall short.
[853.86 --> 859.60]  And so this time of confession is not a time where we kind of just wallow in our sin,
[859.72 --> 862.36]  but rather it's a time to be renewed by grace.
[863.30 --> 865.54]  And so please pray with me in this prayer of confession.
[867.70 --> 874.96]  Lord, we confess that in our weakness, instead of seeking you, we have sought our own way.
[874.96 --> 882.06]  We have relied on our own devices, and we have turned against you in thought, word, and deed,
[882.54 --> 886.08]  in the things we have done, but also in the things we have not done,
[886.36 --> 891.82]  that would have been loving to our families and our neighbors, and ultimately to you.
[893.14 --> 896.66]  And so the psalmist leads us in praying, saying,
[896.82 --> 902.48]  Turn to me and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name.
[902.48 --> 906.16]  Direct my footsteps according to your word.
[906.84 --> 909.70]  Let no sin rule over me.
[911.16 --> 917.22]  And so please, I invite you to take a moment to acknowledge these things silently before the Lord,
[917.74 --> 921.32]  knowing that forgiveness is freely available in Jesus.
[932.48 --> 941.22]  Receive now the good news.
[941.96 --> 948.18]  Our greatest need that we could never accomplish on our own has been met in Jesus Christ.
[949.22 --> 950.30]  Romans 8 says,
[950.30 --> 955.38]  He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all,
[956.04 --> 960.20]  how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
[961.26 --> 965.40]  Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,
[966.72 --> 970.14]  neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[971.04 --> 974.10]  neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
[974.10 --> 979.68]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[980.64 --> 985.36]  So brothers and sisters, know that you are forgiven, and be at peace.
[986.02 --> 989.12]  And let's all say together, thanks be to God.
[989.54 --> 990.30]  Thanks be to God.
[990.70 --> 992.26]  So let's sing our song of renewal.
[992.26 --> 1015.48]  Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
[1015.48 --> 1021.56]  grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt.
[1021.56 --> 1027.66]  Yonder on Calvary's mount of horn,
[1028.18 --> 1034.00]  there where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.
[1034.00 --> 1040.34]  God is His grace, God is His grace,
[1040.34 --> 1046.40]  grace that will pardon and cleanse within.
[1046.96 --> 1052.74]  God is His grace, God is His grace,
[1052.74 --> 1058.74]  grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1058.74 --> 1064.52]  God is His grace, God is His grace, God is His grace,
[1064.52 --> 1067.12]  God is His grace, God is His grace, God is His grace.
[1067.12 --> 1072.42]  What can I fail to wash it away?
[1072.42 --> 1078.76]  Look, there is glowing out great Islant High,
[1078.76 --> 1084.74]  Whiter than snow you may be today
[1084.74 --> 1091.10]  Nor is grace, infinite grace
[1091.10 --> 1097.10]  Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
[1097.10 --> 1103.50]  Nor is grace, infinite grace
[1103.50 --> 1110.06]  Grace that is greater than all our sin
[1110.06 --> 1117.40]  Marvelous, infinite, malicious grace
[1117.40 --> 1123.48]  Freely bestowed on all who believe
[1123.48 --> 1129.58]  Knew that our longing to see His face
[1129.58 --> 1135.64]  With this moment His grace, grace sing
[1135.64 --> 1141.98]  Grace, infinite grace
[1141.98 --> 1147.82]  Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
[1147.82 --> 1153.58]  Nor is grace, infinite grace
[1153.58 --> 1160.64]  Grace that is greater than all our sin
[1160.64 --> 1171.88]  Good morning again to you all. It was really great to have Pastor Gary Rosema with us the last two weeks
[1171.88 --> 1175.40]  leading us on a study of Elisha.
[1176.14 --> 1180.36]  And today we will return to our sermon series in the book of Acts
[1180.36 --> 1185.90]  that we are in the summer, in the fall, and up until the season of Advent
[1185.90 --> 1190.92]  And we're making our way through this sermon series that we're calling The Church in Movement
[1190.92 --> 1198.70]  So Acts, the book we're in, is the book in the New Testament that follows the four Gospels
[1198.70 --> 1203.42]  And it tells the story of what Jesus continued to do
[1203.42 --> 1205.70]  After His life, death, and resurrection
[1205.70 --> 1211.76]  What Jesus continued to do in and through and among His earliest disciples
[1211.76 --> 1215.24]  You know, and so Acts is really an account
[1215.24 --> 1220.86]  Of the first 30 years of gospel transformation on earth
[1220.86 --> 1224.92]  And about this community that was forming around the gospel
[1224.92 --> 1226.52]  Called the church
[1226.52 --> 1229.44]  And so, so far in the series
[1229.44 --> 1231.44]  We've spent five weeks already
[1231.44 --> 1233.24]  In chapters 1 and 2 of Acts
[1233.24 --> 1236.52]  And today we will be looking at chapter 3
[1236.52 --> 1242.16]  Sorry, hold on
[1242.16 --> 1249.12]  Technical difficulty
[1249.12 --> 1259.72]  I wish I could pause
[1259.72 --> 1261.42]  I guess you can
[1261.42 --> 1262.60]  I don't know if you can pause
[1262.60 --> 1273.60]  Okay, there we go
[1273.60 --> 1274.88]  Okay
[1274.88 --> 1277.40]  So I'm sorry about that
[1277.40 --> 1279.42]  So we're in chapter 3
[1279.42 --> 1281.56]  And the passage that we're looking at today
[1281.56 --> 1287.26]  Is one of the first public acts of ministry in the Christian church
[1287.26 --> 1290.80]  And so for that reason, it's a great place to look
[1290.80 --> 1293.00]  To see what the Christian church, us
[1293.00 --> 1296.06]  What are we supposed to be doing in the world?
[1296.86 --> 1298.08]  Okay, so let's take a look
[1298.08 --> 1301.38]  And we're in Acts chapter 3, verses 1 to 21
[1301.38 --> 1304.56]  We'll have the scripture on the screen for us
[1304.56 --> 1307.68]  And so please give your attention to the reading of God's word
[1307.68 --> 1312.54]  One day, Peter and John were going up to the temple
[1312.54 --> 1314.28]  At the time of prayer
[1314.28 --> 1316.22]  At 3 in the afternoon
[1316.22 --> 1319.58]  Now a man who was lame from birth
[1319.58 --> 1322.24]  Was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful
[1322.24 --> 1324.44]  Where he was put every day
[1324.44 --> 1327.44]  To beg from those going into the temple courts
[1327.44 --> 1331.08]  When he saw Peter and John about to enter
[1331.08 --> 1332.70]  He asked them for money
[1332.70 --> 1335.18]  Peter looked straight at him
[1335.18 --> 1336.22]  As did John
[1336.22 --> 1337.78]  Then Peter said
[1337.78 --> 1339.10]  Look at us
[1339.10 --> 1341.66]  So the man gave them his attention
[1341.66 --> 1343.56]  Expecting to get something from them
[1343.56 --> 1345.74]  Then Peter said
[1345.74 --> 1348.70]  Silver or gold I do not have
[1348.70 --> 1351.36]  But what I do have I give you
[1351.36 --> 1354.60]  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1354.60 --> 1355.60]  Walk
[1355.60 --> 1358.16]  Taking him by the right hand
[1358.16 --> 1359.04]  He helped him up
[1359.04 --> 1362.74]  And instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong
[1362.74 --> 1366.02]  He jumped to his feet and began to walk
[1366.02 --> 1369.12]  Then he went with them into the temple courts
[1369.12 --> 1371.14]  Walking and jumping and praising God
[1371.14 --> 1374.40]  When all the people saw him walking and praising God
[1374.40 --> 1377.94]  They recognized him as the same man
[1377.94 --> 1380.26]  Who used to sit begging at the temple gate
[1380.26 --> 1380.90]  Called Beautiful
[1380.90 --> 1384.14]  And they were filled with wonder and amazement
[1384.14 --> 1385.78]  At what had happened to him
[1385.78 --> 1389.64]  While the man held on to Peter and John
[1389.64 --> 1391.32]  All the people were astonished
[1391.32 --> 1393.54]  And came running to them in the place
[1393.54 --> 1395.04]  Called Solomon's Colonnade
[1395.04 --> 1397.78]  When Peter saw this
[1397.78 --> 1398.98]  He said to them
[1398.98 --> 1400.64]  Fellow Israelites
[1400.64 --> 1402.62]  Why does this surprise you?
[1402.88 --> 1404.08]  Why do you stare at us?
[1404.24 --> 1406.46]  As if by our own power or godliness
[1406.46 --> 1408.40]  We made this man walk
[1408.40 --> 1411.36]  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[1411.36 --> 1413.06]  The God of our fathers
[1413.06 --> 1414.96]  Has glorified his servant Jesus
[1414.96 --> 1417.78]  You handed him over to be killed
[1417.78 --> 1420.44]  You disowned him before Pilate
[1420.44 --> 1422.44]  Though he had decided to let him go
[1422.44 --> 1425.72]  You disowned the holy and righteous one
[1425.72 --> 1428.38]  And asked that a murderer be released to you
[1428.38 --> 1431.64]  You killed the author of life
[1431.64 --> 1434.38]  But God raised him from the dead
[1434.38 --> 1436.46]  We are witnesses of this
[1436.46 --> 1439.00]  By faith in the name of Jesus
[1439.00 --> 1441.04]  This man whom you see and know
[1441.04 --> 1442.38]  Was made strong
[1442.38 --> 1444.16]  It is Jesus' name
[1444.16 --> 1446.28]  And the faith that comes through him
[1446.28 --> 1448.20]  That has completely healed him
[1448.20 --> 1449.60]  As you can all see
[1449.60 --> 1452.60]  Now, fellow Israelites
[1452.60 --> 1454.88]  I know that you acted in ignorance
[1454.88 --> 1456.18]  As did your leaders
[1456.18 --> 1458.28]  But this is how God fulfilled
[1458.28 --> 1459.84]  What he had foretold
[1459.84 --> 1461.12]  Through all the prophets
[1461.12 --> 1464.08]  Saying that his Messiah would suffer
[1464.08 --> 1466.46]  Repent then
[1466.46 --> 1467.52]  And turn to God
[1467.52 --> 1469.86]  So that your sins may be wiped out
[1469.86 --> 1471.64]  That times of refreshing
[1471.64 --> 1472.98]  May come from the Lord
[1472.98 --> 1475.76]  And that he may send the Messiah
[1475.76 --> 1478.62]  Who has been appointed for you
[1478.62 --> 1480.66]  Even Jesus
[1480.66 --> 1483.62]  Heaven must receive him
[1483.62 --> 1484.74]  Until the time comes
[1484.74 --> 1486.12]  For God to restore everything
[1486.12 --> 1488.10]  As he promised long ago
[1488.10 --> 1489.74]  Through his holy prophets
[1489.74 --> 1493.58]  So this is the word of the Lord
[1493.58 --> 1495.84]  Thanks be to God
[1495.84 --> 1499.72]  So let's begin with a word of prayer
[1499.72 --> 1504.60]  Our Father, we come to you this morning
[1504.60 --> 1507.16]  We thank you for your word
[1507.16 --> 1508.94]  When everything else in life
[1508.94 --> 1510.76]  Is unstable, uncertain
[1510.76 --> 1514.28]  Lord, your word is true and solid
[1514.28 --> 1516.74]  Because you are the everlasting God
[1516.74 --> 1518.80]  And so we come to you
[1518.80 --> 1519.66]  And look to you
[1519.66 --> 1521.42]  And we ask that you would
[1521.42 --> 1522.54]  Help us to follow you
[1522.54 --> 1524.00]  To learn your heart
[1524.00 --> 1526.00]  To know your will for us
[1526.00 --> 1527.70]  And what it means for us
[1527.70 --> 1528.62]  To be the church
[1528.62 --> 1529.86]  And following you
[1529.86 --> 1531.12]  We pray in Jesus' name
[1531.12 --> 1531.94]  Amen
[1531.94 --> 1534.66]  So I want to begin by sharing
[1534.66 --> 1536.90]  A photo with you
[1536.90 --> 1539.84]  There it is
[1539.84 --> 1542.28]  It's not a very good photo
[1542.28 --> 1543.12]  As you can see
[1543.12 --> 1544.62]  It was kind of capturing a moment
[1544.62 --> 1547.40]  And so we were in Taiwan
[1547.40 --> 1549.88]  And my youngest
[1549.88 --> 1550.68]  The kid there
[1550.68 --> 1552.04]  Is my youngest daughter Gabby
[1552.04 --> 1553.80]  And she could just barely walk
[1553.80 --> 1554.54]  So she's you know
[1554.54 --> 1555.68]  One, one and a half
[1555.68 --> 1559.08]  And there I am
[1559.08 --> 1559.86]  On the right
[1559.86 --> 1561.76]  And heading out the door
[1561.76 --> 1562.50]  To go to work
[1562.50 --> 1564.04]  And there's my daughter
[1564.04 --> 1564.60]  She you know
[1564.60 --> 1566.02]  She's got in her shoes
[1566.02 --> 1566.96]  And she's holding them
[1566.96 --> 1568.68]  And looking up at me
[1568.68 --> 1571.14]  And crushed
[1571.14 --> 1572.22]  Heartbroken
[1572.22 --> 1573.94]  Because I'm telling her
[1573.94 --> 1574.96]  She has to stay home
[1574.96 --> 1576.42]  That she can't
[1576.42 --> 1578.02]  Come with me to work
[1578.02 --> 1581.10]  And still today
[1581.10 --> 1583.62]  She loves to come with me
[1583.62 --> 1585.50]  Whenever I leave the house
[1585.50 --> 1587.14]  And so whenever
[1587.14 --> 1588.38]  I need to leave
[1588.38 --> 1590.22]  I try to
[1590.22 --> 1590.86]  You know
[1590.86 --> 1592.04]  Get put on my shoes
[1592.04 --> 1593.20]  And be very quiet
[1593.20 --> 1595.40]  And as soon as
[1595.40 --> 1596.18]  I put my hand
[1596.18 --> 1597.12]  On the doorknob
[1597.12 --> 1598.10]  Wherever she is
[1598.10 --> 1598.70]  In the house
[1598.70 --> 1599.92]  I hear her
[1599.92 --> 1600.44]  You know
[1600.44 --> 1601.34]  Yell out
[1601.34 --> 1603.14]  Dad where are you going
[1603.14 --> 1604.10]  Can I come
[1604.10 --> 1605.60]  It doesn't matter
[1605.60 --> 1605.86]  You know
[1605.86 --> 1606.58]  If she's in her bedroom
[1606.58 --> 1607.16]  In the kitchen
[1607.16 --> 1608.08]  Wherever she is
[1608.08 --> 1610.98]  And she so loves
[1610.98 --> 1611.62]  To come with me
[1611.62 --> 1612.28]  And Gabby
[1612.28 --> 1613.46]  I'm so glad
[1613.46 --> 1614.34]  You like to come with me
[1614.34 --> 1616.16]  But here's why
[1616.16 --> 1617.14]  I'm telling you this
[1617.14 --> 1618.52]  As we study
[1618.52 --> 1619.72]  The book of Acts together
[1619.72 --> 1620.48]  We're taking up
[1620.48 --> 1621.06]  This question
[1621.06 --> 1622.24]  Of what does it mean
[1622.24 --> 1622.94]  For us to be
[1622.94 --> 1623.80]  The church on mission
[1623.80 --> 1625.68]  The gospel
[1625.68 --> 1628.20]  That we as Christians
[1628.20 --> 1629.70]  Proclaim and believe
[1629.70 --> 1630.88]  Is this
[1630.88 --> 1632.32]  That in Jesus Christ
[1632.32 --> 1633.10]  God is making
[1633.10 --> 1633.90]  All things new
[1633.90 --> 1635.74]  That in Jesus Christ
[1635.74 --> 1636.62]  God is making
[1636.62 --> 1637.44]  All things new
[1637.44 --> 1638.18]  That's the gospel
[1638.18 --> 1640.20]  And so what does this mean
[1640.20 --> 1641.46]  That Jesus is making
[1641.46 --> 1642.80]  All things new
[1642.80 --> 1644.74]  It means that Jesus came
[1644.74 --> 1647.28]  To bring his salvation
[1647.28 --> 1648.78]  By restoring us
[1648.78 --> 1649.80]  To God
[1649.80 --> 1651.78]  But also that he is
[1651.78 --> 1653.14]  Restoring the world
[1653.14 --> 1654.46]  In every way
[1654.46 --> 1655.38]  That has been broken
[1655.38 --> 1656.02]  By sin
[1656.02 --> 1657.32]  So not only
[1657.32 --> 1658.66]  In Christ's salvation
[1658.66 --> 1659.88]  Did he come to restore us
[1659.88 --> 1660.48]  To God
[1660.48 --> 1661.50]  But also
[1661.50 --> 1662.90]  To restore us
[1662.90 --> 1663.42]  In relationship
[1663.42 --> 1664.20]  To ourselves
[1664.20 --> 1664.98]  And that's what he does
[1664.98 --> 1665.84]  Through sanctification
[1665.84 --> 1667.78]  But also to restore us
[1667.78 --> 1668.66]  To one another
[1668.66 --> 1670.56]  That is the church
[1670.56 --> 1671.84]  And then also
[1671.84 --> 1672.60]  To ultimately
[1672.60 --> 1673.82]  Restore the world
[1673.82 --> 1674.60]  That he created
[1674.60 --> 1675.44]  In his goodness
[1675.44 --> 1676.72]  To us
[1676.72 --> 1677.30]  As a gift
[1677.30 --> 1678.54]  That we would steward it well
[1678.54 --> 1681.92]  That is the entire scope
[1681.92 --> 1683.00]  Of Jesus' mission
[1683.00 --> 1684.04]  And so what does this mean
[1684.04 --> 1684.60]  For us?
[1685.28 --> 1686.74]  What is the church's mission?
[1686.74 --> 1689.52]  And when I say the church
[1689.52 --> 1691.54]  I mean both
[1691.54 --> 1693.10]  That global body
[1693.10 --> 1694.08]  That is spread throughout
[1694.08 --> 1695.36]  All of time and space
[1695.36 --> 1696.96]  And I also mean
[1696.96 --> 1698.16]  Local expressions
[1698.16 --> 1699.54]  Of that body
[1699.54 --> 1700.90]  Like Latin or CRC
[1700.90 --> 1702.74]  And when I say
[1702.74 --> 1703.68]  The church's mission
[1703.68 --> 1705.12]  I mean specifically
[1705.12 --> 1707.02]  Our ministry out in the world
[1707.02 --> 1708.96]  The work that we do
[1708.96 --> 1711.22]  Outside the church
[1711.22 --> 1713.36]  And so when we talk about
[1713.36 --> 1714.68]  The mission of the church
[1714.68 --> 1716.52]  What is it that this global
[1716.52 --> 1717.76]  And local church
[1717.76 --> 1719.10]  Is supposed to be doing
[1719.10 --> 1720.06]  Out in the world?
[1720.98 --> 1721.76]  And basically
[1721.76 --> 1722.92]  I want to suggest to us
[1722.92 --> 1723.48]  This morning
[1723.48 --> 1724.24]  Very simply
[1724.24 --> 1726.16]  That the Bible teaches
[1726.16 --> 1728.04]  That we are to
[1728.04 --> 1729.00]  Imitate Jesus
[1729.00 --> 1730.88]  That just as
[1730.88 --> 1731.96]  He brings
[1731.96 --> 1733.40]  His restoring power
[1733.40 --> 1734.80]  To every part of creation
[1734.80 --> 1736.98]  So we are to seek
[1736.98 --> 1737.48]  To bring
[1737.48 --> 1738.56]  His restoring power
[1738.56 --> 1739.74]  To every part of creation
[1739.74 --> 1741.34]  And that just as
[1741.34 --> 1742.22]  He seeks
[1742.22 --> 1743.94]  As this passage says
[1743.94 --> 1744.70]  In other places
[1744.70 --> 1745.26]  In the Bible
[1745.26 --> 1746.48]  They say that
[1746.48 --> 1747.12]  He is seeking
[1747.12 --> 1748.26]  To make all things new
[1748.26 --> 1750.44]  So are we also
[1750.44 --> 1752.06]  To seek to make
[1752.06 --> 1753.24]  All things new
[1753.24 --> 1754.40]  In him
[1754.40 --> 1756.14]  In other words
[1756.14 --> 1756.94]  The way the church
[1756.94 --> 1757.54]  Is to understand
[1757.54 --> 1758.22]  His mission
[1758.22 --> 1759.34]  Is in reference
[1759.34 --> 1760.44]  To Jesus' mission
[1760.44 --> 1762.24]  And in imitation
[1762.24 --> 1763.32]  Of it
[1763.32 --> 1765.74]  So Jesus is not
[1765.74 --> 1766.46]  Here physically
[1766.46 --> 1767.74]  He ascended to heaven
[1767.74 --> 1768.78]  We saw that
[1768.78 --> 1770.14]  In Acts chapter 1
[1770.14 --> 1772.08]  But in Acts chapter 2
[1772.08 --> 1772.72]  We saw that
[1772.72 --> 1773.76]  He sent his spirit
[1773.76 --> 1775.64]  Into the church
[1775.64 --> 1777.96]  And as the church
[1777.96 --> 1778.94]  We want to
[1778.94 --> 1780.92]  Head out the door
[1780.92 --> 1781.94]  With Jesus
[1781.94 --> 1783.98]  We want to come along
[1783.98 --> 1784.88]  And be with him
[1784.88 --> 1786.22]  And to do what he does
[1786.22 --> 1788.12]  Wherever he goes
[1788.12 --> 1789.96]  And while I
[1789.96 --> 1791.20]  Sometimes
[1791.20 --> 1793.04]  Because I'm in a rush
[1793.04 --> 1794.72]  Or just don't want to bother
[1794.72 --> 1796.90]  I like to sneak out the door
[1796.90 --> 1798.12]  Unnoticed sometimes
[1798.12 --> 1798.98]  God
[1798.98 --> 1800.56]  Always
[1800.56 --> 1801.60]  Invites
[1801.60 --> 1802.32]  Us
[1802.32 --> 1804.20]  And not only
[1804.20 --> 1805.26]  Invites us
[1805.26 --> 1806.84]  But compels us
[1806.84 --> 1807.48]  To go
[1807.48 --> 1810.12]  So in our passage today
[1810.12 --> 1811.74]  In Acts chapter 3
[1811.74 --> 1813.36]  We see the church
[1813.36 --> 1814.22]  Doing just that
[1814.22 --> 1815.82]  And I think we begin
[1815.82 --> 1816.50]  To see this
[1816.50 --> 1817.50]  This Christ
[1817.50 --> 1818.74]  Imitating pattern
[1818.74 --> 1819.56]  Of mission
[1819.56 --> 1821.22]  Begin to emerge
[1821.22 --> 1821.82]  Here
[1821.82 --> 1824.20]  So what is the church's mission
[1824.20 --> 1826.08]  And today I want to talk about it
[1826.08 --> 1826.82]  In two ways
[1826.82 --> 1828.56]  That come from this text
[1828.56 --> 1829.56]  And it's pretty straightforward
[1829.56 --> 1830.72]  First
[1830.72 --> 1832.28]  Our mission is to
[1832.28 --> 1833.80]  Extend the healing hand
[1833.80 --> 1835.26]  And second
[1835.26 --> 1836.34]  Is to proclaim
[1836.34 --> 1837.16]  The saving word
[1837.16 --> 1838.86]  So it's to
[1838.86 --> 1840.50]  Extend the healing hand
[1840.50 --> 1841.94]  And to proclaim
[1841.94 --> 1843.06]  The saving word
[1843.06 --> 1845.34]  So first
[1845.34 --> 1846.48]  What does it mean
[1846.48 --> 1848.02]  For us as the church
[1848.02 --> 1848.66]  And our mission
[1848.66 --> 1850.80]  To extend the healing hand
[1850.80 --> 1853.04]  And I believe
[1853.04 --> 1853.70]  That this passage
[1853.70 --> 1854.64]  Teach us
[1854.64 --> 1855.58]  What it means
[1855.58 --> 1856.78]  To extend the healing hand
[1856.78 --> 1858.16]  Is to bring healing
[1858.16 --> 1859.86]  To the material needs
[1859.86 --> 1860.52]  Of our neighbors
[1860.52 --> 1861.98]  Whether that need
[1861.98 --> 1862.92]  Is physical
[1862.92 --> 1864.54]  Whether it is
[1864.54 --> 1866.04]  Relational
[1866.04 --> 1867.76]  Whether it is economic
[1867.76 --> 1869.50]  And this is actually
[1869.50 --> 1870.12]  What you see
[1870.12 --> 1870.76]  In the first half
[1870.76 --> 1871.38]  Of this passage
[1871.38 --> 1874.22]  And we see this happening
[1874.22 --> 1875.40]  In a few ways
[1875.40 --> 1876.04]  It's kind of
[1876.04 --> 1876.92]  A progression
[1876.92 --> 1878.70]  So first
[1878.70 --> 1879.20]  You see it
[1879.20 --> 1879.76]  With the church
[1879.76 --> 1881.08]  Moving into the world
[1881.08 --> 1882.42]  And so maybe
[1882.42 --> 1883.16]  You notice that
[1883.16 --> 1884.26]  In verses 1 to 3
[1884.26 --> 1885.60]  So you've got
[1885.60 --> 1886.78]  Peter and John
[1886.78 --> 1889.20]  And they're moving
[1889.20 --> 1890.82]  They're moving there
[1890.82 --> 1892.88]  And it's a small detail
[1892.88 --> 1894.60]  But it's really important
[1894.60 --> 1895.94]  So if you think back
[1895.94 --> 1897.78]  To Acts chapter 1
[1897.78 --> 1899.18]  Which we looked at
[1899.18 --> 1900.10]  A few weeks ago
[1900.10 --> 1902.80]  Where was the church then?
[1902.80 --> 1904.90]  And the main place
[1904.90 --> 1906.68]  That you saw the church
[1906.68 --> 1907.82]  As we looked at it
[1907.82 --> 1908.20]  Is that
[1908.20 --> 1909.40]  They were in a room
[1909.40 --> 1911.56]  They were waiting
[1911.56 --> 1912.86]  For the Holy Spirit
[1912.86 --> 1913.60]  To come
[1913.60 --> 1914.48]  In fear
[1914.48 --> 1915.46]  In anticipation
[1915.46 --> 1916.90]  Not knowing what's going to happen
[1916.90 --> 1918.34]  Huddled in a room together
[1918.34 --> 1918.94]  And praying
[1918.94 --> 1920.82]  But when the Spirit
[1920.82 --> 1921.60]  Does come
[1921.60 --> 1922.28]  To the church
[1922.28 --> 1923.24]  In Acts chapter 2
[1923.24 --> 1924.48]  What he does
[1924.48 --> 1925.96]  Is he drives the church
[1925.96 --> 1926.76]  Out
[1926.76 --> 1928.44]  Into public ministry
[1928.44 --> 1929.68]  Into the world
[1929.68 --> 1931.58]  And so it's really significant
[1931.58 --> 1934.02]  That Peter and John
[1934.02 --> 1935.22]  In this passage
[1935.22 --> 1936.52]  Are not in a room
[1936.52 --> 1938.06]  But they're making their way
[1938.06 --> 1939.00]  Out in the world
[1939.00 --> 1940.82]  And as they go out
[1940.82 --> 1941.62]  Into the world
[1941.62 --> 1943.44]  Do you know what they're doing?
[1944.30 --> 1945.88]  They're imitating Jesus
[1945.88 --> 1947.18]  Right?
[1947.40 --> 1948.60]  Just as Jesus
[1948.60 --> 1950.96]  In his incarnation
[1950.96 --> 1953.54]  Moved into our lives
[1953.54 --> 1955.82]  You know he didn't stay in heaven
[1955.82 --> 1957.48]  But he came into our world
[1957.48 --> 1959.02]  So now by the Spirit
[1959.02 --> 1960.08]  He moves his church
[1960.08 --> 1962.40]  Out into the lives of others
[1962.40 --> 1963.56]  To be incarnate
[1963.56 --> 1964.78]  Into the world
[1964.78 --> 1967.04]  And that movement
[1967.04 --> 1969.06]  Is really the story
[1969.06 --> 1970.32]  Of the book of Acts
[1970.32 --> 1973.04]  And the reason this is so important
[1973.04 --> 1974.68]  And the reason we don't want to
[1974.68 --> 1975.52]  Just kind of jump over
[1975.52 --> 1976.58]  These first couple verses
[1976.58 --> 1977.82]  Is that
[1977.82 --> 1979.66]  This very ordinary movement
[1979.66 --> 1981.42]  Out into the world
[1981.42 --> 1983.72]  Is where healing happens
[1983.72 --> 1985.06]  So just
[1985.06 --> 1986.54]  The ordinary places
[1986.54 --> 1987.74]  That we go
[1987.74 --> 1989.16]  The ordinary things
[1989.16 --> 1989.84]  That we do
[1989.84 --> 1990.82]  Out in the world
[1990.82 --> 1991.94]  That we encounter
[1991.94 --> 1992.62]  Throughout our day
[1992.62 --> 1993.72]  That's the context
[1993.72 --> 1994.86]  In which
[1994.86 --> 1996.64]  We extend the healing hand
[1996.64 --> 1997.28]  To the world
[1997.28 --> 1999.36]  So you see them
[1999.36 --> 2000.46]  Moving into the world
[2000.46 --> 2001.56]  Second
[2001.56 --> 2002.78]  You see them
[2002.78 --> 2004.16]  Recognizing its needs
[2004.16 --> 2005.78]  When they move
[2005.78 --> 2006.64]  Into the world
[2006.64 --> 2007.62]  They're not
[2007.62 --> 2008.36]  They don't have
[2008.36 --> 2009.12]  Their heads down
[2009.12 --> 2009.66]  They're not looking
[2009.66 --> 2010.94]  Straight to the ground
[2010.94 --> 2011.76]  But
[2011.76 --> 2013.24]  You know
[2013.24 --> 2014.12]  They're not blind
[2014.12 --> 2015.96]  To what's going on
[2015.96 --> 2016.48]  Around them
[2016.48 --> 2016.90]  But rather
[2016.90 --> 2017.94]  They recognize
[2017.94 --> 2019.36]  What is happening
[2019.36 --> 2021.06]  And we see this
[2021.06 --> 2022.24]  In verses 4 and 5
[2022.24 --> 2023.70]  It says
[2023.70 --> 2024.94]  Peter
[2024.94 --> 2026.04]  Looked
[2026.04 --> 2027.08]  Talking about
[2027.08 --> 2028.00]  The layman
[2028.00 --> 2028.58]  Peter looked
[2028.58 --> 2029.58]  Straight at him
[2029.58 --> 2030.56]  As did
[2030.56 --> 2031.38]  As did John
[2031.38 --> 2033.04]  Then Peter said
[2033.04 --> 2034.28]  Look at us
[2034.28 --> 2035.74]  So the man
[2035.74 --> 2036.34]  Gave them
[2036.34 --> 2037.02]  His attention
[2037.02 --> 2038.10]  Expecting to get
[2038.10 --> 2038.48]  Something
[2038.48 --> 2039.56]  From them
[2039.56 --> 2040.62]  Right
[2040.62 --> 2041.16]  So this is
[2041.16 --> 2041.52]  Kind of this
[2041.52 --> 2042.30]  Intense moment
[2042.30 --> 2042.60]  Here
[2042.60 --> 2044.52]  And you know
[2044.52 --> 2045.52]  Peter and John
[2045.52 --> 2046.54]  Called them in
[2046.54 --> 2047.62]  They see him
[2047.62 --> 2048.26]  They look straight
[2048.26 --> 2048.68]  At him
[2048.68 --> 2049.24]  They said
[2049.24 --> 2050.18]  Look at us
[2050.18 --> 2050.52]  And there's
[2050.52 --> 2051.28]  This exchange
[2051.28 --> 2051.98]  This moment
[2051.98 --> 2055.08]  And this language
[2055.08 --> 2056.36]  Of looking straight
[2056.36 --> 2057.24]  At him
[2057.24 --> 2058.44]  Is really interesting
[2058.44 --> 2059.66]  Because Peter
[2059.66 --> 2060.36]  Shows us
[2060.36 --> 2060.80]  In this very
[2060.80 --> 2061.94]  Kind of vivid way
[2061.94 --> 2063.56]  That he recognizes
[2063.56 --> 2064.36]  This man
[2064.36 --> 2065.32]  And he sees
[2065.32 --> 2065.98]  His needs
[2065.98 --> 2067.36]  And in this
[2067.36 --> 2068.36]  Moment of recognition
[2068.36 --> 2069.78]  When he
[2069.78 --> 2070.66]  He looks at him
[2070.66 --> 2071.50]  And he sees him
[2071.50 --> 2072.22]  He recognizes
[2072.22 --> 2073.04]  A few different
[2073.04 --> 2073.52]  Things
[2073.52 --> 2076.48]  First he notices
[2076.48 --> 2078.32]  This man's need
[2078.32 --> 2079.28]  For bodily healing
[2079.28 --> 2080.42]  Because the passage
[2080.42 --> 2081.26]  Tells us that he
[2081.26 --> 2081.88]  Was lame
[2081.88 --> 2083.14]  From birth
[2083.14 --> 2085.44]  He notices
[2085.44 --> 2086.30]  His need
[2086.30 --> 2087.68]  For material
[2087.68 --> 2088.28]  Resources
[2088.28 --> 2089.72]  Because the passage
[2089.72 --> 2090.46]  Tells us
[2090.46 --> 2091.76]  That he's a beggar
[2091.76 --> 2093.74]  He recognizes
[2093.74 --> 2094.34]  His need
[2094.34 --> 2095.40]  For social inclusion
[2095.40 --> 2096.60]  Because he's
[2096.60 --> 2097.60]  This man is not
[2097.60 --> 2098.44]  Going to the temple
[2098.44 --> 2099.16]  Where everyone
[2099.16 --> 2100.06]  Else is going
[2100.06 --> 2100.92]  That's where the
[2100.92 --> 2101.68]  Crowds are going
[2101.68 --> 2102.46]  But rather he's
[2102.46 --> 2104.06]  Outside at the gate
[2104.06 --> 2106.10]  He recognizes
[2106.10 --> 2106.70]  His need
[2106.70 --> 2107.70]  For God's
[2107.70 --> 2108.56]  Presence
[2108.56 --> 2110.04]  Because again
[2110.04 --> 2110.56]  He's sitting
[2110.56 --> 2111.80]  Outside of the temple
[2111.80 --> 2113.24]  Which is the
[2113.24 --> 2114.36]  Symbolic representation
[2114.36 --> 2115.58]  Of God's presence
[2115.58 --> 2116.70]  The temple
[2116.70 --> 2118.10]  Is where you would
[2118.10 --> 2118.94]  Go to worship
[2118.94 --> 2119.48]  God
[2119.48 --> 2120.34]  And this man
[2120.34 --> 2121.44]  Is not doing that
[2121.44 --> 2123.72]  And Peter sees
[2123.72 --> 2125.04]  All of these
[2125.04 --> 2126.38]  Various needs
[2126.38 --> 2127.32]  As he looks
[2127.32 --> 2128.12]  At the man
[2128.12 --> 2129.82]  And friends
[2129.82 --> 2130.52]  Here again
[2130.52 --> 2131.82]  I think Peter
[2131.82 --> 2133.68]  Is imitating Jesus
[2133.68 --> 2135.44]  As Peter
[2135.44 --> 2136.54]  Looks at him
[2136.54 --> 2137.14]  And sees this
[2137.14 --> 2137.94]  Needy and broken
[2137.94 --> 2138.38]  Man
[2138.38 --> 2139.88]  I think he's
[2139.88 --> 2140.58]  Remembering
[2140.58 --> 2141.42]  Another look
[2141.42 --> 2142.50]  Another gaze
[2142.50 --> 2144.10]  That happened
[2144.10 --> 2145.10]  Just weeks before
[2145.10 --> 2146.42]  But this time
[2146.42 --> 2147.58]  It was Jesus
[2147.58 --> 2148.82]  Who looked
[2148.82 --> 2149.88]  Straight at Peter
[2149.88 --> 2151.54]  Remember
[2151.54 --> 2153.02]  After Jesus
[2153.02 --> 2153.80]  Was arrested
[2153.80 --> 2154.32]  In the garden
[2154.32 --> 2155.02]  Of Gethsemane
[2155.02 --> 2155.64]  And brought to
[2155.64 --> 2156.52]  The house of
[2156.52 --> 2157.02]  Caiaphas
[2157.02 --> 2157.74]  The high priest
[2157.74 --> 2158.64]  Of the time
[2158.64 --> 2159.66]  And Peter
[2159.66 --> 2160.70]  Followed behind
[2160.70 --> 2162.30]  And he was there
[2162.30 --> 2163.02]  By the fire
[2163.02 --> 2163.84]  And people said
[2163.84 --> 2164.74]  Hey I know you
[2164.74 --> 2165.54]  And Peter
[2165.54 --> 2167.34]  Denied Jesus
[2167.34 --> 2169.02]  And as he did so
[2169.02 --> 2170.02]  The third time
[2170.02 --> 2170.58]  And the rooster
[2170.58 --> 2171.20]  Crowed
[2171.20 --> 2172.86]  Do you know
[2172.86 --> 2173.40]  What it says
[2173.40 --> 2174.06]  Jesus did
[2174.06 --> 2175.50]  It says
[2175.50 --> 2176.14]  The Lord
[2176.14 --> 2177.22]  Turned
[2177.22 --> 2178.06]  And looked
[2178.06 --> 2179.32]  Straight at Peter
[2179.32 --> 2181.82]  So just as
[2181.82 --> 2182.36]  Jesus
[2182.36 --> 2183.40]  Looked at
[2183.40 --> 2183.92]  Peter
[2183.92 --> 2185.92]  In love
[2185.92 --> 2187.32]  Recognized
[2187.32 --> 2187.88]  His
[2187.88 --> 2189.08]  Need
[2189.08 --> 2190.26]  So now
[2190.26 --> 2190.86]  Peter
[2190.86 --> 2192.16]  In imitation
[2192.16 --> 2192.70]  Of Jesus
[2192.70 --> 2193.32]  Looks at
[2193.32 --> 2193.98]  This man
[2193.98 --> 2195.62]  Recognizes
[2195.62 --> 2196.42]  His need
[2196.42 --> 2196.96]  And loves
[2196.96 --> 2197.22]  Him
[2197.22 --> 2198.88]  And this is
[2198.88 --> 2199.32]  Important
[2199.32 --> 2199.92]  Because not
[2199.92 --> 2201.30]  Only is it
[2201.30 --> 2202.18]  Our presence
[2202.18 --> 2202.66]  Going out
[2202.66 --> 2203.52]  Into the world
[2203.52 --> 2205.48]  But recognition
[2205.48 --> 2206.60]  Is needed
[2206.60 --> 2207.26]  In order to
[2207.26 --> 2207.80]  Bring healing
[2207.80 --> 2208.66]  Into the world
[2208.66 --> 2209.22]  It's not enough
[2209.22 --> 2210.20]  To be there
[2210.20 --> 2211.42]  Because we can be there
[2211.42 --> 2212.16]  In all kinds of
[2212.16 --> 2212.74]  Postures
[2212.74 --> 2214.54]  Of not looking
[2214.54 --> 2216.64]  Of fighting
[2216.64 --> 2217.46]  Different ways
[2217.46 --> 2218.22]  But here
[2218.22 --> 2219.16]  It's to go
[2219.16 --> 2220.30]  And to recognize
[2220.30 --> 2221.12]  The needs
[2221.12 --> 2221.68]  Of the world
[2221.68 --> 2223.52]  So we have to go
[2223.52 --> 2224.14]  And we have to see
[2224.14 --> 2224.70]  Its needs
[2224.70 --> 2225.54]  And then there's
[2225.54 --> 2226.24]  This third
[2226.24 --> 2227.60]  Step
[2227.60 --> 2228.34]  That's taken
[2228.34 --> 2229.30]  Which is to address
[2229.30 --> 2230.02]  Those needs
[2230.02 --> 2230.54]  In faith
[2230.54 --> 2232.14]  So look at
[2232.14 --> 2233.10]  Verse 6
[2233.10 --> 2234.50]  Then Peter
[2234.50 --> 2234.98]  Said
[2234.98 --> 2236.18]  Silver
[2236.18 --> 2237.06]  Or gold
[2237.06 --> 2237.74]  I do not
[2237.74 --> 2238.18]  Have
[2238.18 --> 2239.14]  What I do
[2239.14 --> 2239.56]  Have
[2239.56 --> 2240.02]  I give
[2240.02 --> 2240.50]  To you
[2240.50 --> 2241.70]  In the name
[2241.70 --> 2242.08]  Of Jesus
[2242.08 --> 2242.68]  Christ of
[2242.68 --> 2243.24]  Nazareth
[2243.24 --> 2244.44]  Rise up
[2244.44 --> 2245.24]  And walk
[2245.24 --> 2247.24]  So Peter
[2247.24 --> 2248.06]  Here recognizes
[2248.06 --> 2248.72]  His need
[2248.72 --> 2249.54]  And then he
[2249.54 --> 2250.32]  Actually steps
[2250.32 --> 2251.64]  In to help
[2251.64 --> 2252.40]  Alleviate
[2252.40 --> 2252.88]  The need
[2252.88 --> 2253.74]  That he sees
[2253.74 --> 2255.06]  And in this
[2255.06 --> 2255.42]  Action
[2255.42 --> 2255.88]  What you see
[2255.88 --> 2256.44]  Is that Peter
[2256.44 --> 2256.98]  Was used
[2256.98 --> 2257.46]  By God
[2257.46 --> 2258.08]  To restore
[2258.08 --> 2258.70]  This man
[2258.70 --> 2259.76]  In almost
[2259.76 --> 2260.36]  Every way
[2260.36 --> 2261.82]  So he restores
[2261.82 --> 2262.42]  Him physically
[2262.42 --> 2263.66]  Because now
[2263.66 --> 2264.44]  He is no longer
[2264.44 --> 2264.80]  Lame
[2264.80 --> 2265.82]  He walks
[2265.82 --> 2267.90]  And because of that
[2267.90 --> 2268.54]  He is restored
[2268.54 --> 2269.32]  Economically
[2269.32 --> 2270.24]  Because he now
[2270.24 --> 2270.92]  Can work
[2270.92 --> 2271.80]  And he doesn't
[2271.80 --> 2272.44]  Need to beg
[2272.44 --> 2274.62]  He is restored
[2274.62 --> 2275.34]  Relationally
[2275.34 --> 2276.12]  Because the man
[2276.12 --> 2276.72]  Gets up
[2276.72 --> 2277.32]  And he walks
[2277.32 --> 2278.32]  Into the temple
[2278.32 --> 2279.86]  Where the community
[2279.86 --> 2280.46]  Is
[2280.46 --> 2282.12]  And he is
[2282.12 --> 2283.14]  Restored spiritually
[2283.14 --> 2284.40]  Because what does
[2284.40 --> 2285.18]  The man do
[2285.18 --> 2286.66]  After this happens
[2286.66 --> 2288.42]  It says in verse 8
[2288.42 --> 2289.44]  Walking
[2289.44 --> 2290.30]  And leaping
[2290.30 --> 2290.98]  And praising
[2290.98 --> 2291.44]  God
[2291.44 --> 2292.38]  And all the people
[2292.38 --> 2293.26]  Saw him walking
[2293.26 --> 2294.46]  And praising
[2294.46 --> 2295.08]  God
[2295.08 --> 2297.00]  And so Peter
[2297.00 --> 2298.22]  Addressed the man's
[2298.22 --> 2298.58]  Needs
[2298.58 --> 2300.18]  But notice that
[2300.18 --> 2300.86]  He did it
[2300.86 --> 2301.96]  In faith
[2301.96 --> 2303.44]  He did it in faith
[2303.44 --> 2304.78]  And what does that
[2304.78 --> 2305.08]  Mean
[2305.08 --> 2306.58]  It means that
[2306.58 --> 2307.30]  Peter knows
[2307.30 --> 2308.04]  That even as
[2308.04 --> 2308.96]  He takes action
[2308.96 --> 2309.94]  That he
[2309.94 --> 2311.16]  Himself is not
[2311.16 --> 2312.30]  Sufficient to bring
[2312.30 --> 2313.06]  Any good
[2313.06 --> 2314.04]  To help meet
[2314.04 --> 2314.92]  This man's needs
[2314.92 --> 2316.44]  And when it
[2316.44 --> 2317.18]  Comes to us
[2317.18 --> 2318.04]  Extending this
[2318.04 --> 2318.94]  Healing hand
[2318.94 --> 2319.88]  To people
[2319.88 --> 2320.58]  Around us
[2320.58 --> 2322.20]  I think sometimes
[2322.20 --> 2323.42]  We feel that
[2323.42 --> 2324.80]  We can't meet
[2324.80 --> 2325.32]  The needs
[2325.32 --> 2326.50]  Around us
[2326.50 --> 2327.98]  That we don't
[2327.98 --> 2328.66]  Know what we're
[2328.66 --> 2328.96]  Doing
[2328.96 --> 2330.14]  We
[2330.14 --> 2331.20]  Needs are so
[2331.20 --> 2331.58]  Complex
[2331.58 --> 2332.34]  And we don't
[2332.34 --> 2332.92]  Know what to do
[2332.92 --> 2334.02]  And maybe we
[2334.02 --> 2334.52]  Don't have the
[2334.52 --> 2335.06]  Answers
[2335.06 --> 2336.54]  But what I want
[2336.54 --> 2337.14]  Us to see
[2337.14 --> 2337.94]  Is that God
[2337.94 --> 2339.56]  Does use
[2339.56 --> 2340.48]  Our actions
[2340.48 --> 2341.12]  In the world
[2341.12 --> 2342.14]  To bring
[2342.14 --> 2342.90]  His restoration
[2342.90 --> 2343.82]  Even in small
[2343.82 --> 2344.48]  Ways into
[2344.48 --> 2345.28]  People's lives
[2345.28 --> 2347.80]  So what's
[2347.80 --> 2348.66]  The very first
[2348.66 --> 2349.44]  Thing this guy
[2349.44 --> 2350.82]  That Peter says
[2350.82 --> 2351.40]  To this guy
[2351.40 --> 2351.96]  He says
[2351.96 --> 2352.88]  Look man
[2352.88 --> 2353.82]  I don't have
[2353.82 --> 2354.30]  Anything
[2354.30 --> 2354.90]  Right
[2354.90 --> 2355.44]  I'm poor
[2355.44 --> 2355.84]  Like you
[2355.84 --> 2356.68]  Silver and gold
[2356.68 --> 2357.94]  Have I not
[2357.94 --> 2359.50]  But I've got
[2359.50 --> 2359.86]  Jesus
[2359.86 --> 2361.40]  And I'm going
[2361.40 --> 2361.96]  To give him
[2361.96 --> 2362.42]  To you
[2362.42 --> 2362.76]  And he says
[2362.76 --> 2363.26]  In the name
[2363.26 --> 2363.90]  Of Jesus
[2363.90 --> 2364.92]  Rise up
[2364.92 --> 2365.40]  And walk
[2365.40 --> 2366.58]  You know
[2366.58 --> 2367.36]  Peter recognizes
[2367.36 --> 2368.42]  That if anything
[2368.42 --> 2369.42]  Good is going
[2369.42 --> 2370.00]  To come
[2370.00 --> 2371.12]  From his action
[2371.12 --> 2371.78]  In the world
[2371.78 --> 2372.54]  It's not going
[2372.54 --> 2372.80]  To come
[2372.80 --> 2373.44]  From himself
[2373.44 --> 2374.84]  But it's going
[2374.84 --> 2375.12]  To come
[2375.12 --> 2375.62]  From Jesus
[2375.62 --> 2377.26]  And this means
[2377.26 --> 2378.06]  That for us
[2378.06 --> 2378.92]  All of our
[2378.92 --> 2379.90]  Ministry
[2379.90 --> 2380.38]  Our mission
[2380.38 --> 2381.08]  In the world
[2381.08 --> 2382.82]  Whether individually
[2382.82 --> 2383.74]  As we go out
[2383.74 --> 2384.60]  Or as a church
[2384.60 --> 2385.52]  As we think
[2385.52 --> 2386.24]  Together about
[2386.24 --> 2386.66]  What it means
[2386.66 --> 2387.34]  For us as a
[2387.34 --> 2387.94]  Congregation
[2387.94 --> 2389.16]  To extend
[2389.16 --> 2390.00]  The healing hand
[2390.00 --> 2392.02]  It's always done
[2392.02 --> 2392.84]  Carried out
[2392.84 --> 2393.88]  By Jesus
[2393.88 --> 2394.94]  Working in us
[2394.94 --> 2395.82]  And through us
[2395.82 --> 2398.14]  And so friends
[2398.14 --> 2398.70]  That's the first
[2398.70 --> 2399.64]  Part of our mission
[2399.64 --> 2401.20]  We follow Jesus
[2401.20 --> 2401.90]  In the world
[2401.90 --> 2403.12]  We imitate him
[2403.12 --> 2404.18]  By extending
[2404.18 --> 2405.08]  The healing hand
[2405.08 --> 2406.14]  And that means
[2406.14 --> 2406.72]  We move out
[2406.72 --> 2407.52]  Into the world
[2407.52 --> 2408.36]  We recognize
[2408.36 --> 2409.12]  Its needs
[2409.12 --> 2410.54]  And we address
[2410.54 --> 2411.10]  Those needs
[2411.10 --> 2411.78]  In faith
[2411.78 --> 2412.92]  Relying on God
[2412.92 --> 2413.80]  To help us
[2413.80 --> 2415.92]  But there's
[2415.92 --> 2416.86]  A second part
[2416.86 --> 2417.86]  Of the mission
[2417.86 --> 2418.52]  Of the church
[2418.52 --> 2418.90]  That we need
[2418.90 --> 2419.40]  To talk about
[2419.40 --> 2419.78]  As well
[2419.78 --> 2421.04]  Because not only
[2421.04 --> 2421.66]  Does the church
[2421.66 --> 2423.00]  Extend the healing hand
[2423.00 --> 2424.00]  But what else
[2424.00 --> 2424.54]  Do we do
[2424.54 --> 2426.54]  We also proclaim
[2426.54 --> 2427.42]  The saving word
[2427.42 --> 2429.04]  And that's to say
[2429.04 --> 2429.68]  Not only do we
[2429.68 --> 2430.46]  Address the
[2430.46 --> 2431.54]  Material needs
[2431.54 --> 2432.12]  Of our neighbors
[2432.12 --> 2432.58]  As the church
[2432.58 --> 2433.56]  Has always done
[2433.56 --> 2434.90]  But also
[2434.90 --> 2436.52]  Its spiritual needs
[2436.52 --> 2437.82]  And that's what
[2437.82 --> 2438.36]  We see in the
[2438.36 --> 2438.94]  Second half
[2438.94 --> 2439.70]  Of this passage
[2439.70 --> 2440.64]  You know
[2440.64 --> 2441.18]  This passage
[2441.18 --> 2441.92]  Is clearly
[2441.92 --> 2442.74]  Divided into
[2442.74 --> 2443.40]  Two parts
[2443.40 --> 2444.32]  After Peter
[2444.32 --> 2444.86]  And John
[2444.86 --> 2445.86]  Performed the miracle
[2445.86 --> 2447.16]  Then Peter
[2447.16 --> 2447.84]  Gives a sermon
[2447.84 --> 2448.52]  Where he sort
[2448.52 --> 2449.82]  Of explains
[2449.82 --> 2451.30]  Very theologically
[2451.30 --> 2452.64]  What happened
[2452.64 --> 2454.52]  And there's
[2454.52 --> 2455.14]  A lot
[2455.14 --> 2456.02]  Going on here
[2456.02 --> 2456.58]  There's a lot
[2456.58 --> 2457.42]  We could talk
[2457.42 --> 2457.90]  About
[2457.90 --> 2460.14]  But let me
[2460.14 --> 2460.58]  Just note
[2460.58 --> 2461.58]  Two aspects
[2461.58 --> 2462.14]  Of what it
[2462.14 --> 2463.26]  Means to
[2463.26 --> 2464.04]  Proclaim the
[2464.04 --> 2464.64]  Saving word
[2464.64 --> 2464.98]  That's what
[2464.98 --> 2465.16]  We're going
[2465.16 --> 2465.62]  To focus on
[2465.62 --> 2465.90]  Today
[2465.90 --> 2467.90]  So first
[2467.90 --> 2468.58]  It means
[2468.58 --> 2469.74]  Proclaiming
[2469.74 --> 2470.10]  The saving
[2470.10 --> 2470.74]  Word means
[2470.74 --> 2472.30]  To expose
[2472.30 --> 2473.06]  The sins
[2473.06 --> 2473.62]  Of the world
[2473.62 --> 2474.64]  To expose
[2474.64 --> 2475.10]  The sins
[2475.10 --> 2475.60]  Of the world
[2475.60 --> 2477.04]  One of the
[2477.04 --> 2477.62]  Most kind
[2477.62 --> 2478.14]  Of striking
[2478.14 --> 2478.76]  Things about
[2478.76 --> 2479.46]  This passage
[2479.46 --> 2480.90]  Is that Peter
[2480.90 --> 2482.14]  Is this very
[2482.14 --> 2483.26]  Confrontational
[2483.26 --> 2483.86]  Guy in this
[2483.86 --> 2484.34]  Passage
[2484.34 --> 2485.18]  Like did you
[2485.18 --> 2485.74]  Notice that
[2485.74 --> 2487.34]  So let's
[2487.34 --> 2488.08]  Look at it
[2488.08 --> 2489.34]  So people
[2489.34 --> 2490.14]  See the
[2490.14 --> 2490.52]  Healing
[2490.52 --> 2492.04]  They all
[2492.04 --> 2493.06]  Run over
[2493.06 --> 2494.28]  They're astonished
[2494.28 --> 2494.96]  They're amazed
[2494.96 --> 2495.62]  And it says
[2495.62 --> 2496.12]  This in verse
[2496.12 --> 2496.46]  12
[2496.46 --> 2498.48]  When Peter
[2498.48 --> 2499.42]  Saw this
[2499.42 --> 2500.34]  All the people
[2500.34 --> 2501.00]  Running to him
[2501.00 --> 2501.82]  He said to them
[2501.82 --> 2503.06]  Fellow Israelites
[2503.06 --> 2503.86]  Why does this
[2503.86 --> 2504.42]  Surprise you
[2504.42 --> 2505.22]  Why do you
[2505.22 --> 2505.78]  Stare at us
[2505.78 --> 2506.46]  As if by our
[2506.46 --> 2507.04]  Own power
[2507.04 --> 2507.78]  Or godliness
[2507.78 --> 2508.72]  We made this
[2508.72 --> 2509.28]  Man walk
[2509.28 --> 2510.12]  The God of
[2510.12 --> 2510.44]  Abraham
[2510.44 --> 2511.00]  Isaac and
[2511.00 --> 2511.30]  Jacob
[2511.30 --> 2512.10]  The God of
[2512.10 --> 2512.74]  Our fathers
[2512.74 --> 2513.98]  Has glorified
[2513.98 --> 2514.48]  His servant
[2514.48 --> 2515.00]  Jesus
[2515.00 --> 2516.64]  You
[2516.64 --> 2517.78]  Handed him
[2517.78 --> 2518.28]  Over to be
[2518.28 --> 2518.68]  Killed
[2518.68 --> 2520.38]  You disowned
[2520.38 --> 2521.02]  Him before
[2521.02 --> 2521.54]  Pilate
[2521.54 --> 2522.22]  Though he
[2522.22 --> 2522.80]  Had decided
[2522.80 --> 2523.78]  To let him
[2523.78 --> 2524.04]  Go
[2524.04 --> 2525.42]  You
[2525.42 --> 2526.36]  Disowned
[2526.36 --> 2527.02]  The holy
[2527.02 --> 2527.52]  And righteous
[2527.52 --> 2527.90]  One
[2527.90 --> 2528.64]  And asked
[2528.64 --> 2529.00]  That a
[2529.00 --> 2529.78]  Murderer
[2529.78 --> 2530.54]  Be released
[2530.54 --> 2530.98]  To you
[2530.98 --> 2531.86]  You killed
[2531.86 --> 2532.36]  The author
[2532.36 --> 2533.12]  Of life
[2533.12 --> 2534.16]  But god
[2534.16 --> 2534.82]  Raised him
[2534.82 --> 2535.40]  From the dead
[2535.40 --> 2535.88]  Of this
[2535.88 --> 2536.70]  We are witnesses
[2536.70 --> 2538.08]  Right
[2538.08 --> 2538.78]  Peter
[2538.78 --> 2540.38]  Is saying
[2540.38 --> 2541.40]  You all
[2541.40 --> 2541.92]  Made some
[2541.92 --> 2542.34]  Very
[2542.34 --> 2543.40]  Bad
[2543.40 --> 2544.44]  Moral
[2544.44 --> 2544.84]  Decisions
[2544.84 --> 2545.10]  Here
[2545.10 --> 2546.60]  And
[2546.60 --> 2546.86]  Peter
[2546.86 --> 2547.42]  Is not
[2547.42 --> 2548.20]  Actually
[2548.20 --> 2549.28]  Or exactly
[2549.28 --> 2549.94]  Out to
[2549.94 --> 2550.50]  Make friends
[2550.50 --> 2551.82]  He doesn't
[2551.82 --> 2552.36]  Let them
[2552.36 --> 2552.96]  Dwell
[2552.96 --> 2553.42]  On this
[2553.42 --> 2553.82]  Miracle
[2553.82 --> 2554.16]  And how
[2554.16 --> 2554.56]  Amazing
[2554.56 --> 2555.16]  It is
[2555.16 --> 2556.08]  But what
[2556.08 --> 2556.36]  Does he
[2556.36 --> 2556.76]  Do
[2556.76 --> 2558.46]  Just as
[2558.46 --> 2559.10]  He looked
[2559.10 --> 2559.38]  At the
[2559.38 --> 2559.76]  Beggar
[2559.76 --> 2560.34]  And saw
[2560.34 --> 2561.30]  The beggar's
[2561.30 --> 2561.92]  Needs
[2561.92 --> 2564.34]  So he
[2564.34 --> 2564.78]  Looks
[2564.78 --> 2565.22]  At the
[2565.22 --> 2566.00]  Crowds
[2566.00 --> 2566.72]  And he
[2566.72 --> 2567.02]  Sees
[2567.02 --> 2567.46]  Their
[2567.46 --> 2567.86]  Need
[2567.86 --> 2568.68]  And what
[2568.68 --> 2568.86]  Is
[2568.86 --> 2569.06]  Their
[2569.06 --> 2569.50]  Need
[2569.50 --> 2570.30]  Their
[2570.30 --> 2570.62]  Need
[2570.62 --> 2570.90]  Is to
[2570.90 --> 2571.04]  Be
[2571.04 --> 2571.52]  Saved
[2571.52 --> 2571.80]  From
[2571.80 --> 2572.02]  Their
[2572.02 --> 2572.44]  Sins
[2572.44 --> 2573.60]  Because
[2573.60 --> 2573.96]  Remember
[2573.96 --> 2574.34]  Just a
[2574.34 --> 2574.50]  Few
[2574.50 --> 2574.82]  Weeks
[2574.82 --> 2575.18]  Ago
[2575.18 --> 2576.26]  A few
[2576.26 --> 2576.50]  Weeks
[2576.50 --> 2576.88]  Earlier
[2576.88 --> 2578.30]  Jesus
[2578.30 --> 2579.12]  Was murdered
[2579.12 --> 2579.78]  In that
[2579.78 --> 2580.08]  Very
[2580.08 --> 2580.44]  City
[2580.44 --> 2580.94]  In
[2580.94 --> 2581.40]  Jerusalem
[2581.40 --> 2582.18]  Handed
[2582.18 --> 2582.60]  Over to
[2582.60 --> 2582.74]  The
[2582.74 --> 2582.94]  Roman
[2582.94 --> 2583.34]  Government
[2583.34 --> 2583.80]  By a
[2583.80 --> 2584.18]  Violent
[2584.18 --> 2584.56]  Crowd
[2584.56 --> 2585.62]  And in
[2585.62 --> 2585.84]  That
[2585.84 --> 2586.28]  Moment
[2586.28 --> 2587.74]  That
[2587.74 --> 2588.18]  Crowd
[2588.18 --> 2588.98]  Showed
[2588.98 --> 2589.56]  That
[2589.56 --> 2590.04]  They
[2590.04 --> 2590.54]  Were
[2590.54 --> 2591.22]  Enemies

[2611.34 --> 2611.72]  Peter's

[2612.76 --> 2613.12]  Today
[2613.12 --> 2613.30]  He's
[2613.30 --> 2613.40]  Not
[2613.40 --> 2613.54]  Having
[2613.54 --> 2613.68]  A
[2613.68 --> 2613.88]  Bad
[2613.88 --> 2614.16]  Day
[2614.16 --> 2614.72]  He's
[2614.72 --> 2615.00]  Living
[2615.00 --> 2615.24]  Out

[2615.82 --> 2615.96]  The
[2615.96 --> 2616.32]  Church
[2616.32 --> 2616.94]  He's
[2616.94 --> 2617.24]  Paving
[2617.24 --> 2617.46]  The
[2617.46 --> 2617.72]  Way
[2617.72 --> 2618.64]  For
[2618.64 --> 2619.28]  Salvation
[2619.28 --> 2620.02]  By

[2620.68 --> 2620.94]  Their
[2620.94 --> 2621.58]  Need
[2621.58 --> 2622.12]  For
[2622.12 --> 2622.44]  It
[2622.44 --> 2623.58]  And
[2623.58 --> 2623.90]  That's
[2623.90 --> 2624.06]  What
[2624.06 --> 2624.30]  We
[2624.30 --> 2624.62]  Do
[2624.62 --> 2624.94]  As
[2624.94 --> 2625.24]  Well
[2625.24 --> 2626.50]  So
[2626.50 --> 2626.74]  That's
[2626.74 --> 2626.86]  The
[2626.86 --> 2627.12]  First
[2627.12 --> 2627.50]  Thing
[2627.50 --> 2628.02]  But
[2628.02 --> 2628.18]  The
[2628.18 --> 2628.46]  Second
[2628.46 --> 2628.72]  Thing
[2628.72 --> 2628.88]  Is
[2628.88 --> 2629.20]  This
[2629.20 --> 2630.42]  That's
[2630.42 --> 2630.54]  Not
[2630.54 --> 2630.66]  The
[2630.66 --> 2630.82]  Only
[2630.82 --> 2631.02]  Thing
[2631.02 --> 2631.18]  That
[2631.18 --> 2631.32]  We
[2631.32 --> 2631.56]  Do
[2631.56 --> 2632.62]  There's
[2632.62 --> 2632.74]  A
[2632.74 --> 2632.96]  Second
[2632.96 --> 2633.40]  Step

[2633.72 --> 2634.32]  Proclaiming
[2634.32 --> 2634.48]  The
[2634.48 --> 2634.74]  Saving
[2634.74 --> 2635.16]  Word
[2635.16 --> 2636.18]  And
[2636.18 --> 2636.30]  It's
[2636.30 --> 2636.48]  Not
[2636.48 --> 2636.76]  Just
[2636.76 --> 2637.28]  Exposing
[2637.28 --> 2637.84]  People's
[2637.84 --> 2638.10]  Sin

[2639.44 --> 2639.62]  Of
[2639.62 --> 2639.92]  Jesus

[2642.92 --> 2643.12]  World
[2643.12 --> 2643.28]  Is
[2643.28 --> 2643.42]  Not

[2646.02 --> 2646.84]  Confrontation
[2646.84 --> 2647.74]  Rather
[2647.74 --> 2648.06]  It's
[2648.06 --> 2649.04]  Fundamentally
[2649.04 --> 2649.56]  A
[2649.56 --> 2649.80]  Word

[2682.82 --> 2683.24]  Lame
[2683.24 --> 2683.58]  Man

[2685.48 --> 2685.74]  Help
[2685.74 --> 2686.10]  Yourself

[2689.74 --> 2690.30]  Cut

[2690.86 --> 2691.18]  God's
[2691.18 --> 2691.66]  Presence
[2691.66 --> 2692.34]  But
[2692.34 --> 2692.54]  There
[2692.54 --> 2692.68]  Is
[2692.68 --> 2692.98]  Hope
[2692.98 --> 2693.30]  For
[2693.30 --> 2693.56]  You

[2693.98 --> 2694.12]  Is
[2694.12 --> 2694.56]  Salvation
[2694.56 --> 2694.92]  Because
[2694.92 --> 2695.26]  Jesus
[2695.26 --> 2695.70]  Came
[2695.70 --> 2696.08]  And
[2696.08 --> 2696.20]  He
[2696.20 --> 2696.48]  Died
[2696.48 --> 2696.62]  And
[2696.62 --> 2696.74]  He
[2696.74 --> 2696.96]  Took
[2696.96 --> 2697.22]  Away
[2697.22 --> 2697.44]  Your
[2697.44 --> 2697.84]  Sins
[2703.28 --> 2712.12]  And
[2712.12 --> 2713.22]  I
[2713.22 --> 2713.44]  Think
[2713.44 --> 2713.60]  The
[2713.60 --> 2713.96]  Beautiful
[2713.96 --> 2714.62]  Thing
[2714.62 --> 2715.12]  About
[2715.12 --> 2715.56]  This
[2715.56 --> 2716.38]  Is
[2716.38 --> 2716.54]  That
[2716.54 --> 2716.66]  It
[2716.66 --> 2716.82]  Is
[2716.82 --> 2717.20]  Peter
[2717.20 --> 2717.38]  Who
[2717.38 --> 2717.54]  Is
[2717.54 --> 2717.74]  Saying
[2717.74 --> 2718.10]  This
[2718.10 --> 2719.10]  Right
[2719.10 --> 2719.32]  This
[2719.32 --> 2719.44]  Is
[2719.44 --> 2719.56]  The
[2719.56 --> 2719.80]  Same
[2719.80 --> 2720.26]  Peter
[2720.26 --> 2720.86]  Who
[2720.86 --> 2721.12]  Had
[2721.12 --> 2721.60]  Denied
[2721.60 --> 2721.96]  Jesus
[2721.96 --> 2723.06]  The
[2723.06 --> 2723.28]  Same
[2723.28 --> 2723.62]  Peter
[2723.62 --> 2723.90]  Who
[2723.90 --> 2724.54]  Himself
[2724.54 --> 2725.08]  Was
[2725.08 --> 2725.70]  Confronted
[2725.70 --> 2725.92]  By
[2725.92 --> 2726.28]  Jesus
[2726.28 --> 2726.52]  In
[2726.52 --> 2726.76]  His
[2726.76 --> 2727.08]  Sin
[2727.08 --> 2728.40]  But
[2728.40 --> 2728.68]  Also
[2728.68 --> 2728.92]  Was
[2728.92 --> 2729.66]  Consoled
[2729.66 --> 2729.92]  By
[2729.92 --> 2730.36]  Jesus
[2730.36 --> 2730.80]  In
[2730.80 --> 2731.22]  His
[2731.22 --> 2731.76]  Grace
[2731.76 --> 2732.00]  And
[2732.00 --> 2732.38]  Love
[2732.38 --> 2741.76]  Peter himself was not condemned only by sin but he had received grace and he now turns
[2741.76 --> 2754.42]  and he doesn't only offer this exposing their sins but he just like him extends grace because
[2754.42 --> 2760.00]  he has received it and this too is the mission of the church right having exposed the sins of the
[2760.00 --> 2765.48]  world just as our sins have been exposed we now offer the grace of Jesus to the world
[2765.48 --> 2774.24]  and friends the greatest need anyone will ever have is to receive the grace of Jesus Christ
[2774.24 --> 2783.92]  right that is our true need there are many needs in this world there are physical needs there are
[2783.92 --> 2789.86]  social needs there are relational needs there are economic needs but our need for grace is the need
[2789.86 --> 2799.20]  that is beneath all of these other needs but before you know Peter and John met that lame man what was
[2799.20 --> 2804.94]  that man thinking I think we know what he was thinking because we think the same way I imagine
[2804.94 --> 2812.40]  he was thinking if I could walk if only I could walk my problems would be over everything would be okay
[2812.40 --> 2820.38]  to which Peter wants to say to him really right look around brother there are plenty of people
[2820.38 --> 2826.86]  who are walking are they are all their problems solved are they happy
[2826.86 --> 2835.78]  you and I know that every one of us is looking for silver and gold right we're looking for physical
[2835.78 --> 2843.42]  healing we're looking for our circumstances to change and we think these surface level adjustments
[2843.42 --> 2851.96]  will bring deeper change to us they will heal what is most broken down deep down we usually know that
[2851.96 --> 2860.84]  they won't but we still kind of hold out hope that they will and I mean is money more money helpful of
[2860.84 --> 2868.82]  course it is right is feels the physical healing good of course but God didn't come to earth and die
[2868.82 --> 2875.88]  on the cross and rise again just so that he could heal our physical infirmities rather he came to heal our
[2875.88 --> 2882.36]  deepest need which is to bring us back into relationship with God so what you and I need more than anything
[2882.36 --> 2889.58]  else is a heart that has been transformed by this grace and that has been filled by knowledge of God's
[2889.58 --> 2900.32]  love for us I think it was C.S. Lewis who said you know people who have God and everything else have
[2900.32 --> 2908.18]  nothing more than people who only have God because that is all that we truly need now Jesus comes and he
[2908.18 --> 2914.18]  is going to restore and heal everything broken by sin including the social and the economic and the physical
[2914.18 --> 2922.00]  but he does so by restoring us to God and then sending us out to imitate him and bring his healing to the world
[2922.00 --> 2930.08]  and so let me pray for us that God would help us to to imitate Jesus with our shoes and our hands
[2930.08 --> 2936.96]  to beg that he would allow us to follow him to be with him wherever he goes in this world by his spirit
[2936.96 --> 2938.96]  so let me pray for us
[2938.96 --> 2947.04]  our heavenly father we thank you for your grace that is astounding and amazing
[2947.04 --> 2950.48]  the grace that has come to us in our sin
[2950.48 --> 2955.98]  though we didn't deserve it and like that lame man spiritually we were beggars
[2955.98 --> 2960.22]  but lord as we have received grace we are but beggars who have
[2960.22 --> 2967.56]  found the source of food and so we we share it with others not because we have anything but because
[2967.56 --> 2974.24]  we know where it comes from it comes from Jesus and it comes freely by his grace so we thank you lord
[2974.24 --> 2980.22]  we ask that you would help us to follow you to extend the healing hand to proclaim the saving word
[2980.22 --> 2983.02]  we pray in Jesus name amen
[2983.02 --> 2990.02]  so let's sing our song of response together
[2990.02 --> 2992.02]  we pray in Jesus
[2992.02 --> 2997.02]  of Jesus our king
[2997.02 --> 3003.02]  we pray in Jesus our king
[3003.02 --> 3007.02]  we pray in Jesus our king
[3007.02 --> 3011.02]  we pray in Jesus our king
[3011.02 --> 3012.70]  we pray in Jesus our king
[3012.70 --> 3013.02]  we have known the beginning of our holy kardeş
[3013.02 --> 3017.02]  we be looking in Jesus our king
[3017.02 --> 3039.02]  we live in Jesus O he's funcion Ahh
[3039.02 --> 3047.06]  And tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[3049.48 --> 3057.18]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[3057.60 --> 3064.06]  His power in us is greater than, is greater than this world.
[3064.06 --> 3072.30]  To share the reason for hope, to serve with love and grace.
[3072.76 --> 3079.94]  Let all who see Him shine through us, might bring the Father praise.
[3080.40 --> 3092.10]  O save my soul, and tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[3094.06 --> 3102.30]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[3102.66 --> 3109.56]  No other name on earth can save and raise us so to life.
[3110.02 --> 3116.30]  He opens up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown.
[3116.30 --> 3124.74]  We labor in His fields of grace, as He leads sinners home.
[3124.74 --> 3136.88]  O save my soul, and tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[3136.88 --> 3150.24]  So we continue to worship the Lord by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3150.80 --> 3154.24]  And the Bible reminds us that all we have is given to us by God.
[3154.24 --> 3158.50]  And our offerings express our joyful dependence on Him,
[3158.80 --> 3163.46]  as well as our commitment to join Him in His work of renewal.
[3163.46 --> 3169.10]  And so according to my notes, our designated offering this Sunday is the Deacon Help Fund.
[3170.12 --> 3175.92]  And the Deacon Help Fund is used to provide assistance to those in financial need within our own church family.
[3176.64 --> 3183.12]  And so if you do have a need, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me or the deacons.
[3183.12 --> 3193.58]  And so would you please join me in a prayer, a community prayer for the world, for the church, and for the mission.
[3193.88 --> 3194.60]  Let's pray together.
[3197.72 --> 3203.26]  O Lord Jesus, we thank you for the eternal things that are unseen.
[3203.26 --> 3213.36]  God, we ask that you would train us to remember that our afflictions are momentary in light.
[3214.26 --> 3220.04]  Our problems and the problems of this world may feel eternal and intractable,
[3220.60 --> 3223.56]  but yet they are actually fleeting and transient.
[3223.56 --> 3228.46]  Gracious Father, we pray especially for Christians around the world,
[3228.96 --> 3233.62]  that you would remind them and us that we are already your children.
[3234.48 --> 3243.32]  Help all of us as your children to remember and to revel in how wide and long and high and deep is your love,
[3243.88 --> 3246.36]  and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[3247.14 --> 3250.68]  that we may be filled to all of your fullness.
[3250.68 --> 3256.34]  And Lord, we lift up to you this morning our brothers and sisters in this congregation.
[3257.16 --> 3261.88]  We pray especially for Sandy as she mourns the passing of her husband, Bill.
[3262.52 --> 3270.70]  And we pray also for the family, for the brothers and sisters, the children who are also mourned.
[3271.26 --> 3274.16]  And we thank you, Lord, that Bill is now with you in glory.
[3274.44 --> 3277.66]  And what a wonderful and comforting truth that we can hold on to,
[3277.66 --> 3281.06]  even as we grieve his absence from us now.
[3282.56 --> 3286.86]  And Lord, we ask for your mercy upon Tim and Joan and Kathy.
[3287.58 --> 3290.60]  Lord, give them the strength to live for you each day,
[3291.24 --> 3293.28]  even in the face of present suffering,
[3294.10 --> 3295.26]  knowing that your love,
[3296.20 --> 3297.02]  knowing your love,
[3297.28 --> 3299.72]  and that your face is upon them.
[3299.72 --> 3302.42]  And Lord, we lift up to you, Andre,
[3303.08 --> 3305.30]  after the horrible accident in Alberta.
[3306.18 --> 3311.60]  Lord, we thank you that he has now been transported to Vancouver General Hospital,
[3311.86 --> 3312.54]  close to home.
[3313.36 --> 3315.62]  But Lord, he needs your healing hand upon him.
[3316.42 --> 3322.10]  Lord, we thank you that his head is okay.
[3322.30 --> 3324.94]  There doesn't seem to be any brain injury.
[3324.94 --> 3327.30]  But Lord, his body still needs healing.
[3327.62 --> 3332.04]  Lord, we pray that you would grant him full recovery of all of his movement.
[3333.24 --> 3335.82]  We pray also that you would be with Rick and Yvonne
[3335.82 --> 3338.14]  and comfort them in the midst of this trial.
[3339.54 --> 3345.02]  Lord, we thank you that there will come a day when every tear will be wiped away,
[3345.64 --> 3347.54]  when you will renew all things,
[3348.08 --> 3353.58]  when your church will be as a bride beautifully dressed for our husband,
[3353.58 --> 3359.26]  and that your dwelling will be among us in undeniable ways.
[3360.68 --> 3364.30]  There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[3364.76 --> 3367.78]  for the old order of things will have passed away.
[3368.64 --> 3374.30]  So Lord Jesus, let these eternal truths shape our daily lives today.
[3375.18 --> 3377.68]  Holy Spirit, you are the down payment,
[3377.88 --> 3379.78]  guaranteeing what is to come.
[3379.78 --> 3383.86]  So help us to live by your spirit in your power.
[3384.36 --> 3386.08]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3387.02 --> 3387.32]  Amen.
[3388.92 --> 3392.60]  So now, brothers and sisters, let us go out and serve the world
[3392.60 --> 3395.32]  as those who love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[3395.62 --> 3397.08]  We go with his blessing upon us,
[3397.12 --> 3401.94]  so I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the benediction.
[3401.94 --> 3406.44]  Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[3407.26 --> 3411.84]  to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy,
[3412.40 --> 3414.20]  to the only God our Savior,
[3414.82 --> 3416.06]  through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[3416.16 --> 3418.94]  be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[3418.94 --> 3421.02]  before all time and now and forever.
[3421.84 --> 3422.12]  Amen.
[3423.26 --> 3426.56]  And let's sing our final song to close as we go.
[3426.56 --> 3451.88]  Praise the Lord,
[3451.88 --> 3455.88]  from whom all blessings flow.
[3455.88 --> 3465.88]  He has washed and made me white as snow.
[3465.88 --> 3475.88]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[3475.88 --> 3479.88]  Now and forever.

[3532.88 --> 3536.88]  Now and forever.
