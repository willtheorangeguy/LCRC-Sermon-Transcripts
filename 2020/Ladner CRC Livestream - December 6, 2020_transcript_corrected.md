[298.78 → 300.06] Well, good morning.
[301.74 → 306.04] And welcome to our livestream worship service here at Latin New York Christian Reformed Church.
[306.34 → 310.08] Even though we can't be together physically, we can still be gathered virtually.
[310.30 → 314.70] and we can be assured that God is among us and will bless this time of worship.
[316.22 → 321.20] Today's offerings will go towards our denominational commitments or shares, as it's otherwise known.
[321.20 → 330.88] That includes supporting various ministries of the Christian Reformed Church, including, among others, Coffee Break, Friendship Coffee House, Resonate Global Mission, and many more.
[332.28 → 339.56] Lots of ways to make donations. You can drop them off or mail them into the church, or you can go online and give online,
[339.56 → 342.74] or even via pre-authorized payment, if you want to set that up with Mel.
[346.40 → 351.50] God greets us this morning and calls us to worship him with these words, based on Romans 13.
[353.02 → 357.66] You know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep.
[358.80 → 362.18] For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers.
[363.06 → 366.24] The night is far gone, the day is near.
[366.24 → 371.26] Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.
[371.74 → 373.78] Come, let us worship God.
[375.12 → 379.32] Now our praise team is going to lead us in three songs and the lighting of the Advent candle.
[379.32 → 386.70] All right.
[389.56 → 395.80] The light of the world you step down into me,
[395.80 → 399.90] let him go.
[399.90 → 410.76] Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[410.76 → 416.08] Open my eyes, let me see.
[416.52 → 422.66] Beauty that made this heart adore you.
[423.14 → 427.54] Hope of a life spent with you.
[429.90 → 432.88] So here I am to worship.
[433.54 → 436.16] Here I am to bow down.
[436.16 → 441.60] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[441.96 → 453.62] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[453.62 → 469.88] King of all days, oh so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above.
[469.88 → 499.88] 
[499.88 → 507.88] Altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[507.88 → 524.34] And I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross.
[524.34 → 537.26] I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross.
[537.26 → 541.64] So here I am to worship.
[541.64 → 545.02] Here I am to bow down.
[545.02 → 550.56] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[550.56 → 562.52] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[562.52 → 592.50] Here I am to worship.
[592.50 → 593.64] Here I am to worship.
[593.70 → 594.30] Dallas.
[594.36 → 595.64] Here I am to worship.
[595.64 → 596.38] There I am to summon that cross.
[596.42 → 598.32] Here there you are.
[598.32 → 599.02] Here I am to worship.
[599.06 → 600.12] Whatever it is.
[600.14 → 603.08] Here I may worship.
[603.08 → 604.08] Here I am to worship.
[604.10 → 605.20] Thank you.
[605.26 → 607.86] My God all linked brothers in heaven above.
[607.92 → 608.74] And amen to worship.
[608.84 → 609.60] This morning, Thomas Bishop Michael Universal Ko sends an attention toично available.
[609.66 → 611.34] Hear this condemned.
[611.70 → 613.48] Jim Walker, ells in heaven above the.
[613.56 → 614.50] Beautiful dwelling beyond the world whose honour in heaven above there is sunlight.
[614.66 → 618.04] Laura thanks to worship the space of Jesus saint there as well.
[618.22 → 619.50] answer the wall meaning to your Soviet before me.
[619.50 → 627.94] Whatever is His way, all is well.
[630.86 → 640.54] All my changes come from Him, He who never changes.
[640.54 → 651.54] I'm held firm in the grasp of the rock of all the ages.
[652.66 → 661.54] All is well with my soul.
[661.54 → 671.40] He is God in control.
[674.08 → 684.38] I know not all His plans.
[684.38 → 694.00] But I know I'm in His hands.
[694.00 → 707.84] He closes now, then strips us.
[708.56 → 713.00] And with His word equips us.
[714.46 → 720.00] Whatever is His way, all is well.
[720.00 → 735.00] Though our seasons change, we still exalt His name.
[736.58 → 743.00] Whatever is His way, all is well.
[743.00 → 756.56] All my changes come from Him, He who never changes.
[756.56 → 767.56] I'm held firm in the grasp of the rock of all the ages.
[767.56 → 777.56] All is well with my soul.
[777.56 → 786.56] He is God in control.
[786.56 → 788.56] He is God in control.
[788.56 → 799.74] I know not all His plans.
[799.74 → 809.24] But I know I'm in His hands.
[809.24 → 821.24] He is God in control.
[821.24 → 825.38] Last Sunday we lit the candle of hope.
[825.38 → 831.32] And we are reminded to put our hope in God's promise of a peaceful kingdom.
[831.32 → 839.32] Let's pray.
[839.32 → 840.32] Amen.
[840.32 → 845.84] On this second Sunday of Advent, we light the candle of love.
[845.84 → 854.68] Our God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[854.68 → 861.68] We light this candle to remember God's love, which brings joy to the world and peace on earth.
[861.68 → 863.68] Then I'm going to put it on.
[863.68 → 864.68] That's not good.
[864.68 → 872.68] Thank you very much.
[872.68 → 877.68] Thank you.
[877.68 → 901.30] Come behold the wondrous mystery
[901.30 → 905.90] In the dawning of the King
[905.90 → 910.76] He the theme of heaven's praises
[910.76 → 914.46] Robed in frail humanity
[914.46 → 919.90] In our longing, in our darkness
[919.90 → 924.64] Now the light of life has come
[924.64 → 929.16] Look to Christ who condescended
[929.16 → 933.96] To God's flesh to ransom us
[935.90 → 945.06] Come behold the wondrous mystery
[945.06 → 948.76] Be the perfect Son of man
[948.76 → 953.84] In His living, in His suffering
[953.84 → 958.08] Never trace nor stain of sin
[958.08 → 962.78] See the true and bitter Adam
[962.78 → 967.40] Come to save the humble man
[967.40 → 971.08] Christ the great and sure fulfillment
[971.08 → 976.86] Of the law in Him, we stand
[976.86 → 987.82] Come behold the wondrous mystery
[987.82 → 992.08] Christ the Lord upon the tree
[992.08 → 997.44] In the stead of ruined sinners
[997.44 → 1001.24] Hangs our Lamb in victory
[1001.24 → 1006.64] See the price of our redemption
[1006.64 → 1011.08] See the Father's plan unfold
[1011.08 → 1016.08] Bringing many souls to glory
[1016.08 → 1021.08] Grace unmeasured, love untold
[1021.08 → 1031.08] Come behold the wondrous mystery
[1031.08 → 1035.94] Slain by death, the God of life
[1035.94 → 1040.40] But no grave could e'er restrain Him
[1040.40 → 1044.50] Praise the Lord, He is alive
[1044.50 → 1048.08] What a far taste of deliverance
[1048.08 → 1053.34] How unwavering our hope
[1053.34 → 1057.50] Christ in power resurrected
[1057.50 → 1062.18] As we will be when He comes
[1062.18 → 1066.70] What a far taste of deliverance
[1066.70 → 1072.34] How unwavering our hope
[1072.34 → 1077.58] Christ in power resurrected
[1077.58 → 1084.22] As we will be when He comes
[1084.22 → 1101.74] Please join me in a prayer of confession
[1101.74 → 1107.12] Lord, we have not kept watch for you
[1107.12 → 1109.18] We have occupied ourselves
[1109.18 → 1110.38] With our own concerns
[1110.38 → 1113.82] We have not waited to find your will for us
[1113.82 → 1116.24] We have not noticed the needs
[1116.24 → 1117.44] Of the people around us
[1117.44 → 1119.92] We have not acknowledged the love
[1119.92 → 1121.74] That has been shown to us
[1121.74 → 1124.86] Forgive us for our lack of watchfulness
[1124.86 → 1127.96] Help us to wait to know your will
[1127.96 → 1131.18] Help us to look out for the needs of others
[1131.18 → 1134.98] Help us to work and watch for your coming
[1134.98 → 1135.80] Amen
[1135.80 → 1139.48] And our confidence as Christians
[1139.48 → 1142.92] Is that in Christ we have forgiveness of sins
[1142.92 → 1145.08] We are reminded of that this morning
[1145.08 → 1147.46] With these words based on Jeremiah 33
[1147.46 → 1150.30] The days are surely coming
[1150.30 → 1153.68] When I will fulfill the promise I made
[1153.68 → 1154.80] To the house of Israel
[1154.80 → 1156.06] And the house of Judah
[1156.06 → 1158.28] In those days
[1158.28 → 1159.78] And at that time
[1159.78 → 1161.68] I will cause a righteous branch
[1161.68 → 1163.54] To spring up for David
[1163.54 → 1166.42] And he shall execute justice
[1166.42 → 1167.80] And righteousness in the land
[1167.80 → 1169.42] In those days
[1169.42 → 1170.88] Judah will be saved
[1170.88 → 1172.94] And Jerusalem will live in safety
[1172.94 → 1175.96] And this is the name by which it will be called
[1175.96 → 1178.00] The Lord is our righteousness
[1178.00 → 1179.86] People of God
[1179.86 → 1182.36] Jesus Christ our Lord
[1182.36 → 1184.64] Whose coming we announce in this season
[1184.64 → 1186.26] Is our righteousness
[1186.26 → 1189.78] In Christ we are made right with God
[1189.78 → 1191.72] Thanks be to God
[1191.72 → 1193.88] Let's celebrate our Lord
[1193.88 → 1194.96] By singing once again
[1194.96 → 1213.92] Jesus Christ
[1213.92 → 1217.64] I think upon your sacrifice
[1217.64 → 1220.32] You became nothing
[1220.32 → 1220.88] You became nothing
[1220.88 → 1223.96] Poured out to death
[1223.96 → 1226.92] Many times
[1226.92 → 1230.74] I've wondered at your gift of life
[1230.74 → 1234.64] And I'm in that place once again
[1234.64 → 1235.64] Once again
[1235.64 → 1241.64] I'm in that place once again
[1241.64 → 1249.84] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1249.84 → 1252.98] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1252.98 → 1255.50] And I'm broken inside
[1255.50 → 1259.72] Once again I thank you
[1259.72 → 1264.72] Once again I pour out my life
[1264.72 → 1276.58] Now you are exalted to the highest place
[1276.58 → 1279.36] King of the heavens
[1279.36 → 1282.54] Where one day I'll bow
[1282.54 → 1289.40] But for now I marvel at this saving grace
[1289.40 → 1293.40] I'm full of praise once again
[1293.40 → 1299.40] I'm full of praise once again
[1299.40 → 1307.40] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1307.40 → 1311.20] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1311.20 → 1314.46] And I'm broken inside
[1314.46 → 1318.08] Once again I thank you
[1318.08 → 1323.08] Once again I pour out my life
[1323.08 → 1336.66] Well good morning brothers and sisters
[1336.66 → 1339.54] It's so great knowing that
[1339.54 → 1342.32] even though again as Jake has said
[1342.32 → 1343.20] we're not here physically
[1343.20 → 1345.84] But that we are one body of Christ
[1345.84 → 1348.48] And that God has really knit us together
[1348.48 → 1349.92] In the Holy Spirit
[1349.92 → 1351.64] So that we can worship together
[1351.64 → 1355.26] And so this is the second Sunday of Advent
[1355.26 → 1359.08] And in Advent we remember
[1359.08 → 1361.86] how our four barriers
[1361.86 → 1363.30] the people of God Israel
[1363.30 → 1365.70] waited for many long centuries
[1365.70 → 1368.08] for the promised Messiah to come
[1368.08 → 1370.08] And in the fullness of time
[1370.08 → 1371.32] God kept his promise
[1371.32 → 1373.66] and sent the Messiah Jesus
[1373.66 → 1374.66] into the world
[1374.66 → 1378.14] But also Advent looks forward to
[1378.14 → 1379.48] another coming
[1379.48 → 1380.44] and that is
[1380.44 → 1382.18] that the church now
[1382.18 → 1382.82] us
[1382.82 → 1384.32] the people of God
[1384.32 → 1385.18] we wait
[1385.18 → 1386.48] for Jesus
[1386.48 → 1387.70] to return
[1387.70 → 1389.86] We wait for the return of the king
[1389.86 → 1391.08] to come
[1391.08 → 1393.00] and to renew all things
[1393.00 → 1395.62] And so this Advent season
[1395.62 → 1397.42] we're looking at the Gospel of Luke
[1397.42 → 1399.58] and we're considering together
[1399.58 → 1400.88] how Jesus Christ
[1400.88 → 1402.64] is the king of our longings
[1402.64 → 1405.34] and how when he comes
[1405.34 → 1407.36] and when he comes again
[1407.36 → 1408.30] in all of its fullness
[1408.30 → 1410.42] that he will fulfill
[1410.42 → 1412.52] our desires as men
[1412.52 → 1413.60] and women and children
[1413.60 → 1416.22] for all the things
[1416.22 → 1416.96] that we long for
[1416.96 → 1419.36] And so today we're going to be looking
[1419.36 → 1420.88] at Luke chapter 1
[1420.88 → 1422.68] verses 26 to 38
[1422.68 → 1424.68] and this is a passage
[1424.68 → 1425.76] known as
[1425.76 → 1427.10] the Annunciation
[1427.10 → 1429.56] So it's this well-known story
[1429.56 → 1430.90] where the angel Gabriel
[1430.90 → 1432.22] comes to Mary
[1432.22 → 1433.90] and announces
[1433.90 → 1435.90] that she will bear
[1435.90 → 1437.56] God's son
[1437.56 → 1439.92] And so to help us
[1439.92 → 1441.36] enter into the story
[1441.36 → 1442.94] with our imaginations
[1442.94 → 1445.08] I want to share this
[1445.08 → 1446.62] picture with you
[1446.62 → 1450.22] It's not working
[1450.22 → 1457.48] There it is
[1457.48 → 1457.94] Okay
[1457.94 → 1460.82] So this is
[1460.82 → 1462.16] a painting
[1462.16 → 1463.30] by the artist
[1463.30 → 1463.82] Henry
[1463.82 → 1465.00] Asama
[1465.00 → 1465.52] Tanner
[1465.52 → 1467.82] He is the first
[1467.82 → 1470.04] African-American artist
[1470.04 → 1471.02] to gain
[1471.02 → 1472.28] worldwide
[1472.28 → 1473.40] acclaim
[1473.40 → 1474.66] And
[1474.66 → 1477.48] I think it's a beautiful picture
[1477.48 → 1478.68] Notice the light
[1478.68 → 1480.68] It's how bright it is
[1480.68 → 1481.34] Just with
[1481.34 → 1482.62] that white there
[1482.62 → 1484.66] And then Mary's expression
[1484.66 → 1485.60] in the
[1485.60 → 1487.06] bedclothes
[1487.06 → 1489.72] But it's a beautiful picture
[1489.72 → 1490.72] And so this is kind of
[1490.72 → 1491.36] the scene
[1491.36 → 1493.34] that we are entering into
[1493.34 → 1494.24] as we read
[1494.24 → 1495.52] the passage
[1495.52 → 1496.54] this morning
[1496.54 → 1497.80] And so let me
[1497.80 → 1498.80] read it for us
[1498.80 → 1502.20] And we
[1502.20 → 1503.32] will read it
[1503.32 → 1504.22] So Luke 1
[1504.22 → 1505.30] 26 to 38
[1505.30 → 1507.54] Please give your attention
[1507.54 → 1508.68] to the reading of God's word
[1508.68 → 1510.30] In the sixth month
[1510.30 → 1511.58] of Elizabeth's pregnancy
[1511.58 → 1513.30] God sent the angel
[1513.30 → 1513.78] Gabriel
[1513.78 → 1514.66] to Nazareth
[1514.66 → 1516.36] a town in Galilee
[1516.36 → 1517.70] to a virgin
[1517.70 → 1518.94] pledged to be married
[1518.94 → 1519.72] to a man
[1519.72 → 1520.36] named Joseph
[1520.36 → 1522.00] a descendant of David
[1522.00 → 1523.84] The virgin's name
[1523.84 → 1524.52] was Mary
[1524.52 → 1526.86] The angel
[1526.86 → 1527.52] went to her
[1527.52 → 1528.08] and said
[1528.08 → 1529.32] Greetings
[1529.32 → 1530.60] you who are
[1530.60 → 1531.54] highly favoured
[1531.54 → 1533.02] the Lord is with you
[1533.02 → 1534.78] Mary was greatly
[1534.78 → 1536.06] troubled at his words
[1536.06 → 1536.50] and wondered
[1536.50 → 1537.30] what kind of greeting
[1537.30 → 1538.08] this might be
[1538.08 → 1539.26] But the angel
[1539.26 → 1539.86] said to her
[1539.86 → 1541.24] Do not be afraid Mary
[1541.24 → 1542.40] you have found
[1542.40 → 1543.60] favour with God
[1543.60 → 1545.94] You will conceive
[1545.94 → 1546.78] and give birth
[1546.78 → 1547.46] to a son
[1547.46 → 1548.50] and you are to
[1548.50 → 1549.74] call him Jesus
[1549.74 → 1551.32] He will be great
[1551.32 → 1552.04] and will be called
[1552.04 → 1553.46] the Son of the Most High
[1553.46 → 1554.98] The Lord God
[1554.98 → 1555.60] will give him
[1555.60 → 1556.08] the throne
[1556.08 → 1557.10] of his father David
[1557.10 → 1558.28] and he will reign
[1558.28 → 1559.58] over Jacob's descendants
[1559.58 → 1560.30] forever
[1560.30 → 1561.54] His kingdom
[1561.54 → 1563.16] will never end
[1563.16 → 1565.42] How will this be
[1565.42 → 1566.18] Mary asked
[1566.18 → 1566.78] the angel
[1566.78 → 1567.70] since
[1567.70 → 1568.80] I am a virgin
[1568.80 → 1570.80] The angel answered
[1570.80 → 1572.04] The Holy Spirit
[1572.04 → 1572.98] will come on you
[1572.98 → 1574.00] and the power
[1574.00 → 1574.88] of the Most High
[1574.88 → 1576.08] will overshadow you
[1576.08 → 1577.44] So the Holy One
[1577.44 → 1578.10] to be born
[1578.10 → 1579.10] will be called
[1579.10 → 1580.58] the Son of God
[1580.58 → 1583.40] Even Elizabeth
[1583.40 → 1584.12] your relative
[1584.12 → 1584.90] is going to have
[1584.90 → 1585.36] a child
[1585.36 → 1586.48] in her old age
[1586.48 → 1587.72] and she
[1587.72 → 1588.62] who was said
[1588.62 → 1589.36] to be unable
[1589.36 → 1590.02] to conceive
[1590.02 → 1591.96] is in her sixth month
[1591.96 → 1593.22] for no word
[1593.22 → 1593.72] from God
[1593.72 → 1594.64] will ever fail
[1594.64 → 1597.20] I am the Lord's servant
[1597.20 → 1597.90] Mary answered
[1597.90 → 1599.02] May your word
[1599.02 → 1599.84] to me
[1599.84 → 1601.26] be fulfilled
[1601.26 → 1602.66] Then the angel
[1602.66 → 1603.28] left her
[1603.28 → 1605.08] This is the word
[1605.08 → 1605.54] of the Lord
[1605.54 → 1607.50] Thanks be to God
[1607.50 → 1608.22] Alright
[1608.22 → 1609.04] let's pray together
[1609.04 → 1612.16] Our Heavenly Father
[1612.16 → 1612.56] we
[1612.56 → 1614.58] come before you
[1614.58 → 1615.16] this morning
[1615.16 → 1615.80] Lord we
[1615.80 → 1617.90] we ask that you
[1617.90 → 1618.58] would help us
[1618.58 → 1619.06] to
[1619.06 → 1620.94] hear this story
[1620.94 → 1621.44] afresh
[1621.44 → 1622.34] It's a familiar
[1622.34 → 1623.70] story to many of us
[1623.70 → 1625.00] but Lord
[1625.00 → 1625.56] your word
[1625.56 → 1626.28] is always
[1626.28 → 1627.56] alive and active
[1627.56 → 1628.76] and Lord
[1628.76 → 1629.52] it comes to us
[1629.52 → 1630.02] this morning
[1630.02 → 1631.04] as we hear it
[1631.04 → 1631.48] afresh
[1631.48 → 1632.46] So Lord
[1632.46 → 1633.38] illumine our hearts
[1633.38 → 1634.04] and our minds
[1634.04 → 1634.94] and help us to
[1634.94 → 1636.22] learn about
[1636.22 → 1636.86] your grace
[1636.86 → 1637.34] this morning
[1637.34 → 1638.60] we pray in Jesus name
[1638.60 → 1639.16] Amen
[1639.16 → 1641.62] So to start off
[1641.62 → 1642.48] I want to share
[1642.48 → 1643.52] with you a story
[1643.52 → 1644.88] told by Eugene Peterson
[1644.88 → 1646.44] So he tells
[1646.44 → 1647.38] about a time
[1647.38 → 1649.92] as a small boy
[1649.92 → 1650.62] growing up
[1650.62 → 1651.18] in Montana
[1651.18 → 1652.90] when he would
[1652.90 → 1653.76] walk across
[1653.76 → 1654.36] the meadow
[1654.36 → 1656.06] to the fenced
[1656.06 → 1656.90] in fields
[1656.90 → 1657.92] of a farmer
[1657.92 → 1659.84] named Leonard Storm
[1659.84 → 1662.32] So Farmer Storm
[1662.32 → 1664.30] was this huge
[1664.30 → 1666.28] forbidding Norwegian
[1666.28 → 1667.82] whom Eugene
[1667.82 → 1669.56] was as a little boy
[1669.56 → 1671.18] in awe of
[1671.18 → 1672.56] and in fear of
[1672.56 → 1674.44] Eugene would stand
[1674.44 → 1675.98] at the barbed wire fence
[1675.98 → 1677.90] and watch Farmer Storm
[1677.90 → 1679.24] plow his fields
[1679.24 → 1680.28] on an enormous
[1680.28 → 1681.22] John Deere tractor
[1681.22 → 1683.00] Eugene said
[1683.00 → 1683.46] that more than
[1683.46 → 1684.30] anything else
[1684.30 → 1685.82] he wanted to get
[1685.82 → 1686.64] a ride
[1686.64 → 1687.86] on that tractor
[1687.86 → 1690.26] and so on summer day
[1690.26 → 1690.74] when he was
[1690.74 → 1691.60] five years old
[1691.60 → 1692.52] he was standing
[1692.52 → 1693.28] at the fence
[1693.28 → 1693.98] watching
[1693.98 → 1695.24] Farmer Storm
[1695.24 → 1697.30] and Eugene said
[1697.30 → 1697.92] Farmer Storm
[1697.92 → 1699.38] saw him
[1699.38 → 1699.92] he stopped
[1699.92 → 1700.48] his tractor
[1700.48 → 1701.64] he stood up
[1701.64 → 1702.28] in his seat
[1702.28 → 1703.10] and he made
[1703.10 → 1703.92] these big
[1703.92 → 1705.78] windmill motions
[1705.78 → 1707.20] with his arms
[1707.20 → 1709.74] Eugene said
[1709.74 → 1710.66] he looked
[1710.66 → 1711.86] angry and mean
[1711.86 → 1713.48] he looked
[1713.48 → 1714.34] so big
[1714.34 → 1715.06] in his bib
[1715.06 → 1715.82] overalls
[1715.82 → 1716.72] his straw hat
[1716.72 → 1718.36] Leonard Storm
[1718.36 → 1719.16] was yelling
[1719.16 → 1720.48] to Eugene
[1720.48 → 1721.02] but Eugene
[1721.02 → 1721.94] couldn't make out
[1721.94 → 1722.68] what he was saying
[1722.68 → 1724.20] he knew
[1724.20 → 1724.78] he probably
[1724.78 → 1725.58] shouldn't be there
[1725.58 → 1726.94] so scared
[1726.94 → 1728.14] and sad
[1728.14 → 1729.66] he turned away
[1729.66 → 1730.76] and went home
[1730.76 → 1732.88] and so that Sunday
[1732.88 → 1734.06] Leonard Storm
[1734.06 → 1735.10] who went to the same church
[1735.10 → 1736.20] as Eugene's family
[1736.20 → 1737.74] called him over
[1737.74 → 1738.40] after worship
[1738.40 → 1738.90] and said
[1738.90 → 1739.70] little Pete
[1739.70 → 1741.36] why didn't you come out
[1741.36 → 1742.44] to the field Thursday
[1742.44 → 1743.24] and ride the tractor
[1743.24 → 1743.70] with me
[1743.70 → 1745.40] Eugene said
[1745.40 → 1747.32] he didn't know
[1747.32 → 1748.30] he could have
[1748.30 → 1749.22] he thought
[1749.22 → 1750.54] he was being chased away
[1750.54 → 1752.76] Leonard Storm said
[1752.76 → 1753.96] I waved for you
[1753.96 → 1754.38] to come
[1754.38 → 1755.34] why didn't you come
[1755.34 → 1756.84] Eugene said
[1756.84 → 1757.44] he didn't know
[1757.44 → 1758.92] that's what he was doing
[1758.92 → 1759.64] with his big
[1759.64 → 1760.92] windmill arms
[1760.92 → 1762.40] so Leonard Storm
[1762.40 → 1763.06] asked Eugene
[1763.06 → 1764.46] well what do you do
[1764.46 → 1765.16] when you want somebody
[1765.16 → 1765.84] to come to you
[1765.84 → 1767.22] and Eugene said
[1767.22 → 1768.22] I go like this
[1768.22 → 1770.30] and
[1770.30 → 1771.94] Leonard Storm
[1771.94 → 1772.46] laughed
[1772.46 → 1773.22] and said
[1773.22 → 1774.92] that's piddling
[1774.92 → 1775.66] little Pete
[1775.66 → 1776.98] on the farm
[1776.98 → 1778.38] we do things big
[1778.38 → 1780.88] Eugene said
[1780.88 → 1782.38] he felt crushed
[1782.38 → 1783.48] he felt so
[1783.48 → 1784.68] small
[1784.68 → 1785.46] and piddling
[1785.46 → 1787.44] well a few days later
[1787.44 → 1788.02] he went back
[1788.02 → 1788.76] to the fence
[1788.76 → 1789.80] watching
[1789.80 → 1790.94] and hoping
[1790.94 → 1792.12] to get a second chance
[1792.12 → 1793.82] Farmer Storm
[1793.82 → 1794.60] saw him
[1794.60 → 1796.34] stopped the tractor
[1796.34 → 1797.88] and made the same
[1797.88 → 1799.02] great giant
[1799.02 → 1800.66] sweeping motions
[1800.66 → 1801.46] with his arms
[1801.46 → 1802.48] that Eugene
[1802.48 → 1803.14] now understood
[1803.14 → 1803.74] as
[1803.74 → 1804.86] an invitation
[1804.86 → 1806.74] this time Eugene
[1806.74 → 1807.10] said
[1807.10 → 1807.68] he was through
[1807.68 → 1808.14] the fence
[1808.14 → 1808.74] in a flash
[1808.74 → 1809.94] running across
[1809.94 → 1810.50] the field
[1810.50 → 1811.46] bounding up
[1811.46 → 1812.40] into the big
[1812.40 → 1813.00] green tractor
[1813.00 → 1813.96] with the yellow seat
[1813.96 → 1815.50] he said
[1815.50 → 1816.24] Leonard Storm
[1816.24 → 1816.88] let me stand
[1816.88 → 1817.62] in front of him
[1817.62 → 1818.80] holding the steering
[1818.80 → 1819.16] wheel
[1819.16 → 1820.28] plowing
[1820.28 → 1821.88] down the long
[1821.88 → 1822.80] stretch of field
[1822.80 → 1824.92] my smallness
[1824.92 → 1826.02] absorbed
[1826.02 → 1826.62] into
[1826.62 → 1827.56] his
[1827.56 → 1828.30] largeness
[1828.30 → 1830.76] so I'm telling
[1830.76 → 1831.44] you this story
[1831.44 → 1832.92] because I think
[1832.92 → 1833.40] it's such a
[1833.40 → 1834.34] wonderful picture
[1834.34 → 1835.74] of what's happening
[1835.74 → 1836.84] to Mary
[1836.84 → 1838.32] in our passage
[1838.32 → 1839.96] God is
[1839.96 → 1841.18] he's like waving
[1841.18 → 1842.06] his big
[1842.06 → 1843.72] windmill arms
[1843.72 → 1844.78] inviting
[1844.78 → 1845.46] Mary
[1845.46 → 1846.64] and us
[1846.64 → 1847.02] today
[1847.02 → 1847.88] inviting us
[1847.88 → 1848.74] into
[1848.74 → 1850.36] the largeness
[1850.36 → 1851.46] of God's story
[1851.46 → 1852.22] and the largeness
[1852.22 → 1853.18] of his grace
[1853.18 → 1853.90] right
[1853.90 → 1855.10] calling each of us
[1855.10 → 1855.58] from our
[1855.58 → 1856.12] small
[1856.12 → 1856.72] piddling
[1856.72 → 1857.96] lives
[1857.96 → 1859.20] into
[1859.20 → 1860.58] comparatively
[1860.58 → 1862.14] the largeness
[1862.14 → 1864.00] of his life
[1864.00 → 1865.58] calling us
[1865.58 → 1866.10] from our
[1866.10 → 1867.42] small imaginations
[1867.42 → 1868.26] of what's possible
[1868.26 → 1868.64] and of
[1868.64 → 1869.86] who God is
[1869.86 → 1870.96] into the
[1870.96 → 1872.06] grand story
[1872.06 → 1872.58] of what God
[1872.58 → 1872.98] is doing
[1872.98 → 1873.56] in the world
[1873.56 → 1875.46] and friends
[1875.46 → 1876.26] I want to suggest
[1876.26 → 1877.16] to us this morning
[1877.16 → 1877.94] that this is
[1877.94 → 1878.84] what we long for
[1878.84 → 1880.06] right
[1880.06 → 1880.76] we long
[1880.76 → 1881.78] for God
[1881.78 → 1883.40] to show us
[1883.40 → 1884.04] his favour
[1884.04 → 1885.94] to stand up
[1885.94 → 1887.68] and look upon us
[1887.68 → 1888.96] and to invite us
[1888.96 → 1889.72] into his presence
[1889.72 → 1890.74] and to invite us
[1890.74 → 1891.88] to enter
[1891.88 → 1892.78] into
[1892.78 → 1894.04] the grandness
[1894.04 → 1894.86] of his story
[1894.86 → 1897.08] so this morning
[1897.08 → 1898.06] I want us to see
[1898.06 → 1898.92] how God
[1898.92 → 1899.66] fulfills
[1899.66 → 1900.50] our longing
[1900.50 → 1901.06] for grace
[1901.06 → 1902.10] in three different ways
[1902.10 → 1904.00] first in this passage
[1904.00 → 1905.32] we see that grace
[1905.32 → 1906.10] comes to
[1906.10 → 1907.88] unexpected people
[1907.88 → 1909.48] kind of like us
[1909.48 → 1910.96] grace also
[1910.96 → 1912.00] comes to us
[1912.00 → 1913.28] in ways
[1913.28 → 1913.76] that we would
[1913.76 → 1914.68] never expect
[1914.68 → 1916.54] and God's grace
[1916.54 → 1917.48] also lastly
[1917.48 → 1918.46] pulls us
[1918.46 → 1919.36] into his story
[1919.36 → 1920.72] into this
[1920.72 → 1922.20] unexpected story
[1922.20 → 1922.88] that we also
[1922.88 → 1923.72] could never imagine
[1923.72 → 1925.00] okay so those
[1925.00 → 1925.52] are three things
[1925.52 → 1926.14] we're going to look at
[1926.14 → 1926.78] so let's look at
[1926.78 → 1927.68] the passage together
[1927.68 → 1929.48] and first we see
[1929.48 → 1930.70] that God's grace
[1930.70 → 1931.26] comes to
[1931.26 → 1932.48] unexpected people
[1932.48 → 1934.42] so now
[1934.42 → 1935.84] when the angel
[1935.84 → 1936.48] Gabriel
[1936.48 → 1937.58] visits Mary
[1937.58 → 1938.16] he's coming
[1938.16 → 1938.86] as a messenger
[1938.86 → 1939.92] he's bearing news
[1939.92 → 1941.84] but he does not
[1941.84 → 1942.68] begin with
[1942.68 → 1943.22] he doesn't come
[1943.22 → 1943.98] to Mary and say
[1943.98 → 1945.18] guess what Mary
[1945.18 → 1945.70] you're going to
[1945.70 → 1946.32] have a baby
[1946.32 → 1947.66] congratulations
[1947.66 → 1948.22] you know
[1948.22 → 1948.96] and pop the little
[1948.96 → 1949.72] streamer things
[1949.72 → 1950.92] that's not
[1950.92 → 1951.60] what he does
[1951.60 → 1952.80] but if we look
[1952.80 → 1953.66] at verse 28
[1953.66 → 1954.52] up on the screen
[1954.52 → 1956.34] the angel
[1956.34 → 1957.38] went to her
[1957.38 → 1958.02] and said
[1958.02 → 1959.02] greetings
[1959.02 → 1960.50] you who are
[1960.50 → 1961.50] highly favoured
[1961.50 → 1962.76] the Lord
[1962.76 → 1964.04] is with you
[1964.04 → 1966.36] and so the word
[1966.36 → 1967.04] favoured
[1967.04 → 1968.68] is in fact
[1968.68 → 1969.46] the same word
[1969.46 → 1969.94] that we find
[1969.94 → 1970.96] throughout the Old Testament
[1970.96 → 1971.50] or sorry
[1971.50 → 1972.40] throughout the New Testament
[1972.40 → 1974.38] for the word grace
[1974.38 → 1977.38] so a literal translation
[1977.38 → 1978.34] would be
[1978.34 → 1979.20] greetings
[1979.20 → 1981.34] you who are
[1981.34 → 1982.58] graced
[1982.58 → 1983.64] you who are
[1983.64 → 1984.68] full of grace
[1984.68 → 1986.94] and it doesn't mean
[1986.94 → 1987.96] though that Mary
[1987.96 → 1989.04] has grace
[1989.04 → 1989.84] in herself
[1989.84 → 1991.70] she doesn't have it
[1991.70 → 1992.16] already
[1992.16 → 1992.76] but rather
[1992.76 → 1993.40] God
[1993.40 → 1994.40] when God
[1994.40 → 1995.28] comes to Mary
[1995.28 → 1996.68] he bestows
[1996.68 → 1997.22] his grace
[1997.22 → 1997.80] upon her
[1997.80 → 1999.72] so in other words
[1999.72 → 2000.68] the important point
[2000.68 → 2001.68] isn't just the fact
[2001.68 → 2002.18] that she's going
[2002.18 → 2002.76] to give birth
[2002.76 → 2005.02] the important part
[2005.02 → 2006.22] is that
[2006.22 → 2006.82] the Lord
[2006.82 → 2008.40] has come to you
[2008.40 → 2009.98] with his grace
[2009.98 → 2010.82] and it says
[2010.82 → 2011.34] the Lord
[2011.34 → 2012.12] is with you
[2012.12 → 2014.22] and so
[2014.22 → 2015.26] one commentary
[2015.26 → 2016.68] put it this way
[2016.68 → 2017.64] and he's just
[2017.64 → 2018.56] speaking to this
[2018.56 → 2019.34] whole notion
[2019.34 → 2021.64] of the unmerited
[2021.64 → 2022.92] favour and grace
[2022.92 → 2023.92] that was coming
[2023.92 → 2024.42] to Mary
[2024.42 → 2026.64] it says this
[2026.64 → 2028.08] Mary
[2028.08 → 2029.26] is young
[2029.26 → 2030.76] in a world
[2030.76 → 2032.02] that values age
[2032.02 → 2033.20] and so
[2033.20 → 2034.40] this is kind of
[2034.40 → 2034.94] different from
[2034.94 → 2035.98] our culture
[2035.98 → 2036.90] because
[2036.90 → 2038.14] in our culture
[2038.14 → 2039.32] we value
[2039.32 → 2040.02] youth
[2040.02 → 2042.06] but their culture
[2042.06 → 2042.90] actually valued
[2042.90 → 2043.52] age
[2043.52 → 2046.20] so Mary
[2046.20 → 2046.78] was young
[2046.78 → 2047.64] she was a young
[2047.64 → 2048.30] teenage girl
[2048.30 → 2050.00] but then it keeps going
[2050.00 → 2051.34] she was female
[2051.34 → 2052.16] in a world
[2052.16 → 2052.98] ruled by men
[2052.98 → 2054.90] she was poor
[2054.90 → 2055.92] in a stratified
[2055.92 → 2056.50] economy
[2056.50 → 2058.24] furthermore
[2058.24 → 2059.44] she has neither
[2059.44 → 2060.58] husband or child
[2060.58 → 2061.18] to validate
[2061.18 → 2061.84] her existence
[2061.84 → 2062.56] in that culture
[2062.56 → 2064.38] that she
[2064.38 → 2064.88] could find
[2064.88 → 2065.72] favour with God
[2065.72 → 2066.42] and be highly
[2066.42 → 2067.02] graced
[2067.02 → 2068.40] shows Luke's
[2068.40 → 2069.02] understanding
[2069.02 → 2069.54] of God's
[2069.54 → 2070.02] activity
[2070.02 → 2071.34] as surprising
[2071.34 → 2072.22] and often
[2072.22 → 2073.46] paradoxical
[2073.46 → 2074.94] almost always
[2074.94 → 2075.64] reversing
[2075.64 → 2076.58] human
[2076.58 → 2077.64] expectations
[2077.64 → 2079.08] right
[2079.08 → 2079.44] and friends
[2079.44 → 2079.74] that's what
[2079.74 → 2080.38] grace does
[2080.38 → 2081.44] right
[2081.44 → 2082.32] it reverses
[2082.32 → 2082.72] human
[2082.72 → 2083.56] expectations
[2083.56 → 2084.54] because the way
[2084.54 → 2085.88] we think
[2085.88 → 2086.26] the world
[2086.26 → 2086.68] works
[2086.68 → 2087.30] is that
[2087.30 → 2088.04] we need
[2088.04 → 2088.78] to earn
[2088.78 → 2089.24] favour
[2089.24 → 2089.58] we need
[2089.58 → 2089.98] to earn
[2089.98 → 2090.52] grace
[2090.52 → 2091.06] you know
[2091.06 → 2091.40] there are
[2091.40 → 2091.94] people who
[2091.94 → 2092.40] are
[2092.40 → 2093.94] prove themselves
[2093.94 → 2095.06] in the world
[2095.06 → 2095.78] to be
[2095.78 → 2096.76] you know
[2096.76 → 2097.78] people we would
[2097.78 → 2099.28] look up to
[2099.28 → 2100.30] or have awe of
[2100.30 → 2101.18] and there are
[2101.18 → 2102.66] those who don't
[2102.66 → 2104.64] but God's grace
[2104.64 → 2105.98] reverses
[2105.98 → 2107.08] human expectations
[2107.08 → 2108.50] because it's
[2108.50 → 2109.02] something
[2109.02 → 2110.24] that's freely
[2110.24 → 2111.14] given to us
[2111.14 → 2112.40] even when we
[2112.40 → 2113.24] don't deserve it
[2113.24 → 2114.22] and so Mary
[2114.22 → 2114.64] here
[2114.64 → 2116.02] she has nothing
[2116.02 → 2116.78] to commend
[2116.78 → 2117.34] herself
[2117.34 → 2118.70] she's a young
[2118.70 → 2119.04] girl
[2119.04 → 2120.74] from a backwater
[2120.74 → 2121.26] town
[2121.26 → 2122.34] not in Jerusalem
[2122.34 → 2123.08] not at the
[2123.08 → 2123.42] temple
[2123.42 → 2125.08] why on earth
[2125.08 → 2125.62] would God
[2125.62 → 2126.64] go to her
[2126.64 → 2128.10] and there is no
[2128.10 → 2129.06] reason humanly
[2129.06 → 2129.50] speaking
[2129.50 → 2132.02] so in verse
[2132.02 → 2132.64] 29
[2132.64 → 2134.60] after Gabriel
[2134.60 → 2135.32] gives her this
[2135.32 → 2135.64] greeting
[2135.64 → 2136.50] it says this
[2136.50 → 2137.96] Mary was
[2137.96 → 2139.08] greatly troubled
[2139.08 → 2139.98] at his words
[2139.98 → 2140.38] and wondered
[2140.38 → 2141.06] what kind of
[2141.06 → 2141.38] greeting
[2141.38 → 2142.90] this might be
[2142.90 → 2144.92] and so notice
[2144.92 → 2146.54] that she hasn't
[2146.54 → 2147.30] gotten the news
[2147.30 → 2147.50] yet
[2147.50 → 2148.24] she's going to
[2148.24 → 2148.82] bear God's
[2148.82 → 2149.16] child
[2149.16 → 2149.96] so she's not
[2149.96 → 2150.50] like completely
[2150.50 → 2151.36] shocked yet
[2151.36 → 2152.82] about the baby
[2152.82 → 2154.16] that's not what's
[2154.16 → 2154.78] troubling her
[2154.78 → 2155.48] it says she's
[2155.48 → 2155.84] troubled
[2155.84 → 2157.12] by the greeting
[2157.12 → 2158.38] she's like
[2158.38 → 2159.84] who me
[2159.84 → 2160.70] right
[2160.70 → 2161.80] I'm favoured
[2161.80 → 2162.54] by God
[2162.54 → 2163.96] I don't deserve
[2163.96 → 2164.60] this at all
[2164.60 → 2166.12] I'm just a girl
[2166.12 → 2167.02] living in the country
[2167.02 → 2168.28] I'm not anybody
[2168.28 → 2169.32] of any importance
[2169.32 → 2171.28] and yet God
[2171.28 → 2172.02] comes to her
[2172.02 → 2172.48] and says
[2172.48 → 2172.84] Mary
[2172.84 → 2173.58] I am giving
[2173.58 → 2174.24] you my grace
[2174.24 → 2174.72] and favour
[2174.72 → 2175.70] the Lord
[2175.70 → 2176.36] is with you
[2176.36 → 2177.98] right
[2177.98 → 2178.42] so there's
[2178.42 → 2179.16] nothing special
[2179.16 → 2179.94] about Mary
[2179.94 → 2181.80] except that
[2181.80 → 2182.96] God chooses
[2182.96 → 2183.34] her
[2183.34 → 2184.66] he chooses
[2184.66 → 2185.46] to love her
[2185.46 → 2186.44] and to bestow
[2186.44 → 2186.96] his grace
[2186.96 → 2187.56] upon her
[2187.56 → 2189.24] and that's how
[2189.24 → 2190.08] grace comes to us
[2190.08 → 2190.50] as well
[2190.50 → 2191.64] you know
[2191.64 → 2191.90] friends
[2191.90 → 2192.66] we don't do
[2192.66 → 2193.38] anything to earn
[2193.38 → 2194.00] God's grace
[2194.00 → 2194.74] God doesn't look
[2194.74 → 2195.16] at us
[2195.16 → 2195.66] and say
[2195.66 → 2196.64] you know
[2196.64 → 2198.62] this person
[2198.62 → 2199.54] is so wonderful
[2199.54 → 2201.04] he or she
[2201.04 → 2201.70] has earned
[2201.70 → 2202.38] my grace
[2202.38 → 2202.80] that's not
[2202.80 → 2203.48] what happens
[2203.48 → 2204.58] but
[2204.58 → 2205.32] Christianity
[2205.32 → 2205.94] says
[2205.94 → 2206.46] we don't do
[2206.46 → 2207.18] anything to earn
[2207.18 → 2207.38] it
[2207.38 → 2208.04] but God
[2208.04 → 2208.70] in his love
[2208.70 → 2209.32] and mercy
[2209.32 → 2210.94] offers his grace
[2210.94 → 2211.60] to us freely
[2211.60 → 2214.10] you know
[2214.10 → 2214.94] so I heard
[2214.94 → 2215.62] a story
[2215.62 → 2216.10] about a little
[2216.10 → 2216.40] boy
[2216.40 → 2217.96] and you may
[2217.96 → 2218.40] know there's
[2218.40 → 2218.86] this program
[2218.86 → 2219.74] called Angel
[2219.74 → 2220.08] Tree
[2220.08 → 2221.90] and so around
[2221.90 → 2222.42] Christmastime
[2222.42 → 2223.08] they put up a
[2223.08 → 2223.76] Christmas tree
[2223.76 → 2225.08] in a public
[2225.08 → 2225.54] place
[2225.54 → 2226.90] and they hang
[2226.90 → 2227.54] angels
[2227.54 → 2228.84] on the tree
[2228.84 → 2229.82] with the name
[2229.82 → 2230.56] of a child
[2230.56 → 2231.02] of someone
[2231.02 → 2231.50] who is in
[2231.50 → 2231.82] prison
[2231.82 → 2232.66] and also
[2232.66 → 2233.82] on the angel
[2233.82 → 2234.38] they write
[2234.38 → 2234.96] the gift
[2234.96 → 2235.68] that the child
[2235.68 → 2236.72] wishes to
[2236.72 → 2237.40] receive
[2237.40 → 2238.14] for Christmas
[2238.14 → 2239.56] and so people
[2239.56 → 2240.02] can go
[2240.02 → 2240.40] and they can
[2240.40 → 2240.96] take an angel
[2240.96 → 2241.70] off the tree
[2241.70 → 2242.68] and they can
[2242.68 → 2243.52] buy a gift
[2243.52 → 2244.88] to help
[2244.88 → 2246.04] a prisoner's
[2246.04 → 2246.64] child get
[2246.64 → 2247.12] something for
[2247.12 → 2247.42] Christmas
[2247.42 → 2249.50] so there was
[2249.50 → 2250.02] this one of
[2250.02 → 2250.90] these angel
[2250.90 → 2251.46] trees
[2251.46 → 2253.00] in a mall
[2253.00 → 2254.08] in North Carolina
[2254.08 → 2255.24] it was in a
[2255.24 → 2255.92] beautiful spot
[2255.92 → 2256.30] in the mall
[2256.30 → 2256.82] right in the
[2256.82 → 2257.62] centre by the
[2257.62 → 2257.98] fountain
[2257.98 → 2260.06] and a little
[2260.06 → 2260.84] boy named
[2260.84 → 2261.44] Damien
[2261.44 → 2262.96] had an angel
[2262.96 → 2263.96] on that tree
[2263.96 → 2265.36] so Damien
[2265.36 → 2266.02] every day
[2266.02 → 2266.80] would walk
[2266.80 → 2268.10] to the mall
[2268.10 → 2269.30] go in
[2269.30 → 2270.06] look at the
[2270.06 → 2270.28] tree
[2270.28 → 2270.78] to see
[2270.78 → 2271.22] if his
[2271.22 → 2271.52] angel
[2271.52 → 2271.88] was still
[2271.88 → 2272.18] there
[2272.18 → 2273.40] so every
[2273.40 → 2273.78] day he
[2273.78 → 2274.36] would walk
[2274.36 → 2275.32] to see
[2275.32 → 2275.62] if his
[2275.62 → 2275.92] angel
[2275.92 → 2276.24] had been
[2276.24 → 2276.58] taken
[2276.58 → 2278.14] but every
[2278.14 → 2278.66] day he
[2278.66 → 2279.06] went
[2279.06 → 2279.92] it was
[2279.92 → 2280.42] still there
[2280.42 → 2282.06] nobody
[2282.06 → 2283.16] picked him
[2283.16 → 2284.50] so the
[2284.50 → 2285.08] next day
[2285.08 → 2285.88] he walked
[2285.88 → 2286.42] the mall
[2286.42 → 2287.64] he checked
[2287.64 → 2288.28] again
[2288.28 → 2289.16] nobody
[2289.16 → 2290.08] had picked
[2290.08 → 2290.34] him
[2290.34 → 2291.98] and then
[2291.98 → 2292.38] came the
[2292.38 → 2292.96] day when
[2292.96 → 2293.48] he walked
[2293.48 → 2294.04] into the
[2294.04 → 2294.44] mall
[2294.44 → 2295.56] and his
[2295.56 → 2295.98] angel
[2295.98 → 2296.62] was gone
[2296.62 → 2297.68] and he
[2297.68 → 2298.12] was so
[2298.12 → 2298.60] excited
[2298.60 → 2299.38] that he
[2299.38 → 2300.36] ran
[2300.36 → 2301.02] into
[2301.02 → 2301.84] the
[2301.84 → 2302.58] volunteer
[2302.58 → 2303.14] kind of
[2303.14 → 2303.78] threw himself
[2303.78 → 2304.44] into her
[2304.44 → 2304.84] arms
[2304.84 → 2305.76] and both
[2305.76 → 2306.14] of them
[2306.14 → 2306.50] fell
[2306.50 → 2307.06] backwards
[2307.06 → 2308.08] into the
[2308.08 → 2308.40] fountain
[2308.40 → 2312.46] you know
[2312.46 → 2313.50] we're all
[2313.50 → 2314.34] longing for
[2314.34 → 2314.72] grace
[2314.72 → 2315.16] aren't we
[2315.16 → 2316.42] right
[2316.42 → 2317.16] we long
[2317.16 → 2317.98] for some
[2317.98 → 2318.90] wonderful
[2318.90 → 2319.64] favour
[2319.64 → 2320.48] that we
[2320.48 → 2320.98] know that
[2320.98 → 2321.38] we don't
[2321.38 → 2321.74] deserve
[2321.74 → 2322.28] to come
[2322.28 → 2322.78] into our
[2322.78 → 2323.18] lives
[2323.18 → 2324.78] and that's
[2324.78 → 2325.28] what happens
[2325.28 → 2325.60] when you
[2325.60 → 2326.04] become a
[2326.04 → 2326.36] Christian
[2326.36 → 2327.20] right
[2327.20 → 2327.62] you say
[2327.62 → 2328.22] I can't
[2328.22 → 2328.54] believe
[2328.54 → 2328.86] out of
[2328.86 → 2330.18] all people
[2330.18 → 2331.10] that God
[2331.10 → 2331.68] picked me
[2331.68 → 2333.08] I can't
[2333.08 → 2333.74] believe
[2333.74 → 2334.58] that God
[2334.58 → 2335.08] has poured
[2335.08 → 2335.54] his grace
[2335.54 → 2336.06] out upon
[2336.06 → 2336.38] me
[2336.38 → 2338.72] so friends
[2338.72 → 2339.28] to be a
[2339.28 → 2339.64] Christian
[2339.64 → 2340.24] means
[2340.24 → 2341.66] that you
[2341.66 → 2342.14] receive
[2342.14 → 2342.50] God's
[2342.50 → 2342.88] grace
[2342.88 → 2344.06] so
[2344.06 → 2344.76] God's
[2344.76 → 2344.96] grace
[2344.96 → 2345.46] comes to
[2345.46 → 2346.04] unexpected
[2346.04 → 2346.66] people
[2346.66 → 2347.30] even
[2347.30 → 2347.88] us
[2347.88 → 2350.98] but not
[2350.98 → 2351.40] only that
[2351.40 → 2351.78] the second
[2351.78 → 2352.28] thing we see
[2352.28 → 2352.50] in this
[2352.50 → 2353.20] passage is
[2353.20 → 2353.82] that God's
[2353.82 → 2354.12] grace
[2354.12 → 2354.88] comes
[2354.88 → 2355.98] not only
[2355.98 → 2356.82] do people
[2356.82 → 2357.72] that we
[2357.72 → 2358.28] don't expect
[2358.28 → 2358.90] like Mary
[2358.90 → 2359.54] like us
[2359.54 → 2360.50] but also
[2360.50 → 2361.36] in ways
[2361.36 → 2361.88] that we
[2361.88 → 2362.44] would never
[2362.44 → 2363.08] expect
[2363.08 → 2364.82] and so
[2364.82 → 2365.40] we see
[2365.40 → 2365.86] here the
[2365.86 → 2366.76] angel Gabriel
[2366.76 → 2367.88] tells Mary
[2367.88 → 2368.90] that she
[2368.90 → 2369.50] will bear
[2369.50 → 2370.14] a son
[2370.14 → 2371.38] and she
[2371.38 → 2372.02] will name
[2372.02 → 2372.54] him
[2372.54 → 2373.48] Jesus
[2373.48 → 2374.68] and he
[2374.68 → 2375.00] will be
[2375.00 → 2375.62] the son
[2375.62 → 2376.26] of God
[2376.26 → 2377.74] I mean
[2377.74 → 2378.76] this is
[2378.76 → 2380.00] incredible
[2380.00 → 2380.66] news
[2380.66 → 2381.62] she's going
[2381.62 → 2382.02] to be
[2382.02 → 2382.76] the mother
[2382.76 → 2383.40] of God
[2383.40 → 2385.12] and Mary's
[2385.12 → 2385.90] response is
[2385.90 → 2386.46] this on
[2386.46 → 2386.96] the screen
[2386.96 → 2388.18] he says
[2388.18 → 2389.70] how will
[2389.70 → 2390.64] this be
[2390.64 → 2391.92] asked
[2391.92 → 2392.50] the Mary
[2392.50 → 2392.92] asked the
[2392.92 → 2393.28] angel
[2393.28 → 2394.38] since I
[2394.38 → 2394.90] am a
[2394.90 → 2395.18] virgin
[2395.18 → 2397.24] so Mary's
[2397.24 → 2397.84] first thought
[2397.84 → 2398.20] is to
[2398.20 → 2398.88] say
[2398.88 → 2400.32] look there's
[2400.32 → 2400.92] an issue
[2400.92 → 2401.42] that needs
[2401.42 → 2401.66] to be
[2401.66 → 2401.98] addressed
[2401.98 → 2402.54] here Gabriel
[2402.54 → 2404.00] I know
[2404.00 → 2404.68] I'm young
[2404.68 → 2405.90] but I'm
[2405.90 → 2406.50] not naive
[2406.50 → 2407.08] right
[2407.08 → 2407.60] I know
[2407.60 → 2408.14] how babies
[2408.14 → 2408.52] are made
[2408.52 → 2409.04] so how
[2409.04 → 2409.38] is this
[2409.38 → 2409.78] going to
[2409.78 → 2410.10] work
[2410.10 → 2410.52] I'm
[2410.52 → 2410.92] a virgin
[2410.92 → 2412.24] so if
[2412.24 → 2412.72] you remember
[2412.72 → 2413.58] last week
[2413.58 → 2414.92] Zechariah
[2414.92 → 2415.76] in the
[2415.76 → 2416.20] temple
[2416.20 → 2417.92] asked Gabriel
[2417.92 → 2418.56] the same
[2418.56 → 2418.94] angel
[2418.94 → 2420.34] a question
[2420.34 → 2420.66] that is
[2420.66 → 2421.00] also
[2421.00 → 2422.02] very nearly
[2422.02 → 2422.62] the same
[2422.62 → 2424.50] and Gabriel
[2424.50 → 2425.52] identified the
[2425.52 → 2426.44] question in
[2426.44 → 2427.14] Zechariah
[2427.14 → 2428.22] as unbelief
[2428.22 → 2429.64] and made
[2429.64 → 2430.18] him mute
[2430.18 → 2432.48] but Mary's
[2432.48 → 2433.14] situation
[2433.14 → 2434.10] and Mary's
[2434.10 → 2434.68] heart
[2434.68 → 2435.76] are completely
[2435.76 → 2436.26] different
[2436.26 → 2437.18] from those
[2437.18 → 2437.90] of Zechariah
[2437.90 → 2439.26] Zechariah
[2439.26 → 2440.38] he knew
[2440.38 → 2440.94] from scripture
[2440.94 → 2442.12] that God
[2442.12 → 2442.92] was able
[2442.92 → 2443.64] to give
[2443.64 → 2444.60] an old
[2444.60 → 2445.36] barren couple
[2445.36 → 2446.02] a child
[2446.02 → 2446.96] he knew
[2446.96 → 2447.36] that
[2447.36 → 2448.34] but he
[2448.34 → 2448.92] doubted
[2448.92 → 2449.26] God
[2449.26 → 2449.90] he doubted
[2449.90 → 2450.32] that God
[2450.32 → 2451.24] would do
[2451.24 → 2451.66] what he
[2451.66 → 2452.16] just said
[2452.16 → 2452.46] he would
[2452.46 → 2452.74] do
[2452.74 → 2453.88] so his
[2453.88 → 2454.34] question
[2454.34 → 2454.74] was one
[2454.74 → 2455.22] of doubt
[2455.22 → 2456.48] but with
[2456.48 → 2456.96] Mary
[2456.96 → 2458.54] I mean
[2458.54 → 2459.00] think about
[2459.00 → 2459.18] it
[2459.18 → 2459.90] no one
[2459.90 → 2460.56] had ever
[2460.56 → 2461.12] heard
[2461.12 → 2462.10] or read
[2462.10 → 2462.58] in scripture
[2462.58 → 2464.24] the story
[2464.24 → 2465.22] of a virgin
[2465.22 → 2466.04] having a
[2466.04 → 2466.32] son
[2466.32 → 2468.06] so Mary
[2468.06 → 2468.80] she hears
[2468.80 → 2469.24] this
[2469.24 → 2470.48] there's no
[2470.48 → 2471.06] there's no
[2471.06 → 2471.68] way for her
[2471.68 → 2472.22] to imagine
[2472.22 → 2472.74] what this
[2472.74 → 2473.18] means
[2473.18 → 2474.44] she wasn't
[2474.44 → 2475.04] sure what
[2475.04 → 2475.56] her part
[2475.56 → 2475.96] was
[2475.96 → 2476.58] right
[2476.58 → 2477.18] what is
[2477.18 → 2477.56] she supposed
[2477.56 → 2478.06] to do
[2478.06 → 2479.08] so she
[2479.08 → 2479.54] asks
[2479.54 → 2480.06] God
[2480.06 → 2480.46] how are
[2480.46 → 2480.76] you going
[2480.76 → 2481.06] to do
[2481.06 → 2481.46] this
[2481.46 → 2482.72] you know
[2482.72 → 2483.24] and this
[2483.24 → 2483.72] is not
[2483.72 → 2484.40] a question
[2484.40 → 2484.94] of doubt
[2484.94 → 2485.40] in Mary
[2485.40 → 2485.86] it's actually
[2485.86 → 2486.36] just a very
[2486.36 → 2486.72] honest
[2486.72 → 2487.20] question
[2487.20 → 2489.16] maybe Mary's
[2489.16 → 2489.70] thinking that
[2489.70 → 2490.00] this will
[2490.00 → 2490.68] happen a few
[2490.68 → 2491.36] years from
[2491.36 → 2491.64] now
[2491.64 → 2492.32] maybe her
[2492.32 → 2492.82] and Joseph
[2492.82 → 2493.22] will get
[2493.22 → 2493.62] married
[2493.62 → 2494.10] they'll settle
[2494.10 → 2494.68] down
[2494.68 → 2495.74] Joseph's
[2495.74 → 2496.26] carpentry
[2496.26 → 2496.62] business
[2496.62 → 2497.16] will kind
[2497.16 → 2497.44] of get
[2497.44 → 2497.92] going
[2497.92 → 2498.90] save up
[2498.90 → 2499.46] some money
[2499.46 → 2500.72] then
[2500.72 → 2501.18] they can
[2501.18 → 2501.52] start a
[2501.52 → 2501.92] family
[2501.92 → 2503.16] and maybe
[2503.16 → 2503.52] one of
[2503.52 → 2504.06] those babies
[2504.06 → 2504.50] would turn
[2504.50 → 2504.82] out to be
[2504.82 → 2505.30] the Messiah
[2505.30 → 2507.22] but that
[2507.22 → 2507.68] would be
[2507.68 → 2508.36] Mary's
[2508.36 → 2508.68] kind of
[2508.68 → 2509.14] little
[2509.14 → 2509.86] piddling
[2509.86 → 2510.82] plan
[2510.82 → 2512.82] not God's
[2512.82 → 2513.72] windmill
[2513.72 → 2514.52] arms plan
[2514.52 → 2515.90] and so
[2515.90 → 2516.24] we see
[2516.24 → 2517.14] the angel
[2517.14 → 2518.52] answer her
[2518.52 → 2519.38] in the next
[2519.38 → 2519.98] passage
[2519.98 → 2523.10] the angel
[2523.10 → 2523.58] answered
[2523.58 → 2524.00] the Holy
[2524.00 → 2524.42] Spirit
[2524.42 → 2525.54] will come
[2525.54 → 2526.18] on you
[2526.18 → 2527.62] the power
[2527.62 → 2527.96] of the
[2527.96 → 2528.68] Most High
[2528.68 → 2529.84] will overshadow
[2529.84 → 2530.18] you
[2530.18 → 2531.18] so the
[2531.18 → 2531.72] Holy One
[2531.72 → 2532.00] to be
[2532.00 → 2532.28] born
[2532.28 → 2532.62] will be
[2532.62 → 2532.88] called
[2532.88 → 2533.34] the Son
[2533.34 → 2533.90] of God
[2533.90 → 2535.02] even
[2535.02 → 2535.46] Elizabeth
[2535.46 → 2536.12] your relative
[2536.12 → 2536.46] is going
[2536.46 → 2536.74] to have
[2536.74 → 2537.16] a child
[2537.16 → 2537.54] in her
[2537.54 → 2538.76] old age
[2538.76 → 2539.76] and she
[2539.76 → 2540.16] who is
[2540.16 → 2540.54] said to
[2540.54 → 2541.12] be unable
[2541.12 → 2541.68] to conceive
[2541.68 → 2542.26] is in
[2542.26 → 2542.64] her sixth
[2542.64 → 2542.96] month
[2542.96 → 2543.94] for no
[2543.94 → 2544.40] word
[2544.40 → 2545.20] from God
[2545.20 → 2545.74] will fail
[2545.74 → 2548.64] and so
[2548.64 → 2549.26] the angel
[2549.26 → 2549.70] is telling
[2549.70 → 2549.98] Mary
[2549.98 → 2550.46] this is
[2550.46 → 2550.86] not some
[2550.86 → 2551.20] future
[2551.20 → 2551.58] event
[2551.58 → 2553.36] and the
[2553.36 → 2553.70] first
[2553.70 → 2554.70] unexpected
[2554.70 → 2555.44] news
[2555.44 → 2556.42] is that
[2556.42 → 2556.74] Joseph
[2556.74 → 2557.22] will not
[2557.22 → 2557.88] be the
[2557.88 → 2558.38] biological
[2558.38 → 2558.94] father
[2558.94 → 2560.16] for this
[2560.16 → 2560.42] son
[2560.42 → 2561.42] Jesus
[2561.42 → 2561.88] will be
[2561.88 → 2562.22] born
[2562.22 → 2563.06] by the
[2563.06 → 2563.50] power
[2563.50 → 2563.96] of the
[2563.96 → 2564.14] Holy
[2564.14 → 2564.52] Spirit
[2564.52 → 2565.58] right
[2565.58 → 2565.84] it will
[2565.84 → 2566.22] be a
[2566.22 → 2566.76] miraculous
[2566.76 → 2567.38] conception
[2567.38 → 2568.50] and the
[2568.50 → 2568.92] result
[2568.92 → 2569.34] will be
[2569.34 → 2569.56] that
[2569.56 → 2569.88] Jesus
[2569.88 → 2570.30] will be
[2570.30 → 2570.54] the
[2570.54 → 2570.86] Holy
[2570.86 → 2571.12] Son
[2571.12 → 2571.58] of God
[2571.58 → 2573.14] and so
[2573.14 → 2573.54] friends
[2573.54 → 2574.02] Jesus
[2574.02 → 2575.22] will be
[2575.22 → 2576.04] a fully
[2576.04 → 2576.80] human
[2576.80 → 2577.30] being
[2577.30 → 2577.82] with a
[2577.82 → 2578.18] true
[2578.18 → 2578.56] human
[2578.56 → 2578.90] nature
[2578.90 → 2579.54] this is
[2579.54 → 2579.84] what we
[2579.84 → 2580.12] believe
[2580.12 → 2580.30] as
[2580.30 → 2580.70] Christians
[2580.70 → 2581.74] that
[2581.74 → 2582.30] Mary's
[2582.30 → 2582.80] blood
[2582.80 → 2583.88] would
[2583.88 → 2584.52] flow
[2584.52 → 2584.86] through
[2584.86 → 2585.20] his
[2585.20 → 2585.64] veins
[2585.64 → 2586.02] in the
[2586.02 → 2586.30] womb
[2586.30 → 2587.32] that
[2587.32 → 2587.54] he
[2587.54 → 2587.70] will
[2587.70 → 2587.90] be
[2587.90 → 2588.18] born
[2588.18 → 2588.40] just
[2588.40 → 2588.56] like
[2588.56 → 2588.84] every
[2588.84 → 2589.10] other
[2589.10 → 2589.56] child
[2589.56 → 2590.44] that
[2590.44 → 2590.58] he
[2590.58 → 2590.74] will
[2590.74 → 2590.96] be
[2590.96 → 2591.64] nursed
[2591.64 → 2592.40] he
[2592.40 → 2592.58] will
[2592.58 → 2592.84] have
[2592.84 → 2593.06] his
[2593.06 → 2593.36] diaper
[2593.36 → 2594.00] changed
[2594.00 → 2594.88] Mary
[2594.88 → 2595.30] will
[2595.30 → 2596.04] wipe
[2596.04 → 2596.32] his
[2596.32 → 2596.82] nose
[2596.82 → 2597.08] and
[2597.08 → 2597.32] have
[2597.32 → 2597.48] to
[2597.48 → 2597.64] give
[2597.64 → 2597.76] him
[2597.76 → 2597.90] a
[2597.90 → 2598.20] bath
[2598.20 → 2599.36] then
[2599.36 → 2599.52] he
[2599.52 → 2599.68] will
[2599.68 → 2600.00] grow
[2600.00 → 2600.22] up
[2600.22 → 2600.38] like
[2600.38 → 2600.72] any
[2600.72 → 2601.06] other
[2601.06 → 2601.52] child
[2601.52 → 2602.22] he
[2602.22 → 2602.72] will
[2602.72 → 2604.26] fall
[2604.26 → 2604.46] and
[2604.46 → 2604.72] scrape
[2604.72 → 2604.96] his
[2604.96 → 2605.20] knee
[2605.22 → 2606.36] people
[2606.36 → 2606.62] will
[2606.62 → 2606.82] say
[2606.82 → 2607.02] to
[2607.02 → 2607.32] Mary
[2607.32 → 2608.00] he
[2608.00 → 2608.26] looks
[2608.26 → 2608.54] just
[2608.54 → 2608.78] like
[2608.78 → 2609.00] you
[2609.00 → 2610.38] Jesus
[2610.38 → 2610.88] is
[2610.88 → 2611.24] a
[2611.24 → 2611.78] full
[2611.78 → 2612.16] human
[2612.16 → 2612.60] person
[2612.60 → 2614.18] but
[2614.18 → 2614.34] at
[2614.34 → 2614.50] the
[2614.50 → 2614.74] same
[2614.74 → 2615.18] time
[2615.18 → 2615.48] he
[2615.48 → 2615.68] is
[2615.68 → 2616.12] fully
[2616.12 → 2616.62] God
[2616.62 → 2617.34] and
[2617.34 → 2617.50] this
[2617.50 → 2617.66] is
[2617.66 → 2617.94] also
[2617.94 → 2618.18] what
[2618.18 → 2618.32] we
[2618.32 → 2618.74] believe
[2618.74 → 2619.44] so
[2619.44 → 2619.66] when
[2619.66 → 2619.78] we
[2619.78 → 2619.94] look
[2619.94 → 2620.08] at
[2620.08 → 2620.32] Jesus
[2620.32 → 2620.56] his
[2620.56 → 2620.86] life
[2620.86 → 2621.14] he
[2621.14 → 2621.66] he
[2621.66 → 2621.88] will
[2621.88 → 2622.78] forgive
[2622.78 → 2623.38] sins
[2623.38 → 2624.56] he
[2624.56 → 2624.92] will
[2624.92 → 2625.52] exercise
[2625.52 → 2625.92] his
[2625.92 → 2626.34] power
[2626.34 → 2626.70] over
[2626.70 → 2626.90] the
[2626.90 → 2627.24] wind
[2627.24 → 2627.48] and
[2627.48 → 2627.64] the
[2627.64 → 2628.14] waves
[2628.14 → 2628.92] you
[2628.92 → 2629.00] know
[2629.00 → 2629.18] he
[2629.18 → 2629.54] will
[2629.54 → 2630.08] turn
[2630.08 → 2630.46] water
[2630.46 → 2630.72] to
[2630.72 → 2631.10] wine
[2631.10 → 2631.28] he
[2631.28 → 2631.44] will
[2631.44 → 2631.86] take
[2631.86 → 2632.36] a
[2632.36 → 2632.82] basket
[2632.82 → 2633.32] of
[2633.32 → 2633.74] fish
[2633.74 → 2634.20] and bread
[2634.20 → 2634.38] and
[2634.38 → 2634.98] multiply
[2634.98 → 2635.28] it
[2635.28 → 2635.42] to
[2635.42 → 2635.70] feed
[2635.70 → 2636.28] thousands
[2636.28 → 2636.52] of
[2636.52 → 2636.80] people
[2636.80 → 2638.04] he
[2638.04 → 2638.18] will
[2638.18 → 2638.58] cast
[2638.58 → 2638.78] out
[2638.78 → 2639.14] demons
[2639.14 → 2639.58] he
[2639.58 → 2639.72] will
[2639.72 → 2639.96] heal
[2639.96 → 2640.18] the
[2640.18 → 2640.40] sick
[2640.40 → 2640.54] he
[2640.54 → 2640.68] will
[2640.68 → 2640.96] raise
[2640.96 → 2641.24] people
[2641.24 → 2641.44] from
[2641.44 → 2641.58] the
[2641.58 → 2641.82] dead
[2641.82 → 2643.32] so
[2643.32 → 2643.70] Jesus
[2643.70 → 2644.20] will
[2644.20 → 2645.52] mysteriously
[2645.52 → 2646.34] have
[2646.34 → 2646.96] two
[2646.96 → 2647.62] natures
[2647.62 → 2648.84] human
[2648.84 → 2650.02] and
[2650.02 → 2650.56] divine
[2650.56 → 2651.34] in
[2651.34 → 2652.22] one
[2652.22 → 2652.78] person
[2652.78 → 2654.38] this
[2654.38 → 2654.54] is
[2654.54 → 2654.78] what
[2654.78 → 2655.24] the
[2655.24 → 2655.52] Bible
[2655.52 → 2655.96] teaches
[2655.96 → 2656.40] us
[2656.40 → 2656.98] and
[2656.98 → 2657.32] no
[2657.32 → 2657.64] other
[2657.64 → 2658.06] person
[2658.06 → 2658.34] in
[2658.34 → 2658.76] all
[2658.76 → 2658.98] of
[2658.98 → 2659.24] human
[2659.24 → 2659.54] history
[2659.54 → 2659.90] or
[2659.90 → 2660.22] human
[2660.22 → 2660.80] imagination
[2660.80 → 2661.52] could
[2661.52 → 2661.66] have
[2661.66 → 2662.08] ever
[2662.08 → 2662.66] expected
[2662.66 → 2662.94] this
[2662.94 → 2663.16] to
[2663.16 → 2663.80] happen
[2663.80 → 2664.26] it
[2664.26 → 2664.38] was
[2664.38 → 2664.80] completely
[2664.80 → 2665.40] unexpected
[2665.40 → 2666.78] so
[2666.78 → 2666.96] there
[2666.96 → 2667.12] were
[2667.12 → 2667.66] promises
[2667.66 → 2668.10] throughout
[2668.10 → 2668.36] the
[2668.36 → 2668.54] Old
[2668.54 → 2668.98] Testament
[2668.98 → 2670.26] that
[2670.26 → 2670.58] the
[2670.58 → 2671.02] Saviour
[2671.02 → 2671.30] would
[2671.30 → 2671.70] come
[2671.70 → 2672.84] and
[2672.84 → 2673.02] would
[2673.02 → 2673.30] save
[2673.30 → 2673.62] God's
[2673.62 → 2673.92] people
[2673.92 → 2674.40] but
[2674.40 → 2674.54] there
[2674.54 → 2674.68] was
[2674.68 → 2674.92] no
[2674.92 → 2675.54] expectation
[2675.54 → 2675.78] that
[2675.78 → 2675.92] the
[2675.92 → 2676.42] Messiah
[2676.42 → 2676.98] would
[2676.98 → 2677.18] be
[2677.18 → 2677.54] God
[2677.54 → 2678.12] himself
[2678.12 → 2679.48] it
[2679.48 → 2679.64] would
[2679.64 → 2679.84] be
[2679.84 → 2680.28] God
[2680.28 → 2680.50] who
[2680.50 → 2680.68] would
[2680.68 → 2681.36] himself
[2681.36 → 2682.26] come
[2682.26 → 2682.62] down
[2682.62 → 2682.88] to
[2682.88 → 2683.22] earth
[2683.22 → 2683.90] wrap
[2683.90 → 2684.36] himself
[2684.36 → 2684.98] in
[2684.98 → 2685.14] the
[2685.14 → 2685.68] humility
[2685.68 → 2686.10] of
[2686.10 → 2686.66] human
[2686.66 → 2687.28] frailty
[2687.28 → 2689.68] this
[2689.68 → 2689.86] was
[2689.86 → 2690.58] unexpected
[2690.58 → 2691.02] this
[2691.02 → 2691.18] was
[2691.18 → 2691.70] God's
[2691.70 → 2692.16] plan

[2729.60 → 2730.00] change
[2730.00 → 2730.74] clothes
[2730.74 → 2731.30] so
[2731.30 → 2731.48] that

[2763.30 → 2763.62] Jesus
[2763.62 → 2764.10] came
[2764.10 → 2764.44] into
[2764.44 → 2764.68] the

[2769.64 → 2770.00] he
[2770.00 → 2770.42] humbled
[2770.42 → 2771.00] himself
[2771.00 → 2771.38] taking
[2771.38 → 2771.64] the
[2771.64 → 2771.94] form
[2771.94 → 2772.28] of a
[2772.28 → 2772.60] servant
[2772.60 → 2772.84] as
[2772.84 → 2773.04] Paul
[2773.04 → 2773.32] writes
[2773.32 → 2773.48] in
[2773.48 → 2774.00] Philippians
[2774.00 → 2775.62] to take

[2782.68 → 2783.04] ourselves
[2783.04 → 2783.48] to God
[2783.48 → 2784.04] nothing in
[2784.04 → 2784.52] our hands
[2784.52 → 2785.08] to bring

[2787.62 → 2788.24] us
[2788.24 → 2788.50] in
[2788.50 → 2788.86] Jesus'
[2789.18 → 2789.72] righteousness
[2789.72 → 2791.18] so that
[2791.18 → 2791.98] we now
[2791.98 → 2793.04] have the
[2793.04 → 2793.38] king's
[2793.38 → 2793.60] favour
[2793.60 → 2793.94] we are
[2793.94 → 2794.30] treated
[2794.30 → 2795.02] like
[2795.02 → 2795.42] princes
[2795.42 → 2797.76] that's
[2797.76 → 2797.88] what
[2797.88 → 2798.30] we sing
[2798.30 → 2798.44] in
[2798.44 → 2798.58] the
[2798.58 → 2798.96] hymn
[2798.96 → 2799.60] dressed
[2799.60 → 2799.90] in
[2799.90 → 2800.12] his
[2800.12 → 2800.56] righteousness
[2800.56 → 2801.08] alone
[2801.08 → 2801.62] faultless
[2801.62 → 2802.04] to stand
[2802.04 → 2802.34] before
[2802.34 → 2802.54] the
[2802.54 → 2802.80] throne
[2802.80 → 2804.66] that's
[2804.66 → 2804.96] what
[2804.96 → 2806.08] Jesus'
[2806.36 → 2806.64] coming
[2806.64 → 2807.04] means
[2807.04 → 2807.22] for
[2807.22 → 2807.60] us
[2807.60 → 2808.44] that
[2808.44 → 2808.70] he
[2808.70 → 2808.90] would
[2808.90 → 2809.12] come
[2809.12 → 2809.24] in
[2809.24 → 2809.68] humility
[2809.68 → 2810.38] so that
[2810.38 → 2810.56] we
[2810.56 → 2810.72] would
[2810.72 → 2810.88] be
[2810.88 → 2811.16] dressed
[2811.16 → 2811.36] in
[2811.36 → 2811.88] his
[2811.88 → 2812.62] righteousness
[2812.62 → 2813.74] right
[2813.74 → 2813.94] this
[2813.94 → 2814.10] is
[2814.10 → 2814.38] God's
[2814.38 → 2814.78] amazing
[2814.78 → 2815.08] plan
[2815.08 → 2815.22] of
[2815.22 → 2815.58] grace
[2815.58 → 2816.34] and
[2816.34 → 2816.48] it's
[2816.48 → 2816.68] something
[2816.68 → 2816.90] that
[2816.90 → 2817.24] far
[2817.24 → 2818.04] exceeds
[2818.04 → 2819.02] anything
[2819.02 → 2819.24] that
[2819.24 → 2819.38] we
[2819.38 → 2819.60] could
[2819.60 → 2819.78] have
[2819.78 → 2820.16] ever
[2820.16 → 2820.74] imagined
[2820.74 → 2821.74] right
[2821.74 → 2821.90] and
[2821.90 → 2822.12] God
[2822.12 → 2822.48] showing
[2822.48 → 2822.72] up
[2822.72 → 2822.88] in
[2822.88 → 2823.04] the
[2823.04 → 2823.30] womb
[2823.30 → 2823.48] of
[2823.48 → 2823.66] a
[2823.66 → 2823.98] virgin
[2823.98 → 2825.44] certainly
[2825.44 → 2825.82] meets
[2825.82 → 2826.00] that
[2826.00 → 2826.52] criteria
[2826.52 → 2827.28] nothing
[2827.28 → 2828.00] like
[2828.00 → 2828.34] this
[2828.34 → 2828.74] was
[2828.74 → 2829.18] planned
[2829.18 → 2830.60] but
[2830.60 → 2830.90] friends
[2830.90 → 2831.24] this
[2831.24 → 2831.80] is
[2831.80 → 2832.74] not
[2832.74 → 2833.16] only
[2833.16 → 2833.58] that

[2836.44 → 2836.64] don't
[2836.64 → 2836.92] deserve
[2836.92 → 2837.02] it
[2837.02 → 2837.12] but
[2837.12 → 2837.22] it
[2837.22 → 2837.46] comes

[2847.98 → 2848.36] takes
[2848.36 → 2848.72] us
[2848.72 → 2849.40] and
[2849.40 → 2849.64] it
[2849.64 → 2850.64] invites
[2850.64 → 2850.88] us
[2850.88 → 2851.22] into

[2900.28 → 2900.54] a
[2900.54 → 2901.10] disciple
[2901.10 → 2901.98] like
[2901.98 → 2902.38] us
[2902.38 → 2903.28] is
[2903.28 → 2903.74] worthy
[2903.74 → 2904.20] of
[2904.20 → 2904.64] our
[2904.64 → 2905.50] admiration
[2905.50 → 2906.72] because
[2906.72 → 2907.02] Mary
[2907.02 → 2907.36] could
[2907.36 → 2907.56] have
[2907.56 → 2907.98] said
[2907.98 → 2909.20] Gabriel
[2909.20 → 2910.78] thanks
[2910.78 → 2911.58] but
[2911.58 → 2912.54] no
[2912.54 → 2912.94] thanks
[2912.94 → 2913.68] right
[2913.68 → 2914.30] count
[2914.30 → 2914.48] me
[2914.48 → 2914.76] out
[2914.76 → 2915.00] of
[2915.00 → 2915.18] this
[2915.18 → 2915.50] crazy
[2915.50 → 2915.90] plan
[2915.90 → 2916.36] this
[2916.36 → 2916.76] sounds
[2916.76 → 2917.92] absolutely
[2917.92 → 2918.26] like
[2918.26 → 2918.50] something
[2918.50 → 2918.72] I
[2918.72 → 2918.90] do
[2918.90 → 2919.14] not
[2919.14 → 2919.26] want
[2919.26 → 2919.34] to
[2919.34 → 2919.58] be
[2919.58 → 2920.02] involved
[2920.02 → 2920.26] in
[2920.26 → 2921.54] but
[2921.54 → 2921.84] not
[2921.84 → 2922.22] Mary
[2922.22 → 2923.12] right
[2923.12 → 2923.56] she
[2923.56 → 2924.24] is
[2924.24 → 2924.84] completely
[2924.84 → 2925.26] caught
[2925.26 → 2925.60] up
[2925.60 → 2926.12] in
[2926.12 → 2926.30] the
[2926.30 → 2926.74] grace
[2926.74 → 2926.92] of
[2926.92 → 2927.18] God's
[2927.18 → 2927.46] plan
[2927.46 → 2927.64] in
[2927.64 → 2927.82] the
[2927.82 → 2928.22] wonder
[2928.22 → 2928.78] of
[2928.78 → 2928.94] being
[2928.94 → 2929.34] invited
[2929.34 → 2929.60] into
[2929.60 → 2929.94] something
[2929.94 → 2930.18] that
[2930.18 → 2930.34] is
[2930.34 → 2930.84] far
[2930.84 → 2931.26] bigger
[2931.26 → 2932.06] than
[2932.06 → 2932.66] herself
[2932.66 → 2934.90] even
[2934.90 → 2935.24] at
[2935.24 → 2935.38] a
[2935.38 → 2935.72] personal
[2935.72 → 2936.30] cost
[2936.30 → 2936.88] right
[2936.88 → 2937.12] because
[2937.12 → 2937.42] the
[2937.42 → 2937.76] cost
[2937.76 → 2937.90] of
[2937.90 → 2938.20] entering
[2938.20 → 2938.46] into
[2938.46 → 2938.76] God's
[2938.76 → 2939.08] grace
[2939.08 → 2939.34] of
[2939.34 → 2940.16] really
[2940.16 → 2940.96] surrendering
[2940.96 → 2941.40] her
[2941.40 → 2941.84] life
[2941.84 → 2942.02] to
[2942.02 → 2942.20] what
[2942.20 → 2942.60] God
[2942.60 → 2943.06] would
[2943.06 → 2943.86] do
[2943.86 → 2944.26] in
[2944.26 → 2944.50] and
[2944.50 → 2944.68] through
[2944.68 → 2945.04] her
[2945.04 → 2946.06] of
[2946.06 → 2946.26] course
[2946.26 → 2946.44] it's
[2946.44 → 2947.24] nothing
[2947.24 → 2947.64] compared
[2947.64 → 2947.80] to
[2947.80 → 2947.90] what
[2947.90 → 2948.04] is
[2948.04 → 2948.50] gained
[2948.50 → 2948.70] but
[2948.70 → 2948.80] at
[2948.80 → 2948.90] the
[2948.90 → 2949.10] same
[2949.10 → 2949.46] time
[2949.46 → 2949.62] there
[2949.62 → 2949.76] is
[2949.76 → 2949.92] a
[2949.92 → 2950.22] huge
[2950.22 → 2950.82] surrender
[2950.82 → 2951.90] on
[2951.90 → 2952.10] her
[2952.10 → 2952.52] part
[2952.52 → 2953.72] right
[2953.72 → 2953.94] so
[2953.94 → 2954.18] she
[2954.18 → 2954.46] has
[2954.46 → 2954.64] to
[2954.64 → 2955.08] surrender
[2955.08 → 2955.36] her
[2955.36 → 2955.96] reputation
[2955.96 → 2956.78] Mary
[2956.78 → 2956.96] is
[2956.96 → 2957.12] going
[2957.12 → 2957.24] to
[2957.24 → 2957.38] have
[2957.38 → 2957.54] to
[2957.54 → 2957.78] deal
[2957.78 → 2957.96] with
[2957.96 → 2958.10] the
[2958.10 → 2958.78] offence
[2958.78 → 2959.28] that
[2959.28 → 2959.40] would
[2959.40 → 2959.64] come
[2959.64 → 2959.82] to
[2959.82 → 2960.20] her
[2960.20 → 2960.60] to
[2964.90 → 2965.80] her
[2965.80 → 2966.02] and
[2966.02 → 2966.24] Joseph
[2966.24 → 2966.46] are
[2966.46 → 2966.76] married
[2966.76 → 2968.34] she
[2968.34 → 2968.48] will
[2968.48 → 2968.68] have
[2968.68 → 2968.86] to
[2968.86 → 2969.24] carry
[2969.24 → 2969.82] the
[2969.82 → 2970.52] responsibility
[2970.52 → 2971.34] of
[2971.34 → 2971.54] being
[2971.54 → 2971.74] the
[2971.74 → 2972.00] mother
[2972.00 → 2972.30] to
[2972.30 → 2972.54] the
[2972.54 → 2972.98] Messiah
[2972.98 → 2974.94] Mary
[2974.94 → 2975.18] will
[2975.18 → 2975.42] have
[2975.42 → 2975.60] to
[2975.60 → 2976.02] surrender
[2976.02 → 2976.94] control
[2976.94 → 2977.56] of
[2977.56 → 2978.38] this
[2978.38 → 2978.88] child
[2978.88 → 2979.14] that
[2979.14 → 2979.30] will
[2979.30 → 2979.52] be
[2979.52 → 2979.86] hers
[2979.86 → 2980.24] because
[2980.24 → 2980.52] it's

[3020.38 → 3020.70] grace
[3020.70 → 3020.86] and
[3020.86 → 3021.00] you're

[3068.20 → 3068.42] to
[3068.42 → 3068.70] God
[3068.70 → 3068.92] in
[3068.92 → 3069.26] your
[3069.26 → 3069.72] family
[3069.72 → 3070.26] in
[3070.26 → 3070.54] your
[3070.54 → 3071.60] work
[3071.60 → 3072.12] with
[3072.12 → 3072.26] your

[3072.48 → 3072.66] of

[3073.90 → 3074.50] your

[3075.00 → 3075.20] every
[3075.20 → 3075.44] way
[3075.44 → 3077.70] so
[3077.70 → 3077.86] what
[3077.86 → 3078.00] we
[3078.00 → 3078.20] do
[3078.20 → 3078.58] is
[3078.58 → 3079.76] to
[3079.76 → 3080.04] become
[3080.04 → 3080.22] a

[3080.52 → 3080.74] you
[3080.74 → 3081.02] see
[3081.02 → 3081.58] God
[3081.58 → 3082.54] waving
[3082.54 → 3082.92] his
[3082.92 → 3083.34] big
[3083.34 → 3084.04] windmill
[3084.04 → 3084.54] arms
[3084.54 → 3084.84] to
[3084.84 → 3085.08] you
[3085.08 → 3086.16] and
[3086.16 → 3086.42] you're
[3086.42 → 3086.86] standing
[3086.86 → 3087.30] there
[3087.30 → 3088.36] on
[3088.36 → 3088.54] the
[3088.54 → 3088.88] edge
[3088.88 → 3089.18] looking
[3089.18 → 3089.40] to
[3089.40 → 3089.80] God
[3089.80 → 3090.24] and
[3090.24 → 3090.44] he
[3090.44 → 3090.96] invites
[3090.96 → 3091.32] you
[3091.32 → 3091.98] into
[3091.98 → 3092.32] his
[3092.32 → 3092.76] story
[3092.76 → 3093.32] and
[3093.32 → 3093.50] you
[3093.50 → 3094.18] respond
[3094.18 → 3094.60] by
[3094.60 → 3095.38] running
[3095.38 → 3095.68] to
[3095.68 → 3096.06] him
[3096.06 → 3096.92] where
[3096.92 → 3097.10] you
[3097.10 → 3097.28] are
[3097.28 → 3097.76] swept
[3097.76 → 3098.02] up
[3098.02 → 3098.20] into
[3098.20 → 3098.62] God's
[3098.62 → 3099.00] story
[3099.00 → 3099.96] and
[3099.96 → 3100.22] like
[3100.22 → 3100.54] Eugene
[3100.54 → 3100.92] Peterson
[3100.92 → 3101.46] says
[3101.46 → 3101.70] your
[3101.70 → 3102.46] smallness
[3102.46 → 3103.30] absorbed
[3103.30 → 3104.12] into
[3104.12 → 3104.48] his
[3104.48 → 3105.16] largeness
[3105.16 → 3106.24] right
[3106.24 → 3106.54] and
[3106.54 → 3106.76] friends
[3106.76 → 3107.16] that's
[3107.16 → 3107.50] how
[3107.50 → 3108.16] God's
[3108.16 → 3108.86] grace
[3108.86 → 3110.38] comes
[3110.38 → 3110.60] into
[3110.60 → 3110.76] our
[3110.76 → 3111.02] lives
[3111.02 → 3111.12] and
[3111.12 → 3111.28] that's
[3111.28 → 3111.42] how
[3111.42 → 3111.64] he
[3111.64 → 3112.06] fulfills
[3112.06 → 3112.22] our
[3112.22 → 3112.52] longing
[3112.52 → 3112.74] for
[3112.74 → 3113.14] grace
[3113.14 → 3114.64] he
[3114.64 → 3115.14] invites
[3115.14 → 3115.46] you
[3115.46 → 3115.70] to
[3115.70 → 3116.36] receive
[3116.36 → 3117.04] his
[3117.04 → 3117.34] grace
[3117.34 → 3117.68] today
[3117.68 → 3118.68] so
[3118.68 → 3118.82] let
[3118.82 → 3118.92] me
[3118.92 → 3119.10] pray
[3119.10 → 3119.32] for
[3119.32 → 3119.58] us
[3119.58 → 3120.14] that
[3120.14 → 3120.32] we
[3120.32 → 3120.50] would
[3120.50 → 3120.64] do
[3120.64 → 3120.90] that
[3120.90 → 3126.54] our
[3126.54 → 3126.86] heavenly
[3126.86 → 3127.32] father
[3127.32 → 3127.72] your
[3127.72 → 3128.10] grace
[3128.10 → 3128.60] is
[3128.60 → 3130.18] amazing
[3130.18 → 3132.34] we
[3132.34 → 3132.68] are
[3132.68 → 3133.50] undeserving
[3133.50 → 3134.10] of it
[3134.10 → 3134.62] it is
[3134.62 → 3135.16] free
[3135.16 → 3136.46] and
[3136.46 → 3136.60] lord
[3136.60 → 3136.80] it
[3136.80 → 3137.36] flows
[3137.36 → 3137.88] from
[3137.88 → 3138.14] you
[3138.14 → 3139.62] and
[3139.62 → 3139.74] lord
[3139.74 → 3139.94] as
[3139.94 → 3140.06] it
[3140.06 → 3140.32] comes
[3140.32 → 3140.54] into
[3140.54 → 3140.74] our
[3140.74 → 3141.04] lives
[3141.04 → 3141.24] we
[3141.24 → 3141.52] pray
[3141.52 → 3141.80] that
[3141.80 → 3141.96] you
[3141.96 → 3142.12] would
[3142.12 → 3142.42] help
[3142.42 → 3142.80] us
[3142.80 → 3144.14] to
[3144.14 → 3144.44] be
[3144.44 → 3144.92] satisfied
[3144.92 → 3145.40] alone
[3145.40 → 3145.62] by
[3145.62 → 3145.92] this
[3145.92 → 3146.24] grace
[3146.24 → 3146.44] to
[3146.44 → 3146.78] not
[3146.78 → 3147.80] look
[3147.80 → 3148.56] to
[3148.56 → 3149.06] other
[3149.06 → 3149.76] things
[3149.76 → 3150.18] to
[3150.18 → 3151.06] fulfill
[3151.06 → 3151.52] this
[3151.52 → 3151.92] longing
[3151.92 → 3152.18] that
[3152.18 → 3152.32] we
[3152.32 → 3152.82] have
[3152.82 → 3154.38] but
[3154.38 → 3154.58] that
[3154.58 → 3154.86] lord
[3154.86 → 3155.06] your
[3155.06 → 3155.40] grace
[3155.40 → 3155.70] as it
[3155.70 → 3155.96] comes
[3155.96 → 3156.16] to
[3156.16 → 3156.36] us
[3156.36 → 3156.58] would
[3156.58 → 3157.36] fill
[3157.36 → 3157.94] our
[3157.94 → 3158.50] desires
[3158.50 → 3159.70] and
[3159.70 → 3159.82] that
[3159.82 → 3159.96] in
[3159.96 → 3160.52] response
[3160.52 → 3160.80] to
[3160.80 → 3160.98] it
[3160.98 → 3161.12] lord
[3161.12 → 3161.30] that
[3161.30 → 3161.42] you
[3161.42 → 3161.56] would
[3161.56 → 3161.86] help
[3161.86 → 3162.22] us
[3162.22 → 3162.88] to
[3162.88 → 3163.04] be
[3163.04 → 3163.40] caught
[3163.40 → 3163.76] up
[3163.76 → 3163.96] in
[3163.96 → 3164.24] this
[3164.24 → 3164.90] story
[3164.90 → 3165.78] this
[3165.78 → 3166.50] reality
[3166.50 → 3166.96] that
[3166.96 → 3167.60] encompasses
[3167.60 → 3167.88] the
[3167.88 → 3168.26] entire
[3168.26 → 3168.64] world
[3168.64 → 3168.80] and
[3168.80 → 3169.08] all
[3169.08 → 3169.22] of
[3169.22 → 3169.60] history
[3169.60 → 3170.64] and
[3170.64 → 3170.78] that
[3170.78 → 3170.92] we
[3170.92 → 3171.08] would
[3171.08 → 3171.38] find
[3171.38 → 3171.56] our
[3171.56 → 3171.90] lives
[3171.90 → 3172.06] in
[3172.06 → 3172.28] you
[3172.28 → 3173.34] lord
[3173.34 → 3173.62] help
[3173.62 → 3173.86] us
[3173.86 → 3174.04] by
[3174.04 → 3174.20] your
[3174.20 → 3174.52] spirit
[3174.52 → 3174.96] we pray
[3174.96 → 3175.14] in
[3175.14 → 3175.36] Jesus
[3175.36 → 3175.70] name
[3175.70 → 3176.88] amen
[3176.88 → 3178.08] and
[3178.08 → 3178.34] so
[3178.34 → 3178.90] we
[3178.90 → 3179.02] will
[3179.02 → 3179.26] now
[3179.26 → 3179.64] sing
[3179.64 → 3180.10] our
[3180.10 → 3180.44] song
[3180.44 → 3180.56] of
[3180.56 → 3181.10] response
[3181.10 → 3183.16] and
[3183.16 → 3183.26] so
[3183.26 → 3183.40] let's
[3183.40 → 3183.50] do
[3183.50 → 3183.72] that
[3205.14 → 3210.38] craft
[3210.38 → 3212.96] holiness
[3212.96 → 3213.44] Japan
[3227.44 → 3227.76] of
[3227.76 → 3228.54] n
[3228.54 → 3233.54] strength and consolation
[3233.54 → 3238.58] Hope of all the earth
[3238.58 → 3240.30] Thou art
[3240.30 → 3243.18] Dear desire
[3243.18 → 3247.48] Of every nation
[3247.48 → 3254.60] Joy of every longing heart
[3254.60 → 3263.28] Born by people to deliver
[3263.28 → 3270.14] Born a child and yet a king
[3270.14 → 3277.04] Born to reign in us forever
[3277.04 → 3283.60] As our gracious kingdom bring
[3283.60 → 3290.60] By Thine own eternal spirit
[3291.12 → 3297.42] Rule in all our hearts alone
[3297.42 → 3304.88] By Thine own sufficient merit
[3304.88 → 3311.88] Raise us to Thy glorious throne
[3311.88 → 3335.56] Before we spend some time in prayer, there are a few notes that did not make into our latest Connections newsletter. I just wanted to point out.
[3335.56 → 3347.18] First, Elizabeth Vendean is a former member of our church and passed away on November 27th at the age of 94 after struggling with dementia for the last 10 years.
[3347.18 → 3358.96] Quite a few people in our church would have known Elizabeth from when they were here, but if not, you may know she was John Vendean's mom and Melissa Vendean's grandmother.
[3358.96 → 3363.30] So we definitely want to remember the Vendean family in this difficult time.
[3363.30 → 3376.42] Last week we prayed for my father, John Iron, which of course we were very grateful for, but there's been another change where the operation date has been delayed now to the 18th.
[3376.42 → 3383.42] And they will now first try another, which would be the third angiogram to seal that problem artery.
[3383.42 → 3388.42] And at that point if it's unsuccessful, they will then have to operate for a second time.
[3388.42 → 3391.30] So obviously we're praying that that angiogram is successful.
[3391.30 → 3395.68] So let's spend some time in prayer together.
[3398.10 → 3402.90] Father, you are great and glorious and eternal.
[3403.54 → 3407.64] It's good to spend time worshipping you both with song and word.
[3408.28 → 3413.44] And even though they're spread out physically, we know that you are among us, and we praise and thank you for that.
[3414.22 → 3417.84] We thank you also for the message from Pastor Jason this morning.
[3417.84 → 3425.90] We do long for your grace and your return and pray that we keep that forefront in our minds this season and always.
[3427.68 → 3432.34] We give thanks to you for the arrival of the Shafter family.
[3433.14 → 3444.76] Please be near Valid, Benz, and Bradman as they go through the required 14 days of quarantine and all the adjustments to life in their new, not-so-normal country.
[3444.76 → 3456.64] We thank you for the successful double tumour removal that Julie Belly underwent and pray that she can make a full recovery from that delicate operation.
[3457.78 → 3461.56] And we also thank you for the favourable prognosis for Jean Lyman.
[3461.70 → 3469.08] And we thank you also that Get Vandermulen can look forward to moving back to Elam after six weeks in hospital with a broken hip.
[3469.08 → 3476.08] And I'd like all to also bring my father John before you as he prepares for a third angiogram.
[3476.40 → 3480.14] And we just pray that these measures are successful in correcting the bleeding.
[3480.28 → 3485.74] And we just pray for your presence to be with him and my mother as they wait.
[3487.10 → 3493.16] Please be near Tim and Noreen Van tall as Tim continues to experience poor health and difficult days.
[3493.16 → 3497.82] We pray for healing for Tim and strength and grace for those supporting him.
[3499.00 → 3501.06] Pray also for Kim, Kim Kulun.
[3501.76 → 3507.30] Pray stay near her and George as they deal with this occurrence of cancer that Kim's struggling with.
[3508.32 → 3511.74] And please be near those that are nearing the end of their time with us.
[3511.84 → 3516.06] We think in particular of Kathy Scott and Henry Younger both in hospice.
[3516.18 → 3519.42] And we pray for comfort for them and those caring for them.
[3519.42 → 3525.04] And we hold up for you that Vander men family as they grieve the loss of Elizabeth.
[3525.72 → 3531.80] May they find meaningful ways to celebrate Elizabeth's time with us amidst all the restrictions on gathering together.
[3533.30 → 3538.68] We also pray for patience and strength in the ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.
[3539.30 → 3543.46] We've seen the challenges that the change in seasons and wartime indoors have brought.
[3544.04 → 3547.30] And the immediate future seems to offer more restrictions, lockdowns,
[3547.30 → 3550.60] and the loss of gatherings that are so much a part of this Advent season.
[3551.44 → 3557.20] Help us to continue to think of others and focus on being part of this bigger scheme of things,
[3557.30 → 3562.82] relatively short-term solutions that are needed before the vaccine becomes available to those that need it most.
[3562.82 → 3572.28] And maybe somewhat lost in all the focus on COVID is the plight of the estimated 70 million people around the world
[3572.28 → 3575.46] who have been forced to flee their homes for one reason or another.
[3576.20 → 3580.04] Just maybe unable to fear or fearing a return to their home countries
[3580.04 → 3583.38] and unable to move forward as they are confined to refugee camps.
[3583.88 → 3589.10] Many of these people face a bleak future and that only international help can help alleviate.
[3589.10 → 3594.22] We pray as nations and individuals that we can be part of solutions
[3594.22 → 3598.50] and the great work our new immigrant community does is part of that.
[3599.28 → 3602.68] Pray that you give us the grace and strength to continue that work.
[3604.58 → 3606.80] Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.
[3607.84 → 3609.78] Help us to be effective servants to you
[3609.78 → 3614.26] and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
[3615.38 → 3617.10] We thank you for hearing our prayers.
[3617.82 → 3618.02] Amen.
[3618.02 → 3618.12] Amen.
[3619.10 → 3619.58] Amen.
[3631.58 → 3637.62] So friends, we go out into our week with our Father's blessing upon us.
[3637.78 → 3642.86] So I invite you to hold out your hands and receive this blessing from God.
[3643.92 → 3646.76] Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[3646.76 → 3652.30] and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy.
[3652.84 → 3656.28] To the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[3656.36 → 3658.84] be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[3658.84 → 3661.74] before all times and now and forevermore.
[3662.28 → 3662.58] Amen.
[3662.58 → 3662.68] Amen.
[3662.68 → 3683.14] To God, may the glory, great things he has done,
[3683.14 → 3687.60] the glory, great things He has done.
