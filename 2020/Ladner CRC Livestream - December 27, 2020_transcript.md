[491.10 --> 497.10]  We pray all of this in the name of the name of the name of the world.
[497.10 --> 499.10]  Amen.
[527.10 --> 557.10]  And heaven and heaven and nature,
[557.10 --> 562.88]  Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
[562.88 --> 569.26]  Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
[569.26 --> 575.60]  No more let sin and sorrows grow
[575.60 --> 580.74]  Nor thorns infest the ground
[580.74 --> 587.56]  He comes to make His blessings flow
[587.56 --> 590.66]  Far as the curse is found
[590.66 --> 593.66]  Far as the curse is found
[593.66 --> 600.30]  Far as, far as the curse is found
[600.30 --> 606.88]  He rules the world with truth and ways
[606.88 --> 612.08]  And makes the nations prove
[612.08 --> 618.30]  The glories of His righteousness
[618.30 --> 622.04]  And wonders of His love
[622.04 --> 625.02]  And wonders of His love
[625.02 --> 632.02]  And wonders, wonders of His love
[632.02 --> 642.94]  Go tell it on the mountain
[642.94 --> 647.34]  Over the hills and everywhere
[647.34 --> 651.70]  Go tell it on the mountain
[651.70 --> 656.30]  That Jesus Christ is born
[656.30 --> 660.62]  While shepherds can be watching
[660.62 --> 665.20]  Or silent flocks by night
[665.20 --> 669.70]  Behold, throughout the heavens
[669.70 --> 674.62]  There shone a holy light
[674.62 --> 681.14]  Go tell it on the mountain
[681.14 --> 685.46]  Over the hills and everywhere
[685.46 --> 689.60]  Go tell it on the mountain
[689.60 --> 694.04]  That Jesus Christ is born
[694.04 --> 698.64]  The shepherds feared and trembled
[698.64 --> 702.90]  When low above the earth
[702.90 --> 707.02]  Rang out the angels' chorus
[707.02 --> 711.92]  That hailed our Savior's birth
[711.92 --> 718.62]  Go tell it on the mountain
[718.62 --> 723.06]  Over the hills and everywhere
[723.06 --> 727.26]  Go tell it on the mountain
[727.26 --> 731.68]  That Jesus Christ is born
[731.68 --> 736.00]  Down in a lowly stable
[736.00 --> 740.70]  The humble Christ was born
[740.70 --> 744.80]  And God sent us salvation
[744.80 --> 750.28]  That blessed Christmas morn
[750.28 --> 756.72]  Go tell it on the mountain
[756.72 --> 761.04]  Over the hills and everywhere
[761.04 --> 763.04]  Tell it on the mountain
[763.04 --> 765.04]  Tell it on the mountain
[765.04 --> 770.10]  That Jesus Christ is born
[770.10 --> 782.68]  What do you want
[782.68 --> 787.38]  Who else commands all the hosts on щel
[787.38 --> 800.52]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[801.90 --> 806.94]  Who else can make every king bow down?
[808.22 --> 813.74]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[813.74 --> 819.64]  Only a holy God.
[822.08 --> 826.94]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[828.78 --> 833.16]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[834.54 --> 839.16]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[839.16 --> 845.58]  Only a holy God.
[845.58 --> 856.58]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[858.26 --> 865.58]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[865.58 --> 871.88]  Come and worship the holy God.
[871.88 --> 887.66]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[889.00 --> 894.22]  What other power can raise the dead?
[894.22 --> 900.56]  What other name remains undefeated?
[901.86 --> 906.40]  Only a holy God.
[906.40 --> 918.04]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[918.60 --> 926.40]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[926.40 --> 932.22]  Come and worship the holy God.
[932.22 --> 960.82]  Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[960.82 --> 967.66]  Who else would offer His only Son?
[967.66 --> 973.50]  Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[975.42 --> 979.96]  Only a holy God.
[979.96 --> 984.30]  Only my holy God.
[984.30 --> 1014.28]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1014.30 --> 1014.76]  Amen.
[1022.98 --> 1028.60]  So we'll continue our worship together this morning with a time of confession and assurance.
[1029.42 --> 1035.02]  This morning for our prayer of confession, we're going to use the Beatitudes from Matthew 5 to guide us.
[1035.90 --> 1044.70]  And again, I want to invite you to participate with me out loud by reading the words in bold that you will see on your screen.
[1045.60 --> 1050.02]  And so let's bow our hearts together in prayer in this time of confession.
[1050.02 --> 1058.80]  Blessed are the poor in spirit, but in our pride we exalt ourselves.
[1060.14 --> 1066.10]  Blessed are those who mourn, but we keep our distance from others in pain.
[1067.98 --> 1074.82]  Blessed are the meek and the peacemakers, but in our anger we lash out in revenge.
[1074.82 --> 1083.80]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, but in our sloth we despair of virtue.
[1085.58 --> 1092.38]  Blessed are the merciful, but in our greed we demand to possess and fail to give.
[1094.02 --> 1100.96]  Blessed are the pure in heart, but in our lust we sacrifice others to serve ourselves.
[1100.96 --> 1110.70]  Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, but we live in fear of the rejection of others.
[1111.74 --> 1115.56]  Heavenly Father, it is evident that we have loved darkness.
[1116.50 --> 1119.80]  Give us grace to walk again in the light.
[1121.48 --> 1127.48]  So brothers and sisters, I'll just give you a moment to come before the Lord in your own hearts
[1127.48 --> 1130.50]  and silently confess your own sins to him.
[1130.96 --> 1151.50]  God, we thank you that you hear our confessions and you meet us with your mercy.
[1152.92 --> 1157.18]  God, we cling to your promise that in Christ we have forgiveness of sins.
[1157.18 --> 1165.70]  God, we pray that you would give us the hope and the joy that comes from knowing your forgiveness and your love.
[1166.38 --> 1169.50]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1171.18 --> 1178.60]  Then brothers and sisters, receive these words of assurance and these words of grace that come to us from Galatians 4.
[1178.60 --> 1208.58]  It says,
[1208.60 --> 1217.62]  This is the grace that God has given us through the coming of Christ that we celebrate on this Christmas.
[1218.22 --> 1224.52]  And so let's sing a song of response in response to God's great love and grace to us.
[1224.52 --> 1231.90]  Be familiar to you.
[1231.90 --> 1232.52]  Be familiar to you.
[1232.52 --> 1248.52]  Are you hurt and broken within?
[1248.52 --> 1254.62]  Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
[1254.62 --> 1255.62]  Jesus is calling.
[1255.62 --> 1256.62]  Jesus is calling.
[1256.62 --> 1264.62]  Have you come to the end of yourself?
[1264.62 --> 1269.62]  Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[1269.62 --> 1272.62]  Jesus is calling.
[1272.62 --> 1281.62]  O come to the altar.
[1281.62 --> 1287.50]  The Father's arms are open wide.
[1287.50 --> 1299.24]  Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[1299.24 --> 1300.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1300.24 --> 1304.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1304.24 --> 1313.24]  Leave behind your regrets and mistakes.
[1313.24 --> 1314.24]  Come today.
[1314.24 --> 1317.24]  There's no reason to wait.
[1317.24 --> 1320.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1320.24 --> 1321.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1321.24 --> 1327.24]  Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy.
[1327.24 --> 1333.24]  From the ashes a new life was born.
[1333.24 --> 1337.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1337.24 --> 1338.24]  He is calling.
[1338.24 --> 1340.24]  Lord, you are.
[1340.24 --> 1341.24]  He mới is calling.
[1341.24 --> 1342.24]  Jesus is calling.
[1342.24 --> 1343.24]  Amen.
[1343.24 --> 1344.82]  the altar
[1344.82 --> 1347.90]  the Father's
[1347.90 --> 1349.96]  arms are open
[1349.96 --> 1350.74]  wide
[1350.74 --> 1352.20]  forgiveness
[1352.20 --> 1355.68]  was bought with
[1355.68 --> 1357.46]  the precious
[1357.46 --> 1359.18]  blood of
[1359.18 --> 1360.86]  Jesus Christ
[1360.86 --> 1375.18]  Oh what a
[1375.18 --> 1376.52]  Savior
[1376.52 --> 1379.60]  isn't
[1379.60 --> 1379.98]  He
[1379.98 --> 1382.52]  wonderful
[1382.52 --> 1384.06]  sing
[1384.06 --> 1386.14]  hallelujah
[1386.14 --> 1388.52]  Christ is
[1388.52 --> 1389.36]  risen
[1389.36 --> 1394.10]  bow down
[1394.10 --> 1394.70]  before
[1394.70 --> 1397.42]  Him
[1397.42 --> 1399.46]  for He is
[1399.46 --> 1401.90]  Lord of
[1401.90 --> 1402.52]  all
[1402.52 --> 1403.52]  sing
[1403.52 --> 1405.52]  hallelujah
[1405.52 --> 1407.88]  Christ is
[1407.88 --> 1409.02]  risen
[1409.02 --> 1415.58]  Oh come
[1415.58 --> 1416.36]  to
[1416.36 --> 1418.34]  the altar
[1418.34 --> 1421.50]  the Father's
[1421.50 --> 1422.68]  arms are
[1422.68 --> 1423.34]  open
[1423.34 --> 1424.36]  wide
[1424.36 --> 1425.84]  forgiveness
[1425.84 --> 1428.34]  was bought
[1428.34 --> 1429.40]  with
[1429.40 --> 1431.06]  the precious
[1431.06 --> 1432.76]  blood of
[1432.76 --> 1433.50]  Jesus
[1433.50 --> 1434.50]  Christ
[1434.50 --> 1444.28]  sung
[1444.28 --> 1445.98]  in un
[1445.98 --> 1446.52]  and
[1446.52 --> 1446.90]  hers
[1446.90 --> 1448.10]  is
[1448.10 --> 1449.08]  on
[1449.08 --> 1450.72]  Oh
[1450.72 --> 1452.78]  know
[1452.78 --> 1452.80]  himself
[1452.80 --> 1453.88]  has
[1453.88 --> 1454.22] uld
[1454.32 --> 1454.92]  His
[1454.92 --> 1455.72]  thanks
[1455.72 --> 1455.82]  to
[1455.94 --> 1456.10]  him
[1456.10 --> 1456.48]  and
[1456.48 --> 1457.96]  away
[1458.20 --> 1458.38]  and
[1459.12 --> 1459.60]  smile
[1459.60 --> 1468.90]  Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
[1468.90 --> 1474.68]  Tell the world of the treasure you found
[1474.68 --> 1492.52]  So again, greetings to all of you watching with us this morning.
[1492.92 --> 1498.32]  And today we are continuing our sermon series called The King of Our Longings.
[1498.32 --> 1504.80]  Because on this first Sunday of Christmas, we celebrate that Jesus has come.
[1505.38 --> 1512.30]  He has kept his promise that he would send the Messiah, that he would come to us as our long-awaited king.
[1513.04 --> 1515.88]  And friends, when Jesus does come to us as our king,
[1516.50 --> 1522.16]  he fulfills our deepest longings and desires that we have as men and women.
[1522.16 --> 1531.54]  And so we've seen in these first few chapters of Luke how Jesus fulfills our longings for things like joy,
[1532.08 --> 1537.24]  for grace, for mercy, for peace, and for comfort.
[1537.94 --> 1545.34]  And today we're in Luke chapter 3, and we'll be looking at our longing for salvation.
[1545.84 --> 1547.30]  Our longing for salvation.
[1548.30 --> 1550.98]  And so let us read our passage this morning.
[1550.98 --> 1554.12]  It is Luke chapter 3, verses 2 through 6.
[1554.70 --> 1558.56]  And we will have the scripture here on the screen.
[1558.98 --> 1561.38]  So please give your attention to this reading of God's word.
[1562.34 --> 1566.74]  During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas,
[1567.20 --> 1570.88]  the word of God came to John, son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.
[1571.74 --> 1574.82]  And he went into all the country around the Jordan,
[1575.40 --> 1579.22]  preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[1579.22 --> 1584.50]  As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
[1585.30 --> 1587.42]  a voice of one calling in the wilderness,
[1588.20 --> 1591.64]  prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
[1592.38 --> 1594.56]  Every valley shall be filled in,
[1595.16 --> 1597.20]  every mountain and hill made low.
[1597.88 --> 1599.92]  The crooked roads shall become straight,
[1600.42 --> 1602.28]  the rough ways smooth.
[1602.28 --> 1607.50]  And all people will see God's salvation.
[1609.30 --> 1612.88]  So friends, as we come to the scriptures this morning,
[1613.00 --> 1614.22]  let's begin with a word of prayer.
[1617.22 --> 1621.20]  Our Heavenly Father, just as John was in the wilderness,
[1621.92 --> 1627.56]  so we too, Lord, have been in quite a wilderness in 2020.
[1627.56 --> 1632.68]  But Lord, just as John foretold that the King is coming
[1632.68 --> 1634.84]  and we celebrate that he has now come.
[1635.70 --> 1638.58]  And so in the same way, Lord, would he come to us this morning?
[1639.20 --> 1641.38]  In our desires and our longings,
[1641.76 --> 1643.68]  would he come and meet us?
[1644.16 --> 1647.36]  Wherever we are, each one of us, in our own lives.
[1648.44 --> 1649.78]  And Lord, in meeting us,
[1650.54 --> 1653.76]  would you share with us your life,
[1653.76 --> 1656.58]  that you would open up your word to us.
[1656.64 --> 1657.80]  We pray through your Holy Spirit.
[1658.18 --> 1659.70]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1662.06 --> 1663.70]  So I want to begin this morning
[1663.70 --> 1666.04]  with a word association.
[1667.08 --> 1668.30]  So I'm going to say a word,
[1668.94 --> 1671.08]  and I want you to think the first thing
[1671.08 --> 1673.44]  that comes to your mind when I say it.
[1674.64 --> 1675.90]  And so here's the word.
[1676.52 --> 1678.56]  What comes to your mind at the word?
[1679.56 --> 1679.96]  Wilderness.
[1682.24 --> 1682.68]  Wilderness.
[1683.76 --> 1688.18]  For me, the idea of wilderness is good.
[1688.88 --> 1690.64]  It has good associations.
[1690.92 --> 1694.18]  I think of rugged, unspoiled beauty,
[1694.40 --> 1696.72]  of snow-capped mountains like we can see
[1696.72 --> 1699.86]  as we look north here in Vancouver.
[1701.12 --> 1703.48]  And the other idea it has for me
[1703.48 --> 1705.76]  is of being away from people,
[1706.00 --> 1708.56]  being kind of in solitude.
[1709.44 --> 1712.96]  You know, when my wife Christy and I were in Taiwan,
[1712.96 --> 1714.14]  we had just moved to Taiwan.
[1714.30 --> 1715.76]  We met an old missionary
[1715.76 --> 1719.04]  who had lived and served there for like 25 years.
[1720.10 --> 1722.38]  And so a few months after us being there
[1722.38 --> 1723.56]  and getting settled in,
[1723.92 --> 1725.60]  he took us on a little outing
[1725.60 --> 1728.38]  to get us out of the heat
[1728.38 --> 1731.74]  and the noise and the bustle of the city.
[1731.74 --> 1735.42]  And he brought us into the mountains
[1735.42 --> 1737.92]  where it was cool, it was beautiful.
[1738.12 --> 1740.16]  We spent a wonderful day,
[1740.42 --> 1743.12]  just a peaceful day walking together
[1743.12 --> 1747.08]  along these mountain trails through bamboo forests.
[1747.08 --> 1748.62]  It was amazing.
[1748.62 --> 1751.70]  And so we're up on this mountain
[1751.70 --> 1754.12]  and we came to a fork in the trail, two paths.
[1755.06 --> 1756.00]  And we're trying to decide,
[1756.10 --> 1758.72]  well, which way actually gets us home eventually.
[1759.72 --> 1762.62]  We look over to the right where that path leads
[1762.62 --> 1765.56]  and our missionary friend said,
[1766.08 --> 1770.00]  oh no, look, people, let's go the other way.
[1771.18 --> 1773.56]  And then he says, jokingly,
[1773.80 --> 1775.14]  I'm a great missionary, right?
[1775.14 --> 1778.88]  You know, obviously missionaries don't want to avoid people,
[1779.32 --> 1780.76]  but we all long for solitude.
[1781.40 --> 1783.86]  And in fact, kind of to redeem himself in a way.
[1784.40 --> 1786.56]  Later on on the path, we met a man
[1786.56 --> 1788.06]  and he just got to talking with him
[1788.06 --> 1789.10]  and sharing the gospel with him.
[1789.32 --> 1790.20]  He was a good missionary.
[1791.42 --> 1793.94]  But also we go to the wilderness,
[1794.10 --> 1796.64]  not only for things like the nature
[1796.64 --> 1798.76]  and the nobleness of it,
[1799.00 --> 1801.32]  but it gives us a chance to get away from people.
[1802.78 --> 1805.10]  So those are good associations that I have
[1805.10 --> 1805.68]  with wilderness.
[1805.90 --> 1808.20]  But in the Bible, when we read of wilderness,
[1808.94 --> 1811.62]  it is not seen as a good thing at all.
[1812.32 --> 1816.94]  In the Bible, you do not want to be in the wilderness.
[1818.42 --> 1820.90]  You know, so think about Adam and Eve.
[1821.48 --> 1824.00]  The last time we see them, what are they doing?
[1824.74 --> 1826.66]  They're leaving the garden.
[1826.66 --> 1830.04]  They're going out into the wilderness.
[1830.66 --> 1833.10]  They're going out away from God's presence.
[1833.10 --> 1838.32]  The wilderness is where God's people wandered for years
[1838.32 --> 1841.20]  before they entered into the promised land
[1841.20 --> 1842.88]  and found their new home.
[1843.80 --> 1847.50]  The wilderness is where King David hid from an angry
[1847.50 --> 1850.60]  and violent king who was seeking his life.
[1851.84 --> 1854.40]  The wilderness is where Jesus went
[1854.40 --> 1857.92]  to fast and to be tempted by the devil.
[1857.92 --> 1860.56]  And so in the Bible,
[1860.78 --> 1862.74]  your goal, if you are in the wilderness,
[1863.46 --> 1864.98]  is to get out of the wilderness
[1864.98 --> 1867.28]  and to get back home.
[1867.80 --> 1871.16]  And especially to be back in God's presence.
[1872.46 --> 1873.82]  And so in our passage here,
[1873.88 --> 1877.12]  we find these words spoken by John the Baptist,
[1877.32 --> 1880.72]  but taken from the Old Testament prophet Isaiah.
[1880.72 --> 1883.88]  And when Isaiah was writing,
[1884.60 --> 1887.58]  God's people were in the wilderness.
[1888.52 --> 1891.94]  Isaiah is writing to the people of Israel,
[1892.16 --> 1894.82]  but they're not in Israel.
[1895.06 --> 1895.88]  They're not home.
[1896.54 --> 1900.20]  They had been exiled far away into Babylon.
[1901.00 --> 1902.86]  Exiled away from their homes,
[1903.22 --> 1906.10]  sent away into captivity in a foreign land,
[1906.10 --> 1908.38]  away from God's presence
[1908.38 --> 1912.10]  because of their sin and their idolatry.
[1913.30 --> 1915.10]  And friends, although we,
[1915.68 --> 1918.10]  this world is all that we have ever known,
[1918.64 --> 1921.44]  and it is beautiful and wonderful in so many ways,
[1922.20 --> 1924.26]  it can still feel like a wilderness.
[1924.96 --> 1927.84]  Because this good creation that God had made good
[1927.84 --> 1928.76]  and called good,
[1929.20 --> 1930.08]  because of sin,
[1930.18 --> 1931.68]  has been broken and fragmented.
[1932.40 --> 1934.52]  And so we live in this world that is our home,
[1934.52 --> 1936.10]  and yet we are not fully home
[1936.10 --> 1938.14]  because we are separated
[1938.14 --> 1939.88]  from the immediate presence of God.
[1940.84 --> 1944.46]  And sin has caused destruction in so many ways.
[1945.20 --> 1947.12]  We can think about this year, 2020,
[1947.38 --> 1949.62]  where several hundred thousand people
[1949.62 --> 1952.52]  have died worldwide because of a pandemic.
[1953.68 --> 1958.56]  And then all of the wilderness-related trouble
[1958.56 --> 1960.22]  that has also come from it.
[1960.22 --> 1963.10]  But we experience the wilderness
[1963.10 --> 1965.38]  in other areas of our lives as well.
[1966.10 --> 1967.12]  For some of us,
[1967.22 --> 1969.94]  maybe we feel like we're losing our children.
[1971.12 --> 1972.62]  Or for others of us,
[1972.66 --> 1975.60]  we feel that our bodies are failing with sickness.
[1976.90 --> 1978.16]  And really for all of us,
[1978.22 --> 1981.54]  we struggle with shame in different ways,
[1982.16 --> 1985.40]  in that those ways where we are not trusting
[1985.40 --> 1989.02]  and seeking God to fulfill our longings.
[1989.02 --> 1991.60]  But we're looking to other things.
[1993.28 --> 1995.32]  And when you've been in the wilderness,
[1996.44 --> 2000.10]  what you long for is to get home.
[2000.74 --> 2002.64]  To get home where you belong,
[2002.76 --> 2003.74]  where you are loved.
[2004.68 --> 2006.44]  We long to be out of the wilderness
[2006.44 --> 2008.94]  and brought back into God's presence.
[2010.52 --> 2012.24]  And so the question for us is,
[2012.42 --> 2013.28]  how does that happen?
[2013.28 --> 2017.06]  How does Jesus come to us in our lives,
[2017.28 --> 2019.82]  in the midst of our wilderness?
[2020.56 --> 2022.76]  And how can he lead us home?
[2022.92 --> 2024.62]  And how can we, in that way,
[2024.70 --> 2026.78]  receive his salvation?
[2027.50 --> 2029.52]  And that's what I want us to consider this morning
[2029.52 --> 2031.42]  from this text.
[2032.00 --> 2032.64]  And so this morning,
[2032.68 --> 2034.90]  I want us to look at this in three different ways.
[2035.46 --> 2037.14]  We're going to look at the call of salvation,
[2037.84 --> 2039.46]  the contours of salvation,
[2039.46 --> 2042.10]  and then finally, the comfort of salvation.
[2042.10 --> 2046.44]  Okay, and so first, the call of salvation.
[2048.34 --> 2050.96]  In our passage, we have here
[2050.96 --> 2052.82]  the public ministry of John the Baptist.
[2053.26 --> 2056.22]  And remember, John is the child
[2056.22 --> 2059.16]  who was born to Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[2059.34 --> 2061.40]  the one we looked at in the first week
[2061.40 --> 2062.68]  of our series here.
[2063.32 --> 2064.96]  And the role of John the Baptist
[2064.96 --> 2067.00]  was to prepare the way,
[2067.00 --> 2069.96]  prepare the people of God
[2069.96 --> 2072.08]  for God to come to them.
[2072.60 --> 2075.24]  God himself was going to come,
[2075.60 --> 2077.56]  and he was going to lead his people
[2077.56 --> 2078.78]  out of their wilderness.
[2080.16 --> 2081.64]  But now let's get practical.
[2082.76 --> 2086.32]  How do I actually receive this Jesus
[2086.32 --> 2087.32]  who is to come?
[2087.88 --> 2089.60]  John chapter 1 says,
[2089.60 --> 2091.88]  To all who receive him,
[2092.28 --> 2094.88]  he gave the right to become children of God.
[2095.26 --> 2097.14]  So how do we actually receive him?
[2097.18 --> 2099.46]  How do we actually become children of God
[2099.46 --> 2100.60]  to receive the salvation
[2100.60 --> 2101.96]  that he has come to give us?
[2103.26 --> 2105.46]  Well, John the Baptist tells us
[2105.46 --> 2108.84]  with this wonderful illustration here.
[2109.64 --> 2110.70]  He says,
[2110.70 --> 2135.14]  And so friends,
[2135.20 --> 2137.00]  there's some historical background to this.
[2137.70 --> 2138.54]  Back then,
[2138.54 --> 2141.20]  you didn't have paved roads.
[2141.48 --> 2142.48]  That's what we're used to.
[2142.54 --> 2143.44]  We drive in our cars.
[2143.58 --> 2144.96]  We can get from place to place
[2144.96 --> 2146.88]  on these amazing roads that we have
[2146.88 --> 2147.84]  that we take for granted.
[2148.28 --> 2148.92]  But back then,
[2148.94 --> 2150.18]  you didn't have paved roads.
[2150.78 --> 2152.72]  A road was really just a place
[2152.72 --> 2154.68]  where animals kept walking
[2154.68 --> 2157.14]  or people had kept walking.
[2157.58 --> 2158.36]  And after a while,
[2158.46 --> 2158.82]  basically,
[2159.00 --> 2160.08]  you have some tracks
[2160.08 --> 2161.12]  carved into the ground.
[2161.66 --> 2163.64]  So nobody built roads
[2163.64 --> 2166.68]  unless you were a king.
[2166.68 --> 2168.54]  And when the king
[2168.54 --> 2170.26]  wanted to go on a journey
[2170.26 --> 2172.58]  and go visit your town,
[2173.00 --> 2175.10]  he would send his heralds
[2175.10 --> 2177.20]  and his engineers ahead of him.
[2177.70 --> 2178.62]  And they'd come
[2178.62 --> 2179.34]  and they'd say,
[2179.84 --> 2181.04]  The king is coming.
[2181.62 --> 2183.10]  Prepare the king's highway.
[2184.22 --> 2186.30]  And if the king comes for a visit,
[2186.84 --> 2189.26]  you had to prepare things.
[2189.74 --> 2190.26]  Right?
[2190.42 --> 2191.68]  Because if you or I
[2191.68 --> 2193.56]  come to a gully in the road,
[2193.56 --> 2195.22]  well, we just have to take our cart
[2195.22 --> 2196.20]  down the gully
[2196.20 --> 2197.42]  and pull it up
[2197.42 --> 2198.52]  to the other side.
[2199.42 --> 2200.66]  And if you and I
[2200.66 --> 2202.54]  come to a boulder in the road,
[2203.64 --> 2203.94]  you know,
[2204.02 --> 2205.04]  we can't move the boulder.
[2205.26 --> 2206.40]  We're just going to have to find
[2206.40 --> 2207.56]  our way around it.
[2208.78 --> 2211.02]  But when the king comes,
[2211.90 --> 2212.12]  and right,
[2212.18 --> 2213.46]  not just a little regional king,
[2213.52 --> 2214.06]  when we're talking about
[2214.06 --> 2216.62]  the king of kings,
[2217.58 --> 2219.32]  when that king comes,
[2219.46 --> 2220.34]  you had to prepare
[2220.34 --> 2221.22]  a smooth road.
[2221.70 --> 2223.38]  He is coming with his entourage.
[2223.38 --> 2225.68]  He is coming in honor.
[2227.10 --> 2228.56]  The king's not going to climb
[2228.56 --> 2229.52]  over boulders.
[2229.98 --> 2231.16]  The king is not going to climb
[2231.16 --> 2232.12]  down into gullies.
[2233.98 --> 2234.70]  Okay, but,
[2234.82 --> 2235.72]  so that's the background.
[2235.92 --> 2236.90]  But in this case,
[2236.94 --> 2238.52]  when John is saying these words,
[2239.16 --> 2239.94]  who is coming?
[2240.82 --> 2242.26]  Because we're not just talking
[2242.26 --> 2244.20]  about boulders being taken down
[2244.20 --> 2246.00]  by those king's engineers.
[2246.46 --> 2248.22]  We're talking about mountains
[2248.22 --> 2249.88]  being taken down.
[2250.70 --> 2251.80]  And we're not just talking
[2251.80 --> 2252.72]  about little gullies
[2252.72 --> 2253.46]  being filled in.
[2253.54 --> 2254.20]  We're talking about
[2254.20 --> 2255.78]  entire valleys
[2255.78 --> 2257.70]  being filled.
[2258.68 --> 2260.24]  So who is John the Baptist
[2260.24 --> 2260.98]  talking about?
[2261.58 --> 2262.74]  Well, he's talking about,
[2262.86 --> 2263.32]  of course,
[2263.70 --> 2265.04]  the ultimate king.
[2265.38 --> 2267.94]  The king of the entire universe.
[2269.18 --> 2269.98]  And John says,
[2270.10 --> 2271.74]  the way you prepare the way
[2271.74 --> 2272.84]  for this king
[2272.84 --> 2275.12]  is not with roads,
[2275.12 --> 2276.86]  but with repentance.
[2277.78 --> 2280.00]  That is what John came to do
[2280.00 --> 2281.34]  is to prepare his people
[2281.34 --> 2282.90]  to receive this king
[2282.90 --> 2284.12]  by calling them
[2284.12 --> 2285.36]  to repentance.
[2286.56 --> 2287.64]  John 3 says,
[2288.44 --> 2289.80]  John went proclaiming
[2289.80 --> 2290.68]  a baptism
[2290.68 --> 2292.24]  of repentance
[2292.24 --> 2293.64]  for the forgiveness
[2293.64 --> 2294.62]  of sins.
[2295.92 --> 2297.12]  See, to receive Jesus
[2297.12 --> 2298.10]  as your king,
[2298.76 --> 2300.62]  you don't mend your roads.
[2301.24 --> 2302.66]  You mend your life.
[2302.66 --> 2304.34]  You come to prepare
[2304.34 --> 2305.10]  your heart
[2305.10 --> 2306.22]  so that Christ
[2306.22 --> 2308.12]  has full access.
[2309.66 --> 2310.98]  So the question then is,
[2311.08 --> 2311.94]  well, what's repentance?
[2313.08 --> 2314.28]  And repentance means
[2314.28 --> 2317.56]  not just doing good things
[2317.56 --> 2319.68]  or not doing bad things.
[2320.00 --> 2320.98]  It means turning
[2320.98 --> 2323.16]  your whole self
[2323.16 --> 2324.40]  toward God.
[2324.94 --> 2327.24]  It's to prepare for him,
[2327.54 --> 2329.00]  to recognize him as king.
[2329.34 --> 2331.82]  It's to let him be God.
[2331.82 --> 2333.72]  It's to take all of your roads,
[2333.80 --> 2335.64]  your own map that you have,
[2336.32 --> 2337.62]  and instead of calling God
[2337.62 --> 2338.78]  to walk on your roads
[2338.78 --> 2340.00]  the way you have designed them,
[2340.26 --> 2342.84]  it is to make his paths straight.
[2343.80 --> 2345.46]  Let him be the king
[2345.46 --> 2346.20]  in your life.
[2347.60 --> 2349.10]  It's like in the Christmas carol
[2349.10 --> 2350.58]  that we sing joy to the world.
[2351.10 --> 2351.60]  We sing,
[2351.94 --> 2353.94]  let every heart do what?
[2355.48 --> 2357.08]  Prepare him room.
[2358.12 --> 2360.08]  And that is how Jesus comes to you.
[2360.08 --> 2361.54]  You receive him
[2361.54 --> 2362.94]  as the Lord
[2362.94 --> 2363.70]  and the king
[2363.70 --> 2365.28]  of your life
[2365.28 --> 2366.82]  by preparing him room,
[2366.88 --> 2367.54]  making way
[2367.54 --> 2368.58]  for the king.
[2369.48 --> 2370.62]  And when you do that,
[2370.66 --> 2371.82]  as John says here,
[2372.36 --> 2373.70]  your sins are forgiven.
[2374.52 --> 2376.44]  He gives you his grace.
[2377.04 --> 2378.62]  You become a child of God.
[2378.70 --> 2379.60]  You become part
[2379.60 --> 2380.48]  of the king's family.
[2381.36 --> 2382.92]  Your shame is removed,
[2383.46 --> 2385.28]  and you're on your way
[2385.28 --> 2386.58]  out of the wilderness
[2386.58 --> 2388.62]  to your promised home.
[2389.92 --> 2391.24]  And we all long
[2391.24 --> 2393.38]  for this kind of king,
[2393.48 --> 2394.38]  a good king,
[2394.86 --> 2396.10]  a mighty king
[2396.10 --> 2397.98]  who can come
[2397.98 --> 2399.56]  and who can lead us out
[2399.56 --> 2400.64]  of the wilderness
[2400.64 --> 2401.50]  in our lives.
[2402.52 --> 2403.96]  And so that's the first point.
[2404.24 --> 2405.14]  And that kind of brings us
[2405.14 --> 2406.06]  to the second point
[2406.06 --> 2406.84]  we want to talk about
[2406.84 --> 2407.36]  this morning,
[2407.46 --> 2407.92]  which is
[2407.92 --> 2408.58]  the contours
[2409.28 --> 2410.30]  of salvation.
[2411.24 --> 2412.40]  When we receive Jesus
[2412.40 --> 2413.64]  as king in our lives,
[2413.86 --> 2415.42]  we receive his salvation.
[2415.42 --> 2417.18]  He has come to save us.
[2417.96 --> 2418.58]  And of course,
[2418.70 --> 2420.84]  we don't have to
[2420.84 --> 2423.82]  do good things.
[2423.92 --> 2424.78]  We don't have to earn
[2424.78 --> 2427.54]  his coming to us,
[2427.64 --> 2429.28]  but we do have to receive it.
[2429.34 --> 2431.14]  And that's what this image is
[2431.14 --> 2432.82]  of making these roads straight,
[2433.22 --> 2434.58]  is receiving him as king.
[2435.16 --> 2436.56]  But after we prepared
[2436.56 --> 2437.46]  for the way
[2437.46 --> 2438.50]  for Jesus to come
[2438.50 --> 2440.34]  and to reign in our hearts
[2440.34 --> 2441.00]  and lives,
[2441.78 --> 2442.08]  friends,
[2442.16 --> 2442.98]  now we are on
[2442.98 --> 2443.46]  a pilgrimage.
[2443.46 --> 2445.16]  We are on
[2445.16 --> 2446.40]  an incredible journey
[2446.40 --> 2448.20]  and a sojourn.
[2448.54 --> 2449.42]  And it's a life
[2449.42 --> 2450.76]  coming,
[2451.00 --> 2451.84]  walking with God
[2451.84 --> 2452.84]  out of the wilderness.
[2453.74 --> 2454.86]  Walking in the wilderness
[2454.86 --> 2455.98]  that we are in now
[2455.98 --> 2456.56]  in this life,
[2456.64 --> 2457.52]  but eventually to
[2457.52 --> 2459.78]  being with God
[2459.78 --> 2461.20]  in the intermediate state
[2461.20 --> 2461.96]  in heaven
[2461.96 --> 2462.64]  after we die
[2462.64 --> 2464.32]  and then into this home,
[2464.76 --> 2465.40]  the new heavens
[2465.40 --> 2466.16]  and the new earth.
[2467.58 --> 2468.32]  And so now,
[2468.42 --> 2469.58]  what is this life all about?
[2469.58 --> 2470.60]  But it's actually
[2470.60 --> 2472.00]  a continual repentance.
[2472.66 --> 2473.34]  It's a continual
[2473.34 --> 2474.22]  turning to God
[2474.22 --> 2474.64]  in faith
[2474.64 --> 2475.56]  in every area
[2475.56 --> 2476.40]  of our lives
[2476.40 --> 2477.34]  to take all
[2477.34 --> 2478.94]  of those crooked paths
[2478.94 --> 2479.52]  that we find
[2479.52 --> 2480.50]  in our own hearts
[2480.50 --> 2481.82]  and to straighten them
[2481.82 --> 2482.44]  so that God
[2482.44 --> 2483.68]  can come and be king
[2483.68 --> 2485.58]  in all of those places
[2485.58 --> 2486.20]  and areas
[2486.20 --> 2486.90]  in our lives
[2486.90 --> 2488.14]  where we rely
[2488.14 --> 2488.88]  on him more
[2488.88 --> 2489.46]  and more.
[2490.90 --> 2491.08]  You know,
[2491.14 --> 2493.20]  before there was GPS,
[2494.58 --> 2495.38]  kids,
[2495.54 --> 2495.74]  maybe,
[2495.82 --> 2496.06]  I don't know
[2496.06 --> 2496.56]  if you've seen
[2496.56 --> 2496.96]  one of these,
[2497.06 --> 2497.52]  this is called
[2497.52 --> 2498.92]  a topographical map.
[2499.72 --> 2500.52]  And so if you actually
[2500.52 --> 2501.30]  wanted to go out
[2501.30 --> 2501.88]  in the wilderness
[2501.88 --> 2502.50]  or you wanted
[2502.50 --> 2503.66]  to go on a trip,
[2504.28 --> 2505.34]  you would get a map
[2505.34 --> 2506.40]  and you would see
[2506.40 --> 2507.24]  where you are,
[2507.34 --> 2508.32]  where you want to go.
[2508.48 --> 2508.90]  You would see
[2508.90 --> 2510.02]  all the hills
[2510.02 --> 2510.94]  and the valleys
[2510.94 --> 2512.62]  and all of the paths.
[2514.38 --> 2514.98]  And so,
[2515.18 --> 2517.02]  let's take a cue
[2517.02 --> 2518.54]  from the illustration
[2518.54 --> 2519.64]  that John the Baptist
[2519.64 --> 2520.38]  gives us
[2520.38 --> 2522.00]  and kind of following
[2522.00 --> 2522.62]  in the footsteps
[2522.62 --> 2524.80]  of Dante's Divine Comedy
[2524.80 --> 2526.54]  or John Bunyan's
[2526.54 --> 2527.26]  Pilgrim's Progress
[2527.26 --> 2528.74]  let's talk about
[2528.74 --> 2529.60]  what this road
[2529.60 --> 2530.48]  through the wilderness
[2530.48 --> 2531.22]  looks like.
[2531.84 --> 2532.56]  We'll call this
[2532.56 --> 2533.38]  the contours
[2533.38 --> 2534.10]  of salvation.
[2535.40 --> 2535.68]  And so,
[2535.78 --> 2536.34]  looking again
[2536.34 --> 2537.24]  at this illustration,
[2537.52 --> 2538.56]  there's a couple things
[2538.56 --> 2539.66]  that we see.
[2540.72 --> 2541.96]  The first one is
[2541.96 --> 2542.92]  that paths
[2542.92 --> 2543.92]  need to be made straight.
[2545.06 --> 2545.28]  You know,
[2545.36 --> 2546.40]  when you're traveling
[2546.40 --> 2547.64]  through the wilderness,
[2548.14 --> 2549.60]  you want the paths
[2549.60 --> 2550.52]  to be as short
[2550.52 --> 2551.36]  as possible.
[2552.44 --> 2553.44]  And as we walk
[2553.44 --> 2554.34]  through the wilderness
[2554.34 --> 2555.10]  on the road
[2555.10 --> 2555.84]  to salvation,
[2555.84 --> 2557.60]  we need to help
[2557.60 --> 2558.08]  each other
[2558.08 --> 2559.28]  not wander off
[2559.28 --> 2559.98]  the path.
[2560.56 --> 2560.80]  I mean,
[2560.82 --> 2561.32]  if we know
[2561.32 --> 2562.28]  where we're going,
[2563.04 --> 2564.22]  stay on the path.
[2565.16 --> 2566.00]  And this is why
[2566.00 --> 2566.90]  the Bible talks
[2566.90 --> 2568.00]  about dropping
[2568.00 --> 2568.98]  all the stuff
[2568.98 --> 2569.90]  that hinders us
[2569.90 --> 2570.66]  on the journey.
[2571.90 --> 2572.82]  Hebrews 12 says,
[2572.90 --> 2573.62]  let us throw off
[2573.62 --> 2574.76]  everything that hinders
[2574.76 --> 2576.48]  the sin that so easily
[2576.48 --> 2577.76]  entangles us.
[2578.28 --> 2579.24]  Let us run
[2579.24 --> 2580.38]  with perseverance
[2580.38 --> 2581.30]  the race
[2581.30 --> 2582.22]  marked out
[2582.22 --> 2582.98]  for us.
[2582.98 --> 2585.50]  When you're
[2585.50 --> 2586.88]  in a race,
[2587.44 --> 2588.14]  you want to run
[2588.14 --> 2589.18]  the shortest line.
[2589.36 --> 2590.30]  You don't run
[2590.30 --> 2591.80]  in crooked ways
[2591.80 --> 2592.88]  because that slows
[2592.88 --> 2593.52]  you down.
[2594.60 --> 2594.80]  You know,
[2594.86 --> 2595.82]  when I was in high school,
[2596.10 --> 2597.50]  I ski raced
[2597.50 --> 2598.72]  for one year.
[2599.48 --> 2600.32]  I wasn't that
[2600.32 --> 2601.44]  very fast at it.
[2602.02 --> 2603.72]  But in downhill skiing,
[2604.46 --> 2605.38]  the skiers,
[2605.70 --> 2606.70]  they have to go
[2606.70 --> 2608.18]  around these poles.
[2608.58 --> 2609.50]  But they don't make
[2609.50 --> 2610.78]  very wide loops.
[2610.78 --> 2611.34]  They want to go
[2611.34 --> 2612.52]  as straight as possible.
[2612.98 --> 2613.90]  And they even do that
[2613.90 --> 2615.10]  by knocking down
[2615.10 --> 2615.86]  the poles that are
[2615.86 --> 2616.56]  in their path
[2616.56 --> 2617.44]  going around them.
[2619.12 --> 2619.52]  And friends,
[2619.60 --> 2620.36]  when you and I
[2620.36 --> 2621.30]  are coming out
[2621.30 --> 2621.88]  of the wilderness,
[2623.04 --> 2624.72]  when we're coming
[2624.72 --> 2625.92]  home from exile,
[2626.42 --> 2627.76]  you don't want to carry
[2627.76 --> 2628.38]  a bunch of
[2628.38 --> 2629.48]  unnecessary stuff.
[2629.86 --> 2630.92]  You don't want to walk
[2630.92 --> 2632.30]  in very crooked ways.
[2633.04 --> 2634.14]  We need to go
[2634.14 --> 2635.40]  in very straight paths.
[2636.82 --> 2638.42]  The second kind of cue
[2638.42 --> 2639.02]  we can take
[2639.02 --> 2639.90]  from this illustration
[2639.90 --> 2641.34]  is that valleys
[2641.34 --> 2642.14]  need to be filled.
[2643.16 --> 2643.98]  When you're walking
[2643.98 --> 2644.80]  through the wilderness,
[2645.28 --> 2646.42]  you want to avoid
[2646.42 --> 2647.12]  the valleys.
[2648.06 --> 2648.28]  You know,
[2648.32 --> 2648.86]  if you've ever been
[2648.86 --> 2649.66]  hiking, say,
[2649.76 --> 2651.18]  maybe hiking up
[2651.18 --> 2652.00]  to Garibaldi,
[2652.40 --> 2653.22]  on the trail,
[2653.32 --> 2654.06]  sometimes you come
[2654.06 --> 2655.10]  to these little bridges
[2655.10 --> 2656.16]  that help you cross
[2656.16 --> 2657.22]  over streams
[2657.22 --> 2657.92]  and gullies.
[2658.26 --> 2658.72]  They're not those
[2658.72 --> 2659.22]  big ones,
[2659.30 --> 2660.52]  but just a way
[2660.52 --> 2661.22]  to smooth out
[2661.22 --> 2661.76]  the path.
[2662.54 --> 2663.68]  They build these bridges
[2663.68 --> 2664.62]  in order to make
[2664.62 --> 2665.84]  the path easier
[2665.84 --> 2666.70]  to travel on.
[2667.54 --> 2667.78]  You know,
[2667.82 --> 2668.52]  because you don't want
[2668.52 --> 2669.30]  to send the path
[2669.30 --> 2671.10]  down into a valley
[2671.10 --> 2672.70]  unless you really
[2672.70 --> 2673.36]  need to
[2673.36 --> 2674.76]  because going down
[2674.76 --> 2676.56]  is lost ground.
[2677.84 --> 2678.66]  You're just going to
[2678.66 --> 2679.54]  have to come back up
[2679.54 --> 2679.82]  again.
[2681.48 --> 2682.52]  And so as we leave
[2682.52 --> 2683.18]  the wilderness
[2683.18 --> 2684.16]  on the road
[2684.16 --> 2684.88]  to salvation,
[2685.78 --> 2686.86]  we're to help each other
[2686.86 --> 2687.82]  out of the valleys.
[2688.52 --> 2689.62]  Because if we know
[2689.62 --> 2690.54]  where we're going,
[2691.20 --> 2692.70]  don't go on detours
[2692.70 --> 2694.40]  that distract you
[2694.40 --> 2695.96]  and waste your energy
[2695.96 --> 2697.00]  going downhill
[2697.00 --> 2698.56]  and that waste
[2698.56 --> 2699.28]  your years,
[2700.08 --> 2701.50]  you will only
[2701.50 --> 2702.60]  have to come
[2702.60 --> 2703.48]  back up again.
[2704.62 --> 2705.52]  The valleys
[2705.52 --> 2706.86]  make many promises
[2706.86 --> 2708.58]  that they can't keep.
[2711.62 --> 2712.34]  Third,
[2712.84 --> 2713.44]  the mountains
[2713.44 --> 2714.86]  are to be made low.
[2715.94 --> 2717.00]  On your road
[2717.00 --> 2717.82]  out of the wilderness,
[2718.26 --> 2719.18]  on this path
[2719.18 --> 2719.80]  of salvation,
[2720.36 --> 2722.08]  there are obstacles
[2722.08 --> 2723.36]  you can't go around.
[2723.36 --> 2724.76]  Right?
[2724.82 --> 2725.66]  You see these mountains
[2725.66 --> 2726.44]  on the map
[2726.44 --> 2728.26]  and they can't be avoided.
[2729.24 --> 2730.18]  And there are things
[2730.18 --> 2730.70]  in life
[2730.70 --> 2731.88]  that we all
[2731.88 --> 2732.80]  have to face.
[2733.08 --> 2733.96]  All of us
[2733.96 --> 2734.96]  without exception.
[2735.94 --> 2736.08]  Right?
[2736.16 --> 2737.26]  There are no surprises
[2737.26 --> 2737.96]  about it.
[2738.42 --> 2739.64]  You knew you had
[2739.64 --> 2741.02]  to face this thing.
[2741.52 --> 2742.44]  You can't get rid
[2742.44 --> 2742.96]  of a mountain.
[2744.18 --> 2745.26]  But how can you
[2745.26 --> 2745.96]  make it low?
[2747.02 --> 2747.32]  Well,
[2747.44 --> 2748.74]  we can pay attention
[2748.74 --> 2749.56]  to what God
[2749.56 --> 2750.62]  tells us in the Bible
[2750.62 --> 2752.08]  and live according
[2752.08 --> 2752.98]  to his wisdom.
[2754.02 --> 2754.16]  Right?
[2754.22 --> 2755.62]  Because not obeying God
[2755.62 --> 2756.92]  and not listening to him
[2756.92 --> 2758.38]  brings all kinds
[2758.38 --> 2758.80]  of trouble
[2758.80 --> 2759.66]  into our lives
[2759.66 --> 2760.48]  as well as pain
[2760.48 --> 2761.00]  and suffering.
[2762.12 --> 2762.24]  Right?
[2762.30 --> 2762.84]  So often,
[2762.96 --> 2763.74]  the trouble we face
[2763.74 --> 2764.24]  in life,
[2765.14 --> 2765.94]  not everything,
[2766.16 --> 2767.26]  but so many things,
[2767.50 --> 2768.66]  our trouble could be avoided
[2768.66 --> 2769.92]  if we would only
[2769.92 --> 2771.00]  listen to God
[2771.00 --> 2771.80]  and follow him.
[2772.76 --> 2773.38]  The mountains
[2773.38 --> 2775.14]  seem way higher
[2775.14 --> 2776.60]  when we don't
[2776.60 --> 2777.24]  approach them
[2777.24 --> 2777.88]  God's way.
[2777.88 --> 2782.16]  in the last
[2782.16 --> 2783.26]  illustration
[2783.26 --> 2783.98]  we have
[2783.98 --> 2784.90]  from our passage
[2784.90 --> 2785.88]  is that the rough
[2785.88 --> 2786.78]  places are to be
[2786.78 --> 2787.44]  made smooth.
[2788.60 --> 2788.84]  Now,
[2788.88 --> 2789.36]  when you're hiking
[2789.36 --> 2790.10]  through the wilderness,
[2790.54 --> 2791.76]  you can't see
[2791.76 --> 2792.72]  every rock
[2792.72 --> 2793.92]  and every root
[2793.92 --> 2794.66]  on your path.
[2795.26 --> 2796.44]  Those rough places
[2796.44 --> 2797.58]  are not on your map.
[2798.52 --> 2799.58]  So when you're walking
[2799.58 --> 2800.38]  on the path,
[2800.52 --> 2800.86]  suddenly,
[2801.10 --> 2801.86]  you might trip
[2801.86 --> 2802.52]  over something
[2802.52 --> 2804.32]  or fall into something.
[2805.56 --> 2807.22]  Not every hardship
[2807.22 --> 2808.40]  is predictable,
[2809.54 --> 2810.94]  but as the people
[2810.94 --> 2811.46]  of God,
[2811.56 --> 2812.22]  we are to help
[2812.22 --> 2812.68]  each other
[2812.68 --> 2813.34]  even through
[2813.34 --> 2815.16]  those rough places.
[2816.14 --> 2817.08]  We can rely
[2817.08 --> 2817.70]  on the Lord
[2817.70 --> 2818.40]  to make these
[2818.40 --> 2819.56]  rough places smooth
[2819.56 --> 2821.00]  and lift us up
[2821.00 --> 2822.26]  when we stumble.
[2823.46 --> 2823.72]  And so,
[2823.84 --> 2823.98]  friends,
[2824.06 --> 2824.58]  we're kind of
[2824.58 --> 2826.04]  allegorizing this passage
[2826.04 --> 2826.70]  in this way
[2826.70 --> 2827.60]  to talk about
[2827.60 --> 2829.52]  the path of salvation
[2829.52 --> 2830.50]  that we walk on.
[2831.24 --> 2832.00]  And the thing
[2832.00 --> 2832.90]  about this path
[2832.90 --> 2833.52]  of salvation
[2833.52 --> 2835.32]  is that these mountains
[2835.32 --> 2836.30]  that we have,
[2836.70 --> 2837.66]  God can make low
[2837.66 --> 2838.32]  in our lives.
[2838.70 --> 2839.42]  These valleys
[2839.42 --> 2840.26]  that we can tend
[2840.26 --> 2841.08]  to fall in
[2841.08 --> 2842.78]  and waste so much
[2842.78 --> 2843.70]  time and energy,
[2844.12 --> 2845.86]  He can fill them in
[2845.86 --> 2847.08]  and lift them up.
[2847.66 --> 2847.86]  And so,
[2847.94 --> 2849.10]  not only do we
[2849.10 --> 2850.06]  prepare paths
[2850.06 --> 2850.42]  for God
[2850.42 --> 2851.48]  to come into our lives,
[2851.50 --> 2852.64]  but even as we walk
[2852.64 --> 2853.32]  with Him,
[2853.72 --> 2854.54]  He is preparing
[2854.54 --> 2855.62]  a path for us.
[2856.18 --> 2857.00]  That doesn't mean
[2857.00 --> 2857.94]  it's not a path
[2857.94 --> 2858.54]  through the wilderness.
[2859.00 --> 2859.68]  It doesn't mean
[2859.68 --> 2860.38]  that there aren't
[2860.38 --> 2861.60]  obstacles in our way.
[2862.00 --> 2862.94]  There aren't
[2862.94 --> 2864.24]  valleys that we
[2864.24 --> 2865.36]  might have to walk on.
[2865.80 --> 2867.44]  But God is with us
[2867.44 --> 2868.90]  and He walks with us.
[2869.44 --> 2870.38]  And we have each other
[2870.38 --> 2871.88]  to walk on this journey
[2871.88 --> 2872.60]  with as well.
[2873.80 --> 2874.24]  And so,
[2874.32 --> 2875.40]  we're all on this
[2875.40 --> 2876.14]  path,
[2876.26 --> 2876.80]  this journey
[2876.80 --> 2877.70]  of salvation
[2877.70 --> 2878.24]  together.
[2879.70 --> 2880.40]  And friends,
[2880.46 --> 2881.04]  that brings us
[2881.04 --> 2882.84]  to start our third
[2882.84 --> 2883.64]  and final point
[2883.64 --> 2884.14]  this morning,
[2884.58 --> 2885.74]  which is
[2885.74 --> 2886.22]  the comfort
[2886.22 --> 2887.04]  of salvation.
[2888.40 --> 2888.92]  You know,
[2888.92 --> 2890.06]  looking back
[2890.06 --> 2890.94]  at this passage
[2890.94 --> 2891.98]  that John quotes
[2891.98 --> 2893.12]  from in Isaiah 40,
[2893.88 --> 2894.72]  here's actually
[2894.72 --> 2895.94]  how it continues
[2895.94 --> 2898.28]  in the prophet Isaiah.
[2900.14 --> 2901.34]  He says this,
[2901.34 --> 2930.90]  God's people,
[2931.34 --> 2932.64]  are in the midst
[2932.64 --> 2933.94]  of an incredible
[2933.94 --> 2934.42]  pilgrimage,
[2935.06 --> 2935.62]  a journey,
[2935.78 --> 2936.42]  a sojourn.
[2937.08 --> 2937.86]  And our hope
[2937.86 --> 2938.32]  and comfort
[2938.32 --> 2939.28]  on this pilgrimage
[2939.28 --> 2940.68]  that we are all on
[2940.68 --> 2941.98]  is the presence
[2941.98 --> 2942.66]  and power
[2942.66 --> 2943.52]  of Christ
[2943.52 --> 2944.92]  who sojourns
[2944.92 --> 2945.56]  with us.
[2946.56 --> 2946.76]  Right?
[2946.90 --> 2948.48]  Jesus is the salvation
[2948.48 --> 2949.52]  that God spoke of.
[2950.22 --> 2951.78]  He knows what the exile
[2951.78 --> 2952.54]  in the wilderness
[2952.54 --> 2953.14]  are like.
[2953.24 --> 2954.70]  He left heaven,
[2954.70 --> 2956.78]  he left God's presence,
[2956.88 --> 2957.56]  he came into
[2957.56 --> 2958.18]  this wilderness
[2958.18 --> 2958.82]  and he came
[2958.82 --> 2959.56]  to find us.
[2959.84 --> 2960.84]  He came like a shepherd
[2960.84 --> 2962.82]  to find his lost sheep.
[2963.98 --> 2965.30]  He understands
[2965.30 --> 2966.82]  where we are,
[2967.34 --> 2968.14]  he understands
[2968.14 --> 2968.94]  the mountains
[2968.94 --> 2969.54]  and the valleys
[2969.54 --> 2970.30]  that we face.
[2971.68 --> 2972.26]  And so friends,
[2972.34 --> 2973.18]  just kind of as a
[2973.18 --> 2975.00]  way of application
[2975.00 --> 2975.96]  to think about this
[2975.96 --> 2976.82]  in your own lives,
[2977.38 --> 2979.08]  if you have left
[2979.08 --> 2979.76]  the path,
[2980.32 --> 2981.44]  if you are walking
[2981.44 --> 2983.00]  on a crooked way,
[2983.00 --> 2985.68]  come to your senses
[2985.68 --> 2987.58]  and return to Jesus.
[2988.48 --> 2988.70]  Right?
[2988.80 --> 2990.04]  He is the good shepherd.
[2990.58 --> 2991.32]  He cares about
[2991.32 --> 2992.18]  each and every one
[2992.18 --> 2992.82]  of his sheep.
[2993.48 --> 2994.76]  He comes to you
[2994.76 --> 2995.76]  and he welcomes you
[2995.76 --> 2997.00]  to follow him
[2997.00 --> 2997.70]  on this journey.
[3000.10 --> 3001.08]  Maybe there's
[3001.08 --> 3001.94]  some heavy baggage
[3001.94 --> 3002.78]  that you're carrying
[3002.78 --> 3004.40]  that you need to drop
[3004.40 --> 3005.92]  because it's of no help
[3005.92 --> 3006.44]  to you
[3006.44 --> 3007.78]  on this journey.
[3009.36 --> 3010.84]  And if you wandered off
[3010.84 --> 3011.64]  into some valley
[3011.64 --> 3013.06]  and you're living
[3013.06 --> 3013.80]  as if you're not
[3013.80 --> 3014.70]  a child of God,
[3014.86 --> 3015.94]  don't waste any more
[3015.94 --> 3016.54]  time on it.
[3017.82 --> 3018.02]  You know,
[3018.06 --> 3019.26]  we long for salvation
[3019.26 --> 3020.36]  as people.
[3021.10 --> 3021.96]  And sometimes we think
[3021.96 --> 3022.60]  that salvation
[3022.60 --> 3023.82]  is found in some
[3023.82 --> 3025.02]  other person
[3025.02 --> 3026.24]  or other place
[3026.24 --> 3027.66]  or other thing
[3027.66 --> 3028.58]  or experience.
[3029.46 --> 3030.00]  But friends,
[3030.94 --> 3032.52]  Jesus is our salvation.
[3032.80 --> 3033.48]  That is what John
[3033.48 --> 3034.30]  is telling us here.
[3034.84 --> 3035.80]  He's our salvation.
[3036.02 --> 3037.26]  He is the only one
[3037.26 --> 3038.98]  who can fill you.
[3038.98 --> 3040.20]  He's the only one
[3040.20 --> 3041.10]  who can satisfy
[3041.10 --> 3042.54]  your desires
[3042.54 --> 3043.48]  to go home
[3043.48 --> 3044.96]  to find salvation.
[3046.26 --> 3047.00]  And if you are facing
[3047.00 --> 3047.60]  some mountain
[3047.60 --> 3048.88]  or if you've fallen
[3048.88 --> 3049.96]  on a rough place,
[3050.04 --> 3050.80]  you are not alone.
[3051.54 --> 3052.20]  The Lord Jesus
[3052.20 --> 3053.84]  has faced this also.
[3055.22 --> 3056.26]  He has come to us.
[3056.36 --> 3057.58]  He has lived this life
[3057.58 --> 3058.32]  and experienced
[3058.32 --> 3059.62]  all of its pains
[3059.62 --> 3060.44]  and temptations
[3060.44 --> 3061.88]  though he was without sin.
[3062.76 --> 3063.78]  And he loves you
[3063.78 --> 3064.82]  and he is with you
[3064.82 --> 3066.52]  now and forever
[3066.52 --> 3068.14]  as you make your way home.
[3068.14 --> 3069.86]  And he will see to it
[3069.86 --> 3070.78]  that he brings you
[3070.78 --> 3072.62]  finally home with him.
[3073.48 --> 3074.52]  That is the salvation
[3074.52 --> 3075.90]  that we celebrate
[3075.90 --> 3077.02]  and that has come to us
[3077.02 --> 3078.14]  in the birth
[3078.14 --> 3081.50]  of this child Jesus.
[3082.38 --> 3082.88]  And so friends,
[3083.02 --> 3084.04]  let's make,
[3084.60 --> 3085.72]  prepare a room for him
[3085.72 --> 3086.38]  in our hearts.
[3086.72 --> 3088.32]  Let us make his path straight.
[3089.16 --> 3090.22]  Let's receive him
[3090.22 --> 3091.32]  as our king.
[3091.98 --> 3093.42]  And let's pray together
[3093.42 --> 3094.36]  for those things.
[3094.36 --> 3098.56]  Our heavenly father,
[3098.70 --> 3099.60]  we pray that
[3099.60 --> 3101.54]  you would apply
[3101.54 --> 3102.46]  this passage
[3102.46 --> 3104.00]  to our hearts
[3104.00 --> 3105.40]  and to our lives
[3105.40 --> 3106.52]  and in all of
[3106.52 --> 3107.54]  our own individual
[3107.54 --> 3108.26]  circumstances
[3108.26 --> 3109.14]  that we have.
[3110.00 --> 3110.32]  Lord,
[3110.42 --> 3111.54]  you know where we are
[3111.54 --> 3112.32]  on this journey.
[3113.26 --> 3114.02]  Some of us
[3114.02 --> 3115.54]  are still learning
[3115.54 --> 3116.78]  how to trust you
[3116.78 --> 3117.60]  and rely on you
[3117.60 --> 3118.36]  in different ways.
[3118.48 --> 3119.14]  Others of us
[3119.14 --> 3120.54]  have made it
[3120.54 --> 3121.68]  quite far along.
[3121.68 --> 3123.12]  but Lord,
[3123.28 --> 3124.06]  still there are
[3124.06 --> 3124.88]  rough places.
[3125.86 --> 3126.22]  But Lord,
[3126.38 --> 3127.28]  we're on this journey
[3127.28 --> 3127.76]  together
[3127.76 --> 3129.06]  and you are with us.
[3129.76 --> 3130.70]  You are the good shepherd
[3130.70 --> 3131.70]  who is leading us.
[3132.76 --> 3133.30]  So Father,
[3133.40 --> 3134.28]  we pray that
[3134.28 --> 3136.08]  we would
[3136.08 --> 3138.02]  make way
[3138.02 --> 3139.36]  for this king of kings,
[3139.46 --> 3140.44]  the ultimate king
[3140.44 --> 3141.36]  in our lives.
[3141.80 --> 3142.96]  That we would submit
[3142.96 --> 3143.48]  to him.
[3144.30 --> 3145.52]  We pray for your help
[3145.52 --> 3146.28]  in Jesus' name.
[3147.24 --> 3147.54]  Amen.
[3147.54 --> 3147.68]  Amen.
[3151.68 --> 3155.34]  And I've just been
[3155.34 --> 3156.16]  informed that actually
[3156.16 --> 3156.86]  you've not been able
[3156.86 --> 3158.10]  to see any words.
[3158.46 --> 3160.06]  So I'm sorry for that.
[3160.80 --> 3162.28]  So I'm going to give you
[3162.28 --> 3162.74]  the numbers
[3162.74 --> 3163.86]  if you have the hymnals
[3163.86 --> 3164.60]  at home.
[3165.00 --> 3166.02]  So in the red book
[3166.02 --> 3168.18]  it is 590
[3168.18 --> 3169.32]  and if you have
[3169.32 --> 3170.10]  the grey hymnal
[3170.10 --> 3171.80]  it's 501.
[3171.80 --> 3188.98]  O for a thousand tongues
[3188.98 --> 3189.80]  to sing
[3189.80 --> 3194.12]  my great Redeemer's praise
[3194.12 --> 3198.12]  The glories of my God
[3198.12 --> 3198.82]  and King
[3198.82 --> 3200.78]  The triumphs
[3200.78 --> 3203.24]  of His grace
[3203.24 --> 3205.34]  My gracious
[3205.34 --> 3206.36]  Master
[3206.36 --> 3208.30]  and my God
[3208.30 --> 3210.08]  Assist me
[3210.08 --> 3212.40]  to proclaim
[3212.40 --> 3214.34]  To spend
[3214.34 --> 3215.38]  through all
[3215.38 --> 3216.70]  the earth
[3216.70 --> 3217.38]  the birth
[3217.38 --> 3219.20]  The honors
[3219.20 --> 3221.84]  of your name
[3221.84 --> 3224.04]  He speaks
[3224.04 --> 3225.32]  and listening
[3225.32 --> 3227.14]  to His words
[3227.14 --> 3228.58]  Through life
[3228.58 --> 3231.32]  the dead receive
[3231.32 --> 3233.26]  The mindful
[3233.26 --> 3234.26]  broken
[3234.26 --> 3236.06]  hearts rejoice
[3236.06 --> 3237.66]  The humble
[3237.66 --> 3240.56]  poor believe
[3240.56 --> 3243.96]  Look unto Him
[3243.96 --> 3245.28]  Your Savior
[3245.28 --> 3247.40]  O whole
[3247.40 --> 3250.16]  in human race
[3250.16 --> 3253.02]  Who can be saved
[3253.02 --> 3254.24]  through faith
[3254.24 --> 3254.96]  alone
[3254.96 --> 3256.92]  Be justified
[3256.92 --> 3259.50]  by grace
[3259.50 --> 3261.82]  To God
[3261.82 --> 3263.12]  all glory
[3263.12 --> 3264.96]  praise and love
[3264.96 --> 3267.78]  be now and ever
[3267.78 --> 3269.46]  given
[3269.46 --> 3271.26]  Our sins
[3271.26 --> 3272.16]  below
[3272.16 --> 3273.72]  and saints
[3273.72 --> 3274.46]  above
[3274.46 --> 3276.14]  The church
[3276.14 --> 3277.38]  of earth
[3277.38 --> 3279.34]  and heaven
[3279.34 --> 3286.42]  So friends
[3286.42 --> 3287.16]  let's continue
[3287.16 --> 3287.68]  to worship
[3287.68 --> 3288.20]  the Lord
[3288.20 --> 3288.82]  in a prayer
[3288.82 --> 3289.58]  of supplication
[3289.58 --> 3290.34]  Will you please
[3290.34 --> 3291.14]  join me in prayer?
[3297.38 --> 3298.64]  Lord we recognize
[3298.64 --> 3300.46]  that there is
[3300.46 --> 3301.52]  good news
[3301.52 --> 3303.44]  of a great joy
[3303.44 --> 3304.52]  given to us
[3304.52 --> 3305.10]  in Christ
[3305.10 --> 3306.82]  and we do
[3306.82 --> 3307.48]  celebrate
[3307.48 --> 3307.72]  great
[3307.72 --> 3310.10]  but that celebration
[3310.10 --> 3311.56]  for some of us
[3311.56 --> 3312.84]  comes as a deep
[3312.84 --> 3313.46]  act
[3313.46 --> 3314.46]  of faith
[3314.46 --> 3316.24]  because this
[3316.24 --> 3316.98]  has been
[3316.98 --> 3318.00]  a hard season
[3318.00 --> 3320.12]  Lord we pray
[3320.12 --> 3320.76]  for those
[3320.76 --> 3321.32]  for whom
[3321.32 --> 3322.28]  Christmas has
[3322.28 --> 3323.44]  been
[3323.44 --> 3324.72]  a deep
[3324.72 --> 3325.34]  disappointment
[3325.34 --> 3327.58]  painful
[3327.58 --> 3328.44]  conversations
[3328.44 --> 3329.34]  arose
[3329.34 --> 3330.90]  and we are
[3330.90 --> 3331.86]  sorry for it
[3331.86 --> 3333.64]  or things
[3333.64 --> 3334.40]  that were
[3334.40 --> 3335.06]  hoped for
[3335.06 --> 3335.50]  did not
[3335.50 --> 3335.98]  happen
[3335.98 --> 3336.56]  and we
[3336.56 --> 3337.36]  grieve
[3337.36 --> 3338.10]  that loss
[3338.10 --> 3339.80]  or people
[3339.80 --> 3340.32]  we love
[3340.32 --> 3340.66]  were not
[3340.66 --> 3341.20]  able to be
[3341.20 --> 3341.78]  with us
[3341.78 --> 3342.12]  and we
[3342.12 --> 3342.56]  mourn
[3342.56 --> 3343.36]  their absence
[3343.36 --> 3345.00]  so Lord
[3345.00 --> 3345.40]  be with
[3345.40 --> 3345.72]  those
[3345.72 --> 3346.10]  for whom
[3346.10 --> 3346.48]  Christmas
[3346.48 --> 3347.18]  was not
[3347.18 --> 3347.86]  a great
[3347.86 --> 3348.30]  joy
[3348.30 --> 3349.30]  Lord
[3349.30 --> 3349.68]  and grant
[3349.68 --> 3349.86]  them
[3349.86 --> 3350.28]  comfort
[3350.28 --> 3352.32]  and Lord
[3352.32 --> 3352.70]  we pray
[3352.70 --> 3353.18]  for those
[3353.18 --> 3353.46]  in our
[3353.46 --> 3353.96]  community
[3353.96 --> 3355.34]  whose needs
[3355.34 --> 3356.60]  are great
[3356.60 --> 3357.92]  but resources
[3357.92 --> 3358.84]  are scarce
[3358.84 --> 3360.38]  we ask
[3360.38 --> 3360.72]  that you
[3360.72 --> 3361.18]  would meet
[3361.18 --> 3361.52]  them
[3361.52 --> 3361.82]  whether
[3361.82 --> 3362.66]  in homelessness
[3362.66 --> 3364.26]  or in food
[3364.26 --> 3364.92]  insecurity
[3364.92 --> 3366.64]  whether it's
[3366.64 --> 3367.28]  in joblessness
[3367.28 --> 3368.30]  or in the
[3368.30 --> 3368.68]  drudgery
[3368.68 --> 3369.22]  of work
[3369.22 --> 3369.66]  that is
[3369.66 --> 3370.22]  unwelcome
[3370.22 --> 3371.26]  and unnoticed
[3371.26 --> 3372.58]  and all
[3372.58 --> 3373.04]  of these
[3373.04 --> 3373.42]  needs
[3373.42 --> 3373.70]  Lord
[3373.70 --> 3374.14]  we pray
[3374.14 --> 3374.54]  that you
[3374.54 --> 3374.88]  would be
[3374.88 --> 3375.38]  present
[3375.38 --> 3376.38]  granting
[3376.38 --> 3376.88]  hope
[3376.88 --> 3379.50]  we pray
[3379.50 --> 3380.66]  for family
[3380.66 --> 3381.28]  and friends
[3381.28 --> 3381.86]  who do not
[3381.86 --> 3382.34]  yet know
[3382.34 --> 3383.06]  the salvation
[3383.06 --> 3383.64]  that Christ
[3383.64 --> 3384.40]  came to bring
[3384.40 --> 3385.68]  who did not
[3385.68 --> 3386.62]  prepare a road
[3386.62 --> 3387.40]  for him
[3387.40 --> 3388.78]  in their hearts
[3388.78 --> 3390.24]  and we ask
[3390.24 --> 3390.94]  that this season
[3390.94 --> 3391.58]  there would be
[3391.58 --> 3392.66]  a ray of hope
[3392.66 --> 3394.28]  and an opportunity
[3394.28 --> 3395.76]  for the gospel
[3395.76 --> 3398.02]  and Lord
[3398.02 --> 3398.48]  we pray
[3398.48 --> 3399.56]  for our world
[3399.56 --> 3401.04]  a world
[3401.04 --> 3401.46]  that has
[3401.46 --> 3401.92]  fallen
[3401.92 --> 3402.60]  and is
[3402.60 --> 3403.12]  fractured
[3403.12 --> 3404.42]  we pray
[3404.42 --> 3404.84]  especially
[3404.84 --> 3405.64]  for the local
[3405.64 --> 3406.26]  and global
[3406.26 --> 3406.90]  ministries
[3406.90 --> 3407.64]  and missionaries
[3407.64 --> 3408.30]  that we support
[3408.30 --> 3408.98]  as a church
[3408.98 --> 3410.00]  would you
[3410.00 --> 3410.46]  strengthen
[3410.46 --> 3411.26]  their witness
[3411.26 --> 3412.38]  would you
[3412.38 --> 3412.86]  give them
[3412.86 --> 3413.38]  faith
[3413.38 --> 3414.48]  and resolve
[3414.48 --> 3415.28]  in the ministry
[3415.28 --> 3415.78]  that you
[3415.78 --> 3416.26]  have called
[3416.26 --> 3416.70]  them to
[3416.70 --> 3418.46]  and in all
[3418.46 --> 3419.00]  things Lord
[3419.00 --> 3419.48]  we ask
[3419.48 --> 3419.84]  that this
[3419.84 --> 3420.28]  Christmas
[3420.28 --> 3420.74]  as we
[3420.74 --> 3421.20]  celebrate
[3421.20 --> 3422.60]  the ongoing
[3422.60 --> 3423.70]  impact
[3423.70 --> 3425.00]  of the birth
[3425.00 --> 3425.40]  of Christ
[3425.40 --> 3426.32]  in our lives
[3426.32 --> 3426.90]  and in our
[3426.90 --> 3427.36]  world
[3427.36 --> 3428.50]  Lord
[3428.50 --> 3428.98]  that you
[3428.98 --> 3429.50]  would be
[3429.50 --> 3429.86]  born
[3429.86 --> 3430.54]  anew
[3430.54 --> 3431.60]  in our
[3431.60 --> 3432.12]  hearts
[3432.12 --> 3433.08]  Lord
[3433.08 --> 3433.58]  would you
[3433.58 --> 3434.02]  be born
[3434.02 --> 3434.56]  anew
[3434.56 --> 3435.24]  in our
[3435.24 --> 3435.82]  families
[3435.82 --> 3437.20]  in our
[3437.20 --> 3437.74]  church
[3437.74 --> 3438.66]  in our
[3438.66 --> 3438.96]  city
[3438.96 --> 3440.66]  we pray
[3440.66 --> 3441.38]  this in the
[3441.38 --> 3441.78]  name of
[3441.78 --> 3442.14]  Jesus
[3442.14 --> 3443.22]  our Lord
[3443.22 --> 3443.96]  and Savior

[3452.08 --> 3453.20]  the blessing
[3453.20 --> 3453.54]  of the

[3456.38 --> 3456.66]  day
[3456.66 --> 3457.60]  so I
[3457.60 --> 3458.02]  invite you
[3458.02 --> 3458.34]  to
