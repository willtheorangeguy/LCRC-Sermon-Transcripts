[240.00 → 243.78] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[243.78 → 251.28] Welcome to this live stream digital worship service this morning at Ladder Christian
[251.28 → 252.06] Reformed Church.
[252.56 → 259.02] So wherever you are, we are so glad that you're joining us, and we want to come before the Lord
[259.02 → 260.58] together as one body.
[260.92 → 261.98] Lift our hearts to him.
[262.16 → 265.16] Worship him this morning on this first Sunday of Advent.
[265.16 → 272.18] And so a quick announcement, our designated offering for this Sunday is the New Immigrant
[272.18 → 273.42] Support Fund.
[274.40 → 281.92] And so the funds are used as we sponsor new immigrants and refugees to come to Canada,
[282.06 → 283.28] become part of our church.
[283.92 → 288.88] And this ministry is funded solely by this kind of special offering for our New Immigrant
[288.88 → 289.52] Support Fund.
[290.18 → 293.66] And so you can give if you'd like online on our website.
[293.66 → 296.90] You can also drop off a check to the church or mail it in.
[298.80 → 306.18] So now let us come and prepare to worship the Lord with a call to worship from the prophet
[306.18 → 306.74] Isaiah.
[307.96 → 310.12] And where it says, leader, I will read.
[310.22 → 314.76] And where it's bolded, I'll ask that you read out loud with me.
[314.76 → 326.22] Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you.
[327.66 → 337.08] Since ancient times, no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you
[337.08 → 340.92] who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
[342.04 → 348.66] You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways.
[349.98 → 353.86] But when we continue to sin against them, you are angry.
[353.86 → 357.64] How then can we be saved?
[359.00 → 361.46] Yet you, Lord, are our Father.
[362.52 → 363.68] We are the clay.
[364.28 → 365.48] You are the potter.
[366.24 → 368.80] We are all the work of your hand.
[370.10 → 373.02] Do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord.
[373.86 → 375.74] Do not remember our sins forever.
[376.62 → 378.20] O look on us, we pray,
[378.62 → 381.00] for we are all your people.
[381.00 → 387.50] So friends, join with me in a prayer of adoration and praise to God.
[387.60 → 388.32] Let's pray together.
[390.96 → 395.14] Lord, we do adore you and praise you this morning
[395.14 → 397.02] because you are our life.
[397.80 → 399.14] You are our salvation.
[400.36 → 402.92] Lord, we worship you as the one who is
[402.92 → 404.90] and who is to come.
[406.28 → 410.72] Lord, in the midst of circumstances that change,
[411.00 → 414.32] Lord, we praise you as the God who is our rock,
[415.02 → 419.18] the stronghold and shelter in any times of trouble.
[420.32 → 424.42] Lord, we come to you in worship knowing that wherever we are,
[425.06 → 426.06] Lord, you are there.
[426.98 → 429.40] We come to you in worship knowing that we
[429.40 → 431.84] can dwell with you in your presence
[431.84 → 433.28] as your people.
[433.28 → 436.44] And that is the most beautiful place to be.
[437.30 → 438.84] So, Lord, we come to you this morning
[438.84 → 441.42] with our praises and our adoration
[441.42 → 445.80] in the trust that we worship the one true and holy God.
[446.32 → 449.08] And we offer you these praises in Christ's holy name.
[449.96 → 450.32] Amen.
[450.32 → 455.44] So, let's sing a couple songs this morning to praise God.
[455.44 → 470.68] Prepare the way of the Lord
[470.68 → 474.66] Prepare the way of the Lord
[474.66 → 477.74] And all people will see
[477.74 → 481.92] The salvation of the God
[481.92 → 485.78] Prepare the way of the Lord
[485.78 → 489.50] Prepare the way of the Lord
[489.50 → 492.82] And all people will see
[492.82 → 496.88] The salvation of the Lord
[496.88 → 500.80] Prepare the way of the Lord
[500.80 → 504.70] Prepare the way of the Lord
[504.70 → 507.76] And all people will see
[507.76 → 511.98] The salvation of the Lord
[511.98 → 515.38] And all people will see
[515.38 → 520.20] The salvation of the God
[526.88 → 535.70] Jesus, help all the nations
[535.70 → 540.80] Jesus, comfort for all who are
[540.80 → 545.80] You are the source of heaven's hope
[545.80 → 547.76] On your own
[547.76 → 552.02] Jesus, light in the darkness
[552.02 → 556.50] Jesus, truth in your circumstances
[556.50 → 563.44] You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[563.44 → 568.16] In history, a living death
[568.16 → 572.90] You broke the chains you rose to life
[572.90 → 577.88] You are the hope, in King in us
[577.88 → 582.00] You are the love, in whom we trust
[582.00 → 584.14] You are the light
[584.14 → 588.86] Shining from all the worlds we see
[588.86 → 592.20] You rose from the dead
[592.20 → 594.30] Conquer in fear
[594.30 → 596.36] Our breath's of peace
[596.36 → 598.28] Driving us near
[598.28 → 600.46] Jesus, our home
[600.46 → 603.88] Living for all who will receive
[603.88 → 608.80] Nor we believe
[608.80 → 619.48] Jesus, hope all the nations
[619.48 → 624.64] Jesus, comfort for all who are
[624.64 → 630.86] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[630.86 → 635.54] Jesus, light in the darkness
[635.54 → 640.10] Jesus, truth in your circumstance
[640.10 → 646.98] You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[646.98 → 651.30] In history, a living death
[651.30 → 656.08] You broke the chains you rose to life
[656.08 → 661.00] You are the hope, in King in us
[661.00 → 665.20] You are the hope, in whom we trust
[665.20 → 667.32] You are the light
[667.32 → 672.20] Shining from all the worlds we see
[672.20 → 675.40] You rose from the dead
[675.40 → 677.08] Conquer in fear
[677.08 → 679.08] Our breath's of peace
[679.08 → 681.08] Driving us near
[681.08 → 683.08] Jesus, our home
[683.08 → 688.08] Living for all who will receive
[688.08 → 691.36] Lord, we believe
[691.36 → 696.08] Lord, we believe
[696.08 → 700.08] Lord, we believe
[700.08 → 715.08] On this first Sunday of Advent
[715.08 → 717.08] We light a candle of hope
[717.08 → 726.66] Isaiah gives us a vision of a kingdom yet to come
[726.66 → 728.66] Where everything has been made new
[728.66 → 730.66] And where creation is at peace
[730.66 → 732.66] The prophet Isaiah writes
[732.66 → 734.66] The shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse
[734.66 → 735.66] From his roots
[735.66 → 737.66] A branch will bear fruit
[737.66 → 741.66] The spirit of the Lord will rest on him
[741.66 → 743.66] The spirit of wisdom and understanding
[743.66 → 746.66] The spirit of counsel and of might
[746.66 → 749.66] The spirit of knowledge and fear of fear
[749.66 → 753.66] And he will delight in the fear of the Lord
[753.66 → 755.66] For Isaiah 11, 1-3
[755.66 → 757.66] We light this candle of hope
[757.66 → 762.66] As the signs of our waiting and longing for the coming of Christ
[762.66 → 763.66] The spirit of wisdom and fear
[763.66 → 764.66] And we hold our wondrous mystery
[764.66 → 768.66] In the dawning of the King
[768.66 → 769.66] In the theme of heaven's praises
[769.66 → 772.66] For behold and frail humanity
[772.66 → 782.62] And behold, our wondrous mystery, in the dawning of the King,
[782.62 → 790.48] be the theme of heaven's praises, brought in frail humanity.
[791.82 → 799.62] In the longing and the darkness, now the light of life has come.
[799.62 → 809.82] Look to Christ who was extended, do not flesh to ransom us.
[815.30 → 824.70] Come behold the wondrous mystery, even perfect Son of man.
[824.70 → 832.70] In His living, in His suffering, never trace nor stain of sin.
[833.98 → 841.70] Seek His joy and better honour, come to save the help of man.
[842.90 → 851.08] Christ the brave and true fulfillment, all in all in Him, we stand.
[851.08 → 851.58] Amen.
[858.36 → 860.08] The is connection.
[860.36 → 866.08] Oh behold, the wondrous mystery, Christ Verde upon the tree.
[866.08 → 871.38] In this day the fluent sinners
[871.38 → 875.02] Is a lamb of victory
[875.02 → 879.74] See the price of our redemption
[879.74 → 884.44] See their fathers plan to fall
[884.44 → 888.82] Bringing many sons to glory
[888.82 → 893.64] Risen measure, love atone
[896.08 → 904.00] Come behold thy wondrous mystery
[904.00 → 908.24] Slave my dear blood, God of life
[908.24 → 912.58] God no grateful, never restrained
[912.58 → 916.80] Risen our feet is alive
[916.80 → 921.22] What authority, self-deliverance
[921.22 → 925.32] How unshivering our hope
[925.32 → 929.40] Blessed power resurrected
[929.40 → 934.10] As we will be when He comes
[934.10 → 938.60] Love, heart, and self-deliverance
[938.60 → 944.24] How unshivering our hope
[944.24 → 949.32] Blessed power resurrected
[949.32 → 955.40] As we will be when He comes
[955.40 → 971.74] So brothers and sisters, Advent is a time of praise
[971.74 → 975.46] Because God has sent His Son into our world
[975.46 → 976.82] In the midst of our darkness
[976.82 → 982.02] At the same time, it's also a time of lament and of hope
[982.02 → 985.22] And so, as our time of confession
[985.22 → 986.50] It's going to be a little bit different
[986.50 → 990.32] It's going to be just a prayer of lament and of hope
[990.32 → 992.84] And this comes from Revelation chapter 3
[992.84 → 996.20] And again, there will be some words I'll ask you to say
[996.20 → 999.42] And so let's go to this prayer
[999.42 → 1001.40] Using the words of Revelation 3
[1001.40 → 1005.48] O Lord, we look for light
[1005.48 → 1007.54] Only to find darkness
[1007.54 → 1010.92] We look for a window of opportunity
[1010.92 → 1013.56] But our view is obstructed
[1013.56 → 1015.68] And yet you say
[1015.68 → 1018.42] I have set before you an open door
[1018.42 → 1020.62] Which no one is able to shut
[1020.62 → 1022.78] May it be so
[1022.78 → 1025.46] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1025.46 → 1055.26] And so also as we pray
[1055.26 → 1057.56] These words of lament
[1057.56 → 1058.68] And also hope
[1058.68 → 1059.98] That Jesus has come again
[1059.98 → 1061.42] That He will come again
[1061.42 → 1063.88] We also are assured
[1063.88 → 1065.36] Of our salvation
[1065.36 → 1066.88] That in His coming
[1066.88 → 1068.24] That He will keep us
[1068.24 → 1070.66] And so let us turn again
[1070.66 → 1071.46] To these words
[1071.46 → 1072.38] And say them with me
[1072.38 → 1075.80] To those of little power
[1075.80 → 1077.64] Who are hanging on by a thread
[1077.64 → 1079.90] Hear these words of promise
[1079.90 → 1082.38] For still the vision awaits
[1082.38 → 1083.38] Its appointed time
[1083.38 → 1085.38] It hastens to the end
[1085.38 → 1086.80] It will not lie
[1086.80 → 1088.74] If it seems slow
[1088.74 → 1090.32] Wait for it
[1090.32 → 1092.22] The Lord says
[1092.22 → 1093.90] I am coming soon
[1093.90 → 1096.36] And to the one who conquers
[1096.36 → 1097.66] I will make them a pillar
[1097.66 → 1099.18] In the temple of my God
[1099.18 → 1100.76] Steadfast
[1100.76 → 1101.86] And immovable
[1101.86 → 1102.88] Forever
[1102.88 → 1105.44] In Christ we are kept
[1105.44 → 1107.92] In Christ we are saved
[1107.92 → 1109.12] Amen
[1109.12 → 1113.42] And so let's sing our song of renewal together
[1113.42 → 1130.18] It is my only comfort
[1130.18 → 1132.88] In my life and in my day
[1132.88 → 1138.12] You have fully paid for all my sins
[1138.12 → 1140.10] and all my debts
[1140.10 → 1142.26] even when I
[1142.26 → 1143.88] struggle to be
[1143.88 → 1146.20] here
[1146.20 → 1148.26] with your precious
[1148.26 → 1150.76] blood you set me free
[1150.76 → 1154.56] I am
[1154.56 → 1156.26] not my own
[1157.10 → 1158.26] but
[1158.26 → 1159.26] behold
[1159.26 → 1162.26] body and soul
[1163.02 → 1164.26] in my
[1164.82 → 1165.96] life
[1165.96 → 1168.88] and in death
[1168.88 → 1170.58] to you
[1170.58 → 1172.06] Lord
[1172.06 → 1174.26] Christ my Lord
[1175.28 → 1177.30] you'll
[1177.30 → 1178.90] preserve my life
[1178.90 → 1180.50] in such a way
[1180.50 → 1182.26] that without you
[1182.26 → 1184.50] not a hair can
[1184.50 → 1186.52] fall from me unless
[1186.52 → 1188.38] you really do
[1188.38 → 1190.48] even when
[1190.48 → 1192.76] I'm lost in desperation
[1192.76 → 1197.64] all things work together
[1197.64 → 1200.10] for my salvation
[1200.10 → 1205.60] I am not my own
[1205.60 → 1207.72] but belong
[1207.72 → 1210.72] body and soul
[1210.72 → 1213.72] in my life
[1213.72 → 1216.64] and in death
[1216.64 → 1217.42] and in death
[1217.42 → 1218.34] to you
[1218.34 → 1220.10] Lord
[1220.10 → 1222.64] Christ my Lord
[1222.64 → 1238.16] always with your
[1238.16 → 1239.48] Holy Spirit
[1239.48 → 1241.94] you will show me
[1241.94 → 1244.74] of eternal life
[1244.74 → 1245.74] and make me
[1245.74 → 1247.76] willing and ready
[1247.76 → 1250.36] even when I
[1250.36 → 1251.18] can't see
[1251.18 → 1252.68] my way through
[1252.68 → 1256.26] from now on
[1256.26 → 1257.06] tomorrow
[1257.06 → 1258.92] is it for you
[1258.92 → 1262.68] I am not
[1262.68 → 1264.68] my own
[1264.68 → 1267.22] but belong
[1267.22 → 1271.22] body and soul
[1271.22 → 1274.22] in my life
[1274.22 → 1277.22] and in death
[1277.22 → 1278.14] to you
[1278.14 → 1280.22] Lord
[1280.22 → 1283.42] Christ my Lord
[1283.42 → 1286.50] I am not
[1286.50 → 1287.24] I am not
[1287.24 → 1289.08] my own
[1289.08 → 1291.34] but belong
[1291.34 → 1295.40] body and soul
[1295.40 → 1298.50] in my life
[1298.50 → 1301.64] and in death
[1301.64 → 1303.46] to you
[1303.46 → 1305.10] Lord
[1305.10 → 1309.34] Christ my Lord
[1309.34 → 1320.14] it's a beautiful song
[1320.14 → 1320.78] I love that one
[1320.78 → 1323.00] so as we come
[1323.00 → 1324.24] to God's word
[1324.24 → 1324.84] this morning
[1324.84 → 1325.50] would you please
[1325.50 → 1326.02] join me
[1326.02 → 1326.60] in a prayer of
[1326.60 → 1327.18] illumination
[1327.18 → 1327.90] let's pray
[1327.90 → 1330.64] our father
[1330.64 → 1332.36] we come to you
[1332.36 → 1332.96] because you are
[1332.96 → 1333.44] the light
[1333.44 → 1334.44] in our darkness
[1334.44 → 1336.40] Lord you are
[1336.40 → 1337.12] the truth
[1337.12 → 1338.20] in the midst
[1338.20 → 1340.42] of falseness
[1340.42 → 1342.10] Lord you are
[1342.10 → 1342.48] wisdom
[1342.48 → 1343.02] when we don't
[1343.02 → 1343.72] know what to do
[1343.72 → 1345.26] and so Lord
[1345.26 → 1346.04] we come to you

[1355.40 → 1356.48] in faith
[1356.48 → 1357.96] to trust in you
[1357.96 → 1358.92] to look to you
[1358.92 → 1361.24] so Lord be with us
[1361.24 → 1362.30] we pray in Jesus name
[1362.30 → 1363.48] Amen
[1363.48 → 1365.64] so again
[1365.64 → 1366.46] as we mentioned
[1366.46 → 1367.60] this is the first Sunday
[1367.60 → 1369.16] in the church season
[1369.16 → 1369.88] of Advent
[1369.88 → 1371.10] and so I want to
[1371.10 → 1371.68] take a moment
[1371.68 → 1373.52] to explain this
[1373.52 → 1374.52] because the church
[1374.52 → 1375.50] calendar
[1375.50 → 1376.94] may be new
[1376.94 → 1377.82] to some of you
[1377.82 → 1379.94] and so in the same way
[1379.94 → 1380.74] that we have
[1380.74 → 1382.34] a national calendar
[1382.34 → 1383.04] when we kind of
[1383.04 → 1383.92] have all these holidays
[1383.92 → 1384.62] that come throughout
[1384.62 → 1385.12] the year
[1385.12 → 1386.30] in the same way
[1386.30 → 1387.52] we have a school calendar
[1387.52 → 1388.32] that tells us
[1388.32 → 1389.78] when school begins
[1389.78 → 1390.54] and when we might
[1390.54 → 1391.40] have days off
[1391.40 → 1392.34] and semesters
[1392.34 → 1394.38] and so we also
[1394.38 → 1395.68] have a church calendar
[1395.68 → 1397.42] the church calendar
[1397.42 → 1398.70] revolves around
[1398.70 → 1400.08] the events
[1400.08 → 1401.04] in the life
[1401.04 → 1402.00] of Jesus
[1402.00 → 1403.88] and it's kept
[1403.88 → 1404.52] by Christians
[1404.52 → 1405.50] in many nations
[1405.50 → 1406.68] and in many cultures
[1406.68 → 1408.30] and it's been kept
[1408.30 → 1408.96] by Christians
[1408.96 → 1410.52] over many centuries
[1410.52 → 1412.62] and I find that
[1412.62 → 1413.56] exciting
[1413.56 → 1414.44] and encouraging
[1414.44 → 1415.60] and so
[1415.60 → 1416.82] this is the first day
[1416.82 → 1418.08] the first Sunday
[1418.08 → 1418.52] of Advent
[1418.52 → 1419.46] not only here
[1419.46 → 1420.04] in Latin
[1420.04 → 1420.92] or British Columbia
[1420.92 → 1422.32] but also
[1422.32 → 1423.60] in Thailand
[1423.60 → 1425.70] and in France
[1425.70 → 1427.26] and in Australia
[1427.26 → 1428.90] and in Nigeria
[1428.90 → 1429.96] and in Ecuador
[1429.96 → 1431.74] all around the world
[1431.74 → 1433.92] and so we begin
[1433.92 → 1435.08] the church year
[1435.08 → 1436.18] in Advent
[1436.18 → 1438.00] and the church
[1438.00 → 1439.80] for a very long time
[1439.80 → 1440.26] has said
[1440.26 → 1441.36] that this is a season
[1441.36 → 1442.10] in which
[1442.10 → 1443.60] we acknowledge
[1443.60 → 1445.20] our longing
[1445.20 → 1447.50] just as Israel
[1447.50 → 1447.98] waited
[1447.98 → 1449.40] for many long
[1449.40 → 1450.12] centuries
[1450.12 → 1452.04] for the promised Messiah
[1452.04 → 1453.34] to finally come
[1453.34 → 1454.94] so now
[1454.94 → 1455.60] today
[1455.60 → 1456.54] the church
[1456.54 → 1457.96] awaits
[1457.96 → 1459.36] the second Advent
[1459.36 → 1460.72] the return
[1460.72 → 1461.60] of the king
[1461.60 → 1462.54] to come
[1462.54 → 1463.20] in glory
[1463.20 → 1463.82] and to renew
[1463.82 → 1464.64] all things
[1464.64 → 1466.40] you know
[1466.40 → 1467.30] and the Bible
[1467.30 → 1467.80] tells us
[1467.80 → 1468.88] we have made a mess
[1468.88 → 1469.68] of absolutely
[1469.68 → 1470.22] everything
[1470.22 → 1471.62] that God
[1471.62 → 1472.70] has given to us
[1472.70 → 1474.18] and so
[1474.18 → 1474.96] we need
[1474.96 → 1475.86] the good king
[1475.86 → 1476.58] to come
[1476.58 → 1478.20] and to reign
[1478.20 → 1479.34] among us
[1479.34 → 1480.58] in justice
[1480.58 → 1482.84] and in gentleness
[1482.84 → 1484.48] and that's what
[1484.48 → 1485.26] we long for
[1485.26 → 1486.20] right
[1486.20 → 1487.14] we are waiting
[1487.14 → 1487.98] and we are longing
[1487.98 → 1488.52] for Jesus
[1488.52 → 1489.74] to come again
[1489.74 → 1491.20] to complete
[1491.20 → 1492.86] his work of redemption
[1492.86 → 1493.96] in our hearts
[1493.96 → 1495.12] and in this world
[1495.12 → 1496.98] you know
[1496.98 → 1497.32] and
[1497.32 → 1498.62] we've been doing
[1498.62 → 1499.62] a lot of waiting
[1499.62 → 1500.48] these days
[1500.48 → 1502.38] and I don't know you
[1502.38 → 1503.30] but I don't have much
[1503.30 → 1503.80] like
[1503.80 → 1504.98] all the waiting
[1504.98 → 1506.12] that we have
[1506.12 → 1506.70] been doing
[1506.70 → 1507.78] you know
[1507.78 → 1508.26] we're waiting
[1508.26 → 1509.00] for this pandemic
[1509.00 → 1509.66] to be over
[1509.66 → 1510.32] for things to
[1510.32 → 1511.46] return to normal
[1511.46 → 1512.26] but we also wait
[1512.26 → 1513.12] for other things
[1513.12 → 1515.02] and I want to
[1515.02 → 1515.60] share
[1515.60 → 1516.72] a little
[1516.72 → 1518.50] children's worship
[1518.50 → 1519.04] song
[1519.04 → 1520.18] about waiting
[1520.18 → 1521.66] so I just want
[1521.66 → 1522.24] to put the first
[1522.24 → 1522.92] verse up on the
[1522.92 → 1523.74] screen for us
[1523.74 → 1525.12] and I didn't know
[1525.12 → 1525.66] if we could actually
[1525.66 → 1526.44] play the song
[1526.44 → 1527.34] due to copyright
[1527.34 → 1528.50] but I'll just
[1528.50 → 1529.18] read the words
[1529.18 → 1530.70] so here's a song
[1530.70 → 1531.84] it says
[1531.84 → 1532.82] when you write a letter
[1532.82 → 1533.72] to a friend
[1533.72 → 1535.28] and you don't know
[1535.28 → 1535.86] when
[1535.86 → 1536.74] you'll hear back
[1536.74 → 1537.16] again
[1537.16 → 1538.82] well it's hard
[1538.82 → 1539.50] to wait
[1539.50 → 1541.02] it's hard to wait
[1541.02 → 1542.92] so hard to wait
[1542.92 → 1544.20] and then the next
[1544.20 → 1544.56] line
[1544.56 → 1546.22] says when the one
[1546.22 → 1546.80] you love
[1546.80 → 1547.92] leaves on a plane
[1547.92 → 1549.60] and you know
[1549.60 → 1550.86] that she'll come
[1550.86 → 1551.64] back someday
[1551.64 → 1553.28] well it's hard
[1553.28 → 1553.74] to wait
[1553.74 → 1554.92] it's hard to wait
[1554.92 → 1556.46] so hard to wait
[1556.46 → 1559.22] and so when this
[1559.22 → 1560.22] album first came
[1560.22 → 1560.50] out
[1560.50 → 1561.46] it's a whole album
[1561.46 → 1562.22] advent album
[1562.22 → 1562.72] for children
[1562.72 → 1563.50] I really recommend
[1563.50 → 1563.80] it
[1563.80 → 1564.78] when it first
[1564.78 → 1565.08] came out
[1565.08 → 1565.54] a couple of years
[1565.54 → 1566.22] ago we were
[1566.22 → 1567.02] you know my
[1567.02 → 1567.60] family we were
[1567.60 → 1568.18] at home in the
[1568.18 → 1568.62] living room
[1568.62 → 1569.06] and we had
[1569.06 → 1569.94] this song playing
[1569.94 → 1570.86] kind of in the
[1570.86 → 1571.20] background
[1571.20 → 1573.02] and I just
[1573.02 → 1574.24] remember my
[1574.24 → 1575.16] son Abram
[1575.16 → 1575.78] we were listening
[1575.78 → 1576.24] to this
[1576.24 → 1576.92] and he was
[1576.92 → 1578.08] you know very
[1578.08 → 1579.64] moved and touched
[1579.64 → 1580.34] by the words
[1580.34 → 1580.98] and he just kind
[1580.98 → 1581.86] of said out loud
[1581.86 → 1583.50] it is hard
[1583.50 → 1584.00] to wait
[1584.00 → 1586.48] you know
[1586.48 → 1587.00] and I think
[1587.00 → 1587.84] that's kind of
[1587.84 → 1588.76] what we're all
[1588.76 → 1589.38] saying right now
[1589.38 → 1590.08] it is hard
[1590.08 → 1590.44] to wait
[1590.44 → 1592.36] and so I
[1592.36 → 1593.34] encourage you
[1593.34 → 1594.72] to let this
[1594.72 → 1595.32] season of
[1595.32 → 1595.80] advent
[1595.80 → 1597.66] be a time
[1597.66 → 1598.12] of longing
[1598.12 → 1599.58] right we
[1599.58 → 1600.28] long for
[1600.28 → 1600.90] COVID to be
[1600.90 → 1601.60] over and in
[1601.60 → 1602.42] a similar way
[1602.42 → 1603.60] let's learn
[1603.60 → 1604.24] what it means
[1604.24 → 1605.46] to also long
[1605.46 → 1606.58] for Jesus
[1606.58 → 1607.58] to return
[1607.58 → 1608.18] and mend
[1608.18 → 1609.10] everything that
[1609.10 → 1610.14] has been broken
[1610.14 → 1610.82] in the world
[1610.82 → 1612.64] and to help
[1612.64 → 1613.42] us do that
[1613.42 → 1614.96] we're going
[1614.96 → 1615.58] to look
[1615.58 → 1616.38] to the gospel
[1616.38 → 1616.96] of Luke
[1616.96 → 1618.22] in a new
[1618.22 → 1618.86] sermon series
[1618.86 → 1619.36] for advent
[1619.36 → 1620.44] called king
[1620.44 → 1621.18] of our longing
[1621.18 → 1622.70] and we're going
[1622.70 → 1623.18] to consider
[1623.18 → 1623.88] together how
[1623.88 → 1625.02] Jesus is
[1625.02 → 1625.70] the king
[1625.70 → 1627.02] of our
[1627.02 → 1627.72] longings
[1627.72 → 1628.78] and how
[1628.78 → 1629.72] he promises
[1629.72 → 1631.24] to fulfill
[1631.24 → 1631.90] the deepest
[1631.90 → 1632.64] desires that
[1632.64 → 1633.24] we have
[1633.24 → 1633.64] as men
[1633.64 → 1634.06] and women
[1634.06 → 1634.86] and children
[1634.86 → 1636.64] so each week
[1636.64 → 1636.94] we're going
[1636.94 → 1637.36] to look at
[1637.36 → 1637.94] a different
[1637.94 → 1639.04] aspect
[1639.04 → 1640.36] of our longing
[1640.36 → 1641.10] and today
[1641.10 → 1641.86] the longing
[1641.86 → 1643.12] that this
[1643.12 → 1644.06] passage talks
[1644.06 → 1644.42] about
[1644.42 → 1645.46] is our
[1645.46 → 1646.16] longing for
[1646.16 → 1646.56] joy
[1646.56 → 1647.60] our longing
[1647.60 → 1648.10] for joy
[1648.10 → 1648.76] so we're going
[1648.76 → 1649.14] to be looking
[1649.14 → 1649.86] at the beginning
[1649.86 → 1650.54] of the story
[1650.54 → 1651.50] in the gospel
[1651.50 → 1651.98] of Luke
[1651.98 → 1652.76] we'll be reading
[1652.76 → 1653.54] chapter 1
[1653.54 → 1654.64] verses 5
[1654.64 → 1655.28] to 25
[1655.28 → 1657.46] and this morning
[1657.46 → 1657.86] we're going
[1657.86 → 1658.38] to look at
[1658.38 → 1658.80] our longing
[1658.80 → 1659.74] for joy
[1659.74 → 1661.10] that we
[1661.10 → 1661.86] have
[1661.86 → 1662.80] in the midst
[1662.80 → 1663.50] of the
[1663.50 → 1664.22] barrenness
[1664.22 → 1665.52] of the world
[1665.52 → 1665.96] that we
[1665.96 → 1666.74] experience
[1666.74 → 1667.18] in our
[1667.18 → 1668.00] daily lives
[1668.00 → 1670.56] and what
[1670.56 → 1671.44] Luke wants
[1671.44 → 1671.76] to make
[1671.76 → 1672.36] crystal clear
[1672.36 → 1672.94] to us
[1672.94 → 1674.08] is that
[1674.08 → 1675.00] no sort
[1675.00 → 1675.66] of barrenness
[1675.66 → 1677.00] and not
[1677.00 → 1677.68] the barrenness
[1677.68 → 1678.24] of our
[1678.24 → 1679.22] own circumstances
[1679.22 → 1680.78] not the
[1680.78 → 1681.20] barrenness
[1681.20 → 1681.82] of the world
[1681.82 → 1682.32] in general
[1682.32 → 1683.04] and not the
[1683.04 → 1683.44] barrenness
[1683.44 → 1683.88] of our own
[1683.88 → 1684.44] hearts
[1684.44 → 1685.36] nothing can
[1685.36 → 1685.88] get in the
[1685.88 → 1686.28] way of
[1686.28 → 1687.38] God's promise
[1687.38 → 1688.66] to fulfill
[1688.66 → 1689.98] our longing
[1689.98 → 1691.00] for deep
[1691.00 → 1691.52] and abiding
[1691.52 → 1691.98] joy
[1691.98 → 1693.14] that comes
[1693.14 → 1694.04] only through
[1694.04 → 1694.40] him
[1694.40 → 1695.20] because only
[1695.20 → 1695.76] he can give
[1695.76 → 1696.34] us that joy
[1696.34 → 1697.70] and so
[1697.70 → 1698.32] follow along
[1698.32 → 1698.80] with me
[1698.80 → 1699.90] as I read
[1699.90 → 1700.48] just the
[1700.48 → 1700.94] first few
[1700.94 → 1701.28] verses
[1701.28 → 1701.64] and we'll
[1701.64 → 1701.86] kind of
[1701.86 → 1702.22] just work
[1702.22 → 1702.62] through the
[1702.62 → 1703.10] text that
[1703.10 → 1703.32] way
[1703.32 → 1704.20] so we'll
[1704.20 → 1704.82] read verses
[1704.82 → 1706.30] 5 to 7
[1706.30 → 1709.28] in the time
[1709.28 → 1709.80] of Herod
[1709.80 → 1710.42] king of
[1710.42 → 1711.22] Judea
[1711.22 → 1711.98] there was
[1711.98 → 1712.66] a priest
[1712.66 → 1713.52] named
[1713.52 → 1714.18] Zechariah
[1714.18 → 1715.46] who belonged
[1715.46 → 1715.92] to the
[1715.92 → 1716.28] priestly
[1716.28 → 1716.82] division
[1716.82 → 1718.00] of Abijah
[1718.00 → 1719.38] his wife
[1719.38 → 1719.82] Elizabeth
[1719.82 → 1721.26] was also
[1721.26 → 1722.32] a descendant
[1722.32 → 1723.18] of Aaron
[1723.18 → 1725.70] both of
[1725.70 → 1725.96] them
[1725.96 → 1726.28] were
[1726.28 → 1726.70] righteous
[1726.70 → 1727.20] in the
[1727.20 → 1727.38] sight
[1727.38 → 1727.84] of God
[1727.84 → 1728.84] observing
[1728.84 → 1729.44] all the
[1729.44 → 1729.78] Lord's
[1729.78 → 1730.32] commands
[1730.32 → 1731.40] and decrees
[1731.40 → 1732.54] blamelessly
[1732.54 → 1734.00] but they
[1734.00 → 1734.84] were childless
[1734.84 → 1736.18] because Elizabeth
[1736.18 → 1736.86] was not
[1736.86 → 1737.50] able to
[1737.50 → 1738.04] conceive
[1738.04 → 1739.12] and they
[1739.12 → 1739.72] were both
[1739.72 → 1740.44] very old
[1740.44 → 1742.92] okay
[1742.92 → 1743.52] so
[1743.52 → 1744.48] Luke
[1744.48 → 1745.48] begins
[1745.48 → 1746.14] the story
[1746.14 → 1747.50] by introducing
[1747.50 → 1749.34] not Jesus
[1749.34 → 1749.64] yet
[1749.64 → 1750.06] but he
[1750.06 → 1751.06] introduces
[1751.06 → 1751.82] earlier
[1751.82 → 1752.62] this couple
[1752.62 → 1754.08] Zechariah
[1754.08 → 1754.70] and Elizabeth
[1754.70 → 1755.78] they're living
[1755.78 → 1756.54] out in the
[1756.54 → 1757.10] countryside
[1757.10 → 1757.78] not in
[1757.78 → 1758.20] Jerusalem
[1758.20 → 1760.26] they both
[1760.26 → 1761.26] come from
[1761.26 → 1762.08] the priestly
[1762.08 → 1762.74] line of
[1762.74 → 1763.06] Aaron
[1763.06 → 1763.54] which was
[1763.54 → 1763.98] considered
[1763.98 → 1764.34] to be
[1764.34 → 1764.82] a double
[1764.82 → 1765.22] blessing
[1765.22 → 1766.36] you know
[1766.36 → 1766.94] and Luke
[1766.94 → 1767.72] says that
[1767.72 → 1768.28] they are
[1768.28 → 1768.74] righteous
[1768.74 → 1769.66] before God
[1769.66 → 1770.42] right
[1770.42 → 1770.82] they are
[1770.82 → 1771.22] kind of
[1771.22 → 1772.22] a model
[1772.22 → 1773.26] priestly
[1773.26 → 1773.92] family
[1773.92 → 1775.42] and so
[1775.42 → 1775.74] we have
[1775.74 → 1776.20] this couple
[1776.20 → 1776.82] here who
[1776.82 → 1778.10] loves God
[1778.10 → 1778.94] as we can
[1778.94 → 1779.30] see
[1779.30 → 1780.20] and they
[1780.20 → 1781.14] desire
[1781.14 → 1782.44] to follow
[1782.44 → 1782.82] him
[1782.82 → 1783.16] in their
[1783.16 → 1783.66] lives
[1783.66 → 1785.34] and this
[1785.34 → 1785.64] is what
[1785.64 → 1785.88] makes
[1785.88 → 1786.62] verse 7
[1786.62 → 1787.26] so
[1787.26 → 1787.90] heartbreaking
[1787.90 → 1789.06] because
[1789.06 → 1789.98] Luke tells
[1789.98 → 1790.32] us they
[1790.32 → 1790.86] had no
[1790.86 → 1791.30] child
[1791.30 → 1791.64] because
[1791.64 → 1792.04] Elizabeth
[1792.04 → 1792.36] was
[1792.36 → 1792.70] barren
[1792.70 → 1793.72] and their
[1793.72 → 1794.24] barrenness
[1794.24 → 1794.68] seems to
[1794.68 → 1795.24] be the
[1795.24 → 1795.54] great
[1795.54 → 1796.22] disappointment
[1796.22 → 1797.40] in their
[1797.40 → 1797.92] lives
[1797.92 → 1799.92] but on top
[1799.92 → 1800.24] of this
[1800.24 → 1801.16] very personal
[1801.16 → 1801.80] disappointment
[1801.80 → 1802.38] there's this
[1802.38 → 1803.36] added
[1803.36 → 1804.48] spiritual
[1804.48 → 1805.36] anguish
[1805.36 → 1806.90] and one
[1806.90 → 1807.54] commentator
[1807.54 → 1807.96] says it
[1807.96 → 1808.42] like this
[1808.42 → 1809.88] in any
[1809.88 → 1810.42] culture
[1810.42 → 1811.68] infertility
[1811.68 → 1812.12] is an
[1812.12 → 1812.48] aching
[1812.48 → 1813.02] disappointment
[1813.02 → 1814.24] and for
[1814.24 → 1814.76] some an
[1814.76 → 1815.24] almost
[1815.24 → 1815.92] unbearable
[1815.92 → 1816.42] stress
[1816.42 → 1817.72] but the
[1817.72 → 1817.98] burden
[1817.98 → 1818.62] cannot be
[1818.62 → 1819.04] compared
[1819.04 → 1819.50] to that
[1819.50 → 1820.08] born by
[1820.08 → 1820.68] childless
[1820.68 → 1820.98] women
[1820.98 → 1821.68] in ancient
[1821.68 → 1821.98] Hebrew
[1821.98 → 1822.40] culture
[1822.40 → 1823.34] because
[1823.34 → 1823.92] barrenness
[1823.92 → 1824.66] was considered
[1824.66 → 1825.76] a disgrace
[1825.76 → 1827.48] even a
[1827.48 → 1827.86] punishment
[1827.86 → 1828.42] from God
[1828.42 → 1830.20] and so
[1830.20 → 1830.46] you can
[1830.46 → 1830.80] kind of
[1830.80 → 1831.40] imagine
[1831.40 → 1831.92] perhaps
[1831.92 → 1832.54] the rumour
[1832.54 → 1832.94] mill
[1832.94 → 1833.44] that would
[1833.44 → 1833.72] have been
[1833.72 → 1834.40] going around
[1834.40 → 1834.66] you know
[1834.66 → 1835.22] when people
[1835.22 → 1836.68] in the
[1836.68 → 1837.20] community
[1837.20 → 1837.62] saying
[1837.62 → 1837.98] something
[1837.98 → 1838.40] like
[1838.40 → 1839.06] oh you
[1839.06 → 1839.24] know
[1839.24 → 1840.04] we know
[1840.04 → 1840.74] Zechariah
[1840.74 → 1841.30] and Elizabeth
[1841.30 → 1841.84] and they're
[1841.84 → 1842.48] such great
[1842.48 → 1842.90] people
[1842.90 → 1844.18] they serve
[1844.18 → 1844.76] the Lord
[1844.76 → 1845.22] they're
[1845.22 → 1846.22] blameless
[1846.22 → 1847.68] but they
[1847.68 → 1848.10] don't have
[1848.10 → 1848.72] any children
[1848.72 → 1850.52] so you
[1850.52 → 1850.62] know
[1850.62 → 1851.24] I wonder
[1851.24 → 1851.72] if there's
[1851.72 → 1852.64] something else
[1852.64 → 1853.70] going on
[1853.70 → 1854.66] that we're
[1854.66 → 1855.28] not aware
[1855.28 → 1855.60] of
[1855.60 → 1856.14] that maybe
[1856.14 → 1856.72] God is
[1856.72 → 1857.12] punishing
[1857.12 → 1857.38] them
[1857.38 → 1858.16] for something
[1858.16 → 1858.88] that we
[1858.88 → 1859.48] can't see
[1859.48 → 1861.86] but in
[1861.86 → 1863.06] verse 25
[1863.06 → 1863.70] Elizabeth
[1863.70 → 1864.60] refers to
[1864.60 → 1864.80] her
[1864.80 → 1865.38] barrenness
[1865.38 → 1867.40] as her
[1867.40 → 1867.88] disgrace
[1867.88 → 1868.32] among the
[1868.32 → 1868.66] people
[1868.66 → 1868.88] right
[1868.88 → 1869.22] so kind
[1869.22 → 1869.60] of showing
[1869.60 → 1869.98] that this
[1869.98 → 1870.26] is the
[1870.26 → 1870.60] case
[1870.60 → 1871.80] because people
[1871.80 → 1872.40] assume that
[1872.40 → 1872.90] God was
[1872.90 → 1873.58] punishing her
[1873.58 → 1874.90] but the text
[1874.90 → 1875.68] actually tells
[1875.68 → 1877.20] us that
[1877.20 → 1878.08] Elizabeth was
[1878.08 → 1878.96] righteous before
[1878.96 → 1879.46] God
[1879.46 → 1880.18] right
[1880.18 → 1880.54] well you know
[1880.54 → 1881.18] people can't
[1881.18 → 1881.86] see that
[1881.86 → 1882.84] but Luke
[1882.84 → 1883.32] tells us
[1883.32 → 1883.92] that she
[1883.92 → 1885.30] was righteous
[1885.30 → 1886.06] before God
[1886.06 → 1887.62] so her
[1887.62 → 1888.20] barrenness
[1888.20 → 1888.90] was not
[1888.90 → 1889.50] some kind
[1889.50 → 1890.08] of punishment
[1890.08 → 1890.88] for her sin
[1890.88 → 1891.98] in this
[1891.98 → 1892.84] case it
[1892.84 → 1893.52] was for
[1893.52 → 1894.32] God's
[1894.32 → 1894.68] glory
[1894.68 → 1895.96] for his
[1895.96 → 1896.52] purposes
[1896.52 → 1897.72] in their
[1897.72 → 1898.18] lives
[1898.18 → 1898.74] and for
[1898.74 → 1899.36] the entire
[1899.36 → 1899.84] world
[1899.84 → 1901.56] and friends
[1901.56 → 1901.96] I think
[1901.96 → 1902.52] this is a
[1902.52 → 1903.08] part of
[1903.08 → 1903.62] the longing
[1903.62 → 1904.22] for joy
[1904.22 → 1904.54] that we
[1904.54 → 1905.14] all have
[1905.14 → 1905.86] right
[1905.86 → 1906.26] probably
[1906.26 → 1906.78] all of
[1906.78 → 1907.08] us have
[1907.08 → 1907.76] experienced
[1907.76 → 1908.40] this longing
[1908.40 → 1909.10] for joy
[1909.10 → 1910.10] in the
[1910.10 → 1910.44] midst
[1910.44 → 1911.50] of heartache
[1911.50 → 1912.92] and we
[1912.92 → 1913.54] may even
[1913.54 → 1913.98] wonder
[1913.98 → 1914.36] in the
[1914.36 → 1914.56] midst
[1914.56 → 1915.04] of our
[1915.04 → 1915.54] the
[1915.54 → 1916.36] barrenness
[1916.36 → 1916.72] that we
[1916.72 → 1917.36] experience
[1917.36 → 1917.86] in different
[1917.86 → 1918.36] ways
[1918.36 → 1919.08] we
[1919.08 → 1919.44] wonder
[1919.44 → 1920.34] is God
[1920.34 → 1920.76] punishing
[1920.76 → 1921.02] me
[1921.02 → 1922.50] you know
[1922.50 → 1923.10] maybe like
[1923.10 → 1923.52] Zechariah
[1923.52 → 1924.02] and Elizabeth
[1924.02 → 1924.78] you would
[1924.78 → 1925.04] like to
[1925.04 → 1925.30] have a
[1925.30 → 1925.68] child
[1925.68 → 1926.96] or maybe
[1926.96 → 1927.24] you're
[1927.24 → 1927.58] struggling
[1927.58 → 1928.04] with a
[1928.04 → 1928.36] painful
[1928.36 → 1929.10] relationship
[1929.10 → 1929.50] and you
[1929.50 → 1929.92] just wonder
[1929.92 → 1930.52] like why
[1930.52 → 1931.08] you know
[1931.08 → 1931.44] is this
[1931.44 → 1931.84] happening
[1931.84 → 1932.14] this is
[1932.14 → 1932.70] so hard
[1932.70 → 1934.42] or you're
[1934.42 → 1934.94] wishing maybe
[1934.94 → 1935.42] that God
[1935.42 → 1935.84] would bring
[1935.84 → 1936.22] someone
[1936.22 → 1936.80] into your
[1936.80 → 1937.30] life
[1937.30 → 1938.02] like a
[1938.02 → 1938.44] friend
[1938.44 → 1939.30] or a
[1939.30 → 1939.74] spouse
[1939.74 → 1941.50] or you're
[1941.50 → 1941.90] waiting for
[1941.90 → 1942.36] a job
[1942.36 → 1942.58] you know
[1942.58 → 1942.98] we all
[1942.98 → 1943.22] you know
[1943.22 → 1943.70] experience
[1943.70 → 1945.80] these longings
[1945.80 → 1946.52] that joy
[1946.52 → 1947.02] would come
[1947.02 → 1947.46] to us
[1947.46 → 1947.68] and we
[1947.68 → 1948.12] feel the
[1948.12 → 1948.58] barrenness
[1948.58 → 1948.98] of it
[1948.98 → 1950.56] and the
[1950.56 → 1951.08] question I
[1951.08 → 1951.50] think God
[1951.50 → 1951.86] would have
[1951.86 → 1952.58] us ask
[1952.58 → 1953.26] as we
[1953.26 → 1953.70] wait
[1953.70 → 1954.10] and as
[1954.10 → 1954.86] we long
[1954.86 → 1956.18] for joy
[1956.18 → 1957.58] is not
[1957.58 → 1958.44] you know
[1958.44 → 1958.94] what have
[1958.94 → 1959.42] I'm done
[1959.42 → 1960.06] to deserve
[1960.06 → 1960.62] this
[1960.62 → 1961.80] you know
[1961.80 → 1962.12] that's the
[1962.12 → 1962.72] question we
[1962.72 → 1963.56] instinctively
[1963.56 → 1964.00] ask
[1964.00 → 1966.04] but instead
[1966.04 → 1966.62] what if we
[1966.62 → 1967.12] asked
[1967.12 → 1968.32] God how
[1968.32 → 1968.64] can I
[1968.64 → 1969.54] glorify you
[1969.54 → 1971.22] in the
[1971.22 → 1971.66] midst of
[1971.66 → 1971.98] this
[1971.98 → 1973.44] and I
[1973.44 → 1974.22] say that
[1974.22 → 1974.62] because I
[1974.62 → 1975.24] think Elizabeth
[1975.24 → 1976.16] is such a
[1976.16 → 1976.92] beautiful example
[1976.92 → 1977.48] of this
[1977.48 → 1978.70] right she
[1978.70 → 1979.22] didn't
[1979.22 → 1980.50] wait for a
[1980.50 → 1981.34] child before
[1981.34 → 1981.76] she could
[1981.76 → 1982.14] live her
[1982.14 → 1982.50] life
[1982.50 → 1983.28] it didn't
[1983.28 → 1983.90] stop her
[1983.90 → 1984.32] from being
[1984.32 → 1985.06] committed to
[1985.06 → 1985.78] walking with
[1985.78 → 1986.16] God
[1986.16 → 1987.42] blamelessly
[1987.42 → 1988.44] you know
[1988.44 → 1989.00] and I think
[1989.00 → 1989.66] that's just
[1989.66 → 1990.72] as I looked
[1990.72 → 1991.46] at this story
[1991.46 → 1991.96] this week
[1991.96 → 1992.54] I think
[1992.54 → 1992.86] it's so
[1992.86 → 1993.46] inspiring
[1993.46 → 1994.74] you know
[1994.74 → 1995.16] that even
[1995.16 → 1995.76] in the midst
[1995.76 → 1996.16] of this
[1996.16 → 1996.56] pain
[1996.56 → 1997.70] that they
[1997.70 → 1998.28] were just
[1998.28 → 1998.88] faithful
[1998.88 → 1999.80] to trying
[1999.80 → 2000.32] to follow
[2000.32 → 2000.76] God
[2000.76 → 2001.20] and to
[2001.20 → 2001.66] glorify
[2001.66 → 2001.92] him
[2001.92 → 2002.44] in their
[2002.44 → 2002.90] lives
[2002.90 → 2004.68] and so
[2004.68 → 2005.16] that's
[2005.16 → 2005.58] Elizabeth
[2005.58 → 2006.38] and Zechariah
[2006.38 → 2007.80] so now
[2007.80 → 2008.34] let's continue
[2008.34 → 2008.68] to read
[2008.68 → 2009.26] in the story
[2009.26 → 2009.84] and we'll
[2009.84 → 2010.40] read verses
[2010.40 → 2011.00] 8 to 10
[2011.00 → 2013.66] so it goes
[2013.66 → 2013.90] on
[2013.90 → 2014.54] once when
[2014.54 → 2015.14] Zechariah's
[2015.14 → 2015.54] division
[2015.54 → 2016.10] was on
[2016.10 → 2016.46] duty
[2016.46 → 2017.08] and he
[2017.08 → 2017.56] was serving
[2017.56 → 2018.16] as priest
[2018.16 → 2018.92] before God
[2018.92 → 2019.80] he was
[2019.80 → 2020.42] chosen by
[2020.42 → 2020.80] lot
[2020.80 → 2021.96] according to
[2021.96 → 2022.50] the custom
[2022.50 → 2022.96] of the
[2022.96 → 2023.46] priesthood
[2023.46 → 2024.26] to go
[2024.26 → 2024.70] into the
[2024.70 → 2024.96] temple
[2024.96 → 2025.32] of the
[2025.32 → 2025.62] Lord
[2025.62 → 2026.56] and burn
[2026.56 → 2027.08] incense
[2027.08 → 2029.22] and when
[2029.22 → 2029.76] the time
[2029.76 → 2030.06] for the
[2030.06 → 2030.32] burning
[2030.32 → 2030.88] of incense
[2030.88 → 2031.54] came
[2031.54 → 2032.60] all the
[2032.60 → 2033.04] assembled
[2033.04 → 2033.70] worshippers
[2033.70 → 2034.96] were praying
[2034.96 → 2035.64] outside
[2035.64 → 2038.76] all right
[2038.76 → 2039.04] and so
[2039.04 → 2039.44] in verse
[2039.44 → 2039.96] 8
[2039.96 → 2040.60] Luke
[2040.60 → 2041.68] excuse me
[2041.68 → 2042.02] Luke
[2042.02 → 2043.16] zooms
[2043.16 → 2044.34] out from
[2044.34 → 2044.90] Zechariah
[2044.90 → 2045.40] and Elizabeth
[2045.40 → 2046.28] and then
[2046.28 → 2047.04] he takes us
[2047.04 → 2047.68] somewhere else
[2047.68 → 2048.42] suddenly we're
[2048.42 → 2049.02] in Jerusalem
[2049.02 → 2050.98] and we're
[2050.98 → 2051.30] at the
[2051.30 → 2051.80] temple
[2051.80 → 2052.70] and the
[2052.70 → 2053.34] temple was
[2053.34 → 2054.02] the centre
[2054.02 → 2054.90] of activity
[2054.90 → 2055.46] for the
[2055.46 → 2056.14] people of
[2056.14 → 2056.62] God
[2056.62 → 2057.52] in that
[2057.52 → 2057.86] day
[2057.86 → 2059.06] and Luke
[2059.06 → 2059.98] makes this
[2059.98 → 2060.56] shift
[2060.56 → 2061.56] because
[2061.56 → 2062.46] the
[2062.46 → 2063.50] barrenness
[2063.50 → 2063.96] of the
[2063.96 → 2064.86] circumstances
[2064.86 → 2065.54] of Elizabeth
[2065.54 → 2066.56] and Zechariah
[2066.56 → 2067.74] in a sense
[2067.74 → 2068.66] is a reflection
[2068.66 → 2069.82] of a
[2069.82 → 2070.34] different
[2070.34 → 2071.16] barrenness
[2071.16 → 2072.06] that's going
[2072.06 → 2072.82] on in the
[2072.82 → 2073.18] world
[2073.18 → 2074.30] it's the
[2074.30 → 2074.84] barrenness
[2074.84 → 2075.52] that's happening
[2075.52 → 2075.96] for the
[2075.96 → 2076.46] people of
[2076.46 → 2076.80] God
[2076.80 → 2078.54] so in
[2078.54 → 2079.04] ancient
[2079.04 → 2079.72] Judaism
[2079.72 → 2081.20] the temple
[2081.20 → 2082.44] was the
[2082.44 → 2082.92] place where
[2082.92 → 2083.34] heaven
[2083.34 → 2084.52] and earth
[2084.52 → 2085.08] met
[2085.08 → 2085.96] it was
[2085.96 → 2086.50] the place
[2086.50 → 2086.80] where
[2086.80 → 2087.74] the people
[2087.74 → 2088.12] and the
[2088.12 → 2088.48] priests
[2088.48 → 2088.98] would go
[2088.98 → 2089.70] to work
[2089.70 → 2090.22] out their
[2090.22 → 2090.94] relationship
[2090.94 → 2092.18] with God
[2092.18 → 2093.66] so they
[2093.66 → 2094.10] would go
[2094.10 → 2094.50] to the
[2094.50 → 2094.86] temple
[2094.86 → 2096.32] where God's
[2096.32 → 2096.88] presence
[2096.88 → 2097.76] especially
[2097.76 → 2098.26] dwelt
[2098.26 → 2098.88] and they
[2098.88 → 2099.24] would go
[2099.24 → 2099.44] and they
[2099.44 → 2099.78] would offer
[2099.78 → 2100.34] prayers
[2100.34 → 2100.96] for forgiveness
[2100.96 → 2102.28] and they
[2102.28 → 2102.70] would pray
[2102.70 → 2103.34] for God
[2103.34 → 2104.74] to finally
[2104.74 → 2105.48] send
[2105.48 → 2106.50] the promised
[2106.50 → 2107.14] Messiah
[2107.14 → 2108.38] to finally
[2108.38 → 2109.00] send this
[2109.00 → 2109.64] king
[2109.64 → 2111.26] that the
[2111.26 → 2111.66] prophets
[2111.66 → 2112.76] had foretold
[2112.76 → 2113.08] who would
[2113.08 → 2113.68] come and
[2113.68 → 2114.32] would reign
[2114.32 → 2115.58] and establish
[2115.58 → 2116.14] his everlasting
[2116.14 → 2116.56] kingdom
[2116.56 → 2119.14] but the
[2119.14 → 2119.80] people of
[2119.80 → 2120.36] God
[2120.36 → 2121.80] have only
[2121.80 → 2122.32] known
[2122.32 → 2122.90] silence
[2122.90 → 2123.44] for hundreds
[2123.44 → 2124.02] of years
[2124.02 → 2125.46] for 400
[2125.46 → 2126.38] years
[2126.38 → 2127.54] that's a
[2127.54 → 2128.22] long time
[2128.22 → 2129.04] 400 years
[2129.04 → 2129.54] they hadn't
[2129.54 → 2129.94] heard God
[2129.94 → 2130.36] speak
[2130.36 → 2132.58] there hadn't
[2132.58 → 2133.12] been any
[2133.12 → 2134.04] true prophets
[2134.04 → 2135.56] there had
[2135.56 → 2136.16] been no
[2136.16 → 2136.78] fulfillment
[2136.78 → 2137.98] of promise
[2137.98 → 2138.42] all of
[2138.42 → 2139.50] all of what
[2139.50 → 2140.12] they believed
[2140.12 → 2140.72] was becoming
[2140.72 → 2141.48] more and more
[2141.48 → 2142.46] these old
[2142.46 → 2143.26] stories that
[2143.26 → 2143.70] were passed
[2143.70 → 2144.18] down to
[2144.18 → 2144.52] them not
[2144.52 → 2145.02] something that
[2145.02 → 2145.30] they were
[2145.30 → 2146.06] experiencing
[2146.06 → 2147.38] in their
[2147.38 → 2147.72] day
[2147.72 → 2149.06] it was a
[2149.06 → 2149.66] barren
[2149.66 → 2150.52] time
[2150.52 → 2151.44] for God's
[2151.44 → 2151.76] people
[2151.76 → 2154.48] and so in
[2154.48 → 2155.20] verse 8
[2155.20 → 2156.46] we join
[2156.46 → 2157.26] Zechariah at
[2157.26 → 2157.64] the temple
[2157.64 → 2159.66] in Zechariah's
[2159.66 → 2160.14] day the
[2160.14 → 2160.86] priests of
[2160.86 → 2161.64] Israel were
[2161.64 → 2162.30] organized
[2162.30 → 2163.58] into 24
[2163.58 → 2164.30] divisions
[2164.30 → 2164.98] and each
[2164.98 → 2166.02] division served
[2166.02 → 2166.50] at the temple
[2166.50 → 2167.28] for two weeks
[2167.28 → 2168.78] so Zechariah
[2168.78 → 2169.34] was at the
[2169.34 → 2169.82] temple in
[2169.82 → 2170.20] Jerusalem
[2170.20 → 2171.02] kind of doing
[2171.02 → 2171.68] his priestly
[2171.68 → 2172.20] duty
[2172.20 → 2173.14] going you know
[2173.14 → 2173.58] moving from
[2173.58 → 2173.96] his home
[2173.96 → 2174.38] going to
[2174.38 → 2174.66] work
[2174.66 → 2175.02] at the
[2175.02 → 2175.30] temple
[2175.30 → 2176.36] and he
[2176.36 → 2176.90] was serving
[2176.90 → 2177.24] with the
[2177.24 → 2177.48] other
[2177.48 → 2177.90] priests
[2177.90 → 2178.20] in his
[2178.20 → 2178.62] division
[2178.62 → 2180.34] and every
[2180.34 → 2181.66] day a
[2181.66 → 2182.68] priest went
[2182.68 → 2183.32] into the
[2183.32 → 2184.12] holy place
[2184.12 → 2184.64] inside the
[2184.64 → 2185.60] temple to
[2185.60 → 2186.42] burn incense
[2186.42 → 2187.82] the symbol
[2187.82 → 2189.12] of the prayers
[2189.12 → 2189.86] and praises
[2189.86 → 2191.24] of Israel
[2191.24 → 2192.16] to Yahweh
[2192.16 → 2194.26] but since
[2194.26 → 2194.74] there were so
[2194.74 → 2195.66] many priests
[2195.66 → 2196.80] the choice
[2196.80 → 2197.36] of who would
[2197.36 → 2198.28] get to go
[2198.28 → 2199.88] was done
[2199.88 → 2200.50] by casting
[2200.50 → 2200.94] lots
[2200.94 → 2202.12] and verse
[2202.12 → 2202.70] 9 tells
[2202.70 → 2203.06] us
[2203.06 → 2204.04] that it
[2204.04 → 2204.52] finally
[2204.52 → 2204.90] landed
[2204.90 → 2205.66] on Zechariah
[2205.66 → 2207.34] and so
[2207.34 → 2208.08] he was
[2208.08 → 2208.50] the one
[2208.50 → 2208.92] chosen
[2208.92 → 2209.34] who would
[2209.34 → 2209.96] go into
[2209.96 → 2210.44] the temple
[2210.44 → 2211.00] into the
[2211.00 → 2211.76] holy place
[2211.76 → 2212.78] and to
[2212.78 → 2213.04] lay the
[2213.04 → 2213.32] incense
[2213.32 → 2213.62] and so
[2213.62 → 2213.94] this was
[2213.94 → 2214.30] a big
[2214.30 → 2214.62] deal
[2214.62 → 2215.46] like we
[2215.46 → 2215.86] don't even
[2215.86 → 2216.80] know how
[2216.80 → 2218.30] many times
[2218.30 → 2219.12] Zechariah
[2219.12 → 2219.42] would get
[2219.42 → 2219.72] to do
[2219.72 → 2220.24] this in
[2220.24 → 2221.12] his career
[2221.12 → 2221.44] as a
[2221.44 → 2221.74] priest
[2221.74 → 2223.50] and we're
[2223.50 → 2223.90] told in
[2223.90 → 2224.38] verse 10
[2224.38 → 2224.84] that as
[2224.84 → 2225.26] Zechariah
[2225.26 → 2225.78] enters the
[2225.78 → 2226.28] temple the
[2226.28 → 2226.76] people are
[2226.76 → 2227.52] all gathered
[2227.52 → 2228.44] outside
[2228.44 → 2229.54] praying
[2229.54 → 2231.64] so Zechariah
[2231.64 → 2232.12] makes his
[2232.12 → 2233.00] way into
[2233.00 → 2233.54] the temple
[2233.54 → 2234.78] to burn
[2234.78 → 2235.30] incense
[2235.30 → 2235.94] representing
[2235.94 → 2236.52] the prayers
[2236.52 → 2236.96] of all
[2236.96 → 2237.48] the people
[2237.48 → 2238.08] outside
[2238.08 → 2239.00] that God
[2239.00 → 2239.50] would hear
[2239.50 → 2239.88] them
[2239.88 → 2240.58] and that God
[2240.58 → 2241.16] would show
[2241.16 → 2242.30] up in
[2242.30 → 2243.22] the barrenness
[2243.22 → 2244.10] of the world
[2244.10 → 2246.26] and so
[2246.26 → 2246.76] brothers and
[2246.76 → 2247.24] sisters as
[2247.24 → 2247.74] we read a
[2247.74 → 2248.28] story like
[2248.28 → 2248.74] this I
[2248.74 → 2249.08] think it's
[2249.08 → 2249.52] good for
[2249.52 → 2249.76] us to
[2249.76 → 2250.16] use our
[2250.16 → 2251.00] imaginations
[2251.00 → 2251.82] and to
[2251.82 → 2252.52] enter into
[2252.52 → 2253.20] the story
[2253.20 → 2254.94] so picture
[2254.94 → 2255.38] it with
[2255.38 → 2255.64] me
[2255.64 → 2257.94] in the
[2257.94 → 2258.50] temple it
[2258.50 → 2258.78] would be
[2258.78 → 2259.14] dim
[2259.14 → 2261.34] lit by
[2261.34 → 2261.98] the candle
[2261.98 → 2262.60] light of
[2262.60 → 2263.14] the holy
[2263.14 → 2263.92] lamp stand
[2263.92 → 2265.42] that seven
[2265.42 → 2265.80] headed
[2265.80 → 2266.72] candlestick
[2266.72 → 2267.60] that Moses
[2267.60 → 2268.54] was told to
[2268.54 → 2269.00] put in the
[2269.00 → 2269.52] tabernacle
[2269.52 → 2271.20] and it
[2271.20 → 2271.46] would be
[2271.46 → 2271.86] quiet
[2271.86 → 2273.80] out of the
[2273.80 → 2274.42] heat and
[2274.42 → 2275.08] away from
[2275.08 → 2275.70] the noise
[2275.70 → 2276.04] of the
[2276.04 → 2276.68] busy temple
[2276.68 → 2277.72] area outside
[2277.72 → 2279.54] away from
[2279.54 → 2279.84] all the
[2279.84 → 2281.06] people who
[2281.06 → 2281.58] wanted to
[2281.58 → 2281.96] be in
[2281.96 → 2282.42] there were
[2282.42 → 2283.14] God was
[2283.14 → 2284.72] and away
[2284.72 → 2285.08] from all
[2285.08 → 2285.88] the animals
[2285.88 → 2286.58] that didn't
[2286.58 → 2286.84] want to
[2286.84 → 2287.24] be there
[2287.24 → 2289.52] there would
[2289.52 → 2290.06] be a
[2290.06 → 2290.92] strong
[2290.92 → 2292.64] smell of
[2292.64 → 2293.44] pungent
[2293.44 → 2294.02] incense
[2294.02 → 2295.56] because it
[2295.56 → 2296.08] was burned
[2296.08 → 2297.26] here on
[2297.26 → 2297.80] the altar
[2297.80 → 2299.62] every day
[2299.62 → 2300.92] of every
[2300.92 → 2301.50] year
[2301.50 → 2303.20] and you
[2303.20 → 2303.86] would remember
[2303.86 → 2305.18] as a priest
[2305.18 → 2305.64] going into
[2305.64 → 2306.04] the temple
[2306.04 → 2306.82] the stories
[2306.82 → 2307.32] of how
[2307.32 → 2308.30] people had
[2308.30 → 2309.66] died who
[2309.66 → 2310.36] didn't show
[2310.36 → 2310.84] the proper
[2310.84 → 2312.22] respect in
[2312.22 → 2312.94] carrying out
[2312.94 → 2313.68] these duties
[2313.68 → 2316.42] so let's
[2316.42 → 2316.86] read what
[2316.86 → 2317.40] happens
[2317.40 → 2318.50] next
[2318.50 → 2320.02] in verses
[2320.02 → 2320.54] 11 to
[2320.54 → 2321.02] 17
[2321.02 → 2321.72] then an
[2321.72 → 2322.28] angel of
[2322.28 → 2322.80] the Lord
[2322.80 → 2323.92] appeared to
[2323.92 → 2324.18] him
[2324.18 → 2325.98] standing at
[2325.98 → 2326.36] the right
[2326.36 → 2326.94] side of
[2326.94 → 2327.36] the altar
[2327.36 → 2328.12] of incense
[2328.12 → 2329.30] when Zechariah
[2329.30 → 2329.84] saw him
[2329.84 → 2330.14] he was
[2330.14 → 2330.60] startled
[2330.60 → 2331.44] and was
[2331.44 → 2331.92] gripped
[2331.92 → 2332.58] with fear
[2332.58 → 2334.80] but the
[2334.80 → 2335.28] angel said
[2335.28 → 2335.62] to him
[2335.62 → 2336.02] do not
[2336.02 → 2336.48] be afraid
[2336.48 → 2337.10] Zechariah
[2337.10 → 2338.18] your prayer
[2338.18 → 2338.68] has been
[2338.68 → 2339.00] heard
[2339.00 → 2339.76] your wife
[2339.76 → 2340.18] Elizabeth
[2340.18 → 2340.82] will bear
[2340.82 → 2341.96] you a son
[2341.96 → 2342.52] and you
[2342.52 → 2342.80] are to
[2342.80 → 2343.24] call him
[2343.24 → 2343.64] John
[2343.64 → 2344.54] he will
[2344.54 → 2345.24] be a joy
[2345.24 → 2346.64] and delight
[2346.64 → 2347.28] to you
[2347.28 → 2348.08] and many
[2348.08 → 2348.80] will rejoice
[2348.80 → 2349.40] because of
[2349.40 → 2349.94] his birth
[2349.94 → 2351.94] for he
[2351.94 → 2352.28] will be
[2352.28 → 2352.96] great in
[2352.96 → 2353.42] the sight
[2353.42 → 2353.74] of the
[2353.74 → 2354.04] Lord
[2354.04 → 2354.84] he is
[2354.84 → 2355.28] never to
[2355.28 → 2355.90] take wine
[2355.90 → 2356.34] or other
[2356.34 → 2356.72] fermented
[2356.72 → 2357.20] drink
[2357.20 → 2357.92] and he
[2357.92 → 2358.24] will be
[2358.24 → 2358.58] filled
[2358.58 → 2358.88] with the
[2358.88 → 2359.54] Holy Spirit
[2359.54 → 2360.42] even before
[2360.42 → 2360.76] he is
[2360.76 → 2361.06] born
[2361.06 → 2362.10] he will
[2362.10 → 2362.72] bring back
[2362.72 → 2363.30] many of
[2363.30 → 2363.66] the people
[2363.66 → 2364.18] of Israel
[2364.18 → 2365.06] to the
[2365.06 → 2365.36] Lord
[2365.36 → 2366.06] their God
[2366.06 → 2368.26] and he
[2368.26 → 2368.70] will go
[2368.70 → 2369.32] on before
[2369.32 → 2370.46] the Lord
[2370.46 → 2371.42] in the
[2371.42 → 2371.74] spirit
[2371.74 → 2372.26] and power
[2372.26 → 2372.92] of Elijah
[2372.92 → 2373.70] to turn
[2373.70 → 2374.20] the hearts
[2374.20 → 2374.48] of the
[2374.48 → 2374.84] parents
[2374.84 → 2375.16] to their
[2375.16 → 2375.56] children
[2375.56 → 2376.18] and the
[2376.18 → 2376.82] disobedient
[2376.82 → 2377.18] to the
[2377.18 → 2377.42] wisdom
[2377.42 → 2377.72] of the
[2377.72 → 2377.98] righteous
[2377.98 → 2378.86] to make
[2378.86 → 2379.30] ready
[2379.30 → 2379.86] a people
[2379.86 → 2380.44] prepared
[2380.44 → 2381.30] for the
[2381.30 → 2381.58] Lord
[2381.58 → 2387.46] so as
[2387.46 → 2388.04] Zechariah
[2388.04 → 2388.84] is standing
[2388.84 → 2390.02] in that
[2390.02 → 2390.86] holy place
[2390.86 → 2391.40] the place
[2391.40 → 2391.82] where
[2391.82 → 2393.00] God
[2393.00 → 2393.74] dwells
[2393.74 → 2394.70] the place
[2394.70 → 2395.16] that is so
[2395.16 → 2395.66] sacred
[2395.66 → 2396.42] and holy
[2396.42 → 2397.20] and where
[2397.20 → 2397.68] people
[2397.68 → 2398.60] have gotten
[2398.60 → 2399.38] things wrong
[2399.38 → 2400.70] suddenly
[2400.70 → 2401.82] Gabriel
[2401.82 → 2402.58] is there
[2402.58 → 2403.68] standing
[2403.68 → 2404.42] next to
[2404.42 → 2404.82] the altar
[2404.82 → 2405.48] of incense
[2405.48 → 2406.78] the name
[2406.78 → 2407.30] means
[2407.30 → 2407.66] God
[2407.66 → 2408.02] is my
[2408.02 → 2408.58] strength
[2408.58 → 2410.56] of course
[2410.56 → 2411.06] even a
[2411.06 → 2411.60] good priest
[2411.60 → 2412.30] like Zechariah
[2412.30 → 2413.08] is frightened
[2413.08 → 2414.20] by such
[2414.20 → 2414.86] a creature
[2414.86 → 2416.82] you've never
[2416.82 → 2417.22] seen an
[2417.22 → 2417.82] angel before
[2417.82 → 2419.24] you've never
[2419.24 → 2419.78] talked to
[2419.78 → 2420.22] anyone
[2420.22 → 2421.02] who has
[2421.02 → 2421.54] seen an
[2421.54 → 2421.78] angel
[2421.78 → 2422.20] before
[2422.20 → 2423.62] but you've
[2423.62 → 2424.02] read about
[2424.02 → 2424.24] them
[2424.24 → 2425.64] and
[2425.64 → 2426.20] actually
[2426.20 → 2427.22] standing
[2427.22 → 2427.48] there in
[2427.48 → 2427.78] the holy
[2427.78 → 2428.34] place
[2428.34 → 2428.98] there's a
[2428.98 → 2429.26] curtain
[2429.26 → 2429.88] right next
[2429.88 → 2430.32] to you
[2430.32 → 2431.18] separating
[2431.18 → 2432.06] the most
[2432.06 → 2432.82] holy place
[2432.82 → 2433.44] where there's
[2433.44 → 2433.82] the ark
[2433.82 → 2434.08] of the
[2434.08 → 2434.38] covenant
[2434.38 → 2435.04] and there
[2435.04 → 2435.44] are two
[2435.44 → 2436.12] statues
[2436.12 → 2436.74] depicting
[2436.74 → 2437.40] such
[2437.40 → 2438.08] creatures
[2438.08 → 2439.48] right there
[2439.48 → 2440.78] and here
[2440.78 → 2441.42] is one
[2441.42 → 2441.96] a real
[2441.96 → 2442.38] one
[2442.38 → 2443.46] standing
[2443.46 → 2444.52] right next
[2444.52 → 2444.86] to you
[2444.86 → 2447.58] the angel
[2447.58 → 2448.08] has been
[2448.08 → 2448.44] sent
[2448.44 → 2448.76] as a
[2448.76 → 2449.14] messenger
[2449.14 → 2449.88] and that
[2449.88 → 2450.48] makes sense
[2450.48 → 2450.98] because the
[2450.98 → 2451.60] word angel
[2451.60 → 2452.90] means messenger
[2452.90 → 2454.48] and his
[2454.48 → 2455.48] message is an
[2455.48 → 2455.92] announcement
[2455.92 → 2456.70] it's a good
[2456.70 → 2457.16] announcement
[2457.16 → 2458.48] the angel
[2458.48 → 2459.04] says
[2459.04 → 2459.78] do not be
[2459.78 → 2460.08] afraid
[2460.08 → 2460.66] Zechariah
[2460.66 → 2461.18] your prayer
[2461.18 → 2461.54] has been
[2461.54 → 2461.92] heard
[2461.92 → 2462.88] your wife
[2462.88 → 2463.28] Elizabeth
[2463.28 → 2463.78] will bear
[2463.78 → 2464.16] you a
[2464.16 → 2464.44] son
[2464.44 → 2465.22] and you
[2465.22 → 2465.50] are to
[2465.50 → 2465.88] give him
[2465.88 → 2466.26] the name
[2466.26 → 2466.66] John
[2466.66 → 2468.96] the angel
[2468.96 → 2469.56] says
[2469.56 → 2470.44] that there
[2470.44 → 2470.86] will be
[2470.86 → 2471.38] a child
[2471.38 → 2472.70] and you
[2472.70 → 2472.98] and your
[2472.98 → 2473.32] wife
[2473.32 → 2473.82] have asked
[2473.82 → 2474.08] for this
[2474.08 → 2474.46] gift
[2474.46 → 2475.64] many times
[2475.64 → 2477.08] but you
[2477.08 → 2477.50] had given
[2477.50 → 2478.14] up hope
[2478.14 → 2479.02] because it
[2479.02 → 2479.64] no longer
[2479.64 → 2480.04] seemed
[2480.04 → 2480.64] possible
[2480.64 → 2482.88] the name
[2482.88 → 2483.52] John
[2483.52 → 2484.40] means
[2484.40 → 2484.98] God has
[2484.98 → 2485.12] been
[2485.12 → 2485.48] gracious
[2485.48 → 2487.30] God
[2487.30 → 2488.14] has answered
[2488.14 → 2488.78] Zechariah
[2488.78 → 2489.48] and Elizabeth's
[2489.48 → 2490.12] prayer for a
[2490.12 → 2490.38] child
[2490.38 → 2490.98] God has
[2490.98 → 2491.28] been
[2491.28 → 2492.08] gracious
[2492.08 → 2493.24] to them
[2493.24 → 2494.92] but this
[2494.92 → 2495.48] child is
[2495.48 → 2496.00] not only
[2496.00 → 2496.54] an answer
[2496.54 → 2497.60] to Zechariah
[2497.60 → 2498.24] and Elizabeth's
[2498.24 → 2498.48] prayer
[2498.48 → 2499.48] because through
[2499.48 → 2500.06] this child
[2500.06 → 2500.64] God is going
[2500.64 → 2501.08] to answer
[2501.08 → 2501.72] the prayers
[2501.72 → 2503.32] of Israel
[2503.32 → 2504.62] of all
[2504.62 → 2504.94] of his
[2504.94 → 2505.34] people
[2505.34 → 2506.44] the angel
[2506.44 → 2506.94] says
[2506.94 → 2507.72] your son
[2507.72 → 2508.14] will be
[2508.14 → 2508.70] the one
[2508.70 → 2509.62] who prepares
[2509.62 → 2510.26] the way
[2510.26 → 2510.80] for the
[2510.80 → 2511.30] Messiah
[2511.30 → 2511.80] to come
[2511.80 → 2512.34] the long
[2512.34 → 2513.14] awaited
[2513.14 → 2513.68] Messiah
[2513.68 → 2514.82] is getting
[2514.82 → 2515.34] ready to
[2515.34 → 2515.62] come
[2515.62 → 2517.28] the waiting
[2517.28 → 2517.64] is about
[2517.64 → 2518.10] to end
[2518.10 → 2519.78] the angel
[2519.78 → 2520.58] even says
[2520.58 → 2521.64] he will be
[2521.64 → 2522.36] a joy
[2522.36 → 2523.84] and delight
[2523.84 → 2524.46] to you
[2524.46 → 2525.12] and many
[2525.12 → 2525.84] will rejoice
[2525.84 → 2527.00] because of
[2527.00 → 2527.54] his birth
[2527.54 → 2528.46] right
[2528.46 → 2529.02] the child
[2529.02 → 2529.50] is to be
[2529.50 → 2530.12] the fulfillment
[2530.12 → 2530.76] of joy
[2530.76 → 2531.18] that the
[2531.18 → 2531.58] world
[2531.58 → 2532.28] has been
[2532.28 → 2532.68] longing
[2532.68 → 2533.12] for
[2533.12 → 2535.66] you know
[2535.66 → 2536.16] and when we
[2536.16 → 2536.94] think about
[2536.94 → 2538.02] this answer
[2538.02 → 2539.10] to Zechariah
[2539.10 → 2539.74] and Elizabeth's
[2539.74 → 2540.00] prayer
[2540.00 → 2541.42] you know
[2541.42 → 2542.42] God hears
[2542.42 → 2543.60] all of our
[2543.60 → 2544.24] prayers too
[2544.24 → 2546.62] Peter in one
[2546.62 → 2547.26] of his letters
[2547.26 → 2548.36] says to the
[2548.36 → 2548.78] church
[2548.78 → 2549.92] he says
[2549.92 → 2551.04] humble yourselves
[2551.04 → 2551.98] therefore under
[2551.98 → 2552.82] the mighty hand
[2552.82 → 2553.36] of God
[2553.36 → 2554.48] so that at the
[2554.48 → 2555.28] proper time
[2555.28 → 2556.04] he may exalt
[2556.04 → 2556.32] you
[2556.32 → 2557.92] casting all of
[2557.92 → 2558.58] your anxieties
[2558.58 → 2559.04] on him
[2559.04 → 2559.76] casting all
[2559.76 → 2559.96] of your
[2559.96 → 2560.62] burdens
[2560.62 → 2561.34] all of
[2561.34 → 2561.48] your
[2561.48 → 2562.14] barrenness
[2562.14 → 2562.72] on him
[2562.72 → 2563.98] because he
[2563.98 → 2564.44] cares for
[2564.44 → 2564.72] you
[2564.72 → 2566.74] and so
[2566.74 → 2567.00] you know
[2567.00 → 2567.56] whether it's
[2567.56 → 2568.10] the prayers
[2568.10 → 2568.98] that in
[2568.98 → 2569.76] our hearts
[2569.76 → 2570.90] in our
[2570.90 → 2571.44] homes
[2571.44 → 2571.82] that we
[2571.82 → 2572.18] make in
[2572.18 → 2572.54] private
[2572.54 → 2574.44] or whether
[2574.44 → 2574.96] it's the
[2574.96 → 2575.36] prayers
[2575.36 → 2576.04] that maybe
[2576.04 → 2577.14] as a
[2577.14 → 2577.52] community
[2577.52 → 2578.04] we say
[2578.04 → 2578.56] together
[2578.56 → 2580.10] you know
[2580.10 → 2580.36] whether
[2580.36 → 2580.84] they're
[2580.84 → 2581.50] small
[2581.50 → 2582.66] or whether
[2582.66 → 2584.04] they seem
[2584.04 → 2585.76] so significant
[2585.76 → 2586.36] as to carry
[2586.36 → 2586.68] the weight
[2586.68 → 2586.92] of the
[2586.92 → 2587.28] world
[2587.28 → 2588.38] right
[2588.38 → 2588.66] God
[2588.66 → 2589.12] hears
[2589.12 → 2589.48] all of
[2589.48 → 2589.68] them
[2589.68 → 2590.78] and we
[2590.78 → 2591.32] can cast
[2591.32 → 2592.00] all of
[2592.00 → 2592.16] them
[2592.16 → 2592.72] on God
[2592.72 → 2595.08] in our
[2595.08 → 2595.48] prayers
[2595.48 → 2595.78] in the
[2595.78 → 2595.98] midst
[2595.98 → 2596.12] of
[2596.12 → 2596.76] situations
[2596.76 → 2597.56] that
[2597.56 → 2598.04] seem
[2598.04 → 2598.40] hopeless
[2598.40 → 2598.96] and seem
[2598.96 → 2599.30] barren
[2599.30 → 2599.74] to us
[2599.74 → 2600.32] God
[2600.32 → 2600.62] hears
[2600.62 → 2600.82] those
[2600.82 → 2601.18] prayers
[2601.18 → 2602.20] right
[2602.20 → 2602.48] he
[2602.48 → 2603.18] knows
[2603.18 → 2603.54] them
[2603.54 → 2603.74] he
[2603.74 → 2604.26] knows
[2604.26 → 2604.54] the
[2604.54 → 2605.34] longings
[2605.34 → 2605.76] and the
[2605.76 → 2606.22] desires
[2606.22 → 2606.76] that we
[2606.76 → 2607.50] all have
[2607.50 → 2608.82] and he
[2608.82 → 2609.50] will respond
[2609.50 → 2610.04] to them
[2610.04 → 2610.74] as Peter
[2610.74 → 2611.14] writes
[2611.14 → 2611.54] at the
[2611.54 → 2611.80] proper
[2611.80 → 2612.18] time
[2612.18 → 2613.98] and that's
[2613.98 → 2614.20] what we're
[2614.20 → 2614.56] seeing from
[2614.56 → 2615.00] God here
[2615.00 → 2615.22] and that
[2615.22 → 2615.70] doesn't mean
[2615.70 → 2616.40] the answer
[2616.40 → 2617.36] will be
[2617.36 → 2617.92] to give
[2617.92 → 2618.18] us
[2618.18 → 2618.68] what we
[2618.68 → 2619.14] want
[2619.14 → 2620.46] but ultimately
[2620.46 → 2621.82] in the end
[2621.82 → 2622.62] Jesus is
[2622.62 → 2623.44] the king
[2623.44 → 2623.74] of our
[2623.74 → 2624.24] longings
[2624.24 → 2624.62] and he
[2624.62 → 2625.20] will
[2625.20 → 2625.92] fulfill
[2625.92 → 2626.30] our
[2626.30 → 2626.70] deepest
[2626.70 → 2627.30] desires
[2627.30 → 2628.06] even
[2628.06 → 2628.66] for joy
[2628.66 → 2630.52] so God
[2630.52 → 2631.02] is answering
[2631.02 → 2631.40] the prayers
[2631.40 → 2631.72] of his
[2631.72 → 2632.16] people
[2632.16 → 2632.68] here
[2632.68 → 2633.28] at the
[2633.28 → 2633.56] proper
[2633.56 → 2634.04] time
[2634.04 → 2634.96] and this
[2634.96 → 2635.22] proper
[2635.22 → 2635.68] time
[2635.68 → 2636.44] was
[2636.44 → 2637.10] hundreds
[2637.10 → 2637.70] of years
[2637.70 → 2638.34] after the
[2638.34 → 2638.84] prophecies
[2638.84 → 2639.32] were given
[2639.32 → 2640.48] you know
[2640.48 → 2640.76] and so
[2640.76 → 2640.92] us
[2640.92 → 2641.18] we don't
[2641.18 → 2641.44] know
[2641.44 → 2641.86] when
[2641.86 → 2643.02] God
[2643.02 → 2643.18] will
[2643.18 → 2643.66] answer
[2643.66 → 2644.92] our
[2644.92 → 2645.34] prayers
[2645.34 → 2645.56] our
[2645.56 → 2646.00] desires
[2646.00 → 2646.94] we
[2646.94 → 2647.08] don't
[2647.08 → 2647.24] know
[2647.24 → 2647.60] how
[2647.60 → 2649.08] but we
[2649.08 → 2649.34] know
[2649.34 → 2649.56] that
[2649.56 → 2649.84] God
[2649.84 → 2650.06] is
[2650.06 → 2650.44] faithful
[2650.44 → 2650.70] to
[2650.70 → 2651.24] himself
[2651.24 → 2652.06] to
[2652.06 → 2652.26] his
[2652.26 → 2652.72] glory
[2652.72 → 2653.06] to
[2653.06 → 2653.28] his
[2653.28 → 2653.76] promises
[2653.76 → 2654.00] to
[2654.00 → 2654.14] his
[2654.14 → 2654.44] people
[2654.44 → 2655.20] and that
[2655.20 → 2655.34] he
[2655.34 → 2655.52] is
[2655.52 → 2655.88] attentive
[2655.88 → 2656.16] to
[2656.16 → 2656.34] our
[2656.34 → 2656.74] needs
[2656.74 → 2658.48] so
[2658.48 → 2659.16] Zechariah
[2659.16 → 2660.36] has heard
[2660.36 → 2660.90] that his
[2660.90 → 2661.24] prayers
[2661.24 → 2661.58] have been
[2661.58 → 2661.96] answered
[2661.96 → 2663.04] he's
[2663.04 → 2663.32] going to
[2663.32 → 2663.60] have a
[2663.60 → 2663.96] child
[2663.96 → 2664.26] and this
[2664.26 → 2664.64] child
[2664.64 → 2664.86] will
[2664.86 → 2665.28] prepare
[2665.28 → 2665.50] the
[2665.50 → 2665.72] way
[2665.72 → 2665.86] for
[2665.86 → 2665.96] the
[2665.96 → 2666.38] Messiah
[2666.38 → 2667.28] who's
[2667.28 → 2667.44] about
[2667.44 → 2667.62] to
[2667.62 → 2667.84] come
[2667.84 → 2669.98] so
[2669.98 → 2670.22] now
[2670.22 → 2670.64] we get
[2670.64 → 2670.92] to
[2670.92 → 2671.50] look
[2671.50 → 2672.54] at
[2672.54 → 2673.22] Zechariah's
[2673.22 → 2673.82] response
[2673.82 → 2674.62] we get
[2674.62 → 2674.96] a look
[2674.96 → 2675.16] into
[2675.16 → 2675.72] Zechariah's
[2675.72 → 2676.00] heart
[2676.00 → 2676.72] so we'll
[2676.72 → 2677.06] read
[2677.06 → 2677.68] the last
[2677.68 → 2678.12] section
[2678.12 → 2678.66] verses
[2678.66 → 2679.26] 18 to
[2679.26 → 2679.78] 25
[2679.78 → 2682.30] Zechariah
[2682.30 → 2682.70] asked
[2682.70 → 2682.86] the
[2682.86 → 2683.20] angel
[2683.20 → 2684.28] how
[2684.28 → 2684.52] can
[2684.52 → 2684.64] I
[2684.64 → 2684.80] be
[2684.80 → 2685.04] sure
[2685.04 → 2685.18] of
[2685.18 → 2685.48] this
[2685.48 → 2686.84] I
[2686.84 → 2686.96] am
[2686.96 → 2687.08] an
[2687.08 → 2687.34] old
[2687.34 → 2687.74] man
[2687.74 → 2688.20] and
[2688.20 → 2688.36] my
[2688.36 → 2688.70] wife
[2688.70 → 2688.86] is
[2688.86 → 2689.06] well
[2689.06 → 2689.40] along
[2689.40 → 2689.56] in
[2689.56 → 2689.94] years
[2689.94 → 2691.42] the
[2691.42 → 2691.66] angel
[2691.66 → 2691.90] said
[2691.90 → 2692.02] to
[2692.02 → 2692.28] him
[2692.28 → 2693.14] I
[2693.14 → 2693.30] am
[2693.30 → 2693.66] Gabriel
[2693.66 → 2694.28] I
[2694.28 → 2694.64] stand
[2694.64 → 2694.74] in
[2694.74 → 2694.86] the
[2694.86 → 2695.10] presence
[2695.10 → 2695.32] of
[2695.32 → 2695.62] God
[2695.62 → 2696.22] I
[2696.22 → 2696.36] have
[2696.36 → 2696.54] been
[2696.54 → 2696.78] sent
[2696.78 → 2696.96] to
[2696.96 → 2697.18] speak
[2697.18 → 2697.36] to
[2697.36 → 2697.64] you
[2697.64 → 2698.02] and
[2698.02 → 2698.14] to
[2698.14 → 2698.30] tell
[2698.30 → 2698.42] you
[2698.42 → 2698.60] this
[2698.60 → 2698.80] good
[2698.80 → 2699.16] news
[2699.16 → 2701.06] and
[2701.06 → 2701.42] now
[2701.42 → 2701.98] you
[2701.98 → 2702.22] will
[2702.22 → 2702.42] be
[2702.42 → 2702.86] silent
[2702.86 → 2703.74] and
[2703.74 → 2704.04] not
[2704.04 → 2704.36] able
[2704.36 → 2704.58] to
[2704.58 → 2704.96] speak
[2704.96 → 2705.42] until
[2705.42 → 2705.60] the
[2705.60 → 2705.80] day
[2705.80 → 2706.00] this
[2706.00 → 2706.38] happens
[2706.38 → 2707.04] because
[2707.04 → 2707.26] you
[2707.26 → 2707.40] did
[2707.40 → 2707.56] not
[2707.56 → 2707.92] believe
[2707.92 → 2708.14] my
[2708.14 → 2708.58] words
[2708.58 → 2709.22] which
[2709.22 → 2709.52] will
[2709.52 → 2709.84] come
[2709.84 → 2710.14] true
[2710.14 → 2710.46] at
[2710.46 → 2710.64] their
[2710.64 → 2711.00] appointed
[2711.00 → 2711.46] time
[2711.46 → 2713.24] meanwhile
[2713.24 → 2713.68] the
[2713.68 → 2714.00] people
[2714.00 → 2714.18] were
[2714.18 → 2714.46] waiting
[2714.46 → 2714.68] for
[2714.68 → 2715.26] Zechariah
[2715.26 → 2715.42] and
[2715.42 → 2715.74] wondering
[2715.74 → 2716.08] why
[2716.08 → 2716.28] he
[2716.28 → 2716.58] stayed
[2716.58 → 2716.80] so
[2716.80 → 2717.06] long
[2717.06 → 2717.18] in
[2717.18 → 2717.28] the
[2717.28 → 2717.54] temple
[2717.54 → 2719.52] when
[2719.52 → 2719.64] he
[2719.64 → 2719.86] came
[2719.86 → 2720.18] out
[2720.18 → 2720.68] he
[2720.68 → 2720.90] could
[2720.90 → 2721.08] not
[2721.08 → 2721.38] speak
[2721.38 → 2721.56] to
[2721.56 → 2721.80] them
[2721.80 → 2722.58] they
[2722.58 → 2723.10] realized
[2723.10 → 2723.28] he
[2723.28 → 2723.40] had
[2723.40 → 2723.60] seen
[2723.60 → 2723.76] a
[2723.76 → 2724.00] vision
[2724.00 → 2724.18] in
[2724.18 → 2724.28] the
[2724.28 → 2724.56] temple
[2724.56 → 2725.18] for
[2725.18 → 2725.30] he
[2725.30 → 2725.48] kept
[2725.48 → 2725.78] making
[2725.78 → 2726.24] signs
[2726.24 → 2726.42] to
[2726.42 → 2726.68] them
[2726.68 → 2727.28] but
[2727.28 → 2727.70] remained
[2727.70 → 2728.20] unable
[2728.20 → 2728.42] to
[2728.42 → 2728.76] speak
[2728.76 → 2729.72] when
[2729.72 → 2729.88] his
[2729.88 → 2730.08] time
[2730.08 → 2730.24] of
[2730.24 → 2730.52] service
[2730.52 → 2730.74] was
[2730.74 → 2731.18] completed
[2731.18 → 2731.86] he
[2731.86 → 2732.22] returned
[2732.22 → 2732.54] home
[2732.54 → 2734.66] after
[2737.26 → 2737.48] and
[2737.48 → 2737.62] for
[2737.62 → 2737.98] five
[2737.98 → 2738.30] months
[2738.30 → 2738.76] remained
[2738.76 → 2738.98] in
[2738.98 → 2739.40] seclusion
[2739.40 → 2740.50] the
[2740.50 → 2740.78] Lord
[2740.78 → 2741.04] has
[2741.04 → 2741.30] done
[2741.30 → 2741.54] this
[2741.54 → 2741.72] for
[2741.72 → 2741.92] me
[2741.92 → 2742.14] she
[2742.14 → 2742.46] said
[2742.46 → 2743.22] and
[2743.22 → 2743.56] these
[2743.56 → 2744.06] days
[2744.06 → 2744.56] he
[2744.56 → 2744.72] has
[2744.72 → 2744.98] shown
[2744.98 → 2745.22] his
[2745.22 → 2745.58] favour
[2745.58 → 2746.20] and
[2746.20 → 2746.50] taken
[2746.50 → 2746.86] away
[2746.86 → 2747.16] my
[2747.16 → 2747.68] disgrace
[2747.68 → 2748.00] among
[2748.00 → 2748.20] the
[2748.20 → 2748.52] people
[2748.52 → 2753.46] Zechariah
[2753.46 → 2753.96] remember
[2753.96 → 2755.04] he is
[2755.04 → 2755.92] a righteous
[2755.92 → 2756.36] man
[2756.36 → 2757.40] right
[2757.40 → 2757.80] he's a
[2757.80 → 2758.10] man
[2758.10 → 2758.40] of
[2758.40 → 2758.88] faith
[2758.88 → 2759.80] he's
[2759.80 → 2760.18] a man
[2760.18 → 2760.40] of
[2760.40 → 2761.24] faithfulness
[2761.24 → 2761.80] he is
[2761.80 → 2762.90] blameless
[2762.90 → 2763.38] and righteous
[2763.38 → 2763.78] before
[2763.78 → 2764.68] before God
[2764.68 → 2765.16] it says
[2765.16 → 2766.68] but what
[2766.68 → 2766.88] the
[2766.88 → 2767.24] angel
[2767.26 → 2767.56] has
[2767.56 → 2767.94] said
[2767.94 → 2768.84] doesn't
[2768.84 → 2769.26] make
[2769.26 → 2769.94] sense
[2769.94 → 2771.08] and
[2771.08 → 2771.24] so
[2771.24 → 2771.46] he
[2771.46 → 2771.90] asked
[2771.90 → 2772.06] what
[2772.06 → 2772.32] seems
[2772.32 → 2772.48] to
[2772.48 → 2772.68] be
[2772.68 → 2772.88] a
[2772.88 → 2773.20] very
[2773.20 → 2773.72] reasonable
[2773.72 → 2774.18] question
[2774.18 → 2774.48] right
[2774.48 → 2775.76] how
[2775.76 → 2776.00] can
[2776.00 → 2776.12] I
[2776.12 → 2776.26] be
[2776.26 → 2776.48] sure
[2776.48 → 2776.64] of
[2776.64 → 2776.92] this
[2776.92 → 2777.48] I'm
[2777.48 → 2777.58] an
[2777.58 → 2777.82] old
[2777.82 → 2778.20] man
[2778.20 → 2778.38] my
[2778.38 → 2778.72] wife
[2778.72 → 2778.90] is
[2778.90 → 2779.08] well
[2779.08 → 2779.38] along
[2779.38 → 2779.54] in
[2779.54 → 2779.90] years
[2779.90 → 2780.94] and
[2780.94 → 2781.42] Gabriel
[2781.42 → 2782.56] responds
[2782.56 → 2783.70] angrily
[2783.70 → 2785.42] and I
[2785.42 → 2785.64] think
[2785.64 → 2785.82] it's
[2785.82 → 2786.20] important
[2786.20 → 2786.48] for
[2786.48 → 2787.00] us
[2787.00 → 2788.28] in
[2788.28 → 2788.74] our
[2788.74 → 2789.26] generation
[2789.26 → 2789.48] in
[2789.48 → 2789.62] our
[2789.62 → 2790.02] time
[2790.02 → 2790.62] to
[2790.62 → 2790.90] think
[2790.90 → 2791.18] about
[2791.18 → 2791.38] this
[2791.38 → 2791.52] for
[2791.52 → 2791.64] a
[2791.64 → 2791.84] minute
[2791.84 → 2792.94] because
[2792.94 → 2793.28] we
[2793.28 → 2793.50] can
[2793.50 → 2793.68] be
[2793.68 → 2793.98] very
[2793.98 → 2794.52] suspicious
[2794.52 → 2795.08] of
[2795.08 → 2795.36] this
[2795.36 → 2795.84] kind
[2795.84 → 2796.04] of
[2796.04 → 2796.36] anger
[2796.36 → 2797.64] right
[2797.64 → 2797.78] we
[2797.78 → 2797.90] can
[2797.90 → 2798.06] be
[2798.06 → 2798.46] suspicious
[2798.46 → 2798.90] that
[2798.90 → 2799.38] angels
[2799.38 → 2799.60] are
[2799.60 → 2799.92] just
[2799.92 → 2800.98] unpredictable
[2800.98 → 2801.98] and you
[2801.98 → 2802.68] just don't
[2802.68 → 2803.22] like
[2803.22 → 2803.66] they just
[2803.66 → 2803.96] don't like
[2803.96 → 2804.32] being asked
[2804.32 → 2804.82] questions
[2804.82 → 2805.66] right
[2805.66 → 2805.92] you never
[2805.92 → 2806.30] know what
[2806.30 → 2806.44] they're
[2806.44 → 2806.62] going to
[2806.62 → 2806.96] do
[2806.96 → 2808.58] we
[2808.58 → 2808.74] can
[2808.74 → 2808.90] be
[2808.90 → 2809.30] suspicious
[2809.30 → 2809.66] that
[2809.66 → 2810.26] God
[2810.26 → 2811.32] is
[2811.32 → 2811.56] kind
[2811.56 → 2811.70] of
[2811.70 → 2812.28] prickly
[2812.28 → 2814.74] who
[2814.74 → 2815.70] angry
[2815.70 → 2816.24] and easily
[2816.24 → 2818.00] but
[2818.00 → 2818.38] that's
[2818.38 → 2818.56] not
[2818.56 → 2818.76] it
[2818.76 → 2819.04] that's
[2819.04 → 2819.14] not
[2819.14 → 2819.32] what's
[2819.32 → 2819.48] going
[2819.48 → 2819.82] on
[2819.82 → 2820.74] we
[2820.74 → 2820.98] need
[2820.98 → 2821.12] to
[2821.12 → 2821.56] realize
[2821.56 → 2821.84] that
[2821.84 → 2822.26] Gabriel
[2822.26 → 2823.10] is
[2823.10 → 2823.58] used
[2823.58 → 2823.80] to
[2823.80 → 2824.36] standing
[2824.36 → 2824.90] in
[2824.90 → 2825.12] the
[2825.12 → 2825.46] real
[2825.46 → 2826.04] presence
[2826.04 → 2826.34] of
[2826.34 → 2826.80] God
[2826.80 → 2827.84] he's
[2827.84 → 2828.04] used
[2828.04 → 2828.20] to
[2828.20 → 2828.42] being
[2828.42 → 2828.64] in
[2828.64 → 2828.80] the
[2828.80 → 2829.12] real
[2829.12 → 2829.52] temple
[2829.52 → 2829.82] that
[2829.82 → 2830.08] this
[2830.08 → 2830.44] earthly
[2830.44 → 2830.74] one
[2830.74 → 2830.88] is
[2830.88 → 2831.06] just
[2831.06 → 2831.26] a
[2831.26 → 2831.50] mild
[2831.50 → 2831.86] picture
[2831.86 → 2832.22] of
[2832.22 → 2833.68] Gabriel
[2833.68 → 2835.02] knows
[2835.02 → 2835.28] the
[2835.28 → 2835.92] power
[2835.92 → 2836.32] of
[2836.32 → 2836.76] God
[2836.76 → 2837.98] he
[2837.98 → 2838.30] knows
[2838.30 → 2838.60] God
[2838.60 → 2838.80] can
[2838.80 → 2839.44] easily
[2839.44 → 2839.74] do
[2839.74 → 2840.16] this
[2840.16 → 2841.70] but
[2841.70 → 2842.02] friends
[2842.02 → 2842.30] so
[2842.30 → 2842.48] does
[2842.48 → 2843.14] Zechariah
[2843.14 → 2844.46] the
[2844.46 → 2844.90] priest
[2844.90 → 2845.14] has
[2845.14 → 2845.54] read
[2845.54 → 2845.74] of
[2845.74 → 2846.22] children
[2846.22 → 2846.60] being
[2846.60 → 2846.94] given
[2846.94 → 2847.14] to
[2847.14 → 2847.48] couples
[2847.48 → 2847.68] too
[2847.68 → 2847.90] old
[2847.90 → 2848.06] for
[2848.06 → 2848.32] them
[2848.32 → 2848.80] at
[2848.80 → 2849.26] several
[2849.26 → 2849.72] important
[2849.72 → 2850.14] points
[2850.14 → 2850.26] in
[2850.26 → 2850.36] the
[2850.36 → 2850.58] history
[2850.58 → 2850.74] of
[2850.74 → 2851.06] Israel
[2851.06 → 2852.38] so
[2852.38 → 2852.92] Gabriel
[2852.92 → 2853.78] recognizes
[2853.78 → 2854.16] that
[2854.16 → 2854.46] this
[2854.46 → 2855.28] response
[2855.28 → 2856.14] this
[2856.14 → 2856.78] question
[2856.78 → 2857.64] is
[2857.64 → 2857.92] not
[2857.92 → 2858.14] as
[2858.14 → 2858.64] innocent
[2858.64 → 2859.04] as
[2859.04 → 2859.16] it
[2859.16 → 2859.32] may
[2859.32 → 2859.56] sound
[2859.56 → 2859.74] to
[2859.74 → 2859.94] our
[2859.94 → 2860.36] ears
[2860.36 → 2861.66] Gabriel
[2861.66 → 2862.12] knows
[2862.12 → 2862.30] that
[2862.30 → 2862.42] it
[2862.42 → 2862.56] is
[2862.56 → 2862.68] a
[2862.68 → 2863.10] response
[2863.10 → 2863.22] of
[2863.22 → 2863.74] unbelief
[2863.74 → 2864.66] right
[2864.66 → 2864.86] it
[2864.86 → 2865.22] sounds
[2865.22 → 2865.74] reasonable
[2865.74 → 2866.90] but
[2866.90 → 2867.12] it
[2867.12 → 2867.34] is
[2867.34 → 2868.22] unbelief
[2868.22 → 2869.50] even
[2869.50 → 2869.98] good
[2869.98 → 2870.14] and
[2870.14 → 2870.36] righteous
[2870.36 → 2870.78] people
[2870.78 → 2870.98] can
[2870.98 → 2871.26] doubt
[2871.26 → 2873.22] and
[2873.22 → 2873.60] so
[2873.60 → 2875.70] let's
[2875.70 → 2876.08] talk about
[2876.08 → 2876.34] doubt
[2876.34 → 2876.62] for a
[2876.62 → 2876.78] minute
[2876.78 → 2877.28] not
[2877.28 → 2877.60] all
[2877.60 → 2877.98] forms
[2877.98 → 2878.16] of
[2878.16 → 2878.46] doubt
[2878.46 → 2879.40] are
[2879.40 → 2879.76] bad
[2879.76 → 2880.50] right
[2880.50 → 2880.72] some
[2880.72 → 2880.92] doubt
[2880.92 → 2881.10] can
[2881.10 → 2881.28] be
[2881.28 → 2881.54] good
[2881.54 → 2881.82] like
[2881.82 → 2882.22] self
[2882.22 → 2882.56] doubt
[2882.56 → 2882.76] you
[2882.76 → 2883.32] know
[2883.32 → 2884.04] self
[2884.04 → 2884.40] doubt
[2884.40 → 2884.60] can
[2884.60 → 2884.72] be
[2884.72 → 2884.86] a
[2884.86 → 2885.04] sign
[2885.04 → 2885.16] of
[2885.16 → 2885.66] maturity
[2885.66 → 2886.10] and
[2886.10 → 2887.64] reasonableness
[2887.64 → 2888.08] so
[2888.08 → 2888.20] if
[2888.20 → 2888.78] Zechariah
[2888.78 → 2888.90] is
[2888.90 → 2889.04] just
[2889.04 → 2889.28] looking
[2889.28 → 2889.50] at
[2889.50 → 2889.80] his
[2889.80 → 2890.32] old
[2890.32 → 2890.72] body
[2890.72 → 2891.06] thinking
[2891.06 → 2891.38] about
[2891.38 → 2891.54] his
[2891.54 → 2891.90] wife
[2891.90 → 2892.46] and
[2892.46 → 2892.68] he's
[2892.68 → 2892.98] saying
[2892.98 → 2893.28] I
[2893.28 → 2893.76] literally
[2893.76 → 2894.48] don't
[2894.48 → 2894.76] have
[2894.76 → 2894.90] the
[2894.90 → 2895.30] ability
[2895.30 → 2896.12] to
[2896.12 → 2896.34] father
[2896.34 → 2896.52] a
[2896.52 → 2896.76] child
[2896.76 → 2897.02] because
[2897.02 → 2897.16] I'm
[2897.16 → 2897.36] so
[2897.36 → 2897.70] old
[2897.70 → 2898.62] right
[2898.62 → 2899.04] that's
[2899.04 → 2899.38] not
[2899.38 → 2900.18] necessarily
[2900.18 → 2900.58] a
[2900.58 → 2900.80] bad
[2900.80 → 2901.16] thing
[2901.16 → 2902.94] there's
[2902.94 → 2903.18] also
[2903.18 → 2903.38] a
[2903.38 → 2903.56] part
[2903.56 → 2903.70] of
[2903.70 → 2904.04] doubt
[2904.04 → 2904.34] which
[2904.34 → 2904.50] is
[2904.50 → 2904.72] just
[2904.72 → 2905.16] knowing
[2905.16 → 2905.44] what
[2905.44 → 2905.60] you
[2905.60 → 2905.88] don't
[2905.88 → 2906.18] know
[2906.18 → 2907.36] or
[2907.36 → 2907.64] knowing
[2907.64 → 2907.86] that
[2907.86 → 2908.04] you
[2908.04 → 2908.32] don't
[2908.32 → 2908.50] know
[2908.50 → 2908.84] things
[2908.84 → 2909.06] right
[2909.06 → 2909.52] it's
[2909.52 → 2909.84] okay
[2909.84 → 2910.12] to
[2910.12 → 2910.62] have
[2910.62 → 2910.90] faith
[2910.90 → 2911.06] in
[2911.06 → 2911.48] Jesus
[2911.48 → 2912.94] but
[2912.94 → 2913.16] to
[2913.16 → 2913.44] know
[2913.44 → 2913.72] that
[2913.72 → 2913.90] you
[2913.90 → 2914.32] don't
[2914.32 → 2914.84] have
[2914.84 → 2915.18] all
[2915.18 → 2915.34] of
[2915.34 → 2915.52] the
[2915.52 → 2916.10] answers
[2916.10 → 2917.12] right
[2917.12 → 2917.30] you're
[2917.30 → 2917.50] still
[2917.50 → 2918.24] struggling
[2918.24 → 2918.46] to
[2918.46 → 2918.66] figure
[2918.66 → 2918.82] it
[2918.82 → 2918.98] all
[2918.98 → 2919.30] out
[2919.30 → 2919.84] you
[2919.84 → 2919.94] know
[2919.94 → 2920.12] and
[2920.12 → 2920.24] so
[2920.24 → 2920.38] you
[2920.38 → 2920.52] might
[2920.52 → 2920.78] say
[2920.78 → 2921.26] Lord
[2921.26 → 2922.58] I
[2922.58 → 2923.00] don't
[2923.00 → 2923.16] know
[2923.16 → 2923.34] how
[2923.34 → 2923.56] this
[2923.56 → 2923.72] is
[2923.72 → 2923.88] going
[2923.88 → 2924.00] to
[2924.00 → 2924.38] work
[2924.38 → 2925.58] and
[2925.58 → 2925.84] that's
[2925.84 → 2926.28] okay
[2926.28 → 2926.60] it's
[2926.60 → 2926.74] kind
[2926.74 → 2926.78] of
[2926.78 → 2926.92] an
[2926.92 → 2927.50] honest
[2927.50 → 2928.48] question
[2928.48 → 2930.02] but
[2930.02 → 2930.24] then
[2930.24 → 2930.52] there's
[2930.52 → 2930.70] a
[2930.70 → 2930.98] doubt
[2930.98 → 2931.22] that
[2931.22 → 2931.40] is
[2931.40 → 2931.98] contrary
[2931.98 → 2932.30] to
[2932.30 → 2932.66] faith
[2932.66 → 2933.92] it's
[2933.92 → 2934.12] a
[2934.12 → 2934.46] doubt
[2934.46 → 2934.80] that
[2934.80 → 2935.56] doubts
[2935.56 → 2936.06] God's
[2936.06 → 2936.58] promises
[2936.58 → 2937.24] it
[2937.24 → 2937.60] doubts
[2937.60 → 2938.08] God's
[2938.08 → 2938.60] ability
[2938.60 → 2938.86] to
[2938.86 → 2939.26] do
[2939.26 → 2940.04] what
[2940.04 → 2940.28] he
[2940.28 → 2940.78] says
[2940.78 → 2941.00] he
[2941.00 → 2941.18] is
[2941.18 → 2941.40] going
[2941.40 → 2941.60] to
[2941.60 → 2941.90] do
[2941.90 → 2942.82] and
[2942.82 → 2943.08] this
[2943.08 → 2943.22] is
[2943.22 → 2943.38] the
[2943.38 → 2943.66] sort
[2943.66 → 2943.78] of
[2943.78 → 2944.16] doubt
[2944.16 → 2944.58] that
[2944.58 → 2945.56] erodes
[2945.56 → 2945.80] our
[2945.80 → 2946.28] hearts
[2946.28 → 2947.20] and
[2947.20 → 2947.36] it
[2947.36 → 2947.74] fills
[2947.74 → 2947.90] it
[2947.90 → 2948.06] with
[2948.06 → 2949.10] unbelief
[2949.10 → 2949.36] that
[2949.36 → 2949.90] stops
[2949.90 → 2950.12] us
[2950.12 → 2950.30] from
[2950.30 → 2950.74] trusting
[2950.74 → 2951.08] in
[2951.08 → 2951.42] God
[2951.42 → 2952.36] and
[2952.36 → 2952.48] I
[2952.48 → 2952.72] think
[2952.72 → 2953.08] that is
[2953.08 → 2953.28] what
[2953.28 → 2953.42] is
[2953.42 → 2953.84] happening
[2953.84 → 2954.06] to
[2954.06 → 2954.66] Zachariah
[2954.66 → 2954.96] here
[2954.96 → 2956.18] and
[2956.18 → 2957.18] we
[2957.18 → 2957.36] can
[2957.36 → 2957.88] understand
[2957.88 → 2958.12] this
[2958.12 → 2958.24] it
[2958.24 → 2958.40] kind
[2958.40 → 2958.52] of
[2958.52 → 2958.70] looks
[2958.70 → 2958.88] like
[2958.88 → 2959.10] the
[2959.10 → 2959.82] barrenness
[2959.82 → 2960.06] of
[2960.06 → 2961.30] Elizabeth's
[2961.30 → 2961.62] womb
[2961.62 → 2961.90] and
[2961.90 → 2962.70] their
[2962.70 → 2963.40] circumstances
[2963.40 → 2964.38] the
[2964.38 → 2964.96] barrenness
[2964.96 → 2965.26] of the
[2965.26 → 2965.66] world
[2965.66 → 2966.38] in which
[2966.38 → 2966.64] they are
[2966.64 → 2967.02] living
[2967.02 → 2968.26] all
[2968.26 → 2968.56] those
[2968.56 → 2968.94] years
[2968.94 → 2969.18] of
[2969.18 → 2969.90] difficulty
[2969.90 → 2970.76] and
[2970.76 → 2971.50] disappointment
[2971.50 → 2972.56] it
[2972.56 → 2972.78] has
[2972.78 → 2973.14] spread
[2973.14 → 2973.32] to
[2973.32 → 2973.92] Zachariah's
[2973.92 → 2974.24] heart
[2974.24 → 2975.24] he is
[2975.24 → 2975.46] still
[2975.46 → 2975.64] a
[2975.64 → 2975.92] faithful
[2975.92 → 2976.46] priest
[2976.46 → 2976.82] but
[2976.82 → 2977.68] man
[2977.68 → 2978.54] it's
[2978.54 → 2978.80] looking
[2978.80 → 2979.56] like
[2979.56 → 2979.94] where
[2979.94 → 2980.24] is
[2980.24 → 2980.62] God
[2980.62 → 2981.62] and
[2981.62 → 2981.72] it
[2981.72 → 2981.88] has
[2981.88 → 2982.16] made
[2982.16 → 2982.56] him
[2982.56 → 2983.46] it
[2983.46 → 2983.60] has
[2983.60 → 2983.76] made
[2983.76 → 2983.90] it
[2983.90 → 2984.24] difficult
[2984.24 → 2984.54] for
[2984.54 → 2984.88] him
[2984.88 → 2985.08] to
[2985.08 → 2985.54] trust
[2985.54 → 2986.00] God
[2986.00 → 2987.44] in
[2987.44 → 2987.80] God's
[2987.80 → 2988.04] word
[2988.04 → 2989.76] but
[2989.76 → 2989.98] there's
[2989.98 → 2990.08] a
[2990.08 → 2990.46] consequence
[2990.46 → 2990.86] for
[2990.86 → 2991.22] this
[2991.22 → 2991.88] verse
[2991.88 → 2992.22] 20
[2992.22 → 2992.78] says
[2992.78 → 2994.42] the
[2994.42 → 2994.72] angel
[2994.72 → 2995.06] says
[2995.06 → 2995.26] you
[2995.26 → 2995.64] now
[2995.64 → 2995.86] will
[2995.86 → 2996.02] be
[2996.02 → 2996.46] silent
[2996.46 → 2996.64] and
[2996.64 → 2996.82] not
[2996.82 → 2997.02] able
[2997.02 → 2997.20] to
[2997.20 → 2997.44] speak
[2997.44 → 2997.72] until
[2997.72 → 2997.90] the
[2997.90 → 2998.06] day
[2998.06 → 2998.24] this
[2998.24 → 2998.60] happens
[2998.60 → 2999.32] because
[2999.32 → 2999.56] you
[2999.56 → 2999.70] did
[2999.70 → 2999.90] not
[2999.90 → 3000.24] believe
[3000.24 → 3000.42] my
[3000.42 → 3000.84] words
[3000.84 → 3001.74] so
[3001.74 → 3001.88] it's
[3001.88 → 3002.22] telling us
[3002.22 → 3002.76] Zachariah
[3002.76 → 3003.14] did
[3003.14 → 3003.38] not
[3003.38 → 3003.78] believe
[3003.78 → 3005.78] which
[3005.78 → 3006.00] will
[3006.00 → 3006.26] come
[3006.26 → 3006.66] true
[3006.66 → 3007.00] at
[3007.00 → 3007.12] their
[3007.12 → 3007.40] proper
[3007.40 → 3007.74] time
[3007.74 → 3009.14] so
[3009.14 → 3009.68] Zachariah
[3009.68 → 3010.18] struck
[3010.18 → 3010.40] the
[3010.40 → 3010.74] priest
[3010.74 → 3010.96] with
[3010.96 → 3011.14] a
[3011.14 → 3011.76] mild
[3011.76 → 3012.66] sign
[3012.66 → 3012.92] of
[3012.92 → 3013.56] muteness
[3013.56 → 3014.38] which
[3014.38 → 3014.94] nevertheless
[3014.94 → 3016.36] spoke
[3016.36 → 3016.78] loudly
[3016.78 → 3018.88] and
[3018.88 → 3019.20] here's
[3019.20 → 3019.34] the
[3019.34 → 3019.60] beautiful
[3019.60 → 3019.92] thing
[3019.92 → 3020.10] about
[3020.10 → 3020.30] this
[3020.30 → 3020.72] passage
[3020.72 → 3023.06] Zachariah's
[3023.06 → 3023.60] doubt
[3023.60 → 3025.06] that
[3025.06 → 3025.72] eroded
[3025.72 → 3026.02] his
[3026.02 → 3026.42] faith
[3026.42 → 3026.96] in God
[3026.96 → 3027.40] and God's
[3027.40 → 3027.90] promises
[3027.90 → 3028.44] and God's
[3028.44 → 3028.86] ability
[3028.86 → 3031.26] this
[3031.26 → 3031.96] barrenness
[3031.96 → 3032.48] of heart
[3032.48 → 3032.68] that
[3032.68 → 3033.20] Zachariah
[3033.20 → 3033.54] has
[3033.54 → 3033.70] that
[3033.70 → 3034.14] doesn't
[3034.14 → 3034.86] change
[3034.86 → 3035.94] God's
[3035.94 → 3036.56] loving
[3036.56 → 3036.84] and
[3036.84 → 3037.44] faithful
[3037.44 → 3038.08] gracious
[3038.08 → 3038.92] actions
[3038.92 → 3039.22] toward
[3039.22 → 3039.48] him
[3039.48 → 3040.34] right
[3040.34 → 3040.58] God
[3040.58 → 3040.86] doesn't
[3040.86 → 3041.06] look
[3041.06 → 3041.20] at
[3041.20 → 3041.66] Zachariah
[3041.66 → 3042.06] and say
[3042.06 → 3042.34] like
[3042.34 → 3043.06] look
[3043.06 → 3043.66] Zachariah
[3043.66 → 3043.88] you
[3043.88 → 3044.32] doubted
[3044.32 → 3044.56] me
[3044.56 → 3045.06] so
[3045.06 → 3045.32] now
[3045.32 → 3045.52] you're
[3045.52 → 3045.74] not
[3045.74 → 3045.84] going
[3045.84 → 3045.90] to
[3045.90 → 3046.06] have
[3046.06 → 3046.20] a
[3046.20 → 3046.48] son
[3046.48 → 3048.18] right
[3048.18 → 3048.40] so
[3048.40 → 3049.34] Zachariah's
[3049.34 → 3049.98] struggle
[3049.98 → 3050.34] to
[3050.34 → 3050.64] trust
[3050.64 → 3050.94] God
[3050.94 → 3051.32] doesn't
[3051.32 → 3051.82] determine
[3051.82 → 3052.30] God's
[3052.30 → 3052.92] faithfulness
[3052.92 → 3053.96] it
[3053.96 → 3054.76] doesn't
[3054.76 → 3055.32] determine
[3055.32 → 3057.32] God's
[3057.32 → 3057.92] response
[3057.92 → 3058.26] and that
[3058.26 → 3058.56] God
[3058.56 → 3058.78] is
[3058.78 → 3059.18] faithful
[3059.18 → 3059.46] to
[3059.46 → 3059.64] his
[3059.64 → 3060.10] promises
[3060.10 → 3060.94] even
[3060.94 → 3061.74] despite
[3061.74 → 3062.70] our
[3062.70 → 3063.16] doubts
[3063.16 → 3063.36] and
[3063.36 → 3063.96] our
[3063.96 → 3064.74] unbelief
[3064.74 → 3065.84] and
[3065.84 → 3066.06] friends
[3066.06 → 3066.32] God
[3066.32 → 3066.50] is
[3066.50 → 3066.76] faithful
[3066.76 → 3067.00] to
[3067.00 → 3067.16] us
[3067.16 → 3067.42] too
[3067.42 → 3068.42] right
[3068.42 → 3068.58] the
[3068.58 → 3068.88] good
[3068.88 → 3069.16] news
[3069.16 → 3069.32] of
[3069.32 → 3069.46] the
[3069.46 → 3069.84] gospel
[3069.84 → 3070.10] is
[3070.10 → 3070.30] that
[3070.30 → 3070.60] through
[3070.60 → 3071.12] Jesus
[3071.12 → 3071.94] that
[3071.94 → 3072.24] we
[3072.24 → 3072.52] can
[3072.52 → 3072.98] come
[3072.98 → 3073.22] to
[3073.22 → 3073.52] God
[3073.52 → 3073.84] just
[3073.84 → 3074.14] as
[3074.14 → 3074.36] we
