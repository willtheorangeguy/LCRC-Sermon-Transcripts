[289.06 --> 291.06]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[291.06 --> 295.06]  We are so grateful you decided to tune into our service today.
[295.06 --> 300.06]  My name is Ashley and with me today is a Sifuwe and Mel on the organ.
[300.06 --> 308.06]  Later on in the service, we are privileged to hear guest pastor Albert Chu from the Tapestry Enrichment as he preaches the sermon today.
[308.06 --> 313.06]  I think sometimes we feel like we need to be in the mood for church on Sunday morning.
[313.06 --> 319.06]  That we need to come happy and joyful, but we need to remember that God calls us to him as we are.
[319.06 --> 323.06]  Whether happy or sad, excited or anxious for the week ahead,
[323.06 --> 327.06]  God is always ready to welcome us with open arms.
[327.06 --> 328.06]  The Bible says,
[328.06 --> 331.06]  Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.
[331.06 --> 336.06]  So let's begin our time of worship by singing this morning with this in mind.
[336.06 --> 338.06]  The Bible says,
[338.06 --> 341.06]  The Bible says,
[341.06 --> 343.06]  Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.
[343.06 --> 353.06]  Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.
[353.06 --> 358.06]  Heir of salvation, purchased by the Lord.
[358.06 --> 363.06]  Born of his soul, born of his spirit, washed in his blood.
[363.06 --> 365.06]  This is my story, this is my song.
[365.06 --> 367.06]  Praise and glory, God is mine.
[367.06 --> 368.06]  Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.
[368.06 --> 371.06]  Heir of salvation, purchased by the Lord.
[371.06 --> 373.06]  Born of his spirit, washed in his blood.
[373.06 --> 378.06]  Born of his spirit, washed in his blood.
[378.06 --> 387.06]  This is my story, this is my song.
[387.06 --> 393.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[393.06 --> 400.06]  This is my story, this is my song.
[400.06 --> 408.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[408.06 --> 415.06]  Perfect submission, perfect delight.
[415.06 --> 422.06]  Visions of love shall now burst on my sight.
[422.06 --> 429.06]  Angels descending, ringing from above.
[429.06 --> 437.06]  Echoes of love, echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
[437.06 --> 444.06]  This is my story, this is my song.
[444.06 --> 451.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[451.06 --> 458.06]  This is my story, this is my song.
[458.06 --> 467.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[467.06 --> 475.06]  Perfect submission, all is at rest.
[475.06 --> 481.06]  I in my Savior am happy and blessed.
[481.06 --> 488.06]  Watching and waiting, looking above
[488.06 --> 496.06]  Filled with his goodness, lost in his love
[496.06 --> 503.06]  This is my story, this is my song
[503.06 --> 510.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long
[510.06 --> 518.06]  This is my story, this is my song
[518.06 --> 526.06]  Praising my Savior all the day long
[540.06 --> 550.06]  Jesus said that if I thirst I should come to Him
[550.06 --> 562.06]  Jesus said that if I thirst I should come to Him
[562.06 --> 572.06]  No one else can satisfy I should come to Him
[572.06 --> 584.06]  Jesus said that if I am weak I should come to Him
[584.06 --> 594.06]  No one else can be my strength I should come to Him
[594.06 --> 608.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will keep us day and night
[608.06 --> 616.06]  We can always run to Jesus
[616.06 --> 620.06]  Jesus strong and kind
[620.06 --> 632.06]  Jesus said that if I fear I should come to Him
[632.06 --> 634.06]  Jesus said that if I thirst I should come to Him
[634.06 --> 644.06]  No one else can be my shield I should come to Him
[644.06 --> 656.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will keep us day and night
[656.06 --> 662.06]  We can always run to Jesus
[662.06 --> 668.06]  Jesus strong and kind
[668.06 --> 670.06]  Jesus said that if I am lost He will come to me
[670.06 --> 682.06]  Jesus said that if I am lost He will come to me
[682.06 --> 686.06]  And He showed me on that cross He will come to me
[686.06 --> 690.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will come to me
[690.06 --> 706.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will keep us day and night
[706.06 --> 714.06]  We can always run to Jesus Jesus strong and kind
[714.06 --> 718.06]  Jesus strong and kind
[718.06 --> 720.06]  Jesus said that if I am lost He will come to me
[720.06 --> 724.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will keep us day and night
[724.06 --> 730.06]  For the Lord is good and faithful He will keep us day and night
[730.06 --> 744.06]  We can always run to Jesus Jesus strong and kind
[744.06 --> 746.06]  Lord let you
[746.06 --> 750.06]  Lord let you
[750.06 --> 754.06]  Light of your face shine on the light of your face
[754.06 --> 758.06]  Light of your face shine on us
[758.06 --> 774.06]  Lord let you light
[774.06 --> 776.06]  Light of your face shine on us
[776.06 --> 786.06]  Lord let you light
[786.06 --> 788.06]  Lord let you light
[788.06 --> 794.06]  Light of your face shine on us
[794.06 --> 796.06]  Lord let you light
[796.06 --> 798.06]  Light of your face shine on us
[798.06 --> 804.06]  Lord let you light
[804.06 --> 808.06]  Light of us shine on us
[808.06 --> 810.06]  Lord let you light
[810.06 --> 812.06]  Light of your face shine on us
[812.06 --> 818.06]  Lord let you light
[818.06 --> 820.06]  Light of our face shine on us
[820.06 --> 822.40]  on us.
[824.46 --> 825.46]  Lord,
[827.26 --> 829.84]  let your grace,
[830.38 --> 831.80]  grace from your
[831.80 --> 833.42]  hand
[833.42 --> 836.06]  fall on us.
[838.06 --> 839.34]  Lord,
[840.86 --> 841.78]  let your
[841.78 --> 843.18]  grace,
[843.82 --> 846.06]  grace from your hand
[846.88 --> 848.06]  fall on
[848.06 --> 850.46]  us.
[850.76 --> 852.46]  That we
[852.46 --> 856.06]  may be saved,
[857.54 --> 859.56]  that we
[859.56 --> 862.14]  may have
[862.14 --> 863.90]  life,
[863.90 --> 865.90]  to find our way
[867.28 --> 869.90]  in the darkest night.
[871.68 --> 873.90]  Let your love
[873.90 --> 877.28]  fall on us.
[878.06 --> 880.06]  Lord,
[882.06 --> 884.06]  let your love,
[884.06 --> 887.06]  love with no end,
[887.06 --> 891.06]  come over us.
[891.46 --> 893.46]  Lord,
[893.46 --> 895.46]  let your love,
[895.46 --> 899.46]  love with no end,
[899.46 --> 901.46]  come over us.
[901.46 --> 903.46]  come over us.
[903.46 --> 906.46]  That we
[906.46 --> 908.46]  may be saved,
[908.46 --> 909.46]  that we
[909.46 --> 910.46]  may be saved,
[910.46 --> 912.46]  that we
[912.46 --> 914.46]  may have life,
[914.46 --> 916.46]  that we may
[916.46 --> 918.46]  may have life,
[918.46 --> 920.46]  to find our way
[920.46 --> 922.46]  in the darkest night.
[922.46 --> 924.46]  in the darkest night.
[924.46 --> 928.46]  Let your love,
[928.46 --> 932.46]  come over us.
[932.46 --> 937.46]  Let your light shine on us.
[937.46 --> 938.46]  let your love,
[938.46 --> 939.46]  come over us.
[939.46 --> 940.46]  come over us.
[940.46 --> 941.46]  come over us.
[941.46 --> 942.46]  come over us.
[942.46 --> 943.46]  come over us.
[943.46 --> 947.46]  Worship is more than just singing songs to God.
[947.46 --> 949.46]  It is also about coming before him,
[949.46 --> 950.46]  it is also about coming before him,
[950.46 --> 951.46]  and confessing our sins,
[951.46 --> 953.46]  so that he can renew us,
[953.46 --> 954.46]  and make us whole again.
[954.46 --> 957.46]  Because Jesus died on the cross for our sins,
[957.46 --> 959.46]  in Hebrews 4, 16,
[959.46 --> 960.46]  it says,
[960.46 --> 965.46]  let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence,
[965.46 --> 967.46]  so that we may receive mercy,
[967.46 --> 970.46]  and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[970.46 --> 972.46]  Let's pray.
[972.46 --> 974.46]  Holy and merciful God,
[974.46 --> 977.46]  in your presence we confess our sinfulness,
[977.46 --> 979.46]  our shortcomings,
[979.46 --> 981.46]  and our offenses against you.
[981.46 --> 984.46]  You alone know how often we've sinned,
[984.46 --> 986.46]  in wandering from your ways,
[986.46 --> 988.46]  in wasting your gifts,
[988.46 --> 990.46]  in forgetting your love.
[990.46 --> 992.46]  Have mercy on us, O Lord,
[992.46 --> 994.46]  for we are ashamed,
[994.46 --> 997.46]  and we are sorry for all we have done to displease you.
[997.46 --> 999.46]  Forgive our sins,
[999.46 --> 1001.46]  and help us to live in your light,
[1001.46 --> 1002.46]  and walk in your ways,
[1002.46 --> 1004.46]  for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[1004.46 --> 1005.46]  our Savior.
[1005.46 --> 1006.46]  Amen.
[1006.46 --> 1008.46]  Let's sing the river.
[1018.46 --> 1030.46]  To the river, I am going,
[1030.46 --> 1036.46]  breaking sins I cannot bear.
[1036.46 --> 1040.46]  Come and cleanse me,
[1040.46 --> 1043.46]  come forgive me,
[1043.46 --> 1049.46]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1049.46 --> 1053.46]  In these waters,
[1053.46 --> 1056.46]  healing mercy,
[1056.46 --> 1062.46]  flows with freedom from despair.
[1062.46 --> 1069.46]  I am going to the river,
[1069.46 --> 1075.46]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1075.46 --> 1083.46]  Precious Jesus, I am ready,
[1083.46 --> 1089.46]  to surrender every care.
[1089.46 --> 1092.46]  Take my hand now,
[1092.46 --> 1096.46]  lead me closer.
[1096.46 --> 1102.46]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1102.46 --> 1109.46]  Come and join us in the river.
[1109.46 --> 1115.46]  Come find life beyond compare.
[1115.46 --> 1117.46]  every care of J.
[1117.46 --> 1119.46]  He is calling,
[1119.46 --> 1120.46]  He is waiting,
[1120.46 --> 1122.46]  He is waiting,
[1122.46 --> 1128.46]  Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1128.46 --> 1132.46]  He is calling,
[1132.46 --> 1135.46]  he is waiting,
[1135.46 --> 1141.46]  Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1141.46 --> 1154.46]  Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1154.46 --> 1168.46]  Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1168.46 --> 1183.46]  Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1186.46 --> 1191.46]  Listen to what the Psalms has to say about God's mercy towards us.
[1191.46 --> 1193.46]  It's from the number 103.
[1193.46 --> 1199.46]  The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[1199.46 --> 1203.46]  He will not always accuse, nor will he keep his anger forever.
[1203.46 --> 1209.46]  He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
[1209.46 --> 1217.46]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love towards those who fear him.
[1217.46 --> 1223.46]  As far as the east is from the west, so far he has removed our transgressions from us.
[1223.46 --> 1230.46]  And as a father has compassion for his children, so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him.
[1230.46 --> 1234.46]  Amen. Let's welcome Pastor Albert Chu today.
[1234.46 --> 1248.46]  Good morning. My name is Howard. I'm the lead pastor of the Tap Street Church Network.
[1248.46 --> 1253.46]  And delighted to be with you virtually here at an address here at C.
[1253.46 --> 1261.46]  Fun fact, before I begin, some of you may have noticed, but this building is actually quite identical in size and dimension
[1261.46 --> 1264.46]  to the Richmond campus of the Tapestry.
[1264.46 --> 1268.46]  Because when they built these two buildings, they used the same blueprint.
[1268.46 --> 1272.46]  And so every time I come into this building and stand here in the sanctuary,
[1272.46 --> 1276.46]  it's vaguely similar and yet very different as well.
[1276.46 --> 1281.46]  Nevertheless, delighted as always to be here in Ladner.
[1281.46 --> 1285.46]  Now, I understand that as a church you are going through the Book of Acts,
[1285.46 --> 1290.46]  which excites me because the Book of Acts is one of my favorite books in the Bible, bar none.
[1290.46 --> 1297.46]  Because it tells the story of the early church and about the very first church plants that took place in history.
[1297.46 --> 1303.46]  And one of my favorite persons or characters in the Book of Acts is the disciple Philip.
[1303.46 --> 1307.46]  That's right, Philip. Now, a lot of people don't preach about Philip,
[1307.46 --> 1313.46]  but for some reason the story of Philip really resonates with me, and I'd like to show you why.
[1313.46 --> 1319.46]  So, Philip is first mentioned in John chapter 1, when Jesus decides to call his inner twelve.
[1319.46 --> 1322.46]  And this is how he is introduced in the Gospel of John.
[1322.46 --> 1327.46]  And I'm going to start reading in chapter 1, verse 43, and you can follow along on the PowerPoint.
[1327.46 --> 1332.46]  The next day, Jesus decided to leave for Galilee, finding Philip.
[1332.46 --> 1334.46]  He said to him, follow me.
[1334.46 --> 1337.46]  Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
[1337.46 --> 1339.46]  Philip found Nathanael and told him,
[1339.46 --> 1342.46]  We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law,
[1342.46 --> 1346.46]  and about whom the prophets also wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
[1346.46 --> 1350.46]  Nazareth? Can anything good come from there? Nathanael asked.
[1350.46 --> 1354.46]  Come and see, said Philip.
[1354.46 --> 1357.46]  So what does this introduction tell us about Philip?
[1357.46 --> 1358.46]  Four things.
[1358.46 --> 1360.46]  First, he's from the town of Bethsaida.
[1360.46 --> 1362.46]  So here's a map of the region.
[1362.46 --> 1367.46]  Bethsaida, if you look at the map, sits on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee,
[1367.46 --> 1369.46]  near the inflow of the Jordan River.
[1369.46 --> 1372.46]  Bethsaida literally means house of fishing.
[1372.46 --> 1374.46]  It's a fishing village.
[1374.46 --> 1376.46]  And since his friends were Andrew and Peter,
[1376.46 --> 1380.46]  we can deduce that Philip was also likely a fisherman.
[1380.46 --> 1384.46]  Secondly, it seems that Philip is pretty well versed in the Jewish scriptures,
[1384.46 --> 1389.46]  because he tells Nathanael that Jesus was the fulfillment of the law and the prophets.
[1389.46 --> 1393.46]  Thirdly, people, I mean, Philip loved to introduce people to Jesus.
[1393.46 --> 1397.46]  The first thing he does after meeting Jesus, he rushes off to Nathanael and says to him,
[1397.46 --> 1401.46]  Come and see, come and meet this Jesus.
[1401.46 --> 1404.46]  And lastly, here's an icon of Philip on the PowerPoint.
[1404.46 --> 1407.46]  And maybe it's because of his youthfulness.
[1407.46 --> 1410.46]  Maybe it's his passion because he wants to tell everyone he possibly can about Jesus.
[1410.46 --> 1415.46]  But that he's always depicted as a beardless youth.
[1415.46 --> 1420.46]  Nevertheless, that in a nutshell tells you all you need to know about Philip.
[1420.46 --> 1423.46]  He loved to introduce people to Jesus.
[1423.46 --> 1426.46]  In fact, only one person in the New Testament is called an evangelist.
[1426.46 --> 1431.46]  More than 20 people are called apostles, a few as prophets, several as teachers,
[1431.46 --> 1435.46]  but only one person in scripture is called an evangelist.
[1435.46 --> 1437.46]  And that is Philip.
[1437.46 --> 1439.46]  Philip the evangelist.
[1439.46 --> 1444.46]  And you can see his missional eagerness come alive in the story found in Acts chapter 8.
[1444.46 --> 1446.46]  And we're going to pick things up in verse 26.
[1446.46 --> 1448.46]  And it reads like this.
[1448.46 --> 1451.46]  Now, an angel of the Lord said to Philip,
[1451.46 --> 1455.46]  Go south to the road, the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
[1455.46 --> 1456.46]  So he started out.
[1456.46 --> 1462.46]  And on his way, he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kentucky,
[1462.46 --> 1465.46]  which means the queen of the Ethiopians.
[1465.46 --> 1467.46]  This man has gone to Jerusalem to worship.
[1467.46 --> 1471.46]  And on his way home was sitting in his chariot, reading the book of Isaiah, the prophet.
[1471.46 --> 1476.46]  The spirit told Philip, Go to that chariot and stay near it.
[1476.46 --> 1482.46]  Now, earlier in our chapter, Philip is in Samaria doing what he does best, telling people about Jesus.
[1482.46 --> 1485.46]  And because of that, a revival is taking place.
[1485.46 --> 1486.46]  Can you believe it?
[1486.46 --> 1487.46]  Samaritans.
[1487.46 --> 1490.46]  I mean, Jews and Samaritans hated each other.
[1490.46 --> 1495.46]  Tensions were so high that it was customary never to walk through Samaria.
[1495.46 --> 1499.46]  It would always walk around Samaria so you didn't have to set foot in Samaria.
[1499.46 --> 1502.46]  But where do we find Philip?
[1502.46 --> 1504.46]  In the one place you never want to set foot in.
[1504.46 --> 1509.46]  And yet there he is because no one else wants to go there and a revival is taking place.
[1509.46 --> 1510.46]  Come and see.
[1510.46 --> 1512.46]  Come and meet this Jesus.
[1512.46 --> 1517.46]  But one day God shows up and tells Philip to go to, to leave Samaria, sorry,
[1517.46 --> 1520.46]  and go down to the road that leads to Gaza from Jerusalem.
[1520.46 --> 1525.46]  And this is not just any road, but we read that it was a desert or deserted road.
[1525.46 --> 1529.46]  And the Greek word used here for south is the same word for noon.
[1529.46 --> 1535.46]  So God is sending Philip to a desolate place, a desert road under the heat of a scorching noontime sun.
[1535.46 --> 1536.46]  Why?
[1536.46 --> 1539.46]  And who in their right mind would go?
[1539.46 --> 1541.46]  But Philip doesn't complain.
[1541.46 --> 1542.46]  He doesn't need to check his schedule.
[1542.46 --> 1544.46]  He doesn't make any excuses.
[1544.46 --> 1545.46]  He just goes.
[1545.46 --> 1547.46]  And there's a lot to be said for that.
[1547.46 --> 1550.46]  I think there's an important lesson here.
[1550.46 --> 1555.46]  That sometimes God doesn't tell us the third or the fourth or the next step that needs to happen.
[1555.46 --> 1558.46]  He just wants us to step out and to follow him.
[1558.46 --> 1563.46]  And when we get there, when we finish what he tells us to do, then we receive the next step.
[1563.46 --> 1564.46]  And then the next step.
[1564.46 --> 1565.46]  And then the next step.
[1565.46 --> 1568.46]  And we just follow faithfully God and his leading.
[1568.46 --> 1571.46]  God sometimes doesn't give us the big picture.
[1571.46 --> 1573.46]  He just wants us to trust him.
[1573.46 --> 1576.46]  Every step along the way, step by step.
[1576.46 --> 1579.46]  And I think that's what makes the Christian faith so exciting.
[1579.46 --> 1582.46]  You never know what's in store.
[1582.46 --> 1585.46]  But if God says go, you go.
[1585.46 --> 1589.46]  So like Philip, I grew up in a home of faith.
[1589.46 --> 1592.46]  My father, a pastor, had planted a few churches.
[1592.46 --> 1594.46]  And I knew my Bible pretty well.
[1594.46 --> 1597.46]  But in high school, things began to change.
[1597.46 --> 1601.46]  I don't know if I really stopped believing that there was a God.
[1601.46 --> 1604.46]  But I had some serious questions about faith.
[1604.46 --> 1606.46]  About whether it was really real.
[1606.46 --> 1612.46]  For instance, if I wasn't born into the Christian family I was born into, would I actually believe in all of this?
[1612.46 --> 1615.46]  And I certainly didn't live like a Christian.
[1615.46 --> 1620.46]  I remember one time in university, one of my friends and I were talking about getting together to study.
[1620.46 --> 1623.46]  And he said, hey, Al, why don't we study on Sunday morning?
[1623.46 --> 1627.46]  And I said, oh, I can't do Sunday morning because I have to go to church.
[1627.46 --> 1629.46]  And you should have seen the look on his face.
[1629.46 --> 1630.46]  He's like, you?
[1630.46 --> 1631.46]  You go to church?
[1631.46 --> 1633.46]  Are you kidding?
[1633.46 --> 1634.46]  And don't get me wrong.
[1634.46 --> 1635.46]  It's not like I wanted to go to church.
[1635.46 --> 1637.46]  But, you know, I had to save face.
[1637.46 --> 1639.46]  After all, my dad was the pastor.
[1639.46 --> 1644.46]  But looking back, I was pretty much right there and then ready to walk away from Christianity.
[1644.46 --> 1647.46]  But things started to change when I was at 23.
[1647.46 --> 1649.46]  That things started to shift.
[1649.46 --> 1652.46]  I was taking a sociology of religion graduate course.
[1652.46 --> 1655.46]  And that required me to read all the original religious texts.
[1655.46 --> 1659.46]  Like the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and so on.
[1659.46 --> 1663.46]  And in that time, in that year, after reading all of this and reading the Bible,
[1663.46 --> 1670.46]  I came to the conclusion that Christianity didn't not only make sense here in my head, which it did,
[1670.46 --> 1674.46]  but also now intuitively in my heart.
[1674.46 --> 1680.46]  That my faith, not my parents' faith, but Christianity had now become my faith.
[1680.46 --> 1685.46]  And if I took Jesus seriously, that meant that I had to take Jesus' words seriously.
[1685.46 --> 1690.46]  And that meant that when Jesus says, take up your cross and follow me, that is a serious command.
[1690.46 --> 1695.46]  And so, with the confluence of things during that year, I really heard the Spirit say to me,
[1695.46 --> 1698.46]  Albert, you need to drop out of school and go to seminary.
[1698.46 --> 1705.46]  I know, that's a pretty big first ask the Spirit and God was telling me to do.
[1705.46 --> 1710.46]  And I remember telling my parents, hey, Mom and Dad, I'm thinking of actually going to Regent College.
[1710.46 --> 1718.46]  And my dad, Pastor Chu, the other Pastor Chu, the older one, his initial response was, no, you finish your PhD first.
[1718.46 --> 1723.46]  No, my parents came around and they became very supportive.
[1723.46 --> 1728.46]  But it was only after that first step, after saying yes to that first yes,
[1728.46 --> 1731.46]  suddenly everything started coming together.
[1731.46 --> 1735.46]  Someone I didn't know, an elderly widow from Hong Kong who had some money,
[1735.46 --> 1738.46]  I've never met her, decided to pay for all my tuition.
[1738.46 --> 1743.46]  My best friend, I had never talked about it with him, he said, hey, what do you think about us moving to Vancouver?
[1743.46 --> 1746.46]  Someone who I didn't know, another connection, came and said, you know,
[1746.46 --> 1749.46]  we have this empty house in the British properties in West Vancouver.
[1749.46 --> 1751.46]  Do you mind house-sitting it?
[1751.46 --> 1753.46]  Are you kidding me?
[1753.46 --> 1756.46]  One year at Regent became two years, became three.
[1756.46 --> 1762.46]  And it's almost by listening to the Spirit and deciding to act, to surrender, to see what God does, to go,
[1762.46 --> 1765.46]  that God just decided to clear the path.
[1765.46 --> 1771.46]  Now, I wish I had more similar stories like that, especially about getting good stuff for free.
[1771.46 --> 1774.46]  But sometimes the Spirit says something.
[1774.46 --> 1779.46]  And if we are obedient, if we take the first step, God just opens the doors.
[1779.46 --> 1782.46]  He clears the path and he makes it happen.
[1782.46 --> 1785.46]  So, friends, is there something right now?
[1785.46 --> 1790.46]  You sense the Spirit saying to you right now, for you to go and to do.
[1790.46 --> 1794.46]  What is your first step?
[1794.46 --> 1796.46]  Sometimes God doesn't give us the big picture.
[1796.46 --> 1799.46]  He just wants us to trust him step by step.
[1799.46 --> 1801.46]  You never know what's around the corner.
[1801.46 --> 1804.46]  But if God says go, you go.
[1804.46 --> 1807.46]  And that's what Philip does here in our story.
[1807.46 --> 1809.46]  That God says go and Philip goes.
[1809.46 --> 1813.46]  He goes south to this desert road, just waiting for God's next step.
[1813.46 --> 1817.46]  God then shows Philip what he was there for, or better yet, who he's there for.
[1817.46 --> 1820.46]  Hey, Philip, do you see that chariot running or going there?
[1820.46 --> 1822.46]  I want you to run beside it.
[1822.46 --> 1824.46]  I love this part of the story.
[1824.46 --> 1831.46]  So just imagine, this chariot is moving, and Philip has to run next to the chariot in order to talk to the person in the chariot.
[1831.46 --> 1833.46]  So who's in the chariot?
[1833.46 --> 1835.46]  Someone entirely different than Philip.
[1835.46 --> 1840.46]  We discover that it's an Ethiopian eunuch sitting in the chariot and reading through the book of Isaiah.
[1840.46 --> 1844.46]  And in that little short description, we learn a great deal about this man.
[1844.46 --> 1845.46]  Four things.
[1845.46 --> 1847.46]  First, he's an Ethiopian.
[1847.46 --> 1850.46]  So he's African, black, and very far away from home.
[1850.46 --> 1852.46]  So what's he doing there?
[1852.46 --> 1853.46]  Second, he's a eunuch.
[1853.46 --> 1855.46]  That is, someone who's been castrated.
[1855.46 --> 1858.46]  And this is important, and I'll get to this in a little bit.
[1858.46 --> 1860.46]  Thirdly, he's sitting in a chariot.
[1860.46 --> 1863.46]  Well, who had money back then to own a chariot?
[1863.46 --> 1866.46]  So right off, we know that this man must have been incredibly wealthy.
[1866.46 --> 1870.46]  In fact, we discover that he was the minister of finance for the queen of Ethiopia.
[1870.46 --> 1876.46]  And back then, Ethiopia included the area south, the entire area south of Egypt.
[1876.46 --> 1879.46]  So it was a large and powerful nation.
[1879.46 --> 1881.46]  And fourth, he's reading Isaiah.
[1881.46 --> 1883.46]  This man could read.
[1883.46 --> 1886.46]  I mean, hardly anyone could read back then, but this man could read.
[1886.46 --> 1888.46]  So we know he was extremely educated.
[1888.46 --> 1892.46]  He even personally owned his own personal scroll of Isaiah.
[1892.46 --> 1897.46]  I mean, most synagogues had a scroll of Isaiah that they all had to share as a community, as a town.
[1897.46 --> 1900.46]  But this man owned his own scroll.
[1900.46 --> 1907.46]  In short then, this was a rich, powerful, educated, sexually altered African black man.
[1907.46 --> 1909.46]  Pretty much the exact opposite of Philip.
[1909.46 --> 1913.46]  And out of the thousands of Jews and Gentiles and Samaritans that needed Jesus,
[1913.46 --> 1917.46]  God specifically leads Philip to this man.
[1917.46 --> 1918.46]  Why?
[1918.46 --> 1920.46]  And what happens next?
[1920.46 --> 1924.46]  Our story continues in Acts chapter 8, verse 30.
[1924.46 --> 1926.46]  And the first verse reads like this.
[1926.46 --> 1933.46]  Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet.
[1933.46 --> 1935.46]  God's timing, as usual, is perfect.
[1935.46 --> 1940.46]  At that very moment, Philip hears the Ethiopian reading through the book of Isaiah.
[1940.46 --> 1944.46]  The eunuch is reading Isaiah because he is trying to figure out what is going on.
[1944.46 --> 1947.46]  He is likely confused, disheartened, and upset.
[1947.46 --> 1950.46]  He is trying to make a sense of his visit to the temple in Jerusalem.
[1950.46 --> 1953.46]  And I suspect it has not been a good trip.
[1953.46 --> 1955.46]  How do I know that?
[1955.46 --> 1957.46]  Let me explain.
[1957.46 --> 1964.46]  Back in those days, males who were in powerful positions often found themselves needing to castrate themselves.
[1964.46 --> 1967.46]  The reason was because the male royal, or the king for example,
[1967.46 --> 1973.46]  wouldn't allow another male to work closely with him or his family, and especially his wife, the queen that is,
[1973.46 --> 1978.46]  unless they were castrated, because then they would avoid any hanky-panky of any sort.
[1978.46 --> 1983.46]  So, in order to get to the top, you have to become a eunuch.
[1983.46 --> 1986.46]  Well, this man has made it to the top, and he has certainly paid the price.
[1986.46 --> 1991.46]  And maybe it's because of that, that he is now not entirely content with who he is.
[1991.46 --> 1997.46]  After all, how would you explain why this Ethiopian would make such a long, incredibly long journey,
[1997.46 --> 2000.46]  500 miles away from home, to Jerusalem?
[2000.46 --> 2003.46]  Purpose, meaning, direction in life, you can call it whatever you want.
[2003.46 --> 2007.46]  But this man is in serious spiritual search mode.
[2007.46 --> 2009.46]  So just imagine.
[2009.46 --> 2010.46]  He's made this journey.
[2010.46 --> 2013.46]  He's tried to learn as much about this Yahweh God as he can.
[2013.46 --> 2015.46]  He shows up to the temple.
[2015.46 --> 2022.46]  And to his dismay, and to his shock, they do not let him in.
[2022.46 --> 2024.46]  You're not allowed.
[2024.46 --> 2026.46]  You don't belong.
[2026.46 --> 2028.46]  You can't come in.
[2028.46 --> 2035.46]  Because according to our Old Testament laws, your kind, not only your race, but your kind, along with lepers and others,
[2035.46 --> 2040.46]  your kind that has been sexually altered and mutilated, are not allowed in.
[2041.46 --> 2043.46]  And so he's devastated.
[2043.46 --> 2048.46]  And so on his way home, he begins to search through Isaiah to find answers to all this.
[2048.46 --> 2050.46]  And where is he reading in the book of Isaiah?
[2050.46 --> 2053.46]  Later on, we know that he's reading in the 50s, chapter 50-ish.
[2053.46 --> 2056.46]  And specifically in around chapter 53.
[2056.46 --> 2057.46]  Why there?
[2057.46 --> 2059.46]  What is the significance of that?
[2059.46 --> 2062.46]  Because right there, on the same page in that was,
[2062.46 --> 2067.46]  this one passage in Isaiah that actually speaks about foreigners and eunuchs.
[2067.46 --> 2070.46]  And this man is both.
[2070.46 --> 2072.46]  This passage reads, Isaiah 56.
[2072.46 --> 2073.46]  Next slide.
[2073.46 --> 2074.46]  It reads like this.
[2074.46 --> 2078.46]  Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say,
[2078.46 --> 2081.46]  The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.
[2081.46 --> 2083.46]  And let no eunuch complain,
[2083.46 --> 2085.46]  I am only a dry tree.
[2085.46 --> 2087.46]  For this is what the Lord says.
[2087.46 --> 2089.46]  To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
[2089.46 --> 2092.46]  who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant,
[2092.46 --> 2099.46]  To them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name.
[2099.46 --> 2101.46]  Better than sons and daughters,
[2101.46 --> 2105.46]  I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever.
[2105.46 --> 2107.46]  Come on.
[2107.46 --> 2111.46]  Was this passage not written specifically to this man?
[2111.46 --> 2115.46]  In this passage, God is proclaiming hope and deliverance and acceptance
[2115.46 --> 2116.46]  for both eunuchs and foreigners.
[2116.46 --> 2119.46]  And this man is both.
[2119.46 --> 2122.46]  He came to Jerusalem seeking hope, seeking a loving God,
[2122.46 --> 2124.46]  something or someone who would love him,
[2124.46 --> 2125.46]  to accept him,
[2125.46 --> 2127.46]  to fill this void in his life.
[2127.46 --> 2129.46]  Have you ever felt like that?
[2129.46 --> 2131.46]  That regardless of how hard you work,
[2131.46 --> 2132.46]  how successful you become,
[2132.46 --> 2134.46]  how much money you make,
[2134.46 --> 2138.46]  there is still something inherently deeply missing in your lives.
[2138.46 --> 2140.46]  And you feel this emptiness,
[2140.46 --> 2144.46]  and you're missing something or someone who knows you,
[2144.46 --> 2145.46]  who loves you.
[2145.46 --> 2148.46]  And in this passage, Isaiah is saying,
[2148.46 --> 2151.46]  Yes, you belong.
[2151.46 --> 2153.46]  But how?
[2153.46 --> 2155.46]  How is this possible?
[2155.46 --> 2156.46]  How can I belong?
[2156.46 --> 2157.46]  The eunuch asks.
[2157.46 --> 2159.46]  And this is where Philip literally jumps in.
[2159.46 --> 2161.46]  He jumps into the chariot.
[2161.46 --> 2162.46]  We continue on.
[2162.46 --> 2165.46]  Acts again, 8, picking up in verse 30.
[2165.46 --> 2169.46]  Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet.
[2169.46 --> 2171.46]  Do you understand what you are reading?
[2171.46 --> 2172.46]  Philip asked.
[2172.46 --> 2173.46]  How can I?
[2173.46 --> 2175.46]  He said, unless someone explains it to me.
[2175.46 --> 2177.46]  So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
[2177.46 --> 2180.46]  And this is the passage of scripture the eunuch was reading.
[2180.46 --> 2183.46]  He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
[2183.46 --> 2185.46]  and as a lamb before its shearers is silent.
[2185.46 --> 2187.46]  So he did not open his mouth.
[2187.46 --> 2189.46]  In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice.
[2189.46 --> 2191.46]  Who can speak of his descendants?
[2191.46 --> 2193.46]  For his life was taken from the earth.
[2193.46 --> 2194.46]  The eunuch asked Philip,
[2194.46 --> 2197.46]  Tell me, please, who is this prophet talking about,
[2197.46 --> 2198.46]  himself or someone else?
[2198.46 --> 2207.46]  Then Philip began with that very passage of scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
[2207.46 --> 2210.46]  Philip hears the Samaritan reading Isaiah 53,
[2210.46 --> 2215.46]  jumps into the chariot and begins to explain how this passage is dealing with Jesus.
[2215.46 --> 2218.46]  This Jesus who is our substitute, who takes on the sins of humankind,
[2218.46 --> 2222.46]  dies on the cross, and by doing that sets us free.
[2222.46 --> 2226.46]  And right there and then the gospel falls upon this eunuch.
[2226.46 --> 2229.46]  That this Jesus Isaiah is writing about, who became one of us,
[2229.46 --> 2233.46]  who felt what we feel, who took on the injustice and pain of the world,
[2233.46 --> 2236.46]  who was betrayed and crucified, who was cut off.
[2236.46 --> 2241.46]  This Jesus who died and did it in love for you and for me.
[2241.46 --> 2245.46]  And at this point, he commands the chariot to stop.
[2245.46 --> 2248.46]  Here's the conclusion of our story. Verse 36.
[2248.46 --> 2252.46]  As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said,
[2252.46 --> 2256.46]  Look, here's water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?
[2256.46 --> 2258.46]  And he gave orders to stop the chariot.
[2258.46 --> 2262.46]  And then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
[2262.46 --> 2265.46]  And when they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away,
[2265.46 --> 2269.46]  and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
[2269.46 --> 2276.46]  The Ethiopian and Philip get out. They go down to the water, a rare thing in the desert, but God provides.
[2276.46 --> 2278.46]  And right there and then he gets baptized.
[2278.46 --> 2282.46]  And as soon as he comes out of the water, Philip disappears. He vanishes.
[2282.46 --> 2287.46]  And then I love how the story ends.
[2287.46 --> 2294.46]  It reads that the Ethiopian returns home, and he returns home full of joy.
[2294.46 --> 2297.46]  Because that's what the good news does. Joy.
[2297.46 --> 2300.46]  That's a mark of being a disciple. Joy.
[2300.46 --> 2307.46]  And it was out right there and then the gospel is planted in Africa, and it began with this Ethiopian eunuch.
[2307.46 --> 2311.46]  The Ethiopian church is the oldest church on the continent of Africa.
[2311.46 --> 2317.46]  In fact, this is interesting, but according to myth, it is believed that when the early Christians found the Ark of the Covenant,
[2317.46 --> 2323.46]  they needed to hide it and they decided to hide it at the farthest outpost of Christianity at the time, which was Ethiopia.
[2323.46 --> 2327.46]  And specifically in the underground chapel of St. George.
[2327.46 --> 2330.46]  So here is an aerial view of the church. Next slide.
[2330.46 --> 2335.46]  As the Ethiopian Christians, instead of building up, dug down.
[2335.46 --> 2338.46]  They built it in the shape of a cross. Very cool.
[2338.46 --> 2342.46]  And it's believed that the Ark of the Covenant is buried underneath the church.
[2342.46 --> 2348.46]  The gospel came to Africa through this eunuch, and God continues to be at work in Africa.
[2348.46 --> 2355.46]  The African continent has undergone what may be the most dramatic experience of people converting to Christ than any continent in history.
[2355.46 --> 2361.46]  In 1900, it was estimated that there were only about 9 million Christians in Africa.
[2361.46 --> 2365.46]  And in 2000, there were then now 380 million.
[2365.46 --> 2372.46]  That the population of Africa increased from 8% of Christians to 50% Christians in 100 years.
[2372.46 --> 2375.46]  Friends, that's the Holy Spirit at work.
[2375.46 --> 2381.46]  Go to all nations to make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[2381.46 --> 2386.46]  And yet, up to this point, the disciples have actually done a lousy job of it.
[2386.46 --> 2388.46]  Think about it.
[2388.46 --> 2392.46]  That God has had to do some excessive pushing for this to happen.
[2392.46 --> 2399.46]  He has to specifically send his Spirit to get Philip to go to Samaria, and then Philip to go meet this Ethiopian eunuch.
[2399.46 --> 2403.46]  He has to give Peter a dream of unclean animals to get him to go to Cornelius.
[2403.46 --> 2406.46]  God has to send Paul a vision for him to go to Europe.
[2406.46 --> 2414.46]  That the Holy Spirit needed to prod, nudge, and poke the disciples to go and rub shoulders with people different than themselves.
[2414.46 --> 2418.46]  And I think that's exactly what the Holy Spirit has been doing in my life.
[2418.46 --> 2423.46]  Prod, nudge, and poke me to think outside of my comfort zone.
[2423.46 --> 2426.46]  And to be with people who are not like me.
[2426.46 --> 2429.46]  You know, growing up in Alberta, I grew up in the 70's.
[2429.46 --> 2437.46]  And being like the only Asian in school, I certainly received a fair bit of racism.
[2437.46 --> 2442.46]  And you'd think because of my experience, I wouldn't think or act prejudicially.
[2442.46 --> 2445.46]  But I confess, it's there.
[2445.46 --> 2450.46]  I remember grade 6, my friends and I bullying a student that had just recently come from Kenya.
[2450.46 --> 2454.46]  I, who had been bullied, now becomes the bully.
[2454.46 --> 2456.46]  It's not something I am proud of.
[2456.46 --> 2464.46]  And even now, I find myself often basing my decisions on broad sweeping generalizations and preferences.
[2464.46 --> 2467.46]  And I think if we're actually honest with ourselves.
[2467.46 --> 2475.46]  We all unconsciously harbor some preference for some people over others based on things like race, gender, age, or social class.
[2475.46 --> 2479.46]  Much more than we would believe or even acknowledge.
[2479.46 --> 2481.46]  And I don't know what it is.
[2481.46 --> 2485.46]  Whether it's sin, pride, the desire to be special, important, to be part of the gang.
[2485.46 --> 2489.46]  I don't know what it is, but we often make people less than what they are.
[2489.46 --> 2494.46]  We stereotype, we judge, we create names and labels and point the finger at them.
[2494.46 --> 2497.46]  And it's not just about the color of our skin.
[2497.46 --> 2501.46]  That often based on things like education and sexual orientation and religion.
[2501.46 --> 2508.46]  That we think ourselves better and we make people less than who they really are.
[2508.46 --> 2511.46]  And as a result, we stick to our own kind.
[2511.46 --> 2514.46]  I grew up in a monocultural church.
[2514.46 --> 2518.46]  700 people and aside from one interracial marriage, everyone else was Chinese.
[2518.46 --> 2521.46]  And that's a reality in many churches.
[2521.46 --> 2527.46]  You have heard that Sunday morning is actually one of the most racially divided times in North America.
[2527.46 --> 2532.46]  But through the story of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch of Jesus and other stories in the book of Acts
[2532.46 --> 2537.46]  and the Samaritan woman in John 4 and countless other stories, things began to shift for me.
[2537.46 --> 2545.46]  I began to recognize my ethnocentrism and found myself very much desiring to be part of a church
[2545.46 --> 2552.46]  that was ethnically diverse, neighborhood-oriented, and kingdom-focused on things like justice and reconciliation.
[2552.46 --> 2558.46]  As an intern and then a pastor working at different Chinese churches after graduating from Regent,
[2558.46 --> 2562.46]  I really wanted to create a vision of what this church could be.
[2562.46 --> 2567.46]  A diverse, a beautiful, encompassing, welcoming, justice-orientated church.
[2567.46 --> 2573.46]  But every single time I tried to do something, I was met with opposition and pushback.
[2573.46 --> 2575.46]  Even about washroom signs.
[2575.46 --> 2579.46]  For instance, this Chinese church I was working, you walk in the washroom and there's this urinal
[2579.46 --> 2580.46]  and there are these signs.
[2580.46 --> 2583.46]  You have signs in your urinal, by the way, in case you didn't know.
[2583.46 --> 2588.46]  Anyways, in this church you walk and there's these signs above the urinal.
[2588.46 --> 2590.46]  And they would only be written in Chinese.
[2590.46 --> 2595.46]  So, I mean, I can kind of make it out, but does it say to flush or does it say do not flush?
[2595.46 --> 2600.46]  And so when I said, hey, we have neighbors, we have other people coming in that can't write Chinese, read Chinese,
[2600.46 --> 2602.46]  I think we should change the signs.
[2602.46 --> 2605.46]  And my number one response from the pastoral team and the elders was,
[2605.46 --> 2609.46]  there's Albert again, making trouble.
[2609.46 --> 2614.46]  Or when I started making friends with this homeless population that was nearby the church.
[2614.46 --> 2616.46]  I had begun to make relationships.
[2616.46 --> 2617.46]  I invited them to come to church.
[2617.46 --> 2621.46]  And one Sunday as I got up on the pulpit, there were three of them sitting in the black row.
[2621.46 --> 2625.46]  They were there to support me and they had become my friends.
[2625.46 --> 2627.46]  I thought it was fantastic.
[2627.46 --> 2632.46]  And then after the service, an elder came up to me and told me this long convoluted story
[2632.46 --> 2637.46]  about a youth pastor in New York befriended this gang members in New York.
[2637.46 --> 2640.46]  And because of that, the church decided to fire him.
[2640.46 --> 2645.46]  And then the elder said to me, so Albert, you better be careful.
[2645.46 --> 2650.46]  Meaning that I better stop doing what I'm doing or I would be out of a job.
[2650.46 --> 2653.46]  To be honest, it was disheartening.
[2653.46 --> 2656.46]  I didn't know what to do.
[2656.46 --> 2658.46]  So something else happened.
[2658.46 --> 2666.46]  And so when I was approached, you know, by a different kind of church that I, since I couldn't help the Asian church become more inclusive,
[2666.46 --> 2668.46]  I thought, why not the other way around?
[2668.46 --> 2671.46]  And so when a primarily Dutch denomination like the CRC came to me and said,
[2671.46 --> 2673.46]  hey, would you like to plant a church in Richmond?
[2673.46 --> 2674.46]  I said, why not?
[2674.46 --> 2676.46]  And I jumped all over it.
[2676.46 --> 2679.46]  And it was during that time, and trying to think about what kind of church I wanted to create,
[2679.46 --> 2683.46]  I decided that we would need to call it the tapestry.
[2683.46 --> 2686.46]  Because that's what I wanted the church to be.
[2686.46 --> 2693.46]  That we would weave people of diverse background, color, ethnicity, social strata into the fabric of a Christian community.
[2693.46 --> 2695.46]  But are we?
[2695.46 --> 2702.46]  Do we, as the Church of Jesus Christ, whether in Richmond, here in Ladner, in Vancouver, throughout Canada,
[2702.46 --> 2707.46]  do we show the beautiful inclusion and diversity of the gospel?
[2707.46 --> 2711.46]  Do we show the beautiful diversity of God's kingdom?
[2711.46 --> 2713.46]  How can we tell?
[2713.46 --> 2717.46]  I think you can tell, for instance, when we see the picture at the end of this story,
[2717.46 --> 2724.46]  we can tell when we see a poor middle-aged Jewish man putting his arm around a rich, sexually altered black man
[2724.46 --> 2726.46]  and calling him brother.
[2726.46 --> 2729.46]  That's the Spirit of God at work.
[2729.46 --> 2732.46]  That's the gospel message.
[2732.46 --> 2735.46]  So just a quick note about diversity.
[2735.46 --> 2739.46]  When we talk about diversity, we have to talk about diversity across the board.
[2739.46 --> 2743.46]  We've talked a lot this morning about diversity in terms of race and ethnicity.
[2743.46 --> 2746.46]  But when we talk about diversity, it's across the gamut.
[2746.46 --> 2748.46]  I'm talking about intergenerational, about young and old.
[2748.46 --> 2750.46]  It's about people with barriers and disabilities.
[2750.46 --> 2752.46]  It's about social strata.
[2752.46 --> 2755.46]  And I actually think that's the hardest thing that we're working against.
[2755.46 --> 2760.46]  Of welcoming people different in terms of economic structures than us.
[2760.46 --> 2764.46]  Not just the wealthy or middle class of the lower mainland.
[2764.46 --> 2768.46]  But those that are just barely making ends meet.
[2768.46 --> 2775.46]  And I think that's the reason why I connect with Philip so much.
[2775.46 --> 2786.46]  Whether it's about this issue or that issue, I very much desire and hope and pray to have the same posture as Philip.
[2786.46 --> 2788.46]  To be open to the Spirit.
[2788.46 --> 2790.46]  To be willing to be obedient.
[2790.46 --> 2792.46]  To go where I'm comfortable.
[2792.46 --> 2795.46]  And to ultimately trust in God.
[2795.46 --> 2802.46]  Do we trust God enough to know that he knows what he's doing?
[2802.46 --> 2806.46]  Do we trust God enough to trust that he knows what he's doing with his church?
[2806.46 --> 2809.46]  I mean, God sends Philip to this deserted road.
[2809.46 --> 2812.46]  He meets and baptizes this Ethiopian eunuch.
[2812.46 --> 2814.46]  And then just like that, he disappears.
[2814.46 --> 2816.46]  That's the end of the story.
[2816.46 --> 2819.46]  Don't you actually find the ending of the story strange?
[2819.46 --> 2824.46]  Because if it was me, I'd want to make sure the Ethiopian eunuch knew what he was getting himself into.
[2824.46 --> 2828.46]  I'd want to make sure that his message to his friends was theologically sound.
[2828.46 --> 2831.46]  Man, I'd want him to take a baptism class.
[2831.46 --> 2833.46]  But Philip disappears.
[2833.46 --> 2835.46]  And God?
[2835.46 --> 2837.46]  God takes care of it.
[2837.46 --> 2839.46]  He looks after the Ethiopian.
[2839.46 --> 2841.46]  He looks after the African church.
[2841.46 --> 2842.46]  God is in charge.
[2842.46 --> 2844.46]  Do I trust God enough?
[2844.46 --> 2848.46]  Because sometimes it's hard for me to trust God.
[2848.46 --> 2855.46]  In the end, the posture of Philip was ultimately about Jesus.
[2855.46 --> 2859.46]  Whether he was doing life with Nathanael, Samaritans, or the Ethiopian eunuch, it didn't matter who.
[2859.46 --> 2862.46]  It was always about introducing people to Jesus.
[2862.46 --> 2863.46]  Come and see.
[2863.46 --> 2865.46]  Come and meet Jesus.
[2865.46 --> 2868.46]  Because it's Jesus, not issues.
[2868.46 --> 2870.46]  It's Jesus, not politics.
[2870.46 --> 2872.46]  It's Jesus, not preferences.
[2872.46 --> 2874.46]  It's Jesus.
[2874.46 --> 2880.46]  Friends, I pray that this is what the church, I pray that this is what Ladner CRC will be about.
[2880.46 --> 2887.46]  More than good worship, hospitality, good food, diversity, all of that, it's about Jesus.
[2887.46 --> 2889.46]  Come and see.
[2889.46 --> 2891.46]  Come and meet.
[2891.46 --> 2894.46]  And know this Jesus.
[2894.46 --> 2898.46]  Let's pray.
[2898.46 --> 2904.46]  Father God, we live in some strange and surreal times.
[2904.46 --> 2908.46]  A pandemic.
[2908.46 --> 2910.46]  Race riots.
[2910.46 --> 2913.46]  Growing disparity in income.
[2913.46 --> 2914.46]  Injustice.
[2914.46 --> 2916.46]  Tensions.
[2916.46 --> 2921.46]  Fractures among churches and denominations splitting over issues.
[2921.46 --> 2928.46]  I pray in all of this, God, that we would take the posture of Philip.
[2928.46 --> 2931.46]  To be open to the spirit.
[2931.46 --> 2933.46]  To be willing to be obedient.
[2934.46 --> 2936.46]  To go to where we're uncomfortable.
[2936.46 --> 2939.46]  And to ultimately put our trust in you.
[2939.46 --> 2940.46]  To be faithful disciples of Jesus.
[2940.46 --> 2944.46]  That we would be faithful disciples of Jesus.
[2944.46 --> 2952.46]  That ultimately what gathers us, what keeps us, what unites us, is Jesus.
[2952.46 --> 2959.46]  So may we come and know and meet this Jesus for ourselves.
[2959.46 --> 2965.46]  And be willing to go where you have called us to bring others to this Jesus.
[2965.46 --> 2967.46]  In Christ's name I pray.
[2967.46 --> 2968.46]  Amen.
[2968.46 --> 2969.46]  Amen.
[2969.46 --> 2970.46]  Amen.
[2970.46 --> 2971.46]  Amen.
[2992.46 --> 2996.46]  Be my guide, God of Abraham,
[2996.46 --> 3004.98]  You I guide, God of Abraham, lead me by your hand, you are strong and wise.
[3005.98 --> 3014.50]  I want to trust in you, and in all I do, bring you honor and praise.
[3014.50 --> 3034.54]  How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful, through the ages you never changed.
[3034.54 --> 3046.78]  Be my guide in the dark of night, set of fear to flight you, our hope and truth.
[3047.56 --> 3056.38]  I want to trust in you, and in all I do, bring you honor and praise.
[3056.38 --> 3076.44]  How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful, through the ages you never changed.
[3076.44 --> 3088.78]  Be my guide for the road ahead, should I feel misled, you are just and good.
[3089.78 --> 3098.46]  I want to trust in you, and in all I do, bring you honor and praise.
[3098.46 --> 3118.50]  How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful, through the ages you never changed.
[3118.50 --> 3139.36]  How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful, through the ages you never changed.
[3141.70 --> 3144.58]  Our offering today is for Servants Anonymous.
[3144.58 --> 3155.10]  The SA Foundation provides long-term housing, recovery and training for women and their children escaping human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
[3156.00 --> 3163.02]  You can drop off a check, or put it in the mail, and there's also automatic withdrawals that you can do online.
[3163.38 --> 3163.76]  Thank you.
[3163.76 --> 3179.74]  Thank you, Albert, for your appropriate message today, and also the worship team for picking very meaningful song selection.
[3180.38 --> 3183.02]  Let us go to our Lord in our community prayer.
[3183.02 --> 3200.10]  Lord God, Father, we come before your throne of grace with prayers of thanksgiving and prayers of petition.
[3201.08 --> 3205.16]  Even though you know our needs, Lord, you ask us to pour out our hearts to you.
[3206.44 --> 3210.08]  We want to thank you, Lord, for the wonderful weather we've had these last few days.
[3210.08 --> 3215.84]  We can enjoy some vacation time, but also for the farmers who have crops to harvest.
[3216.58 --> 3220.16]  May the harvest be plentiful and keep the workers safe from harm.
[3221.20 --> 3232.96]  May we be responsible with the harvest worldwide, so that those with little or no food may benefit from the plentiful harvest in other parts of the world, including our own.
[3232.96 --> 3235.80]  Lord, be with the world leaders.
[3236.24 --> 3239.18]  May they see this as your world and act accordingly.
[3240.34 --> 3241.86]  Lord, be with local leadership.
[3242.24 --> 3247.38]  We think of the Delta Hospice Society and the pressure they are under to change their code of ethics.
[3248.10 --> 3249.30]  Bless the leadership there.
[3250.78 --> 3258.66]  Here at Ladner CRC, bless the work of Pastor Jason, Pastor Nancy, and the Children Ministry Director, Hannah.
[3258.98 --> 3261.24]  Watch over and keep them and give them wisdom.
[3261.24 --> 3269.40]  Be with our church council and their struggles with how we might be able to worship here in this building somehow and sometime.
[3270.30 --> 3272.68]  Be with them and bless them in their decisions.
[3273.66 --> 3280.82]  Lord, we ask for wisdom for the new immigrant steering committee as they anticipate the arrival of two new families from Egypt.
[3280.82 --> 3286.74]  And this is not too distant future.
[3287.78 --> 3291.02]  With COVID being a real struggle, watch over and keep them.
[3291.52 --> 3295.92]  Be with these families as they transition from Egypt to Ladner.
[3296.44 --> 3297.64]  Watch over and keep them.
[3298.46 --> 3302.14]  There are health issues in our church family as well, Lord.
[3302.14 --> 3309.74]  We ask for prayers for Mel's sister, Kobe, in Red Deer, Alberta, with Kobe in the hospital, seeking help there.
[3310.62 --> 3314.08]  We ask for prayers for those who struggle with cancer.
[3314.72 --> 3317.04]  Tim and his treatment that is not easy on him.
[3318.04 --> 3321.48]  Be with Joan as she does reasonably well and enjoys the summer weather.
[3322.34 --> 3323.24]  Be with Kathy.
[3323.78 --> 3326.18]  Lord, watch over her in her weakened estate.
[3326.18 --> 3333.84]  Lord, we are thankful for Allie as she suffered a mild heart attack and spent some time in the hospital to receive three stints.
[3334.20 --> 3340.24]  And now, back home again, Lord, bless Allie in her senior years as she enjoys her normal life.
[3341.34 --> 3347.00]  Lord, continue to be with Sandy and her children as they adjust to a life without Bill.
[3347.32 --> 3349.34]  And also the grandchildren be with them.
[3349.34 --> 3355.22]  Be especially with Haley and Sarah as they have lost both grandpas in a very short period of time.
[3356.18 --> 3360.50]  Be with Cora as he is now in Surrey Hospital for more care.
[3361.26 --> 3365.56]  Lord, watch over Annie as she has been very steadfast in caring for him.
[3366.88 --> 3372.88]  Lord, as we close this prayer, make us faithful servants of your word and in deed.
[3373.76 --> 3376.40]  Lord, you are faithful and strong.
[3376.96 --> 3380.34]  We should continue to go to you in this week ahead.
[3380.98 --> 3382.38]  In your holy name we pray.
[3383.06 --> 3383.38]  Amen.
[3383.38 --> 3386.80]  We'll ask Albert to give us the blessing.
[3386.96 --> 3388.02]  Send us off with a blessing.
[3395.96 --> 3397.94]  Please receive this as your benediction.
[3399.40 --> 3401.24]  May the rose rise to meet you.
[3401.84 --> 3403.70]  May the wind always be at your back.
[3403.70 --> 3406.56]  May the sun shine warm upon your face.
[3407.20 --> 3409.66]  The rains fall softly upon your fields.
[3410.38 --> 3415.56]  And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his hand.
[3416.46 --> 3416.74]  Amen.
[3416.74 --> 3416.84]  Amen.
[3416.84 --> 3421.56]  Beautiful Savior, king of combs.
[3421.56 --> 3448.66]  Beautiful Savior, King of creation,
[3448.66 --> 3458.66]  Son of God and Son of Man.
[3458.66 --> 3469.66]  Truly I love Thee, truly I serve Thee,
[3469.66 --> 3479.66]  Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
[3479.66 --> 3491.66]  Fair is the sunshine, Fair is the moonlight,
[3491.66 --> 3501.66]  Bright blue sparkling stars on high.
[3501.66 --> 3511.66]  Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer,
[3511.66 --> 3522.66]  Than all the angels in the sky.
[3522.66 --> 3534.66]  Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations,
[3534.66 --> 3544.66]  Son of God and Son of Man.
[3544.66 --> 3554.66]  Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
[3554.66 --> 3566.66]  Now and forevermore be Thou.
[3566.66 --> 3576.66]  Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
[3576.66 --> 3580.66]  And forevermore be Thou.
[3580.66 --> 3584.66]  Amen.
[3584.66 --> 3586.66]  Amen.
[3586.66 --> 3588.66]  Amen.
[3588.66 --> 3590.66]  Amen.
