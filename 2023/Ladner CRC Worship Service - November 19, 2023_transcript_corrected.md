[0.00 → 2.00] you
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[122.00 → 124.00] Amen.
[124.00 → 126.00] Amen.
[126.00 → 128.00] Amen.
[128.00 → 130.00] Amen.
[130.00 → 132.00] Amen.
[134.00 → 136.00] Amen.
[136.00 → 138.00] Amen.
[138.00 → 140.00] Amen.
[140.00 → 142.00] Amen.
[142.00 → 144.00] Amen.
[144.00 → 146.00] Amen.
[146.00 → 148.00] Good morning, everyone.
[148.00 → 151.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[151.00 → 154.00] And I want to extend a warm welcome to you this morning,
[154.00 → 156.00] especially if you are here for the first time
[156.00 → 160.00] or maybe you're joining us after having not come for a while.
[160.00 → 164.00] We are just wanted to extend a special welcome to you.
[164.00 → 169.00] And just before we begin, I have two announcements.
[169.00 → 173.00] And today is Singing Sunday in the sense that right after the service,
[173.00 → 177.00] we will be having choir rehearsals for those who would like to hear
[177.00 → 181.00] who would like to sing on December 24th in the morning.
[181.00 → 185.00] So after the service, we'll be here and we will begin our rehearsals.
[185.00 → 189.00] If you haven't signed up, I'm sure you can still join if you'd like to.
[189.00 → 193.00] After that, we will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[193.00 → 195.00] And so that is at 2.30.
[195.00 → 197.00] You can meet directly there.
[197.00 → 204.00] And it would be wonderful if many could come out and be a blessing to the residents of Mountain View
[204.00 → 209.00] while we sing and share God's word with them.
[209.00 → 217.00] So as most of you will know, last Sunday or sorry, last Saturday was Remembrance Day.
[217.00 → 223.00] And over the years, I have gone to many Remembrance Day ceremonies at my kids' school.
[223.00 → 235.00] And over the years, one of the things that has struck me is just how there's very little new things that are said and done each year.
[235.00 → 238.00] Right? There's very little innovation.
[238.00 → 242.00] There's very little in terms of novelty in what goes on.
[242.00 → 245.00] And that's because that's not what it's about.
[245.00 → 246.00] Right?
[246.00 → 247.00] Right?
[247.00 → 252.00] It's simply to recount and remember the sacrifices that were made for us.
[252.00 → 260.00] And the reason we do that, as we are told over and over, is lest we forget.
[260.00 → 263.00] And I think they're on to something.
[263.00 → 264.00] Right?
[264.00 → 267.00] We do tend to forget.
[267.00 → 269.00] We have amnesia.
[269.00 → 273.00] We forget the things that ultimately were done for us.
[273.00 → 279.00] And the analogy to what we're doing this morning, I think, couldn't be more clear.
[279.00 → 280.00] Right?
[280.00 → 286.00] The fact is that when we gather together for worship, we are here to remember as well.
[286.00 → 297.00] And what we're remembering is that the greatest cure to all evil and all injustice was God's grace revealed to us through his son, Jesus Christ.
[297.00 → 306.00] And so this morning, we are here, and we're going to worship the same way that Christians have been doing for 2,000 years.
[306.00 → 309.00] Without a lot of novelty, without a lot of innovation.
[309.00 → 313.00] Because every Sunday, in a sense, is Remembrance Sunday.
[313.00 → 318.00] It's remembering again and again what Jesus has done for us.
[318.00 → 320.00] And what it means for each one of our lives.
[320.00 → 326.00] So we begin our worship service this morning, as we do every Sunday, with a call to worship.
[326.00 → 335.00] So I want to invite you to join with me in the reading and responding to God's word today from Revelation chapter 5.
[335.00 → 336.00] I'll begin.
[336.00 → 366.00] 
[366.00 → 385.00] Please pray with me as we come before God in a prayer of adoration.
[385.00 → 387.00] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[387.00 → 396.00] Heavenly Father, we come to you this morning as your people with only one thing, which is our need.
[396.00 → 399.00] For you have redeemed our lives from the pit.
[399.00 → 403.00] You have crowned us with steadfast love and mercy.
[403.00 → 406.00] And you satisfy us with every good thing.
[406.00 → 415.00] So thank you, Father, that you did not leave us to ourselves, but you have entered into our world with the only cure possible to save us from evil.
[415.00 → 421.00] You gave up your own son to come and conquer sin and death.
[421.00 → 428.00] And you sent your spirit to open our hearts to receive what he has done for us by faith.
[428.00 → 436.00] We ask you that you would bring all of your wonderful works to our minds and our hearts this morning.
[436.00 → 446.00] That we might praise you again, whether for the first time or for others, for many times that we have done before.
[446.00 → 455.00] And Lord, we praise you for you are the God who was and who is and the God who evermore will be.
[455.00 → 462.00] And it is to you, we come to exalt your name and to sing your praise this morning.
[462.00 → 465.00] Lord, be with us your people.
[465.00 → 468.00] For we come to you through your son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[468.00 → 470.00] And it's in his name that we pray.
[470.00 → 471.00] Amen.
[471.00 → 478.00] Let's all stand together and receive God's greeting to us this morning from Psalm 125.
[478.00 → 486.00] Says this, those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken, but endures forever.
[486.00 → 495.00] As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people, both now and forevermore.
[495.00 → 500.00] So now I want to invite us to turn to one another and greet those around you.
[500.00 → 503.00] Extend Christ's love to one another.
[503.00 → 504.00] Thank you.
[504.00 → 505.00] Thank you.
[533.00 → 537.68] No
[549.00 → 563.00] And
[563.00 → 567.28] my great Redeemer's praise,
[567.28 → 577.78] the glories of my life in the times of His grace.
[578.72 → 583.54] My gracious Master, and my God,
[583.86 → 587.18] assist me to proclaim,
[587.18 → 592.94] to still hold me in the dawn,
[593.22 → 597.74] the honours of Your name.
[598.90 → 603.68] And with all Jesus' hearts of peace,
[604.08 → 608.34] and with all sorrows cease,
[608.96 → 613.60] His music in the sinner's tears,
[613.60 → 619.22] He is life and health and peace.
[620.10 → 625.06] He brings the power of the Son's name,
[625.36 → 629.78] He sets the prisoner free,
[630.22 → 634.80] His blood and the kingdom of the Son's name,
[635.12 → 638.60] His blood and the glory.
[638.60 → 644.48] He wears men and the buy Higher West.
[644.98 → 650.24] His Guy's the eyes and the children and всегда hibernate.
[650.90 → 655.32] And with all your sin now,
[655.56 → 659.24] let us be ready for joy.
[659.24 → 661.24] joy.
[661.24 → 665.24] To the glory
[665.24 → 667.24] risen now,
[667.24 → 669.24] be now
[669.24 → 671.24] and ever
[671.24 → 673.24] be.
[673.24 → 675.24] I say to you
[675.24 → 677.24] blessings of all,
[677.24 → 679.24] the earth
[679.24 → 681.24] and tender
[681.24 → 683.24] and may.

[906.72 → 916.44] So as the children go, later in our service, the sermon passage will be from the Gospel of Luke, Luke chapter 9.
[916.44 → 928.40] And now I just want to read from Luke chapter 4, an earlier passage that I think will also just give some light to who Jesus is and what he came to do.
[928.68 → 934.94] So I'm going to be reading from Luke 4, verses 14 to 30.
[935.54 → 939.62] The scripture will be on the screen, but if you want to open your Bibles, you certainly may.
[940.38 → 944.48] Luke chapter 4, beginning in verse 14.
[946.44 → 954.52] Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
[955.58 → 958.54] He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
[959.62 → 963.02] He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.
[963.74 → 967.06] And on the Sabbath day, he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.
[967.34 → 972.06] He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him.
[972.98 → 975.50] Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written.
[975.50 → 982.82] The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
[983.68 → 989.02] He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners, and recovery of sight for the blind,
[989.48 → 993.90] to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour.
[993.90 → 999.90] Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down.
[1000.54 → 1003.88] The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[1004.98 → 1007.30] He began by saying to them,
[1007.30 → 1011.78] Today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
[1012.68 → 1018.24] All spoke well of him, and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips.
[1018.66 → 1020.74] Isn't this Joseph's son? They asked.
[1021.70 → 1022.60] Jesus said to them,
[1022.72 → 1024.98] Surely you will quote this proverb to me.
[1025.52 → 1026.76] Physician, heal yourself.
[1026.76 → 1029.54] And you will tell me,
[1030.10 → 1033.92] Do here, in your hometown, what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.
[1035.08 → 1036.86] Truly I tell you, he continued,
[1037.32 → 1039.32] No prophet is accepted in his hometown.
[1040.46 → 1044.44] I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time,
[1044.78 → 1047.02] when the sky was shut for three and a half years,
[1047.22 → 1049.48] and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
[1049.48 → 1052.82] Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them,
[1053.24 → 1057.28] but to a widow in Warpath, in the region of Simon.
[1058.50 → 1062.24] And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha, the prophet.
[1063.04 → 1064.80] Yet not one of them was cleansed,
[1065.58 → 1067.34] only Norman, the Syrian.
[1068.44 → 1071.44] All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
[1072.24 → 1074.38] They got up and drove him out of the town,
[1075.26 → 1078.04] took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built,
[1078.04 → 1079.88] in order to throw him off the cliff.
[1080.68 → 1084.06] But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
[1084.56 → 1085.76] This is the word of the Lord.
[1087.60 → 1091.40] You may remain seated as we sing our next song,
[1091.48 → 1093.50] My Soul Longs for the Lord.
[1108.04 → 1113.26] My Soul Longs for the Lord.
[1113.26 → 1117.04] In a weary land.
[1117.60 → 1121.20] Rows are dry, and I am empty.
[1121.76 → 1125.44] Only dust in my hands.
[1125.80 → 1129.56] Now I live for streams of mercy.
[1129.56 → 1133.82] Where my soul will be restored.
[1133.82 → 1138.46] Come and pray, Jesus calls me.
[1138.46 → 1141.18] Thank you, the firstborn.
[1142.46 → 1146.26] Oh, the fullness of Christ.
[1146.66 → 1150.50] Word of God, word of life.
[1150.50 → 1152.02] Lord, Lord.
[1152.02 → 1152.28] Amen.
[1152.28 → 1152.32] O Emmanuel.
[1152.32 → 1153.02] Amen.
[1153.02 → 1153.84] Amen.
[1154.46 → 1154.84] Amen.
[1154.84 → 1155.84] Amen.
[1155.84 → 1156.82] Amen.
[1156.82 → 1158.36] God, God, God.
[1159.36 → 1159.76] Amen.
[1159.76 → 1160.04] 員.
[1160.04 → 1171.96] O Emmanuel, and His spoke into the darkness of the flowers of heaven.
[1171.96 → 1179.96] Praise and mercy flow from Calvary to the glory of He.
[1179.96 → 1187.96] He gives the peace from every sin's death free.
[1187.96 → 1197.96] On the feet we have Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[1197.96 → 1209.96] My soul wants to walk closer, with a little that I stir.
[1209.96 → 1217.96] Fire that reaches, fire that's near, I keep life in your word.
[1217.96 → 1225.96] Turn my gaze from all that's with us, send my heart from its above.
[1225.96 → 1233.96] May my life tell your goodness, your ways of truth and love.
[1233.96 → 1243.96] O the wisdom of Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[1243.96 → 1255.96] My soul wants to walk closer, with a little that I will see your face.
[1255.96 → 1263.96] May your shout of tribulation, no more tears, death, or pain.
[1263.96 → 1267.96] Every word of God's death, every word of God's death.
[1267.96 → 1271.96] Heaven sings in earthly lies.
[1271.96 → 1279.96] To our God be the glory, with hope we share pride.
[1279.96 → 1289.96] Praise and glory to Christ, Word of God, Word of life.
[1289.96 → 1299.96] May your shout of tribulation, no more tears, death, or pain.
[1299.96 → 1301.96] Amen.
[1301.96 → 1307.96] So we come to a time of confession and renewal.
[1307.96 → 1317.96] And for our kind of call to confession, I would like to read for us from Isaiah chapter 5, verses 1 and 2.
[1317.96 → 1319.96] Isaiah 5 is called the song of the vineyard.
[1319.96 → 1327.96] It's a parable about God's people, God's land.
[1327.96 → 1331.96] So I will read it for us, and the words will be on the screen here.
[1331.96 → 1337.96] I will sing for the one I love, a song about his vineyard.
[1337.96 → 1340.96] My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
[1340.96 → 1345.96] He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines.
[1345.96 → 1350.96] He built a watchtower in it and cut out a wine press as well.
[1350.96 → 1358.96] Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.
[1358.96 → 1365.96] And as we read through the story of the scriptures, this is very much the story of Israel.
[1365.96 → 1375.96] God had created Israel to be a light to the nations, to be a priesthood to all the earth,
[1375.96 → 1380.96] and to live in a way that God had created them to live in the land as his people.
[1380.96 → 1384.96] But they time and again failed at that.
[1384.96 → 1388.96] They produced, as Isaiah says, only bad fruit.
[1388.96 → 1396.96] And today, we are God's people, the new Israel, and much like our forebears,
[1396.96 → 1400.96] we often in our lives produce bad fruit.
[1400.96 → 1407.96] And so just taking these words from Isaiah, let's come before the Lord in a time of silent confession,
[1407.96 → 1414.96] confessing just the ways that, you know, when God, he tends us, he cares for us,
[1414.96 → 1421.96] he expects good grapes to grow, and yet sometimes what we yield is bad fruit in our lives.
[1421.96 → 1423.96] So let's come before him in confession.
[1423.96 → 1425.96] So let's come before him in confession.
[1425.96 → 1451.96] And so brothers and sisters, now hear the good news of Jesus Christ.
[1451.96 → 1458.96] And what he has done for us.
[1458.96 → 1464.96] From the words of Jesus, he says, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[1464.96 → 1472.96] If you remain in me, and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[1472.96 → 1473.96] Good fruit.
[1473.96 → 1476.96] That's God's grace to us in our lives.
[1476.96 → 1477.96] Praise be to God.
[1477.96 → 1482.96] Let's stand and let's respond to God's love and mercy, all that he has done for us,
[1482.96 → 1486.96] by singing this song together, I am not my own.
[1486.96 → 1491.96] Let's stand and let's sing to God's love and mercy.
[1491.96 → 1496.96] God's aloud singing, He is with you.
[1496.96 → 1498.96] God, He just loves you.
[1498.96 → 1500.96] God, Son of God, He has done so much love and mercy.
[1500.96 → 1501.96] God loves you, Lord.
[1501.96 → 1505.96] Hissing names, Hissing Pam and Spa their love and mercy.
[1505.96 → 1506.96] It is the only God fulfilled in my life and indeed my death,
[1506.96 → 1511.96] we are the compass all and faith for all my sins and all my sins,
[1511.96 → 1523.42] Even when I struggle to believe, with your precious love you set me free.
[1524.64 → 1535.80] I am not my own, the real love I am so.
[1535.80 → 1548.78] In my life, when we care, to you Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1549.68 → 1555.50] You preserve my life in such a way that without you.
[1556.12 → 1561.46] Lord, you hear me fall from me unless you live in two.
[1561.46 → 1573.80] Even when I'm not in desperation, all can turn together for my salvation.
[1573.80 → 1585.80] I am not my own, but be love, body and soul.
[1586.20 → 1598.20] In my life, and in death, to you Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1598.20 → 1628.18] I am not my own, but be love, body and soul.
[1628.18 → 1636.18] I am not my own, but be love, body and soul.
[1636.18 → 1647.84] In my life, and in death, to you Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1647.84 → 1659.84] I am not my own, but be love, body and soul.
[1659.84 → 1671.84] In my life, and in death, to you Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1671.84 → 1683.84] I am not my own, but be love, body and soul.
[1683.84 → 1688.76] I really love that song.
[1692.84 → 1694.36] So, good morning.
[1694.36 → 1703.40] As many of you will know, over the last couple of months, we have been going through the book of Acts in a sermon series.
[1703.40 → 1711.84] And next week, we will actually be starting our Advent series a week early, but there's lots to say.
[1712.40 → 1714.40] And I'll introduce that next Sunday.
[1714.40 → 1719.06] So, today, I want to do something a little bit different.
[1719.40 → 1728.42] And it's been on my heart to take a Sunday and invite us to consider what has been going on in the Middle East.
[1728.42 → 1740.48] The atrocities that have happened against Israel, and then the response of Israel in Gaza has captured, has sucked all of our attention.
[1741.48 → 1747.64] It has driven a lot of conversation on the news, on social media, in our own social circles.
[1747.64 → 1755.20] And for very good reason, it feels like a very significant time for the state of the world.
[1755.20 → 1762.32] And so, I think it is important for us as a church to be thinking and praying about this as well.
[1763.44 → 1769.06] And the way I want to address it, and I want to be very clear, is not to talk about politics.
[1769.68 → 1772.68] I think the political conversation is important.
[1773.32 → 1777.00] We can talk about it later, but it's not for the pulpit.
[1777.64 → 1785.14] Perhaps, more simply, what I want to do is to look to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1785.82 → 1795.00] To cast our hearts, to cast our hopes on who he is and what he came into our world to do.
[1796.14 → 1804.38] And I think that as we do that, it will shape and inform how we pray about the situation in Israel-Palestine.
[1804.38 → 1808.08] And it will shape what we hope to see happen.
[1809.24 → 1813.98] So today, we look to Jesus, and we say to him, would you teach us?
[1814.92 → 1819.58] And the place we're going to look for him to teach us is in the Gospel of Luke.
[1819.58 → 1826.14] So please open your Bibles to Luke chapter 9, starting in verse 51.
[1826.42 → 1828.06] Luke chapter 9.
[1833.60 → 1839.54] So we will just read a short passage, Luke 9, verses 51 through 256.
[1839.54 → 1843.38] Please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1844.92 → 1852.32] As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
[1853.08 → 1859.56] And he sent messengers on ahead and went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.
[1859.56 → 1864.66] But the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
[1865.48 → 1869.48] When the disciples, James and John, saw this, they asked,
[1870.28 → 1874.44] Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?
[1876.04 → 1879.26] But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
[1880.30 → 1884.36] Then he and his disciples went to another village.
[1885.30 → 1886.76] This is the word of the Lord.
[1887.56 → 1888.60] Thanks be to God.
[1888.60 → 1892.88] Let us pray and ask for God's blessing upon his word.
[1893.36 → 1894.36] Let's pray together.
[1896.86 → 1899.10] Father, we thank you for your word.
[1899.88 → 1905.26] Lord, your word is absolutely true, and you give it to us because you love us.
[1905.86 → 1910.56] And so we ask you this morning that you would apply your word to our minds, that we might know you.
[1911.38 → 1914.38] That you would apply it to our hearts, that we might love you.
[1914.38 → 1918.94] And that you would apply it to our feet, that we might follow you.
[1919.14 → 1922.90] And not just be hearers of your word, but doers also.
[1922.90 → 1928.06] We pray all these things in the precious and powerful name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1928.06 → 1929.06] Amen.
[1929.06 → 1929.12] Amen.
[1929.32 → 1938.14] So this week, preparing for this message, I watched a documentary, which is always a good thing to do.
[1938.14 → 1942.22] It's called One Day After Peace.
[1942.22 → 1943.70] One Day After Peace.
[1943.70 → 1948.32] And the documentary is about these two women, and we'll show a photo of them.
[1948.32 → 1954.66] On the left is a woman named Ray Dalio, and on the right is Busra Away.
[1955.68 → 1959.64] Now, Ray Dalio is an Israeli who grew up in South Africa.
[1960.46 → 1968.66] But in 1967, in reaction to apartheid, she moved with her family to Israel to seek peace there.
[1968.66 → 1990.24] But she wasn't able to escape the hostility because in 2002, nearly 40 years later, her son David, who was a graduate student and a reserve in the military, was killed by a Palestinian sniper who killed 10 people in that shooting.
[1990.24 → 2003.10] Now, that attack and perpetuation of a vicious cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians was to avenge the killing of that man's uncle by an Israeli soldier.
[2005.42 → 2011.98] So Rabbi Hamlin began to seek what it would mean for her to find peace.
[2012.78 → 2015.02] And it led her to all kinds of places.
[2015.02 → 2026.66] But eventually, she found herself seated one afternoon in a group of people who had met together under what is called the Parent Circle Families Forum.
[2027.68 → 2029.84] The Parent Circle Families Forum.
[2030.60 → 2043.02] Now, this is an organization that brings together Israeli and Palestinian mothers and fathers, primarily, who have lost children in the violence of this conflict.
[2043.02 → 2048.04] And so they bring these families together who are bound together by this common tragedy.
[2048.88 → 2054.68] And they sit together around tables and in living rooms, and they talk to each other.
[2055.16 → 2057.92] They tell each other their stories.
[2059.52 → 2061.80] Now, how do you think that feels?
[2063.84 → 2067.54] How stressful are those conversations?
[2068.86 → 2069.06] Right?
[2069.16 → 2069.76] Incredibly.
[2069.76 → 2075.04] And this is where Ray Dalio met Busra Away.
[2075.76 → 2079.94] And Busra Away, this is a Palestinian mother who also lost a child.
[2081.22 → 2085.78] And when they sat down next to each other, Busra, at one point in the conversation, she confessed,
[2086.14 → 2090.98] If I saw the person, the Israeli who killed my son, I would kill him myself.
[2090.98 → 2097.82] And Rabbi looked at her and said, No.
[2098.54 → 2100.96] I know you're angry, but you're not a murderer.
[2101.74 → 2102.92] And neither am I.
[2103.34 → 2104.82] We are sad mothers.
[2106.20 → 2106.30] Right?
[2106.36 → 2107.10] That's what we are.
[2107.10 → 2118.16] So in these meetings, sometimes with anger, but also with many tears, what they would do is that they would just listen to each other's stories.
[2118.16 → 2123.58] They would pass around photos of their slain children.
[2123.58 → 2129.60] And they would just try to grope their way towards healing and peace.
[2130.86 → 2137.86] And now I'm telling you this because it gives us, I believe, a window into our passage this morning.
[2138.58 → 2139.18] Right?
[2139.26 → 2148.58] Before the current conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, there was a similar conflict, not the same, but similar, between Jews and Samaritans.
[2148.58 → 2158.40] And in our passage this morning, we see Jesus come right into the middle of that conflict to bring his salvation.
[2159.94 → 2162.12] And so together, let's walk through our passage this morning.
[2162.56 → 2166.76] And actually, this passage is a turning point in the Gospel of Luke.
[2167.32 → 2170.68] So look with me at verse 51, starting in the beginning of our passage.
[2170.68 → 2172.64] Luke says, he tells us,
[2172.64 → 2181.72] As the time approached for him to be taken up into heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
[2181.92 → 2186.06] The Greek says Jesus set his face toward Jerusalem.
[2187.24 → 2196.42] So up until this point, most of the ministry of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke has been in and around the northern regions of Galilee.
[2196.42 → 2201.60] But now Jesus has resolutely set his face to Jerusalem.
[2201.60 → 2214.68] Now, earlier in the chapter, in Luke chapter 9, Jesus had this discussion with two of the key Old Testament prophets, Moses and Elijah, on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[2215.04 → 2215.14] Right?
[2215.18 → 2216.08] That was pretty cool.
[2216.88 → 2225.32] And they were talking about his departure, which he was going to bring to fulfillment in Jerusalem.
[2225.32 → 2231.88] And what's really fascinating is the Greek word for departure is exodus.
[2233.14 → 2234.40] The exodus, right?
[2234.50 → 2241.82] This is when God miraculously and graciously delivered his people out of slavery in Egypt.
[2241.82 → 2246.28] And he brought them into new life in the promised land.
[2246.28 → 2255.92] The hope of Israel to live free in the land that God had given them is sometimes called the desire for the everlasting hills.
[2256.92 → 2263.36] And it comes from the words of blessing from the patriarch Jacob to his son Joseph.
[2264.20 → 2267.14] And I've always liked that, the desire for the everlasting hills.
[2267.14 → 2275.46] But there was a big gap between what they hoped for and what they were experiencing in their everyday lives.
[2275.96 → 2276.44] Right?
[2276.48 → 2280.90] As an oppressed nation, their land was currently occupied by Rome.
[2281.96 → 2288.14] And so Israel longed and continued to hope for God to establish his kingdom when the Messiah would come.
[2288.14 → 2293.54] And God fulfilled that promise.
[2294.62 → 2297.72] Jesus is the Messiah of God.
[2298.16 → 2300.34] And he came to establish God's kingdom.
[2300.58 → 2303.08] But it was not at all what they were expecting.
[2303.86 → 2308.00] He came to deliver us out of the slavery of sin and death.
[2308.08 → 2313.10] He came to lead us into a new exodus and bring us into a new promised land.
[2313.10 → 2317.82] And everything that keeps us from sharing in the life and the love of God.
[2317.82 → 2319.62] He came to rescue us from all of that.
[2320.78 → 2326.58] But unlike Moses, who led them out of this old exodus, Jesus, he was not just a prophet.
[2326.80 → 2327.88] He was God himself.
[2328.16 → 2329.60] He was God with us.
[2329.94 → 2332.40] And he came to us to save his people.
[2333.84 → 2341.48] And so every step that Jesus takes from here on out in Luke's gospel is towards Jerusalem and towards the cross.
[2341.48 → 2348.48] He came to do God's will, which was to deliver the world out of its bondage.
[2349.44 → 2352.44] And he had to be in Jerusalem.
[2353.64 → 2355.40] Luke wants us to take note of that.
[2356.24 → 2358.92] So let's keep reading in our passage, verse 52.
[2358.92 → 2366.70] And he sent messengers on ahead who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.
[2367.40 → 2374.16] But the people there did not welcome him because he was heading for Jerusalem.
[2374.16 → 2385.26] Now for Jesus to get to his goal of Jerusalem from Galilee down south into Jerusalem, the quickest way is to go through Samaria.
[2386.02 → 2393.26] But the people in the Samaritan villages, they did not welcome him because it tells us he was going to Jerusalem.
[2393.26 → 2396.40] In other words, they knew he was a Jewish pilgrim.
[2396.40 → 2402.56] They showed hostility to him, in other words, because he was a Jew.
[2403.82 → 2413.42] Now the ancient historian Josephus, he tells us that Samaritans would often make it very difficult for these Jewish pilgrims to pass through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem.
[2414.04 → 2416.76] Even murdering pilgrims on occasion.
[2418.74 → 2419.34] Why?
[2419.58 → 2420.76] What's going on here?
[2421.16 → 2422.62] Why this hostility?
[2422.62 → 2428.80] Well, historically, there was an intense conflict between Jews and Samaritans.
[2429.06 → 2431.94] It involved different religious views.
[2432.34 → 2435.64] It also involved ethnic prejudice against one another.
[2436.74 → 2440.96] It all started back in the 8th century before Christ.
[2441.50 → 2448.02] When the northern kingdom of Assyria, sorry, the northern kingdom of Israel fell to Assyria.
[2448.02 → 2455.20] And the survivors of that invasion were exiled to the farthest reaches of the Assyrian Empire.
[2456.28 → 2459.96] And Assyrian settlers were brought to Samaria.
[2460.60 → 2469.42] And they intermarried with the people who were still left in the land, resulting in a mixed race of people, later known as the Samaritans.
[2469.42 → 2478.12] Now, 200 years later, in 586 BC, the southern kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians.
[2478.60 → 2481.58] And many of the people were taken into exile into Babylon.
[2482.66 → 2485.72] Later, the Babylonian kingdom fell to the Persians.
[2486.38 → 2493.50] And then Cyrus, the king of Persia, he allowed the exiles from Judah, who were in Babylon, to return to Jerusalem.
[2493.50 → 2498.02] And then they began to rebuild the temple, to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
[2499.54 → 2504.04] Those returning to rebuild were now called the Jews.
[2505.06 → 2514.44] Now, the Samaritans, because of still a sense of solidarity with them, even though it's been hundreds of years and a lot of conflict in between,
[2515.10 → 2517.00] they offered to help rebuild the temple.
[2517.00 → 2523.80] But the Jews, because of ethnic prejudice, rejected their offer.
[2524.88 → 2527.24] So the Samaritans, they decided they're going to build their own temple.
[2527.74 → 2530.08] And they did it on Mount Gorizia in Samaria.
[2531.90 → 2536.86] Now, if you remember this famous story when Jesus met the Samaritan woman, right?
[2536.94 → 2542.40] And he came, and he asked her for a drink of water in John chapter 4, verse 9.
[2542.40 → 2546.22] This is what, what did this woman say to Jesus?
[2547.00 → 2550.58] You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman.
[2550.70 → 2552.38] How can you ask me for a drink?
[2553.58 → 2556.16] And Luke adds in this comment,
[2556.72 → 2561.20] four Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
[2563.02 → 2563.76] Right?
[2563.82 → 2571.02] And behind that comment is hundreds of years of history of conflict and violence.
[2571.02 → 2582.94] And a picture for us, it's not perfect, but if you can imagine how we might feel opening our homes to a Muslim guest who is on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
[2584.62 → 2589.24] If we did that, we would be very aware of our differences.
[2589.24 → 2592.70] But hopefully we would still offer hospitality.
[2594.20 → 2601.44] But because of this animosity, even though it was much quicker to go through Samaria, most Jewish pilgrims would go around.
[2601.54 → 2603.78] They would go along by the Mediterranean Sea.
[2603.90 → 2612.34] They would go along by the Jordan River to avoid the conflict, even though it would take many more days on the journey.
[2612.34 → 2619.58] And so, it says a lot, don't you think, that Jesus, what did Jesus do?
[2620.24 → 2621.48] He doesn't take a detour.
[2622.22 → 2624.86] He doesn't go around Samaria like everyone else.
[2625.00 → 2627.58] He goes straight through Samaria.
[2627.58 → 2638.62] He always travelled through Samaria to meet with the Samaritan people, to talk to the Samaritan people, to eat and visit with the Samaritan people.
[2641.32 → 2643.02] I find that so amazing.
[2645.34 → 2651.52] But the lack of welcome made two of his disciples furious.
[2651.52 → 2662.04] So, verse 54 says, when the disciples, James and John, saw this, they asked, Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them?
[2663.76 → 2668.48] James and John, right, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus gives them a nickname.
[2668.68 → 2669.58] Do you remember what it is?
[2671.02 → 2672.10] Sons of Thunder.
[2672.72 → 2675.36] It's a great nickname, except for it's not.
[2677.68 → 2681.06] They're not surprised that the Samaritans rejected Jesus.
[2682.30 → 2689.50] And this experience now only reaffirms the prejudice that they have toward the Samaritans.
[2690.24 → 2701.26] And in their zeal, they wanted to call down judgment on the Samaritans, like the destruction that God had brought once upon a time on the prophets of Baal in the time of Elijah.
[2703.32 → 2709.88] And this response, as much as anything, it reveals just how much the Jews and the Samaritans hated each other.
[2709.88 → 2712.72] And both wanted to destroy each other.
[2713.06 → 2716.18] Both wanted fire to come down from heaven to destroy the other.
[2717.40 → 2719.00] So now let me ask you a question.
[2719.98 → 2721.16] Does this sound familiar?
[2721.16 → 2727.22] Do you think some people are asking God the same question today?
[2728.74 → 2736.88] Whether it's on the news, whether it's on social media, are people saying, Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them?
[2736.88 → 2755.62] Just like in Jesus' day between the Jews and Samaritans, today you have hostility between Israelis and Palestinians, who also see each other with ethnic prejudice and religious difference, fuelled by years and decades of violence and hostility.
[2755.62 → 2759.28] So how did Jesus respond?
[2761.16 → 2763.04] What would Jesus have us do?
[2764.42 → 2766.98] Luke tells us in verse 55.
[2768.38 → 2771.46] But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
[2773.40 → 2775.28] What does it mean to rebuke someone?
[2776.66 → 2778.02] It's to say no.
[2779.10 → 2779.58] No.
[2779.58 → 2784.94] What you're saying, what you're thinking, what you're doing, your attitude, it is not right.
[2787.10 → 2788.22] He rebuked them.
[2789.32 → 2792.82] And what we see here is that the disciples, they still don't get it.
[2793.94 → 2794.06] Right?
[2794.14 → 2799.20] Jesus did not come to remove non-Jewish people from the land and to set up an earthly kingdom.
[2799.36 → 2800.26] That's not what he came to do.
[2801.60 → 2804.04] And the time for judgment had not yet come.
[2804.04 → 2808.26] Jesus did not come to rain down fire on people who reject him.
[2809.16 → 2809.28] Right?
[2809.36 → 2813.14] Yes, he will come in judgment at the end of time when he returns.
[2813.46 → 2816.70] But his first appearing, Jesus came to heal.
[2817.12 → 2823.54] He came to bring salvation through his rejection, through dying for his enemies.
[2824.72 → 2828.36] It's so upside down to our way of thinking.
[2829.12 → 2831.08] It's so hard for us to understand.
[2831.28 → 2832.60] It's hard for us to accept.
[2832.60 → 2834.46] In fact, it's scandalous.
[2835.96 → 2837.78] But it is the way of Jesus.
[2839.50 → 2843.78] You know, the Samaritans, they had no idea that Jesus was actually on the way to Jerusalem
[2843.78 → 2846.18] to save even them.
[2846.90 → 2847.38] Right?
[2847.44 → 2849.20] To save Jews and Samaritans.
[2849.36 → 2854.30] To reconcile both of them to God and to one another in his eternal kingdom.
[2855.22 → 2856.54] Through Jesus Christ.
[2856.54 → 2863.50] Now, in the book of Acts, we read the ending of this story that we have here in Luke.
[2864.30 → 2864.52] Right?
[2864.58 → 2871.22] After Jesus rebukes the disciples, Luke writes in verse 56, then he and his disciples, they
[2871.22 → 2872.20] went to another village.
[2873.18 → 2875.60] And then the narrative continues.
[2876.24 → 2880.26] But Luke actually picks up the story, in a sense, in the book of Acts.
[2880.26 → 2886.60] In Acts chapter 8, we read about how this one deacon named Philip went to the Samaritan village.
[2886.60 → 2888.38] He proclaimed the gospel.
[2888.72 → 2889.24] Right?
[2889.32 → 2892.44] The good news of Jesus Christ and his love for them.
[2893.44 → 2897.40] In the Samaritan village, it accepted Jesus.
[2898.06 → 2898.46] Right?
[2898.46 → 2903.88] The first time, they wouldn't welcome him as a Jewish pilgrim passing through on his way
[2903.88 → 2904.42] to Jerusalem.
[2905.00 → 2911.80] But when they heard what Jesus had done for them, realizing that they are his enemies,
[2912.04 → 2913.56] they didn't deserve his grace.
[2914.56 → 2918.32] But when they heard the gospel, they welcomed him in their hearts.
[2918.60 → 2919.44] They believed in him.
[2921.08 → 2923.46] And so, how did the story end?
[2924.46 → 2926.14] Did fire come down from heaven?
[2926.14 → 2928.90] Yes and no.
[2930.20 → 2934.34] Fire came down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, didn't it?
[2935.22 → 2937.42] But it wasn't fire that came to destroy.
[2938.02 → 2941.54] It was the Holy Spirit who came to ignite love.
[2942.74 → 2947.64] And the Samaritans, they needed to receive that same Holy Spirit that had come upon the
[2947.64 → 2948.72] Jews at Pentecost.
[2949.68 → 2953.48] And guess who they sent to the Samaritans?
[2955.32 → 2955.80] John.
[2956.14 → 2962.54] The son of thunder who wanted God to send fire down from heaven to destroy them.
[2963.30 → 2966.48] And so, look at Acts chapter 8 verse 14.
[2967.76 → 2968.52] It says,
[2968.52 → 2987.14] Friends, do you see what Jesus did?
[2987.14 → 2988.48] What he did here.
[2988.48 → 2991.62] He transformed these people.
[2991.94 → 2993.88] He transformed John.
[2994.42 → 3001.48] He transformed the Samaritans to instead of fighting and trying to destroy each other into becoming
[3001.48 → 3005.08] one body and loving each other.
[3005.08 → 3006.08] Right?
[3006.08 → 3006.64] Right?
[3006.64 → 3010.46] Because Jesus came not to destroy the people.
[3011.48 → 3013.32] He came to destroy their hostility.
[3014.52 → 3023.40] And he did send fire from heaven, but it was the fire of the Spirit who came to unite them to one another through Christ,
[3024.06 → 3025.30] through what Jesus came to do.
[3025.30 → 3031.28] Paul tells us in Ephesians chapter 2 that Jesus tore down the separation wall.
[3031.28 → 3037.18] And he reconciled both sides to God so that they can be reconciled to each other.
[3038.18 → 3038.72] Right?
[3038.72 → 3042.48] That Jesus came to lead us into a new exodus to deliver his people.
[3042.48 → 3045.38] People now from every nation.
[3045.50 → 3046.40] The new Israel.
[3046.78 → 3052.40] Not to bring them into a physical kingdom, but into his everlasting kingdom.
[3052.40 → 3054.40] That is the story of the Bible.
[3054.40 → 3057.50] And the horizon of that story is Jesus Christ.
[3059.50 → 3066.40] So in that documentary, One Day After Peace, where we met these two women, Robbie Devlin and Busra Away,
[3067.28 → 3071.36] as you watch this thing, they meet for the first time.
[3072.54 → 3074.50] And that's hard to watch, actually.
[3075.96 → 3077.96] It's challenging to watch.
[3077.96 → 3084.80] Because for so long, they had viewed each other through the lens of hatred.
[3086.34 → 3086.86] Right?
[3086.92 → 3091.52] And they were struggling to move towards one another in forgiveness and love.
[3092.02 → 3094.80] And the struggle, again, it took many different forms.
[3094.98 → 3096.24] It took the form of listening.
[3096.88 → 3098.18] Listening to one another's stories.
[3098.88 → 3105.26] It took the form of bearing accusation and insult from the other.
[3105.26 → 3107.76] It took the form of crying.
[3108.06 → 3110.24] And it took the form of looking at photographs.
[3112.26 → 3116.72] Eventually, it took the form of eating in one another's homes.
[3116.86 → 3120.42] Opening their homes to hospitality to one another.
[3121.70 → 3123.16] Israelis and Palestinians.
[3123.88 → 3125.16] Speaking words of love.
[3126.42 → 3127.42] Hugging one another.
[3129.02 → 3134.20] But, you know, of all these different forms of love and reconciliation that we see throughout this documentary,
[3134.20 → 3136.24] one of the most poignant was this.
[3136.84 → 3142.38] It was when Robbie and Busra, they're lying next to each other on these medical tables.
[3143.38 → 3145.02] And they're looking at each other.
[3145.06 → 3146.56] And their arms are kind of out like this.
[3146.60 → 3151.12] And they have needles in their veins with tubes connected to these little bags.
[3152.24 → 3156.70] And blood is running out of their veins through these tubes.
[3156.70 → 3159.44] And so here's a photo.
[3161.22 → 3162.96] Well, that's not Robbie, obviously.
[3163.14 → 3165.58] But there are some other guys as well.
[3165.66 → 3166.32] Some of the fathers.
[3167.52 → 3174.42] And so what they're doing is this family circle, parent circle, they partnered with a medical organization called Blood Relations.
[3174.42 → 3179.32] And which Israelis and Palestinians donate blood to each other.
[3180.66 → 3188.06] And these mothers and these fathers, as they lie there next to each other, and they let the blood run out of their bodies,
[3189.06 → 3193.36] just like it did of their slain children.
[3193.36 → 3196.60] But now that blood is not just spilt.
[3196.74 → 3197.56] It's gathered.
[3198.24 → 3200.56] And it's given to one another.
[3202.10 → 3203.22] And then here's this other photo.
[3204.02 → 3206.14] The scene then cuts to Robbie and Busra.
[3206.20 → 3209.00] They're standing outside the medical clinic, hugging each other.
[3209.12 → 3211.92] And they're wearing these t-shirts, like this one.
[3212.04 → 3213.60] And it says on the back,
[3213.60 → 3217.98] Could you hurt someone who has your blood running through their veins?
[3219.74 → 3223.60] Could you hurt someone who has your blood running through their veins?
[3225.76 → 3230.72] No, friends, Jesus didn't come to send fire down from heaven to hurt his enemies.
[3232.00 → 3233.56] And that would be all of us.
[3234.28 → 3236.58] All of us have sinned against him.
[3237.58 → 3242.24] But he came to shed his own blood for his enemies.
[3242.24 → 3246.26] So that his blood would, in a sense, run through our veins.
[3246.66 → 3249.76] And so that he could adopt us into his family.
[3251.48 → 3254.94] In Christ, all who put their faith in him are covered by his blood.
[3255.92 → 3256.98] They are forgiven.
[3257.10 → 3260.08] They are set free from every sin and bondage.
[3260.72 → 3263.50] Every act of violence that they have done or was done toward them.
[3264.70 → 3269.72] And, friends, that is the basis for unity and peace in the world.
[3269.72 → 3272.96] Jesus unites us together in his body, the church.
[3274.88 → 3277.60] And so as we conclude, what should be our response?
[3278.44 → 3281.02] How should we as Christians stand in this conflict?
[3281.80 → 3283.36] And there are many things we could say.
[3283.46 → 3288.22] But I just want to simply remind us of the two most basic.
[3288.22 → 3294.38] And this is something we should think about, maybe we should talk about around our own tables.
[3294.96 → 3298.14] And the first is this, is the call to love our enemies.
[3299.72 → 3299.96] Right?
[3300.02 → 3305.56] Whatever your political views might be, whatever your own solution for peace in the Middle East,
[3306.46 → 3309.88] whatever your theological views of the land of the Jews,
[3311.60 → 3315.14] Christians are called to be those who love our enemies.
[3315.14 → 3316.32] That's basic.
[3317.38 → 3325.18] And what we need to see in this passage is Jesus most certainly did not come to affirm prejudice and hostility between ethnic peoples.
[3326.14 → 3326.70] Right?
[3326.76 → 3330.54] There's no place for racism in any form or shape in the kingdom of God.
[3331.62 → 3334.24] And without the spirit of love for our enemies,
[3334.24 → 3337.96] we will simply continue to perpetuate violence against one another,
[3338.40 → 3340.42] justifying things that ought not to be justified.
[3340.42 → 3346.14] And as followers of Christ, we should do exactly as Jesus himself did,
[3346.28 → 3347.72] which is to show God's love,
[3348.42 → 3350.56] to show God's grace to his enemies,
[3350.98 → 3352.96] and await the day of real judgment,
[3353.62 → 3358.98] when righteousness will be brought by the only all-seeing and all-knowing judge.
[3360.00 → 3361.54] And that is God, and that is not us.
[3363.40 → 3364.84] So we need to love our enemies.
[3364.84 → 3369.46] Second, also pretty, hopefully non-controversial,
[3371.20 → 3373.56] Christians are called to be those who are committed to peacemaking.
[3374.70 → 3375.20] Right?
[3375.28 → 3378.70] As Christians, we must unapologetically advocate for peace.
[3379.78 → 3384.34] We are to be Christ's agents of peace in this world.
[3385.68 → 3386.16] Right?
[3386.22 → 3388.86] Because in spite of all the divisions of the world,
[3388.94 → 3390.98] in spite of the horrible things that happen in our world,
[3390.98 → 3398.16] the Christian church continues to confess that it is in Jesus Christ that peace can truly happen.
[3399.28 → 3403.92] And so what we need to do is we pray for people to come to know Jesus.
[3404.84 → 3408.80] Because when they come to know Jesus, they will come to know peace.
[3410.20 → 3410.64] Right?
[3410.72 → 3412.72] Because when you believe that Jesus loves you,
[3412.84 → 3415.04] that he died for you,
[3415.10 → 3416.40] he laid down his life for you,
[3416.42 → 3417.88] if you dare to follow him,
[3417.88 → 3420.50] you'll get caught up in the goodness of God.
[3421.30 → 3425.78] And you will bless others as well as Jesus did.
[3427.26 → 3427.50] Okay?
[3427.84 → 3429.66] So, loving our enemies,
[3429.92 → 3430.98] being committed to peacemaking,
[3431.44 → 3433.20] praying for people to know Jesus.
[3433.82 → 3434.48] So let's pray.
[3434.66 → 3436.86] Let's ask God to help us.
[3436.98 → 3437.56] Let's pray together.
[3439.64 → 3442.70] And I'm going to pray using the words of the Book of Common Prayer.
[3442.70 → 3449.16] O God of unchangeable power and eternal light,
[3449.88 → 3452.60] look favourably on your whole church,
[3453.10 → 3455.40] that wonderful and sacred mystery.
[3456.36 → 3458.62] By the effectual working of your providence,
[3458.90 → 3461.70] carry out in tranquility the plan of salvation.
[3461.70 → 3466.64] Let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down
[3466.64 → 3468.10] are being raised up,
[3468.92 → 3472.08] and things which had grown old are being made new,
[3472.66 → 3475.44] and that all things are being brought to their perfection
[3475.44 → 3478.56] by him through whom all things were made,
[3479.24 → 3482.00] your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,
[3482.40 → 3484.14] who lives and reigns with you
[3484.14 → 3486.04] in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
[3486.04 → 3487.16] one God,
[3487.48 → 3488.40] forever and ever.
[3488.96 → 3489.32] Amen.
[3492.02 → 3493.16] So let's stand,
[3493.46 → 3495.12] and as the worship team comes up,
[3495.22 → 3497.84] we'll sing our song of response together.
[3497.98 → 3499.12] Please stand, and we'll sing together.
[3516.04 → 3528.26] Dear govern of things,
[3528.26 → 3530.10] Dear God,
[3530.10 → 3530.80] so won't long.
[3530.80 → 3531.46] Amen.
[3535.22 → 3536.94] Dear God,
[3537.22 → 3538.26] I'm going to be a
[3538.26 → 3538.84] if you are running.
[3538.90 → 3540.56] 怪 out of things like teamed the world.
[3540.56 → 3541.84] in the happy room,
[3541.84 → 3541.98] Italy,
[3542.24 → 3544.02] yes,
[3544.22 → 3546.02] lucky Hu chest.
[3546.02 → 3549.18] I say, rejoice.
[3552.00 → 3556.06] His kingdom cannot live,
[3556.06 → 3560.28] it rules no more than heaven.
[3560.74 → 3563.86] At ease of death and death,
[3563.86 → 3568.28] to Christ the Lord our King.
[3569.10 → 3572.06] Lift your heart,
[3573.34 → 3575.44] lift your voice,
[3575.44 → 3578.20] rejoice, O dear Christ,
[3578.20 → 3581.70] I say, rejoice.
[3583.44 → 3586.20] Rejoice in glory,
[3586.20 → 3591.64] for Christ the Church of God.
[3592.42 → 3595.76] Together all His saints
[3595.76 → 3600.44] to the region of all.
[3600.44 → 3604.44] He soon shall live,
[3604.44 → 3608.58] our nations will come,
[3608.58 → 3610.70] our nations will come,
[3610.70 → 3612.70] shall rejoice.
[3612.70 → 3614.70] Rejoice.
[3614.70 → 3631.22] So the response to God's grace is always,
[3631.96 → 3633.34] when we see it clearly,
[3633.80 → 3634.80] and we receive it truly,
[3634.80 → 3636.02] it's a response of gratitude.
[3636.86 → 3638.04] It's to say thank you,
[3638.10 → 3639.86] you know, thank you for doing for us
[3639.86 → 3641.74] what we could not do for ourselves.
[3641.74 → 3644.84] And one of the ways that we express that
[3644.84 → 3646.06] in our worship service
[3646.06 → 3647.42] is simply by giving back
[3647.42 → 3649.58] of those things that we recognize
[3649.58 → 3652.08] came from God and that God has given us.
[3653.34 → 3655.86] And so this is what we call our offering,
[3655.98 → 3657.18] the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3657.46 → 3658.40] And so can I invite,
[3659.14 → 3660.40] ask our deacons to come forward
[3660.40 → 3661.82] and to pass around the bags.
[3661.82 → 3665.22] If you are new or not regularly worshipping with us,
[3665.32 → 3667.58] please do not feel obligated to give.
[3668.64 → 3670.18] Today's ministry or offering
[3670.18 → 3673.54] is for the Seafarers Literature Fund Ministry.
[3673.54 → 3679.40] Seafarers Literature Fund Sherlock with
[3679.40 → 3684.52] A Power of Dr. John
[3684.52 → 3688.80] Silent Zion
[3688.80 → 3718.78] Thank you.
[3718.80 → 3748.78] Thank you.
[3748.80 → 3778.78] Thank you.
[3778.80 → 3808.78] Thank you.
[3808.80 → 3838.78] Thank you.
[3838.78 → 3840.78] Thank you.
[3840.78 → 3845.58] too confusing. Nathan and Noah, they were born on Wednesday morning and
[3845.58 → 3851.94] congratulations to the great-grandparents Martin and Angela and also
[3851.94 → 3861.96] now grandparents Perry and sorry Martin and Ann, Perry and Angela. Okay.
[3861.96 → 3873.48] All right, let's go before the Lord in prayer. Our Heavenly Father, you are our
[3873.48 → 3880.38] strength in our song. You have become our salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3880.38 → 3887.16] You are glorious in power. You have shattered our enemies of sin and death.
[3887.16 → 3893.14] Who is like you, O Lord, in the heavens above or on the earth? There is none
[3893.14 → 3897.60] like you, O God. You are majestic in holiness. You are awesome in wonders. Furthermore, you
[3897.60 → 3905.22] are glorious in all of your deeds. You break the bow. Furthermore, you shatter the spear. And
[3905.22 → 3910.50] you also lead us faithfully in steadfast love. You have redeemed us from the pit
[3910.50 → 3918.12] and called us to bear your light in a dark world. Lord, we acknowledge and
[3918.12 → 3923.54] confess that so often we let our differences, big and small, make wedges
[3923.54 → 3933.32] between us in this world. We often adopt this us versus them mentality everywhere.
[3933.32 → 3942.36] And Lord, we often get sucked into propagating more division instead of unity. We easily forget
[3942.36 → 3948.24] how much you loved us and how you taught us to love our neighbours. Lord, help us to repent
[3948.24 → 3955.02] of these things. Remind us that we are poor and needy and that we cannot love others without
[3955.02 → 3964.74] your grace upon us. And Lord, just being mindful of what we have been talking about today, we
[3964.74 → 3970.62] pray for the end of all wars. Lord, you are the Prince of Peace. You are the creator of
[3970.62 → 3977.02] peace through the blood of your son Jesus. And there is no peace without you. And so we
[3977.02 → 3983.30] pray, O Lord, for peace in Israel and peace in Palestine. Peace for the Jews. Peace for the
[3983.30 → 3989.68] Arabs. We need your peace, Lord, in our world. And so we pray for more people to know you.
[3989.68 → 3996.12] Would both Jews and Palestinians come to know our Saviour Jesus so that they would come to
[3996.12 → 4004.24] know true peace? We thank you that one day we get to look forward to the end of all war,
[4004.24 → 4012.62] when you will return to renew and heal all things. We thank you that we can rest knowing
[4012.62 → 4022.14] that you have already won the ultimate battle. And Father, you instruct us to pray for those who
[4022.14 → 4030.94] are in authority for all our leaders. And so we pray for government and military leaders in Israel.
[4031.94 → 4038.04] We pray for leaders in Palestine. We pray for leaders in our country of Canada,
[4038.04 → 4043.96] in the United States, in the United States, and leaders of the world. Lord, would you give them
[4043.96 → 4048.92] wisdom from above to find a path towards peace and reconciliation.
[4051.08 → 4057.82] And Lord, we pray against all the forces of hell and darkness. We pray for you to put an end to evil
[4057.82 → 4065.50] and violence and hatred and destruction between human beings whom you have created in your image.
[4067.10 → 4074.38] The Bible says that the devil wants to kill and destroy. But Jesus said, I came so that they may have
[4074.38 → 4084.14] life and life abundant. Lastly, Lord, we first, we give you great praise, and thanks for the birth of
[4084.14 → 4092.94] Nathan and Noah. Lord, for a healthy delivery. And Lord, we pray for their continued development.
[4092.94 → 4101.74] And most of all, Lord, that they would come to know you. And Lord, help us to care and love for them,
[4101.74 → 4110.70] along with Lorna and Kenny. And Lord, we also lift to you for your care, especially this morning,
[4110.70 → 4120.70] Lord, Ted and Allie and Tony, Tonya. Lord, we pray for Tony, who now can't drive and is at home and
[4120.70 → 4129.02] is facing some hardships. Lord, would you help her and be with her? Lord, we pray for Ted as he's in
[4129.02 → 4137.02] the White Rock Hospital in the long-term care facility waiting for, to go into a different long-term
[4137.02 → 4141.74] care place, Lord. And we pray that you provide the right placement for him. And Lord, would you
[4142.62 → 4149.42] be with him, come around him, Lord, with your peace and presence. Lord, we pray for Allie in
[4150.22 → 4156.46] these days of real medical struggle. Lord, we pray that you would
[4156.46 → 4167.18] Lord, help her not to, Lord, experience too much pain. And Lord, that she would, by your grace and help,
[4167.18 → 4174.86] Lord, rest in your everlasting care. Lord, would she cast her cares upon you. And Lord, would she take
[4174.86 → 4182.06] great delight and comfort in knowing that she is not her own, but belongs to her faithful God and Father,
[4182.06 → 4188.94] in the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, and we pray all of these things knowing that you love us, you hear us,
[4189.66 → 4196.70] and that you intercede for us by your Holy Spirit. We pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[4197.26 → 4203.90] Amen. All right. So again, well, let's stand, and we'll go out with God's blessing upon us.
[4204.38 → 4210.22] Please join us for fellowship in the fellowship hall after. And for those who
[4210.86 → 4216.22] will be joining us for choir rehearsal again, that is happening after, and also the Mountain View Manor
[4216.22 → 4221.50] singing at 2.30. So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of God's blessing.
[4222.22 → 4228.46] The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4228.46 → 4232.46] The Lord lift his face upon you and give you peace. Amen.
[4240.22 → 4242.22] The Lord be a blessing. Amen.
[4242.22 → 4250.22] The Lord bless you and keep you. Amen.
[4250.22 → 4259.22] The Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord bless you and be gracious to you and be gracious to you.
[4259.22 → 4289.20] Thank you.
[4289.22 → 4319.20] Thank you.

[4409.22 → 4411.22] Thank you.
[4439.22 → 4441.22] Thank you.
