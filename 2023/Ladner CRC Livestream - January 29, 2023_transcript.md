[312.38 --> 316.32]  his series on the Beatitudes.
[316.32 --> 319.74]  Special welcome to those of you who are visiting with us.
[319.74 --> 328.92]  Please join us for fellowship and refreshments in the straight back in the room.
[328.92 --> 329.92]  There.

[341.60 --> 347.34]  and also a couple of reminders that next Sunday evening we'll be having a hymn sing here and
[347.34 --> 353.86]  also on Friday evening is a gospel concert which will be in Mandarin but I've been told that
[353.86 --> 359.26]  music is a universal language so I think we can understand.
[359.26 --> 362.28]  Our call to worship comes from Psalm 24.
[362.28 --> 363.94]  Lift up your heads, O your gates.
[363.94 --> 368.52]  Be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
[368.52 --> 370.28]  Who is this King of glory?
[370.28 --> 371.70]  The Lord Almighty.
[371.70 --> 374.28]  He is the King of glory.
[374.28 --> 380.58]  Please join me in a prayer of adoration which I take from Revelation 4.
[380.58 --> 386.92]  You are worthy our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and power for you created all
[386.92 --> 392.72]  things and by your will they were created and have their being.
[392.72 --> 398.38]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and
[398.38 --> 401.08]  honor and glory and praise.
[401.08 --> 407.38]  To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever
[407.38 --> 408.38]  and ever.
[408.38 --> 409.38]  Amen.

[430.64 --> 435.02]  Son be with us in truth and love.

[686.52 --> 697.12]  He began sin, who knew no sin, that we might become his righteousness.
[697.12 --> 705.08]  He humbled himself and carried that cross.
[705.46 --> 713.74]  Love so amazing, love so amazing.
[715.88 --> 726.70]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[727.12 --> 733.88]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[733.88 --> 740.64]  The rescue for sinners.
[742.64 --> 746.22]  The ransom from heaven.
[746.22 --> 756.98]  Jesus, Messiah, Lord of all.
[756.98 --> 765.74]  His body that red, his blood the white.
[765.74 --> 770.74]  Broken and poured out all for love.
[770.74 --> 777.50]  The whole world trembled and the veil was torn.
[777.50 --> 787.50]  Love so amazing, love so amazing.
[787.50 --> 792.26]  Jesus, Messiah.
[792.26 --> 799.02]  Messiah, name above all names.
[799.02 --> 829.02] 
[829.02 --> 837.78]  All our hope is in you.
[837.78 --> 843.54]  All our hope is in you.
[843.54 --> 849.54]  All the glory to you, God.
[849.54 --> 856.30]  The light of the world.
[856.30 --> 867.06]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[867.06 --> 873.82]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[873.82 --> 882.58]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[882.58 --> 889.34]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[889.34 --> 898.10]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[898.10 --> 909.86]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[909.86 --> 914.86]  Lord of all names.
[914.86 --> 919.36]  Lord of all names.
[919.36 --> 939.36]  Lord of all names.
[939.36 --> 942.12]  Jesus, Messiah, name above all names.
[942.12 --> 950.14]  and kids that I teach is to understand and know that God knows us personally.
[950.42 --> 951.38]  He knows our name.
[951.52 --> 953.28]  He cares about us individually.
[953.58 --> 959.06]  And I think that makes a difference as we carry the burdens of life
[959.06 --> 963.20]  and encounter what's ahead and look forward to each day.
[963.70 --> 966.00]  Let's be encouraged that he knows our name.
[972.12 --> 990.80]  I have a maker before my heart
[990.80 --> 997.02]  Before even time began
[997.02 --> 1002.02]  My life was in his hand
[1002.02 --> 1008.02]  He knows my name
[1008.02 --> 1015.02]  He knows my every thought
[1015.02 --> 1020.02]  He sees each tear that falls
[1020.02 --> 1026.02]  And hears me when I call
[1026.02 --> 1031.02]  I have a father
[1031.02 --> 1037.02]  He calls me his own
[1037.02 --> 1043.02]  He'll never leave me
[1043.02 --> 1048.02]  No matter where I go
[1048.02 --> 1054.02]  He knows my name
[1054.02 --> 1060.02]  He knows my every thought
[1060.02 --> 1065.02]  He sees each tear that falls
[1065.02 --> 1071.02]  He hears me when I call
[1071.02 --> 1077.02]  He knows my name
[1077.02 --> 1083.02]  He knows my every thought
[1083.02 --> 1086.02]  He sees each tear that falls
[1086.02 --> 1089.02]  He sees each tear that falls
[1089.02 --> 1094.02]  And hears me when I call
[1094.02 --> 1100.02]  And hears me when I call
[1100.02 --> 1101.02]  My every thought
[1101.02 --> 1105.02]  I am
[1105.02 --> 1111.02]  It's no time for our prayer of confession
[1111.02 --> 1114.00]  Which will be on the screen
[1117.02 --> 1120.02]  God of living water, you call us to come and drink
[1120.02 --> 1121.14]  come and drink.
[1127.86 --> 1133.02]  You call us to strike the rocks of our world and let your living water flow.
[1136.28 --> 1137.94]  That the spring is there.
[1138.70 --> 1143.48]  We want to find the water on our own, using our own wisdom.
[1144.44 --> 1149.22]  You call us to share the water of life with the world around us.
[1150.02 --> 1158.32]  We believe that the water is limited, not abundant, and so we are tempted to save it for ourselves.
[1159.46 --> 1165.70]  For all the times we turn away from your water, for all the times we sully the water by misusing it,
[1166.26 --> 1170.24]  for all the times we let others go thirsty instead of offering a drink.
[1174.62 --> 1177.64]  Now for our pardon, assurance.
[1177.64 --> 1185.20]  The water of life flows with abundance to fill us with hope, to cleanse us of our guilt,
[1185.68 --> 1187.56]  to float us to a new life.
[1188.36 --> 1194.44]  Washed in the living water, we are forgiven and set free to live abundant life.
[1195.34 --> 1198.22]  Thanks and praise to God. Amen.
[1198.22 --> 1201.52]  Now we'll join in a song, Living Waters.
[1201.52 --> 1201.54]  Now we'll join in a song, Living Waters.
[1201.54 --> 1201.68]  Now we'll join in a song, Living Waters.
[1201.68 --> 1201.70]  Now we'll join in a song, Living Waters.
[1203.70 --> 1211.86]  The attendees out of Ireland have produced and written for us many what I call modern hymns
[1211.86 --> 1222.00]  that are very singable and have several verses for us to enjoy the truths that they share.
[1222.00 --> 1224.18]  So this one is called Living Waters.
[1224.32 --> 1232.12]  It's new for us here at the church, but we feel that you'll be able to embrace this quickly
[1232.12 --> 1236.50]  and enjoy the music and the words of this song, Living Waters.
[1236.50 --> 1238.50]  Living Waters.
[1238.50 --> 1252.58]  Are you thirsty?
[1252.58 --> 1255.72]  Are you empty?
[1255.72 --> 1261.10]  Come and drink this living for us.
[1261.10 --> 1291.08]  Come and drink this living for us.
[1291.10 --> 1304.92]  Let's sing.
[1304.92 --> 1310.40]  Love.
[1312.56 --> 1315.24]  Coming.
[1315.24 --> 1316.52]  Love.
[1316.52 --> 1320.20]  fear
[1335.80 --> 1338.68]  in these
[1338.68 --> 1346.02]  Lead your children to the shoreline
[1346.02 --> 1350.14]  Life is in these living waters
[1350.14 --> 1357.14]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love
[1357.14 --> 1362.14]  Bringing joy to the city of our lives
[1362.14 --> 1368.96]  There are hope is secure, do not fear anymore
[1368.96 --> 1373.48]  Raise the heart of living water
[1392.14 --> 1407.16]  Are you thirsty? Are you empty?
[1408.00 --> 1411.96]  Come and drink these living waters
[1411.96 --> 1419.14]  Life, forgiveness, past and boundless
[1419.14 --> 1422.96]  Christ, He is our living waters
[1422.96 --> 1430.10]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love
[1430.10 --> 1434.96]  Bringing joy to the city of our lives
[1434.96 --> 1442.08]  There are hope is secure, do not fear anymore
[1442.08 --> 1446.24]  Raise the heart of living water
[1446.24 --> 1454.02]  There are hope is secure, do not fear anymore
[1454.02 --> 1460.56]  Raise the heart of living water
[1460.56 --> 1464.50]  Amen
[1464.96 --> 1470.34]  At this time our children and their teachers
[1470.34 --> 1472.58]  Are dismissed for a kid's life
[1472.58 --> 1476.04]  For ages 3 to grade 5
[1476.04 --> 1478.46]  So bless them on their way
[1478.46 --> 1484.20]  Welcome Pastor Jason to the pulpit
[1494.96 --> 1498.34]  Good morning to you all
[1498.34 --> 1502.58]  And a special welcome to
[1502.58 --> 1505.66]  Johnny's friend Braden who is watching on live stream
[1505.66 --> 1506.92]  Hey Braden
[1506.92 --> 1512.68]  So we are continuing our series
[1512.68 --> 1514.28]  As John mentioned for us
[1514.28 --> 1516.80]  On the Beatitudes that is found in the Gospel of Matthew
[1516.80 --> 1520.16]  And we've been continuing to explore
[1520.16 --> 1521.32]  And to ask this question
[1521.32 --> 1523.08]  What does it mean to be
[1523.08 --> 1525.54]  And to increasingly become
[1525.54 --> 1527.78]  Disciples of Jesus
[1527.78 --> 1533.16]  Matthew 5 verse 1 gives us the context of the Beatitudes
[1533.16 --> 1535.40]  Which is the very first part of the Sermon on the Mount
[1535.40 --> 1537.16]  And Jesus says
[1537.16 --> 1539.86]  Now when Jesus saw the crowds
[1539.86 --> 1541.28]  He went up on a mountainside
[1541.28 --> 1542.20]  And he sat down
[1542.20 --> 1544.16]  His disciples came to him
[1544.16 --> 1546.16]  And he began to teach them
[1546.16 --> 1549.18]  So Jesus is teaching
[1549.18 --> 1550.44]  His disciples
[1550.44 --> 1552.72]  And so these Beatitudes
[1552.72 --> 1554.90]  They're not entrance requirements
[1554.90 --> 1556.84]  To get into the Kingdom of God
[1556.84 --> 1557.54]  Right
[1557.54 --> 1558.60]  They're not a list of
[1558.60 --> 1560.46]  All these things you have to check off
[1560.46 --> 1563.08]  In order to be accepted by God
[1563.08 --> 1564.44]  But
[1564.44 --> 1567.48]  If you have already met Jesus
[1567.48 --> 1569.88]  And if you've been grasped by the Gospel
[1569.88 --> 1572.36]  If you are now a citizen
[1572.36 --> 1574.18]  Of the Kingdom of God
[1574.18 --> 1575.66]  Because you have repented
[1575.66 --> 1577.22]  And made this U-turn
[1577.22 --> 1580.54]  And turned toward Christ
[1580.54 --> 1582.14]  In faith
[1582.14 --> 1583.74]  Then
[1583.74 --> 1585.58]  Jesus expects that
[1585.58 --> 1587.40]  His teaching in the Beatitudes
[1587.40 --> 1589.86]  Is to bring a response
[1589.86 --> 1591.22]  Right
[1591.22 --> 1591.92]  These words
[1591.92 --> 1594.00]  Are to bring fruitfulness
[1594.00 --> 1595.76]  That begin to characterize
[1595.76 --> 1598.66]  The people who are going to be known
[1598.66 --> 1599.74]  By His name
[1599.74 --> 1602.08]  And so the Beatitudes
[1602.08 --> 1604.18]  Are Jesus' blessing
[1604.18 --> 1605.24]  On those
[1605.24 --> 1608.00]  Whose lives are being remade
[1608.00 --> 1609.72]  And restored
[1609.72 --> 1610.78]  And polished
[1610.78 --> 1612.52]  Into something beautiful
[1612.52 --> 1613.20]  By Jesus
[1613.20 --> 1614.22]  Day after day
[1614.22 --> 1615.80]  By His grace
[1615.80 --> 1617.46]  And so today
[1617.46 --> 1618.92]  We are continuing on
[1618.92 --> 1620.10]  In the fifth Beatitude
[1620.10 --> 1622.14]  Which we find in Matthew 5
[1622.14 --> 1623.50]  Verse 7
[1623.50 --> 1625.86]  But what I'd like to do
[1625.86 --> 1628.28]  Is I'd like to read them out loud together
[1628.28 --> 1630.86]  We'll read all the Beatitudes
[1630.86 --> 1631.94]  So Matthew 5
[1631.94 --> 1633.46]  Verse 3
[1633.46 --> 1635.06]  Through verse 10
[1635.06 --> 1635.76]  You know
[1635.76 --> 1636.64]  And every week
[1636.64 --> 1637.92]  We are taking a whole week
[1637.92 --> 1639.02]  To try to unpack
[1639.02 --> 1640.68]  A little bit of each one
[1640.68 --> 1641.70]  But I hope as we
[1641.70 --> 1643.06]  Read them together
[1643.06 --> 1644.32]  Over eight weeks
[1644.32 --> 1646.06]  A good kind of goal
[1646.06 --> 1647.22]  I think for all of us
[1647.22 --> 1648.06]  Would be to try to memorize
[1648.06 --> 1648.80]  This passage
[1648.80 --> 1650.52]  And maybe in the last Sunday
[1650.52 --> 1651.82]  Maybe I should have told you
[1651.82 --> 1652.54]  This the first week
[1652.54 --> 1654.42]  But maybe on the last Sunday
[1654.42 --> 1655.34]  You know
[1655.34 --> 1656.72]  We could try to do it
[1656.72 --> 1657.10]  Without looking
[1657.10 --> 1657.34]  You know
[1657.34 --> 1657.78]  We can all
[1657.78 --> 1659.18]  We can all recite it together
[1659.18 --> 1660.44]  But anyway
[1660.44 --> 1661.10]  Today
[1661.10 --> 1662.26]  Snow Pop Quiz
[1662.26 --> 1664.20]  Let's read it out loud
[1664.20 --> 1664.78]  Together
[1664.78 --> 1665.74]  Please join me
[1665.74 --> 1668.72]  Blessed are the poor in spirit
[1668.72 --> 1671.48]  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1671.48 --> 1674.38]  Blessed are those who mourn
[1674.38 --> 1676.58]  For they will be comforted
[1676.58 --> 1678.84]  Blessed are the meek
[1678.84 --> 1681.36]  For they will inherit the earth
[1681.36 --> 1683.96]  Blessed are those who hunger
[1683.96 --> 1685.64]  And thirst for righteousness
[1685.64 --> 1688.06]  For they will be filled
[1688.06 --> 1690.38]  Blessed are the merciful
[1690.38 --> 1693.10]  For they will be shown mercy
[1693.10 --> 1695.96]  Blessed are the pure in heart
[1695.96 --> 1698.18]  For they will see God
[1698.18 --> 1700.64]  Blessed are the peacemakers
[1700.64 --> 1702.62]  For they will be called
[1702.62 --> 1703.90]  Children of God
[1703.90 --> 1706.84]  Blessed are those who are persecuted
[1706.84 --> 1708.32]  Because of righteousness
[1708.32 --> 1711.92]  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1711.92 --> 1714.08]  This is the word of the Lord
[1714.08 --> 1715.64]  Thanks be to God
[1715.64 --> 1716.48]  Let's pray
[1716.48 --> 1718.68]  Heavenly Father
[1718.68 --> 1719.44]  Once again
[1719.44 --> 1720.86]  We come before you
[1720.86 --> 1722.26]  Grateful that you
[1722.26 --> 1724.32]  Inspired
[1724.32 --> 1725.22]  That you
[1725.22 --> 1726.60]  Enabled Matthew
[1726.60 --> 1727.50]  The tax collector
[1727.50 --> 1728.74]  To hear and to remember
[1728.74 --> 1730.24]  All of these words from Jesus
[1730.24 --> 1732.06]  And to write them down
[1732.06 --> 1733.58]  So that we too today
[1733.58 --> 1735.20]  Might hear them
[1735.20 --> 1737.08]  And Lord
[1737.08 --> 1738.24]  Would you help us now
[1738.24 --> 1739.12]  By your mercy
[1739.12 --> 1739.86]  And your grace
[1739.86 --> 1741.04]  To listen
[1741.04 --> 1743.28]  To be disciples
[1743.28 --> 1744.16]  Who would sit
[1744.16 --> 1745.08]  At the feet
[1745.08 --> 1747.38]  Of our master
[1747.38 --> 1748.14]  Our teacher
[1748.14 --> 1749.80]  And Lord
[1749.80 --> 1750.78]  Not only would you help us
[1750.78 --> 1751.24]  To listen
[1751.24 --> 1752.38]  But would you help us
[1752.38 --> 1753.84]  To be shaped
[1753.84 --> 1754.86]  By these words
[1754.86 --> 1756.80]  And to respond
[1756.80 --> 1758.18]  And in fruitfulness
[1758.18 --> 1759.26]  To grow in us
[1759.26 --> 1760.60]  And we pray in Jesus name
[1760.60 --> 1761.36]  Amen
[1761.36 --> 1763.42]  So again
[1763.42 --> 1764.04]  We're here in this
[1764.04 --> 1764.80]  Fifth beatitude
[1764.80 --> 1766.16]  That we're focusing on
[1766.16 --> 1766.82]  And let's put it
[1766.82 --> 1768.36]  Look at it again here
[1768.36 --> 1770.32]  Blessed are the merciful
[1770.32 --> 1772.60]  For they will be shown mercy
[1772.60 --> 1774.84]  Blessed are the merciful
[1774.84 --> 1777.52]  For they will be shown mercy
[1777.52 --> 1780.40]  The fifth beatitude
[1780.40 --> 1782.68]  Is about God's mercy
[1782.68 --> 1785.00]  And it's about us
[1785.00 --> 1785.66]  His disciples
[1785.66 --> 1787.56]  Being and becoming
[1787.56 --> 1789.06]  The blessed merciful
[1789.06 --> 1791.02]  So let's think this
[1791.02 --> 1791.54]  Through together
[1791.54 --> 1792.12]  And I want to ask
[1792.12 --> 1793.18]  Two questions this morning
[1793.18 --> 1793.92]  As we look at this
[1793.92 --> 1794.42]  So first
[1794.42 --> 1795.12]  What does it mean
[1795.12 --> 1795.76]  To be merciful?
[1796.56 --> 1797.06]  What does it mean
[1797.06 --> 1797.60]  To be merciful?
[1798.04 --> 1798.46]  And second
[1798.46 --> 1799.88]  Why are the merciful
[1799.88 --> 1800.66]  Blessed?
[1801.30 --> 1801.72]  What does it mean
[1801.72 --> 1802.22]  To be merciful?
[1802.54 --> 1803.54]  Why are the merciful blessed?
[1803.86 --> 1804.72]  So the first question
[1804.72 --> 1805.52]  What does it mean
[1805.52 --> 1806.80]  To be merciful?
[1807.10 --> 1807.66]  Or you know
[1807.66 --> 1809.64]  What is mercy?
[1809.90 --> 1810.88]  What does that look like?
[1811.70 --> 1812.84]  When I was thinking about this
[1812.84 --> 1813.42]  The first thing
[1813.42 --> 1814.88]  That came into my mind
[1814.88 --> 1815.68]  For some reason
[1815.68 --> 1818.06]  Is my dad
[1818.06 --> 1819.54]  Playing around
[1819.54 --> 1820.96]  Horsing around
[1820.96 --> 1822.28]  And wrestling with me
[1822.28 --> 1823.80]  When I was a teenager
[1823.80 --> 1824.50]  Living at home
[1824.50 --> 1825.80]  Sometimes
[1825.80 --> 1827.42]  I'd be standing in the kitchen
[1827.42 --> 1828.12]  Like a teenager
[1828.12 --> 1829.00]  Making food
[1829.00 --> 1830.06]  Which I did a lot
[1830.06 --> 1831.00]  And he'd kind of
[1831.00 --> 1831.74]  Come up behind me
[1831.74 --> 1833.06]  And put my head
[1833.06 --> 1834.36]  Into a headlock
[1834.36 --> 1836.24]  And because
[1836.24 --> 1836.78]  He's bigger
[1836.78 --> 1837.78]  And stronger than me
[1837.78 --> 1838.96]  Not always
[1838.96 --> 1839.84]  But sometimes
[1839.84 --> 1841.14]  I wouldn't be able
[1841.14 --> 1841.86]  To escape
[1841.86 --> 1842.98]  And break free
[1842.98 --> 1844.90]  And so what happens
[1844.90 --> 1845.76]  If you are pinned
[1845.76 --> 1846.52]  In a headlock
[1846.52 --> 1847.40]  By your dad?
[1848.16 --> 1849.12]  You're forced to say
[1849.12 --> 1850.06]  A particular word
[1850.06 --> 1851.44]  Do you know what it is?
[1852.90 --> 1853.34]  Mercy
[1853.34 --> 1853.80]  Yeah
[1853.80 --> 1855.10]  But you know
[1855.10 --> 1856.20]  There's this phrase
[1856.20 --> 1857.12]  Uncle
[1857.12 --> 1858.02]  Does anybody know
[1858.02 --> 1858.42]  That phrase
[1858.42 --> 1859.00]  That expression
[1859.00 --> 1859.44]  Uncle?
[1859.70 --> 1860.32]  Say uncle
[1860.32 --> 1861.78]  Yeah well
[1861.78 --> 1862.24]  No I mean
[1862.24 --> 1864.52]  That's what he would
[1864.52 --> 1865.34]  That's what you would say
[1865.34 --> 1868.48]  Now when someone says
[1868.48 --> 1869.72]  To say uncle
[1869.72 --> 1871.06]  You're demanding
[1871.06 --> 1871.92]  That your opponent
[1871.92 --> 1873.68]  Submit to defeat
[1873.68 --> 1875.44]  And so the response is
[1875.44 --> 1876.40]  Uncle uncle
[1876.40 --> 1876.76]  Right
[1876.76 --> 1878.74]  I give up
[1878.74 --> 1879.52]  I can't get out
[1879.52 --> 1881.56]  I can't take it anymore
[1881.56 --> 1882.18]  Or
[1882.18 --> 1883.80]  Mercy
[1883.80 --> 1885.20]  Have mercy
[1885.20 --> 1887.32]  Well this game
[1887.32 --> 1888.02]  Tells us something
[1888.02 --> 1889.18]  Helpful about mercy
[1889.18 --> 1891.16]  Mercy is the cry
[1891.16 --> 1891.80]  Of people
[1891.80 --> 1892.94]  Who are trapped
[1892.94 --> 1894.00]  In misery
[1894.00 --> 1896.18]  The person
[1896.18 --> 1896.62]  Who cries
[1896.62 --> 1897.22]  Mercy
[1897.22 --> 1898.90]  Is trapped
[1898.90 --> 1900.02]  They're defeated
[1900.02 --> 1902.84]  They can't get out of it
[1902.84 --> 1903.74]  And they're suffering
[1903.74 --> 1905.56]  And when it comes
[1905.56 --> 1907.04]  To our real need
[1907.04 --> 1907.64]  For mercy
[1907.64 --> 1907.82]  Right
[1907.82 --> 1908.58]  Not just wrestling
[1908.58 --> 1909.28]  With your dad
[1909.28 --> 1910.64]  We
[1910.64 --> 1912.22]  Need mercy
[1912.22 --> 1913.48]  We are
[1913.48 --> 1914.08]  Hurting
[1914.08 --> 1915.40]  Because of the misery
[1915.40 --> 1916.60]  Of sin
[1916.60 --> 1918.94]  And when we talk
[1918.94 --> 1919.70]  About the misery
[1919.70 --> 1920.36]  Of sin
[1920.36 --> 1920.86]  The Bible
[1920.86 --> 1921.92]  Has a wide
[1921.92 --> 1923.30]  Scope lens
[1923.30 --> 1925.26]  About what sin
[1925.26 --> 1926.02]  Is
[1926.02 --> 1927.58]  And the misery
[1927.58 --> 1928.28]  That sin
[1928.28 --> 1928.88]  Causes
[1928.88 --> 1930.04]  In our world
[1930.04 --> 1932.06]  Sin is anything
[1932.06 --> 1932.96]  That is going
[1932.96 --> 1934.36]  Against the grain
[1934.36 --> 1934.96]  Of the kingdom
[1934.96 --> 1935.52]  Of God
[1935.52 --> 1936.54]  Right
[1936.54 --> 1937.22]  Sin is anything
[1937.22 --> 1938.70]  That is out of harmony
[1938.70 --> 1939.78]  With God's will
[1939.78 --> 1941.56]  It's anything
[1941.56 --> 1942.60]  That causes pain
[1942.60 --> 1943.24]  Or suffering
[1943.24 --> 1944.24]  In the good world
[1944.24 --> 1945.78]  That God has made
[1945.78 --> 1946.72]  That's sin
[1946.72 --> 1949.76]  And so what is mercy
[1949.76 --> 1951.44]  Well mercy
[1951.44 --> 1953.40]  Is an active response
[1953.40 --> 1954.80]  To the misery
[1954.80 --> 1955.36]  Of sin
[1955.36 --> 1956.82]  Mercy
[1956.82 --> 1957.84]  Sees
[1957.84 --> 1958.60]  The misery
[1958.60 --> 1959.28]  Of people
[1959.28 --> 1960.18]  Who are suffering
[1960.18 --> 1960.98]  Because of sin
[1960.98 --> 1962.06]  And then it actively
[1962.06 --> 1963.14]  Responds
[1963.14 --> 1964.56]  To alleviate
[1964.56 --> 1966.68]  That sin
[1966.68 --> 1967.32]  And suffering
[1967.32 --> 1968.00]  Right
[1968.00 --> 1969.08]  That's what mercy is
[1969.08 --> 1970.70]  And so the merciful
[1970.70 --> 1971.34]  Person
[1971.34 --> 1972.46]  Is willing
[1972.46 --> 1974.42]  To see a situation
[1974.42 --> 1976.66]  Really from another
[1976.66 --> 1978.16]  Person's point of view
[1978.16 --> 1980.06]  And they're willing
[1980.06 --> 1981.56]  To identify deeply
[1981.56 --> 1982.30]  With that person
[1982.30 --> 1983.00]  Who is hurting
[1983.00 --> 1984.76]  And so it's this
[1984.76 --> 1985.54]  On the one hand
[1985.54 --> 1986.66]  This inner disposition
[1986.66 --> 1988.28]  It's this heart
[1988.28 --> 1990.06]  This gospel shaped heart
[1990.06 --> 1990.78]  And attitude
[1990.78 --> 1992.92]  That inclines us
[1992.92 --> 1993.88]  To compassion
[1993.88 --> 1995.30]  For those who are suffering
[1995.30 --> 1996.04]  Because of sin
[1996.04 --> 1998.58]  But it's not only
[1998.58 --> 1999.66]  This inner attitude
[1999.66 --> 2001.06]  Where we feel
[2001.06 --> 2001.94]  You know
[2001.94 --> 2002.44]  Sorry
[2002.44 --> 2003.48]  We feel compassion
[2003.48 --> 2004.16]  For someone
[2004.16 --> 2004.80]  Who is suffering
[2004.80 --> 2006.44]  But then
[2006.44 --> 2007.88]  The merciful person
[2007.88 --> 2009.46]  Also enters in
[2009.46 --> 2010.76]  And acts
[2010.76 --> 2012.74]  The merciful person
[2012.74 --> 2014.52]  Identifies with the misery
[2014.52 --> 2015.44]  Of the other person
[2015.44 --> 2016.78]  And then they do
[2016.78 --> 2017.58]  Something about it
[2017.58 --> 2018.64]  They're compelled
[2018.64 --> 2020.18]  To relieve suffering
[2020.18 --> 2021.72]  They engage
[2021.72 --> 2022.64]  In acts
[2022.64 --> 2023.52]  Of mercy
[2023.52 --> 2026.58]  And we know this
[2026.58 --> 2028.24]  Because the Bible
[2028.24 --> 2029.08]  Reveals to us
[2029.08 --> 2029.76]  A God
[2029.76 --> 2031.68]  Who is a God
[2031.68 --> 2032.38]  Of mercy
[2032.38 --> 2034.20]  Mercy
[2034.20 --> 2036.12]  Being merciful
[2036.12 --> 2037.66]  Is bound up
[2037.66 --> 2038.68]  In the very character
[2038.68 --> 2039.22]  Of God
[2039.22 --> 2041.28]  God demonstrates
[2041.28 --> 2041.98]  For us
[2041.98 --> 2043.74]  What mercy is
[2043.74 --> 2045.30]  And what mercy
[2045.30 --> 2046.36]  Looks like
[2046.36 --> 2047.62]  So Paul
[2047.62 --> 2048.26]  For example
[2048.26 --> 2049.54]  Writing in Ephesians 2
[2049.54 --> 2050.22]  Says this
[2050.22 --> 2051.64]  But because of
[2051.64 --> 2052.54]  His great love
[2052.54 --> 2053.00]  For us
[2053.00 --> 2054.10]  God who is rich
[2054.10 --> 2054.88]  In mercy
[2054.88 --> 2056.58]  Made us alive
[2056.58 --> 2057.20]  With Christ
[2057.20 --> 2058.36]  Even when we were
[2058.36 --> 2059.72]  Dead in transgressions
[2059.72 --> 2061.88]  So God has this
[2061.88 --> 2063.16]  Character of love
[2063.16 --> 2063.68]  And mercy
[2063.68 --> 2064.66]  It's who he is
[2064.66 --> 2066.60]  And because of that
[2066.60 --> 2068.08]  He sees us
[2068.08 --> 2069.52]  That when we were
[2069.52 --> 2070.54]  Stuck in the misery
[2070.54 --> 2070.94]  Of sin
[2070.94 --> 2071.48]  We were dead
[2071.48 --> 2072.42]  In our trespasses
[2072.42 --> 2073.94]  And because he's
[2073.94 --> 2074.96]  A God of mercy
[2074.96 --> 2076.10]  Not only does he
[2076.10 --> 2076.64]  See us
[2076.64 --> 2077.50]  He acts
[2077.50 --> 2078.38]  To save us
[2078.38 --> 2079.20]  We are made
[2079.20 --> 2080.12]  Alive with Christ
[2080.12 --> 2081.74]  You know
[2081.74 --> 2083.02]  Mercy is a
[2083.02 --> 2084.10]  Continual theme
[2084.10 --> 2085.18]  In Matthew's
[2085.18 --> 2085.56]  Gospel
[2085.56 --> 2087.36]  As Matthew's
[2087.36 --> 2088.26]  Gospel begins
[2088.26 --> 2089.74]  This mercy
[2089.74 --> 2090.10]  Of God
[2090.10 --> 2090.56]  Is evident
[2090.56 --> 2092.28]  That long
[2092.28 --> 2093.06]  Genealogy
[2093.06 --> 2093.68]  That we spent
[2093.68 --> 2094.14]  Some time
[2094.14 --> 2094.70]  Looking at
[2094.70 --> 2095.32]  During the season
[2095.32 --> 2095.84]  Of Advent
[2095.84 --> 2097.28]  Is not just
[2097.28 --> 2098.00]  A road map
[2098.00 --> 2098.58]  To show us
[2098.58 --> 2099.16]  Where Jesus
[2099.16 --> 2099.94]  Came from
[2099.94 --> 2100.80]  But rather
[2100.80 --> 2101.56]  It's actually
[2101.56 --> 2102.30]  A testament
[2102.30 --> 2104.02]  To God's
[2104.02 --> 2104.62]  Mercy
[2104.62 --> 2105.42]  Towards sinners
[2105.42 --> 2106.26]  And sufferers
[2106.26 --> 2107.56]  And then
[2107.56 --> 2107.90]  In the very
[2107.90 --> 2108.60]  First chapter
[2108.60 --> 2109.04]  Matthew
[2109.04 --> 2109.84]  Writes of
[2109.84 --> 2110.24]  The birth
[2110.24 --> 2110.74]  Of Jesus
[2110.74 --> 2112.10]  In chapter
[2112.10 --> 2112.36]  One
[2112.36 --> 2112.82]  He says
[2112.82 --> 2114.62]  She will
[2114.62 --> 2115.10]  Give birth
[2115.10 --> 2115.88]  To a son
[2115.88 --> 2117.34]  And you
[2117.34 --> 2117.78]  Are to give
[2117.78 --> 2118.40]  Him the name
[2118.40 --> 2118.78]  Jesus
[2118.78 --> 2119.38]  Because
[2119.38 --> 2120.52]  He will
[2120.52 --> 2121.14]  Save his
[2121.14 --> 2121.46]  People
[2121.46 --> 2121.98]  From their
[2121.98 --> 2122.50]  Sins
[2122.50 --> 2124.56]  And then
[2124.56 --> 2125.02]  In Matthew
[2125.02 --> 2125.36]  Chapter
[2125.36 --> 2125.74]  Nine
[2125.74 --> 2125.96]  Verse
[2125.96 --> 2126.46]  Thirteen
[2126.46 --> 2127.48]  The Pharisees
[2127.48 --> 2128.22]  Were unhappy
[2128.22 --> 2128.94]  With Jesus
[2128.94 --> 2129.36]  Because
[2129.36 --> 2130.20]  He was
[2130.20 --> 2130.70]  Dining
[2130.70 --> 2131.58]  With sinners
[2131.58 --> 2132.52]  And tax collectors
[2132.52 --> 2133.90]  And Jesus
[2133.90 --> 2134.60]  Response
[2134.60 --> 2135.08]  Was
[2135.08 --> 2136.62]  I desire
[2136.62 --> 2137.64]  Mercy
[2137.64 --> 2138.98]  Not sacrifice
[2138.98 --> 2139.82]  For I've
[2139.82 --> 2140.26]  Not come
[2140.26 --> 2140.64]  To call
[2140.64 --> 2141.20]  The righteous
[2141.20 --> 2142.88]  But sinners
[2142.88 --> 2144.48]  Right
[2144.48 --> 2144.78]  Jesus
[2144.78 --> 2145.20]  Did not
[2145.20 --> 2145.94]  Come down
[2145.94 --> 2147.20]  From heaven
[2147.20 --> 2148.80]  To judge
[2148.80 --> 2149.64]  What we've
[2149.64 --> 2150.00]  Done
[2150.00 --> 2151.78]  He's come
[2151.78 --> 2152.30]  Down from
[2152.30 --> 2152.68]  Heaven
[2152.68 --> 2153.78]  With mercy
[2153.78 --> 2155.36]  To give us
[2155.36 --> 2155.82]  Our lives
[2155.82 --> 2156.20]  Back
[2156.20 --> 2157.84]  To give us
[2157.84 --> 2158.18]  This whole
[2158.18 --> 2158.90]  World back
[2158.90 --> 2159.54]  To restore
[2159.54 --> 2160.26]  All things
[2160.26 --> 2160.98]  And ultimately
[2160.98 --> 2162.04]  To give us
[2162.04 --> 2162.58]  God back
[2162.58 --> 2163.18]  To restore
[2163.18 --> 2163.78]  Us to God
[2163.78 --> 2164.82]  And Jesus
[2164.82 --> 2165.20]  Came and
[2165.20 --> 2165.48]  He said
[2165.48 --> 2165.78]  I have
[2165.78 --> 2166.22]  Not come
[2166.22 --> 2166.58]  To call
[2166.58 --> 2167.50]  The righteous
[2167.50 --> 2168.68]  But sinners
[2168.68 --> 2169.50]  He came
[2169.50 --> 2170.60]  With mercy
[2170.60 --> 2172.00]  And friends
[2172.00 --> 2172.78]  This is the
[2172.78 --> 2173.14]  Heart
[2173.14 --> 2173.70]  Of the
[2173.70 --> 2174.00]  God
[2174.00 --> 2174.30]  That we
[2174.30 --> 2174.62]  Worship
[2174.62 --> 2175.72]  He is
[2175.72 --> 2176.44]  A God
[2176.44 --> 2177.24]  Of mercy
[2177.24 --> 2178.04]  And it says
[2178.04 --> 2178.56]  In Exodus
[2178.56 --> 2179.18]  34
[2179.18 --> 2180.42]  He's a
[2180.42 --> 2180.72]  God
[2180.72 --> 2181.82]  Merciful
[2181.82 --> 2182.88]  And gracious
[2182.88 --> 2184.44]  Slow to
[2184.44 --> 2184.90]  Anger
[2184.90 --> 2186.28]  And abounding
[2186.28 --> 2187.06]  In steadfast
[2187.06 --> 2187.42]  Love and
[2187.42 --> 2187.96]  Faithfulness
[2187.96 --> 2189.88]  And what
[2189.88 --> 2190.26]  He's saying
[2190.26 --> 2190.60]  To us
[2190.60 --> 2191.02]  Today
[2191.02 --> 2191.62]  In this
[2191.62 --> 2192.16]  Beatitude
[2192.16 --> 2192.80]  Is that
[2192.80 --> 2193.30]  It is the
[2193.30 --> 2193.80]  Merciful
[2193.80 --> 2194.60]  Who he
[2194.60 --> 2195.14]  Will use
[2195.14 --> 2195.66]  To spread
[2195.66 --> 2196.32]  His mercy
[2196.32 --> 2197.66]  If
[2197.66 --> 2198.82]  We are
[2198.82 --> 2199.38]  Willing
[2199.38 --> 2200.08]  To follow
[2200.08 --> 2200.56]  Him
[2200.56 --> 2200.94]  In that
[2200.94 --> 2201.18]  Way
[2201.18 --> 2203.06]  And that's
[2203.06 --> 2203.46]  Why Jesus
[2203.46 --> 2204.08]  Says to us
[2204.08 --> 2204.32]  Here
[2204.32 --> 2204.84]  Blessed
[2204.84 --> 2205.50]  Are the
[2205.50 --> 2205.94]  Merciful
[2205.94 --> 2207.16]  Because when
[2207.16 --> 2207.66]  We become
[2207.66 --> 2208.36]  People who
[2208.36 --> 2209.08]  Are merciful
[2209.08 --> 2210.10]  Jesus says
[2210.10 --> 2210.58]  To us
[2210.58 --> 2211.94]  Congratulations
[2211.94 --> 2213.44]  Blessed
[2213.44 --> 2214.04]  Are you
[2214.04 --> 2214.80]  You are
[2214.80 --> 2215.50]  In harmony
[2215.50 --> 2216.52]  With the
[2216.52 --> 2216.78]  Kingdom
[2216.78 --> 2217.24]  Of God
[2217.24 --> 2217.48]  You are
[2217.48 --> 2217.76]  Beginning
[2217.76 --> 2218.64]  To reflect
[2218.64 --> 2219.34]  Who God
[2219.34 --> 2219.88]  Is
[2219.88 --> 2221.24]  So Jesus
[2221.24 --> 2222.10]  His disciples
[2222.10 --> 2223.76]  We become
[2223.76 --> 2224.18]  More and
[2224.18 --> 2224.76]  More merciful
[2224.76 --> 2225.60]  Because we
[2225.60 --> 2226.34]  Come to
[2226.34 --> 2226.92]  Know
[2226.92 --> 2228.12]  The God
[2228.12 --> 2228.96]  Who is
[2228.96 --> 2229.42]  Merciful
[2229.42 --> 2232.58]  The mercy
[2232.58 --> 2233.14]  Of God
[2233.14 --> 2233.76]  Is what
[2233.76 --> 2234.16]  Makes us
[2234.16 --> 2234.54]  Merciful
[2234.54 --> 2234.86]  Too
[2234.86 --> 2236.36]  And
[2236.36 --> 2237.48]  Because
[2237.48 --> 2238.72]  We long
[2238.72 --> 2239.60]  For everybody
[2239.60 --> 2240.70]  To know
[2240.70 --> 2241.38]  And experience
[2241.38 --> 2242.16]  God's mercy
[2242.16 --> 2242.84]  In Christ
[2242.84 --> 2244.30]  Regardless
[2244.30 --> 2246.12]  Of whether
[2246.12 --> 2247.06]  That misery
[2247.06 --> 2247.98]  Of sin
[2247.98 --> 2248.72]  Is caused
[2248.72 --> 2249.52]  By the
[2249.52 --> 2250.00]  Person's
[2250.00 --> 2250.94]  Own wrongdoing
[2250.94 --> 2252.14]  Or the
[2252.14 --> 2252.58]  Wrongdoing
[2252.58 --> 2253.12]  Of others
[2253.12 --> 2253.66]  And that's
[2253.66 --> 2254.06]  Important
[2254.06 --> 2255.58]  Both of
[2255.58 --> 2255.92]  These
[2255.92 --> 2257.76]  Are cases
[2257.76 --> 2259.76]  Where mercy
[2259.76 --> 2260.30]  Is needed
[2260.30 --> 2261.66]  Whether I
[2261.66 --> 2262.24]  Am suffering
[2262.24 --> 2263.36]  Because of
[2263.36 --> 2263.86]  My own
[2263.86 --> 2264.30]  Sin
[2264.30 --> 2266.02]  Or whether
[2266.02 --> 2266.42]  I am
[2266.42 --> 2266.86]  Suffering
[2266.86 --> 2267.48]  Because
[2267.48 --> 2268.46]  Someone has
[2268.46 --> 2268.76]  Sinned
[2268.76 --> 2269.32]  Against me
[2269.32 --> 2270.24]  Either way
[2270.24 --> 2271.80]  We need
[2271.80 --> 2272.20]  Mercy
[2272.20 --> 2274.12]  Now
[2274.12 --> 2274.80]  We need
[2274.80 --> 2275.08]  To see
[2275.08 --> 2275.28]  This
[2275.28 --> 2275.88]  Tangibly
[2275.88 --> 2277.14]  And so
[2277.14 --> 2277.36]  What I
[2277.36 --> 2277.54]  Want to
[2277.54 --> 2277.80]  Do is
[2277.80 --> 2278.04]  I want
[2278.04 --> 2278.32]  To look
[2278.32 --> 2278.64]  At some
[2278.64 --> 2279.06]  Gospel
[2279.06 --> 2279.90]  Accounts
[2279.90 --> 2280.92]  That show
[2280.92 --> 2281.52]  Jesus
[2281.52 --> 2282.26]  Illustrating
[2282.26 --> 2282.62]  Mercy
[2282.62 --> 2283.38]  For us
[2283.38 --> 2284.02]  Then I
[2284.02 --> 2284.26]  Also
[2284.26 --> 2284.70]  Want to
[2284.70 --> 2286.24]  Share
[2286.24 --> 2287.10]  Some more
[2287.10 --> 2287.56]  Modern
[2287.56 --> 2288.72]  Stories
[2288.72 --> 2288.94]  Or
[2288.94 --> 2289.82]  Illustrations
[2289.82 --> 2291.36]  As well
[2291.36 --> 2293.14]  So first
[2293.14 --> 2294.28]  What does
[2294.28 --> 2294.78]  It look
[2294.78 --> 2295.16]  Like
[2295.16 --> 2295.68]  To show
[2295.68 --> 2296.08]  Mercy
[2296.08 --> 2296.82]  To someone
[2296.82 --> 2298.22]  Who is
[2298.22 --> 2298.94]  In misery
[2298.94 --> 2299.78]  Due to
[2299.78 --> 2300.86]  The wrong
[2300.86 --> 2301.24]  Doings
[2301.24 --> 2301.84]  Of others
[2301.84 --> 2302.46]  What does
[2302.46 --> 2302.72]  It look
[2302.72 --> 2302.98]  Like to
[2302.98 --> 2303.38]  Show mercy
[2303.38 --> 2303.82]  To someone
[2303.82 --> 2305.06]  Who is
[2305.06 --> 2305.86]  Just miserable
[2305.86 --> 2306.82]  Because
[2306.82 --> 2307.44]  In their
[2307.44 --> 2307.88]  Suffering
[2307.88 --> 2308.12]  And they
[2308.12 --> 2308.58]  Are hurt
[2308.58 --> 2309.10]  Because of
[2309.10 --> 2309.42]  The wrong
[2309.42 --> 2309.68]  Doing
[2309.68 --> 2310.88]  Of others
[2310.88 --> 2312.70]  One of
[2312.70 --> 2313.08]  Jesus'
[2313.32 --> 2313.74]  Parables
[2313.74 --> 2314.06]  That is
[2314.06 --> 2314.90]  Most often
[2314.90 --> 2315.62]  Associated
[2315.62 --> 2316.32]  With mercy
[2316.32 --> 2316.74]  Is that
[2316.74 --> 2316.94]  Of the
[2316.94 --> 2317.10]  Good
[2317.10 --> 2317.58]  Samaritan
[2317.58 --> 2319.00]  It's a
[2319.00 --> 2319.30]  Parable
[2319.30 --> 2319.82]  That Jesus
[2319.82 --> 2320.44]  Tells
[2320.44 --> 2321.12]  In response
[2321.12 --> 2321.50]  To someone
[2321.50 --> 2321.68]  Who
[2321.68 --> 2321.96]  Asks
[2321.96 --> 2322.52]  The question
[2322.52 --> 2323.52]  Who
[2323.52 --> 2323.86]  Is my
[2323.86 --> 2324.28]  Neighbor
[2324.28 --> 2326.78]  Who
[2326.78 --> 2327.36]  Do I
[2327.36 --> 2327.68]  Have
[2327.68 --> 2328.04]  To show
[2328.04 --> 2328.32]  Mercy
[2328.32 --> 2328.52]  To
[2328.52 --> 2328.76]  And who
[2328.76 --> 2329.04]  Can I
[2329.04 --> 2329.24]  Not
[2329.24 --> 2329.42]  Show
[2329.42 --> 2329.64]  Mercy
[2329.64 --> 2329.88]  To
[2329.88 --> 2331.68]  I'm
[2331.68 --> 2331.94]  Supposed
[2331.94 --> 2332.22]  To love
[2332.22 --> 2332.42]  My
[2332.42 --> 2332.74]  Neighbor
[2332.74 --> 2333.78]  So who
[2333.78 --> 2334.16]  Is my
[2334.16 --> 2334.44]  Neighbor
[2334.44 --> 2335.56]  This is
[2335.56 --> 2336.04]  How Jesus
[2336.04 --> 2336.64]  Responds
[2336.64 --> 2337.00]  And you
[2337.00 --> 2337.28]  Know the
[2337.28 --> 2337.66]  Story is
[2337.66 --> 2337.86]  Very
[2337.86 --> 2338.22]  Familiar
[2338.22 --> 2338.80]  And not
[2338.80 --> 2339.18]  Not yet
[2339.18 --> 2341.76]  Let me
[2341.76 --> 2342.02]  Set it
[2342.02 --> 2342.14]  Up
[2342.14 --> 2342.42]  First
[2342.42 --> 2345.26]  So man
[2345.26 --> 2346.36]  Was traveling
[2346.36 --> 2347.36]  From Jerusalem
[2347.36 --> 2347.94]  Down to
[2347.94 --> 2348.42]  Jericho
[2348.42 --> 2349.68]  And on
[2349.68 --> 2350.16]  The way

[2713.08 --> 2713.46]  Else
[2713.46 --> 2714.80]  I
[2714.80 --> 2714.94]  Think
[2714.94 --> 2715.14]  That's
[2715.14 --> 2717.30]  The
[2717.30 --> 2717.56]  Value

[2717.76 --> 2718.10]  Can
[2718.10 --> 2718.96]  All
[2718.96 --> 2719.28]  Aspire
[2719.28 --> 2719.50]  To
[2719.50 --> 2719.74]  Isn't
[2719.74 --> 2719.90]  It
[2719.90 --> 2720.28]  It
[2720.28 --> 2721.16]  This
[2721.16 --> 2721.36]  Is
[2721.36 --> 2721.72]  One
[2721.72 --> 2721.76]  Of
[2721.76 --> 2721.88]  The
[2721.88 --> 2722.56]  Values
[2722.56 --> 2722.64]  Of
[2722.64 --> 2723.20]  Christianity
[2723.20 --> 2723.32]  That
[2723.32 --> 2723.58]  Still
[2723.58 --> 2723.82]  Has
[2723.82 --> 2724.50]  Resonance
[2724.50 --> 2724.62]  In
[2724.62 --> 2724.76]  Our
[2724.76 --> 2725.24]  Culture
[2725.24 --> 2726.20]  People
[2726.20 --> 2726.84]  Today
[2726.84 --> 2727.06]  They
[2727.06 --> 2729.12]  Look
[2729.12 --> 2729.18]  To
[2729.18 --> 2730.00]  To
[2730.00 --> 2730.58]  Relieve
[2730.58 --> 2731.00]  Suffering
[2731.00 --> 2732.98]  In
[2732.98 --> 2735.02]  The
[2735.02 --> 2735.50]  Christianity
[2735.50 --> 2736.82]  And
[2736.82 --> 2736.94]  So
[2736.94 --> 2737.10]  We
[2737.10 --> 2737.26]  Need
[2737.26 --> 2737.40]  To
[2737.40 --> 2737.60]  Lean
[2737.60 --> 2737.88]  Into
[2737.88 --> 2738.32]  This
[2738.32 --> 2738.82]  We
[2738.82 --> 2738.98]  Need
[2738.98 --> 2739.08]  To
[2739.08 --> 2739.22]  Do
[2739.22 --> 2739.34]  It
[2739.34 --> 2739.54]  Even
[2739.54 --> 2739.90]  More
[2739.90 --> 2740.08]  It
[2740.08 --> 2740.26]  Is
[2740.26 --> 2740.44]  A
[2740.44 --> 2740.90]  Bridge
[2740.90 --> 2741.06]  For
[2741.06 --> 2741.18]  The
[2741.18 --> 2741.58]  Gospel
[2741.58 --> 2742.42]  Not

[2742.82 --> 2743.72]  To
[2743.72 --> 2744.00]  Of
[2744.00 --> 2744.40]  Relieving

[2745.18 --> 2745.34]  Of
[2745.34 --> 2745.66]  People
[2745.66 --> 2747.80]  But
[2747.80 --> 2747.92]  The
[2747.92 --> 2748.12]  Thing
[2748.12 --> 2748.38]  Is
[2748.38 --> 2748.72]  Jesus
[2748.72 --> 2749.14]  Doesn't
[2749.14 --> 2749.46]  Stop
[2749.46 --> 2749.74]  Here
[2749.74 --> 2750.72]  Right
[2750.72 --> 2750.88]  This
[2750.88 --> 2751.00]  Is
[2751.00 --> 2751.18]  Not
[2751.18 --> 2751.74]  All
[2751.74 --> 2752.54]  That
[2752.54 --> 2752.86]  Mercy
[2752.86 --> 2753.06]  Is
[2753.06 --> 2753.44]  About
[2753.44 --> 2754.48]  Jesus
[2754.48 --> 2754.94]  Pushes
[2754.94 --> 2755.26]  Further
[2755.26 --> 2755.46]  And
[2755.46 --> 2755.54]  He
[2755.54 --> 2755.86]  Pushes
[2755.86 --> 2756.44]  Deeper
[2756.44 --> 2756.98]  As

[2757.14 --> 2757.40]  Always
[2757.40 --> 2757.82]  Does
[2757.82 --> 2758.90]  He
[2758.90 --> 2759.20]  Shows

[2759.34 --> 2759.48]  That
[2759.48 --> 2759.78]  Mercy
[2759.78 --> 2759.96]  Is
[2759.96 --> 2760.34]  Also

[3408.78 --> 3409.12]  Week
[3409.12 --> 3409.78]  But
[3409.78 --> 3409.90]  It
[3409.90 --> 3410.00]  Will
[3410.00 --> 3410.18]  Be
[3410.18 --> 3410.46]  Such
[3410.46 --> 3410.60]  A
[3410.60 --> 3410.86]  Good
[3410.86 --> 3411.42]  Response
[3411.42 --> 3411.60]  For
[3411.60 --> 3411.74]  Our
[3411.74 --> 3411.98]  Sermon
[3411.98 --> 3412.38]  Today
[3412.38 --> 3412.68]  That
[3412.68 --> 3412.76]  We'll
[3412.76 --> 3412.88]  Sing
[3412.88 --> 3412.98]  It
[3412.98 --> 3413.16]  Again
[3413.16 --> 3413.92]  His
[3413.92 --> 3414.28]  Mercy
[3414.28 --> 3414.54]  Is
[3414.54 --> 3414.76]  More
[3414.76 --> 3415.30]  For
[3415.30 --> 3415.60] ��
[3415.60 --> 3439.16]  What love can remember no longs we have done
[3439.16 --> 3443.92]  All missions, all knowing, he counts on their song
[3443.92 --> 3449.46]  Floating to the sea without bottom or shore
[3449.46 --> 3455.16]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3455.16 --> 3467.10]  Our patience could wait as we constantly roam
[3467.10 --> 3471.88]  While Father so tender is calling us home
[3471.88 --> 3477.42]  He welcomes the weakest, the farthest, the poor
[3477.42 --> 3483.12]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3483.12 --> 3490.26]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor
[3490.26 --> 3497.56]  Stronger than darkness is you every morning
[3497.56 --> 3501.50]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3501.50 --> 3508.80]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor
[3508.80 --> 3516.10]  Stronger than darkness is you every morning
[3516.10 --> 3520.04]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3520.04 --> 3528.58]  What riches of kindness he lavished on us
[3528.58 --> 3533.12]  His blood was the payment, his life was the cost
[3533.12 --> 3538.82]  He stood near the dead, he could never afford
[3538.82 --> 3544.40]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3544.40 --> 3551.70]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor
[3551.70 --> 3562.94]  Stronger than darkness is you every morning
[3562.94 --> 3568.48]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor
[3568.48 --> 3572.48]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor
[3572.48 --> 3576.18]  Stronger than darkness is you every morning
[3576.18 --> 3582.10]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor
[3582.10 --> 3591.34]  Longer than darkness is you every morning
[3591.34 --> 3593.64]  We call the deacons forward for our offering
[3593.64 --> 3596.02]  Which this morning is for the cadet program
[3596.02 --> 3597.84]  And while the offering is being taken

[3863.92 --> 3865.92]  It's time for our community prayer.
[3865.92 --> 3869.56]  Just one thing that didn't make it in the bulletin, and we just heard this morning that Harriet
[3869.56 --> 3876.56]  DeBoer has been called back to Vernon, where her mother is failing, so we want to remember
[3876.56 --> 3879.56]  Alan Harriet in our prayer.
[3879.56 --> 3884.56]  The opening line of my prayer is from Psalm 5, and let us pray.
[3884.56 --> 3887.56]  We pray to you, O Lord.
[3887.56 --> 3889.56]  You hear our voice in the morning.
[3889.56 --> 3894.56]  At sunrise, we offer our prayers and wait for your answer.
[3894.56 --> 3897.56]  Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[3897.56 --> 3902.56]  You created us in your image, and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[3902.56 --> 3909.56]  We are thankful for the communities we live in, for services which we sometimes take for granted,
[3909.56 --> 3915.56]  for clean water, for public servants such as police, doctors, judges, nurses, firefighters,
[3915.56 --> 3919.56]  military personnel, and paramedics.
[3919.56 --> 3922.56]  May we be mindful of all these services we have.
[3922.56 --> 3927.56]  Bless all workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[3927.56 --> 3936.56]  We pray for those who work in agriculture, including farmers in our own church, who provide us with the daily necessities of life.
[3936.56 --> 3940.56]  We are thankful for your provision in this world.
[3940.56 --> 3943.56]  May we be good stewards of your creation.
[3943.56 --> 3953.56]  May we be good stewards of our nation, for our Prime Minister, our new Premier Ebey, and the mayors of the communities we represent, Delta and Richmond.
[3953.56 --> 3958.56]  Give them a sense of justice and provide them with wisdom for leadership.
[3958.56 --> 3965.50]  leadership. We pray for a broken world, for Christians around this world. We want to especially
[3965.50 --> 3972.80]  remember persecuted Christians in the country of Iran, which is also in turmoil at present.
[3972.80 --> 3978.78]  Protect your church there. We pray for a change of heart in the leadership of Iran to give
[3978.78 --> 3985.88]  more freedom to Christians and also to all citizens. We also pray for believers in Ethiopia
[3985.88 --> 3992.28]  and Nigeria. Bless your church in these countries where there is so much unrest. There are so
[3992.28 --> 3997.76]  many humanitarian crises around this world, it seems overwhelming. We think of Somalia,
[3997.76 --> 4005.74]  Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Haiti. Bless all initiatives to bring relief
[4005.74 --> 4012.82]  and peace to these places. Very much in our hearts is the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We
[4012.82 --> 4017.58]  see the images in the media and our hearts go out to all those who are uprooted. Millions
[4017.58 --> 4023.44]  have fled their homes and have become refugees. We pray for those providing short and long-term
[4023.44 --> 4030.32]  aid for those in need. Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating this violence and
[4030.32 --> 4036.36]  bring it to an end. Bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable
[4036.36 --> 4045.12]  conflicts. We pray for the nations as we see a rise in authoritarian power in many, many countries.
[4045.12 --> 4053.12]  We pray for our church. Bless our ministry leaders for Pastor Jason, Associate Pastor Nancy, and our
[4053.12 --> 4061.26]  church council. Also the many volunteers who are leading our programs. We want to recognize our cadet
[4061.26 --> 4067.76]  ministry this morning. We thank you for the leaders that have been so faithful over many years and bless
[4067.76 --> 4075.14]  their mission, their ministry and all the boys involved. Thank you of how you have blessed our
[4075.14 --> 4081.70]  Chinese ministry. May we continue to grow together so that we can become one body, getting to know each
[4081.70 --> 4087.42]  other better. And we are thankful that Nancy is recovering from surgery and is able to meet with us again.
[4087.42 --> 4096.42]  We pray for the ministries of our CRC denomination and our classes. Bless the ministries that we support,
[4096.42 --> 4103.42]  the Johnson's missionaries that we support, the Johnson's in Salmon Arm, and Najee and Ann and family in Cairo.
[4103.42 --> 4110.42]  We want to remember and bring before you the needs in our congregation for those seniors living in care homes.
[4110.42 --> 4123.42]  Others who need your healing are Grace and Grace, Pat, Amy, Jordan, Eileen, and Shirley. Lord, you know what each of these
[4123.42 --> 4132.42]  persons needs and we pray for their healing. We pray for Al and Harriet as they travel to Vernon to be with
[4132.42 --> 4139.42]  Harriet's mother who is failing. We pray that you'll comfort them during this difficult time.
[4139.42 --> 4146.42]  We also pray for Ellie and the recent loss of her brother Hank. We are thankful for the healing of Quinn
[4146.42 --> 4154.42]  after such a serious accident. Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts like mental
[4154.42 --> 4164.42]  illness and depression, addictions, and broken relationships and family and marriages.
[4164.42 --> 4171.42]  Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer
[4171.42 --> 4177.42]  and to live faithfully in response to your call. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[4177.42 --> 4193.42]  Will you please stand?
[4193.42 --> 4202.42]  Again, please join us for a time of fellowship and coffee right after the service. And if you are new here today,
[4202.42 --> 4206.42]  I would love to get to know you. So please do introduce yourself to me and others.
[4206.42 --> 4211.42]  And we'd love to welcome you to get involved in our church family.
[4211.42 --> 4215.42]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's benediction.
[4215.42 --> 4222.42]  Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault
[4222.42 --> 4230.42]  and with great joy. To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord
[4230.42 --> 4235.42]  before all ages and now and forevermore. Amen.
[4235.42 --> 4240.42]  Please remain standing and we will sing our final song as we prepare to leave.
[4240.42 --> 4241.42]  Let's pray.
[4241.42 --> 4242.42]  Let's pray.
[4242.42 --> 4243.42]  Let's pray.
