[323.42 --> 324.42]  Good morning.
[324.42 --> 328.42]  Welcome to worship at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[328.42 --> 341.42]  Our Heavenly Father welcomes you to his house, and we hope that you will find him as the source of life and health and peace that each one of us needs.
[341.42 --> 342.42]  My name is Jason Truel.
[342.42 --> 345.42]  I'm one of the pastors here, along with Pastor Nancy.
[345.42 --> 348.42]  And it is my pleasure this morning to lead us in worship.
[348.42 --> 353.42]  Later, Tim Sheridan will be preaching from God's word for us.
[353.42 --> 356.42]  And just two quick announcements.
[356.42 --> 372.42]  One is, and this was in your bulletin last week, but our basic skills camp that we were hoping to run for this summer, we have made the difficult decision to cancel just due to the lack of resources that we believe we need to run the camp.
[372.42 --> 375.42]  So that you don't need to save the date for that anymore.
[375.42 --> 376.42]  So that you don't need to save the date for that anymore.
[376.42 --> 383.42]  But we also pray that God would help us to care for our little ones whom we love and to help them to grow up in Christ.
[383.42 --> 393.42]  A second announcement is that there will be a memorial service for Marge DeLange, who is sister to Marian Van Toll.
[393.42 --> 400.42]  The worship service is on June 15, 2pm at Christ Church Cathedral.
[400.42 --> 403.42]  That is in downtown Vancouver.
[403.42 --> 409.42]  So Marge passed away peacefully after suffering from a brain aneurysm on June 3rd.
[409.42 --> 413.42]  And the DeLange's were former members of this church and had many friends here.
[413.42 --> 415.42]  So maybe some of you remember them or know them.
[415.42 --> 424.42]  So let's prepare our hearts as we come before the Lord in worship.
[424.42 --> 430.42]  And as we worship our God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we worship him together as one body.
[430.42 --> 437.42]  So please join me as we hear and respond to the call to worship this morning in the words of Psalm 100.
[437.42 --> 442.42]  So I will begin in where that has the two arrows.
[442.42 --> 445.42]  I'll invite you to read it out loud together.
[445.42 --> 448.42]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[448.42 --> 451.42]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[451.42 --> 454.42]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[454.42 --> 456.42]  Together.
[456.42 --> 458.42]  Know that the Lord is God.
[458.42 --> 462.42]  It is he who made us and we are his.
[462.42 --> 466.42]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[466.42 --> 471.42]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[471.42 --> 475.42]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[475.42 --> 480.42]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[480.42 --> 485.42]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[485.42 --> 487.42]  Let's pray together.
[487.42 --> 488.42]  Please join me in prayer.
[488.42 --> 494.42]  Almighty, merciful God,
[494.42 --> 502.42]  merciful God, we come before you as a very small part of your very large body.
[502.42 --> 506.42]  A holy fellowship that stretches to every corner of the earth.
[506.42 --> 516.42]  We celebrate you this morning as the great and good king over all the universe and over your chosen queen, the church.
[516.42 --> 521.42]  We gather as your chosen bride, poor and sinful as we are.
[521.42 --> 530.42]  But you have loved us and made us rich and pure by your abundant grace, shown to the world on Calvary by the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf.
[531.42 --> 533.42]  Shape us this morning, O God.
[533.42 --> 539.42]  Cause us to listen to you, sing to you, obey and love you with our whole being.
[539.42 --> 544.42]  Inform within us hearts that are grateful in all things.
[544.42 --> 547.42]  Minds that fearlessly accept your truth.
[547.42 --> 551.42]  And bodies that go into the world to do your will.
[551.42 --> 556.42]  This day, Lord, by your spirit, would you be present and active among us for your glory.
[556.42 --> 559.42]  Blessed are you, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[559.42 --> 562.42]  And blessed be your kingdom now and forever.
[562.42 --> 565.42]  We pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[565.42 --> 566.42]  Amen.
[566.42 --> 568.42]  Brothers and sisters, please rise.
[568.42 --> 572.42]  And hear God's greeting to us this morning.
[572.42 --> 581.42]  Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.
[581.42 --> 587.42]  For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime.
[587.42 --> 593.42]  Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
[593.42 --> 600.42]  As our God has welcomed us and has greeted us, so would you now turn and greet one another?
[600.42 --> 602.42]  In the name of Christ.
[602.42 --> 603.42]  Welcome those around you.
[630.42 --> 631.42]  Welcome those around you.
[631.42 --> 632.42]  Thank you so much.
[632.42 --> 633.42]  Thank you so much.
[633.42 --> 634.42]  Thank you so much.
[634.42 --> 635.42]  Thank you so much.
[635.42 --> 661.42]  Blessed be your name in the land that is plentiful,
[661.42 --> 665.42]  When streams above the depths flow,
[666.42 --> 669.42]  Blessed be your name.
[671.42 --> 678.42]  Blessed be your name when you come to the desert place,
[679.42 --> 682.42]  For all through the wilderness,
[683.42 --> 686.42]  Blessed be your name.
[686.42 --> 695.42]  Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise,
[696.42 --> 702.42]  When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say,
[703.42 --> 706.42]  Blessed be the name of the Lord,
[707.42 --> 710.42]  Blessed be your name.
[710.42 --> 715.42]  Blessed be your name,
[715.42 --> 720.42]  Blessed be your glorious day.
[720.42 --> 723.42]  Blessed be your name,
[723.42 --> 726.42]  Blessed be your name,
[727.42 --> 730.42]  For the sun's shining down on me,
[731.42 --> 735.42]  For the world's all as it should be,
[736.42 --> 738.42]  Blessed be your name.
[738.42 --> 742.42]  Blessed be your name,
[742.42 --> 743.42]  Blessed be your name,
[744.42 --> 748.42]  For the road, Lord, till some fury,
[749.42 --> 752.42]  For what's made in the offering,
[753.42 --> 755.42]  Blessed be your name.
[755.42 --> 762.10]  Every blessing you pour out
[762.10 --> 766.86]  I'll turn back to grace
[766.86 --> 771.18]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[771.18 --> 773.92]  Still I will stay
[773.92 --> 778.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[778.12 --> 782.18]  Blessed be your name
[782.18 --> 786.42]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[786.42 --> 791.42]  Blessed be your glorious name
[791.42 --> 797.66]  You give and take away
[797.66 --> 802.26]  You give and take away
[802.26 --> 806.86]  My heart will choose to say
[806.86 --> 811.14]  Blessed be your name
[811.14 --> 815.38]  You give and take away
[815.38 --> 819.80]  You give and take away
[819.80 --> 824.38]  My heart will choose to say
[824.38 --> 829.38]  Oh, blessed be your name
[829.38 --> 834.32]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[834.32 --> 837.56]  Blessed be your name
[837.56 --> 842.78]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[842.78 --> 847.56]  Blessed be your glorious name
[847.56 --> 852.80]  Amen
[852.80 --> 852.86]  Amen
[852.86 --> 855.60]  Enjoy your name
[855.60 --> 857.10]  Amen
[857.10 --> 859.66]  Amen
[859.66 --> 870.10]  Amen
[870.10 --> 870.28]  Amen
[870.28 --> 871.10]  Amen
[871.10 --> 875.72] joy
[875.72 --> 884.00]  O for a thousand tongues to sing
[884.00 --> 888.90]  My great Redeemer's praise
[888.90 --> 894.04]  The glories of my God and King
[894.04 --> 899.94]  The triumphs of His praise
[899.94 --> 905.68]  My gracious Master and my God
[905.68 --> 909.94]  Blesses me to proclaim
[909.94 --> 914.94]  To spread through all the earth abroad
[915.46 --> 920.88]  We all hearts of God lay
[920.88 --> 927.34]  Jesus, the name that charms our fears
[927.34 --> 932.14]  That builds our sorrow cease
[932.14 --> 937.08]  Tis music in the city
[937.08 --> 943.42]  Tis life and health and peace
[943.42 --> 949.22]  He breaks the power of canceled sin
[949.22 --> 953.34]  He sets the prison free
[953.34 --> 959.14]  His blood can make the foulest free
[959.14 --> 965.08]  He is one of them for me
[965.08 --> 971.14]  Clear in He death, His praise He done
[971.14 --> 976.08]  Your loves and tongues and wine
[976.08 --> 980.88]  He might behold, our Savior come
[980.88 --> 986.82]  And leave me late for joy
[986.82 --> 993.88]  Glory to God and praise and love
[993.88 --> 998.88]  We ever, ever give
[998.88 --> 1004.68]  My saints below and saints above
[1004.68 --> 1010.62]  The church in earth and heaven
[1010.62 --> 1015.36]  Thank you. May be seated.
[1021.36 --> 1025.08]  As we move into a time of confession this morning,
[1026.02 --> 1029.36]  what I'd like to do is I will read Psalm 116,
[1030.10 --> 1032.96]  the first nine verses to open us.
[1033.54 --> 1037.70]  Then I will give you time for silent confession.
[1037.70 --> 1042.90]  So hear these words from Psalm 116.
[1045.04 --> 1049.00]  I love the Lord, for He heard my voice.
[1049.78 --> 1051.84]  He heard my cry for mercy.
[1052.84 --> 1055.40]  Because He turned His ear to me,
[1055.82 --> 1059.26]  I will call on Him as long as I live.
[1060.56 --> 1062.98]  The cords of death entangled me.
[1062.98 --> 1066.50]  The anguish of the grave came over me.
[1067.30 --> 1070.94]  I was overcome by distress and sorrow.
[1071.68 --> 1073.74]  Then I called on the name of the Lord.
[1073.96 --> 1075.18]  Lord, save me!
[1076.44 --> 1078.78]  The Lord is gracious and righteous.
[1079.74 --> 1081.92]  Our God is full of compassion.
[1083.02 --> 1085.10]  The Lord protects the unwary.
[1085.10 --> 1089.12]  When I was brought low, He saved me.
[1090.56 --> 1093.30]  Return to your rest, my soul.
[1093.90 --> 1096.38]  For the Lord has been good to you.
[1097.64 --> 1100.76]  For you, Lord, have delivered me from death,
[1101.14 --> 1104.12]  my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling,
[1104.58 --> 1106.46]  that I may walk before the Lord
[1106.46 --> 1108.92]  in the land of the living.
[1108.92 --> 1112.98]  Let's come before our gracious and righteous God,
[1113.32 --> 1114.76]  who is full of compassion,
[1115.56 --> 1117.94]  silently confess the ways we have sinned against Him
[1117.94 --> 1119.30]  and each other.
[1119.48 --> 1119.96]  Let's pray.
[1119.96 --> 1120.00]  Let's pray.
[1120.00 --> 1120.04]  Let's pray.
[1138.92 --> 1151.96]  Let's pray.
[1151.96 --> 1152.46]  Let's pray.
[1153.52 --> 1156.00]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the grace
[1156.00 --> 1157.74]  which allows us to come before you
[1157.74 --> 1162.76]  in honesty of who we are because of our sin,
[1162.88 --> 1166.28]  but in great hope because of what you have accomplished for us
[1166.28 --> 1168.34]  through your death and resurrection.
[1169.52 --> 1173.86]  Father, when our feet wander from you,
[1174.02 --> 1175.72]  you restore us to passive righteousness.
[1176.84 --> 1179.56]  When, Lord, we are bound by sin, you set us free.
[1181.24 --> 1184.32]  And, Lord, we ask that you would cleanse our hearts,
[1184.68 --> 1188.14]  that we might live more fully and more freely
[1188.14 --> 1190.46]  according to your ways,
[1191.08 --> 1193.10]  following our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1193.10 --> 1196.24]  for your glory and for the good of the world.
[1196.66 --> 1197.98]  Lord, we pray in Jesus' name.
[1198.48 --> 1198.80]  Amen.
[1199.92 --> 1204.42]  Let's hear now these joyous words of forgiveness from Psalm 62.
[1205.98 --> 1209.28]  Find rest, O my soul, in God alone.
[1210.08 --> 1211.90]  My hope comes from Him.
[1212.80 --> 1215.78]  He alone is my rock and my salvation.
[1216.60 --> 1217.78]  He is my fortress.
[1217.92 --> 1218.98]  I will not be shaken.
[1220.02 --> 1222.78]  My salvation and my honor depend on God.
[1222.78 --> 1227.14]  He is my mighty rock, my refuge.
[1228.18 --> 1230.50]  Trust in Him at all times, O people.
[1231.24 --> 1232.72]  Pour out your hearts to Him,
[1233.22 --> 1235.64]  for God is our refuge.
[1235.64 --> 1240.68]  Let's stand and let's sing together of God's grace to us.
[1240.68 --> 1241.54]  Please rise.
[1241.54 --> 1250.00]  You are my strength when I am weak.
[1250.00 --> 1267.36]  You are the treasure that I seek.
[1267.36 --> 1268.36]  You are my all in all.
[1268.36 --> 1272.36]  You are my all in all.
[1272.36 --> 1277.36]  Seeking you as a precious jewel.
[1277.36 --> 1281.24]  Lord, to give love might be a fool.
[1281.24 --> 1286.36]  You are my all in all.
[1286.36 --> 1293.36]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1293.36 --> 1294.36]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1294.36 --> 1308.36]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1308.36 --> 1313.36]  Worthy is our name.
[1313.36 --> 1315.36]  You are my all in all.
[1315.36 --> 1319.36]  Taking my sin, my cross, my shame.
[1319.36 --> 1322.86]  Rising again, I bless your name.
[1322.86 --> 1327.36]  You are my all in all.
[1329.36 --> 1333.36]  When I fall down, you pick me up.
[1333.36 --> 1336.74]  When I am trying, tell my cup.
[1336.74 --> 1341.74]  You are my all in all.
[1341.74 --> 1349.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1349.74 --> 1355.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1355.74 --> 1360.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1360.74 --> 1368.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1368.74 --> 1376.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1376.74 --> 1380.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1380.74 --> 1381.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1381.74 --> 1383.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1383.74 --> 1385.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1385.74 --> 1386.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1386.74 --> 1391.74]  Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1391.74 --> 1400.74]  Worthy is your name.
[1400.74 --> 1405.74]  Lamb of God
[1405.74 --> 1413.12]  Worthy is your name
[1413.12 --> 1415.86]  Jesus
[1415.86 --> 1420.96]  Lamb of God
[1420.96 --> 1426.96]  Worthy is your name
[1430.74 --> 1450.56]  Brothers and sisters
[1450.56 --> 1452.68]  we continue to worship the Lord
[1452.68 --> 1455.54]  by receiving his invitation
[1455.54 --> 1458.92]  to feast with him at his table
[1458.92 --> 1460.96]  but before we do so
[1460.96 --> 1463.30]  let us profess the faith
[1463.30 --> 1464.76]  that we hold together
[1464.76 --> 1467.68]  not only together as a local church
[1467.68 --> 1469.24]  but with our brothers and sisters
[1469.24 --> 1471.68]  around the world and throughout the centuries
[1471.68 --> 1474.18]  by reciting together
[1474.18 --> 1475.82]  the Apostles' Creed
[1475.82 --> 1480.54]  let's say this together
[1480.54 --> 1482.94]  I believe in God
[1482.94 --> 1484.42]  the Father Almighty
[1484.42 --> 1487.30]  creator of heaven and earth
[1487.30 --> 1489.88]  I believe in Jesus Christ
[1489.88 --> 1491.36]  his only Son
[1491.36 --> 1492.22]  our Lord
[1492.22 --> 1495.10]  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
[1495.10 --> 1497.80]  and born of the Virgin Mary
[1497.80 --> 1500.96]  he suffered under Pontius Pilate
[1500.96 --> 1502.34]  was crucified
[1502.34 --> 1504.50]  died and was buried
[1504.50 --> 1506.68]  he descended to hell
[1506.68 --> 1508.48]  the third day
[1508.48 --> 1510.54]  he rose again from the dead
[1510.54 --> 1512.54]  he ascended to heaven
[1512.54 --> 1515.14]  and is seated at the right hand
[1515.14 --> 1515.88]  of God
[1515.88 --> 1517.18]  the Father Almighty
[1517.18 --> 1518.86]  from there
[1518.86 --> 1520.42]  he will come to judge
[1520.42 --> 1521.08]  the living
[1521.08 --> 1522.18]  and the dead
[1522.18 --> 1525.04]  I believe in the Holy Spirit
[1525.04 --> 1527.50]  the Holy Catholic Church
[1527.50 --> 1529.60]  the communion of saints
[1529.60 --> 1531.76]  the forgiveness of sins
[1531.76 --> 1534.12]  the resurrection of the body
[1534.12 --> 1536.44]  and the life everlasting
[1536.44 --> 1537.72]  Amen
[1537.72 --> 1540.66]  Let's come before the Lord
[1540.66 --> 1541.80]  in prayer together
[1541.80 --> 1542.58]  let's pray
[1542.58 --> 1545.70]  Heavenly Father
[1545.70 --> 1545.74]  Heavenly Father
[1545.74 --> 1548.56]  you have created everything
[1548.56 --> 1550.78]  for the sake of your name
[1550.78 --> 1554.42]  and have given men, women, and children everywhere
[1554.42 --> 1556.88]  food and drink to enjoy
[1556.88 --> 1558.70]  that they may thank you
[1558.70 --> 1560.68]  but to us
[1560.68 --> 1563.06]  you have given spiritual food
[1563.06 --> 1564.70]  and spiritual drink
[1564.70 --> 1566.44]  and eternal life
[1566.44 --> 1568.18]  through Jesus our Lord
[1568.18 --> 1570.56]  we thank you
[1570.56 --> 1571.34]  Holy Father
[1571.34 --> 1573.28]  for your sacred name
[1573.28 --> 1574.40]  which you have lodged
[1574.40 --> 1575.26]  in our hearts
[1575.26 --> 1577.06]  and for the knowledge
[1577.06 --> 1578.40]  faith and immortality
[1578.40 --> 1579.44]  which you have revealed
[1579.44 --> 1581.16]  through Jesus your Son
[1581.16 --> 1583.90]  remember Lord your church
[1583.90 --> 1586.10]  to save it from all evil
[1586.10 --> 1587.76]  and to make it perfect
[1587.76 --> 1588.68]  by your love
[1588.68 --> 1590.48]  make it holy
[1590.48 --> 1592.14]  and gather it together
[1592.14 --> 1593.54]  from the four winds
[1593.54 --> 1595.06]  into your kingdom
[1595.06 --> 1597.48]  which you have made ready for it
[1597.48 --> 1599.00]  for yours
[1599.00 --> 1599.66]  oh God
[1599.66 --> 1600.38]  is the power
[1600.38 --> 1602.10]  and the glory forever
[1602.10 --> 1603.52]  Amen
[1603.52 --> 1606.58]  Brothers and sisters
[1606.58 --> 1608.88]  this meal that we are about to eat together
[1608.88 --> 1611.22]  is a preview of something
[1611.22 --> 1612.54]  it is a preview
[1612.54 --> 1614.44]  of the marriage supper
[1614.44 --> 1615.28]  of the Lamb
[1615.28 --> 1617.06]  that we will eat one day
[1617.06 --> 1618.86]  in God's eternal kingdom
[1618.86 --> 1621.50]  but as we wait for that day
[1621.50 --> 1623.12]  in this meal
[1623.12 --> 1624.88]  that we celebrate together
[1624.88 --> 1625.78]  Christ
[1625.78 --> 1627.62]  Christ nourishes us
[1627.62 --> 1628.66]  he nourishes us
[1628.66 --> 1630.36]  through his body
[1630.36 --> 1632.10]  and his blood
[1632.10 --> 1634.94]  for that reason
[1634.94 --> 1636.90]  this meal is for those
[1636.90 --> 1638.78]  who have committed themselves
[1638.78 --> 1639.56]  to Jesus
[1639.56 --> 1641.72]  for those who have been washed
[1641.72 --> 1643.16]  in the waters of baptism
[1643.16 --> 1645.74]  if that's not yet
[1645.74 --> 1646.94]  who you are
[1646.94 --> 1648.40]  we are glad that you are here
[1648.40 --> 1649.62]  we are so glad that you're here
[1649.62 --> 1651.24]  and we invite you
[1651.24 --> 1652.68]  to think about how Jesus
[1652.68 --> 1654.52]  is the one
[1654.52 --> 1656.00]  the only one
[1656.00 --> 1656.84]  who can fill
[1656.84 --> 1658.48]  our deepest longings
[1658.48 --> 1660.52]  but if you have
[1660.52 --> 1661.66]  committed yourself
[1661.66 --> 1662.34]  to Christ
[1662.34 --> 1664.08]  then he bids you
[1664.08 --> 1664.64]  to come
[1664.64 --> 1665.80]  to feast
[1665.80 --> 1666.42]  with him
[1666.42 --> 1667.30]  at this meal
[1667.30 --> 1669.84]  parents of young children
[1669.84 --> 1670.48]  we leave it
[1670.48 --> 1671.86]  to your discretion
[1671.86 --> 1673.46]  to serve the elements
[1673.46 --> 1674.14]  to your children
[1674.14 --> 1675.32]  if you believe that
[1675.32 --> 1676.70]  they have a
[1676.70 --> 1678.08]  an age appropriate
[1678.08 --> 1679.06]  understanding
[1679.06 --> 1679.94]  and faith
[1679.94 --> 1680.72]  in Christ
[1680.72 --> 1682.74]  as we all do
[1682.74 --> 1683.74]  as we come to the table
[1683.74 --> 1684.62]  not perfectly
[1684.62 --> 1685.70]  but
[1685.70 --> 1686.70]  by the grace
[1686.70 --> 1687.88]  that God has given us
[1687.88 --> 1693.80]  the Lord Jesus
[1693.80 --> 1696.48]  and we'll put the words up here
[1696.48 --> 1697.40]  the Lord Jesus
[1697.40 --> 1697.92]  on the night
[1697.92 --> 1698.76]  when he was betrayed
[1698.76 --> 1699.66]  took bread
[1699.66 --> 1701.70]  and when he had given thanks
[1701.70 --> 1702.42]  he broke it
[1702.42 --> 1702.96]  and said
[1702.96 --> 1704.58]  this is my body
[1704.58 --> 1705.86]  which is for you
[1705.86 --> 1707.22]  do this
[1707.22 --> 1707.96]  in remembrance
[1707.96 --> 1708.58]  of me
[1708.58 --> 1710.56]  in the same way
[1710.56 --> 1711.28]  after supper
[1711.28 --> 1712.24]  he took the cup
[1712.24 --> 1713.22]  saying
[1713.22 --> 1714.46]  this cup
[1714.46 --> 1715.30]  is a new covenant
[1715.30 --> 1716.98]  in my blood
[1716.98 --> 1718.44]  do this
[1718.44 --> 1719.62]  whenever you drink it
[1719.62 --> 1720.78]  in remembrance of me
[1720.78 --> 1722.30]  for whenever
[1722.30 --> 1723.86]  you eat this bread
[1723.86 --> 1725.64]  and drink this cup
[1725.64 --> 1726.74]  you proclaim
[1726.74 --> 1727.58]  the Lord's death
[1727.58 --> 1729.28]  until he comes
[1729.28 --> 1734.00]  brothers and sisters
[1734.00 --> 1738.12]  go to the next part
[1738.12 --> 1739.78]  there it is
[1739.78 --> 1741.36]  lift up your hearts
[1741.36 --> 1743.18]  lift up your hearts
[1743.18 --> 1746.44]  we are his people
[1746.44 --> 1750.92]  let us proclaim
[1750.92 --> 1752.32]  the mystery of faith
[1752.32 --> 1754.20]  Christ has died
[1754.20 --> 1755.76]  Christ is risen
[1755.76 --> 1757.74]  Christ will come again
[1757.74 --> 1759.86]  Christ our Passover
[1759.86 --> 1761.96]  has been sacrificed for us
[1761.96 --> 1762.88]  hallelujah
[1762.88 --> 1763.88]  Hallelujah.
[1764.80 --> 1768.82]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[1769.32 --> 1774.54]  Take them and feed on him in your hearts by faith with great thanksgiving,
[1775.28 --> 1779.08]  knowing and believing that Jesus Christ died for you.
[1780.46 --> 1784.70]  May I now invite the elders and deacons who are serving to come forward
[1784.70 --> 1786.46]  and help me distribute the elements.
[1786.56 --> 1792.64]  So while the elements are being passed, you may take this time to pray to God,
[1792.64 --> 1794.14]  have a time of silent meditation.
[1794.66 --> 1799.86]  You can also follow along and sing as we can do together.
[1822.64 --> 1824.64]  Amen.
[1824.64 --> 1825.64]  Amen.
[1854.64 --> 1865.86]  Child of meekness, watch and pray, find in me that all in all.
[1866.78 --> 1875.52]  Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[1875.52 --> 1886.92]  Sin hath left a crimson stain, he washed in white as snow.
[1888.20 --> 1903.08]  Lord, now indeed I find, thy power and thy love can change the helper's thoughts.
[1903.08 --> 1918.08]  And let the heart of stone, Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[1919.56 --> 1930.24]  Sin hath left a crimson stain, he washed in white as snow.
[1933.08 --> 1938.08]  Sin hath left a crimson stain, he washed in white as snow.
[1938.08 --> 1940.08]  Amen.

[1993.46 --> 1996.42]  that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken for us.

[2136.72 --> 2143.58]  Still had left the crimson stain
[2143.58 --> 2149.34]  He watched it plain as snow
[2161.16 --> 2191.14]  He watched it plain as snow
[2191.16 --> 2221.14]  He watched it plain as snow
[2221.14 --> 2223.14]  He watched it plain as snow
[2223.14 --> 2225.14]  He watched it plain as snow
[2225.14 --> 2227.14]  Let's drink together
[2227.14 --> 2237.14]  Would you please join me in prayer
[2237.14 --> 2240.84]  What amazing love
[2240.84 --> 2242.70]  What amazing grace, O Lord
[2242.70 --> 2247.06]  That even while we were dead in our sins
[2247.06 --> 2248.68]  Even while we were your enemies
[2248.68 --> 2252.64]  You came and you pursued us in your love
[2252.64 --> 2255.76]  And Lord, you died in our place
[2255.76 --> 2257.56]  And rose from the dead
[2257.56 --> 2259.06]  That you might take us
[2259.06 --> 2261.82]  And raise us also to new life in you
[2261.82 --> 2264.84]  Lord, we thank you for this gift
[2264.84 --> 2266.32]  Of holy communion
[2266.32 --> 2267.80]  By which you strengthen us
[2267.80 --> 2268.88]  By your grace
[2268.88 --> 2270.70]  That we might follow you more faithfully
[2270.70 --> 2272.98]  And Lord, would you continue
[2272.98 --> 2274.66]  To do your work amongst us
[2274.66 --> 2275.30]  And in us
[2275.30 --> 2277.44]  Conforming each one of us
[2277.44 --> 2279.96]  Into the image of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2279.96 --> 2282.36]  And we pray in His holy name
[2282.36 --> 2283.02]  Amen
[2283.02 --> 2290.68]  May I invite the children
[2290.68 --> 2291.86]  To join me down here
[2291.86 --> 2292.90]  For a children's message
[2292.90 --> 2312.94]  You lost your shoe
[2312.94 --> 2320.94]  Hello, come on up
[2320.94 --> 2323.34]  Come sit over here
[2323.34 --> 2324.16]  Sit over here
[2324.16 --> 2324.70]  Sit over here
[2324.70 --> 2325.32]  Hello
[2325.32 --> 2326.18]  Sit down
[2326.18 --> 2328.68]  Want to join us over here?
[2330.00 --> 2330.42]  Alright
[2330.42 --> 2332.44]  We got everyone?
[2332.90 --> 2333.22]  Hello
[2333.22 --> 2334.58]  How are you all today?
[2334.92 --> 2335.32]  Good
[2335.32 --> 2335.86]  Good
[2335.86 --> 2338.90]  I want to show you what I have
[2338.90 --> 2340.46]  A plant
[2340.46 --> 2340.94]  Yeah
[2340.94 --> 2342.08]  You know what?
[2342.86 --> 2343.98]  It smells really good
[2343.98 --> 2345.12]  Do you want to smell?
[2345.38 --> 2346.00]  And see?
[2346.16 --> 2346.38]  Okay
[2346.38 --> 2349.16]  Yeah
[2349.16 --> 2351.72]  Alright
[2351.72 --> 2354.14]  I don't know if you can smell
[2354.14 --> 2355.18]  Here you go
[2355.18 --> 2356.28]  Come over
[2356.28 --> 2356.90]  Have a sniff
[2356.90 --> 2359.62]  Okay
[2359.62 --> 2359.96]  Now
[2359.96 --> 2360.56]  Here
[2360.56 --> 2361.92]  Here it is
[2361.92 --> 2362.66]  Do you all know
[2362.66 --> 2363.70]  What this is?
[2364.28 --> 2365.60]  Are you gardeners?
[2366.74 --> 2367.62]  Are you
[2367.62 --> 2368.58]  Are you chefs?
[2369.70 --> 2370.20]  Do you like
[2370.20 --> 2371.58]  I have my own
[2371.58 --> 2372.22]  It's peppermint
[2372.22 --> 2374.58]  You are right
[2374.58 --> 2375.62]  It's mint
[2375.62 --> 2376.86]  Yeah
[2376.86 --> 2377.38]  Do you want to smell?
[2377.38 --> 2378.42]  I have my own tomato
[2378.42 --> 2379.48]  You have a tomato plant
[2379.48 --> 2379.76]  Awesome
[2379.76 --> 2381.46]  So I got this last week
[2381.46 --> 2383.12]  It's still kind of a baby mint plant
[2383.12 --> 2384.48]  But hopefully it will grow and grow
[2384.48 --> 2385.40]  And then
[2385.40 --> 2386.44]  You know what you can do with this?
[2386.60 --> 2388.02]  You can make tea
[2388.02 --> 2389.46]  With it
[2389.46 --> 2389.98]  Mint tea
[2389.98 --> 2391.06]  Or you can
[2391.06 --> 2392.86]  Cook with it
[2392.86 --> 2393.76]  You can throw it
[2393.76 --> 2394.02]  Yeah
[2394.02 --> 2394.62]  That's good
[2394.62 --> 2397.26]  It reminded me
[2397.26 --> 2398.64]  Of a verse
[2398.64 --> 2398.84]  That
[2398.84 --> 2400.34]  This verse
[2400.34 --> 2401.10]  Might be hard
[2401.10 --> 2403.34]  But it's one verse
[2403.34 --> 2404.12]  I want to share with you
[2404.12 --> 2404.86]  That Jesus said
[2404.86 --> 2406.76]  First he said
[2406.76 --> 2407.86]  Ready?
[2407.98 --> 2408.14]  Listen
[2408.14 --> 2408.52]  He said
[2408.52 --> 2410.48]  Woe to you
[2410.48 --> 2411.46]  Teachers of the law
[2411.46 --> 2412.10]  And Pharisees
[2412.10 --> 2413.18]  Woe means
[2413.18 --> 2414.38]  Be careful
[2414.38 --> 2415.02]  Watch out
[2415.02 --> 2416.36]  You're in danger
[2416.36 --> 2417.20]  Okay
[2417.20 --> 2417.92]  So Jesus says
[2417.92 --> 2418.74]  Woe to you
[2418.74 --> 2419.78]  Because
[2419.78 --> 2420.90]  Why does he say that?
[2420.90 --> 2424.48]  You give a tenth of your mint
[2424.48 --> 2427.30]  But you neglect
[2427.30 --> 2430.70]  The more important matters of the law
[2430.70 --> 2433.12]  Justice, mercy, and faithfulness
[2433.12 --> 2434.88]  So what does he mean by that?
[2435.64 --> 2439.70]  Sometimes we want to give God things
[2439.70 --> 2442.70]  But what God really wants
[2442.70 --> 2444.72]  Is our hearts
[2444.72 --> 2446.36]  He wants us to love him
[2446.36 --> 2447.22]  And to love others
[2447.22 --> 2449.06]  And he wants us to be faithful to him
[2449.06 --> 2451.06]  And then Jesus says
[2451.06 --> 2452.00]  You should do both
[2452.00 --> 2453.00]  You should
[2453.00 --> 2454.20]  We should give to God
[2454.20 --> 2455.06]  Our mint
[2455.06 --> 2457.04]  Our money
[2457.04 --> 2458.88]  Our service
[2458.88 --> 2459.32]  Everything
[2459.32 --> 2461.26]  We should do our best in life
[2461.26 --> 2463.34]  In the life that God has given us
[2463.34 --> 2464.20]  But he also
[2464.20 --> 2465.42]  What he really wants
[2465.42 --> 2466.88]  Is our hearts
[2466.88 --> 2467.66]  Can you remember that?
[2467.72 --> 2468.76]  What does God want from us?
[2469.74 --> 2470.64]  Our hearts
[2470.64 --> 2470.94]  Right?
[2471.02 --> 2472.58]  He wants us to love him and others
[2472.58 --> 2473.38]  And to be faithful
[2473.38 --> 2474.46]  Okay?
[2474.74 --> 2476.76]  So when I look at a mint plant
[2476.76 --> 2478.68]  It's a reminder to me
[2478.68 --> 2480.66]  That Jesus wants us
[2480.66 --> 2482.24]  To love him and be faithful to him
[2482.24 --> 2483.06]  Okay?
[2483.14 --> 2483.72]  Can you remember that?
[2483.74 --> 2485.24]  When you see a mint plant?
[2487.02 --> 2488.38]  God wants us to love him
[2488.38 --> 2488.86]  Okay?
[2489.90 --> 2490.74]  You can touch it
[2490.74 --> 2491.42]  Okay
[2491.42 --> 2492.50]  Alright, let's pray
[2492.50 --> 2494.44]  Father, we thank you
[2494.44 --> 2496.24]  For the reminder of the mint
[2496.24 --> 2498.62]  That you call us to love you
[2498.62 --> 2500.82]  To pursue justice and faithfulness
[2500.82 --> 2503.12]  And Lord, would you help us to remember
[2503.12 --> 2505.56]  When we see this little plant
[2505.56 --> 2506.94]  We pray in Jesus' name
[2506.94 --> 2507.38]  Amen
[2507.38 --> 2508.54]  Okay
[2508.54 --> 2510.26]  You may return to your seats
[2510.26 --> 2511.12]  Thank you
[2511.12 --> 2516.10]  Okay
[2516.10 --> 2533.28]  So at this time
[2533.28 --> 2533.78]  Oops, sorry
[2533.78 --> 2541.42]  To their Sunday school classes
[2541.42 --> 2542.14]  Our man
[2542.14 --> 2558.18]  Alright
[2558.18 --> 2561.52]  I want to briefly introduce
[2561.52 --> 2563.06]  Our guest preacher for today
[2563.06 --> 2565.56]  Is Pastor Tim Sheridan
[2565.56 --> 2567.96]  Tim was the pastor
[2567.96 --> 2570.42]  Most recently at Maple Ridge CRC
[2570.42 --> 2571.76]  He was there for over 10 years
[2571.76 --> 2574.20]  And just over a year ago
[2574.20 --> 2576.60]  He took the position
[2576.60 --> 2578.20]  And God's leading
[2578.20 --> 2580.44]  To serve with Resonate Global Mission
[2580.44 --> 2582.38]  As the director of church planting
[2582.38 --> 2584.06]  And so it is our privilege
[2584.06 --> 2586.94]  To hear God's word from him today
[2586.94 --> 2588.62]  And I hope he will also tell us more
[2588.62 --> 2589.46]  About what he does
[2589.46 --> 2591.46]  In terms of his church planting ministry
[2591.46 --> 2592.34]  Okay
[2592.34 --> 2602.34]  Thanks
[2602.34 --> 2604.10]  It's a joy to be with you
[2604.10 --> 2605.16]  This morning
[2605.16 --> 2606.58]  And yeah
[2606.58 --> 2608.20]  Jason asked if I could just share
[2608.20 --> 2610.04]  A little bit about what I do now
[2610.04 --> 2612.06]  After being a pastor
[2612.06 --> 2614.28]  For over 23 years
[2614.28 --> 2616.00]  I have
[2616.00 --> 2616.84]  I'm still really
[2616.84 --> 2617.60]  To be honest
[2617.60 --> 2618.58]  It's only a year in
[2618.58 --> 2620.38]  In the middle of a major transition
[2620.38 --> 2621.98]  Serving in a different capacity
[2621.98 --> 2623.76]  But it's a real joy
[2623.76 --> 2625.18]  Resonate Global Mission
[2625.18 --> 2626.82]  Works across the globe
[2626.82 --> 2627.94]  As the name suggests
[2627.94 --> 2631.50]  14 regions scattered across our globe
[2631.50 --> 2631.96]  In which
[2631.96 --> 2634.86]  We are active partnering with God
[2634.86 --> 2636.32]  And the spirit to plant churches
[2636.32 --> 2638.28]  And just actually
[2638.28 --> 2639.34]  A little over a week ago
[2639.34 --> 2640.12]  We had the privilege
[2640.12 --> 2640.86]  To gather
[2640.86 --> 2642.42]  About 80 of us
[2642.42 --> 2643.14]  In New Jersey
[2643.14 --> 2644.62]  From all over North America
[2644.62 --> 2646.28]  To share stories
[2646.28 --> 2646.88]  And fellowship
[2646.88 --> 2648.20]  Of what God is doing
[2648.20 --> 2649.80]  And if you caught
[2649.80 --> 2650.90]  I don't know if
[2650.90 --> 2652.06]  This congregation
[2652.06 --> 2653.06]  Well of course
[2653.06 --> 2653.70]  But if anyone
[2653.70 --> 2654.52]  In this congregation
[2654.52 --> 2656.12]  Reads a magazine
[2656.12 --> 2657.10]  Of our denomination
[2657.10 --> 2658.04]  Called the banner
[2658.04 --> 2659.88]  In the March edition
[2659.88 --> 2660.80]  Of this past year
[2660.80 --> 2661.98]  There was a cover story
[2661.98 --> 2663.34]  About the growing diversity
[2663.34 --> 2665.18]  In our denomination
[2665.18 --> 2666.48]  That's really reflected
[2666.48 --> 2667.44]  In our church planting
[2667.44 --> 2669.80]  And that was so much the case
[2669.80 --> 2670.74]  At this gathering
[2670.74 --> 2671.90]  We had about a week ago
[2671.90 --> 2672.62]  We
[2672.62 --> 2674.20]  At the end of our time
[2674.20 --> 2675.34]  We shared in some scripture
[2675.34 --> 2675.82]  And
[2675.82 --> 2677.38]  People were invited
[2677.38 --> 2678.70]  To read the scriptures
[2678.70 --> 2679.62]  In their own language
[2679.62 --> 2681.42]  And almost a dozen languages
[2681.42 --> 2682.08]  Were spoken
[2682.08 --> 2683.38]  So that just gives you a sense
[2683.38 --> 2685.18]  Of the growing diversity
[2685.18 --> 2686.12]  Of our denomination
[2686.12 --> 2687.18]  Through church planting
[2687.18 --> 2688.08]  And it's just a joy
[2688.08 --> 2688.72]  To be able to serve
[2688.72 --> 2689.46]  In that capacity
[2689.46 --> 2691.46]  And we do that in North America
[2691.46 --> 2692.60]  We do that across the globe
[2692.60 --> 2693.62]  We had a speaker
[2693.62 --> 2695.22]  Come from Nepal
[2695.22 --> 2696.96]  Where there's a massive
[2696.96 --> 2698.36]  Work of God's spirit
[2698.36 --> 2699.94]  A church planting movement
[2699.94 --> 2701.52]  That's spreading like wildfire
[2701.52 --> 2702.66]  Throughout that country
[2702.66 --> 2703.40]  And we're privileged
[2703.40 --> 2704.46]  To be part of that
[2704.46 --> 2706.12]  So on behalf of Resonate
[2706.12 --> 2707.06]  I just want to thank you
[2707.06 --> 2708.78]  For your faithful giving
[2708.78 --> 2710.26]  To Resonate Global Mission
[2710.26 --> 2712.22]  You make that work possible
[2712.22 --> 2713.02]  So thank you
[2713.02 --> 2716.90]  But I'm more here
[2716.90 --> 2718.02]  To talk about God's word
[2718.02 --> 2719.04]  Which is a joy
[2719.04 --> 2719.62]  And a privilege
[2719.62 --> 2720.46]  For me to do
[2720.46 --> 2722.88]  I just want to
[2722.88 --> 2724.32]  Begin
[2724.32 --> 2725.78]  With
[2725.78 --> 2726.76]  A couple words
[2726.76 --> 2727.26]  And then I'll read
[2727.26 --> 2727.86]  The passage
[2727.86 --> 2730.34]  And this is
[2730.34 --> 2732.00]  What I want to talk about
[2732.00 --> 2732.64]  This morning
[2732.64 --> 2733.80]  Is something that
[2733.80 --> 2735.64]  In my own Christian journey
[2735.64 --> 2737.72]  It took a while
[2737.72 --> 2738.62]  For this reality
[2738.62 --> 2739.38]  To sink in
[2739.38 --> 2741.38]  And here's what
[2741.38 --> 2742.22]  I want to talk about
[2742.22 --> 2744.68]  God's grace
[2744.68 --> 2746.52]  Offends
[2746.52 --> 2748.50]  It's offensive
[2748.50 --> 2750.90]  In fact I would say
[2750.90 --> 2752.86]  That if you've never felt
[2752.86 --> 2754.80]  The offensiveness
[2754.80 --> 2756.72]  Of God's grace
[2756.72 --> 2759.00]  It's possible
[2759.00 --> 2759.82]  That like
[2759.82 --> 2760.54]  Like I did
[2760.54 --> 2761.32]  For many years
[2761.32 --> 2762.14]  It's possible
[2762.14 --> 2763.00]  That the reality
[2763.00 --> 2763.90]  Of God's grace
[2763.90 --> 2765.16]  Has not completely
[2765.16 --> 2765.94]  Sunk deep
[2765.94 --> 2766.70]  Into your heart
[2766.70 --> 2768.52]  If at some point
[2768.52 --> 2770.00]  It hasn't offended you
[2770.00 --> 2772.28]  And yet
[2772.28 --> 2772.96]  While the notion
[2772.96 --> 2774.00]  That God's grace
[2774.00 --> 2774.92]  Offends
[2774.92 --> 2776.78]  Might sound
[2776.78 --> 2777.60]  A bit jarring
[2777.60 --> 2779.46]  And certainly
[2779.46 --> 2780.08]  It's a jarring
[2780.08 --> 2780.98]  Way to start
[2780.98 --> 2781.56]  A message
[2781.56 --> 2783.72]  For those
[2783.72 --> 2784.42]  Who've experienced
[2784.42 --> 2785.24]  God's grace
[2785.24 --> 2787.38]  It's offensiveness
[2787.38 --> 2788.46]  Is
[2788.46 --> 2789.72]  Profoundly
[2789.72 --> 2790.54]  Good news
[2790.54 --> 2791.74]  And I hope you
[2791.74 --> 2792.14]  Catch that
[2792.14 --> 2792.70]  This morning
[2792.70 --> 2793.88]  Let me read
[2793.88 --> 2794.54]  Our story
[2794.54 --> 2795.54]  And then we'll
[2795.54 --> 2796.34]  Reflect together
[2796.34 --> 2797.78]  On what God
[2797.78 --> 2798.32]  Might be wanting
[2798.32 --> 2799.06]  To say to us
[2799.06 --> 2799.68]  Through his word
[2799.68 --> 2801.56]  I'm reading
[2801.56 --> 2802.68]  From 2 Kings
[2802.68 --> 2804.16]  Chapter 5
[2804.16 --> 2805.20]  And I'm going
[2805.20 --> 2805.76]  To read
[2805.76 --> 2806.94]  Verse
[2806.94 --> 2807.70]  All the way
[2807.70 --> 2808.70]  Down to verse 19
[2808.70 --> 2814.36]  Now Naaman
[2814.36 --> 2816.14]  Was commander
[2816.14 --> 2816.94]  Of the army
[2816.94 --> 2817.58]  Of the king
[2817.58 --> 2818.08]  Of Aram
[2818.08 --> 2820.40]  He was a great
[2820.40 --> 2821.08]  Man in the
[2821.08 --> 2821.58]  Side of his
[2821.58 --> 2822.04]  Master
[2822.04 --> 2823.52]  And highly
[2823.52 --> 2824.18]  Regarded
[2824.18 --> 2825.78]  Because through
[2825.78 --> 2826.38]  Him the Lord
[2826.38 --> 2827.18]  Had given victory
[2827.18 --> 2827.78]  To Aram
[2827.78 --> 2829.92]  He was a valiant
[2829.92 --> 2830.36]  Soldier
[2830.36 --> 2833.04]  But he had
[2833.04 --> 2833.62]  Leprosy
[2833.62 --> 2835.98]  Now bands
[2835.98 --> 2836.56]  Of raiders
[2836.56 --> 2837.26]  From Aram
[2837.26 --> 2838.46]  Had gone out
[2838.46 --> 2839.50]  And had taken
[2839.50 --> 2840.34]  Captive a young
[2840.34 --> 2841.24]  Girl from Israel
[2841.24 --> 2843.22]  And she served
[2843.22 --> 2843.96]  Naaman's wife
[2843.96 --> 2846.06]  She said to
[2846.06 --> 2846.82]  Her mistress
[2846.82 --> 2848.56]  If only my
[2848.56 --> 2849.58]  Master would see
[2849.58 --> 2850.28]  The prophet
[2850.28 --> 2850.84]  Who was in
[2850.84 --> 2851.30]  Samaria
[2851.30 --> 2853.06]  He would cure
[2853.06 --> 2853.64]  Him of his
[2853.64 --> 2854.16]  Leprosy
[2854.16 --> 2856.48]  So Naaman
[2856.48 --> 2857.12]  Went to his
[2857.12 --> 2857.50]  Master
[2857.50 --> 2858.64]  And told him
[2858.64 --> 2859.10]  What the girl
[2859.10 --> 2859.64]  From Israel
[2859.64 --> 2860.26]  Had said
[2860.26 --> 2862.10]  By all means
[2862.10 --> 2862.48]  Go
[2862.48 --> 2862.88]  The king
[2862.88 --> 2863.32]  Of Aram
[2863.32 --> 2863.82]  Replied
[2863.82 --> 2865.14]  I will send
[2865.14 --> 2865.56]  A letter
[2865.56 --> 2866.28]  To the king
[2866.28 --> 2866.90]  Of Israel
[2866.90 --> 2868.98]  So Naaman
[2868.98 --> 2869.46]  Left
[2869.46 --> 2870.64]  Taking with
[2870.64 --> 2871.10]  Him ten
[2871.10 --> 2871.54]  Talents
[2871.54 --> 2872.06]  Of silver
[2872.06 --> 2874.10]  Six thousand
[2874.10 --> 2874.70]  Shekels
[2874.70 --> 2875.18]  Of gold
[2875.18 --> 2875.76]  And ten
[2875.76 --> 2876.16]  Sets
[2876.16 --> 2876.76]  Of clothing
[2876.76 --> 2878.78]  The letter
[2878.78 --> 2879.36]  That he took
[2879.36 --> 2879.82]  To the king
[2879.82 --> 2880.26]  Of Israel
[2880.26 --> 2880.68]  Read
[2880.68 --> 2882.02]  With this
[2882.02 --> 2882.36]  Letter
[2882.36 --> 2882.94]  I am sending
[2882.94 --> 2883.48]  My servant
[2883.48 --> 2883.90]  Naaman
[2883.90 --> 2884.32]  To you
[2884.32 --> 2884.68]  So that you
[2884.68 --> 2885.14]  May cure
[2885.14 --> 2885.34]  Him
[2885.34 --> 2885.66]  Of his
[2885.66 --> 2886.18]  Leprosy
[2886.18 --> 2888.88]  And as soon
[2888.88 --> 2889.36]  As the king
[2889.36 --> 2889.80]  Of Israel
[2889.80 --> 2890.34]  Read the
[2890.34 --> 2890.60]  Letter
[2890.60 --> 2892.24]  He tore
[2892.24 --> 2892.98]  His robes
[2892.98 --> 2893.40]  And said
[2893.40 --> 2893.98]  Am I
[2893.98 --> 2894.50]  God
[2894.50 --> 2896.22]  Can I
[2896.22 --> 2896.54]  Kill
[2896.54 --> 2896.98]  And bring
[2896.98 --> 2897.50]  Back to
[2897.50 --> 2897.86]  Life
[2897.86 --> 2899.80]  Why does
[2899.80 --> 2900.40]  This fellow
[2900.40 --> 2901.08]  Send someone
[2901.08 --> 2901.40]  To me
[2901.40 --> 2901.90]  To be cured
[2901.90 --> 2902.18]  Of his
[2902.18 --> 2902.74]  Leprosy
[2902.74 --> 2904.32]  See
[2904.32 --> 2904.94]  How he
[2904.94 --> 2905.24]  Is trying
[2905.24 --> 2905.52]  To pick
[2905.52 --> 2906.00]  A quarrel
[2906.00 --> 2906.40]  With me
[2906.40 --> 2908.72]  When
[2908.72 --> 2909.18]  Elisha
[2909.18 --> 2909.52]  The man
[2909.52 --> 2909.98]  Of god
[2909.98 --> 2910.36]  Heard
[2910.36 --> 2910.68]  That the
[2910.68 --> 2910.84]  King
[2910.84 --> 2910.98]  Of
[2910.98 --> 2911.32]  Israel
[2911.32 --> 2911.74]  Had torn
[2911.74 --> 2912.48]  His robes
[2912.48 --> 2914.28]  He sent
[2914.28 --> 2914.62]  Him this
[2914.62 --> 2915.10]  Message
[2915.10 --> 2916.72]  Why have
[2916.72 --> 2917.12]  You torn
[2917.12 --> 2917.88]  Your robes
[2917.88 --> 2918.78]  Have the
[2918.78 --> 2919.22]  Man come
[2919.22 --> 2919.50]  To me
[2919.50 --> 2919.74]  And he
[2919.74 --> 2920.14]  Will know
[2920.14 --> 2920.52]  That there
[2920.52 --> 2920.86]  Is a
[2920.86 --> 2921.18]  Prophet
[2921.18 --> 2921.42]  In
[2921.42 --> 2921.86]  Israel
[2921.86 --> 2923.62]  So
[2923.62 --> 2924.26]  Naaman
[2924.26 --> 2924.76]  Went with
[2924.76 --> 2925.24]  His horses
[2925.24 --> 2925.98]  And chariots
[2925.98 --> 2926.54]  And stopped
[2926.54 --> 2927.14]  At the door
[2927.14 --> 2927.88]  Of Elisha's
[2927.88 --> 2928.28]  House
[2928.28 --> 2930.50]  Elisha
[2930.50 --> 2930.98]  Sent a
[2930.98 --> 2931.34]  Messenger
[2931.34 --> 2931.90]  To say
[2931.90 --> 2932.30]  To him
[2932.30 --> 2934.26]  Go wash
[2934.26 --> 2934.70]  Yourself
[2934.70 --> 2935.50]  Seven times
[2935.50 --> 2936.04]  In the Jordan
[2936.04 --> 2937.36]  And your
[2937.36 --> 2937.68]  Flesh
[2937.68 --> 2937.96]  Will be
[2937.96 --> 2938.58]  Restored
[2938.58 --> 2940.06]  And you
[2940.06 --> 2940.32]  Will be
[2940.32 --> 2941.08]  Cleansed
[2941.08 --> 2943.32]  But Naaman
[2943.32 --> 2943.92]  Went away
[2943.92 --> 2944.44]  Angry
[2944.44 --> 2946.02]  And said
[2946.02 --> 2947.44]  I thought
[2947.44 --> 2947.74]  He would
[2947.74 --> 2948.00]  Surely
[2948.00 --> 2948.44]  Come out
[2948.44 --> 2948.70]  To me
[2948.70 --> 2949.30]  And stand
[2949.30 --> 2950.22]  And call
[2950.22 --> 2950.46]  On the
[2950.46 --> 2950.66]  Name
[2950.66 --> 2950.92]  Of the
[2950.92 --> 2951.10]  Lord
[2951.10 --> 2951.64]  His God
[2951.64 --> 2951.92]  Wave
[2951.92 --> 2952.50]  His hand
[2952.50 --> 2952.92]  Over the
[2952.92 --> 2953.36]  Spot
[2953.36 --> 2954.02]  And cure
[2954.02 --> 2954.62]  Me
[2954.62 --> 2955.06]  Of my
[2955.06 --> 2955.76]  Leprosy
[2955.76 --> 2958.24]  Are not
[2958.24 --> 2959.00]  Abana
[2959.00 --> 2959.38]  And
[2959.38 --> 2962.62]  Parfar
[2962.62 --> 2963.44]  The rivers
[2963.44 --> 2964.30]  Of Damascus
[2964.30 --> 2964.94]  Better
[2964.94 --> 2965.36]  Than all
[2965.36 --> 2965.82]  The waters
[2965.82 --> 2966.40]  Of Israel
[2966.40 --> 2967.92]  Couldn't
[2967.92 --> 2968.38]  I wash
[2968.38 --> 2968.88]  In them
[2968.88 --> 2969.62]  And be
[2969.62 --> 2970.30]  Cleansed
[2970.30 --> 2971.76]  So he
[2971.76 --> 2972.36]  Turned
[2972.36 --> 2972.66]  And went
[2972.66 --> 2972.94]  Off
[2972.94 --> 2973.18]  In a
[2973.18 --> 2973.60]  Rage
[2973.60 --> 2976.28]  Naaman's
[2976.28 --> 2976.64]  Servants
[2976.64 --> 2977.02]  Went to
[2977.02 --> 2977.20]  Him
[2977.20 --> 2977.68]  And said
[2977.68 --> 2979.46]  My father
[2979.46 --> 2980.12]  If the
[2980.12 --> 2980.46]  Prophet
[2980.46 --> 2981.26]  Had told
[2981.26 --> 2981.52]  You to
[2981.52 --> 2981.92]  Do some
[2981.92 --> 2982.20]  Great
[2982.20 --> 2982.64]  Thing
[2982.64 --> 2984.56]  Would you
[2984.56 --> 2984.94]  Not have
[2984.94 --> 2985.38]  Done it
[2985.38 --> 2987.74]  How much
[2987.74 --> 2988.04]  More
[2988.04 --> 2988.36]  When he
[2988.36 --> 2988.72]  Tells
[2988.72 --> 2988.94]  You
[2988.94 --> 2989.94]  Wash
[2989.94 --> 2990.66]  And be
[2990.66 --> 2991.40]  Cleansed
[2991.40 --> 2993.58]  So he
[2993.58 --> 2994.08]  Went down
[2994.08 --> 2994.54]  And dipped
[2994.54 --> 2995.16]  Himself in
[2995.16 --> 2995.58]  The Jordan
[2995.58 --> 2996.60]  Seven times
[2996.60 --> 2997.72]  As the
[2997.72 --> 2998.04]  Man of
[2998.04 --> 2998.30]  God
[2998.30 --> 2998.74]  Had told
[2998.74 --> 2998.96]  Him
[2998.96 --> 3000.10]  And his
[3000.10 --> 3000.46]  Flesh
[3000.46 --> 3001.30]  Was restored
[3001.30 --> 3001.84]  And became
[3001.84 --> 3002.50]  Clean like
[3002.50 --> 3002.98]  That of a
[3002.98 --> 3003.48]  Young boy
[3003.48 --> 3005.70]  The Naaman
[3005.70 --> 3006.22]  And all his
[3006.22 --> 3006.72]  Attendants
[3006.72 --> 3007.62]  Went back
[3007.62 --> 3007.92]  To the
[3007.92 --> 3008.24]  Man of
[3008.24 --> 3008.56]  God
[3008.56 --> 3009.70]  He stood
[3009.70 --> 3010.30]  Before him
[3010.30 --> 3010.72]  And said
[3010.72 --> 3011.36]  Now I
[3011.36 --> 3011.90]  Know that
[3011.90 --> 3012.28]  There is
[3012.28 --> 3013.08]  No God
[3013.08 --> 3013.78]  In all
[3013.78 --> 3014.18]  The world
[3014.18 --> 3014.72]  Except in
[3014.72 --> 3015.12]  Israel
[3015.12 --> 3016.56]  So please

[3017.14 --> 3017.72]  Gift from
[3017.72 --> 3018.22]  Your servant
[3018.22 --> 3020.16]  The prophet
[3020.16 --> 3020.70]  Answered
[3020.70 --> 3021.68]  Surely as
[3021.68 --> 3022.02]  The Lord
[3022.02 --> 3022.42]  Lives
[3022.42 --> 3022.78]  Whom I
[3022.78 --> 3023.08]  Serve
[3023.08 --> 3023.24]  I

[3024.46 --> 3025.92]  And even
[3025.92 --> 3026.42]  Though Naaman
[3026.42 --> 3027.14]  Urged him
[3027.14 --> 3028.04]  He refused
[3028.04 --> 3029.94]  If you
[3029.94 --> 3030.44]  Will not
[3030.44 --> 3031.04]  Said Naaman
[3031.04 --> 3033.08]  Please let

[5309.58 --> 5310.94]  And would you please pray with me?
[5312.64 --> 5317.74]  Almighty God, to you all hearts are open and all desires are known.
[5318.46 --> 5325.38]  We come to you with hearts that are filled with desires, with longings, with hopes, with needs.
[5326.40 --> 5330.26]  And we pray that you would hear us and answer us in your time as we wait on you.
[5331.22 --> 5337.86]  Lord, hear us as we come to you with various specific needs and concerns that we have for our congregation.
[5338.98 --> 5342.88]  Father, we pray for many in our church family who need your healing grace.
[5342.88 --> 5352.40]  We pray for Pat Bauman, Richie Hendrickson, Jordan Van Toll, and Pastor Nancy in their time of recovery from surgeries.
[5353.22 --> 5356.24]  Lord, would you bring each of them to full healing and health.
[5356.24 --> 5363.66]  And as they continue to make progress in their recovery, we ask that you would give them courage to continue to look to you.
[5364.66 --> 5368.58]  We pray for Amy Cron as she continues to receive treatments.
[5369.50 --> 5373.34]  Lord, we pray for her wellness and healing.
[5373.34 --> 5378.90]  You are the great physician, Lord, and we trust in you and we look to you for healing.
[5380.48 --> 5388.74]  We pray that you would pour out your constant love and care on Eileen, Shirley, and Grace as they continue to need your healing presence in their lives.

[5405.62 --> 5410.32]  And Lord, finally, we pray for our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church,
[5410.38 --> 5417.90]  as delegates from all over Canada and the U.S. are gathered for synod in Grand Rapids this week.
[5418.74 --> 5422.96]  And as their theme this year is longing to be like Christ,
[5423.60 --> 5430.62]  we pray for all of the delegates gathered, that they would have the same attitude as our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5431.18 --> 5439.02]  We pray that they would be united with Christ, that they would have comfort from his love and fellowship with the Spirit.
[5439.96 --> 5444.98]  We pray that by your Spirit that they would have tenderness and compassion for one another,
[5444.98 --> 5449.04]  that they would be like-minded, having the same love and purpose.
[5450.12 --> 5454.02]  We pray that they would do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit,
[5454.48 --> 5459.48]  but in humility look to the interests of others, taking the very nature of a servant.
[5460.66 --> 5465.60]  And guide them, O Lord, in all of their deliberations and decisions by your love and truth,
[5466.24 --> 5470.44]  revealed to us most beautifully in the person of Jesus our Lord.
[5470.44 --> 5473.62]  Lord, you are the King of our hearts.
[5474.58 --> 5480.12]  We ask for your will to be done on earth as it is in heaven and all of these places.
[5481.06 --> 5485.82]  And we look to you as we lay all of these prayers down at your feet.
[5486.58 --> 5489.60]  We pray these things in your Son's precious and holy name.
[5490.42 --> 5490.74]  Amen.
[5490.74 --> 5493.56]  So friends, let's all stand.
[5494.32 --> 5498.08]  And we go out today with God's blessing upon us.
[5498.66 --> 5502.12]  And after the benediction and we sing our final song,
[5502.20 --> 5505.22]  I invite you to join us for a time of fellowship right through the doors
[5505.22 --> 5510.40]  and into the fellowship hall to enjoy coffee and to spend time with each other.
[5511.14 --> 5514.24]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's grace.
[5514.24 --> 5518.82]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God,
[5519.24 --> 5523.52]  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with each of you now and forever.
