[311.30 --> 313.30]  Oh, there we are.
[313.30 --> 321.30]  Well, as Perry reminded me on the way in that the number of options for seat selection are more than usual this morning.
[321.30 --> 327.30]  But it's that time of the summer when many people are off on holidays.
[327.30 --> 329.30]  A few or more are gathered.
[329.30 --> 331.30]  The Lord is here.
[331.30 --> 333.30]  Welcome to you all.
[333.30 --> 340.30]  Pastor Jason Truel will continue this series of sermons on Acts, Living God's Mission.
[340.30 --> 342.30]  The sermon title this morning is We Little Gods.
[342.30 --> 344.30]  I'm curious to know what that is.
[344.30 --> 346.30]  I hope you are too.
[346.30 --> 350.30]  Pastor Jason will be on vacation beginning, really, tomorrow.
[350.30 --> 354.30]  So we welcome his time of getting away and getting some rest.
[354.30 --> 362.30]  But if you have any pastoral concerns, you'll have to contact one of the elders for the next several weeks up until August 25.
[362.30 --> 368.30]  This morning we have an exciting time of both membership and baptisms.
[368.30 --> 371.30]  I see one of the customers down here already.
[371.30 --> 374.30]  And I'm looking forward to that.
[374.30 --> 380.30]  The bulletin today contains the new bookmarks for Bible readings for the month of August.
[380.30 --> 382.30]  So take a note of that.
[382.30 --> 386.30]  Today's offering is for the Chaplain and Refugee Support Mobilizer.
[386.30 --> 388.30]  This is a local ministry.
[388.30 --> 391.30]  It's a ministry that operates out of First CRC in Vancouver.
[391.30 --> 396.30]  It provides a presence and neighborhood welcome for refugees.
[396.30 --> 402.30]  It supports integration into communities and mobilizes local congregations to help with support.
[402.30 --> 408.30]  Our call to worship this morning will be on the screen.
[408.30 --> 409.30]  And it's a responsive reading.
[409.30 --> 412.30]  And you know when to read when you see the double arrows.
[412.30 --> 418.30]  Early in the morning we gather at the edge of heaven,
[418.30 --> 424.30]  finding the gates flung open wide by the one who welcomes all.
[424.30 --> 429.30]  Early in the morning we come to this place of worship.
[429.30 --> 434.30]  To be touched by the one who offers us grace and love.
[434.30 --> 439.30]  Early in the morning we worship God who adopts us into the family.
[439.30 --> 446.30]  To be filled by the one who would pour us out in service to the world.
[446.30 --> 452.30]  Will you join with me as we have an opening prayer of adoration.
[452.30 --> 457.30]  We ask for God's presence with us this morning.
[457.30 --> 461.30]  Blessed are you Lord God, King of this earth and the universe.
[461.30 --> 465.30]  In your majesty and power you reign forever.
[465.30 --> 469.30]  You have made all creation and made that known to us so that we can honor you.
[469.30 --> 474.30]  And we do that joining with Christians worldwide today.
[474.30 --> 477.30]  As we prepare for worship we pray that you will quiet our hearts.
[477.30 --> 480.30]  That we may hear your voice in your word.
[480.30 --> 483.30]  And in the words of your servant Pastor Jason.
[483.30 --> 486.30]  Help us to take an honest look at ourselves.
[486.30 --> 490.30]  Shine a light on the places of our hearts that need repentance.
[490.30 --> 495.30]  For those who feel lost remind them that you are the way.
[495.30 --> 497.30]  Guide them to truth.
[497.30 --> 502.30]  We pray that you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer you.
[502.30 --> 507.30]  May our worship today be another step in offering our lives to you.
[507.30 --> 510.30]  We pray this in the name of Jesus.
[510.30 --> 511.30]  The Christ.
[511.30 --> 515.30]  With the Father and the Spirit is the only true God.
[515.30 --> 516.30]  Amen.
[516.30 --> 522.30]  The Lord's greeting comes to us as an adaptation from Jude.
[522.30 --> 526.30]  God the Father has loved you and Jesus Christ has kept you safe.
[526.30 --> 530.30]  May mercy peace and love be yours in abundance.
[530.30 --> 537.30]  Please stand if you are able and greet one another this morning.
[537.30 --> 540.30]  The Lord Lord, the Lord has loved you serving for 3 days.
[540.30 --> 544.30]  For the加油 all the place and that Bruno thevrerafo wa tuesday.

[858.30 --> 859.30]  Amen.
[859.30 --> 865.30]  So it is always a great joy to welcome new members into a congregation.
[865.30 --> 872.30]  And today we are welcoming into membership Emanuel and Asifoway, Vahid and Benez and Kenny.
[872.30 --> 875.30]  Many of you know them pretty well.
[875.30 --> 878.30]  But before they come up, let me just give a brief introduction.
[878.30 --> 886.30]  And so a common question people will ask is what's the point of formal membership, right?
[886.30 --> 895.30]  Isn't it just enough for us to profess our faith in Christ, you know, without kind of officially joining a church?
[895.30 --> 898.30]  And, you know, that's a fair question.
[898.30 --> 904.30]  On the one hand, it is true that we are all members of Christ's body, right?
[904.30 --> 916.30]  And so as part of the universal church of all believers, you know, around the world throughout all times, you know, in heaven and on earth, we are part of Christ's body.
[916.30 --> 918.30]  We are members of one another.
[918.30 --> 930.30]  But at the same time, you know, as we look at the New Testament, the New Testament indicates that when someone became a Christian, that they would become part of a local church, right?
[930.30 --> 937.30]  And we see that all in Paul's letters, you'd write to the church in Corinth or the church in Ephesus.
[937.30 --> 939.30]  And he would name names.
[939.30 --> 941.30]  He would know what's going on in people's lives.
[941.30 --> 945.30]  And that's why, you know, that's why church membership is so important.
[945.30 --> 961.30]  What it means is that as individuals, we not only belong to the universal church, but we belong to the local church, a local expression of God's body wherever we live.
[961.30 --> 988.30]  And so I'll invite you all to come on up and take your vows and be recognized.
[988.30 --> 991.30]  And so I'll invite you all to come on up and take your vows and be recognized.
[991.30 --> 996.30]  And so I'm going to allow each of you to introduce yourselves real briefly.
[996.30 --> 1000.30]  And since you're close to me, I'll pass you the microphone.
[1000.30 --> 1004.30]  Are we on?
[1004.30 --> 1006.30]  Shalom.
[1006.30 --> 1008.30]  Hold on, hold on.
[1008.30 --> 1009.30]  Okay, try it.
[1009.30 --> 1011.30]  Shalom, everyone.
[1011.30 --> 1015.30]  Yeah, my name is Emmanuel Bouron.
[1015.30 --> 1024.30]  I'm a husband to Asifio Bouron and father to three lovely daughters.
[1024.30 --> 1031.30]  And I'm happy to be here and take this membership today.
[1031.30 --> 1033.30]  Thank you.
[1033.30 --> 1034.30]  All right.
[1034.30 --> 1043.30]  Good morning, everyone.
[1043.30 --> 1044.30]  Good morning.
[1044.30 --> 1045.30]  Good morning.
[1045.30 --> 1046.30]  Good morning.
[1046.30 --> 1047.30]  Good morning.
[1047.30 --> 1056.30]  I don't know if I'm going to say enough to justify writing something down, but I did.
[1056.30 --> 1069.30]  So for those I haven't had the pleasure of meeting, my name is Kenny McRae.
[1069.30 --> 1070.30]  I was born in a small town in eastern Ontario called Van Cleek Hill.
[1070.30 --> 1075.30]  There with my family, I attended Knox Presbyterian Church.
[1075.30 --> 1080.30]  I was baptized as an infant there and later in my teenage years became a member.
[1080.30 --> 1081.30]  My parents remain active members there.
[1081.30 --> 1085.30]  My dad is a worship leader and my mom as an elder.
[1085.30 --> 1091.04]  I have attended Ladner CRC since I moved to Delta last May and I'd like to thank you all
[1091.04 --> 1094.30]  for being so welcoming and welcoming to me and to my dad.
[1094.30 --> 1096.30]  I was very proud of my partner in the past.
[1096.30 --> 1100.30]  This is my honor to be with you and I am the pleasure of meeting, my name is Kenny McRae.
[1100.30 --> 1107.56]  and my mom as an elder. I have attended Ladner CRC since I moved to Delta last May and I'd like
[1107.56 --> 1114.42]  to thank you all for being so welcoming to me. To me joining a church is more than simply joining
[1114.42 --> 1120.70]  the congregation but joining a family and I look forward to officially joining yours and becoming
[1120.70 --> 1140.04]  a very active member here at Ladner CRC. Thank you. Great, thank you all and I'll say that I was talking with Vahid the other day and he said he was just reading in Acts chapter 2 and he said it's like Pentecost.
[1140.04 --> 1151.42]  You know and we have you know the spirit is working and we you know and we look forward to the spirit just drawing more people from all the nations into our church family.
[1152.42 --> 1169.00]  And so friends in your baptism as we said you became members of Christ Church but today we are just so joyful that you to welcome you to become members also of this local church.
[1169.00 --> 1188.54]  And we believe that the Holy Spirit has led you here. Sometimes God's leading is mysterious so we don't know what how he will lead but he has led you here and we believe that God is sovereign and that he has a purpose for you, for us, for your good, for our good, and for his glory.
[1188.54 --> 1201.76]  And so we invite you now to affirm your faith to profess your faith in Christ and as you join the mission that God has given all of us together.
[1202.08 --> 1203.70]  So we'll have a few vows.
[1203.70 --> 1214.96]  So I will read each of the all the vows and then I'm going to give you the microphone again and I'll invite you to say you know I do God helping me.
[1215.70 --> 1217.38]  And so that'll be kind of personal for each one of you.
[1217.84 --> 1218.08]  Okay.
[1218.22 --> 1219.24]  I do God helping me.
[1219.52 --> 1220.74]  So let's hear the vows.
[1220.74 --> 1226.78]  Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[1227.30 --> 1230.66]  Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1231.36 --> 1235.08]  And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1236.08 --> 1240.82]  Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing Christ and his redemption?
[1241.38 --> 1245.10]  And that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[1245.10 --> 1256.26]  Do you promise to join with us sharing your gifts in our worship and fellowship and in the mission God has given to given us in the world?
[1258.28 --> 1259.82]  So turn this back on.
[1261.82 --> 1262.64]  I do.
[1262.96 --> 1263.92]  God help me.
[1267.38 --> 1268.50]  God help me.
[1269.88 --> 1270.72]  I do.
[1270.72 --> 1270.78]  I do.
[1270.78 --> 1277.10]  God help me.
[1278.68 --> 1279.62]  Yes, I do.
[1279.90 --> 1280.58]  God help me.
[1281.64 --> 1285.24]  So congregation, may I ask you to please stand?
[1286.12 --> 1287.82]  Rise, a body and spirit as you are able.
[1288.36 --> 1290.24]  And would you also take this vow?
[1290.54 --> 1293.40]  Do you promise to receive these brothers and sisters in love?
[1293.94 --> 1296.44]  Support them with your fellowship and prayers.
[1296.44 --> 1302.18]  And recognizing their gifts, invite them into the life and mission of our congregation.
[1303.26 --> 1303.84]  Thank you.
[1305.88 --> 1306.44]  You may be seated.
[1309.44 --> 1311.40]  So, let me pray for you.
[1311.76 --> 1311.90]  Okay?
[1312.00 --> 1312.66]  Let's pray together.
[1314.22 --> 1320.74]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have poured out your Holy Spirit upon us, the church.
[1320.74 --> 1325.62]  And that the spirit is alive and active in the world.
[1326.76 --> 1329.72]  Alive and active in the lives of individuals.
[1329.90 --> 1332.44]  Like calling us to Christ.
[1332.56 --> 1335.04]  Calling us to become part of the body of Christ.
[1335.66 --> 1341.04]  And we thank you, Lord, that wherever we go in the world, that we are united with one another as fellow believers.
[1341.04 --> 1347.02]  But we also thank you, Lord, that you have united us together as Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[1347.70 --> 1352.96]  And, Lord, you have called each one of us to be here for this time, to be part of this body.
[1353.62 --> 1362.32]  And, Lord, would you enable us to follow you as a congregation to be your witnesses in this place where you have put us.
[1362.46 --> 1363.28]  Lord, for your glory.
[1363.28 --> 1366.36]  Lord, would you bless each one of these brothers and sisters.
[1367.16 --> 1370.66]  Lord, that they would experience you in a deep way.
[1371.58 --> 1376.88]  Experience the fellowship and the joy of the Christian life as they become part of this congregation.
[1377.40 --> 1378.84]  Lord, we thank you in Jesus' name.
[1379.32 --> 1379.60]  Amen.
[1380.74 --> 1383.24]  If you hold on, I have a little gift for you.
[1388.92 --> 1389.88]  One per family.
[1391.14 --> 1391.90]  There you go.
[1391.90 --> 1397.34]  So, this is Seeking God's Face, which is a great little devotional that you can use.
[1397.88 --> 1397.96]  Okay.
[1398.48 --> 1398.88]  All right.
[1398.94 --> 1400.54]  Let's welcome them together.
[1406.98 --> 1407.40]  All right.
[1407.42 --> 1408.64]  We're not done with the Byrne family.
[1410.50 --> 1410.94]  All right.
[1411.00 --> 1412.14]  You all are very patient.
[1412.24 --> 1412.72]  You're doing great.
[1413.44 --> 1414.40]  Actually, would you hold that for me?
[1415.10 --> 1415.50]  Thank you.
[1416.14 --> 1416.32]  Okay.
[1416.32 --> 1422.02]  Not only do we ask, why do we have local church membership?
[1422.02 --> 1429.32]  Another question that people often ask is, you know, in the Christian Reformed Church, why do we baptize children?
[1430.24 --> 1431.36]  Why do we baptize children?
[1431.88 --> 1439.58]  Well, the first thing we will say is, it's not because we believe that in baptizing them, that they are automatically saved.
[1439.58 --> 1440.46]  We don't believe that.
[1441.50 --> 1449.08]  But rather, we believe that we are to baptize our children because this is what the Bible instructs us.
[1449.08 --> 1457.44]  So, Genesis chapter 17, way back in the beginning, God calls Abraham into a relationship with him.
[1457.48 --> 1458.24]  And he says this,
[1458.24 --> 1473.34]  I will establish my covenant with you, between me and you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
[1473.34 --> 1478.92]  And so, God made a covenant relationship with Abraham and with all of his offspring.
[1479.88 --> 1483.62]  And circumcision was given as the sign of this covenant relationship with God.
[1483.68 --> 1486.84]  And it was applied not just to Abraham, but to his children.
[1487.84 --> 1492.10]  Now, many centuries later, the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost.
[1492.84 --> 1495.58]  And in Acts chapter 2, Peter says this,
[1495.58 --> 1511.50]  And so, we believe that just as children in the Old Testament times received the sign of the covenant,
[1512.20 --> 1518.46]  so now, too, in the New Testament times and today, they continue to receive the sign of the covenant.
[1518.76 --> 1521.00]  And it's not a sign of our own faith in God.
[1521.00 --> 1525.38]  It's not like, I believe, and so, as a sign of my belief, I'm going to be baptized.
[1526.14 --> 1528.34]  No, it's a sign of God's grace.
[1528.78 --> 1531.70]  It's a sign that God always initiates in our lives.
[1533.28 --> 1539.80]  And so, imagine, in a safe way, having heard of God's gracious promises to us in Christ,
[1540.38 --> 1546.00]  do you desire for your three precious daughters to be baptized today?
[1547.34 --> 1547.82]  Okay.
[1547.82 --> 1552.00]  And so, I have two more vows for you.
[1553.18 --> 1555.68]  And then another vow for the congregation.
[1556.54 --> 1559.82]  So, for each one, if you agree, just say, we do.
[1560.66 --> 1560.88]  Okay.
[1561.60 --> 1565.12]  Do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature,
[1565.42 --> 1568.36]  are received by God in Christ as members of his covenant,
[1568.74 --> 1569.92]  and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1569.92 --> 1571.76]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[1572.64 --> 1575.14]  And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit,
[1575.32 --> 1576.86]  with the help of this Christian community,
[1577.50 --> 1581.68]  to do all in your power to instruct these children in the Christian faith,
[1582.12 --> 1585.40]  to lead them, by your example, into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1587.28 --> 1588.10]  It's not easy.
[1588.10 --> 1590.26]  You're doing a great job.
[1591.88 --> 1596.02]  Congregation, one more time, can I ask you all to stand again, if you are able?
[1597.24 --> 1600.84]  And do you promise to love, encourage, and support Emmanuel and the Sifah way,
[1601.24 --> 1603.22]  by teaching the gospel of God's love,
[1603.72 --> 1606.48]  by being an example of Christian faith and character,
[1607.06 --> 1609.44]  and by giving the strong support of God's family,
[1609.68 --> 1611.30]  in fellowship, prayer, and service?
[1611.30 --> 1611.42]  Yes.
[1612.02 --> 1612.82]  We do.
[1613.06 --> 1614.22]  By helping us.
[1615.26 --> 1615.66]  See?
[1615.78 --> 1616.28]  They promised.
[1616.56 --> 1617.22]  They're going to help you.
[1617.48 --> 1617.72]  Okay.
[1618.50 --> 1619.12]  You may be seated.
[1620.28 --> 1622.18]  You know, we take these vows, you know,
[1622.22 --> 1624.06]  and it's kind of formal, we just say them,
[1624.18 --> 1627.08]  but, you know, when we really think about what we're saying,
[1627.60 --> 1628.74]  you know, it's a big deal.
[1629.04 --> 1630.88]  It's a promise to raise our children,
[1631.08 --> 1632.34]  to help one another do that.
[1633.18 --> 1637.72]  And so, I'm so glad for all of the Sunday school teacher help
[1637.72 --> 1638.90]  that's going to be flooding in.
[1639.36 --> 1640.08]  I'm just kidding.
[1640.08 --> 1645.36]  So, anyway, let's go ahead and do the baptism now.
[1646.34 --> 1647.06]  You're ready.
[1647.86 --> 1648.76]  I can tell.
[1649.30 --> 1649.50]  Okay.
[1650.50 --> 1653.12]  Jack, I think I saw a pillow next to you.
[1653.24 --> 1653.44]  Would you?
[1654.98 --> 1655.58]  Here we go.
[1656.32 --> 1656.68]  Thanks.
[1658.96 --> 1663.08]  See, a Sifah way and Emmanuel from a Pentecostal background,
[1663.18 --> 1664.24]  where things are a little bit more active.
[1665.02 --> 1666.24]  See, we throw pillows.
[1667.02 --> 1667.14]  See?
[1667.74 --> 1667.96]  Okay.
[1668.24 --> 1668.38]  Yeah.
[1670.08 --> 1673.56]  Okay.
[1674.56 --> 1676.98]  Are you ladies going to be ready?
[1677.68 --> 1678.82]  Oldest first, right?
[1679.30 --> 1679.76]  Yes.
[1680.10 --> 1680.62]  Okay.
[1680.62 --> 1680.70]  Okay.
[1685.04 --> 1686.84]  So, what is the name of your child?
[1688.14 --> 1688.62]  Anel.
[1688.88 --> 1689.48]  Anel.
[1690.02 --> 1690.54]  Okay.
[1690.72 --> 1691.16]  Anel.
[1691.16 --> 1691.64]  Anel.
[1691.64 --> 1691.76]  Anel.
[1692.44 --> 1692.84]  Anel.
[1693.32 --> 1697.26]  It is for you that God created the world.
[1697.64 --> 1701.68]  It is for you that God sent Jesus to come,
[1702.18 --> 1706.58]  to live the perfect life that God wanted you to live,
[1706.78 --> 1709.10]  to suffer and die for you on the cross,
[1709.18 --> 1710.90]  to rise again for you.
[1710.90 --> 1711.90]  And he did all of you.
[1711.90 --> 1714.20]  And he did all of this for you because he loves you,
[1714.34 --> 1715.74]  to make you his child.
[1717.02 --> 1719.48]  So, I'm going to baptize you now with water.
[1719.72 --> 1719.88]  Okay.
[1721.40 --> 1724.10]  Anel, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1724.52 --> 1726.42]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1727.36 --> 1727.70]  Amen.
[1727.70 --> 1727.82]  Amen.
[1728.90 --> 1729.42]  All right.
[1730.50 --> 1731.36]  Here you go.
[1738.36 --> 1739.14]  All right.
[1739.14 --> 1739.18]  All right.
[1739.60 --> 1742.88]  And what is the name of this child?
[1753.32 --> 1754.22]  And what's your name?
[1757.70 --> 1759.86]  Janel Baran.
[1760.16 --> 1760.98]  Janel Baran.
[1761.20 --> 1761.48]  Okay.
[1761.62 --> 1761.98]  Janel.
[1762.88 --> 1763.32]  Janel.
[1765.42 --> 1766.68]  God created the world,
[1766.80 --> 1768.48]  and he created you because he loves you,
[1768.56 --> 1770.36]  and he sent Jesus to die for you,
[1770.36 --> 1773.04]  to make you his child forever.
[1774.34 --> 1776.90]  Janel, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1777.26 --> 1779.04]  and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1779.66 --> 1779.98]  Amen.
[1782.50 --> 1783.22]  Here we go.
[1786.00 --> 1786.52]  Okay.
[1787.70 --> 1788.18]  Now.
[1795.54 --> 1797.00]  And what is the name of your child?
[1797.74 --> 1798.10]  Abriel.
[1798.90 --> 1799.30]  Abriel.
[1800.58 --> 1800.94]  Abriel.
[1802.16 --> 1802.98]  You're doing great.
[1803.82 --> 1805.98]  Abriel, God created the world for you,
[1806.06 --> 1808.86]  and he sent Jesus to come and to die for you on the cross,
[1809.02 --> 1811.78]  and he rose again for you to give you new life,
[1811.78 --> 1816.52]  and he sent his spirit to come and to be with you always.
[1817.66 --> 1819.24]  So Abriel, ready?
[1819.58 --> 1819.80]  Look.
[1820.44 --> 1822.44]  I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1822.88 --> 1823.64]  and of the Son,
[1824.06 --> 1824.88]  and of the Holy Spirit.
[1825.52 --> 1825.84]  Amen.
[1825.84 --> 1826.06]  Amen.
[1829.80 --> 1832.38]  Maybe you can share a towel with you guys.
[1832.38 --> 1834.44]  All right.
[1835.88 --> 1838.18]  So let me offer this blessing for you.
[1839.34 --> 1841.78]  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[1842.18 --> 1845.26]  May the Lord turn his face toward you and be gracious to you.
[1845.60 --> 1848.94]  May the Lord lift up his face upon you and give you peace.
[1849.16 --> 1854.40]  Father, we pray that you would pour out your Holy Spirit upon this family.
[1855.18 --> 1859.58]  Lord, help Emmanuel and Sifahe to raise up these girls to know you.
[1859.98 --> 1863.42]  And Lord, would you be at work in their hearts.
[1864.12 --> 1866.44]  Lord, we cannot claim that it is from ourselves,
[1866.54 --> 1869.76]  but it is only from you in your grace that you save us,
[1870.08 --> 1871.20]  that you call us to yourself.
[1871.20 --> 1874.00]  And so would you do that work in these girls
[1874.00 --> 1877.10]  as they grow to know and love and follow you.
[1877.62 --> 1878.72]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1878.94 --> 1879.18]  Amen.
[1880.44 --> 1880.80]  All right.
[1880.80 --> 1891.16]  And I have a present for you.
[1891.38 --> 1894.16]  So this one is for you two girls to look at together
[1894.16 --> 1895.00]  because it's really big.
[1895.32 --> 1896.58]  This is a really good book.
[1896.64 --> 1897.22]  I love it.
[1897.48 --> 1898.88]  And then this one is for you.
[1899.68 --> 1900.46]  Thank you.
[1900.62 --> 1901.06]  You're welcome.
[1901.06 --> 1902.78]  All right.
[1908.22 --> 1908.66]  Okay.
[1908.66 --> 1911.68]  So let's stand and let's sing a few more songs of praise together.
[1911.68 --> 1941.66]  piano plays softly
[1941.68 --> 1971.66]  piano plays softly
[1971.68 --> 1974.68]  Great is thy faithless
[1975.36 --> 1977.68]  Morning by morning
[1978.60 --> 1981.68]  In mercies I see
[1982.24 --> 1985.94]  All I have need
[1985.94 --> 1989.86]  In thy hand and hope I hear
[1989.86 --> 1993.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[1994.38 --> 1997.68]  God unto me
[1997.68 --> 2003.48]  Summer and winter
[2003.48 --> 2005.64]  And springtime
[2005.64 --> 2007.48]  And harvest
[2007.48 --> 2009.68]  Sun and stars
[2010.80 --> 2013.68]  And their courses above
[2013.68 --> 2017.68]  Join with all nature
[2017.68 --> 2021.68]  In manifold witness
[2021.68 --> 2025.68]  To thy great faithfulness
[2025.68 --> 2029.56]  Mercy and love
[2029.56 --> 2033.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2033.68 --> 2037.48]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2037.48 --> 2039.68]  Morning by morning
[2039.68 --> 2043.68]  New mercies I see
[2043.68 --> 2047.68]  All I have need
[2047.68 --> 2051.68]  Thy hand and hope I hear
[2051.68 --> 2055.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2055.68 --> 2059.68]  Lord unto me
[2059.68 --> 2065.68]  Lord and for sin
[2065.68 --> 2069.44]  And a peace that endure
[2069.44 --> 2073.64]  Thy whole dear presence
[2073.64 --> 2076.68]  To cheer and to guide
[2076.68 --> 2079.68]  Strength for today
[2079.68 --> 2083.68]  And bright hope for tomorrow
[2083.68 --> 2085.68]  Blessings on earth
[2085.68 --> 2087.68]  Blessings on earth
[2087.68 --> 2089.68]  With ten thousand
[2089.68 --> 2091.68]  Beside
[2091.68 --> 2095.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2095.68 --> 2098.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2098.68 --> 2100.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2100.68 --> 2102.68]  Morning by morning
[2102.68 --> 2105.68]  New mercies I see
[2105.68 --> 2109.68]  All I have need
[2109.68 --> 2112.68]  Thy hand and hope I hear
[2112.68 --> 2114.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2114.68 --> 2115.68]  Morning by morning
[2115.68 --> 2116.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2116.68 --> 2118.68]  Lord unto me
[2118.68 --> 2119.68]  Great is thy faithfulness
[2119.68 --> 2122.68]  Lord unto me
[2122.68 --> 2130.68]  That a Feld of View
[2132.68 --> 2134.62]  Thank you
[2134.62 --> 2153.92]  In our days that God has numbered,
[2153.92 --> 2158.62]  I was made to walk with Him.
[2159.12 --> 2162.92]  Yet I looked for worldly treasures
[2162.92 --> 2167.82]  and forsake the King of kings.
[2167.82 --> 2172.72]  But mine is always my Redeemer.
[2172.72 --> 2176.82]  Though I fall, His love is sure.
[2176.82 --> 2181.82]  For Christ has paid for every failing.
[2181.82 --> 2186.82]  I am His forevermore.
[2192.92 --> 2222.92] 
[2222.92 --> 2227.82]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2227.82 --> 2232.72]  For Christ completes His work in me.
[2232.72 --> 2237.62]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2237.62 --> 2242.52]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2242.52 --> 2247.42]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2247.42 --> 2252.32]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2252.32 --> 2256.32]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2256.32 --> 2261.22]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2261.22 --> 2265.22]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2265.22 --> 2266.12]  That I know my pain will not be wasted.
[2266.12 --> 2276.50]  And he has said we will deliver safely to the golden shore.
[2276.50 --> 2285.44]  And by the east to Zion City, where beside the King I walk.
[2285.84 --> 2290.14]  For there my heart has found its treasure.
[2290.70 --> 2294.38]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2294.38 --> 2298.38]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2299.38 --> 2303.38]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2324.38 --> 2327.38]  You don't need to hear me twice.
[2327.38 --> 2342.66]  In a time of confession and contemplation, I've chosen the topic living the Beatitudes in our families.
[2342.66 --> 2346.66]  I have adapted some words from Reverend Deb Koster.
[2346.66 --> 2351.66]  It was written originally for Reframe Media, one of our CRC organizations.
[2351.66 --> 2355.66]  God's kingdom is upside down compared to the values of our society.
[2355.66 --> 2360.66]  What would it look like to live the Beatitudes in our families?
[2360.66 --> 2367.66]  Read with me the Beatitudes and I will have a few words to say about each one of those.
[2367.66 --> 2374.66]  First of all, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[2374.66 --> 2377.66]  To be poor in spirit is to recognize that we need Christ.
[2377.66 --> 2383.66]  We cannot do things in our own strength but rely on our Savior to equip us for tasks that lie ahead.
[2383.66 --> 2388.66]  Does your family understand that they need spiritual nourishment?
[2388.66 --> 2394.66]  How are we structuring the day to provide for the spiritual needs of our family?
[2394.66 --> 2396.66]  How are we structuring the Lord?
[2396.66 --> 2400.66]  Blessed are those who mourn.
[2400.66 --> 2406.66]  We weep for the injustice in this world and for the pain of our sins.
[2406.66 --> 2412.66]  In God's kingdom, the Lord is close by and all the wrongs one day will be made right.
[2412.66 --> 2416.66]  We are called as God's family to demonstrate compassion,
[2416.66 --> 2419.66]  caring about the hurts that others experience.
[2419.66 --> 2424.66]  Comfort one another and in doing so you will demonstrate Christ to others.
[2424.66 --> 2430.66]  Blessed are the meek.
[2430.66 --> 2432.66]  We're getting the hang of this now.
[2432.66 --> 2440.66]  Our secular nature may value taking a strong approach but God's kingdom values humility.
[2440.66 --> 2443.66]  Being meek does not mean making yourselves a doormat.
[2443.66 --> 2448.66]  It means leading through service and living in community with gentleness.
[2448.66 --> 2453.66]  We can lead as servants.
[2453.66 --> 2458.66]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[2458.66 --> 2465.66]  Righteousness means doing the right thing, protecting the weak from injustice even when inconvenient.
[2465.66 --> 2471.66]  Blessings come from earnestly seeking the priorities of God's kingdom rather than personal gain.
[2471.66 --> 2476.66]  God satisfies us with the richness of life filled with his spirit.
[2476.66 --> 2481.66]  Blessed are the merciful.
[2481.66 --> 2485.66]  Whatever we are doing for the least of these, we do for Christ.
[2485.66 --> 2489.66]  Our families grow empathy as we extend compassion.
[2489.66 --> 2494.66]  Mercy is a challenge in our individualistic, self-centered society.
[2494.66 --> 2497.66]  In what ways can we extend mercy?
[2497.66 --> 2503.66]  Blessed are the pure in heart.
[2503.66 --> 2508.66]  God wants us to live with purity within our hearts, having an undivided loyalty to him.
[2508.66 --> 2513.66]  Our families are a place for us to model hearts that desire God alone.
[2513.66 --> 2520.66]  This means focusing on the things that matter to God and not flirt with temptations.
[2520.66 --> 2527.66]  We can only live with a pure heart when we are dwelling with God and empowered by his strength.
[2527.66 --> 2529.66]  given the truth.
[2529.66 --> 2531.66]  Blessed are the peacemakers.
[2531.66 --> 2536.66]  Set an example of peace within your home and choose to let kindness and love guide your
[2536.66 --> 2538.66]  conversations and even our disagreements.
[2538.66 --> 2544.66]  We can choose to follow the heart of God and dwell in peace with one another.
[2544.66 --> 2551.66]  Ask how we can model peace in our homes.
[2551.66 --> 2555.66]  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.
[2555.66 --> 2560.58]  When we follow God, there will be opposition to us and our beliefs.
[2560.76 --> 2567.52]  It is not easy to endure, but God assures us that his kingdom is for those who have faced persecution.
[2568.56 --> 2573.78]  God walks with us through even the most painful circumstances that we face in life.
[2574.66 --> 2577.50]  Are you trusting God to handle your challenges?
[2580.80 --> 2584.00]  Blessed are you when people insult you.
[2584.00 --> 2587.72]  When we follow Christ, we will face opposition.
[2588.10 --> 2591.46]  In God's strength, we can handle whatever challenges we face in life.
[2594.70 --> 2596.32]  Rejoice and be glad.
[2597.48 --> 2606.16]  We can still find joy in the midst of challenges because God has overcome this world and established for us an eternal home with us.
[2607.78 --> 2611.46]  Let us model the qualities of the Beatitudes in our daily lives.
[2611.46 --> 2618.32]  May God's grace and peace be active in our lives so that everyone we meet experiences Christ through us.
[2618.74 --> 2622.34]  Let us live as people who are in step with God's kingdom.
[2623.34 --> 2626.32]  In so doing, we bring glory to his name.
[2627.66 --> 2630.26]  Let's respond with a song, Good to Me.
[2630.26 --> 2634.20]  Let us pray.
[2642.20 --> 2650.24]  I cry out for your hand and mercy to lead me.
[2650.24 --> 2658.08]  I am weak and I need your heart to free me
[2658.08 --> 2665.58]  Oh Lord, my word, my strength and weakness
[2665.58 --> 2672.52]  Come rescue me, oh Lord
[2672.52 --> 2680.50]  You are my hope, your promise never fails me
[2680.50 --> 2687.64]  And my desire is to follow you forever
[2687.64 --> 2695.84]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me
[2695.84 --> 2704.44]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me
[2704.44 --> 2714.24]  I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me
[2714.24 --> 2721.84]  I am weak and I need your heart to free me
[2721.84 --> 2729.20]  Oh Lord, my word, my strength and weakness
[2729.20 --> 2736.02]  Come rescue me, oh Lord
[2736.02 --> 2743.88]  You are my hope, your promise never fails me
[2743.88 --> 2749.98]  And my desire is to follow you forever
[2749.98 --> 2759.28]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me
[2759.28 --> 2767.78]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me
[2767.78 --> 2789.06]  All right, and so the children are at this time dismissed to go to their Sunday school
[2789.06 --> 2793.34]  classes, and so we have one combined class for the summer, and age, you can see they're
[2793.34 --> 2798.78]  age three to grade one.
[2798.78 --> 2805.50]  Kenny, would you mind propping the door over there for me?
[2805.50 --> 2814.34]  Thanks.
[2814.34 --> 2821.06]  So we have been in a sermon series in the book of Acts, and the book of Acts is about the
[2821.06 --> 2827.82]  early church, how the early church was sent out by Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[2827.82 --> 2832.78]  to then take the good news of the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[2832.78 --> 2838.24]  And since it's summer, and I know not everybody is here every Sunday, I want to just begin
[2838.24 --> 2844.30]  by doing a quick survey as far as what has been going on before we look at the passage
[2844.30 --> 2845.42]  for today.
[2845.42 --> 2850.74]  So over the last few weeks, we have been focusing on what is called Paul's first missionary
[2850.74 --> 2851.98]  journey.
[2851.98 --> 2856.92]  And we find this in Acts chapters 13 and 14.
[2856.92 --> 2861.00]  And so there is a map that I want to show you.
[2861.00 --> 2868.66]  And you can see on the map that this missionary journey, which lasted two years, started in
[2868.66 --> 2876.54]  Antioch, Syria, and you can see the title starting point, Antioch and Syria, just north of Israel,
[2876.54 --> 2879.10]  along the Mediterranean coast.
[2879.10 --> 2886.44]  They leave there and they go to the island of Cyprus, where a high ranking Roman official
[2886.44 --> 2889.72]  is the first significant convert.
[2889.72 --> 2896.90]  And from there, they leave Cyprus and they make their way northwest to a prominent synagogue
[2896.90 --> 2899.38]  in Pisidia, Antioch.
[2899.38 --> 2903.66]  So at the synagogue, Paul, as a visiting rabbi, is invited to speak.
[2903.66 --> 2907.14]  So he stands and he gives his first recorded sermon.
[2907.14 --> 2917.78]  He reminds his fellow Jews of God's powerful hand in shaping their history to bring his salvation
[2917.78 --> 2923.48]  to his people, all of it culminating in Jesus, the Messiah.
[2923.48 --> 2927.64]  And Paul says two pretty surprising things.
[2927.64 --> 2933.28]  First he says that it's not by keeping the law, but it is through faith in Jesus that one
[2933.28 --> 2935.38]  is justified before God.
[2935.38 --> 2943.66]  And then second, he says that this good news is for everyone, not only the Jews, but for
[2943.66 --> 2946.60]  all peoples, the Gentiles.
[2946.60 --> 2949.88]  And so many people in the city are excited.
[2949.88 --> 2950.88]  They're joyous.
[2950.88 --> 2952.70]  They believe in Jesus.
[2952.70 --> 2956.36]  But according to God's plan, many of the Jews rebelled.
[2956.36 --> 2960.20]  They incite a mob and they drive the apostles out of town.
[2960.20 --> 2967.80]  So from there, they go to the next stop is another Jewish synagogue, this time in Iconium.
[2967.80 --> 2973.08]  And we read that at the beginning of Acts chapter 14.
[2973.08 --> 2975.42]  We haven't actually studied it together.
[2975.42 --> 2980.06]  But verse four says the people of the city were divided.
[2980.06 --> 2982.82]  Some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
[2982.82 --> 2986.14]  So there's this mixed review.
[2986.14 --> 2989.32]  So then this another mob tries to stone them.
[2989.32 --> 2993.32]  They flee to a rural town called Lystra.
[2993.32 --> 2996.90]  And that is where we're going to pick up the story today.
[2996.90 --> 2997.96]  Okay.
[2997.96 --> 3015.24]  So with that, let's prepare our hearts for the reading of God's word.
[3015.24 --> 3019.52]  So we're reading from Acts chapter 14, verse 8 through 23.
[3019.52 --> 3023.88]  And in your pew Bible, that would be on page, starting on page 822.
[3025.40 --> 3028.60]  In Lystra, there sat a man who was lame.
[3029.20 --> 3032.92]  He had been that way from birth and had never walked.
[3033.52 --> 3035.88]  He listened to Paul as he was speaking.
[3035.88 --> 3043.46]  Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed, and called out, stand on your feet.
[3044.22 --> 3047.08]  At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
[3048.36 --> 3052.76]  When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycanian language,
[3052.76 --> 3056.24]  the gods have come down to us in human form.
[3057.02 --> 3062.16]  Barnabas, they called Zeus, and Paul, they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
[3062.16 --> 3069.44]  The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates
[3069.44 --> 3073.72]  because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
[3074.68 --> 3081.30]  But when the apostles, Barnabas, and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd,
[3081.50 --> 3084.62]  shouting, friends, why are you doing this?
[3084.98 --> 3087.44]  We, too, are only human like you.
[3087.44 --> 3095.14]  We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God
[3095.14 --> 3098.94]  who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
[3099.54 --> 3102.92]  In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
[3103.60 --> 3106.38]  Yet he has not left himself without testimony.
[3107.08 --> 3112.52]  He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons.
[3112.52 --> 3117.12]  He provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.
[3118.50 --> 3124.02]  Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
[3125.08 --> 3130.16]  Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over.
[3131.06 --> 3136.00]  They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
[3136.00 --> 3141.98]  But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city.
[3142.68 --> 3145.30]  The next day, he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
[3146.22 --> 3150.30]  They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples.
[3151.16 --> 3154.94]  Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
[3155.30 --> 3159.52]  strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith.
[3160.18 --> 3164.26]  We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God, they said.
[3164.26 --> 3168.46]  Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church,
[3168.70 --> 3174.16]  and with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord in whom they had put their trust.
[3174.80 --> 3176.24]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3176.84 --> 3177.74]  Thank you, God.
[3186.54 --> 3188.00]  All right, let's pray together.
[3189.90 --> 3193.42]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[3193.42 --> 3199.62]  Lord, you give it to us out of your love for us because you want us to know you.
[3200.32 --> 3203.16]  Lord, we thank you that your word is true and trustworthy.
[3203.86 --> 3207.78]  And Lord, as we open it together this morning, would you, by your Holy Spirit,
[3209.32 --> 3215.54]  teach us what it means to know God and to follow Christ in this Christian life, in this world.
[3215.80 --> 3216.92]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3217.06 --> 3217.28]  Amen.
[3217.28 --> 3217.42]  Amen.
[3219.82 --> 3224.92]  So when my kids were little, they got involved in a photo contest.
[3225.44 --> 3226.92]  So this is kind of run through a blog.
[3227.06 --> 3227.64]  Remember those?
[3227.72 --> 3229.00]  They don't have blogs anymore too much.
[3229.08 --> 3231.86]  But back then, there were blogs, and they're like mommy blogs.
[3232.32 --> 3234.06]  And so the mommy blog had a photo contest.
[3234.58 --> 3239.42]  And the contest was your kids can kind of strike a pose as a superhero.
[3239.42 --> 3240.90]  Dress up, be a superhero.
[3241.80 --> 3243.48]  And so there was a contest.
[3243.82 --> 3245.04]  So we did this just for fun.
[3245.52 --> 3248.68]  And so here's the first photo of them.
[3249.54 --> 3253.38]  Now, just by looking at the photo, what superhero do you think they are?
[3257.46 --> 3257.94]  Yeah.
[3258.96 --> 3260.72]  Basically, no one had any idea.
[3261.40 --> 3261.88]  Okay.
[3262.62 --> 3264.36]  But pretty cool looking.
[3264.92 --> 3266.10]  So that's the first photo.
[3266.10 --> 3270.38]  Now, the next photo, we sent this in, and then this is what, you know, the person running
[3270.38 --> 3273.50]  this contest just decided to come up with a name.
[3273.66 --> 3275.50]  So, the ambiguous duo.
[3276.44 --> 3278.04]  And then the caption says the bottom.
[3278.36 --> 3279.32]  I don't know if you can read it there.
[3279.68 --> 3282.68]  Confusing adversaries with unclear powers.
[3284.44 --> 3284.60]  So.
[3285.26 --> 3287.52]  And so that's what happens when there's confusion.
[3288.44 --> 3288.56]  Right?
[3288.66 --> 3295.00]  Confusion can lead to detrimental results, like being a superhero called the ambiguous duo.
[3295.00 --> 3295.06]  So.
[3296.42 --> 3298.58]  Here's another example of confusion.
[3299.42 --> 3301.74]  I was playing JV basketball.
[3302.60 --> 3304.86]  We were playing a game against another team.
[3305.30 --> 3307.26]  We were, you know, on defense.
[3307.68 --> 3309.56]  And all of a sudden, the ball is in my hands.
[3309.78 --> 3310.42]  So what did I do?
[3311.04 --> 3312.40]  I turned around and I shot it.
[3313.08 --> 3314.70]  The good news is I made it.
[3315.12 --> 3317.98]  The bad news is I scored for the wrong team.
[3317.98 --> 3318.98]  Right?
[3319.94 --> 3322.82]  And it was one of the most embarrassing moments in my life.
[3324.20 --> 3328.04]  But confusion can lead to detrimental results.
[3329.18 --> 3332.36]  Now, those are two examples where the stakes are not very high.
[3332.88 --> 3333.02]  Right?
[3333.02 --> 3337.28]  And so the consequences of confusion aren't overly detrimental.
[3338.26 --> 3339.10]  You know, it's not a big deal.
[3339.98 --> 3344.56]  But what happens if you are confused about the most important things?
[3345.50 --> 3345.62]  Right?
[3345.62 --> 3348.56]  What happens if you're confused about the most important things of life?
[3348.92 --> 3350.22]  Like knowing God.
[3350.48 --> 3351.28]  Who is God?
[3352.02 --> 3354.64]  And like how do we live out the Christian life?
[3355.42 --> 3355.54]  Right?
[3355.54 --> 3360.80]  Confusion about those things can have eternal consequences for ourselves and for others.
[3361.88 --> 3366.64]  And in this passage we read, you know, we just read, we see Paul and Barnabas.
[3366.72 --> 3373.58]  They're on this mission to bring the clarity of the gospel where there is confusion.
[3374.04 --> 3375.28]  And that's what we see today.
[3375.40 --> 3379.62]  And so John mentioned my sermon title, We Little Gods.
[3380.40 --> 3384.30]  Yesterday, I totally kind of changed my approach to the passage.
[3384.30 --> 3386.48]  So it's no longer called We Little Gods.
[3387.16 --> 3389.82]  Although maybe if you've read it, you kind of get a sense of why I said that.
[3391.02 --> 3393.88]  But the title, I don't really care about titles too much.
[3393.96 --> 3398.04]  But for those of you who want it, From Confusion to Clarity.
[3398.68 --> 3399.80]  That's the new title of the sermon.
[3399.92 --> 3401.12]  From Confusion to Clarity.
[3401.38 --> 3402.30]  So that's what we're going to talk about.
[3402.96 --> 3405.34]  And so we're going to talk about those two points.
[3405.44 --> 3407.12]  From Confusion to Clarity about God.
[3407.72 --> 3410.72]  And then from Confusion to Clarity about the Christian life.
[3411.18 --> 3412.36]  So that's what we're going to see today.
[3412.36 --> 3415.98]  And first, From Confusion to Clarity about God.
[3416.46 --> 3420.96]  And so Luke begins his story in the city of Lystra with this dramatic event.
[3421.64 --> 3423.36]  So Paul and Barnabas, they're in Lystra.
[3424.14 --> 3426.12]  And it's more like a small town.
[3426.40 --> 3430.40]  And it is a very different kind of audience than we've seen before.
[3430.64 --> 3434.94]  It's a very different culture that we haven't seen in previous towns
[3434.94 --> 3438.30]  because the people of Lystra are Gentiles.
[3438.92 --> 3440.30]  They are not Jews at all.
[3440.30 --> 3441.64]  There is no synagogue.
[3442.64 --> 3446.78]  And the people didn't know anything about the God of the Old Testament.
[3446.90 --> 3448.20]  They didn't know the living God.
[3449.24 --> 3453.90]  In a sense, it's an audience that in many ways is much like ours today in Vancouver.
[3454.76 --> 3459.70]  So as Paul is speaking, he notices a man who was born lame.
[3460.42 --> 3461.66]  He's never walked before.
[3462.36 --> 3466.44]  And Paul sees this man and he sees that he's listening.
[3466.44 --> 3469.20]  Now, we don't know what Paul was saying at this point.
[3469.68 --> 3474.58]  Maybe he was talking about Jesus, all the miraculous healings that Jesus did.
[3475.14 --> 3475.72]  We don't know.
[3476.20 --> 3481.48]  But anyway, this man, Paul could see that he had the faith to be healed.
[3481.90 --> 3483.86]  Maybe he thought, maybe this Jesus can heal me.
[3484.82 --> 3487.84]  And so Paul says, stand up on your feet.
[3488.52 --> 3491.24]  And the man jumps up and he begins to walk.
[3491.36 --> 3491.48]  Right?
[3491.48 --> 3493.18]  A man who is lame from birth.
[3493.60 --> 3494.46]  God heals him.
[3495.08 --> 3496.48]  And this gets everyone's attention.
[3497.04 --> 3497.64]  They're like, okay.
[3498.10 --> 3498.32]  Right?
[3498.34 --> 3498.92]  This is serious.
[3499.50 --> 3501.78]  Paul uses this miraculous healing.
[3502.12 --> 3502.26]  Right?
[3502.30 --> 3506.50]  This very physical evidence to authenticate his teaching.
[3506.64 --> 3506.78]  Right?
[3506.78 --> 3509.78]  To say, this God I'm telling you about, he...
[3509.78 --> 3514.16]  That's the opposite of stand and walk.
[3522.98 --> 3523.50]  Okay.
[3524.32 --> 3528.32]  You know, there are memes about why churches have fake plants in their sanctuary.
[3529.06 --> 3529.98]  I don't know.
[3530.66 --> 3531.78]  But...
[3531.78 --> 3532.78]  So...
[3533.78 --> 3535.46]  So, okay.
[3535.58 --> 3536.82]  So, the miracle, right?
[3537.16 --> 3538.08]  Stand and walk.
[3538.08 --> 3538.12]  Look.
[3539.24 --> 3541.30]  And to these people who...
[3541.30 --> 3543.26]  You know, Paul can't go as a rabbi and say,
[3543.46 --> 3546.02]  this is what God has done in your history and Jesus.
[3546.10 --> 3547.46]  They would have no idea what he's talking about.
[3547.76 --> 3549.00]  But now there's this healing.
[3549.52 --> 3550.32]  And Paul says, look.
[3550.40 --> 3551.72]  There is a God who heals.
[3552.14 --> 3553.64]  He is the one true and living God.
[3554.66 --> 3556.04]  But in their confusion,
[3556.70 --> 3561.02]  the people misunderstand the very central purpose of the healing.
[3561.42 --> 3565.28]  Instead of recognizing that God healed this man,
[3565.88 --> 3566.86]  what do the people think?
[3566.86 --> 3570.20]  That Paul and Barnabas are gods.
[3571.04 --> 3571.28]  Right?
[3571.42 --> 3572.88]  They completely misunderstand.
[3573.44 --> 3574.40]  So, look at verse 11.
[3576.08 --> 3578.92]  When the crowd saw what Paul had done,
[3579.40 --> 3581.66]  they shouted in the Laconian language,
[3582.06 --> 3584.94]  the gods have come down to us in human form.
[3584.94 --> 3588.76]  So, the crowds, they begin,
[3588.84 --> 3590.66]  they call Barnabas Zeus,
[3591.14 --> 3593.56]  and they call Paul Hermes because he was the messenger.
[3594.38 --> 3596.50]  And if you know anything about Greek mythology, right,
[3596.54 --> 3599.00]  these are gods of the Greek pantheon.
[3599.86 --> 3602.78]  Now, why did they think this?
[3603.04 --> 3604.00]  There is a good reason.
[3604.40 --> 3604.54]  Okay?
[3604.64 --> 3605.62]  It's not random.
[3605.62 --> 3613.02]  There is a local story written by the poet Ovid in the Metamorphosis.
[3613.72 --> 3618.34]  And this poet, Ovid, had told a story, told a myth about Lystra.
[3618.34 --> 3620.98]  And the story goes like this.
[3621.68 --> 3627.90]  That one day, Zeus and Hermes decided to disguise themselves as ordinary men
[3627.90 --> 3629.98]  and come and visit Lystra.
[3630.90 --> 3632.50]  So, they come to the town,
[3632.78 --> 3635.50]  but the people of the town were not friendly.
[3636.00 --> 3639.20]  They didn't treat them with hospitality.
[3640.40 --> 3643.28]  And so, Zeus and Hermes, disguised as ordinary men,
[3643.32 --> 3644.20]  they went around the town.
[3644.56 --> 3645.40]  No one accepted them.
[3645.48 --> 3646.78]  No one gave them the time of day,
[3647.32 --> 3651.42]  except for this poor elderly couple living on the margins of the town,
[3651.78 --> 3656.26]  who shared their very meager meal and food with Zeus and Hermes.
[3656.26 --> 3659.22]  They showed them great kindness and great hospitality.
[3659.98 --> 3662.20]  So, the next day, Zeus says,
[3662.30 --> 3663.42]  let's go up on this mountain.
[3663.98 --> 3667.00]  And he took the elderly couple up to the top.
[3667.16 --> 3671.18]  And then he brought a storm that flooded the entire valley,
[3671.66 --> 3672.46]  killing everyone.
[3674.16 --> 3677.58]  Ovid said that this took place in the very valley
[3677.58 --> 3679.90]  where Paul and Barnabas were now preaching.
[3680.88 --> 3684.92]  So, Paul does this miracle in the midst of the people.
[3684.92 --> 3687.32]  They are astounded and they say,
[3687.32 --> 3690.04]  this must be Zeus and Hermes.
[3690.22 --> 3693.88]  And we better not treat them the way we did the first time
[3693.88 --> 3695.36]  or we are going to be in a heap of trouble.
[3695.68 --> 3697.98]  They're like, you know, okay, we're learning this.
[3698.68 --> 3701.48]  So, instead of rejecting Paul and Barnabas,
[3701.74 --> 3703.72]  they brought out the oxen.
[3703.92 --> 3705.36]  They brought out the garlands.
[3705.50 --> 3708.52]  They're celebrating the presence of the gods
[3708.52 --> 3710.26]  who have come down among them.
[3710.26 --> 3714.14]  And this celebration was even led by the high priest
[3714.14 --> 3716.42]  of the temple of Zeus.
[3718.02 --> 3720.78]  But once Paul and Barnabas realize what's happening,
[3721.62 --> 3722.86]  they are horrified.
[3723.28 --> 3725.54]  They tear their clothes as a sign
[3725.54 --> 3727.86]  of deep emotional turmoil and grief.
[3728.58 --> 3731.06]  And in verse 15, they say this,
[3731.38 --> 3732.90]  friends, why are you doing this?
[3733.10 --> 3735.52]  We are only human like you.
[3736.36 --> 3736.56]  Right?
[3736.56 --> 3738.40]  They say, no, friends, no, stop.
[3738.80 --> 3740.28]  We're just like you.
[3740.36 --> 3740.86]  We're just men.
[3740.94 --> 3741.90]  Five fingers, five toes.
[3742.02 --> 3742.84]  We're just like you.
[3743.86 --> 3746.36]  But at the same time, you should listen to us
[3746.36 --> 3747.82]  because we are not gods,
[3748.22 --> 3751.36]  but we represent the God of all creation.
[3752.50 --> 3754.64]  And so, in verse 15, they say this,
[3755.76 --> 3758.10]  we are bringing you good news, gospel,
[3758.78 --> 3761.04]  telling you to turn from these worthless things.
[3761.52 --> 3762.42]  It's the word for idols.
[3762.76 --> 3764.08]  Turn from these worthless idols,
[3764.08 --> 3766.40]  these false gods to the living God
[3766.40 --> 3767.92]  who made the heavens and the earth,
[3768.00 --> 3769.56]  the sea and everything in them.
[3771.20 --> 3771.32]  Right?
[3771.40 --> 3773.80]  So what is the confusion about God
[3773.80 --> 3776.06]  that Paul and Barnabas are seeking to bring clarity to?
[3777.04 --> 3781.50]  The confusion is just the sinful confusion
[3781.50 --> 3784.60]  that human beings have been plagued with
[3784.60 --> 3787.10]  ever since the fall of Adam and Eve.
[3787.92 --> 3789.42]  Paul said in Romans 1,
[3789.42 --> 3794.66]  just as sinners who have been cut off from God,
[3795.30 --> 3796.38]  Romans 1, Michaela,
[3798.36 --> 3800.12]  they, what do we do?
[3800.22 --> 3803.50]  We exchange the truth about God for a lie
[3803.50 --> 3805.72]  and worship and serve creative things
[3805.72 --> 3807.22]  rather than the creator.
[3807.80 --> 3808.06]  Right?
[3808.12 --> 3810.14]  We worship idols.
[3810.46 --> 3812.80]  We worship gods of our own making
[3812.80 --> 3814.46]  rather than the living God
[3814.46 --> 3815.70]  who made the heavens and the earth.
[3816.34 --> 3817.96]  And then Paul goes on in verse 16.
[3817.96 --> 3819.38]  He says,
[3819.56 --> 3820.36]  in the past,
[3820.52 --> 3823.54]  he let all the nations go their own way,
[3823.64 --> 3825.62]  meaning they would just kind of live out
[3825.62 --> 3826.62]  making their own gods,
[3826.84 --> 3829.28]  live out being separated from the living God.
[3830.28 --> 3831.34]  But even then,
[3831.50 --> 3831.78]  yet,
[3832.24 --> 3834.42]  he has not left himself without testimony.
[3835.10 --> 3836.28]  He has shown you kindness
[3836.28 --> 3838.34]  by giving you rain from heaven
[3838.34 --> 3839.90]  and crops in their seasons.
[3840.60 --> 3842.92]  He provides you with plenty of food,
[3843.10 --> 3844.92]  fills your hearts with gladness.
[3846.28 --> 3846.86]  With joy.
[3846.86 --> 3852.42]  Paul here is trying to bring clarity
[3852.42 --> 3853.28]  to their confusion.
[3853.60 --> 3854.88]  They don't know the living God.
[3855.82 --> 3858.66]  And so he's very carefully making a distinction
[3858.66 --> 3860.68]  between these worthless gods
[3860.68 --> 3861.84]  that they know and serve
[3861.84 --> 3863.22]  and the living God.
[3864.06 --> 3864.86]  And he says,
[3864.94 --> 3865.34]  you know what?
[3865.64 --> 3866.08]  Zeus,
[3866.74 --> 3867.26]  Hermes,
[3868.00 --> 3869.82]  they came to your town
[3869.82 --> 3871.82]  looking for kindness.
[3871.82 --> 3876.16]  They wanted you to show them hospitality.
[3876.16 --> 3878.32]  They wanted you to show them kindness.
[3879.38 --> 3880.50]  That's them.
[3880.74 --> 3882.12]  But now look at the living God.
[3882.90 --> 3885.50]  He is the one who shows you hospitality.
[3886.36 --> 3889.60]  He created this entire world as your home
[3889.60 --> 3890.72]  for you to live in.
[3891.44 --> 3892.72]  He gives you rains.
[3892.72 --> 3895.00]  He gives you this beautiful sunset.
[3895.86 --> 3897.68]  He gives you friendships and family.
[3898.34 --> 3899.94]  He gives you a slice of watermelon
[3899.94 --> 3901.82]  on a hot summer day.
[3902.18 --> 3904.34]  All of these good things of life that you enjoy,
[3904.40 --> 3907.00]  they all bear witness to the living God,
[3907.46 --> 3910.80]  to his generosity and his grace to you.
[3910.80 --> 3914.90]  And although you haven't acknowledged him,
[3915.58 --> 3917.24]  though you haven't loved him
[3917.24 --> 3920.28]  and worshipped him as he is deserving of,
[3921.04 --> 3922.88]  this God hasn't just destroyed you.
[3923.60 --> 3926.26]  Rather, this God has continued to care for you.
[3926.64 --> 3927.50]  He has been there.
[3927.76 --> 3928.90]  He has provided for you.
[3929.02 --> 3930.72]  He has satisfied your hearts
[3930.72 --> 3931.62]  with all these things.
[3933.42 --> 3935.80]  And the worthlessness of these false gods
[3935.80 --> 3938.16]  is evident in the fact that they don't do this.
[3938.54 --> 3940.04]  They can't do anything for you.
[3940.04 --> 3942.70]  They just demand that you satisfy them.
[3944.02 --> 3945.80]  And he calls them worthless, right?
[3945.82 --> 3948.28]  It's a word that means empty, vain.
[3949.42 --> 3950.50]  They're empty.
[3950.60 --> 3951.44]  They don't satisfy.
[3953.06 --> 3955.82]  So Paul hears it just very plain language
[3955.82 --> 3958.24]  telling them about the true God,
[3958.66 --> 3960.52]  the one that they can turn to.
[3962.14 --> 3964.18]  And in a sense, we could say that
[3964.18 --> 3967.96]  their longings for a God to come down,
[3968.68 --> 3969.96]  right, their longings to be
[3969.96 --> 3972.14]  on the right side of this God,
[3972.70 --> 3974.90]  to be accepted by this God,
[3974.94 --> 3976.16]  is a true longing.
[3976.46 --> 3978.46]  It's a true longing that all of us have.
[3979.40 --> 3981.64]  And friends, in Jesus, we have a God
[3981.64 --> 3984.44]  who has truly satisfied these longings.
[3985.48 --> 3985.58]  Right?
[3985.68 --> 3987.26]  Jesus has come down.
[3987.26 --> 3993.76]  God's come down to speak to us.
[3993.76 --> 3994.24]  Right?
[3994.24 --> 3997.60]  To deceive us and try to test how good we are.
[3998.16 --> 4001.06]  No, but a God who truly became one of us.
[4001.52 --> 4004.10]  Who identified with us completely.
[4004.32 --> 4005.36]  Who became one of us.
[4005.78 --> 4008.96]  Who came to reveal himself to us.
[4008.96 --> 4011.66]  And Jesus said, if you have seen me,
[4012.52 --> 4013.72]  you have seen the Father.
[4014.72 --> 4016.80]  And he's come down to speak to us.
[4017.14 --> 4019.02]  To show us what God is like.
[4019.64 --> 4019.86]  Right?
[4019.90 --> 4020.94]  Not to be vindictive.
[4021.02 --> 4023.12]  Not to destroy those who don't know him.
[4023.48 --> 4025.34]  But he came so that we can know him.
[4025.40 --> 4026.44]  We can know this God.
[4027.88 --> 4030.08]  And Jesus, you know, he doesn't come making demands.
[4030.58 --> 4032.64]  He doesn't say, you must sacrifice this
[4032.64 --> 4034.44]  in order to be on my good side.
[4035.10 --> 4037.10]  He doesn't say, you have to give this up.
[4037.62 --> 4040.36]  But Christianity, rather, it's not primarily a message
[4040.36 --> 4042.64]  about what we have to give to God.
[4043.06 --> 4044.60]  To get into God's good books.
[4045.66 --> 4047.42]  There is a sacrifice involved.
[4047.42 --> 4047.68]  Right?
[4048.26 --> 4051.42]  But the sacrifice is that Jesus gave himself for us.
[4052.24 --> 4056.54]  He's the one who came to offer the sacrifice of himself
[4056.54 --> 4059.46]  so that we can know of his love for us.
[4060.60 --> 4063.74]  And that's why worshiping other gods is so grievous to God.
[4064.44 --> 4064.80]  Right?
[4064.84 --> 4066.72]  God has just poured out his generosity and grace.
[4066.86 --> 4067.82]  He's revealed himself.
[4068.14 --> 4070.32]  He showed us who he is in Jesus Christ.
[4071.50 --> 4076.24]  And so this confusion about who God is,
[4076.26 --> 4077.86]  it leads to detrimental results.
[4079.00 --> 4081.30]  Jonah chapter 2 verse 8 says this.
[4083.40 --> 4085.72]  Those who cling to worthless idols
[4085.72 --> 4087.90]  turn away from God's love for them.
[4087.90 --> 4093.16]  So what is the response that God wants from us?
[4094.00 --> 4097.14]  He wants us simply not to sacrifice to him,
[4097.22 --> 4098.46]  not to do all these things,
[4098.76 --> 4100.34]  but simply to turn to him.
[4101.62 --> 4102.02]  Repentance.
[4102.56 --> 4104.44]  And put our faith and our trust in this God
[4104.44 --> 4106.42]  who loves us and who has made us his own.
[4107.70 --> 4108.86]  So that's just the first point.
[4110.24 --> 4111.70]  We see this, you know,
[4111.74 --> 4114.16]  from confusion about who God is to clarity.
[4114.16 --> 4117.12]  But then the second thing I want us to see here
[4117.12 --> 4119.32]  is from confusion to clarity,
[4119.32 --> 4121.00]  not only about God,
[4121.10 --> 4122.76]  but about the Christian life.
[4122.86 --> 4124.96]  What is the Christian life about?
[4125.52 --> 4128.52]  And we see that in what happens next in our passage.
[4129.62 --> 4131.04]  So Paul and Barnabas,
[4131.78 --> 4134.18]  they're going through these towns,
[4134.24 --> 4135.48]  they're going back through the towns
[4135.48 --> 4137.12]  where they already preached.
[4137.20 --> 4138.58]  And then it says this in verse 22,
[4138.70 --> 4139.66]  further down in the passage.
[4139.66 --> 4141.80]  They're going along,
[4142.02 --> 4143.38]  strengthening the disciples
[4143.38 --> 4146.70]  and encouraging them to remain true to the faith.
[4147.66 --> 4149.72]  We must go through many, what?
[4151.16 --> 4154.42]  Hardships to enter the kingdom of God.
[4155.46 --> 4156.56]  So how do you like that?
[4158.22 --> 4160.90]  How many of you are feeling deeply strengthened
[4160.90 --> 4163.76]  and encouraged by that this morning?
[4164.58 --> 4164.72]  Right?
[4164.86 --> 4166.00]  Through many hardships,
[4166.00 --> 4168.06]  you're going to enter the kingdom of God.
[4168.44 --> 4169.48]  Like what's going on here?
[4169.48 --> 4170.22]  Is this a typo?
[4171.02 --> 4173.10]  It doesn't sound very encouraging.
[4174.26 --> 4175.50]  You know, and you might think,
[4175.56 --> 4177.12]  like I thought when I first read this,
[4177.44 --> 4178.16]  like, wait a second,
[4178.58 --> 4181.42]  I thought we were already in the kingdom of God.
[4182.22 --> 4182.42]  Right?
[4182.50 --> 4184.08]  Do we need to go through hardships
[4184.08 --> 4186.90]  to qualify in some way for the kingdom of God?
[4187.08 --> 4187.36]  Right?
[4187.40 --> 4189.24]  Because that would contradict everything
[4189.24 --> 4190.88]  that Paul has ever written
[4190.88 --> 4192.00]  in the rest of the New Testament.
[4192.96 --> 4193.12]  Right?
[4193.20 --> 4193.80]  So no.
[4193.90 --> 4195.08]  But what does Paul mean here?
[4196.06 --> 4197.16]  Well, I think it's similar
[4197.16 --> 4199.86]  to the way that the Bible talks about salvation.
[4200.26 --> 4200.40]  Okay?
[4200.48 --> 4202.00]  So hang with me a second.
[4202.62 --> 4203.02]  Salvation.
[4203.28 --> 4204.76]  The Bible talks about salvation
[4204.76 --> 4207.38]  as past, present, and future.
[4207.38 --> 4208.42]  Okay?
[4208.52 --> 4210.62]  So different scriptures,
[4210.82 --> 4211.34]  they say,
[4211.78 --> 4212.24]  basically,
[4212.52 --> 4213.90]  we have been saved
[4213.90 --> 4214.96]  in the past,
[4215.22 --> 4216.82]  we are being saved,
[4217.06 --> 4219.20]  and we shall be saved,
[4219.26 --> 4221.36]  especially from the wrath of God to come.
[4222.32 --> 4223.80]  And it's the same way
[4223.80 --> 4224.80]  with the kingdom of God.
[4225.46 --> 4226.48]  There is a past,
[4226.58 --> 4226.90]  a present,
[4226.96 --> 4227.44]  and a future
[4227.44 --> 4228.46]  to the kingdom of God.
[4228.52 --> 4229.96]  So the kingdom has already come
[4229.96 --> 4230.74]  in Jesus.
[4230.94 --> 4231.90]  He inaugurated the kingdom.
[4232.98 --> 4233.74]  The kingdom
[4233.74 --> 4235.38]  is coming
[4235.38 --> 4236.20]  because right now
[4236.20 --> 4237.16]  Jesus is reigning
[4237.16 --> 4238.24]  at the right hand of God,
[4238.34 --> 4239.42]  ordering all things
[4239.42 --> 4240.58]  according to his good purposes.
[4242.58 --> 4243.32]  But still,
[4243.40 --> 4243.88]  what do we pray?
[4245.02 --> 4246.20]  Our Father in heaven,
[4246.30 --> 4247.12]  hallowed be your name,
[4247.20 --> 4247.66]  your kingdom,
[4247.80 --> 4247.98]  what?
[4247.98 --> 4248.38]  Come.
[4249.28 --> 4249.76]  Come.
[4250.32 --> 4250.46]  Right?
[4250.66 --> 4252.12]  Your kingdom come.
[4252.80 --> 4253.90]  We still pray
[4253.90 --> 4255.16]  for God's kingdom to come.
[4255.86 --> 4257.16]  To come more and more
[4257.16 --> 4258.08]  in degree,
[4258.30 --> 4258.86]  more and more
[4258.86 --> 4260.02]  in its power
[4260.02 --> 4260.62]  and fullness.
[4261.54 --> 4262.20]  And we pray
[4262.20 --> 4262.74]  that Jesus
[4262.74 --> 4263.72]  will come back soon,
[4263.78 --> 4264.38]  that his kingdom
[4264.38 --> 4265.58]  would finally come
[4265.58 --> 4266.66]  in all of its fullness
[4266.66 --> 4267.84]  and completeness.
[4268.90 --> 4269.82]  But for now,
[4270.76 --> 4271.64]  the Christian life
[4271.64 --> 4272.30]  is a journey
[4272.30 --> 4273.74]  of working out
[4273.74 --> 4274.36]  our salvation
[4274.36 --> 4277.22]  and a greater entrance
[4277.22 --> 4278.58]  into the kingdom of God.
[4279.52 --> 4280.42]  And for now,
[4280.60 --> 4281.54]  this path
[4281.54 --> 4282.56]  is paved
[4282.56 --> 4283.26]  with hardship
[4283.26 --> 4283.98]  and suffering.
[4285.06 --> 4286.00]  But sometimes
[4286.00 --> 4287.76]  we're confused
[4287.76 --> 4288.38]  about this.
[4288.78 --> 4290.12]  Sometimes people forget.
[4290.74 --> 4291.72]  We lose sight of it
[4291.72 --> 4294.10]  that the Christian life
[4294.10 --> 4295.32]  is marked by hardship.
[4296.60 --> 4296.76]  You know,
[4296.98 --> 4297.32]  Jesus,
[4297.58 --> 4298.10]  now why?
[4298.14 --> 4298.92]  Why are we so confused
[4298.92 --> 4299.46]  about this?
[4299.58 --> 4299.76]  Well,
[4300.00 --> 4301.08]  here's one reason.
[4302.66 --> 4303.66]  Jesus teaches us
[4303.66 --> 4304.00]  to pray,
[4304.18 --> 4305.64]  hallowed be what?
[4305.64 --> 4307.62]  your name.
[4312.86 --> 4314.68]  Your kingdom come.
[4315.62 --> 4317.88]  Your will be done.
[4318.62 --> 4318.78]  Right?
[4318.94 --> 4320.66]  But that goes
[4320.66 --> 4321.52]  against everything
[4321.52 --> 4323.14]  that we naturally believe.
[4323.22 --> 4324.90]  We want our kingdom
[4324.90 --> 4325.70]  to be established.
[4325.92 --> 4327.28]  We want our will
[4327.28 --> 4327.76]  to be done.
[4327.82 --> 4328.78]  We want our name
[4328.78 --> 4329.66]  to be made great.
[4330.44 --> 4330.56]  You know,
[4330.60 --> 4332.08]  and this human
[4332.08 --> 4334.08]  tendency
[4334.08 --> 4335.36]  is beautifully
[4335.36 --> 4335.88]  reflected
[4335.88 --> 4336.52]  in a poem
[4336.52 --> 4337.46]  called Invictus.
[4338.04 --> 4338.78]  And right
[4338.78 --> 4339.36]  toward the end
[4339.36 --> 4339.86]  of the poem,
[4340.82 --> 4342.08]  there it is,
[4342.62 --> 4343.02]  it says,
[4343.12 --> 4343.22]  you know,
[4343.24 --> 4344.20]  this very famous line,
[4344.36 --> 4345.32]  I am the master
[4345.32 --> 4345.90]  of my fate.
[4346.12 --> 4347.12]  I am the captain
[4347.12 --> 4347.94]  of my soul.
[4349.10 --> 4349.32]  Right?
[4349.80 --> 4350.40]  That's great.
[4350.52 --> 4350.68]  We're like,
[4350.72 --> 4350.88]  yeah.
[4351.88 --> 4352.72]  But the reason
[4352.72 --> 4353.72]  why is this so attractive
[4353.72 --> 4354.22]  to us
[4354.22 --> 4354.76]  is because
[4354.76 --> 4356.00]  these are our
[4356.00 --> 4356.98]  natural desires,
[4357.12 --> 4357.28]  right?
[4357.38 --> 4357.96]  We don't want
[4357.96 --> 4358.36]  to be told
[4358.36 --> 4358.92]  what to do.
[4359.28 --> 4360.16]  We want to feel
[4360.16 --> 4361.24]  like we're the masters
[4361.24 --> 4362.16]  of our own destiny.
[4363.24 --> 4364.32]  And we also want
[4364.32 --> 4365.10]  to believe in a God
[4365.10 --> 4365.90]  who truly loves
[4365.90 --> 4366.78]  and cares for us
[4366.78 --> 4368.48]  but doesn't make
[4368.48 --> 4369.76]  too many demands.
[4369.84 --> 4370.68]  Not too pushy.
[4371.10 --> 4371.26]  Right?
[4371.94 --> 4372.84]  And what it boils
[4372.84 --> 4373.36]  down to
[4373.36 --> 4374.22]  is that we don't
[4374.22 --> 4374.74]  like the idea
[4374.74 --> 4375.20]  of a God
[4375.20 --> 4375.86]  who is ultimately
[4375.86 --> 4376.96]  in control
[4376.96 --> 4377.92]  of our lives.
[4379.94 --> 4381.02]  So we're confused
[4381.02 --> 4381.94]  about the Christian life.
[4382.30 --> 4382.56]  You know,
[4382.60 --> 4383.06]  because if
[4383.06 --> 4384.84]  it's all about me,
[4384.94 --> 4385.64]  then why should I
[4385.64 --> 4386.16]  have to go through
[4386.16 --> 4386.46]  hardships?
[4386.46 --> 4387.14]  That's like a
[4387.14 --> 4388.28]  contradiction
[4388.28 --> 4389.42]  to the purposes,
[4389.58 --> 4389.74]  right?
[4389.92 --> 4390.50]  But no,
[4390.64 --> 4391.68]  if it's about God,
[4392.48 --> 4393.90]  then maybe God's plan
[4393.90 --> 4394.72]  and does involve
[4394.72 --> 4396.26]  not just fulfilling
[4396.26 --> 4397.32]  our own desires
[4397.32 --> 4398.90]  but to us,
[4399.16 --> 4399.74]  it might feel
[4399.74 --> 4400.20]  like hardship.
[4402.30 --> 4402.78]  Well,
[4402.92 --> 4403.60]  Paul and Barnabas,
[4403.66 --> 4404.26]  they bring clarity.
[4404.94 --> 4405.92]  They told these
[4405.92 --> 4406.88]  brand new Christians,
[4406.98 --> 4407.86]  these brand new disciples
[4407.86 --> 4409.52]  that just put their
[4409.52 --> 4410.12]  faith in Jesus
[4410.12 --> 4411.68]  through many hardships
[4411.68 --> 4412.42]  we must enter
[4412.42 --> 4413.22]  the kingdom of God.
[4413.88 --> 4414.08]  Right?
[4414.14 --> 4415.02]  The Christian life
[4415.02 --> 4416.66]  is cross-shaped.
[4416.80 --> 4417.42]  It's cruciform.
[4417.42 --> 4418.90]  It's marked by
[4418.90 --> 4420.32]  hardships and trials
[4420.32 --> 4421.12]  and sufferings.
[4421.94 --> 4422.28]  And so,
[4422.42 --> 4423.34]  in 2 Timothy,
[4423.58 --> 4424.22]  chapter 3,
[4425.08 --> 4426.08]  Paul told his
[4426.08 --> 4427.04]  protege Timothy,
[4427.22 --> 4427.52]  you know,
[4427.60 --> 4428.34]  many years later,
[4428.96 --> 4429.60]  he said this,
[4429.88 --> 4430.46]  you, Timothy,
[4430.62 --> 4430.92]  however,
[4431.42 --> 4432.28]  know all about
[4432.28 --> 4433.08]  my teaching
[4433.08 --> 4434.72]  and then listen to this,
[4434.82 --> 4435.70]  my way of life,
[4436.24 --> 4436.36]  right,
[4436.38 --> 4436.96]  the Christian life,
[4437.34 --> 4438.10]  my purpose,
[4438.84 --> 4439.62]  what I'm living for,
[4440.02 --> 4440.68]  my faith,
[4441.40 --> 4441.84]  patience,
[4442.06 --> 4442.38]  love,
[4442.84 --> 4443.32]  endurance,
[4443.72 --> 4444.22]  persecution,
[4444.48 --> 4444.94]  sufferings,
[4444.94 --> 4446.04]  what kind of things
[4446.04 --> 4446.70]  happened to me,
[4446.76 --> 4446.98]  where?
[4448.10 --> 4448.74]  Antioch,
[4449.82 --> 4450.34]  Iconium,
[4450.92 --> 4451.22]  Lystra,
[4452.12 --> 4454.08]  the persecutions I endured,
[4454.80 --> 4456.94]  yet the Lord rescued me
[4456.94 --> 4457.92]  from all of them.
[4459.44 --> 4460.02]  And then later,
[4460.10 --> 4461.44]  he wrote to the believers
[4461.44 --> 4462.06]  in Corinth,
[4462.40 --> 4463.12]  his second letter,
[4463.24 --> 4463.86]  2 Corinthians,
[4464.72 --> 4466.36]  we always carry about
[4466.36 --> 4467.26]  in our body
[4467.26 --> 4468.44]  the death of Jesus,
[4468.98 --> 4469.38]  why?
[4469.38 --> 4472.76]  So that the life of Jesus
[4472.76 --> 4474.34]  may also be revealed
[4474.34 --> 4474.96]  in our body.
[4476.34 --> 4477.34]  And that's what Paul
[4477.34 --> 4478.76]  tried so hard to do
[4478.76 --> 4479.38]  in his life,
[4479.46 --> 4480.70]  to follow Jesus
[4480.70 --> 4482.34]  in his sufferings,
[4483.28 --> 4483.42]  right,
[4483.50 --> 4484.42]  imitating Jesus
[4484.42 --> 4485.20]  who suffered
[4485.20 --> 4486.20]  for us,
[4486.70 --> 4488.16]  so that the life
[4488.16 --> 4488.62]  of Jesus
[4488.62 --> 4489.96]  might then be seen
[4489.96 --> 4490.86]  through us,
[4490.94 --> 4491.62]  through our lives.
[4494.40 --> 4496.82]  And we see Paul
[4496.82 --> 4498.38]  living the Christian life
[4498.38 --> 4498.96]  in this way
[4498.96 --> 4500.48]  in an amazing way
[4500.48 --> 4501.16]  in this passage
[4501.16 --> 4501.88]  as an example.
[4502.06 --> 4503.34]  So let's look at this.
[4503.88 --> 4505.30]  Look at verse 19.
[4505.46 --> 4506.26]  This is what happens.
[4507.64 --> 4509.24]  So these Jews
[4509.24 --> 4511.22]  from Antioch and Iconium,
[4511.42 --> 4512.42]  they actually followed
[4512.42 --> 4513.18]  Paul to Lystra,
[4513.34 --> 4514.64]  it's very persevering,
[4515.46 --> 4516.62]  won the crowd over,
[4516.76 --> 4516.90]  right,
[4516.94 --> 4517.90]  the crowd who was just
[4517.90 --> 4519.16]  about to worship to them,
[4519.50 --> 4520.20]  won them over,
[4520.90 --> 4521.72]  they together,
[4521.92 --> 4522.60]  Jews and Gentiles,
[4522.88 --> 4523.66]  stoned Paul.
[4523.82 --> 4524.52]  They finally did it,
[4524.52 --> 4524.64]  right,
[4524.68 --> 4525.36]  they've been trying to,
[4525.70 --> 4526.30]  stoned Paul,
[4526.54 --> 4527.16]  they dragged him
[4527.16 --> 4527.98]  outside the city
[4527.98 --> 4529.30]  thinking he was dead.
[4529.96 --> 4530.96]  But after the disciples
[4530.96 --> 4531.96]  gathered around him,
[4532.10 --> 4532.80]  he got up
[4532.80 --> 4534.00]  and went back
[4534.00 --> 4534.62]  into the city.
[4535.14 --> 4535.72]  The next day,
[4535.78 --> 4536.28]  he and Barnabas
[4536.28 --> 4536.94]  left for Derbe.
[4537.66 --> 4540.24]  So Paul is so injured
[4540.24 --> 4541.26]  by the stoning
[4541.26 --> 4542.06]  that his attackers
[4542.06 --> 4543.02]  thought he was dead.
[4543.78 --> 4544.60]  Was he dead?
[4545.32 --> 4546.18]  It doesn't say.
[4546.94 --> 4547.44]  I wonder,
[4547.54 --> 4548.08]  is it a miracle?
[4548.22 --> 4548.74]  We don't know.
[4549.26 --> 4550.36]  But notice what happens.
[4550.48 --> 4551.28]  He gets up
[4551.28 --> 4552.68]  and he walks back
[4552.68 --> 4554.08]  into the city
[4554.08 --> 4554.56]  where they just
[4554.56 --> 4555.18]  tried to kill him.
[4555.74 --> 4556.46]  That's crazy.
[4557.62 --> 4558.62]  And the text simply
[4558.62 --> 4559.28]  then says,
[4559.52 --> 4560.10]  the next day,
[4560.20 --> 4560.74]  he and Barnabas
[4560.74 --> 4561.34]  left for Derbe.
[4561.88 --> 4562.10]  Okay,
[4562.98 --> 4564.18]  Lystra to Derbe,
[4564.30 --> 4565.20]  I googled this,
[4565.74 --> 4567.40]  127 kilometers.
[4568.76 --> 4568.98]  Okay,
[4569.36 --> 4570.82]  so the day after
[4570.82 --> 4571.54]  being stoned
[4571.54 --> 4572.84]  to maybe an inch
[4572.84 --> 4573.50]  of his life,
[4574.16 --> 4574.80]  Paul walks
[4574.80 --> 4576.40]  127 kilometers
[4576.40 --> 4577.84]  to go preach
[4577.84 --> 4578.50]  the gospel
[4578.50 --> 4579.32]  to the people there.
[4579.32 --> 4580.52]  All right,
[4580.58 --> 4581.54]  so let's pull up
[4581.54 --> 4582.42]  our map one more time.
[4583.46 --> 4584.68]  If you look at the map again,
[4584.78 --> 4585.26]  where's Derbe?
[4585.36 --> 4585.92]  You see it's like
[4585.92 --> 4586.72]  right in the middle.
[4587.70 --> 4587.86]  Okay,
[4587.94 --> 4589.10]  now from Derbe,
[4589.62 --> 4590.90]  what happens is
[4590.90 --> 4592.44]  they circle back
[4592.44 --> 4594.72]  to all of these towns.
[4595.18 --> 4595.20]  Now,
[4596.14 --> 4596.82]  but the thing is,
[4596.90 --> 4597.76]  what is the quickest way
[4597.76 --> 4598.40]  to get back
[4598.40 --> 4599.50]  to Antioch and Syria?
[4602.54 --> 4603.02]  East,
[4603.94 --> 4604.60]  right east.
[4605.00 --> 4605.40]  And,
[4606.04 --> 4606.46]  bonus,
[4606.74 --> 4607.26]  they get to go
[4607.26 --> 4607.98]  through Tarsus,
[4608.10 --> 4608.58]  which is
[4608.58 --> 4609.40]  Paul's hometown,
[4609.86 --> 4610.08]  right?
[4610.20 --> 4611.02]  He can find lodging,
[4611.14 --> 4611.42]  food,
[4611.52 --> 4612.54]  it'll be very comfortable,
[4613.00 --> 4614.22]  recover from his stoning.
[4614.86 --> 4615.78]  But what does he do?
[4617.10 --> 4617.80]  That's not what he did.
[4618.14 --> 4618.64]  He didn't take
[4618.64 --> 4619.10]  the short,
[4619.30 --> 4619.90]  easy route.
[4620.32 --> 4621.34]  He went back
[4621.34 --> 4622.88]  through all of the cities
[4622.88 --> 4623.66]  where people
[4623.66 --> 4624.66]  were trying to kill him
[4624.66 --> 4625.72]  because he wanted
[4625.72 --> 4626.36]  to minister
[4626.36 --> 4628.06]  to these new
[4628.06 --> 4629.24]  baby Christians,
[4629.54 --> 4630.30]  these new disciples.
[4631.38 --> 4632.42]  Incredible courage,
[4632.98 --> 4633.08]  right?
[4633.14 --> 4634.40]  Incredible hardship
[4634.40 --> 4635.36]  and sacrifice.
[4636.46 --> 4636.78]  And friends,
[4636.84 --> 4637.60]  this is what it looks like
[4637.60 --> 4638.18]  to follow Jesus.
[4639.28 --> 4639.42]  Right?
[4639.48 --> 4640.08]  To boldly
[4640.08 --> 4640.86]  and courageously
[4640.86 --> 4642.68]  move towards difficulty
[4642.68 --> 4643.66]  for the sake
[4643.66 --> 4644.20]  of the gospel,
[4644.32 --> 4644.76]  for the sake
[4644.76 --> 4645.32]  of others.
[4645.90 --> 4646.14]  Right?
[4646.16 --> 4646.86]  Not to just seek
[4646.86 --> 4647.34]  a safe,
[4647.46 --> 4647.82]  easy,
[4648.36 --> 4649.36]  prosperous life,
[4649.90 --> 4650.78]  but to trust
[4650.78 --> 4651.42]  that the Lord
[4651.42 --> 4652.54]  will care for us
[4652.54 --> 4653.96]  even as we put
[4653.96 --> 4654.72]  ourselves
[4654.72 --> 4655.40]  on the line
[4655.40 --> 4656.02]  for others.
[4657.10 --> 4657.28]  You know,
[4657.36 --> 4659.08]  and like in
[4659.08 --> 4659.48]  Lystra,
[4659.72 --> 4660.52]  like these
[4660.52 --> 4661.10]  worshiping
[4661.10 --> 4661.98]  and these Greek gods,
[4662.10 --> 4662.20]  you know,
[4662.24 --> 4662.94]  so many people
[4662.94 --> 4663.62]  use religion
[4663.62 --> 4664.46]  as a means
[4664.46 --> 4665.82]  for themselves.
[4666.44 --> 4666.60]  Right?
[4666.60 --> 4667.40]  To get ahead
[4667.40 --> 4667.90]  in life.
[4668.56 --> 4668.78]  You know,
[4668.82 --> 4670.12]  and for the Greco-Roman gods,
[4670.20 --> 4670.36]  you know,
[4670.42 --> 4671.54]  if you were a farmer,
[4671.68 --> 4672.24]  you would pray
[4672.24 --> 4672.94]  to the God
[4672.94 --> 4673.76]  of the harvest
[4673.76 --> 4674.54]  and you pray
[4674.54 --> 4675.40]  that he would bless you
[4675.40 --> 4675.98]  with a harvest.
[4676.26 --> 4677.14]  If you were a soldier
[4677.14 --> 4678.88]  going to war,
[4678.94 --> 4679.40]  you might pray
[4679.40 --> 4680.16]  to the God of war
[4680.16 --> 4681.22]  that he would enable you
[4681.22 --> 4681.98]  to be strong
[4681.98 --> 4682.60]  and successful.
[4682.94 --> 4683.46]  You would pray
[4683.46 --> 4684.24]  for fortune
[4684.24 --> 4684.80]  and blessing
[4684.80 --> 4685.60]  for yourself
[4685.60 --> 4686.58]  to live a good life.
[4687.48 --> 4687.88]  But friends,
[4687.98 --> 4688.86]  Christians don't primarily
[4688.86 --> 4689.96]  pray for these things.
[4690.56 --> 4691.24]  We pray
[4691.24 --> 4692.44]  for our hearts
[4692.44 --> 4693.24]  to be changed.
[4693.92 --> 4694.44]  We pray
[4694.44 --> 4695.76]  for God's help
[4695.76 --> 4696.70]  to conquer sin
[4696.70 --> 4697.52]  in our own lives.
[4698.40 --> 4698.86]  We pray
[4698.86 --> 4699.60]  for God's kingdom
[4699.60 --> 4700.10]  to come.
[4700.64 --> 4701.24]  And we pray
[4701.24 --> 4702.46]  for other people
[4702.46 --> 4703.36]  that God's grace
[4703.36 --> 4704.10]  would come to them
[4704.10 --> 4705.64]  even if it costs us
[4705.64 --> 4706.52]  significantly.
[4707.62 --> 4708.82]  Why do we do that?
[4709.40 --> 4710.28]  It's because ultimately
[4710.28 --> 4711.02]  our hope
[4711.02 --> 4713.06]  is not having
[4713.06 --> 4714.40]  a marginally improved
[4714.40 --> 4715.62]  life here on earth.
[4716.62 --> 4717.12]  Right?
[4717.24 --> 4718.12]  But we have been welcomed
[4718.12 --> 4719.14]  into a different kingdom.
[4719.14 --> 4720.72]  And this changes
[4720.72 --> 4721.48]  the way we relate
[4721.48 --> 4722.08]  to this world.
[4722.18 --> 4722.28]  Right?
[4722.30 --> 4723.16]  We love this world.
[4723.34 --> 4724.22]  We want to serve it.
[4724.28 --> 4725.58]  We care deeply about it.
[4725.98 --> 4727.18]  But we aren't overly
[4727.18 --> 4728.20]  attached to it.
[4728.42 --> 4728.64]  Right?
[4728.66 --> 4729.64]  It's not an idol
[4729.64 --> 4730.74]  that we look
[4730.74 --> 4732.70]  to satisfy our hearts.
[4733.14 --> 4733.86]  We don't have to look
[4733.86 --> 4734.76]  to anything in this world
[4734.76 --> 4735.88]  to satisfy our hearts
[4735.88 --> 4736.78]  because we know
[4736.78 --> 4737.40]  the living God
[4737.40 --> 4738.40]  who satisfies us.
[4738.78 --> 4739.78]  So we can let it go.
[4740.26 --> 4741.58]  And we can face hardships
[4741.58 --> 4743.30]  for the sake of Christ,
[4743.52 --> 4744.58]  for the sake of the gospel.
[4744.98 --> 4745.16]  Friends,
[4745.26 --> 4745.90]  this is the way
[4745.90 --> 4746.34]  of the kingdom.
[4747.38 --> 4748.30]  Welcome to the kingdom.
[4749.14 --> 4749.36]  Right?
[4749.62 --> 4750.70]  Through many hardships
[4750.70 --> 4751.38]  we will enter
[4751.38 --> 4752.22]  in the kingdom of God
[4752.22 --> 4754.00]  currently as we seek
[4754.00 --> 4754.46]  to do so.
[4755.18 --> 4755.66]  So friends,
[4755.78 --> 4755.94]  you know,
[4756.24 --> 4756.82]  in conclusion,
[4757.36 --> 4758.82]  there is so much confusion
[4758.82 --> 4760.06]  in this life.
[4761.02 --> 4761.86]  Some of it is because
[4761.86 --> 4763.12]  we cling to worthless idols.
[4763.88 --> 4764.86]  Some of it is because
[4764.86 --> 4765.44]  we've forgotten
[4765.44 --> 4766.24]  what the Christian life
[4766.24 --> 4766.66]  is about,
[4767.32 --> 4768.32]  which is following
[4768.32 --> 4769.46]  and imitating Jesus.
[4770.82 --> 4771.54]  But you know what?
[4771.64 --> 4773.50]  Clarity always comes
[4773.50 --> 4774.60]  when we focus on
[4774.60 --> 4775.48]  the Lord.
[4776.56 --> 4777.64]  So let's pray together.
[4777.64 --> 4779.06]  And as we pray,
[4779.16 --> 4780.54]  I just want to give you
[4780.54 --> 4782.30]  a moment of quiet
[4782.30 --> 4784.14]  to prayerfully consider
[4784.14 --> 4785.10]  what God would be saying
[4785.10 --> 4787.16]  to you in this passage.
[4788.58 --> 4788.74]  You know,
[4788.84 --> 4790.42]  pray for how God
[4790.42 --> 4791.74]  might be revealing
[4791.74 --> 4792.44]  in your life
[4792.44 --> 4793.98]  what you are clinging to
[4793.98 --> 4795.30]  that is like
[4795.30 --> 4796.04]  a worthless idol.
[4797.68 --> 4798.98]  Pray that he would help you
[4798.98 --> 4800.70]  to let go of that
[4800.70 --> 4801.98]  and to turn
[4801.98 --> 4802.80]  to the living God.
[4802.80 --> 4808.06]  pray for,
[4809.14 --> 4809.42]  you know,
[4809.46 --> 4810.16]  what hardship
[4810.16 --> 4811.28]  is God asking you
[4811.28 --> 4812.20]  to accept
[4812.20 --> 4813.06]  for the sake
[4813.06 --> 4813.72]  of his kingdom?
[4813.72 --> 4813.84]  Amen.
[4829.58 --> 4830.48]  Heavenly Father,
[4830.58 --> 4831.30]  we ask that you would
[4831.30 --> 4832.62]  capture us anew
[4832.62 --> 4834.38]  with your love
[4834.38 --> 4835.04]  so that we would
[4835.04 --> 4836.22]  let go of the idols
[4836.22 --> 4836.98]  that we desperately
[4836.98 --> 4837.68]  hold on to.
[4839.10 --> 4839.46]  And Lord,
[4839.50 --> 4839.86]  would you,
[4840.24 --> 4841.00]  by your Holy Spirit,
[4841.12 --> 4842.00]  turn our hearts
[4842.00 --> 4843.12]  back to the living God
[4843.12 --> 4844.68]  and make us more
[4844.68 --> 4845.30]  like Jesus
[4845.30 --> 4845.84]  who is willing
[4845.84 --> 4846.82]  to endure the cross
[4846.82 --> 4847.56]  for the others
[4847.56 --> 4849.22]  out of love
[4849.22 --> 4849.94]  for you.
[4851.40 --> 4851.74]  And Lord,
[4851.80 --> 4852.22]  would you,
[4852.60 --> 4853.40]  by your Holy Spirit,
[4853.52 --> 4854.06]  help us
[4854.06 --> 4855.52]  to follow Jesus
[4855.52 --> 4857.68]  and to worship you alone.
[4858.26 --> 4859.28]  We pray all these things
[4859.28 --> 4860.16]  in your holy name.
[4860.80 --> 4861.08]  Amen.
[4864.40 --> 4864.78]  All right,
[4864.82 --> 4865.36]  let's stand
[4865.36 --> 4865.80]  and let's sing
[4865.80 --> 4866.42]  our song of response.
[4866.42 --> 4866.74]  Thank you.
[4866.74 --> 4879.98]  who has left the oceans
[4879.98 --> 4881.70]  in his hands,
[4881.70 --> 4882.70]  Amen.
[4911.70 --> 4913.70]  Amen.
[4941.70 --> 4943.70]  Amen.
[4971.70 --> 4973.70]  Amen.
[5001.70 --> 5003.70]  Amen.
[5031.70 --> 5032.70]  Amen.
[5058.20 --> 5060.94]  So we will continue to worship the Lord
[5060.94 --> 5065.90]  by the giving of our tithes and offerings and this is one way that we have showed that we're
[5065.90 --> 5070.86]  not holding on to the things of the world but we're willing to endure hardship for the sake of
[5070.86 --> 5077.90]  the gospel and so our as was announced earlier our offering the designated offering is for our
