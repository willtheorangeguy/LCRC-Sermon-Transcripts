[545.70 --> 549.26]  Christ from the right hand of the Heavenly Father.
[549.26 --> 556.78]  O God, receive our worship, meet with us, teach us from your word, strengthen our hearts,
[556.78 --> 562.80]  and make the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts to be acceptable in your sight
[562.80 --> 567.38]  through our rock and our Redeemer, even Jesus Christ our Lord.
[567.38 --> 568.38]  Amen.
[568.38 --> 576.14]  At this time, it's a good time to stand up, greet those around you if you're able, and
[576.14 --> 577.42]  then we'll spend some time in praise.
[598.38 --> 606.14]  Amen.
[606.14 --> 618.90]  Welcome to this service, and we're going to sing a couple familiar carols in a slightly
[618.90 --> 627.66]  different way of leadership. We've got both English and Chinese words on the screen, and
[627.66 --> 631.66]  we'll take turns leading you, but whatever you see in your language on the screen, you
[631.66 --> 641.42]  sing, okay? So we'll have, say, the first verse will be everyone singing the first verse of
[641.42 --> 653.18]  the joy to the world. The Chinese leadership will take the mikes in the first verse, and we'll
[653.18 --> 655.18]  alternate back and forth. But again, if you see something you can read on the screen, you
[655.18 --> 668.94]  go ahead and praise with all the sound that we have going this morning. So wonderful to sing these songs
[668.94 --> 682.70]  together on this day. Joy to the world.
[682.70 --> 696.46]  Joy to the world.
[696.46 --> 710.98]  Joy to the world.
[711.18 --> 715.64]  Joy to the world.
[716.28 --> 717.46]  Joy to the air.
[717.46 --> 747.44]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[747.46 --> 777.44]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[777.46 --> 787.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[787.46 --> 799.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[799.46 --> 809.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[809.46 --> 819.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[819.46 --> 829.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[829.46 --> 835.46]  Joy to the end, a faithful way.
[835.46 --> 839.50]  And I'd invite the choir to come on forward for sharing our song.
[843.50 --> 844.46]  Oh, oh, sorry.
[844.46 --> 845.10]  Sorry.
[846.46 --> 847.40]  All right.

[956.94 --> 961.26]  Failed in glory, the deity
[961.26 --> 967.06]  Is there still with us to dwell?

[972.62 --> 977.26]  Far will her old angels sing
[977.26 --> 985.26]  Glory to the newborn King
[985.26 --> 989.26]  In the heaven of Christ
[989.26 --> 995.26]  There was the righteous God
[995.26 --> 1001.26]  By death's sight, old in Christ
[1001.26 --> 1005.26]  She will be the only nations
[1005.26 --> 1007.26]  She will be the only nations
[1007.26 --> 1009.26]  She will be the only nations
[1009.26 --> 1011.26]  For the Lord

[1250.26 --> 1252.26]  Thank you.
[1252.26 --> 1254.26]  Thank you.
[1254.26 --> 1270.58]  O holy night, shepherds hear the angels sing, glory to the newborn King.
[1270.58 --> 1282.34]  God has now begun its end, the Word has come to end.
[1284.48 --> 1294.70]  O holy night, Christ has come to bring us night.
[1294.70 --> 1315.92]  O holy night, O holy night.
[1315.92 --> 1326.92]  O holy night, O holy night.
[1328.92 --> 1341.92]  O holy night, O holy night.
[1345.92 --> 1375.90]  O holy night.
[1375.90 --> 1377.90]  O holy night.
[1377.90 --> 1381.90]  O holy night.
[1381.90 --> 1383.90]  O holy night.
[1383.90 --> 1384.90]  O holy night.
[1384.90 --> 1386.90]  O holy night.
[1386.90 --> 1388.90]  I'm so sorry.
[1388.90 --> 1393.60]  Apparently all the kids get out of here.
[1393.72 --> 1395.28]  Like you've got to go to a practice or something.
[1395.28 --> 1395.84]  Yeah.
[1408.84 --> 1410.14]  While they're heading out,
[1410.28 --> 1412.28]  our first scripture reading this morning
[1412.28 --> 1413.92]  is from John chapter 1.
[1414.52 --> 1415.86]  It's not going to be on the screen,
[1416.06 --> 1418.10]  so if you wish to follow along in your Bible,
[1418.10 --> 1419.62]  the Brown Bible's in the pews.
[1419.76 --> 1421.36]  It's on page 788.
[1439.62 --> 1442.34]  So John chapter 1, verses 1 through 14.
[1444.64 --> 1446.14]  In the beginning was the Word,
[1446.14 --> 1447.96]  and the Word was with God,
[1448.10 --> 1449.52]  and the Word was God.
[1450.14 --> 1451.80]  He was with God in the beginning.
[1452.68 --> 1454.32]  Through Him all things were made.
[1455.02 --> 1457.36]  Without Him nothing was made that has been made.
[1458.34 --> 1459.26]  In Him was life,
[1459.84 --> 1461.42]  and that life was the light of men.
[1462.28 --> 1464.00]  The light shines in the darkness,
[1464.70 --> 1466.94]  but the darkness has not understood it.
[1468.00 --> 1470.16]  There came a man who was sent from God.
[1470.42 --> 1471.24]  His name was John.
[1471.24 --> 1475.28]  He came as a witness to testify concerning that light,
[1475.28 --> 1478.20]  so that through Him all men might behave.
[1479.94 --> 1481.80]  He Himself was not the light.
[1482.08 --> 1484.26]  He came only as a witness to the light.
[1484.92 --> 1487.42]  The true light that gives light to every man
[1487.42 --> 1488.78]  was coming into the world.
[1489.62 --> 1490.86]  He was in the world,
[1491.08 --> 1493.20]  and though the world was made through Him,
[1493.38 --> 1495.12]  the world did not recognize Him.
[1495.12 --> 1497.76]  He came to that which was His own,
[1498.24 --> 1499.82]  but His own did not receive Him.
[1500.66 --> 1502.20]  Yet to all who received Him,
[1502.82 --> 1504.64]  to those who believed in His name,
[1505.08 --> 1507.30]  He gave the right to become children of God,
[1508.16 --> 1510.16]  children born not of natural descent,
[1510.38 --> 1511.88]  nor of human decision,
[1512.32 --> 1513.36]  or a husband's will,
[1513.74 --> 1514.78]  but born of God.
[1514.78 --> 1517.06]  The Word became flesh
[1517.06 --> 1518.76]  and made His dwelling among us.
[1519.42 --> 1520.64]  We have seen His glory,
[1521.20 --> 1522.84]  the glory of the One and Only,
[1523.20 --> 1524.44]  who came from the Father,
[1524.64 --> 1526.16]  full of grace and truth.
[1528.18 --> 1529.82]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1535.14 --> 1537.26]  God of our light and salvation,
[1538.02 --> 1539.16]  the bright morning star,
[1539.64 --> 1542.52]  we confess that we have grown accustomed to darkness.
[1542.52 --> 1544.44]  In Your light,
[1544.68 --> 1547.12]  we see challenges to our stability and comfort.
[1547.72 --> 1550.12]  We look at ourselves and into our own hearts
[1550.12 --> 1551.40]  and deepest thoughts,
[1551.68 --> 1553.86]  and we do not like what You show us.
[1554.92 --> 1556.34]  Forgive us our many sins.
[1557.28 --> 1559.36]  In this season of Advent and beyond,
[1559.68 --> 1561.44]  teach us to walk in Your light,
[1562.36 --> 1563.96]  in the power of Your Holy Spirit,
[1564.14 --> 1566.12]  as disciples of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1566.44 --> 1566.74]  Amen.
[1568.90 --> 1570.76]  Our assurance of pardon this morning
[1570.76 --> 1571.80]  comes from 1 Peter.
[1571.80 --> 1573.06]  Chapter 2.
[1573.96 --> 1575.50]  Once you were not a people,
[1576.24 --> 1577.64]  but now you are God's people.
[1578.36 --> 1580.02]  Once you had not received mercy,
[1580.18 --> 1581.62]  but now you have received mercy.
[1582.28 --> 1583.76]  You are God's own people,
[1584.00 --> 1585.58]  in order that you may proclaim
[1585.58 --> 1586.82]  the mighty acts of Him
[1586.82 --> 1588.52]  who called you out of darkness
[1588.52 --> 1590.36]  into this marvelous light.
[1591.22 --> 1593.14]  Receive the good news of the gospel.
[1593.64 --> 1594.52]  In Jesus Christ,
[1594.72 --> 1595.80]  we are forgiven.
[1596.20 --> 1596.44]  Forgiven.
[1596.44 --> 1600.38]  Once in Royal David City is our next song.
[1600.56 --> 1601.86]  We'll invite our praise team up for that.
[1609.14 --> 1610.22]  And please stand.
[1610.22 --> 1610.36]  Amen.
[1610.36 --> 1611.22]  Amen.
[1611.22 --> 1611.60]  Amen.
[1611.70 --> 1611.92]  Amen.
[1611.98 --> 1612.38]  Amen.
[1612.38 --> 1612.58]  Amen.
[1615.02 --> 1615.78]  Amen.
[1615.78 --> 1616.02]  Amen.
[1616.48 --> 1616.78]  Amen.
[1616.78 --> 1617.18]  Amen.
[1617.18 --> 1617.26]  Amen.
[1618.06 --> 1618.96]  Amen.
[1619.02 --> 1619.40]  Amen.
[1619.40 --> 1620.18]  Amen.
[1620.18 --> 1622.96]  Amen.
[1622.96 --> 1623.58]  Amen.
[1623.58 --> 1624.36]  Amen.
[1624.36 --> 1625.56]  Amen.
[1626.56 --> 1627.22]  Amen.
[1627.22 --> 1627.80]  Amen.
[1627.80 --> 1628.12]  Amen.
[1628.12 --> 1628.86]  Amen.
[1628.86 --> 1630.88]  Amen.
[1630.88 --> 1632.80]  plants come always
[1633.54 --> 1633.58]  way
[1633.58 --> 1647.44]  to see
[1647.44 --> 1657.68]  every
[1657.68 --> 1662.58]  Jesus Christ, your little child.
[1664.40 --> 1669.46]  He came down to earth through heaven,
[1669.46 --> 1674.72]  who is God and Lord of all.
[1675.22 --> 1680.14]  And His shelter was a stable,
[1680.64 --> 1685.58]  and His cradle was a stone.
[1685.58 --> 1690.58]  With the poor and weak and holy,
[1691.38 --> 1697.08]  lived on earth our Savior holy.
[1699.30 --> 1704.74]  Jesus is our childhood's father,
[1705.30 --> 1709.66]  day by day like us He grew.
[1709.66 --> 1715.58]  He was little, wicked, helpless,
[1716.16 --> 1720.90]  tears and smiles like us He knew.
[1721.54 --> 1726.54]  And He feels for all our sadness,
[1727.12 --> 1733.66]  and He shares in all our gladness.
[1733.66 --> 1741.16]  When our eyes and eyes shall see Him,
[1741.66 --> 1746.66]  through His own redeeming love,
[1747.66 --> 1752.66]  through the child so dear and gentle,
[1752.66 --> 1758.66]  He's our Lord who we're left above.
[1759.66 --> 1765.66]  And He leads His children on
[1765.66 --> 1772.16]  to the places where He has gone.
[1772.16 --> 1776.04]  Amen.
[1776.04 --> 1776.92]  You may be seated.
[1784.78 --> 1786.70]  All right, and so some of the older children
[1786.70 --> 1787.98]  may have already come back,
[1788.18 --> 1788.90]  so don't be alarmed.
[1788.96 --> 1789.76]  That's intended.
[1789.76 --> 1802.04]  I forgot my Bible.
[1802.04 --> 1803.04]  Let me...
[1803.04 --> 1815.38]  Okay, so please turn to our passage this morning,
[1815.52 --> 1818.58]  which is Isaiah chapter 9, verses 1 through 3.
[1818.58 --> 1822.64]  And in your pew Bible, that is on page 515.
[1824.56 --> 1826.24]  So you can turn there.
[1833.86 --> 1837.16]  And so we are continuing our Advent series this morning,
[1837.40 --> 1841.72]  looking at some of the prophecies in the book of Isaiah
[1841.72 --> 1843.64]  about Jesus' birth.
[1843.96 --> 1847.78]  And we've been following the outline of the Oantiphots.
[1847.78 --> 1850.98]  Okay, the O Antiphons is a series of seven short prayers
[1850.98 --> 1854.22]  that the historic Christian church has been using
[1854.22 --> 1858.18]  since the fourth century to celebrate Advent.
[1859.04 --> 1863.80]  And each one of these antiphons turns our eyes to Jesus,
[1864.46 --> 1869.62]  right, addressing Him with one of seven different names
[1869.62 --> 1873.30]  or titles for the coming Messiah.
[1873.30 --> 1878.56]  So far, we've looked at Jesus as wisdom and Lord,
[1879.28 --> 1882.00]  the root of Jesse, and the key of David.
[1882.94 --> 1886.42]  And today we're looking at the fifth of these names for Jesus,
[1886.66 --> 1890.06]  and it comes from the Latin word oriens,
[1891.00 --> 1893.16]  which simply means the east.
[1893.16 --> 1897.80]  And so Oriens is a reference to the sunrise
[1897.80 --> 1901.42]  or the day spring, as it's sometimes called.
[1902.30 --> 1904.02]  And so let's read our passage this morning.
[1904.66 --> 1909.56]  Isaiah chapter 9, verses 1 through 3.
[1910.36 --> 1911.50]  Hear the word of the Lord.
[1911.50 --> 1916.64]  Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom
[1916.64 --> 1918.38]  for those who are in distress.
[1919.34 --> 1922.28]  In the past, He humbled the land of Zebulun
[1922.28 --> 1924.08]  and the land of Naphtali.
[1924.70 --> 1928.40]  But in the future, He will honor Galilee of the Gentiles
[1928.40 --> 1931.34]  by the way of the sea along the Jordan.
[1932.58 --> 1936.84]  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[1936.84 --> 1940.00]  On those living in the land of the shadow of death,
[1940.72 --> 1942.04]  a light has dawned.
[1942.58 --> 1946.74]  You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy.
[1947.44 --> 1951.20]  They rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest,
[1951.58 --> 1955.56]  as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.
[1956.26 --> 1957.68]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1959.36 --> 1961.92]  Let's come before God together in prayer
[1961.92 --> 1963.54]  as we open up His word together.
[1963.66 --> 1964.04]  Let's pray.
[1964.04 --> 1966.98]  Heavenly Father, again this morning,
[1967.10 --> 1968.34]  we thank You for Your word,
[1968.70 --> 1971.08]  which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[1972.16 --> 1974.62]  And Lord, as You enabled Isaiah long ago
[1974.62 --> 1976.88]  to write these words of prophecy
[1976.88 --> 1979.16]  about the coming of the Messiah,
[1980.44 --> 1982.66]  we pray that You would also make it
[1982.66 --> 1985.50]  come alive to us this morning.
[1986.00 --> 1988.02]  Lord, by Your grace and by Your mercy
[1988.02 --> 1989.64]  and by the working of Your Holy Spirit
[1989.64 --> 1993.38]  so that we would be changed by it.
[1994.04 --> 1997.44]  We pray in Jesus' name and for His sake.
[1997.88 --> 1998.16]  Amen.
[1999.88 --> 2002.30]  So I've shared a couple times already
[2002.30 --> 2006.48]  about this trip I took to Egypt and Israel.
[2007.88 --> 2008.66]  Was that already?
[2009.22 --> 2010.34]  It's already been like over a year.
[2010.70 --> 2011.38]  I can't believe it.
[2012.20 --> 2014.02]  But one of the things we did in Egypt
[2014.02 --> 2017.38]  is that we got a chance to hike up Mount Sinai.
[2018.38 --> 2020.20]  And so I have a first photo.
[2020.40 --> 2021.38]  I'll show you a few photos.
[2021.52 --> 2022.50]  So there's the first one.
[2022.64 --> 2024.74]  There we are hiking up Mount Sinai.
[2024.86 --> 2026.42]  And so it was a several hour hike
[2026.42 --> 2028.64]  and by the time we got to near the top
[2028.64 --> 2030.40]  it was already becoming dark.
[2031.46 --> 2033.14]  And we had this amazing dinner
[2033.14 --> 2035.52]  that was cooked for us by the local Bedouins
[2035.52 --> 2036.64]  who live there,
[2037.12 --> 2038.58]  cooked around a campfire.
[2038.58 --> 2042.74]  And then we slept under the stars
[2042.74 --> 2045.40]  with a little camel blanket to cover us
[2045.40 --> 2046.64]  and it was freezing.
[2047.88 --> 2049.00]  I mean I couldn't believe it, right?
[2049.04 --> 2049.96]  You kind of hear on the desert
[2049.96 --> 2050.66]  it gets cold at night.
[2050.74 --> 2051.88]  Yeah, it was like zero degrees
[2051.88 --> 2053.54]  and the wind was flying over the mountain.
[2054.34 --> 2057.34]  So we got up very early to catch the sunrise
[2057.34 --> 2059.04]  and because we actually couldn't sleep
[2059.04 --> 2060.04]  because it was so cold.
[2060.72 --> 2062.02]  But we got up before the sunrise
[2062.02 --> 2064.96]  and we made a way along the craggy rocks
[2064.96 --> 2069.50]  and we found our own spots to sit and to wait.
[2070.72 --> 2072.98]  To wait for the sunrise
[2072.98 --> 2076.48]  that would bring light into our darkness
[2076.48 --> 2078.86]  and would bring warmth into our frozen bones
[2078.86 --> 2082.44]  and it would bring the cheer and comfort of a new day.
[2083.76 --> 2085.40]  And so here is another photo
[2085.40 --> 2088.90]  and finally the sun began to rise
[2088.90 --> 2091.26]  and the splinters of the light
[2091.26 --> 2093.42]  began to spread across the horizon
[2093.42 --> 2096.36]  bringing light and life and beauty
[2096.36 --> 2098.10]  to the earth.
[2099.42 --> 2101.56]  And then one more photo to share.
[2102.08 --> 2104.62]  And here is a photo of the sun
[2104.62 --> 2105.54]  really coming up
[2105.54 --> 2107.56]  and spreading its light
[2107.56 --> 2110.14]  across the land onto the mountain.
[2112.00 --> 2113.76]  And the reason I am sharing this with you
[2113.76 --> 2115.64]  is that this is the picture
[2115.64 --> 2118.60]  that Isaiah is giving us
[2118.60 --> 2119.66]  in this passage this morning.
[2119.66 --> 2121.84]  God's people
[2121.84 --> 2124.34]  were waiting in darkness.
[2125.36 --> 2126.78]  They were waiting for the light
[2126.78 --> 2127.94]  of God's presence
[2127.94 --> 2130.06]  and the light of his blessing
[2130.06 --> 2132.20]  to come and to shine
[2132.20 --> 2133.68]  upon them
[2133.68 --> 2134.40]  to shine
[2134.40 --> 2136.08]  into the darkness.
[2137.22 --> 2139.16]  Because Isaiah foretold
[2139.16 --> 2141.66]  that the light would come.
[2142.86 --> 2144.00]  It would come.
[2144.48 --> 2145.62]  And it turns out that
[2145.62 --> 2146.66]  Isaiah was prophesying
[2146.66 --> 2148.96]  an event that would actually
[2148.96 --> 2149.76]  take place
[2149.76 --> 2151.98]  centuries after he spoke
[2151.98 --> 2154.06]  when God himself
[2154.06 --> 2156.06]  came into the darkness
[2156.06 --> 2156.96]  of the world
[2156.96 --> 2159.00]  as the light of the world
[2159.00 --> 2160.84]  as a child
[2160.84 --> 2162.34]  born in Bethlehem.
[2163.38 --> 2164.12]  And that's what we're going
[2164.12 --> 2165.12]  to consider this morning.
[2165.52 --> 2165.90]  Jesus
[2165.90 --> 2167.66]  as this
[2167.66 --> 2169.02]  rising light
[2169.02 --> 2170.54]  as the day spring.
[2171.34 --> 2172.78]  And as we think about that
[2172.78 --> 2173.80]  I want to begin by
[2173.80 --> 2175.18]  just thinking about this question
[2175.18 --> 2175.60]  together.
[2175.68 --> 2176.58]  And the question is
[2176.58 --> 2180.16]  who is Christmas for?
[2181.96 --> 2182.70]  I don't know if you
[2182.70 --> 2184.62]  how you would
[2184.62 --> 2185.96]  answer that question.
[2186.06 --> 2187.78]  Who is Christmas for?
[2188.82 --> 2189.96]  Now if we were going to
[2189.96 --> 2191.94]  go out and just ask people
[2191.94 --> 2192.58]  we meet
[2192.58 --> 2193.68]  who is Christmas for
[2193.68 --> 2194.80]  we would probably get
[2194.80 --> 2195.60]  a few different answers.
[2196.50 --> 2197.42]  And probably the most
[2197.42 --> 2198.60]  common answer today
[2198.60 --> 2199.52]  we would get is
[2199.52 --> 2200.96]  well Christmas is for
[2200.96 --> 2201.64]  the kids.
[2202.48 --> 2202.70]  Right?
[2202.78 --> 2203.68]  It's for the children.
[2203.68 --> 2205.50]  You know we have presents
[2205.50 --> 2206.96]  and the tree
[2206.96 --> 2208.46]  is strung with lights.
[2208.70 --> 2209.98]  You get time off school.
[2210.14 --> 2211.34]  It's all very exciting.
[2211.80 --> 2212.72]  It's very festive.
[2213.04 --> 2214.66]  It's for the kids.
[2216.28 --> 2217.56]  Now some people
[2217.56 --> 2218.54]  might kind of go
[2218.54 --> 2219.10]  a step further
[2219.10 --> 2219.74]  and say well it's not
[2219.74 --> 2220.98]  just for the kids.
[2221.48 --> 2222.90]  It's for those of us
[2222.90 --> 2223.92]  who are sentimental.
[2224.92 --> 2225.72]  Some of us you know
[2225.72 --> 2226.76]  some people are kind of
[2226.76 --> 2227.34]  Scrooge.
[2227.50 --> 2228.72]  They're kind of hard nosed.
[2229.28 --> 2230.62]  But there are some of us
[2230.62 --> 2231.64]  who actually like
[2231.64 --> 2232.66]  a bit of sentiment.
[2232.66 --> 2233.04]  Right?
[2233.12 --> 2233.66]  And Christmas
[2233.66 --> 2235.18]  in a very special way
[2235.18 --> 2236.54]  gives us a chance
[2236.54 --> 2238.06]  to be sentimental.
[2238.38 --> 2238.48]  Right?
[2238.56 --> 2239.76]  To you know
[2239.76 --> 2241.12]  have all those feelings
[2241.12 --> 2243.04]  and the joy
[2243.04 --> 2243.86]  of the season.
[2245.64 --> 2246.84]  Now other people
[2246.84 --> 2248.34]  in our kind of
[2248.34 --> 2249.40]  our cultural moment
[2249.40 --> 2249.94]  today
[2249.94 --> 2250.68]  they might say
[2250.68 --> 2251.78]  well no
[2251.78 --> 2252.26]  you know what
[2252.26 --> 2252.80]  Christmas
[2252.80 --> 2254.78]  is for Christians.
[2256.02 --> 2256.22]  You know
[2256.22 --> 2257.00]  we live in a time
[2257.00 --> 2257.46]  and a place
[2257.46 --> 2258.12]  where we want to be
[2258.12 --> 2259.66]  inclusive of people
[2259.66 --> 2260.78]  of different cultures.
[2260.78 --> 2262.42]  So kind of
[2262.42 --> 2263.52]  let's do this properly
[2263.52 --> 2265.58]  and keep each festival
[2265.58 --> 2266.68]  to its own religion.
[2267.68 --> 2268.22]  So Christmas
[2268.22 --> 2269.60]  is for Christians.
[2269.78 --> 2270.44]  Everyone else
[2270.44 --> 2270.76]  you know
[2270.76 --> 2271.92]  everyone gets their own thing
[2271.92 --> 2272.74]  and we shouldn't
[2272.74 --> 2273.36]  kind of impose
[2273.36 --> 2274.52]  our festivities
[2274.52 --> 2275.60]  on other people.
[2277.64 --> 2278.82]  Now none
[2278.82 --> 2279.92]  of those answers
[2279.92 --> 2281.54]  is what this passage says.
[2282.84 --> 2283.78]  Who would
[2283.78 --> 2285.14]  Isaiah say
[2285.14 --> 2286.26]  that Christmas
[2286.26 --> 2286.80]  is for?
[2286.80 --> 2288.86]  And if we look
[2288.86 --> 2289.78]  at this passage
[2289.78 --> 2290.80]  Christmas
[2290.80 --> 2292.48]  is for those
[2292.48 --> 2293.30]  who sit
[2293.30 --> 2293.92]  in the dark.
[2294.86 --> 2295.22]  Christmas
[2295.22 --> 2296.20]  is for those
[2296.20 --> 2297.12]  who sit
[2297.12 --> 2298.34]  in the dark.
[2298.98 --> 2299.34]  Christmas
[2299.34 --> 2300.02]  is for those
[2300.02 --> 2300.78]  who have been
[2300.78 --> 2302.24]  broken
[2302.24 --> 2304.14]  by life
[2304.14 --> 2305.06]  in this world.
[2306.02 --> 2306.50]  And so look
[2306.50 --> 2307.12]  at who is being
[2307.12 --> 2307.60]  described
[2307.60 --> 2308.50]  in verse 1.
[2308.80 --> 2309.68]  What is the type
[2309.68 --> 2310.38]  of person
[2310.38 --> 2311.02]  being described?
[2311.16 --> 2311.50]  It says
[2311.50 --> 2312.06]  verse 1
[2312.06 --> 2312.52]  nevertheless
[2312.52 --> 2313.66]  there will be
[2313.66 --> 2314.72]  no more gloom
[2314.72 --> 2315.54]  for those
[2315.54 --> 2316.78]  who were in
[2316.78 --> 2317.38]  distress.
[2319.72 --> 2320.02]  Right?
[2320.08 --> 2320.76]  He's describing
[2320.76 --> 2322.06]  people in gloom
[2322.06 --> 2323.54]  and distress.
[2324.14 --> 2324.68]  In verse 2
[2324.68 --> 2325.20]  he talks about
[2325.20 --> 2326.00]  people walking
[2326.00 --> 2326.64]  in darkness
[2326.64 --> 2327.14]  and living
[2327.14 --> 2327.80]  in a land
[2327.80 --> 2328.80]  of deep
[2328.80 --> 2329.86]  darkness.
[2331.66 --> 2332.58]  And we're also
[2332.58 --> 2333.88]  told in verse 1
[2333.88 --> 2334.58]  also that this
[2334.58 --> 2335.20]  particular
[2335.20 --> 2336.54]  place
[2336.54 --> 2338.32]  being described
[2338.32 --> 2339.20]  is
[2339.20 --> 2340.28]  Galilee.
[2341.06 --> 2341.58]  Galilee.
[2341.94 --> 2342.48]  So this is what
[2342.48 --> 2343.12]  Isaiah says.
[2343.18 --> 2343.92]  In the past
[2343.92 --> 2345.16]  he humbled
[2345.16 --> 2346.12]  the land
[2346.12 --> 2346.88]  of Zebulun
[2346.88 --> 2347.68]  and the land
[2347.68 --> 2348.90]  of Naphtali
[2348.90 --> 2350.40]  but in the future
[2350.40 --> 2351.12]  he will honor
[2351.12 --> 2352.28]  Galilee of the nations
[2352.28 --> 2353.02]  by the way
[2353.02 --> 2353.58]  of the sea
[2353.58 --> 2354.98]  beyond the Jordan.
[2356.20 --> 2357.08]  So Galilee
[2357.08 --> 2358.30]  was known
[2358.30 --> 2359.50]  as a place
[2359.50 --> 2360.66]  of gloom
[2360.66 --> 2361.60]  and anguish.
[2361.80 --> 2362.78]  It was known
[2362.78 --> 2363.60]  as a place
[2363.60 --> 2364.16]  of darkness
[2364.16 --> 2365.60]  for the very
[2365.60 --> 2366.14]  understandable
[2366.14 --> 2367.12]  reason
[2367.12 --> 2368.50]  that the people
[2368.50 --> 2368.98]  of God
[2368.98 --> 2369.42]  have
[2369.42 --> 2371.34]  frequently
[2371.34 --> 2372.28]  suffered
[2372.28 --> 2373.14]  there.
[2373.92 --> 2374.90]  More than
[2374.90 --> 2375.56]  anywhere else
[2375.56 --> 2376.24]  there was a
[2376.24 --> 2376.70]  particular
[2376.70 --> 2377.42]  place
[2377.42 --> 2378.00]  of hardship
[2378.00 --> 2379.22]  because
[2379.22 --> 2380.22]  when Joshua
[2380.22 --> 2381.36]  conquered
[2381.36 --> 2382.20]  the land
[2382.20 --> 2383.52]  and divided
[2383.52 --> 2384.24]  the land
[2384.24 --> 2385.00]  Zebulun
[2385.00 --> 2385.80]  and Naphtali
[2385.80 --> 2387.16]  received
[2387.16 --> 2388.04]  those two tribes
[2388.04 --> 2388.54]  they received
[2388.54 --> 2389.04]  the land
[2389.04 --> 2389.64]  in the far
[2389.64 --> 2390.38]  north
[2390.38 --> 2391.12]  up by the
[2391.12 --> 2391.80]  sea of Galilee
[2391.80 --> 2393.28]  and the geography
[2393.28 --> 2394.10]  of the land
[2394.10 --> 2394.62]  meant that
[2394.62 --> 2395.06]  if you were
[2395.06 --> 2395.44]  going to
[2395.44 --> 2396.64]  invade Israel
[2396.64 --> 2397.74]  you would
[2397.74 --> 2398.28]  start
[2398.28 --> 2399.44]  in Galilee.
[2400.44 --> 2400.88]  Galilee
[2400.88 --> 2401.84]  was the front
[2401.84 --> 2402.36]  door
[2402.36 --> 2403.20]  to the land
[2403.20 --> 2403.70]  of Israel
[2403.70 --> 2404.52]  and so
[2404.52 --> 2404.98]  the people
[2404.98 --> 2405.70]  in Galilee
[2405.70 --> 2406.08]  were the
[2406.08 --> 2406.68]  first
[2406.68 --> 2407.60]  to be
[2407.60 --> 2408.10]  attacked
[2408.10 --> 2408.70]  and to be
[2408.70 --> 2409.18]  captured
[2409.18 --> 2410.16]  and to be
[2410.16 --> 2410.52]  taken
[2410.52 --> 2411.68]  into captivity
[2411.68 --> 2412.32]  in Assyria
[2412.32 --> 2413.64]  and so
[2413.64 --> 2414.42]  these people
[2414.42 --> 2415.54]  they knew
[2415.54 --> 2417.14]  deep darkness
[2417.14 --> 2418.32]  right
[2418.32 --> 2418.80]  they knew
[2418.80 --> 2419.34]  oppression
[2419.34 --> 2420.26]  they knew
[2420.26 --> 2420.88]  fear
[2420.88 --> 2422.06]  and grief
[2422.06 --> 2422.74]  and they knew
[2422.74 --> 2423.30]  heartache
[2423.30 --> 2424.02]  and they knew
[2424.02 --> 2425.32]  armies at their
[2425.32 --> 2425.62]  door
[2425.62 --> 2426.12]  and siege
[2426.12 --> 2426.46]  warfare
[2426.46 --> 2427.28]  and violence
[2427.28 --> 2429.64]  they knew
[2429.64 --> 2430.16]  darkness
[2430.16 --> 2431.72]  and that
[2431.72 --> 2432.42]  same shadow
[2432.42 --> 2433.12]  of darkness
[2433.12 --> 2434.26]  stretches
[2434.26 --> 2435.28]  over our
[2435.28 --> 2435.80]  lives
[2435.80 --> 2437.02]  as well
[2437.02 --> 2437.96]  not in
[2437.96 --> 2438.72]  exactly the
[2438.72 --> 2439.26]  same way
[2439.26 --> 2440.18]  thankfully
[2440.18 --> 2441.46]  we don't
[2441.46 --> 2442.74]  currently have
[2442.74 --> 2443.26]  to fear
[2443.26 --> 2444.08]  an invading
[2444.08 --> 2444.44]  army
[2444.44 --> 2446.60]  but for many
[2446.60 --> 2447.02]  of us
[2447.02 --> 2447.40]  still
[2447.40 --> 2448.62]  we've
[2448.62 --> 2449.32]  experienced
[2449.32 --> 2450.16]  the gloom
[2450.16 --> 2450.76]  and the
[2450.76 --> 2451.18]  distress
[2451.18 --> 2452.48]  that life
[2452.48 --> 2453.20]  can bring
[2453.20 --> 2454.08]  in this
[2454.08 --> 2454.50]  world of
[2454.50 --> 2454.76]  sin
[2454.76 --> 2456.42]  right
[2456.42 --> 2456.74]  and for
[2456.74 --> 2457.10]  some of
[2457.10 --> 2457.26]  us
[2457.26 --> 2457.44]  you know
[2457.44 --> 2457.74]  that might
[2457.74 --> 2458.58]  be a
[2458.58 --> 2458.92]  broken
[2458.92 --> 2459.56]  relationship
[2459.56 --> 2460.64]  that is
[2460.64 --> 2460.78]  so
[2460.78 --> 2461.28]  heartbreaking
[2461.28 --> 2462.92]  for
[2462.92 --> 2463.68]  some of
[2463.68 --> 2463.80]  us
[2463.80 --> 2464.10]  that might
[2464.10 --> 2464.42]  be our
[2464.42 --> 2464.84]  health
[2464.84 --> 2466.28]  is failing
[2466.28 --> 2467.34]  seems to
[2467.34 --> 2467.74]  be falling
[2467.74 --> 2468.12]  apart
[2468.12 --> 2470.20]  for some
[2470.20 --> 2470.50]  of us
[2470.50 --> 2470.76]  it might
[2470.76 --> 2471.48]  be profound
[2471.48 --> 2472.16]  loss
[2472.16 --> 2472.88]  you know
[2472.88 --> 2473.38]  maybe this
[2473.38 --> 2473.80]  Christmas
[2473.80 --> 2474.28]  we are
[2474.28 --> 2475.10]  maybe the
[2475.10 --> 2475.84]  first Christmas
[2475.84 --> 2476.26]  without
[2476.26 --> 2476.84]  someone
[2476.84 --> 2479.48]  maybe it's
[2479.48 --> 2480.00]  financial
[2480.00 --> 2480.68]  uncertainty
[2480.68 --> 2483.22]  but the
[2483.22 --> 2483.82]  good news
[2483.82 --> 2484.14]  of this
[2484.14 --> 2484.66]  passage
[2484.66 --> 2486.22]  is that
[2486.22 --> 2486.94]  God doesn't
[2486.94 --> 2487.58]  come into
[2487.58 --> 2487.98]  the world
[2487.98 --> 2488.38]  just to
[2488.38 --> 2489.18]  congratulate
[2489.18 --> 2490.42]  all those
[2490.42 --> 2490.94]  who actually
[2490.94 --> 2491.48]  have got
[2491.48 --> 2492.28]  life together
[2492.28 --> 2493.74]  right
[2493.74 --> 2494.64]  God doesn't
[2494.64 --> 2495.08]  come into
[2495.08 --> 2495.44]  the world
[2495.44 --> 2496.32]  just for
[2496.32 --> 2497.34]  the excited
[2497.34 --> 2497.78]  kids
[2497.78 --> 2499.00]  he doesn't
[2499.00 --> 2499.44]  come only
[2499.44 --> 2499.88]  for those
[2499.88 --> 2500.42]  who love
[2500.42 --> 2501.54]  the sentimentality
[2501.54 --> 2502.18]  of the season
[2502.18 --> 2503.80]  he doesn't
[2503.80 --> 2504.36]  exclude
[2504.36 --> 2504.98]  anyone
[2504.98 --> 2507.20]  God has
[2507.20 --> 2507.68]  come for
[2507.68 --> 2508.24]  those sitting
[2508.24 --> 2508.70]  in a world
[2508.70 --> 2509.32]  of darkness
[2509.32 --> 2510.52]  and friends
[2510.52 --> 2511.24]  that means
[2511.24 --> 2511.76]  Christmas
[2511.76 --> 2513.04]  is for
[2513.04 --> 2513.48]  everyone
[2513.48 --> 2515.46]  so on
[2515.46 --> 2515.78]  the one
[2515.78 --> 2516.00]  hand
[2516.00 --> 2516.24]  there's
[2516.24 --> 2516.40]  this
[2516.40 --> 2516.86]  darkness
[2516.86 --> 2517.38]  of the
[2517.38 --> 2517.68]  world
[2517.68 --> 2518.02]  that
[2518.02 --> 2518.54]  the
[2518.54 --> 2518.76]  people
[2518.76 --> 2518.90]  of
[2518.90 --> 2519.22]  Israel
[2519.22 --> 2519.60]  and we
[2519.60 --> 2519.92]  today
[2519.92 --> 2520.28]  still
[2520.28 --> 2520.94]  experience
[2520.94 --> 2522.08]  but there's
[2522.08 --> 2522.70]  also another
[2522.70 --> 2523.42]  kind of darkness
[2523.42 --> 2523.94]  as well
[2523.94 --> 2524.44]  and it's a
[2524.44 --> 2524.90]  spiritual
[2524.90 --> 2525.48]  darkness
[2525.48 --> 2527.24]  the Bible
[2527.24 --> 2527.88]  tells us
[2527.88 --> 2528.26]  that by
[2528.26 --> 2528.62]  nature
[2528.62 --> 2529.18]  all of
[2529.18 --> 2529.48]  us
[2529.48 --> 2530.30]  spiritually
[2530.30 --> 2531.04]  are people
[2531.04 --> 2531.74]  who walk
[2531.74 --> 2532.42]  in darkness
[2532.42 --> 2534.08]  so you know
[2534.08 --> 2534.74]  Jesus on one
[2534.74 --> 2535.14]  occasion
[2535.14 --> 2536.12]  in John
[2536.12 --> 2537.54]  chapter 3
[2537.54 --> 2538.10]  he says
[2538.10 --> 2538.86]  unless someone
[2538.86 --> 2539.68]  is born again
[2539.68 --> 2540.36]  he cannot
[2540.36 --> 2541.04]  see the
[2541.04 --> 2541.32]  kingdom
[2541.32 --> 2541.96]  of heaven
[2541.96 --> 2543.70]  right
[2543.70 --> 2544.12]  not just
[2544.12 --> 2544.38]  that you
[2544.38 --> 2544.74]  can't
[2544.74 --> 2545.20]  enter the
[2545.20 --> 2545.38]  kingdom
[2545.38 --> 2545.84]  of heaven
[2545.84 --> 2546.92]  or you
[2546.92 --> 2547.16]  know be
[2547.16 --> 2547.62]  part of
[2547.62 --> 2547.94]  the kingdom
[2547.94 --> 2548.38]  of heaven
[2548.38 --> 2549.50]  we can't
[2549.50 --> 2550.60]  even see
[2550.60 --> 2551.54]  the kingdom
[2551.54 --> 2552.14]  of heaven
[2552.14 --> 2553.56]  unless
[2553.56 --> 2554.78]  we are born
[2554.78 --> 2555.42]  again
[2555.42 --> 2557.46]  and then in
[2557.46 --> 2558.02]  John chapter
[2558.02 --> 2558.88]  3 verse 19
[2558.88 --> 2560.40]  he says
[2560.40 --> 2561.42]  light has come
[2561.42 --> 2562.28]  into the world
[2562.28 --> 2562.80]  referring to
[2562.80 --> 2563.22]  himself
[2563.22 --> 2564.86]  but people
[2564.86 --> 2565.56]  loved
[2565.56 --> 2567.30]  the darkness
[2567.30 --> 2568.66]  instead of
[2568.66 --> 2568.94]  light
[2568.94 --> 2569.88]  because
[2569.88 --> 2571.16]  their deeds
[2571.16 --> 2572.24]  were evil
[2572.24 --> 2574.04]  and so
[2574.04 --> 2574.60]  Jesus is
[2574.60 --> 2575.00]  saying
[2575.00 --> 2576.88]  and yes
[2576.88 --> 2577.36]  it is very
[2577.36 --> 2577.96]  unflattering
[2577.96 --> 2580.38]  but he is
[2580.38 --> 2580.74]  saying that
[2580.74 --> 2581.40]  by nature
[2581.40 --> 2582.02]  we're all
[2582.02 --> 2582.92]  spiritually blind
[2582.92 --> 2584.38]  by nature
[2584.38 --> 2585.66]  we walk
[2585.66 --> 2587.22]  in spiritual
[2587.22 --> 2587.70]  darkness
[2587.70 --> 2589.58]  and this is
[2589.58 --> 2590.04]  true of all
[2590.04 --> 2590.50]  of us
[2590.50 --> 2593.36]  which is
[2593.36 --> 2593.78]  why
[2593.78 --> 2594.74]  this hope
[2594.74 --> 2595.28]  and promise
[2595.28 --> 2596.18]  in verse 2
[2596.18 --> 2597.10]  is so
[2597.10 --> 2597.54]  wonderful
[2597.54 --> 2598.64]  because the
[2598.64 --> 2599.10]  people in
[2599.10 --> 2599.38]  darkness
[2599.38 --> 2600.04]  have seen
[2600.04 --> 2600.56]  a light
[2600.56 --> 2601.68]  so verse 2
[2601.68 --> 2603.32]  says this
[2603.32 --> 2604.60]  the people
[2604.60 --> 2606.00]  walking in
[2606.00 --> 2606.38]  darkness
[2606.38 --> 2607.34]  have seen
[2607.34 --> 2607.80]  a great
[2607.80 --> 2608.20]  light
[2608.20 --> 2609.68]  on those
[2609.68 --> 2610.76]  living in
[2610.76 --> 2611.48]  the land
[2611.48 --> 2612.22]  of deep
[2612.22 --> 2613.10]  darkness
[2613.10 --> 2614.80]  a light
[2614.80 --> 2616.10]  has
[2616.10 --> 2616.92]  dawned
[2616.92 --> 2618.98]  so the
[2618.98 --> 2619.48]  image that
[2619.48 --> 2620.14]  Isaiah gives
[2620.14 --> 2620.56]  us right
[2620.56 --> 2621.14]  is of this
[2621.14 --> 2622.42]  light of dawn
[2622.42 --> 2623.28]  rising up
[2623.28 --> 2623.72]  over the
[2623.72 --> 2624.20]  horizon
[2624.20 --> 2625.34]  and the
[2625.34 --> 2625.58]  light
[2625.58 --> 2626.10]  flooding
[2626.10 --> 2626.70]  over the
[2626.70 --> 2627.12]  land
[2627.12 --> 2628.12]  and mourning
[2628.12 --> 2629.44]  coming with
[2629.44 --> 2630.06]  all of its
[2630.06 --> 2631.04]  comfort
[2631.04 --> 2631.54]  and its
[2631.54 --> 2631.98]  hope
[2631.98 --> 2634.08]  and if you
[2634.08 --> 2634.48]  look again
[2634.48 --> 2635.16]  at verse 1
[2635.16 --> 2635.68]  which we'll
[2635.68 --> 2636.22]  have up here
[2636.22 --> 2637.74]  it says
[2637.74 --> 2639.84]  in the past
[2639.84 --> 2640.56]  he humbled
[2640.56 --> 2641.30]  the land of
[2641.30 --> 2641.94]  Zebulun
[2641.94 --> 2642.44]  and the land
[2642.44 --> 2644.10]  of Naphtali
[2644.10 --> 2645.50]  but
[2645.50 --> 2647.04]  in the future
[2647.04 --> 2648.68]  he will
[2648.68 --> 2649.34]  honor
[2649.34 --> 2650.72]  Galilee
[2650.72 --> 2651.06]  of the
[2651.06 --> 2651.40]  nations
[2651.40 --> 2652.30]  so what's
[2652.30 --> 2652.68]  he talking
[2652.68 --> 2653.00]  about
[2653.00 --> 2654.18]  well the
[2654.18 --> 2654.76]  gospel of
[2654.76 --> 2655.06]  Matthew
[2655.06 --> 2655.60]  opens
[2655.60 --> 2655.90]  and it
[2655.90 --> 2656.62]  tells us
[2656.62 --> 2657.38]  what
[2657.38 --> 2657.98]  Isaiah
[2657.98 --> 2658.78]  means
[2658.78 --> 2659.80]  about
[2659.80 --> 2660.20]  God
[2660.20 --> 2660.78]  honoring
[2660.78 --> 2661.76]  the land
[2661.76 --> 2662.38]  of Galilee
[2662.38 --> 2663.72]  because
[2663.72 --> 2664.66]  Matthew
[2664.66 --> 2665.48]  he quotes
[2665.48 --> 2666.78]  Isaiah 9
[2666.78 --> 2667.62]  at the
[2667.62 --> 2668.22]  beginning of
[2668.22 --> 2668.46]  Jesus'
[2668.66 --> 2668.98]  ministry
[2668.98 --> 2669.46]  as an
[2669.46 --> 2670.04]  explanation
[2670.04 --> 2670.82]  for why
[2670.82 --> 2671.46]  Jesus
[2671.46 --> 2672.32]  ministered
[2672.32 --> 2673.12]  in Galilee
[2673.12 --> 2674.32]  so this
[2674.32 --> 2674.86]  is Matthew
[2674.86 --> 2675.60]  chapter 4
[2675.60 --> 2676.74]  verses 13
[2676.74 --> 2677.36]  and 14
[2677.36 --> 2678.98]  Jesus
[2678.98 --> 2680.02]  leaving
[2680.02 --> 2680.72]  Nazareth
[2680.72 --> 2681.28]  he went
[2681.28 --> 2681.80]  and lived
[2681.80 --> 2682.68]  in Capernaum
[2682.68 --> 2683.70]  which was
[2683.70 --> 2684.44]  by the lake
[2684.44 --> 2685.42]  in the area
[2685.42 --> 2685.84]  of what
[2685.84 --> 2687.32]  Zebulun
[2687.32 --> 2688.52]  and Naphtali
[2688.52 --> 2690.28]  to fulfill
[2690.28 --> 2691.48]  what was said
[2691.48 --> 2692.36]  through the
[2692.36 --> 2692.72]  prophet
[2692.72 --> 2693.64]  Isaiah
[2693.64 --> 2695.10]  and then he
[2695.10 --> 2695.70]  quotes our
[2695.70 --> 2696.34]  scripture reading
[2696.34 --> 2696.86]  this morning
[2696.86 --> 2697.84]  land of
[2697.84 --> 2698.32]  Zebulun
[2698.32 --> 2698.84]  and land
[2698.84 --> 2699.48]  of Naphtali
[2699.48 --> 2700.02]  the way
[2700.02 --> 2700.58]  of the sea
[2700.58 --> 2701.20]  beyond the
[2701.20 --> 2701.54]  Jordan
[2701.54 --> 2702.40]  Galilee
[2702.40 --> 2703.18]  of the
[2703.18 --> 2703.72]  Gentiles
[2703.72 --> 2704.00]  of the
[2704.00 --> 2704.36]  nations
[2704.36 --> 2705.56]  the people
[2705.56 --> 2706.04]  living in
[2706.04 --> 2706.36]  darkness
[2706.36 --> 2706.80]  have seen
[2706.80 --> 2707.14]  a great
[2707.14 --> 2707.58]  light
[2707.58 --> 2708.96]  right
[2708.96 --> 2709.34]  Matthew's
[2709.34 --> 2709.82]  talking about
[2709.82 --> 2710.24]  Jesus
[2710.24 --> 2711.26]  on those
[2711.26 --> 2711.82]  living in
[2711.82 --> 2712.44]  the land
[2712.44 --> 2713.10]  of the
[2713.10 --> 2713.50]  shadow
[2713.50 --> 2714.22]  of death
[2714.22 --> 2715.36]  a light
[2715.36 --> 2716.22]  has
[2716.22 --> 2717.80]  dawned
[2717.80 --> 2719.50]  and we
[2719.50 --> 2720.24]  read something
[2720.24 --> 2721.30]  similar
[2721.30 --> 2722.36]  in the
[2722.36 --> 2722.88]  gospel of
[2722.88 --> 2723.10]  Luke
[2723.10 --> 2723.56]  in chapter
[2723.56 --> 2723.90]  one
[2723.90 --> 2724.44]  right
[2724.44 --> 2725.04]  the priest
[2725.04 --> 2725.76]  Zechariah
[2725.76 --> 2727.00]  he's singing
[2727.00 --> 2728.06]  this song
[2728.06 --> 2729.56]  praising God
[2729.56 --> 2730.58]  for keeping
[2730.58 --> 2731.38]  his promise
[2731.38 --> 2732.54]  the promise
[2732.54 --> 2733.22]  that he is
[2733.22 --> 2734.06]  going to send
[2734.06 --> 2734.80]  the Messiah
[2734.80 --> 2735.48]  that the Messiah
[2735.48 --> 2736.00]  is coming
[2736.00 --> 2737.42]  and so with
[2737.42 --> 2737.80]  the Messiah
[2737.80 --> 2738.20]  coming
[2738.20 --> 2738.54]  it says
[2738.54 --> 2738.94]  this
[2738.94 --> 2739.98]  he comes
[2739.98 --> 2740.50]  to give
[2740.50 --> 2741.20]  his people
[2741.20 --> 2742.34]  the knowledge
[2742.34 --> 2743.10]  of salvation
[2743.10 --> 2744.02]  through the
[2744.02 --> 2744.44]  forgiveness
[2744.44 --> 2744.92]  of their
[2744.92 --> 2745.36]  sins
[2745.36 --> 2746.94]  because of
[2746.94 --> 2747.62]  the tender
[2747.62 --> 2748.42]  mercy
[2748.42 --> 2749.12]  of our
[2749.12 --> 2749.56]  God
[2749.56 --> 2750.88]  by which
[2750.88 --> 2751.78]  the rising
[2751.78 --> 2752.66]  sun
[2752.66 --> 2753.84]  will come
[2753.84 --> 2754.94]  to us
[2754.94 --> 2755.64]  from heaven
[2755.64 --> 2757.84]  to shine
[2757.84 --> 2758.26]  on those
[2758.26 --> 2758.78]  living in
[2758.78 --> 2759.30]  darkness
[2759.30 --> 2760.20]  and in the
[2760.20 --> 2760.60]  shadow of
[2760.60 --> 2760.88]  death
[2760.88 --> 2761.90]  to guide
[2761.90 --> 2762.54]  our feet
[2762.54 --> 2763.26]  into the
[2763.26 --> 2763.66]  path of
[2763.66 --> 2764.06]  peace
[2764.06 --> 2765.78]  you know
[2765.78 --> 2766.10]  I think
[2766.10 --> 2766.50]  remember
[2766.50 --> 2766.82]  you know
[2766.82 --> 2767.06]  where those
[2767.06 --> 2767.44]  shepherds
[2767.44 --> 2767.74]  are out
[2767.74 --> 2768.12]  on the
[2768.12 --> 2768.66]  on those
[2768.66 --> 2769.22]  hillside
[2769.22 --> 2769.64]  at night
[2769.64 --> 2770.02]  tending
[2770.02 --> 2770.66]  their flocks
[2770.66 --> 2770.94]  right
[2770.94 --> 2772.22]  why do
[2772.22 --> 2772.78]  the angels
[2772.78 --> 2773.62]  show up
[2773.62 --> 2774.58]  and they
[2774.58 --> 2775.42]  turn the
[2775.42 --> 2776.08]  darkness
[2776.08 --> 2776.60]  of that
[2776.60 --> 2776.84]  night
[2776.84 --> 2777.58]  into bright
[2777.58 --> 2777.90]  day
[2777.90 --> 2779.22]  I think
[2779.22 --> 2779.58]  it's because
[2779.58 --> 2780.26]  it's a picture
[2780.26 --> 2780.84]  of what was
[2780.84 --> 2781.28]  happening
[2781.28 --> 2782.00]  in Bethlehem
[2782.00 --> 2783.40]  when Jesus
[2783.40 --> 2783.94]  was born
[2783.94 --> 2784.56]  the true
[2784.56 --> 2785.18]  light
[2785.18 --> 2786.08]  that gives
[2786.08 --> 2786.74]  life
[2786.74 --> 2788.02]  came into
[2788.02 --> 2788.52]  the world
[2788.52 --> 2789.16]  the light
[2789.16 --> 2790.06]  rose
[2790.06 --> 2790.44]  it was
[2790.44 --> 2790.68]  the
[2790.68 --> 2790.96]  day
[2790.96 --> 2791.26]  spring
[2791.26 --> 2792.82]  Jesus
[2792.82 --> 2793.24]  is that
[2793.24 --> 2793.48]  great
[2793.48 --> 2793.74]  light
[2793.74 --> 2794.44]  and he
[2794.44 --> 2794.72]  is that
[2794.72 --> 2795.04]  sunrise
[2795.04 --> 2795.50]  from on
[2795.50 --> 2795.76]  high
[2795.76 --> 2797.26]  so then
[2797.26 --> 2797.88]  as we
[2797.88 --> 2798.24]  continue
[2798.24 --> 2798.48]  in our
[2798.48 --> 2798.88]  passage
[2798.88 --> 2799.36]  look at
[2799.36 --> 2799.82]  what that
[2799.82 --> 2800.10]  light
[2800.10 --> 2800.84]  brings
[2800.84 --> 2801.40]  with it
[2801.40 --> 2802.26]  in verse
[2802.26 --> 2802.54]  three
[2802.54 --> 2803.70]  right
[2803.70 --> 2804.22]  gloom
[2804.22 --> 2805.18]  and anguish
[2805.18 --> 2805.88]  become
[2805.88 --> 2806.82]  joy
[2806.82 --> 2808.60]  and rejoicing
[2808.60 --> 2809.38]  so verse
[2809.38 --> 2809.68]  three
[2809.68 --> 2811.20]  you have
[2811.20 --> 2811.98]  enlarged
[2811.98 --> 2812.62]  the nation
[2812.62 --> 2814.12]  and increased
[2814.12 --> 2814.90]  their joy
[2814.90 --> 2816.86]  you know
[2816.86 --> 2817.36]  sometimes I
[2817.36 --> 2817.64]  think we
[2817.64 --> 2818.18]  doubt if
[2818.18 --> 2818.76]  God actually
[2818.76 --> 2819.36]  cares about
[2819.36 --> 2819.82]  our joy
[2819.82 --> 2821.56]  but notice
[2821.56 --> 2821.84]  what it
[2821.84 --> 2822.18]  says
[2822.18 --> 2822.62]  who
[2822.62 --> 2823.44]  increased
[2823.44 --> 2823.92]  their joy
[2823.92 --> 2824.62]  did the
[2824.62 --> 2824.82]  people
[2824.82 --> 2825.20]  themselves
[2825.20 --> 2825.56]  increase
[2825.56 --> 2825.96]  their joy
[2825.96 --> 2827.48]  no
[2827.48 --> 2828.66]  you
[2828.66 --> 2829.54]  God
[2829.54 --> 2830.80]  God
[2830.80 --> 2832.00]  increased
[2832.00 --> 2832.46]  the joy
[2832.46 --> 2832.74]  of his
[2832.74 --> 2833.06]  people
[2833.06 --> 2834.08]  God
[2834.08 --> 2834.58]  cares
[2834.58 --> 2834.94]  about
[2834.94 --> 2835.54]  the joy
[2835.54 --> 2836.50]  of his
[2836.50 --> 2836.84]  people
[2836.84 --> 2838.66]  and if
[2838.66 --> 2838.92]  we can
[2838.92 --> 2839.44]  sum up
[2839.44 --> 2839.74]  what that
[2839.74 --> 2840.16]  joy is
[2840.16 --> 2840.68]  like
[2840.68 --> 2842.08]  he describes
[2842.08 --> 2842.42]  it in the
[2842.42 --> 2842.86]  next part
[2842.86 --> 2843.14]  of verse
[2843.14 --> 2843.38]  three
[2843.38 --> 2844.04]  it's like
[2844.04 --> 2844.50]  when
[2844.50 --> 2846.28]  they rejoice
[2846.28 --> 2847.10]  before you
[2847.10 --> 2847.72]  as people
[2847.72 --> 2848.36]  rejoice
[2848.36 --> 2849.14]  at the
[2849.14 --> 2849.50]  harvest
[2849.50 --> 2849.70]  right
[2849.70 --> 2850.56]  this bumper
[2850.56 --> 2850.92]  crop
[2850.92 --> 2851.84]  that leads
[2851.84 --> 2852.70]  to celebration
[2852.70 --> 2853.64]  and economic
[2853.64 --> 2854.20]  prosperity
[2854.20 --> 2854.90]  now some
[2854.90 --> 2855.28]  of you are
[2855.28 --> 2855.62]  farmers
[2855.62 --> 2856.52]  and maybe
[2856.52 --> 2857.00]  you have a
[2857.00 --> 2857.60]  sense of
[2857.60 --> 2858.46]  what Isaiah
[2858.46 --> 2858.94]  is talking
[2858.94 --> 2859.42]  about here
[2859.42 --> 2860.38]  a lot of us
[2860.38 --> 2860.66]  are not
[2860.66 --> 2860.98]  farmers
[2860.98 --> 2862.00]  so we don't
[2862.00 --> 2862.94]  really get
[2862.94 --> 2863.70]  we don't
[2863.70 --> 2864.40]  really feel
[2864.40 --> 2864.66]  right
[2864.66 --> 2865.10]  that sense
[2865.10 --> 2865.54]  of joy
[2865.54 --> 2867.28]  but maybe
[2867.28 --> 2867.84]  just imagine
[2867.84 --> 2868.42]  this imagine
[2868.42 --> 2869.02]  it's Christmas
[2869.02 --> 2870.12]  time and
[2870.12 --> 2870.66]  you just
[2870.66 --> 2871.68]  you receive
[2871.68 --> 2872.42]  somehow an
[2872.42 --> 2873.22]  unexpected
[2873.22 --> 2874.34]  windfall
[2874.34 --> 2876.10]  maybe you know
[2876.10 --> 2876.62]  it's a Christmas
[2876.62 --> 2877.04]  bonus
[2877.04 --> 2877.80]  you didn't
[2877.80 --> 2878.32]  expect it
[2878.32 --> 2878.72]  was coming
[2878.72 --> 2879.24]  and you
[2879.24 --> 2879.56]  certainly
[2879.56 --> 2880.28]  didn't expect
[2880.28 --> 2880.72]  it would
[2880.72 --> 2881.28]  be like
[2881.28 --> 2881.74]  that
[2881.74 --> 2883.28]  right
[2883.28 --> 2883.70]  that's the
[2883.70 --> 2884.36]  joy that
[2884.36 --> 2885.14]  Jesus brings
[2885.14 --> 2885.56]  to us
[2885.56 --> 2886.06]  sitting in
[2886.06 --> 2886.56]  darkness
[2886.56 --> 2887.68]  it's just
[2887.68 --> 2888.58]  this unexpected
[2888.58 --> 2890.86]  joy that
[2890.86 --> 2891.56]  comes to us
[2891.56 --> 2892.02]  and then we're
[2892.02 --> 2893.26]  given another
[2893.26 --> 2895.44]  metaphor here
[2895.44 --> 2896.28]  another image
[2896.28 --> 2896.92]  of this joy
[2896.92 --> 2897.46]  in verse
[2897.46 --> 2897.70]  three
[2897.70 --> 2899.26]  it keeps
[2899.26 --> 2899.62]  going
[2899.62 --> 2900.34]  as
[2900.34 --> 2901.46]  warriors
[2901.46 --> 2902.06]  rejoice
[2902.06 --> 2902.84]  when dividing
[2902.84 --> 2903.42]  the plunder
[2903.42 --> 2904.60]  now we can
[2904.60 --> 2905.18]  all appreciate
[2905.18 --> 2905.56]  this one
[2905.56 --> 2905.76]  right
[2905.76 --> 2907.52]  no I don't
[2907.52 --> 2907.68]  know
[2907.68 --> 2907.98]  I don't
[2907.98 --> 2908.30]  I don't
[2908.30 --> 2909.08]  think any
[2909.08 --> 2909.38]  of us
[2909.38 --> 2909.98]  really kind
[2909.98 --> 2910.18]  of
[2910.18 --> 2911.48]  experience
[2911.48 --> 2912.06]  that particular
[2912.06 --> 2912.42]  joy
[2912.42 --> 2914.60]  but maybe
[2914.60 --> 2914.96]  for you
[2914.96 --> 2915.42]  kids
[2915.42 --> 2916.82]  maybe you'll
[2916.82 --> 2917.18]  appreciate
[2917.18 --> 2917.84]  this example
[2917.84 --> 2918.54]  so a few
[2918.54 --> 2919.02]  years ago
[2919.02 --> 2919.44]  my daughter
[2919.44 --> 2919.98]  Gabby
[2919.98 --> 2920.58]  she has
[2920.58 --> 2921.04]  a friend
[2921.04 --> 2922.14]  and her
[2922.14 --> 2923.10]  friend won
[2923.10 --> 2924.42]  a contest
[2924.42 --> 2925.66]  with Toys R Us
[2925.66 --> 2927.26]  and the prize
[2927.26 --> 2927.94]  was that she
[2927.94 --> 2929.04]  got ten seconds
[2929.04 --> 2930.12]  to take a
[2930.12 --> 2930.66]  shopping car
[2930.66 --> 2931.12]  and push it
[2931.12 --> 2931.64]  down the aisle
[2931.64 --> 2932.26]  and put as
[2932.26 --> 2933.24]  many toys
[2933.24 --> 2934.06]  as she could
[2934.06 --> 2934.72]  into the
[2934.72 --> 2935.36]  shopping cart
[2935.36 --> 2937.54]  so anything
[2937.54 --> 2938.28]  that you can
[2938.28 --> 2938.98]  get into the
[2938.98 --> 2939.82]  cart is yours
[2939.82 --> 2940.68]  for free
[2940.68 --> 2942.72]  now ten seconds
[2942.72 --> 2943.82]  doesn't seem
[2943.82 --> 2944.24]  like a lot of
[2944.24 --> 2944.60]  time
[2944.60 --> 2947.00]  but if you're
[2947.00 --> 2947.44]  you know
[2947.44 --> 2948.28]  if you're
[2948.28 --> 2948.70]  into it
[2948.70 --> 2950.58]  you can end
[2950.58 --> 2951.16]  up with a

[3122.90 --> 3123.36]  risen
[3123.36 --> 3123.92]  already
[3123.92 --> 3125.12]  then
[3125.12 --> 3125.56]  why
[3125.56 --> 3125.84]  does

[3127.58 --> 3127.82]  the
[3127.82 --> 3128.12]  earth
[3128.12 --> 3129.86]  right
[3129.86 --> 3130.14]  why
[3130.14 --> 3130.74]  if

[3131.00 --> 3131.22]  is
[3131.22 --> 3131.46]  here

[3138.20 --> 3138.52]  one
[3138.52 --> 3138.68]  way

[3149.74 --> 3150.12]  is
[3150.12 --> 3150.50]  allowed
[3150.50 --> 3150.82]  in

[3156.04 --> 3156.20]  this
[3156.20 --> 3156.44]  world
[3156.44 --> 3156.62]  it
[3156.62 --> 3156.78]  does
[3156.78 --> 3157.06]  not
[3157.06 --> 3157.30]  mean
[3157.30 --> 3157.48]  that
[3157.48 --> 3157.74]  Jesus
[3157.74 --> 3157.98]  has
[3157.98 --> 3158.16]  not
[3158.16 --> 3158.52]  come
[3158.52 --> 3159.70]  it
[3159.70 --> 3159.88]  is
[3159.88 --> 3160.50]  evidence
[3160.50 --> 3160.96]  that
[3160.96 --> 3161.22]  Jesus
[3161.22 --> 3161.50]  has
[3161.50 --> 3161.86]  not
[3161.86 --> 3162.10]  been

[3164.66 --> 3165.30]  and
[3165.30 --> 3165.58]  human
[3165.58 --> 3166.02]  minds
[3166.02 --> 3167.78]  the

[3169.06 --> 3169.28]  writes
[3169.28 --> 3169.54]  about
[3169.54 --> 3169.84]  this

[3170.88 --> 3171.62]  this

[3171.76 --> 3171.88]  what
[3171.88 --> 3172.02]  we
[3172.02 --> 3172.22]  read

[3172.64 --> 3174.68]  the
[3174.68 --> 3175.06]  true
[3175.06 --> 3175.62]  light
[3175.62 --> 3175.90]  that

[3178.76 --> 3179.28]  he
[3179.28 --> 3179.48]  was

[3181.20 --> 3181.40]  was
[3181.40 --> 3181.60]  made

[3182.24 --> 3183.36]  the
[3183.36 --> 3183.74]  world
[3183.74 --> 3184.04]  did
[3184.04 --> 3184.36]  not
[3184.36 --> 3185.02]  recognize
[3185.02 --> 3185.52]  him
[3185.52 --> 3187.06]  he

[3187.50 --> 3187.68]  to
[3187.68 --> 3187.90]  that
[3187.90 --> 3188.08]  which

[3196.06 --> 3196.20]  to
[3196.20 --> 3196.52]  those
[3196.52 --> 3196.66]  who
[3196.66 --> 3197.10]  believed
[3197.10 --> 3197.30]  in
[3197.30 --> 3197.50]  his
[3197.50 --> 3197.80]  name
[3197.80 --> 3198.24]  he
[3198.24 --> 3198.60]  gave
[3198.60 --> 3198.78]  the
[3198.78 --> 3199.00]  right
[3199.00 --> 3199.18]  to
[3199.18 --> 3199.58]  become
[3199.58 --> 3199.96]  children
[3200.88 --> 3203.42]  you

[3204.02 --> 3204.46]  our
[3204.46 --> 3204.68]  first
[3204.68 --> 3205.06]  song
[3205.06 --> 3206.20]  was
[3206.20 --> 3207.40]  joy
[3207.40 --> 3208.68]  to
[3208.68 --> 3208.80]  the

[3209.02 --> 3209.26]  right
[3209.26 --> 3209.90]  remember
[3209.90 --> 3211.44]  joy
[3211.44 --> 3211.70]  to
[3211.70 --> 3211.90]  the

[3214.30 --> 3214.84]  come
[3214.84 --> 3215.56]  what's
[3215.56 --> 3215.64]  the
[3215.64 --> 3215.84]  next
[3215.84 --> 3216.16]  line

[3218.00 --> 3219.50]  receive
[3219.50 --> 3220.30]  her
[3220.30 --> 3220.86]  king

[3223.62 --> 3223.82]  do
[3223.82 --> 3224.04]  what
[3224.04 --> 3225.70]  prepare
[3225.70 --> 3226.14]  him
[3226.14 --> 3226.36]  room
[3226.36 --> 3228.32]  has
[3228.32 --> 3228.60]  earth
[3228.60 --> 3229.06]  received

[3229.54 --> 3231.40]  has
[3231.40 --> 3231.92]  every
[3231.92 --> 3232.38]  heart
[3232.38 --> 3233.22]  prepared
[3233.22 --> 3233.70]  him
[3233.70 --> 3234.04]  room
[3234.04 --> 3235.62]  has
[3235.62 --> 3235.88]  every
[3235.88 --> 3236.86]  heart
[3236.86 --> 3237.08]  in
[3237.08 --> 3237.26]  this
[3237.26 --> 3237.46]  room
[3237.46 --> 3237.86]  prepared
[3237.86 --> 3238.10]  him
[3238.10 --> 3238.34]  room
[3238.34 --> 3241.54]  right
[3241.54 --> 3241.86]  it is
[3241.86 --> 3242.14]  when
[3242.14 --> 3242.52]  and where
[3242.52 --> 3242.90]  Jesus
[3242.90 --> 3243.14]  is
[3243.14 --> 3243.48]  allowed
[3243.48 --> 3243.74]  in
[3243.74 --> 3243.90]  when
[3243.90 --> 3244.04]  he
[3244.04 --> 3244.20]  is
[3244.20 --> 3244.68]  received
[3244.68 --> 3245.02]  that
[3245.02 --> 3245.20]  the
[3245.20 --> 3245.62]  darkness
[3245.62 --> 3246.44]  begins
[3246.44 --> 3246.80]  to be
[3246.80 --> 3247.20]  pierced
[3247.20 --> 3247.56]  by the
[3247.56 --> 3247.76]  light
[3247.76 --> 3247.92]  in
[3247.92 --> 3248.18]  our
[3248.18 --> 3248.42]  own
[3248.42 --> 3248.78]  hearts
[3248.78 --> 3249.14]  and
[3249.14 --> 3249.70]  through
[3249.70 --> 3250.10]  us
[3250.10 --> 3250.48]  in
[3250.48 --> 3250.60]  the
[3250.60 --> 3250.96]  world
[3250.96 --> 3251.76]  and
[3251.76 --> 3252.26]  sorrow
[3252.26 --> 3253.02]  can be
[3253.02 --> 3253.34]  lifted
[3253.34 --> 3254.26]  and become
[3254.26 --> 3254.62]  joy
[3254.62 --> 3256.34]  so
[3256.34 --> 3256.66]  then that
[3256.66 --> 3256.92]  leads us
[3256.92 --> 3257.10]  to the
[3257.10 --> 3257.34]  question
[3257.34 --> 3257.76]  well how
[3257.76 --> 3258.24]  do we
[3258.24 --> 3258.86]  receive him
[3258.86 --> 3259.48]  how do
[3259.48 --> 3259.60]  we
[3259.60 --> 3259.90]  receive
[3259.90 --> 3260.14]  him
[3260.14 --> 3261.52]  now
[3261.52 --> 3261.92]  remember
[3261.92 --> 3262.48]  christmas
[3262.48 --> 3263.16]  is not
[3263.16 --> 3263.62]  for the
[3263.62 --> 3263.98]  people
[3263.98 --> 3264.64]  who have
[3264.64 --> 3265.28]  their lives
[3265.28 --> 3265.74]  all put
[3265.74 --> 3266.14]  together
[3266.14 --> 3267.60]  it's not
[3267.60 --> 3268.04]  for those
[3268.04 --> 3268.68]  necessarily
[3268.68 --> 3270.64]  who have
[3270.64 --> 3271.84]  the christmas card
[3271.84 --> 3272.40]  with the best
[3272.40 --> 3273.14]  family photo
[3273.14 --> 3274.62]  that would not
[3274.62 --> 3275.16]  be us
[3275.16 --> 3277.78]  not just
[3277.78 --> 3278.32]  because of me
[3278.32 --> 3279.24]  because we
[3279.24 --> 3279.56]  don't even
[3279.56 --> 3279.88]  do it
[3279.88 --> 3281.88]  it's not
[3281.88 --> 3282.62]  the family
[3282.62 --> 3283.18]  who has
[3283.18 --> 3283.60]  the most
[3283.60 --> 3284.44]  instagramable
[3284.44 --> 3285.14]  christmas tree
[3285.14 --> 3286.82]  because i
[3286.82 --> 3287.14]  picked out
[3287.14 --> 3287.46]  the tree
[3287.46 --> 3291.36]  at christmas
[3291.36 --> 3292.92]  we love
[3292.92 --> 3293.40]  to sing
[3293.40 --> 3293.98]  the carol
[3293.98 --> 3295.14]  oh come
[3295.14 --> 3295.44]  all ye
[3295.44 --> 3295.74]  faithful
[3295.74 --> 3296.02]  right
[3296.02 --> 3298.02]  well this
[3298.02 --> 3298.34]  week i
[3298.34 --> 3298.82]  came across
[3298.82 --> 3299.30]  a different
[3299.30 --> 3299.94]  version of
[3299.94 --> 3300.50]  that song
[3300.50 --> 3302.40]  oh come
[3302.40 --> 3302.92]  all ye
[3302.92 --> 3303.46]  faithless
[3303.46 --> 3304.32]  do you all
[3304.32 --> 3304.58]  know this
[3304.58 --> 3304.80]  one
[3304.80 --> 3306.30]  here's the
[3306.30 --> 3306.96]  first verse
[3306.96 --> 3309.26]  oh come
[3309.26 --> 3311.86]  all ye
[3311.86 --> 3312.46]  faithless
[3312.46 --> 3315.78]  joyless
[3315.78 --> 3316.92]  and defeated
[3316.92 --> 3318.72]  oh come
[3318.72 --> 3318.98]  me oh
[3318.98 --> 3319.14]  come
[3319.14 --> 3319.36]  me to
[3319.36 --> 3319.94]  bethlehem
[3319.94 --> 3320.68]  come and
[3320.68 --> 3321.18]  behold him
[3321.18 --> 3321.64]  hope of
[3321.64 --> 3321.90]  all the
[3321.90 --> 3322.36]  nations
[3322.36 --> 3323.94]  come let's
[3323.94 --> 3324.50]  adore him
[3324.50 --> 3326.20]  now i don't
[3326.20 --> 3326.92]  mean to ruin
[3326.92 --> 3327.54]  you know the
[3327.54 --> 3328.30]  traditional carol
[3328.30 --> 3328.68]  for you
[3328.68 --> 3329.88]  but i think it
[3329.88 --> 3330.42]  makes a good
[3330.42 --> 3331.26]  theological point
[3331.26 --> 3333.26]  if it was just
[3333.26 --> 3333.96]  oh come
[3333.96 --> 3334.40]  all ye
[3334.40 --> 3334.96]  faithful
[3334.96 --> 3336.72]  joyful
[3336.72 --> 3337.86]  triumphant
[3337.86 --> 3339.14]  right if
[3339.14 --> 3339.72]  that is who
[3339.72 --> 3340.38]  christmas was
[3340.38 --> 3340.88]  for
[3340.88 --> 3342.42]  it wouldn't
[3342.42 --> 3343.10]  be for any
[3343.10 --> 3343.64]  of us
[3343.64 --> 3346.02]  right christ
[3346.02 --> 3346.56]  coming
[3346.56 --> 3348.00]  at christmas
[3348.00 --> 3348.54]  is for
[3348.54 --> 3349.62]  the faithless
[3349.62 --> 3351.48]  the joyless
[3351.48 --> 3352.38]  and the
[3352.38 --> 3352.74]  defeated
[3352.74 --> 3354.26]  it's for those
[3354.26 --> 3355.24]  who are walking
[3355.24 --> 3355.78]  in spiritual
[3355.78 --> 3356.24]  darkness
[3356.24 --> 3357.90]  and that means
[3357.90 --> 3358.40]  it's for you
[3358.40 --> 3358.90]  and for me
[3358.90 --> 3360.48]  right jesus is
[3360.48 --> 3360.92]  a gift
[3360.92 --> 3362.46]  and like any
[3362.46 --> 3363.40]  true gift
[3363.40 --> 3364.48]  you don't have
[3364.48 --> 3365.46]  to earn it
[3365.46 --> 3366.40]  you don't have
[3366.40 --> 3367.50]  to deserve it
[3367.50 --> 3368.32]  all you have
[3368.32 --> 3368.92]  to do is open
[3368.92 --> 3369.32]  your hands
[3369.32 --> 3370.04]  and receive it
[3370.04 --> 3371.90]  so that's the
[3371.90 --> 3372.52]  first response
[3372.52 --> 3373.28]  jesus is the
[3373.28 --> 3373.72]  light what do
[3373.72 --> 3374.10]  we do when
[3374.10 --> 3374.74]  the the sun
[3374.74 --> 3375.52]  rises we've
[3375.52 --> 3375.92]  been sitting
[3375.92 --> 3376.30]  in the cold
[3376.30 --> 3376.76]  and darkness
[3376.76 --> 3378.38]  we receive it
[3378.38 --> 3379.94]  and it leads
[3379.94 --> 3380.50]  to joy
[3380.50 --> 3381.08]  it leads to
[3381.08 --> 3381.68]  gladness
[3381.68 --> 3383.28]  it's for all
[3383.28 --> 3383.80]  of us who are
[3383.80 --> 3384.36]  sitting in
[3384.36 --> 3384.72]  darkness
[3384.72 --> 3385.66]  none of us
[3385.66 --> 3386.34]  deserve the
[3386.34 --> 3386.78]  sunrise
[3386.78 --> 3388.64]  and here's the
[3388.64 --> 3389.22]  second thing
[3389.22 --> 3391.18]  if we if you
[3391.18 --> 3392.12]  receive jesus as
[3392.12 --> 3392.50]  your light
[3392.50 --> 3392.86]  right
[3392.86 --> 3394.32]  not only does
[3394.32 --> 3394.90]  he bring you
[3394.90 --> 3395.48]  this life
[3395.48 --> 3395.84]  and joy
[3395.84 --> 3396.58]  and hope
[3396.58 --> 3398.00]  he also gives
[3398.00 --> 3398.56]  you a mission
[3398.56 --> 3400.98]  jesus said
[3400.98 --> 3401.66]  that he is
[3401.66 --> 3402.08]  the light
[3402.08 --> 3402.74]  of the world
[3402.74 --> 3403.96]  that's what
[3403.96 --> 3404.46]  we celebrate
[3404.46 --> 3404.86]  that's what
[3404.86 --> 3405.46]  we rejoice
[3405.46 --> 3406.24]  in at christmas
[3406.24 --> 3407.56]  but you know
[3407.56 --> 3409.04]  what he also
[3409.04 --> 3409.66]  said the same
[3409.66 --> 3410.12]  thing about
[3410.12 --> 3410.80]  his disciples
[3410.80 --> 3413.54]  he tells us
[3413.54 --> 3414.16]  in matthew
[3414.16 --> 3415.00]  chapter 5
[3415.00 --> 3415.60]  verse 14
[3415.60 --> 3418.66]  you are
[3418.66 --> 3419.00]  the light
[3419.00 --> 3419.46]  of the world
[3419.46 --> 3421.12]  let your light
[3421.12 --> 3421.90]  shine before
[3421.90 --> 3422.52]  others that
[3422.52 --> 3423.16]  they may see
[3423.16 --> 3423.86]  your good deeds
[3423.86 --> 3424.56]  and glorify
[3424.56 --> 3425.04]  your father
[3425.04 --> 3425.56]  in heaven
[3425.56 --> 3426.90]  right when
[3426.90 --> 3427.62]  jesus shines
[3427.62 --> 3428.02]  his light
[3428.02 --> 3428.54]  upon you
[3428.54 --> 3429.40]  he makes
[3429.40 --> 3430.32]  you a little
[3430.32 --> 3430.94]  light as
[3430.94 --> 3431.26]  well
[3431.26 --> 3431.74]  right it's
[3431.74 --> 3432.12]  like those
[3432.12 --> 3432.60]  glowy
[3432.60 --> 3433.50]  stickers or
[3433.50 --> 3434.16]  stars you
[3434.16 --> 3434.48]  might put
[3434.48 --> 3434.76]  on your
[3434.76 --> 3435.60]  your ceiling
[3435.60 --> 3436.16]  as a kid
[3436.16 --> 3436.84]  right you
[3436.84 --> 3437.26]  turn on the
[3437.26 --> 3437.74]  light and it
[3437.74 --> 3438.24]  soaks up all
[3438.24 --> 3438.84]  that light
[3438.84 --> 3439.58]  then you
[3439.58 --> 3440.00]  turn off
[3440.00 --> 3440.36]  your lights
[3440.36 --> 3440.76]  at night
[3440.76 --> 3443.14]  stars are
[3443.14 --> 3443.48]  glowing
[3443.48 --> 3444.48]  right we
[3444.48 --> 3445.22]  we don't
[3445.22 --> 3445.54]  have the
[3445.54 --> 3445.72]  light in
[3445.72 --> 3446.06]  ourselves
[3446.06 --> 3446.68]  we receive
[3446.68 --> 3446.98]  it and we
[3446.98 --> 3447.76]  reflect it
[3447.76 --> 3448.56]  we reflect
[3448.56 --> 3448.94]  it back
[3448.94 --> 3449.36]  into the
[3449.36 --> 3449.70]  world
[3449.70 --> 3453.06]  so we
[3453.06 --> 3453.80]  are called
[3453.80 --> 3454.72]  also to
[3454.72 --> 3455.42]  be the
[3455.42 --> 3455.84]  light of
[3455.84 --> 3456.30]  the world
[3456.30 --> 3457.24]  to shine
[3457.24 --> 3457.96]  light
[3457.96 --> 3459.88]  in the
[3459.88 --> 3460.38]  darkness of
[3460.38 --> 3460.66]  our own
[3460.66 --> 3461.12]  lives
[3461.12 --> 3462.16]  and in the
[3462.16 --> 3462.68]  darkness of
[3462.68 --> 3463.32]  our culture
[3463.32 --> 3463.78]  and our
[3463.78 --> 3464.10]  neighborhood
[3464.10 --> 3465.64]  right not to
[3465.64 --> 3466.30]  sit back and
[3466.30 --> 3466.88]  just let the
[3466.88 --> 3467.82]  darkness spread
[3467.82 --> 3469.66]  but to shine a
[3469.66 --> 3470.42]  light on it and
[3470.42 --> 3472.20]  expose it and to
[3472.20 --> 3473.06]  bring healing where
[3473.06 --> 3474.28]  we can to shine a
[3474.28 --> 3474.78]  light where we
[3474.78 --> 3477.10]  can so here's the
[3477.10 --> 3479.72]  question who or
[3479.72 --> 3480.78]  where is God
[3480.78 --> 3482.50]  calling you to be a
[3482.50 --> 3482.88]  light in the
[3482.88 --> 3485.96]  darkness he calls
[3485.96 --> 3487.18]  each one of us in
[3487.18 --> 3488.52]  different times and
[3488.52 --> 3489.42]  places to be a
[3489.42 --> 3490.72]  light right maybe
[3490.72 --> 3491.34]  it's to be the
[3491.34 --> 3493.44]  presence of light in
[3493.44 --> 3494.70]  someone else's dark
[3494.70 --> 3495.64]  times that they are
[3495.64 --> 3497.70]  going through or
[3497.70 --> 3498.42]  maybe it's just to
[3498.42 --> 3499.62]  invite someone along to
[3499.62 --> 3500.66]  church tonight for
[3500.66 --> 3502.26]  Christmas Eve or to
[3502.26 --> 3504.10]  offer to pray for
[3504.10 --> 3506.64]  someone where is
[3506.64 --> 3507.60]  God calling you to
[3507.60 --> 3508.56]  shine light into the
[3508.56 --> 3510.74]  darkness right Jesus
[3510.74 --> 3511.62]  friends he is the
[3511.62 --> 3513.26]  light of the world he
[3513.26 --> 3514.40]  is the day spring he
[3514.40 --> 3515.60]  says the light shines
[3515.60 --> 3516.62]  in the darkness the
[3516.62 --> 3517.96]  darkness shall not
[3517.96 --> 3520.46]  overcome it even we
[3520.46 --> 3521.26]  see still all this
[3521.26 --> 3522.08]  darkness in the world
[3522.08 --> 3524.52]  eventually it will
[3524.52 --> 3525.96]  give way not because
[3525.96 --> 3526.90]  darkness naturally
[3526.90 --> 3527.78]  gives way to light but
[3527.78 --> 3528.78]  because Jesus has
[3528.78 --> 3531.32]  come and his light is
[3531.32 --> 3532.40]  continuing to spread
[3532.40 --> 3533.60]  thanks be to God
[3533.60 --> 3535.26]  let's pray would you

[3561.64 --> 3564.64]  light has shined into the
[3564.64 --> 3565.56]  darkness through the
[3565.56 --> 3566.50]  darkness through the
[3566.50 --> 3568.40]  gloom because you have

[4188.32 --> 4190.32]  And you are the one who is
[4190.32 --> 4204.32]  One note before we go before God in prayer this morning is that
[4204.32 --> 4207.32]  Hank Binbeek is not doing well apparently
[4207.32 --> 4208.32]  And he is in the hospital
[4208.32 --> 4214.32]  So we definitely want to keep Hank and his wife Liz in our prayers today and this week
[4214.32 --> 4216.32]  Please join me in prayer
[4216.32 --> 4224.32]  Heavenly Father, may this eternal truth be always on our hearts
[4224.32 --> 4250.32]  That the God who breathed this world into being, placed stars into the heavens, and designed a butterfly's wing is the God who entrusted his life to the care of ordinary people, became vulnerable that we might know how strong is the power of love. A mystery so deep it is impossible to grasp, a mystery so beautiful it is impossible to ignore.
[4250.32 --> 4278.32]  Circle us, Lord, circle us with the light of your presence, bright within this dark world. Enable us to be overcomers of fear and temptation. Enable us to be victors over sin and despair. Enable us to become that which you would desire, that the work of this church within our community shows your love, your compassion, your salvation to those around us.
[4278.32 --> 4302.32]  Circle us, Lord, circle us, circle our family within the shelter of your outstretched arms. Protect them in each moment of their daily lives. Protect them in the decisions that they face. Protect their homes and relationships and in this Christmas season be near those who feel afresh the loneliness from loss of a loved one or the difficulty of health issues preventing time with loved ones.
[4302.32 --> 4317.32]  We pray in particular for Hank. May he be healed and return from the hospital soon. We pray for healing for Tony Wynja. We pray that the fracture in his back will heal and that he can be relieved from the pain that he's in right now.
[4317.32 --> 4327.32]  We also pray for Kathy Cupidow mourning the loss of her dear uncle in Calgary. I just pray that you'll comfort her as well as she deals with this loss.
[4327.32 --> 4351.32]  Circle us, Lord, circle us, Lord. Circle this nation with Advent love and hope. Create a desire to listen to the Advent message. Create a willingness to understand and respond. Create a need to reach out to the Christ child. Equip our leaders with wisdom in the decisions they make that as a nation we reach for peace and caring.
[4351.32 --> 4359.78]  Circle us, Lord. Circle this world with the joy of your salvation. Where there is sickness and
[4359.78 --> 4365.82]  disease, bring healing. Where there is hunger and despair, bring hope. Where there is torture
[4365.82 --> 4371.94]  and oppression, bring release. And where there is war, bring peace. We pray especially for your
[4371.94 --> 4377.10]  intervention in the Middle East, where the war in Gaza continues on and threatens even to spread
[4377.10 --> 4382.86]  across the region. We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine that has raged for close to two years now.
[4383.58 --> 4388.82]  Please grant wisdom to all leaders involved in these conflicts and work in their hearts to create
[4388.82 --> 4396.06]  a desire to find peace. And as we head out on this Christmas Eve day, may you bless our gatherings
[4396.06 --> 4402.30]  with family and friends. May you keep us safe in our travels. And may we take joy in your gift of
[4402.30 --> 4407.02]  your own son, celebrate it this season. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[4407.02 --> 4408.02]  Amen.
[4409.36 --> 4423.46]  Let's pray.
[4423.46 --> 4430.16]  Just carrying through with Pastor Mason's analogy on the hilltop there for the sun.
[4430.68 --> 4443.06]  After the anticipation, during the cool, the discomfort, and the non-sleep, when the sun came up, life resumed hope.
[4443.74 --> 4450.06]  Plans for the day that could contribute to the angel of forward to, because of the life of the Lord.
[4450.06 --> 4464.16]  This song has the same message that all is well, because he has come, because he is the hope, he is the love, that all is well, and can be well in our hearts and in our eyes.
[4464.64 --> 4470.46]  Because the little child was born and the food saved the world.
[4470.46 --> 4481.70]  So, receive this song as we go out, knowing that because of this celebration, what we celebrate during this time, all can be well in our hearts.
[4481.70 --> 4483.70]  Thank you.
[4483.70 --> 4488.70]  Thank you.
[4488.70 --> 4490.70]  Thank you.
[4490.70 --> 4495.70]  Thank you.
[4495.70 --> 4497.70]  Thank you.
[4497.70 --> 4498.70]  Thank you.
[4498.70 --> 4511.70]  Thank you.
[4511.70 --> 4513.70]  Thank you.
