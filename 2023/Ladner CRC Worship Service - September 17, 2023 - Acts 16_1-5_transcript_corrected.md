[0.68 → 18.66] CAH IPS
[18.66 → 19.66] Amen.
[48.66 → 50.66] Amen.
[78.66 → 80.66] Amen.
[108.66 → 110.66] Amen.
[138.66 → 140.66] Amen.
[168.66 → 170.66] Amen.
[198.66 → 200.66] Amen.
[228.66 → 230.66] Amen.
[258.66 → 287.02] Good morning.
[287.02 → 288.02] Good morning.
[288.02 → 290.68] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[291.00 → 296.34] We gather here together this Sunday, as we do every Sunday, as a response to God's call
[296.34 → 297.34] to worship Him.
[298.16 → 302.76] My name is Ryan, and I will be helping us guide you through that worship this morning, alongside
[302.76 → 308.20] Pastor Jason, who will bring us God's word from the book of Acts, and with Mel and the
[308.20 → 312.40] whole music team, who will be helping us sing God's praise through song.
[312.40 → 319.72] Before we get started with the service, I believe we have Marian bringing us a message about hospital
[319.72 → 322.00] singing, some good news about that, actually.
[322.00 → 329.00] Good morning.
[330.32 → 337.66] I know that you have probably read your bulletin, but if you haven't, we have opportunity today
[337.66 → 344.98] to go to Mountain View to sing and bring the gospel to the people, the residents there.
[344.98 → 358.18] We have been doing that as a ministry in this church for many, many years, and that fell off during COVID because of all the stringent testing and so forth.
[358.18 → 366.28] So we're going to start up again this afternoon at 2.30, and I would like to invite any and all of you to join us and do some singing.
[367.42 → 369.22] And kids are welcome.
[369.54 → 371.74] The residents always love to see kids as well.
[371.90 → 375.26] So please join us if you would like and if you are able.
[375.52 → 375.94] Thank you.
[382.26 → 382.92] Thanks, Marian.
[383.00 → 386.38] It's wonderful that that's back in the full swing of things.
[386.38 → 395.08] So I know our calendars usually tell us that January 1st is the start of the year, but for kids and parents and teachers and anybody involved in church ministry,
[395.58 → 399.26] early September probably has the better claim to a start of the year feel.
[399.84 → 404.36] So for kicking things off this year, we're actually going to be having a barbecue after this service.
[404.66 → 409.06] So we read about believers sharing meals throughout the Old and the New Testament.
[409.40 → 414.48] It's reflected in the sacraments, and it's simply just a great way to get to know each other better.
[414.48 → 423.44] So I'd like to invite everybody, members, visitors, friends, everybody, to stay after the service and enjoy a meal with glad and generous hearts.
[423.96 → 429.26] So in that spirit, let's stand as we turn to the worship of our Creator, from whom all these blessings flow.
[429.26 → 432.26] Let's read.
[432.26 → 435.30] My heart, O God, is steadfast.
[436.10 → 439.76] I will sing and make music with all my soul.
[440.24 → 442.00] Awake, harp and lyre.
[442.62 → 447.90] I will praise you, Lord, among the nations.
[448.44 → 451.16] I will sing with you among the peoples.
[451.76 → 454.48] For great is your love, higher than the heavens.
[454.48 → 469.62] be exalted oh god above the heavens let us pray heavenly father we praise your holy name
[469.62 → 474.48] you are with us when we lie at night and with us when we rise in the morning
[474.48 → 480.08] you perceive our thoughts from afar and before a word is on our tongue you know it completely
[480.08 → 488.26] you chose us before the world was made to be your holy people through Christ's blood you have set us
[488.26 → 495.06] free and cleansed us of all of our sins may we worship your this you this morning and also be
[495.06 → 503.06] made perfect through Christ amen our heavenly father has called us to worship and now greets us
[503.06 → 509.50] grace mercy and peace be with us from god the father and from Jesus Christ the father son in truth and
[509.50 → 512.76] in love as god has greeted us let us now greet one another
[512.76 → 516.76] so
[516.76 → 518.76] so
[518.76 → 522.76] so
[522.76 → 526.76] so
[526.76 → 528.76] so
[528.76 → 530.76] so
[530.76 → 534.76] so
[534.76 → 536.76] so
[536.76 → 538.76] so
[539.50 → 542.76] so
[542.76 → 544.76] so
[544.76 → 548.76] so
[548.76 → 550.76] so
[550.76 → 554.76] so
[554.76 → 560.76] so
[560.76 → 564.76] so
[564.76 → 569.32] so
[578.02 → 592.02] moment
[592.02 → 594.02] we
[594.02 → 610.42] Let us come before him now, and with songs his praises singing, joyful in his presence
[610.42 → 612.42] above.
[614.42 → 624.42] Over our great and garden glorious is the Lord of whom we sing.
[624.42 → 634.42] Over our idol, God's victorious, great is he our God and King.
[634.42 → 645.42] In his hands are earthly placements, also he's for all the hills.
[645.42 → 657.42] Is the sea whose bounty traces, is the man whose bounty fails.
[657.42 → 670.42] To the Lord such mighty healing, let us come with reverence meet.
[670.42 → 681.42] And before our finger be laid, let us worship at his feet.
[681.42 → 692.42] He is our own God who leads us, with the people of his care.
[692.42 → 704.42] With a shepherd and he feeds us, as his flock in castors play.
[704.42 → 723.42] The people of the risen King were delighted to bring him praise.
[723.42 → 743.42] Come all and tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[743.42 → 753.42] From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to him.
[753.42 → 763.42] Where steady arms of mercy reach, to gather children in.
[763.42 → 764.42] Lord God's voice, to gather children in.
[764.42 → 765.42] Let us worship at his feet.
[765.42 → 773.42] Rejoice, rejoice, let every child rejoice.
[773.42 → 777.42] One heart, one heart, one heart.
[777.42 → 784.42] O church of friends, rejoice.
[784.42 → 786.42] Come all enjoy the joy of his morning sun.
[786.42 → 787.42] And those reaping through the night.
[787.42 → 794.42] Come those who tell of battles won, and those struggling in the fire.
[794.42 → 805.42] Come those who look in the fire.
[805.42 → 814.30] Perfect love will never change, and His mercy never cease.
[814.30 → 824.22] I follow us through all our days, with His little hope appears.
[825.50 → 833.74] Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every (young) rejoice!
[833.74 → 843.74] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, Rejoice!
[845.74 → 855.74] Come young and old from every land, Men and women of the day.
[855.74 → 865.74] Come those with full of empty hands, Find the riches of His grace.
[865.74 → 875.74] Over all the world, His people say, Sure to show, we hear them call.
[875.74 → 885.74] The truth that bides through every age, Our God is all in all.
[885.74 → 895.74] Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every (young) rejoice!
[895.74 → 903.74] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, Rejoice!
[903.74 → 905.74] You may be seated.
[905.74 → 907.74] So this is the first time of every day.
[907.74 → 909.74] Let every (young) rejoice!
[909.74 → 911.74] Let every (young) rejoice!
[911.74 → 923.74] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, Rejoice!
[923.74 → 931.74] Let every (young) rejoice!
[931.74 → 933.74] You may be seated.
[933.74 → 943.74] So this is not in your order of worship, but I would like to just read a passage of scripture.
[943.74 → 944.74] This is not in your heart.
[944.74 → 949.74] The first time you see on the screen, Philippians 2, verses 1-11.
[949.74 → 950.74] i.
[950.74 → 951.74] 2-11.
[951.74 → 960.74] Therefore, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, If any comfort from His love,
[960.74 → 970.74] If any common sharing in the Spirit, If any tenderness and compassion, Then make my joy complete by being like-minded,
[970.74 → 978.74] Having the same love, Being one in Spirit and of mind, Do nothing out of selfish ambition,
[978.74 → 986.78] or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your
[986.78 → 993.36] own interests, but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with
[993.36 → 1000.66] one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus, who being in the very nature God, did
[1000.66 → 1009.36] not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage. Rather, he made
[1009.36 → 1015.86] himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness,
[1016.44 → 1022.40] and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,
[1022.40 → 1030.54] even death on a cross. Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the
[1030.54 → 1037.90] name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven
[1037.90 → 1043.88] and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
[1044.52 → 1050.62] to the glory of God the Father. Please remain sitting and we'll sing our next song together.
[1060.54 → 1090.52] I have a maker. He formed my heart. Before even time began, my life was in his hand. He knows that Jesus Christ is a
[1090.52 → 1108.52] God of God. He knows my name. Furthermore, he knows my name. Furthermore, he knows my every thought. Furthermore, he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call.
[1108.52 → 1129.52] I have a father. He calls me his phone. He calls me his phone. Furthermore, he'll never leave me, no matter where I go.
[1129.52 → 1150.52] He knows my name. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. Furthermore, he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call.
[1150.52 → 1180.50] He hears me when I call. He hears me when I call. He hears me when I call.
[1180.50 → 1182.36] He hears me when I come.
[1189.74 → 1203.82] As we read in 1 John, God is light. In him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.
[1203.82 → 1212.26] If we claim to be one of our sins, we deceive ourselves and live in the Lord.
[1212.98 → 1223.56] If we claim to be one of our sins, we give the people and love, and we will reveal our sins, and we will reveal our sins.
[1224.56 → 1233.80] If we claim to be one of our sins, we make the power to be one of our sins.
[1233.80 → 1236.44] Let us come before our loving Father in prayer.
[1237.82 → 1241.58] Lord Jesus, thank you for gathering us together today.
[1242.44 → 1249.96] Our offering this morning to you is nothing less than a full confession of our sins laid bare before you.
[1250.70 → 1255.50] We are a broken people, Lord, desperate and in need of your redemption.
[1256.18 → 1257.90] We pine for your mercy.
[1258.40 → 1262.28] We cannot do but one good deed without it.
[1262.28 → 1264.44] Forgive us.
[1266.62 → 1272.52] May the words of our lips be transformed by your grace and rise up to heaven like incense.
[1273.32 → 1275.66] In your name alone, we pray.
[1276.54 → 1276.86] Amen.
[1276.86 → 1282.34] If you, Lord, kept the record of sins, who could stand?
[1283.08 → 1287.74] But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
[1288.06 → 1289.54] I wait for the Lord.
[1289.76 → 1291.28] My whole being waits.
[1291.70 → 1293.80] And his word I put my hope.
[1294.38 → 1295.62] I wait for the Lord.
[1295.72 → 1297.52] More than watchmen wait for mourning.
[1298.28 → 1300.94] More than watchmen wait for mourning.
[1300.94 → 1308.18] Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption.
[1308.86 → 1312.36] He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[1313.20 → 1317.94] Let us sing of this deep love together in worship of God.
[1317.94 → 1318.94] Amen.
[1318.94 → 1319.94] Amen.
[1319.94 → 1320.94] Stand.
[1320.94 → 1321.94] Amen.
[1321.94 → 1322.94] Amen.
[1322.94 → 1323.94] Stand.
[1323.94 → 1324.94] Amen.
[1324.94 → 1325.94] Stand.
[1325.94 → 1326.94] Amen.
[1326.94 → 1327.94] Amen.
[1327.94 → 1328.94] Stand.
[1328.94 → 1329.94] Amen.
[1329.94 → 1330.94] Amen.
[1330.94 → 1331.94] Amen.
[1331.94 → 1332.94] Amen.
[1332.94 → 1334.94] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1334.94 → 1351.94] that's a measure of wisdom's dream.
[1351.94 → 1365.94] Holy, holy, holy, holy ocean, in its fullness of your belief.
[1365.94 → 1380.94] I will lead me all around me, in the pure way of my love.
[1380.94 → 1395.94] Leading over, leading over, to thy glorious best of love.
[1395.94 → 1412.94] Lord, the heavenly, heavenly, heavenly love of Jesus, spread his wisdom, shore to shore.
[1412.94 → 1427.58] How He loves us, ever loves us, changes ever, evermore.
[1427.58 → 1442.70] How He watches for grace of God, dying to call them of His own.
[1442.94 → 1457.94] How for every danger seen, watching over them from the throne.
[1457.94 → 1459.94] How He loves us, evermore.
[1459.94 → 1461.94] How He loves us, evermore.
[1461.94 → 1475.78] O the healing blood of Jesus, of the Mary of the West.
[1475.78 → 1482.78] This the night of the ocean, that's not mercy.
[1483.98 → 1491.12] This the day that you sing our prayers.
[1491.12 → 1498.12] O the healing blood of Jesus.
[1498.12 → 1506.12] This the night that was ever to be.
[1506.12 → 1514.12] When it lifts me up to glory.
[1514.12 → 1522.12] For it lifts me up to me.
[1522.12 → 1538.12] Before the kids head off to class, I'd like to take a moment this morning, especially,
[1538.12 → 1543.12] as we come into early September, that the morning, or sorry, that to thank the Kids Life teachers
[1543.12 → 1544.12] and volunteers.
[1544.12 → 1550.12] I know my daughter, Annika, loves kids life and looks forward to every Sunday to the lessons
[1550.12 → 1551.12] and crafts that you do.
[1551.12 → 1554.12] And in doing so, she grows in the knowledge of God.
[1554.12 → 1558.12] And I know that getting all the materials prepared and ensuring that teachers are there
[1558.12 → 1562.12] every Sunday, even through the summer, is a huge amount of work.
[1562.12 → 1564.12] But it really doesn't go unnoticed.
[1564.12 → 1566.12] So thank you for all you do.
[1566.12 → 1570.12] And to the kids, thank you for sitting patiently this far.
[1570.12 → 1576.12] And now you can go and enjoy worship together with your teacher in your own special way.
[1580.12 → 1585.12] And at this point, I'd like to invite Pastor Jason up to bring us God's Word.
[1585.12 → 1592.12] He's your father's good.
[1594.12 → 1597.12] My daughter, Gabby, just as she left said, it's my last year.
[1597.12 → 1600.12] She's in grade five, so yes.
[1600.12 → 1606.12] She's not necessarily looking forward to aging out of Sunday school.
[1606.12 → 1614.12] So please, would you turn with me in your Bibles,
[1614.12 → 1622.20] with me in your Bibles to the book of Acts, and we will be in chapter 16 that is on page 824
[1622.20 → 1629.52] in your pew Bibles page 824, and we are continuing our sermon series in the book of Acts
[1629.52 → 1636.78] this morning we will be reading Acts 14 verses 1 through 5.
[1636.78 → 1644.82] Please give your attention sorry Acts 16 1 to 5 I don't know what he said okay let's give our
[1644.82 → 1653.12] attention to the reading of God's word Paul came to Derby and then to Lustra where a disciple named
[1653.12 → 1660.30] Timothy lived whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek the believers
[1660.30 → 1667.36] at Lustra and Iconium spoke well of him Paul wanted to take him along on the journey so he
[1667.36 → 1673.74] circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area for they all knew that his father was a
[1673.74 → 1680.10] Greek as they travelled from town to town they delivered the decisions reached by the Apostles
[1680.10 → 1686.40] and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey, so the churches were strengthened in the faith
[1686.40 → 1695.16] and grew daily in numbers this is the word of the Lord so let's pray now and ask for God's blessing
[1695.16 → 1706.62] upon us as we open his word together let's pray our father we thank you for the many wonderful blessings
[1706.62 → 1714.54] that we have in Christ Jesus and particularly Lord we thank you that the Spirit has given us ears to hear
[1714.54 → 1721.42] and the ears to respond to your word, and so we ask now Lord that by your Spirit that you would work in
[1721.42 → 1730.74] us that we might hear and in hearing believe and in believing grow up to maturity in the knowledge
[1730.74 → 1739.92] of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and we pray in his name amen so as many of you will know because I've shared this
[1739.92 → 1745.80] before my family and I were missionaries in Taiwan for nine years, and after we left the mission field
[1745.80 → 1754.56] we came back to North America our home church sent us to a sort of retreat for missionaries who were
[1754.56 → 1762.60] coming off the field it was in Colorado it was beautiful it's this beautiful lodge, and we gathered
[1762.60 → 1767.58] with missionaries from other mission agencies from around the world, and we were together for a week
[1767.58 → 1775.64] and the program was just excused me the program was designed to help us debrief to kind of process
[1775.64 → 1783.24] through our experience of being on the field and transitioning back to life in North America one of
[1783.24 → 1792.42] the first things they talked about is how much life is filled with paradox how much life is filled with
[1792.42 → 1804.42] paradox that's true of everyone of course everyone experiences this but missionary life brings out paradox in a much more dramatic way so let me give you an example
[1804.42 → 1814.42] a missionary might reflect on their time overseas and say these two things so put them on the screen they might say on the one hand I wish we had never gone to India
[1814.42 → 1829.44] and they will say we saw God work in amazing powerful ways now those two things might seem to be contradictory like you know if you wish you had never gone
[1829.44 → 1831.42] perhaps everything was just terrible and negative but no actually both of those things can be true I can on the one hand say I wish I'd never gone it was so hard on the other hand we saw God do amazing things God changed me I grew my life, but I would say I am not so hard on the other hand I wish I had ever gone to India
[1831.42 → 1837.72] and negative but no actually both of those things can be true I can on the
[1837.72 → 1841.18] one hand say I wish I'd never gone it was so hard on the other hand we saw God
[1841.18 → 1846.96] do amazing things God changed me I grew in my faith and so both of the pain that
[1846.96 → 1851.64] in the difficulties of leaving home and living in another country like India is
[1851.64 → 1857.74] true and the joy of seeing God at work is true and that's what a paradox is
[1857.74 → 1863.14] right seemingly contradictory things, but both are true and both of those things
[1863.14 → 1868.96] can live in the same heart at the same time and at this retreat they also had a
[1868.96 → 1874.78] program for kids, and they wanted to help kids be able to recognize this idea of
[1874.78 → 1881.26] paradox the paradoxes of life, and they introduced us to yay duck and yuck duck
[1881.26 → 1885.98] let me introduce you to them there they are so we did a little photo shoot this
[1885.98 → 1893.90] morning me and the ducks right outside, so paradox is a pair of ducks get it
[1893.90 → 1901.40] right so it's so cute and funny so you have a yuck duck and a yay duck right
[1901.40 → 1905.36] they're both ducks one's kind of yucky one's good, but they're you know it's a
[1905.36 → 1910.88] pair of ducks and so as a family we've started to adopt this language of yuck
[1910.88 → 1914.06] duck and yay duck so even like we're having dinner as a family we might say
[1914.06 → 1918.86] how's your day going how what was your yay duck what was your yuck duck, so I
[1918.86 → 1924.56] invite you to also adopt this well the reason I'm talking about this is that
[1924.56 → 1929.00] just as there are paradoxes that we all experience in life in our passage this
[1929.00 → 1934.90] morning we find one of the central paradoxes of the Christian life and the
[1934.90 → 1939.62] paradox we find here is that in the Christian life we are as Christians the
[1939.62 → 1944.90] most free of all people right Christians are the most free of all people and yet
[1944.90 → 1953.48] we can make ourselves servants of all okays not only servants of Christ but also
[1953.48 → 1958.58] servants of others we are willing to give up things for the sake of others and
[1958.58 → 1964.94] this is a remarkable thing friends this is a remarkable thing how we can be free in
[1964.94 → 1969.74] the gospel how we can be free through Jesus Christ we're not bound by anything
[1969.74 → 1976.28] or anybody and yet for the sake of others we are bound Martin Luther famously wrote
[1976.28 → 1981.38] much about the paradox of Christian Liberty he called it and here's a well-known
[1981.38 → 1988.00] quote something he said a Christian is the most free Lord of all and
[1988.00 → 1995.28] subject to none a Christian is the most dutiful servant of all and subject to
[1995.28 → 2002.28] everyone paradox so there they seem maybe contradictory but no they're both true
[2002.28 → 2009.36] and this is the paradox of the Christian life the Christian is truly free and a
[2009.36 → 2017.16] servant of all and so this morning I want us to look at our passage in Acts and
[2017.16 → 2022.02] explore this together this is paradox of the Christian life and see what our
[2022.02 → 2028.14] passage can teach us about this then we will consider some points of application
[2028.14 → 2034.44] so first let's look at this passage what is going on historically contextually here
[2034.44 → 2041.42] in Acts 16 well if you remember from last week Paul and Barnabas the missionary
[2041.42 → 2049.94] team the dream team they have broken up so Paul and Barnabas they leave they sail away
[2049.94 → 2057.02] from each other Barnabas takes John Mark, and they go to the island of Cyprus whereas Paul
[2057.02 → 2061.76] takes Silas and they go off on what is known as Paul's second missionary journey we
[2061.76 → 2065.60] spent the last couple of weeks early in the summer looking at the first missionary
[2065.60 → 2071.18] journey so while Paul is it now in Lustra and remember on his first journey had gone the Lustra
[2071.18 → 2077.78] preached the gospel now he is going back, and he's visiting all of these new churches that have grown up
[2077.78 → 2085.52] because of the gospel proclamation and so now we have a new guy coming on the scene who we'd meet is a
[2085.52 → 2095.58] young man named Timothy now this is the first time in the New Testament that we meet Timothy and as you know there are two letters in the New Testament 1 Timothy 6.
[2095.58 → 2125.56] 2 Timothy he's a major guy this is the first time we meet him Acts 16. Now what do we know about Timothy comes from a very good family his mother Eunice and his grandmother Lois who we learn about in 2 Timothy were likely converted on Paul's first missionary journey Philippa right these were God-fearing Jewish women, but Paul would have gone there he would have preached the gospel to them that Jesus was going to be a good
[2125.56 → 2142.56] Jesus is the Messiah that we are saved through faith in Jesus and so Timothy's mother and grandmother they embrace the gospel, and they believe and friends Timothy was raised in that household right he has taught the faith from a young age
[2142.56 → 2172.54] So that's part of Timothy now another thing we know is that Timothy is well-spoken of by all the believers there he has a good reputation right he's kind of a's a good boy so it's not just that Paul likes him, but there's also this reputation that Timothy has right he's its a good one, so Paul says hey let's bring this guy along right he's learned the scriptures from a young age it's like he seems like he's called to be the
[2172.56 → 2195.56] ministry others are affirming of his character let's bring him along he can help us he's perfect, so Paul goes to Timothy and asks him hey Timothy would you like to come along on this missionary journey we're going to go we're going to proclaim the gospel would you join us Timothy it would seem says yes that sounds awesome sign me up
[2195.56 → 2200.56] but Paul then says okay well I will have to circumcise you wait what hold on Timothy at this point is probably raising his eyebrows, and he's asking is this really necessary I mean okay on the one hand no grown man ever wants to hear the words it is time to circumcise you have to go under the knife
[2200.56 → 2230.54] that's just not something anybody wants to hear the situation is awkward for another reason to say okay well I will have to circumcise you wait what hold on hold on Timothy at this point is probably raising his eyebrows, and he's asking is this really necessary I mean okay on the one hand no grown man ever wants to hear the words it is time to circumcise you have to go under the knife that's just not something anybody wants to hear the situation is awkward for another reason
[2230.54 → 2260.52] though as well so look at with me in verse 4 it says this as they travelled from town to town they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey what was the decision reached in Jerusalem if you remember back in Acts 15 they're at the council of Jerusalem they're all gathered and the leaders of the church decide no Gentiles do not have to be circumcised
[2260.54 → 2290.52] circumcised in order to be believers in order to be counted as the people of God so now Paul and Barnabas are sent out to go and visit all the churches and deliver the news to the churches and the end it says they hear the news they rejoice yes we're on board the gospel is that we are saved by faith alone and so you Gentiles you are welcome into the church through faith in Jesus without being circumcised as you are whatever your culture is
[2290.54 → 2320.54] you can be the people of God okay so now just a few verses later Paul has left the council in Jerusalem, and it's as though the very first thing he does is he goes and circumcises someone like what on earth is that about right why would this happen why would he do this did he forget like what they just talked about the answer in one respect is very simple
[2320.54 → 2350.54] 
[2350.54 → 2356.56] he's a Gentile, he's Greek, his father would not have circumcised him because his father would not
[2356.56 → 2362.92] have wanted to identify with the Jewish religion. And so Timothy, though he was raised by a Jewish
[2362.92 → 2368.70] mother, he grew up being taught the scriptures from a young age, he didn't have the sign of the
[2368.70 → 2377.14] covenant. He was not circumcised. Okay, so what? Why is this a problem? It's a problem because
[2377.14 → 2384.58] if Timothy is going to minister with Paul to Jewish people, and it is widely known for a fact
[2384.58 → 2390.70] in the area, remember he has this reputation, it's known that his father was Greek. He would be
[2390.70 → 2398.08] considered, therefore, to the Jewish believers as a pagan, not following the law, and they would not
[2398.08 → 2405.70] be able to hear the gospel and receive his ministry. That's the key. Because his father is a Greek,
[2405.70 → 2413.30] Greek, and they're trying to share the gospel with the Jews, they, knowing he was not circumcised,
[2413.42 → 2418.34] it would hinder the gospel. They would be confused. It would raise up so many questions,
[2418.70 → 2423.80] and they wouldn't be able to receive his ministry. That's why Paul says, Timothy, buddy,
[2424.44 → 2431.30] if you want to join me on this mission, I have to circumcise you. And what does Timothy say?
[2431.30 → 2443.18] Okay. Okay. Timothy cares more about the proclamation of the gospel. Timothy cares more about the salvation
[2443.18 → 2450.96] of sinners than he does for himself. Now, if this was a matter of Paul saying to Timothy, look,
[2451.12 → 2458.34] you need to do this in order to please God, or in order to be justified right before God,
[2458.34 → 2467.26] no, Paul would have never allowed it. And that is why, in the case of Titus, we read about in Galatians
[2467.26 → 2479.06] chapter 2, he does not allow Titus to be circumcised. Okay. So, here's the story. Paul had gone to
[2479.06 → 2488.18] Jerusalem, and some of the Jews in Jerusalem were pressuring Titus to be circumcised. Now, Titus was a full
[2488.18 → 2493.52] Gentile. Both parents were Greek, but they wanted him to be circumcised. So, they were saying, Titus,
[2493.60 → 2501.48] it is not enough simply to believe in Jesus. But you have to believe in Jesus, and you better go
[2501.48 → 2507.58] and get circumcised according to the law of Moses, and then we will welcome you. And Paul says to these
[2507.58 → 2514.32] leaders in Jerusalem, if that is how you view it, like, you've abandoned the gospel. You are adding
[2514.32 → 2519.58] something to the gospel. You're saying that it is the gospel, faith in Jesus, and circumcision,
[2519.58 → 2525.20] is what makes you a Christian. And Paul's like, forget it. That is not the gospel. Paul says,
[2525.48 → 2530.46] we've resisted them. He makes a scene about it. He says, you know, you guys who want to,
[2530.58 → 2536.72] you love the circumcision so much, I wish you would just go all the way. He says that, Galatians.
[2536.72 → 2545.74] He says, Titus, if you let yourselves be circumcised, the good news of Jesus is going to be undermined.
[2546.82 → 2551.92] Okay, but in Timothy's case, it's different. Paul's not just being inconsistent, it's different.
[2552.62 → 2558.84] They're going to visit Jewish churches. Timothy was Jewish, and his not being circumcised
[2558.84 → 2567.00] is just going to be complicated. It could hinder the gospel. The point here, friends, is that Paul
[2567.00 → 2574.42] would do anything to make it clear that it is the gospel alone which saves. And at the same time,
[2574.48 → 2581.52] he would do anything to prevent putting a stumbling block in people's way. So Paul, writing in 1 Corinthians
[2581.52 → 2589.78] 9, he makes this very point. Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave
[2589.78 → 2596.50] to everyone. Okay, and friends, here it is, right? This is the paradox of the Christian life.
[2597.36 → 2604.14] We are the most free of human beings. We have been justified by grace. The dominion of sin in our lives
[2604.14 → 2611.34] has been broken. Our salvation is secure. God loves us. You are his child. We are free. We are loved by
[2611.34 → 2625.10] God in Christ. And in our freedom, we make ourselves slaves. Why? Why? Paul continues in verse 19.
[2625.78 → 2632.48] He says this, though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone. Why?
[2633.38 → 2641.06] To win as many as possible. So here's the paradox of the Christian faith that we're talking about.
[2641.06 → 2647.92] Recognizing, first, how free you really are. So that you can then actually be the greatest
[2647.92 → 2655.70] servant of all. And that's something, friends, that we have to wrestle with. We have to learn
[2655.70 → 2663.22] how to live out in our lives, throughout our lives. What it means to be truly free. We struggle with that.
[2663.22 → 2672.08] What does it mean that we are truly free, and yet to submit ourselves to one another,
[2672.58 → 2678.80] to serve one another, and for the sake of the gospel? And we struggle with that. But this is what
[2678.80 → 2685.48] we are. This is our identity. We are truly free, and we are called, because of that, to serve others.
[2685.48 → 2692.20] And you know what? Christian missionaries do this all the time. You know, in some countries of the world,
[2693.22 → 2701.64] wives will have to walk behind their husbands. So if you're a missionary couple, and you're living
[2701.64 → 2707.78] in a country where the wives walk behind their husbands, what do you do? Do you walk down the
[2707.78 → 2716.34] street holding hands? No, because no one would talk to you. It is such a cultural taboo that that would
[2716.34 → 2723.32] hinder the sharing of the gospel. So the missionaries, they will follow the local custom, not because they
[2723.32 → 2730.84] feel like they have to. In fact, they are so free, they know they don't have to, but they are willing to do it
[2730.84 → 2738.86] out of love. Right? To remove a stumbling block in order to gain access to speak to people
[2738.86 → 2746.20] about Jesus. Right? And that's why Timothy agrees to circumcision. He was free in the gospel, right?
[2746.24 → 2752.16] He could choose to be circumcised, maybe as a way to, you know, closely identify with his Jewish heritage,
[2753.06 → 2760.42] or he could choose not to be circumcised. It doesn't matter. He was free to do either. But he
[2760.42 → 2766.54] chose to be circumcised in order that his fellow Jews would be able to hear the gospel clearly without
[2766.54 → 2774.22] it being a hindrance. And what ends up happening? We see that here in verse 5. What happens is God
[2774.22 → 2781.24] blesses the mission. So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. Right? Which
[2781.24 → 2787.60] is to say that Paul and Timothy's decision was blessed by God, and it proved to be effective for the cause of
[2787.60 → 2795.02] the gospel. Okay, so that's what's going on in this passage. Now let's talk about some application,
[2795.38 → 2802.54] and I just want to make two points here. The first is, we don't want to add anything to the gospel.
[2803.52 → 2809.42] Okay, we don't want to add anything to the gospel. What do I mean by that? I mean that we need to be
[2809.42 → 2816.30] aware that some churches, some groups of Christians, add things to the gospel. And this could undermine
[2816.30 → 2823.46] the gospel of justification by faith. So for example, some people might say this, if you are a Christian,
[2823.94 → 2834.40] you can't play cards. Unless of course it's Dutch Blitz. Or if you are a Christian, you can drink alcohol.
[2835.12 → 2839.12] Right? There are some churches around the world that make alcohol like this huge litmus test.
[2839.12 → 2846.48] It's like if you drink alcohol at all, you are not a Christian. Right? And so these are issues that for
[2846.48 → 2852.68] you and me, we may feel that between us and God, they're not matters that the Bible forbids, or they
[2852.68 → 2858.70] are not sin issues, but they are things that some people will look down on, or think that Christians
[2858.70 → 2866.82] shouldn't do, maybe for cultural reasons. But friends, any time that we add to faith in Jesus in order to be
[2866.82 → 2871.38] saved, or in order to feel that we are true Christians, that actually undermines the gospel
[2871.38 → 2878.88] itself. One of the most famous examples of this is Charles Spurgeon. He was a preacher, one of the
[2878.88 → 2886.54] first megachurch preachers, and he was a bit of a rascal, a bit of a naughty character. And he was a Baptist
[2886.54 → 2896.26] who smoked cigars. Can you believe it? And this caused a bit of an uproar. And Spurgeon was always
[2896.26 → 2904.02] very clear. He was never addicted to his cigars, but he loved them. And there are many, many antidotes
[2904.02 → 2910.26] about Spurgeon and his smoking cigars. Someone once said to him, Spurgeon, you smoke. Do you think this
[2910.26 → 2918.02] is a problem? He said, I do not think it is a problem, as long as I don't do it in excess. You know,
[2918.02 → 2925.56] and so they said, well, okay, that makes sense. So how would you define in excess? And Spurgeon replied, well,
[2926.38 → 2935.34] smoking two cigars at once. Maybe that's a little excess. But, you know, there was another occasion on a
[2935.34 → 2942.10] Sunday morning where there was, in his church, there's a visiting preacher. And as was the practice of the day,
[2942.10 → 2947.94] sometimes Spurgeon would invite the visiting preacher to kind of get up after the sermon
[2947.94 → 2955.52] and give a kind of response, an exhortation to the congregation. So on one Sunday, a preacher named
[2955.52 → 2961.44] Dr. Pentecost came from America. That is actually his name, Dr. Pentecost. You can't make this stuff up.
[2961.96 → 2967.82] So Dr. Pentecost. And Spurgeon, in his sermon, he was talking about how, you know, Christians,
[2967.82 → 2975.46] we must put sin to death, okay? We must put sin to death in our lives. And Dr. Pentecost, he got up to share
[2975.46 → 2983.66] his response. And he began talking about smoking as the example of putting all sin to death. And his message
[2983.66 → 2990.72] was essentially, if you smoke at all, especially cigars, that is a sign that you are not a Christian.
[2992.20 → 2997.68] In a sense, what is he doing is he's adding to the gospel. He's saying it's not sufficient just
[2997.68 → 3004.68] to trust in Christ for salvation. You also can't have the appearance of doing anything even slightly
[3004.68 → 3014.72] wrong. And Spurgeon was obviously in a tricky situation. He is famous for smoking cigars. So
[3014.72 → 3020.98] he decided he has to stand up after, and he's actually going to have to correct this guy in
[3020.98 → 3025.78] front of his whole church. This is a very awkward situation. And this is what Spurgeon, in his wonderful
[3025.78 → 3036.90] way, said. He said, what is for some, okay, sorry, start over. What for some is sin, others do for the glory
[3036.90 → 3043.98] of God. And before I go to bed tonight, I intend to smoke a good cigar for the glory of God.
[3043.98 → 3056.10] God. It is like incense floating up to heaven. And the point is sometimes the gospel is in danger,
[3056.90 → 3065.58] or it's in danger of being hindered, or undermined, contradicted, not because we are sinning, but
[3065.58 → 3071.80] actually because we're adding to the gospel. And if we say, well, we need faith in Christ and what he has
[3071.80 → 3077.18] done for us on the cross, and something else. If there's ever an and, what you're saying is actually,
[3077.28 → 3083.92] no, Jesus's death on the cross was not enough. We have to do this and this as well. Circumcision was
[3083.92 → 3092.78] the big issue of the day, but we do this as well. That is why Paul refused to circumcise Titus,
[3093.22 → 3098.66] because it would hinder the clear proclamation of the gospel, that it is only through faith in Christ
[3098.66 → 3104.94] that we are the people of God. And we need to be aware of this as well, right? Whenever we make
[3104.94 → 3111.12] anything a necessity for salvation, in addition to faith in Christ, we are in danger of adding to the
[3111.12 → 3117.98] gospel, and then actually the gospel plus anything equals nothing. Religion, or just not Christianity.
[3119.16 → 3122.68] Okay, now that's the first point. The second thing I want us to consider here
[3122.68 → 3130.30] is that God is always concerned with our motives, and our motive is always
[3130.30 → 3138.14] the love of Christ. What do I mean by that? I mean, if you look at Paul and Timothy's decision
[3138.14 → 3145.08] for Timothy to be circumcised, the issue is not circumcision, right? It's not the outward form.
[3145.14 → 3151.84] It's not actually the circumcision that's the issue. It's the motive. Was Timothy doing this for his own
[3151.84 → 3158.02] sake? Was Paul doing this for his own sake, or was it for the sake of Christ and for others?
[3158.36 → 3165.24] That's the issue. And that really is something that is highlighted in Timothy's life. Paul wrote in
[3165.24 → 3170.08] Philippians chapter 2 a rather remarkable reference letter. Don't you love to get reference letters?
[3170.62 → 3175.82] Or isn't it really nice when someone says something nice about you, right? That's nice.
[3175.82 → 3182.76] Now notice what Paul says about Timothy. So Timothy, Philippians chapter 2 verse 19 to 21.
[3184.18 → 3191.44] Paul writes, I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you, that I also may be cheered when I
[3191.44 → 3199.16] receive news about you. I have no one else like him who will show genuine concern for your welfare.
[3199.16 → 3207.32] For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. So notice what Paul says
[3207.32 → 3212.02] there. For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. Right?
[3212.18 → 3219.24] Timothy was willing to be circumcised. He was willing to travel with Paul and Silas to places where there
[3219.24 → 3226.52] was great persecution, there was great danger. Why? Because he was concerned about the interests,
[3226.52 → 3235.84] first and foremost, of Jesus Christ, not his own interests. And as Christians, friends, we lay aside
[3235.84 → 3243.54] our privileges, our freedoms, our rights, our comforts, if it will mean serving others in the gospel.
[3245.18 → 3249.84] And I think a beautiful picture of this is the famous missionary, because we're kind of on the
[3249.84 → 3256.50] missionary theme today, the famous missionary Hudson Taylor. Hudson Taylor was just one of the most
[3256.52 → 3266.12] important missionaries to China in the 19th century. And yeah, there he is. He was known for conforming
[3266.12 → 3274.32] himself as much as possible to the Chinese way of life. So he would wear Chinese style clothing, as you
[3274.32 → 3280.66] see in the photo. And he would eat Chinese food. And he would learn to speak the language instead of using
[3280.66 → 3287.34] an interpreter. And he would live in Chinese housing, he would live among the people, he would adopt all of
[3287.34 → 3293.80] the cultural practices of the Chinese as far as they were not sinful. Now, this is the accepted
[3293.80 → 3302.10] practice for missionaries today. But in Hudson Taylor's day, this was seen as radical. Other foreign
[3302.10 → 3307.62] missionaries lived in their foreign compounds, they wore Western clothing, they ate Western food,
[3307.62 → 3313.72] and they would speak to the locals through an interpreter. Hudson Taylor, they thought, was a fool.
[3314.44 → 3320.52] They thought he was a madman. So in a letter, Taylor wrote to some new recruits who were going to join
[3320.52 → 3328.34] his work, and he explained the motivation behind his methods, which to others seemed so just crazy.
[3328.34 → 3337.10] This is what he wrote. I'll put the quote. If we really desire to see the Chinese become Christians,
[3337.78 → 3347.16] let us and everything unsinful become Chinese. That by all things we may save some. Right? Doesn't that
[3347.16 → 3354.12] sound like Paul? And then he continues, let us adopt their costume, acquire their language, study to
[3354.12 → 3359.42] imitate their habits, and approximate to their diet as far as health and constitution will allow.
[3360.00 → 3369.74] Then he says this, let the love of Christ constrain you to seek to commend yourself and your message
[3369.74 → 3379.34] to the Chinese as becomes the followers of such a master. Right? Let the love of Christ constrain you
[3379.34 → 3386.08] as becomes the followers of such a master. Right? Isn't that a wonderful statement?
[3387.70 → 3394.16] Right? Jesus is our master, right? Jesus is the one who shows us what it means to live out this paradox
[3394.16 → 3401.16] of the Christian life. Right? That we are the most free of all people, and yet we are slaves of everyone.
[3402.22 → 3407.40] Right? Think about Jesus. Is there anyone ever who was more free than Jesus Christ?
[3409.34 → 3417.50] No one has ever been so free who would go and eat with tax collectors and sinners, be called a glutton
[3417.50 → 3426.72] and a drunk. Not for his own sake, but for the sake of others. But he was so free, he could do that.
[3426.78 → 3435.74] He could do whatever he wants. And yet, no one was such a slave to others who said, you know,
[3435.74 → 3441.74] I came not to be served, but to serve and to give my life as a ransom for many. Right?
[3441.80 → 3445.62] So you have the freest of all beings, the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity,
[3446.10 → 3448.68] and yet the greatest slave who has ever lived.
[3449.84 → 3455.20] Because everything he did, right? Every act of mercy, every act of compassion, his death on a cross,
[3455.56 → 3459.28] carrying his cross to Golgotha, it was for you.
[3459.28 → 3465.50] And it was for me. Right? He laid aside his privileges, as we read in Philippians 2. He set aside
[3465.50 → 3471.02] his being equal with God. I mean, he retained that, but he set aside his privileges,
[3471.58 → 3479.38] the esteem that should be his, his dignity, his glory, and he did it for you so that he could win you.
[3479.38 → 3490.66] And in Timothy, we see someone who was prepared to give up anything because he realized he could never give
[3490.66 → 3493.66] as much as what Jesus Christ gave for him.
[3495.42 → 3500.28] So friends, let us, that be our paradox.
[3501.26 → 3502.16] Our paradox.
[3503.32 → 3506.84] We are free, and we are slaves.
[3506.84 → 3511.12] We are free, and we are free, and we are free, and we are free, and we are free, and we are free and we are free.
[3511.12 → 3513.00] Because that is who our master is.
[3513.42 → 3514.64] That's why he's done for us.
[3515.60 → 3516.48] So let's pray.
[3516.98 → 3519.74] I want to invite you just to have a moment
[3519.74 → 3522.44] to respond to God in prayer.
[3522.56 → 3524.54] Just to respond to this passage, what you've heard.
[3526.92 → 3528.68] You know, God speaks to us
[3528.68 → 3529.96] through his word in different ways.
[3530.06 → 3532.44] So just take a moment and bring this before the Lord.
[3532.44 → 3538.04] You know, what are you trusting in
[3538.04 → 3541.48] apart from Jesus
[3541.48 → 3543.94] for your salvation?
[3551.72 → 3553.96] Maybe what is God asking you to
[3553.96 → 3555.20] deny
[3555.20 → 3557.42] for your own sake,
[3557.72 → 3559.26] for the sake of others,
[3559.30 → 3560.30] and for the sake of the gospel?
[3560.30 → 3572.42] Let's pray.
[3573.94 → 3577.80] Lord, our God, we pray that we may understand this paradox.
[3579.48 → 3580.68] Most free of all,
[3581.72 → 3583.16] and yet slaves of everyone.
[3584.08 → 3585.64] Lord, help us to understand it,
[3585.70 → 3586.52] not just theoretically,
[3586.82 → 3588.38] but practically in our lives.
[3588.38 → 3590.50] that we may be willing
[3590.50 → 3591.96] to give up anything
[3591.96 → 3595.04] because we already have
[3595.04 → 3596.18] everything
[3596.18 → 3597.84] in Christ.
[3599.34 → 3600.80] So please enable us,
[3600.94 → 3602.34] perhaps even in this coming week,
[3602.48 → 3603.54] to meditate,
[3603.82 → 3604.98] to think upon these truths,
[3605.08 → 3605.96] and to apply them
[3605.96 → 3608.34] so that Christ may be glorified
[3608.34 → 3611.42] and so that we might be satisfied
[3611.42 → 3613.38] in Christ alone.
[3614.06 → 3615.22] For Jesus' sake,
[3615.42 → 3615.80] we pray.
[3616.52 → 3616.96] Amen.
[3616.96 → 3617.04] Amen.
[3618.38 → 3619.38] Amen.
[3619.92 → 3620.38] Let's stand,
[3620.66 → 3621.16] and let's sing
[3621.16 → 3622.02] our song of response.
[3622.08 → 3622.36] Let's.
[3622.36 → 3622.38] Let'SGA'

[3623.38 → 3625.12] and let's sing
[3625.12 → 3634.90] our song of response.
[3634.90 → 3661.78] Great is thy faithfulness, O God, my Father.
[3661.78 → 3669.68] There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[3670.36 → 3677.54] Thou changes not, thy compassions, they fail not.
[3678.12 → 3684.98] As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.
[3684.98 → 3693.28] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[3693.96 → 3700.32] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[3701.46 → 3707.94] All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[3707.94 → 3716.94] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[3719.94 → 3728.06] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[3728.76 → 3734.94] Sun, moon, and stars send their courses above.
[3734.94 → 3742.94] Join with all nature in manifold witness.
[3744.32 → 3750.94] To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[3753.32 → 3759.94] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[3759.94 → 3767.94] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[3769.62 → 3775.94] All I have needed, God, and has provided.
[3777.94 → 3784.94] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[3784.94 → 3790.94] Join us now at 101.
[3790.94 → 3796.94] Lord, that sin and the peace that enter us,
[3796.94 → 3803.22] Thy own dear presence to cheer and to God.

[3807.60 → 3811.90] and bright of dark tomorrow.
[3813.76 → 3816.44] Blessings of mine
[3816.44 → 3820.84] with ten thousand reach high.
[3822.24 → 3825.84] Great is thy faithfulness,
[3825.84 → 3830.06] great is thy faithfulness.
[3830.86 → 3833.56] Morning by morning
[3833.56 → 3837.56] new mercies I see.
[3838.60 → 3841.76] All I have needed
[3841.76 → 3845.40] you, thy hand has provided.
[3846.94 → 3851.16] Great is thy faithfulness,
[3851.84 → 3854.80] Lord, unto me.
[3865.14 → 3867.46] At this point, I would like to invite the deacons up
[3867.46 → 3869.08] to take the offering,
[3869.32 → 3870.50] which for this morning is
[3870.50 → 3872.62] for Cascade Christian Counselling,
[3872.68 → 3875.36] which of course is a support network
[3875.36 → 3877.18] for people suffering with hurts
[3877.18 → 3878.80] that are often out of sight for many.
[3879.04 → 3881.98] So, of course, it's a valuable thing
[3881.98 → 3882.74] to have in our community,
[3882.74 → 3885.08], so please give generously as you're able.
[3885.14 → 3886.14] Thank you.
[3886.14 → 3886.74] Thank you.
[3886.74 → 3887.28] Thank you.
[3887.34 → 3887.44] Thank you.
[3887.44 → 3894.60] and everyone I have ended,
[3894.60 → 3896.56] thank you very much, and I think
[3896.56 → 3912.22] for the sake of
[3912.22 → 3913.22] Amen.
[3942.22 → 3943.22] Amen.
[3972.22 → 3974.22] Amen.
[4002.22 → 4011.62] Let us come before the Lord our God in a time of congregational and communal prayer.
[4015.54 → 4021.62] Gracious, merciful, wonderful God, we exalt and glorify you this morning.
[4022.28 → 4024.62] From darkness you created light.
[4024.62 → 4031.98] You filled the earth with a rich bounty, fruit-bearing plants and trees, water teeming with life.
[4032.22 → 4036.22] Animals covering the earth, great and small, in abundance.
[4036.22 → 4040.22] You made the whole earth come alive with your glory.
[4040.22 → 4048.22] Then from the dust of the ground you created us and gave over to us this abundance to care for and enjoy.
[4048.22 → 4051.22] We thank you, Lord, for this church here in Ladder.
[4051.22 → 4057.22] We hope that in our small way we have helped faithfully and generously spread the gospel.
[4057.22 → 4061.22] We thank you for the leadership of this church, our elders and deacons,
[4061.22 → 4067.22] and for Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy who have diligently and faithfully led this congregation,
[4067.22 → 4073.22] instructing us in your ways and spreading your word in a manner worthy of your name.
[4073.22 → 4080.22] It is our privilege to be called followers and indeed children of the one true living God.
[4080.22 → 4095.22] Guide us your work through your Holy Spirit and turn our hearts towards joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[4095.22 → 4105.22] As we begin another school and church ministry season Lord, we especially thank you for our teachers both at school and at church,
[4105.22 → 4114.22] and for the many people behind the scenes such as accountants and custodians that also often go unnoticed, but help it all come together and work.
[4114.22 → 4120.22] Thank you too for the harvest that the farmers are bringing in at this time.
[4120.22 → 4124.22] Despite the dry weather, by most accounts we have had a bumper crop here in Delta.
[4124.22 → 4129.22] The blessings you have poured out to us are indeed too numerous to count.
[4129.22 → 4138.22] So help us Lord to be thankful every day, and to be generous and share our blessings with those that would otherwise go without.
[4138.22 → 4144.22] This morning we especially pray for those suffering in Morocco and Libya.
[4144.22 → 4149.22] With thousands dead from a violent earthquake, followed by an even more deadly flood,
[4149.22 → 4155.22] the prosperity we have enjoyed here in Canada must feel a world away to those who have lost everything.
[4155.22 → 4163.22] We beg you Lord for mercy, and we ask Lord that governments put aside petty politics and squabbling,
[4163.22 → 4166.22] and focus on relieving the hurt and the loss.
[4166.22 → 4174.22] May we always hunger and thirst for righteousness, as this is what Jesus asks of his disciples.
[4174.22 → 4181.22] And Lord, we ask too for your healing and grace for those afflicted members of this church.
[4181.22 → 4203.22] We pray for Pat, Ellie, Grace, Joyce, Carl, Jerry and Anne, Shirley, Annette, Diane, Hank and Liz, Ted, Jeanette, Henry, John, Sandy and Wilma.
[4203.22 → 4213.22] Whether it be a physical pain and sickness, the loss of a loved one, the suffering caused by old age,
[4213.22 → 4220.22] or indeed for some of our congregation members to live out their final days on earth.
[4220.22 → 4224.22] We know, Lord, that you are the great physician.
[4224.22 → 4228.22] You walk with us and suffer alongside us.
[4228.22 → 4231.22] Be near them and their families.
[4231.22 → 4236.22] As we know through you and you alone, we are saved.
[4236.22 → 4241.22] You conquered the grave and paid the debt for our many sins.
[4241.22 → 4246.22] And through the resurrection, we may come to the eternal life.
[4246.22 → 4249.22] Jesus, truly you are the Son of God.
[4249.22 → 4253.22] May we be compelled to sing your praises from the depths of our very souls.
[4253.22 → 4255.22] For you alone are worthy.
[4255.22 → 4258.22] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4258.22 → 4263.22] Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4263.22 → 4266.22] Give us this day our daily bread.
[4266.22 → 4270.22] And forgive us our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors.
[4270.22 → 4274.22] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[4274.22 → 4278.22] For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[4278.22 → 4279.22] Amen.
[4279.22 → 4284.22] I'd like to invite Jason back up to give us a parting blessing.
[4284.22 → 4288.22] And then, of course, a reminder that we're going to be joining together for a meal afterwards.
[4288.22 → 4302.22] Please rise.
[4302.22 → 4307.22] Yes, so please do join us right afterwards for our barbecue.
[4307.22 → 4308.22] And they'll be right outside.
[4308.22 → 4310.22] There'll be coffee as well for those who aren't staying for lunch.
[4310.22 → 4312.22] But please do grab some food.
[4312.22 → 4319.22] And also join us for the singing at 2.30 at Mountain View Manor.
[4319.22 → 4323.22] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4323.22 → 4326.22] To him who is able to keep you from falling.
[4326.22 → 4331.22] And to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4331.22 → 4336.22] To the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[4336.22 → 4339.22] Through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages.
[4339.22 → 4340.22] Now and forevermore.
[4340.22 → 4341.22] Amen.
[4341.22 → 4342.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4342.22 → 4343.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4343.22 → 4346.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4346.22 → 4353.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4353.22 → 4362.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4362.22 → 4368.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4368.22 → 4370.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4370.22 → 4380.22] All the earth and heavens sing praises to your name.
[4380.22 → 4392.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone for your sake.
[4392.22 → 4393.22] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are great.
[4393.22 → 4398.22] There is none like you.
[4399.52 → 4408.12] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4409.26 → 4417.74] Praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[4417.74 → 4428.02] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4429.16 → 4437.82] Praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[4447.74 → 4477.72] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son, praise the Son.
[4477.74 → 4507.72] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son.
