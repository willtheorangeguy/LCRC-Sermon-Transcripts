[942.88 → 951.00] Heaven and earth, rejoicing His holy name.
[951.34 → 956.36] He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[959.08 → 967.34] And I'll praise Him.
[967.34 → 971.18] He is exalted, forever exalted.
[971.18 → 978.80] And I will praise His name.

[1017.82 → 1020.68] You may be seated.
[1020.68 → 1030.10] and I'd invite you to join with me in a time of confession as well as of assurance of God's
[1030.10 → 1037.22] forgiveness as we come before him as people in need constantly of his forgiveness. So I'll be
[1037.22 → 1043.52] reading the first part and then in I assume it's bolded or something then, and it'll be clear that
[1043.52 → 1049.82] it's your time to join with me. So let's come together as God's people and confess.
[1050.68 → 1061.12] Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.
[1063.46 → 1072.98] My bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
[1072.98 → 1080.44] My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you
[1080.44 → 1088.38] and did not cover up my iniquity. I said I will confess my transgression to the Lord
[1088.38 → 1096.62] and you forgave my sin. And because of God's forgiveness we can turn to him
[1096.62 → 1103.98] acknowledging our sin and then assured of his forgiveness. Therefore, let all the faithful pray
[1103.98 → 1111.24] to you while you may be found. Surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them. You are my
[1111.24 → 1119.94] hiding place. You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of the deliverance. I will
[1119.94 → 1125.98] instruct you and teach you in the way you should go. I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
[1125.98 → 1135.92] Do not be like the horse or mule which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle
[1135.92 → 1143.96] or they will not come to you. Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord's unfailing love surrounds
[1143.96 → 1153.94] those who trust in him. Rejoice in the Lord and be glad you righteous. Sing all you who are upright in heart.
[1153.94 → 1155.94] And we continue with singing.
[1155.94 → 1157.94] And we continue with singing.
[1157.94 → 1163.92] Let's sing all you who are from Now to the Lord's run
[1163.94 → 1167.34] from my destination in faith. Here is your singingirim, you need me to wait.
[1167.42 → 1178.90] What Dallas
[1178.90 → 1182.64] You were condemned
[1182.64 → 1186.04] I'm alive and well
[1186.04 → 1189.38] Your spirit isn't in me
[1189.38 → 1194.90] Because you died and rose again
[1194.90 → 1203.56] Amazing Lord, how can it be
[1203.56 → 1211.02] To do my King would die for me
[1211.02 → 1217.46] Amazing Lord, I know it's true
[1217.46 → 1223.64] It's my joy to honour you
[1223.64 → 1231.72] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
[1231.72 → 1239.18] Unaccepted, you were condemned
[1239.18 → 1243.40] I'm alive and well
[1243.40 → 1246.18] Your spirit is within me
[1246.74 → 1252.18] Because you died and rose again
[1252.18 → 1260.18] Amazing Lord, how can it be
[1260.18 → 1267.64] And you were my King would die for me
[1267.64 → 1274.64] Amazing Lord, I know it's true
[1274.64 → 1279.64] It's my joy to honour you
[1279.64 → 1283.10] You know I do
[1283.10 → 1283.18] You know I do
[1283.18 → 1287.10] I honour you
[1287.10 → 1294.10] You are my King

[1301.56 → 1307.56] You are my King
[1307.56 → 1315.02] Jesus, you are my King
[1315.02 → 1322.48] Amazing Lord, how can it be
[1322.48 → 1331.94] I do my King
[1331.94 → 1332.94] I do my King
[1332.94 → 1335.94] I do my King
[1335.94 → 1338.40] It's my King
[1338.40 → 1341.40] It's my joy to honour you
[1341.40 → 1343.40] You know I do
[1343.40 → 1344.40] You know I do
[1344.40 → 1347.40] I honour you
[1347.40 → 1351.40] You know I do
[1351.40 → 1355.40] I honour you
[1355.40 → 1374.86] I do my King
[1374.86 → 1376.60] The privilege
[1376.60 → 1379.22] Of being able to celebrate
[1379.22 → 1381.36] Together as God's people
[1381.36 → 1383.32] Holy Communion
[1383.32 → 1385.32] A time when we gather to
[1385.32 → 1388.16] And it's important to remember this always
[1388.16 → 1389.56] We gather to remember
[1389.56 → 1393.10] That what Jesus did for us
[1393.10 → 1395.42] His sacrifice for our sins
[1395.42 → 1397.02] For our deliverance
[1397.02 → 1397.84] For our salvation
[1397.84 → 1398.94] To remember
[1398.94 → 1401.64] But also to recognize
[1401.64 → 1404.38] His presence with us right now
[1404.38 → 1406.82] That He is with us
[1406.82 → 1409.12] In this communion service
[1409.12 → 1411.20] In this feast that we share together
[1411.20 → 1412.78] But also
[1412.78 → 1413.88] And many forget this
[1413.88 → 1415.84] That we always look forward
[1415.84 → 1417.58] Until the time that we
[1417.58 → 1420.38] Celebrate with Him again
[1420.38 → 1421.34] In Heaven
[1421.34 → 1425.10] So it's past, present
[1425.10 → 1427.08] And it's always a looking forward
[1427.08 → 1427.76] To the future
[1427.76 → 1430.18] And we are here together
[1430.18 → 1431.78] As God's people
[1431.78 → 1433.40] So I want to invite you
[1433.40 → 1435.64] Especially if you are a follower of Jesus
[1435.64 → 1437.00] To join with us
[1437.00 → 1438.34] Whether you're a guest

[1439.88 → 1441.38] Join with us
[1441.38 → 1445.76] In celebrating this special meal together
[1445.76 → 1449.28] We'll do a short liturgy
[1449.28 → 1451.22] It's one that Pastor Jason has prepared
[1451.22 → 1452.90] That has translation with it
[1452.90 → 1454.46] And so
[1454.46 → 1456.62] There's just some liturgy
[1456.62 → 1457.42] That I will read
[1457.42 → 1459.36] As well as a time of responsiveness
[1459.36 → 1461.38] So I'll begin with reading
[1461.38 → 1464.44] The Lord Jesus
[1464.44 → 1465.82] On the night
[1465.82 → 1467.46] When He was betrayed
[1467.46 → 1468.96] Took bread
[1468.96 → 1472.64] And when He had given thanks
[1472.64 → 1474.22] He broke it
[1474.22 → 1475.92] And He said
[1475.92 → 1478.52] This is my body
[1478.52 → 1480.82] Which is for you
[1480.82 → 1482.54] Do this
[1482.54 → 1483.40] In remembrance
[1483.40 → 1484.46] Of me
[1484.46 → 1487.74] And in the same way
[1487.74 → 1488.92] After supper
[1488.92 → 1491.24] He took the cup
[1491.24 → 1494.42] Saying
[1494.42 → 1497.08] This cup
[1497.08 → 1498.52] Is the new covenant
[1498.52 → 1499.70] In my blood
[1499.70 → 1500.84] Do this
[1500.84 → 1502.14] Whenever you drink it
[1502.14 → 1503.44] In remembrance
[1503.44 → 1504.40] Of me
[1504.40 → 1507.20] For whenever you eat
[1507.20 → 1507.98] This bread
[1507.98 → 1508.76] And drink
[1508.76 → 1509.48] This cup
[1509.48 → 1510.84] You proclaim
[1510.84 → 1511.92] The Lord's death
[1511.92 → 1513.98] Until He comes again
[1513.98 → 1519.10] I'd invite the elders
[1519.10 → 1519.76] Serving elders
[1519.76 → 1520.56] To come forward
[1520.56 → 1521.30] At this time
[1521.30 → 1540.82] And we will have a

[1552.84 → 1552.86] Lift your hearts
[1552.86 → 1554.96] Lift your hearts
[1554.96 → 1555.58] Lift your hearts

[1562.10 → 1564.22] The mystery of faith
[1564.22 → 1566.46] Christ has died
[1566.46 → 1568.30] Christ is risen
[1568.30 → 1570.78] Christ will come again
[1570.78 → 1573.86] Christ our Passover
[1573.86 → 1576.38] Has been sacrificed for us
[1576.38 → 1577.40] Hallelujah
[1577.40 → 1577.70] Hallelujah
[1577.70 → 1581.44] These are the gifts
[1581.44 → 1581.88] Of God
[1581.88 → 1582.44] For the people

[1595.40 → 1596.52] We will have the cup
[1596.52 → 1600.56] There is
[1600.56 → 1601.34] I'm assuming
[1601.34 → 1602.18] A gluten
[1602.18 → 1604.88] So that's what
[1604.88 → 1619.42] Please sing this
[1619.42 → 1620.42] With us prayerfully
[1620.42 → 1626.50] How deep the Father's love
[1626.50 → 1628.42] For us
[1628.42 → 1633.24] How vast the uncle measure
[1633.24 → 1637.18] That He should give
[1637.18 → 1639.92] His only Son
[1639.92 → 1645.18] To make a wretch His treasure
[1645.18 → 1649.14] How great the pain
[1649.14 → 1652.16] Of searing loss
[1652.16 → 1658.10] The Father turns His face away
[1658.10 → 1660.94] As wounds which were
[1660.94 → 1663.88] The chosen one
[1663.88 → 1668.86] Bring many sons to glory
[1668.86 → 1685.18] Behold the man upon the cross
[1685.18 → 1691.02] My stain upon His shoulders
[1691.02 → 1696.94] Ascend Him my mocking voice
[1696.94 → 1703.02] Called out from undiscovered
[1703.02 → 1708.74] It was my sin that held me there
[1708.74 → 1713.74] Until it was accomplished
[1713.74 → 1717.70] His dying preference
[1717.70 → 1719.92] For me now
[1719.92 → 1725.44] I know that it is finished
[1725.44 → 1726.34] For me now
[1726.34 → 1728.98] Being enslaved either
[1728.98 → 1729.44] Or a student
[1729.44 → 1730.84] Or a student
[1730.84 → 1733.20] The Romanian
[1733.20 → 1734.10] Or a daughter

[2039.56 → 2048.54] And in the same way he took the cup.
[2049.60 → 2051.84] This is my blood given for you.
[2053.26 → 2056.32] Take, drink, remember and believe
[2056.32 → 2058.56] that the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2058.56 → 2060.36] was shed for the complete forgiveness
[2060.36 → 2062.10] of all of our sins.
[2069.56 → 2072.94] And let us pray.
[2074.32 → 2078.72] Almighty God, we give to you our humble and hearty thanks
[2078.72 → 2083.36] that you in your great mercy have given us your son
[2083.36 → 2085.02] to be our saviour from sin
[2085.02 → 2089.58] and to be our constant source of faith, hope, and love.
[2090.06 → 2093.68] We bless you for permitting us to show forth his death
[2093.68 → 2096.88] and to receive the communion of his body and blood
[2096.88 → 2098.60] through the holy sacrament.
[2098.60 → 2102.92] We praise you for uniting us more fully
[2102.92 → 2104.20] with the body of Christ
[2104.20 → 2108.82] and for assuring us that we are heirs of your heavenly kingdom.
[2110.04 → 2111.30] Grant, we ask you,
[2111.64 → 2114.08] that our commemoration of his death
[2114.08 → 2117.02] may help to daily increase our faith,
[2117.36 → 2119.34] to establish our hope,
[2119.60 → 2121.66] and to strengthen our love.
[2122.50 → 2126.50] Enable us henceforth to live always for him
[2126.50 → 2128.88] who gave himself for us,
[2129.60 → 2131.30] even our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2132.26 → 2132.70] Amen.
[2133.54 → 2134.42] Thanks be to God.
[2134.42 → 2157.44] I want to share a little bit with the children
[2157.44 → 2163.96] before they are invited to go to the Sunday school.
[2164.46 → 2167.94] It will be for kids ages three through grade one.
[2168.00 → 2169.80] There's just going to be one group today.
[2170.38 → 2172.48] But before that, I wanted to share a little bit
[2172.48 → 2173.70] before we send you off.
[2174.24 → 2176.00] And as many of you know,
[2176.08 → 2177.10] some of you may be visitors,
[2177.26 → 2181.16] so I serve as the chaplain to the seafarers,
[2181.26 → 2182.40] for the ministry to seafarers.
[2182.40 → 2184.76] So I wanted to show you a little picture.
[2185.04 → 2186.46] I just took this on Friday.
[2188.08 → 2190.96] And it's, I hope you can see that clearly enough.
[2191.22 → 2192.64] It's, that's me.
[2193.60 → 2195.10] You hadn't guessed it on the left.
[2195.54 → 2199.06] And that's the chief mate from India
[2199.06 → 2200.84] on the Costco Vietnam.
[2201.10 → 2202.04] It's at Send Term.
[2202.30 → 2203.28] They might have left by now.
[2203.34 → 2204.58] They were leaving around this time.
[2204.78 → 2207.02] So, but this was just on Friday.
[2207.02 → 2207.06] Okay.
[2208.00 → 2211.72] Now, I took that because I wanted you to notice the kids.
[2212.72 → 2217.22] I dressed differently there than I am today.
[2217.56 → 2217.76] Right?
[2218.94 → 2220.96] Especially, I have,
[2221.08 → 2223.08] and you can't really see it clearly, all of it.
[2223.18 → 2226.68] But you notice, in fact, before I go on any ship,
[2227.08 → 2229.06] I do a four-point check
[2229.06 → 2231.34] because otherwise I almost always forget something.
[2232.16 → 2233.78] So, yeah, I'm at that age.
[2233.78 → 2237.00] And so I always have the helmet.
[2238.20 → 2239.76] I have a vest,
[2240.68 → 2242.50] a high-vis vest.
[2242.90 → 2244.78] I have my port pass.
[2245.44 → 2246.96] And you can't see it really clearly,
[2247.06 → 2247.94] but I have my shoes.
[2248.10 → 2250.20] They're safety boots with steel toes.
[2251.00 → 2252.24] And, you know, they've got,
[2252.30 → 2253.36] so you step on things,
[2253.42 → 2254.62] you're protected and all that.
[2254.70 → 2255.88] So that's my four-point check.
[2256.28 → 2260.48] Hat, vest, pass, shoes.
[2260.72 → 2262.46] And trust me, I need to check every time.
[2262.46 → 2267.12] But I wear those for a reason, right?
[2267.24 → 2268.42] You understand that.
[2268.72 → 2270.52] I wear them because they're called PPE,
[2271.24 → 2272.52] personal protective equipment.
[2272.66 → 2273.66] It became very well known,
[2273.76 → 2276.72] that acronym during COVID, as you'll recall.
[2276.84 → 2278.64] But that was when we were using it way before that.
[2278.64 → 2281.48] And because it's important.
[2281.74 → 2283.58] I'm dealing, working in an environment
[2283.58 → 2285.76] where I,
[2286.82 → 2287.64] where we're,
[2288.10 → 2289.14] there's machinery,
[2289.72 → 2291.10] there are things happening,
[2291.36 → 2293.66] and it has its dangers.
[2294.02 → 2295.90] And so to be as safe as possible,
[2296.08 → 2298.08] we wear that PPE.
[2298.26 → 2299.08] We have to wear it.
[2299.08 → 2300.58] In fact, some require goggles
[2300.58 → 2302.54] and things like that even,
[2302.74 → 2303.56] but, and gloves.
[2304.34 → 2305.44] But this is the
[2305.56 → 2306.40] pretty much the standard.
[2306.52 → 2306.88] Well, I,
[2306.88 → 2307.76] I use that example
[2307.76 → 2309.58] because in the sermon today,
[2309.68 → 2310.14] that will be,
[2310.24 → 2311.52] the text that we'll be looking at,
[2312.12 → 2313.36] we're going to be looking at,
[2313.82 → 2314.92] in here in the service,
[2315.42 → 2318.00] at Colossians chapter three,
[2318.76 → 2321.16] where Paul talks about
[2321.16 → 2325.92] putting on certain kinds of
[2325.92 → 2327.92] character traits,
[2328.34 → 2328.80] virtues.
[2329.38 → 2331.06] But he uses the term for
[2331.06 → 2332.46] putting clothes on.
[2333.46 → 2334.66] In fact, I thought about,
[2334.86 → 2335.92] I called it the knot,
[2336.04 → 2336.84] which I'll explain later,
[2336.90 → 2338.26] but I also thought about calling it
[2338.26 → 2340.98] godly PPE or something like that.
[2341.16 → 2342.36] But it's a little different
[2342.36 → 2344.06] because in this case,
[2344.34 → 2345.66] it's, it's sort of a symbol, right?
[2345.68 → 2347.22] It's a picture to give you an idea
[2347.22 → 2349.74] that we put on these things.
[2349.74 → 2351.20] Because in this case,
[2351.44 → 2352.60] I get finished
[2352.60 → 2354.38] and I,
[2354.48 → 2356.30] I take them off
[2356.30 → 2357.88] when I leave the terminal
[2357.88 → 2358.82] or leave the port.
[2359.10 → 2359.90] I take those,
[2360.00 → 2361.92] this protective equipment off
[2361.92 → 2363.82] and I wear different clothes
[2363.82 → 2364.96] because it's dirty,
[2365.10 → 2365.64] it's greasy,
[2365.82 → 2366.38] there's coal,
[2366.48 → 2366.84] there's everything.
[2366.92 → 2367.92] So I always wear older,
[2368.22 → 2368.90] darker clothes
[2368.90 → 2369.26] and then,
[2369.46 → 2370.80] and then I change again.
[2371.26 → 2372.40] But in this case,
[2373.14 → 2374.86] the things we're called to put on,
[2376.18 → 2377.64] compassionate hearts,
[2378.22 → 2378.80] gentleness,
[2379.14 → 2379.72] humility,
[2380.10 → 2380.50] kindness,
[2380.74 → 2381.16] patience,
[2381.32 → 2382.28] things like that,
[2382.92 → 2385.00] those are permanent traits
[2385.00 → 2386.24] that God's people are called
[2386.24 → 2388.10] to be putting on all the time
[2388.10 → 2390.60] and wearing these things.
[2390.74 → 2391.60] And so that's what we're going to be
[2391.60 → 2392.98] talking about in the service today.
[2393.56 → 2394.80] Now I have one more picture
[2394.80 → 2397.32] because the story doesn't end there
[2397.32 → 2399.06] because I was in the
[2399.40 → 2400.22] as we were,
[2400.42 → 2401.42] this is what the chief made
[2401.42 → 2402.30] in the office later
[2402.30 → 2403.46] because we were,
[2403.76 → 2404.52] we took the picture
[2404.52 → 2405.78] and then we were walking in
[2405.78 → 2406.60] to the
[2406.70 → 2407.40] towards the office
[2407.40 → 2407.84] and he said,
[2407.92 → 2408.90] so do you take a picture
[2408.90 → 2410.30] on every ship you go on?
[2410.90 → 2411.38] And I said,
[2411.50 → 2411.94] no,
[2412.20 → 2412.42] I,
[2412.56 → 2413.18] I'm doing this
[2413.18 → 2414.06] for a special reason.
[2414.06 → 2415.62] And I explained to him
[2415.62 → 2416.62] that this service,
[2416.72 → 2417.16] I'm preaching
[2417.16 → 2418.78] and I'm giving a kid's message
[2418.78 → 2419.60] and I'm showing them
[2419.60 → 2420.44] about PPE
[2420.44 → 2421.54] and all that stuff
[2421.54 → 2423.24] and because I'm preaching
[2423.24 → 2424.28] on this text
[2424.28 → 2426.14] and I mentioned the text to him
[2426.14 → 2427.06] and he said,
[2427.06 → 2427.54] oh,
[2427.54 → 2428.00] that's great,
[2428.16 → 2428.96] I'm a Christian.
[2430.28 → 2431.36] And he said,
[2431.46 → 2433.58] and we ended up having coffee together
[2433.58 → 2435.58] and having a great time,
[2435.68 → 2436.48] a perfect time
[2436.48 → 2437.46] of fellowship together.
[2438.14 → 2438.96] He's from,
[2438.96 → 2440.68] from Mumbai in India
[2440.68 → 2441.14] but he's,
[2441.18 → 2441.92] he's a Christian
[2441.92 → 2443.18] and so I,
[2443.26 → 2444.44] and I ended up passing him
[2444.44 → 2445.26] these devotionals,
[2445.34 → 2446.20] they're In Touch magazines
[2446.20 → 2447.68] which I had just received
[2447.68 → 2448.88] from a woman
[2448.88 → 2450.96] in Victoria CRC.
[2451.12 → 2452.56] She'd sent me a box of those
[2452.56 → 2453.68] the day before I got them
[2453.68 → 2454.88] and I got a bunch of these
[2454.88 → 2455.24] and I said,
[2455.32 → 2455.44] hey,
[2455.52 → 2456.46] I just got a bunch of these
[2456.46 → 2457.20] really nice devotionals.
[2457.28 → 2457.42] He said,
[2457.48 → 2458.16] this is great,
[2458.24 → 2458.78] so you appreciate it.
[2458.94 → 2460.36] So it's neat how that works,
[2460.42 → 2460.60] right?
[2460.66 → 2461.60] How that all works out
[2461.60 → 2463.06] and God opens doors
[2463.06 → 2463.94] and I said,
[2464.08 → 2464.32] you know,
[2464.42 → 2465.40] feel free to share them
[2465.40 → 2465.92] with others
[2465.92 → 2467.04] as you are able
[2467.04 → 2467.80] because these guys
[2467.80 → 2468.80] are the real missionaries,
[2469.46 → 2470.46] the ones who are on board.
[2470.60 → 2471.84] So it was fun to see
[2471.84 → 2472.94] how that all worked together.
[2473.12 → 2474.36] But that's the little story
[2474.36 → 2475.34] of PPE
[2475.34 → 2477.30] and how we put on
[2477.30 → 2478.74] the right clothes.
[2479.12 → 2480.62] May I pray for you,
[2480.80 → 2481.54] all the kids,
[2481.74 → 2482.84] especially as they head off,
[2482.90 → 2483.58] those who wish to.
[2484.10 → 2484.38] Father,
[2484.38 → 2485.26] thank you for
[2485.26 → 2489.56] the kind of clothing
[2489.56 → 2491.00] that you call us
[2491.00 → 2491.70] to put on
[2491.70 → 2493.56] and remind us of
[2493.56 → 2494.70] and as we look at that
[2494.70 → 2496.02] in the service today,
[2496.72 → 2497.78] do lead us
[2497.78 → 2499.94] in wearing the right clothes
[2499.94 → 2501.24] and wearing the right kind
[2501.24 → 2501.88] of virtues
[2501.88 → 2503.00] in our own lives.
[2503.40 → 2504.06] Bless the children
[2504.06 → 2505.16] as they head off
[2505.16 → 2507.28] to their service as well
[2507.28 → 2508.80] and we commit them to you
[2508.80 → 2510.04] and pray in Jesus' name.
[2510.18 → 2510.42] Amen.
[2511.36 → 2512.70] I'll let the kids go.
[2512.70 → 2515.12] Your teachers are heading out as well.
[2515.24 → 2515.90] So feel free.
[2516.02 → 2518.32] Kids ages three through grade one
[2518.32 → 2522.20] are free to leave at this time.
[2522.20 → 2546.78] Okay, not all those people
[2546.78 → 2548.28] are ages three to grade one,
[2548.28 → 2550.50] but you understand.
[2551.50 → 2552.56] There's another service
[2552.56 → 2553.94] happening at this time as well.
[2556.10 → 2557.44] And I would invite you now
[2557.44 → 2558.18] to turn
[2558.18 → 2560.94] to the text,
[2561.16 → 2562.00] Colossians 3.
[2562.06 → 2562.86] If you have your Bibles,
[2562.96 → 2563.80] you want to look at those.
[2564.16 → 2565.76] It will be on the overhead as well.
[2565.76 → 2567.42] Colossians 3,
[2567.80 → 2571.96] verses 12 through 17.
[2573.96 → 2575.40] Colossians 3,
[2575.84 → 2579.12] verses 12 to 17.
[2579.62 → 2580.94] Before we read,
[2581.22 → 2582.50] let us pray.
[2584.70 → 2585.88] Heavenly Father,
[2586.96 → 2588.80] may the words of my mouth
[2588.80 → 2590.28] and the meditation
[2590.28 → 2592.34] of all of our hearts
[2592.34 → 2593.76] be acceptable
[2593.76 → 2595.18] in your sight.
[2595.30 → 2595.82] O Lord,
[2596.26 → 2596.96] our rock
[2596.96 → 2598.44] and our redeemer.
[2599.54 → 2600.34] And we ask this
[2600.34 → 2601.28] in Jesus' name.
[2602.28 → 2602.78] Amen.
[2607.30 → 2608.42] Colossians 3,
[2609.16 → 2610.72] verses 12,
[2610.72 → 2611.66] beginning at verse 12.
[2611.66 → 2613.44] Therefore,
[2613.88 → 2616.38] as God's chosen people,
[2617.24 → 2619.40] holy and dearly loved,
[2620.54 → 2621.68] clothe yourselves
[2621.68 → 2623.72] with compassion,
[2625.00 → 2625.46] kindness,
[2626.58 → 2627.30] humility,
[2628.40 → 2629.08] gentleness,
[2629.62 → 2630.66] and patience.
[2631.94 → 2633.18] Bear with each other
[2633.18 → 2634.64] and forgive one another.
[2636.26 → 2637.66] If any of you
[2637.66 → 2638.60] has a grievance
[2638.60 → 2639.40] against someone,
[2639.40 → 2641.44] forgive as the Lord
[2641.44 → 2642.44] forgave you.
[2643.30 → 2645.16] And over all these virtues,
[2645.68 → 2646.32] put on love,
[2646.68 → 2648.30] which binds them together
[2648.30 → 2649.98] in perfect unity.
[2651.12 → 2653.12] Let the peace of Christ
[2653.12 → 2654.76] rule in your hearts,
[2655.22 → 2657.34] since as members of one body
[2657.34 → 2659.16] you were called to peace.
[2660.54 → 2661.26] And be thankful.
[2662.42 → 2663.64] Let the message of Christ
[2663.64 → 2665.46] dwell among you richly
[2665.46 → 2666.22] as you teach
[2666.22 → 2667.48] and admonish one another
[2667.48 → 2668.34] with all wisdom
[2668.34 → 2669.82] through psalms,
[2670.00 → 2670.42] hymns,
[2670.50 → 2671.84] and songs from the Spirit,
[2672.54 → 2673.30] singing to God
[2673.30 → 2674.04] with gratitude
[2674.04 → 2674.80] in your hearts.
[2675.26 → 2676.92] And whatever you do,
[2677.56 → 2678.70] whether in word
[2678.70 → 2679.84] or deed,
[2680.64 → 2681.56] do it all
[2681.56 → 2682.28] in the name
[2682.28 → 2683.58] of the Lord Jesus,
[2684.14 → 2684.92] giving thanks
[2684.92 → 2686.14] to God the Father
[2686.14 → 2687.28] through him.
[2688.68 → 2689.64] This is the word
[2689.64 → 2690.08] of the Lord.
[2693.38 → 2693.82] Now,
[2693.92 → 2694.38] I've been doing,
[2694.52 → 2694.82] actually,
[2695.12 → 2695.92] all summer,
[2695.92 → 2696.72] we did,
[2697.06 → 2697.94] for most of the summer,
[2698.08 → 2698.66] I've had,
[2699.50 → 2700.64] because we're connected
[2700.64 → 2702.00] still with the Tapestry Church,
[2702.32 → 2703.62] and we have different campuses
[2703.62 → 2704.40] in the Tapestry,
[2704.56 → 2707.04] and around the Tapestry network,
[2707.32 → 2708.30] what they did this summer
[2708.30 → 2709.24] was the different,
[2709.58 → 2710.24] several of us,
[2710.36 → 2711.12] the different pastors,
[2711.84 → 2713.84] we chose a psalm
[2713.84 → 2715.62] to preach from,
[2716.20 → 2718.32] and then we alternate
[2718.32 → 2719.96] to the different campuses.
[2720.46 → 2721.18] So a couple of weeks ago,
[2721.20 → 2721.94] I was in Richmond,
[2722.34 → 2723.30] and then I was in Marple,
[2723.30 → 2724.46] I'm going to be in Coquitlam
[2724.46 → 2725.22] at the end of the month,
[2725.36 → 2726.10] and so we're kind of,
[2726.16 → 2726.86] you know,
[2727.04 → 2727.82] rotating around.
[2728.24 → 2728.60] However,
[2728.76 → 2729.86] my psalm was a psalm
[2729.86 → 2730.46] of lament,
[2731.06 → 2732.04] and I thought,
[2732.12 → 2732.92] here we are celebrating
[2732.92 → 2733.98] the 50th anniversary
[2733.98 → 2735.10] of John and BEV,
[2735.12 → 2735.92] and I didn't think
[2735.92 → 2736.32] a lament
[2736.32 → 2738.40] was quite the right tone,
[2738.86 → 2739.18] okay?
[2740.14 → 2741.14] But fortunately,
[2741.62 → 2743.38] just a month,
[2743.50 → 2744.44] almost a month ago,
[2744.52 → 2746.04] I officiated a wedding,
[2746.60 → 2747.96] and the wedding text
[2747.96 → 2748.62] that was chosen
[2748.62 → 2750.22] was Colossians 3.
[2750.54 → 2751.04] So I thought,
[2751.14 → 2751.48] okay,
[2752.06 → 2753.68] I can expand on that a bit,
[2753.76 → 2755.06] and I can use Colossians 3
[2755.06 → 2756.42] so it fits a lot better
[2756.42 → 2758.48] with sort of your context
[2758.48 → 2760.60] and the time of celebration.
[2760.84 → 2760.98] I mean,
[2761.00 → 2761.84] it's not all about
[2761.84 → 2762.56] that celebration,
[2762.72 → 2764.02] but we do want to celebrate
[2764.02 → 2765.58] in a special way.
[2765.68 → 2766.82] So I invite you,
[2767.26 → 2767.68] thus,
[2767.88 → 2770.38] the Colossians 3 context
[2770.38 → 2772.08] and that theme
[2772.08 → 2773.44] of putting on,
[2774.26 → 2776.48] putting on the right clothes.
[2777.30 → 2777.52] Now,
[2777.68 → 2778.64] he begins the text,
[2778.70 → 2779.96] so if you have your Bibles open,
[2780.48 → 2782.86] feel free to follow along.
[2783.22 → 2785.10] He begins by calling them
[2785.10 → 2788.12] God's chosen people,
[2789.14 → 2789.56] holy,
[2790.52 → 2792.08] and dearly loved,
[2792.08 → 2793.16] or beloved,
[2793.64 → 2796.08] is the word that's used
[2796.76 → 2798.20] in some of the translations.
[2798.96 → 2799.12] Now,
[2799.26 → 2800.20] those three terms,
[2800.20 → 2800.68] chosen,
[2800.86 → 2801.08] holy,
[2801.18 → 2801.72] and beloved,
[2802.24 → 2805.24] are loaded biblical terms
[2805.24 → 2807.28] because they're terms
[2807.28 → 2808.28] that are used
[2808.28 → 2809.20] for God's people
[2809.20 → 2810.04] in the Old Testament.
[2811.36 → 2812.46] They're terms
[2812.46 → 2813.36] that are used
[2813.36 → 2814.42] for Jesus,
[2814.82 → 2815.58] all of them,
[2815.76 → 2816.58] in the New Testament,
[2816.90 → 2817.94] and then
[2817.94 → 2819.36] they're terms
[2819.36 → 2819.96] that describe
[2819.96 → 2820.92] God's people
[2820.92 → 2821.78] in the New Testament.
[2821.90 → 2822.46] So interesting
[2822.46 → 2823.90] how he uses those terms,
[2824.30 → 2824.96] those rich,
[2825.16 → 2825.84] rich terms.
[2826.48 → 2827.28] But then notice
[2827.28 → 2828.46] how he says,
[2828.46 → 2829.42] therefore,
[2829.42 → 2829.46] therefore,
[2829.98 → 2831.26] as God's chosen people,
[2831.36 → 2832.24] holy and dearly loved,
[2832.84 → 2834.66] and the NIV actually uses
[2834.66 → 2835.22] the literal,
[2835.48 → 2836.40] clothe yourselves.
[2836.64 → 2837.86] It's put on,
[2838.24 → 2839.74] most translations use that,
[2839.86 → 2841.00] but it's put on
[2841.00 → 2841.80] in the terms of
[2841.80 → 2844.04] put on these clothes.
[2844.04 → 2844.16] things.
[2845.12 → 2845.42] Now,
[2845.64 → 2847.92] in the context here,
[2847.96 → 2849.00] it's important to look back
[2849.00 → 2849.52] a little bit.
[2849.62 → 2850.72] So if you have your Bibles open,
[2850.80 → 2851.70] it's not on the overhead,
[2851.86 → 2853.92] but look back at some of the other
[2853.92 → 2856.26] verses just prior to this
[2856.26 → 2857.66] in Colossians 3.
[2858.08 → 2859.22] Because notice what he said
[2859.22 → 2860.44] in verse 5.
[2860.82 → 2861.40] He says,
[2861.40 → 2862.82] put to death
[2862.82 → 2864.60] whatever belongs
[2864.60 → 2865.50] to your earthly nature.
[2866.48 → 2867.32] And then in verse 8,
[2867.62 → 2868.72] you must also rid yourselves
[2868.72 → 2869.58] of all such things.
[2870.34 → 2871.40] And he goes on,
[2871.98 → 2872.00] and,
[2872.22 → 2872.52] sorry,
[2872.62 → 2873.30] it doesn't have it
[2873.30 → 2873.66] in the NIV.
[2873.74 → 2874.62] He says literally,
[2874.94 → 2875.76] put away.
[2877.34 → 2877.98] Rid yourself.
[2878.28 → 2878.82] It's literally
[2878.82 → 2879.56] put away.
[2879.68 → 2880.60] So put to death,
[2880.86 → 2881.94] put away.
[2882.26 → 2883.70] And then in verse 9,
[2884.66 → 2885.50] and he says,
[2885.86 → 2887.54] you have taken off
[2887.54 → 2888.62] your old self.
[2888.62 → 2889.62] And it's just the opposite
[2889.62 → 2890.66] of the verb
[2890.66 → 2891.34] that we have here,
[2891.46 → 2891.92] put on.
[2892.16 → 2893.68] It's literally like,
[2894.00 → 2895.54] take off the other clothes,
[2896.30 → 2897.66] those other vices,
[2897.98 → 2898.56] those other
[2898.56 → 2900.06] so
[2900.06 → 2901.98] rampant
[2901.98 → 2904.14] types of lifestyles,
[2904.20 → 2905.12] but that aren't
[2905.12 → 2906.70] really Christian.
[2907.44 → 2908.94] Take those off.
[2909.70 → 2911.14] And then at verse 10,
[2911.26 → 2912.20] he jumps in,
[2912.54 → 2913.64] and he says,
[2914.36 → 2916.06] and you have put on
[2916.06 → 2916.98] the new self.
[2917.06 → 2917.80] It's the same verb.
[2917.80 → 2919.82] You've clothed yourself
[2919.82 → 2920.52] with this,
[2920.60 → 2922.12] with this new person.
[2922.12 → 2923.42] And then he gets
[2923.42 → 2925.06] to verse 12,
[2925.18 → 2925.76] and it literally,
[2926.06 → 2926.60] the verb,
[2926.72 → 2927.40] the first verb is,
[2927.62 → 2927.90] put on.
[2928.22 → 2928.46] Therefore,
[2928.62 → 2929.22] put on
[2929.22 → 2931.70] these clothes.
[2932.00 → 2932.18] Okay,
[2932.28 → 2933.82] so in the context,
[2934.16 → 2934.86] take it off,
[2935.38 → 2936.20] and then,
[2936.30 → 2938.04] and then put it back on.
[2938.36 → 2938.56] You know,
[2938.58 → 2939.14] it's interesting,
[2939.38 → 2941.52] in the ancient church,
[2942.22 → 2943.46] it was actually
[2943.46 → 2944.56] fairly common
[2944.56 → 2947.64] that baptisms
[2947.64 → 2949.20] for new believers,
[2950.08 → 2950.82] adult believers,
[2951.66 → 2952.92] were actually done
[2952.92 → 2953.92] in such a way,
[2954.30 → 2955.12] not always,
[2955.26 → 2955.64] but it was,
[2955.74 → 2957.08] it was reasonably common,
[2957.34 → 2958.84] where they would actually
[2958.84 → 2960.44] take off
[2960.44 → 2961.30] all their clothes,
[2961.84 → 2962.90] they would be baptized
[2962.90 → 2965.28] naked,
[2965.28 → 2967.22] they would come back,
[2967.70 → 2969.24] and they would receive
[2969.24 → 2970.50] a new robe,
[2970.80 → 2971.98] and put that robe on.
[2972.44 → 2973.28] And it was this
[2973.28 → 2974.24] beautiful symbol,
[2974.34 → 2974.72] and I'm not
[2974.72 → 2976.62] saying we should go back
[2976.62 → 2976.96] to that,
[2977.02 → 2977.78] or anything like that,
[2977.86 → 2979.06] but it's,
[2979.22 → 2981.38] it is a beautiful picture
[2981.38 → 2982.88] of,
[2983.14 → 2983.26] they,
[2983.36 → 2984.46] they would remove
[2984.46 → 2985.04] the old,
[2985.90 → 2987.90] and then put on
[2987.90 → 2989.14] something totally new,
[2989.14 → 2991.14] as this picture
[2991.14 → 2992.40] of what it means
[2992.40 → 2993.26] to be in Jesus.
[2994.30 → 2994.98] Maybe we can find
[2994.98 → 2995.98] a way to do that,
[2996.34 → 2997.12] that would be really,
[2997.30 → 2997.90] really rich,
[2997.98 → 2998.48] and full.
[2999.72 → 3001.46] And then he calls them
[3001.46 → 3003.38] to these new lifestyles,
[3004.14 → 3004.62] these new,
[3004.74 → 3005.60] these virtues,
[3005.88 → 3006.68] this lifestyle,
[3007.18 → 3008.60] of compassion,
[3008.98 → 3009.26] literally,
[3009.44 → 3010.60] it's compassionate hearts,
[3011.10 → 3011.48] kindness,
[3012.06 → 3012.54] humility,
[3012.98 → 3013.38] gentleness,
[3013.38 → 3014.14] and patience.
[3014.44 → 3015.34] Notice that he lists
[3015.34 → 3016.56] five of them,
[3016.56 → 3020.42] because in the previous text,
[3020.94 → 3021.84] twice,
[3022.08 → 3023.78] he listed two lists,
[3024.22 → 3024.38] there's,
[3024.50 → 3026.60] each one has five vices,
[3027.80 → 3028.28] anger,
[3028.56 → 3028.94] malice,
[3028.98 → 3029.44] all those things,
[3029.48 → 3030.36] and he has five,
[3030.50 → 3031.66] and then in verse eight again,
[3031.70 → 3032.68] he has five more,
[3032.86 → 3035.44] and now he has five virtues
[3035.44 → 3036.88] that were called
[3036.88 → 3038.38] to put on.
[3039.32 → 3040.38] All of these
[3040.38 → 3041.74] words,
[3042.58 → 3044.12] at one point or another,
[3044.24 → 3044.90] these Greek words,
[3045.06 → 3045.84] describe Jesus.
[3046.56 → 3047.56] in the gospels.
[3049.20 → 3050.32] And so they're words
[3050.32 → 3052.04] that are Christ-like,
[3052.34 → 3053.06] and they're called
[3053.06 → 3053.90] to be the ones
[3053.90 → 3055.22] that we put on as well.
[3057.86 → 3058.68] We don't have time
[3058.68 → 3059.52] to go to all the
[3059.92 → 3061.38] we could spend a lot of time,
[3061.50 → 3061.96] and trust me,
[3062.00 → 3062.84] the commentaries spend
[3062.84 → 3064.62] a lot of time on each one,
[3064.72 → 3065.86] they look at each word,
[3065.90 → 3066.90] we're not gonna look
[3066.90 → 3067.26] at each one,
[3067.30 → 3068.32] but I just wanna look
[3068.32 → 3069.16] at a couple of them,
[3069.84 → 3071.20] because notice what it says,
[3071.26 → 3072.08] he talks about,
[3072.92 → 3073.16] kind,
[3073.94 → 3074.42] oh sorry,
[3074.42 → 3075.22] humility,
[3075.22 → 3075.40] humility,
[3075.40 → 3075.50] humility,
[3075.50 → 3077.96] and gentleness,
[3077.96 → 3080.28] humility,
[3080.28 → 3083.56] and gentleness.
[3086.56 → 3088.84] The reason that's striking,
[3089.10 → 3090.70] and I don't think it strikes us,
[3090.76 → 3091.70] because we've heard it all,
[3091.84 → 3091.98] right?
[3092.06 → 3093.06] We've heard these words
[3093.06 → 3093.86] so many times,
[3093.86 → 3096.28] but in the New Testament time,
[3096.56 → 3098.20] that would have shocked people,
[3098.48 → 3100.32] because those two terms,
[3100.68 → 3102.28] humility and gentleness,
[3102.56 → 3103.74] though they were known
[3103.74 → 3104.64] Greek terms,
[3105.14 → 3107.34] they were almost never used.
[3108.50 → 3109.74] And the reason
[3109.74 → 3111.34] they were almost never used,
[3111.72 → 3113.42] was because they were seen
[3113.42 → 3115.00] as negative.
[3117.04 → 3119.92] They were seen as weaknesses.
[3119.92 → 3123.72] They were seen as the sign
[3123.72 → 3124.80] of a lowly,
[3125.20 → 3126.34] servile person,
[3126.64 → 3127.20] a servant.
[3128.14 → 3129.50] And that's not something
[3129.50 → 3130.62] people aspired to.
[3132.42 → 3134.02] It's somewhat similar,
[3134.12 → 3134.66] if you're familiar
[3134.66 → 3135.54] with the philosophy
[3135.54 → 3136.38] of say,
[3136.70 → 3137.58] Friedrich Nietzsche.
[3138.34 → 3138.98] Nietzsche,
[3139.26 → 3141.12] in the 19th century,
[3141.46 → 3142.96] was a philosopher,
[3143.12 → 3145.18] but he despised Christianity.
[3145.18 → 3148.08] And he despised
[3148.08 → 3149.78] that whole story,
[3150.10 → 3151.16] the Jesus story.
[3151.62 → 3151.84] Why?
[3152.28 → 3153.84] Because he hated
[3153.84 → 3154.70] words like this.
[3155.44 → 3156.54] He hated talking about,
[3156.62 → 3157.42] sometimes it's gentleness,
[3157.56 → 3158.58] sometimes it's meekness.
[3158.74 → 3159.82] But he hated that,
[3159.88 → 3160.94] because he didn't want that.
[3160.98 → 3161.22] He said,
[3161.34 → 3162.54] we need the will to power.
[3163.32 → 3164.12] We need to be
[3164.12 → 3165.12] the Übermensch,
[3165.28 → 3166.60] the superman.
[3167.42 → 3168.62] That's what we want.
[3168.88 → 3170.02] And that's what we're looking for.
[3170.06 → 3171.24] And he had that sense
[3171.24 → 3172.78] of the ancient Greek world,
[3172.78 → 3175.10] where they esteemed
[3175.10 → 3176.46] being people of power.
[3176.92 → 3177.72] And this idea
[3177.72 → 3179.32] that you'd be humble
[3179.32 → 3180.86] and gentle
[3180.86 → 3181.92] or lowly
[3181.92 → 3182.76] and meek
[3182.76 → 3185.40] was not something
[3185.40 → 3187.40] that you'd aspire to.
[3187.78 → 3188.26] And so when
[3188.26 → 3189.52] New Testament people
[3189.52 → 3190.20] heard this,
[3190.56 → 3191.18] it would have
[3191.18 → 3192.46] perked up their ears,
[3192.56 → 3192.68] like,
[3192.96 → 3194.06] who wants that?
[3195.56 → 3196.00] And yet,
[3196.04 → 3196.92] that's the kind of
[3196.92 → 3199.52] radical living
[3199.52 → 3201.04] that our Lord
[3201.04 → 3201.96] calls us to.
[3201.96 → 3202.66] because
[3202.66 → 3205.00] Jesus is described
[3205.00 → 3205.62] like that.
[3205.84 → 3205.94] Now,
[3206.00 → 3206.60] there are Old Testaments
[3206.60 → 3207.02] references.
[3207.16 → 3208.46] You think of Zechariah 9,
[3208.62 → 3210.12] where the donkey
[3210.12 → 3210.66] comes in.
[3210.78 → 3210.90] You know,
[3210.94 → 3211.24] he says,
[3211.46 → 3212.36] your Messiah,
[3212.52 → 3213.20] your king is coming
[3213.20 → 3214.50] to you on a donkey.
[3214.88 → 3215.76] And he's gentle
[3215.76 → 3216.24] and he's humble.
[3216.38 → 3217.20] But particularly
[3217.20 → 3218.76] in Matthew
[3218.76 → 3220.34] chapter 11,
[3221.16 → 3221.96] that familiar
[3221.96 → 3224.38] verse,
[3224.82 → 3225.32] you all,
[3225.86 → 3226.56] or many of you
[3226.56 → 3227.24] will know it,
[3227.36 → 3228.10] come to me,
[3228.50 → 3229.32] Matthew 11,
[3229.40 → 3229.70] 28,
[3229.70 → 3230.28] come to me,
[3230.38 → 3231.04] all you
[3231.04 → 3232.28] who are weary
[3232.28 → 3233.40] and burdened
[3233.40 → 3234.08] and I will give you
[3234.08 → 3234.48] rest.
[3235.08 → 3236.74] Take my yoke upon you
[3236.74 → 3237.48] and learn from me,
[3238.04 → 3238.98] for I am gentle
[3238.98 → 3240.88] and I am humble
[3240.88 → 3241.30] in heart.
[3241.40 → 3242.22] It's the same words.
[3243.20 → 3244.46] Jesus applies to himself.
[3245.12 → 3245.92] I am gentle
[3245.92 → 3247.08] and humble in heart
[3247.08 → 3248.44] and you will find
[3248.44 → 3250.04] rest for your souls.
[3250.44 → 3250.90] And again,
[3251.00 → 3251.70] people would hear that
[3251.70 → 3252.00] and go,
[3252.34 → 3252.56] whoa,
[3253.24 → 3254.40] who wants that?
[3254.40 → 3255.60] And yet,
[3255.68 → 3256.32] that's the kind
[3256.32 → 3256.52] of thing
[3256.52 → 3257.68] that has now become
[3257.68 → 3259.10] and has pervaded
[3259.10 → 3259.80] our culture,
[3259.88 → 3260.08] right?
[3260.16 → 3261.10] Because we've become
[3261.10 → 3262.46] such a Judeo-Christian
[3262.46 → 3262.94] culture.
[3263.36 → 3263.92] But it would have
[3263.92 → 3264.80] shocked people,
[3265.08 → 3266.96] especially in the
[3266.96 → 3268.28] Greco-Roman context
[3268.28 → 3270.28] of that time.
[3271.56 → 3272.70] So he talks about that.
[3272.74 → 3273.24] He talks about
[3273.24 → 3273.84] other things,
[3274.30 → 3275.28] bearing with one another,
[3275.46 → 3276.30] forgiving as we've
[3276.30 → 3276.72] been forgiven,
[3276.84 → 3277.88] which is such a
[3277.88 → 3278.46] common thing
[3278.46 → 3279.66] throughout the New Testament.
[3279.78 → 3280.30] You think of the
[3280.30 → 3281.44] Lord's Prayer particularly.
[3281.44 → 3283.00] But then he comes
[3283.00 → 3284.60] to verse 14
[3284.60 → 3285.44] where he says,
[3286.02 → 3287.24] and over all
[3287.24 → 3288.32] these virtues,
[3289.02 → 3290.52] love.
[3291.28 → 3293.10] Put on love,
[3293.60 → 3295.64] which binds
[3295.64 → 3297.40] them all together
[3297.40 → 3298.74] in perfect unity.
[3299.64 → 3300.44] Now literally,
[3300.76 → 3301.70] the Greek says this,
[3302.82 → 3304.52] and above all
[3304.52 → 3305.24] these,
[3306.08 → 3306.56] love,
[3307.38 → 3308.54] which is the
[3308.54 → 3309.44] bond
[3309.44 → 3311.42] of perfection.
[3311.44 → 3313.90] which is the
[3313.90 → 3314.42] bond
[3314.42 → 3315.30] of perfection.
[3315.72 → 3316.54] Now that idea
[3316.54 → 3318.00] of the bond,
[3318.76 → 3319.34] or
[3319.34 → 3321.10] you could also say,
[3321.64 → 3322.14] and that's why
[3322.14 → 3322.54] I called it
[3322.54 → 3324.02] the knot.
[3325.08 → 3326.30] And I used that
[3326.30 → 3327.66] when I was doing
[3327.66 → 3328.12] the wedding
[3328.12 → 3329.54] because we talk
[3329.54 → 3330.82] about tying the knot
[3330.82 → 3332.60] and binding it
[3332.60 → 3333.12] together
[3333.12 → 3334.72] so that it can't
[3334.72 → 3335.56] be taken apart,
[3335.68 → 3336.22] a tight,
[3336.32 → 3337.70] tight knot.
[3338.60 → 3339.18] Interesting,
[3339.30 → 3339.92] because the couple
[3339.92 → 3340.92] that I was marrying,
[3341.42 → 3342.60] they used actually
[3342.60 → 3343.38] a website
[3343.38 → 3344.50] for their,
[3344.76 → 3345.46] now they all do
[3345.46 → 3346.30] this online,
[3346.40 → 3346.56] right?
[3346.66 → 3347.16] The website,
[3347.30 → 3347.98] the invitations
[3347.98 → 3349.12] and all the program,
[3349.22 → 3349.86] everything's online.
[3350.66 → 3351.44] But they used
[3351.44 → 3352.08] a program
[3352.08 → 3352.74] or whatever
[3352.74 → 3353.56] you call it,
[3353.76 → 3354.16] it was
[3354.16 → 3356.18] thenot.com.
[3357.18 → 3358.08] And so that was
[3358.08 → 3359.60] what they called it
[3359.60 → 3360.88] because that idea,
[3361.08 → 3361.84] tying the knot,
[3361.94 → 3362.62] well that's what
[3362.62 → 3363.36] this is about.
[3363.36 → 3365.36] it's this bond,
[3366.78 → 3369.18] this welding almost,
[3370.30 → 3371.22] this knot,
[3371.70 → 3372.42] but interesting,
[3372.60 → 3372.96] he says,
[3373.30 → 3374.22] the bond of
[3374.22 → 3375.72] perfection
[3375.72 → 3377.42] or completeness.
[3378.82 → 3379.30] Perfection.
[3379.96 → 3381.14] Why does Paul say
[3381.14 → 3382.04] the bond of
[3382.04 → 3383.20] perfection?
[3384.34 → 3384.72] Well,
[3384.78 → 3385.88] I think part of the reason
[3385.88 → 3386.12] is,
[3386.14 → 3387.08] and many commentators
[3387.08 → 3388.68] make this point,
[3389.00 → 3390.38] is that earlier
[3390.38 → 3392.14] in Colossians,
[3392.14 → 3393.06] and if you want to go back
[3393.06 → 3393.84] you can check it out
[3393.84 → 3394.98] in Colossians 2,
[3395.18 → 3395.90] particularly starting
[3395.90 → 3397.10] around verse 16.
[3398.48 → 3399.40] Part of the problem
[3399.40 → 3400.48] in the Colossian context
[3400.48 → 3401.48] was there was this
[3401.48 → 3402.26] group of people
[3402.26 → 3403.42] who were coming in
[3403.42 → 3405.10] and who were promoting
[3405.10 → 3407.56] extreme forms
[3407.56 → 3409.72] of asceticism,
[3410.72 → 3411.50] what you eat,
[3411.58 → 3412.46] what you don't eat,
[3412.98 → 3414.26] what days you celebrate,
[3414.48 → 3415.64] what days you don't,
[3415.76 → 3416.36] what you do
[3416.36 → 3417.34] and what you don't do
[3417.34 → 3418.54] and all these kinds of things.
[3418.88 → 3420.48] And they were promoting that
[3420.48 → 3422.18] almost as a form
[3422.18 → 3424.02] of spiritual,
[3424.34 → 3425.16] super spirituality,
[3425.80 → 3427.24] of perfectionism.
[3428.86 → 3430.18] And so Paul,
[3430.42 → 3431.40] in response to that,
[3431.48 → 3431.66] says,
[3431.88 → 3433.74] there's another kind
[3433.74 → 3434.54] of perfection
[3434.54 → 3435.80] that you need
[3435.80 → 3436.50] to be seeking.
[3437.10 → 3437.96] Not that
[3437.96 → 3439.92] which divides
[3439.92 → 3443.30] and confuses.
[3443.30 → 3445.86] and it had people
[3445.86 → 3446.34] wondering
[3446.34 → 3447.52] in the Colossian context,
[3447.72 → 3447.82] like,
[3447.98 → 3448.66] how are we supposed
[3448.66 → 3449.04] to live?
[3449.10 → 3450.04] Do we follow this?
[3450.10 → 3450.74] Or what do we do?
[3450.78 → 3451.84] And it was actually
[3451.84 → 3453.26] apparently dividing
[3453.26 → 3455.50] the congregation
[3455.50 → 3456.94] there in Colossae.
[3457.86 → 3458.32] And he says,
[3458.38 → 3458.48] no,
[3458.54 → 3458.98] that's not.
[3459.26 → 3460.46] The bond that you need,
[3460.50 → 3461.54] the kind of perfection
[3461.54 → 3462.56] that you're seeking
[3462.56 → 3463.26] and the bond
[3463.26 → 3463.98] that will bring it
[3463.98 → 3464.46] all together
[3464.46 → 3466.70] is this love.
[3468.24 → 3469.10] That's the thing
[3469.10 → 3470.20] you're really seeking for.
[3470.20 → 3472.46] Not all the asceticism
[3472.46 → 3474.02] and all the do's
[3474.02 → 3474.60] and don'tTS
[3474.60 → 3475.16] and all of that.
[3475.30 → 3475.48] No.
[3475.74 → 3476.92] You want that bond
[3476.92 → 3477.44] of perfection,
[3477.58 → 3478.36] that love
[3478.36 → 3479.48] that brings
[3479.48 → 3481.22] real perfection.
[3482.92 → 3483.16] You know,
[3483.54 → 3485.02] the popular thing,
[3485.08 → 3486.24] I saw a t-shirt
[3486.24 → 3486.80] the other day,
[3486.94 → 3487.64] a guy was wearing it
[3487.64 → 3488.44] that said something like,
[3489.64 → 3490.42] I may have got
[3490.42 → 3491.12] not quite right,
[3491.20 → 3491.30] but,
[3491.44 → 3492.04] I am I,
[3492.60 → 3493.18] you are you,
[3493.44 → 3494.02] we are we,
[3494.30 → 3494.86] love is love.
[3496.20 → 3497.06] And you've probably
[3497.06 → 3497.54] heard that phrase,
[3497.62 → 3497.72] right?
[3497.76 → 3498.28] Love is love.
[3498.28 → 3498.72] Love is love.
[3499.02 → 3500.10] And people use that
[3500.10 → 3500.86] all the time.
[3500.96 → 3501.52] Love is love,
[3501.62 → 3502.04] love is love.
[3503.24 → 3503.48] And,
[3503.86 → 3504.92] sure,
[3505.12 → 3505.74] love is love,
[3505.84 → 3507.38] but what is love?
[3507.52 → 3509.06] Do people really know?
[3509.20 → 3510.06] Do we really know
[3510.06 → 3510.60] what love is?
[3511.84 → 3512.04] I,
[3512.50 → 3513.36] and I'm going to share
[3513.36 → 3514.24] a little bit about
[3514.24 → 3514.98] Jennifer,
[3515.18 → 3515.86] who couldn't be here,
[3515.90 → 3516.28] my wife,
[3516.78 → 3517.30] today,
[3518.08 → 3519.26] she said to say hi to everybody,
[3519.36 → 3520.10] she's on Main Island,
[3520.28 → 3521.16] I'm going there tonight
[3521.16 → 3522.76] to be with her
[3522.76 → 3523.44] for a couple of weeks,
[3523.78 → 3523.98] and,
[3524.18 → 3525.00] but she said to say hi,
[3525.06 → 3526.20] but she gave me permission
[3526.20 → 3526.86] to share this,
[3526.86 → 3528.36] because when she became
[3528.36 → 3528.98] a Christian,
[3529.94 → 3530.76] she wasn't raised
[3530.76 → 3532.56] in a particularly religious
[3532.56 → 3534.62] Christian family at all,
[3535.16 → 3538.24] and about age 19,
[3538.96 → 3542.18] she began to question,
[3543.18 → 3545.56] where do you find love?
[3546.06 → 3547.84] Is there any true love?
[3547.90 → 3548.90] And she said she was looking
[3548.90 → 3551.00] at relationships around her,
[3551.00 → 3554.42] and seeing lots of brokenness,
[3555.16 → 3556.06] and she said,
[3556.24 → 3558.54] does anyone really love,
[3558.70 → 3559.08] she said,
[3559.34 → 3563.46] real love that is trustworthy,
[3564.46 → 3566.24] that is reliable,
[3566.44 → 3567.60] that you can count on,
[3568.08 → 3569.20] is it there?
[3569.42 → 3570.00] And she said,
[3570.04 → 3570.76] I was looking around,
[3570.90 → 3571.88] and I saw so much
[3571.88 → 3573.08] that didn't fit that,
[3573.08 → 3575.68] and then she said,
[3575.68 → 3577.42] I started looking
[3577.42 → 3578.38] in my own heart,
[3578.74 → 3579.58] and realized,
[3579.78 → 3582.24] I don't love like that either,
[3582.58 → 3584.18] and I can't love like that,
[3584.58 → 3588.12] where is love?
[3588.66 → 3590.34] Is there any real,
[3590.88 → 3591.32] true love?
[3591.38 → 3591.54] I mean,
[3591.54 → 3593.16] we throw the phrase around now,
[3593.76 → 3594.96] but is there any real love?
[3596.16 → 3597.42] And then she found Jesus,
[3598.42 → 3599.10] and she said,
[3599.16 → 3599.92] at that point,
[3599.98 → 3600.34] she said,
[3600.34 → 3601.58] then I knew,
[3602.18 → 3602.38] okay,
[3602.60 → 3603.08] here,
[3603.68 → 3605.02] here is love,
[3605.74 → 3606.82] real love,
[3607.38 → 3609.12] that I can trust,
[3609.96 → 3611.44] and I can rely on,
[3611.88 → 3613.60] because only ultimately,
[3613.84 → 3614.40] he does it.
[3616.64 → 3617.68] That's true love,
[3617.78 → 3619.78] and that's what Paul calls us
[3619.78 → 3621.84] to have as the bond,
[3622.10 → 3624.22] that keeps us together.
[3625.22 → 3626.64] And then he goes on from that,
[3626.98 → 3628.10] and notice what he says in 15,
[3628.20 → 3629.90] let the peace of Christ,
[3629.90 → 3631.18] rule in your hearts.
[3631.24 → 3631.56] Interesting,
[3631.72 → 3632.62] that word rule,
[3633.50 → 3635.48] is like the
[3635.64 → 3636.74] it means sort of like,
[3637.00 → 3638.10] act as an umpire,
[3638.56 → 3639.92] or an arbiter,
[3640.64 → 3642.60] like someone who does arbitration,
[3643.00 → 3644.08] it's that kind of,
[3644.16 → 3645.42] of a sense for that,
[3645.92 → 3646.74] of that term.
[3647.06 → 3648.40] Let the peace of Christ,
[3648.90 → 3650.94] rule in your hearts,
[3651.86 → 3654.48] but notice that it's not just,
[3654.86 → 3656.76] and not even primarily here,
[3656.76 → 3658.56] an inner peace,
[3658.64 → 3660.28] just in your hearts,
[3660.28 → 3661.98] but immediately,
[3662.20 → 3663.06] he moves on.
[3663.74 → 3664.92] Let the peace of Christ,
[3665.04 → 3665.72] rule in your hearts,
[3666.10 → 3667.36] since as members,
[3667.36 → 3669.22] of one body,
[3669.22 → 3672.02] you were called,
[3672.56 → 3673.24] to peace.
[3674.88 → 3675.84] And he immediately,
[3675.84 → 3677.02] takes that idea of peace,
[3677.08 → 3677.86] and says it's not just,
[3677.94 → 3678.68] in your own hearts,
[3678.88 → 3680.34] it's a peace,
[3680.50 → 3681.42] within the body,
[3681.76 → 3682.78] based on the love,
[3683.04 → 3684.34] because you've put on that love,
[3684.68 → 3685.40] now you can,
[3685.56 → 3687.14] let that peace of Christ,
[3687.56 → 3688.64] dwell in you,
[3688.74 → 3689.34] but also,
[3689.82 → 3690.74] even more importantly,
[3691.16 → 3691.96] in the midst,
[3692.56 → 3693.52] of you,
[3693.84 → 3694.96] with your people,
[3695.54 → 3696.56] with the congregation,
[3696.56 → 3698.26] there at Colossae,
[3698.32 → 3698.70] for example,
[3698.80 → 3699.08] again,
[3699.24 → 3699.90] going through,
[3700.08 → 3701.18] these divisive times,
[3701.48 → 3701.98] he says,
[3702.10 → 3703.06] let that peace,
[3703.42 → 3704.80] rule in your hearts.
[3706.88 → 3708.12] We've just come through,
[3708.12 → 3710.74] a pretty contentious,
[3711.32 → 3713.34] labour issue,
[3713.62 → 3714.92] unrest in the port,
[3715.10 → 3715.86] you may have heard,
[3715.98 → 3716.82] about a little strike,
[3716.90 → 3717.50] that went on,
[3717.60 → 3718.80] for a couple of weeks,
[3719.30 → 3720.20] and let me tell you,
[3720.30 → 3721.28] it's the first time,
[3721.40 → 3721.84] for me,
[3721.94 → 3723.54] I've not been a union man,
[3723.54 → 3725.56] so it was the first time,
[3725.64 → 3726.22] for me really,
[3726.34 → 3727.72] to get a first person,
[3727.84 → 3728.82] like hands on,
[3728.96 → 3729.36] connection,
[3729.52 → 3730.40] with how,
[3730.50 → 3731.66] how labour,
[3732.18 → 3734.22] relations go,
[3734.78 → 3735.36] because,
[3736.16 → 3737.12] the picket lines,
[3737.18 → 3737.68] were right outside,
[3737.78 → 3738.14] our centre,
[3738.48 → 3738.78] downtown,
[3739.28 → 3740.36] and I met the guys,
[3740.80 → 3741.86] men and women,
[3742.06 → 3742.68] I met them,
[3743.04 → 3743.56] daily,
[3744.28 → 3745.32] and so on the one hand,
[3745.36 → 3746.52] I'm dealing with them,
[3746.82 → 3747.76] on the other hand,
[3747.76 → 3748.86] we work closely,
[3749.08 → 3749.86] with the port of Vancouver,
[3750.06 → 3750.92] and with the chamber of shipping,
[3751.12 → 3751.76] and with the companies,
[3751.88 → 3752.34] and all that stuff,
[3752.34 → 3753.64] and so we're kind of caught,
[3753.72 → 3754.56] in the middle of this thing,
[3754.80 → 3756.62] and you're trying to just,
[3757.44 → 3759.26] deal with both,
[3759.36 → 3761.34] and not say the wrong thing,
[3761.86 → 3763.12] which is really difficult,
[3763.30 → 3764.22] so for me especially,
[3764.68 → 3765.56] so it's,
[3765.76 → 3766.74] you just learn to just,
[3766.88 → 3768.08] shut up after a while,
[3768.16 → 3768.34] right,
[3768.38 → 3768.98] and just listen,
[3769.26 → 3769.46] hmm,
[3770.02 → 3770.26] hmm,
[3770.92 → 3771.46] hmm,
[3771.76 → 3771.98] hmm,
[3772.38 → 3773.56] I did a lot of that,
[3773.68 → 3775.16] in those couple of weeks there,
[3775.86 → 3776.06] and,
[3776.18 → 3776.92] but the
[3776.92 → 3778.28] the tension,
[3779.22 → 3780.44] between those two groups,
[3780.62 → 3781.46] and the anger,
[3781.72 → 3782.18] that I heard,
[3782.18 → 3783.32] I had not heard that before,
[3783.44 → 3784.14] to that extent,
[3784.58 → 3786.86] but they had,
[3787.06 → 3788.02] to work it out,
[3788.56 → 3791.48] they had to figure it out,
[3791.68 → 3792.84] if they were going to get back to work,
[3792.92 → 3794.30] and everybody wanted them back to work,
[3794.74 → 3796.90] and so they brought in arbitrators,
[3797.06 → 3797.66] and eventually,
[3797.86 → 3798.92] they were able to get a deal,
[3799.46 → 3800.86] but even in spite of,
[3801.06 → 3801.84] sort of this,
[3802.42 → 3804.42] animosity between the groups,
[3804.80 → 3807.68] they had to figure it out,
[3808.24 → 3808.82] and they did,
[3808.82 → 3810.60] I hope,
[3811.08 → 3811.62] it's working,
[3811.94 → 3813.14] I was there yesterday,
[3813.28 → 3813.92] again,
[3813.92 → 3816.32] they had to figure it out,
[3816.32 → 3819.20] peace,
[3819.46 → 3821.16] as an arbitrator,
[3821.66 → 3822.48] between the groups,
[3822.48 → 3823.54] and,
[3823.54 → 3825.34] if I may be so bold,
[3825.66 → 3826.94] I look here,
[3827.16 → 3828.14] as you are aware,
[3828.78 → 3830.20] in our own denomination,
[3830.44 → 3831.44] we're going through this,
[3831.64 → 3831.84] sort of,
[3832.06 → 3833.64] contentious time,
[3834.64 → 3836.10] and people are very focused,
[3836.10 → 3838.08] on the issues involved,
[3838.38 → 3838.76] but,
[3839.44 → 3841.30] I wish I heard more about,
[3841.64 → 3843.12] let the peace of Christ,
[3843.76 → 3844.16] rule,
[3844.74 → 3846.24] be the arbitrator,
[3846.98 → 3847.78] in your midst,
[3847.78 → 3850.58] because I'm hearing,
[3850.78 → 3851.82] too much of this,
[3852.18 → 3852.32] ah,
[3852.74 → 3853.58] let's divide,
[3853.68 → 3854.52] and go our separate ways,
[3854.98 → 3855.34] and just,
[3855.54 → 3856.12] it's all good,
[3856.92 → 3857.10] and,
[3857.78 → 3858.28] but we need,
[3858.40 → 3859.46] we need to be together,
[3859.60 → 3859.70] it's,
[3859.88 → 3860.92] we are called into,
[3861.26 → 3862.32] one body,
[3862.70 → 3863.08] friends,
[3864.00 → 3864.86] one body,
[3865.50 → 3867.54] how can you separate that,
[3868.54 → 3870.60] how can we possibly,
[3870.60 → 3871.60] separate that,
[3872.44 → 3874.76] we need to work,
[3875.04 → 3876.26] for the peace,
[3876.52 → 3877.16] of Christ,
[3877.78 → 3878.16] you know,
[3878.20 → 3879.20] it's interesting to me,
[3879.78 → 3880.12] that,
[3881.06 → 3882.26] when he gets to the
[3882.36 → 3883.42] end of this text,
[3883.86 → 3884.76] in 17,
[3885.02 → 3885.60] verse 17,
[3885.72 → 3886.84] we read through verse 17,
[3887.18 → 3888.08] if you go on,
[3888.38 → 3889.86] the very next thing,
[3890.02 → 3890.96] Paul does,
[3891.50 → 3893.10] is he talks about,
[3894.46 → 3895.10] marriage,
[3896.02 → 3896.44] wives,
[3897.00 → 3897.34] husbands,
[3898.12 → 3899.10] he talks about,
[3899.10 → 3900.28] family relations,
[3901.04 → 3901.48] parents,
[3901.90 → 3902.48] with children,
[3902.94 → 3903.84] he talks about,
[3903.96 → 3905.24] other social relationships,
[3905.80 → 3906.26] masters,
[3906.76 → 3907.38] with slaves,
[3907.38 → 3909.16] but the first one,
[3909.56 → 3910.32] is marriage,
[3910.86 → 3913.16] he talks about,
[3913.56 → 3913.90] how,
[3914.34 → 3915.14] the husband,
[3915.36 → 3916.10] and wife,
[3916.90 → 3917.22] as,
[3917.48 → 3918.74] and I think he's making the point,
[3918.80 → 3919.56] because Ephesians,
[3919.64 → 3920.34] makes this clear,
[3921.04 → 3921.32] that,
[3921.40 → 3922.24] that they are this,
[3922.76 → 3924.02] one body,
[3924.48 → 3925.48] one flesh,
[3926.48 → 3928.04] picture this,
[3928.12 → 3928.46] sort of,
[3928.78 → 3929.68] this love,
[3929.68 → 3931.82] and this peace,
[3932.36 → 3933.18] and this unity,
[3933.52 → 3934.38] in a way that,
[3934.84 → 3936.66] that so beautifully,
[3937.20 → 3937.64] sort of,
[3938.04 → 3938.58] parallels,
[3938.96 → 3940.56] the picture of the body of Christ,
[3940.90 → 3941.26] in fact,
[3941.38 → 3942.14] in Ephesians,
[3942.34 → 3943.68] he makes this very clear,
[3943.78 → 3944.58] we have that text,
[3945.00 → 3945.66] Ephesians,
[3946.10 → 3947.22] chapter five,
[3947.46 → 3948.56] when he's talked about,
[3948.78 → 3949.02] you know,
[3949.08 → 3949.52] submitting,
[3949.78 → 3950.24] and loving,
[3950.24 → 3951.28] and all of that,
[3951.66 → 3952.64] for this reason,
[3952.74 → 3954.08] a man will leave his father,
[3954.20 → 3954.64] and mother,
[3954.72 → 3956.20] and be united to his wife,
[3956.20 → 3957.46] and the two will become,
[3957.78 → 3958.30] one flesh,
[3958.46 → 3959.74] this is,
[3959.86 → 3961.20] a profound,
[3962.38 → 3963.00] mystery,
[3964.52 → 3965.58] but I am talking,
[3965.66 → 3966.82] notice how he makes a switch,
[3967.16 → 3968.12] but I am talking about,
[3968.16 → 3969.14] Christ and the church,
[3970.38 → 3970.74] however,
[3970.84 → 3971.78] each of one of you,
[3972.18 → 3973.14] should also,
[3973.46 → 3974.86] must love his wife,
[3974.90 → 3975.78] as he loves himself,
[3975.88 → 3977.56] and the wife must respect her husband,
[3977.72 → 3979.52] and notice how he makes that quick,
[3979.72 → 3980.72] the switch back and forth,
[3981.06 → 3982.12] it's about husbands and wives,
[3982.20 → 3982.98] but it's about Christ,
[3983.08 → 3983.70] and the church,
[3983.90 → 3984.84] and the body,
[3984.84 → 3985.94] and yet it's about,
[3986.20 → 3987.24] the husband and wife,
[3987.32 → 3988.58] and how they live together,
[3988.78 → 3989.62] and he says,
[3989.86 → 3990.68] and I love this,
[3991.04 → 3992.76] this is literally the Greek,
[3993.20 → 3996.04] this is a mega mystery,
[3997.04 → 4001.02] this is just a massive mystery,
[4001.30 → 4002.10] how this works,
[4002.26 → 4005.94] and yet it's so profoundly beautiful,
[4006.60 → 4010.04] this mystery of love,
[4010.16 → 4012.04] that is in a relationship,
[4012.04 → 4014.32] that lasts 50,
[4014.86 → 4015.38] 60,
[4015.54 → 4016.30] whatever years,
[4016.36 → 4017.60] it goes on for others,
[4017.70 → 4018.28] I'm sure it's,
[4018.38 → 4020.32] some who are even beyond that,
[4021.04 → 4024.28] what a profound mystery,
[4024.46 → 4026.10] and what a beautiful picture,
[4026.10 → 4030.36] there's no other relationship,
[4030.36 → 4030.84] there's no other relationship like it,
[4031.22 → 4031.50] right,
[4032.64 → 4033.98] like the marriage relationship,
[4034.10 → 4034.98] there really isn't,
[4035.16 → 4035.96] there's no one else,
[4036.06 → 4036.62] that you're going to,
[4036.62 → 4039.30] literally expose yourself to,
[4039.38 → 4040.26] in so many ways,
[4040.56 → 4041.96] as the husband and wife,
[4042.38 → 4044.14] and yet that's that beautiful picture,
[4044.60 → 4046.46] of Christ's body,
[4047.22 → 4048.50] and the kind of love,
[4048.66 → 4049.70] that's supposed to be,
[4049.70 → 4053.78] in the midst of Christ's body,
[4054.98 → 4056.56] it's an amazing picture,
[4056.84 → 4057.26] I think,
[4058.26 → 4059.00] well he goes on,
[4059.30 → 4059.66] quickly,
[4060.10 → 4061.24] let the word of Christ,
[4061.58 → 4062.30] dwell in you,
[4062.38 → 4064.46] just the importance of the word,
[4065.02 → 4065.96] as you teach,
[4066.10 → 4066.56] and admonish,
[4066.60 → 4068.20] we don't have time to get into all of that,
[4068.50 → 4070.06] and I love the connection with singing,
[4070.70 → 4071.40] with the music,
[4071.96 → 4072.70] that comes in,
[4073.10 → 4074.34] as we teach,
[4074.48 → 4076.16] as we encourage each other through,
[4076.30 → 4077.34] even through the music,
[4077.68 → 4078.90] and the singing that we do,
[4078.90 → 4080.12] but finally,
[4080.62 → 4082.18] just two final points,
[4082.96 → 4083.92] I want to really make,
[4084.02 → 4084.94] and then conclude,
[4085.38 → 4086.04] wrap it up,
[4086.44 → 4087.12] the first is,
[4087.20 → 4088.32] did you notice how many times,
[4088.32 → 4089.42] he talks about three times,
[4089.70 → 4090.26] be thankful,
[4091.08 → 4091.76] be thankful,
[4092.84 → 4094.42] verse 15,
[4095.18 → 4095.90] let the peace of Christ,
[4095.98 → 4096.58] rule in your hearts,
[4096.62 → 4097.80] since as members of one body,
[4097.86 → 4098.56] you were called to peace,
[4098.86 → 4100.58] and be thankful,
[4101.22 → 4102.44] let the message,
[4102.48 → 4103.78] it's literally the word,
[4104.14 → 4104.34] logos,
[4104.66 → 4106.08] but the message fits too,
[4106.40 → 4107.44] let the message of Christ,
[4107.54 → 4108.38] dwell among you richly,
[4108.38 → 4108.92] as you teach,
[4108.98 → 4109.94] and admonish one another,
[4109.94 → 4110.58] with all wisdom,
[4110.58 → 4111.30] through psalms,
[4111.62 → 4111.94] hymns,
[4112.18 → 4112.90] and songs,
[4113.32 → 4114.72] from the spirit,
[4114.98 → 4115.68] singing to God,
[4115.88 → 4116.98] with gratitude,
[4117.18 → 4118.26] literally with thanksgiving,
[4118.52 → 4119.40] in your hearts,
[4119.60 → 4120.76] and whatever you do,
[4121.26 → 4122.10] whether in word,
[4122.22 → 4122.70] or deed,
[4122.82 → 4123.28] do it all,
[4123.28 → 4123.98] in the name of the Lord,
[4123.98 → 4124.00] in the name of the Lord,
[4124.00 → 4124.24] Jesus,
[4124.24 → 4126.18] giving thanks,
[4126.18 → 4128.48] and that threefold call,
[4128.54 → 4129.84] to just thankful,
[4130.26 → 4131.12] thankful,
[4131.54 → 4132.22] thankful,
[4132.22 → 4133.74] to God,
[4134.34 → 4136.34] and then the second thing is,
[4136.90 → 4138.00] notice how,
[4138.52 → 4139.54] it's just,
[4139.64 → 4141.28] everything,
[4142.28 → 4145.06] verse,
[4145.22 → 4145.56] again,
[4145.74 → 4146.22] 17,
[4146.22 → 4148.32] whatever you do,
[4148.78 → 4149.70] whether in word,
[4149.78 → 4150.16] or deed,
[4150.50 → 4151.80] do it all,
[4152.40 → 4153.46] in the name of the Lord,
[4153.54 → 4153.78] Jesus,
[4153.94 → 4154.88] giving thanks to God,
[4154.94 → 4155.38] the Father,
[4156.68 → 4157.50] it's everything,
[4157.94 → 4158.90] and I love the way,
[4159.26 → 4160.76] we didn't read it,
[4160.86 → 4162.88] but at the end of verse 11,
[4163.36 → 4164.18] just before this,
[4164.42 → 4164.82] he said,
[4165.28 → 4166.68] he talks about this body,
[4166.90 → 4167.44] of Christ,
[4167.52 → 4168.80] now working together,
[4168.80 → 4170.26] here there is no Jew,
[4170.50 → 4171.40] or Gentile,
[4171.50 → 4171.82] or Jew,
[4171.96 → 4172.44] circumcised,
[4172.50 → 4173.24] or uncircumcised,
[4173.36 → 4173.88] barbarian,
[4173.96 → 4174.24] Scythian,
[4174.34 → 4174.54] slave,
[4174.58 → 4174.84] or free,
[4175.06 → 4176.46] but Christ,
[4176.78 → 4178.20] is all,
[4178.40 → 4179.72] in all,
[4180.28 → 4182.08] he's just,
[4182.36 → 4183.00] everything,
[4184.24 → 4185.84] this is Jesus,
[4187.24 → 4187.66] all,
[4188.20 → 4188.72] in all,
[4189.36 → 4189.72] you know,
[4189.74 → 4190.22] it's interesting,
[4190.40 → 4190.48] the
[4190.60 → 4191.42] I love the story,
[4191.76 → 4192.88] of Saint Augustine,
[4192.96 → 4193.42] the great,
[4193.42 → 4194.42] church father,
[4195.10 → 4196.34] because Saint Augustine,
[4196.40 → 4197.20] when he was struggling,
[4197.46 → 4197.60] with,
[4197.60 → 4199.00] whether,
[4199.26 → 4200.00] how to live,
[4200.16 → 4201.50] and whether to be a philosopher,
[4202.06 → 4202.60] and how to,
[4203.20 → 4204.70] what to do about faith,
[4204.76 → 4205.94] and he was really wrestling,
[4205.94 → 4206.46] with that,
[4206.80 → 4208.16] and he came to this point,
[4208.46 → 4208.94] in his life,
[4209.06 → 4209.20] if you,
[4209.30 → 4210.14] some of you have probably read,
[4210.20 → 4210.86] the confessions,
[4211.46 → 4212.80] very worthwhile reading,
[4213.00 → 4214.06] but he came to this point,
[4214.12 → 4214.62] when he's in,
[4214.74 → 4215.32] in the garden,
[4215.40 → 4215.86] he's just,
[4216.70 → 4217.80] crying out to God,
[4217.88 → 4218.50] for guidance,
[4219.08 → 4221.08] and he hears a little child,
[4222.08 → 4222.32] singing,
[4222.60 → 4223.52] in the distance,
[4223.98 → 4225.32] take a little dirge,
[4225.36 → 4226.12] a little song,
[4226.54 → 4227.14] a little song saying,
[4227.14 → 4228.00] take up and read,
[4228.18 → 4228.94] take up and read,
[4229.78 → 4230.96] and at that point,
[4231.46 → 4232.42] he picked up,
[4232.76 → 4233.70] his Bible,
[4234.84 → 4235.56] and just looked,
[4235.66 → 4236.34] it was one of those,
[4237.14 → 4237.36] you know,
[4237.40 → 4238.22] just open it up,
[4238.30 → 4238.70] and boom,
[4238.78 → 4239.36] there it is,
[4239.42 → 4240.42] and he opened it up,
[4240.66 → 4241.92] to Romans 13,
[4241.92 → 4244.66] and it's a text,
[4244.72 → 4245.84] or we'll look at it now,
[4246.18 → 4246.78] it's a text,
[4246.88 → 4248.96] that uses the exact same term,
[4249.04 → 4249.68] that we have here,
[4249.74 → 4250.98] about putting on,
[4251.20 → 4252.12] Romans 13,
[4252.38 → 4252.98] 14,
[4253.50 → 4253.94] rather,
[4254.44 → 4255.56] clothe yourselves,
[4256.20 → 4256.88] put on,
[4257.06 → 4257.98] the Lord,
[4258.42 → 4258.82] Jesus,
[4259.38 → 4259.88] Christ,
[4259.88 → 4260.88] Christ,
[4260.88 → 4263.76] and do not think about,
[4263.86 → 4264.48] how to gratify,
[4264.60 → 4265.54] the desires of the flesh,
[4265.66 → 4267.32] and that was the turning point,
[4267.46 → 4268.54] in Augustine's life,
[4269.08 → 4270.48] wait a minute,
[4271.08 → 4272.08] I have to put on,
[4272.60 → 4273.12] new clothes,
[4273.98 → 4275.42] the emperor's new clothes,
[4275.90 → 4277.42] the theologian's new clothes,
[4277.52 → 4278.62] the philosopher's new clothes,
[4278.74 → 4280.64] all of our new clothes,
[4281.16 → 4282.36] put on,
[4282.62 → 4283.40] the Lord,
[4283.72 → 4284.56] Jesus Christ,
[4284.74 → 4285.92] may that be true for you,
[4286.10 → 4287.18] continue to be true for you,
[4287.18 → 4287.86] in your marriage,
[4288.32 → 4289.72] that that love reigns,
[4289.74 → 4290.50] and it may be true,
[4290.60 → 4291.80] in our midst,
[4291.92 → 4292.74] and in your lives,
[4292.82 → 4293.34] your families,
[4293.74 → 4294.98] and in our midst,
[4294.98 → 4295.96] as a congregation,
[4296.36 → 4297.30] let's bow in prayer,
[4297.90 → 4298.34] Father,
[4298.44 → 4299.04] thank you for,
[4299.20 → 4300.52] this powerful word,
[4300.66 → 4301.54] that just speaks,
[4301.72 → 4303.40] of the kind of love,
[4304.26 → 4306.48] that we,
[4308.68 → 4309.68] search for,
[4310.40 → 4313.94] and it can be so elusive,
[4314.12 → 4314.70] so difficult,
[4314.84 → 4316.22] to really find,
[4316.22 → 4317.30] that kind of love,
[4318.50 → 4318.92] and yet,
[4319.04 → 4319.24] Lord,
[4319.34 → 4320.04] you made it,
[4320.28 → 4320.88] so,
[4321.66 → 4322.84] so obvious,
[4323.52 → 4324.04] and so,
[4324.54 → 4326.28] fill us with that love,
[4326.40 → 4327.22] and with that peace,
[4327.32 → 4328.28] and with your word,
[4328.78 → 4329.82] so that we can,
[4330.44 → 4331.04] put on,
[4331.36 → 4332.36] the right clothes,
[4332.50 → 4333.72] these kinds of virtues,
[4334.26 → 4335.38] that you call us to,
[4336.58 → 4337.14] bless,
[4337.64 → 4339.34] John and BEV,
[4340.38 → 4341.36] and their,
[4342.50 → 4343.58] celebration,
[4343.58 → 4345.36] may they continue,
[4345.36 → 4346.04] to live,
[4346.04 → 4347.00] in the love,
[4347.14 → 4347.74] that you've,
[4347.74 → 4349.38] built into their lives,
[4349.76 → 4350.92] and their time,
[4350.98 → 4351.50] with their family,
[4351.60 → 4352.12] this weekend,
[4352.36 → 4354.48] and for all of us,
[4354.56 → 4354.68] Lord,
[4355.10 → 4356.00] may we truly,
[4357.00 → 4358.58] have that bond,
[4358.68 → 4359.32] that knot,
[4360.72 → 4362.22] that keeps us,
[4362.44 → 4362.84] together,
[4363.40 → 4364.12] as your people,
[4365.18 → 4366.10] fill us with love,
[4366.18 → 4367.46] we pray in Jesus name,
[4367.96 → 4368.40] Amen,
[4368.40 → 4371.48] and in response,
[4372.10 → 4373.34] we will,
[4373.68 → 4374.88] rise and sing,
[4375.28 → 4376.82] may the mind of Christ,
[4377.22 → 4377.82] my Saviour,
[4377.82 → 4407.80] piano plays softly
[4407.82 → 4437.80] piano plays softly
[4437.82 → 4467.80] piano plays softly
[4467.82 → 4472.92] May I run the race before me
[4472.92 → 4477.98] Strong and brave to face the foe
[4477.98 → 4483.26] Looking only unto Jesus
[4483.26 → 4487.42] As I am a hundred more
[4487.42 → 4495.22] You may be seated again
[4495.22 → 4497.32] And we will have our offering at this time
[4497.32 → 4499.78] And the offering is for Arusha
[4499.78 → 4502.30] Which is an organization involved in
[4502.30 → 4504.26] Christian environmental stewardship
[4504.26 → 4516.06] piano plays softly
[4516.06 → 4527.86] piano plays softly
[4527.86 → 4539.66] piano plays softly
[4539.66 → 4551.46] piano plays softly
[4551.46 → 4563.26] piano plays softly
[4563.26 → 4575.06] piano plays softly
[4575.06 → 4586.86] piano plays softly
[4586.86 → 4588.86] piano plays softly
[4588.86 → 4600.66] piano plays softly
[4600.66 → 4602.66] piano plays softly
[4602.66 → 4606.66] piano plays softly
[4606.66 → 4618.46] piano plays softly
[4618.46 → 4620.46] piano plays softly
[4620.46 → 4624.46] piano plays softly
[4624.46 → 4636.56] piano plays softly
[4636.56 → 4640.56] piano plays softly
[4640.56 → 4652.36] piano plays softly
[4652.36 → 4654.80] We have the privilege as always
[4654.80 → 4656.80] To bring our needs and our thanksgiving
[4656.80 → 4659.46] And our praise to God in prayer together
[4659.46 → 4660.74] Would you join me in prayer?
[4660.74 → 4667.78] God of justice and mercy
[4667.78 → 4669.84] infinite love and grace
[4669.84 → 4672.34] Absolute power and wisdom
[4672.34 → 4674.80] We give you highest honour and praise
[4674.80 → 4678.04] For no one else is worthy to receive it
[4678.04 → 4679.34] Who can compare to you?
[4679.34 → 4681.44] Who can compare to you?
[4681.44 → 4682.34] There is no one
[4682.34 → 4684.44] In the words of King David
[4684.44 → 4685.48] We too say
[4685.48 → 4687.64] Listen to my voice in the morning, Lord
[4687.64 → 4690.40] Each morning I bring my requests to you
[4690.40 → 4691.88] And wait expectantly
[4691.88 → 4694.34] We do this together now
[4694.34 → 4696.78] Knowing that you wait for us to come to you
[4696.78 → 4699.10] With our Thanksgiving and our requests
[4699.10 → 4702.04] We pray for your church, Jesus
[4702.04 → 4703.14] All over the world
[4703.14 → 4705.80] Give us always eyes to see
[4705.80 → 4706.90] That you are at work
[4706.90 → 4709.16] Turning this world upside down
[4709.16 → 4711.54] Human logic would expect
[4711.54 → 4713.08] That a church violently persecuted
[4713.08 → 4714.30] Would slowly die
[4714.30 → 4716.50] But instead it grows stronger
[4716.50 → 4720.32] Your spirit weaves perseverance and joy
[4720.32 → 4722.46] From threads of hardship and suffering
[4722.46 → 4725.02] Thank you for this beautiful gift
[4725.02 → 4727.30] Continue to build your kingdom
[4727.30 → 4728.86] Where believers are threatened
[4728.86 → 4731.60] Also in areas where there is war and oppression
[4731.60 → 4734.24] Thank you for those who work
[4734.24 → 4735.50] To relieve the suffering
[4735.50 → 4737.10] Give them the strength they need
[4737.10 → 4739.50] To keep going day in and day out
[4739.50 → 4741.96] Thank you for your message
[4741.96 → 4744.66] That Pastor Gary brought to us this morning
[4744.66 → 4746.76] And for his work among the seafarers
[4746.76 → 4750.32] Even when language is a barrier in his work
[4750.32 → 4752.04] May the love he shows
[4752.04 → 4753.34] And the gospel he brings
[4753.34 → 4755.38] Give comfort to lonely hearts of men
[4755.38 → 4757.00] So far from home and family
[4757.00 → 4760.50] These seafarers do their work for our benefits
[4760.50 → 4762.04] So that we can receive goods
[4762.04 → 4763.32] From other parts of the world
[4763.32 → 4765.76] We rarely think of the sacrifices
[4765.76 → 4767.10] Others make for our benefit
[4767.10 → 4768.90] And today we thank you
[4768.90 → 4770.52] For their willingness to do this
[4770.52 → 4772.98] We are grateful today
[4772.98 → 4774.28] For the privilege to invest
[4774.28 → 4775.74] In the work of Arusha Canada
[4775.74 → 4778.08] The work they do to educate
[4778.08 → 4779.70] And support creation care
[4779.70 → 4781.92] Give us all an urgency
[4781.92 → 4783.50] To care for what you have made
[4783.50 → 4784.78] This beautiful earth
[4784.78 → 4786.56] That you have given us to steward
[4786.56 → 4789.32] God of all compassion
[4789.32 → 4791.38] We have been so shocked and saddened
[4791.38 → 4793.62] By the wildfires on the island of Maui
[4793.62 → 4796.68] We pray earnestly for the people impacted
[4796.68 → 4799.28] Those who have lost family members
[4799.28 → 4800.86] And friends in this unexpected
[4800.86 → 4802.26] And devastating tragedy
[4802.26 → 4804.12] Be their helper
[4804.12 → 4805.10] Their refuge
[4805.10 → 4806.66] Their gracious father
[4806.66 → 4809.32] Give strength to those who work
[4809.32 → 4811.04] To bring restoration to the island
[4811.04 → 4812.84] May aid come quickly
[4812.84 → 4814.44] To those who are homeless
[4814.44 → 4817.36] This is such a reminder to us
[4817.36 → 4819.06] That we too are vulnerable
[4819.06 → 4821.14] To sudden and unexpected loss
[4821.14 → 4822.72] Of anything and everything
[4822.72 → 4825.40] May this knowledge humble us
[4825.40 → 4826.42] And strengthen us
[4826.42 → 4828.00] In our dependence on you
[4828.00 → 4830.98] We bring before you
[4830.98 → 4832.44] Those of us who are ill
[4832.44 → 4834.10] Or on a journey of recovery
[4834.10 → 4837.96] Place your healing hands
[4837.96 → 4842.06] On Amy, Annette, Eileen, Pat, and Tony
[4842.06 → 4844.16] Provide comfort for Ellie
[4844.16 → 4845.26] Who has been in a new
[4845.26 → 4846.36] And confusing environment
[4846.36 → 4847.26] For a few weeks
[4847.26 → 4848.56] Because of a broken arm
[4848.56 → 4851.96] We thank you for measures of healing
[4851.96 → 4853.62] For each of these members
[4853.62 → 4855.00] Of our family of faith

[4857.36 → 4859.06] And a deep sense of your presence
[4859.06 → 4861.98] Some among us struggle privately
[4861.98 → 4862.68] With pain
[4862.68 → 4863.82] A time of doubt
[4863.82 → 4864.96] In spiritual wilderness
[4864.96 → 4866.34] Troubling apathy
[4866.34 → 4867.78] And dullness of soul

[4870.70 → 4872.76] Comfort all who mourn
[4872.76 → 4874.00] The loss of loved ones
[4874.00 → 4875.82] Or loss of relationships
[4875.82 → 4876.94] Meaningful work
[4876.94 → 4877.94] Or health
[4877.94 → 4880.28] May we as a body of faith
[4880.28 → 4881.64] Walk together in love
[4881.64 → 4882.88] Caring for each other
[4882.88 → 4885.52] Being Christ's eyes, ears, heart
[4885.52 → 4886.50] Hands and feet
[4886.50 → 4887.28] To one another
[4887.28 → 4890.04] We praise you this morning
[4890.04 → 4891.00] For your faithfulness
[4891.00 → 4891.80] To John and BEV

[4900.22 → 4901.44] For the gift they are
[4901.44 → 4902.56] In this body of believers
[4902.56 → 4905.02] And for all the kingdom work
[4905.02 → 4906.68] They do in various capacities
[4906.68 → 4908.22] Thank you, Lord
[4908.22 → 4908.90] For their family
[4908.90 → 4910.10] That surrounds them today
[4910.10 → 4911.38] May they enjoy
[4911.38 → 4913.10] This wonderful milestone together
[4913.10 → 4915.70] Lord, hear our praise
[4915.70 → 4916.38] And requests
[4916.38 → 4917.38] For you are worthy
[4917.38 → 4918.34] And only you
[4918.34 → 4919.92] Can redeem the brokenness
[4919.92 → 4920.54] Within us
[4920.54 → 4921.92] And in the world around us
[4921.92 → 4923.86] We are comforted
[4923.86 → 4924.50] To know
[4924.50 → 4925.42] That there is nowhere
[4925.42 → 4926.24] We can go
[4926.24 → 4927.32] From your spirit
[4927.32 → 4929.12] When we are in Christ Jesus
[4929.12 → 4931.48] As we enter the coming week
[4931.48 → 4932.22] May we listen
[4932.22 → 4933.08] For your voice
[4933.08 → 4933.90] And pay attention
[4933.90 → 4935.04] To the promptings
[4935.04 → 4935.80] Of your spirit
[4935.80 → 4937.58] Give us eyes
[4937.58 → 4938.92] To see the wonders you do
[4938.92 → 4940.28] Encourage us
[4940.28 → 4941.36] And when we are weak
[4941.36 → 4942.64] Make us strong
[4942.64 → 4943.22] In you
[4943.22 → 4944.92] Hear our prayer
[4944.92 → 4946.02] In the name of Jesus
[4946.02 → 4947.64] Name above all names
[4947.64 → 4948.56] Amen
[4948.56 → 4964.40] At this time
[4964.40 → 4965.56] I would invite you
[4965.56 → 4966.30] To rise
[4966.30 → 4970.12] Rise and receive
[4970.12 → 4972.58] God's parting blessing
[4972.58 → 4974.28] God's parting benediction
[4974.28 → 4976.32] This was actually
[4976.32 → 4976.96] The benediction
[4976.96 → 4978.12] I also read
[4978.12 → 4979.06] At the wedding

[4979.80 → 4980.70] A little wedding
[4980.70 → 4981.92] Benediction as well

[4993.68 → 4994.64] In this world
[4994.64 → 4996.36] So that those
[4996.36 → 4997.32] To whom love
[4997.32 → 4998.60] Is a stranger
[4998.60 → 5000.92] Will find in you
