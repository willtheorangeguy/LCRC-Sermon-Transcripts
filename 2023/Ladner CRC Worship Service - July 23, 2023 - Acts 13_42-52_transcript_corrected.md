[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[272.00 → 274.00] Amen.
[274.00 → 276.00] Amen.
[276.00 → 278.00] Amen.
[278.00 → 279.00] Amen.
[279.00 → 280.00] Amen.
[280.00 → 281.00] Good morning.
[281.00 → 284.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[284.00 → 293.00] And our Lord welcomes those of feeble faith, those of broken bodies and sorrowing spirits.
[293.00 → 303.00] And so you can be sure, however you came this morning, the Lord welcomes those who come seeking him, seeking healing.
[303.00 → 313.00] And it's our hope that as we all come this morning, that we would have a sense of the Lord's welcome this morning to each one of us.
[313.00 → 317.00] My name is Jason True, and I'll be leading us in our worship this morning.
[317.00 → 326.00] And if you are visiting with us this summer or joining us for the first time, I especially want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[326.00 → 335.00] And so we've had a guest over the last couple of weeks, and this is their last Sunday with us.
[335.00 → 337.00] So I thought it was a good chance to introduce them.
[337.00 → 345.00] And so we have with us Pastor Steve Shelley and his wife Marty, and they are visiting from Virginia.
[345.00 → 350.00] They actually married my wife Christy's sister.
[350.00 → 351.00] And they're visiting.
[351.00 → 360.00] And as a visiting rabbi, I thought, stand and offer us a word of exhortation.
[364.00 → 365.00] Thank you so much.
[365.00 → 368.00] I've been on sabbatical this summer.
[368.00 → 373.00] My church has given me a three-month break and a great gift.
[373.00 → 375.00] We're so grateful for that.
[375.00 → 383.00] And it has been wonderful to be here with you these last, today's our fourth Sunday.
[383.00 → 390.00] And you never know when you visit churches what's going to happen.
[390.00 → 392.00] What's it going to be like?
[392.00 → 403.00] And I want to encourage you with the very warm welcome and greeting that we have received.
[403.00 → 404.00] We felt right at home.
[404.00 → 409.00] And it's been a wonderful thing for us.
[409.00 → 416.00] Paul writes in his letter to the church at Rome lots of great theology.
[416.00 → 420.00] We're all, you know, as Reformed people, you know, we love Romans.
[420.00 → 421.00] It's great.
[421.00 → 424.00] But there's a whole chapter at the end of Romans where he says,
[424.00 → 429.00] greet, greet, greet, greet, greet.
[429.00 → 433.00] You folks have fulfilled that to us.
[433.00 → 440.00] It's been very good for our souls to be so warmly greeted and welcomed.
[440.00 → 447.00] And I told Jason last week, you know, pastors wonder and worry, you know.
[447.00 → 453.00] Paul said he was anxious for all the churches and pastors are anxious for their churches.
[453.00 → 461.00] But one of the things that is true and one of the things that we know about our God is that he is a welcoming God.
[461.00 → 478.00] And that when his people reflect that characteristic and being welcoming themselves, it is a sign to me and should be an encouraging sign to you that the spirit of God is alive in this congregation and at work.
[478.00 → 480.00] So you should be encouraged.
[480.00 → 481.00] We're encouraged.
[481.00 → 484.00] We have delighted in being with you.
[484.00 → 485.00] So thanks much.
[485.00 → 486.00] Thank you.
[486.00 → 492.00] I'll pay you after.
[492.00 → 493.00] Okay.
[493.00 → 499.00] All right.
[499.00 → 508.00] The way that we like to think about worship in our church and in the Reformed tradition is that it's really it's a conversation.
[508.00 → 512.00] It's a conversation between God and us, his people.
[512.00 → 520.00] God speaks to us through his word, and we respond in worship and in various ways.
[520.00 → 531.00] And it's a conversation that begins with God calling us in to worship him and then us responding in prayer and in praise.
[531.00 → 535.00] So let's hear God's call to worship this morning from Psalm 28.
[535.00 → 544.00] Praise be to the Lord for he has heard my cry for mercy.
[544.00 → 547.00] The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[547.00 → 552.00] My heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
[552.00 → 558.00] My heart leaps for joy and with my song I praise him.
[558.00 → 564.00] The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
[564.00 → 569.00] Save your people and bless your inheritance.
[569.00 → 573.00] Be their shepherd and carry them forever.
[573.00 → 580.00] Please pray with me as we respond to God's welcome his call in a prayer of adoration.
[580.00 → 581.00] Let's pray.
[581.00 → 589.00] Oh Lord, we do praise you this morning because you are the almighty king.
[589.00 → 596.00] All the beauty that we see around us was spoken into existence by your creative word.
[596.00 → 606.00] And all the joys that we experience in this life find their source in your kindness, in your perfect love.
[606.00 → 613.00] All the material blessings, the bodies that we enjoy come from you who richly provides all things.
[613.00 → 616.00] So we praise you this morning, oh Lord, for your grace.
[616.00 → 621.00] Oh Lord, none of us are here because we found you.
[621.00 → 625.00] But you sought us when we were strangers.
[625.00 → 629.00] When we were separated from you by our own spiritual blindness.
[629.00 → 634.00] When we were estranged by our enchantment with the world and the things of this world.
[634.00 → 639.00] And our failure to see you and to seek you and to worship you.
[639.00 → 645.00] And so young or old, we stand in your presence because you are full of mercy and grace.
[645.00 → 656.00] You chose to seek after us, to rescue us in our danger through the precious blood of your son, Jesus Christ.
[656.00 → 661.00] And Lord, we praise you this morning because your grace in Christ does not run out.
[661.00 → 664.00] Your grace to us does not run dry.
[664.00 → 667.00] Your grace is greater than all of our sin.
[667.00 → 672.00] So you continue to seek after us, your children, even in our weakness.
[672.00 → 675.00] Binding our wandering hearts to you.
[675.00 → 680.00] And so Lord, would you bind us to yourself, to yourself again this morning.
[680.00 → 683.00] We pray in the glorious name of Christ our Lord.
[683.00 → 685.00] Amen.
[685.00 → 688.00] So brothers and sisters, let's stand.
[688.00 → 695.00] And we receive God's greeting to us this morning from 1 Samuel chapter 2.
[695.00 → 698.00] There is no one holy like the Lord.
[698.00 → 700.00] There is no one besides you.
[700.00 → 704.00] There is no rock like our God.
[704.00 → 709.00] So as God has called us, He has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[709.00 → 712.00] Please turn to your neighbours and greet one another.
[712.00 → 713.00] Amen.
[713.00 → 714.00] Amen.
[714.00 → 715.00] Amen.
[715.00 → 716.00] Amen.
[716.00 → 717.00] Amen.
[717.00 → 718.00] Amen.
[718.00 → 719.00] Amen.
[719.00 → 720.00] Amen.
[720.00 → 721.00] Amen.
[721.00 → 722.00] Amen.
[722.00 → 723.00] Amen.
[723.00 → 724.00] Amen.
[724.00 → 725.00] Amen.
[725.00 → 726.00] Amen.
[726.00 → 731.00] Amen.
[731.00 → 732.00] Amen.
[732.00 → 735.00] Amen.
[735.00 → 736.00] Amen.
[736.00 → 738.00] Amen.
[738.00 → 739.00] Amen.
[739.00 → 739.18] Amen.
[739.18 → 746.00] Amen.
[746.00 → 747.22] Amen.
[747.22 → 748.22] Amen.
[748.22 → 749.22] Amen.
[749.84 → 751.66] Amen.
[751.66 → 754.10] Amen.
[754.10 → 754.96] Amen.
[754.96 → 762.64] Almighty King, help us thy name to sing.
[762.64 → 766.50] Help us to praise.
[767.00 → 781.62] Father all-glorious, for all-victorious, come and reign over us, ancient of days.
[781.62 → 797.78] Come thou incarnate word, gird on thy mighty sword, scatter thy foes.
[797.78 → 805.54] Let thy mighty aid, our sure defence be made.
[805.86 → 812.62] Our souls on thee be stayed, thy wonders show.
[812.62 → 830.62] Come, holy Comforter, thy sacred witness bear in this glad heart.
[830.62 → 845.98] Thou who almighty art, rule now in every heart, and there from us depart, Spirit of power.
[845.98 → 875.96] To thee, great one and three, eternal praises be.
[875.96 → 879.96] Hence evermore.
[880.96 → 888.58] Thy sovereign majesty may we in glory see.
[888.58 → 896.34] And to eternity love and adore.
[905.96 → 931.28] You're the word of God the Father, from before the world began.
[931.28 → 940.28] Every star and every planet has been fashioned by your hand.
[940.28 → 949.28] All creation holds together by the power of your voice.
[949.28 → 954.28] Let the skies declare your glory.
[954.28 → 958.28] Let the land and seas rejoice.
[958.28 → 962.28] You're the author of creation.
[962.28 → 966.28] You're the Lord of everyone.
[966.28 → 975.28] And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[975.28 → 985.28] Yet you left the gaze of angels, came to seek and save the lost.
[985.28 → 994.28] And exchange the joy of heaven for the anguish of a cross.
[994.28 → 995.28] With a prayer you fed the hungry.
[995.28 → 999.28] With a prayer you fed the hungry.
[999.28 → 1003.28] With a word you called the sea.
[1003.28 → 1011.28] Yet how silently you suffered, that the guilty may go free.
[1011.28 → 1012.28] You're the author of creation.
[1012.28 → 1013.28] You're the Lord of everyone.
[1013.28 → 1026.28] And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[1026.28 → 1027.28] With a shout you rose victorious.
[1027.28 → 1028.28] With a shout you rose victorious.
[1028.28 → 1029.28] Resting victory from the grave.
[1029.28 → 1030.28] And ascended into heaven.
[1030.28 → 1031.28] Leading captives in your way.
[1031.28 → 1032.28] Now you stand before the Father.
[1032.28 → 1033.28] Interceding for your own.
[1033.28 → 1034.28] From each tribe and town and nation.
[1034.28 → 1037.28] You are leading sinners home.
[1037.28 → 1045.28] and ascended into heaven, leading captives in your way.
[1046.28 → 1054.52] Now you stand before the Father, interceding for your own.
[1055.00 → 1063.28] From each tribe and town and nation, you are leading sinners home.
[1063.28 → 1072.06] You're the author of creation. You're the Lord of every world.
[1072.52 → 1079.82] And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[1080.58 → 1081.54] Please be seated.
[1081.54 → 1083.54] Thank you.
[1083.54 → 1084.54] Thank you.
[1088.54 → 1092.32] Our next song, Saviour, Like a Shepherd Lead Us,
[1092.58 → 1095.62] is a favourite Christian hymn written by Dorothy Thru pp,
[1095.82 → 1098.06] who lived in London in 1836.
[1098.86 → 1104.04] It portrays our Saviour offering guidance and care to his flock, including ourselves.
[1104.04 → 1108.68] Blessed Jesus, much we need your tender care.
[1109.50 → 1112.42] Blessed Jesus, you have bought us, yours we are.
[1113.38 → 1115.96] Blessed Jesus, early let us turn to you.
[1116.76 → 1119.72] Blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray.
[1120.74 → 1123.56] Blessed Jesus, you have loved us, love us still.
[1124.40 → 1126.80] Please reflect on the words as we sing.
[1126.80 → 1141.54] Blessed Jesus, you have loved us, yours we are.
[1141.54 → 1152.32] Saviour, like a shepherd lead us, much we need your tender care.
[1152.32 → 1163.32] In your pleasant pastures feed us, for our useful prepare.
[1165.32 → 1176.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have bought us, yours we are.
[1176.94 → 1190.14] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have bought us, yours we are.
[1191.94 → 1198.20] We are yours in love, befriend us.
[1198.62 → 1201.94] Be the guardian of our way.
[1201.94 → 1210.40] Keep your flock from sin, defend us.
[1210.80 → 1214.94] Seek us when we go astray.
[1214.94 → 1226.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray.
[1226.94 → 1239.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray.
[1239.94 → 1240.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray.
[1240.94 → 1253.94] You have promised to receive us, poor and sinful though we be.
[1253.94 → 1265.94] You have mercy to receive us, praise to cleanse and power to free.
[1265.94 → 1277.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, early let us turn to you.
[1277.94 → 1291.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, early let us turn to you.
[1291.94 → 1305.94] Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, holy let us turn to you.
[1305.94 → 1310.58] So part of our weekly worship rhythm is to have a time of confession.
[1311.54 → 1313.72] Now you may be wondering why we do this.
[1313.80 → 1318.10] Why do we have this time of confession in the course of our worship?
[1318.10 → 1323.02] And is it because we're staunchly reformed Christians who like to think about sin?
[1324.30 → 1326.64] Or is it because we're trying to be trendy?
[1327.68 → 1328.32] Well, no.
[1328.46 → 1333.70] Actually, it's because confession is a pattern that we see in God's word.
[1334.74 → 1341.22] And if you read the Psalms, there are so many moments when God's people need to be drawn into confession
[1341.22 → 1345.48] for all the ways that they have wandered away from him.
[1345.48 → 1352.04] And so today we'll be using Psalm 81 as our confession this morning.
[1352.20 → 1356.62] And I will read this portion of Psalm 81 for us.
[1357.18 → 1360.54] And then we will take moments of silence to reflect on God's word.
[1361.26 → 1365.70] So as I read, I want to invite you, you can either just follow along on the screen as I read.
[1365.78 → 1369.56] Or if you want, you can close your eyes and pray and listen prayerfully.
[1370.02 → 1371.60] So however you'd like to do it.
[1371.60 → 1374.30] But here is Psalm 81.
[1375.48 → 1380.74] Hear me, my people, and I will warn you.
[1381.52 → 1387.66] If you would only listen to me, Israel, you shall have no foreign God among you.
[1388.92 → 1393.76] You shall not worship any God other than me.
[1393.76 → 1400.38] I am the Lord your God who brought you up out of Egypt.
[1401.54 → 1405.52] Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
[1405.52 → 1410.48] But my people would not listen to me.
[1410.48 → 1414.20] Israel would not submit to me.
[1414.84 → 1420.16] So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.
[1420.16 → 1423.74] If my people would only listen to me.
[1423.74 → 1427.04] If Israel would only follow my ways.
[1427.38 → 1433.14] How quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.
[1433.14 → 1436.44] You would be fed with the finest of wheat.
[1437.04 → 1440.52] With honey from the rock, I would satisfy you.
[1440.52 → 1448.86] So let's take a moment of silence now and ask God for his forgiving mercy in our lives.
[1449.24 → 1452.02] For his Holy Spirit to heal and to renew us.
[1452.02 → 1452.52] Amen.
[1452.52 → 1453.52] Amen.
[1453.52 → 1454.02] Amen.

[1499.50 → 1511.10] you say would you listen to me and Lord we confess that we stop up our ears we harden our hearts and
[1511.10 → 1520.66] Lord we often fail to submit to your word so Lord for these things we are truly sorry and we humbly
[1520.66 → 1531.44] repent but Lord we thank you that you never forsake us but Lord you continue to pursue us you continue
[1531.44 → 1537.88] to draw us to yourself in your love so Lord we thank you for your grace that is so far deeper and
[1537.88 → 1546.48] beyond our sin your grace that calls us to yourself and so Lord we do come we ask that you would renew
[1546.48 → 1553.12] us renew our hearts give us ears to hear and obey give us hearts Lord to trust in you again we pray
[1553.12 → 1560.54] in Jesus name amen children of God please rise in body or in spirit as you are able to hear these
[1560.54 → 1570.04] words of assurance spoken over you from Ephesians chapter 2 for it is by grace you have been saved
[1570.04 → 1578.02] through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of God not by works so that no one can
[1578.02 → 1587.32] boast of we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance
[1587.32 → 1594.30] for us to do thanks be to God let's sing our next song I am not my own
[1594.30 → 1624.28] this only comfort in my life and in my death you have fully paid for all my sins
[1624.28 → 1638.28] and all my debts even when I struggle to be me with your precious blood you set me free
[1638.28 → 1665.28] I am not my own but belong body and soul in my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[1665.28 → 1680.28] you preserve my life in such a way that without you not a hair can fall from me unless you will it too
[1680.28 → 1687.28] even when I'm lost in desperation all things work together for my salvation
[1687.28 → 1708.28] all things work together for my salvation I am not my own but belong body and soul in my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[1708.28 → 1715.28] always by your Holy Spirit you assure me of eternal life and make me willing and ready
[1715.28 → 1722.28] even when I can't see my way through
[1722.28 → 1729.28] from now on to always live for you
[1729.28 → 1745.28] from now on to always live for you
[1745.28 → 1752.28] from now on to always live for you, I am not my own but belong body and soul in my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[1752.28 → 1773.28] I am not my own but belong body and soul in my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[1773.28 → 1796.28] I am not my own but belong body and soul in my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[1796.28 → 1818.28] and so at this time the children are dismissed to go to their classes and this is one combined class for the summer months age 3 through grade 1
[1818.28 → 1823.76] So as the children leave, let's prepare our hearts to hear God's Word
[1839.24 → 1841.80] I'll be reading from Acts 13
[1842.56 → 1844.56] 42 to 52
[1844.56 → 1849.04] You'll find it on your pew Bibles on page 822
[1853.36 → 1856.58] As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue
[1856.58 → 1861.32] The people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath
[1862.10 → 1864.10] When the congregation was dismissed
[1865.32 → 1870.38] Many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas
[1870.38 → 1875.58] Who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God
[1875.58 → 1881.64] On the next Sabbath, most of the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord
[1881.64 → 1885.72] When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy
[1885.72 → 1891.34] They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him
[1891.34 → 1895.44] Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly
[1895.44 → 1899.92] We had to speak to the word of God to you first
[1899.92 → 1905.42] Since you rejected it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life
[1905.42 → 1907.90] We now turn to the Gentiles
[1907.90 → 1910.92] For this is what the Lord has commanded us
[1910.92 → 1914.76] I have made you a light for the Gentiles
[1914.76 → 1918.50] That you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth
[1918.50 → 1924.00] When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honoured the word of the Lord
[1924.00 → 1927.62] And all who were appointed for eternal life believed
[1927.62 → 1931.08] The word of the Lord spread through the whole region
[1931.08 → 1936.52] But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standard
[1936.52 → 1938.30] And the leading men of the city
[1938.30 → 1941.98] They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas
[1941.98 → 1943.96] And expelled them from their region
[1943.96 → 1948.80] So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them
[1948.80 → 1950.44] And went to Iconium
[1950.44 → 1955.04] And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit
[1955.04 → 1957.14] This is the word of the Lord
[1957.14 → 1959.08] Thanks be to God
[1959.08 → 1980.74] All right, let's pray together
[1980.74 → 1985.24] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word
[1985.24 → 1988.30] We thank you that your word is true
[1988.30 → 1991.56] And that you give it to us, Lord, because you love us
[1991.56 → 1994.64] And Lord, would you open our eyes this morning
[1994.64 → 1996.12] To see Jesus
[1996.12 → 1998.54] To grow as his disciples
[1998.54 → 2002.64] And Lord, would you make me this morning a messenger of your peace
[2002.64 → 2005.16] We pray in Jesus' name, amen
[2005.16 → 2010.42] So if you spend any time with animals
[2010.42 → 2013.42] Maybe you have a dog or a cat at home
[2013.42 → 2015.88] Or I know for some of you dairy farmers
[2015.88 → 2017.84] You spend a lot of time with cows, of course
[2017.84 → 2020.88] And when you spend time with animals
[2020.88 → 2024.76] You come to realize that animals have personalities
[2024.76 → 2027.80] Right, and they're similar to people in this way
[2027.80 → 2031.14] They have all kinds of different and diverse personalities
[2031.14 → 2037.20] Well, apparently moose also have different personalities
[2037.20 → 2040.58] So I heard this story about a moose encounter
[2040.58 → 2044.84] And it's told by a pastor who moved to Alaska
[2044.84 → 2046.52] To pastor a church there
[2046.52 → 2050.24] And one of the things he said about learning to live in Alaska
[2050.24 → 2054.74] Is learning how to interact with and how to deal with moose
[2054.74 → 2057.94] Especially trying to keep them out of your summer garden
[2057.94 → 2060.56] So his family got a dog
[2060.56 → 2065.52] And that dog would just bark and bark whenever a moose wandered into the yard
[2065.52 → 2069.20] And he noticed that these moose have these different personalities
[2069.20 → 2076.20] That you can see on display in how they respond to the dog barking at them
[2076.20 → 2077.64] And trying to chase them out of the yard
[2077.64 → 2082.16] So a number of these moose are skittish
[2082.16 → 2085.44] And they just run off quickly once the dog starts barking
[2085.44 → 2089.84] Other kinds of moose don't care, right
[2089.84 → 2092.18] They just stand their ground, oblivious
[2092.18 → 2095.38] They ignore you, just like, you know, whatever, I'm bigger
[2095.38 → 2096.94] And that's that
[2096.94 → 2101.30] But apparently there is a third kind of moose
[2101.30 → 2105.18] So this pastor hears his dog barking late one night
[2105.18 → 2107.24] And it just won't stop barking
[2107.24 → 2110.12] And he goes out to the front porch
[2110.12 → 2114.22] And the moose is standing right there next to the house
[2114.22 → 2117.08] It was so close he could reach over the rail of the porch
[2117.08 → 2118.04] And touch the animal
[2118.04 → 2120.78] And he said it was actually on the smaller side
[2120.78 → 2121.88] It was kind of cute and fluffy
[2121.88 → 2125.96] But, you know, he wanted to move it along and shoo it away
[2125.96 → 2127.46] And so he yelled at it
[2127.46 → 2128.90] And tried to get it to move
[2128.90 → 2130.44] But it just wasn't moving
[2130.44 → 2132.16] It wasn't listening at all
[2132.16 → 2137.20] In fact, he said it had a look of defiance in its cute face
[2137.20 → 2139.84] And so he picked up his snow shovel
[2139.84 → 2142.08] Which I guess, even in the summer, you have handy
[2142.08 → 2145.56] And he very gently nudged it
[2145.56 → 2145.92] Right?
[2146.14 → 2149.14] Just tried to get the animal to respond, to move
[2149.14 → 2151.76] And this cute, fluffy moose
[2151.76 → 2153.60] Whipped around in an instant
[2153.60 → 2156.16] And started kicking the side of the house
[2156.16 → 2159.62] So he says, now, if you go to visit his house
[2159.62 → 2161.40] There are dents in the side of the house
[2161.40 → 2164.02] From where this moose kicked it
[2164.02 → 2167.82] The reason I'm telling you this story
[2167.82 → 2170.50] Is that just as there are different reactions
[2170.50 → 2174.12] That moose will have to being shooed out of a yard
[2174.12 → 2176.76] What we see in our passage today
[2176.76 → 2179.12] Is that there are different reactions
[2179.12 → 2181.68] And responses that people have
[2181.68 → 2184.24] To the preaching of the word of God
[2184.24 → 2186.58] So over the last few weeks
[2186.58 → 2189.36] We have been following Paul and Barnabas
[2189.36 → 2191.56] On their first missionary journey
[2191.56 → 2194.80] They were, if you remember, they were sent out
[2194.80 → 2197.22] By the church in Antioch, right?
[2198.06 → 2200.72] And even though that church was a new church
[2200.72 → 2203.66] It could have greatly benefited from Paul and Barnabas
[2203.66 → 2206.24] Staying there and helping to minister
[2206.24 → 2207.66] And build up the church
[2207.66 → 2210.96] But in obedience to the Holy Spirit
[2210.96 → 2213.14] They sent them, the church
[2213.14 → 2215.86] They sent Paul and Barnabas out on mission
[2215.86 → 2218.76] This missionary journey to bring the gospel
[2218.76 → 2221.96] To places that had not yet heard of Jesus Christ
[2221.96 → 2226.24] So after stopping first on the island of Cyprus
[2226.24 → 2228.90] They travel to Pistoia, Antioch
[2228.90 → 2230.88] North in modern day Turkey
[2230.88 → 2232.74] And on the Sabbath
[2232.74 → 2234.16] As we saw last week
[2234.16 → 2235.10] Paul and Barnabas
[2235.10 → 2236.54] They go into the synagogue
[2236.54 → 2240.64] Where Paul stands and gives an exhortation
[2240.64 → 2243.60] And he preaches his first sermon
[2243.60 → 2248.26] So now, what we see in our passage today
[2248.26 → 2250.88] Is what happens
[2250.88 → 2253.46] What are the different responses
[2253.46 → 2255.68] To the preaching of the word of God
[2255.68 → 2256.58] From Paul
[2256.58 → 2259.30] How did people receive the message of the gospel?
[2259.56 → 2261.30] What was the response?
[2262.30 → 2263.98] Well, one response that we see
[2263.98 → 2266.96] Is the response of hostility
[2266.96 → 2267.94] Right?
[2268.02 → 2269.68] They shoo Paul and Barnabas
[2269.68 → 2270.72] Right out of town
[2270.72 → 2273.86] But the other response we find
[2273.86 → 2275.26] Is not hostility
[2275.26 → 2276.24] But hospitality
[2276.24 → 2278.26] Some people receive
[2278.26 → 2281.48] Generously receive the word of God
[2281.48 → 2282.52] With joy
[2282.52 → 2283.92] They honour the word of God
[2283.92 → 2285.04] And they believe
[2285.04 → 2286.44] They put their trust in Christ
[2286.44 → 2289.84] But even more than just
[2289.84 → 2292.84] Luke recording these different responses
[2292.84 → 2294.86] Luke, who is the author of Acts
[2294.86 → 2296.92] He actually sheds some light
[2296.92 → 2298.58] On why
[2298.58 → 2300.92] Why do people respond
[2300.92 → 2302.12] In the ways that they do?
[2302.40 → 2304.24] Why do some people reject the gospel?
[2304.82 → 2307.54] Why do other people accept it?
[2308.30 → 2309.82] And that's what I want to look at this morning
[2309.82 → 2311.10] Okay, just those two points
[2311.10 → 2313.78] So first, let's look at this response first
[2313.78 → 2315.36] Of hostility
[2315.36 → 2319.46] When the gospel spread all around that city
[2319.46 → 2323.26] The Jewish community became angry
[2323.26 → 2325.84] They rejected the message
[2325.84 → 2327.90] That Jesus is the Messiah
[2327.90 → 2329.76] They taught against it
[2329.76 → 2331.92] They rallied influential women
[2331.92 → 2333.02] And men in the city
[2333.02 → 2334.52] Against Paul and Barnabas
[2334.52 → 2335.74] And they drove them out of town
[2335.74 → 2336.40] Right?
[2336.44 → 2337.72] That's the response of hostility
[2337.72 → 2341.54] And so the question is
[2341.54 → 2342.78] Why?
[2342.94 → 2343.08] Right?
[2343.14 → 2345.00] What's all this hostility about?
[2345.54 → 2347.20] And there are two main reasons
[2347.20 → 2348.66] For rejecting the gospel
[2348.66 → 2350.48] That we see in our passage today
[2350.48 → 2352.16] So let's see what it says
[2352.16 → 2354.74] Beginning in verse 42
[2354.74 → 2357.20] And this week will have a lot of scripture
[2357.20 → 2358.36] Up on the screen for us
[2358.36 → 2359.84] You can follow along there
[2359.84 → 2360.52] Or in your Bibles
[2360.52 → 2362.78] So starting in verse 42 again
[2362.78 → 2365.16] As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue
[2365.16 → 2367.72] The people invited them to speak further
[2367.72 → 2369.52] About these things on the next Sabbath
[2369.52 → 2372.50] When the congregation was dismissed
[2372.50 → 2374.20] Many of the Jews
[2374.20 → 2376.14] And devout converts to Judaism
[2376.14 → 2378.42] Followed Paul and Barnabas
[2378.42 → 2379.88] Who talked with them
[2379.88 → 2380.64] And urged them
[2380.64 → 2381.64] To continue
[2381.64 → 2383.46] In the grace of God
[2383.46 → 2385.64] On the next Sabbath
[2385.64 → 2386.90] Almost
[2386.90 → 2388.20] The whole
[2388.20 → 2389.30] City
[2389.30 → 2390.50] Gathered
[2390.50 → 2392.18] To hear the word of the Lord
[2392.18 → 2392.98] Wouldn't that be amazing?
[2394.34 → 2394.70] Imagine
[2394.70 → 2396.06] All of Ladder
[2396.06 → 2396.74] Just coming
[2396.74 → 2397.74] Streaming in
[2397.74 → 2400.14] When the Jews
[2400.14 → 2401.16] Saw the crowds
[2401.16 → 2402.22] They were filled with what?
[2403.46 → 2404.10] Jealousy
[2404.10 → 2407.24] They were jealous
[2407.24 → 2409.18] And that's the word Luke chooses
[2409.18 → 2410.94] To describe what is going on here
[2410.94 → 2413.06] Now for one
[2413.06 → 2415.22] This is not a Jewish town
[2415.22 → 2415.60] Right?
[2416.20 → 2417.06] They're not
[2417.06 → 2418.38] They're in a Gentile area
[2418.38 → 2419.40] They're in Turkey
[2419.40 → 2421.34] A long way from Jerusalem
[2421.34 → 2422.82] A long way from the Holy Land
[2422.82 → 2424.98] And each Sabbath
[2424.98 → 2426.78] The Jews of the city
[2426.78 → 2428.60] The Diaspora Jews
[2428.60 → 2429.42] Who had spread out
[2429.42 → 2430.70] All around the Roman Empire
[2430.70 → 2431.66] They would gather
[2431.66 → 2432.58] Wherever they lived
[2432.58 → 2433.24] In the synagogue
[2433.24 → 2434.48] And they would hear
[2434.48 → 2435.36] The scriptures read
[2435.36 → 2435.98] And they would pray
[2435.98 → 2437.16] And they would worship their God
[2437.16 → 2440.24] But it doesn't really attract
[2440.24 → 2441.10] Many converts
[2441.10 → 2442.26] Right?
[2442.44 → 2444.40] It's only going to grow
[2444.40 → 2446.96] When another Jewish person
[2446.96 → 2448.50] Moves to the city
[2448.50 → 2450.82] And I was thinking
[2450.82 → 2451.34] This is something
[2451.34 → 2452.54] That we need to take away from
[2452.54 → 2453.30] From this
[2453.30 → 2454.16] Right?
[2454.62 → 2455.12] Is that
[2455.12 → 2456.44] We don't want to be
[2456.44 → 2457.16] Like a synagogue
[2457.16 → 2458.30] For diaspora Jews
[2458.30 → 2458.66] Do we?
[2459.20 → 2459.40] Right?
[2459.42 → 2460.18] We don't want it to be
[2460.18 → 2461.38] That we only grow
[2461.38 → 2462.72] And add to our numbers
[2462.72 → 2463.82] If someone
[2463.82 → 2465.30] From a Christian
[2465.30 → 2466.50] Reformed background
[2466.50 → 2467.36] Moves to Ladder
[2467.36 → 2468.20] And decides to worship
[2468.20 → 2468.92] With us
[2468.92 → 2470.08] Right?
[2470.44 → 2472.02] That's not a good growth model
[2472.02 → 2473.88] We need to be reaching out
[2473.88 → 2475.16] To all kinds of people
[2475.16 → 2476.44] In our city
[2476.44 → 2477.76] Sharing Jesus with them
[2477.76 → 2478.94] And we're doing that
[2478.94 → 2479.92] So this is great
[2479.92 → 2482.40] But that's the situation
[2482.40 → 2484.14] With this Jewish synagogue
[2484.14 → 2485.56] But then Paul
[2485.56 → 2486.38] Comes along
[2486.38 → 2487.32] This visiting
[2487.32 → 2488.20] You know
[2488.20 → 2488.58] Rabbi
[2488.58 → 2490.32] And he preaches
[2490.32 → 2491.04] That Jesus
[2491.04 → 2492.00] Is the Messiah
[2492.00 → 2493.12] He is the one
[2493.12 → 2493.96] Who can set us
[2493.96 → 2495.06] Free from sin
[2495.06 → 2496.76] And suddenly
[2496.76 → 2498.04] This message
[2498.04 → 2498.60] Of the gospel
[2498.60 → 2499.82] Is just drawing
[2499.82 → 2501.54] This huge response
[2501.54 → 2502.78] Crowds of people
[2502.78 → 2504.16] Responding to the message
[2504.16 → 2504.62] Of Paul
[2504.62 → 2506.24] And when Paul
[2506.24 → 2506.84] And Barnabas
[2506.84 → 2507.86] Come to the synagogue
[2507.86 → 2508.88] On the next Sunday
[2508.88 → 2510.38] To preach again
[2510.38 → 2510.94] The people just
[2510.94 → 2512.16] Can't get enough preaching
[2512.16 → 2513.10] I know what it's like
[2513.10 → 2517.30] But the whole city comes
[2517.30 → 2518.14] They gather
[2518.14 → 2519.46] To hear the word of the Lord
[2519.46 → 2522.26] People who had never
[2522.26 → 2523.16] In their lives
[2523.16 → 2524.22] Ever set foot
[2524.22 → 2525.16] In a synagogue before
[2525.16 → 2527.10] They're flocking in
[2527.10 → 2529.08] So the Jews are jealous
[2529.08 → 2531.16] Of the kind of receptivity
[2531.16 → 2532.06] In the community
[2532.06 → 2533.92] And that's understandable
[2533.92 → 2534.28] Right?
[2534.54 → 2535.30] I mean we get jealous
[2535.30 → 2536.62] If someone has what we want
[2536.62 → 2537.80] Or they're doing well
[2537.80 → 2538.48] Well we feel like
[2538.48 → 2538.90] Why aren't
[2538.90 → 2539.12] You know
[2539.12 → 2540.04] Why do I have that?
[2540.20 → 2540.86] So we understand
[2540.86 → 2543.44] But I think what's really
[2543.44 → 2545.10] Bothering the Jews of Antioch
[2545.10 → 2545.94] Isn't so much
[2545.94 → 2547.00] That Paul is drawing
[2547.00 → 2547.52] A crowd
[2547.52 → 2548.28] That he's popular
[2548.28 → 2549.72] Rather
[2549.72 → 2551.20] What is bothering them
[2551.20 → 2552.62] Is Paul's teaching
[2552.62 → 2554.74] Because notice what it says
[2554.74 → 2555.50] In verse 45
[2555.50 → 2557.42] They began
[2557.42 → 2558.62] To contradict
[2558.62 → 2559.88] What Paul was saying
[2559.88 → 2561.34] And heaped abuse
[2561.34 → 2562.10] On him
[2562.10 → 2563.92] In other words
[2563.92 → 2565.54] They were contradicting
[2565.54 → 2566.76] The message of the gospel
[2566.76 → 2567.66] Right?
[2567.72 → 2568.14] That's what
[2568.14 → 2569.16] That's what the real
[2569.16 → 2570.28] Problem is here
[2570.28 → 2571.42] They didn't mind
[2571.42 → 2572.36] If Gentiles
[2572.36 → 2573.26] Sat in the back
[2573.26 → 2573.84] Of their synagogue
[2573.84 → 2575.24] Right?
[2575.28 → 2575.88] They didn't mind
[2575.88 → 2576.64] If the Gentiles
[2576.64 → 2577.28] Came in
[2577.28 → 2578.94] Accepted their teaching
[2578.94 → 2580.48] And eventually
[2580.48 → 2582.22] Became good Jews
[2582.22 → 2583.10] Through circumcision
[2583.10 → 2584.16] That would have been
[2584.16 → 2584.88] Fine with them
[2584.88 → 2586.42] Similarly
[2586.42 → 2587.30] We don't mind
[2587.30 → 2587.92] If Baptists
[2587.92 → 2588.76] And Pentecostals
[2588.76 → 2589.72] Come and worship
[2589.72 → 2590.32] With us
[2590.32 → 2591.34] As long as they
[2591.34 → 2591.84] Become good
[2591.84 → 2592.54] Reformed Christians
[2592.54 → 2592.76] Right?
[2592.76 → 2595.82] But what the Jews
[2595.82 → 2596.92] Didn't want
[2596.92 → 2598.12] Was the Gentiles
[2598.12 → 2598.86] Being received
[2598.86 → 2599.46] By God
[2599.46 → 2600.44] As Gentiles
[2600.44 → 2601.46] Right?
[2601.52 → 2602.26] What bothered them
[2602.26 → 2602.82] Greatly
[2602.82 → 2603.46] Was the idea
[2603.46 → 2603.96] That God
[2603.96 → 2604.66] Would love
[2604.66 → 2605.62] Gentiles
[2605.62 → 2606.70] That God
[2606.70 → 2607.24] Would consider
[2607.24 → 2607.92] Gentiles
[2607.92 → 2608.42] To be
[2608.42 → 2609.06] Their
[2609.06 → 2609.98] Equal
[2609.98 → 2611.96] They were
[2611.96 → 2612.70] Offended
[2612.70 → 2613.96] That God
[2613.96 → 2614.54] Would even
[2614.54 → 2615.14] Extend
[2615.14 → 2615.92] His grace
[2615.92 → 2616.82] And his love
[2616.82 → 2618.26] To anybody
[2618.26 → 2619.72] Even Baptists
[2619.72 → 2620.46] And Pentecostals
[2620.46 → 2622.54] And that was
[2622.54 → 2623.04] The message
[2623.04 → 2623.78] That Paul preached
[2623.78 → 2624.24] Wasn't it?
[2624.86 → 2625.10] Right?
[2625.16 → 2625.92] In verse 39
[2625.92 → 2626.70] Which we saw
[2626.70 → 2627.34] From Paul's sermon
[2627.34 → 2627.94] Last week
[2627.94 → 2628.92] This is what he says
[2628.92 → 2629.66] Through him
[2629.66 → 2630.88] In Jesus
[2630.88 → 2633.06] Everyone who believes
[2633.06 → 2634.10] Is set free
[2634.10 → 2635.34] From every sin
[2635.34 → 2636.54] A justification
[2636.54 → 2637.88] You are not able
[2637.88 → 2638.42] To obtain
[2638.42 → 2639.14] Under the law
[2639.14 → 2639.76] Of Moses
[2639.76 → 2641.10] Friends
[2641.10 → 2641.60] That's the message
[2641.60 → 2642.14] Of the gospel
[2642.14 → 2644.46] Everyone who believes
[2644.46 → 2644.92] In Jesus
[2644.92 → 2646.32] Is able to stand
[2646.32 → 2647.30] Before God
[2647.30 → 2648.06] As if they had
[2648.06 → 2649.00] Never sinned
[2649.00 → 2650.50] They are able
[2650.50 → 2651.64] To stand before God
[2651.64 → 2651.98] How?
[2652.24 → 2653.80] Apart from the law
[2653.80 → 2654.86] They don't have
[2654.86 → 2655.34] To obey
[2655.34 → 2656.16] All the law
[2656.16 → 2657.78] They can stand
[2657.78 → 2658.38] Before God
[2658.38 → 2659.22] Without having
[2659.22 → 2660.38] Kept any of it
[2660.38 → 2662.72] And this is
[2662.72 → 2663.80] Deeply insulting
[2663.80 → 2664.96] To the Jews
[2664.96 → 2665.76] It means that
[2665.76 → 2666.46] God only demands
[2666.46 → 2667.08] One thing
[2667.08 → 2667.32] Right?
[2667.64 → 2668.52] What does God demand?
[2669.38 → 2669.84] Only
[2669.84 → 2671.46] Our desperate need
[2671.46 → 2673.18] That's it
[2673.18 → 2673.86] The recognition
[2673.86 → 2674.94] That I have got
[2674.94 → 2675.38] Nothing
[2675.38 → 2677.12] Nothing in my hands
[2677.12 → 2677.56] I bring
[2677.56 → 2678.78] Simply to
[2678.78 → 2679.60] Thy cross
[2679.60 → 2680.66] I cling
[2680.66 → 2680.92] Right?
[2680.96 → 2681.82] I bring nothing
[2681.82 → 2684.48] But the Jews
[2684.48 → 2685.36] Brought the idea
[2685.36 → 2686.84] We are the favourite
[2686.84 → 2687.26] Of God
[2687.26 → 2688.16] Right?
[2688.22 → 2688.74] We've got more
[2688.74 → 2689.40] Righteousness
[2689.40 → 2690.72] Than anyone else
[2690.72 → 2691.96] Because they were
[2691.96 → 2692.76] So committed
[2692.76 → 2693.58] To the law
[2693.58 → 2694.72] As the marker
[2694.72 → 2695.96] By which they were
[2695.96 → 2697.50] God's chosen people
[2697.50 → 2701.46] And here are all
[2701.46 → 2702.46] Of these
[2702.46 → 2704.82] Immoral
[2704.82 → 2706.58] Pagans
[2706.58 → 2707.72] Pagan Gentiles
[2707.72 → 2710.10] Being received
[2710.10 → 2710.82] By God
[2710.82 → 2711.68] Right?
[2711.76 → 2712.70] So they were jealous
[2712.70 → 2713.30] They were jealous
[2713.30 → 2714.32] Of their own standing
[2714.32 → 2715.14] Before God
[2715.14 → 2715.54] On
[2715.54 → 2717.76] Only on the terms
[2717.76 → 2718.98] That they had long
[2718.98 → 2719.66] Believed in
[2719.66 → 2721.30] And this tendency
[2721.30 → 2722.40] This tendency
[2722.40 → 2722.96] That we have
[2722.96 → 2724.04] To self-righteousness
[2724.04 → 2725.18] Is something
[2725.18 → 2725.64] That I think
[2725.64 → 2726.26] We struggle
[2726.26 → 2726.86] With as well
[2726.86 → 2727.22] Today
[2727.22 → 2728.46] Just as much
[2728.46 → 2729.32] As the Jews
[2729.32 → 2730.02] Did in Paul's
[2730.02 → 2730.28] Time
[2730.28 → 2732.18] And so the biggest
[2732.18 → 2733.22] Problem in the church
[2733.22 → 2733.66] Today
[2733.66 → 2734.14] You know
[2734.14 → 2734.78] It's not
[2734.78 → 2735.94] Sexual immorality
[2735.94 → 2737.78] The biggest problem
[2737.78 → 2738.36] In the church
[2738.36 → 2738.70] Today
[2738.70 → 2740.04] Is self-righteousness
[2740.04 → 2741.26] Of people
[2741.26 → 2741.90] Who consider
[2741.90 → 2742.68] Themselves
[2742.68 → 2743.12] Better
[2743.12 → 2743.88] Than those
[2743.88 → 2744.12] Who are
[2744.12 → 2744.80] Sexually immoral
[2744.80 → 2747.90] The message
[2747.90 → 2748.54] Of the gospel
[2748.54 → 2750.26] Is that the problem
[2750.26 → 2752.34] With the church
[2752.34 → 2752.78] The problem
[2752.78 → 2753.24] With the world
[2753.24 → 2753.64] Is what?
[2754.72 → 2755.22] Me
[2755.22 → 2756.68] The problem
[2756.68 → 2757.18] Is me
[2757.18 → 2757.64] Right?
[2758.26 → 2759.50] God have mercy
[2759.50 → 2760.70] On me
[2760.70 → 2762.32] That's the posture
[2762.32 → 2762.78] Of a Christian
[2762.78 → 2763.90] I'm the big sinner
[2763.90 → 2765.76] And I'm accepted
[2765.76 → 2766.24] By God
[2766.24 → 2767.08] Only by what
[2767.08 → 2767.72] Christ has done
[2767.72 → 2768.12] For me
[2768.12 → 2770.28] I came across
[2770.28 → 2771.14] A quote this week
[2771.14 → 2773.00] From Eugene Peterson
[2773.00 → 2774.52] Which I thought
[2774.52 → 2775.48] Fit very well
[2775.48 → 2776.32] He said this
[2776.32 → 2778.20] Every congregation
[2778.20 → 2779.10] Is a congregation
[2779.10 → 2779.90] Of sinners
[2779.90 → 2781.70] As if that wasn't
[2781.70 → 2782.28] Bad enough
[2782.28 → 2784.02] They all have
[2784.02 → 2785.34] Sinners for pastors
[2785.34 → 2787.90] Yes
[2787.90 → 2789.32] Yes
[2789.32 → 2791.62] But you know what
[2791.62 → 2792.14] The Jews
[2792.14 → 2793.26] Wouldn't stand it
[2793.26 → 2794.86] They didn't want
[2794.86 → 2795.54] To be set free
[2795.54 → 2796.00] From Jesus
[2796.00 → 2796.92] Apart from the law
[2796.92 → 2798.52] So they drove
[2798.52 → 2799.00] The apostles
[2799.00 → 2799.54] Out of town
[2799.54 → 2800.42] You know
[2800.42 → 2800.90] And sometimes
[2800.90 → 2801.56] Churches too
[2801.56 → 2802.74] They want to drive
[2802.74 → 2803.36] That message
[2803.36 → 2804.28] Out of town as well
[2804.28 → 2806.56] So that's the first
[2806.56 → 2807.78] Reason for the reaction
[2807.78 → 2808.54] Of hostility
[2808.54 → 2809.24] It's this problem
[2809.24 → 2809.86] Of jealousy
[2809.86 → 2811.32] But the second
[2811.32 → 2812.38] Reason we see here
[2812.38 → 2813.96] Is actually
[2813.96 → 2815.76] This was God's plan
[2815.76 → 2817.88] This was God's plan
[2817.88 → 2819.14] And we see that
[2819.14 → 2820.04] In Paul and Barnabas
[2820.04 → 2821.56] Is their response
[2821.56 → 2822.36] So
[2822.36 → 2824.34] Look at verse 46
[2824.34 → 2827.84] Paul and Barnabas
[2827.84 → 2828.84] Answered them boldly
[2828.84 → 2830.24] We had to speak
[2830.24 → 2830.26] We had to speak
[2830.26 → 2831.04] The word of God
[2831.04 → 2831.92] To you first
[2831.92 → 2834.02] Since you reject it
[2834.02 → 2835.14] And do not consider
[2835.14 → 2835.96] Yourselves worthy
[2835.96 → 2836.84] Of eternal life
[2836.84 → 2838.04] We now turn
[2838.04 → 2838.88] To the Gentiles
[2838.88 → 2841.16] He's essentially saying
[2841.16 → 2843.12] We needed to preach
[2843.12 → 2844.44] To you Jews first
[2844.44 → 2845.18] But
[2845.18 → 2846.70] As expected
[2846.70 → 2848.18] Most of you
[2848.18 → 2848.70] Won't listen
[2848.70 → 2850.16] Right
[2850.16 → 2851.30] Remember
[2851.30 → 2852.76] Paul himself
[2852.76 → 2854.60] Is a Jewish
[2854.60 → 2855.16] Rabbi
[2855.16 → 2857.22] He is a Pharisee
[2857.22 → 2858.26] He is the Pharisee
[2858.26 → 2859.34] Of Pharisees
[2859.34 → 2860.56] He is the ultimate
[2860.56 → 2861.74] Insider actually
[2861.74 → 2863.26] He is one
[2863.26 → 2864.30] Of them
[2864.30 → 2866.20] And now
[2866.20 → 2867.52] As an apostle
[2867.52 → 2868.48] Having met the risen
[2868.48 → 2868.90] Christ
[2868.90 → 2870.04] He recognizes
[2870.04 → 2870.78] That the Jewish
[2870.78 → 2872.04] Rejection of Jesus
[2872.04 → 2873.84] Was all a part
[2873.84 → 2875.24] Of God's plan
[2875.24 → 2877.70] Described in prophecy
[2877.70 → 2879.06] Hundreds of years
[2879.06 → 2879.62] Previously
[2879.62 → 2881.58] We can look at
[2881.58 → 2882.32] So many different
[2882.32 → 2883.18] Passages of scripture
[2883.18 → 2884.20] From the Old Testament
[2884.20 → 2885.36] But I'll just share
[2885.36 → 2886.00] One example
[2886.00 → 2887.58] Psalm 118
[2887.58 → 2888.80] 22 to 23
[2888.80 → 2890.74] The stone
[2890.74 → 2891.60] That the builders
[2891.60 → 2892.46] Rejected
[2892.46 → 2893.72] Has become
[2893.72 → 2894.54] The cornerstone
[2894.54 → 2895.84] This is the
[2895.84 → 2896.54] Lord's doing
[2896.54 → 2897.58] It is marvellous
[2897.58 → 2898.60] In our eyes
[2898.60 → 2899.96] Right
[2899.96 → 2900.70] Isn't that amazing
[2900.70 → 2902.52] Way back
[2902.52 → 2903.32] In the Psalms
[2903.32 → 2904.46] Not only
[2904.46 → 2905.54] Was it foretold
[2905.54 → 2906.10] That Jesus
[2906.10 → 2907.18] Our cornerstone
[2907.18 → 2908.02] Would be rejected
[2908.02 → 2909.74] But that this
[2909.74 → 2910.96] Was the Lord's
[2910.96 → 2911.32] Doing
[2911.32 → 2912.48] Right
[2912.48 → 2913.28] Don't miss that
[2913.28 → 2914.64] The stone
[2914.64 → 2915.14] The builders
[2915.14 → 2915.74] Rejected
[2915.74 → 2916.22] Has become
[2916.22 → 2916.98] The cornerstone
[2916.98 → 2918.28] This is the
[2918.28 → 2919.10] Lord's doing
[2919.10 → 2919.96] Right
[2919.96 → 2920.48] This is all
[2920.48 → 2921.16] Part of God's
[2921.16 → 2921.44] Plan
[2921.44 → 2922.84] And the
[2922.84 → 2923.32] Apostles
[2923.32 → 2923.92] Preach this
[2923.92 → 2924.80] All the time
[2924.80 → 2925.90] And I want
[2925.90 → 2926.40] To just show
[2926.40 → 2927.26] You this thread
[2927.26 → 2928.00] That is running
[2928.00 → 2928.42] Through the
[2928.42 → 2929.12] Book of Acts
[2929.12 → 2930.20] Okay
[2930.20 → 2930.52] So
[2930.52 → 2931.80] Acts chapter 2
[2931.80 → 2932.46] Verse 23
[2932.46 → 2932.96] The apostle
[2932.96 → 2933.90] Peter is preaching
[2933.90 → 2934.84] This man
[2934.84 → 2935.20] Jesus
[2935.20 → 2935.72] Was handed
[2935.72 → 2936.58] Over to you
[2936.58 → 2937.94] By God's
[2937.94 → 2938.56] Deliberate
[2938.56 → 2938.98] Plan
[2938.98 → 2939.38] And for
[2939.38 → 2939.84] Knowledge
[2939.84 → 2942.36] Chapter 3
[2942.36 → 2943.18] Verse 17
[2943.18 → 2943.98] Now
[2943.98 → 2944.88] Fellow Israelites
[2944.88 → 2945.54] I know
[2945.54 → 2945.92] That you
[2945.92 → 2946.42] Acted in
[2946.42 → 2946.84] Ignorance
[2946.84 → 2947.30] As did
[2947.30 → 2947.78] Your leaders
[2947.78 → 2948.56] But this
[2948.56 → 2949.00] Is how
[2949.00 → 2949.78] God fulfilled
[2949.78 → 2950.34] What he
[2950.34 → 2951.34] Had foretold
[2951.34 → 2952.22] Through all
[2952.22 → 2952.80] The prophets
[2952.80 → 2953.44] Saying
[2953.44 → 2954.12] That his
[2954.12 → 2954.50] Messiah
[2954.50 → 2954.74] Would
[2954.74 → 2955.62] Suffer
[2955.62 → 2958.10] Chapter 4
[2958.10 → 2959.18] Verse 27
[2959.18 → 2960.32] Herod and
[2960.32 → 2961.02] Pontius Pilate
[2961.02 → 2961.70] Met together
[2961.70 → 2962.12] With the
[2962.12 → 2962.66] Gentiles
[2962.66 → 2963.24] And the
[2963.24 → 2963.72] People of
[2963.72 → 2964.02] Israel
[2964.02 → 2964.46] In the
[2964.46 → 2964.78] City
[2964.78 → 2965.26] To
[2965.26 → 2965.98] Conspire
[2965.98 → 2966.52] Against
[2966.52 → 2967.12] Your holy
[2967.12 → 2967.44] Servant
[2967.44 → 2967.80] Jesus
[2967.80 → 2968.38] Whom
[2968.38 → 2968.58] You
[2968.58 → 2969.00] Anointed
[2969.00 → 2969.84] They
[2969.84 → 2970.30] Did
[2970.30 → 2971.46] What
[2971.46 → 2971.96] Your
[2971.96 → 2972.38] Power
[2972.38 → 2973.04] And
[2973.04 → 2973.42] Will
[2973.42 → 2973.82] Had
[2973.82 → 2974.40] Decided
[2974.40 → 2975.40] Beforehand
[2975.40 → 2975.66] Should
[2975.66 → 2976.08] Happen
[2976.08 → 2977.68] And then
[2977.68 → 2978.10] In our
[2978.10 → 2978.50] Passage
[2978.50 → 2979.08] Last week
[2979.08 → 2979.62] In Paul's
[2979.62 → 2979.90] Sermon
[2979.90 → 2980.68] Verse 27
[2980.68 → 2982.60] Paul says
[2982.60 → 2983.12] The people
[2983.12 → 2983.74] Of Jerusalem
[2983.74 → 2984.24] And their
[2984.24 → 2984.78] Rulers
[2984.78 → 2985.14] Did not
[2985.14 → 2985.64] Recognize
[2985.64 → 2986.10] Jesus
[2986.10 → 2986.60] Yet
[2986.60 → 2986.90] In
[2986.90 → 2987.32] Condemning
[2987.32 → 2987.52] Them
[2987.52 → 2987.70] They
[2987.70 → 2988.22] Fulfilled
[2988.22 → 2988.66] The words
[2988.66 → 2988.88] Of the
[2988.88 → 2989.40] Prophets
[2989.40 → 2990.02] That are
[2990.02 → 2990.32] Read
[2990.32 → 2991.12] Every
[2991.12 → 2992.24] Sabbath
[2992.24 → 2993.86] They
[2993.86 → 2994.06] Kept
[2994.06 → 2994.38] Saying
[2994.38 → 2994.44] They
[2994.44 → 2994.46] Kept
[2994.46 → 2994.48] Saying
[2994.48 → 2994.60] These
[2994.60 → 2994.86] Kinds
[2994.86 → 2994.96] Of
[2994.96 → 2995.28] Things
[2995.28 → 2995.64] Over
[2995.64 → 2995.82] And
[2995.82 → 2996.00] Over
[2996.00 → 2996.40] Again
[2996.40 → 2998.22] That not
[2998.22 → 2998.62] Only
[2998.62 → 2998.86] Did
[2998.86 → 2999.54] God
[2999.54 → 2999.80] Didn't
[2999.80 → 2999.98] Just
[2999.98 → 3000.48] Peek
[3000.48 → 3000.66] Into
[3000.66 → 3000.84] The
[3000.84 → 3001.22] Future
[3001.22 → 3001.52] To
[3001.52 → 3001.78] See
[3001.78 → 3002.36] What
[3002.36 → 3002.70] People
[3002.70 → 3002.90] Were
[3002.90 → 3003.14] Going
[3003.14 → 3003.30] To
[3003.30 → 3003.66] Do
[3003.66 → 3004.20] No
[3004.20 → 3004.44] He
[3004.44 → 3005.06] Planned
[3005.06 → 3005.36] It
[3005.36 → 3006.58] Jesus
[3006.58 → 3006.94] Didn't
[3006.94 → 3007.22] Come
[3007.22 → 3007.40] To
[3007.40 → 3007.76] Earth
[3007.76 → 3008.62] Hoping
[3008.62 → 3008.84] That
[3008.84 → 3009.02] The
[3009.02 → 3009.28] Jews
[3009.28 → 3009.46] Would
[3009.46 → 3009.78] Accept
[3009.78 → 3010.06] Him
[3010.06 → 3011.40] So
[3011.40 → 3011.56] That
[3011.56 → 3011.70] He
[3011.70 → 3011.84] Could
[3011.84 → 3012.10] Then
[3012.10 → 3012.78] Set
[3012.78 → 3012.94] Up
[3012.94 → 3013.06] An
[3013.06 → 3013.38] Earthly
[3013.38 → 3013.68] Kingdom
[3013.68 → 3013.88] And
[3013.88 → 3014.06] Kick
[3014.06 → 3014.20] Out
[3014.20 → 3014.36] The
[3014.36 → 3014.66] Romans
[3014.66 → 3015.48] No
[3015.48 → 3015.66] He
[3015.66 → 3015.94] Came
[3015.94 → 3016.10] To
[3016.10 → 3016.58] Suffer
[3016.58 → 3016.90] And
[3016.90 → 3017.32] Die
[3017.32 → 3018.06] To
[3018.06 → 3018.28] Bring
[3018.28 → 3018.84] Salvation
[3018.84 → 3019.06] To
[3019.06 → 3019.32] All
[3019.32 → 3019.68] People
[3019.68 → 3021.14] And
[3021.14 → 3021.32] So
[3021.32 → 3021.52] In
[3021.52 → 3021.68] This
[3021.68 → 3022.12] Reaction
[3022.12 → 3022.30] Of
[3022.30 → 3022.74] Hostility
[3022.74 → 3022.92] To
[3022.92 → 3023.04] The
[3023.04 → 3023.38] Gospel
[3023.38 → 3024.04] God
[3024.04 → 3024.22] Is
[3024.22 → 3024.64] Fulfilling
[3024.64 → 3024.82] The
[3024.82 → 3025.12] Plan
[3025.12 → 3025.30] That
[3025.30 → 3025.50] He
[3025.50 → 3025.82] Had
[3025.82 → 3026.04] All
[3026.04 → 3026.40] Along
[3026.40 → 3027.64] It
[3027.64 → 3027.94] It's
[3027.94 → 3028.56] Tragic
[3028.56 → 3028.70] In
[3028.70 → 3028.90] Many
[3028.90 → 3029.34] Ways
[3029.34 → 3030.32] But
[3030.32 → 3030.52] It's
[3030.52 → 3031.28] Comforting
[3031.28 → 3031.86] To
[3031.86 → 3032.08] Know
[3032.08 → 3032.28] That
[3032.28 → 3032.64] None
[3032.64 → 3032.80] Of
[3032.80 → 3032.94] This
[3032.94 → 3033.08] Was
[3033.08 → 3033.38] Outside
[3033.38 → 3033.62] The

[3033.86 → 3034.02] Of
[3034.02 → 3034.38] God's
[3034.38 → 3034.76] Purpose
[3034.76 → 3034.96] And
[3034.96 → 3035.28] God's
[3035.28 → 3035.60] Plan
[3035.60 → 3037.34] Then
[3037.34 → 3037.58] What
[3037.58 → 3037.74] Is
[3037.74 → 3037.94] This
[3037.94 → 3038.30] Plan
[3038.30 → 3039.28] We
[3039.28 → 3039.50] See
[3039.50 → 3039.62] It
[3039.62 → 3039.68] In
[3039.68 → 3039.78] The
[3039.78 → 3039.98] Next
[3039.98 → 3040.24] Verse
[3040.24 → 3040.34] In

[3040.76 → 3040.94] Verse
[3040.94 → 3041.48] 47
[3041.48 → 3042.64] Here's
[3042.64 → 3042.74] The
[3042.74 → 3042.96] Plan
[3042.96 → 3043.10] Of
[3043.10 → 3043.38] God
[3043.38 → 3044.26] For
[3044.26 → 3044.48] This
[3044.48 → 3044.62] Is
[3044.62 → 3044.78] What
[3044.78 → 3044.90] The
[3044.90 → 3045.08] Lord
[3045.08 → 3045.24] Has
[3045.24 → 3045.68] Commanded
[3045.68 → 3045.92] Us
[3045.92 → 3046.30] I
[3046.30 → 3046.50] Have
[3046.50 → 3046.74] Made
[3046.74 → 3046.86] You
[3046.86 → 3047.02] A

[3047.22 → 3047.40] For
[3047.40 → 3047.56] The
[3047.56 → 3048.18] Gentiles
[3048.18 → 3048.76] That
[3048.76 → 3048.94] You
[3048.94 → 3049.08] May
[3049.08 → 3049.28] Bring
[3049.28 → 3049.30].
[3049.30 → 3049.84] Salvation
[3049.84 → 3050.68] To
[3050.68 → 3050.88] The
[3050.88 → 3051.34] Ends
[3051.34 → 3051.52] Of
[3051.52 → 3051.64] The
[3051.64 → 3051.96] Earth
[3051.96 → 3053.44] God's
[3053.44 → 3053.64] Plan
[3053.64 → 3053.84] Has
[3053.84 → 3054.22] Always
[3054.22 → 3054.42] Been
[3054.42 → 3054.56] That
[3054.56 → 3054.74] His

[3055.18 → 3055.40] Is
[3055.40 → 3055.66] For
[3055.66 → 3055.90] The
[3055.90 → 3056.20] Whole
[3056.20 → 3056.64] World
[3056.64 → 3057.96] So
[3057.96 → 3058.28] Although
[3058.28 → 3058.50] The
[3058.50 → 3058.82] Gospel
[3058.82 → 3059.08] Was
[3059.08 → 3059.54] Proclaimed
[3059.54 → 3059.70] To
[3059.70 → 3059.86] The
[3059.86 → 3060.06] Jews
[3060.06 → 3060.50] First
[3060.50 → 3060.90] And
[3060.90 → 3061.16] Jesus
[3061.16 → 3061.58] Said
[3061.58 → 3061.92] You
[3061.92 → 3062.04] Will
[3062.04 → 3062.14] Be

[3062.76 → 3062.92] In
[3062.92 → 3063.38] Jerusalem
[3063.38 → 3063.56] And

[3064.88 → 3064.98] Of
[3064.98 → 3065.08] The

[3065.40 → 3066.48] But
[3066.48 → 3066.70] Even
[3066.70 → 3066.88] Though
[3066.88 → 3067.02] The
[3067.02 → 3067.34] Gospel
[3067.34 → 3067.60] Was

[3068.44 → 3068.76] First
[3068.76 → 3069.04] Also
[3069.04 → 3069.20] As
[3069.20 → 3069.54] Romans
[3069.54 → 3070.20] Paul
[3070.20 → 3070.40] Says
[3070.40 → 3070.72] Romans
[3070.72 → 3071.02] 1
[3071.02 → 3072.54] It
[3072.54 → 3072.66] Is
[3072.66 → 3072.90] Not
[3072.90 → 3073.38] Only
[3073.38 → 3073.90] For
[3073.90 → 3074.12] The
[3074.12 → 3074.48] Jews
[3074.48 → 3075.12] It

[3227.60 → 3227.96] People
[3227.96 → 3228.38] Hear
[3228.38 → 3228.56] The
[3228.56 → 3228.92] Gospel
[3228.92 → 3229.36] They
[3229.36 → 3229.70] Receive
[3229.70 → 3229.82] It
[3229.82 → 3230.32] Gladly
[3230.32 → 3230.88] It's
[3230.88 → 3231.06] Not
[3231.06 → 3231.34] Because
[3231.34 → 3231.50] Of
[3231.50 → 3231.62] Their
[3231.62 → 3231.82] Own
[3231.82 → 3232.12] Goodness
[3232.12 → 3232.70] It's
[3232.70 → 3232.90] Not
[3232.90 → 3233.30] Because
[3233.30 → 3233.62] They
[3233.62 → 3234.26] Have
[3234.26 → 3234.72] Greater
[3234.72 → 3235.30] Spiritual
[3235.30 → 3236.10] Sensitivity
[3236.10 → 3237.26] It's
[3237.26 → 3237.54] Not
[3237.54 → 3238.08] Because
[3238.08 → 3238.24] Of
[3238.24 → 3238.66] Anything
[3238.66 → 3238.94] In
[3238.94 → 3239.40] Themselves
[3239.40 → 3239.62] But
[3239.62 → 3240.06] Only
[3240.06 → 3240.56] Because
[3240.56 → 3240.72] Of
[3240.72 → 3241.22] God's
[3241.22 → 3241.66] Sovereign
[3241.66 → 3242.80] Election
[3242.80 → 3244.50] It's
[3244.50 → 3244.68] Like
[3244.68 → 3244.92] Our
[3244.92 → 3245.56] Response
[3245.56 → 3245.74] Of
[3245.74 → 3246.02] Joy
[3246.02 → 3246.20] At
[3246.20 → 3246.42] Hearing
[3246.42 → 3246.60] The
[3246.60 → 3246.92] Gospel
[3246.92 → 3247.24] It's
[3247.24 → 3247.46] Much
[3247.46 → 3247.80] More
[3247.80 → 3248.34] Like
[3248.34 → 3248.52] A
[3248.52 → 3248.90] King
[3248.90 → 3249.50] Choosing
[3249.50 → 3249.78] His
[3249.78 → 3250.80] Subjects
[3250.80 → 3251.04] Than
[3251.04 → 3251.18] It
[3251.18 → 3251.36] Is
[3251.36 → 3251.48] A
[3251.48 → 3251.84] Democratic
[3251.84 → 3252.32] Country
[3252.32 → 3252.74] Electing
[3252.74 → 3252.88] A
[3252.88 → 3253.26] President
[3253.26 → 3255.00] And
[3255.00 → 3255.16] So
[3255.16 → 3255.40] Friends
[3255.40 → 3255.76] Whether
[3255.76 → 3256.52] Jew
[3256.52 → 3256.90] Or
[3256.90 → 3257.56] Gentile
[3257.56 → 3258.00] Right
[3258.00 → 3258.14] It's
[3258.14 → 3258.30] Not
[3258.30 → 3258.54] Which
[3258.54 → 3259.06] Paul
[3259.06 → 3259.56] Went
[3259.56 → 3259.72] From
[3259.72 → 3259.86] The
[3259.86 → 3260.16] Jews
[3260.16 → 3260.34] And
[3260.34 → 3260.44] Then
[3260.44 → 3260.60] Just
[3260.60 → 3260.82] Cut
[3260.82 → 3260.96] Them
[3260.96 → 3261.12] Off
[3261.12 → 3261.22] And
[3261.22 → 3261.28] Went
[3261.28 → 3261.38] To
[3261.38 → 3261.48] The
[3261.48 → 3261.96] Gentiles
[3261.96 → 3262.22] No
[3262.22 → 3262.60] The
[3262.60 → 3262.98] Gentiles
[3262.98 → 3263.14] Were
[3263.14 → 3263.60] Added
[3263.60 → 3263.92] In
[3263.92 → 3264.06] It's
[3264.06 → 3264.22] For
[3264.22 → 3264.72] Everybody
[3264.72 → 3265.04] Jew
[3265.04 → 3265.24] And
[3265.24 → 3265.72] Gentile
[3265.72 → 3267.62] Male
[3267.62 → 3268.02] And
[3268.02 → 3268.42] Female
[3268.42 → 3268.80] Rich
[3268.80 → 3269.10] And
[3274.68 → 3275.48] He
[3275.48 → 3275.60] Will
[3275.60 → 3275.82] Bring
[3275.82 → 3276.08] Them
[3276.08 → 3276.66] Into
[3276.66 → 3276.96] His
[3276.96 → 3277.32] Kingdom
[3277.32 → 3278.58] You
[3278.58 → 3278.72] Know
[3278.72 → 3279.18] But
[3279.18 → 3279.36] You
[3279.36 → 3279.42] Know
[3279.42 → 3279.66] This
[3279.66 → 3280.10] Idea
[3280.10 → 3280.38] Right
[3280.38 → 3280.60] That
[3280.60 → 3281.24] God
[3281.24 → 3281.52] Is
[3281.52 → 3281.96] Ultimately
[3281.96 → 3282.28] In
[3282.28 → 3282.68] Control
[3282.68 → 3283.00] Of

[3283.36 → 3283.64] People
[3283.64 → 3283.98] Are
[3283.98 → 3285.14] It's
[3285.14 → 3285.36] Something
[3285.36 → 3285.58] That
[3285.58 → 3285.70] We
[3285.70 → 3286.08] Find
[3286.08 → 3286.58] All
[3286.58 → 3286.96] Throughout
[3286.96 → 3287.20] The
[3287.20 → 3287.34] New
[3287.34 → 3287.74] Testament
[3287.74 → 3288.72] And
[3288.72 → 3289.04] Jesus
[3289.04 → 3289.62] Himself
[3289.62 → 3289.84] He
[3289.84 → 3290.28] Keeps
[3290.28 → 3290.78] Saying
[3290.78 → 3291.14] These
[3291.14 → 3291.52] Kinds
[3291.52 → 3291.64] Of

[3298.30 → 3298.48] One
[3298.48 → 3298.68] Can
[3298.68 → 3298.94] Come
[3298.94 → 3299.14] To
[3299.14 → 3299.44] Me

[3327.30 → 3327.60] Not
[3327.60 → 3328.18] Believe
[3328.18 → 3329.00] Because
[3329.00 → 3329.42] You

[3346.38 → 3346.54] Of
[3346.54 → 3346.90] Election
[3346.90 → 3347.44] Is
[3347.44 → 3347.74] Often
[3347.74 → 3348.00] A
[3348.00 → 3348.46] Difficult
[3348.46 → 3348.82] Idea
[3348.82 → 3349.02] For

[3387.76 → 3388.22] And
[3388.22 → 3389.08] Gentiles
[3389.08 → 3391.00] And
[3391.00 → 3391.48] It's
[3391.48 → 3391.82] Interesting
[3391.82 → 3392.26] Because
[3392.26 → 3392.54] Some
[3392.54 → 3392.92] People
[3392.92 → 3393.22] Have
[3393.22 → 3393.38] This

[3393.94 → 3394.22] Jerk
[3394.22 → 3394.76] Reaction

[3395.40 → 3395.56] They're
[3395.56 → 3395.72] Like
[3395.72 → 3396.08] If
[3396.08 → 3396.24] This
[3396.24 → 3397.02] Is
[3397.02 → 3397.22] True
[3397.22 → 3397.44] If
[3397.44 → 3397.78] God
[3397.78 → 3398.70] Appoints
[3398.70 → 3399.22] Those
[3399.22 → 3399.70] To
[3399.70 → 3400.04] Eternal
[3400.04 → 3400.32] Life
[3400.32 → 3400.44] Who
[3400.44 → 3400.90] Believe
[3400.90 → 3402.84] Why
[3402.84 → 3403.10] Even
[3403.10 → 3403.38] Bother
[3403.38 → 3404.24] Like
[3404.24 → 3404.42] What's
[3404.42 → 3404.54] The
[3404.54 → 3404.76] Point
[3404.76 → 3405.00] Why
[3405.00 → 3406.06] Bother

[3406.90 → 3407.20] Why

[3407.58 → 3408.22] Preaching
[3408.22 → 3408.46] The
[3408.46 → 3408.80] Gospel
[3408.80 → 3409.76] Why
[3409.76 → 3410.32] Bother
[3410.32 → 3410.56] Getting
[3410.56 → 3410.94] Involved
[3410.94 → 3411.06] In
[3411.06 → 3411.30] Mission
[3411.30 → 3411.68] Work
[3411.68 → 3413.42] Well I
[3413.42 → 3413.56] Think
[3413.56 → 3413.70] There
[3413.70 → 3413.82] Are
[3413.82 → 3413.94] A

[3414.52 → 3414.78] Ways
[3414.78 → 3414.94] To
[3414.94 → 3415.16] Answer
[3415.16 → 3415.36] That
[3415.36 → 3415.80] Question
[3415.80 → 3416.62] But
[3416.62 → 3416.76] We
[3416.76 → 3416.92] Can
[3416.92 → 3417.34] Begin
[3417.34 → 3417.68] By
[3417.68 → 3418.12] Pointing
[3418.12 → 3418.28] To
[3418.28 → 3418.54] Paul
[3418.54 → 3419.02] Himself
[3419.02 → 3420.24] The

[3420.76 → 3421.30] Missionary
[3421.30 → 3421.62] That
[3421.62 → 3422.36] I
[3422.36 → 3422.54] Can

[3424.86 → 3425.80] And
[3425.80 → 3426.08] Paul
[3426.08 → 3426.74] Clearly
[3426.74 → 3427.38] Had
[3427.38 → 3427.54] A
[3427.54 → 3428.14] Passion
[3428.14 → 3428.94] For
[3428.94 → 3429.12] The

[3429.54 → 3431.26] And
[3431.26 → 3431.58] He's
[3431.58 → 3431.72] The
[3431.72 → 3431.92] One
[3431.92 → 3432.22] Saying
[3432.22 → 3432.50] These
[3432.50 → 3432.92] Things
[3432.92 → 3434.26] You

[3441.14 → 3441.32] Look
[3441.32 → 3441.44] At
[3441.68 → 3442.66] Paul
[3442.66 → 3442.94] Says
[3442.94 → 3443.10] This
[3443.10 → 3443.24] Is
[3443.24 → 3443.40] My
[3443.40 → 3443.82] Gospel
[3443.82 → 3444.50] For
[3444.50 → 3444.76] Which
[3444.76 → 3445.08] I
[3445.08 → 3445.32] Am
[3445.32 → 3445.96] Suffering
[3445.96 → 3446.32] Even
[3446.32 → 3446.52] To
[3446.52 → 3446.64] The
[3446.64 → 3446.84] Point
[3446.84 → 3446.96] Of
[3446.96 → 3447.10] Being
[3447.10 → 3447.40] Chained
[3447.40 → 3447.58] Like
[3447.58 → 3447.70] A
[3447.70 → 3448.02] Criminal
[3448.02 → 3448.76] But
[3448.76 → 3449.08] God's
[3449.08 → 3449.26] Word
[3449.26 → 3449.40] Is
[3449.40 → 3449.62] Not
[3449.62 → 3450.06] Chained
[3450.06 → 3450.74] Therefore
[3450.74 → 3451.28] I
[3451.28 → 3451.80] Endure
[3451.80 → 3452.48] Everything

[3455.84 → 3456.02] The
[3456.02 → 3456.46] Salvation
[3456.46 → 3456.72] That
[3456.72 → 3456.84] Is
[3456.84 → 3456.96] In
[3456.96 → 3457.16] Christ
[3457.16 → 3457.62] Jesus
[3457.62 → 3459.90] Right
[3459.90 → 3460.20] Remember
[3460.20 → 3460.54] Paul

[3465.62 → 3465.76] In
[3465.76 → 3466.04] Prison
[3466.04 → 3467.22] But
[3467.22 → 3467.38] The
[3467.38 → 3467.68] Spirit
[3467.68 → 3468.18] Worked
[3468.18 → 3468.28] In
[3468.28 → 3468.56] Paul's
[3468.56 → 3468.78] Heart
[3468.78 → 3469.54] The
[3469.54 → 3469.92] Spirit
[3469.92 → 3470.98] Humbled
[3470.98 → 3471.38] Him
[3471.38 → 3471.78] And
[3471.78 → 3471.90] The
[3471.90 → 3472.12] Spirit
[3472.12 → 3472.94] Aligned

[3473.92 → 3474.30] With
[3474.30 → 3474.60] His
[3474.60 → 3474.90] Own
[3474.90 → 3475.22] Heart
[3475.22 → 3475.78] God's

[3477.56 → 3477.78] Save
[3477.78 → 3477.96] The

[3481.38 → 3481.58] Holy
[3481.58 → 3482.00] Spirit
[3482.00 → 3483.02] So
[3483.02 → 3483.34] Much
[3483.34 → 3483.54] So
[3483.54 → 3483.70] That
[3483.70 → 3483.88] He
[3483.88 → 3484.06] Was
[3484.06 → 3484.78] Willing
[3484.78 → 3485.56] To

[3485.86 → 3486.26] Thrown
[3486.26 → 3486.44] In
[3486.44 → 3486.74] Prison
[3486.74 → 3487.38] Himself
[3487.38 → 3488.52] For
[3488.52 → 3488.66] The

[3489.04 → 3489.20] Of
[3489.20 → 3490.12] Evangelism
[3490.12 → 3490.82] So

[3491.26 → 3491.96] The
[3491.96 → 3492.30] Gospel
[3492.30 → 3492.52] Would

[3492.64 → 3493.14] Proclaimed
[3493.14 → 3494.54] Right
[3494.54 → 3494.74] So
[3494.74 → 3495.04] Paul
[3495.04 → 3495.32] Held
[3495.32 → 3495.52] These
[3495.52 → 3495.68] Two
[3495.68 → 3495.88] Things
[3495.88 → 3496.04] In
[3496.04 → 3496.34] Tension
[3496.34 → 3497.24] Preaching
[3497.24 → 3497.42] The
[3497.42 → 3497.56] Word
[3497.56 → 3497.70] Of

[3499.28 → 3500.62] Trusting
[3500.62 → 3500.80] That
[3500.80 → 3501.14] God
[3501.14 → 3501.34] Would

[3506.12 → 3506.44] Did
[3506.44 → 3506.64] This
[3506.64 → 3507.04] Because
[3507.04 → 3507.28] He
[3507.28 → 3507.48] Knew
[3507.48 → 3507.70] That
[3507.70 → 3507.94] God

[3512.00 → 3512.32] They
[3512.32 → 3512.46] Would
[3512.46 → 3512.60] Be
[3512.60 → 3513.00] Saved

[3517.24 → 3517.36] I

[3517.82 → 3518.00] This
[3518.00 → 3518.50] Recently
[3518.50 → 3518.82] But
[3518.82 → 3519.90] It's
[3519.90 → 3520.00] An
[3520.00 → 3520.26] Important
[3520.26 → 3520.72] Passage
[3520.72 → 3520.88] Here
[3520.88 → 3520.96] It

[3525.86 → 3525.98] Be
[3525.98 → 3526.30] Saved
[3526.30 → 3526.78] That's
[3526.78 → 3526.86] The
[3526.86 → 3527.32] Invitation
[3527.32 → 3528.56] How

[3531.90 → 3532.08] Can
[3532.08 → 3532.22] They
[3532.22 → 3532.64] Believe
[3532.64 → 3532.82] In

[3533.60 → 3533.76] Not
[3533.76 → 3534.10] Heard
[3534.10 → 3534.54] How
[3534.54 → 3534.72] Can
[3534.72 → 3534.86] They
[3534.86 → 3535.26] Hear
[3535.26 → 3535.58] Without

[3538.02 → 3538.24] Them
[3538.24 → 3539.16] This

[3903.16 → 3904.34] Shining
[3904.34 → 3905.56] Jesus
[3905.56 → 3906.82] Light

[3926.38 → 3926.80] Shine
[3926.80 → 3927.88] Jesus
[3927.88 → 3929.18] Shine
[3929.18 → 3930.20] Build
[3930.20 → 3930.84] This

[3952.70 → 3956.00] With grace and mercy
[3956.00 → 3959.70] Send forth your word
[3959.70 → 3966.42] Lord, and let there be light
[3966.42 → 3973.52] Lord, I come to your awesome presence
[3973.52 → 3978.98] From the shadows into your radiance
[3978.98 → 3984.16] By the blood I may enter your brightness
[3984.16 → 3989.74] Search me, try me, consume all my darkness

[4040.46 → 4047.98] As we gaze on your kingly brightness
[4047.98 → 4053.64] So our faces display your likeness
[4053.64 → 4058.98] Ever changing from glory to glory
[4058.98 → 4064.40] Mirrored here may our lives tell your story
[4064.40 → 4068.40] Shine on me

[4104.36 → 4109.14] Send forth your word
[4109.14 → 4113.78] Lord, and let there be light
[4113.78 → 4126.88] Well, that was a throwback, right?
[4126.96 → 4128.22] I haven't sung that song in a long time.
[4128.22 → 4130.28] And actually, you know, some good lyrics.
[4131.10 → 4131.86] So that's great.
[4133.28 → 4139.32] We continue to respond to God's word this morning by offering ourselves back to him.
[4140.42 → 4142.36] Him who gave himself for us.
[4142.36 → 4148.30] And one of the ways we do this is by giving of our resources back to God for the work of his church.
[4148.96 → 4153.86] And as we do so, we also trust that through the work of the Holy Spirit,
[4155.14 → 4161.16] that he will use our offerings far beyond even their worldly value.
[4162.24 → 4165.54] Our designated offering this Sunday is for Abba Canada.
[4166.06 → 4171.10] And they are a ministry that gives financial assistance to Christian families adopting children,
[4171.10 → 4174.02] both locally and internationally, as it says there.
[4174.38 → 4177.68] So may I ask the deacons to come and collect the offering?
[4177.68 → 4207.02] A
[4207.68 → 4228.88] Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[4228.88 → 4247.88] Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[4247.88 → 4263.88] Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[4263.88 → 4281.88] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and renew a right spirit within me.
[4281.88 → 4299.88] Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[4299.88 → 4316.88] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and renew a right spirit within me.
[4316.88 → 4333.44] So let's now go before the Lord in prayer, bringing our concerns and bringing our needs to him.
[4334.48 → 4335.64] Please join me in prayer.
[4337.24 → 4346.08] O merciful and gracious Lord, you open your loving hands, and you bless us abundantly every day of our lives.
[4346.88 → 4349.82] We thank you, and we praise you for your goodness to us.
[4350.92 → 4359.32] And Lord, even when we go through dark times, through suffering, sorrow, pain, and desperation,
[4360.24 → 4365.18] Lord, you assure us that you're loving, everlasting arms will never let me go.
[4365.42 → 4367.58] Lord, you are always holding on to us.
[4368.08 → 4376.28] Lord, how generous is your amazing grace, and how comforting is the promise of your love and your presence with us always.
[4376.88 → 4385.32] And Lord, we especially pray for your love and your presence in your grace in the lives of people in our congregation.
[4386.10 → 4392.44] Lord, we pray for Tony Bento, who was admitted to the hospital earlier this week.
[4392.44 → 4397.06] And Lord, he's been there for quite a long time now already.
[4397.32 → 4403.56] And we ask, Lord, that you would grant wisdom to the doctors.
[4404.28 → 4412.90] Lord, help them find out what is going on and what is troubling him and what is giving him his health problems.
[4412.90 → 4416.88] And Lord, would you especially draw close to him.
[4417.68 → 4422.16] Lord, would you assure him deep in his heart and his mind, Lord, that he belongs to you.
[4422.68 → 4429.90] And Lord, that even as he goes through trials, Lord, that your promises are still ever, ever true.
[4429.90 → 4437.14] Lord, we also pray similarly for Annette Vermeer, who had her foot operation this week.
[4437.62 → 4440.48] Lord, we pray for a speedy recovery.
[4441.52 → 4446.14] Lord, help her, because it's on her foot, to be able to regain her confidence in walking.
[4447.38 → 4450.98] And Lord, as she looks to the future, would you continue to guide her and give her wisdom.
[4450.98 → 4455.90] Lord, we also lift to you Amy Iron.
[4456.84 → 4465.60] And Lord, as she is just continuing to face serious health challenges, Lord, we ask for your healing hand upon her.
[4466.22 → 4473.38] And Lord, we ask that you would strengthen Amy herself in her spirit, in her inner being.
[4473.82 → 4478.06] And also, Lord, all those who, family and friends, all those who love her.
[4478.46 → 4480.38] Lord, would you be the God of comfort.
[4480.38 → 4482.48] Lord, would you be the God of healing power.
[4483.94 → 4488.42] Lord, we pray also, Lord, for our church.
[4489.20 → 4493.38] We pray that you would continue to be at work by your spirit.
[4493.82 → 4497.78] Lord, this is not the work of men and women, but the work of your spirit.
[4499.12 → 4504.86] Use us, Lord, as a light in this community, because it is not our church, it is your church.
[4505.76 → 4507.76] And Lord, you are the one who loves us.
[4507.76 → 4515.28] And we know that you will continue to draw us to yourself and use us for your glory.
[4515.28 → 4522.64] So we pray this morning that you would help us to be a church that embodies your hospitality and your welcome.
[4523.36 → 4533.00] That we would be a church that faithfully proclaims the gospel, both inside these doors and outside these doors in our relationships and our community.
[4533.00 → 4538.90] Lord, we pray that you would use us for your glory and the good of your people.
[4539.46 → 4543.68] Lord, transform our lives and transform the lives of those around us.
[4543.80 → 4545.66] We ask all of this in Jesus' name.
[4546.18 → 4546.46] Amen.
[4546.46 → 4551.00] It's been a joy to worship with you this morning.
[4551.18 → 4558.64] I ask you to stand and receive God's good words spoken over you.
[4559.72 → 4561.32] I invite you to hold out your hands.
[4563.16 → 4572.00] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all now and forever.
[4572.70 → 4573.10] Amen.
[4573.68 → 4581.82] So right after we sing our final song, I invite all of us, all of you, to join us for a time of fellowship right through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[4581.82 → 4605.70] Now blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel.
[4605.70 → 4618.32] For he alone does wondrous works, his glorious deeds excel.
[4620.20 → 4631.66] For he alone does wondrous works, his glorious deeds excel.
[4631.66 → 4643.34] And blessed be his glorious name through all eternity.
[4645.34 → 4657.50] The whole earth let his glory fill, amen, so shall it be.
[4657.50 → 4671.50] The whole earth let his glory fill, amen, so shall it be.
