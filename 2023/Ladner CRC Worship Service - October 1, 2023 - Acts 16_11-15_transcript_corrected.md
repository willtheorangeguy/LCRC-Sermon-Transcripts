[576.00 → 578.00] Thank you.
[578.00 → 580.00] Thank you.
[580.00 → 582.00] Thank you.
[582.00 → 584.00] Thank you.
[584.00 → 586.00] Please,
[586.00 → 588.00] thank you.
[588.00 → 590.00] Thank you.
[590.00 → 592.00] Thank you.
[592.00 → 594.00] We love you.
[594.00 → 596.00] Thank you.
[596.00 → 597.00] Thank you.
[597.00 → 599.00] Thank you.
[627.00 → 629.00] Thank you.
[629.00 → 631.00] God,
[659.00 → 660.00] Thank you.
[660.00 → 664.00] Okay, thank you.
[664.00 → 665.00] Thank you.
[665.00 → 667.00] Thank you.
[667.00 → 669.00] Thank you.
[669.00 → 682.82] Thank you.
[682.82 → 689.82] Yes, I'm waving at you in the room in the back.
[689.82 → 696.82] Our people in the back need some waves. Good.
[696.82 → 720.82] As morning dawns and evening fades, you inspire songs of praise.
[720.82 → 731.82] Then rise from earth to touch your heart and glorify your name.
[731.82 → 742.82] Your name is a strong and mighty tower. Your name is a shelter like no other.
[742.82 → 752.82] Your name is a shelter like no other. Your name is a shelter like no other.
[752.82 → 756.82] But your name.
[764.82 → 775.82] Jesus, in your name we pray. Come and fill our hearts today.
[775.82 → 786.82] Lord, give us strength to live for you and glorify your name.
[786.82 → 797.82] Your name is a strong and mighty tower. Your name is a shelter like no other.
[797.82 → 807.82] Your name. Let the nation sing it louder. Because nothing has the power to save.
[807.82 → 814.82] But your name.
[814.82 → 819.82] Your name.
[819.82 → 824.82] Your name is a shelter like no other. Your name.
[824.82 → 830.82] Let the nation sing it louder. Because nothing has the power to save.
[830.82 → 839.30] Because nothing has the power to say but your name.
[849.10 → 850.54] You may be seated.
[852.22 → 855.30] Our order of worship is a little bit different today
[855.30 → 861.68] because one of the reasons we really praise and worship God
[861.68 → 865.96] is because of his saving work in our lives.
[866.30 → 869.50] And so while we've sung a few praise songs already,
[869.56 → 873.44] we're going to sing the rest of them after we've had our confession
[873.44 → 878.58] and we are assured of pardon, and we are assured of freedom
[878.58 → 881.80] and we worship God and praise him for that.
[881.80 → 891.02] So our confession involves a little bit of this weekend,
[891.14 → 893.54] which is a time to focus on our country's history
[893.54 → 895.36] with our indigenous neighbours
[895.36 → 898.30] and how we can follow in Jesus' footsteps,
[898.76 → 900.86] advocating for truth and reconciliation.
[901.92 → 904.62] As a church, we say that all are welcome here.
[905.36 → 907.98] If we say that, we must also confess
[907.98 → 911.48] that historically we have not been Christ-like
[911.48 → 913.30] in our treatment of other peoples
[913.30 → 916.08] and we can do better than in the past.
[916.86 → 919.52] Our prayer of confession comes from our
[919.52 → 920.94] Lift Your Hearts hymnal.
[921.66 → 927.26] It is a prayer of indigenous peoples,
[927.48 → 930.14] refugees, immigrants, and pilgrims.
[932.30 → 933.56] Towards the end of the prayer,
[933.66 → 934.98] there will be some words on the screen
[934.98 → 937.46] and I will invite you to join in.
[937.54 → 938.94] But since it's a bit longer,
[939.12 → 941.10] we're just going to have the part that you join in.
[942.44 → 943.38] Let's pray together.
[943.38 → 951.40] Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[952.10 → 955.54] we come before you as many parts of a single body,
[956.28 → 958.34] people drawn from every tribe,
[958.94 → 960.84] every nation, every language,
[961.60 → 964.08] some indigenous peoples of the land,
[964.86 → 968.02] some refugees, immigrants, pilgrims,
[968.74 → 970.00] people on the move,
[970.34 → 973.18] some hosts, some guests,
[973.38 → 976.26] some, both hosts and guests,
[976.76 → 979.34] all of us searching for an eternal place
[979.34 → 980.68] where we can belong.
[981.94 → 983.78] Creator, forgive us.
[984.28 → 986.36] The earth is yours and everything that is in it,
[986.84 → 987.80] but we forget.
[988.76 → 990.94] In our arrogance, we think we own it.
[991.60 → 993.86] In our greed, we think we can steal it.
[994.46 → 996.62] In our ignorance, we worship it.
[997.34 → 999.92] In our thoughtlessness, we destroy it.
[999.92 → 1005.02] We forget that you created it to bring praise and joy to you,
[1005.30 → 1008.26] that you gave it as a gift for us to steward,
[1008.48 → 1009.96] for us to enjoy.
[1009.96 → 1012.52] Jesus, save us.
[1012.52 → 1015.10] We wait for your kingdom.
[1015.92 → 1017.56] We long for your throne.
[1018.10 → 1019.70] We hunger for your reconciliation,
[1020.44 → 1023.48] for that day when people from every tribe and every tongue
[1023.48 → 1026.04] will gather around you and sing your praises.
[1026.04 → 1028.78] Holy Spirit, teach us.
[1029.42 → 1033.14] Help us to remember that the body is made up of many parts,
[1033.30 → 1035.66] each one unique and every one necessary.
[1036.60 → 1039.88] Teach us to embrace the discomfort that comes from our diversity
[1039.88 → 1043.10] and to celebrate the fact that we are unified,
[1043.56 → 1045.04] not through our sameness,
[1045.56 → 1048.22] but through the blood of our Lord and Saviour,
[1048.64 → 1049.48] Jesus Christ.
[1049.48 → 1051.66] And we say together,
[1053.22 → 1055.60] Triune God, we love you.
[1056.20 → 1058.06] Your creation is beautiful.
[1058.86 → 1060.70] Your salvation is merciful.
[1061.40 → 1064.10] And your wisdom is beyond compare.
[1064.88 → 1067.70] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[1068.32 → 1068.62] Amen.
[1070.62 → 1071.62] Thank you.
[1071.70 → 1076.78] Oh, we're just going to sing our song of confession,
[1076.78 → 1078.48] His mercy is more.
[1079.48 → 1098.76] What love could remember no wrongs we have done?
[1099.62 → 1104.14] Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their song.
[1104.14 → 1110.14] Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore.
[1110.78 → 1116.14] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1116.14 → 1131.14] What patience would wait as we constantly roam.
[1131.14 → 1137.04] What father, so tender is calling us home.
[1137.40 → 1142.64] He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor.
[1143.64 → 1149.44] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1149.78 → 1152.28] Praise the Lord.
[1152.28 → 1154.28] His mercy is more.
[1154.28 → 1156.28] His mercy is more.
[1156.28 → 1158.28] His mercy is more.
[1160.92 → 1165.66] Stronger the darkness, new every more.
[1165.66 → 1171.14] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1171.14 → 1172.14] Praise the Lord.
[1172.14 → 1179.86] What riches of kindness He lavished on us.
[1179.86 → 1185.12] His blood was the payment, His life was the cost.
[1185.12 → 1190.66] We stood near the death we could never afford.
[1190.66 → 1192.66] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1192.66 → 1196.66] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1196.66 → 1197.66] Praise the Lord.
[1197.66 → 1198.66] Praise the Lord.
[1198.66 → 1200.66] His mercy is more.
[1200.66 → 1201.66] His mercy is more.
[1201.66 → 1206.66] His mercy is more.
[1206.66 → 1211.66] Stronger the darkness, new every more.
[1211.66 → 1216.66] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1216.66 → 1217.66] His mercy is more.
[1217.66 → 1218.66] Praise the Lord.
[1218.66 → 1219.66] Praise the Lord.
[1219.66 → 1221.66] His mercy is more.
[1221.66 → 1223.66] His mercy is more.
[1223.66 → 1228.66] His mercy is more.
[1228.66 → 1234.66] Stronger the darkness, new every more.
[1234.66 → 1239.66] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1239.66 → 1246.66] Stronger the darkness, new every more.
[1246.66 → 1248.66] Thank you, Lord.
[1248.66 → 1255.66] Thankfully, in His graciousness, God doesn't stand waiting to punish us.
[1255.66 → 1268.66] On the contrary, the Bible also tells us that if we confess our sins, God will forgive our sins and cleanse us.
[1268.66 → 1273.66] And even more, He helps us overcome our sins and weaknesses.
[1273.66 → 1275.66] He never lets go of us.
[1275.66 → 1277.66] Listen.
[1277.66 → 1284.66] For Romans 8, 37-39.
[1284.66 → 1291.66] But despite all this, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ who loved us enough to die for us.
[1291.66 → 1296.66] For I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from His love.
[1296.66 → 1299.66] Death can't and life can't.
[1299.66 → 1305.66] The angels won't and all the powers of hell itself cannot keep God's love away.
[1305.66 → 1323.66] Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow or where we are, high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of God demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ when He died for us.
[1323.66 → 1325.66] We won't fear the battle.
[1325.66 → 1326.66] We won't fear the night.
[1326.66 → 1327.66] We won't fear the night.
[1327.66 → 1330.66] We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[1330.66 → 1331.66] You will go before us.
[1331.66 → 1332.66] You will lead the way.
[1332.66 → 1333.66] We have found a refuge.
[1333.66 → 1334.66] Only you can save.
[1334.66 → 1335.66] We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[1335.66 → 1337.66] We will go before us.
[1337.66 → 1339.66] You will lead the way.
[1339.66 → 1340.66] We have found a refuge.
[1340.66 → 1347.66] We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[1347.66 → 1349.66] We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[1349.66 → 1351.66] You will go before us.
[1351.66 → 1353.66] You will lead the way.
[1353.66 → 1355.66] We have found a refuge.
[1355.66 → 1356.66] Only you can save.
[1356.66 → 1357.66] Sing with joy now.
[1357.66 → 1358.66] Our God is for us.
[1358.66 → 1359.66] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[1359.66 → 1360.66] Raise your voice now.
[1360.66 → 1361.66] No love is greater.
[1361.66 → 1362.66] Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1362.66 → 1363.66] Would you rise, please, and sing this with us again?
[1363.66 → 1381.66] Even when I stumble, Even when I stumble, Even when I stumble,
[1381.66 → 1384.66] Can you guys please sing this with us again?
[1390.66 → 1395.66] Even when I stumble, even when I fall
[1395.66 → 1400.66] Even when I turn back, still your love is sure
[1400.66 → 1405.66] You will not abandon, you will not forsake
[1405.66 → 1411.66] You will cheer the yonder with never-ending days
[1411.66 → 1416.66] Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1416.66 → 1421.66] Our Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1421.66 → 1426.66] Raise your voice now, your love is greater
[1426.66 → 1432.66] Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1435.66 → 1445.66] Neither height nor depth can separate us
[1445.66 → 1450.66] Hell and death will not defeat us
[1450.66 → 1455.66] He who gave his Son to free us
[1455.66 → 1459.66] Hold He in His love
[1459.66 → 1461.66] Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1461.66 → 1463.66] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1463.66 → 1466.66] Ring with joy now, our God is for us
[1466.66 → 1471.66] Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1471.66 → 1476.66] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1476.66 → 1480.66] Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1480.66 → 1485.66] Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1485.66 → 1495.66] Raise your voice now, our God is for us
[1495.66 → 1497.66] Raise your voice now, no love is greater
[1497.66 → 1502.66] Who can stand against us if our God is for us
[1502.66 → 1507.66] Raise your joy now, our God is for us
[1507.66 → 1512.66] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1512.66 → 1517.66] Raise your voice now, our God is for us
[1517.66 → 1522.66] Who can stand against us if our God is for us
[1522.66 → 1535.66] INI Andes
[1535.66 → 1538.30] Find us on Chechen
[1538.30 → 1566.78] We are a moment, you are forever, Lord of the ages, God in your time.
[1566.78 → 1582.18] We are a vapour, you are eternal, love everlasting, reigning on life.
[1582.18 → 1595.86] Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1595.86 → 1608.60] Highest praises, honour and glory be unto your name.
[1608.60 → 1614.88] Be unto your name.
[1616.56 → 1622.88] We are the broken, you are the healer.
[1622.88 → 1629.52] Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save.
[1630.16 → 1636.06] You are the love song we'll sing forever.
[1636.96 → 1643.72] Vowing before you, blessing your name.
[1643.72 → 1658.16] Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1658.16 → 1670.86] Highest praises, honour and glory be unto your name.
[1670.86 → 1677.86] Be unto your name.
[1677.86 → 1678.86] Give unto your name.
[1678.86 → 1680.00] Amen.
[1680.00 → 1680.96] Amen.
[1680.96 → 1682.76] Allow us to praise.
[1682.76 → 1684.20] Amen.
[1684.20 → 1685.80] Hear something.
[1685.80 → 1687.04] Right.
[1687.04 → 1702.42] I lie, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you.
[1702.42 → 1707.42] Oh, my soul, rejoice.
[1708.42 → 1716.42] Take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[1717.04 → 1727.60] May it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1727.60 → 1742.68] I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you.
[1742.68 → 1747.68] Oh, my soul, rejoice.
[1749.00 → 1752.82] Take joy, my King.
[1752.82 → 1767.38] In what you hear, may it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1767.38 → 1777.94] Sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1777.94 → 1784.22] You may be seated, and the children can go to a kid's life.
[1784.22 → 1790.22] Sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1790.22 → 1812.52] That was very lovely singing.
[1814.14 → 1815.16] Good morning.
[1815.16 → 1821.54] If you've got a Bible, please turn in Acts chapter 16.
[1822.14 → 1825.60] In your church Bible, it is on page 825.
[1827.14 → 1828.86] 825 in your pew Bible.
[1829.22 → 1832.00] So we have been working our way through the book of Acts.
[1832.68 → 1839.80] Last week, we saw how God guided Paul and his travelling companions,
[1840.48 → 1843.56] who are Silas and Timothy and Luke.
[1843.56 → 1847.48] And God guided them to the city of tRNAs.
[1848.36 → 1852.86] And then while in tRNAs, Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia.
[1853.80 → 1857.18] The man in the vision was saying, come and help us.
[1857.28 → 1858.92] Come and preach the gospel.
[1858.92 → 1864.62] Now, it's easy to see how this passage fits into Luke's story.
[1865.00 → 1872.96] Because we see the call of Jesus early on in Acts to these leaders, these apostles,
[1873.90 → 1877.80] saying, go spread the good news.
[1877.80 → 1880.72] And then do this from Jerusalem.
[1881.72 → 1884.64] And then into Judea and Samaria.
[1885.22 → 1887.60] And then to the ends of the earth.
[1888.58 → 1891.82] Now, Macedonia, while it's not quite the ends of the earth,
[1892.40 → 1894.90] it certainly was a huge step in that direction.
[1895.40 → 1895.68] Right?
[1895.74 → 1898.78] Moving even further and further away from Jerusalem.
[1898.78 → 1905.52] In fact, this is the first time that the gospel goes into Europe.
[1906.38 → 1907.44] So this is significant.
[1908.80 → 1910.56] And so let's read our passage this morning.
[1911.64 → 1915.08] Acts 16, beginning at verse 11.
[1915.92 → 1917.34] And we'll read to verse 15.
[1917.34 → 1925.18] From tRNAs, we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace.
[1925.88 → 1928.48] And the next day, we went on to Annapolis.
[1928.80 → 1932.06] And from there, we travelled to Philippi, a Roman colony,
[1932.48 → 1935.00] in the leading city of that district of Macedonia.
[1935.78 → 1937.54] And we stayed there several days.
[1938.66 → 1943.48] On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate to the river,
[1944.02 → 1946.92] where we expected to find a place of prayer.
[1947.34 → 1952.78] We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
[1953.96 → 1959.48] One of those listening was a woman from the city of Theatre,
[1959.94 → 1962.92] named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth.
[1963.64 → 1965.32] She was a worshipper of God.
[1966.24 → 1971.32] The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.
[1972.38 → 1975.34] When she and the members of her household were baptized,
[1975.34 → 1977.72] she invited us to her home.
[1978.28 → 1981.42] If you consider me a believer in the Lord, she said,
[1981.84 → 1984.82] come and stay at my house.
[1985.66 → 1987.32] And she persuaded us.
[1988.20 → 1989.66] This is the word of the Lord.
[1991.12 → 1995.56] Now let's pray and let's ask God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[1995.66 → 1996.32] Let's pray together.
[1996.32 → 2002.52] Our Father, we thank you that you use your word,
[2002.88 → 2006.32] you use the preaching of the gospel to open hearts,
[2006.94 → 2011.96] to bring new life, to bring new hope into the world.
[2012.48 → 2016.88] So Lord, we ask that you would do that same work in our hearts this morning,
[2016.88 → 2021.34] and that you would have the glory,
[2021.98 → 2023.20] all the glory,
[2023.72 → 2025.86] in all that we say, in all that we do.
[2026.38 → 2028.18] For Jesus' sake, amen.
[2030.38 → 2033.54] Now perhaps for most of us sitting here,
[2033.82 → 2037.66] we have some sort of conversion story.
[2038.18 → 2041.18] If you are a Christian, you have a conversion story.
[2041.18 → 2043.30] I love hearing these stories.
[2043.42 → 2048.14] I love hearing how people have come to love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2049.64 → 2052.94] You know whether it's talking to someone in conversation,
[2053.16 → 2054.80] getting to know them, hearing, just saying,
[2054.92 → 2056.38] like, how did you come to know the Lord?
[2056.76 → 2063.16] Or whether it's reading it in a biography of a well-known Christian brother or sister.
[2064.46 → 2069.62] And one conversion story that is quite well-known is that of Charles Spurgeon.
[2069.62 → 2071.92] Remember, we mentioned Charles Spurgeon a couple of weeks ago,
[2071.98 → 2073.16] the guy who smoked the cigars.
[2073.90 → 2077.48] Well, this guy has quite a conversion story.
[2078.60 → 2084.70] In 1850, the young Charles Spurgeon was a 15-year-old boy.
[2085.96 → 2087.88] And one Sunday morning in January,
[2088.62 → 2092.08] he was trudging up a hill on his way to church
[2092.08 → 2096.54] when a blizzard blew in and prevented him from going any further.
[2096.54 → 2101.82] So he turned the corner and made his way into a small Methodist church.
[2102.92 → 2105.64] As Spurgeon tells the story, he says this,
[2106.36 → 2111.42] in that chapel, there might be a dozen or 15 people.
[2112.24 → 2113.96] The minister did not come that morning.
[2114.46 → 2115.60] Snowed up, I suppose.
[2115.60 → 2122.32] So a poor man, a shoemaker, a tailor, or something of that sort,
[2122.42 → 2124.16] went up into the pulpit to preach.
[2125.08 → 2127.80] He was obliged to stick to his text
[2127.80 → 2130.92] for the simple reason that he had nothing else to say.
[2132.90 → 2134.82] Now, well, he had enough to say
[2134.82 → 2136.90] that one of the greatest preachers ever
[2136.90 → 2139.22] came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2139.22 → 2142.32] through this simple man's simple words.
[2143.18 → 2149.16] And his text was from Isaiah 45, verse 22.
[2149.42 → 2150.32] I'll put it up there.
[2153.64 → 2156.90] Look unto me, and be ye saved,
[2157.12 → 2158.88] all the ends of the earth.
[2158.88 → 2163.48] So the preacher began making some comments on the text.
[2163.60 → 2164.04] He said,
[2164.42 → 2165.22] Dear friends,
[2165.82 → 2167.84] this is a very simple text indeed.
[2168.66 → 2169.40] It says,
[2170.04 → 2170.36] Look.
[2171.22 → 2173.44] Now that does not take a great deal of effort.
[2174.00 → 2174.88] Anyone can look.
[2175.04 → 2175.96] A child can look.
[2176.60 → 2177.98] But this is what the text says.
[2179.14 → 2180.08] Then it says,
[2180.22 → 2181.18] Look unto me.
[2182.42 → 2185.26] Many of you are looking to yourselves.
[2185.26 → 2187.96] No use looking there.
[2188.82 → 2192.00] You'll never find comfort in yourselves.
[2193.30 → 2195.04] I think it's doing pretty well so far.
[2196.36 → 2199.24] But the moment came when the preacher looked up
[2199.24 → 2201.58] and saw that Spurgeon was a visitor.
[2202.52 → 2204.04] There's only ten, you know, a dozen people.
[2205.42 → 2207.42] And he looks at this young man,
[2207.72 → 2208.76] and do you know what he says?
[2209.66 → 2210.24] He says,
[2210.40 → 2213.18] Young man, you look very miserable.
[2213.18 → 2217.68] Well, I did, said Spurgeon.
[2218.12 → 2220.80] But I had not been accustomed to having remarks made
[2220.80 → 2222.90] on my personal appearance from the pulpit before.
[2224.06 → 2225.46] I won't do that, don't worry.
[2227.00 → 2228.44] The preacher continued,
[2229.36 → 2231.14] And you will always be miserable,
[2231.52 → 2233.50] miserable in life and miserable in death,
[2233.86 → 2236.12] if you do not obey my text.
[2236.12 → 2239.44] But if you obey now,
[2239.62 → 2240.46] this moment,
[2241.12 → 2242.62] you will be saved.
[2243.54 → 2245.44] Then lifting his hands
[2245.44 → 2247.70] and shouting as only a Methodist could do,
[2247.90 → 2248.52] Spurgeon says,
[2249.20 → 2249.98] The preacher says,
[2250.10 → 2252.76] Young man, look to Jesus Christ.
[2253.20 → 2255.02] Look, look, look.
[2255.66 → 2257.18] You have nothing to do,
[2257.50 → 2258.74] but look
[2258.74 → 2261.12] and be saved.
[2261.12 → 2264.36] And he was converted.
[2265.96 → 2266.96] Spurgeon says,
[2267.78 → 2268.78] There and then,
[2269.40 → 2270.76] the cloud was gone.
[2271.28 → 2272.84] The darkness had rolled away,
[2273.38 → 2274.98] and I could have risen that moment
[2274.98 → 2278.00] and sung with the most enthusiastic of them,
[2278.26 → 2280.70] of the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[2282.66 → 2283.48] You know, and friends,
[2283.52 → 2284.76] that's the power of the gospel.
[2284.76 → 2287.64] To open a heart.
[2288.46 → 2288.60] You know,
[2288.68 → 2291.02] whether that was Charles Spurgeon's,
[2291.58 → 2292.58] or whether
[2292.58 → 2295.48] with this wonderful woman
[2295.48 → 2296.74] named Lydia,
[2297.24 → 2298.18] who we read about
[2298.18 → 2299.40] in our passage this morning.
[2300.52 → 2302.30] Now, Lydia's conversion story,
[2302.40 → 2303.10] we might say,
[2303.44 → 2304.74] is rather boring.
[2305.64 → 2306.94] It's not very remarkable.
[2308.04 → 2308.28] You know,
[2308.32 → 2309.50] and if she were to get up
[2309.50 → 2310.24] and from the church
[2310.24 → 2311.86] on maybe a testimony Sunday,
[2312.42 → 2314.04] we might only need to give her
[2314.04 → 2315.42] one or two minutes
[2315.42 → 2318.28] to tell how she came to know Jesus.
[2318.98 → 2320.14] And then we might hope
[2320.14 → 2321.70] that the testimony of the next person
[2321.70 → 2323.16] is a bit more exciting,
[2323.84 → 2325.36] maybe a bit more extravagant.
[2326.64 → 2328.98] But there is something beautiful
[2328.98 → 2331.24] in her story,
[2331.78 → 2334.22] just in the plainness of the language,
[2334.52 → 2336.66] in the simplicity of what goes on here,
[2337.26 → 2338.86] and in the way God met her,
[2339.80 → 2341.52] and then in what she did as a result.
[2341.52 → 2344.64] And it is not a story
[2344.64 → 2347.34] that we should quickly breeze over.
[2348.14 → 2349.06] So this morning,
[2349.12 → 2349.72] what I want to do
[2349.72 → 2350.90] is let's just take a look
[2350.90 → 2352.76] at Lydia's conversion story,
[2353.34 → 2355.04] how God opened her heart,
[2355.52 → 2356.68] and then we'll see
[2356.68 → 2358.20] how she responds.
[2358.58 → 2359.66] And she responds
[2359.66 → 2361.38] by opening her home
[2361.38 → 2363.30] to Paul and his companions.
[2363.30 → 2366.34] So Paul and his companions
[2366.34 → 2367.70] took a ship.
[2367.78 → 2368.08] Remember,
[2368.22 → 2368.86] they took a ship
[2368.86 → 2370.52] from tRNAs in Asia Minor
[2370.52 → 2372.62] to Macedonia,
[2372.94 → 2374.28] and they arrive in the city
[2374.28 → 2375.12] of Philippi,
[2375.20 → 2376.58] which is in modern-day Greece.
[2377.42 → 2378.98] Now we know from earlier
[2378.98 → 2380.04] in the book of Acts,
[2380.62 → 2382.56] Paul's normal practice
[2382.56 → 2383.98] when he goes to a new city
[2383.98 → 2384.70] is to do what?
[2385.54 → 2387.10] He would go to a synagogue,
[2387.60 → 2388.62] and he would go speak
[2388.62 → 2389.16] in the synagogue.
[2389.16 → 2391.72] But in Philippi,
[2392.32 → 2393.00] evidently,
[2393.42 → 2394.64] there wasn't one.
[2395.68 → 2397.22] Now this is rather surprising,
[2397.64 → 2399.64] because according to Jewish custom,
[2400.26 → 2402.40] you only need ten men
[2402.40 → 2403.62] to form a synagogue.
[2404.58 → 2405.32] So in this city,
[2405.42 → 2407.36] there are not even ten Jewish males.
[2408.84 → 2411.04] So because there is no synagogue
[2411.04 → 2412.32] for them to go to,
[2412.40 → 2412.86] they say,
[2413.30 → 2413.54] well,
[2413.90 → 2416.20] maybe there is a place of prayer,
[2416.20 → 2418.00] which would have been
[2418.00 → 2419.66] an informal gathering place.
[2420.02 → 2421.28] Many synagogues,
[2421.86 → 2423.24] then places of prayer,
[2423.42 → 2424.34] were actually built
[2424.34 → 2425.52] near water sources,
[2425.68 → 2426.24] like a river,
[2426.56 → 2428.60] in order to make it more convenient
[2428.60 → 2430.32] to facilitate ritual washing.
[2431.02 → 2431.88] So Paul says,
[2432.28 → 2433.60] let's go down to the river.
[2434.28 → 2437.34] Maybe there are some God-fearing.
[2437.40 → 2439.34] Maybe there are some worshippers of Yahweh,
[2439.70 → 2441.12] and let's see if we can find them.
[2442.20 → 2442.84] So now,
[2443.00 → 2443.90] just a little aside,
[2443.90 → 2445.62] do you know what song has been
[2445.62 → 2446.78] in my mind all week?
[2449.10 → 2449.72] What is it?
[2451.08 → 2451.48] Exactly.
[2453.38 → 2454.72] We should have coordinated this.
[2455.38 → 2457.08] As I went down to the river to pray.
[2457.26 → 2458.30] Do you know that Alison Kraus's?
[2458.68 → 2459.38] Look it up on YouTube
[2459.38 → 2460.14] when you get home
[2460.14 → 2461.46] and kind of read this,
[2461.56 → 2461.94] sing along.
[2462.76 → 2464.28] As I went down to the river to pray.
[2464.54 → 2465.48] So, anyway,
[2465.64 → 2466.16] on the Sabbath,
[2466.76 → 2467.82] they go down to the river
[2467.82 → 2468.82] to pray,
[2469.10 → 2470.80] and they find some women
[2470.80 → 2472.32] who had gathered there.
[2472.32 → 2473.44] Again,
[2473.92 → 2474.84] there's no synagogue,
[2475.60 → 2476.34] so these women,
[2476.42 → 2477.36] they were just doing
[2477.36 → 2479.44] what they could do.
[2479.50 → 2480.38] They were being faithful
[2480.38 → 2481.58] in what they could do,
[2481.84 → 2483.62] which was to meet on the Sabbath
[2483.62 → 2485.40] and to pray together.
[2486.74 → 2488.26] So Paul and his companions,
[2488.50 → 2490.10] they go, and they join them,
[2490.56 → 2491.66] and I'm sure these women
[2491.66 → 2492.68] would have been delighted
[2492.68 → 2495.64] to run into a real-life Pharisee,
[2496.44 → 2496.62] right?
[2496.62 → 2498.74] A knowledgeable teacher of the law
[2498.74 → 2501.40] in this far-off Roman colony
[2501.40 → 2503.06] so far from Jerusalem.
[2504.02 → 2504.64] And Paul,
[2504.94 → 2507.38] he begins to tell them about Jesus.
[2508.00 → 2509.36] He begins to share the gospel.
[2509.68 → 2510.98] And then we are immediately
[2510.98 → 2512.80] introduced to Lydia.
[2513.78 → 2515.26] And we're told who she is
[2515.26 → 2516.10] in verse 14.
[2517.58 → 2519.60] So this is what verse 14 says.
[2519.60 → 2521.60] One of those listening
[2521.60 → 2523.90] was a woman from the city
[2523.90 → 2525.08] of Theatre
[2525.08 → 2526.76] named Lydia,
[2527.32 → 2528.98] a dealer in purple cloth.
[2529.68 → 2531.38] She was a worshipper of God.
[2532.36 → 2534.50] Now these little details by Luke
[2534.50 → 2536.40] are very important to us
[2536.40 → 2537.98] to get a background
[2537.98 → 2539.42] on the type of person
[2539.42 → 2540.52] that Lydia is.
[2541.16 → 2542.12] So it says
[2542.12 → 2545.00] she is a dealer in purple cloth.
[2545.72 → 2546.78] Now that doesn't mean
[2546.78 → 2548.34] she has some weird fixation
[2548.34 → 2549.30] on the colour purple.
[2549.90 → 2550.44] Just like,
[2550.54 → 2551.36] I just love purple.
[2551.50 → 2552.64] Only purple cloth for me.
[2553.30 → 2554.72] No, purple was
[2554.72 → 2556.12] the most expensive
[2556.12 → 2557.68] kind of dye.
[2558.72 → 2559.90] And so purple cloth
[2559.90 → 2562.32] was really high-end stuff.
[2562.88 → 2564.02] It was the colour
[2564.02 → 2565.74] in the Roman Empire
[2565.74 → 2566.96] worn by senators
[2566.96 → 2568.22] and generals,
[2568.40 → 2569.10] military generals.
[2569.72 → 2570.84] So in other words,
[2571.54 → 2572.56] Lydia is running
[2572.56 → 2575.04] a pretty significant business
[2575.04 → 2576.76] dealing in high-end
[2576.78 → 2578.28] materials and fashion.
[2579.40 → 2580.44] And we're told,
[2580.88 → 2581.28] also,
[2582.22 → 2584.06] she is a worshipper of God.
[2584.92 → 2586.16] That means she likely
[2586.16 → 2587.22] wasn't a Jewish woman,
[2588.00 → 2591.00] but rather a Gentile God-fearing,
[2591.08 → 2592.58] much like Cornelius,
[2592.62 → 2593.76] who we met in chapter 10.
[2594.86 → 2595.76] At some point,
[2596.06 → 2597.08] she had come across
[2597.08 → 2598.48] teachings from the Old Testament,
[2598.94 → 2600.76] and she had come to believe
[2600.76 → 2601.58] in the God of Abraham.
[2603.22 → 2604.90] So that's a bit of the background
[2604.90 → 2606.22] that Luke tells us
[2606.22 → 2607.56] about who Lydia is.
[2607.86 → 2609.42] She is a businesswoman,
[2609.86 → 2610.74] very successful,
[2611.06 → 2612.38] dealer in purple cloth,
[2612.72 → 2613.56] and she's a worshipper
[2613.56 → 2614.32] of Yahweh.
[2615.38 → 2616.76] But then Paul begins
[2616.76 → 2617.78] to speak to her
[2617.78 → 2619.30] about Jesus Christ.
[2619.96 → 2620.76] And we're told
[2620.76 → 2622.86] how she responds.
[2623.60 → 2624.64] So look at the end
[2624.64 → 2625.74] of verse 14.
[2626.36 → 2626.72] It says,
[2626.72 → 2629.38] the Lord opened her heart
[2629.38 → 2630.40] to respond
[2630.40 → 2631.62] to Paul's message.
[2634.18 → 2634.92] That's it.
[2635.46 → 2636.94] That's her conversion story.
[2637.68 → 2640.30] The Lord opened her heart.
[2641.18 → 2642.12] It's simple.
[2642.80 → 2643.94] It is beautiful.
[2645.62 → 2647.42] There's also an important detail
[2647.42 → 2648.42] of what it means
[2648.42 → 2649.70] when someone's heart is opened.
[2649.70 → 2652.80] The Lord opened her heart
[2652.80 → 2654.32] to do what?
[2655.54 → 2657.02] To respond
[2657.02 → 2658.48] to Paul's message.
[2660.36 → 2662.22] As her heart was opened,
[2663.08 → 2664.06] it was opened
[2664.06 → 2664.94] to the message
[2664.94 → 2666.06] that Paul was preaching.
[2666.48 → 2668.08] That the Son of God
[2668.08 → 2669.80] became flesh,
[2670.40 → 2671.42] and he died
[2671.42 → 2672.26] for sinners.
[2673.20 → 2673.32] Right?
[2673.36 → 2674.04] And that was always
[2674.04 → 2675.50] the core of Paul's message.
[2676.58 → 2678.56] That he was raised again.
[2679.70 → 2681.14] And it was listening
[2681.14 → 2682.06] to that message
[2682.06 → 2684.24] that God sent his Son
[2684.24 → 2685.16] to die for sinners
[2685.16 → 2686.32] and rise him from the dead
[2686.32 → 2688.20] that her heart
[2688.20 → 2689.22] was opened.
[2690.94 → 2693.14] But why did Lydia listen?
[2694.36 → 2695.46] Why did she
[2695.46 → 2697.06] give her attention
[2697.06 → 2697.96] to Paul?
[2698.36 → 2699.44] Because it would seem
[2699.44 → 2700.68] that there were other women
[2700.68 → 2702.72] who decided
[2702.72 → 2703.92] not to respond
[2703.92 → 2704.64] to the gospel.
[2705.98 → 2706.94] Lydia responded.
[2707.50 → 2708.24] These other women
[2708.24 → 2709.00] who were praying
[2709.00 → 2709.68] to God
[2709.68 → 2710.36] Yahweh
[2710.36 → 2711.84] as they knew best.
[2712.22 → 2713.30] They didn't respond
[2713.30 → 2713.96] to the gospel.
[2714.40 → 2715.74] Why did she believe?
[2717.10 → 2718.06] Because God
[2718.06 → 2718.96] opened her heart.
[2720.04 → 2720.18] Right?
[2720.24 → 2721.10] Out of his grace,
[2721.18 → 2722.10] out of his mercy,
[2722.28 → 2723.50] he opened her heart.
[2723.56 → 2724.06] That's why.
[2725.70 → 2726.26] And again,
[2726.32 → 2726.72] you might think
[2726.72 → 2727.64] that's kind of a boring
[2727.64 → 2728.64] conversion story.
[2729.40 → 2729.60] Right?
[2729.62 → 2730.48] There was nothing dramatic
[2730.48 → 2730.90] to it.
[2730.94 → 2732.08] There were no signs
[2732.08 → 2732.58] or wonders.
[2732.78 → 2733.54] There was no healing.
[2733.92 → 2734.64] There was no,
[2734.64 → 2735.02] you know,
[2735.12 → 2735.94] exorcism.
[2736.84 → 2738.10] God just opened
[2738.10 → 2738.54] her heart
[2738.54 → 2739.28] and she responded.
[2741.48 → 2742.34] Kind of boring.
[2743.30 → 2744.20] But then you think
[2744.20 → 2745.52] about who opened
[2745.52 → 2746.16] her heart.
[2747.50 → 2748.02] God
[2748.02 → 2749.52] opened her heart.
[2750.38 → 2750.52] Right?
[2750.62 → 2751.66] And could there be
[2751.66 → 2752.78] anything more dramatic
[2752.78 → 2753.30] than that?
[2753.86 → 2754.46] God
[2754.46 → 2755.74] opening a heart.
[2755.82 → 2756.78] The God of heaven
[2756.78 → 2757.32] and earth.
[2757.32 → 2758.88] the God who dwells
[2758.88 → 2759.62] in eternity.
[2762.12 → 2763.66] Fixing his eyes.
[2764.34 → 2765.50] Fixing his attention
[2765.50 → 2767.10] upon a woman
[2767.10 → 2769.82] in Philippi
[2769.82 → 2772.42] sitting on the bank
[2772.42 → 2773.10] of a river
[2773.10 → 2774.82] and then giving her
[2774.82 → 2775.98] the greatest gift
[2775.98 → 2776.76] that he could ever
[2776.76 → 2777.32] give her.
[2778.20 → 2779.04] A heart
[2779.04 → 2781.22] to receive Jesus Christ.
[2782.84 → 2783.06] Right?
[2783.20 → 2784.20] And so in a sense,
[2784.20 → 2784.50] friends,
[2784.94 → 2786.12] every conversion
[2786.12 → 2787.44] is dramatic.
[2788.54 → 2789.32] Every conversion
[2789.32 → 2789.88] is dramatic.
[2790.44 → 2791.46] For God to open
[2791.46 → 2791.98] the heart
[2791.98 → 2792.66] of a sinner
[2792.66 → 2794.74] is an amazing,
[2795.06 → 2795.50] exciting,
[2795.76 → 2796.42] dramatic thing.
[2796.50 → 2796.88] No matter
[2796.88 → 2798.12] what it looks like
[2798.12 → 2798.86] in each one
[2798.86 → 2799.56] of our stories
[2799.56 → 2800.48] is different
[2800.48 → 2801.12] the way God
[2801.12 → 2801.84] has met us.
[2804.56 → 2805.70] But it turns out
[2805.70 → 2806.58] it's not enough
[2806.58 → 2807.40] for her just
[2807.40 → 2808.14] to simply
[2808.14 → 2809.12] hear
[2809.12 → 2810.14] the preaching
[2810.14 → 2810.70] of the gospel.
[2811.48 → 2812.04] Her heart
[2812.04 → 2812.76] has to be open
[2812.76 → 2813.26] to it.
[2814.24 → 2814.36] Right?
[2814.52 → 2815.84] All human hearts
[2815.84 → 2816.88] need God
[2816.88 → 2817.96] to do something
[2817.96 → 2818.56] in them
[2818.56 → 2819.54] before we can
[2819.54 → 2820.34] receive the message
[2820.34 → 2820.88] of the gospel.
[2821.48 → 2821.76] Right?
[2821.82 → 2822.38] The human heart
[2822.38 → 2823.08] is not naturally
[2823.08 → 2823.82] set up
[2823.82 → 2825.20] to receive
[2825.20 → 2825.58] the message
[2825.58 → 2826.08] of Jesus
[2826.08 → 2826.82] and respond.
[2827.00 → 2828.00] God has to first
[2828.00 → 2829.18] do something.
[2830.38 → 2831.64] When I was a kid,
[2832.02 → 2833.94] my pastor
[2833.94 → 2835.20] would use
[2835.20 → 2835.86] this illustration.
[2836.06 → 2836.56] It's one that's
[2836.56 → 2837.50] always stuck with me.
[2838.06 → 2838.82] So I'll share it
[2838.82 → 2839.18] with you.
[2839.86 → 2840.36] He said,
[2840.44 → 2840.82] imagine,
[2841.28 → 2841.52] you know,
[2841.58 → 2842.38] in the church here,
[2842.38 → 2843.24] every person
[2843.24 → 2844.22] or in the pews,
[2844.36 → 2845.32] there is a pail.
[2846.80 → 2847.82] And in preaching
[2847.82 → 2848.44] the gospel,
[2848.60 → 2849.40] sharing about Jesus
[2849.40 → 2850.68] is taking a match
[2850.68 → 2851.86] and lighting that match
[2851.86 → 2853.14] and just throwing it
[2853.14 → 2853.72] into the pail.
[2854.60 → 2855.08] Now,
[2855.20 → 2856.74] if the pail is empty,
[2856.96 → 2857.50] what's going to happen
[2857.50 → 2858.28] to that match?
[2859.46 → 2860.88] It'll just go out.
[2862.28 → 2863.86] But if there are
[2863.86 → 2864.62] some pails
[2864.62 → 2865.72] that first
[2865.72 → 2866.26] have
[2866.26 → 2867.58] some lighter fluid
[2867.58 → 2868.08] in them
[2868.08 → 2869.82] or some gasoline,
[2870.34 → 2871.04] when you light
[2871.04 → 2871.74] that match
[2871.74 → 2872.62] and you throw it in,
[2872.66 → 2873.26] what's going to happen?
[2874.70 → 2875.22] There's going to be
[2875.22 → 2875.72] a reaction.
[2875.92 → 2877.02] There's going to be
[2877.02 → 2877.44] a flame.
[2878.70 → 2879.90] And in the same way,
[2880.58 → 2881.42] what we're seeing here
[2881.42 → 2881.98] in Acts
[2881.98 → 2882.82] is that the gospel,
[2883.10 → 2883.46] it can't,
[2883.88 → 2884.76] the preaching of the gospel,
[2884.90 → 2885.46] it can't land
[2885.46 → 2886.20] in our hearts
[2886.20 → 2887.46] and it can't catch fire
[2887.46 → 2888.20] and ignite
[2888.20 → 2890.38] until God first
[2890.38 → 2891.34] does something
[2891.34 → 2892.28] in our hearts.
[2893.00 → 2894.20] And he opens
[2894.20 → 2894.82] our hearts
[2894.82 → 2895.80] so then when we hear
[2895.80 → 2896.26] the gospel,
[2896.48 → 2897.48] we receive it.
[2897.48 → 2898.58] And it takes root
[2898.58 → 2900.52] and it ignites
[2900.52 → 2901.22] in our hearts.
[2903.26 → 2903.94] So yes,
[2903.96 → 2904.64] we need to hear
[2904.64 → 2905.94] the gospel message,
[2906.68 → 2908.18] but we also need
[2908.18 → 2908.98] God to open
[2908.98 → 2909.54] our hearts
[2909.54 → 2910.18] to respond
[2910.18 → 2910.94] to that message.
[2912.58 → 2912.86] You know,
[2912.92 → 2913.70] and what that means
[2913.70 → 2915.74] is that when we seek
[2915.74 → 2916.62] to share the gospel
[2916.62 → 2917.46] with other people,
[2917.68 → 2918.92] we need to pray,
[2919.14 → 2919.30] right?
[2919.32 → 2919.98] We need to pray.
[2920.42 → 2921.30] We need to be praying
[2921.30 → 2922.44] for God to do that,
[2922.48 → 2923.68] to open people's hearts.
[2924.86 → 2925.88] Because we can't
[2925.88 → 2926.90] open people's hearts.
[2927.48 → 2928.68] Only God can do that.
[2929.94 → 2930.34] But,
[2931.06 → 2931.36] you know,
[2931.42 → 2932.48] sometimes we pray,
[2933.00 → 2934.12] we're praying for God
[2934.12 → 2935.32] to open someone's hearts
[2935.32 → 2937.08] for a family member,
[2937.22 → 2937.98] for a friend,
[2938.68 → 2940.02] but we're not sharing
[2940.02 → 2940.52] the gospel,
[2941.52 → 2941.78] right?
[2941.88 → 2943.74] We're praying for God
[2943.74 → 2944.92] to work in someone's heart
[2944.92 → 2945.66] and God's like,
[2945.76 → 2945.94] well,
[2946.02 → 2947.50] I put you in their life
[2947.50 → 2948.92] for you to tell them
[2948.92 → 2949.44] about me.
[2951.00 → 2951.28] Okay,
[2951.28 → 2952.92] so we need to do
[2952.92 → 2953.66] what we can do
[2953.66 → 2954.52] and we need to trust God
[2954.52 → 2955.66] to do what only he does,
[2956.30 → 2956.50] right?
[2956.50 → 2957.40] We need to be faithful
[2957.40 → 2958.48] to do what we can do.
[2958.54 → 2959.56] Just like Lydia,
[2960.36 → 2961.50] she can't go to a synagogue,
[2961.76 → 2962.60] but she's being faithful
[2962.60 → 2963.40] in what she can do.
[2963.48 → 2964.64] She's gathering to pray
[2964.64 → 2965.90] on the Sabbath.
[2966.72 → 2967.98] And we need to be faithful
[2967.98 → 2968.82] in what we can do.
[2968.90 → 2970.08] We can tell people
[2970.08 → 2970.62] about Jesus.
[2970.92 → 2972.16] We can't open their hearts,
[2972.96 → 2976.00] but then God will meet us
[2976.00 → 2977.98] as we're faithful
[2977.98 → 2979.04] to share about Jesus.
[2979.70 → 2980.70] And then we pray
[2980.70 → 2981.44] and we pray
[2981.44 → 2982.68] and we trust God
[2982.68 → 2984.16] to do only what he can do,
[2984.58 → 2986.02] which is to open hearts.
[2987.20 → 2988.48] So that's Lydia.
[2988.62 → 2989.54] That's her conversion.
[2991.26 → 2992.64] And then what do we find
[2992.64 → 2993.84] is her response.
[2994.24 → 2995.18] What's the response
[2995.18 → 2995.92] to her conversion?
[2996.32 → 2998.06] And we read about that next,
[2998.12 → 2999.56] looking at verse 15.
[3001.00 → 3002.78] When she and the members
[3002.78 → 3003.68] of her household
[3003.68 → 3004.30] were baptized.
[3005.30 → 3005.58] Okay,
[3005.72 → 3006.70] so first,
[3006.86 → 3007.60] she gets baptized
[3007.60 → 3009.38] and that's a wonderful response.
[3010.00 → 3011.12] And we see in Acts,
[3011.16 → 3012.18] that is always the pattern.
[3012.78 → 3013.58] Someone believes
[3013.58 → 3014.98] and then they are baptized.
[3016.06 → 3016.82] And then it says
[3016.82 → 3018.30] her household was baptized.
[3019.12 → 3020.14] Now that's important
[3020.14 → 3021.96] and we're going to consider
[3021.96 → 3023.02] that in a few weeks
[3023.02 → 3023.86] when we look at
[3023.86 → 3024.80] the conversion
[3024.80 → 3026.68] of the Philippian jailer
[3026.68 → 3028.38] because his household
[3028.38 → 3030.30] is also baptized.
[3030.76 → 3030.92] Okay,
[3030.94 → 3031.94] so we'll come back to that.
[3032.38 → 3033.60] But now let's look
[3033.60 → 3035.12] at the first thing
[3035.12 → 3037.34] that this newly baptized,
[3037.34 → 3039.04] new convert does
[3039.04 → 3040.22] in verse 15.
[3041.16 → 3042.08] It says this,
[3042.72 → 3043.48] she invited us
[3043.48 → 3044.14] to her home.
[3045.10 → 3045.96] If you consider me
[3045.96 → 3047.00] a believer in the Lord,
[3047.10 → 3047.54] she said,
[3047.64 → 3048.44] come and stay
[3048.44 → 3049.66] at my house.
[3050.10 → 3052.08] And she persuaded us.
[3052.12 → 3052.58] And we'll leave
[3052.58 → 3053.48] that passage up there
[3053.48 → 3053.90] for a bit.
[3055.50 → 3056.58] As soon
[3056.58 → 3058.22] as she was converted,
[3058.34 → 3059.08] what does she want to do?
[3060.08 → 3061.22] She wants to show
[3061.22 → 3061.98] hospitality.
[3062.88 → 3064.06] The sign,
[3064.74 → 3065.52] the evidence
[3065.52 → 3066.12] that God
[3066.12 → 3066.64] has opened
[3066.64 → 3067.38] her heart
[3067.38 → 3068.18] to him
[3068.18 → 3069.12] is that she wants
[3069.12 → 3070.38] to open her home
[3070.38 → 3071.70] to Paul
[3071.70 → 3072.64] and his companions.
[3073.96 → 3074.64] And notice
[3074.64 → 3075.48] what's going on.
[3075.66 → 3076.50] She's not saying,
[3077.28 → 3077.42] you know,
[3077.50 → 3077.90] hey, look,
[3077.94 → 3078.76] I just live right down
[3078.76 → 3079.08] the road.
[3079.16 → 3079.52] Why don't you guys
[3079.52 → 3080.64] come over for a snack?
[3081.68 → 3082.20] Why don't you guys
[3082.20 → 3082.84] just pop in
[3082.84 → 3083.86] for a coffee?
[3084.72 → 3084.94] No,
[3085.00 → 3085.52] she says,
[3085.60 → 3087.32] come and stay
[3087.32 → 3088.84] at my house.
[3090.12 → 3090.78] And then look
[3090.78 → 3091.38] at the reason
[3091.38 → 3092.00] she gives.
[3092.76 → 3092.96] Right?
[3093.02 → 3093.64] She doesn't say,
[3093.64 → 3094.04] listen,
[3094.20 → 3094.50] you guys,
[3094.58 → 3095.40] you've got to come around.
[3095.50 → 3096.88] I just did a Reno
[3096.88 → 3097.50] in the kitchen.
[3098.16 → 3099.10] It looks amazing.
[3100.64 → 3101.80] I really want you guys
[3101.80 → 3102.30] to see it.
[3102.64 → 3103.46] She doesn't say,
[3103.62 → 3103.84] you know,
[3103.94 → 3105.38] I found this awesome
[3105.38 → 3106.26] new recipe
[3106.26 → 3107.24] online.
[3108.12 → 3108.98] I want to
[3108.98 → 3110.52] make this for you
[3110.52 → 3111.56] and I want to wow you
[3111.56 → 3112.60] with my new recipe.
[3113.88 → 3114.28] No,
[3114.38 → 3115.00] she says,
[3115.24 → 3116.62] you have got to come
[3116.62 → 3117.44] and stay.
[3117.88 → 3118.14] Why?
[3118.14 → 3120.32] Because we are family.
[3121.78 → 3122.44] Look with me,
[3122.58 → 3122.72] you know,
[3122.76 → 3123.40] look again here.
[3124.04 → 3124.38] She says,
[3124.52 → 3125.92] if you consider me
[3125.92 → 3127.48] a believer in the Lord,
[3128.40 → 3129.12] come and stay
[3129.12 → 3129.74] at my house.
[3130.98 → 3131.82] In other words,
[3131.86 → 3132.28] she's saying,
[3132.58 → 3133.14] if you think
[3133.14 → 3134.36] I am really a Christian,
[3134.52 → 3134.90] if you think
[3134.90 → 3135.62] I'm legit,
[3136.68 → 3139.32] then you need
[3139.32 → 3140.10] to stay at my house.
[3141.30 → 3142.12] In other words,
[3142.20 → 3143.28] if you didn't
[3143.28 → 3144.96] refuse my baptism,
[3145.30 → 3146.22] then you mustn't
[3146.22 → 3147.62] refuse my hospitality.
[3148.96 → 3150.02] And the amazing thing is,
[3150.06 → 3151.24] she's only been a Christian
[3151.24 → 3153.16] for like a matter of hours
[3153.16 → 3153.96] at the most.
[3154.60 → 3156.24] And she's already sensed
[3156.24 → 3158.22] that her public identification
[3158.22 → 3159.28] with Jesus Christ
[3159.28 → 3160.12] in her baptism,
[3160.48 → 3162.28] it means that she must
[3162.28 → 3164.06] now publicly identify
[3164.06 → 3165.78] with God's people.
[3166.46 → 3167.34] That she's been brought
[3167.34 → 3168.10] into relationship
[3168.10 → 3168.74] with God
[3168.74 → 3169.60] through Jesus Christ
[3169.60 → 3170.88] and she's been brought
[3170.88 → 3171.58] into relationship
[3171.58 → 3173.50] with his body,
[3173.60 → 3174.12] the church,
[3174.60 → 3175.20] his people.
[3176.50 → 3176.84] Right?
[3176.90 → 3177.72] And she knows Paul
[3177.72 → 3178.42] and his companions,
[3178.54 → 3179.30] they've just arrived
[3179.30 → 3179.84] in the city,
[3180.26 → 3181.68] and that if they ended up
[3181.68 → 3182.38] staying down
[3182.38 → 3183.52] at the Holiday Inn,
[3184.02 → 3187.34] it would be unseemly.
[3187.94 → 3189.60] It would be wrong.
[3191.28 → 3192.22] They'd be saying,
[3192.42 → 3193.10] well, actually,
[3193.36 → 3194.40] you're not really
[3194.40 → 3195.20] part of the family.
[3196.12 → 3197.28] It would be actually
[3197.28 → 3198.06] a denial
[3198.06 → 3199.04] of what Christ
[3199.04 → 3200.34] has done in her life
[3200.34 → 3201.94] if she didn't invite them
[3201.94 → 3202.78] into her home.
[3202.78 → 3204.98] And then I love
[3204.98 → 3205.90] what it says here
[3205.90 → 3206.34] at the end.
[3206.46 → 3207.02] Luke, right,
[3207.08 → 3208.70] is writing Acts,
[3209.48 → 3209.98] says,
[3210.32 → 3212.10] and she persuaded us.
[3213.60 → 3214.04] Right?
[3214.08 → 3215.44] I bet she persuaded them.
[3215.60 → 3216.56] Just imagine Lydia.
[3216.76 → 3217.76] She's this businesswoman.
[3218.16 → 3219.46] She deals with senators.
[3220.22 → 3221.24] I can imagine
[3221.24 → 3222.58] she is very persuasive.
[3223.86 → 3224.94] She persuaded us.
[3224.94 → 3226.86] You know,
[3226.94 → 3228.72] and Paul and his friends,
[3228.86 → 3230.08] these guys are pretty resilient.
[3230.28 → 3230.42] You know,
[3230.46 → 3231.34] they've been through a lot.
[3231.60 → 3232.34] They faced down
[3232.34 → 3233.06] some pretty,
[3233.06 → 3236.12] pretty strong personalities.
[3237.76 → 3238.42] You know,
[3238.46 → 3239.04] and they didn't want
[3239.04 → 3239.58] to be a burden
[3239.58 → 3240.40] on other people.
[3241.76 → 3243.20] But they said,
[3243.62 → 3244.12] she's right.
[3245.00 → 3245.94] And she is right.
[3247.42 → 3247.84] You know,
[3247.88 → 3249.08] and she's not alone
[3249.08 → 3250.12] in responding
[3250.12 → 3252.22] to the gospel
[3252.22 → 3253.00] in this way.
[3253.96 → 3255.42] Both Peter and Paul
[3255.42 → 3256.72] in their letters,
[3257.22 → 3258.66] they write about
[3258.66 → 3259.70] the central place
[3259.70 → 3260.48] of hospitality
[3260.48 → 3261.62] in the Christian life.
[3261.94 → 3262.82] So let's just look
[3262.82 → 3263.32] at a couple
[3263.32 → 3264.28] of these passages.
[3265.32 → 3266.18] So first,
[3266.30 → 3266.88] look with me
[3266.88 → 3268.82] at Romans 12,
[3269.00 → 3269.82] 11 to 13.
[3270.80 → 3271.86] So Paul here,
[3271.96 → 3273.56] he's kind of rapid fire,
[3274.08 → 3275.24] giving instructions
[3275.24 → 3276.18] for Christian living.
[3276.92 → 3277.94] And this is what he says.
[3277.94 → 3280.36] Be Never lacking in zeal,
[3280.84 → 3282.72] but keep your spiritual fervour,
[3283.30 → 3284.06] serving the Lord.
[3284.40 → 3285.48] Be joyful in hope,
[3285.86 → 3286.78] patient in affliction,
[3287.22 → 3288.04] faithful in prayer.
[3288.78 → 3289.90] Share with the Lord's people
[3289.90 → 3290.74] who are in need.
[3291.92 → 3292.98] Practice hospitality.
[3294.60 → 3295.88] So notice here,
[3296.52 → 3299.74] hospitality is not optional.
[3300.86 → 3301.42] In fact,
[3301.54 → 3302.42] Paul puts it here
[3302.42 → 3304.70] with being spiritually fervent,
[3305.64 → 3305.76] right?
[3305.82 → 3306.46] Being joyful,
[3306.92 → 3307.80] being patient,
[3307.94 → 3309.64] being faithful in prayer,
[3311.08 → 3312.14] practicing hospitality
[3312.14 → 3314.16] is just as important.
[3314.38 → 3315.32] It's not optional
[3315.32 → 3316.34] in the Christian life.
[3317.96 → 3318.56] And notice,
[3319.00 → 3321.02] you have to practice
[3321.02 → 3322.12] hospitality,
[3322.84 → 3323.00] right?
[3323.10 → 3324.34] It's an action.
[3324.50 → 3325.52] It's a spiritual discipline.
[3325.76 → 3326.78] It's going to take effort.
[3327.90 → 3328.72] People aren't just going
[3328.72 → 3329.56] to show up in your house
[3329.56 → 3329.98] and say,
[3330.10 → 3331.18] I would like a meal, please.
[3331.88 → 3333.04] It's not like going through
[3333.04 → 3333.90] a drive-thru.
[3334.88 → 3336.94] Hospitality is you going out
[3336.94 → 3337.56] of your way
[3337.56 → 3338.56] to bring people
[3338.56 → 3340.18] into your home
[3340.18 → 3341.92] because you're a Christian.
[3342.98 → 3344.24] And we're meant to welcome
[3344.24 → 3344.82] one another
[3344.82 → 3345.80] into our homes,
[3346.00 → 3347.02] into our lives,
[3347.02 → 3349.40] as brothers and sisters
[3349.40 → 3350.00] in Christ
[3350.00 → 3351.28] because we are family.
[3351.28 → 3353.42] And so,
[3353.54 → 3353.72] friends,
[3353.80 → 3353.92] you know,
[3353.98 → 3355.16] if this concept
[3355.16 → 3355.94] of hospitality,
[3356.10 → 3356.58] this concept
[3356.58 → 3357.48] of inviting
[3357.48 → 3358.16] other brothers
[3358.16 → 3358.66] and sisters
[3358.66 → 3359.12] in Christ
[3359.12 → 3360.16] into your home,
[3360.34 → 3361.50] if it feels
[3361.50 → 3363.68] alien to you
[3363.68 → 3364.62] or if it feels
[3364.62 → 3365.40] kind of maybe
[3365.40 → 3366.58] just unimaginable
[3366.58 → 3366.98] to you,
[3367.02 → 3367.14] like,
[3367.22 → 3368.10] why would I do that?
[3368.86 → 3369.38] Perhaps
[3369.38 → 3371.56] we have lost sight
[3371.56 → 3373.20] of the spiritual
[3373.20 → 3373.74] connection
[3373.74 → 3374.50] that we share
[3374.50 → 3375.04] in Jesus.
[3377.74 → 3378.26] Now,
[3378.42 → 3378.86] next,
[3378.98 → 3379.74] let's look at something
[3379.74 → 3380.78] that Peter says.
[3382.00 → 3382.54] So Peter,
[3383.26 → 3384.52] 1 Peter 4,
[3384.62 → 3385.14] verse 9,
[3385.92 → 3386.76] offer hospitality
[3386.76 → 3387.84] to one another
[3387.84 → 3389.68] without grumbling.
[3390.74 → 3391.18] Now,
[3391.22 → 3391.66] why do you think
[3391.66 → 3392.02] he says
[3392.02 → 3392.96] without grumbling?
[3394.58 → 3395.14] I think
[3395.14 → 3396.28] because he knows us.
[3397.38 → 3397.52] Right?
[3397.58 → 3398.90] I think Peter knows
[3398.90 → 3400.36] that we are inclined
[3400.36 → 3401.46] to grumble.
[3402.52 → 3402.94] That,
[3403.22 → 3403.84] very often,
[3404.26 → 3404.98] we might be able
[3404.98 → 3406.02] to do the right thing
[3406.02 → 3407.96] but with the wrong heart.
[3409.78 → 3411.22] I heard this week,
[3412.00 → 3412.68] I was reading
[3412.68 → 3413.52] about hospitality,
[3413.94 → 3415.44] someone said this
[3415.44 → 3416.46] about the art
[3416.46 → 3417.14] of hospitality.
[3418.42 → 3419.40] Hospitality is making
[3419.40 → 3420.98] someone feel at home
[3420.98 → 3423.16] even when you wish
[3423.16 → 3423.72] they were.
[3425.46 → 3426.54] I like that one.
[3426.54 → 3429.76] So if this,
[3430.48 → 3430.82] you know,
[3430.88 → 3431.80] just becomes
[3431.80 → 3432.72] a
[3433.40 → 3433.56] okay,
[3433.80 → 3434.04] well,
[3434.18 → 3434.34] okay,
[3434.36 → 3434.86] I'm a Christian,
[3435.06 → 3436.04] I have to practice
[3436.04 → 3437.06] hospitality here,
[3437.34 → 3438.02] and it's just kind of
[3438.02 → 3438.92] a check off the box
[3438.92 → 3439.62] kind of thing,
[3439.94 → 3440.52] but actually,
[3440.68 → 3441.46] we really resent
[3441.46 → 3442.18] having people
[3442.18 → 3443.22] in our home
[3443.22 → 3444.16] and sharing our lives
[3444.16 → 3444.64] with them,
[3445.20 → 3445.40] you know,
[3445.44 → 3446.06] that's not biblical
[3446.06 → 3446.74] hospitality,
[3447.18 → 3447.34] right?
[3447.38 → 3448.30] We can actually
[3448.30 → 3449.30] find joy in it.
[3449.34 → 3449.80] We should do it
[3449.80 → 3450.38] without grumbling.
[3451.20 → 3451.60] And I think
[3451.60 → 3452.76] in just so many things
[3452.76 → 3454.06] about the Christian life,
[3454.08 → 3454.70] and we were talking
[3454.70 → 3455.12] about this
[3455.12 → 3455.94] in the men's breakfast
[3455.94 → 3456.56] yesterday,
[3456.96 → 3458.48] it starts with obedience
[3458.48 → 3459.12] sometimes.
[3459.84 → 3461.10] Sometimes we need
[3461.10 → 3462.16] to just follow Christ
[3462.16 → 3463.00] in what he calls us
[3463.00 → 3463.26] to do,
[3463.30 → 3463.88] even when we don't
[3463.88 → 3464.70] feel like it,
[3465.62 → 3466.00] then,
[3466.44 → 3467.20] but we obey,
[3467.30 → 3468.02] and in obeying,
[3468.12 → 3469.40] we experience the joy
[3469.40 → 3470.96] of what God
[3470.96 → 3471.60] has called us to do
[3471.60 → 3472.80] because he has called
[3472.80 → 3473.30] us to do it.
[3473.36 → 3474.14] We know he's good,
[3474.96 → 3476.32] and so we can start
[3476.32 → 3477.36] to experience the joy
[3477.36 → 3478.36] of the Christian life
[3478.36 → 3479.58] as we first
[3479.58 → 3480.88] just even obey sometimes.
[3483.48 → 3484.30] Well, lastly,
[3484.30 → 3485.14] let's take a look
[3485.14 → 3485.76] at Romans
[3485.76 → 3487.10] chapter 15,
[3487.18 → 3487.76] verse 7.
[3488.66 → 3490.08] Paul simply says this,
[3490.78 → 3492.02] welcome one another
[3492.02 → 3493.68] as Christ
[3493.68 → 3494.62] has welcomed you.
[3496.28 → 3496.72] You know,
[3496.74 → 3497.12] when we think
[3497.12 → 3497.74] about that,
[3498.50 → 3499.66] it wasn't easy
[3499.66 → 3500.28] for Jesus
[3500.28 → 3501.34] to welcome us
[3501.34 → 3502.18] into God's family,
[3502.24 → 3502.60] was it?
[3503.78 → 3503.96] Right?
[3504.04 → 3504.98] It wasn't easy,
[3505.04 → 3505.90] it was costly
[3505.90 → 3506.92] for Jesus
[3506.92 → 3507.80] to welcome us.
[3508.58 → 3508.70] Right?
[3508.74 → 3509.14] What Jesus
[3509.14 → 3510.04] had to go through
[3510.04 → 3511.70] to welcome us,
[3511.74 → 3512.84] to practice hospitality,
[3512.84 → 3513.52] to welcome us
[3513.52 → 3514.20] to his family,
[3514.42 → 3515.40] that was very hard,
[3515.90 → 3516.76] and that was very costly.
[3517.80 → 3518.50] But Jesus
[3518.50 → 3519.20] didn't grumble.
[3520.28 → 3520.78] In fact,
[3520.90 → 3521.60] in Hebrews
[3521.60 → 3522.54] chapter 12,
[3522.66 → 3523.10] he says,
[3523.50 → 3524.22] for the joy
[3524.22 → 3525.54] set before him,
[3525.64 → 3526.90] he endured the cross.
[3528.36 → 3528.88] Right?
[3528.92 → 3529.98] It was his joy.
[3530.98 → 3531.66] It was hard,
[3531.94 → 3532.96] but it was his joy
[3532.96 → 3533.98] to redeem us.
[3534.54 → 3535.94] It was his joy
[3535.94 → 3538.80] to die,
[3539.42 → 3540.18] rise again,
[3540.18 → 3541.12] so that,
[3541.66 → 3542.40] through the power
[3542.40 → 3543.12] of the Holy Spirit,
[3543.12 → 3544.56] he could open our hearts
[3544.56 → 3545.64] to receive him
[3545.64 → 3547.60] as our Lord.
[3549.64 → 3549.92] And so,
[3550.04 → 3551.40] as we seek
[3551.40 → 3552.38] to extend welcome
[3552.38 → 3553.16] to one another,
[3553.54 → 3553.70] you know,
[3553.74 → 3554.58] it won't be easy,
[3555.12 → 3557.14] but we mustn't resent it.
[3557.94 → 3558.16] Right?
[3558.22 → 3558.96] It's a privilege.
[3559.12 → 3559.70] It's a privilege
[3559.70 → 3561.76] to do for someone else
[3561.76 → 3562.68] what Christ has done
[3562.68 → 3563.06] for us.
[3563.12 → 3563.56] That's what
[3563.56 → 3564.68] Paul says here.
[3565.24 → 3566.62] We get to do this.
[3567.32 → 3568.44] Christ has welcomed us,
[3568.46 → 3569.06] so we welcome
[3569.06 → 3569.52] one another.
[3569.62 → 3570.44] That's what Lydia did.
[3571.34 → 3572.64] God had welcomed her
[3572.64 → 3573.44] into his family,
[3573.70 → 3574.34] and so immediately,
[3574.50 → 3575.42] she wants to welcome
[3575.42 → 3577.02] them into hers.
[3579.74 → 3580.22] And so, friends,
[3580.28 → 3581.14] that means we need
[3581.14 → 3582.00] to welcome one another,
[3582.24 → 3582.64] don't we?
[3583.64 → 3584.72] This one another
[3584.72 → 3586.28] in this church family
[3586.28 → 3589.56] as Christ has welcomed us.
[3589.92 → 3590.96] Let's welcome one another.
[3592.30 → 3592.50] You know,
[3592.60 → 3593.84] and this may feel
[3593.84 → 3595.60] very kind of every day,
[3595.60 → 3597.42] kind of very low-key,
[3597.58 → 3598.46] like it doesn't really matter,
[3598.68 → 3599.92] like is this important?
[3600.78 → 3601.54] But actually,
[3601.64 → 3602.96] it's massively consequential.
[3604.36 → 3605.00] In fact,
[3605.08 → 3607.18] by the end of Acts 16,
[3607.88 → 3608.78] Lydia's home
[3608.78 → 3611.18] is where this new
[3611.18 → 3612.14] fledgling church
[3612.14 → 3612.74] in Philippi
[3612.74 → 3613.78] is actually now meeting.
[3614.82 → 3615.52] And her home
[3615.52 → 3616.86] has become ground zero
[3616.86 → 3617.60] for the welcome
[3617.60 → 3618.30] of Christ
[3618.30 → 3619.78] in the city of Philippi.
[3620.34 → 3621.30] And her hospitality
[3621.30 → 3622.72] is now enabling
[3622.72 → 3623.60] Paul, Silas,
[3623.64 → 3624.10] and Timothy,
[3624.50 → 3625.08] and Luke,
[3625.60 → 3626.42] to do what they
[3626.42 → 3627.24] were called to do,
[3627.30 → 3627.94] which is to preach
[3627.94 → 3628.90] the gospel in the city.
[3630.20 → 3630.34] Right?
[3630.40 → 3630.56] And so,
[3630.62 → 3631.22] this small group
[3631.22 → 3631.78] of believers,
[3632.14 → 3633.40] it grows over
[3633.40 → 3634.32] the course of the years.
[3634.36 → 3634.88] It becomes
[3634.88 → 3636.60] a very important church.
[3637.48 → 3638.28] And then it was
[3638.28 → 3639.16] to this church
[3639.16 → 3639.84] in Philippi
[3639.84 → 3640.56] that Paul would
[3640.56 → 3641.18] later write
[3641.18 → 3641.82] his letter,
[3642.38 → 3643.28] his famous letter,
[3644.00 → 3645.04] to the Philippians.
[3645.62 → 3646.50] And in the opening
[3646.50 → 3647.46] of that very letter,
[3647.62 → 3647.96] Paul,
[3648.24 → 3649.72] he seems to reflect.
[3650.30 → 3651.40] He reflects
[3651.40 → 3652.48] on that first
[3652.48 → 3653.42] Sabbath day
[3653.42 → 3655.32] down by the river
[3655.32 → 3656.88] when Lydia
[3656.88 → 3657.70] insisted
[3657.70 → 3659.16] that they come
[3659.16 → 3660.16] and stay with her.
[3660.72 → 3661.44] This is what,
[3661.56 → 3662.68] this is what we find
[3662.68 → 3663.74] in the opening lines
[3663.74 → 3664.38] of Philippians.
[3664.68 → 3665.62] This is what Paul writes.
[3665.62 → 3667.24] I thank my God
[3667.24 → 3669.34] every time
[3669.34 → 3670.22] I remember you
[3670.22 → 3671.80] and all my prayers
[3671.80 → 3672.62] for all of you.
[3673.18 → 3674.28] I always pray
[3674.28 → 3675.00] with joy
[3675.00 → 3676.30] because of your
[3676.30 → 3676.86] partnership
[3676.86 → 3677.54] in the gospel
[3677.54 → 3680.14] from the first day
[3680.14 → 3681.74] until now.
[3681.74 → 3687.52] And what I think
[3687.52 → 3688.10] this means
[3688.10 → 3689.54] is that
[3689.54 → 3690.76] our homes
[3690.76 → 3692.82] may be
[3692.82 → 3693.32] one of the most
[3693.32 → 3693.98] significant
[3693.98 → 3695.08] places
[3695.08 → 3696.38] in God's kingdom.
[3697.58 → 3698.38] I want you to realize
[3698.38 → 3698.54] that,
[3698.60 → 3699.16] think about that.
[3699.40 → 3700.22] Your home
[3700.22 → 3701.50] may be
[3701.50 → 3702.36] the most
[3702.36 → 3703.16] significant
[3703.16 → 3704.30] place
[3704.30 → 3706.06] for kingdom growth.
[3707.00 → 3707.80] Maybe more
[3707.80 → 3708.34] significant
[3708.34 → 3709.90] than the pulpit.
[3710.62 → 3711.08] We're not saying
[3711.08 → 3711.50] that preaching
[3711.50 → 3711.88] of the word
[3711.88 → 3712.84] is not important
[3712.84 → 3714.14] but your home
[3714.14 → 3715.32] and you sharing
[3715.32 → 3715.94] about Jesus,
[3716.14 → 3717.10] your conversion story
[3717.10 → 3717.70] in your life
[3717.70 → 3718.54] with someone else
[3718.54 → 3720.64] is extremely
[3720.64 → 3721.30] significant
[3721.30 → 3722.46] and powerful
[3722.46 → 3724.46] in the work
[3724.46 → 3725.08] of the gospel.
[3727.00 → 3727.68] And as you
[3727.68 → 3728.84] welcome one another
[3728.84 → 3730.44] as Christ
[3730.44 → 3731.26] has welcomed you
[3731.26 → 3732.50] the glory of God
[3732.50 → 3733.82] is on display.
[3736.58 → 3737.58] So let's take
[3737.58 → 3738.34] a few moments
[3738.34 → 3739.36] of quiet
[3739.36 → 3741.34] to respond
[3741.34 → 3742.54] to what God
[3742.54 → 3743.06] is saying
[3743.06 → 3743.56] to you
[3743.56 → 3744.16] through his word
[3744.16 → 3744.62] this morning.
[3746.04 → 3746.64] I'll give you
[3746.64 → 3747.28] a couple of moments
[3747.28 → 3747.96] of silence
[3747.96 → 3749.54] and then I will
[3749.54 → 3750.20] pray for us.
[3750.20 → 3772.42] our Father,
[3772.70 → 3774.26] we thank you
[3774.26 → 3774.80] for this
[3774.80 → 3776.06] beautiful
[3776.06 → 3777.82] little story
[3777.82 → 3779.44] in the midst
[3779.44 → 3780.02] of all
[3780.02 → 3780.80] the excitement
[3780.80 → 3781.96] of everything
[3781.96 → 3782.44] happening
[3782.44 → 3783.08] in Acts.
[3783.22 → 3783.34] Lord,
[3783.38 → 3784.04] we meet Lydia
[3784.04 → 3785.52] and you opened
[3785.52 → 3786.04] her heart
[3786.04 → 3787.98] and because of that
[3787.98 → 3788.70] she opened her
[3788.70 → 3789.78] home to your people
[3789.78 → 3791.10] and because of that
[3791.10 → 3792.20] you started a church
[3792.20 → 3793.82] and because of that
[3793.82 → 3794.40] the gospel
[3794.40 → 3796.44] went out
[3796.44 → 3797.94] into Europe
[3797.94 → 3799.72] and came to us
[3799.72 → 3800.50] today.
[3801.22 → 3802.06] It went all
[3802.06 → 3802.70] over the world
[3802.70 → 3804.64] and so we pray
[3804.64 → 3805.02] Lord,
[3805.14 → 3806.28] first and foremost
[3806.28 → 3806.84] that you would
[3806.84 → 3807.84] open our hearts
[3807.84 → 3808.40] afresh
[3808.40 → 3810.44] to see
[3810.44 → 3811.88] with a new
[3811.88 → 3812.46] depth
[3812.46 → 3813.30] of insight
[3813.30 → 3814.04] and clarity
[3814.04 → 3815.48] with new wonder
[3815.48 → 3816.78] of the welcome
[3816.78 → 3817.80] that we have received
[3817.80 → 3819.02] through Jesus Christ
[3819.02 → 3820.66] and then we pray
[3820.66 → 3821.44] that you would help us
[3821.44 → 3822.36] to open our lives,
[3822.60 → 3823.80] help us to open our homes
[3823.80 → 3824.74] to one another
[3824.74 → 3826.94] and we pray
[3826.94 → 3827.38] not
[3827.38 → 3829.18] that we pray
[3829.18 → 3829.86] that you would help us
[3829.86 → 3830.92] to not only know
[3830.92 → 3831.34] that we're doing
[3831.34 → 3831.90] the right thing
[3831.90 → 3832.48] but pray
[3832.48 → 3833.12] Lord,
[3833.24 → 3833.66] that you would
[3833.66 → 3835.02] help us to take joy
[3835.02 → 3835.82] in doing so.
[3836.92 → 3837.16] Lord,
[3837.24 → 3838.08] we pray most of all
[3838.08 → 3838.90] for your glory,
[3839.34 → 3840.78] the glory of God
[3840.78 → 3841.48] and the furthering
[3841.48 → 3842.12] of his kingdom
[3842.12 → 3843.66] and we pray all this
[3843.66 → 3844.40] in Jesus' name.
[3844.98 → 3845.22] Amen.
[3850.34 → 3851.64] And so let's stand.
[3851.82 → 3852.54] I think we'll stand
[3852.54 → 3853.80] to sing and respond.
[3861.34 → 3863.42] Amen.
[3883.74 → 3884.34] Amen.
[3884.34 → 3886.20] Amen.
[3886.20 → 3888.36] Amen.
[3888.36 → 3890.26] Amen.
[3890.26 → 3908.66] We'll pass and send each other as Christ accepted us.
[3908.66 → 3917.66] Teach us a sister brother, each person to embrace.
[3917.66 → 3927.26] Be present, Lord, among us and bring us to believe.
[3928.48 → 3937.66] We are ourselves accepted and meant to love and live.
[3937.66 → 3949.86] Let us behold your lessons as in our daily life.
[3950.42 → 3959.42] We struggle to be human and search for hope and faith.
[3959.42 → 3969.02] Teach us to care for people, for all, not just for some.
[3969.66 → 3979.02] To love them as we find them, or as they may become.
[3979.02 → 3991.12] And your acceptance changed us so that we may move.
[3991.12 → 4000.66] In living situations, to do the truth in love.
[4001.02 → 4010.32] To practice your acceptance, until we know by heart.
[4010.32 → 4020.52] The table of forgiveness and laughter's healing of you.
[4020.52 → 4030.52] The table of forgiveness and laughter's healing of you.
[4030.52 → 4039.24] You are born to days and mountains with all who are in need.
[4039.24 → 4048.66] You hunger for acceptance, for righteousness and bread.
[4048.66 → 4058.24] We need new words for seeing, new hands for holding on.
[4058.24 → 4063.24] Renew us with your spirit.
[4063.24 → 4073.24] Renew us with your spirit.
[4073.24 → 4079.24] You may be seated.
[4079.24 → 4083.24] Our offering this morning is for the House of Omid.
[4083.24 → 4090.24] And this house is located in Burnaby.
[4090.24 → 4096.24] And refugees, new immigrants are welcomed there and helped with their physical needs,
[4096.24 → 4101.24] with filling up all the plethora of forms that are needed for people new to this country,
[4101.24 → 4103.24] and so many other things.
[4103.24 → 4109.24] And so today, may we open our hearts to this need.
[4109.24 → 4127.24] Thank you.
[4127.24 → 4157.22] Thank you.
[4157.24 → 4187.22] Thank you.
[4187.24 → 4217.22] Thank you.
[4217.24 → 4247.22] Thank you.
[4247.22 → 4277.20] Thank you.
[4277.22 → 4279.22] Thank you.
[4307.22 → 4309.22] Thank you.
[4337.22 → 4341.00] May those who are called to support in other ways do so generously.
[4341.78 → 4344.82] We pray for the work of the House of Omid.
[4345.44 → 4349.70] May our gifts today serve to enrich their ministry to new immigrants.
[4349.70 → 4358.90] Light of the world shine your light on your church worldwide where persecution is growing rapidly, especially in eastern countries.
[4359.86 → 4366.68] May Christians who suffer from hardship or persecution find faith through the grace of your Holy Spirit.
[4366.68 → 4371.72] And those who are weak recognize that their strength is in you.
[4371.72 → 4377.60] May believers everywhere encourage each other with your words of life-giving truth.
[4377.60 → 4379.60] We pray for our own country.
[4379.60 → 4380.94] We pray for our own country.
[4381.60 → 4384.08] Thank you for its rich cultural diversity.
[4384.08 → 4393.12] This weekend, Lord, open our hearts and minds to engage in the thoughts and events about our history and reconciling with our indigenous neighbours.
[4393.12 → 4400.12] Sometimes we need to hear a story many times or from a different angle before we really understand.
[4400.12 → 4406.54] We long to be people of integrity, but sometimes we don't even know what that looks like.
[4406.54 → 4409.90] Guide us, Lord, in how we engage with our world.
[4411.22 → 4419.90] We pray for our own church, and thank you for the good spirit that prevailed over our congregational meeting on Wednesday evening, even though our numbers were small.
[4420.60 → 4429.62] Give us all a sense of urgency about living out our faith together in practical ways and making decisions together that impact all of us and our community.
[4430.64 → 4433.62] We pray that you will guide us in the matter of our church name.
[4433.62 → 4437.14] May your will be done in this matter for the building up of your kingdom.
[4438.20 → 4441.62] We bring before you those in our fellowship who are hurting.
[4442.74 → 4446.08] Comfort Jim and Anita who have both lost their mothers recently.
[4447.20 → 4456.42] These women are both deeply loved by their families for they were matriarchs who had great influence on their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
[4456.42 → 4464.64] As both families remember and grieve, settle within them a peace concerning your gift of life that never ends.
[4465.48 → 4469.68] In the same way, comfort Sandy in the loss of her brother as well.
[4469.68 → 4478.24] Losses other than death leave us fragmented, and we pray for comfort and healing in whatever we are experiencing that leaves us fragmented.
[4478.96 → 4482.70] Thank you for your measure of healing for Sylvia and for Grace.
[4483.26 → 4486.68] Continue to give them full recovery as well as Annette.
[4486.68 → 4495.30] Grant that together we may share burdens as you teach us to do in illness, loneliness, or other difficulties.
[4496.24 → 4499.64] Give us joy in administering your grace to each other.
[4500.38 → 4508.56] As we go out from this place, may those around us see that we have been with Jesus in whose precious and powerful name we pray.
[4508.96 → 4509.22] Amen.
[4509.22 → 4509.34] Amen.
[4516.68 → 4517.68] Amen.
[4517.68 → 4518.68] Amen.
[4522.68 → 4523.16] Amen.
[4523.16 → 4523.30] All right.
[4523.48 → 4524.04] Please stand.
[4525.50 → 4527.68] And we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4527.78 → 4531.00] Please do join us for a time of fellowship right through the doors.
[4531.32 → 4532.40] Get to know one another.
[4533.42 → 4536.60] And we're trying to get our small groups rolling again.
[4536.72 → 4544.86] And so if you are not in a small group, and you would like to find one, please, I think there's a sign-up sheet on the FOIA table.
[4544.86 → 4551.04] You can also come talk to myself or to John Mantra, our clerk of classes, or sorry, council.
[4552.02 → 4552.20] All right.
[4552.42 → 4555.30] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4556.06 → 4565.64] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with each of you now, this week, and forever.
[4566.06 → 4566.34] Amen.
[4566.34 → 4566.44] Amen.
[4566.44 → 4566.48] Amen.
[4566.48 → 4568.48] Amen.
[4568.48 → 4569.08] Amen.
[4569.08 → 4569.48] Amen.
[4574.86 → 4579.56] Amen.
[4595.54 → 4595.78] Amen.
[4595.78 → 4596.96] Amen.
[4597.38 → 4599.60] Amen.
[4599.90 → 4601.30] Amen.
[4601.30 → 4610.58] Jesus, the one who died and lived, you have tinned all our shame.
[4611.58 → 4621.08] Spirit, who still melts hearts and sores, will never be the same.
[4621.08 → 4632.16] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the one true God.
[4632.72 → 4640.30] Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4640.30 → 4654.16] Father, the one who still is loved, glory to your name.
[4655.02 → 4664.64] Jesus, the one who died and lived, you have taken all our shame.
[4664.64 → 4674.84] Spirit, who still melts hearts and sores, will never be the same.
[4675.84 → 4685.88] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the one true God.
[4685.88 → 4693.88] Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4694.64 → 4724.62] Christ, we live near you.
[4724.62 → 4754.60] Thank you.
[4754.62 → 4784.60] Thank you.
[4784.62 → 4814.60] Thank you.
