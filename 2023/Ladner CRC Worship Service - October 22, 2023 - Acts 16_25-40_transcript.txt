[252.56 --> 277.40]  Good morning, everyone.
[277.40 --> 278.48]  Good morning.
[278.76 --> 281.10]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[281.10 --> 284.88]  And it is really nice to be with you.
[285.40 --> 288.80]  It is great to worship the Lord together this morning.
[288.90 --> 289.94]  This is the Lord's day.
[290.24 --> 291.58]  It is the day that he has made.
[292.00 --> 294.24]  And he calls us to worship.
[294.68 --> 298.60]  But before we actually have our call to worship, just a few announcements.
[299.26 --> 309.58]  One is that we are excited for a Christmas choir that our, well, he's not there, but our music director, Paul, will be leading.
[309.58 --> 319.64]  And so if you are interested in singing in a choir, and I think we'll be singing during the worship service on Sunday morning, which is Christmas Eve morning.
[320.64 --> 324.02]  Not Christmas Eve evening, which is confusing.
[324.50 --> 328.74]  But anyways, you can sign up on the sign-up sheet that we have there.
[328.74 --> 331.26]  Also, there's a couple opportunities for serving.
[331.88 --> 336.98]  We are looking for someone who could be a point person for organizing rides for seniors.
[337.22 --> 341.50]  If that's something that you feel interested in, you can please let us know.
[341.84 --> 354.28]  As well as someone to help us organize a meal train, as well as a new mom's ministry where we help them celebrate children that are born.
[354.28 --> 358.62]  Also, there's a couple more shoeboxes for the Operation Christmas.
[358.74 --> 362.54]  If you'd like to grab one of those, I think there are maybe just a couple left over.
[364.26 --> 367.58]  And so anyway, there's many announcements that you can see in your bulletin.
[367.88 --> 369.20]  And you can take a look at your leisure.
[371.06 --> 374.50]  And so we are called together this morning by God himself.
[374.50 --> 379.76]  He calls us to hear his word as it's proclaimed.
[380.60 --> 386.62]  And he calls us to respond in worship and in prayer and in praise to him.
[387.72 --> 395.40]  And in a world where there are so many demands for us to be somebody, to do something,
[395.40 --> 405.46]  we approach the throne of grace to actually hear the gospel and what God has done for us through Jesus Christ.
[406.66 --> 408.84]  And so this morning, let us rejoice.
[409.80 --> 414.14]  Let us rest in the finished work of Christ for us.
[415.02 --> 420.48]  And so let's begin our worship this morning by hearing and responding to our call to worship from Psalm 96.
[420.48 --> 426.36]  Sing to the Lord a new song.
[427.20 --> 429.68]  Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[430.12 --> 431.08]  Sing to the Lord.
[431.26 --> 432.48]  Praise his name.
[433.14 --> 436.28]  For the name of his salvation, day after day.
[436.82 --> 439.94]  Declare his glory among the nations.
[440.62 --> 443.82]  His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[444.68 --> 448.74]  Blessed be God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[448.74 --> 453.16]  And blessed be his kingdom now and forever.
[453.72 --> 454.28]  Amen.
[454.88 --> 459.26]  Please pray with me as we come to God in a prayer of adoration.
[461.94 --> 465.04]  Our triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[466.00 --> 469.82]  We come because you have called us.
[470.32 --> 472.80]  And we gather together as your church.
[472.80 --> 477.52]  As your people, your body, your temple.
[478.64 --> 480.82]  And Lord, we're here to praise you.
[481.78 --> 486.54]  And we praise you with our bodies so fearfully and wonderfully made.
[487.22 --> 493.66]  With our minds being transformed and renewed by your saving grace.
[493.66 --> 500.20]  And with our hearts that have been opened to your steadfast love.
[501.00 --> 502.72]  And amazing love for us.
[503.22 --> 507.08]  And we praise you, God, because you are ever at work in this world.
[507.80 --> 510.46]  Reconciling all things and all people to yourself.
[511.18 --> 513.22]  And because of that, we put our hope in you.
[513.22 --> 516.94]  Jesus, you are the foundation of our hope.
[517.44 --> 520.72]  For our own lives and for this world that you have made.
[521.72 --> 526.84]  And so we praise you, Lord, for who you are and for what you do.
[527.92 --> 532.48]  And in the name of Jesus, we pray, who lived and died and rose again.
[532.60 --> 534.58]  Your Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[535.28 --> 535.58]  Amen.
[536.70 --> 541.64]  Brothers and sisters, please stand and receive God's greeting to us this morning.
[541.64 --> 547.62]  Grace and peace to you from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[548.54 --> 550.98]  So as God has called us and blessed us.
[551.16 --> 554.20]  And he gathers us into a spiritual family.
[554.88 --> 557.96]  Let's turn and let's welcome one another as we've gathered here today.
[558.26 --> 559.50]  Please turn and welcome your neighbors.
[572.06 --> 573.30]  Let's thank God.
[573.30 --> 575.12]  Thank you.
[575.12 --> 605.10]  Thank you.
[605.12 --> 635.10]  Thank you.
[635.12 --> 665.10]  Thank you.
[665.12 --> 672.78]  Praise the Lord in the rain or snow, or in the morning light.
[673.32 --> 677.30]  Praise the Lord in the deepest valley.
[677.74 --> 681.34]  Praise the Lord on the highest hill.
[681.90 --> 687.12]  Praise the Lord with the pressure, most be still.
[687.12 --> 694.12]  Praise the Lord with the pressure, most be still.
[694.78 --> 698.50]  Praise the Lord with the white and slain.
[699.00 --> 704.34]  Praise the Lord with the joyful song to sing.
[704.34 --> 711.34]  Praise the Lord with the joy.
[712.00 --> 716.34]  Praise the Lord in the time of sorrow.
[716.34 --> 720.34]  Praise the Lord in the time of joy.
[720.34 --> 728.34]  Praise the Lord in the time of sorrow.
[728.34 --> 732.60]  Praise the Lord in the time of joy.
[733.00 --> 736.34]  Praise the Lord in the moment.
[736.34 --> 740.34]  Nothing yet your face to stop.
[740.34 --> 745.50]  Praise the Lord in the peace and fire.
[745.50 --> 749.72]  Praise the Lord in the hope of pain.
[749.72 --> 753.58]  Praise the Lord in the hope of pain.
[753.58 --> 757.96]  Praise the Lord in the beauty of pain.
[758.70 --> 763.82]  SHOE PUSK
[763.82 --> 778.28]  When we'll fear a battle, we will fear the night.
[778.28 --> 783.28]  We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[783.60 --> 787.78]  We will go before us, we will leave the land.
[788.16 --> 792.76]  We have not a path, we will go, we can't escape.
[793.82 --> 798.54]  Still with joy now, our boat is the most.
[798.94 --> 803.02]  The boat is the most strong and mighty fortress.
[803.02 --> 807.42]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[807.92 --> 812.94]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[812.94 --> 821.42]  Even when I sell, go, even when I fall.
[821.82 --> 826.14]  Even when I turn back, still your love is short.
[826.14 --> 830.76]  We will abandon, you will love the sin.
[831.16 --> 835.98]  You will cheer me on with ever-ending praise.
[837.02 --> 841.68]  Sing with you now, our God is for us.
[842.06 --> 846.14]  The Father's throne is a strong and mighty fortress.
[846.52 --> 850.54]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[850.54 --> 855.98]  Look inside our gifts, as if our God is for us.
[855.98 --> 868.94]  We will hide your death and separate us.
[868.94 --> 873.52]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[873.52 --> 877.96]  Leave your name, let's love to pray us.
[878.22 --> 881.58]  Hold me in His blood.
[881.58 --> 886.86]  We will hide your death and separate us.
[886.86 --> 891.36]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[891.58 --> 895.80]  Feel again, let's love to pray us.
[895.80 --> 899.36]  Hold me in His blood.
[902.56 --> 907.22]  Sing with you now, our God is for us.
[907.22 --> 911.46]  The Father's throne is a strong and mighty fortress.
[911.82 --> 915.22]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[916.26 --> 920.22]  Look and stand against us if our God is for us.
[921.38 --> 925.20]  Come join now, our God is for us.
[925.64 --> 929.58]  The Father's throne is a strong and mighty fortress.
[929.92 --> 933.22]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[933.22 --> 935.22]  Raise your voice now, the love is for us.
[935.22 --> 938.22]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us.
[952.22 --> 953.50]  You may be seated.
[953.50 --> 954.50]  Good.
[958.50 --> 964.18]  So, we're doing something a little bit different, which is going to have an additional scripture
[964.18 --> 965.10]  reading this morning.
[966.26 --> 969.58]  And let's go ahead and put it up there.
[971.90 --> 975.86]  So, Psalm 142, I think in your bulletin it says 143.
[976.20 --> 978.18]  I chose 142, and I'll tell you why.
[978.18 --> 985.20]  It's that actually later in the sermon, we're going to be reading about how Paul and Silas
[985.20 --> 988.00]  are in prison, and they're singing hymns to God.
[988.86 --> 994.44]  And some commentators, you know, they believe that maybe Paul and Silas, they're singing
[994.44 --> 1003.40]  maybe Psalm 140, 141, 142, 143, these impeccatory psalms, crying out to God for His rescue and
[1003.40 --> 1004.16]  His deliverance.
[1004.34 --> 1007.40]  So, I thought, well, let's just read one of these psalms now.
[1007.40 --> 1012.34]  So, let me read it for us, and you can follow along on the screen.
[1012.40 --> 1014.94]  I cry aloud to the Lord.
[1015.50 --> 1019.00]  I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
[1019.66 --> 1022.04]  I pour out before Him my complaint.
[1023.12 --> 1025.72]  Before Him I tell my trouble.
[1026.70 --> 1032.88]  When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way.
[1032.88 --> 1038.66]  In the path where I walk, people have hidden a snare for me.
[1039.80 --> 1042.86]  Look and see, there is no one at my right hand.
[1043.70 --> 1045.28]  No one is concerned for me.
[1045.94 --> 1047.20]  I have no refuge.
[1047.32 --> 1048.54]  No one cares for my life.
[1049.34 --> 1050.62]  I cry to you, Lord.
[1051.32 --> 1056.54]  I say, you are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
[1056.54 --> 1061.80]  Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.
[1063.00 --> 1068.68]  Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
[1069.66 --> 1073.82]  Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name.
[1073.82 --> 1080.48]  Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
[1081.40 --> 1086.64]  You know, and what I love about many of these psalms is that there are psalms of praise.
[1087.32 --> 1088.34]  There are psalms of confession.
[1089.00 --> 1090.32]  There are psalms of thanksgiving.
[1090.48 --> 1094.36]  And there are also these psalms that give us the words to cry out to God.
[1094.36 --> 1101.00]  And so it's so good for us to have this psalm book, the psalms that we can read as God's people today,
[1101.10 --> 1104.86]  and we can use them to help shape our own prayers to God.
[1104.94 --> 1107.04]  And sometimes we need psalms like these.
[1107.64 --> 1109.88]  So that's a scripture reading for us.
[1109.92 --> 1112.92]  You can remain seated as we sing another song together.
[1124.36 --> 1136.78]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1136.78 --> 1142.32]  Where does my help come from?
[1143.52 --> 1147.62]  My help comes from you,
[1148.12 --> 1150.62]  maker of heaven,
[1151.68 --> 1153.78]  creator of peace.
[1154.36 --> 1155.36]  creator of peace.
[1155.36 --> 1161.68]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1161.68 --> 1165.56]  You are my only love.
[1165.56 --> 1169.56]  You're my only plan.
[1172.06 --> 1175.20]  So I will wait for you
[1175.20 --> 1179.02]  to come and rescue me.
[1179.02 --> 1184.00]  Come and give me life.
[1184.00 --> 1192.42]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1192.42 --> 1198.00]  Where does my help come from?
[1198.00 --> 1202.42]  I lift mylysium in my city.
[1202.42 --> 1203.06]  gameuk."
[1203.26 --> 1207.42]  Christian 10th
[1207.42 --> 1207.88]  live roughly
[1207.88 --> 1210.94]  Christ Arlesial,
[1211.00 --> 1212.10]  Glow to be your mother m aquellos,
[1212.10 --> 1213.06]  in a week,
[1213.06 --> 1213.28]  good forecasts.
[1213.28 --> 1220.40]  The victorious man is fighting please.
[1220.40 --> 1224.88]  The wind is still blowing,
[1225.44 --> 1229.08]  on a daily day.
[1229.94 --> 1233.40]  The wind is still blowing,
[1234.50 --> 1238.18]  deeper off the way.
[1238.18 --> 1242.58]  Trusting in the glory,
[1243.62 --> 1247.64]  hearts are fully blessed.
[1248.18 --> 1251.76]  Lighting as we promise,
[1252.80 --> 1257.06]  perfect peace and rest.
[1257.84 --> 1261.36]  Living in the power,
[1262.36 --> 1265.82]  of this mighty man.
[1265.82 --> 1270.22]  In our work and love,
[1270.22 --> 1275.14]  of this great we stand.
[1275.86 --> 1279.34]  We can trust in glory,
[1280.26 --> 1283.28]  all for us to do.
[1284.68 --> 1288.50]  Those who trust in glory,
[1289.28 --> 1292.16]  act in glory too.
[1292.16 --> 1297.56]  Trusting in the power,
[1298.62 --> 1302.54]  hearts are fully blessed.
[1302.54 --> 1307.48]  Lighting as we promise,
[1308.04 --> 1313.42]  perfect peace and rest.
[1313.42 --> 1325.80]  So as we look to God,
[1325.86 --> 1326.96]  and we trust in him,
[1327.50 --> 1328.70]  we also come before him,
[1328.70 --> 1329.82]  not only in trust,
[1330.30 --> 1331.34]  but also in confession,
[1331.50 --> 1334.68]  because although God promises us peace,
[1334.70 --> 1335.36]  as we sang,
[1335.46 --> 1336.72]  we often feel anxious.
[1336.72 --> 1339.96]  though he calls us to trust in him,
[1339.98 --> 1341.82]  we often look to other things,
[1341.82 --> 1343.68]  to trust in,
[1343.78 --> 1344.66]  for our salvation.
[1346.46 --> 1349.24]  So as we come to this time of confession,
[1349.24 --> 1351.18]  I just want to read a few verses first,
[1351.18 --> 1352.50]  from Psalm 96.
[1354.98 --> 1356.30]  So let me read this.
[1356.30 --> 1358.30]  Let the heavens rejoice.
[1358.30 --> 1361.88]  Let the earth be glad.
[1362.48 --> 1365.78]  Let the sea resound at all that is in it.
[1366.78 --> 1370.28]  Let the fields be jubilant and everything in them.
[1370.94 --> 1374.00]  Let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.
[1375.22 --> 1378.02]  Let all creation rejoice before the Lord,
[1378.38 --> 1379.46]  for he comes.
[1380.20 --> 1382.38]  He comes to judge the earth.
[1382.80 --> 1385.14]  He will judge the world in righteousness.
[1385.14 --> 1387.02]  In the peoples,
[1387.68 --> 1389.64]  in his faithfulness.
[1391.16 --> 1394.06]  It says God will come to judge the earth.
[1394.16 --> 1396.10]  And sometimes when we think God is going to judge,
[1396.18 --> 1398.38]  we feel scared.
[1399.40 --> 1401.14]  That's kind of a terrifying idea.
[1401.70 --> 1403.72]  But it says he will come to judge,
[1403.76 --> 1404.06]  how?
[1404.78 --> 1405.54]  In righteousness.
[1406.68 --> 1408.54]  Okay, so God's judgment is good.
[1408.98 --> 1410.32]  Because God is just.
[1410.72 --> 1411.48]  And he is righteous.
[1411.94 --> 1412.70]  And when he comes,
[1412.70 --> 1414.70]  he's going to put all wrong,
[1415.14 --> 1415.74]  to write.
[1416.88 --> 1418.36]  He will make all things well.
[1419.82 --> 1421.36]  And so when he comes to judge,
[1421.48 --> 1424.64]  we also want to look to him
[1424.64 --> 1426.54]  for his righteousness for ourselves
[1426.54 --> 1427.62]  through Jesus Christ.
[1428.40 --> 1430.38]  So let's come before him,
[1430.52 --> 1431.22]  the judge,
[1431.96 --> 1433.58]  the good judge,
[1433.82 --> 1436.22]  and let us confess our sins before him.
[1436.22 --> 1440.52]  I'm going to use kind of a traditional prayer.
[1441.48 --> 1444.62]  And instead of praying silently at the end,
[1444.62 --> 1446.84]  I want to give a space within this prayer
[1446.84 --> 1449.58]  for you to also pray silently.
[1449.76 --> 1451.34]  So I'm just going to read a line or two.
[1451.70 --> 1454.80]  And I want to invite you to meditate on the words I say,
[1454.90 --> 1455.86]  and then use them
[1455.86 --> 1459.88]  to lead you into a time of confession
[1459.88 --> 1461.08]  for yourselves.
[1461.08 --> 1461.56]  Okay?
[1461.92 --> 1462.52]  So let me,
[1462.82 --> 1463.36]  let's pray,
[1463.76 --> 1465.74]  and I will just a couple times
[1465.74 --> 1466.76]  say a few lines
[1466.76 --> 1468.92]  and then give you a moment of silence.
[1472.18 --> 1474.74]  Almighty and merciful Father,
[1475.44 --> 1476.94]  we have erred
[1476.94 --> 1479.42]  and strayed from your ways
[1479.42 --> 1481.46]  like lost sheep.
[1495.38 --> 1498.08]  We have followed too much
[1498.08 --> 1500.32]  the devices and desires
[1500.32 --> 1502.34]  of our own hearts.
[1502.90 --> 1504.18]  We have offended
[1504.18 --> 1506.74]  against your holy laws.
[1509.42 --> 1522.98]  We have left undone those things
[1522.98 --> 1524.98]  which we ought to have done.
[1525.86 --> 1527.90]  And we have done those things
[1527.90 --> 1530.54]  which we ought not to have done.
[1530.54 --> 1530.60]  Amen.
[1539.42 --> 1546.64]  Apart from your grace,
[1547.12 --> 1548.70]  there is no health in us.
[1549.54 --> 1550.14]  O Lord,
[1550.60 --> 1552.14]  have mercy upon us.
[1561.68 --> 1562.90]  And we thank you, Father,
[1563.00 --> 1565.50]  that you will come to judge the world.
[1566.04 --> 1567.28]  Lord, the world needs your judgment.
[1567.28 --> 1570.16]  And we thank you
[1570.16 --> 1571.34]  that you will judge the world
[1571.34 --> 1571.96]  in righteousness
[1571.96 --> 1573.94]  and that you will judge your people
[1573.94 --> 1576.54]  in your faithfulness.
[1577.36 --> 1578.28]  And we thank you
[1578.28 --> 1580.06]  that we can pray freely to you,
[1580.26 --> 1581.08]  coming before you
[1581.08 --> 1582.24]  to confess our sins,
[1582.84 --> 1584.88]  not on our own standing,
[1585.44 --> 1587.36]  but because we have the blood
[1587.36 --> 1589.12]  of your Son, Jesus Christ,
[1589.44 --> 1590.68]  that has washed us
[1590.68 --> 1592.54]  and forgiven us.
[1593.70 --> 1594.62]  Lord, we thank you
[1594.62 --> 1595.76]  for your grace and your mercy.
[1596.04 --> 1597.04]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1597.44 --> 1597.72]  Amen.
[1600.38 --> 1601.64]  So we serve a God
[1601.64 --> 1603.64]  who not only is awesome
[1603.64 --> 1605.56]  in power and in might,
[1606.44 --> 1607.96]  yet even in all that power,
[1608.70 --> 1610.58]  he looks on us with mercy.
[1611.28 --> 1612.92]  He draws us into his family
[1612.92 --> 1614.14]  because of what Jesus Christ
[1614.14 --> 1615.06]  has done for us.
[1616.00 --> 1616.54]  And so here,
[1616.96 --> 1617.76]  God's heart,
[1618.14 --> 1619.08]  his heart for you
[1619.08 --> 1620.24]  and for the world
[1620.24 --> 1621.46]  from John 3, 16.
[1622.02 --> 1623.46]  A very familiar verse.
[1623.46 --> 1626.66]  For God so loved the world
[1626.66 --> 1629.64]  that he gave his one and only Son
[1629.64 --> 1631.78]  that whoever believes in him
[1631.78 --> 1633.10]  should not perish
[1633.10 --> 1635.12]  but have eternal life.
[1635.98 --> 1636.30]  Amen.
[1637.46 --> 1638.44]  Let's stand
[1638.44 --> 1640.32]  and let's respond to God
[1640.32 --> 1642.06]  with this song
[1642.06 --> 1642.90]  of assuring us
[1642.90 --> 1643.66]  of God's love
[1643.66 --> 1645.08]  and his mercy for us.
[1645.08 --> 1659.84]  Behold the wondrous mystery
[1659.84 --> 1661.84]  say and without Him
[1661.84 --> 1662.36]  in his mercy for us.
[1662.36 --> 1663.92]  Unreal.
[1663.92 --> 1670.92]  In the name of God's praises, for the plan of man acting.
[1672.32 --> 1679.98]  In our home, in our darkness, now the light of life has come.
[1680.42 --> 1687.54]  Look to Christ, to God's sin, to God's flesh, to God's love.
[1693.92 --> 1701.92]  Oh, behold the wondrous mystery, he the perfect Son of God.
[1702.38 --> 1709.84]  In his grieving, in his suffering, never drinks nor sing of sin.
[1710.46 --> 1718.00]  Seek the true and better heaven, not to save the ever one.
[1718.00 --> 1726.70]  Bless the great and sure fulfillment, of the loving in his hand.
[1732.72 --> 1740.00]  Come below the wondrous mystery, bless the Lord above the tree.
[1740.00 --> 1748.14]  In the stead of human sinners, brings the lamb in victory.
[1749.22 --> 1757.20]  See the price of our redemption, see the Father's plan of hope.
[1757.64 --> 1766.20]  Bringing many steps to glory, praise the measure, love unto all.
[1770.00 --> 1787.00]  So yeah, at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1787.00 --> 1802.24]  Okay, great.
[1804.08 --> 1808.80]  So, we are in Acts chapter 16.
[1809.20 --> 1811.34]  I think this is the fifth week in Acts 16.
[1811.46 --> 1812.24]  There's a lot going on.
[1812.80 --> 1816.54]  You'll find that on page 825 of your Pew Bible.
[1817.00 --> 1822.74]  But before we read our passage this morning, let me remind you of what is happening in Acts.
[1823.48 --> 1826.84]  Okay, so the Apostle Paul, he's on his second missionary journey.
[1828.42 --> 1830.84]  And he's got along with him some companions.
[1832.02 --> 1834.38]  Luke, Timothy, and Silas.
[1835.16 --> 1839.40]  And they have now come to the Roman colony of Philippi.
[1839.78 --> 1841.34]  This is in modern day Greece.
[1841.34 --> 1845.86]  And so actually, this is the first time that the gospel has come into Europe.
[1845.86 --> 1855.66]  And in Acts 16, Luke, who is the author of Acts, he highlights three conversion stories for us.
[1855.80 --> 1860.12]  Three conversions that take place in the city of Philippi through their ministry.
[1860.64 --> 1867.32]  So first, he tells us about Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth, and how the Lord opened her heart.
[1867.32 --> 1876.34]  And next, he tells us the story of the slave girl and how the Lord set her free from bondage to a demonic spirit.
[1877.72 --> 1882.62]  And then the third one, today, we come to the Philippian jailer.
[1882.62 --> 1888.04]  And this conversion takes place inside a prison.
[1888.76 --> 1893.76]  But it's not because Paul and Silas are doing, you know, prison visitation.
[1894.20 --> 1897.84]  Actually, they are in jail themselves.
[1897.96 --> 1898.82]  They are inmates.
[1899.48 --> 1900.42]  How did this happen?
[1900.42 --> 1906.14]  Well, if you remember, after they had cast out the demon of the slave girl,
[1906.34 --> 1911.30]  the girl's owners had lost their opportunity of making a lot of money
[1911.30 --> 1917.30]  through this fortune-telling ability that this girl had through the evil spirit.
[1918.18 --> 1920.40]  And so they're angry.
[1920.66 --> 1924.44]  And they drag Paul and Silas before the magistrates.
[1924.44 --> 1926.12]  They are beaten.
[1926.74 --> 1928.64]  They are treated unjustly.
[1928.78 --> 1930.90]  They are unfairly accused.
[1931.72 --> 1933.38]  They have the stuffing beat out of them.
[1933.88 --> 1935.32]  And they're thrown into prison.
[1936.34 --> 1938.74]  So that's what's happened to Paul and Silas.
[1939.28 --> 1942.24]  And we pick up the account in verse 25.
[1942.48 --> 1946.90]  So let's read Acts 16, beginning in verse 25 to the end of the chapter.
[1946.90 --> 1954.48]  About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God.
[1955.24 --> 1957.10]  And the other prisoners were listening to them.
[1958.10 --> 1963.52]  Suddenly, there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
[1964.68 --> 1971.24]  At once, all the prison doors flew open and everyone's chains came loose.
[1971.24 --> 1973.48]  The jailer woke up.
[1974.20 --> 1980.60]  And when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself
[1980.60 --> 1983.26]  because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
[1984.48 --> 1985.58]  But Paul shouted,
[1986.04 --> 1987.42]  Don't harm yourself.
[1988.24 --> 1989.70]  We are all here.
[1990.62 --> 1995.92]  The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
[1995.92 --> 1998.70]  He then brought them out and asked,
[1998.88 --> 2002.18]  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
[2002.98 --> 2003.82]  They replied,
[2004.70 --> 2008.52]  Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.
[2009.38 --> 2013.96]  Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
[2015.12 --> 2020.22]  At that very hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds.
[2020.86 --> 2024.00]  Then immediately, he and all of his household were baptized.
[2024.00 --> 2029.12]  The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them.
[2029.96 --> 2036.84]  He was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God, he and his whole household.
[2038.36 --> 2043.32]  When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order,
[2043.82 --> 2044.74]  Release those men.
[2045.54 --> 2047.10]  The jailer told Paul,
[2048.10 --> 2050.80]  The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released.
[2051.16 --> 2052.02]  Now you can leave.
[2052.12 --> 2052.76]  Go in peace.
[2052.76 --> 2055.04]  But Paul said to the officers,
[2055.86 --> 2060.82]  They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison.
[2061.38 --> 2063.62]  And now do you want to get rid of us quietly?
[2064.22 --> 2064.68]  No.
[2065.18 --> 2067.56]  Let them come themselves and escort us out.
[2068.58 --> 2071.24]  The officers reported this to the magistrates.
[2071.82 --> 2075.92]  And when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
[2075.92 --> 2082.64]  They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
[2083.98 --> 2091.30]  After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them.
[2091.30 --> 2093.04]  Then they left.
[2094.08 --> 2095.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2096.26 --> 2097.22]  Thanks be to God.
[2097.52 --> 2098.36]  Let's pray together.
[2098.78 --> 2103.30]  Let's ask God to bless the reading, the preaching of his word.
[2103.66 --> 2104.14]  Let's pray.
[2104.14 --> 2113.88]  Lord, our God, we praise you for the power and the hope that your word gives.
[2113.88 --> 2143.86]  Let's pray together.
[2143.88 --> 2173.86]  Let's pray together.
[2173.86 --> 2174.36]  anh��서 attention.
[2175.26 --> 2178.98]  It's an older movie, great movie, prison break at the end.
[2179.88 --> 2186.14]  But before that happens, before the prison break, Andy, who is the main character, is a prisoner.
[2186.82 --> 2190.54]  And he faces the brutality of prison life.
[2190.90 --> 2193.82]  It is a dark situation being in a prison.
[2193.82 --> 2201.94]  but he gets in the warden's good graces and the warden ends up giving Andy a relatively cushy job
[2201.94 --> 2210.76]  in the prison library and as part of his job Andy receives and processes donations to the library
[2210.76 --> 2219.42]  mostly books but also one day along with the books someone sends a recording of Mozart's
[2219.42 --> 2225.56]  marriage of Figaro and even though Andy knows he's going to get in a lot of trouble
[2225.56 --> 2235.66]  he can just not help keep this treasure to himself and so at a strategic moment he makes this rash
[2235.66 --> 2242.68]  decision he barricades himself in the warden's office he turns on the intercom system that the
[2242.68 --> 2250.54]  warden regularly uses to frighten and actually bully the prisoners and as Andy puts on the record
[2250.54 --> 2258.60]  and he cranks up the volume everyone in the prison stops whatever it is that they are doing and this
[2258.60 --> 2270.42]  hush falls over the whole prison as these inmates listen to this beautiful music washing over the
[2270.42 --> 2278.08]  prison bringing this light and beauty into a place that is dark and so I had this idea last night I'm
[2278.08 --> 2282.20]  going to try to play it for you I didn't tell Doug ahead of time so let's see if it goes
[2282.20 --> 2299.10]  this is what comes from not planning ahead
[2299.10 --> 2301.20]  is it going to go
[2301.20 --> 2323.98]  no okay not going to go well there's the photo so you can imagine the music blasting through the
[2323.98 --> 2329.78]  intercom and you can go home and listen look it up on Spotify marriage of Figaro you can look up the
[2329.78 --> 2335.72]  Shawshank Redemption soundtrack it's beautiful and it's this opera and so there's this lady you know
[2335.72 --> 2345.90]  singing over the prison now I don't really like opera per se it's not my genre more of a kind of 90s grunge
[2345.90 --> 2355.58]  guy but it's beautiful it's beautiful music and the reason I wanted to share this story with you is
[2355.58 --> 2362.18]  that it's really quite similar to what is going on in our text this morning right with Paul and Silas
[2362.18 --> 2371.90]  they're singing in prison and then we see that the beauty of their witness and how God used them to save
[2371.90 --> 2379.08]  save the Philippian jailer so let's look at our passage this morning this is the third conversion
[2379.08 --> 2387.82]  that Luke records for us in Acts 16 and then we will consider some personal application so let's begin
[2387.82 --> 2399.50]  in verse 25 where our passage begins so verse 25 about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God
[2399.50 --> 2412.22]  now it's it's it's it's very late at night and what are Paul and Silas doing they are praying and singing hymns
[2412.22 --> 2420.38]  to God and that is really quite remarkable right when you consider what they have been through right they have
[2420.38 --> 2428.22]  been beaten with rods they likely have as we will see later in the narrative quite bad bruises and gashes
[2428.22 --> 2436.78]  there is no extra strength Tylenol or Advil all right they have been unjustly hurled into prison so
[2436.78 --> 2443.10]  there's just the shame and the anger possibly that I would feel about that because even though there are
[2443.10 --> 2450.70]  Roman citizens Paul he should have been exempt from that kind of treatment and despite all of that the
[2450.70 --> 2458.46]  the pain the injustice of it they are praying and singing hymns to God I mean if I have to like wait
[2458.46 --> 2462.94]  for the sky train for five minutes I'm like ah you know five minutes you know when I complain
[2464.46 --> 2471.26]  but for all that's happened to them they're not complaining they're not saying woe is me or anything like that
[2471.26 --> 2479.42]  they're singing this is really amazing they are trusting in God right they're trusting that God is
[2479.42 --> 2486.46]  actually sovereign over their lives he's sovereign over the circumstances in their circumstances as
[2486.46 --> 2494.94]  difficult as they are cannot take that away from them because what they know about God is that God is with
[2494.94 --> 2503.82]  them God is for them and that God rules the universe so yes things aren't working out the way they would
[2503.82 --> 2512.62]  have chose or have liked but even in the midst of their circumstances in the midst of their suffering
[2512.62 --> 2521.50]  the injustice God is good and God is for them it's the same Paul who later writes in first Thessalonians
[2521.50 --> 2531.18]  chapter 5 verse 18 he says give thanks in most circumstances right give thanks as long as
[2531.82 --> 2540.94]  you're comfortable and in control of your life right is that what it says no give thanks in all
[2540.94 --> 2546.94]  circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus what's God's will for your life
[2546.94 --> 2550.38]  give thanks in all circumstances
[2553.58 --> 2561.34]  and Paul is able to write that having actually been in jail and having been beaten and unjustly treated
[2562.22 --> 2567.10]  right he's not just you know it's not just this verse puts on the wall and even though you know maybe
[2567.10 --> 2573.50]  he hasn't actually suffered no he has suffered and he yet he writes this give thanks in all circumstances
[2573.50 --> 2582.70]  so Paul and Silas you know these two middle-aged Jewish men chained up in prison no way out seemingly
[2582.70 --> 2588.78]  hopeless situation they begin to kind of feel their way through a duet in the dark
[2590.30 --> 2599.34]  I imagine Paul maybe starting off singing bass you know then Silas kind of coming in with his tenor
[2599.34 --> 2607.82]  they're making this music perhaps it wasn't quite as beautiful as Mozart's you know aria but that
[2607.82 --> 2615.18]  notice what it says in verse 25 about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God
[2615.82 --> 2623.66]  and the other prisoners were listening to them right I bet they were right and they can sing
[2623.66 --> 2632.38]  because they know that Jesus is Lord of the whole earth every square inch belongs to him even every
[2632.38 --> 2641.90]  square inch of a jail cell in a hostile country far away from home Jesus is Lord even there so they can sing
[2643.26 --> 2648.78]  so while they are singing hymns while they're praying to God let's see what happens the prisoners are listening
[2648.78 --> 2655.18]  so we're going to be reading verse 26 about suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the
[2655.18 --> 2662.62]  foundations of the prison were shaken at once all the prison doors flew open everyone's chains came loose
[2663.74 --> 2670.46]  now this earthquake is an incredible miracle you know of course there are many earthquakes that happen
[2670.46 --> 2676.70]  around the world because of the you know general shifting of plates and when my family and I lived in Taiwan we
[2676.70 --> 2683.82]  get to experience this a bit we would feel earthquakes occasionally and the bigger ones you can actually
[2683.82 --> 2691.18]  feel the whole building shaking and kind of swaying from side to side and it's really quite alarming
[2693.42 --> 2700.78]  but we know that there is something supernatural about this because it tells us that the foundations
[2700.78 --> 2707.82]  were shaking it was a violent earthquake but the structure the prison was actually left intact and
[2707.82 --> 2712.86]  all the prison doors just popped open and all the chains fell off the walls but the walls are still there
[2713.74 --> 2719.98]  that's not normally what happens in an earthquake so this is a miracle this is God doing this so the doors
[2719.98 --> 2727.90]  are open and for the prisoners what does that mean your prison door is open for all intents and purposes it means
[2727.90 --> 2737.66]  you are free right they have the opportunity to escape this is great news but there's one person for whom
[2737.66 --> 2746.62]  this earthquake is not good news and who is that the guy in charge of guarding all the prisoners right he is
[2746.62 --> 2753.26]  responsible to make sure that these prisoners don't run away that is his job and so the jailer is suddenly
[2753.26 --> 2762.70]  having a very very bad day so let's read what happens in verse 27 how does the jailer respond the jailer woke
[2762.70 --> 2770.94]  up and when he saw the prison doors open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought
[2770.94 --> 2779.66]  the prisoners had escaped so the jailer he wakes up he sees that the prison doors are open and what do
[2779.66 --> 2788.70]  prisoners do when the good lord brings an earthquake and sets them free they run for it that's what i
[2788.70 --> 2795.66]  would have done i would have said praise the lord he answered our prayers let's go i'd be dragging silas
[2795.66 --> 2802.14]  with me i'd be grabbing everyone i can we're you know we're making an exit so of course the jailer he
[2802.14 --> 2809.50]  figures they've all escaped and i'm going to do the honorable thing which is to draw my sword and kill
[2809.50 --> 2819.82]  myself because he's going to be held responsible it was his job to guard them and if we remember back in acts 12 when the
[2819.82 --> 2827.82]  angel led um peter out of prison what happens is that the guards were actually executed by herod
[2829.66 --> 2838.86]  so this is real this is this is a crisis for this guy and what does he do he responds by thinking better to take my own life
[2839.42 --> 2845.58]  to fall on my sword than to have someone else take it and there's a real sense of hopelessness
[2846.62 --> 2854.62]  for the jailer you know suddenly the tables are turned paul and silas are now free and it's the jailer
[2854.62 --> 2862.22]  who is really not free but he is in a very bad situation and he needs to be saved
[2862.22 --> 2875.58]  but he hears a reassuring voice doesn't he the voice of paul and what does paul say in verse 28 but paul
[2875.58 --> 2884.54]  shouted don't harm yourself we are all here right think about that think about paul what he must be
[2884.54 --> 2893.34]  thinking at that moment god has delivered them maybe he was praying psalm 142 lord free me from my prison
[2894.94 --> 2902.14]  and god's answered his prayers he's free he can go back and keep preaching that's surely what god would
[2902.14 --> 2912.46]  have him do but paul notices this man and he notices his need and so he cries out he says hey don't harm
[2912.46 --> 2915.02]  yourself we are all here
[2915.02 --> 2922.14]  and it seems as though paul realizes that the earthquake wasn't as much to free him
[2923.18 --> 2932.62]  so much as it was for him to free the jailer right to save him so verse 29 what happens the jailer
[2932.62 --> 2940.38]  father called for lights he rushed in and he fell trembling before paul and silas he then brought them
[2940.38 --> 2949.58]  out and asked sirs what must i do to be saved what must i do to be saved now why would he ask that question
[2951.50 --> 2958.22]  all right he's a gentile he's a roman soldier he probably he's fought in many battles he's probably
[2958.22 --> 2964.62]  nearing retirement age and this is kind of a job that many soldiers who maybe aren't quite fit for
[2964.62 --> 2970.70]  the front lines they would go and work in like a jail like this he doesn't know the god of the bible
[2971.74 --> 2977.42]  he doesn't understand the how the old testament talks about sin and the need for redemption
[2978.22 --> 2984.38]  why does he ask this question and some commentators have said well you know surely he wouldn't know what
[2984.38 --> 2991.42]  it means to be saved so what it means is what must i do to be safe right in other words he's pleading
[2991.42 --> 2997.58]  for paul and silas just to help him get out of this situation so he wouldn't get in trouble but i i
[2997.58 --> 3004.46]  don't think that is what's going on right because they didn't run away already right all the prisoners
[3004.46 --> 3009.82]  are still there he can't be in trouble for the prisoners escaping if they didn't escape
[3009.82 --> 3017.26]  and paul's already saved his life in a physical sense when he said don't kill yourself we're all
[3017.26 --> 3023.74]  here so the you know the jailer he's not in any kind of physical danger he's not really in trouble
[3023.74 --> 3030.62]  at this point so when he asks sirs what must i do to be saved i think he means the way that we take it
[3030.62 --> 3038.78]  which is in a spiritual sense because remember he has heard perhaps for the last hour or two or three
[3039.90 --> 3050.06]  paul and silas worshiping god praying to god singing about this god who saves and who delivers his people
[3051.74 --> 3059.10]  he's listening to all this undoubtedly also he's heard the news going around town about this
[3059.10 --> 3064.94]  fortune-telling girl who and what she has been saying about them these men are servants of the
[3064.94 --> 3072.62]  most high god who are telling you the way to be saved he's heard this and he's probably thinking
[3072.62 --> 3081.26]  as many would in those days that earthquakes were acts of the gods and so he recognizes that their god
[3081.26 --> 3088.94]  sent an earthquake to save them clearly he their god sent this their god is the true god
[3089.66 --> 3096.38]  and so he asked what must i do to be saved i see your god is powerful he is the true god
[3097.18 --> 3104.94]  he can save you how can he save me right what what do i have to do to know this god to be in the good
[3104.94 --> 3114.78]  graces of this god how how can your god become my god what must i do and here is the answer it's
[3114.78 --> 3123.34]  beautiful for no other reason than its simplicity verse 31 believe in the lord jesus and you will be
[3123.34 --> 3125.26]  saved you and your household
[3125.26 --> 3136.38]  what must i do to be saved believe in jesus that's it this is what we you know our kids can say
[3136.38 --> 3144.22]  what how do you be saved believe in jesus right it's so simple so beautiful right cast your confidence
[3144.22 --> 3151.66]  in the lord jesus trust in him let him be your god and he will save you you belong to him
[3151.66 --> 3159.10]  this is what paul shares and so the jailer embraces that he embraces it he embraces jesus
[3159.66 --> 3163.98]  and he gets baptized so notice what happens in verse 33
[3163.98 --> 3176.46]  is it there verse 33 yeah okay uh maybe okay 34 the oh there it is we found it
[3176.46 --> 3184.70]  that at that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds then immediately he and
[3184.70 --> 3192.54]  all of his household were baptized and i want you to notice something very poetic going on the jailer
[3192.54 --> 3200.54]  takes paul and silas who remember had been beaten and bloody and he washes them and then what happens
[3200.54 --> 3209.82]  then paul washes him right he was baptized and baptism is a washing away so the jailer is washing
[3209.82 --> 3217.42]  paul and silas his wounds because there is blood on them and then they wash him with christ's blood upon
[3217.42 --> 3223.34]  him it's a very beautiful picture and then look with me at verse 34
[3225.66 --> 3229.26]  the jailer brought them into his house and he said a meal before them
[3229.26 --> 3234.06]  he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in god he and his whole household
[3235.50 --> 3242.14]  and what we find is that his conversion bears fruit right his life is already being transformed
[3242.14 --> 3248.78]  right and just as with lydia the philippian jailer he recognizes that after receiving the grace and mercy
[3248.78 --> 3256.78]  of god all he can do now is give and give and give and he welcomes them into his house and he
[3256.78 --> 3265.26]  feeds them and they rejoice together so there it is right that that's the third conversion that luke
[3265.26 --> 3275.50]  writes about for us that of the philippian jailer god had quietly opened lydia's heart god has sent his holy
[3275.50 --> 3283.98]  spirit to drive out a demonic spirit to drive out of a girl then now god causes an earthquake to save
[3284.54 --> 3293.42]  a jailer three very different people three very different ways of god interacting with the world
[3294.30 --> 3299.18]  encountering people where they are in their lives and bringing them to salvation
[3299.18 --> 3305.42]  you know it's interesting to think though about why luke chose these three conversion stories
[3306.22 --> 3313.74]  i mean he probably could have written about a number of others who came to faith why did he choose these
[3313.74 --> 3324.46]  three well what makes these three so remarkable is this that paul who is a former rabbi a former pharisee
[3324.46 --> 3330.70]  who would have said every morning along with every other jewish male he would have prayed this prayer
[3331.58 --> 3338.94]  he would have said thank you god that i am not a gentile that i am not a slave and that i am not a woman
[3340.22 --> 3345.50]  that's what they would have prayed and yet in verse 40 look at what luke writes
[3347.18 --> 3352.86]  after paul and silas came out of prison they went to lydia's house where they met with the brothers and
[3352.86 --> 3364.14]  sisters and encouraged them then they left who were these brothers and sisters a woman a slave and a gentile
[3367.18 --> 3376.54]  it's interesting to think of the philippian jailer and in his household and lydia and her household and
[3376.54 --> 3383.98]  this girl and who knows who else all gathered together now as part of god's people worshiping
[3383.98 --> 3390.78]  the lord together right that is the foundation of the church in philippi and luke is actually telling
[3390.78 --> 3398.62]  us that the gospel gathers people from every social strata every culture in every part of the world and he
[3398.62 --> 3406.94]  knits them together as family it's very beautiful well i just want to now as we come to a conclusion
[3407.66 --> 3415.26]  give us two kind of things to consider by way of application two things to consider the first is this
[3415.26 --> 3420.54]  you know as we've kind of gone with we've looked at lydia and the slave girl we've been asking how does god
[3420.54 --> 3426.78]  accomplish this how does god accomplish their salvation and so how does he save the jailer
[3427.66 --> 3434.78]  because on the one hand again we can say god did it what did god do in this story god sent an earthquake
[3435.82 --> 3442.38]  god opened the prison doors god caused the jailer to believe in christ for salvation
[3443.58 --> 3451.10]  but again notice god doesn't do it apart from us and so in the case of the jailer god saved him
[3451.66 --> 3459.90]  through the exemplary witness and in character of paul and silas all right when god placed paul and silas in
[3459.90 --> 3465.82]  that prison and note this god allowed them to be beaten
[3469.02 --> 3477.26]  he allowed them to be treated unjustly right does god allow bad things to happen to those
[3478.14 --> 3480.54]  whom he loves the answer is yes
[3483.98 --> 3487.02]  he allowed them to be in that prison he wanted them in that prison
[3487.90 --> 3495.26]  to save a jailer and so what did this jailer see in paul and silas he saw two men who at the very risk
[3495.26 --> 3503.02]  of their own lives stayed when the prison doors were opened in order to save him right he saw god's
[3503.02 --> 3510.38]  love for him through the love of paul and silas through their care and concern for him when he
[3510.38 --> 3520.06]  didn't deserve it i love how the fourth century preacher chrysostrum writes this or how he puts it he says this
[3523.18 --> 3523.82]  he says
[3523.82 --> 3525.98]  he says
[3526.54 --> 3533.74]  doug said he was gonna give me a clicker but there he is they only showed him the doors opened
[3534.46 --> 3542.38]  and it opened the doors of his heart right beautiful paul and silas they only showed the jailer the
[3542.38 --> 3549.74]  doors opened and it opened the doors of his heart right god opened the heart of the jailer through
[3549.74 --> 3557.34]  the witness of paul and silas who put his knees and his life above their own
[3559.18 --> 3569.18]  and so do you think paul regretted those stripes on his back those beatings when he was being washed by
[3569.18 --> 3579.02]  that jailer and as he baptized that jailer i don't think so but why not why would paul and silas be
[3579.02 --> 3585.58]  so willing to suffer unjustly for this man's salvation why would they be willing to do this what kind of
[3585.58 --> 3594.94]  people are these well it must be because that's what the lord jesus did for them right jesus was innocent
[3594.94 --> 3603.18]  he was then dragged before the magistrates he was unjustly condemned he was beaten
[3604.70 --> 3611.82]  and as the prophet isaiah says by his wounds we are healed right jesus suffered and died
[3613.26 --> 3620.62]  for our salvation for us and when we see that jesus did that for us it makes us willing
[3620.62 --> 3626.14]  than to suffer any sort of difficult circumstance to bring about the salvation of someone else
[3627.58 --> 3632.86]  and so with the conversion of the jailer we see god's god working through the witness of his people
[3634.14 --> 3641.98]  and god friends he might very well use your witness your trust in god in a difficult circumstance that
[3641.98 --> 3649.26]  maybe you're going through in order for other people to see your trust in god
[3649.26 --> 3652.14]  and for you to then be able to witness to them
[3654.94 --> 3659.18]  so that's the first thing and the second thing i want to mention by way of application is just how
[3659.18 --> 3665.98]  important rejoicing is in the christian life right again these two men are praying and singing in the
[3665.98 --> 3672.06]  middle of the night now prayer that makes sense if you're in prison what are you going to be doing
[3672.06 --> 3680.14]  you don't have your phones okay what are you going to be doing praying right that makes sense you can
[3680.14 --> 3686.30]  understand that they're going to pray in prison but singing hymns right how can you explain that
[3687.42 --> 3694.78]  singing hymns to god you know in the movie the shawshank redemption as that music was was playing over the
[3694.78 --> 3700.94]  loudspeakers and as the prisoners are all standing there in rapture at the beauty that is suddenly flooding
[3700.94 --> 3708.86]  into their world this is what the narrator says in the movie it says this it was like some beautiful
[3708.86 --> 3718.06]  bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away and for the briefest of moments
[3719.02 --> 3723.74]  every last man in shawshank felt free
[3723.74 --> 3731.50]  right this is this beautiful music made them feel not confined by this prison but but free
[3732.46 --> 3737.02]  soaring like a bird and they felt free when they heard this music
[3737.90 --> 3744.22]  now what does that mean then or what does that say about paul and silas who are not just hearing that music
[3744.94 --> 3748.62]  but they were they were the ones making it they were the ones singing
[3748.62 --> 3755.74]  in that jail and what it must mean is that despite their chains they were absolutely free
[3756.94 --> 3764.38]  they they were free even before the earthquake came that opened the doors of the prison they had
[3764.38 --> 3771.50]  always been free and that's why even in a prison cell you can be the freest person in the entire world
[3771.50 --> 3778.30]  world and conversely you can kind of look like you're free but actually not be
[3780.62 --> 3785.82]  but they can you can be free we can be free we can rejoice in this christian life despite our
[3785.82 --> 3790.54]  difficulties despite whatever circumstances that we are facing we can have the freedom
[3791.26 --> 3799.58]  to sing hymns to god because the grace of god it it enables us to see not by sight but by faith
[3799.58 --> 3807.10]  and the grace of god enables us kind of as we say to lift up our eyes to him the one who is in heaven
[3808.54 --> 3814.30]  and the grace of god enables us to see that god is in control and he will make all things well and he
[3814.30 --> 3817.82]  does all things well so let's pray together
[3817.82 --> 3828.06]  father father you do all things well lord you make all things well
[3830.38 --> 3835.26]  and we thank you for paul and silas for their witness to us these many years later
[3836.78 --> 3844.22]  but lord we thank you most of all for our savior's witness to us that he suffered for us he bled and died
[3844.22 --> 3853.18]  so that we could be washed that we could be forgiven that we could be truly free no matter what
[3853.18 --> 3862.06]  our circumstances and so we praise you and we thank you for our salvation that we have received because
[3862.06 --> 3866.86]  we have fallen before you and said what must we do and you said
[3866.86 --> 3875.58]  we have done it for us we have done it for you in jesus just receive it's a gift
[3877.34 --> 3886.46]  so lord help us then in response to serve and witness to others for jesus sake we pray amen
[3886.46 --> 3895.18]  so for our song of response we're going to be singing a song oh god beyond all praising
[3896.54 --> 3904.62]  and um i think this ties in well to our scripture passage so i just want to read a couple of one
[3904.62 --> 3910.62]  stanza i think verse three did i oh i didn't put did i put it i did okay there it is so let's just you
[3910.62 --> 3916.38]  know meditate on the words that we're about to sing then hear oh gracious savior accept the love
[3916.38 --> 3924.38]  we bring that we who know your favor may serve you as our king and whether our tomorrows be filled
[3924.38 --> 3933.26]  with good or ill will triumph triumph through our sorrows and rise to bless you still so let's rise
[3933.26 --> 3943.26]  let's rise and let's sing
[3943.26 --> 3947.26]  so
[3947.26 --> 3957.26]  so
[3957.26 --> 3961.26]  so

[4139.26 --> 4145.26]  giving
[4145.26 --> 4147.26]  so
[4147.26 --> 4151.26]  so we'll continue to worship the lord by giving part of what he has given to us and he
[4151.26 --> 4153.26]  he
[4153.26 --> 4159.26]  graciously gives us all things and so our designated offering for today is edudeo and

[4305.26 --> 4307.26]  some of our needs in our congregation
[4307.26 --> 4309.26]  so let's pray together
[4313.26 --> 4315.26]  merciful God
[4315.26 --> 4321.26]  we confess that when we see the violence in our world
[4321.26 --> 4325.26]  in so many heartbreaking circumstances
[4325.26 --> 4327.26]  whether it is in
[4327.26 --> 4329.26]  whether it is in
[4329.26 --> 4331.26]  Israel or Gaza
[4331.26 --> 4333.26]  Russia
[4333.26 --> 4335.26]  in Ukraine or in the Sudan
[4335.26 --> 4337.26]  many other places in our world
[4337.26 --> 4341.26]  Lord so often we do not know what to do or even what to say
[4341.26 --> 4347.26]  so Lord we thank you for the simple prayer of Lord have mercy
[4347.26 --> 4353.26]  and so we pray
[4353.26 --> 4355.26]  Lord have mercy
[4355.26 --> 4357.26]  especially Lord we pray for the peace of Jerusalem
[4357.26 --> 4359.26]  and for the peace in Israel
[4361.26 --> 4363.26]  in the Gaza Strip
[4363.26 --> 4365.26]  the West Bank
[4365.26 --> 4367.26]  and by extension the entire Middle East
[4367.26 --> 4371.26]  we know that sin entered the world through one man
[4371.26 --> 4375.26]  and along with it enmity and strife and violence
[4375.26 --> 4377.26]  destruction of peace amongst peoples
[4377.26 --> 4379.26]  amongst nations
[4379.26 --> 4381.26]  but we know that through the cross
[4381.26 --> 4383.26]  that people everywhere
[4383.26 --> 4385.26]  can be reconciled to you
[4385.26 --> 4389.26]  and restored in relationship to each other
[4389.26 --> 4393.26]  and so we pray that even in these days of violence and war
[4393.26 --> 4395.26]  that your church
[4395.26 --> 4399.26]  would be reaching Jews and Palestinians
[4399.26 --> 4401.26]  and indeed people everywhere
[4401.26 --> 4405.26]  with the gospel message of truth and reconciliation
[4405.26 --> 4407.26]  would you stop
[4407.26 --> 4411.26]  would you prevent anything that is wrong in your sight
[4411.26 --> 4415.26]  Father would you comfort those who mourn
[4415.26 --> 4417.26]  and are heartbroken
[4417.26 --> 4419.26]  would you give wisdom to governments
[4419.26 --> 4421.26]  and those in leadership
[4421.26 --> 4423.26]  in Israel and in other lands
[4423.26 --> 4425.26]  in Israel and in other lands
[4427.26 --> 4429.26]  and would your law
[4429.26 --> 4431.26]  be written upon their hearts
[4433.26 --> 4435.26]  that there would be a restoring of peace
[4435.26 --> 4437.26]  in the Middle East
[4437.26 --> 4439.26]  such that your mercy and love
[4439.26 --> 4441.26]  your invitation of peace
[4441.26 --> 4443.26]  would be extended to all
[4443.26 --> 4445.26]  all before the time comes
[4445.26 --> 4449.26]  when you will indeed come to judge all the earth
[4451.26 --> 4455.26]  and Lord as we also turn our eyes
[4455.26 --> 4457.26]  to our own circumstances
[4457.26 --> 4459.26]  in our own congregation
[4459.26 --> 4461.26]  Lord there's also
[4461.26 --> 4464.26]  some things that we want to bring before you

[4480.26 --> 4481.26]  his caretakers
[4481.26 --> 4483.26]  would you sustain them

[4485.26 --> 4487.26]  and grace and patience and love
[4487.26 --> 4489.26]  that we need
