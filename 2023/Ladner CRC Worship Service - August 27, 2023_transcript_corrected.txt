[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[300.00 → 302.00] Amen.
[330.00 → 334.00] Good morning.
[335.00 → 336.00] Good morning.
[336.00 → 340.00] Welcome to our worship service at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[340.00 → 343.00] We're happy that you could be with us this morning.
[343.00 → 347.00] There's not nearly as many people as there were here a Sunday or two ago.
[347.00 → 351.00] With the Banter family.
[354.00 → 358.00] Anyway, we're happy that you could be with us whether in person or on YouTube.
[358.00 → 363.00] And if you're a visitor this morning, we're especially pleased that you are worshipping with us.
[363.00 → 368.00] And we ask that you join with us for refreshments after the service in the fellowship hall.
[369.00 → 373.00] I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader for part of the service.
[373.00 → 378.00] And we're privileged this morning to have Pastor Len Battering with us again.
[378.00 → 381.00] And welcome him to our service.
[381.00 → 388.00] As he mentioned last week, he preached God's word to us at Ladder many times before he was
[388.00 → 390.00] for Pastor Jason Kane.
[390.00 → 393.00] And we were blessed by hearing his messages then.
[393.00 → 398.00] And we look forward to hearing his message today on the faith of the foreign woman.
[398.00 → 402.00] I have a couple of announcements to make.
[402.00 → 405.00] And one is in your bulletin, but I'll repeat it up here.
[405.00 → 407.00] It's from the deacons.
[407.00 → 417.00] Next Thursday, September 3, there will be a special offering for you to donate to the Canadian Red Cross BC Fire Relief Fund.
[417.00 → 419.00] Quite a long title.
[419.00 → 426.00] Please place your donations in an offering envelope and mark the envelope Red Cross Fire Relief.
[426.00 → 439.00] For this special offering, any cash collected that is not in an offering envelope will automatically be included in the Canadian Red Cross BC Fire Relief offering.
[439.00 → 446.00] And if you're not here on that date, you can bring your offering envelope to church during the week.
[446.00 → 454.00] The September 3 scheduled offering for Delta Christian School will be collected as usual in your offering envelope.
[454.00 → 462.00] You can also donate to the Canadian Red Cross on your own at their website that's listed in the bulletin.
[462.00 → 463.00] Okay.
[463.00 → 472.00] And also, another announcement, tomorrow, August 28, is Ted Vander horst's 98th birthday.
[472.00 → 477.00] But sadly, he'll be celebrating it in the hospital.
[477.00 → 483.00] As you may have read in the bulletin, he had a fall earlier this week and is still under the doctor's care.
[483.00 → 488.00] But we give praise to God for all the years Ted has been given.
[488.00 → 501.00] Our call to worship this morning is based on Psalm 8.
[501.00 → 513.00] Gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, inspired by the Holy Spirit and blessed by God, we come to worship one holy God.
[513.00 → 520.00] Our, O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[520.00 → 530.00] Our majesty is the music of the starry skies, yet even the children of dust can sing your praises.
[530.00 → 538.00] In the name of the healer, the provider, and the enabler, let your gratitude and joy be made known.
[538.00 → 545.00] O God, our own God, how wonderful is your name in all the earth.
[545.00 → 549.00] Let's come before the Lord with a prayer of adoration.
[549.00 → 556.00] O God, our mighty forever.
[556.00 → 559.00] You cause the wind to blow, and the rain to fall.
[559.00 → 567.00] You sustain the living, give life to the dead, support the falling, and loose those who are bound.
[567.00 → 570.00] Who is like you, O God of mighty acts?
[570.00 → 572.00] Praise be to you forever.
[572.00 → 574.00] Amen.
[574.00 → 582.94] please rise for the Lord's greeting if you're able and the Lord greets you this
[582.94 → 591.10] morning with these words from Zephaniah 3 verse 17 the Lord your God is with you
[591.10 → 599.68] the mighty warrior who saves he will take great delight in you in his love he
[599.68 → 607.60] will no longer rebuke you but will rejoice over you with singing as God has
[607.60 → 611.92] greeted us so let us greet each other
[629.68 → 632.74] thank you
[634.60 → 634.82] yes
[634.82 → 664.80] Come.
[664.82 → 670.42] Now is the time to worship.
[672.36 → 672.80] Come.
[674.12 → 680.54] Now is the time to give your heart.
[681.08 → 682.26] Come.
[682.90 → 687.32] Just as you are to worship.
[687.32 → 689.32] Come.
[691.22 → 696.62] Just as you are before your God.
[697.96 → 698.40] Come.
[698.40 → 699.40] Come.
[701.40 → 706.12] One day every tongue will confess you are God.
[706.48 → 709.62] One day every knee will bow.
[711.10 → 718.96] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[718.96 → 719.96] Come.
[721.96 → 723.28] Come.
[724.84 → 729.64] Now is the time to worship.
[731.38 → 732.34] Come.

[739.96 → 740.96] Come.
[740.96 → 741.96] Come.
[741.96 → 747.56] Just as you are to worship.
[749.56 → 749.96] Come.
[750.96 → 756.96] Just as you are before your God.
[757.96 → 758.96] Come.
[758.96 → 759.96] Come.
[759.96 → 760.96] Come.
[760.96 → 761.96] Come.
[761.96 → 763.96] Now is the time to worship.
[763.96 → 764.96] Come.
[764.96 → 765.96] Come.
[765.96 → 766.96] Come.
[766.96 → 767.96] Come.
[767.96 → 768.96] Come.
[768.96 → 774.96] Now is the time to give your heart.
[774.96 → 775.96] Come.
[775.96 → 776.96] Come.
[776.96 → 777.96] Come.
[777.96 → 781.96] Now is the time to worship.
[781.96 → 782.96] Come.
[782.96 → 783.96] Come.
[783.96 → 784.96] Come.
[784.96 → 789.96] Now is the time to worship.
[789.96 → 790.96] Come.
[790.96 → 795.96] Now is the time to give your heart.
[795.96 → 796.96] Come.
[796.96 → 799.96] Now is the time to give your heart.
[799.96 → 800.96] Come.
[800.96 → 805.96] Just as you are to worship.
[805.96 → 806.96] Come.
[806.96 → 807.96] Come.
[807.96 → 808.96] Come.
[808.96 → 809.96] Come.
[809.96 → 810.96] Come.
[810.96 → 811.96] Come.
[811.96 → 816.96] Just as you are before your God.
[818.96 → 820.96] Come.
[838.96 → 852.74] Let us build a house where love can dwell and all can safely live.
[852.74 → 862.74] A place where saints and children tell how our hearts turn to forgive.
[862.74 → 874.74] Built of hopes and dreams and visions, rock of faith and vaults of grace.
[874.74 → 881.74] Hear the love of Christ's shell and divisions.
[881.74 → 896.74] All are welcome, all are welcome, all are welcome in this place.
[896.74 → 908.88] Let us build a house where love is found, in water, wine, and wheat.
[909.48 → 920.20] A banquet hall on holy ground, where peace and justice meet.
[920.20 → 926.20] Hear the love of God through Jesus.
[926.20 → 932.20] His re-filled in time and space.
[932.20 → 938.20] As we share in Christ our fears that frees us.
[938.20 → 953.20] All are welcome, all are welcome, all are welcome in this place.
[953.20 → 966.20] Let us build a house where hands will reach beyond the wood and stone.
[966.20 → 978.20] To heal and strengthen, serve and teach, and live the world they've known.
[978.20 → 983.20] Here the love of God's love, stranger.
[983.20 → 989.20] There the image of God's face.
[989.20 → 995.20] Let us bring an end to fear and danger.
[995.20 → 1010.20] All are welcome, all are welcome, all are welcome, all are welcome in this place.
[1010.20 → 1023.20] Let us build a house where all our name, there's salt and fish and spirit.
[1023.20 → 1036.20] And love is true, she's taught and claimed, as we're within the world.
[1036.20 → 1048.20] And love is true, she's taught and claimed, as we're within the world.
[1048.20 → 1059.20] Built of tears and cries and laughter, prayers of faith and songs of grace.
[1059.20 → 1060.20] Let us build a house where all our name is.
[1060.20 → 1084.20] Let us build a home, all are welcome, all are welcome, all are welcome in this place.
[1084.20 → 1091.20] Please be seated.
[1091.20 → 1094.20] Children of the Heavenly Father.
[1094.20 → 1100.20] Lena Sin del, the author of this hymn, was the Lutheran pastor's daughter in Sweden.
[1100.20 → 1104.20] She was a daddy's girl, very close to her father.
[1104.20 → 1111.20] As a child, she enjoyed playing quietly in her father's study as he worked.
[1111.20 → 1114.20] Lena began writing hymns at a very early age.
[1114.20 → 1119.20] Then, when she was 26 years old, tragedy struck.
[1119.20 → 1124.20] She and her fathers were passengers in a boat cruising late lantern,
[1124.20 → 1128.20] when the boat lurched and her father fell overboard.
[1128.20 → 1135.20] As Lena watched in horror, her father drowned before anyone could mount a rescue effort.
[1135.20 → 1140.20] When tragedy strikes, some people allow it to destroy them.
[1140.20 → 1144.20] But Lena's faith saw her through the tragedy.
[1144.20 → 1149.20] Her grief gave her music a new depth and sensitivity.
[1149.20 → 1155.20] The hymn, Children of the Heavenly Father, offers a kind of quiet assurance.
[1155.20 → 1158.20] It speaks of resting safely in the father's bosom,
[1158.20 → 1162.20] of the father tending and nourishing his children and protecting them.
[1162.20 → 1167.20] For us today, we will learn about Jesus as he heals a Canaanite woman's daughter,
[1167.20 → 1170.20] also showing that the grace of God is available for everyone.
[1170.20 → 1174.20] Indeed, everyone in the world, no matter their nationality or status.
[1174.20 → 1180.20] God is inviting everyone to become his child, become a child of their Heavenly Father.
[1180.20 → 1206.20] God is inviting everyone to become a child, become a child of their Father.
[1206.20 → 1212.20] Children of the Heavenly Father,
[1212.20 → 1218.20] safely in his bosom gather,
[1218.20 → 1224.20] Nesting with no star in heaven,
[1224.20 → 1231.20] Such a refuge there was given.
[1231.20 → 1237.20] God is known, shall tend and nourish,
[1237.20 → 1243.20] In his holy courts they flourish,
[1243.20 → 1249.20] From all evil things he spares them,
[1249.20 → 1256.20] In his mighty arms he bears them.
[1256.20 → 1263.20] Neither life nor death shall ever,
[1263.20 → 1269.20] From the Lord his children sever,
[1269.20 → 1274.20] For to them his grace revealing,
[1274.20 → 1281.20] He turns sorrow into healing.
[1281.20 → 1286.20] God has given,
[1286.20 → 1289.20] He has taken,
[1289.20 → 1291.20] But his children,
[1291.20 → 1294.20] Ere forsaken,
[1294.20 → 1300.20] Is the loving purpose holy,
[1300.20 → 1303.20] To preserve them,
[1303.20 → 1308.20] Pure and holy.
[1308.20 → 1326.20] For our time of confession,
[1326.20 → 1331.20] Let's confess our sin before God and one another with these words.
[1331.20 → 1339.20] O God our guide,
[1339.20 → 1343.20] Who once used a star to lead people to Christ,
[1343.20 → 1347.20] We confess our poor sense of direction.
[1347.20 → 1354.20] We let ourselves become confused, easily distracted, and lose our way.
[1354.20 → 1360.20] We fail to follow the signs you provide.
[1360.20 → 1363.20] Forgive our waywardness, O God.
[1363.20 → 1366.20] Lead us to Christ,
[1366.20 → 1369.20] So that we may follow his way to you.
[1369.20 → 1373.20] Amen.
[1373.20 → 1375.20] And God's assurance of pardon,
[1375.20 → 1377.20] And forgiveness of our sin,
[1377.20 → 1382.20] Is from John 1, verses 9 and 12.
[1382.20 → 1386.20] The true light that gives light to everyone,
[1386.20 → 1388.20] Was coming into the world.
[1388.20 → 1391.20] Yet to all who did receive him,
[1391.20 → 1394.20] To those who believed in his name,
[1394.20 → 1399.20] He gave the right to become children of God.
[1399.20 → 1413.20] There's a whiteness in God's mercy,
[1413.20 → 1418.20] Like the whiteness of the sea.
[1418.20 → 1423.20] There is kindness in God's justice,
[1423.20 → 1428.20] Which is more than liberty.
[1428.20 → 1433.20] There is kindness in God's justice,
[1433.20 → 1435.20] Which is more than liberty.
[1435.20 → 1438.20] There is kindness in God's justice,
[1438.20 → 1440.20] There is no place where our souls
[1440.20 → 1454.20] Are more fell than up in heaven.
[1454.20 → 1459.20] There is no place where ours innings
[1459.20 → 1467.20] Have such kindly judgment give.
[1467.20 → 1472.20] For the love of God is broader
[1472.20 → 1478.20] Than the measures of the mind,
[1478.20 → 1484.20] Than the heart of the eternal
[1484.20 → 1489.20] Is most wonderful, behold.
[1489.20 → 1495.20] Make our love of God more faithful,
[1495.20 → 1500.20] Let us stand with you at your way,
[1500.20 → 1506.20] And our lives will be things daily,
[1506.20 → 1514.20] For the goodness of the Lord.
[1514.20 → 1515.20] Amen.
[1515.20 → 1516.20] Amen.
[1516.20 → 1517.20] Amen.
[1517.20 → 1518.20] Amen.
[1518.20 → 1519.20] Amen.
[1519.20 → 1520.20] Amen.
[1520.20 → 1521.20] Amen.
[1521.20 → 1522.20] Amen.
[1522.20 → 1523.20] Amen.
[1523.20 → 1524.20] Amen.
[1525.20 → 1526.20] Amen.
[1526.20 → 1527.20] Amen.
[1531.20 → 1532.20] Amen.
[1532.20 → 1535.20] At this time, the Sunday school children,
[1535.20 → 1544.26] At this time, the Sunday school children, ages three to grade one, are welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School.
[1548.14 → 1550.50] And we welcome Pastor Battering.
[1551.54 → 1552.78] Thank you.
[1561.78 → 1563.02] Good morning.
[1563.02 → 1565.02] Good morning.
[1565.02 → 1566.02] Good morning.
[1566.02 → 1568.02] Again, a delight to be with you.
[1568.02 → 1573.02] We're going to be reading a little piece from the Gospel of Matthew this morning.
[1573.02 → 1578.02] And it's about the faith of a Canaanite woman.
[1578.02 → 1585.02] Jesus and his disciples are in a region called the region of Tyre and Simon.
[1585.02 → 1590.02] And if you ever see those maps of the Holy Land, Tyre and Simon were on the coast.
[1590.02 → 1600.02] And one of the remarkable things I've sort of come to discover through the Bible is some of these places are ancient.
[1600.02 → 1606.02] You know, here in North America, and especially in the western side, everything is really recent.
[1606.02 → 1609.02] You know, there were indigenous people for many, many years.
[1609.02 → 1614.02] But, you know, the cities that we know are all put up in the last generation or two.
[1614.02 → 1619.02] Simon was 2,000 years old when Jesus walked on the street.
[1619.02 → 1621.02] So this is a very old place.
[1621.02 → 1633.02] And there were people living in that land well before, you know, Joshua led the people over the Jordan and into the promised land, into the time of conquest.
[1633.02 → 1640.02] And so this was one of the people who had always been there in the land, the people of the land, as they were called.
[1640.02 → 1645.02] And anyway, she comes to Jesus and this is her story.
[1645.02 → 1650.02] Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Simon.
[1650.02 → 1655.02] A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out,
[1655.02 → 1659.02] Lord, son of David, have mercy on me.
[1659.02 → 1662.02] My daughter is demon possessed and suffering terribly.
[1662.02 → 1666.02] Jesus did not answer a word.
[1666.02 → 1669.02] So his disciples came to him and urged him,
[1669.02 → 1674.02] Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.
[1674.02 → 1680.02] And he answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.
[1680.02 → 1684.02] The woman came down and knelt before him, Lord, help me, she said.
[1684.02 → 1690.02] And he replied, It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.
[1690.02 → 1693.02] Yes, it is, Lord, she said.
[1693.02 → 1697.02] Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.
[1697.02 → 1700.02] And then Jesus said to her,
[1700.02 → 1703.02] Woman, you have great faith.
[1703.02 → 1705.02] Your request is granted.
[1705.02 → 1710.02] And her daughter was healed at that moment.
[1710.02 → 1711.02] The word of the Lord.
[1711.02 → 1713.02] Thanks be to God.
[1713.02 → 1723.02] Do you know the word patriarchy?
[1723.02 → 1725.02] I would assume you do.
[1725.02 → 1730.02] Depending on who you know and where you work,
[1730.02 → 1736.02] you will hear that word an awful lot or not very much at all.
[1736.02 → 1743.02] Patriarchy is one of those long English words that build from a couple of short Greek words.
[1743.02 → 1746.02] So the first one is patter or father.
[1746.02 → 1750.02] And then the second arch, which is power or control.
[1750.02 → 1756.02] So patriarchy means that father is in charge.
[1756.02 → 1759.02] Father makes all the big decisions.
[1759.02 → 1762.02] Father controls the money.
[1762.02 → 1768.02] And nowadays in a more general sense, it means that men are in charge.
[1768.02 → 1770.02] That men make all the big decisions.
[1770.02 → 1774.02] And that men are in charge of the money.
[1774.02 → 1780.02] I checked the big Oxford Dictionary and here's the definition.
[1780.02 → 1790.02] It is a social system in which positions of dominance and privilege are held primarily by men.
[1790.02 → 1793.02] Now, is patriarchy dead?
[1793.02 → 1795.02] Or is it still here?
[1795.02 → 1801.02] Well, it depends on who you know and who you ask.
[1801.02 → 1808.02] You might hear people say that, you know, women have made enormous strides in the last hundred years or so.
[1808.02 → 1810.02] I mean, they can now vote.
[1810.02 → 1812.02] Women can serve in government.
[1812.02 → 1814.02] They can sit on corporate boards.
[1814.02 → 1816.02] They can join the military.
[1816.02 → 1820.02] They can even fly in space.
[1820.02 → 1827.02] Or you may hear from others that patriarchy is still everywhere.
[1827.02 → 1833.02] Because those gains we supposedly saw over the last hundred years, they are superficial.
[1833.02 → 1836.02] It's mostly for show.
[1836.02 → 1840.02] Yes, we know women are in politics and in business and on TV.
[1840.02 → 1845.02] But, you know, it's still the men who control things.
[1845.02 → 1847.02] They are in charge of the money.
[1847.02 → 1849.02] They make the big decisions.
[1849.02 → 1860.02] Or, you may hear from still others that patriarchy is going away, but it's not totally gone yet.
[1860.02 → 1864.02] In other words, the glass is sort of half empty and half full.
[1864.02 → 1875.02] And, well, then you've got to kind of make up your mind whether you're going to be happy about the progress that's been made or angry because progress is so slow.
[1875.02 → 1879.02] And now this.
[1879.02 → 1886.02] Depending on who you ask, patriarchy is all over the Bible.
[1886.02 → 1890.02] I mean, there were twelve tribes in Israel, all named after men.
[1890.02 → 1894.02] All those Old Testament prophets were all men.
[1894.02 → 1898.02] And the disciples, twelve of them, all men.
[1898.02 → 1902.02] And women, well, they were supposed to know their place and be quiet.
[1902.02 → 1917.02] Or, you may hear from others that actually, while, you know, the Bible has a lot of old stuff in it, it honours women, and it sets women and all people free from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
[1917.02 → 1920.02] I've once heard it called, it was a liberating text.
[1920.02 → 1923.02] Sound right?
[1923.02 → 1926.02] Sound right?
[1926.02 → 1929.02] Well, on this one, the Bible is kind of mixed.
[1929.02 → 1933.02] Yes, it has patriarchy in it.
[1933.02 → 1942.02] It is a book that's 2,000 years old, and it reflects a world that's, you know, deep in the past when, yes, men were mostly in charge.
[1942.02 → 1949.02] But that does not mean that it puts women second and tells them to know their place and be quiet.
[1949.02 → 1961.02] I mean, the apostle Paul once said that in Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, there's neither slave nor free, there's neither male nor female, for all are one in Christ.
[1961.02 → 1976.02] All of God's children, men and women, receive the gifts of the Spirit and all are expected, even commanded, to use their gifts for service.
[1976.02 → 1983.02] And now let me slide a bit sideways on this subject and say this.
[1983.02 → 1999.02] If you read through those biblical stories that came out of that patriarchal world, you can't help noticing how often women got things done anyway.
[1999.02 → 2010.02] I mean, and not just women, but others who are sort of outside the power, you know, group.
[2010.02 → 2012.02] They had no positions of authority.
[2012.02 → 2016.02] They were nowhere near the top of the organizational chart.
[2016.02 → 2021.02] And yet they got things done by sheer force of personality.
[2021.02 → 2027.02] Jesus once told a little parable.
[2027.02 → 2030.02] It's been called the parable of the persistent widow.
[2030.02 → 2033.02] It's in the Gospel of Luke.
[2033.02 → 2043.02] And it seems this is a widow who, she had no husband then, and from the sounds of it, no sons or no big brother with big muscles who can hurt you.
[2043.02 → 2048.02] I mean, she had no connections to the right people.
[2048.02 → 2053.02] And so her situation sounds pretty much hopeless.
[2053.02 → 2057.02] Except she had one thing that made all the difference.
[2057.02 → 2060.02] Persistence.
[2060.02 → 2064.02] She was as stubborn as a mule.
[2064.02 → 2067.02] In Jesus' story, this widow was cheated.
[2067.02 → 2074.02] And so she went to a judge, and she said, you know, give me justice against my adversary.
[2074.02 → 2077.02] I've been robbed.
[2077.02 → 2083.02] But, as the story's told, this judge did not fear God and he did not care about people.
[2083.02 → 2088.02] And so he wasn't going to waste his time on no widow.
[2088.02 → 2089.02] I mean, work late for you?
[2089.02 → 2090.02] I mean, really?
[2090.02 → 2092.02] Are you kidding?
[2092.02 → 2093.02] Leave.
[2093.02 → 2094.02] Now.
[2094.02 → 2097.02] And close the door quietly.
[2097.02 → 2101.02] But that widow was not going to take no for an answer.
[2101.02 → 2104.02] She came back again with her demand.
[2104.02 → 2105.02] Give me justice.
[2105.02 → 2106.02] Give me justice.
[2106.02 → 2109.02] And when he refused, she came back again.
[2109.02 → 2114.02] She kept coming back to demand fair treatment.
[2114.02 → 2117.02] She was waiting for the judge first thing in the morning.
[2117.02 → 2119.02] She barged into the lunchroom.
[2119.02 → 2121.02] She wrecked his schedule.
[2121.02 → 2123.02] She haunted his dreams.
[2123.02 → 2130.02] She got on his nerves until finally, finally that judge caved.
[2130.02 → 2145.02] He said, even though I don't fear God or care about what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice.
[2145.02 → 2152.02] Now, I'm not sure where to put this widow in the organizational chart of, you know, people in charge.
[2152.02 → 2154.02] Not very high.
[2154.02 → 2158.02] But you would never call her weak.
[2158.02 → 2160.02] She got things done.
[2160.02 → 2163.02] And she got good things done.
[2163.02 → 2165.02] She got justice.
[2165.02 → 2167.02] And she wasn't the only one.
[2167.02 → 2173.02] You could go reading through the Bible and you could put a whole list of candidates for the Women of Power Award.
[2173.02 → 2176.02] You know, Sarah, wife of Abraham.
[2176.02 → 2179.02] Rebecca, the wife of Isaac.
[2179.02 → 2181.02] Deborah, the judge.
[2181.02 → 2185.02] Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi.
[2185.02 → 2188.02] Esther, Queen of Persia.
[2188.02 → 2190.02] The three New Testament Marys.
[2190.02 → 2194.02] None of these women held high office.
[2194.02 → 2197.02] And yet they were not helpless either.
[2197.02 → 2199.02] They got things done.
[2199.02 → 2200.02] They were tough.
[2200.02 → 2201.02] They were stubborn.
[2201.02 → 2204.02] And they changed the world.
[2204.02 → 2210.02] Well, now let's look at the woman in our reading.
[2210.02 → 2222.02] She came to Jesus, and she asked for his help because her daughter was demon-possessed and suffering terribly.
[2222.02 → 2230.02] Now, in the New Testament, demonic possession would kind of present itself with different symptoms.
[2230.02 → 2233.02] They might look kind of familiar to us, too.
[2233.02 → 2239.02] In some cases, it had all the look of an untreated mental illness.
[2239.02 → 2244.02] The victims would be howling and screaming and tearing their clothes.
[2244.02 → 2250.02] And they were a danger to themselves, and they were a danger to others.
[2250.02 → 2259.02] And then there are other reports of people who simply became mute, couldn't speak, or deaf, couldn't hear, or blind.
[2259.02 → 2262.02] And this, too, was from the demons.
[2262.02 → 2270.02] Now, we do not know how exactly this daughter suffered her demonic possession.
[2270.02 → 2274.02] But we do know that she suffered severely.
[2274.02 → 2283.02] And like any mother who really cares, this one came to Jesus for help.
[2283.02 → 2291.02] Now, the main part of that story we read is a curious kind of conversation with three parties involved.
[2291.02 → 2292.02] There is the woman.
[2292.02 → 2293.02] There is the woman.
[2293.02 → 2297.02] Then there are the disciples.
[2297.02 → 2300.02] And then there is Jesus.
[2300.02 → 2305.02] And it can sound kind of confusing at times.
[2305.02 → 2310.02] Like the people are almost talking past each other.
[2310.02 → 2313.02] But in the end, things become clear.
[2313.02 → 2318.02] And if you go by the Bible, it looks kind of familiar.
[2318.02 → 2325.02] Because a person with no power gets things done.
[2325.02 → 2329.02] And the woman calls out for help.
[2329.02 → 2331.02] Again and again she calls.
[2331.02 → 2334.02] Until the disciples say, send her away.
[2334.02 → 2337.02] For she keeps crying after us.
[2337.02 → 2342.02] I mean, for the disciples, this was a nuisance and a pest.
[2342.02 → 2345.02] And she doesn't matter anyway.
[2345.02 → 2347.02] I mean, why should she matter?
[2347.02 → 2349.02] She's one of them.
[2349.02 → 2351.02] She's one of those foreign women.
[2351.02 → 2355.02] She's a Canaanite from the region of Tyre and Simon.
[2355.02 → 2362.02] One of those people who lived here in the land before Israel came in and conquered it and made it their own.
[2362.02 → 2366.02] Those Canaanites, they had their own gods.
[2366.02 → 2371.02] And after the conquest by Israel, they kept those gods.
[2371.02 → 2380.02] And for years, those gods were a temptation that stole God's people away from the one true faith.
[2380.02 → 2382.02] She's one of them.
[2382.02 → 2384.02] Send her away, say the disciples.
[2388.02 → 2395.02] And then Jesus says, I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.
[2395.02 → 2402.02] Now, Jesus may have been saying that to the woman or maybe to the disciples.
[2402.02 → 2410.02] But either way, it kind of tells us that this shepherd takes care of his sheep only.
[2410.02 → 2411.02] And he says, I'm not here for you.
[2411.02 → 2412.02] And he says, I'm not here for you.
[2412.02 → 2413.02] And he says, I'm not here for you.
[2413.02 → 2417.02] I'm here for my people.
[2417.02 → 2418.02] Not here for you.
[2418.02 → 2423.02] You are not on my pastoral care list.
[2423.02 → 2426.02] So the woman pleads again.
[2426.02 → 2433.02] And then we hear Jesus saying something that sounds even colder and more unfeeling.
[2433.02 → 2436.02] He says, I won't even give you table scraps.
[2436.02 → 2442.02] Or as the text says, it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.
[2442.02 → 2445.02] It's like, ouch.
[2445.02 → 2448.02] Did he really say that?
[2448.02 → 2455.02] And then we have the best line of the story.
[2455.02 → 2463.02] Because the Canaanite woman said, yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that falls from the master's table.
[2463.02 → 2466.02] I mean, this is a mother talking.
[2466.02 → 2470.02] She has fed children, at least one, at a table.
[2470.02 → 2474.02] And she knows what happens when a child is eating at a table.
[2474.02 → 2476.02] Stuff falls to the floor.
[2476.02 → 2477.02] She knows that.
[2477.02 → 2479.02] The dogs know that.
[2479.02 → 2484.02] Actually, the dogs are experts at food falling from the table.
[2484.02 → 2488.02] Which is why, when the meal is on, they're parked close to the table.
[2488.02 → 2493.02] Probably next to the chair of the messiest eater in the family.
[2493.02 → 2497.02] Been there, done that, didn't we?
[2497.02 → 2500.02] So there's something going on in this conversation.
[2500.02 → 2507.02] And it's almost like we are hearing a kind of profession of faith.
[2507.02 → 2514.02] The woman is saying, in the first place, that there's wonderful food at Jesus' table.
[2514.02 → 2524.02] I mean, what Jesus offers is so good, it can heal my daughter even of her demonic possession.
[2524.02 → 2527.02] It can make her whole again.
[2527.02 → 2529.02] And she has just one small bite.
[2529.02 → 2530.02] That would be enough.
[2530.02 → 2538.02] That I would have my beautiful daughter again and not this tortured soul that I see all the time now.
[2538.02 → 2546.02] And she says, in the second place, that there's plenty of food at the table.
[2546.02 → 2547.02] There is an abundance.
[2547.02 → 2549.02] There's more than enough for everyone.
[2549.02 → 2561.02] It's like one of those lovely restaurants, you know, where the paying customers sit in these booths under soft lights and eat all the food they can stand to eat.
[2561.02 → 2568.02] And meanwhile, in the back, behind those swinging doors, there's way more food than they can sell.
[2568.02 → 2573.02] And so it sometimes goes to people who can't pay.
[2573.02 → 2577.02] And the Canaanite woman knows it sort of like that.
[2577.02 → 2584.02] And she says, then, if the dogs can have scraps, then why can't my daughter?
[2584.02 → 2592.02] And then third, the woman is saying, I may not be invited to this meal.
[2592.02 → 2598.02] I might not have a reservation at this restaurant, but I'm here anyway.
[2598.02 → 2601.02] And I'm not going away.
[2601.02 → 2604.02] There's more than enough for me.
[2604.02 → 2605.02] So I'll wait.
[2605.02 → 2606.02] I'll wait.
[2606.02 → 2612.02] I'll wait the way the dog waits beside the chair of the messiest eater in the family.
[2612.02 → 2628.02] It's kind of fascinating because this Canaanite has a kind of understanding, you know, maybe without even knowing it, she has a kind of understanding of the deeper purposes of God.
[2628.02 → 2640.02] Because the conventional thinking at that time was that the Messiah, the Christ would come for his own people, for the children of Israel.
[2640.02 → 2643.02] He would restore their kingdom to its old glory.
[2643.02 → 2653.02] He would bless the sons and daughters of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make them great again.
[2653.02 → 2658.02] And the Canaanite understand that, understood that.
[2658.02 → 2665.02] But she was kind of hoping that other people would be blessed at the same time.
[2665.02 → 2673.02] That in blessing the sons and daughters of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the nations of the world would be blessed.
[2673.02 → 2677.02] Which is exactly the way it was supposed to be.
[2677.02 → 2680.02] That's the great unfolding story of our New Testament.
[2680.02 → 2688.02] That God's grace and favour goes from Israel to every tribe and people and nation and language.
[2688.02 → 2694.02] And that cagey, wily, smarter than you think Canaanite woman.
[2694.02 → 2699.02] She understood the plans of God more than the experts.
[2699.02 → 2704.02] And Jesus knew what to call that.
[2704.02 → 2708.02] You could almost hear the awe in his voice.
[2708.02 → 2712.02] He said, woman, you have great faith.
[2712.02 → 2716.02] Your request is granted.
[2716.02 → 2719.02] So, you are welcome.
[2719.02 → 2723.02] You are welcome at the great banquet.
[2723.02 → 2726.02] Come, feast at my table.
[2726.02 → 2727.02] This is for you.
[2727.02 → 2729.02] This is for your daughter.
[2729.02 → 2733.02] This is for all men and women of great faith.
[2736.02 → 2741.02] So, here's a woman with no official position, no social status, probably no money.
[2741.02 → 2745.02] But she knows where the rich people live.
[2745.02 → 2749.02] She knows that Jesus is rich too.
[2749.02 → 2754.02] I mean, rich in a very unusual and important way.
[2754.02 → 2763.02] In his own way, Jesus is rich, offers far more than all the sugary comfort foods of the world.
[2763.02 → 2768.02] I mean, if you drink his water, you will never be thirsty again.
[2768.02 → 2773.02] If you eat his food, your deepest hunger will be satisfied.
[2773.02 → 2782.02] And if Jesus feeds more people than they need, then it's for sure there will be extra for me.
[2782.02 → 2784.02] That's the thinking of the Canaanite woman.
[2784.02 → 2787.02] She's counting on this.
[2787.02 → 2803.02] I can just imagine her with a wry smile and a twinkle in her eye telling Jesus, surely Jesus, a person as rich as you can feed whole armies from your leftovers.
[2803.02 → 2806.02] So, think of my daughter.
[2806.02 → 2810.02] That's great faith.
[2810.02 → 2819.02] So, here's another biblical example of the power of the powerless.
[2819.02 → 2821.02] The strength of the weak.
[2821.02 → 2823.02] It's one of those upside down things.
[2823.02 → 2825.02] We just keep hearing about it in the Bible.
[2825.02 → 2827.02] The strong will be weak.
[2827.02 → 2828.02] The weak will be strong.
[2828.02 → 2830.02] The great will be the servant.
[2830.02 → 2831.02] The servant will be lifted.
[2831.02 → 2834.02] You know, adults have to become like children.
[2834.02 → 2837.02] It's all backwards and upside down.
[2837.02 → 2840.02] And that's the way it's supposed to be.
[2840.02 → 2847.02] So, it's like Jesus takes our organizational charts.
[2847.02 → 2860.02] You know, those with the boxes, the top box for the chief executive, and then a bunch of vice presidents underneath and below them, a whole row of deputy vice presidents and below them, all that administration.
[2860.02 → 2863.02] Support staff and on and on.
[2863.02 → 2866.02] And power starts at the top and flows to the bottom.
[2866.02 → 2872.02] And Jesus looks at all of that, and he said, well, sure, if that's important to you, go ahead.
[2872.02 → 2875.02] But that's not what you really need.
[2875.02 → 2883.02] What you really need is faith and hope and love.
[2883.02 → 2894.02] And it has to be a sure faith, a constant hope, and a stubborn love that feeds off the table and from the spirit of Jesus.
[2894.02 → 2896.02] That is what you really need.
[2896.02 → 2914.02] You know, many years after Jesus, during the Protestant Reformation, the great reformer, Luther, he talked about the priesthood of all believers.
[2914.02 → 2925.02] Now, the common idea at that time is that God's grace came only through the work of church officials, through the priesthood.
[2925.02 → 2933.02] So if you wanted to live in grace, then you had to be baptized by a church official.
[2933.02 → 2941.02] If you committed a serious sin and wanted to receive forgiveness, then you had to confess to a church official.
[2941.02 → 2945.02] And then he would say, I absolve you.
[2945.02 → 2950.02] That priest would affect your forgiveness.
[2950.02 → 2960.02] And when you died, if you wanted to rest in peace, then you had to be buried by a church official on consecrated ground.
[2960.02 → 2965.02] So the grace of God came through a kind of hierarchical system.
[2965.02 → 2967.02] And that was the thinking at the time.
[2967.02 → 2970.02] And it was widely believed and accepted.
[2970.02 → 2975.02] And then Luther came, and he rebelled against that idea.
[2975.02 → 2978.02] He said that every man is a priest.
[2978.02 → 2979.02] Every woman is a priest.
[2979.02 → 2982.02] We have the priesthood of all believers.
[2982.02 → 2985.02] Anyone can approach God and ask for grace.
[2985.02 → 2993.02] Anyone can confess his or her sins and ask for forgiveness and expect it too, directly from heaven.
[2993.02 → 2998.02] There won't be a middleman between God and yourself collecting a fee.
[2998.02 → 3004.02] Because you are all priests now.
[3004.02 → 3006.02] That's all you need.
[3006.02 → 3011.02] By grace you are saved through faith.
[3011.02 → 3014.02] And this is not your own doing.
[3014.02 → 3017.02] This is a gift from God.
[3017.02 → 3026.02] You know, I have to think that that Canaanite woman, she would make a good Lutheran.
[3026.02 → 3035.02] She dared to take matters into her own hands and approach Jesus by herself.
[3035.02 → 3038.02] That was enough.
[3038.02 → 3040.02] And you know something?
[3040.02 → 3045.02] You and I, we have that same permission.
[3045.02 → 3057.02] We can ask Jesus for grace, for mercy, for forgiveness, for a new beginning, for a new life.
[3057.02 → 3063.02] The food he offers is like no other food.
[3063.02 → 3066.02] The drink he offers is like no other.
[3066.02 → 3069.02] They can make you whole.
[3069.02 → 3076.02] And give you rest and peace and faith and hope and love.
[3076.02 → 3081.02] So, dare to ask him.
[3081.02 → 3085.02] He will graciously and abundantly supply your need.
[3085.02 → 3087.02] Let's pray together.
[3087.02 → 3089.02] Dear Lord, we see this great faith.
[3089.02 → 3099.02] The faith of a woman who seemingly has no power at all except the power of trust and hope.
[3099.02 → 3108.02] And that deep assurance that in Christ, the deepest longings, the greatest needs of our hearts can be met.
[3108.02 → 3117.02] Help us, Lord, to have that same great faith so that in Christ we can find rest and peace.
[3117.02 → 3120.02] In Jesus' name, amen.
[3120.02 → 3141.02] Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace.
[3141.02 → 3151.02] Over all victorious is God's perfect peace.
[3151.02 → 3156.02] Over all victorious is God's perfect peace.
[3156.02 → 3163.02] Over all victorious is God's perfect peace.
[3163.02 → 3173.02] Over all victorious in its bright increase.
[3173.02 → 3179.02] Perfect yet still flowing, full of every day.
[3179.02 → 3181.02] Full of every day.
[3181.02 → 3193.02] Perfect yet still growing, deeper all the way.
[3193.02 → 3203.02] Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed.
[3203.02 → 3215.02] Find Him as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
[3215.02 → 3225.02] Hidden in the home of His mighty hand.
[3225.02 → 3235.02] Where no harm can follow, in His strength we stand.
[3235.02 → 3245.02] We may trust Him fully, all for us to do.
[3245.02 → 3254.02] Those who trust Him wholly, mind Him wholly true.
[3255.02 → 3256.02] Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed.
[3256.02 → 3265.02] Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed.
[3265.02 → 3275.02] Wanting as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
[3275.02 → 3277.02] Trusting in the Lion of His glory,
[3277.02 → 3278.02] O been blessed for us to do.
[3278.02 → 3280.52] Father, ouch are fully blessed.
[3280.52 → 3287.02] Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed.
[3287.02 → 3300.02] I Redeemed as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
[3300.02 → 3323.08] Today's offering is for Servants Anonymous Foundation, which provides refuge, freedom,
[3323.08 → 3329.64] training, and employment for women escaping from human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
[3330.02 → 3338.12] These women are finding healing and transformation with your help and active support.
[3338.12 → 3341.12] The Eakins may come forward at this time.
[3341.12 → 3353.12] Will you come and follow me if I recall your name?
[3353.12 → 3367.02] Will you come and follow me if I recall your name?
[3367.02 → 3376.16] Will you go where you don't know and never be the same?
[3376.62 → 3380.46] Will you let my love be shown?
[3381.28 → 3385.02] Will you let my name be known?
[3385.02 → 3395.12] Will you let my life be grown in you and your in me?
[3397.12 → 3406.46] Lord, your summons echoes true when you but call my name.
[3406.46 → 3415.58] Let me turn and follow you and never be the same.
[3415.58 → 3425.16] In your company I'll know where your love and footsteps show.
[3425.16 → 3434.44] Thus I'll move, I'll live and grow in you and your in me.
[3434.44 → 3454.38] I'd like to lead you in our community prayer.
[3455.48 → 3458.30] The opening line of this prayer is from Psalm 5.
[3459.12 → 3460.08] Let us pray.
[3460.08 → 3465.10] We pray to you, O Lord, you hear our voice in the morning.
[3465.84 → 3469.36] At sunrise we offer our prayers and wait for your answer.
[3470.64 → 3472.98] Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[3473.46 → 3478.52] You created us in your image and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[3479.84 → 3482.62] We are thankful for the communities we live in,
[3483.46 → 3486.06] for services we sometimes take for granted,
[3486.06 → 3487.28] for clean water,
[3487.28 → 3492.16] for public servants such as police, doctors, judges, nurses,
[3493.02 → 3496.72] firefighters, military personnel, paramedics.
[3497.46 → 3500.34] May we be mindful of all these services we have.
[3501.40 → 3503.82] Bless all workers who keep our economy going
[3503.82 → 3506.12] and providing us with goods and services.
[3506.12 → 3509.64] We pray for those who work in agriculture,
[3510.78 → 3512.62] including farmers in our own church,
[3513.08 → 3516.40] who provide us with daily necessities of life.
[3517.52 → 3522.62] We are thankful for your provision in this creation.
[3523.76 → 3526.18] May we be good stewards of your world.
[3526.18 → 3531.76] We pray for our nation, for our prime minister, our premier,
[3531.76 → 3536.36] and the mayors from the communities we represent, Delta and Richmond.
[3537.44 → 3541.72] Give them a sense of justice and provide them with wisdom for leadership.
[3543.08 → 3546.94] Bless our nation as it deals with crisis in wildfires,
[3547.58 → 3550.98] especially in Northwest Territories and here in B.C.
[3550.98 → 3558.04] We pray for our firefighters and for all those who are organizing the response that is needed.
[3559.04 → 3562.94] And we pray for many families who are uprooted at this time,
[3563.72 → 3566.12] living outside their communities in temporary homes.
[3567.42 → 3569.30] We pray for a broken world.
[3570.38 → 3572.04] For Christians around this world,
[3572.04 → 3574.92] we want to especially remember persecuted Christians
[3574.92 → 3579.42] in the countries of Iran, Nigeria, and Pakistan.
[3579.42 → 3582.18] Protect your church there.
[3582.52 → 3588.48] We pray for the leadership of these countries to protect rights and freedoms.
[3589.48 → 3592.42] There are many humanitarian crises around this world.
[3593.10 → 3594.16] It seems overwhelming.
[3595.10 → 3599.58] We especially want to pray for the Sudan and Afghanistan
[3599.58 → 3603.80] and bless all initiatives to bring peace to these places.
[3603.80 → 3609.22] We are very much in our hearts as the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
[3610.10 → 3614.34] We see the images in the media and our hearts go out to all those who are uprooted.
[3615.08 → 3617.64] Millions have fled their homes and have become refugees.
[3618.72 → 3623.22] We pray for all those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[3624.20 → 3629.52] Work in the hearts of those perpetuating this violence and bring it to an end.
[3629.52 → 3635.70] And bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable conflicts.
[3636.66 → 3643.50] We pray for the nations as we see a rise in authoritarian power and totalitarian regimes.
[3644.44 → 3648.86] And now lately, the country of Niger joins them.
[3649.22 → 3650.28] We pray for that country.
[3651.18 → 3652.50] We pray for our church.
[3652.50 → 3659.34] Bless our ministry leaders for Pastor Jason and Associate Pastor Nancy and our church council.
[3660.06 → 3662.94] Also, the volunteers who are leading our many programs.
[3663.78 → 3668.88] We ask a blessing on our ministries as we begin another church year in September.
[3669.74 → 3672.78] Thank you how you have blessed our Chinese ministry.
[3673.36 → 3679.12] May we continue to grow together so that we can become one body, getting to know each other better.
[3679.12 → 3686.24] And we are thankful that Pastor Nancy is slowly recovering her strength and is able to resume her work.
[3687.10 → 3692.36] We pray for the ministries of our CRC denomination, in particular World Renew,
[3693.02 → 3695.52] and Resonate Ministries bringing hope to this world.
[3696.68 → 3703.14] Bless the missionaries we support, the Johnson's in Salmon Arm, and Ajee and Ann and family in Cairo.

[3719.66 → 3722.64] John Von tel, right now, who is in declining health.
[3723.54 → 3730.18] Provide and comfort him and also for Wilma and Johnny Mora gas they support him.
[3730.18 → 3739.40] We also want to remember Moral's father, who has now come home from the hospital, but has still various serious health issues.
[3740.94 → 3748.22] Others who are in your need, we think of Ted in the hospital, and we pray for a blessing on him,
[3748.28 → 3750.70] and also as he celebrates his 98th birthday.
[3750.70 → 3753.42] We thank you for the many years you have provided for him.
[3754.46 → 3760.14] We also pray for healing for Ellie, Annette, Amy, and Tony.
[3761.12 → 3763.78] Lord, you know what each of their needs are.
[3765.04 → 3768.82] Bless the caregivers and families of each of these persons.
[3768.82 → 3776.44] Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts, like mental illness and depression,
[3777.04 → 3781.82] addictions, and broken relationships in family or marriages.
[3782.98 → 3786.86] Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name,
[3787.38 → 3790.52] and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer,
[3791.08 → 3793.88] and to live faithfully in response to your call.
[3794.60 → 3796.34] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[3796.34 → 3797.18] Amen.
[3809.46 → 3815.74] Let me ask you to stand and receive the blessing from your God and Father.
[3816.78 → 3821.34] People of God, grace you, and people who made the...
[3821.34 → 3823.54] Brain cramp here, sorry.
[3824.38 → 3826.02] May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[3826.34 → 3829.48] May the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[3829.56 → 3833.52] May the Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[3833.60 → 3835.34] And God's people say, Amen.
[3835.34 → 3835.56] Amen.
[3835.56 → 3835.64] Amen.
[3836.06 → 3836.24] Amen.
[3837.24 → 3837.26] Amen.
[3837.26 → 3837.64] Amen.
[3837.64 → 3861.36] Salvation belongs to our God,
[3861.36 → 3868.36] who sits upon the throne.
[3868.36 → 3873.36] And unto the Lamb,
[3873.36 → 3876.36] praise and glory,
[3876.36 → 3878.36] wisdom and thanks,
[3878.36 → 3884.36] honour and power and strength.

[3897.36 → 3905.36] Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
[3905.36 → 3911.36] And we the redeemed shall be strong
[3911.36 → 3919.36] in purpose and unity.
[3919.36 → 3924.36] Declaring aloud,
[3924.36 → 3926.36] praise and glory,
[3926.36 → 3930.36] wisdom and thanks,

[3970.96 → 3974.40] forever and ever
[3974.40 → 3976.52] forever and ever
[3999.36 → 4029.34] forever and ever
[4029.36 → 4059.34] forever and ever
[4059.36 → 4089.34] forever and ever
