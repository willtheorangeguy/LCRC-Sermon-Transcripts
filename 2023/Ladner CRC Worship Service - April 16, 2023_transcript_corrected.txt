[21.00 → 22.50] you
[22.50 → 29.00] you
[29.00 → 30.00] Amen.
[59.00 → 60.00] Amen.
[89.00 → 90.00] Amen.
[119.00 → 120.00] Amen.
[149.00 → 150.00] Amen.
[179.00 → 180.00] Amen.
[209.00 → 210.00] Amen.
[239.00 → 240.00] Amen.
[269.00 → 270.00] Amen.
[299.00 → 300.00] Amen.
[329.00 → 348.26] Well, good morning.
[348.26 → 349.26] Good morning.
[349.26 → 351.06] My name is Ryan Van Viet.
[351.06 → 354.88] I'd like to welcome you to Ladder Christian Reformed Church this Sunday.
[354.88 → 358.86] We're here to gather and worship our risen Saviour.
[358.86 → 361.60] If this is your first time joining us, we're glad to have you.
[361.60 → 365.30] And I'd like to invite you to stay after the service to join us for some coffee.
[365.30 → 373.80] And if you're a kid, don't worry, we have juice as well, so you don't have to drink coffee.
[373.80 → 376.80] So community is important to us, and we'd love to get to know you.
[376.80 → 380.60] Before we start this service, there are a couple of quick announcements.
[380.60 → 385.50] So next week Sunday, that's April 23rd, we will be doing an evening prayer service at
[385.50 → 387.22] 7 p.m.
[387.22 → 393.92] We will gather to pray for industry and agriculture, education, government, family, and God's mission
[393.92 → 395.38] for our church.
[395.38 → 399.20] We'll also be doing some singing with Ellie leading us on guitar, and we hope to serve
[399.20 → 400.40] some coffee and dessert.
[400.40 → 404.28] So if you're the type of person that likes to make cookies as much as eat them, we'd love
[404.28 → 406.04] to get your help.
[406.04 → 409.08] There's a sign-up sheet in the back, and also if you'd like to help with coffee, that would
[409.08 → 412.28] be really appreciated as well.
[412.28 → 417.02] And this morning was our inaugural first session of spring cross-training.
[417.02 → 421.38] If you don't know what cross-training is, it's not a total body workout, but it's actually
[421.38 → 427.02] a ministry that's devoted to discussions, devotionals, and testimonials.
[427.02 → 431.52] And it happens before the service every Sunday, and it'll be happening for about, I believe,
[431.52 → 433.68] six weeks from today.
[433.68 → 434.68] So every Sunday.
[434.68 → 436.86] And that's at the fellowship hall at the back.
[436.86 → 439.08] So yeah, that's it for announcements.
[439.08 → 443.62] And this morning we will be welcoming Pastor Bill Tuning to the pulpit to bring us God's
[443.62 → 449.08] word from 1 Corinthians, focusing on the resurrection and why it's central to our relationship with
[449.08 → 451.58] God.
[451.58 → 455.70] So now please stand if you're able to join in a responsive call to worship from Psalm
[455.70 → 461.20] 100.
[461.20 → 464.50] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[464.50 → 465.92] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[465.92 → 470.02] Come before him with joyful songs.
[470.02 → 472.58] Know that the Lord is our God.
[472.58 → 477.68] It is he who made us, and we are his, and we are the people, the sheep of his pasture.
[477.68 → 483.78] And his courts with praise.
[483.78 → 488.12] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[488.12 → 491.78] For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[491.78 → 495.20] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[495.20 → 496.20] Let us pray.
[496.20 → 503.14] Holy, holy, holy God, your glory fills the heavens and the earth.
[503.14 → 505.42] By your hand we are created.
[505.42 → 507.56] By your goodness we are sustained.
[507.56 → 509.92] By your mercy we are saved.
[509.92 → 512.86] By your sacrifice we are made new.
[512.86 → 516.16] We glorify you alone, Lord.
[516.16 → 520.48] May our time here this morning be made perfect in the name of your son Jesus.
[520.48 → 522.92] Amen.
[522.92 → 525.52] Our heavenly Father has called us to worship and now greets us.
[525.52 → 529.86] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy
[529.86 → 531.02] Spirit be with you all.
[531.02 → 533.96] And as God greeted us, so now let us greet one another.

[598.24 → 606.24] All nature sings and round me rings the music of his ears.
[606.66 → 614.62] This is my Father's world, my rescue in the Lord.
[614.62 → 623.08] Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, and of wonders bright.
[623.08 → 634.92] This is my Father's world, the birds that bear all's ways.
[635.36 → 643.34] The pouring light, the lily, the king and the ringer's great.
[643.34 → 651.34] This is my Father's world, he shines in all that's fair.
[652.38 → 659.94] In the rustling grass I hear him pass, speaks to me everywhere.
[659.94 → 673.94] This is my Father's world, all that came out for him.
[673.94 → 683.22] Now though the rock seems off so strong, but it is a world that I am.
[683.84 → 692.80] This is my Father's world, nor should my heart be sad.
[692.80 → 698.02] The Lord is king, let the heavens ring.
[698.38 → 702.80] God reigns and the earth be proud.
[702.80 → 726.30] As morning dawns and evening fades,
[726.30 → 731.30] You inspire songs of praise.
[731.30 → 736.30] That rise from earth to touch your heart.
[736.30 → 741.30] And glorify your name.
[741.30 → 747.30] Your name is a strong and mighty tower.
[747.30 → 752.30] Your name is a shelter like no other.
[752.30 → 756.30] Your name is a shelter like no other.
[756.30 → 758.30] And the nations sing it louder,
[758.30 → 770.30] Because nothing has the power to say but your name.
[770.30 → 775.30] Jesus, in your name we pray.
[775.30 → 780.30] Come and fill our hearts today.
[780.30 → 786.30] Lord, give us strength to live for you.
[786.30 → 790.30] And glorify your name.
[790.30 → 794.30] your name is a strong and mighty tower.
[794.30 → 795.30] Your name is a strong and mighty tower.
[795.30 → 797.30] But your name is a shelter like no other.
[797.30 → 800.30] Your name is a shelter like no other.
[800.30 → 802.14] Your name is a shelter like no other.

[1028.42 → 1032.66] My soul is in deep anguish. How long Lord? How long?
[1033.22 → 1037.64] Turn Lord and deliver me. Save me because of your unfailing love.
[1038.08 → 1043.46] Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises your name from the grave?
[1043.78 → 1046.98] I am worn out from my groaning. All night long
[1046.98 → 1053.10] I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. My eyes grow weak with sorrow.
[1053.38 → 1056.24] They fail because of all of my foes.
[1056.24 → 1064.64] Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we feel the burden of our sinfulness weighing down upon us.
[1065.02 → 1068.74] We know that we have failed to live our lives in a way that is pleasing to you.
[1069.18 → 1074.54] We forget your sacrifice on the cross and tremble at the thought of your justice upon us.
[1074.94 → 1080.04] We have turned from you, done evil in your sight, and left your kingdom work undone.
[1080.44 → 1085.18] Then, for our glory, we seek out worldly payments for our spiritual debts.
[1085.18 → 1088.32] But we find that we are further behind than when we started.
[1089.14 → 1093.12] The pain and suffering from this world cannot be undone by human hands.
[1093.96 → 1096.32] You, O Lord, do not delight in burnt offerings.
[1096.86 → 1099.98] Instead, may our sacrifice be a broken spirit and a contrite heart.
[1100.52 → 1101.98] Deliver us, Lord, from our guilt.
[1102.64 → 1105.46] You, who are our great God and our Saviour.
[1105.46 → 1106.52] Amen.
[1106.52 → 1106.60] Amen.
[1108.74 → 1113.22] There's a story from the American Civil War that a soldier brought before the general.
[1113.56 → 1116.02] A soldier is brought before the general for an infraction.
[1116.58 → 1119.96] The soldier is trembling, and the general, upon seeing this, says to the soldier,
[1120.42 → 1121.30] Don't worry, son.
[1121.68 → 1122.76] You'll find justice here.
[1123.42 → 1125.94] The soldier replies, I know that, general.
[1126.30 → 1127.58] That's what I'm so afraid of.
[1127.58 → 1130.04] I think we can all relate.
[1130.72 → 1134.80] We read the Apostles' Creed, and we're told that after ascending into heaven,
[1134.96 → 1140.38] Jesus, seated at the right hand of the Almighty God, will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1141.46 → 1147.10] Our God's perfect righteousness demands perfect justice, and we are all far from perfect.
[1147.82 → 1149.66] This seems to pose a bit of a problem.
[1150.48 → 1152.92] What possible comfort can this offer us?
[1153.72 → 1155.82] The Heidelberg Catechism provides us with the answer.
[1155.82 → 1156.76] Let's read it together.
[1160.70 → 1170.18] In all my sorrow and persecution, I lift my head up and eagerly await, as judge, from heaven,
[1170.28 → 1177.96] the very same person who before has submitted himself to the judgment of God for my sake,
[1178.82 → 1181.38] has removed the curse from me.
[1181.38 → 1192.96] He will cast his enemies in everlasting condemnation, but he will take from me and all mis chosen ones
[1192.96 → 1197.32] his heaven joy and glory.
[1197.32 → 1205.86] How can it be that you, my God, should die for me, for us all?
[1206.76 → 1212.44] Brothers and sisters of the risen Saviour, our many sins are paid for in full.
[1213.10 → 1216.76] Let us sing of God's infinite mercy and perfect righteousness.
[1216.76 → 1221.92] Brothers and sisters of the risen Saviour, our many sins are paid for in full.
[1221.92 → 1222.86] Please promise.
[1222.86 → 1223.14] Please promise.

[1469.80 → 1490.82] You know, the author of that hymn, Charles Wesley wrote, I believe, over 1500 hymns.
[1490.82 → 1497.12] hymns. I think that one's got to be one of his best. At this time, we're going to dismiss the
[1497.12 → 1502.72] kids, so kids ages three through grade five can be hot off the kid's life. Thank you for sitting so
[1502.72 → 1507.46] patiently this far, and now you can enjoy the worship of God in your own special way.
[1508.62 → 1513.68] And as you guys head out, I'd like to invite up Pastor Bill Tuning to the pulpit to bring us
[1513.68 → 1514.14] God's word.
[1520.82 → 1544.16] Well, very good to be with you this morning to worship our Lord together, to raise our
[1544.16 → 1551.10] voices in praise of Jesus, our risen and living Saviour.
[1553.28 → 1565.00] You know, we sometimes take it for granted. In the days of Jesus, there were what they called
[1565.00 → 1572.52] Sadducee's. They were people who didn't believe that there would be any resurrection, and they
[1572.52 → 1576.96] had to deal with them. They also had to deal in the days of the New Testament church in
[1576.96 → 1585.86] Corinth with Greeks who, while they believed in the immortality of the soul, they weren't
[1585.86 → 1598.10] in the Holy Testament, they were in the Holy Testament. And so there were temptations in the church to
[1598.10 → 1611.46] not take Christ's resurrection seriously. And sometimes I wonder if we do. If we really live every day
[1611.46 → 1620.20] in the day in the awareness that Jesus is alive, He's our Saviour.
[1620.20 → 1629.78] So listen, we shouldn't take this. Do you believe Jesus actually physically rose from the dead? You
[1629.78 → 1640.98] don't have to answer. We're not a Pentecostal church just yet. But, you know, many people believe in heaven.
[1640.98 → 1655.72] A lot of songs sing about heaven. And so we think about that. I've known a number of people who told me about
[1655.72 → 1665.80] their near-death experience. And I've read books about that. But that's not the resurrection, is it? One day we're
[1665.80 → 1678.62] going to be raised. Do you believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus? And that one day, if we die, I mean, the Lord
[1678.62 → 1690.02] may come back before then, that you too, by faith in Jesus, will be raised. It happened in the early church. That's why
[1690.02 → 1699.30] Paul writes 1 Corinthians 15, that some people started to question any belief in resurrection. They didn't see any,
[1699.86 → 1706.26] what we call today, scientific evidence that people were raised from the dead.
[1708.58 → 1718.34] They couldn't accept there was life beyond the grave. And so Paul had to deal with that because he said,
[1718.34 → 1723.38] if that's who you are, if that's who you are, and you're starting to wonder about whether anybody
[1723.38 → 1730.58] can be raised, then you're going to wonder whether Jesus was raised. Where's that going to lead you in
[1730.58 → 1739.86] terms of your faith? So if you turn with me to 1 Corinthians 15, it's on page 856 in your pew Bibles. I'd like to read through
[1739.86 → 1750.50] all the way through to verse 22. Ultimately, I see we're skipping a few verses. We don't really have to, but
[1750.50 → 1761.38] let's begin by reading those first eight verses where Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, brothers and sisters,
[1761.38 → 1772.34] I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
[1774.26 → 1787.22] By this gospel, you are saved. If you hold firmly to the word I preached to you, otherwise you have believed in vain.
[1787.22 → 1798.48] For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance. You know, for the first 300 years in the church,
[1798.48 → 1806.06] before there were any creeds, how did faith get passed on? By what you might say, tradition. They told the story.
[1806.54 → 1815.24] They shared their faith. That's how it happened. And that's how Paul also shared what he had received with those in Corinth.
[1815.24 → 1826.92] I passed on to you as of first importance. And this is what it was. Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures, referring to the Old Testament, that he was buried,
[1828.22 → 1837.92] that he was raised on the third day, according to the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cafes, Peter, that is, and then to the 12.
[1837.92 → 1851.22] After that, he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at that time, most of whom are still living, though some have,
[1851.56 → 1853.86] that's how he spoke of death, fallen asleep.
[1853.86 → 1870.68] Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. And last of all, he appeared in person, as you know the story, likely to Paul, to me, as to one abnormally born.
[1870.68 → 1875.66] Let's just leave it here for a little while. We'll pick up the passage in a bit.
[1875.82 → 1881.62] But, you know, this is really pretty good evidence, isn't it? 500 people.
[1882.84 → 1889.82] That would be, today, certainly accepted in a court of law. If you're in trouble, you know, you've had an accident or whatever,
[1889.96 → 1894.84] and it's your word against somebody else's, and you've got 500 people ready to stand up and say,
[1894.84 → 1907.04] no, no, no, no, I saw this. But it's still not proof. It's just evidence. It's only the word of people who you choose,
[1907.12 → 1916.68] you're going to either trust them or you won't. So we are really left in the end, aren't we, with he said versus she said.
[1916.68 → 1922.52] And whose testimony do you want to believe?
[1924.54 → 1932.02] I had a good friend, I was mentoring, he was heading for ministry, and he came to the conclusion he didn't really want to believe that this, in fact, happened.
[1933.18 → 1938.74] The resurrection, and that's what you get in liberal churches today, that's what happens in your heart.
[1938.74 → 1945.46] That's the most important thing, that you live, that you have a resurrection life.
[1945.84 → 1951.36] But it's not important that Jesus be resurrected, just that you are.
[1952.74 → 1955.18] It's a resurrection faith, they would say.
[1955.18 → 1971.64] So what Paul does next in 1 Corinthians 15 is he thinks through the implications of if it's true that Jesus hasn't been raised.
[1973.18 → 1979.66] In other words, for the sake of argument, let's assume for a while that it didn't happen, Easter.
[1979.66 → 1982.92] Sometimes that's a good approach to take.
[1984.38 → 1985.64] So you don't believe in God.
[1988.24 → 1989.74] That's fine, that's your right.
[1991.08 → 1992.54] Take God out of the picture.
[1994.06 → 1995.44] So what are you left with?
[1997.10 → 1998.80] How do you explain your origin?
[2000.08 → 2001.44] How do you explain your future?
[2003.64 → 2006.26] How do you explain the vastness of this world?
[2007.40 → 2009.36] That's what our culture is wrestling with.
[2009.66 → 2013.20] So you've written God off.
[2014.20 → 2016.58] The question is, is what do you write in his place?
[2018.38 → 2022.92] So Paul says, why don't we assume for a moment that there is no resurrection?
[2025.20 → 2028.32] You don't mind Easter bunnies and eggs and all that stuff.
[2029.20 → 2031.94] But you don't really believe that people come back from the dead.
[2033.00 → 2034.78] So what do you do with your Christianity?
[2034.78 → 2046.06] So in the next verses 12, so after Paul says a few words about himself, how he's the least of all the apostles and how God yet had called him.
[2046.06 → 2051.64] But then in verse 12 of that same chapter, Paul goes on to follow that reasoning.
[2051.64 → 2061.64] If it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[2061.76 → 2067.08] If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
[2067.08 → 2071.64] And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless.
[2072.54 → 2074.30] And so is your faith.
[2074.72 → 2075.64] More than that.
[2075.64 → 2079.70] We are then found to be false witnesses about God.
[2080.78 → 2085.80] For we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead.
[2086.88 → 2090.24] But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
[2090.78 → 2093.88] For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
[2093.98 → 2099.42] And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile.
[2100.86 → 2103.10] You are still in your sins.
[2103.10 → 2108.58] And then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
[2109.66 → 2118.00] If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
[2119.22 → 2126.10] But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[2126.10 → 2133.22] For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
[2133.66 → 2140.76] For in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
[2140.76 → 2147.02] Let me pray with you.
[2147.02 → 2151.80] Father, as we think about these verses and the implication for our lives,
[2152.60 → 2159.40] may the truth of your word impact our minds and our hearts
[2159.40 → 2168.80] and direct our steps, the way in which we speak and act.
[2170.40 → 2179.00] And so we pray, Holy Spirit, that we may have ears for what you are saying to us through this passage.
[2179.00 → 2179.96] Amen.
[2179.96 → 2180.12] Amen.
[2182.46 → 2188.62] When it comes to the resurrection, you might say there's only two ways to look at it.
[2188.70 → 2198.98] You can use it as the basis from which to start and accept it as evidence and then look forward from there.
[2198.98 → 2207.38] Or we can think backward from today and take the lack of evidence that people are raised
[2207.38 → 2212.88] as looking back and saying, so then I'm not so sure if it actually happened.
[2214.90 → 2223.04] And Paul is arguing that for us, Easter is evidence that ought to lead us to faith.
[2224.50 → 2227.52] Christianity is such a reasonable faith.
[2227.52 → 2232.58] And if it doesn't make sense, we won't believe it.
[2233.56 → 2236.24] We could fake it, but you won't really believe it.
[2236.80 → 2237.86] It's got to connect.
[2238.66 → 2239.68] And Paul knows this.
[2240.42 → 2248.50] So he says, think through the implications of what happened on Easter,
[2249.00 → 2252.34] and you'll see the relevance for your faith.
[2253.48 → 2256.26] This is how he reasons.
[2256.26 → 2258.26] And there are five points.
[2258.96 → 2264.14] If Christ is not raised, and this is that first slide, why should I believe in him?
[2264.78 → 2265.54] What's the point?
[2267.06 → 2276.22] I mean, good ideas and teachings, but why ultimately should I trust in him as my only comfort,
[2276.48 → 2278.02] not just in life but in death?
[2278.02 → 2281.40] And secondly, why did Jesus even let himself die?
[2281.40 → 2289.10] I mean, he went willingly to pay for sin, but if he's dead and gone,
[2290.54 → 2296.48] then the cross is of very little effect and forgiveness is no longer available.
[2296.48 → 2305.48] So if the resurrection didn't happen, thirdly, how are we to handle our own death?
[2306.70 → 2308.24] What happens when we die?
[2308.24 → 2313.94] And if there's no resurrection, is there any hope of life after death?
[2315.20 → 2316.44] What is our future?
[2317.68 → 2321.28] And lastly, what's the point of the church?
[2322.48 → 2324.04] It's really what Paul's asking.
[2324.04 → 2326.14] Why gather?
[2326.62 → 2330.44] Pity us, poor people, here in gathering in Ladder.
[2330.54 → 2331.80] We might as well just shut down.
[2331.90 → 2334.00] There are a lot of other things you could do with your money.
[2335.54 → 2342.66] However, if Christ has been raised, then there are answers to these negative points.
[2342.66 → 2346.30] And Paul states it right up front in verse 20.
[2346.50 → 2349.60] He's very, Christ has indeed been raised from the dead.
[2349.68 → 2350.84] He can't prove it.
[2350.86 → 2352.86] He can only give evidence.
[2353.80 → 2356.20] Faith is not something we can force on anyone.
[2356.34 → 2359.64] You simply tell them the story of what Jesus accomplished,
[2359.90 → 2361.06] and they believe it or they don't.
[2363.06 → 2369.78] Faith flows from accepting what we believe as facts.
[2369.78 → 2373.32] Jesus arose.
[2374.08 → 2379.94] And when we accept that, it makes all the difference in our life.
[2382.14 → 2384.98] Five things we'll look at once we accept the fact.
[2386.22 → 2389.86] And that's how we see the resurrection has incredible relevance.
[2390.86 → 2397.08] First, because Jesus arose, our faith now makes sense.
[2397.08 → 2402.58] Because without it, it really is a huge waste of time.
[2404.30 → 2407.40] As he says in verse 14,
[2407.52 → 2413.28] If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless.
[2414.28 → 2417.14] I know, some of you think preaching is useless.
[2418.42 → 2421.26] I've heard that a number of times.
[2423.46 → 2424.94] That was pointless.
[2424.94 → 2427.04] That's why I thought this morning I'd have five points.
[2427.12 → 2428.88] None of you could go away driving from here.
[2428.96 → 2429.86] Well, that was pointless.
[2432.12 → 2433.04] Five, five.
[2433.20 → 2435.72] You might call them five alive if you really want to.
[2435.84 → 2437.82] But what's the point of preaching?
[2439.52 → 2442.96] Well, okay, so you don't think much about preaching.
[2443.04 → 2444.02] I'm going to sidetrack here.
[2444.04 → 2445.76] I remember doing church planting in New West,
[2445.84 → 2449.22] and there was a lawyer dealing with a Christian couple that was divorcing.
[2449.34 → 2450.82] She couldn't get her head around all this.
[2450.82 → 2452.52] So she sat down in my office.
[2452.58 → 2453.24] She didn't believe.
[2454.96 → 2456.68] And we're going through, and she's talking.
[2456.80 → 2460.58] And I said, well, you know, you can't go by how Christians behave,
[2460.70 → 2462.18] because then you're going to want to lose your faith.
[2462.22 → 2463.98] You've got to look at Jesus himself.
[2464.12 → 2467.24] Go through the scriptures and see how he preached.
[2467.32 → 2468.02] There, she said.
[2468.10 → 2468.40] There you go.
[2468.46 → 2469.06] I said, what's that?
[2469.22 → 2469.84] He preached.
[2470.88 → 2474.06] She thought preaching was talking down.
[2474.66 → 2476.74] See, so she had something against Jesus.
[2476.74 → 2479.94] And sometimes people have something against all preaching.
[2480.60 → 2482.06] They don't want to submit to it.
[2482.44 → 2482.88] It's useless.
[2484.30 → 2488.06] Well, if that's the case, and it is the case if Jesus hasn't ever,
[2488.20 → 2490.30] but so is your faith.
[2493.48 → 2497.34] If Christ has not been raised, he says again in verse 17,
[2497.54 → 2500.84] he emphasizes it twice, it's futile.
[2502.04 → 2503.14] There's no point.
[2503.14 → 2506.64] The living Bible says if he's still dead,
[2506.76 → 2511.36] then all your trust in God is empty, worthless, hopeless.
[2512.50 → 2517.20] But because of Easter, we have a ground on which to stand.
[2517.94 → 2520.12] The only reason the disciples who,
[2520.86 → 2525.26] they were not anticipating Jesus' resurrection in spite of everything he said,
[2526.02 → 2527.08] predicted it often.
[2528.48 → 2529.56] They had disbanded.
[2529.56 → 2533.30] Jesus had to meet them a number of times
[2533.30 → 2537.50] and watch him, you know, eat bread and walk with him
[2537.50 → 2538.68] and listen to him
[2538.68 → 2541.30] and ultimately watch him.
[2542.30 → 2542.78] Amazing.
[2542.96 → 2544.98] As he ascended into heaven.
[2547.08 → 2550.58] And really when the Holy Spirit, after prayer, hit them,
[2551.28 → 2554.92] they realized Jesus is alive.
[2556.18 → 2557.50] And it made sense.
[2557.50 → 2560.94] No one dies for a lie.
[2563.28 → 2565.46] No one risks their lives for an illusion.
[2567.36 → 2571.02] And that's why the New Testament church took off.
[2572.46 → 2574.14] They served a risen Saviour,
[2574.64 → 2577.60] and it made sense for them to believe in him.
[2577.60 → 2581.86] And if not, as Paul would say,
[2582.34 → 2584.86] otherwise the disciples are all liars.
[2587.12 → 2589.84] And all the preachers since then,
[2589.94 → 2593.16] Augustine, the reformers,
[2594.22 → 2595.22] and quite frankly,
[2595.42 → 2599.58] Pastor Jason is giving you fake news every Sunday.
[2600.48 → 2601.74] I was joking with him.
[2601.74 → 2603.92] You don't have to call him Jason True anymore.
[2603.92 → 2606.00] I should call him Jason Fossil.
[2607.44 → 2609.48] Okay, I'm bad with puns.
[2609.56 → 2611.14] I'm just terrible with that.
[2611.28 → 2615.56] Anyway, if the resurrection didn't happen,
[2616.58 → 2618.54] God himself is a liar.
[2618.54 → 2622.74] But indeed, as Paul says,
[2622.86 → 2623.48] he's been risen,
[2623.62 → 2625.22] and that's why your faith makes sense.
[2625.30 → 2625.88] And secondly,
[2626.18 → 2628.28] that's why forgiveness is available.
[2629.84 → 2631.28] But if he hasn't been raised,
[2631.40 → 2633.06] you and I are still in our sins.
[2633.26 → 2636.14] It's our personal sin
[2636.14 → 2639.76] that keeps us from enjoying a relationship with God,
[2639.76 → 2644.02] and essentially an eternal life with him
[2644.02 → 2645.52] in heaven and on the new earth.
[2646.68 → 2650.04] And the reason Christ died was to pay for sins.
[2650.82 → 2652.54] But if when he said it's finished,
[2652.58 → 2653.04] as you know,
[2653.10 → 2654.14] it really was finished,
[2654.24 → 2655.40] and he was all done
[2655.40 → 2656.90] and didn't rise again,
[2658.28 → 2660.98] then his death is of really no effect.
[2662.74 → 2664.76] In Romans 4 verse 25,
[2665.04 → 2665.88] in the Living Bible,
[2666.04 → 2666.74] Paul says,
[2666.74 → 2668.42] He died for our sins
[2668.42 → 2669.50] and rose again
[2669.50 → 2671.44] to make us right with God,
[2671.92 → 2674.92] filling us with God's goodness.
[2678.48 → 2681.56] Our greatest enemy is not death.
[2683.74 → 2685.60] It's later called in the chapter
[2685.60 → 2686.62] the last enemy,
[2686.78 → 2687.76] but it's not our greatest.
[2687.92 → 2689.36] Our greatest enemy is sin.
[2691.84 → 2693.56] Death came into the world
[2693.56 → 2695.10] because of sin.
[2695.10 → 2698.60] And if our sin is not dealt with,
[2699.06 → 2700.94] we die an eternal death.
[2703.18 → 2705.16] Christ's rising declares
[2705.16 → 2706.98] the power of sin
[2706.98 → 2708.80] has been broken,
[2709.42 → 2711.86] and that's why we are forgiven.
[2713.42 → 2718.36] And sin no longer need to have power over us.
[2718.36 → 2722.08] Thirdly, because of the resurrection,
[2722.68 → 2725.68] the fear of death is gone,
[2725.92 → 2729.90] or certainly mostly diminished.
[2730.96 → 2733.66] And we can actually die with confidence.
[2735.26 → 2738.04] However, as verse 18 says,
[2738.16 → 2740.20] if Christ is not raised,
[2740.82 → 2744.56] then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ
[2744.56 → 2745.96] are lost.
[2746.84 → 2748.18] But he did arise,
[2748.34 → 2748.98] and therefore,
[2749.16 → 2750.48] verse 20 to 21,
[2750.72 → 2752.50] since death came through a man,
[2752.58 → 2754.10] the resurrection of the dead
[2754.10 → 2756.14] comes also through a man,
[2756.24 → 2757.68] for as in Adam all die,
[2758.08 → 2758.98] in Christ,
[2759.24 → 2762.10] all will be made alive.
[2762.94 → 2764.38] And then in verse 26,
[2764.52 → 2766.66] the last enemy to be destroyed
[2766.66 → 2768.24] is death.
[2768.24 → 2771.60] But if Christ did not rise,
[2771.72 → 2772.86] then death is certainly
[2772.86 → 2776.40] something we should fear.
[2777.06 → 2777.90] Then when it's over,
[2778.02 → 2778.42] it's over.
[2780.62 → 2782.58] Then the funeral is the last word.
[2783.84 → 2784.72] Nothing to say.
[2785.98 → 2786.86] Some of you know,
[2787.36 → 2788.46] probably a number of you know,
[2788.58 → 2789.16] Jake Lewin.
[2789.22 → 2790.34] He was the principal here,
[2790.52 → 2792.64] and his sister Nell died,
[2792.72 → 2793.86] actually, on Easter Sunday.
[2794.82 → 2797.74] And so I was at the graveside
[2797.74 → 2800.16] on Friday morning there
[2800.16 → 2803.80] with Jake and the rest of the Lewin family,
[2803.96 → 2805.60] and Nell had asked that
[2805.60 → 2808.26] 1 John 5, 13,
[2808.44 → 2809.92] be a text where it says
[2809.92 → 2813.32] that those who believe in Jesus,
[2813.54 → 2814.38] the Son of God,
[2814.80 → 2817.80] may know you have eternal life.
[2818.52 → 2819.44] It's who she was.
[2821.32 → 2822.58] He had very strong,
[2822.58 → 2823.06] I learned.
[2823.16 → 2823.84] I didn't know her,
[2823.92 → 2825.32] but she had very strong,
[2825.88 → 2827.40] powerful faith.
[2827.54 → 2829.10] Jake and Gerda and I said,
[2829.16 → 2830.28] we're in a small group together.
[2830.38 → 2831.78] That's how we got to know about Nell.
[2833.34 → 2834.92] But if you stand by a grave
[2834.92 → 2835.76] and you start wondering
[2835.76 → 2836.56] what's going to happen,
[2836.96 → 2837.72] because you can do that.
[2837.78 → 2838.32] You look at this,
[2838.40 → 2839.28] oh my goodness.
[2840.50 → 2842.28] That body goes into the ground.
[2842.46 → 2843.68] And Paul goes on to say,
[2844.08 → 2844.78] got to be careful
[2844.78 → 2845.80] how you look at this.
[2845.94 → 2846.80] Here's the image.
[2846.98 → 2847.72] It's a seed.
[2848.32 → 2850.12] It's a little wrinkled up seed.
[2850.12 → 2850.50] You know,
[2850.56 → 2851.42] she was 98,
[2851.50 → 2852.08] almost 99,
[2852.32 → 2853.08] all wrinkled up
[2853.08 → 2854.16] when I saw the pictures.
[2854.70 → 2855.48] But he says,
[2855.54 → 2856.52] it's going to be raised
[2856.52 → 2858.10] in imperishable body.
[2859.80 → 2860.42] And that's why
[2860.42 → 2862.10] at the end of chapter 15,
[2862.30 → 2863.24] Paul says,
[2863.40 → 2863.64] where,
[2863.80 → 2864.26] oh death,
[2864.32 → 2865.16] is your victory?
[2865.42 → 2865.72] Where,
[2865.92 → 2866.50] oh death,
[2866.56 → 2867.70] is your sting?
[2868.56 → 2869.98] Thanks be to God.
[2870.08 → 2871.56] He gives us the victory
[2871.56 → 2875.16] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2875.16 → 2875.28] Christ.
[2876.56 → 2877.56] You might say,
[2878.12 → 2880.24] the bee that stings
[2880.24 → 2882.20] has become a fly
[2882.20 → 2884.46] that we can swat.
[2884.88 → 2886.42] You don't have to run
[2886.42 → 2887.86] from a fly.
[2887.96 → 2888.86] You will from a bee.
[2888.94 → 2889.82] You'll get up and go.
[2890.36 → 2891.68] But a fly,
[2891.86 → 2892.20] you can,
[2892.28 → 2893.48] you can live with it.
[2894.86 → 2895.92] Death isn't nice.
[2896.62 → 2898.64] But you can not have to worry
[2898.64 → 2899.96] about dying.
[2901.02 → 2902.48] You'll go to be with the Lord.
[2902.48 → 2905.58] Thank you for Easter.
[2905.72 → 2906.16] And also,
[2906.32 → 2907.06] number four,
[2907.20 → 2908.06] because of that,
[2908.24 → 2909.70] we have a future.
[2911.48 → 2912.42] It's immediate.
[2913.66 → 2915.44] We're living that future now.
[2917.60 → 2919.00] Without hope for tomorrow,
[2919.10 → 2920.26] we become rather careless
[2920.26 → 2921.12] about today.
[2922.96 → 2925.00] 1 Corinthians 15, 32,
[2925.16 → 2925.84] Paul reasons,
[2926.00 → 2928.30] if the dead are not raised,
[2928.30 → 2928.70] hey,
[2929.38 → 2930.76] let us eat and drink
[2930.76 → 2932.10] for tomorrow,
[2932.68 → 2933.80] we die.
[2936.02 → 2937.08] Remember when we were
[2937.08 → 2938.38] at Disneyland years ago,
[2938.48 → 2939.90] my wife saved up Lynn.
[2940.06 → 2940.14] She,
[2940.78 → 2941.84] for the kids.
[2942.14 → 2943.60] And we went three days
[2943.60 → 2944.24] to Disneyland
[2944.24 → 2945.56] in California.
[2946.52 → 2947.04] Well,
[2947.10 → 2947.66] that was,
[2947.92 → 2949.20] that was the attitude.
[2951.42 → 2952.24] You know,
[2952.44 → 2954.90] we're not going to be here
[2954.90 → 2955.86] in three more days.
[2955.98 → 2956.52] We're going to make
[2956.52 → 2957.28] the most of this.
[2957.28 → 2958.68] We're going to eat
[2958.68 → 2959.28] and drink
[2959.28 → 2960.08] and be merry
[2960.08 → 2961.10] and we win on it.
[2961.20 → 2962.30] There are many rides,
[2962.38 → 2962.58] you know,
[2962.62 → 2963.44] and if you aren't careful
[2963.44 → 2964.40] when you live that way,
[2964.64 → 2965.74] you get a little pushy.
[2965.98 → 2966.12] Hey,
[2966.16 → 2966.90] I'm making the most
[2966.90 → 2967.38] of this life.
[2967.44 → 2968.26] Get out of my road.
[2969.48 → 2970.74] And that's not
[2970.74 → 2971.82] how we need to live.
[2974.62 → 2975.60] In fear of
[2975.60 → 2976.74] what's coming
[2976.74 → 2977.70] down the pike,
[2979.62 → 2980.62] a fellow afterwards
[2980.62 → 2981.74] when we were having lunch
[2981.74 → 2985.24] said,
[2985.38 → 2986.50] all this talk
[2986.50 → 2986.88] because they
[2986.88 → 2988.34] had lots of opportunity
[2988.34 → 2989.54] at the funeral of Nell
[2989.54 → 2991.78] to tell stories about her
[2991.78 → 2992.52] and there was a lot of
[2992.52 → 2993.56] talk about heaven
[2993.56 → 2996.14] and some songs about heaven.
[2997.40 → 2997.68] I don't know.
[2997.82 → 2998.04] She said,
[2998.12 → 2999.68] all this talk about heaven,
[3000.32 → 3000.90] we've got to learn
[3000.90 → 3001.64] to live here.
[3002.66 → 3002.98] And I said,
[3003.04 → 3003.20] ah,
[3003.26 → 3003.86] it's true,
[3004.42 → 3004.98] but remember
[3004.98 → 3006.16] what C.S. Lewis said?
[3007.12 → 3008.72] If you live for this life,
[3009.40 → 3010.60] you'll miss the next.
[3010.60 → 3012.72] But if you live
[3012.72 → 3013.74] for the life to come,
[3014.42 → 3015.14] you get this one
[3015.14 → 3015.70] thrown in.
[3016.84 → 3017.66] And isn't that true?
[3019.48 → 3020.50] And that's why
[3020.50 → 3023.00] we have this perspective
[3023.00 → 3028.00] that we can carry
[3028.00 → 3028.68] with us now
[3028.68 → 3029.56] already in life
[3029.56 → 3030.40] that there's a city
[3030.40 → 3031.54] coming in a hope
[3031.54 → 3033.48] as Revelation 21 says
[3033.48 → 3035.00] where the dwelling of God
[3035.00 → 3036.24] is with men
[3036.24 → 3036.80] or people
[3036.80 → 3037.88] and he'll live with them.
[3038.58 → 3039.66] They will be his people,
[3039.66 → 3040.54] God himself
[3040.54 → 3041.34] will be with them
[3041.34 → 3042.20] and be their God.
[3042.32 → 3043.34] He'll wipe every tear
[3043.34 → 3044.30] from their eyes.
[3044.76 → 3045.98] There will be no more death
[3045.98 → 3046.56] or mourning
[3046.56 → 3047.34] or crying
[3047.34 → 3048.22] or pain
[3048.22 → 3049.92] for the old order
[3049.92 → 3050.78] of things
[3050.78 → 3053.26] has passed away.
[3054.92 → 3055.80] It may be aging.
[3055.92 → 3056.88] When I was a teenager,
[3057.02 → 3058.36] I didn't give too much thought
[3058.36 → 3059.28] about the future.
[3060.68 → 3061.58] But, you know,
[3061.68 → 3063.34] when you hit 70,
[3063.40 → 3064.24] you start thinking
[3064.24 → 3065.06] about these things.
[3065.16 → 3065.94] You see people
[3065.94 → 3067.22] becoming frail.
[3067.22 → 3068.28] You feel it yourself
[3068.28 → 3069.10] and you realize,
[3069.30 → 3070.72] hey, life isn't forever.
[3072.84 → 3074.22] Ah, yes it is.
[3075.08 → 3075.84] We have a hope
[3075.84 → 3077.02] because of Easter.
[3077.80 → 3079.64] And so we discipline ourselves
[3079.64 → 3080.64] to say,
[3080.92 → 3082.34] I'm going to live
[3082.34 → 3083.14] for my Saviour
[3083.14 → 3084.72] in this life
[3084.72 → 3086.02] knowing there's another.
[3087.22 → 3087.72] Another,
[3087.84 → 3088.98] last advantage
[3088.98 → 3090.16] of Easter
[3090.16 → 3090.90] is that
[3090.90 → 3092.06] you might say
[3092.06 → 3093.30] we have a friendship
[3093.30 → 3094.92] not only with Christ
[3094.92 → 3098.00] but with his community.
[3099.98 → 3101.56] We simply gather here
[3101.56 → 3102.46] because of Easter.
[3104.58 → 3105.06] Really,
[3105.20 → 3105.80] every Sunday
[3105.80 → 3106.58] we should start
[3106.58 → 3107.44] almost the service
[3107.44 → 3107.82] saying,
[3108.18 → 3109.06] Christ is risen.
[3109.38 → 3109.58] You know,
[3109.88 → 3111.12] he is risen indeed.
[3114.70 → 3115.38] Paul in,
[3115.80 → 3116.08] I mean,
[3116.14 → 3116.76] John rather
[3116.76 → 3117.74] in his gospel
[3117.74 → 3119.70] on Easter Sunday
[3119.70 → 3120.86] has these words
[3120.86 → 3121.46] of Jesus
[3121.46 → 3123.08] where he's really
[3123.08 → 3123.72] initiating
[3123.72 → 3124.82] the Christian community
[3124.82 → 3127.12] and he meets them
[3127.12 → 3127.98] in the upper room
[3127.98 → 3128.62] and he says,
[3128.78 → 3129.70] peace be with you.
[3130.10 → 3131.18] Must have been startling.
[3133.14 → 3133.66] Suddenly,
[3133.86 → 3134.94] they're standing there
[3134.94 → 3135.94] and they're afraid
[3135.94 → 3136.74] of the authorities
[3136.74 → 3138.64] and not sure
[3138.64 → 3138.90] of,
[3139.64 → 3139.82] you know,
[3139.88 → 3141.50] they saw an empty grave.
[3141.60 → 3142.10] They didn't know
[3142.10 → 3142.96] what was up yet.
[3142.96 → 3147.26] Mary had seen Jesus
[3147.26 → 3148.92] but not trustworthy
[3148.92 → 3150.44] and not enough anyway
[3150.44 → 3151.50] and there's Jesus.
[3151.66 → 3152.52] Peace be with you.
[3153.58 → 3154.62] As the Father
[3154.62 → 3155.74] has sent me,
[3156.06 → 3157.24] I am sending you
[3157.24 → 3157.86] and with that
[3157.86 → 3159.64] he breathed on them.
[3159.74 → 3161.04] It's like the breath
[3161.04 → 3161.94] of creation
[3161.94 → 3163.72] giving them new life
[3163.72 → 3164.18] and said,
[3164.66 → 3166.80] receive the Holy Spirit,
[3167.00 → 3167.80] his spirit.
[3168.72 → 3170.22] If you forgive anyone
[3170.22 → 3171.10] his sins,
[3171.48 → 3172.44] they are forgiven.
[3172.44 → 3173.76] He's commissioning them.
[3173.86 → 3174.44] He's establishing
[3175.14 → 3176.66] the community of faith
[3176.66 → 3177.24] and he says,
[3177.36 → 3178.52] if you don't forgive them,
[3178.74 → 3179.52] they're not forgiven.
[3179.60 → 3180.08] In other words,
[3180.14 → 3180.86] if somebody's sins
[3180.86 → 3181.56] aren't forgiven,
[3181.80 → 3182.70] well, they're retained.
[3182.88 → 3183.74] They still have them.
[3184.12 → 3185.30] They still need to be
[3185.30 → 3186.32] hearing the gospel.
[3188.16 → 3189.04] But the point is,
[3189.36 → 3191.90] we are now,
[3192.08 → 3193.30] because of Easter,
[3194.62 → 3195.76] a family
[3195.76 → 3199.48] of Christ followers
[3199.48 → 3201.44] who look to him
[3201.44 → 3202.82] as our living Lord.
[3202.82 → 3204.74] And we share
[3204.74 → 3206.46] this Saviour,
[3207.88 → 3209.02] we're a community
[3209.02 → 3209.90] united
[3209.90 → 3212.10] in our resurrected
[3212.10 → 3213.76] Lord Jesus
[3213.76 → 3215.32] who all have had
[3215.32 → 3216.74] our sins forgiven
[3216.74 → 3217.70] and have been given
[3217.70 → 3218.56] this promise
[3218.56 → 3220.16] of new life
[3220.16 → 3221.22] in him.
[3221.22 → 3224.46] and that's why
[3224.46 → 3225.68] Jesus,
[3225.92 → 3227.22] before he leaves,
[3227.56 → 3229.46] he says to his community,
[3229.60 → 3230.36] the disciples,
[3230.68 → 3232.10] surely I'm with you
[3232.10 → 3232.90] always
[3232.90 → 3234.28] to the end
[3234.28 → 3235.12] of the age.
[3236.18 → 3236.40] We're,
[3236.56 → 3237.06] call it,
[3237.26 → 3238.22] forever friends
[3238.22 → 3239.10] with Christ
[3239.10 → 3241.82] and with each other.
[3242.78 → 3243.86] We need to see
[3243.86 → 3244.48] each other
[3244.48 → 3246.00] in that way
[3246.00 → 3248.14] through the eyes
[3248.14 → 3248.88] of Jesus.
[3248.88 → 3253.62] fellow family members,
[3253.74 → 3254.74] brothers and sisters,
[3255.74 → 3256.92] if Jesus
[3256.92 → 3258.10] has not
[3258.10 → 3259.02] been raised,
[3259.14 → 3259.86] we're sitting here
[3259.86 → 3260.46] this morning
[3260.46 → 3262.10] are really the most
[3262.10 → 3262.84] to be pitied
[3262.84 → 3265.44] because really,
[3265.62 → 3265.66] you're,
[3265.84 → 3267.54] you are wasting
[3267.54 → 3268.38] your time,
[3268.50 → 3269.04] you're wasting
[3269.04 → 3269.82] your money.
[3270.26 → 3271.50] If you're like us,
[3271.54 → 3271.92] I don't know,
[3271.98 → 3272.94] I calculated once
[3272.94 → 3273.82] how many thousands
[3273.82 → 3274.44] we spent
[3274.44 → 3275.56] on Christian
[3275.56 → 3276.52] tuition,
[3276.98 → 3278.26] it was a lot
[3278.26 → 3278.62] of money.
[3278.72 → 3279.26] I could have had
[3279.26 → 3280.28] a really nice
[3280.28 → 3282.10] big motor home
[3282.10 → 3282.96] for all that
[3282.96 → 3283.98] and,
[3284.14 → 3284.34] you know,
[3284.52 → 3285.86] you could be out,
[3285.94 → 3286.08] well,
[3286.14 → 3287.06] you wouldn't this morning
[3287.06 → 3288.36] but there's a lot
[3288.36 → 3289.30] of good activities
[3289.30 → 3290.42] to be engaging in
[3290.42 → 3291.44] on a Sunday morning
[3291.44 → 3292.16] and you don't have
[3292.16 → 3292.68] to deal with
[3292.68 → 3293.40] the difficulties
[3293.40 → 3294.22] of living with
[3294.22 → 3295.74] people in the congregation
[3295.74 → 3297.10] you don't exactly like.
[3297.32 → 3298.04] There are all kinds
[3298.04 → 3298.82] of advantages
[3298.82 → 3299.90] of not being
[3299.90 → 3300.50] a Christian
[3300.50 → 3303.52] but Christ
[3303.52 → 3304.48] has been raised.
[3305.88 → 3306.56] He lives
[3306.56 → 3308.64] and we live
[3308.64 → 3309.06] in Him
[3309.06 → 3312.14] and therefore,
[3312.36 → 3313.24] we're the ones
[3313.24 → 3314.68] that need
[3314.68 → 3315.44] to pity them
[3315.44 → 3317.72] because they live
[3317.72 → 3318.46] without hope
[3318.46 → 3320.84] and we don't.
[3323.24 → 3324.30] So let me conclude
[3324.30 → 3325.34] by reminding you
[3325.34 → 3327.42] of the points
[3327.42 → 3328.98] that because
[3328.98 → 3329.70] we belong
[3329.70 → 3330.78] to a resurrected
[3330.78 → 3331.58] and living
[3331.58 → 3332.38] Lord Jesus
[3332.38 → 3335.80] and I guess
[3335.80 → 3336.82] I didn't say that.
[3336.94 → 3337.36] They're all
[3337.36 → 3339.12] words that begin
[3339.12 → 3340.04] with the letter F.
[3340.10 → 3340.72] Our faith
[3340.72 → 3341.64] makes sense.
[3342.58 → 3343.38] We enjoy
[3343.38 → 3344.04] forgiveness
[3344.04 → 3345.40] of sins.
[3346.22 → 3347.14] We face
[3347.14 → 3347.68] death
[3347.68 → 3349.18] and life
[3349.18 → 3350.00] with confidence.
[3351.26 → 3352.08] We have
[3352.08 → 3352.92] an immediate
[3352.92 → 3354.68] and an eternal
[3354.68 → 3355.58] future.
[3355.58 → 3358.12] and we have
[3358.12 → 3358.92] a friend
[3358.92 → 3360.02] in Jesus
[3360.02 → 3362.72] and a family
[3362.72 → 3364.24] of support.
[3365.28 → 3366.16] Pray with me.
[3367.60 → 3368.78] Lord Jesus,
[3368.98 → 3369.84] it is truly
[3369.84 → 3370.58] amazing
[3370.58 → 3371.58] what you
[3371.58 → 3372.72] have accomplished
[3372.72 → 3374.26] for our sake.
[3374.64 → 3375.30] You first
[3375.30 → 3376.14] identified
[3376.14 → 3377.54] with all
[3377.54 → 3378.28] the crud
[3378.28 → 3379.12] of our life.
[3380.16 → 3380.84] You walked
[3380.84 → 3382.06] in the midst
[3382.06 → 3383.34] of our brokenness
[3383.34 → 3385.76] and you
[3385.76 → 3386.36] allowed
[3386.36 → 3387.38] the authorities
[3387.38 → 3388.36] of the day
[3388.36 → 3391.28] to crucify you
[3391.28 → 3393.68] and in so doing
[3393.68 → 3394.84] you exposed them
[3394.84 → 3395.38] for whom
[3395.38 → 3396.44] they were
[3396.44 → 3398.40] but then
[3398.40 → 3399.80] you surprised
[3399.80 → 3400.88] not only
[3400.88 → 3401.64] your followers
[3401.64 → 3402.74] but the world
[3402.74 → 3405.90] by the Father
[3405.90 → 3407.50] raising you up
[3407.50 → 3407.96] again
[3407.96 → 3409.72] from the dead
[3409.72 → 3412.64] and because
[3412.64 → 3413.42] of that
[3413.42 → 3414.94] we live.
[3415.92 → 3416.90] We have hope.
[3417.80 → 3418.44] We have
[3418.44 → 3419.00] forgiveness.
[3420.54 → 3421.52] We can
[3421.52 → 3422.74] not
[3422.74 → 3423.72] fear
[3423.72 → 3424.54] our own
[3424.54 → 3425.00] death.
[3425.92 → 3426.48] In fact,
[3426.64 → 3427.14] we can
[3427.14 → 3428.44] anticipate
[3428.44 → 3429.78] eternity
[3429.78 → 3431.38] with you
[3431.38 → 3433.30] and as
[3433.30 → 3434.02] we wait
[3434.02 → 3435.14] and work
[3435.14 → 3436.60] journeying
[3436.60 → 3437.36] through this
[3437.36 → 3438.08] world
[3438.08 → 3438.96] we can
[3438.96 → 3439.66] do so
[3439.66 → 3440.98] with brothers
[3440.98 → 3441.74] and sisters
[3441.74 → 3443.00] who also
[3443.00 → 3444.50] look to you
[3444.50 → 3445.28] Lord Jesus
[3445.28 → 3446.56] as their
[3446.56 → 3447.00] saviour.
[3449.24 → 3450.24] As we
[3450.24 → 3451.02] anticipate
[3451.02 → 3452.50] our future
[3452.50 → 3453.24] oh God
[3453.24 → 3455.12] find us
[3455.12 → 3456.10] faithful
[3456.10 → 3457.92] establish
[3457.92 → 3459.24] our hope
[3459.24 → 3461.64] and expand
[3461.64 → 3462.38] our love
[3462.38 → 3462.98] for you
[3462.98 → 3464.32] and for one
[3464.32 → 3464.74] another
[3464.74 → 3465.98] and we pray
[3465.98 → 3466.78] in Christ's
[3466.78 → 3467.02] name
[3467.02 → 3468.16] amen.
[3472.54 → 3473.32] Christ the
[3473.32 → 3473.78] Lord is
[3473.78 → 3474.54] risen today.
[3474.70 → 3474.94] We'll
[3474.94 → 3476.44] stand it
[3476.44 → 3476.94] when we're
[3476.94 → 3477.64] ready to
[3477.64 → 3478.14] sing it.
[3478.14 → 3479.14] Amen.
[3497.68 → 3499.18] praise God
[3499.18 → 3499.34] we're
[3499.34 → 3499.38] simply
[3499.38 → 3499.48] so
[3499.48 → 3499.64] hy��니다
[3499.64 → 3504.36] and hug
[3504.36 → 3505.48] hallelujah
[3505.48 → 3508.22] all creation
[3508.22 → 3509.62] joined to
[3509.62 → 3510.42] د
[3510.42 → 3512.70] hallelujah
[3512.70 → 3518.74] Alleluia, praise your joys and triumphs, Lord.
[3521.24 → 3527.48] Alleluia, sing all the heavens and earth, we bow.
[3527.48 → 3531.84] Alleluia.
[3531.84 → 3561.82] Alleluia, sing all the heavens and earth, we bow.
[3561.84 → 3570.84] Christ has opened paradise, alleluia.
[3574.84 → 3583.84] He is again, alleluia, speaking all the heavens and earth, we bow.
[3583.84 → 3592.76] Where our death is now your sting, alleluia.
[3592.84 → 3600.84] Once he died, our souls to sin, alleluia.
[3600.84 → 3609.84] Where our victory obey, alleluia.
[3609.84 → 3623.84] So we know where Christ has led, alleluia.
[3623.84 → 3633.84] Falling our exalted head, alleluia.
[3634.84 → 3642.84] And like him, like him, we rise, alleluia.
[3642.84 → 3647.84] Rise the cross that gave us, God.
[3647.84 → 3649.84] Alleluia.
[3649.84 → 3651.84] Alleluia.
[3651.84 → 3652.84] Alleluia.
[3652.84 → 3654.84] Alleluia.
[3654.84 → 3665.84] At this point I'd like to invite the deacons up to take this morning's offering, which
[3665.84 → 3669.84] which is for denominational shares, as you can read behind me there.
[3670.24 → 3674.58] It's a ministry that supports mission and ministry all over the world,
[3674.70 → 3676.32], so please give as you are able.
[3695.84 → 3697.84] Amen.
[3725.84 → 3727.84] Amen.
[3755.84 → 3757.84] Amen.
[3785.84 → 3787.84] Amen.
[3815.84 → 3829.68] Let us come before the Lord our God in this time of congregational prayer.
[3832.58 → 3835.32] You, O Lord, are mighty to eternity.
[3836.06 → 3837.08] You are the risen King.
[3837.46 → 3838.62] You are mighty to save.
[3839.30 → 3841.54] We exalt and glorify you this morning.
[3842.36 → 3847.10] Almighty God, you stepped down from heaven and walked the earth alongside us,
[3847.46 → 3851.62] and for our salvation gave yourself over to death on the cross.
[3852.86 → 3854.84] But death could not hold you.
[3855.72 → 3859.96] You conquered the grave and paid the debt of our many sins,
[3860.32 → 3863.54] and through the resurrection we may come to eternal life.
[3864.64 → 3868.28] Jesus, truly, you are the Son of God.
[3868.28 → 3873.48] May we be compelled to sing your praises from the depths of our souls,
[3874.04 → 3875.70] for you alone are worthy.
[3877.04 → 3880.88] As we come into mid-spring, the flowers of the field seem to burst forth from nothing,
[3881.22 → 3884.36] the river swells with water, fresh from the mountains,
[3884.70 → 3887.10] and the songs of the birds fill the morning sky.
[3887.82 → 3889.94] The whole earth is alive with your glory,
[3890.50 → 3894.58] and we stand in awesome wonder before the works your hands have made.
[3894.58 → 3898.92] We thank you, Lord, for Canada, for this community in Ladder,
[3899.30 → 3900.96] and for this congregation of believers.
[3901.58 → 3903.32] For Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy,
[3903.42 → 3905.70] who have diligently and faithfully led this congregation,
[3906.28 → 3907.58] instructing us in your ways,
[3908.48 → 3911.48] and spreading the gospel in a manner worthy of your name.
[3912.54 → 3914.68] It is our privilege to be called followers,
[3914.88 → 3917.20] indeed children of the one true living God.
[3918.04 → 3919.30] We pray for this church,
[3919.76 → 3921.56] guide our work through your Holy Spirit,
[3921.56 → 3925.42] turn our hearts towards love, joy, peace,
[3925.98 → 3927.96] patience, kindness, generosity,
[3928.58 → 3931.24] faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[3931.90 → 3935.12] May we always hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[3935.72 → 3938.36] as this is what Jesus asks of his disciples.
[3939.24 → 3942.46] May we be deeply pained when we see or hear of oppression,
[3942.84 → 3946.50] or violence, or suffering, or neglect, or cruelty, or wickedness.
[3946.50 → 3950.04] Help us become advocates for those who,
[3950.78 → 3952.94] and the well-being for those who are oppressed.
[3953.36 → 3957.36] Give us courage and energy and desire to confront evil,
[3957.78 → 3961.00] and to do our part, however small, to make it right.
[3961.72 → 3964.58] On our own, Lord, this task is impossible.
[3965.68 → 3968.72] But with God, all things are possible.
[3969.80 → 3972.46] May we as your children be vessels of your goodness,
[3972.84 → 3974.62] and channels of your peace.
[3974.62 → 3978.32] Lord, we rejoice at the news
[3978.32 → 3981.18] that Jordan's cancer treatment has been a success.
[3981.92 → 3983.62] There still may be tough days ahead,
[3983.86 → 3986.04] but we hope and pray that this terrible disease
[3986.04 → 3988.28] is ridden from his body forever.
[3989.52 → 3991.14] But Lord, there are many in this congregation
[3991.14 → 3992.36] that are suffering still,
[3992.74 → 3994.00] with serious health issues,
[3994.40 → 3996.54] and this morning we lift and pray for Pat,
[3997.24 → 3999.32] for John, who still remains in hospital,
[3999.84 → 4002.58] for Amy, for Nancy, and Eileen.
[4002.58 → 4005.28] We pray, too, for Vic and Lori,
[4005.48 → 4007.24] as they grieve the loss of Lori's mom.
[4008.50 → 4010.18] Be near to those who are too sick,
[4010.40 → 4012.10] or too frail to attend church,
[4012.58 → 4014.64] and bring them comfort wherever they are.
[4015.88 → 4018.46] While we may not know of all the hurt in this world, Lord,
[4019.02 → 4020.58] you know each one of us,
[4020.92 → 4022.44] and you suffer alongside us.
[4023.28 → 4025.30] Be with all those who suffer the endless battle
[4025.30 → 4026.56] against lifelong illnesses,
[4026.94 → 4029.06] for those struggling against daily pain,
[4029.06 → 4030.32] and chronic health issues,
[4030.76 → 4032.36] for those suffering with mental illness,
[4032.80 → 4035.96] with depression, addiction, with loneliness,
[4036.76 → 4039.18] for those grieving the loss of a loved one,
[4040.02 → 4043.24] for those among us facing the daily effects of old age.
[4044.28 → 4046.18] Lord, come quickly.
[4047.28 → 4050.50] We long for a day of a new heaven and a new earth,
[4050.76 → 4052.92] where every tear is wiped from our eyes,
[4052.92 → 4054.50] and there will be no more death,
[4054.76 → 4055.30] or mourning,
[4055.88 → 4056.54] or crying,
[4057.38 → 4057.90] or pain.
[4058.74 → 4061.40] Lord, give us everything we stand and need us of,
[4061.78 → 4063.64] and guard us against everything we don't.
[4064.38 → 4065.62] May your kingdom come,
[4065.82 → 4066.82] and your will be done.
[4067.36 → 4068.76] We pray this all in Jesus' name.
[4069.34 → 4069.54] Amen.
[4071.48 → 4074.28] At this point, I'd like to invite Pastor Bill back up
[4074.28 → 4076.40] to bring us God's parting blessing.
[4076.40 → 4076.52] Amen.
[4076.52 → 4076.56] Amen.
[4082.92 → 4087.32] I think there's another song there too, right?
[4087.62 → 4088.18] Yeah, yeah.
[4088.32 → 4093.64] Well, thank you for allowing me the privilege
[4093.64 → 4096.42] to speak God's word,
[4096.62 → 4099.36] to bring the gospel to you this morning,
[4099.78 → 4101.60] as you go from here.
[4102.92 → 4108.54] Go in the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus.
[4108.82 → 4111.52] You know, Paul in Ephesians 1 talks about that,
[4111.52 → 4116.40] and how much he prays that we may know how much power we have.
[4116.46 → 4120.58] And then he says it's the power that God displayed
[4120.58 → 4122.50] when he raised Jesus from the dead.
[4123.56 → 4123.96] Wow.
[4124.92 → 4130.70] So go in the strength and the presence of Christ,
[4131.12 → 4133.60] who longs to go with you and bless you.
[4133.60 → 4135.58] And the Lord bless you and keep you.
[4135.96 → 4139.18] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4139.18 → 4141.60] The Lord turn his face in your direction
[4141.60 → 4145.52] and give you his joy and his power and his peace
[4145.52 → 4148.56] now and always, to which we God's people say,
[4149.14 → 4149.42] Amen.
[4149.42 → 4154.30] My friends, be your hope and grace,
[4154.30 → 4163.48] and the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour.
[4163.48 → 4171.40] My friends, may you grow in grace
[4171.40 → 4176.84] And in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour
[4176.84 → 4184.46] My friends, may you grow in grace
[4184.46 → 4190.40] And in the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[4190.40 → 4198.16] To God be the glory, now and forever
[4198.16 → 4203.26] Now and forever, amen
[4203.26 → 4211.98] To God be the glory, now and forever
[4211.98 → 4217.28] Now and forever, amen
[4220.40 → 4250.38] To God be the glory, now and forever
[4250.38 → 4280.36] Now and forever, amen
[4280.36 → 4282.36] you
