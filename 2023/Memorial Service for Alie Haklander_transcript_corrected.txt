[600.00 → 601.54] You may be seated.
[608.22 → 609.08] Good morning.
[610.44 → 616.34] On behalf of the family, welcome and thank you for gathering with us today.
[617.04 → 620.28] For those of you who do not know me, my name is Jason True.
[620.38 → 626.60] I am the pastor here, and it has been my honour and privilege to be Allie's pastor for these
[626.60 → 627.54] last few years.
[627.54 → 636.42] So we are here this morning to praise and to thank God for the life of our dear friend
[636.42 → 638.44] and sister in Christ, Allie Hack lander.
[638.98 → 645.76] And we're here to take comfort in the victory of the Lord Jesus Christ over sin and death.
[647.00 → 654.34] And so we are here this morning to remember Allie, but primarily we're here to give thanks
[654.34 → 658.22] to God for blessing us to God for blessing us with Allie.
[661.02 → 669.86] So in this time, we're going to be praying together.
[669.86 → 672.02] We're going to be singing together.
[672.02 → 675.70] We're going to be hearing God's word together.
[676.54 → 682.34] But all of these things that we're going to do are meant to aid us in giving thanks to God
[682.34 → 687.94] as we remember, and we honour Allie's life and what she meant to each one of us here.
[687.94 → 692.14] So as we begin, would you please join me in prayer?
[693.66 → 694.66] Let's pray together.
[694.66 → 704.96] Heavenly Father, Father full of mercy, you are a God abounding with goodness and love.
[705.78 → 708.72] You know how to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted.
[709.60 → 715.62] You are the God who hears our cries and draws near to us in our sadness and our sorrow.
[715.62 → 722.80] Oh God, we thank you for the promise and for the sure hope and the resurrection of the dead
[722.80 → 724.26] and the life everlasting.
[724.94 → 731.32] You have assured us of this great promise through the life, the death, and the resurrection of your son,
[731.42 → 736.22] Jesus Christ, our Saviour, our Redeemer, and the shepherd of our souls.
[736.92 → 741.54] And we ask, oh Lord, by your Holy Spirit, the spirit of peace and comfort,
[741.54 → 749.74] that you would meet us and be with us in this time of worship as we remember and give thanks to you, oh God,
[750.24 → 754.42] for your servant and our sister in Christ, Allie Hack lander.
[754.96 → 762.54] Would you, oh God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, receive all honour and glory through our praises and our prayers,
[763.08 → 765.54] through our remembrances and through our worship,
[766.26 → 771.12] and all for your glory and the sake of your son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[771.54 → 773.82] We pray in his name. Amen.
[777.02 → 780.52] And so we'll have a few scripture readings this morning,
[780.52 → 782.64] and these are chosen by the family
[782.64 → 788.70] because they are the same passages that were read at the memorial service of Allie's husband, John.
[789.24 → 794.46] If you would like, you may follow along in your pew Bible, the brown one in front of you,
[794.46 → 797.62] or you can simply listen as I read for us.
[798.74 → 802.82] You can find the readings there in your order of worship in your program.
[803.58 → 806.74] And so the first one is Psalm 28, verse 7.
[809.24 → 812.18] Psalm 28, verse 7, that's on page 412.
[812.94 → 815.36] And that's just to get you started, but I'll just read along.
[815.36 → 819.46] Psalm 28, verse 7.
[821.40 → 825.48] The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[826.18 → 830.04] My heart trusts in him, and I am helped.
[830.90 → 835.70] My heart leaps for joy, and I will give thanks to him in song.
[835.70 → 847.00] Now Psalm 103, verses 13 to 18.
[849.52 → 852.64] As a father has compassion on his children,
[853.42 → 857.28] so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[858.20 → 860.74] For he knows how we are formed.
[861.54 → 863.64] He remembers that we are dust.
[863.64 → 866.90] As for man, his days are like grass.
[867.46 → 870.90] He flourishes like a flower of the field.
[871.70 → 874.50] The wind blows over it, and it is gone.
[875.04 → 877.22] And its place remembers it no more.
[878.02 → 880.20] But from everlasting to everlasting,
[880.88 → 883.42] the Lord's love is with those who fear him,
[883.98 → 887.36] and his righteousness with their children's children,
[887.88 → 889.54] with those who keep his covenant
[889.54 → 893.22] and remember to obey his precepts.
[893.64 → 899.88] Then we will read from Psalm 121.
[899.88 → 900.88] Psalm 131.
[906.70 → 909.32] I lift my eyes to the hills.
[909.84 → 911.62] From where does my help come?
[912.54 → 914.34] My help comes from the Lord,
[914.94 → 916.70] the maker of heaven and earth.
[917.68 → 919.40] He will not let your foot slip.
[920.60 → 922.88] He who watches over you will not slumber.
[923.80 → 926.42] Indeed, he who watches over Israel
[926.42 → 929.32] will neither slumber nor sleep.
[930.24 → 932.14] The Lord watches over you.
[932.54 → 934.88] The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[935.64 → 937.70] The sun will not harm you by day,
[937.74 → 939.24] nor the moon by night.
[939.96 → 942.66] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[943.42 → 945.68] He will watch over your life.
[945.68 → 949.90] The Lord will watch over your coming and going,
[950.58 → 953.02] both now and forevermore.
[953.02 → 959.36] Then one more, Psalm 139,
[960.08 → 963.26] verses 1 through 18, and then 23 and 24.
[964.24 → 965.26] Psalm 139.
[965.26 → 970.02] O Lord, you have searched me and you know me.
[970.84 → 973.36] You know when I sit and when I rise.
[974.14 → 976.16] You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[977.50 → 980.74] You discern my going out and my lying down.
[981.60 → 983.40] You are familiar with all my ways.
[984.64 → 986.20] Before a word is on my tongue,
[986.30 → 987.72] you know it completely, O Lord.
[988.74 → 991.46] You hem me in, behind and before.
[991.46 → 994.04] You have laid your hand upon me.
[994.82 → 997.00] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
[997.12 → 998.58] too lofty for me to attain.
[999.78 → 1001.44] Where can I go from your spirit?
[1002.34 → 1004.10] Where can I flee from your presence?
[1005.12 → 1007.10] If I go up to the heavens, you are there.
[1007.76 → 1010.50] If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
[1011.40 → 1013.44] If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
[1013.74 → 1016.10] if I settle on the far side of the sea,
[1016.78 → 1018.80] even there your hand will guide me.
[1018.80 → 1021.26] Your right hand will hold me fast.
[1022.16 → 1025.28] If I say, surely the darkness will hide me
[1025.28 → 1027.74] and the light become night around me,
[1028.44 → 1030.76] even the darkness will not be dark to you.
[1031.46 → 1033.22] The night will shine like the day,
[1033.72 → 1035.72] for darkness is as light to you.
[1037.04 → 1039.16] For you created my inmost being.
[1040.00 → 1042.26] You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[1043.12 → 1046.20] I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1046.66 → 1048.18] Your works are wonderful.
[1048.34 → 1049.58] I know that full well.
[1049.58 → 1052.48] My frame was not hidden from you
[1052.48 → 1054.72] when I was made in the secret place,
[1055.00 → 1057.36] when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
[1058.00 → 1060.12] Your eyes saw my unformed body.
[1060.94 → 1062.58] All the days ordained for me
[1062.58 → 1064.34] were written in your book
[1064.34 → 1066.50] before one of them came to be.
[1067.68 → 1070.28] How precious to me are your thoughts, O God.
[1070.68 → 1072.64] How vast is the sum of them.
[1073.54 → 1074.52] Were I to count them,
[1074.52 → 1077.56] they would outnumber the grains of sand.
[1080.48 → 1081.88] Search me, O God,
[1082.58 → 1083.68] and know my heart.
[1084.68 → 1085.30] Test me
[1085.30 → 1087.60] and know my anxious thoughts.
[1088.48 → 1091.36] See if there is any offensive way in me
[1091.36 → 1093.24] and lead me
[1093.24 → 1095.28] in the way everlasting.
[1095.28 → 1097.58] This is the reading of God's word.
[1099.68 → 1101.88] And so we will be singing
[1101.88 → 1104.72] some of the hymns of the church
[1104.72 → 1106.48] that Ali loved to sing so much.
[1107.12 → 1109.74] And we are also going low-tech.
[1110.14 → 1112.04] We will not be having words on the screen.
[1112.18 → 1112.90] We will be singing
[1112.90 → 1114.80] out of our gray psalter hymnals.
[1115.06 → 1116.26] And you can find those.
[1117.02 → 1117.88] Hopefully you'll have them
[1117.88 → 1119.30] on your front pew
[1119.30 → 1120.30] and you can share.
[1120.30 → 1122.56] So we'll first be singing
[1122.56 → 1123.56] two songs
[1123.56 → 1124.60] along with the organ.
[1125.88 → 1126.88] Abide with me.
[1127.60 → 1129.14] And I heard the voice of Jesus say.
[1129.40 → 1131.08] And so you need to follow along
[1131.08 → 1132.54] in your bulletin
[1132.54 → 1135.54] where the psalm number is listed.
[1135.78 → 1137.22] Psalm 442.
[1137.68 → 1138.66] That's not the page number.
[1138.82 → 1139.64] It's the psalm number.
[1139.86 → 1140.52] Psalm 442.
[1141.38 → 1142.78] And we will be reading
[1142.78 → 1143.70] or singing then
[1143.70 → 1146.74] verses 1, 2, 4, and 5.
[1147.94 → 1148.94] And then when we are done
[1148.94 → 1149.64] singing that song,
[1149.64 → 1151.10] we'll turn to the next song
[1151.10 → 1154.30] which is Psalm 488
[1154.30 → 1155.38] verses 1, 2, and 3.
[1155.84 → 1156.90] Okay, so let's all rise.
[1158.00 → 1159.26] It will give you a little time
[1159.26 → 1161.96] to turn in your psalter hymnal.
[1162.82 → 1165.40] But we will sing along.
[1165.40 → 1165.64] Amen.
[1165.76 → 1166.00] Amen.
[1166.00 → 1167.00] Amen.
[1196.00 → 1198.00] Amen.
[1226.00 → 1228.00] Amen.
[1256.00 → 1258.00] Amen.
[1286.00 → 1288.00] Amen.
[1316.00 → 1318.00] Amen.
[1346.00 → 1348.00] Amen.
[1376.00 → 1378.00] Amen.
[1406.00 → 1408.00] Amen.
[1436.00 → 1438.00] Amen.
[1466.00 → 1468.00] Amen.
[1496.00 → 1498.00] Amen.
[1526.00 → 1528.00] Amen.
[1556.00 → 1558.00] Amen.
[1582.00 → 1582.04] Amen.
[1582.04 → 1592.50] So I want to invite Joe Chalk up, and he will share thoughts of Ali, our dear sister in Christ.
[1612.04 → 1626.92] I really think we need to thank Mel for playing some old Dutch hymns that Ali loved so much prior to the service starting. Thank you, Mel.
[1626.92 → 1641.68] On behalf of Ali's family, I would like to thank all of you for being here this morning in what we can truly say is a celebration of a long, well-lived life.
[1642.04 → 1655.04] The family also wishes to sincerely thank all who came alongside them in their difficult moments when their mother and grandmother was so ill prior to her passing,
[1655.04 → 1662.04] and for your love and support in so many ways that they now experience in their grief.
[1662.04 → 1674.04] I would also like to welcome and thank all who were not able to join us this morning in person, but welcome you via livestream.
[1674.04 → 1679.04] Your presence is felt and much appreciated.
[1679.04 → 1684.04] A special welcome to any Dutch extended family who are viewing this.
[1684.04 → 1686.04] Hatteras Welkom.
[1686.04 → 1696.04] We Benny ZO dank bar that de families in Nederland met bonsais memorial me ma hamate en below.
[1696.04 → 1708.04] My name is Joe Chalk, a good friend and regular visitor with Ali and John and a fellow member of this congregation.
[1708.04 → 1715.04] I feel honoured to have been asked by the family to share a few thoughts and memories of Ali with you.
[1715.04 → 1718.04] This is something she would not have planned.
[1718.04 → 1727.04] Ali, had she been asked, more likely than not would have looked down, shook her head no, and said,
[1727.04 → 1730.04] that's not necessary.
[1730.04 → 1745.04] The family, through me, are doing this to honour a most loved, cherished, selfless lady who is a privilege to know and have had in our lives.
[1745.04 → 1761.04] Alisha Ali Hack lander, named Misshapen, was born on October 16th, 1925 in Neutered, say it right, in Gelderland, the Netherlands,
[1761.04 → 1767.04] where she and her four siblings were raised on a small family farm.
[1767.04 → 1778.04] At age 14, all children stopped going to school and Ali went to work, cleaning homes and caring for young children.
[1778.04 → 1790.04] Her teenage years were difficult, World War II years, and Ali saw much destruction, deprivation and poverty.
[1790.04 → 1802.04] Ali vividly recalled people, families, lined up at the front of her home, looking for leftovers at supper time.
[1802.04 → 1812.04] She and her older sister, Mini, spent a lot of time together, and after the war, it was through Mini that Ali met Jan Hack lander,
[1812.04 → 1819.04] a stranger and a foreigner from just the village close by.
[1819.04 → 1832.04] They were married in 1948, and then in 1952, Run, Ali, and little daughter, Jerry, immigrated to Canada,
[1832.04 → 1838.04] following other extended family members that were already here.
[1838.04 → 1845.04] The Hack landers came to settle here in Ladder. Run soon found gainful employment,
[1845.04 → 1850.04] and I'll call him Run and John as we go through.
[1850.04 → 1862.04] And Ali described her and child Jerry, along with sister Mini and little son Henry, as well as Wilma, now Van Tall, and her mother.
[1862.04 → 1871.04] They picked potatoes in farmers' fields in the fall for the sum of 25 cents an hour.
[1871.04 → 1877.04] This was, of course, done to help with family income and be able to make a go of it here in Canada,
[1877.04 → 1890.04] having arrived from Holland with little more than a few clothes, some family household items, and very little, if any, money.
[1890.04 → 1901.04] Saving became important in their way of living, as Ali and John were convinced that buying and owning their own home versus renting
[1901.04 → 1910.04] was absolutely the only way to live in their new adopted country.
[1910.04 → 1924.04] The edict was, you should buy, and that was passed on to the children and grandchildren, and is even that set in their minds today.
[1924.04 → 1936.04] John eventually built Ali and family a brand new big house, a bungalow all maybe a thousand square feet on 53rd Street.
[1936.04 → 1944.04] And that family, which now also included son Alan, moved in January 1962.
[1944.04 → 1957.04] Within weeks, Bill was born in a Vancouver hospital, and Ali remembered that John had driven into Vancouver in deep snow,
[1957.04 → 1964.04] complete with chains on tires, to pick up Ali and baby and bring them home safely.
[1964.04 → 1969.04] Ali was always happiest at home.
[1969.04 → 1976.04] Cleaning, washing, cleaning, cooking, cleaning, you get the picture.
[1976.04 → 1982.04] And always doing everywhere, going everywhere on her trusty bicycle.
[1982.04 → 1990.04] That's how she went into town, did her grocery shopping, went to visit, did whatever she needed to do or go.
[1990.04 → 1998.04] She often explained, I couldn't drive, didn't like it, couldn't do it, and besides, didn't need it.
[1998.04 → 2002.04] She said, I had my bicycle.
[2002.04 → 2013.04] She not so recently related that one of her Saturdays in later life was that, when John suggested, at age 86 I believe,
[2013.04 → 2017.04] that she shouldn't be riding a bike anymore.
[2017.04 → 2025.04] It was getting too dangerous, too much traffic, her age, and look what happened to so-and-so recently.
[2025.04 → 2032.04] She promptly told John, then, sell that bike, and I'll walk from now on.
[2032.04 → 2038.04] And she continued to do that until she was probably about 95 years old.
[2038.04 → 2052.04] John and Ali were sincere, caring, hardworking, fairly simple, nothing extravagant, family the most important thing in their lives, type of people.
[2052.04 → 2056.04] They reached out to many people in this community in a variety of ways.
[2056.04 → 2070.04] How many here were recipients of eggs that the Hack liners drove to Abbotsford to get direct from the chicken farm, delivered to so many of us on a monthly basis?
[2070.04 → 2074.04] Eggs were even bartered for potatoes and other goods.
[2074.04 → 2081.04] Gifts of furniture and wood artifacts, handmade in John's workshop, were treasured.
[2081.04 → 2091.04] Or, Ali making soup and sandwiches for Jan and other volunteers who were just down the street building the new Delta Christian School.
[2091.04 → 2098.04] John and Ali were generous in their church and Christian school communities.
[2098.04 → 2112.04] Oh, they travelled some, to visit family in the Netherlands a few times, and once to John's brother and family in Australia.
[2112.04 → 2121.04] But, Ali was happiest, right here in Ladder, in her home on 53rd Street.
[2121.04 → 2130.04] I've mentioned John often in his eulogy, but he was Ali's life for so much and for so long.
[2130.04 → 2135.04] And when you speak of one, you're speaking of both of them.
[2135.04 → 2145.04] Following John's passing in 2016, after 67 years of marriage, Ali soldiered on.
[2145.04 → 2154.04] On her own, determined to live life independently, never wavering in her strength and determination,
[2154.04 → 2160.04] always doing her quick step walk whenever and wherever she went.
[2160.04 → 2162.04] And we all remember that.
[2162.04 → 2176.04] Jerry, how many times was Mum always in a hurry, exiting your vehicle while it was still moving in the Save On Foods parking lot,
[2176.04 → 2180.04] during your weekly shopping expedition with her?
[2180.04 → 2189.04] Ali complained very little, maybe the odd time of back pain or right hand and fingers that didn't work so good anymore.
[2189.04 → 2195.04] Of course, she had a hearing issue, but you just carry on.
[2195.04 → 2197.04] And that was her attitude.
[2197.04 → 2203.04] Yes, she admitted to being lonely sometimes, especially evenings and nights.
[2203.04 → 2211.04] She could and would watch the Canucks, but only if the Canucks were winning.
[2211.04 → 2213.04] Even a tie.
[2213.04 → 2221.04] She often turned it out because she was too nervous, winning, nervous otherwise.
[2221.04 → 2227.04] She continued to live life with vigour and perseverance.
[2227.04 → 2237.04] Ali's gardens were big, carefully planned, and planted, always weeded and tended to, and always plentiful.
[2237.04 → 2249.04] Freezers and shelves were always plump full of frozen canned vegetables and fruit from plentiful gardens and numerous fruit trees on a large 53rd Street property.
[2249.04 → 2259.04] At age 90, arriving for a short visit, I begged Ali to get down off that ladder under the plum tree and said,
[2259.04 → 2262.04] Please, don't do that anymore.
[2262.04 → 2268.04] Only to be gently rebuffed with, I can still do that.
[2268.04 → 2275.04] Fruit on many trees meant joyfully sharing with most of the family, friends and neighbours.
[2275.04 → 2283.04] Ali's BOU de Cole, which is kale, was the very best, the cleanest and usually already cut up for you.
[2283.04 → 2285.04] She enjoyed cooking.
[2285.04 → 2292.04] It would be considered old style, maybe Dutch style, meat, potatoes, vegetables.
[2292.04 → 2306.04] She dutifully and gladly cooked for herself every day until she moved into Augustine House in March of this year, even at 97 plus years old.
[2306.04 → 2311.04] Ali enjoyed her place at Augustine House.
[2311.04 → 2318.04] Of course, it was not her home and not what she was used to.
[2318.04 → 2322.04] But she understood it was the right place for her to be.
[2322.04 → 2326.04] Her biggest worry and concern mentioned often was that,
[2326.04 → 2332.04] I don't want to be a burden to my family or anyone.
[2332.04 → 2340.04] And Dorothy, her next door neighbour, was someone she could count on if she was in a pinch or needed quick help,
[2340.04 → 2347.04] even tending to her in a deep sleep when she accidentally set off her lifeline monitor.
[2347.04 → 2357.04] Pat also became that close friend that she could count on for visits, for help, for rides, for sharing.
[2357.04 → 2361.04] Ali made friends at Augustine House as well.
[2361.04 → 2365.04] Was treated well and was liked by the dining room and the cleaning staff.
[2365.04 → 2370.04] Who said that she, who she said,
[2370.04 → 2375.04] they can vacuum, but I do the dusting myself.
[2375.04 → 2377.04] I still have to do something.
[2377.04 → 2383.04] If Ali had a complaint, it was that the meals were just not her own cooking.
[2383.04 → 2385.04] Meat and potatoes.
[2385.04 → 2390.04] She even started a new lunch protocol for those at her table and a few others.
[2390.04 → 2395.04] Ali didn't care much for many of the soups at lunchtime.
[2395.04 → 2397.04] Too much pepper.
[2397.04 → 2399.04] I don't like pepper.
[2399.04 → 2400.04] Too spicy.
[2400.04 → 2403.04] Never had pepper in my house.
[2403.04 → 2410.04] Or the sandwich selection, all of which looked great to most of us looking at the menu.
[2410.04 → 2416.04] So, she ordered and got what she had every day in her own home.
[2416.04 → 2419.04] A cheese sandwich.
[2419.04 → 2426.04] Ali and others were happy with just ordinary cheese for lunch sandwiches.
[2426.04 → 2430.04] Ali was a thoughtful and caring person.
[2430.04 → 2434.04] Maybe sometimes too reluctant to share her thoughts with others.
[2434.04 → 2441.04] And maybe a little shy about showing her affection.
[2441.04 → 2444.04] She didn't often share a hug.
[2444.04 → 2449.04] But if I offered to give her a hug, she would always thank me for it.
[2449.04 → 2454.04] She relished the love of her special young friend, Sarah, that she met.
[2454.04 → 2457.04] She was a cat sitting in her church bench.
[2457.04 → 2469.04] And that special relationship blossomed over many years.
[2469.04 → 2477.04] She often cared, deeply about family, friends, fellow church parishioners and neighbours.
[2477.04 → 2481.04] She seldom shared her feelings or thoughts about others.
[2481.04 → 2486.04] And when voiced in private, we're left at, but that is their business.
[2486.04 → 2488.04] That's not my business.
[2488.04 → 2492.04] Or that's now their problem.
[2492.04 → 2495.04] Ali had a great sense of humour.
[2495.04 → 2500.04] Often herself the author of some very dry humour or creeps.
[2500.04 → 2502.04] Often coming out of nowhere.
[2502.04 → 2506.04] She was always a delight to visit with.
[2506.04 → 2510.04] Listen, coffee is 10 o'clock.
[2510.04 → 2512.04] I have it ready.
[2512.04 → 2514.04] Which meant, don't be late.
[2514.04 → 2518.04] And if you did show up at say 10, 15.
[2518.04 → 2525.04] She'd already had one cup of coffee, and now she was waiting for you to have your cup with her second.
[2525.04 → 2531.04] And you always have to have a chukka with the coffee.
[2531.04 → 2533.04] Yes, for her birthday.
[2533.04 → 2535.04] Be there on time.
[2535.04 → 2542.04] And be ready to have a must piece of cake covered in whipped cream and fruit.
[2542.04 → 2548.04] Even if you said no thanks, you still were served a piece of cake.
[2548.04 → 2550.04] Because you need it.
[2550.04 → 2555.04] Ali lived more than a full life.
[2555.04 → 2557.04] 98 plus years.
[2557.04 → 2561.04] With no real significant medical or health issues.
[2561.04 → 2565.04] Until her last five weeks or so of her life.
[2565.04 → 2567.04] She relished being so mobile.
[2567.04 → 2569.04] I don't use a walker.
[2569.04 → 2571.04] I don't need one.
[2571.04 → 2572.04] She would continue.
[2572.04 → 2578.04] Almost everyone, younger than me, have a walker at the home here.
[2578.04 → 2585.04] She was the oldest, second-oldest member, sorry, of our church congregation.
[2585.04 → 2589.04] And she often wondered if she would ever become the oldest.
[2589.04 → 2597.04] And in the last couple of years, talked occasionally about, maybe I will get a hundred.
[2597.04 → 2604.04] But, one day at a time is what I do.
[2604.04 → 2613.04] Ali, if she had a restless night or short sleep night, would occasionally mention, I'm not allowed to worry.
[2613.04 → 2616.04] The Bible says we may not worry.
[2616.04 → 2619.04] I have to stop that.
[2619.04 → 2622.04] A little assurance that worry was a natural human trait.
[2622.04 → 2625.04] And that prayer would often help.
[2625.04 → 2628.04] She gave that assured response.
[2628.04 → 2630.04] That's what I try.
[2630.04 → 2636.04] During her final weeks, Ali experienced a lot of pain and discomfort.
[2636.04 → 2639.04] But she had a tremendous will to continue to live.
[2639.04 → 2646.04] I often visited with Ali over those last several weeks.
[2646.04 → 2651.04] I continued to be amazed at her resilience and her willpower.
[2651.04 → 2664.04] During her last week, Ali verbalized that she was completely at peace, knowing that she was going to meet her Saviour and live with him in eternity.
[2664.04 → 2677.04] Over the last number of years, after a visit, I would leave with a traditional Dutch goodbye, tot liens.
[2677.04 → 2683.04] Which, when translated means, till we see each other again.
[2683.04 → 2693.04] Ali had said that she didn't really like goodbye, which to her seemed to be a rather cold way of leaving each other.
[2693.04 → 2699.04] I said tot liens every time I left her in the hospital or hospice bed.
[2699.04 → 2711.04] One of the last times when she could still communicate, we assured each other that tot liens would either be here on earth or in the heavenly realm.
[2711.04 → 2718.04] Today, I hope that we can all say tot liens, Ali.
[2718.04 → 2739.04] Thank you, Joe, for all of those memories that you shared with us.
[2739.04 → 2745.04] So here's a reading from the book of Revelation.
[2745.04 → 2749.04] Chapter 21, I'll read verses 1 through 6.
[2749.04 → 2752.04] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[2752.04 → 2758.04] For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
[2758.04 → 2768.04] I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
[2768.04 → 2773.04] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[2773.04 → 2784.04] Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
[2784.04 → 2787.04] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[2787.04 → 2796.04] There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.
[2796.04 → 2801.04] He who is seated on the throne said, I am making everything new.
[2801.04 → 2808.04] Then he said, write down, write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.
[2808.04 → 2810.04] He said to me, it is done.
[2810.04 → 2815.04] I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[2815.04 → 2823.04] To him who is thirsty, I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.
[2823.04 → 2830.04] Let's stand, and we'll sing our next hymn, By the Sea of Crystal.
[2830.04 → 2836.04] Psalm, hymn number 620, verses 1, 2, and 3. Please rise.
[2853.04 → 2856.04] The sea of Crystal.
[2856.04 → 2858.04] Saints in glory stand.
[2858.04 → 2873.04] We read us in the hour, down on earth again.
[2873.04 → 2882.04] Open by the devil, watch me, Jesus Christ.
[2882.04 → 2883.04] The stяться I believe, Jesus Christ.
[2883.04 → 2884.04] The mostly can't carry on us either and the peace is not yet.
[2884.04 → 2885.04] ноат Justin.
[2885.04 → 2886.04] Worthy men's house will always be with Eleazar's alt.
[2886.04 → 2887.04] PA.
[2887.04 → 2888.04] The mostly can't carry on us tonight, mostly can't carry on us.
[2888.04 → 2889.04] Bless us, our men archaic shifted to bring upon the start of peace.
[2889.04 → 2892.04] This thee offer ha expects to carry on us, DNA of the map and the Briand for,
[2892.04 → 2907.02] and attend these some flaws handedly,
[2907.06 → 2909.04] which we are born as pride.
[2909.04 → 2914.04] Let the Lord surrender
[2914.04 → 2920.04] In their hands and holy
[2920.04 → 2924.04] O's of victory
[2924.04 → 2931.28] Our kingdom and all of us
[2931.28 → 2936.04] Shall triumphantly
[2936.04 → 2943.04] Unto the power of my team
[2943.04 → 2948.04] Saving on the throne
[2948.04 → 2953.04] And the land victorious
[2953.04 → 2958.04] We have praised the Lord
[2958.04 → 2963.04] Come as from salvation
[2963.04 → 2969.04] May there one rest day
[2969.04 → 2975.04] Who shall all their soul pay
[2975.04 → 2981.04] O we will hear of thee
[2981.04 → 2989.04] You may be seated
[2989.04 → 3005.04] So I'd like to share some thoughts based on the scripture reading that we just had, Revelation 21 verses 1 to 5. Before I do that, please join me in prayer.
[3005.04 → 3011.04] Heavenly Father, we praise you
[3011.04 → 3021.04] For you are the only true God who is able to turn the shadow of death into the light of life.
[3021.04 → 3029.04] So Lord, would you grant us your words of life, your words of peace and of comfort now by the working of your Holy Spirit.
[3029.04 → 3038.04] And Lord, would you focus our hearts and our minds upon your beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3038.04 → 3044.04] We humbly ask for his sake and for the good of your people. Amen.
[3044.04 → 3056.04] So it really does seem just, well it really was only just a few weeks ago that Ali was sitting, you know, right there in the sanctuary on Sunday morning.
[3056.04 → 3058.04] Yes, that seat right there.
[3058.04 → 3065.04] You know, she had her spot and she came faithfully, as far as I know, every Sunday.
[3065.04 → 3068.04] And I was thinking about that.
[3068.04 → 3072.04] How Ali was 98 years old when she died.
[3072.04 → 3080.04] And every Sunday, for close to 98 years, I'm sure her parents brought her when she was, you know, a baby as well.
[3080.04 → 3086.04] Every Sunday for 98 years, she has gone to church on Sunday morning.
[3086.04 → 3089.04] Friends, that is incredible.
[3089.04 → 3091.04] That's a lot of Sundays.
[3091.04 → 3098.04] Her life in this way was a testimony of what it looks like to be a follower of Jesus.
[3098.04 → 3103.04] And it's a testimony to the faithfulness of God in her life.
[3103.04 → 3110.04] Now the question, just thinking about that, the question I want to pose to us this morning is, why?
[3110.04 → 3121.04] Why? Why did Ali come to Sunday worship week after week, year after year for 98 years?
[3121.04 → 3125.04] Well, one answer, of course, is that God created us to worship him.
[3125.04 → 3132.04] And so for Christians, the regular habit of worshipping God on the Lord's Day is one way that we do that.
[3132.04 → 3137.04] One way that we offer ourselves to God in worship.
[3137.04 → 3144.04] And there are many reasons that we could list and talk about as to why we go to church.
[3144.04 → 3164.04] But one of the main reasons I think we should all go to church on Sundays, as Ali did, is that so we might learn how to take our own individual, our little stories, the stories of each of our lives, and to put them into the larger story of the Bible.
[3164.04 → 3175.04] Right? We come to church so that the biblical story of God's redemption through Jesus Christ becomes the story that gives meaning to our own lives.
[3175.04 → 3181.04] It becomes the story that shapes us as people more than anything else.
[3181.04 → 3187.04] Right? Because the thing is, all of us are shaped by some kind of story.
[3187.04 → 3194.04] You know, maybe it's the story of our parents, or the story where we grew up.
[3194.04 → 3199.04] Maybe we're trying to write our own stories for ourselves.
[3199.04 → 3202.04] Or maybe it's the story that our culture tells us.
[3202.04 → 3205.04] But we are people shaped by stories.
[3205.04 → 3210.04] And we will live our lives according to some narrative.
[3210.04 → 3218.04] A narrative of who we are as people, where the world came from, what's the meaning of our lives, what's the purpose of it all.
[3218.04 → 3221.04] We live according to some story.
[3221.04 → 3235.04] And for the Christian, it's the story of the life and death, the resurrection, ascension, and future return of Jesus, that is the true story that we build our lives on.
[3235.04 → 3238.04] That is the true story that we put our hope in.
[3238.04 → 3243.04] I once heard a pastor who told a story about his own family.
[3243.04 → 3249.04] That in their family, they had an uncle who was kind of this larger-than-life figure.
[3249.04 → 3252.04] Everyone admired him and looked up to him.
[3252.04 → 3253.04] He was special to everyone.
[3253.04 → 3263.04] But when he was 65 years old, in seemingly good health, very suddenly and unexpectedly, he died within a short period of time.
[3263.04 → 3269.04] And everyone was just taken aback and so shocked by these circumstances.
[3269.04 → 3273.04] And he, as the pastor, was asked to go and perform the memorial service.
[3273.04 → 3277.04] And so he flew into the airport somewhere in California.
[3277.04 → 3281.04] And there were other relatives that were meeting also at the airport.
[3281.04 → 3286.04] And they all got in the same van to drive to the hotel where they were all staying.
[3286.04 → 3290.04] And as they were driving, one of the members of the family said this to the pastor.
[3290.04 → 3297.04] He said, well, I can't wait to hear what your take on this is.
[3297.04 → 3302.04] I can't wait to hear what your take on this is.
[3302.04 → 3305.04] He meant, in other words, how do we make sense of this?
[3305.04 → 3307.04] I mean, Allie, she lived 98 years.
[3307.04 → 3310.04] And so we'd think, well, of course, you know, we're all going to die one day.
[3310.04 → 3313.04] And 98 years is a long, good life.
[3313.04 → 3320.04] But still, the question remains, how do we make sense of this?
[3320.04 → 3321.04] Right?
[3321.04 → 3335.04] And this guy was saying, I hope you can give us some context, some kind of narrative or story that can make sense of death and of this sorrow that we all feel.
[3335.04 → 3338.04] You know, another way of putting it is this.
[3338.04 → 3341.04] There's an author who wrote in one of his books.
[3341.04 → 3354.04] He said, the essence of what it means to be human is to have hope, to have a story around which we can organize our lives.
[3354.04 → 3361.04] And it is the biblical story around which Christians organize our lives.
[3361.04 → 3369.04] It's a story that we are reminded of Sunday after Sunday, year after year.
[3369.04 → 3376.04] One kind of simple way to think about this biblical story is as a play in four acts.
[3376.04 → 3384.04] The four acts are creation, fall, redemption, and then final consummation, how the story ends.
[3384.04 → 3387.04] And so here is the story very briefly.
[3387.04 → 3393.04] In the first act, you come to the first chapters of the Book of Genesis.
[3393.04 → 3396.04] And the Bible says that God is the creator of all things.
[3396.04 → 3403.04] And he made us to live with him forever in this good world that he made.
[3403.04 → 3405.04] That's act one, creation.
[3405.04 → 3413.04] But then in the second act of the story, it tells how the first people God made, Adam and Eve, they fell into sin.
[3413.04 → 3419.04] What they essentially decided to do is they wanted to write their own script.
[3419.04 → 3423.04] They wanted to be the lead actors in the play.
[3423.04 → 3427.04] And so they dismissed God as the author of the story.
[3428.04 → 3439.04] And the Bible tells us that the source of all our misery in our own lives and the misery of this world basically is trying to live in this world that God has made without him.
[3439.04 → 3449.04] But even though God created us and even though we, all of us, we kind of just dismiss God from our lives, God still loves us.
[3449.04 → 3454.04] And right from the get-go, God had a plan to set it all right.
[3454.04 → 3457.04] This is act three, redemption.
[3457.04 → 3463.04] And God's plan was that in the fullness of time, he would send his son, Jesus Christ, into the world to save us.
[3463.04 → 3473.04] The author of the story wrote himself into the story in order to win us back and to restore all that was broken and lost.
[3474.04 → 3484.04] And so if creation is act one, and we find that in Genesis one and two, and act two is the fall, and we find that in Genesis chapter three,
[3484.04 → 3488.04] well, redemption is pretty much the entire rest of the Bible.
[3488.04 → 3489.04] The Bible, right?
[3489.04 → 3498.04] All the Old Testament is the promise that the Saviour will come, and all the New Testament is the fulfillment of that promise.
[3499.04 → 3503.04] But friends, there's still one more act, consummation.
[3503.04 → 3511.04] And we find that in the very last couple of chapters in the Bible, in Revelation 21 and 22.
[3511.04 → 3516.04] And the final act tells us what is to be one day.
[3516.04 → 3518.04] One day in the future.
[3518.04 → 3520.04] Where is this story heading?
[3520.04 → 3525.04] In other words, we get to know the end of the story ahead of time.
[3525.04 → 3528.04] We get to know how the story ends.
[3528.04 → 3533.04] And that is the passage that we read just a bit ago in Revelation 21.
[3533.04 → 3541.04] It tells us that God is taking this good world that he has made, but that has fallen into ruin because of sin,
[3541.04 → 3548.04] and that through Jesus Christ, he is restoring it once again until, at last, all things will be made new.
[3548.04 → 3557.04] And friends, that is the fact that our life with God, the life for which we were made, will be restored.
[3557.04 → 3561.04] We will be brought back into relationship with God.
[3561.04 → 3564.04] And we find that in verse 3 in our passage.
[3564.04 → 3565.04] It says again,
[3565.04 → 3568.04] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[3568.04 → 3574.04] Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them.
[3574.04 → 3581.04] They will be his people, and God himself will be with them, and he will be their God.
[3581.04 → 3586.04] And then verse 4, it gives us these amazing words of comfort.
[3586.04 → 3591.04] God will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[3591.04 → 3601.04] There will be no more death, or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.
[3601.04 → 3607.04] Friends, that is the Bible's take on death.
[3607.04 → 3612.04] That's what gives meaning and context when someone we love is taken away from us,
[3612.04 → 3616.04] that even death itself will be no more.
[3616.04 → 3625.04] And so friends, when we put our own little lives into this big story of what God is doing in the world, we have hope.
[3625.04 → 3628.04] That is the source of our hope.
[3628.04 → 3631.04] And that has everything to do with our lives today.
[3631.04 → 3635.04] You know, we will still miss Ali.
[3635.04 → 3638.04] We still miss those who are taken away from us.
[3638.04 → 3643.04] But we don't grieve as those who have no hope because we know the end of the story.
[3643.04 → 3649.04] There will be no more death or mourning or crying for the old order of things has passed away.
[3649.04 → 3656.04] And the God who promised it is faithful, and he is good, and he will accomplish it.
[3656.04 → 3663.04] God is the author of the story, and he will bring his story to completion.
[3663.04 → 3667.04] In verse 6 of our passage, Jesus is the one speaking.
[3667.04 → 3674.04] He says, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the A to Z, the beginning and the end.
[3674.04 → 3685.04] And then he says, to the thirsty, I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
[3685.04 → 3690.04] Friends, that is God's invitation to you this morning.
[3690.04 → 3697.04] He invites you to receive freely this water of life that he gives.
[3697.04 → 3705.04] He invites you to find your place in the true story that he is writing, and to receive that life that he offers to you.
[3705.04 → 3711.04] And friends, Jesus can offer you that life because he is the hero of the story.
[3711.04 → 3715.04] Right? He is the hero that has come into our world to rescue us.
[3715.04 → 3717.04] He sacrificed his own life.
[3717.04 → 3722.04] He died in our place on the cross to rescue us from sin and death.
[3722.04 → 3727.04] He rose from the dead, and he triumphed over the grave.
[3727.04 → 3733.04] So that that life that he won, he gives to us freely.
[3733.04 → 3738.04] Because in Jesus, death is not the end of the story. Life is.
[3738.04 → 3741.04] And that's the end of Ali's story.
[3741.04 → 3748.04] It's life. This isn't the end. It's the beginning. It's a new chapter that will continue on forever.
[3748.04 → 3751.04] So in closing, let me just share this little story.
[3751.04 → 3757.04] Two of my literary heroes are C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
[3757.04 → 3764.04] C.S. Lewis was not a Christian, but he had a perfect friend who was a Christian, J.R.R. Tolkien.
[3764.04 → 3769.04] And they were both professors of language and literature at the University of Oxford.
[3769.04 → 3774.04] And they would often gather together by a fireside late at night.
[3774.04 → 3780.04] And they would drink port together, and they would read their latest literary productions to one another.
[3780.04 → 3783.04] And one night they went on a walk.
[3783.04 → 3787.04] And they discussed the resurrection of Jesus.
[3787.04 → 3798.04] And Tolkien made the point to Lewis that, you know, Lewis, you don't have any problem acknowledging the power of the resurrection as a story, as a myth.
[3798.04 → 3801.04] And Lewis said indeed that his scholarship was based on that.
[3801.04 → 3805.04] But then Tolkien challenged Lewis with this thought.
[3805.04 → 3809.04] He said, what I want to challenge you with is this.
[3809.04 → 3816.04] That Christianity in the story of Jesus' resurrection is the myth that actually happened.
[3816.04 → 3830.04] That is to say, the longings that Lewis had in his heart, the longings that all of us have in our hearts for life eternal, for rescue, for all that is sad to become untrue,
[3830.04 → 3839.04] all the answers are found in the actual, real, historical life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[3839.04 → 3843.04] This is the point, he said, where the tales come true.
[3843.04 → 3845.04] They come true in Jesus.
[3845.04 → 3850.04] Two weeks later, C.S. Lewis became a Christian.
[3850.04 → 3863.04] And he said, when I became a Christian, it was like slipping into a pair of new shoes that somehow feel as if they'd been comfortably worn for years.
[3863.04 → 3872.04] That's what it's like when you find your life story in the big story of God.
[3872.04 → 3876.04] When you put that on, it feels like, it feels right.
[3876.04 → 3877.04] It feels at home.
[3877.04 → 3879.04] This is the way it should be.
[3879.04 → 3882.04] And friends, that's what Christianity is.
[3882.04 → 3884.04] It's the true story of our lives.
[3884.04 → 3886.04] It's the story that shaped Ali's life.
[3886.04 → 3891.04] And it's our hope in the face of death.
[3891.04 → 3893.04] So let's pray together.
[3893.04 → 3899.04] Father, you are the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[3899.04 → 3903.04] Lord, you see the end from the beginning.
[3903.04 → 3910.04] And Lord, you are the one who is writing the story of this world and of each of our own lives.
[3910.04 → 3920.04] And Lord, we pray that this morning that we would find hope in the death and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3920.04 → 3926.04] Lord, we thank you again for the life of our dear sister, Allie.
[3926.04 → 3932.04] For the testimony of her life being shaped by this biblical story for so many years.
[3932.04 → 3943.04] And Lord, we pray that each one of us would join her and see her again one day through trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3943.04 → 3948.04] Father, be with those who mourn this morning.
[3948.04 → 3953.04] Be with all of us and comfort us with your peace in the hope that you promise us.
[3953.04 → 3954.04] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[3954.04 → 3955.04] Amen.
[3955.04 → 3957.04] All right.
[3957.04 → 3960.04] So we have a few more songs that we'll be singing.
[3960.04 → 3961.04] Amazing Grace.
[3961.04 → 3962.04] So I invite you to stand.
[3962.04 → 3967.04] And you'll find that in your hymnal on 462, Psalm number 462.
[3967.04 → 3968.04] Please stand.
[3968.04 → 3969.04] The best you know as knowing he is, and it's written on the silly ages of your noise.
[3969.04 → 3972.28] So that this is between your eyes and fancy faith, and it's calm, and haste therefore having this
[3972.28 → 3976.32] strength to the spirit of your union.
[3976.32 → 3977.32] Amen.
[4006.32 → 4008.32] Amen.
[4036.32 → 4038.32] Amen.
[4066.32 → 4068.32] Amen.
[4096.32 → 4098.32] Amen.
[4126.32 → 4128.32] Amen.
[4156.32 → 4157.32] Amen.
[4186.32 → 4204.68] All this I have spoken while still with you, but the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
[4205.72 → 4207.30] Peace I leave with you.
[4208.14 → 4210.06] My peace I give you.
[4210.74 → 4212.96] I do not give to you as the world gives.
[4213.80 → 4215.64] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[4216.32 → 4218.76] And do not be afraid.
[4222.10 → 4229.86] So, this is Christopher, and he is the grandson of Ali, and he will be leading us on piano.
[4230.08 → 4235.86] And so for the next song, it's actually going to be found on your insert, the insert in your program.
[4236.28 → 4241.84] We'll be singing There is Peace in the Valley, and we'll begin with verse 1.
[4241.84 → 4242.50] So not the chorus.
[4242.60 → 4246.10] We'll sing verse 1, and then we'll go to the chorus, and verse 2, chorus, verse 3, chorus.
[4246.32 → 4247.60] Thanks, Lord.
[4247.78 → 4248.02] Amen.
[4248.02 → 4248.32] Amen.
[4248.32 → 4249.32] Amen.

[4440.84 → 4442.84] Amen.
[4470.84 → 4472.84] Amen.
[4500.84 → 4501.62] Let's pray.
[4503.48 → 4510.94] Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have received Ali into your presence in fullness of joy.
[4511.54 → 4514.26] You have welcomed her into your arms of mercy.
[4515.04 → 4518.06] And in that knowledge, Lord, we rest and we hope.
[4518.74 → 4522.06] We rejoice that as you live, she also lives.
[4522.92 → 4526.22] And as you have triumphed over death, she too triumphs over death.
[4526.68 → 4530.80] And as you have risen from the dead, so too, Ali, with all who know Christ.
[4530.84 → 4532.58] Will rise from the dead.
[4533.60 → 4537.44] Almighty Father of mercies and giver of comfort.
[4537.74 → 4540.32] Lord, would you deal graciously with all of us who mourn.
[4541.20 → 4546.58] That casting all their care on you, they may know the consolation of your love.
[4547.14 → 4549.60] Through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whose name we pray.
[4550.08 → 4550.44] Amen.
[4551.92 → 4553.42] Friends, receive the benediction.
[4554.58 → 4559.10] Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him.
[4559.10 → 4559.18] Amen.
[4559.56 → 4563.98] So that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[4564.54 → 4567.98] In the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[4568.86 → 4569.26] Amen.
[4570.82 → 4573.12] So we'll sing our final song.
[4573.12 → 4576.48] Which is, God is with you till we meet again.
[4576.48 → 4576.96] Amen.
[4576.96 → 4578.96] Amen.
[4606.96 → 4608.96] Amen.

[4792.96 → 4794.96] Amen.
[4794.96 → 4796.96] You may be seated.
[4796.96 → 4804.96] We are so grateful that you have come today to join with us in this time of worship.
[4804.96 → 4811.96] And you are all invited to a reception in the fellowship hall right through the doors in that direction.
[4811.96 → 4820.96] And please remain seated until the ushers dismiss you row by row, beginning in the front with the family.
[4841.96 → 4847.96] Thank you.
[4847.96 → 4849.96] Amen.
