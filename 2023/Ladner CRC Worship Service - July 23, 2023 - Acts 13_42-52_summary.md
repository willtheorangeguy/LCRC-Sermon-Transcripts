• Jesus' message is spreading through Paul's preaching in Antioch
• The Jewish synagogue initially responds positively to Paul's teachings, but then contradicts and opposes them
• The problem for the Jews of Antioch isn't that Gentiles are being popular or well-liked, but rather that they're being received by God as equals without converting to Judaism through circumcision
• The message of the gospel is that everyone who believes in Jesus is set free from sin and has justification, regardless of their past actions.
• This idea is deeply insulting to Jews who believe they are God's chosen people due to their commitment to the law.
• God only demands one thing: recognition of our desperate need for salvation, which is obtained by acknowledging we have nothing to offer but our own sinful nature.

• The word of God is about believing in Jesus and obeying Him
• The gospel is divisive, causing people to react with hostility or foolishness
• The message of Christ crucified is a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles
• Only those whom God has called will see the power and wisdom of God in Christ
• Freedom and joy are not stumbling blocks, but rather a corner stone that will be built upon.
• The response to this situation should be one of trust in a sovereign Father who loves and provides for us.
• Our good deeds do not contribute to His love or affection.
• We can rest in the arms of a loving Father and worship Him because He is worthy.
