[281.52 --> 288.96]  is not only transcendent and sovereign and holy and other but also he is a God

[594.20 --> 607.38]  Lord Jesus, we join our hearts with your people throughout the world and throughout the ages, whom you have purchased with your blood at the cost of your life.
[607.80 --> 611.50]  And we say joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[611.50 --> 617.34]  You who lived in unfathomable glory from all eternity.
[618.34 --> 622.30]  You came in humility to be with us.
[622.90 --> 627.90]  You left the glories of heaven to enter into the lonely exile of your people.
[627.90 --> 644.60]  You entered into the darkness of our world brought about by our sin to bring us into your life and into your eternal kingdom of peace and joy and goodness that you are spreading throughout this world that you have made.
[644.60 --> 649.58]  And now, Jesus, you sit at the right hand of the Father in glory.
[650.46 --> 661.76]  And you have sent your spirit to dwell in us as we wait for you to come again to judge the living and the dead and to reconcile all things in heaven and on earth to yourself.
[663.24 --> 668.64]  It is in your name, Lord Jesus, King of the nations, that we pray.

[1157.60 --> 1164.78]  But also it's a good reminder that we need to always be repenting and turning to God in faith.
[1164.94 --> 1166.12]  That is the Christian life.
[1167.14 --> 1170.96]  And so I will read a few verses for us and then we will just pray together.
[1171.18 --> 1172.72]  So this is from Isaiah chapter 7.
[1174.54 --> 1176.42]  Again, the Lord spoke to Ahaz.
[1176.42 --> 1183.36]  Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heavens.
[1183.36 --> 1187.66]  But Ahaz said, I will not ask.
[1188.32 --> 1190.76]  I will not put the Lord to the test.
[1192.14 --> 1196.60]  Then Isaiah said, hear now, you house of David.
[1196.92 --> 1199.84]  Is it not enough to try the patience of humans?
[1200.18 --> 1203.60]  Will you try the patience of my God also?
[1204.44 --> 1207.44]  Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[1207.44 --> 1214.48]  The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and you will call him Emmanuel.
[1215.38 --> 1216.52]  Let's pray.
[1220.12 --> 1228.54]  Oh Lord, we confess that we also try the patience of our God.
[1228.54 --> 1237.26]  Lord, as we sin against you and rebellion toward your word and your laws.
[1238.04 --> 1240.74]  Lord, as we sin against one another.
[1242.42 --> 1245.42]  And Lord, as we cause evil and harm in this world.
[1246.58 --> 1248.14]  Lord, we test your patience.
[1248.32 --> 1255.22]  But Lord, we thank you that you are God of immense patience toward us.
[1255.22 --> 1260.20]  That you are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1261.02 --> 1264.50]  And that you purposed, Lord, to save your people.
[1264.70 --> 1267.68]  Not because of who we are or our goodness.
[1267.98 --> 1272.48]  But fully, completely out of your free grace.
[1272.60 --> 1273.62]  Your amazing grace.
[1274.18 --> 1275.58]  That you have for us.
[1275.90 --> 1280.64]  Your compassion and your steadfast love.
[1280.64 --> 1285.76]  And Lord, you sent us a sign because you sent Jesus, Emmanuel.
[1286.52 --> 1291.14]  To be with us and to take upon himself the sin of the world.
[1291.96 --> 1294.58]  To put it to death on the cross.
[1295.24 --> 1299.64]  So that we might know the forgiveness of our Heavenly Father.
[1300.48 --> 1303.88]  Lord, we rejoice before you today, especially.
[1304.78 --> 1306.30]  Because Jesus has come.
[1306.72 --> 1307.68]  The light of the world.
[1307.82 --> 1308.62]  Our salvation.
[1308.62 --> 1310.64]  And Lord, so we thank you.
[1310.74 --> 1312.92]  We pray that you would help us, Lord.
[1313.64 --> 1315.74]  To follow in your footsteps.
[1315.90 --> 1317.32]  To follow the way of our Savior.
[1318.50 --> 1322.96]  Lord, to be quick to confess when we sin against you.
[1323.20 --> 1326.52]  And to be quick to seek your forgiveness.
[1327.16 --> 1330.58]  And to, Lord, enjoy the relationship that you have created us to have with you.
[1331.22 --> 1333.76]  And so, Lord, strengthen us, your people, today by your grace.
[1333.86 --> 1335.00]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1335.40 --> 1335.72]  Amen.
[1335.72 --> 1335.82]  Amen.
[1335.82 --> 1343.26]  So, let's stand again, and we will sing one of my favorites.
[1343.62 --> 1344.94]  Good Christian Friends Rejoice.
[1345.04 --> 1346.46]  Let's stand and let's sing together.
[1346.46 --> 1348.46]  together.
[1376.46 --> 1380.46]  Christ is born today,
[1380.46 --> 1384.46]  Christ is born today,
[1384.46 --> 1388.46]  God is blessed in full and above,
[1388.46 --> 1392.46]  and He is in the manger now.
[1392.46 --> 1396.46]  Christ is born today,
[1396.46 --> 1400.46]  Christ is born today.
[1400.46 --> 1406.46]  The Christian friends rejoice,
[1406.46 --> 1410.46]  with heart and soul and voice,
[1410.46 --> 1414.46]  now you hear of endless bliss,
[1414.46 --> 1418.46]  Jesus Christ was born for this.
[1418.46 --> 1422.46]  He has opened heaven's stone,
[1422.46 --> 1426.46]  and we are blessed so evermore,
[1426.46 --> 1430.46]  Christ was born for this.
[1430.46 --> 1434.46]  Christ was born for this.
[1434.46 --> 1438.46]  With Christians blessed rejoice,
[1438.46 --> 1442.46]  with heart and soul their voice,
[1442.46 --> 1446.46]  now you be not filled and way,
[1446.46 --> 1450.46]  Jesus Christ was born to save,
[1450.46 --> 1454.46]  Jesus Christ was born to save,
[1454.46 --> 1458.46]  Calls you Lord and calls you all,
[1458.46 --> 1462.46]  To gain his everlasting love,
[1462.46 --> 1466.46]  Christ was born to save,
[1466.46 --> 1468.46]  Christ was born to save.
[1468.46 --> 1472.46]  Christ was born to save.
[1472.46 --> 1474.46]  Christ was born to save.
[1474.46 --> 1482.46]  You may be seated.
[1482.46 --> 1488.46]  Oh, no?
[1488.46 --> 1490.46]  Yeah, you can be seated too.
[1490.46 --> 1492.46]  Thank you.
[1492.46 --> 1496.46]  Thank you especially to Mel,
[1496.46 --> 1498.46]  and our singers,
[1498.46 --> 1500.46]  and John for coming out and serving again
[1500.46 --> 1501.46]  on this Christmas day.
[1501.46 --> 1503.46]  And they're doing an amazing job.
[1503.46 --> 1505.46]  So again, good morning.
[1505.46 --> 1509.46]  And we're looking again today at Isaiah chapter 9.
[1509.46 --> 1511.46]  Just a few verses,
[1511.46 --> 1512.46]  and we'll have them on the screen.
[1512.46 --> 1514.46]  You feel free to open your Bibles if you want.
[1514.46 --> 1517.46]  But we will be turning to this wonderful,
[1517.46 --> 1520.46]  wonderful passage today from Isaiah chapter 9.
[1520.46 --> 1522.46]  And we'll actually,
[1522.46 --> 1525.46]  we're continuing in our Advent series,
[1525.46 --> 1527.46]  based on the O antiphons,
[1527.46 --> 1533.46]  which are the seven short prayers of the historic Christian church,
[1533.46 --> 1537.46]  that addresses Jesus using these names and titles
[1537.46 --> 1539.46]  that are found in the book of Isaiah.
[1539.46 --> 1541.46]  And on this Christmas day,
[1541.46 --> 1545.46]  our passage here invites us to meditate on Jesus
[1545.46 --> 1547.46]  as the King of the nations.
[1547.46 --> 1548.46]  Okay?
[1548.46 --> 1550.46]  The King of the nations.
[1550.46 --> 1553.46]  Now, before we read the passage,
[1553.46 --> 1556.46]  around this time of year,
[1556.46 --> 1560.46]  there is an annual debate that happens.
[1560.46 --> 1562.46]  And the debate is about
[1562.46 --> 1567.46]  when is the appropriate time to begin singing Christmas music?
[1567.46 --> 1569.46]  Do you know this debate?
[1569.46 --> 1571.46]  I don't know if you have it in your households.
[1571.46 --> 1573.46]  So there are those who think,
[1573.46 --> 1576.46]  you can start listening to Christmas music
[1576.46 --> 1578.46]  any time after Labor Day.
[1578.46 --> 1580.46]  Who's, who's in that?
[1580.46 --> 1581.46]  Team.
[1581.46 --> 1582.46]  No.
[1582.46 --> 1583.46]  Oh, no.
[1583.46 --> 1584.46]  Okay.
[1584.46 --> 1586.46]  Um, now there are others who argue
[1586.46 --> 1588.46]  any time after Thanksgiving.
[1588.46 --> 1590.46]  Any takers?
[1590.46 --> 1592.46]  Any proponents of that one?
[1592.46 --> 1593.46]  No?
[1593.46 --> 1594.46]  Okay.
[1594.46 --> 1595.46]  What do you guys think?
[1595.46 --> 1596.46]  December?
[1596.46 --> 1597.46]  December 1st starts?
[1597.46 --> 1598.46]  That's okay?
[1598.46 --> 1599.46]  Okay.
[1599.46 --> 1603.46]  But there are those also who think all of y'all are wrong.
[1603.46 --> 1607.46]  That actually, you can listen to Christmas music
[1607.46 --> 1609.46]  any time of year.
[1609.46 --> 1610.46]  Anybody?
[1610.46 --> 1611.46]  Anybody for that one?
[1611.46 --> 1612.46]  Yes.
[1612.46 --> 1613.46]  Okay.
[1613.46 --> 1614.46]  A couple.
[1614.46 --> 1615.46]  Your granddaughter.
[1615.46 --> 1616.46]  Yeah.
[1616.46 --> 1617.46]  Okay.
[1617.46 --> 1620.46]  I served with a pastor once who loved to sing
[1620.46 --> 1623.46]  Joy to the World in July.
[1623.46 --> 1626.46]  And he's the kind of guy who also left his Christmas tree up
[1626.46 --> 1628.46]  six months out of the year.
[1628.46 --> 1630.46]  No, really he did.
[1630.46 --> 1633.46]  But the issue is how early is too early?
[1633.46 --> 1634.46]  Too early.
[1634.46 --> 1635.46]  Right?
[1635.46 --> 1636.46]  When do we start feeling Christmassy?
[1636.46 --> 1637.46]  When's appropriate?
[1637.46 --> 1638.46]  All that kind of thing.
[1638.46 --> 1641.46]  But our passage this morning is a reminder that God actually
[1641.46 --> 1647.46]  started preparing for Christmas way earlier than we ever did.
[1647.46 --> 1650.46]  And way earlier than we might even imagine.
[1650.46 --> 1658.46]  Because this passage in Isaiah was written 700 years before Jesus was born.
[1658.46 --> 1662.46]  That is a lot of preparation.
[1662.46 --> 1669.46]  And so I think it tells us it was on God's heart that it was so important for his people
[1669.46 --> 1673.46]  to prepare for Jesus' coming at Christmas.
[1673.46 --> 1681.46]  And I think that means that no less for us we need this same message as we celebrate Jesus' coming today.
[1681.46 --> 1687.46]  So let's read just Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 to 7.
[1687.46 --> 1690.46]  And I'll read these words for us.
[1690.46 --> 1720.46] 
[1720.46 --> 1725.46]  And forever the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[1725.46 --> 1728.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1728.46 --> 1729.46]  Let's pray.
[1729.46 --> 1742.46]  Father, we thank you for your zeal, your heart, your enthusiasm, your purpose to save us.
[1742.46 --> 1750.46]  And Lord, we pray that you would come once again, Lord, by your Holy Spirit this morning,
[1750.46 --> 1761.46]  here in Ladner, here among us, this congregation, that we might know your heart and your love for us on this Christmas day.
[1761.46 --> 1764.46]  And we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1764.46 --> 1768.46]  So if you've grown up in the church, you know this passage pretty well.
[1768.46 --> 1774.46]  I'm sure in this pulpit on Christmas Day you may have heard it before.
[1774.46 --> 1778.46]  It's printed on many Christmas cards as well.
[1778.46 --> 1785.46]  And I think you might find it interesting to know that up until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989,
[1785.46 --> 1793.46]  it was illegal to read this passage in the pulpits of the churches in Eastern Europe under the Soviet Union
[1793.46 --> 1799.46]  because it talks about the coming of a true king.
[1799.46 --> 1803.46]  A true king who will reign forever and ever.
[1803.46 --> 1808.46]  It talks about a new government that will throw down every oppressor.
[1808.46 --> 1814.46]  And then, of course, thanks to the composer, George Frederick Handel, right,
[1814.46 --> 1820.46]  who set this passage of Scripture to music in his now-famous Messiah.
[1820.46 --> 1827.46]  Nearly everyone in the westernized world knows the words of Isaiah 9,
[1827.46 --> 1831.46]  even if they don't know that it comes from Isaiah.
[1831.46 --> 1834.46]  The pivotal verse, of course, is verse 6.
[1834.46 --> 1840.46]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given,
[1840.46 --> 1842.46]  and the government will be on his shoulders,
[1842.46 --> 1848.46]  and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[1848.46 --> 1851.46]  Was anybody trying to sing it as I read that?
[1851.46 --> 1853.46]  He ever left. I won't do it.
[1853.46 --> 1855.46]  John can get up here and do it for us.
[1855.46 --> 1861.46]  And so these words, you know, are so much kind of ingrained into our culture even.
[1861.46 --> 1868.46]  But, you know, now any time a child is born, our spirits are lifted, right?
[1868.46 --> 1869.46]  We love kids.
[1869.46 --> 1873.46]  Any opportunity to hold a child is a wonderful thing.
[1873.46 --> 1879.46]  That's why I would love more opportunities to serve in the nursery,
[1879.46 --> 1881.46]  if anybody wants to trade places with me.
[1881.46 --> 1884.46]  Because what a better thing to do on a Sunday morning than to hold a baby.
[1885.46 --> 1890.46]  Isaiah, however, is clearly speaking not of any child.
[1890.46 --> 1894.46]  You know, parents, grandparents, whenever a child is born,
[1894.46 --> 1898.46]  we think suddenly this is the most amazing, the most beautiful,
[1898.46 --> 1901.46]  the most special child that's ever been born or ever will be born.
[1901.46 --> 1903.46]  That's natural.
[1903.46 --> 1908.46]  But actually, Jesus really is the most unique, the most beautiful,
[1908.46 --> 1911.46]  the most special child who was ever born.
[1911.46 --> 1913.46]  Because look at what it says.
[1913.46 --> 1915.46]  We can keep that passage up for a bit.
[1915.46 --> 1917.46]  It says,
[1917.46 --> 1924.46]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given.
[1924.46 --> 1926.46]  Note those verbs.
[1926.46 --> 1929.46]  Born, given.
[1929.46 --> 1931.46]  Born, given, right?
[1931.46 --> 1935.46]  Born suggests the child's real humanity.
[1935.46 --> 1937.46]  Jesus became fully human.
[1937.46 --> 1939.46]  He became just like us.
[1939.46 --> 1944.46]  Given, well, that suggests something else, right?
[1944.46 --> 1946.46]  Given by whom?
[1946.46 --> 1952.46]  Given suggests actions beyond that of the parents.
[1952.46 --> 1953.46]  Right?
[1953.46 --> 1957.46]  A child that is given suggests an act of God.
[1957.46 --> 1963.46]  Well, so the question then is, well, what kind of child will he be?
[1963.46 --> 1965.46]  Who is this child?
[1965.46 --> 1970.46]  Who is this king who is coming to free his people from oppression
[1970.46 --> 1975.46]  and to end all war and to reign forever and ever?
[1975.46 --> 1981.46]  And we learn about this child by these names that he is given.
[1981.46 --> 1982.46]  Right?
[1982.46 --> 1985.46]  Just look at who this child is from these amazing names that he's given.
[1985.46 --> 1989.46]  He will be called Wonderful Counselor.
[1989.46 --> 1990.46]  Mighty God.
[1990.46 --> 1992.46]  Everlasting Father.
[1992.46 --> 1994.46]  Prince of Peace.
[1994.46 --> 1999.46]  For reasons this morning to adore Jesus.
[1999.46 --> 2002.46]  So first, let's talk about them each briefly.
[2002.46 --> 2006.46]  First, he is Wonderful Counselor.
[2006.46 --> 2012.46]  The counselor, of course, is someone to whom we turn for advice.
[2012.46 --> 2014.46]  For wisdom.
[2014.46 --> 2015.46]  Right?
[2015.46 --> 2019.46]  Somebody who embodies insight and discernment and truth,
[2019.46 --> 2023.46]  who can open our eyes to reality and help us point the way.
[2023.46 --> 2028.46]  And the counsel of this child is wonderful.
[2028.46 --> 2031.46]  It's actually a word that means it's full of glory.
[2031.46 --> 2033.46]  It's even supernatural.
[2033.46 --> 2041.46]  And so the wisdom of this child, the guidance, his teaching is astounding.
[2041.46 --> 2042.46]  It is breathtaking.
[2042.46 --> 2045.46]  It comes from God himself.
[2045.46 --> 2046.46]  Right?
[2046.46 --> 2050.46]  And that is the experience of all those who heard Jesus teach.
[2050.46 --> 2051.46]  Right?
[2051.46 --> 2053.46]  They heard him and they would say to themselves,
[2053.46 --> 2057.46]  we have never heard anybody speak like this before.
[2057.46 --> 2058.46]  Right?
[2058.46 --> 2060.46]  His words had that effect on people.
[2060.46 --> 2065.46]  And as we hear this wonderful counselor speak,
[2065.46 --> 2069.46]  in the words of scripture, we open up the Bible, we read it.
[2069.46 --> 2073.46]  So many people throughout the world, throughout the ages have said,
[2073.46 --> 2076.46]  they hear the words of Jesus and they say,
[2076.46 --> 2078.46]  he gets me.
[2078.46 --> 2081.46]  He really knows me.
[2081.46 --> 2086.46]  After the Samaritan woman encountered Jesus in John 4,
[2086.46 --> 2089.46]  her testimony back to her hometown is,
[2089.46 --> 2095.46]  come and meet a man who told me everything I ever did.
[2095.46 --> 2099.46]  Could this be the Christ?
[2099.46 --> 2103.46]  She had met the wonderful counselor.
[2103.46 --> 2107.46]  Second, he is mighty God.
[2107.46 --> 2108.46]  Right?
[2108.46 --> 2113.46]  Last Sunday, we, not yesterday, but Sunday before we baptized Nathan and Noah.
[2113.46 --> 2115.46]  Those are good biblical names.
[2115.46 --> 2116.46]  I like those names.
[2116.46 --> 2117.46]  Nathan and Noah.
[2118.46 --> 2126.46]  But no mother today or in Isaiah's time would ever call her child mighty God.
[2126.46 --> 2127.46]  Right?
[2127.46 --> 2130.46]  If Lorna and Kenny named their child, this is mighty God.
[2130.46 --> 2133.46]  We might have to have a conversation.
[2133.46 --> 2136.46]  And it's not just saying, hey, you know, he's special.
[2136.46 --> 2139.46]  He's kind of inspired in some unique way.
[2139.46 --> 2143.46]  No, it's saying this child is God.
[2143.46 --> 2144.46]  God.
[2144.46 --> 2145.46]  God.
[2145.46 --> 2149.46]  This is a human being before whom it would be entirely appropriate,
[2149.46 --> 2153.46]  if not necessary, to bow down and worship.
[2153.46 --> 2156.46]  That's what the shepherds did.
[2156.46 --> 2157.46]  Right?
[2157.46 --> 2158.46]  That's what the Magi did.
[2158.46 --> 2163.46]  They came to find the king to whom they owed worship.
[2163.46 --> 2166.46]  In Hebrew, it's El Gabor.
[2166.46 --> 2167.46]  El Gabor.
[2167.46 --> 2168.46]  Everyone say it with me.
[2168.46 --> 2169.46]  El Gabor.
[2169.46 --> 2172.46]  El means God.
[2172.46 --> 2178.46]  Gabor means hero or champion or warrior.
[2178.46 --> 2183.46]  So, like God himself, this child possesses great strength.
[2183.46 --> 2188.46]  Strength to deliver his people from any oppression.
[2188.46 --> 2195.46]  Strength to put all wars to end and to rule over them as a good and righteous king.
[2195.46 --> 2201.46]  Now, third, we see he is the everlasting father.
[2201.46 --> 2203.46]  How does that make sense, right?
[2203.46 --> 2204.46]  He's a child.
[2204.46 --> 2205.46]  How can he be the father?
[2205.46 --> 2206.46]  He's the son.
[2206.46 --> 2213.46]  But actually, we see as the Bible unfolds that this child is the eternal son of the father.
[2213.46 --> 2217.46]  And he is of the eternal father.
[2217.46 --> 2219.46]  And yet, he's the eternal son.
[2219.46 --> 2222.46]  And so, he has these father-like qualities.
[2222.46 --> 2224.46]  He is the image of the invisible God.
[2224.46 --> 2228.46]  So, all the qualities of God the father, he possesses himself.
[2228.46 --> 2231.46]  He is everlasting father.
[2231.46 --> 2239.46]  And in the Bible, of course, when we hear the word father, it's not kind of the father who kind of hides himself behind the sports page of the newspaper.
[2239.46 --> 2246.46]  It is a father who is characterized by caring for the helpless.
[2246.46 --> 2250.46]  Giving strength to the weak.
[2250.46 --> 2257.46]  In Israel, the ideal king would be a father to the people.
[2257.46 --> 2268.46]  And these fatherly qualities of protecting the people, guiding the people, ruling over them in goodness, are perfectly expressed in Jesus.
[2268.46 --> 2273.46]  Jesus came to be the shepherd king of his people.
[2273.46 --> 2282.46]  And in the end, we see it's most clearly his care for his people because he died for them.
[2282.46 --> 2286.46]  He died for us so that we might receive the forgiveness of our sins.
[2286.46 --> 2293.46]  And these father-like qualities of Jesus, they are everlasting.
[2293.46 --> 2299.46]  Which means he's never going to grow tired of serving us and helping us.
[2299.46 --> 2306.46]  Now, fourth and finally, he is the prince of peace.
[2306.46 --> 2307.46]  Right?
[2307.46 --> 2315.46]  This child will be the one who will usher in and administer the shalom of God.
[2315.46 --> 2316.46]  Right?
[2316.46 --> 2318.46]  Shalom, we've talked about it a lot.
[2318.46 --> 2321.46]  You know, it's more than just the absence of war.
[2321.46 --> 2323.46]  Shalom is the presence of glory.
[2323.46 --> 2327.46]  Shalom is the presence and the fullness of God's kingdom.
[2327.46 --> 2331.46]  And this child is the prince of peace.
[2331.46 --> 2340.46]  And he brings peace to our hearts, to our families, to our world because he is peace himself.
[2340.46 --> 2349.46]  Through him, we can have true eternal peace between ourselves and our creator.
[2349.46 --> 2355.46]  So who is this child born in a manger on Christmas Day?
[2355.46 --> 2358.46]  He is wonderful counselor.
[2358.46 --> 2360.46]  He is mighty God.
[2360.46 --> 2362.46]  He is everlasting father.
[2362.46 --> 2364.46]  He is prince of peace.
[2364.46 --> 2373.46]  And notice, not just one name, but four names that are inseparable.
[2373.46 --> 2374.46]  Right?
[2374.46 --> 2380.46]  And so that means we can't just think, well, you know, I'll take a little bit of counsel.
[2380.46 --> 2382.46]  I need some advice sometimes.
[2382.46 --> 2384.46]  I'm good on the God front.
[2384.46 --> 2386.46]  Maybe some peace.
[2386.46 --> 2387.46]  That would be kind of nice.
[2387.46 --> 2388.46]  Right?
[2388.46 --> 2389.46]  We don't get to do that.
[2389.46 --> 2395.46]  He is who he is to us because he is all of these things together.
[2395.46 --> 2405.46]  And then, you know, the passage we read earlier, you know, what does the angel, what do the angels, they say to the shepherds in Luke 2.
[2405.46 --> 2410.46]  They say this, the angel said to them, do not be afraid.
[2410.46 --> 2415.46]  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people today in the town of David.
[2415.46 --> 2420.46]  A savior has been born to you.
[2420.46 --> 2421.46]  You.
[2421.46 --> 2422.46]  To you.
[2422.46 --> 2423.46]  To you.
[2423.46 --> 2424.46]  He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[2424.46 --> 2425.46]  Right?
[2425.46 --> 2429.46]  Those same words from our pivotal verse in Isaiah 9, verse 6.
[2429.46 --> 2434.46]  For to you, unto you, a child is born.
[2434.46 --> 2436.46]  He's born to you.
[2436.46 --> 2437.46]  To all of us.
[2437.46 --> 2441.46]  So this child is like no other child who has been born.
[2441.46 --> 2443.46]  He is the Lord.
[2443.46 --> 2444.46]  He is the Messiah.
[2444.46 --> 2445.46]  He is God.
[2445.46 --> 2448.46]  He has come to reign.
[2448.46 --> 2454.46]  He has come to restore his fallen creation and everything in it.
[2454.46 --> 2455.46]  Thanks be to God.
[2455.46 --> 2458.46]  Let's pray together.
[2458.46 --> 2466.46]  Father, we thank you that you have sent the exact child that we need.
[2466.46 --> 2468.46]  You sent yourself.
[2468.46 --> 2470.46]  You are the savior we need.
[2470.46 --> 2473.46]  There is no other savior.
[2473.46 --> 2479.46]  Lord, you know our deepest need better than we know it ourselves.
[2479.46 --> 2483.46]  And so, Lord, would you help us to trust you.
[2483.46 --> 2484.46]  You made us.
[2484.46 --> 2485.46]  You know who we are.
[2485.46 --> 2487.46]  You know what our need is, our predicaments.
[2487.46 --> 2492.46]  And Lord, help us to receive this gift, the gift of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2492.46 --> 2494.46]  The perfect present.
[2494.46 --> 2497.46]  That was just what we were looking for, even if we didn't know it.
[2497.46 --> 2504.46]  And Lord, as we, you know, heard last night at our Christmas Eve service, Lord, we need to unwrap this gift.
[2504.46 --> 2506.46]  We need to pick that up.
[2506.46 --> 2509.46]  And Lord, would you help each of us to do that this morning.
[2509.46 --> 2511.46]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2511.46 --> 2512.46]  Amen.
[2512.46 --> 2516.46]  Let's stand and let's sing the first Noel together.
[2516.46 --> 2517.46]  Let's stand.
[2517.46 --> 2518.46]  Let's stand.
[2518.46 --> 2520.46]  Let's stand.
[2520.46 --> 2522.46]  Let's stand.
[2522.46 --> 2524.46]  Let's stand.
[2524.46 --> 2525.46]  Let's stand.
[2525.46 --> 2526.46]  Let's stand.
[2526.46 --> 2527.46]  Let's stand.
[2527.46 --> 2529.46]  Let's stand.
[2529.46 --> 2532.46]  Let's stand.
[2532.46 --> 2533.46]  Let's stand.
[2533.46 --> 2534.46]  Amen.
[2563.46 --> 2565.46]  Amen.
[2593.46 --> 2595.46]  Amen.
[2623.46 --> 2625.46]  Amen.
[2653.46 --> 2655.46]  Amen.
[2683.46 --> 2685.46]  Amen.
[2713.46 --> 2715.46]  Amen.
[2743.46 --> 2745.46]  Amen.
[2773.46 --> 2775.46]  Amen.
[2775.46 --> 2776.46]  Amen.
[2776.46 --> 2777.46]  Amen.
[2777.46 --> 2778.46]  Amen.
[2778.46 --> 2780.46]  Amen.
[2780.46 --> 2781.46]  Amen.
[2781.46 --> 2783.46]  Amen.
[2783.46 --> 2789.46]  So we will continue to worship the Lord on this day by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[2789.46 --> 2794.46]  Our designated offering for today is World Renew.
[2794.46 --> 2800.46]  And World Renew provides aid to people around the world struggling with hunger, poverty,
[2800.46 --> 2801.46]  and illness.
[2801.46 --> 2804.46]  So may I invite the deacons to come up and collect the morning offering.
[2804.46 --> 2809.46]  And while they do that, we will just remain seated and we can sing another Christmas carol
[2809.46 --> 2810.46]  this morning, Away in a Manger.
[2831.46 --> 2841.46]  No grave in a Manger, no grave for a pet.
[2841.46 --> 2850.46]  The little old Jesus, living down his sweet head.
[2850.46 --> 2860.46]  The love closed in me that I will get you from the tree.
[2860.46 --> 2862.46]  The little Lord Strong and yards, passing on the near First way.
[2862.46 --> 2869.04]  O Lord Jesus, I'll sing on the name.
[2871.04 --> 2879.90]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2879.90 --> 2889.26]  My little Lord Jesus, of thy in the name.
[2889.26 --> 2898.46]  My little Lord Jesus, look down from the sky.
[2898.46 --> 2908.82]  And say, my life, come to you all in this night.
[2908.82 --> 2918.02]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2918.02 --> 2927.22]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2927.22 --> 2936.42]  My little Lord Jesus, I'll sing on the name.
[2936.42 --> 2945.62]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2945.62 --> 2954.82]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2954.82 --> 2956.82]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2956.82 --> 2958.82]  The cattle are lowly, the baby of age.
[2958.82 --> 2964.34]  You know, one of the things, of course, that Christmas tells us, reminds us of, is that
[2964.34 --> 2966.02]  God is not aloof.
[2966.02 --> 2971.62]  He doesn't stand apart from the world and our problems in it.
[2971.62 --> 2973.02]  He's not far off.
[2973.02 --> 2978.22]  You know, he's not blind to our pain and the pain of the world, but he sees it and he has
[2978.22 --> 2981.26]  come and he felt it himself as a man.
[2981.26 --> 2987.02]  He's entered into it, into a dark, small town, a manger.
[2987.02 --> 2990.22]  And ultimately, he came to heal it.
[2990.22 --> 2993.82]  He came to heal us and he needed to heal the world and to make all things right again.
[2993.82 --> 3002.70]  So, one of the things that we do as we worship God is we lift up to him all of our concerns,
[3002.70 --> 3007.42]  the problems that we are facing in our own lives and maybe in our families, and the problems
[3007.42 --> 3008.94]  that we see around us in the world.
[3009.90 --> 3014.22]  And we do so because we know that he hears us.
[3014.22 --> 3019.90]  He knows that he loves us and that he is zealous to bring his restoration to all things.
[3019.90 --> 3025.82]  And so, we'll pray together this morning and at a few points, when I say, Lord, in your
[3025.82 --> 3031.42]  mercy, I invite you to respond, hear our prayer, and we will conclude with the Lord's Prayer.
[3032.86 --> 3033.66]  Okay, so let's pray.
[3037.90 --> 3043.90]  Our Heavenly Father, Eternal God, we bow before you this morning.
[3044.46 --> 3046.14]  You are the Eternal King.
[3046.14 --> 3049.26]  Lord, you are worthy of our worship.
[3049.98 --> 3052.06]  You are worthy of our adoration.
[3053.02 --> 3056.06]  You are worthy of our very lives.
[3056.06 --> 3057.90]  We submit ourselves to you.
[3057.90 --> 3060.06]  We put ourselves under your Lordship.
[3061.34 --> 3070.62]  And we praise you for the mystery of the Incarnation, the Eternal God, from before all ages, who created
[3070.62 --> 3078.06]  all things, submitted himself to his creation, he humbled himself, became a baby.
[3079.10 --> 3080.94]  Father, it's inconceivable.
[3082.46 --> 3083.34]  But it is true.
[3083.90 --> 3084.78]  You have done so.
[3085.98 --> 3093.34]  We praise you that you entered into the darkness of our world to be our light, to be God with us,
[3093.34 --> 3098.62]  to be the King of all the nations, the King of glory.
[3100.22 --> 3105.58]  And so, Lord, we lift up to you this morning all of those, all of us who sit in darkness.
[3106.70 --> 3122.46]  So many people today, even on this Christmas day, in our world, are weary, exhausted, worried, sad, angry.
[3123.90 --> 3131.82]  We pray for all those who are bearing the heaviness of the world, the lonely, the fearful, the suffering, the grieving.
[3132.94 --> 3140.54]  Lord, we pray especially for the sick among us, and those tending to them and who care for them.
[3140.54 --> 3147.02]  Lord, especially, we lift up those names that we know in our hearts before you.
[3147.50 --> 3148.64]  And we pray in hope.
[3149.46 --> 3152.06]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3153.34 --> 3158.92]  God, we remember still those around the world who are suddenly without a home.
[3160.08 --> 3166.04]  Lord, maybe here, those facing the challenges of rising housing costs,
[3166.04 --> 3173.56]  those, Lord, who are homeless, and the displaced around the world, the hundreds of thousands of refugees,
[3174.36 --> 3180.94]  especially those, Lord, now who are becoming refugees, who were refugees in Palestine.
[3180.94 --> 3182.26]  Lord, may we thank you for the time.
[3182.26 --> 3189.02]  We thank you that you have shared these experiences in the life of your son who was laid in a manger,
[3190.46 --> 3194.64]  then who was a refugee in Egypt in the first years of his life,
[3194.64 --> 3202.60]  and in his ministry said to his disciples who would follow him that the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
[3202.60 --> 3207.00]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3208.76 --> 3211.50]  And Lord, our hearts are heavy with the suffering of the world.
[3211.62 --> 3217.88]  We remember those who are innocent, who are killed by war or violence.
[3218.56 --> 3221.94]  Lord, we lift up to you this morning the persecuted church,
[3221.94 --> 3225.82]  our brothers, our sisters in Christ around the world,
[3226.08 --> 3232.28]  who are being imprisoned and suffer for the name of the true King.
[3234.46 --> 3241.04]  We pray for all those who experience what your son also shared when he was born under the reign of King Herod,
[3241.64 --> 3245.68]  who is himself imprisoned,
[3246.18 --> 3250.16]  who himself suffered by political violence.
[3250.16 --> 3253.88]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3254.78 --> 3258.36]  So we thank you, Lord, for coming to light our darkness,
[3258.58 --> 3261.78]  for opening the doors to heaven,
[3262.08 --> 3264.72]  making a way for us to eternal life.
[3265.50 --> 3269.94]  We thank you for the power that you gave us through your son Jesus
[3269.94 --> 3271.52]  to become children of God,
[3272.14 --> 3273.38]  children of the living Father,
[3273.46 --> 3275.34]  and we can't, Lord, do that ourselves.
[3276.18 --> 3277.94]  So we ask that you would come to us,
[3278.04 --> 3279.84]  open the doors of our hearts,
[3280.16 --> 3283.88]  cast away the darkness of sin in our lives,
[3283.88 --> 3285.94]  help us to see the kingdom of God.
[3286.48 --> 3288.58]  And that is only done by your grace,
[3288.90 --> 3290.96]  because you loved us first.
[3293.60 --> 3296.50]  And Lord, we pray all of these things this morning,
[3296.78 --> 3300.50]  sharing in the prayer that you taught your disciples so long ago,
[3300.50 --> 3305.54]  and that we say now together with all of the saints around the world this morning,
[3306.28 --> 3308.46]  our Father, who art in heaven,
[3308.92 --> 3310.40]  hallowed be thy name.
[3310.88 --> 3312.12]  Thy kingdom come,
[3312.40 --> 3313.52]  thy will be done,
[3314.06 --> 3315.76]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[3316.34 --> 3318.80]  Give us this day our daily bread,
[3318.80 --> 3321.12]  and forgive us our trespasses,
[3321.12 --> 3324.72]  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[3324.72 --> 3327.22]  And lead us not into temptation,
[3327.58 --> 3329.52]  but deliver us from evil.
[3330.08 --> 3331.60]  For thine is the kingdom,
[3331.94 --> 3332.80]  and the power,
[3333.32 --> 3334.06]  and the glory,
[3334.60 --> 3336.06]  forever and ever.
[3336.64 --> 3337.26]  Amen.
[3337.26 --> 3344.16]  Now, what is our order?
[3344.80 --> 3347.18]  We actually have one more song to sing
[3347.18 --> 3349.08]  before the benediction.
[3349.20 --> 3350.08]  So please stand,
[3350.18 --> 3351.04]  and we will sing
[3351.04 --> 3355.30]  once in Royal David City,
[3356.04 --> 3357.14]  and then we'll have the benediction,
[3357.48 --> 3358.98]  and then we'll sing a final song.
[3358.98 --> 3388.96]  First sound of Ryntianram.
[3388.98 --> 3398.84]  Father, little baby, in an ancient forest land.
[3398.84 --> 3405.00]  Mary was the good, Father, one.
[3405.60 --> 3412.38]  Jesus, Lord, the little child.
[3412.38 --> 3425.38]  He came down to earth from heaven, who is not the Lord of all.
[3426.52 --> 3437.38]  And his shelter was our sail, and his slave was our soul.
[3437.38 --> 3451.36]  With the poor and meek and lowly, with the blest, our Savior holy.
[3454.32 --> 3466.58]  And our eyes are not shall see him, through his whole redeeming love.
[3466.58 --> 3478.58]  For that child, so dear and gentle, is our Lord, we can't allow.
[3479.94 --> 3492.58]  And he leads his children home, to the place where we have come.
[3492.58 --> 3494.58]  He leads his children home.
[3494.58 --> 3506.58]  Haunt him that holy stable, with the ox that's deadly by.
[3506.58 --> 3520.58]  We shall see the body of heaven, seven thoughts, when death are mine.
[3520.58 --> 3535.58]  There is you, the blue crown, our night stars with glowing light.
[3536.58 --> 3548.22]  So now as we prepare to go out, hear this good word.
[3548.58 --> 3550.96]  Receive God's blessing spoken over you.
[3551.04 --> 3552.20]  I invite you to hold out your hands.
[3553.16 --> 3563.34]  May the joy of the angels, the eagerness of the shepherds, the wonder of Mary, the peace of the Christ child be yours this Christmas.
[3563.34 --> 3571.06]  And the blessings of Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be upon you and remain with you now and forever.
[3571.60 --> 3571.84]  Amen.
[3572.66 --> 3578.96]  And as is our tradition, we will sing Erdzigad.
[3578.96 --> 3581.64]  That was terrible, but you know what it is.
[3581.64 --> 3584.96]  Thank you.
[3584.96 --> 3585.96]  Thank you.
[3585.96 --> 3594.72]  Amen.
[3594.72 --> 3595.36]  Amen.
[3595.36 --> 3596.44]  Amen.
[3596.48 --> 3597.10]  Amen.
[3597.10 --> 3597.72]  Amen.
[3597.78 --> 3598.24]  Amen.
[3598.24 --> 3600.14]  Amen.
[3600.14 --> 3601.88]  Amen.
[3601.88 --> 3603.72]  Amen.
[3603.76 --> 3604.70]  Amen.
[3604.70 --> 3604.72]  Amen.
[3604.72 --> 3606.66]  Amen.
[3606.66 --> 3608.18]  Amen.
[3608.18 --> 3608.46]  Amen.
[3608.46 --> 3610.62]  Amen.
[3610.62 --> 3611.88]  Amen.
[3611.88 --> 3612.60]  Amen.
[3612.60 --> 3613.52]  Amen.
[3613.52 --> 3642.52]  Be Applaus
[3643.52 --> 3650.86]  In love, and the world I see.
[3653.86 --> 3661.28]  In Jesus' heart, in the heart.
[3661.28 --> 3671.32]  In Jesus' heart, in the heart.
[3673.52 --> 3682.96]  In Jesus' heart, in the heart.
[3682.96 --> 3690.96]  In the heart, in the heart.
[3690.96 --> 3708.96]  Give me your glory to the mercy, to the mercy, and the mercy of the Lord.
[3708.96 --> 3721.96]  And the mercy of the Lord, and the mercy of the Lord.
[3721.96 --> 3744.96]  Give me your glory to the Lord, and the mercy of the Lord.
[3744.96 --> 3746.96]  Amen.
[3774.96 --> 3776.96]  Amen.
[3776.96 --> 3778.96]  Amen.
[3778.96 --> 3780.96]  Amen.
[3804.96 --> 3806.96]  Amen.
[3834.96 --> 3836.96]  Amen.
