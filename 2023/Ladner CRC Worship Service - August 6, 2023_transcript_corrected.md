[11.98 → 17.00] 有人
[17.30 → 24.00] critical
[24.00 → 26.00] Amen.
[54.00 → 56.00] Amen.

[204.00 → 206.00] Amen.
[234.00 → 236.00] Amen.
[264.00 → 286.64] Good morning.
[286.64 → 288.64] Good morning.
[288.64 → 290.64] And welcome here today.
[290.64 → 293.78] Well, much of the world is out camping.
[293.78 → 295.26] We are here.
[295.26 → 299.98] And because of that, we have made things just a little simpler.
[299.98 → 304.60] Think of, you know, sitting around the campfire singing with one guitar.
[304.60 → 308.52] So much will be required of you this morning.
[308.52 → 309.82] So we're glad you're here.
[309.82 → 313.02] And also those who are joining us on a live stream, welcome.
[313.02 → 319.78] And we hope that one day you'll be able to join us again soon in person.
[319.78 → 325.68] It is a gift to be here together on this beautiful summer morning.
[326.52 → 329.18] My name is Marian, and I will be our worship leader this morning.
[330.62 → 337.58] Please join us for refreshments after the service in the fellowship hall so we can have a time
[337.58 → 343.14] of, yeah, just greeting each other and catching up with the events of our lives together.
[344.42 → 350.74] Pastor Jen Richards is from Tapestry Nights.
[351.54 → 354.78] I always want to say, well, Saturday nights at Tapestry.
[354.98 → 356.58] I always want to say Saturday night live.
[356.58 → 358.78] But it's, I'm sure it is live.
[359.48 → 360.92] Live and lively.
[361.78 → 364.44] She will be bringing the word to us later in the service.
[365.22 → 366.96] And we warmly welcome her.
[367.96 → 373.32] She is associate pastor there at the campus, as I said, for Saturday night.
[373.46 → 376.48] And this is her first time at Ladder CRC.
[376.74 → 379.56] So we're glad you're here, Pastor Jen.
[379.56 → 388.12] She graduated with a Master of Divinity from Regent College last year in 2022 and will be ordained
[388.12 → 390.36] in the Christian Reformed Church this fall.
[390.74 → 395.98] So a good reason to go to classes northwest this fall to see that take place.
[398.26 → 405.04] Jen lives in Richmond and enjoys cooking, walking by the water, and all and every kind of ice cream.
[405.04 → 409.10] So I apologize in advance that we have coffee and not ice cream after the service, Jen.
[409.18 → 410.48] But, you know, maybe next time.
[410.58 → 410.98] Who knows?
[412.84 → 423.22] Our call to worship today is from Matthew 18, verse 20, where we read,
[423.22 → 428.10] For where two or three gather in my name, there I am with them.
[429.20 → 434.86] And if that were not true, then there would not be a lot of point in us being here today.
[436.04 → 445.24] But, as God keeps his promises, he is here with us today as we focus our hearts and thoughts on him in worship.
[446.16 → 449.74] I'm going to pray a prayer of adoration that I ask you to join me in,
[449.74 → 454.20] and then we will end that with a short worship song.
[454.98 → 455.54] Let's pray.
[455.54 → 456.54] Let's pray.
[456.54 → 457.54] Let's pray.
[457.54 → 458.54] Let's pray.
[458.54 → 459.54] Let's pray.
[459.94 → 460.46] Gentle Saviour,
[461.02 → 462.14] a comforting spirit.
[463.04 → 464.26] You are all we need.
[464.94 → 472.30] You are holy, majestic, just, righteous, gracious, and so much more.
[473.26 → 475.42] We think we know what those words mean,
[475.42 → 480.44] but even these descriptions of you can never give full credence to who you really are.
[481.24 → 484.30] As we consider you the great I am,
[484.76 → 489.32] we are awestruck by your promise to be here among us and to delight in us.
[490.06 → 495.58] May our hearts, too, delight in you, not just this morning, but always.
[496.40 → 500.74] Accept our love and worship now as we lift our voices to you.
[505.42 → 510.70] We worship and adore thee,
[511.48 → 515.82] bowing down before thee,
[516.52 → 519.88] songs of praises singing,
[521.60 → 524.80] hallelujahs ringing.
[524.80 → 534.80] Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[535.42 → 540.42] Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[541.48 → 544.36] Amen.
[544.36 → 556.18] Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[556.18 → 561.18] Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[565.12 → 565.68] Amen.
[568.68 → 571.54] Would you rise for God's greeting, please?
[571.54 → 577.28] It's taken from Zephaniah 3, verse 17.
[577.60 → 579.36] Just a beautiful greeting.
[580.36 → 582.64] The Lord your God is with you.
[583.48 → 585.28] He is mighty to save.
[586.08 → 588.14] He will take great delight in you.
[589.04 → 591.28] He will quiet you with his love.
[591.28 → 594.36] He will rejoice over you with singing.
[595.12 → 596.70] As God has greeted us,
[596.88 → 598.28] let's take a moment to greet one another.
[598.28 → 598.58] Wow.
[599.28 → 601.00] Thank you.
[605.12 → 605.60] Okay.
[607.22 → 607.90] Good.
[608.12 → 608.42] Good.
[608.62 → 609.22] Good.
[609.22 → 610.42] Good.
[610.44 → 611.28] Good.
[611.28 → 611.68] Good.
[611.68 → 611.76] Good.
[611.78 → 612.34] Good.
[612.34 → 612.76] Good.
[613.28 → 613.96] Good.
[614.02 → 614.98] Good.
[614.98 → 615.30] Good.
[615.40 → 616.32] Good.
[616.42 → 617.00] Good.
[617.00 → 617.24] Good.
[617.36 → 617.78] Good.
[617.78 → 618.28] Good.
[618.28 → 618.42] I
[628.28 → 648.24] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[648.24 → 650.24] We will wait upon the Lord.
[650.24 → 652.42] We will wait upon the Lord.
[653.18 → 656.44] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[656.44 → 658.58] We will wait upon the Lord.
[658.58 → 662.28] We will wait upon the Lord our God.
[662.78 → 666.60] You reign forever.
[667.80 → 675.30] Our hope, our strong deliverer.
[675.30 → 680.56] You are the everlasting God.
[681.04 → 684.58] The everlasting God.
[684.58 → 691.02] You do not think you won't grow weary.
[692.02 → 696.74] You're the defender of the weak.
[697.34 → 700.56] You comfort those in need.
[700.56 → 708.00] You lift us up on wings like eagles.
[716.00 → 719.50] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[719.50 → 721.58] We will wait upon the Lord.
[721.58 → 723.62] We will wait upon the Lord.
[723.62 → 727.74] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[727.74 → 729.70] We will wait upon the Lord.
[729.70 → 731.74] We will wait upon the Lord.
[731.74 → 733.34] Our God.
[733.74 → 737.68] You reign forever.
[737.68 → 745.58] Our hope, our strong deliverer.
[745.58 → 752.02] You are the everlasting God.
[752.02 → 755.02] The everlasting God.
[755.02 → 762.02] You do not think you won't grow weary.
[762.02 → 767.46] You are the defender of the weak.
[767.46 → 771.46] You comfort those in need.
[771.46 → 779.46] You lift us up on wings like eagles.
[779.46 → 780.32] You have the everlasting God.
[789.68 → 793.66] We will wait upon the Lord.
[793.66 → 794.08] Although, come before the Lord.
[794.14 → 795.00] We will wait upon the Lord.
[795.00 → 797.30] And we had a little glitch in our PowerPoint.
[797.50 → 798.84] We're missing the third song.
[799.36 → 803.78] So I'm going to go right into the chorus of Here I Am to Worship.
[804.02 → 807.04] And I know that you know it, so you can sing it with me after this song.
[807.28 → 808.14] I know you know it.
[808.14 → 819.76] We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[819.76 → 826.76] In grateful devotion our tribute we bring.
[827.78 → 831.20] We lay it before you.
[831.54 → 834.86] We kneel and adore you.
[835.26 → 838.94] We bless your holy name.
[839.06 → 842.28] That praises we sing.
[842.28 → 851.96] We worship you, God, of our fathers and mothers.
[852.44 → 859.30] Through life's hope and death, the sky-high you have been.
[859.92 → 867.20] When perils partake us, you never forsake us.
[867.20 → 875.22] And with your help, O Lord, our battles we win.
[876.88 → 884.06] With voices united, our praises we offer.
[884.54 → 891.70] Our songs of Thanksgiving to you, we now raise.
[891.70 → 895.72] Your strong will guide us.
[896.04 → 899.60] Our God is beside us.
[899.94 → 908.70] To you, our great Redeemer, for every praise.
[910.86 → 913.28] Here I am to worship.
[913.88 → 916.54] Here I am to bow down.
[916.54 → 921.94] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[921.94 → 925.00] You're altogether lovely.
[925.64 → 927.90] Altogether worthy.
[928.54 → 932.86] Altogether wonderful to me.
[934.24 → 940.14] And I'll never know how much it cost
[940.14 → 945.66] To see my sin upon that cross.
[945.66 → 951.36] And I'll never know how much it cost
[951.36 → 958.28] To see my sin upon that cross.
[958.28 → 961.82] So here I am to worship.
[962.32 → 965.22] Here I am to bow down.
[965.22 → 970.62] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[971.18 → 974.22] You're altogether lovely.
[975.24 → 977.22] Altogether worthy.
[978.36 → 982.82] Altogether wonderful to me.
[985.82 → 986.90] You may be seated.
[986.90 → 990.60] It's not a bad exercise sometimes
[990.60 → 992.62] To sing songs without words, is it?
[993.38 → 994.58] You did a very good job.
[994.82 → 997.38] Thank you for indulging me with that.
[998.82 → 1000.12] As we just sang,
[1001.82 → 1005.62] The cost for our sin is greater than we'll ever know.
[1006.52 → 1008.06] And so we show our gratitude
[1008.06 → 1010.48] By being honest with ourselves
[1010.48 → 1013.36] And with God about who we are
[1013.36 → 1015.62] As we come to him in confession.
[1015.62 → 1017.42] Let's pray together.
[1020.14 → 1022.98] Holy God, we are unholy.
[1023.76 → 1026.48] We are far from what you intend us to be.
[1027.16 → 1029.94] You invite us to confess our weakness to you.
[1030.78 → 1032.28] And so we say with the psalmist,
[1032.78 → 1035.18] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[1036.00 → 1038.26] Test me and know my thoughts.
[1039.30 → 1041.48] See if there is any wicked way in me
[1041.48 → 1044.00] And lead me in the way everlasting.
[1044.00 → 1047.50] Dear Lord, these words leave us vulnerable
[1047.50 → 1050.50] For we know we cannot pass the test of your holiness.
[1051.36 → 1054.24] We confess that we have been often selfish,
[1054.82 → 1057.46] Jealous, unloving, and callous
[1057.46 → 1059.68] In our attitudes towards you and others.
[1060.48 → 1063.88] We have hurt you, others, and ourselves.
[1064.74 → 1066.52] We have hurt the ones you love.
[1067.54 → 1069.20] Forgive us now for these sins.
[1069.20 → 1072.56] Form us into your image more and more
[1072.56 → 1074.38] By your transforming spirit
[1074.38 → 1076.82] And through the powerful name of Jesus.
[1077.58 → 1078.02] Amen.
[1079.70 → 1083.46] We have a responsive reading
[1083.46 → 1084.70] That will be on the screen
[1084.70 → 1086.34] For our assurance of pardon.
[1086.34 → 1090.12] There is therefore now
[1090.12 → 1092.26] No condemnation for those
[1092.26 → 1093.62] Who are in Christ Jesus.
[1094.34 → 1095.70] If the spirit of him
[1095.70 → 1097.28] Who raised Jesus from the dead
[1097.28 → 1098.32] Dwells in you
[1098.32 → 1100.84] He who raised Christ from the dead
[1100.84 → 1103.60] Will give life to your mortal bodies
[1103.60 → 1105.42] Also through his spirit
[1105.42 → 1107.06] That dwells in you.
[1108.12 → 1111.30] For all who are led by the spirit of God
[1111.30 → 1113.02] Are children of God.
[1113.02 → 1116.76] For you did not receive a spirit of slavery
[1116.76 → 1119.04] To fall back into fear
[1119.04 → 1122.70] But you have received a spirit of adoption.
[1123.62 → 1125.92] When we cry, Abba, Father
[1125.92 → 1128.32] It is the very spirit
[1128.32 → 1130.70] Bearing witness with our spirit
[1130.70 → 1133.40] That we are children of God.
[1134.18 → 1135.80] Alleluia. Amen.
[1135.80 → 1136.00] Amen.
[1136.00 → 1138.00] Amen.
[1152.74 → 1154.66] Amen.
[1154.66 → 1158.22] And can it be
[1158.22 → 1162.44] That I should gain
[1162.44 → 1170.88] An interest in the Saviour's blood
[1170.88 → 1179.86] Died he for me who caused his pain
[1179.86 → 1188.88] For me who caused his bitter death
[1188.88 → 1196.88] Amazing love, how can it be
[1196.88 → 1207.24] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1207.24 → 1216.90] He left his Father's throne above
[1216.90 → 1224.90] So free, so infinite his grace
[1225.98 → 1234.22] Emptied himself of all but love
[1234.22 → 1243.24] And bled for Adam's selfless grace
[1243.24 → 1251.24] What mercy this immense and free
[1251.24 → 1260.24] For, oh my God, it found out me
[1260.24 → 1268.24] Amazing love, how can it be
[1268.24 → 1277.24] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1277.24 → 1280.18] Would you rise for the last verses of this?
[1280.46 → 1282.72] I just feel like we should be standing up for this song
[1282.72 → 1292.68] Long my imprisoned spirit lay
[1292.68 → 1300.68] Past bound in sin and nature's night
[1300.68 → 1309.68] Your sunrise turned that night to day
[1309.68 → 1317.68] I woke the dungeon flamed with light
[1317.68 → 1325.68] My chains fell off, your voice I knew
[1325.68 → 1334.68] I rose, went out, and followed you
[1334.68 → 1344.68] No condemnation now I dread
[1344.68 → 1353.68] For Christ and all in him is mine
[1353.68 → 1361.68] Alive in him my living head
[1361.68 → 1370.68] And clothed in righteousness divine
[1370.68 → 1378.68] Bold I approach the eternal throne
[1378.68 → 1387.68] And claim the crown through Christ my own
[1387.68 → 1396.68] Amazing love, how can it be
[1396.68 → 1406.68] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1406.68 → 1409.18] You may be seated
[1409.18 → 1412.86] And if we have any children here
[1412.86 → 1415.86] Ages three to kindergarten
[1415.86 → 1419.66] You are dismissed for kids' life
[1419.66 → 1423.66] And I just have a question
[1423.66 → 1425.74] Was anyone who was here this morning
[1425.74 → 1427.42] Asked to read scripture this morning or no?
[1429.62 → 1431.76] Okay, so Pastor Jen
[1431.76 → 1432.94] Thank you for coming up
[1432.94 → 1434.00] And doing that for us as well
[1434.00 → 1443.80] Good morning
[1443.80 → 1445.62] Our reading from scripture today
[1445.62 → 1447.24] Is found in Psalm 16
[1447.24 → 1449.18] It's page 405
[1449.18 → 1452.42] In your hymn pew Bible
[1452.42 → 1453.86] If you would like to turn there
[1453.86 → 1455.70] You are welcome to do so
[1455.70 → 1462.00] Psalm 16
[1462.00 → 1465.76] Keep me safe, my God
[1465.76 → 1468.50] For in you, I take refuge
[1468.50 → 1470.46] I say to the Lord
[1470.46 → 1471.64] You are my Lord
[1471.64 → 1474.06] Apart from you, I have no good thing
[1474.06 → 1476.30] I say of the holy people
[1476.30 → 1477.42] Who are in the land
[1477.42 → 1479.28] They are the noble ones
[1479.28 → 1481.70] In who is all my delight
[1481.70 → 1484.48] Those who run after other gods
[1484.48 → 1486.42] Will suffer more and more
[1486.42 → 1489.52] I will not pour libations of blood
[1489.52 → 1490.68] To such gods
[1490.68 → 1493.46] Or take up their names on my lips
[1493.46 → 1496.28] Lord, you alone are my portion
[1496.28 → 1497.40] And my cup
[1497.40 → 1499.54] You make my lot secure
[1499.54 → 1502.30] The boundary lines have fallen for me
[1502.30 → 1504.08] In pleasant places
[1504.08 → 1507.00] Surely I have a delightful inheritance
[1507.00 → 1509.74] I will praise the Lord
[1509.74 → 1510.68] Who counsels me
[1510.68 → 1511.76] Even at night
[1511.76 → 1513.50] My heart instructs me
[1513.50 → 1516.50] I keep my eyes always on the Lord
[1516.50 → 1518.44] With him at my right hand
[1518.44 → 1519.70] I will not be shaken
[1519.70 → 1522.00] Therefore my heart is glad
[1522.00 → 1523.48] And my tongue rejoices
[1523.48 → 1526.38] My body also will rest secure
[1526.38 → 1528.58] Because you will not abandon me
[1528.58 → 1530.90] To the realm of the dead
[1530.90 → 1533.42] Nor will you let your faithful ones see decay
[1533.42 → 1536.32] You make known to me the path of life
[1536.32 → 1538.42] You fill me with joy in your presence
[1538.42 → 1541.54] With eternal pleasures at your right hand
[1541.54 → 1543.36] This is the word of the Lord
[1543.36 → 1545.94] Excellent
[1545.94 → 1548.00] Well good morning again to you all
[1548.00 → 1549.38] As has been said
[1549.38 → 1550.36] My name is Jen
[1550.36 → 1551.86] I have never
[1551.86 → 1554.80] I'm a pastor at the church in Richmond
[1554.80 → 1556.62] The CRC church called the Tapestry
[1556.62 → 1559.78] I'm part of their Saturday night campus
[1559.78 → 1562.26] And it's a pleasure to be here
[1562.26 → 1564.50] I've never been to Latin or CRC before
[1564.50 → 1567.34] But I know Pastor Al Chu
[1567.34 → 1568.30] He often comes
[1568.30 → 1570.74] If you recognize the name Michael Yang
[1570.74 → 1572.20] He is the campus pastor
[1572.20 → 1574.06] Who's part of the site I'm part of
[1574.06 → 1576.10] So if that makes a connection for you
[1576.10 → 1576.72] That's great
[1576.72 → 1579.26] And so they speak fondly of this congregation
[1579.26 → 1581.54] So I'm excited to worship with you today
[1581.54 → 1583.56] And to be able to open God's word
[1583.56 → 1585.04] As was just read
[1585.04 → 1587.28] Our passage today is Psalm 16
[1587.28 → 1589.22] And as we dive into this
[1589.22 → 1590.12] I need to let you know
[1590.12 → 1592.76] That I have a complex relationship
[1592.76 → 1594.52] With the Psalms
[1594.52 → 1595.98] And the main reason for it
[1595.98 → 1597.42] Is because of the genre
[1597.42 → 1599.34] Of the writing of the Psalms
[1599.34 → 1601.60] The Psalms is a book of poetry
[1601.60 → 1606.14] And I am so not a poetry person
[1606.14 → 1608.40] I am a story person
[1608.40 → 1609.72] I love movies
[1609.72 → 1611.08] And reading fiction
[1611.08 → 1612.54] And reading non-fiction
[1612.54 → 1614.58] All within the realm of the genre
[1614.58 → 1615.36] Of stories
[1615.36 → 1616.72] And the arc of a narrative
[1616.72 → 1619.64] I have always found the same answer
[1619.64 → 1620.22] When someone asks
[1620.22 → 1621.18] Well do you want the long version
[1621.18 → 1622.58] Or short version of this story
[1622.58 → 1623.78] Always the long version
[1623.78 → 1625.08] Always the long version
[1625.08 → 1627.30] So I generally don't get poetry
[1627.30 → 1628.74] And what they do
[1628.74 → 1630.54] But the Psalms
[1630.54 → 1631.96] The Psalms at times
[1631.96 → 1634.08] I strangely get
[1634.08 → 1636.04] Or rather I should say
[1636.04 → 1638.38] The Psalms strangely get me
[1638.38 → 1640.64] I feel seen and known
[1640.64 → 1643.02] In the words of many of the Psalms
[1643.02 → 1643.96] And through it then
[1643.96 → 1645.00] I encounter a God
[1645.00 → 1645.80] Who sees me
[1645.80 → 1646.58] And knows me
[1646.58 → 1647.42] And loves me
[1647.42 → 1649.12] Through this form of poetry
[1649.12 → 1650.66] That at times
[1650.66 → 1651.34] Dare I say
[1651.34 → 1652.78] Narrative and story
[1652.78 → 1653.38] And scripture
[1653.38 → 1655.18] Can't quite do
[1655.18 → 1656.96] The Psalms invite
[1657.52 → 1658.22] An authentic
[1658.22 → 1660.34] And personal interaction
[1660.34 → 1661.54] With God
[1661.54 → 1662.94] And so to hold true
[1662.94 → 1663.96] To this characteristic
[1663.96 → 1665.08] Of a poetry
[1665.08 → 1666.08] And the genre
[1666.08 → 1667.74] That the Psalms lead us into
[1667.74 → 1668.56] We are
[1668.56 → 1669.10] I'm going to
[1669.10 → 1669.36] Today
[1669.36 → 1670.36] I'm going to teach
[1670.36 → 1670.96] And exegete
[1670.96 → 1673.16] This Psalm for us
[1673.16 → 1674.22] But I'm going to do so
[1674.22 → 1674.86] Purposely
[1674.86 → 1676.84] With a personal slant
[1676.84 → 1677.82] More personal maybe
[1677.82 → 1679.26] Than if we looked at an epistle
[1679.26 → 1680.50] Or we looked at other
[1680.50 → 1682.58] Genre of our scriptures
[1682.58 → 1684.36] Because in doing so
[1684.36 → 1685.22] I feel there's something
[1685.22 → 1686.38] Powerful both about
[1686.38 → 1687.40] Leaning into
[1687.40 → 1688.76] The personalness
[1688.76 → 1689.80] That this genre
[1689.80 → 1691.24] Of poetry invites
[1691.24 → 1692.70] And that David invites
[1692.70 → 1694.40] In writing this Psalm
[1694.40 → 1695.78] But also there's something
[1695.78 → 1697.12] Powerful about being
[1697.12 → 1698.46] Personal about
[1698.46 → 1699.42] Scripture
[1699.42 → 1701.70] Especially a genre
[1701.70 → 1703.08] That invites this whole
[1703.08 → 1704.08] Human self
[1704.08 → 1705.18] In scripture
[1705.18 → 1706.64] And yet when I say
[1706.64 → 1707.58] I'm about to be personal
[1707.58 → 1709.48] More maybe than other genres
[1709.48 → 1711.08] It's actually not novel
[1711.08 → 1711.98] To be personal
[1711.98 → 1712.84] Is it?
[1713.12 → 1714.32] Our culture is all
[1714.32 → 1715.72] About being personal
[1715.72 → 1716.96] For example
[1716.96 → 1718.14] I'm currently in a phase
[1718.14 → 1719.38] Of loving listening
[1719.38 → 1720.24] On audiobook
[1720.24 → 1721.82] To memoirs
[1721.82 → 1723.12] Especially if the author
[1723.12 → 1724.44] Is doing the reading
[1724.44 → 1725.12] Of the memoir
[1725.12 → 1726.68] I've realized though
[1726.68 → 1727.46] I will like literally
[1727.46 → 1729.98] Listen to anyone's story
[1729.98 → 1731.92] If the story is done well
[1731.92 → 1733.18] And I think it's because
[1733.18 → 1734.64] There's this personal element
[1734.64 → 1735.64] Of it
[1735.64 → 1737.06] I love the personalness
[1737.06 → 1737.52] For example
[1737.52 → 1738.60] I'm not a diehard
[1738.60 → 1740.28] Marvel movie fan
[1740.28 → 1741.32] If any diehard fans
[1741.32 → 1742.24] Please don't judge me
[1742.24 → 1742.88] For that
[1742.88 → 1744.78] But I recently flew
[1744.78 → 1746.24] Through Marvel actor
[1746.24 → 1748.14] Simu Liu's memoir
[1748.14 → 1749.92] Called We Were Dreamers
[1749.92 → 1750.86] I notice it's currently
[1750.86 → 1751.78] Even the Richmond
[1751.78 → 1753.16] See Richmond's book
[1753.16 → 1753.98] Of the month
[1753.98 → 1755.60] It's a memoir
[1755.60 → 1757.66] And the memoir genre
[1757.66 → 1758.64] Is just a tip
[1758.64 → 1760.02] Of our culture's love
[1760.02 → 1761.06] Of getting personal
[1761.06 → 1762.62] If you can even call it that
[1762.62 → 1764.06] There are documentaries
[1764.06 → 1766.66] About 19 kids and counting
[1766.66 → 1767.74] And the drama
[1767.74 → 1769.92] That unfolds in their home
[1769.92 → 1771.16] There are tours
[1771.16 → 1772.92] Of famous people's bathrooms
[1772.92 → 1775.72] There's endless Instagram feeds
[1775.72 → 1777.02] Of behind the scenes
[1777.02 → 1778.32] Of literally anything
[1778.32 → 1780.42] But the thing is
[1780.42 → 1781.80] When I engage with these
[1781.80 → 1782.46] Be it watching
[1782.46 → 1783.24] Or reading
[1783.24 → 1786.06] I do so with a step back
[1786.06 → 1787.78] As an intrigue
[1787.78 → 1788.62] Of what I'm watching
[1788.62 → 1789.70] Or what I'm engaging with
[1789.70 → 1790.46] Because my life
[1790.46 → 1792.22] Is nothing like these stories
[1792.22 → 1793.34] That I'm reading
[1793.34 → 1794.26] And listening to
[1794.26 → 1795.54] Especially memoirs
[1795.54 → 1796.84] Especially any type of things
[1796.84 → 1797.90] That our culture
[1797.90 → 1799.04] Is engaged with right now
[1799.04 → 1800.28] And label personal
[1800.28 → 1802.40] I engage with all of them
[1802.40 → 1803.28] Then with the mindset
[1803.28 → 1804.76] That this is a story
[1804.76 → 1807.30] Like he or she belongs to
[1807.30 → 1810.34] And yet there's a liturgical line
[1810.34 → 1812.84] That we use at the Tapestry Church
[1812.84 → 1815.42] Specifically the Saturday Night Live
[1815.42 → 1815.88] Love it
[1815.88 → 1817.30] Idea
[1817.30 → 1818.80] When we say scripture
[1818.80 → 1820.04] When we about read scripture
[1820.04 → 1820.96] At our service
[1820.96 → 1822.24] Just before the scripture
[1822.24 → 1824.50] For a given sermon is read
[1824.50 → 1826.08] The scripture reader says
[1826.08 → 1826.76] Church
[1826.76 → 1829.14] Hear a reading from the story
[1829.14 → 1830.84] We belong to
[1830.84 → 1833.24] And then reads that passage
[1833.24 → 1834.06] For the day
[1834.06 → 1835.48] So this morning
[1835.48 → 1837.16] You will hear from one person
[1837.16 → 1837.94] In the
[1837.94 → 1840.18] The story we belong to
[1840.18 → 1841.92] One person who's been impacted
[1841.92 → 1843.40] By a specific psalm
[1843.40 → 1845.06] In the story of God
[1845.06 → 1846.66] But my prayer is that
[1846.66 → 1847.34] In the hearing
[1847.34 → 1848.82] May you find yourself
[1848.82 → 1849.84] In the story
[1849.84 → 1850.74] May it not be
[1850.74 → 1851.54] Oh there's a story
[1851.54 → 1852.76] She belongs to
[1852.76 → 1854.76] May you find yourself
[1854.76 → 1855.94] In the story
[1855.94 → 1857.48] We belong to
[1857.48 → 1859.36] Despite what your relationship
[1859.36 → 1860.38] Is with God
[1860.38 → 1861.52] If it is very new
[1861.52 → 1862.54] If it is unsure
[1862.54 → 1864.00] If it's on rocky ground
[1864.00 → 1865.70] If it is very seasoned
[1865.70 → 1867.40] May you find yourself
[1867.40 → 1868.10] In the
[1868.10 → 1869.98] And, so I chose
[1869.98 → 1871.38] The passage of psalm 16
[1871.38 → 1872.12] This morning
[1872.12 → 1873.72] But in real life
[1873.72 → 1874.74] I would claim more
[1874.74 → 1875.58] That this psalm
[1875.58 → 1877.14] Keeps choosing me
[1877.14 → 1878.36] But it does so
[1878.36 → 1879.32] In a very specific
[1879.32 → 1880.96] Aspect of my life
[1880.96 → 1882.54] An aspect that's true
[1882.54 → 1884.14] I'd say for all humans
[1884.14 → 1886.20] In particular ways
[1886.20 → 1887.24] And that is
[1887.24 → 1888.76] As I live my life
[1888.76 → 1890.44] I keep being surprised
[1890.44 → 1893.16] How life doesn't turn out
[1893.16 → 1895.68] How I would expect
[1895.68 → 1896.66] It would have
[1896.66 → 1899.70] Life keeps not meeting
[1899.70 → 1901.18] My expectations
[1901.18 → 1903.92] This is true in good ways
[1903.92 → 1905.96] There are aspects of my season
[1905.96 → 1906.80] Of life now
[1906.80 → 1908.06] And it keeps being true
[1908.06 → 1909.28] Where my past self
[1909.28 → 1910.62] That would look
[1910.62 → 1911.96] And I would be shocked
[1911.96 → 1913.10] Of how rich
[1913.10 → 1914.32] Certain elements
[1914.32 → 1916.06] Of my current life are
[1916.06 → 1917.36] And how beautiful
[1917.36 → 1919.20] And meaningful they are
[1919.20 → 1920.04] So for example
[1920.04 → 1921.30] I am an aunt
[1921.30 → 1922.46] To a five-year-old
[1922.46 → 1923.54] And three-year-old girls
[1923.54 → 1924.86] Here's a picture of them
[1924.86 → 1925.92] Living their best life
[1925.92 → 1927.00] On a BC ferry
[1927.00 → 1928.44] A few weeks ago
[1928.44 → 1929.88] And I've been shocked
[1929.88 → 1930.72] With how much joy
[1930.72 → 1932.14] These two little humans
[1932.14 → 1933.76] Just in their very existence
[1933.76 → 1935.26] On this planet
[1935.26 → 1936.52] Bring me joy
[1936.52 → 1937.22] I have it
[1937.22 → 1938.30] On good authority
[1938.30 → 1939.54] That the five-year-old
[1939.54 → 1940.76] Wonders if maybe
[1940.76 → 1942.38] I have memory problems
[1942.38 → 1944.34] Because I will ask her
[1944.34 → 1945.70] On a series of hangouts
[1945.70 → 1946.60] Over and over again
[1946.60 → 1948.76] Various questions
[1948.76 → 1949.92] And the same ones
[1949.92 → 1951.06] Over and over again
[1951.06 → 1952.00] Of like what again
[1952.00 → 1952.94] Were you for Halloween
[1952.94 → 1953.76] Last year
[1953.76 → 1954.98] What did you dress up as
[1954.98 → 1956.18] Or what are your friends
[1956.18 → 1957.06] Right now in preschool
[1957.06 → 1958.54] What are their names again
[1958.54 → 1959.74] And it's not because
[1959.74 → 1961.04] I forget the answers
[1961.04 → 1962.38] But because I love
[1962.38 → 1964.16] Hearing her tell me
[1964.16 → 1965.52] About her life
[1965.52 → 1967.48] That's just one way
[1967.48 → 1968.96] Of the many ways
[1968.96 → 1970.58] That there is such joy
[1970.58 → 1972.80] And delight in my life
[1972.80 → 1973.60] And that I wouldn't
[1973.60 → 1974.30] Have predicted
[1974.30 → 1976.24] Then just like you
[1976.24 → 1977.56] There are aspects of my life
[1977.56 → 1978.48] That are disappointing
[1978.48 → 1980.04] And more painful
[1980.04 → 1981.30] Than I would have expected
[1981.30 → 1982.96] Again in big
[1982.96 → 1984.10] And small ways
[1984.10 → 1985.58] There's a disappointment
[1985.58 → 1987.12] Like on the grand sweep
[1987.12 → 1987.86] Of life
[1987.86 → 1989.70] And in the everydayness
[1989.70 → 1990.86] Of life
[1990.86 → 1992.96] And so in this reality
[1992.96 → 1994.18] Of unexpectedness
[1994.18 → 1995.36] Both the beauty of it
[1995.36 → 1997.30] And the brokenness of it
[1997.30 → 1998.84] God has chosen
[1998.84 → 2000.08] To speak to me
[2000.08 → 2001.44] In the particularities
[2001.44 → 2002.20] Of that aspect
[2002.20 → 2003.22] In my life
[2003.22 → 2004.60] Through the words
[2004.60 → 2005.68] Of Psalm 16
[2005.68 → 2007.68] So as we explore
[2007.68 → 2008.38] This psalm
[2008.38 → 2009.92] As a whole this morning
[2009.92 → 2011.12] I'll bear witness
[2011.12 → 2012.12] To the power of it
[2012.12 → 2013.22] In my own life
[2013.22 → 2014.54] And there's one word
[2014.54 → 2015.22] We're going to
[2015.22 → 2017.50] Guide our conversation
[2017.50 → 2018.74] And our teaching today
[2018.74 → 2020.16] In this idea
[2020.16 → 2021.24] Of Psalm 16
[2021.24 → 2022.60] And that
[2022.60 → 2023.58] We're going to use
[2023.58 → 2025.26] The word of delight
[2025.26 → 2027.04] In our guiding
[2027.04 → 2028.78] The word delight
[2028.78 → 2029.60] Is shown up
[2029.60 → 2030.88] In the NIV translation
[2030.88 → 2031.80] Of Psalm 16
[2031.80 → 2032.78] Only twice
[2032.78 → 2034.30] But implicitly
[2034.30 → 2035.36] This whole psalm
[2035.36 → 2036.88] Paints a picture
[2036.88 → 2037.88] Of delight
[2037.88 → 2038.62] Delight
[2038.62 → 2039.40] And it's not just
[2039.40 → 2040.62] Like future delight
[2040.62 → 2041.60] Of delight
[2041.60 → 2042.42] Going to heaven
[2042.42 → 2043.40] As much as there is
[2043.40 → 2044.66] That hopeful delight
[2044.66 → 2045.68] It points to
[2045.68 → 2047.36] There's both the future
[2047.36 → 2048.12] But also
[2048.12 → 2049.72] There's this tangible
[2049.72 → 2051.10] Present delight
[2051.10 → 2051.90] This psalm
[2051.90 → 2054.02] Keeps drawing us into
[2054.02 → 2056.00] The author
[2056.00 → 2056.46] The author of Shawna
[2056.46 → 2057.00] Nyquist
[2057.00 → 2057.80] She reflects
[2057.80 → 2058.92] On the idea
[2058.92 → 2059.78] Of delight
[2059.78 → 2060.78] With words
[2060.78 → 2061.52] When I read them
[2061.52 → 2062.58] They deeply resounded
[2062.58 → 2063.06] With me
[2063.06 → 2063.68] She says
[2063.68 → 2065.36] One of my goals
[2065.36 → 2066.30] Is to be a person
[2066.30 → 2066.32] Is to be a person
[2066.32 → 2068.08] Who's easily delighted
[2068.08 → 2069.60] Who can find
[2069.60 → 2070.40] Great cause
[2070.40 → 2071.62] For celebration
[2071.62 → 2072.62] In a fig
[2072.62 → 2074.54] Or familiar face
[2074.54 → 2075.98] I want to live
[2075.98 → 2076.84] With an extremely
[2076.84 → 2078.28] Low bar
[2078.28 → 2079.06] For delight
[2079.06 → 2080.76] Where it takes
[2080.76 → 2081.94] Almost nothing
[2081.94 → 2082.88] At all
[2082.88 → 2084.12] Oh man
[2084.12 → 2084.76] I also
[2084.76 → 2085.78] Want to be someone
[2085.78 → 2087.20] Who is easily delighted
[2087.20 → 2088.38] But I find
[2088.38 → 2089.36] The older I get
[2089.36 → 2090.30] And life continues
[2090.30 → 2091.66] To be unexpected
[2091.66 → 2093.66] My bar for delight
[2093.66 → 2094.40] Seems to creep
[2094.40 → 2095.90] Higher and higher
[2095.90 → 2097.46] Delight seems to come
[2097.46 → 2098.80] At like a higher price
[2098.80 → 2100.40] Or just feels exhausting
[2100.40 → 2102.00] To try to aim for
[2102.00 → 2104.04] And then I read
[2104.04 → 2104.82] Psalm 16
[2104.82 → 2106.80] And I see a picture
[2106.80 → 2107.50] Of delight
[2107.50 → 2109.28] That captivates me
[2109.28 → 2110.84] A picture of delight
[2110.84 → 2112.00] That is not detached
[2112.00 → 2113.62] From the things of God
[2113.62 → 2115.08] But intimately shaped
[2115.08 → 2116.98] By the things of God
[2116.98 → 2118.88] So let's look this morning
[2118.88 → 2120.44] At three specific elements
[2120.44 → 2121.44] Of the delight psalm
[2121.66 → 2122.74] 16 offers
[2122.74 → 2124.78] A delightful portion
[2124.78 → 2127.34] A delightful passiveness
[2127.34 → 2130.12] And a delightful people
[2130.12 → 2131.90] So first
[2131.90 → 2133.24] In the very centre
[2133.24 → 2134.02] Of the psalm
[2134.02 → 2134.98] David paints
[2134.98 → 2135.88] A picture
[2135.88 → 2137.58] Of the delightful portion
[2137.58 → 2139.30] God has given him
[2139.30 → 2141.12] Verses five to six
[2141.12 → 2141.90] They say this
[2141.90 → 2142.96] Lord you alone
[2142.96 → 2143.98] Are my portion
[2143.98 → 2145.42] And my cup
[2145.42 → 2147.60] You make my lot secure
[2147.60 → 2149.20] The boundary lines
[2149.20 → 2150.24] Have fallen for me
[2150.24 → 2151.60] In pleasant places
[2151.60 → 2154.16] Surely I have a delightful
[2154.16 → 2156.06] Inheritance
[2156.06 → 2158.16] I can't tell you
[2158.16 → 2158.84] How many times
[2158.84 → 2159.68] These two verses
[2159.68 → 2161.24] Have come to my mind
[2161.24 → 2163.24] Over these last few years
[2163.24 → 2164.92] That reinforce
[2164.92 → 2167.36] Both the beauty
[2167.36 → 2169.12] And the pain
[2169.12 → 2171.20] Of this unexpectedness
[2171.20 → 2171.92] Of life
[2171.92 → 2173.58] It comes in light
[2173.58 → 2174.48] Of beautiful gifts
[2174.48 → 2175.44] God has given me
[2175.44 → 2176.34] When I am filled
[2176.34 → 2177.18] With gratitude
[2177.18 → 2178.56] Several times
[2178.56 → 2180.02] These exact verses
[2180.02 → 2180.90] Have come to mind
[2180.90 → 2182.26] Lord you are my portion
[2182.26 → 2182.78] And my cup
[2182.78 → 2184.10] Look the boundary lines
[2184.10 → 2185.06] Have fallen for me
[2185.06 → 2187.12] In pleasant places
[2187.12 → 2188.90] That on the flip side
[2188.90 → 2190.06] I also at different times
[2190.06 → 2192.00] I find these two verses
[2192.00 → 2192.70] Particularly
[2192.70 → 2194.30] Slightly disturbing
[2194.30 → 2196.34] And mainly
[2196.34 → 2197.08] It is a series
[2197.08 → 2197.78] Of images
[2197.78 → 2198.88] David packs
[2198.88 → 2200.06] Into verse five
[2200.06 → 2201.10] That really
[2201.10 → 2202.46] Can get under my skin
[2202.46 → 2203.18] So let's look
[2203.18 → 2203.82] At these images
[2203.82 → 2204.98] So first
[2204.98 → 2206.08] The portion images
[2206.08 → 2207.32] That David uses
[2207.32 → 2207.92] Is first
[2207.92 → 2208.48] He just uses
[2208.48 → 2208.92] Right out
[2208.92 → 2209.50] Portion
[2209.50 → 2210.62] God you alone
[2210.62 → 2211.60] Are my portion
[2211.60 → 2213.02] So portion
[2213.02 → 2214.52] Just a portion
[2214.52 → 2215.92] So then I look
[2215.92 → 2216.86] Okay can I
[2216.86 → 2218.38] Supersize my portion
[2218.38 → 2219.92] What size of portion
[2219.92 → 2221.28] Do other people
[2221.28 → 2222.48] Have here
[2222.48 → 2223.60] Portion
[2223.60 → 2223.90] Okay
[2223.90 → 2225.30] And then you alone
[2225.30 → 2225.92] Are my portion
[2225.92 → 2227.08] And my cup
[2227.08 → 2228.38] Again but like
[2228.38 → 2229.46] What size of cup
[2229.46 → 2230.82] Are we talking about here
[2230.82 → 2231.96] It seems like
[2231.96 → 2232.90] Other people have
[2232.90 → 2234.06] Like whole thermoses
[2234.06 → 2235.24] Others like a jug
[2235.24 → 2236.74] Situation over here
[2236.74 → 2237.80] And I feel like
[2237.80 → 2238.40] I at times
[2238.40 → 2239.48] Have a paper cup
[2239.48 → 2240.58] That I have to hold
[2240.58 → 2241.46] Just right
[2241.46 → 2241.98] Or it's going to
[2241.98 → 2242.52] Crumble
[2242.52 → 2244.10] Before my eyes
[2244.10 → 2245.96] And if that's not enough
[2245.96 → 2247.16] Then he goes on
[2247.16 → 2247.98] To talk about
[2247.98 → 2249.18] Boundary lines
[2249.18 → 2250.62] And it's here
[2250.62 → 2251.54] That the really
[2251.54 → 2252.98] Starts to irk me
[2252.98 → 2254.90] The boundary lines
[2254.90 → 2255.46] David says
[2255.46 → 2256.90] Has fallen for me
[2256.90 → 2258.98] In pleasant places
[2258.98 → 2260.46] So my issue here
[2260.46 → 2261.98] Is the verb he uses
[2261.98 → 2263.14] Fallen
[2263.14 → 2264.24] I'm sorry
[2264.24 → 2265.68] I don't want anything
[2265.68 → 2266.66] Boundary lines
[2266.66 → 2267.26] Or otherwise
[2267.26 → 2268.82] Just to fall
[2268.82 → 2270.48] I want to blueprint
[2270.48 → 2271.32] Them out
[2271.32 → 2272.50] I want to study
[2272.50 → 2273.60] The different options
[2273.60 → 2274.50] That I could have
[2274.50 → 2275.20] I want to then
[2275.20 → 2276.86] Place them accordingly
[2276.86 → 2277.60] And be able to
[2277.60 → 2278.42] Adjust them
[2278.42 → 2279.46] Where needed
[2279.46 → 2280.70] I'm so not okay
[2280.70 → 2281.24] With anything
[2281.24 → 2282.72] Just falling
[2282.72 → 2285.46] And yet my disturbance
[2285.46 → 2287.40] With all of these images
[2287.40 → 2288.10] Cup
[2288.10 → 2289.32] Portion
[2289.32 → 2290.36] Boundary lines
[2290.36 → 2291.04] Falling
[2291.04 → 2292.98] They all reveal
[2292.98 → 2294.36] A fear
[2294.36 → 2295.82] That I have
[2295.82 → 2297.08] And it's not
[2297.08 → 2297.90] A surface fear
[2297.90 → 2298.80] It's a deep
[2298.80 → 2300.24] Deep fear
[2300.24 → 2301.74] It's a fear
[2301.74 → 2302.28] The Bible
[2302.28 → 2302.90] Addresses
[2302.90 → 2305.06] Over and over
[2305.06 → 2305.52] Again
[2305.52 → 2306.46] Which both
[2306.46 → 2306.90] Gives me
[2306.90 → 2307.68] Encouragement
[2307.68 → 2308.70] And also
[2308.70 → 2309.30] Keeps being
[2309.30 → 2309.98] Confronting
[2309.98 → 2311.86] It's a fear
[2311.86 → 2312.38] That can be
[2312.38 → 2312.88] Summed up
[2312.88 → 2313.62] In the question
[2313.62 → 2315.74] Can God
[2315.74 → 2316.78] Be trusted
[2316.78 → 2319.32] Can I trust
[2319.32 → 2320.18] That what I'm given
[2320.18 → 2322.34] And what I work for
[2322.34 → 2323.82] All mixed together
[2323.82 → 2324.44] The decisions
[2324.44 → 2325.62] I choose to make
[2325.62 → 2326.72] And the places
[2326.72 → 2327.60] In my life
[2327.60 → 2328.18] Which it seems
[2328.18 → 2329.60] Decisions are chosen
[2329.60 → 2330.30] For me
[2330.30 → 2332.04] All of it together
[2332.04 → 2333.44] Are led
[2333.44 → 2334.40] And ordained
[2334.40 → 2335.42] By a God
[2335.42 → 2336.20] Who can
[2336.20 → 2337.14] Be trusted
[2337.14 → 2339.88] I deeply struggle
[2339.88 → 2340.88] With this question
[2340.88 → 2342.84] And yet at the same time
[2342.84 → 2344.56] Over and over again
[2344.56 → 2345.74] God patiently
[2345.74 → 2347.18] And faithfully
[2347.18 → 2349.26] Answers this question
[2349.26 → 2351.48] With yes
[2351.48 → 2354.02] Sometimes it means
[2354.02 → 2354.72] Having choices
[2354.72 → 2355.64] And having agency
[2355.64 → 2357.00] And sometimes it means
[2357.00 → 2357.88] It doesn't
[2357.88 → 2359.06] But let's be honest
[2359.06 → 2359.90] This reality
[2359.90 → 2361.52] Is true for
[2361.52 → 2362.50] Those who follow
[2362.50 → 2362.92] Jesus
[2362.92 → 2364.32] And those who do not
[2364.32 → 2365.90] No one is exempt
[2365.90 → 2366.68] From the reality
[2366.68 → 2368.02] That life is a mix
[2368.02 → 2369.62] Of things that we do
[2369.62 → 2372.14] And things done to us
[2372.14 → 2373.52] And different seasons
[2373.52 → 2374.18] Of life
[2374.18 → 2375.42] Those two realities
[2375.42 → 2376.78] Mix in different ways
[2376.78 → 2378.08] And particularities
[2378.08 → 2379.00] For each human
[2379.00 → 2381.26] But the difference
[2381.26 → 2382.12] In bringing this
[2382.12 → 2383.14] Human reality
[2383.14 → 2384.50] Of the mix
[2384.50 → 2385.88] Of things done to us
[2385.88 → 2386.90] And things we do
[2386.90 → 2389.68] Into the story of God
[2389.68 → 2391.96] Is we can find
[2391.96 → 2393.80] Incredible comfort
[2393.80 → 2395.82] In a God
[2395.82 → 2397.00] Who can be trusted
[2397.00 → 2398.70] And mainly
[2398.70 → 2399.52] We see that
[2399.52 → 2401.08] Particularly in
[2401.08 → 2402.24] Psalm 16
[2402.24 → 2404.12] In this image
[2404.12 → 2405.74] In verse 5
[2405.74 → 2406.88] Of a cup
[2406.88 → 2408.26] Let's hone in on
[2408.26 → 2408.66] Cup
[2408.66 → 2409.66] For a moment
[2409.66 → 2411.62] In the time
[2411.62 → 2412.00] And place
[2412.00 → 2412.76] That this was written
[2412.76 → 2413.94] The imagery of
[2413.94 → 2414.36] Cup
[2414.36 → 2415.24] Was a metaphor
[2415.24 → 2417.34] For prosperity
[2417.34 → 2418.50] Or wealth
[2418.50 → 2419.50] For example
[2419.50 → 2420.66] Psalm 23
[2420.66 → 2421.40] David says
[2421.40 → 2423.14] My cup overflows
[2423.14 → 2423.92] That means
[2423.92 → 2425.64] I am so blessed
[2425.64 → 2427.14] I am so
[2427.14 → 2428.48] Have so many gifts
[2428.48 → 2430.46] And also then
[2430.46 → 2431.72] A cup has another layer
[2431.72 → 2432.56] In that time
[2432.56 → 2433.64] Of representing
[2433.64 → 2434.56] Fellowship
[2434.56 → 2435.56] And friendship
[2435.56 → 2437.64] Of not being alone
[2437.64 → 2438.98] And here is where
[2438.98 → 2439.96] Especially our culture
[2439.96 → 2440.70] Breaks down
[2440.70 → 2441.42] From the culture
[2441.42 → 2442.42] Where this was written
[2442.42 → 2444.08] Because at the time
[2444.08 → 2445.08] These words were written
[2445.08 → 2446.44] You wouldn't necessarily
[2446.44 → 2447.64] Use a cup
[2447.64 → 2449.66] Every time you drank something
[2449.66 → 2451.62] It was totally acceptable
[2451.62 → 2453.26] To go right from the spout
[2453.26 → 2454.44] Or to use your hand
[2454.44 → 2455.66] Especially if you're alone
[2455.66 → 2456.60] Or on the run
[2456.60 → 2458.78] And needing to move on
[2458.78 → 2459.66] With your work
[2459.66 → 2460.16] Etc
[2460.16 → 2461.72] But
[2461.72 → 2464.22] Whenever you are feasting
[2464.22 → 2465.04] With other people
[2465.04 → 2465.92] At a table
[2465.92 → 2467.62] Eating a simple meal
[2467.62 → 2468.44] Or a complex meal
[2468.44 → 2469.14] Whatever it might be
[2469.14 → 2470.60] But you're with others
[2470.60 → 2472.94] Everyone always then
[2472.94 → 2473.92] Used a cup
[2473.92 → 2476.36] And so then
[2476.36 → 2477.32] God's then being
[2477.32 → 2478.54] A person's cup
[2478.54 → 2479.98] If an idea of friendship
[2479.98 → 2480.86] And fellowship
[2480.86 → 2481.72] And blessing
[2481.72 → 2483.30] Still though
[2483.30 → 2484.00] We also have
[2484.00 → 2484.86] Another element
[2484.86 → 2485.84] Of this metaphor
[2485.84 → 2487.40] Where scripture talks
[2487.40 → 2488.22] About God giving
[2488.22 → 2489.60] The cup of wrath
[2489.60 → 2491.18] So then
[2491.18 → 2492.02] Is God's cup
[2492.02 → 2493.64] A welcoming thing
[2493.64 → 2495.18] Or is it a harsh thing
[2495.18 → 2497.18] And for this answer
[2497.18 → 2498.62] We need to then look
[2498.62 → 2499.94] To Christ
[2499.94 → 2502.50] A concrete reality
[2502.50 → 2503.46] David didn't know
[2503.46 → 2505.16] He was giving imagery for
[2505.16 → 2506.18] In his words
[2506.18 → 2507.98] For Jesus came
[2507.98 → 2509.06] Thousands of years
[2509.06 → 2509.90] After David
[2509.90 → 2511.62] But with Jesus
[2511.62 → 2513.26] We can say
[2513.26 → 2514.62] Can God be trusted
[2514.62 → 2515.42] This cup
[2515.42 → 2516.58] That God offers
[2516.58 → 2518.30] Can it be trusted
[2518.30 → 2520.26] We have a powerful
[2520.26 → 2521.96] Answer to that question
[2521.96 → 2523.10] With a scene
[2523.10 → 2524.62] Of a physical cup
[2524.62 → 2526.32] With Christ
[2526.32 → 2528.60] Christ holding a cup
[2528.60 → 2529.50] At a table
[2529.50 → 2531.54] During a supper
[2531.54 → 2534.30] The last supper
[2534.30 → 2536.44] In holding a cup
[2536.44 → 2537.06] Of wine
[2537.06 → 2538.42] Jesus looks
[2538.42 → 2539.38] Across the table
[2539.38 → 2540.36] At his disciples
[2540.36 → 2541.78] Many of whom
[2541.78 → 2542.82] Would disappoint him
[2542.82 → 2544.82] In just a few hours
[2544.82 → 2546.84] And he says to them
[2546.84 → 2547.54] Not because of
[2547.54 → 2548.56] Their faithfulness
[2548.56 → 2550.08] But because of his
[2550.08 → 2550.96] He says
[2550.96 → 2551.76] This cup
[2551.76 → 2553.42] Is the new covenant
[2553.42 → 2554.84] In my blood
[2554.84 → 2556.26] Which is poured
[2556.26 → 2557.30] Out
[2557.30 → 2558.42] For you
[2558.42 → 2560.80] And then Christ
[2560.80 → 2561.48] Lived out
[2561.48 → 2562.96] The pouring of the cup
[2562.96 → 2564.70] In the new history
[2564.70 → 2566.28] Changing promise
[2566.28 → 2568.32] Covenant of the cross
[2568.32 → 2570.12] Let us remember
[2570.12 → 2570.92] This is a story
[2570.92 → 2572.38] We belong to
[2572.38 → 2574.28] The reason for that
[2574.28 → 2574.58] We
[2574.58 → 2576.24] Has not always been the case
[2576.24 → 2578.20] But with the cross
[2578.20 → 2579.58] This cup
[2579.58 → 2580.76] Is poured out
[2580.76 → 2581.64] For you
[2581.64 → 2583.54] All the
[2583.54 → 2584.94] Becomes part
[2584.94 → 2586.10] Of the
[2586.10 → 2588.96] So now you and I
[2588.96 → 2590.74] Can look at our real lives
[2590.74 → 2593.18] Full of unexpectedness
[2593.18 → 2594.74] Full of both beauty
[2594.74 → 2595.84] And brokenness
[2595.84 → 2596.80] Full of both choice
[2596.80 → 2598.00] And lack of choice
[2598.00 → 2599.04] And know that
[2599.04 → 2600.50] Because of Christ
[2600.50 → 2602.64] The cup God offers
[2602.64 → 2604.76] That's particular to you
[2604.76 → 2606.84] That's particular to me
[2606.84 → 2608.80] Includes
[2608.80 → 2610.60] Ongoing presence
[2610.60 → 2612.98] Ongoing healing
[2612.98 → 2616.00] Ongoing faithful action
[2616.00 → 2618.60] Even when we are our
[2618.60 → 2619.84] Of options
[2619.84 → 2622.04] The cup itself
[2622.04 → 2624.36] Means God's very presence
[2624.36 → 2625.86] A presence of God
[2625.86 → 2627.00] Who can be trusted
[2627.00 → 2628.38] And offers
[2628.38 → 2629.78] A delightful
[2629.78 → 2631.02] Portion
[2631.02 → 2633.94] Then secondly
[2633.94 → 2635.06] There's an element
[2635.06 → 2635.76] To the delight
[2635.76 → 2636.68] David speaks of
[2636.68 → 2637.58] In Psalm 16
[2637.58 → 2638.08] That involves
[2638.08 → 2638.98] Stepping back
[2638.98 → 2639.92] And looking at
[2639.92 → 2640.86] The various ways
[2640.86 → 2641.90] David's phrases
[2641.90 → 2643.22] God's safety
[2643.22 → 2643.94] And refuge
[2643.94 → 2645.28] And seeing that
[2645.28 → 2646.24] All the phrasing
[2646.24 → 2647.00] David used
[2647.00 → 2647.96] Points
[2647.96 → 2649.32] To a delightful
[2649.32 → 2650.80] Passiveness
[2650.80 → 2653.18] Now you may have
[2653.18 → 2653.76] Already picked up
[2653.76 → 2654.26] On this
[2654.26 → 2655.08] But the word
[2655.08 → 2655.76] Delightful
[2655.76 → 2656.86] And passiveness
[2656.86 → 2658.12] They rarely
[2658.12 → 2658.86] Go together
[2658.86 → 2659.96] In my books
[2659.96 → 2661.54] Passiveness
[2661.54 → 2662.84] Generally drives
[2662.84 → 2663.74] Me crazy
[2663.74 → 2665.18] Observing what
[2665.18 → 2665.88] I perceive
[2665.88 → 2667.00] As passiveness
[2667.00 → 2668.38] Being forced
[2668.38 → 2669.26] To be passive
[2669.26 → 2671.06] Watching others
[2671.06 → 2672.20] Being forced
[2672.20 → 2673.00] To be passive
[2673.00 → 2673.84] Other people
[2673.84 → 2676.52] Choosing passiveness
[2676.52 → 2678.06] Oh the horror
[2678.06 → 2679.92] I love action
[2679.92 → 2681.32] I like clear steps
[2681.32 → 2681.98] I like knowing
[2681.98 → 2682.70] What to do
[2682.70 → 2683.86] And then doing it
[2683.86 → 2685.38] But again
[2685.38 → 2686.72] As I've lived life
[2686.72 → 2687.42] And I continue
[2687.42 → 2688.16] To live life
[2688.16 → 2688.84] I've realized
[2688.84 → 2689.40] That indeed
[2689.40 → 2690.32] Boundary lines
[2690.32 → 2690.96] Do fall
[2690.96 → 2692.44] That things happen
[2692.44 → 2693.20] That I can't
[2693.20 → 2694.88] Always predict
[2694.88 → 2696.10] And control
[2696.10 → 2697.26] And there is
[2697.26 → 2697.74] A time
[2697.74 → 2698.54] For action
[2698.54 → 2700.00] Time for initiative
[2700.00 → 2700.96] But there's
[2700.96 → 2701.78] Also time
[2701.78 → 2702.74] When that action
[2702.74 → 2704.62] Is exhausting
[2704.62 → 2706.62] And passiveness
[2706.62 → 2708.14] Is the invitation
[2708.14 → 2710.04] And I see
[2710.04 → 2710.76] This principle
[2710.76 → 2712.12] Of passiveness
[2712.12 → 2713.18] Play out
[2713.18 → 2714.24] In Psalm 16
[2714.24 → 2715.74] In the very
[2715.74 → 2716.56] Little action
[2716.56 → 2717.64] On the part
[2717.64 → 2718.44] Of David
[2718.44 → 2720.26] King David
[2720.26 → 2721.56] The greatest
[2721.56 → 2721.92] Ruler
[2721.92 → 2722.66] Of all
[2722.66 → 2723.28] Of ancient
[2723.28 → 2723.92] Israel
[2723.92 → 2725.76] And we see
[2725.76 → 2726.54] Action
[2726.54 → 2728.36] From David's
[2728.36 → 2729.28] God
[2729.28 → 2731.16] This struck me
[2731.16 → 2732.22] Most in verse 7
[2732.22 → 2733.18] David says
[2733.18 → 2733.88] I will praise
[2733.88 → 2734.24] The Lord
[2734.24 → 2735.08] Who counsels
[2735.08 → 2735.26] Me
[2735.26 → 2736.72] Even at night
[2736.72 → 2737.82] My heart
[2737.82 → 2739.14] Instructs me
[2739.14 → 2740.46] At night
[2740.46 → 2741.74] So this could
[2741.74 → 2742.26] Mean that while
[2742.26 → 2743.32] David sleeps
[2743.32 → 2745.06] God counsels
[2745.06 → 2745.82] And directs
[2745.82 → 2746.08] Him
[2746.08 → 2747.24] Now there's a
[2747.24 → 2748.02] Concept to think
[2748.02 → 2748.62] More about
[2748.62 → 2750.26] Or maybe
[2750.26 → 2750.88] That David
[2750.88 → 2751.90] Can't sleep
[2751.90 → 2753.10] And so in the
[2753.10 → 2753.96] Middle of the
[2753.96 → 2754.24] Night
[2754.24 → 2755.46] The very time
[2755.46 → 2756.20] When David
[2756.20 → 2756.98] Can literally
[2756.98 → 2757.92] Do nothing
[2757.92 → 2758.98] About his
[2758.98 → 2759.88] Problems
[2759.88 → 2761.04] Maybe a situation
[2761.04 → 2761.78] You can relate
[2761.78 → 2762.10] To
[2762.10 → 2763.90] Laying there
[2763.90 → 2764.50] In bed
[2764.50 → 2765.22] Or pacing
[2765.22 → 2766.40] Or being up
[2766.40 → 2767.72] Because sleep
[2767.72 → 2768.44] Won't come
[2768.44 → 2769.44] God
[2769.44 → 2770.66] Is there
[2770.66 → 2771.72] And God
[2771.72 → 2772.18] Is not just
[2772.18 → 2772.78] Hanging out
[2772.78 → 2774.02] Offering melatonin
[2774.02 → 2775.08] No God
[2775.08 → 2775.54] Is giving
[2775.54 → 2776.24] Wisdom
[2776.24 → 2777.14] And direction
[2777.14 → 2778.42] To David
[2778.42 → 2779.72] In the middle
[2779.72 → 2780.64] Of the night
[2780.64 → 2781.92] In the midst
[2781.92 → 2782.38] When he
[2782.38 → 2782.76] Can do
[2782.76 → 2783.22] Nothing
[2783.22 → 2785.02] And the
[2785.02 → 2785.46] Passiveness
[2785.46 → 2786.02] Doesn't end
[2786.02 → 2786.32] There
[2786.32 → 2787.40] In verse
[2787.40 → 2787.64] Eight
[2787.64 → 2788.02] It says
[2788.02 → 2788.64] I keep
[2788.64 → 2789.22] My eyes
[2789.22 → 2789.80] Always
[2789.80 → 2790.38] On the
[2790.38 → 2790.88] Lord
[2790.88 → 2792.00] With him
[2792.00 → 2792.40] At my
[2792.40 → 2793.20] Right hand
[2793.20 → 2794.08] I will
[2794.08 → 2795.06] Not be
[2795.06 → 2795.56] Shaken
[2795.56 → 2797.12] The phrase
[2797.12 → 2797.60] With God
[2797.60 → 2798.00] At my
[2798.00 → 2799.24] Right hand
[2799.24 → 2800.20] Has this
[2800.20 → 2800.40] Sense
[2800.40 → 2800.82] That God
[2800.82 → 2801.30] Is just
[2801.30 → 2801.54] There
[2801.54 → 2801.98] It's not
[2801.98 → 2802.96] With God
[2802.96 → 2803.62] With grabbing
[2803.62 → 2804.54] On to God
[2804.54 → 2806.36] Or reaching
[2806.36 → 2807.24] Out or even
[2807.24 → 2807.62] Running
[2807.62 → 2808.44] After God
[2808.44 → 2809.70] At my
[2809.70 → 2810.66] Right hand
[2810.66 → 2811.90] David
[2811.90 → 2812.24] Literally
[2812.24 → 2812.86] Then has
[2812.86 → 2813.78] To actively
[2813.78 → 2814.70] Work to
[2814.70 → 2815.52] Not keep
[2815.52 → 2816.06] His eyes
[2816.06 → 2816.40] On the
[2816.40 → 2816.68] Lord
[2816.68 → 2817.40] And he
[2817.40 → 2817.66] Even
[2817.66 → 2818.76] Look
[2818.76 → 2819.74] Towards the
[2819.74 → 2820.00] Right
[2820.00 → 2820.58] And who
[2820.58 → 2821.20] Would God
[2821.20 → 2821.64] David
[2821.64 → 2822.16] See
[2822.16 → 2823.98] But God
[2823.98 → 2826.48] And then
[2826.48 → 2826.96] Verse nine
[2826.96 → 2827.34] In this
[2827.34 → 2827.92] Presence
[2827.92 → 2828.44] From God
[2828.44 → 2829.12] And direction
[2829.12 → 2829.76] From God
[2829.76 → 2830.68] In the midst
[2830.68 → 2831.24] Of different
[2831.24 → 2831.70] Points
[2831.70 → 2832.36] In the day
[2832.36 → 2833.04] In the midst
[2833.04 → 2833.86] Of being
[2833.86 → 2834.20] There
[2834.20 → 2834.60] David
[2834.60 → 2834.96] Says
[2834.96 → 2835.74] My body
[2835.74 → 2836.82] Will rest
[2836.82 → 2837.76] Secure
[2837.76 → 2840.06] These series
[2840.06 → 2840.82] Of passive
[2840.82 → 2841.30] Images
[2841.30 → 2842.56] Are a
[2842.56 → 2842.94] Consistent
[2842.94 → 2843.62] Reminder to
[2843.62 → 2843.88] Me of
[2843.88 → 2844.80] How God's
[2844.80 → 2845.64] Delightful
[2845.64 → 2846.42] Provision
[2846.42 → 2847.26] Works
[2847.26 → 2848.24] So often
[2848.24 → 2848.70] I believe
[2848.70 → 2849.12] The lie
[2849.12 → 2849.82] That delightful
[2849.82 → 2850.42] Things from
[2850.42 → 2850.78] God
[2850.78 → 2851.78] Has for me
[2851.78 → 2852.16] Are like
[2852.16 → 2852.74] A treasure
[2852.74 → 2853.30] Hunt
[2853.30 → 2854.46] And to get
[2854.46 → 2854.94] Them I need
[2854.94 → 2855.40] To read
[2855.40 → 2855.92] The treasure
[2855.92 → 2856.46] Map
[2856.46 → 2857.00] The word
[2857.00 → 2857.34] Of God
[2857.34 → 2858.04] Correctly
[2858.04 → 2859.04] And decode
[2859.04 → 2859.58] It properly
[2859.58 → 2860.14] Now there's
[2860.14 → 2860.56] A feat
[2860.56 → 2861.20] In itself
[2861.20 → 2862.42] And then I
[2862.42 → 2862.70] Need to
[2862.70 → 2863.62] Apply those
[2863.62 → 2864.42] Things to
[2864.42 → 2865.36] My specific
[2865.36 → 2866.06] Life
[2866.06 → 2866.82] That's
[2866.82 → 2867.08] Always
[2867.08 → 2867.62] Changing
[2867.62 → 2868.84] And if
[2868.84 → 2869.30] I can
[2869.30 → 2870.24] Decode
[2870.24 → 2871.16] And apply
[2871.16 → 2872.16] Properly
[2872.16 → 2873.28] Then I
[2873.28 → 2873.78] Receive
[2873.78 → 2874.62] God's
[2874.62 → 2875.16] Blessing
[2875.16 → 2875.66] And meanwhile
[2875.66 → 2876.08] In this
[2876.08 → 2876.84] Whole time
[2876.84 → 2877.54] God is
[2877.54 → 2877.96] Up in
[2877.96 → 2878.42] Heaven
[2878.42 → 2879.60] Watching
[2879.60 → 2880.42] From afar
[2880.42 → 2881.30] Nodding
[2881.30 → 2881.88] In approval
[2881.88 → 2882.52] At times
[2882.52 → 2883.04] Shaking
[2883.04 → 2883.46] God's
[2883.46 → 2883.70] Head
[2883.70 → 2884.18] At times
[2884.18 → 2884.48] I'm not
[2884.48 → 2884.90] Always sure
[2884.90 → 2885.44] When's
[2885.44 → 2885.88] The nodding
[2885.88 → 2886.32] And when's
[2886.32 → 2886.68] The shaking
[2886.68 → 2887.16] Fully
[2887.16 → 2888.26] And at
[2888.26 → 2888.48] Times
[2888.48 → 2888.90] Definitely
[2888.90 → 2889.16] They're
[2889.16 → 2889.90] Sighing
[2889.90 → 2890.60] At just
[2890.60 → 2891.28] The mess
[2891.28 → 2891.68] I am
[2891.68 → 2892.14] Making
[2892.14 → 2894.08] But according
[2894.08 → 2894.66] To psalm
[2894.66 → 2895.22] 16
[2895.22 → 2896.30] This isn't
[2896.30 → 2896.88] The imagery
[2896.88 → 2897.52] We see
[2897.52 → 2898.74] And really
[2898.74 → 2899.18] All of
[2899.18 → 2899.58] Scripture
[2899.58 → 2900.06] We see
[2900.06 → 2900.46] God's
[2900.46 → 2901.02] Abundant
[2901.02 → 2902.22] Presence
[2902.22 → 2903.72] And direction
[2903.72 → 2905.46] That often
[2905.46 → 2906.28] Has nothing
[2906.28 → 2907.46] Or at times
[2907.46 → 2908.34] Very little
[2908.34 → 2909.24] To do
[2909.24 → 2910.22] With
[2910.22 → 2911.44] Us
[2911.44 → 2913.32] And even
[2913.32 → 2913.60] Though I
[2913.60 → 2913.98] Struggled
[2913.98 → 2914.56] To swallow
[2914.56 → 2915.40] This reality
[2915.40 → 2916.28] And to be
[2916.28 → 2916.54] Honest
[2916.54 → 2917.06] The struggle
[2917.06 → 2917.76] Is currently
[2917.76 → 2918.28] Real
[2918.28 → 2919.68] The small
[2919.68 → 2920.18] Bits of
[2920.18 → 2920.88] Passiveness
[2920.88 → 2921.98] God invites
[2921.98 → 2922.34] Me to
[2922.34 → 2923.02] Enter into
[2923.02 → 2923.52] And that
[2923.52 → 2924.66] I submit
[2924.66 → 2925.06] To
[2925.06 → 2926.38] I am
[2926.38 → 2926.72] Finding
[2926.72 → 2927.42] Are so
[2927.42 → 2928.22] Delightful
[2928.22 → 2929.68] And holistic
[2929.68 → 2930.28] In my
[2930.28 → 2930.78] Body
[2930.78 → 2931.32] Soul
[2931.32 → 2932.18] And mind
[2932.18 → 2933.24] That slowly
[2933.24 → 2934.14] We're talking
[2934.14 → 2935.08] Very slowly
[2935.08 → 2936.24] I'm starting
[2936.24 → 2937.08] To understand
[2937.08 → 2938.12] What David
[2938.12 → 2938.84] Is getting
[2938.84 → 2939.30] At
[2939.30 → 2940.86] And even
[2940.86 → 2941.48] More so
[2941.48 → 2942.36] David points
[2942.36 → 2942.74] Me to
[2942.74 → 2943.30] Christ
[2943.30 → 2944.16] And I
[2944.16 → 2944.60] Hear the
[2944.60 → 2945.04] Words of
[2945.04 → 2945.52] Christ
[2945.52 → 2946.38] Coming out
[2946.38 → 2946.76] This is
[2946.76 → 2947.40] The message
[2947.40 → 2948.32] Version that
[2948.32 → 2948.78] Says
[2948.78 → 2949.86] What I'm
[2949.86 → 2950.32] Trying to
[2950.32 → 2950.86] Do here
[2950.86 → 2951.26] Is to
[2951.26 → 2951.78] Get you
[2951.78 → 2952.80] To relax
[2952.80 → 2953.92] To not
[2953.92 → 2954.56] Be so
[2954.56 → 2955.44] Preoccupied
[2955.44 → 2956.06] With getting
[2956.06 → 2957.12] So you
[2957.12 → 2957.94] Can respond
[2957.94 → 2958.68] To God's
[2958.68 → 2959.20] Giving
[2959.20 → 2960.82] Steep your
[2960.82 → 2961.30] Life
[2961.30 → 2962.02] In God
[2962.02 → 2962.64] Reality
[2962.64 → 2963.86] God
[2963.86 → 2964.38] Initiative
[2964.38 → 2965.64] God
[2965.64 → 2966.28] Provision
[2966.28 → 2967.74] Don't worry
[2967.74 → 2968.36] About missing
[2968.36 → 2968.80] Out
[2968.80 → 2969.84] You'll find
[2969.84 → 2970.54] All your
[2970.54 → 2971.00] Every day
[2971.00 → 2971.60] Human
[2971.60 → 2972.74] Concerns
[2972.74 → 2973.38] Will
[2973.38 → 2973.92] Be
[2973.92 → 2974.42] Met
[2974.42 → 2976.18] Now there
[2976.18 → 2976.40] Is a
[2976.40 → 2976.82] Delightful
[2976.82 → 2977.48] Passiveness
[2977.48 → 2978.86] I can
[2978.86 → 2979.26] Get
[2979.26 → 2979.86] Behind
[2979.86 → 2982.24] Than
[2982.24 → 2983.02] Finally I
[2983.02 → 2983.42] Mentioned
[2983.42 → 2983.94] Earlier the
[2983.94 → 2984.56] Word delight
[2984.56 → 2985.12] It's used
[2985.12 → 2985.78] Twice in
[2985.78 → 2986.48] This psalm
[2986.48 → 2987.26] We already
[2987.26 → 2987.86] Touched on
[2987.86 → 2988.26] One of
[2988.26 → 2988.52] Them
[2988.52 → 2989.38] The boundary
[2989.38 → 2989.94] Lines have
[2989.94 → 2990.44] Fallen for
[2990.44 → 2990.74] Me in
[2990.74 → 2991.14] Pleasant
[2991.14 → 2991.66] Places
[2991.66 → 2992.30] Surely I
[2992.30 → 2992.58] Have a
[2992.58 → 2993.34] Delightful
[2993.34 → 2994.56] Inheritance
[2994.56 → 2995.46] And the
[2995.46 → 2995.90] Second time
[2995.90 → 2996.22] Can be
[2996.22 → 2996.82] Found back
[2996.82 → 2997.18] Up in
[2997.18 → 2997.42] Verse
[2997.42 → 2997.90] Three
[2997.90 → 2999.22] In regards
[2999.22 → 2999.46] To
[2999.46 → 3000.20] Delightful
[3000.20 → 3001.04] People
[3001.04 → 3002.50] It says
[3002.50 → 3003.06] I
[3003.06 → 3003.52] Save the
[3003.52 → 3003.80] Holy
[3003.80 → 3004.26] People
[3004.26 → 3004.64] Who are
[3004.64 → 3004.78] In
[3004.78 → 3004.92] The
[3004.92 → 3005.38] Land
[3005.38 → 3006.04] They
[3006.04 → 3006.46] Are
[3006.46 → 3006.66] The
[3006.66 → 3007.02] Noble
[3007.02 → 3007.56] Ones
[3007.56 → 3007.76] In
[3007.76 → 3008.22] Whom
[3008.22 → 3008.52] Is
[3008.52 → 3009.14] All
[3009.14 → 3009.74] My
[3009.74 → 3010.36] Delight
[3010.36 → 3012.08] When
[3012.08 → 3012.40] Looking at
[3012.40 → 3012.54] The
[3012.54 → 3013.12] Context
[3013.12 → 3013.40] Of
[3013.40 → 3013.62] This
[3013.62 → 3014.16] Phrase
[3014.16 → 3014.64] It
[3014.64 → 3014.88] Looks
[3014.88 → 3015.06] Like
[3015.06 → 3015.22] The
[3015.22 → 3015.66] Eye
[3015.66 → 3015.90] Is
[3015.90 → 3016.28] Referring
[3016.28 → 3016.46] To
[3016.46 → 3016.78] David
[3016.78 → 3017.24] Speaking
[3017.24 → 3018.16] And
[3018.16 → 3018.28] The
[3018.28 → 3018.64] Noble
[3018.64 → 3019.02] Ones
[3019.02 → 3019.20] Are
[3019.20 → 3019.58] Fellow
[3019.58 → 3020.18] Believers
[3020.18 → 3021.56] And
[3021.56 → 3021.70] This
[3021.70 → 3022.04] Element
[3022.04 → 3022.28] Of
[3022.28 → 3022.58] Delight
[3022.58 → 3022.78] Has
[3022.78 → 3022.98] Made
[3022.98 → 3024.30] Made
[3024.30 → 3024.60] To
[3024.60 → 3025.04] But
[3025.04 → 3029.66] Stan
[3029.66 → 3029.88] Ellen
[3029.88 → 3032.44] Post
[3032.44 → 3041.26] There
[3041.52 → 3041.88] investigators
[3041.88 → 3042.10] Yes
[3042.10 → 3042.90] Rather
[3043.84 → 3051.82] And yet verse 3 reveals that part of the delight God has given to David is through others who also follow God.
[3052.84 → 3056.06] And as I reflected on this particular verse, I've asked myself,
[3056.06 → 3062.78] Are the holy people in my land the noble ones in whom is all my delight?
[3064.38 → 3070.36] Like many of you, I've been profoundly hurt by other Christians over my life.
[3070.36 → 3073.18] Just like David was.
[3074.14 → 3078.96] Other Christians currently regularly cause me great frustration.
[3079.72 → 3082.14] Just like they did for David.
[3083.42 → 3088.46] And yet as I stop, and I look at my experience,
[3089.90 → 3095.36] I think I can deeply and authentically say that I get what David is saying.
[3095.36 → 3101.06] And it makes me pause before answering that personally for myself.
[3101.26 → 3103.82] Because I don't want to claim something that's not true.
[3104.72 → 3114.38] And also because this type of delight is what I would claim and have seen in my life to be a sneaky delight.
[3115.12 → 3117.10] Far sneakier than the other ones.
[3118.06 → 3119.20] Let me give you an example.
[3119.20 → 3126.94] So there are many forms of Christians gathering together that could then be the noble ones in whom is all our delight.
[3127.44 → 3134.90] This could be friendship, mentorship, group gatherings, worship services, small groups, Bible studies.
[3135.62 → 3140.86] Even technology allows us to be live-streamed to books and podcasts.
[3141.26 → 3142.76] And the list could go on.
[3142.76 → 3149.18] But I find time and time again, as much as all of those are delightful in so many ways,
[3149.84 → 3159.40] a consistent place for sneaky delight that I have learned to value so much is with others around a table.
[3160.38 → 3165.78] And I found myself at a very, very surprising table these last few years.
[3165.78 → 3173.76] With noble ones from the land I am part of, of tapestry nights, and more surprisingly, is not the people.
[3174.32 → 3182.10] They are delightful, but the delightful table we have found ourselves around and how it has truly been delightful.
[3182.92 → 3187.56] So a rhythm at my church that I'm sure is similar in some ways to Ladder, CRC,
[3187.56 → 3192.60] even the fellowship that we'll have after is an example of that in your context,
[3192.74 → 3197.70] is that in my context we meet on a Saturday night from like 5 to 6.15.
[3198.34 → 3204.96] And so that time then lends itself well that a group of people from the land I belong to, my church,
[3205.42 → 3208.22] they go out for dinner after the service.
[3208.76 → 3213.36] Various numbers and structures, number, we are sometimes structured, sometimes there's not,
[3213.36 → 3217.28] but there's this rhythm continually of going out for a meal.
[3217.56 → 3224.18] And the place that the main core, the main thrust of these people who are particularly committed to this,
[3224.62 → 3232.32] who do this, means that we almost always frequent one of the various mall food courts in Richmond.
[3233.72 → 3234.90] Food courts.
[3235.98 → 3241.68] Sticky tables, wooden chairs, every type of fast food you could possibly think of.
[3241.68 → 3245.20] I think it's the plastic trays that really get it for me.
[3245.20 → 3251.96] On the surface, food courts and delight, at least in my books, do not go together.
[3252.76 → 3255.04] When I think about a table, I think of beautiful.
[3255.88 → 3258.92] I think of rich dishes, of foods.
[3259.56 → 3261.04] I think of comfortable chairs.
[3261.14 → 3262.90] These are not food court things.
[3262.90 → 3269.10] But I have, over the last few years, as I have entered into this rhythm,
[3269.52 → 3274.72] and entered into the particularities of my land and the holy people in my land,
[3274.72 → 3277.92] and I enter this food court with them,
[3278.60 → 3285.50] I have realized I've experienced or observed delight every time.
[3285.50 → 3288.04] I now expect it.
[3288.64 → 3291.20] And though sometimes it is more obvious than others,
[3291.80 → 3295.22] and at times the delight is gone as fast as it comes,
[3296.04 → 3298.48] delight has never shown up.
[3301.00 → 3302.38] Gathering has a price.
[3303.78 → 3306.16] Going to food courts for me has a price.
[3306.90 → 3310.16] All the gathering, fellowship, small groups, coming to worship,
[3310.16 → 3313.50] all these things, moving into friendship with others,
[3313.86 → 3314.98] they have a price.
[3315.96 → 3317.18] They can be awkward.
[3318.70 → 3320.14] Small groups can be awkward.
[3320.34 → 3321.78] Services can be awkward.
[3321.96 → 3324.28] One-on-one gatherings can be awkward.
[3324.44 → 3327.30] I regularly find them awkward.
[3328.30 → 3331.02] It takes energy, even for an extrovert.
[3331.88 → 3334.34] It consistently disappoints.
[3335.12 → 3339.58] But I have learned I wouldn't give it up for anything.
[3340.84 → 3344.26] For the holy people I get to be in the land with in this current season,
[3344.62 → 3347.50] and I could bear witness to this in other seasons
[3347.50 → 3350.30] and other holy people in other land as well.
[3351.46 → 3354.26] But currently, what is true and what has been true
[3354.26 → 3356.92] is if I am willing to show up,
[3357.42 → 3359.98] and sometimes showing up is all I have to give,
[3360.32 → 3362.92] and sometimes more than showing up is what I have to give,
[3363.66 → 3367.56] that they keep offering me new and amazingly rich
[3367.56 → 3371.42] and often sneaky gifts of delight.
[3373.94 → 3375.04] So as we close,
[3375.70 → 3378.72] one of the metaphors that Pastor Eugene Peterson uses
[3378.72 → 3382.46] to explain the way of Jesus that the Bible offers
[3382.46 → 3386.86] is he calls it the large country of salvation.
[3386.86 → 3392.10] Friends, I so easily can have an anemic view of salvation.
[3392.82 → 3394.44] It's about going to heaven when I die,
[3394.54 → 3396.28] about doing the right thing or wrong thing
[3396.28 → 3398.08] and making sure to know which is which
[3398.08 → 3399.56] and doing enough right.
[3400.42 → 3403.70] But the land we've just explored in these past few minutes
[3403.70 → 3405.96] are a totally different picture.
[3406.80 → 3411.68] They point to this large country of salvation.
[3411.68 → 3415.12] It's a salvation that I've experienced
[3415.12 → 3418.06] as being very tied to my real life,
[3418.44 → 3421.72] my real longings, my real dreams.
[3422.74 → 3426.04] It's a vision of a land that I am both invited to step into
[3426.04 → 3427.98] and one, to my surprise,
[3428.10 → 3432.64] I simply find myself in on no merit of my own.
[3432.64 → 3435.92] It's a land of a delightful portion,
[3436.90 → 3438.26] a delightful passiveness,
[3439.12 → 3440.50] and a delightful people.
[3441.64 → 3444.68] It's a land that invites my participation, certainly,
[3445.36 → 3450.12] and is at work when it feels like life is happening to me.
[3451.14 → 3453.70] It's a land whose entrance fee is bought
[3453.70 → 3457.38] for you and for me by the blood of Christ.
[3459.06 → 3460.54] And though I've given my own reflections
[3460.54 → 3462.06] on this land this morning,
[3462.06 → 3464.78] my prayer is you also see yourself
[3464.78 → 3468.70] in your real life in this land.
[3469.68 → 3471.36] If you're new to the way of Jesus,
[3471.56 → 3473.36] this land is open to you today.
[3474.30 → 3475.10] Come on in.
[3475.84 → 3477.76] Tentative steps are welcome.
[3478.88 → 3481.32] And maybe if you look up and around,
[3481.46 → 3483.12] you'll realize you've been here a while
[3483.12 → 3484.64] and didn't even know it.
[3485.74 → 3488.28] If this land is not new at all to you,
[3488.88 → 3491.54] I pray that you continue to be surprised.
[3492.06 → 3494.14] To be delighted.
[3494.14 → 3496.86] both with Psalm 16
[3496.86 → 3500.36] and the array of salvation geography
[3500.36 → 3503.24] that is held in the whole of the Psalms
[3503.24 → 3505.90] and of scriptures and the things of God
[3505.90 → 3507.34] in your own life.
[3508.30 → 3510.70] To join the Psalms in bringing God
[3510.70 → 3511.66] your frustration,
[3512.54 → 3513.18] your lament,
[3513.34 → 3514.58] your petition for help,
[3514.66 → 3516.72] your praise of God's goodness.
[3516.72 → 3519.68] not apart from your real life,
[3519.68 → 3522.58] but in and through your real life.
[3523.66 → 3524.40] And slowly,
[3524.56 → 3526.28] may we taste and see
[3526.28 → 3528.30] the presence and faithfulness
[3528.30 → 3530.90] of God that allow David to say,
[3531.44 → 3531.92] Lord,
[3532.06 → 3533.84] you alone are my portion
[3533.84 → 3535.00] and my cup.
[3535.44 → 3537.24] You make my lot secure.
[3538.10 → 3540.46] The boundary lines have fallen for me
[3540.46 → 3542.54] in pleasant places.
[3542.54 → 3543.54] Surely,
[3543.54 → 3543.94] surely,
[3543.94 → 3546.58] I have a delightful inheritance.
[3547.46 → 3548.50] Let's pray.
[3553.64 → 3554.78] Delightful God,
[3555.66 → 3559.74] we praise you today.
[3560.70 → 3561.76] We praise you
[3561.76 → 3564.84] that our entrance fee
[3564.84 → 3567.20] into your presence,
[3567.54 → 3568.94] into life with you
[3568.94 → 3571.30] is not based on our own,
[3571.88 → 3572.84] but is based
[3572.84 → 3575.48] on the blood and cross
[3575.48 → 3576.36] of Christ.
[3577.96 → 3579.18] We thank you then
[3579.18 → 3579.96] for that gift.
[3581.10 → 3581.76] And the gift
[3581.76 → 3583.42] is not just making it through,
[3584.86 → 3585.58] slugging it out
[3585.58 → 3586.74] that the future will come,
[3586.80 → 3587.36] there'll be delight
[3587.36 → 3588.38] on the other side,
[3588.54 → 3589.58] but it is the here
[3589.58 → 3590.36] and the now.
[3591.58 → 3591.84] And yet,
[3591.90 → 3592.58] that is so hard
[3592.58 → 3593.58] to see sometimes.
[3595.94 → 3597.80] The land of salvation
[3597.80 → 3599.68] that you paint for us
[3599.68 → 3600.60] looks so different
[3600.60 → 3602.56] than our world
[3602.56 → 3603.52] and our jobs
[3603.52 → 3604.32] and our neighbourhoods
[3604.32 → 3606.06] and in our culture.
[3607.08 → 3607.70] May God,
[3607.80 → 3608.90] you give us eyes
[3608.90 → 3610.64] to see the particularities
[3610.64 → 3611.36] of delight
[3611.36 → 3613.28] that you are offering
[3613.28 → 3615.26] and continue to offer to us
[3615.26 → 3616.74] in the particularities
[3616.74 → 3618.48] of our existence,
[3619.54 → 3620.30] in our wiring,
[3621.12 → 3622.18] in our experiences.
[3623.18 → 3623.94] I thank you,
[3624.00 → 3624.68] you are present.
[3624.68 → 3625.88] May you continue
[3625.88 → 3627.16] to be present
[3627.16 → 3628.04] to each of us.
[3628.86 → 3629.12] Amen.
[3640.12 → 3640.90] Please rise
[3640.90 → 3642.14] for our song of response.
[3642.14 → 3655.92] Give thanks to the Lord,
[3655.92 → 3657.60] our God and King.
[3657.98 → 3660.82] He is rich in Israel forever.
[3662.28 → 3664.36] For He is with His above,
[3664.36 → 3665.86] all thanks.
[3665.86 → 3668.90] In His wonders forever
[3668.90 → 3672.54] Sing praise
[3672.54 → 3677.04] Sing praise
[3677.04 → 3681.84] With a mighty hand and a stretch star
[3681.84 → 3684.92] In His wonders forever
[3684.92 → 3689.92] For the life that's been reborn
[3689.92 → 3692.98] In His wonders forever
[3692.98 → 3697.74] Sing praise
[3697.74 → 3701.60] Sing praise
[3701.60 → 3705.60] Sing praise
[3705.60 → 3709.52] Sing praise
[3709.52 → 3713.60] For God is with us
[3713.60 → 3717.22] Forever good and strong
[3717.22 → 3721.50] Forever God is with us
[3721.50 → 3722.74] Forever
[3722.74 → 3726.26] Forever
[3726.26 → 3733.54] From the rising to the setting sun
[3733.54 → 3736.74] His love endures forever
[3736.74 → 3741.76] And by the grace of God we will carry on
[3741.76 → 3744.76] His love endures forever
[3744.76 → 3746.52] Sing praise
[3746.52 → 3747.52] Sing praise

[3764.00 → 3764.76] Forever
[3764.76 → 3765.76] Forever
[3765.76 → 3768.48] God is strong
[3768.48 → 3769.76] Forever
[3769.76 → 3772.76] God is with us
[3772.76 → 3773.96] Forever
[3773.96 → 3777.76] Forever
[3777.76 → 3778.52] Forever
[3778.52 → 3782.52] You may be seated
[3782.52 → 3797.32] Our offering this morning that we are privileged to share in is for an organization called One Book
[3797.32 → 3807.08] Who translates scripture for people groups that have never had the gospel in their own heart language
[3807.08 → 3811.68] And this also helps people with literacy and education and so much more
[3811.68 → 3817.22] And so this is what we are giving to this morning
[3817.22 → 3820.92] I hope that you can share generously as you are able
[3820.92 → 3824.08] Father
[3824.52 → 3841.12] Lord
[3841.12 → 3843.54] Fly
[3843.54 → 3845.54] Amen.
[3873.54 → 3875.54] Amen.
[3903.54 → 3905.54] Amen.
[3905.54 → 3907.54] Amen.
[3907.54 → 3909.54] Amen.

[3915.54 → 3917.54] Amen.
[3917.54 → 3919.54] Amen.
[3919.54 → 3939.54] Let's open our hearts and our minds to God in prayer this morning together.
[3943.54 → 3951.54] Alpha and Omega, you have been God before time began and will continue throughout eternity.
[3951.54 → 3956.54] How wonderfully mysterious such a concept is to us and how comforting.
[3956.54 → 3962.54] We come to you precisely because you are the one who keeps us in your hand no matter what.
[3962.54 → 3965.54] You are our source of all joy.
[3965.54 → 3970.54] You are the one who comforts us and gives us hope.
[3970.54 → 3977.54] We run to you for a holy hug that you provide in our quiet times with you, sometimes through
[3977.54 → 3979.54] scripture or prayer or meditation.
[3979.54 → 3987.54] We thank you for giving us access to you through both written word and the word made flesh.
[3987.54 → 3995.54] Creator, we hold up to you this beautiful world you have made, the same one we've made such a mess of.
[3995.54 → 4002.54] Give us wisdom and the willingness to do the hard work of cleaning up the home you've given us.
[4002.54 → 4007.54] Bring rain to thirsty land, especially where there is no water for food to grow.
[4007.54 → 4014.54] We think of East African countries and other places where people struggle daily to find enough food to eat.
[4014.54 → 4021.54] Fill those who are hungry with good things and quench their thirst of body and soul.
[4021.54 → 4031.54] Give wisdom and safety to teams who bring hope to vulnerable populations because of weather patterns, corrupt governments or conflict.
[4031.54 → 4037.54] In your mercy, almighty Father, bring an end to the devastating war in Ukraine.
[4037.54 → 4046.54] Wherever violence causes people to flee their homeland, provide welcoming places and faces for them to find refuge.
[4046.54 → 4052.54] In your compassion and grace, carry those who suffer this kind of trauma.
[4052.54 → 4059.54] We pray for rain to douse the flames that threaten lives both here and around the globe.
[4059.54 → 4067.54] We pray instead for your purifying fire to burn within us with a passion to love you and our neighbour.
[4067.54 → 4071.54] Jesus, Lord of all, you are the great healer.
[4071.54 → 4074.54] Your words and your touch bring us wholeness.
[4074.54 → 4081.54] We praise you for caring for Jordan and for the great measure of healing he's experienced.
[4081.54 → 4086.54] Thank you that Amy is home again and will be able to continue treatments soon.
[4086.54 → 4089.54] Thank you for Annette's successful surgery.
[4089.54 → 4093.54] Will you continue to give her full recovery, we pray.
[4093.54 → 4098.54] We are grateful that Tony has come home and can be more comfortable in his surroundings.
[4098.54 → 4102.54] We pray for his full recovery soon as well.
[4102.54 → 4106.54] We thank you for these answered prayers.
[4106.54 → 4113.54] All those of our fellowship who struggle with dis-ease of body, mind or spirit, we bring to you.
[4113.54 → 4117.54] Holy Spirit, may they find comfort in your presence.
[4117.54 → 4120.54] Give strength and patience to those who care for them.
[4120.54 → 4127.54] Walk with each of us, comfort us in grief, and heal us in your mercy and grace.
[4127.54 → 4134.54] Thank you for medical teams whose expertise is one of the valuable means by which you restore our health.
[4134.54 → 4137.54] Bless the work of their heart and hands.
[4137.54 → 4140.54] We pray for the work of one book.
[4140.54 → 4147.54] Thank you for the privilege of helping people who have never done so to receive the gospel in their own language.
[4147.54 → 4152.54] May your word bring hope and joy wherever it is read and heard.
[4152.54 → 4157.54] May their improved literacy improve each aspect of their lives to your glory.
[4157.54 → 4164.54] We give you thanks for the slower pace we can enjoy over the summer, perhaps on vacation and visits with others.
[4164.54 → 4171.54] We pray for Pastor Jason, Christy and their kids as they enjoy a break this month.
[4171.54 → 4174.54] Keep them safe and refresh them.
[4174.54 → 4178.54] Thank you for the safety we've had on roads so far this summer.
[4178.54 → 4187.54] Keep watch on us as we travel during this summer season and prepare us for the coming year of work, study or whatever you have planned for us.
[4187.54 → 4192.54] We thank you this morning for the message that Pastor Jen brought to us.
[4192.54 → 4198.54] Thank you that we can delight in you and that you delight in us as well.
[4198.54 → 4201.54] Lead us and guide us.
[4201.54 → 4206.54] Teach us to discern your will and to walk in step with your spirit.
[4206.54 → 4212.54] We pray all this in the saving name of Jesus Christ, our only hope and salvation.
[4212.54 → 4213.54] Amen.
[4222.54 → 4228.54] I have the privilege of blessing you.
[4228.54 → 4230.54] Ladder CRC.
[4230.54 → 4235.54] And these stem from the words on your wall there, I'm the way, the truth and the life.
[4235.54 → 4241.54] May you, Ladder CRC, know that Christ is the way.
[4241.54 → 4247.54] May you, Ladder CRC, know that grace this week.
[4247.54 → 4254.54] May you know the truth in the places you are discerning yourself, your family, your friends, your work.
[4254.54 → 4261.54] May you know the truth and may you know that the life is found in Christ in your real life.
[4261.54 → 4264.54] May you see the presence of Christ and God at work.
[4264.54 → 4278.54] May you peace of Christ be with you.
[4278.54 → 4290.76] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, You alone are worthy

[4300.44 → 4310.74] Lamb of God, Holy One, righteous and forgiving
