[896.82 --> 903.04]  Lord, give us strength to live for you.
[903.44 --> 907.94]  And glorify your name.
[908.62 --> 913.90]  Your name is a strong and mighty tower.
[913.90 --> 918.90]  Your name is a shelter like no other.
[918.90 --> 924.90]  Your name, let the nation sing it louder.
[924.90 --> 929.90]  Though nothing has the power to say.
[929.90 --> 932.90]  But your name.
[943.90 --> 946.90]  Jesus, Messiah.
[946.90 --> 947.90]  Messiah.
[947.90 --> 953.90]  Name above all names.
[953.90 --> 957.90]  Blessed Redeemer.
[957.90 --> 958.90]  Emmanuel.
[958.90 --> 960.90]  Emmanuel.
[960.90 --> 964.90]  The rescue for sinners.
[964.90 --> 968.90]  The ransom from heaven.

[971.90 --> 975.90]  All our hope is in you.

[998.90 --> 1004.90]  All in glory to you, God.
[1004.90 --> 1010.14]  The one of the world
[1010.14 --> 1013.86]  Jesus Messiah
[1013.86 --> 1021.42]  Name above all names
[1021.42 --> 1024.60]  Blessed Redeemer
[1024.60 --> 1028.22]  Emmanuel
[1028.22 --> 1035.10]  The rescue from sinners
[1035.10 --> 1040.14]  The ransom from heaven
[1040.14 --> 1045.30]  Jesus Messiah
[1045.30 --> 1050.76]  Lord of all
[1050.76 --> 1055.72]  Jesus Messiah
[1055.72 --> 1061.72]  Lord of all
[1061.72 --> 1077.10]  So the children are dismissed
[1077.10 --> 1080.00]  to go to their choir rehearsals.
[1080.00 --> 1082.26]  So we'll have choir rehearsal first with Angeline
[1082.26 --> 1084.64]  and then you'll go to your Sunday school class.
[1084.64 --> 1086.44]  So go ahead now.
[1096.00 --> 1099.56]  And we will here have a scripture reading
[1099.56 --> 1101.76]  before we continue on with our worship.
[1102.56 --> 1106.26]  So the reading here is from Luke chapter 1
[1106.26 --> 1110.30]  verses 46 to 55
[1110.30 --> 1113.14]  Luke chapter 1 46 to 55
[1113.14 --> 1116.26]  And Mary said
[1116.26 --> 1119.14]  My soul glorifies the Lord
[1119.14 --> 1122.68]  and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
[1122.68 --> 1125.22]  for he has been mindful
[1125.22 --> 1127.58]  of the humble state of his servant
[1127.58 --> 1131.30]  from now on all generations will call me blessed
[1131.30 --> 1134.64]  for the mighty one has done great things for me
[1134.64 --> 1136.26]  Holy is his name
[1136.26 --> 1139.72]  His mercy extends to those who fear him
[1139.72 --> 1142.54]  from generation to generation
[1142.54 --> 1146.12]  He has performed mighty deeds with his arm
[1146.12 --> 1150.72]  He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts
[1150.72 --> 1154.56]  He has brought down rulers and their thrones
[1154.56 --> 1156.90]  and has lifted up the humble
[1156.90 --> 1160.30]  He has filled the hungry with good things
[1160.30 --> 1163.22]  but has sent the rich away empty
[1163.22 --> 1166.98]  He has helped his servant Israel
[1166.98 --> 1169.36]  remembering to be merciful
[1169.36 --> 1172.56]  to Abraham and his descendants forever
[1172.56 --> 1175.28]  just as he promised our ancestors
[1175.28 --> 1178.82]  This is the reading of God's word
[1178.82 --> 1180.82]  Thanks be to God
[1180.82 --> 1196.36]  For our time of confession
[1196.36 --> 1200.16]  let us confess our sins before God and one another
[1200.16 --> 1201.36]  with these words
[1201.36 --> 1204.58]  Lord Jesus
[1204.58 --> 1207.76]  We confess our willingness to be loved
[1207.76 --> 1211.86]  but also our reluctance to love
[1211.86 --> 1216.88]  We confess our readiness to accept your forgiving love
[1216.88 --> 1220.62]  but also our refusal to forgive
[1220.62 --> 1226.98]  We confess our eagerness to grasp your offer of redeeming love
[1226.98 --> 1232.72]  but also our resistance to follow you without question
[1232.72 --> 1235.98]  In this Advent season
[1235.98 --> 1239.84]  Forgive us our failure to respond as we should
[1239.84 --> 1242.70]  Lord Jesus come to us anew
[1242.70 --> 1246.46]  and by your grace assist us to receive you
[1246.46 --> 1248.62]  with joy as the shepherds
[1248.62 --> 1251.16]  with gratitude as Simeon
[1251.16 --> 1253.66]  with obedience as Mary
[1253.66 --> 1257.22]  with love as you have loved us
[1257.22 --> 1259.26]  Even so
[1259.26 --> 1261.40]  Come Lord Jesus
[1261.40 --> 1262.44]  Amen
[1262.44 --> 1270.54]  God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness is from Zephaniah chapter 3
[1270.54 --> 1273.72]  Sing aloud
[1273.72 --> 1274.80]  O daughter Zion
[1274.80 --> 1275.84]  Shout
[1275.84 --> 1276.76]  O Israel
[1276.76 --> 1280.02]  Rejoice and exult with all your heart
[1280.02 --> 1281.16]  O daughter Jerusalem
[1281.16 --> 1285.36]  The Lord has taken away the judgments against you
[1285.36 --> 1288.04]  He has turned away your enemies
[1288.04 --> 1289.86]  The King of Israel
[1289.86 --> 1290.48]  The Lord
[1290.48 --> 1291.80]  is in your midst
[1291.80 --> 1293.86]  You shall fear disaster
[1293.86 --> 1294.96]  no more
[1294.96 --> 1300.12]  Please rise for our song of response
[1300.12 --> 1301.62]  Amen
[1301.62 --> 1301.68]  Amen
[1316.68 --> 1317.20]  Amen
[1317.20 --> 1318.98]  Amen
[1318.98 --> 1321.28]  Amen
[1321.28 --> 1321.54]  Amen
[1321.54 --> 1321.74]  Amen
[1321.94 --> 1326.70]  Amen
[1326.70 --> 1327.02]  Amen
[1327.02 --> 1327.58]  Amen
[1327.58 --> 1335.42]  We want for your appearing
[1335.42 --> 1343.74]  Take our despair, refresh our sight with vision
[1343.74 --> 1349.60]  Bright light hope within our hearts
[1349.60 --> 1357.18]  Light hope within our hearts
[1357.18 --> 1364.24]  We want for your appearing
[1364.24 --> 1370.24]  For comfort us, warm our souls
[1370.24 --> 1377.24]  Make us fall like peace within our hearts
[1377.24 --> 1385.10]  Like peace within our hearts
[1385.10 --> 1392.16]  We long for your appearing
[1392.16 --> 1397.74]  Dissolve our gloom, dispel our night
[1397.74 --> 1401.34]  Our souls sing bright
[1401.34 --> 1405.66]  Like joy within our hearts
[1405.66 --> 1412.72]  Like joy within our hearts
[1412.72 --> 1419.78]  We long for your appearing
[1419.78 --> 1425.78]  Destroy our hate, renew our will
[1425.78 --> 1428.84]  Our spirits fill
[1428.84 --> 1432.84]  Like love within our hearts
[1432.84 --> 1438.84]  Like love within our hearts
[1438.84 --> 1453.90]  We long for your hearts
[1453.90 --> 1466.96]  We long for your hearts
[1466.96 --> 1467.92]  And for those of you who do not know
[1467.92 --> 1469.86]  That is Marian's own composition
[1469.86 --> 1470.96]  That song we just sang
[1470.96 --> 1473.64]  So it's a lovely song to sing
[1473.64 --> 1476.06]  So good morning
[1476.06 --> 1478.42]  Today is the first Sunday
[1478.42 --> 1480.46]  In the church season of Advent
[1480.46 --> 1481.70]  This is the kickoff
[1481.70 --> 1484.06]  To the whole church year
[1484.06 --> 1485.92]  And this year
[1485.92 --> 1487.72]  For Advent, our series
[1487.72 --> 1489.36]  We will be looking at these
[1489.36 --> 1491.92]  Ancient Advent prayers
[1491.92 --> 1494.10]  Called the O antiphons
[1494.10 --> 1498.08]  So they begin with O
[1498.08 --> 1499.14]  Right?
[1499.26 --> 1500.22]  And this O
[1500.22 --> 1501.52]  What it means is
[1501.52 --> 1503.66]  Calling out to God
[1503.66 --> 1505.64]  And then
[1505.64 --> 1508.30]  Each of these antiphons
[1508.30 --> 1509.58]  Calls out to God
[1509.58 --> 1510.84]  Using one of the names
[1510.84 --> 1512.86]  Or titles for Christ
[1512.86 --> 1515.06]  That we find in the book of Isaiah
[1515.06 --> 1516.74]  And so
[1516.74 --> 1517.96]  Emmanuel
[1517.96 --> 1519.50]  Our own Emmanuel
[1519.50 --> 1520.22]  Not the
[1520.22 --> 1521.74]  Jesus Emmanuel
[1521.74 --> 1523.76]  Well he's ours too
[1523.76 --> 1523.96]  But
[1523.96 --> 1526.28]  So he did this artwork
[1526.28 --> 1527.02]  That you can see
[1527.02 --> 1527.92]  And so you can see
[1527.92 --> 1529.30]  The titles of Christ
[1529.30 --> 1529.96]  That we have
[1529.96 --> 1530.98]  Beginning here
[1530.98 --> 1532.32]  O wisdom come
[1532.32 --> 1533.92]  O Lord
[1533.92 --> 1535.10]  Root of Jesse
[1535.10 --> 1536.04]  Key of David
[1536.04 --> 1537.26]  Dayspring
[1537.26 --> 1538.60]  King of Nations
[1538.60 --> 1540.76]  And God with us
[1540.76 --> 1543.34]  So those are the seven titles
[1543.34 --> 1545.00]  That we see
[1545.00 --> 1546.10]  For Christ
[1546.10 --> 1547.58]  And we will
[1547.58 --> 1548.42]  What we'll be doing
[1548.42 --> 1549.72]  Is taking each one
[1549.72 --> 1550.64]  Of these antiphons
[1550.64 --> 1551.98]  One each week
[1551.98 --> 1554.20]  And just asking this question
[1554.20 --> 1555.38]  What do these titles
[1555.38 --> 1556.76]  Tell us about Jesus?
[1557.68 --> 1558.24]  And
[1558.24 --> 1560.74]  What do they promise us?
[1560.88 --> 1562.06]  Why are they such
[1562.06 --> 1563.66]  Good news
[1563.66 --> 1564.88]  For us?
[1565.82 --> 1566.86]  And this morning
[1566.86 --> 1567.88]  We'll be continuing
[1567.88 --> 1569.80]  With our second antiphon
[1569.80 --> 1571.06]  We started a week early
[1571.06 --> 1571.64]  Last week
[1571.64 --> 1573.86]  And today's antiphon
[1573.86 --> 1574.36]  Is
[1574.36 --> 1576.08]  O Lord
[1576.08 --> 1577.34]  Or
[1577.34 --> 1579.48]  O Adonai
[1579.48 --> 1581.06]  So let's read
[1581.06 --> 1582.12]  The antiphon together
[1582.12 --> 1584.24]  Before we continue
[1584.24 --> 1585.68]  So here is the antiphon
[1585.68 --> 1587.06]  And let's read it together
[1587.06 --> 1589.02]  O Adonai
[1589.02 --> 1590.10]  And leader
[1590.10 --> 1591.00]  Of the house
[1591.00 --> 1591.76]  Of Israel
[1591.76 --> 1593.20]  Who appeared
[1593.20 --> 1593.92]  To Moses
[1593.92 --> 1595.04]  In the fire
[1595.04 --> 1596.40]  Of the burning bush
[1596.40 --> 1597.90]  And gave him
[1597.90 --> 1598.58]  The law
[1598.58 --> 1599.56]  On Sinai
[1599.56 --> 1601.82]  Come and redeem us
[1601.82 --> 1603.96]  With an outstretched arm
[1603.96 --> 1606.50]  So our second
[1606.50 --> 1607.26]  O antiphon
[1607.26 --> 1607.74]  Is
[1607.74 --> 1608.60]  O Lord
[1608.60 --> 1609.22]  Or
[1609.22 --> 1610.82]  O Adonai
[1610.82 --> 1612.64]  And that title
[1612.64 --> 1613.42]  If you're not familiar
[1613.42 --> 1614.16]  Adonai
[1614.16 --> 1615.58]  It is a Hebrew word
[1615.58 --> 1617.46]  And it touches
[1617.46 --> 1618.78]  On the very name
[1619.32 --> 1619.78]  Of God
[1620.46 --> 1621.26]  Himself
[1621.26 --> 1623.14]  And it's the name
[1623.14 --> 1624.24]  Yahweh
[1624.24 --> 1625.08]  That's probably how
[1625.08 --> 1625.50]  It's pronounced
[1625.50 --> 1626.04]  Yahweh
[1626.04 --> 1627.36]  That's God's
[1627.36 --> 1628.26]  Proper name
[1628.26 --> 1629.84]  But the Jews
[1629.84 --> 1630.90]  Came to believe
[1630.90 --> 1631.72]  That God's name
[1631.72 --> 1633.26]  Was too holy
[1633.26 --> 1634.86]  To speak aloud
[1634.86 --> 1636.30]  In other words
[1636.30 --> 1638.16]  No lips were clean enough
[1638.16 --> 1639.70]  To say the name
[1639.70 --> 1640.26]  Of God
[1640.26 --> 1642.30]  And so in the synagogue
[1642.30 --> 1643.38]  You couldn't say
[1643.38 --> 1644.08]  That name
[1644.08 --> 1644.54]  Instead
[1644.54 --> 1645.86]  You would say
[1645.86 --> 1647.16]  Adonai
[1647.16 --> 1648.06]  Meaning
[1648.06 --> 1649.10]  Lord
[1649.10 --> 1650.80]  So now
[1650.80 --> 1651.70]  You'll also notice
[1651.70 --> 1652.82]  With the antiphon
[1652.82 --> 1654.58]  That it harkens back
[1654.58 --> 1655.34]  To the story
[1655.34 --> 1655.90]  In the Bible
[1655.90 --> 1656.56]  Of Moses
[1656.56 --> 1658.14]  And the burning bush
[1658.14 --> 1659.86]  So if you remember
[1659.86 --> 1660.42]  The story
[1660.42 --> 1661.48]  Moses
[1661.48 --> 1662.64]  He's a shepherd
[1662.64 --> 1663.38]  He's out there
[1663.38 --> 1663.92]  In the desert
[1663.92 --> 1664.52]  In the wilderness
[1664.52 --> 1666.14]  And one day
[1666.14 --> 1667.28]  While he is out
[1667.28 --> 1668.06]  With his sheep
[1668.06 --> 1669.96]  He sees a bush
[1669.96 --> 1671.64]  That is burning
[1671.64 --> 1674.28]  Now a burning bush
[1674.28 --> 1675.34]  In itself
[1675.34 --> 1677.34]  Is not that strange
[1677.34 --> 1677.88]  Of a thing
[1677.88 --> 1678.18]  Right?
[1678.74 --> 1679.48]  Bushes burning
[1679.48 --> 1680.04]  In the desert
[1680.04 --> 1681.10]  Is not unusual
[1681.10 --> 1682.76]  It happens all the time
[1682.76 --> 1683.34]  Right?
[1683.40 --> 1684.88]  There were lightning strikes
[1684.88 --> 1686.42]  There were campfires
[1686.42 --> 1687.50]  That went astray
[1687.50 --> 1689.32]  And so brush fires
[1689.32 --> 1690.02]  Would happen
[1690.02 --> 1692.24]  But they would burn out
[1692.24 --> 1692.90]  Very quickly
[1692.90 --> 1694.32]  And so what
[1694.32 --> 1695.82]  Attracts Moses' attention
[1695.82 --> 1697.00]  Is that the bush
[1697.00 --> 1697.66]  Is burning
[1697.66 --> 1699.96]  But it's not burning out
[1699.96 --> 1700.56]  Right?
[1700.60 --> 1701.56]  It's not consumed
[1701.56 --> 1704.68]  It just keeps on burning
[1704.68 --> 1706.34]  That's unusual
[1706.34 --> 1707.46]  So Moses
[1707.46 --> 1708.48]  He turns aside
[1708.48 --> 1709.50]  He goes over
[1709.50 --> 1710.24]  To check it out
[1710.24 --> 1711.06]  And that's when
[1711.06 --> 1712.42]  God meets
[1712.42 --> 1713.26]  With Moses
[1713.26 --> 1715.16]  In the burning bush
[1715.16 --> 1716.92]  And God reveals
[1716.92 --> 1718.66]  His own name
[1718.66 --> 1719.98]  To Moses
[1719.98 --> 1720.64]  The name
[1720.64 --> 1721.64]  Yahweh
[1721.64 --> 1722.92]  And so this is
[1722.92 --> 1724.06]  The covenant name
[1724.06 --> 1725.64]  That God has
[1725.64 --> 1726.56]  With his people
[1726.56 --> 1729.58]  And for the early Christians
[1729.58 --> 1732.16]  This ordinary bush
[1732.16 --> 1733.46]  In the desert
[1733.46 --> 1735.38]  Ablazed with the presence
[1735.38 --> 1736.02]  Of God
[1736.02 --> 1737.24]  And yet not consumed
[1737.24 --> 1738.60]  Was a sign
[1738.60 --> 1739.68]  Of the Lord Christ
[1739.68 --> 1740.30]  Who would come
[1740.30 --> 1741.54]  Who would be
[1741.54 --> 1743.10]  Both fully God
[1743.10 --> 1745.16]  And fully human
[1745.16 --> 1747.08]  Divine in humanity
[1747.08 --> 1748.12]  In one
[1748.12 --> 1749.10]  And that's the image
[1749.10 --> 1750.04]  Of the burning bush
[1750.04 --> 1752.30]  So now when we come
[1752.30 --> 1752.92]  To Isaiah
[1752.92 --> 1754.00]  One of the titles
[1754.00 --> 1755.84]  That Isaiah uses
[1755.84 --> 1757.04]  For Christ
[1757.04 --> 1757.72]  Is
[1757.72 --> 1759.12]  Lord
[1759.12 --> 1761.16]  And as Christians
[1761.16 --> 1761.48]  You know
[1761.48 --> 1762.36]  We say that all the time
[1762.36 --> 1762.74]  Don't we?
[1763.66 --> 1764.78]  The Lord Jesus
[1764.78 --> 1766.46]  And what that means
[1766.46 --> 1767.44]  Is that he is
[1767.44 --> 1768.24]  Yahweh
[1768.24 --> 1768.90]  Right?
[1768.96 --> 1770.06]  He is the God
[1770.06 --> 1771.00]  Of Israel
[1771.00 --> 1772.40]  He is this God
[1772.40 --> 1773.34]  Who revealed himself
[1773.34 --> 1773.88]  To Moses
[1773.88 --> 1774.86]  In the burning bush
[1774.86 --> 1776.34]  Who gave the law
[1776.34 --> 1777.26]  On Mount Sinai
[1777.26 --> 1778.76]  Who has
[1778.76 --> 1779.76]  Rule
[1779.76 --> 1780.68]  And authority
[1780.68 --> 1782.36]  Over his people
[1782.36 --> 1783.58]  He is
[1783.58 --> 1784.48]  The Lord
[1784.48 --> 1786.18]  And so with that
[1786.18 --> 1787.22]  Background in mind
[1787.22 --> 1787.80]  Let's go ahead
[1787.80 --> 1788.74]  And read our passage
[1788.74 --> 1789.92]  For this morning
[1789.92 --> 1792.16]  Isaiah chapter 11
[1792.16 --> 1793.22]  So if you
[1793.22 --> 1794.62]  Open your pew bible
[1794.62 --> 1795.54]  It is on page
[1795.54 --> 1796.78]  518
[1796.78 --> 1801.62]  Page 518
[1801.62 --> 1805.50]  So in solidarity
[1805.50 --> 1806.14]  With you
[1806.14 --> 1807.22]  I'm going to flip open
[1807.22 --> 1807.72]  My bible
[1807.72 --> 1808.58]  Instead of reading it
[1808.58 --> 1809.12]  From the screen
[1809.12 --> 1811.06]  So Isaiah
[1811.06 --> 1812.96]  11
[1812.96 --> 1814.20]  Let's see who can
[1814.20 --> 1814.82]  Find it first
[1814.82 --> 1816.08]  You might beat me
[1816.08 --> 1819.34]  Okay
[1819.34 --> 1822.68]  Isaiah 11
[1822.68 --> 1824.34]  Verses 2
[1824.34 --> 1825.68]  Through 9
[1825.68 --> 1827.78]  Let's give our attention
[1827.78 --> 1828.28]  To the reading
[1828.28 --> 1828.88]  Of God's word
[1828.88 --> 1831.18]  The spirit
[1831.18 --> 1831.88]  Of the Lord
[1831.88 --> 1833.16]  Will rest on him
[1833.16 --> 1834.74]  The spirit
[1834.74 --> 1835.52]  Of wisdom
[1835.52 --> 1837.14]  And of understanding
[1837.14 --> 1838.80]  The spirit
[1838.80 --> 1839.84]  Of counsel
[1839.84 --> 1841.86]  And of power
[1841.86 --> 1843.44]  The spirit
[1843.44 --> 1844.40]  Of knowledge
[1844.40 --> 1845.98]  And of the fear
[1845.98 --> 1846.72]  Of the Lord
[1846.72 --> 1848.50]  And he will delight
[1848.50 --> 1849.52]  In the fear
[1849.52 --> 1850.16]  Of the Lord
[1850.16 --> 1852.20]  He will not judge
[1852.20 --> 1853.24]  By what he sees
[1853.24 --> 1854.20]  With his eyes
[1854.20 --> 1855.62]  Or decide
[1855.62 --> 1856.88]  By what he hears
[1856.88 --> 1857.84]  With his ears
[1857.84 --> 1859.56]  But with righteousness
[1859.56 --> 1860.48]  He will judge
[1860.48 --> 1861.18]  The needy
[1861.18 --> 1862.80]  With justice
[1862.80 --> 1864.44]  He will give decisions
[1864.44 --> 1865.36]  For the poor
[1865.36 --> 1866.06]  Of the earth
[1866.06 --> 1869.74]  He will strike
[1869.74 --> 1870.34]  The earth
[1870.34 --> 1871.06]  With the rod
[1871.06 --> 1871.74]  Of his mouth
[1871.74 --> 1873.06]  With the breath
[1873.06 --> 1873.80]  Of his lips
[1873.80 --> 1874.98]  He will slay
[1874.98 --> 1875.54]  The wicked
[1875.54 --> 1877.00]  Righteousness
[1877.00 --> 1878.04]  Will be his belt
[1878.04 --> 1879.36]  And faithfulness
[1879.36 --> 1879.98]  The sash
[1879.98 --> 1881.00]  Around his waist
[1881.00 --> 1882.46]  The wolf
[1882.46 --> 1882.96]  Will live
[1882.96 --> 1883.80]  With the lamb
[1883.80 --> 1885.10]  The leopard
[1885.10 --> 1885.94]  Will lie down
[1885.94 --> 1886.56]  With the goat
[1886.56 --> 1887.88]  The calf
[1887.88 --> 1888.52]  And the lion
[1888.52 --> 1889.32]  And the yearling
[1889.32 --> 1889.76]  Together
[1889.76 --> 1891.16]  And a little child
[1891.16 --> 1891.86]  Will lead them
[1891.86 --> 1893.56]  The cow
[1893.56 --> 1894.06]  Will feed
[1894.06 --> 1894.66]  With the bear
[1894.66 --> 1895.26]  And the young
[1895.26 --> 1896.18]  Will lie down
[1896.18 --> 1896.58]  Together
[1896.58 --> 1897.84]  And the lion
[1897.84 --> 1898.56]  Will eat straw
[1898.56 --> 1899.38]  Like the ox
[1899.38 --> 1900.74]  The infant
[1900.74 --> 1901.26]  Will play
[1901.26 --> 1901.92]  Near the hole
[1901.92 --> 1902.54]  Of the cobra
[1902.54 --> 1903.86]  And the young child
[1903.86 --> 1904.74]  Put his hand
[1904.74 --> 1906.02]  Into the viper's nest
[1906.02 --> 1907.76]  They will neither harm
[1907.76 --> 1908.60]  Nor destroy
[1908.60 --> 1910.00]  On all my holy mountain
[1910.00 --> 1911.26]  For the earth
[1911.26 --> 1911.96]  Will be full
[1911.96 --> 1912.72]  Of the knowledge
[1912.72 --> 1913.32]  Of the lord
[1913.32 --> 1915.16]  As the waters
[1915.16 --> 1916.54]  Cover the sea
[1916.54 --> 1918.58]  This is the word
[1918.58 --> 1919.08]  Of the lord
[1919.08 --> 1921.88]  Let's pray
[1921.88 --> 1922.36]  And let's ask
[1922.36 --> 1923.34]  For god's blessing
[1923.34 --> 1924.82]  Upon the reading
[1924.82 --> 1925.26]  And the preaching
[1925.26 --> 1925.80]  Of his word
[1925.80 --> 1928.06]  Heavenly father
[1928.06 --> 1929.74]  Isaiah tells us
[1929.74 --> 1930.92]  The grass withers
[1930.92 --> 1932.90]  The flowers fall
[1932.90 --> 1933.66]  But the word
[1933.66 --> 1934.84]  Of our god
[1934.84 --> 1936.20]  Endures forever
[1936.20 --> 1938.64]  And so father
[1938.64 --> 1939.36]  We thank you
[1939.36 --> 1940.00]  This morning
[1940.00 --> 1940.86]  For your word
[1940.86 --> 1942.40]  That it is true
[1942.40 --> 1943.70]  And that you give it
[1943.70 --> 1944.58]  To us in love
[1944.58 --> 1946.48]  And that your promises
[1946.48 --> 1947.60]  Will never fail
[1947.60 --> 1949.12]  And so lord
[1949.12 --> 1950.14]  We ask for your blessing
[1950.14 --> 1950.96]  Upon us now
[1950.96 --> 1951.86]  As we open
[1951.86 --> 1952.70]  Your word together
[1952.70 --> 1954.04]  And lord
[1954.04 --> 1954.56]  We ask that you
[1954.56 --> 1955.18]  Would stir
[1955.18 --> 1957.42]  A deeper desire
[1957.42 --> 1958.64]  In our hearts
[1958.64 --> 1960.10]  For your coming
[1960.10 --> 1962.04]  We pray in Jesus name
[1962.04 --> 1963.04]  And for his sake
[1963.04 --> 1964.10]  Amen
[1964.10 --> 1967.62]  So one of the cartoons
[1967.62 --> 1968.82]  I used to watch
[1968.82 --> 1969.90]  As a young boy
[1969.90 --> 1971.36]  Growing up
[1971.36 --> 1972.60]  Is G.I. Joe
[1972.60 --> 1973.96]  I don't know
[1973.96 --> 1974.54]  If you are like
[1974.54 --> 1975.36]  Too old
[1975.36 --> 1976.04]  Or too young
[1976.04 --> 1976.58]  Or whatever
[1976.58 --> 1977.28]  But has anybody
[1977.28 --> 1978.52]  Seen G.I. Joe
[1978.52 --> 1979.96]  Okay
[1979.96 --> 1980.60]  A couple of you
[1980.60 --> 1981.44]  That's good
[1981.44 --> 1982.82]  So I don't know
[1982.82 --> 1983.30]  If you remember
[1983.30 --> 1983.94]  If you've seen it
[1983.94 --> 1984.84]  But at the end
[1984.84 --> 1985.92]  Of all of these episodes
[1985.92 --> 1986.66]  There would be
[1986.66 --> 1988.08]  A public service
[1988.08 --> 1988.68]  Announcement
[1988.68 --> 1991.04]  So for example
[1991.04 --> 1992.70]  In one episode
[1992.70 --> 1993.22]  There would be
[1993.22 --> 1994.14]  A young boy
[1994.14 --> 1995.40]  Walking with his
[1995.40 --> 1996.04]  Older brothers
[1996.04 --> 1996.64]  And they're kind of
[1996.64 --> 1997.44]  Like at a carnival
[1997.44 --> 1997.96]  Or a fair
[1997.96 --> 1999.12]  It's a very crowded place
[1999.12 --> 2000.22]  And the young boy
[2000.22 --> 2001.06]  Gets separated
[2001.06 --> 2001.84]  From his brothers
[2001.84 --> 2002.76]  And he's lost
[2002.76 --> 2003.80]  And it's a scary
[2003.80 --> 2005.36]  Experience for a young kid
[2005.36 --> 2006.84]  So then one of the
[2006.84 --> 2008.02]  G.I. Joe heroes
[2008.02 --> 2009.18]  Just appears
[2009.18 --> 2009.94]  On the scene
[2009.94 --> 2011.30]  And he teaches the boy
[2011.30 --> 2011.94]  What to do
[2011.94 --> 2012.64]  Right
[2012.64 --> 2013.36]  Don't panic
[2013.36 --> 2015.70]  Go back to the place
[2015.70 --> 2016.78]  Where you last saw them
[2016.78 --> 2019.16]  If you don't see them
[2019.16 --> 2020.34]  Ask a police officer
[2020.34 --> 2020.94]  To help you
[2020.94 --> 2021.54]  Right
[2021.54 --> 2021.92]  And so
[2021.92 --> 2022.92]  It's good advice
[2022.92 --> 2023.62]  I think I actually
[2023.62 --> 2024.22]  Learned a lot
[2024.22 --> 2025.38]  From G.I. Joe
[2025.38 --> 2027.96]  But then it always
[2027.96 --> 2029.02]  Ended with the kid
[2029.02 --> 2029.54]  Saying
[2029.54 --> 2031.12]  Now I know
[2031.12 --> 2032.78]  And the G.I. Joe
[2032.78 --> 2033.86]  Guy would respond
[2033.86 --> 2036.06]  You don't know
[2036.06 --> 2036.24]  Okay
[2036.24 --> 2037.14]  And knowing
[2037.14 --> 2039.04]  Is half the battle
[2039.04 --> 2040.36]  It's actually
[2040.36 --> 2041.02]  Kind of liturgical
[2041.02 --> 2041.24]  Right
[2041.24 --> 2042.02]  This call and response
[2042.02 --> 2042.60]  And now
[2042.60 --> 2044.02]  I know
[2044.02 --> 2045.00]  And knowing
[2045.00 --> 2046.18]  Is half the battle
[2046.18 --> 2048.20]  So last week
[2048.20 --> 2049.42]  We looked at this title
[2049.42 --> 2050.26]  Oh wisdom
[2050.26 --> 2052.68]  And we desperately
[2052.68 --> 2053.46]  Need a savior
[2053.46 --> 2054.60]  Who is marked
[2054.60 --> 2055.18]  By wisdom
[2055.18 --> 2055.94]  Right
[2055.94 --> 2056.80]  We need a savior
[2056.80 --> 2057.62]  Who can
[2057.62 --> 2059.66]  Sweetly order
[2059.66 --> 2060.64]  Our hearts
[2060.64 --> 2061.76]  And our lives
[2061.76 --> 2062.38]  Right
[2062.38 --> 2063.02]  Someone who can
[2063.02 --> 2064.12]  Disentangle
[2064.12 --> 2066.10]  Us from the sin
[2066.10 --> 2067.26]  That we are enmeshed in
[2067.26 --> 2068.52]  And teach us
[2068.52 --> 2069.34]  To walk in the ways
[2069.34 --> 2069.74]  Of God
[2069.74 --> 2071.82]  But the problem is
[2071.82 --> 2072.78]  Often wisdom
[2072.78 --> 2074.44]  Is not enough
[2074.44 --> 2075.78]  Right
[2075.78 --> 2076.32]  It's one thing
[2076.32 --> 2076.84]  To know
[2076.84 --> 2077.42]  The right thing
[2077.42 --> 2077.82]  To do
[2077.82 --> 2078.28]  But what
[2078.28 --> 2079.00]  If you're not
[2079.00 --> 2079.46]  Able
[2079.46 --> 2080.48]  To do it
[2080.48 --> 2082.54]  If knowing
[2082.54 --> 2083.96]  Is half the battle
[2083.96 --> 2086.32]  Well that leaves me
[2086.32 --> 2087.12]  Halfway there
[2087.12 --> 2087.46]  But
[2087.46 --> 2088.92]  But I
[2088.92 --> 2089.60]  Still
[2089.60 --> 2090.96]  Need the other
[2090.96 --> 2091.64]  Half
[2091.64 --> 2094.04]  And in Christ
[2094.04 --> 2095.00]  When we call out
[2095.00 --> 2095.42]  To God
[2095.42 --> 2096.04]  In our need
[2096.04 --> 2096.68]  We call out
[2096.68 --> 2097.74]  Oh wisdom
[2097.74 --> 2098.42]  Come
[2098.42 --> 2098.50]  Come
[2098.50 --> 2100.30]  And we cry
[2100.30 --> 2101.30]  Oh Lord
[2101.30 --> 2101.92]  Come
[2101.92 --> 2102.74]  We are promised
[2102.74 --> 2103.58]  Both wisdom
[2103.58 --> 2105.30]  And strength
[2105.30 --> 2107.26]  And so Isaiah
[2107.26 --> 2107.90]  Here is looking
[2107.90 --> 2108.66]  Forward to Jesus
[2108.66 --> 2109.64]  As the wisdom
[2109.64 --> 2110.28]  Of God
[2110.28 --> 2111.38]  The one who has
[2111.38 --> 2112.36]  The spirit of wisdom
[2112.36 --> 2113.18]  And understanding
[2113.18 --> 2115.32]  And he looks
[2115.32 --> 2115.76]  Forward
[2115.76 --> 2117.10]  To him
[2117.10 --> 2118.88]  As the Lord
[2118.88 --> 2120.26]  The one who
[2120.26 --> 2121.50]  Can redeem us
[2121.50 --> 2122.46]  With an outstretched
[2122.46 --> 2122.88]  Arm
[2122.88 --> 2125.46]  So in this passage
[2125.46 --> 2126.84]  In Isaiah chapter 11
[2126.84 --> 2128.26]  Isaiah gives us a picture
[2128.26 --> 2130.28]  Of several ways
[2130.28 --> 2131.84]  That Christ's wisdom
[2131.84 --> 2132.92]  Gets worked out
[2132.92 --> 2134.60]  In the way that he leads us
[2134.60 --> 2135.18]  As his people
[2135.18 --> 2137.02]  In the way that he rules over us
[2137.02 --> 2139.16]  And so that's what we're going to look at
[2139.16 --> 2139.58]  This morning
[2139.58 --> 2140.94]  The rule of Christ
[2140.94 --> 2142.60]  And the strength
[2142.60 --> 2144.68]  That his rule brings
[2144.68 --> 2147.06]  And there's a few things
[2147.06 --> 2148.94]  I want us to notice
[2148.94 --> 2149.62]  Here in the passage
[2149.62 --> 2150.38]  And the first
[2150.38 --> 2152.50]  Is that Isaiah pictures
[2152.50 --> 2153.38]  The coming Messiah
[2153.38 --> 2154.88]  As someone who is empowered
[2154.88 --> 2155.80]  By the Holy Spirit
[2155.80 --> 2156.66]  Who is
[2156.66 --> 2157.22]  His rule
[2157.22 --> 2159.38]  Is spirit empowered
[2159.38 --> 2160.78]  And we see that
[2160.78 --> 2161.32]  Right at the beginning
[2161.32 --> 2161.96]  Of our passage
[2161.96 --> 2162.98]  In verse 2
[2162.98 --> 2165.12]  It says this
[2165.12 --> 2166.44]  The spirit of the Lord
[2166.44 --> 2167.40]  Will rest on him
[2167.40 --> 2169.26]  The spirit of wisdom
[2169.26 --> 2170.58]  And of understanding
[2170.58 --> 2171.96]  The spirit of counsel
[2171.96 --> 2172.40]  And might
[2172.40 --> 2173.96]  The spirit of the knowledge
[2173.96 --> 2175.36]  And fear of the Lord
[2175.36 --> 2176.18]  So notice spirit
[2176.18 --> 2177.02]  Four times
[2177.02 --> 2177.86]  In this one verse
[2177.86 --> 2180.04]  The spirit of the Lord
[2180.04 --> 2182.16]  Will rest on him
[2182.16 --> 2185.36]  Right from the start
[2185.36 --> 2185.74]  You know
[2185.74 --> 2186.68]  When we look at Jesus
[2186.68 --> 2187.40]  His ministry
[2187.40 --> 2188.14]  We see
[2188.14 --> 2189.38]  This empowering
[2189.38 --> 2190.76]  That he receives
[2190.76 --> 2191.64]  From the Holy Spirit
[2191.64 --> 2193.24]  Right at the very start
[2193.24 --> 2193.86]  Of his ministry
[2193.86 --> 2195.68]  He goes into a synagogue
[2195.68 --> 2196.68]  In Nazareth
[2196.68 --> 2197.50]  His hometown
[2197.50 --> 2199.54]  And during the service
[2199.54 --> 2200.50]  He opens up
[2200.50 --> 2201.86]  The scroll of Isaiah
[2201.86 --> 2202.30]  Right
[2202.30 --> 2204.14]  To Isaiah 61
[2204.14 --> 2205.90]  And this is recorded
[2205.90 --> 2207.02]  In Luke chapter 4
[2207.02 --> 2208.70]  And this is what
[2208.70 --> 2209.82]  Jesus reads
[2209.82 --> 2211.06]  Quoting from Isaiah
[2211.06 --> 2213.52]  The spirit of the Lord
[2213.52 --> 2214.40]  Is on me
[2214.40 --> 2215.96]  Because he has
[2215.96 --> 2217.24]  Anointed me
[2217.24 --> 2218.98]  To proclaim
[2218.98 --> 2219.68]  Good news
[2219.68 --> 2220.32]  To the poor
[2220.32 --> 2221.72]  He has sent me
[2221.72 --> 2222.40]  To proclaim
[2222.40 --> 2222.98]  Freedom
[2222.98 --> 2224.56]  For the prisoners
[2224.56 --> 2225.56]  And recovery of sight
[2225.56 --> 2226.22]  For the blind
[2226.22 --> 2227.44]  To set the oppressed
[2227.44 --> 2227.86]  Free
[2227.86 --> 2229.12]  To proclaim the year
[2229.12 --> 2230.72]  Of the Lord's favor
[2230.72 --> 2232.58]  That word
[2232.58 --> 2233.24]  Anointed
[2233.24 --> 2234.46]  Is the word Messiah
[2234.46 --> 2235.20]  Or Christ
[2235.20 --> 2235.88]  Okay
[2235.88 --> 2236.68]  The spirit of the Lord
[2236.68 --> 2237.08]  Is on me
[2237.08 --> 2238.34]  He has anointed me
[2238.34 --> 2239.94]  So
[2239.94 --> 2241.88]  He gives the scroll back
[2241.88 --> 2242.72]  He sits down
[2242.72 --> 2244.02]  And everyone in the congregation
[2244.02 --> 2244.92]  Is just kind of
[2244.92 --> 2245.68]  Looking at him
[2245.68 --> 2247.20]  And he says
[2247.20 --> 2247.68]  Today
[2247.68 --> 2248.64]  This scripture
[2248.64 --> 2249.84]  Has been fulfilled
[2249.84 --> 2250.56]  In your hearing
[2250.56 --> 2252.58]  Right
[2252.58 --> 2253.84]  Jesus understood himself
[2253.84 --> 2254.82]  As the one
[2254.82 --> 2256.04]  With the spirit
[2256.04 --> 2256.64]  Of the Lord
[2256.64 --> 2258.88]  And we can see this
[2258.88 --> 2259.20]  You know
[2259.20 --> 2259.72]  In his
[2259.72 --> 2260.78]  So powerfully
[2260.78 --> 2261.54]  In his baptism
[2261.54 --> 2262.78]  All four of the gospels
[2262.78 --> 2263.26]  Record
[2263.26 --> 2264.70]  His baptism
[2264.70 --> 2266.86]  By the Holy Spirit
[2266.86 --> 2268.38]  So it records
[2268.38 --> 2268.96]  The Holy Spirit
[2268.96 --> 2269.56]  Descending
[2269.56 --> 2270.90]  From heaven
[2270.90 --> 2271.74]  Onto Jesus
[2271.74 --> 2272.44]  Like in the form
[2272.44 --> 2273.00]  Of a dove
[2273.00 --> 2274.34]  And it's all pointing
[2274.34 --> 2275.36]  Back to what Isaiah
[2275.36 --> 2276.04]  Says here
[2276.04 --> 2277.10]  In chapter 11
[2277.10 --> 2278.58]  Because Isaiah
[2278.58 --> 2279.24]  Promised
[2279.24 --> 2280.72]  The Messiah's ministry
[2280.72 --> 2281.64]  Would be anointed
[2281.64 --> 2282.62]  By the Holy Spirit
[2282.62 --> 2284.16]  And this is exactly
[2284.16 --> 2285.10]  What we see happening
[2285.10 --> 2286.06]  In Jesus' life
[2286.06 --> 2287.16]  Right
[2287.16 --> 2287.98]  And so even though
[2287.98 --> 2289.56]  Jesus is fully God
[2289.56 --> 2289.74]  Right
[2289.74 --> 2290.88]  He is that burning bush
[2290.88 --> 2292.14]  Both fully God
[2292.14 --> 2293.24]  And fully man
[2293.24 --> 2294.82]  And yet
[2294.82 --> 2296.22]  He needed the Holy Spirit
[2296.22 --> 2297.32]  To do
[2297.32 --> 2298.08]  What God
[2298.08 --> 2299.00]  Called him
[2299.00 --> 2299.88]  To do
[2299.88 --> 2301.62]  And so do we
[2301.62 --> 2302.32]  Right
[2302.32 --> 2302.92]  So do we
[2302.92 --> 2304.82]  So that's the first thing
[2304.82 --> 2305.56]  Isaiah tells us
[2305.56 --> 2306.50]  His rule is empowered
[2306.50 --> 2307.34]  By the Holy Spirit
[2307.34 --> 2309.28]  The second thing we see
[2309.28 --> 2310.96]  Is that his rule
[2310.96 --> 2312.28]  Is just
[2312.28 --> 2313.38]  Okay
[2313.38 --> 2314.02]  His rule
[2314.02 --> 2315.12]  Is just
[2315.12 --> 2316.82]  And we see this
[2316.82 --> 2317.40]  In the second
[2317.40 --> 2319.36]  Part of verse 3
[2319.36 --> 2321.46]  It says
[2321.46 --> 2323.72]  He will not judge
[2323.72 --> 2324.96]  By what he sees
[2324.96 --> 2325.76]  With his eyes
[2325.76 --> 2327.18]  Or decide
[2327.18 --> 2329.26]  By what he hears
[2329.26 --> 2330.38]  With his ears
[2330.38 --> 2332.70]  And that word judge
[2332.70 --> 2333.82]  It's not
[2333.82 --> 2336.62]  Judge as in discernment
[2336.62 --> 2338.10]  Kind of more like
[2338.10 --> 2338.40]  You know
[2338.40 --> 2339.00]  In your heart
[2339.00 --> 2339.76]  Or in your mind
[2339.76 --> 2340.84]  It's action
[2340.84 --> 2342.22]  The word means
[2342.22 --> 2342.98]  It's the act
[2342.98 --> 2344.68]  Of exercising authority
[2344.68 --> 2346.02]  It's the act
[2346.02 --> 2347.84]  Of passing judgment
[2347.84 --> 2350.60]  And Israel is talking
[2350.60 --> 2351.60]  About judging
[2351.60 --> 2353.36]  By appearances
[2353.36 --> 2354.62]  Right
[2354.62 --> 2355.68]  Even the best
[2355.68 --> 2357.02]  Human judge
[2357.02 --> 2358.50]  Can only go
[2358.50 --> 2360.40]  By what she sees
[2360.40 --> 2360.90]  Right
[2360.90 --> 2361.66]  You can only
[2361.66 --> 2362.60]  Make determinations
[2362.60 --> 2364.30]  Based on the evidence
[2364.30 --> 2365.84]  That is before you
[2365.84 --> 2367.26]  And if you've ever
[2367.26 --> 2368.26]  Seen a football game
[2368.26 --> 2368.86]  You know
[2368.86 --> 2369.96]  With instant replay
[2369.96 --> 2370.56]  You know
[2370.56 --> 2371.10]  What Isaiah
[2371.10 --> 2371.88]  Is talking about
[2371.88 --> 2372.82]  Right
[2372.82 --> 2373.34]  There are
[2373.34 --> 2374.88]  Just only
[2374.88 --> 2375.94]  So many
[2375.94 --> 2376.92]  Camera angles
[2376.92 --> 2378.04]  Right
[2378.04 --> 2378.70]  You can only
[2378.70 --> 2379.48]  Slow down
[2379.48 --> 2380.08]  The footage
[2380.08 --> 2380.90]  So much
[2380.90 --> 2381.48]  You can only
[2381.48 --> 2382.20]  Replay it
[2382.20 --> 2383.12]  So many times
[2383.12 --> 2384.48]  And still
[2384.48 --> 2385.24]  Sometimes
[2385.24 --> 2386.46]  You can't see
[2386.46 --> 2387.46]  Exactly what happened
[2387.46 --> 2389.44]  You need to make
[2389.44 --> 2390.96]  A judgment call
[2390.96 --> 2392.90]  But that is not
[2392.90 --> 2393.68]  How it is
[2393.68 --> 2394.70]  With Jesus' rule
[2394.70 --> 2395.48]  Right
[2395.48 --> 2396.46]  He does not judge
[2396.46 --> 2397.48]  Merely by what
[2397.48 --> 2398.28]  His eyes see
[2398.28 --> 2399.56]  Or what his ears hear
[2399.56 --> 2401.92]  Because of his wisdom
[2401.92 --> 2403.14]  Because he is
[2403.14 --> 2404.04]  Anointed by the
[2404.04 --> 2404.76]  Holy Spirit
[2404.76 --> 2406.08]  Jesus judges
[2406.08 --> 2407.12]  Based on what
[2407.12 --> 2408.42]  Is true
[2408.42 --> 2409.82]  What is true
[2409.82 --> 2410.64]  No matter what
[2410.64 --> 2411.74]  We can perceive
[2411.74 --> 2412.96]  Right
[2412.96 --> 2414.26]  He doesn't miss anything
[2414.26 --> 2415.56]  His judgments
[2415.56 --> 2416.24]  Are always
[2416.24 --> 2417.18]  Just and true
[2417.18 --> 2418.96]  You know
[2418.96 --> 2419.88]  And so think about
[2419.88 --> 2420.76]  Some time
[2420.76 --> 2421.44]  When you were
[2421.44 --> 2423.18]  Treated unfairly
[2423.18 --> 2424.64]  Right
[2424.64 --> 2425.10]  When like
[2425.10 --> 2425.96]  No matter what
[2425.96 --> 2426.64]  You said
[2426.64 --> 2427.66]  Or how you
[2427.66 --> 2428.40]  Tried to explain
[2428.40 --> 2428.76]  Things
[2428.76 --> 2429.24]  The person
[2429.24 --> 2430.32]  Just wouldn't
[2430.32 --> 2430.76]  Get it
[2430.76 --> 2431.50]  They couldn't
[2431.50 --> 2432.20]  Understand it
[2432.20 --> 2433.04]  The way you do
[2433.04 --> 2434.38]  You know
[2434.38 --> 2435.84]  And for you kids
[2435.84 --> 2437.26]  I know you know
[2437.26 --> 2438.06]  What that is like
[2438.06 --> 2438.98]  Right
[2438.98 --> 2440.02]  You know the frustration
[2440.02 --> 2441.02]  Of trying to explain
[2441.02 --> 2441.72]  What happened
[2441.72 --> 2442.68]  And your parents
[2442.68 --> 2444.08]  Just don't get it
[2444.08 --> 2445.14]  You know
[2445.14 --> 2446.10]  Maybe they blame you
[2446.10 --> 2446.92]  For something that
[2446.92 --> 2448.44]  Your brother or sister did
[2448.44 --> 2451.28]  See that doesn't happen
[2451.28 --> 2453.28]  Under Jesus' rule
[2453.28 --> 2455.42]  He doesn't judge
[2455.42 --> 2457.00]  Based on the surface level
[2457.00 --> 2458.80]  Based on whatever evidence
[2458.80 --> 2459.52]  He can find
[2459.52 --> 2460.26]  His judgment
[2460.26 --> 2461.88]  His rule as Lord
[2461.88 --> 2463.40]  Is completely fair
[2463.40 --> 2465.12]  And completely just
[2465.12 --> 2465.88]  He knows
[2465.88 --> 2467.82]  What is true
[2467.82 --> 2469.12]  He knows what's going on
[2469.12 --> 2471.52]  So that is
[2471.52 --> 2472.22]  The rule
[2472.22 --> 2473.50]  Of Jesus
[2473.50 --> 2475.08]  He is just
[2475.08 --> 2477.48]  And then the third thing
[2477.48 --> 2478.78]  Isaiah talks about
[2478.78 --> 2480.30]  Is the Lord's rule
[2480.30 --> 2481.20]  Is righteous
[2481.20 --> 2483.58]  His rule is righteous
[2483.58 --> 2484.54]  And going
[2484.54 --> 2485.72]  Continuing in our passage
[2485.72 --> 2486.74]  We see that in verse 4
[2486.74 --> 2488.68]  It says
[2488.68 --> 2489.56]  But with righteousness
[2489.56 --> 2491.08]  He will judge the needy
[2491.08 --> 2492.16]  With justice
[2492.16 --> 2493.76]  He will give decisions
[2493.76 --> 2495.40]  For the poor
[2495.40 --> 2496.24]  Of the earth
[2496.24 --> 2497.70]  Okay so now
[2497.70 --> 2498.56]  This is developing
[2498.56 --> 2499.68]  What we've just talked about
[2499.68 --> 2501.66]  Because who in particular
[2501.66 --> 2503.18]  Needs someone to judge
[2503.18 --> 2505.06]  In a way that goes deeper
[2505.06 --> 2506.68]  Than mere appearances
[2506.68 --> 2510.08]  It's those without power
[2510.08 --> 2511.76]  It's the poor
[2511.76 --> 2512.84]  And the needy
[2512.84 --> 2513.56]  And the marginalized
[2513.56 --> 2516.14]  And in Jesus' kingdom
[2516.14 --> 2517.32]  They are the ones
[2517.32 --> 2518.18]  Who are finally
[2518.18 --> 2519.74]  Treated as
[2519.74 --> 2520.58]  They should be
[2520.58 --> 2523.06]  And this is what
[2523.06 --> 2523.90]  Is so different
[2523.90 --> 2525.30]  About Jesus' rule
[2525.30 --> 2525.88]  Right
[2525.88 --> 2526.94]  He doesn't oppress
[2526.94 --> 2528.06]  The poor and needy
[2528.06 --> 2529.32]  To his own advantage
[2529.32 --> 2530.54]  Like so many of our
[2530.54 --> 2531.58]  Rulers and kings
[2531.58 --> 2532.94]  In this world
[2532.94 --> 2535.76]  But even more than that
[2535.76 --> 2536.98]  Not only does he not
[2536.98 --> 2538.50]  Oppress the poor and needy
[2538.50 --> 2540.56]  He is gentle
[2540.56 --> 2542.84]  Friends he is so gentle
[2542.84 --> 2544.68]  Isaiah says this
[2544.68 --> 2545.32]  About Christ
[2545.32 --> 2546.42]  In chapter 42
[2546.42 --> 2547.04]  Verse 3
[2547.04 --> 2550.12]  A bruised reed
[2550.12 --> 2551.72]  He will not break
[2551.72 --> 2554.28]  In a smoldering wick
[2554.28 --> 2556.90]  He will not snuff out
[2556.90 --> 2558.50]  In faithfulness
[2558.50 --> 2559.66]  He will bring forth justice
[2559.66 --> 2560.98]  He will not falter
[2560.98 --> 2562.12]  Or be discouraged
[2562.12 --> 2564.40]  Till he establishes justice
[2564.40 --> 2565.78]  On the earth
[2565.78 --> 2569.42]  And so this ruler
[2569.42 --> 2570.88]  That God promises
[2570.88 --> 2573.06]  He is powerful
[2573.06 --> 2573.62]  Right
[2573.62 --> 2575.52]  He will faithfully
[2575.52 --> 2576.82]  Bring forth justice
[2576.82 --> 2578.88]  He is able to do it
[2578.88 --> 2581.32]  But how does he do it?
[2581.44 --> 2582.88]  How does he bring forth justice?
[2583.74 --> 2585.02]  With gentleness
[2585.02 --> 2586.14]  Okay
[2586.14 --> 2586.76]  With gentleness
[2586.76 --> 2587.74]  He is powerful
[2587.74 --> 2588.84]  But in the most
[2588.84 --> 2590.54]  Counterintuitive way
[2590.54 --> 2592.28]  In a way that we don't often
[2592.28 --> 2593.78]  Expect or experience
[2593.78 --> 2594.54]  In this world
[2594.54 --> 2596.96]  In this passage
[2596.96 --> 2598.06]  Jesus quotes it
[2598.06 --> 2599.40]  He quotes it in Matthew
[2599.40 --> 2600.62]  Chapter 12
[2600.62 --> 2601.96]  As an explanation
[2601.96 --> 2603.60]  For why he is healing
[2603.60 --> 2604.72]  The crowds of people
[2604.72 --> 2606.18]  Who are following him
[2606.18 --> 2608.44]  Because think about Jesus
[2608.44 --> 2609.46]  How did Jesus
[2609.46 --> 2611.20]  Treat people?
[2611.70 --> 2611.80]  Right
[2611.80 --> 2613.20]  How did he treat the disciples?
[2613.94 --> 2615.34]  How did he treat the sick?
[2616.24 --> 2618.28]  How did he treat little children
[2618.28 --> 2619.00]  And the foreigner?
[2620.08 --> 2621.54]  He was gentle with them
[2621.54 --> 2622.76]  Right
[2622.76 --> 2623.98]  He was so patient
[2623.98 --> 2626.24]  With his thick-headed disciples
[2626.24 --> 2629.68]  He healed the sick
[2629.68 --> 2632.46]  He welcomed the outcasts
[2632.46 --> 2633.80]  And he ate meals with them
[2633.80 --> 2634.12]  Right
[2634.12 --> 2635.28]  He called the little children
[2635.28 --> 2636.00]  To come to him
[2636.00 --> 2637.82]  He spent time with a foreigner
[2637.82 --> 2639.62]  Like a bruised reed
[2639.62 --> 2640.58]  He will not break
[2640.58 --> 2641.52]  In a smoldering wick
[2641.52 --> 2642.74]  He will not snuff out
[2642.74 --> 2644.28]  You know
[2644.28 --> 2644.86]  Just imagine
[2644.86 --> 2645.58]  At your house
[2645.58 --> 2645.84]  You know
[2645.84 --> 2646.42]  You might have
[2646.42 --> 2647.66]  A bouquet of flowers
[2647.66 --> 2648.32]  On your table
[2648.32 --> 2649.82]  And what happens
[2649.82 --> 2650.38]  When some of them
[2650.38 --> 2651.04]  Start to wilt
[2651.04 --> 2651.62]  Right
[2651.62 --> 2652.14]  What happens
[2652.14 --> 2652.74]  When some of them
[2652.74 --> 2653.56]  Start to bend over
[2653.56 --> 2653.98]  And die
[2653.98 --> 2654.58]  What do you do?
[2655.36 --> 2656.40]  You pull them out
[2656.40 --> 2656.64]  Right
[2656.64 --> 2657.88]  You just kind of
[2657.88 --> 2658.66]  Yank them right out
[2658.66 --> 2659.12]  You pull
[2659.12 --> 2659.40]  You know
[2659.40 --> 2660.56]  The ones that are bruised
[2660.56 --> 2661.60]  You get rid of
[2661.60 --> 2664.14]  But with Jesus' rule
[2664.14 --> 2665.88]  You have a bruised reed
[2665.88 --> 2666.80]  A bent stalk
[2666.80 --> 2668.56]  But he won't break it
[2668.56 --> 2670.32]  You know
[2670.32 --> 2671.64]  When we have a candle
[2671.64 --> 2672.82]  That's kind of smoldering
[2672.82 --> 2674.70]  The wick is kind of used up
[2674.70 --> 2675.84]  What do we do?
[2676.82 --> 2677.66]  We throw it out
[2677.66 --> 2678.46]  It's spent
[2678.46 --> 2679.14]  It's used
[2679.14 --> 2681.02]  But Jesus won't
[2681.02 --> 2682.10]  Throw out the candle
[2682.10 --> 2683.08]  Right
[2683.08 --> 2683.80]  This flickering
[2683.80 --> 2684.64]  This tiny wick
[2684.64 --> 2685.78]  He cultivates it
[2685.78 --> 2687.52]  He restores it
[2687.52 --> 2688.98]  He strengthens it
[2688.98 --> 2691.10]  And this friends
[2691.10 --> 2692.42]  Is what is most impressive
[2692.42 --> 2694.64]  About Christ's power
[2694.64 --> 2696.06]  It's his gentleness
[2696.06 --> 2699.10]  Jesus uses his strength
[2699.10 --> 2700.88]  To lift up the lowly
[2700.88 --> 2703.48]  You know
[2703.48 --> 2704.12]  Every year
[2704.12 --> 2705.04]  When Christmas
[2705.04 --> 2706.18]  Starts to approach
[2706.18 --> 2707.72]  I begin to listen
[2707.72 --> 2709.16]  To this one piano album
[2709.16 --> 2711.18]  It's a pianist
[2711.18 --> 2712.58]  Named George Winston
[2712.58 --> 2713.52]  Does anybody know
[2713.52 --> 2714.20]  George Winston?
[2716.02 --> 2716.18]  One
[2716.18 --> 2716.62]  Yes
[2716.62 --> 2716.88]  Okay
[2716.88 --> 2717.88]  We'll talk after
[2717.88 --> 2718.92]  Well
[2718.92 --> 2719.94]  So it's this album
[2719.94 --> 2721.26]  That my mom would always play
[2721.26 --> 2721.72]  In the house
[2721.72 --> 2722.56]  When I was growing up
[2722.56 --> 2723.42]  Around Christmas time
[2723.42 --> 2725.62]  And one of the most amazing things
[2725.62 --> 2727.24]  About his piano playing
[2727.24 --> 2729.68]  Is not just the strength
[2729.68 --> 2730.54]  Of his hands
[2730.54 --> 2732.30]  To play so many chords
[2732.30 --> 2732.94]  And notes
[2732.94 --> 2734.66]  At the same time
[2734.66 --> 2735.94]  But his ability
[2735.94 --> 2737.28]  To play some notes
[2737.28 --> 2738.48]  So quietly
[2738.48 --> 2739.70]  And gently
[2739.70 --> 2742.54]  It takes a lot of strength
[2742.54 --> 2744.04]  To play the piano
[2744.04 --> 2745.24]  Quietly
[2745.24 --> 2747.10]  Far more strength
[2747.10 --> 2747.68]  Than just to be able
[2747.68 --> 2749.36]  To hammer out the chords
[2749.36 --> 2751.08]  Loudly
[2751.08 --> 2751.64]  Right
[2751.64 --> 2754.12]  And so another place
[2754.12 --> 2754.88]  Where we see
[2754.88 --> 2756.28]  This strength in Jesus
[2756.28 --> 2758.66]  Is in Isaiah chapter 40
[2758.66 --> 2761.12]  Isaiah talks about Christ
[2761.12 --> 2762.74]  Coming to rule his people
[2762.74 --> 2764.28]  With power and strength
[2764.28 --> 2765.94]  The power and strength of God
[2765.94 --> 2768.20]  And in chapter 40 verse 10
[2768.20 --> 2769.34]  He says
[2769.34 --> 2771.44]  See the sovereign Lord
[2771.44 --> 2773.44]  Comes with power
[2773.44 --> 2776.00]  And he rules with a mighty arm
[2776.00 --> 2778.74]  But in his strength
[2778.74 --> 2780.66]  That he actually comes with gentleness
[2780.66 --> 2782.26]  Because the next verse
[2782.26 --> 2783.74]  Verse 11 says
[2783.74 --> 2786.00]  He tends his flock
[2786.00 --> 2786.80]  Like a shepherd
[2786.80 --> 2788.90]  He gathers the lambs
[2788.90 --> 2789.66]  In his arms
[2789.66 --> 2790.88]  He carries them
[2790.88 --> 2791.94]  Close to his heart
[2791.94 --> 2793.36]  He gently leads
[2793.36 --> 2794.32]  Those that have young
[2794.32 --> 2797.18]  And so he rules
[2797.18 --> 2798.24]  With this mighty arm
[2798.24 --> 2799.82]  But it's a mighty arm
[2799.82 --> 2800.56]  That is good
[2800.56 --> 2801.92]  At cradling things
[2801.92 --> 2803.24]  Right
[2803.24 --> 2803.90]  His power
[2803.90 --> 2804.64]  And his might
[2804.64 --> 2805.16]  Is good
[2805.16 --> 2806.82]  For gathering lambs
[2806.82 --> 2808.46]  And carrying them
[2808.46 --> 2809.20]  In his bosom
[2809.20 --> 2811.22]  You know
[2811.22 --> 2811.74]  I often
[2811.74 --> 2812.78]  Am reminded here
[2812.78 --> 2813.88]  Like of what C.S. Lewis
[2813.88 --> 2815.16]  Says
[2815.16 --> 2815.96]  In his description
[2815.96 --> 2816.68]  Of the lion
[2816.68 --> 2817.26]  Aslan
[2817.26 --> 2819.60]  Remember what he says
[2819.60 --> 2820.32]  The kids ask
[2820.32 --> 2821.16]  Is he safe
[2821.16 --> 2822.08]  Right
[2822.08 --> 2822.60]  They're nervous
[2822.60 --> 2823.56]  About meeting a lion
[2823.56 --> 2825.96]  And Mr. Beaver says
[2825.96 --> 2827.08]  Safe
[2827.08 --> 2828.68]  Who said anything
[2828.68 --> 2829.48]  About safe
[2829.48 --> 2831.66]  Of course he isn't safe
[2831.66 --> 2833.28]  But he is good
[2833.28 --> 2835.74]  And so when we say
[2835.74 --> 2836.88]  Lord Jesus
[2836.88 --> 2839.04]  Are we aware of that
[2839.04 --> 2840.48]  That he is
[2840.48 --> 2841.50]  The lion of Judah
[2841.50 --> 2843.24]  He is not safe
[2843.24 --> 2844.84]  He is strong
[2844.84 --> 2845.36]  And mighty
[2845.36 --> 2846.10]  And powerful
[2846.10 --> 2848.10]  But he is good
[2848.10 --> 2849.68]  And he uses
[2849.68 --> 2850.70]  His strength
[2850.70 --> 2852.00]  On our behalf
[2852.00 --> 2852.92]  He uses his strength
[2852.92 --> 2853.94]  To lift up the lowly
[2853.94 --> 2856.88]  And it's this vision
[2856.88 --> 2857.48]  Of Jesus
[2857.48 --> 2859.12]  This vision
[2859.12 --> 2860.02]  Of his rule
[2860.02 --> 2860.68]  His power
[2860.68 --> 2861.46]  His strength
[2861.46 --> 2863.22]  That invites us
[2863.22 --> 2864.26]  To trust in him
[2864.26 --> 2865.30]  Right
[2865.30 --> 2866.22]  And to call
[2866.22 --> 2866.80]  To him
[2866.80 --> 2867.22]  To say
[2867.22 --> 2869.32]  Oh Lord
[2869.32 --> 2871.42]  And ask him
[2871.42 --> 2872.16]  To come
[2872.16 --> 2873.48]  Oh Lord
[2873.48 --> 2874.18]  Come
[2874.18 --> 2876.00]  And rescue me
[2876.00 --> 2877.00]  Come and help me
[2877.00 --> 2878.16]  Come and save me
[2878.16 --> 2879.46]  Be my strength
[2879.46 --> 2881.80]  Because I am
[2881.80 --> 2882.70]  That bruised reed
[2882.70 --> 2883.90]  Right
[2883.90 --> 2884.94]  I can be so easily
[2884.94 --> 2885.74]  Broken off
[2885.74 --> 2886.96]  And I am like
[2886.96 --> 2887.76]  That burning wick
[2887.76 --> 2888.60]  That can so easily
[2888.60 --> 2889.82]  Be snuffed out
[2889.82 --> 2891.62]  I am like
[2891.62 --> 2892.10]  That sheep
[2892.10 --> 2893.28]  That goes astray
[2893.28 --> 2895.14]  And I get myself
[2895.14 --> 2895.64]  Into trouble
[2895.64 --> 2896.62]  And I need to be
[2896.62 --> 2897.86]  Carried
[2897.86 --> 2900.58]  And so we can cry out
[2900.58 --> 2901.56]  Oh Lord
[2901.56 --> 2902.58]  Come
[2902.58 --> 2904.20]  Be my strength
[2904.20 --> 2905.74]  Do what I cannot do
[2905.74 --> 2907.12]  Not only be my wisdom
[2907.12 --> 2908.58]  But help me to
[2908.58 --> 2909.72]  Carry it out
[2909.72 --> 2910.44]  And live
[2910.44 --> 2911.62]  In your ways
[2911.62 --> 2914.02]  In the ways of the Lord
[2914.02 --> 2916.40]  And you know
[2916.40 --> 2917.24]  Christ's power
[2917.24 --> 2919.46]  And his gentleness
[2919.46 --> 2920.72]  Is evident
[2920.72 --> 2921.70]  Every Christmas
[2921.70 --> 2923.22]  As we consider
[2923.22 --> 2923.98]  The presence
[2923.98 --> 2925.26]  Of the almighty
[2925.26 --> 2926.00]  God
[2926.00 --> 2928.48]  Come as a tiny baby
[2928.48 --> 2931.12]  And then this baby
[2931.12 --> 2932.10]  Will grow up
[2932.10 --> 2933.50]  To powerfully
[2933.50 --> 2934.86]  Rescue us
[2934.86 --> 2935.86]  His people
[2935.86 --> 2937.38]  Through his death
[2937.38 --> 2938.30]  On the cross
[2938.30 --> 2939.40]  By which he conquered
[2939.40 --> 2940.80]  Sin, death, and the devil
[2940.80 --> 2943.18]  And through his resurrection
[2943.18 --> 2944.98]  From the dead
[2944.98 --> 2945.98]  His victory
[2945.98 --> 2949.82]  Now there's just one more
[2949.82 --> 2951.66]  Thing I think we see here
[2951.66 --> 2952.42]  In this passage
[2952.42 --> 2953.48]  There's one more thing
[2953.48 --> 2956.08]  About Jesus' rule
[2956.08 --> 2957.62]  And that it is
[2957.62 --> 2959.16]  It's that it brings
[2959.16 --> 2959.88]  Restoration
[2959.88 --> 2960.56]  Okay
[2960.56 --> 2961.74]  His rule brings
[2961.74 --> 2962.92]  Restoration
[2962.92 --> 2963.80]  Okay
[2963.80 --> 2964.72]  So he's empowered
[2964.72 --> 2965.68]  By the Holy Spirit
[2965.68 --> 2967.64]  He judges fairly
[2967.64 --> 2968.64]  He's gentle
[2968.64 --> 2969.38]  With the humble
[2969.38 --> 2970.58]  And then in verses
[2970.58 --> 2971.30]  Six to nine
[2971.30 --> 2971.86]  In our passage
[2971.86 --> 2973.24]  It shows us
[2973.24 --> 2974.14]  That Jesus' power
[2974.14 --> 2974.54]  And rule
[2974.54 --> 2975.46]  Is always
[2975.46 --> 2977.30]  Aimed towards
[2977.30 --> 2978.20]  Restoration
[2978.20 --> 2979.54]  And redemption
[2979.54 --> 2981.70]  So let's look
[2981.70 --> 2982.66]  At verse six
[2982.66 --> 2984.30]  It says
[2984.30 --> 2985.12]  The wolf
[2985.12 --> 2985.78]  Will live
[2985.78 --> 2986.52]  With the lamb
[2986.52 --> 2987.12]  And the leopard
[2987.12 --> 2987.86]  Will lie down
[2987.86 --> 2988.46]  With the goat
[2988.46 --> 2989.88]  The calf
[2989.88 --> 2990.56]  And the lion
[2990.56 --> 2991.26]  And the yearling
[2991.26 --> 2991.70]  Together
[2991.70 --> 2993.32]  And a little child
[2993.32 --> 2993.96]  Will lead them
[2993.96 --> 2995.42]  It's such an
[2995.42 --> 2996.20]  Interesting image
[2996.20 --> 2996.44]  Right
[2996.44 --> 2997.30]  If you picture that
[2997.30 --> 2999.80]  And the language
[2999.80 --> 3000.84]  That Isaiah uses
[3000.84 --> 3001.66]  Here is striking
[3001.66 --> 3001.98]  Right
[3001.98 --> 3003.58]  It's full of
[3003.58 --> 3004.60]  These pairings
[3004.60 --> 3005.54]  It's full of
[3005.54 --> 3006.32]  These scenarios
[3006.32 --> 3008.16]  That would be
[3008.16 --> 3009.64]  Disasters
[3009.64 --> 3011.52]  In the world
[3011.52 --> 3012.32]  As we know it
[3012.32 --> 3013.70]  Right
[3013.70 --> 3014.60]  Wolves do not
[3014.60 --> 3015.68]  Lie with lambs
[3015.68 --> 3017.30]  They devour them
[3017.30 --> 3019.32]  Same for
[3019.32 --> 3020.68]  Leopards and goats
[3020.68 --> 3022.74]  Calves and lions
[3022.74 --> 3024.42]  And you certainly
[3024.42 --> 3025.16]  Would not want
[3025.16 --> 3025.98]  A little child
[3025.98 --> 3027.24]  Leading this parade
[3027.24 --> 3029.58]  And then verse eight
[3029.58 --> 3030.20]  It envisions
[3030.20 --> 3031.70]  This nightmare scenario
[3031.70 --> 3033.82]  The infant will play
[3033.82 --> 3034.98]  Near the cobra's den
[3034.98 --> 3036.12]  The young child
[3036.12 --> 3037.22]  Will put its hand
[3037.22 --> 3039.58]  Into the viper's nest
[3039.58 --> 3041.12]  Reminds me of a time
[3041.12 --> 3041.98]  When my daughter
[3041.98 --> 3043.16]  Caught a copperhead
[3043.16 --> 3045.76]  In a little box
[3045.76 --> 3046.64]  Luckily it was
[3046.64 --> 3047.72]  A baby copperhead
[3047.72 --> 3048.30]  But it was like
[3048.30 --> 3048.90]  You know
[3048.90 --> 3049.52]  It was like striking
[3049.52 --> 3050.36]  And she's like
[3050.36 --> 3051.06]  Look what I have
[3051.06 --> 3051.66]  Like ah
[3051.66 --> 3052.96]  Right
[3052.96 --> 3057.08]  An infant
[3057.08 --> 3057.70]  You know
[3057.70 --> 3058.42]  Is a child
[3058.42 --> 3059.54]  Who is still nursing
[3059.54 --> 3061.00]  It's a very young baby
[3061.00 --> 3062.70]  Playing with a cobra
[3062.70 --> 3064.18]  In a cobra's den
[3064.18 --> 3066.06]  A young child
[3066.06 --> 3067.64]  Is this preschooler
[3067.64 --> 3068.86]  Or kindergarten age
[3068.86 --> 3069.86]  Putting their hand
[3069.86 --> 3071.08]  Into a viper's nest
[3071.08 --> 3080.58]  And for Isaiah's readers
[3080.58 --> 3083.46]  They knew what comes next
[3083.46 --> 3084.18]  In that story
[3084.18 --> 3085.42]  Right
[3085.42 --> 3086.66]  In a world that's fallen
[3086.66 --> 3088.20]  Because of the curse of sin
[3088.20 --> 3090.10]  These stories would end
[3090.10 --> 3091.16]  In tragedy
[3091.16 --> 3092.62]  And in heartbreak
[3092.62 --> 3095.36]  But under the rule of Christ
[3095.36 --> 3097.46]  These aren't nightmares
[3097.46 --> 3098.94]  They are actually
[3098.94 --> 3099.78]  The restoration
[3099.78 --> 3101.52]  That his rule brings
[3101.52 --> 3102.66]  Right
[3102.66 --> 3103.64]  That the fearsome
[3103.64 --> 3104.86]  Wolf and leopard
[3104.86 --> 3106.14]  And lion and bear
[3106.14 --> 3107.92]  They are tamed and gentle
[3107.92 --> 3109.50]  You don't have to
[3109.50 --> 3110.82]  Defend yourselves against them
[3110.82 --> 3112.06]  They can be trusted
[3112.06 --> 3114.12]  To sleep and eat
[3114.12 --> 3115.22]  With the most vulnerable
[3115.22 --> 3116.06]  You know
[3116.06 --> 3116.58]  Animals
[3116.58 --> 3118.48]  Even at night
[3118.48 --> 3120.54]  They can rest
[3120.54 --> 3121.54]  Soundly
[3121.54 --> 3122.80]  You know
[3122.80 --> 3123.48]  And I would enjoy
[3123.48 --> 3124.94]  Backpacking up in Garibaldi
[3124.94 --> 3126.18]  If I knew
[3126.18 --> 3126.70]  That a bear
[3126.70 --> 3127.44]  Wasn't going to try
[3127.44 --> 3128.16]  To get in my tent
[3128.16 --> 3129.52]  In the middle of the night
[3129.52 --> 3132.48]  In the story
[3132.48 --> 3132.98]  Of the children
[3132.98 --> 3133.66]  With the snakes
[3133.66 --> 3133.86]  You know
[3133.86 --> 3135.12]  It doesn't end in tragedy
[3135.12 --> 3136.84]  It doesn't end at all
[3136.84 --> 3138.82]  The child continues
[3138.82 --> 3139.52]  To sit there
[3139.52 --> 3140.36]  And play happily
[3140.36 --> 3142.24]  Right
[3142.24 --> 3143.02]  And this is the way
[3143.02 --> 3143.90]  The world should be
[3143.90 --> 3144.74]  It's this picture
[3144.74 --> 3145.94]  Of
[3145.94 --> 3148.58]  What peace looks like
[3148.58 --> 3150.40]  Sometimes theologians
[3150.40 --> 3151.04]  Will call this
[3151.04 --> 3152.28]  The peaceable kingdom
[3152.28 --> 3153.54]  Of Christ
[3153.54 --> 3155.16]  This is what it looks like
[3155.16 --> 3155.74]  When the world
[3155.74 --> 3157.54]  No longer fights against us
[3157.54 --> 3159.44]  But all of God's creatures
[3159.44 --> 3160.94]  In his world
[3160.94 --> 3161.54]  Live
[3161.54 --> 3162.48]  In peace
[3162.48 --> 3163.32]  Under his rule
[3163.32 --> 3165.62]  Isaiah is actually
[3165.62 --> 3166.60]  Picturing here
[3166.60 --> 3168.28]  The complete reversal
[3168.28 --> 3169.92]  Of the curse
[3169.92 --> 3170.82]  From Genesis 3
[3170.82 --> 3171.98]  Right
[3171.98 --> 3172.72]  When Adam and Eve
[3172.72 --> 3173.84]  Rebelled against God
[3173.84 --> 3174.76]  And God's rule
[3174.76 --> 3175.24]  In the garden
[3175.24 --> 3176.80]  Not only were they
[3176.80 --> 3178.30]  Exiled from God's presence
[3178.30 --> 3179.78]  But the whole world
[3179.78 --> 3180.70]  Came under a curse
[3180.70 --> 3182.10]  And that's why
[3182.10 --> 3183.02]  You can't trust
[3183.02 --> 3184.56]  A wolf
[3184.56 --> 3185.38]  To lie down
[3185.38 --> 3185.98]  With a lamb
[3185.98 --> 3187.38]  Right
[3187.38 --> 3188.52]  The world was subjected
[3188.52 --> 3189.32]  To conflict
[3189.32 --> 3190.16]  And futility
[3190.16 --> 3192.26]  But when Jesus
[3192.26 --> 3193.50]  Comes to rule
[3193.50 --> 3194.80]  It undoes
[3194.80 --> 3195.60]  The effects
[3195.60 --> 3196.54]  Of the curse
[3196.54 --> 3197.18]  Of the fall
[3197.18 --> 3198.42]  It restores
[3198.42 --> 3199.42]  Creation
[3199.42 --> 3201.20]  To where it has
[3201.20 --> 3201.86]  Always
[3201.86 --> 3203.88]  Always should have been
[3203.88 --> 3204.30]  Right
[3204.30 --> 3205.50]  Beautifully at peace
[3205.50 --> 3208.72]  And because as verse 9 says
[3208.72 --> 3211.22]  They will neither harm
[3211.22 --> 3211.92]  Nor destroy
[3211.92 --> 3213.48]  On all my holy mountain
[3213.48 --> 3214.94]  Right
[3214.94 --> 3216.20]  No longer will nature
[3216.20 --> 3218.10]  Be red in tooth
[3218.10 --> 3218.74]  And claw
[3218.74 --> 3220.88]  It will be creation
[3220.88 --> 3222.44]  Restored to shalom
[3222.44 --> 3224.26]  And then the end
[3224.26 --> 3224.98]  Of verse 9
[3224.98 --> 3226.44]  Is just as significant
[3226.44 --> 3228.04]  Because it reveals
[3228.04 --> 3228.92]  Not only the restoration
[3228.92 --> 3229.58]  Of the world
[3229.58 --> 3230.32]  But the restoration
[3230.32 --> 3231.38]  Of us
[3231.38 --> 3233.42]  For the earth
[3233.42 --> 3234.10]  Will be filled
[3234.10 --> 3234.84]  With the knowledge
[3234.84 --> 3235.68]  Of the Lord
[3235.68 --> 3238.66]  As the waters
[3238.66 --> 3239.98]  Cover the sea
[3239.98 --> 3241.28]  Right
[3241.28 --> 3241.62]  Jesus
[3241.62 --> 3242.24]  Jesus
[3242.24 --> 3242.92]  His rule
[3242.92 --> 3244.28]  It restores peace
[3244.28 --> 3245.12]  To this whole world
[3245.12 --> 3247.66]  And it restores knowledge
[3247.66 --> 3249.08]  And righteousness
[3249.08 --> 3250.00]  And holiness
[3250.00 --> 3251.20]  To us
[3251.20 --> 3252.66]  And one day
[3252.66 --> 3253.24]  The whole world
[3253.24 --> 3253.90]  Will be filled
[3253.90 --> 3255.18]  With a glorious reign
[3255.18 --> 3255.76]  Of Christ
[3255.76 --> 3260.16]  So
[3260.16 --> 3261.84]  Jesus has come
[3261.84 --> 3262.26]  Hasn't he
[3262.26 --> 3263.74]  He has come
[3263.74 --> 3264.46]  Already
[3264.46 --> 3266.98]  He has inaugurated
[3266.98 --> 3267.70]  His kingdom
[3267.70 --> 3269.46]  But in advent
[3269.46 --> 3270.52]  We are reminded
[3270.52 --> 3271.68]  Also that he will
[3271.68 --> 3272.24]  Come again
[3272.24 --> 3274.14]  He will come again
[3274.14 --> 3276.06]  To finish his work
[3276.06 --> 3277.04]  And he will come again
[3277.04 --> 3278.02]  To finally rule
[3278.02 --> 3279.10]  Over all things
[3279.10 --> 3280.96]  Thanks be to God
[3280.96 --> 3281.94]  Okay
[3281.94 --> 3282.68]  Let's pray together
[3282.68 --> 3287.44]  Lord we praise you again
[3287.44 --> 3288.66]  For what you have done
[3288.66 --> 3290.52]  For the works
[3290.52 --> 3291.40]  Of your hands
[3291.40 --> 3293.14]  For the way
[3293.14 --> 3295.56]  That we have found you
[3295.56 --> 3297.48]  In our own lives
[3297.48 --> 3298.12]  To be both
[3298.12 --> 3299.30]  Strong
[3299.30 --> 3300.32]  And gentle
[3300.32 --> 3301.84]  Slow to anger
[3301.84 --> 3303.20]  Abounding in steadfast
[3303.20 --> 3304.28]  Love and faithfulness
[3304.28 --> 3307.08]  And Lord we praise you
[3307.08 --> 3307.96]  For the rule
[3307.96 --> 3308.98]  Of our savior
[3308.98 --> 3310.10]  That he rules
[3310.10 --> 3311.16]  With both righteousness
[3311.16 --> 3312.08]  And justice
[3312.08 --> 3313.18]  He does not judge
[3313.18 --> 3314.32]  Based merely
[3314.32 --> 3315.44]  On what he sees
[3315.44 --> 3316.78]  But he judges
[3316.78 --> 3317.80]  Based on the truth
[3317.80 --> 3319.60]  And we praise you
[3319.60 --> 3320.78]  That he lifts
[3320.78 --> 3321.70]  High the lowly
[3321.70 --> 3323.52]  And the humble
[3323.52 --> 3324.16]  And the poor
[3324.16 --> 3327.16]  And Lord we pray
[3327.16 --> 3327.78]  For the fullness
[3327.78 --> 3328.58]  Of his rule
[3328.58 --> 3329.42]  The fullness
[3329.42 --> 3330.58]  Of his wise
[3330.58 --> 3332.78]  Spirit empowered rule
[3332.78 --> 3334.46]  When the creation
[3334.46 --> 3335.86]  Itself will be remade
[3335.86 --> 3336.68]  And our hearts
[3336.68 --> 3337.90]  Will be full
[3337.90 --> 3338.74]  Of the knowledge
[3338.74 --> 3339.46]  Of the Lord
[3339.46 --> 3340.78]  And Father
[3340.78 --> 3341.74]  As that day
[3341.74 --> 3342.52]  Tarries
[3342.52 --> 3343.94]  We pray
[3343.94 --> 3346.10]  That while we wait
[3346.10 --> 3346.52]  That you would
[3346.52 --> 3347.62]  Continue to change us
[3347.62 --> 3348.74]  Into Jesus' image
[3348.74 --> 3350.00]  That you would
[3350.00 --> 3350.88]  Give us the same
[3350.88 --> 3351.52]  Holy Spirit
[3351.52 --> 3352.10]  Of wisdom
[3352.10 --> 3352.72]  And knowledge
[3352.72 --> 3353.62]  And understanding
[3353.62 --> 3355.12]  And grant us
[3355.12 --> 3356.18]  The fear of the Lord
[3356.18 --> 3357.56]  Make that our delight
[3357.56 --> 3358.74]  Even as it was
[3358.74 --> 3359.88]  The delight
[3359.88 --> 3361.02]  Of Jesus our Lord
[3361.02 --> 3362.84]  We pray these things
[3362.84 --> 3363.60]  In Jesus' name
[3363.60 --> 3364.26]  Amen
[3364.26 --> 3368.32]  Let's stand
[3368.32 --> 3369.32]  And we will
[3369.32 --> 3370.72]  Sing our
[3370.72 --> 3371.84]  Song
[3371.84 --> 3372.76]  That we will be singing
[3372.76 --> 3373.44]  Each week
[3373.44 --> 3374.54]  In the season of Advent
[3374.54 --> 3376.42]  O come O come
[3376.42 --> 3377.02]  Emmanuel
[3377.02 --> 3378.26]  And I think
[3378.26 --> 3378.78]  Marion will have
[3378.78 --> 3379.32]  Some instructions
[3379.32 --> 3380.66]  For us again
[3380.66 --> 3383.22]  Yes we will
[3383.22 --> 3384.40]  Follow the same
[3384.40 --> 3385.40]  Sequence we did
[3385.40 --> 3386.00]  Last week
[3386.00 --> 3386.72]  I will play it
[3386.72 --> 3387.30]  Quietly
[3387.30 --> 3387.94]  You can use
[3387.94 --> 3388.60]  That time
[3388.60 --> 3389.14]  As a
[3389.14 --> 3391.54]  Time of reflection
[3391.54 --> 3392.40]  And then
[3392.40 --> 3393.32]  Hum it once
[3393.32 --> 3394.26]  And then we will
[3394.26 --> 3395.34]  Sing the two verses
[3395.34 --> 3396.06]  That we have
[3396.06 --> 3396.82]  This week
[3410.66 --> 3412.56]  poem
[3412.56 --> 3437.18]  On le
[3437.18 --> 3438.04]  and
[3438.04 --> 3439.04]  Amen.
[3468.04 --> 3469.04]  Amen.
[3498.04 --> 3500.04]  Amen.
[3528.04 --> 3529.04]  Amen.
[3558.04 --> 3560.04]  Amen.
[3588.04 --> 3589.04]  Amen.
[3618.04 --> 3634.86]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[3648.04 --> 3661.56]  Our offering for today is for denominational shares.
[3661.56 --> 3668.76]  Denominational ministry shares support mission and ministry both here at home and around
[3668.76 --> 3670.72]  the world.
[3670.72 --> 3680.60]  They support congregational and Canadian ministries, Reframe, Kelvin Theological Seminary, and
[3680.60 --> 3683.94]  Resonate Global Missions.
[3683.94 --> 3685.80]  The deacons may come forward at this time.
[3700.72 --> 3701.72]  Amen.
[3701.72 --> 3703.06]  Amen.
[3703.06 --> 3704.06]  Amen.
[3704.06 --> 3705.22]  Amen.
[3705.22 --> 3706.06]  Amen.
[3706.06 --> 3706.88]  Amen.
[3706.88 --> 3708.26]  Amen.
[3708.26 --> 3709.44]  Amen.
[3709.44 --> 3710.38]  Amen.
[3710.38 --> 3710.72]  Amen.
[3710.72 --> 3712.34]  Amen.
[3712.34 --> 3713.82]  Amen.
[3713.82 --> 3715.96]  Amen.
[3715.96 --> 3717.62]  Amen.
[3717.62 --> 3719.84]  Amen.
[3719.84 --> 3720.16]  Amen.
[3720.16 --> 3721.26]  Amen.
[3721.26 --> 3722.40]  Amen.
[3722.40 --> 3722.94]  Amen.
[3722.94 --> 3724.48]  Amen.
[3724.48 --> 3725.48]  Amen.
[3725.48 --> 3726.04]  Amen.
[3726.04 --> 3727.28]  Amen.
[3727.28 --> 3729.54]  Amen.
[3729.54 --> 3730.06]  Amen.
[3730.06 --> 3730.32]  Amen.
[3730.32 --> 3731.32]  Amen.
[3760.32 --> 3761.32]  Amen.
[3790.32 --> 3791.32]  Amen.
[3820.32 --> 3821.32]  Amen.
[3821.32 --> 3822.32]  Amen.
[3822.32 --> 3829.50]  So one of the amazing privileges that we have is to come before God in prayer and ask him
[3829.50 --> 3830.70]  for all we need.
[3830.70 --> 3834.32]  Ask him also for the needs of the world.
[3834.32 --> 3840.84]  And you know, as Elaine mentioned, our sister, mother in the faith, Allie Hacklander, passed
[3840.84 --> 3842.00]  away into glory this morning.
[3842.00 --> 3848.26]  And so of course we will be praying for her family and for other things.
[3848.26 --> 3852.00]  And so you can join me in your hearts and minds as we pray.
[3852.00 --> 3856.02]  Then throughout the prayer, I will say, we pray.
[3856.02 --> 3859.84]  And you can respond with, come Lord Jesus.
[3859.84 --> 3863.22]  And then we will also end, conclude with the Lord's Prayer.
[3863.22 --> 3870.62]  So let's go before our great King and Lord of might and let's pray together.
[3870.62 --> 3877.14]  Our gracious and faithful God, thank you for being our Father.
[3877.14 --> 3886.90]  Our creator, our redeemer, our strength, our guide, our comforter, our healer.
[3886.90 --> 3889.56]  Emmanuel, God with us.
[3889.56 --> 3891.38]  Light of the world.
[3891.38 --> 3893.98]  The giver of life.
[3893.98 --> 3896.82]  We know this is who you are, Lord.
[3896.82 --> 3903.88]  And yet we are so often overwhelmed by the darkness and by the brokenness of this world.
[3903.88 --> 3906.62]  And Lord, we are desperate for you.
[3906.62 --> 3910.64]  And Lord, you are our great physician.
[3910.64 --> 3916.64]  And so we ask for your healing power and presence for those who are suffering with illness.
[3916.64 --> 3926.40]  Lord, there are many in our congregation and those also we know in our families who need your continual healing in their lives.
[3926.40 --> 3927.40]  Lord, we pray for Tani.
[3927.40 --> 3929.40]  We pray for Amy.
[3929.40 --> 3932.64]  And Lord, for many others in our hearts.
[3932.64 --> 3937.64]  We pray, come Lord Jesus.
[3937.64 --> 3944.24]  Prince of peace, we ask for your comfort for those who are grieving because of death.
[3944.24 --> 3950.88]  Lord, we thank you for the long life and the long health of Allie.
[3950.88 --> 3963.48]  Lord, we thank you for the long life and the long life of all of us.
[3963.48 --> 3964.48]  And Lord, we thank you for the long life and the long life of all of us.
[3964.48 --> 3972.22]  And that even despite her sin, that through Jesus Christ, that she was a daughter of God.
[3972.22 --> 3978.36]  Lord, we praise you, Lord, for her hope, her hope that was in you.
[3978.36 --> 3982.22]  And Lord, that even now she is in, that she is in glory.
[3982.22 --> 3985.58]  Lord, that she is freed from all sin and suffering.
[3985.58 --> 3991.22]  And that she is more alive now than she ever has been in your eternal presence.
[3992.02 --> 3995.36]  We pray, come Lord Jesus.
[3995.36 --> 3997.36]  Lord, we pray, come Lord Jesus.
[3997.36 --> 4004.30]  Oh, wisdom, your words uttered in the beginning created a world of beauty and goodness, giving
[4004.30 --> 4010.12]  purpose and value to each creature that you made.
[4010.12 --> 4016.36]  Instruct us in the way of prudence that we might nurture the world with justice and with
[4016.36 --> 4018.50]  joy.
[4018.50 --> 4024.72]  Help us to resist evil and to obey you so that we may walk in your ways to the glory of your
[4024.72 --> 4025.72]  your name.
[4025.72 --> 4036.00]  And we ask for your wisdom for those of us facing challenging decisions, needing direction,
[4036.00 --> 4043.72]  having questions with relationships or parenting or taking care of an older parent.
[4043.72 --> 4046.46]  Lord, give us your wisdom.
[4046.46 --> 4049.96]  We pray, come Lord Jesus.
[4049.96 --> 4057.12]  O Lord of might and ruler of the house of Israel, you have rescued your people from the midst
[4057.12 --> 4061.52]  of slavery, exile, war, and evil.
[4061.52 --> 4067.96]  Raise your scepter over us that your saving rule may extend to all people and all places.
[4067.96 --> 4076.56]  Lord, we pray for those in our families, our workplaces, our friends and acquaintances who
[4076.56 --> 4079.24]  do not yet know you as Lord.
[4079.24 --> 4085.42]  Would you, O Lord, shed the light of the knowledge of the glory of Christ into their hearts that
[4085.42 --> 4087.40]  they might turn to you in faith?
[4087.40 --> 4091.12]  We pray, come Lord Jesus.
[4091.12 --> 4099.16]  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications
[4099.16 --> 4101.00]  to you.
[4101.00 --> 4105.26]  And you have promised through your beloved son that when two or three are gathered together
[4105.26 --> 4109.66]  in his name, you will grant their requests.
[4109.66 --> 4117.36]  Fill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions, as may be best for us, granting us in this world
[4117.36 --> 4124.04]  knowledge of your truth and in the age to come life everlasting.
[4124.04 --> 4132.04]  We pray in the name of Christ our Lord who taught us to pray, saying together, our Father
[4132.04 --> 4135.54]  in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4135.54 --> 4141.58]  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4141.58 --> 4148.92]  Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[4148.92 --> 4154.34]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[4154.34 --> 4160.60]  For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory now and forever.
[4160.60 --> 4161.60]  Amen.
[4162.04 --> 4168.60]  Please stand, and we will go out with God's blessing upon us.
[4168.60 --> 4170.60]  Again, a couple of things.
[4170.60 --> 4176.82]  If you are able, would you join us for a time of fellowship right through the doors in the
[4176.82 --> 4178.32]  fellowship hall?
[4178.32 --> 4185.48]  Also, don't forget that we have choir rehearsals at about 1130, so come back for that afterwards.
[4185.48 --> 4187.54]  Don't forget to come back.
[4187.54 --> 4193.10]  Another thing is, as you go out to your coffee, some of our deacons will be standing by the
[4193.10 --> 4197.10]  doors with baskets, and they will be collecting our faith promise-giving forms.
[4197.10 --> 4203.66]  If you do not have those with you today, you can put them into the deacons mail slot, please,
[4203.66 --> 4205.66]  by December 8th, I believe it is.
[4205.66 --> 4207.22]  So thank you.
[4207.22 --> 4212.78]  And lastly, we have these lovely Advent reading bookmarks.
[4212.78 --> 4217.78]  And for this season of Advent, the readings kind of walk us through the story of the Bible,
[4217.78 --> 4218.78]  looking at some key passages.
[4218.78 --> 4226.34]  So it's a good time to jump in and read along in the scriptures for this season.
[4226.34 --> 4228.72]  So now, receive the Lord's blessing.
[4228.72 --> 4230.88]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4230.88 --> 4235.24]  The Lord turn his face toward you and be gracious to you.
[4235.24 --> 4263.24]  The Lord shine his face upon you and give you peace.
[4263.24 --> 4265.24]  Alleluia.
[4265.24 --> 4266.24]  Alleluia.
[4266.24 --> 4267.24]  Alleluia.
[4267.24 --> 4270.24]  Alleluia.

[4298.24 --> 4300.24]  Alleluia.
[4300.24 --> 4305.24]  Alleluia.
[4305.24 --> 4306.24]  Alleluia.
[4306.24 --> 4307.24]  Alleluia.
[4307.24 --> 4309.24]  Alleluia.
[4309.24 --> 4310.24]  Alleluia.
[4310.24 --> 4320.24]  Alleluia.
[4320.24 --> 4322.24]  Alleluia.
[4322.24 --> 4323.24]  Alleluia.
[4323.24 --> 4324.24]  Alleluia.
[4324.24 --> 4329.24]  Alleluia.
[4329.24 --> 4330.24]  Alleluia.
[4330.24 --> 4345.92]  Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb, You are holy, holy, are You, Lord God Almighty.
[4348.06 --> 4355.18]  Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb, Amen.
[4360.24 --> 4390.22]  Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb, Amen.
