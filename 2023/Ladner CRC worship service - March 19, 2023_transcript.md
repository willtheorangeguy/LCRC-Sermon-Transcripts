[0.00 --> 1.12]  Godior!
[1.12 --> 5.82]  I met the new priest.
[5.82 --> 7.28]  Amen.
[7.28 --> 10.12]  He was living with cie.
[10.12 --> 11.82]  Thanks a little
[11.82 --> 13.86]  coming in
[13.86 --> 18.64]  with God,
[18.64 --> 20.90]  Holy Spirit of God.
[20.90 --> 26.20]  I have aerede song,
[26.20 --> 29.52]  for the same one you've made his ownック rogue icon.
[29.52 --> 31.52]  Amen.
[59.52 --> 61.52]  Amen.
[89.52 --> 91.52]  Amen.
[119.52 --> 121.52]  Amen.
[149.52 --> 151.52]  Amen.
[179.52 --> 181.52]  Amen.
[209.52 --> 211.52]  Amen.
[239.52 --> 241.52]  Amen.
[269.52 --> 271.52]  Amen.
[299.52 --> 301.52]  Amen.
[319.52 --> 321.02]  Good morning, everyone.
[322.10 --> 325.44]  I want to welcome you this morning to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[325.44 --> 329.94]  and we are very glad that you are with us today, especially if you are new.
[331.08 --> 333.24]  We want to give you a warm welcome.
[334.92 --> 343.44]  So you know, every time we come here this morning, we call what we do here a worship service.
[344.28 --> 348.78]  And the reason we do that is because we get to practice, though imperfectly,
[349.14 --> 355.18]  what we one day will do perfectly and fully, which is to worship Jesus.
[355.44 --> 363.78]  And so our worship service each Sunday is, in a sense, to anticipate what we will all get to do one day.
[364.86 --> 370.60]  And so it's somewhat like a dress rehearsal that we do on an ongoing basis.
[371.10 --> 372.46]  And that's what worship is all about.
[373.68 --> 377.40]  So I want to invite you to hear and to respond to God's call to worship this morning.
[377.82 --> 381.52]  Please join me on the screen in the parts that are indicated in bold.
[381.52 --> 386.82]  And let's hear this call to worship from Revelation 15, Psalm 9.
[387.94 --> 391.88]  Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty.
[392.66 --> 396.08]  Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.
[397.26 --> 402.00]  Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name?
[402.54 --> 404.44]  For you alone are holy.
[404.44 --> 408.32]  All nations will come and worship you.
[409.12 --> 412.54]  We will give thanks to you, Lord, with all our hearts.
[412.72 --> 415.76]  We will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
[416.54 --> 419.30]  We will be glad and rejoice in you.
[420.04 --> 424.58]  We will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.
[425.40 --> 429.02]  So let's now come before the Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[429.48 --> 430.30]  Let's pray together.
[430.30 --> 440.62]  Father, Holy Father, desire of the nations, we draw near to you this morning because you first draw near to us.
[441.76 --> 445.30]  We come as we are because there is no other way to come.
[446.22 --> 455.84]  But we must never think that we would stay as we are because we are meeting with you, the God who comes and transforms us.
[455.84 --> 458.58]  Father, you know every heart here.
[458.74 --> 460.12]  You know every story here.
[460.80 --> 462.68]  You know our deepest longings.
[462.86 --> 465.06]  You know our joys and our pains.
[465.92 --> 470.66]  And so, Father, I pray that this morning that your spirit would minister to each heart here.
[471.68 --> 479.46]  Those of us who are just learning what it means to follow you and those who have called you Father for many, many years.
[479.46 --> 484.76]  Lord, help us to realize and to recognize that you are here.
[484.88 --> 485.74]  You are in our midst.
[486.54 --> 491.80]  And help us to respond in such a way that we might say even this morning that we have met with you.
[493.06 --> 496.10]  Father, would you reveal to us your Son, Jesus Christ,
[496.76 --> 500.14]  who is the love who has come down from heaven's gates,
[500.72 --> 504.94]  whose name is Jesus, the King of glory and the King of the nations.
[505.24 --> 507.36]  We pray in his name.
[507.84 --> 508.18]  Amen.
[508.18 --> 513.02]  So I want to invite you to stand in body or in spirit as you are able
[513.02 --> 517.34]  to hear God's greeting to us this morning from Lamentations 3.
[519.38 --> 522.68]  The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[523.52 --> 525.60]  His mercies never come to an end.
[526.08 --> 527.50]  They are new every morning.
[527.72 --> 529.32]  Great is your faithfulness.
[530.02 --> 532.56]  The Lord is my portion, says my soul.
[533.38 --> 535.00]  Therefore, I will hope in him.
[535.00 --> 538.82]  Would you please turn to those around you?
[538.96 --> 542.16]  And just as the Lord has greeted us, would you greet those around you,
[542.24 --> 544.10]  especially those maybe you've never met before?
[544.10 --> 546.44]  Okay.
[546.74 --> 548.92]  Second hour.
[561.34 --> 561.92]  Third hour.
[562.02 --> 566.86]  First hour.
[567.30 --> 568.30]  First hour.
[568.30 --> 569.12]  First hour.
[569.12 --> 569.42]  First hour.
[569.42 --> 570.24]  First hour.
[570.24 --> 600.22]  Thank you.
[600.24 --> 608.24]  Father in heaven, how we love you.
[608.84 --> 614.62]  We lift your name in all the earth.
[615.48 --> 620.46]  May your kingdom be established in our presence.
[622.34 --> 627.40]  As we before declare your mighty works.
[627.40 --> 633.56]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[635.28 --> 640.36]  Who was and is and is to come.
[640.78 --> 646.46]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[648.24 --> 653.40]  Who reigns forevermore.
[653.40 --> 659.94]  Father of mercy be exalted.
[661.28 --> 666.62]  May Jesus may be lifted high.
[666.62 --> 673.78]  For the sacrifice of love has won our pardon.
[675.54 --> 680.58]  And his resurrection power gives us life.
[681.10 --> 686.92]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[686.92 --> 693.92]  Who was and is and is to come.
[693.92 --> 700.14]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[700.14 --> 707.70]  Who reigns forevermore.
[707.70 --> 713.70]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[713.70 --> 720.58]  Who was and is and is to come.
[720.58 --> 726.92]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[726.92 --> 733.80]  Who reigns forevermore.
[733.80 --> 750.90]  thì złymets fire to mind.
[750.90 --> 763.86]  Wonderful, so wonderful is your unfailing love.
[763.86 --> 770.36]  Your cross has spoken mercy over me.
[771.32 --> 778.62]  No ear has seen, no ear has heard, no heart could fully know
[778.62 --> 785.44]  how glorious, how beautiful you are.
[785.44 --> 793.20]  Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore,
[793.60 --> 799.98]  beautiful one my soul must see.
[799.98 --> 808.80]  Powerful, so powerful, your glory fills the skies.
[808.80 --> 814.80]  Your mighty works displayed for all to see.
[814.80 --> 822.62]  A beauty of your majesty awakes my heart to sing.
[822.62 --> 828.62]  How marvelous, how wonderful you are.
[828.62 --> 837.44]  Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore,
[837.44 --> 844.26]  beautiful one my soul must see.
[844.26 --> 852.26]  Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore,
[852.26 --> 859.26]  beautiful one my soul must see.
[859.26 --> 865.08]  You opened my eyes to your wonders anew.
[865.08 --> 868.08]  You captured my heart with this love.
[868.08 --> 874.08]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you.
[874.08 --> 880.08]  You opened my eyes to your wonders anew.
[880.08 --> 883.90]  You captured my heart with this love.
[883.90 --> 890.90]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you.
[890.90 --> 898.90]  Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore,
[898.90 --> 904.90]  beautiful one my soul must see.
[904.90 --> 921.72]  Beautiful one I adore, beautiful one my soul must see.
[921.72 --> 925.14]  My soul my soul must see.
[925.14 --> 929.08]  My soul my soul must see.
[929.08 --> 932.76]  My soul my soul must see.
[932.76 --> 945.76]  Beautiful one I adore, beautiful one my soul must see.
[945.76 --> 946.48]  You may be seated.
[948.10 --> 951.00]  So I want to invite up, before you guys get too comfortable,
[951.00 --> 954.94]  Colin and Angela McKenzie, who are becoming members today of
[954.94 --> 957.30]  Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[957.30 --> 961.18]  And I have asked Colin and Angela just to share a little bit
[961.18 --> 965.76]  about their journey or how they got here and why they are
[965.76 --> 968.12]  becoming members of Ladner CRC.
[972.12 --> 973.24]  Good morning.
[973.24 --> 976.76]  I'm Angela and this is my tall husband, Colin.
[976.76 --> 983.20]  I was born and raised in a Christian home in Hong Kong and my
[983.20 --> 984.70]  background is Pentecostal.
[984.70 --> 991.20]  I got baptized when I was 17 and I come to Canada when I was 19.
[991.20 --> 1001.08]  And we moved from Vancouver Island in the year of 2000 and we live in around five minutes from the church.
[1001.08 --> 1005.14]  We are neighbors of Nancy and Robin.
[1005.14 --> 1012.92]  The reason why I want to join this church, I have a paper for three points.
[1012.92 --> 1016.86]  The first one is the music.
[1016.86 --> 1019.36]  I was singing in the choir for many years.
[1019.36 --> 1021.86]  So music is very important to me.
[1021.86 --> 1025.86]  And when I first come to this church, I see the pipe organ.
[1025.86 --> 1028.86]  I said, wow, pipe organ.
[1028.86 --> 1031.80]  I haven't seen them in church for a long, long time.
[1031.80 --> 1038.30]  And the way this church worship is so respectful and worshipful.
[1038.30 --> 1044.30]  And for the first couple of months when I come to the worship, I cry.
[1044.30 --> 1048.24]  Because they sing so many songs I haven't sang before.
[1048.24 --> 1051.24]  The second one is a confession.
[1051.24 --> 1055.88]  For my Pentecostal upbringing, confession is everything.
[1055.88 --> 1058.18]  You repent and you confess.
[1058.18 --> 1061.58]  So week after week, I hear all these confession.
[1061.58 --> 1065.98]  I said, oh, it's really tough my heart's strength.
[1065.98 --> 1069.42]  And the third one is the icing of the cake.
[1069.42 --> 1071.76]  It's the preaching.
[1071.76 --> 1075.74]  Week after week, we hear all this preaching.
[1075.74 --> 1081.24]  It's motivated and inspired and challenged me at the same time.
[1081.24 --> 1086.62]  After I hear the message, I want to become a better person, a better Christian.
[1086.62 --> 1090.18]  Thank you, Jason, for speaking the truth in love.
[1090.18 --> 1094.68]  And last, I want to thank all the men in this church.
[1094.68 --> 1096.72]  You draw something out of my husband.
[1096.72 --> 1103.00]  He's shy, but now he's so excited to go to the breakfast every month.
[1103.00 --> 1104.50]  Thank you so much.
[1104.50 --> 1105.50]  Thank you.
[1111.24 --> 1116.62]  Hi, my name's Colin.
[1116.62 --> 1123.62]  I grew up in a Baptist church in Nanaimo and spent a lot of time with my maternal grandmother,
[1123.62 --> 1131.46]  who made sure I understood the gospel and made sure that I was ready to make a decision one
[1131.46 --> 1140.34]  day, which I did when I was 12 and a half, and was baptized the following year at Easter,
[1140.34 --> 1144.94]  because that's when they did baptisms in that church.
[1144.94 --> 1146.94]  I met Angela in...
[1146.94 --> 1147.94]  85.
[1147.94 --> 1148.94]  85.
[1148.94 --> 1154.98]  I know when we got married, but yeah.
[1154.98 --> 1160.92]  So we were attending a small non-denomination church in New Cluelet and moved to Port Alberni
[1160.92 --> 1167.72]  with the forest industry and attended a Baptist church there and then over here.
[1167.72 --> 1169.72]  And I think...
[1169.72 --> 1178.14]  I'll just say I was involved up to my ears and things in church.
[1178.14 --> 1179.88]  And COVID was a nice break.
[1179.88 --> 1183.88]  That's just a little ad there.
[1183.88 --> 1187.08]  Reasons why I'd like to become a member here is...
[1187.08 --> 1192.12]  Number one is...
[1192.12 --> 1194.20]  Early on, we took a shine.
[1194.20 --> 1200.20]  That means we really fell in love with the preaching here.
[1200.20 --> 1201.56]  Not just Jason.
[1201.56 --> 1202.64]  Jason was a big part of it.
[1202.64 --> 1209.02]  Every speaker that comes to a CRC church is solid.
[1209.02 --> 1210.02]  Just amazing.
[1210.02 --> 1211.38]  I love it.
[1211.38 --> 1212.38]  You guys are blessed.
[1212.38 --> 1214.38]  I'm going to be blessed now.
[1214.38 --> 1215.38]  I'm part of it.
[1215.38 --> 1219.96]  And the other thing is...
[1219.96 --> 1225.30]  My dad was not a Christian, but he went to a little church called Halliburton United
[1225.30 --> 1226.30]  every Sunday.
[1226.30 --> 1229.50]  And he said, if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you.
[1229.50 --> 1231.30]  And he didn't know I'd become a Christian.
[1231.30 --> 1236.30]  And I've kind of always tried...
[1236.30 --> 1241.48]  Oh, so in keeping with your examination, I thought I'd better use a reference here to
[1241.48 --> 1244.24]  Romans 12.
[1244.24 --> 1248.88]  I'm not necessarily a hand or definitely a reason here who's got a voice, but to become
[1248.88 --> 1254.00]  a part of the body, we feel like we have to join so that the hand isn't disconnected
[1254.00 --> 1258.98]  from the rest of the body or the voice isn't disconnected from the rest of the body.
[1258.98 --> 1261.22]  We work together when we're members.
[1261.22 --> 1262.22]  So at best.
[1262.22 --> 1265.22]  Anyway, that's it.
[1265.22 --> 1278.14]  So I'm talking to you, but I have to use the mic.
[1278.14 --> 1284.22]  Colin and Angela, in your baptism, you are marked as members of Christ Church universally.
[1284.22 --> 1288.84]  And it is our joy to welcome you today to be members of our congregation.
[1289.44 --> 1295.20]  We believe that the Holy Spirit has led you to this congregation at this time for your own
[1295.20 --> 1297.84]  good and for the good of this congregation.
[1297.84 --> 1304.28]  We invite you now to affirm your faith in Christ and express also your commitment to the life
[1304.28 --> 1307.32]  of this church and the mission that God has given us.
[1307.88 --> 1310.08]  So I'll ask you three vows.
[1311.44 --> 1315.18]  And I'll ask you to affirm your agreement and belief.
[1315.18 --> 1321.28]  Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[1321.94 --> 1326.12]  Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1326.78 --> 1330.96]  And do you, with repentance and joy, embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1334.82 --> 1336.10]  We got to hear it.
[1336.34 --> 1337.22]  We all want to hear it.
[1337.88 --> 1338.00]  Okay.
[1338.46 --> 1342.98]  Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God, revealing Christ in his redemption,
[1342.98 --> 1347.28]  and that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[1348.56 --> 1349.10]  We do.
[1349.82 --> 1354.70]  Do you promise to join with us, sharing your gifts in our worship and fellowship,
[1355.14 --> 1357.34]  and in the mission God has given us in the world?
[1357.80 --> 1358.36]  We do.
[1358.62 --> 1358.90]  Okay.
[1359.10 --> 1359.68]  Praise the Lord.
[1360.68 --> 1362.94]  And congregation, we have a vow for you as well.
[1364.58 --> 1366.14]  It's on the next slide.
[1366.14 --> 1366.70]  Okay.
[1367.88 --> 1372.78]  Do you promise to receive Colin and Angela in love as your brother
[1372.78 --> 1374.02]  and sister in Christ?
[1374.64 --> 1377.00]  Support them with your fellowship and prayers,
[1377.20 --> 1382.20]  and recognizing their gifts, invite them into the life and mission of our congregation.
[1382.98 --> 1383.68]  We do.
[1384.80 --> 1389.06]  Then, we officially welcome you as members of Ladner CRC.
[1389.06 --> 1389.62]  Thank you.
[1395.20 --> 1398.14]  Let me pray for us, and then I have something for you.
[1398.28 --> 1398.74]  So let's pray.
[1398.74 --> 1405.96]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you knit us together, you weave us together,
[1405.96 --> 1413.30]  people from all the nations, from different backgrounds, different experiences of your grace in our lives.
[1414.16 --> 1417.72]  But, Lord, you bring us together for this time and in this place,
[1418.08 --> 1420.14]  and you make us one body in Christ.
[1420.14 --> 1430.42]  And, Lord, we just pray for Colin and Angela, that you would bless them richly as they become involved in this congregation.
[1430.68 --> 1432.76]  Lord, help them to make good relationships here.
[1433.18 --> 1440.84]  We pray that you would help them to grow spiritually, to become more and more conformed to the image of Christ.
[1440.84 --> 1449.10]  And, Lord, as Colin said, would we be one body that serves and helps one another with all that you have blessed us with.
[1449.60 --> 1451.28]  Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[1452.28 --> 1454.74]  We thank you for your goodness to us.
[1454.84 --> 1456.00]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1456.42 --> 1456.78]  Amen.
[1456.78 --> 1456.86]  Amen.
[1456.86 --> 1456.90]  Amen.
[1456.90 --> 1456.92]  Amen.
[1470.84 --> 1477.68]  All right, so let's all stand and we'll sing one more song of praise and adoration this morning.
[1477.78 --> 1478.38]  Amen.
[1478.78 --> 1479.30]  Amen.
[1479.34 --> 1481.26]  Amen.
[1481.98 --> 1483.90]  Amen.
[1483.90 --> 1485.68]  Amen.
[1486.50 --> 1487.88]  Amen.
[1487.88 --> 1489.38]  Amen.
[1489.62 --> 1490.56]  Amen.
[1491.16 --> 1492.32]  Amen.
[1494.40 --> 1496.70]  Amen.
[1497.80 --> 1498.30]  Amen.
[1498.32 --> 1499.46]  Amen.
[1499.46 --> 1500.46]  Amen.
[1529.46 --> 1535.68]  Hold wounds which tell me, come.
[1536.38 --> 1546.46]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, my unworthy soul is one.
[1546.46 --> 1559.46]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, his family is my own.
[1559.46 --> 1570.46]  Once strangers chasing selfish streets, now born through grace alone.
[1570.46 --> 1582.64]  How good I now deserve the ones that you have loved.
[1583.18 --> 1593.46]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, see the children called by God.
[1593.46 --> 1606.46]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, the path before the ground.
[1606.46 --> 1617.46]  We follow in his footsteps, where promised hope is found.
[1619.26 --> 1629.46]  How great the joy be for us, to be his perfect bride.
[1629.46 --> 1641.46]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, we will gladly lift our eyes.
[1648.46 --> 1649.68]  You may be seated.
[1649.68 --> 1655.24]  We come now to our time of confession.
[1656.84 --> 1662.02]  And first I want to share a call to confession from Isaiah 55.
[1662.70 --> 1664.36]  The prophet Isaiah declared,
[1665.82 --> 1668.60]  Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[1669.68 --> 1672.64]  Call on him while he is near.
[1672.64 --> 1678.42]  Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[1678.42 --> 1682.72]  Let them turn to the Lord and he will have mercy on them.
[1683.38 --> 1687.38]  And to our God, for he will freely pardon.
[1688.58 --> 1696.22]  The reason we have a time of confession every time we gather together is in one sense as a safeguard.
[1696.88 --> 1704.48]  It is to protect that which is most important, which is our relationship with the God who has called us.
[1704.48 --> 1713.24]  And anybody in a marriage or in a friendship knows that you don't want anything to get in between you and that person that you love.
[1714.32 --> 1716.42]  And in the same way, that's what we do with God.
[1716.54 --> 1719.30]  We ask him and we say,
[1719.30 --> 1723.96]  Lord, if there is anything that would be an offense to you,
[1724.42 --> 1729.74]  if there's anything that is robbing the joy of knowing you and being in a relationship with you,
[1729.80 --> 1734.88]  would you show it to me so that I can then repent and turn from it?
[1735.68 --> 1737.46]  And that's what confession is all about.
[1737.46 --> 1740.76]  And so I'm going to lead us in a prayer of confession.
[1741.38 --> 1749.22]  And then we are just going to take a moment and ask God who is gracious and who is merciful to reveal to our own hearts
[1749.22 --> 1754.32]  if there are areas in our lives that he wants us to deal with.
[1754.98 --> 1758.58]  And so that we can enjoy the best of him.
[1759.32 --> 1761.60]  So please join me as I lead us in this prayer.
[1761.60 --> 1768.98]  Most merciful and gracious Father, we acknowledge and confess before you
[1768.98 --> 1774.76]  our sinful natures are prone to do evil and slow to do good.
[1775.92 --> 1780.76]  You alone know how often we have sinned in wandering from your ways,
[1781.68 --> 1785.88]  in wasting your gifts, and in forgetting your love.
[1785.88 --> 1790.28]  We are sorry for all the ways in which we have displeased you.
[1791.36 --> 1798.34]  So now we ask that you would search our hearts in a moment of silent confession.
[1798.34 --> 1801.80]  An
[1805.98 --> 1807.20]  mercy
[1807.20 --> 1809.50]  waiting
[1809.50 --> 1812.16]  but
[1812.16 --> 1814.60]  after
[1814.60 --> 1817.22]  you
[1817.22 --> 1819.36]  well
[1819.36 --> 1820.54]  then
[1820.54 --> 1821.46]  you
[1821.46 --> 1834.60]  Merciful Lord, we thank you for the grace to come before you freely through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1835.74 --> 1840.40]  Lord, would you cleanse us from our wandering ways and forgive our sins through Jesus Christ,
[1840.48 --> 1845.72]  our Savior. Grant us your power that we might live in your light and walk in your ways
[1845.72 --> 1851.44]  according to the commandments of Jesus Christ, our Lord. And we pray this in his name.
[1852.28 --> 1860.60]  Amen. So as we always do after confessing our sin to God, we look to Jesus, we look to him,
[1861.26 --> 1869.16]  and we seek to hear from him words of grace and pardon, forgiveness and mercy. So we hear these
[1869.16 --> 1876.54]  words today from Psalm 103 and hear what the Lord says. The Lord is compassionate and gracious,
[1876.54 --> 1884.58]  slow to anger, abounding in love. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love
[1884.58 --> 1892.48]  for those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions
[1892.48 --> 1900.00]  from us. Friends, that is the good news. Let's stand one more time and let's sing another song, a song
[1900.00 --> 1901.48]  of renewal together.
[1901.48 --> 1915.14]  How deep the Father's love for us, how fast beyond all measure,
[1915.14 --> 1945.12]  that he should give his only Son to make the wretch his treasure. How great the
[1945.12 --> 1966.50]  God of searing loss. The Father turns his face away. As wounds which mark the chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
[1966.50 --> 1968.50]  God of searing loss.
[1968.50 --> 1980.50]  God of searing loss. The Lord is a blessing. Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders.
[1980.50 --> 1994.50]  God of searing loss. Asshamed I hear my mocking voice, call out among the scoffers.
[1994.50 --> 2010.48]  It was my sin that held him there, until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me
[2010.48 --> 2040.46]  life. I know that it is finished. I will not boast in anything. No gifts, no power, no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ.
[2040.46 --> 2070.44]  His death and resurrection. Why should I gain thou his reward? I cannot hear the answer. But this I know with all my heart. His wounds have paid my rest.
[2070.44 --> 2072.44]  The Lord is a blessing.
[2072.44 --> 2073.44]  The Lord is a blessing.
[2073.44 --> 2074.44]  The Lord is a blessing.
[2074.44 --> 2076.44]  Amen.
[2076.44 --> 2077.44]  Amen.
[2077.44 --> 2087.88]  So at this time, the children and our Sunday school teachers are dismissed to go to their classrooms.
[2087.88 --> 2094.88]  And let us here prepare our hearts for the hearing of God's word.
[2094.88 --> 2117.98]  The reading this morning is from Malachi 2, verses 10 to 16, which you can find in the Pew Bibles, page 713. Malachi 2.
[2117.98 --> 2132.98]  Do we not all have one father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another?
[2132.98 --> 2141.98]  Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.
[2141.98 --> 2161.98]  Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship a foreign God. As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord remove him from the tents of Jacob.
[2161.98 --> 2168.98]  Judah means the sons of Jacob. Even though he brings an offering to the Lord almighty.
[2168.98 --> 2183.98]  Another thing you do, you flood the Lord's altar with tears. You weep and wail. Because he no longer looks with favour on your offerings, or accept them with pleasure from your hands.
[2183.98 --> 2193.58]  hands. You ask why? It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth.
[2194.50 --> 2201.96]  You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.
[2203.64 --> 2212.46]  Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God
[2212.46 --> 2221.16]  seek? Godly offspring. So be on your guard and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.
[2222.72 --> 2230.20]  The man who hates and divorces his wife, says the Lord, the God of Israel, does violence to the one
[2230.20 --> 2239.68]  he should protect, says the Lord Almighty. So be on your guard and do not be unfaithful.
[2239.68 --> 2242.74]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2243.40 --> 2244.64]  Praise to you, Lord.
[2258.86 --> 2259.56]  Let's pray.
[2259.56 --> 2271.48]  Father, we thank you that you have removed our shame in Christ. And for that, we are joyful.
[2272.76 --> 2279.98]  We come before you this morning, Father, seeking a blessing, seeking instruction from the book of
[2279.98 --> 2287.14]  Malachi. So Lord, would you take us through these difficult words with your grace and your peace
[2287.14 --> 2291.28]  and your joy? We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2293.20 --> 2298.92]  So we are in the church season of Lent. And during this season, we have been looking at the Old
[2298.92 --> 2306.24]  Testament book of Malachi. It's the last book in your Old Testament. So if you can find the gospel
[2306.24 --> 2310.64]  of Matthew, you just go back one book and there you are, Malachi.
[2310.64 --> 2317.94]  And so I want to take a moment to remind us of what's going on in the book of Malachi briefly here.
[2318.54 --> 2328.02]  So Malachi is designed as a series of disputes that God has with his people. The Israelites had
[2328.02 --> 2335.42]  recently been living in exile in Babylon, and now they have returned to the land of Judah,
[2335.42 --> 2342.42]  but in returning, they have not yet returned to God in their hearts and in their lives.
[2343.36 --> 2351.44]  But God still loves his people. So the first thing he does is he assures them of his love for them.
[2351.54 --> 2354.64]  He says right off the bat in chapter 1, verse 2,
[2355.36 --> 2361.04]  I have loved you, says the Lord. Right? And so before any issue is addressed,
[2361.04 --> 2371.06]  God reminds Israel of his faithful love for them. And what God wants, what God hopes for,
[2371.48 --> 2381.76]  is for them to return to him, for his people to treat him again as their God in their hearts and in
[2381.76 --> 2389.96]  their lives. And that's why God then confronts their sin and their unfaithfulness.
[2389.96 --> 2394.88]  And we see in these disputes, God says, well, this is what you're doing. And they're always like,
[2394.98 --> 2399.42]  what? You know, what's going on? Why are you saying that? So in a sense, they're spiritually
[2399.42 --> 2406.08]  unaware of the way that they are offending God. And so God confronts them. He challenges them.
[2406.14 --> 2412.48]  He calls them back to faithfulness. So now this morning, we are looking at the third dispute.
[2412.48 --> 2420.10]  And it's actually one of the most important passages in the Bible about marriage. You may
[2420.10 --> 2425.84]  not have known that this little passage about marriage is buried back here in the book of Malachi.
[2427.14 --> 2434.94]  And I think this passage talks about two of the most pressing topics around marriage,
[2434.94 --> 2440.86]  and it puts them all into one passage for us. Because this passage talks about a Christian
[2440.86 --> 2447.98]  marrying a non-Christian. What does God say about that? And this passage also talks about divorce
[2447.98 --> 2455.74]  and the Lord's opposition to divorce. These are the two main thrusts of this passage. And these are
[2455.74 --> 2461.38]  issues that God's people have always struggled with all the way back in Malachi. And it's,
[2461.38 --> 2468.34]  there are things that we continue to struggle with today as God's people. And so this is something
[2468.34 --> 2475.82]  that we too need to be reminded of. And I realize these are challenging topics. These are tender topics.
[2476.68 --> 2485.10]  But we see that God is not sentimental about these things. He speaks frankly with us as our Heavenly
[2485.10 --> 2491.36]  Father who loves us. So we should listen. We should hear what He has to say. And so we're
[2491.36 --> 2496.40]  going to study this passage this morning in three parts. First, we're going to talk about
[2496.40 --> 2503.00]  the unfaithfulness of mixed marriage, which means a Christian marrying a non-Christian.
[2503.94 --> 2509.68]  Then secondly, the unfaithfulness of divorce. But then thirdly, the faithfulness of God.
[2510.64 --> 2518.02]  Because I want you to leave today knowing how much God loves marriage. Because a faithful marriage
[2518.02 --> 2524.38]  is a picture of God's faithfulness to us. So that's where we're going this morning. And so let's jump
[2524.38 --> 2530.54]  right in and let's look at the first point, the unfaithfulness of mixed marriage. This passage
[2530.54 --> 2540.82]  presents a picture of God's grief, God's annoyance with His bride nation Israel, who has thrown God out
[2540.82 --> 2547.34]  and has taken to themselves other gods. That's what's happening. So let's look here at verse 10
[2547.34 --> 2553.76]  in our passage. Now, I think one thing you should know about this passage of Malachi is that there
[2553.76 --> 2560.10]  are parts of this that are some of the most difficult to translate, according to scholars,
[2560.30 --> 2566.18]  in the Bible. So I don't know the Bibles in your pew NIV 84. They may, I didn't even check it. I'm just
[2566.18 --> 2571.86]  guessing. It may be significantly more different than what you might see. I don't know. But follow
[2571.86 --> 2576.00]  along the screen. You can also have the Bible open in front of you. But there may be some differences
[2576.00 --> 2583.00]  of translation because some of the Hebrew, evidently, I've read is just unclear what actually
[2583.00 --> 2592.84]  is being said. But I think what we do have in the scriptures is as reliable of what God is saying.
[2592.84 --> 2596.92]  There may be some nuances, though, that are different depending on the translation. So anyway,
[2597.02 --> 2605.70]  though, let's look at verse 10. Do we not all have one father? Did not one God create us? Why do we
[2605.70 --> 2612.74]  profane the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another? Now, notice the language
[2612.74 --> 2620.82]  God uses here. He says, what are they profaning here? The covenant. Okay, they're profaning the covenant
[2620.82 --> 2627.12]  of their ancestors. See, so what happened is God and Israel made a covenant together. They were bound
[2627.12 --> 2637.08]  together in a way that is very much like marriage vows. In a sense, Israel was married to Yahweh,
[2637.20 --> 2643.48]  their God. That's what a covenant is all about. Out of all the people on the face of the earth,
[2643.58 --> 2650.74]  God chose to be in a covenant relationship with these people, the Israelites. They were his bride.
[2650.82 --> 2659.22]  But Israel had broken their covenant vows. They had been unfaithful to God. So look at verse 11.
[2659.98 --> 2666.86]  It says, Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.
[2667.68 --> 2674.88]  Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship a foreign God.
[2674.88 --> 2683.54]  God's people have been unfaithful, God says, because they have taken to themselves other gods.
[2683.98 --> 2688.68]  They have thrown God out. They had chased after other gods. And they did this by intermarrying
[2688.68 --> 2696.14]  with those who were not believers. People of the surrounding nations who didn't follow Yahweh,
[2696.14 --> 2704.66]  the God of Israel, marrying wives of the peoples who were devoted to their own gods, the gods of their
[2704.66 --> 2713.62]  ancestors. And this was expressly forbidden in the Old Testament. Right? Before God allowed his people
[2713.62 --> 2718.80]  to enter into the land that he was going to give them, after he had brought them out of slavery in
[2718.80 --> 2725.28]  Egypt, he gave them the law that they were to follow as his people. And one of those commands was that
[2725.28 --> 2733.60]  they were not to marry people who were already in the land. So look with me at Deuteronomy chapter 7,
[2734.20 --> 2740.10]  verses 3 to 4. We have it here on the screen. God says, do not intermarry with them. Do not give
[2740.10 --> 2745.48]  your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, for they will turn your children away
[2745.48 --> 2753.94]  from following me to serve other gods. So we see here God's people are not to marry people from the
[2753.94 --> 2759.36]  surrounding nations because they're going to turn you away from following the Lord. Now I want to be
[2759.36 --> 2768.50]  very, very clear here. God is not opposed to mixed marriages for cultural or racial reasons. Right? A
[2768.50 --> 2775.46]  mixed marriage is not a black person marrying a white person. It's not a Pakistani marrying a Chinese
[2775.48 --> 2781.30]  that's not what God is talking about. Right? In the great book of Ruth, for instance, Boaz is a
[2781.30 --> 2788.10]  righteous man, an Israelite, who marries a Moabite, a woman from another nation whose name is Ruth. God
[2788.10 --> 2795.62]  blesses this marriage because Ruth had committed herself to worshiping Yahweh, the God of Israel. And so
[2795.62 --> 2805.46]  the issue is not ethnicity, it's about the God you worship. A mixed marriage is a person who knows God,
[2805.46 --> 2811.28]  a person who is justified by faith in Jesus Christ, a person who is a born-again Christian,
[2811.28 --> 2817.12]  who then enters into a covenant relationship with someone who does not know Jesus Christ,
[2817.12 --> 2823.72]  who is not a Christian. And so God is saying, if you are going to share your life
[2823.72 --> 2834.08]  with someone in marriage, then their devotion to the Lord, the God they worship, that must be the same
[2834.08 --> 2842.44]  God that you worship. It has to be. And friends, what this means is that a Christian should not marry
[2842.44 --> 2850.10]  someone who is not a Christian. If you are a committed Christian and you are dating or you are thinking
[2850.10 --> 2859.36]  about dating someone who is not a follower of Jesus, think again. It doesn't matter how great you think
[2859.36 --> 2867.64]  they look in skinny jeans. It doesn't matter how perfect of a fit their personality is with yours.
[2868.46 --> 2874.14]  It does not matter how much you have in common. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you are in
[2874.14 --> 2882.60]  love. Whatever feeling of love that you may have does not suddenly override what God says in his word.
[2883.36 --> 2888.36]  What matters before all of these things is that they know and that they love Jesus.
[2889.82 --> 2894.12]  And I know if you're single and you're wanting to get married that that is hard to hear.
[2894.12 --> 2904.04]  But I want you to hear it as from your heavenly father who loves you. And he is giving you important
[2904.04 --> 2909.44]  wisdom and direction in marriage. Because if you're a Christian and you marry a non-Christian,
[2910.28 --> 2917.92]  one of two things likely will happen. On the one hand, if the Lord is the most important thing at the
[2917.92 --> 2925.66]  center of your life, and you can't share the deepest thing about who you are with the person you marry,
[2925.80 --> 2930.86]  you have a real lack of intimacy there. And so you have to keep that person at a distance.
[2931.22 --> 2941.44]  There's something central about you that is hidden, in a sense, from them. That's one way it might work.
[2941.44 --> 2947.92]  Or if you're going to let the person into the center of your heart, you're going to have to push the Lord
[2947.92 --> 2957.56]  to the edge. And so the Lord won't be the center of your life. And it is very difficult to walk with
[2957.56 --> 2962.96]  the Lord if you marry someone who is not a Christian, who doesn't share your faith.
[2962.96 --> 2970.88]  This week I learned about the marriage, as an example, of the American writer Mark Twain, who I love his
[2970.88 --> 2979.36]  writing, and his wife Olivia. Olivia had been raised in a Christian home. She was a committed Christian.
[2980.48 --> 2985.86]  Mark Twain, as much as I like his writing, he is openly critical of religion, especially Christianity.
[2986.74 --> 2991.58]  But when Mark Twain came calling, Olivia eventually accepted the marriage proposal.
[2991.58 --> 2997.98]  Early on in their marriage, one of Twain's friends, who knew him as a critic of Christianity,
[2998.18 --> 3004.02]  he came to visit the couple. And he was pretty shocked and amused to see his friend praying
[3004.02 --> 3010.94]  and joining in family worship that Olivia had established. But eventually, after the honeymoon
[3010.94 --> 3013.78]  period had worn off, Mark Twain said to his wife,
[3014.30 --> 3019.54]  Livy, you may keep this up if you want to, but I must ask you to excuse me from it.
[3019.54 --> 3026.08]  I don't believe in the Bible. I can't sit here and listen to it, letting you believe that I regard
[3026.08 --> 3032.32]  it as you do as the Word of God. Right? And, you know, when that happens, that must have been so
[3032.32 --> 3038.64]  devastating for Olivia. But what's even more tragic is that she then began to doubt and question her
[3038.64 --> 3045.70]  own faith. Right? Years later, as a couple, they went through together a time of bereavement. And Mark
[3045.70 --> 3050.90]  Twain, he tried to encourage his wife. He said, Livy, if it comforts you to lean on your Christian faith,
[3051.04 --> 3057.06]  then do so. I can't, she replied. I don't have any faith.
[3057.06 --> 3067.46]  And I think many of us here know just how common this is. And on the one hand, we understand, you know,
[3067.72 --> 3074.38]  why, we understand why Christians would not marry, will marry non-Christians. Right? They say,
[3074.60 --> 3081.84]  I'm afraid I'm not going to meet someone. Right? I'm afraid that if I'm serious about only dating and
[3081.84 --> 3086.66]  marrying someone who is a follower of Jesus, it might mean that I never get married.
[3088.74 --> 3093.24]  But the alternative is marrying someone who's going to lead you away from Jesus.
[3094.26 --> 3101.68]  Someone who is not on the same page of who you are and what life is all about. And if Malachi is
[3101.68 --> 3107.74]  any indication, that sacrifice is not worth making. Because the alternative is the risk of losing Jesus.
[3107.74 --> 3116.68]  Now, let's move on to the second thing God addresses here, which is the unfaithfulness of divorce.
[3118.02 --> 3124.76]  Okay. The problem in Israel, what's going on, is not just that there's this wave of Israelites
[3124.76 --> 3131.20]  marrying outside of the covenant. It's what they're doing in order to do that, which is that they are
[3131.20 --> 3137.72]  divorcing their wives. Right? So think about this. Use your imagination. You have these families.
[3137.74 --> 3146.94]  Husband, wife, children. They were in exile in Babylon. Whatever that situation looked like. I can't
[3146.94 --> 3153.64]  imagine it was easy. They had traveled now hundreds of miles, hundreds of kilometers, back to the land.
[3154.42 --> 3159.54]  They get there. Things are in a bit of shambles. They're trying to rebuild. They're trying to resettle.
[3160.08 --> 3164.32]  They don't know anyone. They've lost family connections. They've lost friendships.
[3164.32 --> 3172.24]  And their husbands and their fathers say, well, I'm done with you. Right? I'm going to marry this other
[3172.24 --> 3178.76]  woman and be part of her people so you can just fend for yourselves. You have no one to provide for
[3178.76 --> 3187.94]  you. I don't care. It's enough to make you absolutely furious. At least God is absolutely
[3187.94 --> 3196.24]  furious. And in the midst of this treachery, the people keep coming to God with their offerings and
[3196.24 --> 3202.98]  their sacrifices as though they are not doing anything wrong. But God is not accepting their
[3202.98 --> 3208.64]  offerings. God is not listening to their prayers. And so the people are crying about this. So look at
[3208.64 --> 3211.76]  verse 13. This is what God says.
[3211.76 --> 3218.54]  Another thing you do. You flood the Lord's altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer
[3218.54 --> 3224.52]  looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. You ask, why?
[3226.30 --> 3231.04]  Right? So the people, they find out God is angry with them. He doesn't want their offerings anymore.
[3231.20 --> 3238.48]  God says, I don't even want you to come and worship me on Sundays. And Israel says, well, what's wrong with
[3238.48 --> 3247.36]  you? And God says, this is what's wrong with me. Look at verse 14. Why am I angry with you? Well, here's
[3247.36 --> 3253.50]  the answer. It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have
[3253.50 --> 3258.10]  been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.
[3259.54 --> 3266.14]  Why doesn't God accept our offerings, they ask? Well, could it be because you're divorcing your wives?
[3266.14 --> 3275.68]  Right? Maybe that's what's going on here. And this isn't just something that happened in ancient
[3275.68 --> 3286.74]  Israel. In 1 Peter chapter 3, God tells husbands this. Husbands, in the same way, be considerate as you
[3286.74 --> 3292.88]  live with your wives. Treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the
[3292.88 --> 3305.22]  gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers. Right? In Israel, they were divorcing
[3305.22 --> 3310.10]  their wives. They were treating them disrespectfully and God was not listening to their prayers. He
[3310.10 --> 3318.28]  wasn't accepting their offerings. And today, too, God cares about spouses. In some ways, our prayers are
[3318.28 --> 3325.84]  hindered whenever we are not respecting our spouse. God is making a profound point here that your
[3325.84 --> 3331.98]  relationship with him is connected with our relationships with each other in marriage.
[3332.74 --> 3339.86]  Those things are connected far more than we can understand or that we realize.
[3339.86 --> 3350.64]  What happens in marriage affects God directly. Or in other words, to sin against your spouse is to sin
[3350.64 --> 3360.02]  against God. And the reason for that is because God is deeply invested in our marriages. The Lord says,
[3360.02 --> 3368.24]  I was there on the day you got married. I heard the vows that you made to one another. I was the witness.
[3369.32 --> 3375.96]  And as a witness, he gave approval to that marriage. And he would certainly not give his approval to that
[3375.96 --> 3383.50]  divorce. God says, I have purposes for your marriage here. In Malachi, he tells us two purposes for marriage.
[3383.50 --> 3391.06]  First, it's through marriage that God gives people a partner. Look again at verse 14. He says,
[3391.24 --> 3396.20]  you have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.
[3397.66 --> 3403.16]  Right? So through marriage, God gives us a partner. He delights in doing that. He makes this friendship,
[3403.96 --> 3411.72]  this relationship that we have through this covenant of marriage. And then secondly, if you look at verse 15,
[3411.72 --> 3417.80]  what is God's purpose in marriage? It says, and what does the God, what does the Lord,
[3418.98 --> 3427.40]  the God? It's probably wrong. What does God seek? Godly offspring. So one aspect of that partnership
[3427.40 --> 3434.00]  in marriage is to raise children who know and love God. To raise children who worship him and adore him.
[3434.20 --> 3440.94]  The results are in God's hands, but that's one of the tasks, the duties of this partnership that God
[3440.94 --> 3448.76]  has made in Christian marriage. And yet, having abandoned their wives and their children in order
[3448.76 --> 3456.94]  to marry these women who do not know God, they have destroyed God's purpose in marriage. They have
[3456.94 --> 3462.30]  abandoned the covenant partner that God had given them, and they abandoned their duty to raise children
[3462.30 --> 3467.84]  to know and worship God. And then they think that they can just continue to come and bring their
[3467.84 --> 3474.94]  offerings to God as if everything is actually just fine. And God says it is very much not fine. It is not
[3474.94 --> 3481.50]  okay. And so that's the text, right? That's what it says. But then the question has to be, well, what is,
[3482.34 --> 3485.96]  what does it say to us today? What do we do with this?
[3485.96 --> 3496.90]  For those who are married, the message of Malachi is simple. God loves marriage. He is deeply invested
[3496.90 --> 3502.92]  in marriage. He wants our marriages to last. He wants it to last right up to when we finally,
[3503.94 --> 3512.38]  that relationship is finally broken by death. That is the ideal of marriage. Why does divorce happen?
[3512.38 --> 3518.20]  Malachi tells us it is because we have failed to love the wives and the husbands of our youth.
[3520.84 --> 3525.48]  We start loving other things. We love ourselves. We love our comfort, our preferences.
[3527.42 --> 3536.12]  We forget. We fail to love the wives, the husbands of our youth. We forget that I am to lay down my life
[3536.12 --> 3543.36]  for her. I am to be faithful to her and love her as though my life were bound up with hers, which in fact
[3543.36 --> 3551.66]  it is. We left our mothers and our fathers and were joined together as one. And so of course, divorce is
[3551.66 --> 3559.68]  violence to that. It's dividing that one flesh union. Now, lest you think I'm saying that marriage is all
[3559.68 --> 3568.64]  sunshine and rainbows. It's not, right? Marriage is hard. It's often much harder than we would ever even imagine
[3568.64 --> 3576.42]  going into it. And we should acknowledge that not every divorce is against God's will. God makes allowances
[3576.42 --> 3584.68]  for divorce in situations where there is adultery or abuse or abandonment. If somebody has broken the one flesh
[3584.68 --> 3592.56]  covenantal union that badly, you can leave. And essentially, divorce in those situations would
[3592.56 --> 3597.88]  only be somebody getting a piece of paper that makes official what has already happened spiritually.
[3599.16 --> 3606.92]  Now, with that being said, Malachi here is talking about a specific type of divorce. He's talking about
[3606.92 --> 3614.20]  wrongful divorce. He's talking about sending away your spouse in a wicked way, in an unloving, a selfish way.
[3614.68 --> 3625.20]  And he ends the passage in verse 16. And he says, So be on your guard. Do not be unfaithful.
[3627.56 --> 3637.08]  So for those who are married, Malachi would say to us, fight for your marriage. Fight for the bride of your
[3637.08 --> 3643.20]  youth. Fight for the husband of your youth, the covenant partner that God has given you.
[3643.20 --> 3650.64]  Marriage is hard. There will be tears. But it is a beautiful expression of God's faithfulness to us,
[3650.68 --> 3655.28]  his people, whenever a husband and a wife are committed to upholding that covenant,
[3655.96 --> 3663.20]  those covenant vows. So God says, don't settle for anything less than this ideal that he is calling us
[3663.20 --> 3668.86]  to. And that leads us to the final point this morning, which is the faithfulness of God.
[3668.86 --> 3679.26]  Judah has been unfaithful to the covenant, it says. Right? God's bride, Israel, they have abandoned God.
[3679.34 --> 3686.46]  They have gone after other gods. They have committed spiritual adultery. And the result of this behavior,
[3686.60 --> 3692.46]  the result of the spiritual idolatry that the people are guilty of, the result is divorce.
[3692.46 --> 3699.16]  If they will not repent, God says, I will send them away. So read along with me in verse 12.
[3701.44 --> 3707.68]  As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord remove him from the tents of Jacob,
[3708.44 --> 3715.22]  even though he brings an offering to the Lord Almighty. Right? The truth about our spiritual condition
[3715.22 --> 3723.98]  is that we have been unfaithful to God time and time again. In our hearts, we have all worshipped other gods.
[3724.60 --> 3729.78]  We have all put something other than God at the center of our lives, at the center of our devotions,
[3730.18 --> 3737.74]  what we seek after. And yet, instead of sending us away, giving us a certificate of divorce,
[3737.74 --> 3745.84]  what has God done of the church? Jesus is the husband who is willing not only to forgive us for
[3745.84 --> 3754.08]  our constant adultery, for our constant going after other gods, but who actually gave his life in order
[3754.08 --> 3762.14]  to make us his bride, to bind us to himself in covenant love and faithfulness. I love this line
[3762.14 --> 3767.18]  from the hymn, The Church's One Foundation. It says this,
[3767.50 --> 3775.90]  From heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride. With his own blood he bought her, and for her life he died.
[3777.24 --> 3784.48]  And that's why marriage is a picture. It's not pointing to our faithfulness to one another,
[3784.82 --> 3789.54]  as up and down as that may be, but only it points to the faithfulness of God.
[3789.54 --> 3795.38]  And that's why we should be thankful to God for Jesus, who has shown us what a faithful husband
[3795.38 --> 3801.26]  is supposed to look like. And so friends, whether this morning you are single, whether you are married,
[3801.68 --> 3808.94]  ultimately we belong to Jesus. He is the spouse that we were made for, he is the spouse that we
[3808.94 --> 3814.06]  were redeemed for, and he is always faithful. Let's pray.
[3814.06 --> 3827.98]  Father, we see such a hard passage in Malachi. And it's hard because it challenges us.
[3829.34 --> 3838.04]  But Lord, it also points to your everlasting covenantal love, your faithfulness to us, your people.
[3838.04 --> 3843.32]  Lord, we, I just pray for each marriage in this room.
[3845.24 --> 3848.72]  I pray for those who, whose lives have been
[3848.72 --> 3853.06]  disrupted by the pain and the messiness of divorce.
[3854.42 --> 3859.72]  And Lord, I pray for all of us here who are single and desire to be married. Lord, you know
[3859.72 --> 3863.62]  each of our situations. Lord, you know
[3863.62 --> 3866.84]  where we need your love.
[3867.56 --> 3870.18]  Lord, we know where you need to bind up
[3870.18 --> 3871.32]  our wounds.
[3872.44 --> 3875.42]  And Lord, would you strengthen us in you? Would you help us
[3875.42 --> 3877.66]  Lord, to love you and to rest
[3877.66 --> 3880.06]  in the joy, the peace
[3880.06 --> 3881.86]  of knowing you
[3881.86 --> 3884.20]  and the covenantal love that you have for us.
[3884.32 --> 3885.38]  Lord, be with us, your people.
[3886.32 --> 3888.00]  And Lord, help us to be faithful to you.
[3888.00 --> 3891.36]  Help us to return to the Lord. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[3893.16 --> 3897.42]  Now, our song of response is one that Mel chose for us and is called,
[3897.42 --> 3899.34]  Oh, my people, turn to me.
[3900.38 --> 3902.48]  It's a very fitting song of response.
[3902.64 --> 3905.28]  It's because that is what God's message
[3905.28 --> 3907.46]  is to us through Malachi.
[3908.26 --> 3909.84]  Oh, my people, turn to me.
[3910.46 --> 3911.84]  And it says this one line,
[3911.98 --> 3913.66]  Oh, my people, turn to me,
[3914.04 --> 3915.64]  says the Lord, your gracious God.
[3915.64 --> 3918.36]  I will heal your faithlessness.
[3919.14 --> 3920.28]  I will love you.
[3920.90 --> 3921.76]  And I will bless.
[3922.40 --> 3924.60]  So let's stand and let's sing this together.
[3925.46 --> 3926.64]  It might be new words,
[3926.74 --> 3928.34]  but it should be to a familiar tune.
[3928.34 --> 3931.32]  Amen.
[3931.32 --> 3931.84]  Amen.
[3931.84 --> 3932.20]  Come on.
[3934.24 --> 3934.96]  Amen.
[3934.96 --> 3935.78]  Amen
[3935.78 --> 3936.42]  Amen.
[3936.42 --> 3937.22]  Amen.
[3937.22 --> 3937.78]  Amen.
[3937.78 --> 3938.16]  Amen.
[3941.10 --> 3941.98]  Amen.
[3941.98 --> 3942.80]  Amen.
[3942.80 --> 3947.40]  Amen.
[3947.40 --> 3947.74]  Amen.
[3948.34 --> 3949.34]  Amen.
[3949.34 --> 3950.44]  Amen.
[3950.44 --> 3951.82]  Amen.
[3951.82 --> 3952.16]  Amen.
[3952.24 --> 3954.62]  Amen.
[3954.84 --> 3955.34]  Amen.
[3955.34 --> 3955.82]  Amen.
[3955.82 --> 3967.50]  Oh, my people, turn to me, says the Lord, your gracious God.
[3967.50 --> 3979.48]  I will heal your faithlessness. I will love you and will bless.
[3979.48 --> 3991.34]  I will be like you on farms, like a living you shall know.
[3992.06 --> 4003.50]  Oh, my people, turn to me, says the Lord, your gracious God.
[4003.50 --> 4017.50]  Oh, my people, turn to me, says the Lord, your gracious God.
[4019.16 --> 4030.50]  You shall spread regions like a tree, lovely as an olive tree.
[4030.50 --> 4044.60]  You shall blossom like a vine, fragrant with a scent of wine.
[4045.40 --> 4057.50]  Oh, my people, turn to me, says the Lord, your gracious God.
[4057.50 --> 4075.12]  Oh, my people, turn to me, says the Lord, your gracious God.
[4075.12 --> 4082.98]  Yes. You know, in the gospel, God demands everything from us. He demands our life.
[4083.50 --> 4089.14]  He demands our trust. He demands our worship. He demands all our possessions.
[4089.96 --> 4098.38]  But that which he demands, he first gives to us. And so we simply give back to him what he has
[4098.38 --> 4103.14]  given to us. And one of the ways we express that is through the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4103.14 --> 4107.32]  And so let's give with grateful hearts what God has already given to us.
[4107.80 --> 4111.28]  Our designated offering for this Sunday is Regent College.
[4113.26 --> 4118.98]  Here it is. Regent College is very much in many of our hearts.
[4119.34 --> 4124.56]  They have an amazing mission. They're doing great work. And so we continue to support them.
[4125.16 --> 4127.66]  And may I ask the deacons to come and collect our offering.
[4133.14 --> 4135.14]  Thank you.
[4135.14 --> 4136.14]  Thank you.
[4136.14 --> 4137.14]  Thank you.
[4137.14 --> 4138.14]  Thank you.
[4138.14 --> 4140.14]  Thank you.
[4140.14 --> 4142.14]  Thank you.
[4142.14 --> 4143.14]  Amen.
[4172.14 --> 4174.14]  Amen.
[4202.14 --> 4204.14]  Amen.
[4232.14 --> 4234.14]  Amen.
[4234.14 --> 4235.14]  Amen.
[4235.14 --> 4237.14]  Amen.
[4237.14 --> 4244.48]  So as we pray together today, we recognize that we join in a long line of believers throughout
[4244.48 --> 4251.90]  the generations who have called on God as their sustainer, their provider.
[4251.90 --> 4258.24]  So please join with me in this prayer we're going to use today is a historic prayer from
[4258.24 --> 4260.02]  the Book of Common Prayer.
[4260.02 --> 4265.12]  So we'll try to smooth out the language a little bit, but it'll be a little bit different.
[4265.12 --> 4266.70]  But let's pray it together.
[4266.70 --> 4270.46]  Please join me in prayer.
[4270.46 --> 4278.40]  God of peace, who has taught us that in returning and rest we shall be saved, in quietness and
[4278.40 --> 4281.74]  in confidence shall be our strength.
[4281.74 --> 4289.22]  By the might of your spirit, lift us, we pray, to your presence where we may be still and
[4289.22 --> 4291.72]  know that you are God.
[4291.72 --> 4299.20]  Heavenly Father, who has filled the world with beauty, open our eyes to behold your gracious
[4299.20 --> 4301.84]  hand in all your works.
[4301.84 --> 4306.84]  That rejoicing in your whole creation, we may learn to serve you with gladness.
[4306.84 --> 4314.94]  For the sake of him by whom all things were made, your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[4314.94 --> 4322.12]  And oh God, grant us in all our doubts and uncertainties the grace to ask what you would
[4322.12 --> 4324.62]  have us to do.
[4324.62 --> 4329.72]  that the spirit of wisdom may save us from all false choices.
[4329.72 --> 4333.56]  And that in your light we may see light.
[4333.56 --> 4339.60]  And in your straight path may not stumble.
[4339.60 --> 4344.28]  O God, the creator and preserver of all mankind.
[4344.28 --> 4351.32]  We pray to you for all people in our city, our country, and our world.
[4351.32 --> 4355.16]  That you would be pleased to make your ways known to them.
[4355.16 --> 4359.08]  Your saving health to all nations.
[4359.08 --> 4363.10]  More especially we pray for your holy church universal.
[4363.10 --> 4367.32]  That it may be so guided and governed by your good spirit.
[4367.32 --> 4373.72]  That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth.
[4373.72 --> 4376.52]  And hold the faith in unity of spirit.
[4376.52 --> 4378.52]  In the bond of peace.
[4378.52 --> 4382.52]  And in righteousness of life.
[4382.52 --> 4390.10]  Also we commend to you, to your fatherly goodness, all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed.
[4390.10 --> 4393.88]  In mind, body, or circumstance.
[4393.88 --> 4398.50]  We think especially of those present here today.
[4398.50 --> 4403.32]  We think especially, Lord, of those who are our loved ones.
[4403.32 --> 4408.54]  That it may please you to comfort and relieve them according to their needs.
[4408.54 --> 4412.16]  Giving them patience under their sufferings.
[4412.16 --> 4416.04]  And a blessed result out of all of their struggles.
[4416.04 --> 4418.78]  Merciful God, giver of life and health.
[4418.78 --> 4421.10]  Bless, we pray, your children.
[4421.10 --> 4424.00]  John Van Tull.
