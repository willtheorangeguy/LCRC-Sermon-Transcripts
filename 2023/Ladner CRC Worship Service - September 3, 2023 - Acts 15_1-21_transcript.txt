[335.48 --> 338.48]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[338.48 --> 339.48]  Good morning.
[339.48 --> 345.08]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church, and it is great to be worshiping the Lord with
[345.08 --> 347.08]  you again here.
[347.08 --> 351.80]  And especially if you are with us for the first time, if you're here checking us out, we are
[351.80 --> 356.92]  really glad that you are here, and we'd love to get to know you and welcome you.
[356.92 --> 364.02]  And I know this is a long weekend, so a lot of our regular friends are away, and we pray
[364.02 --> 368.12]  for the Lord's blessing and to be with them.
[368.12 --> 371.08]  And so, you know, we are Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[371.08 --> 377.38]  We are a family of believers that meet together here in Ladner.
[377.38 --> 382.58]  But we also recognize that we are actually part of the larger family of God.
[382.58 --> 387.28]  We are part of, you know, all of God's children who meet in the city of Vancouver, across our
[387.28 --> 390.90]  nation, and even all around the world.
[390.90 --> 395.70]  And that's really how we want to approach our life together here, that we are part of
[395.70 --> 398.06]  God's kingdom.
[398.06 --> 400.80]  We're part of the kingdom, but we're just a small part, right?
[400.80 --> 405.98]  We're just a small part of the glorious kingdom that God is building.
[405.98 --> 413.26]  And, you know, we're just one, we want to be one faithful piece of the larger puzzle.
[413.26 --> 418.44]  And I want to emphasize that because we have chosen to gather here as Ladner CRC.
[418.44 --> 424.30]  It doesn't mean that we see ourselves as better or superior to other churches or even to other
[424.30 --> 425.30]  denominations.
[425.30 --> 434.74]  And what matters is that we worship Jesus and we hold on to the life-changing message
[434.74 --> 437.44]  of the gospel.
[437.44 --> 445.50]  And so let us begin our worship this morning as we do each week with a call to worship.
[445.50 --> 449.54]  And the call to worship, this is God's own invitation to us.
[449.54 --> 454.82]  It's His own word to us to come each week to come in to worship Him and to actually be
[454.82 --> 457.42]  served by Him and to be loved by Him.
[457.42 --> 461.94]  And then as we seek to turn to Him in response.
[461.94 --> 466.42]  So would you join me as we respond to this invitation from Revelation 7?
[466.42 --> 472.06]  And the words will be on the screen here as we do that.
[472.06 --> 478.12]  After this I looked and there was, and there before me was a great multitude that no one
[478.12 --> 483.98]  could count from every nation, tribe, people, and language standing before the throne and
[483.98 --> 486.32]  before the Lamb.
[486.32 --> 490.72]  They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands and they cried
[490.72 --> 499.40]  out in a loud voice together, salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the
[499.40 --> 501.24]  Lamb.
[501.24 --> 507.28]  All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures.
[507.28 --> 514.14]  They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God saying, Amen.
[514.14 --> 523.56]  Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God forever
[523.56 --> 525.14]  and ever.
[525.14 --> 526.14]  Amen.
[526.14 --> 534.16]  Would you please join me as we pray this prayer of adoration and respond to who God is.
[534.16 --> 541.68]  Our Heavenly Father, Lord, you are God Almighty and we come before you this morning because
[541.68 --> 543.96]  you have called us to know you.
[543.96 --> 549.64]  And you have called us to rest in you, to be known by you.
[549.64 --> 552.22]  You have called us to trust you.
[552.22 --> 556.12]  To lay down our anxieties.
[556.12 --> 559.50]  To lay down our burdens at your feet.
[559.50 --> 564.84]  Because yours are the feet that walked upon the chaotic waters.
[564.84 --> 571.26]  Yours are the feet that were nailed to the cross for our salvation.
[571.26 --> 575.98]  And Lord, we join our hearts and our voices with all of your people throughout history,
[575.98 --> 582.94]  around the world and with those even now who are gathered before your throne in heaven, proclaiming
[582.94 --> 587.22]  that you, Jesus, are worthy of our praise and our devotion.
[587.22 --> 591.60]  And so, Lord, we come here this morning because we desire to acknowledge that.
[592.54 --> 597.04]  And we desire to acknowledge it not just with our lips and not even just with our hearts,
[597.04 --> 603.72]  but with our entire lives, with our proclamation of who you are, with our songs.
[603.72 --> 609.24]  And as we eagerly listen to your word being proclaimed, knowing that your word are words
[609.24 --> 610.54]  that lead to eternal life.
[611.22 --> 616.46]  And so, God, help us to enter into that space of worship this morning where we are ready to
[616.46 --> 623.68]  hear from you and that we are ready to respond to you and to meet you here because you are here
[623.68 --> 624.86]  with us.
[624.86 --> 627.46]  And we pray all of this in Jesus' name.
[628.12 --> 628.42]  Amen.
[629.32 --> 635.36]  So, friends, please stand as you are able in body or in spirit and hear God's greeting
[635.36 --> 638.78]  to us also from Revelation 7, verse 17 says this.
[639.12 --> 642.92]  For the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd.
[643.66 --> 649.92]  He will lead them to springs of living water and God will wipe away every tear from their
[649.92 --> 650.32]  eyes.
[651.04 --> 652.06]  Let's sing together.
[652.26 --> 653.24]  Let's sing praises to God.
[654.86 --> 680.82]  The splendor of the King,
[680.82 --> 690.82]  Loved in majesty, let all the earth rejoice, let all the earth rejoice.
[690.82 --> 706.58]  He wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide, and trembles at his voice, and trembles at his voice.
[706.58 --> 725.36]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will see how great, how great is our God.
[725.36 --> 741.36]  And makes to raise his hand, and time is in his hands, beginning at the end, beginning at the end.
[741.36 --> 756.36]  He rubbed free in one, Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
[756.36 --> 775.36]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will see how great, how great is our God.
[775.36 --> 794.36]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[794.36 --> 814.36]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[814.36 --> 824.36]  Name above all names, and love, and all will see how great, how great is our God.

[841.36 --> 853.10]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[853.10 --> 861.96]  And when I think that God is some not sparing
[861.96 --> 871.80]  Sent him to die, I scarced and take it in
[871.80 --> 880.88]  That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
[880.88 --> 890.12]  He bled and died to take away my sin
[890.12 --> 899.62]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[899.62 --> 910.18]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[910.18 --> 918.42]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[918.42 --> 930.96]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[930.96 --> 956.32]  Wonderful, so wonderful
[956.32 --> 960.72]  Is your unfilling love
[960.72 --> 967.32]  Your cross has spoken mercy over me
[967.32 --> 973.78]  No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[973.78 --> 977.38]  No heart that fully know
[977.38 --> 984.38]  How glorious, how beautiful you are
[984.38 --> 989.52]  Beautiful what I love
[989.52 --> 993.76]  Beautiful what I adore
[993.76 --> 1001.50]  Beautiful what my soul must sing
[1001.50 --> 1006.50]  Powerful, so powerful
[1006.50 --> 1010.82]  Your glory fills the skies
[1010.82 --> 1017.04]  Your mighty earth's displayed for all to see
[1017.04 --> 1023.08]  The beauty of your majesty
[1023.08 --> 1024.08]  Awakes my heart to sing
[1024.08 --> 1028.08]  Awakes my heart to sing
[1028.08 --> 1034.08]  How marvelous, how wonderful you are
[1034.08 --> 1039.62]  Beautiful what I love
[1039.62 --> 1044.08]  Beautiful what I adore
[1044.08 --> 1046.08]  Beautiful what I adore
[1046.08 --> 1049.48]  Beautiful what I love
[1049.48 --> 1051.02]  Beautiful what I adore
[1051.02 --> 1052.16]  Beautiful what I adore
[1052.16 --> 1053.42]  Beautiful what I send
[1053.42 --> 1053.66]  Beautiful what I adore
[1053.66 --> 1054.26]  Beautiful what I adore
[1054.26 --> 1054.80]  Beautiful what I love
[1054.80 --> 1056.92]  You opened my eyes to your wonders anew
[1056.92 --> 1057.36]  You captured my heart with this love
[1057.36 --> 1061.70]  You captured my heart with this love
[1061.70 --> 1067.28]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you.
[1069.60 --> 1074.26]  You opened my eyes to your wonders of view.
[1074.26 --> 1078.40]  You captured my heart with this love.
[1078.80 --> 1084.50]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you.
[1084.50 --> 1090.50]  Beautiful one I love.
[1090.70 --> 1094.72]  Beautiful one I adore.
[1094.72 --> 1102.20]  Beautiful one my soul must sing.
[1103.20 --> 1107.54]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1108.08 --> 1111.80]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1111.80 --> 1115.68]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1116.14 --> 1118.14]  Beautiful one.
[1120.36 --> 1124.24]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1124.80 --> 1128.18]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1128.68 --> 1132.24]  My soul, my soul must sing.
[1132.60 --> 1134.48]  Beautiful one.
[1134.48 --> 1145.66]  You may be seated.
[1149.24 --> 1152.96]  So we come now to a time of confession.
[1152.96 --> 1162.26]  And before we do that, I want to read together a bit of our CRC contemporary testimony.
[1162.26 --> 1165.02]  It's called Our World Belongs to God.
[1165.62 --> 1167.88]  And there is a series of statements.
[1167.88 --> 1170.36]  And I want to read number 41.
[1170.58 --> 1175.04]  And it is about our mission as the church in the world.
[1175.46 --> 1176.80]  It's beautifully written.
[1176.80 --> 1183.66]  And as we'll see later, what we're looking at in our passage today is about God's mission.
[1183.80 --> 1187.94]  And about people from all the nations coming to become part of the church.
[1187.94 --> 1190.68]  So let me read this for us.
[1190.72 --> 1194.00]  And that will lead us into our time of confession today.
[1196.00 --> 1197.38]  So here's what it says.
[1197.80 --> 1206.18]  Joining the mission of God, the church is sent with the gospel of the kingdom to call everyone to know and follow Christ.
[1206.18 --> 1216.46]  And to proclaim to all the assurance that in the name of Jesus there is forgiveness of sin and new life for all who repent and believe.
[1217.34 --> 1224.68]  The Spirit calls all members to embrace God's mission in their neighborhoods and in the world.
[1225.10 --> 1226.26]  To feed the hungry.
[1226.94 --> 1228.38]  Bring water to the thirsty.
[1229.10 --> 1230.16]  Welcome the stranger.
[1230.54 --> 1231.42]  Clothe the naked.
[1231.72 --> 1232.54]  Care for the sick.
[1232.64 --> 1233.60]  And free the prisoner.
[1233.60 --> 1238.92]  We repent of leaving this work to a few.
[1239.42 --> 1243.68]  For this mission is central to our being.
[1246.96 --> 1249.14]  You know, isn't that good?
[1249.72 --> 1258.12]  It's so well written and it so well encapsulates what it is that we are to be about, which is God's mission in the world.
[1258.12 --> 1263.58]  But notice right at the end there that there is a confession.
[1264.30 --> 1266.22]  That this is what God is doing.
[1266.46 --> 1274.40]  And yet, as God's people, you know, sometimes we fail to realize and to live into this mission that God is doing.
[1274.40 --> 1282.38]  And so, and it says we repent of leaving this work to a few for the mission is central to our being.
[1283.14 --> 1287.90]  And so today I want to invite us to use this as our confession today.
[1287.90 --> 1291.28]  Because so often we fail to live into the mission that God has called us to.
[1291.28 --> 1294.88]  And so let's confess again.
[1295.02 --> 1298.02]  And when we talk about confession, it's just, you know, we had a call to worship.
[1298.14 --> 1299.50]  And each week we have a call to worship.
[1299.78 --> 1302.80]  And each week we also confess our sins.
[1302.86 --> 1304.96]  And we want to be a people who respond to God.
[1305.14 --> 1309.06]  And we want to learn to be a people who confess our sins and to look to God for his grace.
[1309.18 --> 1312.34]  And so we'll pray this confession corporately together.
[1312.70 --> 1315.66]  And then I'll give us a time for personal confession.
[1316.22 --> 1316.40]  Okay.
[1316.40 --> 1319.62]  So let's say this prayer of confession together.
[1320.58 --> 1325.54]  Almighty God, we confess how hard it is to be your people.
[1326.18 --> 1334.76]  You have called us to be the church, to continue the mission of Jesus Christ to our lonely and confused world.
[1335.00 --> 1344.92]  Yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active, isolated than involved, callous than compassionate,
[1344.92 --> 1349.94]  obstinate than obedient, legalistic than loving.
[1350.80 --> 1355.70]  Gracious Lord, have mercy upon us and forgive our sins.
[1356.32 --> 1362.72]  Remove the obstacles preventing us from being your representatives to a broken world.
[1363.44 --> 1368.16]  Awaken our hearts to the promised gift of your indwelling spirit.
[1368.96 --> 1372.12]  This we pray in Jesus' powerful name.
[1372.76 --> 1373.12]  Amen.
[1374.92 --> 1383.64]  So let's take a moment now of silent confession, of personal confession, to ask God for his forgiveness in our own lives
[1383.64 --> 1386.76]  and for his healing and for his renewal by the Holy Spirit.
[1386.76 --> 1386.88]  Amen.
[1390.88 --> 1391.72]  Amen.
[1393.04 --> 1393.68]  Amen.
[1398.30 --> 1398.66]  Amen.
[1398.66 --> 1404.74]  Amen.
[1404.74 --> 1415.56]  Triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit,
[1416.10 --> 1420.56]  you are ascending God.
[1420.68 --> 1422.02]  You are a missionary God.
[1422.70 --> 1425.10]  You are the God who has come to us.
[1425.88 --> 1429.38]  You sent Jesus to come and to rescue us
[1429.38 --> 1433.30]  because we are a people who need rescue.
[1433.30 --> 1441.14]  We are a people who are so often snared by our sin.
[1442.08 --> 1444.20]  Rather than loving you, we love ourselves
[1444.20 --> 1445.92]  or other things in place of you.
[1446.92 --> 1450.24]  And Lord, you came to us because we do need you.
[1451.12 --> 1453.00]  Lord, each one of us, we have come here
[1453.00 --> 1457.92]  with various bruises and brokenness.
[1458.98 --> 1462.08]  And Lord, we thank you that your mission is to us,
[1462.08 --> 1465.64]  that we are recipients of your grace.
[1466.50 --> 1469.64]  And Lord, we thank you for not only healing us,
[1469.70 --> 1472.14]  but lifting up our hearts and calling us
[1472.14 --> 1476.68]  to the grand vision, the grand mission
[1476.68 --> 1478.56]  that you are doing.
[1479.12 --> 1481.36]  And Lord, you call us to follow you.
[1481.44 --> 1483.88]  You call us to be on mission with you.
[1483.94 --> 1486.94]  And Lord, we also don't do that in our own strength,
[1486.94 --> 1490.18]  but we rely on your power at work within us.
[1490.46 --> 1492.20]  And so Lord, would you make us individually,
[1492.36 --> 1493.66]  would you make us as a church,
[1493.78 --> 1496.04]  instruments of your peace
[1496.04 --> 1499.00]  and of the word of your grace
[1499.00 --> 1501.90]  as we've read to a confused world.
[1502.34 --> 1504.26]  And we pray in Jesus' name.
[1504.84 --> 1505.16]  Amen.
[1505.16 --> 1508.94]  So brothers and sisters,
[1509.08 --> 1510.16]  lift up your heads now
[1510.16 --> 1512.54]  to receive this assurance of pardon and grace.
[1513.98 --> 1517.06]  In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,
[1517.26 --> 1520.02]  we are assured that there is no sin
[1520.02 --> 1522.28]  so terrible that God cannot forgive,
[1523.00 --> 1526.32]  no hurt so terrible that God cannot heal.
[1527.04 --> 1531.18]  God accepts, God forgives, and God sets free.
[1531.18 --> 1533.78]  Receive the forgiving love of God.
[1534.74 --> 1536.00]  Thanks be to God.
[1536.30 --> 1539.42]  So let's stand together and respond to this good news.
[1539.90 --> 1541.52]  And let's sing together.
[1541.96 --> 1542.58]  Please stand.
[1542.58 --> 1542.64]  Amen.
[1553.64 --> 1559.40]  Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice
[1559.40 --> 1561.80]  You became nothing
[1561.80 --> 1562.00]  You became nothing
[1562.00 --> 1564.68]  Born out to death
[1564.68 --> 1567.14]  Many times
[1567.14 --> 1570.36]  I wondered at your gift of life
[1570.36 --> 1574.18]  I'm in that place once again
[1574.18 --> 1579.96]  I'm in that place once again
[1579.96 --> 1586.30]  Once again I looked upon the cross where you died
[1586.30 --> 1591.96]  I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside
[1591.96 --> 1595.00]  Once again I thank you
[1595.00 --> 1600.30]  Once again I pour out my life
[1600.30 --> 1609.22]  Now you are exalted to the highest place
[1609.22 --> 1611.50]  King of the heavens
[1611.50 --> 1614.10]  Where one day I'll bow
[1614.10 --> 1614.58]  Where one day I'll bow
[1614.58 --> 1616.98]  But for now
[1616.98 --> 1620.28]  I marvel at this saving grace
[1620.28 --> 1623.90]  And I'm full of praise once again
[1623.90 --> 1629.32]  I'm full of praise once again
[1629.32 --> 1636.26]  Once again I looked upon the cross where you died
[1636.26 --> 1641.84]  I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside
[1641.84 --> 1644.92]  Once again I thank you
[1644.92 --> 1650.10]  Once again I pour out my life
[1650.10 --> 1655.88]  Thank you for the cross
[1655.88 --> 1658.10]  Thank you for the cross
[1658.10 --> 1662.00]  Thank you my friend
[1665.96 --> 1667.30]  Thank you for the cross
[1667.30 --> 1668.70]  Thank you for the cross
[1668.70 --> 1677.88]  Thank you for the cross
[1677.88 --> 1681.28]  I look upon the cross where you died.
[1681.76 --> 1686.50]  I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside.
[1687.74 --> 1690.16]  Once again I thank you.
[1690.16 --> 1695.16]  Once again I pour out my life.
[1707.88 --> 1718.56]  So at this time our children who are on the younger side, age three to grade one, may go to their class.
[1718.56 --> 1722.66]  And this is the last time of the summer that we'll have our one combined class.
[1722.74 --> 1727.26]  And starting next Sunday we will be kicking off with two classes.
[1727.86 --> 1728.90]  Come from one to two.
[1729.52 --> 1731.20]  And so that begins next week.
[1731.84 --> 1736.00]  Let us prepare for the reading of God's word.
[1737.88 --> 1751.88]  Let us prepare for the reading of God's word.
[1751.88 --> 1754.54]  Act 15, 1 to 21.
[1755.24 --> 1760.86]  Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers.
[1761.56 --> 1766.88]  Unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by Moses,
[1766.88 --> 1769.04]  you cannot be saved.
[1770.08 --> 1774.72]  This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them.
[1775.36 --> 1780.88]  So Paul and Barnabas were appointed among with some other believers
[1780.88 --> 1786.98]  to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
[1786.98 --> 1794.04]  The church sent them on their way and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria,
[1794.66 --> 1798.50]  they told how the Gentiles had done being converted.
[1799.46 --> 1802.28]  This news made all the believers very glad.
[1803.14 --> 1808.74]  When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders
[1808.74 --> 1834.10]  met to consider this question.
[1834.10 --> 1839.96]  After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them.
[1840.42 --> 1848.44]  Brothers, you know that some time ago, God made a choice among you that the Gentiles
[1848.44 --> 1853.90]  made hear from you, from my lips, the message of the gospel and belief.
[1853.90 --> 1863.32]  God, who knows, the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them,
[1863.72 --> 1865.62]  just as he did to us.
[1866.74 --> 1874.00]  He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
[1874.00 --> 1885.80]  Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the next Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?
[1886.32 --> 1894.86]  No, we believe it's through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved just as they are.
[1894.86 --> 1908.08]  The whole assembly came silent and they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
[1908.82 --> 1911.60]  When they finished, James spoke up.
[1911.60 --> 1914.58]  Brothers, he said, listen to me.
[1915.14 --> 1925.68]  Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.
[1926.22 --> 1931.54]  The words of the prophets are in agreement with this as it's written.
[1931.54 --> 1938.02]  After this, I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent.
[1938.70 --> 1942.68]  Its ruins I will rebuild and I will restore it,
[1943.36 --> 1947.44]  that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
[1947.90 --> 1953.00]  even all the Gentiles who bear my name.
[1954.32 --> 1957.38]  Says the Lord, who does these things?
[1958.00 --> 1960.80]  Things known from long ago.
[1960.80 --> 1962.46]  It's my judgment.
[1964.14 --> 1965.80]  It's my judgment.
[1966.34 --> 1972.92]  Therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
[1973.36 --> 1980.98]  Instead, we should read to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols,
[1981.46 --> 1988.80]  from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
[1988.80 --> 1995.46]  For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times,
[1995.96 --> 2000.36]  and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.
[2000.36 --> 2016.62]  Thank you, Violet.
[2016.62 --> 2019.80]  That was a long passage, so you did great.
[2020.96 --> 2022.30]  So good morning to you all.
[2023.06 --> 2024.26]  And it's nice to be with you again.
[2024.34 --> 2027.24]  As many of you will know, I've been away for four weeks on holidays,
[2027.24 --> 2033.42]  and so I want to thank you for giving my family and I that time to rest, recuperate.
[2033.42 --> 2039.92]  We had a nice time with our families from the East Coast coming to visit us.
[2040.18 --> 2041.54]  And so, yeah, thank you.
[2041.78 --> 2042.40]  Glad to be back.
[2043.32 --> 2047.86]  So now what I want to do, you know, we've had guest preachers over the last four weeks,
[2048.08 --> 2052.30]  and what I want to do from this Sunday, then leading all the way up to Advent,
[2052.30 --> 2056.82]  so in the fall, is to continue our series in the Book of Acts.
[2058.38 --> 2064.56]  And one of the things we've been saying is that the Book of Acts is really the primary historical document
[2064.56 --> 2070.60]  that we have that shows us not only the beginning of Christianity, like how this all began,
[2071.52 --> 2076.26]  but also how the gospel then went out and it spread from Jerusalem,
[2076.86 --> 2079.98]  and it spread throughout the entire Roman Empire.
[2079.98 --> 2087.58]  And we see all of these different peoples as the gospel goes out and people from all the nations hear the gospel,
[2088.46 --> 2091.70]  all these different people from different cultures and walks of life,
[2091.98 --> 2100.14]  they joyfully and they freely come into the faith, they believe in Jesus, and they become part of the church.
[2101.16 --> 2106.56]  So now this morning, we're looking at a passage that Violet read for us
[2106.56 --> 2117.40]  that actually tells us what happens when this early fledgling baby church encounters its first major internal crisis and conflict.
[2117.86 --> 2121.48]  And one of the things we're going to see is that this conflict is actually so serious
[2121.48 --> 2128.22]  that had it not been handled well, it would very likely have split the church
[2128.22 --> 2133.72]  and completely undermined and hijacked the church's mission in the world.
[2134.68 --> 2136.96]  So that's what this passage is about.
[2137.46 --> 2141.22]  Let me pray for us as we begin to look into it, and then we'll get into it.
[2141.24 --> 2141.94]  So let's pray together.
[2141.94 --> 2148.88]  Father, Father, your word itself testifies that it is the living word,
[2149.68 --> 2156.06]  that it not only inspires and informs us, but ultimately that it renews us.
[2157.22 --> 2163.18]  And so, Holy Spirit, we pray that you would speak to our own hearts and our own lives this morning.
[2163.62 --> 2165.72]  Speak to us as well as a congregation,
[2165.72 --> 2170.02]  that your word would be our hope,
[2170.60 --> 2173.70]  it would be our wisdom, and our joy.
[2174.52 --> 2176.82]  And we pray all of this in your Son's name.
[2177.18 --> 2177.46]  Amen.
[2179.50 --> 2182.62]  So as we begin to look at Acts 15 together this morning,
[2182.62 --> 2186.64]  I want to begin by asking you, inviting you,
[2187.24 --> 2189.22]  to imagine something with me.
[2189.92 --> 2195.08]  So I want you to imagine a visitor from another planet.
[2195.72 --> 2198.78]  In other words, an alien, but maybe that's not very sensitive to him.
[2198.98 --> 2200.86]  So it's a visitor from another planet.
[2201.52 --> 2204.00]  And this space visitor is a scholar,
[2204.56 --> 2209.14]  a researcher who studies the religions of other planets.
[2209.70 --> 2211.88]  And our friend, the space scholar,
[2212.16 --> 2217.58]  he wants to do a field study of the Earth religion called Christianity.
[2218.46 --> 2219.36]  He's going to study that.
[2219.38 --> 2220.14]  What is this all about?
[2220.88 --> 2224.52]  So the way he's going to do this study is he's going to visit Earth,
[2224.52 --> 2228.14]  and he's going to observe the practices, the beliefs,
[2228.20 --> 2232.82]  and the major concerns of representative samples of Christians
[2232.82 --> 2235.32]  across the centuries and around the world.
[2236.26 --> 2238.64]  And by doing this, he's going to discover what is Christianity.
[2239.98 --> 2244.72]  So his first visit to Earth is to a church gathering
[2244.72 --> 2250.60]  of the original Jerusalem Christians in the year 37 AD,
[2250.80 --> 2252.82]  right after Jesus has ascended to heaven.
[2252.82 --> 2259.12]  He notices in this church gathering in Jerusalem that they are all Jews.
[2260.06 --> 2263.16]  Indeed, they often gather in the temple for worship.
[2264.12 --> 2266.96]  And they also enjoy meals in each other's homes,
[2267.04 --> 2270.86]  and they have large families, and they circumcise their male children.
[2271.50 --> 2275.10]  They carefully follow detailed ceremonies and rituals,
[2275.10 --> 2279.54]  and they delight in reading of the Old Testament laws.
[2280.56 --> 2283.68]  In fact, they look just like other Jews.
[2284.18 --> 2289.66]  The only noticeable difference is that they believe in this man named Jesus of Nazareth.
[2290.16 --> 2291.62]  They believe that he is the Messiah.
[2292.90 --> 2298.36]  So our space visitor is pleased that he has discovered many interesting facts about Christianity,
[2298.36 --> 2300.70]  and he returns to his home planet.
[2301.80 --> 2306.56]  Now, four centuries later, around the year 430 AD,
[2307.26 --> 2314.82]  he returns to Earth and finds a group of monks gathered on a rocky coastline in Ireland.
[2316.02 --> 2320.22]  Several of these monks are standing in ice-cold water up to their necks,
[2320.22 --> 2322.16]  reciting the Psalms.
[2322.84 --> 2328.10]  Others are sitting alone in dark caves by the seashore, praying.
[2329.30 --> 2333.00]  While others are going off in small boats in doubtful-looking weather
[2333.00 --> 2335.86]  with a box full of beautiful manuscripts.
[2336.78 --> 2340.96]  And our space scholar, he realizes that these are the same holy writings
[2340.96 --> 2343.52]  that the Jerusalem Christians used,
[2343.88 --> 2346.62]  plus an additional collection called the New Testament.
[2346.62 --> 2349.06]  And they're taking these holy writings,
[2349.38 --> 2352.14]  and they want to share them with the people on neighboring islands.
[2353.16 --> 2357.82]  And they're calling everyone they meet to give up their worship of pagan gods,
[2358.28 --> 2362.78]  and instead to find joy in the promise of a future heavenly kingdom.
[2364.02 --> 2368.26]  Our space visitor also notes their desire for holy living.
[2368.26 --> 2374.92]  And as he thinks about the Jewish Christians in the temple nearly four centuries ago,
[2375.06 --> 2378.50]  he wonders if this is the same religion.
[2380.36 --> 2385.78]  Now, our space visitor, he delays his next visit until the 1840s,
[2386.42 --> 2387.78]  over a thousand years later.
[2388.38 --> 2390.16]  And he comes to London, England,
[2390.16 --> 2392.72]  and he finds in Exeter Hall,
[2393.66 --> 2395.82]  a large and excited assembly,
[2396.38 --> 2400.38]  hearing speeches about their desire to take the gospel to Africa.
[2401.30 --> 2404.56]  They are proposing to send missionaries to preach the gospel,
[2404.92 --> 2406.04]  to start new churches,
[2406.04 --> 2409.96]  but also to build hospitals and orphanages and schools.
[2410.90 --> 2414.50]  They're also in debates with the British government to abolish the slave trade.
[2414.50 --> 2421.52]  The meeting began with a reading from the same book in English translation
[2421.52 --> 2425.82]  that the earlier Irish and Jerusalem Christians also used.
[2426.50 --> 2429.64]  And indeed, it looks like everyone is carrying one of these books around with them.
[2430.74 --> 2432.28]  They also talk about Jesus,
[2432.94 --> 2434.80]  and the importance of personal faith in him.
[2436.18 --> 2439.94]  Like the Irish, they also desire to live holy lives.
[2440.72 --> 2442.82]  But they would think it completely ridiculous
[2442.82 --> 2446.94]  that holiness could be connected with standing in ice-cold water
[2446.94 --> 2449.32]  or praying in a cave.
[2450.74 --> 2454.36]  What the space visitor notices is their activism
[2454.36 --> 2458.64]  and how they want to involve their beliefs in all of their life and all of society.
[2460.96 --> 2465.80]  So our space visitor decides that he's going to make one final visit to Earth.
[2466.50 --> 2468.78]  He returns to Earth in 1990.
[2470.00 --> 2472.70]  He comes to the country of Nigeria in Africa.
[2472.82 --> 2477.30]  A group of women and men in white robes are dancing and chanting
[2477.30 --> 2479.80]  through the streets on their way to church.
[2480.74 --> 2484.26]  They are inviting people to come to experience the power of God
[2484.26 --> 2485.92]  in their worship service.
[2486.52 --> 2488.00]  They read from the same book.
[2488.24 --> 2489.50]  They pray to the same Jesus.
[2490.58 --> 2492.14]  They are not politically active,
[2492.74 --> 2494.74]  and their way of life is quite foreign
[2494.74 --> 2500.48]  to that of the British and the Irish before and the Jerusalem Christians.
[2501.28 --> 2505.38]  But what the scholar notices most is their emphasis on the Holy Spirit for healing.
[2505.38 --> 2508.62]  Now back on his home planet,
[2509.28 --> 2510.94]  our friend, the space scholar,
[2511.60 --> 2513.54]  has to summarize his research,
[2513.78 --> 2518.24]  and he has to present his findings to the Society of Interplanetary Religion.
[2518.24 --> 2522.00]  But he's a little bit nervous
[2522.00 --> 2527.28]  because he doesn't know what to make of this Earth religion called Christianity.
[2528.08 --> 2530.46]  Each of these different representative groups of people,
[2530.60 --> 2532.02]  they all claim to be Christians,
[2532.50 --> 2533.98]  but as far as he can tell,
[2534.30 --> 2536.40]  they are completely different from one another
[2536.40 --> 2537.60]  in their language,
[2537.86 --> 2538.90]  their way of life,
[2539.16 --> 2541.82]  and their major concerns and practices of Christianity.
[2541.82 --> 2546.66]  He begins to doubt if they can really all be called Christians at all.
[2548.18 --> 2550.56]  But then, as he's pondering this,
[2550.76 --> 2554.94]  he begins to see how these different pieces of the puzzle come together.
[2556.96 --> 2559.12]  He notices that on the one hand,
[2559.20 --> 2562.34]  these wildly different groups of Christians are in many ways,
[2563.22 --> 2566.96]  they're not actually so different from their surrounding societies and cultures.
[2567.72 --> 2571.46]  They each very much belong to their own time
[2571.46 --> 2573.16]  and place in history.
[2574.18 --> 2575.80]  And so our space scholar discovers
[2575.80 --> 2578.44]  that Christianity can make itself at home
[2578.44 --> 2581.92]  in all of these different times and cultures of the world.
[2582.96 --> 2583.86]  And yet,
[2584.66 --> 2586.74]  what all of these Christians share
[2586.74 --> 2590.12]  is a fundamental unity with one another
[2590.12 --> 2591.74]  through faith in Jesus Christ.
[2592.48 --> 2592.70]  Right?
[2592.76 --> 2594.40]  They all worship Jesus as Lord.
[2595.00 --> 2596.48]  They all read the Bible
[2596.48 --> 2599.98]  as the guide to faith and life.
[2599.98 --> 2602.62]  And they all desire to love God
[2602.62 --> 2603.90]  and to love their neighbor
[2603.90 --> 2606.30]  in ways that they know best.
[2607.76 --> 2608.66]  And so our space scholar,
[2608.82 --> 2609.42]  he says,
[2609.54 --> 2610.22]  I've got it.
[2610.60 --> 2612.46]  And he's excited to discover
[2612.46 --> 2614.52]  the true essence of Christianity.
[2615.14 --> 2616.16]  He tells everyone
[2616.16 --> 2617.58]  about what he has discovered
[2617.58 --> 2618.34]  about Christianity.
[2618.72 --> 2621.04]  That Christians are all followers of Jesus.
[2621.92 --> 2623.08]  And you can find Christians
[2623.08 --> 2624.08]  all around the world
[2624.08 --> 2625.16]  and throughout the centuries.
[2625.16 --> 2626.78]  And these Christians,
[2626.88 --> 2627.60]  they see themselves
[2627.60 --> 2629.96]  not only in communion with one another,
[2630.60 --> 2632.22]  despite all of their differences,
[2632.40 --> 2634.04]  but also in continuity
[2634.04 --> 2636.38]  with that first church in Jerusalem.
[2637.44 --> 2638.34]  And friends,
[2638.68 --> 2639.62]  this is amazing.
[2640.58 --> 2640.72]  Right?
[2640.82 --> 2641.50]  And you know what?
[2641.68 --> 2642.00]  Also,
[2642.26 --> 2643.64]  this is a true story.
[2644.36 --> 2644.48]  Right?
[2644.54 --> 2646.44]  Not the part about
[2646.44 --> 2647.26]  the alien,
[2647.54 --> 2647.96]  the, sorry,
[2648.62 --> 2650.36]  the space visitor.
[2650.36 --> 2650.44]  Here,
[2651.22 --> 2652.28]  he's entirely made up.
[2652.74 --> 2654.38]  But the story that I told you
[2654.38 --> 2657.30]  is a very condensed journey
[2657.30 --> 2658.50]  through church history.
[2659.38 --> 2660.50]  And this is true.
[2660.66 --> 2661.80]  This has unfolded
[2661.80 --> 2662.58]  the way it has
[2662.58 --> 2664.96]  because of what happened
[2664.96 --> 2666.22]  and because of the decisions
[2666.22 --> 2667.24]  that were made
[2667.24 --> 2669.50]  in our passage this morning
[2669.50 --> 2670.90]  in Acts 15
[2670.90 --> 2672.18]  at what is known
[2672.18 --> 2673.84]  as the Jerusalem Council.
[2674.90 --> 2676.70]  So here is a bit of the background
[2676.70 --> 2677.64]  to what's going on.
[2678.20 --> 2678.62]  Remember,
[2679.54 --> 2680.56]  Paul and Barnabas,
[2680.64 --> 2681.70]  they had been sent out
[2681.70 --> 2682.76]  to preach the gospel
[2682.76 --> 2683.98]  to the Gentiles.
[2684.12 --> 2685.26]  And so before my vacation
[2685.26 --> 2686.16]  over the last like
[2686.16 --> 2687.08]  six or seven weeks,
[2687.40 --> 2688.70]  we looked at what is called
[2688.70 --> 2689.92]  Paul and Barnabas'
[2691.76 --> 2693.40]  first missionary journey.
[2693.74 --> 2693.86]  Right?
[2693.92 --> 2695.62]  They went from Antioch in Syria
[2695.62 --> 2696.46]  on the coast,
[2697.22 --> 2698.22]  north of Israel,
[2698.44 --> 2700.02]  and they went to the island of Cyprus.
[2700.16 --> 2701.04]  Then they went up
[2701.04 --> 2702.60]  into the province of Galatia
[2702.60 --> 2703.32]  and they visited
[2703.32 --> 2704.62]  all kinds of different cities.
[2705.62 --> 2706.80]  And when the Gentiles,
[2706.94 --> 2707.60]  who they were preaching
[2707.60 --> 2707.88]  to,
[2708.10 --> 2709.52]  came to faith in Christ,
[2710.48 --> 2712.28]  they did not adopt
[2712.28 --> 2713.16]  Jewish customs.
[2714.60 --> 2715.22]  Why not?
[2715.86 --> 2717.88]  Because Paul didn't tell them to.
[2719.02 --> 2719.56]  But then,
[2719.64 --> 2720.60]  now some people
[2720.60 --> 2722.32]  went to the Gentiles,
[2722.88 --> 2723.92]  the Gentile Christians,
[2724.06 --> 2724.46]  and they said,
[2724.56 --> 2724.84]  look,
[2725.24 --> 2726.46]  if you want to become
[2726.46 --> 2727.10]  a Christian,
[2727.54 --> 2729.00]  you need to become
[2729.00 --> 2730.90]  culturally Jewish.
[2732.16 --> 2733.66]  And that is why
[2733.66 --> 2734.54]  they're having
[2734.54 --> 2736.26]  this big theological,
[2736.96 --> 2737.48]  cultural,
[2738.02 --> 2738.50]  ethical,
[2738.92 --> 2740.02]  missional debate
[2740.02 --> 2741.00]  that is happening.
[2741.22 --> 2742.64]  This is a big debate.
[2742.72 --> 2743.44]  This is a big issue.
[2744.04 --> 2745.02]  The main issue
[2745.02 --> 2745.62]  of the debate
[2745.62 --> 2746.88]  is not whether
[2746.88 --> 2748.06]  Gentiles can be
[2748.06 --> 2750.06]  part of the people of God.
[2750.94 --> 2752.06]  That has been settled.
[2752.16 --> 2753.32]  The Gentiles have already
[2753.32 --> 2754.44]  been becoming
[2754.44 --> 2755.22]  part of the church.
[2755.48 --> 2756.14]  The question,
[2756.26 --> 2756.48]  rather,
[2756.60 --> 2757.06]  is,
[2757.40 --> 2758.54]  should the Gentiles
[2758.54 --> 2759.26]  be required
[2759.26 --> 2760.56]  to be circumcised
[2760.56 --> 2761.54]  and to keep
[2761.54 --> 2762.32]  the Mosaic Law?
[2762.92 --> 2763.62]  In other words,
[2763.74 --> 2764.62]  to become part
[2764.62 --> 2765.48]  of the people of God,
[2765.66 --> 2767.16]  do you have to become
[2767.16 --> 2769.20]  culturally Jewish?
[2770.66 --> 2771.82]  Now imagine if
[2771.82 --> 2773.08]  the answer was yes.
[2774.30 --> 2775.10]  We wouldn't have,
[2775.20 --> 2776.18]  we wouldn't be sitting here,
[2776.24 --> 2776.44]  maybe,
[2776.52 --> 2777.08]  we would all be
[2777.08 --> 2778.08]  looking culturally Jewish
[2778.08 --> 2778.86]  and speaking Hebrew,
[2779.12 --> 2780.24]  and we would all be Christians,
[2780.36 --> 2781.36]  and we'd all around the world
[2781.36 --> 2781.98]  be the same.
[2782.22 --> 2782.90]  But that's not what
[2782.90 --> 2783.74]  they decided, is it?
[2783.80 --> 2784.44]  Because here we are.
[2785.22 --> 2785.98]  So what I want to do
[2785.98 --> 2786.50]  this morning,
[2787.06 --> 2787.84]  so I want us to look
[2787.84 --> 2788.54]  very briefly,
[2789.02 --> 2789.38]  because that was
[2789.38 --> 2790.16]  a very long introduction,
[2790.56 --> 2791.66]  briefly,
[2791.84 --> 2793.18]  at two decisions
[2793.18 --> 2794.62]  that were made,
[2795.70 --> 2796.40]  and decisions
[2796.40 --> 2797.70]  that made it possible
[2797.70 --> 2799.46]  for anyone everywhere
[2799.46 --> 2801.36]  to become a Christian
[2801.36 --> 2802.16]  and become part
[2802.16 --> 2802.90]  of the people of God
[2802.90 --> 2803.94]  as they are.
[2805.44 --> 2805.78]  So,
[2806.36 --> 2807.60]  to the two decisions
[2807.60 --> 2808.28]  that were made
[2808.28 --> 2809.52]  that were so significant
[2809.52 --> 2810.26]  are first,
[2810.42 --> 2810.66]  one,
[2810.98 --> 2811.96]  they decide that
[2811.96 --> 2813.18]  they had to
[2813.18 --> 2814.42]  reconceive
[2814.42 --> 2815.16]  of their identity.
[2816.30 --> 2816.84]  And second,
[2817.58 --> 2818.26]  they decided
[2818.26 --> 2819.46]  that they needed
[2819.46 --> 2820.46]  to practice love.
[2821.28 --> 2821.44]  Okay,
[2821.46 --> 2821.96]  they decided
[2821.96 --> 2822.80]  to reconceive
[2822.80 --> 2823.44]  their identity
[2823.44 --> 2824.94]  and to practice love.
[2825.42 --> 2825.82]  And that's what
[2825.82 --> 2826.66]  I want us to see here.
[2827.08 --> 2827.48]  So first,
[2827.58 --> 2828.66]  reconceiving their identity.
[2829.36 --> 2830.14]  The church
[2830.14 --> 2830.72]  in Jerusalem
[2830.72 --> 2831.58]  made the decision
[2831.58 --> 2832.36]  that they had
[2832.36 --> 2833.62]  to reconceive
[2833.62 --> 2834.98]  of who they are.
[2835.24 --> 2836.30]  What is the identity
[2836.30 --> 2837.00]  of the church?
[2838.50 --> 2838.98]  Now,
[2839.06 --> 2839.60]  when we're talking
[2839.60 --> 2840.24]  about identity,
[2840.34 --> 2840.84]  I know that's kind
[2840.84 --> 2842.08]  of an abstract word,
[2842.78 --> 2843.70]  what we're talking
[2843.70 --> 2844.54]  about is this.
[2844.66 --> 2845.30]  We're talking about
[2845.30 --> 2845.76]  things like
[2845.76 --> 2847.22]  who we are.
[2848.24 --> 2849.28]  How we got
[2849.28 --> 2850.58]  to be who we are
[2850.58 --> 2852.40]  and who has the right
[2852.40 --> 2853.52]  to change that.
[2854.74 --> 2855.78]  That is what's going
[2855.78 --> 2856.46]  on this struggle
[2856.46 --> 2857.42]  about the identity
[2857.42 --> 2858.06]  of the church.
[2858.48 --> 2859.44]  And that's what
[2859.44 --> 2860.10]  this conflict,
[2860.22 --> 2860.80]  what this debate
[2860.80 --> 2861.86]  is in part about.
[2862.72 --> 2863.96]  So here's what's
[2863.96 --> 2864.80]  going on here.
[2865.16 --> 2865.42]  Now,
[2865.54 --> 2866.64]  the church began
[2866.64 --> 2867.56]  in Jerusalem,
[2867.68 --> 2867.86]  right?
[2868.70 --> 2869.60]  And what happened
[2869.60 --> 2870.14]  in Jerusalem?
[2870.14 --> 2874.38]  That is where
[2874.38 --> 2875.36]  Jesus was crucified,
[2876.14 --> 2876.28]  right?
[2876.72 --> 2877.72]  That is where
[2877.72 --> 2878.66]  the resurrection
[2878.66 --> 2879.72]  happened in Jerusalem.
[2879.94 --> 2880.40]  That is where
[2880.40 --> 2881.26]  Jesus ascended
[2881.26 --> 2881.86]  into heaven.
[2882.40 --> 2883.16]  This is where
[2883.16 --> 2884.18]  the church received
[2884.18 --> 2885.48]  the gift of the Holy Spirit
[2885.48 --> 2886.42]  on Pentecost.
[2886.42 --> 2887.30]  This is where
[2887.30 --> 2888.12]  the church began
[2888.12 --> 2888.86]  to take shape
[2888.86 --> 2889.74]  for the first time
[2889.74 --> 2891.02]  and the first Christians
[2891.02 --> 2892.22]  were Jews.
[2893.16 --> 2893.94]  And even though
[2893.94 --> 2894.54]  the church
[2894.54 --> 2895.70]  was then scattered
[2895.70 --> 2896.96]  because of
[2896.96 --> 2897.52]  the martyrdom
[2897.52 --> 2898.02]  of Stephen,
[2898.42 --> 2899.70]  it was diversified
[2899.70 --> 2900.46]  by Gentiles
[2900.46 --> 2901.50]  entering into
[2901.50 --> 2902.26]  faith in Jesus,
[2903.04 --> 2904.58]  Jerusalem was really
[2904.58 --> 2906.00]  the center of the church.
[2906.56 --> 2907.30]  And the church
[2907.30 --> 2908.34]  up until that point
[2908.34 --> 2910.06]  had a Jewish identity.
[2910.98 --> 2912.18]  So when this conflict
[2912.18 --> 2913.32]  began to emerge,
[2913.98 --> 2914.66]  where do they go
[2914.66 --> 2915.22]  to solve it?
[2916.22 --> 2916.80]  They go back
[2916.80 --> 2917.34]  to Jerusalem,
[2917.44 --> 2917.56]  right?
[2917.64 --> 2918.66]  They don't stay
[2918.66 --> 2919.50]  in Antioch
[2919.50 --> 2920.20]  to hash this out.
[2920.40 --> 2921.38]  They don't go to Rome.
[2921.46 --> 2922.18]  The gospel hasn't
[2922.18 --> 2923.10]  even gone there yet.
[2923.24 --> 2923.92]  They go back
[2923.92 --> 2924.54]  to Jerusalem
[2924.54 --> 2925.96]  to solve the problem.
[2926.94 --> 2928.16]  So there's a strong
[2928.16 --> 2928.94]  fundamental
[2928.94 --> 2929.86]  Jewish identity
[2929.86 --> 2930.76]  to the church.
[2931.50 --> 2932.48]  And that explains
[2932.48 --> 2933.38]  what happens
[2933.38 --> 2935.12]  in verses 1 to 6.
[2935.80 --> 2936.88]  So look at verse 1
[2936.88 --> 2937.72]  with me again here.
[2938.96 --> 2939.74]  Verse 1 says,
[2940.22 --> 2940.98]  certain people
[2940.98 --> 2941.74]  came down
[2941.74 --> 2942.82]  from Judea.
[2942.90 --> 2943.52]  Now that's
[2943.52 --> 2944.30]  always confusing,
[2944.42 --> 2944.54]  right?
[2944.60 --> 2945.46]  Because Judea
[2945.46 --> 2946.28]  is actually south
[2946.28 --> 2946.92]  of Antioch,
[2947.14 --> 2948.84]  but it was higher up
[2948.84 --> 2949.46]  elevation-wise.
[2949.54 --> 2950.62]  So they go down
[2950.62 --> 2951.22]  north.
[2951.86 --> 2952.60]  They came down
[2952.60 --> 2953.42]  from Judea
[2953.42 --> 2954.14]  northward
[2954.14 --> 2955.02]  to Antioch.
[2955.18 --> 2955.58]  And they were
[2955.58 --> 2956.50]  teaching the believers,
[2956.50 --> 2958.16]  unless you are
[2958.16 --> 2959.08]  circumcised
[2959.08 --> 2959.96]  according to the
[2959.96 --> 2960.84]  custom taught
[2960.84 --> 2961.32]  by Moses,
[2961.56 --> 2962.42]  you cannot
[2962.42 --> 2963.34]  be saved.
[2964.96 --> 2966.18]  These Jewish men,
[2966.28 --> 2966.88]  they come down
[2966.88 --> 2967.52]  from Judea,
[2967.64 --> 2968.66]  they go to Antioch,
[2968.90 --> 2969.44]  and they begin
[2969.44 --> 2970.30]  to tell the Gentile
[2970.30 --> 2970.58]  church,
[2970.68 --> 2971.46]  listen Gentiles,
[2971.86 --> 2973.28]  we're really glad
[2973.28 --> 2974.20]  you believe in Jesus
[2974.20 --> 2974.64]  and all,
[2975.24 --> 2976.08]  but if you really
[2976.08 --> 2977.28]  want to be saved,
[2977.38 --> 2978.00]  if you want to become
[2978.00 --> 2978.92]  part of the people
[2978.92 --> 2979.38]  of God,
[2979.52 --> 2980.36]  you have got
[2980.36 --> 2981.14]  to take on
[2981.14 --> 2982.24]  a Jewish identity.
[2982.84 --> 2983.48]  The church's
[2983.48 --> 2984.88]  identity is Jewish.
[2984.88 --> 2986.12]  So if you're
[2986.12 --> 2986.80]  going to join us,
[2986.86 --> 2987.50]  you're going to go
[2987.50 --> 2988.18]  through the Jewish
[2988.18 --> 2989.18]  new members class,
[2989.60 --> 2990.64]  and you're going
[2990.64 --> 2991.48]  to be circumcised,
[2991.56 --> 2991.92]  and that's what
[2991.92 --> 2992.38]  we're going to do.
[2993.64 --> 2993.88]  Okay,
[2993.94 --> 2994.54]  but then you have
[2994.54 --> 2995.38]  these leaders
[2995.38 --> 2996.60]  of the Gentile church
[2996.60 --> 2997.44]  who are themselves
[2997.44 --> 2997.88]  Jews,
[2998.68 --> 2999.50]  and you've got men
[2999.50 --> 3000.96]  like Paul and Barnabas,
[3001.60 --> 3003.02]  and what they're saying
[3003.02 --> 3003.90]  is the church's
[3003.90 --> 3004.88]  identity can also
[3004.88 --> 3005.64]  be Gentile.
[3005.98 --> 3006.76]  It's not just
[3006.76 --> 3007.52]  about being Jewish,
[3007.52 --> 3008.20]  but it can also
[3008.20 --> 3009.84]  have a Gentile identity,
[3010.40 --> 3011.14]  so they don't know
[3011.14 --> 3011.54]  what to do.
[3012.66 --> 3013.74]  So they go to Jerusalem,
[3013.88 --> 3014.46]  and they basically
[3014.46 --> 3015.56]  try to settle this
[3015.56 --> 3016.64]  with the apostles
[3016.64 --> 3017.74]  and the elders,
[3018.30 --> 3019.90]  the leaders of the church
[3019.90 --> 3021.22]  who are based in Jerusalem.
[3022.44 --> 3022.92]  So,
[3023.18 --> 3024.54]  some Jewish leaders,
[3025.18 --> 3025.56]  so they're going
[3025.56 --> 3026.16]  to have this debate.
[3026.56 --> 3027.24]  They're in a council,
[3027.34 --> 3028.36]  it's like the first council.
[3028.94 --> 3029.62]  They're just like synod,
[3029.90 --> 3030.48]  kind of like that.
[3031.26 --> 3032.76]  The Jewish leaders stand up.
[3033.34 --> 3034.50]  Look at verse 5 with me.
[3034.56 --> 3035.30]  It's here on the screen.
[3035.30 --> 3037.80]  Then some of the believers
[3037.80 --> 3039.06]  who belonged to the party
[3039.06 --> 3040.16]  of the Pharisees
[3040.16 --> 3041.82]  stood up and said,
[3041.82 --> 3044.32]  the Gentiles must be circumcised
[3044.32 --> 3045.00]  and required
[3045.00 --> 3046.38]  to keep the law of Moses.
[3047.42 --> 3047.92]  Okay, notice,
[3048.08 --> 3049.12]  this is the Pharisees.
[3049.18 --> 3050.22]  Remember the Pharisees?
[3050.56 --> 3051.52]  Right, from the Gospels,
[3051.64 --> 3052.06]  they're the guys
[3052.06 --> 3052.82]  who are always like
[3052.82 --> 3054.00]  giving Jesus a hard time.
[3054.90 --> 3055.66]  Some of them
[3055.66 --> 3057.02]  became Christians.
[3057.42 --> 3057.96]  Some of them believe
[3057.96 --> 3058.94]  Jesus is the Messiah.
[3060.94 --> 3062.30]  But they still believe
[3062.30 --> 3062.94]  that the point
[3062.94 --> 3064.06]  of Jesus' work
[3064.06 --> 3065.34]  is to bring all nations
[3065.34 --> 3066.54]  into the nation of Israel.
[3066.54 --> 3068.08]  So they say,
[3068.48 --> 3069.72]  these Gentile believers
[3069.72 --> 3071.44]  are being grafted
[3071.44 --> 3072.88]  into a Jewish church.
[3073.42 --> 3075.08]  They have to be circumcised.
[3075.18 --> 3076.36]  They have to keep the law
[3076.36 --> 3078.12]  in order to be set apart
[3078.12 --> 3079.30]  as the people of God.
[3079.66 --> 3081.40]  Just like God's people
[3081.40 --> 3082.50]  always have
[3082.50 --> 3084.38]  throughout the Old Testament.
[3085.14 --> 3085.86]  That's their argument.
[3085.96 --> 3086.64]  That's what they're saying.
[3087.48 --> 3089.22]  Then Peter gets up and speaks
[3089.22 --> 3091.38]  and he tells the story
[3091.38 --> 3092.26]  about the Gentiles
[3092.26 --> 3092.90]  being converted.
[3093.60 --> 3094.52]  So look at verse 8.
[3095.72 --> 3096.36]  Peter says,
[3097.06 --> 3098.54]  God, who knows the heart,
[3098.94 --> 3100.16]  showed that he accepted them
[3100.16 --> 3100.88]  by giving them,
[3101.52 --> 3102.58]  by giving the Holy Spirit
[3102.58 --> 3103.28]  to them
[3103.28 --> 3104.76]  just as he did to us.
[3105.04 --> 3106.14]  He did not discriminate
[3106.14 --> 3107.46]  between us and them
[3107.46 --> 3109.20]  for he purified their hearts
[3109.20 --> 3110.72]  by faith
[3110.72 --> 3111.98]  apart from the law.
[3112.90 --> 3114.02]  Then in verse 11
[3114.02 --> 3114.84]  it says this.
[3116.54 --> 3116.90]  No,
[3117.16 --> 3118.26]  we believe
[3118.26 --> 3119.84]  it is through the grace
[3119.84 --> 3120.76]  of our Lord Jesus
[3120.76 --> 3122.54]  that we are saved
[3122.54 --> 3124.68]  just as they are.
[3124.68 --> 3128.76]  And so Peter says,
[3129.40 --> 3129.58]  look,
[3129.66 --> 3130.66]  the church can also
[3130.66 --> 3131.52]  be Gentile.
[3132.12 --> 3132.44]  Right?
[3132.54 --> 3133.32]  In Christ,
[3133.64 --> 3134.74]  through the Holy Spirit,
[3134.88 --> 3135.84]  God makes us
[3135.84 --> 3136.66]  spiritually clean.
[3137.18 --> 3138.56]  And it's not by following
[3138.56 --> 3139.38]  the Mosaic law.
[3139.42 --> 3140.06]  It's not by following
[3140.06 --> 3140.72]  the set of rules.
[3140.82 --> 3141.60]  It is through faith
[3141.60 --> 3142.36]  in Jesus Christ.
[3142.78 --> 3144.10]  And we know this
[3144.10 --> 3145.82]  because God gave them
[3145.82 --> 3146.72]  the Holy Spirit
[3146.72 --> 3147.72]  the same as us.
[3147.72 --> 3149.18]  So the church
[3149.18 --> 3150.42]  doesn't have to be Jewish.
[3151.42 --> 3152.08]  And that is part
[3152.08 --> 3152.94]  of what Peter says.
[3153.64 --> 3154.60]  So you see this debate
[3154.60 --> 3155.04]  happening.
[3155.42 --> 3155.96]  And the church
[3155.96 --> 3156.92]  has to wrestle with this.
[3156.98 --> 3158.58]  This is a significant
[3158.58 --> 3159.74]  turning point.
[3159.84 --> 3161.04]  This was a huge decision.
[3161.36 --> 3162.90]  This was a hard question
[3162.90 --> 3164.00]  that we now take for granted.
[3165.04 --> 3166.00]  It wasn't easy.
[3166.32 --> 3166.86]  Does the church
[3166.86 --> 3168.04]  have a Gentile identity?
[3168.56 --> 3169.38]  Or does it have
[3169.38 --> 3170.16]  a Jewish identity?
[3170.36 --> 3171.26]  How does this work?
[3172.06 --> 3173.78]  And in response to this,
[3173.96 --> 3175.24]  James stands up.
[3175.36 --> 3176.44]  Now James is the brother
[3176.44 --> 3176.94]  of Jesus.
[3177.74 --> 3179.20]  And he is also the leader
[3179.20 --> 3180.24]  of the church in Jerusalem.
[3181.00 --> 3182.00]  He stands up
[3182.00 --> 3182.70]  and he says this.
[3182.76 --> 3183.10]  He says,
[3183.24 --> 3183.86]  listen to me.
[3184.56 --> 3186.14]  I want you to understand
[3186.14 --> 3188.24]  that God does bring
[3188.24 --> 3189.26]  the Gentiles in.
[3190.02 --> 3192.26]  The prophets have said this.
[3193.04 --> 3194.22]  So look at verse 16.
[3195.60 --> 3196.76]  He's quoting from
[3196.76 --> 3197.46]  the book of Amos.
[3197.82 --> 3198.16]  He says,
[3198.16 --> 3199.16]  after this I will return,
[3200.00 --> 3200.48]  God speaking,
[3200.96 --> 3202.64]  and rebuild David's
[3202.64 --> 3203.28]  fallen tent.
[3203.38 --> 3204.40]  That is the nation of Israel.
[3205.10 --> 3205.80]  It's ruins,
[3205.80 --> 3206.44]  God says,
[3206.56 --> 3207.24]  I will rebuild,
[3207.38 --> 3208.36]  I will restore it.
[3208.56 --> 3209.94]  That the rest of mankind
[3209.94 --> 3211.48]  may seek the Lord,
[3211.88 --> 3213.46]  even all the Gentiles
[3213.46 --> 3215.70]  who bear my name.
[3216.68 --> 3217.70]  Says the Lord
[3217.70 --> 3218.78]  who does these things.
[3219.06 --> 3220.44]  Things known from long ago.
[3220.78 --> 3221.40]  So basically,
[3221.54 --> 3222.18]  James is saying,
[3222.28 --> 3222.46]  look,
[3223.16 --> 3224.08]  I'm going to show you
[3224.08 --> 3225.28]  from the scriptures,
[3226.24 --> 3227.68]  and he's quoting from Amos,
[3227.90 --> 3228.76]  that the identity
[3228.76 --> 3229.48]  of the church
[3229.48 --> 3231.32]  is not fundamentally Jewish,
[3231.32 --> 3233.84]  and it is not
[3233.84 --> 3235.10]  fundamentally Gentile.
[3236.10 --> 3237.82]  It is a new thing
[3237.82 --> 3239.40]  that God has always
[3239.40 --> 3240.38]  intended to create.
[3241.22 --> 3241.94]  And that means
[3241.94 --> 3243.00]  that our identity,
[3243.16 --> 3243.28]  friends,
[3243.34 --> 3244.58]  is not derived
[3244.58 --> 3245.54]  from our culture,
[3246.16 --> 3246.92]  whether Jew
[3246.92 --> 3247.86]  or Gentile.
[3248.28 --> 3249.46]  It is derived,
[3249.80 --> 3250.28]  and I'm going to use
[3250.28 --> 3251.44]  a theological term here,
[3251.92 --> 3252.78]  it is derived
[3252.78 --> 3254.12]  eschatologically.
[3254.90 --> 3255.32]  The eschaton
[3256.08 --> 3256.82]  refers to
[3256.82 --> 3257.98]  the end of times.
[3258.58 --> 3259.88]  And this is what Amos
[3259.88 --> 3260.90]  here is talking about.
[3261.56 --> 3262.52]  And so James is saying,
[3262.68 --> 3263.32]  if you want to know
[3263.32 --> 3264.84]  what our identity is,
[3265.48 --> 3266.98]  look at what God is doing.
[3267.52 --> 3268.32]  He is building
[3268.32 --> 3269.68]  one big church
[3269.68 --> 3270.92]  of both Jew
[3270.92 --> 3272.28]  and Gentile
[3272.28 --> 3273.58]  from around the world.
[3274.26 --> 3274.86]  And that, friends,
[3274.90 --> 3275.90]  is how we have to think
[3275.90 --> 3276.72]  about our identity
[3276.72 --> 3277.30]  as a church.
[3277.38 --> 3278.20]  It's not fundamentally
[3278.20 --> 3279.76]  our story.
[3280.58 --> 3280.80]  Right?
[3280.98 --> 3282.32]  It's Jesus' story
[3282.32 --> 3283.50]  that we have been
[3283.50 --> 3284.06]  brought into.
[3284.98 --> 3285.64]  And therefore,
[3285.78 --> 3286.82]  the identity of the church
[3286.82 --> 3287.82]  is not fundamentally
[3287.82 --> 3288.36]  understood
[3288.36 --> 3289.96]  in light of our own
[3289.96 --> 3290.78]  personal history
[3290.78 --> 3292.68]  or our own
[3292.68 --> 3294.16]  tradition,
[3294.50 --> 3295.14]  our denomination,
[3295.76 --> 3296.88]  our own preferences,
[3297.16 --> 3298.24]  what kind of songs we sing
[3298.24 --> 3298.90]  or sing
[3298.90 --> 3300.16]  or our styles of worship.
[3300.84 --> 3302.26]  But our identity
[3302.26 --> 3302.96]  is understood
[3302.96 --> 3303.62]  in light
[3303.62 --> 3305.48]  of God's purposes,
[3306.08 --> 3306.94]  God's intentions
[3306.94 --> 3307.72]  for the church.
[3309.00 --> 3309.82]  And what that means
[3309.82 --> 3310.74]  is that the church
[3310.74 --> 3313.36]  that is self-consciously Jewish
[3313.36 --> 3315.18]  and self-consciously
[3315.18 --> 3315.92]  Gentile
[3315.92 --> 3317.70]  actually has to give way
[3317.70 --> 3318.70]  to a church
[3318.70 --> 3320.28]  that is self-consciously
[3320.28 --> 3321.12]  one holy
[3321.12 --> 3322.56]  Catholic and apostolic church,
[3323.02 --> 3323.90]  a new identity.
[3324.98 --> 3326.56]  Everybody has to reconceive
[3326.56 --> 3327.30]  of their identities.
[3327.74 --> 3327.82]  Right?
[3328.04 --> 3328.40]  He says,
[3328.50 --> 3328.86]  Jews,
[3329.38 --> 3330.64]  you can't understand
[3330.64 --> 3331.18]  yourselves
[3331.18 --> 3332.64]  apart from the Gentiles.
[3333.06 --> 3333.82]  And Gentiles,
[3333.92 --> 3334.56]  you can't understand
[3334.56 --> 3335.34]  yourself apart
[3335.34 --> 3336.00]  from the Jews.
[3336.20 --> 3336.94]  We're all part
[3336.94 --> 3337.76]  of the same story
[3337.76 --> 3338.62]  that God is doing.
[3339.46 --> 3340.24]  And that is what
[3340.24 --> 3341.08]  is being worked out here.
[3341.16 --> 3342.08]  The church has to
[3342.08 --> 3343.06]  reconceive
[3343.06 --> 3344.04]  our identities.
[3344.20 --> 3344.78]  It has to see
[3344.78 --> 3346.52]  what God is doing
[3346.52 --> 3347.42]  and what he intends
[3347.42 --> 3347.82]  to do.
[3348.82 --> 3349.86]  And this isn't James
[3349.86 --> 3350.92]  just being a good leader
[3350.92 --> 3351.58]  and a good pastor.
[3352.08 --> 3352.78]  Because remember,
[3352.90 --> 3353.46]  who is James?
[3354.46 --> 3355.84]  James has gone
[3355.84 --> 3357.18]  through this himself.
[3357.94 --> 3358.06]  Right?
[3358.12 --> 3358.44]  Remember,
[3358.56 --> 3359.28]  for years,
[3359.52 --> 3361.02]  he misunderstood Jesus.
[3361.80 --> 3362.68]  He didn't understand
[3362.68 --> 3363.66]  Jesus' identity.
[3364.18 --> 3364.36]  Right?
[3364.42 --> 3365.26]  Even though he was
[3365.26 --> 3365.94]  Jesus' brother,
[3366.32 --> 3367.04]  he thought that Jesus
[3367.04 --> 3367.58]  was crazy.
[3368.08 --> 3369.02]  He tried to get Jesus
[3369.02 --> 3369.84]  to stop preaching
[3369.84 --> 3370.76]  on many occasions.
[3371.84 --> 3372.62]  But then what happened?
[3373.32 --> 3374.50]  Jesus rose from the dead.
[3375.46 --> 3376.78]  He began then
[3376.78 --> 3378.36]  to see Jesus' identity
[3378.36 --> 3379.56]  completely differently.
[3380.30 --> 3380.98]  And he began to see
[3380.98 --> 3382.12]  his own identity differently.
[3382.66 --> 3383.32]  And he went from
[3383.32 --> 3384.82]  being a critic of Jesus
[3384.82 --> 3387.04]  to a servant of Jesus.
[3387.70 --> 3388.58]  And then also a leader
[3388.58 --> 3389.40]  of the church.
[3390.62 --> 3391.52]  And so then James,
[3392.12 --> 3393.04]  having gone through
[3393.04 --> 3394.74]  this reconceiving
[3394.74 --> 3395.80]  of identity himself,
[3395.96 --> 3397.14]  he leads the church
[3397.14 --> 3398.48]  in reconceiving
[3398.48 --> 3399.08]  its identity
[3399.08 --> 3400.20]  in light of what
[3400.20 --> 3401.16]  Jesus has done.
[3401.68 --> 3402.60]  In light of
[3402.60 --> 3403.36]  what Jesus is still
[3403.36 --> 3404.16]  doing in the church.
[3405.84 --> 3406.62]  So let me ask
[3406.62 --> 3407.18]  this a question.
[3409.18 --> 3410.26]  How do you,
[3410.44 --> 3410.92]  to the extent
[3410.92 --> 3411.42]  that you do,
[3412.22 --> 3412.90]  think about
[3412.90 --> 3413.44]  the identity
[3413.44 --> 3414.14]  of the church?
[3415.02 --> 3416.10]  Do you see
[3416.10 --> 3416.62]  the identity
[3416.62 --> 3417.24]  of the church
[3417.24 --> 3418.76]  through your own history,
[3419.44 --> 3420.24]  through your own
[3420.24 --> 3420.72]  preferences,
[3421.76 --> 3422.74]  through your own vision
[3422.74 --> 3423.64]  of what you think
[3423.64 --> 3424.50]  the church should be?
[3425.38 --> 3426.56]  Or do you think
[3426.56 --> 3427.44]  about the church
[3427.44 --> 3428.70]  through what Jesus
[3428.70 --> 3429.58]  is doing
[3429.58 --> 3430.40]  in the world?
[3431.06 --> 3432.24]  It's a big question,
[3432.32 --> 3432.86]  but it's an important
[3432.86 --> 3433.30]  question.
[3435.16 --> 3436.12]  Then secondly,
[3436.26 --> 3437.58]  there's a second decision,
[3439.34 --> 3440.36]  the second work
[3440.36 --> 3441.20]  of living together
[3441.20 --> 3441.88]  as the church.
[3442.08 --> 3443.10]  And it's not just
[3443.10 --> 3444.18]  reconceiving our identity,
[3444.18 --> 3444.84]  but it's also
[3444.84 --> 3445.68]  practicing love.
[3446.34 --> 3446.78]  Okay, the church
[3446.78 --> 3447.46]  has to learn
[3447.46 --> 3448.68]  to practice love.
[3449.00 --> 3449.82]  Because what are
[3449.82 --> 3450.60]  God's intentions?
[3450.60 --> 3452.36]  is to build
[3452.36 --> 3453.10]  a community
[3453.10 --> 3453.94]  of love
[3453.94 --> 3455.16]  among us.
[3455.20 --> 3455.56]  That is what
[3455.56 --> 3456.28]  the church is.
[3456.82 --> 3457.38]  And that's what
[3457.38 --> 3457.94]  God is doing.
[3458.10 --> 3458.42]  And so,
[3458.62 --> 3459.40]  here's what James
[3459.40 --> 3459.88]  says,
[3460.78 --> 3462.30]  beginning in verse 19.
[3463.14 --> 3463.78]  So James,
[3463.98 --> 3465.12]  in all of his wisdom,
[3466.08 --> 3466.44]  he says,
[3466.52 --> 3467.34]  it is my judgment,
[3467.60 --> 3467.84]  therefore,
[3468.46 --> 3469.28]  that we should not
[3469.28 --> 3469.98]  make it difficult
[3469.98 --> 3470.88]  for the Gentiles
[3470.88 --> 3471.90]  who are turning to God.
[3472.54 --> 3472.94]  Instead,
[3473.14 --> 3474.02]  we should write to them,
[3474.54 --> 3475.18]  telling them
[3475.18 --> 3475.92]  to abstain
[3475.92 --> 3477.24]  from food-polluted idols,
[3477.86 --> 3479.08]  from sexual immorality,
[3479.08 --> 3480.56]  from the meat
[3480.56 --> 3481.50]  of strangled animals,
[3482.04 --> 3482.74]  and from blood.
[3483.66 --> 3484.12]  And as,
[3484.32 --> 3485.00]  we didn't read it,
[3485.02 --> 3485.66]  but if you continue
[3485.66 --> 3487.00]  reading past
[3487.00 --> 3488.26]  verse 21 in Acts 15,
[3488.32 --> 3489.06]  you can read the letter
[3489.06 --> 3489.62]  that they sent.
[3489.72 --> 3490.22]  I encourage you
[3490.22 --> 3490.96]  to go back and read it.
[3492.12 --> 3492.46]  And so,
[3492.86 --> 3493.04]  now,
[3493.18 --> 3494.28]  led by the Holy Spirit,
[3494.78 --> 3495.56]  following James,
[3495.62 --> 3496.46]  the whole church,
[3496.72 --> 3497.30]  they had reached
[3497.30 --> 3498.46]  a consensus about this.
[3498.70 --> 3499.66]  And they responded
[3499.66 --> 3500.76]  to this conflict
[3500.76 --> 3502.50]  by practicing love
[3502.50 --> 3503.32]  towards one another.
[3504.06 --> 3504.66]  And so what they do,
[3504.72 --> 3505.04]  as I said,
[3505.06 --> 3505.44]  is they write
[3505.44 --> 3506.52]  this pastoral letter
[3506.52 --> 3507.86]  that calls everybody
[3507.86 --> 3509.56]  to give something
[3509.56 --> 3510.62]  to love the other.
[3510.80 --> 3511.44]  That's what they do.
[3512.06 --> 3512.36]  They say,
[3512.42 --> 3512.52]  okay,
[3512.54 --> 3513.46]  how are we going to do this?
[3514.10 --> 3515.36]  They don't start a committee.
[3516.44 --> 3517.56]  They don't write a confession.
[3518.08 --> 3518.86]  They don't start
[3518.86 --> 3519.72]  doing term rotations.
[3520.82 --> 3522.12]  They tell everyone
[3522.12 --> 3523.38]  to love one another.
[3523.58 --> 3524.16]  That's what they do.
[3524.82 --> 3525.44]  So first,
[3526.12 --> 3527.92]  what do Jewish Christians
[3527.92 --> 3530.30]  do to practice love?
[3531.24 --> 3532.18]  They are asked
[3532.18 --> 3533.72]  to embrace the Gentiles
[3533.72 --> 3534.80]  without requiring
[3534.80 --> 3535.40]  the Gentiles
[3535.40 --> 3536.12]  to keep the law.
[3536.12 --> 3538.58]  That is amazing.
[3539.58 --> 3540.40]  That these Jews,
[3540.50 --> 3541.72]  they were so deeply
[3541.72 --> 3542.58]  embedded in their
[3542.58 --> 3543.34]  Jewish identity,
[3543.78 --> 3545.22]  keeping the ceremonial law,
[3545.74 --> 3546.38]  even though they
[3546.38 --> 3547.20]  had become Christians.
[3548.34 --> 3549.14]  And they're saying,
[3549.34 --> 3549.56]  now,
[3549.92 --> 3550.20]  no,
[3550.66 --> 3551.72]  you don't have
[3551.72 --> 3552.72]  to keep the law anymore.
[3552.88 --> 3553.82]  I am going to embrace
[3553.82 --> 3554.68]  you as my brother.
[3555.72 --> 3555.90]  Right?
[3555.94 --> 3557.02]  That's absolutely amazing.
[3557.72 --> 3559.04]  And why did they do that?
[3559.08 --> 3559.88]  Is it because they're suddenly
[3559.88 --> 3561.10]  giving up on
[3561.10 --> 3561.74]  the Old Testament?
[3562.70 --> 3563.14]  No.
[3564.14 --> 3565.18]  It's because of love.
[3565.18 --> 3565.24]  love.
[3565.76 --> 3566.92]  They understood
[3566.92 --> 3568.12]  that keeping the law
[3568.12 --> 3569.54]  would make it too hard
[3569.54 --> 3570.76]  for their Gentile
[3570.76 --> 3571.60]  brothers and sisters.
[3572.28 --> 3572.96]  It was going to be
[3572.96 --> 3573.82]  too hard for them
[3573.82 --> 3574.50]  to do this.
[3575.12 --> 3575.68]  In fact,
[3575.90 --> 3576.94]  they acknowledged
[3576.94 --> 3577.54]  that actually
[3577.54 --> 3578.22]  neither them
[3578.22 --> 3579.58]  nor their forefathers
[3579.58 --> 3581.40]  were able to keep it anyway.
[3581.98 --> 3582.94]  Why would we make them
[3582.94 --> 3583.60]  try to do it?
[3584.74 --> 3585.78]  So even though
[3585.78 --> 3586.56]  it was important
[3586.56 --> 3587.42]  to them culturally
[3587.42 --> 3588.28]  and personally,
[3588.98 --> 3589.78]  they are going
[3589.78 --> 3590.78]  to practice love
[3590.78 --> 3591.56]  by giving up
[3591.56 --> 3592.70]  something they value.
[3592.70 --> 3594.70]  and they acknowledge
[3594.70 --> 3595.38]  that Jesus
[3595.38 --> 3596.42]  has fulfilled
[3596.42 --> 3597.58]  the righteous requirements
[3597.58 --> 3598.26]  of the law
[3598.26 --> 3598.98]  in our place.
[3599.50 --> 3600.10]  And so the law
[3600.10 --> 3600.98]  is not what makes you
[3600.98 --> 3601.62]  right with God.
[3601.68 --> 3602.18]  We are saved
[3602.18 --> 3603.30]  by faith in Jesus.
[3603.84 --> 3604.68]  God purifies
[3604.68 --> 3605.14]  our hearts
[3605.14 --> 3605.64]  through faith.
[3606.54 --> 3607.56]  And so the Jewish Christians,
[3607.76 --> 3608.70]  they decide
[3608.70 --> 3609.76]  to practice love
[3609.76 --> 3611.06]  by not requiring
[3611.06 --> 3612.22]  the Gentile Christians
[3612.22 --> 3613.34]  to observe
[3613.34 --> 3614.58]  their Jewish customs
[3614.58 --> 3615.14]  and practices.
[3615.14 --> 3617.72]  But then,
[3617.82 --> 3618.88]  the Gentile Christians
[3618.88 --> 3619.78]  are also called
[3619.78 --> 3620.80]  to the practice of love.
[3621.42 --> 3622.52]  They were asked
[3622.52 --> 3624.02]  to follow
[3624.02 --> 3625.54]  some of the Jewish
[3625.54 --> 3626.42]  food customs
[3626.42 --> 3628.28]  and they were asked
[3628.28 --> 3628.90]  to hold
[3628.90 --> 3630.26]  to a high standard
[3630.26 --> 3631.20]  of sexual purity,
[3631.62 --> 3632.74]  something that the Gentile
[3632.74 --> 3634.04]  world and culture
[3634.04 --> 3635.36]  generally struggled with.
[3636.32 --> 3638.44]  Not because they believe
[3638.44 --> 3639.88]  that following
[3639.88 --> 3641.02]  ceremonial laws
[3641.02 --> 3641.78]  or keeping
[3641.78 --> 3643.70]  sexual purity laws,
[3643.76 --> 3644.66]  which is the moral law,
[3644.66 --> 3645.60]  not that any of that
[3645.60 --> 3646.48]  saves you,
[3647.34 --> 3648.52]  but why then
[3648.52 --> 3649.10]  would they ask them
[3649.10 --> 3649.62]  to do this?
[3649.70 --> 3650.62]  Because of love.
[3651.32 --> 3652.36]  Because they knew
[3652.36 --> 3653.40]  that Jews would have
[3653.40 --> 3655.22]  a hard time
[3655.22 --> 3657.24]  sitting at the table
[3657.24 --> 3658.06]  in fellowship
[3658.06 --> 3659.28]  with Gentiles
[3659.28 --> 3661.24]  who are eating
[3661.24 --> 3662.90]  all of these things,
[3662.94 --> 3663.82]  like meat sacrificed
[3663.82 --> 3664.26]  to idols,
[3664.44 --> 3665.38]  meat with blood in it.
[3665.78 --> 3666.26]  They knew
[3666.26 --> 3667.18]  their Jewish brothers
[3667.18 --> 3668.34]  couldn't handle it.
[3668.86 --> 3669.64]  It's just too
[3669.64 --> 3671.00]  against everything
[3671.00 --> 3673.10]  that they are culturally.
[3673.58 --> 3673.94]  It would be
[3673.94 --> 3674.76]  too hard for them.
[3675.04 --> 3675.76]  And what they want,
[3675.82 --> 3676.72]  what the church wants
[3676.72 --> 3677.96]  is for Jew and Gentile
[3677.96 --> 3678.90]  to be together.
[3679.94 --> 3680.70]  So when the leaders
[3680.70 --> 3681.18]  of the church,
[3681.26 --> 3682.08]  they write this letter
[3682.08 --> 3683.24]  to the Gentile Christians,
[3683.42 --> 3683.90]  they tell them
[3683.90 --> 3684.44]  their decision,
[3685.00 --> 3686.02]  they don't say,
[3686.24 --> 3686.42]  okay,
[3686.70 --> 3687.96]  you don't have to keep
[3687.96 --> 3688.76]  the Jewish customs
[3688.76 --> 3689.68]  to be saved,
[3690.20 --> 3692.54]  so just never mind
[3692.54 --> 3693.16]  about the Jews
[3693.16 --> 3693.78]  and their scruples,
[3693.94 --> 3694.06]  right?
[3694.08 --> 3694.90]  Just forget them,
[3695.50 --> 3695.72]  right?
[3695.76 --> 3696.72]  They don't say that.
[3697.70 --> 3698.82]  But they say rather,
[3699.40 --> 3700.50]  please abstain
[3700.50 --> 3701.82]  from these food practices
[3701.82 --> 3702.84]  because they are
[3702.84 --> 3703.88]  offensive to the Jews,
[3704.40 --> 3704.54]  right?
[3704.58 --> 3705.80]  Not because by doing so
[3705.80 --> 3706.28]  it makes you right
[3706.28 --> 3706.76]  with God,
[3707.30 --> 3708.34]  but out of love.
[3709.18 --> 3709.94]  Be gracious.
[3712.76 --> 3713.24]  And do you know
[3713.24 --> 3714.38]  why James is leading
[3714.38 --> 3715.90]  the church to do this?
[3716.48 --> 3717.70]  He is calling the church
[3717.70 --> 3718.42]  to practice love.
[3718.48 --> 3719.30]  Why is he doing that?
[3719.70 --> 3720.86]  It's because he knew
[3720.86 --> 3722.08]  firsthand what it means
[3722.08 --> 3723.12]  for somebody else
[3723.12 --> 3725.04]  to deny themselves
[3725.04 --> 3726.62]  for him
[3726.62 --> 3728.84]  so that he can live.
[3728.84 --> 3730.44]  He learned that
[3730.44 --> 3731.18]  through the life,
[3731.60 --> 3732.16]  the suffering,
[3732.30 --> 3733.28]  and the crucifixion
[3733.28 --> 3734.70]  of his brother Jesus.
[3735.84 --> 3736.60]  And he knows
[3736.60 --> 3737.66]  that the only way
[3737.66 --> 3738.60]  the church is going
[3738.60 --> 3739.76]  to become the church
[3739.76 --> 3741.08]  that Jesus intends
[3741.08 --> 3741.76]  for it to be
[3741.76 --> 3744.08]  is through imitating
[3744.08 --> 3745.58]  the self-giving love
[3745.58 --> 3746.52]  of Christ himself.
[3748.10 --> 3749.20]  And what we see here
[3749.20 --> 3750.30]  is exactly what we see
[3750.30 --> 3751.52]  in the letter of Galatians.
[3752.16 --> 3753.20]  The letter of Galatians,
[3753.34 --> 3754.38]  many commentators say,
[3754.44 --> 3755.48]  was written by Paul
[3755.48 --> 3757.48]  when the newer view,
[3757.48 --> 3758.14]  understanding,
[3758.28 --> 3758.96]  is that it was written
[3758.96 --> 3760.48]  on his journey
[3760.48 --> 3761.96]  to this very council
[3761.96 --> 3762.52]  in Jerusalem.
[3763.40 --> 3764.26]  It was during that period
[3764.26 --> 3764.66]  of time,
[3764.74 --> 3765.40]  during his travels,
[3765.50 --> 3766.26]  that he wrote a letter,
[3766.36 --> 3767.66]  the letter of Galatians,
[3767.76 --> 3770.00]  the earliest letter of Paul,
[3770.32 --> 3771.84]  to all of these Gentile churches
[3771.84 --> 3772.70]  that he had just went
[3772.70 --> 3773.74]  to preach the gospel in.
[3774.74 --> 3775.62]  And one of the things
[3775.62 --> 3776.58]  that he said to them,
[3776.62 --> 3778.04]  which touches on this whole debate,
[3778.68 --> 3779.64]  was simply this.
[3780.34 --> 3781.66]  Galatians 5, 13.
[3782.42 --> 3784.10]  You, my brothers and sisters,
[3784.58 --> 3785.74]  were called to be free,
[3785.74 --> 3787.70]  but do not use your freedom
[3787.70 --> 3789.04]  to indulge the flesh.
[3789.60 --> 3791.78]  Rather, serve one another
[3791.78 --> 3792.80]  humbly in love.
[3794.24 --> 3794.52]  Right?
[3794.58 --> 3795.12]  In other words,
[3795.24 --> 3795.80]  Paul is saying,
[3796.08 --> 3797.64]  the gospel sets you free.
[3798.32 --> 3799.84]  We don't have to follow
[3799.84 --> 3802.06]  all of these ceremonial laws.
[3802.88 --> 3804.12]  But he's also saying
[3804.12 --> 3805.52]  that there is a greater law
[3805.52 --> 3807.40]  that is in place
[3807.40 --> 3809.00]  that we do need to adhere to.
[3809.20 --> 3810.72]  It is the law of love.
[3811.58 --> 3813.00]  It's a law of caring
[3813.00 --> 3814.02]  for another person.
[3814.02 --> 3817.10]  And Paul is saying,
[3817.16 --> 3817.24]  you know,
[3817.30 --> 3817.98]  I don't want to put
[3817.98 --> 3819.20]  any obstacles
[3819.20 --> 3820.62]  in the place
[3820.62 --> 3821.62]  of another person
[3821.62 --> 3822.62]  coming to faith
[3822.62 --> 3823.50]  through Jesus Christ.
[3825.24 --> 3826.56]  And so what we have here
[3826.56 --> 3827.84]  is this incredible combination
[3827.84 --> 3829.98]  of both truth and love.
[3830.64 --> 3831.54]  On the one hand,
[3831.74 --> 3832.86]  we should be absolutely
[3832.86 --> 3834.20]  uncompromising
[3834.20 --> 3835.22]  when it comes to
[3835.22 --> 3836.40]  the truth of the gospel.
[3836.56 --> 3837.72]  We are saved by faith,
[3837.86 --> 3839.42]  not by any other requirement.
[3840.08 --> 3840.16]  Right?
[3840.24 --> 3842.32]  God loves you completely
[3842.32 --> 3845.04]  because of what Jesus has done,
[3845.10 --> 3845.96]  not because of anything
[3845.96 --> 3847.12]  you have to do
[3847.12 --> 3848.22]  or any requirements.
[3848.34 --> 3849.44]  It's not based on any of that.
[3850.34 --> 3851.04]  And we should have
[3851.04 --> 3851.84]  deep conviction
[3851.84 --> 3852.66]  about following
[3852.66 --> 3853.52]  the moral law
[3853.52 --> 3854.86]  that is unchanging
[3854.86 --> 3855.56]  and applies
[3855.56 --> 3856.46]  to all believers
[3856.46 --> 3857.74]  in all cultures.
[3858.28 --> 3859.44]  Things like sexual purity.
[3860.44 --> 3860.96]  But,
[3861.42 --> 3862.48]  we are called
[3862.48 --> 3863.24]  to practice
[3863.24 --> 3864.52]  gracious love
[3864.52 --> 3866.06]  when it comes
[3866.06 --> 3867.90]  to these non-essential
[3867.90 --> 3869.32]  cultural things
[3869.32 --> 3870.40]  like food.
[3872.04 --> 3873.14]  Here's what Martin Luther
[3873.14 --> 3874.02]  said about this.
[3875.28 --> 3875.58]  He said,
[3875.66 --> 3876.50]  the apostle Paul
[3876.50 --> 3878.02]  was strong in faith
[3878.02 --> 3879.76]  and soft in love.
[3880.34 --> 3881.48]  So concerning faith,
[3881.58 --> 3882.62]  we ought to be invincible
[3882.62 --> 3883.90]  and more hard
[3883.90 --> 3885.22]  than the most adamant stone.
[3885.84 --> 3887.06]  But as touching charity,
[3887.18 --> 3888.24]  we ought to be soft
[3888.24 --> 3889.40]  and more flexible
[3889.40 --> 3891.04]  than the reed or leaf
[3891.04 --> 3892.28]  that is shaken with the wind
[3892.28 --> 3894.28]  and ready to yield
[3894.28 --> 3895.48]  to everything.
[3895.48 --> 3898.22]  Wouldn't that be awesome
[3898.22 --> 3901.04]  if the church
[3901.04 --> 3903.00]  could be like that?
[3903.80 --> 3904.84]  Strong in the gospel,
[3905.92 --> 3907.76]  gracious in loving people
[3907.76 --> 3908.98]  and living the gospel out.
[3909.92 --> 3910.88]  Let me pray that God
[3910.88 --> 3911.84]  would help us to do that.
[3912.18 --> 3912.80]  Let's pray together.
[3914.58 --> 3915.54]  Lord, we thank you
[3915.54 --> 3916.56]  so much for your church.
[3917.20 --> 3917.88]  Lord, we thank you
[3917.88 --> 3918.70]  that you are gracious,
[3919.42 --> 3920.58]  that you are patient,
[3921.22 --> 3922.22]  that you are good.
[3923.08 --> 3924.58]  Father, you delight in us.
[3925.48 --> 3926.26]  And we thank you
[3926.26 --> 3926.82]  for the fact
[3926.82 --> 3928.48]  that you put church conflict
[3928.48 --> 3929.32]  right in the middle
[3929.32 --> 3929.82]  of the Bible
[3929.82 --> 3931.98]  and that we can learn from it.
[3932.08 --> 3932.42]  And so, Lord,
[3932.46 --> 3933.30]  would you teach us
[3933.30 --> 3935.78]  to have our identity in you?
[3936.78 --> 3937.08]  And Lord,
[3937.14 --> 3938.52]  teach us to carry out
[3938.52 --> 3939.46]  this practice
[3939.46 --> 3940.74]  of self-giving love
[3940.74 --> 3942.88]  that you carried out for us.
[3943.22 --> 3943.70]  And Lord,
[3943.74 --> 3944.54]  would you lead us,
[3944.62 --> 3944.92]  we pray,
[3945.00 --> 3945.56]  through Christ.
[3946.32 --> 3946.64]  Amen.
[3946.64 --> 3946.74]  Amen.
[3946.74 --> 3950.04]  All right.
[3950.50 --> 3951.04]  Thank you.
[3951.08 --> 3951.66]  I know that was kind of
[3951.66 --> 3954.06]  a Jews, Gentiles culture,
[3954.54 --> 3955.94]  a little bit challenging,
[3956.18 --> 3957.98]  but let's stand now
[3957.98 --> 3958.72]  and let's sing
[3958.72 --> 3959.70]  a song of response.
[3959.70 --> 3979.54]  Let us build a house
[3979.54 --> 3981.82]  where the Lord can dwell
[3981.82 --> 3986.32]  and all can save the end.
[3986.32 --> 3989.42]  A place where saints
[3989.42 --> 3991.62]  and children tell
[3991.62 --> 3993.66]  how the Lord's learn
[3993.66 --> 3996.06]  to forgive.
[3996.78 --> 3999.16]  And the hopes and dreams
[3999.16 --> 4001.16]  and visions
[4001.16 --> 4003.16]  from the faith
[4003.16 --> 4005.96]  and fault of grace.
[4006.56 --> 4009.04]  Hear the love of Christ
[4009.04 --> 4011.78]  shall end divisions.
[4012.30 --> 4014.36]  All are welcome,
[4014.74 --> 4016.94]  all are welcome,
[4017.32 --> 4019.34]  all are welcome
[4019.34 --> 4024.72]  in this place.
[4026.62 --> 4029.24]  Let us build a house
[4029.24 --> 4031.52]  where hands will reach
[4031.52 --> 4035.88]  beyond the wood and stone
[4035.88 --> 4039.02]  to heal and strengthen,
[4039.02 --> 4041.24]  and serve and teach,
[4041.44 --> 4043.82]  and live the world
[4043.82 --> 4045.58]  they've known.
[4046.24 --> 4048.14]  Hear the outcast
[4048.14 --> 4050.08]  and the stranger,
[4050.98 --> 4053.14]  there the image
[4053.14 --> 4055.58]  of God's face.
[4055.58 --> 4058.58]  Let us bring an end
[4058.58 --> 4061.28]  to fear and danger.
[4061.78 --> 4063.88]  All are welcome,
[4063.88 --> 4066.44]  all are welcome,
[4066.44 --> 4068.84]  all are welcome
[4068.84 --> 4073.96]  in this place.
[4075.42 --> 4078.62]  Let us build a house
[4078.62 --> 4080.86]  where all are named,
[4081.22 --> 4085.30]  better songs and visions heard,
[4085.84 --> 4088.96]  and loved and treasured,
[4089.04 --> 4090.54]  taught and played,
[4090.54 --> 4095.24]  that has words within the world.
[4095.68 --> 4098.10]  Built of tears and cries
[4098.10 --> 4099.54]  and laughter,
[4100.44 --> 4102.02]  prayers of faith
[4102.02 --> 4104.86]  and songs of grace.
[4104.86 --> 4107.50]  Let this house proclaim
[4107.50 --> 4110.48]  from far to after,
[4110.96 --> 4113.14]  all are welcome,
[4113.54 --> 4115.80]  all are welcome,
[4115.80 --> 4118.36]  all are welcome
[4118.36 --> 4122.36]  in this place.
[4122.36 --> 4124.36]  grace.
[4140.00 --> 4141.70]  So we will continue
[4141.70 --> 4142.54]  to worship the Lord
[4142.54 --> 4144.06]  by the giving of our tithes
[4144.06 --> 4144.68]  and our offerings.
[4145.10 --> 4146.24]  This is another way
[4146.24 --> 4147.54]  of responding to the fact
[4147.54 --> 4149.04]  that God has given us everything.
[4149.04 --> 4150.34]  He has given,
[4150.52 --> 4151.98]  He has held nothing back.
[4152.44 --> 4153.46]  And we are free
[4153.46 --> 4155.30]  to also then give back to Him
[4155.30 --> 4156.80]  to what He's doing
[4156.80 --> 4157.58]  in our church
[4157.58 --> 4158.32]  and what He's doing
[4158.32 --> 4159.04]  around the world.
[4159.54 --> 4161.14]  So today is a little bit unique
[4161.14 --> 4162.34]  in that we have two
[4162.34 --> 4164.28]  designated offerings.
[4164.52 --> 4164.82]  One,
[4165.32 --> 4166.40]  part of the regular schedule
[4166.40 --> 4167.24]  was for the Delta
[4167.24 --> 4168.64]  Christian School.
[4169.14 --> 4169.86]  And also,
[4169.96 --> 4170.62]  there's an opportunity
[4170.62 --> 4171.74]  that we want to give
[4171.74 --> 4174.08]  to give to the Canadian Red Cross.
[4174.14 --> 4174.78]  And this is a,
[4175.12 --> 4175.46]  you know,
[4175.56 --> 4176.98]  a work of the deacons
[4176.98 --> 4177.86]  to encourage
[4177.86 --> 4179.32]  our faithful giving,
[4179.88 --> 4182.18]  not only to our church,
[4182.24 --> 4184.00]  but also to others in need.
[4184.32 --> 4185.08]  And so I believe
[4185.08 --> 4185.92]  that you could,
[4186.04 --> 4186.96]  on your envelopes,
[4187.04 --> 4187.92]  just write down
[4187.92 --> 4188.68]  the designation,
[4188.92 --> 4189.40]  whether it's for
[4189.40 --> 4190.12]  Delta Christian School
[4190.12 --> 4191.62]  or Red Cross.
[4192.40 --> 4193.16]  And so,
[4193.60 --> 4194.40]  can I ask the deacons
[4194.40 --> 4195.20]  to come forward?
[4195.72 --> 4196.26]  And if deacons,
[4196.30 --> 4196.84]  you have any other
[4196.84 --> 4197.52]  further explanation,
[4197.72 --> 4198.46]  just come on up
[4198.46 --> 4199.36]  and give that.
[4199.36 --> 4199.42]  Thank you.
[4206.98 --> 4236.96]  Thank you.
[4236.98 --> 4237.98]  Thank you.
[4237.98 --> 4266.96]  Thank you.
[4266.98 --> 4267.98]  Thank you.
[4267.98 --> 4296.96]  Thank you.
[4296.98 --> 4297.98]  Thank you.
[4297.98 --> 4299.98]  Thank you.
[4299.98 --> 4303.98]  Thank you.
[4303.98 --> 4304.98]  Thank you.
[4310.98 --> 4311.98]  Thank you.
[4326.98 --> 4327.84]  All right.
[4327.84 --> 4329.60]  Let's join in prayer
[4329.60 --> 4332.00]  for our own church
[4332.00 --> 4332.86]  and for the world.
[4333.26 --> 4334.28]  Would you please pray with me?
[4338.74 --> 4339.92]  Our triune God,
[4340.04 --> 4340.34]  Father,
[4340.88 --> 4341.20]  Son,
[4341.26 --> 4342.02]  and Holy Spirit,
[4342.94 --> 4344.56]  you are the sovereign Lord.
[4345.12 --> 4346.44]  You are the King of Kings,
[4346.56 --> 4347.58]  the Lord of Lords.
[4348.70 --> 4349.18]  And Father,
[4349.30 --> 4350.58]  we come before you
[4350.58 --> 4353.58]  as just this one small part
[4353.58 --> 4357.42]  of your global body,
[4357.58 --> 4359.58]  people drawn from every tribe,
[4360.34 --> 4360.96]  every nation,
[4360.96 --> 4362.02]  every language.
[4363.10 --> 4363.88]  And Father,
[4364.16 --> 4364.38]  we,
[4365.58 --> 4367.24]  as your people,
[4367.40 --> 4367.54]  Lord,
[4367.62 --> 4370.28]  we pray for the unity
[4370.28 --> 4371.58]  and the mission of your church.
[4371.58 --> 4372.76]  Lord,
[4372.84 --> 4373.52]  we thank you
[4373.52 --> 4375.18]  that we do have fellowship
[4375.18 --> 4376.16]  with one another.
[4376.16 --> 4377.30]  and so,
[4377.42 --> 4377.54]  Lord,
[4377.60 --> 4378.26]  would you help us
[4378.26 --> 4379.58]  to expand our hearts
[4379.58 --> 4380.28]  and our minds,
[4380.38 --> 4381.18]  our imaginations,
[4381.28 --> 4382.44]  not only to think about
[4382.44 --> 4383.94]  who we are
[4383.94 --> 4385.66]  as Ladner CRC,
[4385.80 --> 4388.08]  as precious as that is to us,
[4388.16 --> 4388.94]  but also,
[4389.18 --> 4389.22]  Lord,
[4389.30 --> 4389.98]  to your church
[4389.98 --> 4390.66]  here in Ladner,
[4391.70 --> 4392.32]  in Vancouver,
[4392.60 --> 4394.14]  and really around the world.
[4394.58 --> 4394.82]  Lord,
[4394.86 --> 4395.98]  we pray for your church.
[4396.68 --> 4397.84]  We pray that
[4397.84 --> 4398.86]  you would
[4398.86 --> 4400.94]  gather more people
[4400.94 --> 4401.72]  into your church.
[4401.80 --> 4402.04]  And Lord,
[4402.10 --> 4403.08]  we pray that for us here.
[4403.08 --> 4403.88]  We pray that
[4403.88 --> 4405.22]  you would help us
[4405.22 --> 4406.78]  to be welcoming
[4406.78 --> 4407.48]  to our neighbors
[4407.48 --> 4408.64]  and all around us.
[4409.20 --> 4409.44]  And Lord,
[4409.50 --> 4410.26]  we pray that
[4410.26 --> 4411.10]  your Holy Spirit
[4411.10 --> 4412.34]  would be at work
[4412.34 --> 4413.56]  even among us.
[4414.20 --> 4414.48]  Lord,
[4414.52 --> 4415.04]  that you,
[4415.58 --> 4417.12]  through our faithful witness,
[4417.66 --> 4419.12]  would gather in our neighbors,
[4419.50 --> 4420.28]  that they would come
[4420.28 --> 4420.86]  to know
[4420.86 --> 4422.46]  the forgiveness of sins
[4422.46 --> 4423.26]  and the joy
[4423.26 --> 4424.64]  of knowing you.
[4425.56 --> 4425.88]  Lord,
[4425.92 --> 4426.60]  would that be
[4426.60 --> 4427.52]  the prayer
[4427.52 --> 4428.52]  of our hearts.
[4429.48 --> 4430.20]  And Lord,
[4430.20 --> 4431.00]  we also
[4431.00 --> 4433.04]  pray for
[4433.04 --> 4434.84]  many needs
[4434.84 --> 4435.36]  that we have
[4435.36 --> 4436.32]  in our own congregation.
[4437.20 --> 4437.44]  And Lord,
[4437.50 --> 4438.10]  as we think about
[4438.10 --> 4438.88]  our own members,
[4439.06 --> 4439.18]  Lord,
[4439.26 --> 4440.62]  we mourn
[4440.62 --> 4443.74]  John Van Tull's death.
[4445.02 --> 4445.48]  And Lord,
[4445.62 --> 4447.06]  you say in the book of Job
[4447.06 --> 4448.16]  that the Lord gives
[4448.16 --> 4449.30]  and the Lord takes away,
[4449.44 --> 4450.26]  blessed be the name
[4450.26 --> 4450.76]  of the Lord.
[4452.04 --> 4452.58]  And Lord,
[4452.66 --> 4453.18]  so we
[4453.18 --> 4454.88]  praise your name
[4454.88 --> 4455.50]  for John
[4455.50 --> 4456.96]  and what he has meant,
[4457.76 --> 4458.18]  of course,
[4458.18 --> 4458.80]  to Wilma
[4458.80 --> 4460.38]  and all of Van Tull's,
[4460.44 --> 4461.52]  but also to all of us.
[4462.38 --> 4462.66]  And Lord,
[4462.72 --> 4463.38]  we thank you
[4463.38 --> 4464.42]  that he is now
[4464.42 --> 4466.92]  in fullness of joy,
[4467.94 --> 4468.80]  fully alive,
[4469.80 --> 4470.90]  without sin,
[4471.28 --> 4471.96]  without pain,
[4472.50 --> 4473.40]  and that he is
[4473.40 --> 4474.02]  in your presence.
[4474.12 --> 4474.40]  And Lord,
[4474.44 --> 4474.86]  we thank you
[4474.86 --> 4475.50]  for the promise
[4475.50 --> 4476.22]  of resurrection
[4476.22 --> 4477.52]  that we will see him again.
[4478.12 --> 4478.46]  But Lord,
[4478.54 --> 4479.50]  even while we wait
[4479.50 --> 4480.02]  for that day,
[4480.10 --> 4481.00]  would you bring
[4481.00 --> 4482.60]  your arms
[4482.60 --> 4483.48]  and your comfort
[4483.48 --> 4484.54]  around Wilma
[4484.54 --> 4486.08]  and the Van Tull's.
[4486.08 --> 4487.34]  and Lord,
[4487.78 --> 4488.70]  for all of us
[4488.70 --> 4490.62]  as we miss John.
[4491.54 --> 4492.02]  Lord,
[4492.06 --> 4492.88]  we also pray
[4492.88 --> 4493.82]  for Ted,
[4493.90 --> 4495.58]  who is in Delta Hospital
[4495.58 --> 4496.42]  due to a fall.
[4497.08 --> 4497.42]  And Lord,
[4497.44 --> 4497.92]  we thank you
[4497.92 --> 4499.04]  that he is
[4499.04 --> 4500.54]  slowly getting better,
[4500.98 --> 4501.76]  that he wants
[4501.76 --> 4502.86]  to come back home.
[4503.42 --> 4503.60]  Lord,
[4503.64 --> 4504.50]  would you be with him
[4504.50 --> 4505.86]  and comfort his heart
[4505.86 --> 4507.06]  while he is in the hospital.
[4508.84 --> 4509.32]  Lord,
[4509.38 --> 4510.22]  we pray for
[4510.22 --> 4511.02]  Ellie Bixma,
[4511.16 --> 4511.90]  who is in the hospital
[4511.90 --> 4512.76]  after a fall
[4512.76 --> 4513.70]  on her arm,
[4513.74 --> 4514.12]  and we pray
[4514.12 --> 4515.12]  for her healing.
[4516.32 --> 4516.76]  And Lord,
[4516.96 --> 4517.48]  also,
[4517.86 --> 4518.68]  we pray for Tony,
[4519.16 --> 4519.94]  who is at home.
[4520.14 --> 4521.06]  And Lord,
[4521.10 --> 4521.58]  we thank you
[4521.58 --> 4524.30]  that there are reports
[4524.30 --> 4525.82]  that he is getting better.
[4525.96 --> 4526.10]  Lord,
[4526.16 --> 4527.60]  we pray for his full recovery.
[4528.70 --> 4529.64]  We pray for Annette
[4529.64 --> 4530.56]  as she continues
[4530.56 --> 4531.08]  to recover
[4531.08 --> 4532.18]  from her foot operation.
[4532.96 --> 4533.80]  And for Amy,
[4534.04 --> 4535.08]  who is at home
[4535.08 --> 4535.50]  continuing
[4535.50 --> 4537.32]  to receive chemo treatments.
[4538.10 --> 4538.28]  Lord,
[4538.36 --> 4539.12]  would you give her
[4539.80 --> 4541.40]  also your special grace
[4541.40 --> 4543.00]  in your peace
[4543.00 --> 4545.28]  that lifts up
[4545.28 --> 4545.76]  her heart
[4545.76 --> 4546.32]  to you
[4546.32 --> 4547.84]  in full trust
[4547.84 --> 4549.66]  of your love
[4549.66 --> 4550.02]  for her.
[4551.52 --> 4552.00]  Lord,
[4552.08 --> 4552.42]  we
[4552.42 --> 4555.68]  live in a broken world
[4555.68 --> 4557.40]  and we continue
[4557.40 --> 4558.42]  to wait
[4558.42 --> 4559.14]  for your kingdom
[4559.14 --> 4559.70]  to come
[4559.70 --> 4560.46]  in all of its fullness.
[4561.36 --> 4562.04]  We continue
[4562.04 --> 4562.44]  to wait
[4562.44 --> 4563.06]  when all things
[4563.06 --> 4563.56]  are renewed.
[4564.56 --> 4565.28]  All people
[4565.28 --> 4566.22]  are called
[4566.22 --> 4566.90]  by your name
[4566.90 --> 4568.14]  from every tribe,
[4568.22 --> 4568.38]  tongue,
[4568.46 --> 4568.88]  and nation
[4568.88 --> 4569.86]  for when they
[4569.86 --> 4570.96]  will be gathered together
[4570.96 --> 4571.88]  around your throne
[4571.88 --> 4572.64]  and we join
[4572.64 --> 4574.22]  the church victorious,
[4574.48 --> 4575.40]  the church triumphant
[4575.40 --> 4576.18]  who is already
[4576.18 --> 4577.00]  in your presence.
[4577.52 --> 4578.28]  And all of us
[4578.28 --> 4578.64]  together,
[4578.84 --> 4579.00]  Lord,
[4579.86 --> 4581.02]  experience the fellowship
[4581.02 --> 4582.70]  for which you have
[4582.70 --> 4583.46]  died
[4583.46 --> 4584.26]  and for which you
[4584.26 --> 4585.28]  are knitting us together.
[4586.42 --> 4587.12]  And Holy Spirit,
[4587.22 --> 4588.04]  help us to remember,
[4588.76 --> 4588.86]  Lord,
[4588.94 --> 4589.50]  that the body
[4589.50 --> 4590.02]  is made up
[4590.02 --> 4591.24]  of many different parts.
[4591.84 --> 4592.68]  Each one of us
[4592.68 --> 4593.76]  unique and necessary.
[4594.70 --> 4595.52]  And help us
[4595.52 --> 4596.18]  to embrace
[4596.18 --> 4598.02]  also this comfort
[4598.02 --> 4600.52]  that comes
[4600.52 --> 4601.62]  from that diversity
[4601.62 --> 4603.14]  and to celebrate
[4603.14 --> 4603.58]  the fact
[4603.58 --> 4604.52]  that we are united
[4604.52 --> 4605.50]  even though we share
[4605.50 --> 4606.14]  different cultures
[4606.14 --> 4606.68]  and backgrounds.
[4606.88 --> 4607.56]  And as we seek
[4607.56 --> 4609.10]  to live that out
[4609.10 --> 4609.98]  even in our own
[4609.98 --> 4610.80]  church fellowship,
[4611.86 --> 4612.14]  Lord,
[4612.18 --> 4613.04]  would you help us
[4613.04 --> 4614.26]  to practice
[4614.26 --> 4615.12]  the ways of love.
[4616.06 --> 4617.40]  And we do all of this
[4617.40 --> 4619.48]  because you showed
[4619.48 --> 4620.06]  your love
[4620.06 --> 4621.22]  first to us
[4621.22 --> 4623.40]  through your own
[4623.40 --> 4624.02]  sacrifice,
[4624.28 --> 4624.80]  the blood of our
[4624.80 --> 4625.58]  Lord Jesus Christ.
[4625.58 --> 4627.18]  We pray all of this
[4627.18 --> 4628.00]  in Jesus' name.
[4628.70 --> 4629.00]  Amen.
[4632.24 --> 4632.68]  So,
[4632.90 --> 4633.86]  please join us
[4633.86 --> 4634.54]  for a time
[4634.54 --> 4635.12]  of fellowship
[4635.12 --> 4636.52]  in the fellowship hall
[4636.52 --> 4637.16]  through the doors
[4637.16 --> 4637.94]  right after the service.
[4638.14 --> 4639.26]  I invite you to stand.
[4639.82 --> 4640.46]  Go ahead and stand
[4640.46 --> 4641.60]  and we will go out
[4641.60 --> 4642.42]  with God's blessing
[4642.42 --> 4643.12]  upon us
[4643.12 --> 4644.88]  and then we will
[4644.88 --> 4645.68]  sing our final song
[4645.68 --> 4646.06]  together.
[4646.22 --> 4646.66]  So I invite you
[4646.66 --> 4647.44]  to hold out your hands
[4647.44 --> 4647.96]  as a gesture
[4647.96 --> 4649.04]  of receiving God's blessing.
[4649.68 --> 4650.16]  And this comes
[4650.16 --> 4651.50]  from Ephesians chapter 6.
[4652.18 --> 4653.16]  Peace to the brothers
[4653.16 --> 4653.80]  and sisters
[4653.80 --> 4655.22]  and love
[4655.22 --> 4656.04]  with faith
[4656.04 --> 4657.42]  from God the Father
[4657.42 --> 4658.96]  and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4659.36 --> 4660.10]  Grace to all
[4660.10 --> 4661.60]  who love our Lord Jesus Christ
[4661.60 --> 4663.14]  with an undying love.
[4663.78 --> 4664.02]  Amen.
[4664.02 --> 4664.12]  Amen.
[4664.12 --> 4685.96]  My friends, may you grow in grace
[4685.96 --> 4688.12]  and in the knowledge
[4688.12 --> 4691.20]  of our Lord and Savior.
[4691.20 --> 4698.72]  My friends, may you grow in grace
[4698.72 --> 4700.34]  and in the knowledge
[4700.34 --> 4704.96]  of Jesus Christ.
[4704.96 --> 4708.54]  To God be the glory
[4708.54 --> 4711.54]  Now and forever
[4711.54 --> 4714.66]  Now and forever
[4714.66 --> 4715.96]  Amen.
[4718.16 --> 4721.34]  To God be the glory
[4721.34 --> 4724.34]  Now and forever
[4724.34 --> 4727.60]  Now and forever
[4727.60 --> 4728.94]  Amen.
[4728.94 --> 4729.48]  Amen.
[4734.96 --> 4748.58]  Old man
[4748.58 --> 4750.58]  Amen.
[4778.58 --> 4780.58]  Amen.
[4808.58 --> 4810.58]  Amen.
