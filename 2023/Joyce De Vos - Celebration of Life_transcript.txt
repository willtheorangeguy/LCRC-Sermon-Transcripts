[2038.34 --> 2044.26]  mom also bravely scared off black bears who came around searching for an easy meal. I still remember
[2044.26 --> 2049.86]  that, Michael do you remember that? I don't know, that sort of banging pans and you know,
[2050.42 --> 2056.02]  sending off the bears who would just look at her, you know, confused, what is this lady doing?
[2057.86 --> 2067.14]  On July 5th, 1960, Frank was born. A year later, Norm was born on May 12th and we were a family of six.
[2068.34 --> 2078.34]  But in June of 1966, Frank was diagnosed with leukemia and at only six months old, he passed away a month later.
[2079.54 --> 2084.50]  In his diaries, again, dad expressed great admiration for the way mom kept it together,
[2085.22 --> 2090.74]  trusted in God's providence and moved forward in the face of this tragedy. In later years, she used to
[2090.74 --> 2096.50]  say to me that the pain of that loss never went away, just became easier to bear with time.
[2099.54 --> 2105.46]  And then on March 23rd, 1969, I joined the family and we were six again, six biological children that is.
[2105.46 --> 2111.70]  Mom and dad also welcomed many other kids into our home over the years for short-term or longer-term
[2111.70 --> 2116.74]  stays. Marilyn, I don't know if Marilyn is listening or watching, she is? That's wonderful.
[2116.74 --> 2121.54]  How great to have you with us, Marilyn. Became a member of the family for many years and to this
[2121.54 --> 2129.94]  day still called mom, mom, her mom. Years later, when I was only seven, Michael joined the family as well.
[2132.50 --> 2139.62]  In 1973, 74, dad's dream to build his own house on Patton Drive came true. That was a big thing for him.
[2139.62 --> 2143.38]  I remember telling him that it was all going to fall down because he was building it on sand.
[2144.10 --> 2151.38]  Because I knew that, the Bible told me that. Yeah. It was from that home that most of the kids flew the
[2151.38 --> 2157.22]  coop as they left and got married. Mom sewed the wedding dresses, the bridesmaid dresses, the flower
[2157.22 --> 2163.46]  girls, her own dresses for each wedding. Before long, the house on Patton Drive began to fill with the
[2163.46 --> 2170.26]  sound of the hound. Sound of grandchildren. In 1981, dad was diagnosed with cancer. He fought hard.
[2171.14 --> 2176.98]  And in 1982, mom and he had a chance to go to Holland for one last time. But the following year, dad passed away.
[2178.10 --> 2186.26]  Mom was now a widow. But again, as when Frank passed away, mom trusted in God, pushed forward, undaunted.
[2186.26 --> 2192.82]  She continued to care for Norm and Michael and I. She worked tirelessly with the physically and mentally
[2192.82 --> 2199.14]  challenged through the Bethesda Christian Association. She continued to work with the Ladies Aid Society,
[2199.14 --> 2206.18]  Sunflowers. She ran crafting workshops with seniors in long-term care. She made literally hundreds of
[2206.18 --> 2213.30]  teddy bears for children who were in counseling for trauma. Many of these people never knew mom and yet
[2213.30 --> 2219.62]  felt her love. When she turned 65, ironically enough, she decided to go out and get her first job.
[2222.42 --> 2229.54]  Working in a sewing store here in Ladner with Pam. There she taught sewing and crafting classes.
[2231.22 --> 2236.34]  Later, when most of us had left home, she moved to a smaller house on Tidewater Bay, which many of the
[2236.34 --> 2243.22]  grandchildren probably remember best. During those years, mom loved to take long drives to visit
[2243.22 --> 2251.62]  family in Alberta, in northern BC. She loved going to the thrift store, looking for bargains. She loved our
[2251.62 --> 2257.70]  yearly family camp at Cultus Lake. Always looked forward to that. She loved cycling around town on her
[2257.70 --> 2263.30]  groovy yellow coaster bike, which she called her love bike because it was a gift from her family.
[2264.98 --> 2268.90]  From her house on Tidewater Bay, she chose to move to Augustine House,
[2268.90 --> 2276.42]  where she loved her independence there and all the new friends and the support staff. And when the time
[2276.42 --> 2283.30]  came, it was hard to leave Augustine and to... but the staff at Peace Portal and later Kin Village welcomed
[2283.30 --> 2291.14]  her and took great care of her. And each of them was a gift from God to her and to our family. Mom lived
[2291.14 --> 2299.22]  faithfully, industriously, joyfully. She was a practical person who viewed her material possessions
[2299.22 --> 2306.34]  as transient, either useful or unnecessary. That was one of the big words with her, that is unnecessary.
[2306.34 --> 2313.62]  You know? Yeah. She was fiercely independent. She had little patience for people who complained or moaned
[2313.62 --> 2319.22]  about how things used to be better. Mom did not spend her energies looking back. She was always looking
[2319.22 --> 2325.94]  forward, always trying to do the next good thing. She blessed and inspired me, my family, countless
[2325.94 --> 2334.34]  others, many of whom never even knew her. She always exemplified to me a life well lived. She was a
[2334.34 --> 2347.06]  marvelous woman and I, we, all of us, will miss her terribly.
[2347.06 --> 2372.50]  So this is a song that we would always sing for Omo whenever the four of us went to go visit her in
[2372.50 --> 2380.18]  carol. And this was one that she always knew the words to, even when she had lost so many of other
[2380.82 --> 2385.22]  memories and everything. She just always knew the words to this song. So this one's quite special to us.
[2385.22 --> 2397.22]  Off' class.
[2399.22 --> 2401.94]  Yeah.
[2401.94 --> 2404.60]  Oh, my soul.
[2404.60 --> 2406.82]  Oh, my soul.
[2406.82 --> 2410.98]  Worship His holy name.
[2412.26 --> 2415.84]  Sing like never before.
[2415.84 --> 2424.02]  Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2428.34 --> 2436.22]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[2436.22 --> 2442.10]  It's time to sing your song again.
[2442.10 --> 2449.10]  Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,
[2450.70 --> 2457.10]  let me be singing when the evening comes.
[2457.10 --> 2468.98]  Let the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2468.98 --> 2473.86]  Worship His holy name.
[2474.86 --> 2478.74]  Sing like never before.
[2479.54 --> 2486.66]  Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2486.66 --> 2498.66]  I'm rich in love and your soul to anger.
[2498.66 --> 2504.88]  Your name is great and your heart is kind.
[2505.54 --> 2511.98]  For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[2511.98 --> 2520.86]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[2520.86 --> 2530.74]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2530.74 --> 2536.84]  Worship His holy name.
[2536.84 --> 2541.52]  Sing like never before.
[2541.52 --> 2549.46]  Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2549.46 --> 2555.34]  Sing like never before.
[2555.34 --> 2561.34]  And on that day when my strength is failing,
[2561.34 --> 2567.22]  The end draws near and my time has come.
[2567.22 --> 2575.22]  Still my soul will sing Your praise unending.
[2575.22 --> 2582.22]  Ten thousand years and then forever more.
[2582.22 --> 2588.10]  Ten thousand years and then forever more.
[2588.10 --> 2594.10]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2594.10 --> 2599.10]  Worship His holy name.
[2599.10 --> 2604.10]  Sing like never before.
[2604.10 --> 2612.10]  Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2612.10 --> 2617.98]  Oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2617.98 --> 2627.88]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[2627.88 --> 2632.98]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2632.98 --> 2635.48]  Worship His holy name.
[2635.48 --> 2638.56]  Sing like never before.
[2638.56 --> 2640.66]  Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2640.66 --> 2646.62]  Oh, I'll worship your holy name.
[2647.18 --> 2651.86]  Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[2659.30 --> 2661.98]  And for these next ones, we'll just invite you to stand with us.
[2670.66 --> 2700.64]  Thank you.
[2700.66 --> 2706.50]  Thank you.
[2706.50 --> 2710.94]  Great are you, Lord.

[3215.94 --> 3226.50]  I'm Nathan, Oma's grandson.
[3227.18 --> 3233.26]  It's an honor for me to be reading from this Bible from Oma and Opa, an old King James
[3233.26 --> 3234.28]  version.
[3234.28 --> 3240.66]  I know that Oma is looking down on me as I read this because she had this psalm memorized.
[3242.14 --> 3244.70]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[3244.70 --> 3246.46]  I shall not want.
[3247.42 --> 3250.14]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[3251.02 --> 3253.92]  He leadeth me beside quiet waters.
[3255.14 --> 3257.10]  He restoreth my soul.
[3258.24 --> 3263.16]  He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake.
[3264.64 --> 3270.02]  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[3270.02 --> 3272.84]  For thou art with me.
[3273.62 --> 3276.76]  Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[3278.46 --> 3282.06]  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[3282.90 --> 3284.68]  Thou anointest my head with oil.
[3285.60 --> 3287.28]  My cup runneth over.
[3288.78 --> 3294.00]  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[3294.00 --> 3298.82]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[3299.94 --> 3300.46]  Amen.
[3300.46 --> 3300.56]  Amen.
[3300.56 --> 3320.50]  Good afternoon.
[3320.50 --> 3321.44]  My name is Norm.
[3322.00 --> 3323.10]  Joyce is my mum.
[3323.10 --> 3328.14]  So we came here today to remember and to celebrate mum's life on earth.
[3328.78 --> 3331.98]  And why do we celebrate when someone so dear to us is taken away?
[3332.86 --> 3337.12]  We celebrate even in the face of death because of the promises of our Lord Jesus.
[3337.38 --> 3340.08]  Promises that death is not the end but just the beginning.
[3340.80 --> 3343.26]  We believe that eternal life changes everything.
[3343.26 --> 3348.50]  But that life eternal that mum is experiencing now started over 90 years ago.
[3349.18 --> 3353.82]  And about 70 years ago, mum and dad met in Holland and committed to be together until death depart.
[3354.54 --> 3358.48]  At that time, their wedding text, as was mentioned earlier, was selected from the book of Genesis.
[3359.34 --> 3362.08]  Genesis 12, the first few verses.
[3362.08 --> 3366.74]  But God calls and promised to Abraham and Sarai.
[3367.50 --> 3376.30]  Just like mum and dad, Abraham and Sarai were being called to leave their home country and go to a land far away.
[3377.22 --> 3385.40]  In the early 1950s, when mum and dad got married, leaving to go far away from home across the Atlantic Ocean meant probably not seeing family ever again.
[3385.40 --> 3392.64]  But mum and dad left Holland and went to Canada with the trust that God would be faithful in his promises.
[3392.98 --> 3398.00]  The promises found in Genesis 12 verses 1 through 3 read as this.
[3398.70 --> 3406.50]  The Lord said to Abraham, leave your country, your people, your father's household and go to the land I will show you.
[3407.10 --> 3410.00]  And I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you.
[3410.32 --> 3414.38]  And I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.
[3414.38 --> 3420.82]  I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse and all the peoples of the earth will be blessed through you.
[3421.64 --> 3427.34]  And then verse 5 says, he took his wife Sarai and all their possessions they had accumulated and set out.
[3427.88 --> 3429.54]  And mum and dad did just that.
[3430.04 --> 3434.36]  They set out to Canada and were a blessing, were blessed in so many ways.
[3434.82 --> 3439.20]  They were blessed with children, friends, family and a great community around them.
[3439.20 --> 3443.94]  And out of thankfulness for those blessings, they were a blessing to those who they encountered.
[3445.02 --> 3451.00]  But for mum, we know that this being a blessing thing started long before she met dad, before they got married.
[3452.00 --> 3460.08]  Mum, as Brent had spoke about, was a blessing to the Jewish community at the age of 14 in her fearless work in the underground resistance in the Second World War.
[3460.08 --> 3468.28]  She comforted and kept safe many children with her help who were being smuggled away from certain death.
[3469.00 --> 3476.32]  Mum also told me that she often prayed with resistance soldiers before they went out on military mission trips.
[3477.34 --> 3480.36]  Mum's desire to follow Jesus poured into all her encounters.
[3480.36 --> 3488.94]  It was through her service that others often who barely knew her, that these people in their communities were blessed in life-changing ways.
[3489.44 --> 3491.04]  Now back to the west coast of Canada.
[3491.76 --> 3495.20]  Mum never lost her will to make time for me a blessing for others.
[3495.94 --> 3500.32]  She took time, took care of many children that were not hers over the years,
[3500.48 --> 3504.20]  whether through child-minding of people from church or caring for foster children.
[3504.86 --> 3506.30]  She treated and loved them as her own.
[3507.02 --> 3508.84]  What a great example of a servant heart.
[3508.84 --> 3512.98]  She blessed many young girls in Ladner through the sunflower ministry.
[3513.58 --> 3515.70]  I remember being with Mum once in a grocery store,
[3516.36 --> 3521.22]  and a middle-aged woman came up to Mum and asked her if she used to run the sunflowers.
[3521.86 --> 3528.02]  Mum said yes, and the woman took some time to explain how that experience had changed her life forever.
[3528.98 --> 3531.24]  I looked at my mum a little differently after that.
[3531.38 --> 3535.74]  It was kind of a blessing for me to see that the community as a whole was being blessed by Mum.
[3535.74 --> 3540.14]  So why tend to spend so much time telling these stories?
[3540.30 --> 3544.70]  Why reflect on a life that has moved on to much better times in Heaven?
[3545.34 --> 3547.82]  It's times like this that we celebrate God's faithfulness.
[3547.96 --> 3549.34]  God's faithfulness to Mum and Dad.
[3550.20 --> 3553.06]  God kept His promises that was made 70 years ago,
[3553.14 --> 3557.94]  when two young people got married and left everything they knew to put their trust in God to bless them.
[3557.94 --> 3562.10]  And He did bless them with a clan of 50 who are sitting here right today.
[3562.90 --> 3568.74]  And even more impactful is that they were a blessing to many people beyond the immediate family sitting here today.
[3569.40 --> 3570.76]  So where does this leave us?
[3571.44 --> 3575.48]  I would say that Mum would challenge us all to take up the same torch
[3575.48 --> 3580.66]  and let the Lord Jesus' grace come into our lives and let it be a blessing to us.
[3581.38 --> 3583.62]  With much thankfulness for the grace given us,
[3583.84 --> 3587.78]  which would be a blessing to others, even beyond our close friends and family.
[3588.62 --> 3591.92]  We would be a people of grace for those around us, a people of reconciliation.
[3592.96 --> 3599.90]  Mum understood that she could live a content life in spite of many hardships that she experienced through her life.
[3599.90 --> 3604.64]  She could live in the comfort of knowing that whether in this earthly life or in her death,
[3604.80 --> 3607.74]  everything that was important to her was in the hands of her Savior.
[3608.68 --> 3612.54]  And as I reflect back in that comfort that Mum taught me in life and in death,
[3612.66 --> 3617.20]  it brought me and Ingrid, my wife, through Ingrid's fight with cancer and passing to heaven.
[3619.28 --> 3623.16]  Mum's hope has always been that we find that comfort as well.
[3623.68 --> 3627.94]  She would profess that what a friend she had in Jesus, as we sang earlier.
[3627.94 --> 3631.36]  We all say, I think we all can say,
[3631.58 --> 3635.42]  thank you, Lord Jesus, for the example Mum gave us while she was with us.
[3635.80 --> 3639.78]  We know that she's now in the Lord's loving arms because of her faith in Jesus.
[3640.38 --> 3641.98]  Well done, Mum. Well done.
[3642.42 --> 3644.04]  We are proud of you. Amen.
[3644.30 --> 3645.06]  So let it be.
[3645.78 --> 3647.20]  We have so much to be thankful for.
[3647.20 --> 3647.32]  Thank you.
[3657.94 --> 3666.94]  I invite you to rise again, if you are able, and sing a few songs.
[3666.94 --> 3688.58]  O Lord my God,
[3688.58 --> 3706.58]  I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
[3706.58 --> 3708.32]  How great you are.
[3708.32 --> 3721.86]  And sing my soul, my Savior, God, to thee.
[3721.86 --> 3725.86]  How great thou art.
[3726.16 --> 3729.32]  How great thou art.
[3729.32 --> 3736.38]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[3736.38 --> 3744.12]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3744.12 --> 3750.86]  And when I think that God his Son not swearing
[3750.86 --> 3758.20]  Sent him to die, I scarce can't take it in
[3758.20 --> 3765.88]  That on the cross I wouldn't gladly bear him
[3765.88 --> 3772.78]  He bled and died to take away my sin
[3772.78 --> 3779.94]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[3779.94 --> 3787.00]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3787.00 --> 3793.68]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[3793.68 --> 3800.68]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3800.68 --> 3808.36]  When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
[3808.36 --> 3816.36]  And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
[3816.36 --> 3823.04]  Then I shall bow in humble adoration
[3823.04 --> 3830.04]  And there proclaim, my God how great thou art
[3830.04 --> 3838.72]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[3838.72 --> 3845.72]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3845.72 --> 3852.40]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[3852.40 --> 3859.40]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3859.40 --> 3863.08]  How great thou art
[3863.08 --> 3871.76]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[3871.76 --> 3893.44]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[3893.44 --> 3900.12]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[3900.12 --> 3901.12]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[3901.12 --> 3908.12]  That saved a wretch like me
[3908.12 --> 3916.80]  I once was lost, but now I'm found
[3916.80 --> 3922.80]  Was blind, but now I see
[3922.80 --> 3931.48]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[3931.48 --> 3937.48]  And grace my fears relieved
[3937.48 --> 3944.48]  How precious did that grace appear
[3944.48 --> 3951.16]  The hour I first believed
[3951.16 --> 3957.16]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[3957.16 --> 3964.16]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[3964.16 --> 3971.16]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[3971.16 --> 3979.84]  Unending love, amazing grace
[3979.84 --> 3988.84]  The Lord has promised earth to me
[3988.84 --> 3994.84]  His word my hope secures
[3994.84 --> 4003.52]  He will, He will, my shield and portion be
[4003.52 --> 4004.18]  He will, my shield and portion be
[4004.18 --> 4009.48]  As long as life endures
[4009.48 --> 4015.52]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[4015.52 --> 4022.64]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[4022.64 --> 4029.64]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[4029.64 --> 4036.12]  Unending love, amazing grace
[4036.12 --> 4042.36]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[4042.36 --> 4048.64]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[4048.64 --> 4055.64]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[4055.64 --> 4063.64]  Unending love, amazing grace
[4063.64 --> 4073.64]  The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
[4073.64 --> 4080.64]  The sun for e'er to shine
[4080.64 --> 4087.64]  But God, who called me here below
[4087.64 --> 4093.64]  Will be forever mine
[4093.64 --> 4100.64]  Will be forever mine
[4100.64 --> 4107.64]  You are forever mine
[4107.64 --> 4109.64]  You are forever mine
[4109.64 --> 4113.64]  You may be seated
[4113.64 --> 4124.64]  This time I would ask Bart and Adriana to come forward
[4124.64 --> 4127.78]  But before that, I was remiss
[4127.78 --> 4130.96]  That Daryl and Andrea and Michaela also came from Alberta
[4130.96 --> 4132.18]  Sorry about that
[4132.18 --> 4134.48]  There was probably other people I've missed along the way
[4134.64 --> 4136.74]  But Bart and Adriana are going to close
[4136.74 --> 4137.74]  We're going to sing a song
[4137.74 --> 4139.74]  And then please join us afterwards
[4139.74 --> 4140.74]  In the fellowship hall
[4140.74 --> 4163.74]  Let's come to the Lord our God
[4163.74 --> 4170.74]  Heavenly Father, we come to you at the end of this service of remembrance
[4170.74 --> 4175.74]  And we thank you for the time together here with friends and family
[4175.74 --> 4180.74]  So that we could hear and share stories about Joyce
[4180.74 --> 4183.74]  Your child and our sister in the Lord
[4183.74 --> 4189.74]  Lord, you have been her dwelling place throughout Joyce
[4189.74 --> 4194.74]  And also the toil and trouble in her life
[4194.74 --> 4197.74]  Establish now the work of her hands
[4197.74 --> 4202.74]  Grant us the joy of knowing that she is safe with you
[4202.74 --> 4204.74]  Comfort those who mourn
[4204.74 --> 4208.74]  And bless us as we continue the work of remembrance
[4208.74 --> 4212.74]  And of comforting and encouraging each other in the fellowship hall
[4212.74 --> 4218.74]  Finally, Lord, we want to thank you again for the gift that Joyce has been
[4218.74 --> 4225.74]  For her family, for this community, and for all who have come to know her
[4225.74 --> 4230.74]  Thank you, Lord, for this time together as family and friends
[4230.74 --> 4232.74]  And as we leave on our way home
[4232.74 --> 4236.74]  We pray that you, Lord, support us in this troubled life
[4236.74 --> 4240.74]  Until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes
[4240.74 --> 4245.74]  When the busy world is hushed and our work is done
[4245.74 --> 4250.74]  Then, Lord, in your mercy grant us to a safe lodging
[4250.74 --> 4253.74]  And peace at last through Jesus our Lord
[4253.74 --> 4257.74]  Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
[4257.74 --> 4260.74]  And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all
[4260.74 --> 4262.74]  Amen
[4290.74 --> 4302.74]  Praise God, from whom all blessings flow
[4302.74 --> 4309.74]  Praise Him, all creatures here below
[4309.74 --> 4317.74]  Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
[4317.74 --> 4332.74]  Praise God, from whom all blessings flow
[4332.74 --> 4338.74]  Praise Him, all creatures here below
[4338.74 --> 4341.74]  Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
[4341.74 --> 4345.74]  Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
[4345.74 --> 4351.74]  Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
[4351.74 --> 4355.74]  Amen
[4355.74 --> 4359.74]  Amen
[4359.74 --> 4364.74]  Amen
[4389.74 --> 4395.74]  Amen
[4396.74 --> 4404.74]  Amen
[4405.74 --> 4406.74]  Amen
[4406.74 --> 4408.74]  Amen
[4408.74 --> 4409.74]  Amen
[4409.74 --> 4410.74] ologist
[4419.74 --> 4421.74]  Amen.
[4449.74 --> 4451.74]  Amen.
[4479.74 --> 4481.74]  Amen.
[4509.74 --> 4511.74]  Amen.
