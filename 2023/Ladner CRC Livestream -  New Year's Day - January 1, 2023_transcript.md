[285.00 --> 286.00]  Good morning.
[286.00 --> 287.00]  Good morning.
[287.00 --> 291.00]  Very blessed New Year to all of you.
[291.00 --> 294.00]  How many of you stayed up until midnight?
[294.00 --> 298.00]  Pretty good, pretty good.
[298.00 --> 304.00]  I just barely made it and then midnight, that was it, and went to bed.
[304.00 --> 309.00]  But, and slept through my alarm this morning, which is very, very stressful.
[309.00 --> 311.00]  But we're here, glad to see all of you.
[311.00 --> 313.00]  I'm here, that's good.
[313.00 --> 315.00]  And we are here to worship the Lord this morning.
[315.00 --> 317.00]  So welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[317.00 --> 324.00]  Especially if you are joining us new today, we welcome you and we're glad that you are here joining with us.
[324.00 --> 329.00]  Just two brief announcements before we begin our time of worship.
[329.00 --> 335.00]  The first is, in our bulletin we often have the birthdays listed.
[335.00 --> 339.00]  And today is Jerry Cron's 97?
[339.00 --> 341.00]  Joe, is that right?
[341.00 --> 343.00]  97th birthday.
[343.00 --> 347.00]  So, if you get a chance, wish him a happy birthday.
[347.00 --> 354.00]  The second announcement is that in your bulletin you will find this bookmark.
[354.00 --> 359.00]  And this is some Bible readings that you can do every day.
[359.00 --> 367.00]  The New Year, of course, is a great time to resolve, to draw closer to God.
[367.00 --> 372.00]  And one of the most important ways that we do that is through reading God's Word.
[372.00 --> 377.00]  And so, this Bible reading plan follows, well what is a plan?
[377.00 --> 381.00]  Every day it gives you a psalm to read, one psalm.
[381.00 --> 385.00]  Then one portion from the Old Testament and one portion from the New Testament.
[385.00 --> 392.00]  And over the course of three years, it's not a, I don't do the read the Bible in a year plan.
[392.00 --> 395.00]  I've just, it's too much for me.
[395.00 --> 397.00]  So, if you can do that, that's great.
[397.00 --> 400.00]  If you also can't, you can take some consolation and also that.
[400.00 --> 402.00]  I don't.
[402.00 --> 407.00]  But over three years, this plan enables you to read the Old Testament through once,
[407.00 --> 409.00]  and then the New Testament every year.
[409.00 --> 411.00]  So, I think it's a really nice balance.
[411.00 --> 416.00]  And on Sundays, it follows the Revised Common Lectionary,
[416.00 --> 420.00]  which is kind of the Bible reading plan that most of the world uses.
[420.00 --> 424.00]  So, I encourage you to consider using this as a way to read the Bible this year.
[424.00 --> 427.00]  If you have your own way to read the Bible, be in God's Word, that's great.
[427.00 --> 428.00]  Don't change it.
[428.00 --> 431.00]  But if you don't, I recommend this.
[431.00 --> 433.00]  And it's fun if we can all do it together.
[433.00 --> 441.00]  So, with that, let us prepare our hearts to worship the Lord on this first day of the year.
[441.00 --> 447.00]  And I can't think of any better way to kick off the year than to gather as God's people and to worship Him together.
[447.00 --> 452.00]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 34.
[452.00 --> 454.00]  And let's read it responsibly.
[454.00 --> 458.00]  I will extol the Lord at all times.
[458.00 --> 461.00]  His praise will always be on my lips.
[461.00 --> 464.00]  I will glory in the Lord.
[464.00 --> 467.00]  Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
[467.00 --> 470.00]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[470.00 --> 473.00]  Let us exalt His name together.
[473.00 --> 476.00]  I sought the Lord and He answered me.
[476.00 --> 480.00]  He delivered me from all my fears.
[480.00 --> 483.00]  Those who look to Him are radiant.
[483.00 --> 487.00]  Their faces are never covered with shame.
[487.00 --> 491.00]  This poor man called and the Lord heard him.
[491.00 --> 495.00]  He saved him out of all his troubles.
[495.00 --> 498.00]  Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[498.00 --> 501.00]  Let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[501.00 --> 502.00]  God of joy.
[502.00 --> 504.00]  God of celebration.
[504.00 --> 507.00]  God of love and mercy.
[507.00 --> 510.00]  God of peace and righteousness.
[510.00 --> 512.00]  We worship you.
[512.00 --> 515.00]  You are the ruler of all worlds.
[515.00 --> 518.00]  You are the shepherd of creation.
[518.00 --> 523.00]  Because Jesus Christ has entered our world.
[523.00 --> 527.00]  Our Savior and King has come into the world.
[527.00 --> 528.00]  Not in power.
[528.00 --> 529.00]  Not in might.
[529.00 --> 531.00]  But in tenderness and love.
[531.00 --> 534.00]  So Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[534.00 --> 536.00]  Meet with us this morning we pray.
[536.00 --> 538.00]  On this first day of the new year.
[538.00 --> 543.00]  And help us to worship you with glad and believing hearts.
[543.00 --> 546.00]  Open our ears and our eyes.
[546.00 --> 550.00]  This morning to see and to Savior our Lord Jesus Christ.
[550.00 --> 554.00]  Who is the seed who crushed the serpent's head.
[554.00 --> 561.00]  The one who says, I am he who is and who was and who is to come.
[561.00 --> 563.00]  The Almighty.
[563.00 --> 568.00]  And it is in his name and through his name that we pray this morning.
[568.00 --> 569.00]  As his people.
[569.00 --> 572.00]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[572.00 --> 575.00]  Would you please rise for God's greeting to us.
[575.00 --> 579.00]  And this comes from Matthew chapter 4 verses 15 to 17.
[579.00 --> 585.00]  The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali.
[585.00 --> 587.00]  The way of the sea beyond the Jordan.
[587.00 --> 589.00]  Galilee of the Gentiles.
[589.00 --> 593.00]  The people living in darkness have seen a great light.
[593.00 --> 596.00]  On those living in the land of the shadow of death.
[596.00 --> 599.00]  A light has dawned.
[599.00 --> 602.00]  From that time on, Jesus began to preach.
[602.00 --> 607.00]  Repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
[607.00 --> 608.00]  Say with me together.
[608.00 --> 610.00]  The kingdom of heaven has come near.
[610.00 --> 613.00]  The kingdom of heaven has come near.
[613.00 --> 615.00]  Praise be to God.
[615.00 --> 617.00]  Would you turn and greet one another.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  You will.
[618.00 --> 619.00]  Until and out.
[619.00 --> 620.00]  Lord.
[620.00 --> 621.00]  You hear.
[621.00 --> 622.00]  Uh, big 하나.
[622.00 --> 623.00]  To be a �ирrankman to the новую screen.
[623.00 --> 624.18]  Yeah.
[625.00 --> 626.00]  My hero."
[626.00 --> 627.00]  A lot of things might not really seem to be.
[627.00 --> 628.00]  In the name of井.
[628.00 --> 629.00]  The 맞아.
[629.00 --> 632.00]  Over and to the next section, there will be working on a card.
[632.00 --> 661.98]  Thank you.
[662.00 --> 691.98]  Thank you.
[692.00 --> 697.00]  Let earth receive her hand.
[697.90 --> 704.00]  Let every heart prepare Him through.
[704.10 --> 709.00]  And heaven and nature sing.
[709.00 --> 715.00]  And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
[716.68 --> 721.00]  Joy to the earth the Savior reigns.
[721.00 --> 727.00]  Let all their songs employ.
[727.00 --> 733.00]  Of fields and floods, rocks, fields and plains.
[733.00 --> 736.00]  Repeat the sounding joy.
[736.00 --> 739.00]  Repeat the sounding joy.
[739.00 --> 745.00]  Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
[745.00 --> 753.00]  No more the same and sorrow grow.
[753.00 --> 757.00]  No thorns infest the ground.
[757.00 --> 764.00]  He comes to make His blessings come.
[764.00 --> 770.00]  For as the curse is found.
[770.00 --> 776.00]  For as, for as the curse is found.
[776.00 --> 784.00]  He rules the world with truth and grace.
[784.00 --> 790.00]  And makes the nations prove.
[790.00 --> 796.00]  For the glories of His righteousness.
[796.00 --> 800.00]  And wonders of His love.
[800.00 --> 802.00]  And wonders of His love.
[802.00 --> 804.00]  And wonders of His love.
[804.00 --> 808.00]  And wonders of His love.
[808.00 --> 810.00]  For as the curse is found.
[810.00 --> 814.00]  For as the curse is found.
[814.00 --> 816.00]  For as the curse is found.
[816.00 --> 829.00]  For as the curse is 나올 over,
[829.00 --> 831.00]  You have peace be found!
[831.00 --> 834.00]  You have peace be found!
[834.00 --> 835.94]  and I have a review.
[839.00 --> 842.84]  Year in Review 2022, Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[843.48 --> 847.34]  Once again, we as a congregation can testify to God's faithfulness.
[848.16 --> 852.76]  We were able to hear God's word preached to us each Sunday of this past year.
[853.38 --> 857.28]  We are thankful for the faithful preaching and shepherding of Pastor Jason.
[858.32 --> 862.10]  Pastor Jason and his family have been with us three years as of today.
[864.00 --> 867.44]  Some of the sermon series Pastor Jason preached this year were
[867.44 --> 870.86]  a series on the Lord's Prayer, Teach Us to Pray,
[871.70 --> 874.66]  a Lenten series, The Seven Last Words of Jesus,
[875.54 --> 877.56]  and Life Together from Ephesians,
[877.96 --> 881.08]  and the Advent series, Mothers of Jesus.
[881.86 --> 884.92]  We have been blessed by Pastor Jason's sermons.
[885.92 --> 889.78]  In the spring, Pastor Jason was able to take a two-week study leave
[889.78 --> 894.80]  to Egypt, Jordan, and Israel, along with other CRC pastors.
[896.06 --> 900.72]  We are thankful that the COVID restrictions were lifted this past year,
[901.20 --> 903.88]  and the following ministries were able to resume.
[904.08 --> 907.80]  The Kids Life Program, the Cadets, the Gems,
[908.66 --> 911.12]  Friendship Ministries, Men's Breakfast,
[912.12 --> 913.76]  Singing at the Mountain View Manor,
[913.76 --> 918.26]  Small Groups, Coffee Breaks on Wednesdays for Men and Women,
[919.18 --> 924.18]  and Young Men's Bible Study, including our young Pastor Jason.
[924.96 --> 929.54]  We were able to host two one-week basic skills camps this past summer.
[930.32 --> 935.10]  Thanks to all those involved who made these camps a success.
[936.24 --> 939.60]  ESL classes were started this fall with good participation.
[939.60 --> 945.02]  We appreciate each volunteer involved in all of these ministries.
[945.24 --> 947.20]  None of them would have happened without you.
[948.34 --> 951.74]  We were able to take part in two sessions of cross-training.
[952.64 --> 956.94]  The sessions were End of Life Issues and on the Psalms.
[957.88 --> 962.08]  Earlier this year, about 25 persons took part in listening circles.
[962.54 --> 965.42]  These groups were formed to listen to each other
[965.42 --> 967.88]  in relation to the Human Sexuality Report,
[968.46 --> 971.02]  which came before our Synod this past June.
[972.68 --> 980.32]  After serving as our Children's Ministry Director for two years,
[980.92 --> 982.26]  Hannah Yao left us.
[982.78 --> 985.10]  We are currently looking for someone to replace her.
[986.06 --> 988.46]  Meanwhile, her role is being filled with volunteers.
[989.74 --> 992.62]  Paul Kemp was hired as our part-time music director.
[992.62 --> 995.40]  Paul's gifts are certainly a blessing to our worship.
[996.48 --> 1000.74]  At first, after many years, we had a choir as part of our Christmas Eve service.
[1001.90 --> 1006.30]  Our associate pastor, Nancy, continues to be a blessing in our Chinese ministry.
[1006.76 --> 1010.56]  Her ministry consists of Sunday morning worship, prayer meetings,
[1011.02 --> 1015.12]  gospel classes which lead to baptism and professional faith,
[1015.64 --> 1018.04]  Bible study, and parenting classes.
[1018.04 --> 1024.04]  Once per month, our two worshiping groups meet on our family Sunday.
[1024.46 --> 1026.58]  We worship and celebrate communion together
[1026.58 --> 1029.28]  and then go our separate ways for the sermon.
[1030.60 --> 1032.96]  Pastor Nancy had a serious surgery this fall,
[1033.58 --> 1036.52]  and we are praying for her return to lead the Chinese ministry.
[1037.38 --> 1040.92]  In the background, many groups and committees function faithfully.
[1040.92 --> 1048.68]  Worship committee, hospitality, maintenance, counting, library, nursery, safe church,
[1049.38 --> 1051.50]  and our church council, the elders and deacons.
[1052.60 --> 1055.02]  A special thank you to Mel Rast, our treasurer,
[1055.26 --> 1058.70]  for keeping our finances and records in such good order.
[1059.14 --> 1061.70]  Also, thanks to our audio-visual team.
[1062.22 --> 1067.70]  Without them, we would not be able to continue the live streaming of our services.
[1067.70 --> 1074.04]  One of the highlights of this year was the many baptisms we were able to witness.
[1074.36 --> 1078.70]  Children baptized were Ezra Klumps and William Van Rine.
[1079.86 --> 1085.22]  Adults baptized were Winnie Zhao and Winnie Liu in January.
[1086.16 --> 1090.82]  And this past August, on a beautiful summer day at the Hamming Swimming Pool,
[1090.82 --> 1093.86]  the following persons were baptized.
[1095.00 --> 1103.84]  Ying Ye, Danny Liu, Song Liu, Xiao Su, Stephen Yeen, Peter Yu, and Mei Zhang.
[1105.16 --> 1107.52]  Two of our members were married this past year,
[1107.94 --> 1110.98]  Joel Smith to Felicia Ali,
[1111.54 --> 1114.00]  and Lorna Hamming to Kenny McRae.
[1114.00 --> 1119.88]  Owen Rusticus joined us as a member transferring from another church.
[1121.16 --> 1124.28]  Many new people are joining us in worship each Sunday
[1124.28 --> 1126.60]  and getting involved in our ministries.
[1127.20 --> 1129.88]  Pastor Jason has made membership classes available
[1129.88 --> 1132.18]  for those wishing to become members.
[1133.06 --> 1135.00]  We also celebrated the births of
[1135.00 --> 1138.08]  Avena Fashi Koshrafter,
[1138.08 --> 1140.88]  Stephen Canaris,
[1140.88 --> 1142.88]  Abriela Buran,
[1142.88 --> 1145.68]  and the adoption of Rhea Van Tull.
[1145.68 --> 1150.36]  Some of our long-term members have moved from our community,
[1150.36 --> 1154.28]  Ali Bixma and Hans Bonkis, to Elam in Surrey,
[1154.28 --> 1159.56]  and Jerry and Ann Kron to CARE, also in Surrey.
[1159.56 --> 1164.56]  Our congregation was saddened by the death of three long-time members,
[1164.56 --> 1165.80]  John Bauman,
[1165.80 --> 1167.20]  Corey DeBrine,
[1167.20 --> 1168.12]  and Hank Nyman.
[1168.12 --> 1170.44]  We take comfort from the psalmist,
[1170.44 --> 1172.60]  knowing that the Lord heals the brokenhearted
[1172.60 --> 1174.24]  and binds their wounds.
[1174.24 --> 1177.04]  We look forward to the return of Christ,
[1177.04 --> 1180.00]  when God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[1180.00 --> 1183.52]  There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
[1183.52 --> 1185.84]  There shall be no more pain,
[1185.84 --> 1187.96]  for the former things have passed away.
[1187.96 --> 1192.28]  We do not know what God has in store for us in 2023.
[1192.28 --> 1197.28]  We ask our Heavenly Father for his continued blessing and care
[1197.28 --> 1199.28]  as we grow in grace together.
[1199.28 --> 1200.72]  May we be faithful.
[1200.72 --> 1201.52]  Thank you.
[1201.52 --> 1208.52]  We might want to rise for this song.
[1208.52 --> 1215.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1215.52 --> 1217.52]  There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1217.52 --> 1221.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1221.52 --> 1223.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1223.52 --> 1228.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1228.52 --> 1235.52]  There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1235.52 --> 1238.52]  There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1238.52 --> 1244.52]  Thou changest not, like thou passions may fail not.
[1244.52 --> 1251.52]  As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.
[1251.52 --> 1252.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1252.52 --> 1261.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
[1261.52 --> 1262.96]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1262.96 --> 1265.86]  New mercies I see.
[1265.86 --> 1272.52]  All I have needed, Thy hast provided,
[1272.52 --> 1280.52]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1280.52 --> 1290.22]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest
[1290.22 --> 1297.10]  Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
[1297.10 --> 1303.96]  Joined with all nature in manifold witness
[1303.96 --> 1311.22]  To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love
[1311.22 --> 1317.96]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness
[1318.60 --> 1325.22]  Morning by morning new mercies I see
[1325.22 --> 1331.68]  All I have needed Thy hand has provided
[1331.68 --> 1339.68]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me
[1339.68 --> 1349.04]  Pardon for sin and the peace that angels have
[1349.04 --> 1355.92]  Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide
[1355.92 --> 1361.92]  Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
[1361.92 --> 1368.92]  Blessings alive with ten thousand beside
[1368.92 --> 1376.92]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness
[1376.92 --> 1383.92]  Morning by morning new mercies I see
[1383.92 --> 1390.92]  All I have needed Thy hand has provided
[1390.92 --> 1398.92]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me
[1398.92 --> 1408.92]  How great the castle that lay between us
[1408.92 --> 1415.92]  How high the mountain I could not climb
[1415.92 --> 1425.92]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[1425.92 --> 1429.92]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[1429.92 --> 1439.92]  I spoke Your name into the night
[1439.92 --> 1443.92]  And through the darkness Your loving kindness
[1443.92 --> 1449.92]  Tore through the shadows of my soul
[1449.92 --> 1451.92]  The work is finished The work is finished
[1451.92 --> 1457.92]  The end is written Jesus Christ
[1457.92 --> 1459.92]  My living hope
[1459.92 --> 1461.92]  The end is written Jesus Christ
[1461.92 --> 1469.92]  Who could imagine so great a mercy
[1469.92 --> 1475.92]  My heart could fathom such boundless grace
[1475.92 --> 1481.92]  That God of ages stepped down from glory
[1481.92 --> 1485.92]  And bear my sin and bear my shame
[1485.92 --> 1491.92]  The cross has spoken I am forgiven
[1491.92 --> 1497.92]  The King of kings calls me His own
[1497.92 --> 1503.92]  Beautiful Savior I am yours forever
[1503.92 --> 1509.92]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[1509.92 --> 1515.92]  Alleluia, praise the one who set me free
[1515.92 --> 1521.92]  Alleluia, death has lost its grip on me
[1521.92 --> 1524.92]  You have broken every chain
[1524.92 --> 1527.92]  There's salvation in Your name
[1527.92 --> 1534.92]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[1534.92 --> 1540.92]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[1540.92 --> 1546.92]  Your buried body began to breathe
[1546.92 --> 1552.92]  Out of the silence a boring lion
[1552.92 --> 1558.92]  He cleared the grave as no claim on me
[1558.92 --> 1564.92]  Jesus yours is the victory
[1564.92 --> 1566.92]  Alleluia, praise the one who set me free
[1566.92 --> 1568.92]  Alleluia, praise the one who set me free
[1568.92 --> 1570.92]  Alleluia, praise the one who set me free
[1570.92 --> 1576.24]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[1576.24 --> 1581.46]  declared that grave has no claim on me.
[1582.78 --> 1586.52]  Jesus, yours is the victory.
[1590.02 --> 1590.66]  Hallelujah.
[1591.32 --> 1593.96]  Praise the one who set me free.
[1595.90 --> 1596.42]  Hallelujah.
[1596.42 --> 1599.92]  Death has lost its grip on me.
[1599.92 --> 1602.60]  You have broken every chain.
[1602.90 --> 1605.38]  There's salvation in your name.
[1605.70 --> 1610.64]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1611.38 --> 1612.16]  Hallelujah.
[1614.10 --> 1616.74]  Praise the one who set me free.
[1617.10 --> 1617.88]  Hallelujah.
[1619.82 --> 1622.46]  Death has lost its grip on me.
[1622.46 --> 1625.24]  You have broken every chain.
[1625.58 --> 1628.06]  There's salvation in your name.
[1628.06 --> 1632.58]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1633.84 --> 1639.24]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1639.24 --> 1657.44]  So a new year is a time when we make new commitments.
[1658.16 --> 1658.32]  Right?
[1658.42 --> 1661.54]  We declare our future hopes.
[1661.54 --> 1669.42]  And as we look toward into this new year, we ask this question, where does my life need to change?
[1670.68 --> 1678.26]  Sometimes, you know, I think of all the ways it needs to change, but I don't want to make a commitment because then, well, sometimes I know I'm not actually going to fall through with it.
[1678.26 --> 1689.56]  But when it comes to our life with God, we have the equipping, we have the presence, we have the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1690.10 --> 1693.26]  The Holy Spirit can help us to change.
[1693.88 --> 1699.84]  It can help us transform us in our hearts and our inner being to become more like Christ.
[1699.84 --> 1705.14]  So we do need to ask, where is the Lord calling me to repentance?
[1706.10 --> 1712.82]  Where is he calling me to lay down habits of selfishness and pride?
[1712.82 --> 1716.40]  So let's pray this psalm together.
[1717.12 --> 1725.68]  And let's acknowledge our need for Jesus to do what we cannot do, which is to heal us, to forgive us, to restore us.
[1725.86 --> 1734.30]  In all those places where we have sinned and where we have been sinned against, where we have harmed and hurt and where we have broken.
[1735.14 --> 1739.98]  Let's read this psalm as a prayer together and let's read it responsibly.
[1740.98 --> 1742.10]  Psalm 139.
[1742.82 --> 1745.70]  You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.
[1746.62 --> 1749.50]  You know when I sit and when I rise.
[1750.04 --> 1752.66]  You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[1753.42 --> 1757.32]  You discern my going out and my lying down.
[1757.98 --> 1759.84]  You are familiar with all my ways.
[1760.82 --> 1765.78]  Before a word is on my tongue, you, Lord, know it completely.
[1766.68 --> 1772.64]  You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
[1772.82 --> 1776.34]  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[1776.34 --> 1779.22]  Too lofty for me to attain.
[1779.22 --> 1783.70]  And friends, let this be our prayer together as a community.
[1785.02 --> 1787.86]  Search me, God, and know my heart.
[1788.56 --> 1791.44]  Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[1792.10 --> 1794.96]  See if there is any offensive way in me.
[1794.96 --> 1798.36]  And lead me in the way of everlasting.
[1798.76 --> 1802.98]  And so we come before the Lord.
[1803.64 --> 1808.60]  We acknowledge that he knows us, which is such an amazing comfort.
[1808.60 --> 1812.36]  And it's a comfort because of Jesus.
[1812.36 --> 1819.30]  Because he has covered us with his forgiveness that he has accomplished on the cross on our behalf.
[1819.30 --> 1821.66]  And we receive his grace.
[1821.78 --> 1826.04]  We serve a God of limitless power and might.
[1827.82 --> 1831.38]  And yet, in his power, he looks on us with his mercy.
[1831.88 --> 1833.42]  He draws us into his family.
[1834.06 --> 1835.86]  Again, because of what Christ has done.
[1836.34 --> 1837.92]  So hear these words of grace.
[1838.44 --> 1839.80]  From Colossians chapter 3.
[1839.80 --> 1843.26]  Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[1844.02 --> 1846.90]  Set your hearts on things above where Christ is.
[1847.50 --> 1849.30]  Seated at the right hand of God.
[1850.18 --> 1853.52]  Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
[1854.82 --> 1857.06]  Hear and know that you are forgiven.
[1857.82 --> 1858.80]  And be at peace.
[1859.76 --> 1860.94]  Thanks be to God.
[1862.10 --> 1863.08]  Let's stand.
[1863.32 --> 1867.34]  Let's sing a song of rejoicing in God's grace to us.
[1867.34 --> 1868.70]  Let's stand and sing together.
[1868.70 --> 1868.78]  Let's sing together.
[1879.36 --> 1888.28]  By the days that God has numbered, I was made to walk with him.
[1888.66 --> 1896.80]  Yet I look for worldly treasure and forsake the king of kings.
[1896.80 --> 1900.80]  But mine is open, my redeemer.
[1901.80 --> 1904.80]  Though I fall, his love is sure.
[1905.94 --> 1910.22]  For Christ has paid for every failing.
[1910.62 --> 1914.90]  I am his forevermore.
[1916.94 --> 1921.18]  Mine are tears in times of sorrow.
[1921.70 --> 1924.80]  Darkness not yet understood.
[1924.80 --> 1929.80]  Through the valley I must travel.
[1929.80 --> 1933.80]  Where I see no earthly good.
[1933.80 --> 1938.96]  The finest peace that falls from heaven.
[1938.96 --> 1943.00]  And the strength in times of need.
[1943.00 --> 1946.80]  I know my pain will not be wasted.
[1946.80 --> 1951.80]  Christ completes his work in me.
[1951.80 --> 1957.80]  Mine are days here as a stranger.
[1957.80 --> 1961.80]  Pilgrim on a narrow way.
[1962.80 --> 1966.80]  One with Christ I will encounter.
[1966.80 --> 1970.80]  Harm and hatred for his pain.
[1970.80 --> 1975.80]  But mine is armor for this battle.
[1975.80 --> 1979.80]  Strong enough to last the war.
[1979.80 --> 1983.80]  And he has said he will deliver.
[1983.80 --> 1984.80]  Safe to the golden shore.
[1984.80 --> 1988.80]  Safe to the golden shore.
[1988.80 --> 1992.80]  And mine are keys to Zion City.
[1992.80 --> 1996.80]  Where beside the king I walk.
[1996.80 --> 2000.80]  For there my heart has found his treasure.
[2000.80 --> 2001.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2001.80 --> 2005.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2005.80 --> 2009.80]  And mine are keys to Zion City.
[2009.80 --> 2013.80]  Where beside the king I walk.
[2013.80 --> 2018.80]  For there my heart has found his treasure.
[2018.80 --> 2022.80]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[2022.80 --> 2023.80]  Ilene
[2023.80 --> 2027.80]  Amen
[2027.80 --> 2045.80]  At this time the children grade three through age three through grade five as it says there are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[2045.80 --> 2063.84]  classes.
[2063.84 --> 2070.88]  So today I am excited because we embark on a new sermon series for the season of Epiphany.
[2070.88 --> 2075.24]  Now if you are astute in these things you will know that it's actually still Christmas.
[2075.24 --> 2078.68]  There's 12 days of Christmas according to the song.
[2078.68 --> 2083.12]  This is day 8.
[2083.12 --> 2087.76]  Who knows in the song what is day 8?
[2087.76 --> 2088.76]  Lord's a leap?
[2088.76 --> 2089.76]  I don't know.
[2089.76 --> 2091.36]  It doesn't matter that's not in the Bible.
[2091.36 --> 2097.36]  But anyways it is still Christmas but because we are starting a new series on the Beatitudes
[2097.36 --> 2102.92]  the Beatitudes needs 8 weeks so we're going to borrow a week from Christmas and for the
[2102.92 --> 2103.92]  season of Epiphany.
[2103.92 --> 2104.92]  Now what's Epiphany?
[2104.92 --> 2110.52]  Epiphany is the season in the church year where we celebrate that Christ has come and
[2110.52 --> 2116.24]  his word is going forth as a light to all the world, the Gentiles and us.
[2116.24 --> 2121.84]  And it's a time when we consider the teachings of Jesus, his life, his ministry in this world.
[2121.84 --> 2126.14]  And so that's why we look in this season to the Beatitudes.
[2126.14 --> 2132.74]  One of Jesus' most beloved teachings about what it means to be his disciples.
[2132.74 --> 2135.46]  What does it mean to be a disciple of Jesus?
[2135.46 --> 2138.46]  What does it mean to be the blessed people of God?
[2138.46 --> 2142.06]  So that's what we're going to look at over the next couple weeks.
[2142.06 --> 2148.20]  So would you then turn in your Bibles if you have, you probably do have one in your vicinity
[2148.20 --> 2148.90]  in front of you.
[2148.90 --> 2153.60]  We will also have it on the screen, but I'd like for us to have it in front of us.
[2154.10 --> 2156.28]  So Matthew chapter 5.
[2156.28 --> 2169.00]  And we will actually read right now verses 1 through 10.
[2169.00 --> 2170.46]  We'll read the whole Beatitudes.
[2170.46 --> 2176.38]  Okay, so that is on page 719 in your pew Bible.
[2176.38 --> 2179.24]  So please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[2179.24 --> 2184.60]  Now, when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[2184.60 --> 2189.34]  His disciples came to him and he began to teach them saying,
[2189.34 --> 2193.76]  Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2194.56 --> 2198.02]  Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.
[2198.02 --> 2202.84]  Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth.
[2202.84 --> 2208.52]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled.
[2208.52 --> 2213.26]  Blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy.
[2213.26 --> 2217.50]  Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.
[2217.50 --> 2222.58]  Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God.
[2222.58 --> 2226.38]  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness
[2226.38 --> 2230.50]  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2230.50 --> 2232.60]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2232.60 --> 2234.36]  Thanks be to God.
[2234.36 --> 2235.76]  Let's pray together.
[2235.76 --> 2248.96]  Lord Jesus Christ, we are grateful this morning that you helped Matthew the tax collector remember these words that you spoke to your followers on the mountainside that day.
[2248.96 --> 2255.18]  Would you help us now today to understand your word?
[2255.18 --> 2261.10]  But more than understand it, would you help us to live into it and to be changed by it?
[2261.10 --> 2266.82]  For this we pray in your name and for your glory, the renown of your name in all the world.
[2266.92 --> 2268.02]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2268.52 --> 2268.82]  Amen.
[2268.82 --> 2279.28]  Now, when it comes to Jesus, lots of people are interested, but few are invested.
[2279.28 --> 2285.16]  So in the passage, actually just before the Beatitudes, just before the passage we read,
[2285.76 --> 2291.66]  we find that the crowds gathered around Jesus and we read at the end of chapter 4,
[2292.40 --> 2295.86]  beginning in verse 23, just a couple of verses ahead.
[2296.06 --> 2298.04]  Chapter 4, verse 23, this is what it says.
[2298.04 --> 2306.96]  Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom,
[2307.96 --> 2311.98]  and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
[2312.98 --> 2319.38]  News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases,
[2320.24 --> 2326.86]  those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures in the paralyzed.
[2326.86 --> 2328.68]  And he healed them.
[2329.28 --> 2338.16]  Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.
[2338.16 --> 2346.40]  Then, this cuts to our present scene here in chapter 5.
[2347.18 --> 2348.32]  But, I mean, think about this.
[2348.42 --> 2349.32]  Imagine this.
[2349.72 --> 2353.32]  Jesus healing throughout the entire area.
[2353.32 --> 2361.86]  And the crowds, whether they're hearing about all that Jesus is doing.
[2361.86 --> 2367.06]  And with every possible need that human beings can have, they are wondering,
[2367.06 --> 2371.78]  if I bring it to Jesus, will he heal it?
[2373.12 --> 2377.38]  So the crowds press around Jesus.
[2378.20 --> 2379.14]  And you know what?
[2380.28 --> 2381.96]  Jesus met those needs.
[2383.06 --> 2387.06]  For Jesus had compassion on the people.
[2387.06 --> 2391.34]  And it wasn't wrong for people to bring their needs to Jesus.
[2391.96 --> 2392.10]  Right?
[2392.14 --> 2396.62]  It's not wrong for people to be interested in Jesus because he healed them.
[2397.38 --> 2399.84]  People need healing and they need hope.
[2400.32 --> 2401.24]  And that is good.
[2401.90 --> 2407.80]  But what we see next is that it's not good enough simply to need healing.
[2407.80 --> 2411.20]  So verse 1 in our passage.
[2411.96 --> 2418.02]  Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[2418.72 --> 2422.16]  His disciples came to him and he began to teach them.
[2423.08 --> 2429.78]  The crowds are pressing in so much that Jesus is forced to go up on the mountainside to teach.
[2430.50 --> 2432.20]  So I want to share a photo with you.
[2432.20 --> 2442.16]  Here is the likely, this is a modern day photo of what is now called the Mount of the Beatitudes.
[2443.04 --> 2448.92]  And there is a Roman Catholic church there on my trip that John, our clerk, mentioned.
[2449.20 --> 2453.84]  I did get to go to that area and our tour guide kept saying, you know, we're not into Square Inch.
[2453.86 --> 2456.52]  We don't know exactly where Jesus gave the Beatitudes.
[2457.16 --> 2461.92]  But we went to the place where he thought it was more likely, which is not the traditional site.
[2462.50 --> 2464.74]  We were just driving along the highway and he's like, stop.
[2464.86 --> 2465.42]  So we get off.
[2465.50 --> 2466.16]  There's nothing around.
[2466.26 --> 2467.00]  We hike up this hill.
[2467.40 --> 2468.46]  He said, this is where it was.
[2469.32 --> 2473.42]  And actually, I got to read the Beatitudes to our group on that hill.
[2474.12 --> 2475.52]  I wish I had a video of that to show you.
[2475.76 --> 2482.10]  But anyway, there's a picture just to help you imagine the scene, the beauty of it.
[2482.14 --> 2483.06]  And that's the Sea of Galilee.
[2483.06 --> 2491.86]  But Jesus goes up the mountainside, not just for practical reasons, not just to get away from the crowd.
[2492.62 --> 2498.62]  Because mountains for the ancient Israelites were spiritually charged places.
[2499.42 --> 2502.90]  So this isn't just a passing comment that Jesus went up a mountainside.
[2503.14 --> 2504.90]  This is significant.
[2504.90 --> 2513.58]  Jesus goes up the mountain and this would immediately make all of his Israelite followers think of Mount Sinai.
[2514.38 --> 2516.84]  And they would immediately think of Moses.
[2517.98 --> 2518.20]  Right?
[2518.32 --> 2519.62]  Moses went up the mountain.
[2520.42 --> 2522.90]  And on this mountain, Moses met with God.
[2522.90 --> 2525.06]  He received the Ten Commandments.
[2525.42 --> 2533.62]  And he came back down with two tablets of stone, the very constitution, to form the people of God.
[2534.70 --> 2540.90]  And what Matthew wants us to see here in this gospel is that Jesus is the true and better Moses.
[2541.80 --> 2547.16]  Like Moses, Jesus went up on the mountain to form a new people of God.
[2547.16 --> 2553.16]  But Jesus goes up not to receive a revelation, but to give it.
[2554.36 --> 2557.38]  Jesus opens his mouth to teach.
[2558.04 --> 2560.14]  And he teaches as one with authority.
[2561.46 --> 2566.28]  And he doesn't give a law that would then simply be engraved on stone.
[2566.92 --> 2573.12]  No, Jesus offers teaching that is not written on tablets of stone, but are written on the human heart.
[2573.12 --> 2578.60]  And this is what the prophet Jeremiah writes about the Messiah who is to come.
[2579.50 --> 2580.42]  This is what it says.
[2580.88 --> 2582.22]  Jeremiah 31, 33.
[2583.02 --> 2587.52]  This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord.
[2587.94 --> 2592.50]  I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts.
[2593.08 --> 2594.66]  I will be their God.
[2595.38 --> 2597.14]  They will be my people.
[2598.22 --> 2598.36]  Right?
[2598.36 --> 2605.90]  So Jesus, in this very moment, like Moses with the people of Israel, he is convening a new people of God.
[2605.94 --> 2609.98]  And that's why it says there, I will be their God and they will be my people.
[2610.08 --> 2613.38]  And I will write my law on their hearts.
[2614.92 --> 2617.80]  But notice, it's not just everyone.
[2619.50 --> 2621.64]  Notice again in verse 1 what it says.
[2622.52 --> 2622.64]  Right?
[2622.64 --> 2625.70]  The crowds saw Jesus.
[2626.48 --> 2628.68]  Jesus saw the crowds.
[2629.68 --> 2631.50]  And then he went up on a mountainside.
[2632.08 --> 2632.98]  And who came to him?
[2634.22 --> 2634.86]  His disciples.
[2634.96 --> 2635.64]  Not the crowd.
[2636.10 --> 2637.94]  His disciples came to him.
[2638.32 --> 2641.84]  And he began to teach them.
[2643.64 --> 2647.44]  Those who weren't just merely interested in him,
[2648.08 --> 2651.06]  but those who were invested in him.
[2651.06 --> 2654.94]  His disciples came to him and he taught them.
[2656.18 --> 2657.76]  And unlike Moses,
[2658.66 --> 2664.10]  Jesus had the actual ability to transform our lives from the inside out.
[2664.58 --> 2664.78]  Right?
[2664.80 --> 2666.94]  Not just to hand us down these high ideals,
[2667.50 --> 2670.76]  but to actually dwell richly within us and in us.
[2671.42 --> 2674.78]  Writing his law on our hearts so that we can then actually live them out.
[2675.22 --> 2679.06]  So that we can become people of the Beatitudes.
[2679.06 --> 2684.00]  And so the first Beatitude we're going to look at today is in verse 3.
[2685.54 --> 2689.88]  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.
[2690.18 --> 2691.26]  Would you say that with me?
[2692.50 --> 2697.72]  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.
[2699.76 --> 2700.64]  Kingdom of heaven.
[2700.80 --> 2700.94]  Sorry.
[2701.00 --> 2701.82]  I just said kingdom of God.
[2702.18 --> 2703.18]  Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2703.18 --> 2706.96]  Now I want you to notice two things, first of all,
[2707.00 --> 2709.36]  that are true of this Beatitude and all of the Beatitudes.
[2710.24 --> 2714.18]  First, notice the position of the pronoun theirs.
[2714.84 --> 2720.08]  It stands at the beginning of that second clause there for emphasis.
[2720.08 --> 2725.02]  So it says, theirs is the kingdom of heaven, not the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
[2725.24 --> 2726.52]  Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2726.60 --> 2733.50]  And the implication of that is theirs and only theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2734.94 --> 2736.96]  And then second, notice the verb is.
[2738.02 --> 2739.04]  It's not future.
[2739.22 --> 2741.24]  It's not blessed are the poor in spirit,
[2741.46 --> 2745.70]  for one day theirs will be the kingdom of heaven.
[2746.54 --> 2747.32]  It's not what it says.
[2747.32 --> 2752.96]  It says, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2753.50 --> 2756.14]  Meaning, present, now, already.
[2758.50 --> 2759.14]  It's ours.
[2760.06 --> 2764.24]  So, as we look at this Beatitude, I just want to look at it in two ways this morning.
[2764.32 --> 2766.80]  I want to ask two questions of the Beatitude.
[2767.06 --> 2770.82]  First, first question, what does it mean to be poor in spirit?
[2771.84 --> 2773.28]  What does it mean to be poor in spirit?
[2773.28 --> 2776.84]  And then secondly, why are the poor in spirit blessed?
[2777.32 --> 2778.32]  Why are they blessed?
[2779.16 --> 2781.20]  So, let's look at our first question this morning.
[2781.30 --> 2782.62]  What does it mean to be poor in spirit?
[2782.72 --> 2783.52]  That's the first question.
[2784.18 --> 2787.82]  Now, in the New Testament, as I've heard from some commentators,
[2788.22 --> 2791.66]  there are two words that are often translated for the poor.
[2792.46 --> 2796.66]  One of these describes those who in the world just have very little.
[2796.66 --> 2802.14]  And they are those who have to work all day for their daily needs.
[2802.94 --> 2810.54]  But there's another word which describes people who are so destitute that they are forced to beg.
[2810.54 --> 2816.02]  So, the first word refers to those who at least have the very bare necessities.
[2816.68 --> 2824.08]  The second word refers to those who have absolutely nothing and they know it.
[2824.72 --> 2827.70]  Now, of course, guess which word Jesus uses here.
[2828.70 --> 2829.54]  It's the second.
[2829.54 --> 2834.68]  Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[2835.48 --> 2839.44]  Blessed are the destitute in spirit.
[2840.38 --> 2844.48]  Blessed are the beggars in spirit.
[2845.72 --> 2846.30]  Beggars.
[2846.40 --> 2850.18]  When you see a beggar, they have empty hands.
[2850.88 --> 2851.00]  Right?
[2851.04 --> 2853.00]  They have nothing in their pockets.
[2853.10 --> 2855.40]  They have nothing with which to buy help.
[2855.40 --> 2858.42]  They are completely desperate.
[2858.60 --> 2859.22]  They have nothing.
[2859.92 --> 2862.74]  They only have their profound need.
[2863.86 --> 2868.62]  And Jesus says, blessed are those who come to God with empty hands.
[2869.60 --> 2876.74]  Blessed are those who approach the living God as spiritual beggars with nothing.
[2877.58 --> 2878.64]  Empty pockets.
[2878.64 --> 2885.66]  The poor in spirit are those who know that they have nothing with which to buy the kingdom.
[2886.82 --> 2891.94]  Now, Luke's gospel talks a lot more so than the others about the rich and the poor.
[2893.22 --> 2898.64]  And in Luke's gospel, we see Jesus speaks a word of woe on the rich.
[2899.70 --> 2903.72]  But what's interesting is it's not because they're rich per se.
[2903.72 --> 2910.20]  It's not because they're wealthy, but because of the attitude that their wealth often produces,
[2910.44 --> 2912.86]  which is an attitude of not needing God.
[2913.28 --> 2917.52]  An attitude of kind of prideful self-sufficiency.
[2918.20 --> 2919.36]  They don't need God.
[2919.46 --> 2920.38]  They have their wealth.
[2921.70 --> 2923.60]  So Jesus says, woe to you.
[2923.74 --> 2927.96]  Not because they're wealthy, but because they're self-sufficient in their hearts.
[2927.96 --> 2937.02]  And at the same time, the Bible does not teach that poverty is equal to genuine spirituality.
[2937.84 --> 2938.30]  Right?
[2938.38 --> 2948.40]  Over and over again, the scriptures do show us that the conditions of the poor are more likely to help someone connect with God,
[2948.64 --> 2953.32]  to know their true spiritual need, more so than the conditions of the rich.
[2953.32 --> 2964.08]  This is true, but economic poverty, material poverty, does not guarantee true spiritual poverty.
[2965.82 --> 2970.48]  So you can be wealthy materially and yet poor in spirit.
[2970.84 --> 2974.40]  You can be poor materially, economically.
[2976.40 --> 2977.78]  Wait, I got confused.
[2978.40 --> 2980.58]  But I think you, I hope you get the idea.
[2980.58 --> 2982.80]  One does not equal the other.
[2983.86 --> 2989.64]  Now the poor do not inherit the kingdom of God because they are economically poor.
[2990.94 --> 2993.34]  That would be obviously a perversion of the gospel.
[2994.02 --> 2994.12]  Right?
[2994.18 --> 2996.20]  That would be salvation by social class.
[2996.90 --> 3004.34]  But rather, the word poor is meant to inform how we read and how we understand in spirit.
[3005.48 --> 3006.78]  It's poor in spirit.
[3006.78 --> 3013.48]  So there's this destitution, a bankruptcy, an emptiness in our inner being that Jesus calls blessed.
[3014.74 --> 3017.06]  And so then that brings us to our second question this morning.
[3018.04 --> 3019.84]  That's what the poor in spirit are.
[3020.46 --> 3021.88]  They're spiritual beggars.
[3021.98 --> 3022.44]  They're empty.
[3022.54 --> 3024.36]  They have nothing to come before God with.
[3024.80 --> 3026.02]  Now why is that blessed?
[3026.90 --> 3028.86]  Why are the poor in spirit blessed?
[3029.80 --> 3032.18]  Because if you think about it, isn't that kind of strange?
[3032.74 --> 3033.74]  The poor in spirit.
[3033.74 --> 3033.82]  Right?
[3034.82 --> 3036.10]  Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[3036.22 --> 3036.32]  Right?
[3036.36 --> 3037.60]  It's kind of like an oxymoron.
[3037.82 --> 3039.26]  You all know what an oxymoron is, right?
[3039.56 --> 3041.56]  Two contradictory terms.
[3042.24 --> 3044.20]  So, bittersweet.
[3045.06 --> 3046.04]  It's an oxymoron.
[3047.50 --> 3049.16]  Deafening silence.
[3050.32 --> 3050.88]  Oxymoron.
[3052.08 --> 3053.38]  Sweet sorrow.
[3053.92 --> 3054.20]  Shakespeare.
[3055.28 --> 3055.84]  Oxymoron.
[3056.80 --> 3058.26]  Blessed poor.
[3060.12 --> 3061.44]  It's an oxymoron, right?
[3061.44 --> 3065.66]  So, the Beatitudes, they begin by flipping our world upside down.
[3066.18 --> 3072.88]  They're calling people blessed who we would normally kind of look at and think of as unfortunate.
[3074.06 --> 3076.72]  So, why does Jesus call the poor in spirit blessed?
[3076.72 --> 3085.66]  In order to illustrate this, I was reminded of a trip that my family and I took to Tofino.
[3086.22 --> 3092.08]  And on our way there, we, you drive through, we stopped by Cathedral Grove.
[3092.70 --> 3094.40]  Who has been to Cathedral Grove?
[3095.26 --> 3096.26]  A lot of us, right?
[3097.74 --> 3099.04]  Beautiful place.
[3099.04 --> 3104.30]  You know, it's an old growth forest full of rare and endangered Douglas firs.
[3104.52 --> 3107.98]  Some of them are hundreds, 800 years old.
[3108.44 --> 3110.76]  Some of them are as tall as 250 feet.
[3111.02 --> 3112.88]  30 feet around in circumference.
[3113.00 --> 3115.18]  It's these massive, these beautiful trees.
[3115.86 --> 3117.80]  But there are also these red cedars.
[3118.76 --> 3120.70]  Some of these red cedars are solid.
[3121.64 --> 3124.48]  But others have become hollow.
[3124.48 --> 3131.62]  And what's interesting about cedars is that they are prone to decay from the inside out.
[3132.16 --> 3138.08]  And over time, these massive hollow trees, they are big enough that you can actually go inside them.
[3138.20 --> 3140.04]  That's one of the fun things to do at Cathedral Grove.
[3140.40 --> 3143.64]  So, here's a photo of my kids.
[3143.76 --> 3145.24]  They were, this was already several years ago.
[3145.34 --> 3146.20]  This is Ellie and Abram.
[3146.84 --> 3151.46]  And I kind of had to zoom in, but you can see, they're like, they're, hopefully you can see.
[3151.46 --> 3152.66]  Yeah, they're in there.
[3152.80 --> 3153.78]  They're in this big tree.
[3155.68 --> 3163.06]  And some of these trees, they become unhealthy because of this decay and eventually they collapse.
[3163.30 --> 3166.08]  But what's amazing is that some of them remain healthy.
[3166.84 --> 3171.46]  Some of them, they take deep enough root in the ground that they can absorb the nutrients.
[3172.08 --> 3173.86]  Some of them stretch forth their branches.
[3174.48 --> 3176.26]  They can receive the light.
[3176.26 --> 3182.58]  And the first beatitude, I think, makes us think of hollow trees.
[3183.30 --> 3183.44]  Right?
[3183.50 --> 3185.02]  There's this type of hollowness.
[3185.34 --> 3187.42]  There's a type of hollowness that leads to decay.
[3187.56 --> 3191.08]  And that's obviously not what Jesus would call blessed.
[3192.30 --> 3195.02]  But for the poor in spirit, there's a hollowness.
[3195.12 --> 3201.46]  There's an emptiness in ourselves that causes the poor in spirit to turn to God.
[3202.28 --> 3205.68]  The poor in spirit, they know their internal emptiness.
[3205.68 --> 3207.60]  They know their hollowness.
[3208.08 --> 3214.26]  And yet this makes space and room for the life of God to come inside.
[3215.12 --> 3216.76]  And that's what Jesus calls blessed.
[3218.00 --> 3219.56]  And so why are they blessed?
[3220.10 --> 3223.96]  They're blessed because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[3224.96 --> 3225.28]  Right?
[3225.36 --> 3230.74]  The hollowness that they have in themselves creates space for the kingdom of heaven to come in.
[3230.74 --> 3232.58]  That's why you're blessed.
[3232.58 --> 3241.60]  Because the spiritual poverty that you have, that you acknowledge, makes you open up your hands to receive the gift of the kingdom.
[3242.64 --> 3246.32]  So then, well, what is the kingdom of heaven?
[3246.32 --> 3253.34]  It refers not so much to a place as to the king himself.
[3254.68 --> 3261.66]  Jesus says the kingdom of God is at hand because I'm at hand.
[3261.66 --> 3266.16]  So look with me at chapter 4, verse 17.
[3266.38 --> 3268.76]  Again, just a couple of verses before our passage.
[3269.52 --> 3272.60]  Jesus, well, we read it earlier in our call to worship or our greeting.
[3273.18 --> 3275.44]  From that time on, Jesus began to preach.
[3276.06 --> 3280.22]  Repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
[3280.22 --> 3289.56]  What he's saying is that in him, in Jesus, the long-awaited kingdom of God is finally breaking into the world.
[3290.50 --> 3294.44]  The future reign of God is coming close into the present.
[3295.54 --> 3301.48]  And this is what we are told, foretold by Isaiah the prophet, that would be fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
[3301.58 --> 3304.14]  And so look at verse 16, the one right before.
[3304.14 --> 3308.64]  The people living in darkness have seen a great light.
[3308.88 --> 3314.78]  On those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
[3315.36 --> 3317.38]  There is a new dawn.
[3317.48 --> 3320.76]  The sun is risen and it is Jesus Christ himself.
[3320.88 --> 3321.52]  He has come.
[3321.84 --> 3323.26]  The kingdom of God is near.
[3323.64 --> 3325.80]  I am here.
[3327.18 --> 3329.82]  God's reign, his rule is in Jesus.
[3329.82 --> 3332.64]  And because of Jesus, come.
[3334.14 --> 3335.10]  Joy to the world.
[3335.18 --> 3336.94]  The Lord is come.
[3337.22 --> 3338.92]  He's here into the world.
[3339.84 --> 3347.04]  And so Jesus says, everything now you see me do is an expression of what it looks like when you are in the kingdom.
[3347.66 --> 3350.18]  When you're living under my reign and rule.
[3350.84 --> 3356.44]  And this is a beautiful thing because the kingdom of heaven has come into the hollow center.
[3356.62 --> 3362.50]  Into the poor in spirit who say, I have nothing but you, Lord.
[3362.70 --> 3364.00]  I have nothing but you.
[3364.14 --> 3367.72]  And Jesus then becomes everything.
[3368.28 --> 3369.34]  He becomes your everything.
[3370.32 --> 3371.64]  That's why you're blessed.
[3372.72 --> 3375.14]  Not because you are just spiritually poor.
[3375.98 --> 3381.66]  But because that spiritual poverty makes you open your hands to receive the gift of the kingdom.
[3381.66 --> 3385.46]  Which is to receive the king of the kingdom.
[3385.56 --> 3386.50]  To receive Jesus.
[3387.08 --> 3387.20]  Right?
[3387.24 --> 3390.68]  Because as a matter of fact, everybody is spiritually poor.
[3391.32 --> 3392.40]  That's what the Bible teaches.
[3392.40 --> 3395.08]  We are all spiritually bankrupt.
[3395.72 --> 3400.20]  Actually, all of us have nothing in our hands to bring before the king.
[3400.98 --> 3404.12]  Apart from Jesus, we have nothing to bring before the living God.
[3404.12 --> 3407.56]  But the thing is, not everyone acknowledges this.
[3408.70 --> 3411.46]  And that's why Jesus says, repent.
[3412.92 --> 3415.80]  Repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
[3416.12 --> 3417.84]  Don't be put off by that word repent.
[3418.76 --> 3421.16]  Repent just means turn around.
[3421.16 --> 3425.10]  Jesus is saying, you're walking in this darkness.
[3425.28 --> 3426.66]  You're going in the wrong direction.
[3427.64 --> 3431.72]  You're spiritually poor, but you kind of have this prideful self-sufficiency.
[3431.92 --> 3433.90]  You're not acknowledging your need.
[3434.26 --> 3434.94]  Turn around.
[3435.62 --> 3436.68]  Head in a new direction.
[3436.88 --> 3438.84]  Embrace me in the gospel.
[3438.84 --> 3446.44]  And the poor in spirit are those who recognize and admit their spiritual poverty.
[3447.08 --> 3451.62]  They are the ones who make that U-turn and turn toward Jesus.
[3451.76 --> 3457.12]  They have laid aside everything that the world would look to as something that they could bring before God
[3457.12 --> 3461.76]  to merit God's blessing upon them.
[3461.96 --> 3464.70]  They have admitted their fundamental helplessness.
[3465.20 --> 3466.76]  And it drives them to Jesus.
[3466.76 --> 3472.98]  And then they hear Jesus say, congratulations, you blessed bum.
[3475.50 --> 3477.60]  You get the kingdom.
[3479.24 --> 3479.92]  Congratulations.
[3480.52 --> 3481.54]  Blessed are you.
[3482.46 --> 3483.28]  You have nothing.
[3483.94 --> 3485.16]  You have turned to me.
[3485.98 --> 3487.02]  You have everything.
[3487.24 --> 3488.16]  You have the kingdom.
[3490.32 --> 3491.78]  I'll close with this.
[3492.72 --> 3495.20]  Brendan Manning was a priest.
[3495.20 --> 3497.76]  I don't know if he still is, but he's an author.
[3498.70 --> 3504.10]  And he suggests that the poor in spirit are like the survivors of a shipwreck.
[3505.38 --> 3505.56]  Okay?
[3505.68 --> 3509.16]  He suggests that the poor in spirit are like survivors of a shipwreck.
[3509.16 --> 3510.86]  So this is what he writes.
[3512.44 --> 3517.56]  The shipwrecked have little in common with the landlocked.
[3517.86 --> 3518.06]  Okay?
[3518.06 --> 3519.24]  Shipwrecked, landlocked.
[3519.50 --> 3527.00]  The landlocked have their own security system, a home base, credentials and credit cards,
[3527.72 --> 3532.74]  storehouses and barns, their self-interest and investments intact.
[3532.74 --> 3540.20]  They never find themselves because they never really feel themselves lost.
[3541.54 --> 3547.34]  The shipwrecked, on the contrary, are the poor in spirit who reach out for that passing plank
[3547.34 --> 3550.28]  with the desperation of the drowning.
[3550.28 --> 3556.54]  Adrift on an angry sea, in a state of utter helplessness and vulnerability,
[3557.36 --> 3563.38]  the shipwrecked never asked what they could do to merit the plank and inherit the kingdom of dry land.
[3564.08 --> 3568.12]  They knew that there was absolutely nothing any of them could do.
[3568.12 --> 3573.50]  Like little children, they simply receive the plank as a gift.
[3574.68 --> 3578.34]  And little children are precisely those who haven't done anything.
[3579.62 --> 3584.52]  Unless you become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven, Jesus says.
[3585.86 --> 3589.94]  Jesus is not suggesting that heaven is a vast playground for infants.
[3591.16 --> 3596.72]  Children are our model because they have no claim of heaven.
[3596.72 --> 3600.84]  If they are close to God, Simon Tugwell says,
[3601.34 --> 3607.48]  it is not because they are innocent, but because they are incompetent.
[3608.24 --> 3611.00]  Isn't that great? Incompetent.
[3611.98 --> 3615.42]  Blessed are the incompetent in spirit,
[3616.08 --> 3620.14]  for theirs and only theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[3621.58 --> 3622.60]  Manning continues,
[3622.60 --> 3624.60]  Friends,
[3624.60 --> 3648.28]  that's how we come.
[3648.28 --> 3649.46]  That's how we come to Jesus.
[3649.64 --> 3653.00]  We come empty-handed before God,
[3653.58 --> 3655.80]  and he is able to fill us up.
[3656.12 --> 3657.70]  He is able to take this hollowness,
[3658.16 --> 3660.46]  fill it with his kingdom life,
[3660.90 --> 3663.82]  so that we would be that tree deeply rooted,
[3664.74 --> 3666.60]  alive, flourishing,
[3667.42 --> 3668.08]  poor in spirit.
[3668.90 --> 3669.52]  Let's pray.
[3669.52 --> 3669.58]  Amen.
[3673.90 --> 3675.82]  Jesus, we come before you.
[3675.82 --> 3676.86]  You are the king.
[3678.38 --> 3681.76]  And there is nothing else in this world
[3681.76 --> 3685.32]  that we could bring before you to say,
[3685.76 --> 3687.66]  look at me,
[3687.82 --> 3688.64]  look at what I have,
[3688.74 --> 3689.52]  look at what I bring.
[3690.32 --> 3690.70]  But Lord,
[3690.78 --> 3692.00]  we only bring our emptiness.
[3693.68 --> 3694.30]  And we are,
[3694.40 --> 3694.80]  when we,
[3694.96 --> 3695.62]  by your help,
[3695.74 --> 3696.54]  by your Holy Spirit,
[3696.88 --> 3699.56]  are able to admit our neediness,
[3699.56 --> 3703.60]  that is when we hear your gracious words,
[3704.62 --> 3705.02]  blessed,
[3705.92 --> 3706.82]  your approval,
[3708.62 --> 3709.12]  yes,
[3710.04 --> 3710.62]  right,
[3711.62 --> 3713.74]  and you welcome us into your kingdom.
[3715.02 --> 3715.48]  Father,
[3715.56 --> 3718.90]  would you continue to create that humility,
[3719.06 --> 3720.92]  the humility of our Lord and Savior,
[3721.06 --> 3721.64]  Jesus Christ,
[3721.76 --> 3723.24]  would you create that in our hearts,
[3723.88 --> 3726.62]  that we may always come before you empty-handed
[3726.62 --> 3728.98]  to receive you and you alone.
[3729.22 --> 3729.72]  Fill us,
[3729.98 --> 3730.08]  Lord,
[3730.12 --> 3730.68]  with yourself.
[3731.44 --> 3732.70]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3733.00 --> 3733.30]  Amen.
[3734.90 --> 3736.44]  So for our song of response,
[3736.52 --> 3740.28]  I chose the well-known old hymn,
[3740.40 --> 3741.02]  Rock of Ages,
[3741.62 --> 3743.56]  because especially of this verse
[3743.56 --> 3744.64]  I want to share with you here,
[3745.02 --> 3745.64]  Rock of Ages.
[3745.64 --> 3747.88]  Nothing in my hand I bring,
[3748.86 --> 3751.36]  simply to thy cross I cling.
[3752.22 --> 3752.68]  Naked,
[3753.36 --> 3755.08]  come to thee for dress.
[3755.94 --> 3756.54]  Helpless,
[3757.04 --> 3758.98]  look to thee for grace.
[3759.80 --> 3760.30]  Foul,
[3760.60 --> 3761.16]  I too,
[3761.36 --> 3762.34]  the fountain fly.
[3762.92 --> 3763.42]  Wash me,
[3763.54 --> 3763.84]  Savior,
[3764.66 --> 3765.36]  or I die.
[3765.84 --> 3766.22]  My friends,
[3766.30 --> 3767.30]  this is the language
[3767.30 --> 3768.82]  of the poor in spirit.
[3769.64 --> 3770.46]  So let's rise
[3770.46 --> 3771.78]  and let's sing it together.
[3771.78 --> 3771.94]  Amen.
[3781.36 --> 3791.80]  Rock of Ages,
[3792.44 --> 3794.08]  clam for me,
[3794.46 --> 3799.00]  let me hide myself in thee.
[3799.00 --> 3803.00]  Let the water and the blood
[3803.00 --> 3807.64]  from thy wounded side which flow
[3807.64 --> 3812.84]  Be of sin the double cure.
[3813.44 --> 3817.30]  Save from wrath and make me pure.
[3818.94 --> 3823.34]  Not the labors of my hands
[3823.34 --> 3827.88]  Can fulfill thy lost demands.
[3827.88 --> 3832.10]  Could my zeal no respite know?
[3832.80 --> 3836.38]  Could my tears forever flow?
[3836.38 --> 3841.70]  All for sin could not atone.
[3842.34 --> 3846.44]  Thou must save and thou alone.
[3847.98 --> 3852.40]  Nothing in my hand I bring,
[3852.40 --> 3857.28]  Simply to thy cross I cling.
[3857.78 --> 3862.12]  May good come to thee for dress,
[3862.12 --> 3867.04]  Helpless look to thee for grace.
[3867.04 --> 3869.08]  Thou I too,
[3869.08 --> 3871.88]  the fountain fly.
[3872.12 --> 3873.22]  Wash me,
[3873.34 --> 3874.58]  Savior,
[3874.58 --> 3877.28]  or I die.
[3878.52 --> 3883.14]  While I draw this fleeting breath,
[3883.62 --> 3888.00]  When my eyes shall close in death,
[3888.00 --> 3892.16]  When I soar to worlds unknown,
[3892.16 --> 3897.56]  See thee on thy judgment throne,
[3898.10 --> 3900.04]  Rock of Ages,
[3900.04 --> 3902.36]  Clap for me,
[3902.36 --> 3907.74]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[3907.74 --> 3908.52]  Ooh,
[3908.52 --> 3910.58]  let me save me,
[3910.58 --> 3911.06]  Lord,
[3911.18 --> 3911.48]  let me live.
[3911.48 --> 3913.20]  Do you?
[3913.20 --> 3913.46]  Come on,
[3913.46 --> 3915.80]  THERE ARE Fní�es!
[3915.80 --> 3929.84]  ALL FOR ALL COME TOY lead me!
[3929.84 --> 3937.62]  And just a quick verse of scripture to remind us about giving, 2 Corinthians 9, 6-7.
[3938.28 --> 3943.94]  Paul the Apostle says, remember this, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly.
[3944.66 --> 3947.16]  Whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
[3948.20 --> 3955.84]  Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[3955.84 --> 3961.08]  So our designated offering for today is for our local church ministry.
[3961.24 --> 3969.84]  So several times throughout the year, the deacons have designated a couple Sundays to give toward specifically the ministries of our own congregation.
[3971.18 --> 3973.94]  And so may I ask the deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[3985.84 --> 3999.66]  Thank you so much.
[3999.66 --> 4000.66]  Amen.
[4029.66 --> 4031.66]  Amen.
[4059.66 --> 4060.66]  Amen.
[4060.66 --> 4061.66]  Amen.
[4061.66 --> 4062.66]  Amen.
[4062.66 --> 4063.66]  Amen.
[4063.66 --> 4064.66]  Amen.
[4064.66 --> 4065.66]  Amen.
[4065.66 --> 4066.66]  Amen.
[4066.66 --> 4067.66]  Amen.
[4067.66 --> 4068.66]  Amen.
[4068.66 --> 4069.66]  Amen.
[4069.66 --> 4070.66]  Amen.
[4070.66 --> 4071.66]  Amen.
[4071.66 --> 4076.66]  And I can't think of a better way of ushering in this new year than calling upon the Lord,
[4076.66 --> 4079.66]  the one who is faithful to his promises.
[4079.66 --> 4087.66]  So would you join me in heart and in mind as I lead us in this community prayer.
[4087.66 --> 4088.66]  Let's pray together.
[4088.66 --> 4099.66]  Faithful Father, even though we walk, as we always do, into an uncertain future, even
[4099.66 --> 4108.66]  if the winds of change continue unabated, you are our anchor in whatever stormy seasons may
[4108.66 --> 4116.66]  come our way, whether pandemic or disease or financial or sickness.
[4116.66 --> 4121.66]  You are the solid and the unmovable rock upon which we build our lives.
[4121.66 --> 4124.66]  And so why would we fear?
[4124.66 --> 4127.66]  Why would we be anxious?
[4127.66 --> 4128.66]  We are yours.
[4128.66 --> 4133.66]  We belong to you and you belong to us.
[4133.66 --> 4141.66]  It is in you alone that we are humbly confident and in whom we have deep assurance.
[4141.66 --> 4146.66]  And yet we know our hearts are prone to wander.
[4146.66 --> 4149.66]  We know our resolve never lasts.
[4150.66 --> 4152.66]  We know our faith is often fickle.
[4152.66 --> 4157.66]  We know our love for you and others often wanes.
[4157.66 --> 4162.66]  But Lord, your steadfast love, it never ceases.
[4162.66 --> 4169.66]  So our Father in heaven, we thank you that you have given so much to us.
[4169.66 --> 4172.66]  All that we have, every good thing that we have, Lord, is from you.
[4172.66 --> 4179.66]  And we do pray that your light, the light that you shared on Christmas and the coming of Jesus
[4179.66 --> 4184.66]  Christ would continue to permeate this world.
[4184.66 --> 4192.66]  Father, as we pray for our needs, we ask, oh Lord, that you would continue to guide us as a church in the coming year.
[4192.66 --> 4195.66]  Would you give us your people wisdom?
[4195.66 --> 4204.66]  We pray that you would prepare and supply all of our needs to follow you in your mission as a community this year.
[4204.66 --> 4212.66]  Lord, supply our needs and give us wisdom as a denomination to follow you this year as well.
[4213.66 --> 4216.66]  Specifically, Lord, we pray for the needs of our church.
[4216.66 --> 4219.66]  We thank you for Jerry's birthday.
[4219.66 --> 4221.66]  It's 97.
[4221.66 --> 4225.66]  But Lord, be with him in his failing health and be with Anne as well.
[4225.66 --> 4234.66]  Lord, we especially pray this morning for Pastor Nancy, not only, Lord, that you would continue to help her to recover from her surgery.
[4234.66 --> 4237.66]  Lord, every day give her new strength.
[4237.66 --> 4241.66]  Lord, healing not only in her body, but in her heart.
[4241.66 --> 4248.66]  But Lord, also especially, Nancy's mom in China has just passed away.
[4248.66 --> 4258.66]  And so, Lord, we grieve with her on top of everything else, Lord, to lose her mom and not be able to go back.
[4258.66 --> 4267.66]  Lord, would you comfort Nancy today, especially, Lord, with your presence, your powerful presence, your gracious presence.
[4267.66 --> 4270.66]  Lord, would you comfort her and give her hope.
[4270.66 --> 4274.66]  Father, we pray for others in our church as well.
[4274.66 --> 4277.66]  We continue to lift up to you Pat.
[4277.66 --> 4280.66]  We thank you for a successful surgery.
[4280.66 --> 4284.66]  She gives thanks to the congregation for our prayers, our cards.
[4284.66 --> 4287.66]  And Lord, would you just continue to heal her.
[4287.66 --> 4292.66]  And Lord, we thank you for her faith, which shines through the various struggles that she has gone through.
[4292.66 --> 4300.66]  Lord, continue to be with Jordan and his family as he continues to seek to be healed from the cancer.
[4300.66 --> 4303.66]  Lord, would you accomplish that?
[4303.66 --> 4307.66]  Would you make him perfectly healthy, Lord, from the cancer?
[4307.66 --> 4310.66]  Lord, we continue to pray for grace as well.
[4310.66 --> 4312.66]  Lord, be with her.
[4312.66 --> 4314.66]  Do your work in her.
[4314.66 --> 4315.66]  Bring her to health.
[4315.66 --> 4324.66]  Father, and also Lord, we pray for Aline as she has some pain that the doctors aren't sure what it is.
[4324.66 --> 4329.66]  Lord, would you grant her comfort and Lord, would you help her get a clear diagnosis.
[4329.66 --> 4332.66]  And Father, we thank you for this new year.
[4332.66 --> 4336.66]  We thank you for this time, this year.
[4336.66 --> 4341.66]  Thank you that you work in the midst of time, that you are with us even today.
[4341.66 --> 4344.66]  Lord, we ask that you would consecrate this year.
[4344.66 --> 4348.66]  Father, would you remind us that our lives are not about us.
[4348.66 --> 4355.66]  Lord, would you take the attitude of John the Baptist and give it to us, the attitude that says,
[4355.66 --> 4357.66]  he must increase and I must decrease.
[4357.66 --> 4366.66]  And Father, we lift up all these prayers to you in the name of Jesus, our High Priest, our King,
[4366.66 --> 4374.66]  the light in our darkness, who taught us to pray, saying with him together in prayer,
[4374.66 --> 4378.66]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4378.66 --> 4380.66]  Thy kingdom come.
[4380.66 --> 4383.66]  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4383.66 --> 4391.66]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4391.66 --> 4396.66]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4396.66 --> 4401.66]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[4401.66 --> 4402.66]  Amen.
[4403.66 --> 4406.66]  Brothers and sisters, please rise.
[4407.66 --> 4411.66]  And God has the last word in our time of worship together.
[4411.66 --> 4415.66]  So I invite you to hold out your hands, receive God's blessing upon you.
[4415.66 --> 4421.66]  To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence,
[4421.66 --> 4423.66]  without fault and with great joy.
[4423.66 --> 4430.66]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[4430.66 --> 4434.66]  before all ages, now and forevermore.
[4434.66 --> 4435.66]  Amen.
[4435.66 --> 4439.66]  Let's remain standing and we'll sing our final song together.
[4439.66 --> 4441.66]  Let's sing.
[4441.66 --> 4443.66]  Let's sing.
[4443.66 --> 4468.14]  Joyful all ye nations rise, Jesus the light of the world.
[4468.14 --> 4480.70]  Joy in the triumph of the skies, Jesus the light of the world.
[4480.94 --> 4488.00]  We will walk in the light, beautiful light.
[4488.00 --> 4494.34]  Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[4494.34 --> 4507.48]  O shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus the light of the world.
[4508.34 --> 4521.90]  Rise by highest heaven adored, Jesus the light of the world.
[4521.90 --> 4534.38]  There is everlasting light, Jesus the light of the world.
[4534.38 --> 4542.04]  We will walk in the light, beautiful light.
[4542.94 --> 4548.42]  Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[4548.42 --> 4561.58]  Oh shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus the light of the world.
[4561.58 --> 4575.62]  Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace, Jesus the light of the world.
[4575.62 --> 4587.98]  Hail the sun of righteousness, Jesus the light of the world.
[4587.98 --> 4594.98]  We will walk in the light, beautiful light.
[4594.98 --> 4602.02]  Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[4602.02 --> 4614.98]  Home shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus the light of the world.
[4614.98 --> 4619.98]  Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
[4619.98 --> 4623.90]  J interfere with this, Jesus the light of the world.
[4623.90 --> 4638.44]  He goes spinning, Jesus the light of the earth.
[4638.44 --> 4639.44]  Amen.
[4668.44 --> 4669.44]  Amen.
