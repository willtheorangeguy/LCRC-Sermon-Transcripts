[266.04 --> 270.02]  And welcome, everyone, to our service today.
[270.90 --> 275.90]  A special welcome to Pastor Len Baderink, over there, yeah,
[276.10 --> 279.20]  and who has agreed to be a part of our service this morning.
[279.92 --> 284.72]  My name is Jake Cron, and I'll be leading us through the liturgical elements of our service this morning
[284.72 --> 287.90]  before Pastor Len leads us in exploring God's Word.
[288.70 --> 291.80]  Just a few announcements before we get going,
[291.90 --> 294.74]  and they're really just call-outs of what's already in your bulletin,
[294.74 --> 296.30]  but if you haven't had a chance to read it,
[296.82 --> 300.68]  there is a hymn sing planned for this evening, 7 p.m.
[301.90 --> 305.42]  And then next Sunday, don't forget to bring your appetites to church,
[305.58 --> 310.72]  because we do have the soup and bun lunch after the service on the 12th.
[311.12 --> 312.16]  That is next Sunday, right?
[312.64 --> 312.88]  Yes.
[313.38 --> 313.52]  Yeah.
[313.74 --> 314.00]  Okay.
[314.00 --> 316.38]  And then the 22nd.
[316.68 --> 320.08]  A little ways out there, but just a little over two weeks, there is a congregational meeting,
[320.22 --> 322.86]  so just plug for that ahead of time.
[323.34 --> 330.68]  And lastly, in the bulletin, you'll find this beautiful, colorful race relations insert,
[330.68 --> 334.96]  and it's something to spend some time reading and reflecting on
[334.96 --> 340.54]  and thinking how can we be more welcoming, inclusive, and even celebratory
[340.54 --> 343.50]  of all those within our diverse communities.
[346.64 --> 351.12]  Our call to worship this morning is based on Isaiah 40, verse 3.
[351.12 --> 352.62]  A voice cries,
[353.30 --> 355.32]  In the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.
[355.98 --> 358.56]  Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[359.54 --> 364.40]  As we worship today, let's prepare to welcome God's dramatic work in our midst,
[365.00 --> 368.62]  in our hearts, in our community, and in all of creation.
[369.64 --> 370.76]  Please join me in prayer.
[370.76 --> 378.24]  All-glorious God, we give you thanks.
[379.34 --> 384.36]  In your Son, Jesus Christ, you have given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.
[384.96 --> 391.64]  You chose us before the world was made to be your holy people without fault in your sight.
[392.30 --> 394.98]  You adopted us as your children in Christ.
[395.62 --> 398.00]  You have set us free by his blood.
[398.62 --> 400.24]  You have forgiven our sins.
[400.76 --> 403.26]  You have made known to us your secret purpose,
[403.60 --> 406.70]  to bring heaven and earth into unity in Christ.
[407.66 --> 412.02]  You have given us, your Holy Spirit, the seal and pledge of our inheritance.
[413.16 --> 416.40]  All praise and glory be yours, O God,
[416.50 --> 418.80]  for the richness of your grace,
[419.30 --> 421.10]  for the splendor of your gifts,
[421.64 --> 423.28]  for the wonder of your love.
[424.02 --> 424.30]  Amen.
[426.30 --> 428.72]  Now is a good time to stand, if you are able,
[429.40 --> 430.64]  and greet those around you.
[431.12 --> 432.42]  He is a good time to stand, if you are able,
[432.42 --> 433.40]  and my father works after he runs,
[433.40 --> 435.44]  great склад inconsistent with him.
[447.70 --> 447.94]  Amen.
[448.56 --> 450.12]  Now this will be the same question.
[450.52 --> 451.66]  If our property is this,
[451.66 --> 452.94]  is this mighty holy moment,
[453.02 --> 453.08]  important,
[453.14 --> 453.72]  not only for theードs,
[453.76 --> 454.28]  the throne of governor,
[454.36 --> 454.74]  a pent elementalொ,
[454.78 --> 455.42]  a castMC ever,

[626.32 --> 628.32]  Thank you.
[628.32 --> 630.32]  Thank you.
[630.32 --> 632.32]  Thank you.
[636.32 --> 638.32]  Thank you.
[638.32 --> 645.32]  So this time we are very blessed to have Faw with us this morning and she's going to share
[645.32 --> 650.32]  testimony and I believe her daughter Violet will help with the translation so Faw and Violet,
[650.32 --> 651.32]  please come on up.
[651.32 --> 653.32]  Please come on up.
[653.32 --> 655.32]  Thank you.
[655.32 --> 657.32]  Thank you.
[657.32 --> 659.32]  Thank you.
[659.32 --> 663.32]  Thank you.
[663.32 --> 665.32]  Thank you.
[665.32 --> 667.32]  Thank you.
[667.32 --> 684.26]  I just want to say hello to all my brother and sister in Christ.
[684.26 --> 712.04]  I am so thankful for God that, sorry, I am so glad that God gave me this opportunity to be here in a big and lovely church family once again.
[714.26 --> 734.30]  I am so thankful that all of you, brother and sister, didn't leave me alone during my sickness and prayed for me.
[734.30 --> 749.84]  I want to share my testimony today with you because of God's work and amazing God.
[749.84 --> 777.84]  That how God healed me and how I could feel his presence in my life by side me all that time.
[777.84 --> 782.84]  I am so thankful that I am with you.
[782.84 --> 786.84]  I am so thankful that I am with you.
[786.84 --> 792.84]  Is that the sharing just for the Bible verses Isaiah 41, 10?
[792.84 --> 796.84]  So don't fear for I am with you.
[796.84 --> 801.84]  Don't be dismayed for I am your God.
[801.84 --> 808.84]  Just my mom, is that too long?
[808.84 --> 817.84]  My mom write her testimony and I try to translate it and I will read for you.
[817.84 --> 823.84]  Sorry about bothering you because of my English but I try to do my best.
[823.84 --> 830.84]  Is that my mom's testimony.
[830.84 --> 832.84]  Oh sorry, I just bring my glasses.
[832.84 --> 833.84]  I am getting old.
[833.84 --> 834.84]  Sorry.
[834.84 --> 861.84]  I passed very difficult days during my illness.
[861.84 --> 868.84]  Sometimes I was very disappointed and sometimes I was hopeful.
[868.84 --> 872.84]  Time spent really hard and long for me.
[872.84 --> 884.84]  When I was in hospital for more than a month, I didn't feel well but I had hope in God during all that time.
[884.84 --> 899.84]  Until one day the doctor came and told me that this operation is dangerous for me and if I don't operate it will be dangerous for me as well.
[899.84 --> 905.84]  And that day was one of the worst day of my life.
[905.84 --> 906.84]  I was scared.
[906.84 --> 908.84]  I lost hope.
[908.84 --> 919.84]  But a few days later, I received a message by Violet from a woman of God whom I didn't know at all.
[919.84 --> 923.84]  And she didn't know me as well.
[923.84 --> 927.84]  Which was really God's message to me.
[927.84 --> 930.84]  The message is that this...
[930.84 --> 932.84]  I will read for you.
[932.84 --> 935.84]  God is greater than your sickness.
[935.84 --> 938.84]  God can heal your body.
[938.84 --> 941.84]  God will get you through this.
[941.84 --> 950.84]  I just want to add my point about this lady. I have some communication with this lady.
[950.84 --> 959.84]  We don't know each other very well. Is that some Varaj sale, local communication, maybe some of you know about this app.
[959.84 --> 967.84]  Is that buying and selling the stuff? And we didn't know about each other.
[967.84 --> 979.84]  That is maybe the only thing that we know about each other is that both of us are Christians.
[979.84 --> 982.84]  That is just we know about each other.
[982.84 --> 988.84]  One day at that time that my mom was at the hospital, she sent this message.
[988.84 --> 991.84]  She didn't know about my mom that she is at the hospital.
[991.84 --> 998.84]  And she said, okay, I just text a message to me and said, I just put the stuff and put the money in the mailbox.
[998.84 --> 1001.84]  But I have some message for you. I don't know why.
[1001.84 --> 1010.84]  But this morning when I read my Facebook or something like this, God give me this message.
[1010.84 --> 1018.84]  And I prayed that this message is that for who? And God show you. And I just want to share this message to you.
[1018.84 --> 1023.84]  I don't know why. Maybe is that for you or for your family or your friends.
[1023.84 --> 1027.84]  I don't know why, but I feel this message is for you today.
[1027.84 --> 1034.84]  We wanted to invite this lady to this church today, but she couldn't come and it was so amazing.
[1034.84 --> 1041.84]  So I sent this message to my mom and I will continue to read my mom's testimony.
[1041.84 --> 1053.84]  After I received, this is my mom's testimony. After I received the message, my mind changed 100%.
[1053.84 --> 1062.84]  I kept repeating those sentences to myself and thinking about them.
[1062.84 --> 1071.84]  How God gave me a message just when I needed it. When through someone I didn't know.
[1071.84 --> 1080.84]  Before the operation and before I went to the operating room, I didn't receive any hopeful message from any doctors.
[1080.84 --> 1085.84]  But I was sure that God would protect me and heal me.
[1085.84 --> 1093.84]  And I just tell to myself that our God is the best doctor.
[1093.84 --> 1096.84]  Just, I want to add this part. Sorry about that.
[1096.84 --> 1104.84]  Because I just want to complete it. Because my mom, I, all of us was beside my mom all the time.
[1104.84 --> 1106.84]  So I can understand.
[1106.84 --> 1112.84]  All of, maybe some of you know that operation, it was very, very dangerous for my mom.
[1112.84 --> 1120.84]  And she was not in a good, physically, condition.
[1120.84 --> 1131.84]  And, but after receiving this message from that lady, from God, by through this lady,
[1131.84 --> 1148.84]  my mom was very calm and very peaceful. And I saw how God put his, put his seeds of peace and hope in hearts of children.
[1148.84 --> 1160.84]  After my operation, the doctor told Violet that the operation went very well.
[1160.84 --> 1166.84]  And that what we were worried about didn't happen.
[1166.84 --> 1178.84]  Two weeks later, the specialist, who is an Iranian doctor, said that I never told that your operation would be successful.
[1178.84 --> 1183.84]  And now I'm very happy that you are in my office and you are fine.
[1183.84 --> 1192.84]  My only purpose in sharing this testimony is that glory to God's name and to encourage you.
[1192.84 --> 1209.84]  Is that just for a glory of God?
[1209.84 --> 1230.84]  Thank you.
[1230.84 --> 1234.84]  Well, we just heard a wonderful testimony.
[1234.84 --> 1239.84]  Thank you, Fou, and for sharing that.
[1239.84 --> 1245.84]  And God has indeed traveled with you and as well with Mustafa throughout this journey.
[1245.84 --> 1247.84]  And you have been blessed in many ways.
[1247.84 --> 1252.84]  And we're all rejoicing with you in terms of your operation and your recovery.
[1252.84 --> 1254.84]  And certainly God was there with you.
[1254.84 --> 1257.84]  And we appreciate that all the more.
[1257.84 --> 1259.84]  And we get, we get comfort from that for sure.
[1259.84 --> 1261.84]  Truly an answer to prayer.
[1261.84 --> 1271.84]  We're going to be singing a song here that talks about our, our response would be to, to, to offer our blessing to the Lord as well.
[1271.84 --> 1273.84]  So that's the song we're going to sing.
[1273.84 --> 1278.84]  Maybe we can stand and we'll sing, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1278.84 --> 1280.84]  Worship his holy name.
[1280.84 --> 1282.84]  Sing like never before.
[1282.84 --> 1285.84]  Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1285.84 --> 1286.84]  Let's sing that.
[1286.84 --> 1304.84]  Let's sing that.
[1304.84 --> 1309.84]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[1309.84 --> 1314.84]  Worship his holy name.
[1314.84 --> 1318.84]  Sing like never before.
[1318.84 --> 1325.84]  Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1325.84 --> 1335.84]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[1335.84 --> 1340.84]  It's time to sing your song again.
[1340.84 --> 1347.84]  Whatever day pass and whatever lies before me.
[1347.84 --> 1355.84]  Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[1355.84 --> 1360.84]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[1360.84 --> 1366.84]  Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1366.84 --> 1370.84]  Sing like never before.
[1370.84 --> 1377.84]  Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1377.84 --> 1388.84]  You're rich in love and you're slow to anchor.
[1388.84 --> 1393.84]  Your name is great and your heart is light.
[1393.84 --> 1400.84]  For all your goodness, I will keep on singing.
[1400.84 --> 1401.84]  And I'll worship your holy name.
[1401.84 --> 1402.84]  Amen.
[1402.84 --> 1407.84]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[1407.84 --> 1408.84]  Amen.
[1408.84 --> 1410.84]  Amen.
[1410.84 --> 1413.84]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[1413.84 --> 1416.84]  Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[1416.84 --> 1421.84]  Worship his holy name.
[1421.84 --> 1425.84]  Sing like never before.
[1425.84 --> 1432.84]  Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1432.84 --> 1444.84]  And on that day when my strength is failing.
[1444.84 --> 1448.84]  The end draws near and my time has gone.
[1448.84 --> 1456.84]  Still my soul will sing your praise unending.
[1456.84 --> 1462.92]  Ten thousand years and men forever long.
[1465.54 --> 1471.46]  Blessed Lord of my soul, O Lord of my soul,
[1471.46 --> 1476.40]  Worship His holy name.
[1476.80 --> 1482.58]  Sing like never before, O Lord of my soul,
[1482.58 --> 1487.58]  O worship Your holy name.
[1488.58 --> 1493.58]  Worship Your holy name.
[1494.58 --> 1500.58]  Worship Your holy name.
[1512.58 --> 1514.58]  Worship Your holy name.
[1525.58 --> 1530.58]  we are a moment, you are forever,
[1530.58 --> 1541.08]  You are forever, Lord of the ages, God before time.
[1541.08 --> 1557.08]  We are a maker, you are eternal, love everlasting, wave on high.
[1557.08 --> 1572.96]  O holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the power of slain.
[1572.96 --> 1586.96]  I am cleansed, Father, and glory, here unto your name.
[1587.08 --> 1594.32]  Be unto your name.
[1596.32 --> 1603.30]  We are the broken, you are the healer.
[1603.30 --> 1610.30]  Jesus, we give her mighty to shame.
[1611.44 --> 1617.98]  You are the love song we'll sing forever.
[1617.98 --> 1626.98]  Bow with me for you, mercy is your name.
[1626.98 --> 1641.32]  Oh, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb of us.
[1641.32 --> 1649.56]  All His blessings, honor and glory.
[1649.56 --> 1651.56]  Be unto your name.
[1651.56 --> 1656.56]  Be unto your name.
[1656.56 --> 1660.56]  Be unto your name.
[1660.56 --> 1663.56]  Be unto your name.
[1663.56 --> 1667.56]  Be unto your name.
[1667.56 --> 1675.56]  Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb of us.
[1675.56 --> 1676.56]  The Lamb of us.
[1676.56 --> 1677.56]  The Lamb of us.
[1677.56 --> 1678.56]  The Lamb of us.
[1678.56 --> 1682.56]  All His blessings, honor and glory.
[1682.56 --> 1683.56]  Be unto your name.
[1683.56 --> 1684.56]  Thank you.
[1684.56 --> 1685.56]  You may be seated.
[1685.56 --> 1686.56]  Thank you.
[1686.56 --> 1687.56]  You may be seated.
[1687.56 --> 1689.56]  Thank you.
[1689.56 --> 1692.56]  You may be seated.
[1692.56 --> 1705.56]  You may be seated.
[1705.56 --> 1723.08]  And thank you again, Fau and Violet, for sharing this morning.
[1723.08 --> 1729.18]  That was very moving, a wonderful testimony, and it's amazing how God has answered prayer
[1729.18 --> 1731.32]  in your lives, and we give thanks for that.
[1735.56 --> 1740.44]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1740.44 --> 1744.78]  O promised Christ, we are a world at war.
[1744.78 --> 1748.02]  Our peace depends on your coming.
[1748.02 --> 1750.32]  We are a sinful people.
[1750.32 --> 1753.76]  Our pardon depends on your coming.
[1753.76 --> 1758.52]  We are full of good intentions, but weak at keeping promises.
[1758.52 --> 1764.00]  Our only hope of doing God's will is that you should come and help us do it.
[1764.00 --> 1767.16]  Lord Christ, word made flesh.
[1767.16 --> 1772.60]  Our world waits for your peace, for your pardon, and for your grace.
[1772.60 --> 1775.22]  Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1775.22 --> 1776.22]  Amen.
[1776.22 --> 1783.80]  And our confidence as Christians is that in Christ we have forgiveness of sins.
[1783.80 --> 1789.76]  We are reminded of that this morning with these words from Romans 8 and Corinthians 5.
[1789.76 --> 1791.50]  Hear the good news.
[1791.50 --> 1792.92]  Who is in a position to condemn?
[1792.92 --> 1795.24]  Only Christ.
[1795.24 --> 1797.22]  And Christ died for us.
[1797.22 --> 1799.08]  Christ rose for us.
[1799.08 --> 1802.04]  Christ reigns in power for us.
[1802.04 --> 1804.32]  Christ prays for us.
[1804.32 --> 1808.16]  Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.
[1808.16 --> 1810.00]  The old life has gone.
[1810.00 --> 1812.10]  A new life has begun.
[1812.10 --> 1816.44]  Know that you are forgiven and be at peace.
[1816.44 --> 1818.44]  Marvelous grace is our next song.
[1818.44 --> 1823.44]  And after that, all those involved in kids life, and I think it's age 3 through grade 5,
[1823.44 --> 1825.44]  are free to go to their classes.
[1825.44 --> 1836.36]  Beloved
[1836.36 --> 1842.44]  and even before Cain
[1842.44 --> 1848.24]  and beyond
[1848.24 --> 1849.24]  Amen.
[1878.24 --> 1880.24]  Amen.
[1908.24 --> 1910.24]  Amen.
[1938.24 --> 1940.24]  Amen.
[1968.24 --> 1969.24]  Amen.
[1998.24 --> 2000.24]  Amen.
[2028.24 --> 2029.24]  Amen.
[2035.74 --> 2038.28]  Amen.
[2039.28 --> 2043.68]  Amen.
[2043.68 --> 2046.32]  And the children are dismissed at this time.
[2049.92 --> 2054.04]  And while they're leaving, it's my pleasure to invite Pastor Len forward.
[2054.04 --> 2061.04]  He really needs no introduction, but still feels like the right thing to do invite him to this pulpit. So thank you, Pastor Lynn for joining us this morning
[2072.38 --> 2077.28]  Well, good morning. It is a delight to be back here. We're just saying in the
[2078.02 --> 2080.94]  Council room this morning. It's been a while. I think it's well over a year
[2080.94 --> 2084.50]  But you know you're blessed here now you have a pastor and
[2085.16 --> 2090.62]  So you don't need me and I was saying you probably got sick of me a couple of years ago and so
[2091.12 --> 2096.90]  But seriously, it's really a delight to be here. Nick and I have very fond memories of just being here
[2096.90 --> 2102.00]  We only were Sunday. I was only a Sunday preacher, but it felt like a lot more than that for a while
[2102.00 --> 2104.42]  So it's a pleasure to be with you again
[2104.68 --> 2110.30]  Now I'm going to be reading from the Beatitudes and then another piece from Matthew chapter 19
[2110.30 --> 2116.64]  Pastor Jason has told me they're going you guess you're going through the Beatitudes now and so we'll be taking up one of those
[2117.22 --> 2119.22]  chapter 5 verse 8 and
[2119.28 --> 2123.22]  Dorothy told me that you've been reading the Beatitudes responsibly so I
[2124.06 --> 2126.06]  Understand it's on page
[2126.06 --> 2128.52]  119 of the Bible. I think it'll be on the screen as well
[2129.24 --> 2131.24]  And I guess we will read it responsibly
[2131.84 --> 2139.44]  But not my verse and then next your verse it'll be my half verse and then your half verse and my
[2139.44 --> 2142.66]  Part of the verse will begin with the word blessed and
[2143.08 --> 2149.48]  Yours will begin with the word for for theirs or for they okay, so that makes perfect sense. I think
[2150.16 --> 2152.84]  Okay, the Beatitudes Jesus said verse 3
[2153.62 --> 2155.62]  blessed are the poor in spirit
[2159.04 --> 2161.04]  Blessed are those who mourn
[2161.04 --> 2168.26]  Maybe you should get your Bibles out page
[2168.26 --> 2173.72]  And that's page 719 okay
[2175.04 --> 2177.10]  They still have them here for a reason
[2183.82 --> 2190.68]  Now there is a chance that your if those are older ones there'll be wording that slightly different just read what you got in the Bible, okay?
[2190.68 --> 2197.90]  So beginning again verse 3 chapter 5 verse page 719
[2199.90 --> 2201.98]  Blessed are the poor in spirit
[2205.20 --> 2207.20]  Blessed are those who mourn
[2208.86 --> 2210.86]  Blessed are the meek
[2212.54 --> 2215.24]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[2215.24 --> 2217.24]  Blessed are the merciful
[2217.24 --> 2219.24]  Blessed are the merciful
[2219.24 --> 2220.24]  Blessed are the merciful
[2220.24 --> 2225.16]  And now our reading for today blessed are the pure in heart
[2228.12 --> 2230.12]  Blessed are the peacemakers
[2230.12 --> 2236.26]  And finally blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness
[2236.26 --> 2237.66]  Blessed are the for the Lord
[2237.66 --> 2239.22]  Blessed are the people who are
[2239.90 --> 2241.94]  Okay, then to page 733
[2241.94 --> 2245.82]  And then we're going to read a parable that Jesus taught
[2245.82 --> 2251.38]  Or no it's a sort of a story of Jesus and a particular rich young man
[2251.38 --> 2255.20]  So this begins at chapter 19 halfway through verse 16
[2255.20 --> 2258.50]  And in this particular edition of the
[2259.30 --> 2263.06]  New International Version it's called the rich and the kingdom of God
[2263.48 --> 2264.48]  Verse 19
[2264.48 --> 2271.28]  Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked teacher what good thing must I do to get eternal life?
[2272.16 --> 2274.80]  Why do you ask me about what is good?
[2274.80 --> 2277.04]  Jesus replied there was only one who was good
[2277.68 --> 2278.88]  If you want to enter
[2280.88 --> 2284.48]  Only if you want to enter life keep the commandments
[2285.04 --> 2286.80]  Which one he inquired?
[2286.80 --> 2289.12]  And Jesus replied you shall not murder
[2289.12 --> 2290.80]  You shall not commit adultery
[2290.80 --> 2292.32]  You shall not steal
[2292.32 --> 2294.48]  You shall not give false testimony
[2294.48 --> 2297.92]  Honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself
[2297.92 --> 2301.12]  All these have I kept the young man said
[2301.12 --> 2303.12]  What do I still lack?
[2304.24 --> 2306.48]  Jesus answered if you want to be perfect
[2306.48 --> 2308.48]  Go sell your possessions
[2308.48 --> 2311.76]  And give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven
[2311.76 --> 2314.08]  Then come follow me
[2314.08 --> 2317.84]  When the young man heard this he went away sad
[2317.84 --> 2319.92]  Because he had great wealth
[2320.88 --> 2322.40]  Then Jesus said to his disciples
[2322.80 --> 2326.96]  Truly I tell you it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven
[2327.92 --> 2332.64]  Again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[2332.64 --> 2336.40]  Than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God
[2337.52 --> 2341.20]  When his disciples heard this they were greatly astonished and asked
[2341.20 --> 2342.72]  Who then can be saved?
[2343.60 --> 2346.48]  Jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible
[2346.48 --> 2348.56]  But with God all things are possible
[2349.52 --> 2352.08]  Peter answered we have left everything to follow you
[2352.64 --> 2354.16]  What then will there be for us?
[2355.20 --> 2359.20]  And Jesus said to them truly I tell you with the renewal of all things
[2359.20 --> 2362.00]  When the son of man sits on his glorious throne
[2362.80 --> 2368.88]  You who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of israel
[2369.60 --> 2376.80]  And anyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake
[2377.44 --> 2382.24]  Will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life
[2383.04 --> 2389.44]  But many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first
[2390.40 --> 2394.48]  So Matthew chapter 19 that's the reading and this is the word of God
[2397.68 --> 2400.88]  You know many years ago I was a very new preacher
[2400.88 --> 2408.40]  I was a preacher on assignment in a small church in eastern Canada in the Maritimes
[2409.12 --> 2416.16]  And one Sunday after church Nick and I were invited to spend the day with the family on their farm
[2417.12 --> 2423.28]  And before the day was done I found myself in a milking parlor with a dairyman
[2423.28 --> 2427.28]  And we talked while he milked
[2428.40 --> 2430.64]  And he told me how to preach
[2431.84 --> 2432.80]  He's no I'm serious
[2432.80 --> 2433.84]  And one day he said
[2434.24 --> 2434.64]  He said
[2435.20 --> 2441.36]  You know this farm is a lot of work and I've got a lot of things to do and I've got a lot of things on my mind
[2442.40 --> 2446.96]  And and so when you preach make one point
[2447.84 --> 2451.92]  Just one one thing I can remember for the rest of the day
[2451.92 --> 2453.76]  And into the week
[2454.56 --> 2460.24]  Now obviously he did not expect me to repeat one line over and over for half an hour
[2460.80 --> 2464.48]  But he wanted me to take all that sermon material
[2464.48 --> 2469.12]  You know the biblical text and maybe some stories I might tell
[2469.84 --> 2472.72]  Maybe a poem or a quotation from somewhere
[2473.12 --> 2477.36]  And he wanted to make it all together as one
[2477.36 --> 2478.56]  And he said
[2478.56 --> 2485.12]  Now this was not a professional theologian teaching me biblical hermeneutics or homiletics
[2485.76 --> 2489.52]  No this was someone who sat in the pew on Sunday
[2489.52 --> 2492.56]  And wanted to take something good home
[2493.20 --> 2495.12]  And and at the end of the service
[2495.12 --> 2498.00]  And so he told me get to the point
[2498.96 --> 2500.32]  Stick to the point
[2501.04 --> 2501.44]  You know
[2501.44 --> 2502.64]  Explain your words
[2502.64 --> 2505.84]  And help me remember
[2507.28 --> 2509.52]  And at the time I thought that's really good advice
[2511.04 --> 2516.00]  And 40 years later it's still really good advice for preachers like myself
[2516.00 --> 2524.48]  But today I am going to disappoint the dairymen and have two points
[2526.16 --> 2530.56]  And the reason I have two is that Jesus gives us two
[2531.52 --> 2535.12]  He said blessed are the pure in heart
[2535.12 --> 2536.24]  That's one point
[2537.20 --> 2539.60]  For they will see God
[2540.24 --> 2541.12]  That's point two
[2541.12 --> 2543.84]  So let's look at both
[2544.88 --> 2547.12]  Blessed are the pure in heart
[2548.16 --> 2549.44]  What does that mean?
[2550.16 --> 2552.72]  What is this thing we call a heart?
[2553.20 --> 2556.72]  What does it mean to have one that is that is pure?
[2558.24 --> 2560.00]  Now you may have heard before that
[2560.96 --> 2563.28]  What the bible calls a heart
[2564.80 --> 2569.28]  Is not is not the anatomy class version of a heart
[2569.28 --> 2573.12]  It's not that bundle of muscles in your chest here that
[2573.12 --> 2576.80]  Pumps your blood through your body day after day every day
[2577.36 --> 2580.56]  Now in the bible's language the heart
[2581.76 --> 2584.16]  Is that of the center of your being
[2584.80 --> 2585.84]  Of your person
[2586.32 --> 2591.20]  It involves your thoughts and your emotions and your temperament
[2591.68 --> 2594.80]  It involves your deepest loves
[2594.80 --> 2598.80]  The things that control everything you do
[2599.60 --> 2604.72]  If you can look into a person's heart you'll understand their hopes
[2605.28 --> 2608.64]  And their wants and their disappointments
[2610.56 --> 2615.04]  Actually nowadays we use the word sort of in the same way too
[2615.68 --> 2620.40]  I mean when when when you say I love him with all my heart
[2621.12 --> 2623.44]  We're not talking human biology
[2623.44 --> 2627.52]  Now we're talking something that controls
[2628.40 --> 2631.28]  Everything we do our whole lives
[2632.08 --> 2635.60]  Kind of grow out of what is in our hearts
[2637.44 --> 2641.76]  Which would mean that being pure in heart is a very good thing
[2643.84 --> 2645.04]  And the opposite
[2645.68 --> 2648.80]  Being impure in heart is not a good thing
[2648.80 --> 2653.28]  It's like having an impure mind you know a mind full of junk
[2654.24 --> 2658.56]  You know full of movies filled with violence and f-bombs
[2658.56 --> 2664.72]  Full of porn and and and and and and other garbage
[2664.72 --> 2669.44]  I mean conspiracy theories from the dark side of the internet
[2669.44 --> 2670.96]  That sort of thing
[2670.96 --> 2678.96]  So yeah, there are all kinds of junk to put into your into your heart and your mind and
[2679.76 --> 2682.80]  Yes, it will do serious damage to you
[2684.88 --> 2692.72]  Now the best way to fix that is to have a pure mind and a pure heart is obviously to get rid of the junk
[2692.72 --> 2698.64]  It's like cleaning up your diet so you can have a healthier a more pure body
[2699.52 --> 2707.52]  So you get rid of all those super processed meals and all those snacks full of you know salt and vinegar
[2707.52 --> 2709.68]  And if you're smoking you quit you know
[2709.68 --> 2714.88]  Get that unhealthy stuff out of your body
[2716.16 --> 2717.84]  Now at first you might miss it
[2718.80 --> 2721.68]  You you might have to go through a bit of withdrawal
[2722.80 --> 2725.12]  But if you persist
[2726.32 --> 2732.16]  If you stick to it then eventually you'll you'll notice a difference
[2732.96 --> 2737.76]  You will feel better you will sleep better you will have more energy
[2737.76 --> 2741.68]  You might even look better and people will notice
[2742.88 --> 2747.68]  And they'll they might ask you have you been have you been making some changes
[2749.68 --> 2754.88]  Well if we can do that with the stuff we eat and the stuff we drink and inhale
[2755.68 --> 2758.48]  We can do it with the stuff we
[2759.12 --> 2764.88]  Read and and and watch and and talk about and do in our free time
[2764.88 --> 2769.60]  You know at first you might miss it you might go through some kind of withdrawal
[2769.76 --> 2775.20]  But if you stay with it if you persist then eventually
[2776.00 --> 2783.04]  You will feel better and and and you you will feel more pure in spirit
[2783.68 --> 2784.80]  And people might notice
[2786.24 --> 2787.52]  And they will say something
[2788.32 --> 2791.04]  Have you have you made some changes?
[2791.04 --> 2796.16]  Have you become maybe more religious?
[2796.96 --> 2798.32]  I mean in the best sense
[2802.56 --> 2804.00]  So all that makes good sense
[2805.76 --> 2806.56]  But there's more
[2808.48 --> 2815.84]  I will say that too think of a pure heart not only as the opposite of an impure heart
[2815.84 --> 2821.52]  But also as the opposite of a of a divided hearts
[2821.52 --> 2832.88]  A heart divided between two loves between two loyalties between two things that are more important to me than anything else in my life
[2835.12 --> 2836.00]  It's kind of hard to do
[2836.00 --> 2842.64]  You know our reading this morning told about a young man with a divided heart
[2843.60 --> 2849.68]  He came to jesus with a question a religious question about our final destiny
[2850.24 --> 2853.12]  about his final destiny
[2854.48 --> 2857.28]  What must I do to get eternal life?
[2858.80 --> 2865.76]  And from the sounds of it this was a sincere question it wasn't a trick question and that did sometimes happen with jesus but
[2866.24 --> 2871.92]  But here was a sincere one here was someone you could say he he wanted that that calm
[2872.56 --> 2876.48]  assurance in his in his moment of death
[2878.08 --> 2887.12]  And he wanted his I think he wanted his family to know that he died in faith and in hope because that would bring them great comfort
[2887.12 --> 2893.52]  But then jesus told him to go and sell all that he had and give to the poor and
[2893.52 --> 2901.36]  And then that great divide in his heart opened wide and he became sad jesus was asking a lot
[2902.00 --> 2904.00]  He was asking too much
[2904.00 --> 2906.80]  And you can just imagine this
[2907.44 --> 2916.00]  young man thinking about this great big estate sale at his property with all his prized possessions spread over the tables and
[2916.24 --> 2921.28]  People picking through his stuff and arguing the prices down and at the end
[2921.28 --> 2926.96]  It's all sold away and he takes a slow walk through that empty house and nothing left
[2926.96 --> 2933.36]  But dust bunnies and hangers on the wall and outside there's a sign that that house is for sale too
[2933.68 --> 2935.68]  everything goes to the poor
[2936.56 --> 2940.24]  And and and the rich man shrinks away from the idea
[2940.64 --> 2941.20]  I mean
[2941.20 --> 2944.72]  He can't do this who would want to do this
[2945.04 --> 2949.92]  He put his life and soul into this place so did his mother and father
[2949.92 --> 2954.32]  And now it it all has to go really?
[2958.56 --> 2962.08]  You know it was jesus asking too much from
[2963.28 --> 2964.96]  from him
[2965.12 --> 2967.12]  It's fair to ask
[2968.08 --> 2970.96]  It's also fair to ask you know it's fair to point out
[2971.68 --> 2977.20]  That there were other people in the bible who you know had great wealth
[2977.20 --> 2978.88]  And that was okay
[2980.48 --> 2981.20]  In fact
[2982.32 --> 2984.80]  Sometimes it was on purpose
[2986.56 --> 2989.84]  God made them very wealthy
[2990.72 --> 2992.88]  I mean job at first
[2993.92 --> 2995.44]  You know he was a rich man
[2996.32 --> 3003.12]  Who had a big family and lots of sheep and camels and oxen and donkeys
[3003.12 --> 3007.84]  And then he lost everything
[3008.64 --> 3010.96]  But stayed true to god
[3012.32 --> 3016.56]  And so in the end god made him twice as wealthy
[3016.56 --> 3018.16]  Twice as many sheep
[3018.16 --> 3019.92]  Twice as many camels
[3019.92 --> 3022.40]  Twice as many oxen and donkeys
[3022.40 --> 3024.72]  Along with a beautiful new family
[3025.60 --> 3028.48]  You know that all the land they said there were no
[3029.28 --> 3031.52]  Women more beautiful than the daughters of job
[3032.40 --> 3039.28]  You know so i mean doesn't god sometimes bless people even make them rich
[3042.48 --> 3043.92]  And yes that that is true
[3046.40 --> 3053.68]  But if you think that you know job getting rich twice over is the takeaway message of the book
[3053.68 --> 3056.40]  Then you've you've missed the point
[3058.16 --> 3060.32]  I mean don't think of joe
[3061.28 --> 3065.44]  You know with his beautiful family and his flocks and his herds
[3065.44 --> 3069.36]  No think of joe on the ash heap
[3070.96 --> 3072.96]  You know with nothing
[3074.08 --> 3075.84]  Counting his losses
[3077.12 --> 3078.96]  Grieving his children
[3078.96 --> 3084.00]  Scraping his sores with a piece of broken pottery
[3084.72 --> 3088.96]  I mean he job stayed faithful then too
[3089.60 --> 3091.44]  Even especially then
[3092.24 --> 3094.40]  I mean he had questions he wasn't happy
[3095.12 --> 3100.40]  He complained to god very loudly when his friends started to explain why it was all happening
[3100.40 --> 3104.72]  He batted them away he would not take bad explanations
[3104.72 --> 3110.00]  But he would not let god go
[3111.76 --> 3112.56]  His heart
[3112.56 --> 3115.28]  Was not divided
[3117.12 --> 3118.56]  It stayed pure
[3123.84 --> 3126.24]  Okay now we should go to the second point
[3127.12 --> 3129.68]  With apologies to the dairyman out east
[3129.68 --> 3134.80]  Jesus said you know blessed are the pure in heart
[3135.84 --> 3137.12]  For they will see
[3138.00 --> 3138.56]  God
[3140.08 --> 3145.28]  Now i'm going to admit I have read that parable that that beatitude for years and years
[3146.16 --> 3151.68]  And I never really stopped to think what does that mean to see
[3152.32 --> 3152.88]  God
[3153.68 --> 3155.84]  I mean isn't that supposed to be impossible I mean
[3155.84 --> 3160.64]  God is not some great big thing way up there
[3161.36 --> 3166.08]  That we can find with I don't know the James Webb space telescope you know
[3166.08 --> 3173.12]  Just take the thing point the camera take a click check the picture and there he is up there between those two galaxies
[3173.84 --> 3174.08]  No
[3176.08 --> 3176.88]  Not at all
[3178.64 --> 3180.24]  Into the belgic confession
[3180.24 --> 3184.80]  One of the confessions of our christian reformed church
[3184.80 --> 3187.52]  It it it begins with a description
[3188.08 --> 3189.12]  Of god
[3189.12 --> 3189.60]  Here it is
[3190.16 --> 3199.68]  We all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being
[3199.68 --> 3200.64]  whom we call
[3201.52 --> 3201.92]  God
[3202.80 --> 3203.84]  Eternal
[3203.84 --> 3205.28]  Incomprehensible
[3205.28 --> 3206.00]  Invisible
[3206.32 --> 3207.52]  Unchangeable
[3207.52 --> 3208.16]  Infinite
[3208.16 --> 3208.80]  Almighty
[3208.80 --> 3209.76]  Almighty
[3209.76 --> 3211.84]  Completely wise just
[3212.40 --> 3212.96]  And good
[3213.52 --> 3216.40]  And the overflowing fountain
[3217.04 --> 3218.00]  Of all good
[3219.28 --> 3220.24]  I mean those words
[3221.28 --> 3222.72]  They fill me with awe
[3225.52 --> 3228.00]  They also include words like infinite
[3228.80 --> 3230.24]  And incomprehensible
[3230.96 --> 3232.08]  And invisible
[3232.08 --> 3237.68]  So obviously to say that we can see god
[3237.68 --> 3239.52]  It
[3239.52 --> 3241.76]  It has a particular meaning
[3244.88 --> 3246.56]  Now some commentaries point out that
[3246.56 --> 3249.36]  That that this is in the future tense
[3249.36 --> 3253.04]  So those who are pure in heart will see god
[3253.60 --> 3256.00]  This is going to happen
[3257.76 --> 3259.20]  And that brings to mind
[3259.20 --> 3262.64]  Well certain events in the life of jesus
[3264.56 --> 3266.64]  For instance his his ascension
[3267.28 --> 3270.16]  Maybe the book of acts begins by telling us about those days
[3270.16 --> 3274.88]  Days after the resurrection on easter and before jesus ascended
[3275.20 --> 3276.64]  He met with the disciples
[3276.64 --> 3280.56]  He told them that they were going to be his witnesses in jerusalem
[3280.56 --> 3283.60]  And in judea and to the ends of the earth
[3284.80 --> 3285.52]  And then this
[3286.48 --> 3291.44]  He said after he said this he was taken up before their very eyes
[3291.44 --> 3294.80]  And a cloud hit them from their sight
[3294.80 --> 3298.88]  So we see this small group of disciples looking up at the sky
[3299.36 --> 3303.76]  Watching their master their jesus kind of fade away
[3305.20 --> 3306.88]  You know and and and then
[3308.08 --> 3312.24]  We're told suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them
[3313.20 --> 3318.00]  Men of galilee they asked why do you stand there looking up into the sky
[3318.00 --> 3328.64]  Why this same jesus who has been taking up from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go
[3329.60 --> 3332.48]  So that's a biblical promise one day
[3333.04 --> 3336.64]  We will see jesus again
[3337.60 --> 3341.04]  And so now we can kind of connect the dots
[3341.84 --> 3345.68]  And and and say that if we keep our hearts pure
[3345.68 --> 3357.92]  And keep our hearts undivided then we will wait in faith and hope for that glorious day when we will see him
[3361.84 --> 3364.08]  And that sounds right doesn't it
[3366.56 --> 3368.80]  But again there's something more
[3368.80 --> 3380.24]  Not only do we wait to see jesus again in the future we can hope to see we can hope to see god
[3381.28 --> 3382.24]  Here and now
[3384.08 --> 3389.60]  It it just involves a particular kind of of of seeing
[3390.80 --> 3394.40]  And and we sometimes use the word that way ourselves
[3395.20 --> 3401.68]  You know with that different kind of seeing so when we say I see what we really mean is I
[3403.28 --> 3405.44]  Yeah, I understand it
[3406.40 --> 3408.40]  I get it
[3408.96 --> 3415.52]  If someone explains a complicated piece of human biology, you know how the air you breathe
[3416.16 --> 3423.60]  And the food you eat it kind of gets processed by the body until it becomes nutrients in your blood
[3424.40 --> 3434.24]  Which your heart I mean the one in the anatomy pictures which your heart pumps through a whole network of veins and capillaries
[3434.24 --> 3444.72]  To feed every part of your body bone and muscle and organ tissue and even your brain a huge amount of blood gets used there
[3445.52 --> 3454.96]  It is extremely complex and it works beautifully and it is all hidden underneath your skin
[3455.76 --> 3457.84]  You can't see it
[3459.60 --> 3465.12]  And then someone who knows all about the human body explains how it works and you say really
[3465.12 --> 3468.96]  Now I see
[3470.72 --> 3471.92]  But actually you don't see
[3472.96 --> 3474.96]  You just you understand
[3477.60 --> 3485.92]  Well according to jesus beatitude the pure in heart will see him they will come to understand him
[3485.92 --> 3494.72]  They'll understand his awesome greatness and his commanding power and his creation of the forces of the universe
[3495.76 --> 3499.44]  And then also his care and his kindness
[3500.56 --> 3502.96]  His love for his sons and daughters
[3504.64 --> 3508.48]  His often prodigal sons and daughters
[3508.48 --> 3509.68]  We all wander
[3509.68 --> 3518.72]  We all sin and fall short of the ideal we are all guilty and yet deep in the heart of god there is this this kindness
[3519.52 --> 3520.48]  That will not
[3521.36 --> 3522.24]  Let us go
[3524.40 --> 3527.68]  And by grace we can come to understand that
[3529.92 --> 3530.80]  See that
[3530.80 --> 3539.68]  I find myself thinking of martin luther the reformer in his early life in the monastery
[3540.40 --> 3546.64]  You know luther went through a kind of very sudden conversion type experience as a student
[3546.64 --> 3548.24]  He was caught in a thunderstorm
[3548.88 --> 3555.28]  And he he was in terror and he cried out and made a promise and if he was spared he would become a monk
[3556.72 --> 3560.08]  And uh well he was spared and he became a monk
[3560.96 --> 3564.16]  And as it turned out he became a very dedicated monk
[3564.96 --> 3570.08]  He uh he was very earnest and he tried very very hard
[3570.80 --> 3573.84]  And the reason is because for him
[3574.88 --> 3578.88]  God was not so much a kind and gentle father
[3579.76 --> 3583.52]  But a stern and angry judge
[3584.32 --> 3590.72]  And luther did everything he possibly could to please this stern and angry judge
[3590.80 --> 3597.60]  He he spent long hours in prayer he fasted he he slept in a
[3598.16 --> 3600.32]  cold room in the monastery
[3600.88 --> 3604.56]  He went to confession and confessed everything
[3605.20 --> 3605.60]  again
[3606.24 --> 3612.48]  And then he'd go back and do it again and then again and his confessors became tired of him
[3612.48 --> 3618.64]  You know he he once said if ever a monk got into heaven by monkery
[3619.52 --> 3620.08]  It was me
[3621.60 --> 3624.00]  And yet he always felt god
[3625.12 --> 3626.56]  Looking down on him
[3627.60 --> 3628.96]  With disappointment
[3630.24 --> 3631.20]  In anger
[3632.72 --> 3633.84]  With judgment
[3633.84 --> 3640.56]  Well his peers in the monastery decide to try a working cure
[3641.60 --> 3644.24]  They appointed him a teacher of the bible
[3644.24 --> 3648.96]  And so he started to study the scriptures
[3648.96 --> 3652.72]  He began with the psalms because they use them in their prayers
[3653.44 --> 3654.80]  Every day at the monastery
[3654.80 --> 3657.12]  And then he went into the letters of paul
[3658.08 --> 3660.32]  You know galatians romans
[3661.20 --> 3662.08]  Ephesians
[3662.08 --> 3669.04]  Until one day he there was luther bent over his desk
[3670.24 --> 3673.92]  Reading and rereading the words of paul
[3675.36 --> 3679.92]  To the romans paul said now apart from the law
[3681.28 --> 3686.72]  The righteousness of god has been made known to which the law and prophets testified
[3687.52 --> 3696.16]  This righteousness is given by faith in christ jesus to all who believe
[3696.88 --> 3700.56]  All have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
[3700.56 --> 3710.08]  And all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
[3710.08 --> 3718.32]  And then for luther the light came on
[3719.92 --> 3722.00]  And the world changed
[3723.04 --> 3726.88]  Or at least his understanding of god changed
[3726.88 --> 3731.12]  This was not a stern and angry judge
[3731.12 --> 3737.52]  And god's righteousness was not something that that he that that luther had to do
[3737.52 --> 3741.20]  And said it was something that god gave
[3743.92 --> 3745.84]  Freely gave to us
[3747.12 --> 3752.88]  Paul told the ephesians for by grace you are saved through faith
[3753.68 --> 3763.36]  And this is not your own doing it is a gift from god not by works so that no one can boast
[3763.36 --> 3768.32]  So for years luther had this long
[3769.36 --> 3774.88]  Desperate craving for for grace for the kindness of god
[3774.88 --> 3780.88]  You can say that that his need was undivided his desire was pure
[3782.32 --> 3783.36]  until finally
[3784.80 --> 3786.00]  After years of
[3786.96 --> 3788.72]  of lonely struggle
[3788.72 --> 3792.56]  Luther came to understand
[3794.72 --> 3797.12]  Now he said i can see
[3801.92 --> 3803.28]  Can can can you see
[3804.08 --> 3805.04]  God that way
[3806.72 --> 3809.52]  Can can you see him in jesus
[3810.80 --> 3817.44]  Who said come to me all you are weary and heavily burdened and i will give you rest
[3817.44 --> 3824.48]  This is the jesus who said do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also
[3825.04 --> 3825.52]  in me
[3826.32 --> 3834.96]  The promise of jesus is that those who are pure in heart will experience the deep wide love of god
[3834.96 --> 3837.20]  Because those who are pure in heart
[3838.08 --> 3839.68]  Are looking for him
[3839.68 --> 3847.44]  And those who seek will find and those who ask will receive and those who knock
[3847.44 --> 3849.04]  For them
[3849.04 --> 3852.72]  The door will be opened
[3852.72 --> 3858.24]  Let's pray together
[3858.24 --> 3864.24]  Lord you promise that for those who are pure in heart
[3865.12 --> 3867.84]  Whose need for you and desire for you is
[3868.96 --> 3870.72]  First and foremost in life
[3871.84 --> 3873.52]  That you will answer that need
[3874.16 --> 3875.04]  And come near
[3876.16 --> 3880.64]  And then all the rest of life somehow fits into its proper place
[3880.64 --> 3882.56]  Oh lord
[3884.00 --> 3886.56]  Give us that holy desire for you
[3888.40 --> 3889.68]  And help us to see you
[3891.52 --> 3892.80]  In the face of jesus
[3893.68 --> 3895.04]  In his name amen
[3899.04 --> 3908.64]  Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven the words of jesus
[3908.64 --> 3935.82]  Because the
[3935.82 --> 3940.22]  first the kingdom of God
[3940.22 --> 3943.78]  and His righteousness.
[3946.66 --> 3949.86]  And all these things shall be
[3949.86 --> 3953.82]  added unto you. Allelu,
[3955.12 --> 3957.82]  Alleluia.
[3957.82 --> 3963.76]  Christ and it shall be
[3963.76 --> 3965.82]  given unto you.
[3966.96 --> 3969.84]  See where you shall
[3969.84 --> 3973.82]  find. Open
[3973.82 --> 3977.82]  the door shall be opened unto you.
[3979.82 --> 3983.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[3983.82 --> 3991.82]  We do not live by breath alone,
[3993.44 --> 3997.82]  but by every word.
[3999.42 --> 4005.08]  And proceed from the mouth of God.
[4005.82 --> 4010.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[4010.82 --> 4017.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[4017.82 --> 4023.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[4023.82 --> 4029.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[4029.82 --> 4036.82]  Allelu, Alleluia.
[4036.82 --> 4049.82]  Alleluia, Alleluia.
[4049.82 --> 4060.06]  Our offering this morning is for Resonate Global Missions, and in particular the Umrans
[4060.06 --> 4062.58]  as they work to spread the gospel in Egypt.
[4062.58 --> 4065.48]  So I invite our deacons to take that offering at this time.
[4079.82 --> 4081.82]  Amen.

[4263.82 --> 4264.82]  Amen.
[4264.82 --> 4265.82]  Amen.
[4265.82 --> 4268.82]  Please join me in prayer.
[4268.82 --> 4275.94]  O great God, glorify yourself in all the earth.
[4275.94 --> 4278.66]  Be glorified in creation.
[4278.66 --> 4281.12]  Be glorified in your church.
[4281.12 --> 4284.54]  Be glorified in our worship here this very morning.
[4284.54 --> 4288.18]  But we are so small and you are so grand.
[4288.18 --> 4291.82]  Help us nevertheless to magnify your name.
[4291.82 --> 4296.78]  Help us to make your name and the nature of your grace larger and easier for people to
[4296.78 --> 4297.78]  see.
[4297.78 --> 4303.04]  Help us to live and to worship in such a way that we can become like magnifying glasses
[4303.04 --> 4308.12]  through which our neighbors and coworkers and children and friends can see you come
[4308.12 --> 4312.82]  into focus in ways they may not have seen before.
[4312.82 --> 4315.74]  Please bless the leadership of our congregation.
[4315.74 --> 4321.80]  Anoint them by your spirit and may they feel that anointing as they do sometimes difficult,
[4321.80 --> 4326.06]  sometimes joyful, but always holy work.
[4326.06 --> 4330.82]  We think of the needs of others at this time, O Lord, and we are embarrassed by our selfishness.
[4330.82 --> 4336.04]  May the answer to our prayers begin with us to redeem the times.
[4336.04 --> 4341.28]  Bring to all those who are in need the alleviation of their poverty or comfort for their minds and
[4341.28 --> 4343.26]  spirits.
[4343.26 --> 4347.96]  Enable us to do what we can to help them, to share our own happiness and prosperity, to
[4347.96 --> 4354.88]  provide a listening ear or friendly word, to do errands or other acts of kindness.
[4354.88 --> 4359.86]  We give thanks for the answer to prayer made evident in the healing progress of Quinn and continue
[4359.86 --> 4363.34]  to pray for full recovery for him.
[4363.34 --> 4368.64]  We thank you that Val was able to join us this morning and share her testimony of her
[4368.64 --> 4369.86]  difficult journey.
[4369.86 --> 4372.86]  Truly, you've answered prayer in her life.
[4372.86 --> 4379.34]  And just pray for your blessing on her as she continues to her recovery.
[4379.34 --> 4382.54]  We pray also for those dear to us who are sick or troubled.
[4382.54 --> 4386.84]  And particularly, we hold up before you this morning Jordan and Vanessa Vental.
[4386.84 --> 4391.36]  Give them both strength as Jordan goes through treatments for cancer and we pray for full
[4391.36 --> 4392.82]  healing for Jordan.
[4392.82 --> 4399.28]  We pray for my sister Amy as she faces the prospect of treatments for lung cancer amidst other complications
[4399.28 --> 4400.82]  to her health.
[4400.82 --> 4403.82]  Please grant her strength of body and mind through these times.
[4403.82 --> 4408.00]  We pray for a full recovery for her.
[4408.00 --> 4411.80]  We continue to pray for Pastor Nancy as she recovers from surgery.
[4411.80 --> 4417.22]  Grant her full healing and return to the work she loves in due time.
[4417.22 --> 4422.26]  We pray for healing for Eileen Rideout and Grace and your continued presence alongside all
[4422.26 --> 4427.06]  those who are too sick or too frail to join us in worship.
[4427.06 --> 4432.94]  We continue to pray for Robin who still misses her mother Melanie constantly and we just pray
[4432.94 --> 4434.26]  for comfort for her.
[4434.26 --> 4437.18]  She has gone through a difficult time.
[4437.18 --> 4441.26]  We pray for the world into which you came and which you still love.
[4441.26 --> 4444.14]  We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine.
[4444.14 --> 4448.88]  We pray for your wisdom and your spirit to work in the hearts of the leaders to find a
[4448.88 --> 4455.78]  path forward to end this conflict and to move from destroying to rebuilding.
[4455.78 --> 4460.10]  We pray for the Umarans and their work within Resonate Global Missions.
[4460.10 --> 4465.60]  Please bless them and their efforts to spread your message in Egypt.
[4465.60 --> 4468.92]  We thank you Lord for the beauty of your creation.
[4468.92 --> 4471.60]  For the signs of spring we see around us.
