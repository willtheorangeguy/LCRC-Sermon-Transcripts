[1158.38 → 1188.36] Thank you.
[1188.36 → 1218.34] Thank you.
[1218.34 → 1248.32] Thank you.
[1248.34 → 1278.32] Thank you.
[1278.34 → 1308.32] Thank you.
[1308.34 → 1338.32] Thank you.
[1338.32 → 1368.30] Thank you.
[1368.32 → 1398.30] Amen.
[1398.32 → 1428.32] Thank you.
[1428.32 → 1458.32] 
[1458.32 → 1488.30] Thank you.
[1488.32 → 1518.30] We ask you.
[1518.30 → 1548.28] Thank you.
[1548.28 → 1578.26] Thank you.
[1578.26 → 1608.24] Thank you.
[1608.24 → 1638.22] This is what I'm going to say,
[1638.22 → 1668.20] Thank you.
[1668.20 → 1698.18] Thank you.
[1698.20 → 1728.18] Thank you.
[1728.20 → 1758.18] Thank you.
[1758.20 → 1788.18] Thank you.
[1788.20 → 1818.18] Thank you.
[1818.18 → 1848.16] Thank you.
[1848.18 → 1878.16] Amen.
[1878.18 → 1908.16] So,
[1908.18 → 1938.18] 
[1938.18 → 1942.06] so that you might feast with us at some point in the future.
[1942.42 → 1945.84] And I'd love to talk to you about that, if that describes you this morning.
[1947.50 → 1951.60] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1952.38 → 1955.42] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1955.42 → 1957.40] This is my body, which is for you.
[1958.22 → 1960.46] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1961.52 → 1964.84] The same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1964.96 → 1967.18] This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[1967.98 → 1972.50] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1973.32 → 1976.66] For whenever you eat this bread, and you drink this cup,
[1977.22 → 1980.50] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1982.34 → 1983.70] Let me pray for us.
[1987.70 → 1991.56] Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you in praise.
[1992.84 → 1996.44] We lift our hearts to you in adoration and in awe.
[1997.18 → 2003.78] At things that are beyond our comprehension and yet are revealed to us.
[2003.78 → 2012.94] Lord, as we come to your table, would you prepare our hearts to receive you by faith?
[2014.14 → 2018.24] Lord, set apart this bread and this cup for your purposes.
[2019.24 → 2023.48] Would your spirit be at work in the lives of those who call on you by faith?
[2023.48 → 2027.28] That our hearts would be joined to Jesus Christ,
[2027.76 → 2032.98] who this very morning sits at your right hand, making intercession for us.
[2034.02 → 2039.82] Father, bless this meal for the glory of your name and the good of your people.
[2040.36 → 2042.08] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2043.08 → 2043.54] Amen.
[2043.54 → 2047.64] And so let's say our communion liturgy together.
[2047.92 → 2049.02] The words will be on the screen.
[2049.92 → 2050.96] Lift your hearts.
[2051.66 → 2052.70] Lift your hearts.
[2053.70 → 2055.30] We are his people.
[2056.02 → 2058.44] We are redeemed by his deeds.
[2058.98 → 2061.36] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[2062.24 → 2063.24] Christ has died.
[2063.76 → 2064.76] Christ is risen.
[2065.34 → 2066.92] Christ will come again.
[2067.86 → 2071.26] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[2071.64 → 2071.98] Hallelujah.
[2072.80 → 2073.36] Hallelujah.
[2074.34 → 2078.00] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[2078.60 → 2082.42] Come and feast with Thanksgiving in your hearts.
[2082.80 → 2087.64] So as the elders come forward to help us distribute the elements,
[2087.64 → 2094.08] again, I'll remind you that all baptized people are to take of the elements as they are offered to you.
[2094.08 → 2098.98] And this includes baptized children at the discretion of the parents.
[2098.98 → 2102.34] Let us pray.
[2102.38 → 2102.94] Yes.
[2102.94 → 2103.48] Let us pray.
[2111.74 → 2112.02] Amen.
[2114.66 → 2114.88] Amen.
[2115.34 → 2115.62] Amen.
[2115.62 → 2116.40] Amen.
[2116.46 → 2117.84] Amen.
[2118.44 → 2119.24] Amen.
[2124.18 → 2126.70] Amen.
[2126.70 → 2127.70] Amen.
[2156.70 → 2157.70] Amen.
[2186.70 → 2188.70] Amen.
[2216.70 → 2218.70] Amen.
[2246.70 → 2248.70] Amen.
[2276.70 → 2278.70] Amen.
[2306.70 → 2307.70] Amen.
[2307.70 → 2308.70] Amen.
[2308.70 → 2309.70] Amen.
[2309.70 → 2310.70] Amen.
[2310.70 → 2316.70] Brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus
[2316.70 → 2317.70] was broken for us.
[2317.70 → 2319.70] Let's eat together.
[2336.70 → 2337.70] Amen.
[2366.70 → 2367.70] Amen.
[2396.70 → 2397.70] Amen.
[2426.70 → 2427.70] Amen.
[2456.70 → 2457.70] Amen.
[2486.70 → 2487.70] Amen.
[2487.70 → 2489.70] Amen.
[2516.70 → 2525.10] ...
[2525.10 → 2526.14] ...
[2528.14 → 2529.54] ...
[2529.54 → 2531.86] ...
[2532.14 → 2533.54] ...
[2542.94 → 2543.06] ...
[2544.06 → 2551.96] Brothers and sisters in the Lord, take, drink, remember and believe that the blood for Lord Jesus was shed for the remission of all of our sins.
[2552.32 → 2553.04] Let us drink together.
[2559.96 → 2560.76] Let's pray.
[2562.90 → 2572.84] Heavenly Father, we thank you for feeding us with this spiritual food, the most precious body and blood of your Son, our Saviour.
[2573.28 → 2573.98] Jesus Christ.
[2574.98 → 2583.42] And for assuring us in these holy mysteries that we are living members of the body of your Son and heirs of your eternal kingdom.
[2584.22 → 2589.26] To him and to you and to the Holy Spirit be honour and glory now and forever.
[2590.06 → 2590.20] Amen.
[2593.26 → 2593.88] All right.
[2593.98 → 2599.76] So may I invite the children to come and join me right up front for a little message.
[2599.76 → 2603.76] Have a seat right here.
[2615.98 → 2616.26] Hey.
[2616.56 → 2617.40] Mr. Elf.
[2617.76 → 2618.08] Yeah.
[2618.36 → 2619.10] I want to have him.
[2619.40 → 2620.52] You can hold him, okay?
[2620.80 → 2621.00] Yeah.
[2621.26 → 2621.96] You can hold him for me.
[2622.04 → 2622.64] I want to touch it.
[2623.54 → 2624.10] I want to touch it.
[2624.10 → 2624.50] Touch it.
[2624.50 → 2624.72] Okay.
[2624.80 → 2625.68] Why don't we pass it around?
[2626.04 → 2626.40] Touch.
[2626.50 → 2626.86] You touched.
[2627.00 → 2627.14] Okay.
[2627.34 → 2627.54] Awesome.
[2627.54 → 2628.86] Wait, we're passing it.
[2629.36 → 2630.68] Well, actually, don't pass it yet.
[2631.26 → 2631.48] All right.
[2631.94 → 2632.68] Have a seat.
[2632.80 → 2633.32] Hey, everyone.
[2635.12 → 2635.48] Hello.
[2635.48 → 2635.54] Hello.
[2638.66 → 2639.40] All right.
[2640.70 → 2642.04] Nice to see you all today.
[2644.30 → 2644.82] All right.
[2645.24 → 2646.16] How are you all today?
[2646.56 → 2646.80] Good.
[2646.80 → 2648.28] Are you looking forward to Christmas?
[2648.84 → 2649.10] Yeah.
[2649.70 → 2650.92] I brought a friend.
[2651.24 → 2653.20] Actually, this is his second appearance.
[2653.38 → 2654.14] Let me see.
[2654.20 → 2654.78] I have to hold him up.
[2655.16 → 2658.08] This is his second appearance in our church this week.
[2659.10 → 2660.36] Do you know who this is?
[2660.54 → 2661.32] Mr. Gnome.
[2661.76 → 2662.78] It is a Mr. Gnome.
[2662.90 → 2663.74] That's what I thought.
[2663.94 → 2668.46] And so my family, we named him Norman the Gnome.
[2668.90 → 2669.72] Norman the Gnome.
[2670.28 → 2672.08] But you know what the tag said?
[2672.72 → 2674.12] It said he is Santa Claus.
[2675.26 → 2675.80] Can you believe it?
[2675.80 → 2677.08] Does he look like Santa Claus to you?
[2677.50 → 2677.90] No.
[2678.32 → 2678.90] Not really.
[2679.06 → 2679.60] But you know what?
[2679.64 → 2680.62] He is Santa Claus.
[2681.04 → 2681.48] So we'll just.
[2682.24 → 2683.08] He's Santa Claus Gnome.
[2684.54 → 2686.94] And so that was making me think.
[2687.76 → 2692.74] Do you know the song Santa Claus is Coming to Town?
[2693.96 → 2694.66] You do?
[2694.92 → 2695.62] How does it go?
[2696.88 → 2698.24] He's making a list.
[2698.94 → 2700.20] He's checking it twice.
[2700.86 → 2702.72] He's going to find out who is what?
[2702.72 → 2703.72] Naughty.
[2704.28 → 2706.30] Naughty or nice.
[2706.92 → 2707.36] Yeah.
[2707.46 → 2708.88] Santa Claus comes to school sometimes.
[2709.58 → 2712.46] So Santa Claus, he has two lists.
[2713.28 → 2714.30] What's one list?
[2715.22 → 2716.08] Naughty list.
[2716.22 → 2716.98] What's the other list?
[2717.94 → 2718.34] Nice.
[2718.50 → 2719.82] Which list are you all on?
[2720.52 → 2721.12] Nice.
[2721.64 → 2722.12] Nice?
[2722.84 → 2723.28] Okay.
[2723.28 → 2730.62] Well, the thing is, sometimes we think about God in the same way as we think about Santa.
[2730.72 → 2735.82] Sometimes we think of God as having a list of people who are naughty or nice.
[2736.60 → 2737.30] But, yeah?
[2737.50 → 2739.94] Because Christmas is about God.
[2740.48 → 2741.70] Christmas is about God.
[2741.84 → 2744.28] But the thing is, God is not like that at all.
[2744.40 → 2745.72] God is not like Santa Claus.
[2745.72 → 2752.66] Because the truth is, all of us are actually on God's naughty list.
[2753.30 → 2753.78] Yeah.
[2754.00 → 2754.66] I know.
[2755.82 → 2756.30] Yeah.
[2756.42 → 2757.80] We're all on God's naughty list.
[2758.04 → 2758.64] Even you?
[2758.82 → 2759.50] Even me.
[2760.78 → 2761.22] What?
[2761.50 → 2762.34] Especially me.
[2763.76 → 2769.22] But the thing is, so this is what the Bible says in Romans chapter 6, verse 23.
[2769.36 → 2772.18] So all of these people are on our naughty list?
[2772.18 → 2772.40] Yeah.
[2772.52 → 2772.98] Look at them.
[2773.66 → 2774.40] All of them are.
[2774.92 → 2776.16] Even your parents.
[2776.70 → 2776.94] Right?
[2777.52 → 2779.36] But this is what the Bible says.
[2779.44 → 2781.22] The wages of sin is death.
[2781.30 → 2786.16] That means because we're all on the naughty list, we deserve, because of our sin, because
[2786.16 → 2792.22] we disobey God, we disobey our parents, stuff like that, we all deserve to be on the
[2792.22 → 2792.72] naughty list.
[2792.82 → 2794.32] But here's what the verse says.
[2795.20 → 2801.68] The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ.
[2802.18 → 2803.42] The gift of God.
[2803.50 → 2805.62] So when we think about, you know, Santa Claus brings gifts, right?
[2807.14 → 2810.70] God gives us the best gift ever.
[2811.06 → 2817.72] The most valuable, the most amazing gift, and the gift he gives us is eternal life.
[2818.58 → 2819.44] Life in Jesus.
[2819.96 → 2824.10] So that means he takes us all from the naughty list, and where does he move us to?
[2825.04 → 2826.36] The nice list.
[2826.36 → 2828.08] Because of Jesus.
[2828.18 → 2831.26] When we put our faith in Jesus, he moves us all to the nice list.
[2831.66 → 2835.20] And it's not because necessarily that we're always nice, but because of Jesus.
[2835.84 → 2838.34] So we put our faith in him, and he gives us that gift.
[2838.54 → 2840.36] So what then are we always nice?
[2840.36 → 2842.12] Well, it's good.
[2842.20 → 2845.72] Then because of God's gift to us, we could try to be nice, right?
[2845.76 → 2846.48] As much as we can.
[2847.18 → 2851.50] We'll make mistakes still sometimes, right?
[2851.50 → 2857.68] But when we trust in Jesus, we have the greatest gift of all, which is eternal life.
[2859.30 → 2859.76] I don't know.
[2859.78 → 2860.14] They're missing.
[2860.64 → 2860.84] Okay.
[2861.64 → 2865.90] So when you see Santa Claus, wherever you see Santa Claus, what I want you to think about
[2865.90 → 2869.54] is God, the greatest gift giver ever.
[2869.66 → 2870.84] Santa's not the greatest gift giver.
[2870.96 → 2872.20] God is the greatest gift giver.
[2872.52 → 2873.50] And he gives us Jesus.
[2874.04 → 2874.28] Okay?
[2874.96 → 2875.32] Okay.
[2875.56 → 2876.44] Can you remember that for me?
[2877.32 → 2878.52] His eyes are on.
[2878.60 → 2879.02] His eyes are on.
[2879.06 → 2879.18] Ready?
[2879.24 → 2879.60] Let's pray.
[2880.22 → 2885.04] Lord, I pray for these kids and for all of us, Lord, that we would look to you as the
[2885.04 → 2889.98] the greatest gift giver because you have given us eternal life through Jesus Christ.
[2890.56 → 2894.18] We pray that you'd help us to remember that and rejoice in it.
[2894.52 → 2895.52] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2895.60 → 2895.80] Amen.
[2896.64 → 2897.08] Okay.
[2897.40 → 2898.56] He's also praying.
[2898.70 → 2898.96] See ya.
[2898.96 → 2900.08] He's also praying.
[2900.30 → 2900.92] He is praying.
[2901.06 → 2901.34] All right.
[2901.50 → 2901.82] Thanks.
[2905.32 → 2935.30] Thank you.
[2935.32 → 2956.90] Good morning.
[2956.90 → 2957.14] Good morning again.
[2958.34 → 2958.96] Good morning.
[2958.96 → 2959.02] Good morning.
[2960.12 → 2963.28] So as I mentioned already, we are in the church season of Advent.
[2964.20 → 2967.10] And Advent is a season.
[2967.76 → 2968.82] What kind of season is it?
[2969.34 → 2971.08] It's a season of waiting.
[2972.22 → 2973.98] It's a season of longing.
[2975.38 → 2983.14] Fleming Rutledge puts it in this kind of stark way where she says this, Advent begins in the dark.
[2984.38 → 2986.60] Advent begins in the dark.
[2986.60 → 2996.06] In other words, Advent takes seriously our experience that things in this life and in this world are not always the way they are meant to be.
[2996.88 → 3001.14] And that we need a Saviour to come to us.
[3001.14 → 3007.54] And that's why this Advent season we are looking at these ancient prayers called the Antiphons.
[3008.64 → 3017.88] Each of these prayers is a longing for the Messiah to come and to meet a particular need that we have.
[3018.46 → 3028.52] And then each of these prayers addresses Jesus using one of the titles and one of the prophecies from the book of Isaiah about the coming Messiah.
[3028.52 → 3031.62] So far, we've looked at two of these.
[3031.68 → 3032.80] And you can see them up here.
[3033.38 → 3038.84] We've looked at O Come Wisdom and O Lord Come.
[3039.62 → 3045.54] And so the first one, Come O Wisdom, it's looking to Jesus as the wisdom of God.
[3046.36 → 3050.62] Jesus comes to sweetly order our lives in this world.
[3050.62 → 3054.74] And then the second, last week, we looked at Come O Lord.
[3055.62 → 3061.60] As the Lord, Jesus is the God who appeared to Moses in the burning bush.
[3061.90 → 3064.54] He is the God who gave the law on Mount Sinai.
[3064.88 → 3068.32] And he comes to rule in justice and in righteousness.
[3069.42 → 3076.46] Now this week, we're going to look at the third antiphon, which addresses Jesus as the root of Jesse.
[3077.00 → 3078.20] Okay, the root of Jesse.
[3078.20 → 3083.54] And we find this image for Jesus, again, in Isaiah chapter 11.
[3083.66 → 3085.60] That's where we've been actually the last two weeks as well.
[3085.96 → 3087.08] Isaiah chapter 11.
[3087.36 → 3089.06] So I invite you to turn there with me.
[3089.56 → 3093.98] You can find that in page 517 if you're using your pew Bible.
[3094.12 → 3095.46] Page 517.
[3096.58 → 3099.04] We are in Isaiah chapter 11.
[3099.40 → 3101.72] And we're only going to be looking at two verses today.
[3101.72 → 3106.62] Isaiah chapter 11 verses 1 and verse 10.
[3107.04 → 3108.38] Verses 1 and verse 10.
[3108.64 → 3109.78] We'll also have it on the screen.
[3111.32 → 3112.82] So hear God's word.
[3114.12 → 3117.82] A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse.
[3118.56 → 3122.80] From his roots, a branch will bear fruit.
[3123.66 → 3125.06] And then jumping down to verse 10.
[3125.06 → 3129.80] In that day, the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples.
[3130.40 → 3132.48] The nations will rally to him.
[3133.04 → 3136.26] And his resting place will be glorious.
[3137.68 → 3139.08] This is the word of the Lord.
[3140.14 → 3140.98] Thanks be to God.
[3141.48 → 3145.70] And let's also read the antiphon for today.
[3146.24 → 3147.42] So here's the antiphon.
[3147.42 → 3153.74] Now you'll notice as we read them, actually these older prayers are the basis for the song, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
[3154.06 → 3156.92] But the song kind of rewords it, rewrites it.
[3157.46 → 3159.84] And we'll sing that after the sermon.
[3160.02 → 3163.18] But before, we'll say the prayer, which is just a little bit different.
[3163.64 → 3164.70] So let's say it together.
[3165.70 → 3174.18] O root of Jesse, standing as a sign among the peoples, before your kings will shut their mouths.
[3174.18 → 3182.00] To you, the nations will make their prayer, come and deliver us, and delay no longer.
[3182.64 → 3185.44] And let me pray for us as we come before God and his word.
[3186.58 → 3189.32] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[3190.30 → 3195.72] We thank you that your word is absolutely true and that you give it to us because you love us.
[3196.84 → 3202.92] O root of Jesse, eternal son of the Father, help us to be deeply rooted in you.
[3202.92 → 3206.18] And from you, to receive all that we need.
[3206.76 → 3210.84] To the glory of your holy name, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3212.14 → 3220.18] So this idea of Jesus as the root of Jesse, it comes again from Isaiah chapter 11.
[3220.38 → 3222.20] And the imagery has been picked up.
[3222.56 → 3228.14] Not just in the antiphons, not just in O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, the song.
[3228.14 → 3230.60] But in other places as well.
[3230.70 → 3235.58] Like, for example, the Christmas carol, Lo, How a Rose Are Blooming.
[3236.20 → 3236.42] Right?
[3236.48 → 3238.12] We sang it earlier this morning.
[3239.02 → 3240.64] I think we did pretty good.
[3241.60 → 3246.38] Because, especially, it's maybe one that's a little bit less familiar to us.
[3246.74 → 3249.62] It's one you typically skip when you go Carolina, right?
[3250.62 → 3252.30] It's in the carol books often.
[3252.70 → 3253.52] I don't know if you know that.
[3253.62 → 3255.82] But usually, you know, people will go Carolina.
[3255.90 → 3256.98] They'll get to that one.
[3257.16 → 3259.06] And it's like, anybody know this one?
[3259.96 → 3260.32] No?
[3260.50 → 3260.72] Okay.
[3261.18 → 3262.16] Hark the Herald again.
[3262.30 → 3262.48] Right?
[3262.52 → 3264.32] And then you just go on, and you sing Hark the Herald.
[3266.12 → 3270.42] And you probably notice when we sang it, it's a little bit of a difficult hymn.
[3270.42 → 3275.40] The timing is a little unusual for us average churchgoers today.
[3276.36 → 3282.30] The rhythm kind of seems to speed up, slow down, with various rests and holds.
[3282.34 → 3284.08] And it creates this dramatic effect.
[3284.64 → 3287.80] And it takes some getting used to, but it is a beautiful song.
[3288.70 → 3293.42] In the words of that carol, it tells a story using the imagery of Isaiah.
[3293.42 → 3300.34] Where the prophet tells that one day, a shoot will come forth from the stump of Jesse.
[3301.30 → 3305.84] So here is the first verse.
[3306.10 → 3311.78] Lo, how a rose ever blooming from tender stem hath sprung.
[3312.50 → 3316.46] Of Jesse's lineage coming as men of old have sung.
[3316.46 → 3321.84] And so this morning, I want us to think about that image.
[3322.02 → 3324.64] The image of Jesus as the root of Jesse.
[3325.40 → 3332.18] And hopefully in doing so, our hearts might be stirred to long for Jesus' coming at Christmas.
[3333.54 → 3341.52] And so as we get started this morning, the first thing I want us to think about is this idea, again, that Advent begins in the dark.
[3342.24 → 3342.40] Okay?
[3342.48 → 3343.60] Advent begins in the dark.
[3343.60 → 3351.44] Because before we have this hope and this promise in Isaiah chapter 11, we have Isaiah chapters 1 through 10.
[3352.10 → 3358.94] Which contain these vivid images of the chopping down and the burning of a vast forest.
[3359.56 → 3362.68] That's some of the imagery that's woven through those first 10 chapters.
[3363.38 → 3369.80] In chapter 5, Isaiah refers to God's people as a vineyard that produces bad fruit.
[3370.08 → 3372.82] And so is destroyed and trampled on.
[3373.60 → 3383.20] In chapter 6, he says that they will be laid waste like a Meredith or an oak whose stump remains after it is cut down.
[3384.48 → 3392.60] And then in chapter 7 through 10, he describes Assyria as like an axe that chops down the forest of God's people.
[3393.16 → 3395.06] So that only stumps remain.
[3395.06 → 3396.06] This forest of lofty trees.
[3396.06 → 3398.74] This forest of lofty trees.
[3398.74 → 3400.22] That was God's people Israel.
[3400.22 → 3405.60] Israel is meant to represent the arrogance of his people.
[3405.94 → 3411.28] And then the axe of God's judgment will come, and it will chop down the forest of human sin.
[3412.54 → 3417.14] As one writer puts it, the human race was an ecological disaster.
[3417.14 → 3421.34] And God flattens the forest with one swing of his axe.
[3421.34 → 3428.72] My family and I, before we moved out here to Vancouver area, we lived for about a year in Virginia.
[3429.04 → 3430.38] And I've shared some of this with you.
[3430.72 → 3434.28] And we lived on this property that was full of walnut trees.
[3434.76 → 3438.42] And it was a very, very old property from the 1700s.
[3438.78 → 3442.92] But it had these walnut trees that would just drop walnuts, these big nuts, all over the yard.
[3442.92 → 3448.32] And you could actually go, and we'd fill up barrels full of walnuts just to get them off the lawn.
[3449.18 → 3452.02] And there was one of these walnut trees right in the middle of the property.
[3452.66 → 3454.28] It was this beautiful big tree.
[3455.04 → 3459.72] And while we were there, even though this tree must have been there for, I don't know, hundreds of years.
[3460.64 → 3464.56] While we were there, a storm came through and it just destroyed the tree.
[3464.76 → 3467.78] The tree, it broke, branches were falling off, snapped in half.
[3468.02 → 3469.40] It was just lying all over the yard.
[3469.40 → 3474.84] And so the kids would play in the branches and walk along the fallen trunk.
[3475.62 → 3479.54] And then some tree cutters came and gave us some very nice firewood.
[3480.80 → 3487.40] But it was this vivid image for us, seeing this tall, majestic, beautiful tree full of life.
[3488.24 → 3493.14] And then seeing what was left after it was cut down, fallen down.
[3494.64 → 3496.88] You know, and I don't know if you've ever seen a ruined forest.
[3496.88 → 3507.78] Or, you know, with all of our forest fires that we have in BC, maybe you've driven, and you've seen just the devastation left by all these trees being burned or chopped down.
[3508.26 → 3510.84] Well, that's the image that Isaiah is giving us here.
[3511.44 → 3515.74] A lifeless, barren field of stumps.
[3516.40 → 3520.46] And it's an image of his judgment against his people.
[3520.46 → 3523.74] And that's why Advent begins in the dark.
[3524.76 → 3528.08] Advent comes before Christmas on purpose.
[3528.60 → 3531.68] Those two seasons, Advent and Christmas, they're not interchangeable.
[3532.00 → 3533.34] They're not meant to be the same.
[3534.18 → 3544.86] Before we get to Santa Claus and Charlie Brown and Christmas trees and, you know, decking the halls, chestnuts roasting before an open fire, all that.
[3544.86 → 3553.50] Before all that, the season of Advent is meant to remind us that we live in a world that is burdened by sin.
[3554.34 → 3556.92] That's more like a ruined forest.
[3558.64 → 3561.76] You know, and it's why most of the Advent songs are in a minor key.
[3562.16 → 3562.26] Right?
[3562.32 → 3563.04] Have you noticed that?
[3564.10 → 3565.82] O come, O come, Emmanuel.
[3567.12 → 3569.30] Ransom the captive Israel.
[3569.30 → 3569.64] Right?
[3569.72 → 3574.64] Come and set us free, in other words, from, you know, a world that's in slavery to sin and darkness.
[3576.02 → 3581.54] Come, thou long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[3582.14 → 3585.36] From our fears and sins, release us.
[3586.08 → 3587.50] Let us find our rest in thee.
[3588.78 → 3597.92] And so Advent is a chance for us to pause and to kind of stare into the darkness.
[3599.30 → 3601.64] The truth is, we don't like to do that.
[3601.72 → 3606.98] We don't like to stop and be honest about the darkness in our lives and in the world.
[3607.46 → 3609.44] I mean, most of the time we rush to put a bow on it.
[3610.30 → 3617.24] And I was just thinking, in fact, literally, we take a cut-down tree, and we put lights on it, don't we?
[3619.10 → 3621.88] And we do the same thing with our lives sometimes.
[3622.20 → 3627.66] We take the stumps of our lives, and we put a bow on it, and we try to decorate it and make it look nice.
[3627.66 → 3633.04] But Advent is an opportunity for us to be honest about the darkness.
[3633.92 → 3642.44] Because it's only when we really come to grips with the stumps, the wasteland of our hearts and of the world,
[3642.94 → 3649.12] that we will then long for a Messiah to come, a Saviour to come and to set things right.
[3649.12 → 3651.92] So Advent begins in the dark.
[3652.84 → 3659.76] But then Isaiah, he, after kind of sort of giving us this picture of this burned down, cut down wasteland of a forest,
[3660.26 → 3661.74] he sees something.
[3662.80 → 3666.34] It's small, and you have to look really hard.
[3667.22 → 3669.74] But Isaiah sees a small shoot of green.
[3670.56 → 3673.46] Maybe it's a rose, maybe another kind of flower.
[3673.46 → 3679.78] But one little branch sprouting up in this field of dead, lifeless place.
[3680.10 → 3682.38] And that's the image of Christmas hope.
[3683.62 → 3689.88] So Isaiah chapter 11 begins now in verse 1 with this image of hope.
[3690.04 → 3690.52] And it says,
[3690.52 → 3693.86] A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse.
[3694.54 → 3698.50] From his roots, a branch will bear fruit.
[3699.78 → 3701.66] Now, who is Jesse?
[3701.66 → 3705.52] Who is this Jesse that Isaiah is talking about?
[3708.10 → 3708.64] Right?
[3709.30 → 3710.00] Maybe you heard it.
[3710.08 → 3712.00] The father of David, right?
[3712.26 → 3713.04] King David.
[3713.14 → 3715.44] David was Jesse's youngest son.
[3716.16 → 3721.86] If you remember, this is the same David who killed Goliath, who wrote many of the hymns, the Psalms.
[3722.72 → 3726.02] And David's line was the lineage of the kings of Israel.
[3726.02 → 3732.26] And Isaiah is telling us the Messiah would come from that line, from the root of Jesse.
[3733.66 → 3741.90] In the background of Isaiah's picture is David's decision in 2 Samuel chapter 7 to build a temple to the Lord.
[3742.76 → 3742.98] Right?
[3743.04 → 3745.82] Up until that point, they had the Ark of the Covenant.
[3745.82 → 3748.74] And the Ark was moving all about.
[3749.78 → 3755.88] But once David was settled as the king over Israel, he wanted the Ark to have a permanent location.
[3756.32 → 3759.48] One place where the people would then be able to come and worship God.
[3760.28 → 3765.48] And he told this idea to Nathan, the prophet, who told him, go ahead and do it.
[3765.48 → 3768.64] But that night, God spoke to Nathan.
[3769.54 → 3773.66] And he said he did not want David to build him a house or a temple.
[3774.42 → 3778.00] Instead, God was going to build David a house.
[3778.92 → 3785.50] The Lord promised David that he would establish his line as kings over his people.
[3786.12 → 3788.30] And so we have 2 Samuel 7.16.
[3789.12 → 3793.14] Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me.
[3793.14 → 3796.06] Your throne will be established forever.
[3796.18 → 3797.46] That's the Davidic covenant.
[3798.50 → 3805.40] So God promised that David's descendants would always be kings of Israel over his people forever.
[3806.32 → 3814.20] But it turns out that King David, even for all of his flaws, he was the best king that Israel ever had.
[3815.18 → 3817.78] His reign was the golden age of Israel.
[3817.94 → 3819.82] Israel was at the height of their powers.
[3819.82 → 3825.48] And the decline started to happen almost immediately after David's reign.
[3826.22 → 3832.58] King Solomon rules for decades, but even Solomon's heart begins to drift away from the Lord.
[3833.58 → 3837.10] And then after Solomon, the kingdom was split in two.
[3837.28 → 3839.44] Israel in the north, Judah in the south.
[3839.90 → 3845.22] And only Judah remained under a Davidic rule.
[3845.22 → 3849.08] Now, we come to the prophet Isaiah.
[3849.58 → 3858.04] Isaiah writes hundreds of years later, during the reigns of kings Uzziah and Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah.
[3858.98 → 3862.96] And by their time, the decline is in full effect.
[3864.22 → 3864.36] Right?
[3864.50 → 3868.04] Hezekiah is one of the few bright spots among Judah's kings.
[3868.04 → 3872.14] But then his son, Manasseh, is among the worst kings of Israel.
[3873.16 → 3878.24] Manasseh even offered his own child as a sacrifice to the Canaanite gods.
[3879.40 → 3885.70] And their rejection of the Lord led to the eventual destruction of Jerusalem and the exile.
[3886.70 → 3886.82] Right?
[3886.92 → 3888.64] Jerusalem is burned to the ground.
[3889.24 → 3892.38] The temple built by David's son Solomon is destroyed.
[3892.38 → 3903.58] And the Davidic king at that time, Jeconiah, something like that, he is taken in chains to Babylon.
[3904.64 → 3906.98] And this is the cutting down of the tree.
[3908.48 → 3910.88] And the story doesn't really improve much from here.
[3912.88 → 3914.92] Jeconiah, he dies in Babylon.
[3914.92 → 3918.58] He has a grandson named Zerubbabel.
[3919.26 → 3922.58] And he leads a group of people back home from Babylon.
[3923.04 → 3927.30] And he serves as the governor under the ruling Persian Empire.
[3928.12 → 3932.16] And the next 500 years after that are actually just brutally difficult.
[3933.24 → 3942.40] And by the time we get now to Mary and Joseph, the beginning of the New Testament, Judah is fully under the control of the Roman Empire.
[3942.40 → 3948.54] So David's once great line is reduced to a shadow of its former glory.
[3948.82 → 3954.34] The line of kings is reduced to a poor carpenter, Joseph.
[3956.36 → 3959.68] But God had given Isaiah a vision of hope.
[3960.34 → 3960.52] Right?
[3960.60 → 3962.72] That David's line would hold.
[3963.70 → 3966.04] The nation hadn't had a king.
[3966.10 → 3969.12] It hadn't had a Davidic king since the exile.
[3969.12 → 3973.96] But one day, one of David's descendants would sit on the throne.
[3974.98 → 3978.58] A shoot will come up from that stump of Jesse.
[3979.34 → 3982.64] From his roots, a branch will bear fruit.
[3984.20 → 3988.88] And so even though at that time, Judah, the world itself, it looks like a wasteland.
[3989.68 → 3992.18] Isaiah says there is still a reason to hope.
[3992.88 → 3996.44] God promised that he would always have a man to sit on the throne as king.
[3996.44 → 4002.24] And then all through those next thousand years of tumultuous history, God, what did he do?
[4002.78 → 4006.42] He protected, and he preserved that line.
[4007.90 → 4010.96] Jesus is the descendant of King David.
[4011.60 → 4013.34] He is the shoot from the stump of Jesse.
[4014.38 → 4019.94] That's why Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem for the census.
[4020.46 → 4020.60] Right?
[4020.60 → 4027.28] Many of us are so familiar with this Christmas story, with the story of Jesus' birth, you know, that we find in like Luke chapter 2.
[4027.82 → 4030.86] But listen to this detail in Luke chapter 2.
[4032.76 → 4035.76] Everyone went to their own town to register.
[4036.70 → 4045.04] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of whom?
[4045.04 → 4045.68] David.
[4045.68 → 4046.60] David.
[4047.12 → 4053.14] Because he belonged to the house and the line of David.
[4055.40 → 4060.22] Jesus is the rightful heir of David, Jesse's son.
[4060.96 → 4066.90] He is the answer to God's promise that a true and better David would come to reign forever.
[4066.90 → 4075.18] He would be a king who would rule with understanding and insight, with justice and righteousness, anointed by the Holy Spirit.
[4076.54 → 4083.76] And so from the time of the exile to the time of Jesus' birth, this period of like 500 years, God's people were waiting.
[4083.86 → 4092.12] They were waiting for this promised Messiah, this root that would burst forth into this flower that would bloom in the desert, in the wilderness.
[4093.16 → 4096.18] They waited to see if the promises would come true.
[4096.90 → 4105.36] And then in the city of David was born a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, great David's greater son.
[4106.98 → 4109.20] And what does it mean that the Messiah comes?
[4109.34 → 4112.12] Isaiah says it will be a sign to the nations.
[4113.10 → 4114.48] That's what we see in verse 10.
[4115.72 → 4117.48] So verse 10, once again, it says this.
[4118.22 → 4122.08] In that day, the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples.
[4122.08 → 4127.38] The nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.
[4128.52 → 4135.74] Isaiah says that as the root of Jesse, Jesus will be a banner for the peoples.
[4136.46 → 4139.30] The coming of David's descendant is like a sign.
[4139.42 → 4140.06] It's a banner.
[4140.40 → 4141.68] It's a flag that's waving.
[4142.22 → 4149.02] A sign to not only Israel, but to all the nations that the true king has come.
[4149.02 → 4150.24] Jesus is born.
[4150.60 → 4152.18] The promise has arrived.
[4153.10 → 4155.80] And he wasn't going to be just a king for little Judah.
[4156.36 → 4159.14] He was going to be the king of all people.
[4160.04 → 4164.52] And with his coming, it was a call to the nations, a banner that was raised.
[4164.82 → 4165.90] The king is here.
[4166.64 → 4168.96] Give your allegiance to him.
[4168.96 → 4173.68] And so who comes to worship the newborn king in Bethlehem?
[4175.36 → 4178.24] Shepherds who were tending the flock.
[4178.90 → 4179.66] And who else?
[4180.90 → 4182.58] Wise men from the east.
[4183.90 → 4184.06] Right?
[4184.22 → 4184.76] Gentiles.
[4185.42 → 4186.88] People from the other nations.
[4187.68 → 4189.64] They had come to worship him.
[4189.70 → 4191.72] They've heard of this promise, this prophecy.
[4191.72 → 4195.30] And they saw his star rising in the east.
[4195.76 → 4197.10] And they followed it.
[4197.28 → 4199.94] And they came to this little baby.
[4200.62 → 4203.90] And they acknowledged him as the true king.
[4204.32 → 4205.78] And they worshipped him.
[4205.94 → 4208.78] And they brought him gifts fitting for a king.
[4209.32 → 4210.86] He was the banner.
[4211.06 → 4213.98] The sign to the nations that the true king has come.
[4213.98 → 4218.34] Jesus is the shoot from the stump of Jesse.
[4218.72 → 4223.04] He is the long-awaited king who has come to save us from sin and death.
[4223.78 → 4230.48] And one day, the whole earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[4231.22 → 4232.50] As it says in verse 9.
[4235.52 → 4240.76] So as we close, let me give us just one question to ponder.
[4240.76 → 4247.60] One question to ask ourselves to meditate on as we think about Jesus as the root of Jesse.
[4249.10 → 4251.06] And the question is simply this.
[4252.16 → 4254.70] Are you connected to the branch?
[4256.34 → 4260.08] Are you connected to this root of Jesse?
[4261.00 → 4262.06] Are you connected to him?
[4263.26 → 4267.66] In the Gospel of John, John chapter 15 that we read earlier, Jesus says this.
[4267.66 → 4270.74] He says, I am the vine.
[4272.26 → 4273.98] You are the branches.
[4274.78 → 4279.14] If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[4279.56 → 4282.56] Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[4285.12 → 4285.60] Right?
[4285.70 → 4289.26] So Jesus Christ, he is the shoot from the stump of Jesse.
[4289.62 → 4292.18] He is the Messiah who has come from David's line.
[4292.18 → 4299.50] In the wasteland of the chopped down forest of our world, God is making something grow.
[4300.62 → 4300.86] Right?
[4300.92 → 4303.86] And that growth, it only comes through Jesus Christ.
[4304.82 → 4306.38] So are you connected to him?
[4307.80 → 4310.08] When you see all this wasteland, there's no life there.
[4310.14 → 4313.22] But there is this branch that is sprouting up.
[4313.30 → 4314.36] There is life there.
[4314.36 → 4318.38] And the call is to find our life in that branch.
[4318.46 → 4320.72] To be grafted into that branch.
[4320.80 → 4322.14] To draw our life from him.
[4323.94 → 4330.00] The Anglican priest and poet, Malcolm Gîte, he wrote a series of sonnets based on these Antiphons.
[4330.68 → 4332.36] And I encourage you to Google them.
[4333.20 → 4334.04] You can find his website.
[4334.18 → 4335.68] You can read them all or buy his book.
[4335.68 → 4342.86] But I want to share just a few lines from this sonnet that is based on this image of Jesus as the root of Jesse.
[4343.36 → 4345.22] So this is what he says toward the end.
[4347.06 → 4351.46] Now we have need of you, forgotten root.
[4352.32 → 4355.20] The stalk and stem of every living thing.
[4355.82 → 4358.60] Whom once we worshipped in the sacred grove.
[4359.18 → 4360.28] For now is winter.
[4360.82 → 4361.90] Now is withering.
[4361.90 → 4365.88] Unless we let you root us deep within.
[4366.54 → 4367.92] Under the ground of being.
[4368.74 → 4369.42] Graft us in.
[4371.82 → 4375.70] So have you been grafted into Jesus?
[4376.70 → 4380.10] Are you connected to him as the source of your life?
[4381.26 → 4382.68] Have you given your life to Jesus?
[4383.58 → 4386.90] Jesus, he welcomes you to find your life in him.
[4387.26 → 4389.84] He welcomes you to be connected to him as the branch.
[4390.22 → 4391.74] By putting your faith in him.
[4392.48 → 4393.78] So let me pray for us.
[4396.76 → 4401.84] Father, you promised to your servant David that you would provide a king to sit on the throne.
[4403.04 → 4404.64] And Father, you kept that promise.
[4404.74 → 4405.02] Hallelujah.
[4405.02 → 4405.22] Hallelujah.
[4406.22 → 4407.66] In the coming of Jesus.
[4408.42 → 4409.84] The descendant of David.
[4409.98 → 4410.88] The root of Jesse.
[4411.44 → 4414.22] The shoot that springs up from the stump.
[4415.68 → 4418.78] And the coming of Jesus is a signal to come.
[4419.52 → 4420.90] It's a signal to be welcomed.
[4420.90 → 4423.86] To find that, Lord, you are God.
[4423.94 → 4425.42] That you are gracious and merciful.
[4425.90 → 4426.64] Slow to anger.
[4426.84 → 4429.28] Abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
[4429.96 → 4432.08] Forgiving in transgression and iniquity.
[4432.08 → 4435.46] So, Lord, we come to you.
[4435.46 → 4439.10] We come to you not in our own pride and arrogance.
[4439.88 → 4441.84] Not in the things that we have done.
[4442.60 → 4444.76] Not in the ways that we have lived this life.
[4444.76 → 4447.08] But, Lord, only confessing our need for you.
[4447.50 → 4449.36] Confessing that there is no life in us.
[4450.54 → 4452.16] But that in you is life.
[4452.98 → 4455.72] So we ask, Lord, that you would give us faith.
[4455.72 → 4456.32] A gift.
[4457.22 → 4459.02] The faith to trust in Jesus.
[4460.10 → 4463.38] And that you would welcome us as your children.
[4463.52 → 4464.26] Holy and beloved.
[4464.82 → 4466.30] Because of the work of our Saviour.
[4467.76 → 4468.78] Graft us in, Lord.
[4469.40 → 4470.92] That we would have life in you.
[4471.74 → 4473.08] And do these things we ask.
[4473.28 → 4474.22] In the name of Jesus.
[4475.02 → 4476.04] And for his sake.
[4476.52 → 4476.86] Amen.
[4478.86 → 4480.06] Alright, let's all stand.
[4480.36 → 4482.76] And as we've been doing and will continue to do.
[4482.76 → 4486.34] We will sing, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
[4486.94 → 4489.08] Singing first about wisdom.
[4489.68 → 4490.46] And the Lord.
[4491.08 → 4492.04] And the root of Jesse.
[4513.60 → 4515.86] With the land.
[4522.00 → 4522.46] And the root of Jesse.
[4524.00 → 4526.46] Moving on.
[4526.46 → 4556.44] . . .
[4556.46 → 4586.44] . . .
[4586.46 → 4616.44] . . .
[4616.46 → 4618.46] . . . .
[4646.46 → 4648.46] . . .
[4648.46 → 4650.46] . . .
[4650.46 → 4652.46] . . .
[4652.46 → 4656.46] . . .
[4656.46 → 4658.46] . . .
[4658.46 → 4660.46] . . .
[4660.46 → 4662.46] . . .
[4662.46 → 4664.46] . . .
[4664.46 → 4666.46] . . .
[4666.46 → 4668.46] . . .
[4668.46 → 4670.46] . . .
[4670.46 → 4676.46] . . .
[4676.46 → 4678.46] . . .
[4678.46 → 4680.46] . .
[4680.46 → 4682.46] . . .
[4682.46 → 4684.46] . . .
[4684.46 → 4697.46] Christ, with our heavenly land, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[4697.46 → 4717.10] O come, O come, O come, O Lord of night, who to thy tribes thou sign us white.
[4717.10 → 4733.10] In ancient times did give the law, in power, majesty, and all.
[4733.10 → 4749.74] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[4749.74 → 4768.84] O come, O come, O which after us is set, and to let them rescue them.
[4768.84 → 4776.50] From death shall have a miracle save
[4776.50 → 4784.02] And give the victory over the grave
[4784.02 → 4793.60] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[4793.60 → 4801.92] Shall come to thee, O Israel
[4801.92 → 4809.02] You may receive it.
[4815.42 → 4819.64] So we now will come to the time when we give our tithes and offerings
[4819.64 → 4824.26] And the response to God's grace to us, His coming to us as Saviour
[4824.26 → 4826.62] The response is always one of gratitude
[4826.62 → 4829.66] And one of the ways, of course, that we express that
[4829.66 → 4835.36] That gratitude for the gift of God's only Son, Jesus Christ, our Saviour
[4835.36 → 4838.54] And all that He gives us is actually just partly
[4838.54 → 4843.82] It's to contribute to His work of ministry in the world
[4843.82 → 4850.18] And so may I invite the deacons to come and collect our morning offering
[4850.18 → 4856.18] Our designated offering for today is local church ministries
[4856.18 → 4856.90] Okay
[4886.18 → 4893.92] To be collectivist, Romans, for the rest of the giving
[4893.92 → 4899.28] And all that of their ф duty
[4899.28 → 4903.64] And all that I pray
[4903.64 → 4905.10] They be collectivist....
[4905.36 → 4906.94] Attention to your men
[4906.94 → 4908.34] See you invest and women
[4908.34 → 4910.86] Give the victory
[4910.86 → 4913.42] Candy
[4913.42 → 4915.42] Amen.
[4943.42 → 4945.42] Amen.
[4973.42 → 4975.42] Amen.
[5003.42 → 5010.42] Amen.
[5010.42 → 5012.42] Amen.
[5012.42 → 5014.42] Amen.
[5014.42 → 5016.42] Amen.
[5016.42 → 5018.42] Amen.
[5018.42 → 5020.42] Amen.
[5020.42 → 5024.42] Amen.
[5024.42 → 5028.42] Amen.
[5028.42 → 5029.42] Amen.
[5029.42 → 5030.42] Thank you, Paul and Joshua.
[5030.42 → 5032.42] It's great to have Joshua with us on the cello.
[5032.42 → 5035.42] So we'll go to the Lord in prayer.
[5035.42 → 5042.42] One of the things that we'll pray for and that we announced last week was the death of our sister, Allie Hack lander.
[5042.42 → 5048.42] And her funeral, her memorial service will be this Tuesday here at the church at 11 a.m.
[5048.42 → 5050.42] So Tuesday at 11 a.m.
[5050.42 → 5055.42] So let's go before the Lord in prayer and bring our needs to him.
[5055.42 → 5064.42] Heavenly Father, we praise you because you are the God who sees us.
[5064.42 → 5068.42] You are the God who knows our needs.
[5068.42 → 5075.42] And you are the God who hears our prayers and answers them and comes to us.
[5075.42 → 5087.42] Lord, would you humble us, remind us of all the places of desperate need that we have in our lives and in this world and to acknowledge them before you.
[5087.42 → 5092.42] And remind us that you are the God of life.
[5092.42 → 5095.42] You are the God who fills those needs.
[5095.42 → 5101.42] Lord, we pray especially today for those who do not yet know you.
[5101.42 → 5108.42] Who don't yet know you as that living vine, the source of all life and goodness.
[5108.42 → 5116.42] Lord, we thank you for the opportunities that you give us to welcome and to invite people into our church community.
[5116.42 → 5119.42] So that they might come to know you.
[5119.42 → 5128.42] God, would you give us generous hearts and give us generous lives towards our neighbours around us.
[5128.42 → 5143.42] Lord, we pray also that as we do that, as we encourage, step out and interact with our neighbours and share the love of Christ with them, that hearts would be open to hear the word of God.
[5143.42 → 5146.42] The hearts would be open as we pray for people.
[5146.42 → 5156.42] Lord, that we would have the opportunity to talk about the hope that is in us through Christ, especially in these weeks leading up to Christmas.
[5156.42 → 5164.42] And Lord, we pray that you would be drawing people throughout Delta to yourself.
[5164.42 → 5170.42] That you would give us eyes and ears to see the needs of our neighbours, to see their lives.
[5170.42 → 5176.42] And Lord, give us boldness, gentleness, and respect as we move towards them.
[5176.42 → 5178.42] Lord, be with us in this work.
[5178.42 → 5182.42] Because all authority in heaven and on earth is in your hands.
[5182.42 → 5188.42] And you promise to be with us as we take risks to move into the lives of people around us.
[5188.42 → 5191.42] Lord, so strengthen us and empower us by your spirit.
[5191.42 → 5199.42] Lord, we continue to grieve because of the death of our dear sister, Allie.
[5199.42 → 5203.42] Lord, she used to sit here amongst us each Sunday as we worship.
[5203.42 → 5207.42] And Lord, she is no longer here with us.
[5207.42 → 5210.42] But Lord, we do not grieve as those without hope.
[5210.42 → 5216.42] Because we know that she was grafted in to the life of our Lord Jesus.
[5216.42 → 5222.42] And that she will not be like the grass that withers forever, Lord.
[5222.42 → 5227.42] But that she will have life eternal that will never fade away.
[5227.42 → 5236.42] Lord, we pray that you would comfort all of us, her family, especially, Lord, who grieve and who miss her.
[5236.42 → 5244.42] Lord, we pray for the many people in our congregation who are hurting in some deep ways.
[5244.42 → 5248.42] Whether it's due to physical ailments or diseases.
[5248.42 → 5255.42] And Lord, we pray also for those who are suffering from broken or strained relationships.
[5255.42 → 5262.42] Lord Jesus, you are the great physician and you are the great reconciler.
[5262.42 → 5274.42] Lord, we ask that you would bring the hope and healing that only the gospel brings into our bodies and into our relationships, into our lives.
[5274.42 → 5285.42] And Heavenly Father, grant our prayers for the sake of Jesus Christ, our only mediator and advocate, who taught us to pray, saying together the words of the Lord's Prayer.
[5285.42 → 5289.42] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[5289.42 → 5295.42] Your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.
[5295.42 → 5298.42] Give us today our daily bread.
[5298.42 → 5302.42] And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[5302.42 → 5307.42] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[5307.42 → 5312.42] For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory now and forever.
[5312.42 → 5313.42] Amen.
[5313.42 → 5316.42] Let's rise.
[5318.42 → 5322.42] And go out with God's good word, his benediction upon us.
[5322.42 → 5328.42] Join us for a time of fellowship and refreshments in the fellowship hall, right through the doors there.
[5328.42 → 5332.42] And we do still have our choir rehearsal.
[5332.42 → 5335.42] And I think the children will be coming back also to rehearse.
[5335.42 → 5340.42] So with that, I invite you to hold out your hands to receive God's blessing.
[5340.42 → 5344.42] The peace of God, which passes all understanding.
[5344.42 → 5350.42] Keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God and of his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[5350.42 → 5358.42] And the blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always.
[5358.42 → 5359.42] Amen.
[5359.42 → 5360.42] Amen.
[5360.42 → 5361.42] Amen.
[5361.42 → 5362.42] Amen.
[5362.42 → 5363.42] Amen.
[5363.42 → 5364.42] Amen.
[5364.42 → 5365.42] Amen.
[5365.42 → 5368.42] Amen.
[5368.42 → 5369.42] Amen.
[5369.42 → 5387.42] Praise God from the Lord, all blessings flow.
[5387.42 → 5394.42] Praise to all creatures here below.
[5394.42 → 5403.42] Praise Him, our heart, He heavenly host.
[5403.42 → 5412.42] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[5412.42 → 5420.42] Praise God for His love, love, and peace.
[5420.42 → 5429.42] Praise God for gifts of joy and love.
[5429.42 → 5437.42] Praise God for sin, in Christ to dwell.
[5437.42 → 5447.42] Praise God for us, Emmanuel.
