[315.78 → 325.78] Good Friday is the day that commemorates the most holy passion of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[325.78 → 329.78] There is no benediction pronounced until Easter.
[329.78 → 333.78] This is a solemn Tenebrae service.
[333.78 → 341.78] The word Tenebrae is Latin for darkness, recalling the apparent triumph of darkness on Good Friday.
[341.78 → 349.78] And the Gospel writers reference to the increasing darkness that covered the earth as Jesus hung on the cross.
[349.78 → 357.78] We have placed eight candles on the table here to signify the eight stations of the cross.
[357.78 → 363.78] Those series of events that took place on the day of Jesus's crucifixion.
[363.78 → 373.78] And just as during Advent we lit an additional candle each Sunday to symbolize Jesus, the true light of the world coming into our world.
[373.78 → 384.78] Well, today, after each scripture reading, one of the eight candles will be extinguished to symbolize the sacrificial death of Jesus for our sins.
[384.78 → 392.78] The light returned with Jesus's resurrection on Easter morning.
[392.78 → 398.78] During our worship service today, the hymns will be over on the screen.
[398.78 → 402.78] The scripture readings, though, will only be printed in your order of worship.
[402.78 → 406.78] There will also be a few prayers in there, so please do follow along.
[406.78 → 413.78] So now, would you join me in a call to prayer printed in your order of worship on the first page.
[413.78 → 427.78] Christ, our Passover, was offered for us on this day.
[427.78 → 430.78] He was delivered for our offences.
[430.78 → 435.78] He bore our sins in his body on the cross.
[435.78 → 440.78] And the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[440.78 → 447.78] His soul was sorrowful, even unto death.
[447.78 → 452.78] He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter.
[452.78 → 459.78] He humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on the cross.
[459.78 → 464.78] Now we come to the Lord in a time of confession.
[464.78 → 466.78] So please bow your heads and pray with me.
[466.78 → 477.78] Holy God, creator of all things, your essence is love and goodness.
[477.78 → 482.78] You made us in your image.
[482.78 → 486.78] You made us for union with you in that love and goodness.
[486.78 → 492.78] But we have chosen to walk in darkness rather than in light.
[492.78 → 497.78] We have sinned against you and done what is evil in your sight.
[497.78 → 502.78] We have loved things that are unworthy of you.
[502.78 → 505.78] We have sought goodness outside of you.
[505.78 → 509.78] We have not believed your love is trustworthy.
[509.78 → 514.78] We have not believed your goodness is the way for our life.
[514.78 → 521.78] So we are each and all guilty before you.
[521.78 → 529.78] Please in your mercy, hear us now as we silently name those things for which we need your mercy and forgiveness.
[529.78 → 557.78] Please follow in your order of worship and read with me the assurance of pardon.
[557.78 → 561.78] What can wash away our sins?
[561.78 → 564.78] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[564.78 → 568.78] Children of God, he was pierced for our transgressions.
[568.78 → 571.78] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[571.78 → 575.78] The punishment that brought us peace was on him.
[575.78 → 578.78] And by his wounds we are healed.
[578.78 → 583.78] Let's stand and let's sing the song when I survey the wondrous cross.
[583.78 → 584.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[584.78 → 585.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[585.78 → 590.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[590.78 → 600.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[600.78 → 605.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[605.78 → 612.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross.
[612.78 → 623.78] Let's sing the wondrous cross for which the Prince of glory died.
[623.78 → 643.62] My riches gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride.
[643.62 → 664.82] Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ my God.
[664.82 → 684.82] All the great things that charm me most, I sacrifice them through His blood.
[684.82 → 697.18] See from His head, His hands, His feet.
[698.18 → 706.82] Sorrow and love flowing low down.
[706.82 → 717.86] Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
[718.80 → 727.82] O Lord, if Lord's compost so rich a crown.
[727.82 → 740.96] Were thou, O realm of nature mine,
[740.96 → 751.20] That were a present far too small.
[751.94 → 759.96] Love so amazing, so divine.
[759.96 → 771.96] Deep that my soul, my light, my all.
[778.96 → 780.60] Please be seated.
[781.80 → 787.42] And let us now go in our hearts and our imaginations to that first Good Friday
[787.42 → 789.16] and hear mysteries.
[789.96 → 807.76] Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor,
[808.22 → 810.16] and the governor asked him,
[810.60 → 812.48] Are you the king of the Jews?
[813.80 → 816.74] You have said so, Jesus replied.
[816.74 → 821.22] When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders,
[821.60 → 822.84] He gave no answer.
[824.26 → 826.00] Then Pilate asked him,
[826.76 → 830.44] Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?
[831.92 → 834.06] But Jesus made no reply,
[834.48 → 836.80] not even to a single charge,
[837.30 → 840.24] to the great amazement of the governor.
[840.24 → 846.18] When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere,
[846.18 → 849.16] But that instead an uproar was starting,
[850.10 → 854.24] He took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd.
[854.24 → 858.14] I am innocent of this man's blood,
[858.14 → 859.14] He said.
[859.62 → 861.58] It is your responsibility.
[863.46 → 866.74] But he had Jesus flogged
[866.74 → 870.92] And handed him over to be crucified.
[870.92 → 884.10] There anotherividual on one rich earthly mats.
[884.74 → 889.10] And the arrangement of the Israelites were found on his 재 quizzed,
[889.18 → 892.66] and he tried out too to give respect for this women's position in front of the revolt.
[892.66 → 914.00] Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorian and gathered the whole company
[914.00 → 915.66] of soldiers around him.
[915.66 → 922.56] They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and then twisted together a crown of
[922.56 → 925.84] thorns and set it on his head.
[925.84 → 929.08] They put a staff in his right hand.
[929.08 → 932.30] Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him.
[932.30 → 935.82] Hail, King of the Jews, they said.
[935.82 → 944.04] They spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
[944.04 → 950.26] After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him.
[950.26 → 953.28] Then they led him away to crucify him.
[974.04 → 996.32] Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day,
[996.32 → 1003.32] Christ on the road to Calvary.
[1003.32 → 1013.32] Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten men,
[1013.32 → 1020.32] He was a man, he was a man, he was a man, he was a man, he was a man.
[1020.32 → 1028.32] It is the power of the cross.
[1028.32 → 1037.32] Christ became sin for us.
[1037.32 → 1051.32] Took the blame, bore the wrath, we stand forgiven at the cross.
[1051.32 → 1062.32] Oh, to see the pain written on your face,
[1062.32 → 1070.32] Bearing the awesome great of sin.
[1070.32 → 1078.32] Every bitter thought, every evil deed,
[1078.32 → 1085.32] Growing your blood-stained crown,
[1085.32 → 1093.32] Is the power of the cross.
[1093.32 → 1100.32] Christ became sin for us.
[1100.32 → 1102.32] Christ became sin for us.
[1102.32 → 1116.32] Took the blame, o'er the wrath, we stand forgiven at the cross.
[1116.32 → 1126.32] Oh, to see my name written in the wounds,
[1126.32 → 1135.32] For through your suffering I am free.
[1135.32 → 1143.32] Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live.
[1143.32 → 1150.32] One through your selfless love.
[1150.32 → 1158.32] Is the power of the cross.
[1158.32 → 1166.32] Son of God, swing for us.
[1166.32 → 1173.32] What a love, what a cross.
[1173.32 → 1181.32] We stand forgiven at the cross.
[1196.32 → 1206.32] Carrying his own cross, he went out of the place of the skull,
[1206.32 → 1210.32] Which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.
[1210.32 → 1213.32] Please join me in response of prayer.
[1213.32 → 1219.32] Lord Jesus, we confess that our hearts are not steadfast.
[1219.32 → 1222.32] For through your grace, we pray.
[1222.32 → 1225.32] Draw near to us in your kindness,
[1225.32 → 1231.32] And save us from the cruelty, pride, and selfish ambitions
[1231.32 → 1234.32] That separate us from you.

[1260.32 → 1261.32] Like that.
[1261.32 → 1263.32] I think he Rice celebrates over your hands
[1263.32 → 1274.78] A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus,
[1274.78 → 1280.04] was passing by on his way from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
[1282.02 → 1285.84] Please follow along with the prayer in the order of worship.
[1287.90 → 1292.70] Lord Jesus, you have involved men and women in the carrying of your cross.
[1292.70 → 1295.54] You have invited us to share your sufferings.
[1296.46 → 1302.74] Lord, we desire to take up our crossers, and all of you have served us.
[1304.32 → 1309.00] Help us to carry them with joy and with hope, because you are walking with us,
[1309.12 → 1311.86] because you have triumphed over suffering for us.
[1312.66 → 1313.22] Amen.

[1412.80 → 1424.80] T'was I, Lord Jesus, I was denied you.

[1488.06 → 1496.88] Therefore, dear Jesus
[1496.88 → 1503.04] Since I cannot pay you
[1503.04 → 1509.04] I do adore you
[1509.04 → 1515.04] And will ever pray you

[1555.46 → 1558.58] Including women who mourned and wailed for him
[1558.58 → 1561.30] Jesus turned and said to them
[1561.30 → 1563.32] Daughters of Jerusalem
[1563.32 → 1565.14] Do not weep for me
[1565.14 → 1566.58] Weep for yourselves
[1566.58 → 1567.82] And for your children
[1567.82 → 1570.58] For the time will come
[1570.58 → 1571.54] When you will say
[1571.54 → 1573.98] Blessed are the childless women
[1573.98 → 1576.22] The wombs that never bore
[1576.22 → 1578.58] And the breasts that never nursed
[1579.58 → 1581.72] Then they will say to the mountains
[1581.72 → 1583.22] Fall on us
[1583.22 → 1584.60] And to the hills
[1584.60 → 1585.74] Cover us
[1585.74 → 1587.94] For if people do these things
[1587.94 → 1589.14] When the tree is green
[1589.14 → 1591.42] What will happen when it is dry
[1591.42 → 1617.54] Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh
[1617.54 → 1619.12] But he did not take it
[1619.12 → 1620.90] And they crucified him
[1620.90 → 1622.86] Dividing up his clothes
[1622.86 → 1623.82] They cast lots
[1623.82 → 1625.28] To see what each would get
[1625.28 → 1627.32] It was nine in the morning
[1627.32 → 1628.60] When they crucified him
[1628.60 → 1631.80] The written notice of the charge against him read
[1631.80 → 1633.38] The king of the Jews
[1633.38 → 1636.20] They crucified two rebels with him
[1636.20 → 1637.50] One on his right
[1637.50 → 1638.96] And one on his left
[1638.96 → 1640.88] Those who passed by
[1640.88 → 1642.36] Hurled insults at him
[1642.36 → 1643.60] Shaking their heads
[1643.60 → 1644.22] And saying
[1644.22 → 1647.86] So you who are going to destroy the temple
[1647.86 → 1649.40] And build it in three days
[1649.40 → 1651.20] Come down from the cross
[1651.20 → 1652.22] And save yourself
[1652.22 → 1654.06] In the same way
[1654.06 → 1655.22] The chief priests
[1655.22 → 1656.94] And the teachers of the law
[1656.94 → 1659.16] Mocked him amongst themselves
[1659.16 → 1660.50] He saved others
[1660.50 → 1661.14] They said
[1661.14 → 1663.00] But he can't save himself
[1663.00 → 1665.20] Let this Messiah
[1665.20 → 1666.72] This king of Israel
[1666.72 → 1668.66] Come down now from the cross
[1668.66 → 1671.42] That we may see and believe
[1671.42 → 1673.84] Those crucified with him also
[1673.84 → 1675.24] Heaped insults on him
[1675.24 → 1688.28] Let's rise with the men's heart
[1688.28 → 1711.34] What wondrous love is this
[1711.34 → 1713.28] O my soul
[1713.28 → 1715.42] O my soul
[1715.42 → 1720.18] What wondrous love is this
[1720.18 → 1723.12] O my soul
[1723.12 → 1728.42] What wondrous love is this
[1728.42 → 1732.86] That caused the Lord of bliss
[1732.86 → 1737.60] To bear the dreadful curse
[1737.60 → 1740.10] For my soul
[1740.10 → 1742.32] For my soul
[1742.32 → 1747.08] To bear the dreadful curse
[1747.08 → 1750.02] For my soul
[1750.02 → 1756.94] To God and to the Lamb
[1756.94 → 1759.32] I will sing
[1759.32 → 1761.32] I will sing
[1761.32 → 1765.98] To God and to the Lamb
[1765.98 → 1768.32] I will sing
[1768.32 → 1774.36] To God and to the Lamb
[1774.36 → 1778.92] Who is the great I am
[1778.92 → 1783.80] While millions join the theme
[1783.80 → 1786.32] I will sing
[1786.32 → 1788.54] I will sing
[1788.54 → 1793.42] While millions join the theme
[1793.42 → 1795.12] I will sing
[1795.12 → 1796.12] I will sing
[1796.12 → 1797.62] I will sing
[1797.62 → 1803.12] And when from death I'm free
[1803.12 → 1806.14] I'll sing on
[1806.14 → 1808.20] I'll sing on
[1808.20 → 1812.60] And when from death I'm free
[1812.60 → 1816.18] I'll sing on
[1816.18 → 1823.88] I'll sing
[1823.88 → 1825.88] I'll sing
[1825.88 → 1829.88] And through eternity
[1829.88 → 1833.74] I'll sing on
[1833.74 → 1836.22] I'll sing on
[1836.22 → 1840.22] And through eternity
[1840.22 → 1841.92] I'll sing on
[1841.92 → 1843.92] I'll sing on
[1843.92 → 1845.92] I'll sing on
[1845.92 → 1847.92] I'll sing on
[1847.92 → 1875.00] Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother
[1875.00 → 1876.70] His mother's sister
[1876.70 → 1879.02] Mary the wife of Colours
[1879.02 → 1880.70] And Mary Magdalene
[1880.70 → 1883.18] When Jesus saw his mother there
[1883.18 → 1884.52] And the disciple
[1884.52 → 1887.20] Whom he loved standing nearby
[1887.20 → 1888.76] He said to her
[1888.76 → 1889.40] Woman
[1889.40 → 1891.10] Here is your son
[1891.10 → 1892.38] And to disciple
[1892.38 → 1894.08] Here is your mother
[1894.08 → 1896.26] From that time on

[1928.82 → 1945.30] At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
[1945.86 → 1952.22] And at three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[1953.12 → 1956.82] Eloy, Eloy, lemma sabachthani,
[1956.82 → 1963.76] which means, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[1967.50 → 1978.56] St. John, in his gospel, wants to introduce Jesus Christ to a world that has not heard about him much yet.
[1979.78 → 1982.96] And in the opening paragraph, he writes this,
[1982.96 → 1990.66] In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
[1991.44 → 1997.90] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[1997.90 → 2010.20] What we contemplate together today is the event in all human history when the darkness most appeared victorious.
[2010.20 → 2018.42] And you know there have been many, lots of horrible, dark moments in the history of our world.
[2020.38 → 2024.42] On Good Friday, the darkness appeared victorious.
[2025.54 → 2033.86] If you had been there, you would have thought that the light of the world was snuffed out, just like these candles.
[2033.86 → 2037.10] But what is this light?
[2037.10 → 2039.92] And what is this darkness?
[2040.60 → 2044.14] That are struggling together against each other.
[2045.54 → 2050.64] Well, the darkness is everything that is set against the life of God.
[2051.66 → 2055.58] Everything that doubts the creator's goodness and love.
[2056.54 → 2062.04] Everything that disbelieves his will is the way to happiness and fulfillment.
[2062.04 → 2068.70] Everything that is disloyal to his good and beautiful laws for his people.
[2069.96 → 2078.72] The darkness is summed up in the three things that we often renounce in our times of confession, both corporately and personally.
[2080.06 → 2086.64] There are sinful desires within our hearts, grasping for things that God does not want us to have.
[2086.64 → 2098.20] And the darkness permeates human society with powers that corrupt and destroy God's good creation and devalue people made in his image.
[2098.20 → 2104.00] And the struggle is also cosmic and not all visible.
[2104.96 → 2110.76] There is Satan and spiritual forces of evil that refuse to recognize God's reign.
[2111.88 → 2112.90] That's the darkness.
[2113.68 → 2116.44] The world, the flesh, and the devil.
[2116.44 → 2127.54] And the darkness was pleased at the brutal, unmerciful, and unjust death of Jesus Christ on the cross.
[2129.00 → 2133.44] Finally, that troubling voice seemed stilled.
[2133.44 → 2139.28] That voice that was called into being all things that have been made.
[2140.28 → 2147.26] That voice that said, follow me and fill these jars with water.
[2149.00 → 2155.84] The voice that told a confused Pharisee that God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[2157.26 → 2162.78] And the voice that said at last, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[2162.78 → 2162.88] Why have you forsaken me?
[2165.42 → 2168.34] The light had been snuffed out.
[2169.64 → 2172.44] Darkness came over the whole land.
[2174.32 → 2181.32] If that is the darkness, what is this light of all mankind that came and shined into the darkness?
[2182.50 → 2190.76] He is the radiance of God, the exact representation of the God that you cannot see and survive.
[2190.76 → 2195.96] He is the love of God for his creation.
[2197.32 → 2202.08] He is the eternal word made flesh to dwell among us.
[2202.74 → 2206.90] This second person of the blessed Trinity, the only-begotten God.
[2206.90 → 2212.76] Begotten from the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light.
[2213.44 → 2218.56] Who for us and our salvation became the Son of Mary.
[2219.90 → 2222.72] Jesus Christ is as divine as his Father.
[2223.74 → 2227.88] And he is as human as any person in this room.
[2227.88 → 2235.46] The light of the world was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.
[2236.42 → 2239.04] He suffered and was buried.
[2240.58 → 2246.24] Sadly, it is our own darkness that nailed him to that terrible tree.
[2246.24 → 2251.24] No one took his life away from him.
[2252.20 → 2254.96] He offered it up voluntarily.
[2256.56 → 2263.28] Because today is the day of the real Passover that all the other Passovers pointed to.
[2264.54 → 2269.38] Today is the day that the wounds were inflicted by which we are healed.
[2269.38 → 2274.32] Today is the day that the real lamb is slain.
[2275.08 → 2278.86] To which all the other sacrifices in the temple were pictures.
[2280.66 → 2284.06] And today, let us remember that on that first Good Friday,
[2284.34 → 2289.32] at that moment when Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last,
[2289.98 → 2295.20] it really appeared that the darkness had beaten the light.
[2295.20 → 2298.50] It most certainly meant to.
[2299.60 → 2300.70] And it tried to.
[2310.70 → 2316.40] Let's sing a song here, Beneath the Cross.
[2316.40 → 2346.38] Let's sing a song here, Beneath the Cross.
[2346.40 → 2357.60] Beneath the Cross of Jesus, I find a place to stand,
[2357.60 → 2368.36] And wonder at such mercy that calls me as I am.
[2368.36 → 2374.28] For lands that should discard me,
[2374.84 → 2379.78] Old moons which tell me come,
[2379.78 → 2385.74] Beneath the Cross of Jesus,
[2385.74 → 2391.40] My unworthy soul is one.
[2391.40 → 2404.60] Beneath the Cross of Jesus, His family is my own.
[2404.60 → 2410.52] Once strangers chasing selfless dreams,
[2410.52 → 2415.72] Now one through grace alone.
[2415.72 → 2426.72] How could I now disarm the words that you have known?
[2426.72 → 2432.72] Beneath the Cross of Jesus,
[2432.72 → 2438.72] See the children called by God.
[2438.72 → 2445.72] Beneath the Cross of Jesus,
[2445.72 → 2446.72] Beneath the Cross of Jesus,
[2446.72 → 2451.72] The path before the ground.
[2451.72 → 2457.72] We follow in His footsteps,
[2457.72 → 2463.72] Where promised hope is found.
[2463.72 → 2469.78] How brave the joy be for us,
[2469.78 → 2474.72] To be His perfect bride.
[2474.72 → 2481.72] He leads the cross of Jesus,
[2481.72 → 2487.72] We will gladly live our lives.
[2487.72 → 2510.72] Friends, this is the table of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2510.72 → 2515.72] Gained for us through His service of love.
[2515.72 → 2520.72] Here at this table we see the truth about Jesus,
[2520.72 → 2523.72] And about ourselves.
[2523.72 → 2528.72] Here we taste mercy for sinners.
[2528.72 → 2533.72] And here we find nourishment for the life of love that He has called us to.
[2533.72 → 2540.72] This table then is for those who call Jesus Lord and Saviour.
[2540.72 → 2544.72] It is for those who acknowledge their sin.
[2544.72 → 2550.72] And it is for those who look to Jesus' death for their forgiveness.
[2550.72 → 2557.72] And it is for all those who have made these things public through baptism into the Christian church.
[2557.72 → 2560.72] If this is not your faith,
[2560.72 → 2564.72] We are grateful that you are joining us today.
[2564.72 → 2569.72] We would just ask that you not partake of this meal at this time.
[2569.72 → 2572.72] But for all of us,
[2572.72 → 2576.72] This table is a time for us to look to Jesus,
[2576.72 → 2579.72] Especially His death on the cross,
[2579.72 → 2583.72] And together to worship Him.
[2583.72 → 2588.72] Hear now these words from our Lord Jesus,
[2588.72 → 2593.72] In the Gospel of Mark.
[2593.72 → 2595.72] While they were eating,
[2595.72 → 2597.72] Jesus took bread,
[2597.72 → 2600.72] And when He had given thanks, He broke it.
[2600.72 → 2603.72] And He gave it to His disciples,
[2603.72 → 2604.72] Saying, Take it.
[2604.72 → 2606.72] This is my body.
[2606.72 → 2609.72] Then He took a cup,
[2609.72 → 2611.72] And when He had given thanks,
[2611.72 → 2612.72] He gave it to them,
[2612.72 → 2613.72] And He drank from it,
[2613.72 → 2614.72] Saying,
[2614.72 → 2617.72] This is the blood of the covenant,
[2617.72 → 2619.72] Which is poured out for many.
[2619.72 → 2621.72] He said to them,
[2621.72 → 2622.72] Truly I tell you,
[2622.72 → 2626.72] I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine,
[2626.72 → 2628.72] Until that day,
[2628.72 → 2631.72] When I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
[2633.72 → 2636.72] May I ask the servers to come forward,
[2636.72 → 2640.72] And we will distribute the bread and the wine.
[2666.72 → 2668.72] He is BLACK oak nookiyzähled!
[2668.72 → 2669.72] For you!
[2669.72 → 2683.72] concert
[2683.72 → 2688.38] with pupil as
[2688.38 → 2698.76] O sacred head now wounded
[2698.76 → 2705.76] With grief and shame weighed down
[2705.76 → 2712.68] Now scornfully surrounded
[2712.68 → 2719.94] With arms your only crown
[2719.94 → 2727.78] O sacred head what glory
[2727.78 → 2734.64] And blessings you have known
[2734.64 → 2741.92] Yet though despised and glory
[2741.92 → 2749.74] I claim you as my own
[2749.74 → 2759.56] Amen
[2759.56 → 2769.38] Amen
[2770.20 → 2795.20] Amen
[2795.20 → 2796.20] Amen.
[2825.20 → 2840.32] Our Lord Jesus said, take it.
[2841.04 → 2842.30] This is my body.
[2855.20 → 2857.20] Amen.
[2885.20 → 2886.20] Amen.
[2915.20 → 2937.20] To thank you, dearest friend, for this your dying sorrow, your mercy without end.
[2937.20 → 2951.34] Lord, make me yours forever, a loyal servant true.
[2951.34 → 2966.96] And let me never, never outlive my love for you.
[2967.20 → 2968.00] Amen.

[3013.54 → 3015.54] Amen.
[3043.54 → 3045.54] Amen.
[3054.36 → 3056.32] Our Lord Jesus Christ said,
[3056.44 → 3058.18] This is my blood of the new covenant,
[3059.12 → 3061.60] which is poured out for many.
[3062.24 → 3062.78] Let's drink.
[3069.04 → 3070.44] May you please pray with me.
[3070.44 → 3076.42] Father, we give you great thanks and praise
[3076.42 → 3078.38] that we can build our hope
[3078.38 → 3082.80] on the solid foundation of Christ the Lord.
[3083.72 → 3085.18] Christ who came,
[3086.14 → 3087.04] who lived,
[3088.00 → 3089.38] who suffered and died,
[3090.30 → 3093.68] and who rose again triumphant over the darkness.
[3094.90 → 3097.46] We thank you, Lord, for this simple
[3097.46 → 3100.22] but very costly meal.
[3101.38 → 3104.34] And we pray, Lord, that you would indeed use it
[3104.34 → 3107.46] to cause us to put our hope in you,
[3108.18 → 3111.34] to always remember your love for us
[3111.34 → 3113.76] so that we might love you
[3113.76 → 3115.86] and walk in your ways.
[3116.46 → 3119.42] We pray through Jesus Christ,
[3120.26 → 3120.94] our Lord.

[3122.10 → 3122.12] Amen.
[3122.12 → 3122.14] Amen.
[3130.44 → 3153.32] With a loud cry,
[3154.32 → 3156.36] Jesus breathed his last.
[3156.36 → 3160.46] The curtain of the temple was torn in two
[3160.46 → 3161.48] from top to bottom.
[3162.90 → 3164.18] And when the centurion,
[3164.48 → 3166.98] who stood there in front of Jesus,
[3167.80 → 3169.34] saw how he died,
[3170.32 → 3170.94] he said,
[3171.46 → 3173.46] Surely this man
[3173.46 → 3175.86] was the Son of God.
[3175.86 → 3175.92] Amen.
