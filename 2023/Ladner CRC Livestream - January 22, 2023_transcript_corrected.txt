[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[122.00 → 124.00] Amen.
[124.00 → 126.00] Amen.
[126.00 → 128.00] Amen.
[128.00 → 130.00] Amen.
[130.00 → 132.00] Amen.
[132.00 → 134.00] Amen.
[134.00 → 136.00] Amen.
[136.00 → 138.00] Amen.
[138.00 → 140.00] Amen.
[140.00 → 142.00] Good morning.
[142.00 → 147.00] My name is Ryan, and I'd like to welcome you this morning to Ladder Christian Reformed Church this Sunday.
[147.00 → 153.00] It is a joyous occasion to gather and worship our Lord Jesus, our God and our Redeemer.
[153.00 → 159.00] If you are new here or visiting, I'd like to extend a special welcome and an invitation to join us after the service.
[159.00 → 163.00] Community is important to us, and we'd love to get to know you.
[163.00 → 167.00] This morning we'll be taking coffee in the foyer rather than the fellowship hall,
[167.00 → 171.00] as our Chinese friends will be celebrating Lunar New Year in the hall itself.
[171.00 → 179.00] And I've got one quick reminder that is for the Bible reading bookmarks that Jason has provided for us.
[179.00 → 183.00] Just a couple of verses every single day that we can read together as a congregation
[183.00 → 187.00] and just build the discipleship of Bible reading every day.
[187.00 → 193.00] So, yeah, just grab one in the foyer if you haven't got one already and just stick to it.
[193.00 → 198.00] This morning, Pastor Jason will be continuing his series on the Beatitudes,
[198.00 → 202.00] and this morning we'll be focusing on a hunger for righteousness.
[202.00 → 206.00] So let us now turn our hearts and minds to the worship of our Creator.
[206.00 → 212.00] Please stand if you're able and join in a responsive call to worship from Isaiah 32.
[212.00 → 220.00] See, a king will reign in righteousness, and rulers will rule with justice.
[220.00 → 224.00] Each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm,
[224.00 → 229.00] like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
[229.00 → 238.00] Lord, justice, the wealth in the desert, his righteousness lived in the fertile field.
[238.00 → 241.00] The fruit of that righteousness will be peace.
[241.00 → 246.00] Its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.
[246.00 → 248.00] Let us pray.
[248.00 → 254.00] Everlasting God, from our innermost being, we praise your holy name.
[254.00 → 260.00] We behold the wonder of your mighty works, the icy mountains, the oceans and rivers teeming with life,
[260.00 → 265.00] the rising and the setting of the sun, the vastness of space.
[265.00 → 267.00] And we are awestruck.
[267.00 → 271.00] This world is unfathomably, almost infinitely complex,
[271.00 → 276.00] and yet each of us is so precious to you that every hair on our head is accounted for.
[276.00 → 281.00] Indeed, your love for us is boundless, inescapable, and internal.
[281.00 → 287.00] Lord, we pray this morning that our imperfect worship of you is made perfect through the blood of your son, Jesus.
[287.00 → 292.00] To the glory and your honour be praised. Amen.
[292.00 → 296.00] God greets us this morning through Paul's words from Ephesians.
[296.00 → 299.00] Praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[299.00 → 303.00] who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[303.00 → 310.00] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[310.00 → 316.00] In love he predestined on us for adoption of kingship through Jesus Christ,
[316.00 → 318.00] in according to his pleasure and will.
[318.00 → 324.00] To the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the one he loves.
[324.00 → 327.00] Let us take a moment to say good morning to our few neighbours,
[327.00 → 331.00] before we join together in singing God's praise.
[331.00 → 348.00] Thank you.
[361.00 → 390.98] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
[391.00 → 404.00] early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.
[404.00 → 417.36] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
[417.36 → 428.84] God in free persons, blessed Trinity.
[431.34 → 441.48] Holy, holy, holy, all the saints are holy,
[441.48 → 451.48] casting down their golden crumbs around the glassy sea.
[451.48 → 462.86] Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
[462.86 → 472.86] which word cannot tell, evermore shall be.
[473.40 → 477.86] Holy, holy, holy, holy,
[477.86 → 482.86] though the darkness hide thee,
[482.86 → 492.86] though the eyes of sinful when thy glory may not see.
[492.86 → 503.74] Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee,
[504.28 → 511.86] perfect empowering love and purity.
[511.86 → 529.86] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
[529.86 → 539.86] all thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[540.86 → 549.86] Holy, holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
[549.86 → 559.86] God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[559.86 → 560.86] Hast.
[560.86 → 564.96] Sh DANI OFF
[564.96 → 569.86] Chapter 56
[569.86 → 570.86] Amen.
[599.86 → 606.38] The power of His grace, the beauty of His peace.
[606.90 → 614.80] Remember how His mercy reached, and we cried out to Him.
[615.34 → 623.22] He lifted us to solemn ground to freedom from our sin.
[623.22 → 636.82] Oh, save my soul and tell His God till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[640.00 → 647.22] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[647.22 → 655.22] His power in us is greater than this world.
[656.38 → 663.22] To share the reason for our hope, to serve with love and grace.
[664.66 → 671.22] And all who see Him shine through us, why bring the Father's praise?
[671.22 → 680.62] Oh, save my soul and tell all He's done.
[680.88 → 685.22] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[688.22 → 691.22] Oh, save my soul.
[691.22 → 700.68] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[701.10 → 708.62] No other name on earth can sit and raise the soul to life.
[709.10 → 716.22] He opens up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown.
[716.22 → 724.46] We labour in His fields of grace as He the sinners call.
[724.46 → 732.82] Oh, save my soul and tell all He's done.
[732.82 → 737.96] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[737.96 → 747.96] Oh, save my soul and tell all He's done.
[747.96 → 754.12] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[754.12 → 777.94] We are a moment.
[777.94 → 780.94] You are forever.
[780.94 → 784.94] Lord of the ages.
[784.94 → 788.94] God before time.
[788.94 → 792.08] We are a vapour.
[792.08 → 795.54] You are eternal.
[795.54 → 798.94] Love everlasting.
[798.94 → 803.94] Raining on life.
[803.94 → 810.94] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[810.94 → 817.94] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[817.94 → 830.94] Highest praises, Father, and glory be unto your name.
[830.94 → 837.94] Be unto your name.
[837.94 → 841.94] We are the broken.
[841.94 → 845.94] You are the healer.
[845.94 → 849.94] Jesus, healer.
[849.94 → 852.94] Mighty to stay.
[852.94 → 853.94] You are the love stone.
[853.94 → 856.94] You are the love stone.
[856.94 → 859.94] We'll sing forever.
[859.94 → 863.94] Bowing before you.
[863.94 → 868.94] Blessing your name.
[868.94 → 874.94] Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[874.94 → 881.94] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[881.94 → 895.94] Highest praises, honour, and glory be unto your name.
[895.94 → 896.94] Be unto your name.
[896.94 → 897.94] Be unto your name.
[897.94 → 902.94] Be unto your name.
[902.94 → 907.94] Lord of the Holy Lord,
[907.94 → 911.94] Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[911.94 → 915.94] We are the Lord, and glory be unto your name.
[915.94 → 918.12] was laid
[918.12 → 920.36] Highest
[920.36 → 921.68] praises
[921.68 → 924.68] honour and glory
[924.68 → 927.36] Be unto
[927.36 → 930.68] your name
[930.68 → 934.12] Be unto
[934.12 → 936.68] your name
[945.94 → 952.04] Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked
[952.04 → 955.88] Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?
[956.68 → 958.40] Why do you ask me about what is good?
[958.60 → 959.32] Jesus replied
[959.32 → 960.90] There is only one who is good
[960.90 → 963.70] If you want to enter your life, keep the commandments
[963.70 → 965.94] Which ones? The man inquired
[965.94 → 967.20] Jesus replied
[967.20 → 968.48] You shall not murder
[968.48 → 970.40] You shall not commit adultery
[970.40 → 971.86] You shall not steal
[971.86 → 974.24] You shall not give false testimony
[974.24 → 976.26] Honour your father and mother
[976.26 → 978.50] And love your neighbour as yourself
[978.50 → 980.96] All these I have kept
[980.96 → 982.46] The young man said
[982.46 → 984.02] What do I still lack?
[985.42 → 986.16] Jesus answered
[986.16 → 987.58] If you want to be perfect
[987.58 → 989.34] Go sell your possessions
[989.34 → 991.04] And give it all to the poor
[991.04 → 993.34] And you will have treasure in heaven
[993.34 → 994.98] Then come
[994.98 → 996.30] Follow me
[996.30 → 998.60] When the young man heard this
[998.60 → 999.88] He went away sad
[999.88 → 1002.02] Because he had great wealth
[1002.02 → 1004.80] Let us come before our God
[1004.80 → 1006.02] And confess our sins
[1006.02 → 1006.64] Through prayer
[1006.64 → 1009.02] Merciful
[1009.02 → 1010.42] Righteous God
[1010.42 → 1012.56] We stand here before you
[1012.56 → 1013.64] A sinful
[1013.64 → 1015.18] Wayward people
[1015.18 → 1016.52] As Christians
[1016.52 → 1018.22] We have traded in heavenly righteousness
[1018.22 → 1020.20] For self-righteousness
[1020.20 → 1021.98] The needs of the suffering
[1021.98 → 1022.72] The poor
[1022.72 → 1023.82] And the downtrodden
[1023.82 → 1024.66] Are quickly
[1024.66 → 1026.46] Almost imperceptibly
[1026.46 → 1027.46] Brushed aside
[1027.46 → 1029.08] In their place
[1029.08 → 1030.28] We occupy our time
[1030.28 → 1031.56] With petty squabbling
[1031.56 → 1032.68] Over secular convictions
[1032.68 → 1034.26] A hunger for power
[1034.26 → 1036.20] Chasing worldly success
[1036.20 → 1037.82] Or perhaps worst of all
[1037.82 → 1039.02] With apathetic hearts
[1039.02 → 1040.20] Your kingdom work
[1040.20 → 1040.88] Is traded in
[1040.88 → 1041.82] For doing nothing
[1041.82 → 1042.66] In particular
[1042.66 → 1043.26] At all
[1043.26 → 1045.46] Perhaps the weight of the world
[1045.46 → 1046.58] Is just too heavy a burden
[1046.58 → 1048.84] Perhaps we have given in to despair
[1048.84 → 1051.08] Rather than bringing it to the cross
[1051.08 → 1053.02] We have let our weakness
[1053.02 → 1054.12] Bury us
[1054.12 → 1056.80] You offer to take away our sins
[1056.80 → 1057.76] And we say
[1057.76 → 1058.90] Yes Lord
[1058.90 → 1060.20] But not yet
[1060.20 → 1062.24] We confess then
[1062.24 → 1063.84] That we have not fed the hungry
[1063.84 → 1065.06] Or quenched the thirsty
[1065.06 → 1066.20] Or clothed the naked
[1066.20 → 1067.98] We have not visited the sick
[1067.98 → 1068.84] Or the imprisoned
[1068.84 → 1070.58] Help us Lord
[1070.58 → 1071.56] To do better
[1071.56 → 1073.26] As Moses prayed
[1073.26 → 1074.26] Teach us
[1074.26 → 1075.40] To number our days
[1075.40 → 1076.92] So we may turn our hearts
[1076.92 → 1077.86] Unto wisdom
[1077.86 → 1079.70] Mend our brokenness
[1079.70 → 1081.44] And fill us with your Holy Spirit
[1081.44 → 1083.40] So we can take up your kingdom work
[1083.40 → 1084.66] With an eager hand
[1084.66 → 1085.74] And a pure heart
[1085.74 → 1088.08] Without Christ's sacrifice for us
[1088.08 → 1089.80] We know none of this is possible
[1089.80 → 1091.20] But through his blood
[1091.20 → 1092.26] We cannot fail
[1092.26 → 1094.18] And therefore it is in his name
[1094.18 → 1095.22] And his name alone
[1095.22 → 1096.04] That we pray
[1096.04 → 1097.12] Amen
[1097.12 → 1100.22] Jesus said to his disciples
[1100.22 → 1101.50] Truly I tell you
[1101.50 → 1103.06] It is hard for someone who is rich
[1103.06 → 1104.62] To enter the kingdom of heaven
[1104.62 → 1105.94] Again I tell you
[1105.94 → 1107.22] It is easier for a camel
[1107.22 → 1108.88] To go through the eye of a needle
[1108.88 → 1110.54] Than for someone who is rich
[1110.54 → 1111.98] To enter the kingdom of God
[1111.98 → 1113.92] When the disciples heard this
[1113.92 → 1115.72] They were greatly astonished
[1115.72 → 1116.40] And asked
[1116.40 → 1117.48] Who then
[1117.48 → 1119.00] Can be saved
[1119.00 → 1120.42] Jesus looked at them
[1120.42 → 1120.78] And said
[1120.78 → 1121.58] With man
[1121.58 → 1122.86] This is impossible
[1122.86 → 1124.22] But with God
[1124.22 → 1126.42] All things are possible
[1126.42 → 1128.72] Our sins
[1128.72 → 1129.28] They are many
[1129.28 → 1130.42] But his mercy
[1130.42 → 1131.42] Is more
[1131.42 → 1132.66] Let us sing
[1132.66 → 1137.00] What a love could remember
[1137.00 → 1152.34] No wrongs we have done
[1152.34 → 1153.34] Amen.
[1182.34 → 1192.34] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1192.34 → 1222.32] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1222.34 → 1228.92] He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor.
[1230.18 → 1236.34] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1236.98 → 1244.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1244.88 → 1250.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1250.88 → 1258.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1258.88 → 1259.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1259.88 → 1261.88] Amen.
[1261.88 → 1271.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1271.88 → 1274.68] His life was the cause.
[1274.68 → 1280.88] We stood with the debt we could never afford.
[1280.88 → 1286.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1286.88 → 1296.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1296.88 → 1298.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1298.88 → 1300.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1300.88 → 1302.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1302.88 → 1304.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1304.88 → 1308.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1308.88 → 1312.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1312.88 → 1316.88] Stronger than darkness, new every morn.
[1316.88 → 1322.88] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.
[1322.88 → 1338.88] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1338.88 → 1342.88] So the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes,
[1342.88 → 1359.88] this time ages three through grade five.
[1359.88 → 1363.88] And so we are in a study of the Beatitudes.
[1363.88 → 1368.88] And this is the beginning section of the Sermon on the Mount.
[1368.88 → 1372.88] And we are considering as we study the Beatitudes,
[1372.88 → 1376.88] what it means to be and to become a disciple of Jesus.
[1376.88 → 1381.88] What does it mean to be and to become a disciple of Jesus?
[1381.88 → 1386.88] And so this morning, we come to the fourth Beatitude
[1386.88 → 1391.88] about being empty and yet being filled.
[1391.88 → 1397.88] About hungering and thirsting and yet being satisfied.
[1397.88 → 1402.88] And so with that in mind, let's turn our attention to God's word
[1402.88 → 1404.88] and read the Beatitudes again.
[1404.88 → 1410.88] And today, I've gotten Ryan to help me out.
[1410.88 → 1415.88] So what we're going to do is we are going to read,
[1415.88 → 1418.88] we're going to have, we're going to split the congregation in half,
[1418.88 → 1419.88] all of you here.
[1419.88 → 1422.88] And so half of you will read one verse,
[1422.88 → 1426.88] and then the other half will respond with the next verse.
[1426.88 → 1432.88] Okay, so you all, you know, if you're kind of, you know where you are.
[1432.88 → 1433.88] So you can choose.
[1433.88 → 1435.88] If you're kind of in the middle, this side, that side.
[1435.88 → 1438.88] So we'll begin with this side of the congregation,
[1438.88 → 1440.88] and Ryan will be leading you all.
[1440.88 → 1443.88] And then with the yellow, this side, you follow me,
[1443.88 → 1445.88] and we will read the next verse.
[1445.88 → 1446.88] Okay?
[1446.88 → 1449.88] So let's, let's hear the word of the Lord and say it together.
[1449.88 → 1455.88] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1455.88 → 1460.88] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[1460.88 → 1465.88] Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[1465.88 → 1470.88] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[1470.88 → 1472.88] for they will be filled.
[1472.88 → 1477.88] Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
[1477.88 → 1483.88] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
[1483.88 → 1489.88] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
[1489.88 → 1494.88] Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
[1494.88 → 1498.88] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1498.88 → 1500.88] This is the word of the Lord.
[1500.88 → 1501.88] Thanks be to God.
[1501.88 → 1502.88] Thank you, Ryan.
[1502.88 → 1505.88] Would you please join me in prayer?
[1505.88 → 1514.88] Heavenly Father, once again, we are so grateful that you worked through Matthew, the tax collector,
[1514.88 → 1517.88] to write down these words of Jesus.
[1517.88 → 1533.88] And would you now work among us today to help us understand these words, and not only to understand them, but to be changed by them, so that Christ's glory is reflected in our lives.
[1533.88 → 1537.88] For this we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[1537.88 → 1550.88] So as I've mentioned before, I love Calvin and Hobbes, and often as I'm preparing sermons, there's so many that are relevant that I could go to, and I usually try to not use it all the time.
[1550.88 → 1552.88] But really, I thought I would today.
[1552.88 → 1556.88] You know, who knows Calvin and Hobbes?
[1556.88 → 1558.88] Okay, many of you do. This is great.
[1558.88 → 1570.88] Now, if you read Calvin and Hobbes, you might know that Calvin's favourite breakfast cereal is called Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs.
[1570.88 → 1574.88] From John. Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs.
[1574.88 → 1589.88] So one day, Calvin notices on his box of chocolate frosted sugar bombs that, you know, the cereal company has a promotion where you can order an official chocolate frosted sugar bombs beanie, a hat.
[1589.88 → 1592.88] And it has a propeller on top.
[1592.88 → 1597.88] You just have to send in four proof of purchase seals to get it.
[1597.88 → 1603.88] And so Calvin decides he really wants this propeller beanie, that this would be so awesome.
[1603.88 → 1607.88] Yeah, hold on. It's okay.
[1607.88 → 1616.88] And so he goes to the task of eating four boxes of cereal, and he tries to enlist his dad to help him, who refuses.
[1616.88 → 1622.88] But eventually, he finally eats the four boxes of cereal, and he gets his mom to help him place the order.
[1622.88 → 1626.88] And she tells him, well, it's going to take six weeks for it to arrive in the mail.
[1626.88 → 1633.88] And of course, if you are a six-year-old boy, six weeks feel like forever.
[1633.88 → 1638.88] So he waits, and he waits, and he waits.
[1638.88 → 1643.88] And while he waits, he thinks about this propeller beanie all the time.
[1643.88 → 1647.88] He daydreams about it in school.
[1647.88 → 1652.88] And he imagines what it's going to be like to fly through the air.
[1652.88 → 1660.88] And every day after school, he runs home, and he asks his mom if it's come yet.
[1660.88 → 1662.88] And it's an agonizing wait.
[1662.88 → 1667.88] But then finally, the day arrives, the propeller beanie comes in the mail.
[1667.88 → 1676.88] So Calvin, he opens the box, he assembles the propeller, he puts in the battery, and then here is the final comic strip.
[1676.88 → 1682.88] Is it going to work?
[1682.88 → 1684.88] Okay, there it is.
[1684.88 → 1688.88] So I'm not sure how well you can see it, but I'll read it to you.
[1688.88 → 1690.88] I'm not flying.
[1690.88 → 1692.88] This beanie doesn't make me fly.
[1692.88 → 1696.88] What's the point of a propeller beanie if you can't even fly when you wear it?
[1696.88 → 1699.88] Not style, certainly, says Hobbs.
[1699.88 → 1701.88] What a rip-off.
[1701.88 → 1708.88] I ate all that cereal, waited weeks and weeks to get the beanie, assembled it myself, and the dumb thing doesn't even fly.
[1708.88 → 1710.88] At least it's not a total loss.
[1710.88 → 1712.88] It came in this great cardboard box.
[1712.88 → 1715.88] Oh boy, now we can really have some fun.
[1715.88 → 1720.88] And I'm sharing this with you because I think this is something we can all relate to.
[1720.88 → 1727.88] Like Calvin, we all have things that we long for.
[1727.88 → 1734.88] For Calvin, as a six-year-old boy, his longing was for a beanie that could make you fly.
[1734.88 → 1740.88] So I wonder for you, what do you long for?
[1740.88 → 1746.88] Do you feel a sense of longing in your own life?
[1746.88 → 1762.88] Maybe you long for healing in your body or reconciliation in your family or for a close friendship or an amazing experience in life or for meaningful work or something to do.
[1762.88 → 1766.88] There are many good things that we long for.
[1766.88 → 1768.88] These are all good things.
[1768.88 → 1777.88] But often what happens is that in our hearts and our imaginations, we think that these things are going to satisfy our deepest longings.
[1777.88 → 1788.88] But like Calvin, even when we get what we desire, it doesn't live up to everything that we were longing for.
[1788.88 → 1799.88] And we are often left feeling empty, unsatisfied, longing for something that we can't quite get.
[1799.88 → 1811.88] In whatever form our longings may take, I think that Jesus wants us to connect with this basic human experience.
[1811.88 → 1816.88] Because that longing that we all have is a clue.
[1816.88 → 1827.88] It is a clue to something greater that there is a deeper kind of hunger that Jesus says only he can satisfy.
[1827.88 → 1833.88] And I love the way C.S. Lewis puts it in his book, Mere Christianity.
[1833.88 → 1836.88] This may be a familiar quote, but let me share it with you.
[1836.88 → 1838.88] This is what he says.
[1838.88 → 1845.88] Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists.
[1845.88 → 1847.88] Let me say that again.
[1847.88 → 1859.88] Creatures, God's creation, us included, are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists.
[1859.88 → 1860.88] A baby feels hunger.
[1860.88 → 1862.88] Well, there's such a thing as food.
[1862.88 → 1864.88] A duckling wants to swim.
[1864.88 → 1867.88] Well, there is such a thing as water.
[1867.88 → 1881.88] If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.
[1881.88 → 1894.88] Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.
[1894.88 → 1899.88] And that is exactly what Jesus is saying to us this morning in this fourth beatitude.
[1899.88 → 1911.88] In verse six, Jesus says, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[1911.88 → 1915.88] And he is saying that there is a truer desire.
[1915.88 → 1922.88] There is a deeper longing that we all have that only he can satisfy.
[1922.88 → 1926.88] So let's look at this fourth beatitude this morning in two simple ways.
[1926.88 → 1933.88] First, just blessed are the poor, sorry, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, and then for they will be filled.
[1933.88 → 1936.88] So we'll just kind of break it up into those two parts.
[1936.88 → 1942.88] So first, Jesus says, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[1942.88 → 1952.88] So in this beatitude, when Jesus talks about hunger and thirst, he is appealing to some of the most basic needs that we have as human beings.
[1952.88 → 1954.88] Hunger and thirst.
[1954.88 → 1961.88] You probably already thought or said those words or heard those words this morning in your house.
[1961.88 → 1965.88] I am hungry, or I am thirsty, or you're feeling it.
[1965.88 → 1967.88] I need to eat, or I need to drink something.
[1967.88 → 1977.88] And until those basic appetites, those basic needs are cared for, until they're attended to, everything else has to wait.
[1977.88 → 1984.88] When Christie and I were studying Chinese, one of the first phrases we learned was this greeting.
[1984.88 → 1986.88] Ni Chiu BAO la ma?
[1986.88 → 1989.88] And it means, have you eaten?
[1989.88 → 1991.88] And I thought, well, so this is a greeting.
[1991.88 → 1992.88] You meet someone.
[1992.88 → 1993.88] Have you eaten?
[1993.88 → 1995.88] It's kind of weird.
[1995.88 → 1998.88] But really, when you think about it, it makes so much sense.
[1998.88 → 1999.88] It's really smart.
[1999.88 → 2003.88] Because you can't do anything until you've eaten.
[2003.88 → 2004.88] Right?
[2004.88 → 2009.88] You might want to do something like read a book or take a walk or even just make it through your workday.
[2009.88 → 2016.88] But if you are starving, it's like everything else has to be put on hold.
[2016.88 → 2020.88] We push everything else aside, and we attend to that basic need.
[2020.88 → 2032.88] So Jesus is saying, if you hunger and if you are hungry and thirsty within, and if you have this thought, I cannot live without God in my life.
[2032.88 → 2037.88] Jesus says, congratulations.
[2037.88 → 2043.88] And remember that word blessed that Jesus uses here is a congratulatory formula.
[2043.88 → 2046.88] It's like a biblical high five.
[2046.88 → 2047.88] Right?
[2047.88 → 2053.88] And when Jesus calls us blessed, it means that we are beginning to live in harmony with the kingdom of God.
[2053.88 → 2060.88] But you know, it's almost shocking how Jesus says what he says here.
[2060.88 → 2065.88] Notice he doesn't say, blessed are the righteous.
[2065.88 → 2067.88] That's what we might expect him to say.
[2067.88 → 2068.88] Blessed are the righteous.
[2068.88 → 2076.88] But you know, he says, blessed are you if you hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[2076.88 → 2082.88] In other words, the dealbreaker for Jesus is not unrighteousness.
[2082.88 → 2087.88] With Jesus, the dealbreaker is self-satisfaction.
[2087.88 → 2093.88] If you're thinking, you know, I'm pretty much as good as I want to be.
[2093.88 → 2096.88] I mean, I'm better than most people.
[2096.88 → 2100.88] I'm not like them, whoever them is.
[2100.88 → 2103.88] There's always them, whoever it is.
[2103.88 → 2110.88] If you're thinking that way, your self-satisfaction is keeping you from God.
[2110.88 → 2117.88] And so I think in this beatitude, Jesus is really inviting us to get closer to him.
[2117.88 → 2118.88] Right?
[2118.88 → 2121.88] Let's just join the sinners.
[2121.88 → 2129.88] Let's send all pretense away that we are good enough and say, like the Apostle Paul,
[2129.88 → 2133.88] wretched man that I am, who will deliver me?
[2133.88 → 2137.88] And if we say that, Jesus will respond to us, I will.
[2137.88 → 2139.88] I will deliver you.
[2139.88 → 2142.88] And we draw close to God.
[2142.88 → 2147.88] And so it's not our righteousness that is blessed.
[2147.88 → 2150.88] It's our hunger for righteousness that is blessed.
[2150.88 → 2153.88] And that distinction, friends, is so important.
[2153.88 → 2160.88] In other words, the blessing begins by acknowledging that this is something that we are missing.
[2160.88 → 2161.88] Right?
[2161.88 → 2163.88] That there is something lacking in ourselves.
[2163.88 → 2168.88] There's something lacking in the depths of our being and in emptiness in our world that we cannot fill.
[2168.88 → 2181.88] And then when we are grasped by the gospel, God awakens us with this new appetite, a hunger and a thirst for righteousness.
[2181.88 → 2186.88] Because we don't have it and the world doesn't have it, and we are hungry for it.
[2186.88 → 2191.88] And so we desire it deeply.
[2191.88 → 2198.88] And so when we look at this word, righteousness, what is it that Jesus says that we should hunger and thirst for?
[2198.88 → 2200.88] What does righteousness mean?
[2200.88 → 2205.88] It's a word that we find all throughout the Bible.
[2205.88 → 2209.88] And it's a word that is used in a few different ways.
[2209.88 → 2213.88] So first, righteousness refers to the righteousness of God.
[2213.88 → 2220.88] And it's often in this way translated not righteousness, but salvation or deliverance.
[2220.88 → 2226.88] So God's righteousness is him delivering Israel out of slavery in Egypt.
[2226.88 → 2231.88] Or it's restoring them out of exile in Babylon and bringing them home.
[2231.88 → 2238.88] And of course, it is most on display when God sends his beloved son into the world to bring redemption.
[2238.88 → 2245.88] This is the righteousness of God, his mighty acts of salvation, his saving works.
[2245.88 → 2250.88] So in Jeremiah chapter 9 verse 25, this is what God says.
[2250.88 → 2258.88] He says, I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth.
[2258.88 → 2263.88] For in these I delight, declares the Lord.
[2263.88 → 2264.88] Right?
[2264.88 → 2267.88] And so righteousness is the very character of God.
[2267.88 → 2269.88] God is a righteous God.
[2269.88 → 2277.88] And he, out of his own character, he exercises righteousness and justice on earth.
[2277.88 → 2281.88] So that's one way that we see the Bible talk about righteousness.
[2281.88 → 2287.88] Second, the word righteousness is also used in terms of living our lives rightly.
[2287.88 → 2288.88] Right?
[2288.88 → 2290.88] It's about personal holiness.
[2290.88 → 2294.88] It's about doing God's will and living according to God's ways.
[2294.88 → 2300.88] And more often than not in Matthew's Gospel, when he uses this word righteousness,
[2300.88 → 2305.88] it is about how we are seeking to live our lives in light of the kingdom of God.
[2305.88 → 2307.88] In light of who God is.
[2307.88 → 2310.88] In light of the way that Jesus calls us to follow him.
[2310.88 → 2313.88] And to live into his kingdom ways.
[2313.88 → 2321.88] And so for example, in the Gospel of Matthew, when Joseph learns that Mary is mysteriously pregnant,
[2321.88 → 2325.88] Matthew refers to Joseph as a righteous man.
[2325.88 → 2332.88] Because he is not going to publicly shame her and cause her to become vulnerable to abuse in that society.
[2332.88 → 2335.88] So he is righteous.
[2335.88 → 2343.88] So it is the righteousness of God and God's calcific acts in the world.
[2343.88 → 2352.88] It is our own personal holiness, this inner disposition to be conformed into the image of God, to be holy as God is holy.
[2352.88 → 2353.88] It's righteousness.
[2353.88 → 2356.88] But then there is this final way the word righteousness is used in the Bible.
[2356.88 → 2358.88] And it is the word for justice.
[2358.88 → 2362.88] And actually the word righteousness and justice is the same Greek word.
[2362.88 → 2369.88] And this is about the rule and the reign of God breaking into the whole world.
[2369.88 → 2373.88] It's about concern for the vulnerable and the needy.
[2373.88 → 2379.88] And caring for our neighbour in ways that bring life and flourishing and goodness and justice to them.
[2379.88 → 2388.88] And so during the time of the Roman Empire, in the year 258, there was a young man named Lawrence.
[2388.88 → 2395.88] Lawrence was only 22 years old, and he was ordained as the chief deacon of the Church of Rome.
[2395.88 → 2399.88] And so this was a lot of responsibility.
[2399.88 → 2405.88] He was put in charge of the treasury of the church and the distribution of money to the poor.
[2405.88 → 2417.88] Well, under the persecution of Emperor Valerian, the governor of Rome went to Lawrence and demanded that he turn over all the riches of the church to the Roman authorities.
[2417.88 → 2423.88] So Lawrence, he asked for three days to gather the church's wealth.
[2423.88 → 2429.88] He then proceeded to give away as much of the church's money to the poor as he could.
[2429.88 → 2432.88] I'm going to share a painting of this.
[2432.88 → 2440.88] There's Lawrence with the wealth of the church, all these things, and he's just giving it to the poor.
[2440.88 → 2456.88] And then when the third day arrived, he gathered all the beggars, all the crippled, all the widows, all the blind, and he presented them to the governor as the true riches of the church.
[2456.88 → 2463.88] Well, the governor was not amused and Lawrence was sentenced to death.
[2463.88 → 2465.88] Interesting tidbit I learned.
[2465.88 → 2468.88] Lawrence is the chief saint of comedians.
[2468.88 → 2472.88] So he thought that was hilarious.
[2472.88 → 2482.88] Anyway, throughout church history, Lawrence has been looked to as someone who embodied what it means to hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[2482.88 → 2495.88] And so when you step back, when you gather all that the Bible says about righteousness, that it is God saving acts, and that it is personal holiness, and it is social justice.
[2495.88 → 2514.88] The picture of righteousness that Jesus promises is of a renewed universe, enjoyed forever by perfected human beings under King Jesus, the Lord of grace.
[2514.88 → 2515.88] Right?
[2515.88 → 2517.88] It's not just this hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[2517.88 → 2521.88] It's not just being a little bit better you.
[2521.88 → 2523.88] It's not just a patched up you.
[2523.88 → 2543.88] It is a renovated universe where all of us as former sinners are now fully alive in resurrection bodies, incapable any longer of sin or suffering or death, romping and playing forever in an amazing world under the smile of Jesus.
[2543.88 → 2545.88] That is righteousness.
[2545.88 → 2549.88] Friends, that is a world of righteousness.
[2549.88 → 2552.88] That is the righteousness that God is accomplishing.
[2552.88 → 2558.88] That is the kingdom of God in heaven as on earth.
[2558.88 → 2561.88] Sorry, on earth as in heaven.
[2561.88 → 2571.88] And Jesus is saying, blessed are those who sense just how lacking that kind of righteousness is and who feel hungry and famished for it.
[2571.88 → 2575.88] Who yearn for it, who long for it in themselves and in this world.
[2575.88 → 2582.88] And again, Jesus is saying, you don't have to deserve it.
[2582.88 → 2585.88] You don't have to be in a state of perfect righteousness.
[2585.88 → 2588.88] Jesus says, I died to give it to you.
[2588.88 → 2590.88] But you've got a hunger for it.
[2590.88 → 2595.88] You've got to feel thirsty for it.
[2595.88 → 2599.88] Or you will be self-satisfied.
[2599.88 → 2604.88] And Jesus has come to give us this, this feast.
[2604.88 → 2608.88] And if we come before him and say, I don't really hunger for these things.
[2608.88 → 2613.88] He's going to come to us and say, you're full.
[2613.88 → 2614.88] You're okay.
[2614.88 → 2616.88] He's going to say, I'm so sorry.
[2616.88 → 2619.88] You do not know what you are missing.
[2619.88 → 2626.88] And that brings us to the second part of this beatitude where it says, for they will be filled.
[2626.88 → 2629.88] Okay, so let's read the beatitude once more together.
[2629.88 → 2634.88] It says, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[2634.88 → 2640.88] So this beatitude is declaring something.
[2640.88 → 2647.88] It's declaring that if you hunger and thirst for righteousness, you are blessed.
[2647.88 → 2649.88] Why?
[2649.88 → 2650.88] Why are you blessed?
[2650.88 → 2653.88] Because you will be filled.
[2653.88 → 2655.88] You will be satisfied.
[2655.88 → 2660.88] That's what makes this hunger blessed is the promise that you will be filled.
[2660.88 → 2667.88] And when you have that hunger for righteousness, that hunger for God's kingdom, he is going to fill that.
[2667.88 → 2669.88] He is going to meet you in that hunger.
[2669.88 → 2676.88] That hunger is not going to go unsatisfied and disappointed and unmet like so many things in life.
[2676.88 → 2680.88] But it will be fulfilled.
[2680.88 → 2689.88] And the promise satisfaction of our longing is, of course, ultimately wrapped up in and found in Jesus Christ.
[2689.88 → 2691.88] And we see this in Jesus's life.
[2691.88 → 2697.88] And we also see it in the way, the things that Jesus said, the way he reveals himself.
[2697.88 → 2709.88] And so when we hear Jesus in Matthew 3.15 say that he has come to fulfill all righteousness, we're meant to understand the fullness of that word.
[2709.88 → 2714.88] That he is the God of righteousness breaking into the world.
[2714.88 → 2724.88] And that he is going to overflow and fill the world with righteousness and justice in every place where sin and brokenness and injustice reign.
[2724.88 → 2731.88] In John 6, Jesus declares to us, I am the bread of life.
[2731.88 → 2735.88] Whoever comes to me will never go hungry.
[2735.88 → 2739.88] And whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
[2739.88 → 2747.88] And then in John chapter seven, he says, let everyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.
[2747.88 → 2754.88] Whoever believes in me, as scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.
[2754.88 → 2758.88] And so this is the invitation of Jesus.
[2758.88 → 2764.88] To come to him and to freely receive the righteousness that only he can truly give us.
[2764.88 → 2770.88] And then part of what it means to be a Christian is to be so centred on Jesus Christ.
[2770.88 → 2776.88] That who he is in all of his righteousness, the righteous and just character of God.
[2776.88 → 2779.88] That begins to take shape in us.
[2779.88 → 2787.88] And it begins to flow out of us and shape the way we engage in every part of this world.
[2787.88 → 2791.88] In our personal lives and in our public lives.
[2791.88 → 2797.88] In our homes and in our families and our schools and our workplaces and in the public sphere.
[2797.88 → 2806.88] And then not only do we read about Jesus's promises to us to fill us and satisfy us in scripture.
[2806.88 → 2813.88] But also there have been Christians down through the ages who have spoken of Jesus in terms of pleasure.
[2813.88 → 2815.88] And in terms of satisfaction.
[2815.88 → 2818.88] Because that's who he is.
[2818.88 → 2825.88] So for example, Augustine describes his conversion.
[2825.88 → 2827.88] And this is how he describes it.
[2827.88 → 2829.88] He says,
[2829.88 → 2840.88] How sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys, which I had once feared to lose.
[2840.88 → 2847.88] You drove them from me, you who are the true, the sovereign joy.
[2847.88 → 2859.88] You drove them from me and took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure.
[2859.88 → 2862.88] Have you ever felt what he's talking about?
[2862.88 → 2866.88] That if I follow Jesus, I'm just going to have to give up so much.
[2866.88 → 2868.88] I'm going to be such a martyr.
[2868.88 → 2871.88] I won't be able to enjoy life anymore.
[2871.88 → 2878.88] Well, Augustine was a guy who sought out and experienced the common pleasures of life.
[2878.88 → 2884.88] The stuff that most humankind has pursued.
[2884.88 → 2887.88] Academic achievement, rising to the top.
[2887.88 → 2889.88] Worldly pleasures of different sorts.
[2889.88 → 2899.88] And he discovered when he became a Christian that it is not so much giving up, but replacing those things with an even greater joy and satisfaction.
[2899.88 → 2903.88] And that that greater joy and satisfaction is God himself.
[2903.88 → 2911.88] Then finally, I'll close with this quote by Samuel Rutherford, who was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.
[2911.88 → 2914.88] Ross, yes.
[2914.88 → 2915.88] Okay.
[2915.88 → 2917.88] So here's what he says.
[2917.88 → 2926.88] There is enough in our Lord's kitchen to satisfy all of his children and enough wine in his cellar to quench all their thirst.
[2926.88 → 2929.88] Hunger for him until he fills you.
[2929.88 → 2934.88] He is pleased with the importunity of hungry souls.
[2934.88 → 2939.88] Who knows who importunity means?
[2939.88 → 2942.88] Okay, I had to look it up too.
[2942.88 → 2945.88] It means impatience.
[2945.88 → 2947.88] It means persistence.
[2947.88 → 2952.88] It means even being persistent to the point of annoyance.
[2952.88 → 2963.88] He is pleased when we annoy him when we are persistent because of our deep hunger and thirst for his righteousness.
[2963.88 → 2970.88] He says, go to him like a child, an annoying child who is always asking to be filled with things.
[2970.88 → 2971.88] But we go to God.
[2971.88 → 2976.88] And it says, hunger for him until he fills you.
[2976.88 → 2978.88] There is enough.
[2978.88 → 2988.88] And that word fill does not mean just pour your drink to the top.
[2988.88 → 2991.88] It actually means to overflow.
[2991.88 → 2995.88] It means to spill out all over the place.
[2995.88 → 3005.88] Because he provides in abundance for what we most truly long for and what we most truly need.
[3005.88 → 3009.88] So let's pray together.
[3009.88 → 3014.88] Father, we thank you that you satisfy our deepest longings.
[3014.88 → 3020.88] Father, when we hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[3020.88 → 3023.88] For your saving mercy in our lives.
[3023.88 → 3026.88] To be transformed to become more like God.
[3026.88 → 3031.88] And we're putting aside all of our own wretchedness and our own sin.
[3031.88 → 3032.88] Being transformed.
[3032.88 → 3036.88] And then, Lord, seeking that transformation to come into all the earth.
[3036.88 → 3038.88] Lord, we long for righteousness.
[3038.88 → 3043.88] And, Lord, we thank you for your promise.
[3043.88 → 3046.88] That you will satisfy that longing.
[3046.88 → 3047.88] That longing.
[3047.88 → 3049.88] The most important hunger that we have.
[3049.88 → 3051.88] Lord, you will satisfy it.
[3051.88 → 3058.88] And you are even now satisfying it as we can taste and see that God is good.
[3058.88 → 3061.88] And we can experience that goodness in our own lives.
[3061.88 → 3063.88] That new affection.
[3063.88 → 3067.88] So, Lord, would you work that in us.
[3067.88 → 3073.88] Lord, by your Holy Spirit, would you make us blessed hungered.
[3073.88 → 3075.88] Those who long for your kingdom.
[3075.88 → 3076.88] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[3076.88 → 3077.88] Amen.
[3077.88 → 3079.88] So, friends, let's stand.
[3079.88 → 3081.88] And our song of response is,
[3081.88 → 3084.88] My soul longs for the Lord.
[3084.88 → 3087.88] Please rise and let's sing our song of response together.
[3105.88 → 3106.88] My soul longs for the Lord.
[3106.88 → 3107.88] In a weary land.
[3107.88 → 3108.88] Well, so dry, and I am empty.
[3108.88 → 3121.88] All made dust in my hands.
[3121.88 → 3125.88] How I am for strength of mercy.
[3125.88 → 3129.88] Where my soul can be restored.
[3129.88 → 3130.88] Come and drink.
[3130.88 → 3133.88] Jesus calls me.
[3133.88 → 3137.88] And you will thirst no more.
[3137.88 → 3138.88] For the fullness of Christ.
[3138.88 → 3139.88] Word of God.
[3139.88 → 3140.88] Word of life.
[3140.88 → 3141.88] Word of life.
[3141.88 → 3142.88] Word of life.
[3142.88 → 3143.88] God of life.
[3143.88 → 3155.88] In words you walked among us.
[3155.88 → 3158.88] I am in you well.
[3158.88 → 3166.66] And you spoke into the darkness with the powers of hell.
[3167.22 → 3174.84] Grace and mercy flowed from Calvary to the valleys of all need.
[3175.34 → 3182.36] It is done, it is finished, from every sin set free.
[3182.36 → 3191.52] Oh, the victory of Christ, word of God, word of life.
[3196.56 → 3203.94] My soul longs to long closer with the Lord I serve.
[3204.46 → 3211.86] More than riches, more than favour, I delight in your word.
[3211.86 → 3215.72] Turn my place from all that's worthless.
[3216.40 → 3220.02] Set my heart on things above.
[3220.50 → 3227.88] May my life tell your goodness, your weight of truth and love.
[3228.38 → 3235.70] Oh, the wisdom of Christ, word of God, word of life.
[3241.86 → 3242.86] Thank you.
[3251.92 → 3257.52] At this point, I'd like to invite the deacons up to take this morning's offering, which is for South Delta Meals on Wheels.

[3386.02 → 3393.18] Let us come before our God in our time of congregational prayer.
[3397.28 → 3403.68] Righteous Heavenly Father, our King and our God, we exalt you and glorify you this morning.
[3404.60 → 3408.92] Author of creation, you came down and dwelt among the least.
[3408.92 → 3419.68] We thank you, Lord, for your death on the cross, which paid the debt of our many sins, and for your resurrection, through which we may come to eternal life.
[3420.54 → 3427.90] May we be compelled to sing your praises from the depths of our very souls, for you alone are worthy.
[3428.96 → 3436.02] We thank you, Lord, for this earth, for Canada, for this community here in Ladder, and for this congregation of believers.
[3436.02 → 3443.56] It is our privilege to be called followers, indeed children, of the one true living God.
[3444.26 → 3445.62] We pray for this church.
[3446.04 → 3447.94] Guide our work through your Holy Spirit.
[3448.80 → 3459.58] Turn our hearts towards love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[3459.58 → 3466.54] May we always hunger and thirst for righteousness, as this is what Jesus asks of his disciples.
[3467.54 → 3476.48] May we be deeply pained and, yes, even angry when we see or hear of oppression or violence or suffering or neglect or cruelty or wickedness.
[3476.48 → 3481.56] May we be deeply pained and, yes, even if we pray for the victims of the world, for the victims of the war in Ukraine.
[3481.56 → 3490.84] May we pray for the victims of the war in Ukraine, but also for people suffering war and famine in places outside the media spotlight, such as Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Sudan.
[3491.64 → 3495.56] You know their suffering, and you hear their bitter cries of anguish.
[3495.56 → 3525.54] May we pray for the victims of the church.
[3525.56 → 3530.28] Hidden under a basket, nor hidden under this building we sit in this morning.
[3531.16 → 3535.68] May we, as your children, be vessels of your goodness and channels of your peace.
[3537.32 → 3542.22] Closer to home, Lord, this congregation carries very real and painful burdens.
[3542.22 → 3560.50] This morning, we lift and pray for Pat, Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Jerry, and Anne, Quinn, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, Henry, and Eileen.
[3560.50 → 3569.16] Merciful Lord, we pray, too, for the healing of Jordan, that you may be with him and Vanessa and the whole family.
[3570.14 → 3578.66] Grant wisdom to the doctors who treat him and ease his daily pain, and especially, Lord, on the days when he is undergoing treatment,
[3579.22 → 3581.86] for the burden is especially heavy on those days.
[3581.86 → 3586.36] We pray, too, for Pastor Nancy, who is recovering from surgery.
[3587.16 → 3593.54] May the work of the surgeons be successful, and may she be restored to full health as you continue your kingdom work.
[3594.18 → 3600.62] We praise you this morning, for she has joined us to preach the word, and we thank you for that, Lord.
[3600.62 → 3604.74] We ask for your healing for Jake's sister, Amy.
[3605.20 → 3610.24] Grant her a full measure of your strength and mercy as she deals with her diagnosis and treatment.
[3611.40 → 3617.40] Heavenly Father, it is a long list, and we know that even, yet it is not complete.
[3618.26 → 3623.96] While we may not know all the hurt in this world, you know each one of us and suffer alongside us.
[3624.76 → 3627.98] Be with those who suffer the endless battle against lifelong illnesses,
[3627.98 → 3633.16] for those struggling against the daily pain of chronic and old age,
[3633.82 → 3639.84] and for those suffering with mental illness, depression, addiction, or even with loneliness,
[3640.52 → 3646.12] for those grieving the loss of a loved one, for those among us facing the effects of old age.
[3647.22 → 3650.26] But, Lord, we ask, too, that you come quickly.
[3651.20 → 3654.68] We long for the day of a new heaven and a new earth,
[3654.68 → 3657.58] where every tear is wiped from our eyes,
[3657.98 → 3662.46] and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain.
[3663.34 → 3666.50] Lord, give us everything we stand in need of,
[3666.76 → 3668.88] and guard us against everything we don't.
[3669.66 → 3674.42] May your kingdom come and your will, not ours, be done.
[3675.16 → 3677.72] We pray this all in Jesus' powerful name.
[3678.46 → 3678.68] Amen.
[3678.68 → 3678.80] Amen.
[3678.80 → 3678.84] Amen.

[3699.48 → 3700.64] and to enjoy some coffee.
[3701.18 → 3705.44] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[3705.44 → 3710.60] Brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3710.92 → 3712.20] and the love of God the Father,
[3713.14 → 3715.24] and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,

[3794.34 → 3799.70] glory to your name.

[3805.80 → 3811.00] you have taken all our shame.
[3812.00 → 3817.04] Spirit, who still melts hearts of stone,
[3817.04 → 3821.56] will never be the same.
[3821.56 → 3827.30] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
[3827.30 → 3833.18] hallelujah to the one true God.
[3833.18 → 3841.26] Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[3841.80 → 3857.78] Father, Son, and I have God.
[3860.46 → 3860.72] Amen.
[3860.72 → 3861.06] Amen.
[3861.06 → 3862.56] Amen.
