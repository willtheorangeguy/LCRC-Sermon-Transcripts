[217.70 → 219.70] Amen.
[219.70 → 221.70] Amen.
[221.70 → 223.70] Wow.
[223.70 → 225.70] Good morning.
[225.70 → 227.70] Good morning.
[227.70 → 229.70] Nice to see you all here.
[229.70 → 235.70] Although there are some extra spaces here this morning, so let's hope you're tuning in from afar.
[235.70 → 239.70] Welcome to you all here at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[239.70 → 247.70] I see from the banner here this morning that it's Pentecost Sunday, the time at which the Spirit first made a very obvious appearance.
[247.70 → 251.70] We celebrate today during the time of Acts.
[251.70 → 254.70] We actually read Acts 2 this morning.
[254.70 → 257.70] I recommend you looking it over again today.
[257.70 → 259.70] It was quite an amazing event.
[259.70 → 265.70] Today, Pastor Jason True will continue the series of A Vision for Renewal.
[265.70 → 275.70] We'll also celebrate some baptisms this morning later on of Jackie C, Tiffany Go, and their two children Genevieve and Jacqueline.
[275.70 → 278.70] Coffee time on Thursdays.
[278.70 → 287.70] If you haven't been coming since October, every Thursday morning, we've been having a time of coffee for at least 10, sometimes as many as 25 different people.
[287.70 → 289.70] Well, it's over for the season.
[289.70 → 293.70] If you come next week, you'll have to make your own coffee.
[293.70 → 299.70] But we'll start again in September, so stay tuned for the exact time.
[299.70 → 303.70] Today's offering is for Resident Global Mission.
[303.70 → 311.70] This agency of the CRC, Christian Reformed Church, shares the good news of Jesus Christ here in North America and around the globe.
[311.70 → 319.70] It supports missionaries, campus ministries, training biblical church leaders, supporting church plants, and many other educational causes.
[319.70 → 326.70] For our church, we in particular support the UMR AMS mission work in Egypt.
[326.70 → 335.70] And I understand John and BEV went to Egypt very recently, primarily to check in on the UMR AMS and make sure it was a worthy cause this morning.
[335.70 → 339.70] So anyway, that's the cause this morning.
[339.70 → 341.70] Give generously.
[341.70 → 350.70] Yeah, the Bible readings, once again, another cycle of the bookmarks have been inserted in your bulletin this morning,
[350.70 → 359.70] and there was a new round of recommended readings for the next several months, I think.
[359.70 → 365.70] Will you join me in an opening prayer of adoration?
[365.70 → 369.70] Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the universe.
[369.70 → 372.70] You have made all creation to worship you.
[372.70 → 376.70] You call us to worship you now in this time and place.
[376.70 → 383.70] As we prepare for worship, we pray that you will quiet our hearts, that we may hear your voice in your word.
[383.70 → 388.70] We pray that you will stir our hearts, that we may more faithfully follow Jesus,
[388.70 → 393.70] and that you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer.
[393.70 → 399.70] Bless those who lead us in worship with your spirit, especially on this Sunday.
[399.70 → 404.70] May our worship today help us to offer our entire lives to you,
[404.70 → 407.70] and unite us with your whole church throughout the world.
[407.70 → 413.70] We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Spirit is one God.
[413.70 → 416.70] Amen.
[416.70 → 421.70] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 92, the first two stanzas.
[421.70 → 426.70] It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High,
[426.70 → 430.70] proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness.
[430.70 → 434.70] The Lord's greeting to you comes from Isaiah 42.
[434.70 → 437.70] I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness.
[437.70 → 440.70] I have taken you by the hand and kept you.
[440.70 → 445.70] I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations,
[445.70 → 447.70] to open the eyes that are blind.
[447.70 → 450.70] I am the Lord, that is my name.
[450.70 → 456.70] My glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.
[458.70 → 462.70] Let's sing a couple of songs of praise this morning before our baptisms.
[462.70 → 465.70] Let's sing in the Arduino close He art and find the name of Jesus Christ,
[465.70 → 467.70] My glory I give to Notre Purple, and Lord subkey Adam changing this morning.
[467.70 → 471.70] And I see you naked Ciudad on home from Jesus Christ,
[471.70 → 476.70] your eyes become my love, you're pose to my love in the desert.
[476.70 → 477.70] It's called my Kris Jonathan dominance,
[477.70 → 478.70] Amen.
[478.70 → 479.70] She was resurrection of the miracles of Messiah.
[479.70 → 482.70] Let work together about their faithfulness in Jerusalem,
[482.70 → 485.70] and she has Borough buns for Xia Wang Fewest,

[487.70 → 490.70] We Black destroyed the years on our UNT Tudor Lewis presents or the Mat lots

[495.38 → 499.58] Who else can make every king bow down?
[500.64 → 504.46] Who else can whisper the darkest tremble?
[505.46 → 508.96] Only a holy God.
[511.86 → 515.66] What other beauty demands such praises?
[515.66 → 521.34] What other splendour I'll shine the sun?
[522.34 → 526.42] What other majesty proves which I praise?
[527.46 → 530.58] Only a holy God.
[533.20 → 541.30] Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[541.30 → 549.38] Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[549.72 → 553.10] Come and worship the holy God.
[553.10 → 566.56] One of the glory consumes like fire.
[568.00 → 572.10] One of the power can raise the dead.
[573.16 → 578.10] One of the glory consumes like fire.
[578.10 → 581.40] Only a holy God.
[584.48 → 592.10] Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[592.10 → 599.10] Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.

[604.00 → 626.88] Come and worship the holy God.
[626.88 → 650.64] Who else can rescue me from my killing?
[650.64 → 655.64] Who else will not offer His only Son?
[656.98 → 660.88] Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[662.32 → 665.64] Only a holy God.
[666.52 → 670.02] Only my holy God.
[670.02 → 672.02] Come and worship the holy God.
[672.02 → 677.02] Come and worship the holy God.
[677.02 → 692.02] Come and worship the holy God.
[692.02 → 692.28] Where?
[701.90 → 703.34] Amen.
[706.04 → 711.40] Moment.
[711.40 → 716.00] Be still for the presence of all.
[716.00 → 722.86] Be still for the presence of the Lord
[722.86 → 728.00] The Holy God is here
[728.00 → 733.36] Come now before Him now
[733.36 → 739.16] With reverence and fear
[739.16 → 744.64] In Him no sin is found
[744.64 → 749.64] Be still on holy ground
[749.64 → 754.88] Be still for the presence of the Lord
[754.88 → 760.36] The Holy One is here
[760.36 → 765.64] Be still for the glory of the Lord
[766.18 → 770.54] Is shining all around
[770.54 → 775.54] He burns with holy fire
[775.54 → 780.54] With splendour His crown
[780.54 → 787.54] Thou awesome is the sight
[787.54 → 792.54] Our raided King of light
[792.54 → 797.54] Be still for the glory of the Lord
[797.54 → 801.54] Is shining all around
[801.54 → 808.54] Be still for the power of the Lord
[808.54 → 814.54] Is moving in His place
[814.54 → 819.54] He comes to bless and heal
[819.54 → 824.54] To ministers His grace
[824.54 → 830.54] No work too hard for Him
[830.54 → 836.54] In faith we see from Him
[836.54 → 841.54] Be still for the power of the Lord
[841.54 → 846.54] Is moving in His place
[846.54 → 850.54] You may be seated
[850.54 → 851.54] Be seated
[851.54 → 871.60] So it is our great joy today
[871.60 → 874.96] To baptize this family
[874.96 → 876.34] Who is coming up now
[876.34 → 877.90] And you'll be able to meet them in a moment
[877.90 → 881.34] And to receive them into Christ's church
[881.34 → 882.18] And as they're coming
[882.18 → 883.54] I'll just begin an introduction
[883.54 → 887.40] So today as John told us
[887.40 → 890.10] Is the day of Pentecost
[890.10 → 891.12] Right? Pentecost
[891.12 → 893.40] And on the day of Pentecost
[893.40 → 895.50] The Holy Spirit was poured out
[895.50 → 897.70] Onto Jesus' followers
[897.70 → 899.14] In that upper room in Jerusalem
[899.14 → 902.72] And as the Spirit was poured out
[902.72 → 904.70] They were filled with the Holy Spirit
[904.70 → 907.44] And as a result
[907.44 → 909.98] They began to praise God
[909.98 → 912.44] In all of these various languages
[912.44 → 913.34] So all the people
[913.34 → 914.66] Who were gathered in Jerusalem
[914.66 → 917.74] They heard Jesus' disciples
[917.74 → 918.96] Speaking in languages
[918.96 → 920.00] Their own languages
[920.00 → 921.58] From all around the Mediterranean
[921.58 → 923.56] And they asked
[923.56 → 925.10] What does this mean?
[925.10 → 926.58] What is going on here?
[927.56 → 928.30] And so Peter
[928.30 → 929.78] He preached
[929.78 → 930.80] Kind of the first sermon
[930.80 → 933.64] After Jesus rose again
[933.64 → 935.36] The first sermon
[935.36 → 936.46] To these Jews
[936.46 → 937.64] And he said
[937.64 → 938.86] What this means
[938.86 → 940.22] Is that Jesus is the Messiah
[940.22 → 941.82] That the promise
[941.82 → 943.24] Of the Holy Spirit to come
[943.24 → 944.64] Has been fulfilled
[944.64 → 947.92] When the people heard this
[947.92 → 949.84] It says they were cut to the heart
[949.84 → 951.86] And they said to Peter
[951.86 → 952.86] And the other apostles
[952.86 → 954.36] Brothers what shall we do?
[954.36 → 955.24] What shall we do
[955.24 → 956.64] In response to this Jesus?
[957.32 → 958.60] And the Spirit who has come
[958.60 → 960.52] Peter replied
[960.52 → 961.36] And he said this
[961.36 → 963.08] Repent
[963.08 → 964.70] And be baptized
[964.70 → 966.16] Every one of you
[966.16 → 967.54] In the name of Jesus Christ
[967.54 → 968.64] For the forgiveness
[968.64 → 969.54] Of your sins
[969.54 → 970.86] And you will receive
[970.86 → 972.18] The gift of the Holy Spirit
[972.18 → 974.06] The promise is for you
[974.06 → 975.52] For your children
[975.52 → 977.52] For all who are far off
[977.52 → 980.02] For all whom the Lord
[980.02 → 981.92] Our God will call
[981.92 → 983.58] And so today
[983.58 → 985.42] We have here
[985.42 → 985.94] Jackie
[985.94 → 987.24] And Tiffany
[987.24 → 989.08] And Genevieve
[989.08 → 989.66] And Jacqueline
[989.66 → 990.92] You're Genevieve
[990.92 → 991.74] And you're Jacqueline
[991.74 → 992.24] Right?
[992.80 → 993.28] Yes
[993.28 → 994.12] Okay
[994.12 → 994.80] Perfect
[994.80 → 995.96] All right
[995.96 → 996.96] And so they come
[996.96 → 997.80] And they come
[997.80 → 998.86] To claim these promises
[998.86 → 999.42] Of God
[999.42 → 1001.10] That all who call
[1001.10 → 1002.16] Upon the name of the Lord
[1002.16 → 1003.18] All who are far off
[1003.18 → 1003.50] And friends
[1003.50 → 1003.90] That's us
[1003.90 → 1004.62] We're the ones
[1004.62 → 1005.34] Who are far off
[1005.34 → 1007.50] We can claim
[1007.50 → 1008.46] These promises of God
[1008.46 → 1009.46] That we can be forgiven
[1009.46 → 1010.26] Of our sins
[1010.26 → 1011.74] Cleansed by the Holy Spirit
[1011.74 → 1013.32] And it is for us
[1013.32 → 1014.26] And for our children
[1014.26 → 1015.62] And so
[1015.62 → 1017.26] And so we will be
[1017.26 → 1018.34] Baptizing them today
[1018.34 → 1019.18] And you know
[1019.18 → 1021.00] Just as a wedding ring
[1021.00 → 1021.86] You know
[1021.86 → 1022.78] We have a wedding ring here
[1022.78 → 1023.74] Just as a wedding ring
[1023.74 → 1025.02] Is a symbol
[1025.02 → 1027.08] Of the relationship
[1027.08 → 1028.68] That a husband and wife
[1028.68 → 1029.34] Have together
[1029.34 → 1030.52] So baptism
[1030.52 → 1031.44] In the same way
[1031.44 → 1032.70] Is an outward symbol
[1032.70 → 1034.14] Of God's relationship
[1034.14 → 1035.04] To us as people
[1035.04 → 1035.78] Okay
[1035.78 → 1037.84] It's a physical sign
[1037.84 → 1039.92] That gives expression
[1039.92 → 1041.14] To this relationship
[1041.14 → 1042.22] That we have with God
[1042.22 → 1045.10] And so just as
[1045.10 → 1047.66] This water
[1047.66 → 1048.76] Is what they symbolize
[1048.76 → 1050.02] Is our cleansing
[1050.02 → 1051.16] The water of course
[1051.16 → 1052.08] Is a symbol of cleansing
[1052.08 → 1053.54] It's a symbol
[1053.54 → 1054.62] Of our being united
[1054.62 → 1055.42] To Christ
[1055.42 → 1056.00] And his death
[1056.00 → 1056.56] And resurrection
[1056.56 → 1058.12] And it's a symbol
[1058.12 → 1059.52] Of us being adopted
[1059.52 → 1060.52] Into his family
[1060.52 → 1061.18] The church
[1061.18 → 1063.46] So
[1063.46 → 1064.32] Hey Genevieve
[1064.32 → 1064.76] And Jacqueline
[1064.76 → 1065.38] Look at this
[1065.38 → 1067.40] Look
[1067.40 → 1069.14] You want to see
[1069.14 → 1069.64] What it is
[1069.64 → 1072.24] There's the water
[1072.24 → 1073.18] Okay
[1073.18 → 1073.64] So I'm going to
[1073.64 → 1074.58] Pour it in here
[1074.58 → 1077.64] There it is
[1077.64 → 1080.70] Okay
[1080.70 → 1081.78] And so just as
[1081.78 → 1082.26] The water
[1082.26 → 1082.62] What do you do
[1082.62 → 1083.04] With water
[1083.04 → 1083.88] When you take a bath
[1083.88 → 1085.96] What does it do
[1085.96 → 1087.64] It makes us clean
[1087.64 → 1087.90] Right
[1087.90 → 1089.18] Yeah
[1089.18 → 1090.18] And so this water
[1090.18 → 1091.60] It
[1091.60 → 1092.80] It does
[1092.80 → 1093.38] This water
[1093.38 → 1095.60] Doesn't cleanse our hearts
[1095.60 → 1097.36] But God cleanses our hearts
[1097.36 → 1098.48] And this water
[1098.48 → 1100.22] Helps us remember that
[1100.22 → 1101.86] That Jesus
[1101.86 → 1103.06] Cleanses our hearts
[1103.06 → 1104.96] He makes us pure
[1104.96 → 1106.68] Because of what
[1106.68 → 1107.84] He has done for us
[1107.84 → 1109.10] Okay
[1109.10 → 1109.60] So
[1109.60 → 1111.22] As
[1111.22 → 1116.70] So as we prepare
[1116.70 → 1117.68] To be baptized
[1117.68 → 1119.78] What are we going to do next
[1119.78 → 1121.42] Is I'm going to ask
[1121.42 → 1122.28] Jackie and Tiffany
[1122.28 → 1123.48] To
[1123.48 → 1126.02] Profess their faith
[1126.02 → 1128.14] By saying some vows
[1128.14 → 1129.26] That we'll have on the screen
[1129.26 → 1131.20] And so
[1131.20 → 1132.32] Jackie and Tiffany
[1132.32 → 1133.74] As you have responded
[1133.74 → 1135.00] To the grace of God
[1135.00 → 1136.18] To believe
[1136.18 → 1137.02] And to be baptized
[1137.02 → 1138.78] I ask you therefore
[1138.78 → 1139.56] Before God
[1139.56 → 1141.04] And before this congregation
[1141.04 → 1143.34] To profess your faith in Jesus
[1143.34 → 1144.04] Okay
[1144.04 → 1144.32] So
[1144.32 → 1145.64] Here are the questions

[1708.74 → 1710.64] Let's stand and sing together
[1710.64 → 1734.06] Be thou my vision
[1734.06 → 1737.74] O Lord of my heart
[1737.74 → 1738.24] Be thou my heart
[1738.24 → 1741.32] Not be all else
[1741.32 → 1743.16] To be saved
[1743.16 → 1745.90] That thou art
[1745.90 → 1748.74] Thou my best thought
[1748.74 → 1753.84] Thy day and my night
[1753.84 → 1756.86] Making O sleeping
[1756.86 → 1761.74] Thy presence my light
[1761.74 → 1765.74] Be thou my wisdom
[1765.74 → 1769.90] Thou my true word
[1769.90 → 1773.36] I ever with thee
[1773.36 → 1775.64] And thou with me
[1775.64 → 1777.36] Lord
[1777.36 → 1781.00] Thou my great Father
[1781.00 → 1784.74] My true Son
[1784.74 → 1787.54] Thou with me
[1787.54 → 1788.40] Thou with me
[1788.40 → 1788.74] Thou with me
[1788.74 → 1791.74] And I with me
[1791.74 → 1797.32] Be thou my shield
[1797.32 → 1799.08] And my sword
[1799.08 → 1801.74] For the fight
[1801.74 → 1805.36] Be thou my dignity
[1805.36 → 1809.54] Be thou my might
[1809.54 → 1811.62] Thou my soul
[1811.62 → 1812.16] Shelter
[1812.16 → 1815.62] And thou my height
[1815.62 → 1817.24] Thou and thou
[1817.24 → 1819.20] Praise thou
[1819.20 → 1825.34] be ever new power of my power.
[1826.60 → 1834.42] Riches I yield not, nor man's empty praise.
[1834.42 → 1841.42] Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
[1841.42 → 1851.42] Thou and Thou only be first in my heart.
[1851.42 → 1860.58] High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art.
[1861.18 → 1868.60] High King of Heaven, when victory is won.
[1868.60 → 1877.96] May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Son.
[1878.46 → 1885.60] God of my own heart, whatever befall.
[1886.88 → 1895.26] Still be my vision, my mother of all.
[1895.26 → 1898.08] Amen.
[1898.26 → 1898.90] You may be seated.
[1898.90 → 1899.90] Amen.
[1900.90 → 1901.90] Amen.
[1901.90 → 1902.90] Amen.
[1902.90 → 1903.90] Amen.
[1903.90 → 1904.90] Amen.
[1904.90 → 1911.84] In our time of confession, we'll do what, well, if you're my age, and you remember the Christian Reformed Church,
[1911.98 → 1917.78] every Sunday morning you were led in the Ten Commandments.
[1918.66 → 1923.26] We don't do that often anymore, but it was thought that maybe we should do it now and again.
[1923.52 → 1929.64] So we'll have a redux this morning of the Ten Commandments that I'll ask you to read each of these Ten Commandments,
[1929.64 → 1937.40] and then I'll follow up with a more modern-day paraphrase of the Commandments that makes it more realistic for our lives.
[1937.90 → 1938.68] Let's begin.
[1939.98 → 1944.56] Please say with me, I am the Lord your God.
[1945.36 → 1949.36] Do not worship any other God than the one true God.
[1949.84 → 1951.86] All other gods are false gods.
[1952.32 → 1953.58] Worship God alone.
[1955.08 → 1958.28] You shall not have no art to me.
[1958.28 → 1962.30] You shall not make any graven image.
[1963.34 → 1966.88] Do not make idols or images in the form of God.
[1967.80 → 1974.42] But further, an idol can be also anything or anyone that you worship by making it more important than God.
[1974.96 → 1982.26] If someone has your time, attention, and affections, it has your worship and could be an idol in your life.
[1982.26 → 1990.88] Do not allow music, TV, computers, or any other thing, activity, or person to be more important in your life than God.
[1990.88 → 1997.42] You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
[1997.42 → 2001.18] Do not treat God's name with disrespect.
[2001.80 → 2006.58] Because of God's importance, his name is always to be spoken of reverently and with honour.
[2007.18 → 2010.00] Do not use God's name lightly or as a swear word.
[2010.50 → 2013.44] How many times have we seen OMG in our texts?
[2013.44 → 2017.04] Always honour God with your words.
[2019.10 → 2022.04] Remember this Sabbath day to keep it holy.
[2023.48 → 2030.06] Dedicate or set aside a regular day each week for rest and worship of the Lord and to be with his family.
[2032.06 → 2034.62] Honour your father and your mother.
[2034.62 → 2039.74] Love and respect your parents at all times, even when you disagree with them.
[2041.30 → 2043.12] You shall not murder.
[2044.46 → 2050.38] Do not deliberately kill a fellow human being further or even think about killing someone.
[2050.66 → 2055.32] But even further, don't hate people or hurt them with words and actions.
[2056.76 → 2059.26] You shall not commit adultery.
[2060.26 → 2063.26] Do not have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse.
[2063.26 → 2066.26] God forbid sex outside the bounds of marriage.
[2066.76 → 2070.48] Even further, respect your body and other people's bodies.
[2071.78 → 2073.72] You shall not steal.
[2074.62 → 2075.78] Yes, do not steal.
[2076.64 → 2082.42] Further, respect the property of other people and do not take anything that belongs to someone else without permission.
[2083.94 → 2088.08] You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.
[2088.08 → 2095.34] Do not tell a lie about someone or bring false accusations against another person.
[2095.72 → 2099.96] But further, tell the truth about everyone and everything at all times.
[2100.84 → 2106.72] And finally, you shall covet your neighbour's house.
[2106.72 → 2112.76] Let's start again.
[2115.24 → 2125.34] You shall not covet your neighbour's house, your neighbour's wife, his slaves, animals, or anything else that is your neighbour's.
[2125.34 → 2129.90] Do not spend time wishing you had what belongs to someone else.
[2129.90 → 2155.24] In thinking about the summary of God's law, we must admit that at times, we have not loved the Lord our God with all our hearts and our souls and with all our minds.
[2155.24 → 2158.48] And we had not always loved our neighbours as ourselves.
[2159.24 → 2162.84] Despite that, the Lord provides assurance of forgiveness.
[2164.00 → 2167.44] Here are the words that are inspired by Psalm 15.
[2167.44 → 2171.60] Those who speak the truth with their heart will abide in God's sanctuary.
[2171.92 → 2176.18] God hears the difficult truths we have named aloud and in the silence of our hearts.
[2176.88 → 2180.30] Now let the wonderful gift of God's forgiveness flow through you.
[2180.96 → 2186.52] May the abundance of God's mercy and grace set you free to serve God with love.
[2186.52 → 2199.38] And from the New Testament in Philippians 4, the same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.
[2200.54 → 2202.28] Let's sing a song of response.
[2202.74 → 2204.34] My faith looks up to thee.
[2205.46 → 2211.44] After the song, the children ages 3 to grade 5 will be dismissed for king's life.
[2212.02 → 2212.54] Kid's life.
[2212.54 → 2234.18] My faith looks up to thee.
[2234.18 → 2239.04] Thou, Lamb of Calvary.
[2239.04 → 2244.68] Saviour, Saviour, be thine.
[2244.68 → 2250.40] Now hear me while I pray.
[2250.90 → 2255.92] Take all my guilt away.
[2255.92 → 2261.02] Oh, let me find this day.
[2261.02 → 2266.36] Be lowly thou.
[2266.36 → 2273.06] May thy rich grace impart.
[2273.06 → 2278.46] Strength to my failing heart.
[2278.46 → 2283.50] My ceiling's fire.
[2283.50 → 2289.38] As thou hast died for me,
[2289.90 → 2294.22] Oh, may my love believe.
[2294.22 → 2305.80] You, Lord, be pure, warm and changeless, be the living fire.
[2305.80 → 2312.58] When life's with grace's blood,
[2312.92 → 2317.70] Death's whole word follows now,
[2317.70 → 2322.96] Be near to me
[2322.96 → 2329.02] Yes, Saviour, then in love
[2329.02 → 2334.46] Fear and distrust renewed
[2334.46 → 2340.20] Though barely safe above
[2340.20 → 2345.52] Redeemed and free
[2347.70 → 2355.48] Beloved and free
[2355.48 → 2358.82] Rated in love
[2358.82 → 2359.82] Amen.
[2388.82 → 2394.48] The New Testament, Book of Matthew, beginning at verse 1.
[2395.22 → 2399.48] In your pew Bibles, if you're following along, it's page 722.
[2407.24 → 2412.02] When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.
[2412.02 → 2416.42] A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said,
[2416.42 → 2419.88] Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean.
[2421.16 → 2424.04] Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man.
[2424.68 → 2427.04] I am willing, he said, be clean.
[2428.04 → 2430.38] Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.
[2431.32 → 2434.86] Then Jesus said to him, see that you don't tell anyone,
[2435.44 → 2442.24] but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
[2442.24 → 2449.30] When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him asking for help.
[2449.96 → 2454.74] Lord, he said, my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.
[2455.86 → 2458.38] Jesus said to him, I will go and heal him.
[2459.04 → 2464.10] The centurion replied, Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof,
[2464.10 → 2467.12] but just say the word and my servant will be healed.
[2467.74 → 2472.56] For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me.
[2473.00 → 2478.74] I tell this one, go, and he goes, and that one come, and he comes.
[2478.88 → 2482.16] I say to my servant, do this, and he does it.
[2482.16 → 2489.02] When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him,
[2489.66 → 2496.22] I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
[2496.88 → 2500.42] I say to you that many will come from the east and the west
[2500.42 → 2506.86] and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
[2506.86 → 2512.18] But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness
[2512.18 → 2514.98] where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[2515.86 → 2521.28] Then Jesus said to the centurion, go, it will be done just as you believed it would.
[2521.56 → 2523.92] And his servant was healed at that very hour.
[2525.38 → 2531.40] When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
[2532.18 → 2534.92] He touched her hand and the fever left her.
[2534.92 → 2537.52] And she got up and began to wait on him.
[2539.24 → 2543.48] When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him.
[2543.84 → 2547.50] And he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
[2548.46 → 2553.00] This was to fill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah.
[2553.46 → 2556.84] He took up our infirmaries and carried our diseases.
[2558.50 → 2559.92] This is the word of the Lord.
[2559.92 → 2560.04] Amen.
[2564.92 → 2587.46] So over the last couple of weeks, we've been in a series called A Vision for Renewal.
[2587.46 → 2590.94] And it was about our revision statement as a church.
[2591.94 → 2596.98] And today, I've actually decided it's not going to be a continuation of that series.
[2597.10 → 2599.34] This is kind of more of a one-off message.
[2599.82 → 2604.40] So what I want to do is just look at this passage about Jesus.
[2605.56 → 2611.24] And our prayer is that we would see the beauty of who Jesus is even more clearly this morning
[2611.24 → 2612.68] as we open up God's word.
[2612.68 → 2616.42] So before we do that, would you please join me in prayer?
[2616.64 → 2617.30] Let's pray together.
[2619.24 → 2620.92] Lord, you are our God.
[2621.66 → 2623.98] And you have been so gracious to us.
[2624.72 → 2629.08] We ask that you would be gracious to us now as we open your word.
[2629.34 → 2633.26] Lord, we rejoice in your promises that your word will never come back empty,
[2633.40 → 2636.80] but it will accomplish the purpose for which it was sent.
[2636.80 → 2640.98] And so we pray, Father, for your spirit to do that work,
[2641.58 → 2643.60] to do the work of softening hearts,
[2644.48 → 2651.28] to do the work of giving us eyes and ears to see Jesus, to hear him.
[2651.96 → 2656.74] We pray, O Lord, for you to do this work that only you can do through your Holy Spirit.
[2657.46 → 2659.12] And we pray it in Jesus' name.
[2659.94 → 2660.30] Amen.
[2660.30 → 2660.42] Amen.
[2662.50 → 2667.74] So I read a story online a while back,
[2668.12 → 2670.74] and it was about some fishermen who went out in their boat.
[2671.46 → 2676.24] And they were out in a bay that was just north of San Francisco.
[2677.40 → 2680.20] So in their little fishing boat,
[2680.78 → 2683.56] they encountered an enormous whale.
[2683.56 → 2692.38] And the whale was in distress because it had been entangled in the ropes from some crab traps.
[2693.04 → 2694.76] And the whale was in real trouble.
[2695.18 → 2699.34] It had obviously been fighting to try to free itself.
[2699.84 → 2701.22] It was struggling to get free.
[2701.60 → 2702.62] And the ropes were actually,
[2703.16 → 2705.54] it was so wound up and the ropes were so tightened,
[2705.68 → 2707.26] the ropes were actually cutting the whale.
[2708.02 → 2709.00] And the whale was bleeding.
[2709.00 → 2712.74] And, you know, because of other predators, this is not good.
[2714.52 → 2718.26] And so the fishermen, with some trepidation, right,
[2718.32 → 2721.74] because this whale is much larger than their little fishing boat,
[2722.26 → 2724.92] they decided to try to help the creature.
[2725.74 → 2729.02] And so they had their hooks that they used for fishing,
[2729.40 → 2735.94] and they would try to hook the ropes that were around this whale and try to cut the ropes.
[2736.40 → 2739.70] And the whale, of course, didn't know what these fishermen were trying to do.
[2740.18 → 2741.50] It wasn't really cooperating.
[2741.60 → 2742.24] It was struggling.
[2742.24 → 2744.18] And yet they tried.
[2744.30 → 2747.66] And they would hook a rope, and they would be able to cut one of the lines loose.
[2748.52 → 2754.52] And somewhere in the process, the whale decided that these fishermen were not foes,
[2754.60 → 2757.32] but that they were friends and that they were actually trying to help.
[2758.36 → 2763.66] And it appeared to these fishermen that the whale actually started assisting them,
[2764.24 → 2768.54] turning its body, exposing the various ropes and things,
[2768.54 → 2771.64] until eventually all the ropes were cut away.
[2771.64 → 2777.92] And the whale, now free, did some circles around the boat,
[2778.50 → 2781.12] kind of very picture-like, kind of like a movie.
[2781.26 → 2781.52] I don't know.
[2781.86 → 2783.34] If you were going to make this up, that's what would happen.
[2783.60 → 2788.60] It kind of circled the boat a couple of times, and then off it went, you know, into the sunset.
[2788.60 → 2792.38] Free and disentangled.
[2793.38 → 2801.64] You know, and as I read that story, what it made me think is that we are often just like that whale.
[2801.64 → 2807.58] We are so often entangled, and we are bound.
[2808.54 → 2808.76] Right?
[2808.82 → 2812.64] We're bound up in our sin, in our shame.
[2813.62 → 2819.18] We're bound by habits, the stuff that we wish we wouldn't do,
[2819.84 → 2824.84] and often said we'd stop doing, but it's habitual, and we can't seem to break free of it.
[2826.04 → 2831.48] You know, sometimes we feel bound by family dysfunction and the wounds that we've received from that.
[2832.54 → 2839.22] We're bound by our emotions, our struggle with anxiety or anger, bitterness,
[2839.62 → 2844.74] that we're just not able to let go of, and it's certainly not able to let go of us.
[2846.32 → 2849.28] We're bound by our materialism, right?
[2849.30 → 2855.86] Trying to fill that sense with emptiness that we have in our hearts with other things consuming.
[2857.98 → 2861.32] We're bound up trying to earn the approval of others.
[2861.64 → 2867.44] Whether it's our parents or our peers or children or spouse.
[2868.98 → 2875.14] We're bound up by our self-righteousness and our pride and our arrogance.
[2875.14 → 2879.78] And just like that whale, we're bound up in all these different ways.
[2879.98 → 2882.50] We're entangled, we're wounded, we're bleeding.
[2884.08 → 2887.90] And Jesus comes to us in our distress.
[2888.58 → 2890.44] He comes to us in our helplessness.
[2891.36 → 2897.50] And we experience Jesus cutting those bonds and setting us free.
[2897.50 → 2901.22] And friends, this is what Jesus came to do.
[2901.84 → 2904.40] He came to bring deep healing.
[2905.10 → 2906.42] He came to bring freedom.
[2907.38 → 2908.54] The world is broken.
[2908.94 → 2911.44] And the King has come.
[2911.90 → 2915.16] And he has come to mend it and to set it right again.
[2915.16 → 2918.30] And so today, friends, we turn to Jesus.
[2918.90 → 2921.66] He is the very person of God incarnate.
[2922.44 → 2928.74] And there are three things about Jesus as the healer that we see, I believe, in this passage.
[2929.00 → 2933.58] So this morning, I want us to see how, see first the character of the healer.
[2934.40 → 2936.90] And then the compassion of the healer.
[2936.96 → 2939.50] And then finally, the community of the healer.
[2939.50 → 2943.88] So first, first, the character of the healer.
[2944.62 → 2948.50] So in this text, we have three sets of miracles.
[2949.50 → 2951.14] We have the healing of the leper.
[2951.58 → 2953.96] We have the healing of the Roman centurion.
[2954.58 → 2956.72] And then the healing of Peter's mother-in-law.
[2958.70 → 2961.08] And I just want us to stop and think for a moment.
[2962.06 → 2964.08] What are miracles for?
[2965.88 → 2967.56] What are miracles for?
[2967.56 → 2970.48] What's the point of Jesus healing?
[2970.58 → 2973.30] I mean, aside from his compassion, wanting to heal them.
[2974.16 → 2974.28] Right?
[2974.34 → 2976.48] Is Jesus just showing off a bit?
[2976.80 → 2978.04] Showing off what he can do?
[2979.38 → 2981.70] And the answer is, well, no.
[2981.82 → 2983.10] He's not just showing off.
[2983.18 → 2984.20] Actually, there's a point.
[2984.32 → 2987.02] There's a purpose to the miracles.
[2987.14 → 2991.66] And one of the purposes of Jesus' miracles is to show us his character.
[2992.76 → 2996.16] Miracles reveal who Jesus actually is.
[2996.16 → 3000.32] They reveal who this heavenly king is and what he is all about.
[3001.12 → 3007.28] So we see a few things about the character of the king here in this passage through these miracles that he does.
[3007.60 → 3011.18] First, he is the author of life.
[3011.44 → 3011.56] Okay?
[3011.56 → 3012.54] He is the author of life.
[3012.54 → 3016.38] And we see this in verses 1 through 4 with the healing of the leper.
[3017.18 → 3027.82] Now, if you know your Bibles pretty well, and you read the Gospels, you sometimes see these stories, these characters that come on the scene, and they are lepers.
[3027.82 → 3027.94] And they are lepers.
[3028.62 → 3031.38] Lepers was an incurable disease at that time.
[3032.04 → 3033.86] And it was a horrible disease.
[3034.50 → 3037.94] As soon as a person showed signs of leprosy, they were banished.
[3038.56 → 3040.74] Leprosy meant that they were separated from their families.
[3041.04 → 3042.26] They were outside the city.
[3042.50 → 3044.06] And it was a living death.
[3044.06 → 3053.52] And so this man comes to Jesus, and the man says, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.
[3054.40 → 3058.10] And Jesus says, I am willing.
[3058.76 → 3059.92] Be clean.
[3061.30 → 3066.82] And notice in particular what it says, if you have your Bibles, about how Jesus healed him.
[3066.82 → 3073.04] Verse 3 says, Jesus reached out his hand and touched him.
[3074.24 → 3075.24] And touched him.
[3075.68 → 3077.22] That was unthinkable.
[3077.92 → 3078.06] Right?
[3078.12 → 3082.32] If you were to touch a man who had leprosy, you'd likely, you're going to get infected.
[3082.60 → 3083.42] That's what people thought.
[3083.88 → 3085.12] You know, it's a skin disease.
[3085.82 → 3091.00] And not only that, but if you touched a leper, you became ceremonially unclean.
[3092.08 → 3096.54] You would be cut off from the worship of God.
[3096.82 → 3098.22] But Jesus reaches out.
[3098.96 → 3101.50] He doesn't care about all of that.
[3101.72 → 3104.66] He reaches out, and he touches the man.
[3105.96 → 3109.66] And so the point of the miracle here is that Jesus is the author of life.
[3110.08 → 3111.46] He is pure.
[3112.20 → 3115.02] And he is the one who purifies.
[3115.86 → 3116.02] Right?
[3116.24 → 3117.80] His touch purifies.
[3117.80 → 3127.00] And so when Jesus reaches out his man, and he touches the leper, he's not afraid that the leper's sickness is going to be transferred onto him.
[3127.52 → 3128.70] That's not the way it works.
[3129.12 → 3134.34] It's not that the leper's uncleanness will make Jesus unclean.
[3134.44 → 3138.98] But rather, it's Jesus' purity that will be transferred to the leper.
[3139.54 → 3139.78] Right?
[3139.78 → 3142.22] He heals his disease.
[3142.76 → 3147.26] His purity flows from Jesus to the leper.
[3148.28 → 3155.92] And that means, friends, that, you know, as we think about our own lives, as we think about our own sin, our bonds, you know, these ropes,
[3155.92 → 3160.30] Jesus is not repelled by our uncleanliness.
[3161.76 → 3169.34] He doesn't shrink back from our sin and the ugliness of it.
[3170.24 → 3171.42] He purifies.
[3171.74 → 3172.90] He comes to us.
[3173.32 → 3174.18] He touches us.
[3174.26 → 3175.26] He cleanses us.
[3175.60 → 3177.32] He heals our impurities.
[3178.82 → 3180.44] And so Jesus is the author of life.
[3180.44 → 3186.96] Well, the second thing that these miracles show us about the character of the healer is that he is the authority of God.
[3187.82 → 3190.82] And we can see this in his interaction with the centurion.
[3191.30 → 3198.44] The centurion comes to Jesus, and he says, I have a servant who is at home paralyzed.
[3199.66 → 3201.18] He is in terrible pain.
[3201.52 → 3206.72] That word servant, it probably just means a boy, a household servant boy, probably pretty young.
[3207.04 → 3208.28] This boy is at home.
[3208.38 → 3208.98] He's paralyzed.
[3208.98 → 3210.24] He's in terrible pain.
[3211.20 → 3214.80] And Jesus says, shall I come and heal him?
[3215.70 → 3216.40] He's willing.
[3217.16 → 3218.28] Shall I come and heal him?
[3218.66 → 3222.38] The centurion says, no, you don't have to come.
[3223.06 → 3226.62] I don't deserve to have you come under my roof.
[3227.54 → 3231.94] He knew that a Jew can never go into the home of a Gentile.
[3233.12 → 3234.64] But he says, only say the word.
[3236.50 → 3240.36] Say the word and my servant will be healed.
[3241.44 → 3241.70] Right?
[3241.74 → 3246.52] And this puts this heavy emphasis on Jesus just commanding it to be so.
[3247.58 → 3249.22] And you have this detail in verse 9.
[3249.76 → 3254.14] The centurion says, for I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me.
[3254.14 → 3255.80] I tell this one go and he goes.
[3256.02 → 3257.46] I say that one come and he comes.
[3258.10 → 3258.32] Right?
[3258.50 → 3260.16] I say jump, and he says how high.
[3260.40 → 3261.02] It doesn't say that.
[3261.02 → 3265.22] I say to my servant, do this and he does it.
[3265.90 → 3269.72] In other words, all I have to do is say the word, and it's done.
[3270.84 → 3276.78] But then he turns to Jesus, and he says, all you have to do is say the word, and it is done.
[3276.78 → 3285.12] The centurion says, I recognize that the whole world is under your authority.
[3285.78 → 3290.72] All you have to do is say the word and my paralyzed servant will be made well.
[3290.72 → 3295.22] So in verse 13, Jesus simply says, go.
[3295.94 → 3298.92] Let it be done just as you believed it would.
[3300.02 → 3302.70] He simply commands, let it be done.
[3304.02 → 3307.48] And this reminds us of another let it be.
[3308.66 → 3309.28] Not the Beatles.
[3309.28 → 3311.78] Genesis 1, right?
[3312.20 → 3314.34] Let there be light.
[3315.20 → 3315.70] And what?
[3316.78 → 3317.80] And there was light.
[3318.34 → 3320.94] Let there be vegetation on the earth.
[3321.14 → 3322.90] And there was.
[3323.84 → 3330.66] So you see the point here that Matthew is trying to draw our attention to is that Jesus is not simply giving good wishes.
[3330.66 → 3330.88] Right?
[3330.94 → 3332.90] He's not just like, yeah, go.
[3333.02 → 3335.22] I hope your servant is well.
[3335.54 → 3337.36] You know, my best wishes to you.
[3337.36 → 3339.74] No, he's giving a divine command.
[3340.52 → 3344.64] Let it be done according to as you believe.
[3344.80 → 3349.98] This is the very same authority that made the heavens and the earth, that upholds all things.
[3350.22 → 3352.86] Just by a word, he heals.
[3352.98 → 3353.50] He commands.
[3353.80 → 3355.08] He has the authority of God.
[3356.58 → 3360.96] So these miracles that we see here, they show us that Jesus is the author of life.
[3361.14 → 3362.18] He does purify.
[3362.80 → 3364.46] That he has the authority of God.
[3364.46 → 3366.68] He commands, and it is done.
[3367.42 → 3372.44] And then lastly, we see here how these miracles show us that he is the anointed king.
[3373.20 → 3374.54] Jesus is the anointed king.
[3374.84 → 3377.06] And this is what happened with kings.
[3377.76 → 3387.42] In the Old Testament, the king would be anointed with oil on their heads, set apart, and God's spirit would come upon them.
[3387.42 → 3388.16] Right?
[3388.22 → 3396.66] The anointing of oil was a symbol of the Holy Spirit coming upon the king, setting this king apart for the task of ruling as king.
[3396.90 → 3400.24] The task of leading God's people, of protecting them.
[3401.18 → 3406.52] And so the Jews, they've had a history of kings, some good, some not so good.
[3406.52 → 3412.30] And they were expecting a descendant of King David who would come onto the throne.
[3413.56 → 3418.20] Well, Matthew says, Jesus is the son of David.
[3419.08 → 3422.10] And in fact, Matthew says, he is the Messiah.
[3422.46 → 3423.86] He is the anointed king.
[3424.66 → 3431.44] So Jesus' healing ministry is a fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah about the coming king.
[3431.44 → 3444.28] And then in verse 17 in our passage, he quotes Isaiah 53, which is talking about this Messiah, the servant of the Lord, who would come.
[3445.04 → 3452.34] Verse 17 says this, this was to fulfill, like all of these miracles, was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah.
[3453.18 → 3457.22] He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.
[3457.22 → 3462.40] In the Lord of the Rings, who is the king?
[3464.70 → 3465.52] Aragorn, I heard it.
[3465.58 → 3466.14] I heard one person.
[3466.86 → 3467.80] Aragorn is the king.
[3468.64 → 3471.56] He is the true and rightful king, right?
[3472.10 → 3474.10] But it's not obvious to everyone.
[3474.20 → 3475.42] He's living in disguise.
[3475.64 → 3477.62] He's trying to keep his head down.
[3478.26 → 3483.08] But it's in the third book, The Return of the King, that he goes into the house of healing.
[3483.08 → 3490.30] And even though he's in disguise, he makes a medicine of herbs, and he's applying it to his wounded soldiers.
[3491.26 → 3498.60] And even though these soldiers were on the verge of death, essentially on their deathbeds, they're becoming well.
[3499.64 → 3503.76] And the oldest woman there says this.
[3503.76 → 3510.82] She says, the hands of a king are the hands of a healer.
[3511.40 → 3514.58] And so shall the rightful king be known.
[3516.14 → 3517.92] He's completely disguised.
[3518.28 → 3521.90] But she knows that he is the king.
[3522.22 → 3523.30] That's the king right there.
[3523.30 → 3526.72] Because it's the king who comes with healing in his hands.
[3527.62 → 3531.44] This is very similar to what happens a bit later in the book of Matthew.
[3531.44 → 3534.86] John the Baptist, he was in prison.
[3535.02 → 3539.20] He heard about all of these miracles that Jesus was doing.
[3539.38 → 3541.62] All these miraculous deeds that Jesus was doing.
[3542.58 → 3545.94] So he sent some of his disciples to go to Jesus and to ask,
[3546.12 → 3548.66] Are you the one who is to come?
[3549.50 → 3551.74] Or should we expect someone else?
[3552.04 → 3553.40] Are you the one who is to come?
[3553.48 → 3555.26] Are you the Messiah?
[3555.26 → 3561.16] And in Matthew 11, chapter 11, verse 4, Jesus says this.
[3562.48 → 3564.82] Go back and report to John what you hear and see.
[3565.70 → 3567.50] The blind receive sight.
[3568.56 → 3569.84] The lame walk.
[3570.78 → 3572.56] Those who have leprosy are cleansed.
[3573.20 → 3574.14] The deaf hear.
[3574.60 → 3575.78] The dead are raised.
[3576.20 → 3578.38] And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
[3578.38 → 3587.28] In other words, Jesus' healing ministry gave proof that he is the long-awaited Messiah.
[3587.74 → 3589.52] And that the time of salvation has come.
[3590.20 → 3593.64] So Jesus proves he's the true king by coming to heal.
[3594.18 → 3595.12] But friends, more than that.
[3595.18 → 3596.16] He didn't just come to heal.
[3596.94 → 3598.52] But it's how he heals.
[3598.98 → 3599.70] How he heals.
[3600.10 → 3604.10] Isaiah says the king would come and that he would take up our infirmities.
[3604.28 → 3605.60] That he would bear our diseases.
[3605.60 → 3607.10] But how does he do that?
[3608.20 → 3611.52] How does Jesus as king come and heal us?
[3611.66 → 3612.88] Bear our infirmities?
[3616.38 → 3617.48] As you read your Bible.
[3617.66 → 3620.64] So this is kind of like a Bible reading insight.
[3621.76 → 3622.80] As you read your Bibles.
[3622.88 → 3626.80] You know, we read like in this passage a quote from the Old Testament, right?
[3627.70 → 3628.98] We see that in verse 17.
[3629.10 → 3629.80] It's this little quote.
[3629.90 → 3630.84] It's this little snippet.
[3630.84 → 3639.62] Now what they're doing here is they're not just quoting that little bit and just running with it and ignoring everything else that was happening in the Old Testament.
[3639.96 → 3642.80] What they're doing is actually they're quoting a little snippet.
[3643.18 → 3647.40] And it's shorthand for what's happening in the entire passage.
[3647.40 → 3653.36] And so in verse 17 it says he bears our iniquities.
[3653.90 → 3654.94] You know, whatever it says.
[3655.08 → 3655.96] That little bit.
[3656.52 → 3658.46] But Matthew is writing to a Jewish audience.
[3658.58 → 3662.16] He knows that in their minds they're just going to keep, they know the passage.
[3662.88 → 3663.88] So it's shorthand.
[3664.80 → 3669.16] So I'm going to read a few more verses from Isaiah 53.
[3669.16 → 3671.22] This is what it says.
[3693.32 → 3695.82] See, ultimately, how does Jesus heal us?
[3696.90 → 3698.58] He heals us by dying on the cross.
[3699.50 → 3702.20] His death on the cross is how he heals us.
[3702.36 → 3707.36] Not only from our sickness, but also from our sin, from our straying away from the Lord.
[3708.86 → 3711.00] And so that's, friend, that's the character of the healer.
[3711.22 → 3712.56] He is the author of life.
[3712.88 → 3714.22] He is the authority of God.
[3714.34 → 3717.94] And he is the anointed king that came to heal his people.
[3720.40 → 3724.50] But secondly, that leads us to the next point in this passage that we see here.
[3724.50 → 3729.06] Not only do we see the character of the healer, but also his compassion.
[3729.16 → 3731.18] The compassion of the healer.
[3731.64 → 3734.72] I mean, it is wonder enough that Jesus comes and heals.
[3734.80 → 3736.34] He does all these miraculous things.
[3736.68 → 3737.36] It's amazing.
[3738.36 → 3741.08] But who does Jesus heal?
[3741.58 → 3743.10] That's even more astounding.
[3744.52 → 3749.98] Who Jesus heals shows the kinds of people that Jesus is gathering into his kingdom.
[3749.98 → 3754.24] So first, Jesus has compassion on the outcasts.
[3754.94 → 3756.48] He heals the leper.
[3756.72 → 3759.90] The lepers were social outcasts, right?
[3760.06 → 3763.52] And this leper, because of his disease, he had to live outside the city.
[3764.20 → 3765.96] He couldn't be around his family.
[3766.84 → 3768.74] He couldn't shake hands with anyone.
[3769.16 → 3771.20] He couldn't go to the market to buy anything.
[3771.20 → 3778.06] And if you read the Leviticus law, it says whenever a leper walked through the camp, he had to shout what?
[3779.48 → 3779.96] Unclean!
[3780.58 → 3781.06] Unclean!
[3781.14 → 3783.96] And it's like this warning, like, I'm coming through.
[3784.16 → 3784.94] Stay back.
[3785.60 → 3787.02] I don't want you to get this.
[3787.02 → 3793.02] But not only were they social outcasts, they were religious outcasts.
[3793.72 → 3795.68] This leper was ceremonially unclean.
[3796.66 → 3798.46] Lepers were considered to have leprosy.
[3798.58 → 3798.74] Why?
[3800.14 → 3802.02] Because they were cursed by God.
[3803.20 → 3804.80] God didn't smile on them.
[3806.16 → 3810.72] In fact, to this leper's mind, God despised him.
[3810.72 → 3820.80] But this leper approaches Jesus, not because he has anything to offer him, but because he is in desperate need.
[3821.88 → 3823.00] And Jesus heals him.
[3823.64 → 3827.00] And not only that, but he is brought back to worship.
[3827.74 → 3834.86] That's the point of him going and showing to the priest that he is cleansed so that he can be welcomed back into the house of God.
[3836.16 → 3837.62] So that's who Jesus heals.
[3837.62 → 3840.18] He heals the outcasts of society.
[3840.96 → 3842.54] Who else does Jesus heal?
[3843.34 → 3844.60] He heals the outsiders.
[3845.70 → 3847.20] In verse 5, we have the centurion.
[3847.78 → 3849.00] He's coming to Jesus.
[3849.64 → 3850.52] Who is the centurion?
[3851.28 → 3851.92] A Gentile.
[3853.72 → 3856.14] That already makes him an outsider.
[3856.28 → 3856.98] He is a Gentile.
[3857.94 → 3864.46] But not only that, for the average Jew, the centurion represents Roman oppression.
[3865.56 → 3866.12] Right?
[3866.12 → 3869.82] You want to talk about the people you hate the most.
[3869.82 → 3872.96] For the Jews, it is the Roman oppressors.
[3873.16 → 3877.88] Who have, in recent generations, likely killed many of their grandparents.
[3877.88 → 3880.92] Who have done horrible things.
[3882.18 → 3889.50] Who now go around with their swords, taking their money, and crushing them in all sorts of ways.
[3890.22 → 3894.36] That would be like Jesus going into occupied France in World War II and healing a Nazi.
[3895.08 → 3896.42] The occupying enemy.
[3896.42 → 3900.34] Not real popular in Jesus' day.
[3900.56 → 3901.98] Not real popular in our day.
[3902.78 → 3907.34] But this Roman centurion comes to Jesus in need.
[3907.34 → 3910.24] And we see that he's a compassionate man.
[3910.30 → 3911.32] He cares about his servant.
[3911.94 → 3914.74] And he actually comes with great humility.
[3914.92 → 3918.30] He says, I do not deserve what I'm asking you to do.
[3918.48 → 3919.16] He knows that.
[3919.46 → 3920.58] I know who I am.
[3920.84 → 3921.76] I know what I am.
[3922.36 → 3923.62] I don't deserve this.
[3924.06 → 3926.06] But he comes in great faith.
[3926.96 → 3931.62] And this man who is an outsider, Jesus welcomes in.
[3931.62 → 3934.96] So Jesus heals the outcasts.
[3935.00 → 3936.16] He heals the outsiders.
[3936.98 → 3938.40] And who else does Jesus heal?
[3939.02 → 3941.36] He also heals the obscure.
[3942.10 → 3943.86] Because we have to find something that goes with O.
[3944.08 → 3944.84] So obscure.
[3945.60 → 3950.20] The people who don't really have that much public importance.
[3951.18 → 3955.68] And we see this in verse 14 with the healing of Jesus' Peter's mother-in-law.
[3956.84 → 3957.78] He heals a woman.
[3958.78 → 3961.34] Women always had a lesser status in the ancient world.
[3961.62 → 3963.52] They had none of the privileges given to men.
[3964.66 → 3969.86] And then also, not only does he heal Peter's mother-in-law, but look at verse 16.
[3970.96 → 3972.28] He heals the many.
[3973.02 → 3973.72] It's evening.
[3974.16 → 3975.22] It's the end of a long day.
[3975.30 → 3976.30] They're coming in the night.
[3977.50 → 3980.32] Many who were demon-possessed were brought to him.
[3980.94 → 3982.96] He drove out the spirits with a word.
[3983.52 → 3986.26] He healed all the sick.
[3987.88 → 3989.86] Who were these many?
[3989.86 → 3989.98] Many.
[3990.74 → 3991.62] We don't know.
[3993.68 → 3995.60] They are just the people.
[3995.72 → 3996.70] The obscure people.
[3998.12 → 4001.04] You know, and for most of us, we find ourselves among the many.
[4002.36 → 4005.40] They come because they need Jesus to heal them.
[4005.40 → 4008.34] And you know what's clear in this passage?
[4008.88 → 4013.46] As we look at all these people Jesus heals, he heals the outcasts.
[4013.54 → 4014.78] He heals the outsiders.
[4015.00 → 4015.98] He heals the obscure.
[4015.98 → 4023.30] It is they who are more likely to come to Jesus than whom?
[4024.52 → 4025.86] Than the people who are well.
[4026.70 → 4033.14] Than the wealthy, the important, the social insiders, the religious insiders.
[4034.26 → 4034.48] Right?
[4034.56 → 4035.62] And didn't Jesus say that?
[4035.72 → 4037.96] He said, I am the physician who comes to heal who?
[4039.22 → 4039.78] The sick.
[4039.78 → 4044.14] To people who think they're healthy, Jesus is optional.
[4044.72 → 4049.84] But when people have made such a mess of their lives or when life has made such a mess of them,
[4050.84 → 4050.98] right?
[4050.98 → 4057.94] When life is just not working, those are the people who are drawn to Jesus and drawn into his kingdom.
[4059.08 → 4059.30] Right?
[4059.30 → 4064.22] It's the outsiders who come and say, if you are willing, Jesus, you can make me clean.
[4065.38 → 4065.60] Right?
[4065.62 → 4070.82] And if you think that you're healthy, right, then what need do you have of a doctor?
[4071.62 → 4079.78] If you think you are pretty good, that God likes you because of who you are, then you don't have a need of what?
[4080.64 → 4081.18] A saviour.
[4083.52 → 4085.24] That's for the sinner.
[4086.28 → 4088.20] Being, you know, a doctor is for the sick.
[4088.20 → 4097.78] And that's why it's often people you might not otherwise expect to be in the kingdom of God who are the people that Jesus comes to heal.
[4099.36 → 4103.94] You know, Jesus is not put off by our mess.
[4105.00 → 4105.20] Right?
[4105.24 → 4111.98] Whatever mess you've made, whatever mess you're entangled in, he is not put off.
[4112.64 → 4113.74] He's compassionate.
[4114.02 → 4115.12] He's willing to heal you.
[4115.12 → 4118.44] And so that leads us to our third point this morning.
[4118.62 → 4124.44] We've talked about the character of the healer, the compassion of the healer, and then lastly, just the community of the healer.
[4124.74 → 4129.10] And we see this in verse 15 with the healing of Peter's mother-in-law.
[4129.58 → 4131.12] So notice what is her response.
[4131.80 → 4133.12] What's her response to the healing?
[4134.16 → 4136.28] So this is what it says in verse 15.
[4136.28 → 4139.44] Jesus, he touched her.
[4140.32 → 4141.20] The fever left her.
[4141.94 → 4144.58] She got up and began to serve him.
[4146.24 → 4147.30] Jesus healed her.
[4147.86 → 4149.00] And she rose.
[4149.54 → 4150.70] And she began to serve him.
[4150.84 → 4150.98] Right?
[4151.12 → 4152.38] He didn't ask her to.
[4153.84 → 4155.44] She didn't have to.
[4155.58 → 4157.90] She could have just probably rested in bed.
[4157.98 → 4159.60] Everyone would have been just fine with that.
[4159.60 → 4163.18] But she gets up, and she serves with a glad heart.
[4163.26 → 4165.24] This is a response of gratitude.
[4166.16 → 4169.52] And that is how, friends, that Jesus intends to spread his kingdom.
[4169.70 → 4171.98] By healing his people for service.
[4172.80 → 4172.90] Right?
[4173.00 → 4178.84] Jesus intends to grow his heavenly kingdom by creating a community of servant-hearted people
[4178.84 → 4186.28] who have been healed by Jesus, redeemed by Jesus, united to their Saviour, transformed by the Spirit.
[4188.68 → 4193.28] I've been reading a book recently about the early church.
[4194.46 → 4201.50] And the early Christians in the Roman Empire, they were the outcasts of Roman society.
[4202.12 → 4204.52] Because they went against the culture.
[4204.52 → 4208.08] They started living completely different lives.
[4208.20 → 4209.24] They had different values.
[4209.36 → 4210.50] They didn't worship the gods.
[4210.58 → 4211.86] They worshipped the one true God.
[4212.18 → 4213.98] And because of that, they were despised.
[4214.94 → 4222.46] But over a period of about 300 years, Christianity went from some obscure small minority group
[4222.46 → 4230.70] who were outcasts and were in hiding to becoming, eventually, transforming the whole Roman world.
[4230.70 → 4238.84] And a lot of the change in how people perceived Christians goes back to what happened during a plague
[4238.84 → 4241.38] in the middle of the third century A.D.
[4242.72 → 4245.22] So this plague hit the Roman Empire.
[4245.38 → 4250.68] And the death toll from this plague was so rampant that about a third of the population was killed.
[4251.54 → 4257.02] And the response of most people was that anybody who could flee.
[4257.02 → 4259.60] People abandoned their families.
[4259.94 → 4260.92] They abandoned their children.
[4261.26 → 4262.30] They abandoned their parents.
[4262.52 → 4263.48] They abandoned their friends.
[4263.78 → 4267.34] They fled to the countryside to try not to catch this disease.
[4268.08 → 4271.78] And as soon as anyone in your family got sick, you'd throw them out to die.
[4274.34 → 4280.76] People, sick, dead people, filling the streets, filling the temples, filling the squares.
[4281.42 → 4282.52] No one to nurse them.
[4282.70 → 4283.80] No one to take care of them.
[4284.40 → 4285.70] It was hell.
[4285.70 → 4286.84] No one to nurse them.
[4286.84 → 4287.22] No one to nurse them.
[4287.22 → 4287.82] No one to nurse them.
[4287.82 → 4293.94] But in the midst of that, there was one group who behaved differently.
[4295.08 → 4300.34] There's a quote from Demosthenes, who was the Bishop of Alexandria at that time, and he writes this.
[4301.40 → 4302.86] First he says this,
[4302.86 → 4307.04] Alas, all is lamentation.
[4308.04 → 4309.28] Everyone in mourning.
[4310.14 → 4316.92] The city resounds with weeping because of the numbers that have died and are dying every day.
[4317.72 → 4320.54] All right, so that gives you a sense of just how horrible this plague was.
[4320.88 → 4321.68] But then he goes on.
[4321.68 → 4332.34] But most of our brother Christians showed unbounded love and loyalty, never sparing themselves and thinking only of one another.
[4332.34 → 4343.16] Heedless of the danger, they took charge of the sick, attending to their every need, ministering to them in Christ.
[4343.16 → 4348.28] And with them departed this life, serenely happy.
[4349.28 → 4358.40] For they were infected by others with the disease, drawing on themselves the sickness of their neighbours and cheerfully accepting their pains.
[4359.40 → 4367.40] Many in nursing and curing others transferred their death to themselves and died in their stead.
[4367.40 → 4374.96] When the plague struck, it was the Christians who stayed and tried to bring healing to the sick.
[4376.06 → 4378.40] And the world saw it.
[4380.20 → 4382.34] And they had never seen anything like it.
[4383.56 → 4388.16] And many people, because of that, were attracted to the beauty of Jesus.
[4389.02 → 4390.20] And it transformed the world.
[4391.56 → 4393.24] Now, where do they get that idea?
[4393.24 → 4401.44] Where do they ever get the idea to take the illness of someone else onto themselves and die in their place?
[4402.48 → 4402.62] Right?
[4402.68 → 4406.14] Nobody in the world ever had that idea until Jesus came.
[4407.08 → 4407.22] Right?
[4407.26 → 4410.88] Because Jesus is the king who came to heal.
[4411.66 → 4412.30] How do you do it?
[4412.32 → 4418.88] By taking up our infirmities, by bearing our diseases, so that through faith in him, we might be healed.
[4419.94 → 4422.26] Friends, Jesus is the healer.
[4422.26 → 4424.42] Do you know the healer?
[4424.66 → 4428.14] Are you experiencing the deep healing of Jesus?
[4429.18 → 4429.92] Let's pray.
[4433.02 → 4434.58] Come heal us, Lord Jesus.
[4435.04 → 4437.02] We come to you with all of our brokenness.
[4437.74 → 4444.34] We come to you with our shame, our struggles, our grief, our pain, our confusion.
[4444.92 → 4449.32] And we come to you because you are the compassionate healer.
[4449.42 → 4451.70] You are the authority of God.
[4453.26 → 4455.22] You are the author of life.
[4455.22 → 4458.92] You are the king who comes with healing.
[4458.92 → 4468.78] So, Lord, would you help us to experience the presence and the love and the power of your word in a way that would bring healing to our souls.
[4468.78 → 4472.90] Lord, give us the deep healing of your gospel.
[4474.74 → 4476.10] Bind up our wounds.
[4477.06 → 4482.32] Untangle the cords of death and sin that entangle us in, Lord, which you set us free.
[4483.00 → 4486.34] Set us free in Christ, we pray in his holy name.
[4486.34 → 4487.56] Amen.
[4487.56 → 4487.62] Amen.
[4489.42 → 4490.88] So, friends, let's stand.
[4491.24 → 4494.06] And our song response is called The River.
[4494.38 → 4495.70] So, let's stand and let's sing.
[4495.70 → 4503.72] The River Camera.
[4504.72 → 4506.58] The River.
[4506.58 → 4508.66] Ты
[4508.66 → 4530.98] To the river I am going
[4530.98 → 4537.32] Bring sins I cannot forget
[4537.32 → 4540.98] Come and cleanse me
[4541.54 → 4544.98] Come forgive me
[4544.98 → 4549.98] All I need to bring to them
[4550.66 → 4553.98] In these waters
[4554.64 → 4556.98] Feeling mercy
[4556.98 → 4560.98] Close with freedom
[4560.98 → 4563.98] From this plan
[4563.98 → 4566.98] I am going
[4566.98 → 4570.98] To that river
[4570.98 → 4576.98] Lord I need to meet you there
[4577.98 → 4580.98] Precious Jesus
[4580.98 → 4583.98] I am ready
[4583.98 → 4586.98] To surrender
[4586.98 → 4589.98] Every prayer
[4589.98 → 4593.98] Take my hand now
[4593.98 → 4596.98] Lead me closer
[4596.98 → 4601.98] Lord I need you there
[4601.98 → 4603.98] To the river
[4603.98 → 4614.98] To the river I am going
[4614.98 → 4620.98] Bringing sins I cannot bear
[4620.98 → 4624.98] Come and cleanse me
[4624.98 → 4626.98] Come forgive me
[4626.98 → 4627.98] Come forgive me
[4627.98 → 4630.98] Lord I need
[4630.98 → 4634.98] To meet you there
[4634.98 → 4637.98] In these waters
[4637.98 → 4640.98] Healing mercy
[4640.98 → 4641.98] Mercy
[4641.98 → 4643.98] Falls with freedom
[4643.98 → 4646.98] From this plan
[4646.98 → 4650.98] I am going
[4650.98 → 4653.98] To that river
[4653.98 → 4655.98] Lord I need
[4655.98 → 4657.98] To meet you there
[4657.98 → 4659.98] To meet you there
[4659.98 → 4660.98] To meet you there
[4660.98 → 4661.98] To meet you there
[4661.98 → 4663.98] Precious Jesus
[4663.98 → 4667.98] I am ready
[4667.98 → 4670.98] To surrender
[4670.98 → 4672.98] If we can
[4672.98 → 4673.98] Take my hand
[4673.98 → 4678.98] Take my hand now
[4678.98 → 4679.98] Lead me closer
[4679.98 → 4683.98] Lord I need you there
[4683.98 → 4685.98] Lord I need you there
[4685.98 → 4686.98] To meet you there
[4686.98 → 4695.98] Come and join us
[4695.98 → 4696.98] In the river
[4696.98 → 4697.98] Come and join us
[4697.98 → 4698.98] In the river
[4698.98 → 4700.98] Come find life
[4700.98 → 4702.98] Beyond compare
[4702.98 → 4703.98] Be beyond compare
[4703.98 → 4706.98] He is calling
[4706.98 → 4709.98] He is calling
[4709.98 → 4712.98] He is waiting
[4712.98 → 4715.98] Jesus calls
[4715.98 → 4718.98] To meet you there
[4718.98 → 4721.98] He is calling
[4721.98 → 4722.98] He is calling
[4722.98 → 4723.98] He is calling
[4723.98 → 4724.98] He is waiting
[4724.98 → 4725.98] He is waiting
[4725.98 → 4726.98] He is waiting
[4726.98 → 4728.98] Jesus calls
[4728.98 → 4732.98] To meet you there
[4732.98 → 4739.98] Jesus calls
[4739.98 → 4740.98] To meet you there
[4740.98 → 4741.98] Jesus calls
[4741.98 → 4743.98] To meet you there
[4743.98 → 4744.98] Jesus calls
[4744.98 → 4747.98] To meet you there
[4747.98 → 4748.98] He says Jesus
[4748.98 → 4749.98] I am ready
[4749.98 → 4750.98] To surrender
[4750.98 → 4751.98] every care
[4751.98 → 4753.98] Take my hand
[4753.98 → 4754.98] God
[4754.98 → 4755.98] Lead me closer
[4755.98 → 4759.98] Lord, I need to meet you there.
[4761.98 → 4767.80] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[4769.34 → 4773.88] Lord, I need to meet you there.
[4782.88 → 4783.80] Let me be seated.
[4785.98 → 4787.98] Thank you.
[4801.98 → 4806.58] Beacons, we'll come forward now to collect the offering this morning for a resonant global mission.
[4806.58 → 4808.58] Amen.
[4808.58 → 4810.58] Amen.
[4810.58 → 4812.58] Amen.
[4812.58 → 4814.58] Amen.

[4818.58 → 4820.58] Amen.
[4820.58 → 4822.58] Amen.
[4822.58 → 4826.58] Amen.
[4826.58 → 4856.56] Thank you.
[4856.58 → 4886.56] Thank you.
[4886.58 → 4916.56] Thank you.
[4916.58 → 4946.56] Thank you.
[4946.56 → 4948.56] Thank you.
[4976.56 → 4978.56] Thank you.
[4978.56 → 5008.56] 
[5008.56 → 5010.56] Thank you.
[5010.56 → 5012.56] Thank you.
[5012.56 → 5014.56] Thank you.
[5014.56 → 5016.56] Thank you.
[5016.56 → 5018.56] Thank you.
[5018.56 → 5020.56] Thank you.
[5020.56 → 5022.56] Thank you.
[5022.56 → 5024.56] Thank you.
[5024.56 → 5026.56] Thank you.
[5026.56 → 5028.56] Thank you.
[5028.56 → 5030.56] Thank you.
[5030.56 → 5032.56] Thank you.
[5032.56 → 5034.56] Thank you.
[5034.56 → 5036.56] Thank you.
[5036.56 → 5038.56] Thank you.
[5038.56 → 5040.56] Thank you.
[5040.56 → 5042.56] Thank you.
[5042.56 → 5044.56] Thank you.
[5044.56 → 5046.56] I'm not a member of the Lord.
[5046.56 → 5048.56] Thank you.
[5048.56 → 5052.56] Thank you.
[5052.56 → 5054.56] Thank you.
[5054.56 → 5056.56] Thank you.
[5056.56 → 5063.72] weak, we feel helpless, we feel we don't have the power to overcome temptation, we don't have the
[5063.72 → 5072.44] power to share your gospel, to transform lives, to transform this world. But Lord, you didn't expect
[5072.44 → 5079.54] us to because you gave us your spirit to guide us and lead us and to empower us. And so Father,
[5079.60 → 5083.66] we thank you for that spirit, that spirit that even resides within our own hearts and by which
[5083.66 → 5093.06] we can cry out, Abba, Father. The spirit that bears the fruit of the spirit in our lives to make us
[5093.06 → 5103.12] more patient and kind and loving. And Lord, the spirit that unites us to one another in the body
[5103.12 → 5110.92] of Christ. Father, we thank you for your spirit today. And Lord, we ask that your spirit would be
[5110.92 → 5117.78] with Pat Barman as she's broken her elbow, and she's been waiting for surgery and has been postponed
[5117.78 → 5123.62] time and again. It was supposed to be today and now it's tomorrow. Lord, would you be with her now
[5123.62 → 5130.66] in her pain? And Lord, would she be ready and able to have the surgery tomorrow? And Lord,
[5131.90 → 5136.22] would you through that surgery, through the hands of the doctors, bring healing to Pat?
[5136.22 → 5142.92] And Lord, today and now, would you be present with her as her comforter? Lord, we thank you for the
[5142.92 → 5149.36] good news of Jordan's. He had his surgery, I believe, on Friday. And according to the doctors,
[5149.52 → 5155.48] it was successful. And so Lord, we pray that you would help Jordan be with him, help him to recover,
[5155.98 → 5165.08] help him to adjust to life as it is right now. But Lord, always looking up to you and trusting you as
[5165.08 → 5171.80] the healer. Lord, we thank you for the healing that you have given to each one of us to various degrees
[5171.80 → 5176.98] and in different ways. And Lord, would you as the great surgeon, the great physician,
[5177.60 → 5186.60] do your work in our hearts. Lord, cut away sin, evil, and Lord, all the things that bind us.
[5187.52 → 5193.30] And Lord, give us hearts of flesh, transform us into your image, we pray. And we pray all these things
[5193.30 → 5197.86] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who taught us to pray, saying together,
[5198.60 → 5207.04] our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is
[5207.04 → 5215.04] in heaven. Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[5215.04 → 5222.68] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power
[5222.68 → 5229.62] and the glory now and forever. Amen. Brothers and sisters, please stand.
[5231.30 → 5235.82] And we will end our service today with the Lord's blessing upon us. And I invite you
[5235.82 → 5240.10] to join us for a time of fellowship, right through the doors of the fellowship hall. Make sure you
[5240.10 → 5247.52] greet and congratulate, most importantly, Jackie and Tiffany and their girls. They're usually kind of
[5247.52 → 5254.42] in the back corner by the benches, so you'll know where to find them. And so I invite you to hold out
[5254.42 → 5262.98] your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing. Hear the Most High say, I will put my spirit within you
[5262.98 → 5272.58] and you shall live. May you go from this place with an awareness of the living spirit within you. Amen.
