[0.00 --> 14.90]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 61.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 302.00]  Amen.
[330.00 --> 332.00]  Amen.
[332.00 --> 333.00]  Amen.
[333.00 --> 335.00]  Good morning.
[335.00 --> 339.00]  It is a delight to be here again.
[339.00 --> 346.30]  You may remember my name is Pastor Len Batterink and before your Pastor Jason arrived I was
[346.30 --> 352.48]  here quite often and I felt, still feel a kind of special connection to Ladner Church.
[352.48 --> 359.68]  I had just retired prior to that and it almost felt like yet another time of ministry with
[359.68 --> 360.68]  you.
[360.68 --> 367.68]  And yet Ladner's moved on and wonderful things are happening here so it's good to reconnect
[367.68 --> 368.68]  though.
[368.68 --> 371.04]  I'm going to read a call to worship.
[371.04 --> 375.58]  It comes from Paul's letter to the Philippians and this is a call to worship that's kind of
[375.58 --> 376.58]  built around a hymn.
[376.58 --> 382.56]  It seems to have been a hymn in the early, very early Christian church and that Paul kind
[382.56 --> 388.58]  of put into his letter to the Philippians and this is a hymn about Christ.
[388.58 --> 394.90]  He said he was in very nature God but did not consider equality with God something to be
[394.90 --> 397.58]  used to his own advantage.
[397.58 --> 400.58]  Rather, he made himself nothing.
[400.58 --> 407.10]  By taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in
[407.10 --> 413.58]  appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death on a
[413.58 --> 414.58]  cross.
[414.58 --> 427.58]  So today we join with that great company of people who bow before the risen, exalted Christ
[427.58 --> 428.58]  and worship him.
[428.58 --> 446.58]  Let me ask you to stand now and receive his greeting.
[446.58 --> 452.80]  People of God, grace to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
[452.80 --> 454.90]  through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[454.90 --> 456.78]  Amen.
[456.78 --> 457.78]  So that is God's greeting to you.
[457.78 --> 460.78]  Take a moment and greet each other and welcome each other to worship.
[460.78 --> 482.78]  in Green Grid and not be God of latheness.
[482.78 --> 512.12]  It's just good to sing your praises
[512.12 --> 517.50]  And to thank you, O Most High
[517.50 --> 522.94]  Showing forth your loving kindness
[522.94 --> 528.86]  Where the morning lights the sky
[528.86 --> 534.90]  It is good when night is falling
[534.90 --> 540.36]  Of your faithfulness to town
[540.36 --> 546.14]  While with sweet melodious praises
[546.14 --> 552.36]  Songs of adoration sound
[552.36 --> 560.14]  You have filled my heart with gladness
[560.14 --> 566.42]  Through the works your hands have wrought
[566.42 --> 572.20]  You have made my life victorious
[572.20 --> 577.98]  Break your words and deep your thought
[577.98 --> 583.98]  You, O Lord, are I exalted
[583.98 --> 589.98]  Rain forevermore in light
[589.98 --> 595.76]  All your enemies shall perish
[595.76 --> 601.98]  Sin be banished from your sight
[601.98 --> 611.04]  But the good shall live before you
[611.04 --> 616.72]  Planted in your dwelling place
[616.72 --> 621.76]  Fruitful trees and ever verdant
[621.76 --> 627.54]  Nourished by your boundless grace
[627.54 --> 634.84]  In his goodness to the righteous
[634.84 --> 639.54]  God his righteousness displays
[639.54 --> 645.32]  God my God my strength and refuge
[645.32 --> 653.32]  Just and true are all your ways
[653.32 --> 657.10]  You're the word of God the Father
[657.10 --> 681.88]  You're the word of God the Father
[681.88 --> 686.66]  From before the world began
[686.66 --> 690.66]  Every star and every planet
[690.66 --> 695.62]  Has been fashioned by your hand
[695.62 --> 699.26]  All creation holds together
[699.26 --> 704.32]  By the power of your voice
[704.32 --> 713.10]  Let the stars trabal, let the stars
[713.10 --> 713.72]  Let the stars and標準 voices
[713.72 --> 718.12]  Let the stars declare your glory
[718.12 --> 720.10]  Let the stars and dotになります
[720.10 --> 725.42]  Let the stars and dunce shades rejoice
[725.42 --> 725.72]  You're the author of creation
[725.72 --> 727.30]  You're the Lord of everyone
[727.30 --> 729.20]  the lands.
[731.90 --> 733.24]  Yet you left
[733.24 --> 735.90]  the gaze of angels,
[736.40 --> 737.68]  came to seek
[737.68 --> 740.24]  and save the lost,
[740.72 --> 742.10]  and exchanged
[742.10 --> 744.34]  the joy of heaven
[744.34 --> 745.78]  for the
[745.78 --> 747.76]  anguish of our
[747.76 --> 749.00]  cross.
[749.00 --> 750.68]  With the prayer
[750.68 --> 752.78]  you fed the hungry,
[753.54 --> 755.08]  with the word
[755.08 --> 757.00]  you calmed the sea.
[757.90 --> 759.74]  Yet how silently
[759.74 --> 761.24]  you suffered
[761.24 --> 763.62]  that the guilty
[763.62 --> 765.56]  may go free.
[766.74 --> 768.28]  You're the author
[768.28 --> 769.90]  of creation,
[771.06 --> 772.50]  you're the Lord
[772.50 --> 774.14]  of everyone,
[775.36 --> 776.80]  and your cry
[776.80 --> 778.70]  of love rings out
[778.70 --> 781.98]  across the land.
[784.96 --> 786.34]  With the shadows
[786.34 --> 788.50]  who rose victorious,
[789.50 --> 790.28]  rest in victory
[790.28 --> 793.56]  from the grave,
[793.94 --> 795.28]  and ascended
[795.28 --> 797.28]  into heaven,
[798.22 --> 799.28]  leaving captives
[799.90 --> 801.28]  in your way.
[801.78 --> 803.28]  Now you stand
[803.94 --> 806.28]  before the Father,
[807.02 --> 807.28]  interceding
[808.56 --> 810.28]  for your own.
[810.28 --> 812.72]  from each tribe
[812.72 --> 813.72]  and town
[813.72 --> 814.60]  and nation,
[814.60 --> 816.48]  you are
[816.48 --> 818.56]  leading sinners
[818.56 --> 820.02]  home.
[820.38 --> 821.84]  You're the author
[821.84 --> 823.60]  of creation,
[824.72 --> 826.06]  you're the Lord
[826.06 --> 827.60]  of everyone,
[829.08 --> 830.54]  and your cry
[830.54 --> 832.46]  of love rings out
[832.46 --> 835.22]  across the land.
[835.22 --> 835.78]  of heaven.
[837.66 --> 838.70]  Please be seated.
[844.76 --> 845.74]  Isaiah 40.
[846.46 --> 847.34]  This is such
[847.34 --> 848.60]  a well-known passage
[848.60 --> 849.34]  in the Bible,
[849.34 --> 850.88]  you will recognize
[850.88 --> 851.66]  these words.
[852.54 --> 853.66]  Comfort, comfort
[853.66 --> 854.42]  my people,
[854.62 --> 855.62]  says your God.
[856.44 --> 857.52]  Speak tenderly
[857.52 --> 858.46]  to Jerusalem
[858.46 --> 859.86]  and proclaim
[859.86 --> 860.54]  to her
[860.54 --> 861.54]  that her hard
[861.54 --> 862.02]  service
[862.02 --> 863.22]  has been completed,
[863.62 --> 864.80]  that her sin
[864.80 --> 865.84]  has been paid for.
[866.56 --> 867.38]  A voice
[867.38 --> 868.40]  of one calling,
[869.08 --> 869.90]  in the wilderness
[869.90 --> 870.74]  prepare
[870.74 --> 871.36]  the way
[871.36 --> 871.92]  of the Lord.
[872.80 --> 873.54]  Make straight
[873.54 --> 874.28]  in the desert
[874.28 --> 875.08]  a highway
[875.08 --> 875.98]  for the Lord.
[876.98 --> 877.80]  The glory
[877.80 --> 878.56]  of the Lord
[878.56 --> 879.62]  will be revealed
[879.62 --> 881.08]  and all people
[881.08 --> 882.34]  will see it together.
[883.06 --> 883.84]  For the mouth
[883.84 --> 884.62]  of the Lord
[884.62 --> 885.64]  has spoken it.
[885.64 --> 887.62]  Who has measured
[887.62 --> 888.34]  the waters
[888.34 --> 889.14]  in the hollow
[889.14 --> 889.98]  of his hand?
[890.70 --> 891.06]  Or,
[891.38 --> 892.22]  with the width
[892.22 --> 892.96]  of his hand
[892.96 --> 893.78]  marked off
[893.78 --> 894.36]  the heavens?
[895.08 --> 896.18]  Who has held
[896.18 --> 896.76]  the dust
[896.76 --> 897.50]  of the earth
[897.50 --> 898.32]  in a basket?
[898.92 --> 899.54]  Or weighed
[899.54 --> 900.14]  the mountains
[900.14 --> 901.10]  on the scales?
[901.98 --> 903.14]  Who can fathom
[903.14 --> 903.72]  the spirit
[903.72 --> 904.36]  of the Lord
[904.36 --> 905.60]  or instruct
[905.60 --> 906.14]  the Lord
[906.14 --> 907.16]  as his counselor?
[908.44 --> 909.24]  With whom,
[909.38 --> 909.58]  then,
[909.64 --> 910.30]  will you compare
[910.30 --> 910.68]  God?
[911.40 --> 912.04]  Or who is
[912.04 --> 912.60]  my equal,
[912.96 --> 913.86]  says the Holy One?
[915.00 --> 915.48]  Lift up
[915.48 --> 915.96]  your eyes
[915.96 --> 916.26]  and look
[916.26 --> 916.88]  to the heavens.
[917.38 --> 918.00]  Who created
[918.00 --> 918.62]  all these?
[919.60 --> 920.14]  The Lord
[920.14 --> 920.96]  is the everlasting
[920.96 --> 921.44]  God,
[922.26 --> 922.78]  the creator
[922.78 --> 923.62]  of the ends
[923.62 --> 924.42]  of the earth.
[925.36 --> 926.12]  He gives strength
[926.12 --> 926.74]  to the weary
[926.74 --> 928.02]  and increases
[928.02 --> 928.64]  the power
[928.64 --> 929.18]  of the weak.
[930.40 --> 931.24]  Those who hope
[931.24 --> 931.76]  in the Lord
[931.76 --> 932.42]  will renew
[932.42 --> 933.10]  their strength.
[933.30 --> 933.96]  They will soar
[933.96 --> 934.44]  on wings
[934.44 --> 935.24]  like eagles.
[936.72 --> 937.96]  It was Isaiah 40
[937.96 --> 938.60]  which formed
[938.60 --> 939.22]  the inspiration
[939.22 --> 940.22]  for our next song,
[940.98 --> 942.32]  Behold Our God.
[945.48 --> 961.98]  Who has held
[961.98 --> 963.34]  the oceans
[963.34 --> 965.10]  in his hands?
[965.46 --> 967.68]  Who has conquered
[967.68 --> 970.72]  every grain of sand?
[970.72 --> 983.52]  Kings and nations tremble at his voice, all creation rises to rejoice.
[984.24 --> 995.38]  Behold our God, seated on his throne, come let us adore him.
[995.38 --> 1009.34]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore him.
[1011.04 --> 1022.32]  Who has given counsel to the Lord? Who can question any of his words?
[1022.32 --> 1028.20]  Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[1028.72 --> 1035.32]  Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?
[1035.98 --> 1047.38]  Behold our God, seated on his throne, come let us adore him.
[1047.38 --> 1060.38]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore him.
[1060.38 --> 1074.66]  Who has felt the knees upon his hands, bearing all the guilt of sinful men.
[1074.66 --> 1087.86]  God eternal, humble to the grave, Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign.
[1087.86 --> 1100.10]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore him.
[1100.10 --> 1113.86]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore him.
[1113.86 --> 1123.24]  I'm going to read another piece from the letters of Paul.
[1123.36 --> 1124.82]  This is from the book of Romans.
[1125.56 --> 1129.10]  And this is one of those pivot points in the book.
[1129.74 --> 1135.62]  People have sometimes noticed that if you take out chapters 9 to 11,
[1135.62 --> 1141.88]  then the rest of that book kind of lines up like our Heidelberg Catechism with those three parts.
[1142.12 --> 1148.34]  Sin, our sin and misery, then our forgiveness, grace and Christ, and then a life of gratitude.
[1148.60 --> 1150.62]  And the book of Romans kind of sets that up.
[1151.06 --> 1158.88]  And the reading here will kind of be at that point where we're moving from the sin and misery into the grace of God.
[1158.88 --> 1161.82]  And here's how that first part ends.
[1162.02 --> 1167.40]  Paul quotes a whole series of passages out of the Old Testament and says,
[1167.56 --> 1169.76]  There is no one righteous, not even one.
[1170.18 --> 1171.74]  There is no one who understands.
[1171.86 --> 1173.42]  There is no one who seeks God.
[1173.90 --> 1175.38]  All have turned away.
[1175.88 --> 1177.24]  They have together become worthless.
[1177.48 --> 1179.66]  There is no one who does good, not even one.
[1180.46 --> 1182.04]  Their throats are open graves.
[1182.12 --> 1183.62]  Their tongues practice deceit.
[1183.70 --> 1185.66]  The poison of vipers is on their lips.
[1186.18 --> 1188.32]  Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
[1188.32 --> 1190.96]  Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[1191.62 --> 1193.84]  Ruin and misery mark their ways.
[1194.30 --> 1197.22]  And the way of peace they do not know.
[1197.36 --> 1200.98]  There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[1201.02 --> 1205.02]  This is a very dark judgment on the human condition.
[1205.62 --> 1209.80]  And then it's like the light breaks.
[1210.76 --> 1213.58]  But now, apart from the law,
[1213.58 --> 1217.94]  the righteousness of God has been made known,
[1218.08 --> 1220.70]  to which the law and prophets testify.
[1221.50 --> 1228.48]  This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.
[1228.62 --> 1231.12]  There is no difference between Jew and Greek,
[1231.18 --> 1234.38]  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[1234.38 --> 1243.26]  and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came in Christ Jesus.
[1243.42 --> 1252.06]  God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement to be received by faith.
[1252.06 --> 1255.28]  So here is both our confession,
[1256.18 --> 1259.94]  our deep problem before God,
[1260.02 --> 1262.00]  that we stand as guilty sinners,
[1262.58 --> 1265.26]  and he answered by his grace,
[1265.58 --> 1268.98]  his pure, undeserved love to us.
[1269.52 --> 1272.36]  By grace, as Paul would say to the Ephesians,
[1272.48 --> 1275.46]  by grace you are saved through faith.
[1275.62 --> 1277.16]  This is not your own doing.
[1277.74 --> 1280.22]  This is a gift from God.
[1280.22 --> 1282.00]  Join me in prayer.
[1283.14 --> 1285.04]  Oh Lord, we come here each week,
[1285.20 --> 1287.24]  or come here occasionally,
[1287.24 --> 1291.02]  with our own woundedness and our own frailties,
[1291.60 --> 1292.86]  our own mistakes,
[1293.72 --> 1295.42]  our own wrongs,
[1295.90 --> 1299.66]  the things we have said we'd wish you hadn't said,
[1299.72 --> 1301.76]  the things we've done and should not have done,
[1301.86 --> 1303.96]  the things we should have done but didn't do,
[1304.04 --> 1306.44]  or things we should have said but didn't say.
[1306.52 --> 1309.42]  Oh Lord, we stand before you in this place,
[1309.42 --> 1313.16]  as people who we are guilty,
[1313.94 --> 1319.32]  and yet you answer us with this pure, undeserved love.
[1319.90 --> 1321.94]  You receive us, you pardon us,
[1322.02 --> 1324.92]  and in Christ you make us new.
[1325.12 --> 1329.06]  And so we can stand here and be unashamed and be unafraid,
[1329.84 --> 1332.56]  because in Christ we are set free.
[1332.56 --> 1336.50]  We give you praise, dear Lord, in Jesus' name.
[1336.88 --> 1337.26]  Amen.
[1338.84 --> 1340.82]  Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
[1340.82 --> 1361.24]  Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
[1361.24 --> 1366.94]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[1367.44 --> 1372.66]  Let the water and the blood
[1372.66 --> 1378.24]  From thy wounded side which flowed
[1379.44 --> 1384.52]  Be absent, the double cure
[1384.52 --> 1390.90]  Safe from guilt and made me pure
[1390.90 --> 1398.38]  Not the labors of my hands
[1398.38 --> 1403.04]  Can fulfill thy lost immense
[1403.04 --> 1409.52]  Could my seal no longer know
[1409.52 --> 1414.98]  Could my tears forever flow
[1414.98 --> 1421.58]  All for sin could not atone
[1421.58 --> 1427.62]  Thou art saved and thou alone
[1427.62 --> 1435.52]  Nothing in my hand I bring
[1435.52 --> 1441.48]  Simply to the cross I cling
[1441.48 --> 1447.78]  May God come to thee for dress
[1447.78 --> 1453.64]  Thou blessed look to thee for grace
[1453.64 --> 1459.80]  Bow I to the counten fly
[1459.80 --> 1465.80]  Wash me, Savior, or I die
[1465.80 --> 1474.80]  While I draw this fleeting breath
[1474.80 --> 1480.92]  When my eyes shall close in death
[1480.92 --> 1485.80]  When I soar to worlds unknown
[1485.80 --> 1492.80]  See thee on thy judgment throne
[1492.80 --> 1493.42]  See thee on thy judgment throne
[1493.42 --> 1499.48]  Rock of Ages, cleft for me
[1499.48 --> 1505.80]  Let me hide myself in thee
[1505.80 --> 1516.70]  I have a note here
[1516.70 --> 1520.14]  Children ages three to grade one
[1520.14 --> 1522.08]  Are welcome to go to Sunday school
[1522.08 --> 1523.42]  Are there children to go?
[1524.28 --> 1525.30]  The teachers are there
[1525.30 --> 1528.16]  And they're waiting for you little ones
[1528.16 --> 1528.62]  Enjoy!
[1531.62 --> 1532.80]  And listen to them
[1532.80 --> 1533.84]  They know everything
[1533.84 --> 1540.24]  Okay, we're going to read now
[1540.24 --> 1543.96]  From the Gospel of Matthew
[1543.96 --> 1546.50]  And chapter 18
[1546.50 --> 1552.24]  Sorry, I should say chapter 14
[1552.24 --> 1552.80]  My bad
[1552.80 --> 1557.58]  Chapter 14
[1557.58 --> 1559.26]  And we're beginning at verse 22
[1559.26 --> 1572.58]  This is Jesus
[1572.58 --> 1574.78]  And it's just worth mentioning
[1574.78 --> 1576.48]  Before we get into the reading
[1576.48 --> 1580.04]  That this story comes immediately
[1580.04 --> 1582.58]  After Jesus feeds the 5,000
[1582.58 --> 1585.68]  Okay, and then he's dismissing the crowds
[1585.68 --> 1588.72]  After feeding all those many, many people
[1588.72 --> 1591.48]  And then here's where the story begins
[1591.48 --> 1593.98]  Immediately Jesus made his disciples
[1593.98 --> 1595.60]  Get into the boat
[1595.60 --> 1597.28]  And go on ahead of him
[1597.28 --> 1598.70]  To the other side
[1598.70 --> 1601.04]  While he dismissed the crowd
[1601.04 --> 1603.54]  After he had dismissed them
[1603.54 --> 1605.38]  He went up on a mountainside
[1605.38 --> 1607.00]  By himself to pray
[1607.00 --> 1609.44]  Later that night
[1609.44 --> 1610.84]  He was there alone
[1610.84 --> 1613.18]  And the boat
[1613.18 --> 1615.04]  Was already a considerable distance
[1615.04 --> 1615.80]  From the land
[1615.80 --> 1617.58]  Buffeted by the waves
[1617.58 --> 1619.54]  Because the wind was against it
[1619.54 --> 1622.10]  Shortly before dawn
[1622.10 --> 1623.80]  Jesus went out to them
[1623.80 --> 1625.76]  Walking on the lake
[1625.76 --> 1628.48]  When the disciples saw him
[1628.48 --> 1629.70]  Walking on the lake
[1629.70 --> 1630.82]  They were terrified
[1630.82 --> 1631.68]  It's a ghost!
[1631.82 --> 1632.22]  They said
[1632.22 --> 1633.80]  And they cried out in fear
[1633.80 --> 1636.70]  And Jesus immediately said to them
[1636.70 --> 1637.62]  Take courage
[1637.62 --> 1638.44]  It is I
[1638.44 --> 1639.88]  Don't be afraid
[1639.88 --> 1642.48]  Lord, if it's you
[1642.48 --> 1643.62]  Peter replied
[1643.62 --> 1645.42]  Tell me to come to you
[1645.42 --> 1646.56]  On the water
[1646.56 --> 1647.98]  Come
[1647.98 --> 1649.26]  He said
[1649.26 --> 1651.92]  Then Peter got down
[1651.92 --> 1652.80]  Out of the boat
[1652.80 --> 1654.80]  Walked on the water
[1654.80 --> 1656.54]  And came toward
[1656.54 --> 1658.72]  And came toward Jesus
[1658.72 --> 1660.04]  But
[1660.04 --> 1661.50]  When he saw the wind
[1661.50 --> 1662.38]  He was afraid
[1662.38 --> 1663.36]  And began to sink
[1663.36 --> 1664.04]  And cried out
[1664.04 --> 1665.54]  Lord, save me
[1665.54 --> 1667.72]  Immediately Jesus
[1667.72 --> 1668.96]  Reached out his hand
[1668.96 --> 1669.56]  And caught him
[1669.56 --> 1671.48]  You of little faith
[1671.48 --> 1672.28]  He said
[1672.28 --> 1673.38]  Why do you doubt?
[1674.66 --> 1675.50]  And when they climbed
[1675.50 --> 1676.24]  Into the boat
[1676.24 --> 1677.50]  The wind died down
[1677.50 --> 1678.92]  And then those
[1678.92 --> 1680.22]  Who were in the boat
[1680.22 --> 1680.96]  Worshipped him
[1680.96 --> 1681.38]  Saying
[1681.38 --> 1681.94]  Truly
[1681.94 --> 1683.38]  You are
[1683.38 --> 1685.06]  The son of God
[1685.06 --> 1686.40]  So
[1686.40 --> 1687.46]  That's the reading
[1687.46 --> 1688.38]  This is the word of God
[1688.38 --> 1690.06]  Thanks be to God
[1690.06 --> 1691.54]  You know
[1691.54 --> 1692.68]  Something in this story
[1692.68 --> 1693.80]  Makes me
[1693.80 --> 1696.30]  Want to add an extra line
[1696.30 --> 1697.60]  With the
[1697.60 --> 1700.62]  With the moral of the story
[1700.62 --> 1702.26]  Sort of like Aesop did
[1702.26 --> 1703.04]  With his fables
[1703.04 --> 1703.28]  You know
[1703.28 --> 1704.38]  Long ago
[1704.38 --> 1705.98]  You know
[1705.98 --> 1707.20]  In ancient Greece
[1707.20 --> 1708.28]  Aesop would tell
[1708.28 --> 1710.14]  These fun little stories
[1710.14 --> 1711.86]  And then
[1711.86 --> 1713.38]  At the end of the story
[1713.38 --> 1714.62]  He would
[1714.62 --> 1716.44]  Add the moral
[1716.44 --> 1717.38]  Of the story
[1717.38 --> 1718.78]  So for instance
[1718.78 --> 1720.16]  The hare and the tortoise
[1720.16 --> 1721.00]  Or the rabbit
[1721.00 --> 1721.60]  And the turtle
[1721.60 --> 1722.28]  You know
[1722.28 --> 1723.54]  The rabbit teased
[1723.54 --> 1724.08]  The turtle
[1724.08 --> 1725.04]  Because the turtle
[1725.04 --> 1727.16]  Was so slow
[1727.16 --> 1728.64]  And so
[1728.64 --> 1729.32]  The turtle
[1729.32 --> 1730.56]  Challenged the rabbit
[1730.56 --> 1731.36]  To a race
[1731.36 --> 1732.70]  The rabbit
[1732.70 --> 1733.84]  Could not resist
[1733.84 --> 1735.30]  He shot off
[1735.30 --> 1736.24]  In a
[1736.24 --> 1737.00]  You know
[1737.00 --> 1738.16]  High speed
[1738.16 --> 1739.08]  Built a
[1739.08 --> 1740.12]  Huge lead
[1740.12 --> 1741.26]  And then he
[1741.26 --> 1742.42]  Lay down to rest
[1742.42 --> 1744.44]  And he fell asleep
[1744.44 --> 1746.68]  And while he slept
[1746.68 --> 1748.08]  This turtle
[1748.08 --> 1749.80]  Came on
[1749.80 --> 1751.42]  In its slow
[1751.42 --> 1752.88]  And steady pace
[1752.88 --> 1754.54]  He passed the turtle
[1754.54 --> 1755.44]  And eventually
[1755.44 --> 1757.08]  He crossed the finish line
[1757.08 --> 1758.12]  Before the rabbit
[1758.12 --> 1761.12]  And the moral of the story is
[1761.12 --> 1763.20]  Slow and steady
[1763.20 --> 1764.62]  Wins the race
[1764.62 --> 1767.70]  Or the boy who cried wolf
[1767.70 --> 1768.94]  You know
[1768.94 --> 1769.38]  He was
[1769.38 --> 1770.80]  The boy was up in the meadow
[1770.80 --> 1772.32]  Guarding the sheep
[1772.32 --> 1773.32]  Of the village
[1773.32 --> 1775.42]  And it was boring
[1775.42 --> 1776.38]  And so he
[1776.38 --> 1778.04]  Decided to have some fun
[1778.04 --> 1778.90]  He ran down
[1778.90 --> 1779.40]  To the village
[1779.40 --> 1779.80]  And shouted
[1779.80 --> 1780.42]  Wolf!
[1780.54 --> 1780.84]  Wolf!
[1781.42 --> 1782.22]  So all the villagers
[1782.22 --> 1783.04]  Rushed up to
[1783.04 --> 1784.20]  Save the sheep
[1784.20 --> 1785.36]  And chase away the wolf
[1785.36 --> 1787.98]  But there was no wolf
[1787.98 --> 1789.74]  It was a joke
[1789.74 --> 1791.64]  And the shepherd boy
[1791.64 --> 1792.50]  Had his fun
[1792.50 --> 1793.86]  So he did it again
[1793.86 --> 1795.54]  And he did it again
[1795.54 --> 1796.06]  And again
[1796.06 --> 1797.82]  And then one day
[1797.82 --> 1799.34]  There was a real wolf
[1799.34 --> 1800.52]  And he ran down
[1800.52 --> 1801.08]  Into the village
[1801.08 --> 1801.48]  Shouting
[1801.48 --> 1801.92]  Wolf!
[1802.04 --> 1802.38]  Wolf!
[1802.38 --> 1804.48]  And nobody listened
[1804.48 --> 1806.84]  And the sheep
[1806.84 --> 1807.64]  Were lost
[1807.64 --> 1810.08]  And the moral
[1810.08 --> 1811.52]  Of the story is
[1811.52 --> 1813.56]  If you are a liar
[1813.56 --> 1816.62]  People won't believe you
[1816.62 --> 1817.86]  When you tell the truth
[1817.86 --> 1821.06]  So what about this story here?
[1823.56 --> 1824.30]  You know
[1824.30 --> 1826.54]  About Peter walking on the water
[1826.54 --> 1829.06]  And then sinking into the water
[1829.06 --> 1830.50]  It looks like the right
[1830.50 --> 1832.10]  Kind of a story
[1832.10 --> 1833.14]  For a moral
[1833.14 --> 1833.82]  Doesn't it?
[1836.20 --> 1837.42]  Well before we go there
[1837.42 --> 1839.10]  I should first tell you
[1839.10 --> 1841.28]  That there is a kind of alarm bell
[1841.28 --> 1843.22]  Going off in the back of my mind
[1843.22 --> 1845.42]  This alarm bell
[1845.42 --> 1846.50]  Was installed
[1846.50 --> 1848.32]  A long time ago
[1848.32 --> 1849.40]  About 40 years ago
[1849.40 --> 1850.40]  When I was a student
[1850.40 --> 1851.46]  At the seminary
[1851.46 --> 1854.16]  And they warned us there
[1854.16 --> 1855.30]  That we should not
[1855.30 --> 1856.60]  Use the stories
[1856.60 --> 1857.40]  Of the Bible
[1857.40 --> 1860.16]  For morality lessons only
[1860.16 --> 1862.26]  You know
[1862.26 --> 1863.42]  At that time
[1863.42 --> 1864.70]  They were very much
[1864.70 --> 1865.98]  Opposed to that
[1865.98 --> 1867.72]  Way of using
[1867.72 --> 1868.60]  The Bible
[1868.60 --> 1870.18]  Now it's tempting
[1870.18 --> 1870.80]  To do that
[1870.80 --> 1871.24]  For sure
[1871.24 --> 1872.46]  And the Bible
[1872.46 --> 1873.76]  Gives us a lot
[1873.76 --> 1874.96]  Of people
[1874.96 --> 1875.84]  And a lot of
[1875.84 --> 1877.18]  Characters and stories
[1877.18 --> 1878.04]  To work with
[1878.04 --> 1880.52]  So we see Moses
[1880.52 --> 1882.00]  He leads his people
[1882.00 --> 1883.48]  Out of slavery
[1883.48 --> 1884.06]  In Egypt
[1884.06 --> 1885.06]  And all the way
[1885.06 --> 1886.50]  To the promised land
[1886.50 --> 1888.44]  And he teaches us
[1888.44 --> 1889.54]  A lesson in leadership
[1889.54 --> 1891.60]  Or David
[1891.60 --> 1893.08]  He fights Goliath
[1893.08 --> 1894.32]  And wins the fight
[1894.32 --> 1895.92]  And he gives us
[1895.92 --> 1897.50]  A lesson in courage
[1897.50 --> 1899.60]  And then there's Elijah
[1899.60 --> 1901.68]  Who refused to bow down
[1901.68 --> 1902.76]  To a false god
[1902.76 --> 1904.20]  Even though everybody else was
[1904.20 --> 1906.06]  And he taught us a lesson
[1906.06 --> 1907.40]  In standing up
[1907.40 --> 1908.30]  For your beliefs
[1908.30 --> 1910.52]  It sounds right
[1910.52 --> 1911.10]  Doesn't it
[1911.10 --> 1912.46]  And for sure
[1912.46 --> 1913.38]  Leadership
[1913.38 --> 1914.82]  And bravery
[1914.82 --> 1916.30]  And standing up
[1916.30 --> 1917.04]  For your beliefs
[1917.04 --> 1918.74]  Are very good things
[1918.74 --> 1921.12]  But
[1921.12 --> 1922.24]  They warned us
[1922.24 --> 1922.94]  In the seminary
[1922.94 --> 1924.54]  There's more going on
[1924.54 --> 1925.76]  In these stories
[1925.76 --> 1928.56]  Than morality lessons
[1928.56 --> 1930.90]  There is a big
[1930.90 --> 1933.12]  Unfolding story
[1933.12 --> 1934.56]  About God
[1934.56 --> 1936.86]  And God's people
[1936.86 --> 1939.06]  And their place
[1939.06 --> 1939.98]  And their role
[1939.98 --> 1940.98]  In the world
[1940.98 --> 1943.08]  And in that big
[1943.08 --> 1944.78]  Unfolding story
[1944.78 --> 1946.42]  Each one of these
[1946.42 --> 1947.42]  Heroes of the faith
[1947.42 --> 1949.40]  Is doing his part
[1949.40 --> 1951.62]  So Moses leads
[1951.62 --> 1953.10]  Israel out of slavery
[1953.10 --> 1955.16]  And to a promised land
[1955.16 --> 1956.26]  Where that
[1956.26 --> 1957.70]  Where those people
[1957.70 --> 1959.06]  Will become a light
[1959.06 --> 1960.18]  To the nations
[1960.18 --> 1961.06]  Of the world
[1961.06 --> 1963.02]  King David
[1963.02 --> 1964.62]  United those people
[1964.62 --> 1965.32]  And made them
[1965.32 --> 1966.48]  Strong
[1966.48 --> 1967.08]  And it became
[1967.08 --> 1968.08]  A strong
[1968.08 --> 1969.78]  Solid nation
[1969.78 --> 1971.80]  And his victory
[1971.80 --> 1973.44]  Over Goliath
[1973.44 --> 1974.62]  It sort of
[1974.62 --> 1975.64]  Demonstrated
[1975.64 --> 1976.46]  That he had
[1976.46 --> 1977.74]  The capacity
[1977.74 --> 1978.88]  To do that
[1978.88 --> 1981.08]  Elijah
[1981.08 --> 1982.34]  He prophesied
[1982.34 --> 1983.34]  At a later time
[1983.34 --> 1985.14]  When God's people
[1985.14 --> 1985.92]  Were chasing
[1985.92 --> 1987.34]  After other gods
[1987.34 --> 1989.36]  And that whole nation
[1989.36 --> 1991.08]  Was at risk
[1991.08 --> 1993.34]  Of losing its way
[1993.34 --> 1995.80]  And Elijah
[1995.80 --> 1997.30]  Kept that candle
[1997.30 --> 1998.12]  Of faith
[1998.12 --> 1998.66]  Burning
[1998.66 --> 2000.50]  In the darkest days
[2000.50 --> 2002.28]  So each of these
[2002.28 --> 2003.34]  Heroes of the faith
[2003.34 --> 2004.30]  Had their role
[2004.30 --> 2004.82]  To play
[2004.82 --> 2005.96]  In that big
[2005.96 --> 2007.48]  Unfolding story
[2007.48 --> 2008.16]  Of God
[2008.16 --> 2009.08]  And his people
[2009.08 --> 2010.24]  And the nations
[2010.24 --> 2010.96]  Of the world
[2010.96 --> 2012.12]  And it all kinds
[2012.12 --> 2013.06]  Of leads us
[2013.06 --> 2014.08]  To the high point
[2014.08 --> 2014.80]  Of the story
[2014.80 --> 2015.74]  And that's
[2015.74 --> 2016.72]  Jesus himself
[2016.72 --> 2018.96]  And in his death
[2018.96 --> 2019.96]  And resurrection
[2019.96 --> 2021.76]  Jesus changed
[2021.76 --> 2022.50]  Everything
[2022.50 --> 2024.94]  And then Jesus
[2024.94 --> 2026.30]  Sent his followers
[2026.30 --> 2028.16]  Out into the world
[2028.16 --> 2030.44]  To tell the good news
[2030.44 --> 2032.04]  That God in Christ
[2032.04 --> 2032.76]  Is making
[2032.76 --> 2034.28]  All things new
[2034.28 --> 2036.60]  And one of those
[2036.60 --> 2037.88]  Messengers sent out
[2037.88 --> 2038.64]  Into the world
[2038.64 --> 2040.36]  That was Peter
[2040.36 --> 2043.38]  So his story
[2043.38 --> 2044.54]  Is more than
[2044.54 --> 2045.98]  Just a morality
[2045.98 --> 2046.78]  Lesson
[2046.78 --> 2048.58]  It's a piece
[2048.58 --> 2050.18]  Of the greatest
[2050.18 --> 2052.08]  Story ever told
[2052.08 --> 2052.88]  And you
[2052.88 --> 2053.42]  And I
[2053.42 --> 2053.90]  We're part of
[2053.90 --> 2054.82]  That story too
[2054.82 --> 2059.32]  And yet somehow
[2059.32 --> 2060.16]  With Peter
[2060.16 --> 2061.56]  When you read
[2061.56 --> 2062.34]  Through the gospels
[2062.34 --> 2062.52]  You
[2062.52 --> 2063.12]  You
[2063.12 --> 2064.76]  You can tell
[2064.76 --> 2065.86]  That something's
[2065.86 --> 2066.72]  Going on
[2066.72 --> 2067.58]  With this guy
[2067.58 --> 2069.22]  Because his name
[2069.22 --> 2070.92]  Keeps popping up
[2070.92 --> 2072.38]  And he keeps
[2072.38 --> 2073.90]  Sounding loud
[2073.90 --> 2074.98]  And proud
[2074.98 --> 2076.24]  And out there
[2076.24 --> 2077.84]  And over confidence
[2077.84 --> 2079.08]  And he looks
[2079.08 --> 2079.78]  Like a guy
[2079.78 --> 2080.94]  Who does need
[2080.94 --> 2082.28]  A hard lesson
[2082.28 --> 2083.46]  A good piece
[2083.46 --> 2084.22]  Of morality
[2084.22 --> 2084.86]  Has to be
[2084.86 --> 2085.74]  Stuffed down
[2085.74 --> 2086.38]  That throat
[2086.38 --> 2089.84]  You know
[2089.84 --> 2090.46]  It was Peter
[2090.46 --> 2092.02]  Who asked Jesus
[2092.02 --> 2092.30]  You know
[2092.30 --> 2092.98]  How many times
[2092.98 --> 2093.54]  Do I have to
[2093.54 --> 2094.28]  Forgive my brother
[2094.28 --> 2095.76]  If he sins
[2095.76 --> 2096.36]  Against me
[2096.36 --> 2097.60]  So he
[2097.60 --> 2098.40]  Kind of wanted
[2098.40 --> 2099.22]  A maximum
[2099.22 --> 2100.40]  On forgiveness
[2100.40 --> 2102.38]  He suggested
[2102.38 --> 2104.18]  Say seven times
[2104.18 --> 2105.90]  So forgiveness
[2105.90 --> 2106.70]  Is a good thing
[2106.70 --> 2107.34]  And all that
[2107.34 --> 2108.22]  According to Peter
[2108.22 --> 2109.82]  But you know
[2109.82 --> 2110.84]  You can carry it
[2110.84 --> 2111.60]  Too far
[2111.60 --> 2112.92]  So I'll do it
[2112.92 --> 2114.30]  Seven times
[2114.30 --> 2116.14]  And after that
[2116.14 --> 2117.72]  It's payback
[2117.72 --> 2118.68]  After that
[2118.68 --> 2119.86]  If you cross me
[2119.86 --> 2121.74]  I'm going to hurt you
[2121.74 --> 2123.32]  Real bad
[2123.32 --> 2124.18]  That was Peter
[2124.18 --> 2127.72]  When Jesus
[2127.72 --> 2128.50]  First told the
[2128.50 --> 2129.12]  Disciples
[2129.12 --> 2130.36]  About that
[2130.36 --> 2131.32]  Journey he would
[2131.32 --> 2131.88]  Be taking
[2131.88 --> 2132.88]  Into Jerusalem
[2132.88 --> 2134.08]  Where he would
[2134.08 --> 2134.80]  Be rejected
[2134.80 --> 2137.44]  And suffer
[2137.44 --> 2138.44]  Many things
[2138.44 --> 2139.28]  And be killed
[2139.28 --> 2140.58]  Then it was
[2140.58 --> 2141.42]  Peter who said
[2141.42 --> 2142.20]  Never Lord
[2142.20 --> 2143.00]  This will never
[2143.00 --> 2143.86]  Happen to you
[2143.86 --> 2145.80]  As if somehow
[2145.80 --> 2146.60]  It was up to him
[2146.60 --> 2147.80]  To decide
[2147.80 --> 2150.54]  When Jesus
[2150.54 --> 2151.14]  Announced that
[2151.14 --> 2152.18]  All the disciples
[2152.18 --> 2153.10]  Would forsake him
[2153.10 --> 2153.98]  In those dark
[2153.98 --> 2154.42]  Hours
[2154.42 --> 2155.48]  Here was Peter
[2155.48 --> 2155.96]  Again
[2155.96 --> 2156.68]  He said
[2156.68 --> 2157.52]  Even if all
[2157.52 --> 2158.12]  Fall away
[2158.12 --> 2159.00]  On account of you
[2159.00 --> 2160.28]  I never will
[2160.28 --> 2161.74]  Even if I have
[2161.74 --> 2163.14]  To die for you
[2163.14 --> 2164.66]  I will never
[2164.66 --> 2166.02]  Disown you
[2166.02 --> 2168.28]  Now we know
[2168.28 --> 2169.20]  How that ended out
[2169.20 --> 2170.86]  It ended with
[2170.86 --> 2171.44]  The sound of
[2171.44 --> 2172.68]  A rooster crowing
[2172.68 --> 2175.56]  So it's somehow
[2175.56 --> 2176.38]  It's like we're
[2176.38 --> 2177.36]  Supposed to pay
[2177.36 --> 2178.34]  Attention to Peter
[2178.34 --> 2179.16]  Like we are
[2179.16 --> 2180.04]  Supposed to have
[2180.04 --> 2180.54]  An opinion
[2180.54 --> 2181.80]  About his character
[2181.80 --> 2184.70]  And so I will
[2184.70 --> 2185.52]  Turn off that
[2185.52 --> 2186.40]  Alarm bell
[2186.40 --> 2187.28]  In the back
[2187.28 --> 2188.12]  Of my mind
[2188.12 --> 2189.72]  And moralize
[2189.72 --> 2190.28]  About Peter
[2190.28 --> 2191.00]  For a while
[2191.00 --> 2193.02]  Because it might
[2193.02 --> 2194.80]  Be that he
[2194.80 --> 2195.44]  Had to learn
[2195.44 --> 2195.90]  A lesson
[2195.90 --> 2196.78]  And it might
[2196.78 --> 2197.44]  Just be that
[2197.44 --> 2197.98]  I have to
[2197.98 --> 2198.54]  Learn the same
[2198.54 --> 2198.86]  One
[2198.86 --> 2202.30]  So let's go to
[2202.30 --> 2202.70]  The reading
[2202.70 --> 2204.54]  Peter and the
[2204.54 --> 2205.30]  Others are in
[2205.30 --> 2205.70]  The boat
[2205.70 --> 2206.98]  And they see
[2206.98 --> 2208.26]  Jesus at a
[2208.26 --> 2208.92]  Distance
[2208.92 --> 2209.46]  And they think
[2209.46 --> 2210.44]  It's a ghost
[2210.44 --> 2210.82]  And they're
[2210.82 --> 2211.62]  Terrified
[2211.62 --> 2213.52]  Until Jesus
[2213.52 --> 2214.18]  Says take
[2214.18 --> 2214.70]  Courage
[2214.70 --> 2215.84]  It's me
[2215.84 --> 2217.08]  Don't be afraid
[2217.08 --> 2219.56]  And then Peter
[2219.56 --> 2220.58]  Well Peter does
[2220.58 --> 2221.12]  The Peter thing
[2221.12 --> 2222.02]  Again and he
[2222.02 --> 2222.94]  Says well Lord
[2222.94 --> 2223.74]  If that's you
[2223.74 --> 2224.66]  Tell me to come
[2224.66 --> 2225.52]  To you on the
[2225.52 --> 2226.02]  Water
[2226.02 --> 2228.32]  Just what we'd
[2228.32 --> 2229.30]  Expect from him
[2229.30 --> 2230.30]  Isn't it
[2230.30 --> 2232.68]  As for Jesus
[2232.68 --> 2234.92]  Well for me
[2234.92 --> 2235.36]  That's a bit
[2235.36 --> 2236.06]  Of a surprise
[2236.06 --> 2237.62]  Because Jesus
[2237.62 --> 2238.80]  Goes along with
[2238.80 --> 2240.92]  This idea
[2240.92 --> 2241.70]  Of Peter's
[2241.70 --> 2243.76]  Now why would
[2243.76 --> 2244.72]  Why would
[2244.72 --> 2245.74]  Jesus do that
[2245.74 --> 2246.16]  Why would
[2246.16 --> 2247.50]  Jesus let
[2247.50 --> 2248.26]  Peter have
[2248.26 --> 2248.88]  His little
[2248.88 --> 2249.46]  Trick
[2249.46 --> 2250.04]  I mean is
[2250.04 --> 2251.06]  There a point
[2251.06 --> 2252.94]  Is this like
[2252.94 --> 2253.46]  A kind of
[2253.46 --> 2254.12]  Test
[2254.12 --> 2256.08]  I mean that's
[2256.08 --> 2256.66]  Not really
[2256.66 --> 2257.34]  Supposed to
[2257.34 --> 2257.88]  Happen right
[2257.88 --> 2258.26]  We're not
[2258.26 --> 2258.84]  Supposed to
[2258.84 --> 2259.50]  Put the Lord
[2259.50 --> 2260.46]  To the test
[2260.46 --> 2261.98]  Jesus said
[2261.98 --> 2262.78]  So himself
[2262.78 --> 2264.96]  He said it
[2264.96 --> 2266.02]  When the devil
[2266.02 --> 2266.66]  Was tempting
[2266.66 --> 2266.94]  Him
[2266.94 --> 2267.38]  Those three
[2267.38 --> 2268.38]  Great temptations
[2268.38 --> 2269.10]  And the last
[2269.10 --> 2269.40]  One
[2269.40 --> 2270.76]  The devil
[2270.76 --> 2271.34]  Took Jesus
[2271.34 --> 2272.14]  To the highest
[2272.14 --> 2272.82]  Pinnacle of
[2272.82 --> 2273.26]  The temple
[2273.26 --> 2273.74]  And said
[2273.74 --> 2273.98]  You know
[2273.98 --> 2274.88]  Jump off
[2274.88 --> 2276.44]  And the angels
[2276.44 --> 2277.04]  Of God
[2277.04 --> 2278.02]  Will catch you
[2278.02 --> 2280.70]  And
[2280.70 --> 2280.92]  And
[2280.92 --> 2281.20]  And
[2281.20 --> 2282.72]  Jesus says
[2282.72 --> 2283.10]  No
[2283.10 --> 2284.48]  And he even
[2284.48 --> 2284.98]  Quoted
[2284.98 --> 2285.66]  The book
[2285.66 --> 2286.46]  Of Deuteronomy
[2286.46 --> 2287.44]  You
[2287.44 --> 2288.06]  Not
[2288.06 --> 2288.90]  Do not
[2288.90 --> 2289.58]  Put the Lord
[2289.58 --> 2290.14]  Your God
[2290.14 --> 2291.74]  To the test
[2291.74 --> 2293.16]  In other words
[2293.16 --> 2293.92]  God doesn't
[2293.92 --> 2295.02]  Do stunts
[2295.02 --> 2296.66]  He doesn't
[2296.66 --> 2296.98]  Catch
[2296.98 --> 2297.80]  Tightrope
[2297.80 --> 2298.44]  Walkers
[2298.44 --> 2299.26]  Who fall
[2299.26 --> 2300.16]  Off the line
[2300.16 --> 2301.58]  He doesn't
[2301.58 --> 2301.96]  Heal
[2301.96 --> 2302.16]  He doesn't
[2302.16 --> 2302.54]  Heal sword
[2302.54 --> 2303.34]  Swallowers
[2303.34 --> 2303.82]  Who cut
[2303.82 --> 2304.68]  Themselves
[2304.68 --> 2305.48]  I mean
[2305.48 --> 2306.14]  He can
[2306.14 --> 2307.10]  He is able
[2307.10 --> 2308.62]  But that's
[2308.62 --> 2308.90]  Not
[2308.90 --> 2310.34]  How he uses
[2310.34 --> 2311.08]  His power
[2311.08 --> 2313.24]  He uses
[2313.24 --> 2313.86]  His power
[2313.86 --> 2314.88]  To give
[2314.88 --> 2315.44]  Sight to
[2315.44 --> 2316.08]  The blind
[2316.08 --> 2316.74]  To heal
[2316.74 --> 2317.32]  The sick
[2317.32 --> 2317.74]  To make
[2317.74 --> 2318.22]  The lame
[2318.22 --> 2318.60]  To walk
[2318.60 --> 2319.32]  He uses
[2319.32 --> 2319.86]  His power
[2319.86 --> 2320.46]  To feed
[2320.46 --> 2321.04]  The hungry
[2321.04 --> 2321.50]  And give
[2321.50 --> 2321.98]  Drink to
[2321.98 --> 2322.52]  The thirsty
[2322.52 --> 2323.38]  In other words
[2323.38 --> 2323.94]  He uses
[2323.94 --> 2324.58]  His power
[2324.58 --> 2325.52]  To do works
[2325.52 --> 2326.06]  Of love
[2326.06 --> 2326.78]  And mercy
[2326.78 --> 2327.96]  But walking
[2327.96 --> 2328.68]  On water
[2328.68 --> 2330.26]  That hardly
[2330.26 --> 2330.80]  Fits
[2330.80 --> 2333.12]  So why
[2333.12 --> 2333.74]  Does Jesus
[2333.74 --> 2334.54]  Let Peter
[2334.54 --> 2335.38]  Have his
[2335.38 --> 2335.96]  You know
[2335.96 --> 2336.86]  Cool new
[2336.86 --> 2337.70]  Thing happening
[2337.70 --> 2341.18]  You know
[2341.18 --> 2341.74]  I have to
[2341.74 --> 2342.08]  Think
[2342.08 --> 2343.98]  That for
[2343.98 --> 2344.38]  Jesus
[2344.38 --> 2345.10]  This is
[2345.10 --> 2345.36]  What we
[2345.36 --> 2345.92]  Nowadays
[2345.92 --> 2346.42]  Call
[2346.42 --> 2348.04]  A teachable
[2348.04 --> 2348.66]  Moment
[2348.66 --> 2350.30]  It's
[2350.30 --> 2350.98]  The right
[2350.98 --> 2351.80]  Time
[2351.80 --> 2353.44]  For Peter
[2353.44 --> 2354.16]  To learn
[2354.16 --> 2355.28]  A lesson
[2355.28 --> 2356.08]  Especially
[2356.08 --> 2356.94]  Him
[2356.94 --> 2358.26]  Now I
[2358.26 --> 2358.68]  Wonder what
[2358.68 --> 2358.98]  Jesus
[2358.98 --> 2359.56]  Has said
[2359.56 --> 2360.26]  If one
[2360.26 --> 2360.44]  Of the
[2360.44 --> 2360.66]  Other
[2360.66 --> 2361.20]  Disciples
[2361.20 --> 2361.76]  Had asked
[2361.76 --> 2362.28]  The same
[2362.28 --> 2362.62]  Thing
[2362.62 --> 2363.38]  A more
[2363.38 --> 2364.34]  Humble
[2364.34 --> 2365.30]  Disciple
[2365.30 --> 2365.92]  Someone who
[2365.92 --> 2366.60]  Wasn't so
[2366.60 --> 2367.34]  Loud and
[2367.34 --> 2367.84]  Proud
[2367.84 --> 2368.40]  And full
[2368.40 --> 2369.28]  Of swagger
[2369.28 --> 2370.80]  I can
[2370.80 --> 2371.24]  Imagine
[2371.24 --> 2371.68]  Jesus
[2371.68 --> 2372.38]  Saying no
[2372.38 --> 2374.84]  But for
[2374.84 --> 2375.28]  Peter
[2375.28 --> 2376.80]  This one
[2376.80 --> 2377.40]  Needs
[2377.40 --> 2378.20]  A lesson
[2378.20 --> 2380.10]  And now
[2380.10 --> 2380.56]  Is the
[2380.56 --> 2381.12]  Time
[2381.12 --> 2381.96]  To teach
[2381.96 --> 2382.20]  It
[2382.20 --> 2384.12]  Peter
[2384.12 --> 2384.66]  Has to
[2384.66 --> 2384.92]  Learn
[2384.92 --> 2385.64]  That yes
[2385.64 --> 2386.46]  He can
[2386.46 --> 2387.00]  Walk on
[2387.00 --> 2387.46]  The water
[2387.46 --> 2389.70]  And that
[2389.70 --> 2390.04]  No
[2390.04 --> 2391.38]  He cannot
[2391.38 --> 2392.30]  Walk on
[2392.30 --> 2392.78]  The water
[2392.78 --> 2395.18]  So Peter
[2395.18 --> 2395.84]  Steps out
[2395.84 --> 2396.72]  Out of
[2396.72 --> 2397.02]  The boat
[2397.02 --> 2398.12]  And he
[2398.12 --> 2398.88]  Looks to
[2398.88 --> 2399.48]  Jesus
[2399.48 --> 2401.26]  And he
[2401.26 --> 2401.78]  Takes a
[2401.78 --> 2402.08]  Step
[2402.08 --> 2402.54]  Toward
[2402.54 --> 2403.06]  Jesus
[2403.06 --> 2404.60]  And then
[2404.60 --> 2405.04]  Another
[2405.04 --> 2406.44]  And another
[2406.44 --> 2407.70]  And it
[2407.70 --> 2408.36]  Works
[2408.36 --> 2409.28]  He's
[2409.28 --> 2409.90]  Walking
[2409.90 --> 2410.68]  On
[2410.68 --> 2411.68]  The water
[2411.68 --> 2414.48]  And then
[2414.48 --> 2415.42]  Something happens
[2415.42 --> 2415.74]  There's a
[2415.74 --> 2416.68]  Gust of wind
[2416.68 --> 2417.24]  A slap
[2417.24 --> 2417.50]  Of a
[2417.50 --> 2417.78]  Cold
[2417.78 --> 2418.20]  Wave
[2418.20 --> 2418.54]  Whatever
[2418.54 --> 2418.98]  And he
[2418.98 --> 2419.74]  Looks around
[2419.74 --> 2420.94]  And he
[2420.94 --> 2421.26]  Becomes
[2421.26 --> 2421.90]  Afraid
[2421.90 --> 2422.76]  And he
[2422.76 --> 2423.10]  Begins
[2423.10 --> 2423.66]  To sink
[2423.66 --> 2424.56]  Into the
[2424.56 --> 2424.86]  Water
[2424.86 --> 2425.22]  And now
[2425.22 --> 2425.86]  It's not
[2425.86 --> 2426.34]  Working
[2426.34 --> 2426.94]  Anymore
[2426.94 --> 2430.92]  So Peter
[2430.92 --> 2433.12]  He can
[2433.12 --> 2433.70]  Walk on
[2433.70 --> 2434.22]  The water
[2434.22 --> 2435.66]  When his
[2435.66 --> 2436.16]  Eyes
[2436.16 --> 2436.88]  Are on
[2436.88 --> 2437.34]  Jesus
[2437.34 --> 2440.42]  When he
[2440.42 --> 2441.20]  Watches
[2441.20 --> 2441.80]  The one
[2441.80 --> 2442.72]  Who commands
[2442.72 --> 2443.40]  The wind
[2443.40 --> 2443.74]  And the
[2443.74 --> 2444.30]  Waves
[2444.30 --> 2444.66]  The one
[2444.66 --> 2445.16]  Who touched
[2445.16 --> 2445.78]  The lepers
[2445.78 --> 2446.28]  And brought
[2446.28 --> 2446.70]  Healing
[2446.70 --> 2447.08]  The one
[2447.08 --> 2447.72]  Who fed
[2447.72 --> 2448.50]  Great crowds
[2448.50 --> 2449.10]  With five
[2449.10 --> 2449.50]  Loaves of
[2449.50 --> 2449.68]  Bread
[2449.68 --> 2450.04]  And two
[2450.04 --> 2450.40]  Fish
[2450.40 --> 2451.46]  Who taught
[2451.46 --> 2452.14]  So well
[2452.14 --> 2453.28]  Who showed
[2453.28 --> 2454.02]  The power
[2454.02 --> 2454.74]  Of God
[2454.74 --> 2455.28]  And the
[2455.28 --> 2455.70]  Love of
[2455.70 --> 2455.94]  God
[2455.94 --> 2456.34]  With his
[2456.34 --> 2456.86]  Eyes
[2456.86 --> 2457.76]  On Jesus
[2457.76 --> 2458.16]  Peter
[2458.16 --> 2458.74]  Can walk
[2458.74 --> 2459.00]  On the
[2459.00 --> 2459.34]  Water
[2459.34 --> 2460.92]  But not
[2460.92 --> 2461.16]  If he
[2461.16 --> 2461.38]  Pays
[2461.38 --> 2461.72]  Attention
[2461.72 --> 2462.06]  To the
[2462.06 --> 2462.56]  Waves
[2462.56 --> 2462.92]  And the
[2462.92 --> 2463.22]  Wind
[2463.22 --> 2464.66]  Then the
[2464.66 --> 2464.88]  Wind
[2464.88 --> 2465.12]  And the
[2465.12 --> 2465.38]  Waves
[2465.38 --> 2466.16]  Will defeat
[2466.16 --> 2466.38]  Him
[2466.38 --> 2466.98]  And take
[2466.98 --> 2467.32]  Him
[2467.32 --> 2467.80]  Down
[2467.80 --> 2468.32]  And Peter
[2468.32 --> 2469.00]  Learns
[2469.00 --> 2469.74]  That lesson
[2469.74 --> 2470.34]  The hard
[2470.34 --> 2470.70]  Way
[2470.70 --> 2472.54]  The humbling
[2472.54 --> 2472.96]  Way
[2472.96 --> 2474.44]  The cold
[2474.44 --> 2474.94]  Wet
[2474.94 --> 2476.22]  Way
[2476.22 --> 2479.72]  Sometime
[2479.72 --> 2480.00]  Later
[2480.00 --> 2480.44]  Peter would
[2480.44 --> 2480.84]  Have to do
[2480.84 --> 2481.60]  Something even
[2481.60 --> 2482.24]  More difficult
[2482.24 --> 2484.12]  He'd have to
[2484.12 --> 2484.88]  Stand firm
[2484.88 --> 2485.64]  While Jesus
[2485.64 --> 2486.58]  Was arrested
[2486.58 --> 2487.56]  And put on
[2487.56 --> 2488.26]  Trial for
[2488.26 --> 2488.90]  His life
[2488.90 --> 2491.00]  And Peter
[2491.00 --> 2491.70]  Would see
[2491.70 --> 2492.36]  That happening
[2492.36 --> 2493.72]  He was there
[2493.72 --> 2494.76]  In the crowd
[2494.76 --> 2495.36]  Outside
[2495.36 --> 2496.72]  The courthouse
[2496.72 --> 2498.04]  And that's
[2498.04 --> 2498.70]  When somebody
[2498.70 --> 2499.70]  Recognized him
[2499.70 --> 2500.20]  And pointed
[2500.20 --> 2500.50]  At him
[2500.50 --> 2500.92]  And said
[2500.92 --> 2501.82]  That man
[2501.82 --> 2502.90]  He was with
[2502.90 --> 2503.54]  Jesus of
[2503.54 --> 2504.22]  Nazareth
[2504.22 --> 2506.32]  And then we
[2506.32 --> 2506.62]  Know what
[2506.62 --> 2506.94]  Happened
[2506.94 --> 2507.36]  Peter was
[2507.36 --> 2507.82]  I don't
[2507.82 --> 2508.22]  Know the
[2508.22 --> 2508.60]  Man
[2508.60 --> 2511.40]  That's
[2511.40 --> 2511.84]  A kind
[2511.84 --> 2512.74]  Of sinking
[2512.74 --> 2513.42]  Into the
[2513.42 --> 2514.18]  Waves
[2514.18 --> 2516.96]  What
[2516.96 --> 2517.58]  Happened
[2517.58 --> 2519.04]  And again
[2519.04 --> 2519.50]  It looks
[2519.50 --> 2520.10]  Like Peter
[2520.10 --> 2521.44]  Lost sight
[2521.44 --> 2522.34]  Of Jesus
[2522.34 --> 2523.66]  He forgot
[2523.66 --> 2524.50]  What Jesus
[2524.50 --> 2525.36]  Had told
[2525.36 --> 2525.76]  Him
[2525.76 --> 2526.64]  That the
[2526.64 --> 2527.08]  Son of
[2527.08 --> 2527.34]  Man
[2527.34 --> 2528.04]  Would have
[2528.04 --> 2528.66]  To suffer
[2528.66 --> 2529.32]  Many
[2529.32 --> 2530.00]  Things
[2530.00 --> 2530.84]  And be
[2530.84 --> 2531.18]  Killed
[2531.18 --> 2531.62]  It was
[2531.62 --> 2532.54]  All in
[2532.54 --> 2533.40]  The plan
[2533.40 --> 2534.30]  Of God
[2534.30 --> 2535.38]  It looks
[2535.38 --> 2535.74]  Like Peter
[2535.74 --> 2536.28]  Forgot
[2536.28 --> 2536.76]  About the
[2536.76 --> 2538.02]  Hard road
[2538.02 --> 2538.66]  Jesus
[2538.66 --> 2539.38]  Was taking
[2539.38 --> 2540.16]  And that
[2540.16 --> 2540.80]  His followers
[2540.80 --> 2541.80]  Would also
[2541.80 --> 2542.48]  Have to
[2542.48 --> 2542.94]  Take up
[2542.94 --> 2543.72]  That cross
[2543.72 --> 2544.56]  To follow
[2544.56 --> 2545.02]  Him
[2545.02 --> 2546.06]  Peter
[2546.06 --> 2546.76]  Got
[2546.76 --> 2547.82]  Scared
[2547.82 --> 2548.50]  Didn't
[2548.50 --> 2548.72]  He
[2548.72 --> 2551.18]  And
[2551.18 --> 2552.50]  Being
[2552.50 --> 2553.42]  Scared
[2553.42 --> 2555.08]  It's not
[2555.08 --> 2555.34]  A good
[2555.34 --> 2555.76]  Way of
[2555.76 --> 2556.10]  Following
[2556.10 --> 2556.80]  Jesus
[2556.80 --> 2560.20]  You know
[2560.20 --> 2560.52]  There's an
[2560.52 --> 2560.94]  Old hymn
[2560.94 --> 2561.28]  And you
[2561.28 --> 2561.88]  Probably
[2561.88 --> 2562.40]  Sung it
[2562.40 --> 2562.56]  Here
[2562.56 --> 2563.08]  Before
[2563.08 --> 2564.10]  It's
[2564.10 --> 2565.78]  It makes
[2565.78 --> 2566.26]  The point
[2566.26 --> 2566.66]  It says
[2566.66 --> 2567.60]  Turn your
[2567.60 --> 2568.40]  Eyes
[2568.40 --> 2569.24]  Upon
[2569.24 --> 2569.98]  Jesus
[2569.98 --> 2571.62]  Look
[2571.62 --> 2572.04]  Full
[2572.04 --> 2572.24]  Of
[2572.24 --> 2572.42]  His
[2572.42 --> 2573.24]  Wonderful
[2573.24 --> 2573.98]  Face
[2573.98 --> 2575.62]  And
[2575.62 --> 2575.78]  The
[2575.78 --> 2576.34]  Things
[2576.34 --> 2576.62]  Of
[2576.62 --> 2576.86]  This
[2576.86 --> 2577.54]  World
[2577.54 --> 2578.28]  Will
[2578.28 --> 2578.52]  Grow
[2578.52 --> 2579.42]  Strangely
[2579.42 --> 2579.88]  Dim
[2579.88 --> 2580.76]  In
[2580.76 --> 2580.96]  The
[2580.96 --> 2581.46]  Light
[2581.46 --> 2582.00]  Of
[2582.00 --> 2582.18]  His
[2582.18 --> 2582.72]  Glory
[2582.72 --> 2583.38]  And
[2583.38 --> 2583.98]  Grace
[2583.98 --> 2585.82]  When
[2585.82 --> 2586.34]  Jesus
[2586.34 --> 2586.84]  Is
[2586.84 --> 2587.16]  Your
[2587.16 --> 2587.68]  Guide
[2587.68 --> 2588.56]  Your
[2588.56 --> 2589.18]  Light
[2589.18 --> 2589.90]  Your
[2589.90 --> 2590.42]  Strength
[2590.42 --> 2590.84]  Then you
[2590.84 --> 2591.14]  Can
[2591.14 --> 2591.50]  Take
[2591.50 --> 2591.96]  Heart
[2591.96 --> 2592.40]  And
[2592.40 --> 2592.54]  You
[2592.54 --> 2592.70]  Can
[2592.70 --> 2592.90]  Be
[2592.90 --> 2593.70]  Unafraid
[2593.70 --> 2594.18]  And
[2594.18 --> 2594.34]  You
[2594.34 --> 2594.50]  Will
[2594.50 --> 2594.72]  Be
[2594.72 --> 2595.68]  Amazed
[2595.68 --> 2595.84]  At
[2595.84 --> 2596.04]  What
[2596.04 --> 2596.18]  You
[2596.18 --> 2596.34]  Can
[2596.34 --> 2596.64]  Do
[2596.64 --> 2598.18]  But
[2598.18 --> 2598.34]  When
[2598.34 --> 2598.48]  You
[2598.48 --> 2598.82]  Lose
[2598.82 --> 2599.12]  Sight
[2599.12 --> 2599.26]  Of
[2599.26 --> 2599.40]  Him
[2599.40 --> 2599.54]  And
[2599.54 --> 2599.84]  Depend
[2599.84 --> 2600.34]  Only
[2600.34 --> 2600.74]  On
[2600.74 --> 2601.44]  Yourself
[2601.44 --> 2602.76]  Well
[2602.76 --> 2602.98]  That's
[2602.98 --> 2603.14]  When
[2603.14 --> 2603.44]  Things
[2603.44 --> 2603.74]  Don't
[2603.74 --> 2603.90]  End
[2603.90 --> 2604.14]  Out
[2604.14 --> 2604.92]  So
[2604.92 --> 2605.32]  Well
[2605.32 --> 2608.66]  Okay
[2608.66 --> 2608.86]  I
[2608.86 --> 2609.04]  Have
[2609.04 --> 2609.10]  I
[2609.10 --> 2609.16]  Have a
[2609.16 --> 2609.40]  Picture
[2609.40 --> 2609.58]  To
[2609.58 --> 2609.82]  Show
[2609.82 --> 2609.98]  You
[2609.98 --> 2610.26]  Now
[2610.26 --> 2611.26]  And
[2611.26 --> 2611.44]  It's
[2611.44 --> 2611.64]  Going
[2611.64 --> 2611.84]  Up
[2611.84 --> 2611.94]  On
[2611.94 --> 2612.08]  The
[2612.08 --> 2612.50]  Screen
[2612.50 --> 2612.72]  It's
[2612.72 --> 2612.84]  A
[2612.84 --> 2613.20]  Painting
[2613.20 --> 2614.04]  By
[2614.04 --> 2614.80]  Rembrandt
[2614.80 --> 2616.02]  And
[2616.02 --> 2616.24]  It's
[2616.24 --> 2616.34]  A
[2616.34 --> 2616.70]  Painting
[2616.70 --> 2616.86]  Of
[2616.86 --> 2617.20]  Jesus
[2617.20 --> 2617.56]  And
[2617.56 --> 2617.72]  His
[2617.72 --> 2618.28]  Disciples
[2618.28 --> 2619.14]  On
[2619.14 --> 2619.30]  The
[2619.30 --> 2619.48]  Sea
[2619.48 --> 2619.64]  Of
[2619.64 --> 2620.18]  Galilee
[2620.18 --> 2620.90]  Now
[2620.90 --> 2621.10]  This
[2621.10 --> 2621.22]  Is
[2621.22 --> 2621.36]  Not
[2621.36 --> 2621.52]  The
[2621.52 --> 2621.74]  Story
[2621.74 --> 2621.92]  We
[2621.92 --> 2622.16]  Read
[2622.16 --> 2622.56]  Earlier
[2622.56 --> 2623.38]  This
[2623.38 --> 2623.52]  Is
[2623.52 --> 2623.88]  Another
[2623.88 --> 2624.84]  Story
[2624.84 --> 2625.16]  From
[2625.16 --> 2625.32]  The
[2625.32 --> 2625.72]  Gospel
[2625.72 --> 2625.94]  Of
[2625.94 --> 2626.42]  Matthew
[2626.42 --> 2627.48]  And
[2627.48 --> 2627.82]  It's
[2627.82 --> 2628.16]  About
[2628.16 --> 2628.64]  Jesus
[2628.64 --> 2628.94]  And
[2628.94 --> 2629.10]  The
[2629.10 --> 2629.52]  Storm
[2629.52 --> 2630.52]  But
[2630.52 --> 2630.70]  The
[2630.70 --> 2631.02]  Stories
[2631.02 --> 2631.24]  Are
[2631.24 --> 2631.80]  Obviously
[2631.80 --> 2632.40]  Related
[2632.40 --> 2632.84]  Because
[2632.84 --> 2633.12]  In
[2633.12 --> 2633.42]  Both
[2633.42 --> 2633.56]  Of
[2633.56 --> 2633.70]  Them
[2633.70 --> 2633.98]  There's
[2633.98 --> 2634.12]  A
[2634.12 --> 2634.48]  Boat
[2634.48 --> 2634.64]  In
[2634.64 --> 2634.86]  Both
[2634.86 --> 2635.00]  Of
[2635.00 --> 2635.14]  Them
[2635.14 --> 2635.30]  The
[2635.30 --> 2635.50]  Boat
[2635.50 --> 2635.62]  Is
[2635.62 --> 2635.76]  On
[2635.76 --> 2635.88]  The
[2635.88 --> 2636.04]  Sea
[2636.04 --> 2636.18]  Of
[2636.18 --> 2636.72]  Galilee
[2636.72 --> 2637.48]  Jesus
[2637.48 --> 2637.80]  Is
[2637.80 --> 2637.96]  In
[2637.96 --> 2638.24]  Both
[2638.24 --> 2638.82]  Stories
[2638.82 --> 2639.52]  So
[2639.52 --> 2639.70]  Are
[2639.70 --> 2639.86]  The
[2639.86 --> 2640.46]  Disciples
[2640.46 --> 2642.56]  This
[2642.56 --> 2642.86]  Time
[2642.86 --> 2643.06]  Though
[2643.06 --> 2643.26]  The
[2643.26 --> 2643.86]  Storm
[2643.86 --> 2644.18]  Is
[2644.18 --> 2644.70]  Way
[2644.70 --> 2645.02]  Worse
[2645.02 --> 2645.22]  Than
[2645.22 --> 2645.70]  Before
[2645.70 --> 2646.22]  It's
[2646.22 --> 2646.76]  Raging
[2646.76 --> 2647.26]  It
[2647.26 --> 2647.56]  Looks
[2647.56 --> 2648.52]  Terrifying
[2648.52 --> 2649.46]  And
[2649.46 --> 2649.80]  It
[2649.80 --> 2650.00]  Is
[2650.00 --> 2650.26]  So
[2650.26 --> 2650.78]  Bad
[2650.78 --> 2651.06]  That
[2651.06 --> 2651.22]  The
[2651.22 --> 2651.60]  Disciples
[2651.60 --> 2651.92]  Are
[2651.92 --> 2652.62]  Afraid
[2652.62 --> 2652.88]  That
[2652.88 --> 2653.04]  They
[2653.04 --> 2653.24]  Are
[2653.24 --> 2653.50]  Going
[2653.50 --> 2653.68]  To
[2653.68 --> 2654.02]  Die
[2654.02 --> 2655.24]  And
[2655.24 --> 2655.48]  And
[2655.48 --> 2655.82]  They
[2655.82 --> 2655.96]  Are
[2655.96 --> 2656.30]  All
[2656.30 --> 2656.52]  In
[2656.52 --> 2656.74]  Their
[2656.74 --> 2658.34]  Imaginations
[2658.34 --> 2658.72]  Thinking
[2658.72 --> 2659.00]  That
[2659.00 --> 2659.14]  In
[2659.14 --> 2659.26]  The
[2659.26 --> 2659.52]  Next
[2659.52 --> 2659.86]  Days
[2659.86 --> 2660.08]  Their
[2660.08 --> 2660.48]  Bodies
[2660.48 --> 2660.66]  Will
[2660.66 --> 2660.82]  Be
[2660.82 --> 2661.20]  Washed
[2661.20 --> 2661.40]  To
[2661.40 --> 2661.70]  Shore
[2661.70 --> 2661.94]  And
[2661.94 --> 2662.82]  Recovered
[2662.82 --> 2662.96]  By
[2662.96 --> 2663.16]  Their
[2663.16 --> 2663.64]  Families
[2663.64 --> 2663.96]  And
[2663.96 --> 2664.10]  Their
[2664.10 --> 2664.42]  Families
[2664.42 --> 2664.64]  Will
[2664.64 --> 2664.78]  Have
[2664.78 --> 2665.10]  Lost
[2665.10 --> 2665.32]  Their
[2665.32 --> 2666.10]  Breadwinners
[2666.10 --> 2666.32]  And
[2666.32 --> 2666.50]  It's
[2666.50 --> 2666.78]  All
[2666.78 --> 2667.16]  Just
[2667.16 --> 2667.34]  An
[2667.34 --> 2667.72]  Awful
[2667.72 --> 2667.94]  Thing
[2667.94 --> 2668.18]  That's
[2668.18 --> 2668.38]  About
[2668.38 --> 2668.56]  To
[2668.56 --> 2668.90]  Happen
[2668.90 --> 2669.18]  Here

[2700.00 --> 2700.38]  Point
[2700.38 --> 2701.48]  And
[2701.48 --> 2701.64]  Then

[2713.32 --> 2713.58]  There's
[2713.58 --> 2713.70]  The
[2713.70 --> 2713.96]  Face
[2713.96 --> 2714.12]  Of
[2714.12 --> 2714.44]  Jesus
[2714.44 --> 2714.92]  Himself
[2714.92 --> 2715.48]  It's
[2715.48 --> 2715.78]  Painted
[2715.78 --> 2716.10]  With
[2716.10 --> 2716.58]  Just
[2716.58 --> 2717.42]  A
[2717.42 --> 2717.66]  Few
[2717.66 --> 2718.54]  Strokes

[2718.72 --> 2718.84]  The
[2718.84 --> 2719.22]  Brush
[2719.22 --> 2719.68]  Makes
[2719.68 --> 2719.78]  You
[2719.78 --> 2720.14]  Understand
[2720.14 --> 2720.42]  What
[2720.42 --> 2721.16]  An
[2721.16 --> 2721.48]  Amazing
[2721.48 --> 2722.10]  Artist
[2722.10 --> 2722.68]  Rembrandt
[2722.68 --> 2723.14]  Was
[2723.14 --> 2724.16]  But
[2724.16 --> 2724.36]  That
[2724.36 --> 2724.76]  Face
[2724.76 --> 2724.96]  Of
[2724.96 --> 2725.38]  Jesus
[2725.38 --> 2725.90]  Is
[2725.90 --> 2726.76]  Calm
[2726.76 --> 2728.98]  And
[2728.98 --> 2730.20]  Even
[2730.20 --> 2731.16]  Kind
[2731.16 --> 2731.34]  Of
[2731.34 --> 2732.04]  Stern
[2732.04 --> 2734.26]  And
[2734.26 --> 2734.56]  It's
[2734.56 --> 2734.74]  Like
[2734.74 --> 2734.94]  He's
[2734.94 --> 2735.26]  Saying
[2735.26 --> 2735.76]  You
[2735.76 --> 2736.14]  Of
[2736.14 --> 2736.64]  Little
[2736.64 --> 2737.34]  Faith
[2737.34 --> 2739.00]  Why
[2739.00 --> 2739.28]  Are
[2739.28 --> 2739.46]  You
[2739.46 --> 2739.90]  So
[2739.90 --> 2740.62]  Afraid
[2740.62 --> 2742.66]  Eight
[2742.66 --> 2745.18]  And
[2745.18 --> 2746.12]  Of
[2746.12 --> 2746.52]  So
[2746.52 --> 2746.80]  There's
[2746.80 --> 2746.92]  A
[2746.92 --> 2747.42]  Lesson
[2747.42 --> 2747.68]  In
[2747.68 --> 2748.00]  That
[2748.00 --> 2749.02]  Story
[2749.02 --> 2749.30]  For
[2749.30 --> 2749.88]  Everyone
[2749.88 --> 2751.24]  Let
[2751.24 --> 2752.26]  Jesus
[2752.26 --> 2752.84]  Be
[2752.84 --> 2753.64]  Your
[2753.64 --> 2754.32]  Calm
[2754.32 --> 2755.18]  Center
[2755.18 --> 2766.40]  you know living scared has been a temptation in every age I'm sure but sometimes I wonder if it's
[2766.40 --> 2773.84]  worse than ever nowadays I mean I've heard that we live in a kind of risk averse culture like we
[2773.84 --> 2783.36]  don't like risk and we want to reduce it all the way to zero we are scared of trouble we're scared
[2783.36 --> 2792.40]  of danger we're scared of being hurt we're scared of being sued and so we do everything to make life
[2792.40 --> 2800.82]  super safe and risk-free I mean we put babies into car seats and we have them sleep in cribs with
[2800.82 --> 2807.98]  safety stamps we wear seat belts and bicycle helmets and we have fire alarms all through the
[2807.98 --> 2815.48]  house and we change the batteries regularly and those are all good things to do in some cases they
[2815.48 --> 2829.10]  are the law but in an odd sort of way making everything so safe kind of comes with its own
[2829.10 --> 2839.98]  kind of risk if we become we can become too timid you know if I'm afraid of being sued by someone who
[2839.98 --> 2850.04]  trips on my porch well then maybe I won't invite people over so much if I'm liable to be sued by
[2850.04 --> 2855.62]  someone who suffers injury riding in my car well then maybe I won't give rides to people anymore
[2855.62 --> 2862.58]  if I serve the wrong food to someone with allergies well then maybe I'll forget that potluck supper or
[2862.58 --> 2867.98]  the neighborhood party if I can get hurt by serving the church well then maybe I won't
[2870.50 --> 2880.88]  we can live scared can't we everywhere there are dangers the wind is so strong the waves are so high and
[2880.88 --> 2888.08]  there is no one to protect us so we become super careful or as John Ortberg once said we stay in the
[2888.08 --> 2897.00]  boats why even try to stand on the water bad things happen when you stand on the water when you take risks
[2897.00 --> 2926.98]  the water when you take risks like that well no says Jesus look look at me look what I've done look how I've lived look how I sacrificed my life for you look how I rose from the dead and I am coming again and I will make all things new keep your eyes on me
[2926.98 --> 2941.98]  and then stand firm let nothing move you always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord because you know that your work in the Lord is not in vain
[2941.98 --> 2947.38]  in vain so
[2947.38 --> 2959.66]  so is there a moral to this story well let me be brave and ignore the warning bill and say this turn your eyes
[2959.66 --> 2971.66]  on Jesus look full of his wonderful face and the storms will not scare you so much and the waves
[2971.66 --> 2978.34]  will not sink you because your eyes are always on him.
[2981.34 --> 2982.68]  Let's pray together.
[2984.88 --> 2989.16]  Dear Jesus, you are the way, the truth, and the life.
[2990.22 --> 2998.46]  You are also our hope, our refuge, our strength, our safety.
[2998.46 --> 3005.76]  Oh, Lord, help us to fix our eyes on you, to build our faith on you,
[3006.96 --> 3011.12]  and to trust that in all things we are safe in your hands.
[3011.22 --> 3013.16]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[3016.18 --> 3018.80]  Lead me, guide me along the way.
[3028.46 --> 3032.36]  Shall we stand and stretch a bit?
[3034.14 --> 3035.72]  Wonderful words that we heard.
[3035.72 --> 3056.90]  Lead me, guide me along the way.
[3056.90 --> 3072.48]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3073.04 --> 3077.80]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3077.80 --> 3087.76]  I am weak and I need your strength and power
[3087.76 --> 3095.40]  To endure with grace my weakest power
[3095.40 --> 3103.30]  Help me through the darkness your face to see
[3103.30 --> 3119.22]  Lead me, guide me along the way.
[3119.22 --> 3126.44]  For if you lead me, I cannot stray.
[3126.44 --> 3134.44]  Lord, let me walk each day with you.
[3134.44 --> 3140.88]  Lead me my whole life through.
[3140.88 --> 3150.26]  Help me walk in the paths of righteousness

[3214.26 --> 3221.26]  I am blind without your light to see.
[3221.26 --> 3228.26]  Lord, forever may I your servant be.

[3281.26 --> 3285.26]  Lead me along the way.
[3286.26 --> 3287.26]  Than you are living.
[3287.26 --> 3289.26]  Day on the way

[3548.58 --> 3550.58]  Thank you.
[3550.58 --> 3551.58]  Thank you.

[3567.58 --> 3568.58]  Timothy.

[3575.58 --> 3579.74]  Please give them comfort in the days ahead.
[3579.74 --> 3583.54]  We thank you especially though how Richie is doing.
[3583.54 --> 3589.00]  Please bless him and his family in the days ahead.
[3589.00 --> 3594.90]  Help us to know that though you do not always remove troubles from us, you always accompany
[3594.90 --> 3597.30]  us through them.
[3597.30 --> 3604.80]  Holy Spirit, guide this week that we may serve others and show the mercy of Christ.
[3604.80 --> 3607.50]  Father, hear our prayer.
[3607.50 --> 3609.78]  In Jesus name we ask this, Amen.
[3609.78 --> 3626.82]  Thank you for your prayers for the firefighters and also I think for the evacuations.
[3626.82 --> 3633.16]  I have a daughter, our second, and she lived in Yellowknife for seven years.
[3633.16 --> 3634.32]  The first seven years she was married.
[3634.32 --> 3638.58]  Her husband was in the office of one of the mining companies up there.
[3638.58 --> 3640.86]  And they made some very good friends.
[3640.86 --> 3643.28]  There's a couple they chummed around with a lot.
[3643.28 --> 3645.12]  They still take vacations together.
[3645.12 --> 3647.32]  They've even done a month in Europe together.
[3647.32 --> 3650.82]  Anyways, my daughter contacted her friend.
[3650.82 --> 3651.82]  Her name is Nikki.
[3651.82 --> 3653.66]  And they said, Nikki, how are you doing?
[3653.66 --> 3656.82]  So they were evacuated to high level.
[3656.82 --> 3659.02]  Now we've been through high level before.
[3659.02 --> 3664.52]  It's eight hours drive from Yellowknife to high level.
[3664.52 --> 3668.52]  And high level is just south of the 60th parallel.
[3668.52 --> 3672.52]  So it's just before you leave the province of Alberta and go into the territory.
[3672.52 --> 3674.52]  It's not much at all.
[3674.52 --> 3676.52]  There's a few hundred people there.
[3676.52 --> 3679.02]  And they've got to evacuate all these people.
[3679.02 --> 3681.02]  And her friend Nikki and her family were there.
[3681.02 --> 3686.02]  They were in a tent in a field and that's where they're sitting until this danger passes.
[3686.02 --> 3689.02]  And I'm thinking, these people all have to eat.
[3689.02 --> 3691.02]  They all have other things they have to do.
[3691.02 --> 3693.02]  The law of nature, the nature calls.
[3693.02 --> 3695.02]  Where are they all going to be?
[3695.02 --> 3698.52]  This is a massive thing that's happening there.
[3698.52 --> 3703.02]  But I understand that the city is 95% evacuated now.
[3703.02 --> 3704.52]  So they're all somewhere.
[3704.52 --> 3706.52]  It's a remarkable story.
[3706.52 --> 3707.52]  They need our prayers.
[3707.52 --> 3711.52]  So please remember them after we've done this service as well.
[3711.52 --> 3718.52]  Let me invite you to stand now and to receive God's blessing as you go.
[3718.52 --> 3723.52]  People of God, may the peace of Christ, which passes all understanding,
[3723.52 --> 3726.52]  keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[3726.52 --> 3729.02]  And God's people say, Amen.
[3729.02 --> 3732.52]  We will extol you, our God and King.
[3732.52 --> 3747.52]  We will extol you, God and King.
[3747.52 --> 3751.52]  We will extol you, God and King.
[3751.52 --> 3756.52]  Unless your holy name.
[3756.52 --> 3761.52]  Day after day, we'll sing your praise.
[3761.52 --> 3766.52]  Forever and forever.
[3766.52 --> 3772.52]  One generation will call to the next.
[3772.52 --> 3778.52]  Our God is good and His hand is strong.
[3778.52 --> 3783.52]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts.
[3783.52 --> 3793.52]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[3793.52 --> 3804.52]  Now may your name be so in every tongue, in every place.
[3804.52 --> 3814.52]  Singing the fame of your great love in every generation.
[3814.52 --> 3815.52]  One generation will call to the next.
[3815.52 --> 3820.52]  One generation will call to the next.
[3820.52 --> 3826.52]  Our God is good and His hand is strong.
[3826.52 --> 3832.52]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts.
[3832.52 --> 3841.52]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[3841.52 --> 3848.52]  Amen.
[3848.52 --> 3854.52]  Let us, let us.
[3856.52 --> 3859.52]  This is the very best aspects of all the talking andfollow here.
[3859.52 --> 3864.52]  And repenting in our hearts.
[3864.52 --> 3865.52]  Amen.
[3894.52 --> 3895.52]  Amen.
