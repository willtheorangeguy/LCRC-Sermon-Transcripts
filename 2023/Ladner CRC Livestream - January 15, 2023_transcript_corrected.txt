[464.00 → 466.00] mark 46
[466.00 → 472.24] that you've joined us and one way that we can get to know you is that in this the pocket and the
[472.24 → 478.68] bench in front of you may see a card and if you would be willing to you can fill that out
[478.68 → 483.74] and that would enable me to kind of meet you follow up with you and learn how we can serve you
[483.74 → 489.68] and if you do fill one of those out you can put it maybe in the offering basket that comes around
[489.68 → 495.52] later in the service, or you can hand it to me after the service as well one announcement before
[495.52 → 501.16] we begin our worship service is that you will find in your mailboxes or out in the foyer table
[501.16 → 507.90] a brochure about our upcoming cross-training class this is a class that we had planned even before
[507.90 → 515.34] the pandemic and what it is it's called I think the walk of faith, and it's an opportunity for some
[515.34 → 521.38] people in our congregation who wanted to or were willing to share their stories share their stories
[521.38 → 527.02] of god's grace and his faithfulness in their lives and how god has blessed them, and they want to be
[527.02 → 533.22] able to share that with each other, and it's an it's a great to hear testimonies from one another so this
[533.22 → 541.70] is especially a great chance for many of us to participate in order to support one another support
[541.70 → 547.38] those who are sharing and to learn from them and to learn with them so I encourage you to sign up for
[547.38 → 562.10] that class on the foyer table so why are we here this morning we all got out of bed we're here why we set
[562.10 → 573.22] aside our Sunday morning worship time to join as god's people in one voice in one heart to worship the triune god
[573.22 → 581.78] the king of glory god alone is worthy of our praise and worship, and we believe that god is with us
[581.78 → 587.30] in our worship this morning and by gathering together what are we doing here
[589.14 → 595.94] we are proclaiming to the world that god is on his throne that Jesus is at his right hand
[595.94 → 606.50] we are proclaiming that Jesus is our very life and that he is coming again amen so men women
[606.50 → 613.38] children of god I invite you to stand please rise in body or in spirit and let's sing god's praises
[613.38 → 621.54] Jesus together
[634.18 → 635.06] god
[635.06 → 648.06] O God, our Redeemer, Creator, in graceful devotion, our truth we pray.
[648.06 → 656.82] We live before you, we kneel and adore you.
[656.82 → 665.82] We bless your holy name and praise those who we sing.
[665.82 → 675.82] We worship you, God of our fathers and mothers.
[675.82 → 683.82] Through light, storm, and tempest are guide you and me.
[683.82 → 691.82] When perils o'retake us, you'll never forsake us.
[691.82 → 702.82] And with your help, O Lord, our battles we win.
[702.82 → 710.82] With voices united, our praises we offer.
[710.82 → 718.82] Our songs of Thanksgiving to you, we now raise.
[718.82 → 723.82] Your strong will guide us.
[723.82 → 727.82] Our God is beside us.
[727.82 → 737.82] To you, our great Redeemer, for every praise.
[737.82 → 756.82] Our Redeemer, our Creator, as we sang, calls us to worship and to adore Him this morning.
[756.82 → 761.82] So our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 37.
[761.82 → 768.82] This is later as we look at the third beatitude Jesus quotes from Psalm 37.
[768.82 → 771.82] That's why I chose it for our call to worship.
[771.82 → 774.82] But please join with me.
[774.82 → 780.82] And where it has the two arrows, I invite you to say it out loud together with me.
[780.82 → 784.82] Brothers and sisters, trust in the Lord and do good.
[784.82 → 788.82] Dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
[788.82 → 795.82] Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.
[795.82 → 800.82] Commit your way to the Lord, trust in Him, and He will do this.
[800.82 → 804.82] He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn.
[804.82 → 810.82] Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him.
[810.82 → 812.82] Let's pray.
[812.82 → 819.82] Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[819.82 → 822.82] You have set your glory in the heavens.
[822.82 → 830.82] And when we consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place,
[830.82 → 833.82] what is mankind that you are mindful of them?
[833.82 → 837.82] Human beings that you care for them.
[837.82 → 842.82] Lord, we marvel at the night sky and the beauty of the heavens.
[842.82 → 845.82] Each star you have set in place.
[845.82 → 848.82] And you know each of them.
[848.82 → 853.82] And even more astounding, Father, is that you know each one of us.
[853.82 → 857.82] You have known us from before the foundation of the world.
[857.82 → 860.82] And you know us each by name.
[860.82 → 862.82] And you care for us.
[862.82 → 866.82] We pray that you would be honoured and glorified in our worship, Father, this morning.
[866.82 → 874.82] We pray that each of us that you have called and gathered here would encounter you.
[874.82 → 880.82] And we pray that in your presence we would be in awe of your goodness and your faithfulness.
[880.82 → 886.82] And we give all glory, honour, and praise to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[886.82 → 890.82] One God, both now and forevermore.
[890.82 → 891.82] Amen.
[891.82 → 898.82] Here's God's greeting from Zechariah chapter 9.
[898.82 → 901.82] Rejoice greatly, daughter Zion.
[901.82 → 903.82] Shout, daughter Jerusalem.
[903.82 → 910.82] See your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, meek and riding on a donkey.
[910.82 → 913.82] He will proclaim peace to the nations.
[913.82 → 920.82] His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth.
[920.82 → 922.82] Praise be to God.
[922.82 → 923.82] Let's stand.
[923.82 → 929.82] And as God has called us and has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another.
[929.82 → 953.82] Thank you.
[953.82 → 983.80] Thank you.
[983.82 → 1013.80] Thank you.

[1201.82 → 1203.82] Thank you.
[1203.82 → 1205.82] Thank you.
[1205.82 → 1208.72] we open unto you.
[1208.72 → 1214.72] Allele, alleluia.
[1217.40 → 1223.76] We do not live by bread alone,
[1224.34 → 1229.22] not by every word.
[1229.22 → 1236.94] That proceeds from the mouth of God.
[1237.52 → 1243.08] Allele, alleluia.
[1247.28 → 1255.70] Alleluia, alleluia.
[1255.70 → 1265.70] Alleluia, alleluia.
[1265.70 → 1268.70] Alleluia.
[1268.70 → 1270.70] Alleluia.
[1270.70 → 1272.70] Alleluia.
[1272.70 → 1274.70] Alleluia.
[1274.70 → 1276.70] Alleluia.
[1276.70 → 1278.70] Alleluia.
[1278.70 → 1280.70] Alleluia.
[1280.70 → 1282.70] Alleluia.
[1282.70 → 1287.70] One of my favourite comic strips when I was a kid was Calvin and Hobbes.
[1287.70 → 1288.70] Who likes Calvin and Hobbes here?
[1288.70 → 1289.70] Okay, good.
[1289.70 → 1290.70] I'm a good company.
[1290.70 → 1296.70] You know, one of the titles of the book, and one of the themes often in the comic strips
[1296.70 → 1301.70] is the idea of a monster under your bed or a monster in your closet, right?
[1301.70 → 1305.70] So under, there's something under the bed drooling, right?
[1305.70 → 1310.70] And when you're a little kid, you think there might be a monster in your closet.
[1310.70 → 1320.70] And it takes a lot of courage to go to that closet, to open the door, and let the light shine in to expose what is in there.
[1320.70 → 1328.70] And this is true not only for the closets in our home, but it is true for the closet of our hearts.
[1328.70 → 1335.70] All of us, we have closets with secret sins in there, monsters, so to speak.
[1335.70 → 1340.70] All of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[1340.70 → 1350.70] But when we admit that, when we have the courage to open ourselves up to God, to allow His light to shine on us,
[1350.70 → 1355.70] that is when He meets us with His grace.
[1355.70 → 1362.70] He shines that light on us, He exposes our sin, and He forgives us, and He heals us of it.
[1362.70 → 1371.70] And so let's pray this psalm together, Psalm 25, and let's open the closets of our hearts.
[1371.70 → 1378.70] Let's allow the Lord to shine His light, to heal and to forgive and to restore us.
[1378.70 → 1381.70] Let's pray this responsibly.
[1381.70 → 1386.70] Show me, show us your ways, Lord.
[1386.70 → 1388.70] Teach me your paths.
[1388.70 → 1399.70] Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and my hope is in you all day long.
[1399.70 → 1408.70] Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old.
[1408.70 → 1414.70] Do not remember the sins of my youth in my rebellious ways.
[1414.70 → 1422.70] According to your love, remember me, for you, Lord, are good.
[1422.70 → 1428.70] For the sake of your name, Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
[1428.70 → 1435.70] Look on my affliction and my distress, and take away all my sins.
[1435.70 → 1448.70] And we serve a God who we just confessed is a God of love, a God whose mercy is of old.
[1448.70 → 1450.70] It has always been there.
[1450.70 → 1464.70] And in His mercy, in His love, in His power, His faithfulness to us, He forgives us, He draws us close to Himself in relationship with Him through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1464.70 → 1468.70] because of what Christ has done for us.
[1468.70 → 1475.70] So, friends, hear these words of grace, also from Psalm 25.
[1475.70 → 1478.70] Good and upright is the Lord.
[1478.70 → 1481.70] Therefore, He instructs sinners in His ways.
[1481.70 → 1487.70] He guides the meek in what is right, and teaches the meek His way.
[1487.70 → 1491.70] Hear and know that you are forgiven, and be at peace.
[1491.70 → 1493.70] Thanks be to God.
[1493.70 → 1500.70] So, I invite you to stand one more time, and let's sing a song of grace, beautiful Saviour.
[1500.70 → 1502.70] Please rise.
[1503.70 → 1504.70] Glory to Jesus.
[1504.70 → 1507.70] Jesus band, Mort Gesellschaft,
[1507.70 → 1509.70] execute all the things we can.
[1509.70 → 1512.70] Thanks be to God to his love, and serve 하나,
[1512.70 → 1521.66] not even my dear government officials Be part in Millikan,
[1521.70 → 1527.70] an honour.
[1527.70 → 1531.10] History and powder.
[1531.10 → 1540.54] Son of God and Son of Man.
[1540.54 → 1550.54] Truly I love thee, truly I serve thee.
[1550.54 → 1561.54] Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
[1563.54 → 1573.54] Fair is the sunshine, fair is the moonlight.
[1573.54 → 1583.54] Bright the sparkling stars on high.
[1584.50 → 1594.54] Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer.
[1594.54 → 1604.54] Let all the angels in the sky.
[1604.54 → 1617.90] Beautiful Saviour, Lord of the nations.
[1618.54 → 1627.54] Son of God and Son of Man.
[1627.54 → 1638.78] Glory and honour, praise and oration.
[1638.78 → 1650.54] Now and forevermore be Thine.
[1650.54 → 1668.00] So the children and teachers are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1668.00 → 1673.36] So this is for ages three to grade five.
[1673.48 → 1674.12] I can never remember.
[1674.12 → 1675.18] Yeah.
[1680.54 → 1696.50] And so for us here, we will continue on in our study of God's word and the Beatitudes in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five.
[1697.16 → 1702.74] The word Beatitude is a beautiful word that means blessing.
[1702.74 → 1711.56] And the eight Beatitudes of Jesus taken together are a portrait of what it looks like to be a disciple of Jesus.
[1711.84 → 1712.40] Right?
[1712.48 → 1713.58] These are the qualities.
[1713.84 → 1714.96] These are the characteristics.
[1715.60 → 1717.10] The kingdom virtues.
[1717.86 → 1725.62] The kingdom ethos that Jesus gave us in order that we would know that we are truly his disciples.
[1726.50 → 1731.12] So we are going to read the whole Beatitudes.
[1731.12 → 1733.14] It's Matthew chapter five.
[1733.34 → 1735.16] We'll read verses one through ten.
[1735.58 → 1737.98] I will begin by reading these first few verses.
[1738.20 → 1743.94] Then I'd like to do something a bit different, which is for each Beatitude, I will read the first part.
[1744.30 → 1748.34] Then I'd like you to respond and read together the second part, the promise.
[1749.52 → 1749.70] Okay?
[1749.74 → 1751.76] That way we can, each week we'll mix it up a bit.
[1752.24 → 1753.68] We'll see what happens next week.
[1754.94 → 1755.38] Okay.
[1755.72 → 1756.78] So here we go.
[1757.20 → 1758.42] This is the word of the Lord.
[1761.12 → 1766.80] Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[1767.76 → 1770.94] His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.
[1771.58 → 1772.18] He said,
[1772.18 → 1777.80] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1778.74 → 1781.20] Blessed are those who mourn.
[1781.20 → 1782.56] For they will be honoured.
[1783.56 → 1784.96] Blessed are the meek.
[1785.56 → 1787.76] For they will inherit the earth.
[1788.60 → 1791.96] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[1792.74 → 1794.24] For they will be filled.
[1794.24 → 1796.36] Blessed are the merciful.
[1797.16 → 1799.06] For they will be shown mercy.
[1799.40 → 1801.08] Blessed are the pure in heart.
[1801.70 → 1803.32] For they will see God.
[1803.80 → 1805.32] Blessed are the peacemakers.
[1806.10 → 1808.68] For they will be all children of God.
[1809.00 → 1812.16] Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.
[1812.88 → 1815.18] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1815.60 → 1816.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[1817.44 → 1818.52] Thanks be to God.
[1818.52 → 1819.24] Let's pray.
[1820.80 → 1823.10] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[1823.68 → 1824.90] Which is true.
[1825.66 → 1828.38] And which you have given to us because you love us.
[1829.24 → 1832.90] And we thank you once again that you have inspired Matthew the tax collector.
[1833.48 → 1836.54] To write down for us these words of Jesus.
[1837.66 → 1840.94] And would you help us this morning to understand what you said.
[1840.94 → 1845.62] And then even more than simply to understand.
[1846.12 → 1850.22] Lord, would you help us to encounter you in these words.
[1850.34 → 1856.02] Would you help us to live into the reality of these words that it is describing.
[1856.98 → 1861.44] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[1861.68 → 1863.66] Asking for the help of the Holy Spirit.
[1864.68 → 1865.02] Amen.
[1866.28 → 1868.44] So today we're going to look at the third beatitude.
[1868.44 → 1871.22] Where Jesus says in verse 5.
[1872.00 → 1872.28] He says,
[1872.68 → 1873.90] Blessed are the meek.
[1874.46 → 1877.18] For they will inherit the earth.
[1878.36 → 1880.56] Now we've already seen the first two beatitudes.
[1881.08 → 1886.74] We talked about how Jesus blesses the quality of being poor in spirit.
[1887.22 → 1889.00] We come before God empty-handed.
[1889.56 → 1891.84] Acknowledging our spiritual bankruptcy.
[1893.18 → 1895.78] And then that leads us to mourn.
[1895.78 → 1898.88] We mourn for our own sin and the brokenness of the world.
[1898.88 → 1906.20] And in a sense, I think we don't mind as much being poor in spirit.
[1906.58 → 1910.94] And we don't even mind as much mourning for our sin.
[1911.30 → 1914.36] Being both poor in spirit and mourning can seem noble.
[1915.08 → 1916.88] They can seem spiritual.
[1917.38 → 1919.64] It's what we should do as Christians.
[1920.62 → 1922.08] But meekness.
[1922.78 → 1923.94] Maybe that's another matter.
[1923.94 → 1927.56] Who wants to be meek?
[1928.22 → 1932.72] I mean, we all know in this world that doormats get stepped on.
[1933.76 → 1936.24] Who wants to be meek?
[1937.24 → 1940.12] Meekness is not a celebrated virtue in our world.
[1940.18 → 1947.54] Because it's fundamentally a part of human nature to want to project strength.
[1947.54 → 1955.42] This reminds me of a character on Saturday Night Live called Penelope.
[1955.58 → 1956.64] Does anybody know Penelope?
[1957.92 → 1958.22] Okay.
[1958.56 → 1959.42] John, he does.
[1959.76 → 1960.10] That's good.
[1960.96 → 1963.96] You know if you go on YouTube, you can find these skits.
[1964.40 → 1967.78] And so it has her in conversations with other people.
[1967.86 → 1969.88] Just people having normal conversations.
[1969.88 → 1976.10] And Penelope is always looking for an opportunity to one-up the other person.
[1976.22 → 1977.32] Whoever else is talking.
[1978.30 → 1983.58] So just to refresh my memory, I went on YouTube this week and there was a skit about Thanksgiving.
[1984.58 → 1985.98] And so someone will say,
[1985.98 → 1991.12] I just learned that my ancestors came over on the Mayflower.
[1991.74 → 1992.64] And Penelope says,
[1993.08 → 1996.34] Well, my ancestors came over on the April flower.
[1997.14 → 2000.20] So I guess they got here a little bit before yours did.
[2002.88 → 2004.00] Someone will say,
[2004.18 → 2005.72] They're proud of their three children.
[2006.08 → 2007.02] Penelope will say,
[2007.10 → 2007.96] Well, I have six children.
[2008.34 → 2011.00] They could speak 44 languages before they were born.
[2011.00 → 2015.94] Someone confesses to getting three speeding tickets.
[2016.42 → 2016.98] Penelope says,
[2017.06 → 2018.26] Well, I got nine speeding tickets.
[2018.38 → 2020.26] I was driving so fast I broke the sound barrier.
[2021.88 → 2022.84] It's ridiculous.
[2023.12 → 2026.06] It's kind of aggravating to watch even.
[2026.80 → 2027.66] It's funny.
[2027.82 → 2029.54] And we can relate to it.
[2029.58 → 2032.78] Because probably we all know people like this.
[2033.40 → 2038.22] But I think we can relate to it also because we can be like this.
[2038.22 → 2041.74] One time or another, to one degree or another,
[2042.32 → 2050.66] we also feel this sense where we need to be more important in the eyes of others.
[2052.14 → 2055.74] And it's because as men and women, we were created in God's image.
[2055.86 → 2059.14] We were created by God with great dignity.
[2059.72 → 2061.34] We were created with glory.
[2061.34 → 2071.70] But because of sin, the human heart, apart from God, we feel empty of glory.
[2072.28 → 2078.18] We feel like we have lost the dignity that we were created for.
[2079.50 → 2084.00] And because we experience this emptiness of glory, we are needy.
[2084.34 → 2085.24] All of us are needy.
[2085.30 → 2086.62] We need attention.
[2087.30 → 2088.36] We need recognition.
[2088.58 → 2090.18] We seek for glory.
[2090.18 → 2092.16] And so what do we do?
[2092.98 → 2095.50] We try to gain our own glory.
[2095.90 → 2097.64] We try to fill ourselves up.
[2097.72 → 2104.82] And we do it by competing, by stepping on other people, by pushing and shoving and trying to be first.
[2105.72 → 2107.80] And we spend our lives chasing this.
[2108.96 → 2112.58] And that's why we look down on meekness.
[2112.58 → 2122.64] And now if someone told you a person they know, you know, they're a really meek person, we might think, I'm so sorry.
[2122.64 → 2128.12] But Jesus isn't sorry.
[2128.36 → 2131.48] The word blessed, right, as we've said, means happy.
[2132.52 → 2133.26] Congratulations.
[2134.72 → 2137.94] And so Jesus is saying congratulations to the meek.
[2138.44 → 2140.82] Because they've got it right.
[2140.82 → 2144.12] Blessed are the meek.
[2144.50 → 2149.28] They're the ones who are in sync with God's kingdom.
[2149.66 → 2153.50] They're the ones who are in alignment with the heart of Jesus.
[2153.50 → 2162.26] So now here's something about the Beatitudes as a whole that I think is important to share with you that I haven't yet.
[2163.28 → 2169.10] The Beatitudes is not a menu that we get to choose from.
[2169.10 → 2176.52] Instead, all of these blessings, the eight blessings together, make a coherent whole.
[2177.34 → 2177.58] Right?
[2177.64 → 2181.06] It's all of them or none of them.
[2181.16 → 2182.46] That's the way the Lord meant it.
[2183.24 → 2192.32] So, you know, if we go in our imaginations back to that Galilean hillside where with Jesus as he's preaching this first sermon,
[2193.30 → 2196.02] the disciples are all gathered around him.
[2196.02 → 2201.12] The crowds also maybe kind of in the back listening in on his teachings.
[2202.30 → 2208.88] And Jesus did not turn to this group of people in the audience and say, you know,
[2208.98 → 2212.18] it's so good to see the poor in spirit here this morning.
[2213.00 → 2216.18] And then look over here and say, welcome to the mourners.
[2216.38 → 2218.80] So glad you got out of bed this morning and joined us.
[2219.28 → 2219.38] Right?
[2219.42 → 2224.58] He's not looking at these different groups and these different people, and you can kind of be one or the other.
[2224.58 → 2231.88] Rather, the Beatitudes are a complete picture of someone who has been grasped by the gospel,
[2232.16 → 2238.74] who is being recreated because they have met the real Jesus, they're indwelt with the Holy Spirit,
[2239.30 → 2243.70] and he is working the gospel into our hearts.
[2243.70 → 2250.62] So Jesus is describing a disciple from different angles, from different points of view.
[2251.62 → 2256.16] So the poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, they're all the same person.
[2256.62 → 2258.94] And each of these builds and leads to another.
[2259.94 → 2265.96] And here's a textual clue to help us see that this is really the way the Lord means it.
[2265.96 → 2269.62] So if we look in verse 3, the first Beatitude says,
[2269.92 → 2273.12] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2273.54 → 2276.68] Then the last Beatitude, number 8, in verse 10,
[2277.22 → 2282.66] Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2282.80 → 2282.94] Right?
[2283.00 → 2284.18] This is called an inclusion.
[2284.70 → 2287.72] So it kind of wraps the whole thing together,
[2287.72 → 2291.86] and it shows us that all of these Beatitudes belong together.
[2291.86 → 2298.46] And so again, Jesus in the Beatitudes, he's walking us step by step,
[2298.82 → 2304.16] more and more deeply into discipleship, into what it looks like to be a Christian.
[2305.54 → 2309.20] So now, again, we're in Beatitude number 3,
[2309.30 → 2312.98] so let's press in and let's try to understand a little bit more about what it means.
[2313.32 → 2316.98] Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[2317.82 → 2319.24] And we'll take it in two steps.
[2319.24 → 2322.64] Blessed are the meek, and then what does it mean that we will inherit the earth?
[2323.30 → 2324.14] So blessed are the meek.
[2324.24 → 2327.80] What is this quality that Jesus blesses?
[2328.00 → 2330.32] What does it mean to be meek?
[2332.06 → 2335.64] I think a good way to try to understand this word,
[2335.74 → 2338.90] which is kind of notoriously hard to understand,
[2339.28 → 2346.80] is by looking at the people in the Bible who are described as meek.
[2346.80 → 2352.86] There are only two people in the Bible who are explicitly called meek.
[2353.02 → 2354.14] Does anybody know who they are?
[2356.80 → 2357.20] Jesus?
[2358.06 → 2358.82] And one more.
[2360.12 → 2361.02] I'm not hearing it.
[2361.68 → 2362.00] Moses.
[2362.16 → 2362.68] I heard Moses.
[2362.98 → 2363.40] Those are it.
[2363.82 → 2364.80] Jesus and Moses.
[2366.86 → 2367.22] Mary.
[2367.46 → 2368.14] You said Mary, right?
[2370.02 → 2371.24] Does it say she's meek?
[2371.78 → 2372.12] Maybe.
[2372.60 → 2373.34] We'll have to look that up.
[2373.40 → 2373.80] I don't know.
[2373.80 → 2374.80] So I'm going to go.
[2374.88 → 2375.32] Yeah, thanks.
[2375.50 → 2376.00] You do that.
[2376.24 → 2376.74] I'll go with.
[2376.92 → 2378.20] We're going to go with Moses for now.
[2380.30 → 2380.74] Moses.
[2381.28 → 2382.46] Okay, so think about Moses.
[2383.04 → 2386.86] Moses is the guy who defied Pharaoh.
[2387.62 → 2389.88] The most powerful man in the world.
[2390.60 → 2394.44] He is the guy who led the people of Israel out of slavery.
[2394.44 → 2401.12] He's the guy who formed a nation, led them in the wilderness for 40 years.
[2401.92 → 2410.00] This is the Moses who went up onto the mountain to meet face to face with God when everyone else was too afraid to even go up on the mountain.
[2410.46 → 2415.00] And he is called the meekest man on earth.
[2415.14 → 2416.50] So numbers, there it is.
[2416.92 → 2417.72] Did we say this already?
[2417.72 → 2420.72] Just in case I missed it.
[2421.22 → 2427.04] Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all the people on the face of the earth.
[2427.14 → 2428.30] This is what it says about Moses.
[2429.14 → 2435.38] And so when we look at Moses, we see that meekness is not weakness.
[2436.54 → 2436.64] Right?
[2437.08 → 2442.54] Meekness cannot mean being spineless, being a doormat, not having a backbone.
[2442.54 → 2446.72] It cannot mean just lay down and take it.
[2447.74 → 2451.12] Because of who he is, who we see he is in the Bible.
[2451.70 → 2459.60] And when the Bible says that Moses was very meek, also let's recall the historical context of where that verse is.
[2460.00 → 2460.12] Right?
[2460.16 → 2466.28] What was going on with Moses when the Bible says that he is meek in Numbers 12?
[2467.04 → 2468.40] Well, what's going on is this.
[2468.40 → 2474.90] One day his sister Miriam and his brother Aaron challenge his leadership.
[2475.94 → 2481.44] They did not like the fact that God was only speaking through Moses.
[2482.18 → 2486.10] So they challenged his position in the life of the community.
[2486.32 → 2487.42] And they did so publicly.
[2487.88 → 2491.84] Which in an honour-shame culture was very shameful.
[2493.84 → 2498.22] Have you ever been publicly insulted or shamed?
[2498.40 → 2502.26] If so, how did you feel?
[2502.36 → 2503.84] What did you want to do?
[2503.92 → 2505.36] Or how would you want to react?
[2506.32 → 2508.72] Well, what does Moses do in this situation?
[2509.52 → 2512.96] He does not do what we might expect.
[2513.68 → 2516.22] He doesn't lash back at them.
[2516.50 → 2519.16] He doesn't try to knock them down.
[2519.96 → 2522.44] He doesn't get all worked up about it even.
[2523.02 → 2525.92] What he does is he gives it to God.
[2525.92 → 2530.38] He knows that God has called him to this role.
[2530.48 → 2531.74] I mean, he didn't even ask for this role.
[2531.82 → 2532.80] He kind of fought against it.
[2533.10 → 2534.32] God put him in this role.
[2534.64 → 2535.82] He was being faithful to God.
[2535.88 → 2538.40] And he knows that ultimately God is in charge.
[2539.76 → 2546.12] And so is this weakness on the part of Moses not to defend himself and not to get angry?
[2546.78 → 2547.68] Not at all.
[2547.68 → 2556.38] In such confrontations, it actually requires great strength and courage not to react in kind.
[2556.46 → 2560.36] Not to echo or mirror the other person's anger.
[2561.02 → 2563.18] That gets us nowhere.
[2564.64 → 2564.80] Right?
[2565.06 → 2570.84] The book of James says that anger does not produce the righteousness that God requires.
[2570.84 → 2576.66] So Moses was this strong, courageous leader.
[2577.48 → 2581.98] And in Moses, we see that meekness is not weakness.
[2582.60 → 2590.22] But meekness is a secret strength of being secure in our relationship with God.
[2590.72 → 2596.00] And it is being reliant on God rather than on our own strength to defend ourselves.
[2597.36 → 2600.50] So now let's consider, that's Moses, let's consider Jesus.
[2600.50 → 2607.98] So when we want to say what is meekness, Jesus is meekness.
[2608.74 → 2612.40] In Matthew 11, Jesus said this.
[2613.32 → 2616.20] Very familiar and loved passage.
[2616.72 → 2623.26] Jesus says, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[2623.26 → 2626.90] Take my yoke upon me and learn from me.
[2627.44 → 2629.70] For I am gentle.
[2630.22 → 2631.50] Translated gentle in NIV.
[2631.70 → 2634.28] It's the same word we see here in the Beatitudes.
[2634.50 → 2634.76] Meek.
[2635.72 → 2636.10] Meek.
[2636.36 → 2639.10] For I am meek and humble in heart.
[2639.52 → 2642.34] And you will find rest for your souls.
[2642.44 → 2645.20] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[2645.20 → 2654.76] I think this is the one time in the New Testament when the Lord told us about his heart.
[2656.04 → 2658.32] We know all about his miracles.
[2659.22 → 2661.18] We know about his teachings.
[2661.94 → 2665.44] We know about his death and his resurrection in the Gospels.
[2665.44 → 2677.52] But the one time when he really opens up to us, when he reveals the core depth of who he is, his truest self, what we see is meekness.
[2678.68 → 2684.78] And so what that tells us is that meekness does not start here on planet Earth, but meekness came down from heaven.
[2685.36 → 2687.44] Meekness is part of ultimate reality.
[2687.44 → 2690.28] Because it's part of who Jesus is.
[2691.76 → 2695.46] And when the Lord said to us, I am meek and humble of heart.
[2695.54 → 2697.42] My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[2697.74 → 2702.52] What he's saying is, I will do the hard part so that you don't have to.
[2703.58 → 2708.52] I will use my strength on your behalf.
[2709.66 → 2715.80] In other words, Jesus comes to us, and he says, I am giving myself to you.
[2715.80 → 2718.26] I did not come to take from you.
[2718.56 → 2719.62] I came to give to you.
[2720.56 → 2721.92] And that's what meekness is.
[2723.12 → 2728.58] It reminds me of Aslan, the great lion in C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia.
[2729.30 → 2733.18] At one point in the story, Lucy and Susan there, they're walking with Aslan.
[2733.30 → 2734.12] They get tired.
[2735.20 → 2740.30] And even though Aslan is this strong and mighty lion, in fact, he is the king of Narnia,
[2740.30 → 2750.92] he is gentle enough to let two little girls climb up on his back, hold on to his mane, and ride.
[2751.84 → 2755.34] I think that is such a picture of meekness.
[2756.16 → 2756.52] Right?
[2756.58 → 2763.32] The lion is strong, but he doesn't use his strength to make sure he's on top and to knock others down.
[2763.42 → 2765.24] He doesn't oppress people to get his way.
[2766.66 → 2767.48] He's what?
[2767.48 → 2769.62] He's meek.
[2771.40 → 2774.32] And Aslan the lion is meant to point us to Christ.
[2774.80 → 2778.38] So let's look at two episodes in the life of Jesus.
[2779.88 → 2787.14] When Jesus, in his royal procession, was entering into Jerusalem and all the crowds were singing and shouting,
[2787.52 → 2788.18] Hosanna!
[2788.72 → 2790.42] They're laying down palm branches.
[2791.00 → 2793.16] They're making a royal path for the king.
[2793.42 → 2796.72] The Gospel of Matthew cites this verse from Zechariah.
[2796.72 → 2799.10] See, your king comes to you.
[2800.22 → 2802.56] Translates it gentle again, but it's the word meek.
[2803.40 → 2805.32] Riding on a donkey.
[2806.88 → 2807.04] Right?
[2807.12 → 2814.64] So even in the midst of Jesus' royal display of power, he reveals himself as the king.
[2814.64 → 2820.44] The description of Jesus as a king is meek.
[2820.44 → 2831.56] And for the Jews who are expecting the Messiah to come, not in meekness, but in strength.
[2832.16 → 2837.44] I mean, we're saying meekness is strength, but in that kind of overt, knock people down kind of strength.
[2837.44 → 2840.82] They want him to come and get rid of the Romans.
[2841.32 → 2843.60] To restore Israel to its glory.
[2844.48 → 2851.00] And when Jesus comes meek, this would have been a huge disappointment.
[2851.68 → 2854.34] This is not what they were looking for in a Messiah.
[2854.34 → 2861.46] But Jesus, you see, wasn't living according to people's expectations for him.
[2862.04 → 2864.64] He was focused on doing the will of his father.
[2864.74 → 2870.68] His father sent him into this world on a mission to be a suffering servant.
[2871.34 → 2874.20] To be the meek saviour.
[2875.02 → 2877.94] And he was trusting in his father's plan.
[2877.94 → 2881.72] So that's one episode in Jesus' life.
[2881.80 → 2882.96] Now let's think of another one.
[2883.82 → 2885.52] Think of Jesus before Pilate.
[2886.68 → 2888.84] Jesus had just been beaten.
[2889.50 → 2891.00] He had been scourged.
[2891.78 → 2894.02] Blood trickling down his face.
[2894.86 → 2897.62] He's standing before Pilate and Pilate asking him,
[2898.00 → 2903.92] Don't you know that I have the power either to free you or to crucify you?
[2903.92 → 2912.82] And Jesus answered, You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.
[2914.14 → 2914.68] Right?
[2914.76 → 2918.30] Just imagine Pilate stepping back and just saying,
[2918.44 → 2921.50] Like, what kind of secret strength does this man have?
[2922.34 → 2926.92] What kind of secret strength that enables him to be so meek,
[2927.18 → 2931.74] so confident in the face of such wickedness?
[2931.74 → 2937.76] And so Peter, as we see here, he reflects on this later in his letter in the New Testament.
[2938.28 → 2940.02] He says about Jesus.
[2940.56 → 2942.16] You know, Peter just observing Jesus.
[2942.44 → 2944.92] Learning about what it means to be meek.
[2944.98 → 2945.46] And he says,
[2945.72 → 2948.98] When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate.
[2949.56 → 2952.54] When he suffered, he made no threats.
[2953.30 → 2959.12] Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[2959.12 → 2966.36] And friends, I think this is what meekness is all about.
[2967.14 → 2971.00] He entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[2972.04 → 2972.14] Right?
[2972.38 → 2973.94] Jesus is falsely accused.
[2974.28 → 2975.04] He's slandered.
[2975.16 → 2976.30] He's beaten and abused.
[2977.38 → 2980.84] And like a sheep to the slaughter, he doesn't say a word.
[2980.84 → 2985.04] Is it because he's afraid to speak up?
[2985.70 → 2988.12] Is it because he's feeling timid?
[2988.18 → 2989.40] Is he just beat down?
[2990.26 → 2990.60] No.
[2991.64 → 2994.90] When Jesus was suffering, he was thinking something else.
[2995.66 → 2998.30] He wasn't thinking, how am I going to get back at them?
[2998.72 → 3002.48] He wasn't thinking, you know, oh, I'm such a victim.
[3002.78 → 3003.36] I'm so poor.
[3003.36 → 3007.78] However, he was thinking, I'm going to trust in my father.
[3008.36 → 3009.60] I'm going to trust in God.
[3009.76 → 3012.90] These people are not in control of what happens to me.
[3013.54 → 3014.32] God is.
[3015.68 → 3017.30] And that is what meekness is.
[3019.20 → 3024.34] And he can do that because he already has the verdict of his heavenly father.
[3025.18 → 3025.40] Right?
[3025.44 → 3027.22] At the beginning of his ministry, God said,
[3027.22 → 3030.78] This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.
[3032.36 → 3034.80] And that is all that really mattered to Jesus.
[3035.52 → 3038.54] That was his inner strength.
[3039.10 → 3040.52] That's what he's focused on.
[3041.02 → 3042.30] The verdict of his father.
[3043.00 → 3044.20] He is loved.
[3044.68 → 3045.96] God is pleased with him.
[3046.56 → 3048.90] So no matter what happens, he can leave it to God.
[3050.34 → 3053.34] And so when Jesus sees us turning to him,
[3053.34 → 3057.54] And when we leave room for Jesus to defend us,
[3057.66 → 3060.08] When we're no longer out to settle scores,
[3060.98 → 3062.14] Jesus says to us,
[3063.04 → 3063.52] Blessed.
[3064.58 → 3065.22] Congratulations.
[3066.36 → 3069.78] That is what I'm talking about.
[3070.32 → 3071.62] You are tracking with me.
[3071.72 → 3073.04] This is the way of the kingdom.
[3075.54 → 3079.68] And so why is meekness a sign of being grabbed by Jesus in the gospel?
[3080.04 → 3083.00] It's because when the gospel breaks through into our hearts,
[3083.00 → 3086.28] It awakens in us a confidence in God.
[3087.44 → 3092.94] We have a secret strength that comes from having a relationship with God
[3092.94 → 3094.86] Because he is our heavenly father.
[3095.42 → 3096.82] And because he is our heavenly father,
[3097.26 → 3100.50] Nothing can happen to us that's outside his permission.
[3101.48 → 3105.84] And nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
[3108.16 → 3111.94] You know, in our time of worship, we had a confession, right?
[3111.94 → 3115.64] And in our time of confession, we admit,
[3116.42 → 3118.94] I am poor in spirit.
[3119.54 → 3121.06] I am a miserable sinner.
[3122.10 → 3123.82] But then as soon as we leave here,
[3124.46 → 3126.04] If someone comes up to us and says,
[3126.38 → 3127.44] You are a miserable sinner.
[3129.40 → 3129.84] Right?
[3129.92 → 3131.32] We just want to knock them in the face.
[3132.44 → 3133.60] Or at least tell them off.
[3133.60 → 3137.32] We don't mind acknowledging that we're a sinner to God,
[3137.42 → 3141.86] But we hate it for other people to think that we are, in fact, sinners.
[3143.96 → 3147.30] But the meek can let it go.
[3147.82 → 3148.84] They're free from all that.
[3149.16 → 3151.10] They have the verdict of their heavenly father.
[3151.92 → 3152.62] You are loved.
[3152.86 → 3153.76] You are forgiven.
[3153.76 → 3156.82] I am doing my work in you.
[3157.84 → 3159.68] They know who they are in Christ,
[3159.78 → 3163.04] So they don't need to seek the praise and approval of other people.
[3163.12 → 3164.56] It doesn't threaten who they are.
[3165.46 → 3169.90] They don't need to seek to gain their own dignity and glory
[3169.90 → 3173.84] That was lost to them because they look to God to fill them
[3173.84 → 3178.04] And to glorify them and to dignify them and to honour them.
[3178.04 → 3180.78] And when they are wronged,
[3181.16 → 3183.08] When they are talked of poorly,
[3183.48 → 3184.76] Or when they are hurt,
[3185.78 → 3187.92] They suffer injustice meekly,
[3188.30 → 3189.30] Like their Saviour,
[3189.72 → 3190.70] Trusting in God.
[3193.02 → 3195.60] And that takes us to, more briefly,
[3196.04 → 3197.84] To our second part of the beatitude.
[3198.62 → 3199.52] Blessed are the meek,
[3199.62 → 3202.56] For they will inherit the earth.
[3203.94 → 3205.68] So here I mentioned earlier
[3205.68 → 3208.32] That Jesus is actually echoing,
[3208.40 → 3210.70] He's borrowing from Psalm 37.
[3211.96 → 3212.36] So,
[3213.66 → 3214.46] Psalm 37,
[3214.60 → 3217.06] I encourage you to go home and read it.
[3217.42 → 3218.32] It's not too long.
[3218.44 → 3220.32] And it refers over and over again
[3220.32 → 3222.24] To this idea
[3222.24 → 3225.06] That God's people will own the land,
[3225.14 → 3226.52] That they will inherit the earth.
[3226.58 → 3228.84] And what's happening that we need to realize
[3228.84 → 3232.20] Is that David is composing this psalm.
[3232.20 → 3234.30] And what he's doing is he's wrestling
[3234.30 → 3236.52] With his age-old problem,
[3237.52 → 3239.42] That it is the pushy,
[3239.56 → 3240.24] And the powerful,
[3240.76 → 3242.00] And the self-assertive,
[3242.20 → 3243.64] Who seem to be winning.
[3244.92 → 3245.16] Right?
[3245.28 → 3246.64] David acknowledges
[3246.64 → 3247.68] That
[3247.68 → 3249.54] The dishonest
[3249.54 → 3252.24] Often do have more than the honest.
[3253.08 → 3254.38] And he acknowledges
[3254.38 → 3256.42] That those who step on others
[3256.42 → 3258.08] Do often get to the top.
[3259.08 → 3260.12] And he acknowledges
[3260.12 → 3262.34] That the rich can buy their way
[3262.34 → 3264.16] Out of the consequences of their evil.
[3265.50 → 3267.36] Yet in the midst of all of that,
[3267.50 → 3269.38] David makes this daring claim,
[3269.84 → 3271.72] Which Jesus repeats here,
[3272.24 → 3273.72] That the meek will inherit the land.
[3274.74 → 3278.12] So here's what Psalm 37, verse 11 says.
[3278.12 → 3280.30] A little while,
[3280.48 → 3282.00] And the wicked will be no more.
[3282.78 → 3283.86] Though you look for them,
[3284.00 → 3284.92] They will not be found.
[3285.44 → 3287.18] But the meek will inherit the land,
[3287.68 → 3289.78] And enjoy peace and prosperity.
[3290.80 → 3292.06] So David is saying,
[3292.38 → 3294.04] Contrary to all appearances,
[3295.08 → 3296.62] The meek are going to win.
[3297.80 → 3299.46] This is the upside-down nature
[3299.46 → 3300.60] Of the kingdom of God.
[3300.72 → 3302.08] And he says that the greedy,
[3302.42 → 3303.08] The competitive,
[3303.56 → 3304.54] In the end,
[3304.54 → 3306.78] Even in all their struggling
[3306.78 → 3307.72] To gain for themselves,
[3307.82 → 3309.26] They will lose everything they had.
[3310.02 → 3312.54] But the meek will inherit the earth.
[3313.76 → 3315.06] And Jesus is quoting that.
[3316.12 → 3317.18] And so he's saying,
[3317.30 → 3319.74] It's the meek who with open hands,
[3320.20 → 3323.16] Waiting to receive from God,
[3323.22 → 3324.26] Who trust in God,
[3324.64 → 3326.26] Who aren't trying to hold on to things,
[3326.48 → 3329.38] They will inherit the world from God.
[3329.42 → 3330.24] They will get everything.
[3330.24 → 3335.28] And so just as Jesus reaches back to Psalm 37,
[3335.58 → 3337.00] And he develops this,
[3337.04 → 3338.02] And carries it forward,
[3338.58 → 3341.42] So also as we continue to read in the Bible,
[3341.60 → 3344.02] The story continues and moves forward,
[3344.18 → 3345.22] To its conclusion,
[3345.74 → 3347.04] In the Revelation of John.
[3347.80 → 3350.28] Where these truths keep getting better.
[3351.38 → 3353.20] And so we find in the book of Revelation,
[3353.36 → 3354.26] At the end of the Bible,
[3354.56 → 3356.18] The eternal city of God,
[3356.42 → 3357.80] That we are going to inherit,
[3357.80 → 3360.54] Will come down from heaven to earth,
[3361.04 → 3362.52] At the second coming of Christ.
[3363.60 → 3364.70] And that is,
[3365.30 → 3366.32] This new heavens,
[3366.52 → 3367.24] This new earth,
[3367.62 → 3369.90] Is what we will inherit.
[3370.02 → 3371.06] It is the land,
[3371.44 → 3372.78] That Jesus is talking about.
[3373.02 → 3374.48] And we won't have to make payments.
[3375.04 → 3375.96] No more mortgages.
[3376.78 → 3377.84] No more rents.
[3378.32 → 3379.92] We will inherit it.
[3381.02 → 3382.52] We will be heirs.
[3383.18 → 3384.72] We will be owners,
[3385.44 → 3386.44] Not borrowers.
[3386.44 → 3388.92] Those who belong to him,
[3389.00 → 3391.12] Will inherit the earth with him.
[3391.60 → 3393.66] And this promise is so rock solid,
[3394.08 → 3396.52] Because Jesus is going to inherit the earth.
[3396.84 → 3397.82] The meek one,
[3398.10 → 3398.70] Jesus Christ,
[3398.78 → 3400.02] The one who is meek,
[3400.60 → 3401.82] He will inherit the earth.
[3401.92 → 3403.36] The earth is the Lord's,
[3403.36 → 3404.52] And all that is in it.
[3405.40 → 3407.54] And he will give it,
[3407.94 → 3409.04] To his very own.
[3410.30 → 3411.28] Let's pray together.
[3411.28 → 3415.92] Father,
[3416.04 → 3419.08] We thank you that we can set aside,
[3419.08 → 3422.80] The struggle of our hearts,
[3423.80 → 3425.64] The neediness,
[3426.16 → 3429.02] That we have because of our fallenness,
[3429.10 → 3430.12] To fill ourselves.
[3431.20 → 3431.62] But Lord,
[3431.70 → 3432.76] With empty hands,
[3433.40 → 3435.00] We come to you as your children.
[3435.00 → 3442.16] You are the God who showed us what meekness looks like.
[3442.80 → 3444.56] What it looks like,
[3444.68 → 3446.18] The true strength,
[3446.38 → 3449.12] The true virtue of your kingdom ways.
[3450.56 → 3452.06] And because you were meek,
[3452.62 → 3455.24] We can be meek.
[3455.42 → 3458.26] Because you were suffered unjustly,
[3459.16 → 3460.68] And did not open your mouth,
[3460.68 → 3461.16] Therefore,
[3461.32 → 3463.22] We can trust in you,
[3463.28 → 3464.00] And look to you,
[3464.04 → 3464.98] And receive from you,
[3465.02 → 3466.16] Because you are the king,
[3466.34 → 3467.80] Who has conquered death,
[3468.48 → 3469.14] In sin,
[3469.40 → 3470.46] And you reign over all.
[3471.90 → 3472.34] So Lord,
[3472.40 → 3473.06] We look to you,
[3473.10 → 3474.62] Even now in this life,
[3474.76 → 3474.90] Lord,
[3475.50 → 3477.28] Really all things belong to us,
[3477.84 → 3478.62] To enjoy,
[3479.52 → 3481.28] To receive from your hands,
[3481.96 → 3483.56] And you are giving us all things.
[3484.64 → 3485.36] So Lord,
[3485.46 → 3486.72] We are your children,
[3487.90 → 3488.42] Help us,
[3488.42 → 3488.64] Lord,
[3488.76 → 3490.66] To live in a meek way,
[3490.68 → 3491.28] In this world,
[3492.14 → 3493.06] To trust in you,
[3493.12 → 3493.66] To look in you,
[3493.70 → 3494.78] To have confidence in you,
[3494.84 → 3496.14] To have the strength of character,
[3496.44 → 3498.04] That only you,
[3498.18 → 3498.82] By your grace,
[3498.90 → 3499.86] And through the Holy Spirit,
[3499.94 → 3500.80] At work within us,
[3501.16 → 3502.72] Can accomplish in our lives.
[3503.18 → 3503.38] Lord,
[3503.44 → 3504.54] Would you do that work in us,
[3504.62 → 3504.98] We pray,
[3505.50 → 3506.28] In Jesus' name,
[3506.64 → 3506.92] Amen.
[3508.84 → 3509.96] So I invite you to stand,
[3510.08 → 3512.44] And we'll sing our song of response.
[3513.00 → 3514.08] Meekness and majesty.
[3520.68 → 3521.84] Amen.
[3524.56 → 3525.28] Amen.
[3526.02 → 3526.08] Amen.
[3526.16 → 3527.00] Amen.
[3527.00 → 3527.12] Amen.
[3527.12 → 3527.92] Amen.
[3528.02 → 3528.12] Amen.
[3528.18 → 3532.56] Amen.
[3532.66 → 3541.44] Amen.
[3541.44 → 3546.16] Nice.
[3546.16 → 3547.16] Amen.
[3576.16 → 3578.16] Amen.
[3606.16 → 3608.16] Amen.
[3636.16 → 3638.16] Amen.
[3666.16 → 3668.16] Amen.
[3696.16 → 3698.16] Amen.

[4031.56 → 4037.72] that many people can worship you in all variety of ways, Lord.
[4037.76 → 4038.76] For that, we praise you.

[4173.48 → 4179.76] And if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have what we asked of him.
[4181.00 → 4185.44] So provide our God, and we ask in all these things that your will would be done.
[4185.44 → 4191.06] And that we would receive from you, Lord, what you have for us.
[4191.54 → 4196.96] And we wait in confidence and in patience, knowing that you hear us, you know our hearts.
