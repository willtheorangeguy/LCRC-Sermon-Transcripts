[299.06 --> 301.06]  Good morning.
[301.06 --> 302.06]  Good morning.
[302.06 --> 306.06]  Welcome to our worship service at the Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[306.06 --> 311.06]  We're happy you could be with us today, whether you're in person or on YouTube.
[311.06 --> 316.06]  And if you're a visitor, we're especially glad that you're able to be with us today.
[316.06 --> 322.06]  Please join us afterwards for refreshments in the fellowship hall, straight out back there.
[322.06 --> 327.06]  I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader for part of today's service.
[327.06 --> 334.06]  And in today's service, Pastor Jason will continue with his sermon series, A Vision for Renewal.
[334.06 --> 338.06]  And also, today is GEMS Sunday.
[338.06 --> 346.06]  The girls everywhere are meeting the Savior, and we're happy that the girls will be able to participate during this service.
[346.06 --> 350.06]  You've probably seen them already doing some things for us.
[350.06 --> 353.06]  We have a few announcements before we start.
[353.06 --> 357.06]  Cross-training met this morning at 9.30.
[357.06 --> 364.06]  All are welcome to come and join the interesting discussions on George Herbert's Poems of the Christian Life.
[364.06 --> 368.06]  And there's two more opportunities for you to attend.
[368.06 --> 375.06]  A delicious soup and bun lunch is planned for May 14.
[375.06 --> 381.06]  If you're able to bring either your favorite soup or some buns, please sign up on the foyer table.
[381.06 --> 388.06]  Summer will soon be here, and Basic Skills Camp is hoping to meet in July.
[388.06 --> 398.06]  If you're able to join the camp organizing team or lead a skill, please contact Pastor Jason or Marcy.
[398.06 --> 403.06]  And next Saturday is the first of three membership classes being offered.
[403.06 --> 411.06]  If you would like to learn more about Christianity, our confessions, and our church, please contact Pastor Jason.
[411.06 --> 414.06]  And there's more information in the bulletin.
[414.06 --> 417.06]  Okay, I think that's all for that.
[417.06 --> 424.06]  Okay, our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 86.
[424.06 --> 431.06]  There is none like you, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
[431.06 --> 442.06]  All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.
[442.06 --> 446.06]  For you are great and do wondrous things.
[446.06 --> 449.06]  You alone are God.
[449.06 --> 455.06]  Let's come before the Lord with a prayer of adoration.
[455.06 --> 463.06]  Dear God and creator of all, we praise you for creating this world in all its beauty.
[463.06 --> 467.06]  For redeeming the world through Christ our Lord.
[467.06 --> 474.06]  And for sending us the gift of your spirit to encourage, instruct, and sustain us.
[474.06 --> 478.06]  We long for your spirit to work among us now.
[478.06 --> 480.06]  To inspire our praise.
[480.06 --> 482.06]  To challenge us with your truth.
[482.06 --> 486.06]  And to equip us for service in your world.
[486.06 --> 488.06]  Amen.
[488.06 --> 492.06]  Please rise for the Lord's greeting if you're able.
[492.06 --> 500.06]  The Lord greets us with these words from Jude 1 and 2.
[500.06 --> 503.06]  To those who are called.
[503.06 --> 506.06]  Who are beloved in God the Father.
[506.06 --> 509.06]  And kept safe for Jesus Christ.
[509.06 --> 514.06]  May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[514.06 --> 519.06]  As God has greeted us, let us also greet each other.
[519.06 --> 533.06]  Thank you.
[533.06 --> 542.06]  All the Pharaohs and The Heavenly City of Christ.
[542.06 --> 544.06]  Are you strong for receiving each other?
[544.06 --> 546.02]  I have...
[547.06 --> 548.06]  All three.
[548.06 --> 578.04]  Thank you.
[578.06 --> 608.04]  Thank you.

[842.06 --> 863.04] اس my plea

[869.40 --> 871.98] for
[871.98 --> 872.04]  экспirado
[872.06 --> 886.06]  Jesus, for he has said that he will bring me home, and day by day I know he will renew
[886.06 --> 893.06]  me, until I stand with joy and joy.
[893.06 --> 906.06]  In this I hope, my hope is only Jesus, all the glory evermore to me.
[906.06 --> 918.06]  When the face is complete, still my lips shall be me, yet not all, but through Christ in me.
[918.06 --> 931.06]  When the face is complete, still my lips shall be me, yet not all, but through Christ in me.
[931.06 --> 939.06]  Yet not all, but through Christ in me.
[939.06 --> 956.06]  When the face is complete, still my lips shall be me, yet not all, but through Christ in me.
[956.06 --> 963.06]  And our next song is from the GEMS program, one that they sing, and one that many of us
[963.06 --> 965.06]  have known for some time.
[965.06 --> 971.06]  It's been a while since I've enjoyed it in a service, and glad to have it with us today.
[971.06 --> 975.06]  Micah 6, 8, he has shown me.
[975.06 --> 982.06]  So there's a part that we sing as congregation, and the GEMS will be the answering part.
[982.06 --> 986.06]  And let's enjoy this together.
[986.06 --> 995.06]  CONGREGATION
[995.06 --> 1001.06]  He has shown me.
[1001.06 --> 1003.06]  He has shown me.
[1003.06 --> 1005.06]  Amen.
[1005.06 --> 1010.88]  Amen, what is good and what the Lord bring wise of thee.
[1012.08 --> 1015.10]  He has shown thee.
[1015.10 --> 1023.10]  Amen, what is good and what the Lord bring wise of thee.
[1023.10 --> 1035.60]  But to do justice, and to love mercy, and to welcome thee with thy God.
[1037.74 --> 1039.48]  He has shown thee.
[1040.94 --> 1047.06]  Amen, what is good and what the Lord bring wise of thee.
[1047.06 --> 1051.52]  He has shown thee.
[1051.52 --> 1059.16]  Amen, what is good and what the Lord bring wise of thee.
[1060.60 --> 1071.68]  But to do justice, and to love mercy, and to come play with thy God.
[1071.68 --> 1085.14]  But to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
[1088.14 --> 1089.38]  Thank you.
[1089.48 --> 1089.96]  You may be seated.
[1101.68 --> 1131.66]  Thank you.
[1131.68 --> 1133.68]  It's a message.
[1134.22 --> 1148.04]  That's a答 jam.
[1148.04 --> 1150.14]  Thank you.
[1150.14 --> 1152.10]  God, how am you?
[1153.54 --> 1155.62]  Thank you.
[1157.12 --> 1161.56]  Thank you.
[1161.68 --> 1174.48]  Behind you we will hear a Lord saying, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way.
[1174.48 --> 1176.68]  So walk in it.
[1181.30 --> 1186.10]  He has shown you what is good.
[1186.28 --> 1188.62]  What does the Lord require?
[1188.96 --> 1191.48]  What does the Lord require?
[1191.68 --> 1195.60]  You've got to act as the end.
[1195.98 --> 1198.18]  Love works the end.
[1198.64 --> 1201.92]  Walk humbly with your God.
[1201.92 --> 1220.96]  So whether you turn to the right or turn to the left, coming from behind you, we will hear a Lord saying, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way.
[1220.96 --> 1224.88]  So walk in it.
[1224.88 --> 1235.12]  You've got to act as the end.
[1235.12 --> 1237.04]  Act just the end.
[1237.04 --> 1238.28]  Act just the end.
[1238.28 --> 1240.38]  Love works the end.
[1240.38 --> 1242.96]  Walk humbly with your God.
[1242.96 --> 1244.20]  Oh, this is the way.
[1244.20 --> 1246.34]  Oh, this is the way.
[1246.34 --> 1248.30]  Act just the end.
[1248.30 --> 1250.88]  Love works the end.
[1250.88 --> 1253.20]  Walk humbly with your God.
[1253.20 --> 1254.44]  So whether you feel.
[1254.44 --> 1255.20]  You've got to act as the end.
[1255.20 --> 1257.12]  You've got to act as the end.
[1257.12 --> 1259.24]  That is the way.
[1259.24 --> 1261.12]  That is the way, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way.
[1261.12 --> 1271.12]  At just the end, love mercy ends
[1271.12 --> 1278.30]  At just the end, love mercy ends
[1278.30 --> 1281.44]  Walk humbly with your God
[1281.44 --> 1285.34]  So whether you turn to the right
[1285.34 --> 1288.14]  Or turn to the left
[1288.14 --> 1291.04]  Coming from behind you
[1291.04 --> 1293.72]  You will hear a voice saying
[1293.72 --> 1296.04]  This is the way
[1296.04 --> 1298.60]  This is the way
[1298.60 --> 1302.24]  This is the way
[1302.24 --> 1304.72]  So walk in it
[1304.72 --> 1309.66]  At just the end, love mercy ends
[1309.66 --> 1313.56]  Walk humbly with your God
[1313.56 --> 1315.66]  Oh, this is the way
[1315.66 --> 1318.12]  At just the end, love mercy ends
[1318.12 --> 1320.32]  Love mercy ends
[1320.32 --> 1324.02]  You won't find me with your God
[1324.02 --> 1325.94]  Just walk in it
[1325.94 --> 1331.82]  You won't find me with your God
[1331.82 --> 1361.80]  Thank you.
[1361.82 --> 1371.20]  For 50 years, girls and women from generation to generation have been united their voices to recite Micah 6 verse 8 in their Gems Club.
[1372.02 --> 1377.98]  Whether their club is in Canada, the U.S., Uganda, or 13 other countries, it sounds like this.
[1378.48 --> 1383.34]  Latin RCRC, Gems, and the Gems leaders, what does the Lord require of us?
[1383.34 --> 1391.42]  I am justly to love, mercy, and walk humbly with our God.
[1391.42 --> 1397.42]  This is who God is.
[1397.62 --> 1405.58]  I am the Lord, who ever has died in kindness, jealousness, and righteousness on earth.
[1406.10 --> 1409.70]  For he is the Lord, who ever has died in the Lord.
[1410.12 --> 1420.66]  In grateful response to who he is and what he's done for us through Jesus, we act, love, and walk.
[1420.66 --> 1428.60]  I am justly to find safety, passion, and feeling what is right.
[1430.14 --> 1435.80]  Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.
[1437.80 --> 1438.78]  Please come.
[1438.78 --> 1444.78]  Be patient, bearing with one another.
[1444.78 --> 1446.26]  Thank you.
[1447.26 --> 1450.72]  Serve one another humbly in love.
[1452.26 --> 1461.36]  Be walk humbly with God by saying yes to God, and walking in his way to the Lord alone.
[1461.36 --> 1465.62]  Be completely humble and gentle
[1465.62 --> 1470.06]  Be patient, bearing with whatever you love
[1470.06 --> 1475.10]  Equipped with God's word and compelled by his love
[1475.10 --> 1481.20]  These girls are making a difference as they act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God
[1481.20 --> 1484.36]  Let's encourage them, pray for them, and join them
[1484.36 --> 1488.82]  Because Micah 6 verse 8 isn't just for girls and girls, it's for all
[1488.82 --> 1489.74]  Are you ready?
[1491.36 --> 1498.40]  Girls, boys, and grown-ups, what does the Lord require of us?
[1499.12 --> 1505.32]  To act justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God
[1505.32 --> 1508.92]  Micah 6 verse 8, come on in
[1521.36 --> 1525.36]  Thank you, Gems
[1525.36 --> 1535.84]  For our time of confession, let us confess our sin before God and one another with these words
[1535.84 --> 1544.16]  When we see God's beautiful holiness, we recognize our own lack of holiness
[1544.16 --> 1551.28]  God is light and truth, yet we live among shadows and lies
[1551.28 --> 1557.20]  People of God, let us acknowledge who and whose we are
[1557.20 --> 1565.28]  Let us ask our powerful God to illumine us with grace and truth in Jesus our Lord
[1565.28 --> 1573.92]  And God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of sin is from Psalm 147
[1573.92 --> 1577.70]  The Lord builds up Jerusalem
[1577.70 --> 1581.14]  He gathers the outcasts of Israel
[1581.14 --> 1586.60]  He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds
[1586.60 --> 1590.38]  Great is our Lord and abundant in power
[1590.38 --> 1593.92]  His understanding is beyond measure
[1593.92 --> 1608.16]  You can remain seated for this song
[1608.16 --> 1627.16]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him
[1627.16 --> 1637.16]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him
[1637.16 --> 1646.54]  No one else can satisfy, I should come to Him
[1646.54 --> 1657.14]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him
[1657.14 --> 1667.14]  No one else can be my strength, I should come to Him
[1667.14 --> 1671.88]  For the Lord is good and faithful
[1671.88 --> 1676.62]  He will keep us day and night
[1676.62 --> 1681.84]  We can always run to Jesus
[1681.84 --> 1686.52]  Jesus strong and kind
[1686.52 --> 1692.20]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him
[1692.20 --> 1703.04]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him
[1703.04 --> 1708.18]  I should come to Him
[1708.18 --> 1714.24]  I should come to Him
[1714.24 --> 1723.54]  For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1723.54 --> 1733.10]  We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1733.10 --> 1751.00]  Jesus said, if I am lost, He will come to me.
[1751.90 --> 1760.56]  And He showed me on that cross, He will come to me.
[1760.56 --> 1770.02]  For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1770.76 --> 1779.90]  We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1779.90 --> 1790.40]  For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1790.56 --> 1799.76]  We can always come to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1799.76 --> 1805.76]  Jesus strong and kind.
[1805.76 --> 1819.46]  For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and day and night.
[1819.46 --> 1825.92]  Okay, children ages 3 to 5 are welcome to kids' life at this time.
[1849.46 --> 1857.20]  All right, good morning to you all.
[1857.78 --> 1860.42]  It's nice to see you here this morning.
[1861.02 --> 1867.02]  So we are in the second week of a six-week series, and it's a series that we're calling
[1867.02 --> 1869.00]  A Vision for Renewal.
[1869.52 --> 1875.06]  And the reason we're doing this series is that we recently, as a church, adopted a new
[1875.06 --> 1876.72]  vision statement for our church.
[1876.72 --> 1880.02]  And so our vision statement as a church family is this.
[1880.70 --> 1889.64]  We believe that Doug, there it is, we believe that we are called together for the renewal
[1889.64 --> 1892.40]  of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1892.60 --> 1893.38]  Will you say it with me?
[1894.12 --> 1899.12]  Called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1899.54 --> 1905.18]  So this is our common vision for our life and our ministry here at Ladner CRC.
[1905.18 --> 1912.04]  Last week, we started out by focusing on that last phrase, through Jesus Christ.
[1912.24 --> 1913.58]  Put it back up there for us.
[1915.08 --> 1917.40]  Yeah, so that last part, through Jesus Christ.
[1917.46 --> 1918.84]  And that's what we focused on last week.
[1919.30 --> 1924.38]  And we said that this is the most important part of our vision statement.
[1924.38 --> 1932.14]  Because the Bible tells us that the gospel, which is the good news that God is renewing and restoring
[1932.14 --> 1937.22]  this beautiful but broken world, all of this is centered on Jesus Christ.
[1938.02 --> 1940.52]  He is the center of it all.
[1940.64 --> 1944.92]  He is the center of who we are, of what we do, and of the gospel itself.
[1944.92 --> 1951.88]  So now what I want to do in the remaining weeks is consider the first part of our vision statement,
[1952.40 --> 1955.94]  that we are called together for the renewal of all things.
[1957.10 --> 1963.22]  And to help us understand what the Bible means when it talks about the renewal of all things,
[1963.22 --> 1972.32]  I personally have found it helpful to frame it in terms of four relationships that we all have as human beings.
[1973.10 --> 1983.36]  And they are our relationship with God, with ourselves, with others, and with the created world.
[1984.22 --> 1990.82]  The gospel is about a message of how God, or how people, can be restored to God.
[1990.82 --> 1996.20]  Where we can be forgiven, each and every one of us, for our offenses.
[1997.36 --> 2001.58]  It's also a message about how we can be renewed in ourselves.
[2002.32 --> 2005.70]  Because so often we feel broken apart.
[2006.38 --> 2009.52]  We feel so alienated, even within our own hearts.
[2010.78 --> 2017.88]  It's a message also about how we can be reconciled, not only to God, but to one another in our relationships.
[2017.88 --> 2024.12]  And then also it's the beginning of the reconciliation of this beautiful, wonderful world that God has given us.
[2024.56 --> 2025.94]  And we can be a part of it.
[2026.90 --> 2034.70]  So the message is that in Jesus Christ, the creator God is beginning to renew all things.
[2034.94 --> 2040.70]  Our life with God, with ourselves, with others, and with the entire world.
[2040.70 --> 2048.00]  And so for the next few weeks, I want to consider each of these four relationships from the Bible.
[2048.90 --> 2053.50]  And what it means that in Jesus, God is renewing each of these relationships.
[2053.92 --> 2056.80]  So with this in mind, today we're going to look at the first of these.
[2057.32 --> 2061.50]  And we're going to consider what it means that we are being renewed in our relationship with God.
[2062.00 --> 2065.78]  The one for whom we were made through a life of worship.
[2065.78 --> 2071.74]  And to do that, we're going to turn to a text this morning that shows us as much as any other,
[2071.82 --> 2074.74]  the glory of what God has done for us in Jesus Christ.
[2075.32 --> 2079.60]  In a way that will, we hope, awaken us to worship.
[2080.26 --> 2083.80]  So I'm going to invite Kate and Janet to come forward to read the passage.
[2084.06 --> 2087.16]  But please open your Bibles to Romans chapter 8.
[2087.86 --> 2092.12]  That is on page 841 in your pew Bible.
[2092.12 --> 2096.76]  And we will be reading a bit different passage than what is printed in your order of worship.
[2097.06 --> 2101.70]  We'll be reading verses 1 to 4, and then 12 to 17.
[2102.02 --> 2102.66]  Okay, Romans 8.
[2102.66 --> 2118.78]  Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[2118.78 --> 2130.34]  because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[2130.70 --> 2136.92]  For what the law was powerless to do, because it was weakened by the flesh,
[2136.92 --> 2149.84]  God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.
[2149.84 --> 2163.26]  And so he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully meant in us,
[2163.66 --> 2169.44]  who do not live according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
[2169.44 --> 2182.98]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh to live according to it.
[2182.98 --> 2189.80]  For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[2189.80 --> 2198.96]  But if by the Spirit you put to death the misties of the body, you will live.
[2199.96 --> 2204.36]  For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
[2204.72 --> 2210.24]  The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again.
[2210.74 --> 2216.20]  Rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
[2216.20 --> 2219.16]  And by him we cry, Abba, Father.
[2219.68 --> 2224.46]  The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
[2225.08 --> 2230.44]  Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[2230.98 --> 2236.90]  If indeed we share his sufferings, in order that we may also share his glory.
[2246.20 --> 2247.72]  Thank you, Kate and Jana.
[2249.92 --> 2251.50]  All right, would you please join me in prayer.
[2256.00 --> 2262.40]  Guide us, O God, by your word and spirit, that in your light we may see light,
[2263.00 --> 2267.92]  in your truth find freedom, and in your will discover peace.
[2268.62 --> 2270.40]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray.
[2271.06 --> 2271.42]  Amen.
[2271.42 --> 2278.00]  So, we have been experiencing some gorgeous weather this week.
[2279.26 --> 2281.36]  Except for today it's a bit cold and rainy.
[2281.56 --> 2287.54]  But this week, have any of you gotten a chance to get outside and enjoy the weather?
[2288.26 --> 2293.12]  Maybe take a walk or just sit outside and enjoy the sun, right?
[2293.26 --> 2293.86]  It's beautiful.
[2293.86 --> 2298.54]  Well, this is kind of a spurious connection, but it got me thinking.
[2299.30 --> 2304.48]  In the fourth century, there was a young man who lived in North Africa,
[2305.14 --> 2309.14]  who was trying to make sense of his own life.
[2309.48 --> 2312.50]  Trying to make sense of his own spiritual life with God.
[2313.30 --> 2317.96]  And one day, like maybe some of us were this week, he was sitting outside in a garden.
[2317.96 --> 2324.20]  And as he was sitting there, God prompted him to open his Bible and read a passage from Romans.
[2325.02 --> 2331.08]  And God spoke to him from the Bible, and his life was forever changed.
[2331.50 --> 2332.84]  He became a Christian.
[2333.82 --> 2337.04]  This young man, we call him St. Augustine.
[2337.74 --> 2341.30]  And I want to read you the opening passage, the very first sentences,
[2342.04 --> 2345.68]  of a book that he wrote called The Confessions.
[2345.68 --> 2347.86]  So here's what he wrote.
[2349.42 --> 2353.68]  Great are you, O Lord, and greatly to be praised.
[2354.26 --> 2357.80]  Great is your power, and of your wisdom there is no end.
[2358.56 --> 2364.08]  And man, being a part of your creation, desires to praise you.
[2365.06 --> 2373.08]  For you have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.
[2373.08 --> 2390.10]  And these words are important.
[2390.10 --> 2399.54]  Because what they suggest is that human beings have hearts that are restless with desire for God.
[2400.48 --> 2405.58]  This is Augustine's basic claim about who we are as people.
[2405.80 --> 2409.76]  That God is our original desire.
[2410.26 --> 2412.58]  That God himself is our ultimate desire.
[2412.58 --> 2420.20]  He is the desire, so to speak, behind and underneath all of our other desires.
[2421.10 --> 2424.92]  And the meaning of our lives is to worship him.
[2425.40 --> 2431.14]  To seek the fulfillment of our deepest desires in a relationship with God.
[2431.80 --> 2436.16]  So that our desires are satisfied in relationship with him.
[2436.16 --> 2439.38]  And so here's my intention for us this morning.
[2440.54 --> 2447.82]  If worship feels unnatural, and we all go through times when that is the case.
[2448.68 --> 2452.42]  Or if worship has become to feel routine.
[2453.12 --> 2456.06]  And we all go through times when that is also true of us.
[2456.48 --> 2458.54]  I want to give you an opportunity this morning.
[2458.54 --> 2462.26]  I am going to give you five things that might help.
[2462.78 --> 2464.52]  Five things not to do.
[2465.28 --> 2468.16]  But five things to contemplate.
[2468.44 --> 2472.26]  Five things to help awaken us to worship.
[2473.38 --> 2476.74]  So let's consider the things that God is saying to us from Romans 8.
[2477.44 --> 2479.94]  Things that awaken us to worship.
[2480.54 --> 2483.82]  Now, this is a very full passage.
[2484.10 --> 2485.56]  We're just going to be skimming the surface.
[2486.06 --> 2487.88]  And there's a lot more we can say about this.
[2487.88 --> 2491.26]  But today, for right now, we're going to say five things.
[2492.50 --> 2495.94]  And so, I will warn you now, there will be a quiz at the end.
[2496.00 --> 2496.84]  And I'm not joking.
[2497.02 --> 2497.50]  I'm not joking.
[2497.90 --> 2500.06]  So, you gems, you have your outlines, right?
[2500.38 --> 2501.24]  Okay, so follow along.
[2501.30 --> 2504.14]  And you can write in the main points as we go.
[2504.48 --> 2505.52]  So we'll have them on the screen.
[2505.70 --> 2507.36]  You can know how to spell it by looking there.
[2507.94 --> 2508.82]  Okay, so the first one.
[2510.20 --> 2511.54]  Because I don't know how to spell condemnation.
[2512.18 --> 2513.08]  But here it is.
[2513.18 --> 2513.98]  Here's the first one.
[2514.22 --> 2515.38]  No condemnation.
[2515.38 --> 2518.76]  Romans 8, verse 1 says this.
[2519.26 --> 2526.52]  Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[2527.28 --> 2534.06]  So friends, let us be awakened to how good it is not to be under condemnation.
[2534.06 --> 2537.64]  And let's just notice some of the words here.
[2537.94 --> 2542.82]  It's not that there is just a little bit of condemnation remaining for you.
[2543.18 --> 2544.20]  It says what?
[2545.18 --> 2547.08]  No condemnation.
[2547.36 --> 2550.16]  Not even a little bit of condemnation.
[2550.16 --> 2558.30]  And it is also not there is no condemnation in like three years from now when you get your act together.
[2559.46 --> 2561.50]  It's now.
[2562.08 --> 2566.34]  There is now no condemnation.
[2566.84 --> 2567.82]  For whom?
[2568.38 --> 2570.20]  For those who are in Christ Jesus.
[2570.32 --> 2573.72]  For those who have believed in his name, who have been baptized into him.
[2573.72 --> 2579.64]  If you belong to Jesus, you woke up today in your bed.
[2580.02 --> 2580.16]  Right?
[2580.32 --> 2584.54]  Did hopefully everybody, maybe that's not sometimes the case.
[2584.86 --> 2587.86]  Today you woke up in your bed, whether it was in Ladner or in Richmond.
[2588.12 --> 2589.70]  Wherever you woke up, it was in your bed.
[2590.68 --> 2597.32]  And not only though did you wake up in your bed, but you also woke up in Christ Jesus.
[2598.16 --> 2601.48]  He is the place where you live and move and have your being.
[2601.48 --> 2605.06]  You are located in him by faith in him.
[2605.76 --> 2609.54]  And if you are in Jesus, you are not condemned.
[2610.92 --> 2614.30]  And friends, we need a verdict just like that, don't we?
[2615.10 --> 2616.08]  Not condemned.
[2616.74 --> 2627.64]  You know, we are exposed to condemnation daily from other people, from ourselves, and from the world around us.
[2627.64 --> 2632.00]  And so we need to find a place where there is no condemnation.
[2632.36 --> 2635.20]  And that place is in Christ.
[2635.76 --> 2636.58]  In Christ alone.
[2636.66 --> 2642.42]  There's no other place where we can be and live and stand than in Christ.
[2642.82 --> 2646.96]  That is where we are safe and hid and protected.
[2648.04 --> 2649.52]  And there's no condemnation in him.
[2650.32 --> 2652.62]  And, you know, it is not for us either.
[2652.92 --> 2653.58]  It's not for you.
[2653.58 --> 2656.98]  It's not for me to say if there is condemnation.
[2657.60 --> 2659.16]  That is for God to say.
[2659.84 --> 2663.28]  And he says that if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, that there is none.
[2665.26 --> 2674.02]  And so to be in Christ and then to feel condemnation is allowing yourself to forget that Jesus has taken it all for you.
[2674.02 --> 2678.76]  It is right to hate sin.
[2679.22 --> 2682.34]  To hate indwelling sin in my heart and in my actions.
[2682.98 --> 2686.20]  But it is not right to invent condemnation.
[2687.28 --> 2692.16]  There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[2692.90 --> 2698.08]  And if you really contemplate that, you have to be careful.
[2698.08 --> 2705.66]  Because if you do, you will find yourself awake to reasons to worship God.
[2706.68 --> 2711.58]  This lack of condemnation leads to humility, not self-righteousness.
[2712.00 --> 2715.36]  And it leads us to worship God, not self-worship.
[2716.82 --> 2718.80]  So what's the first reason to worship God?
[2719.58 --> 2720.28]  Gems, can you help me?
[2721.24 --> 2721.52]  Ready?
[2722.26 --> 2724.48]  No condemnation.
[2724.92 --> 2725.82]  No condemnation.
[2725.96 --> 2726.10]  Good.
[2726.10 --> 2728.14]  Here's the second one.
[2729.70 --> 2730.88]  Been set free.
[2732.16 --> 2733.92]  Now, yeah, never mind.
[2734.12 --> 2734.34]  Okay.
[2734.80 --> 2735.42]  Been set free.
[2735.58 --> 2738.16]  I was going to make a comment about American and Canadian accents.
[2738.68 --> 2740.60]  If I was Canadian, it would be like being set free, right?
[2741.00 --> 2743.14]  I'm not, my children can do it really well.
[2743.66 --> 2744.36]  Been set free.
[2745.56 --> 2750.46]  Let us be awakened to how good it is to be set free.
[2751.50 --> 2753.42]  Verse 2 tells us this.
[2753.42 --> 2762.20]  Through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[2762.62 --> 2766.24]  See, the Bible is clear that we were once slaves to the law.
[2766.94 --> 2768.88]  The law, which is a good thing.
[2769.20 --> 2774.96]  The law tells us how we are to live as God's creations in a world that God has made.
[2774.96 --> 2779.00]  It is good, but we could not keep the rules.
[2779.68 --> 2783.50]  So the law became an anvil on which we were broken in pieces.
[2783.50 --> 2788.88]  There's a poem from the 1700s that goes like this.
[2789.64 --> 2790.52]  This is a fun one.
[2792.06 --> 2792.78]  Next slide.
[2793.74 --> 2794.50]  This is what it says.
[2794.86 --> 2796.66]  Run, John, run.
[2796.84 --> 2798.76]  Not John, but any of you, you know.
[2799.66 --> 2800.50]  Put your name in there.
[2800.68 --> 2801.54]  Run, John, run.
[2801.70 --> 2805.46]  The law commands, but gives us neither feet nor hands.
[2805.92 --> 2807.90]  Far better news the gospel brings.
[2808.02 --> 2811.52]  It bids us fly and gives us wings.
[2811.52 --> 2815.98]  Run, John, run.
[2816.34 --> 2820.98]  The law commands, but gives us neither feet nor hands.
[2821.46 --> 2824.10]  Far better news the gospel brings.
[2824.40 --> 2827.58]  It bids us fly and gives us wings.
[2827.78 --> 2829.92]  Do you guys know the energy drink Red Bull?
[2831.30 --> 2832.52]  What's the slogan?
[2833.62 --> 2834.44]  It gives you wings.
[2835.02 --> 2836.50]  So the gospel is like Red Bull.
[2836.60 --> 2837.32]  It gives you wings.
[2837.74 --> 2838.68]  We will never say that again.
[2838.68 --> 2843.16]  But if that's a good connection for you, it gives you wings.
[2843.32 --> 2844.06]  It bids us fly.
[2844.16 --> 2848.60]  It tells you fly, but it doesn't, you know, in the law, it doesn't give us hands or feet
[2848.60 --> 2849.36]  with which to run.
[2849.76 --> 2850.64]  We can't do it.
[2850.82 --> 2855.02]  But the gospel says fly, but it gives you wings.
[2855.48 --> 2858.02]  It supplies all that you need to actually do it.
[2858.48 --> 2860.22]  So friends, we have been set free.
[2860.22 --> 2866.30]  Not because God has lowered the bar, not because he winks at our offenses, but because Jesus
[2866.30 --> 2870.72]  was able to live out God's law perfectly.
[2871.70 --> 2877.64]  And we have been given his perfection, his perfect record of keeping the law he gives
[2877.64 --> 2878.10]  to us.
[2879.18 --> 2884.56]  So Jesus set us free from the law that for us leads to sin and condemnation or death
[2884.56 --> 2889.22]  and condemnation because he fulfilled it perfectly for us.
[2890.22 --> 2893.04]  And because of that, he opens the doors.
[2893.22 --> 2894.44]  He opens the jail cell.
[2894.74 --> 2895.44]  We are free.
[2895.54 --> 2896.28]  We fly forth.
[2897.06 --> 2898.34]  Friends, this is why we worship.
[2898.68 --> 2902.76]  When people are set free, they don't need to pretend that they're happy.
[2902.98 --> 2905.60]  Like you're out of jail and you're like, well, I guess I better cheer up.
[2905.68 --> 2905.92]  No.
[2906.76 --> 2907.62]  You're happy.
[2907.82 --> 2908.70]  You're joyous.
[2908.76 --> 2909.28]  You're free.
[2909.28 --> 2915.54]  So if your worship feels unnatural, kind of, you know, maybe not authentic, or if it feels
[2915.54 --> 2921.22]  routine, maybe you have forgotten that you were once enslaved, but you have now been
[2921.22 --> 2921.66]  set free.
[2922.64 --> 2923.78]  So say it with me.
[2924.00 --> 2924.78]  What's the first thing?
[2925.76 --> 2927.56]  No condemnation.
[2928.50 --> 2931.40]  Number two, been set free.
[2931.72 --> 2931.96]  Good.
[2931.96 --> 2934.68]  The third reason to worship God is this.
[2935.72 --> 2937.76]  He became like us.
[2938.80 --> 2944.06]  Verse three, for what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,
[2944.40 --> 2950.20]  God did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.
[2951.20 --> 2957.76]  See, the fact that Jesus became a man and came to earth to live amongst us means a great
[2957.76 --> 2962.20]  many things, but at least it means two things that I want to mention.
[2962.86 --> 2965.92]  First, it means that we are understood.
[2966.82 --> 2967.84]  We are understood.
[2968.14 --> 2970.98]  And that is so important, that we are understood.
[2972.02 --> 2978.38]  And we are understood not just from the outside, not like the way my son John understands ants.
[2978.68 --> 2982.44]  If you want to learn some facts about ants, talk to my son John.
[2982.44 --> 2989.22]  But that is not how God understands us, not by observing us from the outside, but by becoming
[2989.22 --> 2990.46]  one of us.
[2991.12 --> 2998.02]  It is like if my son John became an ant and lived in an ant colony.
[2999.08 --> 3000.02]  He is not looking at me.
[3001.62 --> 3002.06]  Right?
[3002.36 --> 3005.80]  If you really want to understand ants, I mean, ideally, you would become an ant.
[3005.96 --> 3006.76]  You would live like one.
[3007.28 --> 3008.82]  That is what Jesus did for us.
[3009.62 --> 3011.96]  He is Emmanuel, God with us.
[3011.96 --> 3013.16]  He became a man.
[3013.72 --> 3015.02]  He lived among us.
[3015.72 --> 3016.74]  Jesus has been here.
[3016.86 --> 3018.44]  He knows us intimately.
[3019.38 --> 3023.24]  His love and compassion for us are not abstract and aloof.
[3025.40 --> 3031.68]  In worship, God can sometimes feel distant for the very simple reason that we have never
[3031.68 --> 3032.24]  seen him.
[3033.02 --> 3035.86]  But remember, he became just like us.
[3035.86 --> 3042.00]  And the second thing that the incarnation, God becoming man and dwelling among us, what
[3042.00 --> 3049.84]  it means is that our help and our hope have to come from outside of us, not from inside
[3049.84 --> 3050.40]  of us.
[3051.20 --> 3051.44]  Right?
[3051.44 --> 3057.72]  Our help, our hope for salvation, for a life with God, has to come from outside of us, not
[3057.72 --> 3058.56]  from inside of us.
[3058.90 --> 3063.24]  You and I are the problem, not the solution, just to put it plainly.
[3063.24 --> 3066.28]  That's what this text says.
[3066.28 --> 3070.84]  We were powerless to keep the law because of the weakness of our flesh.
[3071.28 --> 3072.52]  So God did.
[3072.94 --> 3073.62]  God did.
[3073.96 --> 3075.58]  By sending his own son.
[3076.86 --> 3078.20]  Friends, and this is the good news.
[3079.14 --> 3083.70]  This is why Jesus became like us, so that we might become like him.
[3083.70 --> 3091.22]  Not because of anything we did, but because of everything that God did by sending his own
[3091.22 --> 3091.48]  son.
[3092.44 --> 3093.54]  So this is why we worship.
[3094.00 --> 3094.20]  Ready?
[3094.84 --> 3095.58]  Gems, help me out.
[3096.38 --> 3098.30]  No condemnation.
[3099.00 --> 3100.98]  Been set free.
[3102.16 --> 3104.90]  He became like us.
[3105.52 --> 3105.64]  Okay.
[3106.16 --> 3112.34]  The fourth reason to worship God is that the spirit of God lives in us.
[3112.34 --> 3113.88]  Verse four.
[3114.62 --> 3120.22]  And so he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might
[3120.22 --> 3122.30]  be fully met in us.
[3123.00 --> 3127.40]  Who do not live according to the flesh, but according to the what?
[3128.34 --> 3128.88]  Spirit.
[3130.20 --> 3136.56]  See, God didn't just send his son to be among us back then in history when Jesus came and
[3136.56 --> 3136.92]  lived.
[3136.92 --> 3143.56]  But no, even more than that, he sent his very spirit to dwell with us now.
[3144.66 --> 3149.52]  Now, Romans chapter eight is an amazing chapter.
[3150.34 --> 3154.96]  And it talks about the Holy Spirit more than any other chapter in the entire Bible.
[3155.10 --> 3156.22]  And the Bible is a big book.
[3157.06 --> 3159.52]  If you want to learn about the Holy Spirit, read Romans chapter eight.
[3159.52 --> 3165.68]  And Paul says a great many things about what it means that the spirit of God lives in us.
[3166.34 --> 3171.96]  But here are just two things I want to briefly highlight right now.
[3172.82 --> 3177.24]  First, the spirit helps us overcome sin in our lives.
[3177.38 --> 3177.54]  Okay.
[3177.58 --> 3182.18]  The spirit of God in us helps us overcome sin in our lives.
[3182.18 --> 3184.20]  So look with me at verse 13.
[3184.84 --> 3185.66]  Verse 13.
[3188.10 --> 3191.94]  For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[3192.76 --> 3198.40]  But if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
[3199.36 --> 3205.50]  Paul says that if by the spirit you put to death those parts in you that are at odds with
[3205.50 --> 3207.02]  God, you will live.
[3207.02 --> 3212.80]  So we can say to ourselves and we can say to other people, God loves you.
[3213.86 --> 3217.36]  He made you with glory and goodness.
[3218.06 --> 3221.90]  But because of indwelling sin, our flesh is hostile to God.
[3222.50 --> 3226.08]  And that part of us, God has a negative regard for.
[3226.76 --> 3229.72]  And the spirit of God will help us put that part of us to death.
[3230.08 --> 3232.46]  This is the process of our whole lives called sanctification.
[3232.46 --> 3239.14]  Now, that is blasphemy to a world of expressive individualism.
[3239.42 --> 3243.62]  Where you find out what is truest within you and then live it out for everybody else to
[3243.62 --> 3245.90]  see and frankly have to deal with.
[3247.04 --> 3249.34]  But the Bible says there are parts of you.
[3249.44 --> 3251.22]  You are made in glory and goodness.
[3251.62 --> 3257.02]  But because of sin, there are parts in you and each one of us and myself included that
[3257.02 --> 3258.30]  need to be put to death daily.
[3259.06 --> 3260.46]  And this is called repentance.
[3260.46 --> 3263.94]  And the spirit living in us helps us.
[3264.00 --> 3266.04]  He doesn't leave us on our own to do this.
[3266.36 --> 3270.10]  It's not only up to us, but we do need to cooperate with the Holy Spirit.
[3271.42 --> 3277.06]  The second thing it means that the spirit of God lives in us is not only to help us put
[3277.06 --> 3280.38]  sin to death in our lives, but the Holy Spirit leads us.
[3280.66 --> 3281.68]  The Holy Spirit leads us.
[3282.24 --> 3284.62]  In verse 14, Paul says,
[3284.62 --> 3289.48]  For those who are led by the spirit of God are the children of God.
[3290.52 --> 3296.52]  That phrase, led by the spirit of God, it might bring your memory back to Matthew chapter 3.
[3297.50 --> 3299.46]  Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River.
[3299.46 --> 3302.16]  And the father speaks over him and says,
[3302.38 --> 3305.64]  This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.
[3306.36 --> 3318.64]  And then the very next verse, it says that Jesus came up out of the water and the spirit led him into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.
[3319.00 --> 3320.48]  John and Bev just came back from the wilderness.
[3320.48 --> 3324.56]  This is where the spirit led Jesus.
[3326.30 --> 3334.64]  And so we have to acknowledge that the spirits leading in your life might look like deserts and it might look like the devil.
[3336.16 --> 3341.40]  It might look like leading you into places that you would rather not go.
[3342.62 --> 3349.66]  In fact, I would argue that's exactly, by definition, one of the ways you can tell if it is the Holy Spirit leading you.
[3350.48 --> 3352.18]  And not your flesh leading you.
[3352.54 --> 3352.68]  Right?
[3352.90 --> 3355.04]  If the Holy Spirit is saying to you,
[3355.40 --> 3358.50]  Do the things that feel like death.
[3359.16 --> 3363.48]  Do the things that look like self-giving instead of self-protection.
[3363.76 --> 3369.16]  Or do the things that look like submission to God instead of autonomy from God.
[3370.66 --> 3374.40]  That's a good way to determine if you are being led by the flesh or by the spirit.
[3375.60 --> 3379.92]  And to walk with the spirit in this life is a life of worship.
[3380.48 --> 3382.24]  To be led by him.
[3383.44 --> 3386.28]  Where we desire God above all.
[3388.72 --> 3393.38]  So, let's review before our final quiz, which is coming up.
[3394.10 --> 3394.78]  Are you ready?
[3396.16 --> 3397.36]  No condemnation.
[3398.46 --> 3399.20]  Jams, you gotta help me.
[3400.98 --> 3402.26]  Been set free.
[3403.22 --> 3405.80]  He became just like us.
[3405.80 --> 3409.62]  The spirit of God lives in us.
[3410.18 --> 3410.24]  Right?
[3410.54 --> 3410.80]  Okay.
[3411.08 --> 3412.90]  Here's the last one for this morning.
[3413.10 --> 3413.66]  Number five.
[3414.34 --> 3417.42]  We are God's children.
[3418.14 --> 3418.38]  Okay?
[3418.62 --> 3419.64]  We are God's children.
[3419.64 --> 3429.26]  Now, that sounds very presumptuous to say that.
[3429.90 --> 3431.42]  We are God's children.
[3432.10 --> 3432.26]  Right?
[3432.80 --> 3436.06]  But the passage calls us God's children.
[3437.10 --> 3438.96]  Listen to what Paul says here in verse 14.
[3439.34 --> 3440.74]  Beginning in verse 15.
[3440.74 --> 3446.56]  The spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
[3446.64 --> 3448.60]  And by him we cry, Abba, Father.
[3449.24 --> 3454.90]  The spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
[3454.90 --> 3458.18]  Then I think there's one more.
[3459.32 --> 3462.16]  Now, if we are children, then we are heirs.
[3462.58 --> 3465.70]  Heirs of God, co-heirs with Christ.
[3466.92 --> 3473.90]  So, Jesus became like us so that we could become like him, namely, children of God.
[3473.90 --> 3493.72]  You and me, I, who am unworthy and weak and am a lawbreaker and an idolater, I have been made by God's grace, by his strength, by his plan, God's child.
[3495.02 --> 3496.26]  Can you believe it?
[3498.50 --> 3499.90]  Can you believe it?
[3499.90 --> 3509.20]  If you do believe it, it doesn't make sense to believe it's true, but then not to worship in gratitude.
[3509.98 --> 3511.34]  That doesn't make sense.
[3512.06 --> 3517.68]  If you believe it's true, but it doesn't lead you to worship in gratitude, that doesn't make sense.
[3518.62 --> 3520.74]  But that's how children can be, isn't it?
[3521.98 --> 3522.28]  Right?
[3522.36 --> 3526.66]  We have to be taught that we are not the center of the world.
[3526.66 --> 3532.66]  We have to learn to be grateful rather than selfish, just like we teach our children.
[3533.08 --> 3535.96]  And we, as God's children, need to be taught the same things.
[3536.46 --> 3540.24]  And we give our children good things, even though they don't quite understand.
[3541.02 --> 3542.92]  And our God is that same way with us.
[3544.04 --> 3548.00]  But the very best gift that God gives us is himself.
[3549.02 --> 3553.60]  He restores us in relationship with him by making us his children.
[3553.60 --> 3555.90]  So there you have it.
[3556.68 --> 3558.96]  Five reasons to worship God.
[3559.86 --> 3564.90]  Five things, not that we have to do, but five things to contemplate.
[3565.02 --> 3567.56]  Five things to awaken us to worship.
[3568.34 --> 3569.86]  So it's time for our quiz.
[3571.00 --> 3572.26]  What are the five?
[3572.70 --> 3573.56]  We're going to put them up here.
[3573.96 --> 3575.60]  No condemnation.
[3577.44 --> 3578.60]  Do I do the, yeah, there it is.
[3578.90 --> 3580.68]  Ben set free.
[3580.68 --> 3584.10]  He became just like us.
[3584.42 --> 3587.72]  The spirit of God lives in us.
[3588.30 --> 3590.64]  We are God's children.
[3591.48 --> 3595.98]  So children of the living God, take a deep breath.
[3596.66 --> 3600.40]  Be relieved because there is no condemnation.
[3601.22 --> 3602.94]  Not now, not ever.
[3604.22 --> 3607.06]  Children of the living God, you are no longer slaves.
[3607.06 --> 3608.60]  Lose your chains.
[3609.06 --> 3612.16]  Walk in the light, in humility, and in freedom.
[3613.28 --> 3616.22]  Brothers and sisters, we are known completely.
[3617.16 --> 3619.20]  Our Savior became just like us.
[3619.66 --> 3622.06]  So we could be fully accepted by God.
[3623.50 --> 3625.26]  You know, and we feel alone sometimes.
[3625.80 --> 3626.96]  But we are not alone.
[3627.80 --> 3631.14]  Through faith in Christ, the spirit of God lives in us.
[3631.14 --> 3632.98]  To lead us in this life.
[3633.48 --> 3635.10]  To help us to put sin to death.
[3636.36 --> 3638.42]  And we can come into God's presence.
[3638.92 --> 3641.60]  The way a much-loved child can.
[3643.08 --> 3649.60]  See, the Bible tells us that God and God alone is the one who can satisfy the deepest desires of our hearts.
[3649.90 --> 3653.02]  And in response, he calls us to worship.
[3653.02 --> 3657.60]  So I want to conclude by asking you two questions.
[3658.54 --> 3659.76]  By way of application.
[3660.88 --> 3671.08]  But first, before you answer the question, I want to plead with you not to assume that you know the answer to these questions without first praying about it.
[3671.30 --> 3674.98]  It would be all too easy to say, yeah, yeah, you know, I know.
[3675.26 --> 3675.92]  I know the answer.
[3676.36 --> 3677.06]  And I am this way.
[3677.52 --> 3677.98]  But no.
[3678.28 --> 3679.02]  Pray about it.
[3679.08 --> 3679.60]  Think about it.
[3680.10 --> 3681.28]  Okay, so here's the first question.
[3681.28 --> 3684.66]  What are you worshiping in your life?
[3685.84 --> 3687.34]  Don't jump to the answer too quickly.
[3688.34 --> 3690.16]  What are you worshiping in your life?
[3690.96 --> 3693.48]  Because every single one of us is worshiping something.
[3694.18 --> 3697.32]  Reaching out towards something in desire.
[3698.08 --> 3699.28]  We have restless hearts.
[3699.98 --> 3701.32]  We're going to reach out to something.
[3701.96 --> 3702.58]  What is it?
[3702.90 --> 3705.50]  For you right now, what is that thing?
[3708.32 --> 3709.94]  The second question is this.
[3709.94 --> 3715.04]  Can that thing really bear the weight of your desire?
[3716.60 --> 3720.58]  Does it really have the glory that you are seeking?
[3720.58 --> 3723.74]  Does it really provide you with purpose?
[3724.24 --> 3726.18]  Does it really lead you to life?
[3726.54 --> 3727.08]  Really?
[3727.32 --> 3727.74]  Does it?
[3729.60 --> 3735.70]  Friends, the way you answer these two questions will actually literally determine pretty much everything about your life.
[3736.52 --> 3742.16]  It will determine whether your restless heart will ever truly find rest.
[3742.16 --> 3749.62]  And the call of the scriptures, this day and every single day, is for us to come to God.
[3750.38 --> 3753.66]  And to recognize that he is our original desire.
[3754.02 --> 3756.14]  And to respond in worship.
[3756.90 --> 3758.82]  So let me pray that the Lord would help us.
[3758.82 --> 3764.40]  Lord, we pray, open our eyes so that we can see.
[3765.60 --> 3768.26]  Open our hearts that we can desire.
[3769.14 --> 3774.06]  And order our steps so we can walk in the ways of your commandments.
[3775.14 --> 3775.42]  Amen.
[3775.42 --> 3779.00]  All right, let's all stand.
[3779.14 --> 3783.48]  And our song of response is Holy Spirit, living breath of God.
[3783.70 --> 3784.54]  Let's all rise.
[3784.54 --> 3784.64]  Let's all rise.
[3784.64 --> 3786.64]  Let's all rise.
[3786.64 --> 3797.14]  Let's all rise.
[3797.14 --> 3800.52]  Let's all rise.
[3800.52 --> 3800.86]  Let's all rise.
[3800.86 --> 3802.74]  Let's all rise.
[3802.74 --> 3805.06]  Let's all rise.
[3805.06 --> 3812.34]  Holy Spirit, living breath of God.
[3812.34 --> 3817.78]  Breathe new life into my willing soul.
[3818.78 --> 3824.64]  With the presence of the risen Lord.
[3825.06 --> 3829.88]  To renew my heart and give me hope.
[3829.88 --> 3837.16]  Cause your will to come alive in me.
[3837.16 --> 3843.30]  Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[3843.60 --> 3848.16]  Give me passion for your glory.
[3849.16 --> 3854.60]  Holy Spirit, bring the light in me.
[3854.60 --> 3861.88]  Holy Spirit, come abide with me.
[3861.88 --> 3866.42]  May your joy be seen in all I do.
[3868.32 --> 3877.88]  Love enough to cover every sin in his taught and deed and attitude.
[3877.88 --> 3879.08]  By I do in the life of God.
[3879.08 --> 3881.66]  Bye-bye.
[3881.66 --> 3882.52]  Thank you.
[3882.52 --> 3883.38]  ol'
[3883.38 --> 3884.36]  Nice.
[3885.16 --> 3887.10]  Love enough to answer to my mouth.
[3887.10 --> 3891.78]  I'm strong as best as the path of peace.
[3892.56 --> 3897.42]  Turn my strap into words of grace.
[3897.84 --> 3902.46]  Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[3904.96 --> 3909.78]  Holy Spirit, from creation through,
[3909.78 --> 3915.48]  giving life to all that God has made.
[3916.70 --> 3921.90]  Show your power once again in all earth,
[3922.32 --> 3927.90]  cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[3929.18 --> 3933.78]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise,
[3933.78 --> 3939.78]  lead us on the road to sacrifice.
[3941.38 --> 3946.58]  Let the unity, the face of Christ,
[3947.00 --> 3952.18]  make me clear for all the world to see.
[3952.18 --> 3970.24]  Today's offering is for the gems.
[3971.30 --> 3973.36]  Girls everywhere meeting their savior
[3973.36 --> 3976.02]  is for girls grades two through seven.
[3976.98 --> 3980.50]  And the girls learn how to live God-honoring lives
[3980.50 --> 3982.74]  while having fun and making new friends.
[3983.90 --> 3987.36]  And there will be a gems slideshow during the offering.
[3987.92 --> 3989.78]  And the deacons may come forward now.
[3989.78 --> 3995.16]  God-honoring lives in the密集.
[3995.16 --> 3995.54]  Let the mostra to the chill and the Glen.
[3995.74 --> 3996.70]  !"
[3996.70 --> 4026.68]  Thank you.
[4026.70 --> 4056.68]  Thank you.
[4056.70 --> 4086.68]  Thank you.
[4086.70 --> 4116.68]  Thank you.
[4116.70 --> 4146.68]  Thank you.
[4146.70 --> 4176.68]  Thank you.
[4177.08 --> 4179.04]  Father, you know us intimately.
[4180.04 --> 4184.72]  You know those parts of us that still believe we are orphaned and fatherless.
[4184.72 --> 4198.90]  You know those parts of us that remain restless and anxious and don't rest in the life with you that has been renewed and restored to us through Christ.
[4198.90 --> 4210.00]  So, Lord, continue to work in us by your Holy Spirit, the Spirit of adoption, the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry, Abba, Father.
[4210.00 --> 4214.00]  And as your children, Lord, we bring before you our needs.
[4214.00 --> 4222.72]  For you are our dwelling place, our refuge and our fortress, our God in whom we trust.
[4222.72 --> 4230.06]  We know that you have invited us to cast all our anxieties on you because you care for us.
[4230.06 --> 4238.34]  And we know that your son, Jesus Christ, who gave himself as a ransom for all, acts as our mediator before you today.
[4238.34 --> 4243.58]  So, Lord, we lift up the city and the people of Delta to you in prayer.
[4243.58 --> 4251.44]  We thank you for the beauty and blessing of the city, even though as we also remember its brokenness.
[4251.44 --> 4259.02]  We pray, Lord, for the mental and physical health and flourishing and well-being of our neighbors.
[4259.94 --> 4270.10]  And we especially pray, O God, that your word would be preached in this place so that many people would trust in Jesus for salvation.
[4271.04 --> 4275.76]  We thank you for the gospel, which is the power of God for salvation for all who believe.
[4275.76 --> 4284.16]  We continue to remember before you our brothers and sisters who need your presence, your love, and care.
[4284.92 --> 4298.02]  We pray especially for John Van Toll, Amy Cron, Pat Bauman, Pastor Nancy, as well as many others who continue to suffer from hidden hurts and chronic pain and struggles.
[4298.86 --> 4304.82]  Lord, we pray for all those who are at home who would like to be able to get out more.
[4305.76 --> 4315.22]  Lord, would you place your healing hands upon them and strengthen them with faith in their inner being through the presence of your Holy Spirit within them.
[4316.44 --> 4321.14]  And we ask that you would help us to grieve with those who grieve.
[4321.92 --> 4327.52]  We especially pray, Lord, for the Culin family this morning, as Jana's grandmother passed away recently.
[4327.52 --> 4331.38]  And, Lord, she lived a long life, I think 95.
[4331.94 --> 4336.52]  And, Lord, she knew you, but still, Lord, we grieve because death.
[4336.74 --> 4340.00]  And we grieve because it is not the way you have made it to be.
[4340.82 --> 4344.92]  But, Lord, we thank you for the hope and the promise of resurrection life.
[4345.88 --> 4350.56]  And, Lord, we take great comfort in the salvation that you have brought to us.
[4350.56 --> 4355.24]  Father, we thank you for your faithfulness to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[4355.86 --> 4360.74]  You have sustained us day by day, week by week, and year after year.
[4361.14 --> 4362.66]  And, Lord, you continue to bless us.
[4362.70 --> 4365.12]  And we thank you especially this morning for our GEMS ministry.
[4365.80 --> 4368.74]  We thank you for each and every one of these girls.
[4369.46 --> 4374.94]  And we pray that you would cause them to grow up with strong faith and strong trust in you.
[4374.94 --> 4381.52]  We thank you for our GEMS leaders and for all they do to lead and bless our girls.
[4382.30 --> 4386.18]  We pray that we would honor you in all of our labors.
[4386.70 --> 4391.98]  And that you would continue to produce fruit beyond all that we could ask or imagine.
[4393.36 --> 4397.00]  Lord, in your light, sorry, in light of these requests,
[4397.46 --> 4401.92]  would we be a church that, as the GEMS reminded us this morning,
[4401.92 --> 4406.60]  that does justice and loves mercy and walks humbly with you, our God.
[4407.38 --> 4409.56]  May we not be complacent in this world.
[4410.62 --> 4415.92]  Help us not to forget our neighbors who need the kindness of your love and of the gospel.
[4416.32 --> 4419.48]  And help us to walk humbly with you, Lord, and not in pride.
[4420.34 --> 4422.22]  We come to you, Father, for your grace.
[4422.94 --> 4427.30]  And we pray all these things to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4428.36 --> 4428.72]  Amen.
[4428.72 --> 4432.00]  Let's all stand.
[4434.68 --> 4438.84]  And again, thank you for being here with us and worshiping the Lord together.
[4439.24 --> 4444.56]  And we do, again, invite you to a time of fellowship right after the service in our fellowship hall.
[4445.28 --> 4451.26]  And please, all of us, let's greet those who we may not know or may have not met before.
[4451.76 --> 4455.50]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4455.50 --> 4464.40]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now and forever.
[4465.10 --> 4465.44]  Amen.
[4465.88 --> 4466.96]  Please remain standing.
[4467.08 --> 4468.30]  We'll sing our final song.
[4468.30 --> 4484.60]  We receive your blessing.
[4484.60 --> 4487.14]  We receive your grace.
[4487.14 --> 4492.78]  As we walk in love shining from your face.
[4492.78 --> 4498.02]  May the peace that you live change the way that we live.
[4498.02 --> 4506.22]  We receive your blessing as we live this place.
[4506.22 --> 4536.20]  We receive your grace.
[4536.22 --> 4537.22]  We receive your grace.
[4537.22 --> 4538.02]  We receive your grace.
[4538.02 --> 4540.86]  We receive your grace.
[4540.86 --> 4546.20]  May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4546.20 --> 4554.78]  We receive your blessing as we live this place.
[4554.78 --> 4556.88]  May we receive our blessing and remain on the Son of Man's gryve.
[4556.88 --> 4561.46]  Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[4561.46 --> 4567.20]  Praise Him, all creatures can dwell.
[4567.20 --> 4571.38]  Praise Him, upon the heaven we host.
[4571.50 --> 4575.22]  Praise Father, Son, and praise the Lord we host.
[4575.22 --> 4579.22]  and praise the Holy Ghost.
[4579.22 --> 4589.22]  Name is Savior, let's sing as we leave His name.
[4605.22 --> 4607.22]  Amen.
