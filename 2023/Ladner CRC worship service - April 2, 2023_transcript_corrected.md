[1.00 → 7.74] After the rainbow, the dreams are political,
[11.82 → 20.76] And one's a real style,
[25.20 → 27.76] believe in hope you can gain
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[270.00 → 299.98] Thank you.
[299.98 → 329.96] Thank you.
[329.96 → 331.20] Today is Palm Sunday.
[332.36 → 337.16] It's the beginning of what the Christian tradition calls the Holy Week.
[337.96 → 340.18] It's an up-and-down week.
[340.38 → 342.94] It starts out very happy and joyous.
[343.06 → 350.72] The people want to rejoice and praise a coming Saviour, but the week later turns very dark.
[350.72 → 355.96] And it ends, as we know, and it ends, as we know, in a bright, cheerful way.
[355.96 → 358.40] Today we sing, and it's Palm Sunday.
[358.40 → 367.40] The offering today is for the world, the world is for the world, and there's a bulletin, and there's a bulletin insert.
[367.40 → 368.40] There's a bulletin insert.
[368.40 → 369.08] Take a look at it.
[369.08 → 378.08] World Renew provides a lot of people, which is a world, which is a world, which will renew, which many of us still remember as the CRWRC, the Christian Reformed World Relief Committee,
[378.08 → 391.32] has helped partner with churches in sponsoring over 10,500 refugees to Canada.
[391.32 → 400.08] War, conflict, persecution, natural disasters are all causes for refugees to seek a better life in Canada.
[400.08 → 405.08] World Renew helps provide these opportunities for families across the world.
[405.08 → 414.08] This agency is an independent branch of our denomination, and as such is not supported by our denominational or classical quotas.
[414.08 → 417.08] Consider that as you give this morning.
[417.08 → 427.08] There are, for other announcements, there are invitations for our Easter services, Good Friday and Easter Sunday, and they're now on the foyer table.
[427.08 → 436.08] If you have friends who you know might be benefited by having one of those invitations, please take some and give them to your neighbours and friends.
[436.08 → 444.08] We've pointed out the Stations of the Cross for the last several weeks, and Elaine and I took a look at them this week.
[444.08 → 453.08] Sometimes I wonder what is art, but when Elaine and I looked at these eight different representations last week, we had no wonder at all.
[453.08 → 456.08] These are wonderful artistic expressions.
[456.08 → 460.08] They're done by eight different people from our congregation, and I encourage you.
[460.08 → 473.08] They'll still be up and available to you today, of course, and then Tuesday through Thursday this week to take a look, reflect on each one, and marvel at the quality of the images.
[473.08 → 481.08] From the Bulletin, our Seniors Luncheon is coming up April 12th.
[481.08 → 486.08] That's 10 days from now.
[486.08 → 488.08] If you're a senior, we'd like to see you there.
[488.08 → 495.08] Apparently, we'd like to also sample what kind of soup you are able to make.
[495.08 → 504.08] Cross-training sessions, the session begins two weeks from now on April 16th.
[504.08 → 507.08] So that will be meeting at 9.30 in the social hall.
[507.08 → 510.08] Take a look at the brochure for that cross-training session.
[510.08 → 512.08] It's in your mailbox this morning, too.
[512.08 → 518.08] Sign-ups for both cross-training and the Seniors Luncheon are on the foyer table.
[518.08 → 523.08] I also point out that we have this documentary on Tuesday evening called Shakoes.
[523.08 → 525.08] I think that's the pronunciation for it.
[525.08 → 527.08] Read your bulletin today.
[527.08 → 537.08] It's a remarkable tale that we would like to hear something about, and it's closely related to, you know, two members of our congregation, Fowl and Violet.
[537.08 → 539.08] So I encourage you.
[539.08 → 542.08] I think it's 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening.
[542.08 → 546.08] Will you please stand if you're able?
[546.08 → 560.08] Our call to worship is based on Zechariah 9 and Psalm 118.
[560.08 → 563.08] Rejoice greatly, O people of Zion.
[563.08 → 566.08] Shout in triumph, O people of Jerusalem.
[566.08 → 569.08] Look, your king is coming to you.
[569.08 → 575.08] He is righteous and victorious, yet he is humble, riding on a donkey's colt.
[575.08 → 579.08] And blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.
[579.08 → 583.08] You are our God, and we will praise you.
[583.08 → 587.08] You are our God, and we will exalt you.
[587.08 → 591.08] O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
[591.08 → 595.08] His faithful love endures forever.
[595.08 → 597.08] Remain standing.
[597.08 → 599.08] Oh, by cheering of society.
[599.08 → 601.08] Read in this language, O people of the world
[601.08 → 603.08] � of prayer.
[603.08 → 605.08] I will praise you for my final prayer.
[605.08 → 607.08] illegal encore MD, they're a saint.
[607.08 → 637.06] Thank you.
[637.08 → 667.06] Thank you.
[667.08 → 669.08] Thank you.
[697.08 → 699.08] Thank you.
[727.08 → 729.08] Thank you.
[729.08 → 731.08] Thank you.
[731.08 → 733.08] Thank you.
[733.08 → 735.08] Thank you.
[735.08 → 737.08] Thank you.
[737.08 → 739.08] Thank you.
[739.08 → 741.08] Thank you.
[741.08 → 745.08] Thank you.
[745.08 → 747.08] Thank you.
[747.08 → 749.08] Thank you.
[749.08 → 753.08] Thank you.
[753.08 → 781.80] We hadn't worked out the exact timing.
[783.08 → 810.58] I know I look forward to that.
[810.58 → 822.58] All right, will you join me in an opening prayer of adoration?
[822.58 → 852.58] 
[852.58 → 854.58] Amen.
[854.58 → 857.58] The Lord's greeting comes to us from the words of Jude,
[857.58 → 861.38] to those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father
[861.38 → 863.46] and kept safe for Jesus Christ,
[863.64 → 867.90] may mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[868.58 → 871.66] Please turn around and welcome someone around you this morning.
[871.66 → 883.66] Thank you.
[883.66 → 885.66] Thank you.
[885.66 → 889.66] Thank you.
[889.66 → 891.66] Thank you.
[891.66 → 895.66] Thank you.
[895.66 → 901.66] Thank you.
[901.66 → 905.66] Thank you.
[905.66 → 915.66] Thank you.
[915.66 → 917.66] Thank you.
[917.66 → 919.66] Thank you.
[919.66 → 921.66] Thank you.
[921.66 → 923.66] Thank you.
[923.66 → 924.66] Thank you.
[924.66 → 926.66] Thank you.
[926.66 → 929.66] Thank you.
[929.66 → 933.66] Thank you.
[933.66 → 938.66] Thank you.
[938.66 → 946.72] My Jesus, my Saviour, though there is none of you,
[946.72 → 957.76] follow my days, my rock to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[958.90 → 966.72] My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength,
[966.72 → 977.08] let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[978.36 → 987.92] Shout to the Lord, all the earth that I sing, power and majesty, praise to the King.
[987.92 → 997.88] Mountains bow down, and the seas will roar and the sound of your name.
[998.44 → 1008.04] I sing for joy in the work of your hands, forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[1008.60 → 1014.52] Nothing compares to the promise I am in you.
[1014.52 → 1028.16] Oh, Jesus, my Saviour, though there is none like you,
[1028.16 → 1039.56] all of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[1039.56 → 1049.52] My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength,
[1049.52 → 1059.56] let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[1059.56 → 1071.72] Shout to the Lord, all the earth that I sing, power and majesty, praise to the King.
[1072.32 → 1081.56] Mountains bow down, and the seas will roar and the sound of your name.
[1081.56 → 1091.56] I sing for joy in the work of your hands, forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[1092.80 → 1097.32] Nothing compares to the promise I am.
[1097.32 → 1102.52] Nothing compares to the promise I am.
[1102.52 → 1109.56] Nothing compares to the promise I am in you.
[1109.56 → 1135.36] Nothing compares to the Lord, all that I am.
[1135.36 → 1141.36] The Word of God the Father from before the world began.
[1142.02 → 1149.34] Every star and every planet has been fashioned by your hand.
[1149.82 → 1157.20] All creation holds together by the power of your voice.
[1157.20 → 1160.68] Let the skies declare your glory.
[1161.22 → 1164.90] Let the land and seas rejoice.
[1164.90 → 1168.24] You're the author of creation.
[1168.92 → 1171.78] You're the Lord of everyone.
[1172.58 → 1178.92] And your cry of love rings out across the land.
[1180.70 → 1184.36] Yet you left the gaze of angels.
[1184.70 → 1188.32] Came to seek and save the lost.
[1188.32 → 1191.92] And exchange the joy of heaven.
[1191.92 → 1195.78] For the anguish of a cross.
[1195.94 → 1199.30] With a prayer you fed the hungry.
[1199.90 → 1203.02] With a word you calmed the sea.
[1203.70 → 1206.56] Yet how silently you suffer.
[1207.26 → 1210.44] That the guilty may go free.
[1210.44 → 1214.40] You're the author of creation.
[1214.40 → 1217.82] You're the Lord of everyone.
[1217.82 → 1225.16] And your cry of love rings out across the land.
[1225.16 → 1230.62] With a shout you rose victorious.
[1230.62 → 1234.56] Rest in victory from the grave.
[1234.56 → 1238.30] And ascended into heaven.
[1238.30 → 1242.16] Leading captives in your way.
[1242.16 → 1245.58] Now you stand before the Father.
[1246.18 → 1249.66] Interceding for your own.
[1249.66 → 1253.08] From each tribe and tongue and nation.
[1253.08 → 1257.10] You are leading sinners home.
[1257.10 → 1260.40] You're the author of creation.
[1260.40 → 1263.82] You're the Lord of everyone.
[1263.82 → 1270.82] And your cry of love rings out across the land.
[1270.82 → 1281.58] You may be seated.
[1287.84 → 1290.50] In our time of confession and assurance.
[1291.16 → 1292.76] Hear these words of confession.
[1293.74 → 1294.96] They're like a prayer.
[1295.16 → 1298.10] But they're essentially directed to our God in heaven.
[1298.10 → 1302.34] Loving God you rode a donkey and came in peace.
[1302.34 → 1305.68] Humbled yourself and gave yourself for us.
[1305.68 → 1308.48] We confess our lack of humility.
[1308.48 → 1313.20] As you entered Jerusalem the crowd shouted Hosanna.
[1313.20 → 1314.58] Save us now.
[1316.04 → 1318.72] But by Good Friday they shouted crucify.
[1319.58 → 1322.84] We too confess that our praise is sometimes empty.
[1323.46 → 1326.72] As the crowd laid their palm leaves in front of you.
[1326.72 → 1328.28] You took the way of God.
[1328.38 → 1328.92] The difficult.
[1329.50 → 1331.44] You took no glory for yourself.
[1332.48 → 1335.80] We confess we often want to take the easy way.
[1336.34 → 1338.72] We often do not stay true to your will.
[1340.54 → 1341.64] Forgive us Lord.
[1341.84 → 1344.84] And help us to follow in the way of obedience.
[1350.76 → 1352.06] Our assurance of pardon.
[1352.16 → 1354.64] Hear the words of the Lord from Psalm 118.
[1356.72 → 1358.50] Let those who fear the Lord say.
[1358.50 → 1361.32] His steadfast love endures forever.
[1361.76 → 1364.46] Out of my distress I called on the Lord.
[1364.96 → 1367.50] The Lord answered me and set me free.
[1367.88 → 1370.02] The Lord is my strength and my song.
[1370.48 → 1372.14] He has become my salvation.
[1372.76 → 1373.76] I shall not die.
[1374.52 → 1377.72] But I shall live and recount the deeds of the Lord.
[1378.10 → 1380.12] In Christ we are forgiven.
[1380.76 → 1381.94] Thanks be to God.
[1381.94 → 1386.12] We sing Christ is mine forevermore.
[1386.22 → 1387.36] 殂 so well.
[1387.36 → 1417.34] . . .
[1417.34 → 1447.32] . . .
[1447.34 → 1455.64] Mine are tears in times of sorrow, darkness not yet understood.
[1456.72 → 1464.76] Through the valley I must travel, where I see no earthly good.
[1464.76 → 1472.76] But mine is peace that flows from heaven, and the strength in times of need.
[1473.68 → 1481.76] I know my pain will not be wasted, Christ completes his work in me.
[1481.76 → 1491.76] . . .
[1491.76 → 1501.76] . . .
[1501.76 → 1511.76] . . .
[1511.76 → 1513.76] . . . .
[1513.76 → 1523.76] . . .
[1523.76 → 1525.76] . . . .
[1525.76 → 1526.76] . . . . .
[1526.76 → 1527.76] . . . .
[1527.76 → 1536.76] . . . .
[1536.76 → 1537.76] . . . .
[1537.76 → 1538.76] . . . .
[1538.76 → 1547.76] . . . .
[1547.76 → 1548.76] . . . .
[1548.76 → 1549.76] . . .
[1549.76 → 1551.76] . . .
[1551.76 → 1552.76] . . .
[1552.76 → 1561.76] . . .
[1561.76 → 1562.76] . . . .
[1562.76 → 1564.86] and hope is sure.
[1565.34 → 1569.22] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1569.70 → 1573.36] Come rejoice now, O my soul,
[1573.36 → 1577.82] for his love is my reward.
[1578.24 → 1582.06] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[1582.50 → 1586.72] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1586.72 → 1592.80] In my heart east to Zion City,
[1592.80 → 1596.98] where beside the King I roared,
[1596.98 → 1601.36] for there my heart has found its treasure.
[1601.92 → 1606.06] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1606.48 → 1610.92] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1611.38 → 1615.68] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1616.72 → 1619.88] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1619.88 → 1621.84] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1621.84 → 1626.04] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1626.04 → 1629.18] If there are any children still remaining here,
[1629.40 → 1633.80] ages three to grade five are dismissed for King's life.
[1646.72 → 1653.04] Hello there.
[1654.18 → 1658.74] Today I'll be reading Malachi 3, 6-12.
[1658.74 → 1661.28] I, the Lord, do not change,
[1661.78 → 1663.96] so you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.
[1664.72 → 1666.34] Ever since the time of your ancestors,
[1666.34 → 1668.06] you have turned away from my decrees
[1668.06 → 1670.04] and have not kept them.
[1670.54 → 1672.82] Return to me, and I will return to you,
[1673.48 → 1674.22] says the Lord Almighty.
[1674.22 → 1677.60] But you ask, how are we to return?
[1678.38 → 1680.94] Will a mere mortal rob God?
[1681.38 → 1682.12] Yet you rob me.
[1682.76 → 1684.70] But you ask, how are we robbing you?
[1685.76 → 1686.88] In tithes and offerings.
[1687.88 → 1690.48] You are under a curse, your whole nation,
[1690.66 → 1691.60] because you are robbing me.
[1692.46 → 1694.66] Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse,
[1694.74 → 1696.22] that there may be food in my house.
[1697.02 → 1698.26] Test me in this, says the Lord,
[1698.26 → 1701.58] and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven
[1701.58 → 1703.54] and pour out so much blessing
[1703.54 → 1706.34] that there will not be enough room for enough to store it.
[1707.46 → 1708.40] I will prevail.
[1709.14 → 1711.64] I will prevent pests from devouring your crops,
[1712.20 → 1714.92] and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit
[1714.92 → 1716.44] before it is ripe, says the Lord Almighty.
[1717.26 → 1718.78] Then all the nations will call you blessed,
[1719.22 → 1720.14] for yours is a nation.
[1720.50 → 1721.76] Yours will be a delightful land,
[1721.76 → 1722.60] says the Lord Almighty.
[1728.26 → 1738.74] Good morning.
[1739.70 → 1741.04] Thank you, Joel, for reading.
[1741.52 → 1744.96] It's good to see Roger on the piano again after a while.
[1745.12 → 1745.44] Thank you.
[1747.48 → 1749.06] Let's come before the Lord in prayer
[1749.06 → 1750.90] as we open up his word today.
[1753.16 → 1755.90] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[1755.90 → 1760.34] Lord, we thank you that your word reveals to us who you are.
[1761.56 → 1763.88] And Lord, what good news, what hope
[1763.88 → 1766.70] that you have made yourself known to us.
[1768.28 → 1772.50] And Lord, your word applies to every area of our lives.
[1773.28 → 1774.66] And Lord, you are our creator.
[1774.80 → 1777.86] You know us even better than we know ourselves.
[1779.04 → 1782.58] And so we pray that your word would now speak to our hearts.
[1783.02 → 1785.86] Lord, open up our hearts, challenge our hearts.
[1786.52 → 1788.80] But also, Lord, lead us to the hope of the gospel.
[1789.84 → 1792.52] We pray for your Holy Spirit now to be our teacher
[1792.52 → 1793.26] through your word.
[1793.86 → 1795.40] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1797.06 → 1799.44] So we, as many of you will know,
[1799.52 → 1801.14] are in the church season of Lent.
[1801.70 → 1803.38] And during the season, we have been studying
[1803.38 → 1805.70] the book of Malachi, as has been said.
[1805.82 → 1807.42] And I want to encourage you,
[1807.42 → 1809.16] you can see the page number in the bulletin,
[1809.30 → 1811.24] to have the text open in front of you
[1811.24 → 1813.28] as we look at it together.
[1813.28 → 1816.62] And as you heard it read, perhaps you noticed
[1816.62 → 1821.48] that the topic of today is money.
[1822.56 → 1823.42] And you might think,
[1823.52 → 1826.86] why did I bring a friend to church today?
[1829.24 → 1832.52] Notice, what month is this?
[1832.52 → 1834.66] April.
[1835.42 → 1837.96] Are we toward the end of our budget year?
[1838.66 → 1839.46] We're not.
[1840.14 → 1842.38] So that's not why we're having this discussion.
[1843.04 → 1844.26] But we're talking about money today
[1844.26 → 1845.62] because Malachi talks about it.
[1846.38 → 1847.76] And so this is our passage for today.
[1848.42 → 1850.60] And we preach through the Bible as much as we can.
[1850.68 → 1852.42] And so we take it as it comes.
[1852.42 → 1855.84] And the Lord wants to say something to us about money.
[1856.56 → 1858.26] Now, there are many proverbs,
[1858.90 → 1860.68] many sayings that relate to money
[1860.68 → 1861.94] that we have in our culture.
[1863.18 → 1866.94] So see if you can fill in some of these blanks.
[1867.78 → 1868.26] Okay, ready?
[1869.60 → 1872.24] A penny saved, I almost gave it away.
[1872.50 → 1875.38] A penny saved is a penny earned.
[1875.38 → 1879.08] Money can't buy happiness.
[1879.76 → 1880.74] The Beatles saying,
[1881.58 → 1883.74] can't buy me love.
[1884.36 → 1887.26] A fool and his money are soon parted.
[1887.98 → 1890.82] Money doesn't grow on trees.
[1891.58 → 1894.96] Something I heard pretty often growing up from my parents is,
[1895.44 → 1898.28] does it look like we have a money tree growing in our backyard?
[1898.98 → 1901.44] Because I like to spend money when I was a kid.
[1902.00 → 1902.68] Probably still do.
[1902.68 → 1908.70] So we have lots of things that we say about money in our world.
[1908.84 → 1911.82] Lots of little lessons we want to pass on to our children
[1911.82 → 1915.30] about what money is and what it does.
[1915.56 → 1918.00] What money can buy, what money can't buy.
[1918.86 → 1920.62] But the question today is a little bit different.
[1921.76 → 1925.92] How does our financial lives relate to our spiritual lives?
[1926.66 → 1930.48] Or to what extent does God care about what we do with our money?
[1930.48 → 1938.04] As God, through the prophet Malachi, speaks to his people today in this passage about their lives,
[1938.56 → 1943.80] he does so because he knows how important money is.
[1945.02 → 1947.82] And God cares about how we use our money.
[1948.40 → 1954.72] Because in fact, their love of money is keeping them from God.
[1954.72 → 1961.32] They're not ready to return to God because their financial lives are not in order.
[1961.48 → 1966.38] So God speaks to them, and he calls them to return to him.
[1967.74 → 1976.22] And so my hope for us this morning is to see that what we do with our money really does matter to God.
[1976.28 → 1981.40] Not so much because God wants our money, but because God wants our hearts.
[1982.06 → 1983.16] God wants our hearts.
[1983.16 → 1988.12] And so I want to make just two simple observations from today's text
[1988.12 → 1991.50] about the spiritual discipline of giving.
[1992.62 → 1996.10] And I'm going to give these points to you as we go along.
[1996.16 → 1997.14] There's just two observations.
[1997.56 → 2000.26] And then I want to conclude with some applications.
[2000.54 → 2001.06] So get ready.
[2001.92 → 2005.68] So two observations for us this morning from Malachi.
[2005.68 → 2007.72] And the first one is this.
[2008.14 → 2013.18] That giving is bringing to God what's already his.
[2014.64 → 2018.52] Giving is bringing to God what is already his.
[2019.18 → 2024.18] And this is actually one of the most startling aspects of this passage.
[2024.38 → 2025.82] So look with me at verse 8.
[2026.34 → 2031.00] So actually, you know, often I like to move through a passage starting from verse to top and moving down.
[2031.00 → 2033.16] We're going a little bit reverse order today.
[2033.28 → 2034.72] So we're going to be in verse 8 first.
[2036.12 → 2036.86] Look at verse 8.
[2037.42 → 2040.84] Will a mere mortal rob God?
[2041.66 → 2045.46] Yet you rob me.
[2046.18 → 2047.44] God speaking here.
[2047.90 → 2048.84] You rob me.
[2048.84 → 2054.70] Now, this word robs in Hebrew is a very harsh word.
[2055.44 → 2058.90] It literally means to take by force.
[2059.74 → 2064.22] And so it has its connotations of plundering or of armed robbery.
[2065.26 → 2066.54] Maybe you can picture it this way.
[2067.10 → 2069.94] Imagine God has a big basket.
[2070.78 → 2071.42] Big basket.
[2071.42 → 2078.36] And in his basket are all the world's goods, all the world's resources and wealth.
[2078.82 → 2080.14] And it is all his.
[2080.56 → 2081.64] He owns it all.
[2081.90 → 2082.84] He has it all.
[2083.26 → 2084.54] It's all there in his basket.
[2085.52 → 2090.54] And this idea that everything belongs to God is something that we see throughout the Bible.
[2091.42 → 2094.68] So Psalm 50 verses 10 to 12 say this.
[2094.68 → 2101.84] For every animal of the forest is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills.
[2102.36 → 2106.82] I know every bird in the mountains and the insects in the fields are mine.
[2107.04 → 2109.12] If I were hungry, I will not tell you.
[2109.30 → 2113.08] For the world is mine and all that is in it.
[2113.58 → 2114.54] It's an amazing passage.
[2114.64 → 2117.50] I love to think about the actual, the birds, the animals, the insects.
[2117.68 → 2120.32] God says, they all belong to me.
[2121.28 → 2123.72] And God says, if I were hungry, I would not tell you.
[2123.72 → 2127.64] In other words, God doesn't need anything from us.
[2128.40 → 2129.54] He is self-sufficient.
[2130.02 → 2134.28] He's not waiting for us to give to him because he owns everything.
[2135.24 → 2137.76] And it's very important to recognize and underscore this.
[2138.04 → 2143.18] Because it's easy for us to fall into this trap of thinking that even though God has given us everything,
[2143.88 → 2149.18] that somehow he needs us or relies on us, our tithes, our giving of money, to him.
[2149.94 → 2151.94] God doesn't actually need anything from us.
[2151.94 → 2153.76] It all belongs to him.
[2154.52 → 2157.52] Or look at one more passage, Psalm 24, verse 1.
[2159.26 → 2166.48] The earth is the Lord's and everything in it, the world and all who live in it.
[2167.32 → 2170.00] Everything in the entire universe belongs to God.
[2170.62 → 2171.80] You belong to God.
[2171.80 → 2173.78] Your life belongs to God.
[2173.78 → 2177.02] Every dollar you ever get belongs to God.
[2177.54 → 2179.24] Every house you ever live in.
[2180.32 → 2182.38] Every meal you have ever eaten.
[2182.90 → 2184.48] Every gift you've ever given.
[2184.68 → 2186.86] Every day you wake up and are alive.
[2187.52 → 2190.16] Every experience you ever have.
[2190.58 → 2193.76] All of it is in God's sovereign hands.
[2193.76 → 2196.40] And for his purposes.
[2197.30 → 2199.02] All treasure belongs to him.
[2199.84 → 2202.84] And he gives generously, doesn't he?
[2203.38 → 2205.72] He gives us all things so generously.
[2206.76 → 2209.04] But here in Malachi, God says,
[2209.48 → 2212.26] You people of Israel, you're robbing me.
[2213.26 → 2215.68] You're coming along, and you're reaching into this basket.
[2216.00 → 2217.60] And you're wrenching things away.
[2217.70 → 2219.30] You're forcibly taking things out.
[2219.30 → 2221.64] Taking things that don't belong to you.
[2221.94 → 2223.20] Things I haven't given you.
[2223.98 → 2230.78] And it's kind of crazy to think, to talk, about mere mortals robbing God.
[2231.48 → 2235.88] Which is why in verse 8, the people, they ask this question.
[2236.42 → 2239.16] But you ask, how are we robbing you?
[2240.28 → 2241.50] And God responds.
[2242.20 → 2244.02] In tithes and offerings.
[2244.50 → 2249.22] You are under a curse, your whole nation, because you are robbing me.
[2250.10 → 2253.86] So God says here, the way people are robbing him is how?
[2254.54 → 2258.50] They are withholding tithes and offerings.
[2259.30 → 2263.22] They're withholding the tithes that the Levitical law commanded them to bring.
[2264.20 → 2272.42] So they weren't actually sneaking into God's house and stealing his TV or stealing his laptop or something like that.
[2272.74 → 2276.06] They were failing to give God the tithe.
[2276.06 → 2280.72] And the people were saying, how are we robbing you?
[2280.80 → 2280.94] Right?
[2280.96 → 2282.54] They don't think they were doing anything wrong.
[2282.62 → 2283.64] They didn't realize.
[2284.24 → 2289.30] It wasn't, they weren't aware of this fact that withholding the tithe was, in God's eyes, robbing him.
[2289.30 → 2292.32] And I think we often think the same way.
[2293.18 → 2298.24] You know, in our culture, when we think about money, we talk about money.
[2298.60 → 2300.24] Money is very personal.
[2301.12 → 2303.50] And it is a very individual thing.
[2304.46 → 2308.98] So we might think, you know, it's a pretty normal thing for us to say, I might give.
[2309.44 → 2310.64] I might not give.
[2311.52 → 2313.58] And for us, there's nothing wrong with that.
[2313.64 → 2314.94] After all, it's my money.
[2315.44 → 2315.66] Right?
[2315.66 → 2317.38] I can do whatever I want with it.
[2318.08 → 2321.12] But God is saying to us that not giving is an act of robbery.
[2322.04 → 2327.26] We're taking what belongs to God, and we're keeping it for ourselves.
[2329.04 → 2331.32] So God here talks about the tithe.
[2331.46 → 2333.00] And so what is the tithe?
[2333.00 → 2337.60] Well, literally in the Bible, the tithe just means a tenth.
[2338.64 → 2341.72] And this is an ancient practice in the Bible to give a tenth.
[2342.00 → 2344.16] The first time we see it in Scripture is in Genesis.
[2344.92 → 2353.30] Abraham offers a tenth or a tithe to Melchizedek, who is this priest and king of the Most High God.
[2354.06 → 2357.24] And then later in Genesis, Jacob, he has this encounter with God.
[2357.32 → 2360.34] His life is completely changed by this encounter with God.
[2360.34 → 2363.48] And he says, I'm going to give the Lord a tenth.
[2364.52 → 2369.14] Now, it's important to note that in both of those cases, it was a voluntary offering.
[2369.66 → 2370.40] It wasn't commanded.
[2370.62 → 2377.36] But throughout the Old Testament later, the people of Israel were commanded in the law of God
[2377.36 → 2381.16] to give back to God one-tenth of everything that the land produces.
[2381.98 → 2389.32] So if you are a barley farmer, and you grow a bunch of barley, you give 10% of your barley to God.
[2390.34 → 2394.34] If you grow olives, and you make oil, you give a tenth of the oil to God.
[2394.64 → 2398.20] And these tithes, they were used for three purposes.
[2399.10 → 2403.26] First, they supported the priests who worked in the temple and supported their families.
[2403.68 → 2407.98] Because the priests, the Levites, the tribe of Levi, they didn't have a portion of the land.
[2407.98 → 2415.12] And so the tithe was to provide for them so that they can focus on serving God in the temple.
[2416.70 → 2421.54] Tithes, secondly, were used for a number of annual feasts and festivals and celebrations.
[2421.54 → 2426.64] So people would bring their food, their oil, their wine, and they'd have a big party.
[2427.02 → 2429.68] And there would be these feasts that would be dedicated to God.
[2430.22 → 2431.52] And the tithes were used for that.
[2431.98 → 2434.58] And then they were also, thirdly, used for relief of the poor.
[2435.74 → 2438.16] And even here in verse 10, God says this.
[2438.62 → 2443.98] God says, bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house.
[2445.10 → 2445.34] Right?
[2445.42 → 2446.46] This is God's house.
[2446.90 → 2450.84] And he wants it full of food because he wants people to be able to come to him,
[2450.84 → 2455.68] to come to the house of God and be cared for, to be fed who need it.
[2455.68 → 2465.12] But because the people weren't giving the whole tithe, the people that should be cared for with that money were not being cared for.
[2466.62 → 2473.96] And so failing to tithe here is not only an act of violence, plundering God, it's also an act of injustice.
[2474.64 → 2476.08] It's withholding from the poor.
[2476.08 → 2482.94] So all of Israel was supposed to bring a tithe to God.
[2484.00 → 2486.84] These tithes were the expectation for God's people.
[2487.84 → 2493.24] And really not just an expectation, but because if they were withheld, God says it constitutes robbery.
[2494.46 → 2501.56] And what we learn here about money from Malachi is that there's a very different mindset for the people of God when it comes to their wealth.
[2501.56 → 2513.06] Malachi says you shouldn't begin by picturing everything as belonging to you, and then you give God back a little bit, you know, just so he'll be happy.
[2513.84 → 2514.10] No.
[2514.88 → 2518.48] The biblical mindset is you begin by picturing everything belongs to God.
[2519.16 → 2525.02] And if you withhold from God more than what he has allotted to you, then you are robbing him.
[2526.04 → 2527.80] You know, most of us, though, begin the first way.
[2527.80 → 2532.60] You know, I have my monthly salary, however much it is, and it all belongs to me.
[2533.34 → 2537.60] And out of my money, we say I will give this much to God.
[2538.82 → 2540.16] That's where most of us begin.
[2540.28 → 2542.48] We begin with us, and we work back to God.
[2543.18 → 2545.28] But the biblical mindset is the reverse.
[2545.74 → 2555.82] Everything belongs to God, and we are given what we have to steward for our use what remains after the tithe, which we are to give to him.
[2555.82 → 2559.72] So that's the first observation we see here about giving.
[2560.26 → 2564.22] All of it belongs to God, and he gives all things generously to us.
[2564.94 → 2568.30] But he expects us to be givers as well.
[2569.14 → 2573.34] He is the great giver, and he expects us as his people to be givers.
[2573.96 → 2579.06] He doesn't need us to help, but he offers us to participate in his kingdom.
[2580.40 → 2581.88] Now, that's the first thing.
[2581.88 → 2588.74] So the second thing we see in this text is that giving heals our heart's relationship with money.
[2589.54 → 2592.00] Giving heals our heart's relationship with money.
[2592.66 → 2600.08] So the problem in Israel is that by not giving away their tithes and offerings, the people are running away from God.
[2600.84 → 2602.64] And that's what God says here in verse 7.
[2603.44 → 2604.22] He says this.
[2604.22 → 2610.80] Ever since the time of your ancestors, you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them.
[2611.38 → 2615.04] Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord Almighty.
[2616.36 → 2617.50] Okay, so here's the thing.
[2618.72 → 2627.44] God isn't concerned so much about the lack of a tithe as he is what withholding the tithe is doing to people's hearts.
[2627.44 → 2633.62] And with all the things that God could have addressed with his people and calling them to return to him,
[2634.34 → 2636.98] you know, he has already dealt with all these other issues with God.
[2637.04 → 2642.94] He could have picked so many things, so many ways that the people are not following him in their hearts and in their lives.
[2643.00 → 2650.16] But God says, it's your willingness to give that shows me that you're really returning to me in your hearts.
[2650.58 → 2651.84] It's your willingness to give.
[2651.84 → 2657.70] And you know, Jesus says something very, very similar, doesn't he, in the New Testament.
[2658.32 → 2660.70] Look with me at Luke 22, verse 34.
[2662.28 → 2667.84] Jesus says, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[2668.98 → 2675.28] Okay, so there's this sense, Jesus says, in which your money and your heart are very linked together.
[2675.28 → 2682.98] And whatever it is that you love most, that's where you will invest your money and your resources.
[2684.56 → 2689.48] Then in Matthew 6, 24, Jesus goes so far even to say this.
[2690.08 → 2691.74] No one can serve two masters.
[2691.90 → 2696.74] Either he will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[2696.84 → 2699.04] You cannot serve both God and money.
[2699.80 → 2704.72] So Jesus here talks about money as a sort of competitor God.
[2705.28 → 2714.26] And he says, you actually have money, and you have God as two things that you can serve in worship.
[2716.20 → 2719.76] And Jesus says, you can't serve them both.
[2720.76 → 2725.64] You will either love and worship God and you will invest your money in God's kingdom,
[2726.04 → 2729.86] or you will love and worship money, and you will invest in your own kingdom.
[2729.86 → 2738.50] And in our day as well, the primary competitor to Jesus in the world right now, it isn't other religions.
[2739.14 → 2739.94] It's money.
[2740.68 → 2741.40] It's possessions.
[2741.78 → 2742.54] It's materialism.
[2742.54 → 2743.54] It's materialism.
[2743.54 → 2744.54] It's materialism.
[2744.54 → 2751.28] That's what is the master of our hearts, often more so than Jesus is.
[2752.56 → 2758.52] And what that tells us is that when God's people withhold the tithe from them in a very tangible way,
[2758.88 → 2761.54] they are withholding their hearts from him.
[2762.86 → 2769.34] It's very kind of putting what you believe into practice, putting your money where your mouth is.
[2769.34 → 2771.28] Do you believe in God?
[2771.32 → 2772.10] Do you trust in him?
[2773.18 → 2774.80] Or are you withholding?
[2774.98 → 2777.76] And it's very much tied to our hearts and our trust in God.
[2778.52 → 2782.08] So now, so that leads us to the question, well, why would Israel do this, right?
[2782.08 → 2784.04] Why wouldn't they just bring the whole tithe?
[2784.16 → 2785.40] It was commanded in the law.
[2786.28 → 2787.36] Why wouldn't they do that?
[2788.34 → 2789.72] Why are they withholding the tithe?
[2789.72 → 2797.70] Well, you know, we might imagine Israel had some good reasons, good excuses for withholding the tithe from God.
[2798.88 → 2804.70] Historically, in Malachi's day, times were hard, right?
[2804.80 → 2807.10] They weren't in a season of prosperity.
[2807.44 → 2810.14] In fact, they were actually in a season of poverty.
[2810.14 → 2822.84] And from our texts, it seems to suggest that there was a drought, that there was pestilence, you know, bugs, rats, whatever, deer maybe, eating the crops.
[2823.68 → 2826.16] And just generally, the land wasn't being productive.
[2827.20 → 2831.82] So perhaps many of the people were just trying to get by, right?
[2831.84 → 2834.20] And to give a tenth of their produce seemed like too much.
[2834.20 → 2838.80] They felt they need to keep some back to provide for their own security.
[2840.68 → 2844.58] Maybe some of the people were giving less because they were worried about the future.
[2845.54 → 2848.00] You know, who knows what's going to happen next year?
[2848.48 → 2851.24] Maybe the Persians will increase their taxes over us.
[2851.94 → 2853.60] Maybe things will get even worse.
[2854.20 → 2859.52] So we better save what we can so that we have protection against whatever comes.
[2859.52 → 2866.32] Or maybe some people were giving less because they wanted to go on that Mediterranean beachside vacation.
[2866.56 → 2868.58] You know, it's very beautiful that time of year.
[2868.74 → 2869.06] I don't know.
[2870.06 → 2876.00] Maybe they thought money can give me a sense of pleasure or happiness, delight in my life.
[2876.04 → 2880.62] And if I have enough of it, I can spend it on the things I want me to think will make me happy.
[2882.10 → 2885.22] Other people maybe thought, if I give this money, it's a waste.
[2885.76 → 2888.20] You know, why are we having these festivals, these celebrations?
[2888.20 → 2889.72] It's too extravagant.
[2890.94 → 2893.36] Or maybe they said, why are we giving our money to the poor?
[2893.46 → 2894.76] They should just be working harder.
[2895.66 → 2895.78] Right?
[2895.82 → 2900.44] So all of these things, they probably had lots of reasons that people could think of, that we could think of,
[2900.74 → 2903.64] for why they were failing to give God his tithe.
[2904.48 → 2907.90] But whatever it is, if you think about these things we mentioned, right?
[2908.32 → 2912.92] Security, protection, pleasure, happiness, delight.
[2912.92 → 2917.18] Those are things that only God can ultimately give us.
[2918.14 → 2918.22] Right?
[2918.30 → 2920.24] Those are only things that can come from God.
[2921.10 → 2927.10] And when we look to money to give us security, and we look to money to give us protection and safety,
[2927.66 → 2934.06] those things that only God can give, we are treating money like a competitor to God.
[2934.44 → 2935.86] Like what Jesus talks about.
[2935.86 → 2941.08] So whatever excuses they are telling themselves for not giving, it sort of doesn't matter.
[2941.76 → 2948.44] Because the deeper issue behind all of these reasons, what's really going on, is that they weren't trusting God.
[2949.22 → 2953.20] They weren't looking to him to give them what they needed and what they desired.
[2953.20 → 2963.88] And if they were to surrender the tithe, it would put them in a position of dependency on a God who they don't think even cares about them.
[2966.96 → 2970.80] And let's face it, we are not beyond this either.
[2971.80 → 2974.44] Many of us, we struggle when it comes to giving to God.
[2975.28 → 2976.74] And we justify it, right?
[2976.78 → 2979.44] We say, well, if I give 10%, I won't be able to save.
[2979.44 → 2985.02] And if I don't have a good balance in my savings account, what will happen when something goes wrong?
[2986.16 → 2989.84] So you don't give because you want to save, and you have a fear of what might happen in the future.
[2990.80 → 2995.28] Or some of us, we say, I can't give because I won't have any money left over for myself.
[2995.70 → 2998.44] I won't be able to enjoy life the way I want to enjoy it.
[3000.26 → 3003.88] Or others might say, I just can't afford to give.
[3003.88 → 3011.94] But what you're actually saying is, I can't afford to re-examine my life, to make room in my life to give from what I have.
[3012.60 → 3014.26] Maybe making some sacrifices.
[3015.18 → 3018.22] You know, I don't want to bear the cost or the inconvenience of that.
[3019.44 → 3020.84] And so we withhold our money.
[3021.36 → 3022.76] And we keep it for ourselves.
[3023.54 → 3024.52] And we all do this.
[3024.84 → 3025.52] Myself included.
[3026.18 → 3027.78] In a variety of ways.
[3027.78 → 3032.90] But underneath all of these reasons that we have, there is a simple truth.
[3033.52 → 3036.66] We're not really sure if we can trust God.
[3037.98 → 3045.18] And when we keep our giving to ourselves, like Israel, we keep our hearts to ourselves.
[3045.18 → 3053.42] And that's why God says something very important to us in verse 6.
[3053.90 → 3054.78] Look at verse 6.
[3055.60 → 3058.72] He says, I, the Lord, do not change.
[3059.10 → 3061.96] So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.
[3063.16 → 3069.38] This is an amazing thing for God to remind us of in the context of talking about money.
[3069.38 → 3078.12] You know, Israel at this time, it had been about a thousand years since they had come into the promised land.
[3078.26 → 3079.96] They've been in that land for a thousand years.
[3080.80 → 3082.74] And the Assyrians have come through.
[3083.16 → 3084.68] And the Babylonians have come through.
[3084.74 → 3085.72] And the Persians have come.
[3085.98 → 3088.44] And God says, look, you are still alive.
[3089.16 → 3090.10] You are not destroyed.
[3090.72 → 3092.66] You have not been consumed by these nations.
[3093.30 → 3094.44] I have protected you.
[3094.52 → 3097.28] And I have been with your century after century.
[3097.56 → 3098.62] I do not change.
[3098.62 → 3101.84] My faithfulness to you does not change.
[3102.30 → 3106.00] I am faithful to my covenant promises to my people.
[3107.20 → 3111.02] So God calls his people, look, I am faithful.
[3111.36 → 3112.28] I do not change.
[3112.64 → 3113.84] Return to me.
[3114.62 → 3116.04] Trust in my faithfulness.
[3116.32 → 3122.10] Look to me to care for you, to provide for you, to be satisfied in me.
[3122.10 → 3132.16] And giving their tithes open-handedly, God says, is a very tangible way that we stop worrying about how we're going to provide for ourselves.
[3132.60 → 3135.94] And we step out in faith and say, God, I am going to trust in you.
[3136.36 → 3138.06] God, I know that you are faithful.
[3138.36 → 3145.02] And I am going to depend on you and not on how much money I have for my happiness and for my security.
[3145.02 → 3149.26] Tithing is never about our wallets.
[3149.88 → 3151.22] It's about our hearts.
[3152.52 → 3158.00] And in Malachi's day, God promised to pour out a blessing on his people if they would return to him.
[3159.98 → 3164.32] He says, first, I want you to exercise your faith in me.
[3164.32 → 3171.44] Bring the whole tithe into my storehouse and then watch how I prove myself faithful to you.
[3171.50 → 3172.28] Look at verse 10.
[3173.92 → 3177.84] Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house.
[3178.00 → 3180.00] Test me in this, says the Lord.
[3180.06 → 3181.52] You know, normally we're not supposed to test God.
[3182.80 → 3185.54] God says here, test me in this.
[3185.54 → 3194.80] See if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will be not enough room to store it.
[3197.44 → 3198.64] Did the people do that?
[3200.16 → 3200.84] They didn't.
[3201.90 → 3205.12] They never truly returned to God.
[3205.58 → 3207.10] This is the last book in the Old Testament.
[3208.24 → 3209.66] God keeps saying, return to me.
[3211.16 → 3213.38] In your hearts, in your lives, return to me.
[3213.38 → 3215.58] They never return to God.
[3216.68 → 3219.94] Their relationship with him was never healed.
[3221.12 → 3222.50] But God never changes.
[3223.16 → 3223.90] God is faithful.
[3224.06 → 3225.24] He is faithful to his covenant.
[3225.72 → 3228.84] And because his people don't end up returning to him,
[3229.44 → 3237.22] God eventually would open up the windows of heaven and pour out the ultimate blessing in the giving of his son, Jesus Christ.
[3238.44 → 3241.32] John 3.16 famously says,
[3241.32 → 3244.02] God so loved the world that he did what?
[3245.00 → 3246.84] He gave.
[3247.68 → 3250.06] He gave his one and only son.
[3250.76 → 3253.80] That whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
[3254.80 → 3258.10] And when Jesus came, Jesus was the rich one.
[3258.60 → 3261.02] He was the prince of heaven.
[3261.40 → 3263.72] He was, he owned the cosmos.
[3264.76 → 3266.24] He is the heir of all things.
[3266.32 → 3267.38] He made all things.
[3267.76 → 3269.74] All things belong to him.
[3269.74 → 3272.66] And yet, he emptied himself.
[3272.84 → 3274.86] He became poor for our sakes.
[3275.56 → 3277.26] He let go of his wealth.
[3278.14 → 3285.24] He became a babe in a manger, born into a poor village, to a poor family,
[3285.42 → 3290.02] so that we could share in the richest of his blessings.
[3290.02 → 3293.78] So Paul says in 2 Corinthians 8.9,
[3293.78 → 3301.42] For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor,
[3301.88 → 3306.90] so that you, through his poverty, might become rich.
[3306.90 → 3313.40] God in Christ pours down a blessing that is far beyond our faithfulness.
[3314.40 → 3321.88] And we receive the blessing, not because we are faithful, not because we've trusted in God,
[3322.44 → 3325.40] that we brought all the tithe into the storehouse.
[3325.50 → 3326.30] No, we haven't.
[3326.30 → 3330.96] But he has poured out his blessing upon us because he is faithful.
[3332.08 → 3334.90] And it's on the cross that we see the lengths that God will go to,
[3335.34 → 3340.74] to call back his people whose hearts are trusting more in money than in him.
[3340.74 → 3348.16] So for those of us who struggle with looking to money to give us what only God can provide,
[3349.06 → 3353.80] for those of us who have not treated God as God in our financial lives,
[3354.60 → 3355.92] Christ died for that too.
[3356.96 → 3362.92] He died, and he rose so that he might then make us his people who are free,
[3363.62 → 3367.70] who are provided for, who are generous, and who are joyful.
[3367.70 → 3372.32] Now I want to move into some application.
[3373.38 → 3375.90] Because, you know, we're looking at Malachi, and that's in the Old Testament,
[3376.04 → 3378.76] and we're talking about the tithe, and that was Old Testament.
[3379.48 → 3382.50] But how does this apply to Christians today?
[3383.94 → 3386.64] Is it sinful for Christians to refuse to give?
[3387.28 → 3391.06] Or at what point does a lack of giving become sinful, right?
[3391.10 → 3392.80] Is it 5%? Is it 3%?
[3392.80 → 3399.48] I think I saw the average of evangelical Christians in North America is like giving is 3%.
[3399.48 → 3402.10] Is it 10%?
[3403.46 → 3406.28] Right? Before or after taxes, right? That's the real question.
[3407.60 → 3409.14] What if you can't feed your family?
[3410.32 → 3413.46] Right? There are a lot of questions we have about giving.
[3413.68 → 3415.96] And so here are a couple of things to think about.
[3415.96 → 3421.08] First, giving a tithe is not commanded in the New Testament.
[3422.62 → 3425.08] Okay? You don't, you're not commanded to give a tithe.
[3426.34 → 3430.26] We are no longer under the ceremonial law, the Levitical law.
[3430.90 → 3437.00] Most Christians, well, we don't own agricultural land in Israel.
[3437.70 → 3438.14] Right?
[3439.00 → 3441.26] And, I mean, do some of you? I don't know.
[3442.30 → 3450.34] But also, Hebrews 8 discontinued the mandatory tithe because the Levitical priesthood no longer exists.
[3450.80 → 3452.48] And Jesus is our great high priest.
[3453.34 → 3454.36] So it's all obsolete.
[3455.26 → 3460.00] So when it comes to the New Testament teaching about giving, rather than a command to give 10%,
[3460.00 → 3462.56] we get some general guidelines.
[3462.56 → 3468.72] So I wanted to just mention briefly three guidelines that we see in the New Testament about giving.
[3469.02 → 3472.08] First guideline is that our giving should be proportional.
[3473.50 → 3477.56] In 1 Corinthians 16.2, Paul's writing to the church in Corinth, and he says,
[3477.70 → 3479.94] on the first day of the week, that's Sunday,
[3481.42 → 3486.24] each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income.
[3487.28 → 3488.62] So how much should you give?
[3489.72 → 3492.32] Paul says, give according to your income.
[3493.06 → 3493.80] Give proportionally.
[3495.50 → 3496.50] That's one guideline.
[3498.00 → 3502.46] Second guideline is that giving should be sacrificial.
[3502.66 → 3503.10] The next one.
[3504.40 → 3506.18] So 2 Corinthians 8.3, 1-3.
[3506.34 → 3510.94] In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty
[3510.94 → 3513.40] welled up in rich generosity.
[3513.40 → 3520.18] For I testify that they gave as much as they were able and even beyond their ability.
[3520.18 → 3520.68] Right?
[3520.68 → 3524.68] So what was happening is that the church in Jerusalem was struggling.
[3524.86 → 3526.50] They were going through this severe trial.
[3527.02 → 3532.90] The churches around the Roman Empire were taking up a collection to aid their brothers and sisters in Jerusalem.
[3532.90 → 3540.00] Paul says the church of Macedonia, in their extreme poverty, were rich in generosity.
[3540.70 → 3542.62] Going beyond their ability.
[3542.80 → 3550.44] And Paul praises them for their sacrificial giving because it is a response to God's own generosity toward them.
[3550.44 → 3551.44] Okay?
[3551.44 → 3557.46] And so the third guideline then for giving is that it should be joyful.
[3558.90 → 3560.24] 2 Corinthians 9.7.
[3560.24 → 3566.50] Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly, not under compulsion,
[3567.34 → 3569.28] for God loves the cheerful giver.
[3570.18 → 3571.56] So how much should we give?
[3572.62 → 3576.04] All the New Testament writers are like, I'm not going to tell you a specific.
[3576.82 → 3577.06] Right?
[3577.22 → 3578.50] We don't have specifics.
[3579.18 → 3580.84] We have guidelines.
[3581.56 → 3587.78] Now the practice throughout the history of the church has often used 10% as a good kind of gauge,
[3588.12 → 3589.44] but it's not required.
[3590.24 → 3591.32] We're told to be generous.
[3591.72 → 3593.74] As generous as God has been toward us.
[3594.48 → 3595.86] We are told to be sacrificial.
[3595.98 → 3598.08] As sacrificial as Christ has been toward us.
[3598.96 → 3604.46] And so learning to give generously comes from being captured by Jesus' generosity toward us.
[3604.66 → 3611.66] And just becoming and saying, I want my life, I want my money, I want everything to be about more people
[3611.66 → 3614.92] experiencing the generosity of God through Jesus Christ.
[3615.22 → 3617.10] I want more people to experience that.
[3617.10 → 3621.50] And so I give to the work of God's kingdom in this world.
[3622.62 → 3627.52] And so the plea of this passage this morning is not just, could you change your spending habits a little bit?
[3627.52 → 3635.56] No, the plea of this passage is return to God, who loves you, and who is generous with you.
[3636.48 → 3641.62] See, God cares about your giving, not because God needs it, but because you need it.
[3641.62 → 3647.90] And in a very real way, through our giving, we begin to trust in God.
[3648.44 → 3649.76] We prove him to be faithful.
[3650.38 → 3654.32] And we begin to experience ourselves that he is faithful.
[3654.32 → 3656.08] Okay, let's pray together.
[3658.64 → 3669.02] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for passages like this that point to the grand, the extravagant, the lavish love and grace
[3669.02 → 3673.70] that you have poured so richly upon us in Jesus Christ.
[3673.70 → 3680.88] Paul says in Ephesians that in Christ we have every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[3682.40 → 3684.60] Father, you have forgiven us of our sins.
[3684.72 → 3686.22] You have risen us to new life.
[3686.68 → 3687.74] You have seated us in heaven.
[3687.86 → 3689.04] You have given us the church.
[3689.62 → 3691.72] You have given us so many things.
[3693.30 → 3696.26] And Lord, we want our hearts to be shaped by your heart.
[3696.26 → 3701.50] And so, Lord, would you make us generous like you, our Heavenly Father, is generous.
[3702.10 → 3709.50] And Lord, would you then fill your storehouse so that the church could be your light and your salt in this world,
[3710.02 → 3715.40] that we might feed the poor, that we might share the gospel far and wide.
[3715.86 → 3717.46] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[3718.10 → 3718.36] Amen.
[3720.74 → 3721.46] Let's stand.
[3721.72 → 3723.24] Let's sing our song of response together.
[3723.82 → 3725.20] What shall I render to the Lord?
[3726.26 → 3750.66] What shall I render to the Lord?
[3750.66 → 3756.80] For all is bad and is to be?
[3756.80 → 3762.66] How shall my life, my grace restores?
[3763.78 → 3770.66] Give word with thanks, O Lord, to thee?
[3770.66 → 3772.66] Salvation, O Lord, to thee?
[3772.66 → 3773.66] Salvation, O Lord, to thee?
[3773.66 → 3774.66] Salvation, O Lord, to thee?
[3774.66 → 3775.66] Salvation, O Lord, to thee?
[3775.66 → 3776.66] O Lord, to thee?
[3776.66 → 3777.66] Salvation, O Lord, to thee?
[3777.66 → 3780.66] I take and call upon God's name.
[3780.66 → 3782.66] Before his saints, I pray by thou.
[3782.66 → 3784.66] And hear thy gratitude proclaim.
[3784.66 → 3790.66] Before his saints, I pray by thou.
[3790.66 → 3796.66] And hear thy gratitude proclaim.
[3796.66 → 3805.66] With thankful heart I offer now.
[3805.66 → 3806.66] By gift and call upon God's name.
[3806.66 → 3812.66] I lift and call upon God's name.

[3828.66 → 3831.66] Within his house, the house of prayer.
[3831.66 → 3833.66] I dedicate myself to God.
[3833.66 → 3834.66] Let all his saints, his praise declares.
[3834.66 → 3835.66] And join to sound his praise abroad.
[3835.66 → 3836.66] Let all his saints, his praise declares.

[3991.66 → 3999.20] Please join me in prayer as we pray for the needs of our congregation and of our city
[3999.20 → 4002.66] and of the world.
[4002.66 → 4007.68] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love and grace that allows us to enjoy your special
[4007.68 → 4010.98] presence here in our gathered worship.
[4010.98 → 4017.42] Lord, we believe because your word tells us that where two or three are gathered in your
[4017.42 → 4020.80] name, there you are in the midst of us.
[4020.80 → 4026.66] And so fully relying on your son's completed work of salvation and his intercession for
[4026.66 → 4034.30] us, we boldly come to your throne to present our petitions and our prayers before you.
[4034.30 → 4039.46] God our healer, we pray for members of our own congregation with health needs.
[4039.46 → 4043.02] Lord, we especially pray for John Van Toll.
[4043.02 → 4045.34] We pray for Ted.
[4045.34 → 4053.92] Lord, we pray for Amy as she continues her cancer treatments.
[4053.92 → 4059.22] Lord we pray that you continue to heal Pastor Nancy, help her to fully recover, regain her
[4059.22 → 4060.22] strength.
[4060.22 → 4064.22] Lord, continue to be with Jordan as he goes through cancer treatments.
[4064.22 → 4070.10] Lord, would you through those treatments, Lord, heal his body completely of cancer.
[4070.10 → 4072.10] Lord, we pray for Grace.
[4072.10 → 4077.78] Lord, we pray for Katrine as she is home but is still recovering.
[4077.78 → 4084.16] We pray for Pat Barman, Lord, as she just has faced so many struggles health wise.
[4084.16 → 4087.78] Lord, would you help her to continue to recover.
[4087.78 → 4093.34] Lord, we pray for Elaine.
[4093.34 → 4094.34] We pray for Shirley.
[4094.34 → 4097.34] Lord, we pray for so many people who need your healing.
[4097.34 → 4101.34] Lord, you are the one who has sustained them until now.
[4101.34 → 4105.90] Lord, would you continue to be with them with your healing love.
[4105.90 → 4113.90] Lord, in your mercy, have mercy on those of us who are caught up in sin.
[4113.90 → 4119.58] Lord, you know all the ways that we are tempted because you were tempted as we were yet without
[4119.58 → 4120.58] sin.
[4120.58 → 4125.78] So, Lord, bring us to the full realization of your love that your love is better than life.
[4125.78 → 4131.34] If your love is better than any of the false promises that sin entices us with.
[4131.34 → 4137.54] And Lord, cause us to return to you in our hearts.
[4137.54 → 4142.34] Faithful God, we pray for those who feel isolated, afraid, and overwhelmed.
[4142.34 → 4148.34] Lord, who are confused and struggling to walk with you by faith.
[4148.34 → 4152.22] Lord, allow us to see how faithful you are in our lives.
[4152.22 → 4159.98] Despite even sometimes, Lord, when you walk with us through dark valleys.
[4159.98 → 4165.30] We pray that all parents in our church might be blessed, Lord, with all the wisdom and all
[4165.30 → 4167.60] the knowledge that comes from you.
[4167.60 → 4173.56] To raise up the covenant children given to them, Lord, with love and care.
[4173.56 → 4179.22] May these children grow in grace and cling to Christ as they mature with a deep love for
[4179.22 → 4181.22] God and neighbour.
[4181.22 → 4188.50] Lord, raise up a generation who can powerfully testify of your love in your saving power through
[4188.50 → 4192.42] Christ our Lord.
[4192.42 → 4198.98] God of true reconciliation, we pray for those who have wandered from the life of faith.
[4198.98 → 4205.04] Whether Lord, they be children or grandchildren, friends or neighbours.
[4205.04 → 4210.32] Lord, may the faithful love of God through Christ who died for them in us, bring them to a true
[4210.32 → 4218.24] conviction of the Father's crying heart for reconciliation with us as wayward sinners.
[4218.24 → 4223.52] Father, we are thankful for your blessings upon our church ministries.
[4223.52 → 4229.44] Lord, these ministries that help us to lift our hearts to you and to refocus our lives on you.
[4229.44 → 4232.72] Lord, would you fill our hearts with the joy of the Lord.
[4232.72 → 4240.64] Lord, bless our leaders and our ministries that we might share your love far and wide and that your love may fill our hearts to
[4240.64 → 4245.04] sanctify us and cause us to grow more and more into the image of Jesus our Lord.
[4245.04 → 4251.84] Father, in this time now we also pray for other churches in our city of Ladder.
[4251.84 → 4264.32] Father, we pray for Lighthouse, for Cedar Park, Ladder Baptist, Life Church, Gospel Assembly, the Lutheran Church, the Anglican Church, the United Church and many others.
[4264.32 → 4269.20] May your holy name be continually praised through the preaching of the gospel.
[4269.20 → 4274.28] Lord, strengthen their ministry to proclaim the Father's heart to our community.
[4275.28 → 4280.88] And we pray for all the leadership, the pastors, elders, other leaders of the church, that you would bless them.
[4280.88 → 4289.60] That by your Holy Spirit, with wisdom, strong faith and perseverance in their labours, Lord, that you would be with them.
[4291.44 → 4299.64] Father, we pray for our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, for BC Premier, David By, and Lord, our local government leaders.
[4300.76 → 4304.12] We proclaim Jesus as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[4305.12 → 4308.48] And please, Lord, help these elected leaders to fear the true King.
[4308.48 → 4312.04] And guide them to make righteous decisions before you.
[4313.30 → 4317.24] And Lord, finally, may our hearts be aligned with yours in all things.
[4318.34 → 4326.54] Lord, give us your compassion and your courage to serve you and to live for you in every area of our lives, including our financial lives.
[4327.38 → 4331.08] And may your kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4331.08 → 4341.80] And we pray all these things before your throne in the strong name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who died and who is risen.
[4342.76 → 4345.28] We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4345.28 → 4348.14] Let's stand.
[4348.14 → 4352.22] And we go from here with the Father's blessing upon us.
[4352.92 → 4356.62] This Friday is our Good Friday worship service.
[4356.88 → 4365.32] Here, Friday at 1030, we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper, which we will not do in Easter, which is our normal time to celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[4365.32 → 4367.98] So, Lord's Supper is on Friday, not Sunday.
[4368.12 → 4375.58] On Sunday, we're hoping, if they pass their interviews, that we will have many baptisms from our Chinese ministry.
[4375.96 → 4377.50] So, that's something to look forward to on Sunday.
[4379.28 → 4382.20] Again, please join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall.
[4382.60 → 4388.30] I invite you to hold out your hands and receive this word of blessing from our Heavenly Father, who says to us this.
[4388.86 → 4390.32] I want to read from 2 Corinthians.
[4390.32 → 4402.26] God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
[4402.88 → 4405.78] As it is written, he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor.
[4406.60 → 4409.06] His righteousness endures forever.
[4409.98 → 4410.30] Amen.
[4420.32 → 4438.24] He is exalted, the King is exalted on Christ.
[4438.24 → 4440.40] I praise Him.
[4440.66 → 4443.98] He is exalted, forever exalted.
[4444.30 → 4449.24] And I will praise His name.
[4450.32 → 4480.30] He is exalted.
[4480.30 → 4484.72] He is exalted, forever exalted.
[4484.98 → 4490.30] And I will praise His name.
[4492.30 → 4499.32] He is exalted, forever His truth shall reign.
[4499.80 → 4506.76] Heaven and earth rejoice in His holy name.
[4506.76 → 4508.76] He is exalted, forever exalted.
[4508.76 → 4512.76] He is exalted, the King is exalted on Christ.
[4512.76 → 4517.40] God is who he, who is Christ.
[4517.40 → 4518.76] God раз MER city for the holy name.
[4518.76 → 4519.34] God bless him.
[4519.34 → 4522.76] What also surrender have saints minutes may cease.
[4522.76 → 4524.00] God bless you.
[4526.22 → 4528.46] God bless you.
[4529.34 → 4530.00] God bless you.
[4530.08 → 4530.82] God bless you.
[4530.84 → 4531.82] God bless you.
[4532.04 → 4532.44] God bless you.
[4532.44 → 4533.30] God bless you.
[4533.44 → 4536.02] God bless you.
[4536.02 → 4566.00] Thank you.
