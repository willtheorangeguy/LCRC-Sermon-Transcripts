[1319.72 → 1349.72] Thank you.
[1349.72 → 1379.70] Thank you.
[1379.70 → 1409.68] Thank you.
[1409.70 → 1439.70] Christ.
[1439.70 → 1469.68] There's a river.
[1469.68 → 1499.66] Thank you.
[1499.66 → 1529.64] Thank you.
[1529.66 → 1559.64] Thank you.
[1559.66 → 1589.64] Thank you.
[1589.64 → 1596.64] Amen.
[1596.64 → 1626.62] You may be seated.
[1626.62 → 1656.60] Malachi 1.
[1656.60 → 1686.58] Thank you.
[1686.58 → 1716.56] Thank you.
[1716.56 → 1746.54] Thank you.
[1746.54 → 1776.52] Give us.
[1776.52 → 1806.50] the word of the word of the work,
[1806.50 → 1812.48] So Malachi prophecies, or prophesies, that's not right, he prophesies, Malachi prophesies,
[1812.78 → 1821.40] around the year 450 BC. So in other words, Malachi is a very old, ancient document.
[1821.90 → 1827.20] But we believe in our church that even though this was written 2,500 years ago,
[1827.58 → 1834.98] the words of Malachi are God's word to us today. And so why study Malachi?
[1834.98 → 1841.74] Well, I think Malachi is helpful to us for the following ways, and I'm actually quite excited by this book.
[1842.96 → 1849.84] Malachi writes to discouraged, doubting, and even bored people of God.
[1851.28 → 1859.44] This is a post-exilic book. The people have come back to the land from their exile, the temple is being rebuilt,
[1859.44 → 1867.56] but life is not rosy. Their lives and their worship just hasn't turned out the way that they had hoped.
[1867.78 → 1874.64] Their prayers have just kind of gone unanswered. And they're going through the motions of religious practice,
[1874.90 → 1880.48] but their heart is just not in it. And so I think this is going to feel relevant to us,
[1880.48 → 1886.98] because we can be like that too sometimes. Right? Not every one of us, not all the time, of course.
[1888.28 → 1891.72] But likely many of us at some points in our Christian life,
[1891.72 → 1897.00] we will identify with the questions that God's people are asking here.
[1897.46 → 1899.96] And we need to hear God's response as well.
[1899.96 → 1905.88] So Malachi has a message from God for the people of God, and that includes us.
[1905.94 → 1910.30] God has a message for us, his people, through this book.
[1911.08 → 1913.92] God has something he wants to tell his people, and so we should pay attention.
[1915.14 → 1918.90] So what's the first thing that God wants his people Israel to know?
[1919.70 → 1920.88] Look at verse 2.
[1922.40 → 1923.12] God says,
[1924.32 → 1927.30] I have loved you, says the Lord.
[1927.30 → 1929.38] That's amazing.
[1931.14 → 1933.68] I have loved you, says the Lord.
[1936.06 → 1940.54] God is about to confront Israel with some tough messages.
[1940.98 → 1943.54] That's what we'll be rereading in the coming weeks.
[1944.16 → 1947.16] There are some issues that God needs to address with his people.
[1948.04 → 1952.66] There's some stuff they've got to deal with, that they need to work out in their relationship with each other,
[1952.72 → 1954.52] and he is going to address these things.
[1954.52 → 1960.76] And yet, for everything that God needs to say to Israel about their sin, about their unfaithfulness,
[1961.46 → 1967.78] the first thing God says is he wants to reaffirm his love for them.
[1968.66 → 1974.26] Before any issue is addressed, God reminds Israel about how much he loves them.
[1974.80 → 1981.72] In this way, he's like a good father who might need to talk to his kids about how they're behaving,
[1981.72 → 1987.54] but first he says, I love you, and that's why we need to have this kind of conversation.
[1988.60 → 1997.04] So today in Malachi chapter 1, verses 1 to 5, we will see that God loves us with an inexhaustible love.
[1997.88 → 2001.78] And yet, like Israel, we tend to respond with doubt and with questioning.
[2001.78 → 2006.18] But God, because of his grace, he engages with those questions.
[2006.34 → 2011.74] He engages with our doubts, and he responds, and he reassures us of his love.
[2012.48 → 2015.00] So this morning, we're going to look at this passage in two parts.
[2015.40 → 2018.18] First, we're going to see God's doubting people.
[2018.86 → 2022.26] And then secondly, we're going to look at God's dependable love.
[2022.26 → 2025.20] So first, let's look at God's doubting people.
[2026.48 → 2028.26] So God declares his love for them.
[2028.34 → 2033.16] He says, I have loved you, but look at Israel's response.
[2034.02 → 2044.26] Verse 2, but you ask, and is the people of God, you ask, how have you loved us?
[2045.28 → 2048.08] So this is a startling opening to the book of Malachi.
[2049.00 → 2051.84] And so there's also, we see this dialogue going on, right?
[2051.84 → 2053.74] The Lord says, I have loved you.
[2054.06 → 2056.66] And they say, well, how have you loved us?
[2057.04 → 2061.90] And much of the book of Malachi is actually these dialogues between the Lord and his people.
[2062.60 → 2065.50] And I find that it makes the book of Malachi feel very relatable.
[2066.84 → 2071.46] And so for Israel, they are asking, does God even love them?
[2072.52 → 2077.40] And to understand this response, let's take it and let's transport it to marriage.
[2077.40 → 2083.68] Imagine for a moment, a husband looking lovingly at his wife.
[2084.30 → 2090.18] She is looking beautiful one morning, and he says to her, honey, I love you.
[2091.36 → 2095.82] Now, the typical expected response would be what?
[2095.82 → 2098.52] I love you too.
[2099.38 → 2100.54] Or thanks, darling.
[2101.16 → 2103.78] Or some sort of positive response, right?
[2104.50 → 2108.88] Now imagine the husband says to his wife, I love you.
[2109.32 → 2116.72] And the wife narrows her eyes, wrinkles her brow, folds her arms and says, how have you loved me?
[2116.72 → 2117.16] Really?
[2118.36 → 2118.88] Really?
[2120.08 → 2121.86] How have you loved me?
[2122.90 → 2127.38] And you can just imagine if you're married how that response would go in your household.
[2127.50 → 2129.66] Maybe you don't have to imagine it very hard.
[2130.64 → 2132.58] It's kind of a shocking response.
[2133.40 → 2138.10] And that is exactly how Israelites, the Israelites, are responding to God.
[2138.74 → 2141.98] Their response is to doubt and to question.
[2141.98 → 2148.60] They say, okay, God, I hear you saying that you love me.
[2149.30 → 2150.92] But where is the evidence?
[2152.06 → 2153.72] We want some proof.
[2154.12 → 2155.76] Like, you know, God, words are cheap.
[2156.72 → 2160.94] Would you explain to us exactly how you love us?
[2162.38 → 2166.36] And so clearly, God's people are not feeling loved, are they?
[2167.34 → 2169.50] So where is this response coming from?
[2169.58 → 2171.54] What's kind of under their skin?
[2171.54 → 2172.64] What's bristling them?
[2174.02 → 2181.30] Well, it's probably what's causing this response is that Israel, as God's people, they have been through the ringer.
[2182.14 → 2185.72] Over and over as a nation, they have been unfaithful to God.
[2186.48 → 2187.88] And God would send them prophets.
[2188.54 → 2189.90] He would speak to them.
[2189.98 → 2191.06] He would send them warnings.
[2191.78 → 2195.60] God would continue to call his people to return to him.
[2196.22 → 2199.84] But they, over and over, just refused.
[2199.84 → 2204.92] And after many attempts, God finally, he sent them into exile in Babylon.
[2205.46 → 2206.74] The Babylonians came.
[2207.04 → 2209.10] They took the people of Judah into exile.
[2209.44 → 2213.34] They destroyed the capital city, the holy city of Jerusalem.
[2213.34 → 2216.96] They destroyed the temple in the year 587 BC.
[2216.96 → 2232.58] And the Israelites spent 70 years out of the promised land, away from their homes, torn out from their land, their families, their homes, in a foreign country for 70 years.
[2232.58 → 2237.30] And then 70 years later, the Lord brought them back to their homeland.
[2237.30 → 2239.04] They brought them back to the land of Judah.
[2240.04 → 2241.84] The Israelites, they were already gone, right?
[2241.90 → 2243.52] The northern kingdom of Israel.
[2244.62 → 2246.28] They were in the southern kingdom of Judah.
[2246.72 → 2248.10] God brought them back to the land.
[2248.10 → 2249.36] And so they come back from exile.
[2249.36 → 2254.08] They are here, back in the land, about 100 years later now.
[2254.64 → 2255.84] They're back home.
[2256.04 → 2257.16] And they're looking around.
[2258.00 → 2260.70] And things are not going well.
[2261.12 → 2262.50] Things are actually pretty awful.
[2263.22 → 2264.08] They look around.
[2264.20 → 2267.52] And it just seems like God is not interested anymore.
[2267.52 → 2273.06] They look at the temple, the place they're supposed to encounter the presence of God.
[2274.32 → 2275.76] And it is in disrepair.
[2276.74 → 2279.52] They look for a king that God is supposed to provide.
[2279.96 → 2281.46] And it is not to be found.
[2281.92 → 2285.38] They are now under the power of the Persians, a different foreign power.
[2286.42 → 2289.06] They look for prosperity in the land.
[2289.14 → 2290.96] And instead, there is economic decline.
[2291.06 → 2291.92] The crops are failing.
[2292.34 → 2295.14] Agriculture is suffering from pests and plagues.
[2295.14 → 2299.12] And so the people of Israel are looking at their circumstances.
[2299.62 → 2304.62] And they're saying to themselves, surely if God loved us, things would be different.
[2306.24 → 2311.82] And I think a lot of us feel that way about God sometimes too.
[2312.96 → 2314.98] We read of God's love in the Bible.
[2315.36 → 2317.22] We hear him say, I love you.
[2317.32 → 2322.12] But we look around at our lives, and we're like, where is the evidence?
[2322.12 → 2328.52] And I think if we're honest, we're not that much different from the people of Israel.
[2329.72 → 2333.68] Sometimes we wonder, well, in what ways have you loved us, God?
[2334.50 → 2340.84] You know, I became a Christian and I had this picture in my mind of how God was going to love me,
[2340.88 → 2342.08] of what that would look like.
[2342.60 → 2346.26] But it hasn't gone according to my plans of what I was picturing.
[2346.26 → 2354.04] You know, maybe you look at your finances, or you look at your family life or your medical diagnosis or whatever it is,
[2354.06 → 2359.66] and you look at these circumstances, and you start to question, God, how have you loved me?
[2361.04 → 2367.82] And under the scorching heat of life circumstances and challenges, it can feel like God's love evaporates.
[2368.88 → 2369.60] Where is it?
[2369.60 → 2378.06] And then sometimes our questions turn into accusations, like, God, you haven't loved me.
[2379.26 → 2383.54] And then over time, these accusations, they actually turn into conclusions.
[2384.04 → 2386.12] God, if you did love me, things were to be different.
[2386.46 → 2389.02] Obviously, you don't.
[2391.82 → 2395.40] I think we can empathize then with the people of Israel.
[2395.68 → 2397.46] We get where they're coming from.
[2397.46 → 2401.92] They don't believe that God loves them because of what they've been through
[2401.92 → 2405.10] and because of what their lives currently look like.
[2406.30 → 2412.04] But, you know, in turn, as a response, their hearts feel so distant from God,
[2412.74 → 2414.70] they've withheld their love for God, too.
[2415.54 → 2419.36] They felt, therefore, no need to centre their lives in God,
[2419.62 → 2421.68] no need to worship him faithfully.
[2421.82 → 2423.14] There's injustice in the land.
[2423.74 → 2427.28] They've returned home, but they haven't returned to God.
[2427.46 → 2432.84] Now, how does God respond to their doubts?
[2433.38 → 2435.50] Does he take offence at it?
[2436.42 → 2437.28] The answer is no.
[2438.12 → 2443.00] Even when they've come to wrong conclusions about God's love for them,
[2443.18 → 2444.66] God responds graciously.
[2445.32 → 2446.94] He reaffirms his love.
[2447.98 → 2450.18] You know, and I think this should be so encouraging to us.
[2450.18 → 2450.62] Right?
[2450.62 → 2457.66] No matter how frustrated or doubting or questioning or angry we might be towards God,
[2457.90 → 2464.22] the fact that this is written in the Bible means that we are invited to ask God these kinds of questions.
[2464.92 → 2467.36] And we see this over and over in the Psalms, for instance.
[2467.52 → 2470.52] The psalmist asks some very difficult questions to God.
[2470.52 → 2472.34] So, look at this.
[2472.44 → 2474.00] Look at Psalm 10, verse 1.
[2476.32 → 2478.92] Why do you hide yourselves in times of trouble?
[2479.76 → 2480.24] God?
[2481.28 → 2482.66] This is an honest question.
[2484.26 → 2485.50] Then Psalm 22.
[2486.86 → 2488.88] Why are you so far from saving me?
[2489.48 → 2492.32] So far from my cries of anguish?
[2493.12 → 2493.26] Right?
[2493.26 → 2495.50] It just sounds like God isn't listening.
[2496.94 → 2498.06] He's not saving.
[2498.88 → 2499.98] Or Psalm 89.
[2501.30 → 2503.86] Lord, where is your steadfast love?
[2505.76 → 2508.40] You know, and God, this is the word of the Lord.
[2508.92 → 2513.10] And God is giving us these words that we might speak back to him.
[2513.10 → 2517.66] And he invites us to get all of our doubts, all of our questions out on the table.
[2518.48 → 2520.66] So that he can deal with them.
[2520.66 → 2527.84] And even when our question becomes an accusation, God will answer because he truly does love us.
[2528.80 → 2531.20] And that brings us then to the second part of this passage.
[2532.10 → 2538.00] Where God then reassures his people of his unfailing, his dependable love for them.
[2538.76 → 2542.22] So God says, I have loved you.
[2542.74 → 2545.36] The people respond, how have you loved us?
[2545.82 → 2547.42] And what is God's response?
[2547.42 → 2551.48] And we see here that God responds in two ways.
[2551.82 → 2553.72] He tells them to look back.
[2554.08 → 2555.52] And he tells them to look around.
[2557.12 → 2559.08] So first he tells them to look back.
[2559.82 → 2562.20] In verse 2, God responds, and this is what he says.
[2563.16 → 2565.50] Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
[2566.12 → 2567.00] Declares the Lord.
[2567.12 → 2570.04] Yet I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated.
[2570.04 → 2583.94] Now, I think for many of us, if I were to ask you right now to get a piece of paper and a pen and write down a few sentences about what God's love is really like.
[2584.44 → 2586.08] And you had to think about what's God's love like.
[2586.12 → 2586.98] You had to write a couple of things.
[2587.66 → 2589.78] I don't think this is what you would write.
[2590.74 → 2593.94] I think you would maybe come up with something very different.
[2593.94 → 2599.32] But if you were an ancient Israelite, you would get this point very quickly.
[2600.78 → 2603.80] This is a reference that goes way back to the Book of Genesis.
[2604.46 → 2606.04] And here is the story.
[2607.02 → 2612.10] God calls Abraham, and he says he is going to make him the father of a great nation.
[2612.86 → 2614.74] Then Abraham has a son named Isaac.
[2615.48 → 2618.86] Isaac has twin boys with his wife, Rebecca.
[2618.86 → 2623.68] The older brother was named Esau, and the younger brother was named Jacob.
[2624.60 → 2630.00] And even before they were born, God comes to Isaac and Rebecca, and he says,
[2630.44 → 2633.78] I've chosen the second over the first.
[2634.32 → 2640.30] I've set my favour on the younger brother, Jacob, not the older brother, Esau.
[2641.08 → 2646.28] And so God, for his own reasons, he just says, I have loved Jacob.
[2646.28 → 2650.02] I have set my blessing and my love on Jacob.
[2651.34 → 2655.64] Now, so how does hearing, I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated,
[2655.86 → 2658.96] how does that reassure Israel of God's love for them?
[2659.68 → 2665.38] What would God's people hear God saying to them when he says this?
[2666.46 → 2671.86] Well, in saying this, God is saying his love for them is unconditional.
[2672.60 → 2673.44] It is unconditional.
[2673.44 → 2679.46] It is very interesting, the apostle Paul quotes this verse from Malachi in Romans chapter 9.
[2680.20 → 2685.86] Romans chapter 9 is that famous chapter about election, and this is what Paul says in Romans 9.
[2686.94 → 2691.22] Rebecca's children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.
[2691.58 → 2695.90] Yet before the twins were born or had done anything, good or bad,
[2695.90 → 2701.54] in order that God's purposes in election might stand, not by works, but by him who calls.
[2702.34 → 2707.28] She was told the older will serve the younger, just as it is written,
[2708.00 → 2712.14] Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.
[2712.14 → 2717.46] And you see there that quote at the end.
[2718.68 → 2721.42] That is Paul quoting our passage here in Malachi.
[2722.42 → 2728.18] And he does so in order to say that God's love for us is not based on anything in us,
[2728.24 → 2731.10] but it is based entirely on his purposes,
[2731.54 → 2736.14] his own free, sovereign choosing of whom he will love.
[2736.14 → 2742.60] And Malachi here is reminding Israel that through their father Jacob, God has chosen them.
[2743.48 → 2745.96] So the Israelites, they would be hearing God saying,
[2747.06 → 2750.86] you were not more deserving of my love than Esau was.
[2751.64 → 2757.72] In fact, Esau was the firstborn, so technically he was more deserving of my blessing.
[2757.90 → 2761.66] Yet I have chosen Jacob before he had done anything good or evil.
[2761.66 → 2763.76] I chose Jacob while he was still in the womb.
[2764.74 → 2771.16] And in the same way, there is nothing particularly special about Israel that they warranted God's love.
[2771.92 → 2775.44] The scriptures actually say there wasn't anything special about Israel.
[2776.18 → 2779.24] Here's what God says to his people in Deuteronomy chapter 7.
[2780.48 → 2780.98] He says,
[2781.14 → 2787.44] The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people,
[2787.82 → 2789.50] his treasured possession.
[2789.50 → 2797.68] The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples,
[2797.96 → 2800.14] for you were the fewest of all peoples.
[2801.62 → 2805.32] But it was because the Lord loved you.
[2808.68 → 2812.40] So God doesn't love them because they're a great nation.
[2812.40 → 2816.66] He didn't love them because they were holy.
[2816.92 → 2820.72] They were actually a stubborn, rebellious people, according to God.
[2821.58 → 2826.24] And God is reminding them that he loves Israel because he chose to love Israel.
[2826.94 → 2830.28] And what that means is God's love for you and me is unconditional.
[2833.00 → 2834.86] We don't have to earn his love.
[2835.00 → 2836.56] We don't have to feel good enough.
[2836.64 → 2837.66] We don't have to merit it.
[2837.66 → 2841.34] But God simply chooses to love us.
[2842.56 → 2844.18] And God's love is also persistent.
[2844.96 → 2845.38] Persistent.
[2845.70 → 2847.72] The story of Jacob and Esau, when did this happen?
[2848.86 → 2850.44] 1,500 years ago.
[2851.08 → 2851.22] Right?
[2851.34 → 2854.64] 1,500 years before Malachi writes this and speaks to God's people.
[2855.06 → 2858.12] And one of the things God is saying then is he says,
[2858.12 → 2866.16] listen, this love that I set on you, I set on you 1,500 years ago.
[2866.80 → 2869.10] And what have I done for 1,500 years?
[2869.48 → 2870.90] I have kept loving you.
[2871.60 → 2873.26] My love is persistent.
[2873.46 → 2876.76] My love is not deterred by your sin and your unfaithfulness.
[2877.48 → 2881.18] Don't forget how persistent I have been in my love for you.
[2881.42 → 2883.58] You're going to ask me if I've loved you?
[2883.58 → 2888.20] 1,500 years says, yes, I have loved you.
[2889.18 → 2891.98] And when God says, I have loved you, it's in the perfect tense.
[2892.52 → 2895.86] It means, I loved you in the past, I love you in the present,
[2896.04 → 2898.12] and I will always love you.
[2900.12 → 2901.80] God's love is unconditional.
[2902.56 → 2904.08] It is persistent.
[2905.20 → 2908.32] And in contrast, God says, but Esau I have hated.
[2909.18 → 2911.96] Now, we need to understand that when God says he hates Esau,
[2911.96 → 2913.40] it's not the emotion of hate.
[2915.12 → 2916.90] It's a Hebrew idiom.
[2917.08 → 2919.48] It means to love something more than something else.
[2919.78 → 2923.18] And it just means he is not including Esau in his covenant love.
[2924.16 → 2928.28] And so in regard to Israel's election as God's people, God loves them.
[2929.52 → 2933.48] And for reasons only known to God, he did not choose Edom.
[2933.54 → 2937.60] He did not choose Esau and the people who came out of his family, the Edo mites.
[2937.60 → 2942.02] To put it more harshly, God has rejected Esau.
[2942.90 → 2946.28] And it is a mystery to us why God chose Israel.
[2946.88 → 2953.88] But for his own reasons, God has elected Israel to play a major role in his redemptive purposes in the world.
[2953.88 → 2958.82] But that's the first way, then, that God responds to Israel's doubts.
[2959.18 → 2960.94] They say, God, how have you loved us?
[2961.52 → 2966.94] God says, look back at history, at how I chose your father Jacob.
[2967.60 → 2969.94] You did not do anything to earn my love.
[2970.44 → 2973.34] And that means you can't do anything to unlearn my love.
[2974.28 → 2975.10] I loved you.
[2975.10 → 2981.84] And even when God sent them into exile as a consequence of their sin, it was not absent of God's love.
[2982.50 → 2985.22] They seem to be forgetting their very own proverb.
[2985.86 → 2987.70] Look at Proverb 3, verse 12.
[2988.76 → 2993.68] God says, the Lord disciplines those he loves as a father of the son he delights in.
[2995.26 → 2999.24] Israel had forgotten that even exile could be used for their good.
[2999.98 → 3002.14] God sent them into exile because he loves them.
[3002.14 → 3005.88] He wants them to stop living in the ways that they were living.
[3006.28 → 3009.04] To wake up to the fact that they are God's people.
[3009.28 → 3012.88] That he calls them to live according to his ways.
[3012.94 → 3014.04] To be his special people.
[3014.74 → 3016.44] So he does it because he loves them.
[3016.58 → 3018.82] To bring them back to himself.
[3019.94 → 3023.14] But then finally, there's a second way that God says,
[3023.82 → 3025.94] in response to Israel's doubt, that he loves them.
[3026.58 → 3028.92] It's not only to look back into history.
[3028.92 → 3034.90] To see God's unconditional, his persistent love to them through all of these centuries.
[3035.70 → 3042.48] But God says, look around and see how I continue to love you.
[3043.36 → 3045.48] And we see this in our passage in this way.
[3047.06 → 3054.96] Throughout Israel's history, the Edo mites, the descendants of Esau, fight on and off with Israel.
[3054.96 → 3057.78] And most recently, what happened is this.
[3057.86 → 3062.42] When Israel went into exile, when the Babylonians came, and they took them from their land,
[3063.40 → 3064.26] Edom joined in.
[3065.14 → 3070.58] The scriptures tell us that Edom not only joined in helping the Babylonians against Israel,
[3070.74 → 3072.94] but they boasted over Israel's ruin.
[3074.60 → 3077.10] And now Israel, they've returned home.
[3077.60 → 3079.26] They're rebuilding things.
[3080.10 → 3083.26] Things are kind of getting back into, you know, they're not good.
[3083.26 → 3084.78] But God is rebuilding.
[3085.68 → 3087.38] But what had happened to Edom?
[3088.24 → 3092.90] Their cities were eventually completely destroyed by the Persian Empire.
[3094.16 → 3098.34] And so the Edo mites, those who are left, are looking up at Israel.
[3099.36 → 3101.58] And they're looking at Israel to get reestablished.
[3101.68 → 3103.18] They're looking at them rebuild the temple.
[3103.84 → 3107.54] And the Edo mites say, well, why don't we rebuild too?
[3108.80 → 3110.72] And look at what God says in verse 3 and 4.
[3110.72 → 3116.82] Edo mites say, though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.
[3117.32 → 3119.26] But this is what the Lord Almighty says.
[3119.94 → 3122.14] They may build, but I will demolish.
[3122.54 → 3127.46] They will be called the wicked land of people always under the wrath of God.
[3127.46 → 3130.72] Isn't that a little harsh?
[3131.40 → 3132.08] I mean, really.
[3132.92 → 3136.24] Why is God so harsh to the Edo mites?
[3136.34 → 3137.90] He calls them the wicked land.
[3138.18 → 3140.80] He calls them people always under the wrath of God.
[3141.64 → 3142.58] Like, that's pretty harsh.
[3143.86 → 3149.24] But what it tells us is that it is a grave sin to attack the people of God.
[3149.24 → 3154.74] The Edo mites are setting themselves against the people that God loves.
[3155.84 → 3159.32] If you insult my wife Christi, you insult me.
[3160.70 → 3161.10] Right?
[3161.22 → 3162.62] We understand how that works.
[3162.68 → 3164.68] You mess with them, you're coming through me.
[3164.76 → 3165.46] You're a mess with me.
[3165.46 → 3170.62] And God's affections are on Israel.
[3171.56 → 3178.04] And so when Edom betrayed Israel in this way, they set themselves not against only the Israelites,
[3178.22 → 3180.02] they set themselves against God.
[3181.10 → 3184.46] And God says, your own eyes will see it.
[3185.00 → 3185.88] Look at verse 5.
[3185.88 → 3192.78] You will see it with your own eyes and say, great is the Lord, even beyond the borders of Israel.
[3194.20 → 3198.28] So God doesn't want Israel just to remember how he's loved them in the past.
[3198.46 → 3203.36] He wants them to see in the present that he has not stopped loving them.
[3203.92 → 3205.70] That he is fighting their enemies.
[3206.14 → 3207.36] He is protecting them.
[3207.44 → 3212.18] He is still faithful to his covenant, even though they are not faithfully following him.
[3212.18 → 3216.80] He says, look around with your own eyes and see what I've done to Edom.
[3217.60 → 3219.14] See how I still love you.
[3221.34 → 3223.24] This is what God says to his people.
[3224.12 → 3226.28] The first thing he says to the prophet Malachi.
[3226.92 → 3230.20] And there, again, there are lots of things God is going to address with his people.
[3231.06 → 3235.26] He needs them to know, though, first that he loves them.
[3236.10 → 3239.46] And it's out of his love that he is going to call them back to faithfulness to him.
[3239.46 → 3242.70] And to call them back to living according to his ways.
[3243.66 → 3245.92] So let's move to some application.
[3247.58 → 3256.56] I think we have to ask, how do we as God's people today, how can we be comforted by these words from Malachi?
[3256.56 → 3267.74] Malachi, when we look at our awful circumstances in life, or when you just have an absence in your life that makes God feel far away from you,
[3268.26 → 3273.74] and you're unsure of his love, how can you know that God still loves us?
[3274.88 → 3277.10] And I think Malachi would tell us two things.
[3277.84 → 3282.04] Malachi would tell us to look back, and he would tell us to look around.
[3282.04 → 3287.46] How did God assure Israel of his love?
[3287.64 → 3289.76] He appealed to his history with them.
[3289.84 → 3291.94] He said, look at how I have loved you.
[3292.54 → 3297.96] And in the same way, if you and I, we find ourselves doubting God's love, history is a good place to begin.
[3298.84 → 3304.80] You can look back at your own life and remember all the ways that God has loved you.
[3304.80 → 3310.62] All the ways in your life that God has been kind to you.
[3311.62 → 3313.86] All the ways that he has blessed you.
[3315.88 → 3316.78] We can look back.
[3316.86 → 3317.42] We can remember.
[3317.64 → 3322.94] When we're in our circumstances, at the moment, it seems like we just forget everything.
[3323.06 → 3325.28] We forget all of God's faithfulness to us in the past.
[3326.56 → 3328.26] But here, Malachi says, look back.
[3328.36 → 3329.90] Look at God's persistent love for you.
[3330.14 → 3331.52] His unconditional love for you.
[3331.84 → 3333.38] And we can do that too in our own lives.
[3333.38 → 3337.06] But secondly, I think Malachi would tell us to look around.
[3338.14 → 3339.14] And I mean that literally.
[3339.66 → 3340.68] Like in this room.
[3341.66 → 3347.10] If you are hearing the word of God this morning, that is proof that God still loves his people.
[3347.80 → 3355.20] And I know we've had this cross-training class where we've heard from each other how God has loved us.
[3355.92 → 3356.96] And so we can look around.
[3357.04 → 3360.62] We can look at God's faithfulness to us in this church.
[3360.62 → 3366.30] I mean here we are in Ladder, British Columbia, thousands of years after Malachi wrote this.
[3366.30 → 3369.68] On the other side of the world, worshipping the Lord.
[3370.96 → 3375.18] God's love has extended to us beyond the borders of Israel.
[3376.38 → 3377.38] He has loved us.
[3377.38 → 3383.06] If you made it to church today, God has loved you because he is at work in your life.
[3384.06 → 3388.00] But ultimately, friends, we see the love of God for us most clearly.
[3388.86 → 3389.14] How?
[3390.50 → 3391.18] In Jesus.
[3391.94 → 3392.16] Right?
[3392.24 → 3392.98] In Jesus Christ.
[3393.78 → 3396.38] Listen to Paul's words in Romans chapter 5, verse 8.
[3396.38 → 3400.40] God demonstrates his own love for us in this.
[3400.84 → 3403.60] While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[3404.38 → 3409.40] The way that you know that God loves you is because he sent Jesus to die for you.
[3409.82 → 3411.76] So that you would not be forsaken.
[3412.32 → 3413.64] You would not be destroyed.
[3413.82 → 3414.84] You would not be exiled.
[3414.98 → 3418.44] You would not be left in the wicked country separated from him.
[3418.44 → 3424.94] And if you are doubting that God loves you, if you are doubting that God even could love you,
[3425.60 → 3428.48] God reminds us that we aren't deserving of his love.
[3428.84 → 3432.74] We can't earn it through our goodness, through our own faithfulness to him,
[3433.02 → 3437.10] but he has chosen to love you because of Jesus.
[3438.38 → 3444.46] And so if you want to know the deeply personal and the passionate, choosing love of the creator of this world,
[3445.20 → 3447.46] look to his love for you on the cross.
[3448.44 → 3449.06] Let's pray together.
[3452.78 → 3459.48] Father God, we thank you for these words of your prophet Malachi written so long ago,
[3460.30 → 3465.30] where even, Lord, in this sometimes obscure little prophetic book,
[3465.88 → 3472.14] tucked into the Old Testament, the very opening lines are a reminder that you love us.
[3472.94 → 3478.38] You are the God who loves your people because of who you are.
[3478.44 → 3484.88] And so, Lord, we like the people of Israel so long ago.
[3485.78 → 3488.56] Lord, we are still a doubting people.
[3489.50 → 3490.82] We question.
[3491.36 → 3492.12] We accuse.
[3493.40 → 3494.70] We shake our fists.
[3494.88 → 3495.92] We cross our arms.
[3496.24 → 3498.14] We say, Lord, how have you loved us?
[3499.62 → 3505.08] But, Lord, help us to be reminded of your unconditional love, your persistent love.
[3505.08 → 3514.62] And, Lord, would you continue by your Holy Spirit that is poured out into our hearts to know the love that you have for us in Jesus Christ.
[3515.54 → 3520.60] Lord, in this season of Lent, as we especially turn our eyes to the cross,
[3520.70 → 3526.10] help us to see there the great love of God for us, his people.
[3526.10 → 3528.26] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3528.68 → 3528.98] Amen.
[3531.04 → 3532.68] So let's sing our song of response.
[3533.34 → 3534.64] The love of God.
[3534.64 → 3555.00] I think verse 3 of this song probably describes, from a human perspective, the size, the breadth, and the depth of God's love better than many other expressions that have been penned.
[3555.00 → 3566.08] And so really enjoy all the words of this song that highlight and underscore God's love, as we've heard of in the message today, and celebrate his goodness and love.
[3566.16 → 3566.60] Let's stand.
[3566.60 → 3566.64] Let's stand.
[3566.64 → 3596.62] Let's stand.
[3596.64 → 3597.96] Let's stand.
[3608.06 → 3611.90] Let's stand.
[3612.30 → 3614.82] Let's stand.
[3614.82 → 3624.08] The love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[3624.08 → 3633.86] We shall forevermore endure the saints and angels sung.
[3634.76 → 3643.40] When years of time shall pass away, and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall.
[3643.40 → 3652.52] And when weary appears to break, how rocks and hills and mountains fall.
[3652.98 → 3661.76] And steps, so sure shall still endure, how measureless and strong.
[3662.20 → 3671.04] Redeeming grace to Adam's ways, that sings an angel's song.
[3671.04 → 3680.90] The love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[3681.24 → 3690.04] We shall forevermore endure the saints and angels sung.
[3690.04 → 3700.44] Could we with ink the ocean fill, and where the skies of parchment made?
[3700.86 → 3709.04] Where every star on earth a quill, and every man a sky-wide train.
[3709.04 → 3719.42] To earn the love of God and blood would drain the ocean dry.
[3719.78 → 3729.28] Nor could the scroll contain the hope, and all stretch from sky to sky.
[3729.28 → 3738.28] The love of God, how measureless and strong.
[3738.28 → 3748.80] We shall forevermore endure the saints and angels sung.
[3748.80 → 3752.10] You may be seated.
[3752.10 → 3752.50] Amen.
[3765.34 → 3772.88] Now one of the reasons I love that song is that last verse that we sang about the oceans as like ink,
[3772.98 → 3773.98] and the sky is like parchment.
[3773.98 → 3777.32] That was written by a man in an assay in the asylum.
[3778.64 → 3783.44] He added that verse to this older song, and thinking about his circumstances,
[3784.02 → 3785.36] wondering where is the love of God.
[3786.24 → 3789.72] But he wrote that verse about God's love.
[3790.06 → 3791.40] So I always think that's very powerful.
[3793.08 → 3795.44] So friends, we cannot do this life alone.
[3796.54 → 3802.18] And thankfully we don't have to, because we have a loving Father who does walk with us.
[3802.18 → 3807.66] So let's come before him now, and let's lift all of our prayers and our requests to him.
[3808.62 → 3809.44] Let's pray.
[3812.02 → 3816.44] Our gracious Heavenly Father, great and marvellous are your deeds.
[3817.28 → 3823.46] Lord God Almighty, just and true are your ways, King of the nations.
[3823.46 → 3829.52] Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name, for you alone are holy.
[3830.34 → 3836.88] All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.
[3838.06 → 3845.22] We give thanks for Christ our Saviour, who loved us and gave himself for us to make us children of God.
[3845.22 → 3852.90] And Father, by your Holy Spirit, we are filled with hope and endurance as we wait for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3853.66 → 3858.68] Please open the eyes of our hearts to see the glorious hope we have in Christ,
[3859.34 → 3863.48] your love for all the saints, and your power that is at work with us.
[3863.48 → 3874.92] Jesus, we thank you for putting us in a church family where we have both the calling and the privilege to care for one another.
[3876.16 → 3884.90] Lord, we thank you for our elders and our deacons and other leaders of this church whom you have called and equipped to care for your people.
[3884.90 → 3893.36] You have given each of them unique gifts, and you have exhorted them to use their gifts for the building up of this body and for your glory.
[3894.20 → 3899.28] You give them wisdom and grace to lead us in paths of righteousness for your namesake.
[3900.30 → 3908.30] So, Lord, would you continue to provide leaders for our church as we seek to nominate new office bearers in this time now, Lord.
[3909.16 → 3911.76] Lord, you know those whom you have called to this work.
[3911.76 → 3921.00] And we pray that you would make it clear to them in their hearts so that they might step out in faith and entrust in you to serve as you have called.
[3922.92 → 3929.36] Almighty God, we thank you also for the ways that you've continued to work through the local ministries of our church, Lander CRC.
[3930.04 → 3935.42] We continue to pray that through the work and the service of us, your people,
[3935.88 → 3940.06] that your gospel would be proclaimed to the hearts of young and old alike.
[3940.06 → 3947.06] Those of us who are part of our church community as well, Lord, as our neighbours around us.
[3949.16 → 3954.22] And, Lord, we especially pray, Lord, for the ministries of our church.
[3954.44 → 3958.60] As we've just said, Lord, we think of Friendship Club, Coffee House.
[3958.74 → 3960.34] We think of Cadets and Gems.
[3961.22 → 3964.08] Lord, we think of our ESL ministry and our coffee fellowship.
[3964.08 → 3967.72] We think of our cross-training, our Mandarin ministry.
[3968.84 → 3973.06] And, Lord, just our service of worship week by week.
[3974.10 → 3977.54] Lord, in all of these things, would you be glorified in your name proclaimed.
[3979.38 → 3983.78] And, Lord, we don't have to move to a different country to live out your calling on us
[3983.78 → 3986.50] and your desire for us to be fishers of men,
[3986.50 → 3990.82] to share the good news of Christ's love and salvation with those around us.
[3991.50 → 3995.18] Help us all to bring the fragrance of Christ to the lost.
[3996.06 → 3997.64] Guide us, O God, by your Spirit,
[3998.12 → 4002.94] so that through all life we may tell and show forth our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[4004.18 → 4007.72] We pray, gracious Father, for those in our congregation who are sick,
[4008.50 → 4011.10] who are isolated, and who are experiencing loss.
[4011.10 → 4018.88] We remember this morning Jordan, Nancy, Amy, and Grace.
[4019.78 → 4022.76] We remember, Lord, many others as well.
[4022.90 → 4025.74] Would you continue to heal them and restore them to full health?
[4026.34 → 4029.34] Take care of their families, provide for their needs.
[4029.50 → 4033.88] And, Lord, most of all, would you help them to experience your comfort and your love?
[4035.52 → 4039.50] We pray for our province, our nation, and our world.
[4039.50 → 4043.24] Lord, remind us again, Lord, that you rule over the nations
[4043.24 → 4045.92] and you govern and preserve them for your purposes.
[4046.78 → 4049.40] We bring before you the people of Ukraine and Russia
[4049.40 → 4052.32] and ask for peace between these nations.
[4053.22 → 4056.76] Father, we pray for the survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
[4057.38 → 4060.06] We pray that aid would pour out from the nations
[4060.06 → 4064.68] to provide needed help and resources for those who are facing hurt,
[4065.34 → 4068.18] homelessness, hunger, and many things.
[4069.50 → 4073.12] Father, we pray for our federal, our provincial, and our local leaders.
[4074.02 → 4077.24] Give them, Lord, your wisdom and help them
[4077.24 → 4081.52] so that goodness and righteousness would prevail in our land.
[4082.62 → 4085.16] And lastly, Lord, as we enter into the season of Lent,
[4085.84 → 4088.08] would you change the posture of our hearts
[4088.08 → 4091.92] to grieve for the things that grieve you,
[4091.92 → 4094.88] to change where you ask us to change,
[4095.60 → 4098.14] and help us, Lord, to fix our minds on Christ,
[4098.24 → 4099.72] our good shepherd and our redeemer.
[4101.78 → 4104.44] Father, we lay all these things down at your feet
[4104.44 → 4107.22] and we pray them in the name of Jesus Christ.
[4107.96 → 4108.28] Amen.
[4108.28 → 4108.40] Amen.
[4109.96 → 4112.20] And I did realize, as I was praying,
[4112.30 → 4113.26] that I messed up the order.
[4114.00 → 4116.40] So we will now collect our tithes and offerings.
[4116.76 → 4117.76] Normally we do that first.
[4118.92 → 4120.60] So don't worry, we will do it still.
[4121.72 → 4123.20] Two offerings are for today.
[4123.36 → 4126.46] One is our local church ministries that we prayed for,
[4126.56 → 4127.12] that's why I remembered.
[4128.18 → 4131.06] We collect that offering to just support
[4131.06 → 4132.46] the ongoing work of our own church.
[4133.12 → 4135.38] Secondly, though, we also want to contribute
[4135.38 → 4138.74] to helping those who need help,
[4139.00 → 4141.48] who are survivors of the Turkey and Syria earthquake.
[4142.14 → 4144.36] So we will be taking up an offering for that.
[4144.42 → 4146.18] You can read about this in your bulletin as well.
[4147.32 → 4149.42] Now the instructions are that though,
[4149.84 → 4151.58] you need to write on the envelope,
[4151.70 → 4152.46] your giving envelope,
[4152.46 → 4155.64] that it is designated for Turkey, Syria earthquake relief,
[4156.42 → 4158.96] for that to go toward that cause.
[4158.96 → 4162.54] So may I ask the deacons to come forward
[4162.54 → 4163.50] and collect the morning offering.
[4163.50 → 4164.50] Thank you.
