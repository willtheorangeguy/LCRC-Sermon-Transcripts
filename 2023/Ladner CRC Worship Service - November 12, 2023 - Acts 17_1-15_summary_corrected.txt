• People will often convince themselves of what they want to believe, rather than accepting the truth.
• There are three responses to the gospel: indifference (not caring or listening), resistance (anger and opposition), and persuasion (believing).
• Even those who resist the gospel by getting angry about it may be closer to God than those who are indifferent.
• God can convert people through his word, even if they initially resist.
• Some people will eventually believe in Jesus as their saviour after being persuaded by the gospel message.
• The responses of the Jews in Thessalonica and Berea to Paul's preaching
• The difference between being persuaded and noble listening
• 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13: receiving the word of God as it actually is
• Noble listening: examining the scriptures, eager to learn and grow, not just accepting or dismissing what is said
• Luke's point: nobility in the eyes of God is about listening to what God is saying, loving the truth of God's word most
• Proper listening to a sermon is not about taking notes or evaluating the preacher's performance, but rather about worshipping God and hearing His voice.
• When the word of God is preached, it is God speaking directly to you through the Holy Spirit.
• The relationship between God and his people involves God speaking and us responding with faithfulness and obedience.
• Martin Luther emphasized that when we hear a sermon, it's not the minister who speaks, but rather God Himself through the minister.
• Attuning ourselves to the voice of God can bring blessings and nourishment from His word.
• When preaching is unfaithful or lacking, it's still possible for God to communicate with us, even if only in small ways (e.g. "crumbs").
• We should focus on listening for what God is saying through His word rather than evaluating the preacher or their style.
• Growing in noble listening involves receiving God's word eagerly and examining its truth by comparing it to Scripture.
