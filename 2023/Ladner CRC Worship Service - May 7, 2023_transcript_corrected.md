[0.00 → 1.36] or pick one up on the phone table.
[2.48 → 3.84] This is just every day.
[4.02 → 7.76] It gives us some scripture readings from the Old Testament
[7.76 → 10.08] and New Testament and the Psalms to read alone.
[13.44 → 17.10] Also, next Sunday, right after the service,
[17.76 → 18.78] I believe it's next Sunday,
[19.16 → 21.50] we will be having our affirmation vote
[21.50 → 24.90] for our elders and deacons.
[25.14 → 27.86] So you can look at that in the bulletin.
[30.00 → 35.46] So we are here this morning, though, to worship God,
[36.32 → 40.26] the one true God who has created us,
[40.84 → 43.02] who has also been faithful to us,
[43.28 → 46.34] and who through Christ has covered our shame
[46.34 → 48.58] and raised us to new life in him.
[49.36 → 53.20] And he will continue to work out his purposes in us
[53.20 → 54.16] through his Holy Spirit.
[55.22 → 58.38] And this is the God who this morning and every day
[58.38 → 60.22] calls us to worship.
[60.86 → 64.10] So let's hear and respond to the call to worship this morning
[64.10 → 65.94] from Psalm 145.
[68.16 → 71.30] Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[72.04 → 74.62] His greatness no one can fathom.
[75.76 → 78.96] One generation commends your works to another.
[78.96 → 82.02] They tell of your mighty acts.
[82.58 → 85.56] They speak of the glorious splendour of your majesty,
[85.56 → 88.68] and I will meditate on your wonderful works.
[89.56 → 92.06] They celebrate your abundant goodness
[92.06 → 95.30] and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[96.34 → 99.48] The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
[99.74 → 102.52] slow to anger and rich in love.
[102.52 → 108.82] Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[109.32 → 112.62] Please remain seated while we sing our first song this morning,
[113.10 → 115.00] God himself is with us.
[115.00 → 139.28] God himself is with us.
[139.28 → 169.26] God himself is with us.
[169.26 → 199.24] God himself is with us.
[199.24 → 229.22] God himself is with us.
[229.22 → 231.14] God himself is with us.
[231.14 → 259.20] God himself is with us.
[259.20 → 267.20] Out of every blessing
[267.20 → 272.20] Purify my spirit
[273.10 → 280.20] Trusting only in your merit
[280.74 → 286.62] Like the holy angels
[286.62 → 291.38] Who behold your glory
[291.38 → 298.62] May I ceaselessly adore you
[299.98 → 305.62] And in all great and small
[305.62 → 310.62] Sing to you most dearly
[310.62 → 317.62] What you love so dearly
[317.62 → 328.44] Now I'm awake.
[330.94 → 333.68] Please join me as we go before the Lord in prayer.
[333.68 → 342.76] O Lord, the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you.
[343.88 → 351.56] You are our God and Saviour, the creator of the cosmos, the fount of every blessing.
[351.56 → 359.02] O Father, out of all you have made, you have chosen to make us in your image and likeness,
[359.60 → 367.42] that we might see you truly, understand you in our finite way, and marvel at your glory.
[367.42 → 375.56] We praise you, Jesus, for coming to earth and dwelling among us in grace and in mercy and in boundless love
[375.56 → 382.00] to redeem us out of our sin and failings and to restore us to relationship with you.
[382.98 → 389.68] And you dwell in us now by your spirit, enabling us to follow in the ways of Jesus our Saviour.
[389.68 → 396.92] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, at all times and in all places, you are worthy of our praise.
[397.62 → 401.28] This morning, would you stir our hearts to delight in you,
[401.84 → 407.10] and would you heal and restore us as we cast all of our cares and our burdens upon you,
[407.58 → 411.84] as you invite us to, that we might find rest for our souls.
[412.50 → 415.28] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[415.28 → 415.38] Amen.
[416.56 → 424.32] Please rise in body or in spirit as you are able and hear God's greeting to us this morning from Psalm 104,
[424.74 → 426.46] 100, verse 4.
[428.54 → 432.88] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[433.54 → 436.24] Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[436.98 → 442.30] For the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever.
[442.30 → 448.62] Please, now, as God has greeted us, greet those around you with a handshake,
[448.74 → 453.44] but maybe not everyone wants to shake hands, so maybe just a wave or a greeting is fine too.
[453.44 → 453.76] Amen.
[453.76 → 454.44] Amen.
[454.44 → 454.96] Amen.

[496.24 → 524.30] Come away from rush and weary, to the stillness of God's peace.
[524.30 → 534.38] From our vain ambitions, worry, come to rise to find release.
[534.98 → 544.56] Come away from noise and clamour, lasting arms and frenzied place.
[544.56 → 555.66] Come to join the people gathered, here to seek and find God's grace.
[557.06 → 566.56] In the pastures of God's goodness, we lie down to rest our soul.
[566.56 → 576.56] From the waters of God's mercy, we take deeply our made whole.
[578.08 → 587.56] At the table of God's presence, all the saints are richly fed.

[830.54 → 831.04] Amen.
[831.04 → 832.54] Amen.
[836.54 → 845.64] So, as we meditate on God's faithfulness and on who he is, his character, we become more
[845.64 → 849.40] aware of the ways that we are not like God.
[849.40 → 855.92] And the Holy Spirit prompts us to confess the ways that we fall short daily.
[855.92 → 861.52] So please join me as we turn to the Lord for his mercy and his grace.
[862.80 → 865.68] And we'll say this prayer responsibly together.
[866.50 → 872.70] We praise you, holy God, for your steadfast love given to us in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[873.86 → 881.92] Hold us by your grace, even as we have sinned against it and marred our relationship with you and our neighbour.
[881.92 → 888.46] We repent of our sins and long for you to restore us together.
[889.66 → 894.78] In your great love, come, cleanse, heal, and help us,
[895.24 → 903.84] that we may live out our days to the praise of your grace and to the glory of your holy name. Amen.
[904.94 → 910.04] And Lord, would you hear us now as we silently confess before you.
[911.92 → 912.92] Amen.
[931.06 → 938.28] Our Heavenly Father, our hearts, our lives are laid bare before you.
[938.28 → 941.60] Nothing is hidden from your sight.
[943.10 → 950.32] But Lord, would you look upon us as not with eyes of condemnation, but with eyes of love,
[951.46 → 955.82] eyes of mercy, forgiveness, and grace.
[956.80 → 960.46] Lord, you come to us because we could never come to you.
[960.46 → 968.12] And you came to us in the person of Jesus to lift us up with him in resurrection life.
[969.52 → 975.90] So Lord, we turn from our sins, and we turn to you.
[976.68 → 981.52] Lord, we turn from the ways of death, and we turn to the ways of life
[981.52 → 986.48] and help us to walk in those ways with your help and by the Spirit's work in us
[986.48 → 989.78] to do the good works that you have prepared for us to do.
[990.78 → 992.34] Lord, renew us as your people.
[993.12 → 995.26] Help us to know and experience your love,
[995.98 → 1001.08] that we might know your smiling eyes upon us, your children.
[1001.08 → 1003.06] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1003.58 → 1003.86] Amen.
[1006.18 → 1010.62] So we worship a God who delights to show us mercy when we come to him in repentance.
[1011.38 → 1018.90] So now join with me in hearing and responding to the assurance of grace through Christ that he gives us.
[1018.90 → 1024.96] When the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared,
[1025.64 → 1029.32] he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done,
[1029.84 → 1031.22] but because of his mercy.
[1032.16 → 1037.82] He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
[1038.46 → 1044.34] whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour.
[1044.34 → 1049.84] So that, having been justified by his grace,
[1050.60 → 1054.44] we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
[1055.14 → 1056.60] Thanks be to God.
[1057.04 → 1058.32] Let's stand and sing,
[1058.74 → 1061.62] Amazing Grace, My Chains Are Gone.
[1061.70 → 1063.92] Please rise and we'll sing.
[1074.34 → 1093.68] Good night.
[1093.68 → 1095.78] Good.
[1095.78 → 1111.78] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[1111.78 → 1118.78] That saved a wretch my plea
[1118.78 → 1127.68] I once was lost, but now I'm found
[1127.68 → 1134.78] Was blind, but now I see
[1134.78 → 1144.26] T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1144.26 → 1152.16] And grace my fears relieved
[1152.16 → 1160.26] How precious did that grace appear
[1160.26 → 1167.16] The hour I first believed
[1167.16 → 1175.06] My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1175.06 → 1182.06] My God, my Saviour, has been so big
[1182.06 → 1189.06] And like the flood, His mercy rains
[1189.06 → 1197.96] Unending love, amazing grace
[1197.96 → 1206.06] The Lord has promised good to me
[1206.06 → 1212.96] His word my hope secures
[1212.96 → 1221.86] He will my shield and portion be
[1221.86 → 1229.86] As long as life endures
[1229.86 → 1238.76] Through many dangers, toils, and snares
[1238.76 → 1245.86] I have already come
[1245.86 → 1254.76] His grace hath brought me safe thus far
[1254.76 → 1262.66] And grace will be healed
[1262.66 → 1269.66] My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1269.66 → 1276.66] My God, my Saviour, has ransomed
[1276.66 → 1284.56] And like a flood, His mercy rains
[1284.56 → 1292.56] Unending love, amazing grace
[1292.56 → 1301.46] When we've been there 10,000 years
[1301.46 → 1308.46] Bright shining as the sun
[1308.46 → 1317.46] We've no last days to sing God's praise
[1317.46 → 1326.36] Than when we have first begun
[1326.36 → 1339.36] So the children, where are we at? Grade, no
[1339.36 → 1343.36] Age 3 to grade 5 are now dismissed to their classes
[1343.36 → 1344.36] From all of your degrees
[1344.36 → 1361.16] to the moon
[1361.16 → 1371.52] Also that
[1371.52 → 1378.52] That's fine, I'll read it.
[1378.52 → 1387.96] All right, well, in that case, let me do an introduction first.
[1387.96 → 1390.28] Yeah, wait, hold on.
[1390.28 → 1392.46] Okay.
[1392.46 → 1393.46] So good morning.
[1393.46 → 1396.44] It's nice to see you.
[1396.44 → 1404.68] We are in now today the third week of a six-week series that we are calling A Vision for Renewal.
[1404.68 → 1407.72] And this series is organized around our vision statement.
[1407.72 → 1412.72] And I hope all of us can learn this as we go along here for these six weeks during the
[1412.72 → 1414.34] season of Easter.
[1414.34 → 1418.24] So what is our vision statement as a church family?
[1418.24 → 1419.24] Here it is.
[1419.24 → 1423.40] Oh, yeah, you'll have to skip ahead.
[1423.40 → 1426.08] So please, let's say it together.
[1426.08 → 1432.44] We are called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1432.44 → 1438.50] So we want to be a church that proclaims the gospel of Jesus, that proclaims the gospel
[1438.50 → 1448.64] of Jesus, this gigantic good news that in Jesus Christ, God is renewing all things.
[1448.64 → 1455.18] And so this series is looking at the ways that God renews all things and how we are called
[1455.18 → 1461.96] together as a church to be a part of that, to be a part of what God is doing in the world,
[1461.96 → 1466.84] to bring his renewal through Jesus Christ to the entire world.
[1466.84 → 1471.32] So as a church, and actually Lori would go to the next slide.
[1471.32 → 1476.46] As a church, our vision for our life together is that we would join in what God is doing
[1476.46 → 1478.04] to renew all things.
[1478.04 → 1485.40] And that means that we want to see people renewed in their life with God, in their lives with
[1485.40 → 1490.76] themselves, their own hearts, with other people in relationship, and in the world.
[1490.76 → 1498.04] And as you can see on the screen, that these map on to these four central callings of the
[1498.04 → 1504.54] Christian life, the callings of the church, which is worship, discipleship, or spiritual
[1504.54 → 1507.76] formation, community, and mission.
[1507.76 → 1510.56] So this is how this works.
[1510.56 → 1515.20] So when we talk about the renewal of all things, this is how the Bible talks about it.
[1515.20 → 1520.48] Our relationship with God, ourselves, others in the world.
[1520.48 → 1526.10] And so last week, we looked at the first of these, our life with God and being renewed in
[1526.10 → 1527.10] worship.
[1527.10 → 1536.70] And we said last week that God is our original desire, our original love.
[1536.70 → 1540.34] He is the one for whom we were made.
[1540.34 → 1547.24] And that even though we in our sin, we set our desire and our love on other objects, and
[1547.24 → 1553.26] this is what the Bible calls idolatry, Jesus actually came to restore us to God and make
[1553.26 → 1557.84] us worshippers of the true God again, and to make us his children.
[1557.84 → 1564.38] And so today, we turn to the second of these, the second calling, which is renewing discipleship.
[1564.38 → 1568.88] Because not only are we renewed to God, that's not the only extent of the Christian life,
[1568.88 → 1570.90] being reconciled to God.
[1570.90 → 1572.14] That comes first.
[1572.14 → 1579.42] But then, as we are renewed in our relationship with God, God also renews us in ourselves,
[1579.42 → 1581.94] into the very image of Christ.
[1581.94 → 1587.38] So today, we're going to turn to this wonderful passage from Paul in Colossians, Colossians
[1587.38 → 1594.86] chapter 3, which is about the renewal of our very selves in and through Jesus.
[1594.86 → 1597.94] So that's what we're going to talk about today.
[1597.94 → 1599.88] Let's look at the passage together.
[1599.88 → 1605.78] So this is Colossians chapter 3, verses 1 through 17.
[1605.78 → 1607.18] Please do open the Bibles.
[1607.18 → 1608.78] We're going to be going through this passage.
[1608.78 → 1611.86] There's a lot there.
[1611.86 → 1614.84] So please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1614.84 → 1618.04] Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[1618.04 → 1624.16] Set your hearts on things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[1624.16 → 1627.66] Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
[1627.66 → 1633.00] For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[1633.00 → 1640.68] When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with him in glory.
[1640.68 → 1647.88] Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity,
[1647.88 → 1652.04] lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
[1652.04 → 1654.82] Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[1654.82 → 1658.82] You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived.
[1658.82 → 1664.32] And now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these, anger, rage, malice,
[1664.32 → 1667.14] slander, and filthy language from your lips.
[1667.14 → 1672.96] Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have
[1672.96 → 1680.44] put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator.
[1680.44 → 1686.78] Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or
[1686.78 → 1690.60] free, but Christ is all, and in all.
[1690.60 → 1697.60] Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion,
[1697.60 → 1701.66] kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[1701.66 → 1705.06] Bear with each other and forgive one another.
[1705.06 → 1711.62] If any of you has a grievance against someone, forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[1711.62 → 1718.02] Be over all of these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[1718.02 → 1723.96] Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you are called
[1723.96 → 1724.96] to peace.
[1724.96 → 1728.02] And be thankful.
[1728.02 → 1733.80] Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly, as you teach and admonish one another with
[1733.80 → 1740.00] all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude
[1740.00 → 1741.48] in your hearts.
[1741.48 → 1747.02] And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
[1747.02 → 1751.98] thanks to God the Father through him.
[1751.98 → 1753.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[1753.98 → 1755.74] Thanks be to God.
[1755.74 → 1758.74] Let's pray together.
[1758.74 → 1762.48] Lord, thank you so much for your faithfulness to us.
[1762.48 → 1769.70] We pray that you would now send your Holy Spirit to empower us and indwell us as we go
[1769.70 → 1773.66] to your word, that you would guide us into truth.
[1773.66 → 1776.66] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1776.66 → 1778.48] Amen.
[1778.48 → 1784.94] So on my various devices, my cell phone, my iPad, I get these notifications that remind
[1784.94 → 1792.04] me that a year ago, in these couple days, I was in Egypt and Jordan and Israel.
[1792.04 → 1794.08] It's been a year already.
[1794.08 → 1797.92] And so as maybe you know, I've talked about this in the past, but I went on this trip last
[1797.92 → 1801.80] May with some other pastors in the CRC.
[1801.80 → 1808.52] And one of the sites we visited in Israel is the cave of Abdullah.
[1808.52 → 1809.52] You know what?
[1809.52 → 1810.52] The cave of Abdullah.
[1810.52 → 1811.52] Abdullah.
[1811.52 → 1812.52] I won't say that again.
[1812.52 → 1815.40] Do you all remember what that is?
[1815.40 → 1821.26] That is where King David hid from, well, he wasn't King then David, hid from King Saul,
[1821.26 → 1823.26] who was trying to kill him.
[1823.26 → 1825.86] I did have a short video clip.
[1825.86 → 1827.46] I couldn't get it to work.
[1827.46 → 1830.44] So it's just as well because it's just a dark cave.
[1830.44 → 1833.48] So let me tell you about it instead.
[1833.48 → 1839.34] So the leader, our guide on this trip, he encouraged us to go into the cave, not just look at it
[1839.34 → 1840.34] from the outside.
[1840.34 → 1846.44] Now, when we look at this cave from the outside, it is very forbidding looking.
[1846.44 → 1851.98] But trusting our shepherd, we went into this cave.
[1851.98 → 1853.02] We made our way in.
[1853.02 → 1857.84] In a very short amount of time, it became total darkness.
[1857.84 → 1859.34] We were in this cave.
[1859.34 → 1865.20] And so we got out our phones, and we had the flashlight on our phones to see.
[1865.20 → 1870.38] And these very, very narrow tunnels that we would have to crawl through.
[1870.38 → 1874.38] And there's a whole line of us going through it.
[1874.38 → 1876.88] And so the tunnels would lead to this kind of chambers inside.
[1876.88 → 1882.28] And then there'd be another tunnel that would go up and down and lead to these other chambers.
[1882.28 → 1891.10] And at some point during our exploration, we kind of realized, we said out loud, well,
[1891.10 → 1893.80] why are we doing this?
[1893.80 → 1896.92] And we also came to realize we're halfway in.
[1896.92 → 1900.48] So what are we going to do?
[1900.48 → 1904.02] And so we decided, well, what we have to do is push through to the other side.
[1904.02 → 1906.52] And the reason we're doing this now is to get out of here.
[1906.52 → 1911.22] The reason we're doing this is we need to get out, and we need to push through to the
[1911.22 → 1914.52] light that we know is on the other side.
[1914.52 → 1919.52] And so on by one, we squeeze our bodies through these tunnels.
[1919.52 → 1925.52] I was watching this video again, and I was feeling claustrophobic just looking at it.
[1925.52 → 1928.22] It was kind of scary.
[1928.22 → 1930.52] Sometimes we would be on our hands and knees.
[1930.52 → 1935.02] Sometimes just on our elbows, dragging our legs behind us.
[1935.02 → 1937.72] Sometimes the only way to fit would be head first.
[1937.72 → 1940.72] Sometimes the only way to do it would be feet first.
[1940.72 → 1947.02] But all the while pressing towards the light that we could not see, but that we knew was
[1947.02 → 1948.02] there.
[1948.02 → 1950.02] Pressing toward it.
[1950.02 → 1952.72] And so here's why I'm telling you this.
[1952.72 → 1956.72] We're talking about the renewal of the person.
[1956.72 → 1963.22] This claim that through Jesus Christ, God is making us new as people.
[1963.22 → 1964.72] Right?
[1964.72 → 1968.72] In creation, God made us with dignity.
[1968.72 → 1973.22] In sin, we were unmade with depravity.
[1973.22 → 1977.72] But now Jesus is remaking us with love.
[1977.72 → 1984.22] And this process of being renewed in ourselves as men, women, and children is something that
[1984.22 → 1986.72] we cooperate in.
[1986.72 → 1989.72] We cooperate with the Holy Spirit's work within us.
[1989.72 → 1993.72] And what that involves is setting our feet on the Lord's path.
[1993.72 → 2000.22] This is a path, a path of righteousness that has been carved out for us.
[2000.22 → 2005.22] And we are not to depart from it, but rather we are to persist in it.
[2005.22 → 2014.22] But there are times when this path that we are called to follow seems very cramped and
[2014.22 → 2016.22] very dark.
[2016.22 → 2021.72] There are times when our path forward seems all but obstructed, whether it's by stuff in
[2021.72 → 2027.72] our own hearts or minds, or whether it's just by disappointment and suffering in life.
[2027.72 → 2033.72] And there are times when we are on this path that it takes a turn that we did not expect.
[2033.72 → 2039.72] And so we come to ask, why am I doing this?
[2039.72 → 2045.72] And how am I going to persevere and get through to the other side?
[2045.72 → 2052.22] And the answer, why we do this, is because of the light that is before us.
[2052.22 → 2058.22] Because of the promise of newness that awaits us, which is to be renewed in the image of
[2058.22 → 2060.22] our Creator.
[2060.22 → 2065.22] That is who God has called us to be.
[2065.22 → 2070.22] That we would become fully who we are created to be, fully human again.
[2070.22 → 2072.22] There's nothing wrong with being human.
[2072.22 → 2075.22] We are created human.
[2075.22 → 2080.22] We are to be remade according to the way God has made us again.
[2080.22 → 2083.72] So let's talk about this renewal that God wants for us.
[2083.72 → 2090.22] And from Colossians chapter 3, I want us to see that this renewal of our persons, the renewal
[2090.22 → 2093.72] of our hearts, requires two things from us.
[2093.72 → 2095.72] And here they are.
[2095.72 → 2099.72] First, it requires that we enter into death.
[2099.72 → 2102.88] And then secondly, that we emerge in life.
[2103.66 → 2104.76] Okay, so those are the two things.
[2104.88 → 2109.02] We need to enter into death, and we need to emerge into life.
[2110.06 → 2114.68] So first, the first thing, the first part of being renewed in ourselves
[2114.68 → 2119.68] as men and women and children is entering into death.
[2120.48 → 2124.82] Now, I realize that might sound very strange, right?
[2124.82 → 2126.06] I totally agree.
[2126.76 → 2129.32] But here's what I believe Paul is saying.
[2130.12 → 2132.92] He is saying that one of the mysteries of the Christian life
[2132.92 → 2137.18] is that it is a life that is centred on death.
[2137.92 → 2141.96] It is a life that is anchored in the death of Jesus
[2141.96 → 2145.98] and is lived in imitation of the death of Jesus.
[2147.18 → 2147.94] And you know what?
[2148.02 → 2150.20] Jesus himself talks about this, doesn't he?
[2150.72 → 2153.60] So I thought of Matthew 16, 24.
[2154.22 → 2157.52] Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[2157.52 → 2166.16] whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
[2166.98 → 2171.68] Our lives are to be lived in imitation of the death of Jesus.
[2171.68 → 2177.62] Jesus says to be his disciples is a life of crucifixion.
[2177.88 → 2179.38] It's a cruciform life.
[2179.94 → 2182.98] And that's why in this passage on discipleship in Colossians 3,
[2183.34 → 2185.12] Paul talks so much about death.
[2185.54 → 2187.76] And he calls us to enter into it.
[2188.46 → 2189.56] But how do we do that?
[2189.58 → 2191.04] How do we enter into death?
[2191.32 → 2192.74] What does it mean for us to do this?
[2192.74 → 2197.38] And this text suggests there are two ways that we enter into death.
[2197.90 → 2201.90] First is by embracing an identity of death.
[2202.38 → 2206.14] And secondly, by embracing a life of death.
[2206.70 → 2210.36] Okay, so we have an identity, and we have this way of life.
[2210.94 → 2213.00] So let's talk about the identity part first.
[2213.38 → 2215.56] How do we embrace an identity of death?
[2215.88 → 2217.24] Look at verse 3 with me.
[2217.24 → 2219.62] Paul says these words,
[2220.02 → 2223.10] For you have died, or you died,
[2223.62 → 2226.70] and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[2227.46 → 2230.90] Now, how often do you say that to people?
[2231.92 → 2233.12] For you died.
[2233.88 → 2235.82] That's a pretty amazing thing to say to someone.
[2236.90 → 2238.28] What does he mean?
[2239.38 → 2242.88] Well, Paul, he's first actually just talking about the death of Jesus.
[2242.88 → 2246.58] How Jesus has entered into the darkness of our sin
[2246.58 → 2249.38] and took it upon himself and how he died on the cross.
[2250.18 → 2252.70] But also in these words, Paul tells us
[2252.70 → 2256.90] that the crucifixion of Jesus was not just Jesus' death.
[2256.96 → 2258.38] It was also our death.
[2259.12 → 2261.68] Everybody who is united to Jesus by faith
[2261.68 → 2264.54] died with him on the cross.
[2265.48 → 2270.00] Paul says the same thing elsewhere in Romans 6, verse 3.
[2270.00 → 2271.86] He says,
[2272.18 → 2276.20] Don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ Jesus
[2276.20 → 2278.98] were baptized into his death?
[2281.10 → 2282.34] It's kind of shocking.
[2283.72 → 2287.44] But also, Galatians 2.20, my favourite verse.
[2288.52 → 2290.56] I have been crucified with Christ,
[2290.84 → 2292.34] and I no longer live.
[2292.42 → 2293.26] Christ lives in me.
[2293.92 → 2295.62] We are baptized into our death.
[2295.70 → 2297.18] We are crucified with Christ.
[2297.80 → 2299.08] Paul says you have died.
[2300.00 → 2300.64] Right?
[2300.72 → 2305.30] So through this mysterious union that we have with Jesus by faith,
[2305.68 → 2309.56] when Jesus died, we died with him.
[2310.42 → 2314.04] And amazingly, that means that we don't need to die again.
[2315.18 → 2315.40] Right?
[2315.44 → 2319.56] We have already died with him on the cross.
[2319.56 → 2322.42] So he's telling us that now,
[2323.32 → 2326.38] that we now have this identity of death,
[2326.72 → 2328.52] and he wants us to embrace it.
[2329.18 → 2330.34] So how do we do that?
[2330.38 → 2332.10] How do we embrace this identity of death?
[2333.10 → 2336.32] Well, Jesus tells us that because we died with Jesus on the cross,
[2336.50 → 2342.74] we must now consider or view ourselves as people who have died in Christ.
[2342.74 → 2345.72] That's how we are to now see ourselves.
[2346.32 → 2347.84] So look at verse 9.
[2349.24 → 2349.90] He says,
[2350.02 → 2351.22] Do not lie to each other,
[2352.18 → 2357.76] since you have taken off your old self with his practices,
[2358.24 → 2359.52] and yet put on a new self,
[2359.76 → 2362.72] which is being renewed in the knowledge of the image of its creator.
[2362.72 → 2366.12] So Paul here, he wants us to see that in Jesus,
[2366.62 → 2369.26] our old self with all of its sinful ways
[2369.26 → 2372.74] is no longer our fundamental identity.
[2373.42 → 2373.88] Right?
[2373.94 → 2375.40] We have a new status.
[2376.70 → 2379.04] You know, and it is very tempting,
[2380.04 → 2382.10] I think, I know for me,
[2382.46 → 2383.60] I think probably for you too,
[2384.00 → 2385.84] to see our sins,
[2386.20 → 2387.72] our sins of mind,
[2388.18 → 2389.82] our sins of heart, of mouth,
[2390.00 → 2390.88] of relationship,
[2390.88 → 2394.72] to see all the dark and broken places in our lives,
[2394.86 → 2398.00] and to see them as the truest parts of who we are.
[2399.56 → 2399.72] Right?
[2399.74 → 2400.74] Have you ever had that feeling?
[2401.08 → 2405.10] Like this thing that you wish you hadn't said,
[2405.86 → 2408.24] or this thing that you wish you hadn't done,
[2409.10 → 2411.80] or this pattern that shows up in your life again,
[2412.60 → 2414.74] where you think that is the truest thing about me.
[2415.46 → 2417.42] And like anything else I managed to do,
[2417.42 → 2418.76] it just feels like pretend,
[2418.90 → 2419.84] like icing on the cake.
[2419.84 → 2422.22] But it is not true of me.
[2422.96 → 2423.08] Right?
[2423.14 → 2424.04] Do you ever feel that way?
[2424.60 → 2425.10] I do.
[2426.10 → 2427.82] But the Bible tells us something different.
[2428.52 → 2430.58] The Bible is clear that we do sin,
[2430.88 → 2433.76] but the Bible doesn't reduce us to our sin.
[2434.74 → 2434.90] Right?
[2434.94 → 2436.04] The Bible teaches us that,
[2436.30 → 2437.34] yes, our sin is real.
[2437.90 → 2439.76] Yes, our sin dogs us.
[2439.88 → 2441.02] But because of Jesus,
[2441.14 → 2443.62] our sin no longer defines us.
[2443.62 → 2445.90] It no longer defines us.
[2446.62 → 2447.82] Because in Jesus,
[2447.82 → 2450.70] the old self with all of its sin is dead.
[2451.50 → 2454.38] It does not fundamentally define us anymore.
[2454.78 → 2455.22] Right?
[2455.26 → 2456.82] It didn't survive the crucifixion.
[2456.88 → 2459.56] It was put to death with Jesus.
[2459.56 → 2462.00] And so it will no longer define us,
[2462.02 → 2463.02] either now or in the future.
[2463.68 → 2465.24] So because of our union with Jesus,
[2465.62 → 2469.60] we can see that our old self no longer defines us.
[2470.14 → 2471.46] So let me ask you a question,
[2471.94 → 2474.18] by way of application here.
[2474.18 → 2480.92] Where are you letting sin define your identity?
[2481.92 → 2485.50] Where are you letting sin define who you are?
[2486.64 → 2488.36] Like when you wake up in the morning,
[2488.92 → 2490.18] when you think about your sin,
[2490.48 → 2493.08] do you believe the story
[2493.08 → 2495.72] that that is the truest part of who you are?
[2497.10 → 2497.32] Right?
[2497.34 → 2498.68] It would be so easy to do that.
[2499.10 → 2499.30] Right?
[2499.34 → 2500.30] To wake up in the morning,
[2500.46 → 2501.04] to get up,
[2501.04 → 2504.10] and to think about all the stupid sins
[2504.10 → 2505.76] that I have done in my life,
[2505.84 → 2506.34] and to think,
[2507.70 → 2508.86] that's, sorry,
[2509.44 → 2510.46] that's just who I am.
[2511.86 → 2513.76] But that's not what the Bible says, friends.
[2513.86 → 2515.04] That's not what the Bible says.
[2515.18 → 2517.78] The Bible says that I died in Christ.
[2517.86 → 2520.76] My old self is dead.
[2521.42 → 2524.14] It no longer defines who I am.
[2524.20 → 2526.40] I'm not defined by my sin any longer.
[2527.24 → 2528.96] So I want to challenge you
[2528.96 → 2531.04] to think about the places
[2531.04 → 2533.70] where you are continuing to be dogged
[2533.70 → 2535.10] by this old identity
[2535.10 → 2538.06] that you are just defined by your sin,
[2538.26 → 2540.14] and I want to encourage you
[2540.14 → 2541.58] to renounce it.
[2542.74 → 2544.92] It's not who you are any longer.
[2546.64 → 2547.76] Okay, so that's our identity.
[2547.90 → 2549.40] We have to have this identity of death.
[2549.86 → 2550.52] But secondly,
[2551.52 → 2553.10] as we enter into death,
[2553.14 → 2554.66] it's not just about a new identity,
[2554.66 → 2556.24] it's about a life of death.
[2557.16 → 2558.16] That sounds fun, right?
[2558.16 → 2560.30] A life of death.
[2561.40 → 2562.54] What this means
[2562.54 → 2564.48] is that the work of renewal
[2564.48 → 2565.94] into the image of Jesus
[2565.94 → 2568.62] is not just that we recognize
[2568.62 → 2570.24] that our old self is dead,
[2570.74 → 2572.42] we're actually to kill
[2572.42 → 2573.96] the parts of the old self
[2573.96 → 2575.90] that actually do remain in our lives.
[2577.06 → 2578.34] This is what Paul says,
[2578.90 → 2581.16] beginning in verse 5.
[2581.66 → 2582.80] Look at it with me here.
[2582.80 → 2585.70] Put to death, therefore,
[2586.68 → 2587.68] whatever belongs
[2587.68 → 2588.68] to your earthly nature,
[2589.28 → 2590.16] sexual immorality,
[2590.38 → 2591.22] impurity, lust,
[2591.34 → 2592.46] evil desires, and greed,
[2592.78 → 2593.68] which is idolatry.
[2594.08 → 2594.92] Because of these,
[2594.98 → 2596.00] the wrath of God is coming.
[2596.52 → 2598.12] You used to walk in these ways,
[2598.20 → 2599.48] in the life you once lived,
[2600.00 → 2601.94] but now you must also rid yourselves
[2601.94 → 2603.14] of such things as these,
[2603.74 → 2605.68] anger, rage, malice, slander,
[2606.08 → 2607.50] and filthy language from your lips.
[2608.26 → 2609.26] Okay, so he's saying,
[2609.26 → 2611.22] now that you have died with Christ,
[2611.98 → 2613.92] you are now to put to death
[2613.92 → 2616.70] the residues of the old self.
[2617.94 → 2619.50] And over the course of his letters,
[2620.22 → 2622.28] Paul tells us all kinds of things
[2622.28 → 2624.04] that we are to put to death
[2624.04 → 2624.72] in our lives.
[2625.46 → 2626.76] Right, there are all kinds of things
[2626.76 → 2628.94] that the Bible talks about,
[2629.76 → 2631.22] but today in this passage,
[2631.40 → 2632.46] he mentions a couple of things.
[2633.22 → 2635.90] First, he talks about sins of the body.
[2636.88 → 2637.84] So do you notice that?
[2637.84 → 2639.78] He says, he talks about sins of the body.
[2639.88 → 2641.64] He talks about sexual immorality.
[2642.08 → 2643.24] And that's just a word that means
[2643.24 → 2644.44] sex outside of marriage.
[2645.16 → 2647.08] He talks about sins of the heart,
[2648.04 → 2650.80] lust, evil desires, greed.
[2651.32 → 2652.60] He calls this idolatry.
[2653.76 → 2655.12] He talks about sins of the mouth,
[2655.42 → 2657.94] of the tongue, lying, slander,
[2658.46 → 2659.96] filthy language from your lips.
[2661.02 → 2663.14] He talks about sins of relationship.
[2663.70 → 2666.08] He talks about anger, malice,
[2666.08 → 2667.70] which are directed towards other people.
[2668.74 → 2670.48] So Paul tells us that all of these
[2670.48 → 2672.34] are works of the old self.
[2673.20 → 2674.72] And part of being renewed as people
[2674.72 → 2675.86] into the image of Christ
[2675.86 → 2679.58] is to enter into those places in our lives
[2679.58 → 2681.42] and to put those things to death,
[2681.78 → 2684.46] to no longer walk in them.
[2685.90 → 2687.22] So I want to ask you,
[2687.30 → 2688.16] by way of application,
[2689.16 → 2690.44] where in your life
[2690.44 → 2692.30] do you need to put
[2692.30 → 2694.44] these old things to death?
[2694.44 → 2697.70] Is it sins of the body
[2697.70 → 2699.46] in our sexuality?
[2700.40 → 2701.82] Is it sins of the heart?
[2702.62 → 2702.74] Right?
[2702.82 → 2704.52] Are we, you know,
[2704.60 → 2706.68] on the outside in company,
[2706.78 → 2708.32] maybe very polite, very kind,
[2708.44 → 2709.62] but actually in our hearts
[2709.62 → 2710.80] we are just harbouring
[2710.80 → 2712.62] all kinds of dark thoughts?
[2714.18 → 2714.66] Right?
[2714.70 → 2716.30] What about sins of speech?
[2716.30 → 2718.62] Do we lie?
[2719.52 → 2721.70] Or do we slander or gossip?
[2723.14 → 2723.62] Right?
[2723.68 → 2724.96] These are things that we can
[2724.96 → 2726.52] help one another put to death
[2726.52 → 2727.16] in our lives.
[2727.60 → 2729.24] And that's where the renewal
[2729.24 → 2730.52] of the person begins,
[2730.64 → 2732.18] is to enter into this death.
[2733.44 → 2734.04] To have,
[2734.12 → 2735.64] to know that our old selves
[2735.64 → 2736.84] are dead with Christ.
[2737.24 → 2738.08] And then we are told
[2738.08 → 2739.36] to live that out
[2739.36 → 2740.38] by putting to death
[2740.38 → 2741.18] the deeds of the body.
[2742.10 → 2742.94] Entering into death.
[2743.38 → 2744.38] But there's a second part.
[2745.38 → 2746.44] The second aspect
[2746.44 → 2747.80] of being renewed in ourselves
[2747.80 → 2749.18] is that we are
[2749.18 → 2750.64] emerging into life.
[2751.66 → 2752.44] And one of the most
[2752.44 → 2753.38] amazing things
[2753.38 → 2754.08] about the Bible,
[2754.26 → 2755.28] that the Bible teaches us
[2755.28 → 2756.40] about the Christian life,
[2756.54 → 2757.70] is that it is a life
[2757.70 → 2758.98] that is united
[2758.98 → 2761.12] to the resurrected Jesus.
[2762.12 → 2763.36] The resurrected life of Jesus.
[2764.30 → 2764.44] Right?
[2764.50 → 2765.68] So this very life
[2765.68 → 2766.94] that you live right now.
[2767.44 → 2767.64] Right?
[2767.70 → 2768.64] You got up this morning.
[2769.30 → 2769.76] I know that
[2769.76 → 2770.20] because you're here.
[2770.20 → 2771.50] You got up this morning.
[2771.92 → 2773.22] You brushed your teeth.
[2774.08 → 2775.12] Maybe some people know that
[2775.12 → 2775.92] from the greeting time.
[2777.22 → 2778.54] You had breakfast.
[2779.32 → 2779.56] Anyway,
[2780.18 → 2781.52] this ordinary life
[2781.52 → 2782.28] that you live
[2782.28 → 2785.32] is actually reflecting
[2785.32 → 2787.22] the very resurrection glory
[2787.22 → 2788.08] of Jesus Christ.
[2789.02 → 2790.20] That's what the Bible says.
[2791.62 → 2792.54] And so Paul says
[2792.54 → 2793.40] that we are supposed,
[2793.96 → 2794.86] what we're supposed to do
[2794.86 → 2795.40] as people
[2795.40 → 2797.36] is to emerge
[2797.36 → 2798.66] into this life.
[2798.66 → 2800.06] And again,
[2800.32 → 2801.34] this text suggests
[2801.34 → 2802.04] that we do this
[2802.04 → 2803.16] predictably in two ways.
[2803.90 → 2804.34] First,
[2804.94 → 2806.22] it means embracing
[2806.22 → 2807.56] an identity of life.
[2808.48 → 2809.64] So listen to what Paul says here.
[2810.46 → 2811.36] Notice the richness
[2811.36 → 2812.56] of the language he uses.
[2812.94 → 2813.34] We're going to look
[2813.34 → 2813.98] at a couple of verses.
[2814.14 → 2814.66] Verse one,
[2815.64 → 2816.30] since then,
[2816.66 → 2817.36] you have been raised
[2817.36 → 2817.98] with Christ.
[2818.54 → 2819.24] Set your mind,
[2819.44 → 2820.14] your hearts on things
[2820.14 → 2821.42] above where Christ is,
[2821.50 → 2822.34] seated at the right hand
[2822.34 → 2822.70] of God.
[2822.70 → 2823.20] See?
[2823.52 → 2824.26] You have been raised
[2824.26 → 2825.06] with Christ.
[2826.54 → 2827.44] Verse four,
[2828.28 → 2829.72] when Christ,
[2829.94 → 2831.14] who is your life,
[2831.36 → 2831.68] appears,
[2832.18 → 2833.30] then you will also appear
[2833.30 → 2834.00] with him in glory.
[2835.40 → 2836.30] Verse 10,
[2837.60 → 2839.02] and you have put on
[2839.02 → 2839.98] the new self,
[2840.18 → 2841.36] which is being renewed
[2841.36 → 2842.28] in the knowledge,
[2842.64 → 2843.10] in the image,
[2843.34 → 2843.86] in knowledge
[2843.86 → 2844.30] in the image
[2844.30 → 2844.98] of his creator.
[2845.98 → 2846.68] And then verse 12,
[2847.48 → 2849.48] you are God's chosen people,
[2850.32 → 2850.72] holy,
[2851.06 → 2851.84] dearly loved.
[2851.84 → 2855.96] In these words,
[2856.36 → 2857.58] Paul teaches us
[2857.58 → 2860.22] that just as our old identity
[2860.22 → 2861.18] was defined
[2861.18 → 2862.68] by Jesus' crucifixion,
[2863.14 → 2864.30] our new identity
[2864.30 → 2865.24] is defined
[2865.24 → 2866.10] by his resurrection.
[2867.58 → 2868.82] This is how Paul,
[2869.60 → 2871.56] who is no slouch
[2871.56 → 2872.36] when it comes
[2872.36 → 2873.26] to pointing out sin,
[2874.04 → 2875.34] this is how he describes you.
[2876.14 → 2877.40] Not only are you
[2877.40 → 2878.52] crucified with Jesus,
[2878.86 → 2880.12] you are raised with Jesus.
[2880.12 → 2882.08] You are loved by him.
[2882.46 → 2882.96] In him,
[2883.04 → 2883.96] you can actually
[2883.96 → 2884.86] do good things
[2884.86 → 2885.62] in this world again.
[2886.54 → 2887.98] You can be holy again
[2887.98 → 2889.82] because in him,
[2889.90 → 2890.92] you are being renewed
[2890.92 → 2891.76] in the image of God.
[2892.62 → 2893.70] And that's the truth
[2893.70 → 2895.22] about who we are right now
[2895.22 → 2896.26] because of our union
[2896.26 → 2897.08] with Jesus Christ.
[2897.48 → 2898.04] So whatever
[2898.04 → 2900.48] you think about yourselves,
[2901.12 → 2902.20] about who you are,
[2902.72 → 2904.62] that is who God says you are.
[2905.60 → 2906.68] You are loved.
[2907.22 → 2908.22] You are beloved.
[2908.92 → 2909.14] Right?
[2909.14 → 2909.92] You are holy.
[2910.20 → 2910.94] You are chosen.
[2911.42 → 2912.58] You are risen with Christ.
[2914.52 → 2916.08] So just as being renewed
[2916.08 → 2916.90] in ourselves
[2916.90 → 2917.74] means entering
[2917.74 → 2919.12] into an identity of death
[2919.12 → 2920.62] and a new status
[2920.62 → 2921.70] and now requires
[2921.70 → 2922.64] that we enter
[2922.64 → 2924.04] into this identity of life
[2924.04 → 2924.48] and that we are
[2924.48 → 2925.58] to understand ourselves
[2925.58 → 2925.96] anew
[2925.96 → 2926.84] in this new way.
[2928.24 → 2929.52] So by way of application,
[2929.66 → 2930.48] let me ask you a question.
[2931.62 → 2932.50] Do you think
[2932.50 → 2933.42] of yourself
[2933.42 → 2934.10] as someone
[2934.10 → 2935.76] who has the identity
[2935.76 → 2936.82] of the risen Jesus?
[2938.04 → 2938.72] Like that,
[2938.78 → 2939.74] that is the most
[2939.74 → 2941.26] true thing about you,
[2941.26 → 2943.36] that you have
[2943.36 → 2943.96] the life
[2943.96 → 2945.20] of the living God
[2945.20 → 2946.08] in your life.
[2947.14 → 2948.38] And what would it look like
[2948.38 → 2949.16] for you to embrace
[2949.16 → 2950.20] a resurrection identity?
[2950.20 → 2953.52] But it's not just about
[2953.52 → 2954.34] embracing this
[2954.34 → 2955.56] identity of life,
[2955.64 → 2956.26] but there's also
[2956.26 → 2957.66] living out this life
[2957.66 → 2959.06] of life.
[2960.18 → 2960.88] Living out the life
[2960.88 → 2961.46] of resurrection
[2961.46 → 2962.74] that makes more sense.
[2963.76 → 2965.08] And that's the second part here
[2965.08 → 2966.00] and this is the final part.
[2966.78 → 2967.88] So because the work
[2967.88 → 2968.66] of renewing
[2968.66 → 2969.42] this person
[2969.42 → 2970.66] requires us
[2970.66 → 2971.34] to understand
[2971.34 → 2972.46] not only that we have
[2972.46 → 2973.62] this identity
[2973.62 → 2974.26] of life,
[2974.42 → 2975.44] we are united
[2975.44 → 2976.48] with the risen Christ,
[2976.64 → 2977.92] that is what defines us now,
[2977.98 → 2978.84] we have a new status,
[2978.84 → 2979.98] but also now
[2979.98 → 2980.44] we are supposed
[2980.44 → 2981.62] to live that out
[2981.62 → 2983.76] on a day-to-day basis.
[2984.52 → 2985.66] In other words,
[2985.72 → 2986.46] every day
[2986.46 → 2987.92] when you get up,
[2988.64 → 2990.28] you are to embody
[2990.28 → 2991.48] the resurrection
[2991.48 → 2992.32] life of Jesus.
[2993.84 → 2994.92] We're trying to live
[2994.92 → 2995.46] in that way
[2995.46 → 2996.40] because that is
[2996.40 → 2996.98] who we are.
[2997.82 → 2998.66] So listen to what Paul
[2998.66 → 2999.44] says in our passage.
[3000.48 → 3001.00] Verse 1,
[3002.90 → 3003.78] Since then you have
[3003.78 → 3004.70] been raised with Christ,
[3005.26 → 3006.26] set your hearts
[3006.26 → 3007.02] on things above,
[3007.40 → 3008.24] where Christ is
[3008.24 → 3008.96] seated at the right
[3008.96 → 3009.50] hand of God.
[3010.66 → 3011.62] Now let's pick up
[3011.62 → 3013.02] the passage again
[3013.02 → 3015.12] in verse 12
[3015.12 → 3016.10] and I just want
[3016.10 → 3016.86] to read again
[3016.86 → 3017.34] all the way
[3017.34 → 3018.14] to verse 17.
[3019.46 → 3020.42] Listen to
[3020.42 → 3022.38] the words of life
[3022.38 → 3024.10] that describe
[3024.10 → 3025.20] the life of resurrection
[3025.20 → 3026.04] that he uses here.
[3026.88 → 3027.32] Therefore,
[3027.98 → 3029.52] as God's chosen people,
[3030.22 → 3031.32] holy and dearly beloved,
[3031.42 → 3031.50] right,
[3031.54 → 3032.24] that's your status,
[3032.68 → 3032.92] therefore,
[3033.28 → 3033.86] because this is
[3033.86 → 3034.44] who you are,
[3035.16 → 3035.72] what do we do?
[3035.80 → 3036.56] How do we live this out?
[3036.56 → 3038.08] So, clothe yourselves
[3038.08 → 3038.96] with compassion,
[3039.72 → 3041.02] kindness, humility,
[3041.58 → 3042.64] gentleness, and patience.
[3043.30 → 3044.16] Bear with each other.
[3044.58 → 3045.50] Forgive one another
[3045.50 → 3046.58] if any of you
[3046.58 → 3047.40] has a grievance
[3047.40 → 3048.06] against someone.
[3049.34 → 3050.34] Forgive as the Lord
[3050.34 → 3051.20] has forgiven you.
[3052.32 → 3052.46] Right?
[3052.50 → 3054.64] That's another line, okay?
[3054.78 → 3055.90] What's your new status?
[3056.62 → 3057.06] Forgiven.
[3057.60 → 3058.84] How do you live that out?
[3059.78 → 3060.10] Forgive.
[3060.10 → 3062.86] And over all of these virtues,
[3062.98 → 3063.64] put on love,
[3063.84 → 3064.64] which binds them
[3064.64 → 3065.38] to all together
[3065.38 → 3066.20] in perfect unity.
[3066.74 → 3067.82] Let the peace of Christ
[3067.82 → 3068.90] rule in your hearts,
[3069.26 → 3069.96] since as members
[3069.96 → 3070.66] of one body
[3070.66 → 3071.76] you are called to peace
[3071.76 → 3072.64] and be thankful.
[3074.14 → 3075.60] Let the message of Christ
[3075.60 → 3077.34] dwell among you richly
[3077.34 → 3078.44] as you teach
[3078.44 → 3079.76] and admonish one another
[3079.76 → 3080.78] with all wisdom
[3080.78 → 3082.02] through psalms,
[3082.16 → 3082.58] hymns,
[3082.86 → 3083.68] songs from the Spirit,
[3084.26 → 3085.02] singing to God
[3085.02 → 3085.60] with gratitude
[3085.60 → 3086.38] in your hearts.
[3086.80 → 3087.66] Whatever you do,
[3087.92 → 3088.86] whether in word or deed,
[3088.96 → 3089.54] do it all
[3089.54 → 3090.12] in the name
[3090.12 → 3090.90] of the Lord Jesus,
[3091.64 → 3092.38] giving thanks
[3092.38 → 3093.32] to God the Father
[3093.32 → 3094.00] through him.
[3098.32 → 3099.36] That is
[3099.36 → 3101.44] resurrection life.
[3102.46 → 3102.58] Right?
[3102.64 → 3103.76] And that is what Paul
[3103.76 → 3104.90] is calling us
[3104.90 → 3106.00] to embody,
[3106.16 → 3106.80] to live out.
[3107.26 → 3108.26] And it includes
[3108.26 → 3109.42] resurrected minds
[3109.42 → 3110.94] where he says,
[3111.26 → 3111.98] set your minds
[3111.98 → 3112.76] on things above.
[3112.94 → 3113.08] Right?
[3113.10 → 3113.52] He's saying,
[3113.52 → 3114.66] I want you not to be
[3114.66 → 3115.20] distracted
[3115.20 → 3116.30] by all the stuff
[3116.30 → 3116.90] around you,
[3116.98 → 3117.58] but I want you
[3117.58 → 3118.64] to meditate on Jesus.
[3118.64 → 3120.86] He wants us
[3120.86 → 3121.22] to have
[3121.22 → 3122.50] resurrected hearts.
[3123.08 → 3123.60] Right?
[3123.68 → 3124.20] That are marked
[3124.20 → 3125.14] by compassion,
[3125.96 → 3126.54] humility,
[3126.80 → 3127.24] kindness,
[3127.70 → 3128.24] gentleness,
[3128.68 → 3129.14] gratitude.
[3130.00 → 3131.08] Is that hard
[3131.08 → 3131.56] for anyone?
[3132.80 → 3133.68] Don't raise your hands.
[3135.22 → 3136.32] But we can work
[3136.32 → 3136.96] on this together.
[3137.44 → 3137.66] Right?
[3137.74 → 3138.56] We can learn
[3138.56 → 3139.20] these things
[3139.20 → 3140.38] because we have
[3140.38 → 3141.26] the resurrection
[3141.26 → 3142.02] life of Jesus.
[3142.14 → 3142.62] We are able
[3142.62 → 3143.24] to do this.
[3144.10 → 3144.74] He wants us
[3144.74 → 3144.98] to have
[3144.98 → 3146.24] resurrected relationships
[3146.24 → 3147.90] which are characterized
[3147.90 → 3148.74] by bearing
[3148.74 → 3149.54] with one another,
[3149.74 → 3150.60] by forgiveness,
[3151.04 → 3151.66] and by love.
[3152.64 → 3153.28] He wants us
[3153.28 → 3154.66] to have resurrection speech
[3154.66 → 3156.32] where before
[3156.32 → 3157.18] we were lying
[3157.18 → 3158.00] and slandering,
[3158.58 → 3159.34] but what are we
[3159.34 → 3160.14] supposed to do now?
[3161.18 → 3162.86] Sing songs.
[3163.76 → 3164.76] We're supposed to sing.
[3165.54 → 3166.36] We're supposed to
[3166.36 → 3168.16] speak words of love.
[3168.82 → 3169.46] We're supposed to
[3169.46 → 3170.52] speak words of truth.
[3171.16 → 3172.12] That's the resurrection
[3172.12 → 3172.90] of our tongues.
[3173.86 → 3174.52] And then we're to have
[3174.52 → 3175.94] this resurrection ambition
[3175.94 → 3176.88] where everything
[3176.88 → 3177.98] we do
[3177.98 → 3179.10] is done
[3179.10 → 3179.94] in the name
[3179.94 → 3181.38] of Jesus Christ.
[3182.28 → 3183.26] Everything we do,
[3183.40 → 3184.40] every ordinary thing
[3184.40 → 3185.00] in your life,
[3185.70 → 3185.94] you say,
[3186.02 → 3187.04] why am I doing this?
[3187.80 → 3188.74] For the glory
[3188.74 → 3189.76] of Jesus Christ.
[3190.26 → 3191.06] It's for him.
[3192.18 → 3192.54] And so,
[3192.66 → 3193.70] these are the characteristics
[3193.70 → 3194.52] of the new life.
[3194.92 → 3195.66] And even though
[3195.66 → 3196.28] you and I
[3196.28 → 3197.50] struggle with sin,
[3197.96 → 3199.46] we can grow
[3199.46 → 3200.78] in these ways
[3200.78 → 3201.82] over the course
[3201.82 → 3202.38] of our life.
[3202.38 → 3204.20] So I'm going to ask
[3204.20 → 3205.08] you our last question
[3205.08 → 3206.02] by way of application.
[3207.22 → 3208.80] Where in your life
[3208.80 → 3210.24] does the resurrection
[3210.24 → 3210.92] of Jesus
[3210.92 → 3212.04] need to take
[3212.04 → 3213.04] more concrete shape?
[3214.60 → 3215.92] Is it in what
[3215.92 → 3216.58] you think about
[3216.58 → 3217.80] where you set
[3217.80 → 3218.26] your mind?
[3219.38 → 3220.22] Is it about
[3220.22 → 3221.20] what's going on
[3221.20 → 3221.82] in your heart?
[3222.68 → 3223.48] Is it in your
[3223.48 → 3224.02] relationships
[3224.02 → 3224.68] where you need
[3224.68 → 3225.48] the resurrection
[3225.48 → 3226.44] of Jesus
[3226.44 → 3227.42] to come into
[3227.42 → 3228.14] your relationships?
[3228.14 → 3231.22] is it in your words
[3231.22 → 3232.36] to speak words
[3232.36 → 3232.86] of love
[3232.86 → 3233.46] and truth?
[3234.48 → 3235.32] Is it in the
[3235.32 → 3236.62] ambitions of your life
[3236.62 → 3237.32] to live not
[3237.32 → 3238.08] for yourself
[3238.08 → 3239.76] but for Jesus
[3239.76 → 3240.66] and for his glory?
[3241.38 → 3241.58] Right?
[3241.62 → 3242.20] These are just some
[3242.20 → 3243.00] things to think about.
[3244.50 → 3245.48] So what it means
[3245.48 → 3246.12] to be renewed
[3246.12 → 3246.86] in ourselves?
[3247.24 → 3247.74] What does it mean
[3247.74 → 3248.72] that God
[3248.72 → 3249.26] is renewing
[3249.26 → 3250.12] all things?
[3250.82 → 3251.32] And that part
[3251.32 → 3252.08] of what that means
[3252.08 → 3253.56] is that you
[3253.56 → 3254.56] are being renewed.
[3254.56 → 3258.18] What it means
[3258.18 → 3259.18] is that we must
[3259.18 → 3260.28] enter into death.
[3260.72 → 3261.68] We must do the work
[3261.68 → 3262.66] of entering into death.
[3263.16 → 3264.52] And we must also
[3264.52 → 3265.66] emerge into life.
[3266.16 → 3266.92] Into the identity
[3266.92 → 3267.62] of life
[3267.62 → 3269.00] and also a life
[3269.00 → 3269.70] of resurrection
[3269.70 → 3271.10] where we follow
[3271.10 → 3271.86] the life of Jesus
[3271.86 → 3272.84] in our own lives.
[3274.14 → 3274.68] Okay, so let me
[3274.68 → 3275.24] conclude here.
[3277.82 → 3279.10] It was pretty amazing
[3279.10 → 3280.58] to crawl through
[3280.58 → 3281.62] the cave
[3281.62 → 3283.08] of Abdullah.
[3283.08 → 3283.88] I said it.
[3283.88 → 3284.80] Abdullah.
[3285.54 → 3287.56] To be in the very place
[3287.56 → 3288.88] where David
[3288.88 → 3289.84] was hiding
[3289.84 → 3290.88] from Saul.
[3291.52 → 3292.26] Where he wrote
[3292.26 → 3293.26] some of these psalms.
[3294.34 → 3294.98] And after,
[3295.22 → 3295.58] as I said,
[3295.64 → 3296.58] we were halfway through,
[3296.72 → 3297.60] the reason why
[3297.60 → 3298.30] we decided
[3298.30 → 3299.28] we were doing this
[3299.28 → 3300.36] was again
[3300.36 → 3301.38] to press
[3301.38 → 3302.26] toward the light
[3302.26 → 3303.06] on the other side.
[3304.06 → 3304.72] And so,
[3305.10 → 3306.54] we kept squeezing
[3306.54 → 3308.38] through these dark,
[3308.76 → 3309.44] narrow tunnels.
[3310.06 → 3310.90] And finally,
[3311.18 → 3311.98] we knew that
[3311.98 → 3312.48] we were getting
[3312.48 → 3313.08] to the end
[3313.08 → 3314.64] because up ahead
[3314.64 → 3315.96] around the bend
[3315.96 → 3317.02] we could see light
[3317.02 → 3319.74] starting to stream in.
[3321.54 → 3322.16] And so,
[3322.28 → 3322.90] what happens is
[3322.90 → 3324.02] we crawled our
[3324.02 → 3324.96] and we came out
[3324.96 → 3325.82] into the light.
[3326.18 → 3327.52] And as we emerged,
[3327.60 → 3328.14] this whole group
[3328.14 → 3329.96] of people we were with,
[3330.18 → 3330.92] what were they doing?
[3331.92 → 3332.86] They were cheering.
[3334.24 → 3335.48] They were celebrating.
[3335.48 → 3337.08] we were encouraging
[3337.08 → 3337.78] one another
[3337.78 → 3339.00] and each one of us
[3339.00 → 3340.76] emerged into the light
[3340.76 → 3342.64] to the sounds
[3342.64 → 3343.76] of joy.
[3344.68 → 3345.90] That was the best part
[3345.90 → 3346.84] of this experience.
[3347.50 → 3348.60] Standing in the light
[3348.60 → 3349.48] of the open air
[3349.48 → 3350.42] after having come
[3350.42 → 3351.04] through that tunnel
[3351.04 → 3352.54] and experiencing
[3352.54 → 3353.92] the joy of life.
[3354.62 → 3355.28] For me,
[3355.42 → 3356.40] this was a vision
[3356.40 → 3357.42] of what it means
[3357.42 → 3358.62] for us to pursue
[3358.62 → 3359.42] this life together.
[3359.42 → 3360.70] You know,
[3360.76 → 3361.92] we are all on this
[3361.92 → 3363.38] path of God
[3363.38 → 3364.16] and sometimes
[3364.16 → 3364.98] it leads through
[3364.98 → 3365.66] dark places.
[3366.44 → 3367.48] And we are struggling
[3367.48 → 3370.12] and we are pushing through
[3370.12 → 3371.16] and sometimes we say,
[3371.48 → 3372.06] I don't know
[3372.06 → 3372.98] if I'm going to make it.
[3373.16 → 3373.52] Or we say,
[3373.66 → 3374.94] why am I doing this?
[3375.70 → 3376.98] But I want you to know
[3376.98 → 3378.34] that you are going to make it
[3378.34 → 3380.74] because Jesus is with you
[3380.74 → 3382.34] and you are united to him
[3382.34 → 3383.24] in his death
[3383.24 → 3384.62] and in his resurrection.
[3384.94 → 3385.62] And one day,
[3385.68 → 3386.48] because of the grace
[3386.48 → 3386.94] of Jesus,
[3387.14 → 3388.44] you are going to emerge
[3388.44 → 3389.22] out of the darkness
[3389.22 → 3390.90] and into the light
[3390.90 → 3392.32] of holy joy.
[3393.46 → 3394.36] That's our future.
[3394.72 → 3395.60] So I want us to think
[3395.60 → 3396.44] about our church
[3396.44 → 3396.98] in this way.
[3397.68 → 3398.60] Think about yourselves
[3398.60 → 3399.62] as a church in this way
[3399.62 → 3400.30] that we are all
[3400.30 → 3400.96] on this journey
[3400.96 → 3402.24] of renewal together.
[3403.50 → 3403.68] Okay,
[3403.72 → 3404.46] let's pray together.
[3407.64 → 3408.38] Heavenly Father,
[3408.50 → 3409.34] we thank you for
[3409.34 → 3410.94] the renewal
[3410.94 → 3412.42] of our own selves.
[3413.62 → 3414.04] Father,
[3414.14 → 3415.42] so often in our lives
[3415.42 → 3417.80] we wake up
[3417.80 → 3418.74] and we wonder
[3418.74 → 3420.22] if our sin
[3420.22 → 3421.98] actually defines
[3421.98 → 3422.54] who we are.
[3423.68 → 3424.30] But Lord,
[3424.38 → 3425.02] there is
[3425.02 → 3426.62] what is true
[3426.62 → 3427.28] about us
[3427.28 → 3428.72] that by faith
[3428.72 → 3429.30] in Christ
[3429.30 → 3431.34] we have a new identity
[3431.34 → 3432.40] and we are called
[3432.40 → 3433.08] to live out
[3433.08 → 3433.84] a new life
[3433.84 → 3434.66] and you call us
[3434.66 → 3435.20] to live it out
[3435.20 → 3436.30] because we can do it.
[3437.14 → 3438.24] Because you are with us
[3438.24 → 3439.02] and you are helping us.
[3439.14 → 3439.24] Lord,
[3439.32 → 3440.34] help us to be renewed
[3440.34 → 3441.70] in ourselves
[3441.70 → 3442.46] to your glory.
[3442.84 → 3443.84] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3444.16 → 3444.38] Amen.
[3444.38 → 3446.56] Let's stand
[3446.56 → 3447.16] and let's sing
[3447.16 → 3448.00] our song of response
[3448.00 → 3448.50] together.
[3448.50 → 3448.62] Amen.
[3448.62 → 3449.50] Let's stand
[3449.50 → 3451.08] and let's sing
[3451.08 → 3451.86] our song of response
[3451.86 → 3452.62] together.
[3452.62 → 3465.88] Will you come and follow me
[3465.88 → 3484.34] if I would call your name?
[3484.34 → 3488.06] Will you go where you don't know
[3488.06 → 3492.34] and never be the same?
[3492.34 → 3496.96] Will you let my love be shown?
[3497.44 → 3501.02] Will you let my name be known?
[3501.96 → 3506.24] Will you let my life be grown in you
[3506.24 → 3509.58] and you in me?
[3512.08 → 3514.66] Will you love the
[3514.66 → 3516.92] who hide it high
[3516.92 → 3520.66] but call your name?
[3520.66 → 3524.34] Will you quell the fear inside
[3524.34 → 3529.12] and never be the same?
[3529.12 → 3533.40] Will you use the faith you found
[3533.40 → 3537.96] to reshape the world around
[3537.96 → 3541.00] through my sight and touch
[3541.00 → 3543.04] and sound in you
[3543.04 → 3547.16] and you in me?
[3547.16 → 3553.62] Lord, your summons echoed true in you
[3553.62 → 3557.28] but call my name.
[3557.28 → 3560.90] Let me turn and follow you
[3560.90 → 3565.70] and never be the same.
[3565.70 → 3570.16] in your company of old
[3570.16 → 3574.44] where your love and footsteps show
[3574.44 → 3578.58] must I'll move and live and grow
[3578.58 → 3583.02] in you and your in me.
[3583.02 → 3585.58] Amen.
[3588.14 → 3588.68] Amen.
[3595.70 → 3598.52] So we'll continue to worship the Lord this morning
[3598.52 → 3600.72] by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3601.56 → 3602.72] You know, God created us
[3602.72 → 3604.38] in his image and likeness
[3604.38 → 3606.38] and he is renewing us
[3606.38 → 3607.84] and one of the ways he's renewing us
[3607.84 → 3609.62] is to be faithful stewards again
[3609.62 → 3611.54] of all that he has given us.
[3611.54 → 3617.06] And so that's why we give generously of our finances, of our time, of our talents,
[3617.06 → 3624.20] because all we have is his. So as the offering bags are passed, you can use the offering
[3624.20 → 3628.80] envelopes to give to our church budget as well as to our designated offerings today, which is
[3628.80 → 3633.58] one of our diaconal ministries called New Ground. And there's a flyer, I think, an insert in your
[3633.58 → 3638.40] bulletin where you can learn more about it. And you can also use this time to offer up
[3638.40 → 3644.32] your own prayers to God. So may I ask the deacons to come forward and collect the offering.

[3695.30 → 3696.30] Amen.
[3725.30 → 3727.30] Amen.
[3755.30 → 3756.30] Amen.
[3762.30 → 3764.44] So let's continue by going to the Lord in prayer.
[3765.54 → 3770.44] And as we pray, I will pray a couple of things.
[3770.58 → 3772.08] And after each one, I will pause.
[3772.26 → 3777.02] And I will say, Lord, in your mercy, I want to invite you to say in response, hear our prayer.
[3778.20 → 3779.30] So let's pray together.
[3781.46 → 3785.28] Almighty and loving God, we thank you for revealing yourself to us.
[3785.28 → 3787.20] Through your son, Jesus Christ.
[3788.36 → 3795.30] And as we walk through a world that is confusing, troubling, and insecure,
[3796.12 → 3800.16] we cling to the knowledge that we may know you.
[3801.08 → 3804.86] That you allow us to glimpse your glory in the face of Jesus.
[3806.48 → 3811.22] So Lord, would you stir up a greater desire in our hearts to seek you daily.
[3811.22 → 3818.36] And to experience your very real presence with us through the power of your Holy Spirit.
[3819.24 → 3821.82] Thank you that you do not leave us alone.
[3822.44 → 3824.84] But you promise to stay with us.
[3824.84 → 3829.16] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3830.86 → 3833.24] Lord, we pray for all of us.
[3833.86 → 3838.60] That we would look for opportunities to be your hands and feet in this world.
[3838.60 → 3844.32] We pray that you would make us more aware of our neighbours and those around us.
[3844.90 → 3848.36] And grant us patience and grace.
[3849.08 → 3851.88] Give us eyes to see the needs of the people around us.
[3851.94 → 3856.48] Whether it's our own families, our coworkers, or our neighbours.
[3856.48 → 3865.86] We pray that we would not be too busy, too self-focused to meet the needs that we see.
[3866.46 → 3868.96] But that we would spend time to listen.
[3869.74 → 3872.24] And that we would listen to the Spirit's promptings.
[3872.30 → 3874.44] Also to share the good news of Jesus.
[3875.18 → 3876.56] When we have an opportunity.
[3877.82 → 3880.80] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3880.80 → 3887.60] Jesus, friend of sinners and redeemer of the world.
[3888.32 → 3892.36] We pray for many broken things that need to be made right.
[3893.32 → 3897.16] We pray that you would bring peace where there is strife.
[3897.86 → 3900.56] That you would bring your justice where there is evil.
[3901.34 → 3904.54] That you would bring your truth where there are lies.
[3905.20 → 3910.72] We pray especially against the violence that we see in our world.
[3910.80 → 3915.00] That is often inflicted out of fear.
[3916.16 → 3918.32] Would you help us to steady our hearts.
[3918.42 → 3922.66] So that we might not succumb to the demand of our fears and our worries.
[3923.60 → 3926.62] Help us to keep our hearts from being troubled.
[3928.10 → 3931.02] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3932.60 → 3934.86] Holy Spirit, living breath of God.
[3935.66 → 3938.92] Breathe on your people in need of comfort and counsel.
[3938.92 → 3939.92] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3939.92 → 3944.06] We pray especially for the orphan, the widow, and the immigrant.
[3944.78 → 3947.60] We pray for those among us who are overlooked.
[3948.48 → 3951.86] Who are despairing, grieving, and cast down.
[3952.62 → 3954.34] And those suffering in any way.
[3955.62 → 3960.78] Lord Jesus, you know the difficulty and the limitations of living in this world in a human body.
[3960.78 → 3961.78] Lord, we pray for those who are in pain.
[3961.78 → 3965.64] Because you came, and you lived as a man among us.
[3966.24 → 3969.70] And so would you come and minister to those who are in pain.
[3970.04 → 3972.16] In body, or in mind, or in spirit.
[3973.24 → 3977.04] This morning we pray especially, Lord, for John and Nancy.
[3977.74 → 3978.52] For Grace.
[3979.18 → 3979.82] For Shirley.
[3980.02 → 3980.58] For Aline.
[3980.92 → 3981.52] For Amy.
[3982.08 → 3982.66] For Jordan.
[3982.66 → 3984.94] And Lord, many others.
[3986.40 → 3992.00] Lord, we all need your comfort and you're healing in our lives.
[3992.16 → 3994.30] In our bodies, in our hearts, in our minds.
[3995.82 → 4001.84] Lord, despite our present difficulties, would you draw us close to you.
[4002.58 → 4004.68] Comfort us by your loving kindness.
[4005.40 → 4008.38] And the assurance that we are yours forever.
[4009.40 → 4012.28] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4012.66 → 4015.46] And now we gather our prayers into one.
[4016.00 → 4018.98] And we pray the prayer that Jesus taught us.
[4019.64 → 4020.48] Saying together.
[4021.28 → 4023.44] Our Father in heaven.
[4024.16 → 4025.68] Hallowed be your name.
[4026.32 → 4027.50] Your kingdom come.
[4028.02 → 4031.42] Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4032.42 → 4034.40] Give us today our daily bread.
[4035.10 → 4036.54] And forgive us our debts.
[4036.86 → 4039.24] As we also have forgiven our debtors.
[4039.24 → 4041.74] And lead us not into temptation.
[4042.36 → 4044.34] But deliver us from the evil one.
[4044.96 → 4046.26] For yours is the kingdom.
[4046.86 → 4050.10] And the power and the glory now and forever.
[4050.90 → 4051.42] Amen.
[4052.76 → 4053.70] Please rise.
[4053.70 → 4059.50] And we will go out with God's word upon us.
[4059.50 → 4062.10] And a song on our lips.
[4062.48 → 4064.24] As Paul says in Colossians 3.
[4065.18 → 4067.10] So I invite you to hold out your hands.
[4067.26 → 4071.76] As a gesture of receiving the blessing that comes down from our Father.
[4071.76 → 4075.54] To him who is able to keep you from stumbling.
[4075.86 → 4079.14] And to present you before his glorious presence.
[4079.56 → 4080.54] Without fault.
[4081.04 → 4081.98] And with great joy.
[4082.44 → 4084.14] To the only God our Saviour.
[4084.28 → 4086.86] Be glory, majesty, power and authority.
[4087.34 → 4088.70] Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[4088.82 → 4089.86] Before all ages.
[4090.00 → 4091.52] Now and forevermore.
[4091.52 → 4092.50] Amen.
[4092.50 → 4106.30] Amen.
[4106.30 → 4128.28] Praise the Lord, from whom all blessings flow.
[4128.28 → 4138.28] He has washed and made me white as snow.
[4139.96 → 4149.72] I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[4149.72 → 4159.72] Now and forever, praise His holy name.

[4216.84 → 4218.84] Praise His holy name.
[4218.84 → 4222.84] That He alone is worthy.
