[317.00 --> 318.00]  Good morning, everyone.
[318.00 --> 323.00]  Come on in and have a seat.
[323.00 --> 330.00]  Welcome to Latin or Christian Reformed Church and happy Mother's Day.
[330.00 --> 339.34]  Thanks. So my name is Jason. I am one of the pastors here, and I have the privilege of leading us in worship today.
[339.34 --> 360.70]  We begin each Sunday with a call to worship, and this is our opportunity to get our hearts in the right place as we come eager to worship God as well as to hear from God all that we need for our hearts and for our lives.
[360.70 --> 375.34]  And as we hear and respond to the call to worship, we are reminded that it is worthwhile for us to be here because the God we worship is our God and we are his people.
[376.26 --> 380.74]  So please join with me in this call to worship from Psalm 118.
[380.74 --> 410.72]  Psalm 119.
[410.74 --> 440.48]  Let's bow our heads in prayer together. Let's come before this God in prayer.
[440.74 --> 451.78]  Father, we come humbly before you this morning, acknowledging that you are God and you are worthy of our praise.
[451.78 --> 459.14]  And it is because of that fact that we are here this morning, because you have summoned us into your presence.
[459.64 --> 465.76]  You have summoned the earth and every creature in it to acknowledge who you are and to worship you.
[465.76 --> 469.34]  And Father, we need to praise you.
[469.34 --> 472.00]  You designed and created us to praise you.
[472.90 --> 477.34]  You are the only one who is truly worthy of praise.
[477.34 --> 488.16]  And so it is right and good that we come before you and acknowledge you, acknowledge you for who you are and all of your greatness and glory and your majesty and holiness and splendor.
[488.16 --> 498.50]  And it is also for our own good because you alone can satisfy every desire of our hearts in a good and righteous way.
[498.50 --> 505.38]  You alone are the one who can heal the cracks in our broken hearts and in our broken world.
[506.32 --> 511.14]  And so we come before you this morning because you are life itself.
[511.14 --> 513.38]  And we offer you our lives.
[513.90 --> 518.94]  We call upon you to meet us here in this place as we offer you our praise.
[519.66 --> 521.20]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[521.80 --> 522.22]  Amen.
[522.22 --> 522.30]  Amen.
[523.50 --> 533.54]  So brothers and sisters, please stand for God's greeting to us this morning from Deuteronomy 6 and Matthew 22.
[534.80 --> 538.96]  Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone.
[540.04 --> 546.44]  Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your strength.
[547.20 --> 549.86]  And love your neighbor as yourself.
[549.86 --> 554.16]  So as God has called us and he has greeted us, let's turn.
[554.82 --> 556.74]  Let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[579.86 --> 581.92]  Thank you.
[584.82 --> 585.98]  Let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[586.52 --> 587.30]  Let's meet Istela.
[587.62 --> 590.00]  miten Cash of God is our humble honor.
[590.00 --> 590.28]  Let's number four in the name of the Lord.
[590.82 --> 592.58]  Let's welcome everyone.
[592.58 --> 593.22]  Let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[593.22 --> 594.04]  Let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[594.04 --> 596.10]  If you goodbye in the name of the Lord, please shine a light on us and beżyć for the Lord's glory.
[596.34 --> 597.32]  Let's greet the Lord as we wake up in the name of the Lord.
[597.32 --> 598.48]  Let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[598.52 --> 598.84]  Let's greet the Lord and the Lord naturally Duane.
[598.84 --> 600.12]  Come and to種 the Lord as we eat, in the a few ark.
[600.12 --> 601.92]  If we graduate, please read and leave it a light on our word.
[601.92 --> 603.68]  Let's greet other thousand.
[603.68 --> 604.96]  Aww and pray for the Lord and our Lord.
[604.96 --> 619.26]  Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord above.
[619.26 --> 626.98]  Hands on the life, flowers be flooring, opening to the sun above.
[627.44 --> 634.40]  Round the crowd to sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt to thee.
[634.40 --> 642.28]  Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.
[649.44 --> 657.02]  All our earth's to choice around the earth and heaven breathes memories.
[657.02 --> 665.34]  Stars and angels sail around the center of our groaned praise.
[665.74 --> 672.90]  Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flesh and soul.
[673.40 --> 680.02]  Chanting word and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee.
[680.02 --> 685.02]  Chanting word and mountain, flowery meadow, flesh and soul.
[685.02 --> 693.24]  Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed.
[693.72 --> 701.06]  Wellspring of the joy of giving, ocean depths of heavenly rest.
[701.06 --> 708.06]  Thou art Father, Christ our brother, all who live in love of mine.
[708.06 --> 716.06]  Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.
[716.06 --> 723.06]  Lord of the joy of giving, earth's to the joy of my life.
[723.06 --> 730.38]  Lord of the joy of the mighty chorus, brings the morning stars begin.
[730.38 --> 738.06]  Father of His reign in the house, brother of my man's man's man.
[738.06 --> 745.06]  Ever singing, Lord of the joy of the mighty chorus, brings the joy of my life.
[745.06 --> 755.06]  Joyful music lifts us on, learning the triumphs of the song of life.
[755.06 --> 775.06]  Joyful music lifts us on, learning the triumphs of the glory of the mighty chorus, brings the joy of the mighty chorus, brings the joy of the glory of the mighty chorus.
[775.06 --> 778.06]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[778.06 --> 785.06]  I want to see you.
[785.06 --> 790.06]  I want to see you.
[790.06 --> 796.06]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[796.06 --> 799.06]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[799.06 --> 800.06]  I want to see you.
[800.06 --> 801.06]  I want to see you.
[801.06 --> 802.06]  I want to see you.
[802.06 --> 806.06]  I want to see you.
[806.06 --> 812.06]  To see you high and lifted up.
[812.06 --> 817.06]  Shining in the light of your glory.
[817.06 --> 820.06]  Pour out your power and love.
[820.06 --> 824.06]  As we sing holy, holy, holy.
[824.06 --> 827.06]  Holy, holy, holy.
[827.06 --> 832.06]  Holy, holy, holy.
[832.06 --> 837.06]  Holy, holy, holy.
[837.06 --> 840.06]  Holy, holy, holy.
[840.06 --> 842.06]  Father of God, I want to see you.
[842.06 --> 848.06]  Holy, holy, holy.
[848.06 --> 852.26]  Holy, holy, holy
[852.26 --> 856.32]  Holy, holy, holy
[856.32 --> 859.86]  I want to see you
[859.86 --> 864.92]  See you high and lifted up
[864.92 --> 868.80]  Shining in the light of the glory
[868.80 --> 872.46]  For out your power and love
[872.46 --> 876.50]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[876.50 --> 881.22]  Holy, holy, holy
[881.22 --> 885.78]  Holy, holy, holy
[885.78 --> 889.24]  Holy, holy, holy
[889.24 --> 892.28]  I see you
[892.28 --> 897.42]  Holy, holy, holy
[897.42 --> 901.70]  Holy, holy, holy
[901.70 --> 905.72]  Holy, holy, whole
[905.72 --> 909.48]  I want to see you.
[918.44 --> 919.70]  You may be seated.
[924.22 --> 927.36]  So we continue to worship the Lord this morning
[927.36 --> 929.50]  in a time of confession and renewal.
[930.32 --> 933.62]  Our God is a consuming fire.
[933.62 --> 938.30]  He is so holy and righteous and good
[938.30 --> 943.62]  that it's not just that it is not allowed
[944.40 --> 946.28]  for sin to enter into his presence,
[946.46 --> 949.62]  it's that it's impossible for sin to enter his presence
[949.62 --> 953.34]  without the sinner being utterly destroyed.
[954.50 --> 958.22]  Because it's his holiness, I mean it's our sin
[958.22 --> 960.96]  that is in danger of the holiness of God.
[960.96 --> 965.90]  And that's not God being harsh or cruel
[965.90 --> 967.78]  to his fallen creatures.
[968.54 --> 971.70]  It's God being so righteous and so good
[971.70 --> 975.14]  that evil instantaneously evaporates
[975.14 --> 976.76]  in his glorious presence.
[977.56 --> 983.12]  God is so good that sin can't survive his goodness.
[984.14 --> 986.64]  His holiness and righteousness are so big
[986.64 --> 990.92]  and so powerful that our sin simply can't exist
[990.92 --> 992.34]  in his presence.
[992.90 --> 996.02]  And so in confession we come to terms with the fact
[996.02 --> 997.76]  that we are sinners.
[998.42 --> 1000.90]  And it's our own sin and our own wickedness
[1000.90 --> 1003.18]  that can't survive in God's goodness.
[1005.02 --> 1008.16]  But this holy and righteous and good God
[1008.16 --> 1010.00]  is also merciful.
[1010.60 --> 1011.92]  And he is also loving.
[1011.92 --> 1016.88]  And he provided Jesus so that when we turn to him in faith
[1016.88 --> 1020.92]  he covers our sin with his own righteousness.
[1021.96 --> 1024.30]  And this is the whole reason that we can come to him
[1024.30 --> 1025.50]  freely in confession.
[1025.94 --> 1030.64]  Because he is merciful to those who seek his mercy.
[1031.80 --> 1034.52]  He is merciful to those who claim that mercy
[1034.52 --> 1035.34]  in the name of Jesus.
[1035.34 --> 1040.26]  So let's take this time now to turn to our Lord
[1040.26 --> 1040.86]  in confession.
[1041.20 --> 1043.92]  We will read a prayer together responsibly.
[1044.32 --> 1045.34]  And then I'll give you a moment
[1045.34 --> 1050.14]  to allow the Holy Spirit to open our hearts
[1050.14 --> 1052.24]  just to rest and be quiet before him
[1052.24 --> 1054.78]  and allow him to examine us
[1054.78 --> 1058.00]  and for us to bring our sin before him
[1058.00 --> 1059.52]  and ask him for his mercy.
[1060.38 --> 1064.48]  So let's read this confession together responsibly.
[1064.48 --> 1064.96]  I'll begin.
[1066.12 --> 1070.36]  Merciful God, in your gracious presence
[1070.36 --> 1074.20]  we confess our sin and the sin of this world.
[1075.64 --> 1079.28]  Although Christ is among us as our peace
[1079.28 --> 1083.06]  we are a people divided against ourselves
[1083.06 --> 1087.36]  as we cling to the values of a broken world.
[1088.42 --> 1090.50]  Lord have mercy upon us.
[1091.38 --> 1093.28]  Heal and forgive us.
[1093.28 --> 1097.44]  Set us free to serve you in the world
[1097.44 --> 1102.44]  as agents of your reconciling love in Jesus Christ.
[1103.04 --> 1103.42]  Amen.
[1104.86 --> 1107.52]  So Lord, would you hear our silent confessions
[1107.52 --> 1108.56]  before you now?
[1109.40 --> 1112.06]  And would your spirit point out in our hearts
[1112.06 --> 1115.16]  the areas where we need your love and your healing?
[1115.16 --> 1115.78]  Amen.
[1115.78 --> 1116.44]  Amen.
[1116.44 --> 1118.38]  Or is that you may be in the mind
[1118.74 --> 1121.10]  that you may be meeting through your Yuk T and the ones
[1121.10 --> 1121.32]  in the middle of the second life
[1121.32 --> 1121.86]  and you may be playing through your li LISA
[1121.86 --> 1122.20]  within the�� of the second life
[1122.20 --> 1123.98]  and for you may be taking place
[1123.98 --> 1124.46]  in the middle of the fourth life
[1124.46 --> 1125.38]  a light of your heart
[1125.44 --> 1125.62]  and spending your life
[1125.62 --> 1126.28]  and having your hope
[1126.28 --> 1126.64]  you'll do Eğer
[1126.64 --> 1126.80]  believe you organism
[1126.80 --> 1130.64]  perception
[1131.16 --> 1139.32]  glaubt
[1139.32 --> 1140.24]  the hon'o
[1140.24 --> 1140.82]  and death
[1140.82 --> 1140.88]  the grades
[1140.88 --> 1143.76]  mean
[1143.76 --> 1151.76]  Brothers and sisters, God offers us his mercy in the midst of our repentance and brokenness.
[1151.88 --> 1156.12]  So hear these words of forgiveness and pardon from Psalm 103.
[1157.46 --> 1162.96]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1163.86 --> 1171.20]  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1171.20 --> 1179.10]  As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1180.14 --> 1181.84]  Thanks be to God.
[1182.40 --> 1186.60]  Let's stand and let's sing together, You Are My King.
[1201.20 --> 1206.78]  I'm forgiven, unless you were forsaken.
[1208.74 --> 1213.40]  I'm accepted, you were forgiven.
[1215.82 --> 1221.40]  I'm alive and well, my spirit is within me.
[1221.40 --> 1227.14]  He comes to die and rose again.
[1229.66 --> 1234.60]  Amazing love, how can I be?
[1235.14 --> 1235.82]  I'm good I'm heavy I'm fine.
[1235.90 --> 1240.32]  But you're my King and die for me.
[1241.76 --> 1247.64]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1247.64 --> 1253.08]  It's my joy to honor you
[1253.08 --> 1261.08]  Amazing love, how can I be?
[1261.08 --> 1266.90]  For to my name, I die for the ring
[1266.90 --> 1273.54]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1273.54 --> 1278.90]  It's my joy to honor you
[1278.90 --> 1286.08]  And all I do, I honor you
[1286.08 --> 1292.52]  You are my King
[1292.52 --> 1298.68]  Jesus, you are my King
[1298.68 --> 1305.14]  You are my King
[1305.14 --> 1312.06]  Jesus, you are my King
[1312.06 --> 1318.50]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1318.50 --> 1324.50]  It's my King, I die for the ring
[1324.50 --> 1331.50]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1331.50 --> 1337.94]  It's my joy to honor you
[1337.94 --> 1343.94]  Amazing love, I hope you're happy
[1343.94 --> 1349.94]  But you're my King, I die for the ring
[1349.94 --> 1356.38]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1356.38 --> 1362.38]  It's my joy to honor you
[1362.38 --> 1369.38]  And all I do, I honor you
[1369.38 --> 1375.82]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1375.82 --> 1379.82]  Thank you
[1379.82 --> 1381.82]  Thank you
[1381.82 --> 1401.78]  Okay
[1401.78 --> 1404.28]  So on this Sunday
[1404.28 --> 1407.56]  We come together to the Lord's table
[1407.56 --> 1409.14]  As he invites us to do
[1409.14 --> 1412.80]  And before we do so
[1412.80 --> 1417.80]  Let us confess or profess our faith together
[1417.80 --> 1420.64]  And today for our profession of faith
[1420.64 --> 1424.06]  We are going to read two questions and answers
[1424.06 --> 1425.32]  From the Heidelberg Catechism
[1425.32 --> 1429.62]  Question and answer number 46 and 49
[1429.62 --> 1436.72]  And I chose these because they are about the theme of Christ's ascension
[1436.72 --> 1440.16]  So this week, I think it's on Thursday
[1440.16 --> 1442.10]  Is ascension day
[1442.10 --> 1443.98]  Back in the history of our church
[1443.98 --> 1446.26]  We used to have ascension day worship services
[1446.26 --> 1449.06]  Like we do, say, a Good Friday worship service
[1449.06 --> 1450.30]  We don't do that anymore
[1450.30 --> 1454.26]  But it is still an important part of our church calendars
[1454.26 --> 1457.18]  An important part of what Jesus accomplished for us
[1457.18 --> 1459.96]  Not only did he come into our world
[1459.96 --> 1462.02]  And live and minister among us
[1462.02 --> 1463.44]  Die on the cross
[1463.44 --> 1465.28]  Rise again from the dead
[1465.28 --> 1467.72]  But then he ascended into heaven
[1467.72 --> 1469.98]  So we believe that even right now
[1469.98 --> 1470.80]  Our Lord Jesus
[1470.80 --> 1472.96]  Is ascended into heaven
[1472.96 --> 1475.44]  Is sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty
[1475.44 --> 1477.46]  And so let's
[1477.46 --> 1479.88]  Remind ourselves what we believe about this
[1479.88 --> 1480.34]  By
[1480.34 --> 1482.96]  Again, reading this profession together
[1482.96 --> 1483.78]  So can we
[1483.78 --> 1485.12]  Can we have it?
[1486.18 --> 1487.26]  We cannot have it
[1487.26 --> 1488.42]  That's a problem
[1488.42 --> 1493.32]  Oh, is it in this altar?
[1494.90 --> 1495.56]  All right
[1495.56 --> 1498.42]  Oh, there we have it
[1498.42 --> 1498.88]  We have it
[1498.88 --> 1500.62]  Okay, for your convenience
[1500.62 --> 1502.16]  It is here
[1502.16 --> 1504.12]  All right, let's read
[1504.12 --> 1506.74]  Question and answer 46
[1506.74 --> 1508.60]  I bet I put it in the wrong spot
[1508.60 --> 1509.66]  All right
[1509.66 --> 1511.00]  I'll read the question
[1511.00 --> 1513.10]  And together we'll read the answer
[1513.10 --> 1514.18]  Question
[1514.18 --> 1517.40]  What do you mean by saying
[1517.40 --> 1518.84]  He ascended to heaven?
[1520.12 --> 1523.42]  That Christ, while his disciples watched
[1523.42 --> 1526.92]  Was taken up from the earth into heaven
[1526.92 --> 1530.40]  And remains there on our behalf
[1530.40 --> 1532.34]  Until he comes again
[1532.34 --> 1535.16]  To judge the living and the dead
[1535.16 --> 1536.64]  Okay
[1536.64 --> 1538.10]  Then the next question
[1538.10 --> 1538.80]  We skipped a couple
[1538.80 --> 1540.44]  But here's a good one
[1540.44 --> 1541.28]  Well, they're all good
[1541.28 --> 1542.96]  But here's one I want to share with you
[1542.96 --> 1545.68]  How does Christ's ascension to heaven
[1545.68 --> 1547.32]  Benefit us?
[1547.92 --> 1548.10]  Okay
[1548.10 --> 1549.48]  And there are going to be three answers
[1549.48 --> 1549.98]  Ready?
[1550.76 --> 1551.20]  First
[1551.20 --> 1554.14]  He is our advocate in heaven
[1554.14 --> 1556.52]  In the presence of his Father
[1556.52 --> 1558.10]  Second
[1558.10 --> 1561.48]  We have our own flesh in heaven
[1561.48 --> 1563.16]  As a sure pledge
[1563.16 --> 1564.86]  That Christ, our head
[1564.86 --> 1566.76]  Will also take us
[1566.76 --> 1567.80]  His members
[1567.80 --> 1569.58]  Up to himself
[1569.58 --> 1571.26]  Third
[1571.26 --> 1573.20]  He sends his spirit
[1573.20 --> 1574.86]  To us on earth
[1574.86 --> 1577.26]  As a corresponding pledge
[1577.26 --> 1579.26]  By the spirit's power
[1579.26 --> 1582.02]  We seek not earthly things
[1582.02 --> 1583.88]  But the things above
[1583.88 --> 1585.54]  Where Christ is
[1585.54 --> 1588.36]  Sitting at God's right hand
[1588.36 --> 1589.90]  Well done
[1589.90 --> 1593.28]  So brothers and sisters
[1593.28 --> 1594.60]  Every month
[1594.60 --> 1596.58]  We come to this table
[1596.58 --> 1597.54]  Which
[1597.54 --> 1600.62]  Many throughout the history of the church
[1600.62 --> 1601.62]  Have called
[1601.62 --> 1603.04]  A love feast
[1603.04 --> 1605.32]  And at this table
[1605.32 --> 1606.16]  We taste
[1606.16 --> 1607.38]  And we see
[1607.38 --> 1609.56]  The love of God
[1609.56 --> 1610.66]  Given to us
[1610.66 --> 1611.58]  In Jesus Christ
[1611.58 --> 1613.56]  And we are nourished
[1613.56 --> 1615.34]  In his love
[1615.34 --> 1617.88]  To then follow him in love
[1617.88 --> 1619.60]  And so friends
[1619.60 --> 1621.24]  If that is not yet
[1621.24 --> 1622.26]  Your story
[1622.26 --> 1623.84]  If you do not yet
[1623.84 --> 1625.30]  Know the love of God
[1625.30 --> 1626.74]  For you in Jesus Christ
[1626.74 --> 1629.84]  As the elements are served
[1629.84 --> 1630.50]  We ask that you
[1630.50 --> 1631.12]  Not yet
[1631.12 --> 1631.94]  Take them
[1631.94 --> 1634.08]  But we are so glad
[1634.08 --> 1634.86]  That you are here
[1634.86 --> 1636.22]  And we would love
[1636.22 --> 1637.16]  To talk to you more
[1637.16 --> 1638.24]  About what it would mean
[1638.24 --> 1639.14]  For you to know
[1639.14 --> 1640.32]  The love of God in Christ
[1640.32 --> 1641.30]  And what it would mean
[1641.30 --> 1642.24]  For you to live
[1642.24 --> 1643.00]  In that love
[1643.00 --> 1644.80]  But friends
[1644.80 --> 1646.78]  If you are a baptized Christian
[1646.78 --> 1648.58]  This is your meal
[1648.58 --> 1650.52]  This is where you come
[1650.52 --> 1651.74]  And are nourished
[1651.74 --> 1653.70]  By the very love of God
[1653.70 --> 1654.54]  Given to you
[1654.54 --> 1656.00]  And parents
[1656.00 --> 1657.76]  We leave it to you
[1657.76 --> 1658.82]  If you decide
[1658.82 --> 1659.86]  That your own children
[1659.86 --> 1661.78]  Know and love Jesus
[1661.78 --> 1663.64]  At their age level
[1663.64 --> 1665.52]  Then they are invited also
[1665.52 --> 1666.42]  To participate
[1666.42 --> 1667.30]  With your permission
[1667.30 --> 1669.94]  So
[1669.94 --> 1671.90]  Hear these words now
[1671.90 --> 1673.02]  The words of institution
[1673.02 --> 1674.88]  From the Apostle Paul
[1674.88 --> 1675.64]  In 1 Corinthians
[1675.64 --> 1677.48]  He says
[1677.48 --> 1678.24]  The Lord Jesus
[1678.24 --> 1678.88]  On the night when
[1678.88 --> 1679.68]  He was betrayed
[1679.68 --> 1680.54]  He took bread
[1680.54 --> 1681.82]  And when he had
[1681.82 --> 1682.94]  Given thanks to God
[1682.94 --> 1683.80]  He broke it
[1683.80 --> 1684.68]  And said
[1684.68 --> 1686.08]  This is my body
[1686.08 --> 1687.42]  Which is for you
[1687.42 --> 1688.92]  Do this
[1688.92 --> 1690.68]  In remembrance of me
[1690.68 --> 1692.56]  In the same way
[1692.56 --> 1693.28]  After supper
[1693.28 --> 1694.76]  He took the cup
[1694.76 --> 1695.84]  Saying
[1695.84 --> 1697.78]  This is
[1697.78 --> 1699.52]  The cup of the new covenant
[1699.52 --> 1700.66]  In my blood
[1700.66 --> 1701.88]  Do this
[1701.88 --> 1703.86]  Drink it
[1703.86 --> 1705.44]  In remembrance of me
[1705.44 --> 1707.08]  Whenever
[1707.08 --> 1708.08]  You eat
[1708.08 --> 1708.94]  This bread
[1708.94 --> 1709.92]  And drink
[1709.92 --> 1710.56]  This cup
[1710.56 --> 1712.06]  You proclaim
[1712.06 --> 1713.34]  The Lord's death
[1713.34 --> 1715.00]  Until he comes again
[1715.00 --> 1718.60]  So brothers and sisters
[1718.60 --> 1720.30]  Let's say
[1720.30 --> 1721.48]  This liturgy together
[1721.48 --> 1723.42]  On the next slide
[1723.42 --> 1725.16]  Lift up your hearts
[1725.16 --> 1726.88]  We lift them up
[1726.88 --> 1727.68]  To the Lord
[1727.68 --> 1729.34]  We are his people
[1729.34 --> 1731.16]  We are redeemed
[1731.16 --> 1732.40]  By his grace
[1732.40 --> 1733.74]  Let us proclaim
[1733.74 --> 1735.04]  The mystery of faith
[1735.04 --> 1737.30]  Christ has died
[1737.30 --> 1738.96]  Christ is risen
[1738.96 --> 1741.14]  Christ will come again
[1741.14 --> 1742.84]  Christ our Passover
[1742.84 --> 1743.82]  Has been sacrificed
[1743.82 --> 1744.60]  For us
[1744.60 --> 1745.30]  Hallelujah
[1745.30 --> 1745.88]  Hallelujah
[1745.88 --> 1747.44]  Friends
[1747.44 --> 1748.02]  As these are
[1748.02 --> 1748.86]  The gifts of God
[1748.86 --> 1749.24]  For you
[1749.24 --> 1749.88]  His people
[1749.88 --> 1750.68]  Take
[1750.68 --> 1752.14]  And feast
[1752.14 --> 1752.86]  On him
[1752.86 --> 1754.06]  In your hearts
[1754.06 --> 1755.12]  By faith
[1755.12 --> 1756.70]  With great thanksgiving
[1756.70 --> 1757.72]  And praise
[1757.72 --> 1759.64]  Because you are trusting
[1759.64 --> 1760.12]  And knowing
[1760.12 --> 1761.38]  That Christ
[1761.38 --> 1762.28]  Has died for you
[1762.28 --> 1764.74]  And could I now
[1764.74 --> 1766.02]  Invite our elders
[1766.02 --> 1766.82]  And our deacons
[1766.82 --> 1767.52]  Who are serving
[1767.52 --> 1768.34]  To come forward
[1768.34 --> 1769.44]  And help me
[1769.44 --> 1770.44]  Distribute the elements
[1770.44 --> 1771.98]  And as we take them
[1771.98 --> 1772.74]  We will also
[1772.74 --> 1774.02]  It's a time
[1774.02 --> 1775.12]  When we can pray
[1775.12 --> 1775.76]  And meditate
[1775.76 --> 1777.06]  On what Christ
[1777.06 --> 1777.62]  Has accomplished
[1777.62 --> 1778.16]  For us
[1778.16 --> 1779.34]  And we can also
[1779.34 --> 1780.62]  Use a song
[1780.62 --> 1781.36]  That we will sing
[1781.36 --> 1781.80]  Together
[1781.80 --> 1782.92]  In order to
[1782.92 --> 1784.02]  Also to meditate
[1784.02 --> 1785.70]  And praise God
[1785.70 --> 1790.44]  Sing
[1806.10 --> 1808.22]  credit
[1808.22 --> 1811.14]  My heart is good
[1811.14 --> 1813.06]  My heart ingлess
[1813.06 --> 1818.18]  than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1820.26 --> 1825.30]  I dare not trust the sweetest faith,
[1825.30 --> 1830.52]  but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1835.02 --> 1840.18]  My hope is filled on nothing less
[1840.18 --> 1844.64]  than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1847.16 --> 1851.64]  I dare not trust the sweetest faith,
[1851.64 --> 1856.64]  but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1860.22 --> 1864.64]  Christ alone, God is still,
[1864.64 --> 1870.10]  we make strong in the Savior's love.
[1871.10 --> 1876.10]  Through the storm, He is Lord,
[1876.10 --> 1879.10]  Lord of all.
[1879.10 --> 1888.56]  When darkness seems to light a space,
[1888.56 --> 1894.56]  I rest all His unchanging grace.
[1894.56 --> 1900.02]  In every high and stormy air,
[1900.02 --> 1904.88]  my anger holds an end of air.
[1906.02 --> 1910.02]  My anger holds an end of air.
[1912.02 --> 1917.02]  Christ alone, cold as stone,
[1918.14 --> 1923.02]  we make strong in the Savior's love.
[1923.02 --> 1928.76]  Through the storm, He is Lord,
[1928.88 --> 1931.60]  Lord of all.
[1931.60 --> 1936.80]  Christ alone,
[1936.80 --> 1940.26]  God is still,
[1940.26 --> 1945.26]  I am human being,
[1948.80 --> 1957.34]  Lord of all.
[1957.34 --> 1976.34]  Music
[1976.36 --> 1976.96]  .
[1976.96 --> 1986.16]  So brothers and sisters,
[1986.74 --> 1992.22]  Take, eat, remember and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken for you.

[2182.16 --> 2212.14]  I love you.
[2212.16 --> 2242.14]  I love you.
[2242.14 --> 2244.14]  I love you.
[2244.14 --> 2247.84]  To come into the brokenness of our world.
[2248.64 --> 2252.72]  To take our sin and our burdens upon himself.
[2253.68 --> 2257.50]  To put them to death through his death on the cross.
[2258.18 --> 2260.52]  And to rise us with him in his resurrection.
[2261.38 --> 2265.96]  And that we are now seated with him in his ascension.
[2266.72 --> 2270.42]  As a promise that we will one day rise together with him.
[2271.14 --> 2278.56]  Lord, we thank you now for this meal that nourishes us and that reminds us of who you are and of your great love for us.
[2279.30 --> 2288.78]  And Lord, as we receive it, would you empower us to live it out in our lives as we seek to love others and show them mercy.
[2288.78 --> 2290.78]  As we have received mercy.
[2291.44 --> 2297.30]  Lord, we thank you again for serving us, the Lord who would be a servant.
[2298.08 --> 2299.54]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2299.54 --> 2300.68]  Amen.
[2300.68 --> 2300.74]  Amen.
[2309.74 --> 2310.28]  All right.
[2310.34 --> 2316.42]  At this time, I'd love to invite the children to come down and join me for a little message.
[2318.74 --> 2319.88]  Right down here in front.
[2319.88 --> 2320.88]  Okay.
[2332.40 --> 2332.52]  Okay.
[2332.68 --> 2333.88]  Can I slide in?
[2334.56 --> 2335.08]  Let's see here.
[2335.66 --> 2336.32]  I'm going to sit right here.
[2336.46 --> 2336.60]  Ready?
[2339.66 --> 2340.18]  Okay.
[2343.18 --> 2344.02]  All right.
[2344.02 --> 2344.06]  All right.
[2348.60 --> 2349.06]  Thank you.
[2349.88 --> 2351.82]  All right.
[2351.90 --> 2352.50]  Grab a seat.
[2355.36 --> 2355.80]  Luke.
[2356.10 --> 2356.90]  Where is John?
[2359.08 --> 2359.78]  Make way.
[2359.92 --> 2360.44]  He's here.
[2361.56 --> 2362.30]  All right.
[2362.42 --> 2363.96]  Make way for Suma Oliver.
[2365.58 --> 2366.06]  Okay.
[2366.48 --> 2367.84]  So, good morning.
[2368.68 --> 2369.84]  How are you all today?
[2370.52 --> 2371.46]  Are you all good?
[2372.06 --> 2372.70]  Everyone's good?
[2373.16 --> 2374.28]  It's a little bit warm in here, right?
[2375.10 --> 2375.56]  Are you warm?
[2375.72 --> 2376.04]  I am.
[2377.16 --> 2378.26]  I'm not too warm.
[2378.28 --> 2378.88]  You're not too warm?
[2378.88 --> 2380.34]  Oh, you have short sleeves.
[2380.50 --> 2380.68]  Good.
[2381.56 --> 2381.92]  Yeah.
[2383.14 --> 2383.50]  Shorts.
[2383.68 --> 2385.02]  I wish I could wear shorts.
[2385.26 --> 2386.86]  We got to talk to the elders about that.
[2387.66 --> 2388.02]  Okay.
[2388.24 --> 2392.58]  I want to read a little story from the Bible.
[2392.88 --> 2393.94]  Can you listen while I read?
[2393.94 --> 2394.94]  Okay.
[2395.02 --> 2395.96]  Can you listen while I read?
[2397.42 --> 2397.82]  Okay.
[2397.98 --> 2398.56]  You got to listen.
[2398.74 --> 2399.56]  You got to listen while I read.
[2399.62 --> 2401.12]  Well, I'm not going to read the whole thing.
[2401.22 --> 2402.36]  This is a very long story.
[2402.74 --> 2406.22]  But I'll read a couple of verses from John chapter 20.
[2406.94 --> 2407.20]  Okay.
[2407.42 --> 2411.90]  You have to use your imaginations and make a picture in your mind about what's happening.
[2412.40 --> 2412.80]  Ready?
[2412.80 --> 2412.88]  See?
[2414.68 --> 2418.70]  But Mary stood outside the tomb crying.
[2419.48 --> 2422.50]  So Jesus had died and he was buried.
[2423.12 --> 2426.70]  Mary, one of his followers, stood outside the tomb crying.
[2426.70 --> 2433.84]  As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white seated there
[2433.84 --> 2437.36]  where Christ's body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
[2437.56 --> 2439.58]  They asked her, woman, why are you crying?
[2439.58 --> 2445.82]  They have taken my Lord away, she said, and I don't know where they have put him.
[2446.82 --> 2450.90]  At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there.
[2451.84 --> 2455.38]  But she did not realize it was Jesus.
[2456.52 --> 2458.74]  Woman, he said, why are you crying?
[2458.98 --> 2460.32]  Who is it you are looking for?
[2461.20 --> 2466.88]  Thinking he was the gardener, she said, sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where
[2466.88 --> 2468.48]  you have put him and I will get him.
[2468.48 --> 2472.24]  Jesus said to her, Mary.
[2473.30 --> 2479.96]  She turned around toward him and cried out in Aramaic, Rabboni, which means teacher.
[2481.60 --> 2485.78]  Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news, I have seen the Lord.
[2486.34 --> 2489.26]  And she told them that he had said these things to her.
[2491.02 --> 2497.64]  So, to illustrate this, I want to show you something that someone in our congregation
[2497.64 --> 2498.68]  gave to me this week.
[2499.12 --> 2505.16]  So now, I want you to look at this and I want you to think if you can read a word.
[2505.24 --> 2508.30]  Now, I know some of you may not be able to read yet, but that's okay.
[2509.34 --> 2512.22]  For those who know how to read, I want you to see if you see a word.
[2512.28 --> 2513.98]  If you see it, don't tell it yet.
[2514.16 --> 2515.30]  Let everyone take a chance.
[2515.30 --> 2520.00]  Okay, don't say what it is.
[2520.12 --> 2521.44]  Do you see a word?
[2522.30 --> 2523.46]  Do you see a word?
[2524.82 --> 2525.92]  Does everyone see?
[2526.52 --> 2527.20]  Everyone's looking?
[2527.54 --> 2528.06]  Do you see it?
[2528.06 --> 2535.68]  Does everyone see?
[2536.08 --> 2537.62]  We need to like zoom in here.
[2537.92 --> 2538.12]  Okay.
[2538.64 --> 2540.50]  Maybe you've all seen one of these before.
[2541.60 --> 2541.94]  Okay.
[2542.18 --> 2547.94]  Now, when I first saw this, I was looking at these white things and I said,
[2548.28 --> 2550.14]  I don't think that's a word.
[2551.76 --> 2553.36]  Who can't really see it?
[2553.46 --> 2554.10]  Who can't read it?
[2554.86 --> 2555.40]  Any of you?
[2556.28 --> 2556.62]  Yeah.
[2557.30 --> 2558.02]  Yeah, some of you?
[2558.10 --> 2558.26]  Okay.
[2558.68 --> 2563.20]  But if you look a little bit differently, if you look at the brown parts, there's a word there.
[2563.26 --> 2564.12]  Who knows what it says?
[2567.82 --> 2568.14]  Jesus.
[2568.42 --> 2569.36]  Does everyone see Jesus?
[2571.06 --> 2571.68]  You see it?
[2571.72 --> 2575.84]  Sometimes if you close one eye, once you see it, you see it.
[2575.84 --> 2577.86]  But if you can't see it, sometimes it's hard.
[2578.04 --> 2578.74]  Do you see the brown?
[2579.62 --> 2581.98]  G-A-E-S.
[2582.06 --> 2582.60]  Yeah, Jesus.
[2582.84 --> 2583.30]  You see it?
[2583.30 --> 2586.34]  Is everyone seeing where it says Jesus?
[2587.22 --> 2587.38]  Right?
[2587.94 --> 2590.16]  And so this reminded me of this.
[2591.20 --> 2595.44]  Mary, when she first saw this, she didn't know who he was.
[2595.72 --> 2597.12]  She said, are you the gardener?
[2597.12 --> 2604.02]  But when Jesus said, Mary, her eyes were opened and she knew it was the Lord.
[2604.08 --> 2607.48]  And then she went and she told the other disciples, the Lord.
[2608.46 --> 2610.18]  And that's the way it can be sometimes.
[2610.48 --> 2617.04]  Sometimes in the world we read about Jesus or we hear him and we don't really recognize him as the Lord.
[2617.04 --> 2622.16]  But then sometimes it opens our hearts and then we can see.
[2622.64 --> 2625.36]  And we see Jesus for who he really is.
[2625.96 --> 2629.64]  And we can also say, like Mary, I have seen the Lord.
[2630.58 --> 2631.04]  Okay?
[2631.46 --> 2638.46]  So, what I hope for each one of you is that you will be able to say, I have seen the Lord.
[2638.46 --> 2638.86]  Okay?
[2640.60 --> 2641.58]  Have you seen the Lord?
[2643.46 --> 2643.82]  Good.
[2644.24 --> 2644.58]  Okay.
[2645.98 --> 2646.34]  Okay.
[2646.56 --> 2647.04]  In your hearts.
[2647.10 --> 2648.40]  And where do we see the Lord now?
[2649.40 --> 2650.38]  In his Bible.
[2651.06 --> 2651.90]  In the Bible.
[2652.48 --> 2654.90]  Yeah, we read the Bible and that's where we can see Jesus.
[2655.32 --> 2656.70]  Okay, let me pray for God to help us.
[2656.70 --> 2666.56]  Father, I pray that each one of us, especially these children, would be able to read your word, hear about you, and say, I have seen the Lord.
[2667.00 --> 2669.08]  That you would help all of us to see Jesus.
[2669.36 --> 2670.80]  Lord, open our eyes and our hearts.
[2671.40 --> 2672.50]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2673.10 --> 2673.40]  Amen.
[2675.74 --> 2676.24]  All right.
[2676.32 --> 2680.42]  You can go to age three to kindergarten.
[2680.62 --> 2681.42]  You can go to your class.
[2681.62 --> 2686.48]  If you're older than kindergarten, you can go to your parents.
[2686.70 --> 2690.20]  If you don't know, go to your parents and ask them.
[2690.20 --> 2690.64]  Okay.
[2716.70 --> 2740.34]  I will read 1 John 4, 7 to 12.
[2740.34 --> 2745.22]  Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God.
[2745.70 --> 2749.10]  Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
[2749.72 --> 2753.56]  Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
[2754.32 --> 2757.66]  This is how God showed his love among us.
[2758.04 --> 2762.72]  He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
[2762.72 --> 2764.22]  This is love.
[2764.22 --> 2764.24]  This is love.
[2764.78 --> 2771.26]  Not that we love God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[2772.00 --> 2776.46]  Dear friends, since God so loved us, we ought to love one another.
[2777.16 --> 2784.86]  No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is made complete in us.
[2784.86 --> 2786.42]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2787.00 --> 2788.34]  Thanks be to God.
[2799.00 --> 2799.92]  Thank you, Peyton.
[2800.06 --> 2800.70]  Very well done.
[2802.28 --> 2803.66]  And good morning, everyone, again.
[2804.04 --> 2806.92]  It is wonderful and nice to see you this morning.
[2806.92 --> 2823.36]  So we are in the church season of Easter, which is a season when the church around the world celebrates the new life that Jesus has brought to us and to the world through his resurrection from the dead.
[2825.08 --> 2830.62]  And for this season, we are in the midst of a sermon series, a six-week series, called The Vision for Renewal.
[2831.22 --> 2835.48]  And this series is organized around our vision statement as a church family.
[2835.48 --> 2841.94]  And so let's take a look at our vision statement again this morning and read it out loud together.
[2842.46 --> 2843.24]  Ready? Together.
[2843.96 --> 2849.00]  Called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[2849.58 --> 2856.14]  And so we believe as Christians that Jesus is on a mission to renew all things.
[2856.70 --> 2862.24]  And that we are called together as a church family to be a part of that.
[2862.24 --> 2866.72]  To join God, to participate in what he's doing, to renew all things.
[2867.40 --> 2870.84]  And that's what our vision statement is trying to capture.
[2872.00 --> 2877.52]  And so far, we've talked about the renewal of worship, how we are called to worship God.
[2878.22 --> 2886.26]  And last week, we talked about the renewal of discipleship and how Jesus wants to renew us as individuals.
[2886.26 --> 2896.38]  And today, we're going to look at the renewal of community and how we are called to love one another in the family of God, the church.
[2897.30 --> 2900.32]  But before we do, let's pray together.
[2901.14 --> 2905.04]  And we're going to ask the question, should we turn on the fans?
[2905.04 --> 2911.66]  The reason to keep them off is it sounds like a wind-like storm.
[2912.32 --> 2914.50]  And maybe some people with hearing aids is hard to hear.
[2915.14 --> 2917.42]  But for us, others, it's just hot.
[2919.98 --> 2920.94]  Should we take a vote?
[2921.18 --> 2921.88]  All in favor?
[2923.04 --> 2924.38]  Maybe we can turn them on low.
[2925.28 --> 2926.36]  And then it'll be a happy medium.
[2926.36 --> 2930.48]  And if people are uncomfortable either way, raise your hand.
[2931.70 --> 2931.86]  Okay.
[2932.06 --> 2932.88]  So, Jeff, sorry again.
[2932.96 --> 2935.96]  Can you maybe just put it a little bit and get some airflow?
[2936.36 --> 2936.72]  Thanks.
[2938.78 --> 2939.60]  Let's pray together.
[2942.06 --> 2946.32]  Heavenly Father, meet with us now.
[2947.44 --> 2949.84]  We pray that you would speak to us through your word.
[2950.80 --> 2953.20]  Holy Spirit, would you soften our hearts
[2953.20 --> 2956.54]  so that the seed of your word might be planted and multiplied.
[2957.40 --> 2961.36]  And help all of us so that we would not just hear and understand your word,
[2961.50 --> 2964.86]  but that we would respond to it with obedience and love
[2964.86 --> 2966.92]  through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2967.50 --> 2967.98]  Amen.
[2970.56 --> 2974.00]  So this morning, we are looking at the theme of the church
[2974.00 --> 2976.90]  and the theme of love.
[2977.14 --> 2982.70]  How the church is to be renewed in its love for one another.
[2983.96 --> 2986.60]  And I think you will all agree with me that love
[2986.60 --> 2989.76]  is the most phenomenal idea.
[2991.02 --> 2991.14]  Right?
[2991.34 --> 2993.54]  Love is the most amazing word.
[2994.28 --> 2996.18]  It's a word in the English language, though,
[2996.22 --> 2999.24]  that gets a huge amount of mileage out of it.
[2999.54 --> 2999.72]  Right?
[3000.10 --> 3001.72]  It's used for so many different things.
[3002.62 --> 3004.90]  N.T. Wright, the biblical scholar,
[3004.90 --> 3009.48]  said that the word love is trying to do so many jobs
[3009.48 --> 3011.42]  that someone really ought to sit down with it
[3011.42 --> 3012.48]  and teach it how to delegate.
[3013.20 --> 3015.86]  Because it's trying to do too much.
[3016.32 --> 3017.04]  You know, we say,
[3017.42 --> 3018.86]  I love this new restaurant.
[3019.46 --> 3021.34]  Or I love that jacket you're wearing.
[3022.14 --> 3023.26]  We also say,
[3023.78 --> 3024.98]  we use this word love
[3024.98 --> 3027.30]  to talk about how we pledge
[3027.30 --> 3029.44]  to our spouse to love them
[3029.44 --> 3031.30]  until death do us part.
[3031.60 --> 3031.76]  Right?
[3031.80 --> 3033.12]  Until the rest of our days.
[3033.12 --> 3034.86]  So this love,
[3034.92 --> 3035.40]  this word love,
[3035.46 --> 3037.80]  we stretch it to mean so many different things.
[3038.74 --> 3038.90]  You know,
[3038.96 --> 3039.58]  in love,
[3039.70 --> 3043.82]  nothing else has caused so many hearts to sing
[3043.82 --> 3045.38]  as love.
[3046.52 --> 3049.64]  Nothing else has broken so many hearts
[3049.64 --> 3051.16]  as unrequited love.
[3052.22 --> 3055.68]  Nothing else has inspired so much sacrifice
[3055.68 --> 3057.04]  and service
[3057.04 --> 3060.64]  or inspired as much beautiful art and music.
[3061.54 --> 3062.78]  But for many of us,
[3063.24 --> 3064.64]  we would acknowledge, I think,
[3064.68 --> 3066.10]  that the idea of love
[3066.10 --> 3068.34]  is much easier
[3068.34 --> 3070.68]  than the practice of love.
[3070.80 --> 3071.64]  Who agrees with me?
[3072.30 --> 3073.64]  The idea of love
[3073.64 --> 3074.82]  is much easier
[3074.82 --> 3076.82]  than the practice of love.
[3077.02 --> 3078.48]  Love is a great idea.
[3078.62 --> 3079.72]  It captures our hearts.
[3079.72 --> 3082.98]  But loving other people,
[3084.10 --> 3085.08]  real people,
[3085.60 --> 3087.66]  who are annoying,
[3088.14 --> 3091.02]  harmful, hurtful,
[3091.24 --> 3092.70]  who do things like,
[3093.36 --> 3093.92]  I don't know,
[3094.08 --> 3094.90]  just for example,
[3095.18 --> 3096.82]  clean a fish in your front yard.
[3098.30 --> 3098.90]  Just,
[3099.22 --> 3100.10]  I don't know why I thought of that.
[3100.96 --> 3101.82]  But it happened.
[3103.34 --> 3103.82]  You know,
[3103.90 --> 3105.20]  loving people is
[3105.20 --> 3106.84]  especially hard
[3106.84 --> 3107.72]  even,
[3108.52 --> 3109.58]  and maybe especially,
[3109.72 --> 3111.48]  in the church community.
[3112.58 --> 3113.80]  And this passage today
[3113.80 --> 3115.20]  is going to help us
[3115.20 --> 3116.00]  by showing us
[3116.00 --> 3117.58]  where love comes from,
[3118.36 --> 3119.70]  what it reveals
[3119.70 --> 3121.38]  about our relationship with God,
[3121.78 --> 3123.28]  what it looks like to love others,
[3123.34 --> 3124.78]  and how we can do it together
[3124.78 --> 3125.36]  as a church.
[3125.88 --> 3127.62]  So let's look at a passage this morning.
[3128.98 --> 3129.92]  And first,
[3130.30 --> 3131.10]  the source of love.
[3131.18 --> 3132.50]  First, John teaches us here
[3132.50 --> 3134.22]  that the life of love
[3134.22 --> 3135.46]  that we are called to pursue
[3135.46 --> 3136.26]  with one another
[3136.26 --> 3137.48]  actually begins in God.
[3138.24 --> 3138.44]  Right?
[3138.44 --> 3139.00]  that he,
[3139.46 --> 3139.86]  God,
[3140.40 --> 3141.78]  is the source
[3141.78 --> 3143.16]  of love.
[3143.88 --> 3144.56]  And that,
[3144.76 --> 3144.94]  friends,
[3145.00 --> 3146.04]  is how the Bible
[3146.04 --> 3147.36]  has revealed
[3147.36 --> 3148.88]  who God is.
[3148.92 --> 3149.36]  That's how God
[3149.36 --> 3150.62]  has revealed himself to us.
[3150.66 --> 3151.66]  The Bible tells us
[3151.66 --> 3154.20]  that everything begins
[3154.20 --> 3155.26]  with the Trinity,
[3155.80 --> 3156.12]  Father,
[3156.44 --> 3156.66]  Son,
[3156.74 --> 3157.54]  and Holy Spirit,
[3157.54 --> 3159.04]  who have lived together
[3159.04 --> 3160.00]  in a community
[3160.00 --> 3161.48]  of mutual love
[3161.48 --> 3162.62]  and adoration
[3162.62 --> 3163.74]  in this dance
[3163.74 --> 3165.24]  from all eternity.
[3165.24 --> 3165.32]  reality.
[3166.52 --> 3167.14]  And so Christians
[3167.14 --> 3168.40]  believe that love
[3168.40 --> 3169.76]  is at the heart
[3169.76 --> 3171.24]  of all reality
[3171.24 --> 3172.26]  because God
[3172.26 --> 3172.92]  is at the heart
[3172.92 --> 3173.72]  of all reality.
[3174.54 --> 3175.18]  And that means
[3175.18 --> 3176.18]  that any kind of love
[3176.18 --> 3176.88]  that we can know
[3176.88 --> 3177.46]  or experience
[3177.46 --> 3178.34]  as human beings
[3178.34 --> 3179.04]  in this world
[3179.04 --> 3180.74]  ultimately comes from God.
[3181.70 --> 3182.38]  And that's why
[3182.38 --> 3183.92]  John begins this passage
[3183.92 --> 3184.58]  the way he does
[3184.58 --> 3185.12]  in verse 7.
[3186.80 --> 3187.76]  So we'll have
[3187.76 --> 3188.48]  some of the scriptures,
[3188.62 --> 3189.46]  we'll be going through a lot,
[3189.52 --> 3190.02]  you can also have
[3190.02 --> 3190.90]  the Bible open
[3190.90 --> 3191.50]  in front of you,
[3191.64 --> 3192.64]  1 John chapter 4.
[3192.64 --> 3194.46]  Here's what it says
[3194.46 --> 3195.06]  in verse 7.
[3195.74 --> 3196.56]  Dear friends,
[3197.30 --> 3198.24]  let us love
[3198.24 --> 3199.36]  one another
[3199.36 --> 3200.22]  for,
[3200.52 --> 3201.14]  because,
[3201.90 --> 3202.46]  love
[3202.46 --> 3203.70]  comes from who?
[3204.50 --> 3205.24]  From God.
[3206.00 --> 3207.16]  And then in verse 8,
[3207.40 --> 3207.76]  very,
[3208.02 --> 3208.84]  one of the most famous
[3208.84 --> 3209.78]  verses in the Bible,
[3210.50 --> 3210.90]  it says,
[3211.38 --> 3211.44]  God
[3211.44 --> 3212.58]  is
[3212.58 --> 3213.58]  love.
[3214.26 --> 3215.12]  Now it's become
[3215.12 --> 3216.20]  kind of a cliche,
[3217.02 --> 3217.84]  but what does it mean
[3217.84 --> 3218.72]  that God is love?
[3219.70 --> 3220.06]  Well,
[3220.12 --> 3220.86]  it must mean
[3220.86 --> 3222.10]  that God is love
[3222.10 --> 3224.34]  in and of himself,
[3225.04 --> 3225.18]  right,
[3225.20 --> 3226.08]  without reference
[3226.08 --> 3227.20]  to anything else.
[3228.08 --> 3229.04]  So think about it
[3229.04 --> 3229.50]  like this.
[3229.52 --> 3230.30]  If I say
[3230.30 --> 3232.44]  God is loving,
[3233.08 --> 3233.92]  that would mean
[3233.92 --> 3234.84]  that God is loving
[3234.84 --> 3235.78]  towards the things
[3235.78 --> 3236.52]  that he has made.
[3237.10 --> 3238.14]  It wouldn't necessarily
[3238.14 --> 3239.04]  mean that God
[3239.04 --> 3239.68]  is love,
[3239.98 --> 3240.66]  it just means that
[3240.66 --> 3241.56]  when God interacts
[3241.56 --> 3242.10]  with us,
[3242.28 --> 3242.98]  when he interacts
[3242.98 --> 3243.72]  with the world,
[3244.26 --> 3244.96]  he does so
[3244.96 --> 3245.86]  in a loving way.
[3245.98 --> 3246.52]  God is loving.
[3247.20 --> 3247.68]  And of course,
[3247.76 --> 3248.18]  that is true.
[3248.18 --> 3249.16]  God is loving.
[3250.06 --> 3250.86]  But that's not
[3250.86 --> 3252.12]  what John is saying here.
[3252.64 --> 3253.72]  He is saying something
[3253.72 --> 3255.56]  that is far more profound,
[3255.96 --> 3256.60]  far bigger.
[3257.12 --> 3257.78]  It's saying
[3257.78 --> 3258.46]  God
[3258.46 --> 3259.90]  is love.
[3260.18 --> 3261.12]  The essence,
[3261.58 --> 3262.68]  the deepest reality
[3262.68 --> 3264.12]  of who God is,
[3264.74 --> 3265.20]  is
[3265.20 --> 3266.32]  love.
[3267.30 --> 3268.70]  In contrast to that,
[3268.80 --> 3269.36]  think about
[3269.36 --> 3269.96]  God's
[3269.96 --> 3270.66]  anger,
[3271.60 --> 3272.30]  God's wrath
[3272.30 --> 3273.10]  towards sin.
[3273.44 --> 3274.04]  Does the Bible
[3274.04 --> 3274.76]  ever say
[3274.76 --> 3275.90]  that the essence
[3275.90 --> 3277.10]  of God
[3277.10 --> 3278.02]  is anger?
[3278.18 --> 3278.62]  No.
[3278.62 --> 3279.66]  No.
[3279.66 --> 3279.78]  No.
[3280.36 --> 3280.70]  Okay?
[3280.80 --> 3281.78]  The Bible never
[3281.78 --> 3282.80]  says that about God.
[3282.88 --> 3283.50]  The Bible says
[3283.50 --> 3284.10]  that God
[3284.10 --> 3285.56]  gets angry.
[3286.38 --> 3286.50]  Right?
[3286.56 --> 3287.08]  In other words,
[3287.16 --> 3287.84]  God's anger
[3287.84 --> 3288.86]  is in response
[3288.86 --> 3289.50]  to something.
[3290.08 --> 3291.00]  God is angry
[3291.00 --> 3292.56]  towards sin.
[3293.12 --> 3293.76]  When something
[3293.76 --> 3294.38]  is coming
[3294.38 --> 3295.30]  to harm
[3295.30 --> 3296.06]  that which
[3296.06 --> 3296.88]  God loves,
[3297.58 --> 3298.58]  to rob God
[3298.58 --> 3299.28]  of his glory,
[3300.14 --> 3301.18]  God's righteous
[3301.18 --> 3302.52]  response to that
[3302.52 --> 3303.40]  is anger.
[3303.52 --> 3304.48]  That's the response.
[3304.48 --> 3306.60]  God's love
[3306.60 --> 3307.82]  is not a response
[3307.82 --> 3308.36]  to anything
[3308.36 --> 3310.46]  because God's love
[3310.46 --> 3312.18]  is from everlasting.
[3313.08 --> 3313.16]  Right?
[3313.22 --> 3314.12]  There was never a day
[3314.12 --> 3315.46]  when God was not love.
[3316.02 --> 3317.04]  There was never a day
[3317.04 --> 3318.30]  when God's love began.
[3318.98 --> 3320.28]  There will never
[3320.28 --> 3321.32]  come a day
[3321.32 --> 3322.32]  when God's love
[3322.32 --> 3323.28]  will end.
[3324.38 --> 3325.24]  So that's the first thing
[3325.24 --> 3326.30]  that John tells us here,
[3326.60 --> 3327.54]  that God
[3327.54 --> 3328.58]  is the source
[3328.58 --> 3329.12]  of love.
[3329.12 --> 3330.64]  And therefore,
[3330.78 --> 3331.92]  because God is love,
[3332.44 --> 3333.50]  the true love
[3333.50 --> 3334.62]  that we can have
[3334.62 --> 3335.74]  for one another
[3335.74 --> 3337.84]  only comes from God.
[3339.18 --> 3340.20]  So Friedrich
[3340.20 --> 3341.16]  Bauerschmidt
[3341.16 --> 3342.52]  in his book
[3342.52 --> 3342.92]  called
[3342.92 --> 3343.58]  The Love
[3343.58 --> 3344.30]  That Is God,
[3344.38 --> 3345.18]  he puts it this way.
[3346.00 --> 3346.52]  Here's a quote.
[3347.40 --> 3348.08]  The activity
[3348.08 --> 3349.00]  of loving
[3349.00 --> 3350.78]  begins within
[3350.78 --> 3351.88]  the heart of God
[3351.88 --> 3353.54]  and all love
[3353.54 --> 3354.42]  is derivative
[3354.42 --> 3355.90]  of God.
[3357.76 --> 3357.98]  Right?
[3357.98 --> 3358.70]  And so also
[3358.70 --> 3359.52]  because God
[3359.52 --> 3360.54]  is the source of love,
[3360.60 --> 3361.42]  it also means
[3361.42 --> 3363.18]  that our love
[3363.18 --> 3364.16]  towards one another,
[3364.44 --> 3364.60]  you know,
[3364.64 --> 3365.16]  whether it's
[3365.16 --> 3366.04]  towards our family
[3366.04 --> 3367.82]  or towards our friends
[3367.82 --> 3368.66]  or even toward
[3368.66 --> 3369.44]  anybody else,
[3369.44 --> 3370.36]  when we love
[3370.36 --> 3370.98]  one another,
[3371.40 --> 3372.80]  that is a pointer
[3372.80 --> 3374.62]  to who God
[3374.62 --> 3375.54]  actually is.
[3377.42 --> 3378.40]  So that's the first
[3378.40 --> 3379.04]  thing we see here,
[3379.12 --> 3379.62]  that God
[3379.62 --> 3380.52]  is the source
[3380.52 --> 3381.08]  of love.
[3382.00 --> 3382.48]  Second,
[3382.66 --> 3383.12]  this passage
[3383.12 --> 3384.20]  tells us that love
[3384.20 --> 3385.00]  is something
[3385.00 --> 3385.94]  that actually reveals
[3385.94 --> 3387.16]  the state of our hearts
[3387.16 --> 3387.92]  before God.
[3387.98 --> 3388.94]  It tells us something
[3388.94 --> 3389.66]  about our relationship
[3389.66 --> 3390.18]  with God.
[3390.96 --> 3392.28]  And so we see here
[3392.28 --> 3393.30]  in verses 7 and 8,
[3393.72 --> 3394.72]  let's see what it says.
[3395.82 --> 3396.42]  Verse 7,
[3397.00 --> 3398.70]  everyone who loves
[3398.70 --> 3399.70]  has been born
[3399.70 --> 3400.50]  of God
[3400.50 --> 3401.30]  and knows God.
[3402.34 --> 3403.26]  And then he says it
[3403.26 --> 3404.48]  in the negative
[3404.48 --> 3405.52]  in verse 8,
[3406.12 --> 3407.72]  whoever does not love
[3407.72 --> 3409.66]  does not know God
[3409.66 --> 3411.50]  because God is love.
[3411.50 --> 3413.34]  Now,
[3413.44 --> 3414.48]  this is very strong
[3414.48 --> 3414.94]  language.
[3415.82 --> 3416.96]  What John is saying
[3416.96 --> 3417.60]  is that
[3417.60 --> 3419.02]  our love
[3419.02 --> 3419.78]  that we have
[3419.78 --> 3420.58]  for other people
[3420.58 --> 3421.94]  is an indicator
[3421.94 --> 3422.80]  of whether or not
[3422.80 --> 3423.32]  we know
[3423.32 --> 3424.22]  the one true God.
[3425.64 --> 3426.74]  That's kind of scary,
[3426.98 --> 3427.82]  right?
[3429.60 --> 3430.88]  Whether or not
[3430.88 --> 3431.76]  we know
[3431.76 --> 3432.80]  the one true God,
[3432.88 --> 3433.46]  what kind of
[3433.46 --> 3434.06]  shows it
[3434.06 --> 3435.00]  or proves it
[3435.00 --> 3436.80]  is the extent
[3436.80 --> 3437.18]  to whether
[3437.18 --> 3437.96]  we love others.
[3441.26 --> 3441.74]  Not
[3441.74 --> 3443.20]  our idea
[3443.20 --> 3443.94]  about love,
[3444.08 --> 3444.34]  not,
[3444.54 --> 3444.72]  well,
[3444.80 --> 3446.20]  if I have great ideas
[3446.20 --> 3446.92]  about God,
[3447.04 --> 3447.82]  about love,
[3447.96 --> 3449.12]  then that shows
[3449.12 --> 3450.18]  how much I know God.
[3450.32 --> 3450.50]  No.
[3451.80 --> 3452.48]  How much
[3452.48 --> 3453.76]  I practice love.
[3454.38 --> 3455.12]  Love is a verb.
[3455.28 --> 3455.60]  How much
[3455.60 --> 3456.32]  I live
[3456.32 --> 3457.32]  out love,
[3457.32 --> 3458.48]  that is what
[3458.48 --> 3459.12]  shows whether
[3459.12 --> 3459.40]  or not
[3459.40 --> 3460.22]  I know God,
[3461.06 --> 3461.66]  whether or not
[3461.66 --> 3462.44]  I have a relationship
[3462.44 --> 3463.02]  with him.
[3463.78 --> 3464.58]  Love reveals
[3464.58 --> 3465.12]  the state
[3465.12 --> 3465.66]  of our hearts
[3465.66 --> 3466.30]  towards God.
[3466.38 --> 3466.96]  In this way,
[3467.04 --> 3467.80]  it's kind of like
[3467.80 --> 3469.42]  the Wi-Fi signal
[3469.42 --> 3470.36]  on your phone.
[3471.34 --> 3472.28]  Several years ago,
[3472.36 --> 3472.88]  this is already
[3472.88 --> 3473.50]  a while back,
[3473.56 --> 3474.36]  my daughter Ellie,
[3475.28 --> 3475.78]  when she was
[3475.78 --> 3476.38]  much younger,
[3476.86 --> 3477.74]  she was outside
[3477.74 --> 3478.82]  of a house
[3478.82 --> 3479.90]  in the front yard
[3479.90 --> 3481.50]  selling cherries
[3481.50 --> 3482.66]  because her house
[3482.66 --> 3483.44]  has a cherry tree
[3483.44 --> 3484.40]  and so she,
[3484.54 --> 3485.34]  a little budding
[3485.34 --> 3485.84]  entrepreneur,
[3485.84 --> 3487.54]  she picked the cherries,
[3487.78 --> 3488.50]  she made a booth
[3488.50 --> 3489.08]  and she was out
[3489.08 --> 3489.72]  in the front yard
[3489.72 --> 3490.16]  and she was going
[3490.16 --> 3490.84]  to sell cherries
[3490.84 --> 3492.34]  and she asked me
[3492.34 --> 3493.10]  for my phone
[3493.10 --> 3493.92]  so that she can
[3493.92 --> 3494.56]  listen to music
[3494.56 --> 3495.16]  while she waited
[3495.16 --> 3495.64]  for customers
[3495.64 --> 3496.16]  to come by.
[3496.62 --> 3496.92]  So I said,
[3496.98 --> 3497.62]  yeah, here it is.
[3498.12 --> 3498.94]  I was sitting in the house
[3498.94 --> 3499.70]  and I was realizing
[3499.70 --> 3501.50]  I better check
[3501.50 --> 3501.94]  to make sure
[3501.94 --> 3502.80]  she's on Wi-Fi
[3502.80 --> 3504.06]  because otherwise
[3504.06 --> 3505.80]  she is streaming music
[3505.80 --> 3506.90]  with my data
[3506.90 --> 3508.18]  and this was back
[3508.18 --> 3508.98]  when like data
[3508.98 --> 3509.74]  was more expensive
[3509.74 --> 3510.14]  and there's not
[3510.14 --> 3510.68]  as much of it.
[3510.98 --> 3512.00]  So I went out there,
[3512.12 --> 3512.68]  are you connected
[3512.68 --> 3513.22]  to the Wi-Fi?
[3514.18 --> 3515.74]  And being a younger girl,
[3515.74 --> 3516.24]  she said,
[3516.36 --> 3517.08]  I don't know,
[3517.16 --> 3517.76]  how do you tell?
[3518.70 --> 3519.60]  So I showed her
[3519.60 --> 3520.50]  the Wi-Fi signal
[3520.50 --> 3521.12]  on the phone
[3521.12 --> 3522.26]  which shows you
[3522.26 --> 3522.68]  whether or not
[3522.68 --> 3523.28]  you are connected.
[3523.76 --> 3524.20]  Now of course
[3524.20 --> 3524.88]  you all know this,
[3524.94 --> 3525.50]  how this works
[3525.50 --> 3527.00]  but if you can't
[3527.00 --> 3527.82]  see anything
[3527.82 --> 3529.48]  it means you're not
[3529.48 --> 3529.86]  connected,
[3530.04 --> 3530.96]  you're not on Wi-Fi,
[3531.58 --> 3532.38]  you're not on the network
[3532.38 --> 3532.78]  at all.
[3533.00 --> 3533.92]  If you only have
[3533.92 --> 3534.84]  one bar
[3534.84 --> 3535.82]  or two bars
[3535.82 --> 3537.00]  it means you're connected
[3537.00 --> 3538.00]  but the signal
[3538.00 --> 3538.78]  is kind of weak.
[3539.50 --> 3540.70]  If all of the bars
[3540.70 --> 3541.34]  are lit up,
[3541.82 --> 3542.42]  you're connected
[3542.42 --> 3543.34]  and it is
[3543.34 --> 3544.70]  a strong signal.
[3546.34 --> 3547.28]  John is saying
[3547.28 --> 3548.36]  that our love
[3548.36 --> 3549.36]  for other people
[3549.36 --> 3551.12]  is like this Wi-Fi sign
[3551.12 --> 3551.82]  on our phones.
[3552.26 --> 3552.90]  In that,
[3552.98 --> 3553.52]  it shows us
[3553.52 --> 3554.10]  whether or not
[3554.10 --> 3554.78]  we are connected
[3554.78 --> 3555.30]  to God
[3555.30 --> 3556.60]  and it shows us
[3556.60 --> 3557.16]  how strong
[3557.16 --> 3558.18]  that connection is.
[3559.20 --> 3560.18]  And that tells us,
[3560.30 --> 3560.48]  friends,
[3560.58 --> 3561.28]  that our love
[3561.28 --> 3562.00]  for other people
[3562.00 --> 3562.72]  in the church
[3562.72 --> 3564.48]  is of crucial importance.
[3565.14 --> 3565.86]  It tells us
[3565.86 --> 3566.38]  if we have
[3566.38 --> 3567.24]  a strong connection
[3567.24 --> 3567.84]  with God
[3567.84 --> 3570.20]  or if our connection
[3570.20 --> 3570.68]  with God
[3570.68 --> 3571.44]  is kind of weak
[3571.44 --> 3573.42]  or whether it exists
[3573.42 --> 3573.80]  at all.
[3575.12 --> 3576.38]  When John writes
[3576.38 --> 3578.10]  everyone who loves
[3578.10 --> 3579.04]  has been born
[3579.04 --> 3579.80]  of God
[3579.80 --> 3580.94]  and knows God,
[3581.20 --> 3582.08]  what he's saying
[3582.08 --> 3583.62]  is that to truly
[3583.62 --> 3584.50]  know the love
[3584.50 --> 3584.98]  of God,
[3585.38 --> 3586.52]  to be born
[3586.52 --> 3587.48]  of God
[3587.48 --> 3588.64]  so that as a child
[3588.64 --> 3590.02]  you begin to resemble
[3590.02 --> 3591.18]  your heavenly father
[3591.18 --> 3592.82]  means that the love
[3592.82 --> 3593.38]  of God
[3593.38 --> 3594.08]  will be evident
[3594.08 --> 3594.88]  in your life.
[3595.40 --> 3596.68]  Just like as a child
[3596.68 --> 3598.24]  we have a little baby
[3598.24 --> 3598.70]  in our church
[3598.70 --> 3599.00]  and we say,
[3599.12 --> 3599.28]  oh,
[3599.46 --> 3600.72]  he looks just like his mom
[3600.72 --> 3601.66]  or just like his dad,
[3601.72 --> 3601.92]  right?
[3602.14 --> 3602.98]  As a Christians
[3602.98 --> 3604.04]  people should look at us
[3604.04 --> 3604.68]  and say he looks
[3604.68 --> 3606.28]  just like his
[3606.28 --> 3607.68]  or her heavenly father
[3607.68 --> 3608.98]  because look at the way
[3608.98 --> 3610.10]  they love.
[3612.48 --> 3613.58]  Here's another example.
[3614.38 --> 3616.02]  If I come into contact
[3616.02 --> 3617.12]  with water,
[3618.32 --> 3618.84]  I am,
[3618.96 --> 3619.08]  you know,
[3619.12 --> 3619.56]  I wish.
[3620.34 --> 3621.12]  I come into contact
[3621.12 --> 3622.00]  with water right about now.
[3622.52 --> 3623.52]  If maybe someone
[3623.52 --> 3624.86]  sprays me with a hose,
[3625.80 --> 3626.44]  that's an invitation,
[3626.68 --> 3627.06]  just kidding,
[3627.16 --> 3628.90]  or throws a water balloon
[3628.90 --> 3629.48]  at me,
[3630.44 --> 3632.32]  now I've come into contact
[3632.32 --> 3633.04]  with water
[3633.04 --> 3634.78]  and it has had
[3634.78 --> 3635.86]  an effect on me.
[3636.20 --> 3637.28]  I've become what?
[3638.24 --> 3638.68]  Wet.
[3640.80 --> 3641.24]  Okay,
[3641.46 --> 3642.20]  I won't get off track.
[3642.66 --> 3643.74]  In a similar way,
[3643.74 --> 3644.58]  to be a Christian,
[3644.94 --> 3645.86]  to be born of God,
[3645.92 --> 3646.54]  to know God,
[3646.62 --> 3648.30]  means that you have come
[3648.30 --> 3649.54]  in contact with God
[3649.54 --> 3650.94]  and it's had an effect
[3650.94 --> 3651.48]  on you
[3651.48 --> 3652.98]  and you have become
[3652.98 --> 3655.22]  loving.
[3656.68 --> 3657.74]  because when we come
[3657.74 --> 3658.88]  into contact with God,
[3659.18 --> 3660.14]  something of God,
[3660.24 --> 3661.16]  who he is,
[3661.68 --> 3662.44]  affects us.
[3663.20 --> 3664.18]  So anyone who has been
[3664.18 --> 3665.16]  born of God
[3665.16 --> 3666.32]  begins to love people
[3666.32 --> 3667.18]  the way God loves.
[3668.40 --> 3669.04]  And now,
[3669.22 --> 3669.64]  if this,
[3670.38 --> 3671.70]  if love is really
[3671.70 --> 3672.38]  this important,
[3672.60 --> 3672.78]  right,
[3672.82 --> 3674.16]  that it is the essence
[3674.16 --> 3674.98]  of who God is
[3674.98 --> 3676.26]  and that the presence
[3676.26 --> 3677.48]  of it in our lives
[3677.48 --> 3678.40]  either reveals
[3678.40 --> 3679.34]  the strength
[3679.34 --> 3679.96]  of our connection
[3679.96 --> 3680.50]  with God
[3680.50 --> 3681.40]  or the lack of it,
[3681.86 --> 3682.92]  then it is very important
[3682.92 --> 3683.98]  for us to define
[3683.98 --> 3685.48]  what this love looks like.
[3685.48 --> 3686.24]  What is love?
[3687.26 --> 3687.92]  And that leads us
[3687.92 --> 3688.58]  to our third point
[3688.58 --> 3689.06]  this morning,
[3689.20 --> 3690.02]  the shape of love.
[3691.60 --> 3692.82]  Fortunately for us,
[3693.28 --> 3694.18]  John tells us
[3694.18 --> 3695.58]  what this love of God
[3695.58 --> 3696.34]  looks like.
[3696.72 --> 3697.52]  So let's read
[3697.52 --> 3698.56]  in verses 9 and 10.
[3699.82 --> 3701.06]  This is how God
[3701.06 --> 3701.96]  showed his love
[3701.96 --> 3702.64]  among us.
[3703.28 --> 3703.86]  He sent
[3703.86 --> 3705.40]  his one and only son
[3705.40 --> 3706.28]  into the world
[3706.28 --> 3707.50]  that we might live
[3707.50 --> 3708.10]  through him.
[3708.82 --> 3709.68]  This is love,
[3709.74 --> 3710.72]  not that we loved God,
[3710.80 --> 3711.82]  but that he loved us
[3711.82 --> 3713.22]  and sent his son
[3713.22 --> 3714.78]  as an atoning sacrifice
[3714.78 --> 3716.26]  for our sins.
[3718.34 --> 3719.66]  So John is saying
[3719.66 --> 3721.00]  that we can know
[3721.00 --> 3723.00]  what this love is
[3723.00 --> 3724.80]  because God
[3724.80 --> 3726.44]  has shown it to us.
[3726.48 --> 3726.94]  That's what it says
[3726.94 --> 3727.50]  right at the top.
[3728.28 --> 3729.78]  God has showed
[3729.78 --> 3730.86]  his love among us.
[3731.54 --> 3732.66]  We're not ignorant
[3732.66 --> 3734.76]  of what true love is.
[3735.20 --> 3735.40]  You know,
[3735.54 --> 3736.84]  if God is love
[3736.84 --> 3737.64]  and God has existed
[3737.64 --> 3738.42]  from all eternity
[3738.42 --> 3740.06]  as the spirit
[3740.06 --> 3741.30]  to father, son, and spirit,
[3741.98 --> 3742.82]  we might not know
[3742.82 --> 3743.36]  what that is,
[3743.46 --> 3744.68]  but God in his mercy
[3744.68 --> 3746.14]  has revealed it to us.
[3746.18 --> 3746.90]  He's shown us
[3746.90 --> 3747.48]  what it is.
[3747.90 --> 3748.78]  How has he shown it?
[3748.84 --> 3750.26]  And so as he shows us,
[3750.80 --> 3751.32]  what is it?
[3751.36 --> 3752.12]  What is this love?
[3753.56 --> 3754.38]  And John gives us
[3754.38 --> 3755.18]  three marks
[3755.18 --> 3757.38]  of true biblical love.
[3757.62 --> 3758.40]  And I want to show you
[3758.40 --> 3759.22]  what they are first
[3759.22 --> 3759.86]  and then we'll look
[3759.86 --> 3760.38]  at them briefly.
[3761.34 --> 3762.00]  Three marks
[3762.00 --> 3762.94]  of true biblical love
[3762.94 --> 3763.34]  is this.
[3763.44 --> 3764.12]  God's love
[3764.12 --> 3765.32]  is life-giving.
[3766.14 --> 3766.70]  God's love
[3766.70 --> 3767.44]  is sacrificial.
[3768.34 --> 3768.86]  God's love
[3768.86 --> 3769.48]  is unconditional.
[3769.48 --> 3770.32]  We see that
[3770.32 --> 3770.98]  in this passage.
[3771.54 --> 3772.00]  So first,
[3772.32 --> 3773.14]  God's love for us
[3773.14 --> 3774.04]  is life-giving.
[3774.48 --> 3775.02]  We see that
[3775.02 --> 3775.64]  in these verses.
[3776.66 --> 3777.44]  In verse 9,
[3777.60 --> 3778.12]  it says,
[3779.20 --> 3780.40]  He sent his only,
[3780.64 --> 3781.58]  one and only son
[3781.58 --> 3782.44]  into the world.
[3782.88 --> 3783.22]  Why?
[3784.58 --> 3787.14]  That we might live
[3787.14 --> 3788.18]  through him.
[3789.28 --> 3789.58]  See,
[3789.66 --> 3791.24]  God was concerned
[3791.24 --> 3793.24]  that we should have life.
[3794.16 --> 3794.90]  And we know
[3794.90 --> 3795.52]  from the Bible
[3795.52 --> 3796.52]  that what is the thing
[3796.52 --> 3797.72]  that takes away life
[3797.72 --> 3799.20]  is our sin.
[3799.96 --> 3800.90]  It's our turning away
[3800.90 --> 3801.40]  from God.
[3801.50 --> 3802.10]  We are cut off
[3802.10 --> 3802.68]  from the source
[3802.68 --> 3803.48]  of life itself.
[3804.32 --> 3805.28]  And that's why it says
[3805.28 --> 3806.26]  then in verse 10,
[3807.30 --> 3808.40]  He loved us
[3808.40 --> 3809.24]  and sent his son
[3809.24 --> 3810.52]  as an atoning sacrifice
[3810.52 --> 3812.32]  for our sins.
[3813.46 --> 3814.34]  So remember,
[3815.50 --> 3816.72]  God's wrath
[3816.72 --> 3818.54]  is a response
[3818.54 --> 3819.98]  to our sin.
[3819.98 --> 3821.48]  because sin
[3821.48 --> 3822.06]  is that
[3822.06 --> 3823.24]  which distorts
[3823.24 --> 3824.42]  and hinders
[3824.42 --> 3825.14]  his love
[3825.14 --> 3826.22]  moving towards
[3826.22 --> 3826.76]  his beloved.
[3827.46 --> 3828.34]  And because God
[3828.34 --> 3829.40]  is just,
[3829.54 --> 3830.42]  God is righteous,
[3830.86 --> 3832.12]  he will judge
[3832.12 --> 3833.04]  anything
[3833.04 --> 3834.18]  that opposes
[3834.18 --> 3835.04]  his love.
[3835.96 --> 3836.66]  But the Bible
[3836.66 --> 3837.20]  says
[3837.20 --> 3838.98]  that we are sinners.
[3839.70 --> 3840.36]  So God's
[3840.36 --> 3841.30]  righteous anger
[3841.30 --> 3842.28]  is actually
[3842.28 --> 3843.54]  towards us.
[3844.80 --> 3845.22]  And so what
[3845.22 --> 3846.00]  John says here
[3846.00 --> 3846.74]  is that God
[3846.74 --> 3848.42]  in his love
[3848.42 --> 3849.30]  sent his son
[3849.30 --> 3849.66]  Jesus
[3849.66 --> 3850.22]  to come
[3850.22 --> 3850.86]  and deal
[3850.86 --> 3851.52]  with the consequence
[3851.52 --> 3852.16]  of our sin.
[3852.40 --> 3853.14]  He sent Jesus
[3853.14 --> 3853.62]  to come
[3853.62 --> 3854.10]  and bear
[3854.10 --> 3854.94]  God's judgment
[3854.94 --> 3855.92]  for our sin
[3855.92 --> 3857.30]  that you and I
[3857.30 --> 3857.94]  should naturally
[3857.94 --> 3858.42]  bear
[3858.42 --> 3859.98]  so that we
[3859.98 --> 3860.64]  could have life.
[3861.92 --> 3862.90]  So that's the first
[3862.90 --> 3863.42]  thing when we say,
[3863.52 --> 3863.62]  well,
[3863.70 --> 3864.42]  what is love?
[3864.48 --> 3865.36]  What does it look like?
[3866.20 --> 3866.64]  Love
[3866.64 --> 3867.64]  is
[3867.64 --> 3869.08]  this coming
[3869.08 --> 3870.28]  first,
[3870.34 --> 3870.76]  it came into
[3870.76 --> 3871.42]  our lives
[3871.42 --> 3871.98]  and it bore
[3871.98 --> 3873.88]  our consequence,
[3874.08 --> 3874.62]  our judgment
[3874.62 --> 3876.20]  to give us life.
[3876.20 --> 3877.38]  And so when we
[3877.38 --> 3877.86]  think about
[3877.86 --> 3878.30]  what it means
[3878.30 --> 3878.80]  for us to love
[3878.80 --> 3879.26]  others,
[3880.16 --> 3880.38]  well,
[3880.44 --> 3881.16]  this is our model.
[3881.40 --> 3882.20]  It means coming
[3882.20 --> 3883.36]  into another person's
[3883.36 --> 3883.72]  life,
[3884.28 --> 3884.86]  to seeing what
[3884.86 --> 3885.52]  is their deepest
[3885.52 --> 3886.04]  need,
[3886.10 --> 3886.62]  in our cases
[3886.62 --> 3887.24]  our sin,
[3887.66 --> 3888.12]  but we see
[3888.12 --> 3888.88]  what is the deepest
[3888.88 --> 3889.48]  need in someone
[3889.48 --> 3889.86]  else,
[3890.22 --> 3891.18]  and we seek
[3891.18 --> 3892.44]  to give them
[3892.44 --> 3893.18]  life in that
[3893.18 --> 3893.60]  place.
[3895.18 --> 3896.04]  So secondly,
[3896.26 --> 3896.78]  we see that
[3896.78 --> 3897.44]  God's love
[3897.44 --> 3898.62]  is sacrificial,
[3899.70 --> 3899.94]  right?
[3899.98 --> 3901.10]  That this love
[3901.10 --> 3902.88]  costs something.
[3903.26 --> 3904.22]  It is costly.
[3904.22 --> 3906.94]  Psalm 50
[3906.94 --> 3907.88]  says that
[3907.88 --> 3909.00]  God owns
[3909.00 --> 3909.32]  what?
[3910.56 --> 3911.30]  The cows
[3911.30 --> 3911.92]  on a thousand
[3911.92 --> 3912.36]  hills.
[3912.66 --> 3912.90]  I don't know
[3912.90 --> 3913.34]  if our cow
[3913.34 --> 3913.90]  farmers like
[3913.90 --> 3914.26]  that verse
[3914.26 --> 3914.56]  or not,
[3915.34 --> 3916.38]  but it's a
[3916.38 --> 3917.06]  vivid image.
[3917.92 --> 3918.60]  Everything in
[3918.60 --> 3919.52]  creation belongs
[3919.52 --> 3919.94]  to him,
[3920.88 --> 3921.68]  but God,
[3922.78 --> 3923.48]  when he saw
[3923.48 --> 3924.20]  our deepest
[3924.20 --> 3924.66]  need,
[3925.22 --> 3925.66]  did he give
[3925.66 --> 3926.10]  us a cow?
[3926.98 --> 3927.38]  He said,
[3927.46 --> 3928.34]  I have millions
[3928.34 --> 3928.86]  of cows,
[3929.06 --> 3929.50]  here's a cow.
[3929.86 --> 3930.10]  No,
[3930.32 --> 3930.70]  that's not what
[3930.70 --> 3930.98]  he did.
[3931.64 --> 3932.38]  He didn't
[3932.38 --> 3932.88]  give us
[3932.88 --> 3933.50]  something out
[3933.50 --> 3934.30]  of his abundance
[3934.30 --> 3934.74]  where he
[3934.74 --> 3935.24]  wouldn't even
[3935.24 --> 3936.22]  notice that
[3936.22 --> 3936.74]  he gave us
[3936.74 --> 3938.10]  something because
[3938.10 --> 3938.50]  he has so
[3938.50 --> 3938.94]  much of it.
[3939.00 --> 3939.16]  No,
[3939.24 --> 3939.68]  instead,
[3940.12 --> 3940.74]  what did
[3940.74 --> 3941.14]  he give
[3941.14 --> 3941.38]  us?
[3941.48 --> 3942.00]  Verse 10,
[3943.34 --> 3943.94]  he loved
[3943.94 --> 3945.44]  us and
[3945.44 --> 3946.70]  sent his
[3946.70 --> 3947.02]  son.
[3948.30 --> 3949.12]  God only
[3949.12 --> 3950.52]  had one
[3950.52 --> 3951.48]  son,
[3952.18 --> 3952.86]  and Jesus
[3952.86 --> 3953.50]  was the
[3953.50 --> 3954.42]  most precious,
[3954.98 --> 3955.38]  the most
[3955.38 --> 3956.28]  valuable thing
[3956.28 --> 3956.66]  of all,
[3957.58 --> 3958.70]  and he gave
[3958.70 --> 3959.34]  it to us.
[3959.98 --> 3960.30]  And not
[3960.30 --> 3960.80]  only that,
[3960.88 --> 3961.26]  when Jesus
[3961.26 --> 3962.14]  came and
[3962.14 --> 3963.16]  he suffered
[3963.16 --> 3963.82]  for us
[3963.82 --> 3964.60]  and died
[3964.60 --> 3965.08]  for us,
[3965.10 --> 3965.34]  and this
[3965.34 --> 3965.90]  love was
[3965.90 --> 3966.48]  immensely
[3966.48 --> 3967.02]  costly.
[3967.92 --> 3968.48]  Jesus gave
[3968.48 --> 3968.94]  up his
[3968.94 --> 3969.94]  life to
[3969.94 --> 3970.52]  give us
[3970.52 --> 3971.00]  life at
[3971.00 --> 3972.40]  great cost
[3972.40 --> 3973.70]  to himself.
[3974.98 --> 3975.76]  This is the
[3975.76 --> 3976.32]  love that God
[3976.32 --> 3976.64]  has given
[3976.64 --> 3977.08]  us.
[3977.62 --> 3978.02]  And so,
[3978.24 --> 3978.96]  God has
[3978.96 --> 3979.86]  showed us
[3979.86 --> 3980.50]  this costly
[3980.50 --> 3980.90]  love,
[3981.26 --> 3981.66]  and what that
[3981.66 --> 3982.16]  means is when
[3982.16 --> 3982.70]  we have to
[3982.70 --> 3983.38]  love others,
[3983.48 --> 3983.80]  what does it
[3983.80 --> 3984.04]  mean?
[3985.06 --> 3985.68]  It's going
[3985.68 --> 3986.18]  to cost.
[3986.82 --> 3987.22]  It's going
[3987.22 --> 3987.88]  to cost us.
[3988.12 --> 3988.42]  We're going
[3988.42 --> 3988.98]  to feel it,
[3989.54 --> 3990.02]  and that's why
[3990.02 --> 3990.64]  it's so hard.
[3992.26 --> 3992.76]  Third,
[3993.28 --> 3994.06]  God's love
[3994.06 --> 3995.44]  is unconditional.
[3997.28 --> 3997.96]  It's not
[3997.96 --> 3998.56]  only meeting
[3998.56 --> 3999.00]  us at our
[3999.00 --> 3999.78]  deepest need
[3999.78 --> 4000.34]  to give us
[4000.34 --> 4000.82]  life,
[4001.38 --> 4002.00]  and it is not
[4002.00 --> 4002.86]  only sacrificial,
[4003.02 --> 4003.48]  but it is also
[4003.48 --> 4004.08]  unconditional,
[4004.26 --> 4004.64]  and we see
[4004.64 --> 4005.10]  that in verse
[4005.10 --> 4005.42]  10.
[4006.96 --> 4008.10]  This is love,
[4008.78 --> 4010.06]  not that we
[4010.06 --> 4010.82]  loved God,
[4011.52 --> 4012.32]  but that he
[4012.32 --> 4012.98]  loved us.
[4014.00 --> 4014.50]  And this
[4014.50 --> 4015.06]  shows us that
[4015.06 --> 4015.68]  God's love for
[4015.68 --> 4016.40]  us is always
[4016.40 --> 4017.44]  an initiating
[4017.44 --> 4017.84]  love.
[4018.74 --> 4019.20]  God doesn't
[4019.20 --> 4019.54]  say,
[4019.54 --> 4020.14]  you know,
[4020.22 --> 4020.92]  I can love
[4020.92 --> 4021.16]  you,
[4021.28 --> 4021.56]  and here
[4021.56 --> 4021.80]  are my
[4021.80 --> 4022.26]  terms and
[4022.26 --> 4022.64]  conditions.
[4023.52 --> 4024.10]  You've got
[4024.10 --> 4024.88]  to do this
[4024.88 --> 4025.26]  and this
[4025.26 --> 4025.64]  and this
[4025.64 --> 4026.00]  for me,
[4026.04 --> 4026.32]  and if you
[4026.32 --> 4026.70]  meet these
[4026.70 --> 4027.70]  10 conditions
[4027.70 --> 4028.24]  perfectly,
[4028.92 --> 4030.38]  then you
[4030.38 --> 4030.68]  win the
[4030.68 --> 4031.10]  prize,
[4031.22 --> 4031.48]  which is
[4031.48 --> 4031.82]  my love
[4031.82 --> 4032.16]  for you.
[4032.58 --> 4032.86]  No.
[4034.00 --> 4034.40]  God's
[4034.40 --> 4035.10]  love for
[4035.10 --> 4036.16]  us wasn't
[4036.16 --> 4036.78]  conditional
[4036.78 --> 4037.50]  on our
[4037.50 --> 4038.32]  prior love
[4038.32 --> 4038.86]  for God.
[4040.62 --> 4041.32]  The Bible
[4041.32 --> 4041.84]  says in
[4041.84 --> 4042.48]  Romans 5,
[4042.56 --> 4042.88]  8,
[4043.74 --> 4045.36]  God shows
[4045.36 --> 4046.00]  or demonstrates
[4046.00 --> 4046.80]  his own love
[4046.80 --> 4047.26]  for us in
[4047.26 --> 4047.58]  this.
[4048.00 --> 4048.72]  While we
[4048.72 --> 4049.20]  were still
[4049.20 --> 4049.82]  sinners,
[4050.84 --> 4051.38]  Christ died
[4051.38 --> 4051.66]  for us.
[4051.74 --> 4052.14]  While we
[4052.14 --> 4052.56]  were still
[4052.56 --> 4053.14]  in rebellion
[4053.14 --> 4053.92]  against God,
[4054.24 --> 4054.70]  while we
[4054.70 --> 4055.08]  were still
[4055.08 --> 4055.96]  disobeying
[4055.96 --> 4056.84]  his ways,
[4057.88 --> 4059.08]  while we
[4059.08 --> 4059.40]  wanted to
[4059.40 --> 4059.76]  have nothing
[4059.76 --> 4060.14]  to do with
[4060.14 --> 4060.34]  him,
[4061.00 --> 4061.46]  he died
[4061.46 --> 4061.98]  for us.
[4062.94 --> 4063.52]  So God
[4063.52 --> 4063.96]  comes to
[4063.96 --> 4064.58]  bestow his
[4064.58 --> 4065.08]  love on us
[4065.08 --> 4065.72]  even when we
[4065.72 --> 4066.36]  did not want
[4066.36 --> 4067.54]  to love him,
[4068.02 --> 4068.64]  even in our
[4068.64 --> 4068.88]  sin.
[4069.42 --> 4069.88]  So friends,
[4069.94 --> 4070.54]  this is God's
[4070.54 --> 4070.84]  love.
[4071.52 --> 4072.42]  It's sacrificial.
[4073.36 --> 4074.38]  He gave his,
[4074.38 --> 4075.38]  Jesus came
[4075.38 --> 4075.66]  to die
[4075.66 --> 4076.18]  for us.
[4076.80 --> 4077.10]  It is
[4077.10 --> 4077.68]  unconditional.
[4078.20 --> 4078.64]  God sets
[4078.64 --> 4078.94]  his love
[4078.94 --> 4079.40]  upon us
[4079.40 --> 4079.66]  out of
[4079.66 --> 4080.12]  his free
[4080.12 --> 4080.44]  grace,
[4080.50 --> 4081.12]  even when
[4081.12 --> 4081.56]  we were
[4081.56 --> 4082.14]  undeserving
[4082.14 --> 4082.98]  and unloving.
[4083.32 --> 4083.64]  And that
[4083.64 --> 4084.04]  means when
[4084.04 --> 4084.82]  we have
[4084.82 --> 4085.22]  to go
[4085.22 --> 4085.72]  to love
[4085.72 --> 4086.28]  other people,
[4087.58 --> 4088.24]  we can't,
[4088.66 --> 4089.02]  if it's
[4089.02 --> 4089.72]  true biblical
[4089.72 --> 4090.26]  love,
[4090.56 --> 4090.90]  it's not
[4090.90 --> 4091.60]  because they
[4091.60 --> 4092.20]  deserve it.
[4092.76 --> 4093.08]  It's not
[4093.08 --> 4093.46]  because they
[4093.46 --> 4094.14]  did something
[4094.14 --> 4095.14]  where we
[4095.14 --> 4095.42]  say,
[4095.50 --> 4095.74]  oh yes,
[4095.76 --> 4095.98]  I better
[4095.98 --> 4096.30]  love them
[4096.30 --> 4096.68]  back.
[4097.10 --> 4097.24]  No,
[4097.42 --> 4098.56]  love means
[4098.56 --> 4100.00]  to seek
[4100.00 --> 4100.54]  their good
[4100.54 --> 4101.52]  in life
[4101.52 --> 4102.64]  sacrificially,
[4102.90 --> 4103.92]  even when
[4103.92 --> 4104.20]  they don't
[4104.20 --> 4104.76]  deserve it
[4104.76 --> 4106.22]  because that's
[4106.22 --> 4106.50]  what God
[4106.50 --> 4106.80]  did for
[4106.80 --> 4107.16]  us.
[4107.68 --> 4108.08]  That is
[4108.08 --> 4108.40]  love.
[4111.30 --> 4111.92]  This is
[4111.92 --> 4112.24]  radical.
[4112.52 --> 4113.00]  This is a
[4113.00 --> 4113.34]  radical
[4113.34 --> 4114.02]  definition
[4114.02 --> 4114.64]  of love,
[4114.78 --> 4115.36]  but this
[4115.36 --> 4115.72]  is the
[4115.72 --> 4116.14]  love that
[4116.14 --> 4116.74]  God shows
[4116.74 --> 4117.06]  us.
[4117.36 --> 4117.58]  And that
[4117.58 --> 4117.88]  leads us
[4117.88 --> 4118.14]  to our
[4118.14 --> 4118.66]  last and
[4118.66 --> 4119.32]  final point,
[4119.64 --> 4120.14]  fourth point
[4120.14 --> 4120.66]  this morning,
[4121.10 --> 4121.60]  the sharing
[4121.60 --> 4122.10]  of love.
[4123.32 --> 4124.04]  Let's read
[4124.04 --> 4124.62]  verse 11.
[4125.74 --> 4126.44]  Dear friends,
[4126.96 --> 4127.82]  since God
[4127.82 --> 4128.76]  so loved
[4128.76 --> 4129.10]  us,
[4129.24 --> 4129.62]  he loved
[4129.62 --> 4130.06]  us in this
[4130.06 --> 4130.48]  way that
[4130.48 --> 4130.74]  he just
[4130.74 --> 4131.24]  talked about,
[4131.70 --> 4132.52]  we also
[4132.52 --> 4133.36]  ought to
[4133.36 --> 4133.78]  love
[4133.78 --> 4134.24]  one
[4134.24 --> 4134.70]  another.
[4136.00 --> 4136.68]  So John
[4136.68 --> 4137.08]  is saying
[4137.08 --> 4137.46]  that because
[4137.46 --> 4137.94]  God has
[4137.94 --> 4138.36]  calm and
[4138.36 --> 4138.66]  he loved
[4138.66 --> 4138.90]  us in
[4138.90 --> 4139.38]  this way,
[4140.22 --> 4140.84]  this is
[4140.84 --> 4141.20]  the love
[4141.20 --> 4141.52]  that we
[4141.52 --> 4141.74]  are to
[4141.74 --> 4142.26]  have for
[4142.26 --> 4142.80]  each other
[4142.80 --> 4143.42]  in the
[4143.42 --> 4143.86]  body of
[4143.86 --> 4144.32]  Christ.
[4145.00 --> 4145.28]  He's
[4145.28 --> 4145.76]  specifically
[4145.76 --> 4146.50]  writing to
[4146.50 --> 4147.04]  the church,
[4147.54 --> 4148.12]  the love
[4148.12 --> 4148.46]  that they
[4148.46 --> 4148.66]  are to
[4148.66 --> 4149.12]  have for
[4149.12 --> 4149.62]  one another
[4149.62 --> 4150.28]  in the
[4150.28 --> 4150.50]  church
[4150.50 --> 4150.84]  body.
[4151.90 --> 4152.40]  Let me
[4152.40 --> 4152.74]  use this
[4152.74 --> 4153.18]  example.
[4154.44 --> 4154.88]  Imagine
[4154.88 --> 4155.36]  you are
[4155.36 --> 4155.74]  wondering
[4155.74 --> 4156.44]  how much
[4156.44 --> 4157.74]  money you
[4157.74 --> 4158.22]  have that
[4158.22 --> 4158.46]  you can
[4158.46 --> 4158.80]  give other
[4158.80 --> 4159.10]  people.
[4159.68 --> 4160.20]  So let's
[4160.20 --> 4160.46]  say you
[4160.46 --> 4160.72]  go to
[4160.72 --> 4161.12]  your bank,
[4161.52 --> 4162.08]  you look
[4162.08 --> 4162.28]  in your
[4162.28 --> 4162.82]  bank account
[4162.82 --> 4163.58]  and you
[4163.58 --> 4164.26]  realize that
[4164.26 --> 4164.64]  your bank
[4164.64 --> 4165.68]  account is
[4165.68 --> 4166.88]  zero.
[4167.60 --> 4168.18]  Not a good
[4168.18 --> 4168.40]  day.
[4169.62 --> 4170.18]  There is
[4170.18 --> 4170.70]  nothing in
[4170.70 --> 4171.00]  your bank
[4171.00 --> 4171.40]  account,
[4171.66 --> 4172.00]  therefore you
[4172.00 --> 4172.40]  have nothing
[4172.40 --> 4172.80]  to give
[4172.80 --> 4173.40]  other people.
[4173.58 --> 4173.88]  You're not
[4173.88 --> 4174.30]  able to
[4174.30 --> 4174.62]  give, you
[4174.62 --> 4175.08]  have nothing
[4175.08 --> 4175.54]  to give.
[4175.94 --> 4176.36]  But if
[4176.36 --> 4177.00]  God comes
[4177.00 --> 4177.22]  and he
[4177.22 --> 4177.96]  deposits a
[4177.96 --> 4178.86]  million dollars
[4178.86 --> 4180.30]  into your
[4180.30 --> 4180.86]  bank account,
[4181.30 --> 4182.30]  now you
[4182.30 --> 4182.74]  have something
[4182.74 --> 4183.08]  to give
[4183.08 --> 4183.60]  other people.
[4184.16 --> 4184.78]  In that,
[4184.92 --> 4185.24]  you can
[4185.24 --> 4185.68]  give what
[4185.68 --> 4186.00]  you have
[4186.00 --> 4186.60]  received from
[4186.60 --> 4186.90]  God.
[4187.22 --> 4187.76]  And that
[4187.76 --> 4188.62]  is exactly
[4188.62 --> 4189.04]  what God
[4189.04 --> 4189.32]  has done
[4189.32 --> 4189.84]  for us.
[4190.34 --> 4190.92]  John says,
[4191.24 --> 4191.84]  since God
[4191.84 --> 4192.58]  so loved
[4192.58 --> 4193.58]  us, right,
[4193.64 --> 4194.16]  our bank
[4194.16 --> 4194.72]  accounts have
[4194.72 --> 4195.34]  been filled
[4195.34 --> 4196.96]  up by the
[4196.96 --> 4197.48]  love of
[4197.48 --> 4197.96]  God, which
[4197.96 --> 4198.50]  is a love
[4198.50 --> 4198.82]  that is
[4198.82 --> 4199.70]  just immeasurable.
[4200.50 --> 4200.98]  We have
[4200.98 --> 4201.62]  this love,
[4201.84 --> 4203.44]  therefore we
[4203.44 --> 4203.88]  can give
[4203.88 --> 4204.06]  it.
[4204.82 --> 4205.36]  We have
[4205.36 --> 4205.66]  it to
[4205.66 --> 4206.00]  give.
[4206.62 --> 4207.24]  Romans 5
[4207.24 --> 4207.80]  5 says
[4207.80 --> 4208.10]  it this
[4208.10 --> 4208.32]  way,
[4209.32 --> 4209.66]  God's
[4209.66 --> 4210.16]  love has
[4210.16 --> 4210.70]  been poured
[4210.70 --> 4211.42]  out into
[4211.42 --> 4212.08]  our hearts
[4212.08 --> 4212.78]  through the
[4212.78 --> 4213.32]  Holy Spirit
[4213.32 --> 4213.92]  who has
[4213.92 --> 4214.24]  been given
[4214.24 --> 4214.72]  to us.
[4214.88 --> 4215.48]  We have
[4215.48 --> 4215.80]  the love
[4215.80 --> 4216.16]  of God.
[4216.24 --> 4216.42]  How do
[4216.42 --> 4216.78]  we get
[4216.78 --> 4216.96]  it?
[4217.26 --> 4217.76]  The Holy
[4217.76 --> 4218.38]  Spirit has
[4218.38 --> 4218.90]  come into
[4218.90 --> 4219.58]  our hearts,
[4220.08 --> 4221.48]  pouring the
[4221.48 --> 4222.02]  love of
[4222.02 --> 4222.54]  God into
[4222.54 --> 4223.20]  our hearts.
[4224.36 --> 4224.60]  And so
[4224.60 --> 4224.96]  when we
[4224.96 --> 4225.88]  receive Christ
[4225.88 --> 4226.48]  by faith,
[4226.82 --> 4227.36]  God pours
[4227.36 --> 4227.66]  his love
[4227.66 --> 4228.02]  into our
[4228.02 --> 4228.36]  hearts by
[4228.36 --> 4228.66]  the Holy
[4228.66 --> 4228.98]  Spirit.
[4229.22 --> 4229.78]  He fills
[4229.78 --> 4230.08]  up our
[4230.08 --> 4230.28]  bank
[4230.28 --> 4230.82]  accounts
[4230.82 --> 4231.90]  with his
[4231.90 --> 4232.30]  love,
[4232.60 --> 4233.10]  and now
[4233.10 --> 4233.42]  having
[4233.42 --> 4234.04]  received
[4234.04 --> 4234.68]  his love,
[4234.86 --> 4235.36]  we have
[4235.36 --> 4236.00]  been plunged
[4236.00 --> 4236.46]  into the
[4236.46 --> 4237.04]  water of
[4237.04 --> 4237.38]  God's
[4237.38 --> 4237.70]  love,
[4237.98 --> 4238.26]  and we
[4238.26 --> 4238.58]  have this
[4238.58 --> 4239.14]  very rich
[4239.14 --> 4239.74]  resource
[4239.74 --> 4240.76]  with which
[4240.76 --> 4241.04]  we can
[4241.04 --> 4241.22]  love
[4241.22 --> 4241.60]  others.
[4244.96 --> 4245.54]  But it's
[4245.54 --> 4246.08]  not easy,
[4246.66 --> 4247.28]  as we've
[4247.28 --> 4247.52]  said.
[4247.52 --> 4248.70]  And it's
[4248.70 --> 4248.98]  really,
[4249.18 --> 4249.62]  what is
[4249.62 --> 4250.14]  easy is
[4250.14 --> 4250.40]  to make
[4250.40 --> 4250.76]  this very
[4250.76 --> 4251.14]  abstract.
[4251.90 --> 4252.30]  What is
[4252.30 --> 4252.92]  very easy
[4252.92 --> 4253.42]  is to
[4253.42 --> 4254.66]  romanticize
[4254.66 --> 4255.66]  about the
[4255.66 --> 4256.02]  love of
[4256.02 --> 4256.54]  God and
[4256.54 --> 4257.02]  the love
[4257.02 --> 4257.54]  of Christian
[4257.54 --> 4258.10]  community.
[4259.10 --> 4259.88]  It's easy
[4259.88 --> 4260.16]  to have
[4260.16 --> 4261.20]  great ideas
[4261.20 --> 4262.68]  about love,
[4262.84 --> 4263.46]  but when it
[4263.46 --> 4263.82]  comes to
[4263.82 --> 4264.50]  actually loving
[4264.50 --> 4265.00]  the person
[4265.00 --> 4265.44]  that God
[4265.44 --> 4265.86]  has put
[4265.86 --> 4266.36]  into my
[4266.36 --> 4266.78]  life,
[4267.26 --> 4267.66]  it is
[4267.66 --> 4268.08]  not so
[4268.08 --> 4268.38]  easy.
[4269.26 --> 4269.60]  And we
[4269.60 --> 4269.94]  all know
[4269.94 --> 4270.20]  this.
[4270.26 --> 4270.56]  We all
[4270.56 --> 4270.92]  know this
[4270.92 --> 4271.40]  from personal
[4271.40 --> 4272.06]  experience.
[4273.12 --> 4273.60]  I came
[4273.60 --> 4274.08]  across this
[4274.08 --> 4274.48]  week a
[4274.48 --> 4275.60]  quote by
[4275.60 --> 4276.46]  the Peruvian
[4276.46 --> 4277.16]  theologian
[4277.16 --> 4277.72]  and priest
[4277.72 --> 4278.86]  Gustavo
[4278.86 --> 4279.76]  Gutierrez.
[4281.88 --> 4283.10]  He asked
[4283.10 --> 4283.88]  this very
[4283.88 --> 4285.78]  hard question.
[4286.90 --> 4287.56]  You say
[4287.56 --> 4288.06]  you care
[4288.06 --> 4288.44]  about the
[4288.44 --> 4288.72]  poor?
[4289.42 --> 4290.24]  Then tell
[4290.24 --> 4290.56]  me,
[4291.06 --> 4291.98]  what are
[4291.98 --> 4292.64]  their names?
[4294.72 --> 4295.18]  That is
[4295.18 --> 4297.18]  very powerful.
[4298.30 --> 4298.66]  And in
[4298.66 --> 4299.50]  many ways,
[4300.12 --> 4300.56]  John is
[4300.56 --> 4300.94]  saying,
[4301.36 --> 4301.78]  you say
[4301.78 --> 4302.30]  you love
[4302.30 --> 4302.86]  your neighbor?
[4303.90 --> 4304.52]  Then tell
[4304.52 --> 4304.84]  me,
[4305.56 --> 4306.14]  what are
[4306.14 --> 4306.78]  their names?
[4307.08 --> 4307.46]  Which
[4307.46 --> 4308.60]  neighbors
[4308.60 --> 4309.80]  do you
[4309.80 --> 4310.22]  love?
[4311.26 --> 4312.04]  In other
[4312.04 --> 4312.50]  words,
[4312.70 --> 4313.58]  we can
[4313.58 --> 4313.94]  have all
[4313.94 --> 4314.28]  the right
[4314.28 --> 4314.94]  ideas about
[4314.94 --> 4315.22]  God's
[4315.22 --> 4315.52]  love.
[4315.92 --> 4316.34]  We can
[4316.34 --> 4316.78]  talk all
[4316.78 --> 4317.20]  day about
[4317.20 --> 4317.50]  God's
[4317.50 --> 4317.74]  love.
[4318.00 --> 4318.22]  We can
[4318.22 --> 4319.30]  make big
[4319.30 --> 4319.86]  symbolic
[4319.86 --> 4320.74]  gestures about
[4320.74 --> 4321.10]  God's
[4321.10 --> 4321.34]  love.
[4321.48 --> 4321.86]  But if
[4321.86 --> 4322.18]  it never
[4322.18 --> 4322.58]  becomes
[4322.58 --> 4323.28]  concrete
[4323.28 --> 4324.52]  in loving
[4324.52 --> 4325.42]  real people,
[4326.40 --> 4326.92]  especially
[4326.92 --> 4327.32]  in the
[4327.32 --> 4327.70]  church,
[4328.40 --> 4328.96]  it's not
[4328.96 --> 4329.54]  as John
[4329.54 --> 4330.26]  says in
[4330.26 --> 4330.70]  verse 12,
[4330.80 --> 4331.16]  I believe,
[4331.16 --> 4332.04]  making love
[4332.04 --> 4332.54]  complete.
[4333.00 --> 4333.60]  It's not
[4333.60 --> 4334.50]  bringing it
[4334.50 --> 4334.88]  to its
[4334.88 --> 4335.34]  fullness.
[4336.36 --> 4337.20]  Because love
[4337.20 --> 4337.48]  is not
[4337.48 --> 4338.56]  primarily an
[4338.56 --> 4338.92]  emotion,
[4339.16 --> 4339.48]  it's not
[4339.48 --> 4340.10]  a sentiment,
[4340.90 --> 4341.74]  it is an
[4341.74 --> 4342.14]  action.
[4344.16 --> 4345.16]  But relating
[4345.16 --> 4345.74]  to people
[4345.74 --> 4346.28]  and loving
[4346.28 --> 4346.82]  one another
[4346.82 --> 4347.38]  in community
[4347.38 --> 4347.78]  is not
[4347.78 --> 4348.06]  easy.
[4348.98 --> 4349.12]  You know,
[4349.18 --> 4349.82]  we have
[4349.82 --> 4350.58]  this illusion
[4350.58 --> 4351.82]  that somewhere
[4351.82 --> 4352.74]  out there
[4352.74 --> 4354.12]  around us
[4354.12 --> 4354.34]  in the
[4354.34 --> 4354.60]  world,
[4354.76 --> 4355.44]  there is a
[4355.44 --> 4356.20]  group of
[4356.20 --> 4357.20]  awesome people
[4357.20 --> 4358.46]  to do
[4358.46 --> 4358.92]  community
[4358.92 --> 4359.38]  with,
[4359.82 --> 4360.16]  and that
[4360.16 --> 4360.44]  they are
[4360.44 --> 4360.94]  so easy
[4360.94 --> 4361.40]  to love.
[4361.66 --> 4361.90]  Somewhere
[4361.90 --> 4362.36]  else,
[4362.44 --> 4362.66]  there are
[4362.66 --> 4363.08]  people who
[4363.08 --> 4363.42]  are easy
[4363.42 --> 4363.82]  to love.
[4365.74 --> 4366.52]  Has anybody
[4366.52 --> 4366.90]  seen the
[4366.90 --> 4367.28]  movie As
[4367.28 --> 4367.62]  Good As
[4367.62 --> 4368.08]  It Gets?
[4368.24 --> 4368.54]  It's an
[4368.54 --> 4369.22]  older movie,
[4369.40 --> 4369.82]  it has
[4369.82 --> 4370.54]  Helen Hunt
[4370.54 --> 4371.44]  and Jack
[4371.44 --> 4371.88]  Nicholson.
[4372.40 --> 4372.50]  Okay,
[4372.56 --> 4372.70]  so,
[4373.16 --> 4373.34]  yeah,
[4373.58 --> 4374.18]  Helen Hunt,
[4374.46 --> 4375.02]  Jack Nicholson
[4375.02 --> 4375.32]  is her
[4375.32 --> 4375.88]  boyfriend in
[4375.88 --> 4376.24]  the movie,
[4376.70 --> 4377.66]  and he
[4377.66 --> 4378.10]  is really
[4378.10 --> 4378.74]  kind,
[4378.88 --> 4379.22]  he is so
[4379.22 --> 4379.84]  generous to
[4379.84 --> 4380.16]  her and
[4380.16 --> 4380.76]  her son,
[4381.14 --> 4382.06]  but he
[4382.06 --> 4382.68]  is so
[4382.68 --> 4383.18]  hard to
[4383.18 --> 4383.62]  deal with.
[4384.10 --> 4384.62]  He is
[4384.62 --> 4385.04]  totally
[4385.04 --> 4385.78]  offensive,
[4386.36 --> 4386.86]  and he
[4386.86 --> 4387.40]  is rude
[4387.40 --> 4388.14]  to everybody
[4388.14 --> 4388.82]  else around
[4388.82 --> 4389.08]  him.
[4389.08 --> 4390.16]  And at
[4390.16 --> 4390.70]  one point,
[4390.78 --> 4391.32]  Helen Hunt
[4391.32 --> 4391.78]  says to
[4391.78 --> 4392.22]  her mother,
[4392.60 --> 4393.20]  I just
[4393.20 --> 4393.72]  want a
[4393.72 --> 4394.12]  normal
[4394.12 --> 4394.54]  boyfriend.
[4395.54 --> 4396.18]  And her
[4396.18 --> 4396.78]  mother says,
[4396.86 --> 4397.08]  dear,
[4397.36 --> 4398.12]  everybody wants
[4398.12 --> 4398.70]  one of those,
[4399.16 --> 4399.76]  but there's
[4399.76 --> 4400.12]  no such
[4400.12 --> 4400.36]  thing.
[4402.12 --> 4403.04]  Sometimes we
[4403.04 --> 4403.34]  say,
[4403.46 --> 4404.12]  I just want a
[4404.12 --> 4404.82]  normal church
[4404.82 --> 4405.56]  to do community
[4405.56 --> 4405.92]  with,
[4406.42 --> 4407.02]  and John
[4407.02 --> 4407.82]  says to us,
[4408.22 --> 4408.54]  dear,
[4408.54 --> 4409.42]  everybody wants
[4409.42 --> 4409.98]  one of those,
[4410.42 --> 4411.30]  but there's no
[4411.30 --> 4411.70]  such thing.
[4411.70 --> 4414.54]  there's no
[4414.54 --> 4415.52]  easy-to-love
[4415.52 --> 4416.00]  body of
[4416.00 --> 4416.40]  Christ,
[4416.98 --> 4417.12]  right,
[4417.16 --> 4417.84]  because love
[4417.84 --> 4419.84]  is sacrificial.
[4420.50 --> 4421.02]  It is
[4421.02 --> 4421.76]  unconditional,
[4422.68 --> 4423.62]  and it is
[4423.62 --> 4424.96]  to seek the
[4424.96 --> 4425.38]  life of
[4425.38 --> 4425.96]  another person.
[4427.00 --> 4427.44]  And the
[4427.44 --> 4427.94]  people we're
[4427.94 --> 4428.44]  called to
[4428.44 --> 4429.64]  love are
[4429.64 --> 4430.08]  messy,
[4430.50 --> 4431.32]  broken people
[4431.32 --> 4431.86]  who need a
[4431.86 --> 4432.14]  savior,
[4432.50 --> 4433.18]  just like you
[4433.18 --> 4433.46]  and me.
[4434.24 --> 4434.90]  That's what
[4434.90 --> 4435.24]  the church
[4435.24 --> 4435.56]  is.
[4436.74 --> 4437.16]  And so
[4437.16 --> 4437.62]  the work
[4437.62 --> 4438.06]  then of
[4438.06 --> 4438.50]  renewing
[4438.50 --> 4439.00]  community
[4439.00 --> 4440.40]  is hard
[4440.40 --> 4440.70]  work.
[4440.70 --> 4441.54]  It takes
[4441.54 --> 4442.02]  listening,
[4443.02 --> 4443.34]  it takes
[4443.34 --> 4444.08]  understanding,
[4444.72 --> 4445.50]  and patience,
[4445.92 --> 4446.24]  and not
[4446.24 --> 4448.30]  holding
[4448.30 --> 4448.92]  grudges.
[4449.90 --> 4450.46]  It places
[4450.46 --> 4451.34]  demands on
[4451.34 --> 4452.04]  us of
[4452.04 --> 4452.54]  our time,
[4452.66 --> 4453.26]  of our energy,
[4453.42 --> 4453.62]  of our
[4453.62 --> 4454.08]  emotions.
[4455.08 --> 4455.76]  And we
[4455.76 --> 4456.36]  have to say,
[4456.48 --> 4456.92]  you matter
[4456.92 --> 4457.40]  more than
[4457.40 --> 4457.66]  me.
[4458.64 --> 4459.24]  I must
[4459.24 --> 4459.92]  decrease
[4459.92 --> 4461.12]  so that
[4461.12 --> 4461.42]  you may
[4461.42 --> 4461.92]  increase.
[4462.88 --> 4463.76]  So the
[4463.76 --> 4464.24]  question for
[4464.24 --> 4464.54]  us today
[4464.54 --> 4465.02]  is simple.
[4466.26 --> 4466.92]  Are you
[4466.92 --> 4468.16]  willing,
[4468.34 --> 4468.86]  or are you
[4468.86 --> 4469.38]  doing the
[4469.38 --> 4469.96]  hard work
[4469.96 --> 4471.00]  of renewing
[4471.00 --> 4471.44]  community?
[4472.06 --> 4472.64]  And I
[4472.64 --> 4473.10]  know in
[4473.10 --> 4473.50]  so many
[4473.50 --> 4473.90]  ways we
[4473.90 --> 4474.20]  are.
[4474.44 --> 4474.94]  We are.
[4475.06 --> 4476.10]  We love
[4476.10 --> 4476.54]  one another.
[4476.74 --> 4477.12]  We're doing
[4477.12 --> 4477.56]  community
[4477.56 --> 4478.00]  together.
[4478.50 --> 4479.18]  But also,
[4479.30 --> 4479.54]  this is
[4479.54 --> 4480.04]  something that
[4480.04 --> 4480.30]  we can
[4480.30 --> 4480.98]  always grow
[4480.98 --> 4481.64]  in with
[4481.64 --> 4482.00]  God's
[4482.00 --> 4482.32]  help.
[4483.14 --> 4483.58]  Right?
[4483.64 --> 4483.92]  And because
[4483.92 --> 4484.42]  community
[4484.42 --> 4485.24]  doesn't just
[4485.24 --> 4485.56]  happen.
[4486.24 --> 4486.80]  We have to
[4486.80 --> 4487.36]  decide to
[4487.36 --> 4487.64]  do it.
[4487.86 --> 4488.30]  If we
[4488.30 --> 4488.74]  don't decide
[4488.74 --> 4489.12]  to do it,
[4489.18 --> 4489.50]  it's just
[4489.50 --> 4489.82]  not going
[4489.82 --> 4490.12]  to happen.
[4491.06 --> 4491.66]  We have
[4491.66 --> 4492.20]  to initiate.
[4492.74 --> 4493.12]  We have
[4493.12 --> 4493.56]  to move
[4493.56 --> 4494.10]  towards one
[4494.10 --> 4494.42]  another.
[4494.84 --> 4495.26]  And we
[4495.26 --> 4495.78]  have to do
[4495.78 --> 4496.38]  the hard work
[4496.38 --> 4496.96]  of loving
[4496.96 --> 4497.52]  one another
[4497.52 --> 4498.38]  as God,
[4498.62 --> 4499.10]  our Heavenly
[4499.10 --> 4499.44]  Father,
[4499.50 --> 4499.86]  has loved
[4499.86 --> 4500.20]  us.
[4500.98 --> 4501.42]  So let me
[4501.42 --> 4501.80]  pray that
[4501.80 --> 4502.10]  God would
[4502.10 --> 4502.62]  help us.
[4504.32 --> 4505.00]  Oh Lord,
[4505.10 --> 4505.62]  the depth
[4505.62 --> 4506.64]  of this text
[4506.64 --> 4507.36]  is so rich
[4507.36 --> 4507.84]  and beautiful.
[4508.96 --> 4509.78]  And I pray
[4509.78 --> 4510.24]  that you
[4510.24 --> 4510.76]  would keep
[4510.76 --> 4511.48]  bringing us
[4511.48 --> 4512.06]  back to it.
[4512.12 --> 4512.48]  And by your
[4512.48 --> 4513.10]  Holy Spirit,
[4514.14 --> 4514.34]  Lord,
[4514.38 --> 4514.60]  would you
[4514.60 --> 4515.16]  help us
[4515.16 --> 4515.70]  to know
[4515.70 --> 4516.50]  and experience
[4516.50 --> 4517.36]  more and
[4517.36 --> 4518.10]  more fully
[4518.10 --> 4518.90]  the reality
[4518.90 --> 4519.96]  that you
[4519.96 --> 4520.76]  love us
[4520.76 --> 4525.80]  and that
[4525.80 --> 4526.20]  you call
[4526.20 --> 4526.54]  us to
[4526.54 --> 4526.92]  love one
[4526.92 --> 4527.22]  another.
[4528.28 --> 4528.56]  Lord,
[4528.60 --> 4528.80]  would you
[4528.80 --> 4529.24]  build us
[4529.24 --> 4529.56]  into a
[4529.56 --> 4529.92]  community
[4529.92 --> 4530.40]  of your
[4530.40 --> 4530.72]  love?
[4531.24 --> 4531.78]  We pray
[4531.78 --> 4532.38]  through Christ
[4532.38 --> 4532.82]  our Lord.
[4533.40 --> 4533.74]  Amen.
[4536.08 --> 4536.62]  All right,
[4536.64 --> 4537.28]  let's stand
[4537.28 --> 4538.06]  and let's
[4538.06 --> 4539.36]  sing our
[4539.36 --> 4539.98]  song of
[4539.98 --> 4540.48]  response,
[4540.64 --> 4541.02]  the servant
[4541.02 --> 4541.42]  song.
[4550.76 --> 4551.76]  song.
[4551.76 --> 4552.40]  Let me
[4552.40 --> 4565.84]  be your
[4565.84 --> 4566.54]  servant,
[4567.08 --> 4568.02]  let me
[4568.02 --> 4569.02]  be our
[4569.02 --> 4569.94]  voice to
[4569.94 --> 4570.70]  you.
[4570.70 --> 4572.30]  Pray that
[4572.30 --> 4573.96]  I may have
[4573.96 --> 4574.98]  the grace
[4574.98 --> 4576.02]  to let
[4576.02 --> 4577.12]  you be
[4577.12 --> 4577.72]  my
[4577.72 --> 4578.58]  servant
[4578.58 --> 4580.58]  you.
[4582.34 --> 4583.44]  We are
[4583.44 --> 4584.52]  pilgrims
[4584.52 --> 4585.62]  on a
[4585.62 --> 4586.30]  journey,
[4586.86 --> 4587.74]  we are
[4587.74 --> 4588.64]  travelers
[4588.64 --> 4589.92]  on the
[4589.92 --> 4590.68]  road,
[4591.10 --> 4592.22]  we are
[4592.22 --> 4593.16]  here to
[4593.16 --> 4594.34]  help each
[4594.34 --> 4595.14]  other
[4595.14 --> 4596.60]  walk the
[4596.60 --> 4597.22]  mile
[4597.22 --> 4597.86]  and
[4597.86 --> 4599.36]  bare
[4599.36 --> 4600.34]  road.
[4602.88 --> 4604.02]  I will
[4604.02 --> 4604.96]  hold the
[4604.96 --> 4605.52]  Christ
[4605.52 --> 4606.60]  light for
[4606.60 --> 4607.02]  you
[4607.02 --> 4608.28]  in the
[4608.28 --> 4609.40]  night time
[4609.40 --> 4610.30]  of your
[4610.30 --> 4611.16]  fear.
[4611.66 --> 4612.68]  I will
[4612.68 --> 4613.74]  hold my
[4613.74 --> 4614.82]  hand out
[4614.82 --> 4615.72]  to you,
[4616.06 --> 4617.08]  speak that
[4617.08 --> 4618.24]  peace you
[4618.24 --> 4620.14]  long to
[4620.14 --> 4621.50]  hear.
[4623.14 --> 4624.30]  I will
[4624.30 --> 4625.48]  weep when
[4625.48 --> 4626.62]  you are
[4626.62 --> 4627.60]  weeping,
[4627.84 --> 4628.82]  when you
[4628.82 --> 4629.54]  laugh,
[4629.66 --> 4630.14]  I'll
[4630.14 --> 4631.24]  laugh with
[4631.24 --> 4631.84]  you.
[4632.54 --> 4633.58]  I will
[4633.58 --> 4634.74]  share your
[4634.74 --> 4635.90]  joy and
[4635.90 --> 4636.62]  sorrow,
[4636.62 --> 4636.80]  all,
[4637.08 --> 4638.16]  till we've
[4638.16 --> 4639.28]  seen this
[4639.28 --> 4640.00]  journey
[4640.00 --> 4642.08]  through.
[4644.60 --> 4645.70]  Will you
[4645.70 --> 4646.66]  let me
[4646.66 --> 4647.86]  be your
[4647.86 --> 4648.52]  servant,
[4648.52 --> 4649.88]  let me
[4649.88 --> 4650.98]  be as
[4650.98 --> 4651.52]  Christ
[4651.52 --> 4652.58]  to you,
[4652.58 --> 4654.16]  pray that
[4654.16 --> 4655.26]  I may
[4655.26 --> 4656.32]  have the
[4656.32 --> 4657.26]  grace to
[4657.26 --> 4658.42]  let you
[4658.42 --> 4659.64]  be my
[4659.64 --> 4661.58]  servant
[4661.58 --> 4663.00]  to you.
[4672.24 --> 4672.82]  So we
[4672.82 --> 4673.30]  continue to
[4673.30 --> 4673.72]  worship the
[4673.72 --> 4674.26]  Lord with
[4674.26 --> 4674.60]  the giving
[4674.60 --> 4674.88]  of our
[4674.88 --> 4675.28]  tithes and
[4675.28 --> 4675.68]  offerings,
[4675.68 --> 4676.58]  and in
[4676.58 --> 4677.04]  doing that
[4677.04 --> 4677.66]  we acknowledge
[4677.66 --> 4678.36]  that all
[4678.36 --> 4678.84]  that we
[4678.84 --> 4680.42]  have does
[4680.42 --> 4680.90]  come from
[4680.90 --> 4681.30]  God,
[4681.78 --> 4682.68]  given to
[4682.68 --> 4683.02]  us in
[4683.02 --> 4683.34]  love,
[4684.22 --> 4684.70]  and given
[4684.70 --> 4685.52]  to us that
[4685.52 --> 4685.88]  we might
[4685.88 --> 4686.54]  share it in
[4686.54 --> 4687.04]  love with
[4687.04 --> 4687.44]  others.
[4688.26 --> 4688.56]  So our
[4688.56 --> 4689.20]  destiny offering
[4689.20 --> 4689.88]  today is for
[4689.88 --> 4690.48]  world renew,
[4690.48 --> 4690.92]  women of
[4690.92 --> 4691.20]  hope,
[4691.30 --> 4691.96]  and hope
[4691.96 --> 4692.22]  you had a
[4692.22 --> 4692.76]  chance already
[4692.76 --> 4693.30]  to look at
[4693.30 --> 4694.34]  this insert
[4694.34 --> 4694.56]  in your
[4694.56 --> 4695.04]  bulletin that
[4695.04 --> 4695.28]  tells you
[4695.28 --> 4695.68]  more about
[4695.68 --> 4695.88]  it.
[4696.54 --> 4696.82]  But at
[4696.82 --> 4697.34]  this time I'd
[4697.34 --> 4697.66]  like to
[4697.66 --> 4698.24]  invite the
[4698.24 --> 4699.10]  deacons to
[4699.10 --> 4699.72]  come forward
[4699.72 --> 4700.84]  and collect
[4700.84 --> 4701.26]  the morning
[4701.26 --> 4701.60]  offering.
[4720.48 --> 4726.48] ores Mazini
[4740.96 --> 4742.08]  therein
[4742.08 --> 4742.30]  a
[4742.30 --> 4743.30]  the
[4743.30 --> 4744.12]  won't
[4744.12 --> 4746.12]  Amen.
[4774.12 --> 4776.12]  Amen.
[4804.12 --> 4805.12]  Amen.
[4805.12 --> 4818.78]  That's very beautiful, Roger.
[4818.78 --> 4820.66]  Thank you.
[4820.66 --> 4823.32]  Let's come before the Lord in a prayer of supplication.
[4823.32 --> 4828.08]  And today I want to specifically pray for mothers, as it's Mother's Day, and also for
[4828.08 --> 4829.08]  children.
[4829.08 --> 4830.58]  Let's pray for those things.
[4830.58 --> 4837.16]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we thank you that you are a God of love and that we are
[4837.16 --> 4839.42]  your beloved children.
[4839.42 --> 4845.60]  We thank you that you know us intimately and you deeply love us.
[4845.60 --> 4851.90]  We thank you that you have invited us into your life of mutual delight and sustenance.
[4851.90 --> 4857.04]  We thank you that you dwell in your people and have formed us together into your body,
[4857.04 --> 4859.26]  the church.
[4859.26 --> 4864.78]  We thank you that you have not left this world without your presence and love, but instead
[4864.78 --> 4871.56]  you indwell us your church with your love and presence so that we can then see and testify
[4871.56 --> 4873.22]  of your love to others.
[4873.22 --> 4878.84]  And this morning, Father, we thank you for the love that you give us through mothers.
[4878.84 --> 4885.32]  Father, we thank you for the mothers in our lives, for the gift of mothers.
[4885.32 --> 4891.84]  Lord, for all the mothers, Lord, that we know and love, would you bestow upon them today your
[4891.84 --> 4892.20]  blessing?
[4892.56 --> 4895.06]  Would they know especially your deep love for them?
[4895.06 --> 4901.58]  Lord, would you give us thankful hearts for the mothers that you have given us?
[4901.58 --> 4910.02]  Lord, in your incarnation and life on this earth, you showed us that you deeply value children
[4910.02 --> 4913.58]  and you enthusiastically welcome them into your kingdom.
[4913.58 --> 4920.66]  Lord, work in our hearts and lives to form us into your image so that we might also joyfully,
[4920.66 --> 4924.10]  enthusiastically welcome children.
[4924.10 --> 4930.10]  That we would step into opportunities that we have to care for our children through the
[4930.10 --> 4936.10]  ministries of our church, through a nursery, children's Sunday school, gems and cadets and
[4936.10 --> 4938.60]  basic skills camp.
[4938.60 --> 4943.74]  We ask that you would particularly provide us with a children's ministry coordinator.
[4943.74 --> 4946.92]  Bring us a worker to join us in the sacred work.
[4946.92 --> 4950.16]  And may our children's ministry be marked by your love.
[4950.16 --> 4953.66]  And Lord, we pray for our children.
[4953.66 --> 4959.56]  Guide us to make this church a place of safe hospitality for all children.
[4959.56 --> 4964.68]  Please use us to teach our children to know your voice as their good shepherd and to joyfully
[4964.68 --> 4970.48]  abide in you and obey your teachings, bearing much fruit in their lives.
[4970.48 --> 4976.00]  Form us, Lord, into a body so thoroughly marked by your love that our children are forever grounded
[4976.00 --> 4978.60]  in your love for them.
[4978.60 --> 4983.06]  And you teach us, Lord, that if we want to enter your kingdom, we must become like little
[4983.06 --> 4984.54]  children.
[4984.54 --> 4989.52]  So Lord, use our children, our grandchildren, the children that you have given us as a church
