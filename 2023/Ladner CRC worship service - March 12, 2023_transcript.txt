[50.54 --> 52.54]  Amen.
[80.54 --> 82.54]  Amen.
[110.54 --> 112.54]  Amen.

[200.54 --> 202.54]  Amen.
[230.54 --> 232.54]  Amen.
[260.54 --> 265.00]  Good morning.
[266.32 --> 271.80]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church, and we are so, so grateful to have you here
[271.80 --> 273.04]  this morning to worship together.
[273.62 --> 278.84]  Welcome to the folks who are joining us on livestream, and also to all of you who are
[278.84 --> 279.04]  here.
[279.80 --> 281.04]  My name is Jason Truel.
[281.12 --> 285.00]  I will be leading us in the worship this morning.
[285.00 --> 293.00]  And we are coming here this morning maybe a little bit tired, not just because we lost
[293.00 --> 297.10]  an hour of sleep, but also maybe just it was a long week.
[298.08 --> 303.50]  Or maybe we have failed in some way, and we're coming in limping.
[304.94 --> 310.78]  And what we're going to do this morning is we are here to receive God's grace.
[310.78 --> 316.26]  We are here to receive his mercy.
[316.80 --> 319.30]  We are here to understand his forgiveness.
[320.04 --> 324.98]  And so that we can leave here today assured of God's love for us.
[325.26 --> 328.50]  And so that we could be the people God's called us to be.
[330.04 --> 333.12]  And so quick announcement, or two announcements before we get going.
[333.24 --> 337.16]  The first one is there was, it's in your bulletin, there was supposed to be a choir.
[337.44 --> 338.20]  I think it was tonight.
[338.34 --> 339.48]  I forgot to double check.
[339.48 --> 342.98]  The children's choir, yeah.
[343.22 --> 346.30]  So I just got a text from Pastor Danny at Lighthouse.
[346.74 --> 348.44]  The choir is stuck in Uganda.
[349.08 --> 350.36]  So don't come tonight.
[350.64 --> 354.58]  It's rescheduled for April 2nd.
[354.94 --> 355.96]  Okay, so don't go tonight.
[356.22 --> 357.70]  It's rescheduled for April 2nd.
[358.04 --> 360.06]  And I'll let John make another announcement.
[360.06 --> 377.52]  On behalf of Council, I would like to congratulate Pastor Jason upon the completion of transferring his ordination to the Christian Reformed Church.
[377.52 --> 383.38]  Pastor Jason has been taking courses through Calvin Theological Seminary for the past three years.
[383.90 --> 386.04]  In addition to doing his regular duties.
[387.30 --> 392.68]  Pastor Jason spoke very well this past week during his interview at our classes meeting.
[392.68 --> 398.90]  Thanks to those church members who came out to support Pastor Jason in this interview.
[399.50 --> 405.44]  A special thank you to Christy and their children for their support during these past years.
[405.44 --> 412.24]  We pray for a continued blessing for Pastor Jason and his family in their ministry among us.
[412.24 --> 412.82]  Thank you.
[427.82 --> 429.30]  One more final announcement.
[429.62 --> 434.54]  I hope you found your next Bible reading bookmarks in your bulletin.
[435.36 --> 439.00]  And because the one we had passed out last week ends on Thursday.
[439.00 --> 443.24]  And so for the season of Lent, if you'd like, you can keep reading in the Bible.
[443.38 --> 444.72]  It gives you a reading for each day.
[445.94 --> 447.98]  Now, sometimes you might miss a day.
[448.08 --> 449.32]  And that's perfectly okay.
[449.44 --> 450.74]  It's not something to worry about.
[451.44 --> 452.96]  You don't have to make it up.
[453.12 --> 456.80]  You just, whatever day it is, even if you haven't opened up the Bible in a week,
[456.84 --> 460.06]  you just read what God has to say for you that day.
[460.84 --> 462.24]  And then just move on.
[462.24 --> 462.68]  Okay.
[462.68 --> 472.32]  So let us now hear and respond to God's call to worship to us from the psalmist, Psalm 36.
[474.60 --> 478.20]  So, and also please join me in reading the parts that are indicated.
[478.20 --> 484.30]  How priceless is your unfailing love, O God.
[484.96 --> 488.52]  People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[489.66 --> 497.26]  They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from your river of delights.
[497.26 --> 500.78]  For with you is the fountain of life.
[501.48 --> 504.34]  In your light do we see light.
[504.34 --> 513.70]  Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart.
[513.88 --> 514.86]  Let us pray together.
[515.54 --> 522.32]  Thank you, Lord, that we can come into this place, and together praise your holy name,
[523.02 --> 527.90]  and receive your abundant mercies and grace.
[527.90 --> 534.70]  Lord, we come here to drink from the fountain of life, which is to know you and be known by you.
[535.36 --> 539.56]  Thank you that you are our shepherd, and that you have not left us to want.
[540.56 --> 545.80]  And we are grateful that you lead us in your ways, and that you are faithful to your promises,
[546.58 --> 548.82]  and you are faithful to your covenant forever.
[549.44 --> 550.70]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[551.16 --> 551.50]  Amen.
[551.50 --> 551.58]  Amen.
[552.30 --> 556.58]  Please stand for God's greeting to us this morning from Psalm 86, verse 5.
[558.10 --> 564.96]  You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you.
[565.98 --> 569.90]  So as you are able, please, well, you're all standing mostly,
[570.18 --> 575.40]  but please turn to those around you and especially greet someone who you've maybe never met.
[575.40 --> 575.80]  Amen.
[575.80 --> 575.88]  Amen.
[575.88 --> 576.40]  Amen.
[576.40 --> 576.48]  Amen.
[576.48 --> 576.52]  Amen.
[576.52 --> 576.54]  Amen.
[576.54 --> 576.58]  Amen.
[576.58 --> 577.54]  Amen.
[577.54 --> 577.58]  Amen.
[577.58 --> 577.62]  Amen.
[581.50 --> 582.50]  Amen.
[611.50 --> 619.58]  Amen.
[619.58 --> 621.08]  Amen.
[625.04 --> 625.56]  Amen.
[625.56 --> 625.72]  Amen.
[625.72 --> 628.06]  Amen.
[628.06 --> 630.20]  Amen.
[635.70 --> 640.42]  Amen.
[640.42 --> 640.52]  Oo.
[640.52 --> 650.00]  Blessed be your name
[650.00 --> 654.00]  The land that is plentiful
[654.00 --> 658.36]  With streams of abundance flow
[658.36 --> 660.46]  Blessed be your name
[660.46 --> 666.72]  Blessed be your name
[666.72 --> 670.90]  We're found in the desert place
[670.90 --> 674.96]  We're all through the wilderness
[674.96 --> 677.68]  Blessed be your name
[677.68 --> 683.98]  Every blessing you pour out
[683.98 --> 687.90]  Turn back to praise
[687.90 --> 692.14]  When the darkness closes in more
[692.14 --> 694.94]  Still I will say
[694.94 --> 698.94]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[698.94 --> 702.18]  Blessed be your name
[702.18 --> 707.20]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[707.20 --> 711.12]  Blessed be your glorious name
[711.12 --> 718.46]  Blessed be your name
[718.46 --> 722.58]  The sun's shining down on me
[722.58 --> 726.72]  When the world's all as it should be
[726.72 --> 729.82]  Blessed be your name
[729.82 --> 734.82]  Blessed be your name
[734.82 --> 738.58]  The Lord our Christ's offering
[738.58 --> 742.58]  The Lord's giving me offering
[742.58 --> 744.82]  Blessed be your name
[744.82 --> 750.82]  Every blessing you pour out
[750.82 --> 755.82]  Turn back to praise
[755.82 --> 760.00]  When the darkness closes in more
[760.00 --> 762.78]  Still I will say
[762.78 --> 766.06]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[766.06 --> 771.06]  Blessed be your name
[771.06 --> 771.30]  Blessed be your name
[771.30 --> 772.70]  Blessed be the name
[772.70 --> 773.94]  The Lord
[773.94 --> 774.40]  Was it you know
[774.40 --> 775.30]  The name of the Lord
[775.30 --> 780.34]  Blessed be your glorious day
[780.34 --> 784.00]  You give and take away
[785.06 --> 788.40]  I give and take away
[788.40 --> 789.30]  Give and take away
[789.30 --> 794.14]  My heart will choose to say
[794.14 --> 798.32]  Blessed be your name
[798.32 --> 801.98]  You give and take away
[801.98 --> 805.82]  You give and take away
[805.82 --> 810.26]  My heart will choose to say
[810.26 --> 814.40]  Blessed be your name
[814.40 --> 819.68]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[819.68 --> 823.26]  Blessed be your name
[823.26 --> 827.78]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[827.78 --> 832.50]  Blessed be your glorious name
[844.40 --> 857.44]  My hope is built on nothing less
[857.44 --> 861.38]  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[861.38 --> 866.14]  I dare not trust the sweetest way
[866.14 --> 870.98]  But only lead on Jesus' name
[870.98 --> 876.32]  On Christ the solid rock I stand
[876.32 --> 880.80]  All other ground is sinking sand
[880.80 --> 886.68]  All other ground is sinking sand
[886.68 --> 891.72]  When darkness fails His lovely face
[891.72 --> 896.18]  The rest of His unchanging grace
[896.18 --> 900.16]  In every high and storm we give
[900.16 --> 905.08]  My anger holds within the veil
[905.08 --> 910.28]  On Christ the solid rock I stand
[910.28 --> 914.76]  All other ground is sinking sand
[914.76 --> 920.50]  All other ground is sinking sand
[920.50 --> 925.42]  All other ground is sinking sand
[925.42 --> 926.42]  All other ground is sinking sand
[926.42 --> 932.34]  All other ground is sinking sand
[932.34 --> 934.56]  my soul gives me
[934.56 --> 936.36]  he then is
[936.36 --> 938.16]  all my hope
[938.16 --> 939.54]  and stay
[939.54 --> 942.12]  on Christ's
[942.12 --> 943.68]  soul and
[943.68 --> 947.52]  all the ground
[947.52 --> 949.54]  is sinking sand
[949.54 --> 952.32]  all the ground
[952.32 --> 953.74]  is sinking
[953.74 --> 955.82]  sand
[955.82 --> 957.98]  when you
[957.98 --> 960.04]  shall come with
[960.04 --> 961.48]  trump and sound
[961.48 --> 963.30]  no way I
[963.30 --> 965.14]  have in him
[965.14 --> 966.10]  he fell
[966.10 --> 969.60]  in his righteousness
[969.60 --> 970.80]  of hope
[970.80 --> 973.52]  all us to stand
[973.52 --> 974.80]  free from
[974.80 --> 976.96]  the floor
[976.96 --> 978.44]  all cast
[978.44 --> 980.52]  his soul and
[980.52 --> 984.68]  all the ground
[984.68 --> 985.88]  is sinking
[985.88 --> 986.78]  sand
[986.78 --> 989.96]  all the ground
[989.96 --> 991.60]  is sinking
[991.60 --> 993.62]  sand
[993.62 --> 1000.18]  finally a song of prayer
[1000.18 --> 1001.22]  to have the Lord
[1001.22 --> 1001.96]  open our eyes
[1001.96 --> 1002.78]  so we can see
[1002.78 --> 1004.34]  him for the way
[1004.34 --> 1004.98]  that he is
[1004.98 --> 1006.16]  and hear his word
[1006.16 --> 1007.80]  today that he would
[1007.80 --> 1008.90]  share with us
[1008.90 --> 1030.12]  open the eyes of my heart
[1030.12 --> 1031.12]  Lord
[1031.12 --> 1033.78]  open the eyes of my heart
[1033.78 --> 1036.70]  I want to see
[1036.70 --> 1037.66]  you
[1037.66 --> 1040.88]  I want to see
[1040.88 --> 1042.24]  you
[1042.24 --> 1046.92]  open the eyes of my heart
[1046.92 --> 1047.86]  Lord
[1047.86 --> 1051.44]  open the eyes of my heart
[1051.44 --> 1053.34]  I want to see
[1053.34 --> 1054.34]  you
[1054.34 --> 1057.60]  I want to see
[1057.60 --> 1058.72]  you
[1058.72 --> 1061.18]  see you
[1061.18 --> 1062.88]  high and lifted
[1062.88 --> 1063.78]  up
[1063.78 --> 1066.74]  shining in the light
[1066.74 --> 1068.50]  of your glory
[1068.50 --> 1070.38]  know that you're
[1070.38 --> 1071.96]  never in love
[1071.96 --> 1073.48]  as we sing
[1073.48 --> 1074.22]  holy
[1074.22 --> 1075.22]  holy
[1075.22 --> 1076.06]  holy
[1076.06 --> 1082.16]  open the eyes of my heart
[1082.16 --> 1083.38]  Lord
[1083.38 --> 1086.28]  open the eyes of my heart
[1086.28 --> 1088.78]  I want to see
[1088.78 --> 1089.78]  you
[1089.78 --> 1092.90]  I want to see
[1092.90 --> 1093.98]  you
[1093.98 --> 1099.06]  open the eyes of my heart
[1099.06 --> 1100.06]  Lord
[1100.06 --> 1103.54]  open the eyes of my heart
[1103.54 --> 1105.92]  I want to see
[1105.92 --> 1106.66]  you
[1106.66 --> 1109.86]  I want to see
[1109.86 --> 1111.12]  you
[1111.12 --> 1112.86]  I want to see
[1112.86 --> 1113.38]  you
[1113.38 --> 1115.08]  high and lifted
[1115.08 --> 1116.20]  up
[1116.20 --> 1118.98]  shining in the light
[1118.98 --> 1120.40]  of your glory
[1120.40 --> 1122.70]  know that you're
[1122.70 --> 1124.26]  calling in love
[1124.26 --> 1125.76]  as we sing
[1125.76 --> 1126.48]  holy
[1126.48 --> 1127.48]  holy
[1127.48 --> 1128.38]  holy
[1128.38 --> 1132.66]  holy
[1132.66 --> 1134.54]  holy
[1134.54 --> 1138.54]  holy
[1138.54 --> 1140.54]  holy
[1141.74 --> 1142.94]  holy
[1142.94 --> 1144.10]  god
[1144.10 --> 1145.26]  holy
[1145.26 --> 1145.44]  holy
[1145.44 --> 1145.52]  holy
[1145.52 --> 1148.62]  holy
[1149.30 --> 1149.78]  holy
[1149.78 --> 1150.78]  holy
[1150.78 --> 1154.48]  holy
[1154.48 --> 1155.30]  holy
[1155.50 --> 1157.86]  holy
[1158.00 --> 1158.54]  holy
[1158.54 --> 1163.72]  Holy, holy, I want to see you.
[1166.72 --> 1167.80]  You may be seated.
[1177.70 --> 1183.26]  So as many of us will know, after our adoration comes confession.
[1184.04 --> 1186.72]  And this is not just because this is the order we do it in,
[1186.72 --> 1191.92]  but it's because when we take the time to gaze upon our God,
[1192.50 --> 1196.10]  we see ourselves more accurately.
[1197.26 --> 1202.60]  So confession is a time to mourn what we see when we honestly tell the truth
[1202.60 --> 1205.64]  about what is really in our hearts.
[1206.66 --> 1213.22]  So let's humbly come before the Lord together and ask him to expose those areas in us
[1213.22 --> 1219.26]  where we fail to love God and love our neighbor as God has called us to.
[1220.18 --> 1225.52]  And as we do so, we do so to be healed, to be forgiven, and to be made new.
[1226.14 --> 1230.02]  And so let's read this confession together.
[1230.42 --> 1233.48]  And I will begin and then I'll invite you to read it with me.
[1233.84 --> 1234.64]  Let's pray.
[1234.64 --> 1243.92]  Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed
[1243.92 --> 1249.06]  by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[1249.92 --> 1253.16]  We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1253.86 --> 1257.04]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1257.04 --> 1261.36]  We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
[1262.04 --> 1268.32]  For the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us.
[1268.90 --> 1273.76]  That we may delight in your will and walk in your ways.
[1274.06 --> 1276.28]  To the glory of your name.
[1276.84 --> 1277.30]  Amen.
[1277.30 --> 1285.92]  Now God in his boundless love and grace, he cleanses us, he forgives us, and he speaks
[1285.92 --> 1287.38]  to us words of pardon.
[1288.00 --> 1292.22]  So hear these words of forgiveness and pardon from Philippians chapter 3.
[1293.14 --> 1294.24]  Let's say this together.
[1294.36 --> 1296.94]  Brothers and sisters, what can wash away our sins?
[1297.62 --> 1299.62]  Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1300.52 --> 1305.76]  Our citizenship is in heaven and we eagerly await the Savior from there.
[1305.76 --> 1307.80]  The Lord Jesus Christ.
[1308.66 --> 1314.68]  Who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform
[1314.68 --> 1321.26]  our lowly bodies so that we will be like his glorious body.
[1322.32 --> 1323.08]  Amen.
[1323.78 --> 1325.38]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[1326.00 --> 1329.40]  Let's stand again and let's sing our next song together.
[1335.76 --> 1365.74]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1365.76 --> 1395.74]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1395.74 --> 1425.72]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1425.72 --> 1455.70]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1455.72 --> 1457.72]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1457.72 --> 1485.70]  Let's sing our next song together.
[1485.70 --> 1494.34]  Jesus died my soul to save, my lips shall still be clean.
[1495.14 --> 1503.52]  Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[1503.52 --> 1515.40]  Sin hath left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[1515.70 --> 1539.86]  It's very nice singing everyone.
[1539.86 --> 1540.86]  Amen.
[1540.86 --> 1551.86]  So this meal that we are about to partake in is an opportunity to encounter Jesus spiritually.
[1551.86 --> 1561.36]  It's an opportunity to have our faith strengthened, to have our hearts enlarged, and for us to
[1561.36 --> 1567.48]  sense his love for us, and for that sense of his love to be enlarged in us.
[1567.48 --> 1570.34]  That's the way these sacraments are designed to work.
[1570.76 --> 1577.30]  It's to help you, to encourage you, to meet you, and to increase your sense of how precious
[1577.30 --> 1579.50]  you are to the good shepherd.
[1580.80 --> 1585.90]  And that's what we pray will happen in this time now by the work of the Holy Spirit.
[1585.90 --> 1589.02]  And it is a distinctly spiritual experience.
[1589.16 --> 1593.64]  I mean, we're eating these common elements of bread and juice from the grape.
[1594.42 --> 1599.56]  But God takes these things and he spiritually nourishes us in them.
[1599.76 --> 1602.72]  And so it depends very much on faith.
[1603.66 --> 1606.04]  And that is why this table is for Christians.
[1606.04 --> 1623.26]  Parents, we leave it to you for whether you think your children are ready to partake based
[1623.26 --> 1625.20]  on an age-appropriate faith.
[1625.88 --> 1631.22]  But if you are here and you do not yet have faith in Jesus, then please do not take the
[1631.22 --> 1631.58]  elements.
[1631.58 --> 1636.54]  They are not yet for you, but we would love to talk to you about what it means to trust
[1636.54 --> 1636.96]  in Jesus.
[1637.46 --> 1642.08]  So please find Pastor Nancy or myself after the service, and we'd love to talk about that
[1642.08 --> 1642.44]  with you.
[1644.62 --> 1646.82]  So here are these words now of institution.
[1648.58 --> 1653.68]  The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks,
[1653.74 --> 1654.54]  he broke it.
[1655.12 --> 1657.60]  And he said, this is my body, which is for you.
[1658.36 --> 1660.30]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1660.30 --> 1667.38]  In the same way also, he took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant,
[1667.90 --> 1669.80]  the cup of the new covenant in my blood.
[1670.42 --> 1674.80]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[1675.32 --> 1680.56]  For as often as you eat this bread and you drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death
[1680.56 --> 1682.48]  until he comes again.
[1682.48 --> 1689.44]  So beloved of Christ, lift up your hearts.
[1690.40 --> 1692.26]  We lift them up to the Lord.
[1693.54 --> 1694.76]  We are his people.
[1695.68 --> 1697.88]  We are redeemed by his grace.
[1698.66 --> 1700.78]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1701.78 --> 1702.78]  Christ has died.
[1703.46 --> 1704.46]  Christ is risen.
[1705.18 --> 1706.76]  Christ will come again.
[1706.76 --> 1711.24]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1711.64 --> 1712.02]  Hallelujah.
[1713.12 --> 1713.64]  Hallelujah.
[1714.12 --> 1719.02]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God by his grace for you, his people.
[1719.90 --> 1722.34]  Take and feed on Christ.
[1722.68 --> 1728.40]  By faith, let him nourish you, trusting in his love for you.
[1728.40 --> 1733.86]  May I ask our elders and deacons who are serving to come forward and help me to distribute the elements.
[1733.86 --> 1755.72]  God.
[1755.72 --> 1785.70]  Thank you.
[1785.72 --> 1815.70]  Thank you.
[1815.72 --> 1845.70]  Thank you.
[1845.72 --> 1875.70]  Thank you.
[1875.72 --> 1905.70]  Thank you.
[1905.72 --> 1935.70]  Thank you.
[1935.70 --> 1937.70]  Thank you.
[1965.70 --> 1967.70]  Thank you.
[1995.70 --> 1997.70]  Thank you.
[2025.70 --> 2027.70]  Thank you.
[2055.70 --> 2057.70]  Thank you.
[2085.70 --> 2087.70]  Thank you.
[2115.70 --> 2117.70]  Thank you.
[2117.70 --> 2119.70]  Thank you.
[2119.70 --> 2121.70]  Thank you.
[2121.70 --> 2123.70]  Thank you.
[2123.70 --> 2125.70]  Thank you.
[2125.70 --> 2127.70]  Thank you.
[2127.70 --> 2129.70]  Thank you.
[2129.70 --> 2131.70]  Thank you.
[2131.70 --> 2133.70]  Thank you.
[2157.70 --> 2161.70]  Thank you.
[2161.70 --> 2163.70]  Thank you.
[2169.70 --> 2171.70]  Thank you.
[2171.70 --> 2174.72]  take, drink, remember and believe
[2174.72 --> 2176.58]  that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2176.58 --> 2178.32]  was shed for the forgiveness of many
[2178.32 --> 2179.28]  let's drink together
[2179.28 --> 2184.86]  please join me in prayer
[2184.86 --> 2188.58]  gracious Lord
[2188.58 --> 2190.04]  we praise you
[2190.04 --> 2191.08]  you are the redeemer
[2191.08 --> 2193.86]  you are our great high priest
[2193.86 --> 2195.84]  you are the lamb of God
[2195.84 --> 2197.74]  the perfect spotless lamb
[2197.74 --> 2198.46]  Lord you
[2198.46 --> 2201.42]  offered yourself to God
[2201.42 --> 2204.00]  as the perfect sacrifice
[2204.00 --> 2206.98]  Lord that all who put their trust in you
[2206.98 --> 2208.78]  might be forgiven and set free
[2208.78 --> 2211.40]  to live a new life
[2211.40 --> 2213.94]  to know you and find life in you
[2213.94 --> 2216.02]  and Lord we thank you for strengthening us
[2216.02 --> 2217.62]  here at this table
[2217.62 --> 2219.60]  and Lord thank you for your promise
[2219.60 --> 2222.04]  that you would be with your people always
[2222.04 --> 2223.40]  by your Holy Spirit
[2223.40 --> 2224.90]  Lord
[2224.90 --> 2227.28]  as we go from here later today
[2227.28 --> 2229.00]  Lord send us out to be
[2229.00 --> 2231.72]  your people to be salt and light
[2231.72 --> 2232.52]  in the world
[2232.52 --> 2233.62]  to proclaim
[2233.62 --> 2235.36]  the glorious name
[2235.36 --> 2236.46]  of our
[2236.46 --> 2238.90]  crucified and risen Savior
[2238.90 --> 2240.34]  we pray in Jesus name
[2240.34 --> 2240.80]  Amen
[2240.80 --> 2253.06]  so I'd like to invite the children
[2253.06 --> 2254.76]  to come and join me right up here
[2254.76 --> 2276.26]  good morning
[2276.26 --> 2284.08]  that's from how to train your dragon right
[2284.08 --> 2285.70]  is that right
[2285.70 --> 2286.38]  yeah
[2286.38 --> 2286.76]  okay
[2286.76 --> 2289.64]  you gotta stay up on these things
[2289.64 --> 2291.24]  all right
[2291.24 --> 2299.32]  hey you're all over there
[2299.32 --> 2300.92]  there's some space over here
[2300.92 --> 2301.70]  if anybody wants
[2301.70 --> 2303.20]  okay
[2303.20 --> 2304.18]  hello everyone
[2304.18 --> 2307.14]  how are you today
[2307.14 --> 2308.08]  good
[2308.08 --> 2308.74]  good
[2308.74 --> 2310.76]  are you all excited for spring break
[2310.76 --> 2312.56]  yes
[2312.56 --> 2314.34]  yeah
[2314.34 --> 2315.68]  we're already on spring break
[2315.68 --> 2316.14]  that's cool
[2316.14 --> 2316.98]  we got two weeks
[2316.98 --> 2319.06]  is anybody excited to do anything special
[2319.06 --> 2323.66]  okay
[2323.66 --> 2325.86]  well at least you'll have a break from school
[2325.86 --> 2326.38]  that's good
[2326.38 --> 2328.50]  question for you
[2328.50 --> 2331.52]  who here loves to eat salad
[2331.52 --> 2333.36]  really
[2333.36 --> 2334.76]  okay
[2334.76 --> 2336.78]  good for you all
[2336.78 --> 2337.76]  are you sure
[2337.76 --> 2340.40]  you love salad
[2340.40 --> 2340.72]  yeah
[2340.72 --> 2341.50]  that's right
[2341.50 --> 2342.32]  and
[2342.32 --> 2343.46]  what do I have here
[2343.46 --> 2345.12]  salad dressing
[2345.12 --> 2345.86]  that's right
[2345.86 --> 2346.92]  it's salad dressing
[2346.92 --> 2347.88]  yeah
[2347.88 --> 2350.16]  I'm going to read a passage of scripture
[2350.16 --> 2352.42]  and then I'm going to tell you more about my salad dressing
[2352.42 --> 2353.06]  okay
[2353.06 --> 2354.70]  so let me first read this
[2354.70 --> 2357.84]  here's something that Jesus tells us
[2357.84 --> 2360.14]  he says this
[2360.14 --> 2362.20]  no good tree
[2362.20 --> 2364.36]  bears bad fruit
[2364.36 --> 2366.30]  that makes sense right
[2366.30 --> 2367.70]  so if you have a good healthy tree
[2367.70 --> 2369.34]  what kind of fruit is it going to make
[2369.34 --> 2372.00]  good healthy fruit
[2372.00 --> 2372.40]  right
[2372.40 --> 2373.80]  delicious fruit
[2373.80 --> 2375.30]  if it's a bad tree
[2375.30 --> 2376.68]  if it's kind of sick
[2376.68 --> 2377.64]  or old
[2377.64 --> 2379.20]  and like just not good
[2379.20 --> 2380.44]  what kind of fruit is it going to make
[2380.44 --> 2383.02]  bad fruit
[2383.02 --> 2383.42]  exactly
[2383.42 --> 2383.88]  right
[2383.88 --> 2384.60]  so you got it
[2384.60 --> 2385.14]  so okay
[2385.14 --> 2386.66]  no good tree
[2386.66 --> 2387.88]  bears bad fruit
[2387.88 --> 2390.08]  nor does a bad tree
[2390.08 --> 2391.08]  bear good fruit
[2391.08 --> 2391.88]  each tree
[2391.88 --> 2392.92]  is recognized
[2392.92 --> 2394.06]  by its own fruit
[2394.06 --> 2396.60]  people do not pick figs
[2396.60 --> 2398.24]  from thorn bushes
[2398.24 --> 2399.84]  or grapes
[2399.84 --> 2401.08]  from briars
[2401.08 --> 2402.44]  the good
[2402.44 --> 2403.54]  man
[2403.54 --> 2404.86]  brings good things
[2404.86 --> 2405.64]  out of the good
[2405.64 --> 2406.90]  stored up in his heart
[2406.90 --> 2408.50]  and the evil man
[2408.50 --> 2409.56]  brings evil things
[2409.56 --> 2410.48]  out of the evil
[2410.48 --> 2411.68]  stored up in his heart
[2411.68 --> 2412.28]  for out
[2412.28 --> 2413.44]  of the overflow
[2413.44 --> 2414.42]  of his heart
[2414.42 --> 2415.40]  his mouth
[2415.40 --> 2416.02]  speaks
[2416.02 --> 2417.52]  so when Jesus
[2417.52 --> 2418.72]  is talking about trees
[2418.72 --> 2420.18]  he's actually
[2420.18 --> 2421.20]  painting us a picture
[2421.20 --> 2421.98]  of a person
[2421.98 --> 2424.00]  and when the bible talks
[2424.00 --> 2424.90]  about our hearts
[2424.90 --> 2426.26]  and it talks about
[2426.26 --> 2427.18]  that means everything
[2427.18 --> 2428.14]  about who you are
[2428.14 --> 2429.28]  deep inside
[2429.28 --> 2430.52]  okay we all have
[2430.52 --> 2431.04]  these hearts
[2431.04 --> 2431.54]  and so
[2431.54 --> 2432.90]  what is in
[2432.90 --> 2433.92]  your heart
[2433.92 --> 2435.74]  what is in your heart
[2435.74 --> 2436.36]  that's the question
[2436.36 --> 2438.04]  yeah good
[2438.04 --> 2439.08]  so this is
[2439.08 --> 2439.80]  let me connect it
[2439.80 --> 2440.60]  to my salad dressing
[2440.60 --> 2442.10]  see if this works
[2442.10 --> 2442.36]  okay
[2442.36 --> 2443.72]  so
[2443.72 --> 2444.94]  as you can see
[2444.94 --> 2446.84]  what's on the top here
[2446.84 --> 2447.58]  of the salad dressing
[2447.58 --> 2450.64]  this is kind of the oil
[2450.64 --> 2451.12]  on the top
[2451.12 --> 2451.70]  do you see that
[2451.70 --> 2452.44]  it's all the oil
[2452.44 --> 2453.68]  and then what's all this
[2453.68 --> 2456.56]  that's all the good stuff
[2456.56 --> 2457.22]  like all the
[2457.22 --> 2458.06]  the spices
[2458.06 --> 2458.88]  and the herbs
[2458.88 --> 2459.84]  to make the salad dressing
[2459.84 --> 2460.22]  tasty
[2460.22 --> 2461.22]  so
[2461.22 --> 2462.68]  here's what I think
[2462.68 --> 2464.42]  we're all like
[2464.42 --> 2465.72]  this top part
[2465.72 --> 2467.58]  of the salad dressing
[2467.58 --> 2469.12]  everyone looks at us
[2469.12 --> 2469.88]  but they can't see
[2469.88 --> 2470.94]  what's deep inside us
[2470.94 --> 2471.18]  right
[2471.18 --> 2472.94]  but all of us
[2472.94 --> 2473.64]  have something
[2473.64 --> 2474.78]  deep inside of us
[2474.78 --> 2477.10]  and the thing is
[2477.10 --> 2478.76]  what comes out
[2478.76 --> 2480.32]  well sometimes
[2480.32 --> 2482.34]  whatever is in us
[2482.34 --> 2483.64]  will come to the surface
[2483.64 --> 2484.54]  so what happens
[2484.54 --> 2485.14]  if I shake this
[2485.14 --> 2485.64]  who wants to shake
[2485.64 --> 2486.42]  this really hard for me
[2486.42 --> 2487.62]  okay
[2487.62 --> 2488.86]  can you shake this up
[2488.86 --> 2489.26]  really good
[2489.26 --> 2491.26]  all right
[2491.26 --> 2491.82]  shake it hard
[2491.82 --> 2492.74]  shake shake shake shake
[2492.74 --> 2493.04]  shake
[2493.04 --> 2493.68]  upside down
[2493.68 --> 2494.74]  okay
[2494.74 --> 2496.38]  excellent
[2496.38 --> 2496.72]  see
[2496.72 --> 2497.40]  see what happened
[2497.40 --> 2498.50]  whatever
[2498.50 --> 2499.52]  what was in the bottom
[2499.52 --> 2501.08]  is now visible
[2501.08 --> 2501.58]  on the top
[2501.58 --> 2502.56]  everyone can see
[2502.56 --> 2503.64]  what is inside us
[2503.64 --> 2505.50]  yeah
[2505.50 --> 2507.12]  so whatever is inside us
[2507.12 --> 2507.58]  can come out
[2507.58 --> 2508.32]  so sometimes
[2508.32 --> 2509.28]  when we
[2509.28 --> 2511.44]  in the words we speak
[2511.44 --> 2513.68]  or the things that we do
[2513.68 --> 2514.62]  sometimes people
[2514.62 --> 2515.58]  can see
[2515.58 --> 2517.54]  what comes out
[2517.54 --> 2518.58]  and so the question is
[2518.58 --> 2520.02]  what what Jesus says
[2520.02 --> 2521.14]  is that we need Jesus
[2521.14 --> 2522.24]  deep inside of us
[2522.24 --> 2523.40]  in our hearts
[2523.40 --> 2525.30]  and it's when
[2525.30 --> 2526.54]  we we speak
[2526.54 --> 2527.42]  and we act
[2527.42 --> 2528.66]  and we do all these things
[2528.66 --> 2530.32]  and we get shooken up
[2530.32 --> 2531.36]  sometimes we get shaken up
[2531.36 --> 2531.56]  right
[2531.56 --> 2533.40]  maybe get angry
[2533.40 --> 2534.16]  with somebody
[2534.16 --> 2535.16]  but if you
[2535.16 --> 2536.14]  are patient
[2536.14 --> 2537.84]  or sometimes
[2537.84 --> 2540.80]  if things are going well
[2540.80 --> 2541.80]  and you praise God
[2541.80 --> 2542.50]  and thank him
[2542.50 --> 2543.86]  these things come to the top
[2543.86 --> 2544.84]  and people can see
[2544.84 --> 2545.98]  what's deep inside
[2545.98 --> 2547.12]  okay
[2547.12 --> 2548.08]  so
[2548.08 --> 2549.52]  Jesus wants
[2549.52 --> 2551.38]  us to trust in him
[2551.38 --> 2552.64]  and that he can be deep in us
[2552.64 --> 2553.60]  and that he will come out
[2553.60 --> 2554.18]  in our lives
[2554.18 --> 2555.60]  and people will be able to see it
[2555.60 --> 2556.28]  okay
[2556.28 --> 2558.32]  can you remember that
[2558.32 --> 2559.28]  awesome
[2559.28 --> 2560.18]  salad dressing
[2560.18 --> 2560.80]  Italian
[2560.80 --> 2561.68]  it works with Italian
[2561.68 --> 2562.68]  not other kinds
[2562.68 --> 2563.28]  okay
[2563.28 --> 2563.88]  let's pray
[2563.88 --> 2565.72]  father we thank you
[2565.72 --> 2566.46]  for the spirit
[2566.46 --> 2568.46]  that works the life of Jesus
[2568.46 --> 2569.64]  deep inside of us
[2569.64 --> 2571.26]  and lord we pray
[2571.26 --> 2572.38]  that even when
[2572.38 --> 2573.50]  we are shaken
[2573.50 --> 2574.40]  in all the ways
[2574.40 --> 2575.30]  we are in this world
[2575.30 --> 2576.46]  lord that you would come out
[2576.46 --> 2578.46]  and that we would glorify
[2578.46 --> 2579.44]  your name in our lives
[2579.44 --> 2581.06]  lord make us good trees
[2581.06 --> 2581.86]  that bear good fruit
[2581.86 --> 2582.54]  for your glory
[2582.54 --> 2583.76]  and we pray in Jesus name
[2583.76 --> 2584.50]  amen
[2584.50 --> 2586.50]  thank you for joining me
[2586.50 --> 2588.48]  you can go back to your seats
[2588.48 --> 2590.06]  or to your class
[2590.06 --> 2590.26]  or to your class
[2590.26 --> 2592.76]  o h mina
[2592.80 --> 2595.02]  thank you
[2595.02 --> 2595.38]  thank you
[2595.38 --> 2597.32]  i don't have a
[2597.32 --> 2598.24]  thank you
[2604.10 --> 2604.62]  a miss
[2604.62 --> 2609.30]  my name
[2609.30 --> 2610.16]  okay
[2611.36 --> 2612.26]  yeah
[2612.26 --> 2612.68]  okay
[2612.68 --> 2612.86]  yeah
[2612.86 --> 2614.10]  okay
[2614.10 --> 2614.36]  yeah
[2614.36 --> 2614.68]  okay
[2614.68 --> 2614.78]  yeah
[2614.78 --> 2615.32]  okay
[2615.32 --> 2615.56]  okay
[2615.56 --> 2615.62]  yeah
[2615.62 --> 2615.90]  yeah
[2615.90 --> 2616.12]  okay
[2616.12 --> 2616.16]  uh
[2616.16 --> 2627.48]  I'll be reading from Malachi 2 verses 1 through 9.
[2628.80 --> 2631.98]  And now you priests, this warning is for you.
[2632.46 --> 2638.00]  If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name, says the Lord Almighty,
[2638.44 --> 2642.14]  I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings.
[2642.14 --> 2648.08]  Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me.
[2648.98 --> 2651.58]  Because of you, I will rebuke your descendants.
[2652.50 --> 2659.56]  I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with them.
[2660.36 --> 2667.96]  And you will know that I have sent you this warning, so that my covenant with Levi may continue, says the Lord Almighty.
[2667.96 --> 2675.28]  My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him.
[2676.08 --> 2681.50]  This called for reverence, and he revered me, and stood in awe of my name.
[2682.54 --> 2688.08]  True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips.
[2688.08 --> 2693.88]  He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.
[2694.72 --> 2701.50]  For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty,
[2702.06 --> 2704.66]  and people seek instruction from his mouth.
[2705.40 --> 2710.62]  But you have turned from the way, and by your teaching have caused many to stumble.
[2711.30 --> 2715.44]  You have violated the covenant with Levi, says the Lord Almighty.
[2715.44 --> 2721.36]  So, I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people,
[2721.74 --> 2727.94]  because you have not followed my ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.
[2728.74 --> 2730.22]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2730.22 --> 2732.02]  Thank you, God.
[2745.44 --> 2754.40]  So, we've been in a sermon series in the Old Testament book of Malachi, and this is our third week.
[2754.70 --> 2756.68]  But before we look at it together, let's pray.
[2756.68 --> 2760.28]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[2761.44 --> 2765.74]  Bring your nourishing and reorienting word to us.
[2766.90 --> 2769.94]  For if you are with us, then nothing else matters.
[2771.00 --> 2774.14]  And if you are not with us, then nothing else matters.
[2775.44 --> 2778.84]  Open our hearts to hear what the Spirit is saying to the church.
[2779.00 --> 2780.14]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2780.46 --> 2780.74]  Amen.
[2780.74 --> 2785.94]  So, I want to ask you to use your imaginations.
[2786.24 --> 2788.42]  It is the first day of math class.
[2789.82 --> 2795.14]  You walk in, you grab a desk, you get out your pencil and paper,
[2795.60 --> 2798.60]  whatever you take your notes on, and you get ready for class to start,
[2798.66 --> 2801.30]  and everyone's sitting quietly ready for the teacher, right?
[2802.58 --> 2803.00]  Christy?
[2803.60 --> 2804.00]  No.
[2804.48 --> 2805.16]  Not usually.
[2805.16 --> 2806.86]  But anyway.
[2807.92 --> 2808.68]  So, you're ready.
[2808.78 --> 2810.36]  You're ready for math class.
[2811.14 --> 2815.16]  Your teacher comes in and makes a very strange announcement.
[2816.26 --> 2820.12]  They say, I've decided to do something different this year.
[2820.84 --> 2823.24]  I have been teaching math for a long time now,
[2823.44 --> 2828.06]  and it just seems like students these days, they just aren't interested in math anymore.
[2828.62 --> 2830.36]  My class size is shrinking.
[2830.36 --> 2836.30]  Students are finding it so challenging, which makes them feel bad about themselves.
[2837.02 --> 2839.00]  And it's just not as practical as it used to be.
[2839.10 --> 2839.86]  You know, we all have smartphones.
[2840.06 --> 2845.06]  We can do all kinds of math calculations on our phones in our pockets.
[2846.74 --> 2851.76]  So, the teacher says, I've decided we're not going to do the assigned curriculum anymore.
[2852.48 --> 2857.98]  And I've noticed that what young people are really into these days is Klingon math.
[2857.98 --> 2862.60]  So, instead of the assigned curriculum, we're going to study Klingon math.
[2863.36 --> 2864.16]  But don't worry.
[2864.74 --> 2866.06]  Everyone will get an A.
[2866.26 --> 2868.16]  There will be no tests and no quizzes.
[2869.36 --> 2873.46]  And from there, the teacher launches into a whole term of Klingon math.
[2874.54 --> 2877.80]  And at first, you, as a student, are really excited about this, right?
[2877.86 --> 2878.38]  This is new.
[2878.48 --> 2879.16]  This is interesting.
[2879.82 --> 2882.04]  And no matter what, I'm going to get an A.
[2882.14 --> 2884.00]  So, you're pretty happy about this class.
[2884.90 --> 2887.02]  But the problems will crop up later.
[2887.02 --> 2895.50]  If you go on in math, your next teacher is going to expect that you have learned what you're supposed to be taught in the normal curriculum.
[2896.18 --> 2899.60]  Your next teacher doesn't care about Klingon math.
[2899.82 --> 2902.28]  So, your A grade is actually useless.
[2903.26 --> 2907.20]  It turns out your so-called math teacher wasn't helping you.
[2907.88 --> 2909.04]  They were hurting you.
[2909.60 --> 2913.18]  By not teaching the right things, they actually did you a disservice.
[2914.14 --> 2915.36]  They have led you astray.
[2915.36 --> 2924.34]  And today's text is not about wayward math teachers, but it's about wayward spiritual leaders.
[2924.34 --> 2929.04]  They were not doing what they're supposed to be doing.
[2929.68 --> 2932.96]  They were not teaching the things that they were supposed to teach.
[2933.38 --> 2936.18]  The priests in Malachi's day had done their own thing.
[2936.42 --> 2938.32]  They had gone their own way.
[2938.92 --> 2941.36]  And they were leading the people astray.
[2941.46 --> 2944.08]  And they were harming the people because of it.
[2944.08 --> 2947.60]  And the stakes are higher than math.
[2948.24 --> 2955.22]  As important as math is, the stakes are much higher because the stakes are eternal.
[2956.16 --> 2958.40]  And the priests were failing.
[2959.52 --> 2963.44]  And so, as we look at today's passage, there are three things I want to point our attention to.
[2963.44 --> 2970.16]  First, Malachi talks about the priestly covenant that he made with the tribe of Levi.
[2971.02 --> 2974.72]  And then he talks about how in his day, the priesthood had become corrupted.
[2975.26 --> 2979.92]  And then that will lead us to the true priest that we all need.
[2980.74 --> 2982.22]  So, first, the priestly covenant.
[2983.22 --> 2987.10]  And the chapter opens, chapter 2, verse 1, with this.
[2987.10 --> 2993.24]  It says, now, you priests, this warning is for you.
[2994.10 --> 3001.94]  So, here in verse 1, Malachi is signaling that the mess that he was confronting in chapter 1 is continuing into chapter 2.
[3002.90 --> 3007.60]  Chapter 1, as we looked at last week, was all about the people's worship.
[3007.84 --> 3010.96]  They were bringing subpar sacrifices.
[3011.74 --> 3014.86]  Lame, blind, and sick animals.
[3014.86 --> 3018.94]  As offerings, and it was offensive to God.
[3019.76 --> 3020.02]  Right?
[3020.10 --> 3023.10]  They weren't bringing their best to God.
[3023.70 --> 3029.28]  They weren't bringing, you know, I thought of Lorna and Kenny's show-winning cow.
[3029.92 --> 3030.18]  Right?
[3030.22 --> 3032.84]  Not the beautiful, best-looking cow.
[3033.24 --> 3037.04]  They were giving, as we mentioned last week, Gruffy the one-eyed goat.
[3038.24 --> 3044.04]  And a big part of the problem that was happening is that the priests were allowing it.
[3044.86 --> 3053.42]  And so, now, in chapter 2, the interrogation light shifts from the people of Judah, and it turns right directly onto the priests.
[3054.24 --> 3058.76]  Malachi now says, I have a warning specifically for the priests.
[3059.62 --> 3061.58]  So, now, let's look down in verse 4.
[3061.58 --> 3068.50]  Verse 4, God reminds the priests, he has made a covenant with Levi.
[3069.62 --> 3078.58]  So, he says, and you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue, says the Lord Almighty.
[3078.68 --> 3080.38]  God wants his covenant to continue.
[3080.52 --> 3084.30]  So, he's warning the priests to return to him, to return to their duty.
[3084.30 --> 3089.46]  And so, God is referring to this covenant with Levi that he has made with them.
[3089.52 --> 3090.44]  So, what is that all about?
[3091.20 --> 3095.36]  Well, Levi was one of the 12 sons of Jacob.
[3095.98 --> 3100.28]  And eventually, he became the head of one of the 12 tribes of Jacob.
[3100.90 --> 3109.60]  And at a certain point in their history, God has set apart the tribe of Levi to serve him as priests, to be the priests of Israel.
[3109.60 --> 3111.78]  And we read about this in Numbers 25.
[3112.00 --> 3116.42]  I want to share a bit of this passage, Numbers 25.
[3117.88 --> 3118.80]  Let's take a look.
[3119.92 --> 3129.32]  The Lord said to Moses, Phinehas, son of Elzar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites.
[3129.64 --> 3136.84]  Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal.
[3136.84 --> 3141.18]  Okay, so Phinehas had interceded and had defended God's honor.
[3142.12 --> 3146.18]  So, therefore, tell him, I am making my covenant of peace with him.
[3146.86 --> 3152.42]  He and his descendants will have a covenant of lasting priesthood.
[3152.80 --> 3158.60]  Because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.
[3160.22 --> 3163.66]  Okay, so that's what is this whole covenant with Levi about?
[3163.66 --> 3169.12]  How it's basically that the tribe of Levi was set apart as priests.
[3169.78 --> 3172.62]  Because they were zealous for God's honor.
[3173.30 --> 3176.72]  And that's what Malachi is talking about here in our text.
[3177.34 --> 3178.64]  And so now look at verse 5.
[3179.72 --> 3182.66]  He says, my covenant was with him.
[3183.02 --> 3186.50]  Levi, and so when we say Levi, refers to the whole Levitical tribe.
[3186.60 --> 3188.40]  Like Judah refers to all the people of Judah.
[3188.80 --> 3190.24]  Levi, all of the Levites.
[3190.24 --> 3195.50]  My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace.
[3195.72 --> 3197.56]  And I gave them to him.
[3197.64 --> 3199.24]  This called for reverence.
[3199.90 --> 3203.02]  And he revered me and he stood in awe of my name.
[3206.06 --> 3210.98]  So the first thing that Malachi does as he's starting to talk about the priests
[3210.98 --> 3216.00]  is he looks into the inner life of the priests.
[3216.00 --> 3222.56]  Before he talks all about what the priests do, he looks into their inner life, who they are.
[3222.80 --> 3225.92]  And he says, the priests revered me.
[3226.42 --> 3228.92]  And they stood in awe of me.
[3229.80 --> 3232.70]  So here's what it means to revere the Lord.
[3234.08 --> 3238.24]  It's when Jesus becomes the center of gravity.
[3238.24 --> 3244.12]  And I think this is what Jesus is getting at when he says no one can serve two masters.
[3244.98 --> 3248.06]  He says either you will hate the one and love the other,
[3248.40 --> 3251.24]  or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[3251.88 --> 3258.02]  And he means that you can only set one thing at the true center of your gravity,
[3258.28 --> 3264.48]  which everything else necessarily will have to orbit around.
[3264.48 --> 3264.80]  Right?
[3266.06 --> 3274.36]  The Levites had definitively welcomed God into that sacred space, right?
[3274.44 --> 3276.64]  To be the center of gravity.
[3277.70 --> 3281.28]  I love how A.W. Tozer speaks of it in his book, The Pursuit of God.
[3281.70 --> 3282.84]  This is what he says.
[3283.34 --> 3287.66]  So he's kind of here talking about before the fall in God's original creation.
[3288.14 --> 3288.50]  He says,
[3288.50 --> 3294.78]  In the deep heart of the man was a shrine where none but God was worthy to come.
[3295.84 --> 3300.52]  Our woes began when God was forced out of his central shrine,
[3301.28 --> 3306.98]  and things, all that God had made, all these good gifts from God, were allowed to enter.
[3307.74 --> 3311.82]  Within the human heart, things have taken over.
[3311.82 --> 3319.00]  Men have now by nature no peace within their hearts, for God is crowned there no longer.
[3319.88 --> 3327.26]  This is not a mere metaphor, but an accurate analysis of our true, our real spiritual trouble.
[3328.64 --> 3335.90]  So what A.W. Tozer is saying is that in each and every one of us, there is a war going on.
[3335.90 --> 3341.48]  And the war is, who is going to be center stage?
[3342.26 --> 3345.04]  What is going to be my all in all?
[3345.92 --> 3351.36]  What is going to sit on the throne of my heart and everything else is subjugated to it?
[3352.48 --> 3357.78]  And it begs the question for each one of us, what have we placed at the center of our hearts?
[3358.54 --> 3363.78]  What has gravitational pull such that everything else has to revolve around it?
[3363.78 --> 3367.68]  For the Levites, it was God.
[3368.44 --> 3372.90]  God was at the center of gravity for the Levites, the priests.
[3373.50 --> 3375.22]  They stood in awe of God.
[3375.30 --> 3376.68]  They defended God's honor.
[3377.44 --> 3380.00]  That's who they were deep down in their inner life.
[3380.94 --> 3383.36]  And then it talks about what the priest's role was.
[3383.46 --> 3388.34]  What exactly did the priest do as an overflow of what was deep in them?
[3388.92 --> 3391.34]  So look at verses 6 and 7 in our passage.
[3391.34 --> 3395.04]  True instruction was in his mouth.
[3395.94 --> 3398.42]  Nothing false was found on his lips.
[3399.00 --> 3399.92]  And then in verse 7,
[3400.50 --> 3403.50]  For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge,
[3403.66 --> 3406.00]  because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty,
[3406.26 --> 3408.76]  and people seek instruction from his mouth.
[3409.82 --> 3411.86]  You know, when we think about priests,
[3411.96 --> 3415.30]  often what we mainly think of is that they offered sacrifices.
[3415.48 --> 3416.10]  And that's true.
[3416.18 --> 3417.40]  That's what we talked about last week.
[3417.40 --> 3421.30]  But one of the other main jobs of the Old Testament priests
[3421.30 --> 3422.90]  was to teach the people.
[3424.02 --> 3424.16]  Right?
[3424.24 --> 3426.90]  They were experts in the law of God.
[3426.96 --> 3428.90]  And we say law, you know, in our minds we think of,
[3429.04 --> 3430.34]  well, just, I mean, strict rules.
[3430.90 --> 3432.82]  And the law did include rules,
[3432.96 --> 3435.24]  but it's all of God's revelation to his people,
[3435.34 --> 3436.26]  all of the blessings,
[3436.68 --> 3437.80]  his covenant with them.
[3439.06 --> 3440.10]  And the priests,
[3440.56 --> 3443.14]  they were taught the word of God,
[3443.14 --> 3446.44]  and then they would explain and expound the word of God.
[3446.48 --> 3449.40]  So all the other members of the other tribes in every town,
[3449.52 --> 3450.82]  the Levites would be and go,
[3451.28 --> 3453.16]  and they would instruct the people.
[3453.54 --> 3454.86]  That's one of the main things they did.
[3455.36 --> 3456.44]  And for generations,
[3457.36 --> 3459.78]  God says the tribe of Levi,
[3460.24 --> 3461.94]  they did this job very well.
[3462.78 --> 3464.68]  They gave true instruction.
[3465.24 --> 3466.52]  They avoided error.
[3466.52 --> 3469.24]  Then again, in verse 6,
[3469.38 --> 3470.42]  God says also,
[3471.28 --> 3473.52]  He, Levi and Levites,
[3473.78 --> 3476.86]  walked with me in peace and righteousness
[3476.86 --> 3478.72]  and turned many away from sin.
[3479.66 --> 3482.50]  See, a priest's job was not merely to teach the word of God well,
[3482.92 --> 3483.98]  but to live it out.
[3485.04 --> 3487.10]  They were to teach with their lives,
[3487.34 --> 3489.20]  not just with their lips.
[3489.30 --> 3491.04]  And the Levites had done this well too.
[3491.80 --> 3494.34]  They had served God with peace and righteousness.
[3494.98 --> 3495.86]  They were trustworthy.
[3495.86 --> 3496.72]  They were good.
[3496.80 --> 3498.10]  They had integrity.
[3498.72 --> 3500.10]  They could be relied on.
[3501.24 --> 3502.06]  And God said,
[3503.04 --> 3504.54]  He used their words,
[3504.94 --> 3505.80]  their lives,
[3506.58 --> 3508.70]  to turn many away from sin.
[3510.48 --> 3513.52]  That's how the priests were supposed to work.
[3514.44 --> 3514.66]  Right?
[3514.72 --> 3517.92]  They're supposed to speak knowledge and wisdom as truth,
[3518.58 --> 3520.42]  as God's messengers.
[3520.66 --> 3522.56]  And the people were supposed to listen.
[3522.56 --> 3526.10]  They were to seek the priests for knowledge and wisdom,
[3526.20 --> 3527.22]  to know God's will.
[3528.34 --> 3529.38]  And they were to listen to them.
[3529.98 --> 3531.66]  This is how God designed this to work.
[3532.28 --> 3535.30]  So now what happened in Israel since these golden days
[3535.30 --> 3537.34]  when the priests were faithful to their duty?
[3538.10 --> 3539.54]  What's gone wrong?
[3539.54 --> 3543.04]  That question brings us to our second point this morning
[3543.04 --> 3545.36]  about what Malachi shows us,
[3545.58 --> 3546.88]  priestly corruption.
[3548.08 --> 3550.56]  So after Malachi reminds the priests of the covenant
[3550.56 --> 3552.00]  that he had made with them,
[3553.00 --> 3555.60]  that they had been faithful to for generations,
[3555.80 --> 3559.04]  he next moves on to show them their unfaithfulness,
[3559.26 --> 3561.42]  their corruption in his day.
[3561.42 --> 3565.72]  And verse 8 paints a very different picture
[3565.72 --> 3567.88]  of what was now going on in Israel.
[3568.50 --> 3569.06]  Okay, so remember,
[3569.18 --> 3569.64]  the priests,
[3569.78 --> 3572.54]  they were to speak rightly.
[3572.78 --> 3574.00]  They were to live rightly.
[3574.50 --> 3576.66]  So what does God accuse them of here?
[3577.06 --> 3577.98]  This is what he says.
[3579.18 --> 3580.34]  Verse 8, he says,
[3580.42 --> 3582.92]  but you have turned from the way,
[3583.98 --> 3584.96]  that's their life, right?
[3585.16 --> 3586.40]  And by your teaching,
[3586.68 --> 3588.14]  have caused many to stumble.
[3588.46 --> 3590.16]  You have violated the covenant with Levi,
[3590.16 --> 3591.30]  says the Lord Almighty.
[3592.04 --> 3593.10]  So here's what's gone wrong.
[3593.98 --> 3596.76]  They have turned away from living rightly,
[3597.18 --> 3599.32]  and their teaching has caused many to stumble.
[3599.98 --> 3600.14]  Right?
[3600.18 --> 3600.86]  He says, basically,
[3600.98 --> 3602.20]  you have failed in both things.
[3602.28 --> 3604.90]  You neither live rightly nor teach rightly.
[3605.84 --> 3608.10]  And we read last week in chapter 1
[3608.10 --> 3608.82]  that the people,
[3609.36 --> 3610.46]  to put it crassly,
[3611.00 --> 3613.70]  were bringing pathetic and crappy sacrifices
[3613.70 --> 3614.74]  to the temple.
[3615.36 --> 3616.92]  And then the priests,
[3616.92 --> 3619.96]  in this scandalous unfaithfulness,
[3620.16 --> 3623.34]  were co-conspirators in this.
[3624.26 --> 3626.32]  They were giving their stamps of approval
[3626.32 --> 3629.78]  to subpar sacrifices.
[3631.52 --> 3633.54]  And by giving that stamp of approval,
[3633.82 --> 3635.12]  they misled the people
[3635.12 --> 3637.32]  to believe that God was actually accepting
[3637.32 --> 3638.80]  of the sacrifice,
[3638.90 --> 3639.74]  which was not true.
[3640.88 --> 3641.82]  So Malachi says,
[3642.10 --> 3643.58]  you have not been teaching truth
[3643.58 --> 3645.88]  about what God actually requires.
[3645.88 --> 3649.64]  And if you remember from our text last week,
[3649.86 --> 3652.52]  the people thought that worshiping God
[3652.52 --> 3654.20]  was a huge burden.
[3655.18 --> 3655.38]  They,
[3656.32 --> 3657.90]  that this is a weariness,
[3658.56 --> 3660.86]  all of these requirements God has given us.
[3661.14 --> 3662.50]  They were rolling their eyes
[3662.50 --> 3665.24]  at having to bring a proper sacrifice to God.
[3665.66 --> 3669.28]  And instead of the Levites correcting the people,
[3669.28 --> 3671.88]  the priests changed the curriculum,
[3672.46 --> 3674.28]  and they were giving easy A's.
[3674.96 --> 3675.92]  They brought this,
[3676.38 --> 3677.34]  gruffy the one I'd go,
[3678.10 --> 3679.78]  and the priest said,
[3680.38 --> 3680.84]  A plus.
[3681.16 --> 3681.44]  Great.
[3681.90 --> 3682.36]  Acceptable.
[3683.34 --> 3684.54]  It wasn't challenging the people,
[3684.62 --> 3686.12]  it wasn't requiring anything from them,
[3686.34 --> 3687.54]  their worship was perfunctory,
[3688.10 --> 3689.54]  their hearts were far from God,
[3689.78 --> 3692.36]  and the priests were just letting it all slide.
[3692.36 --> 3695.04]  In other words,
[3695.32 --> 3696.74]  you've been teaching Klingon math.
[3697.56 --> 3698.82]  And instead of helping the people,
[3699.64 --> 3701.04]  making it easier for them,
[3701.08 --> 3702.70]  you've actually just led them astray.
[3703.88 --> 3705.92]  God is angry at the priests.
[3707.00 --> 3709.22]  Priests were to be people who told the truth,
[3709.28 --> 3710.42]  even when it was unpopular.
[3711.58 --> 3713.18]  They were to correct God's people
[3713.18 --> 3714.96]  when their lifestyles veered away
[3714.96 --> 3716.14]  from God's revealed will.
[3717.12 --> 3718.14]  They were to be people
[3718.14 --> 3720.02]  who lived out their lives with integrity,
[3720.02 --> 3722.84]  modeling the holiness of God in their lives.
[3723.02 --> 3723.96]  But according to Malachi,
[3725.08 --> 3727.18]  the priests had failed in this task
[3727.18 --> 3729.76]  in a dire and appalling ways.
[3731.24 --> 3733.28]  And to the priests who continued
[3733.28 --> 3736.20]  to teach wrongly and live wrongly,
[3736.46 --> 3738.40]  God says there is judgment.
[3739.44 --> 3741.80]  So now this is kind of the verse
[3741.80 --> 3742.84]  that may have caught our attention
[3742.84 --> 3744.62]  as it was read for us in verse 3.
[3745.10 --> 3746.18]  This is what God says.
[3746.18 --> 3748.78]  I will smear on your faces
[3748.78 --> 3752.58]  the dung from your festival sacrifices
[3752.58 --> 3754.86]  and you will be carried off with it.
[3756.00 --> 3756.52]  Wow.
[3758.28 --> 3759.98]  That sounds kind of harsh.
[3761.08 --> 3761.22]  Right?
[3761.30 --> 3763.22]  God is threatening to smear dung
[3763.22 --> 3765.30]  on the faces of the priests.
[3765.98 --> 3767.08]  What is that about?
[3767.34 --> 3768.42]  Is this some sort of like
[3768.42 --> 3769.92]  juvenile divine comeback
[3769.92 --> 3771.90]  like, you know, a kid might have
[3771.90 --> 3772.88]  with a friend he's angry at,
[3772.96 --> 3773.66]  like poo on you?
[3773.86 --> 3775.22]  Like, is this what God is saying
[3775.22 --> 3775.78]  to the priests?
[3775.78 --> 3778.48]  Not exactly.
[3779.70 --> 3780.64]  Yes, actually.
[3781.22 --> 3782.92]  But it's not just,
[3783.58 --> 3784.46]  it's meaningful.
[3785.06 --> 3786.80]  So the Hebrew word here,
[3787.02 --> 3789.64]  dung, actually refers to entrails.
[3789.80 --> 3791.20]  So this is like all the intestines,
[3791.68 --> 3792.56]  the inner parts,
[3792.64 --> 3794.60]  the unclean parts of the animal.
[3795.08 --> 3796.38]  So the idea is this.
[3796.76 --> 3798.62]  People would bring an animal for sacrifice.
[3799.16 --> 3800.54]  The animal would be killed.
[3800.54 --> 3802.24]  They would use many parts
[3802.24 --> 3803.72]  for the burnt offering.
[3804.18 --> 3806.10]  But all of the guts,
[3806.36 --> 3807.02]  the intestines,
[3807.72 --> 3808.84]  the entrails,
[3808.94 --> 3811.18]  it had the excrement in it still.
[3811.50 --> 3813.28]  All of this pile of gross stuff
[3813.28 --> 3814.68]  would be taken out of the temple,
[3815.34 --> 3816.60]  outside the city walls,
[3816.94 --> 3818.34]  and it would be burned.
[3819.14 --> 3820.02]  Not as an offering,
[3820.16 --> 3821.04]  but just to get rid of it,
[3821.10 --> 3821.56]  to bury it,
[3821.68 --> 3822.16]  they burned it
[3822.16 --> 3823.92]  because it was considered unclean.
[3823.98 --> 3825.42]  It was considered unfit
[3825.42 --> 3826.82]  for the presence of a holy God.
[3827.60 --> 3828.94]  So the significance is this.
[3829.18 --> 3830.46]  All of that unclean stuff
[3830.46 --> 3831.86]  from this polluted offerings,
[3832.36 --> 3833.08]  gruffy the goat,
[3833.96 --> 3834.94]  polluted offering,
[3835.62 --> 3836.64]  you're going to take all of that,
[3836.72 --> 3838.04]  that it was being offered to God,
[3838.08 --> 3838.54]  and God says,
[3838.66 --> 3840.50]  I am going to plaster it on your face.
[3842.16 --> 3842.60]  Why?
[3843.72 --> 3845.24]  This still seems kind of crazy.
[3846.46 --> 3847.70]  Such a punishment
[3847.70 --> 3848.86]  was representative
[3848.86 --> 3850.98]  of what they were doing to God.
[3851.54 --> 3853.88]  The priests were despising God,
[3854.50 --> 3856.16]  and now they will be despised.
[3857.36 --> 3857.72]  Furthermore,
[3857.94 --> 3858.42]  the priests,
[3858.52 --> 3859.40]  to perform their duties,
[3859.50 --> 3861.72]  they had to be ceremonially clean.
[3862.64 --> 3863.98]  So to be smeared
[3863.98 --> 3865.68]  with the entrails of a dead animal
[3865.68 --> 3867.52]  would mean they can't perform
[3867.52 --> 3868.74]  their priestly duties.
[3869.10 --> 3870.98]  They would be ceremonially unclean
[3870.98 --> 3871.82]  for several days.
[3872.62 --> 3874.36]  And so it's not just gross
[3874.36 --> 3875.30]  and humiliating.
[3876.04 --> 3877.06]  God is saying,
[3877.96 --> 3879.18]  I am taking you out.
[3880.80 --> 3883.44]  You're not going to be priests anymore.
[3883.44 --> 3886.66]  And where they put all of that refuse
[3886.66 --> 3888.54]  from the offerings outside the city,
[3888.68 --> 3890.20]  that is where you will go.
[3891.32 --> 3895.16]  The irony here is absolutely scathing.
[3896.12 --> 3897.84]  This is poetic justice.
[3898.36 --> 3899.18]  Like if you want an example
[3899.18 --> 3900.64]  of poetic justice in the Bible,
[3900.96 --> 3901.52]  this is it.
[3902.14 --> 3904.04]  The priests were going to get tossed out
[3904.04 --> 3906.44]  just like the entrails of their offerings.
[3906.44 --> 3908.04]  God,
[3908.28 --> 3909.74]  as we can tell,
[3910.28 --> 3912.10]  is profoundly upset
[3912.10 --> 3913.14]  with the priests.
[3913.80 --> 3915.94]  They were supposed to be Israel's teachers.
[3916.70 --> 3918.12]  God had made a covenant with them.
[3918.40 --> 3920.94]  He had bestowed all of his blessings on them,
[3920.94 --> 3923.74]  and then they led the people astray.
[3924.40 --> 3926.10]  They were supposed to lead them
[3926.10 --> 3927.28]  to return to God.
[3929.32 --> 3930.46]  What they have done
[3930.46 --> 3932.36]  was priestly malpractice.
[3933.04 --> 3933.78]  And God says,
[3934.04 --> 3934.98]  no more.
[3935.32 --> 3936.42]  I'm not having it anymore.
[3936.68 --> 3937.54]  I'm taking you out.
[3939.86 --> 3942.02]  So that leads us to part three.
[3942.36 --> 3943.42]  The third part this morning,
[3943.50 --> 3945.20]  which is the true priests we all need.
[3946.02 --> 3947.94]  God had made a covenant with the Levites
[3947.94 --> 3950.30]  to bless them as a priest of Israel.
[3950.30 --> 3952.16]  They have corrupted the covenant.
[3953.04 --> 3954.50]  They were bad priests.
[3954.86 --> 3956.06]  God is calling them out,
[3956.18 --> 3957.68]  and he's removing their blessings.
[3957.78 --> 3958.66]  That's what curse means.
[3958.74 --> 3959.16]  It means,
[3959.58 --> 3960.70]  it's not like an incantation.
[3960.76 --> 3962.78]  It just means he's removing the good.
[3962.90 --> 3964.28]  He's giving them bad.
[3964.36 --> 3966.14]  He's removing the blessings from their lives.
[3966.58 --> 3968.32]  That is, of being the priests.
[3969.60 --> 3969.96]  Now,
[3970.72 --> 3973.30]  if Malachi
[3973.30 --> 3976.26]  were standing right here today,
[3977.26 --> 3979.32]  what might he say?
[3981.16 --> 3982.24]  That's a question
[3982.24 --> 3983.34]  I think we have to ask,
[3983.78 --> 3985.16]  and it's a very frightening question.
[3986.16 --> 3987.84]  To be honest with you,
[3988.36 --> 3990.24]  more than I care to admit,
[3990.40 --> 3991.64]  I am inclined
[3991.64 --> 3993.92]  towards the same failures
[3993.92 --> 3995.98]  as the priests of Malachi's day.
[3997.38 --> 3997.60]  See,
[3997.72 --> 3998.80]  as a pastor,
[3998.92 --> 3999.44]  as a minister,
[4000.68 --> 4001.90]  kind of our modern day equivalent
[4001.90 --> 4002.58]  of the priests,
[4002.58 --> 4004.70]  I struggle with the temptation
[4004.70 --> 4007.02]  to minimize God's word,
[4007.60 --> 4009.38]  to water things down,
[4010.18 --> 4011.62]  to keep the peace,
[4012.34 --> 4013.78]  even when it cheapens grace.
[4014.74 --> 4016.36]  I'm tempted to skip over
[4016.36 --> 4017.38]  parts of God's word
[4017.38 --> 4018.88]  that people may not want to hear,
[4019.52 --> 4020.72]  rather than to convey
[4020.72 --> 4022.38]  the full counsel of God,
[4023.18 --> 4025.04]  however imperfectly I may do it.
[4025.04 --> 4027.98]  I struggle with the temptation
[4027.98 --> 4029.20]  to show partiality
[4029.20 --> 4030.54]  in whom I am trying to please.
[4031.90 --> 4033.22]  And I struggle against
[4033.22 --> 4034.84]  that sentimental form of love
[4034.84 --> 4035.84]  that likes to tell people
[4035.84 --> 4036.52]  they're okay,
[4037.36 --> 4038.18]  even when,
[4038.66 --> 4039.12]  actually,
[4039.26 --> 4040.68]  repentance is what's required.
[4041.66 --> 4043.30]  And I forget that real love
[4043.30 --> 4044.32]  must sometimes challenge.
[4045.90 --> 4047.18]  These are the dangers
[4047.18 --> 4049.32]  that always seem to be waiting
[4049.32 --> 4051.66]  to trip me up
[4051.66 --> 4053.82]  and to compromise my integrity
[4053.82 --> 4055.00]  as a minister.
[4055.88 --> 4056.84]  I am prone to forget
[4056.84 --> 4058.40]  that while I serve a congregation,
[4059.24 --> 4060.84]  ultimately I answer to God.
[4062.22 --> 4063.62]  And so pastors like myself
[4063.62 --> 4064.86]  and my colleagues,
[4065.28 --> 4066.98]  we need to take especially
[4066.98 --> 4068.62]  carefully the warning
[4068.62 --> 4069.76]  of Malachi to heart.
[4071.18 --> 4072.90]  But there remains a challenge
[4072.90 --> 4073.62]  in this passage,
[4073.74 --> 4074.54]  not just for me,
[4074.68 --> 4075.54]  but for all of us.
[4077.30 --> 4078.40]  In 1 Peter,
[4079.32 --> 4080.70]  2 verse 9,
[4081.14 --> 4081.92]  a beloved verse,
[4082.04 --> 4083.58]  the Apostle Paul writes to Christians
[4083.58 --> 4084.36]  and he says this,
[4085.10 --> 4086.60]  but you are a chosen people,
[4087.46 --> 4088.72]  a royal priesthood,
[4089.58 --> 4090.70]  a holy nation,
[4090.82 --> 4091.88]  God's special possession,
[4092.72 --> 4093.78]  that you may declare
[4093.78 --> 4094.74]  the praises of him
[4094.74 --> 4096.08]  who called you out of darkness
[4096.08 --> 4097.32]  into his wonderful light.
[4099.16 --> 4101.86]  You are the priesthood.
[4103.30 --> 4103.42]  Right?
[4103.54 --> 4105.08]  What in Malachi's day
[4105.08 --> 4106.20]  was the priesthood of God
[4106.20 --> 4107.38]  was to lead God's people
[4107.38 --> 4108.68]  in worship
[4108.68 --> 4110.18]  and to know the law,
[4110.56 --> 4111.84]  that now has become
[4111.84 --> 4112.92]  the church.
[4114.12 --> 4115.66]  The Reformation slogan
[4115.66 --> 4116.50]  goes like this,
[4116.90 --> 4118.10]  the priesthood of what?
[4119.24 --> 4120.52]  All believers.
[4121.94 --> 4122.92]  So in this sense,
[4123.10 --> 4124.42]  we all serve as priests.
[4125.00 --> 4126.06]  We serve as priests
[4126.06 --> 4126.70]  to each other.
[4127.34 --> 4127.64]  Right?
[4127.68 --> 4129.08]  We all have access to God.
[4129.80 --> 4130.66]  All of us
[4130.66 --> 4133.58]  have God speaking to us
[4133.58 --> 4135.32]  through his word.
[4135.32 --> 4137.04]  we can all minister
[4137.04 --> 4137.68]  to one another.
[4138.38 --> 4139.64]  And it's a beautiful picture.
[4140.40 --> 4140.54]  Right?
[4140.60 --> 4141.46]  Each and every Christian
[4141.46 --> 4142.62]  filled with the Holy Spirit,
[4143.02 --> 4144.32]  living out the word of God,
[4144.64 --> 4145.82]  speaking the word of God
[4145.82 --> 4146.66]  to one another.
[4147.44 --> 4147.70]  Right?
[4147.80 --> 4148.64]  In songs and hymns
[4148.64 --> 4149.48]  and spiritual songs,
[4149.60 --> 4150.56]  encouraging one another.
[4151.52 --> 4152.68]  And we love to quote
[4152.68 --> 4153.84]  1 Peter 2.9
[4153.84 --> 4154.78]  because of all these
[4154.78 --> 4155.92]  positive aspects
[4155.92 --> 4157.12]  for believers
[4157.12 --> 4159.08]  about being priests.
[4159.08 --> 4161.48]  But if that is
[4161.48 --> 4162.26]  the covenant God
[4162.26 --> 4163.60]  has made with all of us,
[4164.12 --> 4165.58]  we have all become
[4165.58 --> 4166.74]  corrupted priests.
[4167.80 --> 4168.94]  Just like the priests
[4168.94 --> 4169.70]  in Malachi's day,
[4169.80 --> 4170.58]  we have failed
[4170.58 --> 4172.16]  in our duties
[4172.16 --> 4172.86]  as priests.
[4173.40 --> 4175.06]  We speak God's truth
[4175.06 --> 4175.76]  sometimes,
[4175.84 --> 4176.44]  his instruction
[4176.44 --> 4177.62]  sometimes found
[4177.62 --> 4178.26]  on our lips,
[4178.58 --> 4179.60]  but other times
[4179.60 --> 4180.44]  we ignore parts
[4180.44 --> 4181.22]  that we don't like
[4181.22 --> 4182.08]  and we say things
[4182.08 --> 4183.18]  that lead people
[4183.18 --> 4184.70]  away from trusting in God.
[4185.84 --> 4186.78]  We should be living
[4186.78 --> 4187.64]  all the time
[4187.64 --> 4188.50]  according to the way
[4188.50 --> 4188.88]  of Jesus
[4188.88 --> 4189.60]  and our lives
[4189.60 --> 4190.22]  with integrity,
[4190.58 --> 4191.84]  but sometimes we don't.
[4192.46 --> 4193.88]  Sometimes by our lives
[4193.88 --> 4194.74]  we cause people
[4194.74 --> 4195.22]  to stumble.
[4196.84 --> 4197.48]  The downside
[4197.48 --> 4198.50]  of being priests
[4198.50 --> 4199.74]  is that the punishment
[4199.74 --> 4200.74]  for bad priests
[4200.74 --> 4202.60]  lies upon our heads.
[4203.46 --> 4204.60]  Because of our sin,
[4204.70 --> 4205.64]  we are unclean
[4205.64 --> 4206.78]  and we are unfit to serve.
[4207.82 --> 4208.60]  We are called
[4208.60 --> 4209.34]  to be priests.
[4209.94 --> 4211.34]  That's what 1 Peter says.
[4212.02 --> 4213.18]  But in the end,
[4213.50 --> 4214.66]  we make a mockery of it.
[4216.18 --> 4217.18]  The problem
[4217.18 --> 4218.38]  when you read Malachi 2
[4218.38 --> 4219.14]  is not that
[4219.14 --> 4219.92]  if we could just get
[4219.92 --> 4220.92]  a couple better priests
[4220.92 --> 4221.82]  then things would be fine.
[4222.30 --> 4223.46]  The problem is
[4223.46 --> 4224.40]  that there are
[4224.40 --> 4225.32]  no good priests.
[4226.34 --> 4226.48]  Right?
[4226.56 --> 4227.26]  No good priests.
[4227.34 --> 4228.40]  Not all the time.
[4228.70 --> 4229.78]  Not in every way.
[4231.22 --> 4231.98]  And that's why
[4231.98 --> 4233.08]  Malachi's purpose here
[4233.08 --> 4233.82]  is not only
[4233.82 --> 4235.48]  to point out our sin,
[4235.86 --> 4236.74]  but more so
[4236.74 --> 4237.62]  is to redirect
[4237.62 --> 4238.76]  our gaze
[4238.76 --> 4240.10]  to our Savior.
[4240.50 --> 4240.94]  To be like
[4240.94 --> 4241.56]  John the Baptist
[4241.56 --> 4242.32]  pointing
[4242.32 --> 4244.72]  not to himself
[4244.72 --> 4245.20]  but a way
[4245.20 --> 4245.76]  to look
[4245.76 --> 4246.82]  the Lamb of God.
[4247.98 --> 4248.22]  Right?
[4248.34 --> 4249.06]  No priest,
[4249.22 --> 4249.78]  no pastor
[4249.78 --> 4250.46]  ever
[4250.46 --> 4251.60]  has possessed
[4251.60 --> 4252.54]  in himself
[4252.54 --> 4253.30]  the integrity
[4253.30 --> 4256.12]  and holiness
[4256.12 --> 4257.64]  to approach God
[4257.64 --> 4259.32]  to mediate God's love
[4259.32 --> 4260.22]  and his presence
[4260.22 --> 4261.34]  to God's people
[4261.34 --> 4262.72]  on their own two feet.
[4263.56 --> 4264.62]  Not one
[4264.62 --> 4266.38]  except for
[4266.38 --> 4268.40]  except for one.
[4269.66 --> 4270.82]  The book of Hebrews
[4270.82 --> 4272.14]  in chapters 7 and 8
[4272.14 --> 4272.92]  tells about
[4272.92 --> 4274.36]  a perfect priest.
[4275.32 --> 4276.04]  A priest
[4276.04 --> 4277.72]  who is distinct
[4277.72 --> 4278.98]  from all other priests.
[4279.90 --> 4280.44]  This priest
[4280.44 --> 4281.20]  is one
[4281.20 --> 4282.84]  who at all times
[4282.84 --> 4283.96]  and in every way
[4283.96 --> 4285.24]  had God
[4285.24 --> 4286.08]  at the center
[4286.08 --> 4286.86]  of his gravity.
[4288.06 --> 4288.18]  Right?
[4288.24 --> 4288.82]  His desire
[4288.82 --> 4289.58]  was always
[4289.58 --> 4290.38]  to honor God.
[4291.46 --> 4292.50]  True instruction
[4292.50 --> 4293.30]  was always
[4293.30 --> 4294.22]  on his lips
[4294.22 --> 4295.60]  to lead
[4295.60 --> 4296.08]  messy,
[4296.22 --> 4296.52]  broken,
[4296.74 --> 4297.12]  sinful,
[4297.48 --> 4298.12]  wayward people
[4298.12 --> 4299.64]  to turn from their sin
[4299.64 --> 4300.02]  and repent
[4300.02 --> 4300.72]  and turn
[4300.72 --> 4301.68]  toward God.
[4302.60 --> 4303.52]  And this priest
[4303.52 --> 4304.64]  always walked
[4304.64 --> 4305.32]  with God
[4305.32 --> 4306.08]  in peace
[4306.08 --> 4307.30]  and in righteousness.
[4308.64 --> 4309.68]  And who is
[4309.68 --> 4310.46]  this priest?
[4312.08 --> 4313.64]  This great high priest
[4313.64 --> 4314.82]  is Jesus Christ.
[4316.26 --> 4317.50]  In God's judgment
[4317.50 --> 4318.82]  on bad priests,
[4319.70 --> 4320.96]  Jesus took upon himself.
[4322.10 --> 4323.10]  He was taken
[4323.10 --> 4323.90]  outside the city
[4323.90 --> 4325.66]  and on the cross
[4325.66 --> 4326.24]  he had
[4326.24 --> 4327.38]  the dung
[4327.38 --> 4329.04]  of our sin
[4329.04 --> 4330.22]  smeared on him.
[4330.72 --> 4332.18]  and he
[4332.18 --> 4333.70]  took that punishment,
[4333.86 --> 4334.76]  he took the curse
[4334.76 --> 4336.32]  so that God
[4336.32 --> 4337.60]  could look on us
[4337.60 --> 4339.18]  and call us
[4339.18 --> 4340.64]  a chosen people,
[4341.26 --> 4343.06]  a royal priesthood,
[4343.72 --> 4344.96]  a holy nation
[4344.96 --> 4346.28]  in God's
[4346.28 --> 4347.10]  special
[4347.10 --> 4348.20]  possession.
[4349.94 --> 4351.26]  Jesus is the true
[4351.26 --> 4352.26]  and he is the perfect
[4352.26 --> 4352.86]  high priest
[4352.86 --> 4354.92]  who reconciled us
[4354.92 --> 4356.14]  fully to God
[4356.14 --> 4357.22]  once and for all,
[4357.28 --> 4358.16]  all of the way.
[4358.16 --> 4361.94]  and he did this
[4361.94 --> 4363.60]  because he loves you.
[4364.60 --> 4365.38]  He loves us.
[4366.52 --> 4367.42]  And so that is
[4367.42 --> 4368.42]  what enables us
[4368.42 --> 4369.22]  now to then
[4369.22 --> 4370.76]  live out the rest
[4370.76 --> 4372.46]  of 1 Peter 2.9
[4372.46 --> 4373.36]  where he says
[4373.36 --> 4374.36]  that we can then
[4374.36 --> 4375.62]  declare with our lips,
[4375.72 --> 4376.54]  with our lives,
[4376.90 --> 4378.06]  the praises of him
[4378.06 --> 4379.14]  who called us
[4379.14 --> 4379.84]  out of darkness
[4379.84 --> 4381.20]  and into
[4381.20 --> 4382.92]  his wonderful light.
[4382.92 --> 4384.66]  Let's pray.
[4387.98 --> 4389.04]  Our Heavenly Father,
[4389.20 --> 4389.92]  we thank you
[4389.92 --> 4391.52]  that
[4391.52 --> 4392.46]  though
[4392.46 --> 4393.20]  imperfect
[4393.20 --> 4394.20]  as we are,
[4395.20 --> 4396.04]  you
[4396.04 --> 4397.38]  in your goodness,
[4398.38 --> 4399.88]  in your divine
[4399.88 --> 4400.34]  will
[4400.34 --> 4401.02]  and sovereignty
[4401.02 --> 4402.76]  have seen fit
[4402.76 --> 4403.66]  to call each one
[4403.66 --> 4403.98]  of us
[4403.98 --> 4404.78]  to be priests,
[4404.78 --> 4407.34]  to mediate
[4407.34 --> 4409.80]  your presence
[4409.80 --> 4410.40]  and your word
[4410.40 --> 4411.30]  to one another,
[4411.88 --> 4413.20]  to call one another
[4413.20 --> 4413.90]  to worship,
[4414.84 --> 4416.48]  to offer ourselves
[4416.48 --> 4417.94]  as living sacrifices
[4417.94 --> 4418.56]  to God
[4418.56 --> 4419.96]  and Lord,
[4420.04 --> 4420.50]  we thank you
[4420.50 --> 4421.34]  that we stand
[4421.34 --> 4423.58]  in the shadow
[4423.58 --> 4424.02]  of,
[4424.12 --> 4424.80]  upon the shoulders
[4424.80 --> 4425.08]  of,
[4425.38 --> 4428.16]  in Jesus Christ
[4428.16 --> 4428.78]  who is our
[4428.78 --> 4429.54]  great high priest
[4429.54 --> 4430.44]  who accomplished
[4430.44 --> 4430.98]  the covenant
[4430.98 --> 4431.92]  for us perfectly
[4431.92 --> 4433.90]  and who Lord
[4433.90 --> 4434.98]  when we are in him
[4434.98 --> 4435.96]  and he in us,
[4436.72 --> 4436.86]  Lord,
[4436.94 --> 4438.02]  we are your special,
[4438.54 --> 4439.50]  your chosen people.
[4439.92 --> 4440.84]  We belong to you,
[4440.94 --> 4441.74]  we are your possession
[4441.74 --> 4443.18]  and you call us
[4443.18 --> 4443.82]  to be a priesthood
[4443.82 --> 4444.82]  not only to one another
[4444.82 --> 4445.52]  but Lord,
[4445.62 --> 4446.60]  to this whole world
[4446.60 --> 4447.82]  to lead
[4447.82 --> 4448.48]  all
[4448.48 --> 4450.12]  people
[4450.12 --> 4451.46]  Lord,
[4451.52 --> 4451.96]  to know you
[4451.96 --> 4452.64]  and worship you.
[4453.30 --> 4453.40]  Lord,
[4453.46 --> 4454.48]  make us priests
[4454.48 --> 4456.52]  who live rightly,
[4457.24 --> 4458.06]  who speak rightly
[4458.06 --> 4459.70]  by your help
[4459.70 --> 4460.22]  and the power
[4460.22 --> 4460.76]  of your Holy Spirit.
[4460.86 --> 4461.26]  We pray
[4461.26 --> 4462.44]  in Jesus' name.
[4463.08 --> 4463.34]  Amen.
[4464.96 --> 4465.76]  Let's all stand
[4465.76 --> 4466.46]  and we'll sing
[4466.46 --> 4467.58]  our song of response.
[4467.86 --> 4468.44]  It is called
[4468.44 --> 4469.36]  Refiner's Fire.
[4469.54 --> 4469.88]  Let's sing.
[4491.26 --> 4501.08]  Let me be as gold
[4501.08 --> 4502.16]  and precious silver.
[4502.16 --> 4502.86]  Let me be as gold
[4502.86 --> 4506.36]  and precious silver.
[4506.36 --> 4507.36]  glorify my heart.
[4507.36 --> 4510.06]  Let me be as gold.
[4510.06 --> 4514.10]  Let me be as gold.
[4514.10 --> 4517.78]  Your glory
[4517.78 --> 4521.18]  find as gold.
[4521.18 --> 4533.92]  set a blood for you,
[4533.92 --> 4536.06]  set a blood for you,
[4536.06 --> 4536.88]  Lord.
[4536.88 --> 4539.10]  I choose to be
[4539.10 --> 4540.10]  Lord,
[4540.10 --> 4541.10]  Lord,
[4541.10 --> 4542.10]  Lord,
[4542.10 --> 4546.84]  set a blood for you,
[4546.84 --> 4548.24]  my master,
[4548.24 --> 4552.58]  ready to do your will.

[4737.86 --> 4740.16]  Let's pray
[4740.16 --> 4743.30]  Father
[4743.30 --> 4745.96]  We thank You

[4756.22 --> 4758.22]  To receive His grace
[4758.22 --> 4759.46]  So that we can
[4759.46 --> 4761.30]  Experience that love
[4761.30 --> 4762.94]  That You have for us
[4762.94 --> 4764.22]  And Lord

[4770.60 --> 4771.18]  Neighbors
[4771.18 --> 4771.54]  Lord

[4775.48 --> 4777.12]  Lord
[4777.12 --> 4777.88]  Maybe they
[4777.88 --> 4778.94]  Have heard of You
[4778.94 --> 4780.20]  And they know the gift of grace
[4780.20 --> 4780.80]  That You offer
[4780.80 --> 4782.52]  But just haven't had the ability
[4782.52 --> 4783.22]  To surrender
[4783.22 --> 4785.18]  And to receive it
[4785.18 --> 4787.14]  We ask that You would work
[4787.14 --> 4787.94]  In their hearts
[4787.94 --> 4789.80]  Allow them to know
[4789.80 --> 4791.54]  Your calling
[4791.54 --> 4793.14]  On their lives
[4793.14 --> 4796.40]  So Father
