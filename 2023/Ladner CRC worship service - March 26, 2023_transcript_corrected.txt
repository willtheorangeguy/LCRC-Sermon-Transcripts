[180.00 → 205.70] Good morning.
[205.70 → 206.78] Good morning.
[206.78 → 209.70] And welcome this morning to our service.
[209.70 → 214.52] I'm certainly blessed by your presence here and pray that each of us in turn can be a
[214.52 → 216.58] blessing to each other this morning.
[217.38 → 218.56] My name is Jake Iron.
[218.76 → 223.96] I'll be leading us through the liturgy portions of our service this morning before Pastor
[223.96 → 227.18] Jason leads us in exploring God's words.
[227.80 → 232.44] Really just one announcement I wanted to make this morning is really just drawing your attention
[232.44 → 237.00] to an item in the bulletin and that's the Stations of the Cross that you see sprinkled around
[237.00 → 237.74] the sanctuary.
[237.92 → 239.62] There's eight of them if I'm counting right.
[240.12 → 242.90] And I'm told there are eight different artists that contributed.
[243.16 → 248.12] So definitely something to spend a bit of time maybe after the service or if you have time
[248.12 → 254.58] during the week, the sanctuary will be open to have a little bit of contemplation at these
[254.58 → 260.34] different stations of the cross.
[260.34 → 268.16] We gather this morning to remember our call to do justice, to love kindness and to walk humbly
[268.16 → 270.14] with God.
[270.14 → 276.70] We bring with us the events of the week in the world and in our lives, trying to know
[276.70 → 281.34] how to be just and loving and humble in the midst of it all.
[281.34 → 288.78] We gather here and see those who are doing justice, who are kind beyond measure, who set the example
[288.78 → 290.78] for humility.
[290.78 → 297.66] With gratitude for living saints, with thankfulness for the purpose of faith, let us worship God.
[297.66 → 299.66] Please join me in prayer.
[299.66 → 300.66] Thank you.
[300.66 → 301.66] Thank you.
[301.66 → 302.66] Thank you.
[302.66 → 303.66] Thank you.
[303.66 → 304.66] Thank you.
[304.66 → 305.66] Thank you.
[305.66 → 309.70] Almighty God, how wonderful you are.
[309.70 → 313.28] Creation calls out in awe of your power.
[313.28 → 317.18] The universe shines with your glory and greatness.
[317.18 → 321.30] Almighty God, how majestic you are.
[321.30 → 325.70] Each atom and molecule carry a tiny part of your plan.
[325.70 → 329.18] Every microbe speaks of your breathtaking beauty.
[329.18 → 333.82] Almighty Father, how awesome you are.
[333.82 → 339.78] The mountain ranges reflect your heights and the gentle valleys your mercy.
[339.78 → 343.42] Almighty One, how creative you are.
[343.42 → 348.16] Each tree and flower are filled with your wonder and bounty.
[348.16 → 352.58] Each life resounds with intricacy and miracles.
[352.58 → 358.18] We lift our eyes to you, our wonderful, majestic, awesome God.
[358.18 → 359.18] Amen.
[359.18 → 362.82] And now is a good time to stand, greet those around you, and our praise team will lead us
[362.82 → 363.82] in four songs.
[363.82 → 365.82] And our praise team will lead us in four songs.
[365.82 → 366.82] Amen.
[366.82 → 367.82] Amen.
[367.82 → 368.82] Amen.

[371.52 → 372.30] Novel has to relate these to the crowd.
[372.30 → 373.72] Amen.
[373.72 → 375.10] Let's after all, none of our hearts are absolutely free.
[375.10 → 375.26] Amen.
[375.26 → 376.40] Now there are thoughts of that all you are scoring that are popped out on.
[376.40 → 377.06] And the next came this morning.
[377.06 → 378.36] Amen.
[378.36 → 379.50] Everyone where we are going to go.
[379.50 → 381.52] Grand VAC parallels are just fine with your part, and get one more confident we're hitting it.
[381.52 → 383.26] Some people are going to be waiting there to keep the matter here.
[383.26 → 384.26] That's fine.
[384.26 → 385.48] Do you have to be here?
[385.48 → 386.20] Do you?
[386.20 → 387.18] Also there are going to be here, too?
[387.18 → 388.38] The things that are going to be over, no matter we have to go there.
[388.38 → 389.32] It is a little bit west, and we have to consider that all.
[389.32 → 413.38] Come all you people, come praise your maker.
[413.38 → 418.60] Come all you people, come praise your maker.
[418.60 → 423.66] Come all you people, come praise your maker.

[504.60 → 520.60] Fitness and majesty, manhood and deity, in perfect harmony, the man who is God.
[520.60 → 536.60] Lord of eternity, dwell in humanity, in humility and washes our feet.
[536.60 → 545.60] O what a mystery, meekness and majesty.
[545.60 → 562.60] How thou never worship for His nature, God.
[562.60 → 578.60] Father's will obey us, perfect in innocence, yet learn to obey us to death on a cross.
[578.60 → 585.60] Suffering to give us life, conquering through sacrifice.
[585.60 → 593.60] And as we crucified, praise Father, forgive.
[593.60 → 603.60] O what a mystery, meekness and majesty.
[603.60 → 618.60] How thou never worship for His history.
[618.60 → 633.60] alone
[633.60 → 634.52] Appears
[636.18 → 639.44] Lord of Infinity
[639.44 → 643.90] To me so tenderly
[643.90 → 646.94] Lear's my humanity
[646.94 → 650.94] To the highest of his throne
[650.94 → 654.66] Oh how ad halls the well
[654.66 → 658.50] He blessed and majesty
[658.50 → 660.50] Oh
[688.50 → 690.50] Oh
[690.50 → 692.50] Oh
[692.50 → 694.50] Oh
[694.50 → 696.50] Oh
[696.50 → 698.50] Oh
[698.50 → 700.50] Oh
[700.50 → 704.50] Jesus
[704.50 → 706.50] Christ
[706.50 → 708.50] I think upon you sacrifice
[708.50 → 710.50] You became
[710.50 → 712.50] God made
[712.50 → 714.50] Poured up to death
[714.50 → 716.50] Many
[716.50 → 718.50] Times
[718.50 → 720.50] I wondered at your gift
[720.50 → 722.50] Of life
[722.50 → 726.50] And I'm in that place once again
[726.50 → 728.50] I'm in that
[728.50 → 732.50] Place once again
[732.50 → 734.50] Once again
[734.50 → 736.50] I looked upon the cross
[736.50 → 738.50] Where you died
[738.50 → 740.50] I'm humbled by your
[740.50 → 742.50] Mercy, and I'm broken
[742.50 → 744.50] Inside
[744.50 → 746.50] Once again
[746.50 → 748.50] I thank you
[748.50 → 750.50] Once again
[750.50 → 752.50] I know all my life
[752.50 → 754.50] Thank you
[754.50 → 758.50] Thank you for the cross
[758.50 → 760.50] Thank you
[760.50 → 762.50] For the cross
[762.50 → 764.50] Thank you for the cross
[764.50 → 766.50] My friend
[768.50 → 770.50] Thank you for the cross
[770.50 → 772.50] Thank you for the cross
[772.50 → 778.62] Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[779.74 → 784.50] Once again I look upon the prospering night.
[785.72 → 790.50] I'm humbled by your mercy and the broken inside.
[791.92 → 794.34] Once again I thank you.
[794.98 → 798.50] Once again I pour up my life.
[802.50 → 815.00] And sing my soul, my Saviour God to thee.
[816.38 → 824.50] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[824.50 → 833.40] And sing my soul, my Saviour God to thee.
[835.02 → 843.38] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[843.38 → 854.66] I thank thee that God is self-aspirating.
[855.20 → 862.38] Send him to die, I stand and take it in.
[862.38 → 872.38] That all the cross, my burden, have been buried.
[873.38 → 880.38] He lived and died to take away my sin.
[880.38 → 890.38] And sing my soul, my Saviour God to thee.
[890.38 → 900.38] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[900.38 → 908.38] And sing my soul, my Saviour God to thee.
[908.38 → 920.38] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[920.38 → 931.38] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[931.38 → 938.84] Every week as we worship together, we have the opportunity to admit to ourselves, to each
[938.84 → 943.84] other and to God, that we do not always live as we are called.
[943.84 → 950.84] In this time of confession, this time of opening our hearts, let us remember that God is merciful
[950.84 → 954.84] and just, eager to offer grace and love.
[954.84 → 956.84] Please join me in prayer.
[956.84 → 966.84] Gracious God, source of all life, Lord of mercy and grace, hear our prayer.
[967.84 → 970.84] We come before you in need of healing.
[970.84 → 973.84] The healing of our bodies and souls.
[973.84 → 976.84] The healing of our relationships.
[976.84 → 980.84] The healing of our pride and fear and apathy.
[980.84 → 983.84] We know that with you nothing is impossible.
[983.84 → 985.84] Not even, not our healing.
[985.84 → 988.84] Not even the restoration of the whole world.
[989.84 → 991.84] We pray that you will heal us.
[992.84 → 994.84] That you will heal our world.
[994.84 → 1001.84] That you will, so that we will be freed to serve and love and dream and be.
[1002.84 → 1003.84] As Christ calls us.
[1003.84 → 1004.84] Amen.
[1004.84 → 1012.84] Our assurance of pardon this morning is from Colossians 1, where the Apostle Paul writes,
[1012.84 → 1015.84] Brothers and sisters, be reassured.
[1015.84 → 1018.84] Your sins are not held against you.
[1018.84 → 1021.84] By the work of God in Christ you are forgiven.
[1021.84 → 1028.84] God has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,
[1028.84 → 1031.84] in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[1031.84 → 1034.84] Jesus Loves Me is our next song.
[1034.84 → 1041.84] And after that, all those involved in kids life, ages 3 through grade 5, I believe, are free to go to their classes.
[1041.84 → 1043.84] Holy Spirit!
[1043.84 → 1044.84] Holy Spirit!
[1045.22 → 1057.72] Jesus Loves Me Z eon
[1057.84 → 1060.84] Jesus Loves Me, because Jesus Loves Me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so,
[1060.84 → 1065.84] Little ones to him belong.
[1065.84 → 1070.48] They are weak, but He is strong
[1070.48 → 1074.48] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1074.48 → 1079.60] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1079.60 → 1084.12] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1084.12 → 1088.36] The Bible tells me so
[1088.36 → 1094.58] Jesus loves me, He who died
[1094.58 → 1099.30] Heaven's gift to open one
[1099.30 → 1104.04] He will wash away my sin
[1104.04 → 1108.98] Let His little child come in
[1108.98 → 1113.18] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1113.18 → 1118.30] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1118.30 → 1122.90] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1122.90 → 1128.78] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1128.78 → 1132.36] Jesus loves me, this I know
[1132.36 → 1137.24] Has He loved so long ago
[1137.24 → 1141.82] Take Him, children, on His feet
[1141.82 → 1146.82] Sing, let them down to me
[1146.82 → 1152.28] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1152.28 → 1156.28] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1156.28 → 1160.28] Yes, Jesus loves me
[1160.28 → 1165.42] The Bible tells me so
[1165.42 → 1194.64] I invite you to listen
[1195.42 → 1197.40] To what God is saying to Malachi
[1197.40 → 1200.86] At the back end of chapter 2
[1200.86 → 1204.14] And into the first five verses of chapter 3
[1204.14 → 1209.92] You have wearied the Lord with your words
[1209.92 → 1212.88] How have we wearied Him, you ask?
[1213.60 → 1218.02] By saying, all who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord
[1218.02 → 1220.46] And He is pleased with them
[1220.46 → 1223.88] Or, where is the God of justice?
[1223.88 → 1226.46] I will send my messenger
[1226.46 → 1228.66] I will send my messenger who will prepare the way before me
[1228.66 → 1231.26] Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking
[1231.26 → 1232.94] Will come to His temple
[1232.94 → 1235.74] Even the messenger of the covenant
[1235.74 → 1238.00] Whom you desire will come
[1238.00 → 1239.92] Says the Lord Almighty
[1239.92 → 1244.22] But who can endure the day of His coming?
[1244.88 → 1247.02] Who can stand when He appears?
[1247.02 → 1250.36] For He will be like a refiner's fire
[1250.36 → 1252.12] Or a launderer's soap
[1252.12 → 1254.70] He will sit as a refiner
[1254.70 → 1256.86] And purifier of silver
[1256.86 → 1260.28] He will purify the Levites
[1260.28 → 1263.12] And refine them like gold and silver
[1263.12 → 1265.80] Then the Lord will have men
[1265.80 → 1267.80] Who will bring offerings in righteousness
[1267.80 → 1271.02] And the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
[1271.02 → 1273.00] Will be acceptable to the Lord
[1273.00 → 1275.10] As in days gone by
[1275.10 → 1277.06] As in former years
[1277.06 → 1280.42] So I will come to put you on trial
[1280.42 → 1284.78] I will be quick to testify against those who do not fear me
[1284.78 → 1289.06] Sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers
[1289.06 → 1292.70] Against those who defraud labourers of their wages
[1292.70 → 1295.80] Who oppress the widows and the fatherless
[1295.80 → 1299.42] And deprive the foreigners among you of justice
[1299.42 → 1301.14] Says the Lord Almighty
[1301.14 → 1304.14] This is the word of the Lord
[1304.14 → 1306.24] Thanks be to God
[1306.24 → 1319.64] See Colin became a member last Sunday
[1319.64 → 1320.66] And we put him right to work
[1320.66 → 1324.36] So we have been in a series
[1324.36 → 1326.10] In the book of Malachi
[1326.10 → 1327.50] Over these last few weeks
[1327.50 → 1328.52] And if you are here
[1328.52 → 1331.08] Returning with us
[1331.08 → 1332.40] I want to say thank you
[1332.40 → 1336.70] Because Malachi has had some hard things
[1336.70 → 1337.96] To say to us
[1337.96 → 1340.00] And God is good
[1340.00 → 1344.36] To lovingly say some of these things
[1344.36 → 1346.06] To us that we need to hear
[1346.06 → 1346.98] As his people
[1346.98 → 1349.38] So in the book of Malachi
[1349.38 → 1351.90] God is continuously
[1351.90 → 1353.76] Fathering us
[1353.76 → 1356.46] We are kind of like a child
[1356.46 → 1359.74] Who has fallen and scraped their knee
[1359.74 → 1361.30] And has become infected
[1361.30 → 1364.70] And so he applies the balm of the gospel
[1364.70 → 1366.74] And he cleans out the infection
[1366.74 → 1369.20] And then he puts bandages on us
[1369.20 → 1372.48] So that healing can take place
[1372.48 → 1375.86] That is God's heart in these messages
[1375.86 → 1380.12] Even sometimes when they are hard and challenging to us
[1380.12 → 1383.66] And so this week we turn a bit of a corner in Malachi
[1383.66 → 1385.32] We get a glimpse
[1385.32 → 1388.76] Of how God is going to set things right
[1388.76 → 1389.88] With his people
[1389.88 → 1392.80] So before we get into the passage together
[1392.80 → 1394.78] Let's stop and let's pray
[1394.78 → 1396.10] For the Lord's presence
[1396.10 → 1397.02] And for his help
[1397.02 → 1399.00] Please pray with me
[1399.00 → 1402.62] Heavenly Father we do pray
[1402.62 → 1405.14] If it so pleases you
[1405.14 → 1409.18] Would you pour out the blessing of your Holy Spirit
[1409.18 → 1410.64] Upon us your people
[1410.64 → 1414.88] We pray that you would make the gospel clear to us in your word
[1414.88 → 1417.82] And would you give us receptive hearts
[1417.82 → 1420.20] That we might humble ourselves before you
[1420.20 → 1422.06] To the healing of our hearts
[1422.06 → 1424.52] And to the transformation of our lives
[1424.52 → 1426.56] We pray in Christ's name
[1426.56 → 1427.50] Amen
[1427.50 → 1430.94] So imagine with me
[1430.94 → 1433.18] That you are out driving
[1433.18 → 1436.50] Maybe you are driving on Stevenson Highway
[1436.50 → 1437.62] In Richmond let's say
[1437.62 → 1438.74] This is something I do
[1438.74 → 1439.92] Every, almost every day
[1439.92 → 1442.40] And imagine it's a
[1442.40 → 1443.88] It's a peaceful night
[1443.88 → 1445.56] It's beautiful
[1445.56 → 1446.98] Full moon
[1446.98 → 1447.92] Good weather
[1447.92 → 1449.56] All is calm
[1449.56 → 1451.46] And all of a sudden
[1451.46 → 1452.98] Some crazy driver
[1452.98 → 1454.46] Because we're in Richmond
[1454.46 → 1455.18] Let's say a Tesla
[1455.18 → 1457.86] Comes behind you
[1457.86 → 1459.58] Tailgates you
[1459.58 → 1461.72] And then goes flying past you
[1461.72 → 1462.92] Clearly speeding
[1462.92 → 1464.86] Driving dangerously
[1464.86 → 1467.68] And as you mutter to yourself
[1467.68 → 1469.52] About Richmond Tesla drivers
[1469.52 → 1470.88] All of a sudden
[1470.88 → 1472.02] In your rearview mirror
[1472.02 → 1474.88] You see red and blue flashing lights
[1474.88 → 1478.00] Now how do you feel at that moment?
[1478.90 → 1479.76] If you're like me
[1479.76 → 1481.34] I expect you feel a degree
[1481.34 → 1482.74] Of satisfaction
[1482.74 → 1484.06] And happiness
[1484.06 → 1485.12] Like good
[1485.12 → 1486.20] That Tesla driver
[1486.20 → 1487.50] Is getting what he deserves
[1487.50 → 1489.02] For speeding and driving
[1489.02 → 1489.76] So dangerously
[1489.76 → 1492.34] I hope it's a huge fine
[1492.34 → 1495.80] Now let's say for a moment though
[1495.80 → 1498.56] What if the flashing red and blue lights
[1498.56 → 1501.22] Don't speed past you
[1501.22 → 1502.72] Instead
[1502.72 → 1505.30] They settle in behind you
[1505.30 → 1507.20] And you get pulled over
[1507.20 → 1508.64] I mean
[1508.64 → 1510.10] I guess I was
[1510.10 → 1511.86] Speeding a little bit
[1511.86 → 1513.82] But what about that other guy?
[1513.94 → 1515.64] He was speeding more
[1515.64 → 1517.68] He was driving dangerously
[1517.68 → 1520.56] Now how do you feel now
[1520.56 → 1521.94] As the police officer
[1521.94 → 1523.02] Writes you
[1523.02 → 1524.18] A ticket?
[1526.24 → 1527.26] Well justice
[1527.26 → 1528.96] Always feels sweet
[1528.96 → 1529.98] Until
[1529.98 → 1531.28] We
[1531.28 → 1532.46] Get justice
[1532.46 → 1533.54] Right?
[1533.58 → 1535.52] We're happy to see wrongdoers punished
[1535.52 → 1536.80] Until
[1536.80 → 1539.14] It's actually our wrongdoing
[1539.14 → 1540.70] That gets punished
[1540.70 → 1543.10] See in our text today
[1543.10 → 1543.56] Israel
[1543.56 → 1544.92] Is looking around
[1544.92 → 1546.22] At the surrounding nations
[1546.22 → 1548.46] And all the people around them
[1548.46 → 1549.28] Are sinning
[1549.28 → 1551.12] And they are doing evil
[1551.12 → 1552.84] And Israel says
[1552.84 → 1553.36] God
[1553.36 → 1554.80] When are you going to bring
[1554.80 → 1555.68] Justice?
[1556.96 → 1558.34] Are you just going to let
[1558.34 → 1559.40] These evildoers
[1559.40 → 1560.22] Get away
[1560.22 → 1561.68] With their evildoing?
[1562.12 → 1563.62] When are you going to come
[1563.62 → 1564.96] And set everything right?
[1566.48 → 1568.06] But what they don't realize
[1568.06 → 1568.44] Is that
[1568.44 → 1569.78] If God shows up
[1569.78 → 1571.16] If he comes
[1571.16 → 1572.60] To punish evildoers
[1572.60 → 1573.50] It means
[1573.50 → 1574.78] It is going to include
[1574.78 → 1575.40] Them
[1575.40 → 1577.84] If red and blue lights
[1577.84 → 1578.34] Appear
[1578.34 → 1579.46] On the scene
[1579.46 → 1580.38] In Malachi's day
[1580.38 → 1581.40] It's Israel
[1581.40 → 1582.34] Who is going to get
[1582.34 → 1582.84] Pulled over
[1582.84 → 1583.92] And get a ticket
[1583.92 → 1585.38] It's going to apply
[1585.38 → 1586.12] Just as much
[1586.12 → 1586.72] To Israel
[1586.72 → 1587.30] As it is
[1587.30 → 1588.18] To the other nations
[1588.18 → 1590.26] And so in our text today
[1590.26 → 1591.98] God is speaking
[1591.98 → 1592.86] To his people
[1592.86 → 1593.98] And he says
[1593.98 → 1594.90] Yes
[1594.90 → 1597.12] There is going to be
[1597.12 → 1597.66] A time
[1597.66 → 1599.24] When I show up
[1599.24 → 1600.44] And here is
[1600.44 → 1601.12] Here is what it is
[1601.12 → 1601.82] Going to be like
[1601.82 → 1603.78] And here is what
[1603.78 → 1604.72] Is going to happen
[1604.72 → 1606.50] When I come
[1606.50 → 1608.10] That is what this passage
[1608.10 → 1608.54] Is about
[1608.54 → 1609.16] So let's
[1609.16 → 1609.90] We are going to look
[1609.90 → 1611.02] At our text together
[1611.02 → 1611.98] In two sections
[1611.98 → 1612.50] This morning
[1612.50 → 1614.06] First we are going to see
[1614.06 → 1615.62] How God lovingly
[1615.62 → 1616.96] Reasons with us
[1616.96 → 1619.18] And then secondly
[1619.18 → 1620.72] We are just going to look
[1620.72 → 1622.22] At how God lovingly
[1622.22 → 1623.38] Refines us
[1623.38 → 1623.78] Okay
[1623.78 → 1624.54] Two simple points
[1624.54 → 1625.70] God lovingly
[1625.70 → 1626.78] He reasons with us
[1626.78 → 1628.58] And he refines us
[1628.58 → 1631.46] So let's look carefully
[1631.46 → 1632.30] At our passage
[1632.30 → 1632.84] This morning
[1632.84 → 1633.28] We will kind of
[1633.28 → 1634.22] Go right through it
[1634.22 → 1635.70] First God lovingly
[1635.70 → 1636.56] Reasons with us
[1636.56 → 1637.64] Starting in
[1637.64 → 1638.24] Our passage
[1638.24 → 1639.02] Chapter 2
[1639.02 → 1639.86] Verse 17
[1639.86 → 1641.38] God says
[1641.38 → 1642.74] Or Malachi
[1642.74 → 1644.00] God through Malachi
[1644.00 → 1644.48] The prophet
[1644.48 → 1645.64] He says to his people
[1645.64 → 1647.24] You have wearied
[1647.24 → 1647.88] The Lord
[1647.88 → 1649.80] With your words
[1649.80 → 1652.18] Now if you remember
[1652.18 → 1653.14] We've seen this word
[1653.14 → 1654.10] Weary before
[1654.10 → 1656.26] Back in chapter 1
[1656.26 → 1656.96] Verse 13
[1656.96 → 1658.16] Remember how Israel
[1658.16 → 1659.26] Says that they find
[1659.26 → 1660.06] The requirements
[1660.06 → 1661.88] To bring a proper
[1661.88 → 1663.32] Sacrifice to God
[1663.32 → 1663.96] In worship
[1663.96 → 1665.44] Wearying
[1665.44 → 1666.50] Right
[1666.50 → 1667.52] Worshipping God
[1667.52 → 1669.28] The way he has asked them
[1669.28 → 1671.08] Is a weariness
[1671.08 → 1671.98] To them
[1671.98 → 1672.86] God's people
[1672.86 → 1674.52] But now
[1674.52 → 1675.56] In our passage
[1675.56 → 1676.08] This morning
[1676.08 → 1676.78] God comes
[1676.78 → 1677.34] And he says
[1677.34 → 1679.14] I'm weary
[1679.14 → 1680.20] With you
[1680.20 → 1682.46] Now this is interesting
[1682.46 → 1684.96] God begins this text
[1684.96 → 1685.76] As it were
[1685.76 → 1687.56] By stooping down
[1687.56 → 1689.52] And being vulnerable
[1689.52 → 1690.56] With his people
[1690.56 → 1692.60] He's letting them know
[1692.60 → 1693.58] Just how
[1693.58 → 1695.04] Their attitudes
[1695.04 → 1696.16] Their heart
[1696.16 → 1696.90] Their actions
[1696.90 → 1697.96] Are affecting
[1697.96 → 1698.90] Him
[1698.90 → 1700.34] He's saying
[1700.34 → 1702.58] You have wearied
[1702.58 → 1703.28] Me
[1703.28 → 1706.84] What makes you feel weary
[1706.84 → 1709.68] If you have little kids
[1709.68 → 1710.16] At home
[1710.16 → 1712.52] Maybe you get wearied
[1712.52 → 1713.38] By taking care
[1713.38 → 1714.06] Of little kids
[1714.06 → 1715.54] You know
[1715.54 → 1716.82] Maybe if
[1716.82 → 1717.64] At work
[1717.64 → 1718.76] You are wearied
[1718.76 → 1719.92] By a co-worker
[1719.92 → 1721.26] That you have to deal with
[1721.26 → 1723.74] Some of you know
[1723.74 → 1724.26] What it's like
[1724.26 → 1725.36] To get in a conversation
[1725.36 → 1725.98] With people
[1725.98 → 1727.30] You don't agree with
[1727.30 → 1729.22] And you're just wearied
[1729.22 → 1730.18] By the arguing
[1730.18 → 1731.18] Back and forth
[1731.18 → 1732.10] And back and forth
[1732.10 → 1733.16] And it never seems
[1733.16 → 1734.34] To go anywhere
[1734.34 → 1735.64] It's exhausting
[1735.64 → 1738.28] Well in this passage
[1738.28 → 1739.84] God is wearied
[1739.84 → 1741.76] By Israel's words
[1741.76 → 1742.88] And this
[1742.88 → 1743.42] This verb
[1743.42 → 1744.10] Wearied
[1744.10 → 1745.18] Is in the perfect tense
[1745.18 → 1746.10] Which tells us
[1746.10 → 1747.28] That is something
[1747.28 → 1748.44] That's been happening
[1748.44 → 1750.22] Already for a while
[1750.22 → 1752.10] And has been building
[1752.10 → 1753.22] And building
[1753.22 → 1754.38] And now God
[1754.38 → 1756.72] Has finally had enough
[1756.72 → 1758.26] He is weary
[1758.26 → 1761.10] Nobody wants to hear
[1761.10 → 1762.58] God is wearied
[1762.58 → 1763.10] With you
[1763.10 → 1764.74] That's not something
[1764.74 → 1766.34] You want to hear
[1766.34 → 1768.90] But God comes to them
[1768.90 → 1770.10] And he tells them
[1770.10 → 1771.78] You have wearied me
[1771.78 → 1773.40] And he tells them
[1773.40 → 1774.74] That to invite them
[1774.74 → 1775.88] To return to him
[1775.88 → 1777.86] He's lovingly
[1777.86 → 1778.84] Reasoning with them
[1778.84 → 1779.98] As a father
[1779.98 → 1781.76] Would reason with his child
[1781.76 → 1783.62] So then
[1783.62 → 1784.26] God
[1784.26 → 1785.76] He opens up his heart
[1785.76 → 1786.10] He says
[1786.10 → 1787.30] This is how you're
[1787.30 → 1788.56] Making me feel here
[1788.56 → 1789.10] Kind of
[1789.10 → 1790.28] Relating to us
[1790.28 → 1790.84] On our level
[1790.84 → 1791.44] As humans
[1791.44 → 1794.12] Now what is Israel's response
[1794.12 → 1795.72] If we look again
[1795.72 → 1796.54] At verse 15
[1796.54 → 1797.54] You have wearied
[1797.54 → 1797.98] The Lord
[1797.98 → 1798.98] With your words
[1798.98 → 1800.84] How
[1800.84 → 1802.12] Have we wearied you
[1802.12 → 1803.74] You ask
[1803.74 → 1804.88] By saying
[1804.88 → 1806.24] All who do evil
[1806.24 → 1806.84] Are good
[1806.84 → 1807.46] In the eyes
[1807.46 → 1807.98] Of the Lord
[1807.98 → 1809.18] And he is pleased
[1809.18 → 1809.68] With them
[1809.68 → 1811.94] Now
[1811.94 → 1814.14] Are evildoers
[1814.14 → 1815.40] Good in the sight
[1815.40 → 1815.80] Of God
[1815.80 → 1817.86] No
[1817.86 → 1818.84] Right
[1818.84 → 1820.34] Is he pleased
[1820.34 → 1820.82] With them
[1820.82 → 1822.02] No
[1822.02 → 1823.86] Scriptures are clear
[1823.86 → 1824.28] About that
[1824.28 → 1824.90] God is not
[1824.90 → 1825.58] Pleased with evil
[1825.58 → 1825.88] Doers
[1825.88 → 1826.80] That's not true
[1826.80 → 1829.28] And in saying this
[1829.28 → 1830.46] I think they are
[1830.46 → 1831.50] Also implying
[1831.50 → 1832.34] The opposite
[1832.34 → 1833.76] They
[1833.76 → 1835.16] Consider themselves
[1835.16 → 1836.04] To be quite good
[1836.04 → 1837.82] And so they're saying
[1837.82 → 1839.18] We who do good
[1839.18 → 1839.98] Are evil
[1839.98 → 1840.78] In the sight
[1840.78 → 1841.30] Of God
[1841.30 → 1842.02] And he is not
[1842.02 → 1842.86] Pleased with us
[1842.86 → 1844.74] That's God
[1844.74 → 1845.52] That's the people's
[1845.52 → 1846.04] Attitude
[1846.04 → 1848.32] Also to God
[1848.32 → 1850.72] And they are making
[1850.72 → 1852.18] A huge accusation
[1852.18 → 1853.38] Against God's character
[1853.38 → 1854.66] Now
[1854.66 → 1855.52] Why
[1855.52 → 1857.04] Would they say this
[1857.04 → 1858.80] It's because
[1858.80 → 1860.16] The people of Israel
[1860.16 → 1860.92] At this point
[1860.92 → 1861.62] In their history
[1861.62 → 1862.96] Are looking around
[1862.96 → 1864.92] And they are seeing
[1864.92 → 1865.84] Evil people
[1865.84 → 1866.76] Prospering
[1866.76 → 1868.28] Evil people
[1868.28 → 1869.28] Succeeding
[1869.28 → 1870.02] Everywhere
[1870.02 → 1872.00] Right
[1872.00 → 1872.68] They've just gone
[1872.68 → 1873.48] Through the exile
[1873.48 → 1874.96] They've returned
[1874.96 → 1876.00] To the land of Judah
[1876.00 → 1877.68] But things are not
[1877.68 → 1878.38] Going well
[1878.38 → 1879.10] It seems like they
[1879.10 → 1879.92] God's people
[1879.92 → 1881.30] Are struggling
[1881.30 → 1881.80] Whereas
[1881.80 → 1883.58] All the other nations
[1883.58 → 1884.78] The people who worship
[1884.78 → 1885.88] Foreign gods
[1885.88 → 1888.04] Are doing just fine
[1888.04 → 1890.24] They're living under
[1890.24 → 1891.16] Persian rule
[1891.16 → 1892.70] And these Persians
[1892.70 → 1893.58] They are doing
[1893.58 → 1894.92] All sorts of wicked things
[1894.92 → 1895.58] And so the people
[1895.58 → 1896.02] Are saying
[1896.02 → 1897.22] If you look at the evidence
[1897.22 → 1898.56] It looks like God
[1898.56 → 1900.52] Does prefer wickedness
[1900.52 → 1902.50] And it also looks like
[1902.50 → 1903.74] God is being unfaithful
[1903.74 → 1904.40] To his people
[1904.40 → 1906.34] Now Israel is kind of
[1906.34 → 1906.84] Saying here
[1906.84 → 1907.96] God you haven't been
[1907.96 → 1908.80] Faithful to your
[1908.80 → 1909.54] Covenant promises
[1909.54 → 1911.48] You haven't blessed us
[1911.48 → 1912.20] In the way you said
[1912.20 → 1912.64] You would
[1912.64 → 1913.84] You haven't been
[1913.84 → 1914.76] Seeking justice
[1914.76 → 1915.78] And judgment
[1915.78 → 1916.88] On our behalf
[1916.88 → 1919.32] And then if you look
[1919.32 → 1920.24] Again at verse 17
[1920.24 → 1921.24] There's a second thing
[1921.24 → 1922.14] That people were saying
[1922.14 → 1922.90] They say
[1922.90 → 1923.94] Where is the God
[1923.94 → 1924.54] Of justice
[1924.54 → 1926.28] Or it could be
[1926.28 → 1926.74] Translated
[1926.74 → 1928.34] Where is the God
[1928.34 → 1929.80] Of judgment
[1929.80 → 1931.92] Where is the judgment
[1931.92 → 1933.08] God are you going
[1933.08 → 1933.76] To judge evil
[1933.76 → 1935.26] You know
[1935.26 → 1937.64] And over 15 times
[1937.64 → 1938.44] In the Psalms
[1938.44 → 1939.66] A psalmist
[1939.66 → 1940.58] Will come to God
[1940.58 → 1941.60] And the psalmist
[1941.60 → 1942.32] Will say to God
[1942.32 → 1943.84] How long
[1943.84 → 1944.50] Oh Lord
[1944.50 → 1946.82] And then he
[1946.82 → 1947.72] Expresses it
[1947.72 → 1948.56] In different ways
[1948.56 → 1950.18] Sometimes the psalmist
[1950.18 → 1950.72] Might say
[1950.72 → 1952.08] How long
[1952.08 → 1952.88] Oh Lord
[1952.88 → 1954.32] Are our enemies
[1954.32 → 1955.64] Going to oppress us
[1955.64 → 1957.52] How long
[1957.52 → 1958.12] Oh Lord
[1958.12 → 1959.24] Are evildoers
[1959.24 → 1959.94] Going to speak
[1959.94 → 1960.74] Against us
[1960.74 → 1961.74] How long
[1961.74 → 1962.16] Oh Lord
[1962.16 → 1962.92] Are your people
[1962.92 → 1963.74] Going to ignore
[1963.74 → 1964.42] Your word
[1964.42 → 1966.32] And it is
[1966.32 → 1967.40] Totally appropriate
[1967.40 → 1968.46] For them
[1968.46 → 1969.22] And for us
[1969.22 → 1970.70] To bring these
[1970.70 → 1971.34] Longings
[1971.34 → 1972.40] To the Lord
[1972.40 → 1972.96] He gives us
[1972.96 → 1973.50] These words
[1973.50 → 1974.02] To say
[1974.02 → 1976.50] He gives us
[1976.50 → 1977.10] Permission
[1977.10 → 1977.78] To bring our
[1977.78 → 1978.80] Longings to God
[1978.80 → 1980.80] For God
[1980.80 → 1982.00] To make things
[1982.00 → 1982.26] Right
[1982.26 → 1984.08] But apparently
[1984.08 → 1984.94] This was different
[1984.94 → 1986.24] Apparently
[1986.24 → 1987.28] Their longing
[1987.28 → 1988.90] Had corroded
[1988.90 → 1989.96] Into
[1989.96 → 1991.38] Cynicism
[1991.38 → 1992.70] And they just
[1992.70 → 1992.92] Thought
[1992.92 → 1993.40] You know what
[1993.40 → 1995.26] We can cry
[1995.26 → 1995.74] How long
[1995.74 → 1996.04] Oh Lord
[1996.04 → 1996.78] As much as we want
[1996.78 → 1997.18] But really
[1997.18 → 1997.84] God is out
[1997.84 → 1998.34] To lunch
[1998.34 → 2000.68] He doesn't
[2000.68 → 2001.20] He's not going
[2001.20 → 2002.04] To do what he said
[2002.04 → 2003.22] Where is the
[2003.22 → 2004.02] God of justice
[2004.02 → 2005.08] And that
[2005.08 → 2006.34] Grieved God
[2006.34 → 2008.08] That wearied him
[2008.08 → 2009.06] Hearing this
[2009.06 → 2009.64] From his people
[2009.64 → 2011.40] And so the beginning
[2011.40 → 2012.12] Of this passage
[2012.12 → 2013.14] He wants us to know
[2013.14 → 2013.92] That in these kinds
[2013.92 → 2014.58] Of attitudes
[2014.58 → 2016.66] It wearied his very heart
[2016.66 → 2019.56] But the beautiful thing
[2019.56 → 2020.74] About God
[2020.74 → 2021.60] In this passage
[2021.60 → 2023.54] Is that to his people
[2023.54 → 2024.68] Who are accusing him
[2024.68 → 2025.30] Of injustice
[2025.30 → 2027.52] God still answers
[2027.52 → 2029.54] He stoops down
[2029.54 → 2030.90] To reason with us
[2030.90 → 2032.64] He shows us his heart
[2032.64 → 2034.04] He invites us
[2034.04 → 2035.12] To come back to him
[2035.12 → 2037.78] And it's his fatherly love
[2037.78 → 2039.48] That would reason with us
[2039.48 → 2040.16] Like that
[2040.16 → 2041.64] When he could just
[2041.64 → 2042.88] Have obliterated us
[2042.88 → 2045.08] So that's the
[2045.08 → 2047.02] So first he reasons
[2047.02 → 2047.62] With us
[2047.62 → 2048.54] And then secondly
[2048.54 → 2049.24] The second thing
[2049.24 → 2049.90] We see here
[2049.90 → 2051.48] Is God lovingly
[2051.48 → 2052.42] Refines us
[2052.42 → 2054.80] The people are asking
[2054.80 → 2056.50] Where is the
[2056.50 → 2057.30] God of justice
[2057.30 → 2059.04] When will God come
[2059.04 → 2060.02] And bring judgment
[2060.02 → 2062.12] And God responds
[2062.12 → 2063.78] And he answers
[2063.78 → 2064.76] Their accusations
[2064.76 → 2065.56] In two ways
[2065.56 → 2066.52] First he says
[2066.52 → 2068.36] God is coming
[2068.36 → 2069.98] God is coming
[2069.98 → 2071.02] And second
[2071.02 → 2072.76] There will be judgment
[2072.76 → 2074.54] So first God says
[2074.54 → 2075.24] I am coming
[2075.24 → 2076.28] Look at verse
[2076.28 → 2077.68] Chapter 3 verse 1
[2077.68 → 2079.06] God says
[2079.06 → 2081.58] I will send my messenger
[2081.58 → 2083.76] Who will prepare the way
[2083.76 → 2085.00] Before me
[2085.00 → 2086.26] This is part of God's answer
[2086.26 → 2088.14] In this verse
[2088.14 → 2089.36] Malachi 3 verse 1
[2089.36 → 2089.94] Is quoted
[2089.94 → 2091.62] Three times
[2091.62 → 2092.96] In the New Testament
[2092.96 → 2094.44] Matthew 11
[2094.44 → 2095.48] Mark 1
[2095.48 → 2096.26] Luke 7
[2096.26 → 2097.80] And in each case
[2097.80 → 2098.38] It is Jesus
[2098.38 → 2099.30] Who is talking
[2099.30 → 2100.66] And he's saying
[2100.66 → 2101.30] The messenger
[2101.30 → 2102.90] That Malachi is talking about
[2102.90 → 2104.86] Is John the Baptist
[2104.86 → 2107.06] John was the messenger
[2107.06 → 2108.88] Preparing the way
[2108.88 → 2110.04] For Jesus
[2110.04 → 2111.90] So what does it mean
[2111.90 → 2112.70] For this messenger
[2112.70 → 2114.20] To prepare the way
[2114.20 → 2115.18] What does that look like?
[2115.92 → 2117.20] Well in ancient times
[2117.20 → 2119.06] When a king would visit
[2119.06 → 2120.24] Outlying provinces
[2120.24 → 2120.98] And cities
[2120.98 → 2122.48] They would send
[2122.48 → 2123.66] A messenger ahead
[2123.66 → 2124.90] And the messenger
[2124.90 → 2125.60] Would arrive
[2125.60 → 2126.36] Ahead of the king
[2126.36 → 2127.12] And the messenger
[2127.12 → 2127.78] Would say
[2127.78 → 2129.38] Get ready
[2129.38 → 2130.38] Because the king
[2130.38 → 2130.96] Is coming
[2130.96 → 2131.58] Right
[2131.58 → 2132.34] Make adequate
[2132.34 → 2133.12] Preparations
[2133.12 → 2134.36] Smooth out the road
[2134.36 → 2135.50] Make sure there's
[2135.50 → 2136.36] No bandits
[2136.36 → 2136.94] Who are going to
[2136.94 → 2137.62] Cause him trouble
[2137.62 → 2139.22] Make sure the
[2139.22 → 2139.92] Inn
[2139.92 → 2140.80] Is ready
[2140.80 → 2141.68] There's food
[2141.68 → 2142.84] Prepared
[2142.84 → 2144.50] Make adequate
[2144.50 → 2145.08] Preparations
[2145.08 → 2145.96] The king is coming
[2145.96 → 2147.46] And that is just
[2147.46 → 2148.18] What John the Baptist
[2148.18 → 2148.50] Did
[2148.50 → 2150.24] When John the Baptist
[2150.24 → 2150.98] Finally comes
[2150.98 → 2152.20] 400 years later
[2152.20 → 2153.14] After Malachi
[2153.14 → 2154.78] What was his message?
[2155.50 → 2156.16] If we look at
[2156.16 → 2157.74] Matthew chapter 3
[2157.74 → 2159.30] Verses 1 and 2
[2159.30 → 2160.96] It says this
[2160.96 → 2161.92] In those days
[2161.92 → 2162.72] John the Baptist
[2162.72 → 2163.22] Came
[2163.22 → 2165.02] Preaching in the wilderness
[2165.02 → 2165.68] Of Judah
[2165.68 → 2166.50] And saying
[2166.50 → 2167.90] Repent
[2167.90 → 2169.12] For the kingdom
[2169.12 → 2169.88] Of heaven
[2169.88 → 2171.30] Has come near
[2171.30 → 2173.30] Right?
[2173.42 → 2173.88] Repent
[2173.88 → 2175.28] That's how you
[2175.28 → 2175.68] How do you
[2175.68 → 2176.46] Prepare the way
[2176.46 → 2177.00] For the Lord?
[2177.34 → 2177.94] You repent
[2177.94 → 2178.72] You get ready
[2178.72 → 2179.82] The kingdom of God
[2179.82 → 2180.50] Is at hand
[2180.50 → 2181.62] You need to make
[2181.62 → 2182.28] Some changes
[2182.28 → 2184.08] Because God's
[2184.08 → 2184.68] On the way
[2184.68 → 2186.92] So first God says
[2186.92 → 2187.40] He will send
[2187.40 → 2187.94] His messenger
[2187.94 → 2189.02] To get the people
[2189.02 → 2189.86] Ready for his coming
[2189.86 → 2191.08] And then the second
[2191.08 → 2192.14] Thing he says here
[2192.14 → 2193.34] In Malachi chapter 3
[2193.34 → 2193.88] Verse 1
[2193.88 → 2195.26] Is that God
[2195.26 → 2195.96] Promises
[2195.96 → 2197.20] To come
[2197.20 → 2198.22] Himself
[2198.22 → 2200.06] It says
[2200.06 → 2201.06] Then suddenly
[2201.06 → 2202.32] The Lord
[2202.32 → 2203.48] You are seeking
[2203.48 → 2203.98] Right?
[2204.04 → 2204.92] This Lord you're saying
[2204.92 → 2206.34] Where are you?
[2207.12 → 2207.98] Will you come
[2207.98 → 2208.46] In judgment
[2208.46 → 2210.74] This Lord you are seeking
[2210.74 → 2212.26] He will come
[2212.26 → 2213.04] To his temple
[2213.04 → 2214.36] The messenger
[2214.36 → 2215.32] Of the covenant
[2215.32 → 2217.04] Whom you desire
[2217.04 → 2218.54] Will come
[2218.54 → 2219.82] Says the Lord
[2219.82 → 2220.42] Almighty
[2220.42 → 2221.78] And friends
[2221.78 → 2223.32] This is an astonishing
[2223.32 → 2223.88] Promise
[2223.88 → 2224.32] Right?
[2224.56 → 2225.22] It's one thing
[2225.22 → 2225.88] For God to
[2225.88 → 2226.66] To send all
[2226.66 → 2227.42] Of these messengers
[2227.42 → 2227.92] In fact
[2227.92 → 2228.58] That is what God
[2228.58 → 2229.04] Has been doing
[2229.04 → 2229.96] For hundreds of years
[2229.96 → 2231.00] He has sent
[2231.00 → 2232.18] All the prophets
[2232.18 → 2233.40] Isaiah
[2233.40 → 2234.08] Jeremiah
[2234.08 → 2235.22] Ezekiel
[2235.22 → 2236.02] Hosea
[2236.02 → 2236.26] Joel
[2236.26 → 2236.64] Amos
[2236.64 → 2237.06] Obadiah
[2237.06 → 2237.28] Jonah
[2237.28 → 2237.74] Micah
[2237.74 → 2239.72] All the prophets
[2239.72 → 2240.48] He sent them
[2240.48 → 2241.26] Malachi
[2241.26 → 2242.58] Whose name means
[2242.58 → 2243.52] My messenger
[2243.52 → 2245.14] He has sent Malachi
[2245.14 → 2247.30] He has sent John the Baptist
[2247.30 → 2249.00] He will send him
[2249.00 → 2251.80] And all of these messengers
[2251.80 → 2253.60] Were all of God's grace
[2253.60 → 2254.24] To his people
[2254.24 → 2255.46] To call them
[2255.46 → 2256.78] To return to the Lord
[2256.78 → 2258.08] Turn to God
[2258.08 → 2258.72] In your hearts
[2258.72 → 2259.48] And in your lives
[2259.48 → 2261.20] But now
[2261.20 → 2263.00] The truly incredible thing
[2263.00 → 2264.12] Is that God
[2264.12 → 2264.74] Is promising
[2264.74 → 2265.62] That you know
[2265.62 → 2266.54] I'm not going to send
[2266.54 → 2267.40] Any more messengers
[2267.40 → 2269.06] I am going to
[2269.06 → 2269.48] Come
[2269.48 → 2270.44] Myself
[2270.44 → 2273.72] So that's the first part
[2273.72 → 2274.68] Of God's response
[2274.68 → 2275.74] Where is the God
[2275.74 → 2276.32] Of justice
[2276.32 → 2277.38] God says
[2277.38 → 2278.52] I am coming
[2278.52 → 2280.58] And then the second part
[2280.58 → 2281.60] Of the response is
[2281.60 → 2283.02] And there
[2283.02 → 2284.34] Will be
[2284.34 → 2284.92] Judgment
[2284.92 → 2287.12] So look down
[2287.12 → 2288.52] Moving on
[2288.52 → 2289.40] To verse 2
[2289.40 → 2292.70] But who can endure
[2292.70 → 2293.68] The day
[2293.68 → 2295.18] Of his coming
[2295.18 → 2296.78] So Malachi
[2296.78 → 2297.64] Talks here
[2297.64 → 2298.64] About the day
[2298.64 → 2299.64] Of the Lord's coming
[2299.64 → 2301.58] Which is synonymous
[2301.58 → 2302.14] With
[2302.14 → 2303.70] The day of the Lord
[2303.70 → 2304.24] Or
[2304.24 → 2306.18] The day of judgment
[2306.18 → 2308.16] See God's people
[2308.16 → 2309.26] Were anticipating
[2309.26 → 2310.22] This day
[2310.22 → 2311.70] And they hoped
[2311.70 → 2312.40] What do they hope for?
[2312.48 → 2313.66] They hope that on this day
[2313.66 → 2315.20] God will come
[2315.20 → 2316.68] And he will pull over
[2316.68 → 2318.22] All the evil cars
[2318.22 → 2319.14] Who are speeding
[2319.14 → 2320.26] So much faster
[2320.26 → 2320.84] Than they are
[2320.84 → 2323.20] They were longing
[2323.20 → 2325.44] For a geopolitical conquest
[2325.44 → 2326.92] Where finally
[2326.92 → 2327.68] The temple
[2327.68 → 2328.64] Would be
[2328.64 → 2330.18] Made more beautiful
[2330.18 → 2331.72] Israel
[2331.72 → 2332.98] Would flourish
[2332.98 → 2334.02] In the land
[2334.02 → 2336.34] All of Israel's enemies
[2336.34 → 2337.46] Would be kicked out
[2337.46 → 2338.60] And everything
[2338.60 → 2339.56] Would be all good
[2339.56 → 2341.76] That's what they longed for
[2341.76 → 2342.36] On this day
[2342.36 → 2344.24] So when Israel asks
[2344.24 → 2345.90] Where is the God of justice
[2345.90 → 2347.68] Surely this is
[2347.68 → 2349.06] The day
[2349.06 → 2350.64] That they have in mind
[2350.64 → 2352.80] When is this going to happen
[2352.80 → 2353.28] God?
[2354.54 → 2355.44] But Malachi
[2355.44 → 2356.76] Starts to paint
[2356.76 → 2358.24] A different picture
[2358.24 → 2359.82] Of what would happen
[2359.82 → 2361.06] When Messiah comes
[2361.06 → 2362.68] He says again
[2362.68 → 2363.38] In verse 2
[2363.38 → 2366.12] But who can endure
[2366.12 → 2367.66] The day of his coming?
[2367.66 → 2369.04] Who can stand
[2369.04 → 2370.62] When he appears?
[2371.44 → 2371.66] Right?
[2371.70 → 2372.64] When this day comes
[2372.64 → 2372.86] Right?
[2372.88 → 2374.64] When God removes that veil
[2374.64 → 2376.20] Between us and him
[2376.20 → 2377.16] And he brings
[2377.16 → 2378.12] The judgment
[2378.12 → 2378.90] He asks
[2378.90 → 2381.28] Who will stand?
[2382.36 → 2384.18] It's a rhetorical question
[2384.18 → 2385.86] The answer is
[2385.86 → 2388.10] No one
[2388.10 → 2390.28] No one
[2390.28 → 2391.84] Is going to remain
[2391.84 → 2393.06] No one
[2393.06 → 2394.40] Will stand
[2394.40 → 2395.58] Right?
[2395.90 → 2396.96] When God says
[2396.96 → 2397.84] When I come
[2397.84 → 2398.70] To judge
[2398.70 → 2399.98] It is not
[2399.98 → 2400.82] Going to go well
[2400.82 → 2401.20] With you
[2401.20 → 2402.90] When the day
[2402.90 → 2403.84] Of the Lord comes
[2403.84 → 2404.74] You my people
[2404.74 → 2406.18] Will not be able
[2406.18 → 2406.98] To endure it
[2406.98 → 2407.96] Right?
[2408.08 → 2408.46] Why?
[2408.62 → 2409.50] Because Israel
[2409.50 → 2410.68] They too
[2410.68 → 2411.98] Had been unfaithful
[2411.98 → 2413.16] That's the whole reason
[2413.16 → 2414.14] They went into exile
[2414.14 → 2416.44] They were unfaithful
[2416.44 → 2416.94] To God
[2416.94 → 2418.68] God is trying
[2418.68 → 2420.20] To wake them up
[2420.20 → 2421.44] To call them
[2421.44 → 2422.52] To return to the Lord
[2422.52 → 2424.00] And not only
[2424.00 → 2424.40] Israel
[2424.40 → 2425.32] But the entire
[2425.32 → 2426.44] World has been
[2426.44 → 2427.06] Unfaithful
[2427.06 → 2428.70] All have sinned
[2428.70 → 2429.42] And fallen short
[2429.42 → 2430.42] Of the glory of God
[2430.42 → 2431.40] And so Malachi
[2431.40 → 2432.08] Is clear
[2432.08 → 2433.30] If we try to go
[2433.30 → 2434.10] Through the fires
[2434.10 → 2434.90] Of God's judgment
[2434.90 → 2436.16] On our own two feet
[2436.16 → 2437.74] We will be consumed
[2437.74 → 2439.52] God says
[2439.52 → 2440.32] If I come
[2440.32 → 2442.08] In judgment
[2442.08 → 2443.54] And in justice
[2443.54 → 2445.24] Like you are asking me
[2445.24 → 2446.16] If I come
[2446.16 → 2448.06] Where is the God of justice?
[2448.32 → 2449.40] If I come in justice
[2449.40 → 2451.38] You will not stand
[2451.38 → 2453.66] And that means
[2453.66 → 2454.82] Something needs
[2454.82 → 2455.30] To be done
[2455.30 → 2457.64] Something unexpected
[2457.64 → 2458.66] Has to happen
[2458.66 → 2459.90] Before the day
[2459.90 → 2460.50] Of the Lord
[2460.50 → 2461.88] And that is what
[2461.88 → 2462.42] Happens
[2462.42 → 2463.56] When Jesus came
[2463.56 → 2464.92] You know
[2464.92 → 2465.48] Many of you
[2465.48 → 2466.24] Are probably familiar
[2466.24 → 2467.34] With John 3.16
[2467.34 → 2467.60] Right?
[2468.76 → 2469.60] For God
[2469.60 → 2471.74] So loved
[2471.74 → 2472.34] The world
[2472.34 → 2473.44] That he gave
[2473.44 → 2474.34] His one and only son
[2474.34 → 2474.76] That whoever
[2474.76 → 2475.56] Believes in him
[2475.56 → 2476.76] Shall not perish
[2476.76 → 2478.50] But have eternal life
[2478.50 → 2480.16] But then
[2480.16 → 2481.44] John 3.17
[2481.44 → 2482.56] It goes on
[2482.56 → 2483.28] And it says this
[2483.28 → 2484.38] For God did not
[2484.38 → 2484.98] Send his son
[2484.98 → 2485.70] Into the world
[2485.70 → 2487.48] To condemn the world
[2487.48 → 2489.16] It's not the day
[2489.16 → 2489.62] Of judgment
[2489.62 → 2491.60] He sent his son
[2491.60 → 2492.08] Into the world
[2492.08 → 2493.24] To save the world
[2493.24 → 2494.18] Through him
[2494.18 → 2495.54] Right?
[2495.60 → 2496.58] And this has always
[2496.58 → 2498.06] Been God's loving
[2498.06 → 2499.12] And gracious plan
[2499.12 → 2501.26] God sends Jesus
[2501.26 → 2502.06] Into the world
[2502.06 → 2503.54] Not to destroy us
[2503.54 → 2505.40] Not to condemn us
[2505.40 → 2507.46] But to purify us
[2507.46 → 2509.16] And so look at
[2509.16 → 2509.74] Verse 3
[2509.74 → 2511.56] The Lord
[2511.56 → 2513.04] When he comes
[2513.04 → 2513.88] The Messiah
[2513.88 → 2514.76] John the Baptist
[2514.76 → 2515.26] Came
[2515.26 → 2516.70] Prepare the way
[2516.70 → 2517.20] For the Lord
[2517.20 → 2518.28] And then Jesus came
[2518.28 → 2519.62] This is what he's
[2519.62 → 2520.08] Talking about
[2520.08 → 2520.74] In our passage
[2520.74 → 2521.24] And then
[2521.24 → 2522.18] When Jesus comes
[2522.18 → 2523.52] He will sit
[2523.52 → 2524.54] As a refiner
[2524.54 → 2525.36] And purifier
[2525.36 → 2525.88] Of silver
[2525.88 → 2527.10] He will purify
[2527.10 → 2527.86] The Levites
[2527.86 → 2528.92] And refine them
[2528.92 → 2529.86] Like gold and silver
[2529.86 → 2532.16] When God comes
[2532.16 → 2533.94] It was supposed
[2533.94 → 2534.90] To be the day
[2534.90 → 2535.34] Of judgment
[2535.34 → 2537.24] But God knows
[2537.24 → 2537.76] His people
[2537.76 → 2538.98] Will not pass
[2538.98 → 2539.80] Through that day
[2539.80 → 2541.00] So instead
[2541.00 → 2541.90] Before that day
[2541.90 → 2542.30] Of judgment
[2542.30 → 2543.40] He comes down
[2543.40 → 2544.12] Into the world
[2544.12 → 2545.82] He walks
[2545.82 → 2546.54] On the soil
[2546.54 → 2547.18] Of earth
[2547.18 → 2548.96] He draws near
[2548.96 → 2549.60] To us
[2549.60 → 2550.50] And he does so
[2550.50 → 2552.18] To purify us
[2552.18 → 2553.80] To cleanse us
[2553.80 → 2555.50] And the picture
[2555.50 → 2556.64] Malachi gives us
[2556.64 → 2558.60] Is of a silversmith
[2558.60 → 2559.68] Refining silver
[2559.68 → 2561.86] So imagine
[2561.86 → 2562.66] A silversmith
[2562.66 → 2563.64] In the ancient world
[2563.64 → 2564.96] A silversmith
[2564.96 → 2565.54] Would have
[2565.54 → 2567.06] His burning coals
[2567.06 → 2567.88] In his workshop
[2567.88 → 2569.28] And he'd have
[2569.28 → 2569.82] A pot
[2569.82 → 2571.16] Where all these
[2571.16 → 2573.08] Silver ingots
[2573.08 → 2574.14] I think they're called
[2574.14 → 2576.26] Would be placed
[2576.26 → 2577.02] In that pot
[2577.02 → 2577.90] And put over
[2577.90 → 2578.38] The coals
[2578.38 → 2578.88] Of the fire
[2578.88 → 2580.38] And then what would
[2580.38 → 2581.12] Happen is that
[2581.12 → 2582.10] Silver would begin
[2582.10 → 2582.86] To melt down
[2582.86 → 2585.16] And as it did so
[2585.16 → 2586.36] All the dross
[2586.36 → 2587.28] All the impurities
[2587.28 → 2588.56] Would slowly begin
[2588.56 → 2589.66] To rise to the top
[2589.66 → 2590.06] Some of them
[2590.06 → 2590.78] Would burn off
[2590.78 → 2591.84] Others would just
[2591.84 → 2592.84] Kind of float to the top
[2592.84 → 2593.28] And it would be
[2593.28 → 2593.82] Kind of this
[2593.82 → 2595.02] Intimate thing
[2595.02 → 2595.84] That the silversmith
[2595.84 → 2596.34] Would do
[2596.34 → 2597.70] Where he would
[2597.70 → 2598.94] Slowly scrape
[2598.94 → 2600.00] The dross off
[2600.00 → 2601.90] He would slowly
[2601.90 → 2604.08] Remove each purity
[2604.08 → 2606.12] And he knew
[2606.12 → 2606.68] His work
[2606.68 → 2607.26] Was finally
[2607.26 → 2607.88] Complete
[2607.88 → 2609.44] When he could
[2609.44 → 2610.20] Fully see
[2610.20 → 2611.10] His image
[2611.10 → 2612.18] In the molten
[2612.18 → 2612.66] Silver
[2612.66 → 2614.18] As in a mirror
[2614.18 → 2616.30] And in the same
[2616.30 → 2616.66] Way
[2616.66 → 2617.46] God as the
[2617.46 → 2618.32] Great refiner
[2618.32 → 2619.20] Of his people
[2619.20 → 2621.24] Came not in
[2621.24 → 2621.86] Judgment to
[2621.86 → 2622.58] Condemn us
[2622.58 → 2623.06] But he came
[2623.06 → 2624.10] To purify us
[2624.10 → 2625.56] Until he could
[2625.56 → 2627.42] See his image
[2627.42 → 2628.30] In his people
[2628.30 → 2631.18] So how can
[2631.18 → 2631.78] The refining
[2631.78 → 2632.60] Fires of God
[2632.60 → 2633.46] Not consume us
[2633.46 → 2634.78] That's the question
[2634.78 → 2635.56] We have to ask
[2635.56 → 2637.24] And the answer
[2637.24 → 2638.84] Is the cross
[2638.84 → 2639.96] Right
[2639.96 → 2640.68] On the cross
[2640.68 → 2641.76] Jesus endured
[2641.76 → 2642.82] The judgment
[2642.82 → 2643.50] Of God
[2643.50 → 2644.46] The justice
[2644.46 → 2645.14] Of God
[2645.14 → 2647.06] Against our sin
[2647.06 → 2648.78] And our unfaithfulness
[2648.78 → 2650.10] The unfaithfulness
[2650.10 → 2650.88] Of his people
[2650.88 → 2653.12] The fires
[2653.12 → 2653.88] Of God's judgment
[2653.88 → 2655.08] Against evildoers
[2655.08 → 2656.32] That no one
[2656.32 → 2657.28] Could stand
[2657.28 → 2658.96] Jesus endured
[2658.96 → 2660.58] And he endured
[2660.58 → 2661.38] It for us
[2661.38 → 2663.18] And as a refiner
[2663.18 → 2663.76] Father's fire
[2663.76 → 2665.48] Removes all impurities
[2665.48 → 2666.78] So that only
[2666.78 → 2668.26] The pure remains
[2668.26 → 2670.02] God dealt
[2670.02 → 2670.64] With the sins
[2670.64 → 2671.26] Of his people
[2671.26 → 2671.94] On the cross
[2671.94 → 2673.32] So that only
[2673.32 → 2674.54] Jesus' faithfulness
[2674.54 → 2675.60] Only Jesus'
[2675.90 → 2676.50] Righteousness
[2676.50 → 2677.04] Remains
[2677.04 → 2678.88] And the friends
[2678.88 → 2679.54] The good news
[2679.54 → 2680.18] Of the gospel
[2680.18 → 2681.56] Is that when
[2681.56 → 2682.52] We are united
[2682.52 → 2683.00] To Christ
[2683.00 → 2683.90] By faith in him
[2683.90 → 2685.74] When we are united
[2685.74 → 2686.18] To Christ
[2686.18 → 2687.30] In his death
[2687.30 → 2688.30] And his resurrection
[2688.30 → 2689.14] He then
[2689.14 → 2690.28] He clothes us
[2690.28 → 2692.66] In his pure righteousness
[2692.66 → 2694.72] Jesus takes
[2694.72 → 2696.32] On the condemning
[2696.32 → 2697.14] Fires of judgment
[2697.14 → 2698.06] So that those
[2698.06 → 2698.96] In him
[2698.96 → 2699.88] Might then
[2699.88 → 2701.02] Be refined
[2701.02 → 2702.22] In him
[2702.22 → 2703.62] By him
[2703.62 → 2705.84] And that means
[2705.84 → 2707.18] The fires of trials
[2707.18 → 2708.60] The fires of discipline
[2708.60 → 2710.20] That he puts us in
[2710.20 → 2711.82] Are so that his image
[2711.82 → 2713.58] Could shine
[2713.58 → 2715.04] More clearly
[2715.04 → 2715.72] In us
[2715.72 → 2717.66] And this is what
[2717.66 → 2718.56] Peter is getting at
[2718.56 → 2719.38] In 1 Peter
[2719.38 → 2720.48] Chapter 1
[2720.48 → 2721.44] Verses 6 and 7
[2721.44 → 2723.52] When he says this
[2723.52 → 2724.06] He says
[2724.06 → 2725.40] In all of this
[2725.40 → 2726.70] You greatly rejoice
[2726.70 → 2727.40] So now
[2727.40 → 2728.34] For a little while
[2728.34 → 2730.02] You may have had
[2730.02 → 2731.42] To suffer grief
[2731.42 → 2732.50] And all kinds
[2732.50 → 2733.04] Of trials
[2733.04 → 2734.38] These have come
[2734.38 → 2735.48] So that the proven
[2735.48 → 2736.24] Tenuous
[2736.24 → 2737.54] Genuineness
[2737.54 → 2738.54] Of your faith
[2738.54 → 2740.28] Of greater worth
[2740.28 → 2740.76] Than gold
[2740.76 → 2741.50] Which perishes
[2741.50 → 2742.38] Even though refined
[2742.38 → 2743.00] By fire
[2743.00 → 2744.18] May result
[2744.18 → 2745.12] In praise
[2745.12 → 2746.08] Glory and honour
[2746.08 → 2747.74] When Jesus Christ
[2747.74 → 2748.46] Is revealed
[2748.46 → 2751.50] This is the refining
[2751.50 → 2752.40] Work of Christ
[2752.40 → 2754.00] And as we look
[2754.00 → 2754.94] To the cross
[2754.94 → 2757.66] We see this priority
[2757.66 → 2758.76] In the heart of Jesus
[2758.76 → 2760.28] This priority
[2760.28 → 2761.06] To cleanse
[2761.06 → 2762.62] And purify his people
[2762.62 → 2764.22] To justify them
[2764.22 → 2765.88] And then to sanctify them
[2765.88 → 2768.92] And now as he refines us
[2768.92 → 2770.58] We can trust in him
[2770.58 → 2772.42] In whatever fire
[2772.42 → 2773.52] He has us in
[2773.52 → 2776.34] And when we have a God
[2776.34 → 2778.36] Who is this loving to us
[2778.36 → 2780.32] A God who is this kind to us
[2780.32 → 2782.08] What can we do
[2782.08 → 2783.44] But return to him
[2783.44 → 2784.86] What can we do
[2784.86 → 2786.58] But return
[2786.58 → 2787.80] As he is calling
[2787.80 → 2789.40] Into his fatherly arms
[2789.40 → 2791.88] Now finally
[2791.88 → 2792.52] Look with me
[2792.52 → 2793.18] At verse 3
[2793.18 → 2795.44] It says
[2795.44 → 2796.76] He will purify
[2796.76 → 2797.72] The Levites
[2797.72 → 2799.34] And he will refine them
[2799.34 → 2800.38] Like gold and silver
[2800.38 → 2801.82] Then the Lord
[2801.82 → 2802.52] Will have men
[2802.52 → 2803.52] Who will bring offerings
[2803.52 → 2804.34] In righteousness
[2804.34 → 2806.12] And the offerings
[2806.12 → 2806.72] Of Judah
[2806.72 → 2807.38] In Jerusalem
[2807.38 → 2809.10] Will be pleasing
[2809.10 → 2810.10] To the Lord
[2810.10 → 2811.24] As in the days
[2811.24 → 2811.70] Gone by
[2811.70 → 2813.22] As in former years
[2813.22 → 2814.74] Right remember
[2814.74 → 2816.96] We started off
[2816.96 → 2818.68] In chapter 2
[2818.68 → 2819.52] Verse 17
[2819.52 → 2820.96] With God saying what
[2820.96 → 2823.76] You have wearied me
[2823.76 → 2825.70] And by the time
[2825.70 → 2826.56] We get here
[2826.56 → 2828.22] Through the refining work
[2828.22 → 2828.78] Of Christ
[2828.78 → 2829.84] He says
[2829.84 → 2831.24] You're pleasing
[2831.24 → 2832.06] To me
[2832.06 → 2834.32] You're pleasing to me
[2834.32 → 2835.52] Right
[2835.52 → 2836.70] In the light of Christ
[2836.70 → 2837.48] Refining
[2837.48 → 2838.72] Of us
[2838.72 → 2839.82] Weariness
[2839.82 → 2841.18] Gives way
[2841.18 → 2841.86] To the pleasure
[2841.86 → 2842.42] Of God
[2842.42 → 2844.72] Judgment is still coming
[2844.72 → 2846.54] That's what verse 5 says
[2846.54 → 2847.90] But it did not
[2847.90 → 2848.60] Come
[2848.60 → 2849.66] With Jesus'
[2849.90 → 2850.54] First appearing
[2850.54 → 2852.84] The day of grace
[2852.84 → 2853.64] Comes first
[2853.64 → 2855.24] And when he comes
[2855.24 → 2856.46] Again the second time
[2856.46 → 2858.06] It will be the day
[2858.06 → 2858.50] Of judgment
[2858.50 → 2860.52] We are in
[2860.52 → 2861.46] The day of grace
[2861.46 → 2861.92] Right now
[2861.92 → 2863.22] And we should be
[2863.22 → 2863.84] Thankful for that
[2863.84 → 2864.82] This is the day
[2864.82 → 2865.66] Of salvation
[2865.66 → 2866.68] This is the day
[2866.68 → 2867.78] Of repentance
[2867.78 → 2869.70] You know
[2869.70 → 2870.36] And sometimes
[2870.36 → 2871.58] Just like God's
[2871.58 → 2872.46] People
[2872.46 → 2874.14] In Malachi's day
[2874.14 → 2875.44] We look around
[2875.44 → 2875.90] At the evil
[2875.90 → 2876.44] In the world
[2876.44 → 2878.10] And we ask
[2878.10 → 2879.10] Where is the God
[2879.10 → 2879.58] Of justice
[2879.58 → 2880.94] When will God
[2880.94 → 2881.54] Come
[2881.54 → 2884.62] Why does the God
[2884.62 → 2885.62] Of the universe
[2885.62 → 2886.98] Not speak
[2886.98 → 2888.84] Why does he seem
[2888.84 → 2889.48] So silent
[2889.48 → 2890.86] And the answer
[2890.86 → 2892.08] Malachi gives us
[2892.08 → 2893.90] Is that it is because
[2893.90 → 2895.20] God has already
[2895.20 → 2896.20] Spoken every
[2896.20 → 2897.44] Gracious word
[2897.44 → 2898.92] That needs to be said
[2898.92 → 2902.66] In the scriptures
[2902.66 → 2903.70] He has given us
[2903.70 → 2904.78] Everything we need
[2904.78 → 2906.14] To know Christ
[2906.14 → 2907.50] To be reconciled
[2907.50 → 2907.92] To him
[2907.92 → 2909.32] To live as
[2909.32 → 2909.80] His people
[2909.80 → 2911.68] God is silent
[2911.68 → 2912.12] Now
[2912.12 → 2913.34] Because when
[2913.34 → 2914.36] He speaks again
[2914.36 → 2915.56] It will be
[2915.56 → 2916.32] The day of judgment
[2916.32 → 2918.34] So I want to
[2918.34 → 2918.94] Leave us with a
[2918.94 → 2919.82] Question this morning
[2919.82 → 2921.46] Are you going
[2921.46 → 2922.48] To try to stand
[2922.48 → 2923.68] On your own
[2923.68 → 2924.66] Two feet
[2924.66 → 2926.00] Before God
[2926.00 → 2927.62] Or are you
[2927.62 → 2928.28] Going to cling
[2928.28 → 2929.02] To Christ
[2929.02 → 2930.80] In what he has
[2930.80 → 2931.76] Accomplished for you
[2931.76 → 2932.38] On the cross
[2932.38 → 2934.82] Only by placing
[2934.82 → 2935.36] Your faith
[2935.36 → 2935.80] And trust
[2935.80 → 2936.38] In Jesus
[2936.38 → 2937.96] Can you pass
[2937.96 → 2938.96] Through the
[2938.96 → 2939.96] Refining fires
[2939.96 → 2940.82] Of God's judgment
[2940.82 → 2942.74] And then
[2942.74 → 2944.06] Not only that
[2944.06 → 2945.92] Christ's refining work
[2945.92 → 2946.56] Changes
[2946.56 → 2948.04] The way we live
[2948.04 → 2948.66] Here and now
[2948.66 → 2949.94] And our lives
[2949.94 → 2950.50] Start to look
[2950.50 → 2951.10] More beautiful
[2951.10 → 2952.46] Our lives
[2952.46 → 2954.10] Like refined silver
[2954.10 → 2955.20] Start to shine
[2955.20 → 2956.12] And they start
[2956.12 → 2956.84] To mirror
[2956.84 → 2958.22] The image
[2958.22 → 2959.42] Of our
[2959.42 → 2959.72] Saviour
[2959.72 → 2960.56] Jesus Christ
[2960.56 → 2962.38] Let's pray
[2962.38 → 2968.18] Father we thank you
[2968.18 → 2969.00] For the day
[2969.00 → 2969.82] Of grace
[2969.82 → 2972.52] That you have
[2972.52 → 2972.94] Come
[2972.94 → 2974.44] Not
[2974.44 → 2975.78] To condemn us
[2975.78 → 2975.98] Lord
[2975.98 → 2976.64] None of us
[2976.64 → 2977.28] Would stand
[2977.28 → 2979.40] We think
[2979.40 → 2979.90] That we're
[2979.90 → 2980.42] Maybe not
[2980.42 → 2981.00] Going as
[2981.00 → 2981.70] Fast as
[2981.70 → 2982.20] Others
[2982.20 → 2984.26] We're not
[2984.26 → 2984.96] Living
[2984.96 → 2987.08] As recklessly
[2987.08 → 2987.92] As
[2987.92 → 2988.48] Frequently
[2988.48 → 2990.88] Of your
[2990.88 → 2991.26] Law
[2991.26 → 2993.04] But Lord
[2993.04 → 2993.52] We are all
[2993.52 → 2993.88] Guilty
[2993.88 → 2996.02] The Lord
[2996.02 → 2996.32] In your
[2996.32 → 2996.72] Love
[2996.72 → 2997.44] Your kindness
[2997.44 → 2997.88] To us
[2997.88 → 2998.30] You come
[2998.30 → 2998.72] First
[2998.72 → 2999.18] Not to
[2999.18 → 2999.82] Condemn
[2999.82 → 3000.50] But to
[3000.50 → 3001.28] Purify us
[3001.28 → 3002.10] To make
[3002.10 → 3002.42] Us your
[3002.42 → 3003.06] Holy people
[3003.06 → 3004.72] So Lord
[3004.72 → 3005.16] Would you
[3005.16 → 3005.72] Help each
[3005.72 → 3006.42] One of us
[3006.42 → 3007.10] Become
[3007.10 → 3008.68] That silver
[3008.68 → 3009.90] That is
[3009.90 → 3010.64] Continually
[3010.64 → 3011.38] Refined
[3011.38 → 3012.62] By the
[3012.62 → 3013.10] Fires
[3013.10 → 3013.96] Of whatever
[3013.96 → 3014.54] Trials
[3014.54 → 3014.80] That you
[3014.80 → 3015.12] Put us
[3015.12 → 3015.36] Through
[3015.36 → 3015.98] Knowing
[3015.98 → 3016.42] That you
[3016.42 → 3016.90] Are a
[3016.90 → 3017.10] Loving
[3017.10 → 3017.48] Father
[3017.48 → 3018.60] And that
[3018.60 → 3018.76] You're
[3018.76 → 3019.02] Seeking
[3019.02 → 3019.64] To remove
[3019.64 → 3020.06] Our sin
[3020.06 → 3020.76] From us
[3020.76 → 3021.00] You have
[3021.00 → 3021.36] Removed
[3021.36 → 3021.66] It from
[3021.66 → 3022.18] The cross
[3022.18 → 3022.86] And Lord
[3022.86 → 3023.46] You continued
[3023.46 → 3023.96] That work
[3023.96 → 3024.26] In our
[3024.26 → 3024.52] Lives
[3024.52 → 3025.02] Even now
[3025.02 → 3026.30] Lord
[3026.30 → 3026.76] Make us
[3026.76 → 3027.14] Beautiful
[3027.14 → 3027.56] Not
[3027.56 → 3028.68] Because of
[3028.68 → 3029.34] Who we
[3029.34 → 3029.52] Are
[3029.52 → 3029.94] But because
[3029.94 → 3030.26] Of whom
[3030.26 → 3030.74] You are
[3030.74 → 3030.96] And what
[3030.96 → 3031.34] You are
[3031.34 → 3031.62] Doing
[3031.62 → 3032.46] In our
[3032.46 → 3032.88] Lives
[3032.88 → 3033.56] By your
[3033.56 → 3033.74] Holy
[3033.74 → 3034.16] Spirit
[3034.16 → 3035.64] Lord
[3035.64 → 3036.24] Would we
[3036.24 → 3037.30] Cooperate
[3037.30 → 3037.62] With the
[3037.62 → 3037.90] Spirit
[3037.90 → 3038.26] Would we
[3038.26 → 3038.62] Walk
[3038.62 → 3038.98] With the
[3038.98 → 3039.26] Spirit
[3039.26 → 3040.38] Allow you
[3040.38 → 3040.64] To do
[3040.64 → 3041.02] Your work
[3041.02 → 3041.48] In us
[3041.48 → 3042.76] So that
[3042.76 → 3043.04] Lord
[3043.04 → 3043.74] In Christ
[3043.74 → 3044.18] We may
[3044.18 → 3044.74] Face
[3044.74 → 3045.92] That day
[3045.92 → 3047.66] With joy
[3047.66 → 3048.98] We pray
[3048.98 → 3049.38] In his
[3049.38 → 3049.88] Holy name
[3049.88 → 3050.62] Amen
[3050.62 → 3053.08] So we're
[3053.08 → 3053.16] Going to
[3053.16 → 3053.58] Sing a
[3053.58 → 3053.92] Song
[3053.92 → 3054.66] A song
[3054.66 → 3054.76] Of
[3054.76 → 3055.18] Response
[3055.18 → 3055.78] Called
[3055.78 → 3057.26] The
[3057.26 → 3057.70] Servant
[3057.70 → 3058.06] King
[3058.06 → 3058.84] So let's
[3058.84 → 3059.38] Stand and
[3059.38 → 3059.72] Let's sing
[3059.72 → 3060.00] The song
[3060.00 → 3060.10] Of
[3060.10 → 3060.42] Response
[3060.42 → 3060.78] Together
[3090.42 → 3092.42] Turn
[3092.42 → 3093.42] Turn
[3093.42 → 3093.54] Turn
[3093.54 → 3093.58] Turn
[3093.58 → 3093.96] Of
[3093.96 → 3094.76] Worth
[3094.76 → 3095.00] In
[3095.00 → 3095.42] The
[3095.42 → 3096.36] Glory
[3096.36 → 3098.20] Way
[3098.20 → 3099.18] Not
[3099.18 → 3099.94] To be
[3099.94 → 3100.78] Served
[3100.78 → 3101.10] But
[3101.10 → 3101.46] To
[3101.46 → 3102.78] Serve
[3102.78 → 3104.88] And
[3104.88 → 3105.30] Give
[3105.30 → 3105.60] Your
[3105.60 → 3106.62] Life
[3106.62 → 3107.06] And
[3107.06 → 3107.66] We

[3108.48 → 3109.98] Name
[3109.98 → 3110.82] And
[3110.82 → 3111.26] Cease
[3111.26 → 3111.66] Our

[3113.16 → 3113.80] The
[3113.80 → 3114.54] Servant
[3114.54 → 3115.74] King
[3115.74 → 3116.66] He
[3116.66 → 3117.42] Knows us
[3117.42 → 3118.46] Out
[3118.46 → 3118.74] And
[3118.74 → 3119.54] Follow
[3119.54 → 3121.48] Him
[3121.48 → 3122.26] Don't
[3122.26 → 3122.66] Break
[3122.66 → 3123.02] Our
[3123.02 → 3124.06] Night
