• Introduction to Ladder Christian Reformed Church
• The church is part of a larger family of believers, including those across Vancouver, the nation, and worldwide
• Emphasis on being one faithful piece of the larger puzzle of God's kingdom
• Importance of worshipping Jesus and holding onto the gospel message
• Call to worship from Revelation 7, inviting all nations and people to stand before the throne and praise God
• Prayer of adoration, acknowledging God's power, wisdom, and worthiness of praise
• Request for God to help the congregation enter a space of worship where they can hear from Him and respond.

• Singing and praising God with lyrics such as "How great is our God" and "Name above all names"
• Lyrics from the hymn "How Great Thou Art" expressing gratitude for God's love and mercy
• Discussion of God's majesty and beauty, with phrases such as "Beautiful what I love" and "Powerful, so powerful"
• Reference to Scripture or possibly a church document titled "Our World Belongs to God" and its relevance to the discussion
• The church is called to join God's mission in the world through the gospel of the kingdom.
• The Spirit calls all members to participate in God's mission in their neighbourhoods and in the world.
• The mission includes caring for the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and prisoner.
• The congregation confesses its failure to live into this mission and repents of leaving it to a few.
• A prayer of confession is recited, acknowledging apathy, isolation, callousness, obstinacy, and legalism.
• The congregation prays for God's forgiveness, healing, and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
• The Triune God is praised as ascending, missionary, and rescuing God who sent Jesus to save a people in need of rescue.
• The power of God's forgiving love and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
• The importance of humility and gratitude in responding to God's mercy
• The transition from a combined class to separate classes for children starting next Sunday
• The reading of Acts 15:1-21, discussing the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in the early Christian church
• James' interpretation of Scripture as supporting the inclusion of Gentiles in the church without requiring circumcision
• The pastor thanks everyone for giving his family time off
• He discusses continuing a series on the Book of Acts, which shows the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire
• A passage in Acts will be examined, which addresses the church's first major internal crisis and conflict
• The pastor asks listeners to imagine a space visitor studying Christianity and observing its practices, beliefs, and concerns over time
• The space visitor visits early Jerusalem Christians who are all Jews, observe their daily lives and worship practices
• Four centuries later, he returns to find monks in Ireland reading the same holy writings as the original Jerusalem Christians, but with an additional collection called the New Testament.
• The space visitor travels through time and observes different groups of Christians in various historical periods
• He notices that despite cultural and temporal differences, all these groups share a fundamental unity through faith in Jesus Christ
• They worship Jesus as Lord, read the Bible as their guide to faith and life, and desire to love God and their neighbours
• The space visitor comes to understand that Christianity can adapt to different times and cultures while maintaining its core essence
• The speaker recounts the story of Paul and Barnabas' missionary journey to the Gentiles
• The debate about whether Gentile Christians should adopt Jewish customs is discussed
• The main issue in this debate is whether Gentiles must be circumcised and follow Mosaic Law to become part of God's people
• The speaker references Acts 15, known as the Jerusalem Council
• The decision made at the council had a significant impact on church history
• The church in Jerusalem made significant decisions that allowed anyone, everywhere, to become Christian and part of the people of God.
• Two key decisions were made: reconceiving their identity and practicing love.
• The church's identity is being questioned, with debates about who they are, how they got that way, and who has the right to change it.
• Jesus' life, death, resurrection, ascension, and the gift of the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem shaped the early church's identity as Jewish.
• When conflicts arose, the church returned to Jerusalem to resolve them, rather than staying in other locations.
• The Jewish identity and its relation to the church is discussed
• A group of Jewish men from Judea teach Gentiles in Antioch that they must be circumcised to be saved
• Paul and Barnabas disagree with this, saying the church's identity can also be Gentile
• A council is held in Jerusalem to settle the debate, involving Jewish leaders and apostles
• Pharisees intervene, arguing that Gentiles should be required to keep the law of Moses.
• Debate about whether Gentile believers need to be circumcised and follow Jewish law
• Peter's argument that God shows acceptance through giving the Holy Spirit, not law
• Peter's statement that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ, not law
• James' agreement with Peter that Gentiles are part of God's people
• Reference to prophecy from Amos about rebuilding David's fallen tent and restoring Israel
• The identity of the church is not fundamentally Jewish or Gentile
• It is a new thing God has always intended to create
• Our identity as a church is eschatological (derived from the end times)
• We must look at what God is doing, not our own culture or personal history
• The church must reconceive its identities and see itself as one holy, catholic, and apostolic body
• This requires letting go of old identities based on being Jewish or Gentile
• The speaker discusses how James, Jesus' brother, initially misunderstood Jesus and thought he was crazy
• James' perspective on Jesus changed after the resurrection, leading him to see his own identity differently and become a servant and leader of the church
• James led the church in rethinking its identity in light of what Jesus has done and is still doing
• The speaker asks how one thinks about the identity of the church and whether it's through personal history, preferences, or Jesus' actions
• The importance of practicing love as a community of believers, as God's intention to build a community of love among us
• James' words in verse 19 of Acts 15, emphasizing the need not make things difficult for Gentiles turning to God and instead write them a letter with guidelines for living together as the church
• The church reached a consensus about practicing love towards one another
• Jewish Christians wrote a pastoral letter calling for everyone to give something to love the other
• They told everyone to love one another without starting committees, writing confessions, or doing term rotations
• Jewish Christians practiced love by embracing Gentiles without requiring them to keep the law
• They acknowledged that keeping the law would be too hard for Gentile brothers and sisters, and that Jesus fulfilled the righteous requirements of the law in their place
• The law is not what makes you right with God; we are saved by faith in Jesus
• Jewish Christians decided to practice love by not requiring Gentile Christians to observe Jewish customs and practices
• Gentile Christians were also called to the practice of love, including following some Jewish food customs
• Gentile Christians were expected to abstain from certain food practices that were considered immoral by Jewish standards
• The church wanted Jews and Gentiles to have fellowship together, but knew this would be difficult if Gentiles continued their old habits
• James led the church in asking Gentile Christians to avoid these practices out of love and respect for Jewish brethren
• This decision was made because James had experienced what it means for someone else to deny themselves for his benefit
• The goal was for the church to imitate Christ's self-giving love, as seen in Paul's letter to the Galatians
• The motivation behind this request was not to make Gentiles right with God, but out of love and a desire for unity within the church
• The importance of being free in Christ without using that freedom to indulge in sinful behaviour
• The law of love as a greater law that must be adhered to
• The need for balance between standing firm on the truth of the gospel and showing love and compassion to others
• Martin Luther's quote about Paul being strong in faith but soft in love, and the desire for churches to have this same balance.
• Discussion of prayer and asking God to teach them self-giving love
• Singing a song in response to the prayer
• A hymn about building a house where all are welcome, and people from different backgrounds can come together
• Collection of tithes and offerings as a way of worshipping God
• Announcement of two designated offerings: for Delta Christian School and the Canadian Red Cross
