• Christians face high levels of persecution worldwide

• Persecution is not limited to physical violence but also includes cultural pressure and ridicule
• Jesus' beatitude "Blessed are the persecuted" implies that persecution is an inevitable part of following him
• The reason for persecution is not because of personal behaviour, but because of one's association with Christ.
• Jesus teaches that believers are blessed when persecuted for righteousness' sake
• A person is described as righteous when their heart, soul, mind, and strength align with God's will and character
• Believers may face persecution because they don't belong to the world but rather to Jesus and his kingdom
• The kingdoms of this world and God's kingdom are in conflict
• Augustine explained that human beings are divided into two cities/identities: one based on love of self, the other on love of God
• The dividing line between these two is seeking glory from oneself versus seeking glory from God
• Claiming Jesus as Lord can be a demonstration of loyalty to him
• Early Christians faced persecution for saying "Jesus is Lord" and rejecting Caesar's authority
• Similarly today, following Jesus' teachings and word will put one in conflict with the world
• Christians are called to live as the light of the world and confront darkness, leading to potential persecution
• Supreme loyalty to Jesus and his kingdom can lead to ridicule, mockery, and even execution, as seen in examples from William Wilberforce and Martin Luther King Jr.
• Following Jesus requires surrendering to him, even when it's challenging
• Being a Christian means rejecting parts of the surrounding culture that are opposed to God's kingdom
• Wisdom is needed to know how to live as a Christian in different cultures
• Persecution for righteousness' sake is not just about physical harm, but also about being rejected by those around you due to your faith
• The question remains: will we surrender our reputation and social standing to Jesus?
• Following Jesus can lead to opposition, hostility, mistreatment, and rejection
• Those who experience this are blessed and in sync with Jesus' kingdom
• Persecution is a response that Jesus talks about, citing verse 12
• Suffering is a badge of true discipleship, as stated by Dietrich Bonhoeffer
• Christians should be willing to suffer for Christ, seeing it as a joy and token of God's grace
• When encountering persecution, one should rejoice and be glad because of the reward in heaven
• The world persecutes those who follow Jesus, but being persecuted is a privilege that earns you a place among the prophets
• Persecution can be a comfort because it means you are not alone in your faith
