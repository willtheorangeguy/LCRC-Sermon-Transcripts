[0.00 → 3.24] Yeah,
[3.24 → 5.94] yeah.
[5.94 → 6.94] Yeah.
[6.94 → 12.94] Ah in.
[20.30 → 25.64] All ANH.
[25.64 → 27.66] Ah yeah.
[27.66 → 57.64] Thank you.
[57.66 → 87.64] Thank you.
[87.66 → 117.64] Thank you.
[117.66 → 147.64] Thank you.
[147.66 → 177.64] Thank you.
[177.66 → 207.64] Thank you.
[207.66 → 237.64] Thank you.
[237.66 → 267.64] Thank you.
[267.66 → 297.64] Thank you.
[297.66 → 327.64] Thank you.
[327.64 → 331.74] Before we begin our time of worship, there are just a couple of announcements.
[332.90 → 340.74] One is next Sunday, we will begin our choir rehearsals for preparing for our Christmas
[340.74 → 348.48] morning, December 24, Christmas Eve morning service.
[348.48 → 352.40] So that starts next Sunday, so that starts next Sunday, I believe, and you still have some
[352.40 → 356.64] time to sign up, and you can sign up on the sign-up sheet on the table in the foyer.
[357.76 → 362.02] As well, next Sunday, we will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[362.02 → 367.94] And so it can be a Sunday of singing, we can go to choir rehearsal, and then at 2.00, we can go
[367.94 → 391.28] sing at Mountain View Manor. So that is happening next Sunday. As well, I wanted to point out that there's a flyer inserted into your bulletin last Sunday about some of the new library books that we have. And so right outside Dorothy's office, you can see a cart with some new featured books on there.
[391.28 → 402.68] I invite you to check them out. But we've also revamped the library just in the sense of adding some new things, taking out some old things. So please do have a look. And that's a great resource for us.
[402.68 → 410.14] And then lastly, I want to invite Elaine, as a deacon, to share an announcement about our faith promise giving.
[410.14 → 412.14] Good morning.
[426.60 → 430.42] Anyway, good morning. Hope you can hear me.
[430.42 → 441.48] Well, the deacons have placed our yearly faith promise giving letter and pledge forms in your mailboxes today.
[442.40 → 450.78] Now, we've been doing this for several years and are thankful for your prayerful contributions to our ministry here at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[450.78 → 459.18] We are blessed to be able to support our pastors, ministries, and programs run within Ladder CRC.
[459.96 → 465.06] We're also blessed to be able to support the day-to-day operations of the church.
[466.36 → 474.56] This coming year, we again ask that you prayerfully reflect on the giving pledge that you will be able to make.
[474.56 → 489.32] The deacons would like to make you aware that for the 2024 year, a significant financial challenge is foreseen due to several factors that are mentioned in the faith promise giving letter.
[491.12 → 500.38] The Ladder Christian Reformed Church has always been a very faithful and giving church, and we have always been able to meet our needs.
[500.38 → 513.30] We ask that this year, everyone, please complete the faith promise giving pledge form, even if you have not done so in the past.
[514.36 → 522.66] We also humbly ask that you please consider increasing your pledge to help with the growing needs within the church.
[522.66 → 534.18] We understand the financial difficulties that many people here are experiencing, so please only give what you are comfortable with and able to give.
[535.64 → 545.06] Please prayerfully reflect on how you can support, you can help support Ladder Christian Reformed Church before filling out the pledge form.
[546.16 → 550.92] We will collect the completed forms in three weeks on December 3rd.
[550.92 → 559.02] Thank you for your faithfulness to and support of God's work at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[570.42 → 571.42] Thank you, Elaine.

[613.80 → 615.06] and rally unda while complaining
[615.06 → 616.52] to those who I am so well.
[616.52 → 618.40] So I'm going to do that, for Jesus is the gift of food,
[618.40 → 620.88] I love productivity, saint- IHT special of women
[620.88 → 622.72] because I am so kidding.
[622.86 → 627.34] It's only one goody Frankly and I do not prove
[627.52 → 630.94] that you try to do that ____ these pictures
[630.94 → 638.12] to centre our lives, our hearts, our minds on who God is,
[638.16 → 642.72] that he is the God who created us and who loves us and who has redeemed us.
[643.32 → 646.74] So let's hear these words of scripture and also respond to them.
[646.74 → 650.96] They'll be found on the screen behind me from Psalm 135.
[654.46 → 657.06] So where it's the single arrow I will read,
[657.06 → 661.16] then where it's the double arrow I invite you to all read aloud with me.
[661.96 → 662.54] I'll begin.
[663.68 → 664.58] Praise the Lord.
[665.36 → 666.88] Praise the name of the Lord.
[667.28 → 670.26] Praise him, you servants of the Lord.
[671.14 → 673.36] You who stand in the house of the Lord,
[673.84 → 676.94] in the courts of the house of our God.
[679.02 → 681.26] No, oh wow, okay, yes, together let's do it.
[681.52 → 684.12] Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good.
[684.12 → 688.14] Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
[688.88 → 691.62] Your name, Lord, endures forever.
[692.28 → 695.90] Your renowned, Lord, through all generations.
[697.24 → 698.80] I appreciate the enthusiasm.
[700.04 → 705.08] Please, let's bow our heads and let's pray this prayer of adoration to our God.
[705.64 → 709.58] Oh Lord, our God, we thank you for the instruction in your word
[709.58 → 715.22] that reminds us that praise is due you because you are good.
[716.08 → 719.56] And because you're good, whatever your will is, is good.
[720.42 → 724.64] You're always working for the good of those whom you have called to know you,
[725.28 → 728.24] to be known by you and to be in a relationship with you.
[728.94 → 731.86] But we also praise you because it is good to do so.
[731.86 → 735.88] It brings us true gladness and joy.
[736.50 → 740.06] It satisfies our most fundamental longings.
[740.46 → 743.02] It is what we have been created to do.
[743.72 → 746.58] And we praise you this morning because of your glory,
[747.12 → 748.96] because of your love for us,
[749.38 → 753.64] most clearly revealed in the life, death, and resurrection of your Son.
[754.66 → 757.18] So, Father, would you receive our praises this morning?
[757.18 → 760.46] Would you be lifted in our hearts and in our minds,
[760.64 → 763.52] with our voices, in our prayers, our requests,
[764.14 → 767.84] and in our fellowship with one another as your body, the church.
[768.44 → 771.62] For we pray all of this in Christ's name and for his sake.
[772.28 → 772.66] Amen.
[773.58 → 779.44] Brothers and sisters, let's stand and receive God's greeting to you this morning.
[780.02 → 784.66] Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[785.42 → 787.88] So, as God has called us and he's greeted us,
[787.94 → 789.80] let's turn and let's greet those around you.

[1023.34 → 1025.34] Amen.
[1025.34 → 1027.34] Amen.
[1027.34 → 1036.14] Everyone needs compassion
[1036.14 → 1039.50] Love that's never failing
[1039.50 → 1045.72] Let mercy fall on me
[1045.72 → 1048.86] Everyone needs forgiveness
[1048.86 → 1052.06] The kindness of the Saviour
[1052.06 → 1057.70] The whole of nations
[1057.70 → 1068.42] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[1068.42 → 1072.38] My God is mighty to save
[1072.38 → 1075.80] He is mighty to save
[1075.80 → 1080.50] Forever, Father of salvation
[1080.50 → 1084.64] He lost and conquered the grave
[1084.64 → 1087.74] Jesus conquered the grave
[1087.74 → 1105.94] So take me as you find me
[1105.94 → 1109.08] All my fears and failures
[1109.08 → 1115.14] Fill my life again
[1115.14 → 1118.44] Give my life to follow
[1118.44 → 1122.08] Everything I believe in
[1122.08 → 1127.22] Now I surrender
[1127.22 → 1130.22] Yes, I surrender
[1130.22 → 1137.22] Saviour, He may move the mountains
[1137.22 → 1141.22] My God is mighty to save
[1141.22 → 1145.24] He is mighty to save
[1145.24 → 1149.38] Forever, Father of salvation
[1149.38 → 1153.90] He rose and conquered the grave
[1153.90 → 1157.44] Jesus conquered the grave
[1157.44 → 1174.58] Shine your light and let the whole world see
[1174.58 → 1180.72] Sing it for the glory of the risen King
[1180.72 → 1186.78] Jesus, shed the light and let the whole world see
[1186.78 → 1192.72] Sing it for the glory of the risen King
[1192.72 → 1193.72] Saviour, Saviour of the risen King
[1193.72 → 1197.86] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[1197.86 → 1198.86] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[1198.86 → 1202.30] My God is mighty to save
[1202.30 → 1204.92] He is mighty to save
[1204.92 → 1209.86] Forever, Father of salvation
[1209.86 → 1214.22] He rose and conquered the grave
[1214.22 → 1216.92] Jesus conquered the grave
[1216.92 → 1241.06] Jesus conquered the grave
[1241.06 → 1246.06] Shine your light and let the whole world see
[1246.06 → 1251.82] Sing it for the glory of the risen King
[1251.82 → 1253.24] Jesus conquered the grave
[1253.24 → 1254.76] Jesus conquered the grave
[1254.76 → 1255.64] Jesus conquered the grave
[1255.64 → 1257.86] Let the whole world see
[1257.86 → 1264.02] Sing it for the glory of the risen King
[1264.02 → 1267.66] Amen
[1267.66 → 1267.74] Amen
[1267.74 → 1285.42] So one of the ways that we know that our God, the Bible, has become real to us
[1285.42 → 1289.20] Is that we are able to be very honest with ourselves
[1289.20 → 1293.22] And with our shortcomings, what the Bible calls sin
[1293.22 → 1296.28] Without it devastating us
[1296.28 → 1298.24] Without it crushing us
[1298.24 → 1300.90] Without it leading us to despair
[1300.90 → 1306.54] And the reason we do this, that we have this time of confession every week
[1306.54 → 1312.02] Is that it's an opportunity for each of us to identify in our hearts
[1312.02 → 1317.66] What might be getting in the way of our relationship with God
[1317.66 → 1322.58] And we can do that because Christ has died on the cross
[1322.58 → 1326.74] He has paid for all of our sins to forgive us
[1326.74 → 1329.68] And to actually give us His righteousness
[1329.68 → 1333.22] So that we stand before God with the righteousness of Christ
[1333.22 → 1335.34] Clothed in His righteousness
[1335.34 → 1338.24] And so we come before Him
[1338.24 → 1341.24] And we want to just see, you know
[1341.24 → 1343.70] Is there anything in our relationship with Him
[1343.70 → 1346.00] That's causing us to feel distance from God
[1346.00 → 1347.42] And so we have this time of confession
[1347.42 → 1348.84] In order to do that
[1348.84 → 1350.86] In order to confess our sin
[1350.86 → 1351.72] To acknowledge it
[1351.72 → 1352.88] To bring it before God
[1352.88 → 1354.38] And to receive His forgiveness
[1354.38 → 1356.88] To search our hearts
[1356.88 → 1358.12] And to ask God
[1358.12 → 1360.12] Is there anything in my heart
[1360.12 → 1362.72] That is preventing me from enjoying you
[1362.72 → 1363.96] And delighting in you
[1363.96 → 1367.78] And so our confession today
[1367.78 → 1369.28] It'll be a responsive reading again
[1369.28 → 1372.06] It comes from Hebrews 4 and Psalm 51
[1372.06 → 1373.86] So I will begin
[1373.86 → 1376.34] The scriptures teach us
[1376.34 → 1378.00] That our Lord Jesus Christ
[1378.00 → 1379.68] Was tempted in every way
[1379.68 → 1380.82] Just as we are
[1380.82 → 1382.76] Yet He did not sin
[1382.76 → 1385.40] Let us therefore cry out
[1385.40 → 1387.62] With the psalmist together
[1387.62 → 1390.84] Have mercy on me, O God
[1390.84 → 1394.10] According to your unfailing love
[1394.10 → 1397.20] According to your great compassion
[1397.20 → 1400.16] Blot out my transgressions
[1400.16 → 1403.50] Wash away all my iniquity
[1403.50 → 1406.60] And cleanse me from my sin
[1406.60 → 1410.52] Let us then approach God's throne of grace
[1410.52 → 1411.48] With confidence
[1411.48 → 1414.56] So that we may receive mercy
[1414.56 → 1416.42] And find grace to help us
[1416.42 → 1418.48] In our time of need
[1418.48 → 1420.26] And so let us do that right now
[1420.26 → 1421.96] Let's spend a few minutes
[1421.96 → 1424.78] Asking God to search our hearts
[1424.78 → 1426.68] Asking Him to reveal to us
[1426.68 → 1428.80] If there is anything in our hearts
[1428.80 → 1430.92] That's keeping us from knowing God truly
[1430.92 → 1432.44] And delighting in Him
[1432.44 → 1434.68] So let's take a time of silent confession
[1434.68 → 1459.36] We praise you, O Father
[1459.36 → 1463.46] For the gift of your Son
[1463.46 → 1466.88] Through whom we may approach you
[1466.88 → 1468.70] Come before your throne of grace
[1468.70 → 1469.54] With confidence
[1469.54 → 1472.42] Knowing that we come in the name of Jesus
[1472.42 → 1473.64] Not on our own strength
[1473.64 → 1474.84] Not in our own merit
[1474.84 → 1478.42] But clinging only to the grace of Christ
[1478.42 → 1480.20] That is freely given to us
[1480.20 → 1482.12] Lord, we thank you for that gift
[1482.12 → 1484.96] And help us, Lord, to truly delight in you
[1484.96 → 1487.32] For the sake of Christ we pray
[1487.32 → 1487.76] Amen
[1487.76 → 1491.76] Now friends, hear the good news of Jesus Christ
[1491.76 → 1493.32] And what He has done for us
[1493.32 → 1494.58] In these words of grace
[1494.58 → 1497.16] The Bible tells us this
[1497.16 → 1499.82] For God demonstrates His own love for us
[1499.82 → 1500.28] In this
[1500.28 → 1502.20] While we were still sinners
[1502.20 → 1505.04] Christ died for us
[1505.04 → 1507.86] All the prophets testify about Him
[1507.86 → 1510.72] That everyone who believes in Him
[1510.72 → 1512.78] Receives forgiveness of sins
[1512.78 → 1514.32] Through His name
[1514.32 → 1517.66] To all who humbly seek the mercy of God
[1517.66 → 1518.56] I say to you
[1518.56 → 1520.04] That in Christ Jesus
[1520.04 → 1522.18] Your sins are forgiven
[1522.18 → 1523.92] Thanks be to God
[1523.92 → 1526.06] Let's stand and let's respond
[1526.06 → 1527.22] To God's love and mercy
[1527.22 → 1528.18] By singing the song
[1528.18 → 1529.12] Refiner's Fire
[1529.12 → 1545.38] Purify my heart
[1545.38 → 1549.28] Let me be as gold
[1549.28 → 1552.86] In precious silver
[1552.86 → 1557.02] Purify my heart
[1557.02 → 1560.80] Let me be as gold
[1560.80 → 1564.80] Pure gold
[1564.80 → 1569.18] Refiner's Fire
[1569.18 → 1574.58] My heart's one desire
[1574.58 → 1580.58] Is to be holy
[1580.58 → 1585.82] Set apart for you
[1585.82 → 1586.84] Lord
[1586.84 → 1592.12] I choose to be holy
[1592.12 → 1597.32] Set apart for you
[1597.32 → 1599.06] To my master
[1599.06 → 1603.32] Ready to do your will
[1603.32 → 1623.66] Purify my heart
[1623.66 → 1626.40] Cleanse me from within
[1626.40 → 1631.10] And make me holy
[1631.10 → 1635.20] Purify my heart
[1635.20 → 1639.42] Cleanse me from my sin
[1639.42 → 1642.00] Deep within
[1642.00 → 1647.00] We find His fire
[1647.00 → 1651.66] My heart's one desire
[1651.66 → 1657.66] Is to be holy
[1657.66 → 1662.66] Set apart for you
[1662.66 → 1665.66] I choose to be holy
[1665.66 → 1670.66] Set apart for you
[1670.66 → 1674.66] Set apart for you
[1674.66 → 1675.66] Lord
[1675.66 → 1676.66] My master
[1676.66 → 1677.66] Ready to do your will
[1677.66 → 1681.66] Ready to do your will
[1681.66 → 1686.66] We find His fire
[1686.66 → 1691.66] Our heart's one desire
[1691.66 → 1695.66] Is to be holy
[1695.66 → 1702.66] Set apart for you
[1702.66 → 1703.66] For you Lord
[1703.66 → 1704.66] I choose to be holy
[1704.66 → 1709.66] I choose to be holy
[1709.66 → 1713.66] Set apart for you
[1713.66 → 1715.66] Set apart for you
[1715.66 → 1716.66] My master
[1716.66 → 1720.66] Ready to do your will
[1720.66 → 1723.66] Ready to do your will
[1723.66 → 1725.66] Ready to do your will
[1725.66 → 1728.66] For you
[1728.66 → 1731.66] Це
[1731.66 → 1732.70] order
[1732.70 → 1747.66] MIT
[1747.66 → 1755.64] your life
[1755.64 → 1758.22] As we partake, thanks.
[1759.20 → 1761.76] So this morning, as we partake in this Lord's Supper,
[1762.80 → 1766.80] Jesus invites coming to him in faith.
[1767.84 → 1768.96] Now, what does that mean?
[1770.12 → 1774.78] What that means is that if you are someone who, by God's grace,
[1774.88 → 1778.78] you know in your heart that, yes, I belong to Jesus,
[1779.54 → 1781.16] that, yes, I believe in him,
[1781.48 → 1785.52] even though, honestly, sometimes I don't fully understand everything.
[1786.42 → 1793.24] Or I don't always understand how the gospel is really supposed to impact every area of my life.
[1793.76 → 1796.64] I don't know, but I trust him.
[1797.96 → 1802.94] And in entrusting him, I have signified that by being baptized,
[1803.18 → 1804.96] to become part of his church.
[1805.20 → 1807.00] And if that is you this morning,
[1807.78 → 1811.40] then this is for you to partake in by faith,
[1811.50 → 1813.18] saying, Jesus, I don't fully get it,
[1813.18 → 1815.98] but I know enough that you have died for me,
[1816.14 → 1818.36] that you have rose again for me,
[1818.44 → 1819.40] that I need a saviour.
[1820.52 → 1824.16] And that you are the only one who can atone for my sin.
[1825.02 → 1827.08] And you proved it through the resurrection,
[1827.74 → 1829.02] your resurrection from the dead.
[1830.90 → 1831.46] If you,
[1832.22 → 1833.90] if that's not you this morning,
[1834.06 → 1835.14] you know if you're more like,
[1835.24 → 1837.10] you know, yeah, I'm interested in Jesus,
[1837.10 → 1838.94] but I don't really yet trust him.
[1839.76 → 1840.86] Or if,
[1841.28 → 1842.92] even if you're beginning to trust him,
[1842.96 → 1844.30] but you haven't yet been baptized,
[1845.14 → 1847.38] then this meal is not yet for you.
[1848.02 → 1850.86] But I do invite you to take this time
[1850.86 → 1852.94] to come before God in prayer
[1852.94 → 1855.86] and ask him to give you the faith
[1855.86 → 1856.94] to truly believe
[1856.94 → 1858.94] and to trust in him,
[1859.16 → 1860.76] to trust in Jesus for salvation.
[1861.48 → 1863.44] Now for you parents with children,
[1863.86 → 1865.84] we leave it up to your discernment
[1865.84 → 1868.40] to whether or not your child
[1868.40 → 1872.04] can partake in an age-appropriate level of faith.
[1872.16 → 1873.82] Of course, they don't have all the answers either.
[1874.36 → 1875.64] But if they have been baptized
[1875.64 → 1878.34] and if they trust in Christ
[1878.34 → 1880.54] to the ability that they're able to,
[1880.54 → 1882.10] then they are also welcome
[1882.10 → 1883.06] according to your,
[1883.62 → 1884.70] what you think is best.
[1886.68 → 1888.54] So let's hear these words
[1888.54 → 1890.94] of the institution of the Lord's Supper
[1890.94 → 1891.92] from our Lord Jesus.
[1892.60 → 1893.28] The Lord Jesus,
[1893.44 → 1894.68] on the night when he was betrayed,
[1894.82 → 1895.48] he took bread.
[1896.08 → 1897.24] And when he had given thanks,
[1897.28 → 1898.00] he broke it.
[1898.76 → 1899.16] And he said,
[1899.24 → 1900.00] this is my body,
[1900.08 → 1901.04] which is for you.
[1901.82 → 1904.20] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1905.38 → 1906.28] The same way,
[1906.66 → 1907.14] also,
[1907.38 → 1909.28] he took the cup after supper,
[1909.28 → 1909.74] saying,
[1909.74 → 1910.80] this cup
[1910.80 → 1912.56] is the new covenant
[1912.56 → 1914.20] in my blood.
[1914.86 → 1916.88] For as often as you drink it,
[1917.44 → 1919.14] do it in remembrance of me.
[1919.22 → 1919.88] For as often
[1919.88 → 1921.34] as you eat this bread
[1921.34 → 1922.30] and drink this cup,
[1922.36 → 1924.04] you proclaim the Lord's death
[1924.04 → 1926.48] until he comes again.
[1928.30 → 1928.74] And so,
[1928.90 → 1931.08] let's say our words
[1931.08 → 1932.26] of the liturgy together.
[1933.30 → 1934.68] Brothers and sisters,
[1934.90 → 1936.04] lift your hearts.
[1936.70 → 1938.74] Lift your hearts.
[1938.74 → 1940.46] We are his people.
[1941.26 → 1942.34] We are the king
[1942.34 → 1943.62] by his grace.
[1944.26 → 1945.26] Let us proclaim
[1945.26 → 1947.04] the mystery of faith.
[1947.96 → 1949.02] Christ has died.
[1949.52 → 1950.58] Christ is risen.
[1951.16 → 1952.78] Christ will come again.
[1953.38 → 1954.46] Christ, our Passover,
[1954.86 → 1955.70] has been sacrificed
[1955.70 → 1956.84] for us.
[1957.14 → 1957.50] Hallelujah.
[1958.28 → 1958.88] Hallelujah.
[1959.52 → 1960.30] Brothers and sisters,
[1960.42 → 1962.22] these are the gifts of God
[1962.22 → 1962.66] for you,
[1962.74 → 1963.30] his people.
[1963.30 → 1964.98] So take them
[1964.98 → 1967.54] and feed on Christ
[1967.54 → 1968.46] by faith
[1968.46 → 1970.58] with Thanksgiving,
[1971.20 → 1972.06] knowing and trusting
[1972.06 → 1973.48] that he died
[1973.48 → 1974.22] to forgive you
[1974.22 → 1975.48] of all of your sins.
[1976.52 → 1976.70] Now,
[1976.76 → 1977.64] can I ask the
[1977.82 → 1978.20] our elders
[1978.20 → 1979.00] who are serving
[1979.00 → 1979.74] to come forward
[1979.74 → 1980.94] and help me distribute
[1980.94 → 1981.66] the elements.
[1982.38 → 1982.56] And,
[1982.70 → 1983.36] and while
[1983.36 → 1984.88] the elders are distributing
[1984.88 → 1985.40] the elements,
[1985.52 → 1985.68] again,
[1985.74 → 1986.78] this is just a time
[1986.78 → 1987.68] to,
[1987.78 → 1988.46] to pray,
[1988.62 → 1989.08] to meditate
[1989.08 → 1990.60] on who Christ is
[1990.60 → 1991.54] and what he has done
[1991.54 → 1991.94] for you.
[1991.94 → 1992.34] Amen.
[2019.08 → 2020.08] Amen.
[2049.08 → 2050.08] Amen.

[2249.12 → 2250.16] Amen.
[2250.16 → 2250.82] Amen.
[2250.82 → 2251.36] Amen.
[2251.36 → 2252.24] Amen.
[2254.24 → 2254.50] Amen.
[2258.46 → 2258.80] Amen.
[2258.80 → 2288.78] Thank you.
[2288.80 → 2318.78] Thank you.
[2318.80 → 2348.78] Thank you.
[2348.80 → 2378.78] Thank you.
[2378.80 → 2408.78] Thank you.
[2408.80 → 2438.78] Thank you.
[2438.80 → 2468.78] Thank you.
[2468.80 → 2498.78] Thank you.
[2498.78 → 2528.76] Thank you.
[2528.76 → 2530.76] Thank you.
[2558.76 → 2588.74] Thank you.
[2588.76 → 2618.74] Thank you.
[2618.76 → 2648.74] Thank you.
[2648.74 → 2678.72] Thank you.
[2678.72 → 2708.70] Thank you.
[2708.70 → 2738.68] Thank you.
[2738.70 → 2768.68] Thank you.
[2768.70 → 2798.68] Thank you.
[2798.68 → 2828.66] Thank you.
[2829.48 → 2858.66] Well, you'll learn a new song.
[2858.66 → 2888.64] Thank you.
[2888.66 → 2918.64] Thank you.
[2918.66 → 2948.64] Thank you.
[2948.64 → 2978.62] All right.
[2978.62 → 3008.60] So, Acts 17.
[3008.60 → 3038.58] On 2, 6.
[3038.58 → 3046.26] up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city.
[3046.96 → 3054.44] They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
[3055.52 → 3060.96] But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city
[3060.96 → 3068.66] officials, shouting, these men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,
[3069.28 → 3075.84] and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees,
[3076.32 → 3085.14] saying that there is another king, one called Jesus. When they heard this, the crowd and the
[3085.14 → 3092.40] city officials were thrown into turmoil. Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
[3093.52 → 3101.44] As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there,
[3101.60 → 3111.50] they went to the Jewish synagogue. Now the Berman Jews were of more noble character than those in
[3111.50 → 3118.36] Thessalonica. For they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every
[3118.36 → 3127.56] day to see if what Paul said was true. As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of
[3127.56 → 3133.40] prominent Greek women and many Greek men. This is the word of the Lord.
[3135.46 → 3139.74] Let us pray and ask for God's blessing upon his word. Let's pray together.
[3141.50 → 3151.66] Our Father, we know that every good and perfect gift comes from you, whether it's your word,
[3152.34 → 3160.54] whether the spirit, whether Jesus, and whether the ability to hear your word and to respond in faith and
[3160.54 → 3168.20] trust. And so we pray that your spirit would accompany your word now, that we might listen as
[3168.20 → 3174.84] though we are listening to the very words of God, with the same spirit as the Berea ns,
[3175.70 → 3180.38] and with joy in our hearts. For Jesus' sake, we pray. Amen.
[3180.38 → 3195.06] So every year on April 1st, better known as what? April Fool's Day. Yes. My kids start to plan some
[3195.06 → 3202.36] sort of trick that they're going to do on each other. But it is not just kids who enjoy this kind
[3202.36 → 3211.88] of mischief, of playing tricks on others. Newspapers, companies, the government, everyone gets in on this,
[3211.88 → 3218.34] and they write these incredible articles. So I have a photo to put up there. Several years ago,
[3218.34 → 3226.88] I read an article with this title, Vancouver to become new BC capital. And I just read it like a
[3226.88 → 3233.94] normal news story. You know, it was only a couple of years here, or so what do I know? You know,
[3233.96 → 3239.38] they talked about using the Vancouver Art Gallery as the government building. And they had these
[3239.38 → 3244.78] artist sketches. If you read the article, there's all of these diagrams, artistic sketches of what
[3244.78 → 3251.10] it's going to look like. There was a timeline, a plan, finances, it was all there. All of these
[3251.10 → 3259.28] details, right? And it made it sound so convincing. I was relieved. I believed it. So a couple of days later,
[3259.28 → 3265.54] I was talking with a pastor from Victoria. And I said, well, I told him about it. He said,
[3265.54 → 3273.20] I didn't hear anything about that. That would be terrible. And then he asked me, are you sure?
[3273.20 → 3280.68] So I went back, I found the article, I looked at it again, and I realized it was an April Fool's joke.
[3281.74 → 3288.98] And so I had to admit, it got me. I thought it was true. And I felt pretty embarrassed.
[3290.30 → 3295.70] But, you know, it's all done in good fun. It's okay. And then, you know, every year you see these
[3295.70 → 3302.22] things. It's really creative stuff. I won't spend a lot of time going through them. But it did occur to me,
[3302.22 → 3311.68] though, that sometimes we are more gullible than others. Sometimes we pay a little more attention
[3311.68 → 3320.72] than other times. And perhaps that we're at our best when it comes to listening well on April Fool's.
[3321.72 → 3330.92] We ask, is this really true? What are they up to here? And it's that quality of listening
[3330.92 → 3337.78] that we see here in our passage this morning when Paul preaches to the town of Berea.
[3338.70 → 3343.82] It says about the Berea ns that they received the message with great eagerness
[3343.82 → 3351.70] and examined the scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
[3351.70 → 3361.16] That is attentive listening. But that is not the only response that Paul's preaching that we see in our
[3361.16 → 3367.92] passage today. There was a mixed response. And we see this actually throughout the Bible. We've seen it
[3367.92 → 3374.20] several times already in the book of Acts. But in the Gospels, Jesus, he tells the parable of the sower.
[3374.20 → 3383.78] However, the word is sown. And for some, it bears fruit 30, 60, 100-fold. For some, it seems like it
[3383.78 → 3389.84] bears fruit, but then it withers and dies. For others, the seed doesn't even penetrate the soil.
[3391.20 → 3396.74] But before we focus our attention on the different responses that we see here in Acts, let's look at
[3396.74 → 3403.98] first what's happening in the narrative. So Paul and Silas are passing through various cities. They're on
[3403.98 → 3411.12] their second missionary journey. They have just left Philippi, where we saw the last few weeks, we saw the
[3411.12 → 3418.38] conversions of Lydia, the slave girl, and the Philippian jailer. So now they come to another prominent
[3418.38 → 3426.70] city in the region of Macedonia, the city of Thessalonica. They arrive, and the first thing they do
[3426.70 → 3434.66] is they go to the most strategic place possible for the receiving of the preaching of the word, and that
[3434.66 → 3440.90] is the local Jewish synagogue. And if that there is not a synagogue, as in the case of Philippi,
[3441.32 → 3447.52] they find devout women who are praying. So let's take a look at verse two in our passage.
[3448.32 → 3456.56] As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days, right, Saturdays for the Jews,
[3456.70 → 3462.84] he reasoned with them from the scriptures. How did he reason with them?
[3465.26 → 3476.28] Did he tell stories? Did he share his opinion? No, it says he would reason with them from the scriptures.
[3476.28 → 3484.84] Now, this is not the Bible that you might have in your hands right now. This is the Tanaka, the Hebrew Bible,
[3485.00 → 3492.70] Genesis to Malachi, and he would reason from those scriptures about Jesus, the Messiah.
[3494.44 → 3502.94] And what would he say? Verse three, he said, explaining, reasoning, explaining and proving that the Messiah
[3502.94 → 3510.34] has to suffer and then rise from the dead. This Jesus I'm proclaiming to you is the Messiah, he said.
[3511.12 → 3517.86] Right? Reasoning from the scriptures. So Paul would read the scriptures, and he would talk about how the law,
[3518.36 → 3523.98] the prophets, the writings, what we call the Old Testament, how it all pointed forward to Jesus,
[3523.98 → 3532.86] to his life, his death, his resurrection, that he is the Messiah, he is the Saviour. That was Paul's message.
[3534.18 → 3543.38] So what was the response? Well, in our passage, in Acts 17, we see at least four different responses that I want us to look at.
[3543.72 → 3550.18] Four different ways of listening. And we're going to start, we're going to go from the worst,
[3550.18 → 3557.48] the least listening to the best, okay, from the worst to the best. And we're going to look at each of these.
[3557.68 → 3564.40] So first, the first one we see is indifference. Indifference. There were some who were just plain
[3564.40 → 3570.28] indifferent to the preaching of the word. They didn't really care. Look at verse four.
[3571.18 → 3577.90] It says, some of the Jews were persuaded, and they joined Paul and Silas, as did many
[3577.90 → 3584.66] God-fearing Greeks, and quite a few prominent women. So it said, some were persuaded, but I think that
[3584.66 → 3593.08] implies there were others who were not persuaded. Some were persuaded, others were not, it implies.
[3594.26 → 3603.62] They were kind of indifferent. The seed fell, the word fell, but they just got on with the rest of their lives.
[3603.62 → 3612.12] Now, why weren't they persuaded? I think it's because Paul goes into the synagogue, and what does he say?
[3612.62 → 3619.96] He says the very opposite of what they wanted to hear. These Jewish people are awaiting a Messiah
[3619.96 → 3625.10] that will bring them glory and honour, that will conquer their enemies, that will restore them
[3625.10 → 3637.98] to the land, much like still today. And here comes Paul, and he preaches a Messiah who instead would suffer
[3637.98 → 3645.70] and die. And so they are Jewish people who have read the scriptures, they have memorized the scriptures,
[3646.04 → 3650.70] they supposedly love the scriptures, they can know all of this stuff about the Old Testament,
[3650.70 → 3657.00] and yet when it comes to the suffering of the Messiah, the death of the Messiah, they simply would not
[3657.00 → 3667.12] believe it. And that is amazing to me, and also a bit frightening. It's amazing that we will believe
[3667.12 → 3676.44] what we want to believe. We will convince ourselves of what we wish to be true, what we want to believe.
[3676.44 → 3685.26] And this happens to many people in our world who are just entirely indifferent to the gospel, right?
[3685.28 → 3690.94] They have their own ideas about life and about the way the world should work. And so when they hear the
[3690.94 → 3698.48] gospel about this person Jesus, how he is the Lord, and he came to die for your sins to be your saviour,
[3699.20 → 3706.38] that doesn't align with what they already believe. So they don't listen. They say, so what?
[3706.44 → 3715.82] About God and about his word. And so friends, if that is you today, I would encourage you to take this
[3715.82 → 3723.22] seriously. To recognize that this is a serious spiritual condition where, as 2 Corinthians 4 says,
[3723.32 → 3729.48] you have been blinded to the glories of Christ in the gospel. But if you are hearing God's word,
[3729.48 → 3738.58] and it is stirring your heart in some way, then be attentive to that. Don't rob yourself of what God is saying to you.
[3739.44 → 3745.12] You can open your heart, you can open your mind to what God is saying to you in his word.
[3746.20 → 3754.18] Okay, so that's the first. Some are indifferent. The second response we see is that, is the response of resistance.
[3754.18 → 3763.46] Okay, some resist the word. So what happened? As Paul is preaching, right, that it's necessary that the
[3763.46 → 3771.86] Christ must suffer and die for you, some of them are angry, right? They feel like their world that they
[3771.86 → 3778.96] have built up in their own beliefs is being destabilized. And they want to try and silence
[3778.96 → 3788.24] Paul and Silas. And so they form a mob, and they set the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason's
[3788.24 → 3795.40] house. Poor Jason. I don't know who, we don't know who this Jason is. Jason is in the Bible, Acts 17.
[3796.46 → 3802.16] So, but it seems like Paul and Silas were staying at Jason's house. He's just a believer in the city.
[3802.16 → 3808.28] So the mob, they go to Jason's house. They don't find Paul and Silas there. So they drag Jason out
[3808.28 → 3813.10] with some of the other believers, and they bring them to the city authorities. And then notice what
[3813.10 → 3818.62] it says, speaking about Paul and Silas and the Christians. They say this in verse 6.
[3819.98 → 3826.86] These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, and Jason has welcomed
[3826.86 → 3834.40] them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there's another king, one
[3834.40 → 3842.66] called Jesus, right? They can't reason back with Paul, because what Paul said is irrefutable.
[3843.24 → 3848.22] They don't actually have an argument based on scripture. So what do they do? They become violent.
[3849.00 → 3855.00] They cause a major uproar. They accuse Paul and Silas of causing trouble, of doing the very
[3855.00 → 3863.12] thing that they have just done. And that's what wicked people do. Now, by the way, has Paul
[3863.12 → 3870.40] caused trouble all over the world? Well, all he did was teach. But he was teaching things
[3870.40 → 3878.54] that people didn't want to hear. Are they defying Caesar's decrees? No, that's not true.
[3878.54 → 3887.00] Are they saying that there is another king, one called Jesus? Yes. Right? That is exactly
[3887.00 → 3894.60] what Paul and Silas were doing. They were saying that Jesus is Lord. He is king. But they were not
[3894.60 → 3901.54] doing it in the way that they meant by it. Because Christianity is not anti-Caesar. Right? Christianity
[3901.54 → 3908.16] is not anti-government. Christianity is pro-government in the sense that we live quiet and peaceable
[3908.16 → 3914.62] lives. We pay our taxes. We obey the law. Furthermore, we don't cause uproars. And yet that's what
[3914.62 → 3922.64] they try to accuse Paul and Silas of doing. Now, some of us may think that when we look
[3922.64 → 3929.08] at these two responses, indifference to the gospel, don't care, or this angry resistance,
[3929.48 → 3935.84] we might think that actually resistance to the gospel is the worst response. But actually,
[3935.84 → 3941.46] I don't think so. Because for these Jewish men who are causing an uproar in the city,
[3941.96 → 3948.02] at least we can say this much about them, they actually listened. Right? They listened
[3948.02 → 3956.68] well enough to at least get angry about what they heard. And that is much better. Much better
[3956.68 → 3962.00] than someone who just comes to church and doesn't really listen to a word that you say. Much better
[3962.00 → 3970.60] to be angry than to be indifferent. Because God's word here is getting them riled up. It's pushing
[3970.60 → 3976.28] their buttons. It's cutting close to the bone. Furthermore, it's penetrating something. And sometimes those
[3976.28 → 3982.88] who initially just resist and they kind of rage against God's word, they might look like they're
[3982.88 → 3989.28] miles away, but actually they are so close. They're so close. There's some people who will fight and will
[3989.28 → 3996.60] argue, but they're pursuing the truth. And they are closer to God. And sometimes they just then will
[3996.60 → 4003.44] step over that line and they will believe. Because God's word is at work in their hearts.
[4005.24 → 4012.02] God converts angry people. I'm not so sure if he always does with indifferent people.
[4012.02 → 4019.70] God converts angry people. So now the third response we see is that some are persuaded. Right? Some people
[4019.70 → 4028.04] believe. And we see that again back in verse 4. Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas.
[4028.94 → 4036.82] So you can imagine, right, Paul in the Jewish synagogue, Sabbath after Sabbath, opening the scriptures,
[4036.82 → 4044.34] pointing, arguing, reading the scriptures, and then at the end of that time, they say,
[4045.14 → 4052.64] yeah, all right, that makes sense. Okay? It's very undramatic. Right? It kind of seems like
[4052.64 → 4056.70] it's stated here so simply. Some of the Jews were persuaded.
[4056.70 → 4064.00] And, you know, some conversions are like that. Right? You'll, you know, on the one hand, you get Paul
[4064.00 → 4070.08] on the road to Damascus, falling off his horse. He can't see. He's blinded. Furthermore, he needs to be cared by
[4070.08 → 4076.42] Christians for days because Christ appeared to him. Others, they hear the gospel, and they say,
[4076.98 → 4083.74] yeah, I believe what you're saying. And they put their faith in Jesus. And then as the months go on,
[4083.74 → 4088.80] the years go on, you start to see this incredible transformation in their lives.
[4089.62 → 4096.96] Right? You start to see this new heart, this new life that emerges and blossoms. And that's what's
[4096.96 → 4105.50] happening here. They're persuaded. It seems undramatic, but look at how Paul describes what happens to them
[4105.50 → 4114.36] when he writes back to the church in the letter that he writes 1 Thessalonians. So in 1 Thessalonians
[4114.36 → 4120.80] chapter 1 verse 5, Paul is writing to this church that is being planted here in Acts 17. He writes this.
[4121.92 → 4129.66] He says, our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit,
[4129.66 → 4138.62] with deep conviction. You know, and when we read 1 Thessalonians, we're like, whoa, man, these people,
[4138.72 → 4145.24] you know, they must have gone through something so dramatic. But when you read Acts, some people
[4145.24 → 4152.18] believed or some people were persuaded. That's it. Now, but why? Why did they believe? Why were they
[4152.18 → 4161.68] persuaded? It's because they did receive the word of God. So 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 says this.
[4162.44 → 4171.32] Paul says, we also thank God continually because when you received the word of God, which you heard
[4171.32 → 4179.10] from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is the word of God, which is indeed at
[4179.10 → 4190.82] work in you who believe. It's amazing. So some were indifferent to the word. Some were resistant
[4190.82 → 4198.34] to the word. And then some were persuaded and they believed. But there is a final response. The best
[4198.34 → 4205.00] one, I think, that we're meant to see here. And that is the response of noble listening. Okay,
[4205.00 → 4210.60] the response of noble listening. So what happens is this. After some of the Jews in Thessalonica,
[4210.68 → 4216.26] they stir up the crowd, they cause a riot. The believers say, Paul and Silas, you guys, time to go.
[4216.84 → 4224.62] So they send them away to Berea. And we are told immediately these Jews in Berea, as opposed to the
[4224.62 → 4235.02] ones in Thessalonica, were more noble. God here pays them the highest compliment that you can,
[4235.64 → 4244.20] could be paid to any listener of the word of God. It says they were noble. Now why is that?
[4244.96 → 4250.04] It's because of the way in which they received the word. Okay, so let's look at verse 11.
[4250.04 → 4261.04] Now the Berman Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica. Why? For they received
[4261.04 → 4266.30] the message with great eagerness. They examined the scriptures every day to see if what Paul said
[4266.30 → 4274.40] was true. How did they receive the word? Eagerly. Right? That is, they were excited to receive the word.
[4274.48 → 4279.20] It was the word of God. There's this eagerness, a hunger, and thirsting after righteousness.
[4280.04 → 4286.84] And so when Paul comes, and he preaches the word, they are, have his attention. Right? They're not just
[4286.84 → 4294.42] sitting there going, when's this going to be over? Hint, hint. Just kidding. But they're, they're not just
[4294.42 → 4301.96] doing their duty. They're eager. They're listening attentively. And of course, their noble character
[4301.96 → 4308.80] is because when Paul preached, not only did they, it says, receive the message with great eagerness,
[4308.80 → 4316.16] but they also examined the scriptures. They, they were making sure that what he said was true.
[4317.02 → 4321.54] And so they go back. How do they make sure it's true? They go back to the scriptures.
[4322.34 → 4328.82] They look at what God says. They didn't just take what Paul said for granted, just kind of like blindly
[4328.82 → 4334.50] just listening to whatever he said and accepting it, nor did they just dismiss it out of hand because
[4334.50 → 4341.50] it doesn't align with what they already believed. But they asked, is what Paul is saying consistent
[4341.50 → 4346.54] with what the scriptures teach? That's all that matters to them at the end of the day.
[4346.54 → 4357.46] And this is precisely Luke's point, right? That nobility in the eyes of God is not about just holding on to what
[4357.46 → 4366.64] you've always believed, not being willing to be challenged or to change. And it has nothing to do,
[4366.70 → 4372.52] on the other hand, with staying true to yourself as our culture would often preach to us today.
[4372.52 → 4378.52] Being noble in the eyes of God is listening to what God is actually saying.
[4379.96 → 4386.52] God calls the Berea ns noble of character because they loved the truth of God's word most.
[4387.52 → 4395.24] They were willing to learn, grow, change, understand what God was saying when it aligned with the word of God.
[4396.34 → 4399.54] And friends, that's who we are called to be as followers of Christ.
[4399.54 → 4402.06] We are called to be people of the book.
[4403.94 → 4408.90] And so the gospel, friends, when it is faithfully preached, will always lead to a response.
[4409.74 → 4414.78] And we've seen these four responses, the responses of indifference, of resistance, of persuasion,
[4415.18 → 4416.28] and then of noble listening.
[4417.48 → 4421.86] And now as we conclude, I just want to take something of what we've been talking about
[4421.86 → 4428.46] and kind of bring it home in just as really this one main point by way of application.
[4429.46 → 4433.40] And that is to think about together, how should we listen to a sermon?
[4434.16 → 4436.08] Now this isn't just self-serving, okay?
[4436.26 → 4438.58] I think that is the application of this passage.
[4438.70 → 4440.82] How should we listen to a sermon?
[4440.82 → 4447.08] Listen, when we come to church, it's not going to a lecture.
[4448.66 → 4455.10] Okay, when you go to a lecture, you go, and you take notes so that you can be ready for the examination,
[4455.28 → 4456.28] and that's why you're there.
[4457.02 → 4458.42] Now I'm not saying you shouldn't take notes.
[4458.46 → 4460.12] It could be a helpful way to listen.
[4461.02 → 4464.08] But you're here to worship the true and living God.
[4464.08 → 4470.48] And the point is that when the word of God is preached, God is speaking to you.
[4470.76 → 4471.62] That's what it means.
[4472.74 → 4478.52] God is speaking to you because it's an exposition of the word of God in the Bible.
[4479.56 → 4482.86] And the Holy Spirit accompanies the preaching of the word,
[4483.08 → 4489.22] and it applies that word to your heart and nourishes you with the word preached.
[4489.22 → 4497.40] And so when you come here on a Sunday to worship, you're coming to listen to the voice of God.
[4498.58 → 4504.56] And there's a relationship going on between God and his people where God is speaking to you,
[4504.90 → 4508.40] and you are listening, and you respond back.
[4509.78 → 4511.82] So here's something Martin Luther said.
[4513.10 → 4516.54] He said, yes, I hear the sermon, but who is speaking?
[4517.12 → 4517.74] The minister?
[4517.74 → 4519.22] No, indeed.
[4519.98 → 4521.44] You do not hear the minister.
[4522.20 → 4523.44] True, the voice is his.
[4524.02 → 4529.06] But my God is speaking the word that he preaches or speaks.
[4531.06 → 4537.22] And think about how then that changes your whole approach to Sunday worship.
[4538.26 → 4541.94] When you come to church, you're not coming to hear the preacher.
[4542.90 → 4547.02] You are coming to hear the voice of Christ through the preacher.
[4547.74 → 4553.04] And the degree to which you are attuned to that, to the voice of God speaking,
[4553.44 → 4556.78] is the degree to which you will be blessed by God in hearing.
[4556.78 → 4563.12] What if the preaching isn't faithful to the word of God?
[4563.24 → 4563.74] What do you do?
[4565.10 → 4565.54] Run.
[4567.26 → 4568.60] Find a different church.
[4569.06 → 4569.26] Okay?
[4569.56 → 4570.44] Run out the door.
[4570.66 → 4571.10] Don't stay.
[4571.10 → 4576.20] What if the preaching is faithful, but maybe not always that great?
[4576.80 → 4579.38] You ask for guest pastors to come occasionally.
[4580.18 → 4580.58] Just kidding.
[4581.14 → 4582.22] We do that, though, too.
[4583.26 → 4585.88] But what if the preaching is not that great?
[4586.02 → 4587.46] Well, you know what?
[4587.46 → 4589.60] That means God is giving you crumbs.
[4591.04 → 4597.44] But whether he gives you crumbs or whether he gives you a nice, big, juicy hamburger,
[4598.00 → 4599.74] that is God's business.
[4601.02 → 4603.86] But when you come here, don't rob yourself of a blessing
[4603.86 → 4608.28] because your heart has not come to expect to hear the voice of God.
[4608.28 → 4613.88] Don't fixate on the preacher, his style, content, delivery, all this stuff.
[4614.16 → 4614.66] No, just listen.
[4614.74 → 4618.38] What is God saying to you through his word?
[4619.52 → 4621.32] So here's a question I want us to think about.
[4622.02 → 4625.38] Are you growing in the quality of noble listening?
[4626.34 → 4630.26] Are you growing in your ability to listen well to the voice of God,
[4630.44 → 4631.84] to receive it eagerly,
[4631.84 → 4639.06] and to examine it to see if what it says is true by looking at the scriptures?
[4640.06 → 4642.70] On a very practical level, for example, again,
[4642.80 → 4649.14] do you come to this place thinking or talking about what you liked or didn't like about the sermon?
[4650.26 → 4652.18] Or the preacher's style of delivery?
[4652.98 → 4655.40] Or do you leave this place thinking and talking about
[4655.40 → 4659.42] what did God say to me today through his word?
[4659.42 → 4662.64] That's the question that we should be asking.
[4663.48 → 4667.98] And this is, again, where Jesus' own teaching on listening becomes so important
[4667.98 → 4670.06] because in the context of the parable of the sower,
[4670.66 → 4673.44] Jesus says these important words in Luke 8.
[4674.78 → 4675.40] He says,
[4675.52 → 4679.98] But the seed on good soil stands for those with a what?
[4681.06 → 4683.24] A noble and good heart
[4683.24 → 4686.58] who hear the word, retain it,
[4686.58 → 4689.10] and by persevering in the word, right,
[4689.10 → 4690.56] examining the scriptures daily,
[4691.68 → 4692.42] produce a crop.
[4695.54 → 4698.10] Now I want to end with a quote by Eugene Peterson.
[4699.40 → 4700.76] So it's a lovely quote.
[4700.86 → 4701.42] This is what he said.
[4701.48 → 4703.56] A little bit long, but let's look at it.
[4704.60 → 4706.58] Christians don't simply learn
[4706.58 → 4707.86] or study
[4707.86 → 4709.10] or use scripture.
[4709.76 → 4711.06] We assimilate it.
[4711.68 → 4713.28] Take it into our lives
[4713.28 → 4715.10] in such a way that it gets metabolized
[4715.10 → 4717.48] metabolized into acts of love,
[4718.14 → 4719.40] cups of cold water,
[4719.80 → 4721.38] missions into all the world,
[4721.82 → 4723.42] healing and evangelism
[4723.42 → 4725.40] and justice in Jesus' name,
[4725.86 → 4728.08] hands raised in adoration of the Father,
[4728.60 → 4730.16] feet washed in company
[4730.16 → 4731.84] with the Son.
[4731.84 → 4734.42] It's beautiful.
[4736.24 → 4737.52] That's what the word does
[4737.52 → 4739.16] when it produces a crop,
[4739.32 → 4741.62] 30, 60, 100-fold.
[4743.12 → 4743.34] Right?
[4743.42 → 4745.32] Listening is a skill that we can practice
[4745.32 → 4746.44] and we can grow in,
[4747.00 → 4748.56] but at first it begins
[4748.56 → 4750.52] with the disposition of the heart.
[4751.30 → 4753.24] Are we here to listen to God's word?
[4754.30 → 4755.54] And I want to encourage you
[4755.54 → 4757.60] to take his word into your life,
[4757.68 → 4759.02] wherever you are at this morning,
[4759.02 → 4760.96] to take his word into your life.
[4761.86 → 4763.32] And so let us ask God
[4763.32 → 4764.60] to speak to us
[4764.60 → 4766.54] and then to make his word
[4766.54 → 4768.04] come alive to us,
[4768.08 → 4769.16] to be fresh to us.
[4770.36 → 4771.10] So let's pray.
[4771.16 → 4771.94] Let me pray that God
[4771.94 → 4772.86] would do that for us.
[4774.50 → 4775.14] Our Father,
[4775.24 → 4776.44] we thank you for your word,
[4777.40 → 4778.82] your word which is true
[4778.82 → 4780.26] and that you give to us
[4780.26 → 4781.64] because you love us.
[4782.98 → 4784.74] We pray that we may come
[4784.74 → 4785.42] to your word
[4785.42 → 4787.24] not merely with passing attention,
[4787.24 → 4789.60] but in listening in a way
[4789.60 → 4790.60] that grips us
[4790.60 → 4792.42] at least to some measure
[4792.42 → 4793.82] each day.
[4794.96 → 4795.54] And Lord,
[4795.62 → 4796.26] would you help us
[4796.26 → 4797.50] to listen to your voice?
[4798.48 → 4799.70] We pray that as we listen
[4799.70 → 4800.76] that we would be blessed
[4800.76 → 4801.58] by you.
[4802.02 → 4803.08] We pray this for each
[4803.08 → 4804.40] and every one of us
[4804.40 → 4805.56] here this morning
[4805.56 → 4806.48] for Jesus' sake.
[4807.08 → 4807.48] Amen.
[4809.80 → 4810.28] All right,
[4810.32 → 4811.04] why don't we stand
[4811.04 → 4812.32] and let's sing
[4812.32 → 4813.30] a song of response.
[4813.58 → 4814.58] Speak, O Lord.
[4815.02 → 4815.58] Let's stand
[4815.58 → 4816.34] and let's sing together.
[4816.34 → 4817.34] Amen.
[4846.34 → 4848.34] Amen.
[4876.34 → 4878.34] Amen.
[4906.34 → 4908.34] Amen.
[4936.34 → 4938.34] Amen.
[4966.34 → 4968.34] Amen.
[4996.34 → 4998.34] Amen.
[5026.34 → 5028.34] Amen.
[5056.96 → 5060.64] We do that in order to support the work of our church and the ministry of God around
[5060.64 → 5061.14] the world.
[5061.32 → 5066.94] If you are a visitor today or not yet a believer, please do not feel compelled to give.
[5067.24 → 5073.00] But if you are a believer, if this is your home church, then please give in relation
[5073.00 → 5076.06] to the gratitude that you have to God.
[5076.96 → 5079.98] So our designated offering today is reframed ministries.
[5080.14 → 5081.02] You can read about there.
[5081.16 → 5082.66] It's a ministry of our denomination.
[5082.66 → 5089.66] So may I ask our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[5112.66 → 5142.64] So may I ask our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[5142.66 → 5172.64] So may I ask our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.

[5214.64 → 5220.64] So may I ask our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[5220.64 → 5225.06] Well, I hope he will not only listen to the word, but that music.
[5225.22 → 5226.72] That was very nice.
[5227.18 → 5228.10] It's amazing piano playing.
[5229.44 → 5234.74] So let's go to the Lord in a prayer of supplication, bringing our needs before him.
[5234.74 → 5236.82] Please pray with me.
[5236.82 → 5244.52] Father, we come before you as a people in need of you.
[5245.62 → 5250.48] For you are our dwelling place, our refuge, and our fortress.
[5250.48 → 5255.06] You are our God in whom we trust.
[5256.18 → 5262.82] We know that you have invited us to cast all of our anxieties on you because you care for us.
[5263.76 → 5271.98] And we know that your son, Jesus Christ, who gave himself as a ransom for all, acts as our mediator before you.
[5271.98 → 5276.82] So today, Lord, we lift our church to you.
[5276.94 → 5278.72] Lord, we pray for your church.
[5279.78 → 5283.04] And we need to spend time doing that, to pray for our church.
[5283.82 → 5289.32] We ask that you would make us a church that listens to your word above all else.
[5290.38 → 5294.86] We pray for the sanctifying work of your spirit in and among us, your people.
[5294.86 → 5303.08] We ask that you would more and more conform each of us into the image of your son.
[5304.38 → 5306.12] Lord, apply your word.
[5306.78 → 5309.96] Apply the gospel to every area of our lives.
[5310.54 → 5314.80] That we might shine forth your glory in the world.
[5316.46 → 5323.06] And Father, we also pray this morning not only for our spiritual health and growth,
[5323.06 → 5329.08] but, Lord, for physical health and the physical needs of the members of our congregation.
[5329.48 → 5337.90] This morning, we specifically think of and pray for two of our most elder members of our congregation, Ted and Ali.
[5338.98 → 5346.36] Lord, as Ted is in the hospital and will be staying there and moving to a long-term care home,
[5347.02 → 5349.44] Lord, we pray for your grace and mercy upon him.
[5349.44 → 5353.50] And, Lord, we thank you that he is still in relatively good health
[5353.50 → 5359.86] and is able to be thankful for all that you've done in his life.
[5360.48 → 5362.34] We pray for Ali, Lord.
[5362.68 → 5365.88] She is home from the hospital but not in good health.
[5366.90 → 5368.64] Lord, we pray for your mercy upon her.
[5369.34 → 5374.18] We pray, Lord, for a heart that would be open and soft to you
[5374.18 → 5380.82] and that would trust in you in the midst of the hardship of getting old, as she always says.
[5381.64 → 5387.24] Lord, be with Tony, who also had a bit of an unhealthy turn
[5387.24 → 5389.92] and who is at home now and couldn't come to church today.
[5390.02 → 5391.60] Lord, be with Tony, wouldn't you?
[5393.02 → 5397.10] And, Lord, we pray that we would be a church, again, that proclaims Jesus
[5397.10 → 5398.48] in all that we say and do.
[5398.48 → 5403.26] Thank you for the gospel, which is the power of God to salvation for all who believe.
[5404.42 → 5408.24] And help us, Lord, to walk humbly with you, not in pride or self-sufficiency,
[5408.74 → 5411.32] but in humility and in trust.
[5412.06 → 5415.76] We pray all these things to you in the name for Lord Jesus Christ,
[5416.54 → 5419.88] who taught us to pray, saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[5420.04 → 5421.90] And the words will be on the screen if you need them.
[5422.20 → 5425.20] Praying together, our Father, who art in heaven,
[5425.20 → 5427.32] hallowed be your name.
[5428.08 → 5431.10] Your kingdom come, your will be done,
[5431.22 → 5433.24] on earth as it is in heaven.
[5434.06 → 5436.04] Give us today our daily bread,
[5436.56 → 5438.24] and forgive us our debts,
[5438.60 → 5440.82] as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[5441.32 → 5443.26] And lead us not into temptation,
[5443.90 → 5446.06] but deliver us from the evil one.
[5446.06 → 5449.08] For yours is the kingdom and the power
[5449.08 → 5452.00] and the glory now and forever.
[5452.62 → 5452.98] Amen.
[5452.98 → 5460.62] Please stand, and we will prepare to go out.
[5461.28 → 5464.00] And again, thank you for worshipping with us.
[5464.04 → 5466.70] And if you are new, and we'd love to get to know you,
[5466.76 → 5468.48] we welcome you to our church.
[5468.88 → 5470.48] Please join us, if you're able,
[5470.60 → 5472.04] for a time of fellowship and coffee,
[5472.18 → 5473.72] through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[5474.90 → 5476.48] And I invite you to hold out your hands
[5476.48 → 5478.22] as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5478.22 → 5481.62] May God himself, the God of peace,
[5481.80 → 5483.22] sanctify you through and through.
[5483.92 → 5485.92] And may your whole spirit, soul, and body
[5485.92 → 5489.34] be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5489.86 → 5492.22] The one who calls you is faithful,
[5492.96 → 5493.96] and he will do it.
[5494.56 → 5494.88] Amen.
[5494.88 → 5495.00] Amen.
[5498.70 → 5499.22] Amen.
[5499.30 → 5499.74] Amen.

[5510.00 → 5512.98] Amen.
[5514.48 → 5516.38] Amen.
[5516.38 → 5525.52] May you grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[5527.32 → 5538.38] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5538.38 → 5550.78] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.

[5589.50 → 5601.66] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
