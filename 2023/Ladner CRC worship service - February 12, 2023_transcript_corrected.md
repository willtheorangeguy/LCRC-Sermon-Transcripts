[3147.76 → 3177.74] And you're in the church.
[3177.74 → 3207.72] And you're in the church.
[3207.72 → 3237.70] And you're in the church.
[3237.70 → 3267.68] Christianity causes, and you're in the church.
[3267.68 → 3297.66] And you're in the church.
[3297.66 → 3306.56] but in his name in the name of religion and so you know we look at the Crusades we look at the
[3306.56 → 3313.00] religious wars throughout history and so it isn't surprising that non-religious people have wished
[3313.00 → 3318.88] that religious people would just get rid of their beliefs because then there'd be nothing left to
[3318.88 → 3327.94] fight for is that true well when John Lennon asked us to imagine no religion we don't have to imagine
[3327.94 → 3334.10] it does we right we've seen the kind of cultures that creates non-religious secular societies are
[3334.10 → 3340.42] also notorious for their violence and murderous behaviour we think about the Soviet Union when I
[3340.42 → 3344.74] was in elementary school we would have air raid drills where we have to practice hiding under
[3344.74 → 3352.12] the desk, or we think about maybe communist China and Mao's Red Guards going about destroying anything
[3352.12 → 3358.78] that represents Chinese history or culture or traditional values in killing anyone who wasn't
[3358.78 → 3367.60] just like them a revolutionary in the name of being anti-religious, so human violence shows up everywhere
[3367.60 → 3374.08] it shows up among religious people it shows up among non-religious people who claim they have no
[3374.08 → 3380.56] religion and friends that is why Jesus came he came, and he announced to us the good news he said repent
[3380.56 → 3393.70] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand something new has come Jesus came to show it to be a new human a
[3393.70 → 3401.20] restored human he came to show us what it means to be a human and how to live in a new way in harmony with
[3401.20 → 3410.74] one another, and he's talking about the power of God to meet ordinary broken peace destroying people like
[3410.74 → 3418.88] you and me in a radical way so that as we are grasped by this kingdom of God we become new people we can
[3418.88 → 3426.62] actually imagine a world of peace and so the seventh beatitude that we're looking at this morning it's about
[3426.62 → 3436.30] being a peacemaker and as we've been doing over the last weeks let's look at this beatitude in two parts
[3436.30 → 3442.04] it kind of naturally breaks into two parts blessed are the peacemakers and then secondly for they will
[3442.04 → 3448.20] be called children of God so let's look at this together and first let's consider this first part of
[3448.20 → 3454.16] the beatitude blessed are the peacemakers and know and to get at the heart of what this beatitude is all
[3454.16 → 3461.44] about we have to understand what is this peace that Jesus is talking about what kind of peace does Jesus
[3461.76 → 3472.16] have in mind for the world now for most people normally when we think about peace it usually refers either to
[3472.16 → 3482.16] the inner tranquility right so a peace of mind a feeling of peace or to an outward state where there's just an absence of war and
[3482.16 → 3490.56] conflict we're at peace so you might say I'm feeling pretty chill now I don't know if you will say that but
[3490.56 → 3497.60] some people might say I'm feeling pretty chill, or you know I have a sense of calm about this decision that
[3497.60 → 3505.12] I've made I'm at peace, or you know and that's inner peace, or we might say well we're not fighting there's no conflict
[3505.12 → 3512.64] so I guess we are at peace and the biblical concept of peace certainly does include those two things but
[3512.64 → 3519.76] in fact it goes much deeper and much wider in the Old Testament the Hebrew word for peace is shalom say
[3519.76 → 3532.00] it with me shalom the most basic meaning of shalom is completeness or wholeness shalom completeness
[3532.00 → 3540.96] wholeness so here's an example Job chapter 5 24 it's kind of very small obscure example but it
[3540.96 → 3549.04] gets you an idea of how the Bible uses this word peace says you shall know that your tent is at peace
[3549.04 → 3556.16] how can a tent be at peace well, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing so that's what it means
[3556.16 → 3563.60] Job says his tents are in a state of shalom because he counted his flock no animals are missing
[3564.48 → 3570.24] for you cow farmers I think you do this every morning is there shalom they're all there okay yes
[3571.60 → 3582.80] nothing missing completeness wholeness shalom can also refer to a person's well-being so we read in
[3582.80 → 3591.04] first Samuel 17 David ran to the battle lines, and he asked his brother how they were now we translated
[3591.04 → 3596.00] how they were, but the Hebrew word is just one word he asked them shalom right
[3599.12 → 3604.16] when David visited his brothers on the battlefield he asked how they were he asked their shalom their
[3604.16 → 3611.36] well-being and in the Middle East people still greet each other by saying Salem that how you say it
[3612.16 → 3620.32] anybody here Salem and that's the same meaning as shalom and in this greeting Salem it's wishing you
[3620.88 → 3627.28] all the goodness that is possible to be upon you all goodness may it be upon you
[3627.28 → 3636.88] you and it kind of makes saying hi seem a little lame when you can say shalom or Salem all the goodness
[3637.60 → 3646.56] upon you in your household and the core idea is that life is full of relationships is full of situations
[3647.44 → 3656.56] um and when anything is out of alignment when anything is missing your shalom breaks down
[3657.44 → 3666.24] life is no longer whole so it needs to be restored it needs to be restored in fact the basic meaning of
[3666.24 → 3676.00] shalom when it is used as a verb is to bring shalom to make peace literally it means to bring completeness
[3676.00 → 3684.08] or read to restore to wholeness so in the bible if your animal accidentally damages your neighbour's field
[3684.08 → 3691.52] you make peace you make peace you shalom them by giving them complete repayment for their loss
[3692.64 → 3699.28] you take what's missing, and you restore it to wholeness, and then it is in a state of shalom because you have
[3699.28 → 3708.56] made peace and when we look at the broader story of the bible we see that god created a good world
[3708.56 → 3717.28] where everything was shalom everything was complete everything was whole everything was well-ordered
[3717.84 → 3725.60] just as god intended it to be so shalom in the beginning involved harmony with god human beings in
[3725.60 → 3734.64] right relationship with their creator shalom involved harmony with our inner selves living as god created us
[3734.64 → 3741.12] to be in our hearts in our minds in our bodies as men women and children in the world shalom
[3742.48 → 3749.68] shalom involved harmony in our relationships with other human beings, and it involved harmony with the earth
[3750.88 → 3757.12] as we were made to be stewards of all creation, and we lived in harmony with the earth
[3757.12 → 3765.28] shalom and encompassed every dimension of life in god's world, and it's when we live in harmony with god's
[3765.28 → 3769.92] creational intentions that we experience shalom in our own lives
[3772.64 → 3778.80] but we didn't wake up in that world did we the bible tells us, and we know from experience
[3778.80 → 3789.04] that something has gone terribly wrong sin has disrupted shalom what happens when to Adam and eve the moment
[3789.04 → 3797.84] sin is introduced in the garden of Eden a wedge is pushed between them and they hurl insults at one
[3797.84 → 3805.52] another and a wedge was brought between god and humanity who then went to hide from god as if we could do that
[3805.52 → 3814.96] and this sin disrupted our desires it broke our bodies and creation itself was put under a curse
[3817.68 → 3824.40] the friends' god loves you the bible tells us that as well god loves you he loves this world, and he intends
[3824.40 → 3834.40] to restore the world to shalom he intends to make it whole again to bring peace to shalom all creation
[3834.40 → 3840.32] everything that's been destroyed and so the prophet Isaiah he looks forward to a future king the prince
[3840.32 → 3850.00] of what peace his reign would bring shalom and make right all wrongs and heal all that's been broken
[3851.28 → 3858.48] and of course that future king is jesus is the prince of peace and this is exactly why Jesus came into
[3858.48 → 3866.72] the world to make peace to restore shalom it was in his very birth announcement right on the night Jesus
[3866.72 → 3877.84] was born in an angelic army appeared to the shepherds a host of heaven that's an army it's military language
[3877.84 → 3883.68] and we might think okay now you know they're just going to whip this world into shape right but when the
[3883.68 → 3889.36] angels they broke through the veil of heaven, and they appeared arrayed in the field before the shepherds
[3889.36 → 3898.16] they didn't declare war what did they say in Luke chapter 2 verse 14 glory to god in the highest and
[3898.16 → 3907.60] on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests all right Jesus did not come into this world in judgment
[3907.60 → 3915.52] he came with love and forgiveness for his enemies we were his enemies we were the ones responsible for
[3915.52 → 3922.00] the mess that the world is in killing the world disrupting shalom damaging relationships hiding from god
[3923.76 → 3930.48] we can't make peace because of sin we can't make peace there's been however many thousands of years of
[3930.48 → 3939.60] human existence since the garden and there's still no peace but Jesus came into a broken world into a
[3939.60 → 3944.88] world that is unravelling at the seams into a world where shalom has been disrupted, and he comes and he
[3944.88 → 3953.04] says I will make peace I came to make peace and how did Jesus make peace for us through his blood on the
[3953.04 → 3963.60] cross Paul writes about this in Colossians chapter 1 he says for god was pleased to have all his fullness dwell
[3963.60 → 3970.56] in Christ and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven
[3971.36 → 3980.48] how by making peace through his bloodshed on a cross Jesus came into the world to establish peace
[3980.48 → 3988.08] to make shalom to make whole all that is broken, and he did it by taking all the brokenness of the world
[3988.08 → 3998.00] all the brokenness of our lives onto himself on the cross the prophet Isaiah says this
[3999.28 → 4006.24] but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought
[4006.24 → 4016.56] us peace that shalom to us that made us whole and complete what was broken in us all of it was on him
[4016.56 → 4029.76] and by his wounds we are healed his broken body enabled us to be made whole his experience of separation
[4029.76 → 4036.00] from god enabled us to be reconciled with god his suffering from violence his death on the cross
[4036.64 → 4044.16] absorbed all the sin and the malice of this world and that is how god made peace with us
[4044.80 → 4050.56] that is how god is reconciling all things to himself so then it shouldn't surprise us when Jesus
[4050.56 → 4056.32] was raised from the dead he meets with his disciples who are afraid they're in that upper room
[4056.32 → 4065.52] and he appears to them and what does he say to them shalom peace be with you in other words may
[4065.52 → 4070.88] all the abundance of god's peace be with you all the goodness that god intended for the world be
[4071.68 → 4080.08] with you because you are standing before the risen lord himself the peacemaker who has conquered death
[4080.08 → 4087.20] who has forgiven sins who have risen to new life and who is making all things new peace be with you
[4088.00 → 4095.76] because you have been made whole and complete in Christ so friends god is the one who makes peace with us
[4096.72 → 4105.28] but then having come down and declared peace into our lives he then sends us out to spread that peace to
[4105.28 → 4112.72] others so now let's consider the second part of this beatitude it just says for then they will be called
[4112.72 → 4118.40] children of god that is the promise they will be called children of god now what does that mean
[4118.40 → 4125.20] children of god I mean kind of we know what it means, but it's its a Hebrew idiom in the Greek it
[4125.20 → 4132.40] literally says sons of god um children is more inclusive and that's fine, but it says sons of god and so the
[4132.40 → 4139.12] idiom is this for example jams and john are called the sons of thunder why are they called why is Jesus
[4139.12 → 4144.64] called jams and john sons of thunder well probably because they were some thunderous dudes right they
[4144.64 → 4154.88] were like so he called sons of god or children of god means to be godly dudes or godly children of god
[4155.44 → 4161.12] right it's like saying you know that phrase a chip off the old block that's all of us we are a chip off
[4161.12 → 4170.64] god's little block or whatever um like father like son like daughter like mother like
[4170.64 → 4176.72] daughter however that goes right, so peacemakers are called children of god because they are reflecting
[4176.72 → 4186.80] the very character of god in the world we're we're we're godly in a sense we are we're like him, we're his
[4186.80 → 4195.68] children we resemble him in peacemaking we inherit the family business what's the family business of god
[4197.84 → 4204.40] shalom restoring shalom that's what god is about and that's what we as his children his sons and
[4204.40 → 4212.08] daughters we take on the family business god and sons and daughters the family business that's what it means
[4212.08 → 4220.48] what does this look like in practice how can every one of us step into this flow of god spreading peace
[4221.28 → 4227.68] just leave us with two thoughts this morning the first thing is you must know the god of peace
[4228.64 → 4236.24] yourself you must know the god of peace yourself Paul says in Colossians 3 15 he says let
[4236.24 → 4248.40] the shalom of Christ the peace of Christ rule in your hearts when Jesus makes us a child of god he demands
[4248.40 → 4259.04] surrender to his peace let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts let the peace of Christ overrule
[4259.04 → 4269.92] your heart so that his peace is ruling and here's where we get the energy to do that just let god love you
[4273.04 → 4282.32] that's what we got to do just let god love you let god speak peace into your troubled hearts let god
[4282.32 → 4288.96] embrace you and comfort you he is the bible says the father of mercies and the god of all
[4288.96 → 4302.48] comfort that is who he is let his peace rule overcome overwhelm take control of your hearts to be peacemakers
[4302.48 → 4309.52] in this world to join god in healing whatever is broken the only way we can do that is as an overflow
[4309.52 → 4316.32] of god's peace and his wholeness in our own lives and then secondly once we are letting the peace
[4316.32 → 4322.24] of Christ rule in our hearts we can start praying this prayer of saint Francis of Assisi that he prayed
[4322.24 → 4335.28] lord make me an instrument of your peace lord make me an instrument of your peace right that is a bold prayer
[4335.28 → 4343.28] whenever you know if we pray that get ready because god's going to answer it if you pray lord make me
[4343.28 → 4349.04] an instrument of your peace god is going to answer that prayer you are going to be put in situations
[4349.04 → 4358.00] where you are called to shalom a relationship or something that is broken in this world because
[4358.00 → 4363.84] that's what god is about that is what god is doing, and it's to say god however you want to use me to bring
[4363.84 → 4371.52] your goodness and shalom into a peace disrupted world I'm open I'm available I've experienced your
[4371.52 → 4377.36] peace your peace is ruling in my heart lord I am a child of the peacemaking god
[4379.92 → 4386.00] use me as an instrument to make peace in this world so true children of god in the world today
[4386.00 → 4390.96] we're sowing seeds of peace and shalom and healing wherever we can in every relationship
[4391.52 → 4397.76] to whatever extent is possible not everyone's receptive of it but as far as it depends on us
[4398.72 → 4403.68] we sow seeds of peace what does this look like practically let's just name some examples
[4404.72 → 4408.00] it's telling others about Jesus so that they can know that god of peace
[4408.88 → 4415.04] how do I mean we all need to make peace we have to be god has to make peace with us so how do we make
[4415.04 → 4420.56] have someone else experience peace well they have to know Jesus don't they so we need to tell them
[4420.56 → 4427.84] about the peacemaker, and they can experience peace shalom comes it's giving a testimony as we've been
[4427.84 → 4434.80] doing in our adult education cross-training class about how god has worked in your life how he has healed
[4434.80 → 4442.88] what is broken how you have experienced the shalom of god that's how we can be peacemakers it's sharing a
[4442.88 → 4452.80] meal with someone inviting someone to your table who to to to heal maybe their loneliness or to
[4452.80 → 4458.80] heal relationship it's being a friend to someone who needs a friend it's forgiving someone who maybe
[4458.80 → 4465.36] has sinned against you, it's caring for creation it's serving god in your work it's speaking truth
[4465.36 → 4474.88] even when it's uncomfortable in all of these things you are giving the world a glimpse of shalom helping
[4474.88 → 4483.84] make the world more like it was originally made to be and what it will one day be so blessed are you
[4483.84 → 4491.36] when you have experienced the peace of the peacemaking god, and you become a peacemaker let's pray
[4491.36 → 4501.92] Jesus we thank you that you were the great peacemaker when we were enemies with god you made a way for us
[4501.92 → 4513.36] to become friends and not simply friends but to become family children of god thank you lord and give us the
[4513.36 → 4520.32] courage to take up the hard work of peacemaking in our own lives to be your children to be peacemakers
[4520.32 → 4527.92] in the name of Jesus we pray amen so let's stand, and we are going to sing as a song of response a song

[4584.78 → 4588.84] Shalom, shalom,
[4590.18 → 4594.86] The peace of God to every race.
[4594.86 → 4599.86] Shalom, shalom,
[4600.50 → 4606.86] The peace of God in every place.
[4615.56 → 4621.72] When walking we are led astray,
[4621.72 → 4627.30] Your Spirit lead us the way,
[4627.72 → 4633.04] To bring us back in colour our days,
[4633.30 → 4637.72] To fill our lives with peace.
[4639.72 → 4642.72] Shalom, shalom,
[4642.72 → 4648.72] The peace of God to every race.
[4648.72 → 4652.72] Shalom, shalom,
[4654.72 → 4660.72] The peace of God in every place.
[4660.72 → 4676.26] God's grace you offer us to live,
[4676.72 → 4681.98] The peace the world can never give,
[4681.98 → 4686.98] And while your Spirit is blessed,
[4686.98 → 4691.98] You fill our lives with peace.
[4692.98 → 4697.98] Shalom, shalom,
[4697.98 → 4702.98] The peace of God to every race.
[4702.98 → 4707.98] So love, so love,
[4707.98 → 4714.98] The peace of God in every place.
[4714.98 → 4737.98] One of the ways that we are privileged to join God in restoring peace and shalom to a broken world,
[4737.98 → 4739.98] Is through the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4739.98 → 4741.98] Is through that,
[4741.98 → 4744.98] Is really one way that we can bring peace to the world.
[4744.98 → 4747.98] And that is what we do next in our worship.
[4747.98 → 4750.98] You can give in person as the deacons pass the offering baskets,
[4750.98 → 4753.98] Or you can give online if you prefer.
[4753.98 → 4756.98] Our designated offering today is M2W2,
[4756.98 → 4762.98] Which is a social justice organization that works in prisons.
[4762.98 → 4767.98] So, may I ask the deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[4792.98 → 4804.98] See this Sunday ?
[4804.98 → 4809.98] Innocent suck forward.
[4809.98 → 4812.98] A galaxy at sporks among Thole,

[4818.98 → 4820.98] Amen.

[4878.98 → 4880.98] Amen.
[4908.98 → 4910.98] Amen.
[4924.98 → 4929.20] So please pray with me as we lift some concerns of our world and our congregation.
[4929.82 → 4937.84] We just, well, one thing we will pray for is we found out this morning that Mary Ann Schema's mom, Mrs. Vander well, passed away last night.
[4937.84 → 4941.90] Peacefully in her sleep at the age of 100 in Elam.
[4942.66 → 4945.06] So we will pray for Henry and Mary Ann today.
[4945.50 → 4946.76] Please join me in prayer.
[4949.74 → 4955.92] God, we do thank you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, that you call us to yourself.
[4956.82 → 4965.38] And you have invited us and commanded us to be peacemakers in this world, to be on mission with you.
[4965.38 → 4973.00] And so we ask, Lord, that you would tune our hearts to know what you are calling us to do.
[4973.90 → 4991.02] And we pray that you would help us to seek your will together in community, to know that how we as a church and us individually, how we can be shalom makers in our city of Delta, where we are, in Richmond, in Swanson, Land, or where we live.
[4991.02 → 4994.66] Lord, we pray for your work around the world.
[4994.76 → 4997.92] We especially pray, Lord, for what's going on in Turkey and Syria.
[4999.34 → 5001.94] Our hearts are just broken over what is happening there.
[5003.00 → 5010.86] We pray that if there are still any survivors who are holding on to hope, that you would help them to be found and to be rescued.
[5010.86 → 5018.46] Father, we pray for the survivors of the earthquake who are also just wracked by grief.
[5019.34 → 5022.38] Lord, meet them in their anguish.
[5023.12 → 5026.24] And we pray that you would minister deeply to their souls.
[5027.36 → 5032.36] We pray, Lord, for the workers who are there, especially those who bear the name of Jesus,
[5032.36 → 5041.16] that you would sustain them, that you would help them to bring your hope even as they struggle in the midst of the devastation all around them.
[5042.06 → 5045.74] Lord, help them to be instruments of your peace in what you have called them to do.
[5047.26 → 5050.68] And God, as millions of people today gather to watch the Super Bowl,
[5051.64 → 5055.44] we pray for two ads that will feature Jesus.
[5056.14 → 5058.56] Lord, we know some people will love them.
[5059.60 → 5061.14] Some people will hate the ads.
[5061.14 → 5065.74] But we pray that they would spark curiosity and conversation,
[5066.16 → 5070.80] that by your spirit would eventually cause people to come to know you.
[5070.90 → 5075.64] Lord, you are able to use anything that bears your name, Lord, to draw people to yourself.
[5077.80 → 5081.94] God, we pray those who are struggling with health in our own congregation,
[5082.14 → 5088.16] whether it be physical, emotional, spiritual, or relational.
[5088.16 → 5102.92] Lord, we pray for Pat and Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Jerry and Anne, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, Henry.
[5102.92 → 5110.44] And Lord, we pray that you would be their refuge and their ever-present help.
[5110.74 → 5113.06] Lord, we pray for Nancy as she continues to recover.
[5113.58 → 5117.72] And for Jordan as he continues to go through chemo.
[5118.20 → 5120.44] We pray for Grace as well.
[5121.30 → 5123.82] Lord, help them, each one of them, to believe in you,
[5124.96 → 5127.46] that you promised to never leave us nor forsake us.
[5127.46 → 5132.76] Father, we lift to you today those who have recently lost loved ones.
[5133.32 → 5139.08] Lord, we pray for Henry and Mary Ann with the death of their mother, of Mary Ann's mom.
[5139.82 → 5144.48] We pray, Lord, also still for Harriet and Al as they mourn the loss of Harriet's mom.
[5144.48 → 5149.56] We pray for comfort for grieving family members.
[5150.56 → 5156.00] And Lord, that they would be intimately and deeply comforted with your love.
[5156.50 → 5162.74] And we pray this all in the mighty name of our Lord and our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[5163.58 → 5163.94] Amen.
[5165.32 → 5171.24] Friends, let's stand, and we go out also with God's final word upon us,
[5171.54 → 5173.26] his blessing, his good word.
[5173.26 → 5176.20] And again, I invite you after the service to join us.
[5176.62 → 5178.16] The coffee will be served in the foyer.
[5178.86 → 5181.88] Soup and buns will be served in the fellowship hall.
[5182.00 → 5184.10] And I do hope many of you will join us for that.
[5184.62 → 5187.58] Now, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5188.22 → 5191.88] Now, may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant,
[5192.42 → 5194.62] brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5195.02 → 5196.62] that great shepherd of the sheep,
[5197.20 → 5199.84] equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[5199.84 → 5205.46] And may he work in us what is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ,
[5206.06 → 5207.80] to whom be glory forever and ever.
[5208.40 → 5208.76] Amen.
[5208.76 → 5215.58] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song of blessing and benediction as we go from here.
[5215.58 → 5222.16] This is a new song to teach to you today.
[5222.32 → 5225.56] It's just simply called a church family prayer song.
[5225.56 → 5228.02] And we'll sing it for you once through.
[5228.76 → 5231.28] And you can listen to that.
[5231.42 → 5233.84] And then we'll sing it through twice together.
[5233.84 → 5235.84] Amen.
[5243.70 → 5244.44] Thank you.
