[755.68 --> 762.62]  And simply distills in the blue and the gray.
[764.06 --> 770.70]  Frail children of cross, and feeble as well,
[770.70 --> 777.58]  In you to retost, nor find you to fail,
[777.58 --> 784.38]  For mercy's now tender, now full to the end,
[784.78 --> 792.30]  Thou maker, defender, redeemer, and kind.
[794.30 --> 794.72]  Amen.

[828.40 --> 833.92]  And glorify your name.
[834.64 --> 840.74]  Your name is a strong and mighty color,
[840.74 --> 847.06]  Your name is a shelter like no other,
[847.06 --> 849.06]  Your name.
[850.42 --> 853.14]  Let the nations sing along,
[853.86 --> 858.28]  There's nothing as an hour to say,
[858.28 --> 861.52]  But your name.
[861.52 --> 863.52]  Amen.
[863.52 --> 865.52]  Amen.
[865.52 --> 867.52]  Amen.
[867.52 --> 868.52]  Amen.
[868.52 --> 869.52]  Amen.
[869.52 --> 870.52]  Amen.
[870.52 --> 871.52]  Amen.
[871.52 --> 873.52]  Amen.
[873.52 --> 878.84]  Jesus, in your name we pray,
[879.64 --> 884.78]  Come and fill our hearts today,
[884.78 --> 891.40]  Lord, give us rain to live for you,
[891.40 --> 896.40]  And glorify your name.
[896.40 --> 904.06]  Your name is a song in the mighty tower
[904.06 --> 910.48]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[910.48 --> 916.66]  Your name, yet the nations still in love
[916.66 --> 921.74]  Cause nothing has the power to sing
[921.74 --> 951.72]  Your name
[951.72 --> 956.48]  Is a song in the mighty tower
[956.48 --> 962.76]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[962.76 --> 965.86]  Your name
[965.86 --> 969.00]  Let the nations sing in love
[969.00 --> 974.08]  Cause nothing has the power to sing
[974.08 --> 978.84]  Your name
[978.84 --> 981.84]  Your name is a song in the mighty tower
[981.84 --> 987.84]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[987.84 --> 996.60]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[996.60 --> 998.88]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[998.88 --> 1006.60]  Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[1006.60 --> 1015.36]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[1015.36 --> 1019.64]  Your name, yet the nations sing in love
[1019.64 --> 1024.40]  Cause nothing has the power to sing
[1024.40 --> 1027.10]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[1027.10 --> 1035.16]  Your name is a shelter like no other
[1035.16 --> 1036.26]  for our next song.
[1043.96 --> 1046.80]  This next song we introduced a couple weeks ago
[1046.80 --> 1050.20]  and we'll be just singing it a few times
[1050.20 --> 1055.18]  over the weeks to become more familiar with it.
[1055.56 --> 1057.96]  A wonderful song about God's goodness
[1057.96 --> 1060.90]  that was there when we woke up this morning.
[1061.02 --> 1062.34]  It was there when we went to sleep.
[1062.34 --> 1064.56]  Last night goes before us
[1064.56 --> 1068.00]  and we can be so encouraged by the goodness of God.
[1085.68 --> 1086.86]  Let's sing together.
[1086.86 --> 1090.92]  I love you, Lord.
[1090.92 --> 1094.36]  I love you, Lord.
[1094.36 --> 1097.80]  I love you, Lord.
[1097.80 --> 1103.24]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1103.24 --> 1108.68]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1108.68 --> 1114.12]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1114.12 --> 1120.62]  Oh, my life you have been so, so good.
[1120.62 --> 1126.06]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1126.06 --> 1134.06]  Oh, my life you have been so, so good.
[1134.06 --> 1139.26]  Oh, my life you have been so good.
[1139.50 --> 1141.50]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1141.50 --> 1142.46]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1142.46 --> 1144.24]  Oh, my life you have было.
[1144.24 --> 1145.46]  Oh, my love you.
[1145.46 --> 1146.48]  Oh, my love you.
[1146.48 --> 1148.48]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1148.48 --> 1149.26]  Oh, my life you have been faithful in life.
[1149.26 --> 1149.96]  Oh, my half you have been faithful.
[1149.96 --> 1151.50]  Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1151.50 --> 1152.10]  Oh, my life you haveamba.
[1152.10 --> 1158.78]  You were led me through the wild, your life is dark as mine.
[1159.40 --> 1162.88]  You were close like no other.
[1164.60 --> 1166.56]  I've known you as a father.
[1167.56 --> 1170.56]  I've known you as a friend.
[1170.56 --> 1177.62]  I have been in the goodness of all.
[1177.62 --> 1184.90]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1187.50 --> 1191.76]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1191.76 --> 1193.76]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1195.58 --> 1206.60]  With any breath that I have made, I will sing under the rest of God.
[1207.62 --> 1212.64]  Your goodness is running out.
[1213.02 --> 1215.82]  It's running out to me.
[1216.90 --> 1219.98]  Your goodness is running out.
[1219.98 --> 1223.36]  It's running out to me.
[1223.44 --> 1227.38]  When my life went down, I surrendered now.
[1227.62 --> 1229.74]  I gave you everything.
[1229.74 --> 1234.56]  Your goodness is running out.
[1234.56 --> 1237.94]  It's running out to me.
[1237.94 --> 1241.82]  Your goodness is running out.
[1241.82 --> 1244.40]  It's running out to me.
[1244.40 --> 1249.22]  Your goodness is running out.
[1249.22 --> 1252.08]  It's running out to me.
[1252.08 --> 1256.16]  When my life went down, I surrendered now.
[1256.40 --> 1258.40]  I gave you everything.
[1258.40 --> 1259.40]  Your goodness is running out.
[1259.40 --> 1263.22]  Your goodness is running out.
[1263.22 --> 1265.40]  It's running out to me.
[1265.40 --> 1275.22]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1275.22 --> 1277.72]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1277.72 --> 1286.50]  All my life you have been so, so good.
[1286.50 --> 1292.50]  With every breath that I am able
[1292.50 --> 1300.50]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[1300.50 --> 1307.50]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[1316.50 --> 1323.50]  I did want to say earlier, thank you for those of you who showed up at 10 o'clock
[1323.50 --> 1324.50]  Well done
[1324.50 --> 1327.50]  Maybe some of you will be coming in 15 minutes
[1327.50 --> 1329.50]  Normally our service is at 1030
[1329.50 --> 1331.50]  And I know this weekend is a long weekend
[1331.50 --> 1333.50]  A lot of people are traveling
[1333.50 --> 1336.50]  And so glad that you're here
[1336.50 --> 1340.50]  So we come now to a time of confession
[1340.50 --> 1343.50]  And before we can appreciate
[1343.50 --> 1350.50]  To bask in the saving power of what Jesus Christ came to do
[1350.50 --> 1354.50]  We need to not only confess but also to lament
[1354.50 --> 1359.50]  The sinfulness, the brokenness that plagues our hearts
[1359.50 --> 1361.50]  And that plagues the world
[1361.50 --> 1365.50]  The very things that occasioned for him to come
[1365.50 --> 1369.50]  And die in our place in order to offer us forgiveness in life
[1369.50 --> 1376.50]  And so this time of confession is an opportunity for us to confess our sin to God
[1376.50 --> 1381.50]  And not from a place of despair and discouragement
[1381.50 --> 1384.50]  But we acknowledge our sin
[1384.50 --> 1388.50]  So that we can experience God's forgiveness
[1388.50 --> 1394.50]  So that we can know the joy and the gladness of being restored and reconciled to God
[1394.50 --> 1397.50]  Through Christ our Lord
[1397.50 --> 1401.50]  So please join me in this prayer of confession from Psalm 139
[1401.50 --> 1405.50]  And then I will give you a time for silent confession
[1405.50 --> 1406.50]  Afterward
[1406.50 --> 1411.50]  So please let's just read these two verses from Psalm 139 together
[1411.50 --> 1413.50]  Search me God
[1413.50 --> 1415.50]  Search me God and know my heart
[1415.50 --> 1419.50]  Test me and know my anxious thoughts
[1419.50 --> 1423.50]  See if there is any offensive way in me
[1423.50 --> 1426.50]  And lead me in the way everlasting
[1426.50 --> 1429.50]  And so let's take a moment of silence
[1429.50 --> 1433.50]  And allow God who is the searcher of our hearts
[1433.50 --> 1435.50]  To search our hearts now
[1435.50 --> 1454.10]  the meaning ofvision
[1460.50 --> 1461.50]  Hos mod
[1461.50 --> 1470.02]  O Lord, we acknowledge that our hearts, our entire lives are laid bare before you.
[1471.64 --> 1478.10]  And Lord, we thank you and we praise you for the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1478.22 --> 1483.48]  through whom we can approach the throne of grace to seek forgiveness and healing.
[1484.24 --> 1489.06]  And Lord, we honestly, therefore, admit our sin before you.
[1489.06 --> 1495.08]  We lament it and we thank you that you then say to us, I will heal you.
[1495.58 --> 1496.68]  I will come to you.
[1498.00 --> 1500.22]  And so, Lord, we thank you for your grace to us this morning.
[1500.34 --> 1506.04]  Help us to be renewed by the grace and power of your Holy Spirit at work in our lives
[1506.04 --> 1510.92]  to follow you more faithfully as your followers,
[1511.90 --> 1516.70]  those who are loved by our Lord Jesus Christ, children of God.
[1516.70 --> 1519.84]  We thank you and praise you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1522.32 --> 1527.44]  Our assurance of pardon comes to us from Romans 8.
[1527.98 --> 1531.70]  So hear the words of grace, hear the good news of the gospel.
[1532.72 --> 1535.78]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[1536.68 --> 1543.48]  Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[1543.48 --> 1547.64]  As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.
[1547.98 --> 1550.48]  We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[1551.42 --> 1555.98]  No, in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[1556.44 --> 1558.90]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[1559.74 --> 1561.62]  neither angels nor demons,
[1562.58 --> 1565.26]  neither the present nor the future nor any powers,
[1565.44 --> 1567.28]  neither height nor depth,
[1567.28 --> 1569.36]  nor anything else in all creation,
[1569.36 --> 1569.38]  nor anything else in all creation,
[1569.80 --> 1573.10]  will be able to separate us from the love of God
[1573.10 --> 1576.36]  that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1576.82 --> 1577.82]  Thanks be to God.
[1578.38 --> 1583.18]  Let's stand together again and let's sing our song of response.
[1583.18 --> 1601.56]  What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[1601.56 --> 1608.34]  There is the Lord for heaven now to be.
[1608.34 --> 1615.16]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom,
[1615.16 --> 1622.90]  my steadfast love, my deep and loudest peace.
[1622.90 --> 1629.16]  To His I hold, my hope is only Jesus,
[1630.58 --> 1636.48]  for my life is only bound to Him.
[1636.48 --> 1640.80]  All I've changed and divine,
[1641.12 --> 1642.70]  I can sing,
[1642.80 --> 1644.42]  All is mine,
[1644.60 --> 1645.96]  Yet not I,
[1646.30 --> 1649.76]  But through Christ in me.
[1649.76 --> 1663.76]  The night is dark,
[1663.76 --> 1667.36]  But I am not forsaken,
[1667.36 --> 1670.74]  For by my side,
[1671.18 --> 1673.76]  The Savior He will stay,
[1673.76 --> 1676.44]  My neighbor,
[1676.44 --> 1676.54]  My neighbor,
[1676.54 --> 1678.28]  I am not forsaken,
[1678.28 --> 1678.88]  My neighbor,
[1678.88 --> 1679.72]  I am not forsaken,
[1679.72 --> 1680.88]  I am not forsaken,
[1680.88 --> 1684.60]  For in my name,
[1684.60 --> 1688.06]  His power is displayed.
[1688.06 --> 1691.88]  To this I hold,
[1692.26 --> 1696.52]  My shepherd will deliver me,
[1696.78 --> 1702.06]  Through the deepest valley He will be.
[1702.06 --> 1710.06]  All the night has been one, and I shall overcome
[1710.06 --> 1716.06]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1716.06 --> 1733.56]  No fate I dare, I know I am forgiven
[1733.56 --> 1740.40]  The future's short, the price it has been paid
[1740.40 --> 1747.62]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[1747.62 --> 1754.40]  And he was raised to overthrow the grave
[1755.00 --> 1761.14]  To this I hold my sin and been defeated
[1761.14 --> 1768.40]  Jesus now and ever is my plea
[1768.40 --> 1774.16]  All the days are released, I can see
[1774.16 --> 1781.40]  I am free, yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1781.40 --> 1798.88]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[1798.88 --> 1805.40]  For he has said that he will bring me home
[1805.40 --> 1813.40]  And day by day I know he will renew me
[1813.40 --> 1819.40]  Until I stand with joy before the throne
[1819.40 --> 1826.40]  To this I hold, my hope is our Lord Jesus
[1826.40 --> 1832.40]  All the glory evermore to me
[1832.40 --> 1837.40]  When the race is complete
[1837.40 --> 1840.40]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1840.40 --> 1846.40]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1846.40 --> 1860.40]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1860.40 --> 1864.40]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1864.40 --> 1872.40]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1872.40 --> 1886.40]  Yet not I, but with Christ in me
[1886.40 --> 1890.40]  So, starting this Sunday
[1890.40 --> 1893.40]  We have one combined Sunday school class
[1893.40 --> 1895.40]  So instead of our three classes
[1895.40 --> 1898.40]  We have one class for the younger set age
[1898.40 --> 1899.40]  Can't read it
[1899.40 --> 1901.40]  Three through grade one
[1901.40 --> 1904.40]  So, any kids who are in that age
[1904.40 --> 1905.40]  Can now go to their class
[1905.40 --> 1907.40]  And for you other kids who are older
[1907.40 --> 1911.40]  You can stay here and continue to worship with us
[1911.40 --> 1916.40]  And so, we have been in a sermon series
[1916.40 --> 1918.40]  Just started over the last couple weeks
[1918.40 --> 1920.40]  In the book of Acts
[1920.40 --> 1922.40]  Today we will be in Acts chapter 12
[1922.40 --> 1926.40]  So, let's prepare our hearts to hear God's word
[1941.40 --> 1951.40]  Today's reading is from Acts chapter 12
[1951.40 --> 1957.40]  It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church
[1957.40 --> 1960.40]  Intending to persecute them
[1960.40 --> 1966.40]  He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword
[1966.40 --> 1970.40]  When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews
[1970.40 --> 1973.40]  He proceeded to seize Peter also
[1973.40 --> 1977.40]  This happened during the festival of unleavened bread
[1977.40 --> 1981.40]  After arresting him, he put him in prison
[1981.40 --> 1987.40]  Handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each
[1987.40 --> 1995.40]  Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover
[1995.40 --> 1997.40]  So, Peter was kept in prison
[1997.40 --> 2003.40]  But the church was earnestly praying to God for him
[2003.40 --> 2007.40]  The night before Herod was to bring him to trial
[2007.40 --> 2012.40]  Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains
[2012.40 --> 2016.40]  And sentries stood guard at the entrance
[2016.40 --> 2019.40]  Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared
[2019.40 --> 2022.40]  And a light shone in the cell
[2022.40 --> 2025.40]  He struck Peter on the side and woke him up
[2025.40 --> 2028.40]  Quick, get up, he said
[2028.40 --> 2031.40]  And the chains fell off Peter's wrists
[2031.40 --> 2035.40]  Then the angel said to him
[2035.40 --> 2037.40]  Put on your clothes and sandals
[2037.40 --> 2039.40]  And Peter did so
[2039.40 --> 2044.40]  Wrap your cloak around you and follow me, the angel told him
[2044.40 --> 2045.40]  Peter followed him
[2045.40 --> 2047.40]  Peter followed him out of the prison
[2047.40 --> 2054.40]  But he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening
[2054.40 --> 2056.40]  He thought he was seeing a vision
[2056.40 --> 2060.40]  They passed the first and second guards
[2060.40 --> 2063.40]  And came to the iron gate leading to the city
[2063.40 --> 2067.40]  It opened for them by itself and they went through it
[2067.40 --> 2071.40]  When they had walked the length of one street
[2071.40 --> 2074.40]  Suddenly the angel left him
[2074.40 --> 2078.40]  Then Peter came to himself and said
[2078.40 --> 2082.40]  Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel
[2082.40 --> 2084.40]  And rescued me from Herod's clutches
[2084.40 --> 2088.40]  And from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen
[2088.40 --> 2093.40]  When this had dawned on him
[2093.40 --> 2097.40]  He went to the house of Mary, the mother of John
[2097.40 --> 2099.40]  Also called Mark
[2099.40 --> 2103.40]  Where many people had gathered and were praying
[2103.40 --> 2106.40]  Peter knocked at the outer entrance
[2106.40 --> 2111.40]  And a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door
[2111.40 --> 2113.40]  When she recognized Peter's voice
[2113.40 --> 2115.40]  She was so overjoyed
[2115.40 --> 2117.40]  She ran back without opening it
[2117.40 --> 2118.40]  And exclaimed
[2118.40 --> 2120.40]  Peter is at the door
[2120.40 --> 2123.40]  You're out of your mind
[2123.40 --> 2124.40]  They told her
[2124.40 --> 2126.40]  When she kept insisting that it was so
[2126.40 --> 2129.40]  They said it must be his angel
[2129.40 --> 2133.40]  But Peter kept on knocking
[2133.40 --> 2136.40]  And when they opened the door and saw him
[2136.40 --> 2138.40]  They were astonished
[2138.40 --> 2141.40]  Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet
[2141.40 --> 2145.40]  And described how the Lord had brought him out of prison
[2145.40 --> 2149.40]  Tell James and the other brothers and the sisters about this
[2149.40 --> 2150.40]  He said
[2150.40 --> 2153.40]  And then he left for another place
[2155.40 --> 2159.40]  In the morning there was no small commotion among the soldiers
[2159.40 --> 2161.40]  As to what had become of Peter
[2161.40 --> 2165.40]  After Herod had thorough search made for him
[2165.40 --> 2167.40]  And did not find him
[2167.40 --> 2172.40]  He cross examined the guards and ordered that they be executed
[2172.40 --> 2178.40]  Then Herod went to Judea and Caesarea and stayed there
[2178.40 --> 2182.40]  He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon
[2182.40 --> 2186.40]  They now joined together and sought an audience with him
[2186.40 --> 2190.40]  After securing the support of Blastus
[2190.40 --> 2193.40]  A trusted personal servant of the king
[2193.40 --> 2195.40]  They asked for peace
[2195.40 --> 2200.40]  Because they depended on the king's country for their food supply
[2200.40 --> 2204.40]  On the appointed day
[2204.40 --> 2206.40]  Herod wearing his royal robes
[2206.40 --> 2208.40]  Sat on his throne
[2208.40 --> 2211.40]  And delivered a public address to the people
[2211.40 --> 2213.40]  They shouted
[2213.40 --> 2215.40]  This is the voice of God
[2215.40 --> 2216.40]  Not a man
[2216.40 --> 2217.40]  Immediately
[2217.40 --> 2222.40]  Because Herod did not give praise to God
[2222.40 --> 2225.40]  An angel of the Lord struck him down
[2225.40 --> 2228.40]  And he was eaten by worms and died
[2228.40 --> 2234.40]  But the word of God continued to spread and flourish
[2234.40 --> 2239.40]  When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission
[2239.40 --> 2244.40]  They returned from Jerusalem taking with them
[2244.40 --> 2247.40]  John also called Mark
[2247.40 --> 2250.40]  This is the word of the Lord
[2250.40 --> 2263.40]  Thank you, Rita. Well done. That was a very long passage
[2263.40 --> 2266.40]  All of Acts chapter 12
[2269.40 --> 2271.40]  So let's come before the Lord in prayer
[2271.40 --> 2273.40]  As we open up his word together
[2273.40 --> 2276.40]  Our gracious God, we thank you for your word
[2276.40 --> 2279.40]  Which you have given to feed us spiritually
[2279.40 --> 2283.40]  Lord, we ask that you would give us grace this morning
[2283.40 --> 2285.40]  To feed upon your word
[2285.40 --> 2288.40]  So that we might be nourished by your truth
[2288.40 --> 2290.40]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord
[2290.40 --> 2293.40]  In whose name we pray
[2293.40 --> 2294.40]  Amen
[2296.40 --> 2298.40]  Now there is a book on prayer
[2298.40 --> 2300.40]  By David Crump
[2300.40 --> 2303.40]  Who used to teach at Calvin University
[2303.40 --> 2304.40]  He's now retired
[2304.40 --> 2306.40]  And in his book
[2306.40 --> 2308.40]  He tells this story
[2309.40 --> 2310.40]  He says this
[2310.40 --> 2313.40]  I once had a good friend
[2313.40 --> 2316.40]  Who had grown up in Central Africa
[2316.40 --> 2320.40]  Her parents were missionaries in the bush
[2320.40 --> 2324.40]  And she was well acquainted with primitive living conditions
[2324.40 --> 2329.40]  I knew her as a sane, well-adjusted woman
[2329.40 --> 2333.40]  Not prone to fantasy or exaggeration
[2333.40 --> 2336.40]  Yet on more than one occasion
[2336.40 --> 2338.40]  I heard her tell the story
[2338.40 --> 2340.40]  Of how her family's vehicle
[2340.40 --> 2344.40]  Had once run out of gas
[2344.40 --> 2347.40]  On a long cross-country trip
[2347.40 --> 2351.40]  Her father had underestimated the length of the journey
[2351.40 --> 2355.40]  Leaving them stranded in the blistering African sun
[2355.40 --> 2357.40]  Miles away from anywhere
[2357.40 --> 2360.40]  While his wife and three children
[2360.40 --> 2362.40]  Tried to find some refuge
[2362.40 --> 2363.40]  In the vehicle
[2363.40 --> 2364.40]  The shade of the vehicle
[2364.40 --> 2367.40]  The young father prayed
[2367.40 --> 2369.40]  Knowing that his miscalculation
[2369.40 --> 2371.40]  Had placed his family
[2371.40 --> 2373.40]  In a life or death situation
[2374.40 --> 2376.40]  The spare gas canisters
[2376.40 --> 2378.40]  Were empty
[2378.40 --> 2381.40]  But they did have a large canister
[2381.40 --> 2382.40]  Of water
[2382.40 --> 2386.40]  Raising the water to heaven
[2386.40 --> 2389.40]  He confessed his foolishness
[2389.40 --> 2391.40]  And asked the Lord to perform a miracle
[2391.40 --> 2393.40]  In order to save his family
[2393.40 --> 2396.40]  He then poured it all into the gas tank
[2396.40 --> 2398.40]  I can't believe that
[2399.40 --> 2402.40]  After loading up the family in the car
[2402.40 --> 2404.40]  Climbing into the driver's seat
[2404.40 --> 2406.40]  He turned the ignition
[2406.40 --> 2409.40]  The newly baptized engine roared to life
[2409.40 --> 2411.40]  Enabling them to drive nonstop
[2411.40 --> 2413.40]  To the next village
[2413.40 --> 2414.40]  Where they promptly told anyone
[2414.40 --> 2415.40]  Who would listen
[2415.40 --> 2418.40]  About their Lord's miraculous answer
[2418.40 --> 2420.40]  To their desperate prayer
[2420.40 --> 2424.40]  Now I love reading stories like this
[2424.40 --> 2426.40]  Because they remind me
[2426.40 --> 2429.40]  That God still works miracles today
[2429.40 --> 2430.40]  Doesn't he?
[2430.40 --> 2431.40]  Right?
[2431.40 --> 2433.40]  And he is willing to answer our prayers
[2433.40 --> 2436.40]  In ways that we could never have imagined
[2436.40 --> 2439.40]  Now we can't know in advance
[2439.40 --> 2442.40]  When God will intervene in miraculous ways
[2442.40 --> 2444.40]  Through our prayers
[2444.40 --> 2446.40]  But he can
[2446.40 --> 2448.40]  Sometimes
[2448.40 --> 2449.40]  He does
[2449.40 --> 2451.40]  But
[2451.40 --> 2453.40]  As we all know
[2453.40 --> 2454.40]  There are other times
[2454.40 --> 2455.40]  In the Christian life
[2455.40 --> 2456.40]  When we pray for God
[2456.40 --> 2459.40]  To intervene in a miraculous way
[2459.40 --> 2464.40]  And yet God doesn't seem to answer that prayer
[2464.40 --> 2465.40]  Right?
[2465.40 --> 2468.40]  The miracle we pray would happen
[2468.40 --> 2470.40]  Doesn't show up
[2470.40 --> 2471.40]  It doesn't happen
[2471.40 --> 2474.40]  And when God doesn't answer our prayers
[2474.40 --> 2476.40]  In the way that we hope he will
[2476.40 --> 2480.40]  That can begin to create disbelief in our hearts
[2480.40 --> 2481.40]  Right?
[2481.40 --> 2482.40]  And at the very least
[2482.40 --> 2484.40]  It raises all kinds of questions for us
[2484.40 --> 2485.40]  Doesn't it?
[2485.40 --> 2489.40]  Like does God actually love and care about me?
[2489.40 --> 2492.40]  Has he lost his power?
[2492.40 --> 2494.40]  You know
[2494.40 --> 2496.40]  Or is he truly sovereign?
[2496.40 --> 2499.40]  And in our passage today
[2499.40 --> 2500.40]  In the book of Acts
[2500.40 --> 2503.40]  It shows us that these are the same kind of questions
[2503.40 --> 2506.40]  That the early church was wrestling with as well
[2506.40 --> 2509.40]  In Acts chapter 12
[2509.40 --> 2511.40]  We see this group of Christians
[2511.40 --> 2513.40]  Who believed in Jesus
[2513.40 --> 2515.40]  And were earnestly praying
[2515.40 --> 2516.40]  That somehow
[2516.40 --> 2517.40]  Some way
[2517.40 --> 2518.40]  God would intervene
[2518.40 --> 2520.40]  And miraculously save
[2520.40 --> 2522.40]  James and Peter
[2522.40 --> 2525.40]  From death at the hands of Herod
[2525.40 --> 2527.40]  And then we see
[2527.40 --> 2528.40]  Herod on the other hand
[2528.40 --> 2530.40]  On the other side of things
[2530.40 --> 2531.40]  Who didn't believe
[2531.40 --> 2534.40]  That God could do anything to stop him
[2534.40 --> 2538.40]  From killing James and Peter
[2538.40 --> 2540.40]  Or from stopping the spread of the gospel
[2541.40 --> 2543.40]  So as we look at this passage this morning
[2543.40 --> 2545.40]  And what we do is
[2545.40 --> 2547.40]  We read about these three characters
[2547.40 --> 2549.40]  James, Peter, and Herod
[2550.40 --> 2551.40]  And as we look at this
[2551.40 --> 2552.40]  You know
[2552.40 --> 2553.40]  There are different ways
[2553.40 --> 2554.40]  We could approach this passage
[2554.40 --> 2556.40]  But I want us to look at it
[2556.40 --> 2557.40]  Through this lens of prayer
[2557.40 --> 2559.40]  What can we learn about prayer
[2559.40 --> 2562.40]  From each of these three stories?
[2562.40 --> 2565.40]  So the story begins with James
[2565.40 --> 2567.40]  And from James we learn
[2567.40 --> 2570.40]  That God calls upon us to trust in him
[2571.40 --> 2573.40]  Even when the answer is no
[2573.40 --> 2575.40]  So Luke begins this narrative
[2575.40 --> 2578.40]  By telling us that King Herod
[2578.40 --> 2579.40]  Began at that time
[2579.40 --> 2581.40]  In the area around Jerusalem
[2581.40 --> 2583.40]  So in Acts chapter 11
[2583.40 --> 2585.40]  We were up in Antioch
[2585.40 --> 2587.40]  Now there's kind of a break in the story
[2587.40 --> 2589.40]  And we're back in Jerusalem
[2589.40 --> 2592.40]  And Herod at that time
[2592.40 --> 2595.40]  Really begins to persecute the church
[2596.40 --> 2597.40]  And this Herod
[2597.40 --> 2600.40]  Is Herod Agrippa the first
[2601.40 --> 2604.40]  Now there are lots of Herods
[2604.40 --> 2606.40]  In that appear in the New Testament
[2606.40 --> 2608.40]  So as you're reading the New Testament
[2608.40 --> 2609.40]  You know you might be reading
[2609.40 --> 2610.40]  And it Herod this Herod that
[2610.40 --> 2612.40]  And it can be a challenge
[2612.40 --> 2613.40]  To keep them all straight
[2613.40 --> 2615.40]  But the Herod in our text
[2615.40 --> 2616.40]  In our text
[2616.40 --> 2618.40]  Is the son of Herod Antipas
[2618.40 --> 2620.40]  Who beheaded John the Baptist
[2620.40 --> 2622.40]  And he's the grandson
[2622.40 --> 2624.40]  Of Herod the Great
[2624.40 --> 2626.40]  Who we find at the birth of Christ
[2626.40 --> 2627.40]  Who put all the children
[2627.40 --> 2630.40]  To death who were in Bethlehem
[2630.40 --> 2632.40]  So just know that the Herods
[2632.40 --> 2634.40]  That we find in the New Testament
[2634.40 --> 2635.40]  Are generally bad guys
[2635.40 --> 2638.40]  And here we see Herod Agrippa the first
[2638.40 --> 2641.40]  He begins to persecute the church
[2641.40 --> 2643.40]  So in verse 2
[2643.40 --> 2644.40]  Let's put verse 2 up here
[2644.40 --> 2645.40]  It says this
[2645.40 --> 2648.40]  He had James the brother of John
[2648.40 --> 2650.40]  Put to death with the sword
[2650.40 --> 2652.40]  Right?
[2652.40 --> 2654.40]  Remember James and John?
[2654.40 --> 2656.40]  James and John
[2656.40 --> 2658.40]  They were the sons of thunder
[2658.40 --> 2659.40]  Right?
[2659.40 --> 2661.40]  That's the name that Jesus gave them
[2661.40 --> 2664.40]  And they were part of Jesus' inner circle
[2664.40 --> 2667.40]  It was James and John and Peter
[2667.40 --> 2672.40]  And Herod had James put to death
[2672.40 --> 2677.40]  I mean, yeah, Jesus had told his disciples
[2677.40 --> 2679.40]  That they would suffer for his name
[2679.40 --> 2683.40]  But still it must have been a shock
[2683.40 --> 2686.40]  For the church to see the first one
[2686.40 --> 2689.40]  Of the twelve apostles put to death
[2689.40 --> 2691.40]  And executed
[2691.40 --> 2694.40]  That would have been a shock
[2695.40 --> 2698.40]  You know, and an angel had already rescued James
[2698.40 --> 2701.40]  From prison once before in chapter 5
[2701.40 --> 2705.40]  So James knew that God could rescue him
[2705.40 --> 2706.40]  If he wanted to
[2706.40 --> 2708.40]  He must have prayed
[2708.40 --> 2709.40]  It doesn't say in the text
[2709.40 --> 2711.40]  But he must have prayed
[2711.40 --> 2712.40]  He must have prayed for an angel to come
[2712.40 --> 2714.40]  Like he did last time
[2714.40 --> 2716.40]  But this night
[2716.40 --> 2720.40]  No angel came to deliver James
[2720.40 --> 2721.40]  Right?
[2721.40 --> 2722.40]  In the morning
[2722.40 --> 2724.40]  James was still in jail
[2724.40 --> 2726.40]  When he heard that dreaded voice
[2726.40 --> 2728.40]  Of the captain of the guard shouting
[2728.40 --> 2730.40]  Bring out the prisoner
[2730.40 --> 2732.40]  Then
[2732.40 --> 2734.40]  There was that walk
[2734.40 --> 2737.40]  To appear before Herod
[2737.40 --> 2740.40]  There was the pronouncement of guilt
[2740.40 --> 2742.40]  Maybe there was an offer of pardon
[2742.40 --> 2744.40]  In exchange for recanting
[2744.40 --> 2745.40]  Right?
[2745.40 --> 2747.40]  Followed by Jesus refusing
[2747.40 --> 2748.40]  Sorry, James
[2748.40 --> 2749.40]  Refusing
[2749.40 --> 2750.40]  To deny Jesus
[2750.40 --> 2753.40]  And then James was executed
[2753.40 --> 2754.40]  Right?
[2754.40 --> 2755.40]  The executioner's sword fell
[2755.40 --> 2758.40]  And no deliverance came
[2760.40 --> 2762.40]  So what are we to make of that?
[2763.40 --> 2765.40]  Well, what we can learn about prayer
[2765.40 --> 2767.40]  From James' experience here
[2767.40 --> 2768.40]  I think
[2768.40 --> 2770.40]  Two things come to mind for me
[2770.40 --> 2773.40]  First, we learn that we can't always know
[2773.40 --> 2775.40]  The ways of God, can we?
[2775.40 --> 2776.40]  Right?
[2776.40 --> 2777.40]  We can't say
[2777.40 --> 2778.40]  Well, if I just pray enough
[2778.40 --> 2780.40]  Then there will be healing
[2780.40 --> 2781.40]  Or if I just pray enough
[2781.40 --> 2782.40]  God will deliver
[2782.40 --> 2783.40]  Right?
[2783.40 --> 2787.40]  And surely the church was praying for James
[2787.40 --> 2788.40]  Right?
[2788.40 --> 2789.40]  Lifting him up in prayer
[2789.40 --> 2790.40]  Asking God to deliver
[2790.40 --> 2791.40]  Right?
[2791.40 --> 2792.40]  The church
[2792.40 --> 2793.40]  They needed James
[2793.40 --> 2794.40]  He was one of the apostles
[2794.40 --> 2796.40]  Lord, save James
[2796.40 --> 2798.40]  Surely they prayed that
[2798.40 --> 2801.40]  So why didn't God deliver James?
[2801.40 --> 2806.40]  You know, in one sense
[2806.40 --> 2807.40]  How do we answer this?
[2807.40 --> 2808.40]  Well, in one sense
[2808.40 --> 2810.40]  We could say it's not a surprise
[2810.40 --> 2812.40]  Because in Matthew chapter 20
[2813.40 --> 2815.40]  Remember, one day James
[2815.40 --> 2817.40]  And John's mom
[2817.40 --> 2818.40]  Comes to Jesus
[2818.40 --> 2821.40]  And asks Jesus to allow her two sons
[2821.40 --> 2824.40]  To sit at Jesus' right and left hand
[2824.40 --> 2826.40]  And left hand in his kingdom
[2827.40 --> 2828.40]  And what does Jesus say to them?
[2829.40 --> 2830.40]  You know, he says
[2830.40 --> 2831.40]  Well, it's not for me to give
[2831.40 --> 2832.40]  Will you
[2832.40 --> 2835.40]  Are you able to drink the cup from which I will drink?
[2835.40 --> 2836.40]  And they say, yes
[2837.40 --> 2839.40]  And Jesus says, indeed
[2839.40 --> 2841.40]  One day you will drink the cup that I will drink
[2841.40 --> 2843.40]  Referring to his death and suffering
[2844.40 --> 2846.40]  So here, James, okay
[2846.40 --> 2847.40]  Well, here he is
[2847.40 --> 2848.40]  He's martyred
[2848.40 --> 2849.40]  But
[2849.40 --> 2851.40]  But then look at James' brother John
[2851.40 --> 2852.40]  John
[2852.40 --> 2854.40]  John lived to be an old man
[2854.40 --> 2856.40]  At least 50 more years probably
[2857.40 --> 2860.40]  But James was struck down as a young man
[2860.40 --> 2863.40]  So why did God let James die young
[2863.40 --> 2865.40]  And let John live to an old age?
[2865.40 --> 2867.40]  Even though he too is martyred
[2867.40 --> 2868.40]  As Jesus had first said
[2869.40 --> 2870.40]  Well, ultimately we don't know
[2871.40 --> 2872.40]  Right?
[2872.40 --> 2873.40]  The reality is
[2873.40 --> 2875.40]  There are many things that are hidden from us
[2875.40 --> 2877.40]  That we don't fully see
[2878.40 --> 2880.40]  We can't always know the ways of God
[2880.40 --> 2883.40]  We don't know the end from the beginning
[2884.40 --> 2887.40]  And so as limited, earthly creatures
[2890.40 --> 2892.40]  We must bow before God's sovereignty
[2893.40 --> 2894.40]  And learn to trust him
[2895.40 --> 2896.40]  Right? And that's the second lesson
[2897.40 --> 2898.40]  I think we learn here
[2899.40 --> 2901.40]  We often don't know what God is doing in our lives
[2901.40 --> 2902.40]  Or in the world
[2902.40 --> 2904.40]  And so he asks us to trust him
[2905.40 --> 2907.40]  Right? To say to him, Lord, you are wise
[2907.40 --> 2909.40]  Lord, you are good
[2910.40 --> 2912.40]  And you know what you are doing
[2913.40 --> 2918.40]  Right? Do you remember how Jesus slept in the boat during the storm?
[2919.40 --> 2920.40]  They're on the Sea of Galilee
[2920.40 --> 2921.40]  There's a huge storm
[2921.40 --> 2922.40]  Jesus is sleeping
[2923.40 --> 2924.40]  The disciples, they panic
[2924.40 --> 2927.40]  They fear that they're going to drown
[2927.40 --> 2928.40]  They cry out
[2929.40 --> 2931.40]  Teacher, don't you care if we drown?
[2931.40 --> 2933.40]  Jesus got up
[2934.40 --> 2935.40]  He calmed the storm
[2935.40 --> 2936.40]  Then he said to them
[2936.40 --> 2937.40]  Why are you so afraid?
[2938.40 --> 2941.40]  Do you still have no faith?
[2942.40 --> 2944.40]  And what's Jesus saying here?
[2945.40 --> 2948.40]  He's saying, you're afraid of the wrong thing
[2949.40 --> 2951.40]  Don't fear what or who can kill the body
[2951.40 --> 2952.40]  Fear and trust me
[2952.40 --> 2956.40]  Because I rule over the storms
[2957.40 --> 2959.40]  I reign over death itself
[2960.40 --> 2961.40]  Trust in me
[2962.40 --> 2963.40]  And I think for James
[2964.40 --> 2965.40]  I don't think he was afraid
[2968.40 --> 2971.40]  I think he knew and he trusted that God loved him
[2972.40 --> 2976.40]  Even up till the moment that the sword came down on his head
[2976.40 --> 2981.40]  James trusted that neither life nor death nor anything else in all creation
[2982.40 --> 2986.40]  Will be able to separate him and us from the love of God
[2987.40 --> 2989.40]  That is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[2990.40 --> 2993.40]  So sometimes God calls us to trust him
[2993.40 --> 2995.40]  Even when we don't understand his ways
[2996.40 --> 2997.40]  That's the first point
[2997.40 --> 3000.40]  But then sometimes God delivers miraculously
[3001.40 --> 3002.40]  And that's the second thing we see here
[3002.40 --> 3005.40]  Sometimes God intervenes and God delivers
[3006.40 --> 3012.40]  And that is the longer story about Peter that we see here in verses 3 through 19 in our passage
[3013.40 --> 3015.40]  So again, here's the story
[3016.40 --> 3023.40]  Herod saw that when he had killed James that he got a thumbs up and a 5 star Google rating from the Jews
[3024.40 --> 3028.40]  Who he was attempting to win the favor of
[3028.40 --> 3031.40]  So he said well, okay, let's take this another step
[3032.40 --> 3033.40]  He sees Peter
[3033.40 --> 3034.40]  He throws him in prison
[3035.40 --> 3037.40]  And things are looking pretty bleak right now for Peter
[3038.40 --> 3040.40]  Right? He's locked up in prison
[3041.40 --> 3042.40]  James has just been killed
[3043.40 --> 3044.40]  He's under heavy guard
[3045.40 --> 3046.40]  There are 16 soldiers
[3047.40 --> 3048.40]  Tasked with guarding him
[3049.40 --> 3050.40]  Right? They're not going to make the same mistake back in Acts 5
[3051.40 --> 3052.40]  16 soldiers
[3052.40 --> 3056.40]  And the intention is to bring him out before the people
[3057.40 --> 3058.40]  Before the people after Passover
[3059.40 --> 3060.40]  To put him on trial
[3060.40 --> 3061.40]  Probably to execute him as they did James
[3062.40 --> 3066.40]  And Luke mentions in verse 3 that this was during the festival of unleavened bread
[3067.40 --> 3069.40]  He just throws that detail in there
[3070.40 --> 3075.40]  But what that was that was the celebration of God's rescue of his people from slavery in Egypt
[3076.40 --> 3080.40]  And the fact that they were commanded to eat their dinners that night in haste
[3081.40 --> 3084.40]  Without leavening their bread because they were leaving
[3085.40 --> 3086.40]  They were being delivered
[3087.40 --> 3088.40]  And so maybe, I don't know, maybe
[3089.40 --> 3090.40]  This is a subtle hint from Luke
[3091.40 --> 3095.40]  Reminding us of God's ability to protect and save his people
[3096.40 --> 3099.40]  And maybe this is a hint that God is going to do something
[3099.40 --> 3105.40]  Now I want us to notice this contrast that Luke sets up in verse 5
[3106.40 --> 3107.40]  He says in verse 5
[3108.40 --> 3109.40]  So Peter was kept in prison
[3110.40 --> 3114.40]  But the church was earnestly praying to God for him
[3115.40 --> 3117.40]  And so Luke is giving us this contrast
[3118.40 --> 3122.40]  This picture where on the one hand, Peter is in prison
[3123.40 --> 3125.40]  Right? Herod has Peter in his grasp
[3126.40 --> 3128.40]  And it is not looking good for Peter at all
[3129.40 --> 3133.40]  But the church is earnestly praying for Peter
[3134.40 --> 3137.40]  And perhaps God is going to do something through these prayers
[3138.40 --> 3141.40]  So this is the suspense that Luke is setting up
[3142.40 --> 3143.40]  Will God do this?
[3144.40 --> 3146.40]  Right? Will he answer the prayers of his people?
[3147.40 --> 3152.40]  Well, the suspense, you know, he doesn't hold us in suspense very long
[3152.40 --> 3155.40]  Because on the very night before Herod is about to put Peter on trial
[3156.40 --> 3161.40]  Suddenly, an angel appears in the prison to rescue Peter
[3162.40 --> 3163.40]  And what is Peter doing?
[3163.40 --> 3164.40]  I just find this so funny
[3165.40 --> 3166.40]  He's sleeping
[3167.40 --> 3168.40]  Fast asleep
[3169.40 --> 3170.40]  I don't, I mean, imagine, if you were in prison
[3171.40 --> 3173.40]  About to face your execution, would you be sleeping?
[3174.40 --> 3177.40]  I don't know, I think I would be pretty awake
[3177.40 --> 3178.40]  But for Peter
[3178.40 --> 3182.40]  You know, I think this is a reflection of his Lord
[3183.40 --> 3186.40]  Right? When there was that massive storm on the Sea of Galilee
[3186.40 --> 3188.40]  Jesus was sleeping in the front of the boat
[3189.40 --> 3192.40]  And I think Peter here, as a man who has learned the ways of Jesus
[3193.40 --> 3196.40]  A man who has the Holy Spirit living in him
[3196.40 --> 3201.40]  He is able to entrust his life to Christ fully
[3202.40 --> 3206.40]  Right? He knows whose hands he truly rests in
[3207.40 --> 3210.40]  Right? He knows that Herod ultimately has no power over him
[3211.40 --> 3212.40]  He's not worried about tomorrow
[3213.40 --> 3215.40]  Because he knows that his eternity rests in the hands of Christ
[3216.40 --> 3219.40]  He is under God's care, no matter what happens to him
[3220.40 --> 3223.40]  So he's chained to two guards, he's facing execution
[3223.40 --> 3226.40]  He's going to rest
[3227.40 --> 3228.40]  So he's chained to these two guards
[3229.40 --> 3230.40]  He's asleep and the angel comes in
[3231.40 --> 3234.40]  And the angel shines his angelic light
[3235.40 --> 3236.40]  Into the cell
[3237.40 --> 3238.40]  And Peter, he doesn't wake him up
[3239.40 --> 3240.40]  Peter's still sleeping
[3240.40 --> 3242.40]  So I think this is funny, the angel's like, okay
[3243.40 --> 3244.40]  You know, gives him a whack on the side, wakes him up
[3245.40 --> 3248.40]  The angel tells Peter, get up, get dressed, follow me
[3249.40 --> 3250.40]  Do it quickly
[3250.40 --> 3253.40]  Which does remind us of the Passover
[3253.40 --> 3255.40]  Where the Israelites were to escape quickly
[3256.40 --> 3259.40]  And notice that when the angel comes into the prison to rescue Peter
[3260.40 --> 3262.40]  What is, how does Peter respond?
[3263.40 --> 3264.40]  Peter doesn't say
[3265.40 --> 3266.40]  Great, you're here
[3267.40 --> 3268.40]  Right on time, I knew you were coming
[3269.40 --> 3270.40]  Right? I knew God was going to rescue me
[3271.40 --> 3272.40]  And you showed up
[3273.40 --> 3274.40]  No
[3274.40 --> 3275.40]  What is Peter thinking?
[3275.40 --> 3276.40]  He thinks it's a vision
[3276.40 --> 3278.40]  He is surprised
[3279.40 --> 3280.40]  Right? He's not expecting this
[3281.40 --> 3284.40]  He didn't expect that an angel was going to come and deliver him
[3285.40 --> 3286.40]  But he does
[3287.40 --> 3289.40]  God is working a miracle in this situation
[3290.40 --> 3291.40]  We see that in a couple of ways in this passage
[3292.40 --> 3294.40]  Peter's chains fall off
[3295.40 --> 3300.40]  Right? And then even as they're going through multiple sets of gates and doors
[3300.40 --> 3301.40]  And there are guards
[3301.40 --> 3302.40]  And there are guards
[3302.40 --> 3303.40]  They each one of those gates and doors
[3304.40 --> 3305.40]  The guards don't see anything
[3306.40 --> 3307.40]  They just walk right out
[3307.40 --> 3308.40]  They don't hear anything
[3308.40 --> 3309.40]  They don't see anything
[3309.40 --> 3310.40]  Nobody stops them
[3310.40 --> 3311.40]  They just walk right out
[3312.40 --> 3313.40]  And then when they get to the outer gate
[3314.40 --> 3316.40]  The gate of a jail in a city
[3317.40 --> 3318.40]  That's supposed to keep the prisoners in
[3319.40 --> 3320.40]  That outer gate, it just opens by itself
[3321.40 --> 3322.40]  And Peter's thinking
[3323.40 --> 3324.40]  Yeah, this is a vision
[3325.40 --> 3326.40]  Because this doesn't make any sense
[3326.40 --> 3329.40]  Right? Locked iron gates of prisons
[3329.40 --> 3330.40]  Don't just open by themselves
[3331.40 --> 3334.40]  But Peter, he walks through the door
[3335.40 --> 3338.40]  All of a sudden, he's standing outside on the street
[3339.40 --> 3342.40]  And you know, this is all the miracle that he needed
[3343.40 --> 3344.40]  Because Peter finds himself free
[3345.40 --> 3346.40]  And the angel disappears and leaves him
[3347.40 --> 3348.40]  So what does Peter do?
[3349.40 --> 3350.40]  He's out there, he's free
[3351.40 --> 3353.40]  He goes straight to Mary's house
[3353.40 --> 3356.40]  Which must have been a regular gathering place
[3356.40 --> 3358.40]  For the early Christian community in Jerusalem
[3359.40 --> 3361.40]  He goes and he knocks on the door
[3362.40 --> 3363.40]  And then I think what happens next
[3364.40 --> 3365.40]  Is like straight out of a comedy movie
[3366.40 --> 3367.40]  Because it's the middle of the night
[3368.40 --> 3370.40]  The church is gathered in this house
[3371.40 --> 3372.40]  Praying fervently, earnestly
[3373.40 --> 3374.40]  for Peter's deliverance
[3375.40 --> 3377.40]  And there's a knock on the door
[3378.40 --> 3380.40]  Now imagine what they would have been thinking
[3380.40 --> 3382.40]  Probably they're thinking
[3383.40 --> 3384.40]  They're soldiers
[3385.40 --> 3387.40]  They're soldiers coming to arrest more of us
[3388.40 --> 3389.40]  Just like they did James and Peter
[3390.40 --> 3391.40]  So they're probably feeling a little bit
[3392.40 --> 3393.40]  Kind of, you know, afraid here
[3394.40 --> 3395.40]  So the servant girl, Rhoda
[3396.40 --> 3397.40]  Goes to the door
[3398.40 --> 3399.40]  And she, you know, the door's closed
[3399.40 --> 3400.40]  She hasn't seen Peter
[3401.40 --> 3402.40]  She just calls out through the gate
[3403.40 --> 3404.40]  And says, who's there?
[3405.40 --> 3406.40]  And she hears the response
[3407.40 --> 3408.40]  Maybe even somewhat of a whisper
[3408.40 --> 3411.40]  Because Peter, remember, he's still an outlaw
[3411.40 --> 3413.40]  Soldiers could come and grab him at any minute
[3414.40 --> 3415.40]  Maybe they're out looking for him
[3416.40 --> 3417.40]  And he says, it's Peter
[3418.40 --> 3421.40]  And immediately she recognizes his voice
[3422.40 --> 3423.40]  She knows this is Peter
[3424.40 --> 3425.40]  She doesn't need convincing
[3425.40 --> 3426.40]  And in her shock, in her joy
[3427.40 --> 3428.40]  She can't believe it
[3429.40 --> 3430.40]  She doesn't even open the door, right?
[3431.40 --> 3432.40]  She leaves Peter standing outside
[3433.40 --> 3434.40]  In the danger of soldiers
[3434.40 --> 3435.40]  Who could kind of come by
[3435.40 --> 3436.40]  And catch him at any moment
[3436.40 --> 3438.40]  He's out in the middle of the city
[3438.40 --> 3439.40]  Standing at this door
[3439.40 --> 3440.40]  Looking over his shoulder
[3441.40 --> 3443.40]  And Rhoda runs back inside
[3444.40 --> 3447.40]  And she says, hey, it's Peter at the door
[3448.40 --> 3450.40]  And then they have this whole debate
[3451.40 --> 3452.40]  While Peter is left standing outside
[3453.40 --> 3454.40]  And we know Peter is not very patient
[3455.40 --> 3456.40]  He's probably just like, come on guys
[3457.40 --> 3458.40]  Like, any time now would be great
[3458.40 --> 3459.40]  Let me in
[3460.40 --> 3462.40]  But they're inside arguing with Rhoda
[3462.40 --> 3464.40]  She's saying, it's Peter
[3465.40 --> 3466.40]  And they're saying, no way
[3466.40 --> 3467.40]  You're out of your mind
[3467.40 --> 3469.40]  There's no way it can be Peter
[3471.40 --> 3472.40]  But they finally, they go
[3472.40 --> 3473.40]  And they open the door
[3474.40 --> 3476.40]  And they are amazed, right?
[3476.40 --> 3477.40]  And they're probably
[3478.40 --> 3479.40]  They're so excited
[3479.40 --> 3481.40]  They're probably creating this kind of a commotion
[3482.40 --> 3483.40]  And that's why Peter kind of motions for them
[3483.40 --> 3485.40]  He's like, shh guys, keep it down, you know
[3486.40 --> 3487.40]  I'm a fugitive here
[3488.40 --> 3489.40]  And so he tells them what happened
[3489.40 --> 3491.40]  And what does Peter say
[3492.40 --> 3494.40]  When, about how he was delivered
[3495.40 --> 3497.40]  He says, the Lord delivered me
[3498.40 --> 3500.40]  And we see that in verse 11
[3501.40 --> 3502.40]  Which we can put up here
[3503.40 --> 3504.40]  Verse 11, this is when he's outside on the street
[3505.40 --> 3506.40]  He just got out of the prison
[3507.40 --> 3509.40]  He says this, when he kind of comes to realize what happened
[3510.40 --> 3511.40]  It's not a vision
[3511.40 --> 3513.40]  He says, now I know without a doubt
[3514.40 --> 3515.40]  That the Lord, the Lord
[3515.40 --> 3518.40]  Has sent his angel and rescued me
[3520.40 --> 3522.40]  And then in verse 17
[3523.40 --> 3526.40]  He, you know, Peter's been rescued
[3527.40 --> 3528.40]  He's let in the house
[3528.40 --> 3530.40]  He motions with his hands for them to be quiet
[3531.40 --> 3532.40]  And described how the Lord
[3533.40 --> 3534.40]  Had brought him out of the prison
[3535.40 --> 3538.40]  And then we know that this was just this
[3539.40 --> 3540.40]  Transformative experience for Peter
[3540.40 --> 3542.40]  Because later in his letter
[3542.40 --> 3543.40]  In 2 Peter
[3544.40 --> 3545.40]  Chapter 2 verse 9
[3545.40 --> 3546.40]  He writes
[3547.40 --> 3548.40]  The Lord knows
[3548.40 --> 3550.40]  How to rescue the godly from trials
[3553.40 --> 3555.40]  So after telling them how the Lord delivered him
[3556.40 --> 3559.40]  Peter, he goes and he finds some better place
[3560.40 --> 3561.40]  To stay safe
[3562.40 --> 3563.40]  He goes into hiding until things cool down
[3564.40 --> 3566.40]  And this kind of brings us almost to the end of Peter's story in Acts
[3566.40 --> 3568.40]  Next we see him in chapter 15
[3569.40 --> 3570.40]  Where Paul has to rebuke him
[3571.40 --> 3572.40]  And then we don't see him much after that
[3573.40 --> 3576.40]  But let's not miss what was happening here
[3577.40 --> 3580.40]  The church had been earnestly praying for Peter, right?
[3581.40 --> 3582.40]  They were earnestly praying
[3583.40 --> 3585.40]  They were gathered all throughout the night
[3586.40 --> 3587.40]  Praying and pleading for God
[3588.40 --> 3590.40]  To miraculously intervene and save Peter
[3591.40 --> 3593.40]  Lord, please don't take Peter
[3593.40 --> 3594.40]  Deliver him
[3595.40 --> 3596.40]  You are able
[3597.40 --> 3598.40]  Save Peter
[3599.40 --> 3602.40]  And then when Rhoda runs in joyfully into the house
[3603.40 --> 3604.40]  And announced Peter's here
[3605.40 --> 3606.40]  What was their response?
[3607.40 --> 3608.40]  Did they say
[3609.40 --> 3610.40]  Of course he is
[3611.40 --> 3612.40]  Right?
[3612.40 --> 3613.40]  After all we've been praying for his deliverance
[3614.40 --> 3618.40]  You know, was theirs a response of belief and faith
[3618.40 --> 3621.40]  That God could really answer their prayers
[3622.40 --> 3623.40]  And intervene in a miraculous way?
[3624.40 --> 3626.40]  Well, no, not really
[3627.40 --> 3628.40]  Right? Their response was
[3629.40 --> 3630.40]  You are out of your mind
[3631.40 --> 3633.40]  There's no way
[3634.40 --> 3635.40]  Peter's standing at the gate
[3636.40 --> 3637.40]  Right? There's no way in other words
[3638.40 --> 3639.40]  That God actually answered us
[3640.40 --> 3642.40]  Right? So that's what's happening here
[3642.40 --> 3644.40]  The church is earnestly praying
[3644.40 --> 3646.40]  And yet they're in complete disbelief
[3647.40 --> 3648.40]  That what they actually
[3649.40 --> 3651.40]  That what they prayed for actually happens
[3652.40 --> 3653.40]  Can you relate to that?
[3654.40 --> 3656.40]  Right? Can you relate to praying earnestly
[3657.40 --> 3658.40]  For God to do something in your life
[3658.40 --> 3659.40]  Or in the life of another person
[3660.40 --> 3662.40]  To intervene in a miraculous way
[3663.40 --> 3664.40]  Or to intervene in the church
[3665.40 --> 3666.40]  Or in the world
[3667.40 --> 3668.40]  But not really deep down believing
[3668.40 --> 3670.40]  That God is going to come through
[3671.40 --> 3673.40]  Right? Praying as though you believe
[3674.40 --> 3675.40]  God can accomplish
[3676.40 --> 3677.40]  What you are asking him to do
[3678.40 --> 3680.40]  We believe in God's sovereignty over all things
[3681.40 --> 3682.40]  But believing in your heart
[3683.40 --> 3684.40]  That almost certainly he's not going to do it
[3685.40 --> 3686.40]  Right? I can relate to that
[3687.40 --> 3690.40]  Right? Will God really lead and guide me
[3691.40 --> 3692.40]  In my life as I ask him to?
[3693.40 --> 3695.40]  Right? Will God change the heart of my children?
[3695.40 --> 3698.40]  Will God answer my prayers for someone's healing?
[3699.40 --> 3704.40]  You know, perhaps this is somewhat what these disciples were feeling
[3705.40 --> 3707.40]  Especially after James had just been executed
[3708.40 --> 3710.40]  Right? God had to intervene then
[3710.40 --> 3711.40]  Why should they expect him to now?
[3712.40 --> 3715.40]  Maybe that's what they were feeling on this particular night
[3716.40 --> 3718.40]  Even as they were gathering to pray
[3719.40 --> 3723.40]  Right? And then Peter shows up like a ghost at their gate
[3723.40 --> 3727.40]  But what is abundantly clear from this passage
[3728.40 --> 3730.40]  Is that God most certainly is able
[3731.40 --> 3733.40]  To intervene in our lives and in our circumstances
[3734.40 --> 3735.40]  In miraculous ways
[3736.40 --> 3737.40]  He is able
[3738.40 --> 3739.40]  Right? As Paul says in Ephesians chapter 3
[3740.40 --> 3745.40]  He is able to do far more abundantly than all we can ask or think
[3746.40 --> 3747.40]  Right? More abundantly than we can ask
[3747.40 --> 3751.40]  And the lesson that the church was learning in the case of Peter
[3752.40 --> 3754.40]  Was that that precisely is true
[3755.40 --> 3758.40]  God is able to do far more abundantly
[3759.40 --> 3761.40]  And friends, we need to remember that as well
[3762.40 --> 3765.40]  As children of our Heavenly Father
[3766.40 --> 3768.40]  God invites us to ask
[3768.40 --> 3769.40]  To ask
[3769.40 --> 3770.40]  He invites us to bring
[3770.40 --> 3771.40]  To ask him for anything
[3772.40 --> 3774.40]  For he invites us to ask him for everything
[3775.40 --> 3778.40]  That is in accordance with his character and his promises
[3779.40 --> 3780.40]  He wants us to ask him
[3781.40 --> 3783.40]  And then to trust him for the outcome
[3783.40 --> 3784.40]  Whatever it is
[3785.40 --> 3787.40]  And to not end up where we say
[3787.40 --> 3790.40]  Child you did not receive because you did not ask
[3790.40 --> 3793.40]  We can ask him in faith
[3794.40 --> 3795.40]  Accepting
[3796.40 --> 3797.40]  His answer might be no
[3797.40 --> 3798.40]  It might be yes
[3799.40 --> 3800.40]  But we can ask
[3800.40 --> 3802.40]  And we can know that he is able to do it
[3803.40 --> 3806.40]  And that brings us to the final part of this story
[3807.40 --> 3808.40]  With what happens to Herod
[3809.40 --> 3811.40]  So Herod is the third character that we see here
[3812.40 --> 3814.40]  And we see that in Acts chapter 12, our passage
[3815.40 --> 3816.40]  It begins with Herod killing James
[3816.40 --> 3819.40]  But in the story ends with the Lord striking down Herod
[3819.40 --> 3820.40]  And putting Herod to death
[3821.40 --> 3823.40]  So Herod, you know the story
[3823.40 --> 3824.40]  He goes to Tyre and Sidon
[3825.40 --> 3826.40]  He gives this public address
[3827.40 --> 3829.40]  And he gives them this great speech
[3829.40 --> 3832.40]  That talks about how amazing he is
[3833.40 --> 3835.40]  How his greatness, his kindness to these people
[3836.40 --> 3837.40]  Who don't really think Herod is that great at all
[3838.40 --> 3841.40]  But they recognize that they are in a position of dependence
[3842.40 --> 3845.40]  And so they cry out the voice of a God and not a man
[3846.40 --> 3848.40]  Right, the people exclaim him as a God
[3849.40 --> 3850.40]  Maybe knowing his character
[3851.40 --> 3853.40]  Right, they are just trying to flatter him
[3853.40 --> 3854.40]  To win his approval, butter him up
[3855.40 --> 3857.40]  But Herod takes the glory to himself
[3858.40 --> 3859.40]  Right, he accepts their praise
[3860.40 --> 3861.40]  He is like, yeah, you know, I am a God
[3862.40 --> 3863.40]  I am a king
[3864.40 --> 3865.40]  And an angel shows up for Herod in that moment
[3866.40 --> 3867.40]  Just like he showed up for Peter
[3868.40 --> 3869.40]  But this time Herod is not here to rescue
[3870.40 --> 3872.40]  He is here to bear God's judgment against Herod
[3872.40 --> 3875.40]  And so whereas it was Peter
[3876.40 --> 3878.40]  Whose life was on the line in the beginning of the story
[3879.40 --> 3881.40]  Now it is Herod who loses his life
[3882.40 --> 3886.40]  So not only is God able to deliver those who belong to him
[3887.40 --> 3890.40]  He is equally able to destroy and bring to an end
[3891.40 --> 3893.40]  Those who oppose him and who oppress his people
[3893.40 --> 3899.40]  God doesn't always put wicked kings to death immediately, does he?
[3900.40 --> 3903.40]  But ultimately, those who oppose God
[3904.40 --> 3906.40]  Those who set themselves up as rival gods
[3907.40 --> 3908.40]  Will be judged and punished
[3909.40 --> 3911.40]  Right, finally God will judge the wicked
[3912.40 --> 3915.40]  And Herod's death is an anticipation of that final judgment
[3916.40 --> 3918.40]  Here in the present
[3918.40 --> 3922.40]  So what do we learn here from Herod?
[3923.40 --> 3928.40]  What we learn is that God is able not only to miraculously answer prayers on our behalf
[3929.40 --> 3931.40]  Like for our protection and our preservation
[3932.40 --> 3936.40]  He is also able to miraculously answer prayers to intervene in the world
[3937.40 --> 3938.40]  To judge evil
[3939.40 --> 3940.40]  To bring justice to bear
[3941.40 --> 3942.40]  To bring an end to evil
[3943.40 --> 3944.40]  God is able to do that as well
[3944.40 --> 3949.40]  And we learn here that Jesus is the true and only king
[3950.40 --> 3952.40]  Jesus is sovereign over the world
[3953.40 --> 3954.40]  He is the king
[3955.40 --> 3956.40]  His purposes will prevail
[3957.40 --> 3958.40]  And by the power of his Holy Spirit
[3959.40 --> 3960.40]  He is continuing to work in the world
[3961.40 --> 3965.40]  And in that work is he's bringing his salvation to the ends of the earth
[3966.40 --> 3967.40]  And that's how this passage ends, right?
[3968.40 --> 3969.40]  Verse 24 says this
[3970.40 --> 3973.40]  But the word of God continued to spread and flourish
[3974.40 --> 3977.40]  Right, that's the driving drumbeat of the book of Acts
[3978.40 --> 3982.40]  All these things happen and the word of God continued to spread and to flourish
[3983.40 --> 3986.40]  Right, Acts 12 begins with this threat to the gospel
[3987.40 --> 3988.40]  To the word of God
[3989.40 --> 3992.40]  Right, Herod is trying to stop the movement of God in the world
[3992.40 --> 3994.40]  He's putting James to death
[3995.40 --> 3996.40]  He's intending to kill Peter
[3997.40 --> 3998.40]  But it ends with God
[3999.40 --> 4003.40]  Allowing James to die for his good purposes
[4004.40 --> 4006.40]  Allowing Peter to be set free
[4007.40 --> 4008.40]  Putting Herod to death
[4009.40 --> 4011.40]  And all the...why...why all this is happening?
[4012.40 --> 4013.40]  You know, what's going on here?
[4014.40 --> 4015.40]  What's God doing?
[4016.40 --> 4017.40]  The word of God continues to spread and flourish
[4017.40 --> 4018.40]  That's why
[4018.40 --> 4022.40]  So what is the word of the gospel for us today?
[4023.40 --> 4027.40]  Right, what is this gospel message that continued to go forth?
[4028.40 --> 4032.40]  It is that we have a God who has entered fully into our suffering
[4033.40 --> 4034.40]  And he made it his own
[4035.40 --> 4038.40]  Right, he's not immune to the suffering that we experience
[4039.40 --> 4041.40]  He purposefully entered into it
[4041.40 --> 4043.40]  And the good news, friends, that Jesus Christ
[4044.40 --> 4045.40]  As Peter himself says
[4046.40 --> 4047.40]  He also suffered once for sins
[4048.40 --> 4049.40]  The righteous for the unrighteous
[4050.40 --> 4051.40]  To bring you to God
[4052.40 --> 4054.40]  That is the good news of the gospel
[4057.40 --> 4059.40]  I love the words of Psalm 139
[4060.40 --> 4061.40]  Verse 12
[4061.40 --> 4062.40]  And I'll just close with this
[4063.40 --> 4065.40]  It says, even the darkness is not dark to you
[4065.40 --> 4068.40]  The night is as bright as the day
[4069.40 --> 4071.40]  For darkness is as light with you
[4074.40 --> 4075.40]  Right, maybe right now
[4076.40 --> 4079.40]  You find yourself in the darkness
[4080.40 --> 4083.40]  Right, maybe for you right now it is the night
[4084.40 --> 4087.40]  But friends, the darkness is not dark to God
[4088.40 --> 4091.40]  Right, our darkness is light to Him
[4091.40 --> 4095.40]  That means He sees, He knows, He knows what's going on
[4096.40 --> 4098.40]  And He is in complete control
[4099.40 --> 4101.40]  There's nothing to fear for God
[4102.40 --> 4104.40]  In the Lord we have light
[4105.40 --> 4109.40]  And the Lord calls upon us in these dark days
[4110.40 --> 4111.40]  To cling to Him
[4112.40 --> 4115.40]  To trust Him as our light and our salvation
[4116.40 --> 4117.40]  Okay, so let's pray together
[4117.40 --> 4124.40]  Our Father, we ask that you would help us to learn in every situation how to pray
[4125.40 --> 4127.40]  How to rest in your power
[4128.40 --> 4133.40]  How to have confidence that you really can do more than anything that we could even ask or imagine
[4134.40 --> 4140.40]  And Lord, would you surprise us in the coming days, in the coming weeks
[4140.40 --> 4148.40]  By the touch of your grace in places and in people that we would never expect to have it
[4149.40 --> 4157.40]  And Lord, would you help us to hold on to you in the midst of situations that seem, humanly speaking, to be desperate
[4157.40 --> 4161.40]  Because Lord, we know that you can do all things
[4161.40 --> 4166.40]  And you will accomplish all things according to your good purposes
[4167.40 --> 4169.40]  For us and for your glory
[4170.40 --> 4171.40]  Hear us, O Lord
[4172.40 --> 4173.40]  And help us as we pray
[4174.40 --> 4175.40]  We pray in Jesus' name
[4176.40 --> 4177.40]  Amen
[4177.40 --> 4188.40]  All right, so worship leaders will come back up and let's stand and we'll sing our song of response to this message
[4188.40 --> 4189.40]  Let's stand and sing
[4189.40 --> 4190.40]  Amen

[4202.40 --> 4208.40]  Amen
[4208.40 --> 4215.40]  God was in Amos
[4215.40 --> 4220.80]  mysterious way his wonders to the fold.
[4223.38 --> 4230.74]  He plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm.
[4235.90 --> 4243.74]  Deep in unfathomable eyes of never-failing scale,
[4243.74 --> 4253.74]  he treasures up his bright design and works his sovereign way.
[4255.74 --> 4263.74]  Take courage, my beautiful saints, let clouds be so much more.
[4263.74 --> 4269.74]  With mercy I shall pray in blessings on your hand.
[4269.74 --> 4276.74]  And I will trust in the hands that came to starry heavens.
[4276.74 --> 4281.74]  And I will trust in the wounds of Calvary.
[4281.74 --> 4288.74]  And I will trust in the Lord, be afraid.
[4288.74 --> 4293.74]  For all his ways are mine.
[4293.74 --> 4308.74]  And I will trust in the Lord by fablescence, but trust him for his grace.
[4308.74 --> 4320.74]  Behind the frowning covenant, he hides a smiling face.
[4320.74 --> 4332.74]  His purposes will I confess, unfolding every other one may have a bitter taste.
[4332.74 --> 4336.74]  But still will be the fire.
[4336.74 --> 4342.74]  And I will trust in the hands that made us starry heavens.
[4342.74 --> 4349.74]  And I will trust in the wounds of Calvary.
[4349.74 --> 4354.74]  And I will trust in the wounds of Calvary.
[4354.74 --> 4355.74]  And I will trust in the wounds of Calvary.
[4355.74 --> 4361.74]  And I will trust in the hands that came to starry heavens.
[4361.74 --> 4367.74]  And I will trust in the wounds of Calvary.
[4367.74 --> 4374.74]  And I will trust in the hands that came to starry.
[4374.74 --> 4378.74]  And I will trust in the peonidas of Calvary.
[4378.74 --> 4380.74]  And I will trust in the floors of Calvary.
[4380.74 --> 4390.74]  Not be afraid, not be afraid.
[4390.74 --> 4420.72]  For all His ways are mine.
[4420.74 --> 4429.16]  So we'll continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4430.30 --> 4437.86]  Our designated offering for this Sunday is King's University, which is a university,
[4438.68 --> 4443.42]  is it, what does it say, Edmonton, that is part of the Christian Reformed Church.
[4443.78 --> 4446.52]  So we support that ministry to college students.
[4446.98 --> 4449.96]  And may I invite the deacons to come forward and collect the offering.
[4450.74 --> 4452.74]  Amen.
[4480.74 --> 4482.74]  Amen.
[4482.74 --> 4484.74]  Amen.
[4484.74 --> 4486.74]  Amen.
[4486.74 --> 4488.74]  Amen.
[4488.74 --> 4490.74]  Amen.
[4490.74 --> 4494.74]  Amen.
[4494.74 --> 4496.74]  Amen.
[4496.74 --> 4498.74]  Amen.
[4498.74 --> 4500.74]  Amen.
[4500.74 --> 4502.74]  Amen.
[4502.74 --> 4504.74]  Amen.
[4504.74 --> 4508.74]  Amen.
[4508.74 --> 4510.74]  Amen.
[4510.74 --> 4514.74]  Yes.
[4514.74 --> 4544.72]  Thank you.
[4544.74 --> 4574.72]  Thank you.
[4574.74 --> 4604.72]  Thank you.
[4604.74 --> 4634.72]  Thank you.
[4634.74 --> 4636.74]  Thank you.
[4636.74 --> 4638.74]  Thank you.
[4638.74 --> 4645.52]  Yes, I was going to say something too, but then it's like, wow, it's kind of biased, right?
[4646.84 --> 4648.06]  Anyways, that was very nice.
[4648.06 --> 4659.20]  On a more serious note, I have to announce to you the deaths of two people connected
[4659.20 --> 4660.06]  with our congregation.
[4660.06 --> 4665.10]  First, Shirley's sister, Phyllis, passed away yesterday.
[4665.10 --> 4676.94]  She was in the hospital at the age of, I think, 79 or so, 74, and in Ohio in the U.S.
[4676.94 --> 4681.16]  And, of course, we're very saddened by that news.
[4681.16 --> 4695.42]  And also, Peter, Peter Krusinga, passed away suddenly last night at 11 p.m. from a heart
[4695.42 --> 4695.80]  attack.
[4695.80 --> 4698.70]  So, our hearts are very heavy.
[4698.70 --> 4704.14]  And our prayers are with Pat, of course, and other family members.
[4705.14 --> 4711.62]  And so, let's now just come before the Lord and let's pray for these families and pray for
[4711.62 --> 4712.98]  God's comfort and his mercy.
[4712.98 --> 4727.00]  Oh, Lord, we do cry out to you, Lord, because you are the God who is the light in our darkness.
[4728.30 --> 4730.66]  And, Lord, nothing is hidden from your sight.
[4731.36 --> 4733.62]  You know the suffering of your children.
[4734.82 --> 4740.98]  And so, Lord, we lift up to you, Shirley, especially in all the family, Lord, as they mourn the loss
[4740.98 --> 4742.50]  of Shirley's sister.
[4742.98 --> 4750.48]  But, Lord, we thank you that she is now in the joy of seeing you face to face.
[4750.72 --> 4753.28]  And, Lord, that is the hope of each one of us.
[4754.52 --> 4759.86]  And, Lord, we pray the same for Pat, Lord, at the sudden loss of Peter.
[4761.24 --> 4770.42]  Lord, we just pray for your immense love and comfort to be with Pat, to fill her heart,
[4770.42 --> 4773.76]  giving her the peace that surpasses all of our understanding.
[4774.92 --> 4778.96]  And, Lord, would you bind up and strengthen her heart even now.
[4779.86 --> 4783.16]  Lord, as she mourns Peter's passing.
[4783.16 --> 4787.38]  And, Lord, be with her in the days and weeks to come as well.
[4788.64 --> 4791.66]  Lord, help us as a church to walk beside her.
[4791.66 --> 4801.02]  And, Lord, we also, we just thank you for this chance that we have this morning to be in your presence.
[4801.02 --> 4808.48]  And we thank you that though we have rebelled and fallen short of your righteousness time and time again,
[4809.48 --> 4811.30]  that we are made whole in you.
[4811.94 --> 4819.22]  That ultimately that neither life nor death nor anything can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.
[4819.22 --> 4830.74]  Lord, you have made us, you have redeemed us, and you promise that we will be forever with you, both now and in the life to come.
[4831.38 --> 4836.78]  So thank you, Lord, for your awesome power, Lord, that turns decay into new creation.
[4838.68 --> 4842.68]  And, Lord, we pray for this whole world to be reconciled to you.
[4842.68 --> 4852.00]  That you would be filling us, your people, with your Holy Spirit to join you in this work, even until, unto the ends of the earth.
[4853.30 --> 4860.66]  We pray for those who, Lord, in this world experience struggles meeting their basic needs.
[4861.48 --> 4865.14]  For those who are dealing with tight finances or struggling to find work.
[4865.88 --> 4867.92]  For those who need adequate housing.
[4867.92 --> 4873.54]  Would you provide these necessities, even, Lord, as you do for the birds and the lilies.
[4875.76 --> 4878.34]  Lord, we pray for conflicts, big and small.
[4879.78 --> 4885.18]  We pray that you would restore broken relationships and heal the hurts they have caused.
[4885.92 --> 4891.32]  Whether it is conflicts in families, workplaces, or friendships.
[4892.56 --> 4895.00]  Fill your people with your grace and forgiveness.
[4895.00 --> 4903.60]  Help us to be peacemakers as we follow our Lord Jesus, who made peace for us with our Heavenly Father.
[4904.84 --> 4909.36]  And for large-scale conflict, Lord, we acknowledge you as the true king of the whole world.
[4910.18 --> 4913.72]  And we know that the hearts of rulers on this earth are in your hands.
[4915.18 --> 4917.74]  And so, Lord, would you end conflicts around the world.
[4917.74 --> 4924.84]  And especially, Lord, in light of our passage today, we pray that you would end the persecution of Christians around the world.
[4925.46 --> 4928.54]  Especially in places like Iran and China.
[4929.62 --> 4934.00]  We pray for believers who are even right now perhaps sitting in a jail cell.
[4935.14 --> 4937.12]  We pray for your speedy deliverance.
[4937.78 --> 4940.52]  And that you would strengthen their hearts to trust in you.
[4940.52 --> 4946.86]  Lord, we also pray for your kingdom to grow in Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[4947.86 --> 4951.50]  Lord, we ask that you would guide us as a church family.
[4952.26 --> 4954.56]  Help us to discern your will in all things.
[4955.36 --> 4959.02]  And we ask that you would help us to grow in the knowledge and love of our Lord Jesus.
[4960.08 --> 4966.52]  And that through our witness that you would call more people to yourself and into our church fellowship.
[4966.52 --> 4970.90]  Lord, we look forward to the day when your kingdom fully comes.
[4971.22 --> 4973.16]  When all tears will be wiped away.
[4973.76 --> 4977.26]  When all things will be healed and restored.
[4978.40 --> 4984.10]  And until that day, Lord, empower us to follow you in the world for your glory.
[4985.22 --> 4986.42]  We ask these things.
[4987.00 --> 4990.96]  The name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and our King.
[4992.44 --> 4992.84]  Amen.
[4992.84 --> 4992.94]  Amen.
[4992.94 --> 4997.50]  Let's stand.
[4999.68 --> 5001.52]  And let's hear the Lord's benediction.
[5002.76 --> 5004.84]  From 1 Peter chapter 5.
[5005.50 --> 5008.34]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving his blessing.
[5009.38 --> 5011.58]  Friends, after you have suffered a little while,
[5012.44 --> 5013.74]  the God of all grace,
[5014.28 --> 5017.22]  who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
[5017.22 --> 5023.84]  will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
[5024.52 --> 5027.16]  May you rest now in the gracious will of God.
[5027.96 --> 5028.44]  Amen.
[5029.72 --> 5031.16]  So please remain standing.
[5031.28 --> 5032.34]  We'll sing our final song.
[5032.44 --> 5034.80]  And afterwards, we invite you to join us for a time of fellowship,
[5035.16 --> 5037.04]  right through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[5037.04 --> 5041.52]  And so let's sing our final song.
[5041.52 --> 5056.70]  The sermon.
[5056.70 --> 5066.40]  Let our true faith confess that the people of God from this dwelling came clear.
[5066.40 --> 5078.90]  The supper is ended on how we extend the fruits of His service in all of His name.
[5078.90 --> 5091.40]  The seed of Christ, teaching, receptus of speech, shall pass through redemption for God and for all.
[5091.40 --> 5104.40]  Your grace shall live silence, your love shall unite us to work for your kingdom and answer your call.
[5104.40 --> 5116.90]  With praise and thanksgiving to God ever live, the tasks of our everyday life we face.
[5117.90 --> 5128.90]  Our faith ever sharing in love ever hearing, embracing our children from all year and race.
[5128.90 --> 5136.06]  Let God's days to feed us with your light, now lead us.
[5136.06 --> 5142.20]  Unite us as one and best let every share.
[5142.70 --> 5147.90]  Then may all the living with praise and thanksgiving.
[5148.90 --> 5154.90]  Keep honor to my stand, His feet that we bear.
[5154.90 --> 5159.90]  Unite us as one and best let every share.
[5159.90 --> 5162.76]  Unite us as one and best let every share.
[5162.76 --> 5168.04]  Unite us as one and best let every share.
[5168.04 --> 5173.70]  Unite us as one and best let every share.
[5173.70 --> 5177.90]  A special temple from all the deeds of God on this.
[5177.90 --> 5182.90]  God is always to whoever supporting us through faith we find another union in our defense and our religion in our Et unreal eyes together.
[5182.90 --> 5183.90]  Amen.
[5212.90 --> 5213.90]  Amen.
