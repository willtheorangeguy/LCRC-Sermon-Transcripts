• The church should be centred and anchored in who Jesus is and what he has done
• God's mission includes renewing lives, relationships, and the world
• Jesus gives his disciples a mission to continue his work after his ascension
• The five aspects of the mission are:
  • Who: Disciples of Jesus called to participate in his mission
  • What: Continuation of Jesus' work on earth
  • Where: Throughout the world, among all people
  • How: By living out Jesus' teachings and ways
  • Why: To bring glory to God and redeem humanity
• The passage from scripture discusses the calling of disciples to Jesus' mission
• Disciples are called to learn Jesus' ways and be continually formed in Christ
• The two questions addressed in the passage are "who" and "what", specifically who is called to the mission and what is the mission itself
• The answer to the first question is that Jesus sends out disciples, and as Christians, we are all disciples
• The second question's answer is that the mission is to make disciples, with the command being to go and make disciples as one goes
• This passage is often referred to as "The Great Commission"
• However, it is noted that this phrase was not originally used in this context and gained popularity through missionary William Carey in the 1800s
• Mission church where everyone is called to the mission given by Jesus
• Matthew chapter 9 passage about praying for workers and Jesus sending them out
• Importance of individual "going ness" in a mission church
• Living out the Great Commission in ordinary life as missionaries
• Understanding where God is calling individuals to go, with the ultimate goal of spreading the kingdom of God
• Jesus' instruction to go to all nations, meaning every people group and culture, with no barriers or restrictions.
• Jesus commissions his disciples to make disciples of all nations
• The church has grown from a small group to over 2 billion disciples worldwide since Jesus' mission was given
• The church's primary mission is to make disciples, not secondary concerns like community gardens or maintaining existing churches
• The process of making disciples involves sending people out to tell others about the Good Shepherd and baptizing them
• Jesus provides two primary ways to make disciples: going out to reach new nations and people (making disciples), and baptizing those who become believers.
• Baptism as a sign and seal of being brought into fellowship with God and the church
• Discipleship as a lifelong process of learning to obey Jesus' commands
• The importance of teaching and discipleship in making disciples
• The role of the church in spreading the gospel and making disciples
• Jesus' authority and sovereignty over all creation, including his ability to make disciples
• The church's involvement in making disciples is a privilege and a calling from God, not a necessity.
• Discussion about floating down a river and following Jesus' mission
• Matthew 16:18 referenced, mentioning Jesus building his church and gates of Hades not overcoming it
• Comparison made between grabbing an inner tube to float on the river and participating in God's great mission
• Call to Christians to be bold, take risks, serve sacrificially, and participate in Jesus' mission
