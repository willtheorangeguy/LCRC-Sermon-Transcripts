[1709.58 → 1739.56] please read it.
[1739.58 → 1769.56] Let's say it.
[1769.56 → 1799.54] Thank you.
[1799.54 → 1829.52] Thank you.
[1829.52 → 1859.50] That's okay.
[1859.50 → 1889.48] Thank you.
[1889.48 → 1919.46] Thank you.
[1919.46 → 1949.44] Thank you.
[1949.44 → 1979.42] Thank you.
[1979.42 → 2009.40] Father, we thank you.
[2009.40 → 2039.38] Thank you.
[2039.38 → 2069.36] Thank you.
[2069.36 → 2099.36] Thank you.
[2099.36 → 2129.36] Thank you.
[2129.36 → 2159.34] So, you know,
[2159.34 → 2189.34] thank you.
[2189.34 → 2219.32] Thank you.
[2219.32 → 2249.30] offer the sacrifice,
[2249.30 → 2279.28] you, you know,
[2279.28 → 2309.26] and you, you know,
[2309.26 → 2339.24] and you, you know,
[2339.24 → 2369.22] and you, you know,
[2369.22 → 2399.20] and you, you know,
[2399.20 → 2429.18] and you, you know, you know,
[2429.18 → 2459.18] you, you have, you know, you, you, you, you, and you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, button, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, and, you, you, you, you, understand,
[2459.18 → 2464.08] And that's what happened to 11 of Jesus' 12 disciples.
[2464.78 → 2467.96] They died as martyrs because of their devotion to Jesus.
[2468.64 → 2473.10] And then the 12th one, John, died in exile on the island of Patmos.
[2474.48 → 2477.96] And persecution, it was such a pressing issue for the churches
[2477.96 → 2482.54] in the life of the early church that we see this all throughout Paul's letters.
[2483.00 → 2485.42] We see in 2 Timothy 3, verse 12,
[2485.42 → 2490.74] everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[2493.02 → 2497.04] But lest we think that this was only an ancient reality,
[2497.42 → 2499.10] let's talk about the situation today.
[2500.26 → 2503.50] There's this non-profit organization called Open Doors.
[2503.92 → 2508.66] And they track, and they report how Christians throughout the world experience persecution.
[2509.04 → 2511.26] And they talk about persecution in two ways.
[2511.26 → 2515.88] They talk about the smash and the squeeze.
[2516.98 → 2521.76] So they define smash as any act of violent persecution.
[2522.72 → 2526.22] And then they define squeeze as this kind of persecution that occurs
[2526.22 → 2531.40] when cultures and governments make life difficult for Christians.
[2531.94 → 2534.28] And I want us to hold on to this framework
[2534.28 → 2538.56] because I think it is really helpful as a way to talk about persecution.
[2539.02 → 2540.14] Smash and squeeze.
[2540.14 → 2543.30] So now when it comes to the smash,
[2543.86 → 2545.64] Open Doors reports that today,
[2546.14 → 2549.76] that there are more than 360 million Christians
[2549.76 → 2552.14] in over 50 countries
[2552.14 → 2556.86] who experience what they call high levels of persecution.
[2557.90 → 2562.06] And so that is about 1 in 12 Christians worldwide.
[2562.96 → 2567.96] 1 in 12 experience high levels of persecution.
[2567.96 → 2571.12] Moreover, they report that last year,
[2571.12 → 2577.58] in 2022, more than 5,600 Christians were murdered for their faith.
[2577.58 → 2581.36] Over 2,000 churches were attacked.
[2581.36 → 2584.80] More than 5,000 Christians were abducted.
[2584.80 → 2593.08] And so this is as relevant today as it was in the time of the Roman Empire.
[2593.08 → 2599.30] At the church I served in when I was living in Taiwan,
[2599.30 → 2602.62] I was teaching a Sunday school class about peacemaking.
[2602.62 → 2605.62] And one of the guys in the class,
[2605.62 → 2608.06] he was a PhD student from Indonesia.
[2609.06 → 2611.18] And he shared that a few years ago,
[2611.30 → 2615.16] a group of men burst into his church on a Sunday morning during worship
[2615.16 → 2618.70] and killed the pastor with a machete.
[2618.70 → 2621.00] And then he asked me,
[2621.48 → 2627.18] how do we apply the principles of peacemaking to this situation?
[2631.40 → 2632.98] I don't remember what I said.
[2633.06 → 2635.76] I don't think I would have known what to say.
[2638.00 → 2644.50] But that's just another example of how Christians around the world today experience the smash.
[2644.50 → 2651.10] And organizations like Open Doors tell us that this type of persecution is the highest it's ever been.
[2652.56 → 2656.10] And then many more countries around the world experience the squeeze.
[2657.38 → 2661.42] When I was in seminary, I had a few classmates from Taiwan
[2661.42 → 2665.12] who gave their testimonies during the chapel.
[2666.02 → 2670.10] And they talked about the deep pain and the struggle
[2670.10 → 2675.36] of being disowned by their parents for becoming Christians.
[2675.92 → 2679.52] Because it usually meant in that culture when you became a Christian,
[2679.92 → 2682.94] you would not participate in ancestor worship.
[2684.08 → 2687.64] And that caused great conflict within the family.
[2690.04 → 2691.68] Many places around the world,
[2691.84 → 2694.16] there is tremendous cultural pressure
[2694.16 → 2697.18] that makes it challenging to be a Christian.
[2697.18 → 2700.18] So now what about here?
[2700.46 → 2701.28] What about Canada?
[2703.20 → 2705.90] You know where we have relative safety
[2705.90 → 2708.44] and relative freedom.
[2709.34 → 2711.48] Do we have a place in this story?
[2711.56 → 2713.10] How do we apply Jesus' words,
[2713.22 → 2715.22] blessed are the persecuted, to us?
[2715.76 → 2717.06] Do we have a place in the story?
[2717.14 → 2718.32] And the answer is yes.
[2719.40 → 2721.30] The odds are that
[2721.30 → 2723.72] you're not going to face the smash.
[2723.72 → 2726.84] Like many Christians have throughout history,
[2726.96 → 2727.66] like Perpetual,
[2728.06 → 2730.16] many of our brothers and sisters around the world.
[2730.94 → 2733.12] But you will likely face the squeeze.
[2733.78 → 2736.64] This constant pressure to compromise
[2736.64 → 2738.84] and to conform to culture.
[2739.40 → 2742.06] And you will likely face ridicule and shame
[2742.06 → 2744.34] should you refuse to do so.
[2745.66 → 2748.48] You know, maybe you've been at a class in university
[2748.48 → 2751.84] and you get ridiculed for taking the Bible seriously.
[2752.84 → 2755.10] Or maybe you're passed over at work
[2755.10 → 2757.42] and somebody else gets promotion
[2757.42 → 2760.66] because they understand the unwritten rules
[2760.66 → 2763.48] about how things really work in the company.
[2764.24 → 2765.48] Although it is not right.
[2766.94 → 2768.58] And so that's the reality of persecution.
[2769.48 → 2771.26] And that has been the experience
[2771.26 → 2773.24] of many of our brothers and sisters
[2773.24 → 2775.74] around the world and throughout history.
[2775.74 → 2777.38] And Jesus tells us up front
[2777.38 → 2780.30] that persecution is an inescapable part
[2780.30 → 2782.06] of following him.
[2782.90 → 2788.66] It is inevitable if you are a disciple of Jesus.
[2789.58 → 2791.74] Okay, so that brings us to the second question,
[2792.40 → 2794.14] the second part of the beatitude this morning,
[2794.24 → 2796.16] which is the reason for persecution.
[2797.04 → 2799.24] Why are Christians persecuted?
[2799.86 → 2801.30] What's the reason for this?
[2802.18 → 2804.54] And we see the answer in verses 10 and 11.
[2804.54 → 2806.80] This is what Jesus says.
[2807.52 → 2807.72] He says,
[2808.06 → 2810.08] Blessed are those who are persecuted.
[2810.26 → 2810.50] Why?
[2811.40 → 2812.68] For righteousness' sake.
[2813.38 → 2815.66] Blessed are you when people insult you,
[2815.82 → 2816.62] persecute you,
[2816.70 → 2819.60] and falsely say all kinds of evil against you
[2819.60 → 2821.06] because of me.
[2822.82 → 2824.52] So we should first be clear
[2824.52 → 2827.94] about what this beatitude isn't saying.
[2828.66 → 2829.98] It does not say,
[2829.98 → 2831.84] Blessed are those who are persecuted
[2831.84 → 2834.44] for being difficult.
[2834.54 → 2837.22] It does not say,
[2837.54 → 2839.76] Blessed are you if people speak evil against you
[2839.76 → 2842.48] for being obnoxious and being annoying,
[2843.42 → 2846.82] or being belligerent and being unloving.
[2847.46 → 2847.56] Right?
[2847.60 → 2848.86] That's not what he's talking about.
[2849.08 → 2850.26] He's not saying, of course,
[2850.88 → 2851.10] you know,
[2851.18 → 2852.82] blessed are you if you sin
[2852.82 → 2855.12] and then have to face the consequences of your sin.
[2855.12 → 2858.04] What Jesus describes here
[2858.04 → 2858.82] is that we are blessed
[2858.82 → 2859.80] when we are persecuted
[2859.80 → 2861.54] for righteousness' sake.
[2862.28 → 2863.40] And in Matthew's gospel,
[2863.82 → 2865.68] a person is described as righteous
[2865.68 → 2867.12] when their whole being,
[2867.22 → 2869.54] their heart, soul, mind, and strength
[2869.54 → 2871.98] aligns with God's will
[2871.98 → 2873.50] and God's character
[2873.50 → 2874.84] and God's kingdom.
[2874.84 → 2876.76] And what that means is
[2876.76 → 2877.80] you are blessed
[2877.80 → 2879.86] when the persecution is taking place
[2879.86 → 2881.02] because your life
[2881.02 → 2882.68] is looking more like Jesus
[2882.68 → 2886.26] and you are being faithful to him.
[2887.00 → 2889.06] Now, why does that lead to persecution?
[2889.30 → 2891.64] Why does changing our lives,
[2891.72 → 2893.34] becoming a different kind of person,
[2894.40 → 2896.32] following Jesus,
[2896.48 → 2897.76] being aligned with his kingdom,
[2898.08 → 2899.90] why does that lead to persecution?
[2899.90 → 2902.36] Well, Jesus tells us.
[2902.44 → 2904.62] He tells us in John 15 again.
[2904.74 → 2906.20] He says it here in verse 19.
[2907.32 → 2907.72] He says,
[2908.06 → 2909.98] If you belonged to the world,
[2910.08 → 2911.84] it would love you as its own.
[2914.08 → 2915.10] As it is,
[2915.66 → 2916.94] you do not belong to the world.
[2917.86 → 2919.94] But I have chosen you out of the world.
[2920.42 → 2922.72] That is why the world hates you.
[2924.14 → 2925.40] So Jesus is saying,
[2925.54 → 2926.96] if you are his disciple,
[2927.56 → 2929.36] if God has chosen you,
[2929.36 → 2931.18] you don't belong to this world.
[2931.44 → 2932.50] You belong to Jesus
[2932.50 → 2934.34] and you are a citizen of his kingdom.
[2935.26 → 2936.90] And the kingdoms of this world
[2936.90 → 2938.04] and the God's kingdom,
[2938.16 → 2938.96] the kingdom of heaven,
[2939.24 → 2940.42] are in conflict.
[2941.62 → 2942.78] So long ago,
[2943.56 → 2945.24] Augustine, also from North Africa,
[2945.68 → 2947.06] he helped us to understand
[2947.06 → 2948.60] this most fundamental,
[2949.20 → 2951.08] the deepest level of division
[2951.08 → 2952.52] and conflict in our world.
[2953.12 → 2953.94] And he went past
[2953.94 → 2955.88] all the surface levels of conflict
[2955.88 → 2957.06] that we see and experience
[2957.06 → 2958.48] and he pressed down
[2958.48 → 2959.62] into what is really
[2959.62 → 2961.66] at the root of it all.
[2962.72 → 2964.38] He said the human race
[2964.38 → 2967.02] is divided into two cities.
[2967.70 → 2968.78] Today we might say
[2968.78 → 2969.84] two identities.
[2970.64 → 2972.04] But he said it's like two cities.
[2972.18 → 2973.64] So here's what he wrote.
[2974.76 → 2977.10] Two cities have been formed
[2977.10 → 2978.22] by two loves.
[2979.28 → 2980.20] The earthly
[2980.20 → 2982.08] by the love of self,
[2982.08 → 2984.38] even to the contempt of God.
[2985.04 → 2985.80] In the heavenly,
[2985.96 → 2986.90] by the love of God,
[2986.94 → 2989.06] even to the contempt of self.
[2990.00 → 2992.50] The earthly city glorifies in itself.
[2993.30 → 2995.14] The heavenly city glorifies in the Lord.
[2995.14 → 2997.90] The one who seeks glory from men,
[2997.94 → 2999.26] the one seeks glory from men.
[2999.72 → 3000.90] The greatest glory
[3000.90 → 3001.98] of the other
[3001.98 → 3003.40] is God.
[3004.56 → 3007.22] The one lifts its head
[3007.22 → 3008.64] in its own glory.
[3008.64 → 3011.34] The other says to its God,
[3011.50 → 3012.48] you are my glory.
[3013.48 → 3014.14] The lifter
[3014.14 → 3015.56] of my head.
[3016.60 → 3017.68] It's a beautiful quote.
[3019.36 → 3019.66] And friends,
[3019.76 → 3020.94] that is the dividing line.
[3023.02 → 3024.20] There are two cities.
[3024.78 → 3025.30] The kingdom
[3025.30 → 3026.62] of man
[3026.62 → 3027.30] where we seek
[3027.30 → 3028.18] to glorify
[3028.18 → 3028.82] ourselves
[3028.82 → 3030.60] and the kingdom of God
[3030.60 → 3031.22] which seeks
[3031.22 → 3031.78] to glorify
[3031.78 → 3033.02] God.
[3034.02 → 3035.48] And Jesus came into the world
[3035.48 → 3035.88] and he said,
[3036.12 → 3036.40] repent
[3036.40 → 3037.52] for the kingdom
[3037.52 → 3038.66] of heaven
[3038.66 → 3039.46] is at hand.
[3040.20 → 3041.04] In other words,
[3041.42 → 3042.10] cross over
[3042.10 → 3043.44] from your own kingdom
[3043.44 → 3044.06] of self
[3044.06 → 3044.76] and living
[3044.76 → 3045.60] for your own glory
[3045.60 → 3047.18] and wave this white flag
[3047.18 → 3047.90] of surrender
[3047.90 → 3049.60] to the true king
[3049.60 → 3051.78] and live for his glory.
[3052.90 → 3053.86] And this is why
[3053.86 → 3054.70] in the early church
[3054.70 → 3055.44] simply claiming
[3055.44 → 3056.50] to be a Christian
[3056.50 → 3058.68] was a deep demonstration
[3058.68 → 3059.58] of loyalty
[3059.58 → 3060.42] to Jesus.
[3060.62 → 3061.62] Because if you say
[3061.62 → 3062.84] Jesus is Lord,
[3062.84 → 3064.32] that meant
[3064.32 → 3064.94] that Caesar
[3064.94 → 3066.22] is not.
[3067.08 → 3068.60] And no other power is.
[3069.40 → 3070.16] And that is why
[3070.16 → 3071.02] it was such a great
[3071.02 → 3071.92] source of persecution
[3071.92 → 3073.44] for the early church.
[3074.10 → 3075.28] And in the same way today,
[3075.72 → 3076.38] if you say
[3076.38 → 3077.60] Jesus is Lord,
[3078.64 → 3079.26] if you seek
[3079.26 → 3079.68] to have
[3079.68 → 3080.86] his word
[3080.86 → 3082.28] and his way
[3082.28 → 3083.06] shape the way
[3083.06 → 3083.56] you live
[3083.56 → 3084.36] and the way you talk
[3084.36 → 3084.90] and act
[3084.90 → 3085.60] and behave,
[3086.32 → 3087.02] that will put you
[3087.02 → 3087.66] in conflict
[3087.66 → 3088.98] with the world
[3088.98 → 3090.46] which is seeking
[3090.46 → 3090.94] the glory
[3090.94 → 3092.02] of itself.
[3092.84 → 3095.82] Christians are people
[3095.82 → 3097.10] who have had
[3097.10 → 3098.18] a glimpse
[3098.18 → 3099.08] of the kingdom
[3099.08 → 3099.54] of heaven.
[3100.38 → 3101.68] We know what it's like.
[3102.46 → 3103.56] Jesus has showed us
[3103.56 → 3104.20] and taught us.
[3104.52 → 3105.64] We've experienced it.
[3106.32 → 3106.56] Right?
[3106.60 → 3107.16] And we are people
[3107.16 → 3107.98] who are praying
[3107.98 → 3109.18] for God's kingdom
[3109.18 → 3110.16] to come on earth
[3110.16 → 3111.06] as it is in heaven.
[3111.68 → 3112.52] And we are people
[3112.52 → 3113.28] who want to walk
[3113.28 → 3113.88] in the ways
[3113.88 → 3114.50] of our master
[3114.50 → 3115.14] and our Lord
[3115.14 → 3116.18] and to model
[3116.18 → 3117.30] to the world around us
[3117.30 → 3118.14] what it looks like
[3118.14 → 3119.46] when the light of heaven
[3119.46 → 3119.96] is breaking
[3119.96 → 3121.02] into the darkness.
[3121.02 → 3121.22] darkness.
[3122.12 → 3122.74] And if we are
[3122.74 → 3123.76] really following Jesus,
[3124.20 → 3125.06] if we're walking
[3125.06 → 3126.24] in his footsteps,
[3126.96 → 3129.26] we will expose
[3129.26 → 3130.60] the darkness.
[3131.90 → 3132.46] And that's why
[3132.46 → 3133.26] the very next thing
[3133.26 → 3133.92] Jesus says
[3133.92 → 3134.80] in the Sermon on the Mount
[3134.80 → 3136.16] is that you are
[3136.16 → 3136.98] the light of the world.
[3137.60 → 3138.58] You are a city
[3138.58 → 3139.12] on a hill.
[3140.42 → 3141.62] But when we live
[3141.62 → 3142.38] as the light
[3142.38 → 3143.18] and confront
[3143.18 → 3143.72] the darkness,
[3144.02 → 3144.86] it results
[3144.86 → 3146.18] in persecution.
[3146.40 → 3146.86] Jesus says
[3146.86 → 3147.82] the world will hate you.
[3149.20 → 3150.34] William Wilbur I
[3150.34 → 3151.54] was a leader
[3151.54 → 3152.82] of the movement
[3152.82 → 3153.52] to abolish
[3153.52 → 3154.26] the slave trade
[3154.26 → 3156.20] and he was mocked
[3156.20 → 3157.38] and ridiculed
[3157.38 → 3158.16] and opposed
[3158.16 → 3159.16] his whole life.
[3160.18 → 3161.42] Martin Luther King Jr.,
[3161.42 → 3161.94] who laboured
[3161.94 → 3162.72] for the dignity
[3162.72 → 3164.00] of black people
[3164.00 → 3164.54] in America,
[3164.88 → 3165.74] was executed.
[3165.94 → 3166.54] He was shot
[3166.54 → 3167.28] in the face.
[3170.14 → 3171.84] So what is the cause
[3171.84 → 3172.40] of the kind
[3172.40 → 3173.14] of persecution
[3173.14 → 3174.20] that Jesus is speaking
[3174.20 → 3175.32] of in this text?
[3176.18 → 3176.66] Simply,
[3177.28 → 3178.16] it is supreme
[3178.16 → 3179.40] loyalty to Jesus.
[3179.40 → 3181.32] supreme loyalty
[3181.32 → 3181.96] to Jesus
[3181.96 → 3182.76] and his kingdom.
[3183.32 → 3184.16] And it's a loyalty
[3184.16 → 3185.30] that is expressed
[3185.30 → 3186.08] in our mouths
[3186.08 → 3187.40] and it is embodied
[3187.40 → 3188.78] in our actions.
[3189.84 → 3190.78] And this is especially
[3190.78 → 3191.34] true
[3191.34 → 3193.02] if you follow
[3193.02 → 3194.78] the whole Jesus
[3194.78 → 3196.10] and not just
[3196.10 → 3196.66] part of him.
[3197.58 → 3198.36] If you follow
[3198.36 → 3199.44] the whole Jesus,
[3199.92 → 3200.72] people are going
[3200.72 → 3201.38] to reject
[3201.38 → 3202.54] part of you.
[3203.60 → 3204.50] The part
[3204.50 → 3206.60] that is out of step
[3206.60 → 3208.24] with the surrounding
[3208.24 → 3208.66] culture.
[3210.28 → 3211.82] And like Jesus said,
[3212.20 → 3212.80] they will say
[3212.80 → 3213.96] all kinds of evil
[3213.96 → 3214.64] against you.
[3215.06 → 3215.30] You know,
[3215.34 → 3216.18] in any part
[3216.18 → 3216.72] of the world
[3216.72 → 3218.10] where the gospel
[3218.10 → 3219.80] comes to a culture,
[3219.94 → 3220.90] it is going to be,
[3221.24 → 3221.84] it will affirm
[3221.84 → 3222.56] some good things
[3222.56 → 3223.16] about the culture
[3223.16 → 3224.84] and it will critique
[3224.84 → 3225.86] some other things.
[3226.10 → 3226.86] And that looks different
[3226.86 → 3227.64] in every culture.
[3228.24 → 3229.06] And so we need wisdom
[3229.06 → 3230.44] to know
[3230.44 → 3231.04] how do we live
[3231.04 → 3231.68] as a Christian?
[3231.68 → 3233.64] and the things
[3233.64 → 3234.10] that the culture
[3234.10 → 3234.62] celebrates
[3234.62 → 3236.40] sometimes is opposed
[3236.40 → 3238.32] to God's kingdom.
[3239.16 → 3239.60] And we need
[3239.60 → 3240.42] to follow Jesus
[3240.42 → 3241.30] even when that is
[3241.30 → 3241.92] the most challenging
[3241.92 → 3242.88] place to do so.
[3249.02 → 3250.78] And so if these verses,
[3252.04 → 3252.96] this verse,
[3253.28 → 3253.44] you know,
[3254.02 → 3254.78] blessed are you
[3254.78 → 3255.66] if you are persecuted,
[3256.16 → 3256.98] if that
[3256.98 → 3258.96] is a completely
[3258.96 → 3260.44] foreign experience
[3260.44 → 3261.24] to us,
[3261.68 → 3262.20] I mean,
[3262.26 → 3262.46] you know,
[3262.50 → 3263.26] we don't live
[3263.26 → 3264.12] in countries
[3264.12 → 3264.86] where we're going
[3264.86 → 3265.28] to be,
[3265.28 → 3265.60] you know,
[3265.66 → 3266.68] thrown right in jail.
[3267.62 → 3268.70] But if this has
[3268.70 → 3269.50] nothing to do
[3269.50 → 3270.44] with our Christian lives,
[3271.12 → 3272.42] if we never feel
[3272.42 → 3273.66] like we don't
[3273.66 → 3274.82] quite belong
[3274.82 → 3276.02] to the culture
[3276.02 → 3276.66] we live in,
[3276.78 → 3277.68] we have to ask
[3277.68 → 3278.22] the question,
[3278.66 → 3279.86] who am I really
[3279.86 → 3280.28] following?
[3281.50 → 3282.72] Is it the whole
[3282.72 → 3283.24] Jesus?
[3284.42 → 3285.32] Or is it the
[3285.32 → 3286.60] culturally acceptable
[3286.60 → 3288.58] parts of Jesus?
[3289.60 → 3289.72] Right?
[3289.84 → 3290.12] Is it,
[3290.12 → 3290.84] are we following
[3290.84 → 3291.68] the whole Jesus
[3291.68 → 3292.50] or are we
[3292.50 → 3294.08] following part
[3294.08 → 3295.00] of our love
[3295.00 → 3295.54] of comfort?
[3296.80 → 3297.58] Are we following
[3297.58 → 3298.22] the whole Jesus
[3298.22 → 3298.98] or are we
[3298.98 → 3300.52] following part
[3300.52 → 3301.20] of, you know,
[3301.24 → 3302.26] what we fear
[3302.26 → 3303.10] people might
[3303.10 → 3306.06] say about us?
[3307.34 → 3308.68] So here's the question
[3308.68 → 3310.76] for every one of us.
[3311.80 → 3312.32] It's,
[3312.78 → 3313.24] will you,
[3313.40 → 3314.24] will I,
[3314.86 → 3317.18] give our reputation
[3317.18 → 3318.42] persecution
[3318.42 → 3318.98] to Jesus?
[3320.76 → 3321.72] Will you give
[3321.72 → 3323.08] your social standing
[3323.08 → 3324.10] to Jesus?
[3324.30 → 3324.84] Will you look
[3324.84 → 3325.44] ridiculous
[3325.44 → 3326.82] in the sight
[3326.82 → 3327.48] of the world
[3327.48 → 3328.80] for Jesus?
[3329.06 → 3329.84] Will you surrender
[3329.84 → 3330.58] to him
[3330.58 → 3332.08] what other people
[3332.08 → 3332.86] say for the sake
[3332.86 → 3334.24] of what he says?
[3336.42 → 3337.96] So Jesus is talking
[3337.96 → 3339.04] about a specific
[3339.04 → 3339.96] kind of persecution
[3339.96 → 3340.70] in this passage
[3340.70 → 3341.78] for righteousness
[3341.78 → 3342.30] sake,
[3342.48 → 3343.38] because of me.
[3343.38 → 3345.36] If you receive
[3345.36 → 3345.94] opposition,
[3346.42 → 3346.94] if you receive
[3346.94 → 3347.70] hostility
[3347.70 → 3348.90] and mistreatment
[3348.90 → 3349.56] and rejection,
[3350.64 → 3351.62] and you experience
[3351.62 → 3352.28] it because you
[3352.28 → 3352.94] follow me,
[3353.00 → 3353.64] Jesus says,
[3354.50 → 3356.22] you are blessed.
[3356.82 → 3357.32] Jesus says,
[3357.42 → 3358.26] blessed are you.
[3358.66 → 3359.18] Congratulations,
[3359.64 → 3361.66] you are in sync
[3361.66 → 3361.98] with me,
[3362.02 → 3362.60] you are aligned
[3362.60 → 3363.24] with my kingdom,
[3363.34 → 3364.26] you are in harmony
[3364.26 → 3365.56] with the way
[3365.56 → 3366.26] of this kingdom
[3366.26 → 3366.74] of heaven.
[3367.74 → 3368.42] And lastly,
[3368.84 → 3369.74] Jesus talks about
[3369.74 → 3370.72] the response
[3370.72 → 3371.40] to persecution.
[3371.40 → 3372.50] And we see this
[3372.50 → 3373.16] in verse 12.
[3374.30 → 3374.58] Friends,
[3374.66 → 3375.34] this is how we
[3375.34 → 3376.00] can endure
[3376.00 → 3377.22] persecution.
[3377.50 → 3378.16] This is how we
[3378.16 → 3379.50] can freely
[3379.50 → 3380.14] give up our
[3380.14 → 3380.74] reputations
[3380.74 → 3381.34] for the sake
[3381.34 → 3381.84] of Christ.
[3383.22 → 3383.90] Jesus says this,
[3383.98 → 3385.16] rejoice and be glad
[3385.16 → 3387.50] because great
[3387.50 → 3388.76] is your reward
[3388.76 → 3389.20] in heaven.
[3389.82 → 3390.48] For in the same
[3390.48 → 3391.42] way they persecuted
[3391.42 → 3391.98] the prophets
[3391.98 → 3393.56] who were before you.
[3394.62 → 3394.86] You know,
[3394.88 → 3395.72] in the book of Acts,
[3396.08 → 3396.50] the apostles
[3396.50 → 3397.32] John and Peter,
[3397.44 → 3398.24] they were imprisoned,
[3398.24 → 3399.32] they were beaten,
[3399.84 → 3400.68] and they returned
[3400.68 → 3401.46] to the group
[3401.46 → 3402.20] of other disciples
[3402.20 → 3403.32] after they were released,
[3403.74 → 3405.08] rejoicing that they
[3405.08 → 3406.26] were counted worthy
[3406.26 → 3408.70] to suffer for Christ.
[3410.78 → 3411.78] Here's what the
[3411.78 → 3412.76] German theologian
[3412.76 → 3413.40] and martyr,
[3413.60 → 3414.52] Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
[3414.60 → 3414.94] says.
[3416.16 → 3416.46] He says,
[3416.60 → 3418.60] suffering is the badge
[3418.60 → 3420.20] of true discipleship.
[3421.00 → 3422.02] Discipleship means
[3422.02 → 3423.00] allegiance to the
[3423.00 → 3423.88] suffering from Christ.
[3424.36 → 3425.14] And it is therefore
[3425.14 → 3426.14] not at all surprising
[3426.14 → 3426.88] that Christians
[3426.88 → 3427.86] should be called upon
[3427.86 → 3428.32] to suffer.
[3428.32 → 3429.10] In fact,
[3429.14 → 3430.02] it is a joy
[3430.02 → 3431.52] and a token
[3431.52 → 3433.10] of his grace.
[3434.64 → 3435.38] And so when you
[3435.38 → 3436.46] encounter persecution,
[3437.02 → 3438.16] rejoice and be glad.
[3438.90 → 3439.80] And Jesus says,
[3440.10 → 3441.06] I want you to keep
[3441.06 → 3442.40] two things in mind.
[3443.26 → 3443.56] He says,
[3443.64 → 3444.22] number one,
[3444.60 → 3445.30] you can rejoice
[3445.30 → 3445.82] and be glad
[3445.82 → 3446.66] because great
[3446.66 → 3447.48] is your reward
[3447.48 → 3447.92] in heaven.
[3448.82 → 3448.96] Right?
[3449.02 → 3449.70] So you're not
[3449.70 → 3450.54] going to necessarily
[3450.54 → 3451.52] be invited
[3451.52 → 3452.44] to that cool
[3452.44 → 3453.42] cocktail party
[3453.42 → 3453.84] downtown.
[3454.72 → 3455.54] But you will
[3455.54 → 3456.08] be invited
[3456.08 → 3457.12] to that great
[3457.12 → 3457.96] marriage supper
[3457.96 → 3458.70] of the Lamb
[3458.70 → 3460.10] and you will
[3460.10 → 3461.26] be an honoured guest.
[3462.36 → 3462.66] And friends,
[3462.72 → 3463.46] that is a great
[3463.46 → 3463.96] reward.
[3464.64 → 3464.72] Right?
[3464.82 → 3465.80] And that just
[3465.80 → 3466.56] cheers us up.
[3467.18 → 3467.62] We're going to be
[3467.62 → 3468.54] rewarded in heaven.
[3470.06 → 3470.74] Living for Jesus
[3470.74 → 3471.50] is not safe.
[3471.76 → 3472.70] It is not comfortable.
[3473.22 → 3474.22] But it is very
[3474.22 → 3474.70] rewarding.
[3476.10 → 3476.54] Jesus says,
[3476.62 → 3477.18] remember that.
[3477.80 → 3478.62] And then number two,
[3478.92 → 3479.32] he says,
[3479.46 → 3480.10] remember this,
[3480.38 → 3481.46] you are in good
[3481.46 → 3482.08] company.
[3483.22 → 3483.76] Jesus says,
[3483.82 → 3484.44] for the same way
[3484.44 → 3485.24] they persecuted
[3485.24 → 3485.82] the prophets
[3485.82 → 3486.44] who were before
[3486.44 → 3486.74] you.
[3487.42 → 3487.66] Right?
[3487.70 → 3488.20] When the world
[3488.20 → 3488.76] treats you
[3488.76 → 3489.56] as a nobody,
[3489.86 → 3491.04] as despised
[3491.04 → 3491.70] because you
[3491.70 → 3492.34] follow Jesus,
[3493.02 → 3494.18] you get assigned
[3494.18 → 3494.88] a place with
[3494.88 → 3495.40] the prophets.
[3496.58 → 3496.80] Right?
[3496.84 → 3497.46] The moment that
[3497.46 → 3498.04] you get written
[3498.04 → 3498.52] off,
[3499.00 → 3499.80] cold-shouldered,
[3499.88 → 3500.34] is the very
[3500.34 → 3501.18] moment when you
[3501.18 → 3501.98] are inducted
[3501.98 → 3502.96] into heaven's
[3502.96 → 3503.92] hall of fame
[3503.92 → 3504.68] and you become
[3504.68 → 3505.78] part of an elite
[3505.78 → 3506.16] club.
[3507.22 → 3507.84] And when you
[3507.84 → 3508.76] face persecution,
[3509.34 → 3510.14] it's a great
[3510.14 → 3510.52] comfort,
[3510.66 → 3510.90] isn't it,
[3510.90 → 3511.36] to know that
[3511.36 → 3511.84] you are not
[3511.84 → 3512.16] alone,
[3512.16 → 3513.72] but that
[3513.72 → 3514.44] you stand
[3514.44 → 3515.08] with your
[3515.08 → 3515.62] brothers and
[3515.62 → 3516.40] sisters around
[3516.40 → 3516.80] the world
[3516.80 → 3517.44] throughout the
[3517.44 → 3517.94] ages who
[3517.94 → 3518.68] have also
[3518.68 → 3519.94] stood fast
[3519.94 → 3520.58] in their
[3520.58 → 3521.02] faith.
[3521.60 → 3522.00] And that's
[3522.00 → 3522.32] a great
[3522.32 → 3522.70] comfort.
[3523.82 → 3524.40] And we
[3524.40 → 3524.76] wouldn't want
[3524.76 → 3525.10] to be in
[3525.10 → 3525.48] any other
[3525.48 → 3525.84] company.
[3526.86 → 3527.54] And ultimately,
[3527.70 → 3528.08] here's the
[3528.08 → 3528.58] reason that we
[3528.58 → 3529.10] can rejoice
[3529.10 → 3529.64] and be glad.
[3529.88 → 3530.30] It's not
[3530.30 → 3530.96] because that
[3530.96 → 3531.34] we are
[3531.34 → 3532.10] suffering for
[3532.10 → 3532.48] Jesus.
[3533.18 → 3533.72] It's not
[3533.72 → 3534.12] like we're
[3534.12 → 3534.52] trying to
[3534.52 → 3535.34] prove ourselves
[3535.34 → 3536.12] to him
[3536.12 → 3536.82] by being
[3536.82 → 3537.36] persecuted.
[3538.46 → 3539.16] We don't
[3539.16 → 3540.16] suffer for
[3540.16 → 3540.90] him to
[3540.90 → 3542.02] earn his
[3542.02 → 3542.44] acceptance.
[3543.36 → 3543.84] Rather,
[3544.02 → 3544.30] we are
[3544.30 → 3545.18] suffering with
[3545.18 → 3545.68] Jesus,
[3546.44 → 3547.32] the one who
[3547.32 → 3548.18] suffered for
[3548.18 → 3549.40] us to
[3549.40 → 3549.98] make us
[3549.98 → 3550.64] his children.
[3551.40 → 3551.96] That's why
[3551.96 → 3553.56] we can rejoice
[3553.56 → 3554.40] and be glad.
[3554.82 → 3555.78] Because we
[3555.78 → 3556.78] serve a
[3556.78 → 3556.98] king,
[3557.04 → 3557.80] we follow a
[3557.80 → 3558.88] king who
[3558.88 → 3560.00] loves us
[3560.00 → 3561.02] and who
[3561.02 → 3562.10] suffered for
[3562.10 → 3562.80] us.
[3563.54 → 3563.88] And he
[3563.88 → 3564.42] suffers with
[3564.42 → 3564.76] us.
[3565.94 → 3566.72] That's why
[3566.72 → 3567.12] in the book
[3567.12 → 3567.62] of Hebrews,
[3567.82 → 3568.20] which was
[3568.20 → 3568.74] written to
[3568.74 → 3569.26] persecuted
[3569.26 → 3570.86] Christians in
[3570.86 → 3571.18] the Roman
[3571.18 → 3571.66] Empire,
[3571.66 → 3572.20] it says
[3572.20 → 3572.60] this,
[3573.54 → 3574.24] let us
[3574.24 → 3575.20] run with
[3575.20 → 3575.84] perseverance
[3575.84 → 3576.52] the race
[3576.52 → 3576.94] marked out
[3576.94 → 3577.48] for us,
[3578.34 → 3578.94] fixing our
[3578.94 → 3580.32] eyes on
[3580.32 → 3580.68] Jesus,
[3580.80 → 3581.58] the pioneer
[3581.58 → 3582.30] and perfecter
[3582.30 → 3582.64] of our
[3582.64 → 3583.00] faith,
[3583.80 → 3584.06] who for
[3584.06 → 3584.56] the joy
[3584.56 → 3585.26] set before
[3585.26 → 3586.66] him endured
[3586.66 → 3588.18] the cross,
[3588.30 → 3588.94] the ultimate
[3588.94 → 3589.82] persecution,
[3590.96 → 3591.80] scorning its
[3591.80 → 3592.18] shame,
[3593.56 → 3594.26] scorning its
[3594.26 → 3594.66] shame.
[3597.00 → 3597.72] He sat
[3597.72 → 3598.66] down at the
[3598.66 → 3599.54] right hand of
[3599.54 → 3600.04] the throne of
[3600.04 → 3600.36] God.
[3602.44 → 3602.86] Friends,
[3602.94 → 3603.68] we rejoice
[3603.68 → 3604.74] because Jesus
[3604.74 → 3605.68] suffered for
[3605.68 → 3606.22] us.
[3606.90 → 3607.74] He set us
[3607.74 → 3608.72] free from
[3608.72 → 3609.52] sin and
[3609.52 → 3609.82] death.
[3610.22 → 3610.76] The victory
[3610.76 → 3611.34] is won.
[3612.38 → 3612.90] Jesus is
[3612.90 → 3613.58] reigning on
[3613.58 → 3614.22] his throne.
[3615.22 → 3615.98] And one
[3615.98 → 3617.16] day, the
[3617.16 → 3617.64] kingdom of
[3617.64 → 3618.14] God will
[3618.14 → 3618.66] come in
[3618.66 → 3619.32] all of its
[3619.32 → 3619.58] fullness.
[3620.30 → 3620.58] And friends,
[3620.66 → 3621.12] that is our
[3621.12 → 3621.34] hope.
[3621.44 → 3621.78] That has been
[3621.78 → 3622.38] the hope of
[3622.38 → 3622.86] Christians
[3622.86 → 3624.14] throughout the
[3624.14 → 3624.44] ages.
[3624.44 → 3624.60] Jesus.
[3625.30 → 3625.78] So I
[3625.78 → 3626.00] want to
[3626.00 → 3626.58] leave us
[3626.58 → 3627.22] with an
[3627.22 → 3627.78] old hymn
[3627.78 → 3628.36] written by
[3628.36 → 3629.10] Isaac Watts.
[3630.10 → 3630.82] I've never
[3630.82 → 3631.30] heard of this
[3631.30 → 3631.90] hymn before.
[3632.74 → 3633.14] Maybe it's not
[3633.14 → 3633.56] very good,
[3633.60 → 3633.98] I don't know,
[3634.06 → 3634.72] but I like the
[3634.72 → 3635.42] words at least.
[3635.82 → 3636.40] So here's what
[3636.40 → 3636.84] he says.
[3636.98 → 3637.34] Just let's
[3637.34 → 3637.90] meditate on
[3637.90 → 3638.16] this.
[3640.06 → 3641.08] The first
[3641.08 → 3641.96] verse says
[3641.96 → 3642.28] this,
[3642.28 → 3643.66] Am I a
[3643.66 → 3644.18] soldier of
[3644.18 → 3644.74] the cross,
[3645.46 → 3646.20] a follower
[3646.20 → 3647.00] of the
[3647.00 → 3647.26] lamb?
[3647.88 → 3648.72] And shall I
[3648.72 → 3649.78] fear to
[3649.78 → 3650.56] own his
[3650.56 → 3651.18] cause,
[3651.48 → 3652.76] or blush
[3652.76 → 3653.84] to speak
[3653.84 → 3654.58] his name?
[3655.44 → 3656.40] Must I be
[3656.40 → 3657.02] carried to
[3657.02 → 3657.68] the skies
[3657.68 → 3658.62] and flowery
[3658.62 → 3659.00] beds of
[3659.00 → 3659.38] ease,
[3659.88 → 3660.64] while others
[3660.64 → 3661.20] fought to
[3661.20 → 3661.52] win the
[3661.52 → 3662.10] prize,
[3662.74 → 3663.44] and sailed
[3663.44 → 3664.10] through
[3664.10 → 3664.44] bloody
[3664.44 → 3665.06] seas?
[3667.40 → 3668.40] Will you,
[3668.76 → 3669.42] will I,
[3669.66 → 3670.70] will we be
[3670.70 → 3671.30] willing to
[3671.30 → 3671.68] sail through
[3671.68 → 3671.94] whatever
[3671.94 → 3672.66] bloody seas
[3672.66 → 3673.16] the Lord
[3673.16 → 3674.18] might appoint
[3674.18 → 3674.84] for us?
[3675.76 → 3676.32] You don't
[3676.32 → 3676.60] know,
[3676.68 → 3676.94] we don't
[3676.94 → 3677.20] know in
[3677.20 → 3678.74] advance how
[3678.74 → 3679.08] that is
[3679.08 → 3679.36] going to
[3679.36 → 3679.82] play out,
[3680.60 → 3681.84] but Jesus
[3681.84 → 3682.86] says he
[3682.86 → 3683.26] will be
[3683.26 → 3683.76] with us.
[3684.48 → 3685.18] He promises
[3685.18 → 3685.78] at the end
[3685.78 → 3686.28] of Matthew's
[3686.28 → 3686.58] gospel,
[3686.86 → 3687.24] I will be
[3687.24 → 3687.66] with you
[3687.66 → 3688.20] always,
[3688.84 → 3689.74] even to
[3689.74 → 3690.24] the very
[3690.24 → 3690.74] end of
[3690.74 → 3691.22] the age.
[3692.42 → 3693.12] Let's pray
[3693.12 → 3693.42] together.
[3697.76 → 3698.32] Father,
[3699.04 → 3700.52] this too
[3700.52 → 3701.22] is your
[3701.22 → 3701.82] word of
[3701.82 → 3702.24] love to
[3702.24 → 3702.62] us.
[3703.74 → 3703.92] Lord,
[3704.04 → 3705.06] we thank
[3705.06 → 3705.30] you that
[3705.30 → 3705.46] you've
[3705.46 → 3705.82] told us
[3705.82 → 3706.22] ahead of
[3706.22 → 3706.70] time what
[3706.70 → 3707.16] it might
[3707.16 → 3707.74] mean to
[3707.74 → 3708.30] follow you,
[3708.90 → 3709.74] what you
[3709.74 → 3710.76] ask, and
[3710.76 → 3711.00] Lord, you
[3711.00 → 3711.72] don't ask
[3711.72 → 3712.92] that much.
[3714.68 → 3715.42] You ask
[3715.42 → 3716.16] for everything
[3716.16 → 3717.46] because you
[3717.46 → 3717.92] have given
[3717.92 → 3718.76] everything to
[3718.76 → 3719.18] us.
[3720.18 → 3720.82] Lord, we
[3720.82 → 3722.58] face here
[3722.58 → 3723.14] in Canada
[3723.14 → 3724.42] not a lot
[3724.42 → 3725.04] of persecution,
[3726.04 → 3726.88] but Lord, we
[3726.88 → 3727.34] do face
[3727.34 → 3727.90] sometimes the
[3727.90 → 3729.26] shame of
[3729.26 → 3729.60] being called
[3729.60 → 3729.90] by your
[3729.90 → 3730.18] name.
[3730.30 → 3730.78] We face
[3730.78 → 3732.12] cultural
[3732.12 → 3732.64] pressure,
[3733.04 → 3733.26] Lord, to
[3733.26 → 3734.82] conform to
[3734.82 → 3736.02] different values
[3736.02 → 3736.52] of the world
[3736.52 → 3736.96] that are not
[3736.96 → 3737.60] the values of
[3737.60 → 3738.06] your kingdom.
[3738.46 → 3738.70] And so,
[3738.80 → 3739.10] Lord, make
[3739.10 → 3739.64] us brave.
[3740.92 → 3741.60] Help us to
[3741.60 → 3742.36] scorn the
[3742.36 → 3743.48] shame of
[3743.48 → 3744.00] persecution
[3744.00 → 3745.64] because that
[3745.64 → 3746.02] is what you
[3746.02 → 3746.46] have done for
[3746.46 → 3747.08] us, and you
[3747.08 → 3747.56] call us to
[3747.56 → 3748.04] follow you.
[3748.64 → 3749.02] Lord, be
[3749.02 → 3750.40] with us in
[3750.40 → 3751.48] whatever form
[3751.48 → 3751.98] of persecution
[3751.98 → 3752.72] that we face
[3752.72 → 3753.32] in our lives,
[3753.80 → 3754.64] and Lord, would
[3754.64 → 3755.34] you help us to
[3755.34 → 3756.04] be your faithful
[3756.04 → 3756.48] followers.
[3756.48 → 3757.52] We pray for
[3757.52 → 3758.06] your help in
[3758.06 → 3758.66] Jesus' name.
[3759.10 → 3759.40] Amen.
[3761.42 → 3762.24] Let's stand
[3762.24 → 3763.38] and let's sing
[3763.38 → 3764.26] now our
[3764.26 → 3764.76] song of

[3980.16 → 3987.10] the Seemed Territory, which is the Southward Territory.
[3987.88 → 3992.10] And I reached out to Jane yesterday,
[3992.32 → 3995.20] and I asked her if she had any prayer requests and how things were going.
[3995.48 → 3998.42] So I'm going to read you just a few really quick sentences.
[3998.64 → 3999.42] I won't elaborate.
[3999.42 → 4001.74] But she says,
[4002.14 → 4006.78] Pray God would reach out to our friends who have been part of our fellowship
[4006.78 → 4012.20] but have chosen to continue, not to continue in our meetings.

[4062.32 → 4066.24] So these are just some of the things that give us a little bit of insight into their work there.
[4066.24 → 4073.30] So in addition to supporting them financially, it's always good to be reminded how we can support them prayerfully.

[4192.10 → 4195.66] Katrina, and a nasty fall this morning.
[4195.78 → 4197.96] She is in emergency, and she has some broken ribs,
[4198.34 → 4203.06] and so we are going to also pray for her this morning.
[4206.08 → 4208.54] I'm going to pray some things in sections,
[4208.74 → 4212.50] and so when I say, Lord, in your mercy, please respond with hear our prayer.
[4213.14 → 4214.30] Let's go to God in prayer.
[4216.20 → 4220.08] Lord of all creation, we have spoken and sung of your greatness,
[4220.08 → 4222.54] your forgiveness, your saving grace.
[4223.14 → 4226.66] You hear us when we call to you, whatever our needs.
[4227.22 → 4230.84] You know them before they leave our lips, and yet, as our Father,
[4231.40 → 4235.72] you want us to bring our longings to you, for you desire to draw us close.
[4236.40 → 4239.72] And so this morning, we lay our hearts bare before you.
[4240.66 → 4245.16] We pray for our hurting world, your creation that you love so deeply,
[4245.16 → 4251.04] but so marred by sin through broken relationships, violence, and apathy.
[4251.90 → 4254.24] Even the crust of the earth is fragile,
[4254.80 → 4257.96] as we've been reminded of in the devastating earthquake in Turkey.
[4258.68 → 4261.32] We pray for those who have lost loved ones,
[4261.70 → 4265.04] for those who are still trying desperately to rescue victims,
[4265.76 → 4269.40] recovery workers searching for those who have perished in the rubble,
[4269.40 → 4274.88] and organizations supporting those left with unimaginable trauma and grief.
[4275.76 → 4279.84] Lord, the magnitude of this event is something we can't even begin to comprehend.
[4280.78 → 4284.40] We can only fall on your grace as we lay this before you,
[4284.94 → 4287.14] for we know you are present there.
[4288.00 → 4291.18] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4292.24 → 4295.44] There are so many other areas where hope seems dim.
[4295.44 → 4302.44] We think of Ukraine, of Iran, of several African nations, all areas of conflict.
[4303.24 → 4305.98] Bring your light, we pray, through your body, the church.
[4306.60 → 4309.62] We remember those who are being persecuted for their faith,
[4309.72 → 4312.32] no matter where or how dangerous their plight.
[4313.08 → 4315.64] Give them courage and strength to hold fast.
[4316.44 → 4321.00] Grow your church even through their trials, as you have done so often in the past.
[4321.00 → 4327.64] May your kingdom and glory and the glory of your name be expanded wherever your church meets.
[4328.36 → 4331.22] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4332.36 → 4336.10] We pray for those who bring the gospel to far reaches of the world.
[4336.64 → 4338.20] Inspire them by your spirit.
[4338.88 → 4341.16] Give them words to speak when they feel inadequate,
[4342.04 → 4343.72] strength when they feel weak,
[4344.16 → 4346.10] and faith when they feel hopeless.
[4346.10 → 4350.04] Give them encouragement and joy in their work.
[4351.02 → 4354.86] We thank you for Howard, Annie, Tim, and Charity Johnson,
[4354.86 → 4358.82] as they minister to the Shoe swap Nation in Chase.
[4359.64 → 4361.80] Bring fruit to their labours, we pray.
[4362.88 → 4368.10] Thank you that we are able to minister alongside them through the gifts we bring.
[4368.10 → 4376.54] Will you stem the tide of First Nations suicides due to the opioid crisis?
[4377.32 → 4380.52] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4381.98 → 4385.60] We bring you the needs within our own faith community.
[4386.36 → 4391.54] We remember those who are struggling with physical health, cancer, and other illnesses.
[4392.68 → 4395.16] Lord, we know who some of them are,
[4395.16 → 4400.04] but we also know that there are those who suffer privately with physical, emotional,
[4400.72 → 4402.74] spiritual, or relational brokenness.
[4403.40 → 4406.02] We pray for all these brothers and sisters today,
[4406.34 → 4409.54] those mentioned every week, and those we are not aware of.
[4410.22 → 4414.46] Give hope and health to them and their loved ones who provide support and care.
[4415.64 → 4419.94] Restore us, Lord, for we all have wounds that need the touch of your healing hand.
[4419.94 → 4425.56] We pray for Katrine this morning, who's in emergency and has had a bad fall.
[4425.78 → 4430.66] Lord, will you walk beside her, and will you give her healing in her body?
[4431.78 → 4435.12] Give comfort to those who mourn the recent loss of loved ones.
[4435.22 → 4439.72] We think especially of Marianne and Henry and Harriet and Al and their families,
[4439.92 → 4442.72] each having lost a mother and a grandmother to their children.
[4443.74 → 4448.36] Will you also carry those who are remembering anniversaries of losing a dear family member?
[4448.36 → 4452.14] We look forward to the day when all will be made new,
[4452.44 → 4454.50] and we won't ever shed another tear.
[4455.34 → 4458.16] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4459.22 → 4461.32] Thank you for this fellowship of believers
[4461.32 → 4466.18] and for the inspiring stories shared in this semester's adult cross-training session.
[4466.74 → 4469.74] You are truly changing our lives as we hear these stories
[4469.74 → 4472.14] and consider what you have done for each of us.
[4472.72 → 4477.04] We thank you, too, for Pastor Jason, Pastor Nancy, and our council.
[4477.04 → 4480.78] Will you enrich their work and grow your kingdom here?
[4481.40 → 4487.58] We pray that you will provide people of your choice to lead us in the upcoming need for new council members.
[4488.20 → 4493.10] Give willingness to serve and joy to those who you choose to lead.
[4493.74 → 4496.58] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4496.58 → 4500.56] Go with us now that we may seek your kingdom first,
[4500.94 → 4505.40] that your fire may burn within us as we live our lives to seek justice,
[4505.98 → 4508.26] love mercy, and walk humbly with you.
