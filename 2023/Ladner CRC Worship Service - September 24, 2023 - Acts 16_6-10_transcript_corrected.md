[249.86 → 255.86] Good morning to you all.
[255.86 → 256.86] Good morning.
[256.86 → 259.86] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[259.86 → 266.86] And wherever you may be coming from this morning, we are glad that you are here joining us for worship.
[266.86 → 272.86] I just have a few announcements before we begin our time of worship.
[272.86 → 277.86] So the big one is that this Wednesday is our congregational meeting.
[277.86 → 280.86] So Wednesday at 7 p.m.
[280.86 → 281.86] Please do come.
[281.86 → 286.86] If you are a member, we, this is, we'll use the word duty.
[286.86 → 295.86] This is a duty for you to come unless you are providentially hindered.
[295.86 → 297.86] So please do come.
[297.86 → 300.86] And it's a privilege as well.
[300.86 → 304.86] If you are not a member, we still welcome you to join us.
[304.86 → 306.86] But you will not be able to vote.
[306.86 → 312.86] And with that in mind, if you would like to become a member, I am hoping to have a membership class sometime here in the fall.
[312.86 → 314.86] So please do keep an eye out for that.
[314.86 → 319.86] A couple of other things.
[319.86 → 322.86] Our fall cross-training session has begun.
[322.86 → 324.86] It began this morning at 9 a.m.
[324.86 → 330.86] And it is on creation care, climate change, and what the Bible has to say about that.
[330.86 → 332.86] I encourage you to come if you are able.
[332.86 → 335.86] Our men's breakfast is this Saturday.
[335.86 → 339.86] If you would like to come and have some good food, please talk to Bart.
[339.86 → 342.86] His email is in the bulletin here.
[342.86 → 347.86] And Thanksgiving is coming up, I think only in two weeks.
[347.86 → 353.86] And this year we want to do a food drive again for the Ladder Food Bank.
[353.86 → 359.86] And so please, like this is going to be kind of a more of a major emphasis than maybe last year.
[359.86 → 361.86] So bring some food.
[361.86 → 364.86] And when you come, bring it, keep it in your pew.
[364.86 → 367.86] And we're going to have the children kind of gather it and to bring it all up front.
[367.86 → 379.86] Another thing we want to do for Thanksgiving is, as the worship committee was talking, we would love to give everyone the opportunity on Thanksgiving Sunday to have an open mic.
[379.86 → 386.86] Where, you know, we'll pass it to you, but just to be able to stand and just kind of briefly share what you are grateful for.
[386.86 → 387.86] You know, what is, how has God blessed you?
[387.86 → 389.86] What are you grateful to God for?
[389.86 → 397.86] And I think it would be lovely too just to hear from each other, to hear these small testimonies of God's faithfulness in our lives.
[397.86 → 400.86] So I want to tell you now, so you can just be thinking about that.
[400.86 → 406.86] You know what would you like to encourage all of us with, with just what you're thankful for?
[406.86 → 409.86] Okay, so please give that some thought.
[409.86 → 416.86] With that, you know, we are here today to worship our God.
[416.86 → 418.86] He is our maker.
[418.86 → 420.86] He is our shepherd.
[420.86 → 423.86] He knows each of us by name.
[423.86 → 426.86] And he is inviting us to draw near to him.
[426.86 → 431.86] As he has drawn near to us in Jesus Christ.
[431.86 → 442.86] And as God calls us to worship him this morning, may we discover Jesus Christ to be both beautiful and believable in our hearts today.
[442.86 → 451.86] So with that in mind, please join me for our call to worship, which is found on the screen behind me in Psalm 95.
[451.86 → 454.86] Come, let us bow down in worship.
[454.86 → 457.86] Let us kneel before the Lord our maker.
[457.86 → 465.86] For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.
[465.86 → 469.86] Please pray with me as we come before God in a prayer of adoration.
[469.86 → 470.86] Let's pray.
[470.86 → 474.86] Our Heavenly Father, we praise you this morning.
[474.86 → 482.86] Your greatness, your glory, your grandeur causes us to kneel our hearts before you in worship.
[482.86 → 489.86] But your intimacy and your kindness and your care for each one of us means that we can trust in you.
[489.86 → 494.86] And our hearts and our minds are just prone to wander.
[494.86 → 499.86] And so, Lord, would you draw near to us this morning?
[499.86 → 507.86] Would you help to clear away anything preventing us from seeing Jesus as our strong and our loving shepherd?
[507.86 → 514.86] For as the psalmist reminds us, one day in your court is better than a thousand elsewhere.
[514.86 → 517.86] So, Lord, we long to be in your presence this morning.
[517.86 → 528.86] And, God, we delight to come before you and we come to you the only way we possibly can through the finished work of your Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[528.86 → 532.86] In his name we pray. Amen.
[532.86 → 537.86] Brothers and sisters, please stand for God's greeting to us this morning.
[537.86 → 540.86] Trust in the Lord with all of your heart.
[540.86 → 543.86] And lean not on your own understanding.
[543.86 → 546.86] In all of your ways submit to him.
[546.86 → 549.86] And he will make your paths straight.
[549.86 → 554.86] So, as God has called us and he's greeted us, let's turn and let's greet those around us.
[554.86 → 564.86] We'll texture this morning omni potentiometer.
[565.86 → 567.86] So, we'll give it to you those response to us.
[568.86 → 570.86] We'll deal out of your hearts.
[570.86 → 575.36] We'll see your hands, and move on the way we need us estado.
[575.86 → 576.86] Thank you.
[576.86 → 577.86] Please stand for us.
[577.86 → 578.86] Please stand we're blessed.
[578.86 → 579.86] We'll demand us a bigобраз.
[579.86 → 580.96] We'll generate to you summer our hearts.
[580.96 → 581.86] We'll Belfast our hearts.
[581.86 → 582.86] Build your hearts as we'll do so.
[582.86 → 584.86] Amen.
[612.86 → 614.86] Amen.
[642.86 → 644.86] Amen.
[672.86 → 674.86] Amen.
[702.86 → 704.86] Amen.
[732.86 → 734.86] Amen.
[762.86 → 764.86] Amen.
[792.86 → 794.86] Amen.
[822.86 → 824.86] Amen.
[852.86 → 854.86] Amen.
[882.86 → 884.86] Amen.
[912.86 → 914.86] Amen.
[942.86 → 944.86] Amen.
[972.86 → 974.86] Amen.
[1002.86 → 1004.86] Amen.
[1032.86 → 1033.90] Amen.
[1033.90 → 1036.32] Sing like never before.
[1036.46 → 1039.98] Oh my soul.
[1040.18 → 1045.66] I'll worship Your Holy Name.
[1046.72 → 1054.78] The sun comes, It's a new day dawned.
[1054.78 → 1059.32] It's time to sing your song again.
[1059.32 → 1066.24] Whatever day it comes and whatever lies before me.
[1067.20 → 1072.70] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[1075.84 → 1081.64] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul.
[1081.64 → 1086.20] Worship His holy name.
[1086.20 → 1092.38] Sing I never before, O my soul.
[1092.76 → 1097.16] I'll worship Your holy name.
[1100.66 → 1106.50] You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger.
[1106.50 → 1112.16] Your name is great, and your heart is kind.
[1112.64 → 1118.18] For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[1119.96 → 1125.06] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[1129.06 → 1134.66] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul.
[1134.66 → 1139.68] Worship His holy name.
[1140.12 → 1145.50] Sing I never before, O my soul.
[1145.84 → 1149.66] I worship Your holy name.
[1149.66 → 1159.80] And on that day when my strength is failing.
[1159.80 → 1165.06] The end was near, and my time has come.
[1165.76 → 1169.26] Still my soul will sing Your praise.
[1169.26 → 1171.26] And on that day when my strength is failing.
[1171.26 → 1172.26] I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure.
[1172.26 → 1174.26] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[1174.26 → 1179.26] Ten thousand reasons and forevermore.
[1179.26 → 1186.26] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul.
[1186.26 → 1191.26] Worship His holy name.
[1191.26 → 1196.26] Sing like never before, O my soul.
[1196.26 → 1201.26] I'll worship Your holy name.
[1201.26 → 1204.26] Worship Your holy name.
[1204.26 → 1208.26] Worship Your holy name.
[1208.26 → 1214.26] Worship Your holy name.
[1214.26 → 1216.26] You may be seated.
[1216.26 → 1219.20] You may be seated.
[1219.20 → 1220.44] Thank you.
[1220.44 → 1223.30] Thank you.
[1223.30 → 1226.30] Thank you.
[1226.30 → 1233.88] So today as we come before the Lord in a time of confession and assurance,
[1233.88 → 1238.92] I want to actually begin with this call to repentance from the prophet Isaiah.
[1239.52 → 1242.08] So hear what the prophet says.
[1242.08 → 1270.26] You see, what Isaiah is inviting us to be really to align our hearts with God's.
[1270.26 → 1283.38] And one of the ways we can understand this is in the words of the great theologian and pastor, St. Augustine, he said that sin is simply the dislocation of the soul.
[1284.56 → 1287.04] Sin is the dislocation of the soul.
[1287.30 → 1294.92] I don't know how many of you have ever dislocated a shoulder or maybe had a joint just kind of pop out.
[1294.92 → 1301.54] Now, if so, you know it's not only painful, but you can't function.
[1302.54 → 1306.24] It doesn't function the way it was intended, and so you need realignment.
[1307.50 → 1309.32] And confession is like that.
[1310.32 → 1320.60] Confession is simply God's way to remind us and to show us how we need to realign our lives and our souls and our hearts back to God
[1320.60 → 1329.16] so that we can function and so that we can live our lives ultimately in accord with who God is and what he commands us.
[1329.16 → 1336.28] And so, would you pray with me, and I will lead us in a short prayer of confession.
[1336.88 → 1338.40] Let's join our hearts in prayer.
[1338.40 → 1353.82] Most holy and gracious Father, we acknowledge and confess before you that our sinful natures are prone to do evil, and they are slow to do good.
[1354.96 → 1362.48] You alone know how often we have sinned in wandering from your ways and in forgetting your love.
[1362.48 → 1367.36] Merciful Lord, teach us to align our hearts with yours.
[1368.32 → 1374.48] Restore us from our wandering ways and forgive our sins through Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
[1375.36 → 1386.48] Lord, grant us the power that we might live in your light and walk in your ways according to your word, the commandments of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1387.08 → 1388.98] We pray this in his holy name.
[1389.54 → 1389.88] Amen.
[1389.88 → 1395.44] So, friends, to those who have confessed their sins, God is merciful.
[1396.24 → 1397.16] God is just.
[1397.82 → 1406.58] And although we have so often strayed from following his ways, our merciful God will not remove his steadfast love from us.
[1407.48 → 1410.12] So hear these words of grace from Ezekiel 36.
[1411.74 → 1412.80] God says this,
[1412.80 → 1416.58] I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you.
[1416.58 → 1421.46] I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[1422.00 → 1428.48] And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
[1428.78 → 1433.38] Then you will be my people, and I will be your God.
[1434.26 → 1434.78] Amen.
[1434.78 → 1444.40] If you are able, would you please rise and let's respond with this song assuring us of God's goodness and of his faithfulness to us in Christ.
[1444.40 → 1464.24] Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect plea.
[1464.24 → 1468.98] The great high priest who's made his love.
[1468.98 → 1473.98] Whoever lives and pleads for him.
[1473.98 → 1478.26] His name is waving on his hand.
[1478.52 → 1482.64] My name is written on his hand.
[1482.64 → 1483.38] I know the Lord.
[1483.38 → 1487.38] I know the world in heaven he stands.
[1487.38 → 1491.38] The tongue can hit me then see God.
[1491.38 → 1496.38] The tongue can hit me then see God.
[1496.38 → 1503.30] When Satan tempts me to despair.
[1503.30 → 1507.74] He tells me of the guilt with me.
[1508.12 → 1512.30] The word I look and see him there.
[1512.64 → 1517.02] Who made an end to all my sin.
[1517.34 → 1521.66] Because the sinless, they could die.
[1521.94 → 1526.06] My sinful soul is counted free.
[1526.06 → 1530.74] Or not the justice satisfied.
[1531.10 → 1535.10] To look on him and pardon me.
[1535.36 → 1540.12] To look on him and pardon me.
[1540.12 → 1541.12] Behold him and pardon me.
[1541.12 → 1547.18] Behold him there, the risen man.
[1547.18 → 1551.22] My perfect, oneless righteousness.
[1551.22 → 1556.46] The great unchangeable I am.
[1556.46 → 1561.42] The king of glory and of grace.
[1561.42 → 1566.42] But with himself I cannot die.
[1566.42 → 1570.84] My soul is gorgeous with his love.
[1570.84 → 1575.72] My love is in him, Christ on God.
[1575.72 → 1580.72] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1580.72 → 1585.14] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1585.14 → 1592.50] I bowed before the cross of Christ.
[1592.50 → 1597.18] And marvel at gifts of divine.
[1597.18 → 1601.80] God's perfect son was sacrificed.
[1602.14 → 1606.60] He made me righteous in God's eyes.
[1606.60 → 1611.20] This river's lips I cannot hold.
[1611.20 → 1615.86] But I have glory in his fall.
[1615.86 → 1620.50] The Lord will start as God's hope.
[1620.50 → 1625.30] And pardon me his glorious love.
[1625.30 → 1630.30] And pardon me his glorious love.
[1630.30 → 1632.66] Amen.
[1641.06 → 1643.82] I didn't recognize that last verse, but that's really, that's great.
[1644.74 → 1649.56] So the children at this time are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1649.56 → 1663.24] So I have been fighting off a cold this week.
[1663.24 → 1671.62] So I apologize if I'm a bit nasally, sniffly, and maybe not as exuberant.
[1671.62 → 1676.94] I still feel deeply about God's word, but it may not come through today.
[1677.34 → 1678.56] So we're just going to kind of go slow.
[1679.56 → 1683.02] So today we will be continuing our study in the book of Acts.
[1683.02 → 1688.10] So please turn in your Bibles with me to Acts chapter 16.
[1688.10 → 1693.38] It's on page 824 in your pew Bible, Acts chapter 16.
[1693.38 → 1704.38] Now at the end of chapter 15, we saw this ministry team of Paul and Barnabas getting ready to launch out on their second missionary journey together.
[1704.38 → 1715.96] But surprisingly, they couldn't figure out what God's will was regarding whether they should take John Mark with them.
[1716.96 → 1717.12] Right?
[1717.20 → 1718.78] Paul had his perspective.
[1719.50 → 1724.20] And yet looking at the exact same information, Barnabas came to a different conclusion.
[1724.20 → 1731.54] Last week, we saw Paul make the decision to circumcise Timothy.
[1731.54 → 1736.94] Will it help the cause of the gospel to have Timothy circumcised?
[1737.68 → 1738.96] Or will it hinder it?
[1739.74 → 1740.88] Was it the right decision?
[1742.18 → 1746.04] You know, apparently it's not always easy to know the right thing to do.
[1746.12 → 1748.94] It's not always easy to know the mind of God.
[1748.94 → 1754.02] But, you know, if you've been a Christian for very long, that's not news to you.
[1754.22 → 1754.38] Right?
[1754.46 → 1755.80] We all recognize that.
[1756.86 → 1766.36] Now in our passage this morning, we see yet another example of godly Christians struggling to know the will of God.
[1767.58 → 1772.54] So please follow along with me as I read Acts 16.
[1772.54 → 1774.12] We'll read verses 6 to 10.
[1774.46 → 1775.34] It's a short passage.
[1776.14 → 1778.02] Okay, so beginning in verse 6.
[1778.94 → 1786.82] Paul and his companions travelled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia,
[1787.40 → 1791.62] having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.
[1792.38 → 1796.94] When they came to the border of Mycenae, they tried to enter Bithynia,
[1797.54 → 1800.14] but the spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
[1800.76 → 1803.96] So they passed by Bithynia and went down to tRNAs.
[1804.78 → 1808.38] During the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia,
[1808.94 → 1810.68] standing and begging him,
[1811.16 → 1814.22] come over to Macedonia and help us.
[1815.08 → 1817.10] After Paul had seen the vision,
[1817.40 → 1820.94] we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia,
[1821.46 → 1826.68] concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
[1826.68 → 1830.00] This is the word of the Lord.
[1830.82 → 1831.78] Thanks be to God.
[1831.94 → 1832.38] Let's pray.
[1834.02 → 1841.50] Heavenly Father, we thank you that your word is a lamp for our feet and a light on our path.
[1842.48 → 1848.28] And so, Lord, we ask that your spirit would guide us this morning in the preaching of your word,
[1848.28 → 1853.50] that we may hear and believe what you have to say to us.
[1853.50 → 1855.24] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[1855.92 → 1856.28] Amen.
[1857.52 → 1860.78] You know, life is full of decisions, isn't it?
[1861.34 → 1862.52] Life is full of decisions.
[1862.52 → 1866.42] Some decisions, you know, we make all the time,
[1866.48 → 1868.52] and they're relatively small and minor.
[1868.94 → 1870.40] It doesn't really matter what we choose.
[1870.58 → 1872.78] So, you know, during the school week,
[1872.94 → 1874.50] I get up with my kids,
[1874.60 → 1879.78] and I help my younger kids decide what to pack for lunch.
[1879.78 → 1882.64] And the choices usually are,
[1882.92 → 1885.54] do they take leftovers or do they make a sandwich?
[1886.28 → 1888.48] If there are leftovers, then there's not really a choice.
[1890.42 → 1893.52] But it's not like we pause, and we pray about it.
[1893.90 → 1894.12] Right?
[1894.16 → 1896.50] We don't say, Lord, this is an important decision.
[1896.82 → 1898.42] We need you to guide us.
[1898.90 → 1899.10] Right?
[1899.10 → 1899.76] We don't do that.
[1899.92 → 1900.96] Just pack something for lunch.
[1901.00 → 1901.66] It's not a big deal.
[1903.12 → 1905.94] You know, but other decisions in life are like, you know,
[1906.00 → 1907.70] major forks in the road.
[1907.70 → 1910.54] They are monumental decisions.
[1912.36 → 1914.18] Where should I go to university?
[1915.34 → 1917.46] Or should I go to a trade school instead?
[1918.64 → 1920.48] What subject should I study?
[1922.00 → 1923.38] Where should I live?
[1924.02 → 1926.58] Should I leave home and test the waters elsewhere?
[1927.06 → 1928.24] Or should I stay here?
[1929.80 → 1930.98] Whom should I marry?
[1932.64 → 1934.76] Or should I marry?
[1935.20 → 1936.20] Should I remain single?
[1937.70 → 1938.78] Should we have kids?
[1939.58 → 1941.46] How many kids should we have and when?
[1942.68 → 1944.42] What kind of career should I have?
[1944.52 → 1947.22] Should I change my career at this point in my life?
[1948.62 → 1950.84] How much money should we spend on this item?
[1950.94 → 1951.76] Is it too much?
[1953.48 → 1955.54] How open should I be with my children
[1955.54 → 1959.60] or my spouse or a friend about a certain matter?
[1959.60 → 1963.14] When should I retire?
[1963.14 → 1966.02] What will I do with my time?
[1967.30 → 1967.66] Right?
[1967.70 → 1969.80] When it comes to these major decisions,
[1970.24 → 1974.72] we absolutely want God to guide us, don't we?
[1975.64 → 1976.94] And we find ourselves saying,
[1977.02 → 1978.60] God, what would you have me do?
[1978.60 → 1982.46] Well, in our passage today,
[1982.66 → 1984.08] Paul and his companions,
[1984.28 → 1985.60] they're going about ministry.
[1986.10 → 1988.70] They're seeking to be faithful to God.
[1989.10 → 1991.84] They're seeking to follow God's will
[1991.84 → 1993.98] for what he would have them do.
[1994.06 → 1995.24] They're on his mission.
[1995.24 → 1999.16] And we're going to see God interrupting
[1999.16 → 2002.90] and then guiding them to fulfill his plan.
[2004.42 → 2006.52] And so we're going to look at this passage
[2006.52 → 2010.26] and let's look in more detail about what's happening.
[2010.92 → 2012.16] And then we'll just consider
[2012.16 → 2014.52] how we can relate this to our own lives.
[2014.52 → 2017.60] And as we look at our passage this morning,
[2017.84 → 2020.56] I want us to keep this proverb in mind.
[2021.10 → 2024.16] Proverbs 16, verse 9.
[2025.66 → 2028.36] In their hearts, humans plan their course,
[2028.88 → 2031.16] but the Lord establishes their steps.
[2031.20 → 2031.98] Let's say it together.
[2032.98 → 2036.34] In their hearts, humans plan their course,
[2037.00 → 2040.02] but the Lord establishes their steps.
[2041.44 → 2044.30] So first, let's see what's happening here in our text.
[2045.46 → 2048.36] And what we see is Paul and his companions,
[2048.68 → 2050.14] they're out, they're doing ministry.
[2050.38 → 2052.76] They're seeking to be faithful to their calling.
[2054.02 → 2056.48] And notice, they're not just kind of waiting around
[2056.48 → 2057.90] and twiddling their thumbs,
[2058.50 → 2061.26] waiting for God to tell them exactly what to do.
[2061.82 → 2063.80] No, they are proactive.
[2064.04 → 2065.34] They are on mission.
[2066.30 → 2067.74] And so starting in verse 6,
[2067.74 → 2069.46] we see Paul and Silas,
[2069.86 → 2072.48] they left Antioch in Syria.
[2072.48 → 2076.02] And they were visiting the churches
[2076.02 → 2078.44] that Paul and Barnabas had established
[2078.44 → 2079.78] on their first missionary journey.
[2081.00 → 2082.66] And then we saw last week,
[2082.74 → 2084.46] they picked up Timothy in Lustra.
[2085.14 → 2088.16] But now they are in Antioch, Pistoia,
[2088.50 → 2090.02] and they're ready to now,
[2090.56 → 2092.78] after having visited all these other churches,
[2092.92 → 2094.50] they're ready now to expand the mission.
[2095.20 → 2097.34] They're going to press forward into areas
[2097.34 → 2099.66] where the gospel has not yet been preached.
[2100.58 → 2101.92] And verse 6 tells us
[2101.92 → 2105.30] they wanted to go southwest
[2105.30 → 2107.90] over to the province of Asia.
[2108.82 → 2109.58] And now what,
[2109.76 → 2110.52] sorry, not yet.
[2111.28 → 2112.22] Take that one-off.
[2112.22 → 2116.22] So what might be in Asia
[2116.22 → 2118.70] that would have drawn these missionaries' attention?
[2119.88 → 2122.18] Well, Ephesus was there.
[2122.86 → 2123.22] Ephesus.
[2123.88 → 2124.00] Okay.
[2124.24 → 2128.22] Another huge Gentile port city,
[2128.48 → 2131.52] which was very similar to Antioch in Syria.
[2132.24 → 2136.46] So remember, Antioch was a very multicultural trading port.
[2137.04 → 2139.64] And when they first went to preach the gospel there,
[2140.00 → 2142.28] so many people were coming to faith.
[2142.36 → 2144.32] So many Gentiles were coming to faith in Christ
[2144.32 → 2146.06] that Barnabas was like,
[2146.14 → 2146.78] I need help.
[2146.88 → 2148.00] He goes and gets Paul.
[2148.66 → 2150.72] He brings him back to help him.
[2150.72 → 2153.10] And it becomes this launching point
[2153.10 → 2155.96] for these missionary journeys that they're going on.
[2156.76 → 2159.24] And so they probably thought
[2159.24 → 2163.06] they might have similar success in Ephesus.
[2164.30 → 2164.80] Right?
[2164.80 → 2165.90] Not only that,
[2166.20 → 2167.96] but it was a very natural,
[2168.44 → 2169.92] next geographical step
[2169.92 → 2171.00] in the expansion of the gospel.
[2172.48 → 2173.82] But in verse 6,
[2173.98 → 2174.50] here we go,
[2176.86 → 2178.02] they were, it says,
[2178.58 → 2180.76] kept by the Holy Spirit
[2180.76 → 2182.62] from preaching the word
[2182.62 → 2184.40] in the province of Asia.
[2185.94 → 2186.16] Right?
[2186.26 → 2188.26] It appeared that Asia
[2188.26 → 2190.86] would be a natural, good decision,
[2191.80 → 2193.50] but still God says no.
[2194.40 → 2194.76] Okay?
[2194.80 → 2198.18] Now, we aren't told
[2198.18 → 2200.12] how the Spirit prevented them.
[2200.32 → 2202.44] How did God keep them from going there?
[2202.54 → 2203.62] You know, was it a prophecy?
[2204.42 → 2206.24] Was it maybe kind of sense
[2206.24 → 2207.04] on their hearts?
[2208.04 → 2209.58] Did they have an audible voice
[2209.58 → 2210.80] of the Spirit speaking to them?
[2211.64 → 2213.44] Or was it circumstantial,
[2213.58 → 2214.56] where they deduced
[2214.56 → 2216.12] that the Spirit didn't want them to go?
[2216.20 → 2216.78] We don't know.
[2217.82 → 2217.98] Right?
[2217.98 → 2220.76] The how of the Spirit's communication
[2220.76 → 2222.24] is clearly not Luke's point,
[2222.24 → 2223.86] or he would have told us.
[2224.86 → 2226.90] But because God prevented them
[2226.90 → 2227.74] from going to Asia,
[2228.56 → 2231.18] they headed more northward
[2231.18 → 2232.76] and westward to Mycenae.
[2233.76 → 2235.38] Now, let's see what happens next
[2235.38 → 2236.54] in verse 7.
[2237.54 → 2238.12] It says,
[2238.12 → 2239.10] when they came
[2239.10 → 2240.92] to the border of Mycenae,
[2241.00 → 2242.00] they tried to enter
[2242.00 → 2242.82] Bithynia,
[2243.18 → 2244.44] but the Spirit of Jesus,
[2244.64 → 2245.80] another phrase
[2245.80 → 2246.94] for the Holy Spirit,
[2247.74 → 2249.34] would not allow them
[2249.34 → 2250.04] to go.
[2251.38 → 2251.60] Right?
[2251.66 → 2252.58] So they tried to go north
[2252.58 → 2253.28] into Bithynia,
[2253.36 → 2253.68] but again,
[2253.76 → 2254.22] the Holy Spirit
[2254.22 → 2255.10] would not allow them.
[2255.50 → 2257.50] So on two different occasions,
[2257.50 → 2258.68] they want to preach
[2258.68 → 2259.22] the gospel.
[2259.58 → 2260.78] They want to reach people
[2260.78 → 2261.36] with the gospel,
[2261.36 → 2262.64] and God says no.
[2263.68 → 2264.16] Right now,
[2264.24 → 2265.72] that is a remarkable thing.
[2267.04 → 2268.34] So what ends up happening?
[2268.70 → 2270.44] They can't go south
[2270.44 → 2271.48] into Asia.
[2271.72 → 2273.10] They can't go north
[2273.10 → 2274.16] into Bithynia,
[2274.48 → 2276.16] so they go west.
[2276.82 → 2278.28] And they go to the seaport
[2278.28 → 2279.02] of tRNAs.
[2279.90 → 2280.68] Now, we just covered
[2280.68 → 2281.38] a lot of geography,
[2281.64 → 2283.22] so let's put up our map.
[2284.06 → 2285.34] We'll get a visual picture
[2285.34 → 2287.08] of what is going on here.
[2287.38 → 2288.32] So you can see there
[2288.32 → 2289.52] that they were in
[2289.52 → 2291.56] Antioch and Pistoia.
[2292.22 → 2293.36] This was after they visited
[2293.36 → 2293.84] the churches
[2293.84 → 2294.98] on their first missionary journey.
[2295.66 → 2296.40] So you can see
[2296.40 → 2297.60] on the bottom,
[2297.82 → 2298.18] Ephesus.
[2298.64 → 2299.56] They wanted to go
[2299.56 → 2300.48] into Asia,
[2301.02 → 2302.04] probably to Ephesus.
[2302.14 → 2302.62] It doesn't say,
[2302.70 → 2303.38] but we can guess.
[2304.24 → 2305.12] The Holy Spirit says no.
[2305.28 → 2307.22] Okay, so they go northward.
[2307.30 → 2308.58] You can see the red path
[2308.58 → 2309.86] is where they went.
[2310.20 → 2310.82] They went up.
[2310.86 → 2311.22] They say,
[2311.32 → 2312.12] okay, they get to the border
[2312.12 → 2312.84] of Bithynia.
[2312.94 → 2313.68] Let's go up.
[2314.40 → 2315.18] God says no.
[2315.70 → 2316.06] Okay?
[2317.26 → 2318.06] So they go westward,
[2318.06 → 2318.66] westward,
[2319.02 → 2321.62] and they get to tRNAs,
[2321.70 → 2322.48] which you can see there
[2322.48 → 2322.96] in the sea.
[2324.36 → 2325.94] Now, I think it's sometimes
[2325.94 → 2327.92] helpful in these narratives,
[2328.20 → 2328.38] right,
[2328.42 → 2329.32] where we're reading about
[2329.32 → 2330.58] these fellow Christians,
[2331.18 → 2332.40] they're trying to serve God
[2332.40 → 2332.96] in their lives.
[2333.04 → 2334.48] It's helpful to put ourselves
[2334.48 → 2335.82] in their shoes,
[2336.62 → 2337.88] put ourselves in their position.
[2339.18 → 2341.20] One author I read this week,
[2341.26 → 2341.98] he writes this.
[2341.98 → 2344.36] The missionary group
[2344.36 → 2345.94] must have been
[2345.94 → 2348.52] thoroughly perplexed.
[2349.52 → 2350.44] They must have been
[2350.44 → 2351.78] thoroughly perplexed
[2351.78 → 2353.36] as they were led away
[2353.36 → 2355.44] from the cities of Bithynia
[2355.44 → 2357.80] through the wild back countries,
[2358.96 → 2360.26] the wild back woods
[2360.26 → 2361.94] of Mycenae,
[2362.26 → 2363.26] over to the coast
[2363.26 → 2364.06] and down to tRNAs.
[2365.38 → 2365.68] Right?
[2365.68 → 2366.54] They had stepped out
[2366.54 → 2367.96] in faith twice
[2367.96 → 2369.36] and God says,
[2369.84 → 2370.64] no, turn around.
[2370.96 → 2372.18] No, don't go that way.
[2373.60 → 2373.92] You know,
[2373.98 → 2374.90] and we can't see it
[2374.90 → 2375.38] unless, you know,
[2375.40 → 2376.60] we just saw that map there,
[2376.76 → 2377.96] but God is sending them
[2377.96 → 2378.74] on a massive
[2378.74 → 2381.22] 400-mile journey.
[2382.18 → 2382.40] Right?
[2382.46 → 2383.02] Let's just stop
[2383.02 → 2383.72] and think about that.
[2383.90 → 2384.04] Okay?
[2384.04 → 2385.34] They did not have Air Canada
[2385.34 → 2386.98] or whatever your favourite
[2386.98 → 2388.14] airline is.
[2389.24 → 2390.84] They did not have cars.
[2391.42 → 2392.92] They did not have trains.
[2393.68 → 2394.50] It's very likely
[2394.50 → 2395.30] they walked
[2395.30 → 2396.94] the entire way.
[2397.66 → 2398.70] Maybe they had some mules
[2398.70 → 2399.26] to help them.
[2399.30 → 2399.82] We don't know.
[2400.04 → 2401.94] But this was a difficult journey.
[2403.50 → 2404.44] They were trying
[2404.44 → 2406.16] to follow God's leading.
[2406.98 → 2408.48] So they kept heading west
[2408.48 → 2409.28] until they reached
[2409.28 → 2410.18] the Aegean Sea,
[2410.58 → 2411.70] the city of tRNAs.
[2411.80 → 2413.48] And now tRNAs itself
[2413.48 → 2414.82] was an important city.
[2415.38 → 2416.80] It was a crowded harbour.
[2416.96 → 2418.74] It was an important sea link
[2418.74 → 2420.16] to Macedonia and Greece
[2420.16 → 2420.66] and Europe.
[2421.50 → 2422.26] So they said,
[2422.26 → 2424.14] hey, maybe God wants us
[2424.14 → 2425.66] to evangelize this
[2425.66 → 2428.24] important strategic city.
[2429.62 → 2430.62] But again,
[2430.80 → 2432.26] God has other plans.
[2433.12 → 2434.22] Let's look at verse 9.
[2436.08 → 2437.02] During the night,
[2437.14 → 2438.06] Paul had a vision
[2438.06 → 2439.54] of a man of Macedonia
[2439.54 → 2441.22] standing and begging him,
[2441.56 → 2442.98] come over to Macedonia
[2442.98 → 2443.98] and help us.
[2444.90 → 2446.24] So finally at tRNAs,
[2446.34 → 2447.22] Paul gets his vision
[2447.22 → 2447.98] from God
[2447.98 → 2448.82] about a man
[2448.82 → 2449.90] calling him
[2449.90 → 2450.84] from Macedonia.
[2450.84 → 2453.68] And what we find
[2453.68 → 2455.70] is that there are
[2455.70 → 2456.84] certain places
[2456.84 → 2458.04] where there is
[2458.04 → 2458.68] greater need.
[2460.14 → 2461.22] And this obviously
[2461.22 → 2462.44] appears to be the case.
[2462.88 → 2464.56] There is a great need
[2464.56 → 2465.34] in Macedonia
[2465.34 → 2466.28] and God wants
[2466.28 → 2467.40] Paul and Timothy there.
[2468.98 → 2470.24] And this missionary team,
[2470.28 → 2470.42] right,
[2470.46 → 2471.90] they come to the conclusion
[2471.90 → 2473.98] that this is,
[2474.00 → 2474.46] this vision,
[2474.56 → 2475.74] this is God's way
[2475.74 → 2476.56] of communicating
[2476.56 → 2478.02] that he wants them
[2478.02 → 2479.26] to go to Macedonia.
[2479.76 → 2481.20] Come to Macedonia
[2481.20 → 2482.54] and help us.
[2483.74 → 2483.98] You know,
[2484.02 → 2484.78] those are always
[2484.78 → 2486.10] very moving words.
[2487.26 → 2488.12] When people,
[2488.24 → 2488.34] you know,
[2488.42 → 2489.30] whoever they may be,
[2489.40 → 2489.88] they say,
[2490.14 → 2491.88] come and help us.
[2492.80 → 2493.06] You know,
[2493.08 → 2494.18] when I was called
[2494.18 → 2495.00] to come
[2495.00 → 2496.50] and pastor here
[2496.50 → 2497.52] at Ladder CRC,
[2497.62 → 2498.52] it wasn't a vision
[2498.52 → 2499.74] of a man from Macedonia.
[2499.74 → 2501.76] It was Ernst de Vries,
[2502.48 → 2504.34] a man from Ladder.
[2505.38 → 2506.50] He took me out to lunch
[2506.50 → 2507.18] and he said,
[2507.94 → 2509.16] come and help us.
[2510.52 → 2510.76] You know,
[2510.82 → 2511.94] those are precious words.
[2512.66 → 2513.90] When a fellow Christian
[2513.90 → 2515.00] is willing to say
[2515.00 → 2515.92] those words to others,
[2516.34 → 2517.86] come and help us.
[2517.90 → 2519.08] It's often the way
[2519.08 → 2520.08] God calls us
[2520.08 → 2521.26] in our lives.
[2522.58 → 2522.90] Now,
[2522.96 → 2523.66] what's interesting,
[2523.86 → 2525.26] just before we carry on,
[2525.82 → 2526.76] is that God
[2526.76 → 2527.68] hadn't forgotten
[2527.68 → 2528.32] the cities
[2528.32 → 2529.72] that Paul had bypassed.
[2530.50 → 2530.70] Right?
[2530.74 → 2531.30] When the Spirit
[2531.30 → 2532.10] didn't allow
[2532.10 → 2532.90] Paul and Timothy
[2532.90 → 2534.18] to go to those
[2534.18 → 2534.90] certain places,
[2534.90 → 2536.20] we actually find out
[2536.20 → 2537.74] from 1 Peter 1,
[2537.84 → 2538.30] verse 1,
[2538.82 → 2539.54] that Peter,
[2539.76 → 2540.74] he's writing
[2540.74 → 2541.66] to those churches
[2541.66 → 2543.58] that Paul didn't go to.
[2543.88 → 2545.04] He writes to the churches
[2545.04 → 2545.78] in Asia,
[2546.36 → 2547.02] in Bithynia.
[2548.02 → 2549.14] God wanted
[2549.14 → 2551.98] Paul in Macedonia.
[2553.10 → 2554.78] Peter would end up
[2554.78 → 2556.18] dealing with all those cities,
[2556.66 → 2557.32] those people,
[2558.00 → 2559.10] that he bypassed.
[2559.10 → 2560.50] And that's very important.
[2561.42 → 2562.08] It's not as though
[2562.08 → 2563.14] God didn't care for them.
[2563.90 → 2564.98] It was just a case
[2564.98 → 2565.46] of where,
[2565.60 → 2566.72] where should Paul be?
[2567.46 → 2568.30] He wanted Paul
[2568.30 → 2569.24] to go to Philippi
[2569.24 → 2569.94] in Macedonia.
[2570.06 → 2570.44] It's going to be
[2570.44 → 2572.00] an important partner church
[2572.00 → 2573.58] for Paul in the future.
[2575.66 → 2576.92] So that's a survey
[2576.92 → 2577.76] of the content
[2577.76 → 2578.86] of the passage
[2578.86 → 2579.52] this morning.
[2580.74 → 2581.26] Interesting,
[2581.84 → 2583.10] a bit strange,
[2583.30 → 2583.58] maybe,
[2583.70 → 2583.92] you know,
[2583.92 → 2584.82] with this vision.
[2586.34 → 2586.74] Now,
[2586.94 → 2588.52] why did Luke,
[2588.64 → 2590.10] the author of Acts,
[2590.64 → 2591.54] feel the need
[2591.54 → 2592.46] to tell us this?
[2593.02 → 2594.14] Why did he write
[2594.14 → 2595.30] this down for us?
[2596.44 → 2597.12] What does this have
[2597.12 → 2597.94] to do with us?
[2598.94 → 2599.14] You know,
[2599.24 → 2600.14] as Christians,
[2600.38 → 2601.82] we read the Bible.
[2602.04 → 2603.36] It's God's word to us.
[2603.50 → 2604.10] God's speaking,
[2604.32 → 2604.80] communicating.
[2606.62 → 2607.30] And we know
[2607.30 → 2608.26] God's commands.
[2608.86 → 2609.60] We know how
[2609.60 → 2610.52] he is calling us
[2610.52 → 2611.10] to live.
[2611.10 → 2612.74] And if I were
[2612.74 → 2613.62] to ask you this morning,
[2613.74 → 2614.64] is it God's will
[2614.64 → 2615.66] for you to scam
[2615.66 → 2616.44] a bunch of people
[2616.44 → 2616.96] with this,
[2617.30 → 2617.50] you know,
[2617.56 → 2618.82] maybe a cryptocurrency
[2618.82 → 2619.90] Ponzi scheme?
[2621.64 → 2622.48] Your response
[2622.48 → 2622.86] would be,
[2623.08 → 2623.92] no.
[2624.54 → 2624.98] Right?
[2625.02 → 2626.38] That is not God's
[2626.38 → 2627.34] will, right?
[2627.64 → 2628.16] We got that.
[2629.32 → 2630.00] But, you know,
[2630.06 → 2630.86] aside from God's
[2630.86 → 2631.66] general will,
[2631.74 → 2632.34] we read about
[2632.34 → 2633.26] his commands.
[2634.80 → 2634.88] We,
[2635.14 → 2636.78] assuming that as Christians
[2636.78 → 2638.00] we all want to obey God,
[2638.04 → 2638.58] we want to follow
[2638.58 → 2639.22] his commands,
[2639.22 → 2641.54] sometimes what we find
[2641.54 → 2642.86] is God does actually
[2642.86 → 2643.96] lead us
[2643.96 → 2645.08] and guide us
[2645.08 → 2646.32] personally
[2646.32 → 2648.54] in more specific ways.
[2649.00 → 2650.00] Just like we find
[2650.00 → 2650.38] Paul,
[2650.72 → 2651.08] or God,
[2651.16 → 2651.96] doing here with Paul.
[2652.72 → 2652.96] Right?
[2653.06 → 2654.12] God does guide us.
[2654.60 → 2655.62] He does lead us,
[2655.66 → 2656.38] aside from
[2656.38 → 2657.76] just his general will
[2657.76 → 2658.64] of how he wants us
[2658.64 → 2659.14] to live.
[2660.18 → 2660.92] So now,
[2661.04 → 2661.70] I just want to look
[2661.70 → 2663.22] at a few main takeaways
[2663.22 → 2665.12] that I think God
[2665.12 → 2667.68] intends for us today.
[2668.22 → 2668.34] Okay,
[2668.34 → 2668.92] let's look at a few
[2668.92 → 2669.52] main takeaways.
[2670.96 → 2671.94] Number one,
[2672.98 → 2674.42] I think God is telling us
[2674.42 → 2675.38] that it's okay
[2675.38 → 2677.26] and even normal
[2677.26 → 2678.84] that we don't always
[2678.84 → 2679.60] know what to do.
[2680.74 → 2680.90] Okay,
[2680.98 → 2682.38] expect the unexpected
[2682.38 → 2683.46] from God.
[2684.30 → 2684.88] It's okay.
[2684.96 → 2685.52] We don't always know
[2685.52 → 2685.90] what to do
[2685.90 → 2686.50] and that's okay.
[2687.54 → 2687.84] Right?
[2687.90 → 2689.02] For Paul and Silas
[2689.02 → 2689.74] and Timothy,
[2690.20 → 2691.68] I'm sure they were
[2691.68 → 2694.10] completely confused.
[2694.26 → 2695.38] They were perplexed.
[2695.38 → 2696.98] They're setting off
[2696.98 → 2698.28] on this missionary journey.
[2698.56 → 2698.60] Right?
[2698.72 → 2699.96] And for Silas and Timothy,
[2700.06 → 2700.32] remember,
[2700.42 → 2701.30] this is their first journey.
[2701.62 → 2702.24] They've heard all
[2702.24 → 2702.88] of these stories
[2702.88 → 2704.56] about Paul's amazing
[2704.56 → 2705.22] adventures
[2705.22 → 2706.68] and they are,
[2707.06 → 2707.28] you know,
[2707.32 → 2707.94] they're pumped up.
[2708.02 → 2708.78] They're ready to go.
[2709.32 → 2710.52] I'm sure they were expecting
[2710.52 → 2711.32] they're going to preach
[2711.32 → 2712.44] to crowds of people.
[2712.80 → 2713.42] There's going to be
[2713.42 → 2714.22] tons of people
[2714.22 → 2715.24] converting,
[2715.42 → 2716.02] coming to faith
[2716.02 → 2716.60] in Christ.
[2717.12 → 2718.10] Maybe they expected
[2718.10 → 2719.00] some opposition
[2719.00 → 2720.14] and imprisonment.
[2720.62 → 2720.82] You know,
[2720.82 → 2721.56] it's okay.
[2721.74 → 2722.76] God's calling us.
[2723.22 → 2723.62] Maybe they're going
[2723.62 → 2724.50] to see some miracles.
[2725.26 → 2725.56] You know,
[2725.60 → 2725.96] and there's going
[2725.96 → 2726.70] to be a trail
[2726.70 → 2727.58] of churches
[2727.58 → 2729.12] strung out behind them
[2729.12 → 2729.76] wherever they went.
[2731.70 → 2732.64] They were ready
[2732.64 → 2733.36] for God to do
[2733.36 → 2734.26] amazing things
[2734.26 → 2734.94] right now,
[2735.58 → 2736.76] following their plan
[2736.76 → 2737.46] where they're going
[2737.46 → 2737.82] to go.
[2738.94 → 2739.74] But instead,
[2739.98 → 2741.18] God had other plans
[2741.18 → 2742.40] that were totally
[2742.40 → 2743.52] unexpected.
[2746.72 → 2747.74] At the end
[2747.74 → 2749.34] of Romans chapter 11,
[2749.34 → 2750.64] Paul writes this
[2750.64 → 2752.90] from personal experience.
[2753.38 → 2754.26] This is what he says.
[2754.84 → 2754.92] Oh,
[2755.00 → 2755.52] the depth
[2755.52 → 2756.16] of the riches
[2756.16 → 2757.00] of the wisdom
[2757.00 → 2758.06] and knowledge of God.
[2758.62 → 2760.06] How unsearchable
[2760.06 → 2760.76] his judgments,
[2761.34 → 2762.16] his paths
[2762.16 → 2763.46] beyond tracing out.
[2763.80 → 2764.44] Who has known
[2764.44 → 2765.48] the mind of the Lord
[2765.48 → 2767.06] or who has been
[2767.06 → 2768.16] his counsellor?
[2769.94 → 2770.16] Right?
[2770.22 → 2770.82] Who has known
[2770.82 → 2771.72] the mind of the Lord?
[2773.88 → 2774.92] We wish we knew
[2774.92 → 2775.90] the mind of the Lord
[2775.90 → 2776.88] so much in life.
[2777.00 → 2777.12] You know,
[2777.44 → 2778.66] often there are parts
[2778.66 → 2779.62] there are times
[2779.62 → 2780.12] there are parts
[2780.12 → 2780.80] of our life
[2780.80 → 2782.56] just like where
[2782.56 → 2784.08] Paul and Silas
[2784.08 → 2784.46] and Timothy
[2784.46 → 2785.06] there are times
[2785.06 → 2786.52] when we are
[2786.52 → 2787.46] looking for direction.
[2788.78 → 2789.28] Right?
[2789.32 → 2790.14] We're not sure
[2790.14 → 2791.30] what God
[2791.30 → 2792.50] wants
[2792.50 → 2794.14] from us
[2794.14 → 2795.12] even if we're
[2795.12 → 2796.10] willing to follow
[2796.10 → 2796.64] where he
[2796.64 → 2798.18] would have us go.
[2799.48 → 2800.04] You know,
[2800.08 → 2800.70] and that's okay.
[2801.76 → 2802.32] In fact,
[2802.38 → 2803.56] not only is it okay,
[2804.40 → 2805.18] it seems to be
[2805.18 → 2806.40] by divine intention.
[2806.40 → 2808.36] It seems to be
[2808.36 → 2810.14] by God's design
[2810.14 → 2811.46] for it to be that way.
[2812.28 → 2812.88] We don't know
[2812.88 → 2813.68] why God doesn't
[2813.68 → 2814.30] always give us
[2814.30 → 2815.32] the answers we want.
[2816.32 → 2817.40] But certainly,
[2817.80 → 2819.46] it's a matter of faith.
[2820.80 → 2821.24] Certainly,
[2821.36 → 2822.18] it's a matter of faith.
[2823.04 → 2823.14] Right?
[2823.24 → 2824.14] God wants us
[2824.14 → 2826.10] not always to know
[2826.10 → 2827.30] exactly what he wants,
[2827.36 → 2828.02] but he wants us
[2828.02 → 2828.66] to trust him.
[2829.58 → 2829.88] Right?
[2829.92 → 2830.38] He wants us
[2830.38 → 2831.46] to rely on him,
[2831.86 → 2832.80] to seek him
[2832.80 → 2833.46] for guidance,
[2833.54 → 2834.00] to say,
[2834.00 → 2834.24] well,
[2834.40 → 2835.54] I don't know the way.
[2836.10 → 2836.52] So God,
[2836.64 → 2837.36] I'm going to
[2837.36 → 2839.02] call on you.
[2839.08 → 2840.22] I'm going to turn to you.
[2840.24 → 2841.22] I'm going to look to you.
[2841.44 → 2842.60] That's what God wants.
[2843.10 → 2843.92] That's his will,
[2844.06 → 2844.30] right,
[2844.34 → 2844.84] for us,
[2844.88 → 2845.38] our lives.
[2845.68 → 2846.64] He wants us
[2846.64 → 2847.70] to look to him.
[2848.22 → 2848.74] He wants us
[2848.74 → 2849.48] to trust in him.
[2850.78 → 2851.10] So,
[2851.82 → 2852.20] one,
[2852.32 → 2853.02] let's expect
[2853.02 → 2853.88] the unexpected.
[2855.58 → 2855.98] Second,
[2856.98 → 2858.00] usually when we try
[2858.00 → 2859.10] to follow God's will,
[2859.96 → 2861.28] we just need to make
[2861.28 → 2862.08] the best decisions
[2862.08 → 2862.56] we can.
[2862.88 → 2863.00] Okay,
[2863.00 → 2863.72] that's the second point.
[2863.92 → 2864.78] Make the best decisions
[2864.78 → 2865.18] we can.
[2865.50 → 2866.78] Even for the Apostle Paul,
[2866.98 → 2868.10] it's not like he's getting
[2868.10 → 2869.16] supernatural guidance
[2869.16 → 2869.92] all the time.
[2870.92 → 2871.04] Right?
[2871.16 → 2872.02] Paul did not live
[2872.02 → 2872.58] his life
[2872.58 → 2873.66] by constant
[2873.66 → 2875.10] supernatural words
[2875.10 → 2875.94] from God.
[2877.12 → 2878.40] Look what Paul writes
[2878.40 → 2879.36] in 1 Corinthians
[2879.36 → 2880.96] chapter 16
[2880.96 → 2882.68] verses 5 to 9.
[2883.22 → 2884.04] This is what Paul writes
[2884.04 → 2884.54] to the Corinthians.
[2885.46 → 2886.08] So this is,
[2886.16 → 2886.32] you know,
[2886.34 → 2886.98] a personal letter
[2886.98 → 2887.56] to the churches.
[2887.72 → 2888.06] He says,
[2888.18 → 2888.96] after I go through
[2888.96 → 2889.60] Macedonia,
[2889.84 → 2891.20] I will come to you,
[2891.64 → 2892.48] for I will be going
[2892.48 → 2893.28] through Macedonia.
[2893.84 → 2894.62] Perhaps I will stay
[2894.62 → 2895.38] with you for a while,
[2895.56 → 2896.86] or even spend the winter,
[2897.32 → 2898.38] so that you can help me
[2898.38 → 2898.92] on my journey
[2898.92 → 2899.66] wherever I go.
[2900.50 → 2901.34] For I do not want
[2901.34 → 2902.16] to see you now
[2902.16 → 2903.78] and make only a passing visit.
[2904.74 → 2905.92] I hope to spend
[2905.92 → 2906.78] some time with you,
[2906.94 → 2907.80] if the Lord permits.
[2908.48 → 2909.62] But I will stay on
[2909.62 → 2910.06] at Ephesus
[2910.06 → 2911.12] until Pentecost,
[2911.54 → 2912.62] because a great door
[2912.62 → 2913.64] for effective work
[2913.64 → 2915.06] has been opened to me.
[2916.98 → 2917.94] What's going on here?
[2917.94 → 2919.22] Right?
[2919.26 → 2920.20] What's Paul doing?
[2920.82 → 2922.86] Paul is making plans.
[2923.44 → 2924.70] He has hopes.
[2925.58 → 2926.66] He has desires
[2926.66 → 2927.64] of what he wants to do.
[2928.30 → 2929.98] He's following opportunities.
[2930.86 → 2931.78] And all the while,
[2931.90 → 2932.62] he's just trusting
[2932.62 → 2933.48] that God is going
[2933.48 → 2934.22] to guide him
[2934.22 → 2935.26] as he makes
[2935.26 → 2936.68] these decisions.
[2938.04 → 2938.34] Right?
[2938.38 → 2939.04] In other words,
[2939.14 → 2940.00] Paul makes decisions
[2940.00 → 2941.36] by what seems best
[2941.36 → 2942.70] under the circumstances.
[2943.30 → 2944.78] Sometimes it's very practical.
[2944.78 → 2947.80] Sometimes he's being persecuted
[2947.80 → 2948.74] and he has to flee.
[2950.16 → 2952.76] Sometimes he follows
[2952.76 → 2953.98] the spirit's somewhat
[2953.98 → 2955.18] unusual guidance.
[2955.66 → 2956.12] Right?
[2956.18 → 2956.94] Just like a vision.
[2957.88 → 2958.78] But notice that
[2958.78 → 2959.62] even when he gets
[2959.62 → 2960.16] this vision
[2960.16 → 2961.44] of the man from Macedonia,
[2961.90 → 2964.78] it comes when God
[2964.78 → 2965.86] wants to lead him
[2965.86 → 2969.20] apart from the normal ways
[2969.20 → 2970.00] in which people
[2970.00 → 2970.60] make choices.
[2971.84 → 2973.40] So while we can be open,
[2973.50 → 2974.52] I think we should be open
[2974.52 → 2975.72] to God guiding us
[2975.72 → 2977.60] through visions and dreams.
[2978.08 → 2979.22] God can work that way.
[2979.30 → 2980.00] I don't think we should
[2980.00 → 2981.02] expect it all the time.
[2982.56 → 2982.72] You know,
[2982.76 → 2984.22] and we never see Paul saying,
[2984.82 → 2985.12] like,
[2985.28 → 2986.08] sitting there and saying,
[2986.18 → 2986.84] I'm not moving
[2986.84 → 2988.04] until God tells me
[2988.04 → 2989.48] exactly what to do.
[2990.26 → 2990.46] No.
[2990.90 → 2991.10] God,
[2991.60 → 2993.18] Paul knows what to do.
[2993.26 → 2993.92] Make disciples.
[2994.60 → 2995.22] Preach the gospel
[2995.22 → 2995.98] to all the nations.
[2996.30 → 2997.30] So he's going to go.
[2997.40 → 2997.92] He's on mission.
[2998.00 → 2998.40] He's going.
[2999.60 → 3000.62] But he's doing it
[3000.62 → 3001.22] prayerfully,
[3002.42 → 3003.76] seeking the Lord's guidance,
[3004.46 → 3005.60] submitting all of his decisions
[3005.60 → 3006.06] to God
[3006.06 → 3006.76] and then just making
[3006.76 → 3008.00] the best decision he can,
[3008.44 → 3009.06] knowing that God
[3009.06 → 3009.62] will lead him.
[3011.14 → 3011.50] Right?
[3011.58 → 3013.08] And so he is keenly aware
[3013.08 → 3014.28] of this God
[3014.28 → 3015.96] who is personally
[3016.48 → 3017.42] leading him.
[3018.50 → 3018.72] Right?
[3018.84 → 3019.24] And so,
[3019.36 → 3019.64] you know what?
[3019.72 → 3020.60] Jesus is a person.
[3021.56 → 3022.14] And Jesus,
[3022.52 → 3023.58] as a person,
[3024.58 → 3026.94] deals with you and me
[3026.94 → 3029.00] in beautifully personal ways.
[3029.54 → 3030.22] Following Jesus
[3030.22 → 3030.98] isn't just like,
[3031.02 → 3031.12] you know,
[3031.12 → 3032.46] you get your Ikea booklet,
[3032.78 → 3033.18] step one,
[3033.26 → 3033.62] step two,
[3033.72 → 3034.32] do this in order.
[3034.94 → 3035.06] Right?
[3035.12 → 3035.34] No.
[3035.56 → 3036.08] We're following
[3036.08 → 3037.48] a Saviour
[3037.48 → 3039.30] who is beautifully
[3039.30 → 3040.18] orchestrating
[3040.18 → 3040.70] and weaving
[3040.70 → 3041.72] our lives.
[3042.26 → 3042.92] And it's different
[3042.92 → 3043.82] for each one of us.
[3047.72 → 3049.72] The third takeaway here
[3049.72 → 3050.80] about God's guidance
[3050.80 → 3051.72] is I think
[3051.72 → 3052.60] we tend to forget
[3052.60 → 3053.64] that God doesn't
[3053.64 → 3054.78] always line up
[3054.78 → 3055.92] our strengths
[3055.92 → 3056.64] and desires
[3056.64 → 3058.38] with his plan
[3058.38 → 3059.06] for our lives.
[3059.06 → 3059.92] Sometimes what God
[3059.92 → 3061.38] is going to do
[3061.38 → 3061.72] with us
[3061.72 → 3062.60] and what we feel
[3062.60 → 3064.40] like we ought to do,
[3064.52 → 3065.46] what we could do,
[3065.54 → 3066.52] are not the same.
[3067.32 → 3068.30] Sometimes they are.
[3068.56 → 3069.62] And isn't it that nice?
[3070.20 → 3070.38] Right?
[3070.40 → 3071.08] When God puts us
[3071.08 → 3071.68] in a situation
[3071.68 → 3072.40] where we feel
[3072.40 → 3073.64] that we are perfectly
[3073.64 → 3075.52] equipped for that situation.
[3077.44 → 3078.82] But that's not often
[3078.82 → 3080.60] the way it works.
[3081.98 → 3082.14] You know,
[3082.20 → 3082.80] and so Paul,
[3082.94 → 3083.92] he initially had
[3083.92 → 3085.04] good reasons
[3085.04 → 3086.18] for the directions
[3086.18 → 3086.74] that he was going
[3086.74 → 3087.14] to go in.
[3087.14 → 3088.46] He thought
[3088.46 → 3089.26] they should be
[3089.26 → 3090.12] ministering in Asia.
[3090.46 → 3091.24] He was wrong.
[3092.40 → 3093.24] But I'm sure
[3093.24 → 3094.14] it seemed
[3094.14 → 3095.14] wise
[3095.14 → 3096.18] and godly.
[3096.54 → 3097.38] It probably made
[3097.38 → 3098.02] the most sense
[3098.02 → 3098.74] in his mind.
[3099.84 → 3100.32] And I think
[3100.32 → 3101.90] for most of us,
[3102.34 → 3103.58] we can think
[3103.58 → 3104.14] of examples
[3104.14 → 3105.12] in our own lives
[3105.12 → 3105.84] where we thought,
[3106.56 → 3106.72] yeah,
[3106.80 → 3107.64] this is the path
[3107.64 → 3108.82] that God is leading me on.
[3109.12 → 3109.22] Right?
[3109.28 → 3110.80] This is this open door
[3110.80 → 3111.86] that God has given me
[3111.86 → 3112.32] in this point
[3112.32 → 3112.98] in my life
[3112.98 → 3113.66] and then suddenly
[3113.66 → 3114.94] it closes
[3114.94 → 3116.68] and we end up
[3116.68 → 3117.06] somewhere
[3117.06 → 3118.36] we never thought
[3118.36 → 3119.20] we would be.
[3120.92 → 3121.64] And that's how
[3121.64 → 3122.16] I got here.
[3122.60 → 3123.54] So many times
[3123.54 → 3124.02] in my life,
[3124.54 → 3125.44] you just follow
[3125.44 → 3126.86] the way the Lord
[3126.86 → 3127.24] leaves.
[3127.36 → 3128.02] This door opens,
[3128.10 → 3128.60] this door closes.
[3128.66 → 3129.12] This is not what
[3129.12 → 3129.78] I thought to happen,
[3129.84 → 3130.74] but here I am here.
[3132.46 → 3133.16] This is the way
[3133.16 → 3133.76] God works.
[3134.86 → 3135.46] And I think
[3135.46 → 3136.44] one of the main reasons
[3136.44 → 3137.52] why God does that
[3137.52 → 3139.26] is he constantly
[3139.26 → 3140.58] tells us in his word
[3140.58 → 3142.28] that he is glorified
[3142.28 → 3143.50] in our weakness.
[3144.54 → 3144.76] Right?
[3144.80 → 3145.66] Not in our strengths.
[3145.92 → 3147.22] He's not most glorified
[3147.22 → 3148.24] when he puts us
[3148.24 → 3149.26] in situations
[3149.26 → 3151.54] where our own strengths
[3151.54 → 3152.32] can just like
[3152.32 → 3153.74] be on display.
[3154.38 → 3154.68] No.
[3157.32 → 3158.38] Think of Moses.
[3159.32 → 3159.54] Right?
[3159.62 → 3160.46] Moses is out there.
[3160.58 → 3161.48] He's shepherding goats
[3161.48 → 3162.08] in the wilderness.
[3163.20 → 3164.12] God appears to him
[3164.12 → 3164.80] in the burning bush
[3164.80 → 3165.38] and tells him
[3165.38 → 3166.50] he is going to go to Pharaoh,
[3166.60 → 3167.44] the most powerful man
[3167.44 → 3167.90] in the world,
[3167.90 → 3169.14] and he's going to demand
[3169.14 → 3170.10] that Pharaoh,
[3170.60 → 3171.26] listen to him
[3171.26 → 3172.34] and let all of these
[3172.34 → 3172.88] people go.
[3173.70 → 3174.58] And Moses is like,
[3175.12 → 3176.52] no God,
[3176.76 → 3177.02] no.
[3177.70 → 3177.92] Right?
[3178.24 → 3178.62] I mean,
[3178.68 → 3179.10] that's kind of,
[3179.24 → 3180.20] that's a nice idea,
[3180.70 → 3181.10] but hello?
[3181.80 → 3182.00] Like,
[3182.08 → 3183.62] I'm not the guy for this.
[3183.66 → 3184.38] I am not a leader.
[3185.46 → 3185.86] I don't,
[3185.98 → 3186.38] they're not going to
[3186.38 → 3186.98] listen to me.
[3187.20 → 3187.82] I don't even know
[3187.82 → 3188.18] what to say.
[3188.22 → 3189.00] I don't speak too good
[3189.00 → 3189.40] anyway.
[3190.74 → 3192.14] And how does God respond?
[3192.24 → 3192.64] He says,
[3192.80 → 3193.80] I will be with you.
[3194.56 → 3195.36] I will tell you
[3195.36 → 3195.90] what to say.
[3197.04 → 3197.18] Right?
[3197.18 → 3198.18] God is going to do it.
[3198.40 → 3199.00] Not Moses.
[3199.14 → 3201.76] Or think of Gideon.
[3202.44 → 3202.56] Right?
[3202.60 → 3203.22] He's going to fight
[3203.22 → 3203.86] God's enemies.
[3204.00 → 3204.86] He's got an army
[3204.86 → 3205.96] of 10,000 people.
[3206.90 → 3207.70] And God's just like,
[3208.00 → 3208.52] whittle it down.
[3209.56 → 3210.18] Whittle it down.
[3211.30 → 3211.88] Get them down
[3211.88 → 3212.58] until you've got
[3212.58 → 3214.10] only 300 men.
[3215.02 → 3216.26] Just to make the point
[3216.26 → 3217.38] that it was not
[3217.38 → 3218.22] in their strength,
[3218.38 → 3219.32] it wasn't in their
[3219.32 → 3219.78] abilities,
[3219.90 → 3220.56] it was God
[3220.56 → 3221.52] who was going to
[3221.52 → 3222.28] give them the victory.
[3223.78 → 3224.80] So why does God
[3224.80 → 3225.56] often call us
[3225.56 → 3226.20] to situations
[3226.20 → 3227.18] where we feel
[3227.18 → 3227.86] ill-equipped?
[3227.86 → 3228.78] We feel like
[3228.78 → 3229.32] we don't know
[3229.32 → 3229.76] the answers.
[3229.88 → 3230.38] We're not able
[3230.38 → 3230.98] to do this.
[3231.28 → 3231.84] It's so that
[3231.84 → 3233.20] he could be glorified
[3233.20 → 3233.86] in us.
[3234.48 → 3235.40] It's not about us.
[3235.48 → 3236.86] It's about him
[3236.86 → 3239.18] being glorified
[3239.18 → 3240.02] through our lives.
[3241.18 → 3241.66] And so again,
[3241.74 → 3242.86] we shouldn't be surprised
[3242.86 → 3243.52] when in life
[3243.52 → 3244.30] we kind of feel
[3244.30 → 3245.14] like fish out of water.
[3246.56 → 3247.42] And the impulse
[3247.42 → 3248.92] in that time
[3248.92 → 3250.02] when we feel like
[3250.02 → 3250.80] we can't
[3250.80 → 3252.02] do it in our own
[3252.02 → 3252.56] strength
[3252.56 → 3253.40] and our own wisdom,
[3253.40 → 3254.58] the point
[3254.58 → 3255.68] is to drive
[3255.68 → 3256.32] us back
[3256.32 → 3257.00] to God.
[3259.60 → 3260.80] To go to the one
[3260.80 → 3261.98] who is our strength.
[3262.88 → 3262.96] Right?
[3263.04 → 3263.80] So much of God's
[3263.80 → 3264.78] leading in our lives
[3264.78 → 3266.54] is simply that,
[3266.64 → 3267.38] making us turn
[3267.38 → 3267.76] to him.
[3270.64 → 3271.10] Okay,
[3271.16 → 3271.98] and here's a fourth
[3271.98 → 3273.62] thing.
[3274.68 → 3274.92] You know,
[3274.98 → 3276.16] I find this interesting.
[3277.42 → 3278.48] Even the apostle
[3278.48 → 3278.94] Paul,
[3280.06 → 3280.98] the apostle
[3280.98 → 3282.08] gets a vision
[3282.08 → 3283.10] directly from God.
[3284.02 → 3284.80] His response
[3284.80 → 3285.14] is not,
[3285.26 → 3285.78] okay guys,
[3286.38 → 3286.98] this is what
[3286.98 → 3287.62] we're going to do.
[3288.56 → 3289.76] Notice how Luke,
[3290.12 → 3290.62] who is writing
[3290.62 → 3291.38] the book of Acts
[3291.38 → 3292.26] in verse 10,
[3293.02 → 3293.82] notice how he uses
[3293.82 → 3294.54] the word we.
[3295.46 → 3296.46] Let's look at verse 10.
[3297.44 → 3298.14] After Paul
[3298.14 → 3299.22] had seen the vision,
[3300.44 → 3300.68] we,
[3300.98 → 3301.72] so Luke is writing,
[3301.84 → 3302.68] he's including himself,
[3302.88 → 3303.58] so apparently Luke
[3303.58 → 3304.26] has joined
[3304.26 → 3305.78] this party.
[3306.72 → 3307.62] We got ready
[3307.62 → 3308.40] at once
[3308.40 → 3309.34] to leave
[3309.34 → 3310.18] for Macedonia
[3310.18 → 3311.02] concluding that
[3311.02 → 3311.80] God had called
[3311.80 → 3312.54] us
[3312.54 → 3313.84] to go and preach
[3313.84 → 3314.68] the gospel to them.
[3315.36 → 3315.46] Right?
[3315.66 → 3316.74] We got ready
[3316.74 → 3317.28] at once.
[3317.54 → 3318.26] We concluded
[3318.26 → 3319.52] that God called us.
[3320.32 → 3321.58] So Paul got the vision,
[3321.76 → 3322.34] but he still,
[3322.48 → 3323.66] he goes to his fellow
[3323.66 → 3324.18] Christians
[3324.18 → 3325.68] for wisdom
[3325.68 → 3326.42] and discernment.
[3327.90 → 3328.06] You know,
[3328.10 → 3328.76] I think so often
[3328.76 → 3329.96] the way God guides us
[3329.96 → 3331.52] is through the wise
[3331.52 → 3332.80] counsel of others.
[3334.64 → 3334.86] You know,
[3334.90 → 3335.64] sometimes we want
[3335.64 → 3336.60] God to guide us,
[3337.08 → 3337.98] and we say,
[3337.98 → 3338.34] God,
[3338.96 → 3339.24] you know,
[3339.30 → 3340.18] tell us what you want me
[3340.18 → 3340.64] to do,
[3340.92 → 3341.36] and sometimes
[3341.36 → 3341.90] I think God
[3341.90 → 3342.96] would say to us,
[3343.06 → 3343.92] would you just go
[3343.92 → 3344.86] and talk to another
[3344.86 → 3346.24] brother or sister
[3346.24 → 3347.02] in the Lord,
[3348.10 → 3348.70] and you might
[3348.70 → 3350.48] just hear my voice.
[3351.38 → 3351.52] Hey,
[3351.56 → 3352.76] God saves us
[3352.76 → 3354.28] not just to himself,
[3354.36 → 3354.82] he saves us
[3354.82 → 3355.52] into a community,
[3355.52 → 3356.56] and he guides us
[3356.56 → 3357.80] through the wisdom
[3357.80 → 3358.62] of other brothers
[3358.62 → 3359.04] and sisters
[3359.04 → 3359.56] in our lives.
[3359.62 → 3359.74] Now,
[3359.80 → 3360.36] it shouldn't be
[3360.36 → 3361.46] like a back door
[3361.46 → 3362.18] to God's will,
[3362.30 → 3362.98] like where we don't
[3362.98 → 3363.58] know what to do,
[3363.64 → 3364.48] so we just ask someone,
[3364.48 → 3365.62] and it's not just
[3365.62 → 3366.36] to get their approval,
[3366.64 → 3367.26] we still need to
[3367.26 → 3368.28] follow our own convictions,
[3368.92 → 3370.38] but sometimes other people
[3370.38 → 3371.94] can speak words of wisdom
[3371.94 → 3372.84] into our lives,
[3373.24 → 3374.64] and God does use that.
[3376.00 → 3376.42] Now,
[3376.48 → 3377.36] here's the last thing.
[3380.42 → 3381.54] If we could just,
[3381.60 → 3381.74] you know,
[3381.76 → 3383.40] have one main point
[3383.40 → 3384.26] from this passage
[3384.26 → 3385.64] that I think Luke
[3385.64 → 3386.54] and the Holy Spirit
[3386.54 → 3387.48] intends for us,
[3387.82 → 3388.64] I think it's this,
[3389.28 → 3390.66] that God will guide us.
[3392.24 → 3392.44] Hey,
[3392.48 → 3393.42] God will guide us.
[3393.82 → 3394.26] He will.
[3395.48 → 3395.96] Paul,
[3396.58 → 3396.94] Silas,
[3396.98 → 3397.44] and Timothy,
[3397.68 → 3397.86] you know,
[3397.92 → 3399.04] they're starting to move out
[3399.04 → 3399.80] in one direction.
[3400.64 → 3401.94] They've got great intentions,
[3402.16 → 3403.02] they're making decisions
[3403.02 → 3403.78] the best they can,
[3403.94 → 3404.74] they get it wrong,
[3405.34 → 3406.26] but they don't have
[3406.26 → 3407.36] to be afraid and say,
[3407.78 → 3408.00] you know,
[3408.12 → 3408.94] oh man,
[3409.08 → 3410.62] we have messed up
[3410.62 → 3412.22] God's will for our lives.
[3413.76 → 3414.00] You know,
[3414.06 → 3414.74] they don't need to be
[3414.74 → 3415.84] worried about that,
[3416.12 → 3418.02] because by his spirit,
[3418.12 → 3418.40] you see,
[3418.58 → 3419.28] the Holy Spirit
[3419.28 → 3420.12] shows up twice
[3420.12 → 3421.02] in this short passage.
[3421.44 → 3422.60] The Holy Spirit does this,
[3422.66 → 3423.72] the Holy Spirit does that.
[3424.48 → 3425.92] The Spirit of God
[3425.92 → 3426.62] is leading
[3426.62 → 3427.46] and guiding them,
[3427.88 → 3429.02] even if it wasn't
[3429.02 → 3429.60] as clear
[3429.60 → 3430.26] or as frequent
[3430.26 → 3430.88] or as quick
[3430.88 → 3431.78] as they would have wanted.
[3433.24 → 3433.46] You know,
[3433.52 → 3433.86] and so,
[3434.12 → 3434.94] what we can conclude
[3434.94 → 3436.00] is this,
[3436.06 → 3436.54] that yes,
[3436.66 → 3437.34] God does have
[3437.34 → 3438.20] a specific plan
[3438.20 → 3439.32] for your life.
[3440.06 → 3441.06] And yes,
[3441.12 → 3441.24] you know,
[3441.28 → 3442.30] we can look back
[3442.30 → 3443.48] and we can often trace
[3443.48 → 3444.86] the way God has
[3444.86 → 3447.10] worked in our lives
[3447.10 → 3449.06] as we look back
[3449.06 → 3450.10] at what he has done,
[3450.10 → 3451.74] but we don't need
[3451.74 → 3452.48] to fear
[3452.48 → 3453.74] missing God's will.
[3454.96 → 3455.92] He is sovereign
[3455.92 → 3458.12] and we are in his hands.
[3461.20 → 3461.48] You know,
[3461.74 → 3463.14] sometimes God's guidance
[3463.14 → 3463.70] in our lives
[3463.70 → 3464.26] is different
[3464.26 → 3465.82] from what we think
[3465.82 → 3466.60] is best,
[3467.26 → 3468.50] but ultimately,
[3468.86 → 3469.38] God's guidance
[3469.38 → 3470.28] in our lives
[3470.28 → 3472.72] is for our greatest joy
[3472.72 → 3473.70] and for his glory.
[3473.70 → 3476.44] So let's take a moment now
[3476.44 → 3477.26] and respond to God
[3477.26 → 3477.64] in prayer.
[3480.50 → 3484.60] And I want to invite you
[3484.60 → 3486.42] to pray to God,
[3486.78 → 3487.94] give you a moment of prayer,
[3488.04 → 3489.22] and I want to ask,
[3489.40 → 3490.10] to invite you again,
[3490.22 → 3491.64] to ask God,
[3492.86 → 3493.40] God,
[3493.54 → 3494.62] what is your will for me?
[3496.28 → 3496.56] You know,
[3496.62 → 3497.48] is there an area
[3497.48 → 3498.32] in your life
[3498.32 → 3499.60] where you are seeking
[3499.60 → 3500.70] the Lord's guidance?
[3501.82 → 3503.26] So pray about that right now.
[3504.24 → 3505.18] Ask him to guide you
[3505.18 → 3505.78] and ask him
[3505.78 → 3507.60] to help you
[3507.60 → 3508.62] to trust in him.
[3508.62 → 3508.68] Amen.
[3533.70 → 3540.48] Our Father,
[3540.56 → 3541.46] we praise you
[3541.46 → 3542.86] that you're not just a God
[3542.86 → 3544.62] who is great
[3544.62 → 3545.72] and transcendent
[3545.72 → 3546.30] and holy.
[3547.30 → 3549.14] You are all of those things,
[3549.38 → 3549.82] but Lord,
[3549.92 → 3551.46] you are also near to us.
[3551.92 → 3553.52] And you sent your Holy Spirit,
[3553.64 → 3554.52] the Spirit of Jesus,
[3555.18 → 3556.24] to be with us
[3556.24 → 3557.10] and to guide us.
[3558.04 → 3559.16] We thank you, Lord,
[3559.16 → 3560.62] that you are kind
[3560.62 → 3561.42] and patient.
[3562.22 → 3564.00] You care about our lives,
[3565.00 → 3566.72] the decisions that we make,
[3566.84 → 3568.82] the course that you would lead us in.
[3569.50 → 3569.92] And Lord,
[3570.00 → 3571.56] our lives are in your hands.
[3572.42 → 3572.98] And so, Father,
[3573.20 → 3574.06] help us
[3574.06 → 3575.44] to surrender
[3575.44 → 3577.72] ourselves to you.
[3578.40 → 3579.52] Help us to surrender
[3579.52 → 3581.48] our decisions,
[3581.98 → 3582.72] our desires
[3582.72 → 3583.82] to you.
[3583.82 → 3585.50] because, Lord,
[3585.60 → 3587.16] we want to follow you
[3587.16 → 3588.66] so that our lives
[3588.66 → 3589.20] can be lived
[3589.20 → 3589.92] for your sake
[3589.92 → 3590.60] and not our own.
[3592.38 → 3592.98] So, Lord,
[3593.02 → 3593.90] would you lead us
[3593.90 → 3595.88] and guide each one of us
[3595.88 → 3596.78] and guide us together
[3596.78 → 3598.02] as a church also, Lord,
[3598.06 → 3599.72] to walk in your ways
[3599.72 → 3600.46] for your glory.
[3600.98 → 3602.44] We ask this in Jesus' name.
[3602.86 → 3603.12] Amen.
[3603.36 → 3603.88] Amen.
[3605.36 → 3606.92] Okay, let's stand
[3606.92 → 3607.58] and let's sing
[3607.58 → 3608.58] our song of response,
[3608.74 → 3609.76] He Leader Me.

[3649.38 → 3652.54] that He leader me.

[3656.10 → 3657.38] in me,
[3657.38 → 3660.72] by His heart
[3660.72 → 3663.82] and He leader me.
[3664.22 → 3667.54] His hand in the heart
[3667.54 → 3668.54] will be,
[3668.54 → 3669.54] He leader me.
[3669.54 → 3673.50] For what is that He leader me?
[3673.50 → 3674.50] He leader me.

[3675.50 → 3676.38] He leader me.
[3676.38 → 3676.50] He leader me.

[3680.34 → 3681.78] deepness,
[3681.78 → 3683.24] sometimes,
[3684.24 → 3685.66] when He leads
[3685.66 → 3686.50] flowers,
[3686.50 → 3690.70] my heart is still,

[3692.38 → 3693.38] my heart is still,

[3696.90 → 3700.24] Or to continue me.
[3700.24 → 3701.96] When He leader me.

[3742.24 → 3748.82] It is just like love that hath hidden me.
[3748.82 → 3760.82] He will the reeling of me, my ears on heaven lead in me.
[3761.20 → 3770.54] This will come from our heart for me, for what is the meaning?

[4002.18 → 4005.34] We will act for no living
[4005.34 → 4012.54] For you take us to the pastures of our being
[4012.54 → 4016.80] You lead beside still waters
[4016.80 → 4020.32] Bring refreshing to our souls
[4020.32 → 4026.54] As you guide us in the paths that made us free
[4026.54 → 4031.74] Lead on
[4031.74 → 4036.00] Lead on
[4036.00 → 4038.00] Lead on
[4038.00 → 4045.20] Though we walk through death's dark life
[4045.20 → 4048.96] We will fear no evil thing
[4048.96 → 4056.16] Bearing comfort in the presence of our foes
[4056.16 → 4060.42] You anoint our heads with oil goodness
[4060.42 → 4063.66] And mercy run us down
[4063.66 → 4070.16] As we dwell in your house forevermore
[4070.16 → 4071.20] Lead on
[4071.20 → 4078.82] Weestabacts our hearts
[4078.82 → 4083.14] And mercy run us on
[4083.14 → 4087.58] blindfolded by Building Red
[4087.58 → 4111.46] So before we come to the Lord in prayer this morning,
[4111.46 → 4122.76] it's with a sad heart that we heard about the death of Joyce DeVos, mom of Jim,
[4123.40 → 4126.00] who passed away this week at the age of 93.
[4127.04 → 4134.52] And also, very shortly after, Anita's mom, Phyllis, also passed away on Vancouver Island.
[4134.52 → 4142.96] And so it's a heavy loss for Jim and Anita as both of their moms went home to glory.
[4143.70 → 4149.36] You know, we sang about, you know, crossing the Jordan.
[4149.82 → 4155.18] And often in the, you know, Christians, we use this idea about crossing the Jordan
[4155.18 → 4160.30] into the land of Canaan as the hope of God leading us into this promised land.
[4160.30 → 4164.48] And all of us, he's leading us into our heavenly home.
[4165.22 → 4172.68] And so we do cross that river, and God has led both Joyce and Anita into his presence.
[4172.94 → 4175.04] And so for that, we are thankful.
[4176.12 → 4178.28] But let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[4178.28 → 4188.66] Our gracious God, our loving Heavenly Father, great are you, O Lord.
[4189.50 → 4194.94] Lord, you are the God who has made all things, for this is our Father's world.
[4195.72 → 4197.56] And you are our good shepherd.
[4198.56 → 4202.14] Lord, you lead us in paths of righteousness for your name's sake.
[4202.20 → 4205.92] And you guard us against our foes.
[4205.92 → 4210.86] You protect us, and you lead us into green pastures and besides still waters.
[4211.80 → 4213.66] Lord, you anoint our heads with oil.
[4213.82 → 4218.88] You give us so many good gifts and good things because we are your people.
[4219.64 → 4222.06] Because you do love us, and you care for us.
[4222.98 → 4229.44] And Lord, when we walk through dark valleys, especially Death's Dark Valley, Lord,
[4229.44 → 4232.48] there's nothing that can ultimately harm us.
[4233.58 → 4237.58] Because you have walked through that valley yourself.
[4238.32 → 4242.60] And you have come through, and you have conquered death, and you have conquered sin.
[4243.76 → 4246.30] So Lord, those things lay at your feet.
[4247.42 → 4250.00] You are sovereign over all things.
[4250.72 → 4252.00] You have vanquished hell.
[4252.00 → 4256.74] You have conquered our sin, and you have set us free by your grace.
[4257.92 → 4259.36] So Lord, we are truly free.
[4259.82 → 4261.72] And we are truly safe in your hands.
[4262.50 → 4264.24] We thank you for that precious reality.
[4265.96 → 4274.10] Lord, we thank you for the ministries of our church for which we have today given of our tithes,
[4274.28 → 4275.16] of what you have given us.
[4275.16 → 4279.02] Lord, we lift to you these ministries, Lord, for kids' life.
[4279.30 → 4284.42] Would you teach our children from a young age to know our Lord Jesus.
[4285.20 → 4293.90] Lord, provide teachers and assistance and help in knowing how best to organize and to run their classes.
[4295.00 → 4297.32] Lord, we thank you for our friendship ministry,
[4297.32 → 4305.50] for all of these precious brothers and sisters who you provide this place and this ministry for.
[4305.62 → 4309.00] Lord, to encourage them, to teach them about who God is.
[4310.38 → 4314.60] Lord, we thank you for cadets that had over 20 kids this past Sunday.
[4314.72 → 4316.12] And for gems, I don't know how many.
[4316.30 → 4322.86] But Lord, for these ministries that are getting started, we pray for your continued provision for them.
[4322.86 → 4328.34] Lord, and for the many other opportunities we have to fellowship with one another,
[4328.80 → 4333.50] men's breakfast and our Thursday coffee, for different things.
[4333.58 → 4338.28] Lord, for our Chinese ministry, Lord, we thank you that you are doing something totally unexpected there,
[4339.22 → 4342.78] calling more and more people to yourself.
[4344.38 → 4347.78] Lord, we ask that you continue to work in our church.
[4347.84 → 4351.14] And Lord, again, would you guide us as a congregation.
[4351.14 → 4358.36] Lord, help us to follow in your footsteps, in your path, Lord, trusting that you are going to lead us,
[4358.72 → 4361.88] trusting that you will give us the wisdom to know where to go.
[4362.82 → 4367.14] And no matter where you lead us, Lord, that we would always seek to follow you,
[4367.90 → 4370.28] to obey your commands, to be your church,
[4371.28 → 4375.32] and do the mission that you have given us in Ladder and in Delta.
[4375.32 → 4383.06] Lord, we pray this morning also for those in our congregation suffering loss,
[4383.64 → 4390.86] suffering from sickness, from confusion of not knowing where you are leading them.
[4391.60 → 4394.20] Lord, we especially pray for Jim and Anita this morning, Lord,
[4394.52 → 4402.02] as they grieve the loss of Joyce, who we will also miss being in our presence,
[4402.02 → 4403.78] and also of Phyllis.
[4404.42 → 4407.00] Lord, would you bind up their hearts.
[4408.26 → 4409.64] Lord, would you bring comfort.
[4410.62 → 4414.96] And Lord, we thank you for the great promise that you will lead us into Canaan land.
[4416.10 → 4420.64] Lord, for all those also who continue to suffer, we pray for Angela.
[4421.22 → 4423.44] We pray for Shirley.
[4423.44 → 4426.08] We pray for Grace.
[4427.02 → 4429.74] We pray for Annette.
[4429.98 → 4430.90] And Lord, in others.
[4431.78 → 4436.52] Lord, we ask that you would bring your healing hand where we need it.
[4436.56 → 4438.04] Lord, you know our wounds.
[4438.18 → 4446.32] You know where you need to apply the balm of your gracious presence in our lives.
[4446.86 → 4449.92] And so, Lord, all of these things we gather, and we bring to you.
[4449.92 → 4458.32] Because, Lord, in all of these things in our lives, what you want most of all is for our hearts to trust in you and to look to you.
[4458.40 → 4459.30] And so, Lord, we do that.
[4459.80 → 4462.90] We come before you trusting that you are a good God.
[4463.36 → 4465.34] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4465.82 → 4466.06] Amen.

[4485.22 → 4487.58] And so, I invite you to hold out your hands to receive God's blessing.

[4500.62 → 4506.40] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4506.96 → 4507.20] Amen.
