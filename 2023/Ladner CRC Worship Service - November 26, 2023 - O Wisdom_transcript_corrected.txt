[0.40 → 16.76] The
[16.76 → 17.76] Amen.
[46.76 → 47.76] Amen.
[76.76 → 77.76] Amen.
[106.76 → 107.76] Amen.
[136.76 → 137.76] Amen.
[166.76 → 167.76] Amen.
[196.76 → 197.76] Amen.
[226.76 → 227.76] Amen.
[256.76 → 257.76] Amen.
[286.76 → 316.46] Well, good morning.
[316.76 → 327.88] And welcome everyone to our service today. My name is Jake Iron, and I'll be leading us through the liturgical elements of our service this morning before Pastor Jason leads us in exploring God's Word.
[328.66 → 335.38] This being the first Sunday in the Advent season, I'm certainly looking forward to the new sermon series starting today.
[336.08 → 345.38] But don't worry, even with the antiphon or sung prayer theme, I won't be subjecting you all to that today. Or ever. So don't worry.
[345.38 → 355.18] Just one note, in the bulletin it talks about the children being dismissed early during our first praise session.
[355.48 → 359.26] But we're actually going to do that a little bit later, just before we launch into the sermon.
[359.46 → 363.02] So just wait for the announcement and don't disappear during the singing.
[366.02 → 370.18] Our call to worship this morning is based on Isaiah 40 verse 3.
[370.18 → 378.02] A voice cries, in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[378.72 → 387.76] As we worship today, let's prepare to welcome God's dramatic work in our midst, in our hearts, in our community, and in all creation.
[388.58 → 390.50] Please join me in a prayer of adoration.
[390.50 → 395.88] All glorious God, we give you thanks.
[396.84 → 401.30] In your Son, Jesus Christ, you have given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.
[402.26 → 408.20] You chose us before the world was made to be your holy people without fault in your sight.
[409.20 → 411.56] You've adopted us as your children in Christ.
[412.22 → 414.20] You have set us free by his blood.
[414.56 → 415.86] You have forgiven our sins.
[415.86 → 423.12] You have made known to us your secret purpose, to bring heaven and earth into unity in Christ.
[423.86 → 428.56] You have given us your Holy Spirit, the seal and pledge of our inheritance.
[429.38 → 438.46] All praise and glory be yours, O God, for the richness of your grace, for the splendour of your gifts, for the wonder of your love.
[439.24 → 439.52] Amen.
[439.52 → 439.62] Amen.
[441.58 → 445.72] And that was a good time, if you were able, to stand and greet those around you.
[446.18 → 448.02] And then our praise team will come forward after that.
[469.52 → 497.76] Let us join our voices together and sing a worship.
[497.76 → 501.54] Amen.
[505.54 → 520.60] O worship the King, the Lord just the Lord, and pray fully sing, His power and His love.
[520.60 → 527.46] Our shield and defender the ancient of days
[527.46 → 535.20] The hill in His splendour and earth in His place
[535.20 → 542.54] O God of His high, O sing of His praise
[542.54 → 549.56] Whose love is the Lord, whose family stays
[549.56 → 556.60] His chance of life, O King, under the sun
[556.60 → 564.56] And harvest His love on the waves of the storm
[565.42 → 572.28] A naughty old air, the town can be sung
[572.28 → 578.56] His praise in the air, which shines in the light
[578.56 → 585.60] The streets from the hills in His chest will appear
[585.60 → 593.60] And the singing of His hills in the hill in the rain
[593.60 → 600.64] The children of God, the king of Israel
[600.64 → 620.18] Oh Oswald, who's whole and
[620.18 → 621.18] Remember
[621.18 → 622.80] We see
[622.80 → 624.86] Your name
[646.86 → 648.50] I'm
[648.50 → 656.66] Even though you'reseed
[667.10 → 671.64] Me
[678.50 → 682.50] God, how can it be?
[684.18 → 688.50] What you might need to die for me?
[691.56 → 696.50] It's God, I know the truth.
[698.50 → 700.50] It's my joy, Lord.
[700.50 → 730.48] It's my joy, Lord.
[730.50 → 736.50] It's my joy, Lord.
[736.50 → 738.50] It's my glory, Lord.
[742.50 → 749.50] You are my King.
[750.50 → 756.50] You are my King.
[756.50 → 762.50] Jesus, you are my King.
[762.50 → 770.50] Jesus, you are my King.
[770.50 → 776.50] I'm forgiven.
[776.50 → 782.50] You are my King.
[782.50 → 788.50] You are my King.
[788.50 → 790.50] I am God, I know.
[790.50 → 794.50] The Spirit is with me.
[794.50 → 800.50] You are my King.
[800.50 → 806.50] You are my King.
[806.50 → 808.50] You are my King.
[808.50 → 810.50] You are my King.
[810.50 → 812.50] You are my King.
[812.50 → 814.50] You are my King.
[814.50 → 816.50] You are my King.
[816.50 → 818.50] You are my King.
[818.50 → 820.50] You are my King.
[820.50 → 822.50] You are my King.
[822.50 → 826.50] You are my King.
[826.50 → 828.50] You are my King.
[828.50 → 830.50] You are my King.
[830.50 → 832.50] You are my King.
[832.50 → 834.50] You are my King.
[834.50 → 836.50] You are my King.
[836.50 → 838.50] You are my King.
[838.50 → 840.50] You are my King.
[840.50 → 842.50] You are my King.
[842.50 → 854.50] You are my King.
[854.50 → 862.50] We have a reading this morning from Matthew chapter 7 verses 24 through 29.
[862.50 → 868.10] Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like
[868.10 → 871.60] a wise man who built his house on the rock.
[871.60 → 876.76] The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house,
[876.76 → 881.94] yet it did not fall, because it had its foundations on the rock.
[881.94 → 886.00] But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like
[886.00 → 889.82] a foolish man who built his house on sand.
[889.82 → 895.58] The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house,
[895.58 → 898.38] and it fell with a great crash.
[898.38 → 905.62] When Jesus had finished stating these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because
[905.62 → 918.78] he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law.
[919.82 → 949.80] Jesus said, when in thy verse I shall come to him, no one else can satisfy the
[949.80 → 954.80] I shall come to him.
[954.80 → 964.80] Jesus said, if I am weak, I should come to him.
[964.80 → 973.80] No one else can be my strength, I should come to him.
[973.80 → 982.80] For the Lord is good and faithful, we know he must take and die.
[982.80 → 983.80] We can always come to him.
[983.80 → 991.80] We can always come to Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Father, come to him.
[991.80 → 1000.80] Jesus said, if I am weak, I should come to him.
[1000.80 → 1004.80] Jesus said, if I am weak, I should come to him.
[1004.80 → 1005.80] I should come to him.
[1005.80 → 1009.80] I should come to him.
[1009.80 → 1010.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1010.80 → 1014.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1014.80 → 1018.80] I should come to him.
[1018.80 → 1019.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1019.80 → 1020.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1020.80 → 1021.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1021.80 → 1022.80] No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[1022.80 → 1026.80] Jesus said, if I am lost, he will be my shield, I should come to him.
[1026.80 → 1036.34] He will always come to Jesus, Jesus, God, divine.
[1044.48 → 1053.40] Jesus said, if I am lost, he will come to me.
[1053.40 → 1062.84] And he shall be on the cross, he will come to me.
[1063.40 → 1071.40] For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[1072.76 → 1081.54] He will always come to Jesus, Jesus, God, divine.
[1081.54 → 1090.92] For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[1091.46 → 1099.54] He will always come to Jesus, Jesus, God, divine.
[1099.54 → 1104.84] Oh, Jesus, God, divine.
[1118.52 → 1121.76] Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1121.76 → 1128.86] O promised Christ, we are a world at war.
[1129.70 → 1131.52] Our peace depends on your coming.
[1132.40 → 1133.80] We are a sinful people.
[1134.86 → 1136.86] Our pardon depends on your coming.
[1137.74 → 1141.30] We are full of good intentions, but weak at keeping promises.
[1142.36 → 1146.62] Our only hope of doing God's will is that you should come and help us do it.
[1146.62 → 1155.40] Lord Christ, word made flesh, our world waits for your peace, for your pardon, and for your grace.
[1156.18 → 1159.48] Even so, come Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1161.38 → 1166.88] Our confidence as Christians is that in Christ we do have forgiveness of sins.
[1167.40 → 1171.60] We're reminded of that this morning with these words from Romans 8 and Corinthians 5.
[1172.26 → 1173.50] Hear the good news.
[1174.26 → 1175.74] Who is in a position to condemn?
[1176.62 → 1177.34] Only Christ.
[1177.94 → 1179.16] And Christ died for us.
[1179.96 → 1181.08] Christ rose for us.
[1181.74 → 1183.84] Christ reigns in power for us.
[1184.64 → 1186.12] Christ prays for us.
[1187.18 → 1190.94] Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.
[1191.88 → 1193.12] The old life has gone.
[1193.70 → 1194.92] A new life has begun.
[1195.44 → 1198.44] Know that you are forgiven and be at peace.
[1200.56 → 1203.48] Yet not I, but through Christ in me is our next song.
[1203.48 → 1210.34] And at the tail end of that, our Sunday school children age 3 through grade 5 are welcome to go to their classes.
[1210.34 → 1216.20] The end of that, our days are Finals.
[1217.20 → 1221.06] Advance is a very special so we can do our students.
[1221.18 → 1222.40] She wants us Tetzel programs.
[1222.40 → 1222.78] Let us pray, at Apostle 3 through grade 5 are the Beginning of Water, therefore dive Lange than micro stages, O Lord.
[1222.78 → 1225.82] In mind is that it may be a blessing that you can age the Lord.
[1225.88 → 1227.16] いや, we want her to ease a needless rematch without discomfort.
[1227.16 → 1232.26] The grace is Jesus, my reasoner.
[1232.88 → 1238.34] There is no more for heaven now to give.
[1239.20 → 1244.84] He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[1244.84 → 1250.84] My strength, my love, my kingdom, my sin.
[1250.84 → 1257.20] He is my hope, my hope is only Jesus.
[1258.50 → 1263.56] For my life is only bound to me.
[1264.64 → 1269.08] Oh, the strange and divine, my goodness, same.
[1269.08 → 1276.08] All is mine in the heart, the true Christ in me.
[1280.84 → 1290.78] The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[1291.78 → 1297.12] For my life's God, the Saviour, He will stay.
[1297.12 → 1303.12] I'm greater all, He'll lead us every towards me.
[1304.12 → 1309.08] For in my need, His power is to stay.
[1309.08 → 1315.98] Yes, I hold my shepherd, will deter me.
[1316.72 → 1321.34] Through the deep, as I need the wind.
[1322.80 → 1328.08] Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[1328.08 → 1333.72] Therefore, I am through Christ in me.
[1343.72 → 1349.40] Oh, fate I've led, I know I am forgiven.
[1349.40 → 1362.40] Jesus, my Lord, my sin has been defeated.
[1362.40 → 1368.40] Jesus, now, whatever is mine.
[1368.40 → 1380.40] Jesus, now, whatever is mine.
[1380.40 → 1386.22] Oh, the chains are released, I can see.
[1386.22 → 1393.22] I am free, if not I, but through Christ in me.
[1393.22 → 1395.22] Oh, the chains are released, I am free, if not I, but through Christ.
[1395.22 → 1396.22] O Lord, my sin has been defeated.
[1396.22 → 1398.22] I am free, if not I, but through Christ.
[1398.22 → 1400.22] I am free, if not I, but through Christ in me.
[1400.22 → 1403.22] I am free, if not I, but through Christ in me.
[1403.22 → 1408.22] With every prayer, I long to follow Jesus.
[1408.22 → 1414.22] For He has said that He will bring me home.
[1414.22 → 1421.22] And one day, I know He will renew me.
[1421.22 → 1427.22] Until I stand, in joy for the love.
[1427.22 → 1433.22] He is my hope, my hope is only Jesus.
[1433.22 → 1439.22] All glory evermore to me.
[1439.22 → 1446.22] When my grace is complete, till my name shall repeat,
[1446.22 → 1452.22] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1452.22 → 1458.22] When my grace is complete, till my name shall repeat,
[1458.22 → 1465.22] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1465.22 → 1467.22] When my grace is complete,
[1467.22 → 1478.22] Then not I, but through Christ in me.
[1478.22 → 1499.30] So, good morning to you all.
[1499.30 → 1508.88] Before we get started, I want to embarrass my friend.
[1509.96 → 1515.60] Mike Hsu is a pastor in Vancouver, and he's on sabbatical, so he let me know he's going
[1515.60 → 1516.52] to be coming to join us.
[1516.66 → 1521.42] So, we have a visiting rabbi yet again this Sunday with us.
[1523.94 → 1528.34] So, as many of you will know, just over the last several months, we have been in a sermon
[1528.34 → 1529.56] series in the book of Acts.
[1531.12 → 1534.84] But today, we're actually going to leave Acts, set Acts aside.
[1534.96 → 1536.46] We had made it up to chapter 17.
[1537.44 → 1541.20] And today, we're going to begin a new series for the season of Advent.
[1541.46 → 1546.34] Now, some of those of you who are more familiar with the church calendar will be wondering,
[1546.52 → 1548.32] well, it's actually not Advent yet.
[1548.52 → 1548.92] I know.
[1549.46 → 1552.12] It's next week is the official start of Advent.
[1552.56 → 1556.20] Today is the last Sunday in the church calendar, Christ the King Sunday.
[1556.20 → 1561.26] But we're starting early because I have a longer series, and we have to fit it in.
[1563.08 → 1568.28] So, we'll begin this week on that and next week, you know, we'll have our candle lightings
[1568.28 → 1568.74] and all that.
[1570.62 → 1576.76] Now, I'm sure many of you will know or have read or have seen the movie of the Chronicles
[1576.76 → 1577.22] of Narnia.
[1577.22 → 1585.80] And you'll remember it starts when four children find a secret world called Narnia in the back
[1585.80 → 1587.62] of a wardrobe, right, in a closet.
[1588.84 → 1593.92] And the first thing that anybody notices about Narnia is that it's winter.
[1593.92 → 1600.18] And that's surprising to the children because where they live, it's actually late summer.
[1600.80 → 1607.16] But once they step into Narnia, one of the first things they hear is the sound of snow
[1607.16 → 1607.86] underfoot.
[1609.20 → 1614.32] And at first, the winter adds to the fantasy of Narnia.
[1614.40 → 1617.66] And as a reader, you're imagining this beautiful place.
[1617.66 → 1623.30] There's a lamppost in the middle of the forest, snow covering the trees and the ground, and
[1623.30 → 1625.00] there's tea with Mr. Tum nus.
[1625.10 → 1625.94] It's magical.
[1627.00 → 1630.10] But we soon learn that the snow is actually not a good thing.
[1631.16 → 1635.24] It's not just that it's winter, but it's a deep winter.
[1635.92 → 1643.92] It's a winter that has lasted for over 100 years because of the wicked witch and her rule.
[1643.92 → 1648.88] And so it's not even then just a deep winter.
[1649.10 → 1655.50] Narnia is actually described as being always winter, but never what?
[1656.52 → 1658.26] Never Christmas, right?
[1658.38 → 1661.32] Always winter, but never Christmas.
[1662.34 → 1666.50] And C.S. Lewis, you know, he knows how to grab the attention of a child, you know, reading
[1666.50 → 1671.04] along, and then as a kid, you hear that, and that is the worst thing you could ever hear.
[1671.04 → 1675.04] Always winter, but never Christmas.
[1675.20 → 1675.84] That's awful.
[1677.16 → 1680.04] But that is actually, it's a good description of the season of Advent.
[1681.30 → 1683.10] Always winter, but never Christmas.
[1684.20 → 1689.32] Advent is the first season of the Christian calendar, and it is a season of waiting.
[1690.74 → 1697.80] It's a season to prepare our hearts for the celebration of Christmas, for when Jesus Christ
[1697.80 → 1700.56] finally does come.
[1700.88 → 1702.18] That's what Advent is for.
[1703.28 → 1705.52] And so Advent is actually a season of fasting.
[1707.42 → 1713.00] And in some sense, when we remember, what we're doing is we're remembering what it was like
[1713.00 → 1714.30] before Jesus.
[1714.58 → 1719.24] Remembering what it was like before Christmas, when we were waiting, and it felt like it was
[1719.24 → 1720.68] always winter and never Christmas.
[1720.68 → 1728.26] And that makes the feast, though, all the better, because our hearts are prepared.
[1729.30 → 1735.04] And therefore, with these hearts prepared, we will be as excited and as joyful as children
[1735.04 → 1737.66] on Christmas when Jesus finally does come.
[1738.02 → 1745.34] So I want to invite us over these coming weeks to prepare our hearts, to experience, you know,
[1745.34 → 1751.14] not knowing all that we know now on this side of Jesus' coming, and all that he has brought
[1751.14 → 1757.22] into the world, but to put ourselves in the shoes of those people of Israel who are waiting
[1757.22 → 1757.94] for the Messiah.
[1762.02 → 1766.16] And so the way we're going to do this, the way we are going to prepare our hearts in this
[1766.16 → 1771.36] season is by way of a sermon series that's based on the O antiphons.
[1771.36 → 1777.70] Now, Jake kind of introduced that a bit already, and antiphon is a sung prayer.
[1778.56 → 1783.64] And in the early centuries of the church, Christians would sing these seven great prayers during
[1783.64 → 1785.38] the seven days before Christmas.
[1786.20 → 1789.82] And they were prayers for Christ to come.
[1790.46 → 1795.74] But they were prayers addressing Jesus, not by the name that we normally call him, Jesus,
[1795.74 → 1803.92] but actually by these mysterious messianic titles that are given to him in the book of Isaiah.
[1804.98 → 1811.50] And so Emmanuel, our good friend, and I don't see him today, so that's too bad.
[1811.58 → 1813.64] He didn't come on the day when we unveiled his art.
[1814.02 → 1817.76] So he did this calligraphy all around.
[1817.86 → 1820.16] So you can see what he's done.
[1820.28 → 1823.04] And each one of these is one of these messianic names.
[1823.04 → 1825.32] So some of them are behind you, and that's kind of my fault.
[1825.58 → 1826.24] That was my idea.
[1826.74 → 1830.32] But it starts here, wisdom.
[1830.96 → 1831.98] Oh, wisdom, come.
[1832.44 → 1833.64] Oh, Lord, come.
[1833.82 → 1835.38] Oh, root of Jesse, come.
[1836.44 → 1838.28] Over there, a key of David, come.
[1838.48 → 1841.10] Oh, day spring, king of nations.
[1842.26 → 1844.32] God with us, Emmanuel.
[1844.32 → 1852.24] And you may already be familiar with some of these because one of our most beloved Advent hymns,
[1852.34 → 1856.94] O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, is based on these O Antiphons.
[1857.60 → 1861.66] And the hymn has seven verses, and each one is based on one of these prayers.
[1862.28 → 1864.16] And they are beautiful prayers.
[1864.88 → 1871.52] And we will say them together each week because each of the prayers touches on one of our deepest needs.
[1871.52 → 1882.12] You know, the human predicament, us being, you know, caught in our sin, it calls for a particular kind of Saviour.
[1882.92 → 1889.62] And the O Antiphons help us to look to Jesus as the Saviour that we most truly need.
[1890.64 → 1892.24] And so that's what we're up to in this series.
[1892.62 → 1899.24] And today we will begin with the first Antiphon addressing Jesus as wisdom.
[1899.24 → 1902.18] O wisdom, come.
[1902.66 → 1905.94] And so first we'll read the Antiphon, the prayer, together.
[1906.14 → 1908.10] We're not going to sing it, but we'll read it.
[1908.68 → 1914.74] And after the sermon we will actually sing, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and we'll sing each verse throughout the weeks.
[1915.32 → 1922.14] So we'll read the Antiphon, and then we will read our scripture passage for today, just a few verses from Isaiah chapter 11.
[1922.78 → 1923.66] And then we'll begin.
[1923.66 → 1925.68] Okay, so let's read this out loud together.
[1927.08 → 1942.44] O wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all things, come and teach us the way of prudence.
[1942.44 → 1949.04] And so just a short reading for today from Isaiah chapter 11.
[1950.10 → 1955.96] So we'll read verse 2 and 3, and then jump ahead to chapter 28, verse 29.
[1956.50 → 1958.46] And here it is.
[1958.46 → 1981.80] Then in Isaiah chapter 28, verse 29.
[1981.80 → 1995.68] Would you please pray with me as we come before God's word?
[1995.68 → 2002.96] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[2004.04 → 2014.78] And Father, we pray that you would come and that you would bring a spirit of wisdom now as we come before you, come before your word.
[2015.98 → 2024.58] And Father, we ask that you would meet us where we are, that you would meet us in our need, and that you would sweetly order our hearts this morning.
[2024.58 → 2028.12] We pray in Christ's name and for his glory.
[2028.68 → 2029.04] Amen.
[2030.50 → 2036.28] And so we're looking at these titles of Christ from the book of Isaiah.
[2036.72 → 2041.10] So just to give you a bit of context to the book of Isaiah as a whole.
[2042.40 → 2047.42] Isaiah was a man who lived in Jerusalem in the latter half of Israel's kingdom period.
[2047.42 → 2054.96] And he was a prophet, which means that he spoke on God's behalf to God's people.
[2055.94 → 2060.52] And his message from God was, first, a message of judgment.
[2061.46 → 2069.14] He warned Israel's corrupt leaders that their rebellion against their covenant with God would actually come at a cost,
[2069.18 → 2071.02] that God would hold them accountable.
[2071.02 → 2077.08] That God was going to use the great empires of Assyria, then Babylon, to judge Jerusalem,
[2077.08 → 2082.72] if they persisted in their idolatry and of their oppression of the poor.
[2084.00 → 2089.94] So there's a message of judgment in the book of Isaiah, but there's also a message of hope.
[2089.94 → 2101.24] Because Isaiah told the people that God would one day keep his promise to send an anointed king from David's line to establish God's kingdom.
[2104.24 → 2105.40] I hear it popping.
[2109.72 → 2110.50] It's that.
[2110.62 → 2111.52] It's the monitor.
[2111.52 → 2117.70] Well, anyway, so the anointed king is going to come.
[2117.78 → 2118.36] That's the hope.
[2118.84 → 2121.30] And that's actually what Christ means.
[2122.10 → 2122.26] Right?
[2122.48 → 2124.20] Christ is not Jesus' last name.
[2124.46 → 2125.12] You know that, right?
[2125.18 → 2127.12] It means anointed one.
[2128.06 → 2129.04] Or Messiah.
[2129.24 → 2134.72] And so Messiah, this coming king, he would be the answer in the hope of the deepest needs of God's people.
[2134.72 → 2144.24] And so Isaiah 11, in our passage this morning, it promises a saviour for Israel who will be anointed with a spirit of wisdom.
[2145.06 → 2145.22] Okay?
[2145.26 → 2146.04] A spirit of wisdom.
[2146.40 → 2149.42] Now, that sounds nice to everybody, doesn't it?
[2149.76 → 2155.38] Like, that we would have a ruler who would be wise.
[2155.50 → 2157.90] So we all hear that, and we say, well, that would be great.
[2158.34 → 2161.12] We all want someone in charge who's marked by wisdom.
[2161.76 → 2162.14] Right?
[2162.14 → 2171.08] Isn't that what we hope for, whether we elect our political leaders or, you know, someone who, our boss who's running the business, or whether it's a teacher.
[2171.22 → 2175.10] You know, we want people who lead us to be wise.
[2175.22 → 2175.36] Right?
[2175.38 → 2176.74] We don't want to be run by fools.
[2178.76 → 2179.96] So we agree with that.
[2180.00 → 2190.48] But for the sake of Advent and putting ourselves in the shoes of Israel, we need to really try to grasp just how desperate Israel is for this kind of saviour.
[2190.48 → 2198.18] And to understand this particular need, we need to remember the story of the Bible.
[2199.18 → 2212.98] And one thing that the Bible teaches us is that wisdom, before it can describe us, or before we say we don't have it, and we need it, it's actually an attribute of who God is.
[2212.98 → 2224.70] And the apostle Paul calls God, the only wise God.
[2225.56 → 2226.20] Right?
[2226.26 → 2233.30] And because a wise God created the world, everything he made was made by wisdom.
[2234.26 → 2234.48] Right?
[2234.58 → 2238.78] Wisdom is woven into the fabric of the whole creation.
[2238.78 → 2242.30] It's woven into the fabric of this universe that we live in.
[2243.72 → 2245.40] So here's a verse.
[2245.56 → 2248.10] Psalm 104, 24 says this.
[2248.36 → 2250.32] How many are your works, Lord?
[2251.30 → 2253.74] In wisdom you made them all.
[2255.18 → 2261.42] Then we read in the book of Proverbs, wisdom is personified as a woman crying out at the gates of a city,
[2261.94 → 2264.14] calling for people to hear her voice.
[2264.14 → 2267.76] And so wisdom says in Proverbs 8,
[2268.24 → 2274.86] The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old.
[2275.14 → 2280.92] I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
[2281.68 → 2284.40] and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
[2284.40 → 2287.58] Then I was constantly at his side.
[2288.16 → 2295.72] I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, rejoicing in his whole world,
[2296.02 → 2297.76] and delighting in mankind.
[2299.68 → 2300.22] Right?
[2300.30 → 2305.44] So the scriptures teach us that the universe was made by wisdom and through wisdom.
[2305.44 → 2312.02] And so the world that we live in is not just an accident of time, you know, plus chance, plus matter.
[2312.20 → 2313.10] It is ordered.
[2313.38 → 2314.28] It is wise.
[2314.42 → 2315.16] It is good.
[2315.64 → 2316.88] This world that God has made.
[2317.88 → 2321.84] And that actually, as we think about it, makes sense of our experience in this world.
[2322.44 → 2327.80] Because the world is made by a wise God, there is order in nature.
[2327.96 → 2329.46] There's order in God's creation.
[2329.46 → 2337.26] And so if you think of even like the smallest cell of a plant or an animal, it is intricately complex.
[2338.00 → 2340.06] And yet, it is ordered.
[2340.66 → 2342.32] It functions the way God intends.
[2342.40 → 2343.20] It makes sense.
[2343.96 → 2350.06] And so, a biologist can study cells and learn about the mechanisms of life.
[2350.88 → 2356.28] You know, a mathematician can represent the order that is found in the world with equations.
[2356.28 → 2366.72] Or a physicist can determine, you know, the workings of the smallest atom or the biggest galaxy because the world is made in wisdom.
[2367.94 → 2371.60] And then when God made us, he made us in his image.
[2371.74 → 2376.06] And any wisdom that we have as human beings is derived from God.
[2377.70 → 2380.44] And then if you remember the story of Genesis, right?
[2380.50 → 2383.12] God made Adam and Eve, and he put them in the garden.
[2383.46 → 2384.50] And what did he say to them?
[2384.50 → 2389.88] You may eat of the fruit of any tree in the garden except for one tree.
[2390.22 → 2390.68] Which tree?
[2391.80 → 2395.02] The tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2396.22 → 2404.08] But the crafty and deceitful serpent represents God as saying the very opposite.
[2405.44 → 2408.08] You shall not eat of any tree in the garden.
[2409.68 → 2412.26] And so doubt crept in.
[2412.26 → 2415.54] And Adam and Eve, they began to doubt God's wisdom.
[2416.44 → 2420.60] Is God really for us after all?
[2421.72 → 2421.86] Right?
[2421.92 → 2424.10] Is he for us in his commandments?
[2425.20 → 2427.94] And the temptation is to answer no.
[2428.82 → 2430.66] The temptation is to doubt God.
[2430.84 → 2434.50] It's to doubt not to trust God's wisdom.
[2434.50 → 2437.96] And instead to seek that wisdom for ourselves.
[2439.28 → 2445.50] And so even though as image bearers, Adam and Eve are truly like God in many ways.
[2445.50 → 2452.90] They still, they cannot resist the temptation to become like God in knowing good and evil.
[2453.10 → 2457.22] That is, in becoming wise on their own terms.
[2457.34 → 2459.02] Independent of God's wisdom.
[2459.92 → 2461.92] So they rebelled against God's wisdom.
[2462.50 → 2465.92] They ate the fruit of the tree that God told them not to eat.
[2465.92 → 2470.20] And as a result, they were separated from the God of wisdom.
[2470.70 → 2474.34] We lost wisdom, and we became fools.
[2475.10 → 2476.56] That is the human predicament.
[2477.58 → 2484.22] And it's this foolishness that God takes his people to task over in the book of Isaiah.
[2485.20 → 2485.68] Right?
[2485.78 → 2487.96] God's word to his people, this word of judgment,
[2487.96 → 2494.40] in the opening verses of Isaiah, is one of deep sadness and utter disgust.
[2495.22 → 2496.60] So listen to what God says.
[2496.66 → 2499.96] If you have your Bibles open, you can turn to chapter 1.
[2500.72 → 2501.78] But we'll have it on the screen.
[2501.96 → 2506.06] So Isaiah chapter 1, it opens with these words.
[2506.16 → 2507.34] Starting right in verse 2.
[2508.34 → 2509.90] Hear me, you heavens.
[2510.12 → 2510.86] Listen, earth.
[2510.92 → 2512.10] For the Lord has spoken.
[2512.10 → 2515.10] I've reared children and brought them up.
[2515.22 → 2517.48] But they have rebelled against me.
[2518.50 → 2520.18] The ox knows its master.
[2520.82 → 2522.44] The donkey its owner's manger.
[2522.68 → 2524.00] But Israel does not know.
[2524.28 → 2526.74] My people do not understand.
[2529.16 → 2532.62] God says, my sons and daughters, right?
[2532.66 → 2534.72] The ones whom I have redeemed out of Egypt.
[2535.04 → 2537.60] The ones whom I have given my law at Mount Sinai.
[2537.70 → 2539.10] And I planted them in the land.
[2539.26 → 2540.54] And I have given them everything.
[2540.54 → 2542.74] They are dumber than an ox.
[2543.14 → 2546.32] They are more stubborn than a donkey.
[2546.32 → 2548.64] Wow.
[2548.64 → 2549.32] Right?
[2550.64 → 2551.24] God.
[2551.88 → 2556.14] Why is he saying such things about his people?
[2556.94 → 2557.14] Right?
[2557.22 → 2558.86] What is God so angry about?
[2560.00 → 2562.50] Well, God, through Isaiah, he goes on.
[2562.80 → 2568.82] And he points out in the opening chapter so many issues that he has with his people.
[2568.82 → 2572.30] But really, you can boil it down essentially to two things.
[2572.50 → 2576.60] That they have completely failed in loving God and in loving their neighbours.
[2577.60 → 2580.74] So, for instance, verse 4 goes on.
[2580.74 → 2582.66] Woe to the sinful nation.
[2583.14 → 2585.26] A people whose guilt is great.
[2585.70 → 2589.08] A brood of evildoers.
[2589.62 → 2591.28] Children given to corruption.
[2592.00 → 2593.46] They have forsaken the Lord.
[2593.56 → 2595.40] They have spurned the Holy One of Israel.
[2595.92 → 2598.56] And turned their backs on him.
[2598.56 → 2604.80] Then, down in verse 15, it says this.
[2605.38 → 2608.32] Your hands are full of blood.
[2609.36 → 2611.68] Take your evil deeds out of my sight.
[2612.22 → 2613.56] Stop doing wrong.
[2613.96 → 2614.84] Learn to do right.
[2615.10 → 2615.80] Seek justice.
[2615.98 → 2616.92] Defend the oppressed.
[2617.48 → 2619.18] Take up the cause of the fatherless.
[2619.52 → 2621.66] Plead the case of the widow.
[2621.66 → 2632.86] And so, notice that biblical wisdom, it has to do with rightly worshipping God and living a life of righteousness and justice.
[2633.48 → 2635.68] That's what wisdom is.
[2636.30 → 2636.44] Right?
[2636.56 → 2639.18] And so, it's not know-how.
[2639.74 → 2639.88] Right?
[2639.90 → 2641.74] It's not just having information.
[2642.84 → 2644.22] So, knowledge, right?
[2644.26 → 2646.72] And the word knowledge in Latin is sciential.
[2647.52 → 2650.08] That's where we get a word science from the Latin.
[2650.08 → 2655.38] And one of the main ways that we gain information about this world that God has made is through science.
[2655.74 → 2656.46] And that is good.
[2656.54 → 2657.72] We can learn about the world.
[2658.56 → 2661.60] But wisdom, sapiential, the Latin.
[2661.78 → 2664.54] I'm not a Latin scholar, but that's what I've learned.
[2666.00 → 2666.80] That's different.
[2668.18 → 2673.00] Wisdom is knowing how to use that knowledge to act toward the right end.
[2674.30 → 2677.40] And this distinction between knowledge and wisdom is important.
[2677.40 → 2684.62] Because if we don't know this, when we're going to search for a Messiah, we are going to search for the wrong one.
[2686.20 → 2686.32] Right?
[2686.40 → 2697.20] If we're going to look, if what we need is more knowledge, well, what we're going to look for is science and technology to solve our deepest problems.
[2697.20 → 2701.72] Or we're going to search for someone who understands politics or economics.
[2702.48 → 2702.92] Right?
[2702.98 → 2705.00] These are the people that we often look to.
[2705.64 → 2706.12] Experts.
[2706.72 → 2709.06] Because that's what we think the world needs.
[2710.00 → 2717.08] But, friends, more knowledge, more technology, it can't tell us how to live rightly in the world that God has made.
[2717.08 → 2717.38] Right?
[2718.62 → 2722.60] It can't tell us technology, you know, maybe better AI or whatever it is.
[2722.62 → 2727.18] It's not going to tell us and teach us how to worship God.
[2727.84 → 2734.48] And it is not going to change our hearts so that we would love our neighbours and that we would care for the oppressed.
[2735.42 → 2739.10] More knowledge is not going to solve our problems.
[2739.10 → 2750.80] You know, in Isaiah, he was prophesying at a time when he's looking around at the world, and he saw God's people given over to idolatry and injustice and all sorts of evil.
[2752.22 → 2758.46] And in these verses from Isaiah that we read, Isaiah tells us we need God's wisdom.
[2760.06 → 2763.04] But that doesn't mean we just need to be taught the law better.
[2763.94 → 2764.36] Right?
[2764.42 → 2768.34] Like we didn't quite get it the first time, and so we need to be taught again.
[2769.10 → 2770.42] I mean, that certainly would help.
[2771.14 → 2779.56] But no, the fundamental problem is our sinful human condition that we are, that we have lost wisdom, that we are trapped in a cycle of foolishness.
[2779.66 → 2782.90] We don't know and worship God rightly, and we do injustice.
[2784.10 → 2788.14] And that's why we need a wise hero to save us.
[2789.36 → 2794.34] And so Isaiah not only preaches this word of judgment but also word of hope.
[2794.34 → 2804.98] So in Isaiah, now coming into chapter 11, our passage for today, verses 2 and 3, Isaiah, he tells us about the Messiah that God will send.
[2806.02 → 2807.08] And this is what he says.
[2807.44 → 2813.96] The spirit of the Lord will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
[2814.48 → 2816.56] The spirit of counsel and might.
[2817.06 → 2821.74] The spirit of the knowledge and the fear of the Lord, and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.
[2821.74 → 2822.74] Right?
[2823.56 → 2825.74] Friends, that is the kind of king that we need.
[2826.82 → 2830.66] We need a wise king who can lead us in the ways of God.
[2830.94 → 2832.20] In the ways of righteousness.
[2833.02 → 2835.36] A king who will fear the Lord.
[2837.36 → 2840.88] And almost a thousand years later, Isaiah's vision comes true.
[2841.64 → 2841.88] Right?
[2841.88 → 2843.14] The word of God, right?
[2843.22 → 2847.90] Through whom all things were made in wisdom, came into our world.
[2848.42 → 2856.96] Not only personified as wisdom as a poetic metaphor, but literally became a man.
[2857.68 → 2862.58] So the apostle John writes, you know, these very familiar words in the opening of John's gospel.
[2863.58 → 2864.00] He says,
[2864.00 → 2865.00] Right?
[2865.00 → 2880.66] And so Jesus Christ, the eternal son of God, the eternal word, became a man.
[2880.66 → 2888.52] And then those who saw Jesus' life, who witnessed his life, they saw not only a wise teacher,
[2889.22 → 2893.06] but they have seen, they saw something that they have never seen before.
[2893.62 → 2902.90] They heard something that they have never heard before because they saw the actual wisdom of God himself as a person.
[2902.90 → 2906.36] And so Jesus, he comes, he teaches, right?
[2906.42 → 2911.92] And in the famous Sermon on the Mount, after he preaches that, Matthew tells us this.
[2912.70 → 2918.40] When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
[2919.26 → 2925.26] Because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law.
[2925.26 → 2934.00] Then when he returns to Nazareth, his hometown, in Mark chapter 6, Mark writes this.
[2934.88 → 2937.52] When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue.
[2938.62 → 2941.44] And many who heard him were amazed.
[2941.64 → 2944.32] Where did this man get these things, they asked?
[2944.68 → 2948.84] What's this wisdom that has been given to him?
[2950.48 → 2950.70] Right?
[2950.74 → 2952.16] So the people are hearing Jesus.
[2952.40 → 2953.86] They're asking all this kind of questions.
[2953.86 → 2954.82] Who is this guy?
[2954.82 → 2957.04] What is this wisdom that he's speaking?
[2958.52 → 2964.22] Because Jesus, in a way that no one has ever seen before, embodied the wisdom of God.
[2964.70 → 2966.40] In the way he loved others.
[2966.54 → 2967.58] In the way he taught.
[2968.08 → 2969.60] In the way he related to people.
[2970.46 → 2972.12] In the way he related to God.
[2973.98 → 2975.98] And then Jesus even said about himself.
[2976.88 → 2980.28] These things, this, in Matthew chapter 12, verse 42.
[2980.28 → 2985.30] The queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it.
[2985.68 → 2989.14] For she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom.
[2989.14 → 2994.78] And now something greater than Solomon is here.
[2994.78 → 2995.14] Right?
[2995.14 → 2997.74] Jesus is talking about himself.
[2997.74 → 3002.26] And he says, I am greater than the wisdom of Solomon.
[3002.90 → 3003.08] Right?
[3003.12 → 3005.40] The Solomon who wrote Proverbs.
[3006.46 → 3007.72] The book of wisdom.
[3008.52 → 3011.26] Greater than Solomon who wrote Ecclesiastes.
[3011.26 → 3017.32] Who was the wisest king that Israel ever had.
[3017.58 → 3019.30] Jesus said, I am wiser than I.
[3020.84 → 3021.22] Right?
[3021.32 → 3023.66] Jesus comes to us as the wisdom of God.
[3024.32 → 3027.24] He comes to us as the way and the truth and the life.
[3027.24 → 3034.04] But when he came as our saviour, he didn't save us according to the world's wisdom.
[3034.88 → 3035.22] Right?
[3035.28 → 3037.70] He came as the long-awaited king.
[3037.92 → 3039.72] But not in power and might.
[3039.84 → 3040.64] Not in dominance.
[3041.52 → 3045.98] He saved us through the most foolish means, humanly speaking.
[3047.48 → 3048.00] Right?
[3048.08 → 3051.46] Because just as he's beginning to get up this political momentum.
[3051.66 → 3053.28] A crowd is starting to follow him.
[3053.68 → 3054.32] What does he do?
[3054.32 → 3061.84] He accomplishes our salvation by getting himself crucified between two thieves.
[3063.28 → 3065.24] What kind of wisdom is that?
[3066.48 → 3068.24] Who would have thought of that?
[3069.44 → 3072.60] And the answer is, it's not any kind of human wisdom.
[3072.74 → 3073.90] It is the wisdom of God.
[3075.80 → 3081.02] We learn about this from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 1, verse 18.
[3081.02 → 3086.62] For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing.
[3087.44 → 3091.10] But to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[3091.90 → 3092.22] Right?
[3092.28 → 3096.24] The gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ is foolishness to the world.
[3097.04 → 3102.80] And yet at the same time, mysteriously, it is the wisdom of God, the saving wisdom of God.
[3102.80 → 3110.84] So then Paul continues in 1 Corinthians 1 with this kind of couple verses, a longer passage.
[3111.04 → 3115.36] But it's so amazing about comparing the wisdom of man and the wisdom of God.
[3116.32 → 3117.10] Paul writes,
[3117.10 → 3137.22] Jews demanded signs and Greeks looked for wisdom.
[3137.22 → 3143.84] But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.
[3144.28 → 3151.38] But to those whom God has called both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and what?
[3152.22 → 3154.40] The wisdom of God.
[3155.86 → 3160.16] For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom.
[3160.68 → 3164.66] And the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
[3164.66 → 3169.08] Friends, this is our hope in this season of Advent.
[3170.58 → 3173.92] Our hope is not new and better technology.
[3174.82 → 3177.60] It's not a change in political administration.
[3178.06 → 3179.50] It's not a new job.
[3179.82 → 3181.04] It's not a new relationship.
[3181.36 → 3182.70] It's not a raise.
[3183.50 → 3190.68] It is Christ Jesus, who is himself wisdom and who loves you in his wisdom.
[3191.24 → 3192.90] And has given himself to you.
[3192.90 → 3195.96] Friends, that is the wisdom that we need.
[3196.90 → 3203.04] And that's the wisdom that is available to us as God's people through faith in him every day as we put our trust in him.
[3203.74 → 3208.46] And then God gives us his Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom of God.
[3208.54 → 3214.06] This wisdom that we lack, but that has been fulfilled in Christ and given to us as his church.
[3214.72 → 3215.82] So this is what Paul says.
[3215.88 → 3218.28] I love this, what he says here in Colossians.
[3218.76 → 3220.52] This is our last passage I'll share with you.
[3220.52 → 3222.52] Paul says,
[3222.52 → 3230.68] We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives.
[3231.38 → 3237.60] So that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way.
[3238.68 → 3241.88] Bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God.
[3241.88 → 3244.56] Friends, we can have the wisdom of God.
[3246.46 → 3249.40] So as we end here, let me just ask you this question.
[3251.02 → 3255.50] Where do you need the wisdom of the Lord in your life?
[3255.50 → 3263.30] What mess needs to be disentangled in your life?
[3264.76 → 3272.76] What sin, what broken relationship are you at a complete loss to know how to deal with?
[3272.76 → 3279.40] Or what loved one suffers in a way that's too complicated for you to unravel?
[3280.60 → 3286.10] What are the places in your life where there is a deep sadness and a deep pain, and you don't know what to do?
[3288.28 → 3289.84] Friends, Jesus knows.
[3291.12 → 3294.22] He is wisdom itself.
[3294.22 → 3296.44] And so we can cry out to him.
[3296.52 → 3298.06] We can say, Oh wisdom, come.
[3299.30 → 3301.42] Sweetly order my life.
[3302.12 → 3304.04] Sweetly order my home.
[3305.00 → 3306.54] Sweetly order this whole world.
[3308.00 → 3309.12] And he is wise.
[3309.36 → 3310.42] And he can do it.
[3310.54 → 3311.86] And he has come to do this.
[3313.00 → 3315.16] The question though for each of us is,
[3315.50 → 3316.74] Will I follow him?
[3317.78 → 3318.00] Right?
[3318.06 → 3320.96] Do I agree with God in his judgment of the world?
[3320.96 → 3325.28] And then do I agree with him in his Saviour?
[3326.10 → 3327.86] The Saviour that he sends.
[3327.96 → 3330.20] Because he is the Saviour that we need.
[3330.74 → 3332.32] And then we need to say, Yes, Jesus.
[3332.78 → 3333.98] You are wise.
[3334.70 → 3336.06] I will follow you.
[3336.14 → 3337.16] I will trust you.
[3337.24 → 3339.18] I'm not going to seek my own wisdom.
[3340.14 → 3341.46] In my foolishness.
[3341.54 → 3343.18] Well, I am going to seek the wisdom of God.
[3343.26 → 3345.16] I'm going to seek Jesus Christ himself.
[3345.32 → 3346.44] And I will wait on him.
[3346.44 → 3351.24] And so in the Chronicles of Narnia,
[3351.46 → 3352.38] you know, those four children,
[3352.52 → 3353.28] they're in Narnia,
[3353.66 → 3355.26] where it's always winter and never Christmas.
[3356.62 → 3358.34] But finally in this story,
[3358.82 → 3361.14] to the joy of children everywhere who read the book,
[3361.36 → 3362.56] they meet Father Christmas.
[3363.96 → 3367.36] The white witch has been keeping him out of Narnia.
[3368.20 → 3369.58] But Father Christmas says,
[3369.70 → 3370.86] I've come at last.
[3371.70 → 3373.68] King Aslan is on the move.
[3373.68 → 3376.78] The witch's magic is weakening.
[3378.00 → 3379.40] Then as we all might hope,
[3379.50 → 3380.98] he hands out gifts to everyone.
[3382.00 → 3384.48] And then he's off to deliver more Christmas cheer.
[3384.80 → 3386.70] And he turns before he goes,
[3386.86 → 3388.54] and he proclaims,
[3388.90 → 3389.96] Merry Christmas.
[3390.44 → 3392.54] Long live the true King.
[3395.22 → 3396.56] Long live the true King.
[3397.06 → 3398.24] The Lord Jesus Christ.
[3398.98 → 3399.90] Let's pray together.
[3399.90 → 3403.94] Heavenly Father,
[3404.12 → 3404.64] we are,
[3405.66 → 3407.24] in our foolishness,
[3407.32 → 3408.82] we are baffled by your grace.
[3409.96 → 3412.14] How unsearchable are your ways.
[3412.90 → 3414.02] That in your wisdom,
[3414.16 → 3416.60] you became for us wisdom from on high.
[3417.48 → 3418.60] And in your wisdom,
[3418.72 → 3420.06] you accomplished our salvation.
[3420.88 → 3422.78] And the salvation of all those who trust you.
[3423.02 → 3423.20] Father,
[3423.32 → 3424.10] would you send
[3424.10 → 3426.30] a spirit of wisdom
[3426.30 → 3428.10] to us.
[3429.56 → 3432.34] Wisdom that is full of grace and truth.
[3433.52 → 3436.80] That we would know how to live according to your wisdom.
[3437.50 → 3437.78] And Father,
[3437.84 → 3439.64] we look forward to the day of your return
[3439.64 → 3440.28] when as King,
[3440.40 → 3442.08] you will rule over all things.
[3442.24 → 3444.22] With equity and with justice forever.
[3445.38 → 3445.86] Father,
[3445.94 → 3447.08] we look forward to that day
[3447.08 → 3447.82] and we say,
[3448.38 → 3448.74] come,
[3449.54 → 3450.34] oh wisdom,
[3450.50 → 3450.70] come.
[3450.70 → 3454.62] We pray these things in Christ's name.
[3455.36 → 3455.70] Amen.
[3458.06 → 3459.06] Let's rise.
[3459.48 → 3461.40] And Paul will give us some instruction
[3461.40 → 3462.62] as we sing,
[3462.74 → 3462.88] O come,
[3462.92 → 3463.12] O come,
[3463.20 → 3463.42] Emmanuel.
[3463.52 → 3464.00] Let's stand.
[3467.00 → 3469.92] Today we're going to sing just one verse.
[3470.60 → 3471.32] The initial,
[3471.84 → 3472.88] O wisdom,
[3473.08 → 3473.28] come.
[3473.52 → 3478.80] Which is not normally in the first position in the hymn.
[3478.80 → 3480.78] But it will be for today.
[3480.90 → 3483.96] And each Sunday of the sermon series,
[3484.06 → 3488.28] we will add that verse that will be the focus of that message.
[3488.82 → 3495.04] So today we'll start, and I'll just play through an instrumental version of the melody.
[3495.58 → 3495.96] Again,
[3496.04 → 3498.72] this sense of anticipation of what was coming.
[3499.08 → 3501.28] They were waiting 400 years in silence,
[3501.56 → 3503.84] waiting to hear the fulfillment.
[3504.76 → 3506.52] I'll play through once just the melody.
[3506.52 → 3508.10] Then we'll hum together.
[3508.86 → 3510.72] Just the melody.
[3511.26 → 3512.54] And then we'll sing verse one.
[3513.10 → 3516.54] And that's how we'll treat the song today.
[3516.54 → 3517.74] That's how we'll read.
[3517.74 → 3547.72] Thank you.
[3547.74 → 3577.72] Thank you.
[3577.74 → 3607.72] Thank you.
[3607.74 → 3637.72] Thank you.
[3637.74 → 3639.74] Thank you.
[3667.74 → 3669.74] Thank you.
[3697.74 → 3699.74] Thank you.
[3699.74 → 3701.74] Thank you.
[3701.74 → 3703.74] Thank you.
[3731.74 → 3733.74] Thank you.
[3733.74 → 3735.74] Thank you.
[3735.74 → 3737.74] Thank you.
[3737.74 → 3739.74] Thank you.
[3767.74 → 3769.74] Thank you.
[3797.74 → 3799.74] Thank you.
[3827.74 → 3831.74] Thank you.
[3831.74 → 3859.42] Before we go to For God in Prayer this morning,
[3859.42 → 3865.42] there's just one update to the bulletin and that is that as of Friday,
[3865.42 → 3870.30] Allie Hack lander has been in hospice and at least humanly speaking,
[3870.30 → 3873.10] appears to be nearing the end of her time with us.
[3873.10 → 3875.82] So we definitely want to remember Allie, her family,
[3875.82 → 3878.86] in our prayers this morning and this week.
[3878.86 → 3880.86] Please join me in prayer.
[3883.74 → 3888.30] O great God, glorify yourself in all the earth.
[3888.30 → 3890.70] Be glorified in creation.
[3890.70 → 3893.10] Be glorified in your church.
[3893.10 → 3897.42] Be glorified in our worship here this very morning.
[3897.42 → 3900.94] Though we are so small, and you are so grand,
[3900.94 → 3904.54] help us nevertheless to magnify your name.
[3904.54 → 3911.02] Help us to make your name and the nature of your grace larger and easier for people to see.
[3911.02 → 3915.98] Help us to live and to worship in such a way that we become like magnifying glasses
[3915.98 → 3919.26] through which our neighbours and coworkers and children and friends
[3919.82 → 3923.74] can see you come into focus in ways they may not have seen before.
[3923.74 → 3927.18] Bless the leadership of our congregation.
[3927.18 → 3932.62] Anoint them by your spirit and may they feel, really feel that anointing.
[3932.62 → 3937.34] As they sometimes do difficult, sometimes joyful, but always holy work,
[3937.34 → 3939.58] may they sense your presence and your guidance.
[3941.58 → 3947.42] We give thanks and praise this morning for the births of Nathan and Noah to Lorna and Kenny McCrae
[3947.42 → 3951.82] and pray that Noah in particular will gain strength and weight quickly
[3951.82 → 3954.30] and be able to join his family at their home.
[3954.30 → 3958.06] Please bless this young family as they adjust to each other.
[3958.06 → 3965.02] We thank you, Lord, for the beauty of your creation, for the bright sunshine we've been enjoying
[3965.02 → 3966.54] in this normally dark time of the year.
[3967.10 → 3970.54] We thank you for this time that we can be together this morning in praise of you,
[3971.10 → 3973.50] exploring your word and seeking your intercession.
[3974.86 → 3979.74] We think of the needs of others at this time, O Lord, and we are embarrassed by our selfishness.
[3980.46 → 3984.70] May the answer to our prayers begin with us to redeem the times,
[3984.70 → 3991.90] bring to all those who are in need the alleviation of their poverty or comfort for their minds and spirits.
[3992.70 → 3998.70] Enable us to do what we can to help them to share our own happiness and prosperity,
[3998.70 → 4003.90] to provide a listening ear or friendly word, to do errands or acts of kindness.
[4005.18 → 4009.90] We pray also for those dear to us who are sick or troubled or unsure in their faith.
[4009.90 → 4016.54] In particular, we hold up before you this morning, Ali Hack lander, Ted van der Rest, and Ali Burma,
[4016.54 → 4025.42] who all face health issues and changes in living arrangements and, yes, even seemingly the end of this journey on earth with us.
[4026.54 → 4031.58] We pray for healing and peace for them and their families through these difficult days.
[4031.58 → 4038.22] We pray for Robin's sister, Judy, who's having a difficult time health-wise and difficult time speaking.
[4038.22 → 4043.10] We just pray for healing for her, that she is able to communicate better with Robin.
[4043.90 → 4047.66] And we pray for the world into which you came and which you still love.
[4048.46 → 4050.54] We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine.
[4051.34 → 4057.50] We pray for your wisdom and your spirit to work in the hearts of the leaders to find a path forward to end this conflict.
[4057.50 → 4064.14] We pray that the ceasefire in Gaza can be a window to a more lasting peace in Gaza and Israel,
[4064.54 → 4067.98] and that aid can be delivered where there is such desperate need.
[4069.50 → 4073.26] We pray for the Talking Bible Ministry and that through these efforts,
[4073.66 → 4078.78] many can come to hear and believe the wonderful, freeing news of the Gospel.
[4080.86 → 4082.86] Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.
[4082.86 → 4091.26] Help us to be effective servants to you, and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
[4092.30 → 4095.66] We thank you for hearing our prayers, Lord. Amen.

[4152.62 → 4157.40] that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[4157.40 → 4166.40] And may he work in us that which is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever.
