[1285.70 --> 1315.68]  Thank you, God,
[1315.68 --> 1345.66]  When I stand in the Lord,
[1345.66 --> 1375.64]  Thank you, Jesus,
[1375.64 --> 1393.48]  so today is our volunteer appreciation sunday and i was just kind of mindful that maybe we should
[1393.48 --> 1397.72]  have done this a bit earlier because i think a lot of people have started their summer breaks
[1397.72 --> 1403.16]  i know a lot of people are camping this weekend traveling doing different things but thank you
[1404.04 --> 1411.40]  all for being here who are here and so what i want to do is you know the church we're the body of christ
[1411.40 --> 1420.20]  and god through the holy spirit has equipped every single one of us to to serve one another right to
[1420.20 --> 1427.48]  be part of this body where each part of the body is is given for the building up of the body of christ
[1427.48 --> 1434.20]  and so in a church uh you know we have people who do all kinds of different things that help to serve
[1434.20 --> 1439.72]  one another to build one another up so what i want to do is i've made a list just now and i've tried to
[1439.72 --> 1444.52]  think of all the different ways people serve and i may have missed one but if i do you can yell it out
[1444.52 --> 1451.00]  to me but i'm just going to kind of go down this list and as you hear an area of ministry in which
[1451.00 --> 1458.28]  you have served in this year then i would ask you to stand and just remain standing and we'll just
[1458.28 --> 1463.56]  kind of read off everybody all these different areas and we'll just kind of you know recognize
[1463.56 --> 1474.44]  how we have served one another over this year okay so if you are an elder please stand okay deacons

[1604.44 --> 1610.20]  you may be seated um and after the service we will just celebrate together we will have some cake
[1610.76 --> 1617.40]  and to go with our coffee okay so at this time our children most of them are camping but some of our
[1617.40 --> 1631.48]  children the ones who are here may go to their sunday school classes okay and as they go we will turn
[1631.48 --> 1635.00]  our attention to the sermon for today
[1635.00 --> 1649.40]  okay so last week we began a new sermon series in the book of acts and that's the series is going
[1649.40 --> 1655.96]  to take us through the summer likely into the fall and we actually last week started in chapter 10
[1656.84 --> 1661.56]  and the reason we started in chapter 10 which is about a third of the way through is because we're
[1661.56 --> 1666.28]  picking back up in a previous sermon series that we did a few years ago where we've already covered
[1666.28 --> 1673.48]  chapters 1 through 9. so for those of of you who weren't with us last week i wanted to just remind us
[1674.36 --> 1681.56]  of the story of where we are in this narrative of what god is doing in the early church
[1683.08 --> 1689.72]  so jesus pretty well tells us what acts is all about right at the very beginning of the book in chapter
[1689.72 --> 1697.16]  1 verse 8. this is what jesus says to his disciples before he ascends into heaven and leaves them he
[1697.16 --> 1703.32]  says but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in
[1703.32 --> 1713.48]  jerusalem and all judea and samaria and then to the very ends of the earth and the book of acts is laid out
[1714.20 --> 1722.12]  pretty much in this way and so for the first seven chapters it focuses on the city of jerusalem and the
[1722.12 --> 1728.12]  birth and the growth of the church there but then at the end of chapter 7 there's a transition that
[1728.12 --> 1735.72]  happens a turning point because one of the deacons of the church in jerusalem stephen was killed for
[1735.72 --> 1744.12]  telling people about jesus christ faithfully and so we see the news about jesus will not always be
[1744.12 --> 1751.56]  welcome even when our words and our actions are motivated by love some people are going to feel
[1751.56 --> 1758.60]  threatened and angry because the message is that jesus is the only true son of god and that he is worthy
[1758.60 --> 1766.68]  of our worship and so persecution arises and we see that the gospel starts to bleed out of the city of
[1766.68 --> 1773.80]  jerusalem into the surrounding areas of judea and samaria so then in chapters 8 9 and 10 we start to see
[1773.80 --> 1780.76]  something new happen we start seeing that this is a gospel for everyone this is the gospel for the whole
[1780.76 --> 1787.80]  earth and we saw last week with peter who went to preach the gospel to cornelius in caesarea to
[1787.80 --> 1795.32]  cornelius's household in cornelius we saw was a gentile roman centurion and that brings us to
[1795.32 --> 1801.32]  our passage for today in chapter 11 and it's a beautiful text that tells us about the birth
[1802.28 --> 1809.48]  of a church for the very first time that had a significant representation of gentiles in the church
[1810.92 --> 1817.72]  so this is where in the book of acts the focus starts to shift from jerusalem and judea and samaria
[1818.20 --> 1824.20]  to the ends of the earth to reach all people so before we read our passage to help orient us
[1826.36 --> 1832.28]  so can we have a map we have a map here and you can see maybe i mean it's a very tall map but at the
[1832.28 --> 1838.36]  very bottom you see judea and samaria in that area and that's where the church started that's where most
[1838.36 --> 1848.52]  of the christians were but then it starts to spread upward and down into africa but also in this story
[1848.52 --> 1855.16]  it goes up into cyprus you see the island there cyprus and then up the coast phoenicia into syria and then
[1855.16 --> 1861.80]  the city that is the focus of chapter 11 is antioch and i've circled it in red so hopefully you see at the
[1861.80 --> 1868.92]  very top antioch and so that is where we are today and so i'm going to invite terry to come up and read
[1868.92 --> 1877.32]  our passage for us right now
[1877.32 --> 1894.60]  so i'll be reading acts 11 19 to 30. now those who had been scattered by the persecution that
[1894.60 --> 1902.60]  broke out when stephen was killed traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch spreading the word
[1902.60 --> 1910.68]  among jews some of them however men from cyprus and cyrene went to antioch to begin to speak to greeks
[1911.56 --> 1918.28]  also telling them of the good news about the lord jesus the lord's hand was with them and a great
[1918.28 --> 1925.24]  number of people believed and turned to the lord news of this reached the church in jerusalem and they
[1925.24 --> 1932.44]  sent barnabas to antioch when he arrived he saw that the grace of god had done he was
[1932.44 --> 1939.08]  glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the lord with all their hearts he was a good man full
[1939.08 --> 1945.56]  of the holy spirit and faith and a great number of people were brought to the lord then barnabas went to
[1945.56 --> 1953.08]  taurus to look for saul and when he found him he brought him to antioch so for a whole year barnabas
[1953.08 --> 1959.64]  and saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people the disciples were called christians
[1959.64 --> 1967.72]  first at antioch during this time some prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch one of them
[1967.72 --> 1973.40]  named agabus stood up and through the spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over
[1973.40 --> 1981.48]  the entire roman world this happened during the reign of claudius the disciples as each one was able
[1981.48 --> 1988.76]  to decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in judea this they did sending their
[1988.76 --> 1993.96]  gift to the elders by barnabas and saul this is the word of the lord
[2001.88 --> 2004.28]  thank you terry let's pray as we begin
[2006.36 --> 2012.76]  father we thank you this morning for your word we thank you for this window into the work of your spirit
[2012.76 --> 2021.16]  building up a new church and i pray that we would be encouraged as we read about our ancestors in the
[2021.16 --> 2028.52]  faith those who have gone before us and lord would you take your word and would it take deep root
[2029.64 --> 2035.24]  in our hearts and would it bear fruit to your honor and glory we pray in jesus name amen
[2035.24 --> 2043.80]  so i've been listening to a podcast recently called undeceptions undeceptions and the host of the
[2043.80 --> 2052.12]  podcast is john dixon and he is a church historian from australia and he tells the following story
[2052.84 --> 2061.80]  this is what he says one friday morning in 2017 i hired a cello now that's i guess australian for
[2061.80 --> 2070.76]  the second or rented he hired a cello he paid for a two-hour lesson and pr and i practiced my heart
[2070.76 --> 2079.08]  out for five days straight the following tuesday i had to be on stage performing the opening bars
[2079.08 --> 2087.40]  of bach's incomparable prelude to cello suite number one in g major the only problem was i had never held
[2087.40 --> 2095.72]  a cello in my life so it was a daunting experience especially as i had a play in this gorgeous sydney
[2095.72 --> 2101.16]  theater now some of you might be scratching your heads thinking what on earth is this guy doing
[2102.44 --> 2108.76]  and the reason he did this was to make a point so he says on that tuesday in the sydney opera house
[2108.76 --> 2117.00]  he played this piece from bach on his cello and what happened is as you can imagine he played it
[2117.00 --> 2123.64]  terribly it was awful but as soon as he was finished waiting in the wings was another man who was a
[2123.64 --> 2131.96]  concert cellist and he came out onto the stage to play the piece properly and he played it absolutely
[2131.96 --> 2138.20]  beautifully beautifully now why on earth did this happen like what was dixon trying to do was it just
[2138.20 --> 2147.00]  to completely embarrass himself well no he he was making the point that christianity is like a beautiful
[2147.00 --> 2154.04]  piece of music that god has written with this beautiful tune and as a church historian dixon
[2154.04 --> 2161.40]  acknowledges that throughout history some christians have played the tune of the gospel pretty terribly
[2162.52 --> 2169.08]  they haven't known how to play it they they got it all wrong they've made a mess of it it sounded awful
[2170.20 --> 2178.68]  but when a musician plays a piece of music horribly we don't blame the composer or the quality of the
[2178.68 --> 2187.72]  music right obviously the fault lies with the musician right their performance shouldn't invalidate
[2187.72 --> 2192.52]  the beauty and the genius of the music itself the beauty and the genius of the music itself and the music
[2192.52 --> 2200.20]  of god's grace this music of the gospel is this beautiful tune that god wants to play through his people
[2201.24 --> 2209.00]  and the truth is as christians and as the church in the world we don't always get this right sometimes our
[2209.00 --> 2225.56]  performance is pretty awful we don't always play this tune very well but our text today shows it shows us a church that did begin to play the music of the gospel
[2225.56 --> 2233.56]  incredibly beautifully and we when we look at the church in antioch in a sense we can hear the
[2233.56 --> 2240.12]  beautiful music the music of the gospel that god has written and we can see it and we can hear it played
[2240.92 --> 2248.60]  beautifully this amazing performance of the gospel and so as we look at our text this morning there are three
[2248.60 --> 2253.88]  movements that we see movements that we see here first there's this movement of how the gospel came to
[2253.88 --> 2261.16]  antioch and how a great number of people believed in the lord and then second we see barnabas coming
[2261.16 --> 2267.88]  and building up the church through this ministry of encouragement and then third we see how god's grace was
[2267.88 --> 2275.48]  working so powerfully in that early church that they are then able to actually look out for the welfare of others
[2275.48 --> 2284.44]  and so let's look this morning more closely at the this movement of god's spirit at this beautiful music of the gospel as
[2284.44 --> 2286.76]  it's being played by these new musicians
[2287.48 --> 2293.48]  who have in a sense never held the instrument of the gospel before but they're they're just playing it so beautifully
[2293.96 --> 2295.24]  what can we learn
[2295.96 --> 2297.96]  from this church in antioch
[2297.96 --> 2301.64]  about how we as latiner crc can play this music of the gospel
[2301.64 --> 2306.04]  so that's what we're going to look at this morning and so first we have the first movement
[2306.04 --> 2312.28]  a church gathered into jesus and we're going to look here again at verses 19 to 21.
[2312.84 --> 2319.24]  so i'll have the the passage here on the screen 19 to 21. now those who had been scattered by the
[2319.24 --> 2325.08]  persecution that broke out when stephen was killed traveled as far as phoenicia right up the coast
[2325.08 --> 2336.28]  the first to cyprus and antioch spreading the word only among the jews some of them however men from
[2336.28 --> 2342.92]  cyprus and cyrene went to antioch and began to spread to speak to greeks also
[2344.36 --> 2349.64]  telling them the good news about the lord jesus the lord's hand was with them and a great number of
[2349.64 --> 2356.28]  people believed and turned to the lord so let's take a look at this some of the people who fled
[2356.28 --> 2363.56]  from jerusalem fled up the coast up to phoenicia cyprus and antioch now these were jews who went up there
[2364.44 --> 2369.00]  and these and what they were doing is that they were sharing the gospel right wherever they went
[2369.88 --> 2373.80]  as many as they had opportunity they would share the gospel and it says but they were spreading
[2373.80 --> 2380.76]  the word only among the jews so at first the followers of jesus were mostly jews right in
[2380.76 --> 2387.48]  jerusalem in judea they were jews jesus the apostles the 70 disciples the church that was being built up
[2387.48 --> 2396.04]  there they were jews they were jewish christians and when wherever they went they spoke mostly to other
[2396.60 --> 2402.36]  jews right so they would go to a new place they would find the jewish community that was already
[2402.36 --> 2408.36]  gathered there and they would tell them jesus is the long-awaited messiah they would preach the gospel
[2408.36 --> 2415.88]  to the jews and so in this sense they were actually sharing the gospel with people who were very much
[2415.88 --> 2422.68]  like them right and that's a little bit more easy okay they're sharing with people who are like them
[2422.68 --> 2431.00]  fellow jews but when they got to antioch there were some the text says who went beyond themselves
[2431.00 --> 2435.72]  right who were not sharing the gospel with people who were sharing the gospel with people who were
[2435.72 --> 2444.28]  not like them at all because it says they began to speak to greeks also not just jews to greeks now
[2444.28 --> 2450.68]  when the text says greeks or some translations say hellenus it means people who are not jewish
[2451.32 --> 2458.84]  they were greek speakers of all kinds of different ethnicities from all over the roman empire and beyond
[2458.84 --> 2464.36]  right and all of these different people they spoke greek because that was the common language of the
[2464.36 --> 2471.00]  day right the military campaigns of alexander the great had spread the greek language and culture all
[2471.00 --> 2479.40]  over that part of the world into africa into persia into syria turkey europe the whole world was speaking
[2479.40 --> 2485.80]  greek and they'd also have their local languages and that is why the new testament is written in what
[2485.80 --> 2491.08]  certain in greek not in hebrew not in any other language because that was the common language of
[2491.08 --> 2497.64]  the day so for the first time in the story of acts though at antioch the person and the work of jesus
[2497.64 --> 2506.68]  are told to people who likely had no prior experience of god at all the the god that we worship no familiarity
[2506.68 --> 2514.36]  at all with the hebrew bible the old testament scriptures they were hearing this completely new for the first
[2514.36 --> 2524.36]  time but they were given the message of the gospel and it says many came to faith in christ so this is
[2524.36 --> 2530.20]  amazing and we need to explore this a bit more because when we think about this we realize that this is a
[2530.20 --> 2535.64]  stunning thing so just to give you a bit of the background here on the city of antioch
[2535.64 --> 2545.96]  antioch antioch was the third largest city in the roman empire after rome and after alexandria okay so
[2545.96 --> 2552.84]  this is a big deal antioch was a major urban center of the day it was a very influential and important
[2552.84 --> 2559.80]  city in the first century the population was estimated to be about half a million people which
[2559.80 --> 2566.68]  was massive in that day it was an incredibly cosmopolitan city it had large population of jews
[2567.24 --> 2574.04]  but it also collected people from all over from africa and persia and greece and rome even as far
[2574.04 --> 2582.20]  as china all over they were living in the antioch because saluce seleukasid his name
[2582.20 --> 2589.96]  the the official who had established the city he gave equal citizenship to anybody who would come and
[2589.96 --> 2595.32]  live in the city and so all of these people were flooding into antioch is at the crossroads of all
[2595.32 --> 2603.72]  these trade routes and it was known for its religious diversity this is what's happening in acts now what
[2603.72 --> 2610.76]  was fascinating also about antioch was that all of these different ethnicities did not love each other
[2611.56 --> 2618.60]  and they did not mix well so much so that antioch was famed for having walls built not only around
[2618.60 --> 2625.72]  the outside of the city to protect from the outside but they were walls built inside the city they had
[2625.72 --> 2632.60]  these interior walls that were arranged to sort of demarcate the city to kind of separate all of these
[2632.60 --> 2638.36]  different groups from one another so they have these different quadrants of the city for different
[2638.36 --> 2645.00]  cultures and there was so much difficulty relationally amongst these different peoples that they had
[2645.00 --> 2653.48]  literally built walls to separate them but what is remarkable about the church at antioch is that the
[2653.48 --> 2660.28]  gospel comes to all of these different groups of people and all people from all of these different
[2660.28 --> 2672.12]  groups come to faith in jesus and they begin worshiping together one god they worship one god they were united
[2672.12 --> 2680.12]  together and this was totally unheard of what on earth was going on here why was this happening how could
[2680.12 --> 2687.08]  this be well what happened was something profound happened to these people who had previously taken
[2687.08 --> 2693.16]  taken such a huge amount of pride and identity in their own ethnicity their own culture their own
[2693.16 --> 2701.64]  people but now something happened to them that even trumped all of that all of these other usual ways that they
[2701.64 --> 2708.52]  would find their identity and so what was bigger what was the bigger thing that happened to them
[2708.52 --> 2714.84]  and the bigger thing is that they encountered the gospel of jesus christ right people who previously
[2714.84 --> 2722.04]  didn't even look at one another received the grace of god together and they learned that what happened was
[2722.04 --> 2729.16]  they learned that they had all rebelled against god and that they because of that were far away from him
[2729.96 --> 2736.68]  but that god in his love came to rescue them he came to give his own life to save them and to bring them close to god
[2736.68 --> 2744.28]  and when that grace and that love of god filled them they realized that they all belonged to god and they
[2744.28 --> 2750.04]  were loved by god through jesus christ it brought them together into this new identity that they shared
[2751.80 --> 2760.60]  and this was so stunning in antioch that all the people watching this had no category to understand it
[2760.60 --> 2769.40]  religions in that day were typically linked to your ethnicity to your people your culture where you came
[2769.40 --> 2778.20]  from but for the first time there was a religion a faith tradition where people were worshiping one god
[2779.48 --> 2787.80]  they were gathering together and they were embracing people everywhere and so people who are observing this
[2787.80 --> 2792.84]  were saying like we need to invent a new category for this for what is going on we have never seen
[2792.84 --> 2798.76]  anything like this this is blowing our minds and so what do they do they started calling them what
[2800.60 --> 2808.68]  christians christians you know and maybe you thought that christian was a new name that christians
[2808.68 --> 2816.52]  decided to give themselves but that's not what this passage says in verse 26 it says the disciples were called
[2816.52 --> 2823.00]  christians for the first time at antioch they were called christians by those outside the church
[2824.28 --> 2830.44]  people realized that what was happening is that all of these different people were following jesus
[2832.04 --> 2838.68]  they were following this this this guy his life his teachings that is what is animating them that is
[2838.68 --> 2844.04]  what is drawing them together and so they were called christians and friends this is a beautiful thing
[2844.04 --> 2849.00]  thing and this is something that i think as a church that we can be inspired and encouraged by
[2850.36 --> 2859.00]  what exactly does this mean for us at lanter crc it means that as a fellowship as a local congregation
[2859.64 --> 2867.72]  our unity that we have together is because we are a church gathered into jesus christ right and god has
[2867.72 --> 2876.52]  given us this body and this is a profound gift this is a profound gift that god has given us right god
[2876.52 --> 2885.96]  designed the church not to be just all one culture all one people but to be diverse and not just diverse
[2885.96 --> 2894.04]  ethnically but also in terms of life stage right people who are older people who are younger right in in
[2894.04 --> 2903.80]  terms of economic class you know richer and poorer in terms of men and women singles and married and we all bring
[2903.80 --> 2909.16]  our experiences we all bring our wisdom our experiences of god and we bring them together
[2911.24 --> 2917.72]  and so the believers they they shared the gospel and the lord added to the church and so friends
[2917.72 --> 2927.24]  can we be a church that is boldly gladly joyfully speaking about the good news of jesus to people
[2927.24 --> 2935.24]  who are all around us so that's what we see here this gathering into jesus christ so now we would probably do
[2935.24 --> 2940.36]  well to ask ourselves well what exactly happened to all these people after they were converted
[2940.36 --> 2948.76]  and that's the second movement that we see in our texts it's a church growing into jesus okay so it says
[2948.76 --> 2955.24]  the lord's hand was with them a great number of people believed and turned to the lord so what happens next
[2956.04 --> 2964.28]  well let's keep reading and let's look at verse 22 it says this news of this right all of these people were
[2964.28 --> 2970.92]  were coming into the church believing in jesus news of this reached the church in jerusalem and so they
[2970.92 --> 2977.96]  sent barnabas to antioch okay so so here we see barnabas getting sent by the church in jerusalem to
[2977.96 --> 2983.08]  antioch to check out what is happening right they heard that all of these different people were believing
[2983.08 --> 2988.12]  in jesus and they wanted to go check it out what what on earth is happening here
[2988.12 --> 2996.04]  in barnabas you know i don't know if you're very very familiar with barnabas but i find that the
[2996.04 --> 3003.32]  more you get to know barnabas the more you grow to admire him and love him so barnabas was first
[3003.32 --> 3012.60]  introduced to us in chapter four and when we first met barnabas he was a new believer himself and he had
[3012.60 --> 3019.40]  sold a plot of land that belonged to him and he brought the proceeds to the disciples or to the
[3019.40 --> 3023.56]  apostles and he said to them put this to good use this is for the good of the community
[3024.44 --> 3028.60]  says barnabas he's the one of those guys who had sold this land and gave the money to the church
[3029.24 --> 3037.80]  and then he shows up in in chapter nine when the newly converted saul arrives in jerusalem the
[3037.80 --> 3044.52]  disciples there were slow to embrace him right they were wondering if this guy who had caused so
[3044.52 --> 3049.16]  much grief in the church who had persecuted the church they were wondering if he had truly given
[3049.16 --> 3057.40]  his life to jesus and the text says that they were afraid of him we can understand but it's barnabas who
[3057.40 --> 3065.40]  stands up for him it's barnabas who advocates for saul and says because of the grace of the lord this man
[3065.40 --> 3073.48]  is our brother and so they embrace him as one of their own so that's barnabas so now here in chapter 11
[3073.48 --> 3082.36]  barnabas is back on the scene he the church sends him to antioch he arrives there in verse 23 it says
[3082.36 --> 3091.16]  this when he arrived and saw what the grace of god had done he was glad i mean that's kind of weak
[3091.16 --> 3100.76]  it yeah it's okay go uh go back yeah it says he was glad he was joyful he was exceedingly joyful he
[3100.76 --> 3108.68]  was ecstatic he saw what god was doing amongst all of these people and he was so excited he was filled
[3108.68 --> 3116.12]  with joy to see this visible evidence of the grace of god at work so then what does he do he he kind of
[3116.12 --> 3123.48]  working quietly working behind the scenes in verse 23 it goes on and he says this he was glad and
[3123.48 --> 3129.40]  encouraged them all to remain true to the lord with all their hearts right that's so beautiful
[3131.08 --> 3137.16]  people had believed the message about jesus they'd been gathered into jesus but barnabas wanted to help
[3137.16 --> 3143.96]  them to remain faithful to them to remain faithful to jesus right and so conversion this initial belief
[3143.96 --> 3151.32]  in jesus calling on god well that can happen quickly by the work of the holy spirit but growth
[3152.52 --> 3161.24]  maturity working out what it means to follow jesus when your whole world has been turned upside down
[3161.24 --> 3166.68]  and learning what that means for your relationship with god for your understanding of yourself and how you
[3166.68 --> 3172.60]  relate to others and relate to everything that is also a work of the holy spirit that is a process
[3173.64 --> 3181.64]  and this takes time and it tells us here how barnabas did this patient work how did he do it notice
[3181.64 --> 3190.52]  what it says here it says he encouraged them he encouraged them oh you're like okay well big deal right
[3190.52 --> 3196.60]  but actually this word encourage is a bit unique it's kind of a million dollar word in the
[3196.60 --> 3204.12]  scriptures because it's made up of two parts that kind of seem to be opposites and it's our the greek
[3204.12 --> 3210.92]  word parakaleo so here it is and you know often we don't need to go into the greek but sometimes we
[3210.92 --> 3215.08]  need to look at it because it helps us understand the word in a way that just looking at the english
[3215.08 --> 3224.44]  can't really help us so parakaleo the second part kaleo means to call and specifically it means to point
[3224.44 --> 3232.52]  somebody towards the truth so it can be sometimes translated to urge or to exhort and it's almost
[3232.52 --> 3239.80]  like a command and it's kind of like this very strong fatherly exhortation calling someone pointing
[3239.80 --> 3248.36]  them toward the truth but the other part of the word para means to come alongside someone so to stand
[3248.36 --> 3255.16]  with someone and so when we put them together we get this word parakaleo and it means to urge someone
[3255.16 --> 3264.04]  towards the truth lovingly right so that's cool so you have these very these two ideas this very tender
[3264.04 --> 3272.68]  coming alongside someone and then encouraging them to remain faithful to the lord to live holy lives to
[3272.68 --> 3282.84]  serve jesus and as we see here barnabas built an entire ministry on this his was a ministry of
[3282.84 --> 3290.28]  encouragement really we can say his was a ministry of discipleship he called these new believers
[3291.56 --> 3300.60]  to see jesus more clearly to marvel at jesus and to let the beauty of jesus the sufficiency of jesus
[3300.60 --> 3308.76]  color and illuminate every single other aspect of their lives and our text tells us that a great
[3308.76 --> 3314.76]  many people deepened their trust in the lord through this ministry of joining truth and love
[3316.68 --> 3323.48]  and we see this beautiful tune of the gospel being performed and i think one of the things that we can
[3323.48 --> 3331.56]  learn from this is that one of the ways one of the key ways that god often uses in our life to cause us
[3331.56 --> 3338.04]  to grow in the christian life is through other people investing in us in this way you know i have
[3338.04 --> 3343.00]  found that whenever i've been in like a small group or with a group of christians or people and i asked them
[3343.00 --> 3351.32]  the question you know when you look back at your life what has god used in your life to most cause you to grow
[3351.32 --> 3356.20]  in your faith when you look back at your life as a christian what are those moments when you feel
[3356.20 --> 3365.96]  like you've made kind of leaps or you've really grown in your faith and it's not usually hearing a sermon
[3367.64 --> 3373.72]  it's often not you know reading a certain book or or going to a christian conference or any of these
[3373.72 --> 3381.08]  kinds of things often what people do when they think about that is they think about a barnabas someone
[3381.32 --> 3390.60]  who had come alongside them and help them to follow jesus and that reminds me that we need other
[3390.60 --> 3399.72]  christians in our lives to walk with us to walk alongside us and to lovingly point out the truth that we need to hear
[3402.04 --> 3407.56]  and so let me ask you this question the same question who has been the barnabas in your life
[3408.28 --> 3413.96]  who has helped you learn in some way how to follow jesus more faithfully
[3416.84 --> 3422.36]  you know maybe as you will think about your own life you can identify one or several people who have
[3422.36 --> 3427.08]  played a role maybe just for a short time maybe for a longer period of time in different ways
[3427.08 --> 3433.72]  but you can think back and look at the ways that people have walked alongside you and done this
[3433.72 --> 3443.32]  ministry and so then the other question is who is your barnabas right now is there someone in your life
[3443.32 --> 3453.80]  who is playing that role maybe and if if not maybe that's something to pray about no god you know if maybe you
[3453.80 --> 3461.56]  can be open to god providing someone in your life who who might step in and play this role and then
[3461.56 --> 3467.48]  another question i want us to ponder is who is god asking you to be a barnabas to someone else
[3467.48 --> 3477.24]  who might god be leading you to have this ministry of encouragement to engage in someone else's life
[3477.24 --> 3484.04]  to walk alongside them and to encourage them to be faithful to god and i want you to pray about that
[3484.60 --> 3491.24]  i want to encourage you to pray about that and ask god who he might be putting asking you to play this
[3491.24 --> 3498.36]  role in someone else's life okay so now notice that when barnabas shows up with his ministry of
[3498.36 --> 3506.44]  encouragement people start growing right things begin happening faith blossoms and that leads us to the
[3506.44 --> 3512.20]  third and final movement of this music of god's grace that we see being performed so beautifully by the
[3512.20 --> 3519.56]  church in antioch the third movement is a church living generously like jesus you know and i think it's so
[3519.56 --> 3524.52]  amazing here that this group of believers who are called christians for their first time they are
[3524.52 --> 3533.56]  called christians little christ kind of because they are recognized as being so much like jesus and we
[3533.56 --> 3540.36]  see this how are they like jesus we see this in their generosity so let's read the last part of our text
[3540.36 --> 3542.76]  this morning beginning in verse 27.
[3542.76 --> 3551.48]  during this time some prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch one of them named agabus stood
[3551.48 --> 3557.96]  up and through the spirit predicted foretelling in the future that a severe famine would spread over
[3557.96 --> 3565.24]  the entire roman world this happened during the reign of claudius the disciples as each one was able
[3565.24 --> 3572.44]  decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in judea this they did sending their gift
[3572.44 --> 3583.00]  to the elders of jerusalem by barnabas and saul so this famine in the land ended up becoming an
[3583.00 --> 3591.24]  opportunity for the christians in antioch to demonstrate financial generosity to their poorer
[3591.24 --> 3597.48]  brothers and sisters in judea and so even right off the bat they started to see themselves not only as
[3597.48 --> 3606.68]  this local church in antioch but connected with with god's body wherever it is and what's amazing to
[3606.68 --> 3615.72]  me is that this generosity happened at a time of famine and of crisis right i mean we can imagine
[3615.72 --> 3621.40]  let's say if someone got up and had a prophetic word we don't do that much in our tradition but
[3621.40 --> 3629.24]  let's say someone got up and said hey there is going to be a huge famine you'd probably what how
[3629.24 --> 3637.24]  would we react we might say if we believe them well let me save as much as we can right let's be like
[3637.88 --> 3643.24]  joseph let's do what he did and save up and store seven years worth of grain so we can get through this
[3643.24 --> 3652.60]  but that is not what they heard god telling them to do that's not the application of this prophecy that
[3652.60 --> 3661.16]  they heard it was a time of crisis and yet the call of the church was to be generous to give to extend
[3661.16 --> 3668.68]  themselves for the benefit of others and i think this can encourage us as well this can inspire us
[3668.68 --> 3676.68]  us that in the kingdom of god every crisis is an opportunity for the church to shine right every
[3678.04 --> 3684.68]  every crisis is an opportunity to play this beautiful music of the gospel for the world to see and to
[3684.68 --> 3692.68]  demonstrate the love of jesus and to serve him you know and sometimes in our lives in the life of our
[3692.68 --> 3700.60]  church we face uncertainty or or we we experience the cross pressures of our time and culture that we
[3700.60 --> 3706.20]  live in and we may be worried about our future the future of our church the future of our families
[3707.32 --> 3713.48]  but friends these are times when the world needs the gospel more than ever these are times when we need
[3713.48 --> 3721.00]  to truly be the church of jesus and to double down with living out the gospel with courage and wisdom
[3721.00 --> 3728.20]  and with truth and love and pour ourselves out in his mission right not just thinking about how to
[3728.20 --> 3734.68]  conserve and preserve ourselves and this is what kingdom life looks like so the question i want to
[3734.68 --> 3743.40]  ask us as a church is what might the challenge and the opportunity that we're facing be where god is
[3743.40 --> 3750.20]  asking us to extend ourselves generously for others what is the opportunity that we as a church having
[3750.20 --> 3756.68]  been gathered into christ built up into christ can now demonstrate the love and the grace of christ
[3756.68 --> 3765.64]  that we have received to others not to preserve but where's god calling us to courageously step into
[3765.64 --> 3773.56]  the work of his kingdom let's go to god now in prayer and let's ask him to speak to us let's ask him to
[3773.56 --> 3781.48]  lead us as a church so that we can also we can be a church that plays the beautiful tune of god's grace
[3781.48 --> 3789.48]  that he wants to play through us let's pray together father we do pray that you would help us truly
[3790.60 --> 3800.04]  be a church that takes the music of the gospel and that we would perform it beautifully that we would play it
[3800.04 --> 3808.92]  in a way that people could see and hear and that would bring you glory and honor lord would you help
[3808.92 --> 3816.52]  us by your spirit to gather people into christ would you help us to be built up into christ to remain
[3816.52 --> 3823.48]  faithful to you with all of our hearts and lord would you help us to be an expression of your generous
[3823.48 --> 3829.72]  grace that we have received we pray this for ourselves we pray this for other churches in our city
[3830.92 --> 3833.80]  we ask this all in jesus name amen
[3839.24 --> 3846.68]  so let's get ready to sing our song of response as i check our order of worship it is shout for the

[4379.40 --> 4387.38]  May you enable the efforts of this organization to bring meaningful and systemic change in the lives of those world renewed can touch,
[4388.06 --> 4392.22]  and may the gifts shared today be put to good use in furthering those efforts.
[4393.36 --> 4399.00]  Rock of Ages, give us all fresh confidence that there is no future where you are not present,
[4399.54 --> 4401.60]  no sorrow where you are not near,
[4402.16 --> 4404.16]  no tears not kept in your bottle,
[4404.16 --> 4407.38]  no disaster-ridden years you will not restore.
[4408.12 --> 4411.34]  Let us trust in you and rejoice in you, our Lord and Savior,
[4411.56 --> 4414.02]  today, this week, and always.
[4414.86 --> 4417.06]  All this we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4417.06 --> 4417.20]  Amen.
[4427.92 --> 4429.42]  Please rise for the benediction.
[4429.42 --> 4434.16]  Thank you for coming together,
[4434.44 --> 4435.82]  worshiping the Lord together this morning.
[4436.28 --> 4439.42]  Please do join us for our time of fellowship and...
[4440.98 --> 4441.54]  Cake.
[4441.98 --> 4443.02]  Let's hear it. Cake!
[4443.62 --> 4444.46]  Just kidding. Okay.
[4444.60 --> 4447.42]  Cake and coffee right through the doors of the fellowship hall.
[4448.36 --> 4449.46]  And if you are new with us today,
[4449.52 --> 4451.28]  we especially are glad that you've joined us.
[4452.26 --> 4456.50]  So hear these words of God's blessing to us from the book of Jude.
[4456.50 --> 4459.54]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4460.76 --> 4463.70]  To him who is able to keep you from falling
[4463.70 --> 4468.64]  and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4469.30 --> 4472.80]  To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[4472.80 --> 4477.50]  through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages and forevermore.
[4478.02 --> 4478.42]  Amen.
[4479.80 --> 4482.72]  And please remain standing and we'll sing our final song together.
[4482.72 --> 4505.60]  O my children with my blessing, never alone,
[4505.60 --> 4515.60]  Waking, sleeping, I am with you. You are my own.
[4517.20 --> 4526.60]  In my love's bandage forever, I have made you mine forever.
[4526.60 --> 4537.60]  Go, my children, with my blessing, you are my own.
[4540.10 --> 4549.60]  Go, my children, fed and nourished closer to me.
[4549.60 --> 4560.60]  Grow in love and love by serving, joyful and free.
[4561.60 --> 4572.60]  Here my spirit's power filled you. Here his tender comfort still you.
[4572.60 --> 4583.60]  Go, my children, fed and nourished, joyful and free.
[4583.60 --> 4584.60]  Happy.
[4584.60 --> 4585.60]  Happy.
