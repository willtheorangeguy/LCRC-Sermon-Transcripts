• Explanation of why Christians attend church regularly to worship God and learn their individual stories in the context of the biblical story
• Discussion of how people are shaped by stories and narratives, and how the Christian narrative provides hope and meaning in life's circumstances
• The biblical story is a play with four acts: creation, fall, redemption, and final consummation.
• Creation: God created all things and made humans to live with him forever in a good world (Genesis 1-2).
• Fall: Adam and Eve fell into sin by trying to write their own script and dismissing God as the author (Genesis 3).
• Redemption: God's plan was to send Jesus Christ, his son, to save humanity (New Testament).
• Consummation: The final act tells of a future time when God will restore the good world he made and bring all things into harmony with himself.
• Death is seen as temporary in this context, and those who know the end of the story can have hope despite losing loved ones.
• The resurrection of Jesus as a story/myth that actually happened
