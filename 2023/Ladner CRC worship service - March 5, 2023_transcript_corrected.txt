[445.42 → 449.34] And maybe there was a slight improvement, Tony was telling us.
[449.66 → 451.38] So be sure to keep him in your prayers.
[452.42 → 459.08] And also, some of you might know Tony's sister now is in her last days too.
[459.08 → 461.46] And so comfort there also with prayer.
[462.74 → 466.00] And now John Mantra has an announcement to make.

[477.94 → 482.48] You'll find a pamphlet in your mailbox today.
[482.48 → 486.34] And this is a survey that's done by the CRC every five years.
[486.78 → 488.70] Our church gets surveyed every five years.
[489.56 → 491.06] And you can do it online.
[491.92 → 497.76] Or we've put some paper ones you can do on the foyer table.
[497.82 → 500.46] And we've put some in the mail slots if we know you don't have an email.
[501.52 → 506.02] If you're a couple or if there's more than one adult in your household, each can do a survey.
[506.02 → 514.98] And if you are obviously the members, but if you are not a member but a regular attender, you're also welcome to do this survey.
[515.72 → 525.46] And if enough people in our church do the survey, our church council will get the results of the people of our church who have done the survey.
[525.74 → 530.12] And this will help our council for planning and for ministry.
[530.56 → 532.28] And, of course, the survey is anonymous.
[533.06 → 534.92] And you don't have to put your name on it.
[534.92 → 537.08] So thank you and I encourage you to take part.

[890.96 → 892.42] Keep me safe, O God,
[892.96 → 894.88] for I have come to you for refuge.
[895.66 → 896.96] I said to the Lord,
[897.16 → 898.20] you are my master.
[898.20 → 901.56] Every good thing I have comes from you.
[902.60 → 905.54] The godly people in the land are my true heroes.
[906.10 → 907.28] I take pleasure in them.
[908.66 → 912.00] Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods.
[912.78 → 915.72] I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood
[915.72 → 918.88] or even speak the names of their gods.
[919.76 → 922.56] Lord, you alone are my inheritance,
[923.06 → 924.40] my cup of blessing.
[925.24 → 927.12] You guard all that is mine.
[927.12 → 929.94] The land you have given me is a pleasant land.
[930.84 → 932.40] What a wonderful inheritance.
[932.40 → 939.14] O for the thousand times we sing,
[939.14 → 939.48] I bring the deepest praise.
[939.48 → 943.16] O for the thousand times we sing,
[943.16 → 947.50] I bring the deepest praise.

[966.14 → 970.74] God's triumphs of His grace.
[970.74 → 973.90] My gracious Master,
[973.90 → 975.74] and my God,
[975.74 → 979.76] assist me to proclaim,
[980.30 → 983.48] He'll spread through all the earth,
[983.48 → 988.90] and from the honours of your name.
[988.90 → 990.26] Jesus is the name of Jesus.
[990.26 → 992.36] He diva,
[992.36 → 992.50] and.
[992.50 → 993.04] Jesus is the name of Jesus,

[995.36 → 996.10] and journey to felony,
[996.14 → 999.08] which means your hope and life.
[999.26 → 1003.76] It is music in the sinner's ears.
[1004.02 → 1007.98] He is life and hell and peace.

[1015.58 → 1017.98] sets the prisoner free
[1018.88 → 1023.42] He's broken in the promise key
[1023.42 → 1027.98] He's broken in for me
[1028.62 → 1034.70] Here in heaven, please praise me now
[1034.70 → 1039.04] Our distant times have gone
[1039.04 → 1042.96] You are beyond our Saviour
[1042.96 → 1048.84] Come, and we believe for joy
[1048.84 → 1054.90] Glory to God and praise Him
[1054.90 → 1060.18] Be now and ever again
[1060.18 → 1064.52] For I sit below unsensible
[1064.52 → 1070.44] Not true to earth and earth
[1070.44 → 1077.52] Psalm 16 continues
[1077.52 → 1080.64] I will bless the Lord who guides me
[1080.64 → 1083.26] Even at night my heart instructs me
[1083.26 → 1085.96] I know the Lord is always with me
[1085.96 → 1089.28] I will not be shaken for He is right beside me
[1089.28 → 1092.04] No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice
[1092.04 → 1094.24] My body rests in safety
[1094.24 → 1097.28] For you will not leave my soul among the dead
[1097.28 → 1100.10] Or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave
[1100.10 → 1102.46] You will show me the way of life
[1102.46 → 1105.14] Granting me the joy of your presence
[1105.14 → 1108.96] And the pleasures of living with you forever
[1108.96 → 1110.34] Amen
[1110.34 → 1113.62] This next song is just a wonderful prayer
[1113.62 → 1115.92] That we can all share together
[1115.92 → 1119.50] And if we could see everything in this song
[1119.50 → 1121.00] In this prayer come through
[1121.00 → 1123.48] It would be a glorious thing
[1123.48 → 1145.76] Speak O Lord as we come to you
[1145.76 → 1152.76] To receive the fruit of your holy word
[1152.76 → 1155.76] Take your truth
[1155.76 → 1159.02] Plant it deep in us
[1159.02 → 1162.26] Shape and fasten us
[1162.26 → 1165.70] In your likeness
[1165.70 → 1169.10] That the light of Christ
[1169.10 → 1172.14] Might be seen today
[1172.14 → 1175.56] In our acts of love
[1175.56 → 1179.14] And our deeds of faith
[1179.14 → 1182.30] Speak O Lord
[1182.30 → 1185.48] And fulfill in us
[1185.48 → 1188.24] All your purposes
[1188.24 → 1191.78] For your glory
[1191.78 → 1202.28] Teach us Lord
[1202.28 → 1204.78] Full obedience
[1204.78 → 1208.48] Holy reverence
[1208.48 → 1211.28] True humility
[1211.28 → 1214.98] Test our thoughts
[1214.98 → 1217.78] And our attitudes
[1217.78 → 1221.20] In the radiance
[1221.20 → 1223.78] Of your purity
[1223.78 → 1227.86] Cause our faith to rise
[1227.86 → 1230.98] Cause our eyes to see
[1230.98 → 1233.78] Your majestic love
[1234.30 → 1237.12] And authority
[1237.12 → 1241.12] Words of power
[1241.12 → 1244.24] That can never fail
[1244.24 → 1246.78] Let their truth reveal
[1246.78 → 1249.78] Over on you
[1249.78 → 1250.78] Over on you
[1250.78 → 1261.16] Speak O Lord
[1261.16 → 1264.26] And renew our minds
[1264.26 → 1267.52] Help us grasp the heights
[1267.52 → 1270.78] Of your plans for us
[1270.78 → 1272.78] Truths unchanged
[1272.78 → 1274.14] Truths unchanged
[1274.14 → 1276.78] From the dawn of time
[1277.32 → 1279.78] That will echo down
[1279.78 → 1282.78] Through eternity
[1282.78 → 1286.78] And by grace will spread
[1286.78 → 1290.04] On your promises
[1290.04 → 1293.82] And by faith will walk
[1293.82 → 1298.12] As you walk with us
[1298.12 → 1300.12] Speak O Lord
[1300.12 → 1300.80] Speak O Lord
[1300.80 → 1304.02] Till your church is built
[1304.02 → 1307.38] And the earth is filled
[1307.38 → 1310.50] With your glory
[1310.50 → 1321.62] You may be seated
[1321.62 → 1337.24] For our time of confession
[1337.24 → 1339.90] Let us confess our sin
[1339.90 → 1341.42] Before God and one another
[1341.42 → 1342.92] With these words
[1342.92 → 1345.66] Gracious God
[1345.66 → 1347.22] You have given us
[1347.22 → 1348.38] The law of Moses
[1348.38 → 1349.94] And the teachings
[1349.94 → 1350.74] Of Jesus
[1350.74 → 1352.58] To direct us
[1352.58 → 1353.94] In the way of life
[1353.94 → 1356.60] You offer us
[1356.60 → 1357.92] Your Holy Spirit
[1357.92 → 1360.34] So that we can be born
[1360.34 → 1361.84] To new life
[1361.84 → 1362.66] As your children
[1362.66 → 1365.58] Yet O God
[1365.58 → 1366.80] We confess
[1366.80 → 1368.22] That the ways of death
[1368.22 → 1370.14] Have a strong attraction
[1370.14 → 1372.68] And we often succumb
[1372.68 → 1373.90] To their lure
[1373.90 → 1376.82] Give us the vision
[1376.82 → 1377.92] And courage
[1377.92 → 1379.16] To choose
[1379.16 → 1380.64] And nurture life
[1380.64 → 1382.70] That we may receive

[1384.88 → 1389.68] God's assurance
[1389.68 → 1390.74] Of pardon
[1390.74 → 1391.86] And forgiveness
[1391.86 → 1392.66] Of sin
[1392.66 → 1394.74] Is from Romans 5
[1394.74 → 1395.88] Verses 1 and 2
[1395.88 → 1399.02] Since we are justified
[1399.02 → 1400.14] By faith
[1400.14 → 1402.84] We have peace with God
[1402.84 → 1405.40] Through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1405.40 → 1406.66] Through whom
[1406.66 → 1408.08] We have obtained
[1408.08 → 1409.86] Access to this grace
[1409.86 → 1411.38] In which we stand
[1411.38 → 1413.12] And we boast
[1413.12 → 1414.04] In our hope
[1414.04 → 1415.20] Of sharing
[1415.20 → 1416.84] The glory of God
[1425.88 → 1438.54] O the deep
[1438.54 → 1442.60] Deep love of Jesus
[1442.60 → 1446.10] Has done measure
[1446.10 → 1449.36] Thou was free
[1449.36 → 1451.34] Holy
[1451.34 → 1456.82] As the mighty ocean

[1460.32 → 1464.16] Over me
[1464.16 → 1468.16] Underneath me
[1468.16 → 1471.68] All around me
[1471.68 → 1475.40] Is the current
[1475.40 → 1478.88] Of my heart
[1478.88 → 1482.78] Leading onward
[1482.78 → 1482.84] Leading onward
[1482.84 → 1485.84] Leading onward
[1485.84 → 1489.84] To thy glorious
[1489.84 → 1493.84] Rest of love
[1493.84 → 1496.84] O the deep
[1496.84 → 1500.84] Deep love of Jesus
[1500.84 → 1503.84] Spread his grace
[1504.68 → 1507.84] From shore to shore
[1507.84 → 1512.38] How he loves us
[1512.38 → 1515.98] Never loves us
[1515.98 → 1518.80] Changes never
[1518.80 → 1521.80] Nevermore
[1521.80 → 1525.80] How he watches
[1525.80 → 1530.80] For his loved ones
[1530.80 → 1534.54] Died to call them
[1534.54 → 1538.50] On his own
[1538.50 → 1540.50] How for them
[1540.50 → 1545.50] He's interceding
[1545.50 → 1549.50] Marching over them
[1549.50 → 1552.50] From afar
[1552.50 → 1557.04] O the deep
[1557.04 → 1561.46] Deep love of Jesus

[1603.38 → 1606.38] Up to glory
[1606.38 → 1610.38] For it lifts me
[1610.38 → 1614.38] Up to thee
[1614.38 → 1626.34] The children are dismissed
[1626.34 → 1627.72] Now for kids life
[1627.72 → 1631.34] Ages 3 through grade 5
[1631.34 → 1660.60] This morning I'll be reading from Malachi
[1660.60 → 1662.32] Malachi 1
[1662.32 → 1663.64] 6-14
[1663.64 → 1667.10] A son honours his father
[1667.10 → 1669.08] And a slave his master
[1669.08 → 1671.06] If I am a father
[1671.06 → 1672.92] Where is the honour due me
[1672.92 → 1674.88] If I am a master
[1674.88 → 1677.08] Where is the respect due me
[1677.08 → 1678.44] Says the Lord Almighty
[1678.44 → 1680.40] It is your priests
[1680.40 → 1681.42] Who show contempt
[1681.42 → 1682.18] For your name
[1682.18 → 1684.44] But you ask
[1684.44 → 1685.90] How have we shown contempt
[1685.90 → 1686.78] For your name
[1686.78 → 1689.90] By offering defiled food
[1689.90 → 1690.86] On my altar
[1690.86 → 1692.54] But you ask
[1692.54 → 1694.16] How have we defiled you
[1694.16 → 1696.56] By saying the Lord's table
[1696.56 → 1697.60] Is contemptible
[1697.60 → 1699.98] When you offer blind animals
[1699.98 → 1700.96] For sacrifice
[1700.96 → 1702.46] Is it not wrong
[1702.46 → 1705.10] When you sacrifice lame
[1705.10 → 1706.38] Or diseased animals
[1706.38 → 1707.88] Is that not wrong
[1707.88 → 1709.96] Try offering them
[1709.96 → 1710.66] To your governor
[1710.66 → 1712.56] Would he be pleased with you
[1712.56 → 1714.38] Would he accept you
[1714.38 → 1715.78] Says the Lord Almighty
[1715.78 → 1718.56] Now plead with God
[1718.56 → 1719.96] To be gracious to us
[1719.96 → 1721.44] With such offerings
[1721.44 → 1722.40] From your hands
[1722.40 → 1724.06] Will he accept you
[1724.06 → 1725.60] Says the Lord Almighty
[1725.60 → 1728.52] Oh that one of you
[1728.52 → 1730.14] Would shut the temple doors
[1730.14 → 1731.42] So that you would not
[1731.42 → 1732.82] Light useless fires
[1732.82 → 1733.82] On my altar
[1733.82 → 1736.36] I am not pleased with you
[1736.36 → 1737.62] Says the Lord Almighty
[1737.62 → 1739.90] I will accept no offering
[1739.90 → 1740.80] From your hands
[1740.80 → 1743.00] My name will be great
[1743.00 → 1743.98] Among the nations
[1743.98 → 1746.28] From where the sun shines
[1746.28 → 1747.62] To where it sets
[1747.62 → 1749.20] In every place
[1749.20 → 1751.02] Incense and pure offerings
[1751.02 → 1752.08] Will be brought to me
[1752.08 → 1754.44] Because my name will be great
[1754.44 → 1755.56] Among the nations
[1755.56 → 1757.12] Says the Lord Almighty
[1757.12 → 1759.34] But you profane it
[1759.34 → 1759.96] By saying
[1759.96 → 1761.00] The Lord's table
[1761.00 → 1761.76] Is defiled
[1761.76 → 1763.34] And its food
[1763.34 → 1764.22] Is contemptible
[1764.22 → 1765.44] And you say
[1765.44 → 1767.80] By what burden
[1767.80 → 1769.90] And you sniff at it
[1769.90 → 1770.70] Contemptuously
[1770.70 → 1772.06] Says the Lord Almighty
[1772.06 → 1774.20] When you bring injured
[1774.20 → 1776.22] Lame or diseased animals
[1776.22 → 1777.28] And offer them
[1777.28 → 1778.24] As sacrifice
[1778.24 → 1779.68] Should I accept them
[1779.68 → 1780.42] From your hands
[1780.42 → 1781.32] Says the Lord
[1781.32 → 1783.54] Cursed is the cheat
[1783.54 → 1785.12] Who has an acceptable male
[1785.12 → 1785.92] In his flock
[1785.92 → 1787.56] And vows to give it
[1787.56 → 1788.82] But then sacrifices
[1788.82 → 1790.00] A blemished animal
[1790.00 → 1790.70] To the Lord
[1790.70 → 1792.92] For I am a great king
[1792.92 → 1794.18] Says the Lord Almighty
[1794.18 → 1796.04] And my name to be feared
[1796.04 → 1797.10] Among the nations
[1797.10 → 1799.42] This is the word of the Lord
[1799.42 → 1801.22] Thanks be to God
[1801.22 → 1811.74] Good morning
[1811.74 → 1814.88] Yes and so we
[1814.88 → 1816.64] As has been mentioned
[1816.64 → 1817.46] Already this morning
[1817.46 → 1818.96] We are in the church season
[1818.96 → 1819.60] Of Lent
[1819.60 → 1821.16] And during this season
[1821.16 → 1822.62] We're looking at the book
[1822.62 → 1823.84] Of Malachi
[1823.84 → 1826.00] So Malachi
[1826.00 → 1827.38] He was a prophet
[1827.38 → 1829.50] Sent by God
[1829.50 → 1831.62] To the people of God
[1831.62 → 1833.74] The people of Israel
[1833.74 → 1836.18] And he had sent this to them
[1836.18 → 1837.76] After they returned home
[1837.76 → 1839.48] From exile in Babylon
[1839.48 → 1845.04] And so
[1845.04 → 1847.08] The God's people
[1847.08 → 1847.56] The Israelites
[1847.56 → 1848.74] They were in exile in Babylon
[1848.74 → 1851.44] But they had returned home
[1851.44 → 1854.00] And though they had returned home
[1854.00 → 1854.94] To the land
[1854.94 → 1855.90] They are in Judah
[1855.90 → 1859.82] They hadn't returned to God
[1859.82 → 1861.78] And that's because
[1861.78 → 1863.76] When they looked around
[1863.76 → 1864.94] At their circumstances
[1864.94 → 1866.94] What they saw
[1866.94 → 1868.60] Was economic decline
[1868.60 → 1870.64] They saw that they were
[1870.64 → 1872.08] Under Persian rule
[1872.08 → 1874.14] And that the temple
[1874.14 → 1876.20] Was only a shadow
[1876.20 → 1877.76] Of its former glory
[1877.76 → 1880.04] When they looked around them
[1880.04 → 1882.50] It just seemed like
[1882.50 → 1884.48] God didn't really care
[1884.48 → 1885.00] About them
[1885.00 → 1887.00] So last week
[1887.00 → 1888.26] We looked at the first message
[1888.26 → 1889.34] God gave to his people
[1889.34 → 1890.36] Which is that
[1890.36 → 1892.52] Even though they didn't feel it
[1892.52 → 1894.24] God still loves them
[1894.24 → 1895.94] And it's because
[1895.94 → 1896.98] He loves his people
[1896.98 → 1898.74] That he wants them
[1898.74 → 1900.18] To return to him
[1900.18 → 1901.84] To live as his people
[1901.84 → 1903.12] To be a holy nation
[1903.12 → 1904.18] To be a people
[1904.18 → 1905.38] Belonging to God
[1905.38 → 1907.86] And he wants to heal his people
[1907.86 → 1909.82] He wants to renew his people
[1909.82 → 1911.64] And that's why
[1911.64 → 1912.76] The remainder of the book
[1912.76 → 1913.32] Of Malachi
[1913.32 → 1915.70] After God affirms
[1915.70 → 1916.50] His love for them
[1916.50 → 1918.02] God has
[1918.02 → 1919.80] Some complaints
[1919.80 → 1921.28] Against his people
[1921.28 → 1923.92] He has some pretty
[1923.92 → 1925.06] Serious issues
[1925.06 → 1927.08] That he wants to deal with
[1927.08 → 1928.38] With his people
[1928.38 → 1929.98] And God's goal
[1929.98 → 1931.04] Is that his people
[1931.04 → 1932.12] Would return to him
[1932.12 → 1933.32] In their hearts
[1933.32 → 1934.58] And in their lives
[1934.58 → 1936.80] And so it makes sense
[1936.80 → 1937.58] That the first thing
[1937.58 → 1938.26] God addresses
[1938.26 → 1939.30] With his people
[1939.30 → 1941.60] Is their worship
[1941.60 → 1944.02] And this is a good passage
[1944.02 → 1944.72] For us this morning
[1944.72 → 1945.18] Isn't it
[1945.18 → 1946.10] Because
[1946.10 → 1948.10] This is what we are
[1948.10 → 1948.92] Doing right here
[1948.92 → 1950.40] We're coming into
[1950.40 → 1951.20] The Lord's presence
[1951.20 → 1952.40] And we are
[1952.40 → 1953.14] Worshipping him
[1953.14 → 1954.60] And so this passage
[1954.60 → 1955.62] Can help us this morning
[1955.62 → 1956.24] To know
[1956.24 → 1957.76] How we might
[1957.76 → 1959.62] Rightly glorify God
[1959.62 → 1961.20] And worship him
[1961.20 → 1963.02] And to honour him
[1963.02 → 1963.58] In our worship
[1963.58 → 1965.16] And so before we get
[1965.16 → 1965.74] Into the passage
[1965.74 → 1966.28] Let's stop
[1966.28 → 1967.06] Let's pray together
[1967.06 → 1969.22] Please pray with me
[1969.22 → 1971.98] Mighty Father in heaven
[1971.98 → 1973.54] We ask that you would now
[1973.54 → 1975.56] Send your Holy Spirit
[1975.56 → 1977.32] The Spirit of God
[1977.32 → 1978.06] That was
[1978.06 → 1979.88] Brought forth
[1979.88 → 1980.94] All creation
[1980.94 → 1982.84] The Spirit of God
[1982.84 → 1983.98] That renews
[1983.98 → 1985.18] Your people
[1985.18 → 1986.76] And brings things to life
[1986.76 → 1987.80] Where there was no life
[1987.80 → 1988.90] Lord would your Spirit
[1988.90 → 1990.90] Cause in us
[1990.90 → 1991.98] In our hearts
[1991.98 → 1992.32] Lord
[1992.32 → 1993.96] To honour
[1993.96 → 1995.48] And to worship
[1995.48 → 1996.20] You this morning
[1996.20 → 1997.68] And may the words
[1997.68 → 1998.98] Of my mouth
[1998.98 → 1999.84] And the meditations
[1999.84 → 2001.00] Of all of our hearts
[2001.00 → 2002.52] Lord be pleasing
[2002.52 → 2003.22] In your sight
[2003.22 → 2004.62] Oh Lord
[2004.62 → 2005.10] Our rock
[2005.10 → 2005.66] And our redeemer
[2005.66 → 2006.88] We pray in Jesus name
[2006.88 → 2007.78] Amen
[2007.78 → 2010.38] So when I was growing up
[2010.38 → 2011.78] My home church
[2011.78 → 2012.56] Was called
[2012.56 → 2013.94] The First Congregational Church
[2013.94 → 2014.92] Of Woodstock, Vermont
[2014.92 → 2018.14] And at our church
[2018.14 → 2020.14] During the regular school year
[2020.14 → 2021.94] It would be
[2021.94 → 2023.22] Kind of traditional
[2023.22 → 2024.50] Formal
[2024.50 → 2025.32] Kind of worship
[2025.32 → 2026.40] And so my parents
[2026.40 → 2027.04] Would make me
[2027.04 → 2028.04] Dress nicely
[2028.04 → 2028.56] I remember
[2028.56 → 2029.94] My mom struggling
[2029.94 → 2030.70] With my sister
[2030.70 → 2031.90] To get her to wear a dress
[2031.90 → 2033.28] And hearing from
[2033.28 → 2033.90] Her room
[2033.90 → 2035.18] Screaming and crying
[2035.18 → 2037.18] But you know
[2037.18 → 2038.48] We had to look nice
[2038.48 → 2039.36] For church
[2039.36 → 2041.02] But in the summers
[2041.02 → 2042.62] In the summers
[2042.62 → 2044.14] We could wear shorts
[2044.14 → 2045.48] Summers
[2045.48 → 2046.34] School was out
[2046.34 → 2048.02] The service moved
[2048.02 → 2048.82] A little bit later
[2048.82 → 2051.78] And it was casual
[2051.78 → 2053.34] Casual worship
[2053.34 → 2054.82] And so
[2054.82 → 2056.90] I was trying to think
[2056.90 → 2057.92] What does it mean
[2057.92 → 2058.70] To be casual
[2058.70 → 2059.26] In worship
[2059.26 → 2061.68] Well I looked up
[2061.68 → 2062.38] The word casual
[2062.38 → 2063.08] In the dictionary
[2063.08 → 2065.38] And here's one definition
[2065.38 → 2066.32] Of the word casual
[2066.32 → 2068.86] It means to be
[2068.86 → 2070.06] Without formality
[2070.06 → 2070.76] Of style
[2070.76 → 2072.66] And that's what
[2072.66 → 2073.78] It meant
[2073.78 → 2074.72] To be casual
[2074.72 → 2076.64] In my home church
[2076.64 → 2077.48] During the summers
[2077.48 → 2079.44] It was hot
[2079.44 → 2080.10] In the summers
[2080.10 → 2081.36] Even though it's Vermont
[2081.36 → 2082.10] It's kind of cold
[2082.10 → 2082.82] But in the summers
[2082.82 → 2084.08] It would get really hot
[2084.08 → 2085.16] But like here
[2085.16 → 2085.98] We don't have
[2085.98 → 2087.10] Air conditioning often
[2087.10 → 2088.70] And so in the summers
[2088.70 → 2090.14] It was just too hot
[2090.14 → 2091.64] To be here
[2091.64 → 2092.46] Gathered in worship
[2092.46 → 2093.36] And so we said
[2093.36 → 2095.08] Let's not dress formally
[2095.08 → 2096.34] It's too hot for that
[2096.34 → 2097.88] And as Christians
[2097.88 → 2099.56] We have freedom
[2099.56 → 2101.16] In these sorts of things
[2101.16 → 2102.78] But now there's
[2102.78 → 2103.72] A second definition
[2103.72 → 2104.62] Of the word casual
[2104.62 → 2105.86] In the dictionary
[2105.86 → 2107.50] It also means
[2107.50 → 2108.66] To be relaxed
[2108.66 → 2111.04] And unconcerned
[2111.04 → 2112.98] And when it comes
[2112.98 → 2113.42] To worship
[2113.42 → 2114.30] This definition
[2114.30 → 2114.92] Of casual
[2114.92 → 2115.72] Strikes me
[2115.72 → 2117.72] As more of a problem
[2117.72 → 2118.44] For us
[2118.44 → 2120.52] Casual can mean
[2120.52 → 2122.22] That I'm just kind of
[2122.22 → 2124.02] Strolling into God's presence
[2124.02 → 2125.80] Maybe like I would go
[2125.80 → 2126.58] For a coffee
[2126.58 → 2127.76] Or in the summer
[2127.76 → 2128.60] A Frappuccino
[2128.60 → 2129.30] At Starbucks
[2129.30 → 2130.14] Right?
[2130.20 → 2131.42] I stroll into Starbucks
[2131.42 → 2132.62] To get my coffee
[2132.62 → 2135.44] To meet my caffeine needs
[2135.44 → 2137.62] And I stroll into worship
[2137.62 → 2140.36] To get my spiritual needs met
[2140.36 → 2143.08] And in a sense
[2143.08 → 2144.06] When we approach worship
[2144.06 → 2145.18] In that casual way
[2145.18 → 2147.62] It's not so much
[2147.62 → 2148.50] That we are there
[2148.50 → 2149.68] With a high view
[2149.68 → 2150.28] Of God
[2150.28 → 2150.90] But rather
[2150.90 → 2152.54] It's having a high view
[2152.54 → 2153.30] Of ourselves
[2153.30 → 2155.58] And that's the attitude
[2155.58 → 2156.30] Towards worship
[2156.30 → 2156.96] That Malachi
[2156.96 → 2158.54] Is going to challenge us
[2158.54 → 2159.20] With today
[2159.20 → 2160.82] And we see this
[2160.82 → 2162.14] Especially in the last sentence
[2162.14 → 2162.80] Of our passage
[2162.80 → 2163.72] In verse 14
[2163.72 → 2164.92] God says
[2164.92 → 2166.44] For I am
[2166.44 → 2168.12] A great king
[2168.12 → 2170.64] Says the Lord Almighty
[2170.64 → 2172.76] My name is to be feared
[2172.76 → 2173.82] Among the nations
[2173.82 → 2176.10] And so if we really understand
[2176.10 → 2177.42] What we are doing this morning
[2177.42 → 2179.32] That we are appearing
[2179.32 → 2180.64] Even now
[2180.64 → 2182.66] Before the great king
[2182.66 → 2184.44] In his presence
[2184.44 → 2186.12] We wouldn't describe
[2186.12 → 2186.78] Our worship
[2186.78 → 2188.22] As relaxed
[2188.22 → 2189.78] And unconcerned
[2189.78 → 2190.18] Would we?
[2190.76 → 2191.02] Right?
[2191.06 → 2191.86] We would realize
[2191.86 → 2192.72] That we are becoming
[2192.72 → 2193.80] Before a holy
[2193.80 → 2195.50] And an awesome God
[2195.50 → 2197.46] And so this morning
[2197.46 → 2198.56] There are two challenges
[2198.56 → 2199.88] About worship
[2199.88 → 2200.42] From Malachi
[2200.42 → 2201.16] For us
[2201.16 → 2203.00] Two important challenges
[2203.00 → 2204.48] And this is what they are
[2204.48 → 2205.32] That worship
[2205.32 → 2207.02] Should be reverent
[2207.02 → 2208.42] And that worship
[2208.42 → 2210.06] Should be sacrificial
[2210.06 → 2211.28] Okay so worship
[2211.28 → 2212.18] Two important things
[2212.18 → 2213.46] Worship should be reverent
[2213.46 → 2214.74] And sacrificial
[2214.74 → 2216.90] And these are good things
[2216.90 → 2218.60] Sometimes we think
[2218.60 → 2219.16] Reverent
[2219.16 → 2220.26] Or sacrificial
[2220.26 → 2221.14] Right?
[2221.24 → 2222.18] That seems like
[2222.18 → 2223.42] You know
[2223.42 → 2224.08] That's going to take
[2224.08 → 2224.92] Something from us
[2224.92 → 2225.42] That's going to
[2225.42 → 2226.56] That's going to challenge us
[2226.56 → 2226.98] We're going to have to
[2226.98 → 2227.76] Give of ourselves
[2227.76 → 2229.16] But what we find
[2229.16 → 2229.76] In the Bible
[2229.76 → 2230.74] Is that when we worship
[2230.74 → 2231.64] God in this way
[2231.64 → 2232.92] Reverently
[2232.92 → 2233.72] Sacrificially
[2233.72 → 2234.94] We find joy
[2234.94 → 2236.54] We find true joy
[2236.54 → 2237.92] Because that is what
[2237.92 → 2239.20] We were created for
[2239.20 → 2240.40] And so first
[2240.40 → 2241.24] Let's look at this first
[2241.24 → 2242.24] This first point
[2242.24 → 2243.52] That worship
[2243.52 → 2244.66] Should be reverent
[2244.66 → 2246.08] Now if you look at
[2246.08 → 2246.60] Verse 6
[2246.60 → 2247.06] And I hope
[2247.06 → 2247.30] You know
[2247.30 → 2248.32] Get your Bibles out
[2248.32 → 2249.58] We'll have it on the screen
[2249.58 → 2250.66] But I do want you to
[2250.66 → 2251.46] Follow along
[2251.46 → 2252.78] In one way or another
[2252.78 → 2254.46] In your bulletin
[2254.46 → 2254.70] Actually
[2254.70 → 2255.88] We print in the order
[2255.88 → 2256.28] Of worship
[2256.28 → 2257.26] The page number
[2257.26 → 2259.48] So that you can
[2259.48 → 2260.10] Find it easier
[2260.10 → 2261.58] And I didn't announce that
[2261.58 → 2262.42] But
[2262.42 → 2263.26] So you can look
[2263.26 → 2263.68] In your Bibles
[2263.68 → 2264.08] Malachi
[2264.08 → 2265.96] Chapter 1
[2265.96 → 2267.26] But look at verse 6
[2267.26 → 2269.20] So here is what God says
[2269.20 → 2269.56] God
[2269.56 → 2270.56] He kind of states
[2270.56 → 2271.12] This proverb
[2271.12 → 2273.12] Or it's kind of like
[2273.12 → 2274.42] A common sense
[2274.42 → 2275.28] Understanding
[2275.28 → 2276.08] Of the world
[2276.08 → 2277.00] And he says this
[2277.00 → 2278.84] A son honours his father
[2278.84 → 2280.76] And a slave his master
[2280.76 → 2283.50] And God says
[2283.50 → 2285.74] You all know that
[2285.74 → 2287.66] And the Israelites
[2287.66 → 2288.30] Would say
[2288.30 → 2289.10] Yeah
[2289.10 → 2289.74] Right
[2289.74 → 2291.70] That is how the world works
[2291.70 → 2292.66] If you're a son
[2292.66 → 2293.80] You honour your father
[2293.80 → 2294.70] If you are a master
[2294.70 → 2295.98] Or if you are a servant
[2295.98 → 2297.66] You honour your master
[2297.66 → 2298.96] That's normal
[2298.96 → 2299.86] We get that
[2299.86 → 2301.44] But then God says
[2301.44 → 2302.22] Continuing on
[2302.22 → 2302.82] In verse 6
[2302.82 → 2304.32] If that is how
[2304.32 → 2305.30] The world works
[2305.30 → 2306.44] And you all know it
[2306.44 → 2307.56] Then if I am a father
[2307.56 → 2308.74] Where is the honour due me?
[2309.50 → 2310.72] If I am a master
[2310.72 → 2311.88] Where is the respect
[2311.88 → 2312.62] Due me
[2312.62 → 2313.58] Says the Lord Almighty
[2313.58 → 2315.02] So God's complaint
[2315.02 → 2315.70] Is very simple
[2315.70 → 2318.00] I am not being treated
[2318.00 → 2319.56] Like God
[2319.56 → 2321.98] The people are not
[2321.98 → 2323.36] Honouring God as father
[2323.36 → 2324.74] They are not
[2324.74 → 2326.28] Serving him
[2326.28 → 2327.76] As their master
[2327.76 → 2329.66] And now when we talk
[2329.66 → 2330.56] About God as father
[2330.56 → 2331.80] For many of us
[2331.80 → 2332.94] When you become a Christian
[2332.94 → 2334.08] You realize that
[2334.08 → 2335.04] You have this new
[2335.04 → 2336.12] Loving father
[2336.12 → 2338.08] And he
[2338.08 → 2338.82] He's a God
[2338.82 → 2339.92] Who welcomes us
[2339.92 → 2341.20] He embraces us
[2341.20 → 2341.98] As his father
[2341.98 → 2343.46] And this is an important
[2343.46 → 2345.08] Part of our spiritual lives
[2345.08 → 2346.68] And one of my
[2346.68 → 2347.86] Favourite children's books
[2347.86 → 2348.50] Is
[2348.50 → 2349.42] The Princess
[2349.42 → 2350.40] And the Goblin
[2350.40 → 2351.88] By George MacDonald
[2351.88 → 2353.12] Has anybody ever read that?
[2354.00 → 2354.90] It's an older book
[2354.90 → 2355.44] One person
[2355.44 → 2356.20] Okay good
[2356.20 → 2358.64] Well there's a
[2358.64 → 2359.14] It's about
[2359.14 → 2360.14] It's a story about
[2360.14 → 2361.14] A young princess
[2361.14 → 2362.46] Named Irene
[2362.46 → 2364.18] And I want to
[2364.18 → 2364.90] Read you a passage
[2364.90 → 2365.56] From the book
[2365.56 → 2366.86] This is what it says
[2366.86 → 2369.86] One splendid
[2369.86 → 2371.84] Sunshiny day
[2371.84 → 2373.48] About an hour
[2373.48 → 2374.24] After noon
[2374.24 → 2375.50] Irene who was playing
[2375.50 → 2376.36] On a lawn
[2376.36 → 2376.92] In the garden
[2376.92 → 2378.82] Heard the distant
[2378.82 → 2380.14] Blast of a bugle
[2380.14 → 2382.04] She jumped up
[2382.04 → 2383.28] With a cry of joy
[2383.28 → 2384.50] For she knew
[2384.50 → 2385.98] By that particular blast
[2385.98 → 2387.16] That her father
[2387.16 → 2388.78] Was on his way
[2388.78 → 2389.54] To see her
[2389.54 → 2391.90] She looked far away
[2391.90 → 2393.38] To catch the first glimpse
[2393.38 → 2394.46] Of shining armour
[2394.46 → 2396.18] Her little heart
[2396.18 → 2397.32] Be faster and faster
[2397.32 → 2398.80] As the shining troop
[2398.80 → 2399.46] Approached
[2399.46 → 2400.88] For she loved
[2400.88 → 2401.60] Her King Papa
[2401.60 → 2402.46] Very dearly
[2402.46 → 2404.00] And was nowhere
[2404.00 → 2404.94] So happy
[2404.94 → 2406.56] As in his arms
[2406.56 → 2408.26] When they reached
[2408.26 → 2409.00] A certain point
[2409.00 → 2410.26] She ran to the gate
[2410.26 → 2411.34] And there stood
[2411.34 → 2412.52] Till up they came
[2412.52 → 2413.60] Clamping
[2413.60 → 2414.54] And stamping
[2414.54 → 2416.04] With one more
[2416.04 → 2417.26] Bright bugle blast
[2417.26 → 2417.96] Which said
[2417.96 → 2418.68] Irene
[2418.68 → 2420.22] I have come
[2420.22 → 2422.16] By this time
[2422.16 → 2422.72] All the people
[2422.72 → 2423.30] Were gathered
[2423.30 → 2424.02] At the gate
[2424.02 → 2425.60] But Irene stood
[2425.60 → 2426.98] Alone in front of them
[2426.98 → 2428.82] When the horsemen
[2428.82 → 2429.34] Pulled up
[2429.34 → 2430.54] She ran to the side
[2430.54 → 2431.58] Of the white horse
[2431.58 → 2432.82] And held up her arms
[2432.82 → 2434.96] The king stopped
[2434.96 → 2436.36] And took her hands
[2436.36 → 2438.08] In an instant
[2438.08 → 2440.02] She was on the saddle
[2440.02 → 2441.28] And clasped
[2441.28 → 2442.44] In his great
[2442.44 → 2443.56] Strong arms
[2443.56 → 2445.38] And Irene sat
[2445.38 → 2446.16] On the saddle
[2446.16 → 2448.56] And hid her glad face
[2448.56 → 2450.72] Upon his bosom
[2450.72 → 2453.28] I think it's such
[2453.28 → 2454.26] A beautiful picture
[2454.26 → 2456.10] And I think it's a picture
[2456.10 → 2457.58] Of how God is
[2457.58 → 2458.22] As our father
[2458.22 → 2459.84] He is our
[2459.84 → 2460.74] King Papa
[2460.74 → 2462.74] He welcomes us
[2462.74 → 2463.88] He embraces us
[2463.88 → 2465.54] He takes joy in us
[2465.54 → 2467.88] God is intimate with us
[2467.88 → 2469.42] He protects us
[2469.42 → 2470.72] He delights in us
[2470.72 → 2472.50] But also
[2472.50 → 2473.42] When the Bible
[2473.42 → 2474.32] Talks about
[2474.32 → 2475.86] The relationship
[2475.86 → 2476.78] Of a father
[2476.78 → 2477.54] And a child
[2477.54 → 2478.68] There's another aspect
[2478.68 → 2479.56] Of that relationship
[2479.56 → 2481.12] Which is that
[2481.12 → 2481.98] It talks also
[2481.98 → 2482.54] In terms
[2482.54 → 2483.64] Of honour
[2483.64 → 2484.92] Right
[2484.92 → 2485.28] What do the
[2485.28 → 2486.14] Ten commandments say
[2486.14 → 2487.66] Honour
[2487.66 → 2489.00] Your father
[2489.00 → 2489.68] And your mother
[2489.68 → 2491.36] And the Lord
[2491.36 → 2492.20] Asks his people
[2492.20 → 2493.04] In this passage
[2493.04 → 2495.08] Where is my honour
[2495.08 → 2496.70] As your father
[2496.70 → 2498.80] Because as much
[2498.80 → 2499.58] As God is
[2499.58 → 2500.58] Our loving father
[2500.58 → 2501.52] And that is true
[2501.52 → 2502.80] He is also
[2502.80 → 2503.44] A father
[2503.44 → 2504.90] Who deserves
[2504.90 → 2506.26] Our honour
[2506.26 → 2508.30] And this is something
[2508.30 → 2509.06] We need to remember
[2509.06 → 2510.38] When we come to church
[2510.38 → 2511.78] On the one hand
[2511.78 → 2512.36] Like church
[2512.36 → 2513.10] This is a place
[2513.10 → 2513.58] Where we want
[2513.58 → 2514.44] People to come
[2514.44 → 2515.40] We want everyone
[2515.40 → 2516.18] To feel welcome
[2516.18 → 2517.10] We want everyone
[2517.10 → 2517.76] To feel like
[2517.76 → 2518.80] They can have
[2518.80 → 2520.04] Friends here
[2520.04 → 2521.42] There should be
[2521.42 → 2522.24] A cheerfulness
[2522.24 → 2523.44] To church
[2523.44 → 2525.46] But there should also
[2525.46 → 2526.28] Be a recognition
[2526.28 → 2527.46] That when we come here
[2527.46 → 2528.56] We are coming
[2528.56 → 2529.98] Before almighty God
[2529.98 → 2531.66] You know
[2531.66 → 2533.72] In Hebrews chapter 12
[2533.72 → 2535.52] It tells us
[2535.52 → 2536.82] That right now
[2536.82 → 2539.80] We are worshipping God
[2539.80 → 2541.14] In the spiritual realm
[2541.14 → 2542.80] Even now
[2542.80 → 2543.30] In this
[2543.30 → 2544.24] The unseen
[2544.24 → 2545.10] Spiritual realm
[2545.10 → 2546.54] That we are worshipping
[2546.54 → 2547.90] With thousands
[2547.90 → 2549.14] Upon thousands
[2549.14 → 2550.18] Of angels
[2550.18 → 2551.48] In joyful assembly
[2551.48 → 2553.42] And that we are
[2553.42 → 2554.24] Actually standing
[2554.24 → 2555.44] Before the great judge
[2555.44 → 2556.78] Of the whole earth
[2556.78 → 2559.14] It's amazing
[2559.14 → 2559.96] We don't
[2559.96 → 2560.64] It's so often
[2560.64 → 2561.70] I don't think about that
[2561.70 → 2563.38] But that's what
[2563.38 → 2563.98] The bible says
[2563.98 → 2565.18] And we can't see it
[2565.18 → 2566.42] But it's by faith
[2566.42 → 2567.08] That we believe
[2567.08 → 2567.74] That we are
[2567.74 → 2568.58] In God's presence
[2568.58 → 2570.72] And if we are
[2570.72 → 2571.58] In God's presence
[2571.58 → 2572.88] There should be
[2572.88 → 2573.70] A sense
[2573.70 → 2574.46] That we are
[2574.46 → 2575.36] Coming here
[2575.36 → 2576.86] With reverence
[2576.86 → 2578.64] He's the great
[2578.64 → 2579.78] King of the world
[2579.78 → 2580.98] We are in his presence
[2580.98 → 2582.68] He is our loving father
[2582.68 → 2584.12] But we come
[2584.12 → 2584.96] With reverence
[2584.96 → 2586.52] And respect
[2586.52 → 2588.50] Now that may
[2588.50 → 2589.86] Raise a question
[2589.86 → 2590.48] In our minds
[2590.48 → 2592.06] Does a sense
[2592.06 → 2592.76] Of reverence
[2592.76 → 2593.56] Make God
[2593.56 → 2594.46] Unapproachable
[2594.46 → 2595.50] Right
[2595.50 → 2595.98] Some of us
[2595.98 → 2596.38] Might think
[2596.38 → 2597.00] Like you know
[2597.00 → 2598.18] Fear and reverence
[2598.18 → 2598.64] Of God
[2598.64 → 2599.30] I don't want to
[2599.30 → 2599.74] Think of God
[2599.74 → 2600.18] That way
[2600.18 → 2601.88] But the amazing
[2601.88 → 2602.86] Thing about the gospel
[2602.86 → 2604.46] Is that the gospel
[2604.46 → 2605.14] Tells us
[2605.14 → 2606.10] That Jesus
[2606.10 → 2607.40] Cleanses us
[2607.40 → 2608.02] From our sin
[2608.02 → 2609.88] He is the one
[2609.88 → 2611.16] That qualifies us
[2611.16 → 2612.20] To worship God
[2612.20 → 2613.26] To come before
[2613.26 → 2613.88] His presence
[2613.88 → 2615.32] And so
[2615.32 → 2616.54] We can approach
[2616.54 → 2617.02] God
[2617.02 → 2618.38] The holy God
[2618.38 → 2619.08] Even though we are
[2619.08 → 2619.52] Sinners
[2619.52 → 2620.84] In Jesus Christ
[2620.84 → 2622.22] But
[2622.22 → 2623.10] That doesn't make
[2623.10 → 2623.48] God
[2623.48 → 2624.32] You know
[2624.32 → 2625.40] A Santa Claus
[2625.40 → 2626.06] That just does
[2626.06 → 2626.48] What we want
[2626.48 → 2626.94] It doesn't make
[2626.94 → 2627.64] Him a teddy bear
[2627.64 → 2628.68] We come before
[2628.68 → 2629.00] Him
[2629.00 → 2629.80] And He is
[2629.80 → 2630.28] The holy
[2630.28 → 2631.22] Almighty God
[2631.22 → 2632.58] Of the universe
[2632.58 → 2634.30] So coming into
[2634.30 → 2634.80] His presence
[2634.80 → 2635.44] Should not be
[2635.44 → 2636.54] Just an experience
[2636.54 → 2637.64] That is relaxed
[2637.64 → 2638.76] And unconcerned
[2638.76 → 2638.96] Right
[2638.96 → 2640.22] We don't come here
[2640.22 → 2641.10] To worship God
[2641.10 → 2641.76] Like we're getting
[2641.76 → 2642.50] Our Starbucks
[2642.50 → 2644.52] But there should
[2644.52 → 2645.22] Be a sense
[2645.22 → 2645.86] Of thrill
[2645.86 → 2647.68] It's amazing
[2647.68 → 2648.68] That me
[2648.68 → 2649.36] A sinner
[2649.36 → 2650.38] Could actually
[2650.38 → 2651.14] Come and be
[2651.14 → 2652.00] Loved and embraced
[2652.00 → 2652.58] By the king
[2652.58 → 2653.22] Of the universe
[2653.22 → 2655.44] That should
[2655.44 → 2656.60] Thrill my heart
[2656.60 → 2658.54] And so
[2658.54 → 2659.12] When we talk
[2659.12 → 2659.96] About reverence
[2659.96 → 2661.40] It doesn't mean
[2661.40 → 2661.94] Sad
[2661.94 → 2662.60] Right
[2662.60 → 2663.14] Reverence
[2663.14 → 2663.72] Should not mean
[2663.72 → 2664.16] Sad
[2664.16 → 2665.68] Reverence
[2665.68 → 2666.30] Should not be
[2666.30 → 2667.12] Oppressive
[2667.12 → 2668.22] That's not
[2668.22 → 2668.94] What reverence
[2668.94 → 2669.46] Means
[2669.46 → 2670.98] Worship
[2670.98 → 2671.46] Should have
[2671.46 → 2671.74] A sense
[2671.74 → 2672.14] Of joy
[2672.14 → 2673.54] Sunday
[2673.54 → 2674.88] Even in the
[2674.88 → 2675.48] Season of Lent
[2675.48 → 2676.32] It's a day
[2676.32 → 2676.92] Of resurrection
[2676.92 → 2677.48] It's a day
[2677.48 → 2678.26] Of celebration
[2678.26 → 2680.04] Christ is risen
[2680.04 → 2680.82] Our sins
[2680.82 → 2681.38] Are forgiven
[2681.38 → 2683.32] We are made
[2683.32 → 2683.68] New
[2683.68 → 2685.88] And yet
[2685.88 → 2686.76] There is a certain
[2686.76 → 2687.90] Reverence to it
[2687.90 → 2689.26] C.S. Lewis
[2689.26 → 2690.04] Puts it this way
[2690.04 → 2691.98] He says
[2691.98 → 2692.84] Joy
[2692.84 → 2694.44] Is the serious
[2694.44 → 2695.36] Business of heaven
[2695.36 → 2699.82] It feels like
[2699.82 → 2700.42] There's a tension
[2700.42 → 2700.98] There right
[2700.98 → 2703.00] But joy
[2703.00 → 2704.60] Is serious
[2704.60 → 2705.12] Business
[2705.12 → 2707.62] Joy
[2707.62 → 2708.38] And reverence
[2708.38 → 2708.98] Go together
[2708.98 → 2710.70] But it is
[2710.70 → 2711.16] The kind
[2711.16 → 2711.74] Of joy
[2711.74 → 2713.08] That can
[2713.08 → 2713.80] Be missed
[2713.80 → 2714.74] If we approach
[2714.74 → 2715.68] God in a way
[2715.68 → 2717.00] That is relaxed
[2717.00 → 2718.18] And unconcerned
[2718.18 → 2719.60] If we do
[2719.60 → 2720.06] That
[2720.06 → 2721.38] We actually
[2721.38 → 2721.94] Miss out
[2721.94 → 2722.48] On the joy
[2722.48 → 2723.38] We miss our
[2723.38 → 2724.42] On the reverence
[2724.42 → 2725.92] Of the joy
[2725.92 → 2726.48] Of being
[2726.48 → 2728.04] Before a holy
[2728.04 → 2728.42] God
[2728.42 → 2730.58] So there should
[2730.58 → 2731.20] Be a reverence
[2731.20 → 2731.82] In our worship
[2731.82 → 2733.60] And that leads us
[2733.60 → 2734.36] To the second thing
[2734.36 → 2734.70] That we see
[2734.70 → 2735.34] In this passage
[2735.34 → 2736.12] That worship
[2736.12 → 2737.18] Should also be
[2737.18 → 2737.82] Sacrificial
[2737.82 → 2740.22] When we
[2740.22 → 2741.40] Realize
[2741.40 → 2742.76] That worship
[2742.76 → 2743.64] Is reverent
[2743.64 → 2744.66] That is going
[2744.66 → 2745.10] To lead us
[2745.10 → 2745.56] To realize
[2745.56 → 2746.28] That what we
[2746.28 → 2747.18] Offer God
[2747.18 → 2747.94] What we bring
[2747.94 → 2748.82] Before God
[2748.82 → 2750.10] Should be
[2750.10 → 2750.78] Sacrificial
[2750.78 → 2752.32] So look
[2752.32 → 2752.64] At verses
[2752.64 → 2753.14] Six to
[2753.14 → 2753.38] Eight
[2753.38 → 2754.12] In our passage
[2754.12 → 2755.52] So beginning
[2755.52 → 2756.00] In verse
[2756.00 → 2756.78] Six
[2756.78 → 2757.80] The kind
[2757.80 → 2758.14] Of the second
[2758.14 → 2758.60] Part of verse
[2758.60 → 2758.82] Six
[2758.82 → 2759.20] This is what
[2759.20 → 2759.58] It says
[2759.58 → 2761.48] It is you
[2761.48 → 2762.20] Priests
[2762.20 → 2762.90] Who show
[2762.90 → 2763.40] Contempt
[2763.40 → 2764.08] For my name
[2764.08 → 2765.10] But you ask
[2765.10 → 2765.88] How have we
[2765.88 → 2766.34] Shown contempt
[2766.34 → 2767.14] For your name
[2767.14 → 2768.54] God replies
[2768.54 → 2769.48] By offering
[2769.48 → 2770.32] Defiled food
[2770.32 → 2771.04] On my altar
[2771.04 → 2773.28] But you ask
[2773.28 → 2774.42] How have we
[2774.42 → 2775.20] Defiled you
[2775.20 → 2776.62] By saying
[2776.62 → 2777.24] That the Lord's
[2777.24 → 2777.80] Table is
[2777.80 → 2778.44] Contemptible
[2778.44 → 2778.90] When you
[2778.90 → 2779.50] Offer blind
[2779.50 → 2779.84] Animals
[2779.84 → 2780.62] For sacrifice
[2780.62 → 2781.30] Is that
[2781.30 → 2781.86] Not wrong
[2781.86 → 2782.56] When you
[2782.56 → 2783.48] Sacrifice lame
[2783.48 → 2784.06] Or diseased
[2784.06 → 2784.56] Animals
[2784.56 → 2785.42] Is that
[2785.42 → 2786.08] Not wrong
[2786.08 → 2787.90] Right
[2787.90 → 2788.68] All of this
[2788.68 → 2789.44] You know
[2789.44 → 2790.12] We read about
[2790.12 → 2790.86] In the Old
[2790.86 → 2791.16] Testament
[2791.16 → 2791.66] We read about
[2791.66 → 2792.46] Sacrifices
[2792.46 → 2792.94] We read about
[2792.94 → 2793.62] Offerings of
[2793.62 → 2794.08] Animals
[2794.08 → 2795.20] And that is
[2795.20 → 2795.86] So foreign
[2795.86 → 2796.90] To us
[2796.90 → 2797.30] Today
[2797.30 → 2797.94] But to the
[2797.94 → 2798.48] People of
[2798.48 → 2798.92] Israel
[2798.92 → 2800.04] The sacrificial
[2800.04 → 2800.78] System was
[2800.78 → 2801.52] The backbone
[2801.52 → 2802.24] And the very
[2802.24 → 2802.84] Heart
[2802.84 → 2803.88] Of their
[2803.88 → 2804.52] Relationship
[2804.52 → 2804.96] With God
[2804.96 → 2806.66] God had
[2806.66 → 2807.40] Commanded his
[2807.40 → 2807.96] People way
[2807.96 → 2808.48] Back in the
[2808.48 → 2809.00] Old Testament
[2809.00 → 2809.90] In the law
[2809.90 → 2810.70] He gave them
[2810.70 → 2811.58] The law
[2811.58 → 2812.92] And he said
[2812.92 → 2813.44] When you
[2813.44 → 2814.24] Worship me
[2814.24 → 2815.14] You are
[2815.14 → 2815.96] Supposed to
[2815.96 → 2816.92] Bring your
[2816.92 → 2817.46] Best
[2817.46 → 2818.78] When you
[2818.78 → 2819.36] Worship God
[2819.36 → 2819.56] When you
[2819.56 → 2820.32] Bring sacrifices
[2820.32 → 2820.78] To God
[2820.78 → 2821.52] You bring
[2821.52 → 2822.00] Your very
[2822.00 → 2822.42] Best
[2822.42 → 2824.12] And specifically
[2824.12 → 2824.88] They are told
[2824.88 → 2825.50] In the law
[2825.50 → 2826.54] A number of
[2826.54 → 2826.96] Times
[2826.96 → 2828.22] Don't bring
[2828.22 → 2828.62] Animals
[2828.62 → 2829.22] With defects
[2829.22 → 2830.40] Don't bring
[2830.40 → 2831.00] Animals that
[2831.00 → 2831.40] Are sick
[2831.40 → 2832.26] Don't bring
[2832.26 → 2832.84] Animals that
[2832.84 → 2833.12] Have been
[2833.12 → 2833.50] Killed
[2833.50 → 2834.78] By wild
[2834.78 → 2835.20] Animals
[2835.20 → 2835.46] When you
[2835.46 → 2835.94] Come before
[2835.94 → 2836.22] God
[2836.22 → 2836.58] You don't
[2836.58 → 2836.92] Bring
[2836.92 → 2837.70] Gruff
[2837.70 → 2838.14] The one
[2838.14 → 2838.46] Eyed
[2838.46 → 2838.82] Goat
[2838.82 → 2839.96] You bring
[2839.96 → 2841.14] Your spotless
[2841.14 → 2841.62] Perfect
[2841.62 → 2842.20] Beautiful
[2842.20 → 2842.52] Lamb
[2842.52 → 2843.42] The one
[2843.42 → 2843.74] That you
[2843.74 → 2844.24] Value
[2844.24 → 2844.84] And treasure
[2844.84 → 2845.24] The most
[2845.24 → 2845.56] The one
[2845.56 → 2846.02] That you've
[2846.02 → 2846.90] Cared for
[2846.90 → 2847.50] The most
[2847.50 → 2848.82] That is
[2848.82 → 2849.08] What you
[2849.08 → 2849.44] Bring
[2849.44 → 2850.74] Before God
[2850.74 → 2853.18] Why?
[2854.62 → 2855.22] Because
[2855.22 → 2856.14] They're supposed
[2856.14 → 2856.90] To give
[2856.90 → 2858.06] Their best
[2858.06 → 2859.26] And by
[2859.26 → 2859.58] Bringing
[2859.58 → 2860.20] Your best
[2860.20 → 2860.60] To God
[2860.60 → 2861.00] That is
[2861.00 → 2861.36] How you
[2861.36 → 2861.94] Showed
[2861.94 → 2862.26] That you
[2862.26 → 2862.72] Truly
[2862.72 → 2863.28] Honoured
[2863.28 → 2863.72] God
[2863.72 → 2864.98] And worshipped
[2864.98 → 2865.22] Him
[2865.22 → 2866.54] That's
[2866.54 → 2866.78] How you
[2866.78 → 2867.12] Showed
[2867.12 → 2867.40] God
[2867.40 → 2868.50] That you
[2868.50 → 2869.00] That you
[2869.00 → 2869.92] Honour him
[2869.92 → 2870.36] That you're
[2870.36 → 2870.84] Revered
[2870.84 → 2871.32] Before him
[2871.32 → 2871.74] You worship
[2871.74 → 2871.92] Him
[2871.92 → 2872.50] You bring
[2872.50 → 2872.88] Him
[2872.88 → 2874.24] Your best
[2874.24 → 2874.98] You don't
[2874.98 → 2875.56] Bring him
[2875.56 → 2876.62] The scraps
[2876.62 → 2877.54] Of the barrel
[2877.54 → 2879.36] But the
[2879.36 → 2879.84] Israelites
[2879.84 → 2880.62] In Malachi's
[2880.62 → 2881.00] Time
[2881.00 → 2881.78] They'd gotten
[2881.78 → 2882.36] Into this
[2882.36 → 2882.78] Habit
[2882.78 → 2883.18] And it was
[2883.18 → 2883.66] Approved
[2883.66 → 2884.02] By the
[2884.02 → 2884.44] Priests
[2884.44 → 2885.62] That they're
[2885.62 → 2885.92] Going to
[2885.92 → 2886.10] Bring
[2886.10 → 2886.42] Something
[2886.42 → 2886.80] Far
[2886.80 → 2887.42] Less
[2887.42 → 2888.16] Than
[2888.16 → 2888.70] Their best
[2888.70 → 2889.32] Far
[2889.32 → 2889.76] Less
[2889.76 → 2890.20] Than
[2890.20 → 2890.44] What
[2890.44 → 2890.90] Was
[2890.90 → 2891.74] Required
[2891.74 → 2893.58] The offerings
[2893.58 → 2894.02] They brought
[2894.02 → 2894.54] To God
[2894.54 → 2895.16] The great
[2895.16 → 2895.46] King
[2895.46 → 2895.70] Of the
[2895.70 → 2896.16] Universe
[2896.16 → 2897.88] Were blind
[2897.88 → 2899.16] Lame
[2899.16 → 2900.44] And diseased
[2900.44 → 2901.04] Animals
[2901.04 → 2902.64] Why would
[2902.64 → 2902.94] They do
[2902.94 → 2903.24] That
[2903.24 → 2904.10] Why would
[2904.10 → 2904.42] You bring
[2904.42 → 2904.96] Your blind
[2904.96 → 2905.36] Lame
[2905.36 → 2905.78] And diseased
[2905.78 → 2906.18] Animals
[2906.18 → 2907.36] Well because
[2907.36 → 2907.84] They were
[2907.84 → 2908.18] Animals
[2908.18 → 2908.46] That you
[2908.46 → 2908.70] Couldn't
[2908.70 → 2908.94] Eat
[2908.94 → 2910.18] That you
[2910.18 → 2910.48] Couldn't
[2910.48 → 2910.80] Sell
[2910.80 → 2912.22] And that
[2912.22 → 2912.72] You wouldn't
[2912.72 → 2913.30] Even give
[2913.30 → 2913.70] Away to
[2913.70 → 2914.02] Somebody
[2914.02 → 2915.04] They were
[2915.04 → 2915.74] Not worth
[2915.74 → 2916.42] Anything
[2916.42 → 2917.52] To you
[2917.52 → 2918.44] So they
[2918.44 → 2918.92] Were essentially
[2918.92 → 2919.64] Saying well
[2919.64 → 2920.28] There's nothing
[2920.28 → 2920.84] Else I can
[2920.84 → 2921.26] Do with
[2921.26 → 2921.80] This blind
[2921.80 → 2922.14] Lame
[2922.14 → 2922.52] And diseased
[2922.52 → 2922.92] Animal
[2922.92 → 2923.60] I guess
[2923.60 → 2923.86] I'll just
[2923.86 → 2924.18] Bring it
[2924.18 → 2924.64] To church
[2924.64 → 2924.96] And give
[2924.96 → 2925.18] It to
[2925.18 → 2925.48] God
[2925.48 → 2927.14] And by
[2927.14 → 2927.74] Doing this
[2927.74 → 2928.02] They are
[2928.02 → 2928.50] Showing
[2928.50 → 2929.10] That they
[2929.10 → 2929.72] Would rather
[2929.72 → 2930.58] Be slightly
[2930.58 → 2931.20] Richer
[2931.20 → 2931.94] Themselves
[2931.94 → 2932.52] Than to
[2932.52 → 2932.80] Honour
[2932.80 → 2933.22] God
[2933.22 → 2934.46] In other
[2934.46 → 2934.84] Words
[2934.84 → 2935.84] They had
[2935.84 → 2936.42] A high
[2936.42 → 2936.84] View of
[2936.84 → 2937.42] Themselves
[2937.42 → 2938.14] And a
[2938.14 → 2938.86] Very low
[2938.86 → 2939.32] View
[2939.32 → 2940.10] Of whom
[2940.10 → 2940.36] God
[2940.36 → 2940.70] Is
[2940.70 → 2942.58] And so
[2942.58 → 2943.20] The Lord
[2943.20 → 2943.98] Challenges
[2943.98 → 2944.28] Them
[2944.28 → 2945.58] And he
[2945.58 → 2946.00] Says this
[2946.00 → 2946.30] In verse
[2946.30 → 2946.58] Eight
[2946.58 → 2947.46] If you look
[2947.46 → 2947.74] At verse
[2947.74 → 2947.92] Eight
[2947.92 → 2948.38] God says
[2948.38 → 2948.66] This
[2948.66 → 2949.74] Try offering
[2949.74 → 2950.26] Them to
[2950.26 → 2950.86] Your governor
[2950.86 → 2952.14] Would he
[2952.14 → 2952.72] Be pleased
[2952.72 → 2953.12] With you
[2953.12 → 2954.68] Would he
[2954.68 → 2955.64] Accept you
[2955.64 → 2956.80] Says the
[2956.80 → 2957.62] Lord Almighty
[2957.62 → 2959.04] And so at
[2959.04 → 2959.56] The time that
[2959.56 → 2960.04] Malachi was
[2960.04 → 2960.64] Profiling to
[2960.64 → 2960.98] The people
[2960.98 → 2961.42] Of God
[2961.42 → 2962.32] God's people
[2962.32 → 2962.94] As I
[2962.94 → 2963.26] Mentioned
[2963.26 → 2963.64] We're living
[2963.64 → 2964.20] Under Persian
[2964.20 → 2964.56] Rule
[2964.56 → 2965.38] So the
[2965.38 → 2965.40] So the
[2965.40 → 2965.68] Governor
[2965.68 → 2965.70] So the governor
[2965.70 → 2966.08] Here in
[2966.08 → 2966.28] Verse
[2966.28 → 2966.56] Eight
[2966.56 → 2966.90] Is a
[2966.90 → 2967.20] Persian
[2967.20 → 2967.66] Governor
[2967.66 → 2968.22] Who is
[2968.22 → 2968.68] The local
[2968.68 → 2969.40] Administrator
[2969.40 → 2969.78] Of the
[2969.78 → 2970.12] Land of
[2970.12 → 2970.38] Judah
[2970.38 → 2971.46] And God
[2971.46 → 2971.86] Is saying
[2971.86 → 2972.42] You would
[2972.42 → 2973.54] Never bring
[2973.54 → 2975.54] This governor
[2975.54 → 2976.46] A blind
[2976.46 → 2976.94] Or lame
[2976.94 → 2977.30] Animal
[2977.30 → 2977.68] You would
[2977.68 → 2978.00] Never
[2978.00 → 2979.10] Have the
[2979.10 → 2979.84] Nerve
[2979.84 → 2980.54] To do
[2980.54 → 2980.90] Such a
[2980.90 → 2981.12] Thing
[2981.12 → 2983.08] And he
[2983.08 → 2983.50] Says
[2983.50 → 2984.12] If you
[2984.12 → 2984.36] Wouldn't
[2984.36 → 2984.78] Bring this
[2984.78 → 2985.10] To an
[2985.10 → 2985.50] Earthly
[2985.50 → 2985.82] Ruler
[2985.82 → 2986.80] How much
[2986.80 → 2987.54] More so
[2987.54 → 2988.36] Would you
[2988.36 → 2988.90] Dare
[2988.90 → 2990.02] To bring
[2990.02 → 2991.78] This scrap
[2991.78 → 2992.36] Offering
[2992.36 → 2993.32] To a
[2993.32 → 2993.50] Mighty
[2993.50 → 2993.88] God
[2993.88 → 2995.68] So God
[2995.68 → 2996.36] Confronts his
[2996.36 → 2996.90] People about
[2996.90 → 2997.20] This
[2997.20 → 2997.72] He says
[2997.72 → 2998.34] This is
[2998.34 → 2998.82] How you
[2998.82 → 2999.52] Despise
[2999.52 → 2999.76] Me
[2999.76 → 3000.42] You show
[3000.42 → 3001.02] Contempt
[3001.02 → 3001.52] For me
[3001.52 → 3002.52] Your offerings
[3002.52 → 3003.42] Are offensive
[3003.42 → 3004.88] You don't
[3004.88 → 3005.58] Honour
[3005.58 → 3006.06] Me
[3006.06 → 3008.64] Now look at
[3008.64 → 3009.06] How the people
[3009.06 → 3009.60] Respond
[3009.60 → 3010.96] I find this
[3010.96 → 3011.90] Very funny
[3011.90 → 3013.42] We see this
[3013.42 → 3013.68] In verse
[3013.68 → 3014.28] 13
[3014.28 → 3014.84] And you
[3014.84 → 3015.22] Say
[3015.22 → 3016.26] What a
[3016.26 → 3016.98] Burden
[3016.98 → 3018.00] And you
[3018.00 → 3018.54] Sniff
[3018.54 → 3019.72] Contemptuously
[3019.72 → 3020.70] Says the
[3020.70 → 3021.20] Lord Almighty
[3021.20 → 3022.26] I don't know
[3022.26 → 3022.70] Do you
[3022.70 → 3023.24] Remember when
[3023.24 → 3023.56] You were a
[3023.56 → 3023.96] Kid or
[3023.96 → 3024.18] When you
[3024.18 → 3024.38] Were a
[3024.38 → 3024.76] Teenager
[3024.76 → 3025.60] Or maybe
[3025.60 → 3026.34] You kids
[3026.34 → 3026.78] And teenagers
[3026.78 → 3027.20] Here you
[3027.20 → 3027.52] Don't have
[3027.52 → 3027.92] To remember
[3027.92 → 3028.22] Because you
[3028.22 → 3028.58] Are one
[3028.58 → 3030.70] Your parents
[3030.70 → 3031.26] Ask you to
[3031.26 → 3031.54] Do a
[3031.54 → 3032.14] Chore around
[3032.14 → 3032.62] The house
[3032.62 → 3034.58] Like take
[3034.58 → 3034.86] Out the
[3034.86 → 3035.28] Trash or
[3035.28 → 3035.58] Something
[3035.58 → 3036.62] What is
[3036.62 → 3037.28] The response
[3037.28 → 3039.82] You roll
[3039.82 → 3040.84] Your eyes
[3040.84 → 3042.88] You let
[3042.88 → 3043.14] Out this
[3043.14 → 3044.30] Long sigh
[3044.30 → 3044.94] Ah
[3044.94 → 3046.50] Right
[3046.50 → 3047.08] Suddenly
[3047.08 → 3047.70] Your arms
[3047.70 → 3048.18] And legs
[3048.18 → 3048.50] Feel like
[3048.50 → 3048.78] They weigh
[3048.78 → 3049.34] A thousand
[3049.34 → 3050.04] Pounds
[3050.04 → 3050.84] You think
[3050.84 → 3051.98] Such a
[3051.98 → 3052.48] Burden
[3052.48 → 3055.22] You don't
[3055.22 → 3055.50] Know anything
[3055.50 → 3055.88] About that
[3055.88 → 3056.14] Right
[3056.14 → 3059.16] God says
[3059.16 → 3059.64] That is
[3059.64 → 3060.08] Essentially
[3060.08 → 3060.68] What Israel
[3060.68 → 3061.18] Is doing
[3061.18 → 3062.32] When I
[3062.32 → 3062.76] Ask you
[3062.76 → 3063.10] To worship
[3063.10 → 3063.34] Me
[3063.34 → 3063.74] The way
[3063.74 → 3064.20] You act
[3064.20 → 3064.64] Is like
[3064.64 → 3065.60] Ah
[3065.60 → 3067.52] It's such
[3067.52 → 3067.96] A burden
[3067.96 → 3068.82] It is such
[3068.82 → 3069.34] Drudgery
[3069.34 → 3070.66] They roll
[3070.66 → 3071.28] Their spiritual
[3071.28 → 3071.68] Eyes
[3071.68 → 3072.02] When they
[3072.02 → 3072.46] Are asked
[3072.46 → 3072.82] To bring
[3072.82 → 3073.54] A proper
[3073.54 → 3074.80] Sacrifice
[3074.80 → 3076.56] And they
[3076.56 → 3076.88] Thought to
[3076.88 → 3077.28] Themselves
[3077.28 → 3077.84] Does it
[3077.84 → 3078.30] Really
[3078.30 → 3079.02] Matter
[3079.02 → 3080.68] Right
[3080.68 → 3081.12] What is
[3081.12 → 3081.40] The big
[3081.40 → 3081.58] Deal
[3081.58 → 3081.96] God
[3081.96 → 3083.28] And the
[3083.28 → 3083.52] Answer
[3083.52 → 3083.98] According to
[3083.98 → 3084.20] God
[3084.20 → 3084.86] Is that
[3084.86 → 3085.80] It does
[3085.80 → 3086.14] Matter
[3086.14 → 3087.50] It is
[3087.50 → 3088.00] A big
[3088.00 → 3088.28] Deal
[3088.28 → 3089.84] And look
[3089.84 → 3090.16] At verse
[3090.16 → 3090.46] 10
[3090.46 → 3090.84] God is
[3090.84 → 3091.22] Speaking
[3091.22 → 3091.94] And this
[3091.94 → 3092.16] Is what
[3092.16 → 3092.42] He says
[3092.42 → 3092.68] In verse
[3092.68 → 3092.98] 10
[3092.98 → 3093.88] Oh that
[3093.88 → 3094.26] You would
[3094.26 → 3094.68] Shut
[3094.68 → 3095.42] The temple
[3095.42 → 3096.04] Doors
[3096.04 → 3096.64] So that
[3096.64 → 3096.86] You would
[3096.86 → 3097.28] Not let
[3097.28 → 3097.74] Useless
[3097.74 → 3098.06] Fires
[3098.06 → 3098.36] On my
[3098.36 → 3098.76] Altar
[3098.76 → 3100.28] I am
[3100.28 → 3100.80] Not pleased
[3100.80 → 3101.22] With you
[3101.22 → 3102.24] Says the
[3102.24 → 3102.44] Lord
[3102.44 → 3102.82] Almighty
[3102.82 → 3103.18] And I
[3103.18 → 3103.38] Will
[3103.38 → 3103.76] Accept
[3103.76 → 3104.40] No
[3104.40 → 3104.94] Offering
[3104.94 → 3105.84] From your
[3105.84 → 3106.30] Hands
[3106.30 → 3108.20] Right
[3108.20 → 3108.58] This is
[3108.58 → 3108.96] Stark
[3108.96 → 3109.46] God is
[3109.46 → 3109.80] Saying
[3109.80 → 3111.58] Close
[3111.58 → 3112.34] The temple
[3112.34 → 3113.28] It would
[3113.28 → 3113.68] Be better
[3113.68 → 3114.06] To close
[3114.06 → 3114.50] The temple
[3114.50 → 3115.28] Than
[3115.28 → 3116.24] To accept
[3116.24 → 3116.48] This
[3116.48 → 3117.32] Worthless
[3117.32 → 3118.32] Insulting
[3118.32 → 3118.66] Worship
[3118.66 → 3119.42] That you
[3119.42 → 3119.80] Are currently
[3119.80 → 3120.16] Offering
[3120.16 → 3120.34] Me
[3120.34 → 3120.88] He's
[3120.88 → 3120.98] Just
[3120.98 → 3121.14] Like
[3121.14 → 3121.70] Lock
[3121.70 → 3121.88] The
[3121.88 → 3122.22] Doors
[3122.22 → 3123.20] Don't
[3123.20 → 3123.38] Light
[3123.38 → 3123.56] The
[3123.56 → 3123.88] Fire
[3123.88 → 3125.12] Keep
[3125.12 → 3125.40] Your
[3125.40 → 3125.90] Blemished
[3125.90 → 3126.38] Animals
[3126.38 → 3126.66] I
[3126.66 → 3126.98] Don't
[3126.98 → 3127.18] Want
[3127.18 → 3127.38] Them
[3127.38 → 3129.22] Essentially
[3129.22 → 3129.58] He's
[3129.58 → 3129.88] Saying
[3129.88 → 3130.14] To
[3130.14 → 3130.32] The
[3130.32 → 3130.64] People
[3130.64 → 3131.18] If
[3131.18 → 3131.56] You're
[3131.56 → 3131.78] Going
[3131.78 → 3132.00] To
[3132.00 → 3132.36] Give
[3132.36 → 3133.44] Me
[3133.44 → 3134.04] Your

[3455.20 → 3455.54] DEI
[3455.54 → 3456.38] I
[3456.38 → 3456.52] Think
[3456.52 → 3456.88] Do
[3456.88 → 3458.40] Point
[3458.40 → 3458.82] Is
[3458.82 → 3459.36] Before
[3459.36 → 3459.54] The
[3459.54 → 3459.78] Face
[3459.78 → 3459.90] Of
[3459.90 → 3460.18] God
[3460.18 → 3461.00] I
[3461.00 → 3461.14] Love
[3461.14 → 3461.30] That
[3461.30 → 3461.62] Phrase
[3461.62 → 3461.86] We
[3461.86 → 3462.22] Live
[3462.22 → 3462.60] All
[3462.60 → 3462.76] Of
[3462.76 → 3463.04] Life
[3463.04 → 3463.56] Before
[3463.56 → 3464.06] The
[3464.06 → 3464.54] Face

[3467.46 → 3468.08] All
[3468.08 → 3468.20] Of
[3468.20 → 3468.38] Life
[3468.38 → 3468.52] We
[3468.52 → 3468.88] Offer
[3468.88 → 3469.10] Our
[3469.10 → 3469.34] Whole
[3469.34 → 3469.66] Selves
[3469.66 → 3469.78] To
[3469.78 → 3469.96] Him
[3469.96 → 3499.96] 
[3499.96 → 3529.96] 
[3530.02 → 3530.08] Away
[3530.28 → 3531.62] Mar
[3531.62 → 3531.80] Lives
[3531.80 → 3532.40] teaches
[3532.40 → 3532.76] God
[3532.76 → 3533.74] Horses
[3533.74 → 3534.88] continues
[3534.88 → 3534.96] Our
[3534.96 → 3536.62] Life
[3536.62 → 3538.14] Thank God
[3538.14 → 3539.20] The
[3539.20 → 3539.60] Only
[3539.60 → 3540.20] Problem
[3540.20 → 3540.22] With
[3540.22 → 3540.34] A
[3540.34 → 3540.54] Living
[3540.54 → 3541.18] Sacrifice
[3541.18 → 3543.74] is that it keeps crawling off the altar.
[3547.48 → 3550.90] And for us, when we hear these words of Malachi,
[3551.22 → 3555.74] we know, I am not bringing my best to God.
[3556.58 → 3560.94] And maybe we know I haven't brought my best to God in a long time.
[3563.44 → 3566.42] I think that is true for all of us in one way or another,
[3566.50 → 3568.76] in one part of our lives, whether it's in our Sunday worship,
[3568.76 → 3573.88] in our singing, in our willingness to confess,
[3574.00 → 3575.50] in our willingness to listen to God's word.
[3575.74 → 3578.06] Or it could just be in our use of our money,
[3578.54 → 3579.86] or in our thought life,
[3580.40 → 3583.98] or in what we give into our relationships in all these ways.
[3584.78 → 3586.50] We're not bringing our best to God.
[3587.44 → 3588.88] But friends, here's the good news.
[3589.76 → 3592.32] God doesn't need the perfect sacrifice from you
[3592.32 → 3597.94] because he's already received the perfect sacrifice from Jesus on your behalf.
[3598.76 → 3601.26] See, the sacrificial system for Israel,
[3601.38 → 3605.34] it was supposed to be a glimpse into what God was going to do one day.
[3606.14 → 3611.32] God always had something bigger and better and far more beautiful in his mind.
[3611.50 → 3614.96] It was never about goats and bulls and birds.
[3616.06 → 3619.24] It was never about anything what his people could offer him.
[3619.24 → 3624.82] It was always to point to the true Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
[3626.14 → 3629.54] So, a final verse I want to share with you this morning is Hebrews 10.
[3630.58 → 3632.20] 11 to 12, this is what it says.
[3632.62 → 3636.62] Day after day, every priest stands and performs his religious duties.
[3637.02 → 3639.56] Again and again, he offers the same sacrifices,
[3640.08 → 3642.32] which can never take away sins.
[3642.32 → 3646.30] Never take away sins.
[3647.58 → 3650.86] But, when this priest, Jesus Christ,
[3651.16 → 3654.04] had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins,
[3654.64 → 3656.30] he sat down at the right hand of God.
[3656.46 → 3656.98] That was it.
[3658.28 → 3658.50] Right?
[3658.60 → 3663.06] The sacrificial system was never meant to actually take away the sins of God's people.
[3663.06 → 3666.26] It was always meant to point forward to Jesus,
[3666.44 → 3670.64] who only Jesus could take away the sins of his people.
[3673.40 → 3677.36] His death on the cross abolishes the sacrificial system
[3677.36 → 3679.82] because he has offered the perfect sacrifice.
[3680.28 → 3682.70] And that means we are reconciled to God,
[3682.76 → 3684.92] not by anything that we can bring before God.
[3685.46 → 3688.88] Our relationship with God as a loving father
[3688.88 → 3690.46] is not because we are good children.
[3690.46 → 3693.28] It's not because we have to clean ourselves up.
[3693.82 → 3696.66] We don't have to earn his approval in any way.
[3696.84 → 3699.80] It is simply because of what Christ has done for us.
[3700.30 → 3701.92] And when we accept that,
[3702.62 → 3705.48] we see the extent of God's love for us.
[3706.42 → 3707.92] And when we accept that,
[3708.00 → 3709.54] that is what enables us,
[3709.84 → 3710.70] empowers us,
[3710.98 → 3713.08] gives us the joy to then say to God,
[3714.14 → 3716.66] Lord, use my life in such a way
[3716.66 → 3718.56] that your glory would be on display.
[3718.56 → 3722.20] Lord, use my life for your glory in this world,
[3722.54 → 3723.76] for the sake of your kingdom,
[3724.00 → 3726.30] as imperfect as I am.
[3728.02 → 3729.74] So friends, in this Lenten season,
[3729.90 → 3734.48] may you know the depths of God's love for you in Christ.
[3735.22 → 3736.02] Let's pray together.
[3739.72 → 3742.42] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this word of Malachi.
[3742.72 → 3746.34] Lord, when you confront us as your people,
[3746.34 → 3749.86] Lord, we are poor sacrifices.
[3750.34 → 3751.04] We confess.
[3752.80 → 3756.78] But Lord, we thank you that because Christ is the perfect sacrifice,
[3757.48 → 3761.02] we can have a relationship with God, our Father,
[3761.08 → 3762.38] that we were created to have.
[3762.82 → 3765.52] And that we can live for you as we were created to live,
[3766.00 → 3767.34] as living sacrifices.
[3768.28 → 3769.66] So Lord, would you help us?
[3769.72 → 3771.10] Would you examine our hearts
[3771.10 → 3774.04] to find what are those places in our lives
[3774.04 → 3776.54] where we need to lay ourselves down
[3776.54 → 3778.40] to give the best of who we are,
[3778.52 → 3779.88] of what we have to you?
[3780.52 → 3781.84] And in doing so, Lord,
[3781.88 → 3783.80] would you help us find great joy?
[3784.60 → 3785.94] Lord, help us by your Holy Spirit.
[3786.54 → 3787.86] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3788.12 → 3788.34] Amen.
[3790.30 → 3791.64] So we are going to sing
[3791.64 → 3793.22] a song of response,
[3793.36 → 3794.88] Crown Him with Many Crowns.
[3794.88 → 3795.48] Please stand,
[3795.78 → 3796.66] and let's sing this together.
[3796.66 → 3825.82] Crown Him with Many Crowns,
[3825.82 → 3829.50] The Lamb of all years grown.
[3829.50 → 3834.46] Our calendar held me at the end,
[3834.46 → 3839.20] But a music on its own.
[3839.80 → 3843.86] Awake, my soul, and sing
[3843.86 → 3848.80] Of Him who died for Thee,
[3849.06 → 3853.52] And live as Thy matchless King
[3853.52 → 3857.20] Through all eternity.
[3857.20 → 3857.36] Through all eternity.
[3859.36 → 3863.32] Come and lift the Lord of life
[3863.32 → 3867.66] Who triumphed for the grave
[3867.66 → 3872.74] And rose victorious in the strength
[3872.74 → 3876.96] For those He came to save
[3876.96 → 3880.96] His glories now we sing
[3880.96 → 3885.96] Who died and rose on fire
[3885.96 → 3891.26] Who died eternal life to bring
[3891.26 → 3895.96] And lives that death may die
[3895.96 → 3901.06] From Him the Lord of life
[3901.06 → 3904.96] Behold His hands and sky
[3904.96 → 3910.30] Rich who's yet visible upon
[3910.30 → 3914.68] In beauty glorified
[3914.68 → 3919.30] Though angel in the sky
[3919.30 → 3924.08] Can fully bear the sight
[3924.08 → 3928.98] The groundwork and seized burning light
[3928.98 → 3932.96] That mystery so bright
[3932.96 → 3938.96] Round Him the Lord of peace
[3938.96 → 3943.64] Whose power a sceptre swains
[3943.64 → 3948.72] From coal to coal that wars may cease
[3948.72 → 3953.10] And all be prayer and praise
[3953.10 → 3957.44] His wings shall know no end
[3957.44 → 3962.60] And round His pierced feet
[3962.60 → 3966.10] Their flowers of paradise
[3966.10 → 3972.32] Their fragrance never stream
[3972.32 → 3974.32] Crown Him the Lord of peace
[3974.32 → 3978.32] Crown Him the Lord of peace
[3978.32 → 3982.32] The potent aid of time
[3982.32 → 3988.32] Creator of the Holy Spirit
[3988.32 → 3992.32] In the heavenly supply
[3992.32 → 3994.32] You may be seated
[3994.32 → 3995.32] You may be seated
[3995.32 → 3997.32] You may be seated
[3997.32 → 3999.32] You may be seated
[3999.32 → 4003.32] You may be seated
[4003.32 → 4005.32] Our offering this morning is for a world renew
[4005.32 → 4007.32] And it's for the Food Grains Bank
[4007.32 → 4009.32] Food Grains and World Renew
[4009.32 → 4010.32] Food Grains and World Renew
[4010.32 → 4011.32] Have a partnership
[4011.32 → 4013.32] And I received an email this week from World Renew
[4013.32 → 4015.32] And I'd just like to read you the
[4015.32 → 4017.32] The food Grains Bank
[4017.32 → 4018.32] The food Grains Bank
[4018.32 → 4019.32] The food Grains Bank
[4019.32 → 4020.32] The food Grains and World Renew
[4020.32 → 4021.32] You may be seated
[4021.32 → 4022.32] You may be seated
[4022.32 → 4023.32] You may be seated
[4023.32 → 4024.32] You may be seated
[4024.32 → 4026.32] Our offering this morning is for World Renew
[4026.32 → 4030.32] And it's for the Food Grains Bank
[4030.32 → 4031.32] Food Grains and World Renew
[4031.32 → 4032.32] And it's for the Food Grains Bank
[4032.32 → 4033.32] Food Grains and World Renew
[4033.32 → 4034.32] Have a partnership
[4034.32 → 4035.32] And I received an email this week from World Renew
[4035.32 → 4038.32] And I'd just like to read you a little bit about that
[4038.32 → 4039.32] Before the deacons come up for a sec
[4039.32 → 4048.32] And then I'm going to read you a story that they sent me
[4048.32 → 4050.32] So just to give you a bit of background
[4050.32 → 4052.32] The United Nations reports
[4052.32 → 4056.32] That there are an estimated 100 million people
[4056.32 → 4060.32] Who have been forcibly displaced worldwide
[4060.32 → 4067.32] As a result of conflict, persecution, human rights violations and violence
[4067.32 → 4074.32] Humanity is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record
[4074.32 → 4077.32] Among the displaced are the most vulnerable
[4077.32 → 4083.32] Including women, children, the disabled, those struggling with poor health
[4083.32 → 4088.32] World Renew, along with Canadian Food Grains Bank and local partners
[4088.32 → 4093.32] Is working to deliver emergency food to the most vulnerable families
[4093.32 → 4096.32] Like Abyss's, who I'll tell you about in a minute
[4096.32 → 4103.32] Today is Canadian Food Bank Sunday
[4103.32 → 4108.32] And again, your church's offering will be matched up to four times
[4108.32 → 4112.32] Multiplying the impact of your gifts and sharing God's love
[4112.32 → 4115.32] With more people who struggle with hunger
[4115.32 → 4118.32] So thank you for giving generously
[4118.32 → 4121.32] And as the deacons this morning take up the offering
[4121.32 → 4125.32] I will read you this story about Abyss that I've been sent
[4125.32 → 4131.32] Abyss and her family are from Afric, Syria
[4131.32 → 4137.32] She shares, the war broke out, and we had to leave our home
[4137.32 → 4139.32] Everything got destroyed
[4139.32 → 4143.32] They sought refuge in Lebanon, but Abyss says life has not been easy
[4143.32 → 4145.32] My husband is deaf and mute
[4145.32 → 4150.32] He was like that before, but it got worse due to the fear and trauma of the war
[4150.32 → 4152.32] So it made it very difficult for him to find work
[4152.32 → 4156.32] And our financial situation has long been terrible
[4156.32 → 4158.32] Eventually he found a job in a bakery
[4158.32 → 4163.32] But his employer was very abusive, and he felt very humiliated
[4163.32 → 4170.32] Today Abyss feels more hopeful for the future
[4170.32 → 4178.32] Through our local church partner, her family has received food vouchers, milk and diapers, hygiene kits
[4178.32 → 4183.32] And the church supported her husband in finding a job with an employer who treats him with respect
[4183.32 → 4190.32] Abyss says, thank God for the church and the people there that stood by us
[4190.32 → 4196.32] My husband now happily comes home for work because he is comfortable at his new job
[4196.32 → 4201.32] The people at church tell me not to be afraid because God is with me
[4201.32 → 4203.32] And I believe that
[4203.32 → 4206.32] The Lord will provide
[4206.32 → 4209.32] Nothing is impossible for him
[4209.32 → 4216.32] So, let's remember not only to give but to pray for World Renew
[4216.32 → 4227.32] And all the people who are so desperately in need of just food and materials for their daily existence
[4227.32 → 4229.32] Thank you for your generosity
[4229.32 → 4248.32] Shall we come together in a time of prayer?
[4248.32 → 4251.32] Lord of Lords, King of Kings
[4251.32 → 4255.32] Lord of Lords, King of Kings
[4255.32 → 4260.32] You alone are worthy of all honour, glory and majesty
[4260.32 → 4263.32] We echo the words of the psalmist where he says
[4263.32 → 4266.32] You Lord are most high over all the earth
[4266.32 → 4270.32] You are exalted far above all gods
[4270.32 → 4277.32] We offer our worship in confession, thanksgiving and our requests and supplications to you
[4277.32 → 4281.32] Because you invite us to lay all of these before you
[4281.32 → 4286.32] We confess that this week again we may not have served you with our whole hearts
[4286.32 → 4290.32] We have borne too much of the burden of our anxieties ourselves
[4290.32 → 4293.32] Without coming to you and laying them at your feet
[4293.32 → 4301.32] We thank you that in you there is forgiveness for the things we have done that have grieved you this past week
[4301.32 → 4304.32] And for the things that were left undone
[4304.32 → 4308.32] We thank you for the freedom we have to come and worship you together
[4308.32 → 4313.32] We thank you for the faithful preaching of your word Sunday after Sunday
[4313.32 → 4317.32] And this Sunday again we heard your word
[4317.32 → 4324.32] And we've heard some applications, and possibly we've heard some challenges too
[4324.32 → 4329.32] We pray for the ministries of this church and for the leaders and volunteers
[4329.32 → 4336.32] For the ministries of childcare and Sunday school, GEMS and Cadets, Men's Life, Small Groups
[4338.32 → 4340.32] Such as Coffee Break
[4340.32 → 4345.32] And for English language training for our Chinese brothers and sisters
[4345.32 → 4349.32] We thank you for accessible health healthcare
[4349.32 → 4352.32] And for all healthcare providers
[4352.32 → 4357.32] And we pray for our governments as they seek to attempt to improve also access to healthcare
[4357.32 → 4362.32] As we know Lord that that is not as good as we'd love it to be
[4364.32 → 4368.32] We also thank you for the good spirit at our recent congregational meeting
[4368.32 → 4370.32] We're so richly blessed as a congregation
[4370.32 → 4375.32] As was evident in all the reporting and conversations we had
[4375.32 → 4381.32] Continue to bless us so that we can in turn be a blessing to others as we move forward
[4382.32 → 4386.32] We remember those who are caught in the middle of war and torn areas in the world
[4386.32 → 4389.32] And our brothers and sisters in those areas that live there
[4389.32 → 4392.32] We think especially of the people in Ukraine
[4392.32 → 4398.32] Lord we pray that peace may come to that country too
[4398.32 → 4401.32] Even though we are also in despair
[4402.32 → 4404.32] There are other areas of conflict as well
[4404.32 → 4406.32] And our prayer is that the wars will cease
[4406.32 → 4408.32] And for wisdom to those in authority
[4408.32 → 4410.32] Who regularly broker for peace
[4410.32 → 4414.32] We also pray for the people of Turkey and Syria
[4414.32 → 4417.32] Who so recently suffered those massive earthquakes
[4417.32 → 4419.32] And so many lives lost
[4419.32 → 4421.32] And so much grief
[4421.32 → 4423.32] Lord have mercy
