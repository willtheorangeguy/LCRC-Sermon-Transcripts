[320.00 → 321.00] OK, that's better.
[321.00 → 322.00] It'll get us.
[322.00 → 326.00] So welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church this morning.
[326.00 → 328.00] We are so glad that you are with us.
[328.00 → 333.00] us. Welcome to all those joining us on live stream. And if you are new today, we especially
[333.00 → 338.60] welcome you. We're so glad that you have joined us. There are just a couple of announcements
[338.60 → 345.90] that I want to highlight before we begin our worship service. And actually, please do look
[345.90 → 351.16] through your bulletin, maybe not right now, but later when you go home, there are actually a lot
[351.16 → 356.66] of announcements. So I'm just going to mention a couple. Today, right after the service,
[356.66 → 363.98] it's, well actually today is a very special day. It is Mustafa and Fawn's 50th wedding
[363.98 → 375.68] anniversary. So that is something to celebrate. My wife and I just had our 20th, but that's
[375.68 → 382.94] not even, it's not even half. Very good. So right after the service, we, in the fellowship
[382.94 → 386.82] of Paul, we will be celebrating with them. There'll be a cake to go with our coffee.
[387.16 → 394.02] So please do stay and join us for that celebration. Next Sunday, we will be having a kickoff fall
[394.02 → 399.06] barbecue. So right after the service, we're going to have the grills going, and we're going
[399.06 → 404.92] to have just a lunch together with our whole church and just kind of coming back together
[404.92 → 410.58] after the summer when a lot of people have been away just to celebrate community, to be
[410.58 → 417.18] with each other and to get ready for the new year. Also, please note that the new fall cross
[417.18 → 424.58] training semester is upcoming. There is a congregational meeting on September 27th. Coffee drop-in is
[424.58 → 429.76] starting up. Cade then Gems is starting up. So please do note all of these things.
[429.76 → 440.76] So in a moment, we are going to respond, as we always do at the beginning of our worship service
[440.76 → 450.42] each week, to God's call to come and to worship him. And today, our call to worship comes in part
[450.42 → 459.36] from Psalm 118. And you can put the first bit of that up there. And it starts with these words that
[459.36 → 469.52] are very familiar to us. Psalm 118 says, this is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be
[469.52 → 480.40] glad in it. Now, the context of this Psalm is that God has already come to save his people.
[480.40 → 488.26] from their enemies, from their oppression, from their distress. And because of that, the psalmist says,
[488.66 → 494.60] this is the day that the Lord has made. It's a day of victory. It's a day of liberation.
[496.10 → 500.56] And the same is true for all of us who have put our faith in Jesus Christ.
[501.84 → 506.06] You know, but maybe you come today, and you are feeling discouraged.
[506.06 → 515.22] Maybe you come today feeling defeated by the circumstances of life. Or maybe you come and
[515.22 → 521.12] you are excited to be here. You're joyful. But regardless of our circumstances, it is true
[521.12 → 527.32] today that God has already won the victory for us through the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[527.32 → 529.88] his son. And so for that reason, friends,
[529.88 → 537.62] we can say these words, that this is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[537.62 → 545.04] So let's respond to this call to worship together, beginning again at the beginning. And so please
[545.04 → 553.32] read this responsibly with me. This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[553.32 → 564.72] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants. Praise the name of the Lord. Let the name of the Lord be praised,
[565.10 → 574.44] both now and forevermore. From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[574.44 → 589.10] The Lord is exalted over all the nations and his glory above the heavens. Please pray with me as we respond to God in a prayer of adoration. Let's pray.
[590.18 → 598.18] Father, we come before you and we praise you, and we acknowledge that you are God and there is no other.
[598.18 → 605.02] But beyond that, Lord, you are a God as well who does not just look on our afflictions,
[605.32 → 609.46] our suffering, our brokenness, the state that we are in,
[609.46 → 615.72] in this messed up world, and just leave us to our misery that we have created for ourselves.
[616.92 → 624.36] But you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to come into this world and to win the victory and liberation
[624.36 → 629.50] for all of us who are called by your name, for those who place their trust in you.
[630.60 → 634.62] And so, Father, we come before you and we acknowledge, and we remember that this morning.
[635.16 → 640.34] We praise you that this morning you are God who has seen us, who has come to us.
[641.04 → 646.94] And it's for those reasons that we come before you today and lift our voices to you
[646.94 → 653.98] and direct our hearts to you and our minds to you because of what you have already done for us.
[655.32 → 659.90] Lord, we trust, and we ask that you will continue to meet our needs today.
[660.64 → 662.74] And so, we come to you with expectation.
[663.76 → 670.48] We come to you rejoicing in Christ despite what's happening in our own lives.
[671.10 → 674.24] And we do all that this morning in Jesus' name.
[674.94 → 675.28] Amen.
[675.28 → 680.00] Please stand for God's greeting to us this morning.
[681.16 → 683.96] 2 Corinthians 1, verse 12.
[684.30 → 688.78] Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[689.54 → 693.76] As God has called us, he has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[693.90 → 696.60] He calls us not only to himself, he calls us into a community.
[696.70 → 698.18] So, let's turn and greet one another.
[700.76 → 701.60] Amen.
[701.60 → 702.12] Amen.

[783.68 → 785.68] Amen.

[864.68 → 865.68] Amen.
[865.68 → 866.68] Amen.
[866.68 → 880.92] Like you, all of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[880.92 → 904.92] My comfort, my shelter, thou of refuge and strength, let every breath, oh that I am, there was this who worship you.
[904.92 → 917.76] Shout to the Lord, O the end, let us sing, power and majesty praise to the King.
[918.32 → 929.02] Mountains fall down, and the seas were all at this hour of your name.
[929.02 → 935.02] I seek for joy and the walk of your hands.
[936.18 → 941.02] Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.
[942.32 → 950.02] Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[950.02 → 965.16] Shout to the Lord, O the end, let us sing, power and majesty praise to the King.
[965.92 → 975.02] Mountains fall down, and the seas were all at this hour of your name.
[975.02 → 982.02] I seek for joy and the walk of your hands.
[982.02 → 988.02] Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.
[988.02 → 996.02] Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[996.02 → 1010.96] And Don, if I could just get my monitor down a bit.
[1011.50 → 1016.50] It's just a little loud, so if we can bring my monitor down, thanks.
[1016.50 → 1021.40] All right, rejoice, O pure in heart, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1022.04 → 1026.30] Your festal banner, wave on high, the cross of Christ your King.
[1026.42 → 1028.22] We rejoice together with this song.
[1028.22 → 1030.22] The cross of Christ your King.
[1030.22 → 1047.22] Rejoice, O pure in heart, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1047.22 → 1057.22] Your festal banner, wave on high, the cross of Christ your King.
[1057.22 → 1067.22] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1067.22 → 1077.08] Yes, on two lives long path, till chanting as you go.
[1077.08 → 1087.08] From youth to age, from youth to age, from night and day, in gladness and in love.
[1087.08 → 1097.08] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1097.08 → 1107.08] At last the month shall end, the weary month shall rest.
[1107.08 → 1117.08] The pilgrims find their home at last, Jerusalem and the rest.
[1117.08 → 1127.08] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1127.08 → 1138.08] Praise God, who reigns on high, the Lord who will be atoned.
[1138.08 → 1149.08] The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, come God forevermore.
[1151.08 → 1160.08] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks and sing.
[1160.08 → 1161.08] Amen.
[1161.08 → 1167.08] You may be seated.
[1167.08 → 1168.08] Amen.
[1168.08 → 1169.08] Amen.
[1169.08 → 1170.08] Amen.
[1170.08 → 1171.08] Amen.
[1171.08 → 1172.08] Amen.
[1172.08 → 1173.08] Amen.
[1173.08 → 1174.08] Amen.
[1174.08 → 1179.08] So, of course, as we reflect on the fact that God has come, that God has delivered us,
[1179.08 → 1184.08] part of what we need to remember is that he delivers us not only from our circumstances
[1184.08 → 1192.08] or our enemies or our oppression and affliction, but it's also that he saves us from ourselves,
[1192.08 → 1200.32] right from our own sin and also the way we sin against others here in our English worship later
[1200.32 → 1206.88] on we're going to look at a passage in the book of acts that tells us about disunity that has been
[1206.88 → 1216.40] happening in the church and so with that theme in mind let us confess now our own sin that causes
[1216.40 → 1225.60] disunity in divisions that we sadly so often experience even among believers, so please join
[1225.60 → 1235.20] me as I lead us in prayer please join me in prayer great and loving god we know that one day all
[1235.20 → 1242.80] peoples will worship you on your mountain but lord we struggle to live into that reality
[1242.80 → 1252.64] we are called to live and to serve in community as one body the body of Christ nevertheless we often
[1252.64 → 1260.56] choose division pointing out others wrongs and dividing the body rather than claiming Christ's
[1260.56 → 1267.44] righteousness for all who believe we judge one another, and we do so sometimes even by our own
[1267.44 → 1278.40] judgments so forgive us lord open our eyes to the truth of your perfect plan for your church
[1279.28 → 1289.20] for your church body to graciously be one and most of all lord cleanse us from breaking unity with you
[1289.20 → 1300.08] and we pray this humbly in Christ's name amen so as god's covenant people you know we put our faith in Jesus
[1300.08 → 1306.96] Christ his son and as we do that as we trust in Christ he will deliver us from all of our sin
[1308.64 → 1316.24] and not only that we are being transformed we have been transformed we are being transformed by his spirit
[1316.24 → 1323.52] who has come and given us the gift of faith and of resurrection life and so friends with because of
[1323.52 → 1329.76] that good news hear these words also of god's assurance of his grace and his love and his forgiveness
[1330.72 → 1338.48] and today our assurance of pardon comes from second timothy chapter 1 verse 9 this is what it says god he has
[1338.48 → 1347.04] saved us and called us to a holy life not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose
[1347.04 → 1357.28] and grace given us in Christ Jesus thanks be to god lets all stand and respond to this good news by singing
[1357.28 → 1371.28] together let's sing another song together
[1376.00 → 1385.28] so
[1387.28 → 1393.28] thanks
[1403.28 → 1406.28] we
[1406.28 → 1416.20] Was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.
[1416.20 → 1431.62] Was raised at all my heart to hear, And raised my fear to leave.
[1431.62 → 1443.62] How precious dear that raised the fear, Without my third feet.
[1444.84 → 1457.62] My chains are gone, I've been set free, My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me.
[1457.62 → 1471.46] And like a flood, His mercy brings, My ending love, my amazing grace.
[1471.46 → 1472.46] Amen.
[1472.46 → 1494.46] The Lord has promised words to me, His blood my heart secures.
[1494.46 → 1509.46] He will my shield and worship me, As long as I can't hold.
[1509.46 → 1517.46] The earth shall soon dissolve, That's all my soul,
[1518.06 → 1523.46] The sun for heaven to shine.
[1523.46 → 1537.46] The Father's gold we hear, We know, Will be forever alive.
[1537.46 → 1550.46] My chains are gone, I've been set free, My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me.
[1550.46 → 1571.46] And like a flood, His mercy brings, My chains are gone, I've been set free,
[1571.46 → 1577.46] My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me.
[1577.46 → 1590.46] Let God now fall, His mercy brings, My unending love, my amazing grace.
[1590.46 → 1607.60] Let me be seated.
[1607.60 → 1624.16] Can we come?
[1624.16 → 1625.16] Okay.
[1654.16 → 1658.58] Okay, we'll try that again.
[1659.90 → 1661.94] So we come now to the Lord's table.
[1664.02 → 1672.56] Sometimes, as we come to the Lord's table, especially as we have time to sit and ponder and pray,
[1672.74 → 1679.80] sometimes we ask, well, what should we be thinking about when we do this as we come to the table?
[1679.80 → 1685.66] And, you know, there are lots of things we can say, but let me give you one idea for today.
[1687.00 → 1689.30] What do we think about as we come to this table?
[1689.64 → 1691.62] And here's what I want us to consider.
[1693.04 → 1694.92] What do you want freedom from?
[1697.32 → 1699.80] Okay, what do you want freedom from?
[1700.68 → 1703.22] Or what is it that ensnares you?
[1703.82 → 1708.00] You know, we are all ensnared because of our sin by different things.
[1708.00 → 1711.42] You know, maybe it's wanting the approval of others.
[1712.20 → 1718.12] Maybe we are ensnared by our desire for wealth or possessions.
[1718.88 → 1723.46] It could be our quick temper, our lack of patience.
[1724.86 → 1729.28] It could be, you know, all kinds of different things.
[1729.28 → 1737.28] And so, as we come to the table, and we remember that Jesus died to set us free,
[1737.98 → 1745.32] that he is at work in our lives, and he can set us free from the sins that so easily ensnare us.
[1746.00 → 1753.20] So, as we come to this table, and we consider the death of Christ for our sin,
[1753.20 → 1757.28] what is it that you want to be set free from?
[1757.50 → 1763.20] And apply what Jesus has done for you to that particular area of your life.
[1766.96 → 1773.72] Let's hear the words of institution from the Apostle Paul, which we'll have on the screen.
[1773.72 → 1779.02] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1779.70 → 1782.44] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1782.70 → 1784.46] This is my body, which is for you.
[1785.34 → 1787.60] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1788.60 → 1791.64] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1791.78 → 1795.52] This is the cup of the new covenant in my blood.
[1796.04 → 1800.30] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1800.30 → 1805.24] For as often, friends, as you eat this bread and you drink this cup,
[1805.48 → 1809.54] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1810.84 → 1813.92] And let's say our communion liturgy together.
[1816.60 → 1819.14] Brothers and sisters, lift your hearts.
[1819.88 → 1823.38] We are his people.
[1823.38 → 1826.68] We are redeemed by his grace.
[1826.88 → 1829.30] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1829.96 → 1831.16] Christ has died.
[1831.74 → 1832.96] Christ is risen.
[1833.40 → 1834.96] Christ will come again.
[1835.96 → 1837.18] Christ our Passover.
[1838.06 → 1838.74] Sacrificed.
[1840.20 → 1840.76] Hallelujah.
[1840.76 → 1840.82] Hallelujah.
[1840.82 → 1840.86] Hallelujah.
[1840.86 → 1840.90] Hallelujah.

[1840.94 → 1842.94] Hallelujah.
[1842.94 → 1844.94] Hallelujah.
[1844.94 → 1846.94] Hallelujah.
[1846.94 → 1848.94] Hallelujah.
[1848.94 → 1849.94] Hallelujah.
[1849.94 → 1851.94] Hallelujah.
[1851.94 → 1852.94] Hallelujah.
[1852.94 → 1854.58] God.
[1855.10 → 1862.14] For you, his people, feed on Christ in your hearts by faith with Thanksgiving,
[1863.16 → 1865.42] knowing that Christ has died for you.
[1866.20 → 1869.02] So may I invite our elders to come forward,
[1869.02 → 1872.34] and we will distribute the elements together and eat together.
[1872.34 → 1872.40] Amen.
[1872.40 → 1872.90] Amen.

[1890.98 → 1892.72] Amen.
[1892.76 → 1894.62] Amen.
[1896.76 → 1898.92] Amen.
[1902.82 → 1904.38] Amen.
[1906.20 → 1908.94] Amen.
[1908.94 → 1909.64] Amen.
[1909.70 → 1910.04] Amen.

[2366.92 → 2376.92] Our Heavenly Father, gracious Lord Jesus, we thank you that Christ, you have come to set us free.
[2376.92 → 2381.92] You have come to conquer our enemies of sin and death.
[2381.92 → 2393.92] And not only that, Lord, because of your spirit within us, you have set us free from the sin that we will continue to struggle with on this earthly pilgrimage.
[2393.92 → 2408.92] And, Lord, so we pray that by your grace, that by it, you would help us to apply what your death and your resurrection means for us.
[2408.92 → 2415.92] And that you would set us free, Lord, from the sins that entangle us, that we might glorify you with our lives.
[2415.92 → 2417.92] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[2417.92 → 2418.92] Amen.
[2418.92 → 2419.92] Okay.

[2456.92 → 2457.92] Amen.
[2458.92 → 2462.92] Alright, guys so watch out for that stand, guys, because that won't, like, tip.
[2462.92 → 2465.92] Don't bump that.
[2465.92 → 2469.20] Can you all come over here more?
[2469.20 → 2470.20] Down here?
[2470.20 → 2471.20] Over here?
[2471.20 → 2474.20] Or just not?
[2474.20 → 2475.20] That's fine.
[2475.20 → 2478.20] Hey, hey.
[2478.20 → 2483.84] I can't see you Allie.
[2483.84 → 2484.88] I'll sit here.
[2484.88 → 2486.26] Saturn in 1998, and I can see you better.
[2486.26 → 2497.70] you? Did you have a good summer? Are you ready for school? You made that. It's your birthday.
[2498.46 → 2510.80] Happy birthday. It was your birthday before. Wow. That's exciting. Your brothers? Your grandpa's
[2510.80 → 2523.78] birthday. Right there. Happy birthday. Okay. So it's the start of school. And I remember when I was a kid,
[2523.78 → 2529.50] when I would start school, one thing that was kind of fun about school is getting new school supplies.
[2530.38 → 2537.70] Do you guys get like new pencils, erasers, stuff like that? No? Okay. Well,
[2537.70 → 2545.30] I've got some cool erasers. Actually, these are Gabby's, but I borrowed them. So these are
[2545.30 → 2551.10] erasers. They don't look like it, but this is a unicorn. Cool, right? This one, what's that?
[2552.98 → 2560.96] A heart. You have one? And this is a circle one. And what's that? It's a sun on it. And I have
[2560.96 → 2566.60] a bumblebee. Yeah. So these are, you can collect these, right? And they're cool. They're erasers.
[2566.60 → 2572.68] Now, why did I need so many erasers when I was a student? I don't know, because you ran out of them.
[2573.38 → 2580.58] Well, I needed a lot because, what do you use erasers for? Erasing. Because why would you erase
[2580.58 → 2587.10] something? What does it mean? Because if you do it wrong, you don't do it. Exactly. If you do it wrong.
[2587.10 → 2597.52] So if I need a lot of mistakes, okay? I had to erase a lot because you would write something or do a
[2597.52 → 2601.86] math problem, and you're like, well, that's the wrong answer. So erase, erase, erase, start over.
[2601.86 → 2613.20] So the reason I'm talking about that is because sometimes we do things where we make mistakes
[2613.20 → 2622.18] in life, not just on our homework or our work, but sometimes we do things that we need to say to God,
[2622.74 → 2629.48] I'm sorry, I made a mistake. And when we do that, you know what God does? He erases it.
[2629.48 → 2639.44] Yeah. Because of Jesus. Jesus died on the cross. And because of that, he, in a sense, erases all of
[2639.44 → 2647.52] our sins. So all the mistakes that we make, Jesus erases. Now, I want you to think about that,
[2647.58 → 2653.80] and I want to read a passage for you in Matthew. Matthew 18, verse 21. Listen.
[2653.80 → 2662.36] Peter came to Jesus and asked, Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against
[2662.36 → 2675.16] me? Seven times? No. How many? More or less? Three? Only three. Okay. You know, this is what Jesus says.
[2675.16 → 2686.06] I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times. Right? And actually what he means is we never stop forgiving.
[2686.80 → 2695.76] And that means that because God, Jesus, erases our sins, when people sin against us, maybe they hurt our
[2695.76 → 2704.46] feelings, or they do something we don't like, you know what we can do? One, you know, hopefully we want
[2704.46 → 2710.62] them to say, I'm sorry. And that's good. But in our hearts, we can also do this. We can erase,
[2710.86 → 2716.52] right? We can erase other people's mistakes. And so that's what Jesus wants. Because we've been
[2716.52 → 2723.68] forgiven by Jesus. Our mistakes have been erased. He wants us to use all these erasers, 77 of them,
[2724.16 → 2728.22] to erase the mistakes of other people too. Okay? Can you remember that?
[2728.22 → 2732.22] I'll tell you. Can you take them later and erase their mind?
[2732.62 → 2737.54] No. In your own heart, in your own mind, you erase their mistake and you forgive them.
[2738.26 → 2745.06] Hello. Okay. Let me pray for you. Heavenly Father, we ask that you would help us to erase
[2745.06 → 2752.40] the wrongs, mistakes that other people do to us. Because Lord, you have erased all of our sins and our
[2752.40 → 2760.22] mistakes through Jesus Christ. Lord, help us to forgive others. And we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2760.88 → 2765.16] All right. Thanks for joining me. Now, so you guys can go to your Sunday school classes.
[2765.86 → 2770.30] All right? Okay. Go. Bye-bye.
[2770.30 → 2770.36] Bye-bye.
[2770.36 → 2772.36] Bye-bye.
[2772.36 → 2774.36] Bye-bye.
[2774.36 → 2778.36] Bye-bye.
[2778.36 → 2780.36] Bye-bye.
[2780.36 → 2782.36] Bye-bye.
[2782.40 → 2810.36] Bye-bye.
[2810.36 → 2812.36] Bye-bye.
[2812.40 → 2814.40] Bye-bye.
[2820.40 → 2821.98] Well, it's good to be with you again.
[2823.04 → 2827.92] And so, many of you will know that we are, or have been, in a sermon series in the book of Acts.
[2828.48 → 2832.00] And today, we are in Acts chapter 15 in particular.
[2832.00 → 2835.76] So, please turn with me to Acts chapter 15.
[2835.76 → 2839.28] And we'll be reading verses 36 to 41.
[2839.28 → 2845.12] If you'd like to follow along in your pew Bible, it is on page 824.
[2845.12 → 2846.08] Okay?
[2846.08 → 2848.80] 824 in your pew Bible.
[2848.80 → 2857.28] So, in the passage that we read last week, we saw Paul and Barnabas together.
[2857.28 → 2859.04] Okay?
[2859.04 → 2865.92] Paul and Barnabas defending the truth of the gospel, protecting the unity of the church at the Jerusalem Council.
[2865.92 → 2873.52] But this week, their partnership, their unity comes to a screeching halt.
[2873.52 → 2877.36] And it ends over an issue that may surprise you.
[2877.36 → 2878.96] So, we'll read again.
[2878.96 → 2881.54] Acts 15, verses 36 to the end of the chapter.
[2881.54 → 2886.26] Some time later, Paul said to Barnabas,
[2887.06 → 2893.70] Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preach the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.
[2895.22 → 2899.22] Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.
[2900.42 → 2909.22] But Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
[2909.22 → 2914.42] They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company.
[2915.54 → 2918.34] Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus.
[2919.06 → 2926.10] But Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.
[2927.14 → 2931.38] He went through Syria and Sicilia, strengthening the churches.
[2933.94 → 2935.14] This is the word of the Lord.
[2935.14 → 2936.90] Thank you, Lord.
[2937.86 → 2939.54] Somebody does not want to go to Sunday school.
[2941.70 → 2942.42] But that's okay.
[2943.22 → 2948.18] Let's pray and ask for God's blessing upon his word this morning.
[2948.18 → 2949.06] Let's pray together.
[2951.46 → 2954.06] Oh, Lord, our God, we thank you for your word.
[2954.66 → 2956.98] How precious your word is to us.
[2956.98 → 2966.22] And we ask this morning that you would use the preaching of your word to stir up the spiritual life that is in those who believe.
[2967.22 → 2972.60] And we ask that you would use your word to create spiritual life in those who do not believe.
[2973.02 → 2977.36] So that they, too, may have the light of the glory of God.
[2978.26 → 2981.14] And we ask this in the name of Christ our Lord.
[2981.70 → 2982.06] Amen.
[2982.06 → 2982.14] Amen.
[2984.14 → 2986.54] So I want to begin with a short antidote.
[2987.10 → 2989.82] I don't know if you have ever been deer hunting.
[2990.30 → 2991.02] Show of hands.
[2991.02 → 2992.54] Have you ever been deer hunting?
[2994.38 → 2995.02] Oh, Jane.
[2998.06 → 2998.70] Kind of surprised.
[2999.98 → 3002.14] No, I mean, you know, that's great.
[3002.14 → 3002.62] That's awesome.
[3005.42 → 3006.22] I can see it now.
[3007.18 → 3007.66] Just kidding.
[3008.22 → 3009.98] So I haven't been deer hunting.
[3010.62 → 3013.54] I grew up in a place where some people did hunt deer.
[3013.90 → 3020.66] And actually, one of the things that people would say about the state of Vermont, where I'm from, is that there are more deer than people.
[3021.98 → 3032.50] Well, during the mating season, the bucks, right, with their big antlers, they would fight over territory and over the female deer, of course.
[3032.50 → 3036.64] And as they would, can we have our, there it is.
[3037.18 → 3045.24] So they would kind of smash their antlers into each other, trying to prove to the other who is boss, right?
[3045.32 → 3049.84] And what would happen is that their racks would become entangled.
[3049.84 → 3055.76] Sometimes their racks would become so entangled that they could not be separated.
[3057.30 → 3059.34] It doesn't happen often, but it does happen.
[3059.66 → 3070.16] And when this does happen, when their racks become so entangled that they can't free themselves, they're deadlocked, what happens is they end up dying.
[3070.98 → 3076.08] They're not able to forage for food, and they become easy prey to coyote or other predators.
[3076.08 → 3093.08] And it's a sobering thing to think about, especially since the death of these two amazing animals could have been avoided if either one or the other of them would be willing to physically or emotionally just kind of walk away.
[3094.50 → 3103.00] Well, our passage today contains a sort of fight or a sharp disagreement between two very godly leaders.
[3103.00 → 3108.80] And we have come to know these two individuals quite well at this point in the book of Acts.
[3109.18 → 3111.74] They are Paul and Barnabas.
[3112.56 → 3118.24] And their disagreement is so severe, they end up parting ways.
[3118.24 → 3130.06] And I think it's especially sad that in a chapter, chapter 15, is a chapter that's so focused on unity, right?
[3130.12 → 3135.26] And not just the ideal of unity, but actual unity in the church between Jew and Gentile.
[3136.12 → 3143.46] But even despite all of this talk about unity, you actually end the chapter with disunity among believers.
[3143.46 → 3149.16] And so this morning, very simply, we're going to look at this passage just under two main points.
[3150.10 → 3158.44] Firstly, what is this disagreement all about that leads to Barnabas and Paul going their separate ways?
[3159.38 → 3166.72] And then secondly, what are some lessons that we can learn from this for our own individual lives as Christians with one another,
[3166.86 → 3170.46] and for our life in the community of the church?
[3170.46 → 3173.58] And so let's just dive right in.
[3173.80 → 3176.44] First, Paul and Barnabas breaking up.
[3177.48 → 3180.92] I know, maybe you can cue, what are your top five breakup songs?
[3181.62 → 3185.10] You know, I know, but here, this is a serious breakup.
[3185.24 → 3187.04] Paul and Barnabas going their separate ways.
[3187.32 → 3188.96] Who could have seen that coming?
[3189.82 → 3192.24] And it makes us ask, how did this situation happen?
[3192.24 → 3199.24] So remember, Paul and Barnabas have been working together for many years at this point.
[3199.46 → 3210.30] Ever since Barnabas went in search of Paul to get his help for the growing church and ministry in Antioch.
[3210.82 → 3211.34] Right?
[3211.34 → 3217.78] So remember, the gospel had spread to Antioch, the persecution of Stephen, the believers scattered.
[3218.56 → 3222.14] Some of them went north up to Antioch in Syria.
[3223.04 → 3226.56] And what happened was they were kind of having a revival there in Antioch.
[3226.80 → 3231.52] So much so that the leaders in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to go check it out.
[3231.52 → 3238.96] And when Barnabas arrives in Antioch, he discovers that there are so many people coming to faith
[3238.96 → 3243.26] that he is going to need help ministering to this young church.
[3243.84 → 3244.88] So what does he do?
[3245.54 → 3250.78] Barnabas, he goes, and he finds Paul, who is hanging out up in Tarsus.
[3251.10 → 3257.42] And he brings him back to Antioch to help him, to have Paul help him in the ministry.
[3257.82 → 3260.38] And so they work together in Antioch for about a year.
[3260.38 → 3268.30] And then they went down to Jerusalem to deliver an offering from the Antioch church to the churches in Judea
[3268.30 → 3272.52] that by prophecy were about to suffer a significant famine.
[3273.72 → 3278.02] And then on their return trip from Jerusalem back up to Antioch,
[3278.32 → 3285.40] they brought with them a new young helper to the ministry, a young man named John Mark.
[3286.24 → 3287.12] Acts chapter 12.
[3288.20 → 3289.40] Let me do a quick sidebar.
[3289.40 → 3291.50] Why does he have two names?
[3292.04 → 3293.58] John, sometimes called Mark.
[3294.22 → 3295.14] It's because of this.
[3295.32 → 3299.32] And the Hebrew people during that era, they would often have a Hebrew name.
[3300.00 → 3301.36] So like Saul, right?
[3301.44 → 3301.74] Saul.
[3302.64 → 3306.88] But then once they started going out into the wider Roman world,
[3307.06 → 3310.16] interacting with other peoples, doing commerce or trade,
[3310.24 → 3311.94] they would usually use their Roman name.
[3311.94 → 3314.10] So in Saul's case, it was Paul.
[3314.22 → 3315.10] That was his Roman name.
[3315.64 → 3316.74] And it's the same case here.
[3316.86 → 3318.20] John was his Hebrew name.
[3318.52 → 3321.32] Mark was his kind of gentle Gentile name.
[3321.46 → 3322.38] So John Mark.
[3322.86 → 3324.30] And you'll see them use interchangeably.
[3324.54 → 3327.76] But then over time, it becomes more and more just Mark.
[3327.76 → 3329.92] So anyway, that's what's going on there.
[3330.94 → 3334.90] So now they get this new young helper named John Mark or Mark.
[3335.76 → 3340.90] And it's not surprising that Paul and Barnabas chose Mark to accompany them
[3340.90 → 3346.40] because we know from Colossians and other places that Mark was Barnabas' cousin.
[3346.40 → 3349.32] And so they knew each other, right?
[3349.38 → 3350.60] They were related.
[3351.84 → 3355.10] Mark also, not only was he the cousin of Barnabas,
[3355.16 → 3357.36] he also had a relationship with some of the other apostles.
[3357.92 → 3358.90] Peter, for instance.
[3361.74 → 3366.94] Peter, in 1 Peter 5, verse 13, calls Mark his son.
[3367.62 → 3368.84] His son in the faith.
[3368.98 → 3372.06] He probably discipled the young Mark.
[3372.06 → 3377.50] And Peter had first met Mark at Mark's family home.
[3377.82 → 3380.38] I don't know if you remember this amazing story about Peter.
[3380.78 → 3382.06] Peter is locked up in prison.
[3382.80 → 3387.16] And an angel comes and walks Peter right out of the prison,
[3387.28 → 3388.92] past the guards, out of the gate.
[3389.74 → 3391.98] And Peter thinks, I must be dreaming.
[3392.50 → 3395.18] But then he gets out onto the street, and he realizes,
[3396.12 → 3397.68] wow, I am not dreaming.
[3398.04 → 3398.98] This is real.
[3398.98 → 3401.02] And I am the most wanted man in Jerusalem.
[3401.02 → 3407.08] And so he very quickly finds a house where he knows that the Christians are gathering.
[3407.96 → 3409.20] And whose house is that?
[3410.48 → 3413.96] Mary, who is the mother of Mark.
[3414.46 → 3415.70] It's Mark's family home.
[3416.54 → 3419.22] So that's where Peter meets Mark, and they strike up a relationship.
[3420.00 → 3425.62] So Mark, his cousin is Barnabas, and he was well known and loved by Peter.
[3425.62 → 3431.18] But most importantly, Mark was an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus.
[3432.22 → 3432.34] Right?
[3432.44 → 3436.90] Most scholars believe that Mark was the young man who on the night Jesus was arrested,
[3437.84 → 3438.80] ran away naked.
[3439.84 → 3441.34] Did you know that was in the Bible?
[3442.24 → 3443.78] I had forgotten about this.
[3444.28 → 3447.48] So Mark 14, verse 50 to 52.
[3447.64 → 3448.56] I'll just share this with you.
[3448.56 → 3452.12] Then everyone deserted him and fled.
[3452.24 → 3452.38] Right?
[3452.44 → 3452.84] With Jesus.
[3453.10 → 3454.52] They all ran away.
[3455.06 → 3459.10] A young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus.
[3459.66 → 3463.66] When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
[3464.94 → 3465.34] Okay.
[3465.84 → 3468.82] Now, why do we think this man was Mark?
[3469.38 → 3472.66] Well, because it's a detail that is only included in Mark's gospel.
[3473.40 → 3477.84] And Mark wrote his gospel, the Gospel of Mark, and so it would seem that he added this personal
[3477.84 → 3479.60] detail in his gospel.
[3480.50 → 3480.68] Okay.
[3480.72 → 3481.78] So that's who Mark is.
[3482.14 → 3483.68] He is the cousin of Barnabas.
[3483.86 → 3484.98] He's the friend of Peter.
[3485.10 → 3488.90] And he wrote the second gospel in the New Testament, the Gospel of Mark.
[3489.38 → 3493.88] So what a wonderful asset to have with you on your ministry.
[3494.50 → 3494.72] Right?
[3494.72 → 3498.10] Of course, this is a great guy to go along with you.
[3498.82 → 3503.62] So now when the church in Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey,
[3504.62 → 3506.12] they took Mark with them.
[3506.94 → 3508.20] He was still a young man.
[3508.26 → 3513.60] He was probably just really excited to go along with Paul and Barnabas on this adventure,
[3514.10 → 3516.08] sharing the gospel where it's never been heard.
[3517.34 → 3519.70] Only, he didn't last very long.
[3520.76 → 3525.00] In Acts 13, chapter 13, verse 13, we read this.
[3525.00 → 3530.46] From Paphos, okay, so that's on the island of Cyprus, the first place they went to.
[3530.80 → 3536.80] From Paphos and Cyprus, Paul and his companions then sailed to CERGA in Pamphylia,
[3536.92 → 3546.14] which is north on the mainland in Asia Minor, where John, John Mark, left them to return to Jerusalem.
[3546.14 → 3549.54] Why did Mark leave them?
[3550.44 → 3551.30] We don't know.
[3551.64 → 3552.90] We don't know for sure why.
[3553.54 → 3555.40] But we do know that he did.
[3556.56 → 3562.30] And now in our passage this morning, Acts 15, Paul and Barnabas, they're about to set off on their second trip.
[3562.62 → 3562.74] Right?
[3562.78 → 3565.80] They have preached the gospel all over the area of the world.
[3565.80 → 3570.68] And then Paul, in verse 36, says, let's go back.
[3570.82 → 3572.88] Let's go and see how everyone's doing.
[3573.00 → 3575.12] Let's go around strengthening the churches.
[3577.66 → 3581.36] Barnabas says, great, let's take Mark with us.
[3582.30 → 3585.18] You know, he must have returned, presumably apologetically.
[3586.08 → 3589.86] But Paul is unwilling to take Mark a second time.
[3590.78 → 3594.88] And so we read about this dispute in verses 37 and 38 in our passage.
[3594.88 → 3598.66] Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.
[3599.16 → 3606.22] But Paul did not think it wise to take him because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
[3606.96 → 3611.64] So now we realize that John Mark left not under great circumstances.
[3612.50 → 3615.50] It tells us here that Mark had deserted them.
[3616.10 → 3617.44] He had abandoned them.
[3618.12 → 3622.98] This word deserted, it's a Greek word from which we get our word apostate.
[3622.98 → 3624.18] Right?
[3624.28 → 3627.62] Now Mark was not an apostate in the sense of renouncing his faith.
[3627.92 → 3628.82] Mark was a Christian.
[3629.46 → 3632.34] But he did desert Paul and Barnabas.
[3632.96 → 3634.26] And not happily.
[3635.34 → 3639.54] And so now Paul and Barnabas suddenly have a difference of perspective.
[3640.44 → 3643.48] Should they bring Mark along and give him a second chance?
[3644.30 → 3645.52] Or should they not?
[3645.52 → 3651.04] And verses 37 and 38 show us this is really a matter of opinion.
[3651.50 → 3652.78] So if you put it back up there for me.
[3653.94 → 3655.82] See, notice the words that are used here.
[3656.28 → 3662.64] It says Barnabas wanted to take John, but Paul did not think it wise.
[3663.48 → 3663.68] Right?
[3663.74 → 3666.52] So both of those words, he wanted to, is not wise.
[3666.84 → 3668.66] This is not black and white issues.
[3668.66 → 3668.84] Right?
[3668.84 → 3670.92] They're not arguing about theology.
[3671.70 → 3673.30] You know, they agreed on theology.
[3674.38 → 3679.10] But here, this is a matter of wisdom, of perspective, of opinion.
[3680.68 → 3686.32] And so let's put ourselves, thank you, in the shoes of each of them.
[3686.72 → 3689.96] So let's think first about Benevolent Barnabas.
[3690.58 → 3691.30] That's his nickname.
[3692.24 → 3693.32] Benevolent Barnabas.
[3693.74 → 3694.98] And let's think about his perspective.
[3694.98 → 3698.82] Barnabas is a real encourager.
[3699.04 → 3699.14] Right?
[3699.20 → 3699.72] Remember that?
[3700.32 → 3705.16] His name actually means son of encouragement.
[3706.28 → 3707.48] Barnabas is a people person.
[3707.64 → 3711.98] You know, he would be the guy in the fellowship hall who would be the last person to lead because
[3711.98 → 3714.14] he wants to just talk to everybody.
[3714.52 → 3718.02] He is just going around edifying, building people up.
[3718.62 → 3723.14] And Barnabas has seen massive fruit from his ministry of encouragement.
[3723.14 → 3729.28] And Barnabas is probably thinking, look, Paul, don't you remember when I took a chance on you?
[3730.32 → 3730.66] Right?
[3730.70 → 3736.66] You may remember that Paul was the great persecutor of the church before Jesus met him on the road to Damascus.
[3737.08 → 3739.08] And Paul then, what did Paul do?
[3739.80 → 3742.68] He tried to join the believers in Jerusalem.
[3743.50 → 3746.72] But they were all afraid of Paul.
[3746.72 → 3753.48] They couldn't believe that this man who was previously murdering Christians was now a true disciple of Jesus.
[3753.60 → 3755.64] They thought maybe he's trying to infiltrate us.
[3755.74 → 3756.96] You know, maybe he's going to cause trouble.
[3757.62 → 3762.08] But Barnabas comes along, and he testifies on behalf of Paul.
[3762.16 → 3763.58] He says, don't worry, I know Paul.
[3764.14 → 3765.50] I've seen his ministry.
[3765.72 → 3766.76] We can trust him.
[3766.76 → 3775.64] So in a sense, Paul's own ministry actually exists at some level because of Barnabas.
[3776.74 → 3779.76] So Barnabas is probably thinking, come on, Paul.
[3780.52 → 3782.20] Like, give the guy a break.
[3782.44 → 3783.86] You know, he had a bad moment.
[3783.98 → 3785.18] We all make mistakes.
[3785.62 → 3786.48] He's apologized.
[3787.10 → 3788.98] And he wants to come this time.
[3790.24 → 3792.06] Isn't the gospel about grace?
[3792.78 → 3794.58] We should give him another chance.
[3794.58 → 3798.52] Now, I don't, you don't have to raise your hands necessarily.
[3798.72 → 3799.40] You can if you want.
[3800.28 → 3805.08] But how many of you are like, yeah, you know, I'm with Barnabas on this one.
[3806.56 → 3807.84] Okay, I said you don't have to raise your hand.
[3807.96 → 3808.28] Thanks, Johnny.
[3808.66 → 3810.12] But, okay, maybe half of you.
[3810.16 → 3810.52] I don't know.
[3812.00 → 3815.76] Okay, so now let's put ourselves in the shoes of practical Paul.
[3817.34 → 3822.40] Paul is probably thinking to himself, you know, hey, we are on mission.
[3823.20 → 3824.78] We're about to preach the gospel.
[3825.04 → 3826.64] We're about to go and plant churches.
[3826.76 → 3827.98] We're going to face persecution.
[3828.66 → 3831.30] And last time, this guy abandoned us.
[3831.92 → 3837.10] I had to spend a lot of time, a lot of emotional energy trying to work through that.
[3837.34 → 3841.12] I had to fill out all of these reports to Jerusalem, the leadership.
[3841.88 → 3844.00] It was an embarrassment for our ministry.
[3844.00 → 3848.40] So Paul is probably just thinking, look, I'm not going to risk the mission.
[3849.16 → 3854.96] We have been sent by God with a task to do, and I am going to take the very best team with me.
[3855.70 → 3861.78] And quite frankly, the advance of the gospel is more important than John Mark's feelings.
[3861.78 → 3867.66] Now, again, you don't have to raise your hand, but how many of you side with Paul?
[3869.70 → 3870.56] No, no, it's just kidding.
[3870.84 → 3871.94] So, I don't know.
[3872.10 → 3874.40] Maybe some of you do side with Paul.
[3874.40 → 3878.16] But at the end of the day, they can't see eye to eye.
[3878.92 → 3879.98] They can't agree.
[3880.92 → 3883.40] Now, that's not so much a problem, right?
[3883.50 → 3891.68] Christians can disagree about a lot of things, and we can still share fellowship together.
[3891.80 → 3896.10] We can still, you know, do the work of ministry together.
[3896.10 → 3903.84] But the part that is really troubling to me, and perhaps to you, is what happens in verse 39.
[3904.68 → 3911.62] Verse 39 says, they had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company.
[3913.02 → 3916.36] Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, but Paul chose Silas and left.
[3918.38 → 3922.00] And so what's so sad about this situation is not so much that they had a disagreement,
[3922.00 → 3928.98] but that this disagreement led to Paul and Barnabas separating from each other.
[3929.16 → 3935.90] You know, those words they used, sailed for Cyprus, left, not a problem, except that it was from each other.
[3937.10 → 3941.20] They had been prepared to die for the sake of the gospel together.
[3941.76 → 3944.72] They had preached and prayed together.
[3945.04 → 3946.92] They had eaten and travelled together.
[3947.34 → 3949.40] They had done all of these things together.
[3949.40 → 3953.62] They could even have said, I am sure we are best friends.
[3954.68 → 3955.68] Something like that.
[3956.50 → 3957.44] But they separate.
[3959.42 → 3960.58] So that's the situation.
[3960.92 → 3969.76] So now, by way of application, I want us to consider a few lessons that we can learn from this for our own lives and our lives together as a church.
[3970.80 → 3975.02] And, you know, at first when I considered this passage, I thought, let's just skip it and move on.
[3976.06 → 3978.14] And then, you know, what are we supposed to do with this?
[3978.14 → 3984.18] But kind of the more I thought about it, the more I thought, you know, there are some things that we can take from this.
[3985.00 → 3988.22] So here's the first one, kind of more practically.
[3990.16 → 3991.44] Don't be disappointed.
[3992.28 → 3994.94] Don't be surprised that people are flawed.
[3994.94 → 4002.62] You know, I heard of a pastor share this, that he was in a Bible study once where they were studying the life of Paul.
[4003.12 → 4009.36] And there was someone in the Bible study who wanted to quit the study because they were so disappointed.
[4010.36 → 4010.64] Right?
[4010.70 → 4021.14] They were so disappointed in this man, the Apostle Paul, whom they had idolized and in their mind had fallen from grace, assuming that he was the one at fault in this situation.
[4021.14 → 4032.06] And so, actually, I think it could be helpful for us to see and to recognize how honest the Bible is about the flaws of Christians and of leaders.
[4033.06 → 4033.26] Right?
[4033.30 → 4037.76] The Bible does not lift any man or woman in scriptures as being a hero.
[4038.82 → 4039.08] Right?
[4039.08 → 4046.66] All the Bible's, you know, heroes, so-called, all these massive figures that we read about are massively flawed.
[4047.64 → 4047.86] Right?
[4048.00 → 4052.30] Moses didn't even get to enter the promised land because he got angry and he struck the rock.
[4053.64 → 4055.66] Abraham lied about his wife all the time.
[4056.80 → 4063.66] Peter, Jesus' best friend, denied that he even knew Jesus when Jesus needed him.
[4064.76 → 4064.96] Right?
[4064.96 → 4069.18] Friends, the Bible is full of very, very flawed figures.
[4070.28 → 4071.78] Barnabas is a flawed sinner.
[4072.38 → 4074.40] Paul is a flawed sinner.
[4075.50 → 4077.56] Me and you are flawed sinners.
[4079.90 → 4084.98] And part of the reason that the Bible includes all of these people is, one, it's true.
[4085.62 → 4085.86] Okay?
[4085.92 → 4087.06] So we're not making this stuff up.
[4087.14 → 4091.44] If we did, we would make it maybe doesn't look so averaging against the church.
[4091.44 → 4093.66] But, in fact, it's true, so it's there.
[4094.18 → 4099.16] And to make it clear that the hero of the Christian story is Jesus.
[4100.00 → 4100.24] Right?
[4100.28 → 4102.56] We are Christians because Jesus is the Saviour.
[4103.16 → 4104.18] Jesus is the hero.
[4105.08 → 4114.66] And so remembering that not only helps us to fix our eyes on Jesus, but also it helps us have more understanding when fellow Christians disappoint us.
[4115.06 → 4117.66] Or even fellow Christians who we read about in scripture.
[4118.74 → 4119.48] Okay, so that's the first thing.
[4119.48 → 4121.00] Don't be disappointed that people are flawed.
[4121.44 → 4123.66] The next point is related to that.
[4124.16 → 4136.18] Because when we realize that people in the Bible are flawed, and in this case where there's this division and disunity, that doesn't mean that we should say, well, I guess we should just give up.
[4136.74 → 4138.70] So, can you put the next part up there?
[4140.30 → 4143.42] We shouldn't just give up on this idea of unity.
[4143.42 → 4153.26] We might be tempted to think, well, look, hey, if the apostles are in such sharp disagreement, what chance do we kind of regular Christians have?
[4154.10 → 4157.08] But that's not the right conclusion we should draw from this.
[4157.08 → 4159.34] We still strive for unity.
[4159.34 → 4161.20] We still strive for unity.
[4162.56 → 4167.04] Paul was famous for encouraging unity and reconciliation in the church.
[4167.64 → 4174.00] So he wrote to the church of the Corinthians, who are having so much division in the church.
[4174.00 → 4176.18] This is what Paul writes.
[4176.18 → 4177.62] Chapter 1, verse 10.
[4178.28 → 4194.56] I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
[4194.56 → 4224.54] Okay, Paul.
[4224.56 → 4231.16] And we're still in need of the sanctifying work of Christ in ourselves as individuals and in our relationships with others.
[4231.62 → 4235.74] No one is impervious to conflict in the church.
[4236.84 → 4246.70] But we should still pursue unity as much as we can because that is what God calls us to, even as we do it imperfectly.
[4246.70 → 4256.88] Okay, so we still need to, even though we read, you know, these descriptions of disunity, we have teachings and calls, commands to unity.
[4257.54 → 4259.52] And so we should pursue that.
[4260.18 → 4264.44] Third, love the church enough to argue.
[4264.44 → 4274.82] And while I am saddened by what I read here from Luke, the author, I am actually quite encouraged in another respect.
[4274.82 → 4285.08] And I am encouraged for this reason, that Paul and Barnabas obviously loved the church so much that they were willing to argue over this.
[4286.18 → 4286.32] Right?
[4286.38 → 4289.46] In other words, they saw something important at stake.
[4290.12 → 4292.14] They saw that the gospel was at stake.
[4292.22 → 4294.06] The mission was at stake.
[4294.06 → 4296.94] And they were prepared to debate over it.
[4297.96 → 4298.22] Right?
[4298.36 → 4305.28] Barnabas thinks it's better for the sake of the gospel that John Mark come with them.
[4306.04 → 4310.48] Paul thinks it is better for the sake of the gospel that he doesn't.
[4311.08 → 4313.90] But they are willing to disagree with each other.
[4314.02 → 4318.10] And they're willing to have a sharp disagreement because they love the church.
[4318.34 → 4319.56] Because they love Jesus.
[4319.98 → 4321.00] They love the truth.
[4321.00 → 4326.60] So much so that they are prepared to put the cause of the gospel even above their own friendship.
[4328.44 → 4333.04] You know, what do you think it was like for Paul when he left?
[4335.44 → 4339.06] What do you think it was like for Barnabas when he left?
[4340.56 → 4340.96] Right?
[4341.06 → 4342.36] Do you think they were tears?
[4344.38 → 4344.52] Right?
[4344.52 → 4347.00] Do you think there was sorrow of heart?
[4347.38 → 4349.04] Do you think there was trauma of spirit?
[4350.46 → 4350.68] Right?
[4350.68 → 4351.88] And we don't know who was right.
[4352.92 → 4354.10] We don't know who was wrong.
[4354.16 → 4355.08] Maybe they were both wrong.
[4355.86 → 4360.78] But we know that they loved Jesus Christ so much that they were, and they were so concerned
[4360.78 → 4364.26] for the gospel that they were prepared to have it out.
[4366.00 → 4368.56] And perhaps that's something that we need to learn from this.
[4369.46 → 4372.00] You know, certainly there are people in the church who just love to fight.
[4372.56 → 4376.88] There are people in the church who love to argue about the smallest thing.
[4378.02 → 4379.98] And they need to learn gospel charity.
[4379.98 → 4382.40] They need to learn to hold their opinions more humbly.
[4383.40 → 4386.88] But there are others who really just want peace at all costs.
[4387.82 → 4390.34] And they would not separate over the cause of the truth.
[4390.58 → 4392.78] They might go to a different church if they like the music better.
[4392.78 → 4395.74] But if it's a matter of doctrine, oh, no, no, we shouldn't fight.
[4398.06 → 4399.38] And friends, that's not scriptural.
[4400.66 → 4408.46] What is scriptural is defending the truth, but having gentleness, kindness, love, and patience
[4408.46 → 4411.62] when you argue for the truth.
[4411.62 → 4417.20] So that's something that we also need to take away from this.
[4418.02 → 4423.70] That we need to not seek peace at all costs, but we need to seek the cause of the gospel
[4423.70 → 4426.78] and be willing to argue about some things.
[4426.78 → 4435.34] Now, the fourth and final thing that I see here is that we need to remain open to being reconciled.
[4436.30 → 4441.28] You know, when we have these deep, deep conflicts, sometimes they result in profound separation.
[4441.28 → 4444.90] You may have experienced that yourself.
[4445.78 → 4451.72] And when you experience separation like this, you may feel like it is never going to be healed.
[4453.16 → 4459.92] Paul and Barnabas, when they went their separate ways, they may have felt that they would separate forever.
[4460.04 → 4460.64] They don't know.
[4462.30 → 4467.68] The Bible says very little about Barnabas after this story in Acts 15.
[4467.68 → 4473.68] But we do know that Mark and Paul eventually reconciled.
[4474.42 → 4476.98] Okay, there is a happy ending to this story.
[4477.36 → 4480.66] Because Mark becomes a vital part of Paul's ministry.
[4481.00 → 4485.68] Even staying with Paul and ministering to him during his imprisonment.
[4487.06 → 4491.60] Whatever, you know, bad feelings Mark must have had against Paul,
[4492.16 → 4493.94] when Paul was in trouble, Mark was there.
[4493.94 → 4499.30] Mark became such an important partner to Paul in the work of the gospel,
[4499.68 → 4505.48] that in 2 Timothy 4, verse 11, he asked Timothy to send Mark to him,
[4506.16 → 4509.36] and he says, he is very helpful to me in the ministry.
[4510.42 → 4510.66] Right?
[4510.72 → 4512.58] What a remarkable change that is.
[4513.18 → 4514.38] Who saw that coming?
[4514.38 → 4520.32] Paul was unwilling to take Mark along on this missionary journey,
[4520.48 → 4524.16] to the point of separating with his best partner, Barnabas,
[4524.44 → 4530.72] but now he is requesting Mark by name to come and help him.
[4532.06 → 4535.96] So even though Paul did what he thought was right at the time,
[4536.50 → 4540.92] I think we also see that he allowed the gospel to shape his heart
[4540.92 → 4544.62] to such an extent that he remained open to being reconciled.
[4545.12 → 4547.34] He remained open to maybe being wrong,
[4548.08 → 4550.14] to changing his mind in the future.
[4551.08 → 4554.88] And I think it shows a humility and a softness of heart.
[4555.80 → 4556.20] Right?
[4556.26 → 4559.34] That even though he acted on a sense of his convictions,
[4559.96 → 4561.94] he recognized, you know what?
[4562.06 → 4563.06] God can work.
[4563.50 → 4564.44] God can redeem.
[4565.52 → 4567.50] God can work in my life and in my heart,
[4567.50 → 4570.32] and God can work in the hearts and lives of other people.
[4571.04 → 4573.12] Let's not write off what God can do.
[4573.78 → 4575.82] Let's not write off that other people can change.
[4577.32 → 4580.10] So in other words, friends, even in our disagreements,
[4580.80 → 4584.82] we can still treat one another with love and respect and honour
[4584.82 → 4588.38] because we know that we will spend eternity with them.
[4589.76 → 4594.56] And this means that as much as we want to let the gospel shape our thinking
[4594.56 → 4598.54] and our convictions, we also want the gospel to shape our hearts
[4598.54 → 4601.96] so that we remain tender and open to others.
[4602.26 → 4602.36] Right?
[4602.42 → 4604.82] Not calloused and closed off.
[4608.36 → 4611.08] And let us also be reminded about this.
[4612.34 → 4617.38] That it is likely, sometimes it is just a simple fact,
[4618.02 → 4621.80] that people who are godly will disagree and will separate.
[4621.80 → 4627.28] But friends, what we cannot afford is a broken relationship with God.
[4628.34 → 4628.78] Right?
[4628.94 → 4632.14] Jesus has been on the wrong side of a conflict with us.
[4632.76 → 4634.92] In our relationship with Jesus Christ,
[4635.36 → 4637.04] there is only one wrong party.
[4637.90 → 4640.46] And there's no mystery about who's in the wrong.
[4641.92 → 4642.14] Okay?
[4642.18 → 4643.76] We have turned our back on him.
[4644.40 → 4646.12] We have betrayed him.
[4646.78 → 4649.22] And that is one area where we can say for sure
[4649.22 → 4651.04] that if someone is to blame, it is us.
[4651.98 → 4655.02] And yet, Jesus' heart was wide open to us.
[4655.32 → 4656.70] He loved us so much.
[4657.22 → 4660.52] He came even when we were his enemies,
[4660.66 → 4663.08] and he gave himself for us.
[4665.14 → 4668.56] And he loves us so much that he wants us to be reconciled with him.
[4669.28 → 4671.62] So Paul says to Christians and to non-Christians,
[4672.00 → 4673.32] be reconciled to God.
[4673.32 → 4679.84] You know, we may go to the judgment seat with experiencing disunity with other brothers and sisters.
[4680.40 → 4682.90] And however much that pains me, and it pains you.
[4683.44 → 4686.54] But we cannot go to the judgment seat of Christ,
[4687.20 → 4689.84] not being reconciled with God.
[4691.16 → 4693.84] But thanks be to God that through faith in Jesus Christ,
[4694.04 → 4698.02] he has restored our relationship with him.
[4698.78 → 4699.58] Thanks be to God.
[4699.58 → 4700.54] Let's pray together.
[4704.22 → 4706.70] Lord, we thank you again for your word.
[4707.84 → 4712.30] And Lord, we see the glorious realities of what it means to be reconciled to you
[4712.30 → 4714.86] and to one another through Christ.
[4714.86 → 4720.88] And yet, we sometimes see the painful realities of what it means to be flawed sinners.
[4722.32 → 4726.64] And sometimes, because of our fallenness, not being able to agree.
[4727.86 → 4733.06] And so, Lord, we ask that you would work among us to heal our divisions and our disunity.
[4734.06 → 4738.08] And we ask that you would give us the same love for you and for the gospel
[4738.08 → 4741.16] that we see here in Paul and Barnabas,
[4741.16 → 4744.26] that we too would be willing to stand upon what we believe
[4744.26 → 4748.00] and what we believe you are asking of us to do.
[4748.52 → 4752.08] And Lord, we pray all these things, Lord, seeking your wisdom,
[4752.72 → 4755.74] your help, your spirit to be at work within us.
[4756.22 → 4758.34] In Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[4758.34 → 4763.04] Please rise.
[4763.04 → 4792.50] We are one in the Spirit,
[4792.50 → 4798.56] We are one in the Spirit,
[4798.56 → 4801.50] We are one in the love.
[4801.50 → 4807.46] And we pray that all unity will not make me be so.
[4807.72 → 4811.98] We will know we are Christians by our love.
[4811.98 → 4818.06] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4818.06 → 4848.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4848.04 → 4849.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4849.04 → 4850.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4850.04 → 4852.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4852.04 → 4854.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4854.04 → 4856.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4856.04 → 4858.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4858.04 → 4863.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4863.04 → 4868.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4868.04 → 4880.04] By our love, yes, we'll know we are Christians by our love.
[4880.04 → 4886.14] All praise to the Father, all the Lord, all things come.
[4886.52 → 4892.14] And all praise to Christ Jesus, His only Son.
[4892.48 → 4898.20] And all praise to the Spirit, His name just come.
[4898.20 → 4904.32] And they'll know me, our Christians, by our love, by our love.
[4904.58 → 4909.58] Yes, they'll know me, our Christians, by our love.
[4910.04 → 4925.46] I think some Christians we want to love well are the Humans.
[4926.18 → 4931.78] They are a missionary couple that we, family that we support working in Egypt.
[4932.32 → 4935.00] And I think they just came out with a new prayer letter.
[4935.10 → 4937.18] I think that's available on the foyer table.
[4937.64 → 4938.82] And, you know, it's really great.
[4938.82 → 4941.32] We don't support, we support our denomination.
[4941.62 → 4948.24] There are a couple of missionaries by name, you know, Todd Stat ham, the Humans, that we support in particular.
[4948.44 → 4949.60] And they do send out prayer letters.
[4949.70 → 4956.28] It's good if we could know what's going on in their ministries, pray for them specifically, you know, for ourselves.
[4956.38 → 4960.18] So I encourage you to grab a newsletter, find out how we can pray.
[4960.18 → 4964.60] And today we will be, our designated offering is for their ministry.
[4965.10 → 4970.36] So may I invite or ask the deacons to come forward and collect the offering.
[4970.36 → 4970.46] Thank you.
[4970.46 → 4972.56] Thank you.
[4972.56 → 4992.76] Thank you.
[4992.76 → 4994.76] Amen.
[5022.76 → 5024.76] Amen.
[5052.76 → 5054.76] Amen.
[5082.76 → 5084.76] Amen.
[5084.76 → 5089.60] Let's lift a prayer of supplication to the Lord,
[5090.12 → 5092.22] praying for some of the needs in the world
[5092.22 → 5094.98] and some of the needs in our own congregation.
[5095.44 → 5096.60] Would you please join me in prayer?
[5097.56 → 5100.32] Lord, we come before you as your people,
[5101.30 → 5101.76] humbly,
[5102.94 → 5106.12] realizing that all that we have,
[5106.12 → 5108.08] all that we have become
[5108.08 → 5110.72] because of what you have done for us
[5110.72 → 5112.72] is solely by your grace.
[5113.54 → 5115.76] So, Lord, we have nothing to be proud of.
[5116.28 → 5119.02] We have everything to be thankful for.
[5119.78 → 5121.58] And, Lord, you have worked in our lives
[5121.58 → 5124.88] as much as you have also worked in the lives
[5124.88 → 5128.42] of our fellow sisters and brothers in the faith.
[5130.22 → 5133.52] And so, Lord, would you unite us together in unity?
[5133.60 → 5136.34] We thank you that there is so much that we share,
[5137.08 → 5139.86] so much of what is essential about the faith
[5139.86 → 5141.94] that we agree on,
[5141.94 → 5146.60] but, Lord, there are times when we disagree.
[5147.70 → 5150.76] Lord, and we do so not out of
[5150.76 → 5154.20] spitefulness toward one another,
[5154.32 → 5157.34] but just because we think this is what you are telling us.
[5157.40 → 5157.96] And so, Lord,
[5159.10 → 5161.28] would you help us know what is essential
[5161.28 → 5162.28] and what is not?
[5162.28 → 5164.84] Would you help us to know when
[5164.84 → 5167.94] to stand on the truth of your word
[5167.94 → 5170.50] and when, Lord, to allow for differences of opinion?
[5171.88 → 5173.08] Lord, we need that
[5173.08 → 5177.82] as much as it was needed in the very first century
[5177.82 → 5178.74] as it is today.
[5179.94 → 5180.90] And so, Lord, would you,
[5181.22 → 5182.60] by your spirit, continue to work.
[5182.66 → 5184.10] And, Lord, you are the God who is reconciling
[5184.72 → 5187.58] people to yourself and to us together.
[5187.58 → 5188.86] So, Lord, we have so much hope.
[5189.12 → 5190.42] We have so much hope for the church
[5190.42 → 5192.52] because you are the Lord of the church.
[5193.64 → 5195.58] Lord, and we also now turn our hearts
[5196.14 → 5197.46] and our thoughts around the world.
[5197.62 → 5199.90] Lord, we read recently about the earthquake in Turkey.
[5201.02 → 5203.40] Lord, the people trapped up in mountain villages.
[5203.90 → 5204.90] Lord, would you have mercy?
[5205.86 → 5207.70] Would you visit them in their distress?
[5208.08 → 5211.02] Would you send rescuers to help find people who are trapped?
[5211.02 → 5214.76] Lord, would you provide aid where it is needed?
[5215.64 → 5217.56] Lord, we also pray for the Humans
[5217.56 → 5219.00] and their ministry in Egypt.
[5219.94 → 5222.08] Lord, we thank you for the expansion of their ministry
[5222.08 → 5227.82] and having national believers join them
[5227.82 → 5232.72] and take roles of service among them in their ministry.
[5232.72 → 5236.86] Lord, be with Anne as she preaches.
[5237.48 → 5242.14] And, Lord, would you just continue to provide
[5242.14 → 5244.46] all that they need to continue the work.
[5245.58 → 5249.02] Lord, we look to our own needs in our own congregation.
[5249.24 → 5251.10] Lord, would you continue to be with Wilma
[5251.10 → 5252.20] and the Van Toole family
[5252.20 → 5255.44] as they grieve the passing of John
[5255.44 → 5258.16] and as they continue to rejoice, Lord,
[5258.20 → 5259.42] in the life that you have given him
[5259.42 → 5260.74] and the faith that you have given him,
[5260.74 → 5263.56] that he is, even right now,
[5264.06 → 5266.20] worshipping with us at your side.
[5267.80 → 5270.44] Lord, we pray for those who are
[5270.44 → 5272.48] maybe even approaching death.
[5272.68 → 5274.40] Lord, we lift Joyce DeVos to you
[5274.40 → 5278.20] who seems to be in her final days.
[5278.32 → 5280.22] Lord, we pray that you would give her
[5280.22 → 5282.44] immense comfort in her spirit
[5282.44 → 5287.26] to know of your presence with her even now
[5287.26 → 5289.58] and that you will be calling her
[5289.58 → 5291.92] into eternal glory in your own time.
[5292.22 → 5295.32] We pray for Jim and their whole family,
[5295.68 → 5297.98] Lord, as they go through this process
[5297.98 → 5299.44] and they seek to be with Joyce.
[5301.06 → 5306.52] Lord, we today also want to pray for Angela McKenzie
[5306.52 → 5309.18] who needs your healing.
[5310.34 → 5311.76] Lord, we don't know why
[5311.76 → 5315.56] suddenly our health turns
[5315.56 → 5317.66] for the worse.
[5319.14 → 5322.02] But Lord, we know we live in a fallen world
[5322.02 → 5324.44] and things fall apart, including our bodies.
[5325.84 → 5328.42] And so, Lord, but we know it is
[5328.42 → 5330.46] only for a little while
[5330.46 → 5334.90] and that eternity and glory
[5334.90 → 5336.58] are so much greater.
[5336.98 → 5339.80] But Lord, even now we live in this time
[5339.80 → 5341.12] and we love people
[5341.12 → 5343.12] and we don't want to see people be sick.
[5343.22 → 5344.66] And so, Lord, would you be with Angela
[5344.66 → 5345.68], and would you heal her?
[5346.80 → 5347.66] Lord, be with Colin
[5347.66 → 5348.76] and be with their children
[5348.76 → 5349.76] and their family too
[5349.76 → 5352.50] as they seek to love and care for Angela.
[5353.26 → 5356.62] Lord, be with Amy Iron as well.
[5356.76 → 5358.20] Lord, we ask for her healing.
[5359.16 → 5360.44] And Lord, for others,
[5360.68 → 5364.04] Lord, who need your healing care in their lives.
[5364.14 → 5366.10] Lord, we lift them up to you in our hearts.
[5366.24 → 5367.18] We lift them up to you,
[5367.70 → 5370.86] to the shepherd who loves and cares for all of us.
[5371.44 → 5373.54] And Lord, we pray all of these things in Jesus' name.
[5374.18 → 5374.48] Amen.
[5376.16 → 5377.00] Please rise.
[5377.56 → 5381.06] And we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5381.08 → 5383.14] And I want to remind you to join us
[5383.14 → 5383.94] in the Fellowship Hall
[5383.94 → 5386.58] as we celebrate Mustafa and Fou.
[5386.58 → 5389.62] And I think maybe they are preparing the cake.
[5390.00 → 5390.26] I don't know.
[5390.84 → 5391.08] Okay.
[5391.80 → 5394.20] So I want to invite you to stretch out your hands
[5394.20 → 5396.78] to receive the Lord's good word,
[5396.92 → 5397.96] benediction over you.
[5398.70 → 5401.24] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more
[5401.24 → 5402.68] than all we ask or imagine,
[5403.28 → 5404.74] according to his power
[5404.74 → 5406.18] that is at work within us,
