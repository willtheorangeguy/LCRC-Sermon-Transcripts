• Story of Lydia, a worshipper of the God of Israel who gladly opened her heart to the gospel
• Conversion story of the slave girl in Philippi, who was set free by the light of the gospel
• Acts 16 passage about Paul's missionary journey and conversions
• A female slave with a spirit predicting the future meets Paul and his companions
• The slave's owners try to capitalize on her abilities for financial gain
• Paul commands the spirit to leave the woman, which it does
• The owners become angry and seize Paul and Silas, dragging them before the authorities
• They are accused of causing an uproar by advocating customs unacceptable to Romans
• Paul and Silas are severely flogged and thrown into prison
• A passage from C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia is read to illustrate a similar theme of captivity and liberation
• The similarity between the story and the passage in Acts is noted, with Satan binding a girl to an evil spirit and Jesus setting her free
• A slave girl with a demonic spirit predicts the future and earns money for her owners through fortune-telling.
• The girl's situation is likened to being in bondage to both her demonic spirit and her owners, similar to someone struggling with addiction today.
• Paul and his companions are met by the girl on their way to prayer, and she yells out that they are servants of the Most High God who can help people be saved.
• The demon-possessed girl is unintentionally helping Paul and his companions evangelize, but likely does so as a form of deception.
• Paul ignores her for many days, possibly not wanting to draw attention to her or cause a scene.
• The narrator discusses a passage where a demon-possessed slave girl follows Paul and the gospel message, potentially damaging its reputation.
• Paul eventually casts out the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ, liberating the girl from its influence.
• The narrator suggests that the translators' interpretation of "annoyed" as "grieved" may be more accurate, implying Paul's distress over the girl's misery.
• Paul speaks to the spirit rather than the girl, indicating that he sees her as a vessel for the demon rather than the problem itself.
• There is no explicit account of the girl's conversion or baptism in Luke's narrative, but the narrator argues that it is likely she became a follower of Jesus and a member of the church in Philippi.
• The narrator provides two reasons for this conclusion: 
  • The power of exorcism in Jesus' ministry implies a "war" against Satan, with Jesus' victory bringing salvation to those freed from demon possession.
 • The narrative structure of Acts 16 suggests that Paul teaches the girl about Jesus, and she becomes converted.
• The second member of the church in Philippi, after Lydia, was a slave girl who practiced fortune-telling and made money for her owners.
• Paul and Silas were seized by the owners and charged with causing an uproar in the city due to their advocacy of customs "unlawful" for Romans to practice (xenophobia).
• The crowd joined in attacking them, they were beaten, and thrown into prison.
• This event occurred because the slave girl was set free from her bondage through Paul's ministry.
• God uses his people, including preachers like Paul, to open hearts and bring about conversions.
• The means by which God chooses to do this is often through the preaching of the gospel.
