• Introduction to a reading from Malachi and its application in daily life
• The speaker is from a church and discusses the topic of money during the season of Lent
• They are studying the book of Malachi, which talks about money
• The speaker wants to explore how financial lives relate to spiritual lives and if God cares about what people do with their money
• According to the prophet Malachi, people's love of money is keeping them from God
• God cares about how people use their money because it shows whether they are ready to return to Him or not
• The speaker makes two observations about the spiritual discipline of giving based on the passage:
  • Giving is bringing to God what's already his
  • This is emphasized in verse 8, which says "You rob me" implying that people are taking God's resources by force
• God owns everything and doesn't need anything from humans
• Humans often think God needs their offerings or tithes, but He doesn't
• Withholding tithe is considered robbing God in His eyes
• The concept of the tithe as a tenth of one's income or goods is rooted in biblical history and law
• Giving to God is not optional, it's a commandment in the Old Testament law.
• The tithe was given to God from crops and goods, supporting priests, annual feasts, and the poor.
• Withholding tithes is considered robbery and an act of violence against God.
• The biblical mindset on wealth is that everything belongs to God, and we are stewards of what remains after giving to him.
• Giving heals one's heart's relationship with money and shows a willingness to return to God.
• Money and the heart are linked, and serving God or serving money cannot coexist.
• Jesus teaches that you cannot serve God and money at the same time
• Money is a primary competitor to God in people's lives today, often taking priority over faith
• Withholding tithe from God indicates withholding one's heart from Him
• Reasons for withholding tithe include security, protection, pleasure, and happiness
• These are things that only God can ultimately give, making money a rival to God
• True issue is lack of trust in God and dependency on self for provision
• Many people struggle with giving to God due to fear, justification, or prioritizing own desires
• Giving to God requires surrender, dependency, and faith in His provision
• Trusting God with finances is a matter of faith and trust
• God does not change, He remains faithful to His people
• Tithing is about exercising faith in God's provision
• The ultimate blessing is found in God's gift of Jesus Christ
• Faithfulness is not the cause of receiving blessings, but rather a response to God's generosity
• The cross shows God's faithfulness in calling people back from idolizing money
• Giving to God is not just about finances but also trusting in Him for provision
• Christians are no longer commanded to give a tithe as it was under the Old Testament law
• New Testament guidelines for giving include being proportional, sacrificial, and joyful
• The amount given should be based on one's income and heart, with generosity and sacrifice being key principles
• The importance of returning to God and trusting in His generosity
