[305.00 --> 306.00]  Amen.
[308.00 --> 310.00]  Good morning, everyone.
[310.00 --> 311.00]  Good morning.
[311.00 --> 314.00]  Welcome this morning to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[314.00 --> 315.00]  My name is Jason.
[315.00 --> 318.00]  I'm one of the pastors here along with Nancy.
[318.00 --> 323.00]  And it is a joy to worship the Lord with you this morning on this beautiful day.
[323.00 --> 329.00]  And if you are new here today or if you are just visiting, we're really glad that you are here with us this morning.
[329.00 --> 338.54]  I want to extend a warm welcome to you. So we are gathered here to worship and adore our God.
[339.12 --> 346.34]  And friends, that is what we were made to do. You know, just like a planet revolving around the sun,
[346.44 --> 352.64]  this is what we were made for, for our lives to revolve around God, because he is the source of
[352.64 --> 360.08]  life. And he is the source of all things. And so the Lord this morning calls us to worship. He is always
[360.08 --> 366.76]  the one to initiate that. He is the one that calls us. And so let's hear him speak to us,
[367.16 --> 373.22]  and let us respond to this call to worship this morning from Psalm 50.
[373.22 --> 384.88]  The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets
[384.88 --> 394.82]  together. From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth. Our God comes and will not be silent.
[394.82 --> 402.74]  A fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages. He summons the heavens above
[402.74 --> 412.48]  and the earth that he may judge his people. Gather to me this consecrated people who made a covenant
[412.48 --> 421.76]  with me by sacrifice, and the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.
[421.76 --> 423.92]  Please pray with me.
[426.62 --> 435.70]  O triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, we proclaim that you are great. You are a God of justice.
[436.64 --> 442.36]  Lord, you are the judge of all the earth. And O Lord, your greatness is on display throughout your
[442.36 --> 450.88]  creation. The majestic mountains, the green forests, the flowing waters. We praise you for revealing
[450.88 --> 459.20]  yourself so magnificently in all of creation, the theater of your glory. And we adore you, O God,
[459.24 --> 466.78]  not only because you have created all things, including us, but we adore you because Jesus Christ
[466.78 --> 478.82]  has died for us. He has made us his own sons and daughters. O Lord, all of the sin and the guilt that we
[478.82 --> 487.92]  brought here, feeling the weight of today, Lord, you rolled that debt away, just as you rolled away
[487.92 --> 494.16]  that stone from the tomb when Jesus was risen. And so, Lord, we praise you that you have saved us
[494.16 --> 502.56]  and that you have made us your own. O Holy Spirit, we ask that you would engage our hearts this morning.
[502.56 --> 510.94]  Our hearts oftentimes are tired and they are anxious. And yet, Lord, would you make them alive
[510.94 --> 516.28]  by your spirit that we might see you in all of your glory and lift our hearts to you in praise.
[516.62 --> 522.68]  And we ask all of these things in Christ's holy name. Amen. Brothers and sisters, let's stand
[522.68 --> 529.14]  and hear God's greeting to us this morning from Job 33, verse 4. This is what God says,
[529.14 --> 537.86]  The Spirit of God has made me. The breath of the Almighty gives me life. Those are wonderful words.
[538.40 --> 543.38]  So as God has called us and has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another because God calls us to
[543.38 --> 549.20]  himself, but he doesn't call us just to be alone, but he calls us into a community. So let's greet one
[549.20 --> 551.20]  another.
[579.20 --> 580.02]  Amen.
[581.20 --> 582.50]  Amen.
[582.50 --> 583.02]  Amen.
[583.02 --> 583.62]  Amen.
[584.02 --> 584.52]  Amen.
[592.58 --> 594.52]  Amen.
[595.52 --> 596.02]  Amen.
[596.02 --> 596.12]  Amen.
[598.46 --> 598.52]  Amen.
[598.52 --> 599.68]  Amen.
[600.04 --> 600.58]  Amen.
[600.58 --> 602.06]  Amen.
[602.18 --> 602.82]  Amen.
[604.70 --> 605.22]  Amen.
[605.22 --> 605.94]  Amen.
[605.94 --> 606.50]  Amen.
[606.50 --> 606.60]  Amen.
[606.60 --> 606.64]  Amen.
[606.64 --> 608.04]  Amen.
[608.06 --> 608.56]  Amen.
[608.56 --> 608.68]  Amen.
[609.20 --> 632.12]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.
[632.12 --> 650.62]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[650.62 --> 670.62]  Holy, holy, holy, though the darkness hide thee, Though the eye made blind by sin, thy glory may not see.
[670.62 --> 689.86]  Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee, Perfect in power, in love and purity.
[689.86 --> 715.86]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, All thy works shall praise thy name In earth and sky and sea.
[715.86 --> 738.06]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[745.86 --> 753.76]  Thank you.
[757.84 --> 767.84]  And so today and at this time, we have the great privilege and honor of installing our three newly elected elders.
[767.84 --> 772.46]  and so may I invite them now to come on up.
[772.46 --> 776.34]  We have Jim DeVos, Andrew Limas, and Martin Hamming.
[790.68 --> 793.66]  So congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[793.66 --> 800.54]  today we celebrate God's gift of faithful leadership for his people.
[801.66 --> 805.34]  So out of his love for the church, he appoints leaders,
[806.14 --> 808.64]  and then by his Holy Spirit, he equips them
[808.64 --> 814.48]  so that we, as the congregation, may grow in faith in our Lord Jesus,
[814.68 --> 817.44]  that we might grow in love for one another,
[818.14 --> 820.92]  and that we might be equipped to serve one another
[820.92 --> 823.72]  and be on God's mission in the world,
[823.72 --> 827.22]  taking the good news of the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[828.24 --> 833.38]  And so elders serve by exercising spiritual oversight of the church,
[833.72 --> 838.20]  by caring for the spiritual well-being of God's people.
[839.04 --> 841.78]  And so they must provide instruction in the word.
[842.60 --> 848.02]  They must promote fellowship and hospitality among us as believers.
[848.02 --> 851.38]  They must ensure good order in the church
[851.38 --> 854.58]  and encourage all of us to be witnesses
[854.58 --> 857.92]  of God's love and faithfulness to our neighbors.
[859.38 --> 862.34]  And that's a high calling.
[862.82 --> 864.28]  That's a difficult task.
[864.66 --> 868.68]  But we believe that Christ is the one that equips us.
[869.32 --> 870.70]  And so the task of elders
[870.70 --> 874.90]  is for those whom God calls, most importantly,
[874.90 --> 881.62]  and also he calls those who have a level of maturity and faith
[881.62 --> 885.30]  and who would be able to exercise their office
[885.30 --> 887.64]  with prayer and patience and humility.
[888.70 --> 891.66]  And so today we install Martin Hemming here in the middle,
[891.80 --> 895.18]  Jim DeVos, Andrew Limus, as elders of our congregation.
[895.18 --> 901.84]  And so brothers and sisters, in the presence of God
[901.84 --> 904.86]  and in the presence of this congregation,
[905.20 --> 907.66]  I'm going to ask you some questions.
[908.60 --> 911.50]  And when I'm done, I'll ask you four questions,
[911.78 --> 912.90]  and then I'll say, what is your answer?
[913.04 --> 914.86]  And you can respond, I do, God helping me.
[916.10 --> 919.18]  And we'll have them on the screen as well so we can all see.
[919.18 --> 924.18]  And so do you all believe that in the call of this congregation,
[924.42 --> 927.36]  God himself is calling you to this holy office?
[928.74 --> 929.62]  The next one.
[930.82 --> 932.74]  Do you believe that the Old and New Testaments
[932.74 --> 933.88]  are the word of God,
[934.18 --> 936.64]  the only infallible rule of faith and life?
[937.90 --> 941.06]  Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church,
[941.54 --> 943.82]  rejecting all teaching which contradicts them?
[944.90 --> 947.68]  And do you promise to do the work of your office faithfully,
[947.68 --> 949.76]  in a way worthy of your calling,
[950.16 --> 953.36]  and in submission to the government and discipline of this church?
[953.80 --> 954.82]  What is your answer?
[957.58 --> 958.02]  Okay.
[961.30 --> 963.36]  Okay, and so I will give you this charge.
[964.36 --> 966.68]  I charge you, elders of this church,
[966.94 --> 969.24]  to guard yourself in all the flock
[969.24 --> 971.58]  of which the Holy Spirit has made you an overseer.
[972.46 --> 974.44]  Be shepherds of the church of God,
[974.82 --> 977.06]  which Jesus bought with his own blood.
[977.68 --> 981.96]  Be a friend and Christ-like example to children.
[983.10 --> 986.10]  Give clear and cheerful guidance to young people.
[987.40 --> 992.02]  Encourage the aged to persevere in God's faithfulness.
[992.02 --> 995.48]  By word and example,
[995.48 --> 998.30]  bear up God's people in their pain and weaknesses,
[999.04 --> 1001.12]  and celebrate their joys with them.
[1001.78 --> 1004.66]  Be compassionate, yet firm and consistent,
[1005.28 --> 1006.68]  in rebuke and discipline.
[1007.62 --> 1010.12]  Know the scriptures, which are useful for teaching,
[1010.58 --> 1012.84]  rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.
[1012.84 --> 1016.74]  And would you pray continually for the church?
[1017.40 --> 1019.24]  And remember at all times
[1019.24 --> 1021.74]  that if you would truly give spiritual leadership
[1021.74 --> 1023.04]  in the household of faith,
[1023.26 --> 1026.74]  you must be completely mastered by your Lord.
[1026.74 --> 1030.12]  So now to you, the congregation,
[1031.12 --> 1032.32]  I'll ask you a question,
[1032.46 --> 1033.84]  and may I invite you to stand,
[1034.34 --> 1035.70]  if you are able,
[1036.58 --> 1038.08]  and also to make this vow.
[1039.22 --> 1040.80]  I charge you, people of God,
[1040.86 --> 1043.96]  to receive these elders as Christ's gift to the church.
[1044.46 --> 1045.34]  Hold them in honor.
[1046.16 --> 1047.56]  Take their counsel seriously.
[1048.48 --> 1051.06]  Respond to them with obedience and respect.
[1052.02 --> 1053.66]  Accept their help with thanks.
[1054.52 --> 1056.36]  Sustain them in prayer and encouragement.
[1057.12 --> 1060.34]  And acknowledge them as the Lord's servants among you.
[1061.02 --> 1061.92]  So do you, congregation,
[1062.24 --> 1065.32]  pledge to receive these elders as you have been charged?
[1066.10 --> 1066.86]  Thank you.
[1069.02 --> 1069.60]  You may be seated.
[1070.14 --> 1074.10]  And now may I invite our current elders
[1074.10 --> 1077.38]  and deacons to come forward,
[1077.38 --> 1079.84]  and we will lay hands on these brothers
[1079.84 --> 1082.18]  and pray for them.
[1104.24 --> 1104.80]  Okay.
[1105.74 --> 1106.72]  Let's pray together.
[1108.06 --> 1109.86]  Our merciful Father in heaven,
[1110.62 --> 1112.88]  we thank you that you have provided leaders
[1112.88 --> 1114.24]  to serve in our church.
[1115.44 --> 1117.26]  And Lord, as Martin, Jim, and Andrew
[1117.26 --> 1119.52]  assume the office of elder among us,
[1119.66 --> 1121.66]  we ask that you would fill them with your spirit,
[1122.48 --> 1123.66]  guide them with your wisdom,
[1124.84 --> 1126.72]  fill them with your grace.
[1127.56 --> 1130.60]  Lord, make each of them faithful workers in your vineyard,
[1130.84 --> 1132.60]  that your name would be honored,
[1132.60 --> 1136.16]  Lord, and that your church would be built up and served.
[1136.94 --> 1141.36]  And Lord, we ask and we pray in the name,
[1142.04 --> 1144.96]  that is the name above all names,
[1145.36 --> 1146.76]  the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1146.98 --> 1148.92]  We pray in his holy name.
[1149.42 --> 1149.74]  Amen.
[1149.74 --> 1149.82]  Amen.
[1151.02 --> 1151.52]  Okay.
[1159.00 --> 1160.84]  Maybe a round of applause would be appropriate.
[1160.84 --> 1161.32]  Amen.
[1161.32 --> 1161.42]  Okay.
[1161.42 --> 1162.94]  Maybe a round of applause would be appropriate.
[1162.94 --> 1163.44]  Okay.
[1163.44 --> 1164.78]  Thank you.
[1167.18 --> 1167.40]  Okay.
[1167.40 --> 1169.88]  So let's stand again and we'll sing our next song.
[1169.88 --> 1170.18]  Okay.
[1170.18 --> 1173.92]  So let's stand again and we'll sing our next song.
[1173.92 --> 1203.90]  Let's stand again and we'll sing our next song.
[1203.90 --> 1233.88]  Let's stand again and we'll sing our next song.
[1234.66 --> 1239.38]  Power and majesty, praise to the king.
[1240.04 --> 1248.24]  Boutions bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name.
[1249.38 --> 1253.38]  I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[1253.96 --> 1258.30]  Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[1258.30 --> 1265.70]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you
[1265.70 --> 1273.18]  Joy Jesus, my Savior
[1273.18 --> 1277.26]  Lord, there is none like you
[1277.26 --> 1282.32]  All of my days I want to praise
[1282.32 --> 1287.96]  The wonders of your mighty love
[1287.96 --> 1292.86]  My comfort, my shelter
[1292.86 --> 1296.64]  Tower of refuge and strength
[1296.64 --> 1301.20]  Let every breath, all that I am
[1301.20 --> 1306.72]  Never cease to worship you
[1306.72 --> 1312.18]  Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
[1312.18 --> 1317.16]  Power and majesty, praise to the King
[1317.16 --> 1321.06]  Mountains bow down and the seas roar
[1321.06 --> 1326.06]  At the sound of your name
[1326.06 --> 1330.90]  I sing for joy at the work of your hands
[1330.90 --> 1335.48]  Forever I love and forever I stand
[1335.48 --> 1342.38]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you
[1342.38 --> 1348.68]  May be seated
[1348.68 --> 1360.64]  So please join me now as we enter into a time of confession
[1360.64 --> 1368.68]  And today let's read together these words of confession from Psalm 51
[1368.68 --> 1370.42]  We'll read it responsibly
[1370.42 --> 1376.98]  Let's prepare our hearts to come before the Lord
[1376.98 --> 1380.02]  And let's pray these words together
[1380.02 --> 1381.62]  So I'll begin
[1381.62 --> 1384.16]  Have mercy on me, O God
[1384.16 --> 1387.36]  According to your unfailing love
[1387.36 --> 1390.00]  According to your great compassion
[1390.00 --> 1392.40]  Blot out my transgressions
[1392.40 --> 1395.16]  Wash away all my iniquity
[1395.16 --> 1397.82]  And cleanse me from my sin
[1397.82 --> 1401.72]  For I know my transgressions
[1401.72 --> 1401.76]  For I know my transgressions
[1401.76 --> 1404.76]  And my sin is always before me
[1404.76 --> 1409.14]  Against you, you only have I sinned
[1409.14 --> 1412.20]  And done what is evil in your sight
[1412.20 --> 1414.94]  So you are right in your verdict
[1414.94 --> 1417.98]  And justified when you judge
[1417.98 --> 1421.88]  Hide your face from my sins
[1421.88 --> 1424.44]  And blot out all my iniquity
[1424.44 --> 1428.62]  Create in me a pure heart, O God
[1428.62 --> 1432.16]  And renew a steadfast spirit within me
[1432.16 --> 1435.02]  Do not cast me from your presence
[1435.02 --> 1437.86]  Or take your Holy Spirit from me
[1437.86 --> 1441.68]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation
[1441.68 --> 1446.18]  And grant me a willing spirit to sustain me
[1446.18 --> 1448.68]  I want to invite us to now
[1448.68 --> 1451.98]  Just in the context
[1451.98 --> 1453.70]  In this time of worship
[1453.70 --> 1456.86]  To settle our hearts
[1456.86 --> 1458.90]  To come before our Heavenly Father
[1458.90 --> 1460.44]  And ask for his forgiveness
[1460.44 --> 1462.44]  His mercy in our lives
[1462.44 --> 1464.76]  Ask the Holy Spirit to renew us
[1464.76 --> 1465.50]  And to heal us
[1465.50 --> 1467.00]  Let's take a moment of silence
[1467.00 --> 1467.88]  Silent prayer
[1467.88 --> 1490.00]  Our Heavenly Father
[1490.00 --> 1491.90]  We thank you that your mercy
[1491.90 --> 1495.34]  Is so much more than we can ever imagine
[1495.34 --> 1497.94]  That in our sin
[1497.94 --> 1499.54]  You do not abandon us
[1499.54 --> 1501.90]  You do not turn your face from us
[1501.90 --> 1504.26]  But through and in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1504.26 --> 1506.10]  You forgive us
[1506.10 --> 1507.80]  Because of his death
[1507.80 --> 1509.64]  And his resurrection
[1509.64 --> 1513.56]  And Lord, we are hidden in you
[1513.56 --> 1515.86]  And we receive the righteousness of Christ
[1515.86 --> 1516.88]  On our behalf
[1516.88 --> 1519.44]  That we might know you
[1519.44 --> 1519.94]  And love you
[1519.94 --> 1520.80]  And worship you
[1520.80 --> 1522.22]  As our Heavenly Father
[1522.22 --> 1524.10]  And might do so
[1524.10 --> 1526.14]  Only because you first have loved us
[1526.14 --> 1527.68]  Lord, we thank you
[1527.68 --> 1530.36]  That you wash away our sins
[1530.36 --> 1531.26]  We thank you
[1531.26 --> 1532.72]  That you renew us daily
[1532.72 --> 1533.76]  By your Holy Spirit
[1533.76 --> 1536.86]  And so Lord
[1536.86 --> 1537.16]  We
[1537.16 --> 1538.90]  We now
[1538.90 --> 1540.56]  We rest in this grace
[1540.56 --> 1541.72]  That you
[1541.72 --> 1543.36]  So freely give to us
[1543.36 --> 1544.18]  And we thank you
[1544.18 --> 1544.74]  This morning
[1544.74 --> 1546.00]  In Jesus' name
[1546.00 --> 1546.46]  Amen
[1546.46 --> 1548.46]  Beloved of God
[1548.46 --> 1550.44]  Hear these words
[1550.44 --> 1551.54]  Of assurance
[1551.54 --> 1552.34]  Of God's grace
[1552.34 --> 1553.06]  To us
[1553.06 --> 1554.90]  From Ezekiel 36
[1554.90 --> 1557.82]  God says
[1557.82 --> 1558.88]  In response
[1558.88 --> 1559.98]  I will sprinkle
[1559.98 --> 1561.24]  Clean water on you
[1561.24 --> 1562.86]  And you will be clean
[1562.86 --> 1564.74]  I will cleanse you
[1564.74 --> 1566.20]  From all of your impurities
[1566.20 --> 1567.62]  And from all of your idols
[1567.62 --> 1570.18]  I will give you a new heart
[1570.18 --> 1572.06]  And put a new spirit in you
[1572.06 --> 1573.64]  I will remove from you
[1573.64 --> 1574.82]  Your heart of stone
[1574.82 --> 1577.44]  And give you a heart of flesh
[1577.44 --> 1580.10]  And I will put my spirit in you
[1580.10 --> 1581.10]  And move you
[1581.10 --> 1582.92]  To follow my decrees
[1582.92 --> 1584.42]  And to be careful
[1584.42 --> 1586.06]  To keep my laws
[1586.06 --> 1588.02]  Brothers and sisters
[1588.02 --> 1588.96]  Know that in Christ
[1588.96 --> 1589.96]  Your sins are forgiven
[1589.96 --> 1591.54]  And be at peace
[1591.54 --> 1592.90]  Thanks be to God
[1592.90 --> 1594.80]  Let's stand
[1594.80 --> 1596.04]  And let's sing
[1596.04 --> 1596.88]  This song
[1596.88 --> 1597.72]  Of God's mercy
[1597.72 --> 1598.30]  And it's called
[1598.30 --> 1599.70]  His mercy is more
[1599.70 --> 1600.60]  Let's sing together
[1600.60 --> 1612.64]  What love could remember
[1612.64 --> 1615.18]  No wrongs we have done
[1615.18 --> 1617.34]  A mission told
[1617.34 --> 1619.14]  Knowing he counts
[1619.14 --> 1620.54]  Not their son
[1620.54 --> 1623.06]  Thrown into the sea
[1623.06 --> 1626.30]  Without bottom or shore
[1626.30 --> 1629.70]  Our sins they are many
[1629.70 --> 1632.30]  His mercy is more
[1632.30 --> 1638.20]  What patience would wait
[1638.20 --> 1640.74]  As we constantly roam
[1640.74 --> 1643.24]  What father so tender
[1643.24 --> 1645.68]  Is calling us home
[1645.68 --> 1648.28]  He welcomes the weakest
[1648.28 --> 1650.90]  The fondest the poor
[1650.90 --> 1654.40]  Our sins they are many
[1654.40 --> 1657.12]  His mercy is more
[1657.12 --> 1659.72]  Praise the Lord
[1659.72 --> 1660.94]  Praise the Lord
[1660.94 --> 1664.36]  His mercy is more
[1664.36 --> 1669.56]  Stronger than darkness
[1669.56 --> 1671.92]  Through every morn
[1671.92 --> 1674.44]  Our sins they are many
[1674.44 --> 1677.24]  His mercy is more
[1677.24 --> 1682.80]  What riches of kindness
[1682.80 --> 1685.14]  He lavished on us
[1685.14 --> 1687.62]  His blood was a payment
[1687.62 --> 1690.12]  His life was a cost
[1690.12 --> 1692.22]  We sternly protect
[1692.22 --> 1695.12]  We could never afford
[1695.12 --> 1698.76]  Our sins they are many
[1698.76 --> 1701.40]  His mercy is more
[1701.40 --> 1704.24]  Praise the Lord
[1704.24 --> 1709.00]  His mercy is more
[1709.00 --> 1710.74]  kernels of his death
[1710.74 --> 1711.60]  evet
[1711.60 --> 1725.56]  lab
[1725.56 --> 1728.14]  His mercy is more.
[1731.26 --> 1735.92]  Stronger than darkness to every Lord,
[1735.92 --> 1738.56]  but since they are made,
[1738.90 --> 1741.86]  His mercy is more.
[1755.56 --> 1765.62]  Brothers and sisters,
[1765.62 --> 1769.48]  we come now to the table of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1770.32 --> 1775.84]  This is a place where we taste the grace of our Lord Jesus.
[1776.46 --> 1779.66]  He knows that sometimes we struggle to believe in Him.
[1780.58 --> 1782.56]  He knows that we are weak and foolish,
[1783.32 --> 1784.20]  and yet He says,
[1784.20 --> 1786.26]  I am going to meet you here.
[1788.60 --> 1789.20]  Why?
[1790.14 --> 1791.46]  Because we need it.
[1792.24 --> 1796.60]  You need, God says, a reminder of my love.
[1797.64 --> 1798.48]  And the Lord Jesus,
[1798.62 --> 1802.22]  He instructed His disciples to remember Him through this meal.
[1802.72 --> 1805.98]  And He promised that this meal is a means of grace.
[1806.46 --> 1809.98]  It's a way by which God strengthens us spiritually,
[1810.28 --> 1812.56]  and that He abides with us as people.
[1812.56 --> 1814.54]  And so we take this meal.
[1814.68 --> 1818.66]  As we do so, we need to know who this meal is for.
[1819.30 --> 1824.58]  That this meal is for those who follow Jesus Christ and who believe in Him.
[1825.32 --> 1827.78]  Those who have been baptized in His name,
[1827.78 --> 1831.68]  and who believe that He is King.
[1832.18 --> 1835.42]  Now, if that is not you this morning,
[1835.88 --> 1837.86]  we are so glad that you are here.
[1837.86 --> 1842.60]  But we also ask that you not take the bread and the juice,
[1842.84 --> 1844.08]  even as they are passed to you.
[1844.20 --> 1847.22]  But instead, we invite you to pray.
[1847.34 --> 1850.02]  We invite you to consider God's invitation
[1850.02 --> 1854.30]  of love and forgiveness and grace to you.
[1854.30 --> 1859.46]  And He invites you to welcome Him into your life
[1859.46 --> 1863.22]  and to trust in Him as your Savior and Lord.
[1863.74 --> 1865.50]  That is His desire for you.
[1867.02 --> 1870.24]  But friends, if you have confessed Jesus Christ as Lord,
[1870.36 --> 1871.66]  then this meal is for you.
[1871.94 --> 1873.92]  And you need this.
[1874.32 --> 1875.26]  I need this.
[1875.72 --> 1877.36]  And so let's eat this meal together,
[1877.56 --> 1879.20]  seeking God's face.
[1879.20 --> 1881.64]  So the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1882.24 --> 1884.26]  on the night when He was betrayed,
[1884.40 --> 1885.18]  He took bread.
[1885.84 --> 1887.12]  And when He had given thanks,
[1887.18 --> 1887.90]  He broke it.
[1888.30 --> 1889.00]  And He said,
[1889.58 --> 1891.38]  This is my body, which is for you.
[1892.08 --> 1893.68]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1894.94 --> 1896.50]  In the same way, after supper,
[1896.66 --> 1897.70]  He took the cup,
[1898.14 --> 1898.40]  saying,
[1898.52 --> 1900.68]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1901.44 --> 1903.10]  For as often as you drink it,
[1904.02 --> 1906.62]  do it in remembrance of me.
[1906.62 --> 1908.26]  For as often,
[1908.84 --> 1910.24]  whenever you eat this bread
[1910.24 --> 1911.34]  and you drink this cup,
[1911.84 --> 1913.40]  you proclaim the Lord's death
[1913.40 --> 1915.28]  until He comes again.
[1917.38 --> 1918.74]  So brothers and sisters,
[1918.90 --> 1921.46]  let's say our words
[1921.46 --> 1923.40]  of the communion liturgy together.
[1924.14 --> 1925.12]  Lift up your hearts.
[1925.82 --> 1929.38]  We are His people.
[1932.06 --> 1934.50]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1934.50 --> 1936.22]  Christ has died.
[1936.76 --> 1937.66]  Christ is risen.
[1938.26 --> 1939.64]  Christ will come again.
[1940.14 --> 1941.18]  Christ, our Passover,
[1941.68 --> 1943.72]  has been sacrificed for us.
[1944.08 --> 1944.44]  Hallelujah.
[1945.28 --> 1945.80]  Hallelujah.
[1946.12 --> 1947.04]  Brothers and sisters,
[1947.20 --> 1948.82]  these are the gifts of God
[1948.82 --> 1950.70]  for you, the people of God.
[1951.52 --> 1953.62]  And God invites us,
[1953.68 --> 1954.48]  He bids us,
[1954.84 --> 1956.56]  to feed on Him by faith
[1956.56 --> 1958.22]  with thanksgiving in our hearts
[1958.22 --> 1960.08]  and drink,
[1960.40 --> 1962.00]  remembering that the blood of Christ
[1962.00 --> 1963.90]  was shed for us.
[1964.96 --> 1965.68]  So may I
[1965.68 --> 1970.18]  call our elders,
[1970.42 --> 1971.46]  whatever the word is,
[1971.86 --> 1973.24]  invite, welcome them up
[1973.24 --> 1975.68]  to help us serve the elements.
[1975.68 --> 1981.44]  So as the elements are served,
[1981.54 --> 1981.72]  friends,
[1981.78 --> 1983.42]  this is a time for you to
[1983.42 --> 1985.30]  pray to God,
[1985.46 --> 1986.18]  as we've said,
[1986.42 --> 1987.54]  lift up your hearts to God
[1987.54 --> 1989.20]  to pray and also to sing.
[1989.80 --> 1992.46]  And so let's take this again
[1992.46 --> 1993.50]  in faith.
[1993.50 --> 1993.62]  Amen.
[1993.62 --> 1993.98]  Amen.
[1993.98 --> 1994.10]  Amen.

[2411.54 --> 2418.92]  to die on a cross in our place, to live the life that we should have lived and die the death that we should have died.
[2420.36 --> 2426.16]  And Lord, we thank you that even now, though he has ascended into heaven, he has poured out his Holy Spirit
[2428.00 --> 2435.68]  to indwell us, to abide with us, to empower us, to follow Christ faithfully.

[2529.84 --> 2532.84]  Have you ever, have any of you had a sunburn before?
[2532.84 --> 2533.84]  Yeah.

[2540.84 --> 2541.84]  Yeah.
[2541.84 --> 2542.84]  That's not a sunburn.
[2542.84 --> 2543.84]  That's a scratch.
[2543.84 --> 2544.84]  But yeah, you know.
[2544.84 --> 2546.84]  So, have you been sunburned already this year?
[2546.84 --> 2547.84]  Yeah.
[2547.84 --> 2548.84]  Some of you have.
[2548.84 --> 2549.84]  You know what?
[2549.84 --> 2555.84]  I was out in a boat and I, I forgot that my knees were exposed.
[2555.84 --> 2558.84]  And I was just sitting out there on the water for a couple of hours.
[2558.84 --> 2560.84]  And you know what happened?
[2560.84 --> 2561.84]  It got really burnt.
[2561.84 --> 2562.84]  It turned bright red.
[2562.84 --> 2563.84]  And then it hurt.
[2563.84 --> 2565.84]  Anyways, it was quite, it was quite uncomfortable.
[2565.84 --> 2566.84]  Hot water hurts as well.
[2566.84 --> 2572.84]  Oh, oh, are you okay over there?
[2572.84 --> 2577.84]  Oh, we might need, we might need help.
[2577.84 --> 2586.84]  A rescuer.
[2586.84 --> 2587.84]  Okay.
[2587.84 --> 2590.84]  So, why am I talking about sunburns?
[2590.84 --> 2596.84]  It made me think of this passage in the book of Ephesians.
[2596.84 --> 2597.84]  Because you know what?
[2597.84 --> 2602.84]  In your Sunday school this summer, you are studying about the armor of God.
[2602.84 --> 2603.84]  Did you know that?
[2603.84 --> 2604.84]  So, the armor of God.
[2604.84 --> 2605.84]  And so, this is what it says.
[2605.84 --> 2612.84]  Therefore, put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground.
[2612.84 --> 2624.84]  And then it talks about putting on the belt of truth and the shoes of, the breastplate of peace, of righteousness, and the shield of faith, and all these things.
[2624.84 --> 2629.84]  And so, when I was thinking about that, you know, we need to put on protection.
[2629.84 --> 2632.84]  Just like you need to put on sunscreen on your knees so you don't get sunburned, right?
[2632.84 --> 2633.84]  Yeah.
[2633.84 --> 2635.84]  I have sunscreen.
[2635.84 --> 2636.84]  I have sunscreen.
[2636.84 --> 2637.84]  You have sunscreen?
[2637.84 --> 2638.84]  I have sunscreen.
[2638.84 --> 2639.84]  You have sunscreen?
[2639.84 --> 2640.84]  And you've learned about this story before.
[2640.84 --> 2641.84]  Good.
[2641.84 --> 2646.84]  And so, just like we need to put sunscreen on to protect us so we don't get burned.
[2646.84 --> 2647.84]  Yeah.
[2647.84 --> 2652.84]  So, when you put on your sunscreen, I want you to remember that we also need to put on the armor of God.
[2652.84 --> 2656.84]  We need to put on faith, and righteousness, and peace, and all these things.
[2656.84 --> 2657.84]  We have to put them on.
[2657.84 --> 2659.84]  They don't just happen naturally.
[2659.84 --> 2665.84]  Naturally, if we don't put them on, you know, we have to be able to stand against the evil one, okay?
[2665.84 --> 2666.84]  So, can you remember that?
[2666.84 --> 2672.84]  Next time you put on sunscreen, when you go swimming, sunscreen, I want you to also remember you need to put on the armor of God.
[2672.84 --> 2673.84]  Okay?
[2673.84 --> 2674.84]  Can you do that?
[2674.84 --> 2675.84]  All right.
[2675.84 --> 2676.84]  Let's pray.
[2676.84 --> 2680.84]  Father, we thank you that you've given us armor to protect us.
[2680.84 --> 2685.84]  Lord, we thank you that you are powerful, that you are willing to protect us.
[2685.84 --> 2695.84]  Lord, help us to put on this armor of God, to put on faith, and hope, and righteousness that only comes to us by your Holy Spirit.
[2695.84 --> 2697.84]  Lord, help each of us to do that.
[2697.84 --> 2699.84]  And we pray in Jesus' name.
[2699.84 --> 2700.84]  Okay.
[2700.84 --> 2701.84]  Thanks for listening.
[2701.84 --> 2706.84]  And if you are grade one or below, you can go to Sunday school.
[2706.84 --> 2707.84]  All right.
[2707.84 --> 2708.84]  See ya.
[2708.84 --> 2709.84]  You're grade two?
[2709.84 --> 2710.84]  Well...
[2710.84 --> 2711.84]  I am grade one.
[2711.84 --> 2712.84]  You're grade one?
[2712.84 --> 2713.84]  You can go.
[2713.84 --> 2714.84]  I am grade two.
[2714.84 --> 2715.84]  I am grade one.
[2715.84 --> 2716.84]  I am grade one.
[2716.84 --> 2717.84]  Maybe they make allowances.
[2717.84 --> 2718.84]  We don't...
[2718.84 --> 2719.84]  We don't know.
[2719.84 --> 2720.84]  You guys go.
[2720.84 --> 2721.84]  Just do whatever your parents say.
[2721.84 --> 2722.84]  It's fine.
[2722.84 --> 2723.84]  Thank you.
[2744.84 --> 2760.48]  I'll be reading from Acts chapter 13, the verses 1 through 12.
[2760.48 --> 2764.28]  You can find this on page 821 in your pew Bible.
[2769.54 --> 2773.40]  Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers.
[2773.40 --> 2781.98]  Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaan, who had been brought up with Herod
[2781.98 --> 2784.16]  the Tetrarch, and Saul.
[2784.16 --> 2792.10]  While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas
[2792.10 --> 2794.90]  and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
[2795.46 --> 2801.00]  So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
[2801.00 --> 2808.30]  The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from
[2808.30 --> 2809.58]  there to Cyprus.
[2809.58 --> 2816.22]  When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues.
[2816.22 --> 2819.96]  John was with them as their helper.
[2819.96 --> 2823.58]  They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos.
[2823.58 --> 2830.58]  There, they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, who was an attendant
[2830.58 --> 2833.16]  of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus.
[2833.16 --> 2839.92]  The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear
[2839.92 --> 2841.88]  the word of God.
[2841.88 --> 2847.64]  But Elymas the sorcerer, for that is what his name means, opposed them and tried to turn
[2847.64 --> 2850.68]  the proconsul from the faith.
[2850.68 --> 2857.88]  Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas
[2857.88 --> 2865.20]  and said, You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right.
[2865.20 --> 2868.82]  You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery.
[2868.82 --> 2873.62]  Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
[2873.62 --> 2876.20]  Now the hand of the Lord is against you.
[2876.20 --> 2882.70]  You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.
[2882.70 --> 2888.28]  Immediately a mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to
[2888.28 --> 2890.64]  lead him by the hand.
[2890.64 --> 2897.08]  When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching
[2897.08 --> 2899.62]  about the Lord.
[2899.62 --> 2903.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2903.52 --> 2916.80]  Thank you, Bev.
[2916.80 --> 2922.36]  And would you pray with me as we come before God's word together?
[2922.36 --> 2927.24]  Let's pray.
[2927.24 --> 2932.60]  Holy Spirit, would you open our eyes to see the truth of your word?
[2932.60 --> 2937.46]  Would you open our hearts to believe and to respond in faith?
[2937.46 --> 2940.54]  And would you bring glory to the Father and the Son?
[2940.54 --> 2943.36]  Through the preaching of your word this morning, we pray.
[2943.36 --> 2945.24]  In Jesus name, amen.
[2945.24 --> 2950.08]  Well, there's this saying that's called, well, it's not called, but there's a saying that
[2950.08 --> 2954.62]  is, it is easy to miss the forest for the trees.
[2954.62 --> 2955.62]  Right?
[2955.62 --> 2956.62]  Have you heard that one?
[2956.62 --> 2958.62]  Like sometimes we miss the forest for the trees.
[2958.62 --> 2965.80]  And in other words, it's easy to be so focused on the details, focused on so much what is right
[2965.80 --> 2970.74]  in front of us that we lose sight of the big picture.
[2970.74 --> 2976.28]  And there's a modern parable, maybe you've heard of it, that says it's kind of, it's
[2976.28 --> 2981.12]  easy to miss the cathedral for the individual bricks.
[2981.12 --> 2988.96]  So there was a man walking along one day and he came across three workers, all laying bricks
[2988.96 --> 2990.80]  to make a wall.
[2990.80 --> 2994.12]  He asked the first man, what are you doing?
[2994.12 --> 2999.76]  And the first man's reply was quite simply, I am laying bricks.
[2999.76 --> 3001.50]  He went on to the second man.
[3001.50 --> 3003.50]  He asked him, what are you doing?
[3003.50 --> 3008.70]  The second man responded, I am building a wall.
[3008.70 --> 3013.40]  He continued on to the third man and he asked the third man the same question, what are you
[3013.40 --> 3014.40]  doing?
[3014.40 --> 3020.14]  And then the third man, you know, with a gleam in his eye, looked up and he said, I am constructing
[3020.14 --> 3024.78]  a grand cathedral.
[3024.78 --> 3029.04]  Now which of these three men answered the question correctly?
[3029.04 --> 3034.08]  Well, technically speaking, all three of them did, right?
[3034.08 --> 3038.48]  All three of them were laying bricks, all three of them were building a wall and all three
[3038.48 --> 3043.10]  of them actually were constructing a grand cathedral.
[3043.10 --> 3049.80]  But really only one of them saw the big picture and how we answered the question.
[3049.80 --> 3059.24]  It is so easy sometimes for us to miss the grand cathedral for the individual bricks.
[3059.24 --> 3062.48]  And I think this same kind of thing can happen.
[3062.48 --> 3067.62]  It can happen in our own lives and it can happen in the church.
[3067.62 --> 3072.90]  So if someone were to come up and ask, what are you doing?
[3072.90 --> 3074.80]  What are we doing?
[3074.80 --> 3077.02]  We might respond in different ways.
[3077.02 --> 3080.74]  We might say, I'm going to church.
[3080.74 --> 3085.42]  We might say, well, we're having a small group meeting.
[3085.42 --> 3087.52]  Or you know, I'm teaching Sunday school.
[3087.52 --> 3088.96]  I'm serving as a greeter, right?
[3088.96 --> 3092.46]  And those are all wonderful answers to the question.
[3092.46 --> 3096.04]  But they're also kind of like saying, I'm laying bricks.
[3096.04 --> 3104.48]  Because those are the kind of zoomed all the way in immediate things that we often do.
[3104.48 --> 3112.88]  So in our passage this morning in Acts chapter 13, what begins to happen is that God really begins
[3112.88 --> 3121.44]  to get his church to lift their gaze beyond the immediate, beyond this zoomed in perspective
[3121.44 --> 3122.88]  of their lives.
[3122.88 --> 3129.60]  And he lifts their gaze to see this awe-inspiring grand cathedral, big picture view.
[3130.56 --> 3135.76]  And so if we were to ask God, God, what are you doing?
[3136.88 --> 3138.98]  How do you think God would respond?
[3138.98 --> 3141.94]  How do you think God would respond?
[3141.94 --> 3148.58]  Well, I think based on what we see here in Acts, I think God's response would be, I am
[3148.58 --> 3151.88]  reaching the whole world with my love.
[3151.88 --> 3156.12]  I am reaching the whole world with my love.
[3156.12 --> 3162.56]  The mission of God, friends, the mission of God and the mission of God's people is to make
[3162.56 --> 3166.64]  Jesus Christ known everywhere to everyone.
[3167.52 --> 3170.16]  And that is really what begins to happen in the book of Acts.
[3170.96 --> 3175.70]  And so a church had been established in the city of Antioch, and we read about that in
[3175.70 --> 3176.50]  Acts chapter 11.
[3176.50 --> 3185.26]  And it is this multicultural church that for the first time had a large portion of Gentiles
[3185.26 --> 3185.74]  in it.
[3186.70 --> 3193.66]  And now in chapter 13, Antioch becomes like this launching pad for the rest of the book
[3193.66 --> 3194.02]  of Acts.
[3194.12 --> 3199.94]  You know, sometimes when, you know, SpaceX or NASA, SpaceX wants to go to Mars, right?
[3200.00 --> 3201.20]  NASA wants to go to the moon, maybe.
[3201.20 --> 3207.18]  And they all go to the Kennedy Airspace Center in Florida, Cape Canaveral, to launch the rocket
[3207.18 --> 3207.60]  ships.
[3208.18 --> 3212.86]  Well, in the same way, Antioch is like the launching pad for the gospel.
[3213.62 --> 3219.26]  So the apostle Paul and his associates are going to go on what are called missionary journeys,
[3220.14 --> 3220.30]  right?
[3220.36 --> 3224.72]  And these missionary journeys actually encompass the rest of the book of Acts, and they always
[3224.72 --> 3226.40]  go out from Antioch.
[3226.48 --> 3228.34]  It's always the launching pad for the gospel.
[3228.34 --> 3233.36]  So in chapter 13, this is the beginning of what is known as the first missionary journey.
[3234.10 --> 3239.62]  Paul and Barnabas are sent from the church in Antioch, and they sail to the island of
[3239.62 --> 3240.06]  Cyprus.
[3240.50 --> 3241.76]  So here's a photo.
[3242.16 --> 3244.62]  Here's a picture of modern day Cyprus.
[3245.14 --> 3248.34]  And you can see some of those ancient walls right there.
[3249.04 --> 3250.00]  And what do you think?
[3250.56 --> 3251.56]  It's pretty nice.
[3252.60 --> 3257.82]  I think maybe, you know, in your next summer vacation, you can consider going to Cyprus.
[3257.82 --> 3262.54]  And this is actually where Barnabas grew up.
[3262.72 --> 3263.92]  Not a bad place to grow up.
[3264.64 --> 3268.50]  And so earlier in Acts, we are told that Barnabas grew up on the island of Cyprus.
[3269.34 --> 3273.22]  And it's interesting, you know, in thinking about that, sometimes that's the way God works.
[3273.36 --> 3278.14]  Sometimes God uses us and sends us back home, right?
[3278.20 --> 3283.66]  Back to our families, back to our people of origin, when we've come to faith that we might
[3283.66 --> 3284.86]  share the gospel with them.
[3284.86 --> 3287.56]  And this is what is beginning to happen here.
[3287.84 --> 3290.36]  Barnabas, he's going to go back to his hometown.
[3291.10 --> 3294.30]  And so Paul and Barnabas are going to Cyprus, and they're not going on vacation.
[3295.42 --> 3296.34]  Maybe they'll take a dip.
[3296.38 --> 3296.78]  I don't know.
[3296.90 --> 3299.78]  But they're not going there on vacation, but they are going on a mission.
[3300.32 --> 3301.74]  They're going on a mission to preach the gospel.
[3301.74 --> 3303.38]  So here's a map.
[3303.96 --> 3307.48]  And this is a map that focuses on what we are looking at this morning.
[3307.60 --> 3309.78]  And so you can see Antioch up there.
[3310.30 --> 3314.24]  And what they're going to do is they go down to Seleucia, and then they sail from there
[3314.24 --> 3315.10]  to Cyprus.
[3315.32 --> 3318.50]  And they work their way through it from one side to the other.
[3318.72 --> 3320.04]  You can kind of see the red arrow there.
[3320.04 --> 3323.86]  And it says it's from Salamis to Paphos.
[3323.96 --> 3328.44]  And they go right across the island from one side to the other, and they just work their
[3328.44 --> 3328.86]  way through.
[3330.14 --> 3334.20]  And so as they do that on mission, what are they doing?
[3334.92 --> 3339.42]  Well, it says in verse 5, when they arrived, we got it up there.
[3339.42 --> 3345.86]  When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God.
[3346.44 --> 3346.56]  Right?
[3346.60 --> 3347.38]  That's what they were doing.
[3347.56 --> 3351.78]  They're simply going through, and they're preaching, and they're telling people the good
[3351.78 --> 3354.90]  news, the wonderful news about Jesus Christ.
[3355.80 --> 3360.62]  You know, and sometimes we can think that mission takes something very special.
[3361.34 --> 3363.88]  You know, maybe something, mission is something very unique.
[3363.88 --> 3370.56]  But I want us to see here that mission is just simply, faithfully sharing the word of God.
[3370.86 --> 3371.78]  That's what mission is.
[3371.90 --> 3373.56]  And we're all part of that mission.
[3373.68 --> 3376.96]  This isn't something that just pastors or religious workers do.
[3377.06 --> 3378.42]  This is all of the God's people.
[3379.18 --> 3382.90]  We are on mission to simply, faithfully share the word of God.
[3383.84 --> 3389.48]  And so as we look at the text this morning, what I want us to focus on is to look at what
[3389.48 --> 3393.54]  is the response from the people who heard the gospel.
[3393.88 --> 3394.50]  Right?
[3394.56 --> 3395.54]  Who heard about Jesus.
[3396.26 --> 3401.74]  And what we see here in Acts 13, and actually throughout the remainder of the book of Acts,
[3401.78 --> 3405.92]  as they go out on all these missionary journeys and all over the Roman Empire, what we see
[3405.92 --> 3413.72]  that is that, what we see is that in every synagogue, in every city and marketplace, and whenever
[3413.72 --> 3417.62]  they share the gospel, what we see is the response.
[3417.62 --> 3422.94]  And the response is, some people don't believe.
[3424.36 --> 3424.58]  Right?
[3424.64 --> 3426.86]  Many people are not interested in Jesus.
[3427.66 --> 3432.16]  But we also see some people were interested.
[3433.12 --> 3435.00]  Some people did believe.
[3436.06 --> 3441.16]  And so the question I want us to ask this morning, the question I want us to think about is simply
[3441.16 --> 3443.06]  this, why?
[3443.68 --> 3444.16]  Why?
[3444.78 --> 3450.60]  Why do some people hear the gospel and believe and others do not?
[3451.66 --> 3458.56]  And we learn the answer to that question here in Acts 13 from a somewhat surprising response
[3458.56 --> 3462.22]  of these two characters that we have here in our passage.
[3462.42 --> 3469.46]  We see this contrast between these two responses, and their responses couldn't be more different.
[3470.52 --> 3472.58]  Okay, so first, we're going to look at these two responses.
[3472.92 --> 3476.10]  First, let's look at the response of this guy, Elimus.
[3476.10 --> 3483.72]  And to the question, why do people not believe, the answer from Elimus is that people don't
[3483.72 --> 3485.86]  believe because of blindness.
[3486.80 --> 3487.08]  Right?
[3487.14 --> 3492.82]  The Bible teaches that all of us, because of original sin, we are actually born blind.
[3493.52 --> 3493.90]  Right?
[3493.96 --> 3497.24]  Not physically blind, but spiritually blind.
[3499.10 --> 3502.64]  You see, sin isn't just bad things that we do.
[3502.78 --> 3504.32]  I mean, it is that as well.
[3504.32 --> 3510.66]  But the problem of sin, fundamentally, is that it is a natural condition of the heart.
[3511.14 --> 3515.68]  And that condition is one of blindness to God and to the things of God.
[3516.52 --> 3521.44]  So listen to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, verse 14.
[3522.30 --> 3523.06]  He says this,
[3523.98 --> 3529.54]  The person without the Spirit does not accept the things of God that come from the Spirit
[3529.54 --> 3533.84]  of God, but considers them foolishness and cannot understand them.
[3534.32 --> 3536.60]  Because they are discerned only through the Spirit.
[3538.04 --> 3538.24]  Right?
[3538.32 --> 3543.26]  Right from birth, men, women, and children, we cannot see Jesus.
[3543.78 --> 3545.78]  We cannot move toward Jesus.
[3545.90 --> 3547.24]  We cannot believe in Jesus.
[3547.62 --> 3549.56]  We are spiritually blind.
[3549.56 --> 3552.50]  And we see that illustrated here in Acts 13.
[3553.28 --> 3558.88]  Paul and Barnabas, they leave Antioch, they travel to Cyprus, and then in verse 6, here's
[3558.88 --> 3559.54]  what it says.
[3560.26 --> 3563.72]  They travel through the whole island until they came to Paphos.
[3564.42 --> 3569.54]  There, they met a Jewish sorcerer and a false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
[3569.54 --> 3575.98]  So Bar, in Hebrew, it means son.
[3576.96 --> 3581.98]  And the name Jesus comes from the Hebrew Yeshua, which means salvation.
[3582.58 --> 3585.92]  And so this man, he's claiming to be a son of salvation.
[3586.06 --> 3587.20]  That's what Bar-Jesus means.
[3587.80 --> 3590.54]  And as a Jewish man, right, he says he's a Jewish sorcerer.
[3590.68 --> 3593.58]  As a Jewish man, he would have known the Hebrew scriptures.
[3593.58 --> 3601.72]  And since he's a magician, he's probably radically open to the supernatural and to its power.
[3602.38 --> 3609.08]  And so in some sense, this guy is a prime candidate for hearing the gospel of Jesus' power.
[3610.24 --> 3614.96]  But let's see what is his response to the gospel when it is preached to him.
[3615.54 --> 3618.18]  So it goes on in verse 7, and it says this.
[3618.18 --> 3621.18]  The procouncil, an intelligent man, and we'll get to him later,
[3621.18 --> 3625.96]  he sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
[3626.80 --> 3629.74]  But Elamus, the sorcerer, for that is what his name means,
[3630.30 --> 3636.20]  opposed them and tried to turn the procouncil from the faith.
[3637.44 --> 3643.46]  So why did Elamus, this Jewish magician, try to get the procouncil not to believe?
[3645.12 --> 3646.56]  Well, there's a couple of reasons.
[3646.56 --> 3650.56]  One reason is because of his livelihood, right?
[3650.56 --> 3653.60]  His livelihood is at stake here, right?
[3653.62 --> 3655.32]  So he was kind of like this court magician.
[3656.14 --> 3662.18]  His job was to facilitate divine guidance for the Roman governor of this island.
[3662.90 --> 3666.56]  And so Paul and Barnabas, they come in, right, claiming to speak for God,
[3666.94 --> 3669.06]  and they were kind of squeezing in on his turf, right?
[3669.06 --> 3674.68]  They were a threat to his profitable relationship with the procouncil.
[3675.74 --> 3679.72]  But Elamus, you know, he wasn't just opposed to the gospel for financial reasons.
[3680.28 --> 3684.24]  He was also, just like every one of us, he was spiritually blind.
[3685.16 --> 3686.72]  So let's look again at verse 11.
[3687.52 --> 3688.08]  It says,
[3688.08 --> 3707.26]  So here it says,
[3707.26 --> 3712.36]  The Lord physically blinded him,
[3712.36 --> 3720.34]  and that physical blinding is a sign to show him the reality of his darkened, crooked heart.
[3721.38 --> 3727.34]  You know, and it's actually also a picture of every human heart left in our fallen condition,
[3727.42 --> 3729.60]  this natural condition of our hearts, right?
[3729.60 --> 3730.92]  We grope around in the dark.
[3731.16 --> 3732.66]  We try to make sense of our lives.
[3732.96 --> 3738.36]  We try to find something to give us meaning and to worship and to give our hearts to,
[3738.46 --> 3742.80]  and we're spiritually blinded because of sin, not able to see God.
[3743.88 --> 3749.26]  And the other thing I want us to notice here is that sometimes people in their spiritual darkness
[3749.26 --> 3752.82]  actually oppose the message of the gospel.
[3753.96 --> 3756.66]  And we see that here with this man, Elamus,
[3756.66 --> 3762.30]  who seeks to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
[3762.38 --> 3762.98]  Do you see that?
[3763.48 --> 3765.52]  He seeks to turn him away from the faith, right?
[3765.56 --> 3768.56]  So it's not simply that he's a person who is struggling with faith,
[3768.66 --> 3771.02]  maybe not really convinced of who Jesus is himself,
[3771.02 --> 3777.58]  but actually he is a clear representation of demonic opposition to the advance of the gospel.
[3778.72 --> 3782.64]  And we know this because in verse 10 it says this.
[3783.64 --> 3784.08]  It says,
[3784.08 --> 3787.62]  Paul filled with the Holy Spirit, right, under the influence of the Spirit,
[3787.94 --> 3790.70]  looked straight at Elamus and said,
[3791.20 --> 3796.02]  you are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right.
[3796.74 --> 3797.50]  Not very diplomatic.
[3798.64 --> 3799.10]  He says,
[3799.16 --> 3801.96]  you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery.
[3801.96 --> 3805.98]  Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
[3807.36 --> 3808.70]  A little confrontational.
[3808.70 --> 3814.12]  But what this actually likely refers to is Isaiah 40.
[3814.90 --> 3820.04]  In Isaiah 40, God's people are weighed down by their sin and by God's judgment.
[3820.80 --> 3824.20]  And a prophet comes to prepare the people,
[3824.74 --> 3826.68]  to prepare the way of the Lord.
[3827.50 --> 3829.54]  And this finds fulfillment, friends,
[3829.90 --> 3832.98]  when John the Baptist comes to prepare the way for Jesus.
[3832.98 --> 3836.42]  So that people can receive Jesus.
[3837.34 --> 3837.62]  Right?
[3837.68 --> 3838.92]  This is what John the Baptist did.
[3839.28 --> 3842.66]  And then this man, Elamus, is actually doing the opposite of John the Baptist.
[3843.28 --> 3846.94]  So instead of preparing the right ways of the Lord,
[3847.08 --> 3847.40]  he is,
[3847.92 --> 3849.98]  so people can see and receive Jesus,
[3850.62 --> 3852.90]  he's coming to make those paths crooked.
[3853.44 --> 3856.54]  He's turning the proconsul away from the faith.
[3856.86 --> 3858.82]  He's causing doubt in the word of God.
[3858.82 --> 3860.68]  So Elamus,
[3861.12 --> 3861.58]  Elamus,
[3861.90 --> 3862.56]  I say it differently,
[3863.12 --> 3864.66]  is a false prophet.
[3865.24 --> 3865.46]  Right?
[3865.52 --> 3867.12]  The opposite of John the Baptist.
[3867.86 --> 3872.62]  He's making paths crooked to obscure people from seeing Jesus.
[3873.52 --> 3874.18]  And friends, you know what?
[3874.22 --> 3878.02]  This is the nature of all opposition to the gospel.
[3878.58 --> 3880.80]  It's to prevent the word of God,
[3881.00 --> 3883.36]  the truth of God being clearly shared,
[3883.80 --> 3886.06]  and to prevent people from believing in Jesus.
[3886.06 --> 3889.94]  And so Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[3890.16 --> 3892.34]  saw through Elamus.
[3892.70 --> 3894.64]  He saw right through his unbelief,
[3895.20 --> 3897.26]  his own spiritual blindness,
[3897.26 --> 3901.70]  and he saw to something that is actually darker and more demonic.
[3903.10 --> 3904.54]  Paul was essentially saying to him,
[3904.62 --> 3906.06]  you are not bar Jesus.
[3906.18 --> 3907.20]  You're not a son of Jesus.
[3907.36 --> 3909.18]  You are a son of the devil.
[3909.18 --> 3911.28]  So friends,
[3912.10 --> 3914.38]  why do some people not believe the gospel?
[3915.62 --> 3916.88]  Well, from what we learned here,
[3916.96 --> 3920.02]  is because sin makes us blind to who Jesus is,
[3920.48 --> 3921.90]  that he is King and Lord.
[3922.82 --> 3923.90]  And then in our blindness,
[3924.10 --> 3926.74]  people sometimes even oppose the gospel.
[3928.06 --> 3928.88]  And yet, you know what?
[3928.92 --> 3930.24]  For 2,000 years,
[3930.64 --> 3932.90]  while many have rejected the gospel,
[3933.58 --> 3934.88]  others have believed.
[3935.28 --> 3937.58]  All throughout the centuries around the world.
[3937.58 --> 3939.00]  And amazingly,
[3939.32 --> 3941.60]  even though there's this opposition
[3941.60 --> 3943.38]  that comes from Elamus,
[3944.26 --> 3945.10]  the proconsul,
[3945.18 --> 3946.70]  he's not turned away from faith,
[3947.14 --> 3950.26]  he actually ends up believing the gospel.
[3950.80 --> 3952.10]  And that's the second response,
[3952.18 --> 3952.98]  the final part,
[3953.30 --> 3955.46]  that we see here in our passage today,
[3955.54 --> 3956.68]  this Roman proconsul.
[3957.24 --> 3958.96]  And I find it fascinating
[3958.96 --> 3962.20]  the way it describes his conversion.
[3963.02 --> 3963.72]  Okay, so first of all,
[3963.80 --> 3964.54]  who is this guy?
[3964.62 --> 3965.24]  Who is this man?
[3965.24 --> 3968.36]  Well, we know that he's a Gentile.
[3969.00 --> 3972.72]  So he likely would have no biblical background,
[3973.36 --> 3974.78]  no knowledge of God.
[3975.56 --> 3978.18]  It tells us that he is highly intelligent.
[3979.24 --> 3981.78]  And that he is someone with a public profile.
[3981.96 --> 3983.74]  You know, people would know this guy.
[3983.84 --> 3987.46]  He is the proconsul of the island.
[3987.68 --> 3989.76]  So he also had a lot of political power.
[3990.14 --> 3992.42]  A proconsul was a Roman official
[3992.42 --> 3994.50]  who was placed over an entire province.
[3995.04 --> 3995.12]  Right?
[3995.18 --> 3997.92]  So he is the top Roman official
[3997.92 --> 3998.98]  on the island of Cyprus.
[3999.08 --> 4000.54]  He governs the entire island.
[4001.62 --> 4003.38]  And friends, to a man like this,
[4003.72 --> 4005.56]  you would imagine that the story
[4005.56 --> 4006.68]  of the Christian faith
[4006.68 --> 4008.52]  would be so incredulous.
[4009.54 --> 4009.78]  Right?
[4009.84 --> 4011.18]  That Jesus is God
[4011.18 --> 4013.10]  who took on flesh
[4013.10 --> 4015.08]  and came to live among us
[4015.08 --> 4016.14]  and who loved us
[4016.14 --> 4018.12]  even though we turned our back on him.
[4018.80 --> 4021.26]  And then Jesus willingly went to the cross
[4021.26 --> 4023.14]  for our sins,
[4023.52 --> 4025.36]  took all of our sins upon himself.
[4026.12 --> 4027.38]  And then three days later,
[4027.50 --> 4028.56]  death couldn't hold him.
[4028.64 --> 4029.56]  He rose again.
[4030.08 --> 4031.50]  And he's the Lord of all.
[4031.76 --> 4033.46]  He ascended to the right hand of God.
[4033.66 --> 4035.40]  And then he's actually going to come back one day
[4035.40 --> 4036.68]  to judge the living and the dead.
[4037.78 --> 4040.24]  And this Jewish magician is like,
[4040.64 --> 4042.74]  no, no, I don't want that.
[4042.80 --> 4043.78]  I don't believe that.
[4044.12 --> 4045.32]  But this proconsul,
[4046.38 --> 4047.16]  what does he do?
[4047.40 --> 4049.26]  He calls for Paul and Barnabas.
[4049.42 --> 4051.32]  He wants to hear the word of God.
[4052.46 --> 4053.28]  He's open.
[4054.42 --> 4055.92]  You know, maybe it's just his job
[4055.92 --> 4057.44]  to know what's going on in the island.
[4057.54 --> 4059.08]  So he wants to kind of interview these guys.
[4059.58 --> 4061.66]  But also, I think he's actually
[4061.66 --> 4063.18]  spiritually interested.
[4063.32 --> 4065.10]  He wants to hear what they have to say.
[4065.28 --> 4066.82]  He doesn't just get it secondhand.
[4066.82 --> 4070.58]  And so actually, even by the end of our passage
[4070.58 --> 4073.00]  in verse 12, he believes.
[4073.22 --> 4074.84]  He puts his faith in Jesus.
[4075.82 --> 4077.38]  So let's take a look at verse 12.
[4078.66 --> 4082.66]  It says, when the proconsul saw what had happened,
[4083.20 --> 4086.04]  so that refers to Elimus becoming blinded,
[4087.02 --> 4090.88]  says he was amazed at the miracle.
[4091.88 --> 4093.44]  No, not the miracle.
[4093.44 --> 4096.92]  He was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
[4097.46 --> 4097.78]  Right?
[4097.86 --> 4098.70]  Really fascinating.
[4099.46 --> 4102.18]  He believed when he saw what happened to Elimus,
[4102.24 --> 4105.30]  but he was amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
[4106.38 --> 4106.58]  Right?
[4106.66 --> 4108.74]  Friends, God uses his word here.
[4109.36 --> 4111.28]  He wanted, you know, the proconsul,
[4111.34 --> 4112.90]  he wanted to hear the word of the Lord.
[4113.58 --> 4116.72]  And then when he saw the power of God at work
[4116.72 --> 4118.08]  confirming the word,
[4118.34 --> 4120.36]  and that just sealed in his heart
[4120.36 --> 4122.62]  this belief, and he comes to faith.
[4124.00 --> 4126.00]  You know, and Paul writes about this,
[4127.04 --> 4132.16]  the importance of the word of God in belief.
[4132.34 --> 4134.12]  And he writes about this in Romans 10.
[4134.58 --> 4135.70]  This is what Paul writes.
[4136.54 --> 4136.96]  He says,
[4136.96 --> 4139.72]  How then can they call on the one
[4139.72 --> 4141.62]  they have not believed in?
[4142.22 --> 4144.78]  And how can they believe in the one
[4144.78 --> 4146.18]  of whom they have not heard?
[4146.42 --> 4147.74]  And how can they hear
[4147.74 --> 4149.36]  without someone preaching to them?
[4150.04 --> 4151.48]  And how can anyone preach
[4151.48 --> 4152.68]  unless they are sent?
[4152.88 --> 4153.82]  As it is written,
[4154.30 --> 4155.58]  how beautiful are the feet
[4155.58 --> 4157.00]  of those who bring good news.
[4157.88 --> 4158.08]  Right?
[4158.16 --> 4159.20]  Paul and Barnabas
[4159.20 --> 4162.44]  are these beautiful feet
[4162.44 --> 4165.24]  that word God had sent out
[4165.24 --> 4167.24]  bearing the good news of God.
[4169.08 --> 4170.62]  And then it's from hearing
[4170.62 --> 4171.50]  the word of God
[4171.50 --> 4174.02]  that this proconsul
[4174.02 --> 4175.74]  and all of us believe.
[4175.90 --> 4176.70]  And in believing,
[4176.84 --> 4177.76]  we call out
[4177.76 --> 4179.68]  in the name of the Lord.
[4179.78 --> 4180.54]  We call out to him.
[4181.78 --> 4182.74]  And Jesus tells us
[4182.74 --> 4185.10]  in John chapter 3,
[4185.42 --> 4187.16]  he says that unless the spirit
[4187.16 --> 4189.96]  is at work to open our eyes,
[4190.08 --> 4191.20]  no one will be saved.
[4191.20 --> 4191.60]  Right?
[4192.34 --> 4193.28]  So faith in God
[4193.28 --> 4194.46]  is a work of the Holy Spirit.
[4194.94 --> 4195.92]  God must be at work
[4195.92 --> 4197.14]  to open people's eyes
[4197.14 --> 4198.38]  and bring them to see
[4198.38 --> 4199.32]  the light of the gospel.
[4199.74 --> 4200.92]  And that's what Paul says
[4200.92 --> 4202.40]  in 2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[4202.96 --> 4203.70]  He writes this,
[4203.74 --> 4204.54]  For God who said,
[4204.74 --> 4206.32]  let light shine out of darkness,
[4206.90 --> 4209.18]  made his light shine in our hearts
[4209.18 --> 4210.30]  to give us the light
[4210.30 --> 4211.70]  of the knowledge of God's glory
[4211.70 --> 4214.50]  displayed in the face of Christ.
[4215.56 --> 4215.90]  Right?
[4215.96 --> 4217.62]  So just like that miracle of creation
[4217.62 --> 4219.70]  where God made the world
[4219.70 --> 4222.04]  by speaking light into the world,
[4222.12 --> 4222.74]  into the darkness,
[4223.38 --> 4224.84]  in the same way, friends,
[4224.94 --> 4227.56]  God is the author of spiritual life.
[4227.98 --> 4229.38]  He takes what was dead
[4229.38 --> 4230.48]  and he makes it alive.
[4231.28 --> 4232.66]  He takes our blindness
[4232.66 --> 4234.44]  where we can't see Jesus
[4234.44 --> 4235.94]  and he opens our eyes
[4235.94 --> 4236.76]  so that spiritually
[4236.76 --> 4238.58]  we can then see Jesus.
[4239.30 --> 4241.46]  And he uses his word.
[4241.56 --> 4242.20]  He speaks.
[4242.36 --> 4243.04]  The word of God
[4243.04 --> 4244.34]  comes alive in our hearts
[4244.34 --> 4246.18]  that we might see Jesus clearly.
[4247.52 --> 4247.64]  Right?
[4247.86 --> 4248.30]  And friends,
[4248.38 --> 4249.10]  that tells us that
[4249.10 --> 4251.16]  our spiritual blindness,
[4251.42 --> 4252.14]  our sin,
[4252.68 --> 4254.28]  is not a barrier
[4254.28 --> 4255.54]  for the Holy Spirit.
[4256.76 --> 4257.02]  Right?
[4257.06 --> 4259.90]  Our sin is not so deep,
[4260.20 --> 4261.66]  so invasive in our hearts
[4261.66 --> 4262.48]  that the Holy Spirit
[4262.48 --> 4264.48]  cannot just break it apart
[4264.48 --> 4265.98]  and get to the core
[4265.98 --> 4268.26]  and renew us
[4268.26 --> 4269.22]  and give us life.
[4270.08 --> 4270.30]  Right?
[4270.30 --> 4272.26]  And neither can the schemes
[4272.26 --> 4273.04]  of the devil
[4273.04 --> 4275.02]  prevent God
[4275.02 --> 4276.78]  saving an individual.
[4279.68 --> 4280.90]  I love this quote
[4280.90 --> 4282.18]  by Charles Spurgeon.
[4283.36 --> 4285.26]  This is a famous Baptist preacher.
[4285.38 --> 4286.12]  This is what he writes.
[4287.50 --> 4287.90]  He said,
[4288.02 --> 4288.42]  The Lord,
[4288.56 --> 4290.16]  when he means to save sinners,
[4290.78 --> 4292.04]  does not stop to ask them
[4292.04 --> 4293.64]  whether they mean to be saved,
[4294.14 --> 4296.40]  but like a rushing mighty wind,
[4296.60 --> 4297.94]  the divine influence
[4297.94 --> 4300.06]  sweeps away every obstacle.
[4301.06 --> 4302.54]  The unwilling heart
[4302.54 --> 4303.64]  bends before
[4303.64 --> 4305.42]  the potent gale of grace,
[4306.22 --> 4306.80]  and sinners
[4306.80 --> 4308.20]  that would not yield
[4308.20 --> 4310.48]  are made to yield
[4310.48 --> 4311.50]  by God.
[4315.82 --> 4317.58]  So what we see here, friends,
[4317.70 --> 4318.68]  in Acts 13
[4318.68 --> 4320.02]  is that wherever
[4320.02 --> 4321.54]  the gospel is preached,
[4322.16 --> 4323.38]  some people respond
[4323.38 --> 4324.16]  in unbelief,
[4324.90 --> 4326.16]  sometimes even opposing
[4326.16 --> 4326.74]  the gospel
[4326.74 --> 4328.74]  because of their
[4328.74 --> 4329.46]  spiritual blindness.
[4329.46 --> 4330.86]  but some people
[4330.86 --> 4331.84]  respond in faith.
[4332.64 --> 4333.68]  And for those who believe,
[4333.76 --> 4334.62]  it's not because of anything
[4334.62 --> 4335.34]  in them,
[4335.70 --> 4336.96]  but because the Holy Spirit
[4336.96 --> 4338.48]  takes the word of God
[4338.48 --> 4339.72]  and uses it
[4339.72 --> 4341.30]  to open our eyes
[4341.30 --> 4342.02]  to see Jesus,
[4342.18 --> 4342.94]  enabling us
[4342.94 --> 4343.84]  to put our faith in him.
[4344.66 --> 4345.12]  And friends,
[4345.22 --> 4346.16]  why does all this happen?
[4347.96 --> 4348.92]  This happens
[4348.92 --> 4350.36]  because Jesus is alive.
[4351.20 --> 4351.32]  Right?
[4351.42 --> 4352.16]  Jesus came
[4352.16 --> 4353.48]  to bring us to God.
[4353.60 --> 4354.32]  Jesus came
[4354.32 --> 4356.44]  to reveal God to us.
[4356.44 --> 4357.92]  He came to save us
[4357.92 --> 4359.02]  from our spiritual blindness.
[4359.48 --> 4361.16]  He came to make us
[4361.16 --> 4363.36]  true bar Jesuses.
[4364.36 --> 4364.60]  Right?
[4364.90 --> 4366.56]  True sons of salvation.
[4367.54 --> 4368.54]  And then the risen Christ
[4368.54 --> 4369.34]  is the one who says
[4369.34 --> 4370.14]  to each one of us,
[4370.56 --> 4370.90]  go,
[4371.58 --> 4373.40]  be these beautiful feet.
[4374.34 --> 4375.50]  You will be my witnesses
[4375.50 --> 4376.72]  to the ends of the earth
[4376.72 --> 4380.50]  because the grand cathedral vision,
[4380.94 --> 4382.00]  the vision of God,
[4382.10 --> 4383.22]  is that his love
[4383.22 --> 4384.62]  would reach the whole world.
[4384.62 --> 4386.20]  And he says,
[4386.60 --> 4387.64]  I am giving you my spirit
[4387.64 --> 4388.30]  to be with you.
[4388.46 --> 4389.62]  I am empowering you.
[4389.74 --> 4390.66]  I am going with you.
[4391.78 --> 4392.10]  And friends,
[4392.14 --> 4392.40]  so I just,
[4392.50 --> 4393.36]  I want to encourage us
[4393.36 --> 4393.80]  this morning.
[4395.28 --> 4396.98]  We serve a living God.
[4397.12 --> 4397.86]  We serve a God
[4397.86 --> 4399.12]  who is active
[4399.12 --> 4399.78]  in this world
[4399.78 --> 4400.48]  even today.
[4401.50 --> 4402.90]  And the book of Acts
[4402.90 --> 4403.80]  is here to show us
[4403.80 --> 4404.88]  how this church began.
[4405.42 --> 4406.94]  And where we are here now
[4406.94 --> 4409.34]  because of this first
[4409.34 --> 4410.38]  missionary journey
[4410.38 --> 4410.92]  that happened.
[4411.36 --> 4411.60]  Friends,
[4411.66 --> 4412.42]  if this didn't happen,
[4412.52 --> 4413.38]  if Paul and Barnabas
[4413.38 --> 4413.64]  were like,
[4413.64 --> 4414.24]  we're just going to stay
[4414.24 --> 4414.94]  in Antioch,
[4414.98 --> 4415.08]  you know,
[4415.10 --> 4415.64]  there's a lot of work
[4415.64 --> 4416.32]  to be done here.
[4416.66 --> 4417.70]  We shouldn't stretch ourselves.
[4417.98 --> 4419.50]  We shouldn't take five elders
[4419.50 --> 4421.46]  and get rid of two of them already
[4421.46 --> 4422.76]  when there's so much work
[4422.76 --> 4423.50]  that needs to be done.
[4423.82 --> 4424.02]  Friends,
[4424.08 --> 4425.02]  if they didn't follow
[4425.02 --> 4426.86]  the sending of the Holy Spirit,
[4427.92 --> 4429.06]  perhaps we wouldn't be here
[4429.06 --> 4429.50]  this morning.
[4431.06 --> 4432.84]  But this story continues
[4432.84 --> 4434.96]  because God is alive.
[4435.40 --> 4436.88]  And we are to follow God,
[4436.96 --> 4437.76]  we are to live for him,
[4437.80 --> 4439.02]  and we are to be faithful to him,
[4439.44 --> 4441.12]  expecting him to continue
[4441.12 --> 4442.14]  to work through his church.
[4442.72 --> 4442.96]  Friends,
[4443.02 --> 4444.52]  to continue to work through us.
[4445.58 --> 4445.76]  You know,
[4445.84 --> 4446.90]  someone had once
[4446.90 --> 4449.24]  had a generous encounter with us
[4449.24 --> 4450.84]  and told us about Jesus.
[4451.84 --> 4453.22]  And so we want to be generous
[4453.22 --> 4454.40]  in our turn
[4454.40 --> 4456.08]  and pass on the light.
[4456.98 --> 4457.20]  Right?
[4457.22 --> 4458.30]  We don't want to hide the light
[4458.30 --> 4459.50]  on 54 A Street
[4459.50 --> 4461.22]  where our church building is
[4461.22 --> 4462.60]  because we want everyone
[4462.60 --> 4463.90]  to know the love
[4463.90 --> 4464.70]  and grace of Jesus
[4464.70 --> 4465.72]  just as we have.
[4466.70 --> 4468.00]  And so I want to encourage us
[4468.00 --> 4469.90]  to simply be faithful
[4469.90 --> 4470.74]  to our mission,
[4471.30 --> 4472.94]  to seek and to see people
[4472.94 --> 4473.90]  come to know Jesus.
[4474.68 --> 4475.74]  We can do that, friends,
[4475.82 --> 4477.18]  by praying,
[4478.32 --> 4479.58]  praying for people we know
[4479.58 --> 4480.80]  to come to faith in Jesus.
[4481.32 --> 4482.38]  We need to pray for people.
[4483.00 --> 4485.00]  We can invite them to church.
[4485.52 --> 4485.64]  Right?
[4485.68 --> 4486.44]  We can say,
[4486.52 --> 4487.14]  come along,
[4487.64 --> 4488.82]  hear the word of the Lord.
[4489.44 --> 4490.48]  And we can be open
[4490.48 --> 4491.86]  to how God might use us
[4491.86 --> 4493.18]  and give us opportunities
[4493.18 --> 4494.82]  to tell people about Jesus.
[4494.82 --> 4495.90]  But it takes an openness.
[4496.50 --> 4497.68]  It takes an awareness,
[4497.86 --> 4498.44]  a prayerfulness
[4498.44 --> 4499.64]  of what God is doing
[4499.64 --> 4500.16]  in our lives
[4500.16 --> 4501.14]  and what he wants to do.
[4501.78 --> 4502.24]  So, friends,
[4502.34 --> 4503.64]  can we open our hearts
[4503.64 --> 4505.12]  to God?
[4505.38 --> 4506.56]  And can we ask him
[4506.56 --> 4508.52]  to be at work in us
[4508.52 --> 4509.98]  and to use us?
[4511.00 --> 4511.76]  Okay, let's pray.
[4512.32 --> 4513.14]  Let's ask the Holy Spirit
[4513.14 --> 4513.80]  to help us.
[4516.30 --> 4518.10]  Lord, it is you who we serve.
[4518.70 --> 4520.34]  It is you who has saved us.
[4520.92 --> 4522.46]  It is you who left heaven
[4522.46 --> 4523.32]  for earth,
[4523.90 --> 4525.20]  left the comforts of home,
[4525.92 --> 4527.42]  and who was sent out
[4527.42 --> 4528.14]  by the Father
[4528.14 --> 4529.06]  on a mission
[4529.06 --> 4530.40]  to seek and save the lost.
[4531.28 --> 4531.74]  And Lord,
[4531.80 --> 4533.24]  would you work in our hearts
[4533.24 --> 4534.82]  to make us open
[4534.82 --> 4536.72]  to how we can join you
[4536.72 --> 4537.28]  in that mission.
[4538.36 --> 4539.76]  Give us your heart, Lord,
[4539.80 --> 4540.32]  for the world.
[4541.16 --> 4542.10]  Give us your grace.
[4543.44 --> 4544.50]  Give us your spirit
[4544.50 --> 4545.44]  to empower us.
[4546.44 --> 4547.34]  Give us courage.
[4547.34 --> 4548.90]  And God,
[4548.98 --> 4550.06]  we give you our lives
[4550.06 --> 4551.80]  and we give you our church.
[4552.20 --> 4553.26]  Would you make your name
[4553.26 --> 4554.36]  known to this world
[4554.36 --> 4555.40]  through us,
[4555.70 --> 4556.26]  your servants.
[4556.38 --> 4557.70]  And we pray in Jesus' name.
[4558.14 --> 4558.46]  Amen.
[4560.28 --> 4560.84]  All right,
[4560.94 --> 4561.72]  let's stand
[4561.72 --> 4562.58]  and let's sing
[4562.58 --> 4563.64]  our song of response together.
[4563.64 --> 4563.74]  together.
[4579.74 --> 4583.86]  Lift high the name of Jesus,
[4584.24 --> 4587.28]  of Jesus our King.
[4587.80 --> 4591.50]  Ignore the power of his grace,
[4591.50 --> 4594.62]  the beauty of his peace.
[4595.10 --> 4598.92]  Remember how his mercy reached,
[4599.22 --> 4602.02]  and we cried out to him.
[4602.72 --> 4606.36]  He lifted us to solid ground,
[4606.46 --> 4609.66]  to freedom from our sin.
[4610.14 --> 4613.28]  Oh, sing my song,
[4613.74 --> 4616.82]  and tell all he's done,
[4616.82 --> 4619.12]  till the earth and heavens
[4619.12 --> 4621.84]  are filled with his glory.
[4628.24 --> 4631.88]  Lift high the name of Jesus,
[4632.26 --> 4635.30]  of Jesus our Lord.
[4635.80 --> 4639.28]  His power in us is greater than,
[4639.44 --> 4642.52]  is greater than this world.
[4642.52 --> 4646.66]  To share the reason for our hope,
[4646.66 --> 4649.94]  to serve with love and grace,
[4649.94 --> 4654.02]  that all who see him shine through us,
[4654.14 --> 4657.40]  might bring the Father praise.
[4657.88 --> 4661.02]  Oh, sing my song,
[4661.44 --> 4664.68]  and tell all he's done,
[4664.96 --> 4667.02]  till the earth and heavens
[4667.02 --> 4669.54]  are filled with his glory.
[4669.54 --> 4680.14]  lift high the name of Jesus,
[4680.14 --> 4683.14]  of Jesus our light.
[4683.94 --> 4687.80]  No other name on earth can sing,
[4687.88 --> 4691.12]  can raise us to life.
[4691.54 --> 4695.32]  He opens up our eyes to see,
[4695.32 --> 4698.60]  the harvest he has grown,
[4698.60 --> 4698.66]  the harvest he has grown.
[4698.66 --> 4702.92]  We labor in his fields of grace,
[4702.92 --> 4706.26]  as he leads sinners home.
[4706.78 --> 4709.98]  Oh, sing my song,
[4710.38 --> 4713.66]  and tell all he's done,
[4714.10 --> 4716.12]  till the earth and heavens
[4716.12 --> 4718.92]  are filled with his glory.
[4718.92 --> 4732.84]  All right, so we come now to the time
[4732.84 --> 4734.76]  where we worship the Lord
[4734.76 --> 4736.54]  by the giving of our tithes
[4736.54 --> 4737.18]  and our offerings.
[4737.40 --> 4738.98]  And so each week,
[4738.98 --> 4742.06]  we give to our church
[4742.06 --> 4743.92]  for our own ministry needs.
[4744.48 --> 4745.56]  And also we each week
[4745.56 --> 4747.22]  have a designated offering
[4747.22 --> 4749.56]  where we seek to partner
[4749.56 --> 4750.52]  with other organizations
[4750.52 --> 4751.40]  to be on mission
[4751.40 --> 4752.56]  where we are
[4752.56 --> 4753.40]  and also in the world.
[4753.52 --> 4755.34]  And so our designated offering
[4755.34 --> 4755.92]  for today
[4755.92 --> 4757.28]  is the Vancouver Short-Term
[4757.28 --> 4758.26]  Mission Training Center.
[4758.60 --> 4759.56]  And actually, Pastor Nancy,
[4759.72 --> 4760.74]  as I've mentioned in the past,
[4761.14 --> 4762.58]  she has been through
[4762.58 --> 4763.60]  a lot of their programs
[4763.60 --> 4765.78]  where they're training people
[4765.78 --> 4766.48]  in evangelism.
[4766.58 --> 4767.68]  Sometimes we need to be equipped
[4767.68 --> 4768.94]  to share the gospel.
[4769.54 --> 4770.24]  And I know as like
[4770.24 --> 4772.18]  the Richmond Night Market opens up,
[4772.22 --> 4773.04]  a lot of their people
[4773.04 --> 4775.14]  have a booth in the night market
[4775.14 --> 4776.22]  where people come by
[4776.22 --> 4777.06]  and they just share
[4777.06 --> 4777.86]  the gospel with them.
[4778.18 --> 4778.84]  And a lot of people
[4778.84 --> 4779.42]  come to faith
[4779.42 --> 4780.36]  every summer through that.
[4781.10 --> 4781.84]  And so that's a bit
[4781.84 --> 4782.92]  about what they do.
[4783.76 --> 4785.62]  So may I invite the deacons
[4785.62 --> 4787.46]  to collect the morning offering.
[4787.46 --> 4804.04]  Good shepherd of my soul,
[4804.04 --> 4807.72]  come dwell within me.
[4808.08 --> 4811.74]  Take all I am and hold
[4811.74 --> 4815.14]  your likeness in me.
[4815.14 --> 4818.98]  Before the cross of Christ,
[4819.18 --> 4822.70]  this is my sacrifice,
[4823.28 --> 4825.12]  a life laid down
[4825.12 --> 4827.24]  and ready to follow.
[4827.24 --> 4838.50]  The troubled find their peace
[4838.50 --> 4840.88]  in true surrender.
[4840.88 --> 4845.56]  The prisoners they release
[4845.56 --> 4848.40]  from chains of anger.
[4849.40 --> 4853.08]  In springs of living grace,
[4853.08 --> 4856.86]  I find a resting place
[4856.86 --> 4859.38]  to rise refreshed,
[4859.38 --> 4861.56]  determined to follow.
[4867.70 --> 4872.38]  I'll walk this narrow road
[4872.38 --> 4875.72]  with Christ before me,
[4875.72 --> 4880.06]  where thorns and thistles grow
[4880.06 --> 4883.92]  and thorns ensnare me.
[4883.92 --> 4887.66]  Though doubted and denied,
[4888.28 --> 4891.64]  He never leaves my side,
[4892.18 --> 4894.04]  but lifts my head
[4894.04 --> 4895.98]  and calls me to follow.
[4895.98 --> 4906.44]  And when my days are gone,
[4906.44 --> 4909.10]  my strength is failing.
[4910.44 --> 4913.64]  He'll marry me alone
[4913.64 --> 4917.28]  through death's unveiling.
[4917.90 --> 4920.44]  Her struggles overcome,
[4921.72 --> 4924.96]  heaven's journey just begun.
[4924.96 --> 4927.52]  To search Christ's depths
[4927.52 --> 4929.82]  and ever to follow.
[4931.44 --> 4934.12]  To search Christ's depths
[4934.12 --> 4937.12]  and ever to follow.
[4948.12 --> 4949.42]  Let's bow our heads
[4949.42 --> 4950.56]  and pray together.
[4950.82 --> 4952.46]  And this is our pastoral prayer,
[4952.64 --> 4953.32]  community prayer,
[4953.32 --> 4955.14]  where we pray for particularly
[4955.14 --> 4957.22]  the needs of our own church community
[4957.22 --> 4958.96]  and also the world.
[4959.08 --> 4959.54]  So let's pray.
[4961.60 --> 4962.96]  Our Lord God Almighty,
[4963.84 --> 4965.46]  creator of all things,
[4966.32 --> 4967.38]  Lord of salvation,
[4968.80 --> 4969.90]  head of your church,
[4970.14 --> 4971.08]  shepherd of your people,
[4972.44 --> 4975.00]  Lord, we bow before you this morning.
[4975.72 --> 4977.00]  We approach you,
[4977.38 --> 4978.82]  we approach the throne of grace,
[4979.58 --> 4981.06]  seeking help and mercy
[4981.06 --> 4982.02]  in our time of need.
[4983.70 --> 4987.02]  Lord, we have many needs
[4987.02 --> 4989.08]  that we lift up before you
[4989.08 --> 4990.74]  and some things also to celebrate.
[4990.92 --> 4992.30]  Lord, we especially celebrate
[4992.30 --> 4993.96]  with Kimberly Verbeek
[4993.96 --> 4995.64]  and Brendan Bolin,
[4996.00 --> 4997.64]  who were married just yesterday
[4997.64 --> 4998.40]  in our church.
[4999.10 --> 5000.72]  And as Kimberly and Brendan,
[5001.22 --> 5002.70]  Lord, begin a life together,
[5003.46 --> 5003.98]  a marriage,
[5004.08 --> 5005.08]  Lord, would you be
[5005.08 --> 5006.58]  at the center
[5006.58 --> 5008.50]  of that marriage?
[5009.28 --> 5009.92]  And Lord,
[5010.46 --> 5011.36]  because marriage
[5011.36 --> 5012.76]  is a joy,
[5013.10 --> 5014.48]  but also because of two sinners
[5014.48 --> 5015.44]  being brought together,
[5015.60 --> 5016.54]  it is a challenge.
[5017.00 --> 5017.60]  Would you
[5017.60 --> 5018.90]  shower them
[5018.90 --> 5019.56]  with your grace?
[5020.38 --> 5021.00]  Would you
[5021.00 --> 5021.82]  help them,
[5021.98 --> 5022.14]  Lord,
[5022.96 --> 5023.60]  to walk
[5023.60 --> 5025.12]  down this path
[5025.12 --> 5025.64]  of marriage,
[5025.72 --> 5026.34]  to love
[5026.34 --> 5028.30]  and serve one another,
[5028.46 --> 5028.56]  Lord,
[5028.60 --> 5029.72]  for your ultimate glory?
[5029.72 --> 5031.94]  And Lord,
[5032.10 --> 5033.52]  we also this morning
[5033.52 --> 5034.80]  come not only with joy,
[5035.00 --> 5036.58]  but in grief.
[5038.04 --> 5038.68]  And Lord,
[5038.82 --> 5039.84]  would you be near
[5039.84 --> 5041.22]  to our dear sister Pat
[5041.22 --> 5042.28]  and her family
[5042.28 --> 5043.58]  as we mourn
[5043.58 --> 5044.42]  the recent passing
[5044.42 --> 5045.56]  of Peter into glory?
[5046.36 --> 5046.66]  But Lord,
[5046.76 --> 5048.10]  just as we just sang,
[5049.48 --> 5049.70]  Lord,
[5049.92 --> 5050.88]  death's unveiling
[5050.88 --> 5052.62]  leads us
[5052.62 --> 5054.52]  onto the beginning
[5054.52 --> 5055.32]  of a journey
[5055.32 --> 5057.98]  of seeing Jesus
[5057.98 --> 5058.82]  face to face,
[5058.82 --> 5060.58]  and Lord,
[5060.68 --> 5062.60]  of being
[5062.60 --> 5063.78]  in the joy
[5063.78 --> 5064.54]  of his presence
[5064.54 --> 5065.60]  and growing
[5065.60 --> 5066.84]  in our knowledge
[5066.84 --> 5068.02]  of his love for us.
[5068.52 --> 5069.34]  We thank you,
[5069.50 --> 5069.66]  Lord,
[5070.16 --> 5070.94]  though that
[5070.94 --> 5072.68]  when we grieve
[5072.68 --> 5073.60]  and as we grieve
[5073.60 --> 5074.72]  that you are near
[5074.72 --> 5076.30]  to the brokenhearted.
[5076.98 --> 5077.06]  Lord,
[5077.10 --> 5078.02]  we continue also
[5078.02 --> 5079.20]  to pray for
[5079.20 --> 5080.20]  Shirley
[5080.20 --> 5081.68]  and their family
[5081.68 --> 5082.70]  with the passing
[5082.70 --> 5083.70]  of Shirley's sister.
[5085.36 --> 5085.62]  Lord,
[5085.68 --> 5086.26]  there are also
[5086.26 --> 5087.56]  other concerns
[5087.56 --> 5088.26]  in our congregation.
[5088.26 --> 5089.04]  we lift up
[5089.04 --> 5089.54]  this morning
[5089.54 --> 5090.00]  to you
[5090.00 --> 5090.92]  Amy Cron,
[5091.60 --> 5091.94]  Lord,
[5091.98 --> 5092.42]  who is back
[5092.42 --> 5093.08]  in the hospital.
[5094.04 --> 5094.32]  Lord,
[5094.38 --> 5095.42]  we ask for
[5095.42 --> 5096.00]  your healing
[5096.00 --> 5097.04]  hand upon her.
[5097.94 --> 5098.18]  Lord,
[5098.22 --> 5099.06]  would you comfort
[5099.06 --> 5100.20]  her family?
[5100.76 --> 5101.00]  And Lord,
[5101.04 --> 5101.62]  would you bring
[5101.62 --> 5102.44]  healing as you
[5102.44 --> 5102.90]  are able?
[5104.12 --> 5104.48]  And Lord,
[5104.54 --> 5105.22]  we also lift up
[5105.22 --> 5105.66]  Aubrey,
[5105.76 --> 5106.26]  little Aubrey
[5106.26 --> 5107.12]  Burren to you
[5107.12 --> 5107.80]  who was
[5107.80 --> 5109.64]  back in the hospital
[5109.64 --> 5110.28]  last night.
[5110.28 --> 5111.14]  Lord,
[5111.22 --> 5112.26]  be with Emmanuel
[5112.26 --> 5112.90]  and Sifahe.
[5114.06 --> 5116.44]  And Lord,
[5116.52 --> 5117.22]  in this trial,
[5117.50 --> 5117.66]  Lord,
[5117.90 --> 5119.00]  give insight
[5119.00 --> 5119.66]  to the doctors
[5119.66 --> 5120.18]  who know
[5120.18 --> 5121.70]  what is wrong
[5121.70 --> 5123.04]  and what can be done.
[5123.28 --> 5123.40]  Lord,
[5123.56 --> 5124.28]  but ultimately,
[5124.50 --> 5124.60]  Lord,
[5124.66 --> 5125.44]  you are the healer.
[5125.82 --> 5126.10]  And Lord,
[5126.18 --> 5127.98]  we cast our cares
[5127.98 --> 5128.56]  upon you
[5128.56 --> 5129.24]  and lift Aubrey
[5129.24 --> 5129.84]  up to you.
[5131.62 --> 5131.94]  Lord,
[5132.00 --> 5132.56]  we also come
[5132.56 --> 5133.42]  to you asking
[5133.42 --> 5134.50]  again for your grace
[5134.50 --> 5135.16]  upon our newly
[5135.16 --> 5135.94]  installed elders.
[5135.94 --> 5137.38]  and Lord,
[5137.44 --> 5138.76]  we lift up to you
[5138.76 --> 5140.38]  them also,
[5140.78 --> 5141.36]  those who have been
[5141.36 --> 5142.52]  serving and our deacons
[5142.52 --> 5142.96]  as well.
[5143.86 --> 5144.06]  Lord,
[5144.12 --> 5145.30]  we need you
[5145.30 --> 5145.90]  to be at work.
[5145.98 --> 5146.48]  Who are we,
[5146.62 --> 5146.74]  Lord,
[5146.78 --> 5147.54]  but weak vessels?
[5148.90 --> 5149.54]  So Lord,
[5149.58 --> 5150.42]  would you empower
[5150.42 --> 5152.00]  those who serve
[5152.00 --> 5152.64]  us,
[5153.54 --> 5153.78]  Lord,
[5153.88 --> 5154.62]  instruct them
[5154.62 --> 5155.92]  with your grace,
[5156.06 --> 5156.62]  your truth,
[5156.74 --> 5157.24]  your wisdom
[5157.24 --> 5159.80]  that they might lead us
[5159.80 --> 5161.84]  in care for this congregation
[5161.84 --> 5163.62]  according to your ways,
[5163.74 --> 5163.86]  Lord.
[5164.50 --> 5164.88]  Lord,
[5164.94 --> 5165.68]  we pray for the
[5165.68 --> 5166.58]  Vancouver Short Term
[5166.58 --> 5167.50]  Mission Training Center.
[5168.34 --> 5170.00]  We pray for all
[5170.00 --> 5171.06]  of their evangelistic
[5171.06 --> 5173.44]  activities in Vancouver,
[5173.68 --> 5174.34]  Metro Vancouver.
[5175.42 --> 5175.76]  And Lord,
[5175.82 --> 5177.28]  we pray for the harvest.
[5177.44 --> 5178.50]  We pray for many people
[5178.50 --> 5179.88]  to hear the good news
[5179.88 --> 5180.68]  of Jesus Christ
[5180.68 --> 5182.44]  and to come to faith
[5182.44 --> 5183.08]  and get plugged
[5183.08 --> 5183.84]  into a church.
[5185.18 --> 5185.60]  And Lord,
[5185.88 --> 5187.12]  these and so many
[5187.12 --> 5187.80]  other things
[5187.80 --> 5188.36]  that are laying
[5188.36 --> 5189.38]  on our hearts,
[5189.66 --> 5190.32]  each one of us
[5190.32 --> 5190.98]  here this morning,
[5191.44 --> 5191.60]  Lord,
[5191.66 --> 5192.48]  we bring to you
[5192.48 --> 5193.72]  and we do so
[5193.72 --> 5194.68]  knowing that our
[5194.68 --> 5195.30]  Lord Jesus
[5195.30 --> 5196.68]  intercedes for us
[5196.68 --> 5198.30]  and the Holy Spirit
[5198.30 --> 5200.68]  also,
[5201.18 --> 5201.76]  Lord,
[5201.88 --> 5202.60]  brings our prayers
[5202.60 --> 5203.40]  before the Father.
[5203.66 --> 5203.94]  And so,
[5204.08 --> 5204.16]  Lord,
[5204.20 --> 5204.64]  we do that
[5204.64 --> 5205.24]  with confidence
[5205.24 --> 5206.38]  and hope.
[5206.80 --> 5208.06]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[5208.78 --> 5209.10]  Amen.
[5210.88 --> 5211.66]  Okay, friends,
[5211.74 --> 5212.78]  we will go out now
[5212.78 --> 5213.98]  with God's good word,
[5214.12 --> 5214.76]  his benediction
[5214.76 --> 5215.84]  over us
[5215.84 --> 5217.48]  and I invite you
[5217.48 --> 5217.98]  to join us
[5217.98 --> 5219.12]  for a time of coffee
[5219.12 --> 5219.64]  and fellowship
[5219.64 --> 5221.32]  in the fellowship hall,
[5221.42 --> 5221.92]  which is right through
[5221.92 --> 5222.50]  the doors there.
[5222.50 --> 5223.84]  and now I invite you
[5223.84 --> 5224.94]  to hold out your hands
[5224.94 --> 5225.80]  as a gesture
[5225.80 --> 5227.06]  of receiving God's blessing.
[5228.26 --> 5229.52]  The Lord bless you
[5229.52 --> 5230.50]  and keep you.
[5231.16 --> 5231.90]  The Lord lift up
[5231.90 --> 5232.86]  his face upon you
[5232.86 --> 5233.92]  and be gracious to you.
[5234.66 --> 5235.66]  The Lord lift up
[5235.66 --> 5236.84]  his countenance upon you
[5236.84 --> 5238.30]  and give you peace.
[5238.76 --> 5239.00]  Amen.
[5239.28 --> 5240.20]  Please remain standing
[5240.20 --> 5240.92]  and we'll sing
[5240.92 --> 5242.06]  the doxology
[5242.06 --> 5243.54]  as we go out from here.
[5243.54 --> 5256.66]  Praise God from you
[5256.66 --> 5260.82]  All blessings flow
[5260.82 --> 5266.02]  Praise him, all creatures
[5266.02 --> 5269.38]  here below
[5269.38 --> 5273.72]  Praise him above
[5273.72 --> 5278.84]  the heavenly host
[5278.84 --> 5283.20]  Praise Father, Son
[5283.20 --> 5287.98]  and Holy Ghost
[5287.98 --> 5291.16]  Amen
[5291.16 --> 5296.34]  Amen
[5296.34 --> 5302.10]  Amen

[5315.68 --> 5316.60]  Amen
[5316.60 --> 5316.84]  Amen
[5316.84 --> 5318.40]  Amen
[5318.40 --> 5320.94]  Amen
[5320.94 --> 5324.58]  Amen
[5324.58 --> 5326.20]  Amen
[5326.20 --> 5350.02]  And I'll catch you later.
