[285.86 --> 291.86]  And a special welcome to anyone who is worshiping here with us for maybe the first few times.
[291.86 --> 297.86]  And I know there's some guests and family friends of Lorna and Kenny who are here for the baptism.
[297.86 --> 299.86]  So welcome.
[299.86 --> 307.86]  And I hope that you all stick around after the service for a time of fellowship so that we can get to know you better.
[307.86 --> 311.86]  So next Sunday is December 24th.

[316.86 --> 323.86]  But then come back that evening because we will be having our Christmas Eve evening worship service.
[323.86 --> 326.86]  And also there are some invitation cards.

[328.86 --> 336.86]  And so those are for you to give to neighbors, friends, family to invite them to our Christmas services.
[336.86 --> 339.86]  Well, we are in the season of Advent.
[339.86 --> 344.86]  And one of the ways we mark this season is by the lighting of our Advent candle.
[344.86 --> 352.86]  There are five candles, four representing the four weeks before Christmas,
[352.86 --> 359.86]  and then the middle candle which we light on Christmas Day, signifying that Christ has come.
[359.86 --> 366.86]  And so we will invite Edgar, Suzanne, and their girls, Serena and Sylvia,
[366.86 --> 371.86]  to lead us in the call to worship and the Advent lighting.
[371.86 --> 374.86]  Thank you.

[377.86 --> 379.86]  Thank you.
[379.86 --> 385.86]  In this season of Advent, we pray, O come, O come, Emmanuel.

[1903.36 --> 1911.06]  Have the rain, my enemies, and all who wish us all.
[1912.80 --> 1922.10]  With promise mercy will God steal, the covenant recall.
[1922.10 --> 1933.10]  The oath once more to Abraham, from those to save us all.
[1933.88 --> 1943.80]  That we would worship without fear, and offer lives of praise.
[1943.80 --> 1954.66]  In holiness and righteousness, to serve God all our days.
[1954.66 --> 1965.98]  My child as prophet of God, you will prepare the way.
[1965.98 --> 1975.98]  To tell God's people they are saved, from sin's eternal sway.
[1975.98 --> 1987.80]  The lips shall as mercy from on God, shine forth and never cease.
[1987.80 --> 1998.80]  To drive away the blue mountain, and lead us into peace.
[1998.80 --> 2011.32]  To drive away the blue mountain, and lead us into peace.
[2011.32 --> 2016.44]  All right, so the children are now dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[2016.44 --> 2034.52]  All right, so good morning again.
[2034.52 --> 2039.72]  We, as I mentioned, are in the church season of Advent.
[2040.66 --> 2044.72]  The season of Advent is the season, it's a season of waiting.
[2045.22 --> 2050.74]  It's a season of reflecting on the coming of Jesus into our world to redeem us.
[2050.74 --> 2056.02]  As Christians, we are waiting for the second coming.
[2056.02 --> 2062.52]  We're waiting for the full and final redemption of the world in the new heavens and the new earth
[2062.52 --> 2067.50]  that Jesus will bring to completion when he returns, when he comes again.
[2067.50 --> 2075.32]  But how are we to wait and reflect on the future return of Christ?
[2076.04 --> 2082.54]  Well, one way that we do that is by putting ourselves into the shoes or into the story
[2082.54 --> 2087.40]  of how God's people waited for Jesus to come the first time.
[2088.22 --> 2093.12]  Right, which is what we celebrate at Christmas, when Jesus came as the long-awaited Messiah
[2093.12 --> 2096.36]  to redeem us through his life, death, and resurrection.
[2097.50 --> 2102.60]  And so the way we're going to be reflecting on this first coming of Christ at Christmas this year
[2102.60 --> 2106.18]  is by looking to the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah,
[2106.48 --> 2112.04]  and particularly these different names or titles for the Messiah.
[2112.90 --> 2116.72]  And those, there are seven of them, and we have them here that Emmanuel did for us.
[2116.72 --> 2126.68]  So Wisdom, Lord, Root of Jesse, Key of David, Dayspring, King of Nations, and God with us, Emmanuel.
[2127.50 --> 2133.80]  And these messianic titles form the basis of the different verses in the song,
[2134.28 --> 2136.12]  O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.
[2136.82 --> 2140.88]  In musical terms, these verses are called antiphons,
[2141.28 --> 2145.16]  which simply means that they are prayers that are sung.
[2145.60 --> 2147.06]  Right, we sing lots of different songs.
[2147.14 --> 2149.10]  Not all of them are formed as prayers.
[2149.10 --> 2150.72]  But this song is.
[2151.48 --> 2154.44]  It begins with, O, wisdom.
[2154.76 --> 2160.42]  Right, we're calling out to God, and then we ask Jesus to come to us in one of these particular ways.
[2160.50 --> 2162.68]  So it's a song that is a prayer.
[2163.70 --> 2166.28]  And so when we sing, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,
[2166.62 --> 2169.72]  we're actually singing out our prayers to God.
[2169.72 --> 2174.48]  Asking Jesus to come, again, in all these ways that we need him to come.
[2174.94 --> 2179.70]  We need him to come and bring redemption to our lives and to this world.
[2180.82 --> 2185.84]  So the title for Jesus that we come to today is Key of David.
[2186.80 --> 2192.14]  And so we, and we find that title in Isaiah chapter 22, verse 22.
[2192.14 --> 2198.40]  But so we can see the larger context, we'll read verses 20 to 25 in your bulletin.
[2198.48 --> 2203.68]  I think I had earlier, started earlier, but I decided to tighten it up.
[2203.78 --> 2206.16]  So we'll read actually just verses 20 to 25.
[2206.40 --> 2209.06]  Please open your Bibles and follow along with me.
[2210.56 --> 2215.48]  Isaiah chapter 22, verses 20 to 25.
[2215.72 --> 2217.54]  So beginning in verse 20.
[2217.54 --> 2224.44]  In that day, I will summon my servant, Eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
[2225.08 --> 2231.36]  I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him.
[2231.46 --> 2236.18]  He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah.
[2237.12 --> 2240.50]  I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David.
[2240.76 --> 2241.34]  There it is.
[2242.22 --> 2243.30]  Key to the house of David.
[2243.78 --> 2245.56]  What he opens, no one can shut.
[2245.56 --> 2248.16]  What he shuts, no one can open.
[2248.88 --> 2251.70]  I will drive him like a peg into a firm place.
[2252.36 --> 2256.38]  He will become a seat of honor for the house of his father.
[2257.26 --> 2259.92]  All the glory of his family will hang on him.
[2260.50 --> 2265.40]  Its offspring and offshoots, all of its lesser vessels, from the bulls to all the jars.
[2265.96 --> 2272.24]  And that day, declares the Lord Almighty, the peg driven into the firm place will give way.
[2272.24 --> 2274.90]  It will be sheared off and will fall.
[2275.22 --> 2278.82]  And the load hanging on it will be cut down.
[2279.24 --> 2280.92]  The Lord has spoken.
[2282.10 --> 2283.44]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2286.44 --> 2288.86]  Let's pray together as we come before God's word.
[2289.34 --> 2291.46]  Father, again, we come before you this morning.
[2291.46 --> 2293.70]  And we thank you for your word.
[2294.50 --> 2298.44]  We thank you, Lord, that your word is true and that it is given to us in love.
[2299.20 --> 2308.56]  And so, Lord, by the work, the power, and the presence of your Holy Spirit, would you illumine our hearts, our minds, our strength,
[2308.56 --> 2316.36]  that we might know you more and await the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the key of David.
[2317.52 --> 2320.24]  Lord, help us now, your people.
[2320.42 --> 2321.48]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2321.72 --> 2321.96]  Amen.
[2323.18 --> 2330.90]  So, as I was thinking about this theme of the key of David, it led me to think of this scene in the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean.
[2331.76 --> 2335.64]  Who has seen Pirates of the Caribbean, or ridden the ride, right?
[2337.06 --> 2342.42]  Well, if you know the movie, or if you've ridden the ride, the city of Tortuga is being attacked.
[2343.26 --> 2346.28]  And there are some pirates who are in prison.
[2346.46 --> 2349.48]  They are in a dungeon and they are locked up.
[2350.20 --> 2356.54]  And they're trying to, if you remember, they're trying to lure this dog who has the keys in his mouth, right?
[2356.58 --> 2359.30]  There's a key ring and he's got the big keys to the jail cell.
[2359.30 --> 2362.96]  And the dog stands there, sits there with the keys.
[2363.34 --> 2365.44]  And the prisoners are like, you know, come on, dog, come on.
[2365.50 --> 2367.40]  And they wave bones and they whistle to it.
[2367.52 --> 2374.70]  And they try to get the dog close enough so that they can grab the keys and unlock the prison doors and escape.
[2376.04 --> 2376.22]  Right?
[2376.26 --> 2381.00]  The idea is the key is the way to rescue.
[2381.90 --> 2385.58]  It's good to have the key to open the way to freedom.
[2385.58 --> 2386.34]  Right?
[2386.40 --> 2394.40]  To get out of the place where you don't want to be in the dungeon cell and to enter maybe into a place where you do want to go.
[2395.80 --> 2397.98]  And keys, they do this uniquely.
[2398.58 --> 2398.78]  Right?
[2398.84 --> 2401.98]  There's only one key per lock.
[2402.84 --> 2405.30]  At least back in the old days before you could copy them so easily.
[2405.30 --> 2409.42]  Actually, you know, on my house now, there's a keypad.
[2409.64 --> 2410.86]  So you just type in, do, do, do, do.
[2411.66 --> 2414.10]  But anyway, there used to be these things called keys.
[2416.40 --> 2419.14]  And there was only one key per lock.
[2420.30 --> 2424.02]  So the pirates, you know, they may have a key to a treasure chest.
[2424.02 --> 2428.72]  But unless they have the key to the prison door, they won't be able to open it.
[2429.52 --> 2435.00]  So keys are particular, they're specific, and they are cut just right.
[2435.90 --> 2439.24]  And friends, in this way, Jesus is the key.
[2440.24 --> 2440.46]  Right?
[2440.52 --> 2446.60]  Like a key fit for a prison door, Jesus sets us free from our dungeons of sin and death.
[2446.60 --> 2454.44]  Like a key fit for a treasure chest, Jesus opens up to us all the promises of God.
[2455.82 --> 2463.96]  Like a key fit for a puzzle kind of contraption, Jesus unveils the mystery of who God is and what he's like.
[2465.20 --> 2469.64]  And this metaphor of the key is actually kind of, we see it scattered throughout the Bible.
[2469.64 --> 2479.48]  In fact, the Bible begins with the closing of a door and it ends with the opening of another door.
[2480.52 --> 2486.70]  So way back in the very beginning in the first chapters of Genesis, Genesis chapter 3, right?
[2486.80 --> 2492.68]  After Adam and Eve's rebellion against God, Genesis 3, 24 says this.
[2492.68 --> 2499.32]  God drove the man out of the garden and he placed on the east side of the garden of Eden cherubim.
[2499.88 --> 2506.18]  And a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
[2507.10 --> 2509.90]  In other words, closing the door to paradise.
[2511.20 --> 2516.12]  But then in the very last book of the Bible, the lock is sprung, the door is open.
[2517.18 --> 2518.36]  The curse is lifted.
[2518.36 --> 2520.94]  So Revelation chapter 4, verse 1.
[2521.38 --> 2527.66]  After this I looked and there before me was a door standing open to heaven.
[2529.42 --> 2535.34]  So we're talking about this imagery of keys that open doors in general.
[2536.20 --> 2539.90]  But let's talk about the key of David specifically here.
[2540.40 --> 2544.10]  And it comes up again in Isaiah chapter 22, verse 22.
[2545.56 --> 2546.54]  Here it is.
[2546.54 --> 2550.10]  I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David.
[2550.54 --> 2552.56]  What he opens, no one can shut.
[2552.84 --> 2555.84]  What he shuts, no one can open.
[2556.78 --> 2563.38]  So in the Old Testament, that phrase, key of David, is used only here.
[2563.76 --> 2565.94]  Only this one time in all the Old Testament.
[2566.66 --> 2570.28]  And actually it's not given in a messianic prophecy.
[2571.18 --> 2571.30]  Right?
[2571.34 --> 2574.92]  The key of David here is not actually describing the coming Messiah.
[2574.92 --> 2579.40]  But instead it describes a man named Eliakim.
[2580.04 --> 2585.76]  Who was a good leader initially, a good leader of God's people, but who ultimately fails.
[2586.76 --> 2593.62]  Only later in the book of Revelation do we find this title, the key of David, being applied to Jesus.
[2594.62 --> 2600.08]  But before we get there, before we get to Revelation and Jesus, let's see what is happening here in Isaiah.
[2600.08 --> 2608.28]  And so a major theme of the book of Isaiah is the unwillingness of Judah's kings to trust in God.
[2609.24 --> 2613.54]  It was a politically tumultuous time.
[2614.54 --> 2618.38]  Judah was surrounded by all these other aggressive empires.
[2618.38 --> 2633.28]  And if you can kind of just imagine a map of that part of the world where Jerusalem is on the eastern side of the Mediterranean and below is Africa and, you know, above is Turkey and Europe and then kind of Asia.
[2633.28 --> 2643.02]  Well, the thing is, Jerusalem is not in a very well positioned place when it comes to warfare.
[2643.30 --> 2643.64]  Right?
[2643.68 --> 2645.04]  It's just not in a good place.
[2645.40 --> 2647.16]  It's great for times of peace.
[2647.40 --> 2647.84]  Right?
[2647.92 --> 2654.78]  Especially in the ancient world because of all the crossroads of Europe and Africa and Asia.
[2655.18 --> 2657.22]  There were trade routes that went through Jerusalem.
[2657.72 --> 2659.40]  That was great in times of peace.
[2659.46 --> 2660.50]  It made them very prosperous.
[2660.50 --> 2669.94]  And that is one of the reasons why Christianity spread so quickly from Jerusalem to all these other parts of the world, as we saw in the book of Acts.
[2670.32 --> 2670.50]  Right?
[2670.56 --> 2674.18]  Because of how well connected it was to all these parts of the world.
[2674.92 --> 2679.48]  But in times of war, these crossroads become crosshairs.
[2680.26 --> 2683.12]  In times of war, Jerusalem is not a good place to be.
[2683.58 --> 2688.02]  And that created a lot of stress for Judah's kings.
[2688.02 --> 2692.14]  So, but instead of trusting in God.
[2692.68 --> 2694.12]  Because God chose Jerusalem.
[2694.24 --> 2696.16]  God knew where it was.
[2696.36 --> 2699.58]  And he put it there so that his people would trust in him.
[2700.30 --> 2707.24]  But rather than trusting him, Israel's kings resorted to their own schemes to try to protect Judah.
[2707.70 --> 2710.24]  So they would make treaties with these foreign nations.
[2710.24 --> 2712.32]  They would build tall walls.
[2712.32 --> 2714.40]  And they would redirect water supplies.
[2715.52 --> 2722.90]  So rather than trusting in Yahweh, the God of Israel, the one who promised to protect and provide for them,
[2723.12 --> 2726.36]  they did all of these other things to try to protect themselves.
[2727.84 --> 2730.82]  And so we see this, for example, in Isaiah 22.
[2730.96 --> 2734.60]  If you just look a couple verses before in verses 10 and 11.
[2734.60 --> 2737.96]  Listen, this is what God says to his people.
[2739.26 --> 2745.30]  God says, you counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the walls.
[2745.96 --> 2750.70]  You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool.
[2751.58 --> 2752.56]  But then listen to this.
[2752.56 --> 2755.44]  But you did not look to the one who made it.
[2755.84 --> 2760.02]  Or have regard for the one who planned it long ago.
[2761.36 --> 2764.68]  In other words, rather than putting their trust in God,
[2765.18 --> 2767.66]  they were putting their trust in themselves.
[2768.06 --> 2769.22]  In their own strategies.
[2769.64 --> 2770.48]  In their own walls.
[2770.64 --> 2772.08]  Their own water supplies.
[2773.08 --> 2775.16]  And that's really the theme of Isaiah 22.
[2775.96 --> 2780.34]  It's God's indictment against the people of Judah for not trusting him.
[2780.34 --> 2790.04]  And one of the ways that God did provide and protect for his people was by giving them good leaders.
[2790.94 --> 2795.26]  And he does that in particular with this guy we see here, Eliakim.
[2795.80 --> 2797.28]  We read about him in our passage.
[2798.18 --> 2798.98]  Who is Eliakim?
[2799.08 --> 2803.72]  Eliakim is a high court official in the service of King Hezekiah.
[2804.04 --> 2808.48]  King Hezekiah was the king of Judah at the time of this chapter.
[2808.48 --> 2815.84]  Now, King Hezekiah, actually he is suffering from a terrible illness.
[2816.50 --> 2820.46]  And you could read more about that in 2 Kings chapters 18 and 19.
[2821.62 --> 2828.72]  So Eliakim, as a high court official, is given more influence, more impact, more responsibility
[2828.72 --> 2834.64]  than he would have otherwise under different circumstances if the king wasn't so sick.
[2834.64 --> 2838.92]  And Eliakim seems to be a pretty impressive guy.
[2839.72 --> 2839.86]  Right?
[2839.92 --> 2844.30]  If you, you know, you read the description of him in this passage and you're kind of like,
[2844.38 --> 2848.24]  well, you know, surely he is the solution to Judah's problems.
[2849.20 --> 2849.66]  Right?
[2849.76 --> 2853.14]  So again, look at verses 20 and 21 in our passage.
[2853.66 --> 2854.48]  It says this,
[2854.48 --> 2881.52]  Doesn't that sound exactly like what Judah needs?
[2881.52 --> 2882.42]  Right?
[2882.60 --> 2884.78]  Eliakim, he is called by God.
[2885.54 --> 2887.44]  God has given him authority.
[2888.28 --> 2889.76]  In other words, he is God's man.
[2891.30 --> 2898.50]  And then as you read about Eliakim, you see why God would use someone like that.
[2898.68 --> 2898.82]  Right?
[2898.92 --> 2900.84]  He's described as trustworthy.
[2901.38 --> 2902.84]  He's described as faithful.
[2903.50 --> 2905.74]  He's described as being a father to the people.
[2905.82 --> 2906.88]  The people liked him.
[2907.08 --> 2908.04]  He cared for them.
[2908.04 --> 2909.34]  They trusted him.
[2909.34 --> 2913.06]  And then God says this in verse 23.
[2914.16 --> 2914.86]  He says,
[2915.06 --> 2918.78]  I will drive him like a peg into a firm place.
[2919.94 --> 2930.48]  And here that peg is referring to a tent peg that would hold firm the tent of Judah in the windstorm of all the empires around them.
[2930.48 --> 2936.72]  Do you know anybody like this?
[2938.14 --> 2941.78]  Have you ever known anyone like Eliakim?
[2942.36 --> 2945.00]  You know, I've known a few people like this in my life.
[2945.16 --> 2947.44]  People who are strong and steady.
[2948.80 --> 2948.96]  Right?
[2949.00 --> 2950.22]  And not just for themselves,
[2950.22 --> 2955.12]  but they actually become a support to all the people around them.
[2955.94 --> 2956.16]  Right?
[2956.20 --> 2960.78]  People in their family or in their workplace or in their church.
[2962.08 --> 2963.96]  Eliakim is one of these people.
[2964.38 --> 2964.48]  Right?
[2964.54 --> 2967.94]  He is clearly the kind of leader that we want to follow.
[2968.16 --> 2970.06]  He's the guy we want to be.
[2970.06 --> 2973.54]  He's full of integrity.
[2973.74 --> 2975.00]  He's full of faithfulness.
[2975.34 --> 2976.86]  He is strong and steady.
[2976.96 --> 2978.10]  He is a father to the people.
[2979.48 --> 2981.92]  And this is why in verse 22, God says,
[2982.40 --> 2985.14]  He will give to Eliakim the key to the house of David.
[2985.96 --> 2986.60]  Now he says,
[2986.88 --> 2989.54]  I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David.
[2989.88 --> 2991.84]  What he opens, no one can shut.
[2992.06 --> 2993.58]  What he shuts, no one can open.
[2993.82 --> 2994.66]  Now what does that mean?
[2994.66 --> 3000.72]  Eliakim is being given a really important responsibility
[3000.72 --> 3004.12]  as steward of the house of David.
[3004.90 --> 3004.96]  Right?
[3005.06 --> 3008.64]  And so the king is the king of David, King Hezekiah.
[3008.86 --> 3013.32]  But he now is being given this key of the house of David
[3013.32 --> 3015.60]  because of the sickness of King Hezekiah.
[3016.32 --> 3017.88]  And what this means is two things.
[3018.00 --> 3021.72]  On the one hand, he has access to the palace and to the king.
[3022.42 --> 3022.62]  Right?
[3022.62 --> 3027.42]  No one gets an audience with a king unless they come through Eliakim,
[3027.72 --> 3028.86]  unless he gives the okay.
[3029.84 --> 3032.82]  Second, he is actually given the government of the kingdom.
[3033.56 --> 3033.68]  Right?
[3033.74 --> 3036.96]  The shutting and opening means the power to make decisions,
[3037.40 --> 3040.50]  which no one but the king can override.
[3041.36 --> 3043.34]  This is an incredibly important job.
[3044.22 --> 3047.44]  And Eliakim seems to be the man for the job.
[3049.18 --> 3050.18]  But there's a but.
[3050.70 --> 3051.44]  There's a problem.
[3051.44 --> 3053.28]  There's a problem in the very next verse.
[3053.46 --> 3055.00]  Well, verse 25.
[3056.06 --> 3056.16]  Right?
[3056.30 --> 3059.40]  Having told us just how wonderful Eliakim is,
[3059.88 --> 3061.00]  God then says this.
[3062.04 --> 3063.92]  In that day, declares the Lord Almighty,
[3064.52 --> 3068.66]  the peg driven into the firm place will give way.
[3069.24 --> 3071.76]  It will be sheared off and will fall.
[3072.32 --> 3075.06]  And the load hanging on it will be cut down.
[3075.46 --> 3077.36]  The Lord has spoken.
[3077.36 --> 3083.62]  So with the fall of this good leader, Eliakim,
[3084.16 --> 3091.72]  this illustrates a different way to avoid or to resist trusting in God.
[3093.02 --> 3096.58]  There's a, if you ever want to read a commentary on the book of Isaiah,
[3097.14 --> 3099.54]  a good commentator is Alex Motier.
[3099.96 --> 3100.82]  I'm not sure how to say his name.
[3101.46 --> 3101.98]  Motier.
[3102.58 --> 3103.04]  Not Motier.
[3103.20 --> 3103.64]  Don't say Motier.
[3103.64 --> 3105.64]  Anyway, Alex.
[3105.84 --> 3106.34]  Alex M.
[3107.22 --> 3108.68]  This is what he writes.
[3110.02 --> 3110.42]  He says,
[3110.56 --> 3117.28]  The reliable office holder attracts to himself the respect and confidence of people.
[3117.28 --> 3122.10]  But should this become a reliance on a human person,
[3122.70 --> 3124.70]  replacing reliance on the Lord,
[3125.52 --> 3127.32]  the end is calamity.
[3128.66 --> 3131.02]  And so the people were basically saying to themselves,
[3131.28 --> 3132.98]  I'm not going to trust God.
[3133.60 --> 3136.22]  I'm going to trust a king who trusts God.
[3137.00 --> 3138.72]  Ah, problem solved.
[3138.86 --> 3139.02]  Right?
[3139.66 --> 3141.06]  But friends, there is a difference.
[3141.32 --> 3141.50]  Right?
[3142.04 --> 3145.72]  And basically what they did was they turned Eliakim into an idol,
[3146.36 --> 3148.92]  which is exactly what God did not want them to do.
[3149.54 --> 3151.12]  That is not the purpose of a king.
[3152.38 --> 3157.12]  So Eliakim, he's chosen to be like a peg in a secure place.
[3157.50 --> 3160.90]  But instead, the people treat Eliakim like a wall peg.
[3161.24 --> 3162.80]  So I was kind of confused about this imagery.
[3163.00 --> 3164.18]  So this is what I understand.
[3164.66 --> 3168.22]  The peg was driven into the ground to stabilize a tent.
[3168.22 --> 3169.48]  But it's a tent.
[3169.72 --> 3171.36]  So how do you want to hang stuff in your tent?
[3171.48 --> 3173.48]  Well, you tie a rope to that tent peg,
[3173.64 --> 3174.74]  and then you string it up,
[3175.02 --> 3178.64]  and then you can hang stuff like pots and cups in your home.
[3179.26 --> 3182.56]  So he was this tent peg that was secure,
[3182.70 --> 3183.98]  to secure the house of Israel.
[3184.60 --> 3189.46]  But what happened was the people were just hanging all this stuff on him.
[3189.46 --> 3195.60]  They would treat him like this wall peg,
[3195.94 --> 3198.48]  which they would hang on all of their hopes,
[3198.60 --> 3200.42]  all of their dreams, all of their expectations.
[3200.94 --> 3202.30]  He will protect us.
[3202.62 --> 3204.86]  He will provide for us.
[3205.34 --> 3205.56]  Right?
[3205.60 --> 3206.80]  We don't have to repent.
[3207.32 --> 3208.70]  We don't have to change.
[3208.76 --> 3210.08]  We don't have to trust in God.
[3210.32 --> 3212.18]  We're going to trust in Eliakim.
[3212.18 --> 3222.16]  But listen to what God says much earlier in Isaiah chapter 2.
[3223.28 --> 3224.70]  God had already said this.
[3225.48 --> 3230.88]  Stop trusting in mere humans who have but a breath in their nostrils.
[3231.46 --> 3233.14]  Why hold them in esteem?
[3235.02 --> 3235.24]  Right?
[3235.30 --> 3237.20]  And so they were falling into the same trap,
[3237.74 --> 3239.18]  putting all their hope in men.
[3239.18 --> 3242.54]  And it seems at least, we don't really know,
[3242.62 --> 3246.56]  but it seems that Eliakim fell into the same trap himself.
[3247.06 --> 3247.48]  Right?
[3247.58 --> 3251.72]  Where he imagined that he was actually strong enough to hold everything.
[3252.70 --> 3254.28]  He must have thought to himself,
[3255.06 --> 3257.60]  you know, God has made me responsible for this kingdom.
[3258.22 --> 3259.86]  I have got to take care of these people.
[3259.96 --> 3260.92]  I've got to provide for them.
[3260.98 --> 3262.70]  I've got to protect them from these enemies.
[3262.96 --> 3264.04]  I have to lead them.
[3264.22 --> 3265.18]  It's all on me.
[3265.18 --> 3270.42]  And in doing that, he put himself outside the bounds of his mandate.
[3271.36 --> 3273.38]  And the people considered him,
[3273.62 --> 3277.46]  and he considered himself more important than he actually was.
[3278.54 --> 3281.38]  Eliakim quite literally had a Messiah complex.
[3282.64 --> 3286.10]  And for that, Eliakim and Judah, they both fall.
[3286.10 --> 3290.58]  And so, however competent or however wise,
[3290.94 --> 3293.56]  however capable a man like Eliakim is,
[3293.62 --> 3297.78]  he is not worthy of our ultimate trust and confidence.
[3298.82 --> 3302.04]  And friends, you know, this is a story of caution for us as well.
[3303.10 --> 3305.22]  The caution is, if you are a Christian,
[3305.86 --> 3310.78]  you should not hang all of your hopes and dreams on any man or any woman.
[3311.78 --> 3312.26]  Right?
[3312.26 --> 3314.64]  And that goes for spouses.
[3315.54 --> 3316.40]  Sometimes we do that.
[3316.46 --> 3319.24]  We put all of our hopes and expectations on our spouse.
[3319.98 --> 3322.52]  Or we put all of our hopes and expectations on our children.
[3324.08 --> 3326.04]  Or on our church leaders.
[3326.86 --> 3331.00]  Or on our, you know, a CEO, a politician, a podcaster,
[3331.24 --> 3333.64]  a social media influencer, whoever it is.
[3333.78 --> 3335.36]  We look to these kind of people.
[3336.86 --> 3339.24]  But as, you know, I heard this saying,
[3339.24 --> 3341.62]  the best of men are men at best.
[3342.26 --> 3342.74]  Right?
[3342.80 --> 3344.16]  And we always have to remember that.
[3345.50 --> 3347.94]  You know, and I think when we think about our church here,
[3348.56 --> 3353.58]  you know, maybe a church finds that God has raised up an Eliakim for them.
[3353.86 --> 3354.94]  And that is great.
[3355.62 --> 3358.48]  But even then, there is a temptation.
[3359.28 --> 3359.40]  Right?
[3359.44 --> 3363.38]  The temptation will be for the church to put its trust in the Eliakim
[3363.38 --> 3366.34]  and not in Emmanuel, God with us.
[3366.34 --> 3371.38]  You know, and when we look at the leaders that God has raised up in our church, right?
[3371.42 --> 3376.06]  Our elders, our deacons, our people who lead all these different ministries,
[3376.50 --> 3378.34]  we can be grateful for that.
[3378.66 --> 3379.02]  Right?
[3379.04 --> 3379.82]  We should be grateful.
[3380.04 --> 3383.24]  And they are worthy of trust and honor?
[3384.08 --> 3384.52]  Absolutely.
[3384.52 --> 3384.64]  Absolutely.
[3385.48 --> 3388.58]  As much as they prove themselves to be trustworthy.
[3389.90 --> 3392.96]  But it can become easy to think, well, as long as she's around,
[3393.54 --> 3397.84]  or as long as, you know, he is leading this ministry or this thing,
[3397.92 --> 3399.40]  well, then it's going to be okay.
[3399.78 --> 3400.50]  We have them.
[3400.50 --> 3405.64]  You know, we might have a lot of different Eliakims in our church.
[3406.02 --> 3409.96]  We might have different Eliakims in our wider Christian community.
[3410.10 --> 3414.70]  People, maybe, you know, authors or other pastors or whoever that we admire,
[3414.88 --> 3417.06]  that we read and listen to and look up to.
[3417.66 --> 3424.14]  But it can become easy for us to shift our trust from God to them.
[3424.70 --> 3425.14]  Right?
[3425.24 --> 3426.60]  Somebody that God has used.
[3427.44 --> 3427.58]  Right?
[3427.58 --> 3430.36]  However secure a peg they may seem,
[3430.64 --> 3434.20]  they are not the place to put all of our weight and all of our trust.
[3434.76 --> 3435.68]  That's only for God.
[3437.16 --> 3437.40]  Right?
[3437.46 --> 3439.30]  And so whether in this passage, you know,
[3439.36 --> 3443.80]  it's alliances with foreign nations or building walls or, you know,
[3443.94 --> 3448.62]  rerouting water supplies or looking to leaders, right?
[3448.66 --> 3451.76]  What they're doing is they're not looking to God to save them.
[3452.00 --> 3453.48]  And it led to their downfall.
[3453.48 --> 3454.04]  Okay.
[3455.26 --> 3461.40]  So that was a lot of background on the metaphor of the key in Isaiah.
[3462.12 --> 3466.40]  But let's turn now specifically to look at Jesus.
[3467.10 --> 3470.00]  The coming of the key.
[3470.32 --> 3470.42]  Right?
[3470.50 --> 3472.16]  The true key of David.
[3473.26 --> 3475.82]  And we find that reference in the book of Revelation.
[3476.66 --> 3478.52]  It's from a passage we read earlier.
[3478.52 --> 3480.86]  And so Revelation, it begins with these seven letters.
[3481.84 --> 3485.42]  The Apostle John was told to write down what he saw in a vision
[3485.42 --> 3489.22]  and to send it to seven churches that are in modern day Turkey.
[3489.98 --> 3495.20]  And in each letter, we see a picture of who Jesus is.
[3496.46 --> 3499.80]  And so Revelation chapter 3 verse 7 says this.
[3499.80 --> 3507.12]  These are the words of him who is holy and true,
[3507.52 --> 3510.32]  who holds the key of David.
[3510.70 --> 3512.64]  What he opens, no one can shut.
[3512.80 --> 3515.42]  And what he shuts, no one can open.
[3516.14 --> 3520.58]  See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut.
[3521.72 --> 3522.82]  So there it is.
[3523.72 --> 3525.80]  Jesus, the key of David.
[3525.80 --> 3531.84]  So in Isaiah chapter 22, the one who holds the key of David,
[3532.10 --> 3535.48]  remember he has access to the palace, right?
[3536.40 --> 3541.02]  Well, Jesus, he has access not to an earthly palace,
[3541.32 --> 3543.52]  but access to the kingdom of God.
[3543.76 --> 3546.84]  Access to the presence of the eternal king.
[3548.16 --> 3551.74]  And in Isaiah, Eliakim was given to govern the kingdom.
[3551.74 --> 3555.00]  But Jesus, he governs not an earthly kingdom,
[3555.12 --> 3558.42]  but he governs the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven.
[3559.58 --> 3561.68]  And so, you know, in this way, we can say that
[3561.68 --> 3564.92]  Jesus is the true and the better Eliakim.
[3565.08 --> 3568.64]  He is the Eliakim that didn't fall and fail,
[3569.06 --> 3572.64]  but the Eliakim who God needed,
[3572.78 --> 3575.48]  or who the people needed him to be, right?
[3575.58 --> 3576.98]  Jesus is the key of David.
[3577.26 --> 3580.22]  He is the one who can unlock all the prisons of this world
[3580.22 --> 3582.26]  and open the doors of God's kingdom.
[3583.58 --> 3587.20]  So last week, I mentioned this pastor and poet
[3587.20 --> 3588.20]  named Malcolm Gite,
[3588.30 --> 3590.82]  and he has written a series of poems
[3590.82 --> 3594.62]  based on these names of Jesus, these antiphons.
[3595.70 --> 3598.74]  And this is what he wrote about the key of David.
[3598.88 --> 3600.32]  I just want to read part of it for you.
[3601.04 --> 3601.88]  This is what he writes.
[3601.88 --> 3607.22]  Every lock must answer to a key.
[3607.22 --> 3611.44]  Each dark clasp, sharp and intricate,
[3611.88 --> 3615.38]  must find a counter clasp to meet its guard.
[3616.72 --> 3617.50]  And he continues,
[3617.84 --> 3620.86]  I cry out for the key that I threw away.
[3621.34 --> 3622.66]  And he wrote about this,
[3622.70 --> 3624.36]  saying at one point he had kind of walked away
[3624.36 --> 3625.12]  from the faith a bit.
[3625.68 --> 3626.22]  So he says,
[3626.22 --> 3628.24]  I cry out for the key that I threw away.
[3629.14 --> 3632.46]  That turned and overturned with certain touch
[3632.46 --> 3635.44]  and with a lovely lifting of a latch
[3635.44 --> 3638.80]  opened my darkness to the light of day.
[3640.06 --> 3642.72]  Oh, come again, come quickly, set me free.
[3643.72 --> 3646.74]  Cut to the quick to fit the master key.
[3648.80 --> 3649.86]  It's a beautiful poem.
[3649.86 --> 3653.64]  And Jesus, friends, is the master key.
[3654.52 --> 3657.22]  He is the only one who can fit the lock.
[3657.76 --> 3660.46]  The only one who can set us free from our dungeons
[3660.46 --> 3664.62]  of sin and death that we find ourselves in in this world.
[3665.68 --> 3665.88]  Right?
[3665.96 --> 3668.42]  He became, Jesus became the peg
[3668.42 --> 3671.64]  on which we can hang all of our sin.
[3672.32 --> 3673.98]  All of our self-sufficiency.
[3674.22 --> 3676.52]  All of our failure to trust in God.
[3676.58 --> 3677.82]  We can hang it all on Jesus.
[3677.82 --> 3679.92]  And like Eliakim,
[3680.08 --> 3681.96]  when Jesus took all of our sin,
[3682.50 --> 3684.16]  our sin tore him from the wall.
[3684.44 --> 3685.00]  He fell.
[3685.76 --> 3687.76]  With all of our sin hung on him,
[3687.86 --> 3689.14]  Jesus was sheared off.
[3689.44 --> 3690.90]  He was put to death on the cross.
[3691.16 --> 3693.26]  Both by us, by our sin,
[3693.90 --> 3696.10]  and by God for our sin.
[3697.28 --> 3699.08]  But unlike Eliakim,
[3699.96 --> 3701.90]  Jesus trusted in God completely.
[3702.86 --> 3704.82]  He was the leader of his people
[3704.82 --> 3706.22]  who never faltered.
[3706.22 --> 3708.94]  He was the true father of his people.
[3709.08 --> 3712.54]  He was strong enough to bear all of our hopes and expectations,
[3712.86 --> 3714.74]  to carry them for us,
[3715.12 --> 3716.76]  to carry our sin for us,
[3717.06 --> 3718.22]  and then to rise again,
[3719.00 --> 3721.18]  conquering our enemies of sin and death,
[3721.32 --> 3722.70]  opening all of the doors.
[3724.24 --> 3725.08]  And because of that,
[3725.18 --> 3727.76]  Jesus can say this in Revelation chapter 1.
[3728.50 --> 3728.94]  He says,
[3728.94 --> 3729.56]  Fear not,
[3729.72 --> 3732.00]  I am the first and the last,
[3732.06 --> 3732.76]  the living one.
[3732.90 --> 3733.86]  I died,
[3734.28 --> 3734.84]  and behold,
[3734.96 --> 3736.66]  I am alive forevermore,
[3736.94 --> 3738.14]  and I have,
[3738.20 --> 3738.44]  what?
[3739.38 --> 3740.36]  The keys
[3740.36 --> 3741.66]  of death
[3741.66 --> 3742.86]  and Hades.
[3742.86 --> 3746.50]  All right,
[3746.58 --> 3748.24]  so by way of application,
[3748.88 --> 3751.66]  I just want to ask a few questions,
[3751.86 --> 3754.06]  give us a few questions to ponder today,
[3754.18 --> 3758.00]  and maybe to take with us throughout the week.
[3759.28 --> 3761.74]  So the first question is this,
[3762.92 --> 3764.66]  have you received Jesus as the key?
[3764.66 --> 3770.10]  He is the one who gives access to the Father.
[3770.24 --> 3771.48]  There is no other key.
[3772.36 --> 3772.84]  Jesus says,
[3773.08 --> 3773.92]  I am the way,
[3774.64 --> 3775.12]  the truth,
[3775.18 --> 3775.50]  and the life.
[3775.60 --> 3777.62]  No one comes to the Father except through me.
[3780.22 --> 3782.82]  So when you put your trust in him,
[3782.96 --> 3786.68]  he will open the door to his eternal kingdom,
[3786.82 --> 3788.10]  and no one can keep you out.
[3788.20 --> 3789.26]  No one else can shut it.
[3791.30 --> 3794.64]  But not only does Jesus open the door to our home with God,
[3794.66 --> 3798.52]  he also sets us free from our prisons of sin.
[3799.22 --> 3800.88]  And so the second question is,
[3801.08 --> 3804.70]  what specifically do you need to be freed from?
[3806.20 --> 3806.44]  All right,
[3806.50 --> 3807.82]  what are your prisons?
[3808.10 --> 3809.34]  What are your shackles?
[3810.26 --> 3811.52]  Where are you trapped?
[3811.72 --> 3812.88]  Or where do you,
[3813.30 --> 3813.52]  you know,
[3813.56 --> 3814.80]  where do you feel stuck?
[3816.44 --> 3819.32]  And what does it mean for you to know that Jesus is the key?
[3820.10 --> 3823.38]  He is the key that can set you free from whatever that is.
[3824.02 --> 3824.46]  Right?
[3824.66 --> 3826.22]  He can set you free from any sin.
[3826.44 --> 3826.92]  Right?
[3826.98 --> 3828.08]  Whether it's anger,
[3828.52 --> 3829.18]  or lust,
[3829.82 --> 3831.24]  or unforgiveness,
[3831.68 --> 3832.24]  or pride,
[3832.30 --> 3832.88]  whatever it is,
[3832.96 --> 3835.56]  Jesus is the key that can open that prison door.
[3836.66 --> 3839.60]  So what do you need Jesus to free you from?
[3841.28 --> 3843.16]  And then the third and final question
[3843.16 --> 3844.76]  is about mission.
[3844.76 --> 3848.44]  How are you helping to set other people free?
[3848.44 --> 3851.32]  Or another way to ask it is,
[3851.50 --> 3854.28]  who are you helping to set free?
[3855.80 --> 3856.30]  Because,
[3856.40 --> 3856.52]  you know,
[3856.58 --> 3859.48]  in this kind of crazy and maybe unexpected way,
[3860.20 --> 3866.32]  Jesus invites us to join him in this work of setting people free.
[3866.32 --> 3869.56]  Listen to what Jesus says in Matthew 16.
[3869.56 --> 3870.96]  He says,
[3871.10 --> 3873.70]  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
[3875.30 --> 3876.10]  That's crazy.
[3877.36 --> 3878.66]  The key of David.
[3880.02 --> 3880.52]  He says,
[3880.60 --> 3881.36]  I give you the keys.
[3881.48 --> 3882.72]  He shares them with us.
[3882.78 --> 3883.98]  He invites us to join him.
[3884.42 --> 3886.56]  Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven.
[3886.88 --> 3888.76]  Whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[3888.76 --> 3890.46]  And that means,
[3890.88 --> 3894.00]  as you and I make known the gospel of forgiveness,
[3894.70 --> 3899.46]  as we testify to God's liberating freedom in our own lives,
[3899.72 --> 3901.86]  as we welcome people to know God,
[3901.98 --> 3903.34]  welcome them into the church,
[3904.16 --> 3906.74]  God makes his appeal through you.
[3908.26 --> 3909.16]  And so here's the question.
[3909.28 --> 3910.76]  Who is God leading you to
[3910.76 --> 3913.16]  to tell the message of salvation
[3913.16 --> 3915.00]  that by grace and through faith,
[3916.00 --> 3918.48]  it would open the doors of the kingdom to that person?
[3919.22 --> 3920.16]  That's our question.
[3921.20 --> 3923.60]  And that's the signal that we should pray.
[3924.32 --> 3925.14]  Good timing.
[3925.56 --> 3925.80]  Okay.
[3925.98 --> 3926.76]  Let's pray together.
[3928.12 --> 3928.94]  Heavenly Father,
[3929.08 --> 3930.22]  we thank you for Jesus,
[3930.44 --> 3931.22]  the key of David.
[3932.22 --> 3933.34]  We thank you for the key
[3933.34 --> 3934.86]  that can open the prison doors
[3934.86 --> 3935.86]  and set us free.
[3936.22 --> 3938.70]  The key that can open wide our heavenly home.
[3940.00 --> 3940.44]  And Lord,
[3940.54 --> 3942.18]  we await the coming of your kingdom
[3942.18 --> 3944.62]  when we will finally be at home with you
[3944.62 --> 3946.46]  in the new heavens and the new earth
[3946.46 --> 3948.74]  for all time and eternity.
[3949.62 --> 3951.64]  And we pray that you would give us courage
[3951.64 --> 3953.90]  as we wait
[3953.90 --> 3955.54]  and as we live for you
[3955.54 --> 3956.48]  as ambassadors,
[3956.68 --> 3957.50]  as stewards
[3957.50 --> 3959.12]  of your kingdom.
[3960.72 --> 3962.08]  Lord, we are yours.
[3963.10 --> 3963.42]  Jesus,
[3963.82 --> 3965.22]  be our leader.
[3966.10 --> 3967.44]  We ask in Christ's name.
[3968.00 --> 3968.32]  Amen.
[3968.32 --> 3968.42]  Amen.
[3968.42 --> 3969.34]  Amen.
[3970.60 --> 3971.14]  All right.
[3971.20 --> 3973.48]  So as the worship team comes up,
[3973.92 --> 3975.58]  I'll invite you to stand
[3975.58 --> 3977.96]  and we will sing again,
[3978.04 --> 3978.96]  O Come, O Come, Emanuel,
[3979.22 --> 3981.78]  adding our fourth verse,
[3982.42 --> 3982.96]  O Key of David.
[3983.10 --> 3984.16]  Please stand and we'll sing.
[3984.16 --> 3984.28]  Amen.
[3984.28 --> 4014.26]  Thank you.
[4014.28 --> 4044.26]  Thank you.
[4044.28 --> 4046.28]  Thank you.
[4046.28 --> 4048.28]  Thank you.
[4076.28 --> 4078.28]  Thank you.
[4106.28 --> 4108.28]  Thank you.
[4136.28 --> 4138.28]  Thank you.
[4166.28 --> 4168.28]  Thank you.
[4196.28 --> 4198.28]  Thank you.
[4198.28 --> 4200.28]  Thank you.
[4200.28 --> 4202.28]  Thank you.
[4202.28 --> 4204.28]  Thank you.
[4204.28 --> 4206.28]  Thank you.
[4206.28 --> 4208.28]  Thank you.
[4208.28 --> 4210.28]  Thank you.
[4210.28 --> 4212.28]  Thank you.
[4212.28 --> 4214.28]  Thank you.
[4214.28 --> 4216.28]  Thank you.
[4216.28 --> 4218.28]  Thank you.
[4218.28 --> 4220.28]  Thank you.
[4220.28 --> 4222.28]  Thank you.
[4222.28 --> 4224.28]  Thank you.
[4224.28 --> 4226.28]  Thank you.
[4226.28 --> 4228.28]  Thank you.
[4228.28 --> 4230.28]  Thank you.
[4230.28 --> 4232.28]  Thank you.
[4232.28 --> 4234.28]  Thank you.
[4234.28 --> 4237.28]  with Israel
[4237.28 --> 4255.00]  so we continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings
[4255.00 --> 4258.84]  I believe our designated offering today is for Covenant House
[4258.84 --> 4264.08]  it's a local ministry in Vancouver that reaches out to children who need help
[4264.08 --> 4271.68]  and support in a place to be and so may I ask the deacons to come on forward and
[4271.68 --> 4278.66]  collect the morning offering I would just like to do a little introduction to
[4278.66 --> 4284.24]  the to the song that we're going to sing during the offering you know that all of
[4284.24 --> 4291.76]  us that are of Dutch origin we know that there are some very beloved songs that
[4291.76 --> 4298.64]  Dutch people always sing at this Christmas time of the year and one of
[4298.64 --> 4304.44]  those I guess the primary one is actually Eres ae haat a glory to God and we'll do
[4304.44 --> 4311.36]  that at Christmas time but there's also another one and that's called Der ruist langs de wolken
[4311.36 --> 4318.96]  I can still do my Dutch pretty good and we'd like to do that one now we were reminded
[4318.96 --> 4329.28]  of that last Tuesday when we had the funeral for Ali Haklander and the family asked me via Joe to
[4329.28 --> 4348.16]  to play some Dutch songs prior to the service and also this particular song was one that Ali really enjoyed singing all the time at Christmas time and so we'd like to do that one
[4348.16 --> 4360.88]  I was I learned of this song many years ago and I was actually able to talk to the person
[4360.88 --> 4369.04]  that like Landert Coy who actually translated this song into English and we're going to do the English version of it today and I actually
[4369.04 --> 4376.96]  telephoned him and asked him for permission to do the song and he said sure please go ahead it can do it anytime so
[4376.96 --> 4381.04]  we'd like to do the three verses of this particular song
[4381.04 --> 4400.96]  there rings through the clouds a most wonderful name
[4400.96 --> 4420.30]  There is through the clouds a most wonderful name, a name both on earth and in heaven to acclaim.
[4420.30 --> 4440.30]  O name can you sweeter, more blessed to know, it comforts and heals and restores us again.
[4440.30 --> 4450.30]  Know Him, know Him, Jesus the King.
[4450.30 --> 4461.30]  The King is my sinners, of whom I will sing.
[4461.30 --> 4473.30]  What name which my Jesus deserved through His birth.
[4473.30 --> 4483.30]  To love us in person, He came to this earth.
[4483.30 --> 4494.30]  He loved us so much, He was willing to die.
[4494.30 --> 4504.30]  So grace could come down from the Father on all.
[4504.30 --> 4515.30]  Know Him, know Him, Jesus the King.
[4515.30 --> 4526.30]  Who gave us His glory, salvation to Him.
[4526.30 --> 4538.30]  One day all creation will go to our King.
[4538.30 --> 4549.30]  One day every nation thy praises will bring.
[4549.30 --> 4560.30]  Oh, meet me together with heavenly throne.
[4560.30 --> 4571.30]  Surround me this throne, sing this heavenly song.
[4571.30 --> 4583.30]  Jesus, Jesus, ever adored.
[4583.30 --> 4596.30]  The King of creation, forever our Lord.
[4596.30 --> 4604.30]  The King of creation.
[4606.30 --> 4608.30]  That was very nice.
[4608.30 --> 4610.30]  I didn't hear much Dutch though.
[4610.30 --> 4612.30]  I was expecting a little bit more.
[4612.30 --> 4613.30]  Who was singing in Dutch?
[4613.30 --> 4614.30]  I'm just curious.
[4614.30 --> 4617.30]  That was a couple of you, that was great.
[4617.30 --> 4621.30]  Alright, let's get before the Lord in prayer, and let's bring our knees before Him.
[4621.30 --> 4625.30]  We will conclude with the Lord's Prayer and we'll put the words on the screen, and actually,
[4625.30 --> 4628.96]  the screen and actually I'd like for us to use the traditional language for that
[4628.96 --> 4638.74]  so thighs those trespasses okay but let's pray I will remember the deeds of
[4638.74 --> 4645.76]  the Lord yes I will remember your wonders of old I will ponder all your
[4645.76 --> 4652.98]  work and meditate on your mighty deeds your way oh God is holy what God is
[4652.98 --> 4659.04]  great like our God you are the God who works wonders you have made known your
[4659.04 --> 4667.26]  might among the peoples with your arm he redeemed your people oh God of power and
[4667.26 --> 4674.10]  might we bow before you in reverent awe and thanksgiving we praise you for your
[4674.10 --> 4680.52]  many wonders for the wonder of creation that you spread out in the heavens like
[4680.52 --> 4686.94]  a tent that you created land and sea and filled them both that you created us in
[4686.94 --> 4693.96]  your image to rule over and care for the earth we thank you for the wonder of
[4693.96 --> 4700.02]  redemption that you have brought to people out of darkness and into light through
[4700.02 --> 4704.94]  the person and work of Jesus Christ and that you are building a kingdom on earth
[4704.94 --> 4712.08]  in his name from of old you have been a promise making and a promise keeping God
[4712.08 --> 4718.44]  faithfully shepherding your people you continually redeem our lives from the pit
[4718.44 --> 4730.32]  and set us upon the rock because this is who you are oh Lord we pray for your mercy upon our brothers and
[4730.32 --> 4737.76]  sisters gathered here that you would redeem those parts of our lives that are deeply broken we pray
[4737.76 --> 4748.74]  especially today and ask that you would stir in us a sincere pursuit of holiness grow in us oh Lord the fruit of the spirit
[4748.74 --> 4763.74]  set our minds on things above not on things on earthly things help us to treasure your law and be both hearers and doers of your word and not hearers only and so deceiving ourselves
[4763.74 --> 4778.72]  father we ask to that you would bring healing and restoration to broken relationships in our midst would you restore troubled marriages would you bring peace to homes and
[4778.72 --> 4785.72]  that are in conflict father would you melt the hearts of the hard-hearted
