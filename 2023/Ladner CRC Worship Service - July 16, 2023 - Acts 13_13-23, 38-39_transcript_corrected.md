[208.68 → 238.66] Thank you.
[238.68 → 268.66] Thank you.
[268.68 → 270.68] Thank you.
[270.68 → 272.46] Good morning and welcome.
[273.16 → 278.38] Welcome to this place, everyone who is here, and anyone and everyone that is joining us
[278.38 → 280.12] through live stream this morning.
[280.12 → 285.46] We're glad that you've joined us to worship our creator, the one who loves us and cares
[285.46 → 286.12] for us.
[288.52 → 292.88] My name is Marian, and I will be our worship leader with the help of our worship team.
[292.88 → 298.22] And later, Pastor Jason will bring us in the church, and we'll be our guest here today.
[298.22 → 306.86] And if you are a guest here this morning, we'd love to meet you.
[306.86 → 309.24] And you are welcome.
[336.86 → 345.44] That God raised him, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be our God, and we'll
[345.44 → 353.42] call upon our true God, believing him in our hearts, confessing him with our mouths, worshipping
[353.42 → 358.76] him in spirit and in the Lord, and we'll be our God, and we'll be our God.
[358.76 → 366.90] We have come from various life experiences here this morning, each bringing our own gratitude, our own joys, anxieties, or sorrow.
[366.90 → 374.68] Our God welcomes each one of us to come as we are, as a child to a loving parent.
[375.44 → 381.84] Let's take a moment of silence to quiet our hearts before him in preparation for worship.
[396.90 → 405.28] Mighty and awesome God, creator and lover of our souls, we come before you in adoration and praise.
[405.78 → 416.48] We have come to be reminded of your greatness, your deeds of love and mercy, your healing power, and most of all, your constant care and presence in our lives.
[417.24 → 419.22] You alone are the living God.
[419.76 → 424.22] Truly, our souls find their rest in you, our rock and salvation.
[424.22 → 429.50] May our praise and worship be your delight today for the sake of your kingdom.
[430.22 → 430.48] Amen.
[431.98 → 433.76] Please rise for God's greeting.
[436.72 → 441.44] God's greeting comes to us in the words of Ephesians 1, verse 2.
[441.90 → 446.76] Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[447.62 → 451.52] Let us also take a moment to welcome one another here this morning.
[454.22 → 484.20] Thank you.
[484.22 → 485.22] Amen.
[514.22 → 520.06] Where does my help come from?
[522.38 → 534.60] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[534.60 → 548.04] Oh, how I need you, Lord. You are my only hope. You're my only hope.
[550.18 → 562.98] So I will wait for you to come and rescue me. Come and give me life.
[564.60 → 576.60] I look my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from?
[578.18 → 590.94] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[590.94 → 603.94] Oh, how I need you, Lord. You are my only hope. You're my only hope.
[603.94 → 617.94] So I will wait for you to come and rescue me. Come and give me life.
[617.94 → 631.94] I lift my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from?
[631.94 → 641.26] You may be seated.
[641.26 → 660.70] Last week, we were able to install three of our new elders.
[660.70 → 666.62] And we also thank our elders who have served their terms and completed their terms of service.
[667.42 → 671.42] And because Edgar was in Hong Kong, he's back. His family is still there.
[671.52 → 673.44] So he's a bachelor. He just told us.
[673.82 → 678.72] But he's here, and we will now install Edgar as a first-time deacon.
[678.86 → 679.72] So Edgar, come on up.
[679.72 → 679.78] Thank you.
[679.78 → 679.84] Thank you.
[679.84 → 679.92] Thank you.
[690.70 → 700.58] He's enjoying the cool Canada air very much.
[702.02 → 703.94] So we're installing Edgar as a deacon.
[704.76 → 707.82] And deacons, what is a deacon? What does a deacon do?
[707.94 → 709.04] What are the duties of a deacon?
[709.04 → 714.42] Deacons are called to the ministries of mercy and stewardship.
[715.50 → 724.18] A deacon delights in serving others, in demonstrating God's love in mercy ministries of all kinds,
[724.28 → 730.00] and faithfully managing the resources entrusted to Latter CRC by the Lord.
[731.08 → 736.88] Deacons are to care for the poor and needy, especially amongst believers in the church body.
[736.88 → 740.34] And they are to encourage others to do the same.
[741.40 → 745.80] And in all of these ministries, deacons, they demonstrate both in word and in deed,
[746.46 → 751.92] the care, the loving heart of the Lord himself who is our good shepherd.
[754.38 → 757.34] So Edgar, I'm going to ask you to take some vows.
[757.92 → 758.82] And we'll have them on the screen.
[759.88 → 764.08] And then you will answer in saying, I do, God helping me.
[764.54 → 764.76] Okay?
[765.70 → 766.10] Okay.
[766.10 → 770.36] So Edgar, in order to express your acceptance of this office,
[770.62 → 776.00] we ask you to stand in the presence of God and of his people to answer these questions.
[776.68 → 782.60] Do you believe that in the call of this congregation, God himself is calling you to this holy office?
[784.04 → 787.48] And do you believe that the Old and New Testaments are the word of God,
[787.86 → 790.48] the only infallible rule of faith and life?
[790.48 → 797.26] Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all teaching which contradicts them?
[797.26 → 807.34] And do you promise to do the work of your office faithfully in a way worthy of your calling and in submission to the government and discipline of the church?
[807.34 → 807.74] Okay.
[808.54 → 808.90] Okay.
[809.06 → 811.18] He kept saying, I do, but I'm going to give him the mic.
[811.88 → 813.14] So Edgar, what is your answer?
[813.56 → 814.14] Yes, I do.
[814.52 → 814.78] All right.
[815.34 → 815.94] You've heard it.
[815.94 → 822.58] So Edgar, I'm going to give you this charge.
[824.12 → 826.02] Edgar, as you fulfill the office of deacon,
[826.50 → 832.00] I charge you to inspire us as a congregation to faithful ministries of service to one another,
[832.58 → 834.94] to the larger community, and to the world.
[834.94 → 843.48] Remind us by word, by deed, and by your own example that the Lord requires us to act justly, to love mercy,
[844.04 → 845.50] and to walk humbly with our God.
[846.14 → 854.24] Teach us to be merciful and to seize new opportunities to worship God with our offerings of wealth and time and ability.
[855.24 → 856.90] Be compassionate to those in need.
[857.90 → 859.54] Treat them with dignity and respect.
[860.94 → 863.54] Let your life be above reproach.
[863.54 → 867.06] Live as an example of Christ Jesus.
[867.92 → 869.86] Look to the interests of others.
[870.92 → 875.64] And in all of your ministries, help us to participate in the renewal of all things,
[875.90 → 880.92] even as we anticipate its completion when God's kingdom comes.
[882.78 → 888.94] And to the congregation, I charge you, people of God, to receive Edgar Wong as Christ's gift to the church.
[888.94 → 891.26] Wholeheartedly participate in the ministries.
[891.26 → 895.24] And to which he leads you along with the other deacons.
[895.74 → 898.04] Sustain him in prayer and encouragement.
[898.90 → 902.72] And acknowledge him as the Lord's servant amongst you.
[903.32 → 904.56] Do you, congregation...
[904.56 → 906.98] Oh, please stand to say this.
[906.98 → 914.98] Do you, congregation, pledge to receive him as you have been charged?
[915.94 → 916.98] Do you, congregation, pledge to receive him as you have been charged?
[918.04 → 918.58] Thank you.
[918.64 → 919.24] You may be seated.
[919.40 → 923.40] And may I invite our current serving elders and deacons to come forward,
[923.40 → 926.84] and we will lay hands on Edgar and ordain him.
[949.08 → 949.80] Let's pray.
[949.80 → 957.00] God, our Heavenly Father, who has called you, Edgar, to this sacred office,
[957.96 → 961.16] guide you by his word, equip you with his spirit,
[961.86 → 965.70] and so prosper your ministries that his church may increase,
[965.88 → 967.86] and his name be praised.
[968.66 → 971.16] Lord, make Edgar a faithful worker in your vineyard.
[971.78 → 973.94] We pray in the name of Jesus, our Lord.
[974.38 → 974.74] Amen.
[974.74 → 974.84] Amen.
[979.80 → 992.32] Would you please rise for a few worship songs?
[992.32 → 992.88] Amen.
[992.88 → 994.88] Amen.
[1022.88 → 1029.18] Praise Him for His Lord of all salvation.
[1030.68 → 1043.42] Come all who hear, fathers and sisters, God, here, join me in the adoration.
[1044.64 → 1052.56] Praise to the Lord, Lord of all His wondrous remains.
[1052.88 → 1053.88] Amen.
[1054.88 → 1062.88] Chalking you up in His wings, O so gently subsuming.
[1064.26 → 1077.88] Have you now seen all that is equal as being, sent by His gracious ordain me?
[1077.88 → 1086.88] Praise to the Lord, Lord of all His mercy, God, here, join me in the adoration.
[1086.88 → 1096.88] All that has life and breath, God, now, in Jesus' name, Lord of all His mercy.
[1096.88 → 1104.88] Let me, amen, sound from His people again.
[1104.88 → 1110.88] Glad we forever adore Him.
[1110.88 → 1136.50] I love you, Lord.
[1136.50 → 1142.50] Your grace is the everlasting
[1142.50 → 1147.00] To all my tears
[1147.00 → 1149.80] And I can't do it
[1149.80 → 1154.36] The moment I blink
[1154.36 → 1158.80] Until I lay my head
[1158.80 → 1162.24] I was afraid
[1162.24 → 1166.08] Of the goodness of God
[1166.08 → 1173.78] All my life you have been faithful
[1173.78 → 1183.64] All my life you have been so, so good
[1183.64 → 1188.64] With every breath that I am made of
[1188.64 → 1192.12] To the light of the sun
[1192.12 → 1196.18] Of the goodness of God
[1196.18 → 1199.88] I love your voice
[1199.88 → 1201.66] I love your voice
[1201.66 → 1203.88] I bring the mirror and the mirror
[1203.88 → 1209.58] I love your voice
[1209.58 → 1211.58] I love your voice
[1211.58 → 1217.06] I know you as a father
[1217.06 → 1221.28] I know you as a friend
[1221.28 → 1229.06] I am in the goodness of God
[1229.06 → 1234.76] I know you as a friend
[1234.76 → 1236.76] I know you as a friend
[1236.76 → 1238.76] I know you as a friend
[1238.76 → 1242.46] I know you as a friend
[1242.46 → 1244.46] I know you as a friend
[1244.46 → 1246.46] I know you as a friend
[1246.46 → 1250.94] With every breath that I am waiting for,
[1250.94 → 1259.58] till I receive all the goodness of God.
[1260.94 → 1266.94] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1268.22 → 1274.22] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1274.22 → 1278.18] With my life made out of spirit and love,
[1278.18 → 1280.86] I give you everything.
[1282.92 → 1287.98] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1289.74 → 1295.32] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1297.16 → 1303.08] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1303.08 → 1307.04] With my life made out of spirit and love,
[1307.04 → 1310.04] I give you everything.
[1311.72 → 1318.04] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1318.04 → 1322.00] Your goodness is running after, it's running after, it's running after.
[1322.00 → 1325.96] Your goodness is running after, it's running after, it's running after.
[1325.96 → 1329.92] Your goodness is running after, it's running after, it's running after.
[1329.92 → 1333.88] Your goodness is running after, it's running after.
[1333.88 → 1338.42] Your goodness is running after, it's running after.
[1338.42 → 1343.74] Your goodness is running after, it's running after.
[1343.74 → 1345.90] Your goodness is running after.
[1346.38 → 1347.28] Your goodness is running after, it will tend to your life to not have a little dog crawl to our own Religion.
[1347.28 → 1356.12] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1356.12 → 1359.86] You may be seated.
[1367.44 → 1372.52] When we gather to praise God, we remember that we are selfish people
[1372.52 → 1377.16] who most often place our own desires over his will for us.
[1377.28 → 1380.66] Let's confess this together responsibly.
[1382.56 → 1386.82] Merciful God, you pardon all who truly repent and turn to you.
[1387.24 → 1390.48] We humbly confess our sins and ask your mercy.
[1391.50 → 1398.12] We have not loved you with your heart, nor have we loved our neighbour as most else.
[1399.12 → 1405.38] We have not done justice, loved kindness, or walked humbly with you, our God.
[1405.38 → 1410.76] Have mercy on us, O God, in your loving kindness.
[1411.76 → 1415.60] In your great compassion, cleanse us from our sin.
[1416.66 → 1423.00] Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew our right spirit within us.
[1423.00 → 1429.38] Do not cast us from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from us.
[1430.32 → 1433.44] Restore to us the joy of your salvation,
[1434.28 → 1437.34] and sustain us with your merciful spirit.
[1437.88 → 1440.12] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1440.18 → 1441.38] Amen.
[1441.38 → 1459.36] Lord, my role is filled with me, for you from earth and dismiss of you.
[1459.36 → 1470.90] All my heart was built on healthiness, and Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1470.90 → 1481.70] I dare not trust the sweetness play, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[1481.70 → 1496.20] On Christ the solid, on Christ the dead, all other ground is sinking sand.
[1499.46 → 1509.38] His own is fallen, and His blood support me in the loving blood.
[1509.38 → 1519.58] When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.
[1520.38 → 1530.20] On Christ the solid, on Christ the dead, all other ground is sinking sand.
[1530.20 → 1536.38] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1536.38 → 1547.34] When He shall come with trumpet sound, only I then in Him be found.
[1547.72 → 1557.34] Dressed in His righteousness alone, thoughtless to stand before the throne.
[1557.34 → 1569.34] On Christ the solid, on Christ the dead, all other ground is sinking sand.
[1569.34 → 1574.34] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1578.34 → 1584.34] The children ages three to kindergarten are excused for His life.
[1587.34 → 1590.34] May they and their teachers be blessed.
[1590.34 → 1605.34] May they and their children be blessed.
[1605.34 → 1606.38] Good morning.
[1606.38 → 1613.38] Good morning.
[1613.38 → 1614.38] Good morning.
[1614.38 → 1617.38] So we are in the sermon series in the book of Acts.
[1617.38 → 1621.38] And today we will be looking at Acts chapter 13.
[1621.38 → 1624.38] And, so please turn in your Bibles to Acts 13.
[1624.38 → 1627.38] It is on page 821 in your pew Bible.
[1627.38 → 1632.38] I would love for you to have the passage open in front of you as we look at it together.
[1632.38 → 1635.38] So page 821, Acts chapter 13.
[1635.38 → 1640.38] And so while you are turning there, let me give us some context for the passage that we are about to read.
[1640.38 → 1645.38] And let's pull up our map as we follow along what is happening.
[1645.38 → 1655.38] So last week we saw that Paul and Barnabas had just launched off on what has been called the Apostle Paul's first missionary journey.
[1655.38 → 1664.38] They left the ethnically diverse metropolis of Antioch in Syria, just north of Israel along the Mediterranean coast.
[1664.38 → 1667.38] And you can see it where there's a tag that says starting point.
[1667.38 → 1670.38] Yeah, that's what it says.
[1670.38 → 1671.38] Okay, right up there.
[1671.38 → 1686.38] And so this is, you know, in Antioch of Syria, this is where the very first multicultural church had been planted with both Jews and Gentiles in it.
[1686.38 → 1697.38] And now this church in obedience to the calling of the Holy Spirit is sending Paul and Barnabas out to preach the gospel all around the Roman Empire.
[1697.38 → 1704.38] So they first, as we saw last week, went to Cyprus, which was Barnabas' hometown.
[1704.38 → 1714.38] And they first encounter, their first encounter is with an open-minded Roman government official and an obstinate Jewish magician.
[1714.38 → 1722.38] And then through the preaching of the word of God, the spirit opens the eyes of the Roman official to believe in Jesus.
[1722.38 → 1727.38] And then he literally blinds the eyes of the Jewish man in his unbelief.
[1727.38 → 1735.38] So then they leave the island of Cyprus, and they travel to the synagogue of Pistoia Antioch.
[1735.38 → 1736.38] So it's two Antioch's.
[1736.38 → 1737.38] It's a little confusing.
[1737.38 → 1739.38] There's Antioch in Syria, where they left from.
[1739.38 → 1744.38] And now they're going to Pistoia Antioch, which is in modern day Turkey.
[1744.38 → 1751.38] And what we're about to read is actually Paul's first recorded sermon.
[1751.38 → 1757.38] Now imagine if you could go on YouTube and watch Paul's first sermon.
[1757.38 → 1760.38] Well, they weren't live-streaming back then.
[1760.38 → 1763.38] But we have it right here in our Bible.
[1763.38 → 1767.38] It's a long passage, and we're actually not going to read the entire sermon today.
[1767.38 → 1770.38] And I want to just focus on part of it.
[1770.38 → 1773.38] And we're going to read verses 13 to 33.
[1773.38 → 1777.38] And then I want to jump down and read verses 38 to 39.
[1777.38 → 1783.38] So beginning in verse 13, hear the word of the Lord.
[1783.38 → 1792.38] Soon as it's there, it's not there.
[1792.38 → 1793.38] Thank you.
[1793.38 → 1794.38] Thank you.
[1794.38 → 1795.38] Okay.
[1795.38 → 1797.38] We'll have it up here, but then after that, the scripture will be gone.
[1797.38 → 1798.38] So that's why you need your Bibles.
[1798.38 → 1800.38] But you follow on the screen for now.
[1800.38 → 1808.38] So from Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to CERGA and Pamphylia, where John,
[1808.38 → 1813.38] that's John Mark, left them to return to Jerusalem.
[1813.38 → 1816.38] From CERGA, they went on to Obsidian Antioch.
[1816.38 → 1822.38] On the Sabbath, they entered the synagogue and sat down.
[1822.38 → 1828.38] After the reading from the law and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying,
[1828.38 → 1834.38] Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.
[1834.38 → 1838.38] Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said,
[1838.38 → 1845.38] Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me.
[1845.38 → 1850.38] The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors.
[1850.38 → 1853.38] He made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt.
[1853.38 → 1857.38] With mighty power, he led them out of that country.
[1857.38 → 1861.38] For about 40 years, he endured their conduct in the wilderness.
[1861.38 → 1868.38] And he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
[1868.38 → 1872.38] All this took about 450 years.
[1872.38 → 1876.38] After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
[1876.38 → 1883.38] Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul, son of Fish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled 40 years.
[1883.38 → 1886.38] After removing Saul, he made David their king.
[1886.38 → 1888.38] God testified concerning him,
[1888.38 → 1892.38] I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart.
[1892.38 → 1895.38] He will do everything I want him to do.
[1895.38 → 1904.38] From this man's descendants, God has brought to Israel the Saviour Jesus, as he promised.
[1904.38 → 1913.38] Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel, as John was completing his work.
[1913.38 → 1914.38] He said,
[1914.38 → 1917.38] Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for.
[1917.38 → 1922.38] But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
[1927.38 → 1929.38] I don't think this is...
[1929.38 → 1931.38] I was going to stop at 33. Are we past 33?
[1931.38 → 1934.38] I will just keep reading.
[1934.38 → 1935.38] Whatever is on there.
[1935.38 → 1936.38] Okay.
[1936.38 → 1938.38] Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles,
[1938.38 → 1941.38] it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
[1941.38 → 1945.38] The people of Jerusalem and the rulers did not recognize Jesus.
[1945.38 → 1950.38] Yet in condemning him, they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sunday.
[1950.38 → 1954.38] Though they found no proper ground for death sentence,
[1954.38 → 1957.38] they asked Pilate to have him executed.
[1957.38 → 1960.38] When they had carried out all that was written about him,
[1960.38 → 1963.38] they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
[1963.38 → 1965.38] But God raised him from the dead.
[1965.38 → 1971.38] And for many days, he was seen by those who had travelled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem.
[1971.38 → 1974.38] They are now his witnesses to our people.
[1974.38 → 1976.38] We tell you the good news.
[1976.38 → 1982.38] What God promised our ancestors, he has fulfilled for us their children by raising up Jesus.
[1982.38 → 1984.38] As it is written in the second Psalm,
[1984.38 → 1986.38] You are my son.
[1986.38 → 1988.38] Today I have become your father.
[1988.38 → 1989.38] Okay.
[1989.38 → 1992.38] Now we are in 38, I think.
[1992.38 → 1996.38] Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus,
[1996.38 → 1999.38] the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
[1999.38 → 2003.38] Through him, everyone who believes is set free from every sin,
[2003.38 → 2009.38] a justification you are not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
[2009.38 → 2012.38] This is the word of the Lord.
[2012.38 → 2013.38] Thanks be to God.
[2013.38 → 2017.38] Let's come before God in prayer as we open his word together.
[2017.38 → 2022.38] Heavenly Father, we want to commit this time to you.
[2022.38 → 2028.38] And we pray that you would speak to each of us through your word,
[2028.38 → 2030.38] through this sermon that Paul preached.
[2030.38 → 2038.38] We pray that your spirit would come and make your truth come alive in our hearts today.
[2038.38 → 2041.38] We pray this in Jesus name.
[2041.38 → 2042.38] Amen.
[2042.38 → 2049.38] So, it's kind of cool today, but actually I was kind of anticipating.
[2049.38 → 2052.38] It's going to be a really hot day.
[2052.38 → 2054.38] And it has been hot for the last few days.
[2054.38 → 2058.38] So I thought, well, let's turn our thoughts to Greenland.
[2058.38 → 2061.38] The frigid, cold, icy waters of Greenland.
[2061.38 → 2068.38] So in these waters, these icy cold waters, there are countless icebergs.
[2068.38 → 2071.38] Some of these icebergs are pretty small.
[2071.38 → 2076.38] Some of them are gigantic, like 300 feet tall.
[2076.38 → 2088.38] And one thing you'd notice if you went, and you observed these icebergs is that sometimes the small icebergs are kind of moving in one direction,
[2088.38 → 2093.38] while the massive ones are slowly flowing in another direction.
[2093.38 → 2095.38] Why is this happening?
[2095.38 → 2097.38] Well, the explanation is simple enough.
[2097.38 → 2102.38] The little ones are constantly drifting about by the direction of the wind.
[2102.38 → 2105.38] They get blown kind of here and there.
[2105.38 → 2110.38] But these huge icebergs are carried along by these deep ocean currents.
[2110.38 → 2119.38] Now, moving from the natural world, let's think about the human experience.
[2119.38 → 2131.38] French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a novel in which one of the characters expresses a view of life that seems pretty meaningless and hopeless.
[2131.38 → 2133.38] So I'll put the quote up here.
[2133.38 → 2135.38] This is what this character says.
[2135.38 → 2137.38] Nothing happens while you live.
[2137.38 → 2138.38] The scenery changes.
[2138.38 → 2140.38] People come in and go out.
[2140.38 → 2141.38] That's all.
[2141.38 → 2142.38] There are no beginnings.
[2142.38 → 2147.38] Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason.
[2147.38 → 2153.38] But then this character says something pretty fascinating.
[2153.38 → 2155.38] He says this next.
[2155.38 → 2161.38] That's living, but everything changes when you tell about life.
[2161.38 → 2165.38] You seem to start at the beginning.
[2165.38 → 2171.38] So we can make a distinction between living, kind of our daily lives, and life itself.
[2171.38 → 2177.38] Sometimes our experience of living seems like days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason.
[2177.38 → 2185.38] But when we tell the story of a person's life, we start at the beginning, and there's a sense of purpose.
[2185.38 → 2188.38] There's a sense of direction and meaning.
[2188.38 → 2193.38] Human beings struggle with understanding where is all of this going?
[2193.38 → 2194.38] Right?
[2194.38 → 2195.38] This history of planet Earth.
[2195.38 → 2196.38] Is there a purpose?
[2196.38 → 2198.38] Is there a direction?
[2198.38 → 2201.38] Is there a culmination to history?
[2201.38 → 2207.38] Or is it just merely random movements leading nowhere, shifting here and there?
[2207.38 → 2209.38] Days added on to days?
[2209.38 → 2214.38] Well, in our passage, we find the answer to this question.
[2214.38 → 2215.38] Right?
[2215.38 → 2219.38] So it was a Sabbath day in Antioch and Pistoia.
[2219.38 → 2226.38] Paul and Barnabas, as Jewish men, they made their way on the Sabbath to the synagogue.
[2226.38 → 2229.38] And the worship would have started with the Schema.
[2229.38 → 2232.38] Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord alone.
[2232.38 → 2236.38] Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[2236.38 → 2239.38] And there would have been readings from the law and the prophets.
[2239.38 → 2244.38] And then, recognizing that a visitor was in their midst, and that he was a rabbi, maybe
[2244.38 → 2249.38] they could tell by the way he was dressed, they would have invited the visiting rabbi
[2249.38 → 2250.38] to speak.
[2250.38 → 2255.38] They say, brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.
[2255.38 → 2260.38] And Paul's like, yep, I sure do have a word of exhortation.
[2260.38 → 2264.38] Little do they know what they were getting into.
[2264.38 → 2271.38] So Paul gets up, and he retells the history of God's saving work through the nation of
[2271.38 → 2274.38] Israel from the beginning.
[2274.38 → 2282.38] And as he retells this history, his point is that history is going somewhere.
[2282.38 → 2283.38] There is a purpose.
[2283.38 → 2284.38] There is a plan.
[2284.38 → 2290.38] There is a sovereignly administered story where God is the author.
[2290.38 → 2297.38] And like those gigantic icebergs being carried along by these ocean currents, history is
[2297.38 → 2303.38] being carried along by the deep currents of God's sovereign purposes.
[2303.38 → 2308.38] His unchanging plan to redeem his people.
[2308.38 → 2314.38] And now for everybody in this synagogue in Pistoia, they believe this already.
[2314.38 → 2317.38] They believe that God had a plan.
[2317.38 → 2320.38] And they knew exactly what was going on.
[2320.38 → 2322.38] They knew the history of their ancestors from the beginning.
[2322.38 → 2325.38] And they knew where the story was going.
[2325.38 → 2331.38] To this culmination of the redemption of God's people in the coming messianic kingdom.
[2331.38 → 2341.38] The Messiah, they knew, would come, would restore creation, break the bondage of sin and death, and in the end rule over new heavens and new earth.
[2341.38 → 2350.38] But here Paul comes, and he presents Jesus as the fulfillment.
[2350.38 → 2355.38] Jesus is the Messiah that God promised.
[2355.38 → 2363.38] And Paul, as a skilful communicator, as his orator, he retells the story of Israel.
[2363.38 → 2375.38] And then in the heart of this retelling, we see a God who is providentially moving through history for the purpose of its redemption in Jesus Christ.
[2375.38 → 2389.38] And so what I want us today to notice and to focus on and to recognize in Paul's message that is so powerful is the initiative of God.
[2389.38 → 2391.38] The initiative of God.
[2391.38 → 2398.38] You know, in this passage, it's like 23 times through the whole sermon, it says God chose.
[2398.38 → 2402.38] God led. God gave. God put up with.
[2402.38 → 2407.38] God is the subject of like almost every verb in this entire sermon.
[2407.38 → 2417.38] God graciously initiating, involving himself, present with his people, moving through their history to bring about their Saviour.
[2417.38 → 2428.38] And so this morning in our passage, we see the section I want to look at only, we see seven, seven, seven different things that God did to paint this story of redemption.
[2428.38 → 2430.38] And that's what I want to look at this morning.
[2430.38 → 2435.38] I want to kind of just move slow and just think about the actions, the initiative of God.
[2435.38 → 2440.38] This is God's story, God's plan, God's history.
[2440.38 → 2443.38] So let's go through these together.
[2443.38 → 2445.38] In verse 17, Paul begins.
[2445.38 → 2449.38] Number one, God picked our ancestors.
[2449.38 → 2451.38] It's the first thing that he mentions.
[2451.38 → 2458.38] He says, the God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors.
[2458.38 → 2460.38] Who chose our ancestors?
[2460.38 → 2463.38] God chose them.
[2463.38 → 2470.38] First, he came to Abraham, and he said, I am going to make a great people out of you.
[2470.38 → 2472.38] I am going to be your God.
[2472.38 → 2473.38] You are going to be my people.
[2473.38 → 2479.38] And he made this unconditional covenant with them, with Abraham.
[2479.38 → 2484.38] From there, of course, we have Isaac, who was called the child of promise.
[2484.38 → 2485.38] Right?
[2485.38 → 2491.38] He was called the child of promise because Abraham was promised a land and a great people.
[2491.38 → 2493.38] And so you know the story.
[2493.38 → 2497.38] Abraham, he tried to make it happen himself with Hagar.
[2497.38 → 2501.38] But Ishmael, the son that was born to them, was not the right man.
[2501.38 → 2509.38] God chose Isaac, the son God had promised he would have with his wife Sarah to fulfill his purposes.
[2509.38 → 2511.38] So Abraham and Isaac.
[2511.38 → 2512.38] And from there, we have Jacob.
[2512.38 → 2516.38] God sovereignly chose Jacob, even though Jacob was born second.
[2516.38 → 2520.38] And Paul makes much of this in Romans chapter 9.
[2520.38 → 2523.38] He talks about the fact that Esau and Jacob were twins.
[2523.38 → 2528.38] And before they were even born, God chose Jacob.
[2528.38 → 2531.38] From Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we then have Joseph.
[2531.38 → 2533.38] God chose Joseph.
[2533.38 → 2541.38] God gives him these amazing dreams, then protects him, even when all of his brothers turn against him.
[2541.38 → 2548.38] He then raises him up to be the second in command in Egypt, of all of Egypt.
[2548.38 → 2551.38] God sovereignly chose their ancestors.
[2551.38 → 2565.38] To the point that so much, they so owned this truth, that they were God's chosen people, so significant to them, that they referred to themselves as the chosen people of God.
[2565.38 → 2572.38] The second gracious initiative of God that Paul lists is that God prospered them in Egypt.
[2572.38 → 2574.38] In verse 17, Paul, he goes on.
[2574.38 → 2578.38] He made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt.
[2578.38 → 2580.38] Who prospered them?
[2580.38 → 2582.38] God prospered them.
[2582.38 → 2583.38] Right?
[2583.38 → 2584.38] Right?
[2584.38 → 2585.38] They grew and multiplied.
[2585.38 → 2591.38] You know, often, people growing and multiplying, we see that as kind of pretty ordinary thing.
[2591.38 → 2593.38] It's a normal human experience.
[2593.38 → 2597.38] Yet even in this, God is the one who sovereignly brings it about.
[2597.38 → 2602.38] And he did so greatly with the Jews in Egypt.
[2602.38 → 2605.38] God prospered them in Egypt.
[2605.38 → 2609.38] So God chose their ancestors.
[2609.38 → 2610.38] He prospered them.
[2610.38 → 2611.38] He multiplied them.
[2611.38 → 2614.38] He made them a powerful people in Egypt.
[2614.38 → 2617.38] Number three, this is a big one.
[2617.38 → 2620.38] God purchased them from slavery.
[2620.38 → 2621.38] Right?
[2621.38 → 2622.38] God freed them.
[2622.38 → 2623.38] God redeemed them.
[2623.38 → 2626.38] Again, in verse 17, Paul says,
[2626.38 → 2630.38] With mighty power, he led them out of that country.
[2630.38 → 2632.38] Who did it?
[2632.38 → 2634.38] God did it.
[2634.38 → 2636.38] God saved them.
[2636.38 → 2640.38] They were not in the middle of mounting a resistance movement.
[2640.38 → 2641.38] Right?
[2641.38 → 2643.38] They didn't decide to do this themselves.
[2643.38 → 2645.38] They were enslaved in Egypt.
[2645.38 → 2650.38] The Israelites were under the thumb of the largest superpower on planet Earth of the time.
[2650.38 → 2652.38] It was a hopeless situation.
[2652.38 → 2654.38] They were completely powerless.
[2654.38 → 2658.38] And that's where God loves to work, doesn't he?
[2658.38 → 2659.38] Right?
[2659.38 → 2665.38] He loves to work in our weakness so that his strength is highlighted.
[2665.38 → 2668.38] For the Jews who were enslaved, there was no hope.
[2668.38 → 2670.38] There was nothing they could have done.
[2670.38 → 2671.38] They cried out to God.
[2671.38 → 2673.38] And friends, that's the point of salvation.
[2673.38 → 2675.38] That's the picture of salvation.
[2675.38 → 2677.38] For us, it is hopeless.
[2677.38 → 2680.38] But with God, he redeems us.
[2680.38 → 2686.38] He purchases us out of our bondage and slavery to sin.
[2686.38 → 2688.38] Number four.
[2688.38 → 2692.38] God was patient with them in the wilderness.
[2692.38 → 2694.38] In verse 18, Paul says,
[2694.38 → 2699.38] For about 40 years, he endured their conduct in the wilderness.
[2699.38 → 2700.38] Right?
[2700.38 → 2709.38] You know, I think whenever you read through the Old Testament, you read the stories in the book of Exodus about God saving his people, the more this stands out to you.
[2709.38 → 2713.38] The supernatural patience and love of God to put up with his people.
[2713.38 → 2716.38] Supernatural patience.
[2716.38 → 2718.38] Patience that only God could have.
[2718.38 → 2720.38] And remember the big story.
[2720.38 → 2721.38] They were enslaved.
[2721.38 → 2723.38] God hears their cry.
[2723.38 → 2725.38] He delivers them miraculously.
[2725.38 → 2734.38] He humbles their enemies, the greatest nation of all time, leads them through the Red Sea on dry ground, brings them safely to the other side.
[2734.38 → 2743.38] And their response when they get to the other side, they say, God, why have you brought us here so we can die in the wilderness?
[2743.38 → 2744.38] Right?
[2744.38 → 2746.38] 430 years of slavery.
[2746.38 → 2748.38] And they say, we had better food in Egypt.
[2748.38 → 2749.38] What is this?
[2749.38 → 2750.38] Manna from heaven.
[2750.38 → 2751.38] Right?
[2751.38 → 2753.38] Our pallets want more than that.
[2753.38 → 2758.38] And this complaining, this grumbling, it didn't just happen once.
[2758.38 → 2762.38] It happened over and over and over again.
[2762.38 → 2764.38] God leads them out of Egypt.
[2764.38 → 2765.38] They make a golden calf.
[2765.38 → 2766.38] Right?
[2766.38 → 2767.38] Just constantly.
[2767.38 → 2771.38] And yet, God was patient with them in the wilderness.
[2771.38 → 2772.38] Why?
[2772.38 → 2775.38] Why was he so patient?
[2775.38 → 2780.38] Well, one answer that we see in Scripture is that he did it for his own glory.
[2780.38 → 2781.38] Right?
[2781.38 → 2790.38] In fact, there are a number of times when God basically tells Moses, I'm about ready to wipe this people out and start over.
[2790.38 → 2793.38] And Moses responds, don't do that.
[2793.38 → 2794.38] Why?
[2794.38 → 2797.38] Because your name will be profaned.
[2797.38 → 2798.38] That's why.
[2798.38 → 2799.38] Right?
[2799.38 → 2801.38] The nations around, they will hear of it.
[2801.38 → 2804.38] They will say, look, God can't even save his own people.
[2804.38 → 2805.38] He's not that great.
[2805.38 → 2807.38] His plan is a failure.
[2807.38 → 2814.38] And so even their rebellion will not stop God from fulfilling the promise that he made.
[2814.38 → 2821.38] He made a promise to Abraham and to his descendants, and he is going to fulfill it.
[2821.38 → 2822.38] Right?
[2822.38 → 2826.38] It's not, it shows us salvation is not from us at all.
[2826.38 → 2828.38] God will do it.
[2828.38 → 2830.38] This is an image of salvation.
[2830.38 → 2841.38] It's an image of God's sovereign plan of how he redeems his people, even if it means being patient with the stiff-necked people who are the most ungrateful people that you could ever imagine.
[2841.38 → 2844.38] You know, God's patience continues today.
[2844.38 → 2845.38] Right?
[2845.38 → 2857.38] Verse 18, I found this super encouraging to me personally because God continues to put up with me in the wilderness of my own creating.
[2857.38 → 2866.38] So number five, we see in verse 19, God gave them possession of the land.
[2866.38 → 2875.38] Paul says, and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
[2875.38 → 2876.38] Right?
[2876.38 → 2877.38] Who gave them the land?
[2877.38 → 2879.38] God gave them the land.
[2879.38 → 2889.38] So here, you know, we have these seven nations, and then in Deuteronomy chapter seven, these seven nations, each of them are described as more numerous and mightier than Israel.
[2889.38 → 2892.38] And remember the story of the 12 spies.
[2892.38 → 2897.38] They go into the land to spy it out, to see who's there, they come back with a report.
[2897.38 → 2900.38] They are giants in the land.
[2900.38 → 2905.38] There's no way we can conquer these people.
[2905.38 → 2912.38] So God makes them wander in the wilderness for 40 years until they adjust their attitudes and learn to trust him again.
[2912.38 → 2917.38] But could that stop God's plan to save his people?
[2917.38 → 2918.38] No.
[2918.38 → 2922.38] God will fulfill his promise.
[2922.38 → 2924.38] He will fight for us.
[2924.38 → 2926.38] He will defeat nations.
[2926.38 → 2929.38] And most importantly, friends, he defeated sin.
[2929.38 → 2931.38] He defeated death itself.
[2931.38 → 2933.38] And then notice what it says in verse 20.
[2933.38 → 2936.38] All of this took about 450 years.
[2936.38 → 2938.38] 450 years.
[2938.38 → 2940.38] That is a very long time.
[2940.38 → 2942.38] Why does Paul mention this?
[2942.38 → 2943.38] Yes.
[2943.38 → 2945.38] All this took 450 years.
[2945.38 → 2949.38] I think, again, because God sovereignly, he will redeem his people.
[2949.38 → 2951.38] Even if it takes centuries.
[2951.38 → 2952.38] 450 years.
[2952.38 → 2954.38] He will not give up.
[2954.38 → 2956.38] He will fulfill his promises.
[2956.38 → 2957.38] Right?
[2957.38 → 2961.38] And the apostle Peter says in God's eyes, a day is like a thousand years.
[2961.38 → 2970.38] And God is not slow in keeping his promises, as we understand slowness, but he is not wanting any to perish.
[2970.38 → 2975.38] So God chose their ancestors.
[2975.38 → 2978.38] God prospered them in Egypt.
[2978.38 → 2980.38] God delivered them from slavery.
[2980.38 → 2982.38] God was patient with them.
[2982.38 → 2984.38] God gave them the promised land.
[2984.38 → 2986.38] Now here's number six.
[2986.38 → 2989.38] God appointed leaders for his people.
[2989.38 → 2990.38] Right?
[2990.38 → 2991.38] It says in verse 20.
[2991.38 → 2996.38] After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel, the prophet.
[2996.38 → 2999.38] Then the people asked for a king.
[2999.38 → 3004.38] And he gave them Saul, son of Fish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled 40 years.
[3004.38 → 3007.38] After removing Saul, he made David their king.
[3007.38 → 3009.38] God testified concerning him.
[3009.38 → 3012.38] I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart.
[3012.38 → 3014.38] He will do everything I want him to do.
[3014.38 → 3015.38] Right?
[3015.38 → 3017.38] So God appointed leaders.
[3017.38 → 3018.38] Why?
[3018.38 → 3020.38] To guide his people.
[3020.38 → 3022.38] Because he cared for them.
[3022.38 → 3023.38] To guide them.
[3023.38 → 3026.38] To help them to know and worship God.
[3026.38 → 3027.38] To protect them.
[3027.38 → 3029.38] To rule over them.
[3029.38 → 3033.38] And then Samuel links the period of the judges to that of the kings.
[3033.38 → 3034.38] Right?
[3034.38 → 3037.38] He was the last judge, and he anointed the first king, Saul.
[3037.38 → 3041.38] The people asked for a king like the other nations.
[3041.38 → 3045.38] And so God gave them a king like the other nations.
[3045.38 → 3046.38] He gave them Saul.
[3046.38 → 3048.38] Physically impressive.
[3048.38 → 3050.38] Spiritually weak.
[3050.38 → 3051.38] And self-centred.
[3051.38 → 3057.38] But then God in his graciousness provided a king unlike the other nations.
[3057.38 → 3060.38] He gave them a humble king.
[3060.38 → 3061.38] King David.
[3061.38 → 3063.38] Who would shepherd his people.
[3063.38 → 3066.38] Finally, friends, we come to number seven.
[3066.38 → 3071.38] In the fullness of time, God provided a saviour.
[3071.38 → 3074.38] In verse 23, you know, I love it.
[3074.38 → 3076.38] Paul just jumps straight to Jesus.
[3076.38 → 3079.38] He says, from this man's descendants, in verse 23, right?
[3079.38 → 3080.38] Referring to David.
[3080.38 → 3085.38] God has brought to Israel the saviour Jesus as he promised.
[3085.38 → 3086.38] Right?
[3086.38 → 3092.38] God fulfills his promise to provide a saviour.
[3092.38 → 3094.38] What is a saviour?
[3094.38 → 3099.38] A saviour is somebody who can bring men and women to God.
[3099.38 → 3101.38] And who is that?
[3101.38 → 3102.38] It's Jesus.
[3102.38 → 3103.38] Right?
[3103.38 → 3105.38] Jesus alone brings us to God.
[3105.38 → 3111.38] So then I want us to jump down to verse 38 and 39.
[3111.38 → 3114.38] And here is the heartbeat of the gospel.
[3114.38 → 3115.38] Okay?
[3115.38 → 3118.38] Paul says, therefore, my friends.
[3118.38 → 3119.38] Verse 38.
[3119.38 → 3120.38] It starts with this word, therefore.
[3120.38 → 3125.38] And so as the saying goes, it's important to know what the word therefore is there for.
[3125.38 → 3131.38] The answer, of course, is that Paul is moving from God's sovereign story of redemption.
[3131.38 → 3136.38] Now to a specific application of the good news, the gospel.
[3136.38 → 3140.38] The question is, how does this truth about Jesus affect me?
[3140.38 → 3141.38] Right?
[3141.38 → 3143.38] What does this have to do with my life?
[3143.38 → 3148.38] How should I respond to this story that God is authoring?
[3148.38 → 3154.38] Paul answers, therefore, my friends, through Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed
[3154.38 → 3155.38] to you.
[3155.38 → 3159.38] Through him, everyone who believes is set free from every sin.
[3159.38 → 3164.38] A justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
[3164.38 → 3165.38] Forgiveness of sins.
[3165.38 → 3168.38] Forgiveness of sins.
[3168.38 → 3169.38] Right?
[3169.38 → 3170.38] That is what they needed.
[3170.38 → 3173.38] That was God's plan all along.
[3173.38 → 3178.38] All of this that he was doing that we read so that he might forgive his people.
[3178.38 → 3181.38] And friends, that is what we need as well.
[3181.38 → 3184.38] Why is that a need?
[3184.38 → 3185.38] Well, we see the answer here.
[3185.38 → 3186.38] Because we are not free.
[3186.38 → 3187.38] Because we are not free.
[3187.38 → 3193.38] Like the Israelites enslaved in Egypt, we are held in ongoing bondage.
[3193.38 → 3195.38] We are enslaved.
[3195.38 → 3196.38] We are enslaved to sin.
[3196.38 → 3200.38] We are enslaved to a fallen nature in a fallen kingdom.
[3200.38 → 3210.38] But the son of David, he freed us by setting us free from every sin.
[3210.38 → 3212.38] God's heart for us.
[3212.38 → 3213.38] God's plan.
[3213.38 → 3219.38] His gracious movement throughout human history was to bring about our redemption.
[3219.38 → 3224.38] And Paul uses this word, he uses this word, justification.
[3224.38 → 3225.38] Justification.
[3225.38 → 3226.38] Right?
[3226.38 → 3230.38] That means that we can stand before God as if we had never sinned.
[3230.38 → 3231.38] That is what it means.
[3231.38 → 3237.38] Justification means that we can stand before God as if we had never sinned.
[3237.38 → 3242.38] And this is something that we can never obtain under the law of Moses.
[3242.38 → 3245.38] And this is so important for us to understand.
[3245.38 → 3247.38] The law cannot save us.
[3247.38 → 3248.38] Why not?
[3248.38 → 3251.38] Is the law bad?
[3251.38 → 3252.38] No.
[3252.38 → 3253.38] The law is good.
[3253.38 → 3255.38] The law is perfect.
[3255.38 → 3260.38] The problem is our human inability to keep the law.
[3260.38 → 3261.38] Right?
[3261.38 → 3262.38] Here's the thing.
[3262.38 → 3266.38] The moment that there's a law in front of us, we just want to go and break it.
[3266.38 → 3269.38] If you've had kids, you know, if you've been with kids, you know what this is like.
[3269.38 → 3271.38] You give a law.
[3271.38 → 3272.38] They break it.
[3272.38 → 3273.38] Right?
[3273.38 → 3274.38] That's the temptation.
[3274.38 → 3278.38] When the speed limit says 50, I drive 70.
[3278.38 → 3281.38] My kids are constantly saying, Dad, slow down.
[3281.38 → 3282.38] You're speeding.
[3282.38 → 3283.38] Why are you going so fast?
[3283.38 → 3284.38] Why do you want a speeding ticket?
[3284.38 → 3285.38] I said, I don't know.
[3285.38 → 3287.38] I just want to break the law.
[3287.38 → 3288.38] Right?
[3288.38 → 3289.38] Now, you might not do that.
[3289.38 → 3293.38] Although, I see how some of you drive in the parking lot.
[3293.38 → 3294.38] Okay.
[3294.38 → 3295.38] And that's just an example.
[3295.38 → 3301.38] But we are all constantly, we're finding ourselves doing the things that we shouldn't do.
[3301.38 → 3305.38] We're not doing the things for some reason that we know we ought to do.
[3305.38 → 3311.38] And what this does is just piles up guilt upon guilt upon our lives.
[3311.38 → 3315.38] The law of God was not given to actually save us.
[3315.38 → 3320.38] It was given to reveal our sin and to show us our need for our Saviour.
[3320.38 → 3321.38] Right?
[3321.38 → 3324.38] The law is not like this lifeguard ring.
[3324.38 → 3327.38] You know, those rings you throw out to save someone who is drowning.
[3327.38 → 3328.38] No.
[3328.38 → 3337.38] It is a plumb line from heaven to show us how the righteousness of God, show us the righteousness that God requires.
[3337.38 → 3338.38] The righteousness of God.
[3338.38 → 3339.38] Who he is.
[3339.38 → 3344.38] And how, when we see this, that we don't measure up.
[3344.38 → 3348.38] That's why the law is not a measurement of how bad we are.
[3348.38 → 3351.38] It's a measurement of how good and holy God is.
[3351.38 → 3357.38] And what Paul proclaims, this word of exhortation.
[3357.38 → 3360.38] Do you have any encouragement for us?
[3360.38 → 3361.38] Yes, I do.
[3361.38 → 3364.38] He gives them the gospel.
[3364.38 → 3373.38] This, in the gospel, is that we can be set free simply by accepting Christ's fulfillment of the law for us.
[3373.38 → 3374.38] Right?
[3374.38 → 3377.38] Christ came, he lived a perfect, holy life.
[3377.38 → 3381.38] When that plumb line came, Jesus matched it perfectly.
[3381.38 → 3384.38] He fulfilled the law of God.
[3384.38 → 3389.38] And then he died, he paid the penalty for our sins that we could never pay.
[3389.38 → 3394.38] He rose from the dead so that through faith in him, we could have his life.
[3394.38 → 3404.38] And for Paul, his understanding of God's sovereign story of redemption is of a God who is always present with his people.
[3404.38 → 3407.38] He's always present with his people.
[3407.38 → 3410.38] He's always graciously pursuing them.
[3410.38 → 3412.38] He's forgiving them.
[3412.38 → 3414.38] He's delivering them.
[3414.38 → 3419.38] He actually chastised them because he loves them.
[3419.38 → 3430.38] And this is a God who gave his, the final expression of his redemptive love by giving us Jesus, his son, our saviour.
[3430.38 → 3435.38] And friends, that's why we are here this morning, to worship him.
[3435.38 → 3437.38] Let's pray together.
[3437.38 → 3460.38] Heavenly Father, we pray that you would give us today a greater sense of awe, a greater sense of worship for you, for who you are, as we see your sovereign hand bringing about this glorious picture of salvation.
[3460.38 → 3464.38] God, you did it.
[3464.38 → 3477.38] And we ask, Lord, that your gospel of grace in Christ, this freedom from all of our sins, of being able to stand before God as if we had never sinned, that this would be such good news to us.
[3477.38 → 3483.38] Lord, give us hearts to always receive and to marvel at your grace.
[3483.38 → 3488.38] And Lord, give us hearts also, as you have pursued us by your grace.
[3488.38 → 3494.38] Help us, Lord, to pursue and proclaim your gospel to others around us.
[3494.38 → 3504.38] So like the apostle Paul, like Barnabas, like others, Lord, that we would go forth in obedience to the Holy Spirit, proclaiming the good news.
[3504.38 → 3505.38] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3505.38 → 3506.38] Amen.
[3506.38 → 3511.38] Let's stand and let's sing our song of response together.
[3511.38 → 3513.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3541.38 → 3542.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3542.38 → 3543.38] Amen.
[3543.38 → 3544.38] Amen.
[3544.38 → 3545.38] Let's sing our song.
[3545.38 → 3546.38] Let's sing amen.
[3546.38 → 3548.38] Let's pray.
[3548.38 → 3549.38] Let's stand and let's dance.
[3549.38 → 3550.88] Let's sing our song together.
[3550.88 → 3551.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3551.38 → 3553.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3553.38 → 3554.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3554.38 → 3555.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3555.38 → 3556.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3556.38 → 3561.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3561.38 → 3564.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3564.38 → 3566.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3566.38 → 3568.38] Let's sing your song together.
[3568.38 → 3569.38] Let's sing our song together.
[3569.38 → 3574.02] shadows of thy soul
[3574.02 → 3577.38] the world is finished
[3577.38 → 3580.02] the end is written
[3580.02 → 3583.08] Jesus Christ
[3583.08 → 3586.84] my living hope
[3586.84 → 3593.38] who could imagine
[3593.38 → 3596.18] some great mercy
[3596.18 → 3599.08] what heartless love
[3599.08 → 3602.84] such outless grace
[3602.84 → 3606.02] the God of ages
[3606.02 → 3608.68] slipped down from glory
[3608.68 → 3611.42] to earn my sin
[3611.42 → 3614.88] and bear my shame
[3614.88 → 3617.80] the cross has spoken
[3617.80 → 3620.94] I am forgiven
[3620.94 → 3625.94] the King of kings calls me near
[3626.18 → 3630.24] his own beautiful Saviour
[3630.24 → 3633.42] I'm yours forever
[3633.42 → 3639.58] Jesus Christ my living hope
[3639.58 → 3643.64] Alleluia
[3643.64 → 3646.98] praise the Lord who set me free
[3646.98 → 3649.98] Alleluia
[3649.98 → 3653.18] death has lost its grip on me
[3653.18 → 3655.64] you have broken every chain
[3655.64 → 3658.82] there's salvation in your name
[3658.82 → 3666.02] Jesus Christ my living hope
[3666.02 → 3666.38] Jesus Christ my living hope
[3666.38 → 3667.48] Jesus Christ my living hope
[3667.48 → 3670.58] And came the morning
[3670.58 → 3673.56] that stood the promise
[3673.56 → 3680.40] Your groaning body began to breathe
[3680.40 → 3686.36] Out of the silence the roaring lion
[3686.36 → 3692.20] Declared the grave as a plague on me
[3692.20 → 3699.06] Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[3699.06 → 3704.68] Your groaning body began to breathe
[3704.68 → 3710.56] Out of the silence the roaring lion
[3710.56 → 3716.82] Declared the grave as a plague on me
[3716.82 → 3722.38] Jesus, yours is the Lord of glory
[3722.38 → 3732.70] Hallelujah, praise the one who sets me free
[3732.70 → 3738.38] Hallelujah, death has lost its new heart
[3738.38 → 3741.84] You have broken every chain
[3741.84 → 3744.76] There's no wish to leave your name
[3744.76 → 3749.38] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[3749.38 → 3756.88] Hallelujah, praise the one who sets me free
[3756.88 → 3762.50] Hallelujah, death has lost its new heart
[3762.50 → 3765.90] You have broken every chain
[3765.90 → 3768.88] There's no wish to leave your name
[3768.88 → 3773.80] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[3773.80 → 3780.46] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[3780.46 → 3786.80] Welcome to our, my living hope
[3786.80 → 3790.64] You may be seated
[3790.64 → 3798.42] At this time we have the opportunity
[3798.42 → 3800.90] To share in a ministry
[3800.90 → 3805.92] At the campus ministry for UBC Okanagan
[3805.92 → 3809.60] Todd Stat ham is a missionary of the CRC
[3809.60 → 3813.08] Serving that campus as a university chaplain
[3813.08 → 3815.40] You may remember that he was here
[3815.40 → 3817.44] I think about a month ago
[3817.44 → 3819.86] He follows the spirits leading
[3819.86 → 3822.30] Helping undergrads, international students
[3822.30 → 3824.56] And professors grow in faith in Christ
[3824.56 → 3826.30] He seeks to be a catalyst
[3826.30 → 3828.12] For thoughtful Christian engagement
[3828.12 → 3831.58] Within the university culture
[3831.58 → 3835.62] So please pray for this mission
[3835.62 → 3837.70] And give generously
[3837.70 → 3851.12] Thank you
[3851.12 → 3881.10] Thank you.
[3881.12 → 3911.10] Thank you.
[3911.12 → 3941.10] Thank you.
[3941.12 → 3971.10] Thank you.
[3971.12 → 3973.12] Thank you.
[4001.62 → 4007.90] Lord of all creation, we have spoken and sung of your greatness, your forgiveness, your saving grace.
[4008.66 → 4014.10] You hear us when we call to you, and you know our requests even before they leave our lips.
[4014.10 → 4021.74] Still as our Father, you desire to draw us close and listen to our deepest longings.
[4021.74 → 4025.48] And so this morning, we lay our hearts bare before you.
[4025.48 → 4037.32] We pray for our hurting world, your creation that you love so deeply, marred by sin, through broken relationships, violence, and apathy.
[4037.32 → 4046.20] We pray that you will forgive and heal our land, which was founded on faith in you but has gone so far in the opposite direction.
[4047.16 → 4054.84] Make us beacons of your love, so our beloved nation may discover again the origin of true hope, freedom, and peace.
[4054.84 → 4061.22] We can only fall on your grace as we lay this before you, for we know you are present with us.
[4062.22 → 4064.98] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4064.98 → 4070.52] We ask your care over this province and the many fires that are burning.
[4071.46 → 4078.92] We pray for rain to douse the flames and ask protection over those who are fighting to save lives and property.
[4079.62 → 4083.88] We pray for the family of the young woman who died this week doing so.
[4083.88 → 4091.34] In the same way, provide strength for those working in health care, in policing, and as first responders.
[4092.08 → 4093.40] We thank you for them.
[4094.04 → 4097.96] They have a hard job, and we pray for their physical and emotional health.
[4098.82 → 4101.52] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4102.80 → 4106.16] There are so many areas on this earth where hope seems dim.
[4106.92 → 4113.78] We think of Ukraine, of Iran, of several African countries, all areas of conflict, and many more.
[4114.68 → 4117.82] Bring your light, we pray, through your body, the church.
[4118.90 → 4125.26] We remember those who are being persecuted for their faith, no matter where or how dangerous their plight.
[4126.14 → 4129.46] Give them courage and strength to hold fast.
[4130.16 → 4135.96] Grow your church even through these trials as you have done so often in the past.
[4136.88 → 4141.42] May your kingdom and the glory of your name be expanded wherever your church meets.
[4141.42 → 4145.10] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4145.10 → 4150.02] We pray for those who bring the gospel to the far reaches of the world.
[4150.60 → 4152.18] Inspire them by your spirit.
[4152.40 → 4154.80] Give them words to speak when they feel inadequate.
[4155.82 → 4157.40] Strength when they feel weak.
[4157.56 → 4159.58] And faith when they feel hopeless.
[4160.40 → 4163.06] Give them encouragement and joy in their work.
[4163.06 → 4169.16] We thank you for the calling of Todd Stat ham to UBC Okanagan University.
[4170.06 → 4171.52] Bring fruit to his labours.
[4172.12 → 4175.94] Thank you that we are able to minister alongside him through the gifts we bring.
[4176.78 → 4179.54] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4179.54 → 4186.78] We bring to you, Lord, those of our own faith community.
[4187.62 → 4192.20] We have reason to give you thanks for the joining in marriage of Kim and Brendan last week.
[4192.80 → 4197.36] Will you give them a joyful life together with you at the centre of their relationship?
[4198.50 → 4203.08] We praise and thank you for your healing hand on Jordan and that he is doing so well.
[4203.08 → 4209.20] We also remember those who are struggling with physical health, cancer and other illnesses.
[4210.06 → 4215.86] Lord, today we pray fervently for Amy, who has had a serious setback in her journey with cancer.
[4216.42 → 4222.02] We ask for healing as we have done before, since we know that nothing is out of your ability to do.
[4223.22 → 4229.46] Enfold WIM and their children, also Jake and Marianne and other family members and friends who walk this journey with them.
[4229.46 → 4234.52] Give them certainty of your presence and your peace that passes all understanding.
[4235.94 → 4244.08] Lord, we bring before you all in our fellowship who suffer with physical, emotional, spiritual or relational brokenness.
[4244.78 → 4252.80] We pray for all these brothers and sisters today, those mentioned in our bulletin every week and those we are not aware of, who suffer privately.
[4253.68 → 4258.82] Give hope and health to them and the loved ones who provide support and care.
[4260.00 → 4264.58] Restore us, Lord, for we all have wounds that need the touch of your healing hand.
[4265.54 → 4269.30] Give comfort to those who mourn the recent loss of loved ones.
[4269.74 → 4274.52] We think especially of Pat as she mourns the loss of her husband and best friend, Peter.
[4275.32 → 4279.34] We thank you for Peter's life and his impact on this church and community.
[4279.90 → 4283.04] And ask your comfort for friends and extended family as well.
[4283.84 → 4287.06] Give Pat all she needs in the days ahead as we support her.
[4287.06 → 4293.22] Provide comfort for Joe and Shirley and family as they mourn the loss of a sister and an aunt.
[4293.84 → 4298.76] We look forward to the day when all will be made new, and we will never shed another tear.
[4299.64 → 4302.52] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4302.52 → 4309.18] Thank you for this fellowship of believers, for Pastor Jason, Pastor Nancy, and our council.
[4309.76 → 4312.80] Will you enrich their work and grow your kingdom here?
[4313.34 → 4318.72] We thank you for new council members to lead us and for Edgar's installation as a deacon this morning.
[4319.54 → 4323.94] Give willingness and joy to all those who serve in various ministries here.
[4324.94 → 4327.62] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4327.62 → 4332.92] Go with us now that we may seek your kingdom first,
[4333.48 → 4341.02] that your fire may burn within us as we live our lives to seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with you.
[4341.60 → 4345.34] We pray this in the powerful name of Jesus Christ, our King.
[4346.02 → 4346.36] Amen.
[4346.36 → 4346.48] Amen.
[4357.62 → 4360.26] Friends, please rise.
[4363.48 → 4368.26] And again, as we conclude our time of worship, please do join us for time of fellowship.
[4369.22 → 4374.82] And now we go out with God's good word, his benediction over us.
[4374.88 → 4379.64] And I invite you to hold out your hands, don't be shy, as just a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4380.08 → 4384.20] Brothers and sisters, I just forgot it.
[4384.90 → 4385.34] Hold on.
[4385.34 → 4389.00] May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[4389.62 → 4393.36] May the Lord turn his face toward you and be gracious to you.
[4393.90 → 4397.56] May the Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[4398.00 → 4398.24] Amen.
[4398.24 → 4398.32] Amen.
[4415.34 → 4428.34] We will glorify the King of kings.
[4428.34 → 4433.18] We will glorify the Lamb.
[4433.62 → 4438.52] We will glorify the Lord of lords.
[4438.86 → 4443.12] Who is the great I am.
[4443.12 → 4448.36] Lord of all who reigns in majesty.
[4448.36 → 4453.50] We will bow before his call.
[4453.50 → 4458.22] We will worship him in righteousness.
[4459.00 → 4462.52] We will worship him alone.
[4462.52 → 4466.74] He is Lord of heaven.
[4466.74 → 4466.90] He is Lord of heaven.
[4466.90 → 4468.68] Lord of earth.
[4468.68 → 4473.00] He is Lord of all who reign.
[4473.00 → 4478.40] He is Lord of all the universe.
[4478.40 → 4483.26] All bring to him.
[4483.26 → 4485.92] All bring to him.
[4485.92 → 4488.66] We will glorify the King of kings.
[4488.74 → 4493.06] Alleluia to the Lamb.
[4493.06 → 4498.50] Alleluia to the Lord of lords.
[4498.86 → 4504.00] Who will live so great I am.
