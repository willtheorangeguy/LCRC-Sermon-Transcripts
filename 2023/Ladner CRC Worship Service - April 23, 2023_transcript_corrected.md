[278.72 → 280.72] Good morning.
[280.72 → 282.72] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[282.72 → 288.72] My name is Jason True and I will be helping lead us through the worship this morning.
[288.72 → 292.72] I have a few announcements before we get started.
[292.72 → 299.72] First thing is this evening we are having a prayer meeting, an evening of prayer.
[299.72 → 302.72] It will be at 7 p.m. tonight in the Fireside Room.
[302.72 → 308.72] And we will pray together, we will have a few songs, and we will share some desserts.
[308.72 → 311.72] So which of those three is your favourite?
[311.72 → 316.72] Whatever motivates you to come out, dessert, prayer, or singing, there will be no judgment.
[316.72 → 321.72] But 7 o'clock, come on out, and we will pray together as a church.
[321.72 → 326.72] Also, our adult Sunday school class cross-training is ongoing these few weeks.
[326.72 → 330.72] You can join us any time that you would like to jump in.
[330.72 → 335.72] We are planning a soup and bun lunch for the second Sunday in May.
[335.72 → 342.72] So I ask you to please consider bringing a pot of your famous soup or buns.
[342.72 → 347.72] And you can sign up on the foyer table to bring something.
[347.72 → 355.72] We will be having a membership class coming up, which will run for three Saturday mornings in May.
[355.72 → 361.72] So it's three sessions, about an hour each time, where we talk about what it is to be a Christian,
[361.72 → 364.72] what it is to become part of a local church.
[364.72 → 371.72] And after you take these classes, you can register to become a member of their church.
[371.72 → 378.72] So maybe you've been coming for a long time even, but if you have not officially become a member, you are not a member.
[378.72 → 380.72] We want you to become a member.
[380.72 → 381.72] So please do.
[381.72 → 385.72] If you're not a member, you can consider joining the class.
[385.72 → 398.72] One announcement that is not in your bulletin is that there is a memorial service for Pastor Henry Newman on this coming Wednesday, April 29th.
[398.72 → 401.72] It is at 1 p.m. at New West CRC.
[401.72 → 409.72] And I heard Henry speak at the church I served at previously.
[409.72 → 411.72] He preached for us a time or two.
[411.72 → 415.72] He was a very warm man and always greeted me.
[415.72 → 418.72] So his memorial service is this Saturday.
[418.72 → 426.72] Lastly, a lot of announcements, but lastly, we are considering our basic skills camp for the summer.
[426.72 → 430.72] And it's already the end of April, and we need to get moving on it.
[430.72 → 445.72] But we want to, before committing 100%, see if there is enough energy, time, volunteers in our church to help us put this camp on.
[445.72 → 453.72] And so we are looking for people, maybe at least one or two more people to join Marcy and myself in being part of the organizing committee.
[453.72 → 460.72] And we also need to make sure we have five skills that we can offer to run the camp.
[460.72 → 465.72] So please do consider whether you're able to join the organizing committee.
[465.72 → 469.72] And if you have a skill that you can help teach the kids during the camp.
[469.72 → 473.72] So please come talk to myself or Marcy about that.
[473.72 → 475.72] Okay.
[475.72 → 480.72] So this morning, let's prepare our hearts for worship.
[480.72 → 494.72] And as we come to this time of worship, we do something a little bit different is I want to give you some time, some space to prepare your hearts this morning as we come before the Lord in worship.
[494.72 → 499.72] So hear God's word to us from Psalm 46 verse 10.
[499.72 → 503.72] Be still and know that I am God.
[503.72 → 506.72] I will be exalted among the nations.
[506.72 → 509.72] I will be exalted in the earth.
[509.72 → 510.72] Amen.
[510.72 → 531.72] I want to invite you now to take a moment of silent preparation for worship.
[531.72 → 536.72] So brothers and sisters, it is still the season of Easter.
[536.72 → 539.72] And we are people of the resurrected Christ.
[539.72 → 546.72] He has overcome our sin and our misery, and he has destroyed the last enemy, which is death itself.
[546.72 → 553.72] And as we come each Sunday, you know, some of us come with our hands and our hearts full.
[553.72 → 554.72] We feel full.
[554.72 → 555.72] We feel full.
[555.72 → 563.72] Others of us come on Sundays feeling that our hands and our hearts are empty.
[563.72 → 578.72] But by the very act of coming to worship today, we are saying that we believe or at least we think it may be true that life is actually not ultimately dependent on what we can find and what we can hold in this world.
[578.72 → 588.72] But that life is found in the one who rose from the grave and rose in glory.
[588.72 → 591.72] He is the one that we worship this morning.
[591.72 → 602.72] So I want to invite you now to stand and join me in our call to worship this morning from Ephesians chapter one, verses three to six.
[602.72 → 612.72] Praise be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[612.72 → 621.72] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[621.72 → 627.72] In love, he predestined us for adoption to son ship through Jesus Christ.
[627.72 → 634.72] In accordance with his pleasure and will to the praise of his glorious grace.
[634.72 → 637.72] Remain standing, and we'll sing our first song this morning.
[637.72 → 639.72] I will sing of my redeemer.
[639.72 → 656.72] I will sing of my redeemer.
[656.72 → 661.72] I will sing of my redeemer.
[661.72 → 666.72] And his wondrous love to me.
[666.72 → 673.72] Of the cruel cross he suffered.
[673.72 → 679.72] From the curse to set me free.
[679.72 → 686.72] Sing, O sing of my redeemer.
[686.72 → 696.72] With his blood he purges me.
[696.72 → 702.72] On the cross he sealed my pardon.
[702.72 → 714.72] Paid the dead and made me free.
[714.72 → 720.72] I will tell the wondrous story.
[720.72 → 727.72] How I lost his estate to save.
[727.72 → 733.72] In his boundless love and mercy.
[733.72 → 739.72] Either else we begin.
[739.72 → 748.72] Sing, O sing of my redeemer.
[748.72 → 749.72] With his blood he purchased me.
[749.72 → 755.72] With his blood he purchased me.
[755.72 → 765.72] On the cross he sealed my pardon.
[765.72 → 774.72] Paid the dead and made me free.
[774.72 → 780.72] I will sing of my redeemer.
[780.72 → 787.72] And his heavenly love to me.
[787.72 → 793.72] He from death to life has brought me.
[793.72 → 799.72] Son of God with him to be.
[799.72 → 802.72] Son of God with him to be.
[802.72 → 804.72] Son of God with him to be.
[804.72 → 806.72] Then the will sleep.
[806.72 → 808.72] And his heavenly love to me.
[808.72 → 809.72] May of him to be...
[809.72 → 814.72] All he regrets me.
[814.72 → 822.00] Purchase me on the cross.
[822.00 → 825.30] Be sealed like powder.
[827.14 → 833.64] Paid the debt and made me free.
[833.64 → 845.82] Please remain standing and join me as we adore our Lord in prayer.
[847.04 → 858.26] Our Lord, our God, you reveal your power and your beauty and your kindness to us day after day, in all times and in all seasons.
[859.06 → 863.36] And we see it so clearly now as the world comes to life again in spring.
[863.84 → 875.54] We see your beauty and goodness in the blossoming trees and flowers, the singing birds, the early rising sun, and rain that waters the earth.
[876.30 → 882.02] Even at night, Lord, your glory is not hidden, for you have set the stars in their place.
[882.62 → 884.62] How great you are, O Lord.
[886.10 → 891.24] And Heavenly Father, we praise you for your boundless love shown to us through Christ our Lord.
[891.24 → 897.26] You have shown us the depth of your mercy and forgiveness in your only-begotten Son.
[898.26 → 904.60] For the countless times we have failed to give you the glory due your name and to look to you for life and love,
[905.20 → 910.24] you willingly bled and died to redeem us and to reconcile us to yourself.
[911.02 → 913.54] All praise, glory, and honour belong to you, O God,
[914.00 → 918.32] who together with the Son and the Spirit are one God, both now and forever.
[918.32 → 919.52] Amen.
[921.12 → 926.22] Our greeting this morning comes to us from 2 Corinthians 1, chapter 1, verse 2.
[926.84 → 933.00] Grace and peace to you from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[933.82 → 936.80] As the Father has greeted us, he's called us to worship him,
[937.20 → 939.86] I want to invite you to turn and greet those around you,
[939.94 → 942.18] especially someone maybe you don't know or haven't seen.
[942.18 → 944.38] I'll extend the peace of Christ to them.
[944.38 → 944.58] Amen.
[944.58 → 945.18] Amen.
[972.18 → 985.66] Who has helped thee wash LOUD TU de be like and to make my wife rich in our hearts?

[1003.04 → 1008.60] Kings and nations tremble at His voice.
[1009.14 → 1014.56] All creation rises to rejoice.
[1014.56 → 1023.94] Behold our God seated on His throne.
[1023.94 → 1028.44] Come let us adore Him.

[1120.06 → 1127.56] Jesus Saviour risen now to reign.
[1127.56 → 1130.54] Heal well other King.
[1130.62 → 1133.06] God eternal, humble to the grave.
[1133.06 → 1135.10] People will broker.
[1135.10 → 1136.70] Come let us adore Him.
[1136.70 → 1140.06] Behold our King.
[1140.06 → 1157.26] Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him.
[1157.26 → 1160.06] Please be seated.
[1170.06 → 1190.06] Longing for life, we made in darkness.
[1190.06 → 1196.06] Longing for truth, we turn to You.
[1196.06 → 1209.06] Make us Your own, Your holy people, light for the world to see.
[1209.06 → 1222.06] Christ be our light, shine in our hearts, shine through the darkness.
[1222.06 → 1235.06] Christ be our light, shine in Your church, gather today.
[1235.06 → 1241.06] Longing for peace, our world is troubled.
[1241.06 → 1247.06] Longing for hope, much despair.
[1247.06 → 1254.06] Your word of hope, has power to save us.
[1254.06 → 1260.06] Make us Your living voice.
[1260.06 → 1273.06] Christ be our light, shine in Your church, gather today.
[1273.06 → 1286.06] Christ be our light, shine in Your church, gather today.

[1312.06 → 1325.06] Christ be our light, shine in Your church, gather today.
[1325.06 → 1348.06] Christ be our light, shine in Your church, gather today.
[1348.06 → 1352.06] So we come now to our time of confession.
[1352.06 → 1356.06] We will hear this call to confession first from the prophet Isaiah.
[1356.06 → 1362.06] Then I will invite you to have a time for silent confession in prayer.
[1362.06 → 1365.06] And so, but first we do remember this.
[1365.06 → 1375.06] Let us remember that in confession that we are reminded of our deep and abiding need for our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1375.06 → 1381.06] But also we are reminded of His abounding love and mercy for us.
[1381.06 → 1385.06] So first hear this invitation to confession.
[1385.06 → 1386.06] I have made you.
[1386.06 → 1387.06] I have made you.
[1387.06 → 1388.06] You are my servant.
[1388.06 → 1391.06] Israel, I will not forget you.
[1391.06 → 1398.06] I have swept away your offences like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist.
[1398.06 → 1403.06] Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
[1403.06 → 1410.06] So, Lord, hear our silent confessions before you now.
[1410.06 → 1427.60] I will bear to the
[1427.60 → 1430.06] Your kingdom ever again the other.
[1430.06 → 1433.06] And I am so sorry to have you.
[1433.06 → 1435.06] I am so diagnosed with one,
[1435.06 → 1437.98] То because we should have done some of those
[1437.98 → 1445.48] Almighty God, to whom all hearts are open,
[1446.34 → 1449.24] all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid,
[1450.18 → 1451.80] cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
[1451.80 → 1454.70] by the work and power of your Holy Spirit,
[1454.70 → 1457.10] that we may perfectly love you
[1457.10 → 1460.14] and worthily magnify your holy name,
[1460.80 → 1462.30] through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1463.06 → 1463.50] Amen.
[1465.20 → 1466.56] So brothers and sisters,
[1466.56 → 1469.18] after repenting of sin and returning to God,
[1469.22 → 1470.26] as he calls us to,
[1470.94 → 1475.26] we now look to Jesus, and we receive his pardon.
[1476.26 → 1480.70] So the next verse in Isaiah that we read says this,
[1481.70 → 1483.80] Sing for joy, you heavens,
[1484.32 → 1485.90] for the Lord has done this.
[1486.24 → 1488.38] Shout aloud, you earth beneath.
[1489.70 → 1491.92] Burst into song, you mountains,
[1492.80 → 1495.24] you forest and all your trees,
[1495.24 → 1497.80] for the Lord has redeemed Jacob.
[1498.58 → 1501.54] He displays his glory in Israel.
[1502.34 → 1505.90] May almighty God, who sent his son into the world to save sinners,
[1506.60 → 1509.78] assure you by his pardon and grant you peace.
[1510.40 → 1510.72] Amen.
[1511.56 → 1512.34] Let's stand.
[1512.72 → 1514.62] Let's sing our next song in response.
[1514.70 → 1515.46] My hope is built.
[1515.72 → 1516.40] Nope, not that one.
[1516.62 → 1517.84] Before the throne of God above.
[1518.10 → 1518.96] Let's stand and sing.
[1518.96 → 1545.88] Before the throne of God above.
[1545.88 → 1551.12] I have a strong and perfect peace.
[1551.12 → 1556.42] A great high priest whose name is love.
[1556.94 → 1561.50] Whoever lives and pleads for me.
[1561.50 → 1567.56] My name is graven on his hands.
[1567.56 → 1572.78] My name is written on his heart.
[1573.18 → 1578.12] I know that one in heaven stands.
[1578.66 → 1582.50] No time can bid me then depart.
[1582.50 → 1595.88] When Satan sends me to despair.
[1595.88 → 1601.68] And tells me of the guilt within.
[1601.68 → 1607.06] Upward I look and see him there.
[1607.06 → 1612.68] Who made an end of all my sin.
[1613.12 → 1618.52] Because the sinless Saviour died.
[1619.02 → 1623.86] My sinful soul is counted free.
[1623.86 → 1629.10] From all the just is satisfied.
[1629.82 → 1634.30] To look of him and pardon me.
[1634.30 → 1640.30] To look of him and pardon me.
[1640.30 → 1645.30] He may hold him there.
[1645.30 → 1661.44] He may hold him there.
[1661.44 → 1664.18] The risen Lamb.
[1664.18 → 1668.54] My perfect spotless righteousness.
[1668.54 → 1674.54] The great unchangeable will I am.
[1674.54 → 1679.54] The King, the glory, and the priest.
[1679.54 → 1682.54] The great unchanging mercies.
[1682.54 → 1683.54] Luke King, the Themeninie Jesus.
[1683.54 → 1685.54] Yeah.
[1685.54 → 1688.54] The king, the king, and the body.
[1688.54 → 1692.40] Is the Saviour, and the Matting.
[1692.40 → 1694.54] What does the King suit mean?
[1694.54 → 1697.50] The Prince William, Alex, and the body.
[1697.50 → 1702.54] If the poor, the ins TAPI message of sense against him,
[1702.54 → 1710.14] With Christ, Christ, Saviour, and my God.
[1723.14 → 1726.32] Yes, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1727.44 → 1729.64] Ryan, can you turn me up just a little bit?
[1730.88 → 1731.30] Thanks.
[1732.54 → 1750.46] All right.
[1750.86 → 1752.66] Just giving everyone a minute to head out.
[1754.38 → 1755.60] Where did everyone go?
[1756.82 → 1757.56] Just kidding.
[1758.56 → 1761.40] So today we are going to begin a new sermon series.
[1761.40 → 1772.80] Now, typically our sermon series will study a book of the Bible or maybe a particular section or passage of scripture.
[1773.70 → 1780.64] Other times, it's helpful to orient a sermon series around a theme or a topic that is addressed in the Bible.
[1781.14 → 1784.86] And then we will look at a variety of different texts.
[1784.86 → 1788.28] And we've done both over the last several years.
[1789.08 → 1795.18] But whether we look at a book of the Bible or whether we look at a theme, we go to the scriptures to teach us.
[1795.78 → 1799.44] And we do that because we believe the Bible is God's word.
[1799.44 → 1803.58] And that part of what it means to live the Christian life is to learn this book.
[1804.22 → 1811.36] To learn its stories, its rhythms, its themes, its concerns.
[1812.04 → 1817.48] And certainly to learn the larger point, which is about the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1817.72 → 1819.66] And then to order our lives around that.
[1819.88 → 1821.52] That's what the Christian life is all about.
[1821.52 → 1828.32] So now for the next six weeks, we're going to be doing this topical or thematic approach.
[1828.56 → 1832.60] And we're going to be doing a series called A Vision for Renewal.
[1833.08 → 1834.34] A Vision for Renewal.
[1834.66 → 1836.22] And here's why we're going to do this.
[1837.10 → 1843.20] At our last congregational meeting back at the end of February, we presented a new vision statement for our church.
[1843.20 → 1848.78] And this is something that a team had worked on during COVID.
[1849.04 → 1853.32] And we presented a council, and we had talked about it through our newsletter.
[1853.68 → 1856.84] But we were kind of waiting for things to kind of get back to normal.
[1857.74 → 1860.14] And anyway, things take longer sometimes than you think they will.
[1860.92 → 1865.26] But last February, we presented this new vision statement.
[1865.26 → 1874.04] And our goal was to articulate a common sense of what we are doing together as a church.
[1874.14 → 1874.54] What is it?
[1875.68 → 1876.78] What's the church for?
[1877.52 → 1880.40] What does it mean to, you know, live out the Christian life?
[1880.44 → 1881.58] What does it mean to do that together?
[1881.68 → 1886.72] These are just kind of basic questions that a vision statement can help us focus on.
[1887.54 → 1889.88] So what is our vision statement as a church?
[1891.82 → 1892.36] Ta-da.
[1892.86 → 1893.16] Okay.
[1893.50 → 1894.08] Here it is.
[1894.08 → 1901.50] Our vision statement as a church family is that we are called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1902.34 → 1903.04] Say it with me.
[1903.90 → 1908.28] Called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1909.04 → 1914.04] So what I want to do is talk about this vision statement by way of a sermon series.
[1914.68 → 1920.50] And my hope for this series is to answer a few questions like, what exactly does this mean?
[1921.20 → 1921.32] Right?
[1921.32 → 1926.30] What does it mean that we are called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ?
[1927.02 → 1930.62] What implications do that have for us as a church?
[1930.62 → 1935.30] What will it look like for us to live this out together as a church?
[1935.30 → 1940.36] That's what I hope to talk about over the next few weeks.
[1941.00 → 1947.38] And what I'd love to do today is read a passage of scripture that has really informed in many ways this vision statement.
[1947.38 → 1951.54] And that is Colossians chapter 1 verses 15 to 23.
[1952.18 → 1955.12] I want you to have the Bible, the passage open in front of you.
[1955.18 → 1956.34] So please get out your Bibles.
[1956.46 → 1959.36] It's on page 875 in your pew Bible.
[1959.80 → 1960.32] 875.
[1963.12 → 1965.24] Colossians 1, 15 to 23.
[1965.88 → 1968.86] Have it in front of you so that we can follow it along together.
[1968.86 → 1971.42] I will be referring to the passage quite a bit.
[1973.28 → 1979.58] So this is from the letter of Paul to the church that is in Colossae.
[1980.42 → 1984.80] And it is one of the most glorious pictures of Jesus and of the church in the whole Bible.
[1984.94 → 1989.70] So again, it's Colossians chapter 1, 15 to 23, page 875.
[1989.70 → 1997.06] So this is God's word.
[1998.74 → 1999.84] And it is true.
[2000.70 → 2002.82] And he gives it to us because he loves us.
[2003.52 → 2004.48] So hear God's word.
[2005.76 → 2010.82] The sun is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
[2011.60 → 2016.70] For in him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[2016.70 → 2020.50] whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[2021.00 → 2024.68] All things have been created through him and for him.
[2025.10 → 2029.78] He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[2030.90 → 2033.18] And he is the head of the body, the church.
[2033.76 → 2036.64] He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead.
[2036.92 → 2040.02] So that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[2040.70 → 2045.00] For God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him.
[2045.00 → 2052.00] And through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,
[2052.44 → 2055.10] by making peace through his bloodshed on the cross.
[2055.72 → 2061.00] Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behaviour.
[2061.66 → 2068.98] But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight,
[2069.46 → 2072.86] without blemish and free from accusation.
[2072.86 → 2080.62] If you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out to you in the gospel.
[2081.22 → 2086.56] This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,
[2087.14 → 2090.26] and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
[2090.26 → 2094.12] This is the word of the Lord.
[2095.62 → 2096.64] Let's pray together.
[2097.54 → 2104.16] Our Father, we thank you for giving us your word, which is both inspired and given by your Holy Spirit.
[2104.16 → 2114.50] And we pray now that you would fill me, that you would fill all of us in our weakness with your Holy Spirit.
[2115.38 → 2121.86] That we would not only hear your word and understand it today, but that we would respond to it with obedience and love.
[2122.64 → 2124.48] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2124.48 → 2124.60] Amen.
[2125.94 → 2134.42] So last summer, our family, for our family vacation, we got to spend a week at Gary Rosema's cabin on Main Island.
[2135.14 → 2142.12] And one of the things I love about going to Vancouver Island and going to the islands in general is to ride on the ferry.
[2142.98 → 2144.98] Now, sometimes when I think of that, I feel like I'm a kid.
[2145.14 → 2146.18] My kids love riding in the family.
[2146.60 → 2149.30] It's still novelty to me, and I love riding on the ferry.
[2149.30 → 2156.18] Now, when you ride on the ferry, as I'm sure many of you have done, you could do one of two things.
[2156.54 → 2157.58] You could sit inside.
[2158.34 → 2160.64] And if you sit inside, it's comfortable.
[2161.28 → 2164.30] You're out of the wind, and it's nice and warm.
[2165.00 → 2174.64] Or you could go out and stand at the very front of the ferry on the upper deck with the cold wind blasting in your face and whipping your hair around.
[2174.64 → 2179.66] Some people have that problem.
[2181.32 → 2183.12] And that's what we chose to do.
[2183.92 → 2186.02] So just a photo from our trip.
[2186.90 → 2187.10] All right.
[2187.18 → 2189.10] Those with hair being whipped.
[2190.16 → 2191.48] Freezing cold, standing up there.
[2191.54 → 2195.16] It's the middle of summer, but, you know, when you're out there, the wind, you know, you're moving along.
[2195.24 → 2196.34] The wind is blowing, and it's cold.
[2197.06 → 2199.14] So we made our way out there to the front of the ferry.
[2199.14 → 2204.38] We did have to go back for my eldest daughter, and we convinced her to come out at one point.
[2204.58 → 2205.32] But she's not in the picture.
[2207.04 → 2216.26] We stayed there for most of the ride, even though the wind was freezing cold, and even though we didn't have on jackets.
[2216.66 → 2217.26] Now, why?
[2217.50 → 2219.48] Why would we stand there and just freeze ourselves?
[2219.48 → 2230.64] Why would other people, a couple, also stand out there, and we talk together, and we point out everything we see, and we share that experience together?
[2231.82 → 2241.36] The reason we were up there, the reason others were up there, is because when you are up there on this ferry, you're kind of high up, you're overlooking the water, and the world opens up to you.
[2241.36 → 2244.86] And it enlarges in its beauty before you.
[2245.96 → 2250.82] And as you take it all in, in a sense, it changes you.
[2251.48 → 2253.12] And you know it's changing you.
[2253.72 → 2255.46] And that's why you just want to stand there.
[2256.08 → 2261.42] And you want to take it all in, and you want to gaze at it for as long as you can.
[2262.58 → 2269.14] Now, most of the Bible is spent, like my life and your life, in the thickets of the ordinary.
[2269.14 → 2273.56] Just really ordinary things often happen in the Bible.
[2274.14 → 2279.76] But sometimes, you turn a page in the Bible, and this vista opens up.
[2280.22 → 2286.46] And you get to look out, and you take in the wonder of everything that God is doing in the world.
[2287.36 → 2289.66] And this is one of those passages.
[2290.98 → 2296.74] Paul is writing this letter, Colossians, to a young, struggling church.
[2296.74 → 2301.70] This is actually a church that is in danger in many ways.
[2303.46 → 2309.72] In danger not because of persecution from the outside, but in danger because of false teaching on the inside.
[2310.62 → 2313.44] There were false teachers who had found their way into the church,
[2313.98 → 2321.60] and are beginning to preach a gospel contrary to the gospel that Paul had told them.
[2321.60 → 2327.46] So Paul is writing to correct them, to remind them of what the gospel is.
[2328.38 → 2335.16] And so Paul, in these verses, leads all of us, the Colossians and us, upwards to this place.
[2335.56 → 2338.16] And he says, look at this.
[2338.82 → 2339.54] Look at it.
[2339.62 → 2340.34] Take it all in.
[2340.40 → 2342.16] Do you want to understand the gospel?
[2342.82 → 2344.96] Do you want to see what Christianity is all about?
[2344.96 → 2350.20] Then come, stand right here, and gaze out at the beautiful heart of it all.
[2351.32 → 2352.86] And what is the heart?
[2352.98 → 2355.96] What is the centre of the gospel that Paul tells us?
[2356.72 → 2363.28] Friends, the centre, the heart of the gospel, in this passage and in all scripture, is Jesus Christ.
[2364.14 → 2366.02] The heart of the gospel is Jesus Christ.
[2366.02 → 2372.76] And so when we talk about our vision that we are called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ,
[2372.86 → 2378.10] that last phrase, through Jesus Christ, is the most important phrase.
[2379.02 → 2380.18] That's the most important thing.
[2380.74 → 2382.46] This is the centre of our vision.
[2382.86 → 2390.14] And everything that we believe and that we embody as a church and everything we hope together flows out of that.
[2390.14 → 2395.46] It flows out of this proclamation that Jesus is the centre.
[2396.70 → 2400.00] Christ has to be the heart of who we are as a church.
[2401.10 → 2403.24] And so what I want to do is look at our vision statement,
[2403.96 → 2406.56] called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ,
[2406.66 → 2407.92] and I want to look at each part of it.
[2408.36 → 2409.54] Really, it has four parts.
[2410.60 → 2416.80] Called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[2416.80 → 2425.54] So I want to look at each of these and how each one of them is anchored in Jesus Christ,
[2425.80 → 2427.22] that he is the centre of it all.
[2428.16 → 2429.44] So let's look at these together.
[2429.64 → 2436.96] First, the vision of the gospel, the vision of what God is calling us as a church to be and to do,
[2437.12 → 2439.58] is anchored in Jesus Christ.
[2439.58 → 2448.34] That is to say, in Christianity and in our church, everything is anchored in Jesus Christ.
[2449.14 → 2453.22] And throughout the scriptures, and really throughout this passage in Colossians as well,
[2453.56 → 2456.66] you see that we are anchored in Jesus Christ for two reasons.
[2458.18 → 2462.16] This is why we believe that our lives are to be anchored in Christ for two reasons.
[2462.80 → 2465.88] First, because of who Jesus is.
[2467.10 → 2468.28] Who Jesus is.
[2468.28 → 2472.62] So listen to how Paul describes Jesus from this passage.
[2473.04 → 2474.30] I'm just going to read some phrases.
[2474.54 → 2479.76] So if you have the Bible open, beginning in verse 15, let's just look through this passage.
[2480.30 → 2484.20] Verse 15, Jesus is the image of the invisible God.
[2485.20 → 2488.14] He is the firstborn over all creation.
[2488.92 → 2491.54] Verse 16, in him all things were created.
[2492.06 → 2494.32] All things have been created through him and for him.
[2494.96 → 2497.68] Verse 17, he is before all things.
[2497.68 → 2499.94] And in him all things hold together.
[2500.94 → 2504.16] Verse 18, he is the head of the body, the church.
[2504.64 → 2508.30] And he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead.
[2509.24 → 2512.94] Verse 19, God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him.
[2514.44 → 2517.30] All right, so this is how the Bible teaches us to think about Jesus.
[2517.66 → 2522.74] All right, Jesus is not just some interesting guy in history that is full of interesting people
[2522.74 → 2525.48] who said and did things that we ought to admire.
[2526.00 → 2532.48] Paul teaches that he was, and he is the very fullness of the living God.
[2533.52 → 2536.10] The one who was before all things.
[2536.38 → 2538.20] The one who created all things.
[2538.50 → 2540.24] The one who sustains all things.
[2540.60 → 2544.46] And the one who has come to dwell with us as a man to reveal to us,
[2544.74 → 2546.02] as no one else can,
[2546.58 → 2548.34] the true glory of the living God.
[2548.34 → 2550.12] That is who Jesus is.
[2550.90 → 2556.08] So, as you looked in the mirror this morning.
[2557.26 → 2558.88] How many of you looked in the mirror this morning?
[2560.44 → 2561.72] A couple of you, that's good.
[2563.78 → 2565.24] Just as you look in the mirror,
[2565.38 → 2568.68] and that mirror perfectly reflects your image back to yourself.
[2568.68 → 2571.02] So, we look at Jesus.
[2571.44 → 2575.64] And Jesus perfectly reflects the image of the fullness of God.
[2577.42 → 2579.60] All of God's grace and kindness,
[2580.26 → 2582.32] all of his mercy and his justice,
[2582.74 → 2584.58] everything that God is,
[2584.92 → 2587.90] is found perfectly in Jesus Christ.
[2589.04 → 2593.10] And so, we anchor the gospel in Jesus because of who Jesus is.
[2593.16 → 2595.04] He is the true and living God.
[2595.04 → 2598.82] But we also anchor our gospel in Jesus,
[2598.96 → 2600.56] not because of who he is only,
[2600.90 → 2602.86] but also because of what he does.
[2603.42 → 2604.92] Okay, not just in his person,
[2605.26 → 2606.72] but also in his work.
[2607.52 → 2610.06] And Paul describes this work in several ways.
[2610.96 → 2612.88] First, it's the work of creation.
[2613.48 → 2614.72] That's how the passage begins.
[2614.82 → 2615.86] So, look at verse 16.
[2617.42 → 2618.38] Verse 16.
[2618.52 → 2619.46] For in him,
[2620.14 → 2621.50] all things were
[2621.50 → 2623.02] created.
[2623.02 → 2625.52] Things in heaven and on earth,
[2625.68 → 2626.74] visible and invisible,
[2627.32 → 2629.74] whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,
[2630.00 → 2631.98] all things have been created
[2631.98 → 2633.32] through him
[2633.32 → 2634.74] and for him.
[2636.10 → 2636.80] Okay, so,
[2637.10 → 2638.24] Paul teaches us
[2638.24 → 2640.72] that everything that we know
[2640.72 → 2642.44] comes
[2642.44 → 2645.08] from the creating work of Christ.
[2645.96 → 2646.40] So,
[2646.94 → 2649.18] our gospel is rooted in Jesus
[2649.18 → 2651.32] because everything comes from Jesus.
[2651.32 → 2651.72] Right?
[2652.38 → 2653.20] That only makes sense, right?
[2653.38 → 2654.70] Everything is created by him
[2654.70 → 2657.00] and so everything that we are and do
[2657.00 → 2657.90] is rooted in him.
[2658.22 → 2659.20] The whole world
[2659.20 → 2660.68] is his creative work.
[2661.70 → 2663.16] So, that's the work of creation.
[2663.40 → 2663.96] But also,
[2664.08 → 2665.38] we see the work of incarnation.
[2666.50 → 2667.32] Incarnation means
[2667.32 → 2668.80] to come and dwell among us.
[2669.44 → 2670.64] So, look at verse 19.
[2671.74 → 2672.98] Verse 19 says,
[2673.10 → 2674.52] for God was pleased
[2674.52 → 2676.32] to have all of his fullness
[2676.32 → 2677.28] dwell in him.
[2677.28 → 2679.22] So, here,
[2679.64 → 2680.56] Paul is telling us
[2680.56 → 2682.50] that part of what Jesus has done
[2682.50 → 2685.28] is not only he has made all things,
[2685.64 → 2688.02] but that he has come to dwell as God
[2688.02 → 2689.64] in the midst of all things.
[2690.44 → 2691.96] So, we root our gospel in Jesus
[2691.96 → 2693.68] because he is the living God
[2693.68 → 2696.52] who has come to dwell among us.
[2697.94 → 2700.32] But there's a third work of Jesus.
[2701.08 → 2702.52] He creates the world,
[2702.68 → 2704.62] he comes, and he dwells in it,
[2704.62 → 2706.24] and third is the work of salvation.
[2706.96 → 2708.00] So, look at verse 20.
[2709.96 → 2710.90] And through him
[2710.90 → 2713.14] to reconcile to himself all things,
[2713.48 → 2714.54] whether things on earth
[2714.54 → 2715.38] or things in heaven,
[2715.72 → 2716.64] by making peace
[2716.64 → 2718.08] through his bloodshed on the cross.
[2721.22 → 2722.38] So, in this passage,
[2722.52 → 2723.66] Paul teaches us
[2723.66 → 2724.82] that the reason
[2724.82 → 2727.48] that the one who made us
[2727.48 → 2729.58] comes and dwells among us
[2729.58 → 2731.58] is so that he might save us,
[2732.30 → 2732.46] right?
[2732.46 → 2733.64] That he might redeem
[2733.64 → 2735.08] the world that he made
[2735.08 → 2736.50] through his death on the cross
[2736.50 → 2738.26] and through his resurrection
[2738.26 → 2738.98] from the dead.
[2739.70 → 2741.32] Jesus comes to reconcile us,
[2741.36 → 2742.80] to set us right,
[2743.00 → 2743.76] to set to right
[2743.76 → 2744.74] all that he has made.
[2745.78 → 2746.86] And so, our gospel, friends,
[2746.90 → 2748.20] is anchored in Jesus,
[2748.30 → 2750.40] not just because he made us
[2750.40 → 2752.06] and he dwells among us,
[2752.16 → 2753.94] but because he has come to save us.
[2754.78 → 2756.32] That's why we are anchored in him.
[2756.56 → 2758.02] The gospel is anchored in Jesus
[2758.02 → 2759.98] because of who he is
[2759.98 → 2761.52] and what he has done.
[2764.00 → 2765.66] So, do you want to know
[2765.66 → 2766.54] who God is?
[2767.80 → 2770.48] Do you want to know
[2770.48 → 2771.94] what God thinks of you?
[2772.98 → 2775.12] Do you struggle to know
[2775.12 → 2776.06] who you are?
[2777.20 → 2777.36] Right?
[2777.48 → 2779.36] Are you worried about the future?
[2780.36 → 2781.30] Do you want to know
[2781.30 → 2782.30] if there is hope
[2782.30 → 2783.10] for yourself,
[2783.48 → 2784.44] for your relationships,
[2784.44 → 2786.00] and for this world?
[2786.40 → 2787.18] Paul says,
[2787.58 → 2788.58] in every case,
[2789.50 → 2790.28] look to Jesus.
[2791.14 → 2792.58] Everything is anchored in Jesus
[2792.58 → 2794.62] and this is his message to us.
[2795.62 → 2796.88] So, I just want to be clear
[2796.88 → 2798.48] that this is the most important thing
[2798.48 → 2799.74] about our vision as a church.
[2801.10 → 2802.42] You know, we can have,
[2802.48 → 2803.16] as a church,
[2804.16 → 2805.50] plans for the ministry
[2805.50 → 2806.50] we want to do together.
[2806.90 → 2809.66] We can have awesome ideas.
[2810.56 → 2811.86] We can have hopes
[2811.86 → 2813.02] for our life together.
[2813.02 → 2816.02] We can have all these hopes
[2816.02 → 2817.22] of what we want to be
[2817.22 → 2819.76] together as a church.
[2819.88 → 2820.66] We can have all these hopes
[2820.66 → 2822.04] of what we want to do together
[2822.04 → 2822.74] as a church.
[2822.90 → 2824.56] But all of it is nothing
[2824.56 → 2825.76] if Christ is not the centre.
[2826.28 → 2827.48] Remember last week,
[2827.58 → 2828.50] Bill Tuning preached
[2828.50 → 2829.94] on 1 Corinthians 15.
[2830.12 → 2831.40] If Christ is not risen,
[2831.82 → 2832.98] our hope is futile.
[2833.84 → 2834.68] In the same way,
[2834.74 → 2836.22] if Christ is not the centre
[2836.22 → 2838.10] of everything we are,
[2838.22 → 2839.06] everything we do,
[2840.06 → 2841.18] what are we doing?
[2841.18 → 2844.26] He is the centre.
[2844.40 → 2845.44] Because of who he is,
[2845.48 → 2846.60] he is the living God.
[2847.08 → 2848.42] Because of what he has done,
[2848.50 → 2849.66] he has made all things.
[2849.98 → 2851.82] He has come to indwell all things
[2851.82 → 2853.20] and he has done so
[2853.20 → 2854.98] because he is redeeming all things.
[2855.06 → 2857.62] It's all anchored in Christ.
[2859.66 → 2861.30] So that's the first thing we see here.
[2861.64 → 2862.84] Through Jesus Christ.
[2862.84 → 2865.94] And with Christ as our anchor,
[2866.20 → 2867.40] the heart and the centre
[2867.40 → 2868.96] of everything we are about,
[2869.36 → 2870.28] the second thing for us
[2870.28 → 2871.30] to consider this morning
[2871.30 → 2873.46] is that we are called through Christ.
[2873.88 → 2875.14] We are called through Christ.
[2875.78 → 2876.84] What does that mean?
[2877.66 → 2879.06] Well, it means that God
[2879.06 → 2880.72] has called us to himself.
[2881.74 → 2883.36] God has called us to himself.
[2884.00 → 2885.48] It means that we are here
[2885.48 → 2886.74] this morning
[2886.74 → 2889.80] not because necessarily
[2889.80 → 2892.46] that we decided to be here.
[2892.52 → 2893.26] I mean, that's often
[2893.26 → 2893.88] the way we think.
[2894.00 → 2896.22] Oh, I decided to come to church.
[2896.38 → 2897.76] I decided to follow Christ
[2897.76 → 2898.36] and be a Christian.
[2900.12 → 2901.74] I mean, in a sense, yes,
[2901.78 → 2902.62] but ultimately,
[2903.10 → 2904.44] underneath that
[2904.44 → 2906.14] is that we are here
[2906.14 → 2908.02] because God has called us
[2908.02 → 2909.60] to be in a relationship with him.
[2910.64 → 2913.72] And so look at verses 21 and 22.
[2913.80 → 2915.84] And notice how many
[2915.84 → 2918.16] relationship words are used there.
[2918.16 → 2919.82] verse 21.
[2920.00 → 2920.80] First he says,
[2921.68 → 2924.12] once you were alienated from God
[2924.12 → 2925.12] and were enemies.
[2926.26 → 2928.42] And then in verse 22 he says,
[2928.80 → 2931.38] but now he has reconciled you.
[2932.40 → 2934.56] So we were alienated from God
[2934.56 → 2936.50] and we had to be reconciled.
[2937.02 → 2937.94] And this suggests
[2937.94 → 2938.86] that our relationship
[2938.86 → 2940.24] with God was broken, right?
[2940.26 → 2941.60] We were alienated from him
[2941.60 → 2942.40] and what we needed
[2942.40 → 2944.22] was reconciliation with him.
[2945.00 → 2946.54] And so the Bible tells us
[2946.54 → 2949.44] that our main problem
[2949.44 → 2951.20] is not that we are lawbreakers.
[2952.00 → 2953.20] The Bible tells us
[2953.20 → 2954.38] that our main problem
[2954.38 → 2956.82] is that we are relationship breakers.
[2958.02 → 2959.64] Because you and I were made
[2959.64 → 2962.52] more than any other relationship.
[2962.66 → 2963.98] We were made for a relationship
[2963.98 → 2965.18] with God who made us
[2965.18 → 2965.98] and who loves us.
[2966.82 → 2967.92] But the tragedy
[2967.92 → 2968.90] of the human condition
[2968.90 → 2969.92] is that sin
[2969.92 → 2971.54] has broken our relationship
[2971.54 → 2972.12] with God.
[2972.12 → 2974.08] And rather than being
[2974.08 → 2976.08] one with God
[2976.08 → 2977.54] in joyful intimacy,
[2977.70 → 2979.44] the way he had created us to be,
[2980.34 → 2981.50] we are now
[2981.50 → 2983.32] separated from God.
[2984.10 → 2986.14] We are separated from his presence.
[2986.28 → 2987.90] We are deeply separated from him.
[2988.76 → 2989.62] So at the root
[2989.62 → 2992.06] of all of our loneliness,
[2992.90 → 2994.70] the root of our anxiety,
[2995.14 → 2997.04] our sense of spiritual emptiness,
[2997.60 → 2999.12] is this alienation,
[2999.12 → 3000.52] the separation
[3000.52 → 3001.62] that we all experience
[3001.62 → 3002.52] from God himself.
[3003.92 → 3005.16] But God loves you.
[3006.22 → 3007.36] And because he loves you,
[3007.48 → 3008.98] he sent Jesus to save you.
[3009.62 → 3010.86] So look at verse 22.
[3011.08 → 3011.78] Verse 22
[3011.78 → 3015.72] has that gospel conjunction.
[3016.90 → 3017.20] But,
[3017.82 → 3018.64] you see that but?
[3019.18 → 3020.24] Always when you see a bit.
[3020.34 → 3021.02] Well, not always, but.
[3021.66 → 3022.44] Circle the but.
[3023.22 → 3024.26] But God.
[3024.26 → 3027.26] You are alienated from God.
[3027.34 → 3028.24] You are enemies with God.
[3028.64 → 3028.90] But,
[3029.84 → 3030.50] God.
[3030.88 → 3031.32] But now,
[3031.50 → 3032.98] he has reconciled you
[3032.98 → 3034.46] by Christ's physical body
[3034.46 → 3035.60] through death
[3035.60 → 3036.40] to present you
[3036.40 → 3037.58] wholly in his sight
[3037.58 → 3038.56] without blemish
[3038.56 → 3039.86] and free from accusation.
[3041.18 → 3041.28] Right?
[3041.32 → 3042.14] What Paul says here
[3042.14 → 3043.14] is that God acted
[3043.14 → 3044.50] to heal the relationship
[3044.50 → 3045.44] between us and him.
[3046.42 → 3046.62] Now,
[3046.66 → 3047.36] when you are in
[3047.36 → 3048.34] a broken relationship,
[3049.20 → 3051.16] you know how painful
[3051.16 → 3051.74] it can be
[3051.74 → 3052.66] to be separated,
[3052.66 → 3054.72] to be alienated
[3054.72 → 3055.50] from someone
[3055.50 → 3056.74] whom you love.
[3058.14 → 3058.66] Whether,
[3058.82 → 3058.98] you know,
[3059.02 → 3059.62] it's a friend,
[3060.12 → 3061.32] whether it's a family member
[3061.32 → 3063.08] or someone else you love.
[3063.48 → 3065.02] And the most important step
[3065.02 → 3066.22] in a broken relationship
[3066.22 → 3068.30] is the first step.
[3069.42 → 3069.62] Right?
[3069.68 → 3070.26] You're separated.
[3072.02 → 3073.40] Who is going to go
[3073.40 → 3074.40] toward the other
[3074.40 → 3075.36] first?
[3076.22 → 3077.36] And the Bible says
[3077.36 → 3078.64] that in our relationship
[3078.64 → 3079.26] with him,
[3080.04 → 3081.80] God took the first step.
[3081.80 → 3083.94] even before we
[3083.94 → 3085.58] desired to be
[3085.58 → 3086.30] restored to God,
[3086.38 → 3087.68] even while our backs
[3087.68 → 3088.96] were turned away
[3088.96 → 3089.48] from him,
[3089.80 → 3091.54] while we were enemies,
[3092.64 → 3093.64] God acted.
[3094.44 → 3095.76] The offended one,
[3096.12 → 3096.30] right?
[3097.22 → 3097.84] It's not like God
[3097.84 → 3098.72] did anything to us.
[3099.28 → 3100.72] He was the offended one,
[3101.24 → 3102.44] and yet he steps
[3102.44 → 3103.96] towards us in love
[3103.96 → 3105.92] because he heals
[3105.92 → 3106.50] the division
[3106.50 → 3107.42] between us and him.
[3108.18 → 3108.84] And in fact,
[3108.92 → 3110.20] Jesus took upon himself
[3110.20 → 3110.98] the full weight
[3110.98 → 3111.70] of our sin
[3111.70 → 3113.14] against him
[3113.14 → 3114.26] in his body
[3114.26 → 3114.90] on the cross
[3114.90 → 3116.68] to reconcile us
[3116.68 → 3117.34] forever to God.
[3119.44 → 3120.44] So what does that mean
[3120.44 → 3121.46] for us as a church?
[3122.70 → 3123.14] First,
[3123.24 → 3123.68] it means
[3123.68 → 3125.66] that inviting people
[3125.66 → 3127.32] into a reconciled
[3127.32 → 3128.46] relationship with God
[3128.46 → 3129.58] is at the heart
[3129.58 → 3130.28] of our vision.
[3130.92 → 3131.34] Right?
[3131.38 → 3132.42] We want to be a church
[3132.42 → 3133.58] that proclaims
[3133.58 → 3134.38] the good news
[3134.38 → 3136.30] that God loves sinners
[3136.30 → 3137.62] like me
[3137.62 → 3139.00] and like you.
[3140.78 → 3142.20] And he made us.
[3143.46 → 3144.44] And he made us
[3144.44 → 3145.04] for himself,
[3145.22 → 3146.42] and he made a way
[3146.42 → 3147.80] for us to be reconciled
[3147.80 → 3148.16] to him.
[3149.06 → 3149.20] Right?
[3149.26 → 3149.94] That's our message.
[3150.30 → 3150.94] That's our gospel.
[3151.62 → 3152.36] And secondly,
[3152.50 → 3153.52] because we have been
[3153.52 → 3154.14] called to God,
[3154.24 → 3155.12] we want to know
[3155.12 → 3155.60] this God.
[3155.66 → 3156.22] We want to know
[3156.22 → 3156.80] the God
[3156.80 → 3157.96] we were made for.
[3158.04 → 3158.58] We want to know
[3158.58 → 3159.04] the God
[3159.04 → 3159.98] who has sought
[3159.98 → 3160.98] to reconcile us
[3160.98 → 3161.44] to himself
[3161.44 → 3162.26] through Christ.
[3162.54 → 3163.82] We want to worship him.
[3163.82 → 3166.10] We want to order
[3166.10 → 3166.98] our lives
[3166.98 → 3168.16] around him.
[3169.28 → 3169.42] Okay?
[3169.46 → 3170.06] So we are called
[3170.06 → 3170.64] through Christ.
[3171.18 → 3171.48] Third,
[3171.88 → 3172.26] though,
[3172.50 → 3173.34] we are called
[3173.34 → 3174.28] together
[3174.28 → 3175.98] through Jesus Christ.
[3176.24 → 3176.78] We are called
[3176.78 → 3177.26] together.
[3177.86 → 3178.54] When you become
[3178.54 → 3179.00] a Christian,
[3179.16 → 3179.60] you are called
[3179.60 → 3180.20] to Christ,
[3180.58 → 3181.28] but you're also
[3181.28 → 3182.36] called into a community.
[3183.60 → 3183.72] Right?
[3183.82 → 3184.58] So what that means
[3184.58 → 3185.62] is there is no such
[3185.62 → 3186.92] thing as a lonely,
[3187.18 → 3188.02] isolated Christian.
[3189.60 → 3190.38] That's why
[3190.38 → 3190.88] I
[3190.88 → 3194.34] have mixed feelings
[3194.34 → 3195.06] about live stream.
[3195.88 → 3196.16] I mean,
[3196.18 → 3197.02] on the one hand,
[3197.64 → 3198.10] it's great.
[3198.20 → 3198.34] You know,
[3198.40 → 3199.92] maybe you're sick
[3199.92 → 3200.64] or we have shut-ins
[3200.64 → 3201.28] or you're travelling
[3201.28 → 3202.92] and you can be part
[3202.92 → 3204.34] of what we're doing here.
[3204.44 → 3205.64] You can tune in.
[3206.32 → 3207.30] But that shouldn't be
[3207.30 → 3207.82] your, like,
[3208.20 → 3209.40] your Christian life
[3209.40 → 3210.80] is sitting by yourself
[3210.80 → 3211.74] watching the screen.
[3212.30 → 3212.74] Because
[3212.74 → 3214.92] we are meant
[3214.92 → 3215.56] to be brought
[3215.56 → 3216.56] into a community.
[3218.46 → 3218.70] You know,
[3218.80 → 3219.58] of course,
[3219.70 → 3220.52] the Christian life
[3220.52 → 3222.14] is deeply personal.
[3223.14 → 3223.98] It's personal, right?
[3224.04 → 3225.18] God wants you
[3225.18 → 3226.60] to know him personally.
[3226.78 → 3227.40] It's not enough
[3227.40 → 3229.48] for you to rely on,
[3229.58 → 3229.78] you know,
[3229.80 → 3230.22] as a kid,
[3230.28 → 3230.90] your parents
[3230.90 → 3233.58] for your Christian life.
[3233.94 → 3234.26] Eventually,
[3234.42 → 3235.38] you need to grow up
[3235.38 → 3236.98] into experiencing
[3236.98 → 3237.72] and knowing
[3237.72 → 3239.22] God personally.
[3240.64 → 3241.96] He walks with you
[3241.96 → 3242.34] personally
[3242.34 → 3243.12] through his spirit
[3243.12 → 3243.72] who is in you.
[3243.96 → 3244.68] You spend time
[3244.68 → 3245.52] with him personally
[3245.52 → 3246.48] through reading the Bible
[3246.48 → 3247.10] and through prayer.
[3247.42 → 3248.28] It is personal,
[3248.28 → 3250.00] but it is not
[3250.00 → 3251.22] individualistic.
[3252.06 → 3253.16] It's not just
[3253.16 → 3254.22] about you and God.
[3254.36 → 3255.36] It's about being part
[3255.36 → 3257.10] of God's new community,
[3257.62 → 3258.24] his family.
[3258.76 → 3259.48] And we see that
[3259.48 → 3260.04] in our text
[3260.04 → 3260.90] in verse 18.
[3261.68 → 3262.90] So look at verse 18.
[3264.68 → 3265.48] Paul says,
[3266.32 → 3266.60] he,
[3266.90 → 3267.18] Jesus,
[3267.98 → 3268.80] is the head
[3268.80 → 3269.64] of the body,
[3270.46 → 3271.00] the church.
[3272.38 → 3272.58] All right,
[3272.62 → 3273.10] and this is one
[3273.10 → 3273.70] of the metaphors
[3273.70 → 3274.22] of the Bible
[3274.22 → 3275.14] that the Bible
[3275.14 → 3276.04] uses to talk
[3276.04 → 3277.32] about this new humanity
[3277.32 → 3278.42] that God is redeeming.
[3278.68 → 3279.42] It's the body
[3279.42 → 3280.04] of Christ.
[3280.52 → 3281.34] And that means
[3281.34 → 3281.92] as the body,
[3282.04 → 3283.34] there's interdependence.
[3283.82 → 3283.92] Right?
[3284.00 → 3284.52] As connected
[3284.52 → 3285.30] as your foot
[3285.30 → 3286.44] is to your leg,
[3286.84 → 3288.06] as your ear
[3288.06 → 3289.08] and your nose
[3289.08 → 3290.18] is to your face,
[3290.40 → 3291.50] this is how closely
[3291.50 → 3292.62] bound up we are
[3292.62 → 3294.00] together with one another.
[3294.48 → 3295.98] We are the body
[3295.98 → 3296.54] of Christ.
[3297.54 → 3298.56] And we live
[3298.56 → 3299.16] in a world
[3299.16 → 3300.62] where people
[3300.62 → 3301.78] are alienated.
[3302.52 → 3303.82] We are alienated
[3303.82 → 3304.50] from one another.
[3304.50 → 3306.44] There is social division
[3306.44 → 3307.16] in the world.
[3307.46 → 3308.68] There are broken relationships.
[3308.92 → 3309.82] There is hostility
[3309.82 → 3312.60] between people
[3312.60 → 3314.08] in all kinds of ways.
[3315.14 → 3316.14] And one thing
[3316.14 → 3317.00] that God is doing
[3317.00 → 3318.06] through the church
[3318.06 → 3319.50] is making it the place
[3319.50 → 3320.26] where relationships
[3320.26 → 3320.74] are healed.
[3321.76 → 3322.50] Where people
[3322.50 → 3324.48] from different ethnicities
[3324.48 → 3325.36] that might be hostile
[3325.36 → 3326.02] to one another,
[3326.66 → 3328.30] from different social standings
[3328.30 → 3329.70] who might fight
[3329.70 → 3332.76] and try to conquer
[3332.76 → 3333.34] one another,
[3334.10 → 3334.30] right?
[3334.30 → 3335.06] where men
[3335.06 → 3335.84] and women,
[3336.22 → 3337.44] we are brought together
[3337.44 → 3338.92] to become a spiritual family
[3338.92 → 3340.24] through Jesus Christ.
[3341.34 → 3342.68] And this too
[3342.68 → 3343.92] is central to our vision
[3343.92 → 3345.32] to see people
[3345.32 → 3346.48] not just brought to God
[3346.48 → 3348.16] but to belong
[3348.16 → 3349.80] to the new family
[3349.80 → 3350.24] in Christ
[3350.24 → 3351.30] that God is redeeming
[3351.30 → 3351.78] and creating.
[3352.12 → 3352.24] Okay,
[3352.28 → 3353.24] so we are called
[3353.24 → 3354.08] together.
[3354.36 → 3355.00] We're called together.
[3356.08 → 3357.32] One last thing though,
[3357.52 → 3358.74] we are also for the renewal
[3358.74 → 3359.76] of all things
[3359.76 → 3360.84] through Jesus Christ.
[3360.84 → 3365.18] So here,
[3365.26 → 3366.00] I want you to remember
[3366.00 → 3366.94] the story of the Bible.
[3368.38 → 3370.20] When God made the world
[3370.20 → 3371.58] back in Genesis 1 and 2,
[3372.06 → 3374.56] he said seven times
[3374.56 → 3376.26] that it is what?
[3377.66 → 3378.14] Good.
[3378.88 → 3379.10] Right?
[3379.30 → 3380.80] God speaks from heaven
[3380.80 → 3383.02] seven times,
[3383.22 → 3385.32] he says creation is good.
[3385.32 → 3387.68] So we've got to listen to that.
[3388.50 → 3389.24] What does God think
[3389.24 → 3389.98] about this creation?
[3391.40 → 3391.92] Good.
[3392.54 → 3393.00] It's good.
[3393.92 → 3395.14] But we sinned.
[3395.70 → 3396.20] Human beings,
[3396.32 → 3396.84] we sinned.
[3397.00 → 3397.84] And when we did,
[3398.04 → 3398.86] we plunged
[3398.86 → 3400.08] not only ourselves
[3400.08 → 3401.70] but the whole creation
[3401.70 → 3403.06] into ruinous captivity.
[3403.06 → 3404.90] So,
[3405.70 → 3407.72] we are estranged
[3407.72 → 3408.36] from God
[3408.36 → 3409.08] who made us
[3409.08 → 3409.60] and we are under
[3409.60 → 3410.12] his judgment.
[3411.16 → 3412.18] We ourselves
[3412.18 → 3413.72] as men and women
[3413.72 → 3416.10] are broken messes.
[3417.52 → 3418.34] Anybody here
[3418.34 → 3419.00] a broken mess?
[3424.48 → 3425.08] Also,
[3425.62 → 3426.76] our relationships
[3426.76 → 3429.44] become destroyed.
[3430.40 → 3431.08] Our communities
[3431.08 → 3432.32] and then creation
[3432.32 → 3434.64] itself is in disarray.
[3435.30 → 3435.90] Paul tells us
[3435.90 → 3436.30] in Romans
[3436.30 → 3436.98] that creation
[3436.98 → 3437.80] is groaning.
[3439.00 → 3440.12] The Bible says
[3440.12 → 3440.72] that we live
[3440.72 → 3441.86] under this terrible curse
[3441.86 → 3443.16] and this is where
[3443.16 → 3444.84] we woke up this morning.
[3446.20 → 3448.10] But over and over
[3448.10 → 3449.08] throughout the Bible,
[3449.46 → 3450.34] starting right in
[3450.34 → 3451.44] Genesis chapter 3,
[3451.76 → 3452.86] God makes the promise
[3452.86 → 3453.60] that one day
[3453.60 → 3454.66] he is going to send
[3454.66 → 3455.60] a Saviour.
[3456.80 → 3457.86] And that Saviour
[3457.86 → 3459.30] is going to make
[3459.30 → 3460.16] everything new.
[3460.16 → 3462.12] all creation
[3462.12 → 3464.06] that God made good
[3464.06 → 3465.08] that has fallen
[3465.08 → 3466.22] into ruinous captivity,
[3466.66 → 3467.88] God is going to redeem.
[3468.90 → 3469.62] He promises
[3469.62 → 3470.86] that harmony
[3470.86 → 3471.94] is going to be restored
[3471.94 → 3472.94] between us and God
[3472.94 → 3473.92] so that we
[3473.92 → 3475.44] who are made
[3475.44 → 3476.42] in his own image
[3476.42 → 3477.28] can be brought back
[3477.28 → 3477.92] into relationship
[3477.92 → 3478.46] with him.
[3479.00 → 3479.74] He promises
[3479.74 → 3480.60] that as men
[3480.60 → 3481.26] and women,
[3481.68 → 3482.82] we can be made new.
[3484.28 → 3485.08] You and I,
[3485.22 → 3485.78] because of sin,
[3485.96 → 3486.96] we are broken messes,
[3487.10 → 3488.12] but through faith
[3488.12 → 3488.58] in Christ,
[3488.86 → 3490.40] we are made new.
[3490.58 → 3491.20] Paul calls us
[3491.20 → 3492.10] new creations.
[3493.58 → 3494.42] He tells us
[3494.42 → 3495.50] that our relationships
[3495.50 → 3496.92] can be healed.
[3498.58 → 3499.76] And he tells us
[3499.76 → 3500.94] that the world itself
[3500.94 → 3502.08] will be restored.
[3502.88 → 3504.02] So the Bible tells us
[3504.02 → 3505.14] that this is
[3505.14 → 3506.08] our promised future,
[3506.48 → 3507.14] the restoration
[3507.14 → 3508.12] of all things.
[3508.54 → 3509.70] And it's this vision
[3509.70 → 3510.80] that Paul has in mind
[3510.80 → 3511.66] in our passage.
[3512.30 → 3513.56] So listen to what he says
[3513.56 → 3515.02] here in verses 19 and 20.
[3516.64 → 3517.48] It says this,
[3517.56 → 3519.40] For God was pleased
[3519.40 → 3520.78] to have all of his fullness
[3520.78 → 3521.90] dwell in him,
[3521.94 → 3522.52] that is Jesus,
[3522.84 → 3523.98] and through him
[3523.98 → 3524.66] to reconcile
[3524.66 → 3526.06] to himself
[3526.06 → 3527.74] some things.
[3528.74 → 3529.08] No,
[3529.52 → 3531.54] all things,
[3532.12 → 3533.66] whether things on heaven,
[3534.32 → 3534.86] on earth,
[3534.98 → 3535.78] or things in heaven,
[3536.28 → 3537.10] by making peace
[3537.10 → 3537.72] through his blood
[3537.72 → 3538.66] shed on the cross.
[3539.56 → 3540.22] So the vision
[3540.22 → 3541.20] that Paul gives us here
[3541.20 → 3541.86] in these words
[3541.86 → 3542.42] is a vision
[3542.42 → 3543.56] that God's Saviour
[3543.56 → 3546.38] at last has come
[3546.38 → 3547.30] and he is going
[3547.30 → 3548.16] to renew all things.
[3548.82 → 3549.52] And when he says
[3549.52 → 3550.46] all things,
[3550.74 → 3551.48] that means
[3551.48 → 3553.02] every single thing
[3553.02 → 3553.96] that has been broken
[3553.96 → 3555.00] and fragmented
[3555.00 → 3556.62] by the curse of sin.
[3557.50 → 3559.16] Not some things,
[3559.96 → 3561.50] not most things,
[3561.88 → 3563.62] not only spiritual,
[3564.06 → 3564.90] churchy things,
[3565.76 → 3566.94] all things.
[3568.24 → 3571.70] Jesus is that triumphant.
[3571.86 → 3573.12] When Jesus rose
[3573.12 → 3573.84] from the dead
[3573.84 → 3575.44] in his new body,
[3575.80 → 3576.58] conquering sin
[3576.58 → 3577.42] and death,
[3578.04 → 3578.84] and he ascended
[3578.84 → 3580.22] to the throne of God
[3580.22 → 3581.26] and he is reigning
[3581.26 → 3581.80] over
[3581.80 → 3584.30] not just some things,
[3584.50 → 3585.62] not just the church,
[3586.56 → 3588.08] all things
[3588.08 → 3588.76] have been placed
[3588.76 → 3589.52] under his feet.
[3590.52 → 3591.54] He is that good.
[3591.92 → 3592.96] He is that glorious.
[3593.52 → 3594.56] He is that powerful.
[3595.10 → 3596.36] He is the triumphant,
[3596.62 → 3597.38] sovereign Lord
[3597.38 → 3598.46] over all things.
[3599.18 → 3601.10] As Revelation 21 says,
[3601.76 → 3602.88] he who is seated
[3602.88 → 3603.58] on the throne
[3603.58 → 3604.12] said,
[3604.74 → 3605.20] I am making
[3605.20 → 3605.94] everything new.
[3607.76 → 3609.04] So what does that mean
[3609.04 → 3609.92] for us as a church?
[3610.92 → 3611.72] It means this.
[3612.00 → 3612.46] It means that
[3612.46 → 3613.68] as followers of Jesus,
[3613.86 → 3615.26] God is inviting us
[3615.26 → 3617.16] to join him
[3617.16 → 3618.38] in his work of renewal.
[3619.88 → 3620.82] Just the other day,
[3620.90 → 3621.82] my daughter Ellie,
[3622.10 → 3622.36] this is like
[3622.36 → 3622.98] a couple of days ago,
[3623.10 → 3623.50] she said,
[3623.72 → 3624.48] I'm going to bake
[3624.48 → 3625.16] some brownies.
[3625.96 → 3626.84] And my youngest daughter,
[3626.84 → 3627.76] Gabby said,
[3627.96 → 3629.10] I want to make
[3629.10 → 3629.94] some brownies too.
[3630.80 → 3631.12] Right?
[3631.18 → 3631.52] Of course.
[3632.06 → 3632.94] The thing is,
[3633.28 → 3634.14] Gabby is too young
[3634.14 → 3634.80] to make brownies
[3634.80 → 3635.42] by herself.
[3636.32 → 3637.16] So what did Ellie do?
[3638.74 → 3640.94] After a little probing,
[3641.18 → 3642.88] she said,
[3643.32 → 3643.70] Gabby,
[3643.92 → 3645.02] come into the kitchen
[3645.02 → 3647.92] and let's make brownies together.
[3649.30 → 3650.66] As little children,
[3651.66 → 3653.10] we don't ultimately
[3653.10 → 3655.16] make brownies ourselves.
[3655.16 → 3656.84] But Jesus,
[3657.04 → 3657.74] in his grace,
[3658.06 → 3659.28] he invites us
[3659.28 → 3660.42] to join him
[3660.42 → 3662.22] with him,
[3662.92 → 3664.30] participating with him
[3664.30 → 3665.70] in his work,
[3666.92 → 3668.06] not making brownies,
[3668.38 → 3670.58] but of renewing all things.
[3671.86 → 3673.60] So in this text in Colossians,
[3674.00 → 3674.80] here's what I think
[3674.80 → 3675.44] Paul is doing.
[3676.90 → 3678.84] I think he's brought us
[3678.84 → 3680.88] to the edge
[3680.88 → 3682.86] of this expansive,
[3682.86 → 3684.84] beautiful vision
[3684.84 → 3685.92] of Jesus' work,
[3686.50 → 3688.22] which is renewing
[3688.22 → 3689.46] all that he has made
[3689.46 → 3690.24] by his grace.
[3690.98 → 3692.56] And then he turns to you,
[3692.82 → 3693.72] he turns to me,
[3693.78 → 3694.46] and he says,
[3694.78 → 3696.18] do you see all of this?
[3696.66 → 3698.06] You can be a part of it too.
[3699.10 → 3699.28] Right?
[3699.38 → 3700.76] If you put your faith in Jesus,
[3700.88 → 3701.82] you can be part
[3701.82 → 3703.12] of this great renewal
[3703.12 → 3704.02] of all things.
[3704.82 → 3706.10] And he is not telling us
[3706.10 → 3706.70] that the great
[3706.70 → 3707.68] and beautiful gospel
[3707.68 → 3709.86] is only about us.
[3709.86 → 3712.12] He is telling us
[3712.12 → 3713.62] that it includes us.
[3714.58 → 3716.32] The gospel is not about us,
[3716.54 → 3717.88] it includes us.
[3718.42 → 3719.86] He is reconciling
[3719.86 → 3720.40] to himself
[3720.40 → 3721.46] all things through Christ,
[3721.62 → 3722.64] and he calls us
[3722.64 → 3724.16] to become part of that
[3724.16 → 3725.64] through us ourselves
[3725.64 → 3727.18] being redeemed
[3727.18 → 3728.30] and brought,
[3728.46 → 3729.34] reconciled to God
[3729.34 → 3730.30] through faith in Christ.
[3731.30 → 3732.48] And then he makes us
[3732.48 → 3733.20] part of a body,
[3733.28 → 3733.86] he brings us into
[3733.86 → 3734.88] a family with others,
[3735.08 → 3736.02] he renews us
[3736.02 → 3737.12] by his spirit personally,
[3737.12 → 3738.44] and he sends us out
[3738.44 → 3739.36] on his mission
[3739.36 → 3742.24] to renew all things.
[3743.82 → 3744.50] And friends,
[3744.58 → 3745.44] that is simultaneously
[3745.44 → 3747.04] humbling
[3747.04 → 3749.30] and exhilarating.
[3750.10 → 3751.62] It is bigger than you,
[3751.72 → 3752.76] it is bigger than me,
[3753.22 → 3754.42] and you get to be
[3754.42 → 3755.02] a part of it
[3755.02 → 3757.14] as you put your faith
[3757.14 → 3757.64] in Jesus.
[3758.72 → 3759.20] So friends,
[3759.24 → 3759.72] that's our vision
[3759.72 → 3760.34] for a church,
[3760.90 → 3761.82] for our church.
[3762.30 → 3764.52] We are called together
[3764.52 → 3765.62] for the renewal
[3765.62 → 3766.54] of all things
[3766.54 → 3767.92] through Jesus Christ.
[3769.06 → 3769.68] Let's pray.
[3772.56 → 3773.24] O Lord,
[3773.34 → 3774.32] open our eyes
[3774.32 → 3774.98] to see
[3774.98 → 3776.48] the wondrous,
[3776.72 → 3777.56] glorious vision
[3777.56 → 3778.56] of the gospel.
[3779.68 → 3780.12] Lord,
[3780.18 → 3781.22] open our hearts
[3781.22 → 3782.88] so that we can
[3782.88 → 3783.60] desire it.
[3784.44 → 3785.00] And O Lord,
[3785.04 → 3785.60] would you order
[3785.60 → 3786.38] our steps
[3786.38 → 3787.70] so that we can
[3787.70 → 3788.66] walk in the ways
[3788.66 → 3789.46] of your commandments.
[3790.24 → 3791.60] We pray in Christ's name.
[3792.22 → 3792.52] Amen.

[3857.52 → 3863.92] All other ground is sinking sand.
[3864.44 → 3876.38] When darkness fills His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[3876.86 → 3887.50] In every high and stormy gale, my anger holds within the veil.
[3887.50 → 3899.50] On Christ the solid and restless end, all other ground is sinking sand.
[3899.50 → 3906.50] All other ground is sinking sand.
[3906.50 → 3918.50] His hope is covered and tensed more, subsoils me in the well-meet flood.
[3918.50 → 3930.50] When all the ground dies, my soul gives way, He then is all my open state.
[3930.50 → 3942.50] On Christ the solid and restless end, all other ground is sinking sand.
[3942.50 → 3949.50] All other ground is sinking sand.
