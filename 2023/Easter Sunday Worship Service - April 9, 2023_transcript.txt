[347.96 --> 355.96]  Welcome this morning to everyone as we celebrate together the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[355.96 --> 360.64]  the horror, the judgment of the cross is over.
[361.56 --> 363.56]  The darkness of the tomb is finished.
[364.28 --> 368.68]  And now, together with the eyewitnesses of Jesus' resurrection
[368.68 --> 372.74]  and all of his disciples throughout the ages,
[373.26 --> 378.52]  we rejoice in the Lord's victory and all that it means for our world.
[380.52 --> 382.52]  Did I make a noise or is that...
[382.52 --> 385.10]  That's off.
[385.96 --> 389.04]  Turn this on?
[390.82 --> 391.92]  Should I leave it on?
[392.70 --> 392.92]  Okay.
[394.00 --> 394.82]  Technical difficulties.
[396.16 --> 400.62]  So today, we are excited that we will be celebrating nine baptisms.
[401.84 --> 405.42]  We will also have the opportunity to flower the cross,
[405.52 --> 408.66]  which I will give some instruction on a bit later.
[409.50 --> 413.18]  And when the time comes, I will invite the children to come up front
[413.18 --> 415.70]  and to hear a children's message.
[416.54 --> 418.44]  I have two quick announcements for us this morning.
[418.84 --> 424.36]  Our seniors' luncheon is this Wednesday at 1130 for those 65 and older.
[424.70 --> 427.18]  And we'll be in the fireside room and we'll enjoy some good food.
[428.18 --> 434.62]  Second announcement is that next Sunday is our first class for our spring cross-training session.
[434.62 --> 437.10]  This is our adult education class.
[437.10 --> 439.18]  And we will be...
[439.18 --> 443.34]  The class will be on the poet George Herbert.
[443.34 --> 449.76]  And we will be reading and discussing some of Herbert's poetry as a window into the Christian life.
[450.02 --> 454.42]  Now, I know maybe not everyone loves poetry, but that is okay.
[454.42 --> 459.28]  Even if you don't love poetry, you can still get a lot out of this class.
[459.38 --> 461.24]  We'll be reading these poems together.
[461.38 --> 462.12]  They're very accessible.
[462.64 --> 465.52]  And we can learn together about the Christian life.
[465.70 --> 468.28]  So please do sign up on the foyer table.
[468.28 --> 476.20]  Now, would you please join in our call to worship this morning from 1 Corinthians 15.
[476.92 --> 478.26]  The words will be on the screen.
[478.76 --> 484.38]  And where it has the double arrow, I invite you to say it out loud together.
[484.38 --> 514.36]  Dear ones, because Christ lives, we by faith can receive the power of God.
[514.38 --> 516.42]  And we will receive his resurrection life.
[517.08 --> 518.18]  Let's pray together.
[520.80 --> 528.08]  Oh God, for our redemption, you gave up your only begotten son, Jesus, to the hideous death of the cross.
[528.84 --> 533.38]  Then by his glorious resurrection, you have delivered us from the power of the enemy.
[534.40 --> 538.24]  This is done by your strength and out of your boundless love.
[539.24 --> 543.18]  It is done through your grace and because of your mercy.
[544.38 --> 548.98]  This divine action is the source of all our hope.
[549.60 --> 552.30]  It is the pledge of our eternal life.
[552.76 --> 555.06]  It is for the healing of our souls.
[555.82 --> 558.40]  And it is the beginning of making all things new.
[559.26 --> 561.52]  We praise you for your awesome wisdom.
[562.08 --> 564.72]  We praise you, Lord, for your tender kindness to us.
[565.18 --> 566.32]  You are our hero.
[567.30 --> 568.58]  You are our champion.
[568.58 --> 570.38]  And our beloved.
[571.12 --> 574.00]  And we pray this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[574.62 --> 575.08]  Amen.
[576.50 --> 577.74]  Friends, please stand.
[578.68 --> 580.54]  For God's greeting to us this morning.
[580.70 --> 583.38]  And of course, we will be using the Easter acclamation.
[584.20 --> 585.00]  And here it is.
[586.62 --> 587.10]  Hallelujah.
[587.80 --> 588.96]  Christ is risen.
[589.68 --> 591.28]  He is risen indeed.
[591.80 --> 592.32]  Hallelujah.
[592.32 --> 595.60]  As you are able, please turn to those around you.
[595.96 --> 597.50]  Greet them in the name of Christ, saying,
[598.14 --> 598.88]  Christ is risen.
[599.26 --> 599.94]  He is risen indeed.
[599.94 --> 607.04]  Thank you.
[607.22 --> 608.38]  Thank you.
[608.38 --> 634.80]  Okay, please remain standing, but I have a word of instruction for us.
[634.80 --> 644.78]  Here we have this beautiful cross, and in the front we have a basket here of flowers, and on this side, another basket of flowers.
[645.58 --> 656.36]  So we are going to sing two songs together, and during that time, anyone is invited to come forward to take a flower and to flower the cross.
[656.36 --> 661.24]  Okay, to put the flower kind of into the webbing, into the greenery.
[661.24 --> 665.96]  If it falls out, it's okay, but you know, just try to stick it in there.
[666.92 --> 670.84]  And so we're going to be singing, and we're going to be moving, so don't be shy.
[670.90 --> 674.18]  If you want to do it, come up and do it, because you only have two songs in which to do this.
[674.24 --> 676.00]  Okay, so it's like five minutes total.
[676.34 --> 677.84]  Okay, so let's sing together.
[677.84 --> 707.82]  Thank you, Father.
[707.84 --> 737.82]  Thank you, Father.
[737.82 --> 767.80]  Thank you, Father.
[767.82 --> 769.82]  Thank you, Father.
[769.82 --> 797.80]  Thank you, Father.
[797.82 --> 799.82]  Thank you, Father.
[799.82 --> 803.82]  Thank you, Father.
[803.82 --> 809.82]  Thank you, Father.
[809.82 --> 810.82]  Amen.
[810.82 --> 811.82]  Amen.
[811.82 --> 812.82]  Amen.
[812.82 --> 813.82]  Amen.
[839.82 --> 841.82]  Amen.
[869.82 --> 870.82]  Amen.
[870.82 --> 871.82]  Amen.
[871.82 --> 872.82]  Amen.
[872.82 --> 873.82]  Amen.
[883.82 --> 896.82]  Savior and Savior, Lord, is the God in the dark, in the dark in Jerusalem.
[896.82 --> 910.52]  Hold on the praise, to the blood and blood, as the angels are at, as it's written.
[912.52 --> 924.52]  Sing our salvation, love, God in love, all in faith, in and sacrifice.
[926.82 --> 937.32]  Fulfilled in once above, for he lives, as his result from the dead.
[942.42 --> 956.48]  See, Mary will be, where is he laid, as he's so cold, she turns from the empty tomb.
[956.82 --> 970.32]  He is the voice speaking, calling her name, is the master, the Lord, is to life again.
[970.32 --> 984.32]  The voice that spends the years, speaking high, swearing low, making peace to us.
[984.32 --> 997.04]  He'll sound till he appears, for he lives, as his result from the dead.
[997.04 --> 1011.04]  Come with the Father, angels and kings, goodness me.
[1011.04 --> 1015.04]  Let him close, with the certainty.
[1017.04 --> 1024.72]  Honor and mercy, glory and praise to the name.
[1024.72 --> 1029.72]  Lord, Lord, of God, of God, of God, of God, of God.
[1029.72 --> 1031.72]  Lord, of God, of God, of God, of God, of God, of God, of God, of God.
[1031.72 --> 1043.72]  And we are with him, in his death, mouth has come, once as God.
[1043.72 --> 1055.72]  And we shall win, in his death, for he lives, Christ is risen from the dead.
[1055.72 --> 1073.94]  All right, the cross looks very nice.
[1073.94 --> 1085.74]  So, friends, on this morning, of all mornings, we should be so very confident in the grace of confession.
[1086.84 --> 1092.04]  Jesus Christ has died and he has risen to cover all of our sins.
[1092.04 --> 1100.18]  So, follow with me, as we confess our sins before him, using the words of Psalm 130.
[1100.96 --> 1105.82]  Then I will give you a minute of silence to come before him in confession.
[1106.58 --> 1108.80]  So, please, let's read this responsibly together.
[1109.80 --> 1111.36]  Lord, hear my voice.
[1112.40 --> 1115.80]  Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
[1115.80 --> 1122.62]  If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[1123.86 --> 1128.84]  But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can with reverence serve you.
[1130.08 --> 1136.88]  I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
[1137.50 --> 1144.96]  I wait for the Lord, more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.
[1145.80 --> 1153.80]  Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption.
[1155.18 --> 1159.74]  He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[1160.48 --> 1163.48]  And, Lord, hear our silent confessions before you now.
[1175.80 --> 1187.30]  Friends, our Lord Jesus has had mercy on us, for Christ, who died, lives again.
[1188.56 --> 1194.30]  And so, after confessing our sins to God, we look to Jesus, and we receive his words of pardon.
[1194.30 --> 1199.68]  So, hear these words of pardon now from 1 Peter 1, verse 3.
[1200.64 --> 1203.96]  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1204.82 --> 1211.86]  According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[1211.86 --> 1216.40]  through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[1216.74 --> 1217.08]  Amen.
[1218.04 --> 1218.96]  Let's stand.
[1219.10 --> 1221.26]  Let's sing together the song, Living Hope.
[1221.26 --> 1240.26]  How great the castle that lay between us.
[1240.26 --> 1246.48]  How high the mountain I could not climb.
[1246.48 --> 1253.32]  In desperation I turned to heaven.
[1253.48 --> 1259.48]  It's glory, it's glory, it's glory, it's glory, it's glory, it's glory.
[1259.48 --> 1266.58]  And through the darkness, the love and kindness,
[1267.02 --> 1272.14]  all through the shadows of my soul.
[1272.14 --> 1285.14]  The world is made, the world is written, Jesus Christ, the living hope.
[1285.14 --> 1295.74]  Can you imagine the kingdom so great of mercy?
[1297.14 --> 1302.92]  But from whom the color is in a lifetime, such love is placed,
[1303.68 --> 1309.02]  it's all in ages, it's destorned from glory.
[1309.02 --> 1315.76]  To bear my sin and bear my shame
[1315.76 --> 1322.18]  In words not spoken, I am forgiven
[1322.18 --> 1328.76]  The King of kings calls me his home
[1328.76 --> 1335.46]  He did forsaken my heart forever
[1335.46 --> 1342.40]  Jesus Christ is my living Lord
[1342.40 --> 1349.80]  Hallelujah, praise the one who sent me free
[1349.80 --> 1356.30]  Hallelujah, death has lost its breath on me
[1356.30 --> 1359.62]  You are broken and been changed
[1359.62 --> 1362.76]  This new wish of your name
[1362.76 --> 1368.70]  Jesus Christ is my living Lord
[1368.70 --> 1379.26]  And gave the glory, blessed by promise
[1379.26 --> 1385.92]  For every body he danced to me
[1385.92 --> 1391.86]  The warmest silence, the roaring lion
[1391.86 --> 1394.80]  Did let them be of faith windows
[1394.80 --> 1399.80]  Did let them appear, was never made by me
[1399.80 --> 1402.60]  You are broken and mourning
[1402.60 --> 1403.76]  You are broken and mourning
[1403.76 --> 1404.62]  Yes, you are broken and made by me
[1404.62 --> 1407.80]  Your very body began to hear
[1407.80 --> 1413.32]  Everybody begin to hear
[1413.32 --> 1419.94]  Out of the silence, the roaring fire
[1419.94 --> 1426.50]  Deep weather came as no flame on Him
[1426.50 --> 1432.94]  Jesus, God, sing the name of Him
[1432.94 --> 1441.16]  Alleluia, praise the one who's still been free
[1441.16 --> 1447.68]  Alleluia, the hands of sins will obey
[1447.68 --> 1451.18]  You are broken and finished in
[1451.18 --> 1454.32]  The salvation in glory
[1454.32 --> 1459.90]  Jesus, God, my living hope
[1459.90 --> 1467.96]  Alleluia, praise the one who's still been free
[1467.96 --> 1474.46]  Alleluia, the hands of sins will obey
[1474.46 --> 1477.94]  You are broken and finished in
[1477.94 --> 1481.20]  The salvation in your name
[1481.20 --> 1487.46]  Jesus, God, my living hope
[1487.46 --> 1494.20]  Jesus, God, my living hope
[1494.20 --> 1499.18]  Amen
[1499.18 --> 1522.30]  So it is a joy today
[1522.30 --> 1526.72]  To baptize these brothers and sisters
[1526.72 --> 1529.52]  And to receive them into Christ's church
[1529.52 --> 1533.08]  So, I'm going to
[1533.08 --> 1537.50]  Nancy gets wired up here
[1537.50 --> 1538.16]  Yeah
[1538.16 --> 1539.52]  Alright, here she is
[1539.52 --> 1541.44]  Come on up
[1541.44 --> 1544.86]  And all of you, yeah, you can all come up here
[1544.86 --> 1545.18]  Okay
[1545.18 --> 1549.04]  So while you're coming up
[1549.04 --> 1551.02]  I will continue our introduction
[1551.02 --> 1552.14]  Alright
[1552.14 --> 1553.28]  Ready again?
[1554.02 --> 1555.54]  So, brothers and sisters
[1555.54 --> 1557.46]  Hear these words from the Apostle Paul
[1557.46 --> 1560.22]  Do you not know
[1560.22 --> 1561.44]  That all of us
[1561.44 --> 1563.70]  Who have been baptized into Christ
[1563.70 --> 1566.08]  Were baptized into His death?
[1566.94 --> 1569.04]  Therefore, we have been buried with Him
[1569.04 --> 1570.56]  By baptism into death
[1570.56 --> 1573.68]  So that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[1573.68 --> 1575.00]  By the glory of the Father
[1575.00 --> 1578.04]  So we too might walk in newness of life
[1578.04 --> 1591.18]  Joy toドام
[1591.18 --> 1592.44]  Let's do that
[1592.44 --> 1594.74]  is受洗归入他的死吗
[1594.74 --> 1598.24] 所以我们借着洗礼归入死
[1598.24 --> 1600.18] 是和他一同埋葬
[1600.18 --> 1602.38] 原是叫我们一举一动
[1602.38 --> 1603.96] 有心生的样式
[1603.96 --> 1606.98] 像基督借着父的荣耀
[1606.98 --> 1608.88] 从死里复活一样
[1608.88 --> 1612.10]  and the Lord Jesus also said this
[1612.10 --> 1614.70]  go therefore and make disciples
[1614.70 --> 1615.76]  of all the nations
[1615.76 --> 1618.32]  baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1618.32 --> 1620.34]  and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
[1620.34 --> 1623.04] 主耶稣也这样说
[1623.04 --> 1624.76] 所以你们要去
[1624.76 --> 1627.00] 使万民做我的门徒
[1627.00 --> 1629.36] 奉父子圣灵的名
[1629.36 --> 1630.48] 给他们施洗
[1630.48 --> 1632.20]  and so in obedience
[1632.20 --> 1633.66]  to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1633.66 --> 1635.84]  the church baptizes
[1635.84 --> 1638.28]  those who have put their faith in him
[1638.28 --> 1640.08]  for forgiveness of sins
[1640.08 --> 1642.16]  and for the gift of salvation
[1642.16 --> 1645.08] 所以为了顺服耶稣基督
[1645.08 --> 1648.48] 教会会那些相信他的人施洗
[1648.48 --> 1650.08] 以使罪得赦免
[1650.08 --> 1652.42] 并获得救恩的恩赐
[1652.42 --> 1654.68]  and so what is baptism all about?
[1656.68 --> 1657.10]  baptism
[1657.10 --> 1657.72]  sorry
[1657.72 --> 1660.50]  we didn't practice this
[1660.50 --> 1662.80]  what is baptism?
[1662.92 --> 1664.90]  baptism is a sign and seal
[1664.90 --> 1666.40]  of God's promises
[1666.40 --> 1668.48]  to his covenant people
[1668.48 --> 1670.38] 什么是洗礼呢?
[1670.88 --> 1671.78] 洗礼就是神
[1671.78 --> 1673.92] 对那些与他立约的子民
[1673.92 --> 1676.46] 所应许的标志和印记
[1676.46 --> 1677.76]  in baptism
[1677.76 --> 1678.64]  God promises
[1678.64 --> 1679.80]  by grace alone
[1679.80 --> 1681.52]  to forgive our sins
[1681.52 --> 1683.88]  to adopt us into his body
[1683.88 --> 1684.98]  the church
[1684.98 --> 1687.30]  to send the Holy Spirit daily
[1687.30 --> 1689.16]  to renew and to cleanse us
[1689.16 --> 1690.60]  and then finally
[1690.60 --> 1691.74]  to resurrect us
[1691.74 --> 1692.72]  to eternal life
[1692.72 --> 1694.80]  in the洗礼中
[1694.80 --> 1696.90] 上帝应许之
[1696.90 --> 1698.12] 他的恩典
[1698.12 --> 1699.98] 来赦免我们的罪
[1699.98 --> 1701.66] 并且收养我们
[1701.66 --> 1703.62] 进入耶稣基督的身体
[1703.62 --> 1705.04] 进入他的教会
[1705.04 --> 1706.70] 而且每天派圣灵
[1706.70 --> 1708.68] 来更新和洁净我们
[1708.68 --> 1711.26] 使我们可以有复活的盼望
[1711.26 --> 1712.16] 直到永生
[1712.16 --> 1714.42]  and all these promises
[1714.42 --> 1716.98]  they are made visible to us
[1716.98 --> 1719.10]  in these waters of baptism
[1719.10 --> 1721.48]  so just as water
[1721.48 --> 1723.08]  cleanses us
[1723.08 --> 1724.40]  it purifies us
[1724.40 --> 1726.36]  and it sustains life
[1726.36 --> 1728.54]  you know Jesus Christ came
[1728.54 --> 1729.40]  and he said
[1729.40 --> 1733.12]  I am the true and living water
[1733.12 --> 1735.52]  and so through faith in him
[1735.52 --> 1736.72]  just like this water
[1736.72 --> 1738.44]  we are cleansed of our sin
[1738.44 --> 1741.02]  and we are given new life in him
[1741.02 --> 1742.62]  so this
[1742.62 --> 1744.74] 应许呢
[1744.74 --> 1746.38]  is in洗礼当中
[1746.38 --> 1747.60]  in洗礼的水中
[1747.60 --> 1748.38] 展显出来
[1748.38 --> 1749.58] 正如水可以
[1749.58 --> 1750.40] 清洁
[1750.40 --> 1751.06] 净化
[1751.06 --> 1751.90] 更新
[1751.90 --> 1753.58] 和维持我们的生命
[1753.58 --> 1754.98] 耶稣基督
[1754.98 --> 1755.92] 是真正的
[1755.92 --> 1756.96] 生命的活水
[1756.96 --> 1758.62] 因着对他的信心
[1758.62 --> 1759.62] 我们的罪
[1759.62 --> 1760.66] 得以洁净
[1760.66 --> 1761.72] 并获得
[1761.72 --> 1762.78] 新的生命
[1762.78 --> 1765.10]  so
[1765.10 --> 1766.14]  brothers and sisters
[1766.14 --> 1768.68]  you have responded
[1768.68 --> 1769.74]  to God's grace
[1769.74 --> 1770.40]  in your lives
[1770.40 --> 1771.68]  you have decided
[1771.68 --> 1774.32]  that you want to put your faith in Christ
[1774.32 --> 1776.30]  that you want to follow him
[1776.30 --> 1777.86]  so now therefore
[1777.86 --> 1778.82]  I ask you
[1778.82 --> 1780.34]  to profess your faith
[1780.34 --> 1781.12]  before God
[1781.12 --> 1782.74]  and before all of us here
[1782.74 --> 1803.80]  so I will ask you
[1803.80 --> 1805.36]  the vows
[1805.36 --> 1807.64]  that you are to take
[1807.64 --> 1808.16]  okay
[1808.16 --> 1810.22]  so first
[1810.22 --> 1810.98]  do you
[1810.98 --> 1811.80]  renounce
[1811.80 --> 1812.40]  sin
[1812.40 --> 1813.82]  and the power of evil
[1813.82 --> 1814.60]  in your life
[1814.60 --> 1815.78]  and in the world
[1815.78 --> 1845.76]  you want to

[1846.72 --> 1848.42]  and showing his love
[1848.42 --> 1849.54]  as long as you will live
[1849.54 --> 1879.52]  you want to

[1896.64 --> 1897.80]  and this is a vow
[1897.80 --> 1898.48]  where you
[1898.48 --> 1899.96]  before God
[1899.96 --> 1900.22]  say
[1900.22 --> 1900.88]  I will

[2490.46 --> 2516.96]  So this is Stephanie, and her verse is 2 Peter 3, verse 9.
[2516.96 --> 2522.34]  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness.
[2523.20 --> 2530.60]  Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
[2538.54 --> 2544.30]  Stephanie, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2544.30 --> 2544.96]  Amen.
[2546.96 --> 2552.22]  I'm Michael.
[2552.96 --> 2555.42]  Yue Bo Gi, 10章, 12.
[2555.42 --> 2558.48]  Ni jang shenming h zi ai zi ge wo.
[2558.68 --> 2560.68]  Ni je jen gu, bao chuan wode shingling.
[2563.16 --> 2566.42]  Now, Michael's verse is Job, chapter 10, verse 12.
[2566.42 --> 2573.58]  You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence, watched over my spirit.
[2573.58 --> 2585.48]  Michael, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2586.32 --> 2586.60]  Amen.
[2587.10 --> 2587.50]  Amen.
[2587.50 --> 2595.14]  Switch the other side here.
[2595.14 --> 2595.96]  There.
[2595.96 --> 2596.50]  Jai er.
[2596.50 --> 2597.22]  Okay.
[2597.22 --> 2603.68]  I'm Jenny.
[2603.68 --> 2605.68]  I'm Jenny.
[2605.68 --> 2606.68]  I'm Jenny.
[2606.68 --> 2607.14]  I'm Jenny.
[2607.14 --> 2608.14]  You ar.
[2608.14 --> 2609.14] draw.
[2609.14 --> 2610.14]  Если и д cosm, давая заし God assim корова.
[2610.14 --> 2611.48]  Your body così gestures, and to the Yellowstone.
[2611.48 --> 2612.64]  I need you to fix it then.
[2612.64 --> 2616.68]  If you have in the darkness, you will be able to ask you.
[2617.22 --> 2620.06]  Mark 2, verse 6, verse 3, verse 4.
[2624.42 --> 2627.46]  So, Jenny's verse is Matthew 6, verses 3 to 4.
[2628.14 --> 2632.42]  But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
[2633.00 --> 2634.52]  so that your giving may be in secret.
[2635.22 --> 2639.06]  Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
[2642.64 --> 2652.12]  Jenny, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2652.76 --> 2652.98]  Amen.
[2652.98 --> 2653.98]  Amen.
[2661.36 --> 2662.36]  I'm Scott.
[2662.36 --> 2688.66]  So, Scott's verse is Philippians chapter 4, verse 6 and 7.
[2688.66 --> 2697.76]  Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your request to God.
[2698.54 --> 2704.78]  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[2705.98 --> 2706.42]  Amen.
[2711.94 --> 2716.86]  Scott, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2716.86 --> 2717.90]  Amen.
[2717.90 --> 2718.04]  Amen.
[2718.40 --> 2718.90]  Amen.
[2718.90 --> 2719.04]  Amen.
[2728.04 --> 2728.60]  Right.
[2728.84 --> 2730.38]  So, the declaration.
[2731.24 --> 2736.24]  In the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord, the King, and the head of the church,
[2736.92 --> 2741.06]  these children of God are now received into the visible membership of Christ's church,
[2741.58 --> 2744.34]  and engaged to be Christ's faithful disciples.
[2745.12 --> 2745.98]  Let us pray.
[2746.46 --> 2747.04]  Go ahead.
[2747.04 --> 2748.04]  Go ahead.
[2748.04 --> 2750.02]  Thank you.
[2762.52 --> 2763.72]  Thank you.
[2763.72 --> 2769.66]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you make us new creations in Jesus Christ through your grace alone.
[2771.30 --> 2777.86]  Bless, strengthen these, your children, daily by your grace and by your love.
[2778.96 --> 2780.88]  Father, would you deepen their faith?
[2781.70 --> 2783.52]  Would you keep them from the power of evil?
[2784.42 --> 2791.24]  Would you enable them to grow up into the image of Christ as his disciples until your kingdom comes?
[2791.24 --> 2793.12]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2794.16 --> 2801.46] 仁慈的天父上帝,我们感谢你,因着你的恩典,在基督耶稣里重生了我们.
[2802.40 --> 2813.38] 求你,每天用你的爱和恩典来祝福,来使我们能够信仰,信心得以加深,有远离邪恶的力量,
[2813.80 --> 2821.24] 使我们能够成为耶稣基督忠实的门徒,直到你的国度降临,奉耶稣基督的名.
[2821.24 --> 2822.20] Amen.
[2822.20 --> 2825.66]  And at this time, let's give praise to God.
[2828.52 --> 2829.94] 给上帝讲声
[2829.94 --> 2837.52]  All right, so we're going to pass out baptism certificates and take a quick photo,
[2837.80 --> 2840.80]  and everyone can get ready to stand and sing.
[2840.80 --> 2841.08]  Enjoy.
[2841.26 --> 2841.80]  Enjoy.
[2841.80 --> 2843.12]  Enjoy.
[2843.12 --> 2873.10]  Thank you.
[2873.10 --> 2874.28]  Okay, great.
[2875.28 --> 2876.04]  Thank you all.
[2876.14 --> 2877.04]  You can return to your seat.
[2877.04 --> 2877.66]  Thank you.
[2881.66 --> 2885.76]  Let's all stand and we'll sing In Christ Alone.
[2885.76 --> 2898.62]  Let's all stand and we'll sing in Christ alone.
[2898.62 --> 2903.28]  He is my heart, my strength, my soul, my soul.
[2903.28 --> 2920.72]  He's God, my soul, and his soul, and love.
[2920.72 --> 2925.36]  Down to the priest's birth and star
[2925.36 --> 2930.38]  Our hearts are humbled as a beat
[2930.38 --> 2935.44]  When fears are still with serving seas
[2935.44 --> 2940.90]  Our comforter, our only Lord
[2940.90 --> 2944.86]  Here in the cup of night's death
[2950.72 --> 2960.50]  In Christ alone, the tongue of flesh
[2960.50 --> 2965.08]  Fawn as the running help is clear
[2965.08 --> 2970.44]  His beautiful love, the righteous midst
[2970.44 --> 2975.04]  Star by the bonds He came to sin
[2975.04 --> 2980.16]  In all that cross of Jesus' hand
[2980.16 --> 2985.22]  The one of God who's satisfied
[2985.22 --> 2990.94]  For every sin I will take
[2990.94 --> 2995.16]  In the cup of life's ideal
[2995.16 --> 3005.94]  In the cup of life's ideal
[3005.94 --> 3010.16]  In the cup of life's ideal
[3010.16 --> 3015.30]  Light of the world by darkness slain
[3015.30 --> 3016.30]  In the cup of life's ideal
[3016.30 --> 3020.30]  In the cup of life's ideal
[3020.30 --> 3024.08]  Out from the heavenly rosary
[3024.08 --> 3029.30]  And as He's left in victory
[3029.30 --> 3034.36]  Six verses, watch his good morning
[3034.36 --> 3037.38]  You undisputed by the Haben
[3037.38 --> 3041.36]  This way He's left in victory
[3041.36 --> 3047.34]  In the cup of life's ideal
[3047.34 --> 3048.34]  Amen.
[3077.34 --> 3078.34]  Amen.
[3107.34 --> 3109.16]  You may be seated.
[3110.20 --> 3115.14]  And may I invite the children to come and join me for a moment down here in front.
[3118.80 --> 3119.58]  Excuse me.
[3121.32 --> 3121.68]  Okay.
[3121.94 --> 3122.10]  Okay.
[3123.54 --> 3124.18]  Thank you.
[3124.24 --> 3124.50]  Thank you.
[3124.74 --> 3125.08]  Okay.
[3125.60 --> 3126.08]  All right.
[3126.08 --> 3137.64]  Come and have a seat.
[3144.42 --> 3145.14]  She wouldn't come.
[3145.24 --> 3145.52]  That's okay.
[3149.46 --> 3149.78]  Okay.
[3150.26 --> 3150.70]  Have a seat.
[3150.76 --> 3151.12]  Have a seat.
[3152.02 --> 3152.38]  Okay.
[3153.00 --> 3154.56]  So I want to show you all something.
[3155.34 --> 3155.58]  Hey, guys.
[3155.58 --> 3156.06]  Come over here.
[3156.88 --> 3157.06]  Yeah.
[3157.28 --> 3157.64]  All right.
[3157.68 --> 3157.84]  Yeah.
[3157.84 --> 3158.10]  Thanks.
[3158.98 --> 3159.32]  Come on.
[3159.38 --> 3159.78]  Have a seat.
[3159.86 --> 3160.18]  Have a seat.
[3161.62 --> 3161.94]  All right.
[3162.36 --> 3163.64]  I want to show you my box.
[3164.70 --> 3165.42]  Have you ever seen my box?
[3165.70 --> 3167.06]  It's made out of wood, walnut.
[3167.82 --> 3169.50]  And I keep this in my bedroom.
[3170.06 --> 3171.88]  And I put some things in it.
[3171.88 --> 3172.54]  You know what I put in there?
[3173.10 --> 3174.68]  I put money.
[3176.28 --> 3176.68]  Yeah.
[3177.18 --> 3182.94]  And my passport and some coins from different countries.
[3182.94 --> 3186.08]  And I have a pocket knife I keep in there.
[3186.68 --> 3187.94]  Some guitar picks.
[3189.06 --> 3189.72]  What else?
[3190.62 --> 3191.54]  Buttons, I think.
[3191.90 --> 3193.46]  I have lots of different stuff in there.
[3194.00 --> 3195.22]  So I'm going to show you, okay?
[3195.22 --> 3195.86]  You do.
[3195.86 --> 3195.90]  You do.
[3195.90 --> 3199.98]  You do.
[3200.14 --> 3200.32]  Yeah.
[3200.64 --> 3200.88]  Okay.
[3201.14 --> 3201.78]  So this is my box.
[3201.82 --> 3202.64]  I'm going to show you what's inside.
[3202.74 --> 3205.10]  Now, when you look, don't tell anybody.
[3205.48 --> 3206.92]  Keep it a secret what you see in there.
[3207.10 --> 3207.44]  Are you ready?
[3208.30 --> 3208.48]  Okay.
[3208.48 --> 3209.24]  I'm going to show a couple of you.
[3209.34 --> 3209.44]  Ready?
[3209.60 --> 3210.50]  You guys over here, look.
[3210.60 --> 3211.14]  Don't say anything.
[3211.34 --> 3211.56]  Don't say anything.
[3213.90 --> 3214.26]  Okay.
[3214.40 --> 3214.92]  You all see?
[3216.46 --> 3216.82]  Shh.
[3217.38 --> 3218.38]  Do you all see what's in there?
[3220.44 --> 3221.02]  What's in there?
[3221.10 --> 3221.46]  What do you see?
[3222.52 --> 3222.70]  Shh.
[3223.02 --> 3223.22]  Shh.
[3223.48 --> 3224.08]  What do you see?
[3226.36 --> 3227.08]  What do you all see?
[3227.94 --> 3228.14]  Okay.
[3228.30 --> 3228.54]  All right.
[3228.60 --> 3230.40]  Now, tell everybody here what's in there.
[3230.66 --> 3230.98]  Nothing.
[3231.34 --> 3231.64]  Nothing.
[3232.20 --> 3232.48]  Nothing.
[3233.28 --> 3234.98]  It's black, fluffy paper.
[3235.34 --> 3236.02]  It's empty.
[3236.40 --> 3237.24]  With black, fluffy paper.
[3237.24 --> 3238.18]  With black, fluffy paper.
[3238.30 --> 3239.04]  But it's empty, yeah.
[3239.82 --> 3240.96]  And that's surprising, right?
[3240.98 --> 3244.70]  I told you all the things in there, and you expected to see some money and some coins.
[3244.96 --> 3246.24]  I expected to see nothing.
[3246.82 --> 3249.18]  Well, you're messing up my illustration.
[3249.52 --> 3249.68]  Okay.
[3250.22 --> 3255.46]  But maybe you expected all these things in there, but actually, look, and it was empty.
[3256.24 --> 3258.06]  Well, today is Easter.
[3258.82 --> 3263.64]  And on Easter, we remember that there was something else that was empty.
[3264.18 --> 3265.90]  People were expecting it to be full.
[3266.04 --> 3266.22]  Hi.
[3266.22 --> 3268.22]  I have chocolate egg.
[3268.38 --> 3269.18]  You have chocolate egg?
[3269.18 --> 3269.64]  There we are.
[3270.64 --> 3271.12]  Okay.
[3272.38 --> 3272.90]  Yeah.
[3274.80 --> 3275.86]  The tomb.
[3276.00 --> 3276.26]  Yeah.
[3276.44 --> 3277.20]  The tomb.
[3277.70 --> 3280.40]  Jesus died, and they buried him in a tomb.
[3281.12 --> 3281.76]  That's right.
[3281.82 --> 3282.50]  For our sins.
[3283.04 --> 3284.96]  And the women, there were two Marys.
[3285.04 --> 3285.80]  They're both named Mary.
[3285.92 --> 3286.64]  Mary and Mary.
[3287.24 --> 3292.54]  They went to the tomb, and they were expecting to find Jesus dead in the tomb.
[3292.54 --> 3295.26]  But they went, and it was what?
[3296.16 --> 3296.64]  Empty.
[3297.08 --> 3298.12]  So let me read for you.
[3298.48 --> 3299.88]  Matthew chapter 28.
[3299.88 --> 3307.84]  After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look in the tomb.
[3307.84 --> 3310.68]  There was a violent earthquake.
[3310.68 --> 3310.70]  There was a violent earthquake.
[3310.70 --> 3311.24]  Right?
[3311.24 --> 3312.36]  Right?
[3312.42 --> 3312.66]  Rumbling.
[3312.66 --> 3313.20]  Right?
[3313.20 --> 3313.26]  Rumbling.
[3313.26 --> 3316.46]  And an angel of the Lord came down from heaven.
[3316.46 --> 3320.74]  And going to the tomb, he rolled back the stone and sat on top of it.
[3320.74 --> 3323.78]  His appearance was like lightning.
[3323.94 --> 3325.48]  His clothes were white as snow.
[3325.86 --> 3333.32]  The guards who were guarding the tomb, they were so afraid that they shook and became like dead men.
[3334.80 --> 3340.52]  The angel said to the women, do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who is crucified.
[3341.00 --> 3342.08]  He is not here.
[3342.44 --> 3344.72]  He has risen, just as he said.
[3345.26 --> 3347.80]  Come and see the place where he lie.
[3347.80 --> 3350.76]  So the angel said, look, it's empty.
[3351.32 --> 3352.24]  And he showed us.
[3352.28 --> 3358.40]  He rolled back the tomb, the stone, and he showed Mary and Mary and the women that the tomb was empty.
[3358.64 --> 3359.50]  Because Jesus is risen.
[3362.30 --> 3363.26]  Yeah, her friend's name was Mary.
[3363.58 --> 3363.78]  Okay.
[3365.00 --> 3366.36]  So, can you remember that?
[3366.46 --> 3367.86]  So on Easter, what do we remember?
[3368.42 --> 3370.70]  The tomb was empty.
[3371.36 --> 3371.64]  Okay?
[3371.96 --> 3372.58]  Nothing in there.
[3372.92 --> 3373.70]  Jesus rose.
[3374.28 --> 3374.48]  Yeah.
[3375.00 --> 3375.68]  Let's pray.
[3375.68 --> 3380.68]  Father, we thank you that this Easter we remember that you rose from the dead.
[3380.80 --> 3381.66]  The tomb is empty.
[3382.24 --> 3384.06]  And that means that we have life in you.
[3384.86 --> 3388.04]  Lord, we thank you for the life that you give us when we put our trust in you.
[3388.36 --> 3389.54]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3389.70 --> 3390.00]  Amen.
[3390.84 --> 3391.24]  All right.
[3391.28 --> 3391.70]  Thank you.
[3392.52 --> 3393.52]  You can go back to your seats.
[3393.70 --> 3396.62]  And if you are age three to kindergarten, you can go to your class.
[3397.34 --> 3397.56]  Okay?
[3397.64 --> 3402.08]  And our Chinese friends, you are free to go to the fireside room.
[3403.92 --> 3404.46]  Fireside room.
[3404.46 --> 3404.74]  Yeah.
[3405.68 --> 3406.06]  All right.
[3406.12 --> 3406.74]  You guys ready to go?
[3406.74 --> 3436.72]  Thank you.
[3436.74 --> 3466.72]  Thank you.
[3466.74 --> 3468.74]  Thank you.
[3496.74 --> 3498.74]  Thank you.
[3498.74 --> 3500.74]  Thank you.
[3500.74 --> 3530.74] 
[3530.74 --> 3532.74]  Thank you.
[3532.74 --> 3534.74]  Thank you.
[3534.74 --> 3536.74]  Thank you.
[3536.74 --> 3538.74]  Thank you, God.
[3538.74 --> 3540.74]  Thank you, God.
[3540.74 --> 3542.74]  Thank you, God.
[3542.74 --> 3550.74]  Thank you, God.
[3550.74 --> 3552.74]  All right.
[3552.74 --> 3554.84]  So I think I'm still using this microphone, right?
[3555.50 --> 3556.36]  Is this a better microphone?
[3557.44 --> 3557.90]  Doesn't matter.
[3558.08 --> 3558.42]  Okay.
[3562.68 --> 3563.96]  Let's pray together.
[3565.82 --> 3570.06]  Our Father in heaven, we thank you that you have gathered us this Easter morning
[3570.06 --> 3574.84]  to reflect on the wonder that our God, the creator of the universe,
[3575.24 --> 3581.06]  not only suffered death on a cross, but then on the third day rose again victorious over sin and death.
[3581.06 --> 3590.40]  And so we pray that, Lord, by the Holy Spirit, you would stir our hearts and our minds to ponder these things,
[3590.94 --> 3596.88]  that we would be filled with wonder and joy at the salvation that you have given to us in Jesus.
[3597.74 --> 3600.22]  And it is in his name we pray now.
[3600.86 --> 3601.22]  Amen.
[3602.54 --> 3608.90]  So if you have been with us for the last several weeks, we have been going through the book of Malachi.
[3608.90 --> 3612.60]  And this, today, is the conclusion of our series.
[3613.32 --> 3618.68]  We, in fact, are looking at the very last chapter in the entire Old Testament.
[3619.88 --> 3623.90]  These are the last words before Jesus came.
[3625.20 --> 3629.88]  So to prepare us for what Malachi has to say to us this morning,
[3630.32 --> 3633.58]  I want to tell you about a song that I heard about.
[3633.58 --> 3638.48]  It's a song that is called When Love Was King.
[3640.04 --> 3646.48]  It's a song written by a jazz musician and singer by the name of Gregory Porter.
[3647.20 --> 3651.92]  And in this song, he talks all about what he deems the world could be
[3651.92 --> 3657.16]  and what it should be when love rules as king.
[3657.16 --> 3660.52]  Have you heard of Gregory Porter, by any chance?
[3661.02 --> 3661.56]  I'm not sure.
[3661.62 --> 3661.74]  Okay.
[3662.80 --> 3666.64]  So, yeah, I listen to a lot of jazz, but this song caught my eye.
[3666.72 --> 3671.30]  So let me read some of the lyrics to this song, When Love Is King.
[3671.38 --> 3674.34]  And, you know, I consider singing it to you.
[3676.44 --> 3678.46]  But he has such a beautiful voice.
[3678.90 --> 3680.86]  And me singing would make you want to leave.
[3681.24 --> 3682.46]  So I want you to stay.
[3682.62 --> 3683.68]  So I'm just going to read it.
[3684.58 --> 3685.34]  Here it is.
[3685.34 --> 3689.60]  This is the story when love was king.
[3690.38 --> 3692.40]  When love was king, do you remember?
[3693.36 --> 3694.64]  When love was king.
[3694.72 --> 3695.84]  When love was king.
[3696.14 --> 3697.88]  I remember when love was king.
[3698.62 --> 3702.30]  He ruled the land with his fist unfurled.
[3702.90 --> 3704.64]  With open arms for the world.
[3705.52 --> 3709.34]  Of hungry children, first he'd think to pull their lives from the brink.
[3709.34 --> 3711.42]  When love was king.
[3711.42 --> 3714.24]  When love was king, he rescued souls lost in the sea.
[3715.10 --> 3717.20]  In drifting vessel, he would hear their plea.
[3717.60 --> 3719.48]  He threw a line before they'd sink.
[3719.86 --> 3721.52]  And gave the thirsty ones a drink.
[3722.52 --> 3726.30]  When love was king, he showed respect for every man.
[3726.86 --> 3729.04]  Regardless of their skin or clam.
[3729.04 --> 3731.84]  Beside him stood his mighty queen.
[3731.84 --> 3734.46]  In equal force, wise and keen.
[3735.38 --> 3737.06]  He lifted up the underneath.
[3737.96 --> 3740.18]  And all of his wealth he did bequeath.
[3740.68 --> 3742.90]  To those who toiled without a gain.
[3743.40 --> 3745.00]  So they would remember his reign.
[3746.24 --> 3748.44]  So seek some place to call your own.
[3748.44 --> 3751.28]  Right next to his mighty throne.
[3752.08 --> 3753.22]  When love was king.
[3753.90 --> 3755.24]  When love was king.
[3756.68 --> 3766.22]  See, in this song, he looks back and talks about all that was right with the world when love was king.
[3766.80 --> 3768.72]  Love fed the hungry.
[3769.48 --> 3770.98]  Love rescued the lost.
[3771.32 --> 3772.88]  Love showed dignity to all people.
[3773.16 --> 3774.58]  And he lifted up the downtrodden.
[3774.58 --> 3782.48]  But this song also anticipates and looks forward to a day when love will be king again.
[3783.60 --> 3788.62]  And he is so sure that love will be king again that he says to all of his listeners,
[3789.46 --> 3791.62]  Seek some place to call your own.
[3792.14 --> 3795.72]  Right next to his mighty shining throne.
[3797.64 --> 3799.64]  Well, in a very similar way,
[3799.64 --> 3806.96]  This is how Malachi concludes his message to the Israelites and to us as well.
[3807.64 --> 3811.02]  The Israelites, God's people back in the Old Testament times,
[3811.24 --> 3814.76]  They remember a time when God was king.
[3815.36 --> 3818.84]  When God's love reigned among his people.
[3819.14 --> 3821.04]  And everything was as it should be.
[3822.00 --> 3824.98]  But as they now look around at their circumstances,
[3825.56 --> 3827.72]  That hadn't been their experience.
[3827.72 --> 3834.28]  And their disappointment at what they thought was God's unfaithfulness to them
[3834.28 --> 3837.80]  Was a root cause of all of their unfaithfulness.
[3838.66 --> 3841.32]  Their hope had begun to spoil.
[3842.92 --> 3846.44]  So they were just less faithful to God.
[3847.12 --> 3851.32]  And they were more unfaithful to one another.
[3851.32 --> 3855.16]  So through the prophet Malachi,
[3855.90 --> 3858.24]  God spoke to his people.
[3858.42 --> 3860.38]  And his final words to them,
[3860.90 --> 3864.24]  As he begins again to reassure them.
[3865.16 --> 3867.20]  Though they have had so much drama,
[3868.12 --> 3872.30]  Though there were so many issues that God had to deal with with his people,
[3872.88 --> 3875.88]  That they would return to him in their hearts and in their lives,
[3875.88 --> 3880.12]  He loves them and he wants to leave them with a picture of hope.
[3880.76 --> 3884.14]  And that picture of hope is that the day that they long for,
[3884.46 --> 3888.76]  This day that they anticipate when the world will be put right again,
[3888.86 --> 3892.16]  That day, Malachi says, is surely coming.
[3893.24 --> 3894.22]  Malachi says to them,
[3894.26 --> 3897.86]  And he says it as like a father to a son who is downtrodden.
[3897.92 --> 3899.08]  He lifts up his chin.
[3899.08 --> 3901.10]  And he says that day is coming,
[3901.48 --> 3903.50]  And now put your hope in that day.
[3904.08 --> 3909.06]  And you must order your lives around what is to come.
[3910.38 --> 3912.02]  And so in our text this morning,
[3912.52 --> 3914.26]  Malachi tells them that the world,
[3914.74 --> 3916.32]  He tells them what the world will be like
[3916.32 --> 3921.08]  On the day when God's king shows up to set the world right.
[3922.06 --> 3923.08]  And we're going to focus today,
[3923.88 --> 3927.04]  We only have time to focus on the first two verses of our text.
[3927.04 --> 3929.14]  And there are two things I want us to see here
[3929.14 --> 3932.44]  That characterize that day.
[3932.98 --> 3935.48]  That day that the people of God long for,
[3935.56 --> 3938.02]  The new exodus of freedom and joy.
[3938.56 --> 3940.20]  When all things will be put right.
[3941.32 --> 3942.82]  And this is what he says first,
[3942.92 --> 3944.06]  That it will be a day of judgment.
[3945.42 --> 3947.46]  So first, when that day comes,
[3947.52 --> 3951.88]  It will be a day of judgment for the arrogant and the evil doers.
[3952.10 --> 3953.08]  So look at verse 1.
[3954.46 --> 3955.86]  Surely the day is coming.
[3957.04 --> 3959.88]  Surely, just as the tide comes in,
[3960.72 --> 3961.94]  Surely that day is coming.
[3962.72 --> 3964.64]  It will burn like a furnace.
[3965.02 --> 3968.06]  All the arrogant and every evil doer will be stubble.
[3968.18 --> 3971.54]  That's the useless kind of stuff that comes from the grain.
[3972.72 --> 3973.80]  That day is coming.
[3974.64 --> 3978.24]  And the day that is coming will set them on fire,
[3978.34 --> 3979.16]  Says the Lord Almighty.
[3979.30 --> 3980.70]  Not a root or a branch,
[3981.38 --> 3982.88]  Not under the ground, not above it,
[3983.38 --> 3985.18]  Will be left to them.
[3985.18 --> 3991.64]  Now notice he talks here about the arrogant and every evil doer.
[3992.16 --> 3994.60]  So a question I had as I read this is,
[3994.86 --> 3997.50]  Why single out arrogant?
[3997.70 --> 3999.02]  I mean, doesn't every evil doer,
[3999.06 --> 3999.96]  Doesn't that kind of cover everything?
[4000.26 --> 4002.14]  Why arrogant and every evil doer?
[4002.64 --> 4003.78]  Well, I think it's this.
[4004.30 --> 4005.30]  According to the Bible,
[4005.30 --> 4010.62]  Arrogance or pride is an inflated view of the self.
[4011.02 --> 4011.54]  Right?
[4011.62 --> 4012.04]  It says,
[4013.10 --> 4015.44]  Kind of put yourself over God.
[4016.12 --> 4019.08]  It says that you know better than God.
[4020.28 --> 4021.04]  And specifically,
[4021.26 --> 4028.32]  This danger of arrogance or pride is that it is a sin that prevents you from actually dealing with all of the other sins.
[4028.32 --> 4029.92]  So think about it this way.
[4030.32 --> 4032.78]  Imagine you have an evil doer who is repentant.
[4033.82 --> 4035.62]  Even if they are very evil,
[4036.28 --> 4037.86]  If they are repentant,
[4037.90 --> 4038.74]  They have great hope.
[4039.26 --> 4041.02]  Because they've recognized their sin,
[4041.08 --> 4041.98]  They know it's wrong,
[4042.12 --> 4043.26]  And they want to change.
[4044.86 --> 4048.00]  But now you might have a relatively minor sinner,
[4048.16 --> 4048.82]  A small sinner.
[4048.82 --> 4051.74]  But if they refuse to recognize it,
[4052.32 --> 4052.46]  Right?
[4052.50 --> 4054.24]  If they refuse to humble themselves,
[4054.42 --> 4058.92]  They have little chance of turning to God for forgiveness.
[4059.78 --> 4061.98]  And that's why the arrogant are singled out.
[4062.20 --> 4065.22]  Because it is a sin that prevents people from coming to God.
[4067.18 --> 4071.20]  So what is in store on this day for the arrogant and evil doers?
[4071.32 --> 4075.52]  Well, Malachi gives us an image that is centered on this picture of an oven's heat.
[4076.02 --> 4078.16]  And the word translated there is furnace,
[4078.82 --> 4080.24]  Actually refers to an oven.
[4080.58 --> 4082.28]  An oven for cooking bread.
[4083.26 --> 4084.44]  In the ancient Near East,
[4084.52 --> 4087.60]  An oven was not something that you kept in your house.
[4088.44 --> 4092.08]  So on those very hot days when you don't want to bake anything because it will make your house too hot,
[4092.40 --> 4093.22]  They have the same idea.
[4093.70 --> 4095.44]  So you put your oven outside the house.
[4095.58 --> 4100.38]  It would be this large earthen structure that would usually build outside in a courtyard.
[4100.92 --> 4101.74]  It was round.
[4101.88 --> 4103.34]  It had really thick walls.
[4104.42 --> 4106.44]  You know, if you've ever been to one of those pizza restaurants, right?
[4106.44 --> 4109.80]  Where they have those big kind of wood burning pizza ovens in the back.
[4109.86 --> 4112.50]  And you can look at it and you see the fire in the back.
[4112.66 --> 4113.36]  And it's burning.
[4113.46 --> 4114.34]  That's the general idea.
[4115.20 --> 4116.50]  So this oven would be lit.
[4116.60 --> 4117.66]  There would be a fire inside.
[4118.04 --> 4120.80]  And after a time of heating, this oven would get extremely hot.
[4121.40 --> 4124.02]  The bricks would retain the heat and kind of amplify it.
[4124.02 --> 4127.02]  And God says for those who persist in evil,
[4127.44 --> 4129.74]  For those who don't return to the Lord,
[4130.44 --> 4132.74]  This is what the day of the Lord holds.
[4133.44 --> 4134.96]  Not a pleasant cooking day.
[4135.90 --> 4141.66]  He says the heat of the fire will be applied to the arrogant and to evildoers.
[4141.66 --> 4147.42]  Now we, today, live on this side of Easter.
[4148.22 --> 4151.54]  And one thing we understand is that when Jesus came as God's king,
[4151.88 --> 4154.88]  He ushered in this very day that Malachi was talking about.
[4155.74 --> 4161.70]  So Mark, in the Gospel of Mark, right in the beginning, chapter 1, verses 14 and 15, it says this.
[4162.08 --> 4167.72]  After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God.
[4167.94 --> 4169.04]  The time has come.
[4169.04 --> 4173.32]  He said, the kingdom of God has come near.
[4174.22 --> 4177.02]  Repent and believe the good news.
[4177.70 --> 4178.12]  Right?
[4178.22 --> 4180.74]  Jesus is saying the day you've been anticipating,
[4181.16 --> 4183.08]  The day you have been longing for,
[4183.50 --> 4186.92]  Has come because I am here.
[4188.22 --> 4190.08]  And when Christ rose from the dead,
[4190.50 --> 4193.40]  He sealed and He promised something for us.
[4193.96 --> 4196.24]  The promise is that this new dawn,
[4196.42 --> 4198.64]  This day that has risen,
[4199.04 --> 4202.28]  It will continue to rise until He returns
[4202.28 --> 4207.02]  And fully establishes the day that He inaugurated in His first coming.
[4207.96 --> 4210.28]  And so on that future day, when He comes again,
[4210.38 --> 4211.68]  This day that is still to come,
[4211.98 --> 4213.92]  It will be a day of judgment.
[4215.50 --> 4217.16]  Now lots of us want to protest.
[4217.16 --> 4222.40]  That doesn't seem like something Jesus would do.
[4222.40 --> 4222.84]  Right?
[4223.80 --> 4226.42]  That doesn't feel like what I know about Jesus from the Gospels,
[4226.52 --> 4228.86]  Who healed people,
[4229.02 --> 4229.84]  And loved them,
[4229.90 --> 4231.12]  And taught them God's word.
[4231.12 --> 4234.90]  But in Matthew chapter 3, verse 12,
[4235.24 --> 4238.04]  John the Baptist is talking about Jesus,
[4238.16 --> 4239.52]  Who He is, what He came to do.
[4239.56 --> 4240.46]  And this is what he says,
[4240.46 --> 4243.02]  His winnowing fork is in His hand,
[4243.02 --> 4245.38]  And He will clear His threshing floor,
[4245.80 --> 4247.56]  Gathering His wheat into the barn,
[4247.86 --> 4250.50]  And burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
[4250.50 --> 4254.90]  See, this prophecy in Malachi about the coming day,
[4254.96 --> 4256.86]  It was already partially fulfilled
[4256.86 --> 4261.22]  When Christ came as a man to dwell among God's people.
[4261.72 --> 4263.32]  And we believe that on the cross,
[4263.86 --> 4266.20]  Jesus died so that the wrath of God,
[4266.56 --> 4268.30]  That was burning like an oven,
[4268.70 --> 4271.90]  Might not fall on people who trust in Him.
[4273.46 --> 4276.48]  Yet what about those who do not trust in Christ,
[4276.60 --> 4278.36]  But who persist in evil doing,
[4278.62 --> 4280.32]  Who decide that they know better,
[4280.32 --> 4281.64]  Who live apart from God?
[4282.52 --> 4285.26]  Well, Malachi says that God will judge evildoers.
[4286.30 --> 4288.34]  One day His wrath will burn.
[4288.76 --> 4291.06]  It will be an awful day of judgment
[4291.06 --> 4293.00]  For those who reject Christ,
[4293.16 --> 4295.58]  Who want nothing to do with God.
[4298.26 --> 4300.50]  Today as we consider the meaning of Easter,
[4301.22 --> 4302.88]  What we must realize,
[4303.62 --> 4305.44]  Is that Easter is a double-edged sword.
[4306.30 --> 4307.46]  And here's what I mean by that.
[4307.46 --> 4310.60]  If today we celebrate a Savior,
[4310.60 --> 4314.54]  Who rose victorious over the grave,
[4314.94 --> 4315.72]  Over sin,
[4315.84 --> 4316.42]  Over death,
[4316.48 --> 4317.38]  Over hell and judgment,
[4317.38 --> 4320.28]  We have to realize that those are real things,
[4320.28 --> 4322.56]  That we need rescuing from.
[4323.56 --> 4324.04]  Right?
[4324.04 --> 4325.74]  So if you go home later today,
[4326.42 --> 4328.24]  And you hear a knock on your door,
[4328.88 --> 4329.94]  And you open the door,
[4330.06 --> 4331.16]  And there's someone who's like,
[4331.36 --> 4332.64]  Just kind of breathless,
[4332.70 --> 4334.68]  From having sprinted over to your house,
[4335.26 --> 4336.78]  And they say,
[4337.18 --> 4338.80]  Good news,
[4339.24 --> 4340.12]  We've won.
[4340.12 --> 4344.40]  It's probably your first question is going to be like,
[4344.82 --> 4345.40]  Won what?
[4345.94 --> 4346.16]  Right?
[4346.46 --> 4347.46]  What have we won?
[4347.84 --> 4349.38]  What enemy has been defeated?
[4349.58 --> 4350.50]  What are we celebrating?
[4352.06 --> 4354.10]  Easter is this double-edged sword,
[4354.38 --> 4356.62]  Or else it has lost its meaning.
[4357.52 --> 4357.74]  Right?
[4357.82 --> 4359.64]  Why was He risen from the dead,
[4359.66 --> 4360.64]  If not for this,
[4360.76 --> 4362.14]  That the day of the Lord is coming,
[4362.14 --> 4365.14]  And is coming with judgment for anyone,
[4365.40 --> 4370.04]  Who has not found a place next to His mighty shining throne.
[4370.92 --> 4374.56]  By humbling themselves before Him as King.
[4375.24 --> 4377.46]  And not in pride making ourselves King,
[4377.64 --> 4379.48]  But to acknowledge that He is King,
[4379.84 --> 4382.26]  And to live under His good and gracious and loving rule.
[4383.54 --> 4385.36]  So friends, please listen to me this morning.
[4385.92 --> 4389.90]  If you realize today that you are numbered among the evildoers,
[4389.90 --> 4390.46]  Right?
[4390.56 --> 4392.80]  If you have not yet trusted in Christ,
[4393.26 --> 4394.84]  Recognized Him as King,
[4395.76 --> 4397.46]  In rising from the dead,
[4397.46 --> 4400.50]  Please don't linger there.
[4401.34 --> 4402.52]  Because the day is coming.
[4403.12 --> 4403.90]  Malachi says,
[4404.58 --> 4405.94]  It's as sure as the rising sun.
[4406.54 --> 4408.26]  It's as sure as the tide that comes in.
[4408.94 --> 4409.94]  And it may soon arrive.
[4410.66 --> 4411.32]  Don't stay there.
[4411.32 --> 4414.90]  But here's the second thing that we see in this passage.
[4415.02 --> 4416.98]  The second characteristic of that coming day.
[4417.70 --> 4418.42]  Malachi says,
[4418.50 --> 4419.80]  Not only will it be a day of judgment,
[4420.48 --> 4424.48]  But it will also be a day of hope.
[4424.58 --> 4425.02]  I put hope.
[4425.06 --> 4425.78]  I meant to write joy.
[4425.92 --> 4426.68]  I don't know why I wrote hope.
[4426.92 --> 4427.90]  So a day of joy.
[4428.48 --> 4428.72]  Right?
[4428.72 --> 4433.42]  It will be even more profoundly a day of joy.
[4433.42 --> 4439.46]  Each and every one of us deserves judgment.
[4441.06 --> 4441.48]  Right?
[4441.54 --> 4443.04]  Because we are all evildoers.
[4444.14 --> 4448.14]  But God in His love and in His grace made a way for joy.
[4449.14 --> 4450.32]  So look with me at verse 2.
[4451.82 --> 4452.52]  It says,
[4452.66 --> 4453.32]  But for you,
[4453.44 --> 4453.76]  But,
[4453.90 --> 4454.94]  It's always that when you see that word,
[4455.06 --> 4455.26]  But,
[4455.34 --> 4457.42]  That means there's the gospel there.
[4457.90 --> 4458.06]  Okay?
[4458.12 --> 4459.84]  There's a new hope.
[4459.84 --> 4460.16]  So,
[4460.28 --> 4460.54]  But,
[4461.18 --> 4461.82]  For you,
[4462.18 --> 4464.18]  Who revere my name.
[4467.18 --> 4467.54]  First,
[4467.64 --> 4470.98]  He says that this day will be different for those who revere God's name.
[4471.12 --> 4471.30]  Now,
[4471.34 --> 4471.88]  what does that mean?
[4472.80 --> 4474.94]  What does it mean to revere God's name?
[4475.76 --> 4476.14]  Well,
[4476.20 --> 4476.84]  in the scriptures,
[4477.24 --> 4479.28]  the name of someone represents who they are.
[4480.24 --> 4480.46]  So,
[4480.54 --> 4480.68]  you know,
[4480.74 --> 4481.64]  names aren't just a title.
[4481.80 --> 4481.84]  Like,
[4481.92 --> 4482.18]  you know,
[4482.54 --> 4482.88]  Bev.
[4483.10 --> 4483.32]  Hey,
[4483.36 --> 4483.64]  Bev.
[4483.90 --> 4484.12]  Right?
[4484.58 --> 4484.80]  That,
[4484.90 --> 4485.08]  you know,
[4485.92 --> 4487.56]  that's not just a name like that.
[4487.56 --> 4488.08]  But actually,
[4488.22 --> 4488.80]  it's a name
[4488.80 --> 4491.34]  that tells you something about their character.
[4492.52 --> 4493.00]  So,
[4493.08 --> 4494.50]  to revere God's name,
[4494.92 --> 4495.34]  then,
[4495.42 --> 4498.28]  is to revere God as He truly is.
[4498.84 --> 4502.30]  Not to revere an image of God that you've made up in your head,
[4502.96 --> 4505.32]  or some half-baked ideas about God.
[4505.76 --> 4510.32]  You're revering the true God as He has revealed Himself in the scriptures.
[4511.52 --> 4511.74]  And so,
[4511.78 --> 4513.82]  to revere God means to take Him seriously,
[4514.32 --> 4515.60]  to treat Him as God,
[4515.60 --> 4517.36]  to believe that He is the Lord,
[4517.36 --> 4521.84]  and that He can dispense justice and mercy as He chooses.
[4523.32 --> 4523.52]  So,
[4523.60 --> 4526.12]  in contrast to the arrogant and the evildoers,
[4526.54 --> 4529.76]  revering God means a kind of humility.
[4531.10 --> 4534.68]  It's an acceptance of who God is and who we are.
[4535.76 --> 4540.96]  That I am a sinner in need of a loving and kind and merciful Savior.
[4540.96 --> 4542.68]  So,
[4542.74 --> 4544.60]  to those who revere God's name,
[4545.10 --> 4546.82]  Malachi says something kind of mysterious.
[4548.10 --> 4549.50]  Verse 2 continues,
[4550.02 --> 4550.66]  and he says,
[4551.08 --> 4552.70]  But for you who revere my name,
[4552.98 --> 4555.62]  the Son of righteousness will rise
[4555.62 --> 4558.22]  with healing in its rays.
[4558.44 --> 4558.80]  If you know,
[4558.84 --> 4558.94]  like,
[4559.00 --> 4559.72]  the King James Version,
[4559.80 --> 4560.64]  other versions,
[4560.72 --> 4561.18]  it says what?
[4561.46 --> 4563.46]  Rise with healing in its wings.
[4563.76 --> 4563.92]  Right?
[4563.96 --> 4564.86]  It's this poetic image.
[4565.10 --> 4566.06]  The rays of the sun.
[4566.06 --> 4569.04]  That sounds lovely, right?
[4569.68 --> 4570.84]  That's a lovely turn of phrase.
[4570.94 --> 4571.80]  It's a beautiful image.
[4572.32 --> 4573.86]  But what in the world is he talking about?
[4574.24 --> 4574.34]  Right?
[4574.36 --> 4575.12]  What does that mean?
[4576.14 --> 4576.34]  Well,
[4576.38 --> 4577.92]  for the Israelites of Malachi's day,
[4578.04 --> 4579.24]  the Son of righteousness
[4579.24 --> 4581.80]  was a clear reference
[4581.80 --> 4583.18]  to the Messiah.
[4583.68 --> 4585.18]  To God's King
[4585.18 --> 4586.44]  who was to come.
[4586.44 --> 4587.76]  So,
[4587.84 --> 4589.24]  listen to what Isaiah says
[4589.24 --> 4591.74]  in Isaiah chapter 60,
[4591.84 --> 4592.68]  verses 1 and 2.
[4594.20 --> 4594.68]  Arise,
[4594.84 --> 4595.22]  shine,
[4595.36 --> 4598.22]  for your light has come,
[4598.42 --> 4599.66]  and the glory of the Lord
[4599.66 --> 4600.90]  has risen upon you.
[4601.14 --> 4601.70]  For behold,
[4601.82 --> 4603.24]  darkness shall cover the earth,
[4603.64 --> 4604.78]  thick darkness the peoples,
[4604.88 --> 4606.68]  but the Lord will rise upon you.
[4607.06 --> 4610.10]  His glory will be seen upon you.
[4610.90 --> 4611.10]  Right?
[4611.16 --> 4612.92]  On the dawning of the day of the Lord,
[4612.92 --> 4615.06]  when that day comes
[4615.06 --> 4615.98]  that they've been hoping
[4615.98 --> 4616.96]  and longing for,
[4617.08 --> 4618.24]  anticipating the dawning
[4618.24 --> 4618.90]  of the day of the Lord,
[4618.94 --> 4619.48]  when it comes,
[4620.50 --> 4621.44]  it will be a sun
[4621.44 --> 4623.08]  that rises characterized
[4623.08 --> 4625.54]  by righteousness and healing.
[4627.12 --> 4628.08]  That is the sun
[4628.08 --> 4629.40]  that will rise and shine on them.
[4630.52 --> 4631.28]  Jesus came.
[4632.50 --> 4633.88]  And what did Jesus claim?
[4634.88 --> 4637.32]  In John chapter 8, verse 12,
[4637.40 --> 4638.20]  Jesus says this.
[4638.88 --> 4640.28]  When Jesus spoke again
[4640.28 --> 4640.98]  to the people,
[4640.98 --> 4641.92]  he said,
[4642.82 --> 4644.06]  I am the light of the world.
[4645.06 --> 4646.20]  Whoever follows me
[4646.20 --> 4647.58]  will never walk in darkness,
[4648.26 --> 4650.44]  but will have the light of life.
[4651.24 --> 4651.46]  Right?
[4651.54 --> 4652.04]  Jesus says,
[4652.32 --> 4654.24]  I am the sun of righteousness
[4654.24 --> 4655.48]  that has risen upon you.
[4656.58 --> 4657.08]  Right?
[4657.14 --> 4658.98]  And if you think about our own sun,
[4659.80 --> 4660.08]  how,
[4660.48 --> 4661.20]  what does our sun do?
[4661.46 --> 4662.50]  It warms the planet.
[4663.08 --> 4665.08]  It allows for photosynthesis,
[4665.44 --> 4666.36]  which kicks off
[4666.36 --> 4668.00]  all kinds of organic processes.
[4668.94 --> 4670.16]  And in a similar way,
[4670.16 --> 4671.20]  Malachi says,
[4671.20 --> 4673.58]  when the sun of righteousness rises,
[4674.24 --> 4677.42]  a million processes kick off
[4677.42 --> 4679.68]  that reverse and undo everything
[4679.68 --> 4680.38]  that's been broken
[4680.38 --> 4681.32]  in God's good creation.
[4682.32 --> 4684.00]  So when the sun of righteousness comes,
[4685.34 --> 4686.52]  all wrongs will be righted.
[4687.02 --> 4688.90]  All wounds will then be healed.
[4689.30 --> 4691.14]  All sicknesses will be done away with.
[4691.30 --> 4692.50]  All tears dried.
[4693.06 --> 4694.10]  Death will be reversed.
[4694.60 --> 4696.32]  And the curse will give way to blessing.
[4697.60 --> 4697.88]  Friends,
[4697.88 --> 4699.34]  that's what Jesus accomplished
[4699.34 --> 4700.22]  in his resurrection.
[4701.08 --> 4702.08]  And the resurrection means
[4702.08 --> 4703.68]  that everything eventually gets healed.
[4704.22 --> 4705.78]  And the world is made right again.
[4706.62 --> 4706.88]  Now,
[4706.94 --> 4708.22]  how are we going to feel on that day?
[4708.50 --> 4710.56]  That day when the sun of righteousness comes
[4710.56 --> 4713.06]  and these warm healing rays
[4713.06 --> 4714.20]  shine upon us,
[4714.34 --> 4716.58]  kicking off healing and blessing.
[4718.08 --> 4719.20]  What will it feel like?
[4719.24 --> 4719.78]  In verse 2,
[4719.84 --> 4720.74]  Malachi says this,
[4721.16 --> 4722.72]  you will go out and frolic
[4722.72 --> 4723.88]  like well-fed calves.
[4725.56 --> 4727.50]  Anybody like that image of yourself?
[4728.70 --> 4728.88]  Right?
[4728.92 --> 4730.48]  The Bible says you're like a cow
[4730.48 --> 4732.78]  that's jumping around.
[4732.90 --> 4734.40]  So I reached out to Lorna
[4734.40 --> 4736.12]  for help in illustrating this.
[4736.50 --> 4738.38]  She sent me this little video clip.
[4745.04 --> 4745.72]  Very cute.
[4745.76 --> 4746.22]  One more time.
[4746.56 --> 4746.88]  It's short.
[4746.88 --> 4747.88]  Can you go back?
[4747.88 --> 4756.90]  It's like those cat videos,
[4757.00 --> 4757.12]  you know,
[4757.16 --> 4757.40]  you see,
[4757.50 --> 4758.60]  but it's like cow videos.
[4759.26 --> 4759.28]  So,
[4759.54 --> 4760.84]  you know,
[4760.92 --> 4762.14]  a key component
[4762.14 --> 4763.58]  to the work of Jesus
[4763.58 --> 4766.00]  is that he releases us
[4766.00 --> 4767.54]  from slavery,
[4768.12 --> 4768.66]  repent up,
[4769.22 --> 4770.58]  he releases us into joy.
[4770.58 --> 4773.12]  So now the very righteousness
[4773.12 --> 4776.00]  that burns up the evildoers
[4776.00 --> 4777.46]  that we should have consumed by
[4777.46 --> 4778.58]  because it is so hot.
[4779.26 --> 4780.46]  Now that same righteousness
[4780.46 --> 4782.76]  brings healing and peace
[4782.76 --> 4783.72]  and joy in life.
[4784.80 --> 4786.06]  It's like where these calves
[4786.06 --> 4787.84]  that have been pent up for so long
[4787.84 --> 4789.72]  and now the first time in months
[4789.72 --> 4792.10]  have seen grass
[4792.10 --> 4794.32]  and we go out leaping
[4794.32 --> 4796.06]  and we find joy
[4796.06 --> 4796.90]  in his righteousness
[4796.90 --> 4798.24]  rather than a threat.
[4799.64 --> 4800.40]  Malachi says,
[4800.84 --> 4801.44]  on that day
[4801.44 --> 4802.44]  when Jesus comes,
[4802.90 --> 4803.86]  you will be released
[4803.86 --> 4804.74]  into real joy.
[4805.64 --> 4806.68]  And if you have come
[4806.68 --> 4807.56]  to Christ today,
[4807.66 --> 4807.84]  friends,
[4807.90 --> 4808.46]  if you have come
[4808.46 --> 4809.12]  to Christ today,
[4809.44 --> 4810.60]  that joy and that hope
[4810.60 --> 4811.86]  is available to you
[4811.86 --> 4812.32]  right now.
[4813.32 --> 4814.82]  But there's also a future day
[4814.82 --> 4815.86]  that this is pointing to.
[4816.50 --> 4817.68]  A day when that joy
[4817.68 --> 4819.08]  will be fully realized.
[4819.32 --> 4820.66]  When everything that plagues
[4820.66 --> 4821.44]  and hurts us
[4821.44 --> 4823.08]  will be tread underfoot.
[4823.62 --> 4824.80]  When Satan himself,
[4824.92 --> 4825.78]  his head will be crushed.
[4826.56 --> 4827.56]  And we will go running
[4827.56 --> 4828.54]  and bounding
[4828.54 --> 4830.04]  into that bright future,
[4831.00 --> 4832.20]  free and happy at last.
[4833.06 --> 4834.54]  The resurrection of Jesus
[4834.54 --> 4836.00]  at Easter guaranteed
[4836.00 --> 4837.80]  a world that will end
[4837.80 --> 4838.70]  in that bright,
[4839.32 --> 4840.12]  happy, warm day.
[4841.24 --> 4842.02]  And so when the light
[4842.02 --> 4842.84]  of the sun dawned
[4842.84 --> 4843.70]  on Easter morning,
[4843.88 --> 4845.44]  that S-O-N,
[4845.78 --> 4847.00]  sun of righteousness,
[4847.30 --> 4848.02]  rose from the dead.
[4848.72 --> 4849.56]  And having faced
[4849.56 --> 4850.90]  the judgment of God
[4850.90 --> 4851.92]  for our sin,
[4852.48 --> 4854.32]  he did so
[4854.32 --> 4855.50]  that his light
[4855.50 --> 4856.64]  might shine upon us,
[4856.64 --> 4857.96]  not to consume us,
[4858.44 --> 4859.28]  but to give us life.
[4860.38 --> 4861.48]  No, no one is born
[4861.48 --> 4862.28]  revering God.
[4863.46 --> 4864.68]  None of our hearts
[4864.68 --> 4865.50]  work right.
[4865.58 --> 4866.56]  Our hearts are one
[4866.56 --> 4867.26]  of these things
[4867.26 --> 4868.24]  that need to be healed.
[4869.24 --> 4870.40]  For all of us,
[4870.42 --> 4872.06]  we are predisposed
[4872.06 --> 4872.74]  to end up
[4872.74 --> 4873.24]  with the arrogant
[4873.24 --> 4874.20]  and the evildoers.
[4874.68 --> 4875.96]  And yet the son of God,
[4876.04 --> 4876.98]  the son of righteousness,
[4877.28 --> 4878.14]  rose from the grave
[4878.14 --> 4880.10]  so that when we come
[4880.10 --> 4880.58]  to Christ
[4880.58 --> 4881.16]  and when we put
[4881.16 --> 4882.20]  our trust in him,
[4883.18 --> 4884.36]  when we are united
[4884.36 --> 4885.08]  to him by faith,
[4885.14 --> 4886.30]  we too will rise
[4886.30 --> 4887.56]  from the dead
[4887.56 --> 4888.86]  and we will have life.
[4889.80 --> 4890.74]  Now, an appropriate
[4890.74 --> 4892.42]  ending to this whole
[4892.42 --> 4894.00]  book of Malachi
[4894.00 --> 4894.64]  that we have been
[4894.64 --> 4895.30]  studying together,
[4895.68 --> 4896.84]  as an ending to that,
[4896.92 --> 4897.58]  we are going to sing
[4897.58 --> 4898.10]  an old hymn.
[4899.48 --> 4900.88]  This hymn celebrates
[4900.88 --> 4902.00]  the coming of that day,
[4902.66 --> 4904.06]  that day when the son
[4904.06 --> 4904.68]  of righteousness
[4904.68 --> 4905.78]  began to rise.
[4905.78 --> 4906.98]  And this hymn
[4906.98 --> 4908.22]  has been hijacked
[4908.22 --> 4908.78]  by Christmas.
[4910.34 --> 4911.16]  So it might feel
[4911.16 --> 4911.76]  a little bit strange
[4911.76 --> 4913.32]  to us to sing it right now,
[4913.44 --> 4914.98]  but it is totally appropriate.
[4915.80 --> 4917.20]  It's Hark the Herald Angels Sing.
[4918.06 --> 4919.00]  So I want to read
[4919.00 --> 4919.78]  the first verse
[4919.78 --> 4920.90]  of the song
[4920.90 --> 4921.88]  and then I will pray
[4921.88 --> 4923.64]  and then we will stand
[4923.64 --> 4924.58]  and we will sing it together.
[4925.24 --> 4925.82]  In celebration
[4925.82 --> 4926.58]  that Christ,
[4927.08 --> 4927.82]  the son of righteousness,
[4928.10 --> 4928.92]  has indeed risen.
[4929.64 --> 4930.70]  Here's the words,
[4930.78 --> 4931.24]  verse 3.
[4931.72 --> 4932.84]  Hail the heaven-born
[4932.84 --> 4933.84]  prince of peace.
[4933.84 --> 4935.14]  Right?
[4935.18 --> 4935.82]  It's God's king.
[4936.86 --> 4938.70]  Hail the son of righteousness,
[4939.42 --> 4940.26]  light and life
[4940.26 --> 4941.34]  to all he brings,
[4941.50 --> 4942.36]  risen with healing
[4942.36 --> 4943.82]  in his wings.
[4943.96 --> 4944.52]  Malachi 4.
[4945.54 --> 4947.26]  Mild he lays his glory by,
[4947.42 --> 4949.14]  born that we no more
[4949.14 --> 4949.94]  may die.
[4950.62 --> 4951.66]  Why did Christ rise?
[4952.56 --> 4953.76]  Born to raise us
[4953.76 --> 4954.38]  from the earth,
[4955.12 --> 4955.82]  born to give us
[4955.82 --> 4956.34]  second birth.
[4957.20 --> 4958.54]  Hark the Herald Angels Sing,
[4959.44 --> 4961.28]  glory to the newborn king.
[4961.44 --> 4961.94]  Let's pray.
[4961.94 --> 4964.60]  Father in heaven,
[4964.74 --> 4965.92]  thank you that you have come.
[4966.92 --> 4968.32]  We thank you that you are
[4968.32 --> 4970.28]  the son of righteousness
[4970.28 --> 4972.36]  and that you have risen
[4972.36 --> 4973.24]  upon us.
[4974.14 --> 4975.60]  And so I pray for all of us here
[4975.60 --> 4977.26]  that we would be like
[4977.26 --> 4977.98]  these calves
[4977.98 --> 4979.40]  leaping from the stall,
[4979.50 --> 4980.68]  that we would find our joy
[4980.68 --> 4981.82]  and our hope in you alone.
[4982.64 --> 4983.76]  And we pray, oh God,
[4983.80 --> 4984.78]  that the son of righteousness
[4984.78 --> 4986.78]  would fully rise
[4986.78 --> 4989.28]  and it would order our world
[4989.28 --> 4990.58]  in peace
[4990.58 --> 4991.86]  and in beauty.
[4992.68 --> 4994.58]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4995.08 --> 4995.34]  Amen.
[4995.82 --> 4996.48]  So let's stand.
[4996.94 --> 4998.12]  Let's sing Hark the Herald Angels Sing,
[4998.20 --> 4998.78]  just verse 3,
[4999.04 --> 5000.18]  and then we'll sing another song.
[5000.18 --> 5014.24]  Hark the Herald Angels Sing,
[5014.24 --> 5015.88]  Blood girl sticks with them
[5015.88 --> 5016.56]  hear their words
[5016.56 --> 5025.56]  and
[5025.56 --> 5031.78]  Christ of Christ, still the Son of righteousness,
[5032.86 --> 5037.46]  Light and life to how He leads,
[5037.80 --> 5042.14]  risen and healed in His grace.
[5042.14 --> 5047.30]  God, He leads His glory by,
[5047.64 --> 5052.26]  for loving the morning time,
[5052.26 --> 5057.12]  Lord, to raise us from the earth,
[5057.50 --> 5061.82]  Lord, to give us a sacrifice,
[5062.48 --> 5066.98]  Lord, the Lamb of angels sing,
[5066.98 --> 5073.32]  Lord, we turn on the new Lord King.
[5082.26 --> 5092.02]  O heaven, be the one who die
[5092.02 --> 5094.06]  is worn out sinners,
[5094.14 --> 5100.28]  set with us and rolled ao an every sin of death,
[5100.54 --> 5104.60]  sing, sing, Alleluia.
[5104.60 --> 5111.20]  It makes us want to be better
[5111.20 --> 5115.22]  Christ, disciples, in their eyes
[5115.22 --> 5119.40]  Life is sound and end of day
[5119.40 --> 5123.48]  And His blessing is risen
[5123.48 --> 5128.66]  Let's just listen to peace, listen to me
[5128.66 --> 5132.08]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5132.08 --> 5136.72]  Join the course in the glory deep
[5136.72 --> 5141.04]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5141.04 --> 5147.58]  Redoubred in dark, His cross will be
[5147.58 --> 5151.36]  His love and him, He's lost him
[5151.36 --> 5156.04]  And Christ are those who have not seen
[5156.04 --> 5159.84]  Let's sing Alleluia
[5159.84 --> 5167.36]  Don't I fear, I'm home in faith
[5167.36 --> 5171.36]  With angels, the tune, and the love of peace
[5171.36 --> 5175.84]  And glory of their lives, it is
[5175.84 --> 5179.70]  Life, life, ever-lasting
[5179.70 --> 5184.80]  Voices, bells, and bells are indeed
[5184.80 --> 5189.12]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5189.12 --> 5193.20]  Join the course in the glory deep
[5193.20 --> 5197.76]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5197.76 --> 5199.76]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5199.76 --> 5202.40]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5202.40 --> 5204.40]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5204.40 --> 5207.92]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5207.92 --> 5209.92]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5209.92 --> 5211.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5211.92 --> 5213.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5213.92 --> 5215.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5215.92 --> 5219.92]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5219.92 --> 5221.92]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5221.92 --> 5223.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5223.92 --> 5224.60]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5224.60 --> 5229.84]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5229.84 --> 5233.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5233.92 --> 5235.20]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5235.20 --> 5235.92]  road the course in the glory deep
[5235.92 --> 5236.24]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5236.24 --> 5239.92]  Christ is risen, He's risen indeed
[5239.92 --> 5243.92]  Oh, sing Alleluia
[5243.92 --> 5248.58]  God, the Lord, sing the glory deep.
[5249.02 --> 5252.10]  Christ is risen, is risen indeed.
[5265.90 --> 5271.20]  So we continue to worship the Lord this morning with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[5271.20 --> 5280.32]  Our designated offering is to the Omram family who serve with Resonate Global Mission in Egypt.
[5281.08 --> 5288.52]  So as the deacons come forward to collect the morning offering, please join me in a quick word of prayer.
[5290.40 --> 5295.44]  Living God, you have given us so much in Jesus Christ.
[5296.20 --> 5298.52]  You have given us hope and joy and peace.
[5298.72 --> 5300.88]  And above all, Lord, you have given us life.
[5301.96 --> 5304.50]  What can we give in return?
[5305.04 --> 5307.70]  If the whole world was ours, it would not be enough.
[5308.58 --> 5313.44]  But what we have, we humbly offer to you with hearts full of thanksgiving and praise.
[5313.58 --> 5315.14]  Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[5315.14 --> 5315.50]  Amen.

[5485.60 --> 5515.58]  I love you.

[5523.98 --> 5530.70]  And so we pray today especially for Najee and Ann and their family serving you in the Middle East.
