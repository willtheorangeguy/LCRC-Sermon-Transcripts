[418.02 → 420.92] It won't start the 12th, but we'll start on the 19th.

[439.50 → 442.14] and there's a sign-up sheet on the back table in the back here.
[442.14 → 456.52] A book, and there's a book written and there's a book
[456.52 → 459.78] that, and the book, and it's a book, and there's a book, and there's a book, and there's a book day of the book, and there's a book, and there's a book that you can see your book.
[459.78 → 465.78] using that during the next months. Those are all the announcements that I had.
[465.78 → 473.46] Our call to worship today is a responsive reading based on Psalm 24
[473.46 → 483.96] verses 7 to 10. So join up with me, I'll take my glasses off, and I will read the
[483.96 → 488.84] first portions as usual. Lift your heads you gate, be lifted you ancient
[488.84 → 496.52] doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord
[496.52 → 504.38] strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift your heads you gate, lift
[504.38 → 512.46] them up you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is he this King
[512.46 → 524.14] of glory? The Lord Almighty, he is the King of glory. The Lord's greeting comes from
[524.14 → 529.64] Isaiah 43, the first several verses where God is speaking through the prophet Isaiah.
[529.64 → 536.14] He says, do not fear for I have redeemed you. I have summoned you by name, you are
[536.14 → 541.82] mine. And then he says in a metaphorical manner, when you pass through the waters, I
[541.82 → 545.82] will be with you. And when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[545.82 → 551.02] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you
[551.02 → 562.14] ablaze. For I am the Lord your God. Thanks be to God. If you're able to stand, please, please do so and welcome one another in the name of the Lord this morning.
[562.14 → 564.14] Thank you.
[592.14 → 594.14] Thank you.

[608.68 → 614.50] What a wonderful New Year's buzz in the room greeting each other. Welcome in the name of the Lord.
[614.56 → 621.92] Let's join the words of this song. All creatures of our God and King goes through the elements of the earth,

[882.30 → 885.00] I rest on His

[893.10 → 895.54] My anchor holds

[1027.22 → 1029.22] You may be seated.
[1036.22 → 1044.22] In our time of confession and assurance, I've selected some portions of Psalm 51 and Psalm 103.
[1044.22 → 1063.22] Now Psalm 51 was written shortly after Nathan pointed out David's sin involving Bathsheba, and we heard about that in great detail during the sermon series that we experienced earlier about the mothers of Jesus in Bathsheba.
[1064.22 → 1073.22] Psalm 103 on the other hand was written also by David and the commentator Charles Spurgeon makes the case that it was written late in David's life, perhaps reflecting on the Bible.
[1073.22 → 1075.22] Perhaps reflecting on his life.
[1075.22 → 1087.22] So as you can imagine, Psalm 51 is very confessionally oriented and Psalm 103 when David looks back on his life, he sees a lot of God's assuring grace towards him.
[1087.22 → 1094.22] I'll be reading the portions of Psalm 51, and you can respond in each case with Psalm 103.
[1094.22 → 1095.22] Psalm 53
[1095.22 → 1096.22] Beginning
[1096.22 → 1098.22] Psalm 53
[1098.22 → 1107.22] Have mercy up on me, O God, because of your unfailing love, because of your great compassion blot out the stain of my sins.
[1107.22 → 1114.22] Our God is merciful and gracious, slow to get angry and full of unfailing love.
[1114.22 → 1126.22] Wash me, clean me from my guilt, purify me from my sin, for I recognize my shameful deeds, they haunt me day and night.
[1126.22 → 1133.22] God will not constantly accuse us nor remain angry forever.
[1133.22 → 1137.22] Against you and you alone have I sinned.
[1137.22 → 1140.22] I have done what is evil in your sight.
[1140.22 → 1148.22] You will be proved right in what you say and your judgment against me is just.
[1148.22 → 1150.22] We're still in Psalm 51.
[1150.22 → 1159.22] God has not promised us for our sins, nor does he deal with us as we deserve.
[1159.22 → 1168.22] For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1168.22 → 1178.22] As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1178.22 → 1183.22] I was born a sinner from the moment my mother conceived me.
[1183.22 → 1191.22] God is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.
[1191.22 → 1194.22] For he understands how weak we are.
[1194.22 → 1199.22] He remembers that we are only dust.
[1199.22 → 1201.22] You desire honesty from the heart.
[1201.22 → 1205.22] Teach me to be wise in my inmost being.
[1205.22 → 1212.22] Restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you.
[1212.22 → 1219.22] For the love of the Lord remains forever with those who fear him.
[1219.22 → 1226.22] His salvation extends to the children's children of those who are faithful to his covenant,
[1226.22 → 1229.22] those who obey his commandments.
[1229.22 → 1231.22] This is the word of the Lord.
[1231.22 → 1234.22] Our song of assurance is, I surrender all.
[1234.22 → 1247.22] All to Jesus I surrender.
[1247.22 → 1263.22] All to him, I freely give.
[1263.22 → 1270.22] I will ever love and trust him.
[1270.22 → 1276.22] In his presence daily live.
[1276.22 → 1282.22] I surrender all.
[1282.22 → 1296.22] All to thee my blessed Saviour.
[1296.22 → 1302.22] I surrender all.
[1302.22 → 1316.64] All to Jesus I surrender, make me Saviour, holy Thine.
[1316.64 → 1329.96] Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit, truly know that Thou art mine.
[1329.96 → 1342.18] I surrender all, I surrender all.
[1342.18 → 1355.14] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.
[1355.14 → 1369.14] All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee.
[1369.14 → 1376.14] Fill me with Thy love and power.
[1377.32 → 1383.14] Let Thy blessing fall on me.
[1383.14 → 1395.14] I surrender all, I surrender all.
[1395.14 → 1409.14] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.
[1409.14 → 1414.14] All to Thee.
[1414.14 → 1440.46] What a great hymn to prepare our hearts to come to the Lord's table together.
[1440.46 → 1450.70] Before we do so, let us confess what we believe as believers in our Lord Jesus, together using the words of the Apostles' Creed.
[1453.02 → 1454.08] There it is.
[1454.24 → 1455.92] So we'll say the Apostles' Creed together.
[1456.08 → 1456.72] Please join me.
[1456.72 → 1463.04] I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1463.04 → 1473.72] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1473.72 → 1480.32] He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1480.86 → 1482.46] He descended to hell.
[1483.08 → 1486.12] The third day he rose again from the dead.
[1486.52 → 1492.50] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[1493.34 → 1497.14] From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1497.14 → 1511.40] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1512.08 → 1512.46] Amen.
[1513.12 → 1517.10] Please join me in prayer as we come before the Lord.
[1518.44 → 1525.24] Gracious God, we remember in this time the death of your Son, Jesus Christ.
[1525.24 → 1529.82] We proclaim his resurrection and ascension.
[1530.46 → 1536.06] And we look with expectation for his coming as Lord of all the nations.
[1538.42 → 1548.86] Send your Holy Spirit upon us and upon this bread and wine that we who eat and drink at this table may share the life of Christ our Lord.
[1549.70 → 1554.96] Pour out your Spirit upon the whole earth and bring in your new creation.
[1556.02 → 1562.32] Gather your church together from the ends of the earth into your kingdom where peace and justice are revealed.
[1563.10 → 1569.36] That we with all your people of every language, race, and nation may share the banquet you have promised.
[1569.90 → 1576.54] It is through Christ and with Christ and in Christ all honour and glory are yours, our Heavenly Father forever.
[1577.08 → 1577.48] Amen.
[1577.48 → 1577.56] Amen.
[1579.26 → 1593.86] So, beloved, I pray that now, this morning, in this time, that as you take this cup, as you take this bread, that you would experience God's great love for you.
[1594.42 → 1602.14] That you would experience his joy over you, his pleasure in you, even such as we are.
[1602.14 → 1609.86] So, as you take these elements, feast upon Christ, crucified and risen for you.
[1611.12 → 1620.74] And friends, this table is for those who do know our Lord Jesus by faith and for those who have already been baptized as a sign of the covenant.
[1620.74 → 1628.08] If that is you, may he meet you with his boundless mercy and grace this morning.
[1628.58 → 1631.78] And would he fill you to overflowing with his grace.
[1631.78 → 1638.98] Now, we set aside these elements with words from the Bible.
[1639.64 → 1644.84] Words from the Apostle Paul that he heard from our Lord Jesus himself.
[1645.24 → 1649.66] And these are recorded in 1 Corinthians chapter 11, where he said this.
[1649.66 → 1657.04] For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1657.98 → 1662.28] And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said, this is my body which is for you.
[1663.20 → 1665.10] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1666.48 → 1671.88] In the same way also, he took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1672.72 → 1678.12] For as often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1678.12 → 1687.12] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1692.30 → 1701.66] So, brothers and sisters, I now invite you, as the elements will be passed to you, to feed on this bread, the body of Christ.
[1701.76 → 1706.60] To drink of this cup, the blood of Christ, which is for you, his people.
[1706.60 → 1717.82] Do so in your hearts, by faith, with great Thanksgiving and joy, knowing that Christ, our Saviour, has died for each of us.
[1718.52 → 1723.38] May I invite the elders and the deacons who are serving to come forward now and help me serve the elements.
[1723.38 → 1732.60] May I?
[1741.46 → 1744.24] To hear?
[1744.24 → 1745.24] Amen.
[1774.24 → 1776.24] Amen.
[1804.24 → 1806.24] Amen.
[1834.24 → 1836.24] Amen.
[1864.24 → 1866.24] Amen.

[1926.24 → 1928.24] Amen.
[1928.24 → 1930.24] Amen.
[1930.24 → 1932.24] Amen.
[1932.24 → 1934.24] Amen.
[1934.24 → 1939.24] Brothers and sisters, this is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ broken for you.
[1939.24 → 1941.24] Let us eat together.
[1954.24 → 1956.24] Amen.
[1984.24 → 1986.60] Amen.
[1986.60 → 1993.34] Alan, the Paul of the Lord, insideanga above your blood.
[1993.36 → 1994.36] Amen.
[1994.36 → 1997.46] Amen.
[1997.46 → 2001.90] Amen.
[2003.34 → 2007.92] Amen.
[2008.60 → 2013.54] Amen.
[2014.24 → 2015.24] Amen.
[2044.24 → 2045.24] Amen.
[2074.24 → 2076.24] Amen.
[2104.24 → 2106.24] Amen.
[2134.24 → 2164.22] Amen.
[2164.22 → 2170.70] Take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for
[2170.70 → 2172.08] the remission of your sins.
[2172.08 → 2178.86] Let's drink together.
[2178.86 → 2181.50] Please join me in prayer.
[2181.50 → 2187.74] Gracious God, you have given yourself to us, and you have made us yours.
[2187.74 → 2193.20] You prepared a table before us, you have led us to it, and you have fed us abundantly.
[2193.20 → 2196.20] Thank you, our great God, for your life-giving gifts.
[2196.20 → 2203.00] Thank you for uniting us with you and with each other, for giving us new life and new hope,
[2203.00 → 2207.38] and for preparing us to live as your people by your grace.
[2207.38 → 2214.48] May our lives now joyfully display our hope in you in the world, in the power of your Holy
[2214.48 → 2219.04] Spirit that is with us and in us, we pray in Jesus' name.
[2219.04 → 2219.90] Amen.
[2219.90 → 2219.98] Amen.
[2219.98 → 2220.90] Amen.

[2223.90 → 2224.44] Amen.
[2224.44 → 2224.90] Amen.
[2224.90 → 2225.90] Amen.
[2225.90 → 2226.90] Amen.
[2226.90 → 2227.90] Amen.
[2227.90 → 2230.58] So may I invite all the children to come up and join me at the stairs?
[2230.58 → 2237.58] So may I invite all the children to come up and join me at the stairs.
[2237.58 → 2244.58] Yeah, right up here, right up here, come back.
[2244.58 → 2249.58] I was going to say, you were the first one.
[2249.58 → 2251.58] You were fast.
[2260.58 → 2275.58] Oh no, uh oh.
[2275.58 → 2280.58] Where's your mommy?
[2280.58 → 2284.58] Mommy's coming.
[2284.58 → 2285.58] All right, come up.
[2285.58 → 2289.58] You can sit down, have a seat, have a seat.
[2289.58 → 2290.58] You can sit here.
[2290.58 → 2292.58] Would you like to sit here?
[2292.58 → 2295.58] Oh, well just, just here.
[2295.58 → 2297.58] You can sit down.
[2297.58 → 2306.58] Okay, so who, okay, shh, who knows what this is?
[2306.58 → 2310.58] What is this?
[2310.58 → 2313.58] It's a salt shaker, yeah.
[2313.58 → 2314.58] Salt shaker.
[2314.58 → 2317.58] Do any of you have this on your dining room table?
[2317.58 → 2319.58] Maybe where you eat, do you have a salt shaker?
[2319.58 → 2321.58] And what do you do with this?
[2321.58 → 2323.58] Maybe, do you guys want to sit?
[2323.58 → 2325.58] Here, you come sit over here.
[2325.58 → 2326.58] Okay.
[2326.58 → 2327.58] Yeah?
[2327.58 → 2328.58] Okay.
[2328.58 → 2329.58] So, this is a salt shaker.
[2329.58 → 2335.58] Who here likes things that taste really sweet?
[2335.58 → 2336.58] Me.
[2336.58 → 2339.58] Do you like sweet things, like candy?
[2339.58 → 2340.58] Yeah?
[2340.58 → 2341.58] Okay.
[2341.58 → 2343.58] Who likes, it's okay.
[2343.58 → 2346.58] Who likes things that taste bitter?
[2346.58 → 2349.58] Like dark chocolate without much sugar.
[2349.58 → 2350.58] Or like coffee.
[2350.58 → 2351.58] Who drinks coffee?
[2351.58 → 2352.58] Come on.
[2352.58 → 2353.58] Okay, so.
[2353.58 → 2354.58] It's a small holiday.
[2354.58 → 2355.58] It's chocolate.
[2355.58 → 2356.58] So, bitter.
[2356.58 → 2357.58] There's bitter.
[2357.58 → 2358.58] There's sweet.
[2358.58 → 2359.58] There's bitter.
[2359.58 → 2360.58] And then what's another flavour?
[2360.58 → 2361.58] Sour.
[2361.58 → 2362.58] Does anybody like sour things?
[2362.58 → 2363.58] Yeah, sour.
[2363.58 → 2364.58] Chocolate.
[2364.58 → 2365.58] Yeah.
[2365.58 → 2368.58] And then, there's also things that taste salty.
[2368.58 → 2370.58] Who likes potato chips?
[2370.58 → 2371.58] Potato what?
[2371.58 → 2372.58] Yeah, salty potato chips.
[2372.58 → 2373.58] Me.
[2373.58 → 2374.58] You do?
[2374.58 → 2375.58] Yeah, they're salty.
[2375.58 → 2377.58] Do you like popcorn that has salt on it?
[2377.58 → 2378.58] Oh, yeah.
[2378.58 → 2379.58] Yeah?
[2379.58 → 2381.58] Or salty crackers, things like that?
[2381.58 → 2382.58] Well.
[2382.58 → 2384.58] You want to eat potato chips, don't you?
[2384.58 → 2387.58] I want to read you something that Jesus said.
[2387.58 → 2390.58] Jesus said something fascinating about salt.
[2390.58 → 2392.58] This is what Jesus said.
[2392.58 → 2401.58] He said, he was talking to his followers, and he said, you are the salt of the earth.
[2401.58 → 2402.58] The salt?
[2402.58 → 2403.58] The salt of the earth.
[2403.58 → 2408.58] But, if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
[2408.58 → 2409.58] It can't.
[2409.58 → 2410.58] Right?
[2410.58 → 2412.58] If it loses its saltiness, it can't be salty again.
[2412.58 → 2417.58] And then he says, it is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown and trampled by men.
[2417.58 → 2419.58] So, he says, you are the salt of the earth.
[2419.58 → 2420.58] What does that mean?
[2420.58 → 2422.58] How are people like salt?
[2422.58 → 2424.58] People who follow Jesus like salt.
[2424.58 → 2426.58] What does salt do?
[2426.58 → 2430.58] You just put salt on the food and make it sour?
[2430.58 → 2431.58] You put it on the food, yeah.
[2431.58 → 2434.58] You put the salt on the food, and it makes it salty.
[2434.58 → 2435.58] But, you know what?
[2435.58 → 2436.58] It's not only salty.
[2436.58 → 2440.58] Salt takes all the flavours of food, and it makes them better.
[2440.58 → 2441.58] Better.
[2441.58 → 2444.58] So, even if you have something like broccoli, yeah.
[2444.58 → 2449.58] If you put some salt on it, it tastes better.
[2449.58 → 2452.58] It makes it even more broccoli tasting.
[2452.58 → 2454.58] In a good way.
[2454.58 → 2455.58] Yeah.
[2455.58 → 2461.58] Or, you know, sometimes when I cook, and I make soup and I taste it, and it's like, eh, it's a little bland.
[2461.58 → 2467.58] You just add some salt and all the flavours of the soup come out.
[2467.58 → 2473.58] So, Jesus says, we are like salt, we are like salt in the world.
[2473.58 → 2482.58] So, that means as salt we go out into the world as Jesus' followers, and we add flavour into the world.
[2482.58 → 2483.58] How do we do that?
[2483.58 → 2484.58] We live with salt.
[2484.58 → 2486.58] Well, no, but how do we do that as people?
[2486.58 → 2487.58] It's a metaphor.
[2487.58 → 2488.58] Yeah.
[2488.58 → 2498.58] As we go out, and we follow Jesus, we obey his word, we live for him, and we live like him.
[2498.58 → 2504.58] And Jesus says when we follow him and obey his commands, we will be like salt in the world.
[2504.58 → 2505.58] We will add flavour.
[2505.58 → 2506.58] Okay?
[2506.58 → 2507.58] Can you all remember that?
[2507.58 → 2508.58] Okay?
[2508.58 → 2514.58] You got to be salty, flavourful, delicious people in the world, giving the world lots of flavour.
[2514.58 → 2515.58] Okay?
[2515.58 → 2516.58] And we do that by following Jesus.
[2516.58 → 2517.58] Let's pray.
[2517.58 → 2518.58] You want to pray?
[2518.58 → 2519.58] Do this.
[2519.58 → 2520.58] Ready?
[2520.58 → 2521.58] Let's pray.
[2521.58 → 2529.58] Heavenly Father, we pray that you would help us to follow Jesus and that we would be salty believers,
[2529.58 → 2534.58] like you call us to be with your help, so that we might live for you and glorify your name in the world.
[2534.58 → 2536.58] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2536.58 → 2537.58] Amen.
[2537.58 → 2538.58] All right.
[2538.58 → 2539.58] Thank you for joining me.
[2539.58 → 2540.58] Go on.
[2540.58 → 2541.58] You can go back now.
[2541.58 → 2542.58] Come on, baby.
[2542.58 → 2543.58] You got to sit down.
[2543.58 → 2544.58] Okay.
[2544.58 → 2545.58] Okay.
[2545.58 → 2546.58] Okay.
[2546.58 → 2547.58] Okay.
[2547.58 → 2548.58] Okay.
[2548.58 → 2562.58] So, our Chinese brothers, you may go to have your sermon, as well, right now.
[2562.58 → 2565.40] And the children are dismissed for Sunday school.
[2577.30 → 2583.50] And so today we only have one Sunday school class for age three to kindergarten.
[2584.40 → 2585.18] So, okay.
[2592.58 → 2601.38] Our scripture reading today is from Matthew 5, verses 1 through 10.
[2602.34 → 2606.46] In your pew Bible, you can find this on page 719.
[2608.70 → 2609.22] 719.
[2609.72 → 2612.08] Matthew 5, verses 1 through 10.
[2613.46 → 2619.48] Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[2619.48 → 2624.68] His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.
[2625.64 → 2626.42] He said,
[2627.30 → 2632.26] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2633.92 → 2638.02] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[2639.88 → 2644.54] Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[2644.54 → 2650.92] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[2652.80 → 2657.04] Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
[2658.76 → 2662.12] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
[2663.82 → 2669.44] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
[2669.44 → 2677.16] Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2679.80 → 2681.40] This is the word of the Lord.
[2682.20 → 2683.42] Thanks be to God.
[2696.16 → 2697.34] Please join me in prayer.
[2699.44 → 2710.72] Heavenly Father, we are so grateful that you have enabled Matthew the tax collector to remember, then to write down all that Jesus said.
[2710.72 → 2721.92] And so now we ask that in your mercy and by your grace, that you would help us to understand what you are saying to us today.
[2722.40 → 2724.42] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2726.10 → 2730.72] So today is the first Sunday in the church season of Epiphany.
[2730.72 → 2731.44] Epiphany.
[2731.44 → 2731.48] Epiphany.
[2731.48 → 2731.52] Epiphany.
[2731.52 → 2731.56] Epiphany.
[2731.56 → 2731.64] Epiphany.
[2731.64 → 2732.04] Epiphany.
[2732.04 → 2732.24] Epiphany.
[2732.24 → 2736.10] And the season of Epiphany follows Advent and Christmas.
[2736.82 → 2744.12] And it is the season when the church around the world considers the earthly ministry and mission of Jesus Christ.
[2744.84 → 2752.50] And the way that we are doing that is through a sermon series on what has traditionally been called the Beatitudes.
[2753.56 → 2756.82] And the word Beatitude is a beautiful word.
[2757.50 → 2760.28] It's a word that means blessing.
[2761.00 → 2762.10] It's a word that means blessing.
[2762.68 → 2771.66] And so Jesus is telling us in this passage where he says, blessed, blessed, blessed, the Beatitudes, he's telling us what it means to have a blessed life.
[2772.66 → 2776.70] Now, blessed isn't really a word that we use too often today.
[2777.36 → 2788.50] But actually, over the last five to ten years with, you know, social media, it actually has become a little bit more common.
[2788.50 → 2793.66] So, for instance, someone takes a photo at the beach.
[2794.46 → 2795.24] They tag it.
[2796.50 → 2796.90] What?
[2797.78 → 2798.26] Blessed.
[2798.88 → 2799.20] Blessed.
[2799.20 → 2802.70] Have any of you ever tagged a photo?
[2802.94 → 2803.30] Blessed.
[2804.58 → 2805.10] Admit it.
[2805.26 → 2805.62] Admit it.
[2806.56 → 2806.90] No?
[2807.06 → 2807.24] Okay.
[2807.30 → 2811.88] Maybe not many of you use social media, which is maybe a good thing.
[2813.30 → 2817.04] You know, but you'll, on social media, you'll see, at Facebook or Instagram, you'll see stuff tagged all the time.
[2817.10 → 2817.50] Blessed.
[2817.86 → 2819.64] You know, or someone's eating a salad.
[2819.94 → 2820.26] Blessed.
[2820.86 → 2821.84] All kinds of things.
[2821.92 → 2822.22] Blessed.
[2822.22 → 2822.30] Blessed.
[2822.94 → 2829.42] And now, it is, it's good to be thankful for all of God's blessings in life, of course.
[2830.96 → 2836.74] And we acknowledge that all things come from the good hands of God.
[2837.54 → 2840.18] But this is not what Jesus means in the Beatitudes.
[2840.18 → 2854.74] When Jesus says, blessed are you, he's not talking about temporary or circumstantial feelings of happiness, you know, that we might have when we're on vacation on the beach.
[2855.58 → 2861.02] Rather, he's talking about a state of well-being in relationship with God.
[2861.72 → 2865.70] A state of well-being in relationship with God.
[2865.82 → 2868.22] That is what it means to be blessed.
[2868.22 → 2872.16] And so, what does this blessed life look like?
[2872.28 → 2877.80] What does it look like when we are in relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ?
[2880.50 → 2885.96] What does it look like when we have been grabbed by the gospel?
[2886.92 → 2887.82] That's our question.
[2888.36 → 2894.18] And last week, we began with the first Beatitude in verse 3, which we'll put here on the screen.
[2894.18 → 2899.06] It says, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[2899.86 → 2908.80] So here, Jesus congratulates those who are not rich in themselves, who are kind of full of pride and self-sufficiency.
[2908.80 → 2915.44] But those who are poor in themselves, and who then bring their poverty to God.
[2915.90 → 2924.74] They come to God as spiritual beggars, with empty hands, with empty pockets, and say, Lord, have mercy on me.
[2925.22 → 2926.86] That's what it means to be blessed poor.
[2926.86 → 2933.34] And today, we're looking at the second Beatitude, which we find in verse 4.
[2933.80 → 2939.26] It says, blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[2940.36 → 2943.48] Now, the second Beatitude builds on the first one.
[2944.48 → 2951.38] So Jesus says, in effect, not only are you poor, but you're also sad.
[2952.20 → 2952.32] Right?
[2952.64 → 2953.96] Blessed are those who mourn.
[2953.96 → 2956.78] And that seems an odd thing to say, doesn't it?
[2958.12 → 2960.76] Blessed are those who mourn.
[2960.88 → 2966.22] Or you could say, happy are those who are sad.
[2967.78 → 2968.04] Right?
[2968.46 → 2973.78] The heartbroken people are the happy people.
[2974.54 → 2975.90] How does that make sense?
[2976.92 → 2978.92] Well, it makes sense like this.
[2978.92 → 2986.32] When the real Jesus gets through to our hearts, he stretches us emotionally.
[2987.00 → 2990.94] And he stretches us emotionally in two directions at the same time.
[2991.62 → 2995.96] Simultaneously, when we meet the real Jesus, we become happier.
[2996.42 → 2997.24] We rejoice.
[2998.32 → 2999.92] There's the joy of our salvation.
[2999.92 → 3002.82] And we become sadder.
[3003.66 → 3004.86] Both together.
[3005.66 → 3008.38] This is what happens when we are grasped by the gospel.
[3009.06 → 3015.08] Because remember that the qualities that Jesus blesses here are not natural qualities.
[3015.72 → 3018.92] This isn't just like everybody has these qualities.
[3018.92 → 3025.22] So the picture that this second beatitude suggests is not of Jesus coming into the world,
[3026.30 → 3031.26] encountering people who are just mourning because of the trials of everyday life,
[3031.52 → 3033.24] and then bringing comfort to them.
[3033.82 → 3034.80] That's not what's happening.
[3035.20 → 3037.26] I mean, Jesus does that.
[3037.84 → 3038.80] Praise be to God.
[3038.80 → 3043.26] For example, he spotted the widow in the town of Main.
[3043.88 → 3049.82] And he finds this widow following a funeral procession of her son who is dead.
[3051.50 → 3055.48] Jesus spots her, and he reaches out to her.
[3055.98 → 3057.74] So this is what Luke 7 says.
[3058.76 → 3062.60] When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her, and he said,
[3063.40 → 3064.82] Don't cry.
[3064.82 → 3067.14] Then he went up.
[3067.24 → 3071.34] He touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still.
[3071.78 → 3075.32] He said, Young man, I say to you, get up.
[3076.00 → 3081.62] The dead man sat up, and he began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
[3082.78 → 3083.72] That's so amazing.
[3084.96 → 3087.90] And we love this about Jesus.
[3088.52 → 3091.14] We love his compassionate heart.
[3091.14 → 3099.48] But events like this, of Jesus comforting those who are mourning in the world because of loss or death or just hardship,
[3100.06 → 3103.14] that's not what is pictured here in the second beatitude.
[3103.86 → 3112.38] Rather, the picture is that of Jesus coming into the world, calling people to himself, calling people to follow him,
[3112.88 → 3117.42] who then begin to mourn.
[3117.42 → 3127.14] Yes, they and we begin to rejoice, but also they and we begin to mourn.
[3127.70 → 3128.30] Why?
[3128.96 → 3136.54] Why, when you encounter Jesus, when you get to know the real Jesus, does it make you mourn?
[3137.32 → 3139.94] Why do the disciples of Jesus begin to mourn?
[3140.62 → 3141.36] Here's why.
[3141.36 → 3150.98] It's because when we get close to the heart of Jesus, what breaks the heart of God begins to break our hearts as well.
[3152.42 → 3157.64] And when what breaks the heart of God begins to break our hearts, Jesus says to us,
[3158.20 → 3160.18] Blessed are you.
[3160.18 → 3163.72] Or he says this word blessed.
[3163.94 → 3166.64] It's like, that's what I'm talking about.
[3167.34 → 3169.58] It's like, yes, right on.
[3170.00 → 3177.18] Or I'm reading a book by the preacher, Pastor Daryl Johnson on the Beatitudes, and this is how he says it.
[3177.96 → 3178.92] In sync.
[3180.32 → 3181.44] That's what blessed means.
[3181.84 → 3182.26] In sync.
[3182.26 → 3188.26] When you mourn the things that God mourns, you are in sync with the kingdom.
[3188.78 → 3191.08] You are in sync with Jesus.
[3191.98 → 3192.54] Blessed.
[3194.50 → 3199.18] And it's kind of like this, that the bigger our grasp is of the gospel,
[3200.22 → 3203.26] the bigger our grasp of the gospel becomes,
[3203.60 → 3205.60] the happier you will be,
[3205.60 → 3208.40] and the sadder you will be.
[3209.38 → 3212.76] And Jesus says it is a sure sign that I am becoming real to you
[3212.76 → 3216.84] when you start mourning in all the best ways.
[3217.92 → 3219.28] So that's the second beatitude.
[3220.02 → 3222.38] Now let's break it down a little bit more.
[3222.46 → 3223.64] Let's dig into it a bit more.
[3223.92 → 3225.86] In two simple steps this morning.
[3226.28 → 3228.16] First, blessed are those who mourn.
[3228.82 → 3231.20] Then, for they will be comforted.
[3231.54 → 3234.58] And so in other words, first, what are the causes of mourning?
[3235.60 → 3238.64] And then secondly, what is the comfort for blessed mourners?
[3239.16 → 3240.12] So let's look at this.
[3240.18 → 3242.38] First, the causes of mourning.
[3242.84 → 3244.14] Blessed are those who mourn.
[3244.52 → 3250.94] And Jesus calls us blessed when he sees us mourning at two different levels.
[3251.76 → 3259.20] The first level is Jesus calls us blessed when we mourn over our own sin.
[3259.20 → 3265.60] When we meet Jesus in all of his fullness,
[3265.72 → 3268.02] in all of who he is, the Holy One,
[3268.56 → 3272.72] we are forced to face the reality of our sin,
[3273.18 → 3277.32] and especially the reality of sin in our own lives.
[3278.48 → 3280.64] And, I mean, how could it be otherwise?
[3281.82 → 3281.98] Right?
[3282.08 → 3286.56] So mourning is simply the emotional impact of being poor in spirit.
[3286.56 → 3289.26] It follows from the first beatitude.
[3290.28 → 3293.18] And so this second evidence that you are a disciple of Jesus
[3293.18 → 3296.48] is that you grieve, you mourn over your sin.
[3297.16 → 3297.52] Right?
[3297.60 → 3303.20] Not denying it, not trivializing it, not being flippant about it,
[3303.82 → 3305.44] but feeling it.
[3306.72 → 3308.16] So here's an example.
[3308.94 → 3312.04] David Brainerd was a friend of Jonathan Edwards.
[3312.04 → 3316.62] He was a missionary to the Native Americans in the 1740s.
[3317.52 → 3319.24] He wrote this in his journal.
[3320.50 → 3321.32] I'll have it here.
[3322.68 → 3324.42] In my mourning devotions,
[3325.14 → 3327.98] my soul was exceedingly melted,
[3328.54 → 3333.36] and I bitterly mourned over my exceeding sinfulness.
[3333.88 → 3340.10] I never before felt so deep a sense of the odious nature of my sin.
[3340.10 → 3341.60] Now listen.
[3342.72 → 3347.86] My soul was then unusually carried forth in love to God,
[3348.44 → 3353.34] and had a lively sense of God's love to me.
[3354.58 → 3355.62] Now isn't that interesting?
[3356.58 → 3360.24] Brainerd says this deep sense of mourning over his sin
[3360.24 → 3363.78] led to a deeper sense of God's love for him.
[3364.74 → 3365.22] Right?
[3365.28 → 3367.12] Brainerd understood the gospel.
[3367.26 → 3368.32] That is the gospel, friends.
[3368.32 → 3371.26] That mourning is a part of the Christian life.
[3372.06 → 3377.46] And in fact, Brainerd, he found that mourning was like the wardrobe
[3377.46 → 3381.56] through which he stepped into the Narnia of God's love.
[3384.38 → 3385.80] Here's another example.
[3386.64 → 3388.90] The Book of Common Prayer, 1662.
[3389.46 → 3392.78] It takes us to this deep place in the heart of God
[3392.78 → 3394.64] that teaches us to pray like this,
[3394.66 → 3395.96] and this is a prayer of confession.
[3395.96 → 3400.32] It says, Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3400.50 → 3402.74] Maker of all things, Judge of all men,
[3403.36 → 3410.34] we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness.
[3410.40 → 3411.54] I mean, acknowledge our sins.
[3411.64 → 3412.32] I mean, sure, right?
[3412.50 → 3413.62] That's just good theology.
[3413.76 → 3414.60] We acknowledge our sins.
[3415.02 → 3421.70] But bewail our manifold sins and our wickedness.
[3422.64 → 3422.86] Right?
[3422.86 → 3424.44] Does that seem extreme to you?
[3425.64 → 3427.40] It didn't seem extreme to Jesus.
[3429.14 → 3432.54] As he becomes more real to us,
[3433.34 → 3435.02] our emotions deepen.
[3436.02 → 3441.48] We just can't be indifferent or blasé about our sinfulness.
[3441.48 → 3447.08] And we see this in the New Testament letters as well.
[3448.04 → 3449.54] I'll share a few verses with you.
[3449.70 → 3451.96] Romans 7, verse 24.
[3452.34 → 3456.40] Paul is talking about his own struggle with sin in his life,
[3456.52 → 3457.22] and he says,
[3457.38 → 3458.86] What a wretched man I am.
[3458.86 → 3463.96] 1 Corinthians, chapter 5, verse 2.
[3465.24 → 3468.98] Paul wrote to some Christians who are trivializing sin in their church,
[3469.14 → 3469.74] and he said,
[3470.00 → 3471.92] Shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning?
[3473.94 → 3476.74] And then in James 4, 7, James says,
[3477.16 → 3478.88] Grieve, mourn, and wail.
[3479.24 → 3482.64] Change your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
[3482.64 → 3482.68] Hmm.
[3483.68 → 3484.50] It's quite the verse, huh?
[3485.06 → 3486.36] Does anybody have that on their fridge?
[3487.00 → 3487.24] No.
[3488.78 → 3494.12] You know, I know we've got to look at these verses in the larger context of the cheerful,
[3494.62 → 3496.74] the joyful news of the gospel.
[3497.86 → 3498.28] Yes.
[3498.28 → 3500.38] But the question is,
[3500.46 → 3504.82] do these verses have any place in our Christianity?
[3504.82 → 3509.46] Because it does have a place in the Beatitudes.
[3511.04 → 3512.34] In the Lord of the Rings,
[3512.58 → 3513.40] it's been a long time,
[3513.52 → 3515.32] so we've got to find a way.
[3515.92 → 3516.94] In the Lord of the Rings,
[3517.86 → 3520.46] when Frodo the Hobbit is on Weather top,
[3521.18 → 3522.16] remember what happens.
[3522.80 → 3525.04] He receives a deep wound.
[3526.08 → 3526.20] Right?
[3526.32 → 3528.66] The moral blade pierces him deeply,
[3528.94 → 3532.30] and he never fully recovers from that wound.
[3532.30 → 3537.42] But it made Frodo a profound hobbit.
[3537.84 → 3541.14] It made him a wholehearted hobbit,
[3541.22 → 3543.58] because deep wounds deepen us.
[3544.48 → 3547.98] And each of us has been pierced by sin.
[3548.84 → 3550.40] And if we follow Christ,
[3551.08 → 3557.40] we will hurt more painfully through our growing self-awareness of that wound.
[3558.18 → 3560.34] But it will also stretch us emotionally,
[3560.34 → 3564.68] making us both sadder because of our sin
[3564.68 → 3568.76] and happier because of our salvation.
[3570.76 → 3573.20] In the presence of Jesus, the Holy One,
[3573.28 → 3576.62] we can't but grieve over our unholy condition.
[3577.16 → 3578.66] And if that is our response,
[3578.74 → 3580.04] if in the face of Jesus,
[3580.68 → 3583.74] when we are grasped and held by the Holy One,
[3583.74 → 3586.10] if we mourn our sin,
[3586.44 → 3587.48] Jesus says to us,
[3587.98 → 3588.24] blessed,
[3589.60 → 3591.34] in sync,
[3591.88 → 3592.48] with me,
[3593.12 → 3593.72] and the kingdom.
[3595.76 → 3598.58] Now, blessed mourners mourn over their own sin,
[3598.68 → 3600.42] but secondly, like Jesus himself,
[3600.56 → 3603.56] they also mourn over the sin and brokenness of our world.
[3604.58 → 3604.80] Right?
[3604.80 → 3608.16] Now, again, Jesus is the joyful creator.
[3608.50 → 3608.62] Right?
[3608.82 → 3612.52] Jesus is joy itself,
[3612.86 → 3616.22] who out of his own joy created us to enjoy him.
[3616.74 → 3617.92] We are created for joy.
[3618.96 → 3619.94] The psalmist says,
[3620.34 → 3622.70] in your presence there is fullness of joy,
[3622.96 → 3626.06] at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[3626.06 → 3630.26] But there is also in his heart,
[3630.38 → 3631.18] in the heart of Jesus,
[3631.64 → 3634.00] a brokenness because of what sin has done,
[3634.72 → 3637.48] and this great sorrow over the world.
[3638.62 → 3640.86] Luke tells us that Jesus came into Jerusalem
[3640.86 → 3642.60] on Palm Sunday,
[3643.82 → 3645.80] and he wept over the city.
[3646.22 → 3647.14] And this word wept,
[3647.28 → 3650.86] it refers to this spontaneous outpouring
[3650.86 → 3652.54] of weeping and grief.
[3653.74 → 3655.52] Now, why would Jesus grieve?
[3655.52 → 3656.92] Why he grieved over the city?
[3658.48 → 3661.16] After gaining his composure, he says,
[3662.10 → 3665.08] because you do not know the things that make for peace.
[3666.32 → 3669.44] He weeps over their unrepentant hearts,
[3669.60 → 3671.12] their hearts that would not accept him,
[3671.34 → 3672.34] that would not be healed.
[3675.12 → 3677.88] And Christians, likewise, who know the real Jesus,
[3678.00 → 3681.08] we don't just merely condemn the evil of our society,
[3681.32 → 3682.88] we weep over it.
[3683.18 → 3684.90] We weep at unrepentant hearts
[3684.90 → 3687.26] that because of sin has caused brokenness.
[3687.68 → 3688.62] We have compassion,
[3688.92 → 3690.54] not judgment, but compassion.
[3692.06 → 3693.52] And you know, the apostle Paul,
[3693.62 → 3694.86] he grieved similarly.
[3695.86 → 3697.62] He writes in Philippians 3,
[3697.62 → 3701.24] for as I have often told you before,
[3701.24 → 3702.28] and I'll tell you again,
[3702.28 → 3704.20] even with tears,
[3704.52 → 3707.18] many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
[3708.36 → 3708.46] Right?
[3708.52 → 3712.52] This was that people are living as enemies of the cross
[3712.52 → 3715.58] was a source of mourning for Paul.
[3715.58 → 3718.82] So Jesus wept over Jerusalem,
[3718.82 → 3720.88] and there's another time when Jesus wept.
[3722.52 → 3726.28] The apostle John tells us that Jesus wept at the grave
[3726.28 → 3728.04] of his good friend Lazarus.
[3728.78 → 3728.90] Right?
[3728.98 → 3729.52] Jesus comes,
[3729.60 → 3731.62] he stands by the graveside of Lazarus,
[3731.62 → 3734.84] and he is overcome with grief,
[3734.84 → 3740.40] with this heaving, heartfelt grief,
[3740.40 → 3743.54] because death is not natural.
[3744.12 → 3746.92] Because death is not the way God created the world to be.
[3746.98 → 3748.44] It is not supposed to be this way.
[3748.78 → 3749.76] And Jesus grieves.
[3749.76 → 3754.56] The Christian philosopher Nicholas Overstaff,
[3754.96 → 3757.64] he and his wife lost their son, Eric,
[3758.08 → 3759.44] in a mountain climbing accident.
[3760.46 → 3763.14] And in his book called Lament for a Son,
[3764.22 → 3767.36] Overstaff openly shares his grief.
[3768.10 → 3771.40] And he reflects in the book on the way the world is
[3771.40 → 3774.24] in comparison to the way the world is supposed to be.
[3775.24 → 3778.52] And he talks about this passage, this beatitude,
[3778.52 → 3779.78] and he asks,
[3779.94 → 3780.84] who are the mourners?
[3781.40 → 3783.62] Who are the mourners whom Jesus blesses?
[3784.22 → 3785.44] And this is how he answers.
[3786.86 → 3788.12] Who then are the mourners?
[3789.08 → 3792.22] The mourners are those who have caught a glimpse
[3792.22 → 3793.92] of God's new day,
[3794.86 → 3799.20] who ache with all of their being for that day's coming,
[3800.26 → 3801.98] and who break out into tears
[3801.98 → 3805.42] when confronted with its absence.
[3805.42 → 3810.14] Christians grieve over the world.
[3811.24 → 3813.70] We grieve over the brokenness of the fall.
[3814.60 → 3816.78] We grieve over divisions in the church.
[3817.58 → 3821.06] We grieve over structural sin and injustice in society.
[3822.16 → 3825.60] We grieve over people who don't know Jesus.
[3825.60 → 3831.20] Because when we meet the real Jesus,
[3831.34 → 3834.58] we catch a vision of the way the world should be.
[3836.04 → 3836.92] And Jesus says,
[3837.06 → 3838.42] blessed are those who mourn.
[3838.92 → 3842.78] You ache because you are my disciples.
[3844.10 → 3846.06] Because when you get close to Jesus
[3846.06 → 3848.28] and feel what Jesus feels,
[3848.38 → 3850.60] you cannot help but mourn.
[3850.60 → 3855.46] And friends, that brings us to the second part of the beatitude,
[3856.26 → 3858.10] the comfort for blessed mourners.
[3859.52 → 3861.38] Blessed are those who mourn, Jesus says,
[3861.76 → 3865.26] for they will be comforted.
[3865.68 → 3867.66] And the question we want to know is when.
[3868.66 → 3870.14] When will we be comforted?
[3870.82 → 3872.14] Well, clearly in the end.
[3872.14 → 3875.38] When the kingdom comes in all of its fullness,
[3875.78 → 3877.18] then we will be comforted.
[3877.92 → 3879.52] When in Revelation 21,
[3879.76 → 3882.28] as the voice from the throne says,
[3883.40 → 3884.34] we have the verse here,
[3884.46 → 3888.14] he will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[3888.62 → 3890.02] There will be no more death,
[3890.38 → 3892.56] or mourning, or crying, or pain,
[3892.68 → 3895.32] for the old order of things has passed away.
[3895.32 → 3902.82] But, we will also be comforted before the end.
[3903.90 → 3907.08] We will be comforted even now.
[3908.16 → 3908.68] How?
[3909.90 → 3912.32] Well, this verb translated comfort
[3912.32 → 3915.76] is the Greek word parallel.
[3916.22 → 3917.76] It's a fun word, so say it with me.
[3918.06 → 3918.62] Parallel.
[3919.64 → 3920.24] Parallel.
[3920.40 → 3921.08] It's a pretty word.
[3921.08 → 3921.52] Parallel.
[3923.30 → 3925.76] The primary meaning of parallel
[3925.76 → 3927.30] is to encourage,
[3928.16 → 3929.70] to embolden,
[3930.12 → 3931.94] to come alongside and strengthen.
[3933.12 → 3935.80] It's the word that would be used by soldiers
[3935.80 → 3937.54] who are encouraging each other,
[3938.20 → 3939.26] strengthening one another
[3939.26 → 3940.30] as they went off to battle.
[3941.38 → 3943.16] And this is actually the original meaning
[3943.16 → 3944.96] of our English word for comfort.
[3945.94 → 3947.00] The English word comfort
[3947.00 → 3949.00] comes from two Latin words,
[3949.32 → 3950.88] com-fortis.
[3951.84 → 3953.00] Com- means with.
[3953.40 → 3954.88] Fortis-means to strengthen.
[3955.34 → 3957.62] It's related to our word fortify.
[3958.54 → 3960.90] So, comfort means strengthened
[3960.90 → 3962.88] by being with.
[3964.48 → 3966.22] And the gospel comforts us
[3966.22 → 3969.08] not with sentimentality,
[3969.20 → 3970.00] not with just, you know,
[3970.06 → 3971.68] a pat on the back comfort,
[3972.58 → 3973.38] but with power.
[3974.54 → 3975.72] Blessed are those who mourn,
[3975.72 → 3977.78] for they will be comforted.
[3977.84 → 3980.58] They will be mightily comforted.
[3981.08 → 3982.96] They will be comforted with power
[3982.96 → 3984.58] that puts life into them,
[3984.84 → 3986.56] that puts wind in their sails,
[3986.62 → 3987.88] that lifts them up,
[3988.66 → 3989.40] strengthens.
[3990.68 → 3992.58] And God will do it how?
[3993.36 → 3996.22] He will do it by being with us.
[3996.78 → 3997.52] With us.
[3997.52 → 4001.00] You know, the Bible gives this title to God.
[4001.50 → 4002.80] I love this title of God
[4002.80 → 4005.02] in 2 Corinthians chapter 1.
[4005.48 → 4006.66] It's in the opening of the letter.
[4007.30 → 4007.88] Paul writes,
[4008.60 → 4011.22] that God is the father of compassion,
[4012.22 → 4014.26] the God of all comfort,
[4014.82 → 4016.20] who comforts us
[4016.20 → 4018.16] in all our troubles.
[4018.16 → 4021.76] Now, I love that.
[4022.12 → 4022.94] All comfort.
[4024.78 → 4025.96] Who comforts us
[4025.96 → 4027.76] in all our troubles.
[4028.62 → 4030.60] Every flavour in the ice cream store.
[4031.48 → 4031.62] Right?
[4031.78 → 4032.84] What are you suffering?
[4033.70 → 4034.66] Whatever it is,
[4034.80 → 4036.52] God has a comfort for that suffering.
[4037.68 → 4038.56] And then in this verse,
[4038.62 → 4040.52] it tells us how this comfort comes to us.
[4040.56 → 4041.92] It comes down vertically
[4041.92 → 4042.98] from God himself.
[4042.98 → 4045.66] So that's God.
[4046.10 → 4048.78] Now, Jesus says in John 14,
[4049.90 → 4051.88] when he was about to leave this world,
[4052.00 → 4052.30] he said,
[4052.46 → 4054.18] I will send you another comforter,
[4054.60 → 4055.40] the Holy Spirit,
[4056.08 → 4058.32] upon whom and with whom
[4058.32 → 4059.70] he will baptize his disciples.
[4061.02 → 4061.16] All right?
[4061.20 → 4062.80] So God the Father is our comforter.
[4062.98 → 4065.30] The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us.
[4066.00 → 4068.22] We have the comfort of God's presence
[4068.22 → 4069.52] with us all the time.
[4070.66 → 4071.30] And then,
[4071.64 → 4072.66] one more,
[4073.68 → 4075.34] Isaiah 61 says,
[4076.12 → 4077.22] our Messiah Jesus,
[4077.36 → 4078.44] he came into this world
[4078.44 → 4079.86] with the greatest anointing
[4079.86 → 4081.04] of the Holy Spirit upon him.
[4081.90 → 4083.42] And here's why that anointing
[4083.42 → 4084.28] was given to him.
[4085.12 → 4086.72] To bind up the brokenhearted.
[4087.50 → 4089.40] To comfort all who mourn.
[4090.26 → 4092.58] And provide for those who grieve in Zion
[4092.58 → 4093.84] to bestow on them
[4093.84 → 4095.74] a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
[4096.40 → 4097.74] the oil of joy
[4097.74 → 4099.44] instead of mourning.
[4100.78 → 4102.46] The triune God, friends,
[4102.46 → 4103.36] the triune God,
[4103.64 → 4105.24] Father, Son, Holy Spirit,
[4105.64 → 4106.58] is a comforter.
[4107.38 → 4109.24] And he moves towards us with comfort.
[4109.60 → 4111.38] He comes, and he strengthens us
[4111.38 → 4114.94] in every mourning that we have.
[4114.94 → 4118.50] When we become aware of the depth of our sin,
[4118.62 → 4120.58] God speaks the comforting words
[4120.58 → 4120.92] that say,
[4121.02 → 4122.34] Jesus paid it all.
[4124.72 → 4126.26] The blood of Jesus
[4126.26 → 4128.20] covers all of our sins.
[4128.20 → 4131.74] And when we feel just how broken the world is,
[4132.48 → 4133.10] the God
[4133.10 → 4136.24] that we worship comes, and he speaks words of comfort
[4136.24 → 4136.88] and he says,
[4137.20 → 4138.32] the kingdom is here.
[4138.90 → 4140.32] The kingdom has come.
[4140.90 → 4142.20] Nothing will stand its way,
[4142.26 → 4143.54] not even hell itself.
[4143.76 → 4144.32] And he says,
[4144.40 → 4144.90] behold,
[4145.26 → 4147.02] I am making all things new.
[4147.02 → 4151.98] Weeping may last for the night,
[4152.98 → 4154.74] but joy comes in the morning.
[4156.80 → 4158.10] Everlasting joy, friends,
[4158.28 → 4159.14] everlasting joy
[4159.14 → 4161.64] will be the condition of us
[4161.64 → 4162.52] and of the world
[4162.52 → 4165.40] when Jesus returns.
[4166.24 → 4166.86] Let's pray.
[4166.86 → 4175.04] Father, we come before you
[4175.04 → 4177.92] as mourners.
[4179.78 → 4181.40] Lord, our hearts ache
[4181.40 → 4184.00] in so many different ways
[4184.00 → 4187.40] for the brokenness of this world
[4187.40 → 4188.12] and Lord,
[4188.78 → 4190.36] the brokenness of our own hearts
[4190.36 → 4191.40] because of sin.
[4192.28 → 4193.54] Lord, we lament
[4193.54 → 4196.32] and we mourn all that
[4196.32 → 4198.66] is not the way it's supposed to be,
[4199.40 → 4201.40] not the way you intended,
[4203.60 → 4205.96] and in all the ways that Lord resist
[4205.96 → 4208.80] your love and your healing.
[4210.68 → 4211.72] And so Lord,
[4212.30 → 4215.42] we ask that you would help us
[4215.42 → 4216.76] to encounter the real Jesus.
[4217.68 → 4220.20] We ask that you would help us
[4220.20 → 4222.56] to be held by the Holy One,
[4223.34 → 4225.50] to be grasped by the gospel,
[4226.32 → 4229.12] and that we might have hearts
[4229.12 → 4230.92] like yours,
[4230.92 → 4232.36] that we would be in step
[4232.36 → 4233.32] and in sync
[4233.32 → 4234.76] with our Lord Jesus
[4234.76 → 4235.28] and Lord,
[4235.36 → 4235.90] that you would
[4235.90 → 4238.46] make us blessed mourners.
[4239.54 → 4240.40] We pray, Lord,
[4240.60 → 4241.94] for your work among us
[4241.94 → 4242.46] and in us
[4242.46 → 4243.50] and then through us
[4243.50 → 4244.22] to bring healing
[4244.22 → 4245.80] to this world
[4245.80 → 4246.60] that you love
[4246.60 → 4248.78] and that you are redeeming.
[4249.04 → 4250.28] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4250.78 → 4251.04] Amen.
[4252.54 → 4253.38] Friends, let's stand
[4253.38 → 4254.62] and let's sing our song of response
[4254.62 → 4256.14] and the song is
[4256.14 → 4257.68] What a Friend We Have in Jesus.
[4257.98 → 4258.70] Let's sing together.
[4258.70 → 4287.80] chosen
[4288.70 → 4293.70] What a privilege to carry
[4293.70 → 4299.52] Everything to good and well
[4299.52 → 4305.12] Oh, what peace we ought to torment
[4305.12 → 4311.08] Oh, what needless may we bear
[4311.08 → 4317.40] Oh, because we do not carry
[4317.40 → 4323.40] Everything to good and well
[4323.40 → 4327.40] Oh, what do we do?
[4327.40 → 4329.40] Oh, what do we do?
[4329.40 → 4335.40] Is there trouble anywhere?
[4335.40 → 4342.40] We should never be discouraged
[4342.40 → 4348.40] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4348.40 → 4354.40] Can we find a friend so faithful?
[4354.40 → 4360.40] Who will our sorrows share?
[4360.40 → 4366.40] Jesus knows our every weakness
[4366.40 → 4372.40] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4372.40 → 4378.40] Oh, we're weak and heavy laden
[4378.40 → 4384.40] Comfort with a load of care
[4384.40 → 4392.40] Precious angels still a refuge
[4392.40 → 4396.40] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4396.40 → 4404.40] Do your friends dispose forsake you?
[4404.40 → 4410.40] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4410.40 → 4416.40] In His arms He'll take and shield you
[4416.40 → 4422.40] You will find a solace there
[4422.40 → 4432.40] Amen
[4432.40 → 4436.40] So we continue to worship the Lord
[4436.40 → 4438.40] with the giving of our tithes and offerings
[4438.40 → 4443.40] And our, as John mentioned, our designated offering is
[4443.40 → 4445.40] Therefore Go Ministries
[4445.40 → 4447.40] I'm not going to elaborate on that, sorry
[4447.40 → 4451.40] But I will, I do want to elaborate on something else
[4451.40 → 4455.40] In your bulletins you will have seen a monthly report
[4455.40 → 4458.40] prepared by Mel, our treasurer, with the giving
[4458.40 → 4461.40] And, you know, as I look at this
[4461.40 → 4464.40] And I just want to say praise the Lord
[4464.40 → 4467.40] Because I am amazed, continually amazed
[4467.40 → 4470.40] By the generosity of this congregation
[4470.40 → 4474.40] Who care about the work of the Lord
[4474.40 → 4477.40] Here in Ladder, in our own church
[4477.40 → 4481.40] But also all around the lower mainland
[4481.40 → 4482.40] All around the world
[4482.40 → 4484.40] You give to so many causes
[4484.40 → 4489.40] And I do see that not as a natural quality
[4489.40 → 4493.40] But as a virtue of the kingdom
[4493.40 → 4497.40] That the Holy Spirit is at work in your hearts
[4497.40 → 4499.40] And He is changing you
[4499.40 → 4500.40] And He is making you in this way
[4500.40 → 4502.40] And, so I praise God for that
[4502.40 → 4504.40] So thank you for your generosity
[4504.40 → 4507.40] And we give glory to God
[4507.40 → 4509.40] That being said, that's not like
[4509.40 → 4511.40] So now we have another offering, you know
[4511.40 → 4513.40] But just to say, this is so, you know
[4513.40 → 4515.40] Praise God for that and thank you
[4515.40 → 4517.40] But now we will collect our designated offering for today
[4517.40 → 4519.40] Therefore Go Ministries
[4519.40 → 4521.40] And I'll invite the deacons to come forward
[4523.40 → 4524.16] My
[4524.16 → 4531.86] I'll invite you to
[4531.86 → 4561.84] Thank you.
[4561.86 → 4591.84] Thank you.
[4591.86 → 4621.84] Thank you.
[4621.86 → 4651.84] Thank you.
[4651.86 → 4659.84] As we go to the Lord in prayer, go to the Lord Jesus, as we just sang, and we bring our petitions before him.
[4660.08 → 4660.74] Let's pray together.
[4660.74 → 4672.48] Heavenly Father, we come to you once again as your people, your body, the church, to bring our prayers and our petitions to you.
[4672.48 → 4678.48] We thank you that you are God who delights in listening to us.
[4678.48 → 4690.44] And you call us not to be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving to present our request to you.
[4690.44 → 4695.44] Lord, you are God Almighty.
[4695.44 → 4701.22] You are all-knowing and all-powerful.
[4701.32 → 4702.72] Nothing is unknown to you.
[4702.72 → 4708.76] And so we find comfort in that what is unknown to us is known by you.
[4708.76 → 4716.90] We rejoice in the fact that even when we don't know what to pray, your spirit helps us in our weakness.
[4716.90 → 4723.08] And so, Lord, we thank you that your spirit helps us even now as we lift our prayers to you.
[4724.40 → 4726.96] And Lord, first, we want to pray for our city of Delta.
[4726.96 → 4733.76] We pray that your blessing would be poured out over the city and over its people.
[4735.10 → 4741.16] We pray for your kingdom to come in all of its fullness and flourishing upon our neighbours.
[4742.90 → 4752.00] We pray for the poor and the needy, for those trapped in abuse, for those who feel they are in hopeless situations.
[4752.00 → 4758.64] God, you see the brokenness of our city and your heart breaks for those who are hurting.
[4759.86 → 4765.32] Lord, open our hearts and help us to have hearts that break for the things that break yours.
[4766.26 → 4773.62] And then, Lord, would you send us out to be your hands and feet, to be heralds of the gospel.
[4773.62 → 4783.90] For those who don't know you, Lord, would they, through us, through word and deed, Lord, come to see and know our Lord Jesus.
[4785.16 → 4790.64] Lord, we pray for the other churches in our city, and especially, Lord, in Ladder.
[4792.22 → 4799.26] Churches, even all around us, who also this morning, maybe even at this very moment, are worshipping you.
[4799.36 → 4800.80] Lord, we are one body with them.
[4800.80 → 4807.38] Lord, we celebrate the gospel victories that they celebrate.
[4807.56 → 4811.32] We mourn the challenges that they face.
[4814.96 → 4816.94] Lord, we also pray for our church.
[4818.12 → 4819.76] Lord, you have been faithful to us.
[4820.76 → 4824.02] As we look back on this year, we see your goodness.
[4825.12 → 4827.38] We see that you are our good shepherd.
[4827.38 → 4839.64] Lord, and so we have faith, and we have confidence that no matter what comes in the coming year, that you will still be faithful, and you still will shepherd us, come what may, because you are with us and you love us.
[4839.64 → 4847.02] And we thank you for not only leading us, but blessing us with gifted and godly leaders.
[4847.02 → 4852.22] Lord, we thank you for the Lord, and so many who serve in all the ministries of our church.
[4852.38 → 4863.90] Lord, grant each one of them in every capacity in which they serve, even in the service of gathering, of greeting, of singing, of praying.
[4864.72 → 4870.60] Lord, grant us strength and wisdom and energy and faithfulness in your presence in the year ahead.
[4870.60 → 4878.12] Father, we also lift people in our congregation, Lord, who mourn this morning.
[4878.22 → 4883.32] We especially pray for Henry and Janet, who mourn the loss of their brother, Egbert.
[4884.60 → 4888.80] Lord, would you bind up the brokenhearted, be close to those who grieve.
[4890.04 → 4898.08] Lord, we pray that you would be close to Robin, who also still feels the mourning loss of her mom.
[4898.08 → 4904.34] Lord, would you be with Pat as she recovers from her surgery.
[4906.32 → 4916.30] Lord, would you be with Ellie as she is in Elam Village.
[4917.52 → 4923.38] Would you be with Jordan and Vanessa and heal Jordan, Lord, of his cancer.
[4924.62 → 4926.02] Lord, would you be with Grace.
[4926.02 → 4933.74] Would you be with Eileen and heal them, Lord, from their ailments.
[4935.32 → 4940.10] Lord, we think of all of those who are lonely.
[4941.68 → 4943.52] And we think of all those who are lost.
[4944.78 → 4949.32] And Lord, we pray for your compassionate heart, the compassionate heart that we see in your gospel.
[4949.84 → 4951.84] Lord, that would come and touch them.
[4951.84 → 4956.78] Lord, we also lift to you, Nancy, Pastor Nancy.
[4957.72 → 4967.50] We pray, Lord, that you would continue every day to give her the nourishment she needs, to become strengthened, to give her the rest that she needs, not only in body but in spirit.
[4968.38 → 4973.60] Lord, to recover in that she's so anxious to return to her ministry.
[4973.60 → 4985.08] But Lord, give her this time of rest and help her know that even in her weakness that you are strong and that you are the Lord of your church and that you are at work even when we are not.
[4986.60 → 4993.84] Lord, all of these things we lift to you because you are the God who sees, who hears, and who acts.
[4993.84 → 4997.52] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4999.18 → 5000.42] Friends, would you please stand?
[5001.04 → 5003.18] And we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5003.24 → 5008.92] And right after our service today, you are invited to head through the doors into our fellowship hall to grab some coffee.
[5009.20 → 5015.28] I don't know if there's anything else, but certainly we'll have some people to greet as we go out there.
[5015.64 → 5018.50] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5018.50 → 5028.84] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and may the love and the blessing of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be upon you and with you now and always.
[5029.44 → 5029.76] Amen.
[5029.76 → 5029.84] Amen.
[5048.50 → 5058.54] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5058.54 → 5070.66] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5070.66 → 5081.80] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5083.64 → 5093.98] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5093.98 → 5106.64] My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[5107.98 → 5119.80] My friends, may you grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5119.80 → 5130.42] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5132.54 → 5142.80] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5149.80 → 5150.80] Amen.
[5150.80 → 5151.40] Amen.
[5151.40 → 5151.80] Amen.
[5179.80 → 5180.80] Amen.
