[1137.02 → 1138.14] You may be seated.
[1138.14 → 1151.18] Our time of confession this morning comes from a litany for World Hunger Sunday.
[1151.62 → 1154.50] So please do follow the litany on the screen.
[1157.68 → 1163.90] Welcoming God, you invite us to the feast of both heaven and earth, to your table of plenty.
[1164.70 → 1166.62] You provide for all that we need.
[1168.14 → 1174.28] You can take us blind in Christ, and seat us next to him at the table.
[1175.16 → 1178.56] The riches of your praise are ours to be loved.
[1180.02 → 1182.66] But your table is not just for us.
[1183.26 → 1187.90] Your banquet is for the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind.
[1188.78 → 1190.00] You remember the poor.
[1190.72 → 1192.74] You are the hope of the afflicted.
[1193.84 → 1196.44] You call us for our handwork.
[1196.44 → 1201.78] You say you created us in Christ Jesus to do good for the works.
[1202.46 → 1205.44] You have prepared those works in your hands.
[1206.58 → 1212.24] You say that if we hunger and thirst for righteousness, that we will be satisfied.
[1212.24 → 1216.04] This is the feast of heaven and earth.
[1216.26 → 1218.96] Let this be all that we need.
[1221.26 → 1228.12] Loving God, we confess that we are often very vocal about helping the poor, but our actions
[1228.12 → 1229.50] do not match our words.
[1230.38 → 1231.94] Forgive us this hypocrisy.
[1231.94 → 1239.62] Let your love flow through us and do immeasurably more that we can even ask or imagine.
[1239.62 → 1240.62] Amen.
[1240.62 → 1241.62] Amen.
[1241.62 → 1250.00] And to you, God of plenty, be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, throughout all generations,
[1250.56 → 1252.06] forever and ever.
[1252.06 → 1252.96] Amen.
[1252.96 → 1264.96] One function.
[1265.06 → 1269.02] Orebro

[1274.06 → 1279.06] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1280.06 → 1285.24] He is telling things we will say together.
[1285.88 → 1291.44] We will feast and we go home.
[1291.44 → 1299.44] We will not be burned by the fire.
[1300.44 → 1304.44] He is the Lord our God.
[1305.44 → 1310.44] We are not consumed by the fire.
[1311.44 → 1317.44] A better protected gathered love.
[1317.44 → 1323.44] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[1324.44 → 1328.44] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1329.44 → 1334.44] He has done great things we will say together.
[1335.44 → 1340.44] We will feast and we go home.
[1340.44 → 1355.44] In the dark of night before the dawn, my soul will not be afraid.
[1355.44 → 1361.64] For the promised morning of my God
[1361.64 → 1368.74] O God of Jacob, be my strength
[1368.74 → 1375.18] We will feast in the house of Zion
[1375.18 → 1380.70] We will sing with our hearts restored
[1380.70 → 1386.40] We have done great things we will sing together
[1386.40 → 1392.70] We will feast and wait no more
[1392.70 → 1400.36] Every vow we've broken and betrayed
[1400.36 → 1406.70] You are the big, the one
[1406.70 → 1412.52] And from the garden to the grave
[1412.52 → 1418.92] By dust together brings shalom
[1418.92 → 1426.28] We will feast in the house of Zion
[1426.28 → 1430.70] We will sing with our hearts restored
[1430.70 → 1436.70] Yes, done great things we will sing together
[1436.70 → 1442.70] We will feast and wait no more
[1442.70 → 1452.70] The children are dismissed to go to Kids Life
[1452.70 → 1459.70] May you have a good time together with your teachers
[1459.70 → 1481.70] Good morning
[1481.70 → 1482.70] Good morning
[1482.70 → 1486.36] Before we open God's word together
[1486.36 → 1487.86] Please join me in prayer
[1487.86 → 1496.98] Creator God, we thank you for gathering us together
[1496.98 → 1497.98] To worship
[1497.98 → 1501.10] We thank you for your word
[1501.10 → 1504.66] We pray that your spirit will be at work
[1504.66 → 1507.16] In our hearts and our minds
[1507.16 → 1509.82] As we hear for your hope
[1509.82 → 1512.02] And your will for our lives
[1512.02 → 1513.94] And for all creation
[1513.94 → 1516.32] In your name we pray, amen
[1516.32 → 1524.98] So the words of the passage will be up on the screen
[1524.98 → 1526.82] But, I think
[1526.82 → 1529.68] But you can also turn in your Bibles
[1529.68 → 1530.34] If you would like
[1530.34 → 1532.74] To Deuteronomy chapter 10
[1532.74 → 1534.62] Verse 17 to 21
[1534.62 → 1541.58] For the Lord your God
[1541.58 → 1545.24] Is God of gods and Lord of lords
[1545.24 → 1548.80] The great God, mighty and awesome
[1548.80 → 1551.32] Who shows no partiality
[1551.32 → 1553.76] And accepts no bribes
[1553.76 → 1556.08] He defends the cause
[1556.08 → 1557.80] Of the fatherless and the widow
[1557.80 → 1561.46] And loves the foreigner residing among you
[1561.46 → 1564.46] Giving them food and clothing
[1564.46 → 1568.66] And you are to love those who are foreigners
[1568.66 → 1572.28] For you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt
[1572.28 → 1574.90] Fear the Lord your God
[1574.90 → 1576.38] And serve him
[1576.38 → 1578.84] Hold fast to him
[1578.84 → 1581.28] And take your oaths in his name
[1581.28 → 1584.24] He is the one you praise
[1584.24 → 1586.08] He is your God
[1586.08 → 1587.66] Who performed for you
[1587.66 → 1589.92] Those great and awesome wonders
[1589.92 → 1592.60] You saw with your own eyes
[1592.60 → 1595.58] This is the word of the Lord
[1595.58 → 1597.36] Thanks be to God
[1597.36 → 1601.18] It's really great to be back here
[1601.18 → 1602.00] With you today
[1602.00 → 1603.34] I have been here before
[1603.34 → 1604.90] But it's been several years
[1604.90 → 1606.14] Since before 2020
[1606.14 → 1608.00] And, so I'm really grateful
[1608.00 → 1609.34] To be able to gather in worship
[1609.34 → 1610.62] With all of you again today
[1610.62 → 1612.86] And as Marian mentioned
[1612.86 → 1614.30] I'm a commissioned pastor
[1614.30 → 1615.76] In the Christian Reformed Church
[1615.76 → 1617.34] And I work out of
[1617.34 → 1618.60] First Christian Reformed Church
[1618.60 → 1619.44] In Vancouver
[1619.44 → 1622.30] As chaplain and refugee support mobilizer
[1622.30 → 1624.62] And I work with
[1624.62 → 1627.18] And I learn from newcomers to Canada
[1627.18 → 1629.14] Who have arrived as refugees
[1629.14 → 1630.82] Through different pathways
[1630.82 → 1632.72] And I work
[1632.72 → 1634.56] I offer a ministry of presence
[1634.56 → 1635.42] And support
[1635.42 → 1636.90] And when I can
[1636.90 → 1638.84] I try and connect these newcomers
[1638.84 → 1640.56] With welcoming communities
[1640.56 → 1641.58] Such as yours
[1641.58 → 1643.10] And it's a great privilege
[1643.10 → 1644.50] To do this work
[1644.50 → 1647.34] And one of the greatest
[1647.34 → 1648.86] Encouragements of my work
[1648.86 → 1650.48] Has been getting to know
[1650.48 → 1651.64] Welcoming communities
[1651.64 → 1653.50] Like Ladder CRC
[1653.50 → 1657.30] So the crisis of global displacement
[1657.30 → 1659.60] I mean the number of refugees
[1659.60 → 1661.06] In the world today
[1661.06 → 1663.62] It can feel very overwhelming
[1663.62 → 1665.68] Millions of people
[1665.68 → 1668.12] But in the midst of that
[1668.12 → 1669.10] One of the things
[1669.10 → 1670.86] That sustains me in my work
[1670.86 → 1672.58] Is getting to see
[1672.58 → 1674.30] The way communities like yours
[1674.30 → 1675.80] And other churches
[1675.80 → 1677.48] I'm especially in touch
[1677.48 → 1678.58] With Christian Reformed churches
[1678.58 → 1679.74] Across BC
[1679.74 → 1681.46] Watching the way
[1681.46 → 1682.62] In which you have
[1682.62 → 1683.90] Opened your arms
[1683.90 → 1685.12] And opened your doors
[1685.12 → 1686.22] To newcomers
[1686.22 → 1688.14] And I've had opportunities
[1688.14 → 1689.64] Over the last many years
[1689.64 → 1690.46] To speak with people
[1690.46 → 1691.40] Like Jerry Barman
[1691.40 → 1693.10] And John and BEV Mantra
[1693.10 → 1694.60] And hear stories
[1694.60 → 1695.78] From your community
[1695.78 → 1696.68] And I have seen
[1696.68 → 1697.54] Some of these stories
[1697.54 → 1698.06] As well
[1698.06 → 1699.66] As I've talked to other people
[1699.66 → 1700.86] As I've visited here
[1700.86 → 1702.96] And your church
[1702.96 → 1704.22] Has such a long
[1704.22 → 1705.36] And beautiful history
[1705.36 → 1706.04] Of welcome
[1706.04 → 1707.70] Starting way before
[1707.70 → 1709.68] I ever knew anything
[1709.68 → 1711.40] About refugee resettlement
[1711.40 → 1712.02] In Canada
[1712.02 → 1714.14] And that's such an amazing history
[1714.14 → 1715.06] And I really hope
[1715.06 → 1715.88] That you are continuing
[1715.88 → 1717.60] To share those stories
[1717.60 → 1718.68] In your community
[1718.68 → 1719.50] Because they are
[1719.50 → 1720.74] Deeply encouraging
[1720.74 → 1722.20] So thank you again
[1722.20 → 1722.88] To all of you
[1722.88 → 1724.48] For being part of that
[1724.48 → 1725.36] In different ways
[1725.36 → 1726.86] And for all the different ways
[1726.86 → 1728.04] That you contribute
[1728.04 → 1729.08] To welcome
[1729.08 → 1732.68] Another thing
[1732.68 → 1735.02] That has always been
[1735.02 → 1736.24] A deep encouragement
[1736.24 → 1737.10] To me
[1737.10 → 1737.98] In my work
[1737.98 → 1738.94] And it's really
[1738.94 → 1739.94] The foundation
[1739.94 → 1741.26] Of my work
[1741.26 → 1742.86] Is the welcome
[1742.86 → 1744.48] That we all receive
[1744.48 → 1745.66] From God
[1745.66 → 1746.90] And the way
[1746.90 → 1748.48] That God calls us
[1748.48 → 1750.22] To share that welcome
[1750.22 → 1751.92] And it's this welcome
[1751.92 → 1752.92] That I want to talk
[1752.92 → 1754.06] A little bit more about
[1754.06 → 1754.54] Today
[1754.54 → 1756.98] So to do that
[1756.98 → 1758.76] We are going to start
[1758.76 → 1759.96] By learning
[1759.96 → 1760.82] How to say
[1760.82 → 1761.68] Welcome
[1761.68 → 1763.36] In Arabic
[1763.36 → 1764.64] Now are there
[1764.64 → 1765.76] Any Arabic speakers
[1765.76 → 1766.42] Here today?
[1769.06 → 1769.58] Okay
[1769.58 → 1770.10] Alright
[1770.10 → 1771.02] I was going to
[1771.02 → 1772.08] Ask them
[1772.08 → 1772.98] If they wanted to come up
[1772.98 → 1774.24] But they're not
[1774.24 → 1775.32] So that's alright
[1775.32 → 1776.38] I know that
[1776.38 → 1777.26] I know that Ladder CRC
[1777.26 → 1778.48] Has been in relationship
[1778.48 → 1779.12] With people
[1779.12 → 1780.08] Around the world
[1780.08 → 1782.10] And that not all of them
[1782.10 → 1782.66] Speak Arabic
[1782.66 → 1784.18] But I know that some of them
[1784.18 → 1785.38] Do speak Arabic
[1785.38 → 1786.44] Or some of the people
[1786.44 → 1787.72] You have been in relationship
[1787.72 → 1788.84] Have spoken Arabic
[1788.84 → 1791.74] And I also speak some Arabic
[1791.74 → 1793.34] And so that's what
[1793.34 → 1794.64] I'm going to teach you today
[1794.64 → 1796.30] So the words will be up
[1796.30 → 1796.82] On the screen
[1796.82 → 1798.86] I'm going to talk a little bit
[1798.86 → 1799.28] About them
[1799.28 → 1800.56] And then we'll practice it
[1800.56 → 1801.08] Together
[1801.08 → 1802.08] Together
[1802.08 → 1802.74] So you can see that
[1802.74 → 1803.88] It's in the Arabic alphabet
[1803.88 → 1804.60] At the top
[1804.60 → 1805.72] And then there's the
[1805.72 → 1807.06] Transliteration
[1807.06 → 1808.18] In the middle
[1808.18 → 1809.76] And then of course
[1809.76 → 1810.40] It's in the
[1810.40 → 1811.90] English at the bottom
[1811.90 → 1814.82] So this is one of the
[1814.82 → 1815.92] Most common ways
[1815.92 → 1817.28] To say welcome
[1817.28 → 1818.34] In Arabic
[1818.34 → 1820.04] And the way you say it
[1820.04 → 1821.36] Is as written in the middle
[1821.36 → 1823.24] Alan WA Alan
[1823.24 → 1826.28] And I've sort of tried
[1826.28 → 1827.30] To highlight those middle
[1827.30 → 1827.90] H's
[1827.90 → 1828.90] The A-H
[1828.90 → 1830.28] And then the S-A-H
[1830.28 → 1832.56] Because those are kind of
[1832.56 → 1833.66] The trickiest letters
[1833.66 → 1835.04] So you have to think of them
[1835.04 → 1835.84] As if you're blowing
[1835.84 → 1837.22] On something hot
[1837.22 → 1839.92] And I think there's
[1839.92 → 1841.50] Probably several
[1841.50 → 1843.04] Maybe native Dutch speakers
[1843.04 → 1843.84] In this congregation
[1843.84 → 1845.52] And I've noticed that
[1845.52 → 1846.88] Dutch people always want to go
[1846.88 → 1848.80] Like in your throat
[1848.80 → 1849.70] This is not
[1849.70 → 1850.52] This is not the word
[1850.52 → 1850.88] It's not
[1850.88 → 1852.28] Alan WA Alan
[1852.28 → 1854.58] It's Alan WA Alan
[1854.58 → 1857.86] So I want you to see
[1857.86 → 1858.68] If you can try it
[1858.68 → 1859.60] A couple of times together
[1859.60 → 1860.62] And if you're brave
[1860.62 → 1861.86] Turn to your neighbour
[1861.86 → 1862.60] And say it
[1862.60 → 1863.32] Say welcome
[1863.32 → 1865.08] Alan WA Alan
[1865.08 → 1866.90] Alan WA Alan
[1866.90 → 1869.20] Alan WA Alan
[1869.20 → 1875.12] Sometimes when I
[1875.12 → 1876.40] When I teach people this
[1876.40 → 1876.92] They're like
[1876.92 → 1877.62] Well the km
[1877.62 → 1878.84] It sounds like you're saying
[1878.84 → 1880.06] Km not ha
[1880.06 → 1881.06] But it really is
[1881.06 → 1881.86] Two different words
[1881.86 → 1883.08] Alan WA Alan
[1883.08 → 1884.18] So great job
[1884.18 → 1885.76] We'll see if you remember this
[1885.76 → 1887.32] Still at the end of the service
[1887.32 → 1888.44] Alan WA Alan
[1888.44 → 1890.30] But I do hope you remember it
[1890.30 → 1892.50] Because you're going to hear
[1892.50 → 1893.62] Alan WA Alan
[1893.62 → 1895.20] Several more times
[1895.20 → 1896.72] Because I want to tell you
[1896.72 → 1897.90] A little bit about
[1897.90 → 1899.22] What it means
[1899.22 → 1900.44] When you break it down
[1900.44 → 1903.16] So if any of you out there
[1903.16 → 1904.44] Are people who love languages
[1904.44 → 1905.90] I'll just say quickly
[1905.90 → 1906.72] That Arabic
[1906.72 → 1908.58] Is part of the Semitic
[1908.58 → 1909.58] Language family
[1909.58 → 1910.60] So it's the same
[1910.60 → 1911.74] Language family
[1911.74 → 1912.50] That Hebrew
[1912.50 → 1913.34] Comes from
[1913.34 → 1914.40] And of course
[1914.40 → 1915.34] The Old Testament
[1915.34 → 1916.64] And Deuteronomy
[1916.64 → 1917.80] Which we just read from
[1917.80 → 1919.56] Were originally written
[1919.56 → 1920.74] In Hebrew
[1920.74 → 1923.12] And in both Arabic
[1923.12 → 1924.02] And Hebrew
[1924.02 → 1925.74] You have root words
[1925.74 → 1927.04] They're often made up of
[1927.04 → 1927.82] Three letters
[1927.82 → 1930.46] And then you add other letters
[1930.46 → 1931.28] To them
[1931.28 → 1932.74] To make other words
[1932.74 → 1934.56] So there are a lot of root words
[1934.56 → 1936.90] And Alan WA Alan
[1936.90 → 1939.86] Is made up of two of these root words
[1939.86 → 1941.30] And that's the next slide
[1941.30 → 1944.74] So the first word
[1944.74 → 1945.66] Alan
[1945.66 → 1948.04] Comes from the root word
[1948.04 → 1948.98] Three letters
[1948.98 → 1949.94] Ahab
[1949.94 → 1951.90] And Ahab means
[1951.90 → 1952.80] Family
[1952.80 → 1955.30] Or one's own people
[1955.30 → 1957.04] The people to which
[1957.04 → 1958.64] You belong
[1958.64 → 1959.94] These are my people
[1959.94 → 1962.34] The second word
[1962.34 → 1963.38] Alan
[1963.38 → 1965.96] Comes from the root word
[1965.96 → 1966.94] Sahel
[1966.94 → 1968.86] It's three letters in Arabic
[1968.86 → 1969.54] Sahel
[1969.54 → 1972.12] And Sahel means
[1972.12 → 1972.76] Easy
[1972.76 → 1974.56] Or in older
[1974.56 → 1975.78] More ancient times
[1975.78 → 1977.36] Arabic is an ancient language
[1977.36 → 1978.62] It could also mean
[1978.62 → 1980.76] Flat level ground
[1980.76 → 1982.34] So ground that is
[1982.34 → 1983.02] Easy
[1983.02 → 1984.36] To walk on
[1984.36 → 1986.64] And so
[1986.64 → 1987.48] One of the things
[1987.48 → 1988.22] I have learned
[1988.22 → 1989.52] Is that when you
[1989.52 → 1990.80] Welcome someone
[1990.80 → 1992.10] By saying to them
[1992.10 → 1993.76] Alan WA Alan
[1993.76 → 1996.12] What you are saying is
[1996.12 → 1998.00] You are now
[1998.00 → 1999.48] Among family
[1999.48 → 2000.98] Think of us
[2000.98 → 2001.88] Think of us as your own
[2001.88 → 2002.56] People
[2002.56 → 2004.70] And you are saying
[2004.70 → 2005.92] Your welcome
[2005.92 → 2006.80] Is easy
[2006.80 → 2007.78] It's not
[2007.78 → 2008.72] A burden
[2008.72 → 2010.00] For us to welcome you
[2010.00 → 2011.80] And when you're with us
[2011.80 → 2013.06] You are walking
[2013.06 → 2013.96] On flat
[2013.96 → 2014.86] Level
[2014.86 → 2015.64] Ground
[2015.64 → 2017.12] Welcoming ground
[2017.12 → 2018.56] You're not going to get
[2018.56 → 2019.38] Tripped up
[2019.38 → 2020.70] Walking on this ground
[2020.70 → 2021.28] With us
[2021.28 → 2022.44] You
[2022.44 → 2023.48] Belong
[2023.48 → 2027.24] So when I learned this
[2027.24 → 2028.68] It was beautiful to me
[2028.68 → 2029.86] For many reasons
[2029.86 → 2031.04] One of which
[2031.04 → 2031.60] Is that
[2031.60 → 2032.62] I think that
[2032.62 → 2033.86] An Alan WA Alan
[2033.86 → 2034.32] Welcome
[2034.32 → 2035.80] Reflects
[2035.80 → 2036.50] The welcome
[2036.50 → 2037.22] Of God
[2037.22 → 2038.80] And it's this
[2038.80 → 2039.56] Kind of welcome
[2039.56 → 2040.62] This welcome
[2040.62 → 2041.48] Of belonging
[2041.48 → 2042.70] That God
[2042.70 → 2043.38] Is calling
[2043.38 → 2044.28] His people to
[2044.28 → 2044.96] Throughout
[2044.96 → 2045.86] Deuteronomy
[2045.86 → 2047.20] All through the book
[2047.20 → 2047.98] And especially
[2047.98 → 2048.82] In the passage
[2048.82 → 2049.68] From chapter 10
[2049.68 → 2050.48] That we just read
[2050.48 → 2053.48] So over the years
[2053.48 → 2054.54] I've heard people
[2054.54 → 2055.70] Be asked
[2055.70 → 2056.94] I've been asked
[2056.94 → 2057.90] I've asked other people
[2057.90 → 2058.46] The question
[2058.46 → 2060.32] What is your favourite book
[2060.32 → 2060.94] In the Bible
[2060.94 → 2062.72] And I have never heard
[2062.72 → 2063.68] Anybody answer
[2063.68 → 2064.56] Deuteronomy
[2064.56 → 2065.40] No
[2065.40 → 2066.30] It's just not
[2066.30 → 2066.96] Not the book
[2066.96 → 2067.72] That people love
[2067.72 → 2069.20] Because it doesn't
[2069.20 → 2070.30] Always seem like
[2070.30 → 2071.50] A very interesting
[2071.50 → 2073.28] Or inspiring reading
[2073.28 → 2074.88] It's basically
[2074.88 → 2076.34] A series of speeches
[2076.34 → 2077.12] That were given
[2077.12 → 2078.46] By the prophet Moses
[2078.46 → 2079.82] And it's speeches
[2079.82 → 2080.96] About histories
[2080.96 → 2082.50] And place names
[2082.50 → 2084.56] And lots of commands
[2084.56 → 2085.56] And laws
[2085.56 → 2086.64] Some of which
[2086.64 → 2087.72] Don't really seem
[2087.72 → 2088.66] To make a lot of sense
[2088.66 → 2089.54] To us when we read
[2089.54 → 2089.98] Them today
[2089.98 → 2093.02] But at its centre
[2093.02 → 2094.20] Deuteronomy
[2094.20 → 2095.20] Is a record
[2095.20 → 2096.28] Of a covenant
[2096.28 → 2097.92] Renewal ceremony
[2097.92 → 2099.24] So it's a renewal
[2099.24 → 2100.30] Of promises
[2100.30 → 2101.86] Between God
[2101.86 → 2102.98] And God's people
[2102.98 → 2105.36] Because at the time
[2105.36 → 2106.04] That Deuteronomy
[2106.04 → 2106.60] Was written
[2106.60 → 2108.00] God's people
[2108.00 → 2109.38] Had recently made
[2109.38 → 2110.04] Their exodus
[2110.04 → 2110.76] From Egypt
[2110.76 → 2112.20] They'd been freed
[2112.20 → 2113.24] As slaves
[2113.24 → 2114.00] From Egypt
[2114.00 → 2115.66] And they've been
[2115.66 → 2116.80] Wandering around
[2116.80 → 2117.36] The desert
[2117.36 → 2118.62] For 40 years
[2118.62 → 2120.42] And they're asking
[2120.42 → 2122.22] A lot of questions
[2122.22 → 2124.72] Where are we going?
[2125.30 → 2126.90] Why are we here?
[2127.54 → 2129.40] And who are we?
[2130.44 → 2131.92] And so Deuteronomy
[2131.92 → 2132.62] Is a book
[2132.62 → 2133.76] That is reminding
[2133.76 → 2134.76] God's people
[2134.76 → 2136.72] Of some core truths
[2136.72 → 2138.46] And this is the next slide
[2138.46 → 2140.72] Deuteronomy
[2140.72 → 2141.50] Is reminding
[2141.50 → 2142.34] God's people
[2142.34 → 2143.68] Number one
[2143.68 → 2145.14] Where they come from
[2145.14 → 2147.58] That they were slaves
[2147.58 → 2148.52] And foreigners
[2148.52 → 2149.36] In Egypt
[2149.36 → 2151.20] Number two
[2151.20 → 2152.52] Where they're going
[2152.52 → 2154.32] The promised land
[2154.32 → 2156.02] A place of belonging
[2156.02 → 2156.80] For them
[2156.80 → 2158.98] Number three
[2158.98 → 2160.74] Why they're here
[2160.74 → 2162.32] What is their purpose
[2162.32 → 2163.08] On earth?
[2163.08 → 2164.96] And number four
[2164.96 → 2166.48] Who they are
[2166.48 → 2168.12] In relation to God
[2168.12 → 2170.00] In relation to others
[2170.00 → 2171.12] Not just in relation
[2171.12 → 2171.70] To each other
[2171.70 → 2172.60] In relation to others
[2172.60 → 2173.94] And in relation
[2173.94 → 2176.10] To all creation
[2176.10 → 2178.92] And all wrapped up
[2178.92 → 2179.76] In the answers
[2179.76 → 2181.12] To these four questions
[2181.12 → 2183.32] Is God's call
[2183.32 → 2184.62] To his people
[2184.62 → 2185.82] To love God
[2185.82 → 2187.50] And to love others
[2187.50 → 2189.16] Especially others
[2189.16 → 2190.00] Who are different
[2190.00 → 2190.60] From them
[2190.60 → 2192.24] Others who are foreigners
[2192.24 → 2194.12] Others who are strangers
[2194.12 → 2196.06] And others who have been
[2196.06 → 2197.88] Displaced from their homes
[2197.88 → 2200.70] Now some of you
[2200.70 → 2201.32] Might know
[2201.32 → 2202.48] Or have heard of
[2202.48 → 2203.30] Someone named
[2203.30 → 2204.56] Mark Glanville
[2204.56 → 2206.30] Mark was a pastor
[2206.30 → 2207.28] At Willoughby Christian
[2207.28 → 2208.42] Reform Church
[2208.42 → 2209.10] In Langley
[2209.10 → 2210.44] Then he was a pastor
[2210.44 → 2211.30] In Vancouver
[2211.30 → 2212.50] And he's now
[2212.50 → 2213.04] A professor
[2213.04 → 2214.30] At Regent College
[2214.30 → 2215.10] In Vancouver
[2215.10 → 2216.18] And he's also
[2216.18 → 2216.80] My neighbour
[2216.80 → 2217.84] In East Vancouver
[2217.84 → 2218.28] Actually
[2218.28 → 2220.56] And Mark
[2220.56 → 2221.70] Is an expert
[2221.70 → 2222.68] On the book
[2222.68 → 2223.50] Of Deuteronomy
[2223.50 → 2225.30] And a couple of years ago
[2225.30 → 2226.78] He released a book
[2226.78 → 2227.70] With his brother
[2227.70 → 2230.52] Called Refuge Reimagined
[2230.52 → 2232.08] Biblical Kinship
[2232.08 → 2233.74] In Global Politics
[2233.74 → 2235.90] Refuge Reimagined
[2235.90 → 2238.52] In this book
[2238.52 → 2240.52] Mark notes that
[2240.52 → 2242.48] The Hebrew word
[2242.48 → 2243.52] For stranger
[2243.52 → 2246.14] Appears 22 times
[2246.14 → 2246.98] In the book
[2246.98 → 2247.84] Of Deuteronomy
[2247.84 → 2250.20] And almost all
[2250.20 → 2251.02] Of those times
[2251.02 → 2252.48] It is in reference
[2252.48 → 2253.64] To how
[2253.64 → 2255.06] The people of God
[2255.06 → 2256.26] Are supposed to
[2256.26 → 2257.60] Treat these strangers
[2257.60 → 2260.00] And of course
[2260.00 → 2260.82] One of the key
[2260.82 → 2261.76] Passages then
[2261.76 → 2262.32] For this
[2262.32 → 2263.64] Is Deuteronomy 10
[2263.64 → 2264.70] 17 to 21
[2264.70 → 2266.20] Which we just read
[2266.20 → 2268.72] And in this passage
[2268.72 → 2270.34] Moses tells the people
[2270.34 → 2272.92] God loves the stranger
[2272.92 → 2274.20] Residing among you
[2274.20 → 2276.48] And you are to love
[2276.48 → 2277.50] That stranger
[2277.50 → 2279.32] For you yourselves
[2279.32 → 2280.44] Were strangers
[2280.44 → 2281.42] In Egypt
[2281.42 → 2284.40] So as Mark Glanville
[2284.40 → 2284.78] Writes
[2284.78 → 2286.34] This passage
[2286.34 → 2287.46] Shows us
[2287.46 → 2288.18] A connection
[2288.18 → 2289.82] Between God's love
[2289.82 → 2290.54] For his people
[2290.54 → 2291.92] God's love
[2291.92 → 2292.66] For the stranger
[2292.66 → 2294.36] And his people's
[2294.36 → 2295.56] Love for the stranger
[2295.56 → 2297.08] So God's love
[2297.08 → 2297.80] For his people
[2297.80 → 2298.78] God's love
[2298.78 → 2299.52] For the stranger
[2299.52 → 2300.92] And his people's
[2300.92 → 2301.76] Love for the stranger
[2301.76 → 2303.72] These are all connected
[2303.72 → 2306.50] And the word
[2306.50 → 2307.58] That Deuteronomy
[2307.58 → 2308.38] Uses here
[2308.38 → 2309.26] For love
[2309.26 → 2310.76] Was a word
[2310.76 → 2311.48] That was used
[2311.48 → 2312.62] More generally
[2312.62 → 2314.02] In that area
[2314.02 → 2315.00] In that time
[2315.00 → 2315.72] In the ancient
[2315.72 → 2316.28] Near East
[2316.28 → 2317.24] In the time of Moses
[2317.24 → 2318.68] And it was used
[2318.68 → 2319.20] Often
[2319.20 → 2320.66] To express
[2320.66 → 2321.56] A commitment
[2321.56 → 2323.20] Between two nations
[2323.20 → 2324.48] Between two countries
[2324.48 → 2324.98] Actually
[2324.98 → 2326.68] It was used to express
[2326.68 → 2328.34] The strongest promise
[2328.34 → 2329.04] Between them
[2329.04 → 2329.90] That love
[2329.90 → 2330.84] Isn't really a word
[2330.84 → 2331.52] We use now
[2331.52 → 2332.14] When we're talking
[2332.14 → 2333.60] About diplomatic relations
[2333.60 → 2334.52] Between countries
[2334.52 → 2335.84] But this was a word
[2335.84 → 2336.80] That they used
[2336.80 → 2338.76] So when verse 18
[2338.76 → 2339.78] Says that God
[2339.78 → 2341.26] Loves the stranger
[2341.26 → 2343.22] We actually see
[2343.22 → 2344.22] That God is making
[2344.22 → 2345.06] A commitment
[2345.06 → 2346.40] To that stranger
[2346.40 → 2347.72] He's making
[2347.72 → 2348.46] A promise
[2348.46 → 2349.52] Of faithfulness
[2349.52 → 2350.88] To the stranger
[2350.88 → 2353.48] And in that time
[2353.48 → 2354.78] When nations
[2354.78 → 2355.68] Made these commitments
[2355.68 → 2356.42] To one another
[2356.42 → 2358.12] These covenant treaties
[2358.12 → 2360.48] They used the language
[2360.48 → 2361.22] Of what Mark
[2361.22 → 2363.06] Calls kinship
[2363.06 → 2364.80] So kinship
[2364.80 → 2366.34] Meaning family
[2366.34 → 2368.22] But it's not just family
[2368.22 → 2369.16] In terms of whom
[2369.16 → 2369.88] You're related to
[2369.88 → 2370.46] By blood
[2370.46 → 2372.52] It's actually family
[2372.52 → 2373.54] In the sense
[2373.54 → 2374.82] Of belonging
[2374.82 → 2376.52] So family
[2376.52 → 2377.44] In the sense
[2377.44 → 2378.96] Of the deepest connection
[2378.96 → 2380.20] That you can have
[2380.20 → 2381.50] With another human being
[2381.50 → 2383.32] Kinship
[2383.32 → 2384.66] Also is meant
[2384.66 → 2385.44] To describe
[2385.44 → 2386.38] The relationship
[2386.38 → 2387.94] That God has
[2387.94 → 2389.16] With his people
[2389.16 → 2391.54] And so when the word
[2391.54 → 2393.26] Love is used here
[2393.26 → 2394.68] We are meant
[2394.68 → 2395.50] To understand
[2395.50 → 2396.92] That the stranger
[2396.92 → 2398.34] Is meant to be brought
[2398.34 → 2400.42] Into the kinship
[2400.42 → 2401.34] Relationship
[2401.34 → 2402.82] Between God
[2402.82 → 2403.90] And God's people
[2403.90 → 2404.70] The stranger
[2404.70 → 2405.90] Doesn't stand outside
[2405.90 → 2407.24] Of it and be loved
[2407.24 → 2408.00] The stranger
[2408.00 → 2409.76] Is within that relationship
[2409.76 → 2412.88] But this relationship
[2412.88 → 2413.74] These promises
[2413.74 → 2414.64] It's not
[2414.64 → 2415.56] It's not a piece
[2415.56 → 2416.18] Of paper
[2416.18 → 2417.96] Signed by two groups
[2417.96 → 2419.02] Full of legal
[2419.02 → 2419.60] Language
[2419.60 → 2421.62] Instead it is
[2421.62 → 2423.04] An emotional connection
[2423.04 → 2424.12] It's a heart
[2424.12 → 2425.04] Connection
[2425.04 → 2426.14] Of promises
[2426.14 → 2427.46] Between again
[2427.46 → 2428.08] God
[2428.08 → 2429.42] God's people
[2429.42 → 2430.54] And the stranger
[2430.54 → 2433.34] To use the language
[2433.34 → 2434.42] Of Deuteronomy 10
[2434.42 → 2435.98] Our mighty
[2435.98 → 2437.14] And awesome God
[2437.14 → 2438.84] Ties himself
[2438.84 → 2439.74] To the stranger
[2439.74 → 2441.60] And he calls us
[2441.60 → 2442.58] To do the same
[2442.58 → 2443.96] To follow his
[2443.96 → 2444.74] Example
[2444.74 → 2445.48] In this
[2445.48 → 2448.28] But God
[2448.28 → 2449.52] Knows that this
[2449.52 → 2450.10] Tying
[2450.10 → 2451.24] This promise
[2451.24 → 2452.52] It's not always
[2452.52 → 2453.60] An easy task
[2453.60 → 2455.92] The book of Samuel
[2455.92 → 2457.30] Second Samuel
[2457.30 → 2457.78] Says
[2457.78 → 2459.20] In the spring
[2459.20 → 2460.16] When the
[2460.16 → 2460.92] In the time
[2460.92 → 2461.60] When the kings
[2461.60 → 2462.56] Go off to war
[2462.56 → 2464.28] So every spring
[2464.28 → 2464.88] The kings
[2464.88 → 2465.78] Go off to war
[2465.78 → 2466.68] Every spring
[2466.68 → 2468.62] War was a constant
[2468.62 → 2469.72] Part of life
[2469.72 → 2470.54] In the time
[2470.54 → 2471.16] Of Moses
[2471.16 → 2472.42] Conflict
[2472.42 → 2473.74] Really between nations
[2473.74 → 2474.38] Conflict
[2474.38 → 2475.14] Was endless
[2475.14 → 2476.88] People were always
[2476.88 → 2477.82] Being displaced
[2477.82 → 2479.38] Becoming refugees
[2479.38 → 2481.64] Nations were afraid
[2481.64 → 2482.58] Of each other
[2482.58 → 2485.00] But in contrast
[2485.00 → 2485.62] To this
[2485.62 → 2486.64] The people of God
[2486.64 → 2487.50] Even though they were
[2487.50 → 2488.72] Also often involved
[2488.72 → 2489.64] In this conflict
[2489.64 → 2491.48] They were called
[2491.48 → 2492.92] To a different way
[2492.92 → 2495.28] A way of welcome
[2495.28 → 2496.88] They were called
[2496.88 → 2498.18] To say to those
[2498.18 → 2499.46] Displaced around them
[2499.46 → 2501.88] Those looking for refuge
[2501.88 → 2502.92] At their gates
[2502.92 → 2504.60] Alan
[2504.60 → 2505.56] Catalan
[2505.56 → 2507.52] You are now
[2507.52 → 2508.46] Among family
[2508.46 → 2510.28] And your welcome
[2510.28 → 2511.28] Is not
[2511.28 → 2512.08] A burden
[2512.08 → 2515.10] And God knew
[2515.10 → 2516.28] That this was not
[2516.28 → 2517.12] A simple
[2517.12 → 2518.24] Or an easy
[2518.24 → 2519.52] Call to his people
[2519.52 → 2521.32] But God
[2521.32 → 2521.98] Has never
[2521.98 → 2522.90] Promised us
[2522.90 → 2523.82] That his call
[2523.82 → 2524.66] On our lives
[2524.66 → 2525.60] Is going to be
[2525.60 → 2526.64] Simple or easy
[2526.64 → 2528.64] But he has always
[2528.64 → 2529.46] Promised us
[2529.46 → 2530.14] That it will be
[2530.14 → 2531.48] A good call
[2531.48 → 2534.36] So as Mark Glanville
[2534.36 → 2534.72] Writes
[2534.72 → 2535.32] And this will be
[2535.32 → 2536.30] Up on the next slide
[2536.30 → 2538.60] The challenge
[2538.60 → 2539.52] Before us
[2539.52 → 2540.92] Is above all
[2540.92 → 2542.50] A spiritual one
[2542.50 → 2544.46] Scripture's call
[2544.46 → 2545.84] To enfold the stranger
[2545.84 → 2547.44] Is an invitation
[2547.44 → 2549.28] Into a knowledge
[2549.28 → 2550.04] Of God
[2550.04 → 2552.10] A theological process
[2552.10 → 2554.56] And it is an invitation
[2554.56 → 2556.04] To know God
[2556.04 → 2558.28] A spiritual process
[2558.28 → 2561.12] The theological
[2561.12 → 2562.84] And spiritual process
[2562.84 → 2563.52] Of growing
[2563.52 → 2564.28] In knowledge
[2564.28 → 2564.86] Of God
[2564.86 → 2565.72] And growing
[2565.72 → 2566.70] To know God
[2566.70 → 2568.56] Continues all the way
[2568.56 → 2569.78] Through the Old Testament
[2569.78 → 2571.52] And it is fulfilled
[2571.52 → 2572.50] In Jesus
[2572.50 → 2573.86] Jesus
[2573.86 → 2575.20] Who at the very
[2575.20 → 2576.68] Centre of his being
[2576.68 → 2578.38] Was who the people
[2578.38 → 2579.00] Of God
[2579.00 → 2580.46] Were always called
[2580.46 → 2581.08] To be
[2581.08 → 2582.00] From the beginning
[2582.00 → 2584.14] Jesus
[2584.14 → 2585.68] Who erased
[2585.68 → 2586.44] Divisions
[2586.44 → 2587.66] Between Jews
[2587.66 → 2588.84] And non-Jews
[2588.84 → 2590.54] Who broke down
[2590.54 → 2591.92] Walls of hostility
[2591.92 → 2593.72] Who expanded
[2593.72 → 2594.76] The borders
[2594.76 → 2595.52] Of family
[2595.52 → 2596.92] And said to his
[2596.92 → 2597.50] Disciples
[2597.50 → 2598.18] In scripture
[2598.18 → 2599.76] You are my brothers
[2599.76 → 2601.64] You are my sisters
[2601.64 → 2603.56] You are my mother
[2603.56 → 2606.06] Jesus who shared
[2606.06 → 2606.72] A table
[2606.72 → 2607.58] With people
[2607.58 → 2608.72] Who nobody else
[2608.72 → 2609.60] Wanted to eat with
[2609.60 → 2611.54] Who died on the cross
[2611.54 → 2612.66] And rose again
[2612.66 → 2613.32] From the dead
[2613.32 → 2614.96] So that the powers
[2614.96 → 2615.58] Of evil
[2615.58 → 2616.62] The powers
[2616.62 → 2617.82] That create war
[2617.82 → 2618.92] And conflict
[2618.92 → 2620.12] And rip people
[2620.12 → 2620.96] From their homes
[2620.96 → 2621.96] The powers
[2621.96 → 2622.46] Of death
[2622.46 → 2623.12] And destruction
[2623.12 → 2624.44] That create refugees
[2624.44 → 2626.22] Jesus died
[2626.22 → 2626.98] And rose again
[2626.98 → 2628.90] So that those powers
[2628.90 → 2630.02] Would be defeated
[2630.02 → 2631.50] And so that
[2631.50 → 2632.98] All creation
[2632.98 → 2634.26] Would be restored
[2634.26 → 2635.62] To new life
[2635.62 → 2638.78] And while we wait
[2638.78 → 2639.54] For that day
[2639.54 → 2640.44] When Jesus
[2640.44 → 2641.16] Comes again
[2641.16 → 2642.26] And we will see
[2642.26 → 2643.58] The complete fullness
[2643.58 → 2644.60] Of welcome
[2644.60 → 2645.74] And reconciliation
[2645.74 → 2647.62] We are called
[2647.62 → 2648.48] To work
[2648.48 → 2649.70] And to witness
[2649.70 → 2650.84] And to learn
[2650.84 → 2653.06] And I think
[2653.06 → 2653.92] That we learn
[2653.92 → 2655.78] Not just by welcoming
[2655.78 → 2658.68] But by being welcomed
[2658.68 → 2660.06] And I'm sure
[2660.06 → 2660.78] That many of you
[2660.78 → 2661.16] Out there
[2661.16 → 2662.22] Could tell stories
[2662.22 → 2662.86] Of the ways
[2662.86 → 2663.50] In which you
[2663.50 → 2664.42] Have been welcomed
[2664.42 → 2665.42] And I hope
[2665.42 → 2666.00] That you share
[2666.00 → 2666.56] Those stories
[2666.56 → 2667.20] With each other
[2667.20 → 2669.40] But your stories
[2669.40 → 2670.28] Are not mine
[2670.28 → 2670.72] To tell
[2670.72 → 2672.08] And, so I think
[2672.08 → 2672.86] One of the best
[2672.86 → 2673.60] Things I can do
[2673.60 → 2674.98] Now is to share
[2674.98 → 2675.82] One of my own
[2675.82 → 2676.44] Stories
[2676.44 → 2678.94] So this story
[2678.94 → 2679.52] Goes back
[2679.52 → 2681.02] Over a decade ago
[2681.02 → 2682.98] And across the world
[2682.98 → 2683.98] To the Middle East
[2683.98 → 2685.00] And North Africa
[2685.00 → 2688.12] It begins in Tunisia
[2688.12 → 2690.14] Where in 2011
[2690.14 → 2692.02] The people of Tunisia
[2692.02 → 2693.96] Rose up in protest
[2693.96 → 2695.54] Against a government
[2695.54 → 2697.16] And a police force
[2697.16 → 2698.36] And a system
[2698.36 → 2700.02] That seemed only
[2700.02 → 2700.86] To exist
[2700.86 → 2702.14] To oppress them
[2702.14 → 2704.50] And their protests
[2704.50 → 2706.02] Were the spark
[2706.02 → 2707.10] That lit a fire
[2707.10 → 2708.10] That spread
[2708.10 → 2709.62] Across the Middle East
[2709.62 → 2711.98] People in countries
[2711.98 → 2713.02] Across the region
[2713.02 → 2714.88] Felt humiliated
[2714.88 → 2716.30] And harassed
[2716.30 → 2717.74] And beaten down
[2717.74 → 2718.96] By their governments
[2718.96 → 2721.04] They felt like
[2721.04 → 2721.66] Their governments
[2721.66 → 2722.38] Treated them
[2722.38 → 2723.48] As less than
[2723.48 → 2724.38] Human beings
[2724.38 → 2726.24] And in response
[2726.24 → 2727.48] Anti-government
[2727.48 → 2728.86] Protests broke out
[2728.86 → 2729.62] In country
[2729.62 → 2730.54] After country
[2730.54 → 2731.42] After country
[2731.42 → 2732.62] In what we
[2732.62 → 2733.70] Now sometimes
[2733.70 → 2735.02] Call the Arab Spring
[2735.02 → 2737.50] So a little over
[2737.50 → 2738.08] One month
[2738.08 → 2739.16] After those protests
[2739.16 → 2740.16] Hit Tunisia
[2740.16 → 2742.24] Sorry
[2742.24 → 2743.12] Yeah after the protests
[2743.12 → 2744.12] Started in Tunisia
[2744.12 → 2745.40] Those protests
[2745.40 → 2746.42] Hit Egypt
[2746.42 → 2747.56] Where I was living
[2747.56 → 2749.44] And they hit
[2749.44 → 2750.18] With a force
[2750.18 → 2751.20] That nobody
[2751.20 → 2752.54] Including the
[2752.54 → 2753.46] Egyptian government
[2753.46 → 2754.34] Saw coming
[2754.34 → 2756.84] So by that time
[2756.84 → 2757.88] I had been living
[2757.88 → 2758.74] In the same
[2758.74 → 2759.36] Neighbourhood
[2759.36 → 2760.18] Of Cairo
[2760.18 → 2761.34] The capital of Egypt
[2761.34 → 2763.24] For about three years
[2763.24 → 2765.00] So I knew a lot
[2765.00 → 2765.62] Of my neighbours
[2765.62 → 2767.02] And a lot of them
[2767.02 → 2767.64] Knew me
[2767.64 → 2768.78] And they knew
[2768.78 → 2769.74] That I was
[2769.74 → 2770.78] Partly responsible
[2770.78 → 2772.30] For all of these
[2772.30 → 2773.50] American and Canadian
[2773.50 → 2774.78] University students
[2774.78 → 2776.34] That kept showing up
[2776.34 → 2777.10] To live in their
[2777.10 → 2777.98] Neighbourhood for a few
[2777.98 → 2778.46] Months
[2778.46 → 2779.82] And to study abroad
[2779.82 → 2780.74] In the Middle East
[2780.74 → 2782.82] And my neighbours
[2782.82 → 2784.26] Had welcomed us
[2784.26 → 2785.74] We were foreigners
[2785.74 → 2786.86] We were strangers
[2786.86 → 2787.94] In their neighbourhood
[2787.94 → 2789.76] We barely spoke
[2789.76 → 2790.46] Their language
[2790.46 → 2791.50] And we were just
[2791.50 → 2793.26] Starting to understand
[2793.26 → 2794.06] Their culture
[2794.06 → 2796.32] But they invited us
[2796.32 → 2797.20] In for tea
[2797.20 → 2798.52] And for meals
[2798.52 → 2800.14] And for dance parties
[2800.14 → 2802.62] And my neighbours
[2802.62 → 2803.98] Did all of this
[2803.98 → 2804.96] In the middle
[2804.96 → 2805.66] Of a government
[2805.66 → 2806.92] That really was
[2806.92 → 2808.04] Crushing them
[2808.04 → 2809.80] Because when the
[2809.80 → 2810.54] Protests started
[2810.54 → 2812.22] In January 2011
[2812.22 → 2813.72] The government
[2813.72 → 2814.40] Of Egypt
[2814.40 → 2815.66] Did what
[2815.66 → 2816.92] Authoritarian regimes
[2816.92 → 2818.24] Do when faced
[2818.24 → 2818.92] With dissent
[2818.92 → 2820.72] They cracked down
[2820.72 → 2822.26] And the next slide
[2822.26 → 2822.82] Is a photo
[2822.82 → 2823.60] From Cairo
[2823.60 → 2824.64] At that time
[2824.64 → 2825.58] You can see the line
[2825.58 → 2826.84] Of riot police
[2826.84 → 2827.96] And the one protester
[2827.96 → 2828.66] With the sign
[2828.66 → 2832.20] So the Egyptian government
[2832.20 → 2833.50] Arrested
[2833.50 → 2834.44] And beat
[2834.44 → 2835.64] And tortured
[2835.64 → 2836.66] Protesters
[2836.66 → 2838.16] Some of the protesters
[2838.16 → 2839.22] Disappeared
[2839.22 → 2841.30] The government
[2841.30 → 2842.04] Threatened
[2842.04 → 2843.38] The mobile phone companies
[2843.38 → 2845.20] And they got cell phone service
[2845.20 → 2845.84] Cut off
[2845.84 → 2847.14] Through most of the country
[2847.14 → 2848.64] And they did the same
[2848.64 → 2850.10] With the internet companies
[2850.10 → 2851.42] They shut the internet down
[2851.42 → 2853.10] They instituted
[2853.10 → 2854.22] A military curfew
[2854.22 → 2855.00] So that nobody
[2855.00 → 2855.56] Was allowed
[2855.56 → 2856.32] On the streets
[2856.32 → 2857.68] Between 3pm
[2857.68 → 2858.94] And 8am
[2858.94 → 2861.00] And the police
[2861.00 → 2862.40] Who most people saw
[2862.40 → 2863.94] As corrupt weapons
[2863.94 → 2864.58] Of the government
[2864.58 → 2866.04] Just disappeared
[2866.04 → 2867.10] They were just gone
[2867.10 → 2869.40] And stories started
[2869.40 → 2870.12] To spread
[2870.12 → 2872.20] About gangs of looters
[2872.20 → 2872.94] Taking advantage
[2872.94 → 2873.76] Of the situation
[2873.76 → 2874.94] Taking advantage
[2874.94 → 2875.72] Of the chaos
[2875.72 → 2876.68] And breaking
[2876.68 → 2877.80] Into people's homes
[2877.80 → 2878.94] To beat them
[2878.94 → 2880.22] And to steal from them
[2880.22 → 2881.98] But none of us
[2881.98 → 2882.64] Could call each other
[2882.64 → 2883.36] On our phones
[2883.36 → 2885.56] We couldn't email each other
[2885.56 → 2886.94] Or use any kind of
[2886.94 → 2887.82] Internet apps
[2887.82 → 2889.20] To communicate with each other
[2889.20 → 2891.12] So none of us knew
[2891.12 → 2892.00] Well what's true
[2892.00 → 2892.76] And what's not
[2892.76 → 2894.22] What's actually happening
[2894.22 → 2895.94] We didn't know
[2895.94 → 2897.18] What was going on exactly
[2897.18 → 2898.36] And so there was
[2898.36 → 2899.70] A lot of fear
[2899.70 → 2902.28] But in the middle
[2902.28 → 2903.04] Of all of this
[2903.04 → 2904.38] While rumours spread
[2904.38 → 2905.28] And different groups
[2905.28 → 2906.14] Played games
[2906.14 → 2907.12] With Egypt's future
[2907.12 → 2909.14] My neighbours did
[2909.14 → 2910.30] What neighbours
[2910.30 → 2911.10] In neighbourhoods
[2911.10 → 2912.32] Across Cairo
[2912.32 → 2912.82] Were doing
[2912.82 → 2914.58] They got together
[2914.58 → 2916.14] And they set up
[2916.14 → 2917.12] Roadblocks
[2917.12 → 2918.24] Couches
[2918.24 → 2919.12] Tires
[2919.12 → 2920.36] Chairs
[2920.36 → 2921.60] Old cars
[2921.60 → 2923.18] And they set up
[2923.18 → 2924.12] These roadblocks
[2924.12 → 2925.28] On every street
[2925.28 → 2926.12] That entered
[2926.12 → 2927.40] Into our neighbourhood
[2927.40 → 2928.94] So that nobody
[2928.94 → 2929.92] Could come in
[2929.92 → 2931.08] Or out
[2931.08 → 2932.10] Without talking
[2932.10 → 2932.62] With them
[2932.62 → 2933.86] They were trying
[2933.86 → 2934.50] To make sure
[2934.50 → 2935.42] That if there were
[2935.42 → 2935.86] Looters
[2935.86 → 2936.94] If there were gangs
[2936.94 → 2937.82] That they weren't
[2937.82 → 2938.88] Coming into
[2938.88 → 2939.64] Our neighbourhood
[2939.64 → 2941.50] And so night
[2941.50 → 2942.20] After night
[2942.20 → 2943.02] In spite of
[2943.02 → 2944.16] This military curfew
[2944.16 → 2945.68] They were out there
[2945.68 → 2946.46] And they were out there
[2946.46 → 2947.46] All night long
[2947.46 → 2948.38] And you would be
[2948.38 → 2949.12] Surprised at how
[2949.12 → 2950.52] Cold Cairo can be
[2950.52 → 2951.44] In January
[2951.44 → 2954.28] But they were out there
[2954.28 → 2956.06] Protecting their families
[2956.06 → 2957.50] They were out there
[2957.50 → 2958.86] Protecting their neighbours
[2958.86 → 2960.76] And they were out there
[2960.76 → 2962.16] Protecting us
[2962.16 → 2963.30] The foreigners
[2963.30 → 2964.48] In their midst
[2964.48 → 2966.72] And that was not
[2966.72 → 2967.52] A small thing
[2967.52 → 2968.88] I learned later
[2968.88 → 2969.82] That there were rumours
[2969.82 → 2970.48] Going around
[2970.48 → 2971.90] About how foreigners
[2971.90 → 2972.86] Were spies
[2972.86 → 2974.60] And the Egyptian government
[2974.60 → 2975.36] Was spreading
[2975.36 → 2976.54] All of this propaganda
[2976.54 → 2978.26] About how it was
[2978.26 → 2979.50] Foreigners fault
[2979.50 → 2980.54] That there were protests
[2980.54 → 2980.96] Happening
[2980.96 → 2981.28] You know
[2981.28 → 2982.20] The government's not
[2982.20 → 2983.08] Doing anything wrong
[2983.08 → 2983.88] It's all the fault
[2983.88 → 2984.82] Of foreigners
[2984.82 → 2987.36] So having foreigners
[2987.36 → 2988.50] In their midst
[2988.50 → 2989.84] Was a liability
[2989.84 → 2990.78] In a way
[2990.78 → 2992.24] So in a sense
[2992.24 → 2993.10] We were putting
[2993.10 → 2994.36] Our neighbours at risk
[2994.36 → 2995.40] By being there
[2995.40 → 2997.10] But their protection
[2997.10 → 2997.66] Of us
[2997.66 → 2999.34] Never ever wavered
[2999.34 → 3001.86] So a few nights
[3001.86 → 3002.40] Into this
[3002.40 → 3003.44] Things started
[3003.44 → 3004.66] To feel calmer
[3004.66 → 3005.54] And it started
[3005.54 → 3006.46] To feel safer
[3006.46 → 3008.32] And my co-workers
[3008.32 → 3008.84] And I
[3008.84 → 3009.86] Two Americans
[3009.86 → 3010.54] An Egyptian
[3010.54 → 3011.06] And me
[3011.06 → 3012.60] We wanted to
[3012.60 → 3013.48] Thank our neighbours
[3013.48 → 3015.16] So we boiled
[3015.16 → 3015.76] Some water
[3015.76 → 3016.46] We pulled out
[3016.46 → 3018.00] These little plastic cups
[3018.00 → 3018.96] And some tea
[3018.96 → 3019.74] And some sugar
[3019.74 → 3021.54] And we walked around
[3021.54 → 3022.20] In the dark
[3022.20 → 3023.38] From roadblock
[3023.38 → 3024.28] To roadblock
[3024.28 → 3025.26] To roadblock
[3025.26 → 3027.08] And we did look
[3027.08 → 3027.78] A little bit funny
[3027.78 → 3028.66] Carrying our tray
[3028.66 → 3029.06] Around
[3029.06 → 3030.46] These strangers
[3030.46 → 3031.18] These foreigners
[3031.18 → 3032.58] And people thought
[3032.58 → 3033.60] We were a little bit funny
[3033.60 → 3034.70] But we had some
[3034.70 → 3035.76] Perfect conversations
[3035.76 → 3036.44] With people
[3036.44 → 3039.08] And at the last roadblock
[3039.08 → 3040.84] Just before our hot water
[3040.84 → 3041.68] Ran out
[3041.68 → 3043.48] One of the men
[3043.48 → 3044.16] Who had been there
[3044.16 → 3044.62] All night
[3044.62 → 3045.72] He looked at us
[3045.72 → 3046.94] And he was a little bit puzzled
[3046.94 → 3048.18] And he said
[3048.18 → 3049.94] What are you doing out here?
[3050.60 → 3051.58] Aren't you afraid?
[3053.04 → 3054.40] And we looked at each other
[3054.40 → 3055.58] And we looked at him
[3055.58 → 3056.82] And we said
[3056.82 → 3057.44] No
[3057.44 → 3059.46] Because you're here
[3059.46 → 3060.92] We were afraid
[3060.92 → 3061.90] But then we saw you
[3061.90 → 3063.10] Out here every night
[3063.10 → 3064.90] And we saw how you
[3064.90 → 3065.76] As our neighbour
[3065.76 → 3067.40] Have welcomed us
[3067.40 → 3068.18] And we saw
[3068.18 → 3070.40] How you will protect us
[3070.40 → 3072.02] With the same strength
[3072.02 → 3073.30] That you are protecting
[3073.30 → 3074.00] Your family
[3074.00 → 3076.72] And he looked at us
[3076.72 → 3077.76] And he said
[3077.76 → 3079.64] Alan WA Alan
[3079.64 → 3083.16] To be welcomed
[3083.16 → 3084.08] In that way
[3084.08 → 3084.86] By my neighbour
[3084.86 → 3086.58] Was not something
[3086.58 → 3087.96] That I had earned
[3087.96 → 3088.72] I mean
[3088.72 → 3089.74] I'd never even met
[3089.74 → 3091.42] That particular man before
[3091.42 → 3092.92] I'd never met
[3092.92 → 3093.50] That neighbour
[3093.50 → 3096.00] And I didn't do anything
[3096.00 → 3097.88] To deserve his welcome
[3097.88 → 3099.80] For me
[3099.80 → 3101.18] My neighbours in Cairo
[3101.18 → 3102.60] Reflected to me
[3102.60 → 3103.86] The love of God
[3103.86 → 3106.84] I grew in my understanding
[3106.84 → 3108.10] In my knowledge
[3108.10 → 3109.60] Of the love of God
[3109.60 → 3111.64] Through the stranger love
[3111.64 → 3112.92] That was shown to me
[3112.92 → 3115.58] And this is part of what
[3115.58 → 3116.36] Motivates me
[3116.36 → 3117.66] In the work that I do
[3117.66 → 3120.48] To give even one small part
[3120.48 → 3121.46] Of the welcome
[3121.46 → 3122.72] That was offered to me
[3122.72 → 3123.36] In Egypt
[3123.36 → 3125.20] And to give even one
[3125.20 → 3126.48] Smaller part
[3126.48 → 3127.54] Of the welcome
[3127.54 → 3128.38] That has been
[3128.38 → 3129.96] And is offered to me
[3129.96 → 3130.62] By God
[3130.62 → 3134.30] To give of this welcome
[3134.30 → 3135.18] To say
[3135.18 → 3136.52] Alan WA Alan
[3136.52 → 3138.34] To the people around us
[3138.34 → 3139.52] Is to build
[3139.52 → 3140.66] A new community
[3140.66 → 3142.80] It is to erase the walls
[3142.80 → 3143.50] That the world
[3143.50 → 3144.80] Tells us we should build
[3144.80 → 3147.08] And it is to re-imagine
[3147.08 → 3148.34] What it means
[3148.34 → 3150.22] To expand the boundaries
[3150.22 → 3151.10] Of family
[3151.10 → 3153.10] It is to be able
[3153.10 → 3154.34] To turn to your neighbour
[3154.34 → 3155.84] Whoever they are
[3155.84 → 3157.40] And say to them
[3157.40 → 3158.96] Your welcome
[3158.96 → 3160.76] Is not a burden
[3160.76 → 3163.80] And to just as much
[3163.80 → 3165.20] Fully believe
[3165.20 → 3166.54] That when they say
[3166.54 → 3167.38] Back to you
[3167.38 → 3168.68] Your welcome
[3168.68 → 3169.80] Is not a burden
[3169.80 → 3171.10] They mean it
[3171.10 → 3171.82] And it is true
[3171.82 → 3173.66] Because I know
[3173.66 → 3174.60] That for some of you
[3174.60 → 3175.18] Out there
[3175.18 → 3177.62] This may be a great fear
[3177.62 → 3178.46] That you hold
[3178.46 → 3180.22] That the worst thing
[3180.22 → 3180.84] In the world
[3180.84 → 3182.34] Would be to become
[3182.34 → 3184.04] Dependent on others
[3184.04 → 3186.04] Or in full need
[3186.04 → 3187.36] Of the help of strangers
[3187.36 → 3189.82] But in the community
[3189.82 → 3191.28] Called for in Deuteronomy
[3191.28 → 3192.14] And the community
[3192.14 → 3193.20] Shaped by Jesus
[3193.20 → 3194.72] Each person
[3194.72 → 3195.74] Is dependent
[3195.74 → 3196.68] On the other
[3196.68 → 3198.20] The boundaries
[3198.20 → 3199.00] Between you
[3199.00 → 3199.76] And the stranger
[3199.76 → 3200.64] Are erased
[3200.64 → 3202.50] There is no person
[3202.50 → 3204.00] Helping up here
[3204.00 → 3206.16] And person being helped
[3206.16 → 3207.12] Down there
[3207.12 → 3209.52] Instead you are walking
[3209.52 → 3211.84] On flat level ground
[3211.84 → 3212.50] Together
[3212.50 → 3214.28] And each person
[3214.28 → 3215.30] Says to the other
[3215.30 → 3217.14] I need you
[3217.14 → 3218.62] And I'm here
[3218.62 → 3219.70] When you need me
[3219.70 → 3221.84] And I know that
[3221.84 → 3223.38] This can be intimidating
[3223.38 → 3224.84] Especially when we're
[3224.84 → 3225.52] Talking about
[3225.52 → 3226.76] Language barriers
[3226.76 → 3227.78] And cultural
[3227.78 → 3228.92] And religious differences
[3228.92 → 3230.88] And complete differences
[3230.88 → 3231.82] Of experience
[3231.82 → 3233.72] I know that many times
[3233.72 → 3234.96] I've thought to myself
[3234.96 → 3237.18] Really what do I know
[3237.18 → 3238.70] About what it is
[3238.70 → 3240.14] To become a refugee
[3240.14 → 3241.32] About what it means
[3241.32 → 3242.86] To lose everything
[3242.86 → 3245.68] But even in the middle
[3245.68 → 3246.20] Of that
[3246.20 → 3247.60] We are called
[3247.60 → 3248.24] To the work
[3248.24 → 3249.64] Of faithful welcome
[3249.64 → 3251.22] And we do it together
[3251.22 → 3252.28] And we do it
[3252.28 → 3252.94] In community
[3252.94 → 3253.84] We're not alone
[3253.84 → 3254.32] In this
[3254.32 → 3255.72] We do this
[3255.72 → 3256.42] Over meals
[3256.42 → 3257.24] I'm so glad
[3257.24 → 3257.84] That there are soup
[3257.84 → 3258.22] And buns
[3258.22 → 3259.06] After the service
[3259.06 → 3259.68] I think food
[3259.68 → 3261.12] Is the best place
[3261.12 → 3261.64] To start
[3261.64 → 3262.80] When getting to know
[3262.80 → 3263.74] Someone new
[3263.74 → 3264.56] Or someone different
[3264.56 → 3265.00] Than you
[3265.00 → 3267.16] We do it by sharing stories
[3267.16 → 3268.54] By modelling welcome
[3268.54 → 3270.26] We do it by teaching
[3270.26 → 3271.20] The next generation
[3271.20 → 3273.74] And showing what welcome means
[3273.74 → 3275.68] I told you that I've learned
[3275.68 → 3276.60] A lot from my neighbours
[3276.60 → 3277.92] In Cairo about welcome
[3277.92 → 3279.52] But I've also learned
[3279.52 → 3281.04] So much from communities
[3281.04 → 3281.82] Like yours
[3281.82 → 3282.62] Who again
[3282.62 → 3283.44] Have been doing it
[3283.44 → 3284.26] So much longer
[3284.26 → 3284.92] Than I have
[3284.92 → 3286.40] I've learned from
[3286.40 → 3287.42] Hearing your stories
[3287.42 → 3289.14] From watching your example
[3289.14 → 3290.92] And from being invited
[3290.92 → 3292.52] Into that welcome myself
[3292.52 → 3294.76] Together
[3294.76 → 3296.50] Following that welcoming
[3296.50 → 3297.24] Way of Jesus
[3297.24 → 3298.66] We learn
[3298.66 → 3300.24] And we work
[3300.24 → 3301.26] And we live
[3301.26 → 3302.80] Into this new community
[3302.80 → 3304.16] Shaped
[3304.16 → 3305.40] By a God
[3305.40 → 3306.60] Who says to us
[3306.60 → 3307.78] Every minute
[3307.78 → 3309.28] Of every day
[3309.28 → 3311.24] For as long as you live
[3311.24 → 3313.08] Alan Catalan
[3313.08 → 3315.00] You are among
[3315.00 → 3315.76] Family
[3315.76 → 3317.60] Your welcome
[3317.60 → 3319.54] Is not a burden
[3319.54 → 3321.94] And you belong
[3321.94 → 3323.62] Amen
[3323.62 → 3330.92] Please join me
[3330.92 → 3331.58] In prayer
[3331.58 → 3338.44] God we thank you
[3338.44 → 3339.74] For the welcome
[3339.74 → 3341.00] That you offer us
[3341.00 → 3343.52] We thank you
[3343.52 → 3344.68] For the cloud
[3344.68 → 3345.28] Of witnesses
[3345.28 → 3347.18] That has gone before us
[3347.18 → 3348.98] To model this welcome
[3348.98 → 3351.48] We thank you
[3351.48 → 3352.38] For the work
[3352.38 → 3353.26] And the witness
[3353.26 → 3353.98] And the life
[3353.98 → 3354.66] And the death
[3354.66 → 3355.42] And the resurrection
[3355.42 → 3356.60] Of Jesus
[3356.60 → 3358.12] We thank you
[3358.12 → 3359.10] For the promise
[3359.10 → 3360.12] Of the new creation
[3360.12 → 3362.72] We pray for your
[3362.72 → 3364.28] Strength
[3364.28 → 3365.40] And your wisdom
[3365.40 → 3366.82] As we welcome
[3366.82 → 3368.90] And we pray
[3368.90 → 3369.88] For all of those
[3369.88 → 3371.22] Across the world
[3371.22 → 3372.74] Who have been displaced
[3372.74 → 3374.22] And who are looking
[3374.22 → 3375.02] For a new home
[3375.02 → 3376.54] And a new place
[3376.54 → 3376.98] To belong
[3376.98 → 3378.54] In your name
[3378.54 → 3378.90] We pray
[3378.90 → 3379.50] Amen
[3379.50 → 3390.32] Please rise
[3390.32 → 3390.90] For our song
[3390.90 → 3391.74] Is is' wars
[3391.74 → 3393.74] Amen.
[3421.74 → 3423.74] Amen.
[3451.74 → 3453.74] Amen.
[3481.74 → 3483.74] Amen.
[3511.74 → 3513.74] Amen.
[3541.74 → 3543.74] Amen.
[3557.74 → 3559.74] Amen.
[3559.74 → 3565.74] You may be seated.
[3565.74 → 3573.38] As I mentioned earlier, this is World Hunger Sunday, and our offering today is for World Hunger.
[3573.60 → 3583.70] It is to help people be able to sustain their food resources.
[3584.42 → 3588.14] It is to help teach them how to grow food.
[3588.70 → 3591.98] It is to provide seeds for them and so many other things.
[3591.98 → 3598.00] And so we ask that we would give generously to this.
[3598.34 → 3604.44] And while you are giving, there will be a world review video on.
[3604.66 → 3607.86] And then later on I have another little announcement to make.
[3608.26 → 3609.86] So I invite the deacons to come forward.
[3612.88 → 3614.92] Food can always tell a story.
[3615.72 → 3621.06] In Bangladesh, food is the story of our mothers, tending to compost and turning waste into nutrients.
[3621.06 → 3625.96] As they care for the earth, so they care for our bodies, building our strength and intellect.
[3626.60 → 3628.62] Milan knows the power of food in our village.
[3629.14 → 3633.26] Her chickens and cows help send her son to university, transforming his future.
[3633.64 → 3635.16] Because food educates.
[3636.30 → 3640.14] In Honduras, food is hospitality, a way for us to create plenty.
[3640.78 → 3643.84] Together we grow peppers and raise fish to feed our families.
[3643.84 → 3652.94] Together we deepen Myra's joy, bring stability to the Areas, and crowd outside of Merlin's tortilla shop to support her bold new dream.
[3653.84 → 3655.16] Because food brings income.
[3656.62 → 3658.64] In Malawi, food means resilience.
[3659.36 → 3661.18] Beneath the hot sun we battle the climate.
[3661.80 → 3663.92] But our new farming methods have prevented disaster.
[3664.58 → 3667.08] Now, McDonald's children have a chance for life.
[3667.82 → 3669.78] There are beacons of hope for tomorrow.
[3669.78 → 3671.78] Because food saves.
[3673.10 → 3674.96] Once our stories were defined by hunger.
[3675.44 → 3679.64] But now, with churches like yours sharing the love of God through the right tools and training,
[3679.92 → 3682.74] our stories are inspired by a hunger for good.
[3683.28 → 3687.58] Every story of hunger changed through World Renew was made possible by someone like you.
[3688.18 → 3695.60] A gift of $200 gives a farmer the tools, training, and supplies needed to feed their family for a year.
[3696.46 → 3698.26] Give to meet their hunger today.
[3699.78 → 3726.24] I was going through the World Renew website this week in preparation for this service,
[3726.24 → 3729.42] and I started looking at their resources for churches.
[3730.06 → 3736.00] And so I just want to share with you that they have, it's called Dinner for Good Kit.
[3736.66 → 3740.48] So if you wonder is there's more you could do throughout the year,
[3741.70 → 3744.66] November sometimes is, there's not a lot happening in November,
[3744.66 → 3750.12] November, this allows you an idea to get together, invite others,
[3750.48 → 3754.76] who would maybe go out for a meal, and you would make them a dinner,
[3754.94 → 3759.52] and then they would just donate because you've had them over for this dinner.
[3759.52 → 3764.72] Now it's a little bit more complex than that.
[3764.78 → 3773.24] They actually provide a in this example, they provide a meal from Zambia that one can prepare,
[3773.50 → 3774.90] a recipe and all.
[3774.90 → 3779.12] And if you are interested in doing something like this,
[3779.62 → 3783.96] I have made 30 copies that are on the back table.
[3784.28 → 3787.92] Take one along and just see if it's something you might be interested in.
[3787.98 → 3796.56] It's a really creative way to kind of raise funds for people who do not have food sustainability.
[3796.56 → 3801.66] Would you join me now in prayer?
[3805.68 → 3811.06] Eternal Father, Son, and Spirit, thank you for this time of encouragement from your word and spirit.
[3811.90 → 3816.46] Open our eyes to how you would have us live in light of what we've heard from you this morning.
[3817.18 → 3822.40] Thank you for calling and strengthening Dina in her ministry of welcoming strangers who become friends.
[3822.40 → 3828.50] Continue to care for her, clothing her with wisdom and endurance for this important work.
[3829.16 → 3832.32] Thank you for her gift of preaching and her presence with us today.
[3833.42 → 3836.22] Lord, we are overwhelmed by the needs in our world.
[3836.64 → 3842.80] Humanity cries out for relief from war, food insecurity, random violence, and social injustice.
[3843.68 → 3848.02] We often don't know how to be part of a solution to the atrocities that take place,
[3848.10 → 3850.88] not only across the world, but in our own neighbourhoods.
[3850.88 → 3855.66] And yes, even sometimes within the circle of our family and friends.
[3856.36 → 3860.86] But we do know that bringing these needs to you is the first step towards wholeness.
[3861.56 → 3866.06] And so we bring to you the wars that rage in both the Gaza Strip and Ukraine.
[3866.58 → 3868.92] We lament the deaths of innocent people.
[3869.78 → 3872.90] Fathers who not so long ago provided for their families.
[3873.74 → 3875.76] Children who played happily in the streets.
[3876.08 → 3877.50] And mothers who nurtured them.
[3877.50 → 3880.00] With the psalmist we cry out,
[3880.68 → 3882.60] How long, O Lord, how long?
[3883.04 → 3884.06] Do you hear us?
[3885.06 → 3889.40] Spirit of the living God, hover over those areas with your peace and restoration.
[3890.44 → 3891.76] Heal the wounds of war.
[3893.20 → 3898.04] As later this week we remember former wars that have brought us freedom and those who fought,
[3898.44 → 3901.04] give us grateful hearts for these immense sacrifices.
[3901.04 → 3906.00] May we never become complacent about senseless war and loss of life.
[3906.62 → 3909.78] May life be always sacred to us as it is to you.
[3910.50 → 3915.34] Thank you for the work of World Renew in so many countries helping to alleviate hunger and poverty.
[3916.06 → 3920.52] Thank you that their work changes lives and that we can partner in that work.
[3920.52 → 3924.70] We pray not only for our world but for those here at home.
[3924.70 → 3931.88] Great physician, you have heard our prayers for extended life for Amy and bless you for your gift of healing to her so far.
[3932.44 → 3933.20] Thank you.
[3933.56 → 3936.10] Continue to strengthen her and guide her medical team.
[3937.24 → 3941.44] We are excited with Lorna and Kenny as they anticipate the arrival of their twins.
[3941.86 → 3947.92] May they safely receive two healthy little miracles from your hand and all the joy that new parenthood brings.
[3947.92 → 3956.94] We pray for a good labour and delivery and their trust in you throughout this time and the years ahead as they care for and guide these precious children.
[3959.78 → 3966.26] We praise you along with Art and Wilma for the marriage yesterday of George and Carrie in Langley.
[3967.20 → 3971.82] We thank you for this new chapter and rejoice with them in your goodness and leading.
[3972.36 → 3975.42] In this we are witnesses to your gracious love.
[3975.42 → 3984.32] Finally, we hold before you those in our church circle of family, friends, and fellowship who are sick and shut in.
[3985.04 → 3988.06] We pray especially for two of our most senior seniors.
[3988.76 → 3993.96] Allie, who is in hospital this week, and also Ted, who has been in hospital for a number of weeks.
[3994.78 → 3999.38] May they both be patient in their trials and know that you hold them in your hand.
[3999.38 → 4003.66] We remember all those in our fellowship or families who are grieving.
[4004.80 → 4008.12] Those who are reeling from broken relationships.
[4008.94 → 4010.48] Those who are stuck in addiction.
[4011.56 → 4012.64] Those who are anxious.
[4013.82 → 4018.44] Those who are in a spiritual wilderness or simply weary with life.
[4019.94 → 4024.48] Strengthen those who feel your spirit nudging them but are afraid to trust you.
[4024.48 → 4032.22] We know that you are all compassionate and loving and that your redemption is real and always near.
[4033.00 → 4036.06] May we be encouraging and gracious toward one another.
[4036.48 → 4041.06] Lifting each other up through faithful words, prayer, and deeds.
[4042.08 → 4044.50] Make us light and salt to our neighbours.
[4045.20 → 4048.96] We desire to follow you in obedience and entrust the outcomes to you.
[4048.96 → 4056.54] May we run the race you have set before us with our eyes on Jesus, who is the perfecter and finisher of our faith.
[4057.42 → 4061.10] Make it so, we pray in the powerful name of Jesus.
[4061.80 → 4062.06] Amen.
[4064.28 → 4068.54] Would you please rise as Dina comes up to give us the blessing.
[4068.54 → 4083.64] We are now sent out to live into the welcome of God, and we go with this blessing.
[4085.18 → 4088.72] May God go before you to guide you.
[4089.56 → 4093.02] May God go behind you to protect you.
[4093.84 → 4097.04] May God go beneath you to support you.
[4097.04 → 4101.26] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[4102.14 → 4103.68] Do not be afraid.
[4104.52 → 4107.62] Go in peace to love and serve our God.
[4108.12 → 4109.50] And all God's people say,
[4109.50 → 4110.64] Amen.
[4127.04 → 4142.24] Lord, let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4142.24 → 4155.34] Lord, let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4155.34 → 4168.34] Let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4168.34 → 4182.34] Let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4182.34 → 4197.34] Lord, let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4197.34 → 4211.44] Lord, let your grace, grace from your hand fall on us.
[4211.44 → 4224.46] Let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4224.46 → 4227.44] Let your night, light of your face shine on us.
[4227.54 → 4230.44] Let your light, light of your face shine on us.
[4230.44 → 4239.20] Let your grace fall on us
[4239.20 → 4247.44] Lord, let your love
[4247.44 → 4254.44] Not with no hand come over us
[4254.44 → 4259.76] Lord, let your love
[4259.76 → 4265.76] Not with no hand come over us
[4265.76 → 4271.76] That we made you say
[4271.76 → 4277.76] That we made you cry
[4277.76 → 4284.76] To find your way in the darkest night
[4284.76 → 4290.76] Let your love come over us
[4290.76 → 4298.76] Let your light shine on us
[4298.76 → 4304.76] Let your love come over us
[4304.76 → 4310.76] Let your love come over us
[4310.76 → 4314.76] Let your love come over us
[4314.76 → 4318.76] Let your love come over us
[4318.76 → 4320.76] Amen.
[4348.76 → 4371.24] Thank you.
