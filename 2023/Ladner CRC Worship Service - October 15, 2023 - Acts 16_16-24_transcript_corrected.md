[293.96 → 295.96] Wow.
[295.96 → 296.96] Nice finish this morning.
[296.96 → 297.96] Thanks, Paul.
[297.96 → 299.96] Good morning, everyone.
[299.96 → 301.96] Nice to see you all here.
[301.96 → 305.96] It seems like every week the number of folks in the room seems to be increasing.
[305.96 → 307.96] That's lovely.
[307.96 → 310.96] And for those of you who might be visitors, welcome to you as well.
[310.96 → 312.96] If you have time afterward, we have coffee in back.
[312.96 → 316.96] We'd like to get to know you and be introduced by whoever brought you here this morning.
[316.96 → 320.96] And welcome to you as well.
[320.96 → 323.96] If you look around, it's not your eyes.
[323.96 → 325.96] The colour of the lights is different this morning.
[325.96 → 329.96] The maintenance committee has been working vigorously during the last week.
[329.96 → 333.96] We replaced all these lights with LEDs.
[333.96 → 337.96] I can only guess how high those guys were off the ground when that was happening.
[337.96 → 340.96] But it's a nice colour.
[340.96 → 341.96] And it's not your eyes.
[341.96 → 344.96] And it's not the ring of fire eclipse or anything like that.
[344.96 → 351.96] And all the better to see, by the way, the flowers here this morning.
[351.96 → 352.96] They look beautiful.
[352.96 → 359.96] I think we often don't mention that Cora and Adriana and their team are often responsible for making the front of this auditorium look beautiful.
[359.96 → 363.96] And these roses are certainly an example of that this morning.
[363.96 → 364.96] So thank you.
[364.96 → 378.96] I'm reminded that as an announcement that there is a men's breakfast that kind of re-restarts this fall.
[378.96 → 379.96] And it's this coming Saturday.
[379.96 → 384.96] It's in the bulletin for details this coming Saturday morning at 8 o'clock.
[384.96 → 388.96] I was also reminded by the bulletin that it's someone's birthday tomorrow.
[388.96 → 390.96] It's Ally Hack lander's birthday.
[390.96 → 401.96] Now, I'm not sure if I'm at liberty to say exactly how old she is, but it's somewhere between 95 and 100.
[401.96 → 406.96] So if you get a chance to welcome her this morning and wish her a happy birthday tomorrow,
[406.96 → 410.96] remind her, as I often do, that you don't look a day over 80.
[410.96 → 412.96] And that is the truth.
[412.96 → 413.96] All right.
[413.96 → 421.96] At the end of the service today, the deacons will be handing out the Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes,
[421.96 → 423.96] along with the instructions.
[423.96 → 427.96] The bulletin has quite a few details, but there will be instructions along with this flattened box.
[427.96 → 432.96] You'll have to learn how to fold a box and then go home and put things in it.
[432.96 → 434.96] And it's a very good service project.
[434.96 → 436.96] And that begins today.
[436.96 → 442.96] I think you don't have to return them until, I believe it's November 12 or something like that.
[442.96 → 448.96] Pastor Jason will continue his series today in Acts, Living God's Mission.
[448.96 → 452.96] His sermon title is Liberating Captives.
[452.96 → 454.96] Today's offering is for Bethesda.
[454.96 → 457.96] That's an organization known well to many people here.
[457.96 → 463.96] It supports individuals who have intellectual and developmental disabilities with residential care,
[463.96 → 469.96] day programs, employment services, community inclusion, summer camps, and family support.
[473.96 → 476.96] Let's begin with our call to worship.
[476.96 → 482.96] Our God is kind and gracious and loving, but in Psalm 46, verse 10,
[482.96 → 486.96] he reminds us that he is never to be taken for granted.
[486.96 → 491.96] It says there, be still and know that I am God.
[491.96 → 493.96] I will be exalted among the nations.
[493.96 → 496.96] I will be exalted in the earth.
[496.96 → 502.96] In that vein, may I lead you in an opening prayer of adoration.
[502.96 → 504.96] Please pray with me.
[504.96 → 510.96] Thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity of worship,
[510.96 → 516.96] for the freedom to be among your family, meeting together in your house and in the warmth of your embrace.
[516.96 → 524.96] Thank you that in worship we can put aside the uncertainties of this world and rest upon your certainties,
[524.96 → 526.96] for your promises are not changeable.
[526.96 → 532.96] We desire to be a church that shines the light of Jesus in everything that we do.
[532.96 → 542.96] Thank you that as we draw near in worship, we are in a place where we can be at peace in your presence, find healing and refreshment.
[542.96 → 548.96] Thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity of worship.
[548.96 → 550.96] Amen.
[550.96 → 558.96] The Lord's greeting to us comes from 1 Thessalonians 5, verses 16 to 18.
[558.96 → 562.96] Paul is actually speaking on God's behalf, and he says,
[562.96 → 571.96] Rejoice always. Pray continually. Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[571.96 → 575.96] Please stand and welcome the other folks here this morning.
[575.96 → 577.96] Thank you.
[605.96 → 606.96] Amen.
[606.96 → 618.38] You're the one who
[622.12 → 623.90] The Word of God, Under once settle,
[623.96 → 627.96] From His While the heaven them from God is rich,
[627.96 → 628.96] Amen.
[657.96 → 658.96] Amen.
[687.96 → 689.96] Amen.
[717.96 → 719.96] Amen.
[747.96 → 749.96] Yeah.
[749.96 → 750.96] Yeah.
[760.96 → 775.96] Now we have a song with a very familiar tune
[775.96 → 779.70] familiar tune, but probably brand-new words for everyone.
[779.86 → 782.28] Rejoice, you righteous in the Lord.
[792.28 → 796.84] Rejoice, you righteous in the Lord.
[797.08 → 801.28] In song, your voice is raised.
[801.28 → 806.18] A wakeless, hulking in the heart.
[806.58 → 810.68] Lift God's name in praise.
[811.22 → 815.66] For my God's word, the heavens were on.
[816.00 → 819.46] God laid the seed alive.
[820.64 → 825.12] And on a fizz and firmament,
[825.44 → 828.56] I made at God's command.
[828.56 → 835.16] Let every nation, every land,
[835.52 → 839.46] Unite with all our power.
[840.00 → 843.60] And humbly lay their heart,
[843.70 → 848.46] We'll praise him, army for the Lord.
[848.46 → 854.08] How happy are God's faithful ones,
[854.42 → 858.48] How blessed God's chosen days.
[859.02 → 863.44] For surely and in their rivers,
[863.80 → 868.52] Our glory shall be best.
[868.52 → 874.14] Behold God's ever watchful heart,
[874.48 → 878.14] Sees through our dark despair.
[879.40 → 884.16] The hearts of grace and soul of us,
[884.42 → 888.48] With strong and tender care.
[888.48 → 892.44] The hope of all our hearts,
[892.44 → 894.22] The hope of all our hearts,
[894.44 → 896.44] The hope of all our hearts,
[896.44 → 898.44] The hope of all our hearts,
[898.44 → 899.44] The hope of all our hearts,
[899.44 → 904.14] God's mercy and God's steadfast love,
[904.14 → 910.32] Shall follow our hearts.
[910.32 → 911.40] Amen.
[916.28 → 918.70] O praise the name of the Lord our God,
[918.74 → 920.14] O praise his name forever.
[920.72 → 923.52] For endless days, we will sing your praise,
[923.52 → 925.58] O God, our God.
[925.58 → 944.54] I cast my heart to Calvary,
[944.54 → 951.10] Where Jesus bled and died for me,
[951.10 → 957.62] I see his voice, his hands, his feet,
[957.62 → 963.48] My Saviour on that cursed tree.
[966.24 → 972.98] He's brought him up and dressed in tears,
[972.98 → 978.58] They lay him down in Joseph's tomb,
[978.58 → 985.10] The entrance sealed by heavy stone,
[985.10 → 991.10] Messiah's tomb and all our Lord.
[991.10 → 1000.10] O praise the name of the Lord our God,
[1000.10 → 1006.10] O praise his name forevermore,
[1006.10 → 1012.62] For endless days, we will sing your praise,
[1012.62 → 1018.62] O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1018.62 → 1024.90] For endless days, moved on earth,
[1024.90 → 1025.14] It's a glacial songs дом,
[1025.14 → 1026.78] For earth as our Lord will never give.
[1026.78 → 1029.14] See him for David,
[1029.14 → 1031.70] The sorrow of the hope of all our hearts,
[1031.70 → 1033.16] Your sins, their son of heaven,
[1033.16 → 1036.08] Death as crucified,
[1036.08 → 1038.28] As the equalization of riches,
[1038.28 → 1039.90] う ifミних of city,
[1039.90 → 1041.74] The lack of a great time calling,
[1041.74 → 1043.86] then riches he'll fly.
[1043.86 → 1045.14] And he will sing your census more,
[1045.14 → 1053.98] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[1053.98 → 1056.90] O praise His name
[1056.90 → 1062.50] Forevermore, for endless days
[1062.50 → 1065.90] We will sing our praises
[1065.90 → 1071.34] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1071.34 → 1079.82] We shall return in robes of wine
[1079.82 → 1085.92] The praising sun shall be spent night
[1085.92 → 1091.86] And I will rise among blessings
[1091.86 → 1098.62] My guest runs straight from Jesus' face
[1098.62 → 1107.10] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[1107.10 → 1110.52] O praise His name
[1110.52 → 1116.10] Forevermore, for endless days
[1116.10 → 1119.26] We will sing our praises
[1119.26 → 1124.74] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1124.74 → 1130.74] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1130.74 → 1137.74] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1137.74 → 1152.22] O Lord our God
[1152.22 → 1160.14] Many of you are somewhere between 10 and 20 years, plus or minus my age, and that means, uh, never mind.
[1160.14 → 1166.62] But that means when you were young, and you were a member of this church or another Christian reformed church
[1166.62 → 1174.62] Very likely about 10 minutes into the message each morning was the Ten Commandments
[1174.62 → 1179.62] And it was read every Sunday without fail
[1179.62 → 1185.50] And many of us could probably recite it still without much urging and keep up with it
[1185.50 → 1189.04] It's not unique to the church in North America
[1189.04 → 1193.98] Some years ago Elaine and I and Lindsay were living in Groningen
[1193.98 → 1194.98] I think I said that right
[1194.98 → 1197.40] For about three or four months
[1197.40 → 1202.90] And we went to a Dutch Christian reformed church there
[1202.90 → 1204.62] I'm going to try to say it
[1204.62 → 1206.98] Maybe I won't
[1206.98 → 1212.46] How close was that?
[1214.14 → 1216.32] Anyway, it took a couple trains to get there
[1216.32 → 1218.12] And there were wonderful people when we were there
[1218.12 → 1220.60] But we didn't get much out of the service
[1220.60 → 1222.76] Because it was all in Dutch
[1222.76 → 1224.64] And who knew?
[1226.06 → 1228.02] But at 9.40 in the morning
[1228.02 → 1230.24] There was a certain cadence that started
[1230.24 → 1232.20] And you knew that they were reading the law
[1232.20 → 1234.10] Just as we would read it here
[1234.10 → 1237.70] Now I'm not suggesting we go back to reading the Ten Commandments every Sunday
[1237.70 → 1239.76] Or even officially this morning
[1239.76 → 1244.36] But I think it deserves mentioning periodically that we have the Ten Commandments
[1244.36 → 1246.76] It was a law to the original Israelites
[1246.76 → 1248.54] But it applies equally well to us
[1248.54 → 1251.20] It does need some cultural upgrading
[1251.20 → 1254.92] If my neighbour has an ass or an ox
[1254.92 → 1256.40] I don't care
[1256.40 → 1258.38] I don't want it
[1258.38 → 1262.32] But so what we're going to do this morning
[1262.32 → 1265.84] Is I'm going to ask you to read the basic Ten Commandments one at a time
[1265.84 → 1270.22] And then I'll try to add some words that make it relevant to our lives today
[1270.22 → 1274.78] Read with me
[1274.78 → 1278.56] You shall have no other gods before me
[1278.56 → 1283.48] Do not worship any other god than the one true god
[1283.48 → 1285.64] All others are false gods
[1285.64 → 1287.78] Worship this true god alone
[1287.78 → 1289.00] That hasn't changed
[1289.00 → 1293.42] You shall not make for yourselves an idol
[1293.42 → 1297.44] Do not make idols or images in the form of God
[1297.44 → 1298.66] But further
[1298.66 → 1302.94] An idol can also be anything or anyone you worship
[1302.94 → 1305.30] By making it more important than God
[1305.30 → 1309.70] If something has your time, attention, and affections
[1309.70 → 1311.72] It could be an idol in your life
[1311.72 → 1313.60] Work can become an idol
[1313.60 → 1315.80] So can material goods
[1315.80 → 1320.40] Do not allow music, computers, or similar activities
[1320.40 → 1322.88] To be more important in your life than God
[1322.88 → 1330.00] You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God
[1330.00 → 1333.26] Do not treat God's name with disrespect
[1333.26 → 1335.06] Because of God's importance
[1335.06 → 1338.00] His name is to be spoken of reverently and with honour
[1338.00 → 1340.18] Do not use God's name lightly
[1340.18 → 1341.80] Or as a swear word
[1341.80 → 1344.72] How many times in text have we seen OMG?
[1344.72 → 1347.90] Honour God with your words
[1347.90 → 1350.70] When we don't, we diminish ourselves
[1350.70 → 1352.30] And we diminish God
[1352.30 → 1354.32] In whose image we are created
[1354.32 → 1360.14] Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy
[1360.14 → 1364.84] Dedicate or set aside a regular day each week
[1364.84 → 1366.90] For rest and worship of the Lord
[1366.90 → 1368.56] And to be with his family
[1368.56 → 1371.56] We need time to be without the distractions
[1371.56 → 1375.10] And interruptions that are so prevalent in modern life
[1375.10 → 1379.76] Honour your father and your mother
[1379.76 → 1383.30] Love and respect your parents at all times
[1383.30 → 1385.42] Even when you disagree with them
[1385.42 → 1389.34] You shall not murder
[1389.34 → 1394.56] Yes, do not deliberately kill a fellow human being
[1394.56 → 1397.48] Further, or even think about killing someone
[1397.48 → 1400.42] But even further, don't hate people
[1400.42 → 1402.68] Or hurt them with words and actions
[1402.68 → 1407.26] You shall not commit adultery
[1407.26 → 1411.50] Do not have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse
[1411.50 → 1414.22] God forbids sex outside the bounds of marriage
[1414.22 → 1419.10] Even further, respect your body and other people's bodies
[1419.10 → 1423.22] You shall not steal
[1423.22 → 1425.08] Yes, do not steal
[1425.08 → 1428.60] Further, respect the property of other people
[1428.60 → 1432.22] And do not take anything that belongs to someone else without permission
[1432.22 → 1436.90] You shall not give false testimony
[1436.90 → 1439.84] Do not tell a lie about someone
[1439.84 → 1442.56] Or bring false accusation against another person
[1442.56 → 1446.80] But further, strive to tell the truth at all times
[1446.80 → 1450.68] Sometimes it seems like truth is under siege today
[1450.68 → 1454.64] The phrase alternate facts or fake news comes to mind
[1454.64 → 1458.58] There are times when facts are not entirely clear
[1458.58 → 1461.32] But often the truth can be determined
[1461.32 → 1465.58] This commandment reminds us that truth is still a sacred value
[1465.58 → 1472.18] You shall not covet anything that is your neighbour's
[1472.18 → 1477.92] Do not spend time wishing that you had what belongs to someone else
[1477.92 → 1481.76] Comparing yourself to others and longing to have what they have
[1481.76 → 1486.20] Can lead to jealousy, envy, and other sins
[1486.20 → 1488.50] Be content with what you have
[1488.50 → 1491.26] And with the talents and skills God has given you
[1491.26 → 1496.18] In today's world, the best antidote to envy is gratitude
[1496.18 → 1499.92] Understanding that everything is a gift from God
[1499.92 → 1505.42] In thinking of the summary of the law that Jesus gave us
[1505.42 → 1509.00] We must admit that at many times we have not loved the Lord our God
[1509.00 → 1512.44] With all our hearts, our souls, and with all our minds
[1512.44 → 1516.30] And we have not always loved our neighbour as ourselves
[1516.30 → 1522.16] We admit that, but we have words of assurance from our God
[1522.16 → 1524.92] And I'm quoting from Colossians 2
[1524.92 → 1528.94] Brothers and sisters, hear the good news
[1528.94 → 1530.72] God has forgiven your sins
[1530.72 → 1535.94] Christ has utterly wiped out the damning evidence that hangs over our heads
[1535.94 → 1541.30] And has rendered it powerless by nailing it over his own head on the cross
[1541.30 → 1543.68] In Christ we have a new life
[1543.68 → 1546.00] A chance to begin again
[1546.00 → 1547.54] Thanks be to God
[1547.54 → 1551.68] We'll sing a song of response, Goodness of God
[1551.68 → 1555.48] After that, the children ages 3 to grade 5
[1555.48 → 1558.74] Are welcome to go to the Kids Life Children's Worship
[1558.74 → 1578.18] I love you, Lord
[1578.18 → 1583.54] For your mercy never fails me
[1583.54 → 1590.92] All my days I've been held in your hands
[1590.92 → 1595.24] From the moment that I wake up
[1595.24 → 1598.92] Until I lay my head
[1598.92 → 1605.18] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1605.18 → 1610.28] Oh my Lord
[1610.28 → 1612.62] Oh my Lord, you have been faithful
[1612.62 → 1621.56] Oh my Lord, you have been so, so good
[1621.56 → 1626.76] With every breath that I am in
[1626.76 → 1634.20] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1634.20 → 1642.22] I love your voice
[1642.22 → 1646.58] You have led me through the fire
[1646.58 → 1650.14] In darkness and eyes
[1650.14 → 1653.66] You are lost like no other
[1653.66 → 1654.98] I've known God
[1654.98 → 1657.88] I've known you as a father
[1657.88 → 1662.40] I've known you as a friend
[1662.40 → 1670.92] I have lived in the goodness of God
[1670.92 → 1675.56] Oh my Lord, you have been faithful.
[1678.14 → 1684.08] Oh my Lord, you have been so, so good.
[1685.68 → 1696.48] With every breath that I am thankful, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1696.48 → 1703.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1703.48 → 1709.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1709.48 → 1717.48] With my heart, I'm surrender now, I give you everything.
[1717.48 → 1724.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1724.48 → 1726.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1726.48 → 1731.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1731.48 → 1738.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1738.48 → 1747.48] With my life laid down, I'm surrender now, I give you everything.
[1747.48 → 1754.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1754.48 → 1761.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1761.48 → 1766.48] Oh my Lord, you have been faithful.
[1766.48 → 1773.48] Oh my Lord, you have been so, so good.
[1773.48 → 1775.48] So good.
[1775.48 → 1777.48] Oh my Lord, you have been so, so good.
[1777.48 → 1788.48] With every breath that I am thankful, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1788.48 → 1795.48] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1795.48 → 1820.48] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1820.48 → 1824.48] I heard an antidote recently from another pastor.
[1824.48 → 1829.48] He said that in his church, some people had come in that they were new, they were guests.
[1829.48 → 1831.48] And so after the service, he got to talking to them.
[1831.48 → 1834.48] And it turns out they were celebrating their anniversary.
[1834.48 → 1837.48] He said, oh, well, you come to church on your anniversary.
[1837.48 → 1842.48] And he said, yes, well, you know, the was it the fourth commandment?
[1842.48 → 1846.48] It's before the seventh to honour the marriage vows.
[1846.48 → 1850.48] So it's quite impressive, right?
[1850.48 → 1852.48] Well, good morning.
[1852.48 → 1853.48] Thank you.
[1853.48 → 1856.48] So we have been studying Acts over the last few months.
[1856.48 → 1860.48] And so please, would you open your Bibles to Acts chapter 16.
[1860.48 → 1867.48] It is on page 825 in your pew Bible, 825, Acts 16.
[1867.48 → 1873.48] So as you're turning there, let me kind of catch us up and give us a little review.
[1873.48 → 1875.48] So Paul and his companions, right?
[1875.48 → 1880.48] So right now we have Paul, Silas, Timothy, and now Luke has joined them.
[1880.48 → 1883.48] And they're on their second missionary journey.
[1883.48 → 1886.48] God had given Paul a vision of a man from Macedonia.
[1886.48 → 1892.48] And this man was calling them in the vision to come and help them to come and preach the gospel there.
[1892.48 → 1897.48] And so Paul and his companions, they arrive in Philippi, this Roman colony.
[1897.48 → 1906.48] And in Acts 16, Luke, who is the author of Acts, gives us a series of three conversion stories.
[1906.48 → 1912.48] We have the conversions of Lydia, the slave girl, then the Philippian jailer.
[1912.48 → 1916.48] And so the first convert we looked at last time was Lydia.
[1916.48 → 1920.48] And the story of Lydia is really quite wonderful.
[1920.48 → 1926.48] She is a worshipper of the God of Israel, even though she is Greek.
[1926.48 → 1933.48] And when Paul meets her, she gladly opens her heart to the gospel.
[1933.48 → 1944.48] And then as a response to that, she opens her home to Paul and his companions because they have become family in Christ.
[1944.48 → 1953.48] Now today, the story continues, and the story that follows could hardly be more different.
[1953.48 → 1955.48] It is a dark story.
[1955.48 → 1961.48] It's full of slavery, exploitation, and evil spirits.
[1961.48 → 1965.48] And actually, it ends in violence and imprisonment.
[1965.48 → 1973.48] And yet, even here, yet even here, we see the light of the gospel break in and set this girl free.
[1973.48 → 1976.48] And she too becomes part of the family of God.
[1976.48 → 1979.48] And so let's read our passage this morning.
[1979.48 → 1982.48] Please join me as I read for us, Acts 14.
[1982.48 → 1987.48] If you have it in front of you in your Bibles, we'll also follow along on the screen.
[1987.48 → 1991.48] And so here's the word of the Lord.
[1991.48 → 2001.48] Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
[2001.48 → 2006.48] She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
[2006.48 → 2010.48] She followed Paul and the rest of us shouting,
[2010.48 → 2016.48] These men are servants of the Most High God who are telling you the way to be saved.
[2016.48 → 2019.48] She kept this up for many days.
[2019.48 → 2025.48] Finally, Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit,
[2025.48 → 2029.48] In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her.
[2029.48 → 2032.48] At that moment, the spirit left her.
[2032.48 → 2037.48] When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone,
[2037.48 → 2042.48] they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
[2042.48 → 2045.48] They brought them before the magistrates and said,
[2045.48 → 2057.48] These men are Jews and are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.
[2057.48 → 2061.48] The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas.
[2061.48 → 2067.48] And the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
[2067.48 → 2072.48] After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison.
[2072.48 → 2076.48] And the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
[2076.48 → 2085.48] When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
[2085.48 → 2087.48] This is the word of the Lord.
[2087.48 → 2088.48] Amen.
[2088.48 → 2089.48] Let's pray.
[2089.48 → 2098.48] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word, that it is true and that you give it to us because you love us.
[2098.48 → 2106.48] And we ask that by your Holy Spirit this morning, Lord, that you would open our eyes, that you would open our hearts,
[2106.48 → 2114.48] that we might know you more, that we might walk in your ways, and all to the glory of your name.
[2114.48 → 2117.48] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[2117.48 → 2126.48] So I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Chronicles of Narnia story by C.S. Lewis.
[2126.48 → 2133.48] So in the story, there is a wicked queen, and she lives in a castle in the land of Narnia.
[2133.48 → 2140.48] And she has turned the whole land into cold, bitter winter.
[2140.48 → 2149.48] And whenever an animal of the forest wanders too close to the castle, she turns them into a statue, a stone statue.
[2149.48 → 2163.48] But towards the end of this part of the story, Aslan the lion and two girls, Lucy and Susan, they go to the castle, and they begin to set these animals free, whom the witch had turned into stone.
[2163.48 → 2167.48] So I want to read for you a short passage from the book.
[2167.48 → 2169.48] Here it is.
[2169.48 → 2173.48] What an extraordinary place, cried Lucy.
[2173.48 → 2177.48] All those stone animals and people too.
[2177.48 → 2180.48] It's, it's a museum.
[2180.48 → 2184.48] Hush, said Susan.
[2184.48 → 2185.48] Aslan's doing something.
[2185.48 → 2187.48] He was indeed.
[2187.48 → 2192.48] He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him.
[2192.48 → 2198.48] Then without waiting a moment, he whisked around to deal with a stone rabbit on his right.
[2198.48 → 2201.48] And he rushed on to two senators.
[2201.48 → 2208.48] But at that moment, Lucy said, Oh, Susan, look, look at the lion.
[2208.48 → 2214.48] For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him, the stone lion looked just the same.
[2214.48 → 2222.48] But then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back.
[2222.48 → 2224.48] Then the colour spread.
[2224.48 → 2233.48] The lion shook his mane and all the heavy stone folds rippled into living hair.
[2233.48 → 2239.48] Then he opened a great red mouth warm and living and gave a prodigious yawn.
[2239.48 → 2242.48] And now his hind legs had come to life.
[2242.48 → 2247.48] Then having caught sight of Aslan, he went bounding after him.
[2247.48 → 2251.48] Of course, the children's eyes turned to follow the lion.
[2251.48 → 2256.48] But the sight they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him.
[2256.48 → 2260.48] Everywhere, the statues were coming to life.
[2260.48 → 2264.48] The courtyard looked no longer like a museum.
[2264.48 → 2266.48] It looked more like a zoo.
[2266.48 → 2271.48] Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing around him
[2271.48 → 2274.48] till he was almost hidden in the crowd.
[2274.48 → 2278.48] I think it's such a beautiful scene in this story.
[2278.48 → 2284.48] All of these animals who were once stone coming to life at the breath or the touch of Aslan.
[2284.48 → 2286.48] And then following him.
[2286.48 → 2291.48] And the reason I want to share this with you is that there's a striking similarity
[2291.48 → 2296.48] between that story and then what is happening in our passage this morning.
[2296.48 → 2300.48] In Narnia, the wicked queen has bound these animals in stone.
[2300.48 → 2303.48] And Aslan, the lion, he sets them free.
[2303.48 → 2309.48] And in our passage, Satan has bound a young girl in slavery to an evil spirit.
[2309.48 → 2315.48] And we see the spirit of Jesus set her free as well.
[2315.48 → 2322.48] And so this morning, what I'd like to do is look carefully at this passage that Luke has narrated for us.
[2322.48 → 2328.48] And then we'll talk about how we can join this work of God of setting captives free.
[2328.48 → 2332.48] Okay, so let's jump into this passage and look at it carefully.
[2332.48 → 2335.48] And let's begin at verse 14.
[2335.48 → 2336.48] Sorry, 16.
[2336.48 → 2338.48] Verse 16, that's where we are.
[2338.48 → 2340.48] And here's what it says.
[2340.48 → 2343.48] Once when we were going to the place of prayer.
[2343.48 → 2345.48] Keep that in your mind.
[2345.48 → 2347.48] Okay, we're going to come back to that later.
[2347.48 → 2349.48] They were going to the place of prayer.
[2349.48 → 2355.48] We were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
[2355.48 → 2360.48] She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
[2360.48 → 2362.48] Okay, so Paul, they're Paul and his companions.
[2362.48 → 2364.48] They're going to the way of prayer.
[2364.48 → 2368.48] But on their way, they are met by a slave girl.
[2368.48 → 2371.48] And Luke tells us two things about her.
[2371.48 → 2377.48] First, is that she had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
[2377.48 → 2380.48] In other words, she had a demonic spirit.
[2380.48 → 2382.48] A spirit of divination.
[2382.48 → 2388.48] Or literally, in the original language, she had a spirit of python.
[2388.48 → 2397.48] Now, a python in English is a word for a large snake that squeezes the life out of its victims.
[2397.48 → 2400.48] And that is precisely what this word means.
[2400.48 → 2408.48] In the Greek mythology of the ancient world, there was a python that actually guarded the entrance to the Oracle of Delphi,
[2408.48 → 2411.48] which was just south of where they were in Greece.
[2411.48 → 2420.48] And it was said that as part of this mythology, that anyone who had the spirit of the snake could predict the future.
[2420.48 → 2422.48] They could fortune tell or be an Oracle.
[2422.48 → 2432.48] And so this spirit enables her, this girl, to understand what may be supernatural facts about people's lives.
[2432.48 → 2435.48] That's the first thing we know about her.
[2435.48 → 2446.48] The second thing we know is that she made her slave owners a great deal of money from exploiting her abilities.
[2446.48 → 2449.48] And this must, you know, we have to have compassion on this girl.
[2449.48 → 2453.48] This must have been very difficult for her.
[2453.48 → 2454.48] Right?
[2454.48 → 2466.48] In a sense, it is a form of prostitution.
[2466.48 → 2470.48] And so socially, she belongs to her slave master.
[2470.48 → 2473.48] Spiritually, she belongs to this demonic spirit.
[2473.48 → 2477.48] And so she was in this kind of double bondage.
[2477.48 → 2483.48] In fact, I wouldn't be too dissimilar to somebody in bondage to drug addiction today.
[2483.48 → 2486.48] In that, you know, they are caught in this addiction.
[2486.48 → 2493.48] It's often not so, not only that they are addicted to the substance, but also they are at the mercy of the drug dealer.
[2493.48 → 2494.48] Right?
[2494.48 → 2499.48] Who preys upon the misery and the wretchedness of that person as well.
[2499.48 → 2502.48] So that is the situation of this girl.
[2502.48 → 2507.48] She is in bondage to this evil spirit and to her owners.
[2507.48 → 2511.48] Now, let's notice what happens in verse 17.
[2511.48 → 2517.48] As Paul and his friends continue on the way, the girl follows them.
[2517.48 → 2521.48] And this is what she yells out.
[2521.48 → 2528.48] These men are servants of the Most High God who are telling you the way to be saved.
[2528.48 → 2535.48] Now, I mean, I don't know about you, but when you read that, don't you find that a bit perplexing?
[2535.48 → 2536.48] Right?
[2536.48 → 2539.48] Because what she says is true.
[2539.48 → 2540.48] Right?
[2540.48 → 2544.48] And so in a sense, this demon possessed girl is helping them evangelize.
[2544.48 → 2545.48] Right?
[2545.48 → 2548.48] She's proclaiming the gospel to everybody.
[2548.48 → 2557.48] It's similar to how sometimes in Jesus' own ministry, demon possessed people would cry out and announce who he is.
[2557.48 → 2558.48] Right?
[2558.48 → 2562.48] We know who you are, the Holy One of God.
[2562.48 → 2568.48] And so in a sense, there's nothing formally wrong with what she is saying.
[2568.48 → 2577.48] But the question we should ask is why would she say these things that are actually true?
[2577.48 → 2581.48] And I think likely the reason is deception.
[2581.48 → 2582.48] Right?
[2582.48 → 2592.48] Some have conjectured that Satan will say 100 things that are true to get you to believe the 101st thing that is false.
[2592.48 → 2598.48] You know, establishing this initial credibility is important for a snake.
[2598.48 → 2599.48] Right?
[2599.48 → 2602.48] Just think back to the Garden of Eden.
[2602.48 → 2609.48] You know what a great advantage she would have if she could get Paul and his people to trust her.
[2609.48 → 2615.48] Well, in verse 18, the passage says, she kept this up for many days.
[2615.48 → 2619.48] So initially, Paul seems to kind of ignore her.
[2619.48 → 2624.48] Like he doesn't want to do anything about this situation yet.
[2624.48 → 2625.48] Why?
[2625.48 → 2626.48] Right?
[2626.48 → 2630.48] Why didn't Paul stop immediately and just cast this demon out of her?
[2630.48 → 2631.48] Right?
[2631.48 → 2633.48] Why did he put up with this for so long?
[2633.48 → 2636.48] Well, we don't know for sure because Luke doesn't tell us.
[2636.48 → 2646.48] But I think a likely reason is that he didn't want to draw attention to her, and he didn't want to cause a scene.
[2646.48 → 2654.48] Because if we remember what happened back in chapter 14, when Paul and Barnabas went to Lustra, Paul healed a man who was lame.
[2654.48 → 2656.48] And what happened?
[2656.48 → 2659.48] The people of the town wanted to worship Paul.
[2659.48 → 2661.48] They worshipped him as a god.
[2661.48 → 2666.48] And because of this great disruption, the Jews in the city stoned him nearly to death.
[2666.48 → 2671.48] So he maybe thought, I don't want this to happen again.
[2671.48 → 2675.48] I still need time to preach the gospel in the city of Philippi.
[2675.48 → 2678.48] And if I do anything now, it might cause trouble.
[2678.48 → 2680.48] It might disrupt things.
[2680.48 → 2682.48] And we don't want that.
[2682.48 → 2687.48] You know, and of course, that's exactly what happens as we see in the passage.
[2687.48 → 2694.48] But as time went on, days go by, this woman did not leave them alone.
[2694.48 → 2707.48] And it seems like it became more and more possible that people would start to think maybe there was a kind of association between Paul as a gospel preacher and this demon-possessed woman.
[2707.48 → 2709.48] Maybe people would start to think they're in partnership.
[2709.48 → 2715.48] It seemed that Paul eventually realized that this is actually harming the gospel witness.
[2715.48 → 2719.48] So verse 18 says this.
[2719.48 → 2725.48] Finally, Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit,
[2725.48 → 2728.48] In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her.
[2728.48 → 2731.48] At that moment, the spirit left her.
[2731.48 → 2738.48] Now, the text says that Paul was annoyed at the girl.
[2738.48 → 2741.48] And so we might, could understand why, right?
[2741.48 → 2743.48] Can you imagine this going on for days?
[2743.48 → 2753.48] This girl following you around, screaming all the time while you're trying to share the faith, while you're trying to talk to people, spend time with people.
[2753.48 → 2758.48] Kind of makes me think of being on a family car trip.
[2758.48 → 2766.48] The kids are fighting in the back and eventually the dad might just get so fed up that he pulls over the car and cast the kids out of the car to the side of the road.
[2766.48 → 2769.48] I don't know why I thought of this.
[2769.48 → 2773.48] But maybe it's something like that.
[2773.48 → 2777.48] And maybe that's why the translators here say he was annoyed.
[2777.48 → 2779.48] She kept this up for many days.
[2779.48 → 2781.48] Finally, Paul became annoyed.
[2781.48 → 2786.48] But actually, the word that's translated annoyed could also be translated another way.
[2786.48 → 2789.48] It could be translated as grieved.
[2789.48 → 2797.48] And I think in the context of what's going on here, perhaps that makes a little bit more sense to understand it that way.
[2797.48 → 2800.48] That he was grieved.
[2800.48 → 2806.48] He was indignant because of the misery that this girl was in.
[2806.48 → 2817.48] So I think at a certain point, he thought, even if I get kicked out of Philippi, even if I get stoned again, this girl needs to be rescued.
[2817.48 → 2822.48] And so in his distress, it leads him to liberate this girl.
[2822.48 → 2827.48] And so he says, in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her.
[2827.48 → 2828.48] And it does.
[2828.48 → 2832.48] Because spirits come out at the name of Jesus Christ.
[2832.48 → 2833.48] Right?
[2833.48 → 2836.48] Because Jesus is over the spirit world.
[2836.48 → 2841.48] And what's interesting, I think, is that Paul does not speak to the girl, does he?
[2841.48 → 2844.48] He speaks to the spirit because the girl is not the problem.
[2844.48 → 2848.48] The spirit is the problem.
[2848.48 → 2857.48] Now, before moving on to see what happens next to Paul and Silas, we might wonder, well, what happened to this girl?
[2857.48 → 2861.48] And the thing is, Luke doesn't tell us what happens to her.
[2861.48 → 2863.48] She doesn't tell us anything more about her.
[2863.48 → 2868.48] He doesn't explicitly refer to her conversion or her baptism.
[2868.48 → 2877.48] But I think there is good reason to believe that she became a follower of Jesus and became a member of the church in Philippi.
[2877.48 → 2882.48] And I think this is important to actually just take a moment to think about this.
[2882.48 → 2888.48] So I believe that she became converted for two reasons.
[2888.48 → 2899.48] Okay, so first, in the Gospels, wherever Jesus performed an exorcism, it was always effectual.
[2899.48 → 2906.48] So what does it mean for Jesus to cast out a demon of a person when we see this happening in his ministry?
[2906.48 → 2909.48] It means that a war is taking place.
[2909.48 → 2910.48] Right?
[2910.48 → 2912.48] A holy war is taking place.
[2912.48 → 2920.48] There's a war brought on by Satan and his demons where they enter into one made in the image of God, and they take them over.
[2920.48 → 2927.48] And then there is the Lord Jesus Christ who goes to battle against the strong man, against Satan.
[2927.48 → 2933.48] And when Jesus goes to battle with the strong man, he casts out the demon by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2933.48 → 2938.48] So look with me at Matthew chapter 12, verse 28.
[2938.48 → 2939.48] Jesus is speaking.
[2939.48 → 2946.48] He says, but if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[2946.48 → 2947.48] Right?
[2947.48 → 2949.48] He says it's a clash of kingdoms.
[2949.48 → 2955.48] And that's how demons are cast out and defeated by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2955.48 → 2966.48] So when this slave girl has a demon and is cast out, it is by this same power that Paul has, as a minister of Jesus Christ, that he casts out this demon.
[2966.48 → 2976.48] And so when the Holy Spirit comes to this girl and defeats the demon, it is highly unlikely that the Spirit would then leave her.
[2976.48 → 2989.48] And that is why in Mark chapter 5, after Christ casts these demons out of a man, he says to the man, go and tell everyone how much mercy God has had on you.
[2989.48 → 2993.48] And so that's the first reason I think this girl was saved.
[2993.48 → 2999.48] Because the Holy Spirit came into her and drove out this demon.
[2999.48 → 3001.48] And I don't think the Spirit is going to leave her.
[3001.48 → 3010.48] Second, I think probably even more convincingly than anything, is that Luke is really giving us a narrative of three conversion stories.
[3010.48 → 3017.48] So Lydia, a righteous woman who simply believes her heart is opened at the preaching of Paul.
[3017.48 → 3022.48] And then the slave girl who had a demon, then we'll see next week, the Philippian jailer.
[3022.48 → 3027.48] So you have a narrative of conversions taking place here in Acts 16.
[3027.48 → 3034.48] So I think we are to understand that Paul then begins to teach this girl about Jesus.
[3034.48 → 3041.48] And that she becomes the second member of the church in Philippi that we know of, right after Lydia.
[3041.48 → 3049.48] Okay, so now, this is all well and good, except for the fact that this girl had owners.
[3049.48 → 3057.48] And she was able to make them a lot of money as a result of this fortune-telling that she was doing.
[3057.48 → 3059.48] So let's see what happens next.
[3059.48 → 3060.48] Verse 19.
[3060.48 → 3070.48] When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, drag them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
[3070.48 → 3077.48] Now Luke is doing something fascinating here, because he uses the same verb in verse 18 and in verse 19.
[3077.48 → 3081.48] In verse 18, it says, the spirit left her.
[3081.48 → 3085.48] And then in verse 19, their money left them.
[3085.48 → 3089.48] And so this is basically kind of what's, you can't really see it in English, but that's what Paul is doing.
[3089.48 → 3091.48] It's the same verb, to exercise.
[3091.48 → 3095.48] So he's saying, the spirit left her, their money left them.
[3095.48 → 3096.48] That's what's happening.
[3096.48 → 3101.48] And now we would think that this is a moment of rejoicing, right?
[3101.48 → 3104.48] This girl has been set free.
[3104.48 → 3110.48] This is a picture of the kingdom of God breaking in and restoring this young woman.
[3110.48 → 3118.48] But what we see here is that the breaking in of the kingdom of God does not result in rejoicing for everybody.
[3118.48 → 3119.48] Right?
[3119.48 → 3126.48] And this reveals the wicked hearts of these owners.
[3126.48 → 3133.48] So they violently seize Paul and Silas and drag them into the marketplace before the rulers.
[3133.48 → 3140.48] And then they make up this whole host of charges against them without a fair trial.
[3140.48 → 3156.48] Now, so verse 20 says, these men, this is the charge, these men are Jews and are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.
[3156.48 → 3163.48] Now, Paul didn't actually do anything wrong or illegal, did he?
[3163.48 → 3170.48] So the owners that were so angry about their loss of income that they need to charge him with something.
[3170.48 → 3173.48] So they make it an issue of xenophobia.
[3173.48 → 3174.48] They're foreigners.
[3174.48 → 3175.48] They're not like us.
[3175.48 → 3176.48] They're not like us.
[3176.48 → 3182.48] And they're causing an uproar, upsetting the carefully guarded Pax Romana.
[3182.48 → 3185.48] This is a serious charge.
[3185.48 → 3188.48] Now, Paul is actually a Roman citizen.
[3188.48 → 3191.48] So these are spurious charges in many respects.
[3191.48 → 3197.48] But in this charge against him, the crowd joins in and they attack him.
[3197.48 → 3200.48] The magistrates order them to be stripped.
[3200.48 → 3201.48] They're beaten.
[3201.48 → 3204.48] They're thrown in prison, and they're put in shackles.
[3204.48 → 3215.48] And Paul later on, writing to the Thessalonians, in Thessalonians chapter 2, he talks about how they were shamefully treated in Philippi.
[3215.48 → 3219.48] And all because they preached the gospel.
[3219.48 → 3226.48] All because they set this girl free of her bondage.
[3226.48 → 3229.48] So that's the conversion of this slave girl.
[3229.48 → 3231.48] The second conversion we see.
[3231.48 → 3234.48] Next week we'll look at the third story of the Philippian jailer.
[3234.48 → 3240.48] Now, I just want to take a look at one point of application this morning.
[3240.48 → 3244.48] And what this might mean for us today.
[3244.48 → 3249.48] So let's first consider what happens to these two women.
[3249.48 → 3252.48] To Lydia and to the slave girl.
[3252.48 → 3253.48] Right?
[3253.48 → 3255.48] When Lydia's heart is open to the gospel.
[3255.48 → 3257.48] When the slave girl is set free from her bondage.
[3257.48 → 3259.48] How does this happen?
[3259.48 → 3261.48] Well, how does this happen?
[3261.48 → 3264.48] And on the one hand, we can say, well, God did it.
[3264.48 → 3265.48] Right?
[3265.48 → 3266.48] God did it.
[3266.48 → 3268.48] And of course, that's the right answer.
[3268.48 → 3269.48] God did it.
[3269.48 → 3272.48] First and foremost, this is a work of God.
[3272.48 → 3275.48] This is God fulfilling what he said he would do.
[3275.48 → 3278.48] Opening the hearts of people to believe.
[3278.48 → 3280.48] Setting the captive free.
[3280.48 → 3285.48] But notice, he doesn't do it apart from us.
[3285.48 → 3287.48] He doesn't do it apart from us.
[3287.48 → 3293.48] And so in the first place, we see when it comes to Lydia, yes, God opened her heart.
[3293.48 → 3296.48] But how did he do it?
[3296.48 → 3302.48] He did it in the midst of Paul sharing the gospel with her.
[3302.48 → 3306.48] Just like you and I do when we talk to people.
[3306.48 → 3309.48] God does the work of opening her heart.
[3309.48 → 3315.48] But the means by which God chooses to do that is actually through his people, through me and you.
[3315.48 → 3320.48] That's how the church grows as we share the gospel.
[3320.48 → 3322.48] And God uses the preaching of the gospel to open people's hearts.
[3322.48 → 3325.48] That's how the kingdom of God comes.
[3325.48 → 3330.48] But how does God use us in the case of this slave girl?
[3330.48 → 3331.48] Right?
[3331.48 → 3333.48] This is very different, isn't it?
[3333.48 → 3335.48] What does Paul do in this girl's case?
[3335.48 → 3336.48] He looks at her.
[3336.48 → 3338.48] He looks at the demon, and he says,
[3338.48 → 3341.48] In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her.
[3341.48 → 3344.48] So how are we to understand that today?
[3344.48 → 3349.48] Should we go around commanding demons and spirits to leave people?
[3349.48 → 3352.48] How are we to live this out?
[3352.48 → 3355.48] I'm glad you asked.
[3355.48 → 3366.48] Well, I think we need to be careful before we conclude that we are to just go and do likewise.
[3366.48 → 3367.48] Okay?
[3367.48 → 3372.48] The New Testament, for instance, nowhere says there is a spiritual gift of exorcism.
[3372.48 → 3376.48] And it doesn't instruct Christians to cast out demons.
[3376.48 → 3380.48] There's no command at all in the New Testament to say, go and do this.
[3381.48 → 3383.48] The passage is a historical narrative.
[3383.48 → 3386.48] It's not a guide to how to perform an exorcism.
[3386.48 → 3393.48] But that being said, it's also true that we do wrestle against unseen powers.
[3393.48 → 3394.48] Right?
[3394.48 → 3398.48] The Apostle Peter in 1 Peter 5, he says this,
[3398.48 → 3401.48] Be alert and of sober mind.
[3401.48 → 3406.48] Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
[3406.48 → 3409.48] Resist him standing firm in the faith.
[3409.48 → 3412.48] So let me suggest this.
[3412.48 → 3419.48] We do, in fact, struggle against sin, the world, and the devil.
[3420.48 → 3425.48] Most of us probably won't come across a situation where we need to cast out a demon.
[3425.48 → 3430.48] Actually, in the early church, though, there were exorcists.
[3430.48 → 3433.48] There were many, more so than deacons.
[3433.48 → 3436.48] And this was a ministry of evangelism.
[3436.48 → 3441.48] They would go around, and there were like 80 in the early church known, who were exorcists,
[3441.48 → 3445.48] who would go around casting out demons and people coming into the church.
[3445.48 → 3447.48] This ministry has somewhat faded.
[3447.48 → 3455.48] But it is very likely that we will face spiritual attacks.
[3455.48 → 3462.48] Have you ever heard or have you ever said something like this?
[3462.48 → 3465.48] Like, that person is in the grip of money.
[3465.48 → 3466.48] Right?
[3466.48 → 3475.48] That money has a power over that person in such a way that it affects or influences them in evil ways.
[3475.48 → 3478.48] Like we see in this passage with these girls' owners.
[3478.48 → 3483.48] Or we might have the sense of being enticed by something.
[3483.48 → 3489.48] Maybe you're tempted by things on the internet, and you feel irresistibly drawn towards it,
[3489.48 → 3491.48] and it has a power over you.
[3491.48 → 3496.48] So how are we to deal with that where, in so many ways in life,
[3496.48 → 3500.48] there are other forms of bondage or slavery?
[3500.48 → 3501.48] Right?
[3501.48 → 3506.48] Things that we are bound to, probably every one of us in some way.
[3506.48 → 3508.48] How are we to deal with this?
[3508.48 → 3511.48] Well, in the Gospel of Mark, in chapter 9,
[3511.48 → 3517.48] there's a story of a man bringing his mute son to the disciples
[3517.48 → 3521.48] in order for them to deliver his son from this unclean spirit.
[3521.48 → 3526.48] And as the story goes, we understand that they can't do it.
[3526.48 → 3529.48] And so the father brings this child to Jesus.
[3529.48 → 3533.48] And basically, he's like, your disciples weren't able to help him.
[3533.48 → 3536.48] And so what does Jesus do?
[3536.48 → 3537.48] He does deliver the boy.
[3537.48 → 3539.48] He drives out the unclean spirit.
[3539.48 → 3544.48] But then, when his disciples ask why they couldn't drive out the spirit,
[3544.48 → 3550.48] Jesus says, this kind can come out only by what?
[3550.48 → 3551.48] He's like, prayer.
[3551.48 → 3555.48] And so how do we actually do this?
[3555.48 → 3561.48] How can God use us to go to war against the strongholds of Satan
[3561.48 → 3565.48] in our lives, in the lives of other people, in our culture, in our world?
[3565.48 → 3568.48] And I think the way we do this is actually through prayer.
[3568.48 → 3569.48] Right?
[3569.48 → 3573.48] Prayer gives us access to the very power of God.
[3573.48 → 3577.48] You know, in our passage, remember, I said, remember this?
[3577.48 → 3580.48] And remember, something interesting that Luke tells us.
[3580.48 → 3582.48] We're told the girl met them where?
[3582.48 → 3587.48] On their way to the place of what?
[3587.48 → 3588.48] Place of prayer.
[3588.48 → 3589.48] The place of prayer.
[3589.48 → 3591.48] They were going to pray.
[3591.48 → 3594.48] And she intercepted them.
[3594.48 → 3602.48] And it's just like Satan to distract us while we're engaged in something as powerful as prayer.
[3602.48 → 3604.48] Seeking God.
[3604.48 → 3608.48] Asking him to do what only he can do.
[3608.48 → 3614.48] I guarantee you that demon did not want them to go to the place of prayer.
[3614.48 → 3621.48] And so how do you help someone who's in any kind of addiction, or who feels any sort of bondage?
[3621.48 → 3626.48] Whatever it may be, you begin to pray for that person.
[3626.48 → 3629.48] You realize, you know, I can't change their heart.
[3629.48 → 3633.48] Likely, you know, or maybe they can't even change their own heart.
[3633.48 → 3636.48] But I know someone who does.
[3636.48 → 3638.48] I know someone who can.
[3638.48 → 3640.48] I know the power of God.
[3640.48 → 3647.48] And the way to access that is through prayer.
[3647.48 → 3650.48] So why don't we pray right now?
[3650.48 → 3662.48] And I want to just give you a time, a moment of silent prayer to think about what God would be saying to you through this passage and Acts.
[3662.48 → 3664.48] And maybe someone comes to your mind.
[3664.48 → 3669.48] You know, maybe a certain bondage that you are feeling or that you know someone is struggling with.
[3669.48 → 3676.48] And I just want to invite you right now to stop and let's pray for these people that God puts on our hearts.
[3676.48 → 3677.48] Let's pray.
[3677.48 → 3705.48] Let's pray.
[3705.48 → 3712.48] Heavenly Father, you promised that through Jesus Christ that you would free the captive.
[3712.48 → 3717.48] That you would set the prisoner free.
[3717.48 → 3720.48] That you would pronounce liberty.
[3720.48 → 3724.48] And we thank you that you have done this.
[3724.48 → 3729.48] And we thank you that you continue to do this.
[3729.48 → 3735.48] Father, we thank you for the spirit of Jesus that you have given to your people.
[3735.48 → 3743.48] Would you help us to understand what true freedom looks like in our lives, the lives of others and in this world.
[3743.48 → 3745.48] To be free.
[3745.48 → 3747.48] To be free indeed in Jesus Christ.
[3747.48 → 3751.48] And to know that nothing can touch that or take it away.
[3751.48 → 3756.48] We pray in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.
[3756.48 → 3758.48] The true king and the Lord of all.
[3758.48 → 3759.48] Amen.
[3759.48 → 3760.48] Let's stand.
[3760.48 → 3764.48] Let's sing our song of response.
[3764.48 → 3777.48] Let's.
[3777.48 → 3781.48] The third verse that we'll sing today says blessings abound where'er he reigns.
[3781.48 → 3784.48] The prisoners leap to lose, lose their chains.
[3784.48 → 3790.48] The weary find eternal rest and all who suffer want are blessed.
[3790.48 → 3791.48] Feast eternal rest, all who suffer want are blessed.
[3791.48 → 3793.48] The CIE appear there.
[3793.48 → 3799.48] The!...
[3799.48 → 3804.48] The CIE though will but to the crew and gather all who suffer in this world.
[3804.48 → 3806.48] And we say the keeping bigger, that eternity will live, however, we Aristotle.
[3806.48 → 3810.48] The doing of Lego in theでしょう fainer's boots and blow a sword that steeply dominates unto him.
[3810.48 → 3818.98] Jesus shall win the Memory of the Son
[3818.98 → 3828.48] Does He success the journey's Tre prose
[3828.48 → 3836.48] His case with 산ين he is gone التعق
[3836.48 → 3845.48] Tell us the words and said no more
[3845.48 → 3854.48] People were told so every time
[3854.48 → 3863.48] Live on His love and sweetest song
[3863.48 → 3872.48] And in the voices of broken
[3872.48 → 3881.48] The early blood sings on His name
[3881.48 → 3890.48] Blessings of God are ever in me
[3890.48 → 3900.48] The prisoners keep losing their chains
[3900.48 → 3909.48] The weary finding in the lowest
[3909.48 → 3919.48] And all who stop the heart of last
[3919.48 → 3928.48] Let every creature rise and pray
[3928.48 → 3936.48] Where I have started to argue
[3936.48 → 3945.48] Nature's descendants of our God
[3945.48 → 3955.48] In the head of the pain that our God
[3955.48 → 3967.48] You may be seated
[3967.48 → 3968.48] So at this point in our worship service
[3968.48 → 3973.48] We respond to God and His word in worship
[3973.48 → 3975.48] By giving of our tithes and offerings
[3975.48 → 3976.48] And as John announced in the beginning
[3976.48 → 3980.48] Our designated offering this morning is for Bethesda
[3980.48 → 3985.48] And so may I ask the deacons to come forward
[3985.48 → 3987.48] And collect the morning offering
[4010.48 → 4011.48] Of God by giving of thee
[4014.48 → 4019.48] A daily beef star
[4019.48 → 4020.48] And so may I ask the word in my William
[4020.48 → 4024.48] Amen
[4025.48 → 4031.48] Amen
[4031.48 → 4033.48] Amen.
[4061.48 → 4063.48] Amen.
[4091.48 → 4093.48] Amen.
[4093.48 → 4095.48] Amen.
[4095.48 → 4097.48] Amen.
[4097.48 → 4099.48] Amen.
[4099.48 → 4101.48] Amen.
[4105.48 → 4107.48] So let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[4107.48 → 4114.48] This is a community prayer, we call it, for some of the needs in our own community in the world.
[4114.48 → 4119.48] And as we pray, I'm going to read Psalm 145.
[4119.48 → 4125.48] So I'll read a section, and I'll lead us in prayer, and we'll read Psalm 145 as we go.
[4125.48 → 4131.48] And then we'll close with saying the Lord's Prayer together, which we'll have up on the screen later.
[4131.48 → 4136.48] Okay, so please join me in prayer.
[4136.48 → 4146.48] The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.
[4146.48 → 4149.48] The Lord is good to all.
[4149.48 → 4154.48] He has compassion on all he has made.
[4154.48 → 4157.48] All your works praise you, Lord.
[4157.48 → 4160.48] Your faithful people extol you.
[4160.48 → 4166.48] They tell of your glory, the glory of your kingdom, and speak of your might.
[4166.48 → 4173.48] So that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendour of your kingdom.
[4173.48 → 4179.48] Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and your dominion endures through all generations.
[4179.48 → 4182.48] Lord, we praise you.
[4182.48 → 4193.48] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, the one true God, living and active in our world, from generation to generation the same.
[4193.48 → 4198.48] The God who our forbearers worshipped and who we worship.
[4198.48 → 4203.48] And Lord, by your grace, our children and grandchildren will worship.
[4203.48 → 4208.48] And Lord, we thank you that your kingdom through Christ has come.
[4208.48 → 4217.48] That Christ came, and he vanquished the powers of the evil one through his death on the cross and rising again.
[4217.48 → 4222.48] Because of that, Lord, we are alive and we are free.
[4222.48 → 4233.48] Lord, we pray that your gospel as it has an axe and as it has throughout the history of the church, Lord,
[4233.48 → 4242.48] that it would continue to go forth to all the dark places of the world, bringing freedom to those who are in bondage.
[4242.48 → 4254.48] Lord, we thank you for the many blessings that we have, and we lift so many prayers to you, all of our petitions and our needs.
[4254.48 → 4261.48] Lord, we want to, as you ask us to, pray for the leaders that you have set before us.
[4261.48 → 4269.48] We pray for the leaders of our nation, our province, and our civic leaders whom you have given authority.
[4269.48 → 4274.48] Lord, may they serve well and ultimately serve you and your purposes.
[4276.48 → 4283.48] The Lord is trustworthy in all of his promises and faithful in all he does.
[4283.48 → 4289.48] The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts all who are bowed down.
[4289.48 → 4296.48] The eyes of all look to you and you give them their food at the proper time.
[4296.48 → 4301.48] You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
[4301.48 → 4309.48] And so, Lord, we pray for those in our families and in our church who are downcast,
[4309.48 → 4316.48] who are ill, who are tormented mentally or physically.
[4316.48 → 4327.48] Lord, raise your healing hand and give them health and peace and draw them to yourself as you approach them.
[4327.48 → 4331.48] We think particularly of Angela.
[4331.48 → 4337.48] We think also of Fahd as he recovers from surgery.
[4337.48 → 4342.48] We think of those who recently and in the last weeks or months have lost loved ones.
[4342.48 → 4351.48] And Lord, would you help, Lord, all of these with your care and your compassion,
[4351.48 → 4353.48] because you are the compassion of God.
[4353.48 → 4360.48] We pray for others in our congregation too who have long-standing ailments and health issues.
[4360.48 → 4365.48] Lord, help us to be your instruments to bear up those in need of prayer and help
[4365.48 → 4371.48] with encouragement, prayer and good counsel as well.
[4371.48 → 4376.48] The Lord is righteous in all of his ways and faithful in all he does.
[4376.48 → 4382.48] The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
[4382.48 → 4385.48] He fulfills the desires of those who fear him.
[4385.48 → 4388.48] He hears their cry and saves them.
[4388.48 → 4394.48] The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
[4394.48 → 4402.48] Lord, we lift to you our world which seems to be out of control.
[4402.48 → 4410.48] We especially, Lord, continue to pray for your hand in the conflict in your Holy Land,
[4410.48 → 4413.48] the land of Israel and Palestine.
[4413.48 → 4419.48] Lord, we pray that you would comfort those who mourn, those who have lost loved ones.
[4419.48 → 4424.48] And Lord, would you bring a de-escalation of conflict there?
[4424.48 → 4427.48] Would you bring your peace?
[4427.48 → 4434.48] And help us, Lord, not to be discouraged, but to come to the eternal and all-powerful and all-knowing God,
[4434.48 → 4440.48] knowing that nothing escapes your gaze, nothing escapes your sovereign purposes and your will.
[4440.48 → 4444.48] Help us to rest in that and to do what we can do to serve you.
[4444.48 → 4452.48] Lord, we also pray for classes, the meeting of churches locally here in Southwest BC,
[4452.48 → 4456.48] as we meet next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Lord, to do your business.
[4456.48 → 4462.48] Lord, we pray for Jonathan Huang, who is becoming a candidate for ordination.
[4462.48 → 4465.48] And we pray, Lord, for the other items on the agenda.
[4465.48 → 4469.48] Would you give the delegates your wisdom and heart?
[4469.48 → 4474.48] And Lord, would you give us a spirit of peace and unity as we meet?
[4474.48 → 4477.48] And Lord, we also pray for the ministry of Bethesda.
[4477.48 → 4481.48] We ask, Lord, that you would use our gifts that we bring to you,
[4481.48 → 4484.48] which is only a portion of that which we receive from you,
[4484.48 → 4488.48] and use it to support the work of Bethesda and the work of your church
[4488.48 → 4493.48] and to help those in need in Delta and around the world.
[4493.48 → 4496.48] My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[4496.48 → 4500.48] Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[4500.48 → 4503.48] And let us pray together the Lord's Prayer.
[4503.48 → 4505.48] Saying,
[4505.48 → 4509.48] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[4509.48 → 4515.48] Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4515.48 → 4523.48] Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[4523.48 → 4528.48] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[4528.48 → 4536.48] For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory now and forever. Amen.
[4536.48 → 4541.48] Please stand and let's go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4541.48 → 4546.48] I invite you to join us for time of fellowship right after the service.
[4546.48 → 4550.48] May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father,
[4550.48 → 4556.48] who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
[4556.48 → 4562.48] encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.
[4562.48 → 4563.48] Amen.
[4571.48 → 4584.48] We receive your blessing, we receive your grace.
[4584.48 → 4589.48] As we walk in love, shining from your face.
[4589.48 → 4594.48] May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4594.48 → 4599.48] We receive your blessing as we live.
[4599.48 → 4601.48] We receive your blessing as we live.
[4601.48 → 4603.48] We receive your blessing as we live.
[4603.48 → 4604.48] We receive your blessing as we live.
[4604.48 → 4609.48] Praise God from whom all blessings fall.
[4609.48 → 4614.48] Praise him of which is here before.
[4614.48 → 4619.48] Praise him above your heavenly hearts.
[4619.48 → 4629.48] Praise God from whom all blessings fall.
[4629.48 → 4632.48] Praise him of which is here before.
[4632.48 → 4638.48] Praise him above your heavenly hearts.
[4638.48 → 4641.48] Praise Father, Son, and praise him above your heavenly hearts.
[4641.48 → 4643.48] Praise Father, Son, and praise him above your heavenly hearts.
[4643.48 → 4648.48] We receive your blessing as we live.
[4648.48 → 4651.48] In His grace.
[4651.48 → 4679.48] Your love from people's light
[4679.48 → 4709.46] Thank you.
