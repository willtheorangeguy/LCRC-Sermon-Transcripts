• Following Jesus is a personal and unique journey, not a formulaic or step-by-step process.
• God doesn't always line up our strengths and desires with his plan for our lives.
• God often places us in situations where we feel unprepared or weak, rather than strong.
• God's guidance can be unpredictable and may involve stepping out of our comfort zones.
• God is glorified in our weakness, not in our strengths.
• God appears to Moses in a burning bush and tells him to go to Pharaoh
• Moses refuses due to feeling unqualified and lacking skills, but God assures him he will be with him and tell him what to say
• The story is used as an example for why God often calls people to situations where they feel ill-equipped
• This is so that God can be glorified through their lives and not in their own strength or abilities

• Luke includes himself as part of the group in verse 10
