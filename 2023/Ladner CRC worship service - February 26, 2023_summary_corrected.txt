• The people of Israel have been through hardships and have been unfaithful to God, leading to their exile in Babylon
• After 70 years, God brings them back to the land of Judah, but they find that things are not going well
• They look around and think that God is no longer interested in them, with the temple in disrepair and no visible king or prosperity
• The speaker discusses how people often question God's love when their lives don't go as planned.

• The story of Jacob and Esau as a demonstration of God's unconditional love for His chosen people
• Malachi's message in relation to Romans chapter 9 on election and God's purposes
• God's choice of Jacob over Esau was not based on merit or worthiness, but rather God's sovereign choosing
• God's love for Israel is unconditional and not based on their greatness or holiness
• The story of Jacob and Esau is a reminder that God's love is persistent and not deterred by human sinfulness
• God's choice to hate (or exclude) Esau means He chose to show His love to Jacob and the people of Israel, not Edom/Esau.
• God responds to Israel's doubts about his love by referencing history and experiences
• God's unconditional love is not based on earning or deserving but rather a gift
• Exile can be used for the good of God's people, to discipline them and bring them back to himself
• God's love is demonstrated through his actions in Israel's present situation, including defeating their enemies and protecting them
