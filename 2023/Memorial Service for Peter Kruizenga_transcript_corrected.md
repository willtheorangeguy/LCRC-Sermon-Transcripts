[811.38 → 814.08] beloved, good afternoon.
[814.08 → 820.46] On behalf of the cruising family, thank you for joining us for this time of worship.
[820.46 → 826.92] Margaret, Peter's sister, would have loved to be here, but she has come down with a cold.
[826.92 → 832.52] So she'll be watching on live stream and joining us on live stream.
[832.52 → 842.16] We're here to give praise, and thanks to God for the life of our dear friend and brother, Peter Using,
[842.70 → 850.06] and to take comfort in the victory of the Lord Jesus Christ over sin and death.
[850.96 → 856.74] We give glory to God because Peter ran the life of faith well,
[856.74 → 863.84] and he ran it to the end with his eyes fixed on his Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[864.74 → 868.96] So we are here to express our grief and sorrow,
[869.66 → 876.52] and also to mingle it with joy and gratitude as we come together to worship our great God.
[878.26 → 880.68] The Lord Jesus promised,
[880.68 → 885.86] I am the resurrection and the life.
[886.80 → 891.96] The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.
[892.84 → 897.80] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[899.50 → 902.52] Jesus also said in John 3, 16,
[902.52 → 908.18] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
[908.98 → 914.68] that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[917.26 → 919.86] David assures us in Psalm 23,
[921.28 → 926.74] Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life,
[927.16 → 931.58] and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[932.52 → 934.64] Let's pray together.
[938.08 → 939.30] Heavenly Father,
[939.96 → 940.50] Father,
[941.50 → 942.62] full of mercy,
[942.98 → 945.78] you are a God abounding with goodness and love.
[946.56 → 950.14] You know how to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted.
[950.98 → 953.62] You are a God who hears our cries
[953.62 → 957.06] and draws near to us in our sorrows.
[957.06 → 958.14] O God,
[958.20 → 959.90] we thank you for the promise
[959.90 → 962.14] and the sure hope
[962.14 → 964.24] that we will surely,
[964.44 → 966.98] surely dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[967.78 → 970.14] You have assured us of this great promise
[970.14 → 970.86] through the life,
[971.02 → 971.26] death,
[971.66 → 973.64] and resurrection of your Son,
[974.18 → 974.98] Jesus Christ,
[975.84 → 977.26] who is our Saviour,
[977.90 → 978.88] our Redeemer,
[980.14 → 981.62] the Shepherd of our souls.
[981.62 → 983.36] And we ask,
[983.48 → 983.80] O Lord,
[983.88 → 984.86] by your Holy Spirit,
[985.04 → 985.68] the Spirit
[985.68 → 987.92] of peace,
[989.04 → 990.20] the Spirit of comfort,
[990.90 → 992.62] that you would meet us
[992.62 → 994.74] in this time of worship
[994.74 → 996.86] and that you would abide with us
[996.86 → 999.10] as we remember
[999.10 → 1000.96] and as we give thanks to you,
[1001.08 → 1001.44] O God,
[1001.50 → 1002.22] for your servant,
[1002.66 → 1003.32] your Son,
[1003.78 → 1004.48] Peter Using.
[1005.18 → 1005.84] And would you,
[1006.02 → 1006.26] O God,
[1006.36 → 1006.60] Father,
[1006.78 → 1006.92] Son,
[1006.96 → 1007.60] and Holy Spirit,
[1007.78 → 1009.42] receive all honour and glory
[1009.42 → 1010.94] through our prayers,
[1011.32 → 1012.10] through our praises,
[1012.60 → 1013.36] through our tributes,
[1013.42 → 1014.00] and our worship,
[1014.78 → 1017.44] all for Jesus' sake,
[1018.04 → 1019.22] in whose name we pray.
[1019.90 → 1020.24] Amen.
[1021.52 → 1024.20] So Peter loved to sing hymns,
[1024.20 → 1025.86] and so let's stand
[1025.86 → 1026.86] and let's sing together
[1026.86 → 1028.46] to the glory of God.
[1028.82 → 1029.52] So please stand
[1029.52 → 1030.54] and we will sing
[1030.54 → 1031.44] the first song,
[1031.96 → 1033.48] This is My Father's World.
[1034.04 → 1034.86] Please rise.
[1034.86 → 1039.06] song 1 Biнаком
[1054.06 → 1057.28] This is My Father's Hodge,
[1057.76 → 1062.54] Beth,
[1062.54 → 1078.68] All Jesus that the temple we Unquote,
[1080.86 → 1091.94] All Jesus that He has forsaken us,
[1091.94 → 1101.26] This is my Father's new life, the birds and their arrows remain.
[1101.26 → 1110.42] The morning light, the day they bring, and the air their papers remain.
[1111.54 → 1120.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1120.24 → 1127.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1127.24 → 1141.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1141.24 → 1148.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1148.24 → 1155.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1155.24 → 1162.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1162.24 → 1169.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1169.24 → 1176.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1176.24 → 1183.24] This is my Father's new life, the sun's in all that's written.
[1183.24 → 1190.24] So at this time we will invite Tina to come up and share a few words with us.
[1190.24 → 1212.24] I'd like to begin by saying Peter and my mother, they had a connection to the eyes of the sun's in all that's written.
[1212.24 → 1228.24] It was one of their favourite songs, so we'll sing this right after.
[1228.24 → 1235.24] First, our deepest condolences, Pat, to you and the Using family.
[1235.24 → 1240.24] Peter, how can we describe Peter?
[1240.24 → 1251.24] He was kind, he could be quiet, compassionate, helpful, honest, stubborn, I call it determined, etc.
[1251.24 → 1256.24] In younger years, Peter had a passion for black cars.
[1256.24 → 1261.24] They were always shiny, buffed as if it belonged in the showroom.
[1261.24 → 1263.24] He was very fussy on them.
[1263.24 → 1267.24] Our family have known Peter for many years.
[1267.24 → 1270.24] He was a boarder at my mom's house.
[1270.24 → 1277.24] After immigration, my parents always had boarders, mostly six at a time.
[1277.24 → 1284.24] Our dad passed away at age 52 of a heart attack, much too young.
[1284.24 → 1288.24] Mom, being alone, still kept boarders.
[1288.24 → 1290.24] Peter was one of them.
[1290.24 → 1295.24] When he moved here from Winnipeg, he loved BC.
[1295.24 → 1297.24] He stayed, was happy.
[1297.24 → 1301.24] Other boarders left, either moved or got married.
[1301.24 → 1307.24] Peter became like a son or brother to us.
[1307.24 → 1311.24] He loved our children when they were very young.
[1311.24 → 1313.24] He became Uncle Peter.
[1313.24 → 1315.24] Many of them are here today.
[1315.24 → 1317.24] They're a little older now.
[1317.24 → 1320.24] We camped at many places.
[1320.24 → 1324.24] He loved kayaking, and he was a very strong swimmer.
[1324.24 → 1327.24] I could tell you some stories about that, but I won't.
[1327.24 → 1335.24] Peter stayed even when mom became weak and had a stroke and lost part of her eyesight.
[1335.24 → 1345.24] He was caring and compassionate and helpful in many ways, to which we as children were extremely grateful to this day.
[1345.24 → 1354.24] In their visits, they met Pat, who was a friend, also of mom's friends.
[1354.24 → 1362.24] To make a long story short, when mom passed on, Peter now alone, started to date Pat.
[1362.24 → 1366.24] After all, they knew each other from many visits.
[1366.24 → 1369.24] Well, the rest is history.
[1369.24 → 1375.24] We attended the wedding in Grand Rapids, a lovely celebration with Pat's family.
[1375.24 → 1380.24] Len Word was the best man and Joan made of honour.
[1380.24 → 1386.24] They recently celebrated the 25th anniversary and had a happy union.
[1386.24 → 1388.24] Travelled a lot.
[1388.24 → 1391.24] I'm sure Pat kept Peter going.
[1391.24 → 1395.24] They were both active in church life.
[1395.24 → 1401.24] Peter volunteered at the food bank and was in the accounting committee in their church for many years.
[1401.24 → 1405.24] Pat and Peter gave us many lovely dinners.
[1405.24 → 1411.24] Pat, being a great cook and baker, always outdid herself.
[1411.24 → 1421.24] A few years ago, when Pat got sick, Peter became her caregiver and was a great help and a loving husband.
[1421.24 → 1428.24] Pat, being a teacher and leader, is very creative and a lovely writer.
[1428.24 → 1430.24] She showed this in many ways.
[1430.24 → 1438.24] We felt in the last few years that Peter's energy dwindled, and he became quieter.
[1438.24 → 1442.24] We were shocked to hear of Peter's passing.
[1442.24 → 1445.24] Did not know that he was that ill.
[1445.24 → 1450.24] Pat, you will miss him dearly.
[1450.24 → 1453.24] We know you are strong and independent.
[1453.24 → 1459.24] We pray for God's strength and guidance as you carry on alone.
[1459.24 → 1462.24] Treasure the many years you had together.
[1462.24 → 1466.24] May God give you peace and cover you with his love.
[1466.24 → 1468.24] Blessings.
[1468.24 → 1470.24] Thank you.
[1470.24 → 1472.24] I think now we can sing the next song.
[1472.24 → 1474.24] Amen.
[1474.24 → 1476.24] Amen.
[1504.24 → 1506.24] Amen.
[1534.24 → 1536.24] Amen.
[1564.24 → 1566.24] Amen.
[1594.24 → 1596.24] Amen.
[1624.24 → 1626.24] Amen.
[1654.24 → 1656.24] Amen.
[1684.24 → 1686.24] Amen.
[1714.24 → 1716.24] Amen.
[1744.24 → 1746.24] Amen.
[1774.24 → 1776.24] Amen.
[1776.24 → 1778.24] Amen.
[1778.24 → 1780.24] Amen.
[1780.24 → 1791.24] Thank you, Tina, for sharing some of your stories.
[1791.24 → 1794.24] It was wonderful to hear more about Peter's life.
[1794.24 → 1798.24] And, you know, Peter has such an impact on so many of us.
[1798.24 → 1802.24] And so next, we're going to invite some of his family and friends,
[1802.24 → 1806.24] Nicole, Naomi, and Doug, to come up and share some scripture
[1806.24 → 1810.24] and also share some of the tributes that were expressed to Pat
[1810.24 → 1813.24] and the family just about how Peter had affected them.
[1813.24 → 1815.24] So come on up.
[1832.24 → 1847.24] Psalm 62, verses 1 and 2.
[1847.24 → 1851.24] Truly, my soul finds rest in God.
[1851.24 → 1853.24] My salvation comes from him.
[1853.24 → 1856.24] Truly, he is my rock and my salvation.
[1856.24 → 1858.24] He is my fortress.
[1858.24 → 1860.24] I will never be shaken.
[1860.24 → 1862.24] And now gentle, Amen.
[1862.24 → 1873.12] And we have a feeling of
[1873.12 → 1875.24] secrets to restore names.
[1875.24 → 1877.24] This is hostage archaic.
[1878.24 → 1880.24] And our destination calls us passion.
[1880.24 → 1888.24] And I will continue to ask you to keep the message out between
[1888.24 → 1891.08] and that they reflect the love and respect that we all feel.
[1892.66 → 1894.32] From Matt, a nephew.
[1895.20 → 1899.94] Uncle Peter, he was one of the kindest, most caring, and truly wonderful men.
[1900.02 → 1902.38] I was blessed to know and had the honour to call him uncle.
[1903.20 → 1904.06] He will be missed.
[1904.64 → 1905.62] Until we meet again.
[1907.04 → 1908.54] Another nephew, Dave.
[1908.54 → 1912.30] He was a nice, gentle person and will be missed.
[1913.54 → 1914.74] Nephew Arthur.
[1914.74 → 1920.74] All the Alberta Crazing clan express our sadness to hear about our Uncle Peter.
[1921.50 → 1923.22] We all thought highly of our uncle.
[1924.02 → 1930.08] He was such a pleasant man, and we will always remember his big smile and laughter when he was around our family.
[1931.64 → 1932.20] Myself.
[1932.82 → 1934.94] He was definitely a very good man.
[1935.36 → 1937.50] Looking forward to seeing him again one day.
[1939.74 → 1942.98] Deborah, who is a niece, and her husband Tom and their family.
[1942.98 → 1944.80] Uncle Peter.
[1945.46 → 1948.06] He was so loved by our family and will be missed.
[1948.60 → 1951.68] The kids talked last night about their favourite memories of Uncle Peter.
[1952.30 → 1955.72] He was a kind and gentle man and held a special place in our hearts.
[1956.88 → 1967.48] And apparently, Tom and Deborah's kids were also reminiscing, and they were thinking it was funny how Uncle Peter used to tease Aunt Pat about liking Winnie-the-Pooh.
[1967.48 → 1972.48] Nephew Doug and Christy.
[1972.96 → 1976.42] Peter was a great guy and a joy to have as part of our family.
[1979.88 → 1981.76] Nephew Brian and Rhonda.
[1981.76 → 1987.46] On our cruise from Alaska, Uncle Peter and Aunt Pat met us in Victoria.
[1987.78 → 1991.06] We were truly blessed by his kindness and generosity.
[1992.98 → 1994.76] From Renee and niece.
[1995.58 → 1998.94] Uncle Peter was another man I deeply loved who was gone.
[2000.40 → 2000.96] A friend.
[2001.72 → 2004.32] Always enjoyed having coffee chat with Peter.
[2004.94 → 2005.98] He was a good man.
[2006.14 → 2007.34] A real good man.
[2007.34 → 2010.04] So easy and cheerful to talk with.
[2010.48 → 2014.24] He had such a fine way of organizing everything and doing it so well.
[2015.86 → 2017.88] Elsa, the head of Strata.
[2018.88 → 2019.88] I loved Peter.
[2020.22 → 2021.40] He was a beautiful man.
[2022.98 → 2024.84] A tribute from loving wife Pat.
[2026.24 → 2029.76] Peter loved the Lord and was looking forward to being with his Lord one day.
[2030.60 → 2035.54] Thank you, Lord, for allowing me to share my life with Peter for almost 27 years.
[2035.54 → 2037.98] He was a very patient man.
[2039.80 → 2044.16] And I'll finish by paraphrasing a quote from Winnie-the-Pooh.
[2046.06 → 2051.16] How blessed we are to have someone so special that makes saying goodbye so hard.
[2051.16 → 2051.22] Thank you.
[2051.22 → 2051.26] Thank you.
[2065.54 → 2067.54] Thank you.
[2067.54 → 2068.54] Thank you.
[2068.54 → 2069.54] Thank you.
[2069.54 → 2076.34] We continue hearing these words from the psalmist in Psalm 62, verses 5 through 7, and verses 11 and 12.
[2076.34 → 2080.72] Yes, my soul finds rest in God.
[2081.56 → 2083.28] My hope comes from him.
[2084.12 → 2086.74] He truly is my rock and my salvation.
[2087.74 → 2088.98] He is my fortress.
[2089.78 → 2091.34] I will not be shaken.
[2092.48 → 2095.20] My salvation and my honour depend on God.
[2095.56 → 2099.12] He is my mighty rock and my refuge.
[2099.12 → 2104.44] One thing God has spoken.
[2105.50 → 2107.02] Two things I have heard.
[2108.16 → 2110.04] Power belongs to you, God.
[2110.04 → 2112.80] And with you, Lord, is unfailing love.
[2113.76 → 2118.22] And you reward everyone according to what they have done.
[2118.22 → 2148.20] Let's all rise.
[2148.22 → 2152.70] And let's sing our next song together, Nearer, My God, to Thee.
[2152.70 → 2154.70] Amen.
[2182.70 → 2184.70] Amen.
[2212.70 → 2214.70] Amen.
[2242.70 → 2244.70] Amen.
[2272.70 → 2274.70] Amen.
[2302.70 → 2304.70] Amen.
[2332.70 → 2334.70] Amen.
[2362.70 → 2379.16] So, Pat asked me to share a passage of scripture with you, Romans chapter 8 verses 38 to 39.
[2379.16 → 2387.02] And I didn't tell her this, but I'd even like to expand that just slightly to the fuller passage that it comes from.
[2387.02 → 2393.50] And I really want you to listen to this remarkable thing that Paul the writer says.
[2394.86 → 2397.82] So here's what he says, beginning in verse 28.
[2400.96 → 2410.88] And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
[2410.88 → 2423.04] For those God foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[2424.10 → 2426.54] And those he predestined, he also called.
[2427.30 → 2429.50] Those he called, he also justified.
[2430.42 → 2433.38] Those he justified, he also glorified.
[2434.36 → 2437.20] What then shall we say in response to this?
[2437.20 → 2441.44] If God is for us, who can be against us?
[2442.28 → 2453.32] He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
[2454.26 → 2457.74] Who shall bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[2458.52 → 2460.12] It is God who justifies.
[2461.00 → 2462.46] Who is he that condemns?
[2462.46 → 2473.30] Christ Jesus, who died, more than that, who is raised to life, is at the right hand of God, and is also interceding for us.
[2474.38 → 2476.84] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[2477.58 → 2485.22] Shall trouble, or hardship, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
[2486.08 → 2491.04] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[2491.04 → 2502.16] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[2502.98 → 2514.14] neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2515.28 → 2516.20] Let's pray.
[2516.20 → 2526.52] Heavenly Father, would you speak to us now with your words of assurance, hope, and comfort.
[2527.48 → 2530.88] Tell us, Lord, of your great love for us.
[2531.90 → 2539.96] And would that hope and that assurance, these words of love, Lord, sing deeply into our hearts that they might heal.
[2540.36 → 2541.52] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2541.74 → 2541.98] Amen.
[2541.98 → 2542.06] Amen.
[2542.86 → 2546.60] So friends, Paul says something absolutely remarkable here.
[2547.18 → 2563.90] He is saying that in our pain, in our sorrow, in our confusion, in our anger, in anything that we may be feeling or experiencing right now,
[2563.90 → 2565.90] God wants to give us something.
[2565.90 → 2572.96] And he wants to give you something that when you have it, it actually changes everything.
[2573.92 → 2578.58] And to have this means it changes your capacity to face anything.
[2579.10 → 2582.88] It changes your ability to go through any trial or through any hardship.
[2583.68 → 2589.26] And to have this is to have a changed life completely, both now and forever.
[2589.26 → 2591.48] And what is it?
[2592.26 → 2595.44] It is the absolute certainty of the love of God.
[2596.24 → 2601.52] The absolute certainty of the love of God.
[2602.48 → 2610.86] The certainty that God does not just love you now, but that he always will, no matter what happens.
[2610.86 → 2614.92] And that nothing can separate you from the love of God.
[2615.84 → 2624.70] Paul mentions in Romans 8, at least two huge things that do threaten to separate us from God's love.
[2625.32 → 2632.18] The first is, he says that we can have the certainty of God's love no matter what you do.
[2632.90 → 2633.08] Right?
[2633.14 → 2635.06] No matter what you do.
[2635.06 → 2640.38] You know, that's important because we all do foolish things.
[2641.08 → 2641.28] Right?
[2641.32 → 2643.42] We all do things that we regret.
[2644.56 → 2647.72] We do things that we are ashamed of.
[2648.66 → 2653.60] And we do things that intentionally or unintentionally hurt other people.
[2654.30 → 2659.00] And we've all had moments when we think or feel, you know, how could I have done this?
[2659.18 → 2661.66] Or how could I be this way?
[2661.66 → 2668.20] Or how could God love me after this?
[2669.58 → 2675.28] So many of us, you know, we walk around with this kind of invisible scales over our heads.
[2675.28 → 2680.14] And we're hoping that our good deeds will somehow outweigh our bad deeds.
[2680.14 → 2684.18] And maybe just enough so that God will love me.
[2684.46 → 2685.80] And God will accept me.
[2685.90 → 2687.76] And God will let me into heaven one day.
[2687.76 → 2694.40] Now, that's often the way we feel and think and go through life.
[2694.54 → 2696.10] What does Paul say about this?
[2696.64 → 2704.82] He says that for those who belong to Jesus Christ, this scale that we carry around above our heads is destroyed.
[2705.74 → 2710.44] There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[2710.44 → 2715.90] Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen.
[2716.80 → 2719.44] There's only one person who could possibly do that.
[2719.70 → 2720.50] Jesus Christ.
[2721.08 → 2723.58] And he, friends, is the one who has died for us.
[2724.30 → 2726.70] He's the one who rose for us.
[2727.08 → 2734.20] And he is the one who sits right now at the right hand of the Father ever advocating for us.
[2734.20 → 2744.66] Friends, those who know Christ, for us, there is not a single thing that you could ever do that would tip the scale against you.
[2745.40 → 2745.52] Right?
[2745.62 → 2754.06] Nothing can bring you into condemnation because God's verdict over your life is already in.
[2755.34 → 2758.78] And through Jesus Christ, that verdict is you are forgiven.
[2759.88 → 2760.80] You're loved.
[2761.58 → 2763.68] You are welcomed into the arms of God.
[2764.90 → 2769.72] You know, it's kind of like trying to put toothpaste back into the tube.
[2770.24 → 2770.48] Right?
[2770.72 → 2771.76] It can't be done.
[2772.78 → 2777.50] And in the same way, we cannot reverse what God has already declared.
[2778.68 → 2780.02] That he loves us.
[2780.38 → 2781.72] That in Christ we are forgiven.
[2783.08 → 2787.92] Peter has received this unconditional love of God right now.
[2788.54 → 2792.68] And so do all of us who are in Christ Jesus.
[2792.68 → 2795.58] But that's not all.
[2795.58 → 2801.16] Paul says not only can you have certainty of God's love for you no matter what you do,
[2802.10 → 2808.10] but also you can be certain of God's love for you no matter what happens to you.
[2808.10 → 2810.18] No matter what happens to you.
[2811.00 → 2816.58] You know, in our passage, he offers quite a list of terrible things that could happen to you.
[2816.58 → 2827.52] He says trouble, hardship, persecution, famine, nakedness, meaning poverty, danger, sword.
[2827.86 → 2829.26] You know, and we could add our own.
[2829.92 → 2831.08] Hurt or pain.
[2831.08 → 2832.08] Pain.
[2832.08 → 2833.14] Mental illness.
[2833.84 → 2834.28] Cancer.
[2835.40 → 2835.92] Suffering.
[2836.86 → 2837.58] Isolation.
[2837.80 → 2838.36] Loneliness.
[2838.76 → 2839.98] Relational brokenness.
[2840.28 → 2840.62] Death.
[2841.72 → 2841.98] Right?
[2842.08 → 2843.24] Life is so painful.
[2843.24 → 2847.28] The world that we live in is beautiful.
[2847.56 → 2848.48] It is wonderful.
[2849.38 → 2850.88] But it is oh so broken.
[2851.88 → 2858.72] And I don't need to convince any of us here of the inescapable sorrow of the human experience.
[2858.72 → 2873.02] And sometimes when things happen to us, you know, especially in moments like this when someone whom we deeply love and who is dear to us dies, we wonder what's happening.
[2874.10 → 2875.84] You know, where is God in all of this?
[2876.30 → 2879.46] And does God really love me?
[2880.56 → 2884.22] And God says emphatically, yes.
[2884.22 → 2889.24] No matter what we face in this life, God's love is certain.
[2890.98 → 2894.82] Paul has this amazing statement that he says here.
[2895.20 → 2897.28] He says, I am convinced.
[2898.02 → 2899.02] That is a key word.
[2899.30 → 2900.14] I am convinced.
[2900.46 → 2901.80] I am absolutely certain.
[2902.46 → 2914.20] And then he opens up the floodgates of his imagination, and he tries to think of just anything that could possibly stop the love of God for us, his people.
[2914.22 → 2930.60] He says, neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present or the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation.
[2930.80 → 2937.36] Nothing, nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.
[2937.36 → 2945.54] Friends, not even death, not even death can separate us from the love of Christ.
[2946.72 → 2953.36] And this is what's being offered to every single one of us, this bedrock certainty of the love of God.
[2954.24 → 2966.62] And no matter what you do, no matter what happens to you, you are held by the sovereign, unstoppable, unfailing, always and forever love of God.
[2967.36 → 2972.30] And the certainty that Paul's talking about, it's not based on a feeling.
[2973.88 → 2981.32] It's not based on a vague belief in God or the hope that everything will turn out okay in the end.
[2981.32 → 2982.00] It is based on a vague belief in God or the love of God.
[2982.02 → 2982.14] It is based on a vague belief in God or the love of God.
[2982.14 → 2992.28] It is based in the person of Jesus Christ, who was born, who lived and died for us, and rose again for us.
[2992.28 → 2999.48] And he guarantees a future when all death and all sorrow will be wiped away.
[3000.56 → 3003.10] The certainty of the love of God in Christ.
[3003.10 → 3012.32] and friends Peter embraced that and this certainty of the love of God is I know what is holding Pat
[3012.32 → 3019.08] together right now even in her sorrow and that's why she asked me to read this passage and for us
[3019.08 → 3025.26] to reflect on it today the love of God and this love of God friends is available to you
[3025.26 → 3034.26] without anything you have to do to earn if it is freely given as a gift of God's amazing grace to
[3034.26 → 3042.46] you the absolute certainty of the love of God for you in Christ Jonathan Edwards was a pastor in the
[3042.46 → 3049.64] 18th century he once preached a sermon in which he said that despite all the horrors and pains and
[3049.64 → 3055.90] the sorrows of the Christian experience or the human experience that Christians can still be
[3055.90 → 3063.58] the most happy of all people how is it that Christians can be happy in spite of all that
[3063.58 → 3072.52] happens to us well he said first because we know that bad things turn out for good we know that
[3072.52 → 3080.78] because of God's love because he is good because he is in control and despite all the pain and sorrow
[3080.78 → 3089.66] that happens God is writing a story that we will one day see in full the end of the story will come
[3089.66 → 3098.16] it will all be resolved bad things will turn out for good second he said the reason we can be happy
[3098.16 → 3106.62] is because the good things can never be taken away from us right so though we find ourselves temporarily
[3106.62 → 3114.92] separated from Peter we know he is now with Jesus Christ we know right now that he is secure
[3114.92 → 3127.56] in Christ's love he is safe from all harm he is more alive than he has ever been the good things even
[3127.56 → 3133.78] life with Peter life with loved ones can never be taken away even by death
[3133.78 → 3142.40] so we are happy because bad things turn out for good because good things can't be taken away and
[3142.40 → 3151.04] finally Edward said because the best things are yet to come somebody once asked a pastor whether we would
[3151.04 → 3160.80] know one another in heaven and he answered well actually we won't really know each other until we get to heaven
[3161.84 → 3163.68] because the best things are yet to come
[3165.84 → 3173.04] and so because they're yet to come what we do right now is we wait right we are waiting Peter is waiting we are all
[3173.04 → 3178.64] waiting for the day when Jesus Christ will renew all things he will renew the heavens and the earth
[3178.64 → 3190.48] he will raise us to life he will restore our broken bodies and hearts and minds he will wipe away all tears and all sorrow he will banish death itself
[3190.48 → 3203.60] and we will see Peter as God sees him all has seen him all along right shining in the glory of God's presence that's how God sees each one of us
[3203.60 → 3211.04] and we'll see Peter in that glory maybe sitting in a garden of geraniums or rowing his kayak
[3213.68 → 3219.04] you know what an amazing thing God offers to us friends the certainty of God's love for us in Christ
[3220.72 → 3229.28] Peter and Pat have claimed that love of God, so many have claimed that love of God, and it's anyone's for the taking
[3229.28 → 3239.20] the confidence to know that neither life or death nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ friends that is our hope
[3240.40 → 3242.80] thanks be to God let's pray together
[3244.64 → 3253.76] our father we are so grateful for our brother Peter a gracious and generous man
[3253.76 → 3261.60] our father, and we are thankful for the joy that he has brought to so many people as we've heard these tributes that were
[3262.24 → 3265.92] that were shared about the impact that he has had on so many lives
[3267.20 → 3273.28] we are thankful for that the imprint of your love that we have experienced through him
[3274.32 → 3279.60] and we thank you that you have welcomed him into your presence as your faithful son
[3280.56 → 3287.28] we join our hearts with Peter's in praising your name father we praise you for the promises in your word
[3287.28 → 3295.92] that through faith in Jesus we have the unshakeable assurance of life because Jesus gave his own life for us
[3297.20 → 3304.96] we thank you that you have called Peter to believe in your son and to now receive your gift of eternal life
[3304.96 → 3310.00] and yet we are separated temporarily from the one that we love
[3312.40 → 3320.64] so father we ask that you would continue your ministry of comfort for Pat for all of these dear
[3320.64 → 3326.88] family and friends that are gathered here today would you comfort us with the knowledge that Peter is no
[3326.88 → 3332.56] longer a stranger or pilgrim on this earth but that through Jesus he is now home
[3334.32 → 3340.40] and Lord would you give us a quiet and confident faith in the one who loved us and who gave himself
[3340.40 → 3344.32] for us, we pray in Jesus name amen

[3438.66 → 3454.82] In the darkness of peace, at the night of fear, when the days of life have come,
[3454.82 → 3472.12] I will never stand, guide my feet, on my hand, take my hand, precious Lord, give me hope.
[3480.02 → 3480.92] Let's pray.
[3480.92 → 3488.96] Heavenly Father, into your hands we commit to your brother, your servant Peter,
[3489.50 → 3495.08] your son who is loved and approved, a worker who need not be ashamed.
[3496.30 → 3501.28] We rejoice that as you live, he also lives.
[3502.06 → 3506.34] And as you have triumphed over death, he too triumphs over death.
[3506.34 → 3513.56] And as you have risen from the dead, so too Peter, with all who know Christ, will rise from the dead.
[3514.46 → 3521.16] Receive him now into the arms of your mercy, as you welcome him into your kingdom.
[3522.10 → 3525.24] In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[3525.24 → 3528.30] Friends, receive the benediction.

[3535.92 → 3540.10] so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[3540.82 → 3544.50] In the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[3545.56 → 3545.98] Amen.

[3610.68 → 3622.18] Oh, he holds a picture, and life is worth the living, just in our spirit.
[3624.18 → 3638.18] I see you, Lord, on your own baby, and be the brother that joy begins.
[3638.18 → 3652.18] I'm your spirit, and all I'm sure will use, each child will face a certain day, for God's life.
[3652.18 → 3664.18] I see you, Lord, on your own baby, and be the brother that joy begins.

[3682.56 → 3684.56] I'll be his love, because I know he is.
[3684.56 → 3699.56] And then one day, I'll cross that river, I'll find the sky, the Lord will be.
[3699.56 → 3703.56] I'll be his love, because I know he is.
[3703.56 → 3706.56] I'll be his love, because I know he is.
[3706.56 → 3711.56] I'll be his love, because I know he is.
[3711.56 → 3716.56] I'll be his love, because I know he holds a picture, and life is worth the living, just in our spirit.
[3716.56 → 3721.56] I'll be his love, because he lives, and he holds a picture, and life is worth the living, just in our spirit.
[3721.56 → 3728.56] I'll be his love, because he lives, and life is worth the living, just in our spirit.
[3728.56 → 3746.56] I'll be his love, because he lives, and life is worth the living, just in our spirit.
[3746.56 → 3756.56] I'll be his love, because he lives.
[3756.56 → 3761.56] You may be seated.
[3761.56 → 3769.56] Friends, we are so grateful today that you have come, and all of you are invited to a reception that is in the fellowship hall,
