[1252.54 --> 1259.54]  You may be seated.
[1259.54 --> 1270.54]  When we gather to praise God, we remember that we are people who have preferred our wills to his.
[1270.54 --> 1275.54]  We have not loved God above all, and our neighbors as ourselves.
[1275.54 --> 1285.54]  Accepting his power to become new persons in Christ, let us confess our sin before God and one another.
[1285.54 --> 1293.54]  Awesome and compassionate God, you have loved us with unfailing, self-giving mercy, but we have not loved you.
[1293.54 --> 1298.54]  You constantly call us, but we do not listen.
[1298.54 --> 1306.54]  You ask us to love, but we walk away from neighbors in need, wrapped in our own concerns.
[1306.54 --> 1312.54]  We condone evil, prejudice, warfare, and greed.
[1312.54 --> 1325.54]  God of grace, as you come to us in mercy, we repent in spirit and in truth, admit our sin, and gratefully receive your forgiveness.
[1325.54 --> 1330.54]  Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.

[1339.54 --> 1344.54]  He's my only comfort in my life, and in my death.
[1345.54 --> 1351.54]  You have fully paid for all my sins, and all my ends.
[1351.54 --> 1363.06]  Even when I struggle to believe, with your precious blood you take me free.
[1363.06 --> 1388.04]  I am not my own, but be loved, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1388.04 --> 1400.96]  You preserve my life in such a way that without me, not a hair that fall from me unless you will do.
[1400.96 --> 1413.72]  Even when I'm lost in desperation, all things work together for us to be strong.
[1413.72 --> 1435.72]  I am not my own, but be loved, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1435.72 --> 1449.72]  Always by your Holy Spirit you will show me all eternal life and make me willing and ready.
[1449.72 --> 1460.72]  Even when I can't see my way through, from now on to all is good for you.
[1460.72 --> 1484.54]  I am not my own, but be loved, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1484.54 --> 1510.54]  I am not my own, but be loved, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1510.54 --> 1540.52]  I am not my own, but be loved, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1540.52 --> 1542.52]  Thank you.
[1542.52 --> 1543.52]  Thank you.
[1543.52 --> 1545.52]  Thank you.
[1545.52 --> 1546.52]  Thank you.
[1546.52 --> 1547.52]  Thank you.
[1547.52 --> 1551.52]  Thank you.
[1551.52 --> 1562.52]  Today I'll be reading John 4, verse 4 to 42.
[1562.52 --> 1574.22]  Now he had come through Samaria, so he came to a town in Samaria, a solid Sychar, near the plot of ground where Jacob had given to his sons, Joseph.
[1575.46 --> 1576.70]  Jacob's well was there.
[1577.94 --> 1582.10]  Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well.
[1582.84 --> 1584.94]  It was about six o'clock or noon.
[1585.74 --> 1587.52]  Six hours, I think, in the Bible.
[1587.52 --> 1593.86]  When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, Will you give me a drink?
[1595.18 --> 1597.16]  His disciples had gone to town to buy food.
[1598.10 --> 1602.66]  The Samaritan woman said to him, You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman.
[1603.54 --> 1607.86]  How can you ask me for a drink for Jews to not associate with Samaritans?
[1608.92 --> 1614.30]  Jesus said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,
[1614.30 --> 1617.86]  you would have asked him, and he would have given you the living water.
[1619.10 --> 1623.92]  Sir, the woman said, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.
[1624.72 --> 1626.16]  Where can you get this living water?
[1627.14 --> 1631.02]  Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself,
[1632.02 --> 1633.86]  as did also his sons and his livestock?
[1633.86 --> 1639.58]  Jesus answered, Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.
[1640.42 --> 1644.36]  But whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
[1645.64 --> 1651.92]  Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spirit of water welling up to eternal life.
[1653.30 --> 1660.74]  The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.
[1660.74 --> 1665.34]  He told her, Go, call your husband and come back.
[1666.78 --> 1668.18]  I have no husband, she replied.
[1669.30 --> 1671.78]  Jesus said to her, You are right when you say you have no husband.
[1672.36 --> 1677.86]  The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband.
[1679.58 --> 1681.18]  What you have said is quite true.
[1683.22 --> 1685.52]  Sir, the woman said, I can see that you are a prophet.
[1685.52 --> 1691.56]  Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is Jerusalem.
[1692.58 --> 1700.06]  Woman, Jesus replied, Believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
[1701.80 --> 1703.88]  You Samaritans worship what you do not know.
[1704.52 --> 1707.74]  We worship what we do know, for the salvation is from the Jews.
[1707.74 --> 1716.12]  Yet a time is coming, and has now come, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[1717.16 --> 1719.48]  For they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.
[1720.66 --> 1725.60]  God is the spirit, and his worshippers must worship in the spirit and in truth.
[1727.08 --> 1731.14]  The woman said, I know that Messiah, called Christ, is coming.
[1731.86 --> 1733.98]  When he comes, he will explain everything to us.
[1733.98 --> 1738.82]  Then Jesus declared, I, the one speaking to you, am he.
[1740.32 --> 1743.94]  Just then his disciples returned, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman.
[1744.60 --> 1748.92]  But no one asked, what do you want, or why are you talking with her?
[1750.12 --> 1755.38]  Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, come.
[1756.12 --> 1758.48]  See, a man who has told me everything I have ever did.
[1759.48 --> 1760.34]  Could this be the Messiah?
[1760.34 --> 1760.44]  Yeah.
[1761.46 --> 1764.26]  They came out of the town and made their way towards him.
[1765.50 --> 1769.38]  Meanwhile, his disciples argued, urged him, Rabbi, eat something.
[1770.58 --> 1775.14]  But he said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know anything about.
[1777.00 --> 1781.32]  Then his disciples said to each other, could someone have brought him food?
[1781.32 --> 1787.96]  My food, he said, is the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.
[1789.40 --> 1791.20]  Don't you have a saying?
[1792.56 --> 1794.06]  It's still four months until harvest?
[1794.60 --> 1796.88]  I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields.
[1797.40 --> 1798.26]  They are ripe for harvest.
[1798.26 --> 1810.90]  Even now, the one who reaps draws a wage and has harvests a crop for eternal life.
[1811.36 --> 1813.84]  So the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
[1814.80 --> 1817.76]  Thus the saying, one sows and the other reaps, is true.
[1817.76 --> 1822.44]  I sent you to reap what you have not worked for.
[1823.24 --> 1826.78]  Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.
[1828.06 --> 1832.58]  Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony.
[1834.06 --> 1835.64]  He told me everything I ever did.
[1836.80 --> 1841.88]  So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with him, and he stayed for two days.
[1841.88 --> 1845.66]  And because of his words, many more became believers.
[1846.52 --> 1850.00]  They said to the woman, we no longer just believe because of what you have said.
[1851.04 --> 1855.62]  Now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is really the savior of the world.
[1871.88 --> 1873.30]  Well, good morning.
[1874.10 --> 1874.84]  Ladner is here.
[1874.92 --> 1875.16]  I see.
[1875.88 --> 1881.20]  This is my annual pilgrimage down to this part of the world to preach.
[1881.62 --> 1887.62]  And it is the furthest church I have to drive to to preach in the summertime.
[1888.28 --> 1889.54]  But I do it gladly.
[1889.66 --> 1895.36]  It gives me a chance to come here in person and say thank you for supporting the campus ministry,
[1895.36 --> 1904.04]  this really strategic mission of our church denomination to the students and staff and faculty at UBC Okanagan.
[1904.70 --> 1909.98]  And you support this work through your classical ministry shares and also through a secondary offering.
[1910.20 --> 1914.20]  And Ladner has been really, really generous over the years to support this work.
[1914.96 --> 1922.10]  I just thank you for it on behalf of my board and all the people who are touched by our church's work
[1922.10 --> 1924.68]  among the university community.
[1925.84 --> 1931.38]  One thing I wanted to ask you just to keep in prayer, it's something that we're really excited about.
[1932.40 --> 1937.40]  The campus ministry is actually expanding, which is fantastic.
[1938.14 --> 1943.36]  And this is long-laid plans which have only come to fruition just recently.
[1944.22 --> 1947.92]  In Kelowna, we have the University of British Columbia's second campus.
[1947.92 --> 1952.38]  We also have a community college called Okanagan College, which has about 10,000 students at it.
[1952.86 --> 1960.94]  And we've decided as a campus ministry that we're going to hire a part-time person for Okanagan College to start in September.
[1961.18 --> 1965.30]  So we've finalized these plans and we've raised some funds for it.
[1965.64 --> 1969.66]  We're really, really excited and grateful to God for this opportunity to expand.
[1970.08 --> 1974.16]  There's very little Christian presence at Okanagan College.
[1974.16 --> 1981.60]  So this is a field that's ripe for the harvest, to use the phrase that we just heard in the scripture.
[1981.90 --> 1986.74]  So please keep that in prayer as you, as a church, as you pray for the campus ministry.
[1986.98 --> 1992.76]  And July 16th, I think, when you have your secondary offering, do think about this expansion
[1992.76 --> 1997.00]  and what God is doing at Okanagan College.
[1997.00 --> 2001.44]  That's enough for me.
[2001.68 --> 2004.76]  I'm here to preach and bring you God's word.
[2005.22 --> 2006.92]  Let's bow our heads and say a prayer.
[2009.92 --> 2017.24]  God made the words of my mouth, the meditations of all of our hearts, befitting and acceptable in your sight.
[2017.46 --> 2019.56]  Oh God, our rock and our redeemer.
[2019.56 --> 2049.54]  God made the words of my mouth, the meditations of all of our hearts, befitting and the
[2049.56 --> 2055.10]  incredible story and probably a month worth of sermons packed into this story.
[2055.20 --> 2061.36]  But I want to just take 20 minutes and really focus in on how this story challenges us to
[2061.36 --> 2063.48]  be the church, to be the people of God.
[2064.38 --> 2070.06]  Because Jesus says in verse 14 to the woman,
[2070.06 --> 2074.74]  Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
[2076.36 --> 2084.58]  Indeed, the water I give you will become a spring of water, welling up to eternal life.
[2086.88 --> 2089.16]  It's a beautiful image.
[2089.76 --> 2092.30]  And it's an image of us, the church.
[2093.14 --> 2095.10]  We've received living water.
[2095.10 --> 2101.42]  The Holy Spirit has drawn us into the very life of Jesus Christ.
[2101.54 --> 2103.38]  Jesus who lived for us.
[2103.56 --> 2105.00]  Jesus who died for us.
[2105.58 --> 2108.80]  Jesus who was raised to life for us.
[2109.14 --> 2113.74]  And this living water, the Holy Spirit, becomes in us like a spring of water,
[2113.74 --> 2119.78]  welling up to eternity and spilling out into the world.
[2119.78 --> 2128.10]  So I want you to think of the church, of us, as a kind of oasis in the desert.
[2129.08 --> 2136.26]  A well in a dry place through which the grace and mercy of our God pours out into our families,
[2136.86 --> 2139.68]  into our neighborhoods, our communities, into the world.
[2139.94 --> 2143.20]  This life-giving water of God.
[2143.20 --> 2150.46]  I want to read this story with you from Luke's gospel, John's gospel of the women in the well,
[2150.60 --> 2159.90]  as a story about God's mission, his desire to reach out to those who are thirsting and bless them and save them,
[2160.30 --> 2165.46]  to be living water, to give living water to those who are parched,
[2165.60 --> 2170.22]  and to do all this through us, through his people.
[2170.22 --> 2178.04]  My family and I lived in Central Africa for a number of years.
[2178.20 --> 2180.50]  We worked as Presbyterian missionaries.
[2181.08 --> 2184.80]  And as a pastor, I would often get called out to village churches
[2184.80 --> 2187.40]  because there was never enough ordained clergy around.
[2187.72 --> 2189.96]  So I would go out to do the sacraments primarily.
[2190.68 --> 2196.94]  And so we would drive through the countryside on dirt roads, through the bush,
[2196.94 --> 2200.28]  and we'd pass through these little hamlets, little villages.
[2201.00 --> 2204.72]  And we'd always marvel as a family as we drove through these villages.
[2205.10 --> 2208.90]  There'd be a hand-pump well in the center of the village.
[2209.84 --> 2214.68]  And there was this cluster of life around the well.
[2215.76 --> 2217.12]  Women would be pumping water.
[2217.12 --> 2220.34]  And little kids would be splashing in the water.
[2221.00 --> 2224.28]  And teenagers would be loitering around the well.
[2224.90 --> 2229.40]  And chickens and goats and dogs would be drinking up the water as it spilled over.
[2229.52 --> 2232.96]  There was life all around the well.
[2232.96 --> 2237.80]  I think it's an image of what the people of God are.
[2238.54 --> 2240.88]  What this church is called to be.
[2242.08 --> 2244.88]  In the bustle of life around us.
[2245.82 --> 2252.40]  Because the water, the living water of the Spirit, is welling up in us and spilling out.
[2253.18 --> 2257.92]  Spilling out in the midst of these dry lands in which we live.
[2257.92 --> 2261.60]  I think we are living in dry lands.
[2261.98 --> 2264.84]  We're living in a bit of a parched place, aren't we?
[2265.10 --> 2265.70]  Not literally.
[2266.02 --> 2267.50]  You live in the soggy west coast.
[2268.28 --> 2270.38]  I mean spiritually, right?
[2271.44 --> 2274.46]  Canada is increasingly secular.
[2275.92 --> 2281.34]  We're, well, more and more people are identifying as non-Christian.
[2282.64 --> 2283.96]  In a recent census,
[2283.96 --> 2289.66]  50% of Canadians claim to be Christians.
[2289.86 --> 2292.10]  20 years ago, it was 70%.
[2292.10 --> 2293.76]  It's a precipitous drop.
[2293.98 --> 2297.44]  I took this slide off of the news in Kelowna.
[2298.30 --> 2300.58]  But it could be Ladner.
[2300.74 --> 2301.40]  It could be Delta.
[2301.66 --> 2303.04]  It could be anywhere in Canada.
[2305.64 --> 2308.66]  More and more people are leaving the church.
[2308.66 --> 2309.88]  And leaving the faith.
[2310.48 --> 2312.88]  These stats feel bleak.
[2312.88 --> 2318.78]  But these stats, they take flesh in our kids who don't come to church anymore.
[2319.02 --> 2322.62]  Or our grandkids who fall away from faith at university.
[2323.18 --> 2327.20]  Or our friends who left the church during COVID and never came back.
[2328.40 --> 2332.20]  2023 Canada is post-Christian.
[2332.20 --> 2336.10]  And it's not just a kind of growing faithlessness.
[2336.64 --> 2341.02]  I feel like there's a kind of growing hostility to Christianity too.
[2341.68 --> 2342.80]  Do you detect that at all?
[2343.20 --> 2344.10]  The news?
[2344.34 --> 2347.74]  I mean, I work in a particularly hostile place on the university campus.
[2347.88 --> 2349.54]  But I'm sure you've encountered it.
[2349.54 --> 2355.12]  It feels nowadays if you articulate a traditional Christian belief or behavior,
[2355.12 --> 2357.28]  the press goes after you.
[2357.38 --> 2358.72]  The media vilifies you.
[2358.86 --> 2360.50]  And I'm sure you've experienced that.
[2360.64 --> 2368.64]  And yet here we are in these parched lands called to be a wellspring of God's love and truth,
[2369.44 --> 2371.14]  His forgiveness and His righteousness.
[2371.14 --> 2378.36]  How are we to be the church in this parched post-secular Canada?
[2378.74 --> 2387.26]  It can be very tempting for us to kind of bury our head in the desert sand and circle the wagons.
[2389.02 --> 2390.98]  Stay out of sight, out of trouble.
[2390.98 --> 2397.90]  It's also very tempting for us to conform to this secular culture in which we live.
[2398.60 --> 2403.14]  I think Jesus in this story from John's gospel shows us a better way.
[2403.56 --> 2409.66]  I think He shows us a different way of being the church, of being a wellspring in this desert.
[2411.40 --> 2413.32]  Jesus doesn't attack it.
[2414.24 --> 2415.62]  Jesus doesn't run away from it.
[2416.28 --> 2419.20]  Jesus walks right into it.
[2419.20 --> 2422.24]  He walks right into these parched lands.
[2423.54 --> 2427.42]  The very first verse we heard this morning sets the scene for us.
[2428.28 --> 2430.70]  And I don't know if you caught it because it's an odd verse.
[2430.96 --> 2431.40]  Verse 4.
[2433.14 --> 2435.78]  Now he had to go through Samaria.
[2438.40 --> 2440.00]  That's technically not true.
[2441.44 --> 2444.20]  Jews, when they went from one end of the country to the other,
[2444.34 --> 2446.94]  if you bring up the map, we can see a picture of that.
[2446.94 --> 2451.14]  They went around Samaria.
[2451.74 --> 2454.84]  They didn't go through it, and they certainly didn't have to go through it.
[2455.12 --> 2457.04]  Samaria was an unclean place.
[2457.46 --> 2462.46]  As far as the Jews were concerned, it was filled with heretics and half-breeds.
[2462.62 --> 2464.06]  It was a hostile place.
[2464.78 --> 2465.86]  They went around it.
[2465.86 --> 2470.06]  If they went through it, they became ritually unclean.
[2471.90 --> 2474.16]  Jews did not have to go through Samaria.
[2474.32 --> 2476.68]  But our story says that Jesus did.
[2478.18 --> 2478.62]  Remarkable.
[2479.90 --> 2483.80]  Jesus has to go through Samaria because he's on God's mission.
[2483.80 --> 2488.38]  And this is a mission to seek out the lost and the lowly
[2488.38 --> 2491.92]  and to testify to the truth of who God is
[2491.92 --> 2494.90]  and how much he loves the whole world.
[2495.94 --> 2497.66]  So God's son doesn't stay put.
[2498.26 --> 2500.18]  He doesn't hide on safe ground.
[2500.30 --> 2501.90]  He goes into Samaria,
[2502.48 --> 2506.50]  into this hostile culture characterized by falsehood
[2506.50 --> 2509.12]  and deeply suspicious of God's people.
[2509.12 --> 2515.40]  He seeks it out on purpose because that's what God does.
[2516.50 --> 2518.44]  Let me raise the stakes a little higher, too.
[2518.64 --> 2521.12]  When he meets the woman at the well in Samaria,
[2521.28 --> 2522.96]  it's not just any old well.
[2523.82 --> 2525.54]  This is Jacob's well.
[2525.60 --> 2528.06]  It's one of their holiest sites
[2528.06 --> 2531.78]  because Father Jacob, the great patriarch,
[2532.22 --> 2533.28]  drew water from it.
[2533.84 --> 2536.92]  And it's within sight of Mount Gerizim.
[2536.92 --> 2538.16]  It doesn't say this in the story,
[2538.16 --> 2540.26]  but everybody back then would have known it.
[2540.64 --> 2542.30]  It's in sight of Mount Gerizim,
[2542.38 --> 2544.08]  which was like their holy mountain.
[2545.08 --> 2549.14]  So Jesus is on sacred turf, hostile sacred turf.
[2549.90 --> 2552.42]  You know, imagine in our case, I don't know,
[2553.06 --> 2555.14]  imagine having a conversation with a Mormon
[2555.14 --> 2557.76]  in Salt Lake City, okay?
[2557.98 --> 2562.48]  Or talking about Islam with a Muslim in Saudi Arabia.
[2563.34 --> 2566.86]  Or an atheist, where do atheists hang out?
[2566.86 --> 2568.70]  The Museum of Natural History.
[2569.02 --> 2570.02]  You know, you get the point, right?
[2570.10 --> 2574.14]  Jesus is on, he's not on friendly soil
[2574.14 --> 2576.62]  as he seeks to live out God's mission.
[2577.86 --> 2581.28]  One of my favorite Christian theologians and thinkers,
[2581.42 --> 2582.18]  Leslie Newbigin,
[2582.74 --> 2584.92]  says that the church is not meant
[2584.92 --> 2587.24]  to call men and women out of the world
[2587.24 --> 2590.44]  into a safe religious enclave,
[2590.44 --> 2594.20]  but to call them out in order to send them back
[2594.20 --> 2597.82]  as agents of God's kingship.
[2598.58 --> 2600.18]  Agents of the king,
[2600.54 --> 2603.88]  maybe even on enemy territory,
[2604.60 --> 2606.42]  maybe even in hostile places.
[2607.22 --> 2609.52]  This is what it means to follow Jesus Christ
[2609.52 --> 2613.06]  in our post-secular parched world.
[2613.06 --> 2621.22]  Yeah, it feels sad that Canada, Kelowna, Ladner
[2621.22 --> 2626.32]  are post-Christian and increasingly hostile to faith.
[2626.80 --> 2629.14]  This is an opportunity for us,
[2629.82 --> 2632.72]  an opportunity to live out God's mission.
[2633.78 --> 2636.54]  I tell you, says Jesus in verse 35,
[2637.16 --> 2639.60]  open your eyes, look at the fields,
[2639.60 --> 2642.22]  they are ripe for harvest.
[2643.20 --> 2645.08]  This is the world in which we live.
[2646.20 --> 2648.24]  When we go a little bit deeper into this story,
[2648.64 --> 2652.02]  I want us to notice who Jesus encounters,
[2652.28 --> 2655.18]  to whom he offers living water.
[2656.28 --> 2656.76]  In verse seven,
[2657.66 --> 2660.04]  a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
[2660.44 --> 2661.30]  and Jesus said to her,
[2661.96 --> 2663.14]  will you give me a drink?
[2664.22 --> 2666.40]  This is quite remarkable.
[2666.40 --> 2670.74]  A Samaritan, strike one.
[2672.20 --> 2675.22]  A woman in a man's world, strike two.
[2676.66 --> 2677.92]  And then later in the story,
[2678.02 --> 2680.04]  we find out she's had five husbands,
[2680.52 --> 2682.46]  and she's living with a man who's not her husband,
[2682.60 --> 2683.10]  strike three.
[2684.20 --> 2689.44]  But she's not out of the reach of God's love.
[2690.48 --> 2694.82]  God offers living water to everyone and anyone.
[2694.82 --> 2697.70]  No taboos, no distinction.
[2697.86 --> 2699.92]  There's no one too low or too poor,
[2700.48 --> 2703.34]  too insignificant, too corrupt, too crooked.
[2704.04 --> 2705.86]  A person might have the wrong politics,
[2706.20 --> 2708.20]  the wrong opinions, a different nationality,
[2708.26 --> 2708.98]  a different religion.
[2709.56 --> 2713.68]  God is seeking out all people with his living water.
[2714.44 --> 2717.86]  He's seeking them out to save and to bless all people.
[2717.86 --> 2722.40]  In fact, a chapter earlier in John's gospel,
[2722.70 --> 2724.66]  I thought about having us read this,
[2724.76 --> 2726.32]  but then I figured it would be too long
[2726.32 --> 2727.96]  with the long story from John 4.
[2728.82 --> 2730.46]  A chapter earlier in John's gospel,
[2731.98 --> 2733.60]  Jesus has another conversation
[2733.60 --> 2735.76]  with a very different person.
[2735.76 --> 2739.84]  This conversation doesn't take place
[2739.84 --> 2743.12]  at a well in the heat of the day,
[2744.12 --> 2746.10]  in sight of anyone passing by.
[2747.04 --> 2748.46]  You can bring up the next slide.
[2749.34 --> 2751.82]  It takes place in the cover of darkness,
[2752.52 --> 2753.18]  in secret.
[2754.36 --> 2755.36]  You probably know this story.
[2755.44 --> 2757.10]  This is the story of Jesus' conversation
[2757.10 --> 2758.12]  with Nicodemus.
[2759.40 --> 2761.86]  Nicodemus the Pharisee is everything
[2761.86 --> 2764.04]  the Samaritan woman is not.
[2765.10 --> 2766.62]  He's a man.
[2767.18 --> 2768.12]  He's powerful.
[2768.72 --> 2769.90]  He's orthodox.
[2770.44 --> 2771.54]  He's educated.
[2772.18 --> 2773.24]  He's well off.
[2774.56 --> 2776.06]  Jesus meets with him, too,
[2776.54 --> 2778.68]  and offers him living water.
[2779.60 --> 2781.10]  This huge contrast between
[2781.10 --> 2782.78]  the Samaritan woman and Nicodemus,
[2783.14 --> 2786.04]  put side by side in John's gospel,
[2786.52 --> 2787.90]  I think for a reason,
[2789.36 --> 2790.74]  Scripture is telling us
[2790.74 --> 2793.28]  that Jesus meets with anybody
[2793.28 --> 2794.24]  and everybody,
[2794.54 --> 2796.96]  and he wants us to do the same.
[2797.06 --> 2798.30]  The lesson for us is that
[2798.30 --> 2800.36]  everyone is thirsting for God.
[2801.16 --> 2802.96]  Everyone is thirsting for the good news,
[2803.04 --> 2804.12]  whether they know it or not.
[2805.88 --> 2807.34]  Now, in my line of work
[2807.34 --> 2809.26]  as a university chaplain,
[2809.86 --> 2811.90]  especially when I work with faculty,
[2812.04 --> 2812.78]  I'd say I meet,
[2813.10 --> 2814.86]  I probably meet more Nicodemus types.
[2815.58 --> 2816.56]  You know, these are educated.
[2816.56 --> 2817.42]  They're elite.
[2817.54 --> 2818.34]  They're influencers.
[2818.34 --> 2822.26]  Interestingly, many of them,
[2822.46 --> 2823.38]  like Nicodemus,
[2823.86 --> 2826.40]  are a little bit afraid
[2826.40 --> 2828.38]  to talk about faith on campus
[2828.38 --> 2830.06]  because of fear of repercussions.
[2831.02 --> 2832.10]  So we don't meet at night,
[2832.18 --> 2833.24]  but we do meet, you know,
[2833.26 --> 2834.76]  in the back corner of Starbucks
[2834.76 --> 2836.24]  where nobody can see us.
[2838.84 --> 2841.88]  I also meet women at the well, too,
[2842.62 --> 2843.58]  those types,
[2843.80 --> 2845.18]  and you do, too,
[2845.18 --> 2846.88]  because she's everywhere.
[2849.40 --> 2850.24]  Five husbands.
[2852.02 --> 2853.54]  Honestly, what did you think of her
[2853.54 --> 2854.60]  when we read that?
[2854.88 --> 2855.66]  What did you think of her?
[2856.96 --> 2857.76]  Kind thoughts?
[2859.36 --> 2860.20]  Probably not.
[2862.40 --> 2865.12]  You know, we don't know her story in detail.
[2865.12 --> 2868.38]  At that time,
[2868.52 --> 2871.14]  it was very, very easy for a man
[2871.14 --> 2873.70]  to put away his wife through divorce.
[2876.18 --> 2879.22]  So she might have been divorced five times.
[2881.40 --> 2882.66]  She might have been abandoned
[2882.66 --> 2884.12]  by her husband five times.
[2884.30 --> 2886.88]  She might have been widowed five times
[2886.88 --> 2888.78]  or some combination of that.
[2889.34 --> 2890.74]  We don't know her story,
[2890.74 --> 2893.60]  but she has a bruised heart.
[2894.50 --> 2896.48]  And if she were to tell us her story,
[2896.70 --> 2899.08]  there would be a trail of tears behind it.
[2900.08 --> 2901.48]  You know people like this, don't you?
[2902.38 --> 2903.38]  She's parched.
[2904.72 --> 2905.56]  She's dry.
[2906.96 --> 2908.16]  We know people like her.
[2909.66 --> 2910.92]  How many of your coworkers
[2910.92 --> 2912.54]  are broken in spirit?
[2912.94 --> 2914.04]  How many of your neighbors
[2914.04 --> 2917.96]  tell stories filled with tears like her?
[2917.96 --> 2921.24]  Sometimes a church is comfortable
[2921.24 --> 2923.40]  with the right kind of person.
[2924.16 --> 2925.36]  It might be the right race
[2925.36 --> 2926.92]  or the right social standing.
[2927.36 --> 2928.28]  Maybe the right person
[2928.28 --> 2929.16]  is someone who's married
[2929.16 --> 2931.08]  to one other person and not five.
[2932.84 --> 2934.22]  Whoever is thirsty,
[2934.98 --> 2936.38]  they're welcome here.
[2937.02 --> 2938.06]  Whomever is broken,
[2938.46 --> 2940.22]  the church is to be a wellspring
[2940.22 --> 2941.96]  for all people
[2941.96 --> 2943.80]  and all kinds of people.
[2943.80 --> 2948.24]  So maybe you're thinking
[2948.24 --> 2949.30]  right now in your head,
[2949.48 --> 2949.96]  all right, fine.
[2950.88 --> 2952.20]  I think I'm following Todd.
[2952.46 --> 2953.84]  I think I'm tracking this sermon.
[2955.02 --> 2956.14]  Ladner, CRC,
[2956.34 --> 2957.86]  we're supposed to be a wellspring
[2957.86 --> 2959.38]  of God's living water
[2959.38 --> 2962.44]  in this parched secular climate
[2962.44 --> 2963.34]  in which we live.
[2963.88 --> 2964.96]  If you're thinking this way,
[2965.08 --> 2965.92]  good job listening.
[2966.18 --> 2967.90]  That's a good summary of my sermon.
[2969.50 --> 2970.88]  How are we actually supposed
[2970.88 --> 2971.66]  to do this though?
[2971.66 --> 2973.92]  So it's fine and dandy
[2973.92 --> 2974.56]  for the preacher
[2974.56 --> 2975.34]  to stand up here
[2975.34 --> 2976.76]  and tell you to do it
[2976.76 --> 2978.34]  and say this is who you are,
[2978.40 --> 2980.12]  but how do we actually
[2980.12 --> 2980.74]  go about doing that?
[2980.76 --> 2982.04]  It's not that easy in practice,
[2982.04 --> 2982.46]  is it?
[2983.28 --> 2983.94]  And you're right.
[2984.04 --> 2985.60]  It's not easy for us
[2985.60 --> 2988.78]  to be a wellspring.
[2992.10 --> 2993.68]  There are lots of ways
[2993.68 --> 2995.66]  that the church witnesses
[2995.66 --> 2996.74]  to Jesus Christ
[2996.74 --> 2998.74]  that we share living water,
[2999.46 --> 3001.48]  works of mercy and justice,
[3001.66 --> 3003.40]  living faithfully
[3003.40 --> 3004.16]  and righteously
[3004.16 --> 3006.52]  in our homes as families,
[3007.44 --> 3009.34]  supporting Christian schools
[3009.34 --> 3010.90]  like I saw in the bulletin
[3010.90 --> 3011.82]  you're going to do
[3011.82 --> 3012.58]  a little bit later,
[3013.42 --> 3014.72]  prayer for the world,
[3015.50 --> 3016.82]  lots of ways to witness,
[3016.96 --> 3017.76]  to be a wellspring.
[3018.46 --> 3019.94]  I want to sharpen
[3019.94 --> 3021.32]  on just one thing though,
[3021.58 --> 3022.16]  which is maybe
[3022.16 --> 3023.24]  the most simple one,
[3023.24 --> 3027.16]  and that's talking about Jesus
[3027.16 --> 3029.08]  with our friends,
[3029.26 --> 3029.70]  our neighbors,
[3030.62 --> 3031.26]  our coworkers,
[3032.42 --> 3035.18]  simply sharing about Jesus.
[3036.76 --> 3038.06]  It's the simplest thing.
[3038.20 --> 3038.74]  I didn't say it was
[3038.74 --> 3039.76]  the easiest thing.
[3039.98 --> 3041.32]  It's the simplest thing.
[3041.80 --> 3042.62]  Most of us aren't
[3042.62 --> 3043.72]  very good at it though,
[3044.02 --> 3044.52]  are we?
[3045.32 --> 3046.78]  Maybe I shouldn't speak for you.
[3047.10 --> 3048.40]  I'm not very good at it
[3048.40 --> 3050.10]  and I kind of have to do this
[3050.10 --> 3050.72]  for my job.
[3052.88 --> 3054.42]  I've learned a few things though
[3054.42 --> 3057.54]  and this story from John 4
[3057.54 --> 3058.54]  has actually been
[3058.54 --> 3060.36]  one of the biggest ways
[3060.36 --> 3061.60]  that God has taught me
[3061.60 --> 3063.22]  how to talk about Jesus,
[3063.62 --> 3064.52]  how to share faith.
[3064.52 --> 3069.44]  I think how Jesus goes
[3069.44 --> 3070.36]  about this is brilliant.
[3072.28 --> 3073.42]  Take a look at these verses
[3073.42 --> 3074.60]  on the screen,
[3074.78 --> 3075.80]  verses 6 to 10.
[3078.20 --> 3079.44]  Take a moment and read them.
[3079.58 --> 3081.48]  I've edited them a little bit.
[3081.98 --> 3082.56]  You read them,
[3082.68 --> 3083.44]  I'm going to get myself
[3083.44 --> 3084.54]  a drink of water, okay?
[3084.54 --> 3084.62]  Okay.
[3094.52 --> 3107.52]  All right?
[3109.66 --> 3111.38]  So Jesus is exhausted.
[3112.22 --> 3113.96]  He collapses by the well.
[3114.50 --> 3115.94]  It's the sixth hour.
[3116.50 --> 3117.30]  It's hot.
[3118.64 --> 3119.56]  He's thirsty.
[3120.56 --> 3122.08]  He wants a drink of water.
[3123.08 --> 3124.08]  The Samaritan woman
[3124.08 --> 3125.20]  has come to the well
[3125.20 --> 3126.32]  in the middle of the day
[3126.32 --> 3128.32]  because she's disgraced.
[3128.46 --> 3129.26]  This is not when you would
[3129.26 --> 3130.32]  normally go draw water.
[3130.44 --> 3131.70]  You do it early in the morning
[3131.70 --> 3132.70]  or later in the day
[3132.70 --> 3133.36]  when it's cooler.
[3134.32 --> 3135.36]  She needs water.
[3135.84 --> 3136.84]  Jesus needs water.
[3138.60 --> 3139.72]  What do they talk about?
[3142.54 --> 3143.50]  Yeah, water.
[3143.60 --> 3144.54]  It wasn't a trick question.
[3144.54 --> 3146.12]  They talk about water.
[3148.60 --> 3149.68]  What's at hand?
[3150.60 --> 3151.68]  What's at hand
[3151.68 --> 3153.24]  becomes a pathway
[3153.24 --> 3155.26]  into a conversation
[3155.26 --> 3157.74]  about Jesus Christ.
[3158.42 --> 3159.48]  This is brilliant.
[3159.94 --> 3160.84]  So simple.
[3161.40 --> 3162.70]  This is the original
[3162.70 --> 3164.98]  water cooler conversation.
[3165.64 --> 3166.82]  You know this water cooler
[3166.82 --> 3168.16]  conversation idea, right?
[3168.80 --> 3169.92]  Back in the good old
[3169.92 --> 3170.76]  pre-COVID days
[3170.76 --> 3171.66]  when people actually went
[3171.66 --> 3172.68]  to the office to work
[3172.68 --> 3173.62]  and didn't work remotely.
[3174.30 --> 3175.58]  You would gather around
[3175.58 --> 3176.50]  the water cooler
[3176.50 --> 3178.02]  or the coffee pot
[3178.02 --> 3178.92]  in the office.
[3178.92 --> 3181.02]  And what did we talk about?
[3181.96 --> 3182.42]  Whatever.
[3183.32 --> 3184.72]  What we watched on television.
[3185.54 --> 3186.16]  The Canucks.
[3186.82 --> 3187.46]  The weather.
[3188.36 --> 3189.30]  The terrible coffee
[3189.30 --> 3189.84]  we're drinking.
[3190.00 --> 3191.16]  Whatever is at hand
[3191.16 --> 3192.52]  gets talked about.
[3192.52 --> 3195.56]  The point is
[3195.56 --> 3196.12]  that Jesus
[3196.12 --> 3197.78]  shows us
[3197.78 --> 3199.22]  that we can take
[3199.22 --> 3200.34]  whatever
[3200.34 --> 3201.56]  everyday thing
[3201.56 --> 3202.38]  is at hand
[3202.38 --> 3204.00]  even water
[3204.00 --> 3205.44]  the most common
[3205.44 --> 3206.50]  of all things
[3206.50 --> 3207.70]  and
[3207.70 --> 3208.74]  it can lead
[3208.74 --> 3209.76]  into a conversation
[3209.76 --> 3210.86]  about him.
[3212.26 --> 3212.74]  There's
[3212.74 --> 3213.52]  what I learned
[3213.52 --> 3214.08]  from this
[3214.08 --> 3215.50]  is there's no gimmicks
[3215.50 --> 3216.36]  or tricks
[3216.36 --> 3217.68]  to talking about Jesus
[3217.68 --> 3218.68]  with our friends
[3218.68 --> 3219.42]  or our family
[3219.42 --> 3220.24]  or neighbors.
[3220.24 --> 3222.10]  There's no gimmicks
[3222.10 --> 3222.88]  or tricks.
[3223.32 --> 3223.50]  No.
[3223.72 --> 3223.86]  It's
[3223.86 --> 3225.96]  whatever we're talking about
[3225.96 --> 3226.74]  with whomever
[3226.74 --> 3227.34]  we're speaking
[3227.34 --> 3228.60]  can become a pathway
[3228.60 --> 3230.78]  into a conversation
[3230.78 --> 3232.36]  about Jesus.
[3233.36 --> 3234.34]  Don't get me wrong.
[3234.40 --> 3234.76]  I don't think
[3234.76 --> 3235.46]  we should start
[3235.46 --> 3236.28]  conversations
[3236.28 --> 3237.66]  to try to push
[3237.66 --> 3238.68]  Jesus on people.
[3239.10 --> 3239.96]  What takes place
[3239.96 --> 3240.70]  between Jesus
[3240.70 --> 3241.94]  and the Samaritan woman
[3241.94 --> 3243.60]  is a real conversation.
[3244.20 --> 3244.76]  We can see
[3244.76 --> 3246.02]  how genuine it is
[3246.02 --> 3247.04]  because it
[3247.04 --> 3248.18]  unfolds
[3248.18 --> 3249.14]  before our eyes
[3249.14 --> 3249.86]  almost in
[3249.86 --> 3250.94]  in real time
[3250.94 --> 3251.20]  right?
[3251.28 --> 3251.84]  It's messy
[3251.84 --> 3253.12]  this conversation
[3253.12 --> 3253.70]  in John 4
[3253.70 --> 3254.74]  it's back and forth
[3254.74 --> 3256.12]  it's full of questions
[3256.12 --> 3257.66]  and retorts
[3257.66 --> 3258.98]  it's a real conversation
[3258.98 --> 3259.98]  it's not a pitch
[3259.98 --> 3261.38]  and it begins
[3261.38 --> 3262.04]  simply
[3262.04 --> 3264.12]  with what's at hand
[3264.12 --> 3265.26]  water
[3265.26 --> 3267.34]  and becomes a channel
[3267.34 --> 3268.36]  to a conversation
[3268.36 --> 3269.58]  about something deeper
[3269.58 --> 3270.96]  about Jesus
[3270.96 --> 3272.18]  as living water.
[3273.24 --> 3274.16]  This is really simple
[3274.16 --> 3275.08]  but I've learned
[3275.08 --> 3275.66]  from this.
[3275.66 --> 3278.62]  the Samaritan woman
[3278.62 --> 3279.48]  is everywhere
[3279.48 --> 3280.34]  we go.
[3281.84 --> 3282.98]  She's your classmate
[3282.98 --> 3283.62]  at school.
[3284.66 --> 3285.62]  She's standing
[3285.62 --> 3286.36]  beside you
[3286.36 --> 3287.02]  when you're watching
[3287.02 --> 3288.18]  your kids play soccer
[3288.18 --> 3289.50]  or your grandkids
[3289.50 --> 3290.08]  play soccer.
[3290.22 --> 3291.38]  She's broken hearted
[3291.38 --> 3292.44]  and parched.
[3293.08 --> 3293.76]  Maybe she doesn't
[3293.76 --> 3294.40]  even know it.
[3295.20 --> 3295.92]  We all know
[3295.92 --> 3296.74]  people like her.
[3297.60 --> 3298.06]  They're living
[3298.06 --> 3299.06]  in the apartment
[3299.06 --> 3299.74]  next to you
[3299.74 --> 3300.94]  in the retirement village.
[3300.94 --> 3302.12]  They're gathering
[3302.12 --> 3303.16]  at the coffee pot
[3303.16 --> 3304.12]  around
[3304.12 --> 3305.82]  the coffee pot
[3305.82 --> 3306.64]  in the office.
[3307.76 --> 3308.32]  Whomever
[3308.32 --> 3309.66]  wherever.
[3311.42 --> 3312.04]  There's a
[3312.04 --> 3315.12]  19th century poet
[3315.12 --> 3316.76]  Gerald Manley Hopkins
[3316.76 --> 3317.60]  who wrote a very famous
[3317.60 --> 3318.38]  poem called
[3318.38 --> 3319.42]  As Kingfisher's
[3319.42 --> 3320.26]  Catch Fire
[3320.26 --> 3321.84]  and there's a line
[3321.84 --> 3322.58]  in this poem
[3322.58 --> 3323.56]  where he says
[3323.56 --> 3324.82]  Christ plays
[3324.82 --> 3326.50]  in 10,000 places.
[3327.32 --> 3328.20]  I've always loved
[3328.20 --> 3328.78]  that line.
[3328.98 --> 3329.82]  Christ plays
[3329.82 --> 3332.14]  in 10,000 places.
[3332.98 --> 3333.74]  Wherever we are
[3333.74 --> 3334.40]  with whomever
[3334.40 --> 3335.08]  we're speaking
[3335.08 --> 3336.48]  Christ can play
[3336.48 --> 3337.66]  that conversation
[3337.66 --> 3339.34]  when we give him
[3339.34 --> 3339.98]  opportunity.
[3341.94 --> 3342.16]  Now
[3342.16 --> 3344.00]  not every conversation
[3344.00 --> 3344.78]  with
[3344.78 --> 3346.24]  soccer mom
[3346.24 --> 3347.04]  or
[3347.04 --> 3347.90]  beer league
[3347.90 --> 3348.76]  hockey dad
[3348.76 --> 3349.96]  needs to lead
[3349.96 --> 3351.04]  to Jesus Christ
[3351.04 --> 3352.44]  but the Holy Spirit
[3352.44 --> 3352.98]  will
[3352.98 --> 3353.94]  prompt us
[3353.94 --> 3354.44]  sometimes
[3354.44 --> 3355.66]  in our everyday
[3355.66 --> 3356.50]  conversations
[3356.50 --> 3357.96]  to witness
[3357.96 --> 3358.44]  to him.
[3359.10 --> 3359.68]  Whatever is at
[3359.68 --> 3360.14]  hand whatever
[3360.14 --> 3360.74]  we're talking
[3360.74 --> 3361.12]  about
[3361.12 --> 3362.28]  that could be
[3362.28 --> 3362.96]  an opportunity
[3362.96 --> 3363.98]  to share
[3363.98 --> 3364.98]  with our neighbor
[3364.98 --> 3365.82]  with someone
[3365.82 --> 3366.62]  who's parched
[3366.62 --> 3367.90]  the good news
[3367.90 --> 3368.96]  about Jesus Christ
[3368.96 --> 3371.10]  because God
[3371.10 --> 3371.64]  is seeking
[3371.64 --> 3373.00]  he's seeking
[3373.00 --> 3373.52]  people
[3373.52 --> 3374.84]  and he does it
[3374.84 --> 3375.52]  through us.
[3376.84 --> 3377.90]  This can happen
[3377.90 --> 3378.94]  in really difficult
[3378.94 --> 3379.66]  circumstances.
[3380.94 --> 3381.74]  This semester
[3381.74 --> 3382.36]  I was talking
[3382.36 --> 3383.54]  to a professor
[3383.54 --> 3384.30]  at UBC
[3384.30 --> 3385.40]  who's a Christian
[3385.40 --> 3386.44]  and she teaches
[3386.44 --> 3387.00]  anatomy.
[3388.40 --> 3389.08]  Now obviously
[3389.08 --> 3390.38]  she can't talk
[3390.38 --> 3391.00]  about Jesus
[3391.00 --> 3392.22]  in her class
[3392.22 --> 3392.92]  even though
[3392.92 --> 3393.72]  she'd like to
[3393.72 --> 3395.30]  and she loves
[3395.30 --> 3395.94]  her students.
[3396.14 --> 3396.66]  She knows that
[3396.66 --> 3397.30]  many of them
[3397.30 --> 3398.70]  are deeply hurting
[3398.70 --> 3400.02]  and some of them
[3400.02 --> 3400.90]  are really afflicted
[3400.90 --> 3401.80]  in mental health
[3401.80 --> 3402.64]  with mental health
[3402.64 --> 3403.20]  problems.
[3403.20 --> 3406.04]  she was showing
[3406.04 --> 3406.92]  me in her office
[3406.92 --> 3407.62]  some of her
[3407.62 --> 3408.76]  lecture slides
[3408.76 --> 3409.60]  like PowerPoint
[3409.60 --> 3410.60]  slides she puts
[3410.60 --> 3411.74]  up and she
[3411.74 --> 3413.90]  sneaks into her
[3413.90 --> 3414.96]  lectures little
[3414.96 --> 3416.64]  words, little
[3416.64 --> 3418.14]  thoughts that
[3418.14 --> 3418.98]  just might
[3418.98 --> 3420.76]  prompt some
[3420.76 --> 3421.60]  curious student
[3421.60 --> 3422.38]  to ask a further
[3422.38 --> 3422.88]  question.
[3423.46 --> 3423.92]  She showed me
[3423.92 --> 3424.66]  the slides she
[3424.66 --> 3425.22]  was teaching
[3425.22 --> 3426.80]  about the inner
[3426.80 --> 3430.04]  ear and she
[3430.04 --> 3430.70]  would say things
[3430.70 --> 3432.06]  like the ear
[3432.06 --> 3432.78]  was created
[3432.78 --> 3433.68]  to do this
[3433.68 --> 3434.94]  or this is
[3434.94 --> 3435.96]  so intricately
[3435.96 --> 3436.76]  designed
[3436.76 --> 3437.84]  and just those
[3437.84 --> 3438.44]  little words
[3438.44 --> 3439.96]  created and
[3439.96 --> 3440.50]  designed
[3440.50 --> 3441.58]  little prompts
[3441.58 --> 3442.52]  is anybody
[3442.52 --> 3443.02]  listening?
[3444.66 --> 3445.56]  Sometimes students
[3445.56 --> 3446.22]  come and ask her
[3446.22 --> 3446.68]  those things
[3446.68 --> 3447.24]  afterwards.
[3449.02 --> 3449.82]  She's not even
[3449.82 --> 3450.42]  mentioning the
[3450.42 --> 3451.12]  name of Jesus
[3451.12 --> 3452.48]  but these little
[3452.48 --> 3453.50]  hints can awaken
[3453.50 --> 3454.50]  a thirst for him
[3454.50 --> 3455.80]  that so many
[3455.80 --> 3456.56]  people have.
[3456.66 --> 3457.16]  People don't even
[3457.16 --> 3458.00]  know they had it.
[3458.98 --> 3459.72]  I find this too
[3459.72 --> 3460.58]  in conversations
[3460.58 --> 3461.22]  on campus
[3461.22 --> 3462.20]  and we're
[3462.20 --> 3463.00]  working in a
[3463.00 --> 3463.98]  context of an
[3463.98 --> 3464.78]  acute mental
[3464.78 --> 3465.58]  health crisis
[3465.58 --> 3466.50]  among younger
[3466.50 --> 3468.96]  people and when
[3468.96 --> 3470.66]  faculty or when
[3470.66 --> 3471.26]  students who
[3471.26 --> 3471.96]  aren't Christians
[3471.96 --> 3473.12]  share something
[3473.12 --> 3473.62]  about their
[3473.62 --> 3474.50]  struggles I'll
[3474.50 --> 3474.90]  say something
[3474.90 --> 3475.72]  like I'm going
[3475.72 --> 3476.14]  to keep you
[3476.14 --> 3476.88]  in my prayers.
[3477.14 --> 3477.48]  Just a little
[3477.48 --> 3478.32]  thought like that.
[3478.92 --> 3479.80]  No one actually
[3479.80 --> 3480.70]  takes offense at
[3480.70 --> 3480.80]  it.
[3480.88 --> 3481.26]  They want to
[3481.26 --> 3481.76]  hear more.
[3481.98 --> 3482.92]  Oh thank
[3482.92 --> 3483.16]  you.
[3483.78 --> 3484.66]  Just a hint.
[3485.88 --> 3487.16]  Begins to build
[3487.16 --> 3487.96]  a conversation
[3487.96 --> 3488.82]  perhaps about
[3488.82 --> 3489.60]  Jesus Christ.
[3490.58 --> 3492.14]  Those are just
[3492.14 --> 3492.98]  two examples
[3492.98 --> 3493.78]  but there's
[3493.78 --> 3498.72]  9,998 other
[3498.72 --> 3499.56]  places that
[3499.56 --> 3500.24]  Christ can
[3500.24 --> 3500.70]  play.
[3502.60 --> 3503.60]  Here's my last
[3503.60 --> 3503.88]  thought.
[3505.28 --> 3506.00]  I feel like
[3506.00 --> 3507.06]  for conscience
[3507.06 --> 3507.74]  sake I need to
[3507.74 --> 3508.66]  issue a little
[3508.66 --> 3509.36]  word of warning.
[3509.36 --> 3512.56]  If we're sharing
[3512.56 --> 3514.00]  Christ, if we're
[3514.00 --> 3515.18]  being a wellspring
[3515.18 --> 3516.56]  of God's love
[3516.56 --> 3518.30]  we should expect
[3518.30 --> 3518.78]  a little bit of
[3518.78 --> 3519.26]  pushback.
[3519.94 --> 3520.62]  It's not always
[3520.62 --> 3521.26]  going to be easy.
[3521.92 --> 3522.04]  Okay?
[3524.82 --> 3525.96]  Our story shows
[3525.96 --> 3526.72]  us this as well.
[3530.98 --> 3531.86]  When Jesus is
[3531.86 --> 3532.44]  talking to the
[3532.44 --> 3532.92]  woman at the
[3532.92 --> 3534.74]  well and over
[3534.74 --> 3535.48]  the course of the
[3535.48 --> 3538.20]  conversation she
[3538.20 --> 3539.44]  gets kind of
[3539.44 --> 3540.12]  closer and
[3540.12 --> 3540.66]  closer to
[3540.66 --> 3542.22]  Jesus in
[3542.22 --> 3543.04]  this conversation
[3543.04 --> 3544.32]  and at some
[3544.32 --> 3545.78]  point the
[3545.78 --> 3546.60]  resistance goes
[3546.60 --> 3546.90]  up.
[3547.44 --> 3547.80]  Maybe you
[3547.80 --> 3548.50]  notice this
[3548.50 --> 3549.52]  as she begins
[3549.52 --> 3550.16]  to squirm.
[3551.76 --> 3552.58]  Sir, the
[3552.58 --> 3553.18]  woman said,
[3554.08 --> 3554.60]  you have
[3554.60 --> 3555.22]  nothing to
[3555.22 --> 3556.04]  draw water
[3556.04 --> 3556.76]  with and the
[3556.76 --> 3557.38]  well is deep.
[3557.94 --> 3558.50]  Where can you
[3558.50 --> 3559.10]  get this living
[3559.10 --> 3559.46]  water?
[3560.32 --> 3560.48]  Right?
[3560.56 --> 3561.04]  Here we go.
[3562.34 --> 3562.94]  Are you
[3562.94 --> 3563.40]  greater than
[3563.40 --> 3563.82]  our father
[3563.82 --> 3564.72]  Jacob who
[3564.72 --> 3565.26]  gave us the
[3565.26 --> 3565.92]  well and drank
[3565.92 --> 3566.22]  from it
[3566.22 --> 3567.44]  himself and did
[3567.44 --> 3568.30]  also his sons
[3568.30 --> 3568.64]  and his
[3568.64 --> 3569.00]  livestock?
[3571.78 --> 3572.88]  You see what
[3572.88 --> 3573.42]  she's doing,
[3573.56 --> 3573.74]  right?
[3576.04 --> 3576.70]  Distracting them.
[3577.18 --> 3578.50]  This is textbook
[3578.50 --> 3579.76]  avoidance.
[3580.74 --> 3581.62]  She's uncomfortable
[3581.62 --> 3582.56]  as people
[3582.56 --> 3583.48]  sometimes are,
[3583.60 --> 3584.54]  often are,
[3585.02 --> 3585.74]  when we talk
[3585.74 --> 3586.30]  about Jesus.
[3587.04 --> 3587.66]  So she tries
[3587.66 --> 3588.12]  to take the
[3588.12 --> 3589.36]  conversation off
[3589.36 --> 3591.18]  the rails with
[3591.18 --> 3592.36]  a comment about
[3592.36 --> 3592.70]  Jacob.
[3596.50 --> 3597.36]  I'm sure you've
[3597.36 --> 3597.70]  been in
[3597.70 --> 3598.18]  conversations
[3598.18 --> 3598.86]  before with
[3598.86 --> 3600.08]  someone about
[3600.08 --> 3600.82]  a really
[3600.82 --> 3601.62]  serious,
[3602.22 --> 3603.02]  earnest matter
[3603.02 --> 3603.96]  and the
[3603.96 --> 3604.56]  other person
[3604.56 --> 3604.84]  in the
[3604.84 --> 3605.44]  conversation
[3605.44 --> 3606.74]  begins to
[3606.74 --> 3607.34]  bring up
[3607.34 --> 3609.06]  secondary things,
[3609.18 --> 3609.50]  things that
[3609.50 --> 3609.86]  aren't really
[3609.86 --> 3610.40]  relevant.
[3611.28 --> 3611.46]  You know,
[3611.52 --> 3612.22]  imagine you're
[3612.22 --> 3612.64]  having a
[3612.64 --> 3613.38]  conversation with
[3613.38 --> 3613.88]  your spouse.
[3614.00 --> 3614.54]  No, let's
[3614.54 --> 3615.04]  not go there.
[3617.94 --> 3618.84]  I'm sure you've
[3618.84 --> 3619.14]  been in a
[3619.14 --> 3619.90]  conversation like
[3619.90 --> 3620.32]  that, right?
[3620.96 --> 3621.62]  You're talking
[3621.62 --> 3622.04]  about something
[3622.04 --> 3622.82]  really important
[3622.82 --> 3624.70]  and then we
[3624.70 --> 3625.80]  end up arguing
[3625.80 --> 3626.88]  about secondary
[3626.88 --> 3627.56]  things.
[3628.46 --> 3629.10]  The primary
[3629.10 --> 3629.70]  thing gets
[3629.70 --> 3630.18]  lost.
[3630.70 --> 3631.16]  That's what's
[3631.16 --> 3631.84]  going on here.
[3632.08 --> 3632.40]  That's what
[3632.40 --> 3632.96]  she's trying
[3632.96 --> 3633.38]  to do.
[3634.44 --> 3635.08]  I get this
[3635.08 --> 3635.64]  actually quite a
[3635.64 --> 3636.20]  bit in my
[3636.20 --> 3636.68]  work when I'm
[3636.68 --> 3637.24]  talking about
[3637.24 --> 3637.48]  Jesus.
[3637.70 --> 3638.30]  In fact,
[3638.36 --> 3638.66]  I was just
[3638.66 --> 3639.34]  recently talking
[3639.34 --> 3639.94]  with a Muslim
[3639.94 --> 3641.86]  student who
[3641.86 --> 3643.04]  wanted to ask
[3643.04 --> 3643.38]  me some
[3643.38 --> 3644.10]  questions about
[3644.10 --> 3644.44]  Jesus.
[3645.00 --> 3645.46]  So of course
[3645.46 --> 3645.84]  I'm like,
[3645.94 --> 3646.54]  yes, let's
[3646.54 --> 3647.08]  meet and have
[3647.08 --> 3647.70]  a conversation
[3647.70 --> 3648.44]  about Jesus.
[3648.88 --> 3649.64]  And he asked
[3649.64 --> 3649.96]  some good
[3649.96 --> 3650.70]  questions and
[3650.70 --> 3651.02]  I started
[3651.02 --> 3651.64]  sharing a
[3651.64 --> 3651.90]  little bit
[3651.90 --> 3652.22]  about what
[3652.22 --> 3652.66]  Christians
[3652.66 --> 3653.28]  believe and
[3653.28 --> 3653.54]  what the
[3653.54 --> 3654.10]  Bible shows
[3654.10 --> 3654.64]  about Jesus
[3654.64 --> 3655.42]  and felt
[3655.42 --> 3655.70]  like we
[3655.70 --> 3656.02]  were getting
[3656.02 --> 3656.60]  deeper and
[3656.60 --> 3657.06]  deeper and
[3657.06 --> 3657.28]  deeper.
[3657.46 --> 3658.70]  And then I
[3658.70 --> 3659.26]  sensed him
[3659.26 --> 3659.62]  becoming
[3659.62 --> 3660.16]  uncomfortable.
[3660.16 --> 3660.80]  And then he
[3660.80 --> 3661.60]  blurts out,
[3662.54 --> 3663.12]  well, what
[3663.12 --> 3663.60]  about the
[3663.60 --> 3664.52]  Crusades in
[3664.52 --> 3664.84]  the Middle
[3664.84 --> 3665.30]  Ages?
[3667.32 --> 3668.08]  We're talking
[3668.08 --> 3668.82]  about Jesus
[3668.82 --> 3669.46]  and you're
[3669.46 --> 3669.90]  bringing up
[3669.90 --> 3670.60]  the Crusades?
[3670.66 --> 3671.14]  Yeah, those
[3671.14 --> 3671.80]  were terrible
[3671.80 --> 3672.46]  wars of
[3672.46 --> 3672.92]  religion.
[3673.54 --> 3674.22]  But I knew
[3674.22 --> 3674.56]  what he was
[3674.56 --> 3675.18]  doing though.
[3676.02 --> 3676.64]  He's trying
[3676.64 --> 3677.28]  to distract
[3677.28 --> 3678.44]  from the
[3678.44 --> 3678.92]  primary
[3678.92 --> 3679.46]  thing
[3679.46 --> 3680.36]  with
[3680.36 --> 3680.80]  secondary
[3680.80 --> 3681.42]  things.
[3682.98 --> 3683.66]  Jesus cuts
[3683.66 --> 3684.16]  right through
[3684.16 --> 3684.78]  her diversion
[3684.78 --> 3685.66]  tactics though.
[3686.34 --> 3687.32]  She tries it
[3687.32 --> 3688.74]  again with
[3688.74 --> 3689.12]  the second
[3689.12 --> 3689.78]  question I put
[3689.78 --> 3690.02]  here.
[3690.02 --> 3690.92]  Our ancestors
[3690.92 --> 3691.66]  worshipped on
[3691.66 --> 3692.20]  this mountain,
[3692.44 --> 3692.82]  et cetera,
[3692.94 --> 3693.32]  et cetera.
[3693.86 --> 3694.60]  She's trying to
[3694.60 --> 3695.26]  trip him up with
[3695.26 --> 3696.10]  some obscure
[3696.10 --> 3696.76]  theology.
[3698.12 --> 3698.88]  Jesus brings
[3698.88 --> 3699.72]  the conversation
[3699.72 --> 3701.04]  back to
[3701.04 --> 3701.74]  himself.
[3702.74 --> 3703.56]  He's bringing
[3703.56 --> 3704.34]  the conversation
[3704.34 --> 3704.98]  back to
[3704.98 --> 3706.28]  first things,
[3706.28 --> 3706.98]  to God
[3706.98 --> 3707.54]  who loved
[3707.54 --> 3708.10]  the whole
[3708.10 --> 3708.72]  world so
[3708.72 --> 3709.22]  much that
[3709.22 --> 3709.88]  he offers
[3709.88 --> 3711.04]  them living
[3711.04 --> 3712.00]  water.
[3712.46 --> 3713.26]  This is a
[3713.26 --> 3713.76]  genuine
[3713.76 --> 3714.56]  conversation,
[3715.04 --> 3715.46]  isn't it?
[3716.10 --> 3716.62]  It takes
[3716.62 --> 3717.14]  place in
[3717.14 --> 3717.80]  real time.
[3718.52 --> 3718.94]  It's a
[3718.94 --> 3719.58]  water cooler
[3719.58 --> 3720.76]  conversation.
[3721.24 --> 3722.12]  No formula.
[3722.76 --> 3722.96]  There's
[3722.96 --> 3723.72]  twisting and
[3723.72 --> 3724.06]  turning.
[3724.64 --> 3725.10]  Jesus has
[3725.10 --> 3725.42]  to keep
[3725.42 --> 3725.76]  on his
[3725.76 --> 3726.20]  toes.
[3727.54 --> 3728.36]  All these
[3728.36 --> 3729.26]  questions trying
[3729.26 --> 3730.26]  to sidetrack
[3730.26 --> 3730.72]  him from
[3730.72 --> 3731.12]  the real
[3731.12 --> 3731.50]  thing.
[3731.90 --> 3733.24]  Jesus as
[3733.24 --> 3734.34]  living water
[3734.34 --> 3735.48]  to those
[3735.48 --> 3735.98]  whose
[3735.98 --> 3736.80]  spirits are
[3736.80 --> 3738.14]  parched and
[3738.14 --> 3738.64]  whose hearts
[3738.64 --> 3739.74]  are hard
[3739.74 --> 3740.78]  and dry.
[3742.30 --> 3742.54]  And then
[3742.54 --> 3742.98]  finally,
[3743.82 --> 3744.76]  finally she
[3744.76 --> 3746.38]  drops her
[3746.38 --> 3746.92]  defenses.
[3747.70 --> 3748.50]  She's asked
[3748.50 --> 3749.14]  distracting
[3749.14 --> 3750.76]  questions and
[3750.76 --> 3751.26]  at the end of
[3751.26 --> 3751.94]  our story she
[3751.94 --> 3752.90]  asks the only
[3752.90 --> 3753.52]  question that
[3753.52 --> 3754.20]  really matters.
[3755.26 --> 3755.96]  Could this be
[3755.96 --> 3756.56]  the Messiah?
[3756.56 --> 3756.64]  Messiah?
[3759.94 --> 3760.78]  She drops
[3760.78 --> 3761.66]  her defenses and
[3761.66 --> 3762.36]  then she drops
[3762.36 --> 3763.44]  her water jar
[3763.44 --> 3764.96]  to follow
[3764.96 --> 3765.28]  Jesus.
[3765.72 --> 3766.16]  Who does that
[3766.16 --> 3766.68]  remind you
[3766.68 --> 3766.96]  of?
[3771.34 --> 3771.86]  Jesus'
[3771.98 --> 3772.34]  disciples,
[3772.72 --> 3773.32]  when he calls
[3773.32 --> 3773.92]  them on the
[3773.92 --> 3774.24]  seashore,
[3774.30 --> 3774.66]  they drop
[3774.66 --> 3775.14]  their nets
[3775.14 --> 3775.74]  to follow,
[3775.84 --> 3775.96]  right?
[3776.00 --> 3776.48]  She's become
[3776.48 --> 3777.00]  a disciple
[3777.00 --> 3777.66]  of Christ.
[3778.70 --> 3779.08]  In fact,
[3779.16 --> 3779.80]  she's become
[3779.80 --> 3780.88]  a wellspring.
[3781.98 --> 3782.34]  Maybe you
[3782.34 --> 3782.96]  noticed that in
[3782.96 --> 3783.58]  the story when
[3783.58 --> 3784.10]  it was read.
[3785.00 --> 3785.68]  Having committed
[3785.68 --> 3786.30]  herself to
[3786.30 --> 3786.64]  Jesus,
[3786.80 --> 3787.06]  what does
[3787.06 --> 3787.44]  she do?
[3787.60 --> 3788.32]  She immediately
[3788.32 --> 3789.24]  begins to tell
[3789.24 --> 3789.86]  her friends and
[3789.86 --> 3791.34]  neighbors about
[3791.34 --> 3791.80]  Jesus.
[3792.74 --> 3793.60]  It's beautiful.
[3794.22 --> 3794.90]  She's become a
[3794.90 --> 3795.32]  wellspring,
[3795.96 --> 3796.96]  bubbling up to
[3796.96 --> 3797.44]  eternity,
[3798.22 --> 3798.88]  pouring out
[3798.88 --> 3799.98]  into her
[3799.98 --> 3800.44]  community.
[3801.96 --> 3802.94]  Could you be a
[3802.94 --> 3803.72]  wellspring too?
[3804.58 --> 3805.56]  In your school,
[3805.70 --> 3806.20]  in your home,
[3806.84 --> 3807.64]  your workplace?
[3808.54 --> 3809.36]  Could Ladner
[3809.36 --> 3810.08]  Christian Reformed
[3810.08 --> 3811.50]  Church be a
[3811.50 --> 3812.34]  wellspring in this
[3812.34 --> 3813.30]  parched land?
[3814.72 --> 3815.42]  I know,
[3815.42 --> 3816.10]  I know your
[3816.10 --> 3816.76]  neighbors don't
[3816.76 --> 3817.66]  always look thirsty.
[3818.62 --> 3819.32]  I drove through
[3819.32 --> 3819.88]  the community
[3819.88 --> 3820.58]  this morning.
[3821.56 --> 3822.04]  The Starbucks
[3822.04 --> 3822.76]  was full,
[3823.18 --> 3823.82]  people were out
[3823.82 --> 3824.30]  jogging,
[3824.74 --> 3825.34]  they were walking
[3825.34 --> 3825.96]  their dogs.
[3826.20 --> 3826.92]  People look pretty
[3826.92 --> 3827.76]  happy actually.
[3828.90 --> 3829.80]  Are they thirsty
[3829.80 --> 3830.14]  though?
[3833.26 --> 3834.42]  I remember the
[3834.42 --> 3835.28]  doctor that we
[3835.28 --> 3836.42]  had in Malawi
[3836.42 --> 3837.86]  when I went to
[3837.86 --> 3838.30]  visit him with
[3838.30 --> 3838.96]  one of my kids
[3838.96 --> 3841.38]  who was dehydrated.
[3842.16 --> 3842.88]  They had a stomach
[3842.88 --> 3844.08]  bug and lost a lot
[3844.08 --> 3844.54]  of fluids.
[3846.16 --> 3847.08]  And the doctor
[3847.08 --> 3849.26]  said that when
[3849.26 --> 3849.96]  you're mildly
[3849.96 --> 3851.26]  dehydrated, you
[3851.26 --> 3852.16]  feel thirst.
[3853.28 --> 3854.12]  But he said
[3854.12 --> 3854.56]  what's really
[3854.56 --> 3856.46]  concerning is that
[3856.46 --> 3857.34]  when you're severely
[3857.34 --> 3859.38]  dehydrated, often
[3859.38 --> 3860.30]  the sense of thirst
[3860.30 --> 3860.90]  disappears.
[3862.70 --> 3863.92]  So people who are
[3863.92 --> 3865.32]  critically dehydrated,
[3865.72 --> 3866.94]  they're dying of
[3866.94 --> 3868.30]  thirst, and they
[3868.30 --> 3868.94]  don't even feel
[3868.94 --> 3869.36]  thirsty.
[3871.40 --> 3872.22]  And I wonder if
[3872.22 --> 3872.98]  that's where we are
[3872.98 --> 3874.20]  right now in Canada,
[3875.08 --> 3876.42]  in our post-Christian
[3876.42 --> 3877.32]  secular world.
[3878.06 --> 3879.04]  People are dying
[3879.04 --> 3880.78]  of thirst, and they
[3880.78 --> 3881.54]  don't even know it,
[3882.00 --> 3882.66]  and they don't even
[3882.66 --> 3883.14]  feel it.
[3884.34 --> 3885.44]  This is where God
[3885.44 --> 3887.08]  has put us, as a
[3887.08 --> 3889.02]  wellspring, through
[3889.02 --> 3890.36]  whom he offers
[3890.36 --> 3892.46]  living water to
[3892.46 --> 3893.72]  this world, to this
[3893.72 --> 3894.94]  town that he loves
[3894.94 --> 3896.18]  us so much.
[3898.20 --> 3898.92]  Let's commit
[3898.92 --> 3900.98]  ourselves to
[3900.98 --> 3902.30]  this God, and to
[3902.30 --> 3903.06]  being the kind of
[3903.06 --> 3904.00]  people he calls us
[3904.00 --> 3905.48]  to be, using the
[3905.48 --> 3906.10]  words of our
[3906.10 --> 3907.24]  confession of faith.
[3908.02 --> 3908.62]  This is from our
[3908.62 --> 3909.18]  Christian Reformed
[3909.18 --> 3910.62]  Church's confessional
[3910.62 --> 3911.90]  standard, our world
[3911.90 --> 3912.78]  belongs to God.
[3913.34 --> 3914.08]  There's two slides.
[3914.30 --> 3915.24]  I'll read the first
[3915.24 --> 3916.30]  one, and then I'd
[3916.30 --> 3917.28]  like you to join with
[3917.28 --> 3917.86]  me to read the
[3917.86 --> 3918.40]  second one.
[3919.14 --> 3919.78]  And as we do this,
[3919.82 --> 3920.40]  I'll invite the
[3920.40 --> 3921.32]  worship team back up
[3921.32 --> 3921.78]  on stage.
[3921.90 --> 3922.72]  Please rise.
[3922.72 --> 3922.80]  Please rise.
[3924.94 --> 3935.66]  In our world, we're
[3935.66 --> 3936.58]  many journey alone,
[3937.22 --> 3938.22]  nameless in the
[3938.22 --> 3939.16]  bustling crowd.
[3939.60 --> 3940.78]  Satan and his evil
[3940.78 --> 3942.22]  forces seek whom
[3942.22 --> 3943.60]  they may scatter and
[3943.60 --> 3944.16]  isolate.
[3944.80 --> 3946.34]  But God, by his
[3946.34 --> 3947.60]  gracious choosing in
[3947.60 --> 3949.52]  Christ, gathers a new
[3949.52 --> 3951.40]  community, those who,
[3951.40 --> 3952.52]  by God's gift, put
[3952.52 --> 3953.56]  their trust in Christ.
[3953.56 --> 3955.46]  In the new community,
[3955.76 --> 3956.52]  all are welcome.
[3957.22 --> 3958.54]  The homeless come home.
[3958.86 --> 3960.10]  The broken find healing.
[3960.66 --> 3961.82]  The sinner makes a new
[3961.82 --> 3962.16]  start.
[3962.28 --> 3963.92]  The despised are esteemed.
[3964.10 --> 3965.26]  The least are honored.
[3965.84 --> 3967.28]  And the last are first.
[3968.14 --> 3969.48]  Here the spirit guides,
[3970.00 --> 3971.22]  and grace abounds.
[3972.88 --> 3974.74]  Joining the mission of God,
[3975.40 --> 3977.08]  the church is sent with the
[3977.08 --> 3977.92]  gospel of the gospel of the
[3977.92 --> 3980.20]  kingdom, to call everyone
[3980.20 --> 3982.24]  to know and follow Christ,
[3982.88 --> 3985.18]  and to proclaim to all the
[3985.18 --> 3986.90]  assurance that in the name
[3986.90 --> 3988.52]  of Jesus, there is
[3988.52 --> 3991.04]  forgiveness of sin and new
[3991.04 --> 3993.34]  life for all who repent and
[3993.34 --> 3993.78]  believe.
[3994.58 --> 3996.44]  The spirit calls all members
[3996.44 --> 3999.10]  to embrace God's mission in
[3999.10 --> 4000.80]  their neighborhoods and in the
[4000.80 --> 4002.92]  world, to feed the hungry,
[4003.62 --> 4005.12]  bring water to the thirsty,
[4005.12 --> 4007.20]  welcome the stranger,
[4008.00 --> 4008.86]  clothe the naked,
[4009.58 --> 4010.66]  care for the sick,
[4011.22 --> 4012.50]  and free the prisoner.
[4013.32 --> 4015.24]  We repent of leaving this
[4015.24 --> 4016.36]  word to a few,
[4017.12 --> 4019.02]  for this mission is central
[4019.02 --> 4019.96]  to our God.
[4020.96 --> 4021.60]  Amen.
[4021.60 --> 4033.54]  In this song of response,
[4034.48 --> 4037.26]  it is an invitation to those
[4037.26 --> 4039.92]  who are thirsty and to drink
[4039.92 --> 4041.18]  from living waters.
[4042.68 --> 4046.66]  Perhaps this invitation is very
[4046.66 --> 4048.32]  meaningful for you this morning,
[4048.32 --> 4050.94]  and you want to come and drink
[4050.94 --> 4051.82]  from that living water.
[4051.96 --> 4053.76]  However, you may feel that you
[4053.76 --> 4055.06]  already have been drinking from
[4055.06 --> 4057.06]  this water for a long time,
[4057.42 --> 4060.96]  and so maybe you long to share
[4060.96 --> 4063.26]  the water that you have, the
[4063.26 --> 4064.34]  living water of Christ, with
[4064.34 --> 4064.88]  someone else.
[4065.30 --> 4066.88]  So as we sing this, I challenge
[4066.88 --> 4068.26]  you, if you are that person, to
[4068.26 --> 4070.96]  think about someone with whom you
[4070.96 --> 4074.08]  might share the living water and
[4074.08 --> 4076.06]  who that might be and what this
[4076.06 --> 4080.56]  invitation, how you might bring
[4080.56 --> 4082.42]  this invitation to that person.
[4082.42 --> 4085.02]  Holy Spirit.
[4085.02 --> 4086.12]  granels,
[4086.12 --> 4088.62]  how you
[4088.62 --> 4094.92]  eat my
[4095.08 --> 4095.42]  water
[4095.42 --> 4100.82]  are you empty,
[4100.90 --> 4103.34]  are you empty?
[4103.34 --> 4105.16]  Come and drink these
[4105.16 --> 4106.84]  through you forces.
[4106.84 --> 4113.80]  Tired and broken, peace unspoken
[4113.80 --> 4118.76]  Rest beside these living waters
[4118.76 --> 4127.92]  Christ is calling, find refreshing
[4127.92 --> 4132.98]  At the cross of living waters
[4132.98 --> 4139.86]  Lay it like down, all the unborn
[4139.86 --> 4143.98]  Rise up in these living waters
[4144.60 --> 4150.70]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love
[4150.70 --> 4154.98]  Bringing joy to the city of Haram
[4154.98 --> 4162.36]  There our hope is secure, do not fear anymore
[4162.36 --> 4167.24]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[4167.24 --> 4169.24]  Amen
[4169.24 --> 4177.08]  Spirit moving, mercy and washing
[4177.08 --> 4181.24]  Healing in those living waters
[4181.24 --> 4188.12]  Lay it like down, all the unborn
[4188.12 --> 4192.12]  Lighting in those living waters
[4192.12 --> 4200.12]  There's a river that flows with mercy and love
[4200.12 --> 4205.00]  Bring joy to the city of Haram
[4205.00 --> 4211.00]  There our hope is secure, do not fear anymore
[4211.00 --> 4217.00]  Praise the Lord of living waters
[4217.00 --> 4231.88]  uncomfortable, do not fear and love
[4231.88 --> 4233.88]  Ah yeah and mercy of owns
[4233.88 --> 4237.96]  Rosal treball
[4237.96 --> 4252.96]  Are you thirsty? Are you empty? Come and drink these living waters.
[4253.96 --> 4263.96]  Love, forgiveness, God's abundance, God's peace are living waters.
[4263.96 --> 4269.96]  Build a river that flows with mercy and love.
[4269.96 --> 4274.96]  We can drive to the city of God.
[4274.96 --> 4281.96]  There are hope, peace and peace, do not fear anymore.
[4281.96 --> 4286.96]  Praise them all of the living waters.
[4286.96 --> 4292.96]  There are hope, peace and peace, do not fear anymore.
[4292.96 --> 4302.96]  Praise the Lord of living waters.
[4302.96 --> 4317.96]  Good morning. I'll just be taking my paper out because Ashley said I've got to stay on topic. I guess she knows me pretty well.
[4317.96 --> 4327.96]  So, in your mailbox today, you picked up part two of the offering schedule. This year we decided to change it up a bit to break it into two parts.
[4327.96 --> 4333.96]  So, hopefully there will be some offerings that are, that hit home for some of you.
[4333.96 --> 4339.96]  So, and also this year, or right now, we have purchased new offering bags.
[4339.96 --> 4349.96]  Our whole collection plate had been seen a little wear and tear over the years and thought it was time for them to be retired.
[4349.96 --> 4359.96]  But just as an observation from us deacons concerning the flow of the offering, since COVID, we have spread out a bit more and making the passing of plates more difficult.
[4359.96 --> 4361.96]  And often feeling disjointed.
[4361.96 --> 4365.96]  So, please take the bag, even if you have nothing to give, and pass it to the next person in your aisle, as they may have something.
[4365.96 --> 4367.96]  Thank you.
[4367.96 --> 4369.96]  Thank you.
[4369.96 --> 4371.96]  Thank you.
[4371.96 --> 4373.96]  Thank you.
[4373.96 --> 4389.96]  Thank you.
[4389.96 --> 4391.96]  Thank you.
[4391.96 --> 4407.96]  Thank you.
[4407.96 --> 4411.96]  Thank you.
[4411.96 --> 4417.96]  And finally, as it's probably on the screen soon, but today's offering is for Delta Christian School.
[4417.96 --> 4427.96]  Not much has to be said about this cause, as we have many kids in our congregation that benefits from this place, and the Christian-focused education.
[4427.96 --> 4435.96]  Especially given our current culture climate we are living in, Christian education is even more vital to the health of our community and children.
[4435.96 --> 4437.96]  Thank you.
[4437.96 --> 4439.96]  Thank you.

[4608.94 --> 4615.94]  We pray for our world in which there is endless conflict.
[4615.94 --> 4619.94]  May your peace overcome oppression and war in Ukraine, in Iran, and so many other countries
[4619.94 --> 4623.94]  where your children suffer in ways we can only imagine.
[4623.94 --> 4627.94]  and so many other countries where your children suffer in ways we can only imagine.
[4629.06 --> 4634.02]  Give strength and endurance to the workers of World Renew and other agencies seeking to bring
[4634.02 --> 4640.50]  relief in these areas, as well as places where the basic necessities of life are scarce because of
[4640.50 --> 4648.18]  drought, flood, fire, and other natural disasters. Even here we have heard the prediction of
[4648.18 --> 4654.98]  unprecedented forest fires this year. We ask for your intervention in this for a minimal loss of
[4654.98 --> 4662.10]  life and property during the fire season. As the summer approaches we find joy in all that is
[4662.10 --> 4668.90]  flourishing around us. As many of us take vacation, may we also take opportunity to meditate on your
[4668.90 --> 4677.06]  beauty as we see it reflected in creation. Draw us close to you. As school is nearing a close for this
[4677.06 --> 4684.18]  year. May both students and their teachers and professors finish the year well. May the gifts
[4684.18 --> 4688.98]  of our offering this morning serve to further your kingdom through the work of Delta Christian School,
[4689.62 --> 4697.30]  preparing students for life through discipleship in Christ. We pray for Todd and the work he does at
[4697.30 --> 4704.58]  UBC Okanagan. We thank you for this new opportunity for expansion of this ministry and ask that you will
[4704.58 --> 4714.34]  lead, that you will bring the right staff person to help fill this slot for the new ministry. We ask that you
[4714.34 --> 4720.34]  will help Todd to walk in step with your spirit as you lead him to be winsome in the academic environment.
[4721.06 --> 4728.98]  Grant him and his family a good rest over the summer. We ask traveling mercies for all of us who drive the roads in these next months.
[4728.98 --> 4735.94]  We also lay before you this morning those in our fellowship and others we know who struggle with various losses
[4736.90 --> 4747.86]  of health, of relationships, of work, of finances, and of faith. We thank you too, Lord, for healing that you have given to some of us.
[4748.58 --> 4754.18]  We thank you for the healing you've given Pastor Nancy so far and to little Richie. We ask,
[4754.18 --> 4761.70]  Lord, that you will continue to give them healing. We ask, Lord, that you will be with Pat as she struggles in hospital.
[4762.18 --> 4772.90]  Will you also give her wholeness and Jordan as well? Be with all of those who in our midst are lonely,
[4773.46 --> 4780.90]  those who are still dealing with long-term illness, fatigue. Lord, will you be close to them?
[4780.90 --> 4789.62]  You know each of us, but we so often don't really know you. Instead of pulling away from you in times when we hurt,
[4790.18 --> 4794.58]  may we lean into you, discovering your unsurpassing peace and comfort.
[4797.46 --> 4806.42]  Lord, be with all those who walk a long road with many struggles, some physical, some mental, some spiritual,
[4806.42 --> 4815.70]  and some amongst us that don't share their pain. We recognize that not one of us is whole. We are all broken in some way.
[4816.58 --> 4823.86]  Come to us, Lord Jesus, and satisfy our deepest needs, giving us too stories that burst forth from our lips
[4823.86 --> 4832.34]  in praise to you so that others may thirst for your living water. For yours is the power and the glory forever. Amen.
[4832.34 --> 4834.34]  Amen.
[4846.50 --> 4848.02]  Please rise for God's blessing.
[4852.50 --> 4858.42]  May God pour his streams of living water on us, his people, and through us to this broken, parched world.
[4858.42 --> 4864.10]  Leave here with the blessing of God. May the deep, deep love of God our Father,
[4865.14 --> 4872.26]  and the abundant grace of Jesus Christ our Lord, and the abiding presence of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit,
[4872.90 --> 4877.22]  be upon you and your family this day and always. Amen.
