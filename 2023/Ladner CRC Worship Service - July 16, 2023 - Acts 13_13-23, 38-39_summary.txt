• God testified that David, son of Jesse, was a man after his own heart and would do everything he wanted him to do.

• God provided a king unlike the other nations by giving them David, who would shepherd his people.
• In the fullness of time, God provided a savior in Jesus, as promised through the lineage of David.
• A savior is someone who brings men and women to God, and that person is Jesus.
• Paul explained that forgiveness of sins can be obtained through faith in Jesus, which is not possible under the law of Moses.
• The law cannot save because humans are unable to keep it due to their sinful nature.
