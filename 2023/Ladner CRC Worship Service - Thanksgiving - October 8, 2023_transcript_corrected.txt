[0.00 → 10.64] V Thank you
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[270.00 → 299.98] Thank you.
[300.00 → 329.98] Thank you.
[329.98 → 330.98] Good morning, everyone.
[330.98 → 331.98] Good morning, everyone.
[331.98 → 332.64] Happy Thanksgiving.
[335.64 → 337.42] Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.
[338.02 → 340.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[340.16 → 341.20] My name is Jason True.
[341.32 → 343.86] I will be leading us in worship this morning.
[343.86 → 373.86] And there are a bunch of things.
[373.86 → 374.86] We will be talking to you, too.
[374.86 → 375.86] We will be talking to you, too.
[375.86 → 382.60] We will also have a time for an open mic, a time to share what we are thankful for.
[382.60 → 388.44] So we'll need you to be thinking about that, not speak too long.
[388.44 → 389.44] And we are doing this.
[418.44 → 424.06] Sunday. If you are interested in signing up for a small group, there is a sign-up sheet on the
[424.06 → 428.86] foyer table. And we're also looking for a couple volunteers for some ministries.
[429.72 → 437.34] Jana Kulun, who moved up to Prince George, she was in charge of the new moms celebrations for
[437.34 → 442.34] when there's a new baby, and also for the meal train ministry. And so those are kind of two
[442.34 → 449.60] positions. So if any of you are interested in taking on organizing one or the other, or both
[449.60 → 456.54] of those, please do speak to me about that. And so on this Thanksgiving Sunday, we have many reasons
[456.54 → 465.30] to give thanks to God. But the greatest of all is God's steadfast love for us through our Lord Jesus
[465.30 → 474.52] Christ. So this morning, let us come before God with thankful hearts. And God calls us into this
[474.52 → 486.62] special time of worship this morning with the words of Psalm 136 and Psalm 16. So where I will begin,
[486.72 → 490.80] and we'll read it responsibly, where it has the two double arrow, I'll invite you to read it out loud
[490.80 → 502.02] with me. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever. Give thanks
[502.02 → 512.08] to the God of gods, for his steadfast love endures forever. Lord, you alone are my portion in my cup.
[512.08 → 522.32] You make my lot secure. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places. Surely I have a
[522.32 → 530.40] delightful inheritance. So please join me in a prayer of adoration, and I will be reading parts of Psalm 65
[530.40 → 534.82] as our prayer. So please bow your heads and let's pray together.
[534.82 → 544.42] Father, you answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth
[544.42 → 553.68] and of the forest seas. The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders. Where morning dawns, where evening
[553.68 → 563.28] fades, you call forth songs of joy. You care for the land and water it. You enrich it abundantly.
[563.28 → 572.88] The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
[573.78 → 580.42] You drench its furrows and level its ridges. You soften it with showers and bless its crops.
[581.16 → 588.40] You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. The grasslands of the
[588.40 → 594.88] wilderness overflow. The hills are clothed with gladness. The meadows are covered with flocks.
[595.60 → 602.54] The valleys are mantled with grain. They shout for joy and sing. Great and awesome are you, O God,
[602.66 → 610.02] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. May you receive our highest thanks and praise as we gather to worship you
[610.02 → 619.50] this morning. In Christ's name, we pray. Amen. So friends, please stand and receive God's greeting to you
[619.50 → 628.22] this morning. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. And as God has called us
[628.22 → 634.38] and gathered us, let us turn and greet one another. Please turn and greet those around you.
[634.38 → 634.66] Amen.
[658.22 → 684.50] Okay. Let's join our voices together in a song and a hymn of Thanksgiving.
[684.50 → 706.96] Now make me all our God
[706.96 → 711.70] With hands and hands and voices
[711.70 → 717.60] Who wondrous things have done
[717.60 → 722.60] In whom his world rejoices
[723.16 → 727.90] Who from our others' hearts
[727.90 → 732.52] Has blessed us on our way
[732.52 → 737.40] With countless gifts of love
[737.40 → 742.30] As still is ours today
[742.30 → 748.40] O may this mountain's God
[748.40 → 754.22] Through all our life be near us
[754.22 → 759.18] With ever joyful heart
[759.18 → 765.00] And blessed peace to cheer us
[765.00 → 769.92] To keep us in his grace
[769.92 → 774.18] And guide us when we pass
[774.18 → 779.08] And free us from all ills
[779.08 → 784.18] Of this world and the next
[784.18 → 790.08] All praise and thanks to God
[790.08 → 795.58] The Father now be given
[795.58 → 801.08] The soul that in heavy ways
[801.08 → 807.08] With them in the highest heaven
[807.08 → 812.68] Thou one eternal blood
[812.68 → 817.48] Who birth and death will die
[817.48 → 822.28] For thus it was his love
[822.28 → 828.98] And shall be ever more
[828.98 → 832.86] Amen, you may be seated
[832.86 → 839.94] So one of the things
[839.94 → 841.88] That the deacons have organized for us
[841.88 → 845.34] Is to give donations to the food bank
[845.34 → 846.46] We have a strong connection
[846.46 → 847.54] With the Ladder Food Bank
[847.54 → 849.90] Many of our members serve there
[849.90 → 850.68] On Wednesday mornings
[850.68 → 853.14] So may I ask the kids to help out
[853.14 → 854.72] Could I have you kids
[854.72 → 856.44] Come on out
[856.44 → 858.12] And if you are in the pew
[858.12 → 859.66] If you have some food
[859.66 → 861.32] Maybe just kind of raise your hand
[861.32 → 863.80] Wave, and I'd love for you kids
[863.80 → 867.32] To help me by going and getting the food
[867.32 → 868.34] And bringing it up here
[868.34 → 870.58] Okay, all right, go ahead
[891.32 → 894.98] Let's get it up here
[894.98 → 895.62] Thanks
[895.62 → 925.60] Thank you.
[925.62 → 955.60] Thank you.
[955.62 → 985.60] Thank you.
[985.62 → 1015.60] Thank you.
[1015.62 → 1017.62] Thank you.
[1018.24 → 1019.02] All right.
[1019.08 → 1024.26] Isn't that great to see the goodness of God being brought forward by the little ones
[1024.26 → 1028.00] and people sharing and providing for those in need?
[1028.00 → 1034.76] We're going to sing a song that we've been introducing the last little while, if you want to stand.
[1035.48 → 1036.28] Good Shepherd.
[1036.28 → 1049.04] Lord, you are our shepherd.
[1049.04 → 1052.80] We will lack for no good thing.
[1052.80 → 1058.92] For you take us to the pastures that are green.
[1060.52 → 1072.50] You leap inside still waters, bring refreshing to our souls, as you guide us in the paths that made us free.
[1072.50 → 1079.50] Lead on.
[1079.50 → 1080.50] Lead on.
[1080.50 → 1082.50] Lead on.
[1082.50 → 1094.98] Though we walk through death's dark valley, we will fear no evil thing.
[1094.98 → 1101.98] You bring comfort in the presence of our foes.
[1101.98 → 1105.32] You anoint our heads with oil.
[1105.32 → 1115.76] The death and mercy hunt us down as we dwell in your house forevermore.
[1115.76 → 1118.32] Lead on.
[1118.32 → 1120.32] Lead on.
[1120.32 → 1124.32] Lead on.
[1124.32 → 1126.42] Lead on.
[1126.42 → 1128.86] Lead on.
[1128.86 → 1129.98] Lead on.
[1129.98 → 1131.00] Lead on.
[1131.00 → 1133.18] Lord, you are our shepherd.
[1133.76 → 1136.90] We will lack for no good thing.
[1137.32 → 1142.14] For you take us to the pastures that are green.
[1142.14 → 1147.46] You leap beside still waters
[1147.46 → 1151.08] Bring refreshing to our souls
[1151.08 → 1157.14] As you guide us in the paths that made us free
[1157.14 → 1162.40] Lead on
[1162.40 → 1167.14] Lead on
[1172.14 → 1175.58] Though we walk through death's dark valley
[1175.58 → 1179.32] We will fear no evil thing
[1179.32 → 1186.38] You bring comfort in the presence of our foes
[1186.38 → 1191.82] You anoint our heads with royal goodness and mercy
[1191.82 → 1193.36] Hunt us down
[1193.36 → 1200.44] As we dwell in your house forevermore
[1200.44 → 1206.92] Lead on
[1206.92 → 1213.56] Lead on
[1213.56 → 1221.10] Lead on
[1221.10 → 1227.10] Lead on
[1227.10 → 1232.14] You may be seated
[1232.14 → 1240.72] So we continue to worship our Lord
[1240.72 → 1242.48] Through a time of confession
[1242.48 → 1243.88] And assurance
[1243.88 → 1246.86] Because as we lift our praises to God
[1246.86 → 1249.46] We realize that so often in our lives
[1249.46 → 1250.62] We don't praise God
[1250.62 → 1253.50] We don't give him thanks as he is due
[1253.50 → 1256.28] And so we have a time in our worship
[1256.28 → 1258.10] Where we bring our hearts before him
[1258.10 → 1259.26] To seek his cleansing
[1259.26 → 1260.60] To seek his forgiveness
[1260.60 → 1262.30] And to rest
[1262.30 → 1264.48] In the gospel
[1264.48 → 1265.76] The fact that Jesus
[1265.76 → 1267.38] Died for us
[1267.38 → 1269.28] To give us his righteousness
[1269.28 → 1271.46] To forgive us of our sins
[1271.46 → 1273.26] So please pray with me
[1273.26 → 1275.22] As I lead us in a prayer of confession
[1275.22 → 1276.28] Let's bow our heads and pray
[1276.28 → 1278.42] Gracious Father
[1278.42 → 1281.70] You call us in your word
[1281.70 → 1283.08] To rejoice always
[1283.08 → 1285.70] To pray without ceasing
[1285.70 → 1287.80] And to give thanks
[1287.80 → 1289.50] In all circumstances
[1289.50 → 1292.40] Yet we confess
[1292.40 → 1293.14] We pray with you
[1293.14 → 1295.44] That instead of rejoicing
[1295.44 → 1297.70] We doubt your goodness
[1297.70 → 1298.46] In our lives
[1298.46 → 1301.78] Instead of praying without ceasing
[1301.78 → 1304.30] We live in dependence
[1304.30 → 1306.20] On our own devices
[1306.20 → 1307.22] And idols
[1307.22 → 1309.94] And instead of giving thanks
[1309.94 → 1311.06] In all circumstances
[1311.06 → 1312.90] We complain
[1312.90 → 1314.96] And we question your will
[1314.96 → 1315.96] For our lives
[1315.96 → 1317.98] Lord hear
[1317.98 → 1318.88] Our prayer
[1318.88 → 1321.22] And forgive us
[1321.22 → 1322.16] Because of what Christ
[1322.16 → 1323.36] has done for us
[1323.36 → 1324.58] We pray
[1324.58 → 1330.04] And to those
[1330.04 → 1332.14] Who confess their sins
[1332.14 → 1334.34] God is merciful
[1334.34 → 1335.06] And done
[1335.06 → 1337.12] Know that we have often
[1337.12 → 1338.48] strayed from his ways
[1338.48 → 1338.98] And we often
[1338.98 → 1339.58] As we said
[1339.58 → 1340.76] Do not give thanks to him
[1340.76 → 1342.94] He has not removed
[1342.94 → 1344.44] His steadfast love
[1344.44 → 1345.82] From us
[1345.82 → 1348.50] So hear this assurance of pardon
[1348.50 → 1349.84] From Psalm 65
[1349.84 → 1351.28] Verses 3 to 4
[1351.28 → 1354.50] When we were overwhelmed
[1354.50 → 1355.42] By sins
[1355.42 → 1358.42] You forgave our transgressions
[1358.42 → 1361.72] Blessed are those
[1361.72 → 1362.56] You choose
[1362.56 → 1363.72] And bring near
[1363.72 → 1364.96] To live in your court
[1364.96 → 1366.34] We are filled
[1366.34 → 1367.24] With the good things
[1367.24 → 1367.90] Of your house
[1367.90 → 1370.42] Of your holy temple
[1370.42 → 1372.28] Amen
[1372.28 → 1374.40] Please rise with us
[1374.40 → 1375.94] Sing a song
[1375.94 → 1376.38] Well actually
[1376.38 → 1377.02] Not sing these
[1377.02 → 1379.98] We're working with one
[1379.98 → 1381.94] So what we're going to do now
[1381.94 → 1382.96] Is we're going to begin
[1382.96 → 1384.16] By singing
[1384.16 → 1385.52] A very familiar song
[1385.52 → 1386.26] Called gift thanks
[1386.26 → 1388.18] And we're going to sing it
[1388.18 → 1389.02] One time through
[1389.02 → 1390.42] And then we are going to
[1390.42 → 1391.34] Have that time
[1391.34 → 1391.80] I mentioned
[1391.80 → 1393.90] Of sharing our
[1393.90 → 1394.50] Thanksgiving
[1394.50 → 1395.16] To God
[1395.16 → 1396.24] And so
[1396.24 → 1397.86] So we'll sing one time
[1397.86 → 1398.10] Through
[1398.10 → 1398.64] And then please
[1398.64 → 1399.26] Just go ahead
[1399.26 → 1400.10] And step right up
[1400.10 → 1400.70] To the microphone
[1400.70 → 1401.14] Here
[1401.14 → 1402.84] And just say something
[1402.84 → 1404.18] That you're thankful for
[1404.18 → 1405.02] It can be very simple
[1405.02 → 1406.52] The kids can join
[1406.52 → 1407.40] All of you
[1407.40 → 1408.62] It doesn't have to be
[1408.62 → 1409.26] A long testimony
[1409.26 → 1410.34] Just one or two things
[1410.34 → 1411.02] Very simple
[1411.02 → 1411.94] Okay
[1411.94 → 1412.50] Think more like
[1412.50 → 1412.80] 37
[1412.80 → 1414.34] Okay
[1414.34 → 1416.14] And then we will
[1416.14 → 1417.02] Finish that by
[1417.02 → 1417.88] Singing again
[1417.88 → 1418.56] Give thanks
[1418.56 → 1419.08] Okay
[1419.08 → 1419.92] So let's sing
[1419.92 → 1420.66] And then let's
[1420.66 → 1421.42] Begin to rock
[1421.42 → 1440.80] Give thanks
[1440.80 → 1442.96] With a grateful heart
[1442.96 → 1445.36] Give thanks
[1445.36 → 1447.68] To the Holy One
[1447.68 → 1449.80] Give thanks
[1449.80 → 1451.48] Because he's given
[1451.48 → 1456.72] Jesus Christ his Son
[1456.72 → 1459.32] Give thanks
[1459.32 → 1461.36] With a grateful heart
[1461.36 → 1463.78] Give thanks
[1463.78 → 1465.80] To the Holy One
[1465.80 → 1468.10] Give thanks
[1468.10 → 1469.74] Because he's given
[1469.74 → 1475.06] Jesus Christ his Son
[1475.06 → 1476.96] And now
[1476.96 → 1479.34] Let the weak say
[1479.34 → 1481.28] I am strong
[1481.28 → 1483.88] Let the poor say
[1483.88 → 1486.12] I am rich
[1486.12 → 1487.88] Because of what
[1487.88 → 1491.00] The Lord has done
[1491.00 → 1493.18] For us
[1493.18 → 1495.34] And now
[1495.34 → 1497.38] Let the weak say
[1497.38 → 1499.70] I am strong
[1499.70 → 1501.74] Let the poor say
[1501.74 → 1504.02] I am rich
[1504.02 → 1505.66] Because of what
[1505.66 → 1508.82] The Lord has done
[1508.82 → 1511.28] For us
[1511.28 → 1515.74] Give thanks
[1515.74 → 1520.70] Give thanks
[1520.70 → 1523.50] Give thanks

[1551.04 → 1551.08] Good morning
[1551.08 → 1554.08] I am thankful
[1554.08 → 1555.86] For my family
[1555.86 → 1557.80] My friends
[1557.80 → 1560.56] Peter, Kara
[1560.56 → 1563.76] So everyone actually
[1563.76 → 1565.06] So I don't know
[1565.06 → 1567.24] Where to start from
[1567.24 → 1569.92] But I am also thankful
[1569.92 → 1572.74] For everything actually
[1572.74 → 1574.64] God does
[1574.64 → 1575.60] In our family
[1575.60 → 1576.78] And
[1576.78 → 1579.46] Our hearts

[2538.52 → 2539.52] Thank you.
[2539.52 → 2540.52] Thank you.
[2540.52 → 2557.52] I think as a congregation we can be very thankful that the Lord brought Pastor Jason and his family in our midst, and also Pastor Nancy and her family.
[2557.52 → 2560.52] They've been a huge asset here.
[2560.52 → 2563.52] The Lord has worked wonders through them.
[2563.52 → 2566.52] Thank you for all that you do, and God be with you.
[2573.52 → 2580.52] Well, Martin, I was going to charge you for the second time, but since you said what you did, we'll let it go.
[2580.52 → 2584.52] Let's all stand, and let's sing again our song, Give Thanks.
[2593.52 → 2599.52] Give thanks, because He's given Jesus Christ His Son.
[2599.52 → 2617.02] Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his Son.
[2617.02 → 2635.10] Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his Son.
[2635.10 → 2652.90] And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us.
[2652.90 → 2670.74] And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us.
[2670.74 → 2686.42] Give thanks. Give thanks. Give thanks.
[2687.64 → 2688.64] You may be seated.
[2692.62 → 2700.38] Could I have all the kids? Come on up. We're going to do something a little bit different, which is had our children's message now before the Lord's Supper.
[2700.38 → 2703.72] So we'll have the children come down, and then we'll celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[2711.62 → 2712.90] Right here. Right here.
[2713.70 → 2714.80] That was touching.
[2730.38 → 2733.56] All right. Right up front.
[2733.56 → 2734.22] There's space.
[2748.56 → 2749.98] I'm going to talk about that.
[2750.88 → 2752.72] So do you see what I have here?
[2752.72 → 2754.90] What is it?
[2756.08 → 2757.64] It's like wheat bread or white bread?
[2760.94 → 2763.82] White. Well, this is a piece of wheat bread.
[2763.82 → 2773.78] And the reason I'm talking about this is that in a minute we're going to do something called the Lord's Supper.
[2773.98 → 2774.80] Do you guys know that?
[2775.00 → 2777.64] After this, we're going to celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[2777.74 → 2778.92] Can everyone say Lord's Supper?
[2780.02 → 2780.90] Lord's Supper.
[2780.90 → 2786.40] And part of what we do at the Lord's Supper is we take bread, and we break it.
[2786.48 → 2797.84] And the bread represents Jesus' body because Jesus died on the cross to forgive us of our sins so that we can be restored in our relationship with God.
[2799.02 → 2799.46] Yes.
[2800.96 → 2802.02] You do. Good.
[2802.96 → 2804.60] I think you pay attention to Sunday school, right?
[2804.60 → 2807.10] Yeah, I think you're a good student.
[2807.74 → 2810.62] So now this is called the Lord's Supper.
[2811.18 → 2813.46] It's also called, who knows another name for it?
[2814.44 → 2818.62] It's called communion because we have communion with God.
[2818.72 → 2822.46] But the third name I want to talk about is called Eucharist.
[2822.86 → 2823.60] That's a hard word.
[2823.66 → 2824.92] Can everyone say Eucharist?
[2826.20 → 2826.76] Eucharist.
[2827.28 → 2827.84] Right.
[2828.04 → 2834.08] Eucharist is a Greek word because the Bible in the New Testament, it was written originally in Greek.
[2834.08 → 2835.10] Did you know that?
[2835.98 → 2840.14] It was translated into English and Chinese and other languages, but it was originally in Greek.
[2840.64 → 2843.74] And the word Eucharist, do you know what it means?
[2844.92 → 2847.02] It means to give thanks.
[2847.88 → 2848.28] Do you know that?
[2848.34 → 2857.02] So in Jesus, he took the bread, and he broke it, and he gave thanks.
[2857.70 → 2858.22] Eucharist.
[2858.70 → 2859.54] Okay, so he gave thanks.
[2859.54 → 2862.54] So we call this meal the Eucharist, which means what?
[2863.90 → 2864.34] Thanksgiving.
[2865.08 → 2865.52] Thanksgiving.
[2865.88 → 2866.90] So today is Thanksgiving.
[2867.10 → 2867.58] Do you know that?
[2868.28 → 2869.24] Well, tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[2869.40 → 2870.42] This is Thanksgiving Sunday.
[2871.48 → 2876.82] And so what we're going to celebrate in a moment is called a Thanksgiving meal.
[2876.82 → 2886.96] So Jesus broke the bread, and he gave thanks to God for his sacrifice that he was about to do so that we can become his children.
[2887.48 → 2897.32] And then we, in turn, we give thanks to God for giving us his son Jesus to die in our place and so that we could be called children of God.
[2897.32 → 2903.88] Okay, so when we're about to take this meal, I want you to remember it's a meal of Thanksgiving.
[2904.56 → 2905.48] Okay, Eucharist.
[2906.12 → 2907.02] Okay, can you remember that?
[2907.80 → 2908.38] All right.
[2909.04 → 2909.58] Good job.
[2909.84 → 2910.50] Thanks for listening.
[2911.44 → 2912.32] Okay, one thing.
[2921.10 → 2921.46] Yeah.
[2922.40 → 2922.78] Right.
[2925.10 → 2925.42] Yeah.
[2925.42 → 2925.48] Yeah.
[2927.68 → 2928.30] That's good.
[2928.48 → 2929.04] That's very good.
[2929.48 → 2929.74] All right.
[2929.80 → 2930.96] So we're going to break bread together.
[2931.12 → 2935.88] And when we eat it in your hearts, I want you to feel thankful to God for giving us Jesus.
[2936.04 → 2936.18] Okay?
[2936.56 → 2936.98] All right.
[2937.04 → 2940.44] Go back to your seats and let's get ready to celebrate the Lord's Supper together.
[2940.74 → 2941.20] Go ahead.
[2946.68 → 2947.12] All right.
[2947.18 → 2947.66] Go on back.
[2948.06 → 2948.52] Thank you.
[2948.52 → 2948.54] Thank you.
[2948.54 → 2948.60] Thank you.
[2948.60 → 2949.14] Thank you.
[2949.14 → 2949.54] Thank you.
[2949.54 → 2950.60] Thank you.
[2950.60 → 2951.54] Thank you.
[2951.54 → 2952.54] Thank you.
[2952.54 → 2952.60] Thank you.
[2957.32 → 2961.98] All right.
[2961.98 → 2969.00] So as I just mentioned, we are going to celebrate the Lord's Supper or the what?
[2970.26 → 2970.78] Eucharist.
[2971.98 → 2972.94] So that's okay.
[2973.02 → 2975.08] We can say Eucharist, which means Thanksgiving.
[2975.08 → 2980.72] And so because we're celebrating the Eucharist or the great Thanksgiving, we're going to use
[2980.72 → 2984.14] a liturgy, a traditional liturgy called the great Thanksgiving.
[2984.62 → 2986.28] So we're going to have some words on the screen.
[2986.94 → 2990.28] And please say it responsibly with me.
[2990.28 → 2992.48] The Lord be with you.
[2992.48 → 2994.00] And also with you.
[2995.38 → 2995.90] Hearts.
[2996.38 → 2997.64] Give it to the Lord.
[2998.70 → 3001.30] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[3001.78 → 3004.98] It is right for us to give thanks and praise.
[3005.48 → 3012.78] It is right and good and a joyful thing that we should at all times and in all places give
[3012.78 → 3018.82] thanks unto you, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God.
[3018.82 → 3026.26] Therefore, with angels and archangels and with all the company of heaven, we laud and magnify
[3026.26 → 3034.96] your glorious name forevermore praising you and saying together, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
[3034.96 → 3039.96] God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.
[3040.76 → 3044.28] Glory be to you, O Lord most high.
[3044.28 → 3048.70] For in the night in which he was betrayed, Jesus took bread.
[3049.18 → 3055.90] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples saying, Take, eat.
[3056.36 → 3059.04] This is my body, which is given for you.
[3059.74 → 3061.46] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3062.76 → 3064.92] Likewise, after supper, he took the cup.
[3064.92 → 3070.98] And when he had given thanks, he gave it to them saying, This is the blood of the new covenant,
[3071.82 → 3076.98] which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins.
[3077.62 → 3081.60] Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[3083.28 → 3086.04] Therefore, together we proclaim the mystery of faith.
[3086.04 → 3088.14] Christ has died.
[3088.68 → 3089.66] Christ is risen.
[3090.38 → 3091.82] Christ will come again.
[3092.70 → 3095.02] The gifts of God for the people of God.
[3095.70 → 3098.08] Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you.
[3098.60 → 3102.88] And feed on him in your hearts by faith and with what?
[3103.78 → 3104.34] Thanksgiving.
[3105.24 → 3111.18] Could I ask our elders and deacons who are serving to come forward to help me distribute the elements.

[3846.34 → 3848.08] when I brought them out of Egypt.
[3848.72 → 3851.20] I am the Lord your God.
[3851.68 → 3853.04] This is the word of the Lord.
[3854.82 → 3855.74] Let's pray.
[3857.10 → 3861.96] Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning for your word,
[3861.96 → 3867.68] which is absolutely true, inspired by the Holy Spirit,
[3868.04 → 3870.08] and you give it to us because you love us.
[3870.86 → 3872.88] And so help us to love you in turn
[3872.88 → 3875.72] through the preaching and hearing of your word.
[3876.42 → 3878.34] And Lord, would you apply it to our lives
[3878.34 → 3881.30] for the sake of your Son, in whose name we pray.
[3881.88 → 3882.20] Amen.
[3884.42 → 3887.08] So picture this scene.
[3887.68 → 3889.34] And then here's a painting to help us picture it.
[3889.34 → 3894.92] It's the fall of 1621.
[3896.00 → 3900.62] You have survived nearly a year in the New World.
[3901.62 → 3903.54] England is far behind you.
[3904.36 → 3909.24] And now you have the freedom to worship as Puritans in America.
[3910.42 → 3912.90] The first few months were hard.
[3913.80 → 3917.72] Nearly half of your friends and family died over the winter
[3917.72 → 3920.82] from exposure, scurvy, and other diseases.
[3922.02 → 3924.88] But you are one of the ones who survived.
[3926.34 → 3929.20] And since the spring, you have been helped and cared for
[3929.20 → 3932.12] by some of the indigenous peoples, the Wampanoags.
[3932.12 → 3939.76] And now, as the fall harvest comes in, it's time for a great feast.
[3940.66 → 3944.78] And so the pilgrims and the Native Americans gather together
[3944.78 → 3950.02] and side by side celebrate what today we call the first Thanksgiving.
[3950.02 → 3954.86] Now, this is the beginning and end of the story,
[3954.92 → 3958.26] as I learned it in school as a boy growing up in the United States.
[3959.50 → 3964.86] But something I learned recently is that this first Thanksgiving
[3964.86 → 3969.06] actually has strong connections to the Feast of Tabernacles.
[3969.64 → 3971.48] And I think it will interest you to know
[3971.48 → 3974.22] it has a connection to the Netherlands.
[3974.22 → 3975.46] Whoa.
[3976.28 → 3977.66] So let me explain.
[3978.86 → 3983.58] Before coming to America, the English Puritans spent a decade where?
[3984.84 → 3985.44] Holland.
[3986.56 → 3990.32] Because of the relative religious tolerance there.
[3990.78 → 3993.72] And they lived with and among the Jewish people
[3993.72 → 3997.06] who were also there for the same reason, the religious tolerance.
[3997.22 → 4000.20] They had been kicked out of England in the 1200s.
[4000.80 → 4001.66] 1200s, yeah.
[4001.66 → 4004.96] So anyway, the Jews are there, the Puritans are there
[4004.96 → 4006.22] who don't want to read the prayer book,
[4006.26 → 4007.46] and they want to worship on their own.
[4009.82 → 4013.30] And during that time, the Puritans got to know their Jewish friends.
[4014.04 → 4015.78] They grew to respect them.
[4016.26 → 4020.44] They watched their celebrations and their festivals.
[4021.50 → 4024.76] And later, these same Puritans would then sail
[4024.76 → 4027.50] to what they called New England.
[4027.50 → 4031.68] And while the pilgrims probably wouldn't have viewed that first Thanksgiving
[4031.68 → 4036.00] as a direct continuation of the Feast of Tabernacles,
[4036.50 → 4039.32] there are some intriguing similarities.
[4040.24 → 4043.26] Both of these celebrations happened in the fall.
[4043.80 → 4047.26] They both celebrate the harvest and give thanks to God's provision.
[4048.38 → 4050.40] And both of these celebrations,
[4050.90 → 4053.04] they celebrate freedom from oppression.
[4053.04 → 4055.80] The Israelites from slavery in Egypt
[4055.80 → 4061.34] and the pilgrims from what they called religious persecution in England.
[4062.34 → 4065.42] And so just as the Israelites celebrated their Thanksgiving,
[4065.72 → 4069.44] their harvest festival called the Feast of Tabernacles,
[4070.14 → 4073.72] perhaps that was in the minds of those pilgrims
[4073.72 → 4076.44] as they celebrated their first Thanksgiving
[4076.44 → 4079.94] and what they saw as their promised land.
[4079.94 → 4085.70] And so today, we celebrate our Thanksgiving holiday
[4085.70 → 4088.82] and we give thanks to God for the very same reasons
[4088.82 → 4093.40] that those pilgrims did and our Jewish ancestors before us.
[4094.76 → 4096.96] And so here's our outline for this morning.
[4097.96 → 4103.00] The Feast of Tabernacles shows us two great reasons to thank God.
[4103.48 → 4105.36] Two great reasons to thank God.
[4105.62 → 4108.06] We give thanks to God for his ongoing provision
[4108.06 → 4112.74] and we give thanks to God for his redemption,
[4113.32 → 4114.86] sometimes called salvation.
[4115.54 → 4117.24] And we're going to look briefly at these two
[4117.24 → 4121.78] and then I'd love to consider how we in our lives can give thanks to God.
[4122.50 → 4126.50] So first, let's look at these two reasons for Thanksgiving briefly.
[4127.06 → 4132.98] First, the Feast of Tabernacles was a time to rejoice in God's provision.
[4133.86 → 4135.08] God created the world.
[4135.08 → 4143.20] He created everything in it, and he made us to be his image bearers in the world he made.
[4143.94 → 4148.40] But God didn't create all of this and then just leave us and go away somewhere.
[4149.46 → 4152.74] No, God continues to care for us.
[4153.26 → 4158.60] He continues to providentially care for his creation,
[4158.70 → 4159.78] for all that he has made.
[4159.78 → 4164.28] So let's take a look at our passage again, verse 39.
[4165.74 → 4168.40] So beginning with the 15th day of the seventh month,
[4168.82 → 4170.76] after you have gathered the crops of the land,
[4171.14 → 4173.96] celebrate the festival to the Lord for seven days.
[4174.38 → 4177.82] The first day is a day of rest and the eighth day also is a day of rest.
[4178.30 → 4179.48] So notice what it says.
[4179.94 → 4182.58] After you have gathered the crops of the land,
[4182.58 → 4186.70] this festival came at the end of the olive and grape harvest.
[4187.34 → 4189.32] So it was a harvest festival.
[4189.74 → 4193.62] And it marked the completion of the annual agricultural cycle.
[4195.08 → 4197.74] And what did they do during this festival?
[4198.42 → 4204.08] Well, our text says that this festival is book ended by Sabbath rest.
[4204.08 → 4213.06] And as I was thinking about that, the older I get, the more I like this idea of rest.
[4213.38 → 4215.90] Having a holiday to just rest.
[4216.26 → 4217.00] So that's great.
[4217.64 → 4219.26] But what else did they do?
[4220.20 → 4221.98] It says they celebrated.
[4222.40 → 4224.32] They celebrated a whole week.
[4225.04 → 4226.80] You know, we have Thanksgiving one day, right?
[4227.28 → 4230.82] Maybe if you have one side of the family or the other, you get two days.
[4230.96 → 4232.48] One meal on Sunday, one meal on Monday.
[4232.48 → 4237.18] They celebrated for six whole days, a whole week of feasting,
[4237.50 → 4242.66] full of food and joy and thankfulness and procession and celebration.
[4243.54 → 4246.42] It was a festival of Thanksgiving to the Lord.
[4247.12 → 4252.28] And at least part of this thankfulness would be focused on the provision of the land.
[4252.76 → 4258.24] It was a celebration of the blessings that God has given through the crops.
[4259.32 → 4260.70] Okay, so now let's look at verse 40.
[4260.70 → 4270.32] On the first day, you are to take choice fruit from the trees, palm fronds, leafy branches, and poplars,
[4270.64 → 4274.24] and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.
[4274.94 → 4282.46] Now what is interesting about this to me is that you take what our Jewish friends called the four species.
[4282.46 → 4291.52] You take fruit of the trees, palm fronds, and palm fronds, and leafy boughs, and branches of a poplar or willow tree,
[4291.84 → 4297.76] and you bring them before the Lord, and then it says you rejoice before the Lord.
[4297.76 → 4307.50] Now when the text says on the first day you are to take choice fruit from the trees, let me ask you,
[4308.14 → 4310.16] does that sound familiar?
[4311.52 → 4311.76] Right?
[4311.76 → 4314.62] Where have we heard something like that before?
[4315.50 → 4321.10] Well, of course, if you think about the picking of fruit, you've got to go to the first time,
[4321.18 → 4325.72] the one of only very few references, to when fruit was picked.
[4326.50 → 4329.22] And that, of course, is Genesis chapter 3.
[4330.06 → 4331.18] You know the story.
[4331.18 → 4334.02] The Lord God had created the heavens and the earth.
[4334.58 → 4340.54] And then the Lord God made all the vegetation, all the living creatures, the birds of the air,
[4340.70 → 4343.34] the fish of the sea, the animals on land.
[4343.76 → 4347.70] And then he made us in his image to be his image bearers in his garden temple.
[4348.62 → 4350.98] And then we come to Genesis chapter 3.
[4351.34 → 4358.12] And God told the man and the woman that they are free to eat the fruit of every tree in the garden
[4358.12 → 4361.18] except for one tree.
[4362.12 → 4363.94] God gave them a beautiful garden.
[4364.28 → 4365.78] God gave them beautiful fruit.
[4366.58 → 4368.82] One tree he did not give.
[4369.78 → 4370.84] And you know what happens.
[4371.30 → 4377.16] The woman and the man, they take the fruit from that one tree that God did not give them.
[4379.42 → 4381.94] But when they pick the fruit in Genesis 3,
[4382.82 → 4388.04] you have a very different outcome than when they pick the fruit in Leviticus 23.
[4388.12 → 4388.44] Okay?
[4389.78 → 4393.14] So Leviticus 23, you have the picking of the fruit.
[4393.78 → 4396.22] And you have rejoicing before God.
[4396.42 → 4396.58] Right?
[4396.64 → 4397.24] Did you notice that?
[4397.48 → 4399.74] They pick the fruit, rejoice before the Lord.
[4400.26 → 4407.04] But in Genesis 3, you have the picking of the fruit, an alienation from God.
[4407.96 → 4408.18] Right?
[4408.24 → 4413.50] The picking leads not to rejoicing, but that picking leads to sadness.
[4413.50 → 4418.58] And this sadness, it was not only in our relationship with God,
[4418.64 → 4422.06] but that sadness began to come into every area of their lives.
[4423.14 → 4429.92] So in Genesis 3.16, we're told that the sadness, that in sadness, the woman would bear children.
[4429.92 → 4435.76] And then in Genesis 3.17, God says,
[4435.90 → 4438.24] In sadness you will eat of the cursed ground.
[4439.44 → 4443.16] And so in Genesis, the sadness spreads to all of their fruitfulness.
[4444.02 → 4446.88] Whatever fruitfulness the man can bring from the ground,
[4447.00 → 4449.18] whatever fruitfulness the woman can bring from the womb,
[4449.44 → 4451.82] it all comes in sadness.
[4451.82 → 4455.68] So the question is, well, what's the difference?
[4456.44 → 4459.30] Why does the picking of fruit in Genesis result in sadness?
[4460.30 → 4462.82] Well, the picking of fruit in Leviticus leads to rejoicing.
[4464.30 → 4469.04] Well, in Genesis 3, by eating the fruit, what happened?
[4469.22 → 4470.84] Well, they were disobeying God, right?
[4471.48 → 4477.62] But more than that, they didn't take the fruit as a gift from God.
[4478.26 → 4480.70] They took it for themselves.
[4480.70 → 4484.86] They took it from, not from the hands of God who gave them all things generously,
[4485.48 → 4489.76] but they took it in a sense of pride and self-sufficiency.
[4491.36 → 4495.26] But in Leviticus 23, what happens?
[4495.70 → 4499.60] God comes to them, and he says, okay, listen, the harvest is done.
[4500.64 → 4502.96] And you're going to have a harvest festival.
[4503.30 → 4504.10] It's going to be great.
[4504.84 → 4507.82] This is after you've done all of this work, right?
[4507.86 → 4508.64] You've done all this work.
[4508.64 → 4510.66] You've prepared the fields.
[4511.46 → 4513.38] You have seeded the fields.
[4513.92 → 4515.54] You have cultivated the fields.
[4515.76 → 4517.52] You have harvested the fields.
[4518.32 → 4520.40] And you have done so much work.
[4521.06 → 4523.24] And then God says, at the end of all of this work,
[4523.46 → 4527.60] what I'd like you to do is go and pick some fruit.
[4527.60 → 4529.78] But don't stop there.
[4530.42 → 4532.80] Then pick the leafy branches.
[4533.20 → 4534.68] And then pick the bough of the tree.
[4534.88 → 4542.76] And then take a branch of the tree and before me hold all of these things and rejoice before me.
[4542.76 → 4545.00] Why?
[4545.00 → 4545.08] Why?
[4546.08 → 4549.48] To recognize that it all came from the hand of God.
[4550.34 → 4556.26] Right beneath all of that human work and all that ingenuity was God's creation and God's provision.
[4556.88 → 4557.00] Right?
[4557.06 → 4562.18] Things that we did not make, but that were given to us.
[4562.18 → 4570.16] And so this picture is of arms that are so, so full of good things that you can barely hold on to it.
[4571.34 → 4573.52] And God gave all of this fruitfulness.
[4573.52 → 4580.04] So pick and take and take and fill up your arms and come before me, God says, and rejoice.
[4581.52 → 4587.26] God told the people to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles so that they would rejoice before him
[4587.26 → 4593.70] and recognize that it is God who cares for them and that he continues to care for them.
[4594.66 → 4599.54] So brothers and sisters, let us praise and thank God for his provision.
[4599.54 → 4606.62] Now secondly, the Feast of Tabernacles was not only a time to thank God for his provision,
[4606.76 → 4609.28] but also to remember God's redemption.
[4610.24 → 4612.32] It was a time to remember God's redemption.
[4613.24 → 4613.36] Right?
[4613.44 → 4618.62] And when we are under a crushing slavery, and there are so many forms of slavery,
[4619.18 → 4621.42] it is God who sets us free.
[4622.42 → 4625.20] So let's take a look at verse 42 in our passage.
[4625.68 → 4629.16] It says, God says, live in booths for seven days.
[4629.54 → 4632.52] All native-born Israelites are to live in booths.
[4633.02 → 4636.70] So your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in booths
[4636.70 → 4638.40] when I brought them out of Egypt.
[4638.70 → 4640.12] I am the Lord your God.
[4641.74 → 4645.46] So part of how the Israelites were to celebrate this Feast of Tabernacles,
[4646.06 → 4648.90] or as it's sometimes called the Feast of Booths,
[4649.76 → 4653.48] is that they were to build these booths outside their homes,
[4653.64 → 4655.98] and they were to live there for seven days.
[4656.72 → 4657.70] So imagine this.
[4658.36 → 4660.84] Maybe, I think we sent all the children away,
[4660.98 → 4664.64] but if there are some children, John, I see you.
[4664.84 → 4664.94] Okay.
[4668.94 → 4670.30] Sorry, that totally got me off track.
[4671.16 → 4673.98] So think about, and you adults too, we all love camping.
[4674.10 → 4674.94] Okay, think about camping.
[4674.94 → 4680.58] It's like setting up a tent and going camping with your family,
[4681.06 → 4684.44] except for you don't get one of those tents where you just, like,
[4684.48 → 4685.44] pop it up real quick.
[4685.86 → 4687.46] Oh, yeah, a lot of you guys have trailers, right?
[4688.20 → 4690.82] Campers, okay, you just bring your house with you.
[4691.64 → 4693.42] So that's one level.
[4693.58 → 4695.60] And then there's, like, tenting, which is what I do.
[4695.92 → 4697.62] And that's pretty easy, though.
[4697.62 → 4698.90] You set up a tent, you're good to go.
[4698.90 → 4706.16] They had to build their own shelter with tree branches and leafy boughs.
[4706.92 → 4712.48] And the tradition gives us a little more information on exactly how these tents were to look.
[4713.24 → 4718.00] They were supposed to be big enough to fit your entire family,
[4718.64 → 4722.92] to be able to sit together at a table to read scripture and pray and to feast.
[4722.92 → 4727.18] So this is a substantial booth.
[4727.66 → 4730.92] And it better not fall on grandmother or the kids or anything.
[4731.10 → 4731.68] It's got to be good.
[4732.22 → 4734.56] It had to be sturdy enough to withstand the wind.
[4735.14 → 4740.30] And there were to be some gaps in the ceiling so that you can see the stars.
[4741.96 → 4747.60] And what is meant by all of this is that the tents would serve their purpose,
[4748.38 → 4751.08] but they wouldn't be permanent or luxurious.
[4751.08 → 4754.76] Instead, they were meant to be temporary and fragile.
[4755.94 → 4757.76] Now, why did God ask them to do this?
[4757.78 → 4758.94] This is kind of a weird festival.
[4759.46 → 4765.04] Like, why did he make them take branches and build tents and do this?
[4765.08 → 4766.14] And the text tells us.
[4766.48 → 4766.76] It says,
[4766.88 → 4773.42] So your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in boughs when I brought them out of Egypt.
[4773.42 → 4773.70] Right?
[4774.36 → 4778.14] After the Israelites settled in the promised land,
[4778.88 → 4781.74] right, a land blessed beyond measure,
[4781.96 → 4784.00] a land flowing with milk and honey,
[4784.68 → 4787.72] and after they had built permanent houses to live in,
[4788.32 → 4794.42] it would be all too easy to forget that it was the Lord who led them out of slavery in Egypt.
[4794.42 → 4799.44] It would be all too easy to forget that it is God who provided for them in the wilderness.
[4800.78 → 4805.56] In this promised land, especially in the generations to come,
[4805.84 → 4809.58] the people would forget what it meant to depend on God.
[4810.62 → 4813.98] They would begin to assume that the food that they grow,
[4814.06 → 4815.20] the houses that they live in,
[4815.26 → 4818.46] the security they enjoyed were the result of their own labour,
[4819.16 → 4821.60] rather than from the hands of a generous God.
[4821.60 → 4824.64] So once a year, for a week,
[4825.06 → 4826.00] God says,
[4826.56 → 4828.22] Leave your houses,
[4829.58 → 4830.74] build a booth,
[4832.02 → 4832.84] and dwell in it.
[4833.76 → 4836.20] And remember where you came from.
[4837.44 → 4839.48] They were to remember the grace of God
[4839.48 → 4841.16] that brought them out of Egypt.
[4842.28 → 4844.00] They were to remember the mercy of God
[4844.00 → 4846.56] that preserved their lives in the wilderness,
[4847.54 → 4850.22] even when they sinned against him again and again.
[4850.22 → 4854.38] And the grace of God that brought them into the promised land.
[4855.26 → 4856.90] So that's the Feast of Tabernacles.
[4857.52 → 4860.42] It gives us two great reasons to thank God.
[4860.64 → 4862.28] We thank him for his ongoing provision,
[4862.68 → 4865.24] and we thank him for his great redemption.
[4866.60 → 4867.58] And as God's people,
[4868.10 → 4869.98] we need these reminders, don't we?
[4870.98 → 4871.16] Right?
[4871.28 → 4872.56] Thousands of years ago,
[4872.64 → 4873.28] for God's people,
[4873.36 → 4874.22] they had the Feast of Tabernacles,
[4875.14 → 4876.14] where God said,
[4876.50 → 4877.54] Get out of your comfortable houses,
[4877.54 → 4878.48] go live in a tent,
[4878.56 → 4879.80] and remember my salvation.
[4880.58 → 4883.22] Hold this armful of the bounty of the land
[4883.22 → 4884.34] and remember my provision.
[4885.50 → 4886.00] Now today,
[4886.08 → 4888.46] we don't have an exact equivalent for Christians,
[4889.10 → 4891.28] but we do have this holiday of Thanksgiving,
[4891.50 → 4891.82] don't we?
[4892.96 → 4894.62] And this can help us,
[4894.88 → 4895.78] help remind us
[4895.78 → 4899.02] that we also have these two great reasons to thank God.
[4899.70 → 4901.26] So I just want to take a moment,
[4901.36 → 4902.14] as we conclude,
[4902.26 → 4904.84] to think about how we can be thankful to God.
[4904.84 → 4907.20] And the first is,
[4907.66 → 4909.86] let us rejoice and be grateful for God's provision.
[4911.70 → 4913.36] Now, I don't know about you,
[4913.76 → 4916.14] but I often have trouble thanking God.
[4916.96 → 4918.42] Anybody have trouble thanking God?
[4918.64 → 4919.26] I do.
[4920.32 → 4922.66] And this is because of all sorts of obstacles
[4922.66 → 4925.66] and blockages in my heart,
[4925.74 → 4926.60] which get in the way.
[4927.44 → 4929.00] And there are many different kinds of obstacles.
[4929.92 → 4933.24] And it is worth your time to identify what yours might be.
[4933.24 → 4936.32] I'm just going to mention two personal ones
[4936.32 → 4939.54] and one that I think we see in our culture around us.
[4940.58 → 4943.50] So my first personal obstacle to being thankful
[4943.50 → 4946.70] is I tend to notice much more easily
[4946.70 → 4948.20] when I lack something.
[4949.44 → 4949.66] Right?
[4949.70 → 4952.64] When there's something I want me to don't have,
[4952.96 → 4955.26] that's often what I spend my time thinking about.
[4955.98 → 4956.74] And of course,
[4956.78 → 4957.70] it's hard to be thankful
[4957.70 → 4960.22] when I'm focused on my lack
[4960.22 → 4962.64] instead of on what I have.
[4964.60 → 4966.32] Now, my second personal obstacle
[4966.32 → 4970.36] is that when I am thankful for what I have,
[4971.10 → 4972.80] I still often forget to thank God.
[4973.64 → 4974.98] And it's easy for me, you know,
[4975.02 → 4977.62] to enjoy so much of the goodness of life,
[4977.76 → 4980.70] to have all of this good fruit that God gives me,
[4980.98 → 4981.66] and to think,
[4981.66 → 4983.14] I worked hard for this,
[4983.76 → 4985.32] or I deserve this,
[4985.82 → 4986.68] or look at me.
[4987.30 → 4989.32] And I fail to recognize that actually
[4989.32 → 4991.08] it comes from God's generosity.
[4993.14 → 4993.32] Right?
[4993.36 → 4995.16] So those are two personal obstacles
[4995.16 → 4996.46] to gratitude for me.
[4996.70 → 4999.32] I tend to notice more what I don't have,
[5000.16 → 5002.12] and I take credit for what I do have.
[5003.22 → 5005.78] Maybe you can relate to one or both of those.
[5005.78 → 5009.20] Now, here is the cultural obstacle.
[5010.66 → 5012.92] As we humans find ourselves
[5012.92 → 5016.08] able to explain the processes of nature,
[5017.02 → 5018.84] we can explain, ask Bart,
[5019.04 → 5020.14] how trees grow.
[5020.86 → 5024.48] We can explain how the crops grow from the field,
[5024.62 → 5025.68] how clouds are formed,
[5025.78 → 5026.88] how the mountains are formed.
[5028.06 → 5029.84] As we're able to explain these things,
[5029.90 → 5032.02] we find it difficult to thank God for them.
[5032.02 → 5036.26] We assume, if we're not thinking carefully,
[5036.70 → 5040.22] that God dwells in the mysteries of creation.
[5041.04 → 5043.30] And so whenever a mystery is explained,
[5043.84 → 5046.52] we feel that God must have left the room.
[5048.00 → 5049.00] Now, let's be honest,
[5049.46 → 5051.98] there is still a great deal that we do not know.
[5052.92 → 5056.04] And often, the more we discover,
[5056.78 → 5059.88] we're more aware of actually our ignorance.
[5059.88 → 5062.72] But in our culture today,
[5062.84 → 5064.30] even among us Christians,
[5064.86 → 5066.16] we have a real suspicion
[5066.16 → 5068.10] that the more we know,
[5068.20 → 5069.82] the less there is to thank God for.
[5071.20 → 5072.94] If we can predict the rain,
[5073.16 → 5075.48] if we can fertilize and irrigate the fields,
[5076.10 → 5077.68] we have trouble thanking God for it.
[5079.10 → 5080.92] And maybe you have felt this suspicion
[5080.92 → 5082.30] in your own heart as well.
[5084.14 → 5086.36] But friends, we have many reasons to thank God
[5086.36 → 5089.10] for his generous provision.
[5089.10 → 5091.94] And something that struck me in this passage
[5091.94 → 5094.14] is that we are actually encouraged
[5094.14 → 5096.50] to take pleasure in God's good gifts.
[5097.70 → 5098.02] Right?
[5098.06 → 5101.14] We are encouraged to be joyful before God.
[5101.56 → 5101.72] Right?
[5102.04 → 5105.94] It's not sinful to enjoy good food.
[5106.52 → 5108.60] It is not sinful to celebrate.
[5109.74 → 5111.82] The issue comes up when the gifts
[5111.82 → 5115.34] begin to eclipse the giver in our hearts.
[5115.34 → 5120.54] Lastly, let us praise and thank God
[5120.54 → 5121.40] for our redemption.
[5122.30 → 5124.68] Friends, when you and I have been saved from something,
[5124.98 → 5127.68] it is right to thank the one who saved you.
[5129.14 → 5131.90] The Feast of Tabernacles reminded the Israelites
[5131.90 → 5134.64] of their salvation from slavery in Egypt.
[5135.30 → 5136.02] But you know what?
[5136.06 → 5138.66] We too were in slavery.
[5138.66 → 5141.98] Not to Pharaoh in Egypt,
[5142.64 → 5145.22] but to sin and death and the devil.
[5146.20 → 5147.98] And just as the awesome might of God
[5147.98 → 5149.36] freed his people from Egypt,
[5149.54 → 5152.22] so did this awesome sacrifice of Christ
[5152.22 → 5153.42] make us free.
[5154.76 → 5156.56] And while the freedom from Egypt
[5156.56 → 5158.34] was for the Israelites alone,
[5159.00 → 5161.40] the freedom from sin is for all.
[5162.14 → 5164.84] Each and every person who calls upon the name of the Lord
[5164.84 → 5166.14] will be saved.
[5166.92 → 5167.90] Thanks be to God.
[5168.78 → 5169.64] Let's pray together.
[5172.70 → 5174.96] Father, you are our redeemer.
[5175.96 → 5177.54] You are our creator.
[5178.46 → 5179.78] You are our provider.
[5180.72 → 5182.96] Thank you for your patience with us.
[5183.76 → 5185.32] We thank you for your love for us.
[5185.38 → 5187.14] We thank you for your generosity
[5187.14 → 5191.28] that extends so much further
[5191.28 → 5193.82] than what we deserve
[5193.82 → 5195.74] and what we even expect.
[5196.82 → 5197.72] Help us, O Lord,
[5197.78 → 5200.54] to remember that you are the source of all things
[5200.54 → 5202.94] and to rejoice before you.
[5203.58 → 5205.26] We pray all of this to you
[5205.26 → 5206.60] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[5207.02 → 5208.52] who is our King and our Saviour.
[5209.42 → 5209.72] Amen.
[5212.04 → 5212.76] Let's stand.
[5213.12 → 5214.44] Let's sing our song of response.
[5217.14 → 5240.90] Great is thy faithfulness,
[5240.90 → 5243.82] O Lord, my Father.
[5243.82 → 5271.38] Great is thy faithfulness,
[5271.38 → 5275.20] Great is thy faithfulness,
[5275.72 → 5278.20] Morning by morning,
[5278.64 → 5281.58] New mercies I see.
[5282.96 → 5285.94] All I have needed,
[5285.94 → 5289.36] Thy hand has provided.
[5290.92 → 5294.90] Great is thy faithfulness,
[5294.90 → 5298.26] Lord, unto me.
[5298.26 → 5300.24] Hor bolt by this.
[5300.46 → 5302.36] Hard and forcing
[5302.36 → 5303.96] And to grasp
[5303.96 → 5304.96] Esperanto
[5304.96 → 5306.30] Learn who's
[5306.30 → 5307.22] There,
[5307.22 → 5307.60] There,
[5307.60 → 5308.86] Not a fire
[5308.86 → 5310.62] On Mars,
[5310.70 → 5311.86] In other.
[5311.86 → 5312.26] For them
[5312.26 → 5313.34] Your praise
[5313.34 → 5313.76] Thank the assist
[5313.76 → 5315.04] Our sparks
[5315.04 → 5315.26] And Spirit
[5315.80 → 5316.48] with all
[5316.48 → 5317.98] lit
[5317.98 → 5318.02] There,
[5323.02 → 5324.66] To thy brave
[5324.66 → 5325.72] Faithfulness,
[5325.72 → 5329.94] The rest of us, mercy and love.
[5331.02 → 5334.66] Great is thy fifth class.
[5335.12 → 5338.70] Great is thy fifth class.
[5339.10 → 5344.72] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[5346.08 → 5352.36] All I have needed thy hand has provided.
[5352.36 → 5361.70] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[5363.60 → 5370.68] Harden for sin and every school day to hell.
[5371.42 → 5377.36] But with presence to chief and to guide.
[5377.36 → 5385.70] Strengthen today and light the glory of God.
[5386.20 → 5392.36] Let me tell my with ten thousand beside.
[5394.42 → 5397.36] Great is thy faithfulness.
[5398.52 → 5401.36] Great is thy faithfulness.
[5401.36 → 5409.54] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[5410.32 → 5417.28] All I have needed thy hand has provided.
[5417.28 → 5422.62] Great is thy faithfulness.
[5422.62 → 5423.62] Great is thy faithfulness.
[5423.62 → 5427.62] Lord, unto me.
[5431.62 → 5432.26] Amen.
[5432.52 → 5433.18] You may be seated.
[5433.18 → 5433.32] Amen.
[5439.52 → 5448.98] So we recognize that, again, everything comes from God, from our Father who gives us all things graciously.
[5449.14 → 5455.96] So one way that we can have thankfulness in our hearts and express it is to give back to God a portion of what he gives to us.
[5455.96 → 5460.14] And so we continue to worship the Lord by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[5460.14 → 5463.46] Our designated offering for today is for World Renew.
[5463.56 → 5466.12] It's one of the ministries of the Christian Reformed Church.
[5466.60 → 5470.86] And specifically for their Free of Family initiative.
[5470.86 → 5494.72] Thank you very much.
[5494.72 → 5496.72] Amen.
[5524.72 → 5526.72] Amen.
[5554.72 → 5556.72] Amen.
[5584.72 → 5586.72] Amen.
[5614.72 → 5616.72] Amen.
[5644.72 → 5646.72] Amen.
[5674.72 → 5676.72] Amen.
[5704.72 → 5705.72] Amen.
[5705.72 → 5707.72] That was beautiful.
[5707.72 → 5714.12] Let's go before the Lord in prayer, and we'll pray for some of the needs in our church and
[5714.12 → 5716.62] let's pray for the world as well.
[5716.62 → 5717.62] Please pray with me.
[5717.62 → 5722.10] Father, again, we praise you.
[5722.10 → 5723.10] We thank you.
[5723.10 → 5725.60] Lord, we thank you for all that you have given us.
[5725.60 → 5731.00] Lord, we thank you for just hearing all the expressions of Thanksgiving and gratitude
[5731.00 → 5732.56] earlier in our service.
[5732.56 → 5735.06] Lord, we thank you for all the children.
[5735.06 → 5738.30] We thank you for the Ladder Food Bank.
[5738.30 → 5740.16] We thank you for our music.
[5740.16 → 5741.94] We thank you for your word.
[5741.94 → 5750.12] We thank you for a church family, Lord, to come alongside us to know you and to follow you.
[5750.12 → 5753.52] Lord, we lift some of the needs in our congregation.
[5753.52 → 5758.50] Lord, we lift to you Nellie Craig who's had some trouble with her knee and has been
[5758.50 → 5759.50] doing different tests.
[5759.50 → 5763.24] Lord, we pray that you'd help the doctors to discover what is wrong.
[5763.24 → 5766.24] And Lord, would you help, would you heal her?
[5766.24 → 5771.88] Lord, we also pray for Valid who had surgery on his hand yesterday.
[5771.88 → 5777.74] Lord, it's been keeping him from being able to work in certain ways.
[5777.74 → 5781.24] Lord, we pray that that surgery would have been successful.
[5781.24 → 5783.48] Lord, that you would help him to recover.
[5783.48 → 5788.98] Help him, Lord, to be able to do the work that you have called him to do.
[5788.98 → 5793.74] Lord, we continue to lift to you those in our congregation who continue to mourn.
[5793.74 → 5798.48] Lord, Jim and Anita, Sandy.
[5798.48 → 5802.48] And Lord, we pray for those who continue to also suffer.
[5802.48 → 5807.48] We think of Angela and Shirley.
[5807.48 → 5812.48] We think of Annette who is still home recovering but still continues to struggle.
[5812.48 → 5817.22] Lord, and for many other people, Lord, that we know and that we care about.
[5817.22 → 5819.22] And Lord, who suffer in different ways.
[5819.22 → 5822.22] Lord, would you be close and draw near to each one of them this morning.
[5822.22 → 5830.22] Lord, as we think about the world, and we woke up yesterday hearing about a great conflict
[5830.22 → 5833.96] that has erupted in Israel, between Israel and Palestine.
[5833.96 → 5835.96] Lord, would you have mercy.
[5835.96 → 5841.76] Lord, would you bring shalom, the shalom that you promised that would come.
[5841.76 → 5846.66] Would you bring it soon into this situation so that no more lives would be lost.
[5846.66 → 5853.06] Lord, we pray for wisdom and for your help to overcome all the struggles that we have
[5853.06 → 5855.50] with one another.
[5855.50 → 5861.74] Lord, continue to be with us, Lord, as we give you thanks the rest of this Sunday and
[5861.74 → 5865.74] tomorrow as we celebrate Thanksgiving with friends and family.
[5865.74 → 5870.14] Lord, would you help our hearts to always be grateful.
[5870.14 → 5875.38] Help us to probe the reasons that we have for gratitude to you.
[5875.38 → 5879.56] And Lord, we thank you for our time of worship this morning and that we can bring all of our
[5879.56 → 5882.20] needs before you and that you hear us.
[5882.20 → 5883.56] We pray in Jesus' name.
[5883.56 → 5884.56] Amen.
[5884.56 → 5885.56] Please stand.
[5885.56 → 5890.36] We'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5890.36 → 5896.14] And do join us for time of fellowship in the hall right through the doors after the service.
[5896.14 → 5899.08] So I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5899.08 → 5901.54] May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5901.54 → 5905.52] May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5905.52 → 5909.68] May the Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[5909.68 → 5910.68] Amen.
[5910.68 → 5912.68] Remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[5912.68 → 5923.26] Let all things now living a song of Thanksgiving to God the Creator triumphantly praise.
[5923.26 → 5938.84] Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us.
[5938.84 → 5950.42] Who still guide us unto the end of our days.
[5950.42 → 5956.56] His manners are o'er us, his light goes before us.
[5956.56 → 5962.70] The pillar of fire will Sergeant at the light.
[5962.70 → 5976.20] The will shadows have vanished and darkness is banished, as for would we travel from light into light.
[5976.20 → 5989.40] His glory enforces the stars in their courses, the sun in His orbit obediently shine.
[5989.76 → 6002.04] The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains, the dims of the ocean proclaim Him divine.
[6002.04 → 6015.14] We too shall be voicing, of love and rejoicing, with glad and adoration, a song let us rise.
[6015.56 → 6029.22] Till all things now living, united Thanksgiving, to God in the highest, Hosanna and praise.
