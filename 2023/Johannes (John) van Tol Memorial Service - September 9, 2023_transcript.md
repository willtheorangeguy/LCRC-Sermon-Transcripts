[3104.28 --> 3109.28]  Let's all stand and we'll sing.
[3109.28 --> 3114.28]  Let's all stand and we'll sing.

[3119.28 --> 3124.28]  Let's all stand and we'll sing.
[3124.28 --> 3128.28]  And we'll sing.
[3128.28 --> 3131.28]  Let's all stand and we'll sing.
[3131.28 --> 3138.28]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[3138.28 --> 3145.28]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[3160.28 --> 3165.28]  Uncle John was such a good man and a godly husband to my mother.
[3165.28 --> 3175.28]  And for the last 18 years, my siblings and I were blessed to have him as a kind and loving father.
[3175.28 --> 3180.28]  I cannot express in words how much that means to me.
[3180.28 --> 3186.28]  So I will read Psalm 23 in honor of our Uncle Dad.
[3186.28 --> 3191.28]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[3191.28 --> 3195.28]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[3195.28 --> 3199.28]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[3199.28 --> 3201.28]  He restores my soul.
[3201.28 --> 3207.28]  He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[3207.28 --> 3213.28]  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[3213.28 --> 3216.28]  For you are with me.
[3216.28 --> 3220.28]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[3220.28 --> 3225.28]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[3225.28 --> 3228.28]  You anoint my head with oil.
[3228.28 --> 3231.28]  My cup overflows.
[3231.28 --> 3238.28]  Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life.
[3238.28 --> 3242.28]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[3242.28 --> 3243.28]  Amen.
[3243.28 --> 3244.28]  Amen.
[3244.28 --> 3245.28]  .
[3245.28 --> 3256.28]  .
[3256.28 --> 3258.28]  .
[3258.28 --> 3260.28]  .
[3260.28 --> 3263.28]  .
[3263.28 --> 3264.28]  .
[3264.28 --> 3265.28]  .
[3265.28 --> 3267.28]  .
[3267.28 --> 3269.28]  .
[3269.28 --> 3270.28]  .
[3270.28 --> 3271.28]  .
[3271.28 --> 3291.28]  And peace like a river, I've ended my way, and sorrows I see in the throne.
[3291.28 --> 3310.10]  Whatever I long, thou hast taught me to stay, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[3310.10 --> 3332.10]  It is well, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[3332.10 --> 3351.10]  For Satan should come, and your trial should come, and his blessed assurance control.
[3351.10 --> 3371.10]  But Christ has regarded my helpless escape, and has shed his own blood for my soul.
[3371.10 --> 3393.10]  It is well, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[3393.10 --> 3405.10]  I see, O the face of his glorious light.
[3405.10 --> 3434.10]  I see, O the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
[3435.10 --> 3445.10]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3445.10 --> 3457.10]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3457.10 --> 3471.10]  O Lord, praise the day when my faith shall be sung.
[3471.10 --> 3473.10]  I see, O the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, for my soul.
[3473.10 --> 3475.10]  God, praise to God.
[3475.10 --> 3479.10]  God and be told me, O the Lord, for my soul.
[3479.10 --> 3485.10]  I see, O the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, for my soul.
[3485.10 --> 3500.10]  And the Lord shall be sent, even so, it is well with my soul.
[3500.10 --> 3511.10]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3511.10 --> 3524.22]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3530.10 --> 3538.10]  That was good singing everyone.
[3538.10 --> 3543.10]  That was fun.
[3543.10 --> 3546.10]  Yes.
[3546.10 --> 3551.10]  So brothers and sisters, let's turn to God's Word.
[3551.10 --> 3557.10]  So the Word that John believed in and that he trusted in.
[3557.10 --> 3566.10]  I want to read for us just a few verses from the Gospel of John, chapter 14, verses 1-6.
[3566.10 --> 3569.10]  This is Jesus speaking.
[3569.10 --> 3571.10]  Jesus says,
[3571.10 --> 3601.10] 
[3601.10 --> 3631.10] 
[3631.10 --> 3632.10]  Let's pray together.
[3632.10 --> 3634.10]  Please pray with me.
[3634.10 --> 3638.10]  Lord, we come before you in this brief time that we have.
[3638.10 --> 3640.10]  And we come before your Word.
[3640.10 --> 3644.10]  We thank you, Lord, that it is true and that you give it to us because you love us.
[3644.10 --> 3650.10]  You give it to us in order to comfort our hearts, just like you comforted those first disciples.
[3650.10 --> 3663.10]  And so, Lord, would you do your ministry among us of opening our eyes, our hearts to the truth of your Word, that it would be our comfort and our hope today and for all days.
[3663.10 --> 3664.10]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3664.10 --> 3665.10]  Amen.
[3665.10 --> 3670.10]  So, as we read this passage, in this passage, Jesus is talking to his disciples.
[3670.10 --> 3675.10]  His disciples were his closest group of followers and friends.
[3675.10 --> 3678.10]  And he's not talking to everybody.
[3678.10 --> 3682.10]  You know, they would be large crowds of people who would follow Jesus.
[3682.10 --> 3683.10]  Thousands of people.
[3683.10 --> 3688.10]  But here, he's just talking to his closest few, his friends.
[3688.10 --> 3692.10]  The ones who have actually been with him for three years.
[3692.10 --> 3699.10]  Now, can you imagine what it would have been like to be with Jesus for that time, for three years?
[3699.10 --> 3700.10]  Right?
[3700.10 --> 3702.10]  They saw some pretty amazing things.
[3702.10 --> 3707.10]  Not, what is it, motors flying off into lakes.
[3707.10 --> 3711.10]  But what they did see was Jesus walking on a lake.
[3711.10 --> 3712.10]  Pretty cool, too.
[3712.10 --> 3715.10]  They saw him turn water into wine.
[3715.10 --> 3717.10]  They saw him heal people.
[3717.10 --> 3720.10]  They saw him cast out evil spirits.
[3720.10 --> 3724.10]  They saw him feed a huge crowd like the Van Toll family.
[3724.10 --> 3729.10]  But even bigger crowds of people with only five loaves and two fish.
[3729.10 --> 3733.10]  But they also had intimate moments with Jesus.
[3733.10 --> 3740.10]  You know, just sharing everyday life together, like we love to do with the ones that we love.
[3740.10 --> 3745.10]  They would walk with him on the road.
[3745.10 --> 3747.10]  They would share meals together.
[3747.10 --> 3752.10]  They would share friendship and laughter and embrace.
[3752.10 --> 3756.10]  And, again, these disciples were Jesus' closest friends.
[3756.10 --> 3757.10]  And they loved him.
[3757.10 --> 3759.10]  And he loved them.
[3759.10 --> 3763.10]  And with him, they were truly at home.
[3763.10 --> 3764.10]  They loved them.
[3764.10 --> 3765.10]  And they loved them.
[3765.10 --> 3770.10]  But then, after being with Jesus for these three years, very unexpectedly,
[3770.10 --> 3776.10]  Jesus began to tell them something that was deeply troubling.
[3776.10 --> 3780.10]  He told them that he was going to leave them.
[3780.10 --> 3783.10]  That he was going to leave them very soon.
[3783.10 --> 3788.10]  And that, in fact, he was going to die on a cross.
[3788.10 --> 3797.76]  this was deeply troubling to Jesus's friends right they were probably confused what is going
[3797.76 --> 3802.68]  on what are you talking about you know they were they were grieved at this news that he would be
[3802.68 --> 3810.12]  departing from them that he was actually going to die they had troubled hearts that's what it says
[3810.12 --> 3818.58]  here and I think for all of us as well in moments like this at a memorial service facing the death
[3818.58 --> 3829.20]  of a friend and a loved one we also have troubled hearts right we didn't want John to depart to leave
[3829.20 --> 3837.12]  us and so our hearts are sad and they are troubled you know because the Bible tells us you and I were
[3837.12 --> 3844.88]  not created to have loved ones ripped away from us right that wasn't God's intentions that wasn't
[3844.88 --> 3851.34]  God's design that happened because of sin that came into the world because of our own disobedience
[3851.34 --> 3859.78]  you and I were created by God to enjoy the people that you love to enjoy them forever face to face
[3859.78 --> 3867.96]  cheek to cheek without separation right that's and that's why we grieve we grieve when death tears us
[3867.96 --> 3875.22]  from each other and that's why what Jesus says here in John 14 is so precious and it is so comforting to
[3875.22 --> 3883.28]  us right Jesus he sees that his friends are troubled he can of course see it on their faces their downcast
[3883.28 --> 3893.52]  faces and he speaks words of comfort and of hope to them and to us he says do not let your hearts be
[3893.52 --> 3902.24]  troubled you believe in God believe also in me or you trust in God trust in me now think about that for a
[3902.24 --> 3911.04]  moment for a moment here I don't know about you but does that not sound kind of presumptuous I mean if you were to
[3911.04 --> 3920.40]  comfort someone yeah okay well it if it wasn't too big of a deal you might say to them don't worry
[3920.40 --> 3926.70]  believe in me okay so maybe like if a child is troubled because they can't tie their shoelace by
[3926.70 --> 3931.20]  themselves or maybe they can't put the worm on the hook or something like that you could say don't be
[3931.20 --> 3939.12]  troubled I can help you trust me right you know you're gonna be fishing in no time we'll work it out
[3939.12 --> 3946.52]  but here Jesus's friends are troubled they're grieved why because Jesus is going to die they're
[3946.52 --> 3951.20]  going to be separated from the one they love it's not something that anyone has ever been able to fix
[3951.20 --> 3964.00]  but what does Jesus say don't be troubled death our final enemy I'm gonna fix that right and if you
[3964.00 --> 3970.56]  believe in me you don't have to worry about death you don't have to be separated from the people you love
[3970.56 --> 3980.00]  so take heart it'll be okay friends no one has ever been able to say such a thing and the reason that
[3980.00 --> 3988.00]  Jesus can say that is because he did go and die on the cross his life wasn't taken away from him he gave his life he
[3988.00 --> 3997.68]  laid it down so that he could set us free from sin and from death and then he proved it by rising from the dead
[3997.68 --> 4005.28]  conquering our final enemy and so Jesus in this passage he's inviting us to trust him to believe in him
[4005.28 --> 4015.60]  even in the face of death and Jesus says a couple of things here I want to mention very briefly that comfort our hearts
[4015.60 --> 4024.00]  first Jesus says that there is a home for us okay there's a home for us so in verse 2 he says my
[4024.00 --> 4032.00]  father's house has many rooms now when Jesus talks about his father's house what's he talking about
[4032.96 --> 4038.08]  he's talking about heaven the bible doesn't actually give us many details about heaven I have lots of
[4038.08 --> 4043.12]  questions about heaven what is it going to be like the bible doesn't give us the answers that we might want
[4043.12 --> 4050.64]  but what Jesus does tell us is the most important thing about heaven that we need to know he tells
[4050.64 --> 4057.04]  us that it is the place where God is it's the place where God dwells and he says also my father's house
[4057.04 --> 4064.96]  has many rooms and the word that Jesus uses for rooms it suggests something permanent something lasting and
[4064.96 --> 4072.00]  fixed and secure right not not a mobile home not van life not a rental that can be taken away from you
[4072.72 --> 4081.52]  he's talking about permanent home and so Jesus says to us don't be troubled because there is a home
[4081.52 --> 4089.28]  for you with God forever there is a home in heaven for you and that means that you will dwell with the one
[4089.28 --> 4096.40]  that you were created for which is God himself because he loves you now the second thing Jesus
[4096.40 --> 4102.88]  tells us that he is preparing the way Jesus says in verse 2 I am going there to prepare a place for you
[4104.08 --> 4109.28]  now when we hear that Jesus is going to prepare a place for us the first thing that might come into
[4109.28 --> 4117.36]  our mind is that Jesus is going to go to heaven and use his carpentry skills right he's a carpenter as a
[4117.36 --> 4122.96]  young man he's going to go up there and he's going to do a van toll construction project and he's going
[4122.96 --> 4129.36]  to build all these houses for us in heaven well that's not actually what Jesus means he says I am
[4129.36 --> 4138.16]  going to prepare a place for you and every time in John's gospel that Jesus talks about going or departing
[4138.16 --> 4143.76]  it's a reference to the cross so when Jesus says I am going to prepare a place for you he's saying
[4143.76 --> 4152.00]  that his death on the cross is how he prepares a place for us with God the Father it is through the
[4152.00 --> 4160.08]  death of Jesus that he died in our place to pay the penalty for our sin so that we can be reconciled
[4160.08 --> 4168.16]  with God our relationship with God could be healed and that we can have a home with him okay so Jesus's
[4168.16 --> 4174.00]  disciples are troubled in their hearts Jesus is going away to comfort them Jesus said it is better
[4174.00 --> 4181.44]  that I go because in my going through my death and resurrection I am going to make a place for you
[4182.16 --> 4189.28]  that you can be with me forever right I have to go so that we can be together
[4189.28 --> 4200.40]  but then there's a third and final thing that Jesus wants us to believe and trust and this is
[4200.40 --> 4208.08]  where Thomas comes onto the scene Thomas is one of Jesus's close disciples Thomas raises his hand and
[4208.08 --> 4215.84]  he's he's Jesus I don't get it what what are you talking about and it's good that there's a Thomas like
[4215.84 --> 4220.56]  that in the Bible because I can relate to Thomas I have all kinds of things that I don't understand
[4220.56 --> 4227.84]  what Jesus is saying so Jesus for us or sorry Thomas for us raises his hand in verse 5 he asks this
[4227.84 --> 4236.96]  question Lord we don't know where you're going how can we know the way in other words okay Jesus I get
[4236.96 --> 4244.56]  there is a home for us in heaven you are preparing the way for us to be there but how do we get there
[4244.56 --> 4254.16]  right how are we supposed to know the way and so Jesus answers him Jesus says I am the way and the
[4254.16 --> 4261.20]  truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me you know in Thomas's question though
[4261.20 --> 4267.20]  reveals that he doesn't quite understand what Jesus is all about he doesn't understand why did Jesus come
[4267.20 --> 4276.08]  on this mission to earth he's viewing Jesus as someone who must come to do what to lead the way
[4276.72 --> 4283.28]  to show us how to get to God right just like maybe he's a trailblazer or a guide of some sort
[4284.00 --> 4289.76]  and he's saying Jesus if you don't show us the way how will we know how to get there how can we follow you
[4289.76 --> 4296.40]  but friends Jesus is not saying I'm an example for you to follow he's not just a good teacher he's
[4296.40 --> 4304.96]  saying I am the way itself if you have me if you are in relationship with me you have the way to God
[4306.32 --> 4313.76]  believing and trusting in Jesus friends is the way to God Jesus didn't come just to be our guide
[4313.76 --> 4321.68]  and expect us to follow him and do our best to keep up no he came to be our savior and that's why
[4321.68 --> 4332.32]  Jesus says no one comes to the father except through me there is no other way for you or I to be forgiven
[4332.32 --> 4339.20]  of our sins there is no other way for us to be reconciled with a God who loves us and who created us
[4339.20 --> 4347.92]  there is no other way than to put our hope and our trust in Jesus Jesus is the one who has conquered
[4347.92 --> 4355.04]  sin has forgiven us and who has conquered death and he has made a home for us to dwell with God forever
[4356.40 --> 4361.76]  you know one of the last times I visited John I think as many of us did he was living at Mountain View
[4361.76 --> 4370.56]  Manor and as much as that was the right place for him at that stage of his life he didn't want to be
[4370.56 --> 4381.44]  there did he where do you want to go home let's go home let's roll which is of course understandable
[4382.56 --> 4387.92]  so the last time I visited you know he was rolling around his wheelchair and we take a walk go outside
[4387.92 --> 4394.40]  and while we were there outside he said to me hey man do you have a key to this gate
[4397.44 --> 4405.52]  he wanted me to help him break out right you know I said I'm so sorry I don't have the key you know he
[4405.52 --> 4415.20]  just said oh well that's too bad you know I don't have the key to the gate as much as I may have wanted
[4415.20 --> 4427.60]  to I couldn't take John home but do you know who has the key to get home Jesus friends Jesus is the way
[4428.16 --> 4435.52]  the truth and the life Jesus has the key to the gates of heaven and he opens that gate for us he welcomes
[4435.52 --> 4444.56]  us that through faith in him we can go to our true home the home that we all long for we can go home we can
[4444.56 --> 4456.08]  dwell with God forever I couldn't open the gate John put his faith in Jesus Jesus opened that gate and John
[4456.08 --> 4465.68]  is with God in his eternal home right now he got his wish please pray with me
[4465.68 --> 4484.40]  heavenly father in Jesus Christ your son you made a way for us to dwell in your house to be home with you
[4486.00 --> 4493.76]  we thank you for sending Jesus to make the way for us not just to show us the way but to be the way
[4493.76 --> 4499.20]  we thank you for the way through his death and his victory over death so Lord would you by your spirit
[4499.20 --> 4509.04]  help each of us to receive by faith the way that Jesus has opened for us by trusting in him and father
[4509.04 --> 4515.44]  would you bring each of us finally into your heavenly kingdom so that together with John and with all the
[4515.44 --> 4520.72]  saints who have gone before us that we might glorify you and live in the joy of your presence and we ask all
[4520.72 --> 4540.16]  this through Jesus Christ our Lord amen let's stand we'll sing our final song we'll sing amazing grace please stand
[4540.16 --> 4559.64]  good
[4559.64 --> 4571.78]  The waiting praise, how sweet the sound
[4571.78 --> 4579.30]  Has saved a wretch like me
[4579.30 --> 4589.30]  I once was lost, but now am found
[4589.30 --> 4596.30]  Was blind, but now I see
[4596.30 --> 4607.30]  The grace that taught my heart to hear
[4607.30 --> 4615.30]  And grace my fears to be near
[4615.30 --> 4625.30]  How precious in that grace appear
[4625.30 --> 4633.30]  The hour I first believe
[4633.30 --> 4643.30]  When we give air and out to hear
[4643.30 --> 4652.30]  Christ shining as the sun
[4652.30 --> 4662.30]  We know that it is to sing God's praise
[4662.30 --> 4669.30]  And when we first become
[4669.30 --> 4679.30]  Would you pray with me?
[4679.30 --> 4686.30]  Our Father, in this moment of real victory for John
[4686.30 --> 4691.30]  We join our hearts with him in exalting your name
[4691.30 --> 4696.30]  We lift our hearts in praise for the love that you gave for John's salvation
[4696.30 --> 4697.30]  And for our own
[4697.30 --> 4703.30]  And for the promises in your word that we have the unshakable assurance of eternal life
[4703.30 --> 4705.30]  Because Jesus died for us
[4705.30 --> 4706.30]  And he rose for us
[4706.30 --> 4708.30]  And he now lives for us
[4708.30 --> 4712.30]  And Jesus, you called yourself the shepherd of the sheep
[4712.30 --> 4716.30]  You called the Holy Spirit the comforter of our sorrows
[4716.30 --> 4721.30]  And so Lord, we ask that you would shepherd and comfort this dear family
[4721.30 --> 4723.30]  These dear friends
[4723.30 --> 4727.30]  With the knowledge that John is no longer a pilgrim here on earth
[4727.30 --> 4730.30]  But now through Jesus is in your presence
[4730.30 --> 4732.30]  And his faith has become sight
[4732.30 --> 4737.30]  So Lord, we ask that you would give us your comfort in the coming days
[4737.30 --> 4739.30]  Help us to find our hope in you
[4739.30 --> 4741.30]  And so trust the one who loved us
[4741.30 --> 4743.30]  And gave himself for us
[4743.30 --> 4745.30]  And we pray all these things in Jesus' name
[4745.30 --> 4746.30]  Amen
[4746.30 --> 4748.30]  Friends, receive the benediction
[4748.30 --> 4752.30]  Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[4752.30 --> 4754.30]  As you trust in him
[4754.30 --> 4757.30]  So that you may overflow with hope
[4757.30 --> 4760.30]  By the power of the Holy Spirit
