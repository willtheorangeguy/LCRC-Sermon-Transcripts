[285.70 --> 288.70]  It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning.
[288.70 --> 292.70]  I want to extend a warm welcome to you, especially if you are new with us today.

[307.70 --> 309.70]  We decided to move that forward.
[309.70 --> 314.70]  So we're actually going to do that right before our community prayer, just so you know what's happening there.
[314.70 --> 322.70]  And then the other thing is we are planning our basic skills camp for this summer, the last week of July.
[322.70 --> 325.70]  And we have signed up sheets that are on the foyer table.
[325.70 --> 332.70]  And so we would love for as many people in our church to be involved, to serve in different ways,
[332.70 --> 342.70]  as all kinds of ways that you can serve and use your gifts, and to do that in order to bless our children, bless some of the children of our community.
[342.70 --> 346.70]  And so please do fill up those sign up sheets.
[346.70 --> 347.70]  Don't be shy.
[347.70 --> 348.70]  Don't delay.
[348.70 --> 352.70]  Let's just go ahead and fill them out so that we can plan and prepare.
[352.70 --> 354.70]  So please do consider that.
[354.70 --> 355.70]  Thank you.
[355.70 --> 360.70]  Please join with me as we hear the Lord call us into worship this morning.
[360.70 --> 364.70]  Our call to worship is from 1 Chronicles, chapter 16.
[364.70 --> 366.70]  Here's a, verse 13.
[366.70 --> 367.70]  Sing to the Lord.
[367.70 --> 368.70]  All the earth.
[368.70 --> 369.70]  All the earth.
[369.70 --> 373.70]  Proclaim his salvation day after day.
[373.70 --> 378.70]  Declare his glory among the nations.
[378.70 --> 381.70]  His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[381.70 --> 385.70]  For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[385.70 --> 388.70]  He is to be feared above all gods.
[388.70 --> 396.14]  For all the gods of the nations are worthless idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
[396.96 --> 402.52]  Splendor and majesty are before him. Strength and joy are in his dwelling place.
[403.64 --> 411.06]  Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen.
[411.68 --> 414.62]  Would you please join me in prayer? Let's praise our God together.
[414.62 --> 418.88]  Our Heavenly Father, we do worship you this morning.
[419.76 --> 426.18]  You are sitting on your throne and nothing falls outside of your rule and your reign.
[426.80 --> 434.36]  Lord, nothing is outside of your good and just ways and your purposes, Lord, for your creation.
[435.44 --> 438.58]  And, O God, you are good and you are good to us, your people.
[438.58 --> 447.34]  You sent your Son, Jesus Christ, to come and rescue us, to win us back from darkness, and to bring us into your light.
[447.88 --> 451.60]  To welcome us while we were orphans and bring us into your family.
[453.12 --> 458.90]  And, Lord, you came to lift us up when we were downcast because of our sin and failure.
[458.90 --> 465.96]  And we pray, O Lord, that in this worship service, that your Spirit would be here with us.
[466.52 --> 469.64]  We long for you to show us your love and your glory.
[470.28 --> 474.92]  We long to be transformed by your Spirit at work within us.
[475.58 --> 481.76]  That we may no longer bow the knee to the little gods, the idols of our own making,
[482.38 --> 485.86]  but rather kneel before you, our one true God and King.
[485.86 --> 490.38]  We pray in the sovereign name of Jesus, our Lord.
[490.96 --> 491.56]  Amen.

[505.02 --> 508.78]  As God has called us, he has welcomed us into his family,
[509.62 --> 511.54]  I invite us to turn and welcome one another.
[511.66 --> 514.86]  Now, I realize not everyone here will want to shake hands.
[514.86 --> 515.86]  That's okay.
[516.04 --> 519.12]  Just turn and greet with a smile and wave.
[519.60 --> 522.16]  And for those who want to shake hands, of course you may.

[719.36 --> 734.50]  It's days like today when I don't have much of a voice
[734.50 --> 737.24]  that I'm glad for a good singing church.
[737.98 --> 738.42]  All right?
[738.42 --> 743.46]  So as always, we are all together, the worship team,
[743.94 --> 747.00]  and grateful for those that have joined us on the platform today.
[747.00 --> 752.34]  But just let us rejoice in all the good truths that we'll sing about
[752.34 --> 756.46]  and hear about today, and how great is our God.
[756.46 --> 779.80]  The splendor of the King
[779.80 --> 785.14]  He wraps Himself in life
[785.14 --> 791.48]  That all we enjoy, all we enjoy
[791.48 --> 796.48]  He wraps Himself in life
[796.48 --> 801.82]  From the darkest trials to hide
[801.82 --> 807.82]  From tremendous hours to voice
[807.82 --> 812.16]  And how great is our love
[812.16 --> 814.16]  Sing with me
[814.16 --> 818.16]  How great is our love
[818.16 --> 819.36]  And how we sing

[961.58 --> 963.92]  Through that way through the song.
[963.92 --> 982.54]  From the ends of the earth
[982.54 --> 987.16]  From the ends of the heavens

[1006.40 --> 1012.70]  This song we praise God
[1012.70 --> 1016.94]  Throughout the endless ages
[1016.94 --> 1021.02]  We will be crowned with praises
[1021.02 --> 1024.78]  For all time
[1024.78 --> 1029.38]  Exalted in every nation
[1029.38 --> 1033.12]  Exalted in all creation

[1051.48 --> 1053.66]  From the winds of the earth
[1053.66 --> 1057.50]  Your name be praised
[1057.50 --> 1061.96]  In the hearts of the weak
[1061.96 --> 1067.72]  The shouts of the strongholds of all
[1067.72 --> 1070.22]  From the midst of all people
[1070.22 --> 1075.04]  The star remains golden
[1075.04 --> 1079.16]  Without the endless wages
[1079.16 --> 1082.96]  He'll be proud with grace
[1082.96 --> 1087.20]  For the Lord's time
[1087.20 --> 1091.34]  Insulted in every nation
[1091.34 --> 1095.32]  Souverte of all creation
[1095.32 --> 1098.78]  All the hopes of all
[1098.78 --> 1100.66]  In their divine
[1100.66 --> 1104.76]  In their divine
[1104.76 --> 1111.76]  Thank you. You may be seated.
[1111.76 --> 1124.18]  Our prayer of confession today is based on Psalm 103.
[1124.18 --> 1127.88]  And we will pray responsibly.
[1127.88 --> 1132.02]  And then I will invite you to pray silently
[1132.02 --> 1135.46]  And give us a moment, some space to come before the Lord
[1135.46 --> 1138.82]  In the quietness of our own hearts before Him.
[1139.52 --> 1143.72]  And the Lord is good to invite us and welcome us
[1143.72 --> 1147.08]  Into His embrace and to come as His children
[1147.08 --> 1153.06]  To confess the ways that we have not lived
[1153.06 --> 1155.14]  According to the way He has called us to.
[1155.74 --> 1159.70]  So let's say this prayer together.
[1159.70 --> 1163.40]  O Lord, you are compassionate and gracious
[1163.40 --> 1166.80]  Slow to anger and abounding in love
[1166.80 --> 1169.02]  You will not always accuse
[1169.02 --> 1171.42]  Nor will you keep your anger forever
[1171.42 --> 1175.46]  Do not treat us as our sins deserve
[1175.46 --> 1179.38]  Or repay us according to our iniquities
[1179.38 --> 1182.54]  As high as the heavens are above the earth
[1182.54 --> 1186.16]  So great is your love for those who fear you
[1186.16 --> 1189.38]  Remove our transgressions from us
[1189.38 --> 1192.80]  As far as the east is from the west
[1192.80 --> 1196.80]  As a father has compassion on his children, O Lord
[1196.80 --> 1200.14]  Have compassion on those who fear you
[1200.14 --> 1203.74]  For you know how we are formed
[1203.74 --> 1206.92]  You remember that we are dust
[1206.92 --> 1211.16]  Lord, hear our silent confessions before you now
[1211.16 --> 1215.14]  And Lord, would your Spirit search our hearts
[1215.14 --> 1219.40]  And show us the places where we need your love
[1219.40 --> 1219.98]  And your healing
[1219.98 --> 1242.82]  God, our Father, has given us nothing less
[1242.82 --> 1244.80]  Than His own Son
[1244.80 --> 1247.82]  To give us pardon from our sin
[1247.82 --> 1250.18]  That we might be pure and holy
[1250.18 --> 1253.96]  That we might be mended and healed
[1253.96 --> 1257.06]  And in Jesus, friends, we have all that we need
[1257.06 --> 1262.10]  So, brothers and sisters
[1262.10 --> 1265.42]  Do you renounce the sinful desires
[1265.42 --> 1267.90]  That separate you from God and from His people?
[1270.40 --> 1273.16]  Do you renounce the evil powers of this world
[1273.16 --> 1276.12]  That corrupt and destroy His good creation?
[1276.12 --> 1282.04]  Do you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces of wickedness
[1282.04 --> 1283.44]  That rebel against God?
[1284.88 --> 1288.36]  Please rise and hear these words of forgiveness and pardon
[1288.36 --> 1294.76]  See what great love the Father has lavished on us
[1294.76 --> 1297.30]  That we should be called children of God
[1297.30 --> 1300.64]  Dear friends, we know that when Christ appears
[1300.64 --> 1302.56]  We shall be like Him
[1302.56 --> 1305.80]  For we shall see Him as He is
[1305.80 --> 1310.48]  He appeared so that He might take away our sins
[1310.48 --> 1313.68]  And in Him is no sin
[1313.68 --> 1315.44]  Thanks be to God
[1315.44 --> 1317.96]  Let's sing our next song together
[1317.96 --> 1323.88]  Lord have mercy
[1323.88 --> 1336.74]  Lord have mercy
[1336.74 --> 1339.80]  Lord have mercy
[1339.80 --> 1342.66]  Lord have mercy
[1342.66 --> 1344.72]  Lord have mercy
[1344.72 --> 1347.18]  Lord have mercy
[1347.18 --> 1350.72]  Lord have mercy
[1350.72 --> 1350.96]  Lord have mercy
[1350.96 --> 1354.00]  Christ have mercy
[1354.00 --> 1355.34]  Lord have mercy
[1355.34 --> 1356.84]  Lord have mercy
[1356.84 --> 1357.04]  Lord have mercy
[1357.04 --> 1358.72]  Lord have mercy
[1358.72 --> 1367.70]  General
[1388.72 --> 1393.72]  But now I see.
[1397.30 --> 1399.72]  Lord have mercy.
[1401.06 --> 1403.72]  Christ have mercy.
[1404.44 --> 1406.72]  Lord have mercy.
[1407.72 --> 1408.72]  Glory.
[1410.72 --> 1413.72]  Lord have mercy.
[1413.72 --> 1416.72]  Christ have mercy.
[1416.72 --> 1418.72]  Christ have mercy.
[1418.72 --> 1420.72]  Lord have mercy.
[1420.72 --> 1422.72]  Lord have mercy.
[1422.72 --> 1426.72]  Amen.
[1426.72 --> 1428.72]  You may be seated.
[1437.72 --> 1445.72]  So at this time we invite our children and their teachers and assistants to go to their Sundays school classes.
[1445.72 --> 1453.72]  And for those of us who are not going to Sunday school we will remain here and look at God's word together.
[1453.72 --> 1471.72]  I'll be reading from Matthew 28 verse 16 to 20 and it's in your pew Bibles on page 743.
[1471.72 --> 1479.72]  Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[1479.72 --> 1483.72]  When they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted.
[1485.72 --> 1487.72]  Then Jesus came to them and said,
[1487.72 --> 1491.72]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1491.72 --> 1495.72]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations.
[1495.72 --> 1500.72]  Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1500.72 --> 1504.72]  And teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[1504.72 --> 1508.72]  And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[1508.72 --> 1510.72]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1510.72 --> 1514.72]  Praise to you, Lord.
[1514.72 --> 1526.72]  Please join me in prayer as we come before God's word.
[1526.72 --> 1537.72]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have determined from before the foundation of the earth to pursue those who are far off.
[1537.72 --> 1539.72]  Even us.
[1539.72 --> 1541.72]  To draw us to yourself.
[1541.72 --> 1543.72]  To teach us.
[1543.72 --> 1545.72]  And to disciple us.
[1545.72 --> 1555.72]  So, Lord, we pray that you would open now our eyes, our ears, our hearts to receive this word from you.
[1555.72 --> 1559.72]  Oh, Lord, show us who you are and the purpose that you have for your church.
[1559.72 --> 1561.72]  In the name of Jesus, we pray.
[1561.72 --> 1562.72]  Amen.
[1562.72 --> 1571.72]  So, if you've been with us the last few weeks, you will know that we are in a sermon series called A Vision for Renewal.
[1571.72 --> 1578.72]  And this series is organized around our new vision statement that we have as a church family.
[1578.72 --> 1584.72]  That we are called together for the renewal of all things through Jesus Christ.
[1584.72 --> 1590.72]  So, over the last few weeks, we've been talking about the ways that God, through Jesus Christ, comes and renews all things.
[1590.72 --> 1594.72]  And we saw that, first of all, it is anchored in Jesus Christ.
[1594.72 --> 1600.72]  That the whole gospel, all that Jesus is doing in the world, is in and through Jesus Christ.
[1600.72 --> 1608.72]  And so, we want to be a church that is centered and anchored in who he is and what he has done.
[1608.72 --> 1617.72]  And then we've seen that God is renewing our lives with him, making us to be worshipers, children of God.
[1617.72 --> 1634.72]  And then, in renewing us to himself, he also renews us in ourselves as individuals, transforming us into people who then look and act like Jesus, who is our Savior and who we worship.
[1634.72 --> 1643.72]  And then, as we are being renewed in ourselves, he enables us to then be renewed in relationships with other people.
[1643.72 --> 1648.72]  Our neighbors, our family, friends, others who are different from us.
[1648.72 --> 1652.72]  And he calls us together as the church, the body of Christ.
[1652.72 --> 1655.72]  And he teaches us how to love one another.
[1655.72 --> 1666.72]  And then, as the church, and what we're going to see today and next week, is that he takes his church, sinners who have been saved by grace, and he sends us out.
[1666.72 --> 1674.72]  He sends us out into the world, on mission in the world, to join him in his work of renewing all things.
[1674.72 --> 1678.72]  So that's what we're looking at today, this renewing of mission.
[1678.72 --> 1687.72]  And in our passage today, Matthew 28, 16 to 20, these are actually the very final words of the Gospel of Matthew.
[1687.72 --> 1689.72]  This is the climax.
[1689.72 --> 1697.72]  So at the beginning of Jesus' earthly ministry, Jesus gathered 12 disciples.
[1697.72 --> 1702.72]  And for three years, they followed him everywhere.
[1702.72 --> 1705.72]  Jesus shared his life with them.
[1705.72 --> 1706.72]  He taught them.
[1706.72 --> 1712.72]  They learned his ways until he was crucified and buried, and they thought it was all over.
[1712.72 --> 1717.72]  But then he rose from the dead, and for 40 days he appeared to them.
[1717.72 --> 1725.72]  And then, at the end of those 40 days, before he ascends back into heaven to the right hand of God, he gives them their mission.
[1725.72 --> 1728.72]  And he says, this is my calling for you.
[1728.72 --> 1733.72]  What I have started, you are going to continue.
[1733.72 --> 1743.72]  And so friends, it is crucial for us as a church to realize and then internalize the fact that we have a mission.
[1743.72 --> 1750.72]  That we have been called together to participate in the mission of God.
[1750.72 --> 1758.72]  And that has to give us a profound self-understanding of who we are as a church community.
[1758.72 --> 1762.72]  And so we're looking at Jesus' mission for his church.
[1762.72 --> 1771.72]  And as we do so, we're going to see that he answers five questions that Jesus' mission gives us.
[1771.72 --> 1776.72]  And I want us to look at these five aspects of the mission that we have.
[1776.72 --> 1777.72]  Okay?
[1777.72 --> 1779.72]  And it is the five things are this.
[1779.72 --> 1782.72]  The who, the what, the where, the how, and the why.
[1782.72 --> 1787.72]  So like good journalists, we're going to investigate the mission that Jesus has given us.
[1787.72 --> 1792.72]  We're going to ask the who, the what, the where, the how, and the why.
[1792.72 --> 1797.72]  And this will give us, friends, a deep sense of what Jesus has called us to as a church.
[1797.72 --> 1800.72]  And there's a lot to say here.
[1800.72 --> 1802.72]  And so we're going to jump right in.
[1802.72 --> 1803.72]  What is it?
[1803.72 --> 1806.72]  What is this mission that Jesus has given us his church?
[1806.72 --> 1810.72]  So first, the first question is the who.
[1810.72 --> 1814.72]  Who does Jesus call to his mission?
[1814.72 --> 1816.72]  And we find the answer to that in verse 16.
[1816.72 --> 1823.72]  Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to go.
[1823.72 --> 1830.72]  Now these 11 disciples are Jesus' closest followers.
[1830.72 --> 1837.72]  They are the ones that he called follow him at the very beginning of his ministry.
[1837.72 --> 1841.72]  It was, can you say them?
[1841.72 --> 1842.72]  I had to look it up.
[1842.72 --> 1843.72]  I should know this, right?
[1843.72 --> 1847.72]  Peter and his brother James.
[1847.72 --> 1848.72]  His brother Andrew.
[1848.72 --> 1850.72]  Thanks for catching me.
[1850.72 --> 1851.72]  Peter and his brother Andrew.
[1851.72 --> 1853.72]  James, son of Zebedee.
[1853.72 --> 1855.72]  His brother John.
[1855.72 --> 1857.72]  Philip and Bartholomew.
[1857.72 --> 1859.72]  Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector.
[1859.72 --> 1861.72]  James, son of Alphaeus.
[1861.72 --> 1862.72]  Okay, two James.
[1862.72 --> 1864.72]  And Thaddeus.
[1864.72 --> 1866.72]  And then Simon, the zealot.
[1866.72 --> 1870.72]  In addition to these 11, there were also women who followed Jesus.
[1870.72 --> 1871.72]  Right?
[1871.72 --> 1873.72]  Women like Mary and Susanna and Joanna.
[1873.72 --> 1878.72]  And along with them, there was also this unnamed number of disciples as well.
[1878.72 --> 1882.72]  But here, Jesus is gathering the leaders of his, of that group.
[1882.72 --> 1884.72]  The 11 disciples.
[1884.72 --> 1887.72]  And look, Matthew here doesn't call them apostles.
[1887.72 --> 1892.72]  He doesn't call them prophets or teachers or pastors.
[1892.72 --> 1894.72]  And they weren't yet called Christians.
[1894.72 --> 1900.72]  The title they are given is this humble title of disciple.
[1900.72 --> 1901.72]  A learner.
[1901.72 --> 1908.72]  Or, you know, if the word disciple sounds maybe very religious, you can think of the word apprentice.
[1908.72 --> 1914.72]  You know, maybe you can think of an apprentice who is learning woodworking.
[1914.72 --> 1916.72]  And they sit next to the master.
[1916.72 --> 1918.72]  And they learn all of the skills.
[1918.72 --> 1923.72]  And they learn the knowledge that the master has and that the master is teaching.
[1923.72 --> 1925.72]  And that's what a disciple is.
[1925.72 --> 1932.72]  And to be a disciple of Jesus means that you are learning Jesus' ways from him.
[1932.72 --> 1934.72]  Because he is your master.
[1934.72 --> 1937.72]  You're learning all that he taught.
[1937.72 --> 1939.72]  You're learning his way of life.
[1939.72 --> 1942.72]  How he loved and served people.
[1942.72 --> 1949.72]  And all of that, friends, is skills that a disciple has to spend the rest of their lives learning.
[1949.72 --> 1959.72]  But he says, the people who are part of my mission are the people who are continually having Christ formed in them.
[1959.72 --> 1962.72]  Learning how to love the way Jesus loves.
[1962.72 --> 1966.72]  Learning how to speak truth of the way Jesus speaks truth.
[1966.72 --> 1971.72]  And so when we answer this question, who does Jesus call to his mission?
[1971.72 --> 1978.72]  The answer is, Jesus sends disciples out on his mission.
[1978.72 --> 1983.72]  And if you, friends, are a Christian, that means you are a disciple.
[1983.72 --> 1985.72]  That Jesus is your master.
[1985.72 --> 1988.72]  That he has called you to learn his ways.
[1988.72 --> 1991.72]  And that includes each and every one of us.
[1991.72 --> 1995.72]  Okay? All of us have been called to be part of his mission.
[1995.72 --> 1999.72]  So that's the who. Disciples.
[1999.72 --> 2003.72]  The second question that we see in this passage is the what.
[2003.72 --> 2008.72]  What then is the mission that Jesus has called us, his disciples, to?
[2008.72 --> 2011.72]  So let's look at verse 19.
[2011.72 --> 2016.72]  Therefore, go and make disciples.
[2016.72 --> 2021.72]  So Jesus gathers the 11 disciples and he says, here's your mission.
[2021.72 --> 2023.72]  And he gives them a simple command.
[2023.72 --> 2025.72]  Go make disciples.
[2025.72 --> 2032.72]  In other words, don't think to yourselves like, hey, you know, this is kind of nice.
[2032.72 --> 2034.72]  Jesus, look at what you have done.
[2034.72 --> 2035.72]  This is wonderful.
[2035.72 --> 2037.72]  We have this nice group here.
[2037.72 --> 2038.72]  We're kind of cozy.
[2038.72 --> 2040.72]  We're really kind of comfortable here.
[2040.72 --> 2041.72]  We can be your fan club.
[2041.72 --> 2044.72]  We can keep you in our memory.
[2044.72 --> 2047.72]  And we should be all good to go now.
[2047.72 --> 2050.72]  But that's, that's not what Jesus's plan is.
[2050.72 --> 2052.72]  What does Jesus say?
[2052.72 --> 2054.72]  He says, go.
[2054.72 --> 2055.72]  Get moving.
[2055.72 --> 2058.72]  It's like trying to get my kids out the door for school.
[2058.72 --> 2060.72]  Get out the door.
[2060.72 --> 2061.72]  Right?
[2061.72 --> 2062.72]  Go.
[2062.72 --> 2063.72]  And that's what Jesus is doing for us.
[2063.72 --> 2064.72]  Go.
[2064.72 --> 2065.72]  Go.
[2065.72 --> 2066.72]  Make disciples.
[2066.72 --> 2067.72]  Go.
[2067.72 --> 2073.72]  In other words, Jesus is telling them, as you, my church, go and spread all over the
[2073.72 --> 2075.72]  world, take the gospel with you.
[2075.72 --> 2080.72]  The command, the verb there, the imperative is make disciples.
[2080.72 --> 2082.72]  And the go is a parsable.
[2082.72 --> 2086.72]  So he says, make disciples going.
[2086.72 --> 2091.72]  As you go, as you go, make disciples.
[2091.72 --> 2098.72]  And, and so therefore, as we go out into the world, making disciples through our words,
[2098.72 --> 2105.72]  through our lives, people that not only hear the good news that Jesus is the king, but they
[2105.72 --> 2106.72]  believe it.
[2106.72 --> 2110.72]  And they too become disciples of Jesus.
[2110.72 --> 2114.72]  And when you read the book of Acts, what do, what do we discover that happens?
[2114.72 --> 2117.72]  It says, the church grew day by day.
[2117.72 --> 2123.72]  It says, the Lord added to their number daily, those who are being saved.
[2123.72 --> 2130.72]  And so the vision that Jesus gives us here is that of disciples making disciples who make
[2130.72 --> 2138.72]  disciples, who make disciples, who make disciples, who make disciples, and so on.
[2138.72 --> 2143.72]  But there's this another aspect of this, of the mission of making disciples that, you know,
[2143.72 --> 2146.72]  that we saw there, and it's that word go.
[2146.72 --> 2149.72]  Therefore, go and make disciples.
[2149.72 --> 2151.72]  Now this passage is often referred to as what?
[2151.72 --> 2153.72]  Do you know what this is called?
[2153.72 --> 2155.72]  The Great Commission.
[2155.72 --> 2156.72]  Right?
[2156.72 --> 2157.72]  The Great Commission.
[2157.72 --> 2158.72]  Maybe you've heard that.
[2158.72 --> 2162.72]  But this phrase hasn't always been around actually.
[2162.72 --> 2165.72]  It was actually kind of coined sometime in the 1600s.
[2165.72 --> 2171.72]  So you can imagine for like 1500 years of the church, if you went and said, hey, you know, have you read the Great Commission?
[2171.72 --> 2174.72]  And they would look at you like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[2174.72 --> 2180.72]  But this phrase actually became popularized by a missionary named William Carey.
[2180.72 --> 2187.72]  And so in the 1800s, William Carey was trying to advocate for foreign missions.
[2187.72 --> 2194.72]  And this was the beginning of the kind of the world Christian, the foreign mission movement, to get churches involved in missions.
[2194.72 --> 2205.72]  And so he used this phrase, the Great Commission, as a call for individuals to be sent out as foreign missionaries.
[2205.72 --> 2210.72]  Now, I think that is a valid application of this passage.
[2210.72 --> 2213.72]  But here's the thing we have to realize.
[2213.72 --> 2216.72]  It is great for churches to send and support missionaries.
[2216.72 --> 2218.72]  And as a church, we do that.
[2218.72 --> 2224.72]  But Jesus's words are not just for a few people who go overseas.
[2224.72 --> 2228.72]  Jesus doesn't want a church that sends missionaries.
[2228.72 --> 2232.72]  He wants a whole church that is on mission.
[2232.72 --> 2233.72]  Right?
[2233.72 --> 2244.72]  We're not just a church that sends missionaries, but a church that is missional, where everyone in the church is called to this mission that Jesus has given us.
[2244.72 --> 2249.72]  In Matthew chapter 9, Jesus says this to his disciples.
[2249.72 --> 2253.72]  The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[2253.72 --> 2258.72]  Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest.
[2258.72 --> 2260.72]  And I always read that passage.
[2260.72 --> 2264.72]  And I was like, okay, so the calling for me here, how do I obey this?
[2264.72 --> 2266.72]  Well, that means I will pray.
[2266.72 --> 2267.72]  Okay, Lord, I will pray.
[2267.72 --> 2270.72]  Lord, would you send more missionaries out into the world?
[2270.72 --> 2275.72]  Lord, send someone to go and preach the gospel to people who have never heard it before.
[2275.72 --> 2278.72]  And yeah, we should pray that.
[2278.72 --> 2286.72]  But then in Matthew, do you know what happens right after Jesus asked them to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into the harvest?
[2286.72 --> 2291.72]  The very next passage, Jesus sends them out.
[2291.72 --> 2294.72]  Jesus says, pray for people to be sent out.
[2294.72 --> 2299.72]  And oh, by the way, that's you.
[2299.72 --> 2307.72]  In a church that just sends missionaries, only a few participate in the Great Commission.
[2307.72 --> 2312.72]  But in a missional church, everyone is part of the Great Commission.
[2312.72 --> 2318.72]  And that means that all of us will have some goingness to our lives.
[2318.72 --> 2329.72]  Each one of us, there has to be some aspect of leaving what is our normal, comfortable routine, our comfortable life, and going out.
[2329.72 --> 2332.72]  Stepping out, maybe outside of our, where we're comfortable.
[2332.72 --> 2335.72]  And so maybe I'm not going to go across the world.
[2335.72 --> 2342.72]  But going might mean to my next door neighbor that I've never talked to.
[2342.72 --> 2349.72]  You know, maybe I go out there and I get my mail and I take the garbage to the curb, but I've never really actually talked to them.
[2349.72 --> 2356.72]  And so going, for me, might mean to take the initiative to go strike up a conversation, to learn their story.
[2356.72 --> 2359.72]  Maybe even invite them for a meal.
[2359.72 --> 2362.72]  And maybe that would feel risky to us.
[2362.72 --> 2365.72]  You know, going outside of our normal lives.
[2365.72 --> 2372.72]  And so to live out this mission that Jesus gave us, we all need to have some goingness to our lives.
[2372.72 --> 2384.72]  Because the kingdom of God spreads when you and I want the people that we know to become people who know Jesus Christ.
[2384.72 --> 2386.72]  And to love him.
[2386.72 --> 2388.72]  That's our, that's our motivation.
[2388.72 --> 2393.72]  We want the people that we know in our lives to become people who know and love Jesus.
[2393.72 --> 2397.72]  So where is the place that God is calling you to go?
[2397.72 --> 2409.72]  Right, as you think about your workplace, your family, your connections, your friendship group, your neighborhood, or your school, or the sports your kids are involved in.
[2409.72 --> 2417.72]  In any of those places, do you have the mentality that I am being sent here by Jesus?
[2417.72 --> 2421.72]  That even in my ordinary life, that I am a missionary.
[2421.72 --> 2424.72]  I am on mission to make disciples.
[2424.72 --> 2435.72]  So for us to live out this mission together, that is, you know, the, the mentality that Jesus is calling us to inhabit as a people.
[2435.72 --> 2438.72]  Well, now this leads us to the third question, the where.
[2438.72 --> 2441.72]  Where is Jesus calling us to go?
[2441.72 --> 2445.72]  And we see the answer to this in verse 19.
[2445.72 --> 2450.72]  Where he says, therefore, go and make disciples, where?
[2450.72 --> 2452.72]  All the nations.
[2452.72 --> 2456.72]  Go to the world beyond Galilee.
[2456.72 --> 2457.72]  Where they were, right?
[2457.72 --> 2459.72]  Go beyond Israel.
[2459.72 --> 2467.72]  You know, in the Old Testament, God said, my people were to be lifted up on a hill.
[2467.72 --> 2475.72]  They were to be people that all the nations would stream to, to see the glory of God, because they were to be distinct.
[2475.72 --> 2478.72]  They were to be strange, even.
[2478.72 --> 2480.72]  Unique of all the nations of the world.
[2480.72 --> 2490.72]  And that people would see them and see a people who knew God, who lived according to God's laws and ways.
[2490.72 --> 2495.72]  And that they would be attracted as this attractional model.
[2495.72 --> 2504.72]  And like a big magnet, all people were to be drawn in to worship the one true God who is dwelling in the midst of his people.
[2504.72 --> 2508.72]  But now, because of Israel failed, Jesus came.
[2508.72 --> 2510.72]  He came as the true king.
[2510.72 --> 2515.72]  And now in the gospel, Jesus says, my people are to go out.
[2515.72 --> 2519.72]  Not just to invite people in, but they are to scatter.
[2519.72 --> 2522.72]  They are to go everywhere out to the nations.
[2522.72 --> 2526.72]  And this word nations, here, it doesn't just mean nation state like we have today.
[2526.72 --> 2529.72]  We have Switzerland and France and Canada.
[2529.72 --> 2533.72]  No, here it means the nations is all peoples.
[2533.72 --> 2536.72]  All tongues, all tribes, all ethnic groups.
[2536.72 --> 2540.72]  Every sort of people without distinction in the entire world.
[2540.72 --> 2549.72]  And that no matter who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter how similar they are to you or how different they are from you.
[2549.72 --> 2558.72]  That there should be no social or racial or any sort of man-made barrier that would keep a disciple of Jesus from sharing the gospel with someone else.
[2558.72 --> 2564.72]  So Jesus says, don't stay here where it is comfortable and safe.
[2564.72 --> 2567.72]  Go to every city on the planet.
[2567.72 --> 2574.72]  Every tribe, every tongue, every nation in every place and in every time in history.
[2574.72 --> 2578.72]  Like that's a tall order, right?
[2578.72 --> 2582.72]  Or we can say, this is an ambitious, ambitious mission.
[2582.72 --> 2583.72]  Right?
[2583.72 --> 2585.72]  And so here, like think about it.
[2585.72 --> 2586.72]  Here is Jesus in Galilee.
[2586.72 --> 2587.72]  Where is Galilee?
[2587.72 --> 2588.72]  Northern Israel.
[2588.72 --> 2590.72]  It's not very significant.
[2590.72 --> 2591.72]  It's not very influential.
[2591.72 --> 2593.72]  It's kind of countryside.
[2593.72 --> 2602.72]  He's got 11 leaders who are not, they have proved to be very, you know, influential people themselves.
[2602.72 --> 2607.72]  And he says to them, the entire world is mine.
[2607.72 --> 2615.72]  That God the Father has given me people from all the nations of the world and I'm going to go and claim them through you.
[2615.72 --> 2617.72]  That is my plan.
[2617.72 --> 2618.72]  That is my plan.
[2618.72 --> 2622.72]  And you may think, well, that's a bit unrealistic.
[2622.72 --> 2628.72]  But we have the benefit now, 2,000 years later, of seeing what's happened since then.
[2628.72 --> 2629.72]  Right?
[2629.72 --> 2640.72]  That the church has grown from a group of 120 people, which is kind of the number it gives us in Acts chapter 1, to over 2 billion disciples in the world today.
[2640.72 --> 2650.72]  And as a church, we must have this understanding that the mission that Jesus gave to his disciples is why we exist.
[2650.72 --> 2656.72]  That we are participants in this global mission of making disciples.
[2656.72 --> 2665.72]  And so that means for us as a church and as individuals to ask the question, God, where are you calling us to go?
[2665.72 --> 2666.72]  Right?
[2666.72 --> 2672.72]  Here we are in Delta, British Columbia, and the year of our Lord, 2023.
[2672.72 --> 2675.72]  And God, what is the mission that you are giving us?
[2675.72 --> 2679.72]  Where, Lord, are you calling us to go?
[2679.72 --> 2688.72]  And Jesus says, I have other sheep that are not part of this fold, and I must bring them also.
[2688.72 --> 2698.72]  And the way that Jesus brings his sheep around the world into his pen, into his fold, is by sending us out.
[2698.72 --> 2705.72]  And he brings them in by our going out and telling people about the Good Shepherd.
[2705.72 --> 2708.72]  And so that's the where all the nations.
[2708.72 --> 2709.72]  So we have the who?
[2709.72 --> 2710.72]  Who?
[2710.72 --> 2711.72]  Disciples.
[2711.72 --> 2713.72]  What is the mission?
[2713.72 --> 2714.72]  Make disciples.
[2714.72 --> 2716.72]  Disciples making disciples.
[2716.72 --> 2717.72]  Where?
[2717.72 --> 2719.72]  All over the world.
[2719.72 --> 2720.72]  Everywhere.
[2720.72 --> 2722.72]  And so how?
[2722.72 --> 2724.72]  The fourth question is how.
[2724.72 --> 2727.72]  How then does Jesus make disciples of the nations?
[2727.72 --> 2729.72]  And this question is important.
[2729.72 --> 2737.72]  Because as a church, if we are to join Jesus in his mission, we need to know how he tells us to do this.
[2737.72 --> 2739.72]  How are we to make disciples?
[2739.72 --> 2742.72]  I read this interview this week.
[2742.72 --> 2749.72]  It was an interview with a pastor in Dallas, Texas, who was involved in revitalizing a church.
[2749.72 --> 2758.72]  And the interviewer was asking him about what was God doing in the church where he was serving.
[2758.72 --> 2767.72]  Because this church that very recently had seemed like it just was going to probably close its doors suddenly was growing like crazy.
[2767.72 --> 2769.72]  There were people coming into the church.
[2769.72 --> 2776.72]  People who had no church background at all coming and being baptized and becoming part of this church.
[2776.72 --> 2780.72]  And this is one comment he made.
[2780.72 --> 2782.72]  He said this.
[2782.72 --> 2792.72]  Every dying church in America has a community garden.
[2792.72 --> 2795.72]  Every dying church in America has a community garden.
[2795.72 --> 2796.72]  What do I mean by that?
[2796.72 --> 2798.72]  I have no problem with community gardens.
[2798.72 --> 2800.72]  A garden is a beautiful thing.
[2800.72 --> 2803.72]  But Jesus didn't tell us to start a community garden.
[2803.72 --> 2805.72]  He told us to make disciples.
[2805.72 --> 2808.72]  That's literally the mission of the church.
[2808.72 --> 2809.72]  The problem is not the gardens.
[2809.72 --> 2811.72]  I'm just saying this to be provocative.
[2811.72 --> 2822.72]  The problem is that we often want to substitute secondary or tertiary concerns for the primary concern of making disciples.
[2822.72 --> 2828.72]  You know, and if you have been part of the church for some time, you know what this is like.
[2828.72 --> 2829.72]  Right?
[2829.72 --> 2837.72]  And this happens to all kinds of churches in different places and in different times where every church that starts, it starts with excitement.
[2837.72 --> 2840.72]  When this church was started, it was exciting.
[2840.72 --> 2841.72]  I'm sure of it.
[2841.72 --> 2842.72]  Because it always is.
[2842.72 --> 2843.72]  Right?
[2843.72 --> 2845.72]  The church, people have bound together.
[2845.72 --> 2849.72]  They see a work of God that is happening in their midst.
[2849.72 --> 2858.72]  And then something happens later on at some point where the preservation of the church becomes more important than the mission of the church.
[2858.72 --> 2864.72]  And eventually, as the church grows, our energies turn from reaching out to maintaining.
[2864.72 --> 2868.72]  And in many ways, this is a natural progression.
[2868.72 --> 2873.72]  But that's why we must always be called to renewal.
[2873.72 --> 2879.72]  We must be called to remember our mission that Jesus calls his church to make disciples.
[2879.72 --> 2881.72]  That is our primary work.
[2881.72 --> 2890.72]  And Jesus says here that our primary, that this is done in two primary ways.
[2890.72 --> 2891.72]  Okay?
[2891.72 --> 2892.72]  This is how we make disciples.
[2892.72 --> 2896.72]  First, in verse 19, Jesus says,
[2896.72 --> 2899.72]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations.
[2899.72 --> 2900.72]  How?
[2900.72 --> 2905.72]  Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[2905.72 --> 2909.72]  Baptizing, of course, means the sacrament of baptism that we know,
[2909.72 --> 2912.72]  which is done at the beginning of a disciple's life.
[2912.72 --> 2913.72]  Right?
[2913.72 --> 2921.72]  So baptism is a sign and seal of being brought into the fellowship with the triune God and with the church.
[2921.72 --> 2929.72]  And so people are baptized, whether children or adults, at the start of their life of following Jesus.
[2929.72 --> 2934.72]  Baptism is the door through which we enter.
[2934.72 --> 2937.72]  But this means, of course, what does that mean?
[2937.72 --> 2942.72]  Well, it means that we have to have relationships with all kinds of people who are outside the church.
[2942.72 --> 2943.72]  Right?
[2943.72 --> 2948.72]  If baptism is the door through which they come into the church, for people to be baptized,
[2948.72 --> 2951.72]  we're going to have to reach out to people who are outside the church.
[2951.72 --> 2955.72]  If we are ever going to want to see people baptized.
[2955.72 --> 2960.72]  And we thank God that recently that we have had many adults baptized in our church.
[2960.72 --> 2970.72]  And that's happening because we have been reaching outside the community of the church and inviting people in to come and learn about who Jesus is.
[2970.72 --> 2975.72]  So first we make disciples by baptizing people, but that's not the only thing we do.
[2975.72 --> 2978.72]  Jesus goes on to verse 20 and he says,
[2978.72 --> 2982.72]  In teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[2982.72 --> 2993.72]  See, Christians are not called to just kind of win converts and sort of just chalk up a list of people who have heard the gospel and then responded to it.
[2993.72 --> 3000.72]  But to be a Christian, to be part of a church is a lifelong discipleship.
[3000.72 --> 3001.72]  Right?
[3001.72 --> 3008.72]  It's a lifelong apprenticeship with Jesus, our master, learning to do all that he commanded us.
[3008.72 --> 3022.72]  Learning his ways, listening to everything he has taught, becoming more and more like him in every way so that his life begins to push out all of the sin of our own lives.
[3022.72 --> 3033.72]  So when Jesus says, in teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you, it's about the truth of God going deeply into the lives of his people in every possible way.
[3033.72 --> 3037.72]  So a major part of our mission as a church is teaching.
[3037.72 --> 3041.72]  And I'm not just talking about sermons on Sunday.
[3041.72 --> 3042.72]  Right?
[3042.72 --> 3044.72]  It also happens through care groups.
[3044.72 --> 3046.72]  And it happens through Bible studies.
[3046.72 --> 3048.72]  And in Sunday school.
[3048.72 --> 3049.72]  Right?
[3049.72 --> 3052.72]  And in dinners and conversations that happen.
[3052.72 --> 3054.72]  It's happening all over the place.
[3054.72 --> 3059.72]  So Jesus says that the church that is on mission, it looks like this.
[3059.72 --> 3066.72]  It's where families, where individuals are being baptized.
[3066.72 --> 3072.72]  And it's where we are as a church devoted to the teachings of Jesus.
[3072.72 --> 3076.72]  So that we can learn how to live it out and apply it to every area of our lives.
[3076.72 --> 3079.72]  So that's how God makes disciples.
[3079.72 --> 3081.72]  And friends, that brings us to the last question.
[3081.72 --> 3082.72]  Why?
[3082.72 --> 3088.72]  Why should we care about this mission?
[3088.72 --> 3092.72]  And if you go back to verse 18, it says this.
[3092.72 --> 3097.72]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[3097.72 --> 3100.72]  Therefore, go.
[3100.72 --> 3101.72]  Right?
[3101.72 --> 3106.72]  Jesus says, I am fully and completely in charge of all things.
[3106.72 --> 3107.72]  Right?
[3107.72 --> 3112.72]  The sovereign over all creation has come to restore his creation, which has gone astray.
[3112.72 --> 3115.72]  And Jesus is saying, I am Lord of all.
[3115.72 --> 3116.72]  I am renewing all things.
[3116.72 --> 3119.72]  And I'm calling you, my church, to be a part of it.
[3119.72 --> 3125.72]  And when we hear that, we might think that sounds kind of scary.
[3125.72 --> 3128.72]  We might think that sounds kind of impossible.
[3128.72 --> 3131.72]  But listen to what Jesus says here.
[3131.72 --> 3139.72]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[3139.72 --> 3145.72]  That means that you and I can't open people's eyes to see who Jesus is.
[3145.72 --> 3151.72]  Now, when we, when Jesus sends us out to make disciples and we say, you know, this is a hard mission.
[3151.72 --> 3154.72]  I don't have this ability, right?
[3154.72 --> 3156.72]  To make disciples.
[3156.72 --> 3159.72]  We're acknowledging that, yes, we don't.
[3159.72 --> 3161.72]  We can't open people's eyes.
[3161.72 --> 3163.72]  We can't change anyone's hearts.
[3163.72 --> 3165.72]  But who can?
[3165.72 --> 3167.72]  Jesus.
[3167.72 --> 3170.72]  All authority in heaven and on earth is his.
[3170.72 --> 3172.72]  Jesus doesn't need us to make disciples.
[3172.72 --> 3173.72]  Right?
[3173.72 --> 3183.72]  He can call anyone he wants, anytime he wants, any way he wants, and they will drop everything immediately and follow him.
[3183.72 --> 3185.72]  He doesn't need us.
[3185.72 --> 3190.72]  But how amazing is it that he chooses to use us?
[3190.72 --> 3197.72]  And he says in verse 20, and surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[3197.72 --> 3198.72]  Right?
[3198.72 --> 3203.72]  Jesus is the king of the world and he sends us out into the world with the good news of the gospel.
[3203.72 --> 3206.72]  And he says, and I will be with you.
[3206.72 --> 3214.72]  You know, one of my favorite things to do in the summers when I was a kid is to go tubing down a river.
[3214.72 --> 3215.72]  That was near my house.
[3215.72 --> 3217.72]  So we drive down to the river.
[3217.72 --> 3219.72]  We grab our floaty tubes.
[3219.72 --> 3223.72]  You know, the floaty tubes, the inner, the circle inner tubes.
[3223.72 --> 3228.72]  And we go down under the bridge and we launch off into the river.
[3228.72 --> 3230.72]  And what would we do?
[3230.72 --> 3231.72]  We would just float.
[3231.72 --> 3232.72]  It's a hot summer day.
[3232.72 --> 3233.72]  The water was cool.
[3233.72 --> 3242.72]  We would float down the river on a gentle current, allowing us, allowing this river to just to carry us, to sweep us down.
[3242.72 --> 3244.72]  And we'd enjoy the ride as we went.
[3244.72 --> 3251.72]  And Jesus says in Matthew 16, 18, I will build my church.
[3251.72 --> 3254.72]  And the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[3254.72 --> 3257.72]  You know, friends, Jesus is building his church.
[3257.72 --> 3258.72]  Right?
[3258.72 --> 3265.72]  And how much fun is it that we get to grab a floaty tube, jump in the river of what he is doing to build his church,
[3265.72 --> 3269.72]  and just go with the current, following wherever the spirit leads.
[3269.72 --> 3272.72]  Jesus says, I am building my church.
[3272.72 --> 3276.72]  And you, my church, can enjoy the ride.
[3276.72 --> 3278.72]  Come with me.
[3278.72 --> 3280.72]  I will be with you.
[3280.72 --> 3284.72]  And so that means, Christians, we can be bold.
[3284.72 --> 3287.72]  We can take risks and be courageous.
[3287.72 --> 3290.72]  We can serve sacrificially.
[3290.72 --> 3299.72]  And we can do these things, not because God needs us, but because he allows us to participate in his great and glorious mission.
[3299.72 --> 3302.72]  So let's close in prayer and let's ask God to help us.
[3302.72 --> 3309.72]  Lord God, we lift up to you this compelling mission that Jesus has given us.
[3309.72 --> 3317.72]  We lift it up to you, Father, because even though you have called us to do it, we know that it is your work.
[3317.72 --> 3322.72]  In and through, and even sometimes in spite of us, your people.
[3322.72 --> 3330.72]  Father, we ask that as your people, we might together be renewed in our mission as a church to make disciples of the nations.
[3330.72 --> 3342.72]  And Father, we pray that we would bear fruit, the fruit that you have called us to bear, people baptized in your name, forgiven of their sins, trained in the ways of love.
[3342.72 --> 3349.72]  Lord, accomplish your mission in us and through us, because only you can do it.
[3349.72 --> 3351.72]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3351.72 --> 3354.72]  Amen.
[3355.72 --> 3356.72]  Let's stand.
[3356.72 --> 3359.72]  Let's sing our song of response together.
[3359.72 --> 3388.72]  Let's sing.
[3388.72 --> 3394.72]  Everyone needs compassion, love that's ever living.
[3394.72 --> 3399.72]  Let's sing for you.
[3399.72 --> 3401.72]  Everyone needs compassion, love that's ever living.
[3401.72 --> 3403.08]  with wishes
[3403.08 --> 3405.70]  by the Son of Savior
[3405.70 --> 3408.66]  from all
[3408.66 --> 3410.20]  nations
[3410.20 --> 3417.60]  Savior
[3417.60 --> 3419.34]  King and the
[3419.34 --> 3420.96]  mountains
[3420.96 --> 3423.64]  my God is mighty to
[3423.64 --> 3424.46]  save
[3424.46 --> 3427.60]  He is mighty to save
[3427.60 --> 3429.24]  forever
[3429.24 --> 3432.16]  of our salvation
[3432.16 --> 3433.90]  He was
[3433.90 --> 3436.00]  and all in the grave
[3436.00 --> 3439.28]  Jesus all in the grave
[3439.28 --> 3455.54]  So take me as you find me
[3455.54 --> 3457.90]  all my fears and fears
[3457.90 --> 3461.86]  Fill my life
[3461.86 --> 3463.66]  like a man
[3463.66 --> 3466.78]  Give my heart to follow
[3466.78 --> 3470.66]  Everything I believe in
[3470.66 --> 3474.60]  Now I surrender
[3474.60 --> 3481.98]  God is mighty to save
[3481.98 --> 3483.56]  He is mighty to save
[3483.56 --> 3486.76]  He is mighty to save
[3486.76 --> 3491.60]  He is mighty to save
[3491.60 --> 3492.86]  Forever
[3492.86 --> 3495.46]  Walker of salvation
[3495.46 --> 3497.40]  He doesn't walk to the grave
[3497.40 --> 3499.36]  Jesus walk to the grave
[3499.36 --> 3524.48]  all
[3529.36 --> 3530.56]  the whole world
[3530.56 --> 3531.66]  I see
[3531.66 --> 3533.20]  the glory
[3533.20 --> 3537.56]  of the risen King
[3537.56 --> 3539.92]  Savior
[3539.92 --> 3541.42]  He came
[3541.42 --> 3543.62]  of the mountains
[3543.62 --> 3545.72]  my God is mighty
[3545.72 --> 3546.98]  to save
[3546.98 --> 3550.42]  He is mighty to save
[3550.42 --> 3552.12]  forever
[3552.12 --> 3553.82]  on the earth
[3553.82 --> 3555.06]  salvation
[3555.06 --> 3557.60]  He rose and all
[3557.60 --> 3558.96]  the rain
[3558.96 --> 3559.80]  Jesus
[3559.80 --> 3562.24]  water the rain
[3562.24 --> 3564.00]  turn it on
[3564.00 --> 3564.76]  the hill
[3564.76 --> 3566.14]  of the whole world
[3566.14 --> 3567.20]  sing
[3567.20 --> 3568.64]  sing
[3568.64 --> 3570.16]  for the glory
[3570.16 --> 3573.06]  of the risen King
[3573.06 --> 3574.24]  Jesus
[3574.24 --> 3575.62]  shed a light
[3575.62 --> 3577.70]  and the whole world
[3577.70 --> 3578.86]  sing
[3578.86 --> 3579.64]  sing
[3579.64 --> 3581.70]  for the glory
[3581.70 --> 3583.86]  of the risen King
[3587.60 --> 3591.22]  you may be seated
[3591.22 --> 3601.64]  so we come now to the time
[3601.64 --> 3602.36]  where we
[3602.36 --> 3603.86]  we give
[3603.86 --> 3605.20]  our tithes and offerings
[3605.20 --> 3605.84]  as a
[3605.84 --> 3607.36]  as an act of worship
[3607.36 --> 3608.46]  to God
[3608.46 --> 3609.72]  and as a way to participate
[3609.72 --> 3611.52]  in the mission
[3611.52 --> 3612.44]  of His church
[3612.44 --> 3614.10]  so our designated offering
[3614.10 --> 3614.74]  for this Sunday
[3614.74 --> 3616.46]  is for reframe ministries
[3616.46 --> 3617.36]  and actually there should be
[3617.36 --> 3618.54]  an insert in your bulletin
[3618.54 --> 3619.90]  hopefully you had a chance
[3619.90 --> 3620.58]  to look at it
[3620.58 --> 3621.44]  that will tell you more
[3621.44 --> 3622.22]  about this ministry
[3622.22 --> 3624.10]  and so may I
[3624.10 --> 3625.52]  ask our
[3625.52 --> 3626.86]  deacon
[3626.86 --> 3628.66]  or whoever is going to be
[3628.66 --> 3629.76]  collecting the offering
[3629.76 --> 3631.08]  today to come forward
[3631.08 --> 3632.96]  from the other
[3637.06 --> 3637.48]   Oriental
[3637.48 --> 3638.56]   Oriental
[3638.56 --> 3653.56]  the Philokines
[3653.56 --> 3655.50]  Israel
[3655.50 --> 3657.50]  Amen.
[3685.50 --> 3687.50]  Amen.
[3715.50 --> 3717.50]  Amen.
[3745.50 --> 3747.50]  Amen.
[3775.50 --> 3777.50]  Amen.
[3805.50 --> 3807.50]  Amen.
[3835.50 --> 3852.50]  So, last week, Sunday, we had the opportunity to affirm folks who let their name stand for Elders as well as for Deakin.
[3852.50 --> 3864.50]  And as you saw in your bulletin, the three Elders were affirmed, and because it was only three Elders and we needed three Elders, they were automatically elected to that office.
[3864.50 --> 3866.50]  Today is a little bit different.
[3866.50 --> 3873.50]  We need one Deacon, and we have four folks who have been willing to let their name stand.
[3873.50 --> 3881.50]  So, in this church, it's been a custom to choose by lot.
[3881.50 --> 3883.50]  We choose by lot.
[3883.50 --> 3886.50]  We take a name out of a box, or a hat.
[3886.50 --> 3887.50]  In this case, it's a box.
[3887.50 --> 3896.50]  And we trust that the Lord will guide that process to a person who can, in this season, serve as Deacon.
[3896.50 --> 3902.50]  Before we choose a name, I think we ought to ask God for a blessing on the process.
[3902.50 --> 3910.50]  Lord, thank you for those who have been willing to let their name serve, capable members of this congregation.
[3910.50 --> 3913.50]  And we're so grateful.
[3913.50 --> 3919.50]  You bless us with leadership time and time again.
[3919.50 --> 3921.50]  And we're so grateful.
[3921.50 --> 3929.50]  Today, we are going to choose a Deacon from four who have let their name stand.
[3929.50 --> 3938.50]  And we pray that you will bless this process so this person can serve in this season of church leadership, too.
[3938.50 --> 3941.50]  So, bless us, Lord, for Jesus' sake.
[3941.50 --> 3942.50]  Amen.
[3942.50 --> 3957.50]  The name I drew is Edgar Wong.
[3957.50 --> 3958.50]  Okay.
[3958.50 --> 3961.50]  Edgar Wong will serve.
[3961.50 --> 3963.50]  And thank you to all who have let their name stand.
[3963.50 --> 3968.50]  We will pray about this in our congregational prayer, I think, asking or thanking the Lord.
[3972.50 --> 3973.50]  Thank you.
[3973.50 --> 3974.50]  Thank you.
[3974.50 --> 3975.50]  Thank you.
[3975.50 --> 3976.50]  Thank you.
[3976.50 --> 3977.50]  Thank you.
[3977.50 --> 3992.50]  Yeah, so let us come before the Lord now in this prayer of supplication, asking for the Lord just to reign over all the places where we call on him for help.
[3992.50 --> 3995.50]  And so let's pray together.
[3995.50 --> 4001.50]  Our Heavenly Father, holy is your name.
[4001.50 --> 4009.50]  Lord, we thank you that this morning you have called us as your people to gather, to worship you.
[4009.50 --> 4014.50]  And Lord, to learn again what it means to know you and follow you.
[4014.50 --> 4024.50]  And we confess that our thoughts of you, O Lord, have been often too small, have been too few.
[4024.50 --> 4031.50]  Not often we have recognized how you reign and exercise your authority over all creation.
[4031.50 --> 4038.50]  We recognize that there is no square inch of all creation over which you are not King and Lord.
[4038.50 --> 4052.50]  And even as your church and all of creation looks towards its liberation and its full redemption, the full implications of your deep lordship are yet to be revealed.
[4052.50 --> 4064.50]  Despite this, it is only right for us to acknowledge your dominion over all things and your desire to make yourself more fully known throughout all the earth.
[4064.50 --> 4072.50]  May you be lifted up, O Lord, in our lives, through our church, through our gatherings.
[4072.50 --> 4078.50]  May we walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have called us.
[4078.50 --> 4096.50]  And as the Apostle Peter tells us, we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for your own possession, whose purpose is that we might proclaim your excellencies.
[4096.50 --> 4101.50]  For you have called us out of darkness and into your marvelous light.
[4101.50 --> 4107.50]  You have called us to be a people who were once not a people, but who now are your people.
[4107.50 --> 4116.50]  A people who had once not received mercy, but now have received it through the atoning work of your son, who is now seated on his throne.
[4116.50 --> 4122.50]  And Lord, today we pray for those in our church family who are going through a season of hardship and suffering.
[4122.50 --> 4129.50]  You know our hearts and you know our lives better than we know them.
[4129.50 --> 4136.50]  And so we ask that you would bring these individuals and families a tangible sense of your comfort in your presence right now.
[4136.50 --> 4148.50]  And Lord, especially we pray this morning for Pat Bauman, who broke her arm this week in more than one place, and will have an operation this coming Wednesday.
[4148.50 --> 4158.50]  And Lord, we also pray for Jordan again, Lord, as he heads into a precautionary surgery.
[4158.50 --> 4164.50]  Lord, in order to make sure, Lord, that there is just no traces of cancer left.
[4164.50 --> 4171.50]  And Lord, would you be with him and Vanessa and the children in this time and be with Pat.
[4171.50 --> 4175.50]  Lord, be with others in our congregation who grieve.
[4175.50 --> 4178.50]  Lord, we think of Robin, who misses her mom.
[4178.50 --> 4187.50]  We think of those who struggle with chronic pain and who need your help, Lord.
[4187.50 --> 4190.50]  We think of Shirley and Grace and Aline.
[4190.50 --> 4200.50]  We think of, Lord, others, Lord, who we don't know, but who continue to, who need you.
[4200.50 --> 4203.50]  Lord, we pray that you would be with each of them now.
[4203.50 --> 4209.50]  And that the loving arms of our great shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ, would surround and comfort them.
[4209.50 --> 4212.50]  And may they know your presence in their adversity.
[4212.50 --> 4215.50]  We pray for your peace and strength.
[4215.50 --> 4223.50]  We pray, Lord, that the surgeries, especially being performed this week, would be effective and successful.
[4223.50 --> 4233.50]  We give thanks that grace and the peace of Christ gives us strength and is our anchor during all kinds of trials.
[4233.50 --> 4242.50]  We pray, Lord, that you would enable us to rest in the full assurance of your sovereignty over our lives.
[4242.50 --> 4245.50]  Father, we also pray for your mercy upon our land.
[4245.50 --> 4249.50]  We ask that the wildfires in Alberta would come to an end.
[4249.50 --> 4256.50]  Hear our prayers for those who have been affected by the fires, those being evacuated from their homes and businesses.
[4256.50 --> 4261.50]  Watch over them and keep them safe amidst the many challenges they're facing.
[4261.50 --> 4273.50]  Lord, we pray for the churches and other Christian organizations who are seeking to help those who are affected, that they might be a witness of your compassion and care for all who suffer.
[4273.50 --> 4280.50]  And Lord, we thank you for our church, Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[4280.50 --> 4286.50]  We thank you, Lord, for a membership who you have called together.
[4286.50 --> 4292.50]  And Lord, that you have gifted each in your own way.
[4292.50 --> 4297.50]  But Lord, all gifts that come from you, one spirit.
[4297.50 --> 4298.50]  Thank you for every once every day who you激メal of the church that cannot be Сов Way.
[4298.50 --> 4301.50]  And Lord, we thank you for the church to be with us and upon us.
[4301.50 --> 4304.50]  My exracise for the church.
[4304.50 --> 4310.50]  Lord, we thank you for some of Yourgestionون is a gift that Jesus used us for making of?
[4314.50 --> 4320.50]  handic turret Вам, not only love, but with other persons, as just as dari Saaries, as in my parents.
[4320.50 --> 4328.78]  for Edgar. We thank you, Lord, for their willingness to allow you to have this calling
[4328.78 --> 4334.96]  on their lives. And Lord, would you empower them with your grace and your wisdom that they might
[4334.96 --> 4344.16]  serve you by serving us, this congregation. And Lord, we pray, Lord, for our mission
[4344.16 --> 4351.36]  in Delta and in the world. Lord, that each one of us, Lord, that you would call and equip,
[4352.50 --> 4359.80]  Lord, to be your missionaries wherever you place each one of us. Lord, we look to you for all of
[4359.80 --> 4364.54]  these things because, Lord, you are sitting on your throne. You are the risen and the ascended, Lord.
[4366.26 --> 4372.46]  And you will come again to renew all things. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4374.16 --> 4376.54]  Let's stand.
[4379.94 --> 4386.54]  And after the benediction and we sing our final song, you are invited to a time of fellowship
[4386.54 --> 4393.76]  and coffee in the room right through the doors there. So I hope you will take a couple minutes
[4393.76 --> 4401.34]  to join us. I invite you to hold out your hands to receive God's blessing. May the grace of the
[4401.34 --> 4407.06]  Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now,
[4407.82 --> 4410.50]  today, and forever. Amen.
[4414.72 --> 4420.46]  The final phrase of this song, hand in hand, with souls set free, bind us, Lord, and use us, Lord.
[4420.46 --> 4425.34]  Oh, lead us, Lord, today. Continues the theme of the Great Commission.
[4425.34 --> 4446.36]  By your grace, we've been saved, we came to come. To you and by faith, one in heart, for you may be whole.
[4446.36 --> 4453.14]  Christ has peace and unity, love us now, and forever.
[4454.14 --> 4461.58]  Now your plan, with souls set free, bind us, Lord, and use us, Lord.
[4461.74 --> 4467.96]  We are dismissed.
[4467.96 --> 4468.52]  .
[4497.96 --> 4527.94]  Thank you.
