[0.00 → 15.38] Main
[30.00 → 31.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 61.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[300.00 → 302.00] Amen.
[330.00 → 331.00] Good morning, everyone.
[331.00 → 332.00] Good morning.
[332.00 → 334.84] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[334.84 → 338.76] We are glad that you have come, for whatever reason you've come.
[338.76 → 343.44] We all come for different reasons, but whatever the reason is, we believe that God has called
[343.44 → 348.40] each one of us to be here, to worship Him, to know Him, and love Him.
[348.40 → 354.78] Happy Father's Day to all the fathers in the room and those who celebrate, and most importantly,
[354.78 → 358.24] we all have a Heavenly Father who loves us.
[358.24 → 365.34] And so let's come before the Lord now as we pray, as we worship the Lord together, and
[365.34 → 372.04] to do so in a spirit that seeks to love Him more, to know His love for us, and to seek
[372.04 → 373.84] His word in our lives.
[373.84 → 378.96] So just one announcement I want to draw your attention to before we begin, and you may have
[378.96 → 386.00] seen it on the overhead here, that we are changing the start time of our worship service.
[386.00 → 387.82] So it's kind of a big deal.
[387.82 → 390.16] That will be in two weeks on July 2nd.
[390.16 → 393.50] We are moving the time a bit earlier to 10 o'clock.
[393.50 → 400.02] So please do take note of that and don't show up at 10.30 in two weeks.
[400.02 → 411.74] So this morning we humble our hearts before the Lord, and we stand here both triumphant
[411.74 → 416.24] and also relieved at God's rescue.
[416.24 → 421.20] Just like David was when he wrote this Psalm that we are going to say together here.
[421.20 → 426.88] So let's allow our praise for God not just to be in our hearts, but also to be on our lips,
[426.88 → 433.54] in our mouths, as we read this call to worship together from Psalm 34.
[433.54 → 435.88] Psalm 34.30 in three weeks.
[435.88 → 439.22] I will extol the Lord at all times.
[439.22 → 442.22] His praise will always be on my lips.
[442.22 → 443.88] I will glory in the Lord.
[443.88 → 446.88] Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
[446.88 → 450.06] Glorify the Lord with me.
[450.22 → 453.60] Let us exalt his name together.
[453.94 → 458.12] So please join me now as we come to our Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[458.36 → 459.70] Let's bow our heads and let's pray.
[459.70 → 465.10] Oh Lord, you are indeed the King of glory.
[466.00 → 474.92] You are exalted in the heavenly places, ruling over this world that you have created, ruling
[474.92 → 480.58] over your church that you have created and called to yourself, us, your people.
[481.34 → 488.44] And God, we praise you that you are a King that is good, that is just, all-wise, and all-knowing.
[489.70 → 495.80] We thank you that you are a King that always watches over us, that hears the cry of the
[495.80 → 496.38] afflicted.
[497.20 → 503.16] And Lord, you have sent your Holy Spirit to walk alongside of us.
[504.08 → 509.12] So God, this morning we ask that you would meet with us wherever, whatever we're bringing
[509.12 → 513.48] into this week, the joys and the sadnesses, the difficulties and the successes.
[514.26 → 519.58] Would you take those things and help us to bring them and lay them at your feet?
[519.70 → 521.86] We praise and honour you this day.
[521.98 → 527.80] Be among us, oh Lord, by your Holy Spirit and dwell our worship, that you would be glorified.
[528.34 → 529.76] It is in Jesus' name we pray.
[530.50 → 530.84] Amen.
[531.60 → 536.56] So brothers and sisters, I invite you to stand in body or in spirit as you are able for God's
[536.56 → 537.60] greeting to us this morning.
[538.70 → 540.56] From Psalm 34, verse 8.
[540.56 → 546.06] Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[546.80 → 549.26] Blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
[550.08 → 556.90] So as the Lord has called us, welcomed us, greeted us, let us also turn and greet one another
[556.90 → 559.64] as brothers and sisters in Christ, in the name of the Lord.
[559.64 → 573.24] Good one.
[573.24 → 575.20] Okay.
[577.06 → 581.56] Thank you.
[581.56 → 611.54] Thank you.
[611.56 → 641.54] Thank you.
[641.56 → 643.56] Thank you.
[671.56 → 673.56] Thank you.
[701.56 → 703.56] Thank you.
[731.56 → 733.56] Thank you.
[761.56 → 763.56] Thank you.
[763.56 → 765.56] Thank you.
[765.56 → 767.56] Thank you.
[767.56 → 769.56] Thank you.
[769.56 → 771.56] Thank you.
[771.56 → 773.56] Thank you.
[773.56 → 777.56] Thank you.
[777.56 → 779.56] Thank you.
[779.56 → 781.56] Thank you.
[781.56 → 783.56] Thank you.
[783.56 → 785.56] Thank you.
[785.56 → 790.56] Thank you.
[790.56 → 791.56] Thank you.
[791.56 → 793.56] Thank you.
[793.56 → 795.56] Thank you.
[795.56 → 797.56] Thank you.
[797.56 → 799.56] Thank you.
[799.56 → 801.56] Thank you.
[801.56 → 803.56] Thank you.
[803.56 → 805.56] Thank you.
[805.56 → 807.56] Thank you.
[807.56 → 809.56] Thank you.
[809.56 → 811.56] Thank you.
[811.56 → 813.56] Thank you.
[813.56 → 815.56] Thank you.
[815.56 → 817.56] Thank you.
[817.56 → 819.56] Thank you.
[819.56 → 831.32] on his heart, I know that while in heaven he stands, no tongue can bid me thence depart.
[831.32 → 836.56] No tongue can bid me thence depart.
[839.44 → 848.60] When Satan tempts me to despair, and tells me of the guilt within,
[848.60 → 858.22] upward I look and see him there, who made an end of all my sin.
[858.76 → 867.64] Because the sinless Saviour died, my sinful soul is counted free,
[867.64 → 877.00] for God the just is satisfied, to look on him and pardon me.
[877.00 → 882.00] To look on him and pardon me.
[884.62 → 893.30] Behold him there, a risen Lamb, my perfect spotless righteousness,
[893.30 → 902.92] the great unchangeable I am, the King of glory and of grace.
[902.92 → 912.98] But with himself I cannot die, my soul is purchased by his blood,
[912.98 → 921.92] but I visit with Christ on high, with Christ my Saviour and my God.
[921.92 → 941.30] Father, we love you, we worship and adore you.
[941.30 → 949.06] Glorify thy name in all the earth.
[951.46 → 956.78] Glorify thy name.
[956.92 → 960.92] Glorify thy name.
[960.92 → 964.48] Glorify thy name.
[964.48 → 965.42] Glorify thy name.
[965.42 → 971.80] Glorify thy name in all the earth.
[971.80 → 982.46] Jesus, we love you, we worship and adore you.
[983.12 → 990.64] Glorify our name in all the earth.
[990.64 → 1012.84] Glorify thy name in all the earth.
[1012.84 → 1024.00] Spirit, we love you, we worship and adore you.
[1024.76 → 1034.84] Glorify thy name in all the earth.
[1034.84 → 1040.46] Glorify thy name.
[1040.76 → 1046.06] Glorify thy name.
[1046.52 → 1057.72] Glorify thy name in all the earth.
[1057.72 → 1058.90] Thank you.
[1058.90 → 1059.52] You may be seated.
[1064.84 → 1068.24] Great singing, everyone.
[1070.38 → 1073.06] So we come now to our time of confession.
[1073.90 → 1081.00] And this time allows us to be honest with ourselves, with one another, and with our Heavenly Father.
[1081.00 → 1087.90] And to come before a God who is both holy and merciful.
[1090.08 → 1094.32] Seeking his forgiveness, seeking his pardon through Jesus Christ.
[1095.34 → 1102.14] So our scripture reading a bit later on here will talk about how the gospel comes to heal our hostility.
[1102.14 → 1109.78] It comes to tear down the walls that we build and put up that keep us from unity with one another.
[1110.64 → 1113.24] And so our prayer of confession today is on this theme.
[1114.04 → 1116.02] So please join me in this prayer of confession.
[1116.56 → 1120.34] And then we'll have a time for silent confession afterward.
[1120.34 → 1136.62] Father, who formed the human family to live in harmony and peace, we acknowledge before you our divisions, quarrels, hatreds, injustices, and greed.
[1136.62 → 1145.14] May your church demonstrate before the world the power of the gospel to destroy division,
[1145.14 → 1155.90] so that in Christ Jesus there may be no barriers of wealth or class, age or intellect, race or colour,
[1155.90 → 1166.16] but all may be equally your children, members one of another, and heirs together of your everlasting kingdom.
[1166.62 → 1172.50] And so let's come before our gracious and righteous God who is full of mercy
[1172.50 → 1177.32] and silently confess the ways we have sinned against him and against one another.
[1196.62 → 1210.12] Brothers and sisters, let's remember now his forgiveness by saying these words together.
[1210.12 → 1211.86] These words here on the screen.
[1211.86 → 1215.96] What can wash away our sins?
[1216.54 → 1218.84] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1219.40 → 1222.12] We are brothers and sisters through his blood.
[1222.98 → 1224.30] We have died together.
[1224.62 → 1226.14] We will rise together.
[1226.78 → 1228.20] We will live together.
[1228.70 → 1231.06] Please rise in body or in spirit as you are able
[1231.06 → 1235.24] as we hear the words of scripture that proclaim God's salvation.
[1235.36 → 1235.84] Please rise.
[1235.84 → 1246.50] In Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought nearby the blood of Christ.
[1246.50 → 1253.18] So then you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people
[1253.18 → 1255.20] and also members of his household.
[1255.76 → 1262.38] And in him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[1262.38 → 1265.00] So let's sing of God's grace together.
[1268.14 → 1272.86] A new song of response and focuses on the mercy and goodness of God,
[1273.50 → 1277.42] which has been our prayer and our focus the last few moments.
[1278.14 → 1286.04] So we invite you to learn this along with us as we share this song that focuses on the mercy
[1286.04 → 1290.12] and the goodness of God that we enjoy today and every day.
[1292.38 → 1312.00] I love you, Lord.
[1312.00 → 1326.82] All my days have been held in your hands.
[1326.82 → 1335.12] From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head.
[1335.12 → 1342.64] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1342.64 → 1350.64] All my life you have been faithful.
[1350.64 → 1350.88] All my life you have been faithful.
[1350.88 → 1359.94] All my life you have been so, so good.
[1359.94 → 1368.22] With every breath that I am able.
[1368.22 → 1373.90] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1373.90 → 1379.00] I love your voice
[1379.00 → 1383.64] You have led me through the fire
[1383.64 → 1388.02] In darkness light
[1388.02 → 1391.94] You are close like no other
[1391.94 → 1396.02] I've known you as a father
[1396.02 → 1400.46] I've known you as a friend
[1400.46 → 1408.48] I have lived in the goodness of God
[1408.48 → 1415.96] All my life you have been faithful
[1415.96 → 1425.48] All my life you have been so, so good
[1425.48 → 1431.18] With every breath that I am able
[1431.18 → 1439.50] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1439.50 → 1446.12] Your goodness is running after me
[1446.12 → 1449.20] It's running after me
[1449.20 → 1453.80] Your goodness is running after me
[1453.80 → 1456.96] It's running after me
[1456.96 → 1459.12] With my life laid down
[1459.12 → 1461.08] I surrender now
[1461.08 → 1463.50] I give you everything
[1463.50 → 1469.20] Your goodness is running after me
[1469.20 → 1472.24] It's running after me
[1472.24 → 1477.16] Your goodness is running after me
[1477.16 → 1479.74] It's running after me
[1479.74 → 1486.98] Your goodness is running after me
[1486.98 → 1492.20] With my life laid down, I'm so threatened now
[1492.20 → 1495.08] I give you everything
[1495.08 → 1500.36] Your goodness is running after me
[1500.36 → 1503.60] It's running after me
[1503.60 → 1511.66] All my life you have been faithful
[1511.66 → 1521.38] All my life you have been so, so good
[1521.38 → 1527.16] With every breath that I am able
[1527.16 → 1535.22] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1535.22 → 1544.22] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1544.22 → 1561.40] So at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their classes ages 3 through grade 5
[1574.22 → 1575.10] Wrong way
[1575.10 → 1581.02] Maybe they think it's children's message time
[1581.02 → 1583.40] All right
[1583.40 → 1587.32] So, long, long time ago
[1587.32 → 1589.46] In the summer of 2020
[1589.46 → 1593.64] We had begun a study in the book of Acts
[1593.64 → 1597.48] And we made it through to chapter 9
[1597.48 → 1598.70] We finished chapter 9
[1598.70 → 1600.64] And Acts has 28 chapters
[1600.86 → 1603.18] And so we made it about a third of the way through
[1603.18 → 1606.66] And so for this summer and into the fall
[1606.66 → 1609.50] What I want to do is actually jump back into the book of Acts
[1609.50 → 1612.38] And continue our study
[1612.38 → 1617.98] So before we read this text this morning in Acts chapter 10
[1617.98 → 1619.92] Let me remind you
[1619.92 → 1622.58] Since you probably don't remember
[1622.58 → 1624.32] And I had to look it up myself
[1624.32 → 1626.32] Where we are in Acts
[1626.32 → 1629.58] And what is going on in this narrative
[1629.58 → 1631.86] Of what God is doing
[1631.86 → 1634.62] So Acts is written by Luke
[1634.62 → 1638.28] Okay, Luke was not one of the first apostles
[1638.28 → 1642.10] But he was a person who came to faith
[1642.10 → 1644.08] And then travelled around with Paul
[1644.08 → 1645.38] And heard the gospel
[1645.38 → 1647.54] And observed all that God had done
[1647.54 → 1650.50] As he was travelling with Paul
[1650.50 → 1653.68] So Acts is written by Luke
[1653.68 → 1656.24] And it's actually a continuation of his gospel
[1656.24 → 1657.24] The Gospel of Luke
[1657.24 → 1659.90] It's all about what Jesus continued to do
[1659.90 → 1661.24] Through his church
[1661.24 → 1662.74] As the good news of the gospel
[1662.74 → 1663.96] Begins to spread
[1663.96 → 1665.76] It begins to go out from Jerusalem
[1665.76 → 1668.40] And then out into the ends of the world
[1668.40 → 1671.96] So chapter 1 begins with Jesus
[1671.96 → 1673.92] Having just risen from the dead
[1673.92 → 1676.48] And right before he ascends into heaven
[1676.48 → 1678.74] In Acts chapter 1 verse 8
[1678.74 → 1681.40] This is what he says to his disciples
[1681.40 → 1683.78] He says, but you will receive power
[1683.78 → 1685.32] When the Holy Spirit comes on you
[1685.32 → 1687.02] And you will be my witnesses
[1687.02 → 1688.18] In Jerusalem
[1688.18 → 1690.20] And all Judea and Samaria
[1690.20 → 1691.86] And to the ends of the earth
[1691.86 → 1693.84] And that is pretty much
[1693.84 → 1695.82] Then the outline of the book of Acts
[1695.82 → 1697.74] Because that's what begins to happen
[1697.74 → 1699.50] After the Holy Spirit is poured out
[1699.50 → 1701.24] On the day of Pentecost
[1701.24 → 1703.12] The message of the gospel
[1703.12 → 1704.58] Begins to spread
[1704.58 → 1706.80] Into all of Jerusalem
[1706.80 → 1709.08] And then into the neighbouring regions
[1709.08 → 1710.36] Of Judea and Samaria
[1710.36 → 1712.70] To non-Jewish peoples
[1712.70 → 1714.26] And then from there
[1714.26 → 1715.98] Out to all the nations
[1715.98 → 1717.10] To the ends of the earth
[1717.10 → 1718.92] And there's a turning point
[1718.92 → 1720.74] That happens in chapter 7
[1720.74 → 1723.02] Where Stephen
[1723.02 → 1725.32] Is stoned to death
[1725.32 → 1727.44] And he becomes the first Christian martyr
[1727.44 → 1729.92] And because of that persecution
[1729.92 → 1730.82] That begins
[1730.82 → 1734.68] The Christians leave Jerusalem
[1734.68 → 1735.34] And they scatter
[1735.34 → 1736.74] And then because of that
[1736.74 → 1738.06] They start taking the gospel
[1738.06 → 1739.64] Outside of Jerusalem
[1739.64 → 1741.36] So then in chapter 8
[1741.36 → 1742.18] You have Philip
[1742.18 → 1743.16] Bringing the gospel
[1743.16 → 1744.62] To the Samaritans
[1744.62 → 1745.58] And then particularly
[1745.58 → 1747.32] To the Ethiopian eunuchs
[1747.32 → 1749.02] And in chapter 9
[1749.02 → 1750.68] You have the conversion of Saul
[1750.68 → 1753.80] So that is a quick rewind
[1753.80 → 1755.88] And now that we pick up
[1755.88 → 1757.68] The story in Acts chapter 10
[1757.68 → 1760.72] With the story of Peter
[1760.72 → 1762.62] And we're going to begin to see
[1762.62 → 1763.98] How the gospel starts
[1763.98 → 1765.04] To move out
[1765.04 → 1767.20] Into all of these various cities
[1767.20 → 1768.82] Around the Mediterranean world
[1768.82 → 1770.80] And so we're asking
[1770.80 → 1772.16] What happens when the gospel
[1772.16 → 1773.74] Comes to all these various places?
[1774.80 → 1775.46] And so this morning
[1775.46 → 1776.00] We're going to see
[1776.00 → 1777.06] What happens when the gospel
[1777.06 → 1778.80] Comes to Caesarea
[1778.80 → 1780.64] Okay, so there's a map
[1780.64 → 1783.36] I want to draw our attention to
[1783.36 → 1784.92] And so you can see on the map
[1784.92 → 1786.12] Oh, I can see it too actually
[1786.12 → 1788.02] It's kind of small
[1788.02 → 1790.90] But you see in the lower down
[1790.90 → 1792.32] You see the city of Jerusalem
[1792.32 → 1793.92] Right, you all see Jerusalem?
[1794.60 → 1796.42] Okay, and then you see
[1796.42 → 1798.06] There's the Mediterranean Sea there
[1798.06 → 1799.80] And then there are two cities
[1799.80 → 1800.64] That are important
[1800.64 → 1801.96] For our story this morning
[1801.96 → 1804.10] Joppa and Caesarea
[1804.10 → 1807.66] So we're looking at a story
[1807.66 → 1809.90] Where Peter goes from Joppa
[1809.90 → 1812.40] Up the coast to Caesarea
[1812.40 → 1814.24] In Caesarea there's a man
[1814.24 → 1815.98] By the name of Cornelius
[1815.98 → 1817.84] And so Peter's in Joppa
[1817.84 → 1818.96] And do you know
[1818.96 → 1820.12] Anybody know where modern day
[1820.12 → 1821.48] What modern day Joppa is?
[1822.56 → 1823.24] Tel Aviv
[1823.24 → 1823.90] That's right
[1823.90 → 1825.58] So it's modern day Tel Aviv
[1825.58 → 1828.14] And then he travels up to Caesarea
[1828.14 → 1828.78] And Caesarea
[1828.78 → 1831.88] Is built by King Herod
[1831.88 → 1832.58] Herod the Great
[1832.58 → 1833.96] As a Roman city
[1833.96 → 1835.52] And he built himself there
[1835.52 → 1836.74] A royal palace
[1836.74 → 1838.24] And so it was a base
[1838.24 → 1840.16] From which he ruled Judea
[1840.16 → 1842.90] So there were a lot
[1842.90 → 1844.10] Of Roman soldiers there
[1844.10 → 1845.40] So then it's therefore
[1845.40 → 1846.32] Not surprising
[1846.32 → 1848.50] That that is where Cornelius is
[1848.50 → 1850.00] Because Cornelius
[1850.00 → 1851.50] Is a Roman centurion
[1851.50 → 1852.86] Which means he commanded
[1852.86 → 1853.64] A hundred soldiers
[1853.64 → 1855.74] So he was like a captain
[1855.74 → 1856.30] Of an army
[1856.30 → 1857.40] He had his hundred men
[1857.40 → 1859.40] That he was responsible for
[1859.40 → 1861.32] So that's who we find
[1861.32 → 1862.26] In Acts chapter 10
[1862.26 → 1863.38] Peter and Cornelius
[1863.38 → 1864.50] And that's what we're going
[1864.50 → 1865.20] To read about
[1865.20 → 1866.74] Right now
[1866.74 → 1868.14] Okay, so that was all
[1868.14 → 1869.24] An introduction
[1869.24 → 1870.40] So I'm going to invite
[1870.40 → 1871.36] Tony
[1871.36 → 1873.04] And it's his birthday
[1873.04 → 1875.08] Happy birthday
[1875.08 → 1877.92] So on this special day
[1877.92 → 1878.80] He has the privilege
[1878.80 → 1880.04] Of reading God's word
[1880.04 → 1881.18] For us
[1881.18 → 1889.80] So this reading is
[1889.80 → 1890.50] As you know then
[1890.50 → 1891.80] From Acts chapter 10
[1891.80 → 1893.06] If you want to follow along
[1893.06 → 1893.60] In the Bible
[1893.60 → 1894.78] That's on page
[1894.78 → 1896.06] 818
[1896.06 → 1899.36] At Caesarea
[1899.36 → 1900.10] There was a man
[1900.10 → 1901.10] Named Cornelius
[1901.10 → 1902.54] A centurion
[1902.54 → 1903.66] In what was known
[1903.66 → 1905.20] As the Italian regiment
[1905.20 → 1907.64] He and all his family
[1907.64 → 1908.38] Were devout
[1908.38 → 1909.56] And God-fearing
[1909.56 → 1911.56] He gave generously
[1911.56 → 1913.06] To those in need
[1913.06 → 1914.08] And prayed to God
[1914.08 → 1914.88] Regularly
[1914.88 → 1916.80] One day
[1916.80 → 1917.54] At about three
[1917.54 → 1918.40] In the afternoon
[1918.40 → 1919.66] He had a vision
[1919.66 → 1922.82] He distinctly saw
[1922.82 → 1924.02] An angel of God
[1924.02 → 1925.08] Who came to him
[1925.08 → 1925.66] And said
[1925.66 → 1926.88] Cornelius
[1926.88 → 1929.46] Cornelius stared
[1929.46 → 1930.32] At him in fear
[1930.32 → 1932.18] What is it Lord?
[1932.64 → 1933.22] He asked
[1933.22 → 1935.44] The angel answered
[1935.44 → 1936.66] Your prayers
[1936.66 → 1938.14] And gifts to the poor
[1938.14 → 1938.98] Have come up
[1938.98 → 1940.86] As a memorial offering
[1940.86 → 1941.66] Before God
[1941.66 → 1943.82] Now send men
[1943.82 → 1944.46] To Joppa
[1944.46 → 1945.22] To bring back
[1945.22 → 1946.24] A man named Simon
[1946.24 → 1948.12] Who is called Peter
[1948.12 → 1949.86] He is staying
[1949.86 → 1951.20] With Simon the Tanner
[1951.20 → 1952.46] Whose house
[1952.46 → 1953.52] Is by the sea
[1953.52 → 1956.24] When the angel
[1956.24 → 1957.02] Who spoke to him
[1957.02 → 1957.56] Had gone
[1957.56 → 1959.38] Cornelius called
[1959.38 → 1960.40] Two of his servants
[1960.40 → 1961.70] And a devout soldier
[1961.70 → 1962.38] Who was one
[1962.38 → 1963.52] Of his attendants
[1963.52 → 1965.28] He told them
[1965.28 → 1965.70] Everything
[1965.70 → 1966.86] That had happened
[1966.86 → 1968.22] And sent them
[1968.22 → 1968.86] To Joppa
[1968.86 → 1970.40] At about noon
[1970.40 → 1971.30] The following day
[1971.30 → 1971.86] As they were
[1971.86 → 1972.64] On their journey
[1972.64 → 1973.82] And approaching
[1973.82 → 1974.36] The city
[1974.36 → 1976.14] Peter went up
[1976.14 → 1977.00] On the roof
[1977.00 → 1977.54] To pray
[1977.54 → 1981.22] He became hungry
[1981.22 → 1982.52] And wanted something
[1982.52 → 1983.00] To eat
[1983.00 → 1984.12] And while the meal
[1984.12 → 1985.04] Was being prepared
[1985.04 → 1987.26] He fell into a trance
[1987.26 → 1989.64] He saw heaven opened
[1989.64 → 1990.76] And something like
[1990.76 → 1992.20] A large sheet
[1992.20 → 1993.42] Being let down
[1993.42 → 1993.86] To earth
[1993.86 → 1995.12] By its four corners
[1995.12 → 1997.50] It contained all kinds
[1997.50 → 1999.00] Of four footed animals
[1999.00 → 2001.18] As well as reptiles
[2001.18 → 2002.30] And birds
[2002.30 → 2004.26] Then a voice
[2004.26 → 2004.80] Told him
[2004.80 → 2006.02] Get up
[2006.02 → 2006.48] Peter
[2006.48 → 2007.48] Kill
[2007.48 → 2008.66] And eat
[2008.66 → 2011.56] Surely not
[2011.56 → 2012.00] Lord
[2012.00 → 2013.02] Peter replied
[2013.02 → 2014.56] I have never
[2014.56 → 2015.58] Eaten anything
[2015.58 → 2016.18] Impure
[2016.18 → 2017.60] Or unclean
[2017.60 → 2019.74] The voice
[2019.74 → 2020.40] Spoke to him
[2020.40 → 2021.22] A second time
[2021.22 → 2023.00] Do not call
[2023.00 → 2024.18] Anything impure
[2024.18 → 2025.30] That God
[2025.30 → 2026.32] Has made clean
[2026.32 → 2028.70] This happened
[2028.70 → 2029.50] Three times
[2029.50 → 2030.74] And immediately
[2030.74 → 2031.58] The sheet
[2031.58 → 2032.58] Was taken back
[2032.58 → 2033.10] To heaven
[2033.10 → 2036.48] While Peter
[2036.48 → 2037.12] Was wondering
[2037.12 → 2038.14] About the meaning
[2038.14 → 2038.78] Of the vision
[2038.78 → 2040.32] The men sent
[2040.32 → 2041.16] By Cornelius
[2041.16 → 2041.80] Found out
[2041.80 → 2042.86] Where Simon's house
[2042.86 → 2044.36] Was and stopped
[2044.36 → 2045.18] At the gate
[2045.18 → 2046.92] They called out
[2046.92 → 2048.28] Asking if Simon
[2048.28 → 2049.12] Who was known
[2049.12 → 2049.74] As Peter
[2049.74 → 2051.16] Was staying there
[2051.16 → 2052.98] While Peter
[2052.98 → 2053.82] Was still thinking
[2053.82 → 2054.62] About the vision
[2054.62 → 2056.08] The spirit
[2056.08 → 2056.78] Said to him
[2056.78 → 2057.60] Simon
[2057.60 → 2058.88] Three men
[2058.88 → 2059.46] Are looking
[2059.46 → 2059.98] For you
[2059.98 → 2061.58] So get up
[2061.58 → 2062.66] And go downstairs
[2062.66 → 2064.44] Do not hesitate
[2064.44 → 2065.38] To go with them
[2065.38 → 2067.12] For I have sent them
[2067.12 → 2069.12] Peter went down
[2069.12 → 2070.10] And said to the men
[2070.10 → 2071.32] I'm the one
[2071.32 → 2072.14] You're looking for
[2072.14 → 2073.62] Why have you come
[2073.62 → 2076.22] The men replied
[2076.22 → 2076.86] We have come
[2076.86 → 2077.86] From Cornelius
[2077.86 → 2078.88] The centurion
[2078.88 → 2080.48] He is a righteous
[2080.48 → 2081.86] And God-fearing man
[2081.86 → 2083.32] Who is respected
[2083.32 → 2084.86] By all the Jewish people
[2084.86 → 2086.80] A holy angel
[2086.80 → 2088.06] Told him to ask you
[2088.06 → 2089.32] To come to his house
[2089.32 → 2090.96] So that he could hear
[2090.96 → 2092.48] What you have to say
[2092.48 → 2095.52] Then Peter invited
[2095.52 → 2096.56] The men into the house
[2096.56 → 2097.46] To be his guests
[2097.46 → 2098.94] The next day
[2098.94 → 2100.20] Peter started out
[2100.20 → 2100.64] With them
[2100.64 → 2101.96] And some of the believers
[2101.96 → 2103.44] From Joppa
[2103.44 → 2104.30] Went along
[2104.30 → 2106.00] The following day
[2106.00 → 2107.92] He arrived in Caesarea
[2107.92 → 2111.16] Cornelius was expecting them
[2111.16 → 2112.18] And had called together
[2112.18 → 2113.02] His relatives
[2113.02 → 2114.28] And close friends
[2114.28 → 2116.38] As Peter entered the house
[2116.38 → 2118.08] Cornelius met him
[2118.08 → 2119.16] And fell at his feet
[2119.16 → 2119.94] In reverence
[2119.94 → 2122.08] But Peter made him get up
[2122.08 → 2123.50] Stand up
[2123.50 → 2123.96] He said
[2123.96 → 2125.58] I'm only a man myself
[2125.58 → 2128.06] While talking with him
[2128.06 → 2129.60] Peter went inside
[2129.60 → 2131.14] And found a large gathering
[2131.14 → 2131.74] Of people
[2131.74 → 2133.38] He said to them
[2133.38 → 2135.08] You are well aware
[2135.08 → 2137.12] That it is against our law
[2137.12 → 2137.88] For a Jew
[2137.88 → 2139.16] To associate with
[2139.16 → 2140.72] Or visit a Gentile
[2140.72 → 2143.30] But God has shown me
[2143.30 → 2144.54] That I should not call
[2144.54 → 2145.66] Anyone impure
[2145.66 → 2147.24] Or unclean
[2147.24 → 2150.12] Then Peter began to speak
[2150.12 → 2151.78] I now realize
[2151.78 → 2152.82] How true it is
[2152.82 → 2154.20] That God does not
[2154.20 → 2155.32] Show favouritism
[2155.32 → 2156.98] But accepts from
[2156.98 → 2157.86] Every nation
[2157.86 → 2159.58] The one who fears him
[2159.58 → 2161.00] And does what is right
[2161.00 → 2163.02] You know the message
[2163.02 → 2164.24] God sent to the people
[2164.24 → 2164.80] Of Israel
[2164.80 → 2166.56] Announcing the good news
[2166.56 → 2167.42] Of peace through
[2167.42 → 2168.32] Jesus Christ
[2168.32 → 2170.08] Who is Lord of all
[2170.08 → 2172.04] You know what has happened
[2172.04 → 2173.08] Throughout the province
[2173.08 → 2173.84] Of Judea
[2173.84 → 2175.46] Beginning in Galilee
[2175.46 → 2176.78] After the baptism
[2176.78 → 2178.02] That John preached
[2178.02 → 2179.80] All the prophets
[2179.80 → 2181.10] Testify about him
[2181.10 → 2182.32] That everyone
[2182.32 → 2183.38] Who believes in him
[2183.38 → 2184.92] Receives forgiveness
[2184.92 → 2185.68] Of sins
[2185.68 → 2186.46] Through his name
[2186.46 → 2188.58] While Peter was still
[2188.58 → 2189.66] Speaking these words
[2189.66 → 2191.30] The Holy Spirit
[2191.30 → 2192.24] Came on all
[2192.24 → 2193.24] Who heard the message
[2193.24 → 2195.44] The circumcised believers
[2195.44 → 2196.60] Who had come with Peter
[2196.60 → 2197.64] Were astonished
[2197.64 → 2199.02] That the gift
[2199.02 → 2200.06] Of the Holy Spirit
[2200.06 → 2201.02] Had been poured out
[2201.02 → 2202.56] Even on the Gentiles
[2202.56 → 2204.72] For they heard them
[2204.72 → 2205.68] Speaking in tongues
[2205.68 → 2207.08] And praising God
[2207.08 → 2208.64] Then Peter said
[2208.64 → 2209.70] Surely no one
[2209.70 → 2210.78] Can stand in the way
[2210.78 → 2211.92] Of their being baptized
[2211.92 → 2212.76] With water
[2212.76 → 2214.46] They have received
[2214.46 → 2215.36] The Holy Spirit
[2215.36 → 2216.68] Just as we have
[2216.68 → 2218.50] So he ordered
[2218.50 → 2219.54] That they be baptized
[2219.54 → 2221.32] In the name of Jesus Christ
[2221.32 → 2223.20] Then they asked Peter
[2223.20 → 2224.08] To stay with them
[2224.08 → 2225.62] For a few days
[2225.62 → 2227.22] This is the word
[2227.22 → 2227.72] Of the Lord
[2227.72 → 2229.48] Thanks be to God
[2229.48 → 2239.28] All right
[2239.28 → 2241.24] Let's pray together
[2241.24 → 2246.28] Holy Spirit
[2246.28 → 2248.60] Would you fall on us
[2248.60 → 2250.58] As you fell
[2250.58 → 2251.68] On those Gentiles
[2251.68 → 2252.58] In Caesarea
[2252.58 → 2254.58] Would you open our eyes
[2254.58 → 2255.20] Our hearts
[2255.20 → 2255.96] Our minds
[2255.96 → 2258.12] To believe in you
[2258.12 → 2259.04] And to worship you
[2259.04 → 2260.40] And we pray in Jesus name
[2260.40 → 2261.04] Amen
[2261.04 → 2265.04] So in 1914
[2265.04 → 2267.34] A poet
[2267.34 → 2268.52] By the name of
[2268.52 → 2269.62] Robert Frost
[2269.62 → 2270.46] Penned a poem
[2270.46 → 2272.20] Called Mending Wall
[2272.20 → 2273.34] Mending Wall
[2273.34 → 2274.86] In the poem
[2274.86 → 2276.72] Frost starts the poem
[2276.72 → 2278.06] By saying
[2278.06 → 2279.20] This
[2279.20 → 2280.32] And we have it here
[2280.32 → 2282.12] The very first line
[2282.12 → 2282.94] Of the poem says
[2282.94 → 2284.40] Something there is
[2284.40 → 2285.94] That doesn't love a wall
[2285.94 → 2287.64] Right
[2287.64 → 2288.04] There's something
[2288.04 → 2289.26] That doesn't like walls
[2289.26 → 2290.72] And the walls
[2290.72 → 2291.46] He's talking about
[2291.46 → 2293.10] Are these stone walls
[2293.10 → 2293.88] You can kind of see them
[2293.88 → 2295.16] In that picture there
[2295.16 → 2296.84] And there are these stone walls
[2296.84 → 2297.46] That you find
[2297.46 → 2298.70] All over New England
[2298.70 → 2299.50] Where I grew up
[2299.50 → 2300.60] And they were built
[2300.60 → 2302.68] To separate people's land
[2302.68 → 2303.84] As fences
[2303.84 → 2305.28] And so when I was a kid
[2305.28 → 2306.02] Growing up in Vermont
[2306.02 → 2307.24] As I went hiking
[2307.24 → 2308.20] Or walking in the woods
[2308.20 → 2309.68] You would see these stone walls
[2309.68 → 2310.90] And they were quite common
[2310.90 → 2313.16] And so without really knowing
[2313.16 → 2315.78] How the stones
[2315.78 → 2316.84] Throughout the year
[2316.84 → 2318.56] Would kind of just fall off
[2318.56 → 2320.18] The top of the wall
[2320.18 → 2321.68] And the wall would become
[2321.68 → 2322.74] In disrepair
[2322.74 → 2324.68] And so in the springtime
[2324.68 → 2325.44] After the winter
[2325.44 → 2326.00] And the thaw
[2326.00 → 2327.62] They would have to go out
[2327.62 → 2329.14] And fix the walls
[2329.14 → 2330.08] And take all those stones
[2330.08 → 2331.10] That kind of rolled off
[2331.10 → 2332.50] And stick them back on
[2332.50 → 2334.28] And so in the poem
[2334.28 → 2336.66] He talks about
[2336.66 → 2338.76] Going to call his neighbour
[2338.76 → 2340.38] To fix the wall
[2340.38 → 2342.18] So here's what it says
[2342.18 → 2343.22] In part of the poem
[2343.22 → 2345.62] He says this
[2345.62 → 2348.10] I let my neighbour know
[2348.10 → 2349.08] Beyond the hill
[2349.08 → 2351.30] And on a day we meet
[2351.30 → 2352.32] To walk the line
[2352.32 → 2353.78] And set the wall
[2353.78 → 2355.06] Between us once again
[2355.06 → 2356.50] We keep the wall
[2356.50 → 2357.34] Between us
[2357.34 → 2358.48] As we go
[2358.48 → 2360.74] You know
[2360.74 → 2361.44] That's kind of what's
[2361.44 → 2362.40] Happening in the picture there
[2362.40 → 2364.34] So
[2364.34 → 2367.84] So they're going along
[2367.84 → 2368.72] They're fixing the wall
[2368.72 → 2370.40] Replacing the stones
[2370.40 → 2371.28] That have rolled off
[2371.28 → 2373.02] And then they come
[2373.02 → 2373.94] To a place
[2373.94 → 2374.78] Along the wall
[2374.78 → 2375.96] Where there's really
[2375.96 → 2376.92] No reason for a wall
[2376.92 → 2377.50] To be there
[2377.50 → 2378.96] And he says something
[2378.96 → 2379.58] Kind of funny
[2379.58 → 2381.56] Listen to what he says
[2381.56 → 2382.26] Here in the next
[2382.26 → 2383.16] The next part
[2383.16 → 2385.46] There
[2385.46 → 2386.66] Where it is
[2386.66 → 2387.94] We do not need the wall
[2387.94 → 2389.88] He is all pine
[2389.88 → 2391.08] And I am apple orchard
[2391.08 → 2393.00] My apples will never
[2393.00 → 2393.66] Get across
[2393.66 → 2394.56] And eat the cones
[2394.56 → 2395.66] Under his pines
[2395.66 → 2396.24] I tell him
[2396.24 → 2398.12] He only says
[2398.12 → 2399.46] Good fences
[2399.46 → 2401.72] Make good neighbours
[2401.72 → 2404.54] So there are two phrases
[2404.54 → 2405.86] In the poem
[2405.86 → 2407.46] That are repeated twice
[2407.46 → 2409.58] The phrases are this
[2409.58 → 2411.02] Something there is
[2411.02 → 2412.32] That doesn't love a wall
[2412.32 → 2414.72] And good friends
[2414.72 → 2415.82] Make good neighbours
[2415.82 → 2417.96] And those two phrases
[2417.96 → 2418.78] I believe
[2418.78 → 2419.84] Capture
[2419.84 → 2421.62] What is going on
[2421.62 → 2423.12] In Acts chapter 10
[2423.12 → 2424.30] You see
[2424.30 → 2425.36] Those two phrases
[2425.36 → 2425.94] Capture
[2425.94 → 2426.90] The reality
[2426.90 → 2428.10] That we all live in
[2428.10 → 2429.90] That we are constantly
[2429.90 → 2431.48] Building walls
[2431.48 → 2432.60] Between ourselves
[2432.60 → 2433.64] And our neighbours
[2433.64 → 2434.70] You know
[2434.70 → 2435.78] And maybe we think
[2435.78 → 2437.00] It's a good thing
[2437.00 → 2439.38] It's good to have these walls
[2439.38 → 2441.06] That keep us apart
[2441.06 → 2443.12] And that we
[2443.12 → 2444.22] Because of these walls
[2444.22 → 2445.34] We kind of keep the peace
[2445.34 → 2446.52] We can live together
[2446.52 → 2448.24] And so we say
[2448.24 → 2448.90] Things like
[2448.90 → 2449.60] Good fences
[2449.60 → 2450.98] Make good neighbours
[2450.98 → 2452.72] But what we see
[2452.72 → 2453.40] In this passage
[2453.40 → 2455.08] Is that there is something
[2455.08 → 2456.40] That doesn't love a wall
[2456.40 → 2457.98] And that something
[2457.98 → 2458.62] Friends
[2458.62 → 2459.74] Is the gospel
[2459.74 → 2461.40] The gospel
[2461.40 → 2463.06] Doesn't put up fences
[2463.06 → 2463.94] The gospel
[2463.94 → 2464.70] Tears them down
[2464.70 → 2466.00] The gospel
[2466.00 → 2467.04] Doesn't build walls
[2467.04 → 2467.72] The gospel
[2467.72 → 2468.24] Takes
[2468.24 → 2469.86] It builds community
[2469.86 → 2470.62] And it takes
[2470.62 → 2471.54] Neighbours
[2471.54 → 2472.82] And it makes them
[2472.82 → 2473.84] Into family
[2473.84 → 2476.14] And that is what
[2476.14 → 2477.30] Peter and Cornelius
[2477.30 → 2478.16] Experienced
[2478.16 → 2478.96] First hand
[2478.96 → 2480.12] Two thousand years ago
[2480.12 → 2482.10] And our question
[2482.10 → 2482.90] Today is
[2482.90 → 2484.34] Have you experienced
[2484.34 → 2485.24] That in your life?
[2485.24 → 2486.94] So this morning
[2486.94 → 2488.04] I want to look at this passage
[2488.04 → 2489.44] Just under those two phrases
[2489.44 → 2491.40] That we get from this poem
[2491.40 → 2493.02] Mending walls
[2493.02 → 2494.80] Good fences make good neighbours
[2494.80 → 2495.38] And then
[2495.38 → 2496.46] Something there is
[2496.46 → 2497.84] That doesn't love a wall
[2497.84 → 2498.80] Okay so first
[2498.80 → 2501.34] Good friends make good neighbours
[2501.34 → 2502.10] In quotes
[2502.10 → 2502.62] Right
[2502.62 → 2504.32] So we're going to ask
[2504.32 → 2505.52] Who are the two neighbours
[2505.52 → 2506.36] In our passage
[2506.36 → 2508.32] And what is this fence
[2508.32 → 2509.96] That is separating them?
[2510.44 → 2511.12] So first
[2511.12 → 2511.86] The first neighbour
[2511.86 → 2513.16] That is introduced to us
[2513.16 → 2514.26] Is Cornelius
[2514.26 → 2515.70] So let's read again
[2515.70 → 2516.28] What it says
[2516.28 → 2517.06] Beginning in
[2517.06 → 2518.18] Verse 1
[2518.18 → 2519.94] At Caesarea
[2519.94 → 2520.66] There was a man
[2520.66 → 2521.46] Named Cornelius
[2521.46 → 2522.48] A centurion
[2522.48 → 2523.16] In what was known
[2523.16 → 2524.24] As the Italian regiment
[2524.24 → 2525.70] He
[2525.70 → 2527.84] And all his family
[2527.84 → 2528.84] Were devout
[2528.84 → 2530.04] God-fearing
[2530.04 → 2532.12] He gave generously
[2532.12 → 2533.10] To those in need
[2533.10 → 2534.60] He prayed to God
[2534.60 → 2536.12] Regularly
[2536.12 → 2538.30] So Cornelius here
[2538.30 → 2539.64] Is shown to be
[2539.64 → 2541.92] A very remarkable man
[2541.92 → 2543.70] He's a centurion
[2543.70 → 2545.54] He has authority
[2545.54 → 2546.86] Over many people
[2546.86 → 2548.82] But the remarkable thing
[2548.82 → 2549.72] About Cornelius
[2549.72 → 2550.58] For the purposes
[2550.58 → 2551.44] Of our story
[2551.44 → 2552.56] Is that he
[2552.56 → 2554.06] Is a Gentile
[2554.06 → 2555.62] He is not a Jew
[2555.62 → 2557.48] And yet
[2557.48 → 2558.80] He's devout
[2558.80 → 2560.54] And God-fearing
[2560.54 → 2562.66] He prays continually
[2562.66 → 2563.30] To God
[2563.30 → 2564.44] He is incredibly
[2564.44 → 2566.18] Generous
[2566.18 → 2568.08] But despite
[2568.08 → 2569.36] All of those things
[2569.36 → 2570.40] Despite the fact
[2570.40 → 2571.48] That he seems to be
[2571.48 → 2572.22] A pretty
[2572.22 → 2573.64] Outstanding guy
[2573.64 → 2574.78] In all of these ways
[2574.78 → 2576.74] But due to his
[2576.74 → 2577.40] Ethnicity
[2577.40 → 2578.36] Being a Gentile
[2578.36 → 2579.52] He was excluded
[2579.52 → 2581.60] From full inclusion
[2581.60 → 2582.90] In the people of God
[2582.90 → 2584.24] He is standing
[2584.24 → 2585.22] Outside the bounds
[2585.22 → 2585.66] Of grace
[2585.66 → 2586.68] Looking in
[2586.68 → 2587.52] Aware
[2587.52 → 2588.52] Of God
[2588.52 → 2589.86] And his moral demands
[2589.86 → 2590.84] But not part
[2590.84 → 2592.56] Of the people of God
[2592.56 → 2593.20] And as I was thinking
[2593.20 → 2593.68] About this
[2593.68 → 2594.32] And Cornelius
[2594.32 → 2595.16] The image that popped
[2595.16 → 2595.68] In my head
[2595.68 → 2597.56] Was as a kid
[2597.56 → 2598.96] Our dog
[2598.96 → 2599.76] Our family dog
[2599.76 → 2600.72] Standing outside
[2600.72 → 2602.76] The sliding glass door
[2602.76 → 2604.58] Looking in
[2604.58 → 2605.36] And looking sad
[2605.36 → 2606.24] And wanting to come in
[2606.24 → 2606.98] So that's just the image
[2606.98 → 2607.68] That popped in my head
[2607.68 → 2608.64] It's kind of
[2608.64 → 2610.14] But there's Cornelius
[2610.14 → 2610.44] You know
[2610.44 → 2611.54] Standing outside
[2611.54 → 2612.68] The people of God
[2612.68 → 2614.14] Looking in
[2614.14 → 2617.06] Wanting to
[2617.06 → 2617.62] Be
[2617.62 → 2618.36] Being attracted
[2618.36 → 2619.08] To God
[2619.08 → 2619.78] And his people
[2619.78 → 2620.76] And wanting to be
[2620.76 → 2621.42] Part of that
[2621.42 → 2624.26] We see here
[2624.26 → 2625.44] That being
[2625.44 → 2626.36] Being devout
[2626.36 → 2627.46] Being generous
[2627.46 → 2629.50] Is not
[2629.50 → 2630.38] What brings you
[2630.38 → 2631.10] Into relationship
[2631.10 → 2631.68] With God
[2631.68 → 2633.42] Cornelius
[2633.42 → 2634.38] Needs to hear
[2634.38 → 2635.36] The message
[2635.36 → 2636.02] Of the gospel
[2636.02 → 2637.58] He needs to put
[2637.58 → 2638.66] His faith in Christ
[2638.66 → 2639.88] And that's why
[2639.88 → 2641.42] God sends an angel
[2641.42 → 2642.48] To Cornelius
[2642.48 → 2643.44] To tell him
[2643.44 → 2644.38] To call for Peter
[2644.38 → 2646.32] And so he does that
[2646.32 → 2647.00] Cornelius
[2647.00 → 2648.16] Obeys the vision
[2648.16 → 2649.52] He sends three men
[2649.52 → 2650.46] To travel down
[2650.46 → 2651.58] To Joppa
[2651.58 → 2652.44] To ask Peter
[2652.44 → 2653.76] To come back with them
[2653.76 → 2655.36] God is going to
[2655.36 → 2656.26] Reveal the gospel
[2656.26 → 2657.28] To Cornelius
[2657.28 → 2658.34] Through his vessel
[2658.34 → 2659.10] Peter
[2659.10 → 2660.84] So that's the first
[2660.84 → 2661.86] Neighbour we see here
[2661.86 → 2663.06] Cornelius
[2663.06 → 2663.82] This devout
[2663.82 → 2664.70] Centurion
[2664.70 → 2666.66] The second neighbour
[2666.66 → 2668.02] Is Peter
[2668.02 → 2669.72] Of course
[2669.72 → 2670.36] We already know
[2670.36 → 2671.12] Who Peter is
[2671.12 → 2672.14] Peter is one of
[2672.14 → 2673.10] Jesus' closest
[2673.10 → 2673.70] Disciples
[2673.70 → 2674.88] And he was
[2674.88 → 2676.04] A devout Jew
[2676.04 → 2677.38] From Israel
[2677.38 → 2678.90] And we see
[2678.90 → 2680.34] Just how devout
[2680.34 → 2681.86] Peter is
[2681.86 → 2682.52] And what happens
[2682.52 → 2683.00] Next
[2683.00 → 2685.26] After the angel
[2685.26 → 2686.62] Visits Cornelius
[2686.62 → 2688.48] The scene shifts
[2688.48 → 2689.66] And we see Peter
[2689.66 → 2691.16] Where's Peter?
[2691.26 → 2692.06] He's on a rooftop
[2692.06 → 2693.50] He is in prayer
[2693.50 → 2695.40] And while he's in prayer
[2695.40 → 2696.32] He sees a vision
[2696.32 → 2697.98] A sheet
[2697.98 → 2699.06] Filled with
[2699.06 → 2700.34] Every kind
[2700.34 → 2701.62] Of living creature
[2701.62 → 2702.66] Comes down
[2702.66 → 2703.24] And it says
[2703.24 → 2704.08] Peter is hungry
[2704.08 → 2705.58] So this sheet
[2705.58 → 2706.20] Lowers down
[2706.20 → 2706.82] In front of him
[2706.82 → 2708.56] And a divine voice
[2708.56 → 2709.00] Says
[2709.00 → 2709.72] Get up Peter
[2709.72 → 2710.50] Kill
[2710.50 → 2711.58] And eat
[2711.58 → 2712.54] You know
[2712.54 → 2713.22] We have a restaurant
[2713.22 → 2713.86] In Richmond
[2713.86 → 2714.62] Called
[2714.62 → 2715.52] John 3
[2715.52 → 2716.42] 16
[2716.42 → 2717.62] But I don't know
[2717.62 → 2718.04] Why they don't
[2718.04 → 2718.54] Have a restaurant
[2718.54 → 2719.26] Called Acts
[2719.26 → 2719.76] 10
[2719.76 → 2721.18] 15
[2721.18 → 2721.56] I'm not sure
[2721.56 → 2721.84] What verse
[2721.84 → 2722.04] It is
[2722.04 → 2722.56] 13
[2722.56 → 2723.84] Right
[2723.84 → 2724.16] Wouldn't that be
[2724.16 → 2724.42] Great
[2724.42 → 2724.78] You know
[2724.78 → 2725.12] They can put it
[2725.12 → 2725.60] On the menu
[2725.60 → 2726.40] Rise
[2726.40 → 2727.16] Kill and eat
[2727.16 → 2728.84] I don't know
[2728.84 → 2729.48] But
[2729.48 → 2730.40] Anyway
[2730.40 → 2730.94] But Peter
[2730.94 → 2732.16] He is an
[2732.16 → 2733.04] Observant Jew
[2733.04 → 2734.62] He understands
[2734.62 → 2735.20] That there are
[2735.20 → 2736.28] Certain foods
[2736.28 → 2736.92] That Jews
[2736.92 → 2737.48] Can
[2737.48 → 2738.52] And cannot
[2738.52 → 2739.26] Eat
[2739.26 → 2740.42] And we find
[2740.42 → 2741.32] This clearly
[2741.32 → 2742.28] In places
[2742.28 → 2743.10] Like Leviticus
[2743.10 → 2743.50] 11
[2743.50 → 2744.72] So Peter
[2744.72 → 2745.34] Has grown up
[2745.34 → 2746.10] His whole life
[2746.10 → 2747.48] Being told
[2747.48 → 2748.04] You're not
[2748.04 → 2748.50] Allowed
[2748.50 → 2749.16] To eat
[2749.16 → 2750.14] Unclean
[2750.14 → 2750.52] Food
[2750.52 → 2752.18] And that's
[2752.18 → 2753.16] Why he responds
[2753.16 → 2754.20] The way he does
[2754.20 → 2755.10] In verse 14
[2755.10 → 2755.80] He says
[2755.80 → 2756.90] Surely
[2756.90 → 2757.88] Not
[2757.88 → 2758.40] Lord
[2758.40 → 2759.46] This is
[2759.46 → 2760.08] Emphatic
[2760.08 → 2760.74] Surely
[2760.74 → 2761.22] Not
[2761.22 → 2761.90] I have
[2761.90 → 2762.42] Never
[2762.42 → 2762.94] Eaten
[2762.94 → 2763.78] Anything
[2763.78 → 2764.78] Impure
[2764.78 → 2765.60] Or
[2765.60 → 2766.40] Unclean
[2766.40 → 2768.20] And Peter's
[2768.20 → 2768.88] Response here
[2768.88 → 2769.58] To this vision
[2769.58 → 2770.06] Helps us
[2770.06 → 2770.52] Understand
[2770.52 → 2770.94] Something
[2770.94 → 2771.46] About the
[2771.46 → 2772.02] Fence
[2772.02 → 2772.82] That had
[2772.82 → 2773.30] Been built
[2773.30 → 2773.60] Up
[2773.60 → 2774.10] Between
[2774.10 → 2774.80] Jews
[2774.80 → 2775.52] And Gentiles
[2775.52 → 2775.86] Okay
[2775.86 → 2776.34] So here's
[2776.34 → 2776.78] The history
[2776.78 → 2777.18] Of this
[2777.18 → 2777.64] Briefly
[2777.64 → 2779.70] God's plan
[2779.70 → 2781.66] From the
[2781.66 → 2782.04] Beginning
[2782.04 → 2782.72] Was to
[2782.72 → 2783.48] Save people
[2783.48 → 2784.50] From every
[2784.50 → 2785.12] Tongue tribe
[2785.12 → 2785.62] And nation
[2785.62 → 2787.20] Save
[2787.20 → 2787.76] Save a
[2787.76 → 2788.10] People
[2788.10 → 2788.78] To be
[2788.78 → 2789.34] His people
[2789.34 → 2789.84] To belong
[2789.84 → 2790.34] To himself
[2790.34 → 2790.72] From all
[2790.72 → 2791.16] The nations
[2791.16 → 2792.44] So God
[2792.44 → 2793.92] The way he
[2793.92 → 2795.12] Accomplished his
[2795.12 → 2795.70] Plan is he
[2795.70 → 2796.52] Chose one man
[2796.52 → 2797.12] Abram
[2797.12 → 2798.02] And through
[2798.02 → 2798.74] Abraham he
[2798.74 → 2799.04] Promised
[2799.04 → 2799.36] That he was
[2799.36 → 2799.60] Going to make
[2799.60 → 2800.26] A great nation
[2800.26 → 2801.38] So that all
[2801.38 → 2801.88] The families
[2801.88 → 2802.60] Of the earth
[2802.60 → 2803.44] Would be blessed
[2803.44 → 2804.00] Through
[2804.00 → 2805.06] Them
[2805.06 → 2806.64] And God
[2806.64 → 2807.56] Had a special
[2807.56 → 2808.38] Relationship
[2808.38 → 2808.86] With his
[2808.86 → 2809.22] People
[2809.22 → 2810.40] And he gave
[2810.40 → 2811.14] Them these
[2811.14 → 2812.18] Dietary laws
[2812.18 → 2812.72] He gave them
[2812.72 → 2813.92] Ceremonial laws
[2813.92 → 2815.46] To show that
[2815.46 → 2816.48] They were to
[2816.48 → 2817.22] Be a distinct
[2817.22 → 2817.68] People
[2817.68 → 2818.36] They were to
[2818.36 → 2819.02] Be God's
[2819.02 → 2819.34] People
[2819.34 → 2820.04] To live
[2820.04 → 2820.54] According to
[2820.54 → 2820.92] God's
[2820.92 → 2821.34] Ways
[2821.34 → 2822.54] And that they
[2822.54 → 2822.84] Were to be
[2822.84 → 2823.40] Different from
[2823.40 → 2823.86] The nations
[2823.86 → 2824.44] Around them
[2824.44 → 2825.62] And these
[2825.62 → 2826.92] Dietary laws
[2826.92 → 2827.92] Were to do
[2827.92 → 2828.22] A couple
[2828.22 → 2828.58] Things
[2828.58 → 2829.04] They were to
[2829.04 → 2829.72] Reflect
[2829.72 → 2830.44] God's
[2830.44 → 2830.98] Holiness
[2830.98 → 2832.26] And they
[2832.26 → 2832.68] Were supposed
[2832.68 → 2833.36] To point
[2833.36 → 2833.70] To the
[2833.70 → 2834.20] Deeper
[2834.20 → 2834.62] Need
[2834.62 → 2834.96] That we
[2834.96 → 2835.76] All have
[2835.76 → 2837.08] For spiritual
[2837.08 → 2837.82] Cleanliness
[2837.82 → 2839.16] Right
[2839.16 → 2839.60] Not to
[2839.60 → 2840.42] Give ourselves
[2840.42 → 2841.18] Over to the
[2841.18 → 2841.74] Worship of
[2841.74 → 2842.48] False gods
[2842.48 → 2842.98] Not to
[2842.98 → 2843.44] Defile
[2843.44 → 2843.90] Ourselves
[2843.90 → 2844.28] With the
[2844.28 → 2844.80] Practices
[2844.80 → 2845.16] Of the
[2845.16 → 2845.74] Other nations
[2845.74 → 2846.50] That will
[2846.50 → 2847.06] Kill us
[2847.06 → 2847.74] Spiritually
[2847.74 → 2848.96] And draw us
[2848.96 → 2849.48] Away from
[2849.48 → 2850.14] Knowing God
[2850.14 → 2851.82] And now
[2851.82 → 2852.76] These attitudes
[2852.76 → 2853.28] Though
[2853.28 → 2854.80] Toward
[2854.80 → 2855.52] Clean and
[2855.52 → 2856.04] Unclean
[2856.04 → 2856.52] Food
[2856.52 → 2857.40] Were deeply
[2857.40 → 2858.40] Ingrained
[2858.40 → 2859.20] In Peter
[2859.20 → 2859.56] As we
[2859.56 → 2859.96] Have seen
[2859.96 → 2861.22] When he
[2861.22 → 2861.86] Was told
[2861.86 → 2862.62] To eat
[2862.62 → 2863.74] This unclean
[2863.74 → 2864.22] Food
[2864.22 → 2865.48] Right
[2865.48 → 2865.80] When this
[2865.80 → 2866.60] Vision appeared
[2866.60 → 2867.00] To him
[2867.00 → 2868.06] He violently
[2868.06 → 2868.76] Objects
[2868.76 → 2869.38] By no
[2869.38 → 2870.10] Means
[2870.10 → 2870.52] Lord
[2870.52 → 2871.82] You know
[2871.82 → 2872.46] Maybe he
[2872.46 → 2872.86] Thought the
[2872.86 → 2873.16] Lord was
[2873.16 → 2873.84] Testing him
[2873.84 → 2874.46] That he
[2874.46 → 2875.04] Needed to
[2875.04 → 2876.08] Hold on
[2876.08 → 2876.36] To the
[2876.36 → 2876.72] Law
[2876.72 → 2877.40] No
[2877.40 → 2878.08] I won't
[2878.08 → 2878.52] I won't
[2878.52 → 2879.06] Do this
[2879.06 → 2880.58] You know
[2880.58 → 2880.86] I don't
[2880.86 → 2881.20] Know how
[2881.20 → 2881.58] Many of
[2881.58 → 2881.80] You have
[2881.80 → 2882.32] Sounded
[2882.32 → 2883.14] At God
[2883.14 → 2883.62] Like that
[2883.62 → 2884.14] No
[2884.14 → 2884.60] Lord
[2884.60 → 2885.60] Three
[2885.60 → 2886.34] Times
[2886.34 → 2888.20] It's kind
[2888.20 → 2888.72] Of Peter's
[2888.72 → 2889.30] Magic number
[2889.30 → 2889.66] Right
[2889.66 → 2889.94] Three
[2889.94 → 2890.24] Times
[2890.24 → 2890.44] Three
[2890.44 → 2890.68] Times
[2890.68 → 2891.10] He denied
[2891.10 → 2891.32] The
[2891.32 → 2891.52] Lord
[2891.52 → 2891.80] Three
[2891.80 → 2892.06] Times
[2892.06 → 2892.24] God
[2892.24 → 2892.42] Had to
[2892.42 → 2892.70] Restore
[2892.70 → 2892.90] Him
[2892.90 → 2893.40] Three
[2893.40 → 2893.70] Times
[2893.70 → 2893.84] He
[2893.84 → 2894.18] Says
[2894.18 → 2895.10] Kill and
[2895.10 → 2895.30] Eat
[2895.30 → 2895.78] Three
[2895.78 → 2896.04] Times
[2896.04 → 2896.26] Peter
[2896.26 → 2896.46] Says
[2896.46 → 2896.72] No
[2896.72 → 2897.78] I mean
[2897.78 → 2898.00] This
[2898.00 → 2898.14] Is
[2898.14 → 2898.84] Deeply
[2898.84 → 2899.78] Ingrained
[2899.78 → 2901.24] But
[2901.24 → 2901.56] What's
[2901.56 → 2902.08] Tragic
[2902.08 → 2902.44] Here
[2902.44 → 2902.88] Is
[2902.88 → 2903.02] That
[2903.02 → 2903.14] For
[2903.14 → 2903.48] Peter
[2903.48 → 2903.64] And
[2903.64 → 2903.74] For
[2903.74 → 2903.92] Many
[2903.92 → 2904.04] Of
[2904.04 → 2904.16] The
[2904.16 → 2904.38] Jews
[2904.38 → 2904.54] This
[2904.54 → 2905.04] Attitude
[2905.04 → 2905.28] About
[2905.28 → 2905.90] Ritual
[2905.90 → 2907.32] Uncleanness
[2909.06 → 2909.60] Teach Them
[2909.60 → 2910.94] Their
[2910.94 → 2911.24] Need
[2911.24 → 2911.38] To
[2911.38 → 2911.58] Be
[2911.58 → 2912.06] Cleansed
[2912.06 → 2912.18] By
[2912.18 → 2912.48] God's
[2912.48 → 2912.92] Grace
[2912.92 → 2913.82] Had
[2913.82 → 2914.24] Crept
[2914.24 → 2914.48] Into
[2914.48 → 2914.72] Their
[2914.72 → 2915.08] Views
[2915.08 → 2915.22] Of
[2915.22 → 2915.54] People
[2915.54 → 2916.48] So
[2916.48 → 2916.64] That
[2916.64 → 2916.86] Now
[2916.86 → 2917.06] They
[2917.06 → 2917.36] Deemed
[2917.36 → 2917.98] People
[2917.98 → 2918.44] To
[2918.44 → 2918.58] Be
[2918.58 → 2919.12] Unclean
[2919.12 → 2920.14] Particularly
[2920.14 → 2921.12] Non-Jews
[2921.12 → 2922.04] And
[2922.04 → 2922.24] Over
[2922.24 → 2922.70] Time
[2922.70 → 2922.88] They
[2922.88 → 2923.06] Be
[2923.06 → 2923.52] They
[2923.52 → 2923.86] Began
[2923.86 → 2924.08] To
[2924.08 → 2925.20] Embellish
[2925.20 → 2925.78] On
[2925.78 → 2925.90] The
[2925.90 → 2926.20] Law
[2926.20 → 2926.86] And
[2926.86 → 2926.96] They
[2926.96 → 2927.14] Try
[2927.14 → 2927.24] To
[2927.24 → 2927.38] Go
[2927.38 → 2927.74] Beyond
[2927.74 → 2927.94] The
[2927.94 → 2928.10] Law
[2928.10 → 2928.26] With
[2928.26 → 2928.48] All
[2928.48 → 2928.62] These
[2928.62 → 2928.80] Other
[2928.80 → 2929.44] Practices
[2929.44 → 2929.68] Like
[2929.68 → 2929.82] Of
[2929.82 → 2930.08] Hand
[2930.08 → 2930.54] Washing
[2930.54 → 2930.98] And
[2930.98 → 2931.22] Other
[2931.22 → 2931.68] Things
[2931.68 → 2932.32] To
[2932.32 → 2932.56] Make
[2932.56 → 2932.96] Sure
[2932.96 → 2933.46] That
[2933.46 → 2933.68] They
[2933.68 → 2934.16] Never
[2934.16 → 2934.48] Were
[2934.48 → 2935.24] Defiled
[2935.24 → 2935.82] In
[2939.06 → 2939.22] These
[2939.22 → 2939.64] Extra
[2939.64 → 2940.00] Biblical
[2940.00 → 2940.70] Traditions
[2940.70 → 2941.30] That
[2941.30 → 2941.44] They
[2941.44 → 2941.92] Had
[2941.92 → 2943.38] Practically

[3103.12 → 3104.24] Are
[3104.24 → 3104.46] Just

[3104.62 → 3104.82] God
[3104.82 → 3104.98] Has
[3104.98 → 3105.24] Given

[3114.12 → 3114.32] This
[3114.32 → 3114.56] Means
[3114.56 → 3114.74] That
[3114.74 → 3114.90] The
[3114.90 → 3115.22] Sense
[3115.22 → 3115.38] Of

[3121.20 → 3121.34] A
[3121.34 → 3121.62] Sign
[3121.62 → 3121.76] Of
[3121.76 → 3121.92] The

[3122.56 → 3122.72] In
[3122.72 → 3122.88] Our

[3123.30 → 3124.50] That

[3125.02 → 3125.28] Us

[3128.12 → 3128.20] We
[3132.36 → 3132.84] Forgotten
[3132.84 → 3132.96] The
[3132.96 → 3133.30] Gospel
[3133.30 → 3134.96] And
[3134.96 → 3135.20] That's
[3135.20 → 3135.32] What
[3135.32 → 3135.62] Builds
[3135.62 → 3136.02] Fences
[3136.02 → 3136.94] Between

[3137.38 → 3137.52] Other
[3137.52 → 3137.84] People
[3137.84 → 3138.76] That's
[3138.76 → 3138.88] What

[3139.02 → 3139.38] Did
[3139.38 → 3139.58] In
[3139.58 → 3140.20] Peter's
[3140.20 → 3140.42] Day
[3140.42 → 3140.60] And
[3140.60 → 3140.78] That's
[3140.78 → 3140.92] What
[3140.92 → 3141.02] It
[3141.02 → 3141.22] Does
[3141.22 → 3141.34] In

[3141.46 → 3141.72] Day
[3141.72 → 3144.62] Okay

[3151.78 → 3151.96] Is
[3151.96 → 3152.26] This
[3152.26 → 3152.86] Something
[3152.86 → 3153.14] There
[3153.14 → 3153.38] Is
[3153.38 → 3153.52] That
[3153.52 → 3153.76] Doesn't
[3153.76 → 3153.92] Love

[3196.68 → 3196.90] Doing
[3196.90 → 3197.20] More

[4337.78 → 4341.18] We'll continue the worship this morning
[4341.18 → 4343.38] by the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4344.38 → 4346.54] And our designated offering for today
[4346.54 → 4348.74] is North American Indigenous Ministries,
[4349.46 → 4352.54] where we support Howard and Annie Johnson
[4352.54 → 4354.04] and Tim and Charity Johnson
[4354.04 → 4357.76] as they minister to some First Nations communities
[4357.76 → 4359.36] up near Shushan, I believe.
[4359.98 → 4362.18] And actually, you can find an insert in your bulletin
[4362.18 → 4366.90] which talks about our denominations' ministry
[4366.90 → 4370.92] and to share the gospel amongst Indigenous peoples.
[4372.62 → 4375.16] So just another reminder again
[4375.16 → 4376.46] that as all the deacons,
[4376.66 → 4378.28] please come forward to collect the offering.
[4378.60 → 4380.06] And we have these new offering bags
[4380.06 → 4382.80], and please do take them as they are passed to you.
[4383.02 → 4385.08] Even if you've already given it online or whatever,
[4385.18 → 4385.78] just take it.
[4386.76 → 4388.46] You don't have to put your hand in,
[4388.50 → 4392.04] but you could just to, you know, whatever.
[4392.78 → 4394.24] But go ahead and take it, pass it on,
[4394.48 → 4395.72] and we'll collect the offering.
[4395.72 → 4395.78] Thank you.
[4422.18 → 4425.72] Thank you.
[4425.72 → 4429.26] Thank you.

[4648.46 → 4652.52] So let's continue to come before the Lord together in prayer.
[4653.06 → 4654.08] Would you please pray with me?
[4656.18 → 4660.76] Lord, we acknowledge today that some of us come before you with hearts full of joy,
[4661.72 → 4664.44] and some must come before you with heavy hearts.
[4665.72 → 4673.30] And wherever we are, Lord, we are grateful that you accept us as we are,
[4673.30 → 4680.38] as we come before you because we are clothed in the righteousness of Jesus our Lord,
[4681.18 → 4686.46] who is at the right hand of God and who ever lives to make intercession for us.
[4687.18 → 4689.02] We come before you in his name.
[4689.82 → 4692.56] Lord, may you be praised in and through all things.
[4693.62 → 4695.88] There is much that we have to be thankful for.
[4696.12 → 4699.36] Father, we thank you for Father's Day today.
[4699.56 → 4702.48] We thank you for the fathers that you have put in our lives.
[4704.18 → 4709.72] And to be men to the younger people that you have put in our lives.
[4710.66 → 4714.92] Father, again, most importantly, we thank you that you are our Heavenly Father.
[4715.80 → 4717.54] And Lord, you are good and you love us.
[4717.62 → 4719.38] You provide for us and care for us.
[4719.78 → 4720.88] You discipline us.
[4722.04 → 4724.28] You strengthen us, and you raise us up.
[4724.80 → 4727.08] Lord, that we might become more and more like you.
[4727.80 → 4729.08] Lord, we thank you for that.
[4729.08 → 4736.56] And Lord, help us today, no matter who we are and what our family situation looks like,
[4737.44 → 4746.70] Father, just to rest and take joy in this closest of all relationships that we have with you,
[4747.82 → 4750.10] that you call us sons and daughters.
[4750.10 → 4757.14] Lord, there are also things that we want to bring before you because they are heavy on our hearts.
[4757.74 → 4767.50] Lord, we specifically pray for Pat Bowman again, who is going in for another surgery, second or third, I'm not sure, for her elbow.
[4768.46 → 4773.64] And Lord, we pray that you would help the doctor to be able to mend all the broken bones that are there.
[4773.64 → 4778.78] And Lord, would the surgery be successful, and would you give her a speedy recovery?
[4779.76 → 4782.02] We continue to pray for Amy Iron.
[4782.78 → 4794.12] Lord, would you continue to use the doctors, the medicines, but most importantly, Lord, would you be her good physician?
[4794.58 → 4800.56] Lord, would you heal her from her illness and make her well again, Lord?
[4800.56 → 4805.84] We pray for John Van Toll as he's at Mountain View Manor.
[4805.96 → 4818.36] And Lord, even as it seems he is struggling in different ways, Lord, would you continue to put your arm around him?
[4818.50 → 4819.56] Would you be close to him?
[4819.88 → 4827.06] And Lord, would you cause him to know and remember and to trust and believe that he belongs to you and that you are with him?
[4827.06 → 4834.08] Father, we know there are many others who are hurting and laid low.
[4834.70 → 4846.98] God, we pray for those who have physical ailments, those struggling with addiction and mental health challenges, as well as those who have broken and strained relationships.
[4847.26 → 4854.42] Lord, we can confess that these situations can be all-consuming, and they can cause us to lose heart.
[4854.42 → 4863.10] But today, Father, we cry out to you that we might, whatever our circumstances, Lord, have a glimpse of your glory.
[4863.10 → 4870.90] And to remember who you are, the great physician, our comforter, our ever-present help, and our Saviour.
[4872.56 → 4875.24] And Lord, we recognize that you are at work in this world.
[4875.24 → 4882.76] And as we are thankful that you, we're also thankful that you're bringing those who are lost to yourself.
[4883.38 → 4886.26] And you do it through us, Lord, your people, as your vessels.
[4887.24 → 4895.62] And so we also ask that you would empower each one of us to be able to share the comfort that we have and the hope that we have in Christ with those around us.
[4895.62 → 4901.78] And as we do, Lord, we ask that you would nourish our souls, strengthen us to be our witnesses.
[4902.96 → 4907.64] And lastly, Lord, our denomination has just concluded its annual synod.
[4907.64 → 4915.66] And there is much division.
[4917.50 → 4924.56] And so, Lord, we pray for your mercy upon your church, the Christian Reformed Church.
[4924.94 → 4931.12] And, Lord, for all the individual churches, ministers, delegates who return to their churches.
[4931.12 → 4936.60] Lord, would you help us, Lord, to continue to walk in your ways.
[4937.74 → 4941.86] And, Lord, would you heal us, heal our churches.
[4942.56 → 4949.24] And, Lord, would you call us to unity, unity in the gospel that we share together.
[4949.90 → 4951.98] Lord, would you continue to be at work.
[4952.08 → 4953.06] We need you to be at work.
[4953.80 → 4959.34] And, Lord, all of these things we pray in the strong and mighty name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[4959.34 → 4960.14] Amen.
[4962.12 → 4963.00] Let's stand.
[4966.74 → 4971.74] And as we go, we go out with God's blessing, his good word upon us.
[4971.80 → 4974.80] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving his blessing.
[4975.94 → 4984.18] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us.
[4984.28 → 4990.10] To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.
[4990.70 → 4991.00] Amen.
[4991.54 → 4992.54] Please remain standing.
[4992.68 → 4993.80] We'll sing our final song.
[4993.80 → 5000.14] And right afterwards, I invite you to join us for a time of coffee and fellowship through the doors and in the fellowship hall.
[5000.14 → 5001.14] Thank you.
[5001.14 → 5002.14] Thank you.
[5002.14 → 5003.14] Thank you.

[5084.14 → 5096.14] For endless days we will sing your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
