[864.30 --> 866.76]  And Luther said, there's two books you need for life.
[866.76 --> 868.56]  The Bible and your hymn book.
[868.72 --> 871.24]  And he wrote several hymns.
[871.50 --> 876.64]  And the most enduring, most famous of those is A Mighty Fortress is Our God.
[876.64 --> 889.50]  So we include that on a day like today to honor that change in history and the theology that he brought to the hymns.
[889.78 --> 897.08]  And just the statement of what this does and encouraging us that God is on our side and we need not fear.
[897.88 --> 898.92]  Mel, go ahead.
[906.64 --> 936.62]  Mel, go ahead.
[936.62 --> 938.88]  is our God
[938.88 --> 940.62]  above all

[956.56 --> 959.14]  for
[959.14 --> 960.64]  still our
[960.64 --> 963.02]  ancient flow

[992.46 --> 994.46]  of fire our
[994.46 --> 995.42]  striving
[995.42 --> 997.32]  would be
[997.32 --> 998.90]  losing
[998.90 --> 1002.10]  we're not
[1002.10 --> 1003.54]  the right
[1003.54 --> 1004.92]  man on
[1004.92 --> 1006.04]  our side
[1006.04 --> 1008.24]  the man of
[1008.24 --> 1009.62]  God's own
[1009.62 --> 1009.90]  choosing
[1009.90 --> 1013.90]  you ask
[1014.62 --> 1015.84]  who that
[1015.84 --> 1017.90]  may be
[1017.90 --> 1019.90]  Christ Jesus
[1019.90 --> 1020.54]  Christ
[1020.54 --> 1022.26]  is he

[1032.10 --> 1033.48]  the same
[1033.48 --> 1036.28]  and he
[1036.28 --> 1037.62]  must win
[1037.62 --> 1038.34]  the
[1038.34 --> 1039.26]  battle
[1039.26 --> 1040.26]  the

[1052.70 --> 1054.80]  us
[1054.80 --> 1055.96]  we
[1055.96 --> 1056.74]  will

[1057.44 --> 1058.08]  fear
[1058.08 --> 1058.78]  for
[1058.78 --> 1059.58]  God
[1059.58 --> 1060.24]  has
[1060.24 --> 1060.72]  will
[1060.72 --> 1061.64]  his
[1061.64 --> 1062.28]  truth
[1062.28 --> 1062.84]  to
[1062.84 --> 1063.84]  triumph
[1063.84 --> 1065.00]  through
[1065.00 --> 1067.36]  us
[1067.36 --> 1068.46]  the
[1068.46 --> 1069.32]  prince
[1069.32 --> 1069.92]  of
[1069.92 --> 1071.28]  darkness

[1072.08 --> 1073.84]  we
[1073.84 --> 1075.24]  tremble
[1075.24 --> 1076.02]  not
[1076.02 --> 1076.74]  for
[1076.74 --> 1078.08]  him
[1078.08 --> 1079.40]  his
[1079.40 --> 1080.08]  rage
[1080.08 --> 1080.48]  we

[1082.84 --> 1084.92]  for
[1084.92 --> 1085.64]  all
[1085.64 --> 1086.38]  his
[1086.38 --> 1087.06]  doom
[1087.06 --> 1087.74]  is
[1087.74 --> 1088.84]  sure
[1088.84 --> 1090.52]  from
[1090.52 --> 1091.24]  his
[1091.24 --> 1091.96]  hope
[1091.96 --> 1093.28]  shall
[1093.28 --> 1095.04]  fail
[1095.04 --> 1096.72]  him
[1096.72 --> 1099.14]  that
[1099.14 --> 1099.94]  word
[1099.94 --> 1100.94]  above
[1100.94 --> 1102.26]  all
[1102.26 --> 1103.38]  earthly
[1103.38 --> 1104.38]  powers

[1105.30 --> 1106.06]  thanks
[1106.06 --> 1106.82]  to

[1108.50 --> 1110.78]  again
[1110.78 --> 1113.12]  the
[1113.12 --> 1114.04]  spirit
[1114.04 --> 1115.50]  and
[1115.50 --> 1116.18]  the
[1116.18 --> 1116.94]  gifts
[1116.94 --> 1117.70]  of
[1117.70 --> 1118.28]  us
[1118.28 --> 1119.18]  through
[1119.18 --> 1120.02]  him
[1120.02 --> 1120.82]  who
[1120.82 --> 1121.56]  with
[1121.56 --> 1122.14]  us
[1122.14 --> 1124.24]  silence
[1124.24 --> 1127.04]  let
[1127.04 --> 1127.86]  goods
[1127.86 --> 1128.54]  and
[1128.54 --> 1129.56]  kindred
[1129.56 --> 1131.24]  go
[1131.24 --> 1132.66]  this
[1132.66 --> 1133.56]  mortal
[1133.56 --> 1134.86]  life
[1134.86 --> 1135.90]  also
[1135.90 --> 1138.06]  the
[1138.06 --> 1139.26]  body
[1139.26 --> 1140.18]  they
[1140.18 --> 1141.24]  may
[1141.24 --> 1142.58]  bear
[1142.58 --> 1144.08]  God's
[1144.08 --> 1144.78]  truth
[1144.78 --> 1146.30]  abide
[1146.30 --> 1146.96]  him
[1146.96 --> 1147.70]  still
[1147.70 --> 1150.02]  his
[1150.02 --> 1150.86]  kingdom
[1150.86 --> 1152.30]  is
[1152.30 --> 1153.18]  forever
[1153.18 --> 1154.30]  come
[1154.30 --> 1155.92]  home
[1155.92 --> 1160.78]  amen
[1160.78 --> 1161.66]  you may be seated
[1161.66 --> 1171.64]  congregation at the front of this building there's a sign that tells us that we belong
[1171.64 --> 1173.14]  to reformed church
[1173.14 --> 1175.06]  but I think that's not quite right
[1175.06 --> 1181.06]  I'd like to suggest perhaps the word reforming church is maybe a better descriptor
[1181.06 --> 1184.82]  in Luther's day there was a prevailing thought among the early Protestants
[1184.82 --> 1189.24]  that the printing press would usher in a priesthood of all believers
[1189.24 --> 1192.08]  and with it an era of peace and harmony
[1192.08 --> 1198.16]  the hard work was nearly done and all that was left was a matter of spreading the truth and watching it grow
[1198.16 --> 1202.16]  but we live in a sinful world
[1202.16 --> 1203.16]  instead of peace
[1203.16 --> 1207.16]  the 95 thesis kicked off the wars of the reformation
[1207.16 --> 1209.16]  200 years of bloodshed
[1209.16 --> 1215.16]  when up to 20 million people died violent deaths at the hands of so-called fellow Christians
[1215.16 --> 1222.16]  indeed many areas in modern-day Holland and Germany lost half their population in just 30 years
[1222.16 --> 1234.16]  it's a sobering thought and a reminder how quickly the devil will take God's name our strong convictions and our attitudes our faith and technology and use them instead for evil
[1234.16 --> 1241.16]  for us as Christians it's a reminder to look at the brutality in the Middle East this month
[1241.16 --> 1243.16]  not with reproach and disdain
[1243.16 --> 1248.16]  but with compassion and humility
[1248.16 --> 1253.16]  thankfully God's work in our lives is not finished
[1253.16 --> 1257.16]  his work through us is not finished
[1257.16 --> 1260.16]  his work through us is not finished
[1260.16 --> 1264.16]  and his work in this world is not finished
[1264.16 --> 1271.16]  indeed God invites us now as he does every day to bring our temptations our failings our sins
[1271.16 --> 1274.16]  the sins of this world before him
[1274.16 --> 1278.16]  may we rejoice always in his pardon and give him thanks
[1278.16 --> 1280.16]  yes
[1280.16 --> 1283.16]  our reformation is still ongoing
[1283.16 --> 1285.16]  but our redemption is complete
[1285.16 --> 1289.16]  let us come to God in prayer
[1289.16 --> 1291.16]  holy God
[1291.16 --> 1295.16]  we come before you this morning to confess our sins
[1295.16 --> 1298.16]  we often stray from your kingdom work
[1298.16 --> 1300.16]  and we're often drawn to idols
[1300.16 --> 1304.16]  and to plans that reflect our will rather than yours
[1304.16 --> 1307.16]  for the wickedness we have done
[1307.16 --> 1313.16]  and for the goodness we have left undone
[1313.16 --> 1315.16]  forgive us
[1316.16 --> 1319.16]  and yet we come to you this morning with joy
[1319.16 --> 1322.16]  because you oh Lord are merciful
[1322.16 --> 1327.16]  we bring our broken contrite hearts to you as an offering
[1327.16 --> 1329.16]  we thank you for the cross
[1329.16 --> 1334.16]  we thank you for your son Jesus who suffered the justice that our many sins deserved
[1334.16 --> 1338.16]  heavenly father guide us towards righteousness and goodness
[1338.16 --> 1342.16]  the righteousness and goodness poured out through our redeemer
[1342.16 --> 1344.16]  help us to discern what is good
[1344.16 --> 1347.16]  shun evil and may everything we do
[1347.16 --> 1350.16]  further your will and be for your glory
[1350.16 --> 1351.16]  amen
[1351.16 --> 1357.16]  in the days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established at the highest of the mountains
[1357.16 --> 1360.16]  and shall be raised up above the hills
[1360.16 --> 1362.16]  all nations shall stream to it
[1362.16 --> 1363.16]  many people shall come and say
[1363.16 --> 1366.16]  come let us go up the mountain of the Lord
[1366.16 --> 1369.16]  to the house of the God of Jacob
[1369.16 --> 1373.16]  that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths
[1373.16 --> 1375.16]  for out of Zion shall go forth instruction
[1375.16 --> 1379.16]  the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
[1379.16 --> 1384.16]  he shall be a judge between nations and shall arbitrate many peoples
[1384.16 --> 1390.16]  they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks
[1390.16 --> 1394.16]  nation shall not lift up sword against nation
[1394.16 --> 1397.16]  neither shall they learn war anymore
[1397.16 --> 1404.16]  O house of Jacob come let us walk in the light of the Lord
[1404.16 --> 1410.16]  let us ask God to help us become a channel of this peace through him
[1410.16 --> 1412.16]  please sing with me
[1412.16 --> 1414.16]  make me a channel of your peace
[1414.16 --> 1431.16]  make me a channel of your peace
[1431.16 --> 1438.16]  where there is hatred let me bring your love
[1438.16 --> 1445.16]  when there is injury or pardon Lord
[1445.16 --> 1451.16]  and where there is doubt true faith in you
[1451.16 --> 1457.16]  make me a channel of your peace
[1457.16 --> 1464.16]  when there is despair in life let me bring hope
[1464.16 --> 1470.16]  where there is darkness only light
[1470.16 --> 1476.16]  and where there is sadness ever joy
[1476.16 --> 1483.16]  O master glad that I may never see
[1483.16 --> 1489.16]  so much to be good so lest in the soul
[1489.16 --> 1495.16]  to be understood as to understand
[1495.16 --> 1503.16]  to be loved as to love with all my soul
[1503.16 --> 1509.16]  make me a channel of your peace
[1509.16 --> 1516.16]  it is in pardoning and we are pardoned
[1516.16 --> 1522.16]  in giving of ourselves and we receive
[1522.16 --> 1528.16]  and in dying that we are pardoned eternal life
[1528.16 --> 1541.16]  at this point the kids from ages 3 through grade 5
[1541.16 --> 1544.16]  can head off to Sunday school or rather kids life
[1544.16 --> 1547.16]  and continue worshipping God in the way that they do best
[1547.16 --> 1549.16]  and please be blessed as you go
[1549.16 --> 1553.16]  and now I'd like to invite up Pastor Albert Chu
[1553.16 --> 1557.16]  to the pulpit to bring us God's word from Psalm 121
[1557.16 --> 1560.16]  Pastor Albert of course is led here many times
[1560.16 --> 1563.16]  us through scripture and comes from the tapestry
[1563.16 --> 1566.16]  where he serves as a lead pastor there
[1570.16 --> 1572.16]  Good morning everyone
[1572.16 --> 1574.16]  Ryan's a bit taller than I am
[1574.16 --> 1576.16]  so I have to change the mic a little bit
[1576.16 --> 1578.16]  so good to be here again
[1578.16 --> 1580.16]  I try to get out here once a year
[1580.16 --> 1583.16]  and when Jason invited me I said yes
[1583.16 --> 1586.16]  I can't wait to be back at Ladner CRC
[1586.16 --> 1588.16]  today I don't know what you've been doing
[1588.16 --> 1590.16]  in your sermon series and so forth
[1590.16 --> 1592.16]  but I thought we'd take a break from whatever that is
[1592.16 --> 1594.16]  or maybe you're in the Psalms I have no idea
[1594.16 --> 1597.16]  but we're going to take a look at one of my favourite Psalms
[1597.16 --> 1600.16]  of all time Psalm 121
[1600.16 --> 1601.16]  so we're going to read it together
[1601.16 --> 1603.16]  and I think it'll be up on the screen
[1603.16 --> 1604.16]  there it is
[1604.16 --> 1606.16]  and so we're going to divide it into two
[1606.16 --> 1609.16]  so John and Bev you're going to be on this side
[1609.16 --> 1610.16]  how's that
[1610.16 --> 1612.16]  and everyone else is going to be on that side
[1612.16 --> 1614.16]  and since I just moved you on this side
[1614.16 --> 1616.16]  we're going to call this side the odd side
[1616.16 --> 1617.16]  okay
[1617.16 --> 1618.16]  so you
[1618.16 --> 1619.16]  yeah I know
[1619.16 --> 1620.16]  sorry I had to do that
[1620.16 --> 1623.16]  so verses 1, 3, 5 and 7
[1623.16 --> 1625.16]  yeah the odd side
[1625.16 --> 1626.16]  and you're going to be the even side
[1626.16 --> 1629.16]  so you're going to read verses 2, 4, 6 and 8
[1629.16 --> 1630.16]  alright
[1630.16 --> 1631.16]  so would you please stand
[1631.16 --> 1633.16]  for the reading of God's word
[1633.16 --> 1637.16]  so starting from the odd side
[1637.16 --> 1638.16]  Psalm 121
[1638.16 --> 1640.16]  a song of ascents
[1640.16 --> 1644.16]  I lift up my eyes to the mountains
[1644.16 --> 1647.16]  where does my help come from?
[1647.16 --> 1649.16]  my help comes from the Lord
[1649.16 --> 1652.16]  the baker of the island and earth
[1652.16 --> 1655.16]  he will not beg your foot slur
[1655.16 --> 1659.16]  he who watches over you will not storm
[1659.16 --> 1663.16]  indeed he who watches over Israel
[1663.16 --> 1666.16]  what might his thunder and our sea
[1666.16 --> 1669.16]  the Lord watches over you
[1669.16 --> 1673.16]  the Lord is your shade at your right hand
[1673.16 --> 1676.16]  the sun will not harm you by day
[1676.16 --> 1678.16]  nor the moon by night
[1678.16 --> 1681.16]  the Lord will keep you from all harm
[1681.16 --> 1684.16]  he will watch over your world
[1684.16 --> 1688.16]  the Lord will watch over your coming and going
[1688.16 --> 1691.16]  both now and forevermore
[1691.16 --> 1692.16]  amen
[1692.16 --> 1693.16]  the word of the Lord
[1693.16 --> 1695.16]  please have a seat
[1695.16 --> 1698.16]  isn't that just a fantastic psalm
[1698.16 --> 1700.16]  one that many of us know
[1700.16 --> 1703.16]  this psalm if you look back at the beginning
[1703.16 --> 1705.16]  is entitled a song of steps
[1705.16 --> 1707.16]  at least that's what it is in the original Hebrew
[1707.16 --> 1710.16]  it's translated as a song of ascents
[1710.16 --> 1712.16]  now what does that mean?
[1712.16 --> 1715.16]  well this psalm is a part of group of 15 psalms
[1715.16 --> 1717.16]  from Psalm 120 to Psalm 134
[1717.16 --> 1719.16]  that would be sung by Jews
[1719.16 --> 1721.16]  on their way to Jerusalem
[1721.16 --> 1724.16]  on one of their special annual festivals
[1724.16 --> 1727.16]  altogether there were seven important Jewish festivals
[1727.16 --> 1729.16]  but three were especially important
[1729.16 --> 1731.16]  and marked as especially important
[1731.16 --> 1733.16]  they were the Pentecost
[1733.16 --> 1735.16]  Feast of Tabernacles or Sukkot
[1735.16 --> 1737.16]  and of course Passover
[1737.16 --> 1741.16]  now these three were called the Pilgrim Festivals
[1741.16 --> 1742.16]  festivals
[1742.16 --> 1743.16]  because according to the Torah
[1743.16 --> 1746.16]  every single male Jew was required to go to Jerusalem
[1746.16 --> 1747.16]  three times a year
[1747.16 --> 1750.16]  for these three important festivals
[1750.16 --> 1752.16]  and it would be these particular psalms
[1752.16 --> 1753.16]  the Psalms of Ascent
[1753.16 --> 1757.16]  that pilgrims would sing on their way to this journey
[1757.16 --> 1759.16]  now they were called the Psalms of Ascent
[1759.16 --> 1761.16]  because not only did they have to ascend
[1761.16 --> 1764.16]  in order to meet God in a spiritual sense
[1764.16 --> 1768.16]  but also to ascend in a physical or geographical sense as well
[1768.16 --> 1771.16]  for Jerusalem was built on top of a mountain
[1771.16 --> 1773.16]  it was the highest city in the entire country
[1773.16 --> 1776.16]  and so you had to ascend to get up there
[1776.16 --> 1777.16]  now here's a map of Israel
[1777.16 --> 1778.16]  next slide
[1778.16 --> 1780.16]  and it's you know your normal map of Israel
[1780.16 --> 1781.16]  which we note
[1781.16 --> 1785.16]  but unfortunately this map doesn't show the typography of Israel
[1785.16 --> 1787.16]  so next slide if you do that
[1787.16 --> 1789.16]  so as you can tell I've got my trusty pointer
[1789.16 --> 1791.16]  you guys are in a treat today
[1791.16 --> 1793.16]  so if you live on the coast
[1793.16 --> 1796.16]  you actually have to go up 744 meters to get up to Jerusalem
[1796.16 --> 1799.16]  because again Jerusalem is the tallest part in the country
[1799.16 --> 1801.16]  and over here with the Dead Sea
[1801.16 --> 1802.16]  and where Jericho is
[1802.16 --> 1805.16]  you know the Dead Sea is the lowest part in the world as we know
[1805.16 --> 1810.16]  so from Jericho you actually had to climb up the mountains to get to Jerusalem
[1810.16 --> 1815.16]  so basically you had to ascend to get up to Jerusalem
[1815.16 --> 1818.16]  and then you had to ascend to get to the Temple Mount
[1818.16 --> 1821.16]  and then you had to ascend to get up to the Temple
[1821.16 --> 1825.16]  so the Temple being the tallest part of the country
[1825.16 --> 1827.16]  so that's what you had to do
[1827.16 --> 1829.16]  so therefore the songs of ascent
[1829.16 --> 1834.16]  and in all likelihood this then was a psalm that Jesus himself first sang
[1834.16 --> 1836.16]  when he was 12 years old
[1836.16 --> 1839.16]  and made his first pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his parents
[1839.16 --> 1843.16]  and some of you may remember that story about how Jesus got lost at the Temple
[1843.16 --> 1845.16]  when he was 13 years old
[1845.16 --> 1848.16]  well Jesus would have sung this song on pilgrimage
[1848.16 --> 1849.16]  the one we just read
[1849.16 --> 1853.16]  and many people to this day continue to recite Psalm 121
[1853.16 --> 1855.16]  in the beginning of their journey
[1855.16 --> 1857.16]  it's a traveling psalm
[1857.16 --> 1859.16]  it's a psalm for the road
[1859.16 --> 1861.16]  so let's take our time and unpack it
[1861.16 --> 1862.16]  verse 1
[1862.16 --> 1864.16]  Psalm 1 begins with a question
[1864.16 --> 1867.16]  I lift my eyes up to the mountain
[1867.16 --> 1870.16]  where does my help come from
[1870.16 --> 1871.16]  now if you think about it
[1871.16 --> 1873.16]  the question doesn't actually make sense
[1873.16 --> 1875.16]  because why would I need help
[1875.16 --> 1876.16]  because when I read
[1876.16 --> 1878.16]  I lift my eyes up to the mountain
[1878.16 --> 1882.16]  is it usually associated with a good thing or a bad thing
[1882.16 --> 1884.16]  I lift my eyes up to the mountain
[1884.16 --> 1886.16]  is that a positive statement or a negative one
[1886.16 --> 1889.16]  it's a positive one right
[1889.16 --> 1890.16]  I would think
[1890.16 --> 1891.16]  because I don't know about you
[1891.16 --> 1893.16]  but every single time I look up to the mountains
[1893.16 --> 1896.16]  I am reminded of the bigness of God
[1896.16 --> 1899.16]  my wife and I are avid campers and hikers
[1899.16 --> 1902.16]  and we especially love the national parks down in the United States
[1902.16 --> 1905.16]  and one of our favorite places is Yosemite National Park
[1905.16 --> 1907.16]  how many of you have been there?
[1907.16 --> 1908.16]  yeah it's beautiful right?
[1908.16 --> 1911.16]  so this is a picture I took of my wife, Frida, in it
[1911.16 --> 1913.16]  it's just the back of her
[1913.16 --> 1914.16]  but it's this beautiful picture
[1914.16 --> 1916.16]  you get El Capitan there
[1916.16 --> 1918.16]  you get Half Dome, Bridal Veil Falls
[1918.16 --> 1920.16]  it's one of my favorite pictures
[1920.16 --> 1923.16]  because mountains demand our attention
[1923.16 --> 1925.16]  our reverence, our humility
[1925.16 --> 1928.16]  mountains majestically point upwards towards God
[1928.16 --> 1932.16]  have you ever noticed how God frequently reveals himself on top of mountains?
[1932.16 --> 1935.16]  the first rainbow appeared before Noah on top of Mount Ararat
[1935.16 --> 1939.16]  the Ten Commandments are given to Moses and the Israelites on Mount Sinai
[1939.16 --> 1944.16]  Elijah courageously faces the prophets of Baal and winds on Mount Carmel
[1944.16 --> 1945.16]  Jesus was transfigured
[1945.16 --> 1948.16]  his face shone like the sun on Mount Tabor
[1948.16 --> 1951.16]  no wonder the Jews often called God El Shaddai
[1951.16 --> 1956.16]  which means God Almighty or better yet God of the mountain
[1956.16 --> 1959.16]  I lift my eyes to the mountain is a positive statement
[1959.16 --> 1964.16]  but it would seem in this psalm it can be a negative one too
[1964.16 --> 1968.16]  because mountains not only are a place of beauty
[1968.16 --> 1971.16]  but they are also a place of danger
[1971.16 --> 1973.16]  back to Yosemite
[1973.16 --> 1976.16]  the reason why we were there a few years back
[1976.16 --> 1978.16]  years back was that we had won the lottery
[1978.16 --> 1981.16]  and were able to hike up the iconic Half Dome
[1981.16 --> 1982.16]  so next slide
[1982.16 --> 1984.16]  here's a picture of Half Dome
[1984.16 --> 1985.16]  it's familiar right?
[1985.16 --> 1986.16]  I mean some of it
[1986.16 --> 1988.16]  it's the Yosemite operating system in Apple
[1988.16 --> 1989.16]  if you remember that
[1989.16 --> 1991.16]  but it's also the logo for the north face
[1991.16 --> 1994.16]  so that's Half Dome
[1994.16 --> 1995.16]  but next slide
[1995.16 --> 1997.16]  is how the hike ends
[1997.16 --> 2000.16]  altogether it's a 26 kilometer hike
[2000.16 --> 2003.16]  with a total elevation of 4,800 feet
[2003.16 --> 2004.16]  to get on top of Half Dome
[2004.16 --> 2006.16]  including the last 400 feet
[2006.16 --> 2009.16]  in which you need the help of two metal cables to get in it
[2009.16 --> 2011.16]  and I don't know if you can tell
[2011.16 --> 2012.16]  it's a little...oh back, back, back
[2012.16 --> 2013.16]  okay
[2013.16 --> 2015.16]  so here are some people
[2015.16 --> 2017.16]  and here is this metal ladder
[2017.16 --> 2020.16]  that you actually have to climb the last 400 feet
[2020.16 --> 2021.16]  to get to the top
[2021.16 --> 2024.16]  now going up is one thing
[2024.16 --> 2028.16]  most hikers take 10 to 12 hours to finish the entire hike from the very bottom
[2028.16 --> 2034.16]  and again you have to enter into a lottery in order to win it
[2034.16 --> 2038.16]  it doesn't feel like winning because here's the next slide of what it looks like from the top
[2038.16 --> 2041.16]  I know
[2041.16 --> 2043.16]  thinking about hiking up Half Dome
[2043.16 --> 2047.16]  and those words in Psalm 121 have an entirely different meaning doesn't it?
[2047.16 --> 2050.16]  I lift my eyes up to the mountain
[2050.16 --> 2052.16]  oh dear
[2052.16 --> 2055.16]  where does my help come from?
[2055.16 --> 2057.16]  unfortunately
[2057.16 --> 2058.16]  or thankfully
[2058.16 --> 2060.16]  however you want to put it
[2060.16 --> 2061.16]  due to weather that year
[2061.16 --> 2063.16]  all the snow had yet to melt
[2063.16 --> 2067.16]  and so they weren't able to open up the hike until two weeks after our visit
[2067.16 --> 2068.16]  and to be honest
[2068.16 --> 2069.16]  I was relieved
[2069.16 --> 2073.16]  because hiking up a mountain can be scary
[2073.16 --> 2078.16]  it's not only physically demanding but you're never sure about rock slides or inclement weather
[2078.16 --> 2081.16]  the weather can change in an instant up on the mountain
[2081.16 --> 2085.16]  and what about bandits or thieves that might be hiding behind the next bend
[2085.16 --> 2087.16]  but bad things can happen on the road
[2087.16 --> 2089.16]  for instance in the story of the Good Samaritan
[2089.16 --> 2092.16]  where was the person when he got mugged beaten and left for dead?
[2092.16 --> 2097.16]  yeah on the road walking up from Jericho to Jerusalem
[2097.16 --> 2100.16]  there's always danger on the road
[2100.16 --> 2102.16]  and I haven't even started talking about wild animals
[2102.16 --> 2104.16]  wolves, rattlesnakes and bears
[2104.16 --> 2108.16]  I've lost count how many times on my backpacking trips I ran into a bear
[2108.16 --> 2112.16]  just like two months ago
[2112.16 --> 2114.16]  yeah on Elfin Lakes up in Garibaldi
[2114.16 --> 2115.16]  when I went up there
[2115.16 --> 2120.16]  I did not see one, two, three, but four black bears on my journey up the mountain
[2120.16 --> 2124.16]  and the closest one was maybe eight meters away
[2124.16 --> 2128.16]  there is always danger in the road
[2128.16 --> 2130.16]  and I think that speaks to all of us
[2130.16 --> 2132.16]  no matter where we're going
[2132.16 --> 2135.16]  aren't we always anxious on the start of a trip?
[2135.16 --> 2137.16]  did I pack everything I need?
[2137.16 --> 2140.16]  do I have my passport, my money, my tickets?
[2140.16 --> 2142.16]  do I have my maps? I hope I don't get lost
[2142.16 --> 2144.16]  I hope we don't get into an accident
[2144.16 --> 2146.16]  oh I hope I don't get sick
[2146.16 --> 2148.16]  there's always anxiety isn't there?
[2148.16 --> 2150.16]  at the beginning of a trip
[2150.16 --> 2154.16]  and in this case not only were the mountains a place of danger
[2154.16 --> 2156.16]  but in the context of the psalm
[2156.16 --> 2157.16]  pagan shrines
[2157.16 --> 2159.16]  you see it was in the high places
[2159.16 --> 2161.16]  that the worship places of Baal would be
[2161.16 --> 2163.16]  Baal temples and Asherah poles
[2163.16 --> 2165.16]  and all the weird stuff that would happen
[2165.16 --> 2167.16]  associated with their worship of Baal
[2167.16 --> 2169.16]  so maybe this is a plea
[2169.16 --> 2172.16]  with all the different gods and religions out there
[2172.16 --> 2174.16]  where will my help come from?
[2174.16 --> 2176.16]  who's going to help me?
[2176.16 --> 2178.16]  thankfully
[2178.16 --> 2182.16]  the answer to that question is found immediately in verse 2
[2182.16 --> 2183.16]  which reads
[2183.16 --> 2185.16]  my help comes from the Lord
[2185.16 --> 2188.16]  the maker of heaven and earth
[2188.16 --> 2190.16]  our help doesn't come from the hills
[2190.16 --> 2192.16]  our help doesn't come from the pagan gods on those hills
[2192.16 --> 2194.16]  no our help comes from the God who made the hills
[2194.16 --> 2196.16]  who made you and me
[2196.16 --> 2197.16]  who made heaven and earth
[2197.16 --> 2200.16]  our help comes from the God who made everything
[2200.16 --> 2203.16]  and not only that in verse 3 it reads
[2203.16 --> 2205.16]  he will not let your foot slip
[2205.16 --> 2208.16]  he who watches over you will not slumber
[2208.16 --> 2212.16]  indeed he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep
[2212.16 --> 2216.16]  during Bible times people usually traveled in caravans together
[2216.16 --> 2218.16]  in order to protect themselves from thieves
[2218.16 --> 2221.16]  and they would take turns staying awake at night
[2221.16 --> 2223.16]  watching out for possible attacks
[2223.16 --> 2227.16]  in the same way God the watchman does not sleep
[2227.16 --> 2229.16]  he doesn't doze off he doesn't get tired
[2229.16 --> 2232.16]  he doesn't lose focus he doesn't fall asleep
[2232.16 --> 2233.16]  he persistently
[2233.16 --> 2234.16]  constantly
[2234.16 --> 2236.16]  watches over you
[2236.16 --> 2238.16]  the verse continues in verse 5
[2238.16 --> 2240.16]  the Lord watches over you
[2240.16 --> 2242.16]  the Lord is your shade at your right hand
[2242.16 --> 2245.16]  the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night
[2245.16 --> 2249.16]  in verse 6 the psalmist introduces two sets of opposites
[2249.16 --> 2251.16]  the first is the sun and moon
[2251.16 --> 2253.16]  the second set is the day and night
[2253.16 --> 2255.16]  we know especially in the Middle East
[2255.16 --> 2257.16]  that the sun can be dangerous
[2257.16 --> 2261.16]  right? sunstroke, dehydration
[2261.16 --> 2263.16]  but what about the moon?
[2263.16 --> 2265.16]  how scary is the moon?
[2265.16 --> 2267.16]  well in the ancient Near East
[2267.16 --> 2271.16]  the people believed that the moon had strange power over one's emotions
[2271.16 --> 2273.16]  and I think the same is true for us today
[2273.16 --> 2277.16]  after all have you heard of the term moon struck?
[2277.16 --> 2279.16]  in a recent study
[2279.16 --> 2285.16]  80% of nurses and 63% of doctors assert that hospital emergency rooms
[2285.16 --> 2288.16]  are busier on nights when there is a full moon
[2288.16 --> 2290.16]  why is that?
[2290.16 --> 2294.16]  by the way this is where we get the term lunatic from the word lunar
[2294.16 --> 2298.16]  so in the original Hebrew this verse is written as a chiasm
[2298.16 --> 2300.16]  a chiasm is a literary structure found throughout the Bible
[2300.16 --> 2302.16]  it's kind of like an accordion
[2302.16 --> 2303.16]  so next slide
[2303.16 --> 2306.16]  so it's kind of like an accordion or if you want to like think about it
[2306.16 --> 2307.16]  a hamburger
[2307.16 --> 2310.16]  you know you got the bun you got the sauce or lettuce and tomatoes
[2310.16 --> 2313.16]  but the good stuff the meat is in the middle
[2313.16 --> 2317.16]  and so the most important part is the middle of the chiasm
[2317.16 --> 2319.16]  and in this case it's the phrase
[2319.16 --> 2322.16]  will not harm you
[2322.16 --> 2324.16]  the sun
[2324.16 --> 2325.16]  the moon
[2325.16 --> 2327.16]  the day
[2327.16 --> 2328.16]  the night
[2328.16 --> 2334.16]  nothing will harm you for God continues 24-7 to watch over you
[2334.16 --> 2338.16]  it is this word watch that shows up over and over again in the psalm
[2338.16 --> 2340.16]  six times in these eight verses
[2340.16 --> 2342.16]  it's the Hebrew word shamar
[2342.16 --> 2347.16]  and I don't know why the translators of the NIV decided to use two different words for the same Hebrew word
[2347.16 --> 2350.16]  five times it uses the word watch and the other time keep
[2350.16 --> 2351.16]  but it's the same word
[2351.16 --> 2359.16]  nevertheless whatever it's translated in English this word shamar in Hebrew is not a passive watching
[2359.16 --> 2362.16]  it conveys more of a sense of an active watching over
[2362.16 --> 2364.16]  or better yet of guarding
[2364.16 --> 2366.16]  of keeping safe
[2366.16 --> 2367.16]  of preserving
[2367.16 --> 2368.16]  of protecting
[2368.16 --> 2369.16]  and I love that
[2369.16 --> 2370.16]  that God keeps
[2370.16 --> 2371.16]  preserves
[2371.16 --> 2372.16]  protects
[2372.16 --> 2374.16]  and continues to keep us safe
[2374.16 --> 2377.16]  God is the shamar of Israel
[2377.16 --> 2379.16]  but not only Israel
[2379.16 --> 2381.16]  but each and every one of us
[2381.16 --> 2386.16]  in the first four verses the focus is us corporately as a people as a nation
[2386.16 --> 2388.16]  God watches over Israel
[2388.16 --> 2390.16]  God watches over Ladner CRC
[2390.16 --> 2392.16]  but starting in verse five
[2392.16 --> 2394.16]  there's a shift in the noun
[2394.16 --> 2396.16]  God personalizes it
[2396.16 --> 2398.16]  it becomes singular
[2398.16 --> 2400.16]  God doesn't only watch over Israel
[2400.16 --> 2403.16]  but he watches over you individually
[2403.16 --> 2405.16]  what a powerful way to read this song
[2405.16 --> 2407.16]  here's the song again next slide
[2407.16 --> 2409.16]  but we're gonna look at verse five
[2409.16 --> 2411.16]  and it starts like this
[2411.16 --> 2412.16]  the Lord it's capitalized
[2412.16 --> 2413.16]  the Lord Yahweh
[2413.16 --> 2415.16]  his own personal name
[2415.16 --> 2417.16]  watches over you
[2417.16 --> 2419.16]  Albert
[2419.16 --> 2420.16]  and Joe
[2420.16 --> 2421.16]  and Mel
[2421.16 --> 2422.16]  and Bev
[2422.16 --> 2424.16]  and Serena
[2424.16 --> 2426.16]  the Lord fill in your name
[2426.16 --> 2428.16]  the Lord is your shade
[2428.16 --> 2430.16]  at your right hand
[2430.16 --> 2432.16]  the sun will not harm you
[2432.16 --> 2434.16]  by day
[2434.16 --> 2436.16]  nor the moon by night
[2436.16 --> 2438.16]  the Lord will keep you
[2438.16 --> 2440.16]  from all harm
[2440.16 --> 2443.16]  he will watch over your life
[2443.16 --> 2446.16]  the Lord will watch over your comings and goings
[2446.16 --> 2449.16]  both now and forevermore
[2449.16 --> 2451.16]  what a great psalm isn't it
[2451.16 --> 2455.16]  whether you are about to set out on the coquihalla in your minivan
[2455.16 --> 2457.16]  or on a runway in a 747
[2457.16 --> 2459.16]  whether you're just going down to Seattle
[2459.16 --> 2461.16]  or you're off to the Netherlands
[2461.16 --> 2463.16]  or if it's a walk on the dike
[2463.16 --> 2464.16]  or a hike up the north shore
[2464.16 --> 2466.16]  it's a psalm we can pray
[2466.16 --> 2468.16]  but this psalm
[2468.16 --> 2472.16]  is not only limited to a geographical journey
[2472.16 --> 2475.16]  the last two verses suggest a wider application
[2475.16 --> 2476.16]  verse seven
[2476.16 --> 2478.16]  the Lord will keep you from all harm
[2478.16 --> 2480.16]  he will watch over your life
[2480.16 --> 2483.16]  the Lord will watch over your comings and goings
[2483.16 --> 2484.16]  when?
[2484.16 --> 2486.16]  both now
[2486.16 --> 2488.16]  and forevermore
[2488.16 --> 2492.16]  God watches and protects us throughout our entire life
[2492.16 --> 2494.16]  for life itself is a journey isn't it?
[2494.16 --> 2496.16]  all our comings and goings
[2496.16 --> 2498.16]  both now and forevermore
[2498.16 --> 2501.16]  implying that God will not only watch us in life
[2501.16 --> 2503.16]  but also in death
[2503.16 --> 2505.16]  what an amazing promise this is
[2505.16 --> 2507.16]  that God will watch over us in our death too
[2507.16 --> 2509.16]  that through the work of Jesus
[2509.16 --> 2510.16]  and what he did on the cross
[2510.16 --> 2513.16]  nothing, nothing will separate us from the immense
[2513.16 --> 2516.16]  watchful presence of God
[2516.16 --> 2519.16]  the first time I ever preached on this psalm
[2519.16 --> 2520.16]  was a number of years ago
[2520.16 --> 2522.16]  the funeral of my father-in-law
[2522.16 --> 2525.16]  Peter Newdorf did not have an easy life
[2525.16 --> 2528.16]  he was born right before the start of World War II
[2528.16 --> 2531.16]  in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic
[2531.16 --> 2534.16]  lived as a refugee in post-war Germany
[2534.16 --> 2536.16]  was sponsored finally to come to Canada
[2536.16 --> 2539.16]  lost his first wife to an aneurysm
[2539.16 --> 2541.16]  had dementia in his later years
[2541.16 --> 2543.16]  oh, and to top it off
[2543.16 --> 2544.16]  he had me as a son-in-law
[2544.16 --> 2548.16]  so certainly not an easy life
[2548.16 --> 2550.16]  but through it all
[2550.16 --> 2552.16]  God was watching over him
[2552.16 --> 2555.16]  one particular story encapsulates it for me
[2555.16 --> 2557.16]  was on February 13th 1945
[2557.16 --> 2559.16]  that Peter and his family were on a journey
[2559.16 --> 2562.16]  a train bound for the city of Dresden in Germany
[2562.16 --> 2564.16]  for no known reason
[2564.16 --> 2566.16]  Red Cross personnel persuaded them to disembark
[2566.16 --> 2569.16]  before the train arrived into Dresden
[2569.16 --> 2571.16]  and thank goodness for that
[2571.16 --> 2575.16]  for on that very night that they were scheduled to arrive into town
[2575.16 --> 2579.16]  722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force
[2579.16 --> 2582.16]  and 527 of the United States Air Force
[2582.16 --> 2587.16]  dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs on the city
[2587.16 --> 2589.16]  he knew what it meant
[2589.16 --> 2592.16]  for the Lord is your shade at your right hand
[2592.16 --> 2594.16]  indeed
[2594.16 --> 2597.16]  what a promise this psalm was to him through his life
[2597.16 --> 2600.16]  and for those of us who grieved his death
[2600.16 --> 2604.16]  that the Lord will keep watch over your coming and going
[2604.16 --> 2607.16]  both now and forever more
[2607.16 --> 2610.16]  speaking of a death
[2610.16 --> 2613.16]  it's been a hard couple of months for me personally
[2613.16 --> 2616.16]  I lost a good friend to cancer just a few years
[2616.16 --> 2617.16]  a few months ago
[2617.16 --> 2620.16]  and a member of our Richmond campus congregation
[2620.16 --> 2622.16]  suddenly passed away a few weeks ago
[2622.16 --> 2624.16]  within two months of finding out they had cancer
[2624.16 --> 2627.16]  both of these guys under 50
[2627.16 --> 2630.16]  leave a wife and two young kids
[2630.16 --> 2632.16]  it's heartbreaking
[2632.16 --> 2635.16]  and I know that there was a funeral here
[2635.16 --> 2637.16]  memorial service just yesterday
[2637.16 --> 2639.16]  and I wish I came
[2639.16 --> 2641.16]  Michael Joyce's son
[2641.16 --> 2642.16]  and I have known each other
[2642.16 --> 2644.16]  and I saw him every week
[2644.16 --> 2646.16]  for the last 10-15 years
[2646.16 --> 2648.16]  volunteering at Bethesda
[2648.16 --> 2651.16]  that's why I need this psalm
[2651.16 --> 2654.16]  that's why we need this psalm
[2654.16 --> 2656.16]  Psalm 121
[2656.16 --> 2658.16]  this ongoing reminder
[2658.16 --> 2660.16]  that God is always there
[2660.16 --> 2662.16]  persistent alive
[2662.16 --> 2664.16]  guarding watching over us
[2664.16 --> 2666.16]  through all our comings and goings
[2666.16 --> 2668.16]  both now and forever more
[2668.16 --> 2670.16]  not only in this life
[2670.16 --> 2672.16]  but the life everlasting
[2672.16 --> 2674.16]  we have this amazing assurance
[2674.16 --> 2676.16]  that there is victory over sin
[2676.16 --> 2678.16]  and death through Jesus
[2678.16 --> 2680.16]  that death is not the final word
[2680.16 --> 2683.16]  Jesus is the final word
[2683.16 --> 2686.16]  now I want to make an important caveat here
[2686.16 --> 2688.16]  God does indeed watch over us
[2688.16 --> 2690.16]  but this doesn't mean that we won't get
[2690.16 --> 2691.16]  sprained ankles get sunstroke
[2691.16 --> 2692.16]  or experience suffering
[2692.16 --> 2694.16]  there's this myth out there that sometimes
[2694.16 --> 2697.16]  as Christians no harm will ever come to us
[2697.16 --> 2699.16]  yet we will all go through things
[2699.16 --> 2702.16]  illness financial hardship divorce depression
[2702.16 --> 2704.16]  addiction grief
[2704.16 --> 2706.16]  with the psalmist we may often
[2706.16 --> 2708.16]  find ourselves looking up to God
[2708.16 --> 2709.16]  and going oh
[2709.16 --> 2712.16]  where does my help come from
[2712.16 --> 2714.16]  when illness comes
[2714.16 --> 2715.16]  when anxiety threatens
[2715.16 --> 2716.16]  when tragedy happens
[2716.16 --> 2718.16]  we can often come to the conclusion
[2718.16 --> 2720.16]  that God has gotten bored
[2720.16 --> 2722.16]  or fallen asleep
[2722.16 --> 2724.16]  or is too busy to do something
[2724.16 --> 2727.16]  that's what this psalm
[2727.16 --> 2729.16]  prevents us to think like
[2729.16 --> 2733.16]  this psalm reminds us that God is always
[2733.16 --> 2735.16]  always present
[2735.16 --> 2737.16]  especially in those hard times
[2737.16 --> 2739.16]  when I look at the difficult times
[2739.16 --> 2740.16]  that I faced in my life
[2740.16 --> 2741.16]  I've come to the realization
[2741.16 --> 2743.16]  that God never slumbered
[2743.16 --> 2744.16]  day or night
[2744.16 --> 2745.16]  that God has been watching
[2745.16 --> 2747.16]  and looking after me the entire time
[2747.16 --> 2750.16]  I mean how many times have you looked back
[2750.16 --> 2751.16]  and you remember
[2751.16 --> 2752.16]  especially during hard times
[2752.16 --> 2753.16]  when you look back
[2753.16 --> 2756.16]  and you realize God was there
[2756.16 --> 2759.16]  it didn't seem like it at first
[2759.16 --> 2761.16]  but God was there
[2761.16 --> 2764.16]  he met you when you needed him most
[2764.16 --> 2766.16]  he provided
[2766.16 --> 2767.16]  he was present
[2767.16 --> 2770.16]  that's why we need to pray this psalm
[2770.16 --> 2771.16]  that's why we need to memorize this psalm
[2771.16 --> 2773.16]  to remind us that God is always watching over us
[2773.16 --> 2774.16]  year to year
[2774.16 --> 2775.16]  month to month
[2775.16 --> 2776.16]  day by day
[2776.16 --> 2777.16]  hour by hour
[2777.16 --> 2778.16]  minute by minute
[2778.16 --> 2779.16]  second by second even
[2779.16 --> 2780.16]  he is here
[2780.16 --> 2782.16]  God watches over us
[2782.16 --> 2784.16]  in fact friends
[2784.16 --> 2785.16]  do you realize
[2785.16 --> 2788.16]  that you are as safe right now with God
[2788.16 --> 2790.16]  as you will be
[2790.16 --> 2792.16]  when you are with him in heaven
[2792.16 --> 2795.16]  that you are as safe right now
[2795.16 --> 2798.16]  as you will be in heaven
[2798.16 --> 2800.16]  that you are as safe right now
[2800.16 --> 2802.16]  as you ever will be
[2802.16 --> 2807.16]  for we are always always under the watchful presence of God
[2807.16 --> 2809.16]  so let me conclude
[2809.16 --> 2814.16]  there are many metaphors we are used to describe our relationship with God
[2814.16 --> 2817.16]  for instance God is described in the Bible as being our good shepherd
[2817.16 --> 2822.16]  God is also described as our being our bridegroom God is our rock shield and refuge
[2822.16 --> 2827.16]  but one of my favorite ways of thinking about God recently and as exemplified in this psalm
[2827.16 --> 2830.16]  is God as my walking partner
[2830.16 --> 2835.16]  that especially since the pandemic as I've really been able to focus on spiritual rhythms
[2835.16 --> 2839.16]  I've done a lot and I mean a lot of walking
[2839.16 --> 2843.16]  my wife kids around and calls me Walker Betty Crocker
[2846.16 --> 2848.16]  God desires to walk alongside us
[2848.16 --> 2851.16]  and it actually started in the beginning
[2851.16 --> 2853.16]  in the beginning God created heaven and the earth
[2853.16 --> 2854.16]  he created Adam and Eve
[2854.16 --> 2858.16]  and in Genesis 2 we read that he walked with them in the garden
[2858.16 --> 2861.16]  in Genesis 5 we read that God walked with Enoch
[2861.16 --> 2864.16]  in Genesis 6 we read that he walked with Noah
[2864.16 --> 2867.16]  in Genesis 17 God calls Abraham to walk with him
[2867.16 --> 2872.16]  there's this fantastic verse in Leviticus 26 that encapsulates God's desire
[2872.16 --> 2876.16]  it says I will be among I will walk sorry among you and be your God
[2876.16 --> 2878.16]  and you will be my people
[2878.16 --> 2883.16]  and of course here in Psalm 121 God walking with us in our life journey
[2884.16 --> 2886.16]  there is something about walking with someone isn't there
[2886.16 --> 2890.16]  yes there's a physical proximity but there is much much more than that
[2890.16 --> 2895.16]  when you walk along someone there is dialogue there's intimacy there's relationship and trust
[2895.16 --> 2900.16]  what does it mean for God to walk with us
[2900.16 --> 2903.16]  it's no surprise when you do a word study in the Bible about this idea
[2903.16 --> 2908.16]  that the person found walking around the most is none other than Jesus
[2908.16 --> 2915.16]  he's always walking he walks up to fishermen along the Sea of Galilee and says to them come follow me
[2915.16 --> 2919.16]  he walks from town to town proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God
[2919.16 --> 2924.16]  he meets the ten lepers the blind beggar and Zacchaeus on the journey from Galilee to Jerusalem
[2924.16 --> 2927.16]  and I love how author Tim Chester puts it in Luke's Gospel
[2927.16 --> 2932.16]  Jesus is either going to a meal at a meal or coming from a meal
[2932.16 --> 2936.16]  eating and drinking Jesus is constantly walking from one place to another
[2936.16 --> 2942.16]  and of course there's the Easter story of Jesus walking with two of his disciples on the road to Emmaus
[2942.16 --> 2944.16]  he desires to walk with us
[2945.16 --> 2947.16]  so friends you are not alone
[2948.16 --> 2951.16]  Jesus is walking with us as we speak
[2952.16 --> 2953.16]  back in the Middle Ages
[2954.16 --> 2957.16]  peace people used to go on pilgrimages to the Holy Land
[2958.16 --> 2961.16]  and when they were asked where they were going they would often reply
[2961.16 --> 2964.16]  and my French is terrible but it's a la sante terre
[2965.16 --> 2968.16]  which is the French term to mean to the Holy Land
[2968.16 --> 2970.16]  a la sante terre
[2970.16 --> 2972.16]  walking to the Holy Land
[2973.16 --> 2979.16]  and so people began to know as the become known as santerères or saunterers
[2980.16 --> 2982.16]  that's where we get the word to saunter
[2983.16 --> 2985.16]  what does it mean to saunter
[2985.16 --> 2989.16]  yes saunter means to walk in a slow relaxed manner without hurry
[2990.16 --> 2996.16]  but also to saunter means to recognize the places where we stand and walk
[2997.16 --> 2998.16]  is all holy ground
[2999.16 --> 3004.16]  people places where we can become more present to the people we meet and to the presence of God
[3005.16 --> 3007.16]  so friends here's the application
[3008.16 --> 3010.16]  may we learn to saunter
[3010.16 --> 3011.16]  may we learn to saunter
[3012.16 --> 3014.16]  you don't need to take a pilgrimage to the Holy Land
[3014.16 --> 3016.16]  although I encourage you to do that one day because that will change your life
[3017.16 --> 3020.16]  you don't need to make a pilgrimage to the Camino Santiago
[3021.16 --> 3023.16]  but I hear that's going to change your life
[3024.16 --> 3025.16]  but learn to saunter
[3026.16 --> 3027.16]  around the block
[3028.16 --> 3029.16]  on the dike
[3030.16 --> 3031.16]  on a hike
[3032.16 --> 3033.16]  through the forest
[3034.16 --> 3035.16]  on the sea wall
[3035.16 --> 3036.16]  and I don't know what spiritual rhythms you have in your life
[3037.16 --> 3038.16]  reading, praying, fasting, walking
[3038.16 --> 3040.16]  but what does it mean to saunter
[3041.16 --> 3042.16]  with Jesus
[3043.16 --> 3044.16]  in your life
[3045.16 --> 3047.16]  as we saunter and pray through Psalm 121
[3048.16 --> 3049.16]  in our fears of the future
[3050.16 --> 3053.16]  and I'm not talking about the futures as to what will happen tomorrow or the day after
[3054.16 --> 3055.16]  or even next year
[3055.16 --> 3056.16]  I'm talking future as in future future
[3057.16 --> 3058.16]  do not be afraid
[3059.16 --> 3061.16]  life is a journey
[3062.16 --> 3064.16]  and whatever road you are on may you know
[3065.16 --> 3067.16]  Jesus is right here
[3067.16 --> 3069.16]  in the here and now ever present
[3070.16 --> 3071.16]  and in this journey you are on
[3072.16 --> 3073.16]  it's only the beginning
[3074.16 --> 3075.16]  Jesus wants to walk with you
[3076.16 --> 3078.16]  he wants to be in relationship with you
[3079.16 --> 3081.16]  he wants to be next to you
[3082.16 --> 3084.16]  he wants to look after you
[3085.16 --> 3086.16]  he wants to walk with you
[3087.16 --> 3088.16]  this day
[3089.16 --> 3090.16]  the day after
[3091.16 --> 3092.16]  the day after that
[3092.16 --> 3093.16]  and always
[3093.16 --> 3095.16]  let's pray
[3095.16 --> 3096.16]  let's pray
[3103.16 --> 3105.16]  Father God we lift our eyes to the mountains
[3106.16 --> 3113.16]  with all the trials and things going on in our lives
[3113.16 --> 3114.16]  we look up
[3115.16 --> 3116.16]  we look up
[3117.16 --> 3120.16]  and we ask where does our help come from
[3121.16 --> 3123.16]  and the answer
[3124.16 --> 3125.16]  our help comes from the Lord
[3126.16 --> 3128.16]  the maker of heaven and earth
[3129.16 --> 3130.16]  he will not let your foot slip
[3131.16 --> 3134.16]  he who watches over you will not slumber
[3135.16 --> 3136.16]  indeed he who watches over you
[3137.16 --> 3138.16]  he will neither slumber nor sleep
[3139.16 --> 3140.16]  the Lord watches over you
[3141.16 --> 3143.16]  the Lord is your shade at your right hand
[3144.16 --> 3147.16]  the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night
[3148.16 --> 3149.16]  the Lord will keep you from all harm
[3150.16 --> 3151.16]  he will watch over your life
[3152.16 --> 3154.16]  the Lord will watch over your coming and going
[3155.16 --> 3158.16]  both now and forevermore
[3158.16 --> 3159.16]  and forevermore
[3159.16 --> 3163.16]  amen
[3188.16 --> 3190.16]  I have a maker
[3191.16 --> 3201.16]  before my heart
[3202.16 --> 3206.16]  before me the time began
[3207.16 --> 3209.16]  my life was in his hands
[3209.16 --> 3214.16]  my life was in his hands
[3215.16 --> 3219.16]  he knows my name
[3220.16 --> 3226.16]  he knows my every thought
[3227.16 --> 3232.16]  he sees each tear that falls
[3233.16 --> 3236.16]  and hears me when I call
[3236.16 --> 3239.16]  I have a father
[3239.16 --> 3240.16]  he calls me his own
[3241.16 --> 3244.16]  I have a father
[3245.16 --> 3247.16]  he calls me his own
[3248.16 --> 3250.16]  he'll never leave me
[3251.16 --> 3253.16]  no matter where I go
[3253.16 --> 3256.16]  he knows my name
[3256.16 --> 3259.16]  he knows my every thought
[3259.16 --> 3265.16]  he sees each tear that falls
[3266.16 --> 3268.16]  and hears me when I call
[3268.16 --> 3270.16]  he knows my every thought
[3270.16 --> 3271.16]  he sees each tear that falls
[3271.16 --> 3281.16]  He hears me when I fall
[3281.16 --> 3284.16]  he hears me when I call
[3285.16 --> 3289.16]  he knows my name
[3290.16 --> 3291.16]  he knows my every thought
[3292.16 --> 3293.16]  he sees each tear that falls
[3293.16 --> 3314.16]  he hears me when I call
[3314.16 --> 3315.16]  he knows my death
[3315.16 --> 3316.16]  he knows my every thought
[3316.16 --> 3317.16]  he knows my my heart
[3318.16 --> 3322.16]  he knows where his Cena
[3323.16 --> 3327.16]  at this point I'd like to invite the deacons up
[3328.16 --> 3330.16]  to take this morning's offering
[3330.16 --> 3332.16]  this morning's offering is for Life Water Canada
[3333.16 --> 3336.16]  and it's a ministry that engages in critical work
[3337.16 --> 3338.66]  of drilling wells to bring drinking water
[3339.16 --> 3341.16]  and sanitation water all over Africa
[3341.16 --> 3347.40]  Africa as well as in Haiti. So it goes without saying that this ministry saves lives. So please
[3347.40 --> 3348.12]  give as you're able.
[3371.16 --> 3401.14]  Thank you.
[3401.16 --> 3431.14]  Thank you.
[3431.16 --> 3461.14]  Thank you.
[3461.16 --> 3468.16]  Thank you.
[3468.16 --> 3469.16]  Thank you.
[3469.16 --> 3476.16]  Thank you.
[3476.16 --> 3483.16]  Thank you.
[3483.16 --> 3490.16]  Thank you.
[3490.16 --> 3491.16]  Thank you.
[3491.16 --> 3497.16]  Thank you.
[3497.16 --> 3498.16]  Thank you.
[3498.16 --> 3499.16]  Thank you.
[3499.16 --> 3500.16]  Thank you.
[3500.16 --> 3501.16]  Thank you.
[3501.16 --> 3502.16]  Thank you.
[3502.16 --> 3503.16]  Thank you.
[3531.16 --> 3532.16]  Thank you.
[3532.16 --> 3533.16]  Thank you.
[3533.16 --> 3534.16]  Thank you.
[3534.16 --> 3535.16]  Thank you.
[3535.16 --> 3537.16]  I'm going to do the word of victory.
[3537.16 --> 3543.88]  with a crown of thorns upon his brow, yet sovereign over all the earth. We beg you, Lord,
[3543.88 --> 3550.68]  for justice for those whose lives have been destroyed by warfare and violence. Ukraine,
[3551.64 --> 3563.80]  Russia, Israel, Palestine, Myanmar, Sudan, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali, these places are in need of your
[3563.80 --> 3570.84]  compassion, your justice, and your mercy. Many there have lived their entire lives under violent
[3570.84 --> 3576.60]  oppression, knowing only bitterness, hatred, and bloodshed from a very young age. Help them
[3576.60 --> 3583.32]  instead to know and love their neighbor and to know you, Lord. May their leaders and oppressors
[3583.32 --> 3592.52]  renounce violence and intolerance and turn instead to good things and peace. Teach us all here this
[3592.52 --> 3598.36]  morning to live lives filled with thanksgiving. May we seek justice and harmony for ourselves and for
[3598.36 --> 3605.40]  the whole world and not be tempted by divisiveness, discontent, and selfish anger. We ask you, Lord,
[3605.96 --> 3612.92]  for mercy for those in our congregation affected by sickness or grieving the loss of a loved one.
[3614.44 --> 3620.68]  Our hearts go out to Lena, who mourns the loss of her brother John. And Lord, we also think this
[3620.68 --> 3630.04]  morning of the divorce family as they laid Joyce to rest yesterday. We lift up Pat, Ellie, Grace, Carl,
[3630.60 --> 3641.64]  Amy, Jerry and Anne, Shirley, Diane, Hank and Liz, Ted, Jeanette, and Henry. It is a long list and yet we know
[3641.64 --> 3650.04]  it's not even complete. But you know, Lord, you know each of them by name from the first seconds of life in the
[3650.04 --> 3656.36]  womb. You know their struggles far better than any of us here could possibly ever hope to. Their
[3656.36 --> 3664.60]  suffering is great and we feel utterly helpless. We ask you, Lord, once again to take in and share
[3664.60 --> 3672.28]  the burdens of these people. They are tired, Lord, and need rest. For those struggling against daily pain
[3672.28 --> 3677.32]  and chronic health issues, for those suffering with mental illness, depression, with loneliness,
[3677.32 --> 3685.24]  for those facing the daily effects of old age, we pray. You love them, Lord, and they love you.
[3686.04 --> 3692.20]  May our prayers this morning bring comfort and strength. We ask you, Lord Jesus, come quickly,
[3692.76 --> 3699.56]  heal our broken world, deliver us from evil, and lead us not in temptation. May your kingdom come and
[3699.56 --> 3706.04]  your will be done. We ask this all in the name of the one true living God, through Jesus Christ,
[3706.04 --> 3713.96]  our Redeemer, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I'd like to invite Pastor Elmbrick back up to the
[3713.96 --> 3716.92]  pulpit one more time to give us our parting blessing.
[3716.92 --> 3723.80]  Pastor Elmbrick back up to the pulpit one more time to give us our prayer.
[3723.80 --> 3727.40]  Would you please stand to receive this as your benediction?
[3729.96 --> 3736.36]  As we saunter, may the road rise to meet you. May the wind always be at your back.
[3737.24 --> 3739.16]  The sun shine warm upon your face.
[3739.16 --> 3748.44]  May the rains fall softly upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his hand.
[3748.44 --> 3758.44]  Amen.
[3758.44 --> 3776.12]  Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[3776.12 --> 3785.40]  Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[3785.40 --> 3787.40]  Not ye all else to me, save that thou art.
[3787.40 --> 3792.60]  Thou my best God, my day or my night.
[3792.60 --> 3799.40]  Waking or sleeping, thy presence the light.
[3799.40 --> 3810.44]  Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word.
[3810.44 --> 3818.72]  I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord.
[3819.46 --> 3827.16]  Thou my great Father, so may I be.
[3827.16 --> 3836.16]  Thou in me dwelling, and I one with Thee.
[3838.16 --> 3846.34]  Witches I heed not, nor vain and deep praise.
[3847.06 --> 3854.16]  Thou my inheritance, now and away.
[3854.16 --> 3863.16]  Thou art Thou only first in Thy heart.
[3863.16 --> 3872.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
[3872.16 --> 3882.16]  Thou King of heaven, my victory won.
[3882.16 --> 3891.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou King of heaven.
[3891.16 --> 3895.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou King of heaven.
[3895.16 --> 3904.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou King of heaven.
[3904.16 --> 3908.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou King of heaven.
[3908.16 --> 3919.82]  M
[3921.16 --> 3923.16]  Panther Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou King of heaven.
[3923.16 --> 3926.16]  Thou King of heaven, my treasure Thou come faith in my зачем and see.
[3926.16 --> 3928.38]  Thou King of heaven, my noble head
