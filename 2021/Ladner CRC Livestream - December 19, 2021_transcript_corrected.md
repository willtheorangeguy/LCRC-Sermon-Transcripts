[586.00 → 594.00] For with blessing in his hand.
[594.00 → 602.00] Christ our Lord to earth descended.
[602.00 → 612.00] Came a homage to command.
[612.00 → 614.00] Good morning.
[614.00 → 616.00] Good morning.
[616.00 → 618.00] Well that was very beautiful.
[618.00 → 620.00] I'm Jason.
[620.00 → 622.00] I'm the lead pastor here.
[622.00 → 624.00] And again welcome to Latin or Christian Reformed Church this morning.
[624.00 → 626.00] It's nice to be with you this morning.
[626.00 → 628.00] And we're here to worship the Lord together.
[628.00 → 632.00] I have just a few announcements to share with you before we begin our time of worship.
[632.00 → 636.00] First is that our designated offering for this Sunday is for our Deacon Help Fund.
[636.00 → 650.00] This is used to assist those within our church family who struggle financially.
[650.00 → 652.00] And we are still not collecting the offering during the worship service.
[652.00 → 662.00] But there are some boxes that you'll see on the walls by the sanctuary doors.
[662.00 → 666.00] And you can put your offering in those boxes.
[666.00 → 670.00] You can also give online on our church website.
[670.00 → 676.00] After the worship service today there will be hospital singing at Mountain View Manor.
[676.00 → 680.00] Which is the Delta Hospital's extended care unit.
[680.00 → 685.00] And if you would like to join, and I hope that many of us will.
[685.00 → 690.00] That is today at 2.30, and you can meet right at Delta View.
[690.00 → 694.00] So also this is the Sunday before Christmas.
[694.00 → 701.00] So upcoming on Friday there is our Christmas Eve worship service.
[701.00 → 703.00] It starts at 6.30.
[703.00 → 709.00] So we will, I just want to warmly welcome you all to come to invite friends and family.
[709.00 → 711.00] We will be singing Christmas hymns.
[711.00 → 717.00] We will be hearing the story of Christmas told through scripture reading and through some narration.
[717.00 → 724.00] And we also have a couple invitation cards that you can pick up on the foyer table right outside.
[724.00 → 729.00] Lastly we also have a Christmas Day service that begins at 10.30 in the morning.
[729.00 → 738.00] It will be a family friendly shorter service of singing and just taking that Christmas Day to bring our hearts before God
[738.00 → 741.00] and to celebrate the birth of Christ.
[741.00 → 744.00] So those are the announcements for this morning.
[744.00 → 748.00] Let's prepare our hearts now to come before the Lord in worship.
[748.00 → 752.00] Our calling our call to worship this morning is based on Psalm 126.
[752.00 → 759.00] And where it's bolded and there's the double arrow, I'll invite you to say it out loud responsibly.
[759.00 → 764.00] The Lord has done great things for us.
[764.00 → 767.00] And we are filled with joy.
[767.00 → 772.00] Our God has turned our weeping into singing.
[772.00 → 775.00] Our tears into songs of joy.
[775.00 → 782.00] O Christ of God, come anew in our hearts this day.
[782.00 → 785.00] And remain in us forever.
[785.00 → 787.00] Would you please join me in prayer.
[787.00 → 792.00] Covenant God of glory and of grace.
[792.00 → 799.00] You are worthy at all times to receive adoration and praise and blessing from all people.
[799.00 → 806.00] You heard your people's earnest cry for a saviour long ago.
[806.00 → 811.00] And Father, we thank you for sending your son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[811.00 → 815.00] We now hold on to your promise that Christ will come again.
[815.00 → 820.00] That death and suffering will end, and every tear will be wiped away.
[820.00 → 822.00] Come Lord Jesus, come.
[822.00 → 829.00] As you fulfilled Israel's hopes long ago, so we long for you to return.
[829.00 → 834.00] And while we wait, Lord, send your spirit so that we might grow in grace
[834.00 → 837.00] and be more and more transformed by your glory.
[837.00 → 839.00] We pray in Jesus' name.
[839.00 → 840.00] Amen.
[840.00 → 843.00] I invite you to stand now.
[843.00 → 845.00] And God greets us with these words.
[845.00 → 849.00] And these words come from Mary's song, the Magnificat in Luke.
[849.00 → 851.00] This is what Mary says.
[851.00 → 854.00] The mighty one has done great things for me.
[854.00 → 856.00] Holy is his name.
[856.00 → 862.00] So as the Lord has greeted us, would you turn, and would you greet those around you?
[862.00 → 867.00] Thank you.
[867.00 → 868.00] Thank you.
[868.00 → 870.00] Good morning, Jack.
[870.00 → 872.00] Good morning, Jack.
[872.00 → 873.00] Good morning, Jack.
[873.00 → 874.00] Good morning, Jack.
[874.00 → 887.00] Good morning, Jack.
[887.00 → 888.00] We'll be with you.
[888.00 → 891.54] The 물론 is the Divine of Genesis 9.
[891.54 → 897.00] We will be with you.
[897.00 → 905.76] Father's love begotten, e'er the world began to be.
[905.76 → 915.76] He is Alpha and Omega, He is the Source, the Ending He.
[915.76 → 934.24] Of the things that are and have been, and that future years shall see, evermore and evermore.
[934.24 → 946.56] Let the heights of heaven adore Him, angels host His praises sing.
[946.56 → 957.84] Hearts of millions bow before Him, and extol our God and King.
[957.84 → 976.84] Let no tongue on earth be silent, every voice in concert ring, evermore and evermore.
[976.84 → 988.84] Christ to you with God the Father, and the Spirit there shall be.
[988.84 → 999.84] Him and chant and high Thanksgiving, and the shout of jubilee.
[999.84 → 1018.84] Honour, glory, and dominion, and eternal victory, evermore and evermore.
[1018.84 → 1025.84] Father's love, I am.
[1025.84 → 1027.84] Amen.
[1027.84 → 1031.84] Amen.
[1031.84 → 1036.84] Amen.
[1036.84 → 1038.84] Amen.
[1038.84 → 1040.84] Amen.
[1040.84 → 1041.84] Amen.
[1041.84 → 1044.84] Amen.
[1044.84 → 1045.84] Amen.
[1045.84 → 1047.84] Amen.
[1047.84 → 1058.34] Amen.
[1058.84 → 1065.34] Every year we light candles as we prepare for the coming of Christ.
[1065.34 → 1069.44] More and more candles, more and more light, as we watch and wait for Jesus, the light of
[1069.44 → 1073.08] the world.
[1073.08 → 1076.66] God, come on, come to our hearts.
[1077.32 → 1082.88] Reveal your hope, your peace, your joy, your love in us.
[1083.54 → 1086.70] For you alone, bring life out of death.
[1087.74 → 1091.00] Receive God's promise of love from Psalm 36.
[1091.50 → 1094.76] Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens.
[1095.46 → 1099.62] Your faithfulness to the clouds, your righteousness is like mighty mountains.
[1099.62 → 1102.98] Your judgments are like the great deep.
[1103.36 → 1105.94] You save humans and animals alike, O Lord.
[1129.62 → 1130.62] Amen.
[1130.62 → 1131.62] Amen.
[1131.62 → 1132.62] Amen.
[1132.62 → 1162.60] Thank you.
[1162.62 → 1192.60] Thank you.
[1192.62 → 1202.62] From our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
[1202.62 → 1212.54] Israel, strength and consolation, above all the earth thou art.
[1212.54 → 1222.68] Dear desire of every nation, joy of every longing heart.
[1222.68 → 1232.40] O thy people to deliver, born a child and yet a king.
[1232.90 → 1242.86] Born to be in us forever, now thy precious kingdom reign.
[1242.86 → 1253.36] By thy own eternal spirit, rule in all our hearts alone.
[1253.88 → 1263.34] By thine all salvation merit, lead us to thy glorious soul.
[1263.34 → 1273.34] O thy people to deliver, born a child and yet a king.
[1273.34 → 1273.36] Thank you.
[1273.36 → 1283.58] So at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1283.58 → 1288.74] I know that they will be rehearsing their song for Christmas Eve that they'll be singing.
[1289.22 → 1291.60] So we will send the kids off now.
[1291.60 → 1302.16] And we have the great joy and privilege today to celebrate two baptisms of Stacy Hu and Jenny Huang.
[1302.64 → 1305.42] But first, we will hear their testimonies.
[1305.88 → 1308.38] And we've pre-recorded the testimonies.
[1308.44 → 1310.46] We're going to show the videos for two reasons.
[1310.60 → 1312.82] One, so they don't feel too nervous up here.
[1312.82 → 1317.76] Secondly, though, so that we can have the English translation for you to read.
[1318.10 → 1319.82] Okay, so we'll watch those videos now.
[1319.82 → 1324.82] 大家好, 我是Tracy。
[1324.82 → 1332.82] 我是在1998年和先生一起从中国的北京移民来到加拿大。
[1332.82 → 1335.82] 当时我们就选择了留在温哥华。
[1335.82 → 1339.82] 想想时间真的过得好快。
[1339.82 → 1343.82] 我们现在已经是20多年的老移民了。
[1343.82 → 1351.82] 想想这一路走来呢, 我们真的也经历了很多酸甜苦吧。
[1351.82 → 1357.82] 我们是在2011年从Richmond搬来Lander。
[1357.82 → 1361.82] 现在呢, 我们家有四口人。
[1361.82 → 1365.82] 大孩子21岁,小女儿11岁。
[1365.82 → 1368.82] 另外呢, 还有两只狗狗。
[1368.82 → 1372.82] 也应该算是一个幸福的家庭。
[1372.82 → 1378.82] 至于我是怎么开始接触圣经。
[1378.82 → 1380.82] 怎么开始来教会的呢?
[1380.82 → 1384.82] 记得刚刚移民来到温哥华的时候。
[1384.82 → 1390.82] 有一次在Skytrain上遇到了一对老夫妇。
[1390.82 → 1392.82] 她们就坐在我身边。
[1392.82 → 1396.82] 后来呢, 就试着向我传福音。
[1396.82 → 1400.82] 记得当时呢, 我还没有工作。
[1400.82 → 1402.82] 处在一种什么样的状况。
[1402.82 → 1404.82] 其实是那会儿蛮焦虑的。
[1404.82 → 1406.82] 因为刚刚来到温哥华呢,
[1406.82 → 1408.82] 没有工作。
[1408.82 → 1410.82] 一切都不稳定。
[1410.82 → 1412.82] 然后呢, 又是一个全新的环境。
[1412.82 → 1414.82] 语言又不通。
[1414.82 → 1416.82] 后来就在这对老夫妇的帮助下呢,
[1416.82 → 1418.82] 去过几次教会。
[1418.82 → 1420.82] 后来呢, 因为工作呀,学习和生活。
[1420.82 → 1422.82] 以及一些家庭的原因吧。
[1422.82 → 1424.82] 去过几次以后呢, 就没有坚持下来。
[1424.82 → 1426.82] 后来呢, 因为工作呀,学习和生活。
[1426.82 → 1428.82] 以及一些家庭的原因吧。
[1428.82 → 1432.82] 去过几次以后呢, 就没有坚持下来。
[1432.82 → 1438.82] 大约在三年前呢, 我们认识了Nancy跟Steven夫妇。
[1438.82 → 1442.82] 我感觉他们就是上帝送给我的一份礼物吧。
[1442.82 → 1446.82] 因为从那时候起, 我觉得我才是真正的开始去。
[1446.82 → 1448.82] 试着去接触上帝。
[1448.82 → 1450.82] 去过几次以后呢, 就没有坚持下来。
[1450.82 → 1452.82] 因为从那时候起, 我觉得我才是真正的开始去。
[1452.82 → 1454.82] 试着去接触上帝。
[1454.82 → 1458.82] 去试着去了解主。
[1458.82 → 1464.82] 感觉, 就是才算是真正的有一个机会。
[1464.82 → 1467.82] 去能和其他的兄弟姐妹们坐在一起。
[1467.82 → 1470.82] 去认真的去读圣经。
[1470.82 → 1472.82] 去学习神的话语。
[1472.82 → 1476.82] 然后呢, 就是在这个过程中呢,
[1476.82 → 1479.82] 我觉得让我自己呢, 也慢慢的有一点提升。
[1479.82 → 1482.82] 因为在生活中呢,
[1482.82 → 1484.82] 往往会遇到很多焦虑啊。
[1484.82 → 1486.82] 很多不如意。
[1486.82 → 1488.82] 很多事情吧。
[1488.82 → 1490.82] 让自己很迷茫。
[1490.82 → 1492.82] 很徘徊。
[1492.82 → 1495.82] 然后在这个时候呢, 我就试着把自己交托给主。
[1495.82 → 1497.82] 一切听主的安排。
[1497.82 → 1500.82] 嗯, 就是感觉自己呢,
[1500.82 → 1504.82] 真的能在这个时候能得到一种释放吧。
[1504.82 → 1508.82] 一种解脱, 一种得到一种自信。
[1508.82 → 1510.82] 嗯, 也就是在这个时候呢,
[1510.82 → 1512.82] 我慢慢思考。
[1512.82 → 1514.82] 嗯, 感觉就是说,
[1514.82 → 1516.82] 我现在所有的这一切呢,
[1516.82 → 1519.82] 都是神来安排的。
[1519.82 → 1522.82] 嗯, 对我而言呢,
[1522.82 → 1525.82] 基督教的精神, 我觉得就是爱和要有细心。
[1525.82 → 1533.82] 嗯, 我也从神以及教会的其他兄弟姐妹那里呢,
[1533.82 → 1535.82] 得到了很多的爱。
[1535.82 → 1539.82] 嗯, 我也感受到了圣经中所说的福悲满意。
[1539.82 → 1545.82] 所以我现在决定要成为一名基督徒,
[1545.82 → 1549.82] 嗯, 受洗,来感谢神对我的爱吧。
[1549.82 → 1551.82] 嗯, 最后呢,我想引用圣经中,
[1551.82 → 1555.82] 哥林多前书十三章四节八, 四至八节。
[1555.82 → 1557.82] 嗯, 爱是恒久忍耐,
[1557.82 → 1559.82] 嗯, 又有恩慈,
[1559.82 → 1561.82] 爱是不嫉妒,
[1561.82 → 1563.82] 爱是不自夸,
[1563.82 → 1565.82] 爱是不自夸,
[1565.82 → 1567.82] 爱是不自夸,
[1567.82 → 1569.82] 不张狂,
[1569.82 → 1571.82] 嗯, 不做羞辱的事,
[1571.82 → 1573.82] 不求自己的益处,
[1573.82 → 1575.82] 嗯, 不轻易发怒,
[1575.82 → 1577.82] 不计算人的恶,
[1577.82 → 1579.82] 不喜欢不义,
[1579.82 → 1581.82] 只喜欢真理,
[1581.82 → 1583.82] 凡事包容,
[1583.82 → 1585.82] 凡事相信,
[1585.82 → 1587.82] 凡事盼望,
[1587.82 → 1589.82] 凡事忍耐,
[1589.82 → 1591.82] 爱是永不止息的。
[1591.82 → 1593.82] 阿们, 谢谢。
[1597.82 → 1599.82], 凡事监督,
[1599.82 → 1601.82] 凡事监督,
[1601.82 → 1603.82] 凡事监督,
[1603.82 → 1633.80] Thank you.
[1633.82 → 1637.82] I see it up there coming up, but it's not playing.
[1637.94 → 1640.14] Maybe it didn't load, so I apologize for that.
[1643.62 → 1646.62] But maybe I can invite Jenny and Tracy to come on up.
[1649.34 → 1660.98] So again, this is, well, you didn't meet Jenny yet, so this is Jenny Huang, and this is Tracy in the pink, who you also...
[1660.98 → 1661.36] Video.
[1661.84 → 1662.48] Oh, here we are.
[1662.48 → 1674.40] And so again, it's just, it's our great delight, a great blessing to baptize you today, to receive you into the fellowship of the church.
[1674.84 → 1682.04] So Tracy and Jenny have both completed a series of baptism classes exploring the basics of the Christian faith.
[1682.04 → 1692.56] They've also met with our pastoral team, where they shared with us how they met the Lord Jesus and expressed their desire to be baptized.
[1692.56 → 1704.88] And we baptize people because Jesus Christ gave us this sign and this seal of what it means to be included into the people of God.
[1704.88 → 1707.70] This is what our Lord Jesus said before he ascended into heaven.
[1708.24 → 1708.50] He said,
[1708.50 → 1732.80] So brothers and sisters, just a brief instruction and reminder.
[1732.80 → 1736.42] Here, I do realize that I'm not speaking in Mandarin.
[1737.10 → 1741.58] Pastor Nancy will also share what I'm saying with Tracy and Jenny.
[1742.14 → 1743.34] And they can understand a lot.
[1743.34 → 1749.20] But first, baptism is a sign and seal of God's promises to his covenant people.
[1749.98 → 1754.78] In baptism, God promises by his grace alone to forgive us of our sins,
[1755.20 → 1758.32] to adopt us into the body of Christ the church,
[1759.04 → 1762.42] to send the Holy Spirit into our hearts to renew us,
[1763.14 → 1766.92] and that one day he would grant us his resurrection life.
[1766.92 → 1771.70] And this promise is made visible by the waters of baptism.
[1772.84 → 1778.36] And through baptism, Christ calls us to a new obedience, a whole new kind of life,
[1778.76 → 1781.34] where we love and trust God completely,
[1782.02 → 1786.24] where we forsake the evil of the world, and we live a new and holy life.
[1787.48 → 1789.08] Yet still we fall into sin.
[1789.08 → 1793.16] But even so, we must not despair of God's mercy,
[1793.70 → 1799.88] because we know in our baptism that we belong to the Lord forever.
[1800.86 → 1808.92] So now I will ask Jenny and Tracy to make their vows before God and before us,
[1809.40 → 1810.92] his body here at Lanner CRC.
[1811.94 → 1812.70] Okay, so first,
[1812.70 → 1816.56] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,
[1817.12 → 1819.12] sent to redeem the world?
[1819.74 → 1820.58] Yes, I do.
[1821.82 → 1825.92] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1826.56 → 1830.42] And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1830.90 → 1831.60] Yes, I do.
[1832.00 → 1835.32] Do you promise to do all you can with the help of the Holy Spirit,
[1835.86 → 1838.08] to strengthen your love and commitment to Christ,
[1838.08 → 1840.34] by sharing faithfully in the life of this church?
[1841.52 → 1842.38] Yes, I do.
[1842.70 → 1842.92] Okay.
[1845.28 → 1846.44] And congregation,
[1846.92 → 1849.88] I have a vow to ask you as well.
[1850.52 → 1851.84] Do you, the people of the Lord,
[1851.94 → 1853.84] promise to receive Tracy and Jenny
[1853.84 → 1855.34] into your fellowship
[1855.34 → 1857.60] as members of the body of Christ?
[1857.98 → 1860.78] And do you promise to encourage them in the Christian faith
[1860.78 → 1864.02] and help them in doing the work of the Lord?
[1865.02 → 1865.86] We do.
[1866.34 → 1868.20] Thank you.
[1869.50 → 1870.88] So let's pray together.
[1871.52 → 1872.30] I'm going to ski day GAO.
[1873.38 → 1874.62] We thank you, Father,
[1874.74 → 1877.00] that by his death and resurrection,
[1877.22 → 1877.96] Jesus Christ,
[1878.38 → 1879.90] who is the living water,
[1880.68 → 1881.60] forgives us,
[1882.22 → 1883.64] frees us from sin and death,
[1883.84 → 1886.24] and opens the way to life everlasting.
[1886.96 → 1888.26] We thank you, O God,
[1888.32 → 1890.18] for this gift of baptism,
[1890.18 → 1892.22] that in this water,
[1892.22 → 1892.24] that in this water,
[1892.24 → 1897.00] you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death,
[1897.00 → 1902.14] and we are raised to share in Christ's resurrection from the dead,
[1902.14 → 1907.06] and that even now we are being renewed daily by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1907.06 → 1908.22] So, Father,
[1908.30 → 1913.28] we do ask that you would send your Holy Spirit upon Tracy and Jenny,
[1913.88 → 1920.50] that this water that is a symbol of your eternal life would well up within their hearts.
[1920.50 → 1927.80] wash away their sins and renew them in the grace that you have for us.
[1928.36 → 1929.68] We pray in Jesus' name,
[1930.00 → 1931.50] and to the glory of God our Father.
[1931.92 → 1932.26] Amen.
[1932.26 → 1932.34] Amen.
[1934.44 → 1938.46] So, I better mask up here.
[1941.60 → 1942.12] Okay.
[1944.50 → 1945.60] So, Tracy,
[1946.12 → 1948.64] we'll go first.
[1949.24 → 1949.92] There you go.
[1950.18 → 1951.00] So, you can kneel there.
[1962.26 → 1962.70] So, Tracy,
[1963.74 → 1966.64] Jesus chose you before the foundation of the world.
[1967.62 → 1969.44] He came into this world for you.
[1969.86 → 1971.22] He lived for you.
[1971.30 → 1972.66] He died for you on the cross.
[1973.02 → 1974.84] He rose from the dead for you,
[1974.84 → 1977.26] and will one day come again for you,
[1977.74 → 1980.18] to bring to you this everlasting kingdom.
[1981.84 → 1982.36] Tracy,
[1983.34 → 1986.06] I thank you in the name of the Lord,
[1986.60 → 1987.50] and of the Son,
[1988.28 → 1989.14] and of the Holy Spirit.
[1990.04 → 1990.36] Amen.
[1992.26 → 1999.38] Here you go.
[2000.24 → 2000.60] Okay.
[2001.80 → 2002.12] Jenny?
[2003.12 → 2003.96] There you go.
[2009.14 → 2010.42] Jenny, in the same way,
[2010.54 → 2013.68] Jesus chose you from the foundation of the world.
[2014.56 → 2015.28] He loved you,
[2015.32 → 2016.12] and because he loved you,
[2016.16 → 2017.36] he came into this world.
[2017.62 → 2019.22] He lived a perfect and holy life.
[2019.78 → 2021.08] He died on the cross for you.
[2021.08 → 2022.44] He rose again for you,
[2022.80 → 2024.52] and one day he will come again,
[2024.68 → 2027.04] to bring you into his eternal kingdom.
[2031.82 → 2033.20] Jenny, I baptize you,
[2033.36 → 2034.16] in the name of the Father,
[2034.68 → 2035.36] and of the Son,
[2036.00 → 2036.82] and of the Holy Spirit.
[2037.60 → 2037.94] Amen.
[2037.94 → 2038.04] Amen.
[2038.04 → 2052.38] So now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2052.46 → 2054.20] the only king and the head of the church,
[2054.84 → 2057.42] Tracy and Jenny are now received into the fellowship
[2057.42 → 2059.44] of the Holy Catholic Church,
[2060.16 → 2063.60] engaged to confess Christ and be God's faithful servants
[2063.60 → 2066.92] until life's end.
[2068.66 → 2069.80] Let's praise God together.
[2077.88 → 2079.04] And let's pray again.
[2079.04 → 2081.04] Father, we give you great thanks
[2081.04 → 2085.40] for the new life that you give to people.
[2086.08 → 2086.96] Lord, we thank you
[2086.96 → 2089.76] that not only can we read your word
[2089.76 → 2092.60] and we see the way you have been active in the world,
[2092.70 → 2093.66] but even today,
[2094.36 → 2097.16] we see people from all the nations
[2097.16 → 2100.28] coming to know the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2100.78 → 2104.10] We see lives being changed by the Holy Spirit
[2104.10 → 2105.28] and by your grace.
[2105.92 → 2106.66] Lord, thank you
[2106.66 → 2108.38] for the new life
[2108.38 → 2109.64] that you have given Tracy and Jenny
[2109.64 → 2111.00], and thank you for bringing them
[2111.00 → 2113.18] into our church,
[2113.54 → 2114.64] that they could be
[2114.64 → 2116.68] our sisters in Christ,
[2117.38 → 2118.58] that we could live out
[2118.58 → 2120.62] the Christian faith together with them.
[2121.56 → 2122.54] Father, we thank you
[2122.54 → 2123.98] and praise you in Jesus' name.
[2124.60 → 2124.94] Amen.
[2128.14 → 2129.56] And we have a gift
[2129.56 → 2132.38] for them.
[2134.10 → 2135.18] There you go.
[2137.22 → 2140.32] So these are bilingual Chinese English Bibles.
[2146.02 → 2146.58] Okay.
[2147.54 → 2148.28] Thank you.
[2151.06 → 2152.18] Here's your certificate.
[2153.06 → 2153.20] Okay.
[2154.98 → 2155.76] There we go.
[2156.02 → 2156.24] Okay.
[2158.28 → 2158.92] Go ahead.
[2158.92 → 2160.42] Thank you.
[2160.42 → 2160.92] Thank you.
[2164.10 → 2171.40] And we will sing a song
[2171.40 → 2174.00] to celebrate these baptisms.
[2174.00 → 2175.48] We'll sing in Christ alone.
[2175.48 → 2175.54] Thank you.
[2175.54 → 2175.58] Thank you.
[2175.58 → 2175.64] Thank you.
[2194.10 → 2195.48] In Christ alone
[2195.48 → 2198.88] My hope is found
[2198.88 → 2200.40] He is my light,
[2200.48 → 2201.40] My strength,
[2202.08 → 2203.54] My song
[2203.54 → 2205.48] His cornerstone
[2205.48 → 2208.80] His solid ground
[2208.80 → 2210.34] Firm through the fears
[2210.34 → 2212.72] of drought and storm
[2212.86 → 2213.92] that I love
[2214.76 → 2216.24] And.
[2216.24 → 2223.18] depths of peace, when fears are stilled, when strivings cease.
[2223.18 → 2233.58] I come, the term, I all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[2235.28 → 2244.98] In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless babe,
[2244.98 → 2254.78] this gift of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones He came to save.
[2255.20 → 2263.90] Till on the cross, as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[2263.90 → 2275.62] For every sin on Him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[2277.52 → 2287.48] There in the ground His body lay, light of the world by darkness slain.
[2287.48 → 2297.54] Then bursting forth in glorious day, up from the grave He rose again.
[2297.90 → 2307.64] And as He stands in victory, sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[2307.64 → 2318.94] For I am His, and He is mine, bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[2320.78 → 2329.64] No guilt in life, no fear in death, this is the power of Christ in me.
[2329.64 → 2339.86] From life's first cry, to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny.
[2341.14 → 2351.12] No power of hell, no human plan, can ever pluck me from His hand.
[2351.12 → 2361.26] Till He returns, or calls me home, here in the power of Christ ascend.
[2361.26 → 2391.24] No power of hell, no human plan, can ever pluck me from His hand.
[2391.24 → 2396.52] With a time of confession, and this prayer of confession.
[2398.34 → 2405.98] So let us say these words, I will begin, and then the next slide I'll have you read aloud with me.
[2406.60 → 2407.56] Let's pray together.
[2409.20 → 2413.70] God of salvation, in Christ you have done great things.
[2414.26 → 2415.78] Our hearts are filled with joy.
[2415.78 → 2419.78] By your power you lifted us out of the wasteland of sin,
[2420.32 → 2423.04] and brought us with joy and laughter into your kingdom.
[2423.86 → 2426.32] Salvation is your gift to us.
[2427.70 → 2434.26] But we confess that often we try to replace your gift with our own efforts.
[2434.98 → 2438.04] We try to complete what is already perfect.
[2438.04 → 2441.54] We try to add to what is already full.
[2441.98 → 2445.62] We try to earn what we already have.
[2446.98 → 2449.04] Forgive us for our foolishness.
[2449.38 → 2450.92] Help us to live in your grace.
[2451.42 → 2452.44] For Jesus' sake alone.
[2453.40 → 2453.82] Amen.
[2453.82 → 2460.26] Now hear these words of assurance from Paul's letter to the Galatians.
[2460.98 → 2461.32] He says,
[2461.46 → 2467.72] But when the set time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
[2468.28 → 2474.32] to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to son ship.
[2474.32 → 2478.96] That is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ for us.
[2480.70 → 2482.04] So friends, let's sing,
[2483.14 → 2484.10] Oh the deep, deep,
[2484.22 → 2484.92] Oh, not that one.
[2485.04 → 2485.28] Yes.
[2485.74 → 2486.80] Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[2494.80 → 2495.24] Let's stand.
[2495.48 → 2496.14] One more time.
[2496.48 → 2497.44] I know it's a lot of up and down.
[2497.96 → 2498.50] Let's stand.
[2498.56 → 2499.48] It's easier to sing that way.
[2499.48 → 2499.54] Okay.
[2504.32 → 2520.08] Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[2520.08 → 2526.86] Let's come measure, boundless free.
[2527.22 → 2533.48] Rolling as a mighty ocean.
[2533.48 → 2540.36] In His fullness, over me.
[2540.36 → 2553.06] Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thine.
[2553.06 → 2567.30] Leading onward, leading homeward, to Thy glorious rest above.
[2567.30 → 2575.18] Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[2575.18 → 2582.68] Spread His praise from shore to shore.
[2582.68 → 2589.98] How He loves us, ever loves us.
[2589.98 → 2596.96] Change us never, never more.
[2596.96 → 2603.84] How He watches for His loved ones.
[2603.84 → 2611.38] Died to call them on His own.
[2611.38 → 2618.36] How for them, He's interceding,
[2618.84 → 2625.78] Watching on them from the throne.
[2625.78 → 2632.66] O love, deep, deep love of Jesus.
[2632.66 → 2636.66] Love of every love of Jesus.
[2636.66 → 2640.56] Love of every love of best.
[2640.56 → 2644.76] In Jesus the Lord.
[2644.76 → 2647.44] Look above you from my heart.
[2647.44 → 2651.48] This Washington напис, O earth ISEN.
[2651.48 → 2652.78] The personnel's honour of all you are.
[2652.78 → 2653.84] Perfect love of God.
[2653.84 → 2661.84] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[2662.32 → 2668.90] Is a help of hands to me,
[2669.36 → 2675.90] And it lifts me up to glory,
[2675.90 → 2683.36] For it lifts me up to thee.
[2683.84 → 2705.88] So good morning again.
[2705.88 → 2706.98] Good morning.
[2706.98 → 2714.08] And this morning we continue our sermon series for this season of Advent.
[2714.78 → 2720.54] And this year, instead of considering the first Advent, the first coming of Christ,
[2720.70 → 2724.62] to Mary born in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago,
[2724.62 → 2732.84] what we are doing is considering the second Advent, the second coming of Christ one day in the future.
[2733.22 → 2736.20] And Christ has promised that he will come again.
[2737.22 → 2741.90] You know, Jesus, when he was on earth, he told his followers that he would return.
[2742.52 → 2745.86] That he would return to judge all that's evil in the world.
[2746.16 → 2748.76] That he would return to renew all things.
[2749.40 → 2755.28] And to bring his everlasting kingdom of justice and joy.
[2755.28 → 2758.64] But that teaching, you know, we have to be honest.
[2758.74 → 2761.92] That teaching was a hundred generations ago.
[2762.42 → 2766.32] What are we to make of that expectation today?
[2767.86 → 2773.22] Well, we are a Christian church that is descended from that of the apostles.
[2774.04 → 2775.12] And there is nothing,
[2775.12 → 2780.04] there is nothing preventing Jesus from returning in our lifetime.
[2780.04 → 2785.58] Right? We could very well be the last generation before the great consummation.
[2786.40 → 2792.80] And in fact, the apostle Paul tells us to live in expectation and in hope of his appearing.
[2793.72 → 2794.80] Right? Eager for it.
[2795.04 → 2796.10] Not dreading it.
[2796.94 → 2798.32] Watching for it.
[2799.02 → 2800.00] Not growing weary.
[2801.38 → 2808.06] And Paul told us that there would be some markers to tell us that the last day has come.
[2808.28 → 2810.00] So that's what we're going to look at today.
[2811.04 → 2814.38] Some of the markers, some of the signs of the last times.
[2815.40 → 2818.22] And so, I just realized we didn't read our scripture.
[2818.92 → 2821.18] So could I invite, who is reading today?
[2821.62 → 2822.00] Oh, Martin.
[2822.64 → 2824.24] Martin, would you come and read for us?
[2824.36 → 2826.46] And then we'll pray, and then we'll dive into the passage.
[2840.04 → 2849.38] I'll be reading from 2 Thessalonians 2, 1 through 8.
[2849.38 → 2850.38] 1 Thessalonians 3, 1 through 8.
[2850.38 → 2851.38] 1 through 8.
[2851.38 → 2852.38] 1 through 8.
[2852.38 → 2853.38] 1 through 8.
[2853.38 → 2854.38] 1 through 8.
[2854.38 → 2855.38] 1 through 8.
[2855.38 → 2856.38] 1 through 8.
[2856.38 → 2857.38] 1 through 8.
[2857.38 → 2858.38] 1 through 9.
[2858.38 → 2859.38] 2 through 9.
[2859.38 → 2860.38] 1 through 9.
[2860.38 → 2861.38] 2 through 9.
[2861.38 → 2862.38] 1 through 9.
[2862.38 → 2863.38] 1 through 9.
[2863.38 → 2864.38] 1 through 9.
[2864.38 → 2865.38] 2 through 10.
[2865.38 → 2866.38] 2 through 9.
[2866.38 → 2867.38] 1 through 9.
[2867.38 → 2868.38] 2 through 9.
[2868.38 → 2869.38] 3 through 9.
[2869.38 → 2876.50] come. Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion
[2876.50 → 2884.34] occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose
[2884.34 → 2891.52] and he will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped, so that he sets
[2891.52 → 2899.32] himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself as God. Don't you remember that when I was with you,
[2899.38 → 2906.06] I used to tell you these things, and now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed
[2906.06 → 2912.80] at the proper time? For the secret powers of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who
[2912.80 → 2921.90] now holds it back will continue to do so until he is taken away. Then the lawless one will be revealed,
[2922.16 → 2927.78] whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendour of his
[2927.78 → 2930.14] coming. This is the word of the Lord.
[2930.82 → 2931.92] Thanks be to God.
[2941.12 → 2949.28] All right, would you pray with me now? Lord Jesus, Emmanuel, God with us, as we wait for your return,
[2949.80 → 2954.80] Lord, would you help us see your glory and your love that is revealed to us in your word?
[2954.80 → 2960.66] Lord, as we open up your word, would your Holy Spirit come, comfort our hearts, and also would
[2960.66 → 2969.50] you teach us, Lord? We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. So this is an interesting passage. I never thought
[2969.50 → 2976.46] I would necessarily preach on this, but here we are in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, and it's talking
[2976.46 → 2983.10] about signs of the end, including the coming of the Antichrist. And as we think about this,
[2983.10 → 2991.00] let's go back a bit in history. If you were alive in the 5th century, and if you were part of the Roman
[2991.00 → 3001.86] Empire, you knew who to be afraid of. There was a name that could strike terror into your heart,
[3002.62 → 3011.86] and that name was Attila the Hun. So here's an image I found on Google. This is by a French romantic
[3011.86 → 3019.56] painter of the 18th century. So now Attila the Hun had a nickname. He called himself in Latin
[3019.56 → 3027.46] Flagellum DEI, the scourge of God. One Roman historian of the time wrote,
[3027.86 → 3035.66] he was a man born into the world to shake the nations, the scourge of all lands who in some way
[3035.66 → 3045.94] terrified all mankind. For 30 or 40 years in the 5th century, Attila and his army ravaged the Roman
[3045.94 → 3053.82] Empire. They demanded massive amounts of tribute and gold, and they generally lurked as a nightmare
[3053.82 → 3063.08] in the imagination of Romans everywhere. Artists of the period depict Attila the Hun as something that's
[3063.08 → 3071.48] not quite human. He would be depicted with kind of this goat beard and horns like of a devil that we
[3071.48 → 3078.70] might see in a cartoon. And for Christians of that time in the 5th century, Attila was commonly thought
[3078.70 → 3088.84] to be the Antichrist. Now the Antichrist, what is that? Who is that? It is spoken about both in the
[3088.84 → 3093.68] Old and the New Testaments, and at least biblically when we talk about the Antichrist. We are referring
[3093.68 → 3101.54] to an individual, a person who is going to come near the end of all things, who will embody evil,
[3102.30 → 3109.12] lawlessness, and rebellion against Jesus. I mean the name gives it away, right? Antichrist.
[3109.86 → 3118.74] Anti-meaning opposed to or against Christ. The Antichrist. And if you were a 5th century Christian,
[3118.74 → 3127.00] you were convinced that Attila the Hun was the Antichrist that the Bible was speaking of.
[3127.72 → 3134.56] But then one night in the year 453, at a wedding banquet where Attila himself was getting married
[3134.56 → 3143.82] to yet another wife, he died in his sleep from internal bleeding. The bride was declared not guilty.
[3143.82 → 3151.50] And almost, but you know people suspect. But anyway, almost overnight the Hun empire faded away
[3151.50 → 3158.24] as his son started fighting amongst themselves. And in a few years the whole empire just dissipated.
[3159.26 → 3166.86] So, well, looks like the end has it come. Attila the Hun, maybe he's not the Antichrist. So Christians
[3166.86 → 3174.46] turned their attentions elsewhere. And then throughout history, people have often denounced their adversaries
[3174.46 → 3180.40] as being the Antichrist. And so the early Christians thought that their persecutors,
[3180.98 → 3189.34] like Nero, was the Antichrist. And well, that's understandable. And then Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin
[3189.34 → 3198.56] were also candidates for obvious reasons. Nearly every American president since Washington has made it
[3198.56 → 3202.72] on the Antichrist suspect list. I don't know why people think it's going to be an American president,
[3203.78 → 3208.26] but with politics it's always the opposite guy. He must be the Antichrist.
[3208.26 → 3217.94] And the reformers, like Martin Luther and John Calvin, they called the papacy the Antichrist.
[3218.60 → 3224.64] And the Catholic Church, in turn, accused Martin Luther of being the Antichrist. And so what we find
[3224.64 → 3231.64] throughout history is that it's no good just using that title for whoever you don't like at any
[3231.64 → 3237.08] particular time. I think we can be more informed about whom the Antichrist is,
[3237.08 → 3242.74] because God gives us some explicit instructions for what Christians should expect and how we can
[3242.74 → 3250.70] know that the end is here. Now the reason why is Paul addressing this in his letter to the church
[3250.70 → 3256.26] in Thessalonica, which is in Greece. It was, this is actually one of the earliest letters in the New
[3256.26 → 3261.92] Testament letters. Well, first Thessalonians and then second Thessalonians. And the reason why Paul is
[3261.92 → 3269.20] writing about this topic is that the Thessalonians were concerned. Someone had tried to deceive him,
[3269.64 → 3276.26] them, Paul says in verse 2, saying that the day of the Lord has already come, that they had missed it.
[3276.98 → 3281.72] That's why they were so worried. You know, they're thinking maybe Jesus has come back to Jerusalem.
[3281.86 → 3286.26] We're way off in Thessalonica. It would take us days in a sea voyage to get to Jerusalem.
[3286.26 → 3295.34] We're off here in Greece. Maybe we just missed it. Maybe we're not Christians. So they're confused by
[3295.34 → 3302.24] what they're hearing. They're worried. And Paul writes the second letter to address their concerns.
[3303.34 → 3309.08] Now maybe like the Thessalonians, you have some questions and worries about the second coming.
[3309.08 → 3316.52] Many of us do. There are a lot of things that are unclear. And it's hard to understand what the
[3316.52 → 3321.24] scriptures have to say. But we also know that our Lord Jesus told us to be watchful, to be ready.
[3321.58 → 3330.26] We want to be obedient to him. And so maybe we feel a little bit uncertain. For others of us,
[3330.38 → 3336.96] this passage addresses a concern that you don't have. Maybe you've never even heard of the Antichrist
[3336.96 → 3345.56] before. Maybe you don't think about the end times. And that's okay. But whether this is something
[3345.56 → 3351.10] you're thinking about or not, God in his wisdom and care teaches us some things in this letter that
[3351.10 → 3356.92] he wants us to know about. This isn't a very popular topic in our day. And again, like I said,
[3357.00 → 3361.04] I didn't really imagine I'd be preaching about this. I mean, like next week's Christmas. Why are we
[3361.04 → 3368.50] talking about the Antichrist? But Advent is like that. Advent, one, looks backwards to Christ's first
[3368.50 → 3374.86] coming. And as we look at that, it was very subversive. It was very unexpected. And we also look
[3374.86 → 3381.34] forward to the coming of Christ again in these end times, which are also very apocalyptic, of course,
[3381.44 → 3386.82] and subversive. And so as Christians today, we are looking backwards. We're looking forwards.
[3386.82 → 3393.24] And one of the things that Christians have always needed to think about as we wait for Christ to
[3393.24 → 3398.74] come is what will happen in the last days. And one of the things that God tells us is some of these
[3398.74 → 3403.18] signs that we are to look forward to. So that's why, you know, if you're sitting here like, I thought
[3403.18 → 3406.76] we're going to talk about Jesus in the manger. Why are we talking about the Antichrist? Well, that's why.
[3409.98 → 3416.62] We don't know when Jesus is going to come back. Jesus told us himself, I don't know when I'm going to
[3416.62 → 3424.22] come back. Only the Father knows. That's one thing I really love. If you think about it, that God the
[3424.22 → 3430.90] Father is going to throw a surprise party for Jesus, right? In the coming days, there'll be the
[3430.90 → 3437.28] wedding of the Lamb. His church will be gathered to him, and it's going to be a surprise. And I think
[3437.28 → 3443.10] it's just a picture of God's love for the Son. And one reason that we can even love him more too.
[3443.10 → 3451.80] But Jesus says, I don't know when I'm coming back. But Jesus did tell us to stay awake. He said to be
[3451.80 → 3458.94] aware. He said to be ready. So this morning, I want to look at just two things briefly. There is so much
[3458.94 → 3464.64] going on this passage. I just want to try to draw out two main things. First, I want to talk about just
[3464.64 → 3470.08] what is Paul telling us that we should recognize about the day of his coming? Okay, what should we
[3470.08 → 3474.28] recognize about the day of the Lord's coming? And then secondly, I just want us to consider some
[3474.28 → 3479.30] implications for us today. Why does this matter for us? So that's how we're going to do it. So first,
[3479.40 → 3484.68] let's just look at this passage, and let's draw out a few things that we can know about the second
[3484.68 → 3490.16] coming of our Lord Jesus, the second advent. And there are three brief things that we're going to look
[3490.16 → 3496.94] at today. First is that there will be a rebellion. There will be a rebellion. And we see that in the
[3496.94 → 3502.62] middle of verse three. I wasn't able to get all the scriptures up, which I normally like to do.
[3502.74 → 3507.98] If you want to pull open the Bible, you might have in front of you or open up your app. It would be
[3507.98 → 3513.10] good for you to have the text in front of you. We're in second Thessalonians chapter two. And then
[3513.10 → 3520.56] right in verse three, Paul says this, for that day will come, will not come, I'm sorry, for that day
[3520.56 → 3529.98] will not come until the rebellion occurs. The rebellion comes first. What is the rebellion?
[3530.92 → 3541.32] I don't know. Seriously. Augustine, the great early theologian, he considered this text the most obscure
[3541.32 → 3547.96] thing that Paul ever wrote. So the first thing that we should say about this passage is that there is a lot
[3547.96 → 3553.36] here that is unclear to us. And Augustine says that when it comes to this passage, we should be careful
[3553.36 → 3559.66] to acknowledge our ignorance. So that's what I'm doing right now. What's the rebellion? We don't know
[3559.66 → 3566.50] exactly, to be honest. But with that caveat in mind, there is much that we can understand about it.
[3567.16 → 3573.60] So we do know this. The word for rebellion that Paul uses here is the Greek word apostasy.
[3573.60 → 3583.86] Apostasy. Apostasy is rejecting your beliefs and embracing opposing beliefs. So at some point in
[3583.86 → 3590.16] their lives, a Christian said they were a Christian, they lived like a Christian, but later on,
[3590.88 → 3600.54] they changed their mind. They recanted their beliefs. There are others, scholars, who think that Paul is
[3600.54 → 3605.90] referring here not to apostasy from within the church, but just a general rebellion of a great
[3605.90 → 3611.80] kind of swath or portion of mankind. Okay, so those are the kind of the two main views. It's either
[3611.80 → 3616.06] apostasy of the church, or it's this larger rebellion of the unchristian world. I don't see why it can't be
[3616.06 → 3623.44] both. But the teaching about a large-scale apostasy in the last days is a theme that we find elsewhere
[3623.44 → 3631.68] in the New Testament. Just think about how many of Paul's letters where he tells us to stand firm
[3631.68 → 3638.22] in the faith. This is a huge theme in Paul's writings. Paul wrote to Timothy later in 1 Timothy
[3638.22 → 3645.70] chapter 4. He said, the Spirit clearly says that in later times, some will abandon the faith and follow
[3645.70 → 3652.62] deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Hey, did you hear that? In later times, some will abandon
[3652.62 → 3660.70] the faith. We've seen the seeds of this many times in the church, haven't we? In the Enlightenment, many
[3660.70 → 3665.68] people in Western society left the Christian faith. I mean, we even think about in the Old Testament,
[3665.84 → 3672.74] Elijah complaining to God, Lord, there are, you know, everyone has left you. The Israelites have
[3672.74 → 3680.44] ignored your covenant. They've followed other gods. Only I am left, right? So this isn't a new thing.
[3680.44 → 3688.28] In our day, more and more people are leaving the church and identifying as nuns. I don't know if you've
[3688.28 → 3694.10] heard that term. Meaning that on the surveys that are done, when they say, you know, what's your
[3694.10 → 3700.70] religious affiliation, it used to be that many people would check Christian. Now, more and more people are
[3700.70 → 3709.14] checking no religious affiliation. None. It's the rise of the nuns. So we are certainly seeing a changing
[3709.14 → 3714.76] landscape in the church today. So apostasy is not new, but in the last days, Paul says there will be a
[3714.76 → 3721.00] great rebellion. I read it as a great apostasy, a falling away from the faith. So that's the first
[3721.00 → 3727.20] thing, that there will be a rebellion. Secondly, there is going to be a revealing. That's the second
[3727.20 → 3735.10] way that we can recognize the coming of the Lord. Paul says that the man of lawlessness will be
[3735.10 → 3742.02] revealed. Okay, so now the man of lawlessness, who is he? Now, this is the only place in the whole Bible
[3742.02 → 3750.04] where that phrase is used. It was specific for the Thessalonians. Also, this text, if you notice,
[3750.16 → 3755.96] doesn't use the name Antichrist. So are those two things the same? What's going on there? Well,
[3756.00 → 3760.32] the word Antichrist comes from Paul's, not Paul, John's letters, first, second, third John.
[3760.32 → 3766.46] And he talks about an Antichrist figure who is described in a very similar way to the man of
[3766.46 → 3772.62] lawlessness that is described in this text. Also, there are other parts of the scriptures, Daniel 7,
[3773.06 → 3780.62] Revelation 13, which again use different titles, but clearly refer to the same person.
[3781.98 → 3787.02] So if you add together all the biblical texts where you find writings about this, you'll find
[3787.02 → 3792.98] this kind of basic idea that kind of pulls them all together. That in the future, there's going to
[3792.98 → 3799.92] be an individual who comes who will be a great doer of evil and will be a servant of Satan. He is the
[3799.92 → 3804.94] Antichrist, the man of lawlessness. So I believe most people, scholars believe he's talking about the
[3804.94 → 3813.94] same person. Now, what exactly will he be like? Let's look at how our text describes him. First, it says
[3813.94 → 3821.00] that he is a man of lawlessness. And that means that this person will be opposed in every way to
[3821.00 → 3830.62] the law of God. He will be a rebel par excellence. He will be the heavyweight champion. Furthermore, he will be the
[3830.62 → 3838.42] Stanley Cup winner of flouting God's rules. He's like, I don't know how many of you play video games,
[3838.42 → 3844.40] but in video games, you kind of conquer the first bad guy, and then you advance and conquer the next
[3844.40 → 3851.14] bad guy. And John says, there have been many Antichrists, kind of little Antichrists, but this
[3851.14 → 3858.68] guy is the main bad boss. This is the guy you beat at the end of the video game, the boss bad guy. So he
[3858.68 → 3867.38] is called the man of lawlessness. Second, he will demand worship. Verse four says, he will oppose and will
[3867.38 → 3874.06] exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped so that he sets himself up in God's
[3874.06 → 3881.42] temple, proclaiming himself to be God. Okay, so this Antichrist will not merely be an opposer of God or
[3881.42 → 3890.80] the church. He will demand to be worshipped himself. The Antichrist will seek to dethrone God and to
[3890.80 → 3898.68] enthrone himself on the throne of God. He will commit the ultimate blasphemy of proclaiming himself
[3898.68 → 3907.80] to be God. And then third, we see that the man of lawlessness is being held back. Okay, he's being
[3907.80 → 3911.72] held back. And we see that in verses five and six, if you have your text in front of you.
[3911.72 → 3918.68] This is what it says in verse five. Paul says, don't you remember that when I was with you,
[3918.78 → 3926.10] so that's first Thessalonians, I used to tell you these things. And now you know what is holding him
[3926.10 → 3934.62] back so that he may be revealed at the proper time. Okay, everyone, you know who is holding him back,
[3934.66 → 3939.82] right? So who or what is holding back the man of lawlessness? Does anybody know?
[3939.82 → 3948.74] Somebody, somebody knows. I only saw one hand. So if you don't know, don't feel too bad about it.
[3949.18 → 3957.12] Even St. Augustine says, I frankly confess, I do not know what he means. Apparently, Paul knew
[3957.12 → 3967.02] and he told the Thessalonians, but he didn't write it down. Thanks a lot. And just because of this,
[3967.02 → 3973.82] do you know how many blogs have been written? How deep the rabbit hole is? It's just one of those
[3973.82 → 3980.54] details in this passage that we have to acknowledge our ignorance about. There are seven main suggestions
[3980.54 → 3986.14] that have been proposed. Seven. Number one, just kidding. I'm not going to go through all seven of
[3986.14 → 3990.80] them. We don't have time for that. I'm just going to tell you the one I lean toward.
[3990.80 → 3999.34] Jesus says this in Matthew 24, 14. He says, and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the
[3999.34 → 4006.36] whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. So some scholars say,
[4006.48 → 4011.70] and I think this is a good bet, that maybe what Paul is talking about is that God is holding back
[4011.70 → 4017.64] the Antichrist, holding back the man of lawlessness, restraining him until the gospel is proclaimed to all
[4017.64 → 4025.56] the nations. That's one view. I tend to favour that view, but you don't have to. There are other views,
[4025.80 → 4031.56] and there's some perfect options out there. Quickly, maybe another top two would be civil
[4031.56 → 4035.58] authorities. That's what Paul's talking about, and you can look in Paul's letters. He has a high view
[4035.58 → 4043.40] of the civil authorities as restraining the wicked and lawlessness. That's a favoured view. Also, it could
[4043.40 → 4048.26] just be the church and the Holy Spirit. That, you know, Jesus said to go be salt and light in the
[4048.26 → 4054.42] world, and Christians around the world have established hospitals and schools and sought to
[4054.42 → 4059.44] establish just societies. That the church, as salt in the world, is what is holding back lawlessness.
[4059.98 → 4066.34] So there are a bunch of good views. We just don't know what Paul meant. But what I think is noteworthy
[4066.34 → 4073.36] about his being held back is that it shows the man of lawlessness doesn't have all the power.
[4074.36 → 4082.12] God is sovereign, and events occur at the time he deems appropriate. He is being held back. He is
[4082.12 → 4091.36] powerless. God is holding him back. However, he chooses to accomplish that. So we've seen that there
[4091.36 → 4096.64] is going to be a great rebellion, and that that rebellion is connected to the revealing of the
[4096.64 → 4103.60] man of lawlessness, that this restraint will be broken, that he will appear. And then that brings
[4103.60 → 4111.02] us to our third thing we learn about the coming of the Lord. And we see that in verse 8. Verse 8 says,
[4111.38 → 4118.10] and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his
[4118.10 → 4126.44] mouth, and destroy by the splendour of his coming. That is an awesome verse. I don't know why we didn't
[4126.44 → 4132.84] memorize that in Sunday school. The Lord Jesus will overthrow him with the breath of his mouth at the
[4132.84 → 4139.66] splendour of his coming. That is awesome. This is telling us the restraint will one day be removed,
[4139.92 → 4146.50] then the secret power of lawlessness that Paul talks about here, that is always kind of brewing in the
[4146.50 → 4153.98] world, will become open rebellion under the leadership of the lawless one. And then at that time,
[4154.14 → 4162.62] a mercifully short time, the Lord will then come and will destroy him. And the reference to breath there,
[4163.02 → 4172.60] it's simply an intimation of the enormous power of Jesus. Right? Jesus doesn't need to go and punch him,
[4172.60 → 4178.46] anything like that. There will be no heavyweight wrestling match in the end. Jesus will simply
[4178.46 → 4188.04] breathe on him, and the man of lawlessness will disintegrate. Right? The God who spoke the creation
[4188.04 → 4196.82] and it leapt into being, the God who stills the storms by a word and who raises the dead by just saying,
[4196.82 → 4206.36] come out of the grave, will again speak, and all evil will come apart. Right? So these Thessalonians,
[4206.54 → 4210.66] they're afraid, they're confused, they're alarmed. Maybe they've missed out on Christ's return,
[4210.96 → 4216.04] but Paul says you don't have to be afraid. Everything that is opposed to Jesus will perish,
[4216.50 → 4222.08] and it will perish in a single breath of his mouth. You don't need to be shaken, you don't need to be
[4222.08 → 4227.96] alarmed, you don't need to be deceived because you know it is the end when Jesus returns.
[4229.62 → 4235.50] So first things first, there will be a rebellion, which is connected to the revealing of the man of
[4235.50 → 4240.54] lawlessness who will be killed when Jesus comes again. And all these things, you have to, in your
[4240.54 → 4244.46] imagination, all of these things, hold them together. These are all going to happen at the same time.
[4244.46 → 4250.52] And friends, we can stand firm in that. There are a lot of details we don't get,
[4251.30 → 4254.98] but we can get the big picture. There's a lot we can know.
[4257.20 → 4262.42] So those are some signs of the second advent, the second coming of Christ. Now, how are we to respond?
[4262.54 → 4267.60] What are some implications for us today? I mean, how, what do you do with this text when you go home
[4267.60 → 4273.72] and have your lunch or go on your walk this afternoon? I have three things I want to mention to us.
[4274.46 → 4279.80] The first thing I want you to know is that when we have difficult questions like this in the Bible,
[4280.34 → 4288.00] we just need to balance that with the whole of Scripture. And here's what I mean by that.
[4288.42 → 4294.54] Sometimes we can get so deep in this topic about the end times, about what is going to happen,
[4295.02 → 4300.52] about when it's going to happen, that we end up disobeying other parts of Scripture.
[4300.52 → 4305.90] And what was going on in the Thessalonian church is that that is exactly what was happening.
[4306.72 → 4312.40] Right? If you keep reading in the rest of Paul's letter, some of the Thessalonians are so obsessed by this
[4312.40 → 4316.46] that they stopped working, that they stopped loving their neighbours,
[4316.46 → 4321.26] and they just basically stopped living out the Christian life because they were so concerned about
[4321.26 → 4326.28] what is going to happen next. And Paul is telling them, like, sure, I'm going to address your concern.
[4326.28 → 4331.88] There are some things that you can know about the Antichrist and the second coming,
[4332.36 → 4338.54] but we've got to balance it with other things. Paul tells them, go to work, love your neighbour.
[4340.16 → 4343.80] You know, and we don't know on what day Jesus is going to return.
[4344.48 → 4350.62] But in the meanwhile, what we do know is certain, as the prophet Micah says,
[4350.62 → 4355.84] that God calls us to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.
[4356.54 → 4360.26] That is certain. We can always do those things, and we are called to.
[4361.00 → 4362.32] So we need balance, right?
[4363.08 → 4370.44] And if all of your theology and all of your discussions always end up on end time something or other,
[4371.40 → 4375.44] right? You know, if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right?
[4375.44 → 4378.62] We need more tools in our toolbox. Not everything is a nail.
[4380.14 → 4383.86] And if that's kind of the way you see everything, then maybe you're out of balance.
[4384.90 → 4387.08] So that's the first reminder of this passage.
[4388.06 → 4391.76] The second implication for us today is that we don't have to be afraid.
[4392.64 → 4393.74] Friends, we don't have to be afraid.
[4395.58 → 4397.46] God keeps those who are his.
[4399.06 → 4402.56] In verse 13, we didn't read, but just a couple verses ahead,
[4402.56 → 4404.74] Paul says to the Thessalonians,
[4405.28 → 4406.52] you are loved by God.
[4406.92 → 4408.54] You are chosen by God.
[4409.02 → 4410.72] You are saved by God.
[4411.02 → 4413.38] You are sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[4414.76 → 4417.88] And remember what we read in 1 Peter last week.
[4418.38 → 4421.66] We are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation
[4421.66 → 4424.06] that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[4424.44 → 4426.70] We are shielded by God's power.
[4428.18 → 4429.42] God is keeping you.
[4429.42 → 4434.78] So you don't, you know, so don't just identify as a Christian on those surveys
[4434.78 → 4437.76] and check Christian instead of none.
[4438.84 → 4442.98] Know who you are as a Christian and live like it.
[4443.72 → 4443.88] Right?
[4443.98 → 4445.54] Don't just acknowledge God.
[4445.74 → 4446.94] Live for him in the world.
[4447.36 → 4448.18] Give him everything.
[4448.82 → 4451.42] Walk in his ways and help others do the same.
[4452.72 → 4456.18] The apostasy will come, but God keeps those who are his.
[4457.14 → 4458.14] You don't have to be afraid.
[4458.14 → 4462.00] Finally, what the scriptures are clear about is this,
[4462.36 → 4464.04] that Jesus wins in the end.
[4464.82 → 4467.90] That's the third thing that I want you to take away from this.
[4468.46 → 4472.80] This passage reminds us that we inhabit a world with three actors.
[4473.38 → 4473.74] God?
[4473.94 → 4474.12] Yeah.
[4474.76 → 4475.42] We know that.
[4475.88 → 4476.44] Humanity?
[4476.98 → 4477.34] Okay.
[4478.52 → 4482.76] But there are, as Paul says, principalities and powers.
[4482.76 → 4486.50] There is personal evil and there is Satan.
[4487.78 → 4494.08] And what was happening on the cross of Christ is that Jesus on the cross was triumphing over those powers.
[4494.78 → 4495.12] Right?
[4495.22 → 4498.70] He competed with them, and he defeated them.
[4499.76 → 4505.06] And for reasons that he doesn't tell us, he left them kind of in the throes of death.
[4505.30 → 4506.64] Not fully defeated.
[4506.64 → 4510.52] And according to this passage, they're kind of thrashing around.
[4510.86 → 4511.92] They're harming people.
[4512.42 → 4514.00] They're leading people astray.
[4514.72 → 4519.38] But this passage reminds us that there is a coming day when the rider on the white horse,
[4519.88 → 4523.38] as Revelation tells us, whose name is faithful and true,
[4523.84 → 4527.78] will appear, and he will finish the victory that he has already won.
[4527.78 → 4532.56] And he will bring to nothing all evil by the mere breath of his mouth.
[4534.22 → 4537.02] So, brothers and sisters, don't be afraid.
[4537.18 → 4537.88] Don't be shaken.
[4538.90 → 4539.90] But live like a Christian.
[4540.78 → 4541.62] Hold on to the faith.
[4541.76 → 4542.34] Stand firm.
[4543.12 → 4545.64] Like God calls us to.
[4547.02 → 4548.12] So let's pray together.
[4548.72 → 4554.80] And I want us, I'm going to pray this closing prayer with a prayer that is from the Book of Common Prayer.
[4555.88 → 4556.74] Let's pray together.
[4556.74 → 4562.66] O God, whose blessed Son came into the world,
[4563.24 → 4565.58] that he might destroy the works of the devil
[4565.58 → 4569.58] and make us children of God and heirs of eternal life.
[4570.42 → 4573.46] Grant that when he comes with power and great glory,
[4574.32 → 4578.58] we may be made like him in his eternal and glorious kingdom,
[4579.04 → 4581.60] where he lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit,
[4581.76 → 4583.60] one God, forever and ever.
[4584.28 → 4584.62] Amen.
[4584.62 → 4584.72] Amen.
[4586.74 → 4590.30] So let's stand, and we will sing our song of response.
[4590.62 → 4592.48] My soul longs for the Lord.
[4592.48 → 4593.48] Amen.
[4622.48 → 4624.48] Amen.
[4652.48 → 4654.48] Amen.
[4682.48 → 4684.48] Amen.
[4712.48 → 4714.48] Amen.
[4742.48 → 4744.48] Amen.
[4772.48 → 4774.48] Amen.
[4802.48 → 4803.48] Amen.
[4803.48 → 4804.48] Amen.
[4804.48 → 4806.48] Amen.
[4806.48 → 4808.48] Amen.
[4808.48 → 4809.48] Amen.
[4809.48 → 4810.48] Amen.
[4810.48 → 4811.48] Amen.
[4811.48 → 4818.48] So let's come before the Lord together in a prayer of supplication and intercession,
[4818.48 → 4824.48] where we lift the concerns of our hearts that we share as a church community.
[4824.48 → 4828.62] We bring them before the Lord, the God who hears and who cares for us.
[4829.82 → 4834.86] And who is still active in this world, in all of our situations that we face.
[4835.16 → 4836.42] So let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[4841.12 → 4846.10] Heavenly Father, there is so much in our hearts,
[4847.38 → 4853.94] so much in our families, in our church, in our community, in the world.
[4854.48 → 4856.04] Lord, that needs your healing.
[4857.90 → 4861.76] Lord, that's why it's so good for us to think about your coming again.
[4861.76 → 4871.44] Because that coming has been the hope of Christians for generation after generation.
[4873.24 → 4880.60] That those before us who face persecution, who went into the Lions Arena,
[4880.60 → 4888.80] who even today are being persecuted, but who hold on to their confession,
[4890.04 → 4896.00] do so not because there was a guy a long time ago who lived a pretty good life,
[4896.08 → 4897.42] and that's a good model for us,
[4897.42 → 4904.00] but that the conquering Lord will come again
[4904.00 → 4908.44] and will bring justice to bear
[4908.44 → 4915.58] and will heal and renew everything broken by the fall.
[4916.84 → 4918.46] Lord, we long for that day.
[4919.66 → 4920.44] Come, Lord Jesus.
[4920.44 → 4928.12] Lord, and so we also lift to you the many concerns of our hearts.
[4928.26 → 4935.98] Lord, we look again at the news and see yet another wave of COVID-19,
[4936.20 → 4943.76] a new variant that is spreading in many new cases, hospitals being filled up.
[4943.76 → 4945.88] Lord, would you have mercy?
[4946.00 → 4953.36] Would you bring a swift end to this disease that is all around the world?
[4954.56 → 4958.50] Lord, we lift to you our governing authorities.
[4959.56 → 4961.30] You command us to pray for them.
[4961.98 → 4963.82] So, Lord, we ask that you would give them wisdom
[4963.82 → 4966.64] in the face of much uncertainty.
[4966.64 → 4974.20] Lord, we pray for those serving in hospitals, doctors and nurses,
[4974.96 → 4976.16] who are very tired.
[4977.06 → 4978.34] Lord, would you give them strength?
[4980.20 → 4983.36] Lord, we also pray for those in our own church family, Lord,
[4983.42 → 4986.20] who need your carrying hand upon them.
[4986.32 → 4987.66] Lord, we think of Joan Barman,
[4988.28 → 4994.58] who is just in her continued battle with cancer.
[4994.58 → 4998.04] And, Lord, we thank you that she can be at home
[4998.04 → 5001.50] and that she can receive care with people coming to the home.
[5001.60 → 5004.28] She can receive medication to lessen the pain.
[5005.14 → 5007.40] But, Lord, we pray for your healing upon her.
[5008.10 → 5009.78] We pray that you would heal her body,
[5009.88 → 5014.40] and we thank you that you will answer that prayer on the last day.
[5015.70 → 5018.34] But even now, in the meantime, Lord, would you heal her?
[5018.62 → 5020.44] Would you give her, Lord, strength
[5020.44 → 5023.88] that comes from you alone by your grace in her life?
[5024.76 → 5026.96] Lord, we also lift to you
[5026.96 → 5029.02] Salem, Kia,
[5029.64 → 5031.84] who just recently had a baby by C-section,
[5031.98 → 5033.82] but, Lord, she is in the hospital
[5033.82 → 5036.80] with an infection from her cesarean section.
[5038.08 → 5039.58] Lord, would you have mercy upon her?
[5039.68 → 5043.44] Would you be with Kikuyu as well in the family?
[5044.50 → 5046.68] Lord, would you be with the doctors
[5046.68 → 5049.36] that Salem, Lord, would be healed,
[5049.36 → 5053.76] that nothing further would happen,
[5053.92 → 5055.32] Lord, that she would be able to come home soon.
[5056.46 → 5058.60] But, Lord, not only do we have many concerns
[5058.60 → 5061.84] to bring to you, many that were also not named,
[5061.96 → 5065.14] those also struggling with sickness and cancer as well,
[5065.80 → 5068.24] but, Lord, we also have celebrations in mind.
[5069.06 → 5069.96] Lord, there's so much
[5069.96 → 5072.56] that even in the midst of a broken world
[5072.56 → 5074.42] that you do because, Lord, you are here.
[5074.42 → 5077.56] The man of lawlessness is being restrained.
[5078.12 → 5080.36] The Holy Spirit is powerful and at work.
[5081.18 → 5082.86] Lord, we give you thanks for the baptisms
[5082.86 → 5083.70] that we witnessed.
[5085.54 → 5088.38] Lord, we also ask that you would continue
[5088.38 → 5089.30] to grow our church.
[5089.42 → 5090.72] Lord, we pray for our church.
[5092.06 → 5094.02] Lord, all of us need to pray for our church.
[5095.94 → 5096.98] And, Lord, we thank you
[5096.98 → 5098.64] for the growth of our Mandarin ministry.
[5098.64 → 5102.42] We thank you for the new life that we see,
[5103.12 → 5104.92] the nations coming to know you.
[5105.76 → 5107.88] Lord, would you be with Tracy and Jenny again?
[5108.66 → 5110.08] Lord, continue to hold them
[5110.08 → 5112.98] and keep them, shield them by faith
[5112.98 → 5114.36] for that last day.
[5115.36 → 5116.58] Lord, we also give you thanks
[5116.58 → 5119.20] for Hans and Sylvia.
[5119.90 → 5122.38] They're celebrating their 60th anniversary.
[5123.68 → 5125.94] Lord, what a blessing,
[5125.94 → 5129.02] what a witness
[5129.02 → 5131.06] to what your grace can do
[5131.06 → 5133.10] in people's lives.
[5133.30 → 5134.56] Lord, we celebrate with them.
[5135.70 → 5137.68] We thank you for the great joy
[5137.68 → 5139.52] that they can experience.
[5139.66 → 5140.34] And, Lord, would you give them
[5140.34 → 5141.46] many more years of marriage.
[5142.42 → 5145.78] Lord, we celebrate them today.
[5147.58 → 5151.04] Lord, we thank you
[5151.04 → 5152.46] for this Christmas season coming up.
[5153.18 → 5153.78] Lord, we thank you
[5153.78 → 5155.62] for the chance to celebrate
[5155.62 → 5158.38] your birth this coming Christmas Eve.
[5159.54 → 5161.10] Lord, prepare our hearts.
[5161.74 → 5162.76] Lord, to welcome you
[5162.76 → 5163.82] into our hearts
[5163.82 → 5165.34] as we, as you,
[5165.46 → 5167.00] as the world welcomed the Lord
[5167.00 → 5168.92] many years ago.
[5169.60 → 5171.16] Lord, we pray all of these things
[5171.16 → 5173.18] in the name of the faithful
[5173.18 → 5174.04] and true one,
[5174.20 → 5175.08] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5175.58 → 5176.84] We pray in his holy name.
[5177.18 → 5177.40] Amen.
[5177.40 → 5181.78] Would you please stand
[5181.78 → 5182.42] and receive
[5182.42 → 5185.24] this word of blessing?
[5186.04 → 5187.40] It comes from
[5187.40 → 5188.66] 2 Thessalonians 2,
[5188.74 → 5189.84] just a couple verses later.
[5189.96 → 5191.04] This is what Paul says
[5191.04 → 5193.60] after he comforts them.
[5194.48 → 5195.02] He says,
[5195.02 → 5197.78] May our Lord Jesus Christ himself
[5198.34 → 5199.04] and God,
[5199.18 → 5199.86] our Father,
[5199.98 → 5201.52] who loved us by his grace,
[5202.30 → 5204.24] give us eternal encouragement
[5204.24 → 5205.48] and good hope.
[5206.44 → 5207.54] Encourage your hearts
[5207.54 → 5209.20] and strengthen you
[5209.20 → 5210.62] in every good word and deed.
[5210.62 → 5211.96] Amen.
[5211.96 → 5212.06] Amen.
[5212.06 → 5234.80] Salvation belongs to our God
[5234.80 → 5239.80] who sits upon the throne
[5239.80 → 5245.58] and unto the Lamb
[5245.58 → 5248.08] praise and glory,
[5248.88 → 5251.04] wisdom and thanks,
[5251.42 → 5255.88] honour and power and strength.
[5256.54 → 5258.54] Be to our God
[5258.54 → 5261.36] forever and ever,
[5261.36 → 5263.82] be to our God
[5263.82 → 5266.56] forever and ever,
[5266.98 → 5269.02] be to our God
[5269.02 → 5271.80] forever and ever.
[5271.80 → 5272.80] Amen.
[5276.80 → 5279.48] And we, the redeemed,
[5279.60 → 5281.54] shall be strong
[5281.54 → 5287.30] in purpose and unity,
[5287.30 → 5292.02] declaring our love
[5292.56 → 5295.12] praise and glory,
[5295.88 → 5297.86] wisdom and thanks,
[5297.86 → 5301.64] honour and power and strength.
[5301.64 → 5305.64] Be to our God
[5305.64 → 5307.64] forever and ever,
[5307.64 → 5310.84] be to our God
[5310.84 → 5313.46] forever and ever,
[5313.64 → 5315.90] be to our God
[5315.90 → 5318.64] forever and ever.
[5318.64 → 5319.78] Amen.
[5319.78 → 5329.32] Lord,
[5329.32 → 5334.40] orb Meh 1, in 16,
[5334.40 → 5334.70] Jesus,
[5334.70 → 5335.56] be to our God
[5335.56 → 5337.30] forever and ever,
[5337.30 → 5337.82] be to our God
[5337.82 → 5338.30] forever and ever,
[5338.30 → 5338.78] ever,
[5338.84 → 5339.84] be to our God
[5339.84 → 5341.14] forever and ever,
[5341.14 → 5341.52] be to our God
[5341.52 → 5341.92] ever,
[5341.92 → 5342.20] forever and ever,
[5342.44 → 5343.44] be to our God
[5343.44 → 5343.80] forever and ever,
[5343.80 → 5344.42] ever,
[5344.42 → 5344.52] ever.
[5344.52 → 5345.12] end fuel,
[5345.12 → 5346.52] may it be to our God
[5346.52 → 5347.06] and ever,
[5347.06 → 5348.52] never be to our God
