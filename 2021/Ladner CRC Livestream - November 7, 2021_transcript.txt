[327.00 --> 336.84]  We are here to worship the living God, and from him we are here to seek his help and healing and his deliverance.
[337.76 --> 343.28]  So before we begin our worship service this morning, I just have a couple of announcements for us.
[343.62 --> 349.22]  First, our designated offering for this Sunday is World Renew's World Hunger Program.
[349.22 --> 359.02]  And we are still not collecting the offering bag, but you can give by dropping off your donation in the boxes on both sides near the door.
[359.64 --> 363.56]  And of course you can also give online or mail or drop off a check.
[364.98 --> 372.80]  I also want to invite everyone, if you are available, to come to our Wednesday morning coffee break Bible studies for men and women.
[373.36 --> 375.58]  We are studying the Gospel of John together.
[375.58 --> 381.58]  It's a great time to, kind of in the middle of the week, to be able to come and to fellowship and to study God's Word together.
[381.90 --> 382.84]  So that's been really good.
[383.60 --> 389.88]  Also, I wanted to make sure you are aware, but we have a membership class coming up.
[391.22 --> 395.96]  It will be November 23rd, 30, and December 7th.
[395.96 --> 397.78]  Three weeks, three times.
[398.38 --> 402.92]  And it's going to be on Tuesday evening at 7 p.m. over Zoom.
[402.92 --> 404.16]  Okay?
[404.46 --> 416.30]  And this is a class that is great for, even if you're new to Latin or CRC, and you want to know more about, you know, what are our distinctives as a church, kind of our history, our denomination.
[417.50 --> 419.48]  That's something that you can come to.
[419.78 --> 423.54]  And it's also required to become a member.
[424.74 --> 427.52]  So, welcome.
[427.52 --> 431.78]  So, please take note.
[431.94 --> 434.88]  The announcements are in your bulletin, the membership class coming up.
[437.70 --> 442.58]  So, let's prepare our hearts for worship this morning.
[443.14 --> 448.50]  Our call to worship is from the words of Jesus in Matthew 16.
[448.50 --> 456.54]  Because following Jesus is a call to follow him with our whole lives.
[457.48 --> 458.76]  Dietrich Bonhoeffer said,
[458.92 --> 466.54]  When Christ calls a man or a woman, he bids him come and die that we might find a new life in him.
[467.54 --> 470.00]  So, Jesus says this in Matthew 16.
[470.00 --> 472.28]  Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[472.28 --> 479.20]  Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
[479.74 --> 482.74]  For whoever wants to save their life will lose it.
[483.42 --> 487.36]  But whoever loses their life for me will find it.
[487.36 --> 492.98]  Let's take a moment now in silence before the Lord.
[494.12 --> 500.28]  To weigh on him who promises to be present in the assembly of his people.
[501.08 --> 502.44]  Let's take a moment of silence.
[517.36 --> 519.08]  Would you please pray with me?
[520.74 --> 524.62]  Lord, right now we turn our eyes to you.
[525.90 --> 529.84]  Where we are weary, Lord, you are strong.
[530.56 --> 535.58]  Where we are confused, you know all things clearly.
[536.68 --> 541.16]  Where we are changeable, you are stable.
[542.26 --> 544.58]  And so, Lord, it is to you we come.
[544.58 --> 548.06]  In our sickness, we come to you as our healer.
[549.06 --> 552.08]  In our slavery, we come to you as our liberator.
[553.06 --> 556.32]  Where we are afraid, we come to you as our comforter.
[557.50 --> 562.68]  Living God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you are merciful and kind and patient.
[563.32 --> 568.20]  And you are eager to meet with us and to renew us by your Holy Spirit.
[568.58 --> 570.50]  All glory to you, God.
[570.96 --> 572.30]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[572.86 --> 573.20]  Amen.
[573.20 --> 573.30]  Amen.
[574.58 --> 575.96]  So, I invite you now to stand.
[576.36 --> 581.22]  If you are able, God greets us with these words through the prophet Isaiah.
[581.94 --> 582.68]  He says,
[582.90 --> 584.68]  For your maker is your husband.
[585.32 --> 587.66]  The Lord Almighty is his name.
[587.88 --> 590.40]  The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer.
[591.06 --> 594.76]  He is called the God of all the earth.
[594.76 --> 602.28]  So, as God has greeted us and he has welcomed us and called us into this assembly of his people,
[602.80 --> 605.78]  I invite you to turn and extend that greeting to one another.
[605.78 --> 613.98]  Let's do him if you want us to turn and turn to the king of his people.
[613.98 --> 615.56]  Amen.
[615.56 --> 616.52]  Amen.
[616.52 --> 617.34]  Amen.
[617.34 --> 617.92]  Amen.
[617.92 --> 618.56]  Amen.
[618.56 --> 618.82]  Amen.
[618.82 --> 619.12]  Amen.
[619.12 --> 619.90]  Amen.
[619.90 --> 621.84]  Amen.
[621.84 --> 622.46]  Amen.
[622.46 --> 623.12]  Amen.
[623.12 --> 624.22]  Amen.
[624.52 --> 626.24]  Amen.
[626.24 --> 626.88]  Amen.
[626.88 --> 627.02]  Amen.
[627.02 --> 627.60]  Amen.
[628.66 --> 629.08]  Amen.
[629.08 --> 629.56]  Amen.
[629.56 --> 629.74]  Amen.
[629.74 --> 630.24]  Amen.
[630.44 --> 630.88]  Amen.
[630.88 --> 630.92]  Amen.
[630.92 --> 631.64]  Amen.
[631.64 --> 631.94]  Senatemediate.
[631.94 --> 649.46]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[649.46 --> 652.82]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[653.20 --> 655.80]  I want to see you.
[657.24 --> 660.42]  I want to see you.
[661.94 --> 666.34]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[667.12 --> 669.94]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[670.32 --> 672.92]  I want to see you.
[674.20 --> 677.46]  I want to see you.
[678.50 --> 682.82]  To see you high and lifted up.
[683.96 --> 687.00]  Shining in the light of your glory.
[687.74 --> 691.08]  Pour out your power and love.
[691.08 --> 695.48]  As we sing holy, holy, holy.
[698.42 --> 702.46]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[703.00 --> 706.06]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[706.36 --> 708.86]  I want to see you.
[708.86 --> 713.26]  I want to see you.
[713.26 --> 714.26]  I want to see you.
[714.26 --> 718.24]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[718.24 --> 720.24]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[720.24 --> 724.20]  I want to see you.
[724.20 --> 725.20]  I want to see you.
[725.20 --> 729.04]  I want to see you.
[729.04 --> 729.58]  I want to see you.
[729.58 --> 734.98]  To see you high and lifted up.
[734.98 --> 739.56]  Shining in the light of your glory
[739.56 --> 743.48]  Pour out your power and love
[743.48 --> 747.76]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[747.76 --> 751.98]  Holy, holy, holy
[751.98 --> 756.18]  Holy, holy, holy
[756.18 --> 760.32]  Holy, holy, holy
[760.32 --> 763.54]  I want to see you
[763.54 --> 768.70]  Holy, holy, holy
[768.70 --> 772.80]  Holy, holy, holy
[772.80 --> 776.82]  Holy, holy, holy
[776.82 --> 780.26]  I want to see you
[793.54 --> 812.98]  Wonderful, so wonderful
[812.98 --> 816.98]  Is your unfailing love
[816.98 --> 823.42]  Your cross has spoken mercy over me
[823.42 --> 829.24]  No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[829.24 --> 832.46]  No heart could fully know
[832.46 --> 839.62]  How glorious, how beautiful you are
[839.62 --> 844.46]  Beautiful one I love
[844.46 --> 847.46]  Beautiful one I adore
[847.46 --> 855.46]  Beautiful one my soul must sing
[855.46 --> 860.62]  Powerful, so powerful

[862.62 --> 866.62]  Your glory fills the skies
[866.62 --> 872.62]  Your mighty words display for all to see
[872.62 --> 877.78]  The beauty of your majesty
[877.78 --> 878.78]  The beauty of your majesty
[878.78 --> 881.88]  Awakes my heart to sing
[881.88 --> 889.06]  How marvelous, how wonderful you are
[889.06 --> 894.22]  Beautiful one I love
[894.22 --> 898.32]  Beautiful one I adore
[898.32 --> 905.50]  Beautiful one my soul must sing
[905.50 --> 910.66]  You've opened my eyes to your wonders
[910.66 --> 915.54]  You've captured my heart with this love
[915.54 --> 920.66]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you
[920.66 --> 935.82]  Beautiful one I love
[935.82 --> 939.82]  Beautiful one I love
[939.82 --> 941.82]  Beautiful one I adore

[955.98 --> 959.98]  Beautiful one I adore
[959.98 --> 970.98]  Beautiful one my soul must sing
[970.98 --> 997.02]  What a friend we have in Jesus
[997.02 --> 1002.02]  All our sins and grace to bear
[1002.02 --> 1009.02]  What a privilege to carry
[1009.02 --> 1015.02]  Everything to God in prayer
[1015.02 --> 1019.02]  Oh, what peace we often forfeit
[1019.02 --> 1023.02]  Oh, what needless peace we often forfeit
[1023.02 --> 1028.02]  Oh, what needless pain we bear
[1028.02 --> 1035.02]  Oh, because we do not carry
[1035.02 --> 1041.02]  Everything to God in prayer
[1041.02 --> 1047.02]  Have we trials and temptations
[1047.02 --> 1048.02]  Is there trouble anywhere?
[1048.02 --> 1049.02]  Is there trouble anywhere?
[1049.02 --> 1050.02]  We shall never be discouraged
[1050.02 --> 1052.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1052.02 --> 1054.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1054.02 --> 1056.02]  Can we find a friend so faithful
[1056.02 --> 1057.02]  Who will all our sorrows share?
[1057.02 --> 1059.02]  Jesus knows our every week
[1059.02 --> 1062.02]  We shall never be discouraged
[1062.02 --> 1063.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1063.02 --> 1067.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1067.02 --> 1069.02]  Can we find a friend so faithful
[1069.02 --> 1070.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1070.02 --> 1074.02]  Can we find a friend so faithful
[1074.02 --> 1079.02]  Who will all our sorrows share?
[1079.02 --> 1082.02]  Jesus knows our every week
[1082.02 --> 1084.02]  Jesus knows our every week
[1084.02 --> 1086.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1086.02 --> 1088.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1088.02 --> 1090.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1090.02 --> 1092.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1092.02 --> 1094.02]  Are we weak and heavy laden
[1094.02 --> 1101.02]  Are we weak and heavy laden
[1101.02 --> 1107.02]  Compered with a load of care
[1107.02 --> 1114.02]  Precious Savior, still our refuge
[1114.02 --> 1119.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1119.02 --> 1129.02]  Do your friends despise, forsake you
[1129.02 --> 1134.02]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[1134.02 --> 1141.02]  In His arms He'll take and shield you
[1141.02 --> 1149.02]  You will find a solace there
[1161.02 --> 1163.02]  You know, we come this morning
[1163.02 --> 1169.02]  and oftentimes we come and we are, as we just sang, kind of burdened, right?
[1169.02 --> 1171.02]  We're burdened with our own sin
[1171.02 --> 1175.02]  We're burdened by anxieties and troubles
[1175.02 --> 1177.02]  And we can take it to the Lord in prayer
[1177.02 --> 1179.02]  And so that's what I want to invite us to do right now
[1179.02 --> 1181.02]  In this time of confession
[1181.02 --> 1184.02]  Where we can just take all that is burdening us
[1184.02 --> 1187.02]  And we can bring it before the cross
[1187.02 --> 1191.02]  So would you please join me in this prayer to the Lord
[1191.02 --> 1193.02]  This prayer of confession
[1193.02 --> 1198.02]  Oh Heavenly Father, God and Father
[1198.02 --> 1200.02]  And Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1200.02 --> 1203.02]  God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
[1203.02 --> 1205.02]  Lord, you made all things
[1205.02 --> 1207.02]  You sustain all things
[1207.02 --> 1209.02]  You will judge all things
[1209.02 --> 1213.02]  Our hearts we lay bare before you
[1213.02 --> 1217.02]  Asking that we would trust in you alone
[1217.02 --> 1221.02]  Forgive us, Lord, when we trust in lesser things
[1221.02 --> 1223.02]  And when we have not trusted in you
[1223.02 --> 1230.02]  Forgive us, Father, for every way in which we have held back something for ourselves
[1230.02 --> 1237.02]  Forgive us, Father, for the ways we have not built our lives upon your love
[1237.02 --> 1242.02]  Forgive us, Lord, for where we have disobeyed your commandments
[1242.02 --> 1245.02]  Where we have neglected your law
[1245.02 --> 1247.02]  Where we have grieved the Spirit
[1247.02 --> 1249.02]  And have not yielded ourselves to you
[1249.02 --> 1255.02]  Where we have not been filled with love and faithfulness and gentleness and self-control
[1257.02 --> 1261.02]  Forgive us, Lord, for where we have failed to forgive those who sin against us
[1261.02 --> 1266.02]  Forgive us, Lord, for all of our sins in word and thought and deed
[1266.02 --> 1272.02]  Forgive our sins both corporately as your people
[1272.02 --> 1274.02]  And our sins individually
[1274.02 --> 1277.02]  We want to offer all of our life to you, Lord
[1277.02 --> 1280.02]  Because you are worthy of all glory and honor and praise
[1280.02 --> 1284.02]  Our hearts are restless until they rest in you, Lord
[1284.02 --> 1287.02]  You are the one for whom we were made
[1287.02 --> 1291.02]  We need you not just as a periphery in our life somewhere
[1291.02 --> 1296.02]  But as the foundation and bedrock upon which we build our lives
[1296.02 --> 1299.02]  And so we look, Lord, to the blood of your Son
[1299.02 --> 1303.02]  Our Lord Jesus Christ that washes us and makes us clean
[1303.02 --> 1306.02]  We carry to you our great heaps of sin
[1306.02 --> 1308.02]  And we lay them at the foot of the cross
[1308.02 --> 1314.02]  Lord, so that through your Son you might bear them for us
[1314.02 --> 1318.02]  And that in his place we might receive your blessing
[1318.02 --> 1324.02]  We come to you because you are our Father who loves us
[1324.02 --> 1328.02]  Because we belong to you through your Son Jesus Christ
[1328.02 --> 1332.02]  And it is in the name of Jesus who reigns and lives with you
[1332.02 --> 1335.02]  One God forever and ever, we pray, Amen
[1335.02 --> 1342.02]  Friends, if you confess your sins in Jesus' name
[1342.02 --> 1344.02]  Then these words of assurance are for you
[1344.02 --> 1348.02]  These words come from Isaiah 54
[1348.02 --> 1351.02]  For a brief moment I abandon you
[1351.02 --> 1354.02]  But with deep compassion I will bring you back
[1354.02 --> 1357.02]  In a surge of anger I hid my face from you
[1357.02 --> 1361.02]  For a moment, but with everlasting kindness
[1361.02 --> 1365.02]  I will have compassion on you, says the Lord your Redeemer
[1365.02 --> 1369.02]  Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed
[1369.02 --> 1372.02]  Yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken
[1372.02 --> 1379.02]  Nor my covenant of peace be removed, says the Lord who has compassion on you
[1379.02 --> 1381.02]  This is God's word
[1381.02 --> 1387.02]  Let's stand together and let's sing this song of response and of assurance
[1387.02 --> 1388.02]  Please rise
[1388.02 --> 1393.02]  I should say this is a new song that we're going to be introducing
[1393.02 --> 1395.02]  It's called Christ is Mine for Everymore
[1395.02 --> 1398.02]  Feel free to use this time to just meditate on the words
[1398.02 --> 1402.02]  But of course please join in if you feel comfortable
[1402.02 --> 1417.02]  Mine are days that God has numbered
[1417.02 --> 1421.02]  I was made to walk with Him
[1421.02 --> 1426.02]  Yet I look for worldly treasures
[1426.02 --> 1430.02]  And forsake the King of kings
[1430.02 --> 1435.02]  But mine is hope in my Redeemer
[1435.02 --> 1439.02]  Though I fall, His love is sure
[1439.02 --> 1444.02]  For Christ has paid for every failing
[1444.02 --> 1449.02]  I am His forevermore
[1449.02 --> 1464.02]  Mine are tears in times of sorrow
[1464.02 --> 1468.02]  Darkness not yet understood
[1468.02 --> 1473.02]  Through the valley I must travel
[1473.02 --> 1477.02]  Where I see no earthly good
[1477.02 --> 1482.02]  But mine is peace that flows from heaven
[1482.02 --> 1486.02]  And the strength in times of need
[1486.02 --> 1491.02]  I know my pain will not be wasted
[1491.02 --> 1496.02]  Christ completes His work in me
[1496.02 --> 1511.02]  Mine are days here as a stranger
[1511.02 --> 1515.02]  Pilgrim on a narrow way
[1515.02 --> 1520.02]  One with bright star will encounter
[1520.02 --> 1524.02]  Harm and hatred for His name
[1524.02 --> 1529.02]  But mine is honor for His battle
[1529.02 --> 1534.02]  Strong enough to last the war
[1534.02 --> 1539.02]  And He has said He will deliver
[1539.02 --> 1543.02]  Safely to the golden shore
[1543.02 --> 1548.02]  And mine are peace to Zion City
[1548.02 --> 1551.02]  Where beside the King I walk
[1551.02 --> 1553.02]  Where beside the King I walk
[1553.02 --> 1558.02]  For there my heart has found His treasure
[1558.02 --> 1562.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1562.02 --> 1567.02]  And mine are keys to Zion City
[1567.02 --> 1571.02]  Where beside the King I walk
[1571.02 --> 1573.02]  Where beside the King I walk
[1573.02 --> 1574.02]  For there my heart has found His treasure
[1574.02 --> 1576.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1576.02 --> 1578.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1578.02 --> 1582.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1582.02 --> 1584.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1584.02 --> 1597.02]  Christ is mine forevermore
[1597.82 --> 1604.02]  So at this time, the children may go to their Sunday school classes, and let us prepare
[1604.02 --> 1605.70]  our hearts for the reading of God's Word.
[1627.02 --> 1637.02]  Good morning.
[1637.02 --> 1649.16]  We'll be reading from 1 Corinthians 6-9 and 1 Corinthians 7, 25-35.
[1649.16 --> 1652.56]  I say this as a concession, not as a command.
[1652.56 --> 1656.38]  I wish all of you were as I am.
[1656.38 --> 1659.68]  But each of you has your own gift from God.
[1659.68 --> 1663.86]  One has this gift, and another has that.
[1663.86 --> 1668.88]  Now to the unmarried and to the widower say, it is good for them to stay unmarried as I
[1668.88 --> 1670.18]  do.
[1670.18 --> 1674.06]  But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.
[1674.06 --> 1679.28]  For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[1679.28 --> 1680.84]  Now about virgins.
[1680.84 --> 1683.24]  I have no command from the Lord.
[1683.24 --> 1688.22]  But I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
[1688.22 --> 1694.06]  Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[1694.06 --> 1696.00]  Are you pledged to a woman?
[1696.00 --> 1699.54]  Do not seek to be released.
[1699.54 --> 1701.54]  Are you free from such a commitment?
[1701.54 --> 1703.84]  Do not look for a wife.
[1703.84 --> 1705.84]  But if you do marry, you have not sinned.
[1705.84 --> 1709.46]  And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
[1709.46 --> 1712.96]  But those who marry will face many troubles in this life.
[1712.96 --> 1715.68]  And I want to spare you this.
[1715.68 --> 1719.52]  What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that time is short.
[1719.52 --> 1723.22]  From now on, those who have wives should live as they do not.
[1723.22 --> 1726.48]  Those who mourn as if they did not.
[1726.48 --> 1729.78]  Those who are happy as if they were not.
[1729.78 --> 1733.88]  Those who buy something as if it was not theirs to keep.
[1733.88 --> 1738.54]  Those who use the things of this world as if not engrossed in them.
[1738.54 --> 1742.48]  For this world in its present form is passing away.
[1742.48 --> 1744.66]  I would like to free you from concern.
[1744.66 --> 1750.86]  As an unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs, how can he please the Lord?
[1750.86 --> 1754.28]  But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world.
[1754.28 --> 1756.46]  How he can please his wife.
[1756.46 --> 1758.50]  And his interests are divided.
[1758.50 --> 1762.04]  An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[1762.04 --> 1766.14]  Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit.
[1766.14 --> 1769.88]  But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world.
[1769.88 --> 1772.28]  How she can please her husband.
[1772.28 --> 1774.90]  I am saying this for your own good.
[1774.90 --> 1776.56]  Not to restrict you.
[1776.56 --> 1784.78]  But that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
[1784.78 --> 1788.74]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1788.74 --> 1796.58]  Thanks be to God.
[1796.58 --> 1799.96]  What a passage.
[1799.96 --> 1800.96]  Any questions?
[1800.96 --> 1805.42]  I have a lot of questions.
[1805.42 --> 1810.98]  So we're in a shorter kind of four week series called Sacred Calling.
[1810.98 --> 1815.58]  And we're looking at these kind of hot topics of marriage and sex and singleness.
[1815.58 --> 1819.30]  And what the Bible teaches us about these things.
[1819.30 --> 1822.24]  And today we're going to be looking at this topic of singleness.
[1822.24 --> 1825.28]  Now if you're thinking, well, I'm not single.
[1825.28 --> 1828.52]  You know, maybe I could have slept in this morning.
[1828.52 --> 1831.32]  Even past the extra hour that we already got.
[1831.42 --> 1832.80]  I could be at home drinking my coffee.
[1833.62 --> 1839.20]  So let me give you a couple reasons why all of us need to consider what the Bible has to say about singleness.
[1839.20 --> 1842.30]  First, some of us are single.
[1842.30 --> 1843.14]  Right?
[1843.14 --> 1844.10]  So this really matters.
[1844.10 --> 1847.88]  This is about us and our lives today, right now.
[1847.88 --> 1852.90]  Secondly, you know, I don't know of a gentle way to say this.
[1853.34 --> 1858.84]  But for those of us who are married, most of us are going to be single again one day.
[1859.56 --> 1860.08]  Right?
[1860.16 --> 1865.18]  Either through divorce or through our spouses passing away before us.
[1865.84 --> 1866.36]  Right?
[1866.46 --> 1868.52]  And some of us are in that season right now.
[1868.52 --> 1878.74]  For those of us who are married here this morning, then, thinking that marriage has kind of fixed this potential problem of having to deal with singleness.
[1879.48 --> 1880.88]  Well, friends, that's just not true.
[1882.38 --> 1888.48]  And then thirdly, this is a huge issue in our society today.
[1888.48 --> 1903.24]  According to a news report I found on CBC, the number of Canadians living alone has more than doubled in the last 35 years, making single-person households the most common type of household in Canada.
[1904.68 --> 1904.80]  Right?
[1907.38 --> 1908.54]  Can you turn this down a bit?
[1908.62 --> 1909.74]  It feels a bit loud.
[1910.08 --> 1910.32]  Thanks.
[1910.32 --> 1921.44]  So most of us, you know, because this is such a huge thing in our society, most of us will probably have family members, friends, neighbors who are single.
[1921.80 --> 1924.66]  And so we want to know, what does the Bible have to say about this?
[1925.48 --> 1928.36]  And what is God's heart for single people?
[1929.68 --> 1932.12]  So this is a topic that really applies to all of us.
[1932.12 --> 1940.96]  And just as our culture has different views on marriage and sex, in the same way, there are different views about singleness.
[1941.30 --> 1944.10]  You know, there's a traditional view and there's a modern view.
[1944.86 --> 1950.94]  So what's the traditional view pretty much equates singleness with loneliness.
[1952.20 --> 1960.98]  And I'm not only talking about this idea, you know, we might have in our minds of a single person, you know, in their apartment eating a bowl of ramen noodles by themselves.
[1962.12 --> 1968.66]  But it's even more this idea of being single means that somehow you are incomplete as a human being.
[1969.14 --> 1970.32]  This is the traditional view.
[1970.82 --> 1975.58]  And I think one of the places we see this most clearly is in Disney movies.
[1976.52 --> 1980.88]  Think of some of the earliest iconic, you know, Disney princesses.
[1980.88 --> 1994.78]  Often what is being portrayed is you have especially a woman who has no meaning or purpose in life other than finding her soulmate, finding her Prince Charming.
[1996.00 --> 1999.14]  You know, in Snow White, she is literally unconscious.
[1999.92 --> 2004.82]  And a man has to kiss her and awaken her and they live happily ever after.
[2004.82 --> 2007.22]  Friends, this is bad theology.
[2007.46 --> 2016.68]  I mean, okay, if this was a picture of Jesus coming to awaken us out of the sleep of death, right, that's biblical.
[2017.00 --> 2022.16]  But this is not how we are to understand our relationships with one another's human beings.
[2023.60 --> 2028.00]  And then we get to some of the later Disney movies in the 90s with like the little mermaid.
[2029.06 --> 2031.94]  Ariel is a mermaid who longs to be human.
[2031.94 --> 2035.04]  And how can she become human?
[2035.72 --> 2037.66]  Well, she has to fall in love and get married.
[2038.58 --> 2042.98]  And that's the narrative that you get married and you are no longer sort of a half person.
[2043.30 --> 2044.66]  You become fully human.
[2045.70 --> 2045.82]  Right?
[2045.88 --> 2050.86]  And that's kind of how our traditional view of marriage portrays it.
[2052.04 --> 2058.10]  In response to this kind of traditional narrative, modern culture is giving us something else.
[2058.10 --> 2060.32]  It says being single is not about loneliness.
[2060.62 --> 2061.64]  It's about liberation.
[2062.52 --> 2062.70]  Right?
[2062.90 --> 2068.88]  Our culture today would say if you are not married, that's great because that means you're free.
[2069.50 --> 2074.42]  You're free to, you know, play the field, to have lots of different relationships.
[2075.22 --> 2077.28]  You are free from commitment.
[2077.28 --> 2080.66]  And it's like, you know, hey, I'm single.
[2080.80 --> 2087.84]  I'm free to do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want, travel, focus on my career, focus on my education.
[2088.66 --> 2094.50]  You know, just this liberation with no chains of responsibility that comes from being married.
[2094.50 --> 2098.02]  This is probably why more and more people are single.
[2098.82 --> 2108.22]  When we were in Taiwan, you know, we would talk to college age, especially women, young adults, and they would tell us they have no interest in getting married.
[2108.22 --> 2109.54]  They have no plan to be married.
[2110.54 --> 2115.26]  They've seen how bad their marriages were of their parents.
[2115.32 --> 2119.30]  And they say, why would I want to, you know, chain myself to that kind of a relationship?
[2120.22 --> 2120.92]  They're free.
[2121.70 --> 2123.78]  And that's how, that's kind of often our modern view.
[2124.64 --> 2133.32]  But friends, scripture comes to us, and this passage will come to us, and it's going to say that singleness is not about loneliness, and it's not about liberation.
[2134.14 --> 2146.08]  Rather, this passage is going to tell us that singleness is a gift from God, that it is a, there's a calling about this gift, and then that there is also great hope and grace in singleness.
[2146.66 --> 2149.00]  Those are the couple things I will look at from this passage.
[2149.00 --> 2151.16]  So let's take a look together.
[2152.04 --> 2157.30]  The first thing that we see here in our passage is that, is the gift of singleness.
[2158.56 --> 2164.80]  And so let's listen to what the apostle Paul says here, and we're going to kind of start back in that first section we looked at, verse 6.
[2165.62 --> 2166.80]  And this is what Paul says.
[2167.16 --> 2169.92]  I say this as a concession, not as a command.
[2170.76 --> 2174.62]  I wish that all of you were as I am.
[2174.62 --> 2180.40]  Okay, so Paul is writing this letter as a single.
[2181.50 --> 2190.38]  And he's saying that there's a sense in which it would be great if a ton more of you, the church in Corinth, if more of you were single.
[2190.38 --> 2197.80]  And so the first thing we need to recognize as we talk about singleness is what it means.
[2197.90 --> 2198.70]  What are we talking about?
[2199.56 --> 2206.38]  And what Christians mean by singleness is more than simply not being married.
[2206.38 --> 2223.44]  It means we are wanting in our not being married to follow Jesus, who says, among other things, that marriage and sex, well, that sex is a gift only for within a marriage between a man and a woman.
[2223.44 --> 2233.02]  So for those of us who are not married, what we're talking about here is actually celibacy, sexual celibacy.
[2234.80 --> 2236.82]  That word sounds so old, doesn't it?
[2237.46 --> 2237.94]  Celibate.
[2239.20 --> 2244.68]  And I think maybe the reason it sounds so old is that today we just don't have a good concept of it.
[2244.68 --> 2261.22]  And the world around us would actually typically say that singleness of that sort, not singleness where you're free to play the field, but singleness where you are a Christian devoted to faithfulness to God and celibacy, our world would say at best that is laughable.
[2262.52 --> 2266.42]  You know, a movie came out, I was going to say a couple years ago, I had to look it up, it was 2005.
[2267.68 --> 2268.48]  15 years ago.
[2269.20 --> 2270.82]  Called The 40-Year-Old Virgin.
[2270.82 --> 2275.82]  And I haven't seen the movie, you don't have to have seen the movie to know what, what kind of movie is this?
[2277.24 --> 2278.48]  It's a comedy, right?
[2279.18 --> 2280.18]  A 40-year-old virgin.
[2280.88 --> 2284.60]  Because in our culture, it is unthinkable, it's laughable.
[2285.76 --> 2292.94]  And the reason our culture thinks this way is because it says you can't truly be human unless you are fulfilling your sexuality.
[2293.84 --> 2294.22]  Right?
[2294.28 --> 2298.72]  And by not expressing and fulfilling those desires, you're actually not being true to who you are.
[2298.72 --> 2303.78]  And because our sexuality is seen as such a fundamental aspect of our humanity.
[2304.98 --> 2308.12]  Well, you know, there's all kinds of things we could say to that.
[2308.82 --> 2320.70]  But one kind of more obvious observation that we can make is that as Christians, we believe that Jesus Christ was the most fully human being who ever lived.
[2320.70 --> 2324.90]  And yet, he was never married.
[2325.60 --> 2325.78]  Right?
[2325.90 --> 2330.76]  Jesus was never dated, despite what, you know, some kind of popular books might suggest.
[2331.38 --> 2333.56]  He was never in a romantic relationship.
[2333.80 --> 2334.66]  He never had sex.
[2334.66 --> 2346.20]  And so the moment we say that any of those things is essential to being a full, flourishing human being, what we're actually saying is we're diminishing the humanity of Jesus.
[2347.78 --> 2356.20]  But when we look at Jesus, we learn that we can be a full human being without having sex.
[2356.20 --> 2359.56]  And so Paul was single himself.
[2360.80 --> 2364.38]  He says he wishes more Christians in the church were single.
[2364.76 --> 2366.54]  But then he continues on in verse 7.
[2366.78 --> 2369.08]  And he says, we'll have it here.
[2371.58 --> 2375.22]  But each of you has your own gift from God.
[2375.30 --> 2376.12]  One has this gift.
[2376.38 --> 2377.14]  Another has that.
[2377.14 --> 2382.48]  Okay, so God has given people the gift of singleness.
[2383.44 --> 2387.96]  And Paul, or God, has given people the gift of marriage.
[2389.30 --> 2393.44]  My daughter Ellie took a drama class last year in school.
[2393.74 --> 2395.64]  And the teacher, you know, you've got this bunch of kids.
[2395.68 --> 2399.26]  You've got to get them to act and to express themselves in the talk.
[2399.26 --> 2403.66]  And so he'd always start off with kind of an icebreaker question, just something to get the kids talking.
[2404.48 --> 2405.78]  And so, you know, this is fun.
[2405.86 --> 2408.98]  And Ellie would come home and she would share these with us at the dinner table.
[2409.10 --> 2411.10]  We'd all kind of go around and answer the questions.
[2411.62 --> 2415.78]  And one of them I really kind of loved and it just has stuck with me is this question.
[2416.76 --> 2420.70]  If you could have any dollar store superpower, what would it be?
[2421.52 --> 2422.66]  Now, what's a dollar store superpower?
[2423.00 --> 2424.82]  It means you can't choose the big ones.
[2424.82 --> 2429.64]  Okay, you can't choose like invisibility or flying or just super strength.
[2429.74 --> 2430.42]  Nothing like that.
[2430.42 --> 2436.96]  But if you could have just a dollar bin superpower, what would it be?
[2438.34 --> 2439.44]  What would you choose?
[2440.76 --> 2446.50]  I would love to have the superpower where you can make the traffic light turn green.
[2448.26 --> 2450.34]  Or clear out the traffic in the tunnel.
[2450.78 --> 2451.98]  Like, that would be great.
[2451.98 --> 2460.74]  But it's a fun question because apparently we're fascinated with this idea that some people could have a special ability.
[2461.46 --> 2461.70]  Right?
[2461.78 --> 2465.90]  That allows us to do something heroic or at the very least something very useful.
[2466.90 --> 2473.40]  And many of us in the Christian world have so absorbed this idea that singleness is bad for you.
[2473.40 --> 2484.26]  That the only way we can imagine a single person having a way forward is if they have some special superpower, which we call the gift of singleness.
[2485.38 --> 2489.16]  You know, we think, you know, singleness isn't easy.
[2489.94 --> 2492.76]  Some people seem like they're doing okay.
[2493.30 --> 2494.92]  Well, they must have the gift of singleness.
[2494.92 --> 2498.82]  But friends, that's not what Paul is, that's not what this means at all.
[2499.62 --> 2506.32]  When Paul talks about the gift of singleness, he doesn't mean that some people are zapped with the superpower of singleness.
[2507.00 --> 2509.76]  Such that they can flourish in this miserable condition.
[2510.44 --> 2515.96]  What Paul is talking about is the gift of being married and the gift of being single.
[2515.96 --> 2517.14]  Right?
[2517.18 --> 2522.00]  He's not talking about some capacity you might, you think that you might have or don't have.
[2522.20 --> 2526.86]  He's talking about your present circumstances, your situation.
[2527.60 --> 2530.92]  If you are married, you have the gift of marriage.
[2531.44 --> 2535.38]  If you are single, you have the gift of singleness.
[2536.04 --> 2536.44]  Right?
[2536.50 --> 2543.90]  So it's the status, the situation, not our subjective feelings to how well we match the situation that we're in.
[2543.90 --> 2548.14]  And friends, also, our situations can change.
[2548.74 --> 2552.22]  If you're single, you can desire to be married.
[2552.36 --> 2552.48]  Right?
[2552.52 --> 2553.98]  That's a good desire.
[2554.14 --> 2555.70]  You can pray to God for that.
[2556.50 --> 2557.76]  You can ask God for that.
[2558.24 --> 2561.90]  If you're married, you can...
[2563.02 --> 2568.96]  Well, one day, you may be in a situation where you're single again, as we've said.
[2569.18 --> 2569.32]  Right?
[2569.32 --> 2574.12]  And so, we have different gifts at different times.
[2574.82 --> 2576.02]  And friends, that's great news.
[2576.88 --> 2584.64]  Because it means that whether we're married or we're single, whether we are happy or unhappy in that situation that we're in,
[2584.92 --> 2587.48]  either way, we get the goodness of God.
[2588.06 --> 2588.38]  Right?
[2588.42 --> 2590.02]  We receive his blessing.
[2590.14 --> 2590.90]  It is a gift.
[2591.26 --> 2593.34]  Either way, God is generous to us.
[2593.34 --> 2597.40]  So now, Paul continues in verses 8 and 9.
[2597.50 --> 2600.58]  And I really want to look at this before we move on to the next point.
[2601.62 --> 2602.24]  Paul says,
[2602.64 --> 2604.64]  Now to the unmarried and the widows I say,
[2605.14 --> 2607.30]  It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.
[2607.86 --> 2610.42]  But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.
[2610.52 --> 2613.64]  For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[2614.44 --> 2620.60]  You know, I had a cheeky friend who put this on the front of their marriage bulletin.
[2620.60 --> 2622.80]  It is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[2623.60 --> 2624.38]  That's a good one.
[2624.72 --> 2624.88]  Okay.
[2626.12 --> 2632.02]  But look, we don't misunderstand what Paul is saying when he talks about this burning with passion.
[2632.94 --> 2639.06]  You know, a lot of times, this is misinterpreted to mean if you have any sexual longings whatsoever,
[2639.06 --> 2641.90]  it must mean that God is calling you to marry.
[2641.90 --> 2649.64]  And the danger is that with this misconception is that people can get themselves into some unbiblical relationships
[2649.64 --> 2650.78]  because they say,
[2650.94 --> 2652.56]  Well, you know, I have these sexual longings.
[2652.70 --> 2655.06]  Therefore, this seems to be the only option.
[2655.80 --> 2659.20]  And friends, God is never going to put ourselves into that kind of a situation
[2659.20 --> 2660.56]  where he says,
[2660.70 --> 2661.98]  Well, you have sexual longings.
[2662.06 --> 2666.48]  Therefore, just ignore everything else I've said about marriage and sexuality.
[2666.84 --> 2668.56]  That's not what God is doing here.
[2668.56 --> 2677.04]  The context is that Paul is writing to a pagan Roman culture that, frankly, had very few sexual taboos.
[2678.04 --> 2683.06]  So when someone in that culture where sex was quite free,
[2683.16 --> 2688.18]  if you remember last week, you know, the word even Corinthian or to Corinthian eyes
[2688.18 --> 2690.60]  is another slang word for to fornicate.
[2690.86 --> 2692.24]  That's the culture they lived in.
[2692.42 --> 2694.86]  Now, when someone comes out of that culture and becomes a Christian,
[2695.42 --> 2697.56]  they don't know any other lifestyle.
[2697.56 --> 2700.96]  This is a whole new way of life and they have to learn.
[2701.80 --> 2702.64]  So Paul is saying,
[2703.08 --> 2704.58]  If you are going to be sexually active,
[2704.72 --> 2708.98]  there is one holy context that pleases God for that.
[2709.26 --> 2710.40]  And it's called marriage.
[2711.00 --> 2712.32]  And that's all he's saying.
[2713.14 --> 2719.58]  So God is calling you either to exercise self-control in sexual celibacy
[2719.58 --> 2721.26]  or to get married.
[2721.26 --> 2725.16]  And both are good gifts from God.
[2725.16 --> 2725.56]  Okay.
[2725.62 --> 2726.32]  God is good.
[2726.96 --> 2729.84]  In whatever situation that we are in,
[2730.32 --> 2733.24]  what we know is that God loves us
[2733.24 --> 2738.60]  and that this is God's good plan for you with this gift that he has given you right now.
[2738.60 --> 2744.02]  So that is the gift of singleness.
[2744.34 --> 2746.38]  And that leads us to the second point,
[2746.46 --> 2747.84]  which is, well, if this is a gift,
[2748.48 --> 2749.50]  what is this gift for?
[2750.42 --> 2750.62]  Right?
[2750.62 --> 2751.96]  What's the gift of singleness for?
[2753.34 --> 2757.44]  Now, the word gift is actually the Greek word charisma,
[2758.00 --> 2762.40]  which is the same word for spiritual gifts that Paul talks about elsewhere in this letter.
[2762.40 --> 2765.30]  So what are spiritual gifts?
[2766.22 --> 2770.02]  They're gifts of grace given to us for the benefit of others.
[2770.82 --> 2771.92]  That's what a spiritual gift is.
[2771.96 --> 2773.70]  It's a gift of grace, comes from God,
[2774.00 --> 2777.00]  given to us for the benefit of others,
[2777.02 --> 2779.92]  to serve the body of Christ and to build it up.
[2780.86 --> 2782.66]  And that's also what the gift of singleness is.
[2783.20 --> 2783.34]  Right?
[2783.36 --> 2784.32]  And that's what Paul says here.
[2784.56 --> 2788.22]  I want to read again verses 32 through 35,
[2788.42 --> 2789.36]  a bit of a longer section.
[2790.26 --> 2791.20]  This is what he says.
[2791.20 --> 2793.34]  I would like you to be free from concern.
[2794.74 --> 2795.48]  Isn't that great?
[2796.20 --> 2797.78]  Paul wants us to be free from concern.
[2799.04 --> 2803.24]  He says an unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,
[2803.58 --> 2805.08]  how he can please the Lord.
[2805.30 --> 2808.88]  But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world,
[2809.00 --> 2810.10]  how he can please his wife,
[2810.56 --> 2811.76]  and his interests are divided.
[2813.46 --> 2817.22]  An unmarried woman, or virgin, it's the same thing, young woman,
[2817.72 --> 2819.70]  is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[2819.70 --> 2822.82]  Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit.
[2823.28 --> 2825.80]  But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world,
[2825.88 --> 2826.98]  how she can please her husband.
[2827.60 --> 2829.94]  I'm saying this for your own good, and not to restrict you,
[2830.50 --> 2832.38]  but that you may live in a right way,
[2832.58 --> 2834.38]  in undivided devotion to the Lord.
[2834.38 --> 2838.28]  Now, first, Paul is not saying that if you are married,
[2838.36 --> 2840.20]  that you are somehow spiritually compromised.
[2841.64 --> 2843.54]  He's not saying that marriage is bad.
[2844.18 --> 2847.58]  In Ephesians 5, if you want to know what Paul says about marriage,
[2847.70 --> 2852.16]  he has this amazing picture of Christ's love for his church
[2852.16 --> 2856.18]  as being reflected in the relationship, the marriage of a man and a woman.
[2856.18 --> 2859.28]  And this is this glorious picture of the gospel.
[2859.44 --> 2860.84]  Like, Paul is big on marriage.
[2861.94 --> 2864.66]  But here, he's just being practical.
[2865.60 --> 2865.74]  Right?
[2865.84 --> 2870.64]  If you are unmarried, your devotion to the Lord is a bit more straightforward.
[2871.88 --> 2874.72]  Those of us who are single are typically,
[2875.22 --> 2877.56]  we're just not pulled in as many directions
[2877.56 --> 2880.52]  than those of us who are married.
[2880.52 --> 2885.28]  Those of us who are married are rightly divided.
[2885.48 --> 2885.54]  Right?
[2885.66 --> 2889.62]  God calls for us to care for our spouse,
[2889.76 --> 2891.20]  to care for our families.
[2892.04 --> 2894.02]  But Paul is saying, for those of us who are single,
[2894.14 --> 2896.48]  there's a sense in which we can serve the Lord
[2896.48 --> 2899.28]  in a way that is more undivided.
[2900.38 --> 2901.88]  You know, and throughout history,
[2902.56 --> 2906.04]  God has given us so many examples of men and women
[2906.04 --> 2908.10]  who have served him in singleness.
[2908.10 --> 2911.64]  And, you know, we could go all the way back to the beginning,
[2911.84 --> 2915.40]  Paul, and to St. Augustine and Jerome
[2915.40 --> 2918.46]  and Christosom in the early church.
[2918.74 --> 2920.30]  And we can just keep going on.
[2920.68 --> 2923.14]  And I want to just highlight, though, a little bit more recently,
[2923.76 --> 2925.34]  two women missionaries.
[2925.90 --> 2927.66]  So we think of Amy Carmichael.
[2928.16 --> 2930.14]  She was, we have our photo.
[2931.64 --> 2932.30]  Is it there?
[2932.46 --> 2932.92]  Oh, it is there.
[2932.98 --> 2933.74]  Sorry, I can't see it.
[2934.32 --> 2936.98]  So Amy Carmichael was an Irish missionary
[2936.98 --> 2939.36]  who worked with girls and women in India,
[2939.94 --> 2941.78]  saving them from temple prostitution.
[2942.50 --> 2945.68]  She served in India as a single woman for 55 years.
[2946.62 --> 2950.02]  All right, just devoted her life to God's kingdom.
[2951.30 --> 2954.02]  Another missionary is Gladys Aylward,
[2954.82 --> 2958.40]  who felt a call to mission in China.
[2958.60 --> 2960.54]  She founded an orphanage
[2960.54 --> 2963.86]  and just served Christ for most,
[2964.26 --> 2966.52]  I think all of her life or most of her life
[2966.52 --> 2969.58]  until she got very sick as a single woman.
[2971.20 --> 2973.20]  You know, we think of John Stott,
[2973.62 --> 2974.90]  Time Magazine named,
[2974.96 --> 2976.14]  like, one of the most influential,
[2976.64 --> 2978.06]  top 100 influential people.
[2978.44 --> 2980.70]  His whole life, he was a single man.
[2981.06 --> 2982.58]  He wrote tons of books.
[2983.08 --> 2984.66]  He traveled all around the world,
[2984.82 --> 2985.94]  strengthening the church.
[2985.94 --> 2989.40]  I love this one story about him
[2989.40 --> 2991.22]  where he was at a conference,
[2991.34 --> 2992.22]  I think in Argentina,
[2992.48 --> 2994.20]  and he was staying with this,
[2994.24 --> 2996.70]  you know, well-known theologian from Argentina.
[2997.56 --> 2999.88]  And they came into this house,
[2999.94 --> 3000.86]  it was a rainy day,
[3000.92 --> 3001.80]  it was rainstorms,
[3001.80 --> 3002.38]  it was muddy.
[3003.18 --> 3003.86]  And, you know,
[3003.88 --> 3007.02]  all of these pastors for this training conference
[3007.02 --> 3008.26]  had all their shoes there.
[3008.72 --> 3010.32]  And John Stott, he wakes up early,
[3011.02 --> 3011.64]  and what does he do?
[3012.20 --> 3014.28]  He just cleans their shoes, right?
[3014.28 --> 3015.86]  He just scrapes all the mud off their shoes.
[3016.86 --> 3016.98]  Right?
[3017.02 --> 3018.68]  He's such a servant, right?
[3018.72 --> 3020.00]  Serving God in the kingdom.
[3021.90 --> 3023.44]  So for those of us who are single,
[3024.56 --> 3026.18]  you know, it's very easy for us,
[3026.26 --> 3027.36]  you know, in our modern culture
[3027.36 --> 3028.38]  to think of our singleness
[3028.38 --> 3032.64]  as undivided devotion for ourselves, right?
[3032.74 --> 3033.88]  I'm free to do what I want,
[3034.26 --> 3035.48]  when I want, how I want.
[3036.36 --> 3038.10]  But we're reminded in God's word
[3038.10 --> 3039.76]  that if we have that flexibility
[3039.76 --> 3040.98]  as people who are single,
[3041.36 --> 3043.92]  that flexibility is not for our own sake,
[3044.28 --> 3045.68]  it's for the Lord's sake.
[3047.44 --> 3049.48]  Matt Smithhurst,
[3050.48 --> 3052.14]  he had an article on singleness,
[3052.32 --> 3053.14]  and this is what he said.
[3053.78 --> 3055.72]  The world champions the single life
[3055.72 --> 3057.58]  because of all you can do for yourself.
[3058.54 --> 3060.60]  The Bible champions the single life
[3060.60 --> 3062.46]  because of all you can do for others.
[3063.72 --> 3063.92]  Right?
[3063.92 --> 3064.86]  I think that's very powerful.
[3066.08 --> 3066.90]  You know, because,
[3067.04 --> 3068.22]  think about marriage and singleness.
[3068.22 --> 3068.94]  Marriage,
[3069.22 --> 3071.78]  it's a picture of the depth
[3071.78 --> 3073.84]  of Christ's love for the church
[3073.84 --> 3076.32]  because we can serve
[3076.32 --> 3078.16]  and sacrifice for one person.
[3079.54 --> 3081.74]  Singleness is a picture
[3081.74 --> 3084.32]  of the breadth of God's love
[3084.32 --> 3085.48]  for the church
[3085.48 --> 3086.96]  by serving and sacrificing
[3086.96 --> 3087.98]  for the many.
[3087.98 --> 3091.16]  And that's why Paul says,
[3091.28 --> 3093.26]  I wish all of you were like me
[3093.26 --> 3095.00]  because he has this heart
[3095.00 --> 3096.90]  for the kingdom of God
[3096.90 --> 3099.02]  and the gospel to go forth.
[3099.68 --> 3100.54]  He wants the gospel
[3100.54 --> 3101.76]  to go all around the world
[3101.76 --> 3103.82]  and singles, he knows,
[3103.90 --> 3105.06]  can be at the forefront
[3105.06 --> 3106.62]  of God's mission
[3106.62 --> 3107.64]  of taking the gospel
[3107.64 --> 3108.48]  into the world.
[3108.98 --> 3109.94]  And singles in a church
[3109.94 --> 3110.86]  can be at the forefront
[3110.86 --> 3112.64]  of leading us as a congregation
[3112.64 --> 3115.06]  into mission in our city.
[3115.06 --> 3116.76]  They can be at the forefront
[3116.76 --> 3118.70]  of caring for the body
[3118.70 --> 3121.62]  because it is a gift
[3121.62 --> 3122.36]  for the kingdom.
[3123.50 --> 3123.94]  Right?
[3124.00 --> 3124.98]  And friends, life is short.
[3125.64 --> 3126.64]  Life is but a vapor.
[3127.38 --> 3128.60]  And then we are with the Lord.
[3128.72 --> 3129.74]  And so in this time
[3129.74 --> 3130.66]  that we have,
[3131.18 --> 3132.56]  how do you want to serve
[3132.56 --> 3133.62]  in this brief moment?
[3134.26 --> 3135.20]  Is it going to be serving
[3135.20 --> 3135.66]  in marriage
[3135.66 --> 3137.26]  or is it going to be serving
[3137.26 --> 3137.92]  in singleness?
[3139.96 --> 3141.30]  And that brings us to
[3141.30 --> 3142.74]  the hope of singleness.
[3145.06 --> 3146.92]  Should God call you
[3146.92 --> 3148.20]  at some point in life
[3148.20 --> 3149.60]  to singleness,
[3150.18 --> 3152.26]  there is grace for you
[3152.26 --> 3152.88]  in this calling.
[3154.18 --> 3154.30]  Right?
[3154.38 --> 3157.32]  God has always had a plan
[3157.32 --> 3158.58]  to bless and honor
[3158.58 --> 3160.58]  those who do not marry.
[3161.80 --> 3163.06]  In Isaiah 56,
[3163.34 --> 3165.54]  God speaks to the eunuch.
[3166.32 --> 3167.46]  And a eunuch is someone
[3167.46 --> 3168.34]  who can't have children.
[3169.02 --> 3170.14]  And so this is what it says,
[3170.22 --> 3171.12]  verses 3 to 5.
[3172.32 --> 3173.06]  God says,
[3173.06 --> 3173.76]  let no,
[3174.36 --> 3175.68]  oh, here's translated
[3175.68 --> 3176.48]  foreigner, sorry.
[3176.90 --> 3177.66]  In the NIV it's foreigner.
[3177.74 --> 3178.82]  Other translations it's eunuch.
[3179.12 --> 3179.82]  Let no,
[3180.42 --> 3181.56]  I don't know why
[3181.56 --> 3182.30]  it says foreigner though.
[3182.92 --> 3183.62]  Let no foreigner
[3183.62 --> 3184.74]  who is bound to the Lord
[3184.74 --> 3185.16]  say,
[3185.52 --> 3186.58]  the Lord will surely
[3186.58 --> 3187.96]  exclude me from his people.
[3188.24 --> 3188.90]  Okay, there's eunuch.
[3189.30 --> 3190.80]  Let no eunuch complain,
[3191.44 --> 3192.74]  I am only a dry tree.
[3193.98 --> 3194.70]  For this is what
[3194.70 --> 3195.58]  the Lord says,
[3195.74 --> 3196.68]  to the eunuchs
[3196.68 --> 3198.16]  who keep my Sabbath,
[3198.98 --> 3200.52]  who choose what pleases me
[3200.52 --> 3201.96]  and hold fast to my covenant.
[3203.24 --> 3204.78]  To them I will give them
[3204.78 --> 3205.78]  within my temple
[3205.78 --> 3206.44]  and its walls
[3206.44 --> 3207.20]  a memorial
[3207.20 --> 3208.66]  and a name
[3208.66 --> 3210.42]  better than sons and daughters.
[3211.08 --> 3211.90]  I will give them
[3211.90 --> 3213.36]  an everlasting name
[3213.36 --> 3214.94]  that will endure forever.
[3216.32 --> 3217.10]  You see,
[3217.48 --> 3219.30]  the people of Israel
[3219.30 --> 3221.00]  were formed
[3221.00 --> 3223.16]  out of a promise to Abraham
[3223.16 --> 3224.72]  that he would be
[3224.72 --> 3226.28]  the father of a great nation.
[3227.14 --> 3227.42]  Right?
[3227.42 --> 3228.70]  And that he would have
[3228.70 --> 3229.80]  descendants like
[3229.80 --> 3231.04]  the stars of the sky.
[3232.44 --> 3233.56]  And that promise
[3233.56 --> 3234.72]  was to be passed on
[3234.72 --> 3236.50]  from one generation
[3236.50 --> 3237.18]  to the next
[3237.18 --> 3238.14]  through having children.
[3239.10 --> 3240.08]  And just as
[3240.08 --> 3241.64]  in other traditional societies,
[3241.90 --> 3242.50]  one's identity
[3242.50 --> 3243.26]  and one's honor
[3243.26 --> 3244.76]  was found in being able
[3244.76 --> 3245.52]  to bear children
[3245.52 --> 3246.78]  and to pass on your name
[3246.78 --> 3248.60]  to then become part
[3248.60 --> 3249.40]  of this great family.
[3250.42 --> 3251.52]  And the thing was,
[3251.68 --> 3252.18]  eunuchs
[3252.18 --> 3254.08]  were excluded from that,
[3254.12 --> 3254.50]  weren't they?
[3255.06 --> 3255.28]  Right?
[3255.28 --> 3256.84]  They couldn't pass on
[3256.84 --> 3258.20]  their name.
[3258.50 --> 3259.40]  They couldn't share
[3259.40 --> 3260.20]  in this blessing
[3260.20 --> 3260.96]  of the family
[3260.96 --> 3262.72]  that God was making.
[3263.58 --> 3264.36]  They were like
[3264.36 --> 3265.20]  a dry tree.
[3266.24 --> 3267.82]  But now God says to them,
[3267.94 --> 3269.54]  in the light of Jesus coming,
[3270.02 --> 3271.66]  for those who trust him
[3271.66 --> 3273.44]  and make him their God,
[3273.72 --> 3275.22]  you have a status change.
[3276.12 --> 3276.68]  And it's not just
[3276.68 --> 3278.06]  a Facebook status change.
[3278.58 --> 3279.16]  He says,
[3279.28 --> 3280.76]  you're not a dry tree.
[3281.02 --> 3282.10]  You're not abandoned
[3282.10 --> 3283.24]  to a life of loneliness.
[3283.46 --> 3283.76]  Instead,
[3283.76 --> 3285.20]  you have a name.
[3286.16 --> 3287.84]  And it's an everlasting name
[3287.84 --> 3288.66]  and a place
[3288.66 --> 3290.22]  in God's kingdom.
[3290.38 --> 3291.30]  You are part
[3291.30 --> 3292.70]  of this great family
[3292.70 --> 3294.66]  that God is building.
[3296.08 --> 3296.32]  You know,
[3296.38 --> 3297.10]  when we think about
[3297.10 --> 3297.62]  our houses,
[3297.90 --> 3298.04]  you know,
[3298.06 --> 3298.72]  maybe some place
[3298.72 --> 3299.22]  in your house
[3299.22 --> 3299.98]  you have pictures
[3299.98 --> 3300.62]  of your children
[3300.62 --> 3302.30]  or you have photos
[3302.30 --> 3303.38]  of your grandchildren.
[3304.22 --> 3305.10]  And when people
[3305.10 --> 3305.80]  come to visit,
[3306.02 --> 3306.78]  we often say,
[3306.92 --> 3307.08]  you know,
[3307.14 --> 3307.56]  hey, look,
[3307.62 --> 3308.86]  this is my son
[3308.86 --> 3309.88]  or this is my granddaughter.
[3310.28 --> 3311.12]  Isn't she wonderful?
[3311.12 --> 3311.44]  Right?
[3312.52 --> 3314.00]  We have pride
[3314.00 --> 3315.08]  and honor in that.
[3315.84 --> 3316.44]  And what God
[3316.44 --> 3317.12]  is saying here
[3317.12 --> 3319.42]  is that in God's family,
[3319.62 --> 3320.86]  on God's wall,
[3321.12 --> 3322.10]  there is a picture
[3322.10 --> 3322.76]  of you
[3322.76 --> 3323.84]  if you are single.
[3324.48 --> 3325.24]  And he says,
[3325.36 --> 3326.36]  it's more honor
[3326.36 --> 3327.64]  than sons and daughters
[3327.64 --> 3328.58]  because you have been
[3328.58 --> 3329.66]  bought by the blood
[3329.66 --> 3330.20]  of Christ.
[3330.46 --> 3331.56]  And you are now part
[3331.56 --> 3332.56]  of God's family tree.
[3332.86 --> 3334.36]  And God takes great delight
[3334.36 --> 3336.82]  in boasting about you.
[3336.86 --> 3337.60]  And he is honored
[3337.60 --> 3338.30]  by you.
[3340.74 --> 3341.24]  And you know,
[3341.34 --> 3341.92]  you know what, friends?
[3342.90 --> 3344.16]  The trajectory
[3344.16 --> 3347.22]  of every single one of us
[3347.22 --> 3350.18]  is that where we are headed
[3350.18 --> 3351.26]  one day
[3351.26 --> 3352.62]  is singleness.
[3355.92 --> 3357.02]  The Jewish leaders
[3357.02 --> 3358.30]  were trying to trap Jesus,
[3358.52 --> 3358.62]  right?
[3358.66 --> 3359.58]  They gave him a puzzle
[3359.58 --> 3361.26]  about the woman
[3361.26 --> 3362.28]  who had seven husbands
[3362.28 --> 3363.24]  who all died
[3363.24 --> 3364.72]  in the resurrection.
[3365.06 --> 3366.50]  Which one will she be married to?
[3366.50 --> 3369.12]  And Jesus responds,
[3369.28 --> 3369.40]  you know,
[3369.46 --> 3370.08]  you don't understand
[3370.08 --> 3370.74]  the power of God
[3370.74 --> 3371.30]  or the scriptures
[3371.30 --> 3373.46]  because at the resurrection,
[3373.98 --> 3374.64]  Jesus says,
[3375.02 --> 3376.62]  there will neither be marriage
[3376.62 --> 3378.56]  nor giving in marriage.
[3379.18 --> 3380.54]  You will be like the angels.
[3381.12 --> 3381.28]  You know,
[3381.32 --> 3382.12]  and then we took that
[3382.12 --> 3383.02]  and now we think angels,
[3383.14 --> 3383.92]  we're all going to have wings.
[3384.16 --> 3384.92]  That's not the point.
[3386.08 --> 3387.10]  Angels don't get married.
[3387.36 --> 3388.30]  We're going to be like that.
[3388.62 --> 3389.48]  We're not going to be married
[3389.48 --> 3389.86]  in heaven.
[3391.06 --> 3391.50]  Why?
[3392.46 --> 3394.42]  Because the real marriage
[3394.42 --> 3396.14]  that our earthly marriages
[3396.14 --> 3396.90]  point to
[3396.90 --> 3397.44]  is the marriage
[3397.44 --> 3398.40]  between Jesus Christ
[3398.40 --> 3399.18]  and his church.
[3399.36 --> 3401.28]  That's the real marriage.
[3402.26 --> 3402.94]  And so your marriage
[3402.94 --> 3403.90]  is not meant
[3403.90 --> 3405.10]  to fulfill you.
[3405.70 --> 3407.00]  It's meant to point
[3407.00 --> 3407.90]  to something
[3407.90 --> 3409.64]  that can fulfill you,
[3410.14 --> 3411.02]  being known and loved
[3411.02 --> 3411.92]  by Jesus Christ.
[3412.92 --> 3414.08]  So for those of us
[3414.08 --> 3414.52]  who are called
[3414.52 --> 3415.72]  the singleness now,
[3416.20 --> 3417.44]  it is a way
[3417.44 --> 3419.38]  to both anticipate
[3419.38 --> 3420.24]  that reality
[3420.24 --> 3422.08]  and to testify
[3422.08 --> 3423.44]  to its goodness.
[3423.44 --> 3425.70]  it's a way of saying
[3425.70 --> 3427.38]  that this is so,
[3427.96 --> 3429.78]  our relationship
[3429.78 --> 3430.38]  with Christ,
[3430.46 --> 3431.02]  being known
[3431.02 --> 3431.90]  and loved by him
[3431.90 --> 3432.98]  is so good
[3432.98 --> 3434.26]  and is so real
[3434.26 --> 3435.56]  that I can live
[3435.56 --> 3436.18]  according
[3436.18 --> 3438.06]  to that future hope
[3438.06 --> 3439.00]  right now.
[3439.54 --> 3440.94]  I can live in this life
[3440.94 --> 3442.08]  how all of us
[3442.08 --> 3442.92]  will be
[3442.92 --> 3443.92]  then.
[3445.08 --> 3445.84]  And to be single
[3445.84 --> 3446.62]  now in this life
[3446.62 --> 3447.40]  is to testify
[3447.40 --> 3448.88]  to a world
[3448.88 --> 3450.32]  that is so obsessed
[3450.32 --> 3452.10]  with sex
[3452.10 --> 3453.12]  and relationships
[3453.12 --> 3453.96]  and romance
[3453.96 --> 3454.98]  that Jesus
[3454.98 --> 3457.02]  is enough.
[3459.82 --> 3461.52]  That these things,
[3462.10 --> 3462.96]  the marriage
[3462.96 --> 3464.18]  and romantic relationships
[3464.18 --> 3464.84]  in this life
[3464.84 --> 3465.66]  is not ultimate
[3465.66 --> 3467.06]  but that in Christ
[3467.06 --> 3467.92]  we have the thing
[3467.92 --> 3469.36]  that is ultimate.
[3470.52 --> 3470.70]  You know,
[3470.76 --> 3471.12]  one day,
[3471.22 --> 3471.96]  whether you are single
[3471.96 --> 3472.56]  or married,
[3472.72 --> 3473.78]  all of your
[3473.78 --> 3475.36]  unmet longings
[3475.36 --> 3477.80]  and when you're single
[3477.80 --> 3478.38]  you have those
[3478.38 --> 3478.98]  unmet longings.
[3479.06 --> 3479.60]  When you're married,
[3479.60 --> 3480.50]  you often have
[3480.50 --> 3481.46]  those unmet longings.
[3482.62 --> 3483.42]  All of them
[3483.42 --> 3484.06]  will ultimately
[3484.06 --> 3484.76]  be fulfilled
[3484.76 --> 3485.32]  in the one
[3485.32 --> 3486.10]  who is our
[3486.10 --> 3486.80]  ultimate husband.
[3487.68 --> 3487.88]  Right?
[3487.92 --> 3488.50]  The ultimate
[3488.50 --> 3489.46]  bridegroom
[3489.46 --> 3491.24]  that we long for
[3491.24 --> 3492.84]  most in our hearts
[3492.84 --> 3493.34]  and that is
[3493.34 --> 3494.36]  the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3495.66 --> 3495.82]  Okay,
[3495.82 --> 3496.68]  so let me pray for us.
[3499.84 --> 3500.32]  Father,
[3500.38 --> 3500.82]  we thank you
[3500.82 --> 3502.20]  for this,
[3502.32 --> 3502.92]  the gift
[3502.92 --> 3503.58]  of singleness.
[3505.02 --> 3505.48]  Lord,
[3505.54 --> 3506.70]  I pray for all of us
[3506.70 --> 3507.46]  here
[3507.46 --> 3509.14]  who are single
[3509.14 --> 3510.78]  Lord,
[3510.86 --> 3511.28]  that maybe
[3511.28 --> 3511.98]  they would
[3511.98 --> 3512.66]  see
[3512.66 --> 3513.82]  more
[3513.82 --> 3514.38]  of what
[3514.38 --> 3514.80]  your heart
[3514.80 --> 3515.42]  is for them.
[3516.92 --> 3517.36]  Lord,
[3517.44 --> 3518.28]  for all of us
[3518.28 --> 3519.56]  who are married,
[3519.82 --> 3520.22]  help us
[3520.22 --> 3521.90]  to love
[3521.90 --> 3522.46]  and to see
[3522.46 --> 3523.06]  the good
[3523.06 --> 3524.26]  of singleness
[3524.26 --> 3525.78]  and Lord,
[3525.86 --> 3526.50]  help all of us
[3526.50 --> 3527.10]  as a church
[3527.10 --> 3527.96]  to live out
[3527.96 --> 3528.72]  this calling
[3528.72 --> 3530.62]  of being married
[3530.62 --> 3531.30]  or being single,
[3531.38 --> 3531.92]  whatever you have
[3531.92 --> 3532.52]  called us to,
[3532.66 --> 3532.80]  Lord,
[3533.18 --> 3533.82]  to be faithful
[3533.82 --> 3534.68]  to you in it
[3534.68 --> 3535.82]  and ultimately
[3535.82 --> 3536.62]  to serve you
[3536.62 --> 3537.38]  and look forward
[3537.38 --> 3538.40]  to the marriage
[3538.40 --> 3539.16]  that we will all
[3539.16 --> 3540.04]  have one day
[3540.04 --> 3541.78]  of being united
[3541.78 --> 3542.74]  to our Lord
[3542.74 --> 3543.16]  and Savior,
[3543.34 --> 3543.90]  Jesus Christ.
[3545.10 --> 3545.54]  Lord,
[3546.00 --> 3547.22]  we thank you
[3547.22 --> 3547.84]  for your word.
[3548.14 --> 3548.66]  We know that
[3548.66 --> 3550.06]  you give it to us
[3550.06 --> 3550.96]  because you love us.
[3551.60 --> 3552.60]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3552.92 --> 3553.14]  Amen.
[3556.20 --> 3557.68]  So let's all rise,
[3557.76 --> 3558.28]  let's stand,
[3558.60 --> 3559.20]  and let's sing
[3559.20 --> 3559.94]  our song of response
[3559.94 --> 3560.24]  together.
[3560.24 --> 3560.30]  Amen.
[3560.30 --> 3560.36]  Amen.
[3560.36 --> 3560.38]  Amen.
[3560.38 --> 3560.42]  Amen.
[3560.42 --> 3560.44]  Amen.
[3560.44 --> 3560.46]  Amen.
[3560.46 --> 3560.50]  Amen.
[3560.50 --> 3560.52]  Amen.
[3560.52 --> 3560.54]  Amen.
[3564.68 --> 3585.88]  In Christ alone
[3585.88 --> 3588.78]  my hope is found
[3588.78 --> 3590.72]  He is my light,
[3590.82 --> 3592.40]  my strength,
[3592.54 --> 3593.90]  my song
[3593.90 --> 3596.64]  this cornerstone,
[3596.64 --> 3599.48]  this solid ground,
[3599.48 --> 3601.56]  firm through the fiercest
[3601.56 --> 3604.24]  drought and storm.
[3604.78 --> 3607.16]  What hands of love,
[3607.28 --> 3609.32]  what hands of peace,
[3609.68 --> 3611.96]  when fears are still,
[3612.12 --> 3614.06]  when strivings cease,
[3614.60 --> 3616.32]  my comforter,
[3617.22 --> 3619.64]  my all in all,
[3620.12 --> 3623.16]  here in the love of Christ
[3623.16 --> 3624.16]  I stand.
[3624.16 --> 3624.94]  I stand.
[3633.94 --> 3636.54]  In Christ alone,
[3636.54 --> 3639.60]  who took on flesh,
[3639.60 --> 3641.40]  fullness of God
[3641.40 --> 3644.38]  in helpless way,
[3644.82 --> 3647.20]  this gift of love
[3647.20 --> 3648.90]  and righteousness,
[3648.90 --> 3651.70]  scorned by the ones
[3651.70 --> 3654.72]  He came to save.
[3654.72 --> 3657.80]  Till on the cross
[3657.80 --> 3659.86]  Jesus died,
[3660.28 --> 3662.68]  the wrath of God
[3662.68 --> 3664.38]  was satisfied,
[3665.22 --> 3667.68]  for every sin
[3667.68 --> 3670.50]  on Him was laid,
[3670.94 --> 3672.22]  here in the death
[3672.22 --> 3675.64]  of Christ I live.
[3675.64 --> 3687.68]  there in the ground
[3687.68 --> 3690.38]  His body lay,
[3690.38 --> 3692.12]  light of the world
[3692.12 --> 3694.38]  by darkness slain,
[3695.38 --> 3697.38]  then bursting forth
[3697.90 --> 3699.38]  in glorious day,
[3700.80 --> 3702.02]  up from the grave
[3702.02 --> 3704.38]  He rose again,
[3704.38 --> 3707.60]  and as He stands
[3707.60 --> 3709.08]  in victory,
[3709.94 --> 3711.38]  sin's curse has lost
[3712.22 --> 3714.18]  His grip on me,
[3714.66 --> 3716.88]  for I am His
[3716.88 --> 3719.64]  and He is mine,
[3720.06 --> 3721.38]  bought with the precious
[3721.38 --> 3724.72]  blood of Christ.
[3724.72 --> 3736.06]  No guilt in life,
[3736.06 --> 3738.80]  no fear in death,
[3739.00 --> 3740.44]  this is the power
[3740.44 --> 3743.24]  of Christ in me.
[3743.50 --> 3745.94]  From life's first cry
[3745.94 --> 3748.06]  to final breath,
[3749.02 --> 3752.34]  Jesus commands my destiny,
[3752.34 --> 3755.34]  no power of hell,
[3755.34 --> 3757.34]  no human plan,
[3757.34 --> 3760.34]  can ever block me
[3761.22 --> 3762.34]  from His hand,
[3763.44 --> 3765.66]  till He returns,
[3766.06 --> 3767.34]  or calls me home,
[3768.92 --> 3770.28]  here in the power
[3770.28 --> 3773.34]  of Christ I stand.
[3773.34 --> 3787.88]  Let's come before the Lord
[3787.88 --> 3788.88]  in prayer
[3788.88 --> 3790.18]  for
[3790.18 --> 3792.82]  the things on our hearts,
[3793.18 --> 3793.94]  especially, you know,
[3793.98 --> 3794.94]  we have this list
[3794.94 --> 3796.34]  of some prayer requests,
[3796.42 --> 3797.20]  things going on
[3797.20 --> 3798.00]  in our own community
[3798.00 --> 3798.78]  that you can always
[3798.78 --> 3799.96]  take home and pray with.
[3800.54 --> 3801.34]  Let's pray for some
[3801.34 --> 3801.74]  of those things
[3801.74 --> 3802.42]  right now together.
[3802.62 --> 3802.94]  Let's pray.
[3803.34 --> 3805.98]  Father, we thank you
[3805.98 --> 3807.78]  for this song
[3807.78 --> 3808.62]  that we just sang
[3808.62 --> 3810.66]  that reminds us
[3810.66 --> 3814.12]  that we belong to you,
[3814.48 --> 3815.88]  that you are ours
[3815.88 --> 3818.12]  and we are yours,
[3818.60 --> 3820.30]  and that you have purchased us
[3820.30 --> 3821.88]  by the blood of Christ,
[3821.96 --> 3823.12]  that we belong to you.
[3823.72 --> 3824.56]  Father, we thank you
[3824.56 --> 3825.52]  for the great hope
[3825.52 --> 3826.78]  that we have.
[3826.86 --> 3827.34]  Lord, we thank you
[3827.34 --> 3829.50]  for your grace to us,
[3830.10 --> 3831.92]  that we have
[3831.92 --> 3833.14]  an everlasting name
[3833.14 --> 3834.62]  with you in heaven.
[3836.82 --> 3838.38]  Father, we also lift up
[3838.38 --> 3840.48]  the concerns, though,
[3840.56 --> 3842.58]  of those in our church community
[3842.58 --> 3844.34]  and also the joys
[3844.34 --> 3845.84]  of many in our community.
[3846.56 --> 3847.54]  Father, today,
[3847.90 --> 3850.34]  we pray and thank you
[3850.34 --> 3851.30]  for the great joy
[3851.30 --> 3854.66]  of baby Grace,
[3855.06 --> 3856.76]  who was born to Kukuya
[3856.76 --> 3857.50]  and Salaam,
[3858.06 --> 3858.62]  this Monday.
[3859.12 --> 3859.72]  Lord, we thank you
[3859.72 --> 3860.34]  for the birth
[3860.34 --> 3861.16]  of a healthy girl.
[3862.24 --> 3862.82]  Lord, we thank you
[3862.82 --> 3864.72]  for the great gift
[3864.72 --> 3865.50]  that she is
[3865.50 --> 3866.22]  and the grace
[3866.22 --> 3867.58]  that she is.
[3868.04 --> 3869.38]  Lord, I love that name,
[3869.48 --> 3869.82]  Grace.
[3870.60 --> 3871.98]  Lord, would she also
[3871.98 --> 3873.04]  grow up to know
[3873.04 --> 3873.78]  and experience
[3873.78 --> 3874.74]  your grace to her.
[3876.08 --> 3877.22]  Lord, we pray for
[3877.22 --> 3878.32]  Michaela and Jason,
[3878.48 --> 3879.42]  and as they are
[3879.42 --> 3880.70]  expecting a baby,
[3880.90 --> 3881.98]  Lord, we pray that
[3881.98 --> 3884.40]  you would grow that baby
[3884.40 --> 3885.30]  in a healthy way,
[3885.62 --> 3886.68]  even in the womb,
[3886.98 --> 3887.84]  that you would protect
[3887.84 --> 3888.72]  this child.
[3889.68 --> 3890.96]  And, Lord, we look forward
[3890.96 --> 3891.86]  also to welcoming
[3891.86 --> 3893.16]  him or her
[3893.16 --> 3894.34]  into the world
[3894.34 --> 3895.54]  and into our church family.
[3896.04 --> 3897.32]  Lord, be with Jason
[3897.32 --> 3897.80]  and Michaela
[3897.80 --> 3898.48]  as they go through
[3898.48 --> 3900.70]  this transition
[3900.70 --> 3901.84]  and experience
[3901.84 --> 3903.26]  this wonderful gift
[3903.26 --> 3903.66]  as well.
[3905.56 --> 3906.54]  Lord, we thank you
[3906.54 --> 3908.88]  also for that
[3908.88 --> 3911.48]  Peter and Kara
[3911.48 --> 3912.72]  and their family
[3912.72 --> 3913.56]  have come back
[3913.56 --> 3914.54]  with their new adopted
[3914.54 --> 3915.84]  son, Ezra,
[3916.34 --> 3917.68]  that you have provided
[3917.68 --> 3920.04]  the passport
[3920.04 --> 3922.06]  and the documentation
[3922.06 --> 3922.92]  that they need
[3922.92 --> 3923.56]  and that they have
[3923.56 --> 3924.56]  safely arrived at home.
[3925.36 --> 3926.22]  Lord, we thank you
[3926.22 --> 3928.14]  for this great adventure
[3928.14 --> 3929.12]  that they went on,
[3929.46 --> 3930.34]  and, Lord, we thank you
[3930.34 --> 3931.52]  for also this new child
[3931.52 --> 3932.84]  that's just a reminder
[3932.84 --> 3934.10]  and adoption
[3934.10 --> 3936.38]  of how you have adopted us,
[3936.86 --> 3939.02]  that we were even
[3939.02 --> 3940.32]  outside the family of God,
[3940.38 --> 3942.30]  but you have brought us in
[3942.30 --> 3943.56]  through Christ
[3943.56 --> 3944.66]  and adopted us
[3944.66 --> 3945.80]  as your own
[3945.80 --> 3946.50]  that we become
[3946.50 --> 3947.62]  sons and daughters
[3947.62 --> 3948.64]  of our Heavenly Father.
[3950.40 --> 3951.52]  Father, we also continue
[3951.52 --> 3952.42]  to pray for those
[3952.42 --> 3954.30]  who are struggling
[3954.30 --> 3956.00]  with pain and illness.
[3956.16 --> 3956.98]  Lord, I lift up Shirley
[3956.98 --> 3957.52]  to you
[3957.52 --> 3958.46]  who often still
[3958.46 --> 3959.82]  struggles with
[3959.82 --> 3961.64]  ongoing pain.
[3962.64 --> 3964.10]  Lord, we pray for Doug
[3964.10 --> 3966.74]  in his diagnosis
[3966.74 --> 3967.50]  of cancer.
[3968.30 --> 3969.26]  Lord, we pray
[3969.26 --> 3970.70]  that you would
[3970.70 --> 3972.46]  use the treatments
[3972.46 --> 3974.08]  that he will be taking
[3974.08 --> 3974.82]  in the coming week
[3974.82 --> 3975.58]  or two, Lord,
[3975.68 --> 3978.16]  to heal his body
[3978.16 --> 3978.80]  of this cancer,
[3979.16 --> 3980.02]  that you would remove it
[3980.02 --> 3980.44]  from him
[3980.44 --> 3981.12]  and give him
[3981.12 --> 3983.16]  just a restored health.
[3985.04 --> 3986.78]  Lord, for all of these
[3986.78 --> 3988.26]  needs that we have
[3988.26 --> 3988.92]  as a community
[3988.92 --> 3990.86]  and for many more.
[3991.04 --> 3992.02]  Lord, we just ask
[3992.02 --> 3993.28]  also that you would
[3993.28 --> 3995.88]  revitalize us
[3995.88 --> 3996.50]  as a church.
[3997.16 --> 3997.78]  We pray
[3997.78 --> 4001.98]  for a spirit
[4001.98 --> 4004.56]  of trust in you,
[4005.40 --> 4006.66]  a spirit of service
[4006.66 --> 4007.44]  to you
[4007.44 --> 4008.90]  and to the body.
[4009.54 --> 4010.16]  Lord, we pray
[4010.16 --> 4010.56]  that you would
[4010.56 --> 4011.48]  strengthen us
[4011.48 --> 4012.26]  in grace,
[4012.92 --> 4014.02]  that we would live out
[4014.02 --> 4014.58]  the gospel
[4014.58 --> 4016.04]  in our lives
[4016.04 --> 4016.68]  as a church.
[4017.18 --> 4017.74]  Lord, help us
[4017.74 --> 4019.24]  to invite others
[4019.24 --> 4019.84]  to come in,
[4019.92 --> 4021.36]  people who we've known
[4021.36 --> 4022.54]  and we can welcome
[4022.54 --> 4023.48]  them to join us
[4023.48 --> 4024.58]  to know and worship you
[4024.58 --> 4025.34]  on Sunday morning.
[4027.32 --> 4028.40]  Lord, would you continue
[4028.40 --> 4029.24]  to be at work
[4029.24 --> 4030.78]  in this body?
[4031.42 --> 4032.22]  Would your spirit
[4032.22 --> 4033.40]  be powerfully at work?
[4033.48 --> 4034.14]  Would you do amazing
[4034.14 --> 4035.12]  things among us?
[4036.14 --> 4036.86]  Lord, we pray
[4036.86 --> 4038.00]  for all of these things
[4038.00 --> 4038.40]  we mentioned.
[4038.54 --> 4039.80]  We pray for all those things
[4039.80 --> 4040.96]  that are still
[4040.96 --> 4041.92]  on our hearts
[4041.92 --> 4043.06]  that were not said
[4043.06 --> 4043.78]  just now.
[4044.60 --> 4044.94]  But Lord,
[4044.98 --> 4045.38]  all of them,
[4045.44 --> 4046.26]  we lift them up
[4046.26 --> 4047.90]  to the throne
[4047.90 --> 4048.40]  of grace.
[4048.60 --> 4049.58]  All of the needs
[4049.58 --> 4050.38]  that we have.
[4050.80 --> 4051.54]  All of the people
[4051.54 --> 4052.34]  who we love
[4052.34 --> 4053.32]  and are part of this body
[4053.32 --> 4054.06]  and that we care for
[4054.06 --> 4054.42]  as well.
[4055.14 --> 4056.02]  Lord, we pray
[4056.02 --> 4057.20]  in Jesus' name.
[4057.66 --> 4057.96]  Amen.
[4059.64 --> 4060.44]  Would you stand
[4060.44 --> 4061.20]  one last time?
[4063.48 --> 4064.08]  Right now,
[4064.32 --> 4064.78]  I invite you
[4064.78 --> 4066.02]  to hold out your hands
[4066.02 --> 4066.96]  as a gesture
[4066.96 --> 4067.54]  of receiving
[4067.54 --> 4069.00]  God's benediction.
[4069.78 --> 4070.34]  May the Lord
[4070.34 --> 4071.12]  bless you
[4071.12 --> 4072.28]  and keep you.
[4072.88 --> 4073.32]  May the Lord
[4073.32 --> 4074.08]  turn his face
[4074.08 --> 4074.80]  toward you
[4074.80 --> 4075.52]  and be gracious
[4075.52 --> 4076.06]  to you.
[4076.44 --> 4077.36]  And may the Lord
