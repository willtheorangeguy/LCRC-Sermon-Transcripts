[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 271.00] Amen.
[271.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[272.00 → 274.00] Amen.
[274.00 → 276.00] Amen.
[276.00 → 277.00] Amen.
[277.00 → 279.00] Amen.
[279.00 → 280.00] Amen.
[280.00 → 282.00] Good morning.
[282.00 → 284.00] Good morning.
[284.00 → 285.00] Good morning.
[285.00 → 286.00] Wow.
[287.00 → 291.00] That was great.
[291.00 → 296.00] So welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church, and if you are new with us today we especially
[296.00 → 297.00] welcome you.
[297.00 → 302.66] My name is Jason True, and I will be leading us through our worship service this morning.
[303.12 → 306.10] And I want to mention a couple of things before we begin.
[307.16 → 308.60] So this is a bit new.
[309.90 → 311.56] It's great to see you all.
[312.28 → 316.32] I also want to just kind of mention a few things.
[316.52 → 325.08] One is masks are not required, but if you are not yet fully vaccinated, you may still
[325.08 → 325.90] wish to wear them.
[325.90 → 329.34] You may still wish to wear them even if you are fully vaccinated.
[329.72 → 335.18] And so we're all kind of at different places with our comfort level and what's going on.
[335.24 → 336.96] And so this will be kind of a transitional period.
[337.26 → 338.38] So feel free to wear masks.
[338.50 → 339.16] Feel free not to.
[339.94 → 341.16] The same way with distancing.
[341.94 → 346.96] If you want to be distanced, feel free to scoot away from people, and we won't think you're
[346.96 → 348.92] being rude or anything like that.
[348.94 → 349.42] It's okay.
[350.62 → 352.44] So let's respect each other's wishes.
[352.44 → 356.06] Maybe not necessarily reach out for a handshake.
[357.02 → 359.76] Just allow people some time to get used to things.
[360.44 → 363.74] After the service, you will not be dismissed by the ushers.
[363.90 → 366.96] You may feel free to kind of get up and go out.
[367.04 → 369.92] We will not yet be having our juice and buns in the fellowship hall.
[369.92 → 375.10] But do feel free to gather, to fellowship, to chat outside or inside.
[375.10 → 383.08] Also, our children are now back with us for the first part of the worship service.
[383.16 → 387.82] And so we will be dismissing them to go to their Sunday school classes before the sermon.
[390.16 → 390.70] And let's see.
[391.24 → 393.72] Marian Mandrel asked me to make this announcement.
[394.08 → 398.52] She is now in charge of our hospital singing at Mountain View.
[398.52 → 400.74] And that is actually going to start next Sunday.
[401.34 → 406.68] Okay, so next Sunday, anyone who wants to participate, we are going to go after our worship service
[406.68 → 408.90] to Mountain View and sing.
[409.38 → 411.84] And so we'll also make an announcement about that next Sunday.
[413.62 → 418.72] Today, our designated offering is a new ministry that we are supporting.
[418.94 → 423.92] It is called the Vancouver Short-Term Mission Training Centre.
[424.20 → 424.84] It's kind of a mouthful.
[425.20 → 427.42] It's the Vancouver Short-Term Mission Training Centre.
[427.42 → 433.34] This is a large ministry in Vancouver that works largely with Chinese churches.
[433.76 → 439.00] And because of our Chinese ministry, Pastor Nancy has been partnering with them.
[439.86 → 441.06] And they have been here.
[441.20 → 443.60] They have helped us think about outreach.
[444.04 → 446.30] And they will be continuing to work with us.
[446.78 → 453.84] And so we wanted to also show our support for their ministry by giving and supporting them financially.
[453.84 → 462.18] And so would you now please, if you don't mind, and if you are able, would you stand?
[462.98 → 470.72] And let's join each other in the Lord's gracious invitation to worship Him from Psalm 86.
[471.26 → 473.16] And we'll say this responsibly.
[473.26 → 474.26] Where it says, leader, I will lead.
[474.32 → 476.30] Where it says, family, I'll ask you to read aloud.
[476.30 → 482.30] We will praise you, O Lord, our God, with our whole hearts.
[482.90 → 485.02] We will glorify your name forever.
[485.30 → 488.56] For you have delivered us from the power of death.
[489.74 → 492.64] Bring joy to your servants, O Lord.
[492.64 → 495.72] For to you, we lift our souls.
[496.22 → 497.96] There is none like you.
[497.96 → 501.08] No deeds can compare with yours.
[502.20 → 507.30] All the nations you have made will come and worship before you.
[507.70 → 509.62] They will bring glory to your name.
[510.02 → 511.96] For you alone are God.
[513.38 → 515.98] Teach us now your way, O Lord.
[516.52 → 518.60] And we will live in your truth.
[519.36 → 525.00] Give us undivided hearts that we may fear and praise your great name.
[526.04 → 527.32] Would you join me in prayer?
[527.96 → 534.32] Gracious Father, we come to you this morning because you are who you say you are.
[535.32 → 538.48] You are the faithful and true one.
[538.64 → 543.36] The God of all grace who is able to make grace abound to us in all times.
[544.36 → 547.12] Lord Jesus, lover of our souls.
[548.30 → 551.20] Holy Spirit, our comforter and counsellor.
[552.08 → 555.90] By your grace, would you now inhabit our praises.
[555.90 → 558.38] Lift your hearts.
[559.06 → 559.96] Lift our hearts.
[560.08 → 561.60] Lift our heads.
[562.38 → 565.24] Even as we now lift high the name of Jesus.
[565.66 → 567.72] The name above every name in which we pray.
[568.40 → 570.46] The seed who crushed the serpent's head.
[571.02 → 572.10] The alpha and the omega.
[573.08 → 573.40] Amen.
[574.84 → 576.48] And here is our greeting this morning.
[576.48 → 579.86] From Jude chapter 1.
[579.86 → 585.58] To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ.
[586.18 → 590.74] Mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[590.74 → 599.64] And now as our Father has greeted us, why don't we turn to greet one another, greet those around us.
[600.32 → 602.22] And then we will lift our hearts in worship together.
[602.22 → 603.18] order.
[603.18 → 603.98] Thank you very much.
[604.10 → 604.62] I hope it's Valera.
[604.62 → 605.20] Thank you very much.
[605.20 → 605.78] Hear that hear.
[605.78 → 606.10] Amen.
[606.70 → 607.38] Gather.

[756.94 → 758.94] Thank you.
[758.94 → 760.94] Thank you.
[760.94 → 762.94] Thank you.
[762.94 → 766.12] Christ is risen
[766.12 → 772.94] Bow down before Him
[773.50 → 777.94] For He is Lord of God
[778.80 → 780.94] Sing hallelujah
[781.70 → 784.94] Christ is risen
[784.94 → 794.74] O come to the altar
[794.74 → 800.12] The Father's arms are open wide
[800.12 → 804.92] Forgiveness was blown with
[804.92 → 810.80] The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[814.94 → 824.94] Pay your crosses as you wait for the crown
[824.94 → 829.94] Tell the world of a treasure you found
[829.94 → 831.94] Glenda
[831.94 → 832.94] Understand
[832.94 → 833.94] Amen
[833.94 → 835.94] Amen
[835.94 → 836.94] Amen
[837.94 → 839.94] Amen
[839.94 → 841.94] Amen
[842.94 → 844.94] Amen
[844.94 → 845.94] Father
[845.94 → 846.94] Amen
[846.94 → 850.44] On the
[850.44 → 851.94] Youth
[851.94 → 852.94] Man
[852.94 → 853.94] Aging
[853.94 → 875.04] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
[875.04 → 885.34] O my soul, praise and glory is your help and salvation.
[886.92 → 894.78] From all who hear, brothers and sisters, draw near.
[895.36 → 900.54] Join me in glad adoration.
[900.54 → 911.82] Praise to the Lord, the Lord, the things of the cross, the reigning.
[912.90 → 921.96] Shall turn you on to his feet, so gentle, just standing.
[921.96 → 937.84] Have you not seen all that is needful has been sent by his gracious ordaining?
[937.84 → 950.04] Praise to the Lord, the Lord, the nations in the adoring.
[950.04 → 961.04] God has life and earth, one loving gracious before him.
[961.04 → 971.04] Let the Amen sound from his people again.
[971.04 → 978.84] And live forever, adore him.
[991.04 → 1014.56] How great the chasm that lay between us.
[1014.56 → 1020.56] How hard the mountain I could not climb.
[1021.72 → 1034.56] In desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[1034.56 → 1064.54] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1064.56 → 1072.56] Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[1072.56 → 1079.96] What heart could fathom such well-less grace?
[1079.96 → 1086.50] The God of ages stepped down from glory
[1086.50 → 1094.50] To wear my sin and pain and pain and pain.
[1094.50 → 1100.50] The cross has spoken, I am forgiven.
[1100.50 → 1107.50] The King of kings calls me his Lord.
[1107.50 → 1117.50] Beautiful Saviour, my Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Son of God.
[1117.50 → 1119.50] My living hope.
[1119.50 → 1120.50] My living hope.
[1120.50 → 1121.50] Hallelujah.
[1121.50 → 1122.50] Hallelujah.
[1122.50 → 1124.50] Praise the one who set me free.
[1124.50 → 1125.50] Hallelujah.
[1125.50 → 1128.50] Praise the one who set me free.
[1128.50 → 1129.50] Hallelujah.
[1129.50 → 1134.50] Death has lost its grip on me.
[1134.50 → 1135.50] You have broken every chain.
[1135.50 → 1136.50] There's salvation in your name.
[1136.50 → 1149.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1149.50 → 1162.50] Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[1162.50 → 1164.50] Your buried body began to breathe.
[1164.50 → 1178.62] Out of the silence, the roaring lion, declared the grave has no claim on me.
[1178.62 → 1193.30] Then came the morning that sealed the promise, your buried body began to ring.
[1193.30 → 1206.16] Out of the silence, the roaring lion, declared the grave has no claim on me.
[1206.16 → 1212.20] Jesus Christ, yours has victory.
[1212.20 → 1221.16] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1221.16 → 1228.00] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1228.00 → 1234.84] You have broken and retained, there's salvation in your name.
[1234.84 → 1240.88] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1244.14 → 1248.48] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1250.88 → 1255.36] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1255.36 → 1262.20] You have broken and retained, there's salvation in your name.
[1262.20 → 1267.86] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1267.86 → 1274.36] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1274.36 → 1277.66] My new hope.
[1277.66 → 1282.36] My living hope.
[1282.36 → 1282.80] Amen.
[1289.30 → 1302.34] So one thing about gospel worship is gospel worship is not just bringing the best of our singing,
[1302.34 → 1310.04] the best of our hearts or our fellowship, but it's actually bringing the worst.
[1311.52 → 1317.64] It's bringing the worst of who we are, the worst of what we have done.
[1318.32 → 1324.82] And when we bring our worst honestly to God, that's worship.
[1324.82 → 1332.58] Right, bringing our worst to God is an act of worship because we're looking and trusting
[1332.58 → 1340.66] in the only source who is gracious enough to forgive us and accept us through Jesus Christ
[1340.66 → 1345.66] and then to set us free from the power of sin and death.
[1347.02 → 1352.70] And so we come now to this time of confession, and so let us lay our hearts before the Lord
[1352.70 → 1358.58] and confess the worst of ourselves to God our Saviour.
[1360.82 → 1366.70] So let's turn our hearts and our eyes to the words that we'll have on the screen,
[1367.02 → 1370.12] and let's make this our confession together.
[1370.28 → 1371.48] Would you pray with me?
[1372.26 → 1381.92] O Lord, great God, all holy, Father most gracious, filled with mercy and steadfast love,
[1382.70 → 1385.32] we are embarrassed to come before you.
[1386.32 → 1390.78] For we have preferred the ways of this world to your ways.
[1391.40 → 1397.30] For we have rebelled against your wisdom, and we have gotten into trouble.
[1397.30 → 1404.78] For we have rejected your fatherly guidance and have gotten lost altogether.
[1404.78 → 1417.98] O Lord, great God, all holy, Father most gracious, filled with mercy and steadfast love, incline your ear to our troubles.
[1419.08 → 1422.90] Hear us when we pour out our sorrows before you.
[1422.90 → 1431.66] Forgive us, not on the ground of our own righteousness, but on the ground of your great mercy.
[1432.32 → 1439.16] On the ground of your great mercy, in the gift of your Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1439.86 → 1442.50] It is in his name that we pray.
[1443.18 → 1443.60] Amen.
[1443.60 → 1449.54] So I want to invite you to take this moment of silence in our worship service.
[1449.66 → 1455.66] Come before the Lord in your own heart with all the worst things, the shame that you bear,
[1456.10 → 1458.20] and come before him because he loves you.
[1458.20 → 1458.30] Amen.
[1458.30 → 1458.38] Amen.
[1473.60 → 1493.24] Our Heavenly Father, sometimes we are told that we live in a cancel culture.
[1493.24 → 1504.86] But when we come here before you on Sunday morning, we are reminded that what is cancelled is the debt of our sin.
[1507.32 → 1513.84] So, Father, we rejoice that we can freely come before you, not because of our own righteousness,
[1514.68 → 1519.70] but because of the righteousness of your Son, who stood in our place and died for us.
[1519.70 → 1526.94] So, Father, we pray that you would enable us to cast off the sin that entangles us,
[1527.42 → 1534.12] to lay down the shame that we bear at the foot of the cross and underneath the wounded feet of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1535.20 → 1540.34] And, Lord, in freedom to know our status as beloved sons and daughters,
[1541.04 → 1543.94] and that we would now worship you in spirit and in truth.
[1544.10 → 1545.26] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1545.72 → 1546.02] Amen.
[1546.02 → 1546.12] Amen.
[1546.12 → 1546.16] Amen.
[1548.32 → 1551.96] Hear these words of grace, these words of assurance from 1 John.
[1552.92 → 1557.24] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[1557.78 → 1567.00] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[1567.92 → 1568.98] Thanks be to God.
[1570.08 → 1575.28] Would you stand again, and let's sing a song of response and renewal together.
[1575.28 → 1576.12] Let's sing a song of applause.
[1576.12 → 1577.02] Let's sing a song of.
[1577.02 → 1577.82] Let's sing a song of.
[1577.82 → 1577.98] Be to God and joy.
[1592.08 → 1596.36] How can we wash away my sin?
[1596.70 → 1600.00] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1600.00 → 1604.56] What can make me whole again
[1604.56 → 1608.22] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1608.22 → 1613.04] Oh, precious as the flow
[1613.04 → 1617.08] That makes me white as snow
[1617.08 → 1621.44] No other fount I know
[1621.44 → 1625.20] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1630.00 → 1634.42] For my bottom this I see
[1634.42 → 1638.14] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1638.14 → 1642.86] For my cleansing this my plea
[1642.86 → 1647.14] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1647.14 → 1651.54] Oh, precious as the flow
[1651.54 → 1655.72] That makes me white as snow
[1655.72 → 1660.14] No other fount I know
[1660.14 → 1664.18] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1664.18 → 1673.46] Nothing can force it at all
[1673.46 → 1677.34] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1677.34 → 1682.06] Not of good that I have done
[1682.06 → 1686.06] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1686.06 → 1690.62] Oh, precious as the flow
[1690.62 → 1694.96] That makes me white as snow
[1694.96 → 1699.34] No other fount I know
[1699.34 → 1703.34] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1703.34 → 1713.16] This is all my hope and peace
[1713.16 → 1716.76] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1716.76 → 1721.10] This is all my righteousness
[1721.10 → 1725.52] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1725.52 → 1730.30] Oh, precious as the flow
[1730.30 → 1730.32] Oh, precious as the flow
[1730.32 → 1734.66] That makes me white as snow
[1734.66 → 1739.28] No other fount I know
[1739.28 → 1743.58] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1743.58 → 1760.68] So the children
[1760.68 → 1762.98] You are now dismissed
[1762.98 → 1765.40] To go to your Sunday school classes
[1765.40 → 1767.16] So go ahead
[1767.16 → 1782.16] And as the kids go
[1782.16 → 1793.38] Sorry, I am actually having
[1793.38 → 1796.50] The same problem I had two weeks ago
[1796.50 → 1800.38] Here we go
[1800.38 → 1801.86] Alright, great
[1801.86 → 1802.58] Sorry about that
[1802.58 → 1806.96] So we are in a sermon series this summer
[1806.96 → 1809.86] On the Psalms of Ascent
[1809.86 → 1810.28] Right?
[1810.36 → 1812.12] The Psalms are a beautiful book in the Bible
[1812.12 → 1813.88] And the Psalms of Ascent
[1813.88 → 1816.04] Are a small collection in the Psalter
[1816.04 → 1819.52] From Psalm 120 through Psalm 134
[1819.52 → 1821.40] And we're calling this series
[1821.40 → 1822.98] Songs for the Journey
[1822.98 → 1824.44] And the reason is
[1824.44 → 1827.52] Is because the Psalms were sung
[1827.52 → 1829.20] And these Psalms in particular
[1829.20 → 1830.24] The Psalms of Ascent
[1830.24 → 1831.76] Would have been sung
[1831.76 → 1833.04] As God's people
[1833.04 → 1835.28] Made a pilgrimage
[1835.28 → 1836.94] To Jerusalem
[1836.94 → 1838.34] To worship God
[1838.34 → 1839.08] They would do this
[1839.08 → 1841.36] Two or three times a year
[1841.36 → 1845.32] And so many of these Psalms of Ascent
[1845.32 → 1847.86] Have this setting in mind
[1847.86 → 1849.12] Of going up to Jerusalem
[1849.12 → 1850.74] Of going to the temple
[1850.74 → 1851.64] To Mount Zion
[1851.64 → 1853.78] But the Psalm
[1853.78 → 1855.50] That we're going to be looking at today
[1855.50 → 1856.78] Is different
[1856.78 → 1859.66] Jerusalem isn't mentioned
[1859.66 → 1862.18] Worship at the temple
[1862.18 → 1863.50] Isn't mentioned
[1863.50 → 1865.56] What it is
[1865.56 → 1867.68] Is a simple lament
[1867.68 → 1869.46] It's a lament
[1869.46 → 1871.52] And it's an invitation
[1871.52 → 1874.62] To look up to our Heavenly Father
[1874.62 → 1877.34] And ask Him to show us mercy
[1877.34 → 1879.82] So listen to Psalm 123
[1879.82 → 1881.62] As I read it for us
[1881.62 → 1883.72] A song of ascents
[1883.72 → 1886.04] I lift my eyes to you
[1886.04 → 1888.68] To you who sit enthroned in heaven
[1888.68 → 1891.92] As the eyes of slaves
[1891.92 → 1893.40] Look to the hand of their master
[1893.40 → 1895.74] As the eyes of a female slave
[1895.74 → 1897.48] Look to the hand of her mistress
[1897.48 → 1899.66] So our eyes
[1899.66 → 1902.14] Look to the Lord our God
[1902.14 → 1905.34] Till He shows us His mercy
[1905.34 → 1907.36] Have mercy on us Lord
[1907.36 → 1909.10] Have mercy on us
[1909.10 → 1910.76] For we have endured
[1910.76 → 1912.86] No end of contempt
[1912.86 → 1914.78] We have endured
[1914.78 → 1916.66] No end of ridicule
[1916.66 → 1918.32] From the arrogant
[1918.32 → 1919.98] Of contempt
[1919.98 → 1921.42] From the proud
[1921.42 → 1924.32] This is the word of the Lord
[1924.32 → 1926.08] Thanks be to God
[1926.08 → 1927.18] Let's pray
[1927.18 → 1930.66] Father we come
[1930.66 → 1933.12] Yet again before you this morning
[1933.12 → 1935.80] Asking that you would
[1935.80 → 1937.58] Show us who you are
[1937.58 → 1940.34] And we thank you for
[1940.34 → 1942.08] Your inspired
[1942.08 → 1944.04] Your authoritative
[1944.04 → 1946.20] Your infallible
[1946.20 → 1947.86] Word
[1947.86 → 1950.90] Without which we would be
[1950.90 → 1951.58] In the dark
[1951.58 → 1953.68] But Lord you have wanted
[1953.68 → 1956.18] To know us
[1956.18 → 1957.64] You have wanted us to know you
[1957.64 → 1959.40] To have a relationship with you
[1959.40 → 1960.60] And so you have
[1960.60 → 1962.68] Spoken to us
[1962.68 → 1964.30] Through the apostles
[1964.30 → 1965.14] Through the prophets
[1965.14 → 1966.88] And Lord we
[1966.88 → 1968.64] Want to see you
[1968.64 → 1969.48] This morning
[1969.48 → 1970.50] We want to know you
[1970.50 → 1971.64] And be known by you
[1971.64 → 1973.30] So Lord would you work
[1973.30 → 1974.02] In your hearts
[1974.02 → 1975.04] And be present with us
[1975.04 → 1975.84] By your Holy Spirit
[1975.84 → 1978.16] We pray in Jesus name
[1978.16 → 1978.72] Amen
[1978.72 → 1980.94] August 22
[1980.94 → 1982.52] 1964
[1982.52 → 1985.28] A poor Mississippi
[1985.28 → 1986.14] Sharecropper
[1986.14 → 1986.78] Turned
[1986.78 → 1988.28] Civil rights activist
[1988.28 → 1990.26] Named Fannie Lou Hammer
[1990.26 → 1992.24] Spoke at the Democratic
[1992.24 → 1993.54] National Convention
[1993.54 → 1995.02] In the United States
[1995.02 → 1996.38] In Atlantic City
[1996.38 → 1998.10] Hammer
[1998.10 → 2000.14] Before the convention
[2000.14 → 2002.12] Described in graphic detail
[2002.12 → 2004.02] A vicious
[2004.02 → 2005.28] Beating
[2005.28 → 2007.38] That she had suffered
[2007.38 → 2008.28] A year before
[2008.28 → 2010.06] In a Mississippi jailhouse
[2010.06 → 2010.80] That had
[2010.80 → 2012.34] Lifelong effects
[2012.34 → 2013.42] On her
[2013.42 → 2014.02] It left her
[2014.02 → 2014.70] With severe
[2014.70 → 2015.56] Kidney damage
[2015.56 → 2017.24] A blood clot
[2017.24 → 2018.28] Behind one eye
[2018.28 → 2018.96] And a permanent
[2018.96 → 2019.54] Limp
[2019.54 → 2022.38] And she revealed
[2022.38 → 2023.62] The demeaning
[2023.62 → 2024.78] Discrimination
[2024.78 → 2026.58] That had
[2026.58 → 2027.48] Long
[2027.48 → 2029.16] Crippled
[2029.16 → 2030.08] And oppressed
[2030.08 → 2031.64] The hopes
[2031.64 → 2032.54] And the dreams
[2032.54 → 2034.84] The voting rights
[2034.84 → 2036.46] The bodies
[2036.46 → 2037.96] Of black folks
[2037.96 → 2039.10] All across Mississippi
[2039.10 → 2040.76] She said
[2040.76 → 2041.88] Our lives
[2041.88 → 2042.76] Are threatened
[2042.76 → 2043.96] Daily
[2043.96 → 2045.64] Because we want
[2045.64 → 2046.10] To live
[2046.10 → 2046.96] As decent
[2046.96 → 2047.70] Human beings
[2047.70 → 2048.64] In America
[2048.64 → 2050.80] And so
[2050.80 → 2052.02] As a national
[2052.02 → 2053.70] Television audience
[2053.70 → 2055.22] Looked on
[2055.22 → 2055.80] And listened
[2055.80 → 2056.46] Intently
[2056.46 → 2057.96] She culminated
[2057.96 → 2058.50] Her speech
[2058.50 → 2058.86] With these
[2058.86 → 2059.56] Unforgettable
[2059.56 → 2060.00] Words
[2060.00 → 2060.74] Words you might
[2060.74 → 2061.70] Even know
[2061.70 → 2062.68] She said
[2062.68 → 2063.82] I am sick
[2063.82 → 2064.74] And tired
[2064.74 → 2066.38] Of being sick
[2066.38 → 2066.80] And tired
[2066.80 → 2069.64] And this
[2069.64 → 2069.96] Friends
[2069.96 → 2070.64] Is where
[2070.64 → 2071.62] This psalm
[2071.62 → 2072.62] Situates
[2072.62 → 2074.16] Our emotions
[2074.16 → 2075.98] Our thoughts
[2075.98 → 2076.72] And our
[2076.72 → 2077.66] Imagination
[2077.66 → 2078.14] This morning
[2078.14 → 2078.92] The psalmist
[2078.92 → 2079.74] Is saying
[2079.74 → 2081.50] In essence
[2081.50 → 2082.24] I am sick
[2082.24 → 2082.90] And tired
[2082.90 → 2083.64] Of being sick
[2083.64 → 2084.04] And tired
[2084.04 → 2085.80] Look at verse 3
[2085.80 → 2086.62] It says
[2086.62 → 2087.84] For we have
[2087.84 → 2088.42] Endured
[2088.42 → 2090.14] No end
[2090.14 → 2091.90] Of contempt
[2091.90 → 2094.12] We have
[2094.12 → 2094.50] Endured
[2094.50 → 2095.32] No end
[2095.32 → 2096.18] Of ridicule
[2096.18 → 2097.24] From the arrogant
[2097.24 → 2098.26] Of contempt
[2098.26 → 2099.24] From the proud
[2099.24 → 2101.16] Now what is
[2101.16 → 2101.72] What do we mean
[2101.72 → 2102.48] By contempt
[2102.48 → 2104.20] Contempt
[2104.20 → 2104.22] Contempt
[2104.22 → 2105.08] Is essentially
[2105.08 → 2107.18] Meeting someone
[2107.18 → 2108.80] And instead
[2108.80 → 2109.48] Of them meeting
[2109.48 → 2110.86] You face to face
[2110.86 → 2111.84] Instead they
[2111.84 → 2112.86] Look down
[2112.86 → 2113.48] On you
[2113.48 → 2114.24] Right
[2114.24 → 2114.80] They don't meet
[2114.80 → 2115.44] You as a person
[2115.44 → 2116.10] With equal
[2116.10 → 2116.90] Worth
[2116.90 → 2117.94] And dignity
[2117.94 → 2118.72] And value
[2118.72 → 2119.84] But look at
[2119.84 → 2120.38] You with
[2120.38 → 2121.34] Disgust
[2121.34 → 2122.54] And maybe fear
[2122.54 → 2123.92] Like you're
[2123.92 → 2124.60] Less than fully
[2124.60 → 2124.92] Human
[2124.92 → 2126.56] And this
[2126.56 → 2127.20] Is essentially
[2127.20 → 2127.92] The opposite
[2127.92 → 2129.22] Of love
[2129.22 → 2129.66] It's often
[2129.66 → 2130.08] Said that
[2130.08 → 2130.58] The opposite
[2130.58 → 2131.00] Of love
[2131.00 → 2131.40] Is not
[2131.40 → 2132.00] Hate
[2132.00 → 2133.30] But indifference
[2133.30 → 2134.72] Contempt
[2134.72 → 2135.84] Right
[2135.84 → 2136.42] That we show
[2136.42 → 2136.98] The ultimate
[2136.98 → 2137.74] Scorn
[2137.74 → 2138.46] Of another
[2138.46 → 2139.02] Person
[2139.02 → 2141.22] When you
[2141.22 → 2142.56] Are indifferent
[2142.56 → 2143.56] To their
[2143.56 → 2143.96] Needs
[2143.96 → 2144.74] To their
[2144.74 → 2145.46] Intrinsic
[2145.46 → 2145.94] Value
[2145.94 → 2147.36] Right
[2147.36 → 2147.82] And of course
[2147.82 → 2148.70] Not much
[2148.70 → 2149.20] Else
[2149.20 → 2150.04] Sticks in our
[2150.04 → 2150.42] Hearts
[2150.42 → 2151.88] And reverberates
[2151.88 → 2152.90] In our souls
[2152.90 → 2153.86] More than
[2153.86 → 2154.60] When we are
[2154.60 → 2154.84] Shown
[2154.84 → 2155.34] Contempt
[2155.34 → 2155.90] And scorn
[2155.90 → 2156.86] And the
[2156.86 → 2157.50] Psalmist is saying
[2157.50 → 2158.00] We have endured
[2158.00 → 2158.92] No end
[2158.92 → 2159.88] Of contempt
[2159.88 → 2160.76] God's people
[2160.76 → 2162.14] We're enduring
[2162.14 → 2163.44] Long-standing
[2163.44 → 2164.62] Deep-seated
[2164.62 → 2165.32] Oppression
[2165.32 → 2165.90] From their
[2165.90 → 2166.38] Neighbours
[2166.38 → 2167.18] Kind of throughout
[2167.18 → 2167.94] Their history
[2167.94 → 2168.76] As God's people
[2168.76 → 2169.84] And this has
[2169.84 → 2171.10] Troubled their
[2171.10 → 2171.84] Minds
[2171.84 → 2173.16] It has brought
[2173.16 → 2173.84] Them to the
[2173.84 → 2174.68] End of their
[2174.68 → 2175.28] Ropes
[2175.28 → 2176.32] And they are
[2176.32 → 2177.56] Calling out
[2177.56 → 2178.68] To the Lord
[2178.68 → 2179.38] For relief
[2179.38 → 2181.02] And the imagery
[2181.02 → 2181.82] Here is kind of
[2181.82 → 2183.30] Like a sponge
[2183.30 → 2184.46] That is just
[2184.46 → 2185.66] So saturated
[2185.66 → 2186.42] With water
[2186.42 → 2187.56] That it can't
[2187.56 → 2188.30] Absorb anymore
[2188.30 → 2189.38] It's full
[2189.38 → 2190.10] It's just leaking
[2190.10 → 2191.00] Out, and it's
[2191.00 → 2191.68] About to sink
[2191.68 → 2192.34] To the bottom
[2192.34 → 2193.44] You know
[2193.44 → 2194.64] For us
[2194.64 → 2195.86] I bet that
[2195.86 → 2196.36] Many of us
[2196.36 → 2196.84] Can relate
[2196.84 → 2197.62] To that feeling
[2197.62 → 2199.14] Many of us
[2199.14 → 2200.52] Have experienced
[2200.52 → 2201.64] Contempt
[2201.64 → 2203.24] Shown toward us
[2203.24 → 2204.36] Right
[2204.36 → 2205.46] Maybe you feel
[2205.46 → 2205.94] Like you know
[2205.94 → 2206.66] If I've got to
[2206.66 → 2207.44] Endure this
[2207.44 → 2208.46] Mistreatment
[2208.46 → 2210.16] One more time
[2210.16 → 2211.62] Whether from my
[2211.62 → 2212.60] Job or at
[2212.60 → 2213.50] Home or
[2213.50 → 2213.88] From my
[2213.88 → 2214.92] Neighbour or
[2214.92 → 2215.30] If I get
[2215.30 → 2216.00] Bullied one more
[2216.00 → 2216.66] Time I just
[2216.66 → 2217.16] Don't know what
[2217.16 → 2217.42] I'm going to
[2217.42 → 2218.22] Do I am
[2218.22 → 2219.08] Fed up
[2219.08 → 2221.30] But not only
[2221.30 → 2222.02] Do we experience
[2222.02 → 2222.68] This personally
[2222.68 → 2224.58] We see the
[2224.58 → 2225.34] Ugliness of
[2225.34 → 2225.94] Contempt
[2225.94 → 2226.72] In our
[2226.72 → 2227.20] Society
[2227.20 → 2228.44] Right
[2228.44 → 2229.64] On different
[2229.64 → 2230.86] Sides of
[2230.86 → 2231.78] Political or
[2231.78 → 2232.72] Social issues
[2232.72 → 2233.62] We treat
[2233.62 → 2234.34] Each other
[2234.34 → 2235.76] In such
[2235.76 → 2236.20] Very
[2236.20 → 2237.62] Disrespectful
[2237.62 → 2238.48] Scornful
[2238.48 → 2239.66] And dehumanizing
[2239.66 → 2240.16] Ways
[2240.16 → 2242.14] Of course
[2242.14 → 2242.56] We see
[2242.56 → 2243.26] Contempt
[2243.26 → 2244.42] On an
[2244.42 → 2245.46] Atrocious
[2245.46 → 2246.12] Level
[2246.12 → 2247.20] When entire
[2247.20 → 2247.88] Groups of
[2247.88 → 2248.52] People are
[2248.52 → 2249.30] Just cast
[2249.30 → 2249.98] Aside or
[2249.98 → 2250.68] Treated with
[2250.68 → 2251.22] Scorn
[2251.22 → 2252.12] And of course
[2252.12 → 2252.90] This has led
[2252.90 → 2253.56] To mass
[2253.56 → 2254.38] Atrocity
[2254.38 → 2255.70] That we've
[2255.70 → 2256.10] Seen throughout
[2256.10 → 2256.50] History
[2256.50 → 2258.60] You know
[2258.60 → 2258.86] And the
[2258.86 → 2259.44] Bible talks
[2259.44 → 2260.12] About contempt
[2260.12 → 2261.38] Contempt
[2261.38 → 2262.70] Is seen
[2262.70 → 2263.30] In scripture
[2263.30 → 2264.00] As worse
[2264.00 → 2264.50] Than hatred
[2264.50 → 2265.62] Or anger
[2265.62 → 2266.72] Right
[2266.72 → 2267.38] Think about
[2267.38 → 2267.78] The sermon
[2267.78 → 2268.20] On the mount
[2268.20 → 2268.72] Where Jesus
[2268.72 → 2269.38] Makes it
[2269.38 → 2270.24] Very clear
[2270.24 → 2271.02] That contempt
[2271.02 → 2271.80] Is worse
[2271.80 → 2272.62] Than murder
[2272.62 → 2274.22] He says
[2274.22 → 2274.24] He says
[2274.24 → 2274.62] You have
[2274.62 → 2275.06] He says
[2275.06 → 2275.62] You have
[2275.62 → 2275.66] Heard that it was said
[2275.66 → 2276.34] To the people
[2276.34 → 2276.90] Long ago
[2276.90 → 2277.58] You shall not
[2277.58 → 2277.90] Murder
[2277.90 → 2278.94] But anyone
[2278.94 → 2279.68] Who says
[2279.68 → 2280.52] You fool
[2280.52 → 2281.84] Will be
[2281.84 → 2282.44] Danger
[2282.44 → 2283.92] In danger
[2283.92 → 2284.54] Of the fire
[2284.54 → 2284.90] Of hell
[2284.90 → 2286.74] You fool
[2286.74 → 2288.06] Is to look
[2288.06 → 2288.74] On someone
[2288.74 → 2290.04] With contempt
[2290.04 → 2292.50] Jesus has
[2292.50 → 2293.60] No place
[2293.60 → 2295.00] For contempt
[2295.00 → 2295.76] In those
[2295.76 → 2296.48] Who follow
[2296.48 → 2297.02] A loving
[2297.02 → 2297.84] And merciful
[2297.84 → 2298.34] God
[2298.34 → 2298.92] Right
[2298.92 → 2299.58] And not only that
[2299.58 → 2300.18] But think about
[2300.18 → 2300.50] Jesus
[2300.50 → 2301.42] Jesus actually
[2301.42 → 2302.84] Sought to show
[2302.84 → 2303.44] Mercy
[2303.44 → 2304.66] And love
[2304.66 → 2305.88] To people
[2305.88 → 2306.32] Who
[2306.32 → 2308.14] Had been seen
[2308.14 → 2308.82] With contempt
[2308.82 → 2309.70] Right
[2309.70 → 2310.26] He sought
[2310.26 → 2311.34] After the lepers
[2311.34 → 2312.80] Those who were
[2312.80 → 2313.74] Unclean
[2313.74 → 2314.32] And marginalized
[2314.32 → 2315.70] He came to
[2315.70 → 2316.52] The outcast
[2316.52 → 2317.00] He came
[2317.00 → 2317.78] To women
[2317.78 → 2318.60] And children
[2318.60 → 2319.38] He came
[2319.38 → 2320.12] To the poor
[2320.12 → 2321.52] People who
[2321.52 → 2322.82] Were seen
[2322.82 → 2323.46] As less
[2323.46 → 2323.84] Than fully
[2323.84 → 2324.18] Human
[2324.18 → 2325.40] He came
[2325.40 → 2325.88] To the
[2325.88 → 2326.54] Samaritans
[2326.54 → 2326.82] Who were
[2326.82 → 2327.68] Despised
[2327.68 → 2328.46] By Israel
[2328.46 → 2330.16] And as
[2330.16 → 2330.68] Jesus
[2330.68 → 2332.14] Pursued them
[2332.14 → 2332.66] He gave
[2332.66 → 2333.36] Them dignity
[2333.36 → 2335.20] He saw
[2335.20 → 2335.80] Their intrinsic
[2335.80 → 2336.70] Value as
[2336.70 → 2337.38] Being human
[2337.38 → 2337.68] Beings
[2337.68 → 2338.06] Created
[2338.06 → 2338.40] In the
[2338.40 → 2338.76] Image
[2338.76 → 2339.34] Of God
[2339.34 → 2339.74] And he
[2339.74 → 2340.14] Sought to
[2340.14 → 2340.58] Redeem
[2340.58 → 2340.82] Them
[2340.82 → 2341.06] And in
[2341.06 → 2341.24] Doing
[2341.24 → 2341.62] That
[2341.62 → 2343.60] He
[2343.60 → 2344.06] They
[2344.06 → 2344.84] Responded
[2344.84 → 2345.70] To him
[2345.70 → 2346.44] By lifting
[2346.44 → 2347.02] Up their
[2347.02 → 2347.80] Eyes
[2347.80 → 2348.96] To Jesus
[2348.96 → 2350.48] And saying
[2350.48 → 2351.54] Have mercy
[2351.54 → 2352.02] On us
[2352.02 → 2352.26] Lord
[2352.26 → 2352.82] Have mercy
[2352.82 → 2353.38] On us
[2353.38 → 2355.04] That's what
[2355.04 → 2355.44] They cried
[2355.44 → 2355.94] To Jesus
[2355.94 → 2356.50] We see that
[2356.50 → 2356.86] All throughout
[2356.86 → 2357.46] The gospels
[2357.46 → 2359.46] And friends
[2359.46 → 2360.44] That is what
[2360.44 → 2360.94] This psalm
[2360.94 → 2361.40] Invites us
[2361.40 → 2361.66] To do
[2361.66 → 2361.98] As well
[2361.98 → 2365.00] It invites
[2365.00 → 2365.30] Us and
[2365.30 → 2365.72] It teaches
[2365.72 → 2366.52] Us how
[2366.52 → 2367.66] To lift
[2367.66 → 2368.52] Our eyes
[2368.52 → 2369.62] Toward
[2369.62 → 2370.36] A merciful
[2370.36 → 2371.24] And loving
[2371.24 → 2371.56] God
[2371.56 → 2373.34] The good
[2373.34 → 2373.72] News of
[2373.72 → 2374.18] This psalm
[2374.18 → 2374.48] Is that
[2374.48 → 2375.42] There is
[2375.42 → 2376.26] Favour
[2376.26 → 2376.90] For the
[2376.90 → 2377.30] Fed up
[2377.30 → 2378.14] There's
[2378.14 → 2378.44] Favour
[2378.44 → 2378.80] For the
[2378.80 → 2379.22] Fed up
[2379.22 → 2380.18] And we
[2380.18 → 2380.70] See God's
[2380.70 → 2381.08] Favour in
[2381.08 → 2381.56] This psalm
[2381.56 → 2382.00] In two
[2382.00 → 2382.32] Ways
[2382.32 → 2382.54] That I
[2382.54 → 2382.86] Want to
[2382.86 → 2383.40] I want to
[2383.40 → 2383.90] Point out
[2383.90 → 2384.36] To us
[2384.36 → 2385.20] That God
[2385.20 → 2385.62] Has
[2385.62 → 2386.48] He's got a
[2386.48 → 2387.32] Perspective
[2387.32 → 2387.96] For the
[2387.96 → 2388.36] Fed up
[2388.36 → 2389.04] That he
[2389.04 → 2389.42] Wants us
[2389.42 → 2389.78] To see
[2389.78 → 2390.62] And he's
[2390.62 → 2391.24] Got protection
[2391.24 → 2391.62] For the
[2391.62 → 2392.00] Fed up
[2392.00 → 2392.76] Those two
[2392.76 → 2393.12] Things
[2393.12 → 2394.58] So first
[2394.58 → 2395.46] God's got
[2395.46 → 2396.02] Protection
[2396.02 → 2396.78] Sorry
[2396.78 → 2397.48] God's got
[2397.48 → 2397.92] The first one
[2397.92 → 2398.58] Is God's got
[2398.58 → 2399.74] Perspective
[2399.74 → 2400.48] For the
[2400.48 → 2400.86] Fed up
[2400.86 → 2401.68] There it
[2401.68 → 2401.94] Is
[2401.94 → 2403.18] Notice in
[2403.18 → 2403.66] Verse 1
[2403.66 → 2404.26] It says
[2404.26 → 2405.52] I lift
[2405.52 → 2406.48] My eyes
[2406.48 → 2407.18] To you
[2407.18 → 2408.16] To you
[2408.16 → 2408.66] Who sat
[2408.66 → 2409.36] Enthroned
[2409.36 → 2409.76] In heaven
[2409.76 → 2410.96] Right
[2410.96 → 2411.62] So our text
[2411.62 → 2412.44] Begins with a
[2412.44 → 2413.00] Statement of
[2413.00 → 2413.48] God's
[2413.48 → 2414.20] Exalted
[2414.20 → 2415.32] Reign
[2415.32 → 2415.84] Right
[2415.84 → 2416.76] God being
[2416.76 → 2417.32] Above
[2417.32 → 2418.54] Everything
[2418.54 → 2419.14] Of him
[2419.14 → 2419.66] Ruling
[2419.66 → 2420.28] Over
[2420.28 → 2420.94] All
[2420.94 → 2421.42] Things
[2421.42 → 2422.46] Now think
[2422.46 → 2422.80] About that
[2422.80 → 2423.14] Why is
[2423.14 → 2423.44] That so
[2423.44 → 2423.84] Important
[2423.84 → 2424.72] It's
[2424.72 → 2425.10] Important
[2425.10 → 2425.48] Because
[2425.48 → 2426.04] People who
[2426.04 → 2426.42] Are at
[2426.42 → 2426.86] The bottom
[2426.86 → 2427.78] Desperately
[2427.78 → 2428.32] Need to
[2428.32 → 2428.82] Know that
[2428.82 → 2429.50] God is
[2429.50 → 2430.06] Higher
[2430.06 → 2430.54] Than
[2430.54 → 2431.02] Everything
[2431.02 → 2431.46] That is
[2431.46 → 2431.86] Higher
[2431.86 → 2432.40] Than
[2432.40 → 2432.86] They are
[2432.86 → 2434.14] Right
[2434.14 → 2434.52] We want
[2434.52 → 2434.94] To know
[2434.94 → 2435.40] That God
[2435.40 → 2436.02] Is greater
[2436.02 → 2436.46] Than our
[2436.46 → 2437.14] Oppressors
[2437.14 → 2438.20] That God
[2438.20 → 2438.90] Is bigger
[2438.90 → 2439.54] Than
[2439.54 → 2440.28] Everything
[2440.28 → 2440.84] That has
[2440.84 → 2441.26] Got us
[2441.26 → 2441.62] Down
[2441.62 → 2442.46] Right
[2442.46 → 2442.86] That God
[2442.86 → 2443.14] Is more
[2443.14 → 2443.96] Powerful
[2443.96 → 2444.62] Than the
[2444.62 → 2444.88] Bully
[2444.88 → 2446.48] Right
[2446.48 → 2447.00] Oppressed
[2447.00 → 2447.38] People
[2447.38 → 2448.00] Look up
[2448.00 → 2448.24] To
[2448.24 → 2449.30] The God
[2449.30 → 2450.30] Who is
[2450.30 → 2450.92] Unthrown
[2450.92 → 2451.80] Above all
[2451.80 → 2452.48] Worldly
[2452.48 → 2452.90] Powers
[2452.90 → 2453.62] All
[2453.62 → 2454.14] Systems
[2454.14 → 2454.76] Of oppression
[2454.76 → 2455.28] Where
[2455.28 → 2455.80] Everything
[2455.80 → 2456.56] Has been
[2456.56 → 2457.16] Put under
[2457.16 → 2458.06] His feet
[2458.06 → 2459.30] Why do
[2459.30 → 2459.62] We look
[2459.62 → 2459.86] Up to
[2459.86 → 2460.08] Him
[2460.08 → 2460.54] Is because
[2460.54 → 2461.40] We can't
[2461.40 → 2461.78] Help or
[2461.78 → 2461.94] Save
[2461.94 → 2462.46] Ourselves
[2462.46 → 2463.56] Right
[2463.56 → 2464.06] We can't
[2464.06 → 2464.76] Get out
[2464.76 → 2465.62] From under
[2465.62 → 2466.92] The oppression
[2466.92 → 2467.36] That has
[2467.36 → 2467.78] Pinned us
[2467.78 → 2468.06] Down
[2468.06 → 2468.24] Right
[2468.24 → 2468.50] Whether
[2468.50 → 2468.92] That's
[2468.92 → 2469.74] The contempt
[2469.74 → 2470.10] Of the
[2470.10 → 2470.44] World
[2470.44 → 2471.56] The contempt
[2471.56 → 2471.88] That we
[2471.88 → 2472.20] Just see
[2472.20 → 2472.78] Around us
[2472.78 → 2473.04] Or that
[2473.04 → 2473.38] Is directed
[2473.38 → 2473.66] Toward
[2473.66 → 2474.20] Ourselves
[2474.20 → 2474.88] Or the
[2474.88 → 2475.42] Oppression
[2475.42 → 2475.98] Of our
[2475.98 → 2476.18] Own
[2476.18 → 2476.56] Sin
[2476.56 → 2476.88] Maybe
[2476.88 → 2477.64] That we
[2477.64 → 2477.92] Feel
[2477.92 → 2478.56] Enslaved
[2478.56 → 2478.94] To
[2478.94 → 2480.72] We are
[2480.72 → 2481.50] Confined
[2481.50 → 2482.22] By our
[2482.22 → 2483.14] Powerlessness
[2483.14 → 2484.82] To solve
[2484.82 → 2485.54] Our situation
[2485.54 → 2487.30] And so we
[2487.30 → 2488.10] Appeal to
[2488.10 → 2488.58] Heaven
[2488.58 → 2489.94] Because God
[2489.94 → 2490.80] Is not
[2490.80 → 2491.44] Confined
[2491.44 → 2492.12] By any
[2492.12 → 2492.68] Limitations
[2492.68 → 2494.88] God is not
[2494.88 → 2495.50] Enslaved to
[2495.50 → 2495.78] Anything
[2495.78 → 2496.12] He is
[2496.12 → 2496.64] Perfectly
[2496.64 → 2496.94] Free
[2496.94 → 2497.40] He does
[2497.40 → 2497.98] As he
[2497.98 → 2498.66] Pleases
[2498.66 → 2499.02] According
[2499.02 → 2499.52] To his
[2499.52 → 2499.78] Holy
[2499.78 → 2500.10] Will
[2500.10 → 2500.68] God
[2500.68 → 2501.24] Can do
[2501.24 → 2501.60] It
[2501.60 → 2502.20] Whether
[2502.20 → 2503.06] We see
[2503.06 → 2503.40] It or
[2503.40 → 2503.88] Not
[2503.88 → 2504.78] So often
[2504.78 → 2505.06] In our
[2505.06 → 2505.68] Situations
[2505.68 → 2506.88] We can't
[2506.88 → 2507.16] See a
[2507.16 → 2507.48] Solution
[2507.48 → 2508.16] We can't
[2508.16 → 2508.46] See a
[2508.46 → 2508.60] Way
[2508.60 → 2509.42] Out
[2509.42 → 2510.70] But God
[2510.70 → 2512.06] Sees it
[2512.06 → 2512.46] And he
[2512.46 → 2512.88] Makes the
[2512.88 → 2513.08] Way
[2513.08 → 2515.02] So the
[2515.02 → 2515.50] Reformer
[2515.50 → 2516.26] John Calvin
[2516.26 → 2516.92] Says it
[2516.92 → 2517.38] This way
[2517.38 → 2517.68] In his
[2517.68 → 2518.24] Commentary
[2518.24 → 2518.56] On Psalm
[2518.56 → 2518.96] 123
[2518.96 → 2520.52] He says
[2520.52 → 2520.54] He says
[2520.54 → 2521.02] When
[2521.02 → 2521.98] No hope
[2521.98 → 2522.70] Of aid
[2522.70 → 2523.22] Is left
[2523.22 → 2523.66] For God's
[2523.66 → 2523.96] People
[2523.96 → 2524.58] On earth
[2524.58 → 2525.30] Yea
[2525.30 → 2525.74] Rather
[2525.74 → 2526.20] When their
[2526.20 → 2526.76] Condition
[2526.76 → 2527.58] Is desperate
[2527.58 → 2528.64] Just as if
[2528.64 → 2528.88] They were
[2528.88 → 2529.46] Laid in
[2529.46 → 2530.00] The grave
[2530.00 → 2531.12] They should
[2531.12 → 2531.88] Then remember
[2531.88 → 2532.28] That the
[2532.28 → 2533.00] Power of
[2533.00 → 2533.28] God
[2533.28 → 2533.84] Remains
[2533.84 → 2534.28] In heaven
[2534.28 → 2534.82] And
[2534.82 → 2536.32] Unimpaired
[2536.32 → 2538.38] In infinite
[2538.38 → 2538.98] Perfection
[2538.98 → 2540.98] Right
[2540.98 → 2541.54] You have to love
[2541.54 → 2542.00] John Calvin
[2542.00 → 2543.24] Like that's
[2543.24 → 2544.10] That's awesome
[2544.10 → 2547.28] The power
[2547.28 → 2547.80] Of God
[2547.80 → 2548.46] Remains
[2548.46 → 2549.04] In heaven
[2549.04 → 2550.42] In unimpaired
[2550.42 → 2551.54] And infinite
[2551.54 → 2552.32] Perfection
[2552.32 → 2554.06] You know
[2554.06 → 2554.58] What that means
[2554.58 → 2555.02] Is that just
[2555.02 → 2556.06] Because you
[2556.06 → 2556.78] Can't imagine
[2556.78 → 2557.22] A way
[2557.22 → 2557.96] For freedom
[2557.96 → 2558.82] Or for joy
[2558.82 → 2560.12] Or for justice
[2560.12 → 2560.78] Or salvation
[2560.78 → 2561.58] To prevail
[2561.58 → 2562.44] Doesn't mean
[2562.44 → 2562.80] That God
[2562.80 → 2563.36] Cannot make
[2563.36 → 2563.70] A way
[2563.70 → 2564.80] Right
[2564.80 → 2565.18] God can
[2565.18 → 2565.52] Take a
[2565.52 → 2565.98] Situation
[2565.98 → 2566.42] Where there
[2566.42 → 2566.90] Is no
[2566.90 → 2567.16] Way
[2567.16 → 2567.62] And he
[2567.62 → 2568.18] Can fashion
[2568.18 → 2568.62] A way
[2568.62 → 2570.78] He can
[2570.78 → 2571.10] Make
[2571.10 → 2571.84] As the
[2571.84 → 2572.04] Bible
[2572.04 → 2572.54] Tells us
[2572.54 → 2573.26] Streams
[2573.26 → 2573.60] Flow
[2573.60 → 2573.98] In a
[2573.98 → 2574.28] Desert
[2574.28 → 2575.68] He can
[2575.68 → 2575.94] Bring
[2575.94 → 2576.34] Dead
[2576.34 → 2576.90] Bones
[2576.90 → 2577.28] Back
[2577.28 → 2577.74] To life
[2577.74 → 2580.18] So I
[2580.18 → 2580.48] Heard this
[2580.48 → 2580.90] Story
[2580.90 → 2581.62] That Billy
[2581.62 → 2582.04] Graham
[2582.04 → 2582.76] Told
[2582.76 → 2583.30] In a
[2583.30 → 2583.66] Sermon
[2583.66 → 2584.94] He told
[2584.94 → 2585.66] About a
[2585.66 → 2586.52] Famous
[2586.52 → 2587.72] Painting
[2587.72 → 2588.26] Hanging
[2588.26 → 2588.72] In a
[2588.72 → 2589.24] Museum
[2589.24 → 2590.52] In Paris
[2590.52 → 2591.22] And on
[2591.22 → 2591.88] One side
[2591.88 → 2592.06] Of the
[2592.06 → 2592.46] Painting
[2592.46 → 2592.82] Is the
[2592.82 → 2593.10] Devil
[2593.10 → 2594.20] And on
[2594.20 → 2594.42] The other
[2594.42 → 2594.80] Side
[2594.80 → 2595.18] Is a
[2595.18 → 2595.38] Young
[2595.38 → 2595.66] Boy
[2595.66 → 2596.34] About 16
[2596.34 → 2596.64] Years
[2596.64 → 2597.00] Old
[2597.00 → 2597.46] And they're
[2597.46 → 2597.70] Playing
[2597.70 → 2598.14] Chess
[2598.14 → 2599.48] And the
[2599.48 → 2599.94] Devil
[2599.94 → 2600.56] Has this
[2600.56 → 2601.20] Leering
[2601.20 → 2602.20] Triumphant
[2602.20 → 2602.90] Expression
[2602.90 → 2603.30] On his
[2603.30 → 2603.62] Face
[2603.62 → 2604.30] Because he
[2604.30 → 2604.62] Has just
[2604.62 → 2604.98] Beaten
[2604.98 → 2605.30] The boy
[2605.30 → 2605.78] In chess
[2605.78 → 2607.04] The boy
[2607.04 → 2608.44] Is sitting
[2608.44 → 2608.86] There
[2608.86 → 2609.54] And he's
[2609.54 → 2610.36] Downcast
[2610.36 → 2610.60] He's
[2610.60 → 2611.38] Despondent
[2611.38 → 2612.42] With big
[2612.42 → 2612.84] Tears
[2612.84 → 2613.20] In his
[2613.20 → 2613.66] Eyes
[2613.66 → 2614.22] The devil
[2614.22 → 2614.70] Has just
[2614.70 → 2615.16] Won
[2615.16 → 2615.60] Over this
[2615.60 → 2615.90] Game
[2615.90 → 2616.70] Of life
[2616.70 → 2618.18] Over this
[2618.18 → 2618.46] Boy
[2618.46 → 2619.82] And he
[2619.82 → 2620.06] Sees
[2620.06 → 2620.56] No way
[2620.56 → 2620.86] Out
[2620.86 → 2622.28] Right
[2622.28 → 2623.28] He's
[2623.28 → 2623.74] Given up
[2623.74 → 2625.02] The title
[2625.02 → 2625.40] Of the
[2625.40 → 2625.86] Painting
[2625.86 → 2626.44] Is
[2626.44 → 2626.98] Checkmate
[2626.98 → 2628.88] So one
[2628.88 → 2629.12] Day
[2629.12 → 2629.80] A famous
[2629.80 → 2630.56] Chess
[2630.56 → 2631.08] Master
[2631.08 → 2632.08] Visited
[2632.08 → 2632.64] The museum
[2632.64 → 2633.24] And he's
[2633.24 → 2634.16] Looking around
[2634.16 → 2634.66] With his
[2634.66 → 2635.14] Group of
[2635.14 → 2635.52] Friends
[2635.52 → 2635.94] And he
[2635.94 → 2636.80] Comes across
[2636.80 → 2637.24] This painting
[2637.24 → 2637.48] And he
[2637.48 → 2637.94] Stops
[2637.94 → 2639.82] And he
[2639.82 → 2640.32] Looks at
[2640.32 → 2640.58] It for
[2640.58 → 2640.90] A long
[2640.90 → 2641.26] Time
[2641.26 → 2641.52] You know
[2641.52 → 2641.74] He
[2641.74 → 2642.44] He felt
[2642.44 → 2642.76] Sorry
[2642.76 → 2643.12] For this
[2643.12 → 2643.50] Boy
[2643.50 → 2644.68] He hated
[2644.68 → 2645.04] The look
[2645.04 → 2645.26] Of the
[2645.26 → 2645.52] Devil
[2645.52 → 2646.74] And so he
[2646.74 → 2647.12] Began to
[2647.12 → 2647.56] Study the
[2647.56 → 2647.94] Painting
[2647.94 → 2648.24] And he's
[2648.24 → 2648.74] Looking at
[2648.74 → 2648.80] It
[2648.80 → 2648.92] He's
[2648.92 → 2649.14] Turning
[2649.14 → 2649.38] His
[2649.38 → 2649.72] Head
[2649.72 → 2650.04] He's
[2650.04 → 2650.46] He's
[2650.46 → 2650.96] Staring
[2650.96 → 2651.36] He's
[2651.36 → 2651.96] Pondering
[2651.96 → 2652.24] It
[2652.24 → 2653.32] And then all
[2653.32 → 2653.70] Of a sudden
[2653.70 → 2654.58] He shouted
[2654.58 → 2656.04] This painting
[2656.04 → 2656.44] Is
[2656.44 → 2657.34] Misnamed
[2657.34 → 2658.78] This is
[2658.78 → 2658.96] Not
[2658.96 → 2659.40] Checkmate
[2659.40 → 2660.98] He said
[2660.98 → 2661.80] You know
[2661.80 → 2662.24] He's like
[2662.24 → 2663.36] He's into it
[2663.36 → 2663.74] He's forgetting
[2663.74 → 2664.08] He's just
[2664.08 → 2664.34] Talking to
[2664.34 → 2664.76] A painting
[2664.76 → 2665.18] He says
[2665.18 → 2665.84] Son
[2665.84 → 2666.30] I have
[2666.30 → 2666.60] Found
[2666.60 → 2667.14] A move
[2667.14 → 2668.32] One
[2668.32 → 2669.08] Move
[2669.08 → 2669.70] If you
[2669.70 → 2670.08] Will make
[2670.08 → 2670.56] That move
[2670.56 → 2670.84] You can
[2670.84 → 2671.18] Beat the
[2671.18 → 2671.44] Devil
[2671.44 → 2673.46] And then
[2673.46 → 2673.84] Billy Graham
[2673.84 → 2674.46] Says this
[2674.46 → 2675.68] That is
[2675.68 → 2676.40] What Jesus
[2676.40 → 2677.20] Being enthroned
[2677.20 → 2677.76] In heaven
[2677.76 → 2678.34] Means for
[2678.34 → 2678.52] Us
[2678.52 → 2678.84] Today
[2678.84 → 2680.60] When
[2680.60 → 2681.00] Jesus
[2681.00 → 2681.64] Christ
[2681.64 → 2682.94] Lifeless
[2682.94 → 2683.60] Body
[2683.60 → 2684.68] Was
[2684.68 → 2685.20] Laid
[2685.20 → 2685.58] In the
[2685.58 → 2685.90] Tomb
[2685.90 → 2687.64] The
[2687.64 → 2688.24] Stone
[2688.24 → 2689.00] Rolled
[2689.00 → 2689.84] In front
[2689.84 → 2691.48] They were
[2691.48 → 2691.86] All ready
[2691.86 → 2692.82] To shout
[2692.82 → 2693.68] Checkmate
[2693.68 → 2695.00] Right
[2695.00 → 2695.38] They were
[2695.38 → 2696.14] Convinced
[2696.14 → 2697.34] That evil
[2697.34 → 2698.06] And oppression
[2698.06 → 2699.44] Had the
[2699.44 → 2700.10] Final say
[2700.10 → 2701.02] That was
[2701.02 → 2701.22] It
[2701.22 → 2702.62] But what
[2702.62 → 2703.18] They didn't
[2703.18 → 2703.84] Realize
[2703.84 → 2704.50] Is that
[2704.50 → 2705.06] The king
[2705.06 → 2705.88] Of heaven
[2705.88 → 2706.84] Had one
[2706.84 → 2707.64] More move
[2707.64 → 2708.96] And on
[2708.96 → 2709.40] The third
[2709.40 → 2709.78] Day
[2709.78 → 2710.62] Jesus
[2710.62 → 2711.12] Rose
[2711.12 → 2711.14] Rose
[2711.14 → 2711.36] From
[2711.36 → 2711.50] The
[2711.50 → 2711.82] Dead
[2711.82 → 2714.08] And the
[2714.08 → 2714.60] King
[2714.60 → 2715.34] Made a
[2715.34 → 2715.62] Move
[2715.62 → 2716.04] That would
[2716.04 → 2716.56] Win
[2716.56 → 2717.62] The victory
[2717.62 → 2718.40] Over sin
[2718.40 → 2719.02] And death
[2719.02 → 2719.66] And the
[2719.66 → 2719.96] Devil
[2719.96 → 2721.54] And friends
[2721.54 → 2722.02] Today
[2722.02 → 2722.58] We are
[2722.58 → 2723.10] The people
[2723.10 → 2723.66] Of God
[2723.66 → 2723.94] And we
[2723.94 → 2724.48] Live in
[2724.48 → 2724.92] Light
[2724.92 → 2725.34] Of the
[2725.34 → 2725.80] Glory
[2725.80 → 2726.92] Of that
[2726.92 → 2728.18] Final move
[2728.18 → 2729.80] We are
[2729.80 → 2730.24] People
[2730.24 → 2731.28] Of resurrection
[2731.28 → 2731.68] Hope
[2731.68 → 2733.16] And that
[2733.16 → 2733.60] Means that
[2733.60 → 2734.16] No matter
[2734.16 → 2734.92] What our
[2734.92 → 2735.56] Situation
[2735.56 → 2736.42] Looks like
[2736.42 → 2737.80] How impossible
[2737.80 → 2738.84] Our situation
[2738.84 → 2739.38] Appears
[2739.38 → 2739.82] And no matter
[2739.82 → 2740.52] How desperate
[2740.52 → 2741.02] We find
[2741.02 → 2741.50] Ourselves
[2741.50 → 2742.84] We can
[2742.84 → 2743.68] Lift our
[2743.68 → 2744.42] Eyes
[2744.42 → 2745.16] To the
[2745.16 → 2745.94] Risen king
[2745.94 → 2746.58] Who sits
[2746.58 → 2747.58] Enthroned
[2747.58 → 2748.44] In heaven
[2748.44 → 2749.20] Above all
[2749.20 → 2749.64] Things
[2749.64 → 2750.76] He is
[2750.76 → 2751.46] Victorious
[2751.46 → 2753.70] You know
[2753.70 → 2754.16] I think
[2754.16 → 2754.64] Sometimes
[2754.64 → 2754.88] On
[2754.88 → 2755.84] You know
[2755.84 → 2755.98] We are
[2755.98 → 2756.30] Looking at
[2756.30 → 2756.94] This song
[2756.94 → 2757.80] These songs
[2757.80 → 2758.62] Of ascent
[2758.62 → 2758.90] This
[2758.90 → 2760.50] Pilgrimage
[2760.50 → 2761.02] That God's
[2761.02 → 2761.74] People took
[2761.74 → 2763.88] As a way
[2763.88 → 2764.30] To think about
[2764.30 → 2764.60] Our own
[2764.60 → 2765.20] Pilgrimages
[2765.20 → 2765.54] Right
[2765.54 → 2766.26] This life
[2766.26 → 2766.58] Is a
[2766.58 → 2766.88] Journey
[2766.88 → 2768.32] And sometimes
[2768.32 → 2768.96] Our own
[2768.96 → 2769.64] Pilgrimages
[2769.64 → 2770.78] Our eyes
[2770.78 → 2771.42] Can be
[2771.42 → 2771.92] Focused
[2771.92 → 2773.14] Downward
[2773.14 → 2775.04] Or on
[2775.04 → 2775.60] What's
[2775.60 → 2776.44] All around
[2776.44 → 2776.86] Us
[2776.86 → 2777.92] You know
[2777.92 → 2778.18] I think
[2778.18 → 2778.44] About
[2778.44 → 2778.94] Peter
[2778.94 → 2780.36] Stepping
[2780.36 → 2780.62] Out of
[2780.62 → 2780.96] The boat
[2780.96 → 2781.22] And what
[2781.22 → 2781.44] Does he
[2781.44 → 2781.70] Do
[2781.70 → 2783.26] He looks
[2783.26 → 2783.64] Down
[2783.64 → 2784.02] At the
[2784.02 → 2784.70] Waves
[2784.70 → 2785.46] All around
[2785.46 → 2785.82] Him
[2785.82 → 2787.66] And
[2787.66 → 2788.48] The deep
[2788.48 → 2788.92] Water
[2788.92 → 2789.46] And he
[2789.46 → 2790.22] Feels like
[2790.22 → 2790.96] He is
[2790.96 → 2791.54] About to
[2791.54 → 2792.00] Sink
[2792.00 → 2793.30] But then
[2793.30 → 2793.52] What does
[2793.52 → 2793.78] Jesus
[2793.78 → 2794.06] Do
[2794.06 → 2794.74] Jesus
[2794.74 → 2795.90] Calls
[2795.90 → 2796.18] Him
[2796.18 → 2797.20] He takes
[2797.20 → 2797.90] His eyes
[2797.90 → 2798.24] And he
[2798.24 → 2799.32] Turns Peter's
[2799.32 → 2800.04] Eyes toward
[2800.04 → 2800.40] Him
[2800.40 → 2801.02] And he
[2801.02 → 2801.50] Gently
[2801.50 → 2802.08] Says
[2802.08 → 2804.34] He reminds
[2804.34 → 2804.86] Peter how
[2804.86 → 2805.40] Loved he
[2805.40 → 2805.72] Is
[2805.72 → 2806.56] How forgiven
[2806.56 → 2807.40] He is
[2807.40 → 2808.26] He calls
[2808.26 → 2808.62] Him to
[2808.62 → 2809.10] Faith and
[2809.10 → 2809.48] Trust
[2809.48 → 2810.38] And he
[2810.38 → 2810.54] Says
[2810.54 → 2810.86] Let me
[2810.86 → 2811.30] Show my
[2811.30 → 2811.78] Favour and
[2811.78 → 2812.18] My mercy
[2812.18 → 2812.62] On you
[2812.62 → 2815.60] And that's
[2815.60 → 2816.20] What God
[2816.20 → 2817.50] Does for
[2817.50 → 2817.90] Each one
[2817.90 → 2818.36] Of us
[2818.36 → 2819.92] Okay so
[2819.92 → 2820.54] Here's the
[2820.54 → 2821.14] Question that
[2821.14 → 2821.60] We need to
[2821.60 → 2822.20] Consider this
[2822.20 → 2822.48] Morning
[2822.48 → 2824.22] Where do
[2824.22 → 2824.64] Your eyes
[2824.64 → 2824.96] Look
[2824.96 → 2826.62] Where do
[2826.62 → 2827.00] Your eyes
[2827.00 → 2827.32] Look
[2827.32 → 2828.74] Where do
[2828.74 → 2829.34] Your eyes
[2829.34 → 2830.20] Go when
[2830.20 → 2830.86] They meet
[2830.86 → 2831.88] The contempt
[2831.88 → 2832.74] And scorn
[2832.74 → 2833.18] Of the
[2833.18 → 2833.52] World
[2833.52 → 2834.30] Around you
[2834.30 → 2837.04] It's easy
[2837.04 → 2838.14] To cast
[2838.14 → 2838.80] Our eyes
[2838.80 → 2839.82] Down
[2839.82 → 2841.88] That's the
[2841.88 → 2842.48] Shame that
[2842.48 → 2843.00] We feel
[2843.00 → 2843.80] When we
[2843.80 → 2844.58] Are treated
[2844.58 → 2845.32] With contempt
[2845.32 → 2845.80] We feel
[2845.80 → 2846.42] The shame
[2846.42 → 2846.84] Of our
[2846.84 → 2847.66] Of being
[2847.66 → 2848.06] Sinful
[2848.06 → 2848.48] People
[2848.48 → 2849.92] And because
[2849.92 → 2850.52] Of that
[2850.52 → 2851.32] Shame that
[2851.32 → 2851.74] We feel
[2851.74 → 2853.14] Most prominently
[2853.14 → 2853.42] At that
[2853.42 → 2853.86] Time
[2853.86 → 2854.74] We turn
[2854.74 → 2855.08] Our eyes
[2855.08 → 2855.50] Down
[2855.50 → 2856.44] We're
[2856.44 → 2856.90] Ashamed
[2856.90 → 2857.10] We're
[2857.10 → 2857.98] Embarrassed
[2857.98 → 2859.48] But
[2859.48 → 2860.88] Jesus died
[2860.88 → 2861.24] For us
[2861.24 → 2861.58] He has
[2861.58 → 2862.48] Taken away
[2862.48 → 2862.96] Our shame
[2862.96 → 2863.24] And he
[2863.24 → 2863.64] Calls us
[2863.64 → 2864.16] To lift
[2864.16 → 2864.52] Up our
[2864.52 → 2864.94] Eyes
[2864.94 → 2866.34] We can
[2866.34 → 2866.76] Lift our
[2866.76 → 2867.16] Eyes
[2867.16 → 2867.48] To the
[2867.48 → 2867.70] Risen
[2867.70 → 2868.08] Jesus
[2868.08 → 2868.94] Who is
[2868.94 → 2869.40] Enthroned
[2869.40 → 2869.82] Above all
[2869.82 → 2870.24] Things
[2870.24 → 2871.74] So that
[2871.74 → 2872.04] Is
[2872.04 → 2873.40] God's
[2873.40 → 2874.70] Perspective
[2874.70 → 2875.36] For the
[2875.36 → 2875.78] Fed up
[2875.78 → 2878.12] But we
[2878.12 → 2878.52] Also see
[2878.52 → 2878.76] God's
[2878.76 → 2879.18] Protection
[2879.18 → 2879.58] For the
[2879.58 → 2879.96] Fed up
[2879.96 → 2881.42] So if
[2881.42 → 2881.68] We look
[2881.68 → 2882.00] At verse
[2882.00 → 2882.32] Two
[2882.32 → 2882.66] This is
[2882.66 → 2882.92] What it
[2882.92 → 2883.26] Says
[2883.26 → 2884.28] As the
[2884.28 → 2885.12] Eyes of
[2885.12 → 2886.32] Slaves
[2886.32 → 2886.84] Look to
[2886.84 → 2887.32] The hand
[2887.32 → 2887.56] Of their
[2887.56 → 2887.96] Master
[2887.96 → 2889.04] As the
[2889.04 → 2889.54] Eyes of
[2889.54 → 2889.92] A female
[2889.92 → 2890.28] Slave
[2890.28 → 2890.68] Look to
[2890.68 → 2891.00] The hand
[2891.00 → 2891.26] Of her
[2891.26 → 2891.54] Mistress
[2891.54 → 2892.44] So our
[2892.44 → 2892.74] Eyes
[2892.74 → 2893.10] Look to
[2893.10 → 2893.46] The Lord
[2893.46 → 2894.04] Our God
[2894.04 → 2894.78] Till he
[2894.78 → 2895.34] Shows us
[2895.34 → 2895.92] His mercy
[2895.92 → 2897.30] Okay so
[2897.30 → 2898.30] This image
[2898.30 → 2898.68] That the
[2898.68 → 2898.98] Psalmist
[2898.98 → 2899.38] Is using
[2899.38 → 2900.62] Of slaves
[2900.62 → 2900.94] Or it
[2900.94 → 2901.16] Can also
[2901.16 → 2901.32] Be
[2901.32 → 2901.78] Translated
[2901.78 → 2902.58] As servants
[2902.58 → 2903.14] Servants
[2903.14 → 2903.70] And masters
[2903.70 → 2904.72] A female
[2904.72 → 2905.14] Servant
[2905.14 → 2905.48] And her
[2905.48 → 2905.82] Mistress
[2905.82 → 2906.86] What it's
[2906.86 → 2907.22] Doing is
[2907.22 → 2907.68] It's drawing
[2907.68 → 2907.96] On this
[2907.96 → 2908.50] Imagery
[2908.50 → 2909.26] Of belonging
[2909.26 → 2910.42] And responsibility
[2910.42 → 2911.62] And of
[2911.62 → 2912.62] Union
[2912.62 → 2913.24] Protection
[2913.24 → 2914.56] Right this
[2914.56 → 2915.14] Passage is
[2915.14 → 2915.94] Emphasizing the
[2915.94 → 2916.38] Fact and
[2916.38 → 2916.90] That and we
[2916.90 → 2917.34] Need to lay
[2917.34 → 2917.90] Hold of the
[2917.90 → 2918.90] Fact that we
[2918.90 → 2919.82] Belong to
[2919.82 → 2920.36] God by
[2920.36 → 2920.74] Covenant
[2920.74 → 2922.02] That he
[2922.02 → 2922.50] Is our
[2922.50 → 2922.98] God and
[2922.98 → 2923.38] We are
[2923.38 → 2924.02] His people
[2924.02 → 2925.40] We are
[2925.40 → 2926.10] Those who
[2926.10 → 2926.88] Belong to
[2926.88 → 2927.14] Him
[2927.14 → 2928.50] Right and
[2928.50 → 2928.84] That's this
[2928.84 → 2929.20] That's the
[2929.20 → 2929.72] Whole picture
[2929.72 → 2930.04] That we're
[2930.04 → 2930.52] Getting here
[2930.52 → 2931.22] Of masters
[2931.22 → 2931.94] And mistresses
[2931.94 → 2933.30] It means
[2933.30 → 2933.86] That we are
[2933.86 → 2934.70] Claimed by
[2934.70 → 2935.08] Him that
[2935.08 → 2935.46] We are
[2935.46 → 2936.20] Servants
[2936.20 → 2937.16] For whom
[2937.16 → 2937.78] God has
[2937.78 → 2938.30] Personally
[2938.30 → 2939.16] Taken
[2939.16 → 2940.30] Responsibility
[2940.30 → 2941.58] And care
[2941.58 → 2942.32] Over us
[2942.32 → 2944.12] Right and
[2944.12 → 2944.38] What does
[2944.38 → 2944.70] That mean
[2944.70 → 2945.02] It means
[2945.02 → 2945.30] That we
[2945.30 → 2945.62] Are not
[2945.62 → 2945.94] On this
[2945.94 → 2946.26] Journey
[2946.26 → 2947.66] All alone
[2947.66 → 2949.28] We are
[2949.28 → 2950.08] Not by
[2950.08 → 2950.66] Ourselves
[2950.66 → 2951.02] We are
[2951.02 → 2951.50] Not in
[2951.50 → 2951.94] Hard
[2951.94 → 2952.80] Situations
[2952.80 → 2953.36] Alone
[2953.36 → 2953.68] Right
[2953.68 → 2954.00] God has
[2954.00 → 2954.40] Not left
[2954.40 → 2954.70] Us to
[2954.70 → 2955.18] Fend for
[2955.18 → 2955.74] Ourselves
[2955.74 → 2956.08] Or to
[2956.08 → 2956.30] Pull
[2956.30 → 2956.66] Ourselves
[2956.66 → 2957.24] Up by
[2957.24 → 2957.50] Our
[2957.50 → 2958.14] Bootstraps
[2958.14 → 2958.64] Praise
[2958.64 → 2958.82] The
[2958.82 → 2958.96] Lord
[2958.96 → 2959.12] For
[2959.12 → 2959.44] That
[2959.44 → 2961.40] Thank
[2961.40 → 2961.58] You
[2961.58 → 2964.44] God
[2964.44 → 2965.62] Claims
[2965.62 → 2965.84] You
[2965.84 → 2966.50] As
[2966.50 → 2966.80] His
[2966.80 → 2967.18] Own
[2967.18 → 2968.66] And
[2968.66 → 2968.88] God
[2968.88 → 2969.30] Has
[2969.30 → 2970.12] Taken
[2970.12 → 2971.42] Responsibility
[2971.42 → 2972.34] For
[2972.34 → 2972.64] You
[2972.64 → 2973.78] The
[2973.78 → 2974.10] Glorious
[2974.10 → 2974.72] Reality
[2974.72 → 2975.72] Is
[2975.72 → 2976.62] Our
[2976.62 → 2977.20] Comfort
[2977.20 → 2977.50] And
[2977.50 → 2977.76] Hope
[2977.76 → 2977.88] In
[2977.88 → 2978.16] Every
[2978.16 → 2978.72] Situation
[2978.72 → 2979.60] In
[2979.60 → 2979.90] Life
[2979.90 → 2980.16] And
[2980.16 → 2980.28] In
[2980.28 → 2980.52] Death
[2980.52 → 2980.64] Is
[2980.64 → 2980.74] That
[2980.74 → 2980.86] We
[2980.86 → 2981.18] Belong
[2981.18 → 2981.34] To
[2981.34 → 2981.58] God
[2981.58 → 2981.78] Right
[2981.78 → 2982.16] And
[2982.16 → 2982.38] It
[2982.38 → 2982.78] Reminds
[2982.78 → 2982.92] Us
[2982.92 → 2983.28] Of
[2983.28 → 2984.34] The
[2984.34 → 2984.70] Heidelberg
[2984.70 → 2985.30] Catechism
[2985.30 → 2985.66] Question
[2985.66 → 2985.86] And
[2985.86 → 2986.08] Answer
[2986.08 → 2986.34] One
[2986.34 → 2986.62] That
[2986.62 → 2986.74] We
[2986.74 → 2987.00] All
[2987.00 → 2987.26] Know
[2987.26 → 2987.44] And
[2987.44 → 2987.64] Love
[2987.64 → 2987.84] So
[2987.84 → 2988.18] Much
[2988.18 → 2989.12] He
[2989.12 → 2989.52] Ask
[2989.52 → 2990.12] What
[2990.12 → 2990.46] Is
[2990.46 → 2990.60] Your
[2990.60 → 2990.90] Only
[2990.90 → 2991.36] Comfort
[2991.36 → 2991.60] In

[3108.82 → 3108.94] In
[3108.94 → 3109.18] Verse
[3109.18 → 3110.92] And
[3110.92 → 3111.12] That's
[3111.12 → 3111.22] How
[3111.22 → 3111.32] The
[3111.32 → 3111.40] Way
[3111.40 → 3111.54] The
[3111.54 → 3111.68] Psalm
[3111.68 → 3112.02] Ends
[3112.02 → 3112.12] It
[3112.12 → 3112.54] Ends
[3112.54 → 3112.84] In
[3112.84 → 3113.88] Expectation
[3113.88 → 3114.68] Unfulfilled
[3114.68 → 3115.52] Expectation
[3115.52 → 3116.56] If
[3116.56 → 3116.66] You
[3116.66 → 3116.78] Look
[3116.78 → 3116.88] At
[3116.88 → 3117.02] Verse
[3117.02 → 3117.20] Two
[3117.20 → 3117.30] It
[3117.30 → 3117.46] Says
[3117.46 → 3117.68] Our
[3117.68 → 3118.02] Eyes
[3118.02 → 3118.28] Look
[3118.28 → 3118.44] To
[3118.44 → 3118.60] The
[3118.60 → 3118.80] Lord
[3118.80 → 3119.00] Our
[3119.00 → 3119.46] God
[3119.46 → 3120.82] Until
[3120.82 → 3121.60] He
[3121.60 → 3121.90] Shows
[3121.90 → 3122.06] Us
[3122.06 → 3122.22] His
[3122.22 → 3122.52] Mercy
[3123.34 → 3123.46] κι
[3123.46 → 3126.10] The
[3126.10 → 3127.14] He
[3127.14 → 3127.92] Same
[3127.92 → 3133.76] Musенное
[3133.76 → 3135.68] Wolfe
[3135.68 → 3136.38] Iraq
[3136.38 → 3137.76] WOW
[3137.76 → 3138.42] comfortably
[3138.42 → 3139.00] Right
[3139.00 → 3146.76] We
[3146.76 → 3147.04] Come
[3147.04 → 3156.46] to fulfill this longing for mercy and to show us the extent, the fullness of the mercy and love of
[3156.46 → 3163.36] God for us as people. And what did Jesus do? Jesus walked this pilgrim road to Jerusalem,
[3163.96 → 3168.68] just like these people did. He actually literally walked that road to the temple,
[3168.68 → 3177.86] and he, on that road, especially from Jerusalem to the mount where he died, he faced scorn,
[3178.84 → 3187.06] right? He faced contempt. Furthermore, he was rejected without deserving it. Furthermore, he was spit on. His friends deserted
[3187.06 → 3194.88] him, right? And on the cross, all the contempt that we in our own sin show to other people,
[3194.88 → 3202.92] right? We show contempt. And all the contempt of this world that often falls on us,
[3203.72 → 3208.70] all of it instead fell on Jesus, right? So that we might know his mercy.
[3210.10 → 3215.96] And because of what Jesus has done for you, God now looks upon you, and when you lift your eyes
[3215.96 → 3223.80] to him, you don't meet the eyes of another oppressor, but you meet the eyes of not condemnation,
[3223.80 → 3226.14] but of love and of mercy and of grace.
[3228.76 → 3235.64] And so we now, through Jesus, have God's protection with us, whether we realize it or not, in every
[3235.64 → 3247.56] situation. The pastor tells this story of raising his two young boys in a rough city. And he wouldn't
[3247.56 → 3253.94] let his boys go out alone. But they always begged him. They begged him to let them walk to the store
[3253.94 → 3260.48] alone, right? They just wanted their independence. Mom and dad, just let me go, right? Just let me do
[3260.48 → 3265.42] this. So these kids, they convinced their father to let them go, and they were so excited they were
[3265.42 → 3272.26] going to get to go to the store by themselves. But what they didn't realize is that when they walked
[3272.26 → 3278.58] out the front door, their dad walked out the back door. And so as they were, you know, just strutting
[3278.58 → 3284.58] down the street, free, experiencing this independence, little did they know that their father was on a
[3284.58 → 3293.02] parallel street, following them and watching them, just out of sight. So they went to the store, and they
[3293.02 → 3300.10] bought their candy, and they were on their way back home. And on the way back home, they came across a stray
[3300.10 → 3309.92] and very angry pit bull. And this pit bull looked at them and started to snarl and bark, and started to
[3309.92 → 3315.70] step toward the children. And of course, the children stopped, and they were, you know, shaking, and the
[3315.70 → 3321.74] pit bull could sense their fear, and it kept walking towards them. It was just about to attack until they
[3321.74 → 3329.98] saw the boy's dad walk up behind them with a big stick in his hand. And the children,
[3330.10 → 3338.10] men never saw their father, but that dog did. And when the dog saw the stick in their father's hands,
[3338.58 → 3343.84] it took off running. Amen?
[3345.98 → 3354.34] Right? We worship a God who is spirit. That's hard for us to wrap our minds around. We worship a God in
[3354.34 → 3361.02] spirit and in truth. And though we might not see God now in this side of reality, guess what?
[3362.34 → 3369.58] The Lord has put his name on you. The Lord has put his spirit in you. You are his child. And you may
[3369.58 → 3379.06] not see the Lord, but trouble sees the Lord. Right? And trouble responds to his authoritative presence
[3379.06 → 3388.14] in your life. Because all things in heaven and on earth are placed under his feet. Right? And so,
[3388.26 → 3399.74] he is with us to ensure that we ultimately make it home. That he will bring us safely to his glorious
[3399.74 → 3408.02] presence. Of course, we may meet trouble along the way. But ultimately, we belong to God.
[3408.02 → 3415.92] That's the comfort of being claimed by God in life and in death. Body and soul. We belong to him.
[3416.98 → 3419.84] And so, brothers and sisters, take comfort today in the Lord's perspective.
[3421.32 → 3427.78] You can look to him enthroned in heaven. He is seated above everything that you would face on this
[3427.78 → 3433.28] pilgrim road. And also, take comfort in the Lord's protection. Right? He's not just high in the heavens.
[3433.28 → 3440.60] He has come down low to us in Jesus to be with us. And he has sealed our redemption on the cross.
[3440.76 → 3445.06] And we belong to him. That's good news. Let's pray together.
[3445.06 → 3458.06] Father, when we face the contempt like this psalm talks about. The contempt of the proud. The
[3458.06 → 3469.52] arrogance of oppression that we see all around us. In our societies. Maybe even in our homes. In our
[3469.52 → 3475.54] workplaces. In our neighbourhoods. Father, we can't sometimes do anything but cry out to you.
[3476.16 → 3481.36] Because we're fed up. And you're fed up too. And that's why Jesus came.
[3482.72 → 3490.60] He came to do, to bring an end to oppression. To bring life and flourishing to bear. And that is
[3490.60 → 3500.94] even now, although not yet. But already it has come. And it is coming into our own lives. It's coming
[3500.94 → 3506.72] into this world. And Lord, you are still active by your Holy Spirit through your church. So Lord,
[3506.78 → 3514.74] as ones who have received your mercy, may we then turn and show mercy to others. As our shame has been
[3514.74 → 3525.90] taken away from us. Help us to lift the shame from the shoulders of other people. Lord, would you remind
[3525.90 → 3534.14] us of our identity. That we belong to you. And would you help us to point the way and to lead others
[3534.14 → 3539.62] onto this road of going to worship you. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3539.62 → 3546.08] I invite you to stand. Let's all stand. And let's sing the Song of Response.
[3546.08 → 3573.08] I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me. I am weak. And I need your love to free me.
[3573.08 → 3598.08] O Lord, my Lord, my strength and weakness. You'll rescue me. O Lord, you are my hope. Your promise never fails me.
[3598.08 → 3600.08] O Lord, my strength and weakness. You'll cry out for your heart.
[3600.08 → 3615.36] And my desire is to follow you forever. For you are good. For you are good. For you are good. For you are good to me.
[3615.36 → 3624.36] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[3627.36 → 3635.36] I cry out for your hand of mercy to hear me.
[3636.36 → 3644.36] I am weak, I need your love to free me.
[3644.36 → 3656.36] O Lord, I'm safe in weakness, come rescue me.
[3657.36 → 3668.36] O Lord, you are my hope, your promise never fails me.
[3668.36 → 3676.36] And my desire is to follow you forever.
[3677.36 → 3685.36] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[3685.36 → 3695.36] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[3695.36 → 3705.36] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[3705.36 → 3707.36] You may be seated.
[3710.36 → 3713.36] So we worship a great God and King.
[3713.36 → 3717.36] And because of that, he invites us to lift our prayers before him.
[3717.36 → 3723.36] So we come now to a time when we, as a community, we pray.
[3723.36 → 3725.36] Pray for God to be at work.
[3725.36 → 3732.36] One thing we want to pray for especially is Jerry Crohn, who had a stroke and is right now in Delta View.
[3732.36 → 3736.36] He is doing okay.
[3736.36 → 3741.36] But he is there, and so let's lift him up in prayer for healing.
[3741.36 → 3760.36] Great God, our Father, we come to you, Lord, acknowledging that as we look out at the world's ills, the world's problems and the size of the world,
[3760.36 → 3770.36] the issues that we see, the injustices, the pain and the suffering, the God and the disease,
[3771.36 → 3773.36] oftentimes we find ourselves overwhelmed.
[3774.36 → 3779.36] Oftentimes we find ourselves intimidated.
[3780.36 → 3787.36] Oftentimes we find ourselves wondering if relief can ever come.
[3787.36 → 3793.36] But we're grateful, O Lord, that you assure us that as great as our problems are,
[3794.36 → 3801.36] as great as sin is in our hearts and in the world, that you are much, much greater.
[3802.36 → 3811.36] We're grateful today that you fix our eyes on your power, that your power is turned toward us.
[3813.36 → 3814.36] You are our help.
[3814.36 → 3819.36] The same God who spoke the galaxies into existence.
[3820.36 → 3823.36] The same God who holds the planets in their orbits.
[3824.36 → 3830.36] The same God who created every creature and who so wonderfully and fearfully made us.
[3831.36 → 3839.36] The same God who did all these wonderful things in the world is the same God who promises to help us in our time of need.
[3839.36 → 3847.36] And so we come to you, Lord, knowing that you are a God who is able to meet and supply our need.
[3848.36 → 3852.36] God who is able to fix all that is broken in our lives.
[3852.36 → 3858.36] There's nothing that we can bring to you that's too big for you to handle.
[3859.36 → 3862.36] And so, Father, we ask that you would bless us as a people.
[3862.36 → 3872.36] And as we think about our particular needs, the things that have long troubled our hearts and our minds,
[3873.36 → 3878.36] those things that are troubling our hearts and our minds even this morning.
[3878.36 → 3883.36] We pray, Father, that you would meet and heal each one of them.
[3884.36 → 3886.36] Father, you know what they are.
[3887.36 → 3891.36] You know what is weighing heavy on our hearts.
[3891.36 → 3904.36] Father, whether it's emotional distress or disease or financial troubles or family issues or school troubles
[3905.36 → 3907.36] or the doubts that can creep into our minds.
[3908.36 → 3910.36] Lord, you are able to bring help and healing.
[3911.36 → 3915.36] And we pray that you would do that abundantly and generously for your people.
[3915.36 → 3918.36] Lord, right now we also pray for Jerry and Ann.
[3918.36 → 3924.36] Lord, we pray that you would be with Jerry as he's even now in Delta View,
[3925.36 → 3932.36] that you would bring healing to him, that you would enable him to regain some mobility on the right side of his body.
[3933.36 → 3942.36] And Lord, we pray that you would enable him and Ann to also find a new place where they can live together and receive care.
[3942.36 → 3948.36] And so, Lord, we thank you for your steadfast love and kindness to us.
[3949.36 → 3952.36] We are not deserving, but you are willing.
[3954.36 → 3956.36] So we praise you, and we thank you.
[3956.36 → 3967.36] And we pray that you would even now be in our midst, that you would be in our hearts, that you would be among us.
[3967.36 → 3973.36] We pray all of these things in Jesus' name.
[3974.36 → 3975.36] Amen.
[3975.36 → 3985.36] So would you stand one last time and hear these words of blessing as we go out from our time of worship.
[3985.36 → 3992.36] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the blessing of God, your Heavenly Father.
[3992.36 → 4001.36] From the book of Jude, to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4001.36 → 4006.36] To the only God, our Saviour, be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[4007.36 → 4013.36] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, before all ages and now and forevermore.
[4014.36 → 4015.36] Amen.
[4017.36 → 4021.36] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final sending song.
[4031.36 → 4032.36] Amen.
[4034.36 → 4040.36] Oh, worship the King, all glorious above.
[4041.36 → 4047.36] Oh, grateful things sing His power and His love.
[4048.36 → 4060.36] Horses and defenders, the ancient of days of ill and in splendour, in earth and in praise.
[4061.36 → 4069.08] You children of dust and feeble must fail
[4069.08 → 4075.68] In you do we trust, nor find you to fail
[4075.68 → 4082.62] Your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end
[4082.62 → 4090.36] How may God defend her, redeemer and friend
[4090.36 → 4098.36] O measureless fight, unchangeable love
[4098.92 → 4106.36] O angels delight to worship above
[4106.36 → 4113.68] Your ransomed creation with glory amazed
[4113.68 → 4121.68] In true adoration shall sing to your praise
[4121.68 → 4129.68] Amen
[4129.68 → 4137.68] Amen
[4137.68 → 4139.68] Amen
[4139.68 → 4149.68] Amen
[4149.68 → 4151.68] Amen
[4151.68 → 4153.68] Amen
[4153.68 → 4155.68] Amen
[4155.68 → 4157.68] Amen
[4157.68 → 4159.68] Amen
[4159.68 → 4161.68] Amen
[4161.68 → 4163.68] Amen
[4163.68 → 4167.68] Amen
[4167.68 → 4171.68] Amen
[4171.68 → 4173.68] cannot be thought vegan
[4173.68 → 4177.68] That is why it is settled in a time
[4177.68 → 4179.68] Almost alive
[4179.68 → 4182.68] Yea, many of whom are redeemed
[4182.68 → 4184.68] oral fixed upon the world
[4184.68 → 4185.68] Namaste
[4185.68 → 4186.26] Amen.
