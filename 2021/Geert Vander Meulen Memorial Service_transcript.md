[0.00 --> 8.32]  Please be seated.
[11.38 --> 17.34]  So at this time we will invite some of our family members to come and share some memories
[17.34 --> 18.02]  of Gert.
[18.42 --> 25.00]  It is good for us to take this time to remember him and the great gift that he was to those
[25.00 --> 26.24]  who knew and loved him well.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Thank you.
[39.94 --> 41.00]  Good afternoon.
[42.70 --> 47.10]  As family, we want to say thank you for coming to Dad's memorial service.
[47.92 --> 53.24]  We know that you came here today for the same reasons that we did, to worship God, whom
[53.24 --> 56.52]  Dad loved very much, and to honour a wonderful man.
[56.52 --> 63.40]  As family, we appreciate the love and support you have given Dad over the years, and we
[63.40 --> 65.46]  thank you all for the ways that you shared that love.
[65.46 --> 69.52]  I do need to acknowledge a few particular people, and if I miss anyone, my apologies.
[69.52 --> 75.92]  To Joe Schalk, Ernst de Vries, and Hans Funkus, your faithful friendships and visits meant
[75.92 --> 76.72]  the world to Dad.
[76.72 --> 81.68]  As did going to the Skyhawk coffee shop with his good friend, Ted Vanderhorst, and they'd
[81.68 --> 83.28]  order fish and chips for breakfast.
[83.28 --> 84.52]  Thank you.
[84.52 --> 89.40]  Thank you also to Dorothy Vander Velde for the multitude of meals that you made him over the
[89.40 --> 90.40]  years.
[90.40 --> 93.96]  Thank you so much.
[93.96 --> 102.14]  It is the word Dad who filled most of cool books on my date, Shirley Gudige & Christ.
[102.14 --> 104.94]  It is my hope that I will be able to convey to you how special and precious my Dad was
[104.94 --> 105.94]  to me.
[105.94 --> 108.24]  Needing a Bible a couple of days ago, I grabbed the nearest one I could reach, which happened
[108.24 --> 109.80]  to be Dad's Bible that he always had beside his chair.
[109.80 --> 111.48]  with the word dad.
[112.24 --> 113.36]  Written on it fell out.
[114.10 --> 116.54]  Unbelievable, which is a word he used all the time.
[117.20 --> 120.38]  It was a note that I had typed on a big clunky manual typewriter.
[120.54 --> 121.30]  Remember those?
[121.88 --> 125.06]  Around 45 or 50 years ago when I was still in high school.
[125.82 --> 127.46]  I had no idea he had kept it.
[127.46 --> 128.36]  It reads,
[130.10 --> 130.72]  Dear Dad,
[131.50 --> 133.38]  Yes, you are a great dad,
[133.68 --> 136.20]  a fantastic dad, underlined fantastic.
[136.96 --> 139.80]  Don't ever think about the world without you.
[140.02 --> 140.58]  I don't.
[141.14 --> 142.86]  The world wouldn't be good without you.
[143.42 --> 145.66]  And not only because you fix things for me,
[146.14 --> 147.66]  which I appreciate with my whole heart,
[147.74 --> 149.02]  but mainly because I love you,
[149.50 --> 151.22]  and you are very important to me.
[152.06 --> 153.98]  The typewriter looks and works great.
[154.16 --> 155.40]  Thanks tons and tons.
[155.98 --> 157.40]  Love, Annette, XXOO.
[161.80 --> 163.50]  Those words still hold true for me.
[163.74 --> 165.26]  No, actually, even more so now.
[165.26 --> 167.66]  We always had a very close relationship,
[167.96 --> 170.02]  which got closer after my mum passed away,
[170.42 --> 171.22]  and he was alone.
[171.84 --> 174.42]  Our lives became even more tightly intertwined
[174.42 --> 175.74]  these past several years
[175.74 --> 177.20]  as he battled dementia,
[177.66 --> 180.72]  and we walked that really difficult road together.
[182.48 --> 185.28]  I'll be forever thankful that he never forgot
[185.28 --> 186.52]  who I and Bill were,
[186.68 --> 188.92]  even though everything else became a blur to him.
[189.76 --> 191.98]  Once in a while, he thought I was his sister, Heiska,
[191.98 --> 195.18]  and was thrilled I had come all the way from Holland
[195.18 --> 195.82]  to visit him.
[196.24 --> 198.00]  But he usually knew I was Annette.
[198.64 --> 201.40]  He was the only person to ever call me by my legal name.
[202.30 --> 204.08]  But even though his mind was fading,
[204.18 --> 206.24]  the one thing that never faded was his smile.
[206.76 --> 208.06]  And he smiled a lot.
[208.68 --> 210.10]  His smile was his trademark.
[210.10 --> 212.26]  Elam even put his smile on their website,
[212.38 --> 213.74]  and he became their poster child.
[214.64 --> 216.12]  Along with that beautiful smile
[216.12 --> 217.60]  came a positive outlook at life,
[218.00 --> 219.24]  always looking at the bright side.
[219.78 --> 221.54]  I particularly loved his laugh,
[221.70 --> 223.12]  especially his little chuckle.
[223.64 --> 224.90]  I'm sure you know which one I mean.
[225.64 --> 228.34]  Finding humour in a situation was second nature to him.
[228.90 --> 231.10]  Finding something in everything was what he did so well.
[231.80 --> 234.06]  This made him an awesome storyteller and writer.
[234.06 --> 236.86]  He could take an average, normal event
[236.86 --> 238.52]  and weave an incredible story.
[239.38 --> 242.16]  So many of these stories are in the book he wrote for the family,
[242.62 --> 243.82]  which we will always treasure.
[245.12 --> 248.22]  And in the hundreds of letters he wrote to people around the world,
[248.40 --> 249.42]  which would get shared,
[249.60 --> 251.94]  and everyone said his letters were the best letters ever.
[252.96 --> 256.50]  When one hearing aid accidentally got flushed down the toilet,
[257.08 --> 260.60]  he wrote to WorkSafe about the journey of the tiny hearing aid
[260.60 --> 265.06]  as it happily bobbed along in the Pacific Ocean on its way to China,
[266.12 --> 270.62]  while its lonely mate sadly remained in his other ear here in Canada.
[271.60 --> 274.32]  The letter was enjoyed so much at WorkSafe,
[274.42 --> 276.58]  they gave him brand new free hearing aids
[276.58 --> 278.78]  together with a warm thank you note.
[280.08 --> 282.54]  Sometimes I wish I'd lived far away so that I'd get a letter,
[283.16 --> 284.74]  but I know what I had was better,
[285.00 --> 286.12]  his presence in my life.
[286.88 --> 288.84]  What always amazed me was his record keeping.
[288.84 --> 290.40]  He wrote everything down.
[290.54 --> 291.82]  If you called, he wrote it down.
[292.22 --> 294.02]  If you sent a Christmas card, he recorded it.
[294.68 --> 297.08]  He used to visit incoming ships in the port of Vancouver
[297.08 --> 298.28]  with the seafarers chaplains,
[298.56 --> 299.76]  and he recorded every visit,
[299.84 --> 301.62]  the size of the ship, the cargo it hauled,
[301.64 --> 303.74]  the people he met, who he'd bring home for a visit,
[304.32 --> 306.38]  every detail in a book that I gave last year
[306.38 --> 308.62]  to the current chaplain, Gary Rosema.
[309.42 --> 312.36]  In the years that he volunteered for the Ladner Food Bank,
[312.42 --> 313.42]  he recorded everything,
[313.48 --> 314.98]  right down to the weight of the potatoes
[314.98 --> 316.32]  he picked up from the burr farm.
[316.32 --> 320.30]  He recorded in detail the medical journey of my mom
[320.30 --> 322.12]  before she passed away, as well as his own.
[322.70 --> 325.18]  He wrote pages of wishes and instructions
[325.18 --> 327.40]  of what to do when he passed away
[327.40 --> 329.44]  and what he would like at his funeral.
[329.76 --> 330.94]  He picked his own songs.
[331.06 --> 332.88]  He picked everything that we are doing today.
[336.78 --> 339.12]  All of which we honored this past week and today.
[339.78 --> 342.86]  He loved details and found all the little things in life
[342.86 --> 344.86]  to be interesting and fun to keep track of.
[345.38 --> 347.26]  His attention to detail served him well
[347.26 --> 349.80]  in his careers and in all the many projects he undertook.
[350.46 --> 352.30]  I have the amazing blueprints he made
[352.30 --> 353.70]  before he built his spoon racks.
[354.28 --> 355.16]  He could build anything,
[355.32 --> 358.28]  including his own infant daughter's grave,
[358.70 --> 361.26]  which also showed his strength of character.
[362.12 --> 364.10]  For my rabbits, he built a miniature replica
[364.10 --> 365.42]  of the house that we lived in.
[366.08 --> 368.00]  And in Bellevue, he and a few others
[368.00 --> 369.26]  built a roadside chapel,
[369.88 --> 372.10]  as seen on the photo on the hall table.
[373.12 --> 374.26]  He could fix anything.
[374.38 --> 376.66]  He could redesign anything to make it more efficient.
[377.20 --> 379.22]  He could play the organ and the trumpet beautifully,
[379.40 --> 381.20]  even though he never had lessons in either.
[382.08 --> 384.04]  As a child, I loved laying in bed at night
[384.04 --> 385.96]  listening to him playing well-known hymns.
[386.64 --> 388.04]  He conducted a church choir,
[388.20 --> 389.90]  led services in senior care homes,
[390.02 --> 391.58]  visited seniors that had no one else,
[391.96 --> 393.58]  was a perpetual elder in church,
[393.58 --> 394.64]  served on school boards,
[395.12 --> 396.24]  was on the counting committee.
[396.54 --> 397.58]  The list is endless.
[398.26 --> 399.26]  He had a servant heart,
[399.40 --> 400.82]  and he used the gifts and talents
[400.82 --> 402.08]  the Lord had blessed him with.
[402.78 --> 404.06]  And that was his motivation,
[404.42 --> 406.58]  his strong, unwavering faith in God.
[407.04 --> 409.52]  He trusted God completely in every circumstance
[409.52 --> 411.92]  and loved and served the Lord with his whole heart.
[412.66 --> 415.12]  He loved talking about spiritual matters,
[415.62 --> 417.40]  about scripture and about God's world.
[418.12 --> 420.08]  Three Saturdays ago, we sat outside,
[420.08 --> 421.66]  and he expressed his awe
[421.66 --> 423.82]  of the beauty of God's creation
[423.82 --> 425.92]  in the blue sky and the changing season.
[426.38 --> 428.94]  He noticed, even with his dementia
[428.94 --> 430.32]  and limited speech.
[431.28 --> 432.32]  While living in Ladner,
[432.42 --> 434.12]  he spent an entire day once
[434.12 --> 435.50]  watching a spider
[435.50 --> 437.52]  spin an intricate web
[437.52 --> 438.66]  between two lampposts
[438.66 --> 441.36]  and marveled at the process
[441.36 --> 442.84]  and at the minute details
[442.84 --> 443.94]  that God had created.
[444.90 --> 446.62]  In Ladner, he spent many hours
[446.62 --> 448.48]  sitting in his absolute favorite spot,
[448.72 --> 450.42]  right outside his back sliding door,
[450.88 --> 452.60]  looking at the fields of the Burr farm.
[453.28 --> 454.26]  He'd watch the tractors,
[454.56 --> 455.94]  watch the traffic on the freeway,
[456.48 --> 457.82]  and knowing I had to go to work,
[457.94 --> 459.18]  would alert me if there was a backup,
[460.00 --> 461.22]  timed and knew the schedules
[461.22 --> 463.54]  of the major airlines flying into YVR.
[463.54 --> 466.80]  Remember, he loved keeping track of things.
[468.92 --> 471.16]  He admired the stunning sunsets
[471.16 --> 472.54]  and watched the lights of the city
[472.54 --> 473.72]  and the ski resorts go on.
[474.10 --> 476.04]  Bill and I spent many happy hours
[476.04 --> 477.06]  sitting there with him,
[477.16 --> 477.74]  having coffee.
[479.10 --> 481.46]  Meals, coffee, talking.
[482.14 --> 484.08]  Oh, and did I mention having coffee?
[484.92 --> 486.60]  Visiting Dad meant drinking coffee,
[487.22 --> 487.86]  gallons of it.
[488.46 --> 489.58]  Good thing we love coffee.
[490.38 --> 491.66]  However, if we were lucky,
[491.74 --> 492.36]  he made fresh.
[494.96 --> 495.92]  But there were times
[495.92 --> 497.20]  when we were served coffee
[497.20 --> 497.92]  from that morning
[497.92 --> 499.38]  or from the night before.
[500.08 --> 501.10]  Not enough in the pot?
[501.36 --> 501.96]  No problem.
[502.54 --> 504.04]  Just add hot water from the tap,
[504.50 --> 506.40]  using the cup he drank from, of course,
[506.84 --> 509.36]  and pour it over the old cold grinds,
[509.84 --> 510.80]  then microwave it.
[512.56 --> 514.90]  And while making this gourmet blend,
[515.24 --> 515.72]  he'd say,
[515.94 --> 517.42]  good enough for Canada.
[517.42 --> 520.30]  We became quite adept
[520.30 --> 521.70]  at me distracting him
[521.70 --> 523.84]  and Bill quickly making a fresh pot.
[524.86 --> 526.22]  The highlight of his week,
[526.32 --> 526.90]  so he said,
[526.96 --> 527.94]  was Friday evenings
[527.94 --> 529.16]  when Bill and I would come over
[529.16 --> 530.04]  and play Tile Rummy
[530.04 --> 530.88]  or Mexican Train.
[531.68 --> 532.94]  I still have the score sheets
[532.94 --> 535.60]  of 22 years of weekly game nights.
[536.54 --> 538.76]  Remember, he loved keeping track of things.
[539.66 --> 541.30]  The first years were quite competitive
[541.30 --> 542.36]  and Dad was super sharp,
[542.66 --> 544.96]  but by 2020, anything went.
[544.96 --> 546.60]  No problem, Dad.
[546.90 --> 547.42]  Go ahead.
[548.00 --> 549.52]  Move your tiles six times
[549.52 --> 550.48]  during Bill's turn.
[551.74 --> 553.22]  Dad made up new rules
[553.22 --> 554.12]  as we'd go along.
[554.74 --> 556.06]  Bill and I would do our very best
[556.06 --> 558.08]  to arrange that he would win sometimes.
[558.96 --> 560.84]  All kinds of cheating was going on
[560.84 --> 562.62]  and we'd laugh so hard.
[563.42 --> 565.02]  He had a great sense of humor, you know?
[565.28 --> 566.08]  And you know something?
[566.86 --> 568.34]  Friday nights became the highlight
[568.34 --> 569.28]  of our week, too.
[570.48 --> 572.44]  Being a widower was hard on Dad,
[572.44 --> 574.50]  but to honor my mom,
[575.16 --> 577.02]  he kept up with the housework pretty good
[577.02 --> 579.34]  and even managed not to kill
[579.34 --> 580.08]  the houseplants
[580.08 --> 581.56]  that mom enjoyed so much.
[582.48 --> 583.58]  Most of them were still,
[583.94 --> 585.84]  sort of, alive
[585.84 --> 588.28]  when he moved into Elam last year.
[589.02 --> 590.80]  His biggest challenge was cooking,
[591.20 --> 592.52]  but he was determined to learn.
[592.86 --> 594.06]  Soup became his specialty
[594.06 --> 597.28]  and it consisted of a huge pot full of water
[597.28 --> 599.00]  with hundreds of meatballs.
[599.00 --> 602.04]  He'd count and report exactly
[602.04 --> 604.04]  how many meatballs he could squeeze
[604.04 --> 606.18]  out of a couple pounds of ground beef.
[607.06 --> 609.24]  Remember, he loved keeping track of things.
[610.08 --> 611.74]  I will always treasure the hours
[611.74 --> 613.28]  we spent together making snert,
[613.86 --> 615.50]  fresh applesauce, casseroles,
[615.60 --> 617.16]  and even lasagna once.
[617.80 --> 618.74]  Too much work, he said.
[619.38 --> 621.48]  He always made it fun doing things together.
[622.46 --> 624.22]  Bradley reminded me just this morning
[624.22 --> 625.10]  of Opa's eggs.
[625.10 --> 627.84]  He'd fry a week's worth at a time,
[628.34 --> 630.16]  just to save time and be efficient.
[631.64 --> 633.04]  The biggest reason, though,
[633.14 --> 635.48]  why being a widower was so hard
[635.48 --> 636.52]  and was missing Mom.
[637.62 --> 639.12]  She was the love of his life
[639.12 --> 641.56]  and I believe a part of him died with her
[641.56 --> 642.80]  the day she passed away.
[643.78 --> 645.16]  Theirs was a beautiful example
[645.16 --> 646.90]  of how a marriage should be,
[647.42 --> 648.58]  a real partnership.
[648.58 --> 651.06]  I loved how much he loved her
[651.06 --> 652.70]  and how well he treated her,
[653.14 --> 654.68]  but it also broke my heart
[654.68 --> 656.32]  to see how much he missed her,
[657.04 --> 659.12]  particularly when his dementia got bad
[659.12 --> 660.90]  and he'd wonder where she was.
[661.86 --> 663.38]  There were times when he thought
[663.38 --> 664.82]  she had just recently passed
[664.82 --> 667.50]  and would start grieving all over again.
[667.50 --> 672.92]  This past year and a half
[672.92 --> 675.24]  were probably the worst years of his life
[675.24 --> 676.96]  as reality slipped away.
[677.72 --> 679.46]  He was isolated for most of it
[679.46 --> 682.58]  and once the restrictions lightened,
[682.96 --> 684.78]  could only see one person, me,
[685.20 --> 686.92]  for only half an hour a week
[686.92 --> 689.78]  for a grand total of two hours a month.
[690.32 --> 692.84]  It was wrong and it was agonizing.
[693.62 --> 695.28]  I was very thankful that at least
[695.28 --> 697.32]  he was in a caring Christian environment.
[698.14 --> 699.68]  As a family, we have nothing
[699.68 --> 702.88]  but appreciation and praise for Elam.
[703.76 --> 705.72]  The staff were kind, warm,
[706.22 --> 707.98]  and took such wonderful care of him.
[708.64 --> 709.68]  They were a godsend.
[711.00 --> 712.64]  There are so many memories of Dad,
[712.78 --> 713.72]  memories of camping,
[714.04 --> 715.30]  crammed in their tent trailer
[715.30 --> 717.04]  with Mom, Dad, Bill, myself,
[717.16 --> 717.78]  our three children,
[718.38 --> 719.74]  and a wet, smelly dog
[719.74 --> 721.38]  because it always rained
[721.38 --> 722.94]  when we went camping with Mom and Dad.
[723.92 --> 724.64]  Good times.
[724.64 --> 726.62]  memories of puzzling with Dad,
[727.18 --> 728.78]  watching him meticulously work
[728.78 --> 729.70]  on his train set,
[730.28 --> 732.38]  and interacting with his grandchildren
[732.38 --> 733.74]  and great-grandchildren.
[734.76 --> 736.32]  Again, the list is endless.
[737.80 --> 739.78]  Some memories I will always cherish
[739.78 --> 741.18]  in my heart and others
[741.18 --> 743.16]  I don't have time to share right now.
[743.96 --> 744.96]  After Mom's funeral,
[745.30 --> 746.66]  he told me I had spoken
[746.66 --> 748.12]  for eight minutes.
[749.34 --> 751.42]  Remember, he loved keeping track of things.
[751.42 --> 754.06]  I'll miss hearing how many minutes
[754.06 --> 754.80]  this has been.
[756.00 --> 757.24]  He was a man of God,
[758.02 --> 760.12]  a man who deeply loved his family
[760.12 --> 761.66]  and whose family, in turn,
[761.88 --> 762.80]  deeply loved him.
[763.64 --> 765.44]  He impacted my life
[765.44 --> 768.16]  more than nearly anyone else ever has,
[768.16 --> 771.30]  and I feel an acute,
[771.76 --> 772.54]  I love that word,
[772.70 --> 774.06]  an acute loss
[774.06 --> 775.26]  with his passing,
[775.74 --> 777.96]  but also profound gratitude
[777.96 --> 779.46]  that I had the privilege
[779.46 --> 780.84]  of being his daughter
[780.84 --> 782.22]  and that he is now
[782.22 --> 783.16]  with the Lord.
[783.16 --> 783.26]  Thank you.
[783.26 --> 797.72]  Thirteen and a half minutes.
[799.40 --> 800.18]  Just saying.
[805.04 --> 805.90]  Dear friends,
[806.40 --> 807.40]  my name is Paul.
[807.56 --> 809.24]  I'm the youngest of the three.
[809.24 --> 811.60]  I'm in sales,
[811.76 --> 812.58]  so my family thought
[812.58 --> 814.12]  I should stand up here.
[816.28 --> 817.20]  It's good to see
[817.20 --> 818.64]  so many of you today.
[819.58 --> 820.38]  It's good to see
[820.38 --> 820.94]  that you could fit
[820.94 --> 821.96]  into your Sunday clothes.
[822.58 --> 823.80]  It was tough, wasn't it?
[824.54 --> 825.52]  I've got to warn you,
[825.72 --> 827.12]  mine was a little tough.
[827.42 --> 828.30]  People in the front row,
[829.04 --> 829.98]  watch out.
[830.86 --> 831.26]  Incoming.
[834.22 --> 835.26]  Thank you all for coming.
[835.48 --> 837.02]  It's nice to see familiar faces.
[837.82 --> 838.90]  It's a tremendous help
[838.90 --> 840.06]  and a support to us
[840.06 --> 841.40]  during this very difficult time.
[842.34 --> 843.28]  A big thank you
[843.28 --> 844.40]  to all of those who traveled.
[845.58 --> 847.32]  A big distance to be here.
[847.56 --> 848.12]  The Islanders
[848.12 --> 849.30]  for actually catching a boat.
[850.50 --> 851.38]  And a big hello
[851.38 --> 852.48]  to the millions
[852.48 --> 853.08]  who are watching
[853.08 --> 853.90]  on the live stream
[853.90 --> 855.72]  back home and in Holland
[855.72 --> 857.88]  and who knows where else.
[858.04 --> 858.48]  Thank you.
[859.10 --> 859.84]  We see you.
[861.96 --> 863.00]  Do get a cup of tea.
[863.06 --> 864.08]  This one's going to take a while.
[864.08 --> 866.36]  My dad and I
[866.36 --> 868.82]  each shared a fear
[868.82 --> 869.66]  of public speaking.
[870.26 --> 870.86]  He would fear
[870.86 --> 872.06]  when I was in front of a crowd
[872.06 --> 873.38]  and I would fear
[873.38 --> 874.60]  when he was in front of a crowd.
[875.70 --> 876.44]  You never knew
[876.44 --> 877.30]  what was going to happen.
[878.04 --> 878.76]  Who can forget
[878.76 --> 879.90]  the line that he started
[879.90 --> 880.86]  his speech with
[880.86 --> 882.42]  at our weddings?
[883.04 --> 884.14]  My son, my son,
[884.22 --> 885.06]  what have you done?
[887.36 --> 888.38]  With this in mind,
[888.68 --> 889.64]  I will do my best
[889.64 --> 890.28]  to honor him
[890.28 --> 891.70]  and keep the zingers
[891.70 --> 892.32]  to a minimum.
[894.44 --> 895.02]  Annette mentioned
[895.02 --> 896.20]  the book my dad wrote.
[897.38 --> 898.14]  This is it.
[899.30 --> 900.22]  560 pages.
[901.34 --> 902.14]  Small font.
[903.06 --> 904.10]  A lot of detail.
[905.56 --> 906.36]  I'm going to read this
[906.36 --> 906.82]  for you now.
[909.22 --> 909.90]  I won't.
[911.38 --> 912.80]  I read it for the first time
[912.80 --> 914.28]  after he passed away.
[914.38 --> 914.98]  I saw the book
[914.98 --> 915.58]  the first time
[915.58 --> 916.00]  and I thought
[916.00 --> 916.88]  I knew all the stories.
[917.48 --> 918.38]  He had told this to us
[918.38 --> 919.04]  so many times
[919.04 --> 921.44]  but I was pleasantly surprised
[921.44 --> 921.94]  that there were
[921.94 --> 922.86]  some new ones in there
[922.86 --> 925.52]  and it was amazing.
[925.70 --> 926.84]  There were some spelling mistakes
[926.84 --> 928.82]  but it was amazing.
[930.02 --> 931.04]  He had an amazing,
[931.48 --> 932.22]  strong faith
[932.22 --> 933.46]  and trust in our Lord
[933.46 --> 934.30]  and he lived it.
[935.58 --> 936.50]  Examples would be
[936.50 --> 937.38]  when he left Holland
[937.38 --> 938.46]  he was by himself
[938.46 --> 939.42]  at the age of 22.
[941.40 --> 942.46]  He moved to the mainland
[942.46 --> 943.22]  with no job.
[945.08 --> 945.66]  He signed,
[945.88 --> 946.40]  oh, sorry,
[946.60 --> 947.40]  moving to the mainland
[947.40 --> 948.06]  from Bellevue
[948.06 --> 948.78]  with no job.
[949.54 --> 950.38]  The first thing he did
[950.38 --> 951.38]  when he arrived in Vancouver
[951.38 --> 952.48]  was sign Annette and Harry
[952.48 --> 953.62]  up for a Christian school.
[955.06 --> 956.80]  He quit a job
[956.80 --> 957.84]  and started a new business
[957.84 --> 958.48]  at 55
[958.48 --> 959.96]  with such risk.
[960.90 --> 961.24]  You see,
[961.30 --> 962.60]  my dad trusted in our Lord
[962.60 --> 964.14]  and the Lord blessed him.
[965.26 --> 965.90]  So often,
[966.02 --> 966.72]  this blessing came
[966.72 --> 968.14]  in the form of people.
[969.02 --> 969.84]  He moved to Canada
[969.84 --> 970.44]  on his own
[970.44 --> 971.40]  and he had the family
[971.40 --> 971.78]  Molama
[971.78 --> 972.50]  to welcome him
[972.50 --> 973.14]  and take him in.
[973.58 --> 974.50]  He went to church
[974.50 --> 975.38]  and there he met
[975.38 --> 976.20]  his future partner,
[976.38 --> 976.62]  Kobe,
[978.04 --> 978.62]  my mom.
[979.28 --> 980.52]  He uprooted our family
[980.52 --> 981.30]  to move out of the
[981.30 --> 982.08]  Crow's Nest Pass
[982.08 --> 983.36]  in search of a better future
[983.36 --> 984.78]  with no job.
[985.34 --> 986.04]  What did he do
[986.04 --> 987.06]  when he arrived in Vancouver?
[987.46 --> 988.70]  He enrolled Annette in school
[988.70 --> 989.72]  and then he went
[989.72 --> 990.68]  looking for a job.
[991.68 --> 992.96]  He had one the next day
[992.96 --> 993.84]  when a kind woman
[993.84 --> 994.96]  at the employment office
[994.96 --> 995.48]  in Vancouver
[995.48 --> 997.42]  suggested he go to
[997.42 --> 998.18]  LB and Lumber
[998.18 --> 999.50]  as they sometimes hired
[999.50 --> 1000.10]  without listing
[1000.10 --> 1000.88]  at their office.
[1000.88 --> 1003.64]  Later on in his life,
[1003.70 --> 1004.56]  he decided to start
[1004.56 --> 1005.24]  his own business
[1005.24 --> 1006.36]  when he was in his 50s.
[1007.10 --> 1007.94]  He did not have
[1007.94 --> 1008.78]  much startup money
[1008.78 --> 1010.04]  and needed to have
[1010.04 --> 1010.76]  some dyes made
[1010.76 --> 1011.82]  to extrude the supports.
[1012.82 --> 1013.64]  He met a man,
[1013.72 --> 1014.18]  Bruno Meyer,
[1014.28 --> 1014.98]  who offered to do
[1014.98 --> 1016.20]  the work at a great price
[1016.20 --> 1017.24]  and he wouldn't require
[1017.24 --> 1017.74]  payment
[1017.74 --> 1019.36]  until 10 greenhouses
[1019.36 --> 1020.00]  were sold.
[1021.40 --> 1022.16]  Then when Dad's
[1022.16 --> 1023.34]  greenhouses were in production,
[1023.46 --> 1024.04]  my dad met
[1024.04 --> 1024.84]  Bill Van Der Zand
[1024.84 --> 1026.40]  who owned Fantasy Gardens.
[1026.90 --> 1027.60]  He offered Dad
[1027.60 --> 1028.48]  a prime spot
[1028.48 --> 1029.58]  near the entrance
[1029.58 --> 1030.22]  to the garden
[1030.22 --> 1031.00]  to display
[1031.00 --> 1031.86]  and sell his greenhouse
[1031.86 --> 1032.62]  for no fee.
[1038.20 --> 1038.72]  Sorry.
[1043.60 --> 1044.74]  I lost my spot.
[1045.86 --> 1046.58]  Shortly thereafter,
[1046.76 --> 1047.20]  along comes
[1047.20 --> 1048.26]  Millen Illich
[1048.26 --> 1048.60]  and orders
[1048.60 --> 1049.38]  eight greenhouses
[1049.38 --> 1050.54]  for his family members
[1050.54 --> 1051.76]  without conditions
[1051.76 --> 1052.98]  and payment up front.
[1053.66 --> 1054.46]  An amazing order
[1054.46 --> 1055.46]  for a startup business.
[1056.24 --> 1056.48]  You see,
[1056.56 --> 1057.16]  God trusted
[1057.16 --> 1057.78]  and God,
[1058.12 --> 1058.90]  Dad trusted
[1058.90 --> 1059.74]  and God provided.
[1060.56 --> 1061.42]  There are many stories
[1061.42 --> 1061.96]  like this.
[1062.16 --> 1062.76]  I read the book
[1062.76 --> 1063.36]  and was amazed
[1063.36 --> 1064.60]  at the people in his life
[1064.60 --> 1065.74]  that cared for him
[1065.74 --> 1066.78]  and helped him along the way.
[1067.74 --> 1068.74]  My sister Annette
[1068.74 --> 1069.66]  and brother-in-law Bill
[1069.66 --> 1070.82]  are also such people.
[1071.74 --> 1072.62]  They took such care
[1072.62 --> 1073.20]  of my dad
[1073.20 --> 1074.06]  from playing games
[1074.06 --> 1074.82]  on Friday nights
[1074.82 --> 1075.54]  in the early days
[1075.54 --> 1077.04]  to caring for his daily needs.
[1077.68 --> 1078.72]  They were always there
[1078.72 --> 1079.24]  for him.
[1080.24 --> 1081.12]  Thank you, sis
[1081.12 --> 1082.04]  and brother.
[1083.04 --> 1083.96]  I wasn't always
[1083.96 --> 1084.78]  so nice to him.
[1086.24 --> 1087.44]  In my early teens
[1087.44 --> 1088.12]  one evening,
[1088.32 --> 1089.60]  my dad came into my room.
[1089.82 --> 1090.52]  He sat at the edge
[1090.52 --> 1091.06]  of my bed
[1091.06 --> 1091.52]  and said,
[1092.22 --> 1093.46]  it's time we talk
[1093.46 --> 1094.08]  about the birds
[1094.08 --> 1094.66]  and the bees.
[1095.78 --> 1097.06]  I sat up and said,
[1097.40 --> 1097.90]  sure, Dad.
[1097.98 --> 1098.86]  What would you like to know?
[1100.92 --> 1101.64]  It's true.
[1103.32 --> 1104.78]  He stormed out of my room
[1104.78 --> 1106.44]  and we never discussed it again.
[1106.44 --> 1109.80]  I knew how to push his buttons.
[1110.80 --> 1112.08]  I have such fond memories
[1112.08 --> 1113.24]  of my dad growing up.
[1113.52 --> 1114.46]  The amazing train set
[1114.46 --> 1115.54]  he built below our kitchen.
[1116.04 --> 1117.04]  Best toy ever.
[1118.08 --> 1118.90]  He would take me
[1118.90 --> 1120.20]  on to the CN train station
[1120.20 --> 1121.20]  downtown Vancouver
[1121.20 --> 1122.52]  to visit the model railroad
[1122.52 --> 1123.14]  upstairs.
[1124.88 --> 1125.98]  We would spend hours
[1125.98 --> 1127.30]  just watching the trains go by.
[1128.06 --> 1128.60]  He would take me
[1128.60 --> 1129.10]  to the airport
[1129.10 --> 1129.70]  and we would sit
[1129.70 --> 1130.20]  and we would watch
[1130.20 --> 1131.20]  airplanes come and go.
[1131.96 --> 1132.64]  We would watch
[1132.64 --> 1133.48]  Hockey Night in Canada
[1133.48 --> 1134.42]  every Saturday night
[1134.42 --> 1135.26]  and during the break
[1135.26 --> 1136.56]  we would play hockey
[1136.56 --> 1137.08]  in the basement
[1137.08 --> 1138.44]  with homemade hockey sticks.
[1139.14 --> 1140.34]  Harry and I versus Dad.
[1141.10 --> 1142.22]  A lot of sore shins
[1142.22 --> 1143.26]  in the third period
[1143.26 --> 1144.00]  that was for sure.
[1145.48 --> 1146.50]  I have another story
[1146.50 --> 1147.44]  of my dad in action.
[1147.94 --> 1149.02]  In order to get his approval
[1149.02 --> 1150.36]  to jump off the diving boards
[1150.36 --> 1151.18]  at Centennial Pool
[1151.18 --> 1151.62]  in Richmond
[1151.62 --> 1153.20]  I had to prove to him
[1153.20 --> 1154.12]  I could swim safely
[1154.12 --> 1154.88]  across the width
[1154.88 --> 1155.40]  of the pool.
[1156.14 --> 1157.26]  I was just a little guy
[1157.26 --> 1158.82]  and proceeded to dog paddle
[1158.82 --> 1159.68]  across the pool.
[1160.48 --> 1161.62]  I made it across
[1161.62 --> 1163.22]  and proceeded to swim back.
[1163.78 --> 1165.04]  Well, I didn't make it.
[1165.26 --> 1166.48]  I started to tire
[1166.48 --> 1167.44]  and I sank.
[1168.08 --> 1168.92]  Next thing you know
[1168.92 --> 1169.68]  I'm on the deck
[1169.68 --> 1170.84]  spitting out water.
[1171.36 --> 1172.14]  Dad had to jump
[1172.14 --> 1173.04]  over the tall fence
[1173.04 --> 1173.68]  and pull me out
[1173.68 --> 1174.18]  of the water.
[1175.10 --> 1175.86]  He saved me
[1175.86 --> 1176.90]  from drowning that day.
[1177.98 --> 1178.82]  The next week
[1178.82 --> 1180.04]  I'm in swim lessons.
[1182.44 --> 1183.34]  Last Thursday
[1183.34 --> 1184.84]  at around 2 a.m.
[1184.84 --> 1189.94]  we sat next to my dad
[1189.94 --> 1190.36]  at Elam.
[1191.42 --> 1192.64]  His breaths were slowing.
[1193.46 --> 1194.56]  His eyes were closed.
[1195.26 --> 1196.60]  I was holding his hand
[1196.60 --> 1197.54]  and it was truly
[1197.54 --> 1198.68]  a profound moment.
[1199.50 --> 1200.44]  His life flashed
[1200.44 --> 1201.00]  in front of me.
[1201.86 --> 1202.74]  I saw him holding
[1202.74 --> 1203.66]  my hand in church
[1203.66 --> 1204.42]  with a peppermint
[1204.42 --> 1204.98]  and a cigarette
[1204.98 --> 1205.66]  in his hand.
[1206.66 --> 1207.70]  I saw him lying
[1207.70 --> 1208.20]  on the floor
[1208.20 --> 1208.90]  of the living room
[1208.90 --> 1210.28]  tending to a sore back.
[1210.28 --> 1212.44]  I saw him walking
[1212.44 --> 1213.96]  around our old house
[1213.96 --> 1215.38]  wearing a sharp blue suit
[1215.38 --> 1216.40]  whistling
[1216.40 --> 1217.62]  and tending to the garden.
[1218.84 --> 1219.96]  Such good memories.
[1220.78 --> 1221.94]  He then passed away
[1221.94 --> 1222.90]  to be with our Lord.
[1223.70 --> 1224.46]  Thank you, Dad.
[1224.46 --> 1238.32]  Hello.
[1250.94 --> 1252.42]  Hello.
[1252.42 --> 1257.98]  So, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Kevin Verbeek.
[1258.48 --> 1261.90]  I'm the oldest grandson of Gert Vanemelen, my Opa.
[1263.24 --> 1267.88]  My Opa was a great man who had a wonderful life and raised a wonderful family.
[1269.10 --> 1273.76]  He always looked out for others and was always there for you if you needed him for anything.
[1275.22 --> 1280.02]  I was really close to my Opa and Oma growing up and had the privilege of living close to them
[1280.02 --> 1282.14]  so I could see them quite often.
[1283.42 --> 1287.08]  After my Oma passed away back in 2001, it was hard for my Opa,
[1288.02 --> 1290.56]  but he stayed strong and faithful to the Lord throughout.
[1291.98 --> 1295.26]  Over the years, I grew closer and closer to my Opa
[1295.26 --> 1300.44]  and had so many great times and had many great memories being with him.
[1302.10 --> 1305.34]  I loved spending the weekends and evenings at his house,
[1305.98 --> 1307.92]  playing games, watching hockey together.
[1308.52 --> 1311.64]  He always made me feel welcome and loved hanging out with me.
[1312.42 --> 1318.36]  He was one of my greater supporters and he told me I could achieve anything I put my mind to.
[1318.36 --> 1323.28]  I know it is true because he's achieved so many things in his life,
[1323.42 --> 1326.38]  including his biggest, which was his greenhouse business.
[1326.38 --> 1331.68]  He was a courageous man who taught me the importance of discipline and hard work.
[1331.68 --> 1337.94]  He and I shared a special bond and to me, he was one of my best friends.
[1337.94 --> 1343.04]  I hung out and chatted with him the same way I would if I was hanging out with a buddy of mine.
[1343.04 --> 1346.24]  We would talk about things going on in the world.
[1346.24 --> 1350.68]  We would talk about work, faith, basically everything under the sun.
[1350.68 --> 1356.30]  We would even talk about girls that I was interested in at the time.
[1356.30 --> 1358.62]  And he would call me out if the girl wasn't right for me.
[1358.62 --> 1362.62]  Or if he thought I was not the smartest when it came down to certain life decisions.
[1362.62 --> 1367.54]  We always looked out for each other and tried to keep each other happy,
[1367.54 --> 1371.64]  which was pretty easy with my OPA as we laughed often and never had a dull moment.
[1371.64 --> 1385.76]  I looked up to him and the way he was, especially when it came down to his faith life.
[1386.68 --> 1390.90]  He was always diligent in reading the Bible and doing devotions.
[1391.82 --> 1396.22]  I remember many times I would come over, walk into the house and to the kitchen,
[1396.22 --> 1402.90]  as he didn't hear the doorbell or me knocking on the door countless times.
[1404.22 --> 1408.06]  As I would enter the kitchen, I could see him at the table with his plate to the side,
[1408.70 --> 1412.42]  Bible and devotion book in front of him, and he would be immersed into it.
[1413.86 --> 1418.30]  Scared him a few times as he had no idea I was there, but he was overjoyed when he saw me.
[1419.20 --> 1422.08]  We would then joke around, play rummy, have coffee,
[1422.08 --> 1427.50]  which for many, many years happened at least once a week, but more often was more than once a week.
[1429.98 --> 1433.58]  He would talk about when he was growing up and the many stories he had,
[1434.54 --> 1438.12]  one of which was the way he met Myoma and the love he felt for her.
[1439.20 --> 1443.62]  He explained how he went driving, and as he passed the place Myoma was working,
[1444.38 --> 1449.58]  even though he couldn't see her, he could see her shaking out a bed sheet at the top of the window,
[1450.16 --> 1454.66]  and he knew it was her, and his heart would be pounding and skipping beats.
[1456.20 --> 1461.68]  He loved talking about her and could see it in his face as it would always light up like crazy when he did.
[1463.04 --> 1467.80]  The love he had for Myoma was always strong and never faltered, even until the day he died.
[1467.80 --> 1473.68]  Myoma, as you've been hearing, is a pretty funny guy.
[1474.80 --> 1479.24]  Almost every time we came over to his house, he usually had some sort of joke or riddle to share with.
[1480.60 --> 1484.14]  One time we came over, as we entered the house, he asked us,
[1484.36 --> 1488.62]  if an electric train is going north and the wind is blowing south, which way is the smoke blowing?
[1490.18 --> 1493.56]  Once we thought about it for a second, we laughed when figuring it out.
[1494.76 --> 1497.58]  He was also very enthusiastic when it came to storytelling.
[1497.80 --> 1502.46]  As his grandson, I can only hope to tell the stories half as well as he did.
[1504.84 --> 1510.98]  Some of the stories that I shared of him growing up showed a different side to Myopa that I wasn't used to.
[1511.82 --> 1516.56]  He would share stories like when he would tell his parents that he was too sick to go to church on a Sunday,
[1517.30 --> 1520.24]  and then would sneak out and go to watch the local soccer game,
[1520.96 --> 1524.34]  and make it back before his parents and the rest of his family would come home,
[1524.34 --> 1528.76]  but then would literally feel sick to his stomach afterwards for lying to his parents.
[1530.88 --> 1533.80]  He grew up in a large family, which sounds like they all got along.
[1534.62 --> 1537.86]  Especially the last few years, they all wrote letters to each other all the time,
[1538.60 --> 1541.18]  as emails and technology were too much for Myopa.
[1542.12 --> 1545.28]  He loved his typewriter, though, and it got him by quite nicely.
[1545.28 --> 1554.06]  Myopa was very generous with his time, especially when it came to helping others.
[1554.64 --> 1559.10]  I recall many times going with him in his car over to the farm behind his house
[1559.10 --> 1563.96]  and picking up bags of potatoes and bringing them over to the local food bank,
[1564.56 --> 1568.68]  where as soon as he showed up, everyone knew who he was and was very happy to see him.
[1568.68 --> 1574.54]  He helped out a lot in the church, and when it came down to something needed to be done,
[1575.02 --> 1578.16]  or somewhere to be, for us grandkids, he was there.
[1579.08 --> 1584.46]  Always there for birthdays, school events, and without fail, every Christmas,
[1584.64 --> 1588.10]  being part of our big extended family Christmas gatherings.
[1588.10 --> 1596.22]  Him and I, in the early years, would work in the garden, do landscaping around his place,
[1597.16 --> 1600.10]  and as time went on, turned into me doing more of the work,
[1600.40 --> 1602.50]  and him telling me how and what to do.
[1603.50 --> 1605.68]  But he always loved having me there, helping him out.
[1607.26 --> 1611.32]  He and I worked on a few projects in his garage, fixing things around his place,
[1611.82 --> 1615.42]  and whenever something was done, but not quite as well as it should have,
[1615.42 --> 1619.18]  but it still worked, he would always use the phrase, good enough for Canada,
[1620.40 --> 1622.62]  a phrase which I now keep using to this day,
[1622.70 --> 1626.36]  which is always fun explaining to people when they ask why I say it.
[1628.80 --> 1631.14]  There are many fond memories that I could share with my opa,
[1632.42 --> 1636.64]  one of which is coming over with a full tall jar of pickled herring,
[1637.46 --> 1640.52]  and him and I would polish off the whole jar in one sitting
[1640.52 --> 1643.68]  while playing games and chatting and drinking coffee.
[1643.68 --> 1645.96]  It happened more than once.
[1648.46 --> 1654.70]  I could talk for hours about my opa and his life and who he was.
[1655.54 --> 1659.70]  It was an honor and privilege to know him and to see who he truly was.
[1663.00 --> 1667.12]  I'm going to miss him a lot, and the world won't be the same without him there.
[1667.12 --> 1672.64]  But I know he's also in a better place, and he got to spend his last birthday
[1672.64 --> 1676.44]  this past Sunday with my Oma and the Lord, and that is very special.
[1678.02 --> 1681.88]  I always knew if I needed something, I could count on my grandfather.
[1682.84 --> 1686.90]  He was an incredible role model, and he had an incredible heart and spirit.
[1686.90 --> 1690.36]  I loved him and will always remember him.
[1691.36 --> 1691.90]  Thank you.
[1701.00 --> 1703.98]  Good afternoon, friends and family of Gert.
[1704.68 --> 1707.66]  My name is Nicholas Vannermielen, Gert's youngest grandson,
[1707.66 --> 1713.18]  and I'm simply going to be sharing some of my favorite memories with my opa.
[1715.02 --> 1718.10]  Opus house was always warm, literally, and inviting.
[1719.28 --> 1722.00]  He would always open the door with a big smile on his face,
[1722.30 --> 1725.60]  followed by a warm hug and an invitation in for cookies and coffee.
[1725.60 --> 1729.54]  There are pictures of Opa and I playing with Legos,
[1729.76 --> 1732.12]  and he would be following the instructions while rolling a smoke,
[1732.66 --> 1736.68]  and I would be on the other side of the table building something much better,
[1737.18 --> 1740.78]  with my shirt off because he had the fireplace roaring in the middle of June.
[1742.40 --> 1744.92]  Both of us completely content in each other's company.
[1746.28 --> 1749.14]  My cousins and I spent many hours at that house in Ladner,
[1750.14 --> 1753.88]  playing shuffleboard or playing chess with Opa.
[1753.88 --> 1759.20]  On nice days, we would be in the backyard amongst his garden and big oak tree
[1759.20 --> 1760.86]  where the bald eagles nested.
[1761.48 --> 1762.12]  He would say,
[1762.88 --> 1764.94]  the eagles like it better in Canada than America.
[1766.58 --> 1769.02]  And I actually believed that the eagles cared
[1769.02 --> 1770.70]  what health plan they were covered under.
[1772.72 --> 1776.52]  I can remember laughing on the patio with expired Diet Coke in hand,
[1777.08 --> 1780.08]  enjoying the family's company, and Opa talking to one of his grandchildren.
[1780.08 --> 1784.60]  Every Sunday morning, after a night at Opa's house,
[1784.76 --> 1787.08]  was followed by a swift 10 a.m. church service.
[1787.94 --> 1789.68]  We would all climb into this smokesmobile,
[1790.10 --> 1791.70]  also known as his grey Oldsmobile,
[1792.08 --> 1794.58]  which had yellow haze on all the windows,
[1795.40 --> 1798.04]  the most comfortable all-red cloth interior,
[1798.04 --> 1801.26]  and, of course, cigarette butts in the ashtray,
[1802.00 --> 1803.92]  perfect for after-Sunday school naps,
[1804.30 --> 1805.90]  dressing our Sunday bests,
[1805.90 --> 1807.42]  which Opa took very seriously.
[1808.64 --> 1809.56]  Everywhere Gert went,
[1809.96 --> 1811.28]  a clean press suit followed,
[1812.02 --> 1813.98]  whether that would be a Timbit soccer game
[1813.98 --> 1815.12]  in his wool suit,
[1815.82 --> 1817.58]  or all the way to Ladner to Victoria
[1817.58 --> 1818.14]  for Leah
[1818.14 --> 1820.80]  and my grandparents' day
[1820.80 --> 1821.82]  at our school,
[1822.18 --> 1823.20]  wearing a suit, of course,
[1823.20 --> 1826.36]  or birthdays
[1826.36 --> 1830.46]  sorry
[1830.46 --> 1842.68]  or birthdays
[1842.68 --> 1844.94]  where he would let us choose any toy
[1844.94 --> 1847.66]  sorry, apologies
[1847.66 --> 1860.60]  sorry
[1860.60 --> 1863.28]  any toy that he would let us pick out
[1863.28 --> 1865.52]  and then spend time in the backyard
[1865.52 --> 1866.66]  playing with the new gift
[1866.66 --> 1874.62]  some of my fondest memories
[1877.66 --> 1899.38]  or constructing various things with my Opa.
[1900.16 --> 1901.42]  He would spend countless hours
[1901.42 --> 1902.26]  at the kitchen table
[1902.26 --> 1902.96]  or in the garage
[1902.96 --> 1903.78]  at his workbench
[1903.78 --> 1904.72]  playing with Lego,
[1905.30 --> 1906.02]  rolling smokes,
[1906.02 --> 1907.16]  or building birdhouses.
[1908.20 --> 1909.30]  My Opa taught me a lot
[1909.30 --> 1910.44]  but one of the lessons
[1910.44 --> 1911.44]  that really stuck with me
[1911.44 --> 1914.86]  was the saying he would say to me all the time
[1914.86 --> 1917.02]  use the right tool for the right job.
[1917.92 --> 1919.24]  He said this in context
[1919.24 --> 1920.34]  to one of my first times
[1920.34 --> 1921.70]  that he let me
[1921.70 --> 1924.08]  at his workbench by myself.
[1924.92 --> 1925.94]  Taking this to heart
[1925.94 --> 1927.14]  I started off the project
[1927.14 --> 1928.14]  by using a saw
[1928.14 --> 1929.10]  to hammer
[1929.10 --> 1930.06]  in some nails
[1930.06 --> 1931.24]  into a piece of wood.
[1931.92 --> 1933.08]  It took the strength
[1933.08 --> 1934.18]  of a seven-year-old boy
[1934.18 --> 1935.16]  about five minutes
[1935.16 --> 1936.12]  to break the saw
[1936.12 --> 1938.16]  and deem it completely useless.
[1939.28 --> 1939.68]  Horrified
[1939.68 --> 1940.88]  and remembering the stories
[1940.88 --> 1941.88]  my dad had told me
[1941.88 --> 1942.72]  what his father did
[1942.72 --> 1943.74]  when he got in trouble
[1943.74 --> 1945.00]  I was scared
[1945.00 --> 1946.52]  of what my Opa was going to say.
[1947.20 --> 1949.12]  He opened the door to the garage
[1949.12 --> 1950.68]  and saw the broken tools
[1950.68 --> 1951.88]  on his workbench.
[1952.70 --> 1953.70]  He looked at me
[1953.70 --> 1954.78]  and then the saw
[1954.78 --> 1955.48]  and said
[1955.48 --> 1957.06]  it's okay my boy
[1957.06 --> 1958.60]  and patted my back.
[1959.18 --> 1960.36]  He then showed me
[1960.36 --> 1961.24]  that a hammer
[1961.24 --> 1962.36]  would have been a better choice
[1962.36 --> 1963.06]  and helped me
[1963.06 --> 1964.46]  with the rest of my project.
[1966.44 --> 1967.40]  I'm very pleased
[1967.40 --> 1968.62]  that my Opa was so kind
[1968.62 --> 1969.52]  giving, gentle
[1969.52 --> 1970.16]  and compassionate
[1970.16 --> 1971.18]  and altogether
[1971.18 --> 1972.16]  an amazing Opa.
[1972.96 --> 1973.96]  He's looking down
[1973.96 --> 1974.84]  on us all today
[1974.84 --> 1976.58]  as we celebrate his life.
[1977.32 --> 1977.96]  Thank you
[1977.96 --> 1978.60]  from Nicholas.
[1981.18 --> 1981.62]  Thank you.
[1981.62 --> 1993.74]  Annette and Paul
[1993.74 --> 1995.12]  and Kevin and Nicholas
[1995.12 --> 1996.30]  thank you for sharing those words.
[1997.18 --> 1998.16]  Let's all stand now
[1998.16 --> 2000.36]  and let's sing
[2000.36 --> 2001.96]  two more songs together
[2001.96 --> 2002.74]  praise the Lord
[2002.74 --> 2003.64]  with the sound of trumpet
[2003.64 --> 2004.94]  and all hail
[2004.94 --> 2006.62]  the power of Jesus name.
[2006.84 --> 2007.36]  Let's rise.
[2007.36 --> 2007.42]  Let's rise.
[2011.62 --> 2015.06]  praise the Lord
[2015.06 --> 2016.12]  my son
[2016.12 --> 2017.66]  to him
[2017.66 --> 2018.46]  praise the Lord
[2018.46 --> 2018.50]  and get reared
[2018.50 --> 2019.30]  giver
[2019.30 --> 2020.30]  with the sound of trumpet
[2020.30 --> 2020.86]  and glad
[2020.86 --> 2021.48]  be with the sound of trumpet
[2021.48 --> 2022.34]  in love
[2022.34 --> 2023.44]  pause in love
[2023.44 --> 2024.40]  and hear themusi
[2024.40 --> 2025.16]  in the birth of Jesus name.
[2025.16 --> 2026.30]  la Toward
[2026.30 --> 2026.82]  applause

[2331.82 --> 2332.82]  Amen.
[2332.82 --> 2333.82]  Amen.
[2333.82 --> 2335.82]  You may be seated.
[2335.82 --> 2346.82]  Would you pray with me as we come before the Lord to hear his word of Scripture to us this
[2346.82 --> 2347.82]  afternoon?
[2347.82 --> 2355.44]  Eternal God, our Heavenly Father, you alone can turn the shadow of death into the brightness
[2355.44 --> 2357.60]  of morning light.
[2357.60 --> 2362.82]  Help us now to turn to you with reverent and believing hearts.
[2362.82 --> 2370.24]  Lord, speak to us of eternal things so that hearing the promises of Scripture we may have
[2370.24 --> 2371.24]  hope.
[2371.24 --> 2373.70]  We pray through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2373.70 --> 2374.70]  Amen.
[2374.70 --> 2384.80]  So, Gert asked us to read Psalm 46.
[2384.80 --> 2386.16]  So I will read it for us.
[2386.16 --> 2389.78]  We'll have the words here on the screen.
[2389.78 --> 2394.46]  God is our refuge and strength and ever-present help in trouble.
[2394.46 --> 2398.58]  Therefore we will not fear though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart
[2398.58 --> 2399.98]  of the sea.
[2399.98 --> 2405.00]  Though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
[2405.00 --> 2408.80]  There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God.
[2408.80 --> 2411.88]  The holy place where the Most High dwells.
[2411.88 --> 2413.08]  God is within her.
[2413.08 --> 2414.84]  She will not fall.
[2414.84 --> 2418.28]  God will help her at break of day.
[2418.28 --> 2419.68]  Nations are in uproar.
[2419.68 --> 2421.20]  Kingdoms fall.
[2421.20 --> 2422.96]  He lifts his voice.
[2422.96 --> 2426.78]  The Lord Almighty is with us.
[2426.78 --> 2430.68]  The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[2430.68 --> 2433.06]  Come and see what the Lord has done.
[2433.06 --> 2435.84]  The desolations he has brought on the earth.
[2435.84 --> 2439.44]  He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.
[2439.44 --> 2442.32]  He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[2442.32 --> 2445.16]  He burns the shields with fire.
[2445.16 --> 2450.18]  He says, be still and know that I am God.
[2450.18 --> 2452.92]  I will be exalted among the nations.
[2452.92 --> 2455.98]  I will be exalted in the earth.
[2455.98 --> 2458.02]  The Lord Almighty is with us.
[2458.02 --> 2461.34]  The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[2461.34 --> 2465.62]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2465.62 --> 2470.48]  So I never had the honor of meeting Gert.
[2470.48 --> 2472.98]  But I know I would have really liked him.
[2472.98 --> 2478.30]  I know that because Annette and Bill shared with me and Paul last Saturday when we met,
[2478.30 --> 2485.08]  shared with me about his life and how he cared for and loved his family, how he served so faithfully in church council.
[2485.08 --> 2487.64]  Of course, I would appreciate that.
[2488.36 --> 2494.84]  But what I was really just astounded by was in his last will and testament,
[2495.22 --> 2501.14]  he even left personal instructions for the minister who would officiate his memorial service.
[2501.14 --> 2504.02]  So I want to share that with you.
[2504.02 --> 2506.46]  This is what he wrote.
[2506.46 --> 2512.74]  Our favorite text for mom and me always was what is already on the gravestone.
[2512.74 --> 2515.86]  Be still and know that I am God.
[2515.86 --> 2522.78]  The serving minister will, of course, have the privilege and freedom to use this text for the graveside service
[2522.78 --> 2525.66]  or the whole psalm during the church service following.
[2525.66 --> 2535.00]  As mom and me always loved the greatness of God in this whole psalm and the comfort it gives to his children.
[2536.22 --> 2537.38]  So that was his message.
[2537.48 --> 2542.08]  He gave me the great freedom to use this text in the service or at the graveside service.
[2542.16 --> 2543.08]  So I chose this service.
[2543.08 --> 2547.96]  And he had in bold two phrases.
[2548.48 --> 2551.58]  The greatness of God and the word comfort.
[2552.54 --> 2553.86]  Greatness of God and comfort.
[2554.58 --> 2557.84]  And then further down he also had in bold, keep it simple.
[2558.96 --> 2560.50]  With an exclamation point.
[2561.54 --> 2562.40]  So I like that.
[2563.46 --> 2565.76]  And I do want to keep it simple this morning.
[2565.76 --> 2572.36]  You know, but I think these instructions that he gave me kind of revealed the kind of man he was,
[2572.40 --> 2574.44]  as we've heard from these memories already.
[2575.38 --> 2581.30]  And he wanted to serve me and to serve all of us in providing these instructions
[2581.30 --> 2583.96]  to help me to know what is on his heart
[2583.96 --> 2590.98]  and for me to know the message that he wanted all of us to hear and to believe,
[2591.44 --> 2595.06]  which is that God is great and that he comforts his children.
[2595.76 --> 2598.82]  And friends, that is what Psalm 46 is all about.
[2598.94 --> 2603.64]  It teaches us to rest and put our trust and our hope in God,
[2603.92 --> 2608.12]  who is our comfort and our strength.
[2609.32 --> 2614.90]  So just for a moment, I want to invite us now to rest in the strength of God
[2614.90 --> 2619.36]  and to rest in the comfort that he provides us.
[2620.72 --> 2625.42]  First, Psalm 46 reveals to us a God who is great.
[2625.76 --> 2628.02]  Again, verses 1 and 2 tell us,
[2628.14 --> 2630.84]  God is our refuge and our strength,
[2631.92 --> 2635.58]  an ever-present help in times of trouble.
[2636.48 --> 2638.68]  Therefore, it says, we will not fear,
[2639.38 --> 2642.52]  for the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[2643.82 --> 2647.76]  See, this psalm acknowledges to us that in this life we will have trouble.
[2647.76 --> 2656.52]  Sometimes the circumstances that we face can feel like the earth is giving way.
[2657.52 --> 2661.38]  You know, especially when someone whom we love dies,
[2661.50 --> 2665.50]  that person who in your life was a rock to you,
[2666.06 --> 2670.10]  the person who gave you stability and who you could rely on,
[2670.42 --> 2673.34]  suddenly when that person is gone, it feels like the earth is giving way.
[2673.34 --> 2679.16]  And for those, of course, who knew and loved Gert,
[2679.32 --> 2681.30]  maybe I can imagine it could feel that way.
[2682.26 --> 2684.08]  But friends, Jesus told us this.
[2684.68 --> 2685.36]  Jesus told us,
[2685.52 --> 2687.18]  In this world you will have trouble,
[2688.06 --> 2691.02]  but take heart, I have overcome the world.
[2692.16 --> 2696.04]  Friends, the good news is that everything we fear in life,
[2696.84 --> 2697.78]  Jesus has overcome.
[2697.78 --> 2700.86]  Jesus has even risen from the grave.
[2701.00 --> 2703.28]  He has overcome death itself.
[2704.28 --> 2706.02]  And that means that in Jesus,
[2706.70 --> 2708.88]  the God who created the heavens and the earth,
[2709.28 --> 2713.22]  can be our strength and our refuge.
[2714.58 --> 2715.90]  So God is great.
[2717.00 --> 2718.12]  But not only that,
[2718.24 --> 2722.68]  not only is he powerful enough for us to rest in and find refuge in,
[2722.72 --> 2725.12]  and he invites us to take refuge in him,
[2725.12 --> 2727.76]  he also is present with us.
[2728.70 --> 2731.72]  Verse 1 says he's an ever-present help in trouble.
[2732.22 --> 2733.42]  He's always there for us.
[2734.18 --> 2737.80]  Verse 7 says the Lord Almighty is with us.
[2738.68 --> 2740.88]  And that's one of the big ideas in this psalm,
[2740.96 --> 2742.64]  is that God is with us.
[2743.22 --> 2744.50]  He dwells with us.
[2745.42 --> 2746.32]  And for the Christian,
[2746.82 --> 2750.00]  he has sent his Holy Spirit to be with us,
[2750.04 --> 2751.18]  the presence of God,
[2751.72 --> 2752.90]  even in our hearts.
[2752.90 --> 2754.02]  In the Gospel of John,
[2754.12 --> 2755.28]  Jesus said to his disciples,
[2755.76 --> 2756.74]  I will ask the Father,
[2756.98 --> 2759.36]  and he will give you another advocate to help you
[2759.36 --> 2760.72]  and be with you forever,
[2760.92 --> 2761.84]  the Spirit of truth.
[2762.38 --> 2764.98]  For he lives with you and will be in you.
[2766.32 --> 2767.70]  So God is with us.
[2769.28 --> 2770.32]  He's not saying,
[2770.80 --> 2772.90]  I'm there and you need to go find me somewhere
[2773.48 --> 2775.14]  because I'm far away from you.
[2775.40 --> 2776.30]  That's not what it says.
[2776.54 --> 2780.08]  Psalm 46 tells us that he is present.
[2780.78 --> 2781.66]  He is with us.
[2781.66 --> 2784.68]  God is our refuge and our strength,
[2785.26 --> 2786.70]  a very present help in trouble.
[2787.44 --> 2788.96]  So what God is saying to us,
[2789.60 --> 2791.82]  and I think what Gert is saying to us through this psalm,
[2791.92 --> 2795.50]  is that even in these times and circumstances of trouble,
[2796.20 --> 2799.56]  that's where I am present with you.
[2800.38 --> 2802.20]  In the place where you are most afraid,
[2802.30 --> 2803.24]  that's where I am with you.
[2804.50 --> 2805.86]  And so we can rest in God,
[2805.86 --> 2808.70]  who is both powerful and present.
[2809.90 --> 2811.90]  And friends, because God is powerful and present,
[2812.04 --> 2813.22]  that becomes our comfort.
[2814.42 --> 2815.36]  God is great.
[2816.46 --> 2818.02]  And that means that we can rest in him.
[2818.22 --> 2819.14]  We can look to him.
[2819.22 --> 2820.76]  We can trust in him
[2820.76 --> 2823.60]  because he has overcome all things.
[2823.60 --> 2826.30]  The centerpiece of this psalm,
[2826.40 --> 2829.40]  which Gertie and Kobe treasured,
[2829.40 --> 2830.38]  it was their favorite text,
[2830.48 --> 2831.10]  is this command.
[2831.28 --> 2832.00]  You know, it's here.
[2832.88 --> 2833.92]  It's a command that says,
[2834.08 --> 2834.64]  Be still.
[2836.08 --> 2836.84]  God says,
[2837.00 --> 2839.36]  Be still and know that I am God.
[2839.36 --> 2844.52]  That's how I believe from hearing what was shared.
[2844.72 --> 2847.98]  That's how Gertie sought to live his life in faith in God.
[2848.30 --> 2851.84]  To just have this quiet trust in a God who is powerful
[2851.84 --> 2854.06]  and is present on our behalf.
[2854.76 --> 2857.38]  Whatever circumstances and challenges we face in life.
[2858.60 --> 2859.88]  And so family and friends,
[2860.38 --> 2861.08]  like Gert,
[2861.28 --> 2862.04]  I want to invite us,
[2862.10 --> 2863.70]  let's make Psalm 46
[2863.70 --> 2866.32]  the centerpiece of our lives.
[2867.34 --> 2868.46]  To be still,
[2869.36 --> 2870.20]  and to know
[2870.20 --> 2872.70]  that our Heavenly Father,
[2872.88 --> 2873.48]  he is God.
[2874.32 --> 2875.28]  Okay, let's pray together.
[2877.02 --> 2877.82]  Lord Jesus,
[2877.94 --> 2880.20]  we thank you for this incredible hope and comfort
[2880.20 --> 2881.42]  that you have given us.
[2881.98 --> 2884.90]  That you are the great and mighty God.
[2885.82 --> 2887.44]  And that you comfort your children.
[2888.58 --> 2890.64]  You are both powerful and you are present.
[2891.94 --> 2893.52]  And so we can rest in you.
[2894.20 --> 2896.54]  We rejoice and give you thanks for the promise
[2896.54 --> 2901.06]  of your protection in your presence
[2901.06 --> 2903.50]  for Gert as well as all of us
[2903.50 --> 2905.54]  who put our trust in you as he did.
[2906.50 --> 2908.36]  We thank you that you have brought Gert
[2908.36 --> 2909.68]  into your loving arms
[2909.68 --> 2912.00]  where he is now experiencing
[2912.00 --> 2915.02]  the stillness of being in your eternal presence
[2915.02 --> 2918.14]  and the joy of knowing you even more fully.
[2918.14 --> 2921.28]  We ask that you would comfort each of us now
[2921.28 --> 2922.90]  as we miss him
[2922.90 --> 2925.46]  and comfort us in the days to come.
[2926.22 --> 2927.90]  We look to you for these things
[2927.90 --> 2929.24]  and ask it all
[2929.24 --> 2931.80]  in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2932.82 --> 2933.20]  Amen.
[2936.04 --> 2937.92]  And so let us sing one,
[2938.58 --> 2939.90]  well, the next song.
[2940.24 --> 2940.98]  In response,
[2941.42 --> 2942.18]  the song is called
[2942.18 --> 2943.44]  Because He Lives.
[2943.84 --> 2944.68]  So let's all stand
[2944.68 --> 2946.28]  and let's sing again this song.
[2948.14 --> 2978.12]  Because He Lives.
[2978.64 --> 2979.12]  He lives.
[2981.12 --> 2981.88]  He lives.
[2981.88 --> 2982.88]  He lives.
[2984.26 --> 2985.70]  AND quero裝 left?
[2986.54 --> 2991.48]  He lives.
[2991.60 --> 2992.78]  We lift our Lord's Word for Ghost
[2992.78 --> 2994.78]  We are going to demograph
[2994.82 --> 2995.82]  And He gives you peace
[2995.82 --> 2996.52]  Now, He lives.
[2997.62 --> 2998.06]  He gives you life
[2998.06 --> 2999.36]  And Him.
[3000.34 --> 3000.54]  And to accept and honor
[3000.54 --> 3001.88]  His try to donate
[3001.88 --> 3002.56]  And give you peace
[3002.56 --> 3002.94]  He lives.
[3002.94 --> 3032.92]  CHOIR SINGS
[3032.94 --> 3062.92]  CHOIR SINGS
[3062.94 --> 3065.94]  CHOIR SINGS
[3065.94 --> 3067.94]  to victory
[3067.94 --> 3072.24]  and see the light
[3072.24 --> 3073.44]  of glory
[3073.44 --> 3075.94]  and the holy
[3075.94 --> 3077.94]  way
[3077.94 --> 3079.94]  because
[3079.94 --> 3081.94]  he lives
[3083.40 --> 3083.94]  and
[3083.94 --> 3085.94]  waits tomorrow
[3086.80 --> 3089.94]  because
[3089.94 --> 3091.94]  he lives
[3092.74 --> 3093.94]  only
[3093.94 --> 3095.94]  is all
[3095.94 --> 3097.94]  because
[3097.94 --> 3099.94]  I know
[3101.94 --> 3103.94]  he holds the
[3103.94 --> 3105.94]  future
[3105.94 --> 3107.94]  and life
[3107.94 --> 3109.94]  is worth
[3109.94 --> 3111.94]  only
[3111.94 --> 3113.94]  just because
[3113.94 --> 3115.94]  he lives
[3115.94 --> 3117.94]  .
[3117.94 --> 3119.94]  .
[3119.94 --> 3121.94]  .
[3121.94 --> 3123.94]  .
[3123.94 --> 3125.94]  Please remain standing and let's
[3125.94 --> 3127.94]  have a closing prayer
[3127.94 --> 3129.94]  and benediction.
[3129.94 --> 3131.94]  Please pray with me again.
[3131.94 --> 3133.94]  Father of mercies, God of all comfort,
[3133.94 --> 3135.94]  you are our refuge in times of trouble.
[3135.94 --> 3137.94]  You are the light
[3137.94 --> 3139.94]  that comes and shines into
[3139.94 --> 3141.94]  the darkness.
[3141.94 --> 3145.94]  you are our only hope in the face of death.
[3145.94 --> 3153.94]  Lord, help us to believe and trust that your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by dying has destroyed death,
[3153.94 --> 3157.94]  and by rising has restored us to life.
[3157.94 --> 3163.94]  we rejoice, Lord Jesus, that as you live, Gert now also lives.
[3163.94 --> 3167.94]  As you have triumphed over death, so now Gert has triumphed over death.
[3167.94 --> 3179.94]  And as you, Lord, have conquered death and have risen from it, so also Gert will one day rise from the dead to receive the everlasting resurrection life that you promise.
[3179.94 --> 3193.94]  And so, Lord, we pray that you would deepen our trust that neither death nor life, nor things present nor things to come, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from your love.
[3193.94 --> 3205.94]  Immerse us now in the love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, who lives with you in the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
[3205.94 --> 3209.94]  Now receive the benediction.
[3209.94 --> 3217.94]  And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you.
[3217.94 --> 3231.94]  And may the peace of God which surpasses all understanding, keep your hearts and minds, so that you would be still, and know that you're a heavenly Father, that he is God. Amen.
[3231.94 --> 3235.94]  And remain standing, and we'll have one final song as we leave.
[3235.94 --> 3236.94]  Amen.
[3236.94 --> 3237.94]  Amen.
[3237.94 --> 3238.94]  Amen.
[3238.94 --> 3239.94]  Amen.
[3246.94 --> 3250.94]  Amen.
