[250.52 --> 263.00]  A target iron of MXF's have the number of order.
[263.00 --> 273.22]  Good morning. Welcome to this worship service at Ladner Christian Reformed Church. My name
[273.22 --> 278.48]  is Jason. I'm the lead pastor here. And it is a great privilege this morning to be able
[278.48 --> 285.28]  to draw near to our Lord together with you this morning. So before we begin, we just
[285.28 --> 290.82]  have two quick announcements, and I'll ask Marian to give her announcement first.
[293.00 --> 303.08]  Good morning. I received an email from Naomi Bula from World Renew a week or so ago, and
[303.08 --> 309.10]  the full announcement will be in our Connections newsletter, but I just felt that this should
[309.10 --> 315.82]  also be spoken. She says, Dear friends at Ladner CRC, we are grateful for churches like yours
[315.82 --> 321.24]  that support our efforts to restore justice and extend mercy to the world's most vulnerable
[321.24 --> 327.68]  people. Global events continue to bring disheartening news, but we are encouraged by the hope that
[327.68 --> 334.66]  is transforming the lives of those world renews serve, the lives of those whom world renews
[334.66 --> 340.06]  serves. And then she goes on to give us more information. And you will, if you were watching
[340.06 --> 345.16]  before the service, you will have seen the slide, and you see it up on your screen now.
[345.16 --> 361.08]  Last year in 2020, Ladner CRC donated $54,365.85 to the Beirut Explosion, Canadian Food Grains Bank,
[361.08 --> 368.68]  and other programs of world renew around the globe. And so we praise God for the generosity
[368.68 --> 375.26]  of this church, and also for the anonymous significant donation made through a foundation.
[375.26 --> 383.64]  And that anonymous giver, we also praise God for very much. The full announcement will be
[383.64 --> 389.48]  in Connections, as I said, and once again, we give God praise for all the gifts he gives
[389.48 --> 398.52]  us. And we ask that you continue to also pray for World Renew. There is a video that Naomi sent,
[398.52 --> 404.68]  or sent a link to, and perhaps I will see if we can put it on our website so that you can see the
[404.68 --> 411.38]  thanks given by one man in particular in Beirut for all the support that they've been given.
[411.38 --> 421.82]  All right, and so that's from World Renew, and our designated offering for this Sunday
[421.82 --> 430.52]  is Cascade Christian Counseling. And you can give online. There's a place where you can choose a
[430.52 --> 437.54]  designated cause from our website. You can also mail in or drop in a check as well. So this is the second
[437.54 --> 444.02]  Sunday already in the church season of Lent. And Lent is a time when we consider Jesus's suffering and
[444.02 --> 454.20]  death. And Lent is symbolized by the wilderness. You know, the time when the people of God were in the
[454.20 --> 462.50]  wilderness was 40 years, and there are 40 days in Lent. And the wilderness is a dangerous time,
[462.50 --> 469.10]  right? It's a time of struggle and hardship and difficulty. And yet it is also in the wilderness
[469.10 --> 477.72]  that we see God powerfully show up and provide for his people. But also in the church calendar,
[478.64 --> 485.02]  it's all important to realize, even in the midst of these seasons of fasting, that every Sunday
[485.02 --> 491.68]  is actually like a mini Easter. Every Sunday is like an oasis in the desert.
[492.50 --> 498.26]  And so it's a feast day in the middle of the season of Lent. And so it's a time today where we
[498.26 --> 506.58]  break the fast. It's a time when we draw near to the Lord and worship him. And I know it can feel
[506.58 --> 514.14]  like we are wandering in a wilderness right now. But by faith, we can draw near to God's presence.
[514.14 --> 522.70]  And we can draw from the well of God's grace and be nourished and replenished by him. And that's what
[522.70 --> 529.10]  we are doing together this morning. And so let's, would you please join with me in a word of prayer
[529.10 --> 535.06]  as we begin? And then we will sing some songs of praise. Would you please pray with me? Father,
[535.06 --> 544.08]  we come to you this morning because you are the giver of life. You are the one where we can drink and
[544.08 --> 552.78]  our thirst can be quenched. And Lord, we are parched. We are wandering in a wilderness, in a desert.
[553.70 --> 560.08]  But Lord, we come to you this morning for life. We look to you. We worship you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[560.08 --> 566.96]  Lord, would you receive our worship this morning? And would you meet us where we are? We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[566.96 --> 567.02]  Amen.
[567.02 --> 567.70]  Amen.
[575.70 --> 576.50]  Amen.
[576.94 --> 577.02]  Thank you.
[582.16 --> 588.58]  Oh, worship the King, the Lord is above.
[588.96 --> 592.54]  Oh, glory, and grace both and yes.
[592.54 --> 608.70]  His power and His love, our shield and defender, the ancient of days, pavilion in splendor and girded with praise.
[608.70 --> 635.04]  Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite, it breathes in the air, it shines in the light, it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.
[635.04 --> 649.14]  Frail children of dust and feeble as frail, in you do we trust, nor find you to fail.
[649.14 --> 663.14]  Your mercies how tender has worked till the end, our maker, defender, redeemer and friend.
[665.04 --> 692.04]  You're the word of God, the Father, from before the world began.
[692.04 --> 700.10]  Every star and every planet has been fashioned by your head.
[700.42 --> 707.04]  All creation holds together by the power of your voice.
[707.04 --> 715.04]  Let the skies declare your glory, let the land and seas rejoice.
[715.04 --> 722.04]  The author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone.
[722.04 --> 729.34]  And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[734.04 --> 742.04]  Yet you left the gaze of angels, came to seek and save the lost,
[742.04 --> 749.04]  And exchange the joy of heaven for the anguish of a cross.
[749.04 --> 757.04]  With a prayer you fed the hungry, with a word you calmed the sea.
[757.04 --> 764.04]  Yet how silently you suffer, that the guilty may go free.
[764.04 --> 772.04]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone.
[772.04 --> 779.04]  And your cry of love rings out across the lands.
[779.04 --> 786.04]  Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One.
[786.04 --> 801.04]  The Holy One is here.
[801.04 --> 823.04]  Come bow before Him now, with reverence and fear.
[823.04 --> 830.04]  Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is here.
[830.04 --> 835.04]  In Him no sin is found, we stand on holy ground.
[835.04 --> 845.04]  Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One is here.
[845.04 --> 862.04]  Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is shining all around.
[862.04 --> 873.04]  He burns with holy fire, with splendor He is crowned.
[873.04 --> 884.04]  How awesome is the light, how awesome is the light, our radiant King of light.
[884.04 --> 897.04]  Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is shining all around.
[897.04 --> 898.04]  Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is shining all around.
[898.04 --> 899.04]  Be still for the power of the Lord, the Holy One is shining all around.
[899.04 --> 904.04]  Be still for the power of the Lord, the Holy One is moving in this place.
[904.04 --> 916.04]  He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister His grace.
[916.04 --> 921.04]  He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister His grace.
[921.04 --> 931.04]  No work too hard for Him, if faith received from Him.
[931.04 --> 944.04]  Be still for the power of the Lord, the Holy One is moving in this place.
[944.04 --> 951.04]  Be still for the power of the Lord, the Holy One is moving in this place.
[951.04 --> 953.04]  Be still for the power of the Lord, the Holy One is moving in this place.
[953.04 --> 963.04]  As we come now to this time of confession, we are reminded how the season of Lent focuses on the sober reality that life apart from God is death.
[963.04 --> 970.04]  Our hearts choose sin and death too often.
[970.04 --> 977.04]  And just as Lent is built into the church calendar to provide a structure and focus,
[977.04 --> 988.04]  so also this time is built into our weekly worship service as a time when we can together come and acknowledge our need for God's grace.
[988.04 --> 995.04]  And so today, we'll have our prayer of confession here on the screen.
[995.04 --> 999.04]  You can feel free to read it along, but it's kind of long, so I will read it.
[999.04 --> 1002.04]  And you can listen or read together with me, up to you.
[1004.04 --> 1017.04]  Almighty God, because of Christ's blood, do not hold against us, poor sinners that we are, any of the sins we do, or the evil that constantly clings to us.
[1017.04 --> 1026.04]  Forgive us, just as we are fully determined, as evidence of your grace in us, to forgive our neighbors.
[1026.04 --> 1033.04]  By ourselves, we are too weak to hold our own, even for a moment.
[1033.04 --> 1040.04]  And our sworn enemies, the devil, the world, and our own flesh, never stop attacking us.
[1040.04 --> 1049.04]  And so, Lord, uphold us and make us strong with the strength of your Holy Spirit,
[1049.04 --> 1056.04]  so that we may not go down to defeat in this spiritual struggle, but may firmly resist our enemies,
[1056.04 --> 1063.04]  until we finally win the complete victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[1063.04 --> 1072.04]  And also, now hear these words of grace from 1 Peter.
[1072.04 --> 1079.04]  So, brothers and sisters, may the peace of Christ be with you.
[1079.04 --> 1091.04]  And also with you.
[1091.04 --> 1103.04]  And let's sing a song of renewal together.
[1103.04 --> 1104.04]  And also with you.
[1104.04 --> 1108.04]  And let's sing a song of renewal together.
[1108.04 --> 1126.04]  What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul?
[1126.04 --> 1135.04]  What wondrous love is this, O my soul?
[1135.04 --> 1144.04]  What wondrous love is this, that caused the Lord a bliss,
[1144.04 --> 1161.04]  O my soul, O my soul, O my soul, O my soul?
[1161.04 --> 1179.04]  When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down.
[1179.04 --> 1188.04]  Beneath God's righteous ground, beneath God's righteous ground.
[1188.04 --> 1197.04]  Christ laid aside his ground for my soul, for my soul.
[1197.04 --> 1206.04]  Christ laid aside his ground for my soul.
[1206.04 --> 1215.04]  To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing.
[1215.04 --> 1223.04]  To God and to the Lamb I will sing.
[1223.04 --> 1232.04]  To God and to the Lamb, who is the great I Am.
[1232.04 --> 1241.04]  While millions join the theme, I will sing.
[1241.04 --> 1250.04]  While millions join the theme, I will sing.
[1250.04 --> 1263.04]  So good morning again on this kind of drizzly day.
[1263.04 --> 1273.04]  When you begin a new company or a business, one of the first things you need to do is build a website.
[1273.04 --> 1281.04]  One of my hobbies ever since I was pretty young, kind of even beginning in high school, is building websites.
[1281.04 --> 1282.04]  I really enjoy it.
[1282.04 --> 1288.04]  But actually before you make a website, you need to design your logo.
[1288.04 --> 1293.04]  And your logo is a symbol used to communicate your identity.
[1293.04 --> 1303.04]  And you hope that with your logo, as soon as someone sees it, you know, they will recognize your brand and know what it is that you sell or what you do.
[1303.04 --> 1312.04]  And there are, you know, many logos in our world that are immediately recognizable, right, even to most people.
[1312.04 --> 1319.04]  So, you know, for instance, you're driving down the highway and you've been on a long road trip and you see that sign on the side of the road.
[1319.04 --> 1323.04]  It's these golden arches and salvation, you know.
[1323.04 --> 1325.04]  Well, you can eat. You can eat some food.
[1325.04 --> 1329.04]  Sometimes that's all there is, but it's recognizable.
[1329.04 --> 1338.04]  Or, you know, you're trying to get to the office in the morning and you see that circle green Starbucks sign.
[1338.04 --> 1339.04]  And you can have life.
[1339.04 --> 1342.04]  No, I'm just kidding. You can have some coffee.
[1342.04 --> 1349.04]  You know, maybe we see the Apple logo with that bite out of it for Apple Computer.
[1349.04 --> 1356.04]  But probably the most recognizable and most powerful logo throughout all of human history is what?
[1356.04 --> 1357.04]  It's the cross.
[1357.04 --> 1360.04]  You know, we, there's one in our sanctuary up here.
[1360.04 --> 1362.04]  It's a big wooden cross.
[1362.04 --> 1373.04]  Anita has painted these beautiful, lovely crosses to help us celebrate, but remember, consider the season of Lent.
[1373.04 --> 1377.04]  You know, maybe you wear a cross around your neck.
[1377.04 --> 1382.04]  The logo of Christianity is the cross.
[1382.04 --> 1385.04]  Now, the church didn't immediately accept the cross as its logo.
[1385.04 --> 1389.04]  I mean, it is, after all, a symbol of torture.
[1389.04 --> 1397.04]  And many criminals have been killed on crosses before Jesus and after him.
[1397.04 --> 1402.04]  But as early as the second century, the church began to use the cross as its symbol.
[1402.04 --> 1405.04]  But what does the cross mean?
[1405.04 --> 1410.04]  You know, we've begun the season of Lent, you know, as we've already said.
[1410.04 --> 1418.04]  And this is the season in the life of the church when we turn our attention as we go through the life of Christ from his birth and his ministry.
[1418.04 --> 1425.04]  And now we consider his suffering leading up to his death on the cross.
[1425.04 --> 1437.04]  And so today, in order to help us turn our attention to Christ's suffering and death, we're going to begin a sermon series starting today for the next six weeks leading up to Easter.
[1437.04 --> 1440.04]  And it's a series called On the Cross.
[1440.04 --> 1444.04]  And the real question of our sermon series is this.
[1444.04 --> 1448.04]  What is the significance of that logo?
[1448.04 --> 1449.04]  Right?
[1449.04 --> 1452.04]  What does the, what does Jesus' death on the cross mean for us?
[1452.04 --> 1454.04]  What did Jesus accomplish?
[1454.04 --> 1459.04]  And if you've been a Christian for any length of time, you may have a ready answer to that.
[1459.04 --> 1462.04]  You can say, well, Jesus died for my sins.
[1462.04 --> 1463.04]  And that is true.
[1463.04 --> 1464.04]  That is right.
[1464.04 --> 1472.04]  It's kind of more of a, a quick thumbnail sketch of a whole lot of things though that Jesus actually accomplished.
[1472.04 --> 1479.04]  But the Bible actually gives us many pictures to help us understand the cross.
[1479.04 --> 1491.04]  Really in as many ways as you can describe humanity's problem, in that many ways the cross of Christ can be seen as our rescue or our restoration.
[1491.04 --> 1497.04]  So there's a lot of variety in the Bible, a lot of variety of language to talk about the cross.
[1497.04 --> 1505.04]  And friends, that tells us that the significance of the cross of Jesus' death for us is big.
[1505.04 --> 1512.04]  It is rich and multifaceted, kind of like when you have a kaleidoscope.
[1512.04 --> 1520.04]  I don't know if you've ever seen a kaleidoscope where you look through it, it's kind of like a telescope, but it has all of these pieces of glass or colored glass in it.
[1520.04 --> 1523.04]  And you turn it and you see a beautiful picture every time you turn it.
[1523.04 --> 1532.04]  And as we look at the scriptures and we, we turn the kaleidoscope, we see different pictures of Jesus' death and what it means for us.
[1532.04 --> 1537.04]  You know, even in the passage we're about to read together, we see this diversity.
[1537.04 --> 1546.04]  We hear about the deliverance from slavery, the destruction of death, the defeat of the devil, and the atonement for sin.
[1546.04 --> 1551.04]  Those are just some of the pictures that we'll explore today and then different ones over the coming weeks.
[1551.04 --> 1558.04]  So today, let's turn in our Bibles to the book of Hebrews in the New Testament.
[1558.04 --> 1562.04]  And we'll be looking at Hebrews chapter 2, verses 14 to 17.
[1562.04 --> 1566.04]  And we will have the passage on the screen for us.
[1566.04 --> 1571.04]  So please give your attention to God's word.
[1571.04 --> 1576.04]  Since the children have flesh and blood,
[1576.04 --> 1586.04]  He, too, shared in their humanity, so that by His death, He might break the power of Him who holds the power of death, that is the devil,
[1586.04 --> 1591.04]  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
[1591.04 --> 1597.04]  For surely it is not angels He helps, but Abraham's descendants.
[1597.04 --> 1609.04]  For this reason, He had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in service to God,
[1609.04 --> 1614.04]  and that He might make atonement for the sins of the people.
[1614.04 --> 1618.04]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1618.04 --> 1623.04]  Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
[1623.04 --> 1629.04]  And today we consider how on the cross, Jesus entered into our humanity.
[1629.04 --> 1631.04]  That's what we're going to talk about today.
[1631.04 --> 1634.04]  And He did that in three ways that we're going to look at.
[1634.04 --> 1637.04]  He entered first into our physical life.
[1637.04 --> 1640.04]  Secondly, He entered into our physical death.
[1640.04 --> 1643.04]  And then thirdly, He became our mediator.
[1643.04 --> 1647.04]  So the first thing today is He entered our life.
[1647.04 --> 1649.04]  He entered into our physical life.
[1649.04 --> 1652.04]  And this is something that we're already familiar with.
[1652.04 --> 1657.04]  You know, this is something that we celebrate and remember at Christmas when Jesus was born.
[1657.04 --> 1663.04]  But even though it's familiar to us, let's not pass over it too quickly or minimize it.
[1663.04 --> 1665.04]  There's more that we can learn here.
[1665.04 --> 1671.04]  So the Bible teaches that Jesus is both fully God and fully man.
[1671.04 --> 1676.04]  So yes, we say, you know, we say Jesus is our Emmanuel.
[1676.04 --> 1680.04]  He is God with us.
[1680.04 --> 1687.04]  But it's just as important to stress that He is God with us.
[1687.04 --> 1694.04]  That is to say that Jesus Christ is the holy God, right?
[1694.04 --> 1698.04]  The one for whom and through whom all things were created.
[1698.04 --> 1703.04]  This God became fully and truly human.
[1703.04 --> 1707.04]  See what we read here in verse 14 in our passage.
[1707.04 --> 1714.04]  It says, since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity.
[1714.04 --> 1715.04]  Right?
[1715.04 --> 1719.04]  Jesus took on flesh and blood and entered into our physical life.
[1719.04 --> 1721.04]  And so what does this teach us about God?
[1721.04 --> 1724.04]  What does it teach us about life and about our salvation?
[1724.04 --> 1729.04]  One thing it teaches us that God cares about the physical.
[1729.04 --> 1731.04]  God cares about the physical.
[1731.04 --> 1733.04]  You know, so think about it this way.
[1733.04 --> 1739.04]  Why is it that it says that God, here in this passage it says He was very upset about death.
[1739.04 --> 1745.04]  These verses say that Jesus came to share our humanity so death could be destroyed.
[1745.04 --> 1749.04]  But why is God so upset about death?
[1749.04 --> 1755.04]  I mean, after all, if you and I believe in Jesus, the Bible says that when we die our souls go to be with God.
[1755.04 --> 1756.04]  Right?
[1756.04 --> 1757.04]  So isn't that fine?
[1757.04 --> 1758.04]  That's great, right?
[1758.04 --> 1761.04]  So why not just leave it at that?
[1761.04 --> 1769.04]  But what passages like this one tell us is that God is not only concerned about the soul.
[1769.04 --> 1772.04]  Actually, we just sang the song, What Wondrous Love Is This?
[1772.04 --> 1775.04]  Where God came to save our souls.
[1775.04 --> 1777.04]  I would actually disagree a little bit.
[1777.04 --> 1779.04]  I think He did.
[1779.04 --> 1782.04]  And if soul means our whole self, that's fine.
[1782.04 --> 1787.04]  But actually, God came not only to save our souls, but to save our physical lives as well.
[1787.04 --> 1788.04]  Right?
[1788.04 --> 1793.04]  He's concerned with what is destroying our flesh and blood.
[1793.04 --> 1798.04]  And friends, this is absolutely central to Christianity.
[1798.04 --> 1805.04]  And so as we look at the whole story of the Bible, we see these three major pictures that show us about God.
[1805.04 --> 1808.04]  The first picture is in creation.
[1808.04 --> 1816.04]  So in the very beginning, we have God with His hands in the dirt.
[1816.04 --> 1817.04]  Right?
[1817.04 --> 1818.04]  I think it's such a cool image.
[1818.04 --> 1825.04]  You know, when I go to pick up my kids from school sometimes, the playground in the fields are just mud pits.
[1825.04 --> 1828.04]  Because it's winter and it's raining all the time.
[1828.04 --> 1830.04]  And there are gigantic puddles.
[1830.04 --> 1836.04]  And my kids will wear their rain boots and they step in the puddle and it goes right up to the top of their boot almost.
[1836.04 --> 1841.04]  And if they're not careful, the mud and rain will just even pour right into their boots.
[1841.04 --> 1843.04]  They love to tramp around in the mud.
[1843.04 --> 1846.04]  But I don't want them to get dirty.
[1846.04 --> 1848.04]  I tell them, get out of the mud.
[1848.04 --> 1851.04]  Because I don't want them to be covered in mud and to bring it into the house.
[1851.04 --> 1858.04]  But when we think about God, the kids would have a good argument for why they should be able to play in the mud.
[1858.04 --> 1861.04]  Because God did.
[1861.04 --> 1865.04]  They can say, we're being like God.
[1865.04 --> 1876.04]  You know, in creation, God is shaping this world with His hands, so to speak, in the real physical matter of this world.
[1876.04 --> 1883.04]  And He's creating an amazing world and then He's breathing the Spirit of God into the dust, into the dirt, and creating human beings.
[1883.04 --> 1890.04]  So, men and women, unlike anything else in creation, there's this unity of heaven and earth.
[1890.04 --> 1893.04]  There is a unity between the material and the spiritual.
[1893.04 --> 1894.04]  Right?
[1894.04 --> 1895.04]  And that's us.
[1895.04 --> 1898.04]  We are made in the image of God from dust and spirit.
[1898.04 --> 1902.04]  And you know, this is completely different from all other religions.
[1902.04 --> 1910.04]  You know, in Eastern religions, the material, the physical world is actually thought to basically be unreal, to be an illusion.
[1910.04 --> 1915.04]  And salvation, therefore, is to transcend this material world.
[1915.04 --> 1922.04]  In the ancient Western religions, the Greeks taught that matter is bad.
[1922.04 --> 1923.04]  It is temporary.
[1923.04 --> 1929.04]  And so they believed that if there was a supreme being, that He would have nothing to do with the creation of the world,
[1929.04 --> 1933.04]  that there would be lesser in a hierarchy of spiritual beings,
[1933.04 --> 1940.04]  and these lesser demigods would be the ones who would create the world, because the world is seen as polluted and dirty.
[1940.04 --> 1945.04]  And salvation is getting away from this world, away from these bodies.
[1945.04 --> 1952.04]  But in Christianity, you have God with His hands in the mud.
[1952.04 --> 1958.04]  And the Spirit of God hovering over the face of all of it, in and through all of creation.
[1958.04 --> 1960.04]  So that's creation.
[1960.04 --> 1963.04]  That's this picture of God that we have in creation.
[1963.04 --> 1965.04]  A second picture is incarnation.
[1965.04 --> 1973.04]  When God saw that His creation had fallen into the slavery of death because of our sin, what did He do?
[1973.04 --> 1975.04]  He entered it.
[1975.04 --> 1976.04]  Right?
[1976.04 --> 1979.04]  God wanted to have real solidarity with us as His people.
[1979.04 --> 1982.04]  And this passage calls us children.
[1982.04 --> 1991.04]  And because we are flesh and blood, God became flesh and blood.
[1991.04 --> 1999.04]  You know, when a baby is born, even after only a few weeks, they're going through this tremendous growth and development.
[1999.04 --> 2005.04]  But kind of from the perspective of the parents, the baby really only does three things, as far as you can tell.
[2005.04 --> 2014.04]  They sleep, they eat, and they make a lot of dirty diapers.
[2014.04 --> 2019.04]  And Jesus took on this infant stage of existence.
[2019.04 --> 2021.04]  He took on flesh.
[2021.04 --> 2025.04]  He became like one of us.
[2025.04 --> 2028.04]  And there's a theological word for this.
[2028.04 --> 2034.04]  And I want us to learn this word and adapt it into our vocabularies.
[2034.04 --> 2036.04]  Theologians call it recapitulation.
[2036.04 --> 2037.04]  Okay?
[2037.04 --> 2038.04]  Recapitulation.
[2038.04 --> 2045.04]  In recapitulation, Christ puts Himself in the place of humanity to restore humanity.
[2045.04 --> 2057.04]  And so actually what it does is, drawing from Romans 6 especially, where Paul talks about the parallel between Adam, our first father, and Jesus, the second Adam.
[2057.04 --> 2058.04]  The second Adam.
[2058.04 --> 2067.04]  And so as all of us were in some sense present in Adam, and therefore fell with him into sin,
[2067.04 --> 2076.04]  in a similar way, by faith we are in Christ and participate in His death, and ultimately in His triumph over sin and death.
[2076.04 --> 2085.04]  So you can think of it like this, that Jesus became one with us so that we could become one with Him.
[2085.04 --> 2093.04]  So listen to this second century theologian, a bishop named Irenaeus.
[2093.04 --> 2097.04]  He became bishop in Lyon in France in the second century.
[2097.04 --> 2102.04]  And he's very famous for coming up with this theological term, recapitulation.
[2102.04 --> 2107.04]  So I put the quote here on the screen, just so you can help follow along with me.
[2107.04 --> 2109.04]  This is what he writes.
[2109.04 --> 2122.04]  For by no other means could we have obtained to incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and immortality.
[2122.04 --> 2132.04]  But how could we have been joined to them, unless first incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also are?
[2132.04 --> 2144.04]  So the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the mortal by immortality, that we might receive the adoption of sons and daughters.
[2144.04 --> 2152.04]  So our passage says that Jesus became like us in every way.
[2152.04 --> 2153.04]  Right?
[2153.04 --> 2162.04]  He had, of course, this amazing power to do miracles, because He was fully God, but He also was fully human.
[2162.04 --> 2164.04]  He was hungry.
[2164.04 --> 2165.04]  Right?
[2165.04 --> 2171.04]  We read about Him being thirsty, being hurt, being tired.
[2171.04 --> 2172.04]  Right?
[2172.04 --> 2176.04]  We read about Jesus feeling discouraged, but without doubting God.
[2176.04 --> 2181.04]  We find Him being angry, but without being selfish.
[2181.04 --> 2185.04]  Jesus recapitulated the experience of being human.
[2185.04 --> 2189.04]  He lived, in a sense, the life that we were created to live.
[2189.04 --> 2193.04]  So in a sense, even though we're talking about the cross, we need more than the cross.
[2193.04 --> 2197.04]  We need Jesus' life, as well as His death.
[2199.04 --> 2202.04]  But then there's this third image, because we also need His resurrection.
[2202.04 --> 2210.04]  And this is, again, the third image that we have in the Bible about God, and we see it in Jesus before He leaves.
[2210.04 --> 2214.04]  After Jesus rises from the dead, He's sitting down with His disciples.
[2214.04 --> 2218.04]  And at first, you know, this is totally new.
[2218.04 --> 2219.04]  They weren't expecting this.
[2219.04 --> 2220.04]  Jesus is alive.
[2220.04 --> 2224.04]  So that He's sitting with His disciples, and they're just like, you're a ghost.
[2224.04 --> 2227.04]  And so Jesus is like, come on, really?
[2227.04 --> 2229.04]  So He's like, bring me some fish.
[2229.04 --> 2231.04]  Bring me something to eat.
[2231.04 --> 2233.04]  And He eats it.
[2233.04 --> 2235.04]  And then He's like, can ghosts do that?
[2235.04 --> 2236.04]  Right?
[2236.04 --> 2245.04]  And so what He's saying is that the future redemption that God has in mind for His creation for us is restored humanity.
[2245.04 --> 2246.04]  Right?
[2246.04 --> 2249.04]  It's flesh and blood, but without the effects of the fall.
[2249.04 --> 2250.04]  Right?
[2250.04 --> 2251.04]  Death is finally defeated.
[2251.04 --> 2253.04]  There will be no more physical death.
[2253.04 --> 2261.04]  Because God created the physical and the spiritual, and He's going to save the physical and the spiritual.
[2261.04 --> 2267.04]  What this means is we will eat and drink in the kingdom of God.
[2267.04 --> 2269.04]  We will feast in the house of Zion.
[2269.04 --> 2270.04]  Right?
[2270.04 --> 2272.04]  We will love and embrace.
[2272.04 --> 2274.04]  We will sing with mouths.
[2274.04 --> 2280.04]  We will stomp around in mud on this earth.
[2280.04 --> 2287.04]  And so entering into physical life is part of this rich thing that we call the cross.
[2287.04 --> 2296.04]  You know, and so what it tells us is that God's love for us took shape in Jesus entering into our physical life.
[2298.04 --> 2306.04]  But secondly, there's another thing that Jesus did that Jesus entered also into our physical death.
[2306.04 --> 2317.04]  You know, in our fallen state, because of sin that has come and polluted and broken the world, death reigns over all of human life.
[2317.04 --> 2318.04]  Right?
[2318.04 --> 2322.04]  Death has cast a shadow over all of creation.
[2322.04 --> 2324.04]  Death is inescapable.
[2325.04 --> 2327.04]  But what does our passage say?
[2327.04 --> 2329.04]  If we keep reading, it says,
[2329.04 --> 2338.04]  Jesus shared in our humanity so that by His death He might break the power of Him who holds the power of death, that is the devil,
[2338.04 --> 2342.04]  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.
[2342.04 --> 2343.04]  Right?
[2343.04 --> 2352.04]  And so when we see death all around us, we're grieved by it, we're sorrowful, sorrowful, however we say that,
[2352.04 --> 2355.04]  because we know it's not the way things are meant to be.
[2355.04 --> 2360.04]  God did not create the world like this, but death has a power over us.
[2363.04 --> 2366.04]  And so you might say, well, I'm not afraid of death.
[2367.04 --> 2369.04]  Maybe like Mark Twain, you say,
[2369.04 --> 2371.04]  I do not fear death.
[2371.04 --> 2377.04]  I've been dead for billions of years before I was born and have not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.
[2378.04 --> 2379.04]  It's a good quote.
[2380.04 --> 2382.04]  But I want to push back on it.
[2383.04 --> 2389.04]  Right? Because you may say you're not afraid of death, but our culture certainly is.
[2390.04 --> 2392.04]  Right? You know, and we see it in all kinds of ways.
[2392.04 --> 2394.04]  When people die, what do we say?
[2395.04 --> 2396.04]  Well, we say they passed away.
[2396.04 --> 2399.04]  We don't have funerals.
[2399.04 --> 2400.04]  What do we have?
[2400.04 --> 2401.04]  We have celebrations of life.
[2402.04 --> 2405.04]  We don't tend to the dead ourselves.
[2406.04 --> 2408.04]  We have a whole industry that takes care of all of that.
[2409.04 --> 2410.04]  Okay?
[2410.04 --> 2413.04]  It's just very kind of separated from what we have to deal with.
[2414.04 --> 2417.04]  When we grieve over someone who has died in our culture,
[2417.04 --> 2420.04]  well, this should be done in private, not kind of publicly.
[2420.04 --> 2427.04]  And when we are around someone who has lost someone to death, we feel uncomfortable.
[2428.04 --> 2429.04]  Right? We don't know what to say.
[2430.04 --> 2432.04]  We feel completely helpless in those situations.
[2433.04 --> 2439.04]  You know, and also we look at kind of technology and there are people now trying to solve the problem of death.
[2439.04 --> 2441.04]  This is like the new frontier.
[2442.04 --> 2444.04]  Mars is one of them, as we've been reading.
[2445.04 --> 2446.04]  And death.
[2446.04 --> 2454.04]  Right? Some people are trying to figure out how can we upload our minds to some computer so that in the future we can kind of redownload it and have live forever.
[2454.04 --> 2457.04]  Why do people do these things?
[2457.04 --> 2464.04]  Well, I mean, okay, it's to prolong life, but it's actually driven by the fear of death.
[2465.04 --> 2469.04]  We live in a culture that is wildly avoiding of death.
[2469.04 --> 2475.04]  And so we can ask, are we really as confident as Mark Twain after all?
[2475.04 --> 2480.04]  Even Sigmund Freud wrote this.
[2480.04 --> 2483.04]  He said, the fear of death dominates us more than we know.
[2484.04 --> 2487.04]  Right? So he agrees with Hebrews.
[2488.04 --> 2491.04]  Fear of death causes us to be subject to lifelong slavery.
[2492.04 --> 2496.04]  Think about what your life would look like if you actually weren't afraid of death.
[2498.04 --> 2501.04]  You know, and it goes all the way back to Genesis 2.
[2501.04 --> 2513.04]  God commanded the man, you are free to eat from any tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it, you will surely die.
[2514.04 --> 2517.04]  So, you know, death means physical death.
[2518.04 --> 2528.04]  But in many ways, our physical death is just the finishing touch on a whole bunch of things that go along with death.
[2528.04 --> 2537.04]  You know, and so when we think about death and all that it means, one way we can do that is to think about God's original vision for life.
[2538.04 --> 2540.04]  What did God intend when he made life?
[2541.04 --> 2545.04]  And, you know, there's always kind of four relationships, four ways we can look at it.
[2545.04 --> 2547.04]  First, life means fellowship with God.
[2547.04 --> 2554.04]  We were created for loving, joyful, deep communion with God to live with his blessing upon us.
[2555.04 --> 2559.04]  Life was also means that we were made in God's image.
[2559.04 --> 2563.04]  We are made with dignity and glory and honor and beauty.
[2563.04 --> 2568.04]  We are made to be at peace with ourselves, comfortable in our own skin and who God has made us to be.
[2568.04 --> 2573.04]  Life means deep relationships with other people, right?
[2573.04 --> 2577.04]  Adam and Eve, before the fall, they were naked and unashamed.
[2577.04 --> 2580.04]  They had this mutual delight and joy in one another.
[2581.04 --> 2585.04]  And life meant having good work to do in the world.
[2585.04 --> 2593.04]  God gave us this command to Adam and Eve to go and fill the world with people and to bring forth life from it,
[2593.04 --> 2598.04]  to work in the dirt, to bring forth beauty and goodness.
[2599.04 --> 2601.04]  But then sin came.
[2601.04 --> 2603.04]  It broke everything.
[2604.04 --> 2614.04]  And all that means is that this vision of life that God has, the way God created things, all of it is broken.
[2614.04 --> 2618.04]  So death is physical death, but it's also so much bigger, right?
[2618.04 --> 2623.04]  In place of fellowship with God, we are estranged from him.
[2623.04 --> 2629.04]  And because we are estranged from him, because we rebelled against him, we are condemned because of our sin.
[2629.04 --> 2632.04]  And now also we are disobedient to God in our lives.
[2633.04 --> 2638.04]  Instead of peace with ourselves, we try to cover our nakedness into shame.
[2639.04 --> 2644.04]  Instead of loving relationships, sin has broken our life with one another.
[2644.04 --> 2648.04]  In place of meaningful work, there is thorns.
[2649.04 --> 2653.04]  And instead of harmony with creation, we physically die.
[2654.04 --> 2663.04]  Right? This is the human condition as we experience it under the shadow of death, under this sentence of death that is in this world.
[2663.04 --> 2669.04]  And so, you know, I want us to kind of think very holistically about what death means.
[2670.04 --> 2676.04]  And not only are we under this power of death that this passage talks about,
[2677.04 --> 2682.04]  our passage also says that the devil is the one that holds the power of death.
[2682.04 --> 2687.04]  It tells us that Satan uses our fear of death as a weapon against us.
[2687.04 --> 2694.04]  And so, when Jesus came into this world and he's acting out salvation, it's not an empty stage.
[2694.04 --> 2697.04]  He's coming into occupied territory.
[2698.04 --> 2703.04]  That is, with a master and a lord over it who is the devil.
[2703.04 --> 2713.04]  The Bible tells us that the devil exists and that he is absolutely committed to the reign of death and misery in this world.
[2714.04 --> 2719.04]  The Bible doesn't give us a whole lot about this entire other world.
[2720.04 --> 2722.04]  It just opens a window to it for a moment.
[2722.04 --> 2725.04]  Like in the Bible, in verse 16 that we have here, it says,
[2725.04 --> 2729.04]  For surely it's not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.
[2729.04 --> 2731.04]  And we're like, wait, stop. What?
[2732.04 --> 2735.04]  And we see this window opens up and we're like, oh my gosh, what's all that about?
[2735.04 --> 2737.04]  And then it closes and moves on.
[2738.04 --> 2744.04]  You know, the Bible, probably for our own good, is very sparing in what it tells us about the spiritual world.
[2745.04 --> 2747.04]  But here's the truth that we can know.
[2748.04 --> 2750.04]  That our world belongs to God.
[2750.04 --> 2751.04]  Right?
[2751.04 --> 2754.04]  He is ultimately the Lord and King over it.
[2754.04 --> 2757.04]  All life and death are in his hands.
[2758.04 --> 2773.04]  And yet, it is true that our adversary, our enemy, the one who, you know, is lying in wait to destroy us, who prowls like a lion, is sometimes called the ruler of this world.
[2774.04 --> 2779.04]  For reasons known only to God, he has given the devil this power over death.
[2779.04 --> 2781.04]  This leverage against us.
[2782.04 --> 2785.04]  But then, you know, we look at the Gospel of John.
[2786.04 --> 2791.04]  As Jesus is talking about his passion, as the cross is approaching.
[2792.04 --> 2795.04]  Jesus says to his disciples, he says this,
[2795.04 --> 2803.04]  I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming, but he has no power over me.
[2804.04 --> 2806.04]  It says he has no hold over me.
[2807.04 --> 2808.04]  Right?
[2808.04 --> 2814.04]  This hints that the ruler of this world does have a claim on us as sinners, but not on Jesus.
[2814.04 --> 2817.04]  Satan can't force Jesus to do anything.
[2817.04 --> 2828.04]  But the beauty of the Gospel is that Jesus comes into our situation and he did so willingly by his own free decision.
[2828.04 --> 2833.04]  He fully became one of us knowing what it would cost him.
[2833.04 --> 2836.04]  Not just that there was a risk, but because there would actually be death.
[2837.04 --> 2841.04]  He was tempted in every way that we are, yet without sin.
[2842.04 --> 2845.04]  And he, the spotless one, died in our place.
[2845.04 --> 2857.04]  And our slavery to death, our fear of death, and whatever jurisdiction the devil has over people is ended by the death of Jesus.
[2858.04 --> 2864.04]  Right? And that is true, friends, even if we don't experience it today as such.
[2865.04 --> 2871.04]  Maybe sometimes we still do feel like slaves to death or fearful of death.
[2871.04 --> 2873.04]  The devil still can attack us.
[2874.04 --> 2877.04]  We are no longer slaves in Egypt.
[2877.04 --> 2881.04]  We have been set free, but we're not yet in the promised land.
[2882.04 --> 2885.04]  We are on a journey, as we will sing later.
[2887.04 --> 2891.04]  So God's only son has entered into our physical life.
[2891.04 --> 2893.04]  He has entered into our physical death.
[2894.04 --> 2896.04]  But thirdly, he has become our mediator.
[2896.04 --> 2905.04]  He entered, in a sense, into the place between the holy God and sinful humanity as our faithful high priest.
[2906.04 --> 2908.04]  And we see this in verse 17.
[2909.04 --> 2914.04]  For this reason, he had to be made like them, fully human in every way,
[2914.04 --> 2920.04]  in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service to God.
[2920.04 --> 2924.04]  And that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
[2924.04 --> 2926.04]  Right? So what's a priest?
[2926.04 --> 2927.04]  A priest is a mediator.
[2927.04 --> 2930.04]  A priest is someone who brings us to God.
[2931.04 --> 2934.04]  And that's what this word atonement means that we find here.
[2935.04 --> 2939.04]  The atonement is about repairing a division.
[2939.04 --> 2942.04]  It's about healing a wound.
[2942.04 --> 2945.04]  It's about being made at one with God.
[2946.04 --> 2950.04]  So on the one hand, sin and guilt are done away with.
[2950.04 --> 2953.04]  And on the other hand, peace and unity are restored.
[2954.04 --> 2959.04]  So Jesus is our high priest, it says, who makes atonement for the sins of the people.
[2960.04 --> 2963.04]  So what is the role of the Jewish high priest?
[2963.04 --> 2967.04]  So the first high priest of Israel was Aaron.
[2967.04 --> 2969.04]  He was the brother of Moses.
[2969.04 --> 2975.04]  And once a year, he was to go behind the curtain into the Holy of Holies.
[2975.04 --> 2977.04]  The holiest place in the tabernacle.
[2978.04 --> 2982.04]  And he had to make all sorts of preparations before he could go in.
[2983.04 --> 2985.04]  Because, you know, there's this tragic story.
[2986.04 --> 2992.04]  Once, two of his sons had not followed the very careful instructions for how to serve as faithful priests.
[2992.04 --> 2995.04]  And they both died as a result.
[2995.04 --> 2998.04]  So Aaron had to purify himself.
[2998.04 --> 3001.04]  Make sacrifices for his own sin.
[3001.04 --> 3007.04]  So that he could then act as a clean and righteous mediator on behalf of all the people.
[3009.04 --> 3016.04]  But on this one special day, the day of atonement that we read in Leviticus 16.
[3016.04 --> 3019.04]  There were two goats involved.
[3019.04 --> 3021.04]  One goat was sacrificed.
[3021.04 --> 3025.04]  And its blood was taken by Aaron behind the curtain.
[3026.04 --> 3031.04]  But Aaron took the other goat and he placed both of his hands on its head.
[3031.04 --> 3035.04]  And he spoke over it the sins of the people.
[3035.04 --> 3038.04]  And the goat was led off into the wilderness.
[3038.04 --> 3044.04]  And it's all a picture of what Jesus came to do as our mediator.
[3044.04 --> 3048.04]  And because there are two goats, it suggests that our redemption is twofold.
[3048.04 --> 3057.04]  Jesus paid the price for our sin with his own sacrifice, his own shed blood, that we couldn't manage to pay to God.
[3057.04 --> 3064.04]  And our sins have been separated from us as far as the east is to the west.
[3064.04 --> 3066.04]  They've been cast into the depths of the sea.
[3066.04 --> 3069.04]  And the point is that they can no longer return to us.
[3069.04 --> 3076.04]  So friends, as we conclude, what does this mean for our lives?
[3076.04 --> 3080.04]  What it means is that you are covered.
[3080.04 --> 3081.04]  Right?
[3081.04 --> 3085.04]  The Hebrew word for atonement is really best translated as covering.
[3085.04 --> 3090.04]  It's in like the sense of like, hey man, I got you covered.
[3090.04 --> 3094.04]  Or call in air cover.
[3094.04 --> 3095.04]  Right?
[3095.04 --> 3097.04]  It means that you are protected.
[3097.04 --> 3100.04]  Friends, that means that we are safe.
[3100.04 --> 3106.04]  Even when I sin, my high priest is faithful.
[3106.04 --> 3109.04]  He died for that sin as well.
[3109.04 --> 3119.04]  He stands in my place and on my behalf before the face of God the Father, so that in Jesus Christ you are already accepted by God.
[3119.04 --> 3122.04]  All the faith that you need, Jesus had for you.
[3122.04 --> 3126.04]  All the perfect life that you needed to live, he lived for you.
[3126.04 --> 3129.04]  This is recapitulation.
[3129.04 --> 3134.04]  So that we, through faith, we are united to Christ and we stand forgiven in him.
[3134.04 --> 3136.04]  This is the gospel.
[3136.04 --> 3138.04]  That means I am covered.
[3138.04 --> 3141.04]  It means that I am at one with God.
[3141.04 --> 3142.04]  Right?
[3142.04 --> 3144.04]  I don't need to be enslaved to fear anymore.
[3144.04 --> 3146.04]  You know, of course this takes time.
[3146.04 --> 3151.04]  It takes the work of God's Holy Spirit in us, working in us, growing us into this more and more.
[3151.04 --> 3154.04]  But friends, we have nothing to fear.
[3154.04 --> 3157.04]  That's what the cross of Christ has done for us.
[3157.04 --> 3159.04]  So let me pray for us.
[3159.04 --> 3168.04]  Father God, we thank you for this picture of the kaleidoscope.
[3168.04 --> 3174.04]  This turn where we see these different aspects of what the cross means.
[3174.04 --> 3179.04]  That you have come and you have set us free from slavery to death.
[3179.04 --> 3183.04]  You have set us free from the devil and his hold upon us.
[3183.04 --> 3185.04]  You have cast our sin away from us.
[3185.04 --> 3190.04]  You have died to satisfy the debt that we owe to God's good justice.
[3190.04 --> 3192.04]  Lord, all of these things have been done for us.
[3192.04 --> 3193.04]  Hallelujah.
[3193.04 --> 3198.04]  So Lord, we thank you for what you have done.
[3198.04 --> 3204.04]  And we pray that you would help us live in the freedom of the gospel that we have.
[3204.04 --> 3206.04]  Lord, change us.
[3206.04 --> 3210.04]  Help us know that even as we are on this journey, that we are free.
[3210.04 --> 3220.04]  And as we head to a promised land, a place where we, in our full redemption as human beings, body and soul, will live forever with you.
[3220.04 --> 3222.04]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3222.04 --> 3226.04]  Amen.
[3226.04 --> 3255.36]  We are people
[3256.04 --> 3258.90]  on a journey
[3258.90 --> 3260.58]  following
[3260.58 --> 3262.48]  where
[3262.48 --> 3266.02]  the Master walks.
[3266.46 --> 3268.40]  We are people
[3268.40 --> 3271.90]  on a journey
[3271.90 --> 3274.98]  in the shadow
[3274.98 --> 3279.12]  of the cross.
[3279.80 --> 3280.74]  What can
[3280.74 --> 3282.58]  bless
[3282.58 --> 3284.76]  the face of Jesus
[3284.76 --> 3288.42]  who protects
[3288.42 --> 3290.70]  our faithful
[3290.70 --> 3292.42]  God?
[3293.50 --> 3294.26]  He who
[3294.26 --> 3296.42]  treads the
[3296.42 --> 3299.50]  road of service,
[3300.08 --> 3300.62]  Christ
[3300.62 --> 3302.82]  the Lord
[3302.82 --> 3304.76]  let crucify.
[3304.76 --> 3315.92]  We are people
[3315.92 --> 3319.42]  on a journey
[3319.42 --> 3322.42]  taking up
[3322.42 --> 3326.60]  the cross of Christ.
[3326.60 --> 3328.60]  We are people
[3328.60 --> 3332.46]  on a journey
[3332.46 --> 3334.60]  moving on
[3336.26 --> 3338.60]  from death to life.
[3340.26 --> 3342.34]  We release
[3342.34 --> 3346.54]  the sin that takes us.
[3346.54 --> 3350.20]  We relinquish
[3350.20 --> 3351.38]  all
[3351.38 --> 3352.20]  acclaim
[3352.20 --> 3355.20]  We receive
[3355.98 --> 3358.20]  the suffering
[3358.20 --> 3359.54]  Savior
[3359.54 --> 3362.20]  He our glory
[3362.20 --> 3365.48]  will be.
[3365.48 --> 3376.64]  we are people
[3376.64 --> 3380.14]  on a journey
[3380.14 --> 3383.48]  rising up
[3383.48 --> 3385.58]  in life
[3385.58 --> 3386.48]  reborn
[3386.48 --> 3390.14]  we are people
[3390.14 --> 3392.14]  on a journey
[3392.14 --> 3393.14]  on a journey
[3393.14 --> 3394.14]  on a journey
[3394.14 --> 3395.58]  swinging
[3395.58 --> 3397.64]  swinging peace
[3397.64 --> 3399.80]  accepting score
[3399.80 --> 3403.46]  we are walking
[3403.46 --> 3406.62]  toward our home
[3406.62 --> 3408.18]  light
[3408.18 --> 3411.46]  to a mystery
[3411.46 --> 3413.46]  yet unknown
[3413.46 --> 3417.62]  to a kingdom
[3417.62 --> 3421.14]  coming quickly
[3421.14 --> 3425.44]  to the light
[3425.44 --> 3428.14]  of God's own throne
[3428.14 --> 3429.04]  love
[3429.04 --> 3443.46]  Please join me
[3443.46 --> 3445.30]  in this prayer.
[3451.38 --> 3452.66]  Heavenly Father
[3452.66 --> 3455.46]  You lovingly
[3455.46 --> 3457.14]  hold life
[3457.14 --> 3457.92]  and death
[3457.92 --> 3458.72]  in your hands
[3458.72 --> 3460.66]  You uphold
[3460.66 --> 3461.18]  and govern
[3461.18 --> 3461.98]  your creation
[3461.98 --> 3462.76]  by your
[3462.76 --> 3463.84]  eternal counsel
[3463.84 --> 3465.06]  and your
[3465.06 --> 3466.04]  good providence
[3466.04 --> 3467.94]  Show us
[3467.94 --> 3468.76]  and remind us
[3468.76 --> 3469.60]  of your constant
[3469.60 --> 3470.68]  care for us
[3470.68 --> 3471.24]  your people
[3471.24 --> 3475.04]  Jesus our Lord
[3475.04 --> 3476.22]  through you
[3476.22 --> 3477.28]  all things were created
[3477.28 --> 3477.98]  and you uphold
[3477.98 --> 3478.68]  all things
[3478.68 --> 3480.02]  by the word
[3480.02 --> 3480.72]  of your power
[3480.72 --> 3482.50]  Show us
[3482.50 --> 3483.56]  and remind us
[3483.56 --> 3484.58]  of your complete
[3484.58 --> 3485.38]  control over
[3485.38 --> 3486.32]  all that comes
[3486.32 --> 3486.88]  to pass
[3486.88 --> 3489.24]  and Holy Spirit
[3489.24 --> 3489.88]  teach us
[3489.88 --> 3490.36]  and apply
[3490.36 --> 3491.02]  your truth
[3491.02 --> 3491.46]  deeply
[3491.46 --> 3492.76]  to our hearts
[3492.76 --> 3494.16]  and help us
[3494.16 --> 3494.62]  to walk
[3494.62 --> 3495.18]  by faith
[3495.18 --> 3496.16]  each and every
[3496.16 --> 3496.50]  day
[3496.50 --> 3497.74]  to follow
[3497.74 --> 3498.58]  in the shadow
[3498.58 --> 3499.30]  of the cross
[3499.30 --> 3499.94]  and follow
[3499.94 --> 3501.18]  Christ our
[3501.18 --> 3501.58]  crucified
[3501.58 --> 3502.54]  Savior
[3502.54 --> 3505.16]  Lord hear the
[3505.16 --> 3505.82]  cries of your
[3505.82 --> 3506.18]  people
[3506.18 --> 3508.02]  like King David
[3508.02 --> 3508.68]  cries out
[3508.68 --> 3509.56]  in Psalm 25
[3509.56 --> 3510.40]  the troubles
[3510.40 --> 3511.68]  of our hearts
[3511.68 --> 3512.66]  are enlarged
[3512.66 --> 3514.42]  Lord bring us
[3514.42 --> 3515.52]  out of our
[3515.52 --> 3516.02]  distress
[3516.02 --> 3518.16]  so again
[3518.16 --> 3518.88]  we ask that
[3518.88 --> 3519.36]  you would have
[3519.36 --> 3520.08]  mercy on your
[3520.08 --> 3520.88]  world and bring
[3520.88 --> 3521.92]  an end to
[3521.92 --> 3523.58]  the COVID-19
[3523.58 --> 3524.08]  pandemic
[3524.08 --> 3526.02]  give perseverance
[3526.02 --> 3528.02]  to all of us
[3528.02 --> 3529.86]  especially those
[3529.86 --> 3530.98]  in the medical
[3530.98 --> 3531.68]  and research
[3531.68 --> 3532.30]  world
[3532.30 --> 3533.66]  and those who
[3533.66 --> 3534.18]  are on the
[3534.18 --> 3534.92]  front lines of
[3534.92 --> 3535.72]  treating the sick
[3535.72 --> 3538.08]  we pray
[3538.08 --> 3539.26]  for our
[3539.26 --> 3539.68]  government
[3539.68 --> 3540.24]  officials
[3540.24 --> 3540.84]  we pray
[3540.84 --> 3541.44]  that they
[3541.44 --> 3542.80]  that you
[3542.80 --> 3543.60]  would give
[3543.60 --> 3544.42]  them wisdom
[3544.42 --> 3545.62]  transparency
[3545.62 --> 3546.54]  and humility
[3546.54 --> 3547.70]  as they seek
[3547.70 --> 3548.26]  to serve
[3548.26 --> 3549.70]  and we pray
[3549.70 --> 3550.04]  that they
[3550.04 --> 3550.50]  would grant
[3550.50 --> 3551.00]  the freedom
[3551.00 --> 3551.56]  for churches
[3551.56 --> 3552.12]  to worship
[3552.12 --> 3553.10]  again in person
[3553.10 --> 3553.50]  soon
[3553.50 --> 3556.68]  father in this
[3556.68 --> 3557.62]  time we pray

[3558.58 --> 3559.80]  children of
[3559.80 --> 3560.54]  our congregation
[3560.54 --> 3562.20]  we pray for
[3562.20 --> 3562.92]  their parents
[3562.92 --> 3563.94]  as well
[3563.94 --> 3565.16]  that you would
[3565.16 --> 3565.86]  turn hearts
[3565.86 --> 3566.52]  toward you
[3566.52 --> 3566.88]  and help
[3566.88 --> 3567.50]  families to
[3567.50 --> 3568.10]  stay connected
[3568.10 --> 3568.68]  to you
[3568.68 --> 3570.32]  in this time
[3570.32 --> 3571.26]  when we can't
[3571.26 --> 3571.70]  be together
[3571.70 --> 3572.22]  in person
[3572.22 --> 3573.62]  when Sunday
[3573.62 --> 3574.98]  school is on
[3574.98 --> 3575.76]  Zoom and when

[3586.74 --> 3587.32]  this challenging
[3587.32 --> 3587.78]  time
[3587.78 --> 3590.28]  Lord we pray
[3590.28 --> 3590.76]  that you would
[3590.76 --> 3591.14]  help your

[3593.76 --> 3594.38]  place where
