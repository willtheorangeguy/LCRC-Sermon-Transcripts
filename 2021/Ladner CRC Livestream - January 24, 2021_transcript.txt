[309.48 --> 312.48]  Good morning, everyone and welcome to Latin Earth Christian.
[312.48 --> 313.48]  Sure.
[313.48 --> 319.10]  And wherever you are, we are so glad that you've joined us and that you can worship along with
[319.10 --> 327.58]  us in our live stream Sunday morning worship service. Today as an announcement is Cadet Sunday
[327.58 --> 334.98]  and as many of you will know the cadets is a ministry of our church for boys in grades three
[334.98 --> 342.86]  to seven and often on club nights they would have bible lessons, they will do learn some skills like
[342.86 --> 349.38]  woodworking and maybe go out and do some outdoor activities. Unfortunately a lot of that has been
[349.38 --> 357.52]  closed down because of the pandemic but it's still a vital ministry to our children and not only in our
[357.52 --> 362.72]  church but also in our neighborhood and so later in the service we will also see a short video that
[362.72 --> 367.52]  will tell us more about that ministry and so our designated offering this Sunday is for the cadets
[367.52 --> 373.86]  and you can give online on our website or you can also drop off a check or mail it in here to the
[373.86 --> 382.52]  church. So we begin this morning with our call to worship the Lord the God of the universe calls us
[382.52 --> 390.52]  as his people to worship him and so where you see the words in bold I invite you to participate and
[390.52 --> 402.44]  to say them out loud at home. Know that the Lord he is God it is he who made us and we are his we are his
[402.44 --> 411.54]  people and the sheep of his pasture enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise give thanks
[411.54 --> 422.84]  to him bless his name for the Lord is good his steadfast love endures forever and his faithfulness to all
[422.84 --> 433.40]  generations praise the Lord. And so our Lord has called us to worship and now he greets us with these words
[433.40 --> 441.12]  from Isaiah 40. See the sovereign Lord comes with power and he rules with a mighty arm.
[441.54 --> 447.66]  See his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him. He tends his flock like a shepherd.
[448.38 --> 455.38]  He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart. He gently leads those who have
[455.38 --> 455.92]  young.
[458.98 --> 466.30]  And as God has called us and he has greeted us with his peace let us greet one another with that same peace.
[466.30 --> 468.60]  And so may the peace of the Lord be with you.
[469.48 --> 470.70]  And also with you.
[471.78 --> 479.36]  And so let us respond to God's call. Let's respond to his welcome to us in greeting first with a prayer of adoration.
[480.08 --> 481.30]  And so would you join me in prayer.
[482.54 --> 487.54]  Our Heavenly Father we praise you this morning for creating this world in all of its beauty.
[487.54 --> 492.30]  We praise you for redeeming the world through Christ our Lord.
[493.02 --> 498.24]  And for sending us the gift of your spirit to come and give us life.
[498.74 --> 500.64]  To encourage us and instruct us.
[501.04 --> 504.62]  And to sustain us for following our Lord Jesus.
[506.22 --> 510.60]  Father we long for your spirit to work among us now as we worship you.
[511.16 --> 512.90]  To inspire our praise.
[513.06 --> 514.72]  To transform us with your truth.
[514.72 --> 518.58]  And Lord then to equip us to live for you in this world.
[519.86 --> 522.12]  And so be with us now and receive our praise.
[522.22 --> 524.08]  And we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[524.58 --> 524.88]  Amen.
[524.88 --> 524.98]  Amen.
[524.98 --> 535.02]  Amen.
[535.02 --> 537.26]  Amen.
[537.26 --> 541.48]  Amen.
[541.48 --> 542.34]  I am.
[542.34 --> 552.08]  Come away from rushing hurry, to the stillness of God's peace.
[552.08 --> 562.50]  From our vain ambition's glory, come to Christ, to my dreams.
[562.50 --> 572.86]  Come away from Christ and power, life's demands and threats in grace.
[573.24 --> 584.04]  Come to join the people gather, here to seek and find God's grace.
[584.04 --> 595.04]  In the pastures of God's goodness, we lie down to rest our souls.
[596.24 --> 605.04]  In the waters of God's mercy, we drink deeply, are made whole.
[605.04 --> 616.02]  At the table of God's presence, all the saints are richly fed.
[616.38 --> 625.76]  With the order of God's anointing, into service we are led.
[625.76 --> 638.96]  Come, the children, with your brothers, as the fish shows the things that came.
[638.96 --> 649.72]  Leave them at the cross of Jesus, and take instead of his kingdom's grave.
[649.72 --> 658.72]  When your thirst for him and quenched them, we have hope will satisfy.
[658.72 --> 671.72]  Our wrongings find a day, when to self-reep and redire.
[671.72 --> 682.46]  Our right is done to let you out.
[682.46 --> 684.34]  The shade will be dead.
[684.34 --> 684.72]  Take now.
[684.72 --> 688.32]  The water will also be moved across the coule of God.
[688.34 --> 690.84]  You learn what will thunder will manifest.
[690.92 --> 693.64]  It will raise God's grace.
[693.64 --> 697.52]  In the wildvär прин tilting to confirmations.
[697.52 --> 718.60]  Hi, I like having my own cubby and I like cutting the wood with the jigsaw.
[721.16 --> 725.74]  What I liked about cadets is how we did the woodworking and the Bible lessons.
[727.52 --> 736.92]  Cadets salute the Canadian flag. Cadets recite your pledge to the flag.
[736.92 --> 746.52]  I pledge allegiance to the Canadian flag and to the dominion for which it stands, one nation under God, invisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[746.52 --> 751.88]  Cadets salute the cadet flag. Cadets recite your pledge.
[751.88 --> 761.28]  Thankful to God for his gifts to me, I pledge myself to be ready to serve God, my parents, my country, my church, my neighbors, and my courts.
[761.28 --> 764.28]  Cadets recite your verse.
[764.28 --> 769.68]  If you love me, you'll keep my commands. John 14 verse 15.
[769.68 --> 771.68]  Cadets recite your code.
[771.68 --> 781.68]  A cadet must be reverent, obedient, compassionate, concentrated, trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, and cheerful.
[781.68 --> 783.68]  Cadets recite your motto.
[783.68 --> 786.08]  Moving forward Jesus!
[786.08 --> 787.08]  Moving forward Jesus!
[787.08 --> 789.08]  Amor!
[790.48 --> 790.88]  With you.
[806.48 --> 808.48]  AmorINE
[808.48 --> 818.48]  .
[818.48 --> 825.48]  Living for Jesus, a life that is true,
[825.48 --> 832.48]  striving to please him in all that I do,
[832.48 --> 840.48]  healing allegiance, glad-hearted and free.
[840.48 --> 847.48]  This is the pathway of blessing for me.
[847.48 --> 855.48]  O Jesus, Lord and Savior, I give myself to you.
[855.48 --> 863.48]  For you in your own children, take yourself for me.
[863.48 --> 871.48]  I am the Lord of the Master, my heart shall be your crown.
[871.48 --> 877.48]  My life I'm finished for to live.
[877.48 --> 883.48]  O Christ, for you alone.
[883.48 --> 891.48]  Living for Jesus wherever I am,
[891.48 --> 898.48]  Doing each duty in his holy name,
[898.48 --> 906.48]  Seeking the lost ones he died to redeem,
[906.48 --> 914.48]  Bring me, Lord, we wait to find rest in him.
[914.48 --> 922.48]  O Jesus, God and Savior, I give myself to you.
[922.48 --> 931.48]  For you in your own children, take yourself for me.
[931.48 --> 939.48]  My own Lord of the Master, my heart shall be your crown.
[939.48 --> 945.48]  My life I will never live.
[945.48 --> 949.48]  O Christ, for you alone.
[949.48 --> 955.48]  My own Lord of the Master, my heart shall be your crown.
[955.48 --> 959.48]  In preparing for this next song, entitled,
[959.48 --> 961.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind,
[961.48 --> 966.48]  These comforting words from Matthew 11, verse 28, came to mind.
[966.48 --> 974.48]  Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[974.48 --> 983.48]  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[983.48 --> 988.48]  The song's chorus also has these comforting words.
[988.48 --> 991.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[991.48 --> 994.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[994.48 --> 997.48]  We can always run to Jesus.
[997.48 --> 1000.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1000.48 --> 1013.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1013.48 --> 1014.48]  Jesus said,
[1014.48 --> 1017.48]  And if I thirst,
[1017.48 --> 1022.48]  I should come to him.
[1022.48 --> 1028.48]  No one else can satisfy,
[1028.48 --> 1033.48]  I should come to him.
[1033.48 --> 1035.48]  Jesus said,
[1035.48 --> 1038.48]  If I am weak,
[1038.48 --> 1044.48]  I should come to him.
[1044.48 --> 1049.48]  No one else can be my strength,
[1049.48 --> 1054.48]  I should come to him.
[1054.48 --> 1059.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1059.48 --> 1064.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[1064.48 --> 1071.48]  We can always run to Jesus.
[1071.48 --> 1077.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1077.48 --> 1078.48]  Jesus said,
[1078.48 --> 1079.48]  Jesus said,
[1079.48 --> 1080.48]  Jesus said,
[1080.48 --> 1082.48]  That if I fear,
[1082.48 --> 1087.48]  I should come to him.
[1087.48 --> 1093.48]  No one else can be my shield,
[1093.48 --> 1098.48]  I should come to him.
[1098.48 --> 1103.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1103.48 --> 1108.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[1108.48 --> 1115.48]  We can always run to Jesus.
[1115.48 --> 1120.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1120.48 --> 1121.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1121.48 --> 1123.48]  Jesus said,
[1123.48 --> 1126.48]  If I am lost,
[1126.48 --> 1127.48]  He will come to me.
[1127.48 --> 1128.48]  If I am lost,
[1128.48 --> 1133.48]  He will come to me.
[1133.48 --> 1138.48]  And he shall be on that cross.
[1138.48 --> 1142.48]  He will come to me.
[1142.48 --> 1147.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1147.48 --> 1152.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[1152.48 --> 1157.48]  We can always run to Jesus.
[1157.48 --> 1162.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1162.48 --> 1165.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1165.48 --> 1167.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[1167.48 --> 1169.48]  For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1169.48 --> 1174.48]  He will keep us day and night.
[1174.48 --> 1180.48]  We can always run to Jesus.
[1180.48 --> 1186.48]  Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1190.48 --> 1196.48]  So we'll continue to worship the Lord this morning together with a time of confession and assurance.
[1197.48 --> 1200.48]  Isaiah 53 verse 6 says,
[1200.48 --> 1204.48]  We all, like sheep, have gone astray.
[1204.48 --> 1207.48]  Each one of us has turned to our own way.
[1207.48 --> 1212.48]  So would you please read aloud this prayer of confession with me where it says bold.
[1212.48 --> 1214.48]  I'll ask you to read it.
[1214.48 --> 1219.48]  Our gracious shepherd and our God,
[1219.48 --> 1222.48]  We cry out to you for mercy.
[1222.48 --> 1228.48]  You have called us to follow you with faith and hope wherever you lead us.
[1228.48 --> 1235.48]  But at times we have turned aside from your way and foolishly trusted ourselves.
[1235.48 --> 1238.48]  Our gracious shepherd and our God,
[1238.48 --> 1243.48]  Remind us that we are your children and fill us with your spirit,
[1243.48 --> 1248.48]  So that our lives might always be faithful and fruitful.
[1248.48 --> 1258.48]  Now hear these words of assurance and receive these words of grace from 1 Peter chapter 2.
[1258.48 --> 1263.48]  He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross,
[1263.48 --> 1267.48]  So that we might die to sin and live for righteousness.
[1267.48 --> 1270.48]  By his wounds you have been healed.
[1270.48 --> 1273.48]  For you were like sheep going astray,
[1273.48 --> 1280.48]  But now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
[1280.48 --> 1287.48]  Thanks be to God.
[1287.48 --> 1289.48]  Amen.
[1317.48 --> 1323.48]  Praise that in sin is our sin and our guilt.
[1324.04 --> 1329.66]  Yonder of Calvary's land are born.
[1329.66 --> 1336.26]  There the blood of the land was spilled.
[1337.02 --> 1342.84]  Praise is God's grace.
[1342.84 --> 1349.04]  Praise that will pardon and cleanse us with Him.
[1349.54 --> 1355.32]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1355.32 --> 1362.22]  Praise that is greater than all our sin.
[1364.00 --> 1370.02]  Dark is the stain that we cannot hide.
[1370.02 --> 1375.86]  What can avail to wash it away.
[1376.42 --> 1382.00]  Lord, there is flowing the crimson tide.
[1382.56 --> 1387.02]  Wider than snow you may be today.
[1388.66 --> 1394.46]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1394.46 --> 1400.20]  Praise that will pardon and cleanse within.
[1400.76 --> 1406.56]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1407.10 --> 1412.46]  Praise that is greater than all our sin.
[1412.46 --> 1415.44]  guide to our sin.
[1415.44 --> 1417.94]  All the sin.

[1447.56 --> 1453.60]  Grace that will body and bless within

[1459.54 --> 1467.84]  Grace that is free to bear all of us here
[1467.84 --> 1476.04]  Good morning again.
[1476.86 --> 1481.48]  And today we're going to continue in our series on the I Am Sayings of Jesus
[1481.48 --> 1483.40]  in the Gospel of John.
[1483.78 --> 1487.38]  And today we're going to consider two of those statements,
[1487.66 --> 1488.90]  so there are seven in total,
[1489.62 --> 1493.82]  and we're going to consider two today that actually are combined and they belong together.
[1494.36 --> 1498.26]  And it's that I am the gate and I am the good shepherd.
[1499.04 --> 1501.68]  So today we are in John chapter 10.
[1501.86 --> 1505.86]  We'll be reading verses 1 through 15 and we'll have that on the screen here.
[1506.96 --> 1509.74]  So please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1511.74 --> 1514.16]  Very truly I tell you Pharisees,
[1514.16 --> 1517.58]  anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate,
[1517.58 --> 1519.90]  but climbs in by some other way,
[1520.30 --> 1521.92]  is a thief and a robber.
[1522.50 --> 1524.50]  The one who enters by the gate
[1524.50 --> 1526.72]  is the shepherd of the sheep.
[1528.00 --> 1530.38]  The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
[1530.38 --> 1532.14]  and the sheep listen to his voice.
[1532.86 --> 1534.96]  He calls his own sheep by name
[1534.96 --> 1535.98]  and leads them out.
[1536.50 --> 1538.44]  When he has brought out all of his own,
[1538.54 --> 1539.68]  he goes on ahead of them
[1539.68 --> 1541.78]  and his sheep follow him
[1541.78 --> 1544.02]  because they know his voice.
[1545.06 --> 1547.10]  But they will never follow a stranger.
[1547.90 --> 1549.64]  In fact, they will run away from him
[1549.64 --> 1552.36]  because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.
[1553.32 --> 1555.34]  Jesus used this figure of speech,
[1555.50 --> 1558.20]  but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.
[1558.20 --> 1560.66]  Therefore, Jesus said again,
[1560.92 --> 1562.56]  Very truly I tell you,
[1562.68 --> 1564.60]  I am the gate for the sheep.
[1565.96 --> 1567.76]  All who have come before me
[1567.76 --> 1569.74]  are thieves and robbers,
[1570.04 --> 1572.10]  but the sheep have not listened to them.
[1572.82 --> 1573.76]  I am the gate.
[1573.88 --> 1575.18]  Whoever enters through me
[1575.18 --> 1576.56]  will be saved.
[1577.34 --> 1579.30]  They will come in and go out
[1579.30 --> 1581.04]  and find pasture.
[1582.06 --> 1583.80]  The thief comes only to steal
[1583.80 --> 1584.98]  and kill and destroy.
[1584.98 --> 1588.52]  I have come that they may have life
[1588.52 --> 1590.40]  and have it to the full.
[1590.98 --> 1592.06]  I am the good shepherd.
[1592.28 --> 1594.90]  The good shepherd lays down his life
[1594.90 --> 1596.24]  for the sheep.
[1596.66 --> 1599.10]  The hired hand is not the shepherd
[1599.10 --> 1600.86]  and does not own the sheep.
[1601.44 --> 1602.86]  So when he sees the wolf coming,
[1603.00 --> 1604.80]  he abandons the sheep and runs away.
[1605.28 --> 1607.76]  Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
[1608.26 --> 1610.82]  The man runs away because he is a hired hand
[1610.82 --> 1612.62]  and cares nothing for the sheep.
[1612.62 --> 1615.30]  I am the good shepherd.
[1615.68 --> 1618.84]  I know my sheep and my sheep know me.
[1619.26 --> 1620.84]  Just as the father knows me
[1620.84 --> 1621.94]  and I know the father
[1621.94 --> 1625.38]  and I lay down my life for the sheep.
[1627.88 --> 1629.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1629.94 --> 1631.96]  So would you please pray with me as we begin?
[1634.16 --> 1635.22]  Our heavenly father,
[1635.52 --> 1636.50]  you are the good shepherd
[1636.50 --> 1638.14]  and we are your sheep.
[1638.14 --> 1643.96]  Lord, it's a mysterious metaphor that you use
[1643.96 --> 1645.82]  and would you this morning
[1645.82 --> 1647.12]  as we read this passage,
[1648.02 --> 1649.24]  as we open your word,
[1649.38 --> 1650.68]  would you teach us what you mean?
[1650.74 --> 1651.98]  The Pharisees were confused.
[1653.00 --> 1654.66]  Father, we can be confused sometimes
[1654.66 --> 1655.70]  when we read your word
[1655.70 --> 1657.16]  and so we need your Holy Spirit.
[1658.56 --> 1661.18]  And you promise that you will bring to mind
[1661.18 --> 1664.58]  all that you write to us in your word.
[1664.58 --> 1666.58]  And so Lord, would you open our hearts
[1666.58 --> 1668.10]  as your disciples,
[1668.34 --> 1670.36]  would you help us to hear your voice?
[1670.60 --> 1671.66]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1672.14 --> 1672.42]  Amen.
[1674.04 --> 1676.80]  So my children's elementary school
[1676.80 --> 1678.34]  has two playgrounds.
[1678.46 --> 1679.88]  There's kind of a big playground
[1679.88 --> 1681.14]  for the older kids.
[1681.66 --> 1682.86]  There's a smaller playground
[1682.86 --> 1683.66]  for the younger kids.
[1684.72 --> 1687.00]  And when the kids go out to recess,
[1687.80 --> 1689.64]  there'll be several classes together
[1689.64 --> 1690.58]  playing at the playground.
[1690.72 --> 1692.36]  And I've tried to ask them about this
[1692.36 --> 1693.20]  and they explain it to me.
[1694.14 --> 1695.36]  And what will happen is
[1695.36 --> 1696.66]  when it's time to go back in,
[1696.76 --> 1698.02]  the teacher will come out,
[1698.18 --> 1698.80]  blow a whistle,
[1699.40 --> 1701.70]  and if you hear the whistle
[1701.70 --> 1702.56]  and you look up
[1702.56 --> 1704.22]  and you see that it is your teacher,
[1704.92 --> 1706.86]  you're supposed to stop playing,
[1707.00 --> 1707.62]  stop your game,
[1708.02 --> 1710.12]  and go line up with your teacher
[1710.12 --> 1711.34]  to go inside.
[1712.64 --> 1714.34]  And if it's not your teacher
[1714.34 --> 1715.80]  that is calling,
[1716.42 --> 1718.66]  you can actually just keep playing.
[1718.84 --> 1719.84]  You can go on playing.
[1719.84 --> 1722.58]  I've even heard that some schools,
[1723.14 --> 1724.44]  the teachers will even have
[1724.44 --> 1725.42]  a special song.
[1725.92 --> 1727.06]  So they'll sing the song
[1727.06 --> 1728.50]  and if the student hears
[1728.50 --> 1729.94]  the song of their teacher,
[1730.20 --> 1731.60]  their special class song,
[1732.06 --> 1733.92]  then they stop playing
[1733.92 --> 1735.48]  and they go and they form a line
[1735.48 --> 1737.58]  and they get ready to follow the teacher.
[1738.20 --> 1739.62]  When you hear your teacher,
[1740.20 --> 1741.44]  you perk up your ears
[1741.44 --> 1742.72]  and you follow.
[1744.02 --> 1745.42]  Now in John chapter 10,
[1745.54 --> 1746.56]  Jesus is telling us
[1746.56 --> 1747.56]  something very important.
[1747.56 --> 1749.64]  And he's saying that it's not just
[1749.64 --> 1751.06]  elementary schools
[1751.06 --> 1752.64]  that work like this.
[1753.10 --> 1755.18]  But in the whole world,
[1755.80 --> 1756.74]  there are teachers.
[1757.64 --> 1759.00]  And there are people
[1759.00 --> 1760.86]  singing songs.
[1761.64 --> 1763.06]  And there are different people
[1763.06 --> 1764.50]  listening to different songs.
[1765.32 --> 1767.94]  And when your song is sung,
[1768.48 --> 1770.68]  when the teacher that you follow
[1770.68 --> 1772.26]  or that you look up to
[1772.26 --> 1773.24]  or listen to,
[1774.14 --> 1775.44]  whose song you like,
[1775.44 --> 1777.44]  when they sing or when they call,
[1778.10 --> 1778.98]  you listen
[1778.98 --> 1781.04]  and you follow that person.
[1782.16 --> 1783.58]  You know, I think for some of us,
[1783.90 --> 1785.70]  when someone or something
[1785.70 --> 1786.66]  in our culture,
[1787.42 --> 1788.54]  in the world,
[1788.64 --> 1790.66]  they sing the song of security
[1790.66 --> 1792.12]  or predictability,
[1792.46 --> 1794.20]  we perk up our heads
[1794.20 --> 1796.54]  and we line up behind that teacher.
[1797.62 --> 1798.76]  For others of us,
[1798.80 --> 1800.88]  when someone or something
[1800.88 --> 1803.04]  sings the song of fun
[1803.04 --> 1804.98]  and pleasure and adventure,
[1805.76 --> 1806.88]  we listen carefully.
[1807.58 --> 1807.72]  You know,
[1807.76 --> 1809.54]  if someone's going to deliver us
[1809.54 --> 1810.48]  from the mundane
[1810.48 --> 1811.40]  and the boring,
[1811.60 --> 1812.52]  we're all in.
[1813.86 --> 1816.18]  Some of us are very attuned
[1816.18 --> 1817.32]  to any voice
[1817.32 --> 1818.66]  that will give us a sense
[1818.66 --> 1820.32]  of identity and purpose
[1820.32 --> 1821.00]  in our lives.
[1821.66 --> 1823.16]  Something that will give us
[1823.16 --> 1825.30]  a tribe to belong to.
[1825.40 --> 1825.56]  You know,
[1825.62 --> 1827.04]  whether it's a political party,
[1827.74 --> 1829.32]  whether it's an ideology,
[1829.32 --> 1831.38]  whether it's a brand.
[1832.92 --> 1834.12]  See, according to Jesus
[1834.12 --> 1834.90]  in this passage,
[1835.02 --> 1835.98]  the question is not
[1835.98 --> 1838.42]  whether we will respond
[1838.42 --> 1840.02]  to a song or not.
[1840.58 --> 1842.22]  The question Jesus
[1842.22 --> 1843.98]  brings forward here
[1843.98 --> 1846.90]  is which kind of song
[1846.90 --> 1848.28]  will you respond to?
[1849.26 --> 1850.42]  Because in the playground
[1850.42 --> 1851.38]  of the world,
[1852.38 --> 1854.08]  which song
[1854.08 --> 1856.06]  is going to catch your ear?
[1856.96 --> 1857.08]  Right?
[1857.20 --> 1858.24]  Which shepherd
[1858.24 --> 1859.66]  are you going to follow?
[1860.74 --> 1861.34]  And of course,
[1861.44 --> 1861.60]  you know,
[1861.66 --> 1862.68]  Jesus in this passage
[1862.68 --> 1864.46]  isn't using the language
[1864.46 --> 1866.54]  of elementary classes.
[1866.54 --> 1867.84]  He's using the language
[1867.84 --> 1868.44]  of sheep
[1868.44 --> 1870.10]  and of shepherds
[1870.10 --> 1870.92]  and of sheep pen.
[1871.64 --> 1873.28]  But the underlying point
[1873.28 --> 1874.22]  is the same
[1874.22 --> 1875.38]  and it's unmistakable
[1875.38 --> 1877.56]  that it matters
[1877.56 --> 1879.14]  who you listen to.
[1880.46 --> 1881.40]  And so today
[1881.40 --> 1882.44]  as we look at this text,
[1882.48 --> 1883.20]  we're going to look at it
[1883.20 --> 1884.04]  in three parts.
[1884.04 --> 1886.12]  When Jesus says,
[1886.44 --> 1887.30]  I am the good shepherd,
[1887.64 --> 1888.68]  we want to ask
[1888.68 --> 1889.44]  three questions.
[1889.64 --> 1889.94]  First,
[1890.50 --> 1891.98]  what does he mean by that?
[1892.42 --> 1893.10]  What does it mean
[1893.10 --> 1894.54]  that he is the good shepherd?
[1895.20 --> 1896.54]  What is he like?
[1896.96 --> 1897.90]  And then how do we listen
[1897.90 --> 1898.82]  to the song of Jesus?
[1899.26 --> 1900.00]  So the first one,
[1900.12 --> 1901.14]  what does he mean?
[1903.32 --> 1904.20]  Jesus says,
[1904.38 --> 1906.04]  I am the good shepherd.
[1907.04 --> 1908.44]  He says it several times
[1908.44 --> 1909.02]  in this passage,
[1909.10 --> 1909.94]  at least twice,
[1910.28 --> 1911.20]  seemingly for emphasis.
[1912.30 --> 1913.82]  And now the text opens
[1913.82 --> 1914.70]  in verse one
[1914.70 --> 1916.24]  with a warning
[1916.24 --> 1916.98]  from Jesus
[1916.98 --> 1917.82]  about a man
[1917.82 --> 1919.22]  who doesn't enter
[1919.22 --> 1920.02]  the sheep pen
[1920.02 --> 1920.86]  by the gate
[1920.86 --> 1922.46]  like a true shepherd would,
[1922.76 --> 1924.36]  but instead he climbs in
[1924.36 --> 1925.34]  from some other way.
[1926.12 --> 1926.86]  And Jesus says,
[1927.06 --> 1927.72]  that man
[1927.72 --> 1929.32]  isn't the true shepherd,
[1929.46 --> 1930.44]  but he is a thief
[1930.44 --> 1931.34]  and a robber.
[1932.92 --> 1933.40]  Now,
[1933.54 --> 1934.46]  this text isn't going
[1934.46 --> 1935.58]  to make much sense to us
[1935.58 --> 1936.50]  unless we have a bit
[1936.50 --> 1938.20]  of cultural understanding
[1938.20 --> 1939.82]  to get the metaphor
[1939.82 --> 1941.50]  that Jesus is working with here.
[1941.50 --> 1943.30]  I personally
[1943.30 --> 1945.54]  don't have any knowledge
[1945.54 --> 1947.58]  about sheep firsthand,
[1948.38 --> 1950.14]  but the reference books
[1950.14 --> 1951.18]  are really helpful.
[1952.14 --> 1953.46]  And they tell us this,
[1953.46 --> 1955.30]  that in the ancient Near East,
[1955.98 --> 1957.62]  shepherds would herd
[1957.62 --> 1959.26]  their sheep each night
[1959.26 --> 1961.98]  into a walled enclosure
[1961.98 --> 1963.08]  for protection.
[1963.08 --> 1965.70]  And most families
[1965.70 --> 1966.94]  who owned some sheep
[1966.94 --> 1969.16]  wouldn't have their own farm.
[1970.20 --> 1971.02]  So they'd have
[1971.02 --> 1972.08]  these walled enclosures.
[1972.32 --> 1973.24]  They were made of stone
[1973.24 --> 1974.32]  about waist high.
[1974.58 --> 1976.14]  And these walled enclosures
[1976.14 --> 1976.86]  were shared
[1976.86 --> 1978.32]  by several families,
[1978.76 --> 1979.84]  several flocks of sheep.
[1980.56 --> 1981.66]  And so they would build
[1981.66 --> 1982.74]  one small opening
[1982.74 --> 1983.56]  with a gate.
[1983.56 --> 1985.20]  And at dusk,
[1985.30 --> 1986.18]  the shepherds would,
[1986.34 --> 1986.84]  you know,
[1987.00 --> 1987.94]  would herd their flocks
[1987.94 --> 1988.40]  of sheep
[1988.40 --> 1990.68]  into the pen
[1990.68 --> 1991.64]  through this opening
[1991.64 --> 1993.12]  and they would go in there
[1993.12 --> 1993.82]  and mingle with
[1993.82 --> 1994.78]  all the other sheep.
[1996.22 --> 1997.56]  And so multiple shepherds
[1997.56 --> 1998.52]  would come together.
[1999.32 --> 2000.18]  And then they would make
[2000.18 --> 2000.86]  one of them,
[2000.96 --> 2001.10]  you know,
[2001.16 --> 2002.10]  I'm guessing probably
[2002.10 --> 2002.90]  the youngest,
[2003.50 --> 2004.18]  they would make them
[2004.18 --> 2004.94]  be a watchman.
[2005.14 --> 2005.78]  So that shepherd
[2005.78 --> 2006.46]  would have to kind of
[2006.46 --> 2007.64]  sleep across the gate,
[2007.80 --> 2008.96]  sleep across the door,
[2009.16 --> 2010.52]  and to stay alert
[2010.52 --> 2011.90]  so that if there was danger,
[2011.90 --> 2013.02]  a thief, a robber,
[2013.20 --> 2014.76]  or maybe a predator,
[2015.24 --> 2016.26]  they would kind of
[2016.26 --> 2017.12]  sound the alarm
[2017.12 --> 2018.78]  and keep watch
[2018.78 --> 2021.02]  in case any danger happens.
[2022.52 --> 2023.52]  Well, then in the morning,
[2024.02 --> 2025.18]  when everyone wakes up,
[2025.24 --> 2025.96]  the shepherds
[2025.96 --> 2027.96]  would call their flock
[2027.96 --> 2030.14]  out of the sheep pen
[2030.14 --> 2031.02]  one by one.
[2031.82 --> 2032.80]  Sometimes they would
[2032.80 --> 2033.94]  play a song on a flute,
[2034.58 --> 2036.26]  they might sing a song,
[2036.28 --> 2036.98]  or they would just
[2036.98 --> 2038.68]  call out to the sheep.
[2039.38 --> 2040.48]  And the flock
[2040.48 --> 2041.78]  would listen
[2041.78 --> 2043.90]  to their shepherd's voice
[2043.90 --> 2045.96]  and follow their shepherd out.
[2046.96 --> 2047.24]  You know,
[2047.26 --> 2048.44]  in the days before
[2048.44 --> 2049.68]  private farms
[2049.68 --> 2050.50]  where all the sheep,
[2050.60 --> 2050.84]  of course,
[2050.88 --> 2051.94]  were kind of automatically
[2051.94 --> 2052.68]  kept together,
[2053.10 --> 2054.06]  this is how you would
[2054.06 --> 2055.40]  keep the flocks apart
[2055.40 --> 2056.64]  and tell them
[2056.64 --> 2057.50]  one from another.
[2057.64 --> 2058.84]  The shepherd would call them,
[2059.08 --> 2060.22]  call out to his flock,
[2060.70 --> 2062.36]  and the sheep would listen
[2062.36 --> 2063.10]  and they would gather
[2063.10 --> 2063.90]  around that shepherd
[2063.90 --> 2064.76]  and then they would
[2064.76 --> 2066.18]  follow the shepherd out,
[2066.52 --> 2066.76]  you know,
[2066.76 --> 2067.52]  into pasture.
[2067.52 --> 2070.32]  So this is the setting
[2070.32 --> 2071.68]  that Jesus
[2071.68 --> 2073.10]  is talking about here.
[2073.76 --> 2074.72]  And he's saying
[2074.72 --> 2076.34]  someone is entering
[2076.34 --> 2077.22]  the sheep pen
[2077.22 --> 2078.36]  not through the door
[2078.36 --> 2079.14]  or the gate,
[2079.34 --> 2080.40]  but he's coming in
[2080.40 --> 2081.26]  by some other way
[2081.26 --> 2082.08]  in that he says
[2082.08 --> 2083.20]  that is not the shepherd,
[2083.82 --> 2084.88]  but is a thief
[2084.88 --> 2085.80]  and a robber.
[2086.44 --> 2087.66]  And he's getting
[2087.66 --> 2089.12]  into the sheep pen
[2089.12 --> 2090.14]  to steal the sheep.
[2090.26 --> 2091.66]  Sheep were very valuable.
[2092.34 --> 2092.76]  Their meat,
[2092.76 --> 2093.34]  their wool,
[2093.64 --> 2094.08]  it was their,
[2094.42 --> 2095.06]  for a shepherd
[2095.06 --> 2095.78]  or for a family,
[2095.92 --> 2096.66]  a lot of their wealth
[2096.66 --> 2097.56]  was in those sheep.
[2099.00 --> 2100.18]  And in this passage,
[2100.38 --> 2101.60]  Jesus not only talks
[2101.60 --> 2103.00]  about robbers
[2103.00 --> 2103.54]  of the sheep,
[2103.84 --> 2105.00]  but he's also talking
[2105.00 --> 2106.26]  about bad shepherds.
[2106.32 --> 2107.06]  These are shepherds
[2107.06 --> 2107.96]  who don't personally
[2107.96 --> 2108.68]  own the sheep,
[2108.74 --> 2109.22]  but they would be
[2109.22 --> 2110.08]  hired hands,
[2110.22 --> 2110.90]  who would just be
[2110.90 --> 2111.64]  doing a job.
[2111.72 --> 2112.30]  And so if there was
[2112.30 --> 2113.08]  ever any danger,
[2113.78 --> 2114.36]  they would say,
[2114.46 --> 2114.74]  you know,
[2114.86 --> 2115.74]  I'm not going to
[2115.74 --> 2117.14]  kind of risk myself
[2117.14 --> 2118.12]  for these sheep
[2118.12 --> 2119.04]  that I don't even own
[2119.04 --> 2119.92]  and they would run away.
[2120.68 --> 2121.66]  They don't care
[2121.66 --> 2123.14]  anything for the sheep.
[2125.06 --> 2125.84]  Now it's important
[2125.84 --> 2126.42]  to notice
[2126.42 --> 2127.50]  that this passage
[2127.50 --> 2128.72]  comes right after
[2128.72 --> 2130.68]  John chapter 9
[2130.68 --> 2131.36]  that we looked at
[2131.36 --> 2131.94]  last week.
[2132.44 --> 2132.90]  Remember,
[2133.24 --> 2133.98]  last week,
[2134.08 --> 2134.84]  the Pharisees
[2134.84 --> 2135.66]  were so angry
[2135.66 --> 2136.24]  with Jesus
[2136.24 --> 2137.96]  because Jesus comes
[2137.96 --> 2138.68]  and he heals
[2138.68 --> 2140.04]  a man who was born blind.
[2141.10 --> 2142.12]  And they're angry
[2142.12 --> 2142.70]  that he healed
[2142.70 --> 2143.36]  on the Sabbath.
[2143.64 --> 2144.86]  They don't believe
[2144.86 --> 2146.26]  that it was a miracle
[2146.26 --> 2146.88]  from God.
[2147.54 --> 2149.14]  And Jesus condemns
[2149.14 --> 2150.18]  these Pharisees,
[2150.28 --> 2151.10]  the spiritual leaders,
[2151.44 --> 2153.26]  for being spiritually blind.
[2153.26 --> 2155.58]  And then immediately
[2155.58 --> 2157.16]  in John chapter 10,
[2157.64 --> 2159.18]  he begins to teach
[2159.18 --> 2161.04]  about good shepherds
[2161.04 --> 2162.66]  and bad shepherds.
[2163.38 --> 2164.34]  And for the Jews,
[2164.46 --> 2164.64]  then,
[2164.70 --> 2165.36]  who are listening
[2165.36 --> 2165.92]  to Jesus,
[2166.06 --> 2167.02]  the point is clear.
[2167.82 --> 2168.92]  Jesus is arguing
[2168.92 --> 2170.36]  that Israel
[2170.36 --> 2171.50]  is filled
[2171.50 --> 2172.78]  with bad shepherds.
[2173.42 --> 2173.62]  Right?
[2173.64 --> 2174.98]  He's telling Israel
[2174.98 --> 2175.74]  that they're like
[2175.74 --> 2177.30]  this giant flock
[2177.30 --> 2177.80]  of sheep
[2177.80 --> 2178.46]  and that they are
[2178.46 --> 2179.72]  being poorly treated
[2179.72 --> 2181.36]  by those who lead them.
[2181.36 --> 2183.08]  The Pharisees
[2183.08 --> 2184.20]  and other leaders
[2184.20 --> 2185.58]  have been leading
[2185.58 --> 2186.60]  the people astray.
[2187.44 --> 2187.56]  Right?
[2187.62 --> 2188.98]  They've rejected Jesus
[2188.98 --> 2190.82]  and they are leading
[2190.82 --> 2191.94]  people down
[2191.94 --> 2192.88]  a path
[2192.88 --> 2194.66]  to their spiritual destruction.
[2196.12 --> 2198.18]  And there's a rich background
[2198.18 --> 2199.68]  in the Bible
[2199.68 --> 2200.90]  to this.
[2201.76 --> 2203.44]  So back in Ezekiel
[2203.44 --> 2204.96]  chapter 34
[2204.96 --> 2206.42]  in the Old Testament,
[2206.42 --> 2208.70]  God makes
[2208.70 --> 2210.44]  an extended critique
[2210.44 --> 2211.90]  of the priests
[2211.90 --> 2213.14]  of Israel.
[2213.98 --> 2215.18]  In Ezekiel 34,
[2215.44 --> 2216.68]  God speaks directly
[2216.68 --> 2217.54]  to the shepherds
[2217.54 --> 2218.00]  of Israel,
[2218.46 --> 2219.44]  these spiritual leaders,
[2219.86 --> 2221.44]  and this is what God says.
[2222.70 --> 2223.56]  He says,
[2223.56 --> 2224.12]  to them,
[2224.12 --> 2225.82]  you eat the curds,
[2226.32 --> 2227.20]  clothe yourselves
[2227.20 --> 2227.98]  with the wool,
[2228.48 --> 2229.24]  and slaughter
[2229.24 --> 2230.36]  the choice animals,
[2230.98 --> 2232.48]  but you do not care
[2232.48 --> 2233.36]  for the flock.
[2234.08 --> 2235.26]  You have not strengthened
[2235.26 --> 2235.84]  the weak
[2235.84 --> 2236.82]  or healed the sick
[2236.82 --> 2238.56]  or bound up the injured.
[2239.00 --> 2240.16]  You have not brought back
[2240.16 --> 2240.82]  the strays
[2240.82 --> 2242.12]  or searched for the lost.
[2242.32 --> 2243.66]  You have ruled them
[2243.66 --> 2244.52]  harshly
[2244.52 --> 2245.64]  and brutally.
[2247.28 --> 2248.44]  God says,
[2249.48 --> 2249.72]  you know,
[2249.76 --> 2251.00]  instead of feeding
[2251.00 --> 2251.66]  the sheep,
[2252.14 --> 2253.22]  you've been eating them.
[2254.20 --> 2255.24]  Instead of clothing
[2255.24 --> 2255.88]  the sheep
[2255.88 --> 2257.06]  or keeping them protected,
[2257.20 --> 2257.88]  you've been stealing
[2257.88 --> 2258.50]  their wool.
[2259.54 --> 2260.02]  God says,
[2260.22 --> 2260.92]  the weak sheep,
[2261.02 --> 2262.40]  you have not strengthened them.
[2262.72 --> 2263.58]  The sick sheep,
[2263.64 --> 2264.56]  you have not healed them.
[2264.64 --> 2265.06]  The injured,
[2265.18 --> 2266.16]  you have not bound up.
[2266.40 --> 2267.28]  The straying sheep,
[2267.38 --> 2268.64]  you have not gone after
[2268.64 --> 2271.20]  and brought them back.
[2272.26 --> 2273.12]  And God says,
[2273.26 --> 2274.44]  I am against
[2274.44 --> 2276.26]  the shepherds of Israel.
[2276.50 --> 2277.74]  I am opposed to them
[2277.74 --> 2278.82]  because they have not
[2278.82 --> 2279.70]  lived up
[2279.70 --> 2281.32]  to their calling.
[2281.32 --> 2284.14]  They are under-shepherds
[2284.14 --> 2285.26]  serving God
[2285.26 --> 2286.34]  who in the Bible
[2286.34 --> 2288.48]  is the true king shepherd.
[2289.26 --> 2290.66]  But they have not
[2290.66 --> 2291.60]  done their job.
[2292.58 --> 2293.20]  And so the language
[2293.20 --> 2294.40]  that Jesus is using here
[2294.40 --> 2295.26]  is pretty clear
[2295.26 --> 2296.64]  that he is equating
[2296.64 --> 2297.66]  the Pharisees
[2297.66 --> 2300.68]  to these bad shepherds.
[2301.98 --> 2302.74]  And friends,
[2302.82 --> 2303.74]  I also think this is
[2303.74 --> 2304.72]  a warning though
[2304.72 --> 2305.70]  as well
[2305.70 --> 2307.14]  to the modern church.
[2307.14 --> 2309.00]  And we know
[2309.00 --> 2309.62]  that there are
[2309.62 --> 2310.72]  bad shepherds
[2310.72 --> 2311.34]  in the church.
[2312.12 --> 2313.10]  Sometimes we hear
[2313.10 --> 2313.98]  in the news
[2313.98 --> 2315.60]  about sexual abuse
[2315.60 --> 2316.22]  in the church.
[2316.70 --> 2317.46]  We hear about
[2317.46 --> 2318.92]  financial scandals
[2318.92 --> 2320.58]  where spiritual leaders
[2320.58 --> 2321.70]  will use their position
[2321.70 --> 2322.40]  of authority
[2322.40 --> 2323.70]  to take advantage
[2323.70 --> 2324.40]  of the sheep.
[2325.94 --> 2327.00]  And tragically,
[2327.12 --> 2327.82]  this is the world
[2327.82 --> 2328.54]  that we live in.
[2329.00 --> 2329.84]  And God says,
[2330.06 --> 2330.76]  I am against
[2330.76 --> 2331.48]  those people
[2331.48 --> 2333.00]  and that they
[2333.00 --> 2334.62]  will be paid
[2334.62 --> 2336.18]  for their deeds.
[2336.18 --> 2338.40]  You know,
[2338.44 --> 2339.08]  as sheep,
[2339.28 --> 2339.70]  also,
[2339.82 --> 2340.76]  we are not to listen
[2340.76 --> 2341.64]  to their voice
[2341.64 --> 2342.68]  or to follow them.
[2344.04 --> 2344.48]  And now,
[2344.56 --> 2345.60]  because there is
[2345.60 --> 2346.48]  no good shepherd
[2346.48 --> 2348.12]  for his people,
[2348.48 --> 2349.82]  this is what God
[2349.82 --> 2350.72]  then says
[2350.72 --> 2351.84]  in Ezekiel 34.
[2353.14 --> 2354.10]  God says,
[2354.36 --> 2355.18]  I myself
[2355.18 --> 2355.88]  will search
[2355.88 --> 2356.78]  for my sheep
[2356.78 --> 2357.88]  and look after them.
[2358.44 --> 2359.36]  I myself
[2359.36 --> 2360.74]  will tend my sheep
[2360.74 --> 2362.04]  and have them
[2362.04 --> 2362.66]  lie down.
[2363.36 --> 2364.28]  I will search
[2364.28 --> 2364.96]  for the lost
[2364.96 --> 2365.92]  and bring them back.
[2366.18 --> 2367.12]  I will bind up
[2367.12 --> 2367.62]  the injured
[2367.62 --> 2368.30]  and strengthen
[2368.30 --> 2368.90]  the weak.
[2369.34 --> 2370.14]  I will shepherd
[2370.14 --> 2371.10]  the flock
[2371.10 --> 2372.36]  with justice.
[2373.68 --> 2374.02]  And so,
[2374.30 --> 2375.56]  this is amazing
[2375.56 --> 2376.64]  because the promise
[2376.64 --> 2377.76]  of Ezekiel 34
[2377.76 --> 2378.86]  is not that
[2378.86 --> 2381.02]  these human shepherds
[2381.02 --> 2382.32]  are going to kind of
[2382.32 --> 2383.26]  get their act together.
[2383.44 --> 2384.06]  They're going to be
[2384.06 --> 2385.64]  pretty good shepherds.
[2385.70 --> 2385.98]  They're going to be
[2385.98 --> 2387.20]  a little bit better shepherds.
[2387.70 --> 2388.76]  That's not the promise.
[2389.64 --> 2390.18]  God says,
[2390.46 --> 2390.78]  one day,
[2390.86 --> 2392.12]  I'm going to be
[2392.12 --> 2392.62]  your shepherd.
[2393.22 --> 2393.66]  One day,
[2393.66 --> 2394.78]  I'm going to come
[2394.78 --> 2395.48]  and I'm going to
[2395.48 --> 2396.32]  rescue my people.
[2396.68 --> 2397.72]  I'm going to feed them.
[2397.84 --> 2398.80]  I'm going to protect them.
[2399.92 --> 2400.14]  And so,
[2400.22 --> 2400.42]  friends,
[2400.50 --> 2401.80]  that is the background.
[2401.94 --> 2402.98]  That's the whole story
[2402.98 --> 2403.56]  of Israel
[2403.56 --> 2404.76]  and they would have been
[2404.76 --> 2405.84]  so familiar
[2405.84 --> 2406.64]  with this imagery
[2406.64 --> 2407.30]  of God
[2407.30 --> 2408.00]  as a shepherd,
[2408.78 --> 2411.16]  of the problems
[2411.16 --> 2412.18]  of the past
[2412.18 --> 2413.36]  with the spiritual leaders
[2413.36 --> 2414.12]  who have failed
[2414.12 --> 2415.10]  this calling.
[2416.56 --> 2416.86]  And so,
[2416.86 --> 2417.80]  now in our passes,
[2417.80 --> 2419.02]  Jesus comes
[2419.02 --> 2420.44]  and he says,
[2421.12 --> 2422.20]  I am
[2422.20 --> 2423.42]  the good shepherd.
[2424.64 --> 2425.48]  And friends,
[2425.58 --> 2426.26]  this is amazing.
[2427.40 --> 2427.58]  You know,
[2427.72 --> 2428.98]  you and I,
[2429.08 --> 2429.76]  we hear this,
[2429.82 --> 2430.68]  we read this today
[2430.68 --> 2431.38]  and we're like,
[2431.96 --> 2432.84]  I'm the good shepherd.
[2432.98 --> 2433.10]  Well,
[2433.12 --> 2433.94]  that's kind of cute.
[2434.44 --> 2434.62]  Right?
[2434.68 --> 2435.66]  That's kind of a cute metaphor.
[2436.06 --> 2436.74]  We like sheep.
[2436.86 --> 2437.52]  They're kind of fun.
[2438.44 --> 2439.56]  But to the Jews,
[2439.70 --> 2441.38]  this was a shocking statement
[2441.38 --> 2443.24]  because Jesus is saying,
[2443.24 --> 2444.34]  I am the God
[2444.34 --> 2444.90]  who has come
[2444.90 --> 2445.96]  to shepherd my people.
[2446.32 --> 2447.78]  I'm Ezekiel 34
[2447.78 --> 2448.60]  in the flesh.
[2449.30 --> 2450.32]  It was actually
[2450.32 --> 2451.50]  a direct claim
[2451.50 --> 2452.30]  to divinity.
[2452.78 --> 2452.98]  And so,
[2453.06 --> 2454.08]  at the end of this passage,
[2454.16 --> 2454.86]  we didn't read it,
[2455.12 --> 2456.12]  but as some people say,
[2456.22 --> 2457.32]  this guy is raving mad.
[2457.64 --> 2458.44]  Other people say
[2458.44 --> 2459.18]  he has a demon
[2459.18 --> 2461.22]  because he is making
[2461.22 --> 2463.54]  such an outrageous claim.
[2463.70 --> 2464.30]  He's saying,
[2464.56 --> 2465.58]  I am this God.
[2466.64 --> 2467.52]  Jesus is saying,
[2467.64 --> 2468.74]  I am the fulfillment
[2468.74 --> 2470.36]  of what Israel
[2470.36 --> 2472.80]  has been longing for.
[2472.80 --> 2477.14]  another really important passage
[2477.14 --> 2478.88]  is in Isaiah 40.
[2480.02 --> 2481.48]  And it talks about,
[2481.76 --> 2481.98]  again,
[2482.08 --> 2482.92]  this Messiah
[2482.92 --> 2483.86]  who would come,
[2484.52 --> 2485.46]  who would shepherd
[2485.46 --> 2486.62]  God's flock
[2486.62 --> 2488.26]  and care for his sheep.
[2488.82 --> 2489.72]  It says,
[2490.28 --> 2490.54]  see,
[2490.70 --> 2491.60]  the sovereign Lord
[2491.60 --> 2492.70]  comes with power
[2492.70 --> 2494.32]  and he rules
[2494.32 --> 2495.28]  with a mighty arm.
[2496.00 --> 2497.46]  He tends his flock
[2497.46 --> 2498.08]  like a shepherd.
[2498.76 --> 2500.20]  He gathers the lambs
[2500.20 --> 2500.88]  in his arms
[2500.88 --> 2501.66]  and he carries them
[2501.66 --> 2502.56]  close to his heart.
[2503.32 --> 2504.50]  He gently leads
[2504.50 --> 2505.44]  those who have young.
[2506.86 --> 2507.24]  And friends,
[2507.32 --> 2508.68]  this is what we have
[2508.68 --> 2509.68]  in Jesus
[2509.68 --> 2511.06]  who is the God-man.
[2511.76 --> 2512.00]  Right?
[2512.06 --> 2513.18]  He is the one
[2513.18 --> 2514.84]  who is God enough
[2514.84 --> 2515.80]  where,
[2516.04 --> 2516.90]  as Isaiah says,
[2516.98 --> 2517.90]  he can save us
[2517.90 --> 2518.88]  with a mighty arm.
[2519.10 --> 2520.60]  He can rule over us
[2520.60 --> 2521.62]  as a good king.
[2522.48 --> 2523.14]  And yet,
[2523.24 --> 2524.40]  he is human enough
[2524.40 --> 2527.02]  that he can relate to us
[2527.02 --> 2528.98]  and that he can die
[2528.98 --> 2530.06]  in our place.
[2531.50 --> 2532.46]  That's what it means
[2532.46 --> 2533.30]  that Jesus is
[2533.30 --> 2533.88]  the good shepherd.
[2535.38 --> 2535.94]  And so,
[2536.08 --> 2536.78]  that leads us then
[2536.78 --> 2537.96]  to our second point
[2537.96 --> 2538.48]  this morning
[2538.48 --> 2539.24]  because Jesus
[2539.24 --> 2540.24]  not only tells us
[2540.24 --> 2541.06]  that he's the good shepherd,
[2541.62 --> 2542.82]  he also tells us
[2542.82 --> 2544.10]  what is this shepherd like?
[2545.34 --> 2546.76]  And there are three things,
[2546.82 --> 2547.84]  actually there are four things,
[2547.94 --> 2549.82]  that Jesus came to reveal
[2549.82 --> 2551.82]  about what he is like
[2551.82 --> 2552.94]  as the good shepherd.
[2553.46 --> 2553.70]  And so,
[2553.80 --> 2555.00]  he kind of gives us
[2555.00 --> 2555.66]  this image
[2555.66 --> 2556.68]  and he tells us,
[2556.70 --> 2557.82]  he tells us this huge metaphor
[2557.82 --> 2559.24]  of all these things
[2559.24 --> 2560.16]  that we can know about it.
[2561.28 --> 2561.68]  So,
[2561.76 --> 2562.90]  the first one is,
[2563.46 --> 2564.64]  he knows the sheep.
[2566.06 --> 2567.36]  In verse 14,
[2567.48 --> 2568.06]  it says,
[2568.62 --> 2569.74]  I am the good shepherd,
[2570.28 --> 2572.06]  I know my sheep.
[2572.98 --> 2574.26]  And then in verse 3,
[2574.62 --> 2575.34]  it says,
[2576.00 --> 2577.86]  he calls his own sheep
[2577.86 --> 2578.60]  by name.
[2579.64 --> 2580.40]  Now again,
[2580.74 --> 2581.78]  I don't know anything
[2581.78 --> 2582.78]  about sheep firsthand.
[2583.82 --> 2584.14]  I mean,
[2584.18 --> 2585.02]  I've pet one before,
[2585.14 --> 2586.28]  but I don't really know them.
[2586.28 --> 2588.00]  But the reference books
[2588.00 --> 2588.78]  tell us this,
[2589.36 --> 2590.36]  that it is true
[2590.36 --> 2592.14]  that sheep quickly learn
[2592.14 --> 2593.76]  and know the voice
[2593.76 --> 2594.36]  of their shepherd.
[2595.04 --> 2595.34]  So,
[2595.46 --> 2596.32]  when the shepherd comes
[2596.32 --> 2597.20]  to the gate
[2597.20 --> 2598.94]  and he calls to his sheep,
[2599.68 --> 2600.96]  the sheep will come out
[2600.96 --> 2601.86]  and follow the shepherd.
[2603.04 --> 2603.38]  But,
[2603.46 --> 2604.20]  one thing that
[2604.20 --> 2606.06]  is not at all typical,
[2606.24 --> 2607.28]  where Jesus is kind of
[2607.28 --> 2608.36]  breaking the metaphor,
[2609.46 --> 2610.56]  is that ancient
[2610.56 --> 2611.28]  Near East shepherds
[2611.88 --> 2613.62]  would not
[2613.62 --> 2614.92]  have a name
[2614.92 --> 2615.58]  for each one
[2615.58 --> 2616.12]  of their sheep.
[2616.20 --> 2617.04]  That was unheard of.
[2617.14 --> 2618.10]  They wouldn't have a name
[2618.10 --> 2618.74]  for each sheep.
[2619.40 --> 2619.54]  Right?
[2619.60 --> 2620.22]  They wouldn't come up
[2620.22 --> 2621.02]  to a sheep pen
[2621.02 --> 2622.46]  and say,
[2623.48 --> 2624.00]  Dasher,
[2624.50 --> 2625.06]  Dancer,
[2625.96 --> 2626.16]  you know,
[2626.56 --> 2627.48]  Prancer and Vixen.
[2627.56 --> 2627.74]  You know,
[2627.80 --> 2628.58]  they wouldn't do that.
[2629.52 --> 2630.64]  They wouldn't call them out
[2630.64 --> 2631.64]  one at a time.
[2631.84 --> 2632.54]  They would just
[2632.54 --> 2633.88]  use their voice
[2633.88 --> 2634.48]  and all the sheep
[2634.48 --> 2635.02]  would listen.
[2635.70 --> 2636.24]  But yet,
[2636.46 --> 2637.44]  the Greek text
[2637.44 --> 2638.64]  definitely says
[2638.64 --> 2639.44]  that he calls
[2639.44 --> 2641.14]  each one
[2641.14 --> 2642.08]  of the sheep
[2642.08 --> 2643.02]  by name.
[2643.02 --> 2646.02]  What this is telling us
[2646.02 --> 2646.86]  is that Jesus
[2646.86 --> 2648.06]  as a shepherd
[2648.06 --> 2650.04]  gives us a name.
[2650.60 --> 2650.80]  Now,
[2650.82 --> 2651.68]  this is so important.
[2653.00 --> 2653.16]  You know,
[2653.22 --> 2653.88]  in the Bible,
[2654.66 --> 2655.84]  a name is much
[2655.84 --> 2656.84]  more than a label.
[2657.08 --> 2657.28]  I mean,
[2657.32 --> 2657.96]  that's kind of the way
[2657.96 --> 2659.06]  we use names
[2659.06 --> 2660.26]  just so we can call someone,
[2660.98 --> 2661.16]  say,
[2661.24 --> 2661.38]  hey,
[2661.46 --> 2661.92]  there's Andrew.
[2663.12 --> 2664.14]  But first of all,
[2664.20 --> 2664.84]  in the Bible,
[2665.32 --> 2666.86]  a name means
[2666.86 --> 2667.54]  significance
[2667.54 --> 2668.26]  and status.
[2668.26 --> 2669.52]  So remember,
[2669.68 --> 2670.94]  in Genesis chapter 11,
[2671.38 --> 2672.24]  why were they building
[2672.24 --> 2673.24]  the Tower of Babel?
[2673.84 --> 2674.56]  They said,
[2675.00 --> 2676.08]  let us make a name
[2676.08 --> 2676.96]  for ourselves.
[2677.68 --> 2677.80]  Right?
[2677.86 --> 2678.60]  To have a name
[2678.60 --> 2679.78]  means significance.
[2681.44 --> 2682.18]  Another thing
[2682.18 --> 2682.88]  we see in the Bible
[2682.88 --> 2684.14]  is that a name
[2684.14 --> 2684.80]  also meant
[2684.80 --> 2685.44]  a purpose
[2685.44 --> 2686.02]  or a mission.
[2686.92 --> 2688.68]  When Abram's mission
[2688.68 --> 2690.00]  in life changed,
[2690.58 --> 2691.28]  God gave him
[2691.28 --> 2692.16]  the name Abraham
[2692.16 --> 2693.02]  because he was going
[2693.02 --> 2693.70]  to be the father
[2693.70 --> 2694.26]  of a multitude.
[2695.26 --> 2696.52]  When Simon's mission
[2696.52 --> 2697.46]  in life changed,
[2697.46 --> 2699.02]  Jesus gave him
[2699.02 --> 2699.82]  the name Peter
[2699.82 --> 2700.88]  because he was going
[2700.88 --> 2701.66]  to be the rock.
[2703.70 --> 2703.90]  So,
[2704.04 --> 2704.82]  name also means
[2704.82 --> 2705.66]  mission or purpose.
[2705.90 --> 2706.52]  And then thirdly,
[2706.56 --> 2707.02]  in the Bible,
[2707.14 --> 2708.22]  your name also means
[2708.22 --> 2708.92]  your character
[2708.92 --> 2710.80]  or your distinctiveness.
[2711.22 --> 2711.34]  You know,
[2711.42 --> 2712.16]  Jesus called
[2712.16 --> 2713.14]  some of his disciples
[2713.14 --> 2715.00]  and he gave
[2715.00 --> 2715.88]  some of them
[2715.88 --> 2716.90]  the name,
[2716.94 --> 2718.00]  you know,
[2718.12 --> 2718.88]  Sons of Thunder.
[2719.02 --> 2719.56]  That was kind of
[2719.56 --> 2720.34]  their personality.
[2721.32 --> 2721.98]  That was his nickname
[2721.98 --> 2722.56]  for them.
[2724.30 --> 2724.48]  You know,
[2724.54 --> 2725.06]  so it's,
[2725.20 --> 2726.24]  the name is the person
[2726.24 --> 2727.00]  that God has made
[2727.00 --> 2727.60]  you to be.
[2728.46 --> 2729.36]  And so there's this verse
[2729.36 --> 2730.88]  in Revelation chapter 2
[2730.88 --> 2731.58]  verse 17
[2731.58 --> 2733.14]  where Jesus says,
[2733.86 --> 2734.82]  I will also give
[2734.82 --> 2735.50]  that person
[2735.50 --> 2736.66]  a white stone
[2736.66 --> 2737.62]  with a new name
[2737.62 --> 2738.42]  written on it,
[2739.02 --> 2740.38]  known only to the one
[2740.38 --> 2741.22]  who receives it.
[2742.32 --> 2743.48]  So the Bible says
[2743.48 --> 2744.18]  that when you become
[2744.18 --> 2744.88]  a Christian,
[2745.74 --> 2747.32]  what Jesus does
[2747.32 --> 2748.94]  is he names you.
[2749.52 --> 2750.38]  He gives you
[2750.38 --> 2751.66]  significance,
[2752.26 --> 2753.70]  he gives you purpose,
[2753.70 --> 2755.70]  and he gives you
[2755.70 --> 2757.08]  a character
[2757.08 --> 2758.10]  and a distinctiveness.
[2758.66 --> 2759.56]  He gives you deeds
[2759.56 --> 2760.68]  that he has called
[2760.68 --> 2761.22]  you to do.
[2761.32 --> 2762.10]  He gives you people
[2762.10 --> 2762.66]  in your life
[2762.66 --> 2763.72]  that he has called you
[2763.72 --> 2764.90]  to minister to,
[2765.00 --> 2765.76]  uniquely you.
[2768.22 --> 2769.06]  And what that means
[2769.06 --> 2769.94]  is that it is
[2769.94 --> 2771.14]  from Jesus
[2771.14 --> 2772.66]  that we finally
[2772.66 --> 2774.34]  get what it is
[2774.34 --> 2775.10]  that we are all
[2775.10 --> 2775.70]  looking for.
[2776.44 --> 2777.60]  And if you don't
[2777.60 --> 2778.32]  look to him
[2778.32 --> 2779.08]  to name you,
[2779.22 --> 2779.90]  what happens
[2779.90 --> 2780.76]  is that you're going
[2780.76 --> 2781.70]  to look to something else.
[2782.34 --> 2783.12]  That's why
[2783.12 --> 2784.16]  we listen to
[2784.16 --> 2784.96]  all these other voices
[2784.96 --> 2785.84]  because we're listening
[2785.84 --> 2787.58]  to a voice
[2787.58 --> 2788.60]  that will give us
[2788.60 --> 2789.00]  a name,
[2789.54 --> 2790.48]  that will finally
[2790.48 --> 2791.88]  give us a sense
[2791.88 --> 2792.50]  of belonging
[2792.50 --> 2793.72]  or significance
[2793.72 --> 2794.58]  or identity
[2794.58 --> 2795.52]  or purpose.
[2796.68 --> 2797.64]  But if you look
[2797.64 --> 2798.32]  to anything
[2798.32 --> 2799.78]  to do this
[2799.78 --> 2801.06]  ultimate naming
[2801.06 --> 2801.62]  and leading
[2801.62 --> 2802.34]  in your life,
[2802.42 --> 2803.12]  you will find
[2803.12 --> 2804.06]  that some of them
[2804.06 --> 2804.82]  are like a thief.
[2805.18 --> 2805.60]  Some of them
[2805.60 --> 2806.14]  will actually
[2806.14 --> 2806.94]  just use you.
[2807.86 --> 2808.46]  You will find
[2808.46 --> 2809.02]  that some of them
[2809.02 --> 2810.48]  are like a hired hand
[2810.48 --> 2811.20]  and they're just
[2811.20 --> 2811.96]  going to run away
[2811.96 --> 2812.64]  when you need
[2812.64 --> 2813.26]  the most.
[2814.96 --> 2816.28]  But you have
[2816.28 --> 2817.16]  a good shepherd
[2817.16 --> 2818.54]  and when you
[2818.54 --> 2819.50]  come to him
[2819.50 --> 2820.96]  and you follow him,
[2821.50 --> 2822.42]  you will find
[2822.42 --> 2824.42]  that your particular
[2824.42 --> 2825.58]  name will become
[2825.58 --> 2826.64]  revealed to you
[2826.64 --> 2827.30]  over time.
[2827.58 --> 2828.38]  As you follow
[2828.38 --> 2828.92]  this shepherd
[2828.92 --> 2829.44]  and you get
[2829.44 --> 2830.16]  to know him,
[2830.42 --> 2831.64]  as you are known
[2831.64 --> 2832.46]  and you know,
[2833.84 --> 2834.96]  you discover
[2834.96 --> 2835.88]  who God
[2835.88 --> 2836.82]  is turning you
[2836.82 --> 2837.26]  into
[2837.26 --> 2838.18]  and making you
[2838.18 --> 2838.44]  into.
[2838.44 --> 2840.22]  So that's
[2840.22 --> 2840.80]  the first thing
[2840.80 --> 2841.22]  we learn
[2841.22 --> 2842.52]  about the good
[2842.52 --> 2842.84]  shepherd,
[2842.96 --> 2843.70]  that he knows
[2843.70 --> 2844.36]  his sheep.
[2845.38 --> 2846.26]  And the second
[2846.26 --> 2846.96]  thing is
[2846.96 --> 2848.18]  he leads
[2848.18 --> 2848.70]  the sheep.
[2850.62 --> 2851.36]  It's very
[2851.36 --> 2851.94]  important to
[2851.94 --> 2852.46]  realize
[2852.46 --> 2853.52]  that there is
[2853.52 --> 2854.04]  actually a
[2854.04 --> 2854.46]  difference
[2854.46 --> 2855.44]  between western
[2855.44 --> 2856.02]  shepherds
[2856.02 --> 2856.68]  that we might
[2856.68 --> 2857.38]  kind of have
[2857.38 --> 2857.92]  in our mind
[2857.92 --> 2858.42]  wandering
[2858.42 --> 2861.16]  in the
[2861.16 --> 2861.94]  pastures
[2861.94 --> 2863.88]  and eastern
[2863.88 --> 2864.60]  shepherds.
[2865.78 --> 2866.16]  Western
[2866.16 --> 2866.88]  shepherds
[2866.88 --> 2867.82]  drive the
[2867.82 --> 2868.10]  sheep.
[2868.30 --> 2868.68]  So they
[2868.68 --> 2869.08]  might use
[2869.08 --> 2869.40]  a sheep
[2869.40 --> 2869.82]  dog
[2869.82 --> 2870.62]  or they
[2870.62 --> 2870.84]  might
[2870.84 --> 2871.10]  actually
[2871.10 --> 2871.38]  kind of
[2871.38 --> 2871.74]  prod
[2871.74 --> 2872.52]  and poke
[2872.52 --> 2873.02]  the sheep
[2873.02 --> 2873.60]  and get
[2873.60 --> 2874.06]  them moving.
[2875.20 --> 2875.96]  But eastern
[2875.96 --> 2876.76]  shepherds
[2876.76 --> 2877.38]  are a little
[2877.38 --> 2877.86]  bit different.
[2878.08 --> 2878.70]  They led
[2878.70 --> 2879.16]  the sheep.
[2879.82 --> 2880.26]  That's why
[2880.26 --> 2880.94]  Jesus said
[2880.94 --> 2881.52]  he calls
[2881.52 --> 2881.88]  his own
[2881.88 --> 2882.26]  sheep by
[2882.26 --> 2882.66]  name
[2882.66 --> 2883.42]  and he
[2883.42 --> 2884.10]  leads them
[2884.10 --> 2884.34]  out.
[2884.42 --> 2884.78]  He goes
[2884.78 --> 2885.20]  in front
[2885.20 --> 2886.12]  of them.
[2887.50 --> 2887.80]  And what
[2887.80 --> 2888.52]  this is saying
[2888.52 --> 2889.20]  is that when
[2889.20 --> 2889.68]  you believe
[2889.68 --> 2890.08]  in Jesus
[2890.08 --> 2890.62]  Christ,
[2891.26 --> 2891.82]  he's right
[2891.82 --> 2892.66]  there with
[2892.66 --> 2893.26]  you leading
[2893.26 --> 2893.72]  and guiding
[2893.72 --> 2894.12]  you through
[2894.12 --> 2894.50]  life.
[2894.82 --> 2894.94]  You know,
[2894.98 --> 2895.32]  he doesn't
[2895.32 --> 2895.82]  call you
[2895.82 --> 2896.30]  to follow
[2896.30 --> 2896.94]  him and
[2896.94 --> 2897.22]  then kind
[2897.22 --> 2897.54]  of sit
[2897.54 --> 2898.60]  back and
[2898.60 --> 2898.92]  give you
[2898.92 --> 2899.44]  the map
[2899.44 --> 2900.08]  and say,
[2900.28 --> 2900.54]  you know,
[2900.68 --> 2901.12]  there he
[2901.12 --> 2901.36]  goes,
[2901.44 --> 2901.64]  took a
[2901.64 --> 2902.02]  wrong turn
[2902.02 --> 2902.70]  again and
[2902.70 --> 2903.34]  kind of
[2903.34 --> 2903.92]  get you
[2903.92 --> 2904.22]  going to
[2904.22 --> 2904.38]  the right
[2904.38 --> 2904.70]  place.
[2904.76 --> 2905.26]  He actually
[2905.26 --> 2905.62]  is there
[2905.62 --> 2906.00]  with you.
[2906.06 --> 2906.58]  He's guiding
[2906.58 --> 2906.98]  you and
[2906.98 --> 2907.88]  he's leading
[2907.88 --> 2908.20]  you.
[2909.66 --> 2910.14]  Romans
[2910.14 --> 2910.90]  chapter 8
[2910.90 --> 2911.56]  verse 14
[2911.56 --> 2912.04]  says,
[2912.22 --> 2912.66]  for those
[2912.66 --> 2912.94]  who are
[2912.94 --> 2913.58]  led by
[2913.58 --> 2914.08]  the spirit
[2914.08 --> 2914.48]  of God
[2914.48 --> 2914.96]  are the
[2914.96 --> 2915.20]  children
[2915.20 --> 2915.70]  of God.
[2916.80 --> 2917.10]  Right?
[2917.14 --> 2917.44]  It doesn't
[2917.44 --> 2918.62]  say some
[2918.62 --> 2919.02]  of us are
[2919.02 --> 2919.30]  led.
[2919.94 --> 2920.80]  It says if
[2920.80 --> 2921.48]  you are a
[2921.48 --> 2921.98]  child of
[2921.98 --> 2922.32]  God,
[2923.02 --> 2923.70]  you are
[2923.70 --> 2924.52]  being led.
[2925.32 --> 2926.38]  What this
[2926.38 --> 2926.92]  means is that
[2926.92 --> 2927.32]  no matter
[2927.32 --> 2928.36]  what situation
[2928.36 --> 2929.20]  you face,
[2929.82 --> 2930.50]  he is right
[2930.50 --> 2931.12]  with you.
[2931.58 --> 2932.32]  He is going
[2932.32 --> 2933.32]  ahead of you
[2933.32 --> 2933.82]  in any
[2933.82 --> 2934.46]  situation.
[2936.50 --> 2936.72]  You know,
[2936.82 --> 2938.66]  when Psalm 23
[2938.66 --> 2939.64]  talks about
[2939.64 --> 2941.22]  God as
[2941.22 --> 2941.88]  our shepherd,
[2942.04 --> 2942.50]  which of course
[2942.50 --> 2942.98]  is fulfilled
[2942.98 --> 2943.62]  by Jesus,
[2944.00 --> 2944.44]  that's what we
[2944.44 --> 2944.90]  see here,
[2945.86 --> 2946.64]  it says,
[2947.06 --> 2947.44]  what does it
[2947.44 --> 2947.66]  say?
[2948.08 --> 2948.34]  It says,
[2948.42 --> 2949.24]  he leads us,
[2949.66 --> 2950.30]  he leads me
[2950.30 --> 2950.94]  beside quiet
[2950.94 --> 2951.26]  waters,
[2951.26 --> 2952.70]  he guides
[2952.70 --> 2953.28]  me along
[2953.28 --> 2953.58]  the right
[2953.58 --> 2954.08]  paths,
[2954.74 --> 2955.16]  and even
[2955.16 --> 2955.48]  though I
[2955.48 --> 2955.92]  walk through
[2955.92 --> 2956.36]  the darkest
[2956.36 --> 2956.76]  valley,
[2956.82 --> 2957.30]  I will fear
[2957.30 --> 2957.88]  no evil,
[2958.02 --> 2958.38]  for you
[2958.38 --> 2959.58]  are with
[2959.58 --> 2959.80]  me.
[2960.48 --> 2960.80]  You are
[2960.80 --> 2961.32]  with me.
[2962.84 --> 2963.04]  Okay,
[2963.08 --> 2963.48]  so Jesus
[2963.48 --> 2963.80]  has the
[2963.80 --> 2964.26]  good shepherd,
[2964.70 --> 2965.26]  knows his
[2965.26 --> 2965.56]  sheep,
[2965.66 --> 2965.90]  and he
[2965.90 --> 2966.44]  leads his
[2966.44 --> 2966.72]  sheep.
[2967.38 --> 2967.78]  Third,
[2968.04 --> 2968.40]  the good
[2968.40 --> 2969.60]  shepherd gives
[2969.60 --> 2970.42]  life to his
[2970.42 --> 2970.66]  sheep.
[2972.02 --> 2972.52]  Verse 10
[2972.52 --> 2972.96]  says,
[2973.08 --> 2973.42]  the thief
[2973.42 --> 2973.96]  comes only
[2973.96 --> 2974.54]  to steal
[2974.54 --> 2974.94]  and kill
[2974.94 --> 2975.52]  and destroy,
[2976.10 --> 2976.30]  so that's
[2976.30 --> 2976.78]  the contrast
[2976.78 --> 2977.12]  of those
[2977.12 --> 2977.78]  bad guys.
[2977.78 --> 2979.36]  I have
[2979.36 --> 2980.36]  come that
[2980.36 --> 2980.68]  they may
[2980.68 --> 2981.36]  have life
[2981.36 --> 2982.22]  and have
[2982.22 --> 2982.88]  it abundantly.
[2984.32 --> 2984.42]  Right,
[2984.48 --> 2984.70]  so in
[2984.70 --> 2985.18]  contrast to
[2985.18 --> 2985.56]  the bad
[2985.56 --> 2985.96]  shepherds
[2985.96 --> 2986.52]  who take
[2986.52 --> 2987.00]  life and
[2987.00 --> 2987.48]  who harm
[2987.48 --> 2988.02]  the sheep,
[2988.46 --> 2989.12]  the good
[2989.12 --> 2990.26]  shepherd gives
[2990.26 --> 2990.60]  life,
[2990.70 --> 2991.06]  he gives
[2991.06 --> 2991.62]  abundant
[2991.62 --> 2992.16]  life to
[2992.16 --> 2992.68]  the sheep,
[2993.00 --> 2993.42]  and that
[2993.42 --> 2994.16]  word life
[2994.16 --> 2995.04]  there is
[2995.04 --> 2995.52]  the Greek
[2995.52 --> 2996.14]  word zoe.
[2996.46 --> 2997.20]  It means
[2997.20 --> 2997.80]  not just
[2997.80 --> 2998.56]  existence,
[2999.56 --> 3000.50]  but it
[3000.50 --> 3001.88]  means meaning,
[3002.30 --> 3003.14]  it has a
[3003.14 --> 3003.58]  sense of
[3003.58 --> 3004.80]  purpose and
[3004.80 --> 3005.66]  wholeness and
[3005.66 --> 3006.24]  flourishing.
[3007.10 --> 3007.32]  And so
[3007.32 --> 3007.64]  friends,
[3007.78 --> 3008.56]  Jesus brings
[3008.56 --> 3009.54]  life in
[3009.54 --> 3010.98]  every sense
[3010.98 --> 3012.02]  to the
[3012.02 --> 3012.52]  people he
[3012.52 --> 3012.96]  leads.
[3013.12 --> 3013.50]  We're all
[3013.50 --> 3014.02]  looking for
[3014.02 --> 3015.16]  life in
[3015.16 --> 3016.08]  all areas
[3016.08 --> 3017.12]  of our
[3017.12 --> 3018.20]  life,
[3018.24 --> 3018.58]  and he
[3018.58 --> 3019.08]  brings it
[3019.08 --> 3019.36]  in all
[3019.36 --> 3019.92]  those places.
[3021.32 --> 3021.98]  I think
[3021.98 --> 3022.50]  this means
[3022.50 --> 3023.40]  that sometimes
[3023.40 --> 3024.52]  in the
[3024.52 --> 3025.24]  difficulty of
[3025.24 --> 3025.66]  the Christian
[3025.66 --> 3026.16]  life,
[3026.46 --> 3027.58]  there's also
[3027.58 --> 3028.34]  this incredible
[3028.34 --> 3029.66]  richness as
[3029.66 --> 3029.96]  well.
[3030.70 --> 3030.94]  Right,
[3030.98 --> 3031.66]  there's life
[3031.66 --> 3032.10]  in following
[3032.10 --> 3032.68]  Jesus as
[3032.68 --> 3033.08]  your shepherd,
[3033.20 --> 3033.32]  right?
[3033.40 --> 3033.70]  There is
[3033.70 --> 3034.10]  joy,
[3035.12 --> 3035.70]  there is
[3035.70 --> 3037.70]  grace,
[3037.78 --> 3038.24]  there is
[3038.24 --> 3038.68]  love,
[3038.78 --> 3039.08]  there is
[3039.08 --> 3040.00]  meaning given
[3040.00 --> 3040.62]  to us by
[3040.62 --> 3041.02]  Jesus.
[3041.92 --> 3042.34]  And it's
[3042.34 --> 3043.02]  through trusting
[3043.02 --> 3043.68]  Jesus and
[3043.68 --> 3044.36]  following him
[3044.36 --> 3044.70]  that we
[3044.70 --> 3045.74]  actually find
[3045.74 --> 3046.82]  our entrance
[3046.82 --> 3047.42]  into true
[3047.42 --> 3047.80]  life.
[3049.30 --> 3049.74]  And then
[3049.74 --> 3050.18]  last,
[3050.22 --> 3050.52]  the last
[3050.52 --> 3050.80]  kind of
[3050.80 --> 3051.46]  point about
[3051.46 --> 3052.28]  what does
[3052.28 --> 3052.70]  this mean
[3052.70 --> 3053.18]  that Jesus
[3053.18 --> 3054.06]  is our
[3054.06 --> 3054.74]  shepherd and
[3054.74 --> 3055.26]  what does
[3055.26 --> 3055.58]  he give
[3055.58 --> 3055.88]  us?
[3056.36 --> 3056.70]  Or what,
[3056.76 --> 3057.00]  you know,
[3057.12 --> 3058.12]  what does it
[3058.12 --> 3058.34]  mean?
[3058.60 --> 3058.88]  What does it
[3058.88 --> 3059.24]  look like?
[3059.84 --> 3060.30]  Fourth,
[3061.40 --> 3061.84]  in verse
[3061.84 --> 3062.22]  11,
[3062.22 --> 3063.04]  Jesus says,
[3063.24 --> 3063.88]  I am the
[3063.88 --> 3064.46]  good shepherd,
[3065.12 --> 3065.54]  the good
[3065.54 --> 3066.98]  shepherd lays
[3066.98 --> 3067.42]  down his
[3067.42 --> 3067.84]  life for
[3067.84 --> 3068.22]  the sheep.
[3069.94 --> 3070.56]  So the
[3070.56 --> 3071.26]  hired hand
[3071.26 --> 3072.26]  who was in
[3072.26 --> 3072.62]  it for the
[3072.62 --> 3072.92]  money,
[3073.62 --> 3074.06]  they run
[3074.06 --> 3074.34]  away.
[3074.58 --> 3075.28]  They abandon
[3075.28 --> 3075.96]  the sheep
[3075.96 --> 3076.62]  when there's
[3076.62 --> 3076.98]  danger.
[3077.86 --> 3078.50]  But Jesus,
[3078.90 --> 3079.36]  when there's
[3079.36 --> 3079.86]  danger,
[3080.24 --> 3081.24]  he dies for
[3081.24 --> 3081.66]  the sheep.
[3082.38 --> 3083.04]  When it
[3083.04 --> 3083.30]  says,
[3083.44 --> 3083.88]  I lay down
[3083.88 --> 3084.36]  my life for
[3084.36 --> 3084.72]  the sheep,
[3084.82 --> 3085.60]  he's using
[3085.60 --> 3086.14]  a Greek
[3086.14 --> 3086.84]  preposition
[3086.84 --> 3087.50]  for,
[3087.68 --> 3088.22]  for the
[3088.22 --> 3088.56]  sheep,
[3088.90 --> 3090.40]  that means
[3090.40 --> 3091.08]  in the
[3091.08 --> 3092.08]  place of.
[3093.18 --> 3093.42]  And so
[3093.42 --> 3093.98]  Jesus is
[3093.98 --> 3094.22]  saying,
[3094.42 --> 3095.08]  I am the
[3095.08 --> 3096.56]  shepherd who
[3096.56 --> 3098.60]  becomes a
[3098.60 --> 3099.52]  sacrificial lamb.
[3100.30 --> 3100.84]  I am the
[3100.84 --> 3101.36]  shepherd that
[3101.36 --> 3101.76]  when the
[3101.76 --> 3102.32]  wolf comes,
[3102.42 --> 3102.92]  I would give
[3102.92 --> 3103.78]  up everything
[3103.78 --> 3105.40]  rather than
[3105.40 --> 3106.16]  see my
[3106.16 --> 3106.92]  sheep hurt
[3106.92 --> 3107.70]  or die.
[3108.82 --> 3109.28]  And in the
[3109.28 --> 3109.66]  case of
[3109.66 --> 3110.00]  Jesus,
[3110.56 --> 3111.02]  no one is
[3111.02 --> 3111.58]  forcing him
[3111.58 --> 3112.10]  to do it,
[3112.16 --> 3112.44]  but he
[3112.44 --> 3113.28]  willingly lays
[3113.28 --> 3113.66]  down his
[3113.66 --> 3114.72]  life because
[3114.72 --> 3115.28]  that is what
[3115.28 --> 3115.64]  the sheep
[3115.64 --> 3115.96]  need.
[3117.64 --> 3118.44]  So this is
[3118.44 --> 3118.88]  who Jesus
[3118.88 --> 3119.44]  is as our
[3119.44 --> 3119.86]  good shepherd.
[3120.24 --> 3120.58]  He is the
[3120.58 --> 3121.24]  one who knows
[3121.24 --> 3121.72]  the sheep,
[3121.72 --> 3122.36]  he is the
[3122.36 --> 3122.62]  one who
[3122.62 --> 3123.66]  leads and
[3123.66 --> 3124.18]  calls them
[3124.18 --> 3124.70]  by name.
[3125.46 --> 3125.98]  He is the
[3125.98 --> 3126.58]  one who
[3126.58 --> 3127.58]  would sacrifice
[3127.58 --> 3128.50]  himself for
[3128.50 --> 3129.00]  the sheep.
[3130.12 --> 3130.40]  And just
[3130.40 --> 3130.92]  think about how
[3130.92 --> 3131.50]  amazing this
[3131.50 --> 3131.82]  is.
[3132.20 --> 3132.54]  Can you
[3132.54 --> 3133.34]  imagine with
[3133.34 --> 3134.68]  me the
[3134.68 --> 3135.22]  people of
[3135.22 --> 3135.62]  Israel?
[3136.58 --> 3136.94]  They're
[3136.94 --> 3138.24]  reading Ezekiel
[3138.24 --> 3138.78]  34.
[3139.10 --> 3139.62]  Maybe they're
[3139.62 --> 3139.90]  in their
[3139.90 --> 3140.42]  homes,
[3140.86 --> 3141.50]  they're reading
[3141.50 --> 3142.04]  it out loud
[3142.04 --> 3142.48]  together,
[3142.68 --> 3142.98]  they're in
[3142.98 --> 3143.88]  their synagogues.
[3145.18 --> 3146.10]  Imagine them
[3146.10 --> 3146.82]  kind of reading
[3146.82 --> 3147.52]  this about how
[3147.52 --> 3148.14]  God would
[3148.14 --> 3148.68]  come,
[3149.74 --> 3150.40]  how God
[3150.40 --> 3151.96]  would heal
[3151.96 --> 3152.58]  his sheep
[3152.58 --> 3153.08]  and feed
[3153.08 --> 3153.38]  them,
[3153.48 --> 3153.82]  and just
[3153.82 --> 3154.42]  imagine what
[3154.42 --> 3154.76]  would this
[3154.76 --> 3155.32]  look like.
[3155.40 --> 3155.76]  I wonder
[3155.76 --> 3156.72]  what this
[3156.72 --> 3157.76]  kind of
[3157.76 --> 3158.84]  shepherd God
[3158.84 --> 3159.50]  would be.
[3160.60 --> 3161.08]  And then for
[3161.08 --> 3161.98]  them to think
[3161.98 --> 3162.84]  that God,
[3163.00 --> 3163.98]  who created
[3163.98 --> 3165.36]  everything in
[3165.36 --> 3165.92]  the universe,
[3166.50 --> 3167.30]  would become
[3167.30 --> 3168.90]  a man and
[3168.90 --> 3169.98]  literally call
[3169.98 --> 3170.66]  each one of
[3170.66 --> 3171.30]  his sheep by
[3171.30 --> 3171.68]  name.
[3172.38 --> 3172.88]  And then to
[3172.88 --> 3173.30]  think that he
[3173.30 --> 3173.80]  would gather
[3173.80 --> 3174.42]  his sheep,
[3175.22 --> 3175.76]  and that in
[3175.76 --> 3176.26]  doing this
[3176.26 --> 3176.86]  gathering it
[3176.86 --> 3177.52]  would cost
[3177.52 --> 3178.16]  this shepherd
[3178.16 --> 3178.92]  king his
[3178.92 --> 3179.64]  very life.
[3180.62 --> 3181.36]  But that he
[3181.36 --> 3181.74]  would do it
[3181.74 --> 3182.50]  all the same.
[3183.82 --> 3184.04]  Right?
[3184.12 --> 3184.56]  This is an
[3184.56 --> 3185.76]  amazing thought.
[3186.34 --> 3186.76]  And they
[3186.76 --> 3187.38]  wouldn't have
[3187.38 --> 3188.20]  known just
[3188.20 --> 3188.98]  how amazing
[3188.98 --> 3189.94]  that is when
[3189.94 --> 3190.58]  they read it
[3190.58 --> 3191.92]  until we
[3191.92 --> 3192.54]  see Jesus.
[3193.88 --> 3194.30]  Friends,
[3194.44 --> 3195.22]  Jesus calls
[3195.22 --> 3196.26]  you to
[3196.26 --> 3196.74]  follow him.
[3197.36 --> 3197.54]  You know,
[3197.58 --> 3197.88]  he's not
[3197.88 --> 3198.14]  going to
[3198.14 --> 3198.84]  drive you,
[3199.40 --> 3199.74]  he's not
[3199.74 --> 3199.98]  going to
[3199.98 --> 3200.64]  force you,
[3201.40 --> 3201.74]  but he
[3201.74 --> 3202.58]  calls you
[3202.58 --> 3203.44]  all the same,
[3203.48 --> 3203.88]  he calls
[3203.88 --> 3204.18]  you by
[3204.18 --> 3204.50]  name.
[3204.50 --> 3206.38]  This means
[3206.38 --> 3206.78]  that Jesus
[3206.78 --> 3207.20]  can be
[3207.20 --> 3207.68]  your shepherd.
[3209.38 --> 3210.06]  So how do
[3210.06 --> 3210.44]  we listen
[3210.44 --> 3210.94]  to the voice
[3210.94 --> 3211.30]  of Jesus?
[3211.38 --> 3211.74]  That's our
[3211.74 --> 3212.86]  final thing.
[3213.20 --> 3213.50]  How do
[3213.50 --> 3213.96]  we listen
[3213.96 --> 3214.50]  to his
[3214.50 --> 3214.92]  voice?
[3216.60 --> 3217.08]  Verses
[3217.08 --> 3217.54]  4 and
[3217.54 --> 3219.74]  5 say,
[3220.56 --> 3221.24]  when he
[3221.24 --> 3221.82]  has brought
[3221.82 --> 3222.50]  out all
[3222.50 --> 3222.78]  of his
[3222.78 --> 3223.08]  own,
[3223.60 --> 3224.12]  he goes
[3224.12 --> 3224.60]  on ahead
[3224.60 --> 3225.04]  of them,
[3225.44 --> 3226.02]  and his
[3226.02 --> 3226.68]  sheep follow
[3226.68 --> 3227.64]  him because
[3227.64 --> 3228.06]  they know
[3228.06 --> 3228.68]  his voice.
[3229.36 --> 3229.84]  But they
[3229.84 --> 3230.24]  will never
[3230.24 --> 3231.26]  follow a
[3231.26 --> 3231.64]  stranger.
[3232.14 --> 3232.50]  In fact,
[3232.56 --> 3233.06]  they will run
[3233.06 --> 3233.50]  away from
[3233.50 --> 3233.90]  him because
[3233.90 --> 3234.20]  they do
[3234.20 --> 3234.52]  not
[3234.52 --> 3235.12]  recognize
[3235.12 --> 3235.64]  a
[3235.64 --> 3236.14]  stranger's
[3236.14 --> 3236.46]  voice.
[3236.86 --> 3237.08]  You know,
[3237.12 --> 3237.40]  I really
[3237.40 --> 3237.78]  like the
[3237.78 --> 3238.04]  way this
[3238.04 --> 3238.60]  passage
[3238.60 --> 3239.58]  talks about
[3239.58 --> 3239.82]  these
[3239.82 --> 3240.32]  competing
[3240.32 --> 3240.82]  voices
[3240.82 --> 3242.12]  because
[3242.12 --> 3243.00]  it feels
[3243.00 --> 3243.56]  so much
[3243.56 --> 3243.92]  like our
[3243.92 --> 3244.28]  world.
[3244.64 --> 3244.78]  You know,
[3244.84 --> 3245.12]  we are
[3245.12 --> 3245.70]  just surrounded
[3245.70 --> 3246.68]  by so
[3246.68 --> 3247.32]  many voices
[3247.32 --> 3247.74]  that are
[3247.74 --> 3248.38]  calling for
[3248.38 --> 3248.92]  our attention.
[3249.08 --> 3249.60]  It's almost
[3249.60 --> 3250.26]  overwhelming.
[3251.84 --> 3252.66]  There are
[3252.66 --> 3253.28]  people
[3253.28 --> 3254.44]  singing
[3254.44 --> 3255.42]  for us,
[3256.00 --> 3256.36]  singing
[3256.36 --> 3257.00]  for us
[3257.00 --> 3257.80]  to follow,
[3258.96 --> 3259.20]  singing
[3259.20 --> 3259.88]  for us
[3259.88 --> 3262.18]  to invest
[3262.18 --> 3263.16]  in them,
[3263.30 --> 3263.94]  to follow
[3263.94 --> 3264.28]  them,
[3264.38 --> 3264.66]  to find
[3264.66 --> 3265.18]  our identity
[3265.18 --> 3265.78]  in them.
[3267.06 --> 3267.32]  You know,
[3267.40 --> 3267.72]  and we
[3267.72 --> 3268.04]  have been
[3268.04 --> 3268.28]  taught,
[3268.38 --> 3268.82]  especially in
[3268.82 --> 3269.30]  the West,
[3270.08 --> 3271.06]  to be
[3271.06 --> 3272.04]  self-confident,
[3272.70 --> 3273.04]  to be
[3273.04 --> 3273.34]  kind of
[3273.34 --> 3274.02]  independent.
[3275.06 --> 3275.58]  But the
[3275.58 --> 3276.26]  fact is,
[3276.38 --> 3276.84]  we are
[3276.84 --> 3277.48]  very much
[3277.48 --> 3278.26]  like sheep
[3278.26 --> 3278.72]  in that,
[3278.86 --> 3279.56]  like sheep,
[3279.74 --> 3280.44]  we have a
[3280.44 --> 3281.54]  tendency to
[3281.54 --> 3281.88]  follow.
[3283.34 --> 3284.40]  Like us,
[3284.66 --> 3284.82]  you know,
[3284.88 --> 3285.38]  a sheep's
[3285.38 --> 3285.96]  bent toward
[3285.96 --> 3286.60]  following can
[3286.60 --> 3287.24]  actually lead
[3287.24 --> 3287.52]  them into
[3287.52 --> 3288.18]  very dangerous
[3288.18 --> 3288.88]  situations.
[3288.88 --> 3289.80]  You know,
[3289.88 --> 3290.40]  where one
[3290.40 --> 3291.34]  sheep moves
[3291.34 --> 3292.26]  or leads,
[3292.50 --> 3292.90]  the rest
[3292.90 --> 3293.38]  of the sheep
[3293.38 --> 3293.94]  will just
[3293.94 --> 3294.64]  blindly follow.
[3295.64 --> 3296.04]  And even
[3296.04 --> 3296.58]  if it doesn't
[3296.58 --> 3297.06]  seem like a
[3297.06 --> 3297.70]  good idea,
[3298.12 --> 3298.76]  the flocking
[3298.76 --> 3299.40]  and following
[3299.40 --> 3300.24]  instinct of
[3300.24 --> 3300.60]  sheep,
[3301.04 --> 3301.42]  and I would
[3301.42 --> 3302.00]  argue of
[3302.00 --> 3302.52]  humans as
[3302.52 --> 3302.80]  well,
[3303.46 --> 3303.94]  is so
[3303.94 --> 3304.94]  strong that
[3304.94 --> 3306.34]  in 2006
[3306.34 --> 3307.42]  in Istanbul,
[3307.60 --> 3307.98]  Turkey,
[3308.62 --> 3310.56]  450 sheep
[3310.56 --> 3312.74]  actually plunged
[3312.74 --> 3313.20]  to their
[3313.20 --> 3313.90]  deaths as
[3313.90 --> 3314.42]  they followed
[3314.42 --> 3315.08]  one sheep
[3315.08 --> 3315.98]  who thought
[3315.98 --> 3316.24]  it could
[3316.24 --> 3316.60]  cross a
[3316.60 --> 3316.90]  ravine.
[3316.90 --> 3318.34]  All the
[3318.34 --> 3318.66]  rest of
[3318.66 --> 3319.10]  the sheep,
[3319.56 --> 3320.46]  450 of
[3320.46 --> 3320.58]  them,
[3320.74 --> 3321.96]  followed and
[3321.96 --> 3322.54]  also died.
[3323.44 --> 3323.90]  And I think
[3323.90 --> 3324.34]  this is a
[3324.34 --> 3324.80]  fascinating
[3324.80 --> 3325.50]  picture of
[3325.50 --> 3326.22]  the reality
[3326.22 --> 3327.12]  of our
[3327.12 --> 3328.46]  need for
[3328.46 --> 3329.02]  guidance,
[3329.32 --> 3329.92]  for our
[3329.92 --> 3330.42]  need for
[3330.42 --> 3330.92]  protection,
[3331.70 --> 3331.92]  and to
[3331.92 --> 3332.28]  listen to
[3332.28 --> 3332.68]  the right
[3332.68 --> 3333.20]  voice.
[3334.78 --> 3335.74]  Verse 5
[3335.74 --> 3336.54]  says that
[3336.54 --> 3338.22]  another voice,
[3338.34 --> 3339.22]  another shepherd
[3339.22 --> 3340.84]  may speak to
[3340.84 --> 3341.28]  the sheep
[3341.28 --> 3343.26]  and call to
[3343.26 --> 3343.94]  them or sing
[3343.94 --> 3344.74]  them a song,
[3345.46 --> 3346.06]  but the
[3346.06 --> 3346.64]  people who
[3346.64 --> 3347.24]  belong to
[3347.24 --> 3347.96]  Jesus won't
[3347.96 --> 3348.34]  listen.
[3348.70 --> 3349.22]  They'll stand
[3349.22 --> 3350.40]  there, but
[3350.40 --> 3350.76]  they won't
[3350.76 --> 3351.04]  go.
[3352.46 --> 3352.98]  And that
[3352.98 --> 3353.44]  doesn't mean
[3353.44 --> 3353.80]  that the
[3353.80 --> 3354.80]  sheep don't
[3354.80 --> 3355.18]  perk up
[3355.18 --> 3355.84]  their ears.
[3356.32 --> 3356.86]  It doesn't
[3356.86 --> 3357.18]  mean that
[3357.18 --> 3357.52]  they don't
[3357.52 --> 3358.20]  hear this
[3358.20 --> 3358.72]  song or
[3358.72 --> 3359.26]  hear this
[3359.26 --> 3359.82]  other call,
[3360.36 --> 3360.94]  whether it
[3360.94 --> 3361.38]  comes from
[3361.38 --> 3362.06]  a person or
[3362.06 --> 3362.60]  the culture.
[3363.22 --> 3363.88]  They hear
[3363.88 --> 3365.56]  it, but
[3365.56 --> 3365.96]  they don't
[3365.96 --> 3366.50]  follow it
[3366.50 --> 3366.96]  because it's
[3366.96 --> 3367.32]  not the
[3367.32 --> 3368.30]  voice of
[3368.30 --> 3368.76]  their shepherd.
[3369.00 --> 3369.30]  And friends,
[3369.38 --> 3370.04]  we hear
[3370.04 --> 3371.22]  temptations to
[3371.22 --> 3371.74]  follow all
[3371.74 --> 3372.14]  kinds of
[3372.14 --> 3372.62]  voices, and
[3372.62 --> 3373.00]  there's nothing
[3373.00 --> 3373.98]  sinful or wrong
[3373.98 --> 3374.90]  about these
[3374.90 --> 3375.36]  temptations
[3375.36 --> 3375.92]  coming to
[3375.92 --> 3376.22]  us.
[3376.96 --> 3377.52]  But for
[3377.52 --> 3377.94]  the people
[3377.94 --> 3379.30]  of God, we
[3379.30 --> 3379.92]  hear it and
[3379.92 --> 3380.44]  we recognize
[3380.44 --> 3380.96]  it for what
[3380.96 --> 3381.24]  it is.
[3381.28 --> 3381.76]  It's not our
[3381.76 --> 3382.94]  shepherd, and
[3382.94 --> 3383.32]  so we don't
[3383.32 --> 3383.94]  follow it.
[3384.88 --> 3385.72]  Because out of
[3385.72 --> 3386.28]  all of the
[3386.28 --> 3386.82]  voices that
[3386.82 --> 3387.36]  call, there
[3387.36 --> 3388.10]  is the voice
[3388.10 --> 3388.58]  of our
[3388.58 --> 3389.24]  shepherd Jesus
[3389.24 --> 3391.08]  who calls
[3391.08 --> 3391.38]  us to
[3391.38 --> 3392.02]  follow him.
[3392.26 --> 3392.66]  It's not
[3392.66 --> 3393.18]  for his
[3393.18 --> 3393.88]  own gain,
[3394.40 --> 3395.14]  not like a
[3395.14 --> 3395.58]  thief or a
[3395.58 --> 3396.18]  hired hand,
[3396.28 --> 3397.22]  but as the
[3397.22 --> 3397.96]  owner of the
[3397.96 --> 3398.82]  sheep, the
[3398.82 --> 3399.48]  one who came
[3399.48 --> 3400.42]  and gave
[3400.42 --> 3401.92]  his life for
[3401.92 --> 3402.34]  us.
[3402.34 --> 3403.72]  He loves
[3403.72 --> 3404.64]  you, and
[3404.64 --> 3405.40]  he wants to
[3405.40 --> 3405.98]  lead you into
[3405.98 --> 3406.38]  life.
[3407.54 --> 3408.04]  So friends,
[3408.12 --> 3408.46]  here's the
[3408.46 --> 3408.98]  question for
[3408.98 --> 3409.74]  us this
[3409.74 --> 3410.04]  morning.
[3410.96 --> 3411.30]  That when
[3411.30 --> 3412.26]  the God of
[3412.26 --> 3413.02]  the universe
[3413.02 --> 3414.04]  sings for
[3414.04 --> 3415.98]  you, will
[3415.98 --> 3416.50]  you follow?
[3417.62 --> 3418.32]  Will you
[3418.32 --> 3418.94]  listen to
[3418.94 --> 3419.56]  his voice?
[3420.28 --> 3420.72]  And you know
[3420.72 --> 3420.86]  what?
[3420.90 --> 3421.42]  He has done
[3421.42 --> 3423.30]  everything necessary
[3423.30 --> 3424.48]  for you to
[3424.48 --> 3424.94]  belong to
[3424.94 --> 3425.12]  him.
[3425.12 --> 3427.32]  Jesus says,
[3427.44 --> 3427.84]  my sheep
[3427.84 --> 3428.32]  listen to
[3428.32 --> 3428.98]  my voice.
[3429.72 --> 3430.44]  I know
[3430.44 --> 3432.20]  them, and
[3432.20 --> 3432.74]  they follow
[3432.74 --> 3433.02]  me.
[3434.16 --> 3434.76]  So would
[3434.76 --> 3435.70]  you pray with
[3435.70 --> 3435.92]  me?
[3436.60 --> 3437.12]  Let's pray
[3437.12 --> 3437.74]  that Jesus
[3437.74 --> 3438.60]  would help
[3438.60 --> 3438.94]  us to
[3438.94 --> 3439.36]  follow him.
[3442.78 --> 3443.62]  Father, we
[3443.62 --> 3444.26]  thank you
[3444.26 --> 3447.38]  that when
[3447.38 --> 3448.10]  you saw
[3448.10 --> 3448.90]  no good
[3448.90 --> 3449.52]  shepherds,
[3450.08 --> 3450.66]  because all
[3450.66 --> 3451.14]  of us are
[3451.14 --> 3451.76]  sinners and
[3451.76 --> 3453.20]  broken, you
[3453.20 --> 3453.92]  came yourself.
[3454.02 --> 3454.24]  You didn't
[3454.24 --> 3455.10]  abandon us to
[3455.10 --> 3455.60]  the wolves.
[3456.52 --> 3456.94]  You didn't
[3456.94 --> 3457.82]  leave us to
[3457.82 --> 3458.62]  bad shepherds,
[3459.02 --> 3459.88]  but you sent
[3459.88 --> 3460.88]  our good
[3460.88 --> 3461.20]  shepherd.
[3461.34 --> 3461.58]  You sent
[3461.58 --> 3462.14]  Jesus to
[3462.14 --> 3462.40]  come.
[3463.02 --> 3463.34]  You sent
[3463.34 --> 3463.52]  him to
[3463.52 --> 3464.90]  come, to
[3464.90 --> 3467.28]  call us, and
[3467.28 --> 3467.84]  Lord, we just
[3467.84 --> 3468.46]  ask that you
[3468.46 --> 3468.98]  would help us
[3468.98 --> 3469.50]  to listen to
[3469.50 --> 3470.04]  his voice.
[3471.18 --> 3471.62]  Lord, there's
[3471.62 --> 3472.32]  so many voices
[3472.32 --> 3473.96]  that we hear, and
[3473.96 --> 3474.48]  out of those
[3474.48 --> 3475.06]  voices, would
[3475.06 --> 3475.74]  you tune our
[3475.74 --> 3476.40]  hearts to
[3476.40 --> 3477.28]  hear the voice
[3477.28 --> 3478.42]  of our good
[3478.42 --> 3478.90]  shepherd, and
[3478.90 --> 3479.40]  would you give
[3479.40 --> 3480.52]  us the grace
[3480.52 --> 3481.24]  to follow him,
[3481.76 --> 3482.32]  and that following
[3482.32 --> 3482.98]  him, we would
[3482.98 --> 3484.08]  have life
[3484.08 --> 3484.46]  abundant.
[3485.76 --> 3486.66]  Lord, we pray
[3486.66 --> 3487.60]  that as we go
[3487.60 --> 3488.20]  out following
[3488.20 --> 3489.10]  this shepherd, out
[3489.10 --> 3490.00]  into the pasture,
[3490.14 --> 3490.72]  out into the
[3490.72 --> 3491.94]  world, and as
[3491.94 --> 3492.64]  Jesus says, he
[3492.64 --> 3493.34]  has more sheep
[3493.34 --> 3493.94]  who are not of
[3493.94 --> 3494.56]  his fold that
[3494.56 --> 3495.24]  he will also
[3495.24 --> 3495.56]  call.
[3496.22 --> 3497.06]  Help us be
[3497.06 --> 3497.52]  sheep who
[3497.52 --> 3498.10]  would also
[3498.10 --> 3499.68]  follow and
[3499.68 --> 3500.80]  lead others,
[3501.22 --> 3501.48]  Lord, to
[3501.48 --> 3502.14]  follow Jesus.
[3502.70 --> 3503.34]  We pray in
[3503.34 --> 3504.04]  his holy name.
[3504.60 --> 3504.84]  Amen.
[3505.88 --> 3506.52]  So let's sing
[3506.52 --> 3507.02]  our song of
[3507.02 --> 3507.74]  response together.
[3507.74 --> 3508.02]  water.
[3513.08 --> 3513.14]  Amen.
[3515.26 --> 3515.62]  Amen.
[3515.70 --> 3516.36]  Amen.
[3516.36 --> 3516.78]  Amen.
[3516.78 --> 3517.22] aus
[3537.74 --> 3540.82]  I'll not want.
[3541.38 --> 3543.64]  He makes me lie
[3543.64 --> 3546.68]  in pastures green.
[3547.96 --> 3550.38]  He leads me by
[3550.38 --> 3554.24]  the still, still waters.
[3555.46 --> 3560.38]  His goodness restores my soul.
[3561.98 --> 3567.06]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3567.74 --> 3573.74]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3575.24 --> 3582.02]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[3582.56 --> 3587.22]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[3589.22 --> 3593.72]  He guides my ways in righteousness.
[3593.72 --> 3601.48]  And he anoints my head with oil.
[3602.22 --> 3607.72]  And my cup it overflows with joy.
[3607.72 --> 3614.04]  I feast on his pure delights.
[3614.04 --> 3620.04]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3620.04 --> 3626.80]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3627.80 --> 3634.04]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[3635.04 --> 3640.04]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[3640.04 --> 3648.04]  And though I walk the darkest path,
[3648.54 --> 3654.04]  I will not fear the evil one.
[3654.04 --> 3658.04]  For you are with me.
[3658.04 --> 3662.38]  And your rod and staff
[3662.38 --> 3667.04]  Are the comfort I need to know.
[3667.04 --> 3673.04]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3673.04 --> 3675.04]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3675.04 --> 3681.04]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3681.04 --> 3683.04]  For your endless mercy.
[3683.04 --> 3689.04]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[3689.04 --> 3691.04]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[3691.04 --> 3695.04]  Your goodness will lead me home.
[3695.04 --> 3700.34]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3700.56 --> 3703.04]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3703.04 --> 3708.56]  And I will trust in you alone.
[3709.04 --> 3716.04]  For your endless mercy follows me.
[3716.04 --> 3723.54]  Your goodness will lead me home
[3723.54 --> 3730.82]  Would you please join me in prayer
[3730.82 --> 3735.46]  As we bring our concerns to our Good Shepherd
[3735.46 --> 3739.02]  The concerns that we have individually as a church and for the world
[3739.02 --> 3743.20]  Heavenly Father
[3743.20 --> 3748.58]  All wise, all seeing, holy, merciful and just
[3748.58 --> 3755.30]  Will you hear the prayers of your children as you promise and as we trust in your faithfulness
[3755.30 --> 3758.76]  The Lord Jesus risen Savior and Shepherd
[3758.76 --> 3763.10]  You save to the uttermost those who draw near to you
[3763.10 --> 3766.04]  And so we do come before you
[3766.04 --> 3770.30]  Holy Spirit, Comforter and Friend
[3770.30 --> 3775.06]  Will you shape our messy and scattered prayers
[3775.06 --> 3779.00]  Will you bring the groanings of our hearts to the Father
[3779.00 --> 3786.40]  How long, O Lord, how long will this pandemic rage on
[3786.40 --> 3793.04]  Again and again we are weary beyond words and we long, Father, for deliverance
[3793.04 --> 3796.24]  We long for health, we long for wholeness
[3796.24 --> 3798.80]  We long for joy and closeness
[3798.80 --> 3800.64]  Being with the ones we love
[3800.64 --> 3804.58]  We long for flourishing in our societies
[3804.58 --> 3806.10]  In businesses
[3806.10 --> 3812.18]  We long, Lord, for you to make things whole again
[3812.18 --> 3815.82]  Not just for our own sakes, Lord, but for the whole world
[3815.82 --> 3821.08]  And we dare not put our ultimate trust even in the best laid of human plans
[3821.08 --> 3823.84]  In a vaccine or any other cure
[3823.84 --> 3827.46]  And while those things are good gifts from you
[3827.46 --> 3830.30]  Our trust ultimately is in you alone
[3830.30 --> 3834.26]  And so, Lord, we ask from you for the patience
[3834.26 --> 3836.70]  To wait for your deliverance
[3836.70 --> 3841.42]  For the patience to work with one another in our communities
[3841.42 --> 3842.86]  In our nations
[3842.86 --> 3845.52]  The patience to love our neighbors
[3845.52 --> 3847.92]  As you have called us to love them
[3847.92 --> 3855.68]  Lord, we mourn alongside those who have recently lost loved ones
[3855.68 --> 3857.36]  Even in our own church community
[3857.36 --> 3862.32]  And you say that the death of your saints is precious in your sight
[3862.32 --> 3867.32]  So we remind those who mourn that you remain their good shepherd
[3867.32 --> 3868.60]  And that you are with them
[3868.60 --> 3871.42]  And that you have not taken your hand away from them
[3871.42 --> 3876.18]  And, Lord, you promised that you would come
[3876.18 --> 3878.34]  And heal those who are sick
[3878.34 --> 3881.00]  That you would bind up the injured
[3881.00 --> 3883.76]  And, Lord, so we ask for your healing
[3883.76 --> 3885.28]  For those among us who are sick
[3885.28 --> 3888.24]  We pray for John Van Toll
[3888.24 --> 3890.10]  John Ram, Greg Van Toll
[3890.10 --> 3892.98]  And, Lord, we ask for your full healing
[3892.98 --> 3896.78]  Lord, we pray for them and for others
[3896.78 --> 3901.98]  Who we know that, Lord, need your healing touch in their lives
[3901.98 --> 3903.10]  Whether it's for sight
[3903.10 --> 3909.06]  Whether it is for the legs to walk
[3909.06 --> 3912.06]  Lord, would you have mercy
[3912.06 --> 3913.94]  And put your healing hands upon all
[3913.94 --> 3919.64]  Lord, we also pray for our political leaders here in B.C. and in Canada
[3919.64 --> 3923.54]  Lord, may they use their authority humbly
[3923.54 --> 3927.00]  Judiciously and always seeking wise counsel
[3927.00 --> 3932.28]  Give them servant hearts that pursue good for all people everywhere
[3932.28 --> 3935.24]  Finally, as your church
[3935.24 --> 3937.78]  We ask for your Holy Spirit to work in us
[3937.78 --> 3942.14]  Conforming us to the image of you, our Lord Jesus Christ
[3942.14 --> 3946.14]  Help us to follow Jesus' leading and his guidance
[3946.14 --> 3950.34]  Dwell among us by the power of your Spirit
[3950.34 --> 3951.68]  Help us to speak
[3951.68 --> 3954.76]  And also to comport ourselves in the world
[3954.76 --> 3957.10]  In a way that brings honor, not to ourselves
[3957.10 --> 3959.50]  But brings honor to your name
[3959.50 --> 3961.02]  The name of our King
[3961.02 --> 3965.52]  Lord, again, we bring all these petitions
[3965.52 --> 3967.04]  Our cares, our concerns
[3967.04 --> 3968.24]  The groans of our heart
[3968.24 --> 3969.62]  Before you
[3969.62 --> 3972.08]  Because you listen to us
[3972.08 --> 3973.10]  You know your sheep
[3973.10 --> 3976.68]  And your sheep listen to your voice
[3976.68 --> 3979.04]  We pray in Jesus' name
[3979.04 --> 3980.32]  Amen
[3980.32 --> 3983.56]  So friends, we also
[3983.56 --> 3986.60]  As we end our time of worship
[3986.60 --> 3989.52]  We go out with our Heavenly Father
[3989.52 --> 3991.70]  Speaking the last words over us
[3991.70 --> 3993.50]  He calls us to worship
[3993.50 --> 3995.16]  And he sends us out
[3995.16 --> 3997.00]  With his blessing upon us
[3997.00 --> 3998.84]  As he leads us out into the world
[3998.84 --> 4002.14]  So I invite you to hold out your hands
[4002.14 --> 4004.52]  As a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing
[4004.52 --> 4007.42]  Now may the God of peace
[4007.42 --> 4008.94]  Who brought again from the dead
[4008.94 --> 4010.10]  Our Lord Jesus Christ
[4010.10 --> 4011.44]  The great shepherd of the sheep
[4011.44 --> 4013.84]  By the blood of the eternal covenant
[4013.84 --> 4016.30]  Equip you with everything good
[4016.30 --> 4018.14]  That you may do his will
[4018.14 --> 4021.42]  Working in us that which is pleasing in his sight
[4021.42 --> 4023.94]  Through Jesus Christ to whom be glory
[4023.94 --> 4025.56]  Forever and ever
[4025.56 --> 4026.64]  Amen
[4034.52 --> 4049.44]  When we walk with the Lord
[4049.44 --> 4053.16]  In the heart of his word
[4053.16 --> 4059.20]  What a glory he sheds on our way
[4059.20 --> 4063.10]  While we do his good will
[4063.10 --> 4066.94]  He abides with us still
[4066.94 --> 4072.10]  And with all who will trust and obey
[4072.10 --> 4076.02]  Trust and obey
[4076.02 --> 4080.46]  For there's no other way
[4080.46 --> 4084.36]  To be happy in Jesus
[4084.36 --> 4088.90]  But to trust and obey
[4088.90 --> 4095.78]  But we never can prove
[4095.78 --> 4099.72]  The delights of his love
[4099.72 --> 4105.68]  Until all on the altar we lay
[4105.68 --> 4109.74]  For the favour he shows
[4109.74 --> 4113.48]  And the joy he bestows
[4113.48 --> 4118.48]  Are for those who will trust and obey
[4118.48 --> 4122.48]  Trust and obey
[4122.48 --> 4123.48]  Trust and obey
[4123.48 --> 4127.48]  For there's no other way
[4127.48 --> 4131.48]  To be happy in Jesus
[4131.48 --> 4136.48]  But to trust and obey
[4136.48 --> 4142.48]  And in fellowships meet
[4142.48 --> 4146.90]  We will sit at his feet
[4146.90 --> 4152.48]  Or go on by his side in the way
[4152.48 --> 4156.48]  What he says we will do
[4156.48 --> 4160.48]  When he says we will do
[4160.48 --> 4163.48]  Never fear only
[4163.48 --> 4165.48]  Trust and obey
[4165.48 --> 4166.48]  Trust and obey
[4166.48 --> 4169.48]  Trust and obey
[4169.48 --> 4174.48]  For there's no other way
[4174.48 --> 4177.48]  To be happy in Jesus
[4177.48 --> 4178.48]  Thank you
[4178.48 --> 4179.48]  Trust and obey
[4179.48 --> 4180.48]  Jesus
[4180.48 --> 4184.48]  Let you trust and obey
[4184.48 --> 4188.48]  Trust and obey
[4188.48 --> 4192.48]  What you say
