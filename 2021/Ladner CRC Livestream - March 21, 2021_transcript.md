[312.96 --> 318.96]  Good morning, everyone, and welcome to worship this morning at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[318.96 --> 320.96]  My name is Jason Truel.
[320.96 --> 327.96]  I am the lead pastor here, and I am so glad that you are joining us this morning, and we
[327.96 --> 331.96]  welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[331.96 --> 333.96]  Here we are.
[333.96 --> 335.96]  We are still not gathered.
[335.96 --> 338.96]  We're still live streaming.
[338.96 --> 344.96]  And, you know, some of you might be wondering, well, you know, when can we come back?
[344.96 --> 351.96]  And just to be clear, the answer is we are still following the guidelines of our health authorities.
[351.96 --> 358.96]  Churches are still not allowed to meet in person, and that's why we are not, in all of British Columbia.
[358.96 --> 365.96]  And so we will continue to abide by these restrictions until they are lifted.
[365.96 --> 375.96]  So one offering for this morning, our New Immigrant Support Fund is our designated offering for today.
[375.96 --> 385.96]  And this New Immigrant Support Fund helps to sponsor refugees, and it helps us to take care of them during their first year here in Canada.
[385.96 --> 387.96]  And so you can give online.
[387.96 --> 390.96]  You can also mail or drop in a check, and we appreciate your support.
[390.96 --> 397.96]  So now, would you please join in the call to worship with me?
[397.96 --> 400.96]  And we will say it responsibly where it's bold.
[400.96 --> 403.96]  I would ask you to participate and read it out loud.
[403.96 --> 406.96]  And this comes from Psalm 73.
[406.96 --> 407.96]  Psalm 74.
[407.96 --> 408.96]  Psalm 76.
[408.96 --> 409.96]  Psalm 76.
[409.96 --> 411.96]  I am always with you.
[411.96 --> 414.96]  You hold me by my right hand.
[414.96 --> 421.96]  You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.
[421.96 --> 426.96]  Whom have I in heaven but you?
[426.96 --> 429.96]  And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
[429.96 --> 438.28]  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[438.86 --> 448.00]  So as we come together and come before the Lord this morning, let me lead us in a prayer of adoration.
[448.54 --> 449.36]  Let's pray together.
[449.36 --> 462.80]  Father, Son, Holy Spirit, we praise you this morning because you are the God who is strong and powerful and sovereign over all things.
[463.42 --> 474.56]  And in your strength, you are powerful enough to hold us secure, to hold us in your hand, to guide us with the wisdom that you have because you know all things.
[474.56 --> 480.90]  And Lord, you are able to satisfy the deepest desires of every human heart.
[481.60 --> 486.50]  There is nothing, Lord, that we desire but to know you and to be known by you.
[487.40 --> 496.06]  And so this morning, Lord, wherever each one of us is sitting and participating this morning, would you gather us to yourself?
[497.00 --> 502.50]  Would you quiet our hearts, free us from the distractions that may be around us?
[502.50 --> 509.62]  But Lord, by your Holy Spirit, Lord, would you help us to worship you in spirit and in truth this morning?
[510.16 --> 513.14]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[514.14 --> 517.70]  And so let's sing some songs of praise together.
[517.70 --> 517.82]  Amen.
[532.50 --> 532.86]  Amen.
[532.94 --> 547.98]  Amen.
[547.98 --> 549.64]  Amen.
[549.64 --> 551.30]  Amen.
[551.30 --> 565.30]  Bring from the Lord of Adam and call him Lord of all.
[567.30 --> 576.30]  O seed of Israel's chosen race, now ransom for the fall.
[576.30 --> 602.30]  Hail Him who saves you by His grace and crown Him Lord of all.
[602.30 --> 614.30]  O man, in all the sacred cross we at His feet may fall.
[614.30 --> 628.30]  We'll join the everlasting song and crown Him Lord of all.
[628.30 --> 643.30]  We'll join the everlasting song and crown Him Lord of all.
[643.30 --> 656.30]  Our next hymn, Beneath the Cross of Jesus, is a well-known and beautiful Lenten hymn.
[656.30 --> 668.30]  It was penned in 1869 by a Presbyterian Scottish lass, Elizabeth Clefand, who wrote the words just before she died at the young age of 39.
[668.30 --> 679.30]  Elizabeth was a very kind person who loved writing poetry and she also really knew her Bible well, as there are many references in the song to Bible passages.
[679.30 --> 684.30]  We should note the paradoxical language used in the hymn.
[684.30 --> 696.30]  Whereas death on a cross is an instrument of the cruelest torture, Elizabeth found comfort in the shadow of the cross and expresses the inspiration that the cross gave her.
[696.30 --> 703.30]  She looks at the cross and sees there her Lord and Savior who suffered there for me.
[703.30 --> 707.30]  The hymn is a personal meditation and confession for her.
[707.30 --> 715.30]  As she says, My sinful self, my only shame, my glory, all the cross.
[715.30 --> 730.30]  The hymn is a personal meditation and the hymn.
[730.30 --> 742.30]  Beneath the cross of Jesus, I long to take my stand.
[742.30 --> 754.30]  The shadow of the mighty rock within our weary land.
[754.30 --> 766.30]  A holy of eternalness, a rest of the night awake.
[766.30 --> 773.30]  From the shining of the noontide heat.
[773.30 --> 779.30]  And the light of the day.
[779.30 --> 793.30]  Upon the cross of Jesus, my eye at times can see.
[793.30 --> 806.30]  The very dying form of one who suffered there for me.
[806.30 --> 818.30]  And from my contrite heart hinted to wonders I confess.
[818.30 --> 819.30]  The sands of his glorious love.
[819.30 --> 820.30]  And my unworthiness.
[820.30 --> 825.30]  I'll stay across your shadow.
[825.30 --> 831.30]  For my abiding place.
[831.30 --> 832.30]  I ask God's sunshine.
[832.30 --> 833.30]  The sunshine of his face.
[833.30 --> 834.30]  I ask God's sunshine.
[834.30 --> 835.30]  The sunshine of his face.
[835.30 --> 836.30]  I ask God's sunshine.
[836.30 --> 837.30]  what I am.
[837.30 --> 838.30]  Who is outline?
[838.30 --> 839.30] asten.
[839.30 --> 840.30]  If the sun go.
[840.30 --> 861.98]  Earl F
[861.98 --> 871.78]  And to let the world go far, to know I'll gain no loss.
[871.78 --> 887.78]  I sent myself my only shame, my glory above the cross.
[891.98 --> 917.28]  How great the chasm that lay between us,
[917.28 --> 924.28]  how high the mountain I could not climb.
[924.28 --> 938.28]  In desperation I turned to heaven, and spoke your name into the night.
[938.28 --> 951.28]  Then through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[951.28 --> 966.28]  The work is finished, the end is written, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[966.28 --> 973.28]  Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[973.28 --> 981.28]  One heart could fathom such boundless grace.
[981.28 --> 996.28]  The God of ages stepped down from glory, to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[996.28 --> 1003.28]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven.
[1003.28 --> 1010.28]  The King of kings calls me missing.
[1010.28 --> 1017.28]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever.
[1017.28 --> 1024.28]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1024.28 --> 1025.28]  Hallelujah!
[1025.28 --> 1026.28]  Hallelujah!
[1026.28 --> 1031.28]  Praise the one who set me free.
[1031.28 --> 1032.28]  Hallelujah!
[1032.28 --> 1038.28]  Death has lost its grip on me.
[1038.28 --> 1042.28]  You have broken every chain.
[1042.28 --> 1045.28]  There's salvation in your name.
[1045.28 --> 1046.28]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1046.28 --> 1052.28]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1052.28 --> 1066.28]  Then came the morning and sealed the promise.
[1066.28 --> 1073.28]  Your buried body, your buried body, began to bleed.
[1073.28 --> 1087.28]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion, declared the grave has no grave on me.
[1087.28 --> 1088.28]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1088.28 --> 1089.28]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1089.28 --> 1090.28]  Let's go.
[1090.28 --> 1093.28]  When came the morning and sealed the promise.
[1093.28 --> 1094.28]  Your buried body, began to breathe.
[1094.28 --> 1113.28]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion, declared the grave has no grave on me.
[1113.28 --> 1121.22]  Jesus, yours is the victory
[1121.22 --> 1129.90]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[1129.90 --> 1136.44]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[1136.44 --> 1139.86]  You have broken every chain
[1139.86 --> 1143.12]  There's salvation in your name
[1143.12 --> 1149.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1149.22 --> 1155.78]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1155.78 --> 1163.78]  O God, you are my living hope
[1163.78 --> 1176.54]  So we come now to this time of confession together
[1176.54 --> 1181.30]  And what Jesus has done is he has broken the curse of sin
[1181.30 --> 1184.70]  Our sin keeps us from God
[1184.70 --> 1189.00]  And in our own ways, even though we know we are God's beloved
[1189.00 --> 1192.00]  We experience the effects of the curse in our lives
[1192.00 --> 1195.86]  We reject God and we go our own ways
[1195.86 --> 1202.96]  Basically because many times we just forget that God is actually present and active and living
[1202.96 --> 1204.86]  And loving to us
[1204.86 --> 1208.50]  And so in our confession this morning, we confess as those
[1208.50 --> 1212.12]  For whom the price has been paid
[1212.12 --> 1218.56]  And we confess as those whom Christ has rescued unto himself
[1218.56 --> 1222.60]  And so as we prepare to confess together
[1222.60 --> 1229.54]  Let's just take a moment to rest in our belovedness
[1229.54 --> 1233.76]  To rest in the fact that we have been rescued
[1233.76 --> 1236.54]  That we are free, that we are safe in Christ
[1236.54 --> 1240.50]  So give you a moment and let's kind of rest in that fact
[1240.50 --> 1241.36]  In our hearts
[1241.36 --> 1246.18]  Then we will say the words of confession together
[1246.18 --> 1266.14]  Father, you see all things
[1266.14 --> 1271.54]  We have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed
[1271.54 --> 1274.90]  Blot out our transgressions
[1274.90 --> 1277.68]  Be merciful to us sinners
[1277.68 --> 1282.18]  And grant that our names may be found written in the book of life
[1282.18 --> 1285.84]  For the sake of Christ Jesus, our Savior
[1285.84 --> 1287.46]  Amen
[1287.46 --> 1292.58]  So now hear these words of grace
[1292.58 --> 1295.84]  This assurance of pardon from Hebrews chapter 12
[1295.84 --> 1299.94]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses
[1299.94 --> 1302.86]  Let us throw off everything that hinders
[1302.86 --> 1305.56]  And the sin that so easily entangles
[1305.56 --> 1308.22]  And let us run with perseverance
[1308.22 --> 1311.24]  The race marked out for us
[1311.24 --> 1314.16]  Fixing our eyes on Jesus
[1314.16 --> 1317.38]  The pioneer and perfecter of faith
[1317.38 --> 1319.56]  For the joy set before him
[1319.56 --> 1320.80]  He endured the cross
[1320.80 --> 1322.58]  Scorning its shame
[1322.58 --> 1326.74]  And sat down at the right hand of the throne of God
[1326.74 --> 1329.74]  Friends, may the peace of Christ be with you
[1329.74 --> 1332.20]  And also with you
[1332.20 --> 1334.10]  And so let's sing together now
[1334.10 --> 1336.60]  Our song of response
[1336.60 --> 1338.20]  To what God has done for us
[1338.20 --> 1347.92]  I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene
[1347.92 --> 1362.02]  I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene
[1362.02 --> 1367.44]  And wonder how he could love me
[1367.44 --> 1372.02]  A sinner condemned unpleased
[1372.02 --> 1377.96]  How marvelous, how wonderful, how wonderful
[1377.96 --> 1382.92]  And my song shall ever be
[1382.92 --> 1387.88]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[1387.88 --> 1393.76]  Is my Savior's love for me
[1393.76 --> 1400.98]  He took my sins and my sorrows
[1400.98 --> 1405.74]  He made them his very own
[1405.74 --> 1411.64]  He bore the burden to Calvary
[1411.64 --> 1415.70]  And suffered and died alone
[1415.70 --> 1422.54]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[1422.54 --> 1427.60]  And my song shall ever be
[1427.60 --> 1432.70]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[1432.70 --> 1438.98]  Is my Savior's love for me
[1438.98 --> 1445.42]  And with the ransomed glory
[1445.42 --> 1450.52]  His face I at last shall see
[1450.52 --> 1453.52]  T'will be my joy
[1453.52 --> 1456.46]  T'will be my joy through the ages
[1456.46 --> 1461.68]  To sing of his love for me
[1461.68 --> 1467.62]  How marvelous, how marvelous, how wonderful
[1467.62 --> 1467.74]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[1467.74 --> 1472.74]  And my song shall ever be
[1472.74 --> 1478.06]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[1478.06 --> 1484.68]  Is my Savior's love for me
[1484.68 --> 1503.42]  So good morning again on this bit of a drizzly day
[1503.42 --> 1508.58]  Today we are continuing in our sermon series called On the Cross
[1508.58 --> 1511.76]  And in doing that we are considering
[1511.76 --> 1514.46]  The significance of Jesus' death
[1514.46 --> 1517.52]  So every week we have been looking at a different aspect
[1517.52 --> 1518.48]  Or a different angle
[1518.48 --> 1521.60]  Of what Christ accomplished for us
[1521.60 --> 1523.00]  On the cross
[1523.00 --> 1525.64]  And today I want to jump right into the passage
[1525.64 --> 1528.18]  And so we will be reading today
[1528.18 --> 1529.28]  In the book of Hebrews
[1529.28 --> 1532.34]  We will be reading a couple verses in chapter 9
[1532.34 --> 1534.66]  And a couple verses in chapter 10
[1534.66 --> 1538.60]  And so we will have those up on the screen for us
[1538.60 --> 1541.12]  But it is chapter 9 verses 11 to 14
[1541.12 --> 1542.76]  If you have your paper Bibles
[1542.76 --> 1545.28]  Hebrews 9, 11 to 14
[1545.28 --> 1548.34]  Then we will read chapter 10, 19 to 25
[1548.34 --> 1554.32]  But when Christ came as high priest of the good things
[1554.32 --> 1555.70]  That are now already here
[1555.70 --> 1559.02]  He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1559.02 --> 1561.20]  That is not made with human hands
[1561.20 --> 1562.42]  That is to say
[1562.42 --> 1564.24]  Is not a part of this creation
[1564.24 --> 1569.68]  He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves
[1569.68 --> 1573.06]  But he entered the most holy place once for all
[1573.06 --> 1574.56]  By his own blood
[1574.56 --> 1577.22]  Thus obtaining eternal redemption
[1577.22 --> 1580.98]  The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of heifer
[1580.98 --> 1584.16]  Sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean
[1584.16 --> 1585.42]  Sanctify them
[1585.42 --> 1588.36]  So that they are outwardly clean
[1588.36 --> 1590.70]  How much more then
[1590.70 --> 1592.24]  Will the blood of Christ
[1592.24 --> 1593.80]  Who through the eternal spirit
[1593.80 --> 1596.60]  Offered himself unblemished to God
[1596.60 --> 1598.94]  Cleanse our consciences
[1598.94 --> 1601.00]  From acts that lead to death
[1601.00 --> 1602.98]  So that we may serve
[1602.98 --> 1604.38]  The living God
[1604.38 --> 1608.46]  Therefore brothers and sisters
[1608.46 --> 1612.14]  Since we have confidence to enter the most holy place
[1612.14 --> 1613.20]  By the blood of Jesus
[1613.20 --> 1615.28]  By a new and living way
[1615.28 --> 1617.00]  Opened for us through the curtain
[1617.00 --> 1618.40]  That is his body
[1618.40 --> 1621.00]  And since we have a great high priest
[1621.00 --> 1622.14]  Over the house of God
[1622.14 --> 1625.32]  Let us draw near to God
[1625.32 --> 1626.68]  With a sincere heart
[1626.68 --> 1628.58]  And with a full assurance
[1628.58 --> 1629.84]  That faith brings
[1629.84 --> 1632.08]  Having our hearts sprinkled
[1632.08 --> 1634.38]  To cleanse us from a guilty conscience
[1634.38 --> 1636.96]  And having our bodies washed with pure water
[1636.96 --> 1640.52]  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess
[1640.52 --> 1643.70]  For he who promised is faithful
[1643.70 --> 1648.30]  And let us consider how we may spur one another on
[1648.30 --> 1649.64]  Toward love and good deeds
[1649.64 --> 1651.74]  Not giving up meeting together
[1651.74 --> 1653.60]  As some are in the habit of doing
[1653.60 --> 1655.46]  But encouraging one another
[1655.46 --> 1656.88]  And all the more
[1656.88 --> 1659.22]  As you see the day approaching
[1659.22 --> 1661.74]  This is the word of the Lord
[1661.74 --> 1663.64]  Would you please pray with me?
[1667.00 --> 1668.56]  Father, we want to know you
[1668.56 --> 1670.76]  We want to know your cross
[1670.76 --> 1674.74]  We want to know what you have accomplished for us
[1674.74 --> 1677.54]  So that we may understand it
[1677.54 --> 1678.70]  And understanding it
[1678.70 --> 1680.20]  It would transform us
[1680.20 --> 1682.50]  And set us free
[1682.50 --> 1683.76]  And make us live
[1683.76 --> 1686.90]  More in step with you
[1686.90 --> 1689.22]  More being conformed to your image
[1689.22 --> 1693.00]  More to participate in your mission in this world
[1693.00 --> 1696.06]  So Lord, we ask that you would speak to us now
[1696.06 --> 1697.02]  By your Holy Spirit
[1697.02 --> 1698.26]  We are your servants
[1698.26 --> 1700.86]  And Lord, we draw near to you to listen
[1700.86 --> 1702.32]  We pray in Jesus' name
[1702.32 --> 1702.86]  Amen
[1702.86 --> 1705.70]  So I want to begin this morning
[1705.70 --> 1709.06]  By telling you about a guy named Edward Jenner
[1709.06 --> 1710.98]  I don't know if you know who Edward Jenner is
[1710.98 --> 1714.90]  But he was a very prominent British doctor and surgeon
[1714.90 --> 1719.90]  And he lived around the late 1700s, early 1800s
[1719.90 --> 1722.02]  And what he is most known for
[1722.02 --> 1726.26]  His legacy to medical history
[1726.26 --> 1730.92]  Is that he invented the vaccine for the smallpox virus
[1730.92 --> 1732.42]  That was actually the first vaccine
[1732.42 --> 1735.08]  So he's kind of the father of immunology
[1735.08 --> 1737.10]  So smallpox
[1737.10 --> 1739.14]  Has been
[1739.14 --> 1741.00]  Essentially eradicated
[1741.00 --> 1742.78]  So I don't know if any of you
[1742.78 --> 1744.24]  Have known anybody
[1744.24 --> 1745.54]  Who has had smallpox
[1745.54 --> 1747.44]  But it is a deadly form
[1747.44 --> 1749.44]  Of something that is more
[1749.44 --> 1751.32]  Similar
[1751.32 --> 1753.06]  That is still widespread today
[1753.06 --> 1754.50]  Kind of like the chickenpox
[1754.50 --> 1756.04]  And so in the same way
[1756.04 --> 1758.02]  You get the blisters and the rash
[1758.02 --> 1760.74]  But smallpox also gave you
[1760.74 --> 1761.82]  A deadly fever
[1761.82 --> 1764.32]  And so for children
[1764.32 --> 1765.74]  And for the elderly
[1765.74 --> 1768.22]  It was often a death sentence
[1768.22 --> 1769.72]  If you got smallpox
[1769.72 --> 1773.38]  And in the 1790s
[1773.38 --> 1775.04]  When Jenner started working
[1775.04 --> 1776.52]  On a solution to it
[1776.52 --> 1778.34]  Smallpox claimed about
[1778.34 --> 1780.28]  Half a million lives in Western Europe
[1780.28 --> 1782.46]  So Jenner made it his mission
[1782.46 --> 1784.56]  To find a solution
[1784.56 --> 1786.86]  To solve this plague
[1786.86 --> 1789.80]  So he started going along
[1789.80 --> 1792.54]  This trail of research
[1792.54 --> 1794.06]  He discovered that people
[1794.06 --> 1796.54]  Who grew up on a dairy farm
[1796.54 --> 1799.14]  Or who worked around cows
[1799.14 --> 1801.64]  Would get a form of the pox
[1801.64 --> 1803.24]  From the cows
[1803.24 --> 1805.28]  And it was creatively called
[1805.28 --> 1807.00]  Cowpox
[1807.00 --> 1807.84]  You guessed it
[1807.84 --> 1809.94]  And so with the cowpox
[1809.94 --> 1811.44]  It was the same thing
[1811.44 --> 1812.34]  With the skin rash
[1812.34 --> 1813.26]  And the blisters
[1813.26 --> 1815.84]  But it was far less deadly
[1815.84 --> 1817.44]  And he noticed
[1817.44 --> 1818.34]  That people who lived
[1818.34 --> 1819.70]  And worked on the dairy farms
[1819.70 --> 1822.46]  And who had gotten cowpox
[1822.46 --> 1824.56]  After that experience
[1824.56 --> 1826.16]  They were immune
[1826.16 --> 1828.44]  To the smallpox virus
[1828.44 --> 1830.70]  So Jenner began to ask
[1830.70 --> 1833.48]  Well, what if we were to inject
[1833.48 --> 1835.96]  The cowpox virus
[1835.96 --> 1838.36]  Into perfectly healthy people
[1838.36 --> 1840.46]  But people who don't work
[1840.46 --> 1842.18]  Around cows on the farm
[1842.18 --> 1844.90]  Maybe they too
[1844.90 --> 1847.12]  Could become immune
[1847.12 --> 1849.24]  To the smallpox virus
[1849.24 --> 1851.74]  So I'll show you a photo
[1851.74 --> 1853.42]  Of Edward Jenner
[1853.42 --> 1854.54]  Put it on the screen
[1854.54 --> 1856.60]  And so here he is
[1856.60 --> 1859.34]  Administering the first vaccine
[1859.34 --> 1861.32]  And the first person
[1861.32 --> 1862.56]  To get a cow disease
[1862.56 --> 1864.16]  Injected into them
[1864.16 --> 1865.80]  Was an eight-year-old boy
[1865.80 --> 1867.34]  And it was actually the son
[1867.34 --> 1870.18]  Of Edward Jenner's gardener
[1870.18 --> 1872.24]  Now I find that highly suspicious
[1872.24 --> 1873.58]  I don't know how that happened
[1873.58 --> 1874.58]  If he like lost a bed
[1874.58 --> 1875.02]  Or something
[1875.02 --> 1876.24]  But anyway
[1876.24 --> 1877.38]  This is how history
[1877.38 --> 1878.02]  Has come down
[1878.02 --> 1879.54]  And so he injected
[1879.54 --> 1880.54]  The cowpox
[1880.54 --> 1881.28]  Into this boy
[1881.28 --> 1882.72]  Who got terribly sick
[1882.72 --> 1884.38]  But he got better
[1884.38 --> 1887.78]  Then he never got smallpox
[1887.78 --> 1890.06]  And so Edward Jenner
[1890.06 --> 1892.54]  Began to test it more widely
[1892.54 --> 1893.90]  Including on his own son
[1893.90 --> 1894.40]  Who was, you know
[1894.40 --> 1894.96]  One of the first
[1894.96 --> 1896.08]  Twenty or so people
[1896.08 --> 1900.16]  Who received this vaccine
[1900.16 --> 1902.18]  And he struck gold
[1902.18 --> 1902.96]  Right?
[1903.02 --> 1904.22]  This was a solution
[1904.22 --> 1906.74]  To the smallpox epidemic
[1906.74 --> 1908.74]  And so he published his results
[1908.74 --> 1909.44]  And his research
[1909.44 --> 1911.66]  And he began to administer vaccines
[1911.66 --> 1914.94]  Which is a common practice now
[1914.94 --> 1915.96]  And we are all waiting
[1915.96 --> 1918.32]  For our COVID-19 vaccine
[1918.32 --> 1922.02]  And the reason I'm sharing this with you
[1922.02 --> 1923.40]  Is that this helps us get
[1923.40 --> 1925.64]  Into the world of Hebrews
[1925.64 --> 1928.18]  When we talk about
[1928.18 --> 1929.76]  The cross of Christ
[1929.76 --> 1930.96]  We tend to talk mostly
[1930.96 --> 1932.20]  About Jesus' death
[1932.20 --> 1934.80]  To offer us forgiveness
[1934.80 --> 1935.80]  Right?
[1935.86 --> 1936.76]  And this is central
[1936.76 --> 1938.64]  And it's an important truth
[1938.64 --> 1939.50]  So last week
[1939.50 --> 1941.14]  We looked at Romans chapter 3
[1941.14 --> 1942.20]  And we saw that
[1942.20 --> 1943.08]  The deepest need
[1943.08 --> 1944.98]  That we have as human beings
[1944.98 --> 1947.08]  Is to be forgiven of our sins
[1947.08 --> 1949.02]  And that this is made possible
[1949.02 --> 1950.96]  Because of Jesus' death
[1950.96 --> 1951.50]  On the cross
[1951.50 --> 1952.54]  As a substitute
[1952.54 --> 1955.94]  Whereby we are declared righteous
[1955.94 --> 1957.16]  In God's sight
[1957.16 --> 1958.64]  By his grace
[1958.64 --> 1960.38]  And that this is something
[1960.38 --> 1962.28]  We receive through faith
[1962.28 --> 1964.42]  So this is central
[1964.42 --> 1966.08]  But this morning
[1966.08 --> 1967.28]  I want to highlight
[1967.28 --> 1969.84]  Another aspect of the cross
[1969.84 --> 1970.58]  And it's something
[1970.58 --> 1972.28]  That goes along with that
[1972.28 --> 1973.74]  But it's something
[1973.74 --> 1974.92]  That I think we often
[1974.92 --> 1976.72]  Underemphasize
[1976.72 --> 1978.82]  And this is the idea
[1978.82 --> 1979.58]  Of sin
[1979.58 --> 1983.00]  Not only a debt
[1983.00 --> 1984.36]  That we need to be forgiven
[1984.36 --> 1985.24]  For
[1985.24 --> 1987.24]  But that sin
[1987.24 --> 1989.32]  Makes us unclean
[1989.32 --> 1990.88]  And that we need to
[1990.88 --> 1992.76]  Therefore be cleansed
[1992.76 --> 1993.44]  Okay, we
[1993.44 --> 1993.70]  You know
[1993.70 --> 1994.62]  And we all understand
[1994.62 --> 1995.50]  How dirt
[1995.50 --> 1997.22]  Or mud
[1997.22 --> 1997.96]  Or sweat
[1997.96 --> 1998.94]  It gets on us
[1998.94 --> 2000.00]  And it makes us dirty
[2000.00 --> 2001.08]  On the outside
[2001.08 --> 2002.46]  And so we take a shower
[2002.46 --> 2003.72]  And we can be cleaned off
[2003.72 --> 2005.38]  But sin
[2005.38 --> 2006.64]  The Bible tells us
[2006.64 --> 2007.92]  Makes us dirty
[2007.92 --> 2008.96]  Not on the outside
[2008.96 --> 2010.56]  But on the inside
[2010.56 --> 2012.62]  Because sin is not
[2012.62 --> 2013.34]  A violation
[2013.34 --> 2014.72]  Of God's laws
[2014.72 --> 2016.18]  That needs to be
[2016.18 --> 2017.18]  Forgiven
[2017.18 --> 2017.76]  I mean it is
[2017.76 --> 2018.62]  But not only that
[2018.62 --> 2020.18]  It also is a violation
[2020.18 --> 2022.08]  Of our very selves
[2022.08 --> 2024.16]  As men and women
[2024.16 --> 2025.28]  Made in God's image
[2025.28 --> 2025.72]  And so
[2025.72 --> 2027.28]  We need to be
[2027.28 --> 2027.76]  Cleansed
[2027.76 --> 2029.48]  We need to be
[2029.48 --> 2030.38]  Made whole
[2030.38 --> 2033.08]  Because in the Bible
[2033.08 --> 2034.92]  Sin is talked about
[2034.92 --> 2036.56]  As something that
[2036.56 --> 2037.76]  Stains
[2037.76 --> 2040.34]  Sin corrupts
[2040.34 --> 2041.26]  It defiles
[2041.26 --> 2042.22]  It pollutes
[2042.22 --> 2043.76]  And sin is kind of like
[2043.76 --> 2044.48]  A disease
[2044.48 --> 2045.94]  Inside of you
[2045.94 --> 2047.34]  And it makes you sick
[2047.34 --> 2049.34]  And it leads to death
[2049.34 --> 2050.90]  Much like
[2050.90 --> 2052.44]  The smallpox virus
[2052.44 --> 2054.82]  But the good news
[2054.82 --> 2056.24]  Is that there is
[2056.24 --> 2056.78]  A cure
[2056.78 --> 2058.26]  A remedy
[2058.26 --> 2060.40]  Has been made available
[2060.40 --> 2062.70]  To sick
[2062.70 --> 2064.06]  Sin sick
[2064.06 --> 2064.98]  Diseased
[2064.98 --> 2066.08]  Human beings
[2066.08 --> 2067.64]  That there is a remedy
[2067.64 --> 2068.48]  There is a solution
[2068.48 --> 2069.82]  That is available
[2069.82 --> 2071.44]  And so there are
[2071.44 --> 2072.04]  This morning
[2072.04 --> 2072.56]  Just two
[2072.56 --> 2073.84]  Simple things
[2073.84 --> 2074.90]  I want us to see
[2074.90 --> 2075.76]  From this passage
[2075.76 --> 2076.82]  First
[2076.82 --> 2078.28]  How the cross
[2078.28 --> 2078.90]  Of Jesus
[2078.90 --> 2079.94]  Cleanses us
[2079.94 --> 2081.50]  And then secondly
[2081.50 --> 2082.76]  What is the proper
[2082.76 --> 2083.52]  Response
[2083.52 --> 2084.82]  To what Jesus
[2084.82 --> 2085.72]  Has done
[2085.72 --> 2086.14]  Okay
[2086.14 --> 2086.72]  Those two things
[2086.72 --> 2087.28]  So first
[2087.28 --> 2088.46]  The cleansing
[2088.46 --> 2089.42]  Of the cross
[2089.42 --> 2091.80]  How does the cross
[2091.80 --> 2092.22]  Of Jesus
[2092.22 --> 2093.36]  Cleanse us
[2093.36 --> 2094.66]  From guilt
[2094.66 --> 2095.44]  And sin
[2095.44 --> 2097.00]  And the crux
[2097.00 --> 2097.98]  Of what
[2097.98 --> 2098.82]  I want to
[2098.82 --> 2100.06]  Focus on
[2100.06 --> 2101.14]  In this first point
[2101.14 --> 2102.50]  Is found in
[2102.50 --> 2103.72]  Hebrews chapter 9
[2103.72 --> 2105.16]  Verses 13 to 14
[2105.16 --> 2106.72]  So let's look
[2106.72 --> 2107.62]  Again at
[2107.62 --> 2108.88]  Verses 13 and 14
[2108.88 --> 2109.60]  It says
[2109.60 --> 2110.08]  The blood
[2110.08 --> 2110.10]  The blood
[2110.10 --> 2110.66]  Of goats
[2110.66 --> 2111.28]  And bulls
[2111.28 --> 2111.84]  And the ashes
[2111.84 --> 2113.82]  Of a heifer
[2113.82 --> 2114.90]  Sprinkled on those
[2114.90 --> 2115.78]  Who are ceremonially
[2115.78 --> 2116.40]  Unclean
[2116.40 --> 2117.38]  Sanctify them
[2117.38 --> 2117.84]  So they were
[2117.84 --> 2118.70]  Outwardly clean
[2118.70 --> 2119.32]  Right
[2119.32 --> 2120.16]  So the blood
[2120.16 --> 2121.02]  Would be sprinkled
[2121.02 --> 2122.34]  People would be
[2122.34 --> 2123.10]  Then therefore
[2123.10 --> 2124.48]  Made clean
[2124.48 --> 2125.26]  Ceremonially
[2125.26 --> 2125.92]  That is
[2125.92 --> 2126.76]  In terms of
[2126.76 --> 2127.46]  Being able to
[2127.46 --> 2128.22]  Approach God
[2128.22 --> 2128.90]  And worship him
[2128.90 --> 2130.30]  Then it continues
[2130.30 --> 2131.46]  How much more
[2131.46 --> 2131.84]  Then
[2131.84 --> 2132.82]  Will the blood
[2132.82 --> 2133.42]  Of Christ
[2133.42 --> 2133.84]  Who through
[2133.84 --> 2134.28]  The eternal
[2134.28 --> 2134.68]  Spirit
[2134.68 --> 2135.48]  Offered himself
[2135.48 --> 2136.62]  Unblemished to God
[2136.62 --> 2138.12]  Cleanse our
[2138.12 --> 2139.46]  Consciences
[2139.46 --> 2140.62]  Inside
[2140.62 --> 2141.06]  Right
[2141.06 --> 2142.66]  From acts
[2142.66 --> 2143.52]  That lead to death
[2143.52 --> 2144.64]  So that we may
[2144.64 --> 2145.80]  Serve the living God
[2145.80 --> 2148.30]  So the key word
[2148.30 --> 2149.38]  In these verses
[2149.38 --> 2150.22]  Is the word
[2150.22 --> 2151.22]  Cleanse
[2151.22 --> 2152.00]  Right
[2152.00 --> 2152.58]  And cleanse
[2152.58 --> 2153.24]  Can also be
[2153.24 --> 2154.12]  Translated as
[2154.12 --> 2155.06]  To purify
[2155.06 --> 2156.84]  And it has to do
[2156.84 --> 2158.18]  With pollution
[2158.18 --> 2159.18]  Something that is
[2159.18 --> 2159.56]  Dirty
[2159.56 --> 2160.52]  That is unclean
[2160.52 --> 2162.06]  So for instance
[2162.06 --> 2163.24]  In my boys
[2163.24 --> 2163.78]  Room
[2163.78 --> 2164.58]  At my home
[2164.58 --> 2165.32]  We have an
[2165.32 --> 2166.08]  Air purifier
[2166.08 --> 2167.30]  Now why would
[2167.30 --> 2167.66]  You want to
[2167.66 --> 2168.52]  Purify air
[2168.52 --> 2170.12]  The reason of
[2170.12 --> 2171.20]  Course is that
[2171.20 --> 2172.94]  It's polluted
[2172.94 --> 2173.78]  My son
[2173.78 --> 2174.72]  Abram
[2174.72 --> 2175.50]  Has
[2175.50 --> 2176.50]  Is allergic
[2176.50 --> 2177.14]  To the
[2177.14 --> 2178.04]  Allergens
[2178.04 --> 2178.86]  That get in
[2178.86 --> 2179.32]  The air
[2179.32 --> 2180.70]  And the air
[2180.70 --> 2181.52]  Purifier
[2181.52 --> 2182.42]  Removes
[2182.42 --> 2183.26]  The impurities
[2183.26 --> 2185.82]  And if you
[2185.82 --> 2186.84]  Go on a
[2186.84 --> 2187.74]  Backpacking trip
[2187.74 --> 2188.28]  And you come
[2188.28 --> 2189.08]  To a
[2189.08 --> 2190.08]  Pristine
[2190.08 --> 2190.62]  Mountain
[2190.62 --> 2191.26]  Lake
[2191.26 --> 2192.62]  Or a stream
[2192.62 --> 2193.36]  And the water
[2193.36 --> 2194.28]  Looks so
[2194.28 --> 2194.82]  Clear
[2194.82 --> 2195.38]  And so
[2195.38 --> 2195.90]  Pure
[2195.90 --> 2196.88]  But it's
[2196.88 --> 2197.42]  Actually
[2197.42 --> 2198.90]  Not drinkable
[2198.90 --> 2199.88]  It's polluted
[2199.88 --> 2201.02]  And you need to
[2201.02 --> 2202.00]  Make it clean
[2202.00 --> 2203.00]  With a water
[2203.00 --> 2203.56]  Purifier
[2203.56 --> 2204.74]  And in the same
[2204.74 --> 2205.36]  Way that air
[2205.36 --> 2206.22]  Can be polluted
[2206.22 --> 2206.72]  And water
[2206.72 --> 2207.44]  Can be polluted
[2207.44 --> 2209.26]  We are polluted
[2209.26 --> 2210.18]  By sin
[2210.18 --> 2211.60]  And the idea
[2211.60 --> 2212.38]  Of sin being a
[2212.38 --> 2213.12]  Pollutant in your
[2213.12 --> 2214.44]  Life and in the
[2214.44 --> 2215.06]  Life of God's
[2215.06 --> 2215.96]  People is found
[2215.96 --> 2216.82]  All over in the
[2216.82 --> 2217.10]  Scriptures
[2217.10 --> 2217.86]  But sometimes
[2217.86 --> 2218.36]  I don't think
[2218.36 --> 2218.92]  It's something that
[2218.92 --> 2220.06]  We often think
[2220.06 --> 2220.32]  About
[2220.32 --> 2220.84]  Like when
[2220.84 --> 2221.38]  If I asked
[2221.38 --> 2221.66]  You when's
[2221.66 --> 2222.20]  The last time
[2222.20 --> 2222.62]  You thought
[2222.62 --> 2223.86]  Of sin
[2223.86 --> 2224.96]  As polluting
[2224.96 --> 2225.42]  You
[2225.42 --> 2226.72]  You know
[2226.72 --> 2227.26]  Maybe that's not
[2227.26 --> 2227.68]  Really something
[2227.68 --> 2228.38]  You think of
[2228.38 --> 2230.14]  But the Bible
[2230.14 --> 2231.34]  Refers to sin
[2231.34 --> 2232.40]  As being a
[2232.40 --> 2232.98]  Pollutant
[2232.98 --> 2233.48]  Not just on
[2233.48 --> 2234.26]  The outside
[2234.26 --> 2235.48]  But right
[2235.48 --> 2237.30]  To the core
[2237.30 --> 2239.06]  Of who we are
[2239.06 --> 2240.04]  As people
[2240.04 --> 2241.98]  So sin
[2241.98 --> 2242.98]  Requires then
[2242.98 --> 2243.86]  A ransoming
[2243.86 --> 2245.38]  Or a redeeming
[2245.38 --> 2245.90]  Right
[2245.90 --> 2246.88]  Because we
[2246.88 --> 2247.72]  Need to be
[2247.72 --> 2248.66]  Bought back
[2248.66 --> 2249.12]  Because we
[2249.12 --> 2249.64]  Are slaves
[2249.64 --> 2250.18]  To it
[2250.18 --> 2252.26]  And sin
[2252.26 --> 2252.96]  Requires
[2252.96 --> 2254.08]  Justifying
[2254.08 --> 2254.52]  And being
[2254.52 --> 2254.90]  Declared
[2254.90 --> 2255.42]  Righteous
[2255.42 --> 2256.16]  Because we
[2256.16 --> 2257.04]  Have violated
[2257.04 --> 2257.74]  God's law
[2257.74 --> 2259.20]  But also
[2259.20 --> 2260.08]  It requires
[2260.08 --> 2261.16]  Purification
[2261.16 --> 2262.68]  Because we
[2262.68 --> 2263.42]  Are unclean
[2263.42 --> 2264.90]  And a
[2264.90 --> 2265.88]  Theological word
[2265.88 --> 2266.56]  That is often
[2266.56 --> 2267.14]  Used for this
[2267.14 --> 2267.46]  Is called
[2267.46 --> 2268.34]  Expiation
[2268.34 --> 2270.02]  And so
[2270.02 --> 2270.60]  For ancient
[2270.60 --> 2271.16]  Israel
[2271.16 --> 2271.68]  Blood
[2271.68 --> 2273.26]  Was seen
[2273.26 --> 2274.30]  As one of
[2274.30 --> 2274.84]  Those most
[2274.84 --> 2275.60]  Powerful
[2275.60 --> 2276.28]  Cleansing
[2276.28 --> 2276.96]  Agents
[2276.96 --> 2277.80]  Of all
[2277.80 --> 2278.64]  We're trying
[2278.64 --> 2279.00]  To you know
[2279.00 --> 2279.58]  Clean our
[2279.58 --> 2280.04]  Bathroom
[2280.04 --> 2280.30]  And we
[2280.30 --> 2280.70]  Might look
[2280.70 --> 2281.02]  Online
[2281.02 --> 2281.50]  Like what's
[2281.50 --> 2282.08]  The best
[2282.08 --> 2283.10]  Most powerful
[2283.10 --> 2283.94]  Cleaner
[2283.94 --> 2284.48]  We can get
[2284.48 --> 2285.96]  Hopefully your
[2285.96 --> 2286.60]  Bathroom's not
[2286.60 --> 2287.56]  Quite that dirty
[2287.56 --> 2288.00]  But you know
[2288.00 --> 2288.30]  What I mean
[2288.30 --> 2288.72]  Like we look
[2288.72 --> 2289.24]  For the best
[2289.24 --> 2289.82]  Most effective
[2289.82 --> 2290.26]  Cleaner
[2290.26 --> 2291.64]  For Israel
[2291.64 --> 2292.54]  The blood
[2292.54 --> 2293.40]  Of Christ
[2293.40 --> 2294.58]  Was the
[2294.58 --> 2295.72]  Most effective
[2295.72 --> 2296.90]  Cleanser
[2296.90 --> 2297.56]  Of sin
[2297.56 --> 2298.96]  It was used
[2298.96 --> 2299.58]  In all of
[2299.58 --> 2300.16]  The important
[2300.16 --> 2300.64]  Cleansing
[2300.64 --> 2301.40]  Rituals
[2301.40 --> 2302.38]  That they had
[2302.38 --> 2303.62]  And in
[2303.62 --> 2304.36]  This passage
[2304.36 --> 2305.10]  When the writer
[2305.10 --> 2305.60]  Of Hebrews
[2305.60 --> 2306.30]  Talks about
[2306.30 --> 2307.28]  Jesus as a
[2307.28 --> 2308.20]  High priest
[2308.20 --> 2309.26]  Entering
[2309.26 --> 2309.76]  Into the
[2309.76 --> 2310.24]  Most holy
[2310.24 --> 2310.76]  Place
[2310.76 --> 2311.36]  He's talking
[2311.36 --> 2311.88]  About
[2311.88 --> 2313.22]  Yom Kippur
[2313.22 --> 2313.72]  The day
[2313.72 --> 2314.40]  Of atonement
[2314.40 --> 2316.14]  And what
[2316.14 --> 2316.68]  Happens on
[2316.68 --> 2317.42]  That day
[2317.42 --> 2318.66]  Though has
[2318.66 --> 2319.42]  Been totally
[2319.42 --> 2320.76]  Transformed
[2320.76 --> 2322.02]  By verse
[2322.02 --> 2322.54]  14
[2322.54 --> 2323.82]  Because verse
[2323.82 --> 2324.76]  14 again
[2324.76 --> 2325.14]  Says
[2325.14 --> 2325.62]  How much
[2325.62 --> 2326.18]  More than
[2326.18 --> 2326.48]  Will the
[2326.48 --> 2326.84]  Blood of
[2326.84 --> 2327.30]  Christ
[2327.30 --> 2327.92]  Who through
[2327.92 --> 2328.34]  The eternal
[2328.34 --> 2328.76]  Spirit
[2328.76 --> 2329.66]  Offered himself
[2329.66 --> 2330.46]  Unblemished to
[2330.46 --> 2330.80]  God
[2330.80 --> 2332.36]  Right
[2332.36 --> 2332.80]  And so the
[2332.80 --> 2333.52]  Central part
[2333.52 --> 2334.22]  Of the argument
[2334.22 --> 2334.94]  Here is that
[2334.94 --> 2335.66]  Because Jesus
[2335.66 --> 2337.62]  Offered himself
[2337.62 --> 2339.34]  No more
[2339.34 --> 2340.14]  Sacrifices
[2340.14 --> 2340.54]  Need to be
[2340.54 --> 2340.72]  Done
[2340.72 --> 2341.16]  No more
[2341.16 --> 2341.54]  Blood
[2341.54 --> 2342.00]  Needs to
[2342.00 --> 2342.42]  Be
[2342.42 --> 2343.52]  Shed
[2343.52 --> 2344.74]  Those
[2344.74 --> 2345.52]  Who were
[2345.52 --> 2346.16]  Cleansed
[2346.16 --> 2346.50]  By the
[2346.50 --> 2346.78]  Blood
[2346.78 --> 2347.44]  Of Jesus
[2347.44 --> 2348.40]  And not
[2348.40 --> 2348.96]  By the
[2348.96 --> 2349.20]  Blood
[2349.20 --> 2349.72]  Of goats
[2349.72 --> 2350.48]  And bulls
[2350.48 --> 2351.36]  Are now
[2351.36 --> 2352.74]  Completely
[2352.74 --> 2354.44]  Cleansed
[2354.44 --> 2355.20]  Outside
[2355.20 --> 2356.10]  And inside
[2356.10 --> 2357.84]  And what's
[2357.84 --> 2358.24]  Interesting
[2358.24 --> 2359.46]  Is this
[2359.46 --> 2360.00]  Word he
[2360.00 --> 2360.54]  Uses
[2360.54 --> 2361.10]  In this
[2361.10 --> 2361.50]  Passage
[2361.50 --> 2361.88]  He says
[2361.88 --> 2362.56]  To cleanse
[2362.56 --> 2363.58]  Our
[2363.58 --> 2364.72]  Consciences
[2364.72 --> 2366.36]  So you
[2366.36 --> 2366.88]  Know what
[2366.88 --> 2367.42]  A conscience
[2367.42 --> 2367.84]  Is
[2367.84 --> 2368.04]  You know
[2368.04 --> 2368.50]  A conscience
[2368.50 --> 2369.26]  Is kind
[2369.26 --> 2369.50]  Of like
[2369.50 --> 2370.08]  A moral
[2370.08 --> 2370.62]  Map
[2370.62 --> 2371.72]  That we
[2371.72 --> 2372.48]  Have in
[2372.48 --> 2372.76]  Us
[2372.76 --> 2373.38]  And it
[2373.38 --> 2374.36]  Helps
[2374.36 --> 2374.76]  Us
[2374.76 --> 2376.24]  Determine
[2376.24 --> 2377.44]  Discern
[2377.44 --> 2377.84]  What is
[2377.84 --> 2378.10]  Right
[2378.10 --> 2378.56]  And wrong
[2378.56 --> 2380.02]  And the
[2380.02 --> 2380.56]  Blood of
[2380.56 --> 2380.90]  Jesus
[2380.90 --> 2381.50]  Is so
[2381.50 --> 2382.24]  Powerful
[2382.24 --> 2382.58]  That it
[2382.58 --> 2382.86]  Doesn't
[2382.86 --> 2383.70]  Just purify
[2383.70 --> 2384.08]  You on
[2384.08 --> 2384.96]  The outside
[2384.96 --> 2386.08]  So that
[2386.08 --> 2386.34]  You are
[2386.34 --> 2386.94]  Outwardly
[2386.94 --> 2387.32]  Clean
[2387.32 --> 2388.98]  But something
[2388.98 --> 2390.12]  Deep
[2390.12 --> 2391.04]  Happens
[2391.04 --> 2391.60]  In you
[2391.60 --> 2391.92]  So that
[2391.92 --> 2392.26]  At the
[2392.26 --> 2392.54]  Core
[2392.54 --> 2392.96]  Of who
[2392.96 --> 2393.50]  You are
[2393.50 --> 2393.66]  You're
[2393.66 --> 2394.20]  Not only
[2394.20 --> 2395.42]  Forgiven
[2395.42 --> 2396.04]  You're not
[2396.04 --> 2396.56]  Only declared
[2396.56 --> 2397.10]  Righteous
[2397.10 --> 2397.60]  But you
[2397.60 --> 2398.50]  Are actually
[2398.50 --> 2399.78]  Purified
[2399.78 --> 2401.02]  The stain
[2401.02 --> 2401.84]  Of sin
[2401.84 --> 2403.50]  Is scrubbed
[2403.50 --> 2403.86]  Away
[2403.86 --> 2404.26]  It is
[2404.26 --> 2405.26]  Removed
[2405.26 --> 2406.02]  You are
[2406.02 --> 2406.40]  Clean
[2406.40 --> 2407.98]  It's
[2407.98 --> 2408.38]  Cleaning
[2408.38 --> 2409.46]  Is internal
[2409.46 --> 2409.94]  Right
[2409.94 --> 2410.58]  It's removing
[2410.58 --> 2411.14]  The sin
[2411.14 --> 2411.84]  That no one
[2411.84 --> 2412.36]  Else can
[2412.36 --> 2412.86]  See but
[2412.86 --> 2413.18]  God
[2413.18 --> 2416.08]  So now
[2416.08 --> 2416.72]  When we read
[2416.72 --> 2417.56]  The Old Testament
[2417.56 --> 2419.24]  And we read
[2419.24 --> 2419.70]  About the
[2419.70 --> 2420.60]  Purity laws
[2420.60 --> 2421.40]  And Leviticus
[2421.40 --> 2421.86]  And all this
[2421.86 --> 2422.18]  Stuff
[2422.18 --> 2423.26]  The disease
[2423.26 --> 2423.92]  That is often
[2423.92 --> 2424.54]  Used as a
[2424.54 --> 2425.44]  Picture of our
[2425.44 --> 2426.18]  Relationship
[2426.18 --> 2426.92]  With God
[2426.92 --> 2428.48]  Is the
[2428.48 --> 2428.96]  Disease of
[2428.96 --> 2429.54]  Leprosy
[2429.54 --> 2430.56]  And so you
[2430.56 --> 2430.98]  Read about
[2430.98 --> 2431.64]  All of these
[2431.64 --> 2432.24]  You know
[2432.24 --> 2433.92]  Purity laws
[2433.92 --> 2434.76]  Having to do
[2434.76 --> 2435.68]  With lepers
[2435.68 --> 2437.34]  Now the
[2437.34 --> 2438.34]  Issue is
[2438.34 --> 2439.12]  Like with
[2439.12 --> 2439.90]  Other diseases
[2439.90 --> 2440.28]  That are
[2440.28 --> 2440.96]  Contagious
[2440.96 --> 2441.34]  If you
[2441.34 --> 2441.90]  You had to
[2441.90 --> 2442.58]  Stay away
[2442.58 --> 2443.14]  From people
[2443.14 --> 2443.64]  If you were
[2443.64 --> 2444.12]  A leper
[2444.12 --> 2445.24]  Right
[2445.24 --> 2445.66]  Because you
[2445.66 --> 2446.00]  Don't want
[2446.00 --> 2446.40]  To infect
[2446.40 --> 2446.96]  Other people
[2446.96 --> 2447.52]  So lepers
[2447.52 --> 2447.86]  Had to
[2447.86 --> 2448.34]  Live outside
[2448.34 --> 2448.96]  The community
[2448.96 --> 2449.60]  They had to
[2449.60 --> 2450.18]  Be socially
[2450.18 --> 2450.84]  Isolated
[2450.84 --> 2451.12]  We all
[2451.12 --> 2451.32]  Kind of
[2451.32 --> 2451.56]  Know what
[2451.56 --> 2451.88]  This is
[2451.88 --> 2452.14]  Now
[2452.14 --> 2452.44]  We're all
[2452.44 --> 2452.72]  Kind of
[2452.72 --> 2453.36]  COVID lepers
[2453.36 --> 2454.54]  Stay away
[2454.54 --> 2455.12]  From everyone
[2455.12 --> 2457.18]  But that
[2457.18 --> 2457.60]  Was the
[2457.60 --> 2458.04]  Reality
[2458.04 --> 2458.48]  Is because
[2458.48 --> 2458.68]  It was
[2458.68 --> 2459.30]  Contagious
[2459.30 --> 2460.46]  But not
[2460.46 --> 2461.14]  Only that
[2461.14 --> 2461.86]  For lepers
[2461.86 --> 2462.20]  There was
[2462.20 --> 2463.46]  Another reality
[2463.46 --> 2464.46]  In that
[2464.46 --> 2464.74]  They were
[2464.74 --> 2465.12]  Also
[2465.12 --> 2466.00]  Ceremonially
[2466.00 --> 2466.78]  Unclean
[2466.78 --> 2468.04]  Meaning
[2468.04 --> 2468.46]  They were
[2468.46 --> 2469.12]  Not allowed
[2469.12 --> 2469.44]  To go
[2469.44 --> 2469.72]  To the
[2469.72 --> 2470.04]  Temple
[2470.04 --> 2470.90]  To worship
[2470.90 --> 2471.46]  God
[2471.46 --> 2472.28]  Okay
[2472.28 --> 2472.72]  Maybe we
[2472.72 --> 2473.20]  Can also
[2473.20 --> 2474.70]  You know
[2474.70 --> 2475.14]  Kind of
[2475.14 --> 2475.90]  Experience that
[2475.90 --> 2476.46]  We can't
[2476.46 --> 2476.72]  Come to
[2476.72 --> 2476.98]  Church
[2476.98 --> 2477.20]  Right
[2477.20 --> 2477.46]  Now
[2477.46 --> 2478.64]  But for
[2478.64 --> 2479.12]  The lepers
[2479.12 --> 2479.60]  Like you
[2479.60 --> 2480.42]  Were barred
[2480.42 --> 2480.94]  From worship
[2480.94 --> 2481.52]  And we all
[2481.52 --> 2482.02]  Feel that
[2482.02 --> 2482.72]  Deeply now
[2482.72 --> 2483.16]  That we
[2483.16 --> 2484.10]  Long to be
[2484.10 --> 2484.68]  In God's
[2484.68 --> 2485.48]  Place
[2485.48 --> 2485.80]  And to
[2485.80 --> 2486.40]  Worship him
[2486.40 --> 2488.10]  And now
[2488.10 --> 2488.42]  Imagine
[2488.42 --> 2488.86]  Just because
[2488.86 --> 2489.12]  Of your
[2489.12 --> 2489.46]  Sin
[2489.46 --> 2489.66]  That you
[2489.66 --> 2490.36]  Could never
[2490.36 --> 2490.80]  Come into
[2490.80 --> 2491.34]  The church
[2491.34 --> 2493.20]  Because you
[2493.20 --> 2493.98]  Were unclean
[2493.98 --> 2496.14]  But now
[2496.14 --> 2496.58]  Think about
[2496.58 --> 2497.16]  Jesus
[2497.16 --> 2498.94]  Think about
[2498.94 --> 2499.70]  How Jesus
[2499.70 --> 2500.84]  When we read
[2500.84 --> 2501.48]  About him
[2501.48 --> 2501.68]  In the
[2501.68 --> 2502.10]  Gospels
[2502.10 --> 2502.46]  How he
[2502.46 --> 2503.20]  Interacted
[2503.20 --> 2503.56]  With
[2503.56 --> 2504.82]  The lepers
[2504.82 --> 2505.60]  Right
[2505.60 --> 2506.12]  So if
[2506.12 --> 2506.74]  I
[2506.74 --> 2507.86]  Was walking
[2507.86 --> 2508.16]  Down the
[2508.16 --> 2508.38]  Street
[2508.38 --> 2508.74]  And I
[2508.74 --> 2509.30]  Saw a
[2509.30 --> 2509.66]  Leper
[2509.66 --> 2510.86]  I would
[2510.86 --> 2511.50]  Probably
[2511.50 --> 2512.38]  Very
[2512.38 --> 2512.92]  Quickly
[2512.92 --> 2513.54]  Turn around
[2513.54 --> 2513.86]  And walk
[2513.86 --> 2514.16]  The other
[2514.16 --> 2514.36]  Way
[2514.36 --> 2514.60]  You know
[2514.60 --> 2514.88]  I'm not
[2514.88 --> 2515.26]  Proud of
[2515.26 --> 2515.48]  That
[2515.48 --> 2515.82]  I don't
[2515.82 --> 2516.04]  Know what
[2516.04 --> 2516.18]  You
[2516.18 --> 2516.32]  Would
[2516.32 --> 2516.58]  Do
[2516.58 --> 2517.40]  But I
[2517.40 --> 2517.50]  Would
[2517.50 --> 2517.88]  Probably
[2517.88 --> 2518.34]  Be kind
[2518.34 --> 2518.72]  Of scared
[2518.72 --> 2519.46]  I'd
[2519.46 --> 2519.78]  Probably
[2519.78 --> 2520.36]  At least
[2520.36 --> 2520.60]  Go to
[2520.60 --> 2520.82]  The other
[2520.82 --> 2521.20]  Side of
[2521.20 --> 2521.48]  You know
[2521.48 --> 2521.76]  The other
[2521.76 --> 2522.18]  Sidewalk
[2522.18 --> 2523.78]  But when
[2523.78 --> 2524.18]  We look
[2524.18 --> 2524.68]  At Jesus
[2524.68 --> 2525.00]  In the
[2525.00 --> 2525.40]  Gospels
[2525.40 --> 2525.84]  We see
[2525.84 --> 2526.66]  This upside
[2526.66 --> 2527.08]  Down
[2527.08 --> 2527.74]  Power
[2527.74 --> 2528.54]  Of what
[2528.54 --> 2528.96]  Happens
[2528.96 --> 2529.52]  When Jesus
[2529.52 --> 2530.42]  Encounters
[2530.42 --> 2531.88]  Uncleanliness
[2531.88 --> 2533.16]  Rather
[2533.16 --> 2534.66]  Than walking
[2534.66 --> 2535.46]  Away from
[2535.46 --> 2536.12]  These people
[2536.12 --> 2537.02]  With leprosy
[2537.02 --> 2538.28]  And rather
[2538.28 --> 2538.76]  Than just
[2538.76 --> 2539.58]  Like healing
[2539.58 --> 2540.04]  Them from
[2540.04 --> 2540.56]  A distance
[2540.56 --> 2540.88]  And like
[2540.88 --> 2541.12]  Jesus
[2541.12 --> 2541.76]  Saying like
[2541.76 --> 2542.30]  Hey you
[2542.30 --> 2542.82]  Over there
[2542.82 --> 2543.28]  Like be
[2543.28 --> 2543.66]  He healed
[2543.66 --> 2544.66]  He doesn't
[2544.66 --> 2545.16]  Do that
[2545.16 --> 2546.14]  What does
[2546.14 --> 2546.70]  He do
[2546.70 --> 2548.14]  Jesus
[2548.14 --> 2549.00]  Actually
[2549.00 --> 2550.16]  Goes toward
[2550.16 --> 2550.56]  Them
[2550.56 --> 2551.56]  And
[2551.56 --> 2552.84]  He touches
[2552.84 --> 2553.18]  Them
[2553.18 --> 2554.70]  He embraces
[2554.70 --> 2555.56]  Them
[2555.56 --> 2557.50]  And
[2557.50 --> 2558.46]  Rather
[2558.46 --> 2558.98]  Now
[2558.98 --> 2559.38]  Than
[2559.38 --> 2559.90]  Their
[2559.90 --> 2560.68]  Sickness
[2560.68 --> 2560.88]  Their
[2560.88 --> 2561.94]  Uncleanliness
[2561.94 --> 2563.42]  Transferring
[2563.42 --> 2564.10]  To Jesus
[2564.10 --> 2565.50]  What actually
[2565.50 --> 2566.18]  Happens
[2566.18 --> 2567.80]  Actually
[2567.80 --> 2568.26]  It's
[2568.26 --> 2568.88]  Jesus
[2568.88 --> 2569.96]  Purity
[2569.96 --> 2570.86]  His
[2570.86 --> 2571.50]  Cleanliness
[2571.50 --> 2571.76]  His
[2571.76 --> 2572.10]  Health
[2572.10 --> 2572.28]  His
[2572.28 --> 2572.98]  Perfection
[2572.98 --> 2573.44]  His
[2573.44 --> 2574.02]  Healing
[2574.02 --> 2574.96]  Flows
[2574.96 --> 2575.16]  To
[2575.16 --> 2575.48]  Them
[2575.48 --> 2577.90]  And
[2577.90 --> 2578.04]  They
[2578.04 --> 2578.34]  Become
[2578.34 --> 2578.74]  Clean
[2578.74 --> 2580.48]  See
[2580.48 --> 2581.46]  It's
[2581.46 --> 2581.60]  Not
[2581.60 --> 2581.76]  That
[2581.76 --> 2582.00]  Our
[2582.00 --> 2582.40]  Sin
[2582.40 --> 2582.72]  Gets
[2582.72 --> 2583.32]  Transferred
[2583.32 --> 2583.60]  To
[2583.60 --> 2584.30]  Jesus
[2584.30 --> 2584.56]  I
[2584.56 --> 2584.64]  Mean
[2584.64 --> 2584.78]  He
[2584.78 --> 2585.04]  Takes
[2585.04 --> 2585.18]  On
[2585.18 --> 2585.28]  The
[2585.28 --> 2585.48]  Cross
[2585.48 --> 2585.66]  That's
[2585.66 --> 2585.90]  Another
[2585.90 --> 2586.14]  Thing
[2586.14 --> 2586.24]  We
[2586.24 --> 2586.48]  Talked
[2586.48 --> 2586.68]  About
[2586.68 --> 2587.44]  But
[2587.44 --> 2587.56]  In
[2587.56 --> 2587.74]  This
[2587.74 --> 2588.50]  Talking
[2588.50 --> 2588.70]  About
[2588.70 --> 2589.36]  Cleanliness
[2589.36 --> 2589.58]  In
[2589.58 --> 2589.74]  This
[2589.74 --> 2590.16]  Realm
[2590.16 --> 2590.34]  Of
[2590.34 --> 2590.80]  Reality
[2590.80 --> 2592.18]  Our
[2592.18 --> 2593.10]  Uncleanness
[2593.10 --> 2593.58]  Doesn't
[2593.58 --> 2593.98]  Pollute
[2593.98 --> 2594.30]  Jesus
[2594.30 --> 2594.76]  His
[2594.76 --> 2595.32]  Purity
[2595.32 --> 2595.64]  His
[2595.64 --> 2596.18]  Holiness
[2596.18 --> 2597.02]  Cleanses
[2597.02 --> 2597.36]  Us
[2597.36 --> 2598.10]  Because
[2598.10 --> 2598.28]  He
[2598.28 --> 2598.60]  Is
[2598.60 --> 2598.76]  The
[2598.76 --> 2599.14]  Final
[2599.14 --> 2600.30]  Sacrifice
[2600.30 --> 2600.54]  His
[2600.54 --> 2600.92]  Blood
[2600.92 --> 2601.22]  Was
[2601.22 --> 2601.60]  Shed
[2601.60 --> 2601.82]  And
[2601.82 --> 2601.94]  It
[2601.94 --> 2602.28]  Cleanses
[2602.28 --> 2602.58]  Us
[2602.58 --> 2603.00]  Now
[2603.00 --> 2603.16]  We
[2603.16 --> 2603.40]  Ask
[2603.40 --> 2603.56]  Well
[2603.56 --> 2603.78]  Why
[2603.78 --> 2603.94]  Is
[2603.94 --> 2604.08]  This
[2604.08 --> 2604.54]  Important
[2604.54 --> 2605.40]  Right
[2605.40 --> 2605.68]  Why
[2605.68 --> 2606.04]  Is
[2606.04 --> 2606.18]  This
[2606.18 --> 2606.40]  Good
[2606.40 --> 2606.72]  News
[2606.72 --> 2607.32]  And
[2607.32 --> 2607.46]  This
[2607.46 --> 2607.56]  Is
[2607.56 --> 2607.70]  Why
[2607.70 --> 2607.82]  It's
[2607.82 --> 2608.00]  Good
[2608.00 --> 2608.30]  News
[2608.30 --> 2609.86]  Because
[2609.86 --> 2610.18]  We
[2610.18 --> 2610.34]  Are
[2610.34 --> 2610.82]  Unclean
[2610.82 --> 2611.94]  Right
[2611.94 --> 2612.18]  I
[2612.18 --> 2612.58]  Know
[2612.58 --> 2612.92]  That
[2612.92 --> 2613.18]  There
[2613.18 --> 2613.34]  Are
[2613.34 --> 2613.70]  Things
[2613.70 --> 2613.90]  That
[2613.90 --> 2614.08]  You
[2614.08 --> 2614.32]  Have
[2614.32 --> 2614.68]  Done
[2614.68 --> 2615.68]  There
[2615.68 --> 2615.86]  Are
[2615.86 --> 2616.28]  Things
[2616.28 --> 2616.48]  That
[2616.48 --> 2616.72]  You
[2616.72 --> 2617.16]  Have
[2617.16 --> 2617.84]  Said
[2617.84 --> 2618.56]  There
[2618.56 --> 2618.66]  Are
[2618.66 --> 2618.82]  Things
[2618.82 --> 2618.94]  That
[2618.94 --> 2619.02]  You
[2619.02 --> 2619.16]  Have
[2619.16 --> 2619.56]  Thought
[2619.56 --> 2621.48]  That
[2621.48 --> 2621.78]  When
[2621.78 --> 2622.00]  It
[2622.00 --> 2622.42]  Comes
[2622.42 --> 2622.66]  To
[2622.66 --> 2622.88]  Your
[2622.88 --> 2623.80]  Conscience
[2623.80 --> 2624.76]  You
[2624.76 --> 2625.40]  Feel
[2625.40 --> 2626.48]  Polluted
[2626.48 --> 2628.28]  That
[2628.28 --> 2628.36]  Is
[2628.36 --> 2628.52]  True
[2628.52 --> 2628.66]  Of
[2628.66 --> 2628.86]  Every
[2628.86 --> 2629.14]  Single
[2629.14 --> 2629.38]  One
[2629.38 --> 2629.52]  Of
[2629.52 --> 2629.70]  You
[2629.70 --> 2629.98]  And
[2629.98 --> 2630.10]  It
[2630.10 --> 2630.26]  Is
[2630.26 --> 2630.52]  True
[2630.52 --> 2630.72]  Of
[2630.72 --> 2630.90]  Me
[2630.90 --> 2631.08]  As
[2631.08 --> 2631.30]  Well
[2631.30 --> 2631.92]  That
[2631.92 --> 2632.08]  There
[2632.08 --> 2632.26]  Are
[2632.26 --> 2632.58]  Things
[2632.58 --> 2632.72]  That
[2632.72 --> 2632.86]  When
[2632.86 --> 2633.00]  You
[2633.00 --> 2633.38]  Think
[2633.38 --> 2634.32]  Of
[2634.32 --> 2634.62]  Maybe
[2634.62 --> 2634.88]  Having
[2634.88 --> 2635.16]  To
[2635.16 --> 2635.72]  Speak
[2635.72 --> 2636.26]  Of
[2636.26 --> 2636.50]  Them
[2636.50 --> 2637.80]  You
[2637.80 --> 2638.28]  Shrink
[2638.28 --> 2638.64]  Back
[2638.64 --> 2638.86]  In
[2638.86 --> 2639.18]  Shame
[2639.18 --> 2640.00]  Like
[2640.00 --> 2640.28]  Even

[3824.12 --> 3824.52]  Jesus

[3824.84 --> 3824.90]  Via
[3824.90 --> 3825.50]  Just
[3825.50 --> 3829.46]  Ar
[3829.46 --> 3829.48]  Lives
[3829.48 --> 3829.56]  Green
[3829.56 --> 3829.94] 讓
[3829.94 --> 3830.06]  Join
[3830.06 --> 3830.14]  Besie
[3830.14 --> 3830.94]  Love
[3830.94 --> 3831.30]  wife
[3831.30 --> 3833.54]  She
[3833.54 --> 3834.84]  John
[3834.84 --> 3835.40]  umm
[3835.40 --> 3835.74]  Take on
[3835.74 --> 3835.98]  Jammer
[3835.98 --> 3836.68]  Beau
[3836.68 --> 3837.18]  4
[3837.18 --> 3837.90]  D
[3837.90 --> 3838.92]  footsteps
[3838.92 --> 3839.68]  Maui
[3839.68 --> 3840.44]  E
[3840.44 --> 3841.02]  guitar
[3841.02 --> 3841.44]  Impulse
[3841.44 --> 3842.04]  And
[3842.04 --> 3843.98]  the
[3843.98 --> 3868.98]  Be true, our God, forever and ever
[3868.98 --> 3888.98]  Be true, our God, forever and ever
[3888.98 --> 3899.04]  So I want to do something a little bit different today with our community prayer.
[3901.00 --> 3908.18]  We will pray a bit, but also before that, briefly, I would like to recite the Lord's Prayer together first.
[3909.18 --> 3916.80]  And so I'm going to also read it somewhat slowly, so that as we read it together, you can think about what the words are saying.
[3916.80 --> 3924.20]  Because, you know, it's such a familiar prayer to us, they're such familiar words that sometimes we say it mechanically.
[3925.12 --> 3926.68]  So let's not do that now.
[3927.40 --> 3929.30]  We're going to say it slowly together.
[3929.40 --> 3931.44]  And as we do, pray over each phrase.
[3931.78 --> 3932.44]  Think about them.
[3932.86 --> 3935.58]  So we'll have the words here on the screen.
[3935.86 --> 3940.58]  And would you join me now in the Lord's Prayer?
[3940.58 --> 3949.96]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[3951.72 --> 3960.78]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[3960.78 --> 3966.00]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[3967.00 --> 3974.24]  And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
[3975.46 --> 3984.14]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[3984.14 --> 3993.38]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[3994.70 --> 3995.34]  Amen.
[3997.42 --> 4000.76]  Jesus, you long to be with us.
[4001.92 --> 4004.30]  You long for us to draw near to you.
[4005.04 --> 4010.22]  You long for us to be united with you and with one another as your body.
[4010.22 --> 4015.60]  So, Lord, we ask that you would enable us to boldly approach your throne of grace.
[4016.28 --> 4019.42]  And we ask that you would bind us to one another in Christ.
[4021.40 --> 4024.36]  And, Father, in our daily life, we suffer illness.
[4025.10 --> 4026.88]  We suffer death and loss.
[4027.74 --> 4030.04]  We suffer the challenge of relationships.
[4031.52 --> 4034.02]  Father, we suffer loneliness and loss of hope.
[4034.02 --> 4040.72]  So, Father, we trust that you know and you see each one of us.
[4040.84 --> 4042.48]  And that you are there with us.
[4043.02 --> 4046.58]  And that your sovereign hand is our guide and our help.
[4047.82 --> 4052.30]  We pray that you would encourage our hearts this morning and each day.
[4052.92 --> 4055.42]  And that you would dwell with us by your Holy Spirit,
[4055.96 --> 4059.12]  who is our comforter, our counselor, and our helper.
[4060.50 --> 4063.08]  We pray all of these things in Jesus' name.
[4064.02 --> 4064.46]  Amen.
[4066.26 --> 4070.50]  And also, as we come to the end of our worship service,
[4070.72 --> 4074.26]  I also want to do something also a bit different with a benediction.
[4074.86 --> 4075.98]  It's going to be responsive.
[4076.18 --> 4077.28]  And we'll have the words on the screen.
[4077.40 --> 4080.44]  And this I took from the Daily Prayer Project,
[4080.60 --> 4084.00]  which is our prayer and Bible reading guide that a lot of us use.
[4084.46 --> 4086.26]  It comes from the Anglican Church in Kenya.
[4087.68 --> 4089.94]  So, say the words that are both together.
[4090.02 --> 4093.50]  At the same time, you may stand wherever you are and hold out your hands.
[4094.02 --> 4096.12]  And so, here's God's blessing.
[4096.12 --> 4101.10]  All our problems we send to the cross of Christ.
[4101.60 --> 4106.14]  All our difficulties we send to the cross of Christ.
[4106.14 --> 4111.16]  All the devil's works we send to the cross of Christ.
[4111.90 --> 4116.62]  All our hopes we set on the risen Christ.
[4118.30 --> 4120.68]  Christ, the Son of Righteousness, shine upon you
[4120.68 --> 4123.10]  and scatter the darkness from before your path.
[4123.58 --> 4127.16]  And the blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[4127.68 --> 4130.52]  be among you and remain with you always.
[4131.18 --> 4131.50]  Amen.
[4131.50 --> 4131.54]  Amen.
[4139.58 --> 4140.46]  Amen.
[4140.46 --> 4141.46]  Amen.
[4170.46 --> 4172.46]  Amen.
[4200.46 --> 4202.46]  Amen.
[4230.46 --> 4232.46]  Amen.
[4260.46 --> 4262.46]  Amen.
[4290.46 --> 4292.46]  Amen.
[4320.46 --> 4322.46]  Amen.
