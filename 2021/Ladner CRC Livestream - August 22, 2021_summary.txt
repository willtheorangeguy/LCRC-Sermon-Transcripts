• The mark of a Christian is joy, and following Jesus should result in a life marked by joy.
• Christians are often misunderstood as being dour or judgmental, but mature Christians can be humble, kind, and joyful.
• Joy is not just an emotion, but a deep and settled pattern of life that comes from knowing God's promises and relying on Him.
• The Bible teaches that joy is one of the fruits of the Spirit, and Christians grow in joy over time with the help of the Holy Spirit.
• There are different types of joy, including momentary highs of emotion and a deeper, settled joy that remains regardless of circumstances.
• Joy is nurtured through remembrance of past experiences and God's works
• Experience of joy in the present can be drawn from and built upon joy remembered
• One way to experience joy is to remember the works of God in the past
• Reading the Bible is essential to remembering God's past acts of deliverance
• Remembering moments when God showed up in one's life is also important for experiencing joy
• The importance of remembering joy from God's past acts and experiences
• Joy is nurtured by living in a history of God's work and actions
• The psalmist uses metaphors to describe the experience of joy: sudden interruption (restoring fortunes like streams) and slow growth (sowing seeds with tears)
• The promise that sorrow is temporary, giving way to permanent joy
• Joy can be experienced both in this life and in the future, in the new creation
• Following Jesus brings hope for the future
• Joy is cultivated through remembering what God has done (memory) and anticipating what God will do (hope)
• Focusing on the past can prevent experiencing joy in the present if it becomes an idol or distracts from current blessings
• Focusing too much on the future can bring anxiety and uncertainty, preventing joy in the present
• Recognizing God's faithfulness in all seasons of life is key to experiencing joy
• Being centered on oneself rather than on God can prevent joy
• God's restoration (turning from judgment to favor) is a language of salvation, redemption, and a past, present, and future reality.
