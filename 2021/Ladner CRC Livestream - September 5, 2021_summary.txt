• The psalm and its themes will be analyzed from two stanzas, with two main points drawn for practical application in following Jesus.
• Psalm 129 is discussed as an example of God's children being oppressed but still free.
• Frederick the Great was presented with a challenge by his chaplain to demonstrate the truthfulness of the Bible in one word, and the response was "Israel".
• The survival of Israel over centuries is cited as evidence of God's existence and the truth of the Bible.
• Various historical examples are given, including the Exodus from Egypt, the conquests by Assyria and Babylon, and the Roman Empire's persecution of Christians, to illustrate how God has protected and preserved his people despite overwhelming odds.
• Psalm 129 is a prayer and declaration of God's people in all times and places, describing their oppression and persecution.
• The psalm uses farming imagery to describe the depth and pain of God's people's suffering, but also God's deliverance and freedom from oppressors.
• The Lord cuts the cords of the wicked, ending their oppression and causing the plow to no longer work.
• God's enemies are flourishing in this life, but destined for destruction, as described in an imprecatory prayer in verses 5-8.
• The psalmist uses comical imagery to describe how those who hate Zion will quickly wither away like grass on a rooftop without soil and water.
• The love of God is not fulfilled by following a path that doesn't lead to Him
• C.S. Lewis' quote about standing near the fire or getting into the water to experience warmth or wetness applies to experiencing joy, power, peace, and eternal life through a relationship with God
• When separated from God, people will "wither and die" but when united to Him, they can live forever
• The psalm being discussed is about perseverance in faith
• God's enemies may flourish for now but are ultimately destined for destruction
• The psalm applies to ancient Israel but also has relevance today for Christians experiencing hardship or persecution
• Two practical thoughts on practicing perseverance include praying one's pain and understanding that Jesus is both gentle (lamb) and fierce (lion)
• The imprecatory Psalms, which pray curses on enemies, can be uncomfortable for modern readers but have a place in expressing honest cries to God in times of oppression or abuse.
• Imprecatory prayers in the Bible are mild and only pray for God to not let oppressors prosper
• Praying imprecatory prayers is a way to take injustice to God, rather than retaliating or striking back
• Perseverance in the face of oppression requires bringing it to God in prayer, trusting he is righteous
• Celebrating God's faithfulness, as seen throughout the Bible, is essential for perseverance
• The key to perseverance is not human determination, but God's unalterable and persevering commitment to us
• Perseverance is a result of God's faithfulness, rather than human stamina or ability to avoid failure
