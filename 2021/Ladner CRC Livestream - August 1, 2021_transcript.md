[280.00 --> 282.00]  Good morning.
[282.00 --> 286.00]  Welcome to Latin or CSE.
[286.00 --> 292.00]  I'm Bart Van der Kemp and I'm your worship leader here today.
[292.00 --> 298.00]  Whether you're new here or born in this church and baptized here,
[298.00 --> 306.00]  the Lord calls us together as one expression of his universal body in Christ our Lord.
[306.00 --> 314.00]  After our service, you're invited to join us for coffee or if you prefer juice or tea in the fellowship hall back there.
[314.00 --> 320.00]  Our collection today is for new immigrant support.
[320.00 --> 326.00]  You may place your donation in the box in the hall or send it to the church of Toronto.
[326.00 --> 332.00]  Or send it to the church electronically.
[332.00 --> 338.00]  God's word will be brought to us today by Pastor Michael Yang from Tapestry.
[338.00 --> 343.00]  He is the campus minister of Tapestry Knights.
[343.00 --> 349.00]  Perhaps he will tell us something about what that involves.
[349.00 --> 361.00]  Now we have this great sadness that I need to tell you today of the passing of our brother John Ram yesterday after a sudden downturn in his health.
[361.00 --> 367.00]  Please pray for his wife Janet and the extended Ram family.
[367.00 --> 371.00]  Janet takes comfort in the fact that John is now in heaven with the Lord.
[371.00 --> 377.00]  Further details of the remembrance will be forthcoming.
[377.00 --> 387.00]  You will also have read in the paper that Ryan's grandmother, Ryan Van Bleet's grandmother passed away.
[387.00 --> 391.00]  And we want to extend our condolences to that whole family.
[391.00 --> 401.00]  Jerry and Anne Cran are now both in a peace portal retirement home in White Rock.
[401.00 --> 407.00]  And George DeVos is also not being well and may well join them there before long.
[407.00 --> 416.00]  Let us now quiet our hearts as we enter in the Lord's presence.
[416.00 --> 419.00]  And remember the words of our Lord to the Samaritan woman.
[419.00 --> 425.00]  True worshipers must worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[425.00 --> 435.00]  Please rise if you are able to receive God's greetings.
[435.00 --> 444.00]  Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[444.00 --> 446.00]  In the words of Peter.
[446.00 --> 455.00]  Having received God's greeting, you may now greet each other in whatever way is appropriate at this time of COVID.
[455.00 --> 462.00]  Don't we bring.
[462.00 --> 465.00]  Appreciate it,たぶん!
[465.00 --> 467.00]  cliché
[467.00 --> 473.36] Cron-san
[476.00 --> 483.00]  music
[483.00 --> 499.74]  We will restore you, God and King, and bless your holy name.
[499.74 --> 508.82]  Day after day we'll sing your praise forever and forever.
[508.82 --> 518.82]  One generation will call to the next, our God is good and His hand is strong.
[518.82 --> 530.82]  All the world sings his marvelous act and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[530.82 --> 560.82] 
[560.82 --> 572.82]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[572.82 --> 602.82] 
[602.82 --> 609.82]  Joyful, joyful, joyful, we sing our song.
[609.82 --> 616.82]  Our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[616.82 --> 637.82]  Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love.
[637.82 --> 646.82]  Hearts unfold like flowers before thee, open to the sun above.
[646.82 --> 654.82]  Held the clouds of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away.
[654.82 --> 666.82]  Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.
[666.82 --> 673.82]  All thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heaven reflect thy rays.
[673.82 --> 682.82]  Stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.
[682.82 --> 690.82]  Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow flashing sea.
[690.82 --> 698.82]  Chanting bird and flowing fountain calls us to rejoice in thee.
[698.82 --> 708.82]  Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed.
[708.82 --> 717.82]  Thou spring of the joy of living, ocean depths of happy rest.
[717.82 --> 725.82]  Thou our Father, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thine.
[725.82 --> 729.82]  Teach us how to love each other.
[729.82 --> 734.82]  Lift us to the joy divine.
[734.82 --> 759.46]  He shepherd of my soul, come dwell within me
[759.46 --> 767.08]  Take all I am and mold your likeness in me
[767.08 --> 774.82]  Before the cross of Christ, this is my sacrifice
[774.82 --> 779.84]  A life laid down and ready to follow
[779.84 --> 792.60]  The troubled find their peace in true surrender
[792.60 --> 800.42]  The prisoners there release from chains of anger
[800.42 --> 809.06]  In springs of living grace I find a resting place
[809.06 --> 814.22]  To rise refreshed and determined to follow
[814.22 --> 827.06]  I'll walk this narrow road with Christ before me
[827.86 --> 835.06]  Where thorns and thistles grow and cords ensnare me
[835.06 --> 843.44]  Though doubted and denied, He never leaves my side
[843.44 --> 848.30]  But lifts my head and calls me to follow
[848.30 --> 861.46]  And when my days are gone, my strength is failing
[861.46 --> 869.62]  You carry me along through death's unfailing
[869.62 --> 877.70]  Earth's struggles overcome, heaven's journey's just begun
[877.70 --> 882.86]  To search Christ's depths and ever to follow
[882.86 --> 890.70]  To search Christ's depths and ever to follow
[890.70 --> 895.86]  You may be seated
[895.86 --> 897.86]  You may be seated
[897.86 --> 909.86]  For a time of confession, please pray with me
[909.86 --> 921.02]  Eternal God, we confess that often we have failed you
[921.02 --> 925.52]  We have failed you to be obedient to your good will
[925.52 --> 931.56]  We have ignored your love and struck out on our own
[931.56 --> 936.72]  We have not loved our neighbor as ourselves
[936.72 --> 939.94]  And ignored the cry of the needy
[939.94 --> 944.80]  And in all this, we are masters at deceiving ourselves
[944.80 --> 947.72]  Believing that things are just fine
[947.72 --> 950.72]  Forgive us, we pray
[950.72 --> 956.38]  Set us free so we can follow you obediently
[956.38 --> 959.30]  Through Christ Jesus our Lord
[959.30 --> 960.72]  Amen
[960.72 --> 966.72]  Now to all of you who have shared in our confession
[966.72 --> 970.10]  Remember the words recorded by the Apostle John
[970.10 --> 975.72]  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
[975.72 --> 981.30]  And will forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
[981.30 --> 986.06]  And then hear these words from Psalm 103
[986.06 --> 988.42]  And be at peace
[988.42 --> 993.68]  The Lord is compassionate and gracious
[993.68 --> 996.98]  Slow to anger and abounding in love
[996.98 --> 999.98]  He will not always accuse
[999.98 --> 1002.38]  Nor will He harbor His anger forever
[1002.38 --> 1006.42]  He does not treat us as our sins deserve
[1006.42 --> 1009.64]  Or repay us according to our iniquities
[1009.64 --> 1013.20]  For as high as the heaven above the earth
[1013.20 --> 1016.60]  So great is His love for those who fear Him
[1016.60 --> 1019.62]  As far as the east is from the west
[1019.62 --> 1022.92]  So far has He removed our transgressions from us
[1022.92 --> 1026.76]  And as a father has compassion on his children
[1026.76 --> 1031.86]  So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him
[1031.86 --> 1041.88]  It's now time for the children from three years of age
[1041.88 --> 1042.68]  To grade seven
[1042.68 --> 1046.82]  To leave work in Sunday school
[1046.82 --> 1050.04]  Great is your faithfulness, O God
[1050.04 --> 1062.62]  Great is your faithfulness, O God
[1062.62 --> 1076.36]  Great is your faithfulness, O God
[1076.36 --> 1084.04]  You wrestle with the sinner's heart
[1084.04 --> 1091.32]  You lead us by still waters into mercy
[1091.32 --> 1098.36]  And nothing can keep us apart
[1098.36 --> 1104.36]  So remember your people
[1104.36 --> 1108.20]  Remember your children
[1108.20 --> 1113.74]  Remember your promise, O God
[1113.74 --> 1119.64]  Your grace is enough
[1119.64 --> 1122.68]  Your grace is enough
[1122.68 --> 1129.72]  Your grace is enough for me
[1129.72 --> 1135.72]  Great is your love and justice, God
[1135.72 --> 1144.76]  You use the weak to lead the strong
[1144.76 --> 1152.76]  You lead us in the song of your salvation
[1152.76 --> 1159.80]  And all your people sing along
[1159.80 --> 1164.80]  So remember your people
[1164.80 --> 1167.80]  Remember your children
[1167.80 --> 1173.80]  Remember your promise, O God
[1173.80 --> 1182.84]  Your grace is enough
[1182.84 --> 1186.84]  Your grace is enough
[1186.84 --> 1188.84]  Your grace is enough
[1188.84 --> 1194.78]  Your grace is enough
[1194.78 --> 1198.44]  Your grace is enough
[1198.44 --> 1203.88]  Your grace is enough for me
[1203.88 --> 1209.72]  So remember your people
[1209.72 --> 1213.44]  Remember your children
[1213.44 --> 1219.96]  Remember your promise so long
[1219.96 --> 1224.68]  Your grace is enough
[1224.68 --> 1228.52]  Your grace is enough
[1228.52 --> 1233.90]  Your grace is enough for me
[1233.90 --> 1239.78]  Your grace is enough
[1239.78 --> 1243.28]  Your grace is enough
[1243.28 --> 1248.80]  Your grace is enough for me
[1248.80 --> 1267.62]  Before I invite Pastor Yang up to the pulpit, we are going to read scripture.
[1267.62 --> 1273.14]  There are several passages from Exodus and I will read with you.
[1273.14 --> 1282.66]  When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road to the Philistine country,
[1282.66 --> 1284.66]  though that was shorter.
[1284.66 --> 1289.66]  God said if they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.
[1289.66 --> 1295.18]  So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea.
[1295.18 --> 1301.18]  The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.
[1301.18 --> 1306.70]  After leaving Shakhos, they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
[1306.70 --> 1320.22]  By day, the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.
[1320.22 --> 1330.74]  Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
[1330.74 --> 1336.26]  In the desert, the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
[1336.26 --> 1342.26]  The Israelites said to them, If only we have died by the Lord's hand in Egypt.
[1342.26 --> 1347.26]  There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted.
[1347.26 --> 1353.58]  But you have brought us into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.
[1355.90 --> 1360.62]  Then the Lord said to Moses, I will rain down bread from heaven for you.
[1361.18 --> 1365.10]  The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day.
[1365.74 --> 1370.70]  In this way, I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
[1371.90 --> 1375.74]  On the sixth day, they are to prepare what they bring in,
[1375.74 --> 1380.38]  and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.
[1383.26 --> 1387.74]  The Lord said, Moses said to the Lord, You have been telling me,
[1388.14 --> 1393.42]  Lead these people, but you have not let me know whom you will send with me.
[1394.54 --> 1398.46]  You have said, I know you by name, and you have found favor,
[1398.46 --> 1404.30]  and you have found favor with me.
[1405.02 --> 1411.98]  If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways, so I may know you and continue to find favor with you.
[1412.94 --> 1415.82]  Remember that this nation is your people.
[1415.82 --> 1422.70]  The Lord replied, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
[1423.74 --> 1429.74]  Then Moses said to him, If your presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.
[1431.82 --> 1438.54]  How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people, unless you go with us?
[1438.54 --> 1444.46]  What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?
[1445.42 --> 1450.06]  And the Lord said to Moses, I will do the very thing you have asked,
[1450.62 --> 1454.30]  because I am pleased with you, and I know you by name.
[1455.90 --> 1458.70]  Then Moses said, Show me your glory.
[1458.70 --> 1468.70]  And the Lord said, I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence.
[1469.50 --> 1475.98]  I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
[1476.94 --> 1482.86]  But, he said, you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.
[1482.86 --> 1489.34]  Then the Lord said, There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
[1489.90 --> 1496.62]  When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
[1497.10 --> 1500.54]  Then I will remove my hand, and you will see my back.
[1500.94 --> 1504.22]  But my face, you must not be seen.
[1507.66 --> 1509.58]  So far, the reading of God's word.
[1509.58 --> 1514.62]  Dr. Jan, can I invite you up now?
[1526.22 --> 1527.42]  Hey, good morning, folks.
[1529.10 --> 1536.54]  It is always so good to be with my CRC brothers from other mothers and sisters from different MISTAs.
[1536.54 --> 1542.30]  As mentioned, my name is Michael, and I'm here with my wife, Christy, and my watermelon daughter, Eden.
[1543.58 --> 1544.86]  We're so good to be here.
[1544.86 --> 1546.06]  This is our second time here.
[1546.06 --> 1550.42]  And we were here a few years ago, just a little bit before COVID.
[1551.10 --> 1555.26]  And we, Christy, it was just Christy and I at the time, and we felt so welcomed.
[1555.50 --> 1563.38]  You know, after service, we were in the fellowship hall enjoying cake and coffee, which to me is like peak church experience.
[1563.38 --> 1568.54]  Okay, I honestly, in light of the pandemic, those simple things, huh?
[1569.18 --> 1570.40]  Just mean the world.
[1571.12 --> 1572.42]  So again, I really mean it.
[1572.46 --> 1576.92]  It's good to be back here with you, being able to gather, whether in person or online.
[1577.38 --> 1583.48]  Now, today's sermon comes out of a series we're doing at the Tapestry right now called Stories from Exile.
[1583.98 --> 1585.88]  And so I'm one of the pastors there.
[1586.22 --> 1592.38]  And Tap Nights, for those who don't know, is just the Saturday evening church plant that we started a few years ago.
[1592.38 --> 1594.96]  So we're not used to worshiping on Sunday morning as well.
[1595.08 --> 1595.84]  So this is nice.
[1595.94 --> 1597.36]  It's a lot lighter, you know.
[1597.52 --> 1598.64]  Feel God's presence here.
[1598.72 --> 1598.98]  It's good.
[1600.18 --> 1610.36]  Now, this series at the Tap, it's around this major theme of scripture and the experience of the people of God, both in the Bible, but also today.
[1610.74 --> 1613.42]  And that is the experience of exile.
[1613.94 --> 1615.76]  Let me hear you say exile.
[1616.40 --> 1616.88]  Exile.
[1616.88 --> 1625.70]  Yeah, yeah, exile is not just a displacement from one's homeland, but on a deeper level, it's a displacement from one's soul.
[1626.24 --> 1627.56]  You feel it in you.
[1627.68 --> 1628.46]  It's an ache.
[1628.94 --> 1640.12]  And there are many forms of exile in the scriptures, but one form that we'll talk about today, maybe another image to think about it, is this language around the promised land and the wilderness.
[1640.12 --> 1648.12]  We are like exiles from the promised land or spiritual homeland, and we're trying to make it home through the wilderness deserts.
[1648.74 --> 1649.80]  Are you with me so far?
[1651.14 --> 1653.20]  Now, why talk about this?
[1653.20 --> 1660.24]  Well, it seems that with our pandemic situation, we are kind of coming out of the wilderness, out of exile.
[1660.38 --> 1664.74]  We can see and maybe even begin to enter the promised land, can't we?
[1665.40 --> 1676.04]  But we don't want to leave the wilderness without being formed into a certain kind of person and without having learned lessons from God to help us move forward.
[1676.04 --> 1684.50]  And so today, I want to share the story of that great desert crosser, that great guide in the wilderness, Moses himself.
[1684.96 --> 1690.24]  And Moses' story stretches vast and wide, but we can only cover bits and pieces.
[1690.84 --> 1692.26]  So today, this is where we're headed.
[1692.96 --> 1701.68]  We're going to look at a question from Moses' life and my life that I've been wrestling with for the past year and a half, and I hope it resonates with you.
[1701.68 --> 1708.60]  And that is, how do we be formed as a people ready to enter the promised land?
[1709.14 --> 1717.58]  And so we're going to look at the crucible of the wilderness journey, the crisis in the wilderness journey, and the conclusion of the wilderness journey.
[1718.22 --> 1728.30]  And so some of these things I'm sharing today, it is a little specific out of my experience with my congregation, but I think things may connect with your congregation as well.
[1728.30 --> 1737.64]  And today is not so much teaching and preaching, even though there are elements of that, but I want you to imagine this is me doing pastoral sharing.
[1738.36 --> 1745.16]  It's like, just imagine me and you sitting down to your favorite brewed beverage, and you're asking me, what have I learned this past year?
[1745.22 --> 1746.94]  And I want to open my heart with you.
[1747.14 --> 1749.38]  And if that resonates with you, fantastic.
[1750.08 --> 1757.72]  And if it doesn't land as much, that's okay too, but I have confidence God will speak and move through our time together as we worship.
[1757.72 --> 1761.62]  Okay, so crucibles of the wilderness journey.
[1762.44 --> 1778.10]  Super long story short, Moses is called by God through this strange encounter with a burning bush to go and help deliver God's people, Israel, from slavery out of Egypt, and then to lead them to the promised land, Canaan, promised to their ancestor, Abraham.
[1778.62 --> 1781.76]  That's a summary of the whole first five books of the Bible in 15 seconds.
[1781.76 --> 1792.24]  And so the promised land, you know, the Israelites aren't told much about this, except that it's a land flowing with milk and honey, which sounds great unless you're lactose intolerant.
[1792.68 --> 1796.12]  And so it's also said that it's their home.
[1796.98 --> 1799.16]  In other words, it's where they're meant to be.
[1799.58 --> 1801.02]  It's God's purpose for them.
[1801.02 --> 1812.10]  And so the Israelites wander through the desert to get to the promised land, and we discover that this wilderness journey becomes a crucible for Moses and the people of God.
[1812.56 --> 1820.44]  Now, a crucible literally is a vessel used for refining and melting a substance that requires a high degree of heat.
[1821.10 --> 1829.08]  But metaphorically, we talk about a crucible being a process or situation that refines us, right, that forms us.
[1829.08 --> 1836.36]  And so three images emerge from this time, the crucible that refined Moses and the Israelites.
[1837.30 --> 1843.42]  There's that desert, right, and we heard these passages read, the desert, which is formation by God.
[1843.88 --> 1846.16]  There's the pillar, which is the presence of God.
[1846.34 --> 1849.30]  And then there's this manna, right, sustenance from God.
[1849.72 --> 1853.46]  So God is working through these things on the people during this time.
[1853.60 --> 1855.88]  So let's briefly walk through each of these.
[1855.88 --> 1858.64]  There's this desert formation by God.
[1859.22 --> 1868.60]  It's really interesting, right, as you read the story that the Israelites were not led directly into the promised land right after they left Egypt.
[1869.44 --> 1869.92]  Why?
[1870.54 --> 1872.66]  Why didn't God just take them there right away?
[1873.28 --> 1876.48]  Well, we're told in Exodus 13 they weren't ready for it.
[1876.48 --> 1886.36]  If they entered the promised land too early, they would be fearful and fearful of the battles they needed to fight there and wish to return to Egypt.
[1886.90 --> 1894.62]  So the desert was to train and test and form them into the kind of people who could actually live and thrive in the promised land.
[1894.62 --> 1900.34]  So to use an old cliche, could it be that the journey is the destination?
[1901.44 --> 1909.16]  Or who we are becoming is perhaps more important than simply where we are going?
[1911.18 --> 1914.70]  And then there is this pillar, the presence of God.
[1914.80 --> 1921.02]  We're told that God leads the Israelites as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
[1921.02 --> 1932.34]  So instead of giving Israel a schedule and a map or an itinerary, which I know for some of you gives you life, like an itinerary is your spiritual gift, God does not do that.
[1932.96 --> 1935.18]  God doesn't give them a map or a guide.
[1935.78 --> 1944.30]  All they're told is to camp around God's presence, to be with God one step at a time, every step of the way.
[1944.30 --> 1949.16]  And then we're given this image of the manna, sustenance from God.
[1949.32 --> 1953.84]  We're told that God rains down bread from heaven each morning to sustain them.
[1954.30 --> 1958.54]  And so God is not like, here's a Costco membership card, go buy in bulk.
[1959.96 --> 1961.48]  Nah, you can't do that in the wilderness.
[1962.50 --> 1967.20]  They are sustained instead by daily bread, literally daily bread.
[1967.20 --> 1975.34]  And so spiritually, we're learning that we aren't supposed to have a Costco relationship with God either.
[1975.58 --> 1982.36]  You know, I myself want to often just stock up on those past experiences and previous experiences,
[1982.36 --> 1986.98]  but God invites us to daily, fresh encounter.
[1987.54 --> 1989.92]  That's the only way to live with God.
[1989.92 --> 1994.50]  And so God reveals to Moses and the Israelites during this crucible time,
[1994.96 --> 2000.02]  you have to trust that I am enough, sufficient for you.
[2001.04 --> 2007.22]  Now, I hope you are starting to make some connections and parallels between the wilderness time
[2007.22 --> 2009.76]  and our own experience during the pandemic.
[2010.24 --> 2012.30]  So I want to share a few things I've noticed.
[2012.58 --> 2018.52]  It's hardly exhaustive of what God has been doing in our churches and in the midst of our communities.
[2018.52 --> 2023.10]  But I hope that you will see some connections here with you as well.
[2023.62 --> 2030.04]  And so beginning with the promised land, you know, if you asked most churches pre-COVID,
[2030.20 --> 2031.66]  what is the promised land?
[2032.14 --> 2036.64]  I imagine most churches would say a thriving and growing church, right?
[2036.72 --> 2042.80]  Not a land flowing with milk and honey, but a church flowing with maturity and multiplication.
[2043.66 --> 2047.00]  Maturity defined as deep discipleship to Jesus.
[2047.00 --> 2047.28]  Yes.
[2047.68 --> 2048.90]  And multiplication, right?
[2048.92 --> 2054.76]  We're here to multiply disciples, leaders, ministries, and maybe even churches to plant more churches.
[2055.76 --> 2057.06]  And then the pandemic hit.
[2057.70 --> 2063.40]  And I think for most churches, the promised land was just trying to get back together in whatever form.
[2063.40 --> 2070.34]  And so, friends, we've taken the long way to the promised land, haven't we?
[2071.26 --> 2076.00]  Like the Israelites, we're learning that just as there's no shortcuts to the promised land,
[2076.08 --> 2081.60]  there are no shortcuts to genuine maturity and healthy multiplication as a church.
[2082.12 --> 2089.18]  Pandemic or not, it was never going to be as easy or automatic as some of us hoped.
[2089.18 --> 2092.10]  And then so, there's this desert.
[2092.76 --> 2097.04]  There's this desert of the pandemic itself, which is meant to form us.
[2097.64 --> 2103.12]  And I imagine that many of you have tried to deepen your spiritual life and practices with God
[2103.12 --> 2105.28]  in the midst of these challenging times.
[2105.78 --> 2109.24]  Maybe you've learned to have to slow down in this season,
[2109.62 --> 2114.36]  to serve others in need because there was a lot of need.
[2114.36 --> 2120.90]  Maybe you had to relearn or grow in your understanding of worship and Sabbath in this season.
[2121.28 --> 2124.64]  And I'm sure some of you were formed into deeper life with God.
[2125.38 --> 2127.62]  But the truth is, it's been a testing time.
[2127.70 --> 2131.28]  It's been a hard year for all of us in terms of our discipleship, huh?
[2131.82 --> 2137.70]  And sometimes we have moved towards the direction God wanted us to and is good for us.
[2137.70 --> 2143.88]  But other times we've moved to the direction that God did not want for us and is not good for us.
[2143.94 --> 2145.52]  But it's been a formative time.
[2146.62 --> 2147.84]  And then there's this pillar.
[2148.72 --> 2154.64]  We've all had to be creative around camping around the presence of God, haven't we?
[2154.96 --> 2160.02]  So for many churches, that meant worshiping online through YouTube or gathering on Zoom.
[2160.62 --> 2164.58]  And I know we all have Zoom fatigue or just flat-out hate Zoom.
[2164.58 --> 2167.68]  But I have to say, thank God for Zoom.
[2168.38 --> 2171.72]  Can you imagine if this pandemic hit like 20 years ago?
[2172.06 --> 2173.54]  What would we be using?
[2173.90 --> 2175.92]  Like MSN messenger chat rooms?
[2177.16 --> 2180.18]  Maybe for some of you that landed, maybe for some of you that didn't.
[2180.32 --> 2181.84]  But that to me is like, ugh, no.
[2183.78 --> 2186.76]  And so there's also this idea of manna, right?
[2187.40 --> 2189.48]  We've seen God's sustenance.
[2189.48 --> 2196.62]  God showing up and coming through, not in abundance, but not in scarcity either, right?
[2196.64 --> 2203.52]  Not a Costco relationship with God in this season, but daily sustenance, regular bread, right?
[2203.60 --> 2205.56]  Daily bread, as Jesus taught us.
[2206.94 --> 2208.38]  Are you all picking up what I'm putting down?
[2209.32 --> 2209.52]  Okay.
[2210.20 --> 2215.18]  So just like the Israelites, God is forming us and will continue to form us, right?
[2215.18 --> 2223.96]  The scary thing is, it wasn't just a few years, but it was decades of formation that God put the Israelites through.
[2224.42 --> 2227.60]  And so some of the things I'm talking about, it will be ongoing.
[2227.96 --> 2231.12]  God is just getting started with our churches in some ways.
[2231.68 --> 2237.78]  But just like for Moses, there comes a crisis moment in the wilderness.
[2237.78 --> 2243.72]  And maybe for you, this whole past year and a half has been one long crisis or contained multiple crises.
[2244.02 --> 2248.88]  But for Moses, there's one moment in particular where everything almost derailed.
[2249.56 --> 2254.84]  And so in Exodus 32, we're told about this incident with the golden calf.
[2255.80 --> 2261.58]  And so Moses is up on Mount Sinai, hearing a word from the Lord, meeting with God.
[2261.58 --> 2268.90]  And the Israelites are down at the base of the mountain, and they grow impatient, seeing neither their God nor their religious leader.
[2269.02 --> 2276.22]  They create an idol, a golden calf, for themselves and say that this is their God who brought them up out of Egypt.
[2276.80 --> 2280.68]  And they give themselves to false worship and all sorts of wild indulgences.
[2281.02 --> 2285.30]  And after Moses comes down from the mountain, he's just shocked by all this.
[2285.88 --> 2289.94]  He calls the people to repentance, and God has to punish them.
[2289.94 --> 2297.66]  And even though God eventually does forgive them, God says, I will no longer go with you into the promised land.
[2297.82 --> 2301.98]  I'm going to send some deputy angel to be in charge of you stiff-necked people.
[2304.56 --> 2311.26]  And by Exodus 33, we have the first instance of pastoral burnout in the Bible.
[2312.64 --> 2317.76]  Because Moses and God gather in the tent of meeting, as it's called.
[2317.76 --> 2325.50]  And we now get to listen in on what I think is one of the most fascinating, compelling conversations in all of Scripture.
[2325.98 --> 2329.46]  Now, this conversation is broken up into three parts for our time together.
[2329.74 --> 2334.40]  And it begins with Moses each time asking God for something.
[2334.92 --> 2336.82]  So let's just dive into this, okay?
[2337.12 --> 2342.02]  So first, Moses asks for wisdom and guidance as a leader.
[2342.02 --> 2345.36]  So verse 12 of Exodus 33, it says,
[2346.20 --> 2349.48]  Moses said to the Lord, you have been telling me, lead these people.
[2349.96 --> 2353.34]  But you have not let me know whom you will send with me.
[2353.56 --> 2355.62]  Remember, God's no longer going with them.
[2356.02 --> 2359.94]  You have said, I know you by name, and you have found favor with me.
[2360.10 --> 2362.96]  If you are pleased with me, teach me your way,
[2363.54 --> 2367.28]  so that I may know you and continue to find favor with you.
[2367.68 --> 2370.98]  Remember that this nation is your people.
[2370.98 --> 2374.04]  So to lead the people effectively,
[2374.22 --> 2377.56]  Moses needed to know God's way with God's people and God's world.
[2378.00 --> 2382.80]  Teach me your ways is the key thing he longs for here.
[2383.46 --> 2386.96]  And so in this crisis, Moses is learning what we all need to learn,
[2387.94 --> 2391.70]  that we really depend on God.
[2392.12 --> 2397.16]  We are to ask for God's wisdom and guidance for what God has entrusted to us,
[2397.48 --> 2399.26]  who God has entrusted to us.
[2399.26 --> 2403.20]  And often being called out far beyond our competence
[2403.20 --> 2406.54]  is part of our regular experience with God.
[2407.06 --> 2408.56]  Now, I think this past year and a half,
[2408.70 --> 2412.90]  we've all been called out of our comfort and competence zones.
[2413.46 --> 2414.32]  But here's the thing,
[2414.42 --> 2418.72]  God loves to work in those stretching crises moments,
[2418.72 --> 2420.04]  because if we're honest,
[2420.14 --> 2422.64]  that's the times when we most seek God
[2422.64 --> 2424.46]  and are open to growth, aren't we?
[2424.46 --> 2427.72]  And so to Moses' request,
[2428.14 --> 2429.24]  listen to this.
[2429.74 --> 2430.78]  The Lord replied,
[2430.92 --> 2433.34]  My presence will go with you,
[2433.58 --> 2435.74]  and I will give you rest.
[2437.74 --> 2438.10]  Yeah.
[2439.62 --> 2444.20]  This is one of the most beautiful lines in the scriptures.
[2444.46 --> 2446.32]  My presence will go with you,
[2446.58 --> 2448.96]  and I will give you rest.
[2449.38 --> 2450.16]  Come on now.
[2450.16 --> 2453.22]  For a weary person,
[2453.38 --> 2455.50]  especially a weary leader like Moses,
[2455.70 --> 2458.76]  this is ice-cold water in the heat of the desert.
[2460.76 --> 2462.78]  And in response to this second ask,
[2463.94 --> 2465.26]  in response to this,
[2465.34 --> 2465.46]  sorry,
[2465.60 --> 2467.62]  Moses makes his second ask,
[2467.70 --> 2468.42]  his request.
[2469.04 --> 2470.22]  Then Moses said to him,
[2470.50 --> 2472.46]  If your presence does not go with us,
[2472.52 --> 2473.92]  do not send us up from here.
[2474.16 --> 2476.96]  How will anyone know that you are pleased with me
[2476.96 --> 2479.52]  and with your people unless you go with us?
[2479.62 --> 2481.28]  What else will distinguish me
[2481.28 --> 2482.20]  and your people
[2482.20 --> 2483.64]  from all the other people
[2483.64 --> 2484.72]  on the face of the earth?
[2485.58 --> 2487.32]  So the Lord had said to Moses,
[2487.58 --> 2489.10]  My presence will go with you.
[2489.78 --> 2490.26]  Singular.
[2491.14 --> 2492.18]  And Moses is like,
[2492.30 --> 2493.70]  Yeah, God, that ain't good enough.
[2494.16 --> 2495.58]  I want you to go with us.
[2496.14 --> 2497.38]  Your people.
[2498.24 --> 2500.76]  Moses here knows what's most important
[2500.76 --> 2502.34]  for the people of God,
[2502.46 --> 2504.94]  and that is God.
[2504.94 --> 2508.28]  Moses asked that wonderful question
[2508.28 --> 2510.84]  every church must constantly ask itself.
[2511.34 --> 2513.08]  What else will distinguish us
[2513.08 --> 2514.74]  from all the other people
[2514.74 --> 2515.82]  on the face of the earth?
[2516.52 --> 2518.30]  And it's that relationship
[2518.30 --> 2519.90]  with the God we know
[2519.90 --> 2522.44]  and the God who knows us.
[2524.50 --> 2525.74]  And so the Lord said to Moses,
[2526.22 --> 2528.04]  I will do the very thing you have asked
[2528.04 --> 2529.56]  because I am pleased with you
[2529.56 --> 2531.32]  and I know you by name.
[2532.22 --> 2534.20]  Again, God grants Moses request
[2534.20 --> 2536.20]  and it's because God is pleased with Moses.
[2536.34 --> 2537.38]  God delights in Moses.
[2537.54 --> 2538.50]  God knows Moses.
[2538.92 --> 2539.48]  God's like,
[2539.76 --> 2540.70]  For you, Moe,
[2541.16 --> 2542.76]  sure, I'll do it.
[2544.82 --> 2547.52]  And then we have
[2547.52 --> 2549.52]  one of the most awkward,
[2550.50 --> 2552.46]  fascinating, mysterious moments
[2552.46 --> 2552.98]  in the Bible.
[2553.98 --> 2555.52]  Before he can control himself,
[2555.66 --> 2557.10]  before he knows what he's doing,
[2557.26 --> 2559.36]  Moses blurts out his final ask.
[2559.76 --> 2560.60]  Then Moses said,
[2560.72 --> 2561.86]  Now show me your glory.
[2561.86 --> 2567.00]  The way I read this story,
[2567.14 --> 2568.98]  it just shoots right out of his mouth
[2568.98 --> 2571.02]  and it just hangs there
[2571.02 --> 2572.90]  in this long,
[2573.68 --> 2575.54]  awkward silence
[2575.54 --> 2577.78]  between him and God.
[2583.78 --> 2585.30]  Because nobody,
[2585.50 --> 2588.06]  nobody talks to God like this
[2588.06 --> 2589.28]  or the gods like this
[2589.28 --> 2590.26]  in Moses' day.
[2590.36 --> 2591.88]  This is unheard of.
[2592.44 --> 2594.06]  My favorite Old Testament scholar,
[2594.18 --> 2594.74]  Ellen Davis,
[2594.94 --> 2595.92]  she puts it this way,
[2596.34 --> 2599.24]  I'm sure Moses surprised himself
[2599.24 --> 2601.04]  with that rash,
[2601.32 --> 2602.98]  even crude demand.
[2603.12 --> 2604.34]  For it is crude,
[2605.00 --> 2606.04]  completely lacking
[2606.04 --> 2607.34]  in religious refinement.
[2607.86 --> 2608.84]  Moses wants God
[2608.84 --> 2610.68]  to strut his stuff for him,
[2611.08 --> 2612.22]  a private showing
[2612.22 --> 2613.48]  of the divine being.
[2613.48 --> 2615.28]  Yeah,
[2615.48 --> 2617.00]  Moses is asking God
[2617.00 --> 2618.74]  for God's full glory,
[2619.04 --> 2619.80]  full self.
[2619.96 --> 2621.28]  Show it all to me, God,
[2621.44 --> 2623.06]  is what Moses asks.
[2623.52 --> 2624.56]  And what happens?
[2625.48 --> 2626.68]  Listen to this, church.
[2626.78 --> 2627.60]  And the Lord said,
[2627.92 --> 2628.98]  I will cause
[2628.98 --> 2630.52]  all my goodness
[2630.52 --> 2631.88]  to pass in front of you.
[2632.02 --> 2633.56]  And I will proclaim my name,
[2633.66 --> 2634.34]  the Lord,
[2634.70 --> 2635.58]  in your presence.
[2635.90 --> 2636.92]  I will have mercy
[2636.92 --> 2638.22]  on whom I'll have mercy,
[2638.32 --> 2639.34]  and I'll have compassion
[2639.34 --> 2641.22]  on whom I'll have compassion.
[2641.22 --> 2642.86]  But, he said,
[2643.28 --> 2644.94]  you cannot see my face,
[2645.50 --> 2647.14]  for no one may see me
[2647.14 --> 2648.62]  and live.
[2650.42 --> 2654.12]  God's answer is yes and no.
[2654.98 --> 2656.26]  I will allow you
[2656.26 --> 2657.54]  to see my goodness,
[2658.38 --> 2659.80]  a characteristic of mine.
[2660.00 --> 2661.40]  I'll proclaim my name
[2661.40 --> 2663.02]  so you hear it, Yahweh.
[2663.42 --> 2666.06]  I'll confirm my mercy and grace,
[2666.06 --> 2668.48]  but my glory, no more.
[2668.48 --> 2671.68]  You can't handle it.
[2673.34 --> 2674.72]  And I think God
[2674.72 --> 2677.00]  is so gracious here
[2677.00 --> 2678.30]  because God knew
[2678.30 --> 2679.84]  what Moses really needed
[2679.84 --> 2681.22]  was not God's glory
[2681.22 --> 2682.26]  in that moment,
[2682.40 --> 2683.16]  but the assurance
[2683.16 --> 2684.00]  of God's goodness.
[2684.76 --> 2686.30]  Because Moses had seen
[2686.30 --> 2687.92]  signs and wonders,
[2688.14 --> 2689.08]  things that would knock
[2689.08 --> 2690.88]  any of us flat on our butts
[2690.88 --> 2692.14]  if we had seen them.
[2692.48 --> 2693.14]  But really,
[2693.14 --> 2694.14]  what Moses needed
[2694.70 --> 2696.12]  and what we need
[2696.12 --> 2696.96]  in this season
[2696.96 --> 2699.46]  is God's goodness, right?
[2700.72 --> 2702.34]  Because in times of crisis,
[2702.74 --> 2704.26]  heartbreak, loss,
[2704.38 --> 2705.32]  a global pandemic,
[2705.82 --> 2708.04]  sure, we want to know
[2708.04 --> 2709.50]  that God is powerful
[2709.50 --> 2710.46]  and in charge,
[2710.70 --> 2712.20]  but we need to know
[2712.20 --> 2714.56]  that God is good,
[2715.16 --> 2716.60]  that God is with us
[2716.60 --> 2718.48]  and for us through it all.
[2719.78 --> 2720.48]  And so here,
[2720.66 --> 2721.82]  between Moses and God,
[2721.82 --> 2723.26]  is this intimate encounter
[2723.26 --> 2725.16]  that changes Moses forever.
[2725.16 --> 2726.84]  the author
[2726.84 --> 2727.94]  and spiritual director,
[2728.08 --> 2729.06]  Ruth Haley Barton,
[2729.56 --> 2731.04]  she wrote a wonderful book
[2731.04 --> 2731.96]  on Moses called
[2731.96 --> 2733.54]  Strengthening the Soul
[2733.54 --> 2734.44]  of Your Leadership.
[2735.16 --> 2736.08]  Strengthening the Soul
[2736.08 --> 2736.64]  of Your Leadership.
[2736.80 --> 2738.08]  I highly recommend it.
[2738.20 --> 2739.24]  Definitely top 10 books
[2739.24 --> 2740.04]  I've ever read.
[2740.44 --> 2741.10]  I recommend it
[2741.10 --> 2742.44]  to anyone who's responsible
[2742.44 --> 2743.50]  for any people
[2743.50 --> 2744.78]  in any capacity.
[2745.62 --> 2746.62]  And so she concludes
[2746.62 --> 2747.36]  her reflection
[2747.36 --> 2749.94]  on this part of Moses' life
[2749.94 --> 2750.62]  by saying,
[2750.62 --> 2753.04]  this became a place
[2753.04 --> 2754.34]  of encounter with God
[2754.34 --> 2755.16]  that led first
[2755.16 --> 2756.26]  to personal worship
[2756.26 --> 2757.88]  and not just an ability
[2757.88 --> 2760.08]  to mediate the very nature
[2760.08 --> 2761.24]  and presence of God
[2761.24 --> 2761.86]  to the people.
[2762.30 --> 2764.86]  Moses emerged from solitude,
[2765.38 --> 2766.94]  knowing what he needed to know
[2766.94 --> 2768.34]  to remain faithful
[2768.34 --> 2769.80]  to his calling
[2769.80 --> 2771.94]  and his face shown
[2771.94 --> 2773.82]  with the knowledge of it.
[2773.82 --> 2778.54]  And so church,
[2778.70 --> 2779.68]  I want to share
[2779.68 --> 2781.40]  why I'm talking about Moses,
[2781.68 --> 2782.70]  why I personally
[2782.70 --> 2783.94]  was so drawn to Moses
[2783.94 --> 2785.42]  and this part of his story.
[2786.28 --> 2786.70]  You see,
[2786.80 --> 2788.50]  I too had a crisis
[2788.50 --> 2789.56]  in the wilderness
[2789.56 --> 2791.22]  and I experienced
[2791.22 --> 2792.12]  pastoral burnout.
[2793.16 --> 2794.18]  This past year,
[2794.24 --> 2794.96]  because of COVID,
[2795.14 --> 2796.30]  it's been the hardest year
[2796.30 --> 2797.00]  of my life
[2797.00 --> 2798.16]  in terms of my pastoring
[2798.16 --> 2798.70]  and leadership
[2798.70 --> 2800.18]  and discipleship to Jesus.
[2800.64 --> 2801.98]  Everything changed, right?
[2801.98 --> 2802.66]  For you,
[2802.74 --> 2803.40]  you've experienced
[2803.40 --> 2804.36]  so much change,
[2804.62 --> 2805.86]  so much uncertainty,
[2806.50 --> 2808.16]  and there still is uncertainty.
[2809.12 --> 2810.22]  And so for the first time
[2810.22 --> 2811.14]  since 2014,
[2811.14 --> 2812.34]  when I was first called
[2812.34 --> 2813.34]  to be a pastor,
[2813.88 --> 2814.88]  I had thoughts
[2814.88 --> 2816.72]  about quitting pastoral ministry.
[2816.92 --> 2817.58]  I'm just going to be honest
[2817.58 --> 2818.00]  with you.
[2818.36 --> 2820.88]  And just do something else,
[2821.26 --> 2822.44]  anything else,
[2822.70 --> 2823.56]  except I don't have
[2823.56 --> 2825.00]  any transferable skills.
[2825.76 --> 2827.42]  So I wasn't sure
[2827.42 --> 2828.94]  what that would even entail.
[2829.24 --> 2829.70]  But anyway,
[2829.70 --> 2832.42]  so by March of 2020,
[2832.86 --> 2834.24]  right before the pandemic,
[2834.46 --> 2835.64]  just to give some context,
[2836.08 --> 2837.64]  at our church at Tap Nights,
[2837.68 --> 2839.06]  we had 150,
[2839.22 --> 2841.04]  160 people participating
[2841.04 --> 2843.22]  every Saturday on average.
[2843.42 --> 2844.98]  And we had doubled in size
[2844.98 --> 2846.38]  from when we first planted
[2846.38 --> 2847.52]  a year and a half in.
[2847.94 --> 2848.84]  We were excited
[2848.84 --> 2849.72]  about our growth.
[2849.84 --> 2850.72]  We were helpful.
[2850.88 --> 2851.58]  We were hopeful
[2851.58 --> 2852.94]  about what God was doing.
[2853.26 --> 2854.54]  And then the pandemic hit
[2854.54 --> 2856.48]  and we tried to hold
[2856.48 --> 2858.20]  these weekly online services
[2858.20 --> 2858.84]  on Zoom.
[2858.84 --> 2860.48]  and we had weeks
[2860.48 --> 2861.40]  where there were about
[2861.40 --> 2864.32]  seven or eight screens online.
[2864.72 --> 2867.68]  So 150 down to eight
[2867.68 --> 2869.36]  in the span of a month.
[2869.90 --> 2870.64]  And naturally,
[2870.84 --> 2872.10]  the question arose was,
[2872.40 --> 2874.10]  well, where was the church?
[2874.68 --> 2875.84]  Where were the people?
[2876.54 --> 2878.74]  Because almost every single week
[2878.74 --> 2879.48]  during the pandemic,
[2879.48 --> 2881.28]  we hosted these worship services.
[2881.60 --> 2882.72]  We had these places
[2882.72 --> 2884.26]  where people to gather online.
[2885.06 --> 2886.36]  But where were they?
[2886.36 --> 2889.08]  It felt like we had lost
[2889.08 --> 2890.66]  people in the wilderness.
[2891.30 --> 2894.88]  And I felt like I had failed
[2894.88 --> 2896.80]  the people in the wilderness.
[2897.22 --> 2898.36]  I failed as a leader,
[2898.54 --> 2899.84]  a shepherd, a guide.
[2900.94 --> 2902.44]  And so in the heart of last summer,
[2902.62 --> 2903.46]  about a year ago,
[2903.60 --> 2904.62]  I hit bottom.
[2905.34 --> 2906.96]  I remember sitting in my backyard
[2906.96 --> 2908.22]  with a good friend of mine
[2908.22 --> 2909.96]  and just sharing some of these things,
[2910.38 --> 2911.52]  these disappointments
[2911.52 --> 2912.36]  and heartache.
[2912.36 --> 2913.80]  And it was the first time
[2913.80 --> 2914.68]  I shared with someone
[2914.68 --> 2916.08]  outside of my wife, Christy,
[2916.10 --> 2917.44]  that I had thoughts about
[2917.44 --> 2919.12]  maybe quitting pastoral ministry.
[2919.88 --> 2921.30]  And so he was
[2921.30 --> 2922.94]  and is such a good friend.
[2923.06 --> 2923.92]  He was just listening,
[2924.36 --> 2925.20]  encouraging me,
[2925.70 --> 2926.72]  reminding me
[2926.72 --> 2928.08]  of what I knew
[2928.08 --> 2929.78]  but was finding hard to grasp
[2929.78 --> 2932.26]  and that it wasn't about me
[2932.26 --> 2933.62]  because I was making it
[2933.62 --> 2935.20]  very personal at that point.
[2936.10 --> 2936.82]  And he said,
[2936.82 --> 2937.62]  it's not personal.
[2938.30 --> 2938.78]  And he said,
[2938.84 --> 2939.14]  Michael,
[2939.30 --> 2941.32]  it's hard for everyone
[2941.32 --> 2942.78]  to follow God right now.
[2942.90 --> 2944.34]  It's actually always been hard.
[2945.10 --> 2946.02]  And just because people
[2946.02 --> 2947.56]  aren't attending our services
[2947.56 --> 2948.42]  doesn't mean people
[2948.42 --> 2950.00]  aren't being discipled by Jesus
[2950.00 --> 2951.36]  or they don't love Jesus.
[2951.64 --> 2951.84]  I mean,
[2951.94 --> 2953.00]  maybe they don't
[2953.00 --> 2954.58]  but how do you know?
[2955.68 --> 2956.94]  Or how do you
[2956.94 --> 2958.70]  handle all this
[2958.70 --> 2960.44]  in a way that can honor God?
[2960.92 --> 2962.16]  Why are you counting
[2962.16 --> 2963.34]  and comparing
[2963.34 --> 2965.14]  and trying to control things
[2965.14 --> 2967.00]  beyond your control,
[2967.18 --> 2968.02]  beyond you?
[2969.50 --> 2970.50]  And so I remember
[2970.50 --> 2971.36]  reading the story
[2971.36 --> 2972.90]  of Moses early last year
[2972.90 --> 2974.28]  and then having a chance
[2974.28 --> 2975.04]  to reflect on it
[2975.04 --> 2976.62]  for a year and a half now
[2976.62 --> 2977.34]  and I realized
[2977.34 --> 2978.48]  that I asked
[2978.48 --> 2979.96]  and I'm still asking
[2979.96 --> 2981.94]  these three things
[2981.94 --> 2983.38]  that Moses asked.
[2984.20 --> 2985.42]  Teach me your way.
[2986.32 --> 2987.30]  Go with us.
[2988.12 --> 2989.46]  Now show me your glory.
[2990.72 --> 2991.82]  These are my prayers
[2991.82 --> 2992.78]  for this journey
[2992.78 --> 2995.02]  and I humbly offer them
[2995.02 --> 2996.06]  to you as well.
[2996.22 --> 2997.38]  Perhaps they are prayers
[2997.38 --> 2999.88]  for you as a church too.
[3001.02 --> 3003.04]  So I pray each day now
[3003.04 --> 3004.10]  for God to teach me
[3004.10 --> 3005.50]  God's way for God's people
[3005.50 --> 3006.40]  and God's world.
[3006.56 --> 3008.14]  I'm tired of doing it my way.
[3009.08 --> 3010.00]  And my great desire
[3010.00 --> 3010.76]  for my church
[3010.76 --> 3012.04]  and my prayer for yours
[3012.04 --> 3014.08]  is God go with us.
[3014.60 --> 3014.74]  Right?
[3014.86 --> 3015.40]  Emmanuel,
[3015.82 --> 3017.06]  God with us.
[3017.54 --> 3018.92]  Every step of the way.
[3019.88 --> 3020.68]  And then on a deep
[3020.68 --> 3021.56]  personal level,
[3021.56 --> 3022.42]  I've come to see
[3022.42 --> 3023.54]  how important it is
[3023.54 --> 3024.46]  for myself
[3024.46 --> 3027.34]  to ask to see God's glory
[3027.34 --> 3029.66]  and to enjoy God for myself,
[3029.86 --> 3030.82]  not for the sake
[3030.82 --> 3031.96]  of the people I lead.
[3032.56 --> 3033.70]  And God has answered
[3033.70 --> 3034.52]  this desire.
[3035.06 --> 3035.88]  Like Moses,
[3036.06 --> 3037.24]  God's glory often takes
[3037.24 --> 3038.50]  the form of God's goodness
[3038.50 --> 3039.90]  shown to me.
[3039.94 --> 3040.90]  And I can stand here
[3040.90 --> 3042.60]  and say with full confidence
[3042.60 --> 3044.64]  that in spite of all
[3044.64 --> 3045.50]  that has happened,
[3046.00 --> 3046.92]  God is good.
[3046.92 --> 3047.92]  God is good.
[3047.92 --> 3048.84]  And in light of all
[3048.84 --> 3049.70]  that will happen,
[3050.02 --> 3050.94]  God is good.
[3051.76 --> 3053.04]  And I believe some of you
[3053.04 --> 3054.46]  who have experienced
[3054.46 --> 3055.46]  unimaginable,
[3055.62 --> 3056.56]  unexpected loss
[3056.56 --> 3057.26]  in this season
[3057.26 --> 3058.12]  and in your life,
[3058.56 --> 3059.32]  perhaps today
[3059.32 --> 3060.36]  you can also say,
[3060.46 --> 3062.90]  God is good.
[3064.54 --> 3065.66]  And like Moses,
[3066.16 --> 3067.08]  I've been invited
[3067.08 --> 3067.72]  to cultivate
[3067.72 --> 3069.34]  a consistent practice
[3069.34 --> 3070.92]  of being with God,
[3071.00 --> 3072.30]  of silence and solitude
[3072.30 --> 3073.06]  and abiding.
[3073.06 --> 3074.54]  And I've come to see
[3074.54 --> 3075.54]  what I need to know
[3075.54 --> 3076.40]  to remain faithful
[3076.40 --> 3077.36]  to my calling.
[3077.86 --> 3078.94]  And I hope my face
[3078.94 --> 3080.40]  will shine with the glow
[3080.40 --> 3081.66]  of somebody spending
[3081.66 --> 3083.68]  intimate time with God.
[3083.90 --> 3085.48]  You all know those people, right?
[3085.74 --> 3087.46]  You can see it on their faces,
[3087.68 --> 3088.26]  can't you?
[3088.56 --> 3090.56]  That they delight in the Lord.
[3091.24 --> 3093.02]  In the words of my friend,
[3093.14 --> 3093.68]  Jeff Young,
[3093.84 --> 3094.62]  who likes to say
[3094.62 --> 3095.38]  that our faces
[3095.38 --> 3096.70]  should reflect that delight,
[3097.04 --> 3097.74]  he always says,
[3098.02 --> 3099.24]  remind your face, pastor.
[3100.64 --> 3101.66]  Remind your face.
[3103.06 --> 3105.32]  And so friends,
[3105.46 --> 3107.12]  there's this crucible
[3107.12 --> 3107.80]  in the wilderness,
[3108.24 --> 3109.24]  there's this crisis
[3109.24 --> 3109.94]  in the wilderness,
[3110.78 --> 3111.52]  and then there is
[3111.52 --> 3113.80]  a conclusion to it all.
[3114.50 --> 3116.18]  So even though our stories
[3116.18 --> 3117.16]  as disciples
[3117.16 --> 3118.04]  and as churches
[3118.04 --> 3119.02]  are not over,
[3119.12 --> 3120.22]  we can see how it ended
[3120.22 --> 3120.78]  for Moses
[3120.78 --> 3122.32]  and draw some conclusions.
[3123.20 --> 3123.86]  Once again,
[3124.00 --> 3125.60]  super long story short,
[3126.14 --> 3126.96]  Moses and those
[3126.96 --> 3127.70]  first generation
[3127.70 --> 3128.44]  of Israelites
[3128.44 --> 3129.64]  who are delivered
[3129.64 --> 3130.22]  out of Egypt
[3130.22 --> 3131.80]  actually do not enter
[3131.80 --> 3132.74]  the promised land.
[3133.06 --> 3134.68]  for a variety of reasons,
[3134.84 --> 3135.50]  of fear,
[3135.84 --> 3136.28]  failure,
[3136.50 --> 3137.06]  faithlessness.
[3137.70 --> 3139.08]  You can read about more,
[3139.24 --> 3140.34]  more about that
[3140.34 --> 3141.94]  in Numbers chapters 13
[3141.94 --> 3142.42]  to 14
[3142.42 --> 3143.42]  for that generation,
[3143.68 --> 3145.04]  but also Numbers 20
[3145.04 --> 3146.16]  for Moses himself.
[3147.00 --> 3147.72]  And so by the time
[3147.72 --> 3149.46]  we get to Deuteronomy 34,
[3149.68 --> 3150.66]  the last chapter
[3150.66 --> 3151.34]  in the Torah,
[3151.52 --> 3152.22]  the last chapter
[3152.22 --> 3153.08]  in Moses' life,
[3153.40 --> 3154.48]  a whole new generation
[3154.48 --> 3155.40]  has been raised up.
[3155.72 --> 3156.32]  They're at the edge
[3156.32 --> 3157.16]  of the promised land,
[3157.22 --> 3158.28]  they're about to enter in
[3158.28 --> 3159.18]  after 40 years,
[3159.18 --> 3160.38]  and they have a new leader,
[3160.38 --> 3161.34]  Joshua,
[3161.66 --> 3162.48]  to take him in.
[3163.10 --> 3166.28]  But God brings Moses up
[3166.28 --> 3166.84]  on a mountain
[3166.84 --> 3167.66]  to do what?
[3168.74 --> 3172.22]  To see the very promised land
[3172.22 --> 3174.04]  that he cannot enter.
[3175.12 --> 3176.16]  So listen to this,
[3176.72 --> 3177.68]  Deuteronomy 34,
[3177.68 --> 3179.90]  then Moses climbed Mount Nebo
[3179.90 --> 3181.26]  from the plains of Moab
[3181.26 --> 3182.50]  to the top of Pisgah,
[3182.84 --> 3183.92]  across from Jericho.
[3184.32 --> 3185.36]  There the Lord showed him
[3185.36 --> 3186.30]  the whole land.
[3186.72 --> 3187.74]  Then the Lord said to him,
[3187.96 --> 3189.06]  this is the land
[3189.06 --> 3190.50]  I promised on oath
[3190.50 --> 3191.30]  to Abraham,
[3191.68 --> 3192.00]  Isaac,
[3192.10 --> 3192.60]  and Jacob
[3192.60 --> 3193.38]  when I said,
[3193.76 --> 3194.46]  I will give it
[3194.46 --> 3195.20]  to your descendants.
[3195.78 --> 3197.14]  I have let you see it
[3197.14 --> 3198.26]  with your eyes,
[3198.96 --> 3200.76]  but you will not
[3200.76 --> 3202.44]  cross over into it.
[3202.44 --> 3206.92]  And what's fascinating
[3206.92 --> 3209.32]  is we don't know
[3209.32 --> 3211.14]  how Moses responded
[3211.14 --> 3212.72]  to seeing the land
[3212.72 --> 3213.82]  but not being able
[3213.82 --> 3214.68]  to enter it.
[3215.56 --> 3216.08]  However,
[3216.90 --> 3217.86]  because if I'm reading
[3217.86 --> 3218.52]  that story,
[3218.66 --> 3219.04]  I'm like,
[3219.16 --> 3220.52]  that's pretty harsh, God.
[3221.32 --> 3222.60]  Why would you do this?
[3223.54 --> 3224.00]  However,
[3224.88 --> 3225.80]  we can assume
[3225.80 --> 3227.42]  that if Moses wanted
[3227.42 --> 3228.76]  to argue with God
[3228.76 --> 3229.36]  about that,
[3229.58 --> 3230.70]  we surely would have
[3230.70 --> 3231.54]  a record of it,
[3231.54 --> 3233.30]  but he didn't argue.
[3234.48 --> 3234.78]  Instead,
[3235.00 --> 3235.38]  there was even
[3235.38 --> 3236.48]  a sense of acceptance
[3236.48 --> 3238.66]  and even peace about this.
[3238.82 --> 3239.96]  And Moses' response
[3239.96 --> 3241.32]  to God here on the mountain,
[3241.56 --> 3242.30]  I think,
[3242.46 --> 3243.20]  stems directly
[3243.20 --> 3245.18]  from that crisis moment
[3245.18 --> 3247.18]  he had in Exodus 33.
[3248.06 --> 3248.76]  And so, church,
[3248.84 --> 3249.58]  I want to conclude
[3249.58 --> 3251.40]  with two final reflections
[3251.40 --> 3252.34]  from Moses' life
[3252.34 --> 3253.72]  and what that might mean
[3253.72 --> 3254.36]  for us,
[3254.48 --> 3255.32]  some invitations.
[3256.12 --> 3256.64]  So first,
[3256.70 --> 3257.02]  I want to talk
[3257.02 --> 3257.80]  about formation.
[3258.64 --> 3260.06]  Who you are becoming
[3260.06 --> 3261.58]  is the most important thing
[3261.58 --> 3262.74]  you and God
[3262.74 --> 3263.96]  get out of your life.
[3264.60 --> 3265.04]  And I want to talk
[3265.04 --> 3265.66]  about presence.
[3266.04 --> 3266.64]  God's presence
[3266.64 --> 3268.96]  is everything.
[3269.52 --> 3269.68]  Okay?
[3270.36 --> 3271.38]  So first,
[3271.74 --> 3272.30]  formation.
[3273.60 --> 3275.38]  At the end of your life,
[3275.52 --> 3277.02]  I believe God's not going
[3277.02 --> 3278.16]  to ask each of us,
[3278.40 --> 3279.64]  what great things
[3279.64 --> 3280.84]  did you do for me?
[3281.36 --> 3281.80]  But,
[3281.94 --> 3284.66]  who are you?
[3284.66 --> 3287.82]  And what kind of person
[3287.82 --> 3288.86]  did you become
[3288.86 --> 3291.08]  with the life I gave you?
[3292.46 --> 3293.88]  Because much like Moses
[3293.88 --> 3294.98]  and those who wander
[3294.98 --> 3295.92]  through the deserts,
[3295.92 --> 3297.32]  we can't carry much
[3297.32 --> 3298.20]  with us, huh?
[3298.92 --> 3299.50]  In fact,
[3299.60 --> 3301.10]  at the end of our days,
[3301.20 --> 3302.90]  we can't carry anything
[3302.90 --> 3303.66]  with us
[3303.66 --> 3305.24]  into the life to come
[3305.24 --> 3305.68]  except
[3305.68 --> 3308.24]  who we are,
[3308.74 --> 3310.44]  who we have become,
[3311.12 --> 3312.20]  our character.
[3312.20 --> 3314.06]  And so we discover
[3314.06 --> 3314.94]  throughout this wilderness
[3314.94 --> 3316.38]  journey that while we,
[3317.12 --> 3318.96]  or I really should say I,
[3319.08 --> 3319.76]  because I struggle
[3319.76 --> 3320.42]  so much with this,
[3320.76 --> 3322.58]  I prioritize results
[3322.58 --> 3324.70]  while God prioritizes character.
[3325.58 --> 3327.14]  I prioritize results
[3327.14 --> 3329.16]  while God prioritizes character.
[3329.72 --> 3330.52]  And just like there's
[3330.52 --> 3331.12]  no shortcut
[3331.12 --> 3332.06]  to the promised land
[3332.06 --> 3332.50]  of Canaan,
[3332.64 --> 3333.92]  there is no shortcut
[3333.92 --> 3334.92]  to becoming
[3334.92 --> 3337.02]  a mature person of God.
[3337.52 --> 3338.96]  A person above all
[3338.96 --> 3339.72]  of love,
[3340.22 --> 3340.64]  joy,
[3340.86 --> 3341.24]  peace,
[3341.24 --> 3342.98]  a person who surrenders
[3342.98 --> 3343.58]  their life
[3343.58 --> 3345.44]  into the formative hands
[3345.44 --> 3346.38]  of God.
[3346.46 --> 3347.42]  A person like Moses
[3347.42 --> 3349.34]  and a person like Jesus.
[3350.56 --> 3351.42]  So formation
[3351.42 --> 3353.64]  and also presence.
[3355.40 --> 3356.58]  Ruth Haley Barton,
[3356.70 --> 3357.56]  reflecting on the end
[3357.56 --> 3358.26]  of Moses' life,
[3358.32 --> 3359.44]  has this stunner
[3359.44 --> 3360.62]  of a line,
[3360.86 --> 3361.34]  which to me
[3361.34 --> 3362.26]  is worth the price
[3362.26 --> 3362.88]  of her book.
[3362.96 --> 3363.92]  I'm sorry to give it
[3363.92 --> 3364.56]  away to you,
[3364.84 --> 3365.64]  but it's a line
[3365.64 --> 3367.10]  I've carried in my soul
[3367.10 --> 3367.96]  all throughout
[3367.96 --> 3368.60]  this pandemic.
[3368.60 --> 3370.34]  And she writes
[3370.34 --> 3370.78]  this.
[3370.94 --> 3371.56]  Next slide.
[3373.02 --> 3373.82]  For Moses,
[3374.42 --> 3376.62]  God's presence
[3376.62 --> 3379.42]  is the promised land.
[3380.84 --> 3382.00]  For Moses,
[3382.76 --> 3384.00]  God's presence
[3384.00 --> 3387.04]  is the promised land.
[3388.04 --> 3389.08]  Come on now.
[3390.02 --> 3390.94]  Isn't that good?
[3390.94 --> 3395.64]  God is forming us
[3395.64 --> 3397.22]  through the crucibles
[3397.22 --> 3398.24]  and crises
[3398.24 --> 3399.30]  and finally
[3399.30 --> 3400.40]  the conclusion
[3400.40 --> 3401.88]  of our lives.
[3402.00 --> 3402.38]  However,
[3402.62 --> 3403.68]  whenever that comes,
[3403.68 --> 3404.96]  into people
[3404.96 --> 3406.10]  for whom
[3406.10 --> 3407.46]  the presence of God
[3407.46 --> 3409.68]  is the promised land.
[3410.50 --> 3411.58]  And this truth,
[3412.16 --> 3414.16]  it takes a long time,
[3414.32 --> 3415.00]  a lifetime
[3415.00 --> 3416.90]  of following God
[3416.90 --> 3418.20]  to fully sink in.
[3418.92 --> 3420.30]  And I wake up some days
[3420.30 --> 3420.94]  and I live
[3420.94 --> 3421.80]  as if it's true,
[3421.94 --> 3422.52]  but the majority
[3422.52 --> 3423.68]  of my days
[3423.68 --> 3424.50]  I don't.
[3425.04 --> 3425.76]  But I know
[3425.76 --> 3426.98]  God is patiently
[3426.98 --> 3428.28]  and persistently
[3428.28 --> 3429.30]  forming me
[3429.30 --> 3430.36]  into a person
[3430.36 --> 3430.84]  for whom
[3430.84 --> 3431.50]  this is more
[3431.50 --> 3432.34]  and more true
[3432.34 --> 3433.48]  and good.
[3433.90 --> 3434.54]  And I believe
[3434.54 --> 3436.12]  God invites all of us
[3436.12 --> 3437.44]  into this process.
[3438.30 --> 3438.74]  Many of you
[3438.74 --> 3440.18]  have experienced this,
[3440.30 --> 3441.50]  have followed God
[3441.50 --> 3442.48]  for a long time.
[3442.94 --> 3444.04]  You know that God
[3444.04 --> 3444.84]  invites us
[3444.84 --> 3445.98]  into this process
[3445.98 --> 3447.16]  as we deepen
[3447.16 --> 3448.56]  our life of prayer
[3448.56 --> 3449.82]  and surrender
[3449.82 --> 3450.98]  bit by bit
[3450.98 --> 3452.06]  every facet
[3452.06 --> 3452.90]  of our lives
[3452.90 --> 3454.02]  to our good God.
[3454.42 --> 3455.26]  This becomes
[3455.26 --> 3455.90]  true
[3455.90 --> 3457.10]  and good.
[3458.52 --> 3459.52]  So church,
[3459.66 --> 3460.88]  let me be very clear
[3460.88 --> 3461.40]  with you.
[3461.62 --> 3462.80]  The promised land
[3462.80 --> 3463.84]  is not
[3463.84 --> 3465.06]  that our province
[3465.06 --> 3465.86]  is reopening.
[3466.58 --> 3467.40]  The promised land
[3467.40 --> 3468.48]  is not that our churches
[3468.48 --> 3469.58]  are regathering.
[3470.14 --> 3470.76]  And it's not
[3470.76 --> 3471.70]  that next
[3471.70 --> 3472.82]  promotion
[3472.82 --> 3474.02]  or new business
[3474.02 --> 3475.70]  or future
[3475.70 --> 3478.02]  house
[3478.02 --> 3479.22]  or growing
[3479.22 --> 3480.06]  your influence
[3480.06 --> 3481.10]  or retirement
[3481.10 --> 3481.92]  or whatever
[3481.92 --> 3483.66]  you have placed
[3483.66 --> 3485.36]  as the promised land.
[3485.48 --> 3486.30]  We all know
[3486.30 --> 3487.08]  that even when
[3487.08 --> 3488.36]  we arrive there,
[3489.04 --> 3490.26]  we're still restless,
[3490.50 --> 3491.10]  aren't we?
[3491.38 --> 3492.64]  We keep chasing
[3492.64 --> 3494.10]  after the next thing.
[3494.78 --> 3495.68]  As the great
[3495.68 --> 3496.42]  Saint Augustine
[3496.42 --> 3497.26]  reminds us,
[3497.38 --> 3497.86]  our hearts
[3497.86 --> 3498.72]  are restless
[3498.72 --> 3500.10]  until they
[3500.10 --> 3501.40]  rest
[3501.40 --> 3502.40]  in
[3502.40 --> 3503.56]  God.
[3504.66 --> 3505.18]  So God's
[3505.18 --> 3505.70]  invitation
[3505.70 --> 3506.54]  to us
[3506.54 --> 3506.80]  is,
[3507.26 --> 3507.46]  will you
[3507.46 --> 3507.94]  continue
[3507.94 --> 3508.80]  to let me
[3508.80 --> 3509.66]  form you
[3509.66 --> 3510.98]  into a person
[3510.98 --> 3511.46]  for whom
[3511.46 --> 3512.28]  I will be
[3512.28 --> 3513.66]  your promised land?
[3513.88 --> 3515.28]  Come what may,
[3515.28 --> 3516.64]  will I be
[3516.64 --> 3517.46]  enough for you?
[3518.36 --> 3519.06]  And friends,
[3519.18 --> 3520.04]  I don't know
[3520.04 --> 3520.48]  what's going to
[3520.48 --> 3521.48]  happen in the future,
[3521.94 --> 3522.66]  but I do know
[3522.66 --> 3523.00]  there will be
[3523.00 --> 3523.96]  more crucibles
[3523.96 --> 3524.66]  and crises
[3524.66 --> 3525.44]  to come.
[3526.00 --> 3527.24]  Life is hard.
[3527.94 --> 3528.62]  Full stop.
[3529.22 --> 3529.96]  Life is hard.
[3530.90 --> 3531.78]  There could be
[3531.78 --> 3532.60]  another
[3532.60 --> 3533.92]  pandemic.
[3534.48 --> 3535.20]  We may have
[3535.20 --> 3535.88]  to do this
[3535.88 --> 3537.06]  thing all
[3537.06 --> 3538.66]  over again,
[3539.08 --> 3541.02]  but I also
[3541.02 --> 3541.38]  know
[3541.38 --> 3543.04]  God's presence
[3543.04 --> 3544.82]  is the
[3544.82 --> 3545.52]  promised land,
[3546.04 --> 3546.86]  and that is
[3546.86 --> 3547.30]  certain,
[3548.08 --> 3548.68]  and that is
[3548.68 --> 3549.38]  good news,
[3549.38 --> 3550.58]  and we can
[3550.58 --> 3551.86]  all start
[3551.86 --> 3553.20]  entering into
[3553.20 --> 3554.06]  that reality
[3554.06 --> 3555.88]  now.
[3555.88 --> 3557.94]  Amen?
[3559.94 --> 3560.76]  Let's turn
[3560.76 --> 3561.50]  our hearts
[3561.50 --> 3561.98]  to God
[3561.98 --> 3562.38]  in prayer,
[3562.50 --> 3562.88]  shall we?
[3562.96 --> 3563.48]  Let's pray.
[3564.80 --> 3565.76]  Gracious God,
[3566.70 --> 3567.62]  we've all
[3567.62 --> 3568.20]  been on a
[3568.20 --> 3568.54]  journey
[3568.54 --> 3570.14]  in this past
[3570.14 --> 3570.64]  year and a
[3570.64 --> 3571.00]  half,
[3571.06 --> 3571.76]  and it hasn't
[3571.76 --> 3572.28]  been easy.
[3572.40 --> 3572.64]  It's been
[3572.64 --> 3573.10]  downright
[3573.10 --> 3573.96]  exhausting,
[3574.62 --> 3575.48]  and often
[3575.48 --> 3575.96]  we're left
[3575.96 --> 3576.44]  restless
[3576.44 --> 3577.34]  and on edge
[3577.34 --> 3577.96]  at times
[3577.96 --> 3578.26]  with all
[3578.26 --> 3579.08]  this uncertainty
[3579.08 --> 3579.88]  and change,
[3580.00 --> 3581.02]  but come what
[3581.02 --> 3581.38]  may,
[3582.10 --> 3582.88]  as we continue
[3582.88 --> 3583.78]  on this
[3583.78 --> 3584.16]  journey
[3584.16 --> 3584.58]  through the
[3584.58 --> 3585.00]  wilderness
[3585.00 --> 3585.68]  and through
[3585.68 --> 3586.26]  exile,
[3586.72 --> 3587.24]  until you
[3587.24 --> 3587.64]  bring us
[3587.64 --> 3588.36]  home into
[3588.36 --> 3588.94]  the fullness
[3588.94 --> 3589.52]  of the
[3589.52 --> 3590.04]  life to
[3590.04 --> 3590.46]  come.
[3591.04 --> 3591.54]  Help us
[3591.54 --> 3592.14]  hear those
[3592.14 --> 3592.78]  words you
[3592.78 --> 3593.42]  spoke to
[3593.42 --> 3594.42]  Moses all
[3594.42 --> 3595.16]  those years
[3595.16 --> 3596.32]  ago and
[3596.32 --> 3596.84]  to us
[3596.84 --> 3597.38]  today.
[3598.18 --> 3598.92]  My presence
[3598.92 --> 3599.70]  will go
[3599.70 --> 3600.38]  with you,
[3600.98 --> 3601.68]  and I
[3601.68 --> 3602.22]  will give
[3602.22 --> 3602.86]  you rest.
[3603.36 --> 3604.36]  My presence
[3604.36 --> 3604.84]  will go
[3604.84 --> 3605.46]  with you,
[3605.66 --> 3606.72]  and I
[3606.72 --> 3607.26]  will give
[3607.26 --> 3608.06]  you rest.
[3608.36 --> 3609.26]  My presence
[3609.26 --> 3610.38]  will go
[3610.38 --> 3610.96]  with you,
[3611.68 --> 3612.48]  and I
[3612.48 --> 3613.34]  will give
[3613.34 --> 3614.00]  you rest.
[3614.16 --> 3615.90]  may this
[3615.90 --> 3616.60]  be so,
[3617.46 --> 3617.94]  and all
[3617.94 --> 3618.44]  of God's
[3618.44 --> 3619.20]  people said,
[3620.00 --> 3620.34]  Amen.
[3620.34 --> 3620.54]  Amen.
[3620.54 --> 3639.22]  Be still for the
[3639.22 --> 3640.72]  presence of the
[3640.72 --> 3642.16]  Lord, the
[3642.16 --> 3645.20]  Holy One is
[3645.20 --> 3646.20]  dear.
[3646.20 --> 3650.42]  Come bow
[3650.42 --> 3652.80]  before Him
[3652.80 --> 3654.24]  now with
[3654.24 --> 3657.16]  reverence and
[3657.16 --> 3659.46]  fear.
[3659.46 --> 3662.54]  In Him
[3662.54 --> 3664.82]  no sin is
[3664.82 --> 3666.32]  found.
[3667.08 --> 3669.34]  We stand on
[3669.34 --> 3672.26]  holy ground.
[3672.26 --> 3675.00]  be still for the
[3675.00 --> 3677.00]  presence of the
[3677.00 --> 3678.40]  Lord, the
[3678.40 --> 3681.50]  Holy One is
[3681.50 --> 3683.00]  here.
[3683.00 --> 3690.24]  Be still for the
[3690.24 --> 3691.82]  glory of the
[3691.82 --> 3694.22]  Lord is shining
[3694.22 --> 3697.42]  all around.
[3697.42 --> 3701.86]  He burns with
[3701.86 --> 3704.12]  holy fire,
[3704.12 --> 3706.12]  with splendor
[3706.12 --> 3707.60]  He is
[3707.60 --> 3710.12]  crowned.
[3710.12 --> 3711.82]  God
[3711.82 --> 3712.86]  how awesome is
[3712.86 --> 3713.86]  God
[3713.86 --> 3714.86]  how awesome is
[3714.86 --> 3716.72]  the sight,
[3716.72 --> 3718.86]  our radiant
[3718.86 --> 3721.86]  King of light.
[3721.86 --> 3724.86]  Be still for the
[3724.86 --> 3726.86]  glory of the
[3726.86 --> 3728.86]  Lord is shining
[3728.86 --> 3731.86]  all around.
[3731.86 --> 3737.56]  God
[3737.56 --> 3739.60]  be still for the
[3739.60 --> 3740.60]  power of the
[3740.60 --> 3741.76]  power of the
[3741.76 --> 3743.60]  Lord is moving
[3744.24 --> 3747.60]  in this place.
[3747.60 --> 3751.94]  He comes to
[3751.94 --> 3754.20]  cleanse and heal
[3754.20 --> 3757.94]  to minister His
[3757.94 --> 3759.60]  grace.
[3759.60 --> 3760.60]  grace.
[3760.60 --> 3763.88]  No work too
[3763.88 --> 3766.86]  hard for Him
[3766.86 --> 3769.02]  in faith
[3769.02 --> 3771.98]  receive from Him.
[3773.38 --> 3775.66]  Be still for the
[3775.66 --> 3777.22]  power of the
[3777.22 --> 3779.66]  Lord is moving
[3779.66 --> 3782.60]  in this place.
[3782.60 --> 3786.60]  forever.
[3786.60 --> 3814.24]  Let me now lead you in our congregational prayer.
[3816.60 --> 3823.10]  Almighty God, loving Father, we come to you this morning as your congregation.
[3823.10 --> 3828.78]  We come with sorrow and yet also with thankful hearts.
[3828.78 --> 3834.50]  We praise you for all you have made, all you have done for us, with our petitions and with
[3834.50 --> 3837.50]  thanksgiving.
[3837.50 --> 3840.16]  We thank you, Father, for this last week.
[3840.16 --> 3846.54]  You have kept us and provided for us in all our needs, especially the need of your Spirit.
[3846.54 --> 3852.82]  This morning you brought us together again in person and online so that we might worship
[3852.82 --> 3854.78]  you as one body.
[3854.78 --> 3856.94]  We thank you for this opportunity.
[3856.94 --> 3862.54]  For we know, Lord, that there are many of your children around the world who were not able
[3862.54 --> 3865.94]  to do this openly and in freedom.
[3865.94 --> 3868.94]  Be near them too.
[3868.94 --> 3873.22]  Each morning as we wake, we stand amazed at your creation.
[3873.22 --> 3879.44]  We hear the young crows calling for their food and it reminds us how you supply the needs
[3879.44 --> 3882.30]  of all you have made.
[3882.30 --> 3888.58]  Help us, Lord, to see your provision for our needs.
[3888.58 --> 3894.86]  This morning we pray especially for Janet Ram and all her dear ones, now that you've taken
[3894.86 --> 3896.86]  John to yourself.
[3896.86 --> 3898.86]  Comfort her, O Lord.
[3898.86 --> 3903.58]  Sustain her through all the demands of the next few weeks.
[3903.58 --> 3909.86]  Be also with Jerry and Anne Crane as they adapt to the new situation at Peace Portal.
[3909.86 --> 3916.26]  And Lord, there are many others among us who are struggling with illness and disability.
[3916.26 --> 3932.86]  Be with Joan and John Van Troll, Julie, Diane, Bernie, Mark, Pat, Greg, Annie, Andre, Shirley,
[3932.86 --> 3935.70]  and Grace.
[3935.70 --> 3941.02]  Many of us have lived in various care homes and there they've been isolated for a long
[3941.02 --> 3942.84]  time due to COVID.
[3942.84 --> 3950.10]  So we ask that you will be near them too, Cor and Hank and Carl and Hoda and Gert and Jeanette
[3950.10 --> 3954.42]  and Henry and Joyce.
[3954.42 --> 3960.62]  Lord, we lay our needs before you as a congregation.
[3960.62 --> 3964.86]  We bless the ministry of Jason and Nancy and Hannah among us.
[3964.86 --> 3969.64]  We as the deacons and elders as they go about their work.
[3969.64 --> 3974.46]  You have called them all to their respective tasks.
[3974.46 --> 3981.24]  And so we ask that you will also grant them all they need to do them well.
[3981.24 --> 3988.34]  But Lord, every last one of us has been called by you to labor in your kingdom.
[3988.34 --> 3992.38]  We all need your presence and your spirit.
[3992.38 --> 3996.52]  Grant us whatever we truly need.
[3996.52 --> 4001.72]  Lord, we pray for those who govern us.
[4001.72 --> 4007.04]  Be with Prime Minister Trudeau and the leader of the opposition, O'Toole.
[4007.04 --> 4012.46]  Be with our Premier Horgan, our mayor, and all who hold public office.
[4012.46 --> 4016.50]  They govern by your will.
[4016.50 --> 4025.64]  Grant them also the wisdom and the desire to do what is just and caring.
[4025.64 --> 4031.96]  Heavenly Father, we pray for this whole world, a world that is in your hands.
[4031.96 --> 4036.28]  We hear of earthquakes and fires, droughts and storms and flooding.
[4036.28 --> 4040.58]  There is war and famine.
[4040.58 --> 4043.88]  Cruelty and oppression prevails in many places.
[4043.88 --> 4050.66]  And COVID is rampant in much of the world with no end in sight.
[4050.66 --> 4058.04]  Tens of millions of refugees wander the world seeking a place to live.
[4058.04 --> 4062.14]  And yet, Lord, you are at work.
[4062.14 --> 4066.34]  Bless the work of those who aim to bring relief.
[4066.34 --> 4071.84]  Be with those who proclaim your love and tell of your salvation.
[4071.84 --> 4078.00]  Be with all our sisters and brothers around the world and guide us into being of one mind
[4078.00 --> 4086.42]  and one purpose so that your kingdom may come and your will be done in all the world.
[4086.42 --> 4093.64]  For that great day, Lord, when Jesus will return, we wait in hope.
[4093.64 --> 4096.96]  Hear these our prayers for his sake.
[4096.96 --> 4097.46]  Amen.
[4108.00 --> 4121.98]  Church, I invite you, if you're willing and able to stand, to receive God's blessing and
[4121.98 --> 4123.20]  then to close with song.
[4123.20 --> 4123.26]  Amen.
[4127.26 --> 4135.22]  People of God, you have been on a long journey, and it's not yet over.
[4135.22 --> 4141.94]  But may you receive whatever the Lord wants to teach you and form in you.
[4141.94 --> 4151.76]  May you come to trust in God's ways, to seek God's presence, to desire God's glory and goodness.
[4152.76 --> 4160.52]  And as you go forth into this week and the season ahead, may God's presence and grace and peace
[4160.52 --> 4164.64]  be with you every step of the way.
[4165.22 --> 4166.08]  Amen.
[4166.08 --> 4166.22]  Amen.
[4166.22 --> 4166.24]  Amen.
[4166.24 --> 4166.26]  Amen.
[4170.36 --> 4173.06]  Amen.
[4173.06 --> 4173.52]  Amen.
[4180.42 --> 4190.80]  Father, we love God, we worship and adore you.
[4190.80 --> 4199.22]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4199.22 --> 4204.98]  Glorify your name
[4204.98 --> 4209.58]  Glorify your name
[4209.58 --> 4217.64]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4217.64 --> 4224.14]  Jesus, we love you
[4224.14 --> 4229.10]  We worship and adore you
[4229.10 --> 4238.06]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4238.06 --> 4243.62]  Glorify your name
[4243.62 --> 4248.24]  Glorify your name
[4248.24 --> 4255.62]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4255.62 --> 4263.50]  Spirit, we love you
[4263.50 --> 4268.62]  We worship and adore you
[4268.62 --> 4277.62]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4277.62 --> 4283.62]  Glorify your name
[4283.62 --> 4288.62]  Glorify your name
[4288.62 --> 4296.62]  Glorify your name in all the earth
[4296.62 --> 4303.10]  Glorify your name
[4303.10 --> 4303.42]  Amen
[4303.42 --> 4305.54]  Amen
[4305.54 --> 4335.52]  Thank you.
[4335.54 --> 4365.52]  Thank you.
[4365.54 --> 4366.54]  Thank you.
