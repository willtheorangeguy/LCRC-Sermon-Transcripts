[246.00 → 260.00] Good morning and a blessed Easter to all on this beautiful day.
[260.00 → 268.00] Today at Ladder Christian Reformed Church, we have a very special service, and we are glad you have joined us.
[268.00 → 273.00] Even if only virtually to celebrate our risen Saviour.
[273.00 → 280.00] I am BEV Mantra and will be leading in worship and Pastor Jason will be opening God's word for us.
[280.00 → 291.00] Today's offering is for Resonate Global Mission, particularly for the ministry of Ajee Amman and Ann Zach in Cairo,
[291.00 → 295.00] where they witness in word and deed to our risen Saviour.
[295.00 → 305.00] Even on this day of resurrection, death remains the last enemy until Christ's return.
[305.00 → 317.00] We are grieved to announce that our sister in Christ, Kim Kulun, passed into the presence of Jesus on Friday evening with her husband at her side.
[317.00 → 329.00] Kim was the wife of George, our former associate pastor and a son of this church, and the daughter-in-law of Art and Wilma Kulun.
[329.00 → 334.00] Kim suffered greatly, but her struggle is now over.
[334.00 → 339.00] We will remember the family in our community prayer.
[339.00 → 347.00] Kim Our call to worship was written by Ann Liddell.
[347.00 → 351.76] We are not eyewitnesses to an event, as were Mary and the disciples.
[352.64 → 358.98] We have not journeyed through a dangerous city to seek answers or consolation.
[359.54 → 363.96] We have not seen angels gathered at the rim of this day,
[364.42 → 368.90] or wept in the garden this morning because we could not find him.
[370.06 → 375.94] But we are here to attest to a story that has not lost its power
[375.94 → 379.58] during 20 centuries of change and conflict.
[380.62 → 387.06] We are here because those before us carried this story as if it were precious gold,
[387.86 → 391.96] cherished it as if it were a key to hidden wisdom.
[393.16 → 399.64] Sisters and brothers in Christ, we gather virtually in celebration and in awe.
[400.78 → 405.50] What you are about to hear again has the capacity to change the world,
[405.94 → 411.58] we too witness the rising up of life from the tomb of despair
[411.58 → 415.30] and to the uncontrollable power of God.
[416.30 → 420.96] It is Easter morning again, and we will celebrate.

[728.38 → 734.46] We bless you for creating the whole world, for your promises to your people Israel and for
[734.46 → 739.58] the life we know in Jesus Christ your son.
[739.58 → 743.48] Even when we turned away from you, you never rejected us.
[743.48 → 748.80] You spoke words of mercy and love through the prophets, promising to swallow up death
[748.80 → 756.58] forever and to host a banquet for all people, a feast of life-giving sustenance.
[756.58 → 762.22] We praise you for Christ Jesus, your word incarnate made flesh.
[762.22 → 765.68] Born of Mary, he shares our life.
[765.68 → 769.42] Eating with sinners, he welcomes us.
[769.42 → 773.32] Leading his followers, he guides us.
[773.32 → 777.10] Dying on the cross, he rescues us.
[777.10 → 781.14] Risen from the dead, he gives new life.
[781.14 → 787.86] Most resilient God, source of all that is eternally raised up, we give you thanks for your unspeakable

[870.02 → 880.02] See God's salvation, God, God, in love, God, in pain, in a sacrifice.
[880.02 → 889.74] For faith in Christ and go, Lord, that he loves Christ is risen from the dead.
[891.08 → 895.76] See how good he feels, where is he laid?
[896.12 → 903.38] As the soul will launch, it turns from the empty doom, the ends of my sleep.
[903.38 → 911.24] All in redeeming is the master that all brings to life again
[911.24 → 916.22] The voice that spends the years

[1132.74 → 1134.74] Hi, my name is Leo.
[1134.74 → 1137.74] I was born and raised in mainland China.
[1137.74 → 1141.74] I came to Canada in 2008 for university at UBC.
[1141.74 → 1144.74] And I live in Vancouver since then.
[1144.74 → 1148.74] I have a family of four with my wife and our two young boys.
[1148.74 → 1150.74] We're a happy family.
[1150.74 → 1154.74] And I always believed it was not me that chose to believe in God.
[1154.74 → 1156.74] It's God that chose me.
[1156.74 → 1163.74] You know, I joined UBC Christian Student Club on the first day of the school during the club day.
[1163.74 → 1170.74] And I also made my commitment to God, you know, right at the booth with the club members on that day.
[1170.74 → 1175.74] Although I didn't even know what that really mean at the time.
[1175.74 → 1183.74] So I believe it's not a coincidence for Chinese international students to join a Christian Student Club on the first day of the school.
[1183.74 → 1185.74] And I believe it was God's will.
[1185.74 → 1191.74] And, you know, as I learn more story about the Lord and I go to church more often.
[1191.74 → 1194.74] And also a lot of our friends are Christians.
[1194.74 → 1201.74] And later on, we got connected to my wife with Nancy and Stephen.
[1201.74 → 1209.74] So we learn more about God from going to church and listen to, you know, the sessions they hold.
[1209.74 → 1215.74] And, you know, the more I know, the more I believe.
[1215.74 → 1227.74] And looking back all these years, I believe God has, you know, showed his love to me in a lot of different ways, including my school, my job and my family.
[1227.74 → 1233.74] And, you know, I do believe he truly is the saviour for us.
[1233.74 → 1241.74] And my favourite verse is the Ecclesiastes 311.
[1241.74 → 1245.74] He has made everything beautiful in its time.
[1245.74 → 1248.74] He has also set eternity in the human heart.
[1248.74 → 1253.74] Yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
[1253.74 → 1257.74] And this verse is kind of enlightened me.
[1257.74 → 1267.74] You know, over the time, I sometimes hear people questioning about God's story, about the Bible.
[1267.74 → 1277.74] So it was one of they're always trying to make sense of it, out of it, no matter is from experience or from, you know, science.
[1277.74 → 1292.74] They don't believe it unless it's kind of make a scientific sense in a lot of ways to me, as he says in this verse, no human being can fathom what God has done from the beginning to end, because he's the God.
[1292.74 → 1300.74] We're just human. He's the creator. We can't, you know, he's no matter whether we believe in him or not, he's always there.
[1300.74 → 1304.74] And he has his reasons for doing things.
[1304.74 → 1311.74] It's like kids sometimes won't understand what why the parents would stop them from doing something or ask them to do something.
[1311.74 → 1313.74] It's the same thing here.
[1313.74 → 1316.74] And that's why he wanted us to go back to him.
[1316.74 → 1322.74] And he sent his only son Jesus to save us to lead us.
[1322.74 → 1333.74] And what we need to do is just to, you know, accept him and, you know, go back to him and follow his lead.
[1333.74 → 1337.74] Then we will be saved by the end of the day.
[1337.74 → 1346.74] I'm Sienna.
[1346.74 → 1347.74] I was born in China.
[1347.74 → 1348.74] I was born in China.
[1348.74 → 1350.74] I was born in Canada.
[1350.74 → 1353.74] I have a happy house of four of us.
[1353.74 → 1357.74] I have a mother and a wife.
[1357.74 → 1358.74] I was a daughter.
[1358.74 → 1361.74] I was born in the church.
[1361.74 → 1366.74] There are many spirits that have never had any kind of behaviours out there.
[1366.74 → 1370.74] And I courts bitterness ofibwolf in a pastor about him.
[1370.74 → 1372.74] There are world people.
[1372.74 → 1373.74] Half pressed down...
[1373.74 → 1376.74] Then there are different people who have been sf advised and received word from I.
[1376.74 → 1377.74] Come to get ski out here, and I'm still felt.
[1377.74 → 1380.74] This is a great experience.
[1380.74 → 1385.74] Later to Canada, I met many siblings and siblings.
[1385.74 → 1392.74] They also gave me a story, and they gave me a story, and they gave me a story.
[1392.74 → 1403.74] They gave me a story, and they gave me a story, and they gave me a story.
[1403.74 → 1406.74] Then I started to get to the story of the Christian.
[1406.74 → 1412.74] Then I met Steven, and I was my art teacher, and Steven's wife Nancy.
[1412.74 → 1424.74] Then we had a chance to teach the Bible, and then after Covid, we were still on the internet with Nancy and Steven.
[1424.74 → 1430.74] We were still in a certain time to listen to the Bible, and to pray.
[1430.74 → 1436.74] Then my brother, my big brother, he started to graduate.
[1436.74 → 1441.74] I talked to my teacher, and I said he wanted to study in the.
[1441.74 → 1453.74] He wanted to be a love person, and he wanted to study in the school.
[1453.74 → 1467.74] We wanted to study in the school, and to get to read the Bible, and to feel the Bible.
[1467.74 → 1474.74] I said that I like the most of the words, actually is the book of the book of the book.
[1474.74 → 1476.74] The book of the book, you must be in the book.
[1476.74 → 1479.74] The book of the kingdom, and the kingdom of the kingdom, and the kingdom of the kingdom.
[1479.74 → 1481.74] These things are to be added to you.
[1481.74 → 1483.74] So, don't be afraid of tomorrow.
[1483.74 → 1486.74] Because tomorrow, there is a day of tomorrow.
[1486.74 → 1489.74] One day of the, one day of the, one day of the, one day of the.
[1489.74 → 1500.74] This sentence means my heart felt the greatest thinking one.
[1500.74 → 1507.74] I heard this word when I heard this word, I felt a bit of excitement.
[1507.74 → 1510.74] I thought I had a lot of attention to myself.
[1510.74 → 1517.74] I also had a job, so I thought I had a lot of things that I had to do with God.
[1517.74 → 1521.74] It is true that you don't want to worry tomorrow.
[1521.74 → 1525.74] Because tomorrow, God knows you need something.
[1525.74 → 1530.74] He drinks government or inspires you any Sign деле.
[1530.74 → 1537.74] There is a girl showing wings, giving You just fine things to yourself and handle your dogs.
[1537.74 → 1543.74] They cannot save you so much to do it.
[1543.74 → 1548.74] Did I feel it, seeing God still love me, beingelypowered,
[1548.74 → 1550.74] Iran Multiplayer, trust me and assets,
[1550.74 → 1553.78] and also diagnosing Delta Christian school.
[1553.90 → 1557.22] I think this all is...
[1557.46 → 1559.92] the God obsessed with us,
[1559.92 → 1574.52] би
[1578.56 → 1580.20] 안끈
[1580.74 → 1590.42] And so you all have just gotten a chance to meet Leo and Sienna, and here are their two children.
[1590.72 → 1595.82] This is Adam and Jasper, and their whole family today is going to be baptized.
[1595.82 → 1603.56] So it's a very exciting day, and we praise the Lord for what he has done in their lives to bring them to this point.
[1605.40 → 1609.82] And so I will say a few words about baptism for us.
[1611.64 → 1615.22] So Jesus, in the Gospel of Matthew, says this,
[1616.22 → 1619.62] All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1620.40 → 1628.16] Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[1628.86 → 1631.44] and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[1631.88 → 1635.60] And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[1636.46 → 1637.68] That's the one thing you shouldn't do.
[1640.74 → 1644.22] They can wander around, but...
[1646.22 → 1647.84] Okay.
[1648.56 → 1650.38] So he's going to stick his finger in the light socket.
[1650.88 → 1651.10] Okay.
[1651.70 → 1653.24] So for those who can't see on camera.
[1653.24 → 1654.26] All right.
[1654.32 → 1660.14] And so baptism is a sign and seal of God's promise to his covenant people.
[1661.04 → 1668.38] In baptism, God promises by grace alone to forgive our sins, to adopt us into the body of Christ's church,
[1668.42 → 1670.18] and to resurrect us to eternal life.
[1670.78 → 1673.60] And then this promise is made visible in the waters of baptism.
[1673.60 → 1683.08] Also, through baptism, God calls us to love and trust God completely, to forsake the evil of the world,
[1683.58 → 1687.30] and to live a new and holy life by the power of his grace at work within us.
[1689.08 → 1692.08] And so, Leo and Sienna, you have come today...
[1692.08 → 1694.08] I can't keep my mask on...
[1694.72 → 1701.78] To publicly profess your faith in the Lord Jesus and to receive the sacrament of baptism.
[1702.64 → 1709.50] So I'm going to ask you a couple questions before God and before this church to profess your faith in Christ.
[1710.44 → 1711.54] And so, here are the questions.
[1711.66 → 1716.28] Do you renounce sin and the power of evil in your life and in the world?
[1717.16 → 1718.02] Do you renounce sin?
[1718.02 → 1720.58] Who is your Lord and Saviour?
[1721.32 → 1723.10] Jesus Christ is our Lord and Saviour.
[1723.42 → 1727.86] And will you be a faithful member of this congregation and through worship and service,
[1728.44 → 1731.62] seek to advance God's kingdom here and throughout the world?
[1732.02 → 1732.68] We will.
[1733.60 → 1734.20] Great.
[1734.56 → 1734.84] Okay.
[1735.10 → 1738.44] So let's pray and ask for God's blessing upon our time now.
[1739.68 → 1742.90] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gift of baptism.
[1742.90 → 1748.02] In this water, you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death.
[1748.66 → 1750.70] We are raised to share in his resurrection.
[1751.44 → 1754.26] And we are being renewed by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1754.94 → 1759.10] We ask that you would send your Holy Spirit upon Leo and Sienna and their children,
[1759.88 → 1763.64] that this water may be a spring gushing up to eternal life.
[1764.46 → 1769.38] Wash away their sin, raise them to new life, and enfold them into your body, the church.
[1769.94 → 1771.42] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1772.02 → 1772.44] Amen.
[1772.90 → 1773.34] Amen.
[1774.54 → 1775.26] Okay.
[1775.40 → 1775.70] So.
[1778.64 → 1780.44] We'll have the pillows.
[1781.30 → 1782.06] Kneel.
[1783.72 → 1785.24] And we just do, yeah.
[1785.62 → 1785.94] That's great.
[1793.52 → 1794.24] Okay.
[1794.68 → 1795.02] So.
[1796.22 → 1800.08] Leo, I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[1800.08 → 1800.72] Amen.
[1800.72 → 1801.52] Amen.
[1801.52 → 1802.46] And of the Father.
[1804.54 → 1805.38] And of the Father.
[1806.10 → 1806.66] Amen.
[1808.66 → 1809.70] Daddy's wet.
[1809.70 → 1822.42] Sienna, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1823.42 → 1824.02] Amen.
[1829.08 → 1830.72] I've got one you can share.
[1831.36 → 1832.58] I'll give it to you first.
[1834.16 → 1835.74] So you may stand.
[1839.70 → 1840.02] Great.
[1840.48 → 1846.88] And so the next thing is that Leo and Sienna would like to also have their children baptized.
[1847.84 → 1853.94] And so there are some other vows that they will say, and there's some additional explanation that needs to be given.
[1854.98 → 1863.00] God says in Genesis, I will establish my covenant between you, me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations
[1863.00 → 1868.44] for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
[1868.44 → 1877.90] And so God graciously includes our children in the covenant, and all of his promises are for us as well as them.
[1878.80 → 1887.16] So just as in the Old Testament, God's people receive the sign of circumcision, and so in the same way, our children are given the sign of baptism.
[1887.16 → 1893.84] So we are therefore to teach our little ones that they have been set apart in baptism as God's own children.
[1894.74 → 1899.42] So I'll ask you just these two questions now, and they're kind of like vows, promises that you will make.
[1900.54 → 1908.28] Well, first, do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature, are received by God in Christ as members of his covenant,
[1908.28 → 1910.40] and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1911.48 → 1912.32] We do.
[1912.96 → 1917.50] And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of this Christian community
[1917.50 → 1921.78] to do all in your power to instruct these children in the Christian faith
[1921.78 → 1926.12] and to lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1927.56 → 1928.04] Okay.
[1928.84 → 1930.44] So, are you ready, Adam?
[1931.34 → 1932.18] Okay, come on.
[1932.18 → 1932.20] Come on.
[1932.20 → 1932.24] Come on.
[1932.24 → 1934.24] Come on.
[1934.24 → 1935.24] Come on.
[1935.24 → 1936.24] Come on.
[1936.24 → 1937.24] Come on.
[1937.24 → 1938.24] Come on.
[1938.28 → 1940.82] Okay.
[1941.06 → 1941.30] Adam.
[1942.08 → 1942.72] Ready?
[1943.06 → 1943.74] You stay with me.
[1944.20 → 1944.40] Ready?
[1945.18 → 1949.62] Adam, for you, Jesus came into this world.
[1950.46 → 1951.46] For you, he died.
[1952.42 → 1954.22] For you, he rose again.
[1954.74 → 1957.50] And he did this for you because he loves you.
[1958.42 → 1966.38] So, Adam, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son.
[1966.38 → 1969.32] And of the Holy Spirit.
[1969.32 → 1971.32] Amen.
[1971.32 → 1978.06] And Jasper, I baptize you.
[1978.56 → 1979.66] He doesn't like water.
[1979.66 → 1985.94] In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1985.94 → 1986.94] Good job.
[1986.94 → 1987.08] Good job.
[1987.08 → 1987.74] You did it.
[1987.74 → 1987.94] Amen.
[1987.94 → 1988.54] Amen.
[1988.54 → 1989.82] Amen.
[1989.82 → 1990.02] Amen.
[1990.02 → 1993.22] Thank you.
[1993.22 → 2003.08] So, in the name of Jesus Christ, the only king and head of the church, Leo, Sienna, Adam,
[2003.08 → 2007.54] and Jasper have been received into the membership of the church.
[2007.54 → 2012.16] They have been sealed by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ's own forever.
[2012.92 → 2014.28] And so, let's pray.
[2015.12 → 2015.46] Adam.
[2016.20 → 2016.50] Adam.
[2018.30 → 2018.86] Adam.
[2019.82 → 2020.24] Adam.
[2020.24 → 2020.36] Adam.
[2020.36 → 2025.24] Here, can you pray with me?
[2025.68 → 2025.90] Ready?
[2026.00 → 2026.28] Let's pray.
[2026.36 → 2026.74] Do this.
[2027.64 → 2027.86] Okay.
[2028.12 → 2028.32] Ready?
[2029.10 → 2033.74] Gracious God, we thank you that you cleanse and renew us daily by your grace alone.
[2034.40 → 2038.28] We pray that you would bless and strengthen this family daily with the gift of your Holy
[2038.28 → 2038.58] Spirit.
[2039.72 → 2041.30] Would you teach them your love?
[2041.42 → 2045.30] Would you help them to keep them from the power of evil?
[2046.02 → 2048.30] Would you enable them to live a holy life for you?
[2048.30 → 2053.38] And, Father, give them also your presence and your help as they raise up these children
[2053.38 → 2055.46] to know you and love you and serve you.
[2055.82 → 2056.98] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2057.30 → 2057.56] Amen.
[2058.72 → 2059.22] High five.
[2060.50 → 2061.06] Good job.
[2062.18 → 2062.42] Okay.
[2063.52 → 2063.94] All right.
[2065.58 → 2066.24] So, let's...
[2066.24 → 2066.58] Yes.
[2068.86 → 2071.68] Oh, and we have some presents for you.
[2072.36 → 2072.88] Yeah.
[2073.34 → 2074.24] Because it's Easter.
[2074.24 → 2074.32] Easter.
[2074.32 → 2078.40] Okay.
[2079.32 → 2079.88] Ready?
[2080.08 → 2082.16] Jasper, this one is for you.
[2082.78 → 2083.54] Thank you.
[2084.12 → 2086.40] And there's a Bible for you.
[2086.54 → 2087.06] Thank you.
[2087.10 → 2087.66] You're welcome.
[2090.00 → 2091.48] Can I read it?
[2091.84 → 2092.10] Yes.
[2092.78 → 2093.58] Here's a Bible.
[2093.96 → 2094.34] Thank you.
[2094.74 → 2095.46] Here's your certificate.
[2096.10 → 2097.26] And this is for you.
[2097.26 → 2098.26] Thank you.
[2098.26 → 2098.60] Yes.
[2098.60 → 2098.78] Okay.
[2098.78 → 2107.52] Here you go.
[2107.58 → 2108.66] And Jasper, this is for you too.
[2109.14 → 2110.36] But you can give it to your mom if you want.
[2111.16 → 2111.44] Okay.
[2111.92 → 2112.28] All right.
[2112.44 → 2112.84] Thank you.
[2112.84 → 2113.54] Thank you.
[2113.54 → 2114.44] Thank you.
[2114.44 → 2119.44] Oh
[2134.48 → 2142.48] I
[2142.48 → 2143.12] quite though
[2172.48 → 2174.48] me
[2179.68 → 2183.68] Oh
[2202.48 → 2216.30] I'm forgiven
[2216.30 → 2221.30] Because you have received me
[2221.30 → 2224.28] I'm accepted
[2224.28 → 2228.74] You will let me die
[2228.74 → 2233.16] I'm alive and alive
[2233.16 → 2237.00] And here it is within me
[2237.00 → 2242.40] You know I can see a time of sleep
[2242.40 → 2248.18] Amazing love
[2248.18 → 2252.26] You know I can't believe
[2252.26 → 2255.72] And to my faith
[2255.72 → 2258.26] I'll die for the pain
[2258.26 → 2264.56] Amazing love
[2264.56 → 2267.78] My love is true
[2267.78 → 2273.68] It's my joy to honour you
[2273.68 → 2278.10] You know I do
[2278.10 → 2282.62] I honour you
[2282.62 → 2287.62] I honour you
[2287.62 → 2292.14] I'm alive, and I can't believe
[2292.14 → 2299.14] Jesus you are my king
[2299.14 → 2306.14] Jesus you are my king
[2306.14 → 2312.44] Amazing love
[2312.44 → 2314.44] Amazing love
[2314.44 → 2318.96] I'm alive, and I can't believe
[2318.96 → 2320.74] I can't believe
[2320.74 → 2323.02] I can't believe
[2323.02 → 2323.96] I can't believe
[2323.96 → 2324.96] I can't believe
[2324.96 → 2326.26] Amazing love
[2326.26 → 2328.38] Amazing love
[2328.38 → 2331.26] My love is true
[2331.26 → 2335.78] He is my joy to honour you
[2335.78 → 2338.44] He's my joy to honour you
[2338.44 → 2342.78] You know I do
[2342.78 → 2360.80] I know you
[2360.80 → 2362.18] I nominate him
[2362.18 → 2369.14] So I'm moving over just a bit with the hopes that you will be able to see this beautiful cross
[2369.14 → 2376.46] that is behind us, and it looks amazing. So today as Christians, we get to celebrate what is,
[2376.46 → 2383.90] without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest day in all history. This is the day, Easter,
[2383.90 → 2393.48] that gives meaning to every other day of our lives. This is the day that gives us hope in the
[2393.48 → 2399.52] midst of every circumstance that we find ourselves in, and it gives us joy in the midst of the pain
[2399.52 → 2406.16] that we sometimes experience. We can get out of bed every morning because on this day, nearly 2,000
[2406.16 → 2413.20] years ago, Jesus got out of the grave. And there's hardly a better passage to look at this and
[2413.20 → 2420.36] understand this than 1 Corinthians 15. This is perhaps the earliest Christian meditation
[2420.36 → 2426.94] on the resurrection of Jesus. It's found in the Bible. It's written in the first century by the
[2426.94 → 2433.50] Apostle Paul to a church in the city of Corinth in what is modern-day Greece. And it was written
[2433.50 → 2442.90] to the church to remind them and to remind us that death will be destroyed because Jesus, who had died,
[2443.20 → 2450.18] rose again. So let us open this passage together. We will have it up on the screen for you.
[2451.14 → 2452.36] And this is God's word.
[2453.36 → 2460.60] For what I received, I passed on to you as a first importance, that Christ died for our sins according
[2460.60 → 2467.58] to the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures.
[2467.58 → 2474.90] But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[2475.66 → 2481.62] For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
[2482.28 → 2489.60] For as in Adam all die, so in Christ will all be made alive. But each in turn, Christ the first fruits,
[2489.60 → 2498.16] then when he comes, those who belong to him. Then the end will come when he hands over the kingdom
[2498.16 → 2505.30] to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power. For he must reign
[2505.30 → 2511.54] until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
[2511.54 → 2520.22] Listen, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed in a flash,
[2520.28 → 2526.96] in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised
[2526.96 → 2533.46] imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable,
[2533.90 → 2540.12] and the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable,
[2540.12 → 2545.30] and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true.
[2546.00 → 2552.80] Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?
[2553.18 → 2561.34] The sting of death is sin. The power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God. He gives us the victory
[2561.34 → 2567.16] through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm.
[2567.16 → 2574.08] Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know
[2574.08 → 2582.68] that your labour in the Lord is not in vain. Friends, this is God's word. It is absolutely true,
[2582.98 → 2591.14] and he gives it to us in his love for us. So would you pray with me as we come before the Lord in his
[2591.14 → 2598.76] word together? Father, we thank you again for the new life that we've witnessed in baptism.
[2599.64 → 2605.78] We thank you for this life that was made possible because today Jesus is alive. He has risen from
[2605.78 → 2613.62] the grave. So Lord, we pray that you would also make us alive continually in you through the power
[2613.62 → 2619.80] of your Holy Spirit work within us, illuminating to us, Lord, what you would have to teach us,
[2619.96 → 2623.16] and what it means to follow you. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2625.52 → 2630.60] The hope of Easter is that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, death will finally be destroyed.
[2631.74 → 2636.26] So we're going to look at these verses this morning, and we're going to see two kinds of death
[2636.26 → 2644.64] that are destroyed in Jesus' death and resurrection. And I think that as when we see this,
[2645.70 → 2652.70] that it will fuel us with a sense of hope and joy this morning. And hopefully it will then empower us
[2652.70 → 2660.84] also to change and to live differently in our lives now. So the first kind of death, the first point,
[2660.84 → 2667.50] the first kind of death that Jesus' resurrection destroys is the destiny of death. And that is to say,
[2668.42 → 2677.78] Jesus destroyed the death of our own individual lives. The Bible teaches us that way back in the
[2677.78 → 2686.10] beginning that we were not made to die. God made us to live. He made us to live in what the Bible calls
[2686.10 → 2695.60] shalom. It's this wholeness and joy that God created the world to be like, where we would have
[2695.60 → 2700.90] this perfect relationship with God, with ourselves, with others, and in the world. It was this whole
[2700.90 → 2708.44] beautiful life that God made and that he gave to us. But the Bible also teaches us that we rejected God.
[2708.44 → 2718.66] We sinned against him, and we turned our lives away from this wholeness of shalom towards a life of
[2718.66 → 2725.20] suffering and death. And now as a result, we are separated from God. We are estranged from him.
[2725.74 → 2733.68] We have disordered hearts. We have broken bodies. We have broken relationships. Furthermore, we live in a corrupted
[2733.68 → 2742.24] world that eventually ends in death. But God, because he loves you, because he loves this whole world,
[2742.60 → 2750.06] he promised to come and deliver us from this captivity to death. And in many ways, the story of
[2750.06 → 2757.00] the entire Bible is the story of that deliverance. So when we read the Old Testament, we see God
[2757.00 → 2762.88] again and again destroying the things that bring death to his people. So we see right in the beginning,
[2762.88 → 2770.90] God comes to Adam and Eve, and he clothes them in their shame. And then we see with Abraham and Sarah,
[2771.10 → 2782.28] God giving them a child in their barrenness. We see God's people enslaved in Egypt. We see God
[2782.28 → 2790.48] delivering them out of slavery. We see God's people continually struggling with their own guilt and
[2790.48 → 2798.10] failure. But God cleansing them of their guilt and condemnation through sacrifice. And then we see
[2798.10 → 2807.52] as Israel is led into exile, we see God returning his people back again. Over and over, this is the
[2807.52 → 2813.28] story that we see in the Bible of God rescuing and delivering his people from sin, from suffering,
[2813.28 → 2819.98] from death. But friends, it's not until the New Testament that we actually see the fullness of
[2819.98 → 2827.92] this in Jesus Christ. Because on the cross, his own death, the death of Jesus, removes our death
[2827.92 → 2834.74] and our condemnation. And his resurrection that we celebrate this morning removes death itself.
[2834.74 → 2842.80] In Jesus Christ, God has destroyed once and for all the sin and death for his people. And the reason
[2842.80 → 2849.44] why we need to understand this story is that this is the story that Paul is telling to the church in
[2849.44 → 2855.90] Corinth and that he is telling us today. So if you look at me with me at verse 21, this is what Paul
[2855.90 → 2864.68] says, for since death came through a man, that is Adam, the resurrection of the dead comes also through
[2864.68 → 2873.00] a man. As in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. What he's saying is, I want you to
[2873.00 → 2880.16] understand that this death that Adam has brought to each of us, because we are, Adam is our federal head
[2880.16 → 2888.16] and we are in Adam, so we are also subject to death, to weakness, to sin and suffering. But now Christ,
[2888.84 → 2895.80] the new Adam, is undoing all of that. He is bringing about resurrection. So then look at verse 20,
[2896.02 → 2903.88] right before this one. Paul says, Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those
[2903.88 → 2910.74] who have fallen asleep. So look, Paul uses this imagery of the first fruits of the resurrection.
[2911.46 → 2916.44] And there are two aspects of this image that are really important for us to understand.
[2916.84 → 2923.24] The first, it means that Jesus is the promised pledge of more to come, right? Jesus is like this
[2923.24 → 2931.94] first flower that pops up in our gardens in spring. And he says, all the rest of us are also going to
[2931.94 → 2938.80] flower up. We're all going to. It's just, he is the first one, and then we see a whole garden of flowers
[2938.80 → 2946.24] rising up. The second, the first fruits aren't only a promise of more to come, but it also shows us
[2946.24 → 2954.10] the quality of what is to come. In other words, Jesus is this beautiful flower, and we are going to be
[2954.10 → 2958.68] just like it. It's going to be more of the same. It's going to be a field full of beautiful tulips.
[2958.68 → 2966.12] Our resurrection bodies will be like his resurrection body. That's what Jesus promises us.
[2967.06 → 2974.52] And in this passage, if you look at verses 51 to 53, you will see how Paul describes this
[2974.52 → 2980.84] resurrection body. He says, listen, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be
[2980.84 → 2986.22] changed. In a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound,
[2986.22 → 2991.28] the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. And then listen to this,
[2991.84 → 2998.74] for the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, the mortal with immortality.
[2999.36 → 3005.94] So what's Paul saying here? He's telling us that our future resurrection bodies, right, because we
[3005.94 → 3010.40] believe in the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting, as the Apostles' Creed says,
[3010.40 → 3018.56] that these resurrection bodies will be imperishable and immortal. That's hard for us to even imagine,
[3018.66 → 3025.46] isn't it? But this means that unlike our bodies now, there will be no more death. There will be no
[3025.46 → 3032.86] more decay. There will be no more sickness. There'll be nothing wrong. We will have these strong
[3032.86 → 3042.10] bodies that will not age, will not break down, because Christ has pierced through death, right?
[3042.14 → 3050.18] This barrier of death that no man or woman has ever been able to get through, Christ has broken
[3050.18 → 3057.40] through. He has torn it apart. He has come right through it. And so everything that is true about Jesus,
[3057.40 → 3067.24] right, his own moral purity, his resurrection body, his unconquerable life, that will be given to you as
[3067.24 → 3075.42] well. All of us who belong to him. Death has been swallowed up in victory, right? And that means,
[3075.54 → 3081.36] friends, that the sin that we struggle with, that always seems to plague us, that we're always fighting
[3081.36 → 3090.54] against. In the end, it cannot win. The cancer that you have, that many of us are sick with, it can't
[3090.54 → 3098.20] win. It can't ultimately win. Even your death can't win over you, because Jesus has conquered death.
[3099.62 → 3106.02] Paul says, where, oh death, is your victory? Where, oh death, is your sting? What's he doing there?
[3106.02 → 3114.80] In the NFL, you'd get a penalty for that. That's called taunting. He's taunting death, because death
[3114.80 → 3123.60] is powerless. If you belong to Christ by faith, Jesus promises that your sins are forgiven,
[3124.18 → 3132.78] that your life with God is sure, and your future is glorious. Your sin and death have been destroyed
[3132.78 → 3141.14] by the resurrection of Jesus. But there's another thing that we see here. There's another death that
[3141.14 → 3147.94] Jesus has come to destroy. And it's not just our individual deaths, but secondly, it's the dominion
[3147.94 → 3153.76] and rule of death over all of God's world. This is the second thing that Paul is talking about in this
[3153.76 → 3158.62] passage, and I think that when we see it, we will see that it is glorious and that it is beautiful.
[3158.62 → 3165.38] And to understand this again, we have to go back to the beginning. When God made the world,
[3166.48 → 3174.86] everything was ordered for God's glory. Everything was under his authority. Everything was in subjection
[3174.86 → 3181.44] to him as the creator and Lord of all things. And then when he made us, when he made human beings,
[3181.44 → 3190.80] he made us not only to enjoy the shalom, this beautiful creation, he also made us to extend shalom.
[3191.46 → 3198.24] Our calling as human beings was to extend God's rule of wholeness and goodness into the whole world.
[3199.46 → 3207.66] But what happened? We rebelled against God. And when we did, the entire world fell under the curse of sin.
[3207.66 → 3215.94] And so now this world that was once completely ordered towards God's glory is now under the dominion
[3215.94 → 3223.22] in the reign of sin and death. And so now also for us, instead of us cultivating a fruitful garden,
[3223.92 → 3232.30] our work in the world is filled with frustration and futility and failure. Sometimes it feels like our
[3232.30 → 3237.14] work in the world doesn't bring any fruitfulness at all. Instead, we're just growing thorns.
[3237.66 → 3245.62] But God loves this world, and he promised that he is going to destroy the dominion of death over it.
[3246.32 → 3251.98] And so it's not just our own death, the death of our own individual lives, but he's going to destroy
[3251.98 → 3258.22] the reign of death in the world. The Bible shows us again and again that this is going to happen.
[3258.22 → 3266.72] Think back to Adam and Eve. Not only did God clothe Adam and Eve in their shame, he called them back
[3266.72 → 3275.16] to the work that he gave them to do in the world. Right? God didn't just give Abraham and Sarah
[3275.16 → 3282.12] a child. He called them to be the parents of a whole new humanity.
[3282.12 → 3290.12] When he rescued Israel from slavery, he didn't just rescue them, he called them then to be
[3290.12 → 3295.96] a light to the nations. When he cleanses people from their sin, he didn't simply take their sin away.
[3296.44 → 3302.06] He called them to go and live according to righteousness. And when he brought back Israel
[3302.06 → 3309.30] from exile, he gave them the job of rebuilding the city of God. Right? Over and over again in the Bible,
[3309.30 → 3315.82] God is calling his people to work in this world for his kingdom, even in the midst of frustration.
[3316.98 → 3322.60] But again, it's not until the New Testament that we actually see the fullness of this in Jesus Christ.
[3323.44 → 3330.88] Jesus comes into the world and what does he start doing? He takes the sickness that he sees that we
[3330.88 → 3339.28] suffer with, and he brings health and healing. He finds us in our sin, and he forgives
[3339.28 → 3346.66] our sin, and he says, go and sin no more. He finds us in our blindness, and he gives us sight and teaches
[3346.66 → 3352.36] us the truth. He finds the outcasts and all those who are excluded, and he befriends them.
[3352.92 → 3358.82] And he makes dead people come alive again. Right? He's taking everything in all of this
[3358.82 → 3364.72] world that God has made, and he is reordering it and restoring it. And he says,
[3364.72 → 3369.04] the kingdom of God is coming. He is ushering in the kingdom of God.
[3370.52 → 3376.54] This is, friends, this is also what Paul is talking about in this passage. So look with me at verse 24.
[3379.70 → 3386.82] Then the end will come when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed
[3386.82 → 3393.94] all dominion and authority and power. Right? What Paul is saying is in the final kingdom to come,
[3393.94 → 3401.50] everything that would destroy our world is destroyed in Jesus Christ. And when that happens,
[3401.66 → 3408.70] God's rule and reign will be in totality. There will be nothing that can come against his rule.
[3409.42 → 3416.70] The resurrection of Jesus guarantees for us that this new reign of God is indeed breaking into the world.
[3416.70 → 3424.52] And when we see that, and when we understand that, this kingdom that Jesus is bringing in,
[3424.92 → 3432.70] that should empower us to live differently. Because we now recognize where this world is headed.
[3433.46 → 3439.18] And so what we want to do is keep in step now with where this world is going.
[3439.18 → 3447.46] So in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is the largest atoll, I think that's how you say it,
[3447.68 → 3456.88] atoll, in the world is called Kiribati, something like that. So it's this coral reef in the middle of
[3456.88 → 3463.10] the ocean. And it's actually, there's 7,000 people who live on it. But because it is so low-lying,
[3463.10 → 3470.46] it's facing extinction because of the rising oceans and other threats. So much so that the local
[3470.46 → 3479.30] government of this island purchased 6,000 acres on Fiji, which is 2,000 kilometres away. Because
[3479.30 → 3487.30] according to their calculations, it's very possible that by the year 2050, it will be impossible to live
[3487.30 → 3494.52] on that land anymore. In light of what they see coming in the future, they're already beginning
[3494.52 → 3499.48] to make preparations. They're already looking elsewhere to see where they can buy land and live.
[3500.14 → 3509.20] Why? Because it's so obvious. This is coming to an end. And friends, Christians who believe in Christ
[3509.20 → 3516.36] and have a glorious future in God's future kingdom, we now begin to divest ourselves of everything
[3516.36 → 3522.82] that is coming to an end. And we begin to live our lives now, building our lives upon a future
[3522.82 → 3530.28] that is utterly certain, the future of God's coming kingdom. But whereas the people who live on that
[3530.28 → 3535.72] sinking island have to look elsewhere for their future life, the Bible tells us that the kingdom
[3535.72 → 3544.08] of God that is coming will be right here on earth. N.T. Wright says it beautifully. He says,
[3544.08 → 3553.52] what you do in the present by painting, preaching, singing, sewing, praying, teaching, building hospitals,
[3553.80 → 3559.62] digging wells, campaigning for justice, writing poems, caring for the needy, loving your neighbour
[3559.62 → 3566.76] as yourself, all these things will last into God's future. These activities are not simply ways of
[3566.76 → 3572.70] making the present life a little less beastly, a little more bearable. They are part of building the
[3572.70 → 3582.34] kingdom of God. And so now why would we build our lives on anything that is immoral, that is going
[3582.34 → 3588.44] to be wasting away? Why would we build relationships on anything but love? Why would we put our hope,
[3589.06 → 3596.10] our comfort in anything that is not going to last? And so what I want you to understand is that if you
[3596.10 → 3602.18] are united to the risen Christ by faith, you are sharing in the coming of God's kingdom to this
[3602.18 → 3608.92] world. That's what you are doing right now. That is the purpose of your lives. And this is why Paul
[3608.92 → 3617.70] ends this passage where he does. So look with me at verse 58. Paul says, we'll put it up here,
[3617.70 → 3624.96] therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully
[3624.96 → 3631.12] to the work of the Lord because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain. It's not meaningless.
[3631.48 → 3640.58] It's not purposeless. So when you get up tomorrow morning, and you go and do whatever it is you do,
[3640.58 → 3648.00] tomorrow's a holiday, so we're all off. But whatever it is, tomorrow or the rest of the week,
[3648.10 → 3654.36] I want you to think I'm participating in the resurrection work of Jesus Christ. Because you
[3654.36 → 3663.26] are. That's what Paul says. That is what you do. You know, these past couple weeks we've been talking
[3663.26 → 3668.38] about why Jesus died. We've been looking at all these different pictures of the atonement,
[3668.38 → 3675.88] how Jesus died to take away our sin, how he died in our place to turn away our judgment,
[3676.34 → 3683.00] to cleanse us from guilt, and all these different things. And this is the consummation of that.
[3683.68 → 3689.86] Because Christ has been raised from the dead, it confirms for us that the punishment that should
[3689.86 → 3696.42] have come upon us, the debt that we owed for our sin, has been settled and paid. Right? When Jesus
[3696.42 → 3702.52] rolled away the stone and when he walked out of the grave on Easter morning, he was confirming that
[3702.52 → 3708.24] the work was accomplished. It was finished. We are now set free because of what Jesus has done.
[3710.18 → 3720.02] Jesus died to destroy death. He destroyed the death of our own individual lives. He destroyed the
[3720.02 → 3726.00] dominion of death that affects the entire world. And what that means is that the suffering and death
[3726.00 → 3731.86] of your own bodies, the suffering and death that we experience in our relationships and our families,
[3732.44 → 3739.24] that we sometimes see in the life together that we have as a church, in our cities,
[3739.24 → 3749.46] the suffering of our children, of our Christian brothers and sisters around the world, of creation itself,
[3749.62 → 3755.48] all the death that we see and experience of the world has been defeated, and it will in time
[3755.48 → 3765.36] finally be destroyed. Why? Because Christ is risen. Hallelujah. Let's pray together.
[3765.36 → 3779.72] Lord, we thank you that on this day we can celebrate, we can raise a joyful shout because death is no more.
[3781.14 → 3790.82] And while it continues to deal defeat to us in many ways, Lord, ultimately it will not win
[3790.82 → 3798.58] because death will be destroyed because Jesus is alive. Father, we thank you for the hope,
[3799.14 → 3803.82] this glorious future that we have, and Lord, would you help us to live differently because of it.
[3804.22 → 3806.16] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3820.82 → 3822.82] Amen.
[3822.82 → 3824.82] Amen.
[3824.82 → 3825.68] Amen.
[3825.68 → 3826.54] Amen.
[3826.54 → 3828.20] Amen.
[3828.20 → 3829.38] I am sorry.
[3829.38 → 3830.38] Amen.
[3830.38 → 3831.34] Amen.
[3831.34 → 3832.86] Amen.
[3832.86 → 3834.38] Amen.
[3834.38 → 3835.44] Amen.
[3835.44 → 3839.52] Amen.
[3839.52 → 3840.38] Amen.
[3843.32 → 3844.40] Amen.
[3844.40 → 3844.86] Amen.
[3844.86 → 3845.88] Amen.
[3845.88 → 3847.28] Amen.
[3847.28 → 3850.34] Amen.
[3850.34 → 3850.76] Amen.
[3850.82 → 3866.26] Saviour, He can move the mountains.
[3866.26 → 3870.60] My God is mighty to save.
[3871.04 → 3874.26] He is mighty to save.
[3875.34 → 3880.70] Forever, author of salvation.
[3880.82 → 3885.72] He rose and conquered the name.
[3886.38 → 3890.26] Jesus conquered the name.
[3893.12 → 3896.60] So take me as you find me.
[3897.22 → 3899.70] All my fears and fears.
[3902.60 → 3906.46] Feel my life forever.
[3906.46 → 3910.86] I give my life forever.
[3910.86 → 3915.86] Everything I'm living here.
[3917.42 → 3920.86] I surrender.
[3923.18 → 3925.26] Yes, I surrender.
[3925.26 → 3934.26] Saviour, He can move the mountains.
[3935.26 → 3939.34] My God is mighty to save.
[3939.82 → 3943.26] He is mighty to save.
[3944.26 → 3949.52] Forever, author of salvation.
[3949.52 → 3951.52] He is mighty to save.
[3951.52 → 3955.52] He is mighty to save.
[3955.52 → 3959.52] Jesus, come, God, you're my name.
[3960.52 → 3961.52] Jesus, come, God, you're my name.
[3961.52 → 3963.52] Jesus, come, God, you're my name.
[3963.52 → 3965.52] I will see you.
[3965.52 → 3967.52] I will see you.
[3967.52 → 3972.52] For the glory of Jesus and King.
[3972.52 → 3980.52] Jesus, come, God, you're my name.
[3980.52 → 3982.52] He is mighty to save.
[3982.52 → 3986.52] He is mighty to save.
[3986.52 → 3988.52] Amen.
[4016.52 → 4020.52] Jesus conquered the grave.
[4021.04 → 4026.02] Forever He can move the mountains.
[4027.22 → 4031.18] My God is mighty to save.
[4031.60 → 4035.34] He is mighty to save.
[4036.18 → 4041.38] Forever on the earth's salvation.
[4041.38 → 4046.60] He rose and conquered the grave.
[4046.86 → 4050.10] Jesus conquered the grave.
[4071.38 → 4073.66] We will go to our God in the prayer.
[4074.92 → 4078.22] John Ram was admitted to the hospital yesterday with pneumonia.
[4079.38 → 4084.66] John has multiple myeloma, so his treatments for this cancer will likely be delayed.
[4085.40 → 4086.84] We will be praying for him.
[4088.78 → 4089.98] Let us pray.
[4089.98 → 4095.56] God of the bright and morning star.
[4096.02 → 4097.66] God of the rising sun.
[4098.62 → 4100.32] God of darkness banished.
[4100.68 → 4102.72] We praise and worship you.
[4103.50 → 4106.08] For empty tombs, thank you.
[4106.64 → 4110.24] For the women running with good news, thank you.
[4110.68 → 4116.26] For your presence, alive, powerful, resurrected, thank you.
[4116.26 → 4122.92] We celebrate your victory over death, over all the powers that would defeat us.
[4124.06 → 4132.12] Help us to grasp resurrection, to understand its power, to see its force at work in our world,
[4132.40 → 4137.46] overturning evil empires, changing the hatred within us,
[4138.20 → 4143.52] moving the world slowly, forcefully, bending us towards love and truth.
[4143.52 → 4151.48] Thank you that we could witness these baptisms today and hear of your work in the lives of Leo and Sienna.
[4152.26 → 4159.78] Your spirit has opened their hearts, and you have welcomed them and their sons into your family today.
[4159.78 → 4168.24] On this day of great gladness, empower us to be your ambassadors, proclaiming the good news.
[4168.78 → 4171.56] Good news in our kitchens and living rooms.
[4172.26 → 4174.48] Good news in offices and workshops.
[4175.52 → 4177.68] Good news in the fields and factories.
[4178.72 → 4183.08] Help us to be that good news, walking softly on this good earth,
[4183.90 → 4188.52] caring gently for all people, living hopefully into your kingdom.
[4188.52 → 4189.52] Good news in the fields and living rooms.
[4189.60 → 4190.26] Good news in the fields and living rooms.
[4190.26 → 4198.62] Today we pray for all who are grieving, especially George, Art and Wilma Cullen,
[4199.30 → 4206.72] Lynette and Brian, and Kim's family, the Retires, Brian, Florence, and her brothers.
[4207.82 → 4216.82] May they take comfort in knowing that Christ's victorious resurrection is also a victory for us, your children,
[4216.82 → 4221.60] and even more so, it is also a victory for Kim.
[4222.36 → 4230.48] Her long struggle is over, and she is now whole, healed, and safe in the arms of Jesus.
[4230.48 → 4245.12] And we pray for the sick, especially Joan, John, Annie, Pat, Julie, and John Ram, now hospitalized with pneumonia.
