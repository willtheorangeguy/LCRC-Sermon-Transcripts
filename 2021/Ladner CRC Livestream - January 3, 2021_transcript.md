[0.00 --> 5.00]  Ocoa
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[179.98 --> 181.60]  And you are joining us for the first time.
[182.78 --> 185.52]  So each week we have a designated offering.
[185.68 --> 191.00]  Our designated offering for this Sunday is the Deacon Help Fund, which is used to support
[191.00 --> 197.44]  the work of the deacons in caring for some of the financial needs of people in our own
[197.44 --> 197.98]  congregation.
[197.98 --> 201.32]  You can give online on our website.
[201.32 --> 204.04]  You can also mail in or drop off a check at the church.
[204.04 --> 213.42]  So we begin our worship this morning with God's call, his summoning to us to come and to know
[213.42 --> 214.48]  him and to worship him.
[214.92 --> 216.66]  And so we'll have the words on the screen.
[217.06 --> 221.00]  And where it is bold, I ask you to participate and to say it out loud.
[221.00 --> 225.34]  All who come from near and far.
[225.34 --> 228.14]  All who thirst for God.
[228.14 --> 232.50]  All whose hearts overflow with gratitude and hope.
[232.50 --> 238.04]  All whose hearts may be filled with despair or grief.
[238.04 --> 243.96]  All who come with doubts or questions about life in Jesus.
[244.52 --> 246.66]  Come and worship.
[246.66 --> 250.84]  Through the grace of God's Holy Spirit.
[251.20 --> 253.26]  Come and worship.
[253.26 --> 257.14]  Worship Christ, the newborn King.
[259.48 --> 265.06]  So God calls each and every one of us in the congregation of his people.
[265.40 --> 267.24]  And he greets us with these words.
[268.52 --> 270.12]  From Isaiah 43.
[270.90 --> 274.04]  Do not fear, for I have redeemed you.
[274.62 --> 276.60]  I have summoned you by name.
[276.70 --> 277.60]  You are mine.
[278.64 --> 281.84]  When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
[281.84 --> 286.40]  And when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[287.12 --> 289.80]  When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned.
[290.18 --> 292.36]  The flames will not set you ablaze.
[292.72 --> 294.84]  For I am the Lord your God.
[295.26 --> 296.66]  The Holy One of Israel.
[297.44 --> 298.14]  Your Savior.
[299.08 --> 303.24]  And so friends, now having received God's greeting, we greet one another.
[303.88 --> 306.32]  And so may the peace of the Lord be with you.
[307.18 --> 310.78]  And I want to encourage you today, maybe later on, to reach out to someone.
[310.78 --> 312.26]  Give them a phone call.
[313.08 --> 315.30]  Maybe send them a text or a message.
[315.68 --> 318.74]  And just pass the peace of Christ to one another today.
[320.12 --> 326.62]  And so let's begin today our time of praise with a prayer of adoration.
[326.76 --> 327.56]  Would you pray with me?
[327.56 --> 333.66]  Emmanuel, God with us, you are our heart's delight.
[334.52 --> 337.22]  Because of your amazing love, you came to earth.
[337.92 --> 339.80]  You became one of us.
[340.56 --> 343.34]  You reached out to us while we were lost.
[344.10 --> 346.18]  You rescued us from death.
[346.30 --> 347.36]  You brought us salvation.
[348.36 --> 354.68]  Your love is so high and wide and deep that only it could reach into this suffering world.
[354.68 --> 358.54]  You came to bring an end to our sadness.
[358.74 --> 360.00]  To dry our tears.
[360.52 --> 362.78]  To answer us and to give us hope.
[363.84 --> 367.04]  So Lord, in deep gratitude, we praise you.
[367.48 --> 369.80]  We worship you for dwelling among us.
[371.32 --> 374.34]  And so Father, receive our worship this morning.
[374.80 --> 376.36]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[376.36 --> 377.38]  Amen.
[377.38 --> 377.48]  Amen.
[377.48 --> 407.46]  . . .
[407.46 --> 437.44]  . . .
[437.44 --> 439.44]  . . .

[451.44 --> 453.44]  . . .
[453.44 --> 455.44]  King.
[457.06 --> 461.32]  Saints, live your contemplations,
[461.70 --> 465.28]  my delusions stream afar.
[466.22 --> 469.30]  Sing the great desire
[469.30 --> 473.10]  of nations, you have seen his
[473.10 --> 477.28]  beautiful star. Come and worship,
[477.28 --> 480.80]  come and worship, worship
[480.80 --> 484.66]  Blessed in your blood, dear
[484.66 --> 490.60]  All creation, joy and praise
[490.60 --> 495.30]  All that for the Spirit's love
[495.30 --> 499.78]  Evermore, your voice is risen
[499.78 --> 504.40]  To the day we're one, three and one
[504.40 --> 509.34]  Come and worship, come and worship
[509.34 --> 514.68]  What should rest in your blood, dear
[514.68 --> 537.66]  O hail the power of Jesus
[537.66 --> 543.00]  As they fled, angels prostrate come
[543.00 --> 554.00]  Hail Him through Savior, and crown Him above
[554.00 --> 557.34]  Bring forth the royal daughter
[557.34 --> 559.34]  And crown Him above
[559.34 --> 564.68]  The Lord and crown Him above
[564.68 --> 575.68]  The seed of Israel's chosen
[575.68 --> 579.68]  Raise the ransom from the fall
[579.68 --> 585.02]  Hail Him through Savior, and crown Him above
[585.02 --> 586.02]  Hail Him who saved you by His grace
[586.02 --> 591.02]  And crown Him above
[591.02 --> 596.02]  Hail Him who saved you by His grace
[596.02 --> 602.34]  And from him no more
[602.34 --> 614.44]  Let every tongue and every tongue
[614.44 --> 618.34]  Of his terrestrial power
[618.34 --> 623.18]  To him the majesty of the storm
[623.18 --> 629.32]  And crown him Lord of all
[629.32 --> 634.08]  To him all majesty of the storm
[634.08 --> 640.16]  And crown him Lord of all
[640.16 --> 651.72]  Go not with hand as him
[651.72 --> 657.86]  And crown him Lord of all
[657.86 --> 661.62]  Let your day ever-lasting sun
[661.62 --> 668.86]  And crown him Lord of all
[668.86 --> 673.48]  Let your day ever-lasting sun
[673.48 --> 679.62]  And crown him Lord of all
[679.62 --> 684.22]  And stand my one
[684.22 --> 687.80]  Find on me Lord of all

[699.74 --> 727.50]  We are overwhelming and you are forever
[727.50 --> 734.60]  Lord of the angels, go before time
[734.60 --> 740.94]  We are the keeper, you are eternal
[740.94 --> 749.48]  No everlasting reignings on high
[749.48 --> 755.66]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty
[755.66 --> 762.70]  Holy is the Lamb who was slain
[762.70 --> 768.66]  Highest praises, full of glory
[768.66 --> 773.70]  Be unto your name
[773.70 --> 780.66]  Be unto your name
[780.66 --> 788.70]  We are broken, you are the young
[788.70 --> 795.84]  Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save
[795.84 --> 801.70]  You are the Lord, we will sing forever
[801.70 --> 805.58]  I'll wake before you
[805.58 --> 808.74]  Bless in your name
[808.74 --> 815.70]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty
[815.70 --> 822.74]  Holy, holy Lord God Almighty
[822.74 --> 829.78]  Highest praises, honor and glory
[829.78 --> 833.78]  Be unto your name
[833.78 --> 840.78]  Be unto your name
[840.78 --> 855.82]  Be unto your name
[855.82 --> 870.86]  Be unto your name
[870.86 --> 874.86]  Be unto your name
[874.86 --> 878.86]  Be unto your name
[878.86 --> 892.20]  We continue to worship the Lord together this morning by being renewed in God's grace
[892.20 --> 896.92]  We celebrate that Jesus our Lord came to earth as a human
[896.92 --> 898.24]  Just like us
[898.24 --> 899.78]  But without sin
[899.78 --> 902.60]  And he came so that we who sin
[902.60 --> 905.26]  Might be freed from our sin
[905.26 --> 910.96]  And so with the peace that comes from knowing that Jesus came to save us
[910.96 --> 912.96]  Let us confess our sins
[912.96 --> 913.48]  Let us confess our sins
[913.48 --> 914.70]  And be forgiven
[914.70 --> 918.94]  So we'll also have these words of confession on our screen
[918.94 --> 920.36]  And again, where it is bold
[920.36 --> 921.48]  I'll ask you to participate
[921.48 --> 922.88]  And read out loud
[922.88 --> 925.48]  Holy God
[925.48 --> 927.68]  In this season of Christ
[927.68 --> 930.86]  We need Christ to renew us
[930.86 --> 934.14]  Our lack of faith has made us fearful
[934.14 --> 937.46]  May your angels sing again
[937.46 --> 938.98]  To us of peace
[938.98 --> 944.14]  We have foolishly let our desires lead us astray
[944.14 --> 948.46]  May your star once more guide us toward you
[948.46 --> 952.98]  We have grown complacent in following you
[952.98 --> 957.82]  May your shepherds call us again to the joy of salvation
[957.82 --> 962.18]  We have not given our hearts to you
[962.18 --> 966.36]  And so may the magi show us the way of generosity
[966.36 --> 971.08]  Lord, may your spirit dwell in our hearts
[971.08 --> 973.68]  And bring renewal to our lives
[973.68 --> 974.82]  Amen
[974.82 --> 980.02]  So now, friends, receive these words of grace
[980.02 --> 981.98]  From Titus chapter 3
[981.98 --> 986.38]  When the goodness and loving kindness of God, our Savior, appeared
[986.38 --> 988.10]  He saved us
[988.10 --> 991.64]  Not because of any works of righteousness that we had done
[991.64 --> 994.16]  But according to his mercy
[994.16 --> 998.68]  Through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit
[998.68 --> 1003.34]  This spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, our Savior
[1003.34 --> 1006.80]  So that having been justified by his grace
[1006.80 --> 1008.88]  We might become heirs
[1008.88 --> 1011.98]  According to the hope of eternal life
[1011.98 --> 1016.26]  And so let us sing a song of renewal together
[1016.26 --> 1017.64]  Jesus, Messiah
[1017.64 --> 1026.96]  Jesus, Messiah
[1026.96 --> 1040.96]  Jesus, Messiah
[1040.96 --> 1045.20]  And so let us sing this song of chapter 4
[1045.20 --> 1045.92]  May our Lord
[1045.92 --> 1049.50]  God, Our Lord
[1049.50 --> 1067.76]  May our Lord
[1067.76 --> 1079.52]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[1083.26 --> 1094.60]  He became sin, known all sin, that we might become his righteousness.
[1094.60 --> 1103.38]  He humbled himself and carried the cross.
[1103.76 --> 1112.42]  Love so amazing, love so amazing.
[1114.56 --> 1119.42]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[1119.42 --> 1129.20]  Name of all names, this will redeem us.
[1129.30 --> 1144.92]  No worry or there is just one sin, no sense from heaven.
[1144.92 --> 1150.06]  Jesus my Son
[1150.06 --> 1155.82]  Lord of all
[1155.82 --> 1162.74]  His body the bread
[1162.74 --> 1166.00]  His blood the wine
[1166.00 --> 1169.00]  Broken but out
[1169.00 --> 1171.96]  All for love
[1171.96 --> 1174.88]  The heart trembled
[1174.88 --> 1179.50]  And the bell was torn
[1179.50 --> 1182.80]  Love so amazing
[1182.80 --> 1188.22]  Love so amazing
[1188.22 --> 1193.38]  Jesus my Son
[1193.38 --> 1199.88]  May God all peace
[1199.88 --> 1203.88]  Blessed Redeemer
[1203.88 --> 1207.50]  Emmanuel
[1207.50 --> 1207.64]  Emmanuel
[1207.64 --> 1213.80]  The rescue for sinners
[1213.80 --> 1217.84]  We're all self-aware
[1217.84 --> 1223.80]  Jesus my Son
[1223.80 --> 1227.56]  Lord of all
[1227.56 --> 1229.72]  Lord of all
[1229.72 --> 1231.72]  Lord of all
[1231.72 --> 1233.72]  Lord of all
[1233.72 --> 1237.26]  My hope is in you
[1237.26 --> 1239.50]  Lord of all
[1239.50 --> 1241.50]  Hope is in you
[1241.50 --> 1242.12]  Hope is in you
[1242.12 --> 1247.42]  All the glory to you
[1247.42 --> 1249.42]  Lord of all
[1249.42 --> 1251.42]  Lord of all
[1251.42 --> 1261.34]  Jesus my Son
[1261.34 --> 1263.34]  Jesus my Son
[1263.34 --> 1265.34]  Jesus my Son
[1265.34 --> 1267.26]  Lord of all
[1267.26 --> 1269.10]  Lord of all
[1269.10 --> 1270.96]  Jesus my Son
[1270.96 --> 1271.26]  Lord of all
[1271.26 --> 1273.26]  Jesus my Son
[1273.26 --> 1275.26]  Lord of all
[1275.26 --> 1277.26]  Jesus my Son
[1277.26 --> 1283.18]  Lord of all
[1283.18 --> 1287.18]  Lord of all
[1287.18 --> 1291.18]  Jesus my Son
[1291.18 --> 1295.10]  Lord of all
[1295.10 --> 1298.22]  Lord of all
[1298.22 --> 1309.34]  Passover Muh Jeez my Son
[1309.34 --> 1310.78]  Father of all
[1310.78 --> 1310.92]  Father of all
[1310.92 --> 1312.80]  So today is the first Sunday
[1312.80 --> 1320.10]  in the church season of Epiphany. So having come through the season of Advent where we longed
[1320.10 --> 1326.52]  for Jesus to come, and then having spent Christmas celebrating, perhaps with the eating of many
[1326.52 --> 1334.12]  cookies, that Jesus has come, right, not only to us but to this whole world, we now turn in this
[1334.12 --> 1341.80]  wonderful season of Epiphany to seek to understand who Jesus is. The word Epiphany means manifestation,
[1341.80 --> 1349.40]  and Jesus is the very revelation of God. And so in the season of Epiphany, the church often dwells on
[1349.40 --> 1355.90]  the person and the life of Jesus. And the way that we are going to do this as a church, and I'm really
[1355.90 --> 1362.52]  excited about this, is that we are going to begin a new seven-week series through the I Am statements
[1362.52 --> 1369.98]  found in the Gospel of John. And here's the reason why we're doing this. One of the things that I
[1369.98 --> 1377.58]  think is really important for us as a church community, a community that exists for Jesus,
[1378.08 --> 1385.18]  a community that exists because of the grace of Jesus, is that we anchor ourselves continually
[1385.18 --> 1390.80]  in this incredible question that Jesus himself posed to his disciples, which is,
[1390.80 --> 1399.14]  who do you say that I am? And I think that this is the most important question. This is the most
[1399.14 --> 1405.30]  central question that we can ask. You know, and we're going to have lots of questions about our faith,
[1406.30 --> 1412.32]  different aspects of our faith, and questions around Scripture. But the thing that brings us
[1412.32 --> 1419.66]  to saving faith, the thing that transforms our lives, is not being able to answer every puzzling question
[1419.66 --> 1428.44]  we might have, but it's encountering Jesus, and it's knowing him. Because once we accept the reality
[1428.44 --> 1436.00]  of who Christ is and who he claimed to be, that he is God in the flesh, the God who is willing to enter
[1436.00 --> 1441.40]  into the brokenness of the human experience, and then to take that brokenness upon himself on the cross,
[1441.74 --> 1447.36]  the God who said that we, as men and women, can't do anything to reach God in our own effort,
[1447.36 --> 1455.46]  but it requires God to intervene and to come to us and draw himself to us. Friends, that is the
[1455.46 --> 1465.08]  foundation that we can build our lives upon, and it begins with Christ. So I found this quote by John
[1465.08 --> 1469.14]  Calvin, which I think is really helpful. This is what John Calvin said,
[1469.14 --> 1480.00]  whoever aspires to know God without beginning at Christ must wander in a labyrinth, and whoever directs
[1480.00 --> 1488.38]  his mind and all of his senses to Christ will be led straight to the Father. And so friends, we must
[1488.38 --> 1496.06]  begin at Christ, because in knowing Christ we will also know God, because Jesus is the light of the
[1496.06 --> 1501.92]  knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. So that's what we're going to be exploring
[1501.92 --> 1510.04]  over these next seven weeks, looking at what Jesus tells us about who he is. And so today, what I want
[1510.04 --> 1521.50]  to begin with is Jesus's most direct declaration, his most direct I am statement, and it's found in the
[1521.50 --> 1528.46]  Gospel of John in chapter 8. And so today we're going to just look at a smaller section. It's chapter 8,
[1528.72 --> 1536.24]  verses 51 to 58. So we'll have the scripture here on the screen for us, and please give your attention to
[1536.24 --> 1545.88]  God's word. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death. At this they exclaimed,
[1545.88 --> 1552.50]  now we know that you are demon-possessed. Abraham died, and so did the prophets. Yet you say that
[1552.50 --> 1559.76]  whoever obeys your word will never taste death? Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died,
[1559.90 --> 1567.20]  and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are? Jesus replied, if I glorify myself, my glory means
[1567.20 --> 1576.20]  nothing. My father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. Though you do not know him,
[1576.54 --> 1584.56]  I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and obey his word.
[1585.60 --> 1594.14]  Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day. He saw it and was glad. You were not
[1594.14 --> 1602.50]  yet fifty years old, they said to him. And you have seen Abraham? Very truly I tell you, Jesus answered,
[1603.20 --> 1610.52]  before Abraham was born, I am. This is the word of the Lord.
[1613.72 --> 1621.70]  Let's pray together as we begin. Heavenly Father, we come before you, Lord, seeking to know who you are,
[1621.70 --> 1631.46]  seeking to know through Jesus our Savior, the one whom we follow, the one whom we worship and look to.
[1632.50 --> 1638.62]  Lord, to know him, to follow him more closely, to make him more the center of our life,
[1639.14 --> 1645.62]  and the Lord of all things. And so we come to your word. And as we come, Lord, would you
[1645.62 --> 1651.66]  reveal yourself to us in the season of epiphany, the season of revelation? Would you show us more of
[1651.66 --> 1656.92]  who you are? The beauty of God in the face of Jesus. We pray in his holy name. Amen.
[1658.02 --> 1665.80]  So one of the presents I got my daughter Ellie for Christmas was a book. It's called A Wizard of Earthsea
[1665.80 --> 1671.56]  by Ursula Le Guin. As soon as she opened on Christmas, I said, Ellie, can I borrow that?
[1671.56 --> 1676.48]  And so I was the first one to read it. I was actually really excited to get it.
[1677.38 --> 1678.92]  This is how you get yourself presents.
[1680.10 --> 1683.48]  So in the land of Earthsea, it's a fantasy,
[1684.44 --> 1686.02]  where the story takes place,
[1686.88 --> 1690.58]  when you turn 13 years old, there is a naming ritual.
[1690.76 --> 1693.74]  It's kind of a rite of passage where you are given
[1693.74 --> 1695.82]  your true name.
[1695.82 --> 1706.04]  Everything has a true name. Rocks, trees, fish, people all have a true name, but people usually call
[1706.04 --> 1713.12]  things by their common name. And the true name of a thing is powerful because it's bound up with its
[1713.12 --> 1720.28]  very identity in nature. And so in the story, the main character is a boy named Jed. And at one point
[1720.28 --> 1730.72]  in the story, he makes a friend. And this friend tells him his true name. This is a big deal. And so this is what it says.
[1731.28 --> 1740.22]  Jed stood for a while like one who has received great news and must enlarge his spirit to receive it.
[1741.22 --> 1745.80]  It was a great gift that his friend had given him, the knowledge of his true name.
[1745.80 --> 1750.46]  No one knows a man's true name by himself in his namer.
[1751.20 --> 1755.36]  He may choose at length to tell it to his brother or wife or a friend.
[1756.04 --> 1759.72]  Yet even those few will never use it where any third person may hear it.
[1760.36 --> 1763.48]  In front of other people, they will call him by his common name.
[1764.30 --> 1769.50]  Thus to Jed had been given that gift only a friend can give.
[1770.18 --> 1774.32]  The proof of unshakable, unshaken trust.
[1774.32 --> 1783.08]  Friends, the reason I'm talking about this is that in the same way, Jesus has a true name.
[1784.40 --> 1788.82]  And in the same way, Jesus has given us this name.
[1788.92 --> 1793.88]  He has told us his name because he calls us to be his friend.
[1794.40 --> 1796.72]  And he calls us to trust in him.
[1797.56 --> 1802.30]  And we also must enlarge our spirit to receive it.
[1802.30 --> 1805.54]  You know, Jesus has several names in the Bible.
[1806.30 --> 1810.84]  For one, he is called Jesus, which means Savior.
[1811.80 --> 1815.36]  That's the name the angel Gabriel told Mary to call him.
[1816.12 --> 1819.00]  You know, he's also called in the Gospels the Son of God.
[1819.40 --> 1822.46]  He is called Emmanuel, the Christ, the Messiah.
[1822.46 --> 1829.06]  But in this passage, in John chapter 8, Jesus tells us, in a sense, his true name.
[1829.56 --> 1835.34]  The name that most powerfully reveals his nature, his identity, who he really is.
[1836.82 --> 1838.54]  And so the question is, who is Jesus?
[1839.68 --> 1843.64]  That's the question the people gathered around him in this dialogue ask him.
[1843.64 --> 1848.68]  In verse 53, they say to him, who do you think you are?
[1849.64 --> 1851.78]  Kind of a snarky way of saying, who are you?
[1851.90 --> 1853.14]  What is your name?
[1853.88 --> 1855.78]  So today, let's ask that same question.
[1856.56 --> 1858.48]  And we're going to ask it in three different ways.
[1858.84 --> 1862.80]  So we're going to consider together, who does Jesus say he is?
[1863.98 --> 1866.30]  Who do they say he is?
[1866.32 --> 1867.18]  That is the crowds.
[1867.76 --> 1869.70]  And who do you say he is?
[1869.70 --> 1873.82]  Okay, so the first one here, who does Jesus say he is?
[1874.70 --> 1878.36]  And we see the answer in verse 58, where Jesus says,
[1878.76 --> 1884.18]  Very truly I tell you, before Abraham was born, I am.
[1884.86 --> 1888.78]  Okay, Jesus is the great I am.
[1889.34 --> 1891.20]  This is his true name.
[1891.68 --> 1896.54]  And to understand what that means, we have to have the context in the background
[1896.54 --> 1901.36]  because Jesus is actually referring way back to Exodus chapter 3,
[1901.70 --> 1904.96]  where we find the story of Moses and the burning bush.
[1905.96 --> 1910.84]  So let's scroll back and take a look at what happens in Exodus 3.
[1912.34 --> 1915.22]  So in Exodus 3, we have Moses.
[1915.82 --> 1919.40]  Moses is wandering around in the wilderness.
[1919.76 --> 1922.68]  And the literal term is the backside of the wilderness.
[1922.68 --> 1925.66]  No one knows where the backside of the wilderness is.
[1926.28 --> 1928.82]  And he's up on this mountain, Mount Horeb,
[1929.52 --> 1932.94]  which is out there in a land, the land of Midian.
[1933.88 --> 1936.40]  And so he's out there tending sheep.
[1936.62 --> 1940.72]  And he has been doing this for 40 years.
[1941.20 --> 1941.74]  Can you imagine?
[1941.96 --> 1943.44]  Tending sheep for 40 years.
[1944.06 --> 1945.46]  Not very exciting.
[1946.40 --> 1950.42]  But one day, something exciting happens.
[1950.42 --> 1953.72]  Probably the most exciting thing that happened in this period of time.
[1954.44 --> 1955.84]  There is a bush on fire.
[1956.66 --> 1959.30]  And the bush is not burning.
[1959.94 --> 1961.08]  Okay, very weird.
[1961.88 --> 1963.24]  And so Moses says to himself,
[1963.66 --> 1966.90]  I'm going to go over here and check out this burning bush.
[1967.56 --> 1969.28]  Okay, this is, if we think this is strange,
[1969.36 --> 1970.70]  it was just as strange to Moses.
[1971.38 --> 1973.68]  So he goes to just see what is happening.
[1974.24 --> 1976.32]  Moses is thinking, this is really strange.
[1976.48 --> 1978.60]  Bushes do not burn and do not burn up.
[1979.08 --> 1980.04]  This never happens.
[1980.04 --> 1983.10]  This must be, right now, it's happening a miracle.
[1984.04 --> 1987.14]  So he gets nearer to the burning bush to check it out.
[1987.74 --> 1989.86]  And God says, stop.
[1991.00 --> 1992.16]  Do not come any closer.
[1993.06 --> 1996.82]  Take off your sandals, for you are standing on holy ground.
[1998.10 --> 2002.58]  So Moses is arrested by God in his approach to him.
[2003.08 --> 2004.76]  And God speaks to him.
[2005.06 --> 2007.92]  And it's the very voice of God.
[2007.92 --> 2018.56]  And so everything going on so far in this story is reinforcing the complete holiness and separation of God from his creation.
[2019.30 --> 2019.40]  Right?
[2019.46 --> 2021.26]  None of these things should be happening.
[2021.94 --> 2024.92]  This is just an ordinary little bush in a little bit of desert.
[2024.92 --> 2030.62]  And God is now declaring his presence here in this spot.
[2031.26 --> 2034.98]  Speaking out of it and stopping Moses because this is holy ground.
[2035.98 --> 2036.14]  Right?
[2036.14 --> 2041.62]  The glory and majesty of God in the midst of this fire is telling Moses who he is.
[2042.10 --> 2043.24]  That God is holy.
[2043.80 --> 2045.76]  That he is separate and different.
[2046.48 --> 2048.88]  And you don't just casually walk up to him.
[2050.48 --> 2055.08]  Well, the next thing that happens is there's a conversation between Moses and God.
[2055.08 --> 2065.72]  God had told Moses that Moses is going to be the one to go back to Egypt and to free God's people from slavery from under the hand of Pharaoh.
[2066.84 --> 2069.16]  Moses has a lot of questions about this.
[2069.84 --> 2071.62]  But one of his questions is this.
[2072.40 --> 2077.74]  Moses says, God, just in case they ask, what's your name?
[2077.74 --> 2086.42]  And God answers and says this very famous phrase, I am who I am.
[2086.48 --> 2088.24]  Or I will be who I will be.
[2088.34 --> 2089.72]  The grammar is a little bit unclear.
[2090.64 --> 2097.74]  But God is declaring in this kind of long description name the fact that he is absolutely uncreated.
[2098.52 --> 2100.10]  He is existence himself.
[2100.48 --> 2103.40]  He's absolutely independent of all of his creation.
[2104.02 --> 2105.92]  He has no beginning or end.
[2105.92 --> 2112.58]  If you want to know who God is, it's simply, I am who I am.
[2113.54 --> 2117.60]  God is unlike any of the surrounding polytheistic gods.
[2117.74 --> 2122.30]  You know, the God of thunder, the God of horses, the God of, you know, fertility.
[2123.32 --> 2124.18]  Who is God?
[2125.12 --> 2126.50]  I am who I am.
[2127.22 --> 2127.36]  Right?
[2127.50 --> 2128.82]  God is God.
[2129.54 --> 2131.76]  God alone is God.
[2131.76 --> 2131.80]  God.
[2132.86 --> 2136.10]  And in some ways, it's kind of the most difficult to comprehend.
[2137.10 --> 2141.28]  But it's actually the clearest description of who God is.
[2142.94 --> 2146.42]  But before we leave the story of Moses, there's something really important here.
[2147.14 --> 2154.12]  This powerful, infinite, eternal God says, I've been listening to my people's cry.
[2154.12 --> 2158.38]  For 400 years, God's people were slaves in Egypt.
[2159.28 --> 2159.40]  Right?
[2159.62 --> 2167.62]  Mothers wept as children were raised up to be nothing but slaves in mud pits, who then would
[2167.62 --> 2172.36]  have children who would be raised up to be nothing but slaves in mud pits.
[2172.88 --> 2176.88]  And they cried out to God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2176.88 --> 2179.32]  And they said, God, get us out of here.
[2180.06 --> 2181.34]  God, deliver us.
[2182.18 --> 2186.28]  And for 400 years, it seemed that no one was listening.
[2187.38 --> 2195.88]  But here, this God of eternity, who has the whole earth and time and everything in his hands,
[2196.78 --> 2200.82]  the God that you do not casually approach, says, I have heard my people's cry.
[2201.42 --> 2204.40]  And I am now coming to save them.
[2204.40 --> 2206.62]  God listens.
[2207.62 --> 2211.24]  He's the God who will bring freedom to his people.
[2211.36 --> 2213.58]  He is the God who will bring salvation.
[2214.90 --> 2220.44]  And that's why God says to Moses, this is what you are to say to the Israelites.
[2221.30 --> 2225.16]  I am has sent me to you.
[2225.86 --> 2226.18]  Right?
[2226.24 --> 2229.62]  It's the same name for God that we often hear, Yahweh.
[2229.62 --> 2236.08]  Up until this moment in Exodus 3, the name for God that was often used is Elohim.
[2236.84 --> 2236.94]  Right?
[2237.04 --> 2240.02]  So in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[2240.14 --> 2240.66]  Elohim.
[2240.82 --> 2242.14]  He's the God of creation.
[2243.06 --> 2247.08]  But when God spoke his name the first time in Scripture, out of the burning bush,
[2247.84 --> 2249.46]  it was not Elohim.
[2249.68 --> 2251.28]  It was the personal name of God.
[2251.52 --> 2252.68]  God's true name.
[2252.98 --> 2254.16]  His covenant name.
[2254.16 --> 2259.36]  The name by which he was entering into a deep relationship with his people.
[2260.42 --> 2265.68]  It's the name by which God wished to be known and worshipped by his people, Yahweh.
[2266.50 --> 2275.12]  It's the name that expresses his character as the faithful God who desires the full trust of his people.
[2275.12 --> 2287.76]  So now when we scroll forward to the New Testament, we see that this great I Am, this powerful and mighty God,
[2288.54 --> 2294.54]  who has many other names throughout the Old Testament, has another name.
[2295.28 --> 2296.70]  And it's called Jesus Christ.
[2297.48 --> 2301.76]  The very I Am is Jesus.
[2301.76 --> 2306.62]  And Jesus, in this incredible dialogue in John A., is speaking in the temple.
[2307.16 --> 2309.38]  And at the end of the conversation, he declares,
[2309.90 --> 2312.94]  Before Abraham was, I am.
[2313.92 --> 2316.40]  Jesus says, I am God.
[2316.90 --> 2320.18]  I am the same God who spoke to Moses out of the burning bush.
[2321.24 --> 2323.66]  He says, Before Abraham was, I am.
[2323.74 --> 2328.04]  I am the God who has come into my creation.
[2328.72 --> 2330.26]  I have taken on human form.
[2330.26 --> 2332.08]  I have come to deliver my people.
[2332.42 --> 2336.86]  This time not sending Moses, but I have come myself.
[2337.28 --> 2339.04]  I have answered my people's cry.
[2340.54 --> 2341.88]  And notice what he says.
[2342.78 --> 2347.52]  When he says, I am, what are we being told here?
[2348.64 --> 2354.38]  We're told that God essentially has given his own name to Jesus.
[2354.38 --> 2360.18]  And this is exactly what Jesus himself declares in John 17, verse 11.
[2360.78 --> 2361.48]  Jesus says,
[2362.20 --> 2370.58]  Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me,
[2371.30 --> 2373.82]  so that they may be one as we are one.
[2373.82 --> 2381.10]  And hearing this, the Jews knew exactly what he was saying,
[2381.30 --> 2384.44]  that he was declaring himself to be one with God,
[2384.72 --> 2391.24]  and they picked up stones because stoning was the penalty of blasphemy,
[2391.70 --> 2395.70]  because he claimed to be God, and they sought to stone him.
[2395.70 --> 2400.22]  So who does Jesus say he is?
[2401.00 --> 2402.32]  He's the great I am.
[2403.64 --> 2406.72]  Now second, who do they say he was?
[2408.80 --> 2411.76]  In verse 51, Jesus says this.
[2411.84 --> 2412.02]  He says,
[2412.08 --> 2415.58]  I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death, right?
[2415.62 --> 2417.96]  Because he is eternal.
[2418.48 --> 2419.62]  He is life himself.
[2419.62 --> 2422.60]  And here he is telling us,
[2422.88 --> 2425.48]  if you keep yourself rooted in me,
[2426.20 --> 2428.42]  though your body will die physically,
[2428.60 --> 2430.26]  ultimately you will never die.
[2430.64 --> 2430.94]  Why?
[2431.42 --> 2434.86]  Because he is the one who will taste death for everyone.
[2436.04 --> 2438.88]  And at that, the people respond in verse 52,
[2439.56 --> 2441.48]  now we know you are demon-possessed.
[2442.42 --> 2444.52]  So that's the answer to the second question.
[2445.24 --> 2446.28]  Who do the crowds,
[2446.98 --> 2449.58]  who moments ago were actually following him,
[2449.62 --> 2450.68]  kind of believing in him,
[2451.10 --> 2452.30]  who do they say he is?
[2452.62 --> 2453.68]  He is demon-possessed.
[2454.92 --> 2457.46]  You know, and there's a couple ways of reading this
[2457.46 --> 2458.50]  and understanding it.
[2459.38 --> 2464.66]  You can be demonic in the sense that you are deluding, right?
[2464.72 --> 2466.76]  You are a liar and a fraud,
[2466.86 --> 2468.98]  and you are trying to get power over someone else.
[2470.10 --> 2474.26]  Or you can be demonic in the sense that you are deluded, right?
[2474.28 --> 2475.08]  You're just crazy.
[2475.08 --> 2477.26]  And the point is,
[2477.34 --> 2478.42]  he's either demonic,
[2479.24 --> 2481.18]  as a liar or a lunatic,
[2482.04 --> 2483.28]  or he's divine.
[2483.82 --> 2484.66]  He is the Lord.
[2485.34 --> 2485.54]  Right?
[2485.60 --> 2486.76]  And there's nothing in the middle.
[2487.50 --> 2488.98]  So notice they never say,
[2489.90 --> 2493.34]  after hearing Jesus say he is the life,
[2494.02 --> 2494.94]  that you will not die,
[2495.06 --> 2495.76]  they never say,
[2496.14 --> 2497.36]  what a great moral teacher.
[2498.28 --> 2498.50]  Right?
[2498.54 --> 2499.26]  They never say,
[2499.78 --> 2502.06]  well, these are amazing insights for life.
[2502.40 --> 2504.42]  I need to go home and kind of chew on this
[2504.42 --> 2505.54]  and think it through.
[2505.94 --> 2506.12]  Right?
[2506.14 --> 2506.96]  They never say that.
[2507.66 --> 2508.30]  They say,
[2508.46 --> 2509.60]  you have a demon.
[2511.20 --> 2511.34]  You know,
[2511.38 --> 2512.98]  probably the most famous passage
[2512.98 --> 2514.84]  in all of C.S. Lewis' writings
[2514.84 --> 2517.10]  is where he talks about this,
[2517.92 --> 2521.06]  about who we believe Jesus to be.
[2522.20 --> 2522.60]  So what,
[2522.70 --> 2523.96]  here's what C.S. Lewis says
[2523.96 --> 2525.00]  in his book,
[2525.08 --> 2525.76]  Mere Christianity.
[2526.58 --> 2528.24]  It's probably kind of familiar to us.
[2528.28 --> 2528.94]  He says this,
[2530.64 --> 2532.88]  I am trying here to prevent anyone
[2532.88 --> 2535.02]  saying the really foolish thing
[2535.02 --> 2536.86]  that people often say about him.
[2537.32 --> 2537.60]  Quote,
[2538.10 --> 2539.42]  I'm ready to accept Jesus
[2539.42 --> 2540.82]  as a great moral teacher,
[2541.44 --> 2543.32]  but I don't accept his claim to be God.
[2544.12 --> 2544.54]  End quote.
[2545.40 --> 2546.86]  This is the one thing
[2546.86 --> 2548.12]  we must not say.
[2548.88 --> 2550.74]  A man who is merely a man
[2550.74 --> 2553.12]  and said the sort of things Jesus said
[2553.12 --> 2554.94]  would not be a great moral teacher.
[2555.82 --> 2557.30]  He would either be a lunatic
[2557.30 --> 2558.96]  on the level with a man
[2558.96 --> 2560.50]  who says he is a poached egg
[2560.50 --> 2563.82]  or else he would be the devil of hell.
[2564.64 --> 2566.14]  You must make your choice.
[2566.62 --> 2568.94]  Either this man was and is the son of God
[2568.94 --> 2571.12]  or else a madman
[2571.12 --> 2572.40]  or something worse.
[2573.44 --> 2575.54]  I have to accept the view,
[2575.74 --> 2576.32]  says C.S. Lewis,
[2576.82 --> 2579.34]  that he was and is God.
[2579.34 --> 2581.62]  You know,
[2581.70 --> 2583.48]  and Jesus is basically saying
[2583.48 --> 2585.10]  either crown me
[2585.10 --> 2586.64]  or kill me.
[2587.30 --> 2588.50]  I'm either Lord
[2588.50 --> 2590.44]  or I'm demonic.
[2591.42 --> 2592.72]  You can either make me
[2592.72 --> 2594.12]  the center of your life
[2594.12 --> 2595.62]  or you must do everything you can
[2595.62 --> 2596.46]  to stay away from me
[2596.46 --> 2597.80]  and maybe even get rid of me.
[2599.50 --> 2600.22]  But you know,
[2600.32 --> 2601.58]  I think for us,
[2602.14 --> 2603.62]  we don't like that choice.
[2603.62 --> 2605.32]  You know,
[2605.70 --> 2607.92]  nobody really wants
[2607.92 --> 2609.78]  to call Jesus demonic,
[2610.42 --> 2612.26]  but many people also
[2612.26 --> 2613.58]  don't want to call him
[2613.58 --> 2614.52]  the Lord
[2614.52 --> 2616.18]  in the center of their lives either.
[2617.36 --> 2617.94]  But friends,
[2618.10 --> 2619.10]  Jesus doesn't want us
[2619.10 --> 2619.90]  to stay there
[2619.90 --> 2620.80]  on the fence
[2620.80 --> 2621.80]  about who he is.
[2622.12 --> 2623.86]  He tells us who he is
[2623.86 --> 2625.10]  and he does so
[2625.10 --> 2626.62]  because he wants us
[2626.62 --> 2627.50]  to know him,
[2627.96 --> 2629.06]  who he truly is,
[2629.10 --> 2629.72]  his character,
[2630.10 --> 2631.28]  and he wants us
[2631.28 --> 2631.98]  to trust him.
[2632.68 --> 2633.62]  And that's what we see
[2633.62 --> 2634.46]  Jesus doing
[2634.46 --> 2635.74]  constantly in the Gospels.
[2636.12 --> 2637.96]  He's always kind of saying
[2637.96 --> 2639.96]  these outrageous things
[2639.96 --> 2641.66]  but are true.
[2642.00 --> 2642.92]  And he's saying them
[2642.92 --> 2644.04]  in the most winsome
[2644.04 --> 2644.84]  and humble
[2644.84 --> 2646.50]  and yet confident way
[2646.50 --> 2647.44]  imaginable.
[2648.18 --> 2649.10]  Not sounding like
[2649.10 --> 2649.90]  a crazy person
[2649.90 --> 2651.30]  but someone who is
[2651.30 --> 2652.24]  telling the truth
[2652.24 --> 2654.00]  and is showing
[2654.00 --> 2655.10]  what he's saying
[2655.10 --> 2656.42]  by all of the amazing
[2656.42 --> 2657.30]  things he does.
[2658.40 --> 2659.58]  He's pushing people
[2659.58 --> 2661.56]  to either bow down
[2661.56 --> 2662.84]  to him as Lord
[2662.84 --> 2664.42]  or to kill him
[2664.42 --> 2665.12]  as a blasphemer.
[2666.20 --> 2667.20]  And that's
[2667.20 --> 2668.04]  what they did.
[2668.94 --> 2669.14]  Right?
[2669.22 --> 2670.00]  So you have two groups
[2670.00 --> 2670.42]  of people.
[2670.56 --> 2671.16]  One group
[2671.16 --> 2671.96]  of people
[2671.96 --> 2672.76]  brought him
[2672.76 --> 2673.94]  before the Roman rulers
[2673.94 --> 2674.90]  and they sought to
[2674.90 --> 2676.02]  have him crucified.
[2677.20 --> 2678.22]  But there's a whole
[2678.22 --> 2679.54]  other group of people
[2679.54 --> 2680.92]  whose lives
[2680.92 --> 2682.24]  were so transformed
[2682.24 --> 2682.90]  by him
[2682.90 --> 2684.54]  that they transformed
[2684.54 --> 2685.46]  the entire world.
[2685.46 --> 2687.54]  And those are
[2687.54 --> 2688.74]  the only two choices
[2688.74 --> 2690.90]  if you understand
[2690.90 --> 2691.84]  what he is
[2691.84 --> 2693.14]  really saying.
[2695.96 --> 2696.74]  And so
[2696.74 --> 2697.74]  that brings us
[2697.74 --> 2699.08]  to the last question.
[2700.20 --> 2701.10]  Who do you say
[2701.10 --> 2701.78]  that he is?
[2701.96 --> 2702.52]  This is kind of
[2702.52 --> 2703.74]  the application
[2703.74 --> 2704.72]  and implications
[2704.72 --> 2705.32]  for us.
[2705.64 --> 2706.52]  Who do you say
[2706.52 --> 2707.04]  he is?
[2707.68 --> 2708.70]  It's a simple question
[2708.70 --> 2710.42]  but it has
[2710.42 --> 2711.14]  enormous
[2711.14 --> 2712.42]  implications
[2712.42 --> 2713.28]  if we take it
[2713.28 --> 2713.74]  seriously.
[2715.02 --> 2715.56]  Right?
[2715.60 --> 2716.34]  If you're a Christian
[2716.34 --> 2717.78]  that means you believe
[2717.78 --> 2718.24]  that Jesus
[2718.24 --> 2719.60]  is the great I am.
[2720.24 --> 2721.10]  He is God.
[2721.32 --> 2721.86]  The one
[2721.86 --> 2722.80]  and true
[2722.80 --> 2723.52]  God.
[2724.14 --> 2724.66]  The one
[2724.66 --> 2725.52]  who is before
[2725.52 --> 2726.16]  all things
[2726.16 --> 2726.92]  and in whom
[2726.92 --> 2727.90]  all things exist.
[2728.56 --> 2729.78]  So I want to
[2729.78 --> 2730.58]  conclude
[2730.58 --> 2731.80]  and close
[2731.80 --> 2732.28]  with
[2732.28 --> 2733.28]  this passage
[2733.28 --> 2734.12]  from Colossians
[2734.12 --> 2734.82]  chapter 1
[2734.82 --> 2736.28]  that tells us
[2736.28 --> 2737.00]  about Jesus.
[2737.72 --> 2738.74]  This is what it says.
[2738.74 --> 2767.92]  Jesus says
[2767.92 --> 2769.34]  before Abraham
[2769.34 --> 2770.12]  was
[2770.12 --> 2771.48]  I am.
[2772.30 --> 2772.64]  Right?
[2772.74 --> 2774.18]  He is the eternal
[2774.18 --> 2776.08]  the mighty God
[2776.08 --> 2777.26]  who has heard
[2777.26 --> 2778.60]  the cry of his people
[2778.60 --> 2780.22]  and who has come
[2780.22 --> 2781.24]  to save us.
[2781.90 --> 2782.82]  And he wants
[2782.82 --> 2783.56]  a relationship
[2783.56 --> 2784.14]  with you.
[2784.82 --> 2785.84]  He has given you
[2785.84 --> 2786.52]  his name.
[2787.42 --> 2788.24]  He has told you
[2788.24 --> 2789.18]  his true name.
[2789.92 --> 2791.14]  And he calls you
[2791.14 --> 2792.72]  to an unshakable
[2792.72 --> 2793.64]  trust in him.
[2795.00 --> 2796.10]  And so I ask you today
[2796.10 --> 2797.74]  will you cast
[2797.74 --> 2798.42]  your trust
[2798.42 --> 2799.46]  upon this Jesus?
[2800.74 --> 2801.92]  For the whole purpose
[2801.92 --> 2802.84]  of John's gospel
[2802.84 --> 2803.54]  is this.
[2804.40 --> 2805.30]  These are written
[2805.30 --> 2806.70]  that you may believe
[2806.70 --> 2807.48]  that Jesus
[2807.48 --> 2808.50]  is the Messiah
[2808.50 --> 2810.22]  the Son of God
[2810.22 --> 2811.60]  and that by believing
[2811.60 --> 2813.26]  you may have life
[2813.26 --> 2814.06]  in his name.
[2815.34 --> 2816.44]  Jesus is God
[2816.44 --> 2818.72]  and he deserves
[2818.72 --> 2820.12]  our total
[2820.12 --> 2821.60]  our absolute
[2821.60 --> 2822.64]  allegiance.
[2823.98 --> 2824.22]  Amen?
[2824.22 --> 2824.34]  Amen.
[2825.34 --> 2825.86]  Amen.
[2826.38 --> 2827.40]  Let's pray together.
[2832.36 --> 2833.52]  Father we thank you
[2833.52 --> 2834.66]  for hearing the cries
[2834.66 --> 2835.32]  of your people.
[2836.52 --> 2837.38]  We thank you
[2837.38 --> 2838.54]  for coming to us
[2838.54 --> 2839.64]  to coming
[2839.64 --> 2840.98]  becoming a man
[2840.98 --> 2842.16]  to take on flesh
[2842.16 --> 2843.52]  to enter this
[2843.52 --> 2844.32]  broken world
[2844.32 --> 2845.90]  and to come
[2845.90 --> 2846.78]  to us
[2846.78 --> 2847.52]  when we couldn't
[2847.52 --> 2848.12]  come to you.
[2848.56 --> 2849.90]  To reveal yourself
[2849.90 --> 2850.38]  to us
[2850.38 --> 2850.98]  when we couldn't
[2850.98 --> 2851.54]  find you.
[2851.54 --> 2853.78]  to tell us
[2853.78 --> 2854.42]  your true name.
[2855.82 --> 2856.22]  And Lord
[2856.22 --> 2857.20]  in hearing it
[2857.20 --> 2858.62]  would you
[2858.62 --> 2859.80]  turn our hearts
[2859.80 --> 2860.22]  to you?
[2860.34 --> 2860.68]  Would you
[2860.68 --> 2862.02]  enable us
[2862.02 --> 2863.14]  to enlarge
[2863.14 --> 2863.74]  our spirits
[2863.74 --> 2864.62]  to receive you
[2864.62 --> 2865.36]  to know you
[2865.36 --> 2866.48]  to worship you?
[2867.22 --> 2868.10]  We pray for your help
[2868.10 --> 2868.86]  in Jesus name.
[2869.50 --> 2869.80]  Amen.
[2871.50 --> 2872.02]  And so friends
[2872.02 --> 2872.38]  let's sing
[2872.38 --> 2873.48]  our song of response
[2873.48 --> 2874.46]  in Christ alone.
[2874.46 --> 2888.12]  in Christ alone
[2888.12 --> 2890.64]  my hope is found
[2890.64 --> 2892.28]  He is my light,
[2892.36 --> 2893.12]  my strength,
[2893.12 --> 2895.20]  my soul
[2895.20 --> 2897.62]  He's on a stone
[2897.62 --> 2900.30]  with solid ground
[2900.30 --> 2901.88]  found to the first
[2901.88 --> 2904.60]  of stone and stone
[2904.60 --> 2906.94]  one hands of love
[2906.94 --> 2909.50]  one hands of peace
[2909.50 --> 2911.86]  when fears are still
[2911.86 --> 2914.08]  when strength exists
[2914.08 --> 2915.66]  my comfort,
[2915.86 --> 2916.60]  all,
[2916.60 --> 2918.60]  my only love
[2919.26 --> 2922.54]  in the love of Christ
[2922.54 --> 2924.06]  I stand.
[2924.06 --> 2935.46]  in Christ alone
[2935.46 --> 2938.14]  who took on flesh
[2938.14 --> 2939.80]  fullness of God
[2939.80 --> 2942.72]  in endless pain
[2942.72 --> 2945.22]  these fields of love
[2945.22 --> 2946.72]  and righteousness
[2946.72 --> 2949.48]  scorned by the ones
[2949.48 --> 2952.40]  He came to save
[2952.40 --> 2955.02]  till on the cross
[2955.02 --> 2957.26]  the Lord Jesus died
[2957.26 --> 2959.96]  the love of God
[2959.96 --> 2960.88]  was satisfied
[2960.88 --> 2964.76]  for every single
[2964.76 --> 2967.22]  one who was made
[2967.22 --> 2970.64]  in the death of Christ
[2970.64 --> 2972.52]  I live
[2972.52 --> 2977.60]  Him
[2977.68 --> 2980.24]  Caused Jennifer
[2980.24 --> 2983.42]  He came to the end
[2983.42 --> 2984.22]  the land
[2984.22 --> 2986.04]  pans
[2986.04 --> 2986.60]  of the Chaos
[2986.60 --> 2988.08]  the company
[2988.08 --> 2991.00]  in Mensch
[2991.00 --> 2991.60]  had
[2992.84 --> 2994.84]  bis Info
[2994.84 --> 2997.60]  pechojas
[2997.60 --> 2999.04]  re
[2999.04 --> 3000.84]  back
[3000.84 --> 3010.98]  And as he stands in victory, since God has lost his grip on me,
[3011.36 --> 3021.38]  for I am his and he is mine, God with the precious blood of Christ.
[3030.84 --> 3040.16]  No guilt in life, no fear in death, this is the power of Christ in me.
[3040.16 --> 3049.08]  From my spirit's pride to find no breath, Jesus commands my destiny.
[3050.28 --> 3059.76]  No power of hell, no human plan, can never block me from his hand,
[3059.76 --> 3065.16]  till he returns or calls me home.
[3065.66 --> 3070.52]  In the power of Christ I stand.
[3084.08 --> 3088.78]  Friends, let's respond to God by going to the Lord in prayer.
[3088.78 --> 3089.98]  Would you please pray with me?
[3092.18 --> 3102.64]  Almighty God, to you, before you, all hearts are open and all desires are known.
[3103.60 --> 3106.40]  And from you no secrets are hidden.
[3107.58 --> 3110.78]  You know what this last year has been like for us.
[3110.78 --> 3116.68]  You know the wayward affections and the difficult decisions.
[3117.84 --> 3123.82]  You know the ways in which we have sought, however imperfectly, to love and to serve you.
[3124.42 --> 3130.34]  And to remember that in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, that you still sit on the throne.
[3130.74 --> 3132.64]  And you are worthy of our worship.
[3132.64 --> 3140.08]  But God, we honestly confess that there are many things beyond the scope of our wisdom.
[3141.36 --> 3143.82]  And Lord, sometimes our love grows thin.
[3143.82 --> 3154.16]  And so we turn to this coming year with the ways that we wish to continue to live for you and bless those around us.
[3154.70 --> 3161.04]  Lord, with our desires that we have for others, for family and friends and neighbors and colleagues,
[3161.04 --> 3165.58]  to come to a saving knowledge of who you are.
[3166.82 --> 3170.88]  And how the gospel would be proclaimed to the ends of the earth.
[3171.48 --> 3174.24]  And we ask that you would guide us in this in this coming year.
[3174.62 --> 3178.02]  Guide us as a church, as we reach out into our community.
[3178.78 --> 3182.28]  As we call people to find their life in Christ.
[3182.28 --> 3187.74]  We thank you that we don't have to be anxious for anything.
[3187.74 --> 3191.94]  But by prayer and petition, we can make our requests known to you.
[3192.04 --> 3197.14]  And that the peace of God which surpasses understanding will guard our hearts and minds in Christ.
[3198.26 --> 3203.20]  And as we think about this promise and the assurance in scripture,
[3203.82 --> 3210.16]  we want to lift up our community and our individual concerns to you.
[3210.16 --> 3213.90]  And so in this space of silence,
[3214.40 --> 3223.38]  we bring before you, Lord, our griefs and the hopes that we hope will come to us this year.
[3224.44 --> 3228.36]  Lord, hear these prayers of your people as we come before you.
[3240.16 --> 3253.24]  Thank you, Lord, that you hear the cries of your people.
[3254.12 --> 3257.98]  Thank you, Lord, that you have heard our hearts and our hopes.
[3259.40 --> 3263.64]  And Father, together we pray and we mourn the passing of our sister Kathy.
[3263.64 --> 3271.50]  We pray that you would comfort her family and friends and in her church community who grieve.
[3272.40 --> 3276.68]  Lord, we thank you that she is now in your eternal presence in heaven.
[3277.44 --> 3281.20]  And Lord, this was her great hope and even in the midst of her suffering,
[3281.76 --> 3283.62]  that she would be with you one day.
[3285.82 --> 3288.12]  And Lord, your mercies are ever new.
[3289.10 --> 3290.96]  Your compassion never fails.
[3290.96 --> 3295.16]  So in the name of Jesus, we pray all of these things.
[3295.98 --> 3297.70]  To the Lord who hears our prayers.
[3298.38 --> 3298.62]  Amen.
[3301.78 --> 3305.92]  And so friends, as we conclude our worship together,
[3306.84 --> 3310.30]  the Lord not only ministers to us, but he sends us out.
[3310.42 --> 3314.96]  He sends us to be his manifestation of who he is in the world,
[3315.04 --> 3316.56]  the epiphany of Jesus Christ.
[3316.56 --> 3321.34]  And so with that, I invite you to hold out your hands and receive this benediction.
[3322.42 --> 3324.70]  May Jesus Christ, the Son of Righteousness,
[3325.18 --> 3327.22]  who comes with healing in his wings,
[3327.96 --> 3330.92]  fill you with a joy and peace that passes all understanding.
[3331.84 --> 3335.60]  The blessing of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[3336.26 --> 3338.84]  be upon you and remain with you always.

[3369.62 --> 3375.34]  And unto the Lamb
[3375.34 --> 3381.28]  Rays and glory, wisdom and peace
[3381.28 --> 3386.54]  Honor and power and strength

[3413.54 --> 3419.54]  In purpose and unity
[3419.54 --> 3424.80]  Declaring our love
[3424.80 --> 3430.88]  Rays and glory, wisdom and peace
[3430.88 --> 3435.80]  Honor and power and strength
