[1799.34 → 1805.20] empire living
[1805.20 → 1812.48] or unconsciously, in practicing evil, in cooperation with works of darkness,
[1813.20 → 1820.52] or in any other way that is displeasing to you and not aligned with your heavenly kingdom,
[1821.24 → 1830.48] please forgive me, and please grant me the liberty of your Holy Spirit at work in this area of my
[1830.48 → 1837.50] life. So let's do that now. I invite you to take a moment to bring your heart, yourself before the
[1837.50 → 1838.96] Lord, knowing that he accepts you.
[1838.96 → 1863.08] And now comes the assurance of pardon where the Lord, after we have exposed our wounds,
[1863.08 → 1869.90] he takes the balm of the gospel and applies it exactly where we need it. So listen to these
[1869.90 → 1876.60] words and take these words to heart because they are the words of the Lord to you today in his grace.
[1877.82 → 1886.10] God will again have compassion on us. He will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins
[1886.10 → 1892.30] into the depths of the sea. Praise the Lord. Would you please rise again and let's sing our
[1892.30 → 1894.98] song of renewal? Please stand.
[1894.98 → 1924.96] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once
[1924.96 → 1935.96] was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see.
[1935.96 → 1959.70] T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved. How precious did the grace appear,
[1959.70 → 1985.52] the hour I first believed. My chains are gone, I've been set free. My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me. And like if Lord,
[1985.52 → 2012.52] His mercy reigns, unending life, amazing grace. The Lord has promised good to me. His word my all secures.
[2012.52 → 2042.50] He will my children portion be, as long as life detours. The earth shall soon dissolve like sun. The sun forbear to shine.
[2042.50 → 2058.50] My God, my God, my God, my God, my God, who called me here below, will free forever mine.
[2058.50 → 2065.50] My God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my Saviour, has ransomed me. And like a Lord, His mercy reigns.
[2065.50 → 2073.50] Unending love, amazing grace.
[2073.50 → 2075.50] When we've been there ten thousand years.
[2075.50 → 2077.50] When we've been there ten thousand years.
[2077.50 → 2078.50] Right shining eyes.
[2078.50 → 2090.30] His mercy remains, unending love, amazing grace.
[2090.30 → 2110.94] When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining eyes, this sun.
[2110.94 → 2125.08] We've no fewer days to sing God's praise than when we first began.
[2131.56 → 2137.58] And at this time we will send off the children to go to their classes.
[2140.94 → 2149.56] And so something that is not in our order of worship, in our bulletin, and that's my fault,
[2150.34 → 2155.56] is the fact that today we are installing our new office bearers.
[2155.92 → 2158.88] We had kind of put it off over a couple of weeks.
[2158.88 → 2162.16] I was gone and people were not available, but today we're all here.
[2162.56 → 2166.10] And so finally we are going to install our office bearers.
[2166.10 → 2175.16] So let me say some words of teaching instruction about the role of elders and deacons in the life of the church.
[2175.16 → 2181.66] So in the office bearers of the church we see the love of Christ for his people.
[2182.56 → 2192.96] As the Lord of the church, he appoints leaders to govern in his name and to promote the spiritual well-being of his people.
[2192.96 → 2201.64] By his spirit, he equips these leaders so that we as believers may grow in faith,
[2201.64 → 2205.12] that we may develop disciplined Christian living,
[2205.56 → 2212.34] that we may serve others in selfless love and share with all the good news of salvation.
[2212.34 → 2219.30] The apostle Paul states this clearly when he wrote to the church.
[2219.30 → 2219.88] He said,
[2219.88 → 2225.32] So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers
[2225.32 → 2232.18] to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up
[2232.18 → 2237.34] until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[2237.34 → 2242.62] and become a chore attaining to the full measure of Christ.
[2244.46 → 2253.44] And so elders and deacons, we have elders in our church, and they serve by exercising oversight of the church in Christ's name.
[2255.32 → 2260.94] Deacons serve by leading and equipping the church to minister to its members and the world
[2260.94 → 2263.52] in a rich diversity of ministries,
[2263.52 → 2268.78] awakening in his compassion, demonstrating mercy, seeking justice,
[2268.78 → 2274.34] and collaborating with God's spirit for the transformation of persons and communities.
[2277.48 → 2284.82] And so deacons and elders together with the ministers of the church
[2284.82 → 2289.66] are responsible for the general administration and the spiritual care of the church.
[2289.66 → 2295.68] And these tasks of elders and deacons call for believers who are Christ-like,
[2295.82 → 2296.96] who are mature in faith,
[2297.22 → 2301.14] and who exercise their offices with prayer, patience, and humility.
[2301.30 → 2306.34] And this is not to say that we're more spiritual or perfect, or they are,
[2306.50 → 2311.28] but that they do show some maturity in Christ.
[2311.86 → 2312.94] Okay, so now we're going to,
[2313.12 → 2316.94] I will invite our new office bearers to come forward
[2316.94 → 2321.02] and we will have them say their vows
[2321.02 → 2324.32] and we will ordain them and install them into their offices.
[2332.78 → 2334.60] Maybe stand over here.
[2334.60 → 2342.24] And so,
[2342.48 → 2344.12] I will say,
[2344.42 → 2345.44] read these vows,
[2345.66 → 2347.36] and then after I read them,
[2347.76 → 2349.34] I will ask you,
[2349.70 → 2350.86] each one at a time,
[2350.92 → 2351.84] for you to then respond.
[2352.22 → 2352.38] Okay?
[2352.58 → 2353.06] And again,
[2353.20 → 2353.50] saying,
[2353.70 → 2354.22] if you agree,
[2354.64 → 2355.26] I do,
[2355.82 → 2356.76] the Lord helping me.
[2357.26 → 2357.46] Okay?
[2357.62 → 2358.62] So here are the vows.
[2358.62 → 2364.74] To express your acceptance of these vows,
[2365.00 → 2367.40] you are asked to stand here and in the presence of God
[2367.40 → 2368.82] and his church
[2368.82 → 2370.46] to answer these questions.
[2371.04 → 2374.16] Do you believe that in the call of this congregation,
[2374.90 → 2376.80] God himself is calling you
[2376.80 → 2378.76] to these holy offices?
[2379.60 → 2382.02] Do you believe that the Old and New Testaments
[2382.02 → 2383.14] are the word of God,
[2383.46 → 2386.34] the only infallible rule of faith and life?
[2386.34 → 2390.86] Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church,
[2391.44 → 2393.78] rejecting all teaching which contradicts them?
[2394.54 → 2396.18] And do you promise to do the work
[2396.18 → 2398.42] of your offices faithfully
[2398.42 → 2401.86] and in a way worthy of your calling
[2401.86 → 2403.48] and in submission to the government
[2403.48 → 2405.28] and discipline of the church?
[2406.60 → 2407.08] And so,
[2408.22 → 2409.30] Michaela,
[2409.74 → 2410.74] what is your answer?
[2412.40 → 2413.30] You know what?
[2413.30 → 2413.86] Here.
[2416.34 → 2417.24] One more time.
[2418.00 → 2418.50] I do,
[2418.68 → 2419.28] God helping me.
[2419.46 → 2419.68] Okay.
[2420.48 → 2420.96] And John,
[2421.12 → 2422.12] what is your answer?
[2422.78 → 2423.22] I do,
[2423.36 → 2423.98] God helping me.
[2424.24 → 2424.42] Okay.
[2424.80 → 2425.18] And Kevin,
[2425.38 → 2426.20] what is your answer?
[2426.58 → 2427.00] I do,
[2427.12 → 2427.72] God helping me.
[2428.00 → 2428.32] Okay.
[2428.58 → 2429.06] Praise the Lord.
[2430.66 → 2431.10] So,
[2431.28 → 2432.02] I want to invite
[2432.02 → 2433.50] all of our council members,
[2433.64 → 2435.44] our current elders and deacons
[2435.44 → 2436.24] to come forward
[2436.24 → 2436.82] and
[2436.82 → 2437.98] we will
[2437.98 → 2439.14] support them
[2439.14 → 2439.78] and we will
[2439.78 → 2441.02] lay hands on them
[2441.02 → 2442.30] and
[2442.30 → 2443.06] install them
[2443.06 → 2443.82] into their offices.
[2444.46 → 2445.26] Please come on up.
[2449.76 → 2450.20] Yeah,
[2450.26 → 2450.52] thanks.
[2456.06 → 2456.50] Oh,
[2456.54 → 2456.78] and so,
[2456.86 → 2457.70] I didn't say this already.
[2458.04 → 2458.38] John,
[2458.54 → 2459.52] sorry,
[2459.90 → 2460.76] will be installed
[2460.76 → 2461.32] as an elder
[2461.32 → 2462.36] and Michaela
[2462.36 → 2462.94] and Kevin
[2462.94 → 2463.86] will be installed
[2463.86 → 2464.46] as deacons.
[2464.46 → 2468.42] So,
[2468.50 → 2469.30] we'll lay hands on them.
[2470.74 → 2471.08] God,
[2471.20 → 2472.22] our heavenly Father,
[2473.14 → 2474.46] who has called you
[2474.46 → 2476.26] to these sacred offices,
[2477.22 → 2477.82] guide you
[2477.82 → 2478.54] by his word,
[2479.54 → 2480.38] equip you
[2480.38 → 2481.32] with his spirit
[2481.32 → 2482.94] and so prosper
[2482.94 → 2483.98] your ministries
[2483.98 → 2485.60] that his church
[2485.60 → 2487.22] may increase
[2487.22 → 2488.90] and his name
[2488.90 → 2489.44] be praised.
[2490.46 → 2490.80] Amen.
[2490.80 → 2494.10] So,
[2494.18 → 2494.30] yeah,
[2494.42 → 2494.80] you go ahead
[2494.80 → 2495.22] and be seated
[2495.22 → 2495.94] and then I will
[2495.94 → 2496.74] give a charge
[2496.74 → 2497.46] to
[2497.46 → 2499.44] our elder,
[2499.62 → 2499.92] John,
[2499.98 → 2501.08] and our deacons.
[2502.32 → 2502.76] So,
[2502.86 → 2503.14] to you,
[2503.18 → 2503.48] John,
[2503.84 → 2504.44] as elder,
[2505.00 → 2505.94] you are a shepherd
[2505.94 → 2506.54] of the flock.
[2507.80 → 2508.74] I charge you
[2508.74 → 2509.52] to hold firmly
[2509.52 → 2510.88] to the trustworthy message
[2510.88 → 2512.18] as it has been taught
[2512.18 → 2513.48] so that you can
[2513.48 → 2514.30] encourage others
[2514.30 → 2515.28] by sound doctrine
[2515.28 → 2516.62] and refute those
[2516.62 → 2517.32] who oppose it.
[2518.30 → 2519.04] Be a friend
[2519.04 → 2520.24] and Christ-like example
[2520.24 → 2521.00] to children.
[2522.06 → 2522.80] Give clear
[2522.80 → 2523.86] and cheerful guidance
[2523.86 → 2524.64] to young people.
[2525.60 → 2526.82] By word and example,
[2527.02 → 2528.34] bear up God's people
[2528.34 → 2529.20] in their pain
[2529.20 → 2529.88] and weakness
[2529.88 → 2531.34] and celebrate
[2531.34 → 2532.70] their joys with them.
[2533.40 → 2534.16] Hold and trust
[2534.16 → 2535.24] all sensitive matters
[2535.24 → 2536.22] confided to you.
[2536.96 → 2537.98] Encourage the aged
[2537.98 → 2539.26] to persevere
[2539.26 → 2540.18] in God's promises.
[2541.30 → 2541.82] Be wise,
[2542.02 → 2543.10] be a wise counsellor
[2543.10 → 2544.38] who supports
[2544.38 → 2545.30] and strengthens
[2545.30 → 2546.16] the pastor.
[2547.30 → 2548.50] Be compassionate
[2548.50 → 2549.56] yet firm
[2549.56 → 2550.32] and consistent
[2550.32 → 2551.08] in rebuke
[2551.08 → 2551.70] and discipline.
[2553.86 → 2555.12] And to the deacons,
[2555.26 → 2555.90] Michaela and Kevin,
[2556.30 → 2557.04] I charge you
[2557.04 → 2557.58] as deacons
[2557.58 → 2558.76] to inspire
[2558.76 → 2559.78] faithful ministries
[2559.78 → 2560.48] of service
[2560.48 → 2561.94] for us
[2561.94 → 2562.68] to one another,
[2562.90 → 2564.16] to the larger community
[2564.16 → 2564.74] around us
[2564.74 → 2565.40] and to the world.
[2566.18 → 2566.94] Remind us
[2566.94 → 2567.46] that the Lord
[2567.46 → 2568.28] requires us
[2568.28 → 2569.18] to act justly
[2569.18 → 2570.74] and to love mercy
[2570.74 → 2571.80] and to walk humbly
[2571.80 → 2572.64] with our God.
[2573.24 → 2574.42] Help us to be merciful
[2574.42 → 2576.14] and seize new opportunities
[2576.14 → 2577.16] to worship God
[2577.16 → 2578.34] with offerings
[2578.34 → 2579.70] of our wealth,
[2579.82 → 2580.40] our time,
[2580.48 → 2581.18] and our abilities.
[2582.20 → 2583.36] Help us to realize
[2583.36 → 2584.52] that benevolence
[2584.52 → 2585.20] is a quality
[2585.20 → 2586.38] of our life in Christ.
[2588.20 → 2588.56] Therefore,
[2588.80 → 2589.74] minister to rich
[2589.74 → 2590.54] and poor alike,
[2591.24 → 2592.08] both within
[2592.08 → 2593.32] and outside the church.
[2595.88 → 2596.96] Help us to look
[2596.96 → 2597.62] to the interests
[2597.62 → 2598.14] of others
[2598.14 → 2599.48] and in all of your ministries,
[2599.62 → 2600.62] help us participate
[2600.62 → 2601.40] in the renewal
[2601.40 → 2602.40] of all things
[2602.40 → 2603.86] as we anticipate
[2603.86 → 2604.70] its completion
[2604.70 → 2606.92] when God's kingdom comes.
[2608.14 → 2608.26] Okay.
[2609.12 → 2609.60] And to you,
[2609.66 → 2610.34] the congregation,
[2610.72 → 2611.78] I charge you,
[2611.88 → 2612.68] people of God,
[2612.90 → 2614.80] to receive these office bearers
[2614.80 → 2616.04] as Christ's gift
[2616.04 → 2616.72] to the church.
[2617.54 → 2618.48] Would you recognize
[2618.48 → 2619.12] in them
[2619.12 → 2620.10] the Lord's provision
[2620.10 → 2621.14] for healthy
[2621.14 → 2622.38] congregational life?
[2623.14 → 2624.06] Hold them in honour.
[2624.94 → 2625.82] Take their counsel
[2625.82 → 2626.72] seriously.
[2627.66 → 2628.60] Respond to them
[2628.60 → 2629.38] with obedience
[2629.38 → 2630.18] and respect.
[2631.28 → 2632.08] Accept their help
[2632.08 → 2632.70] with thanks.
[2633.74 → 2634.86] Wholeheartedly participate
[2634.86 → 2636.36] in the ministries
[2636.36 → 2638.26] into which they lead you.
[2639.42 → 2640.50] Sustain them in prayer
[2640.50 → 2642.38] and encourage them
[2642.38 → 2643.14] with your support,
[2643.94 → 2645.12] especially when they feel
[2645.12 → 2645.58] the burden
[2645.58 → 2646.54] of their office.
[2647.40 → 2648.06] Acknowledge them
[2648.06 → 2649.48] as the Lord's servants
[2649.48 → 2650.10] among you.
[2650.64 → 2651.08] And so,
[2651.22 → 2651.98] here's the vow
[2651.98 → 2652.56] you will take.
[2652.66 → 2653.66] Do you, congregation,
[2654.44 → 2655.78] pledge to receive them
[2655.78 → 2657.46] as you have been charged?
[2657.52 → 2658.08] If so, say,
[2658.20 → 2658.52] we do,
[2658.62 → 2659.44] God helping us.
[2660.22 → 2660.84] We do,
[2661.00 → 2662.00] God helping us.
[2662.08 → 2665.18] Let me pray for us.
[2666.86 → 2668.08] Our merciful Father
[2668.08 → 2668.52] in heaven,
[2668.64 → 2669.22] we thank you
[2669.22 → 2670.60] that you have provided
[2670.60 → 2672.52] faithful and gifted people
[2672.52 → 2673.16] to serve you
[2673.16 → 2674.38] as elders and deacons.
[2675.12 → 2676.98] As these new office bearers
[2676.98 → 2678.48] assume their responsibilities,
[2679.44 → 2680.60] fill them with your spirit,
[2680.86 → 2682.48] endow them with your wisdom
[2682.48 → 2683.28] and grant them
[2683.28 → 2684.22] your strength.
[2685.04 → 2685.30] Lord,
[2685.34 → 2685.94] would you make them
[2685.94 → 2686.90] faithful workers
[2686.90 → 2687.82] in your vineyard.
[2687.82 → 2690.30] under their guidance,
[2690.76 → 2691.66] may your church,
[2691.80 → 2692.64] Latin or CRC,
[2692.76 → 2693.82] grow in every
[2693.82 → 2695.18] spiritual grace,
[2695.78 → 2697.46] in faith which is open
[2697.46 → 2698.28] and unashamed,
[2698.94 → 2700.30] and in the committed service
[2700.30 → 2702.14] that promotes your reign
[2702.14 → 2702.96] and your glory
[2702.96 → 2703.70] in the world.
[2704.18 → 2704.64] Help us,
[2704.70 → 2705.12] your people,
[2705.20 → 2706.18] to accept them gladly,
[2706.30 → 2707.54] to encourage them always,
[2707.88 → 2708.76] and respect them
[2708.76 → 2709.40] for the sake
[2709.40 → 2710.70] of your Son,
[2710.76 → 2711.80] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2711.92 → 2713.00] in whose name we pray.
[2713.86 → 2714.18] Amen.
[2716.06 → 2716.62] I think,
[2716.76 → 2717.16] let's give them
[2717.16 → 2717.84] a round of applause.
[2718.00 → 2718.54] Would that be appropriate?
[2721.60 → 2722.04] All right,
[2722.28 → 2722.86] you may be seated.
[2722.86 → 2722.96] Thank you.
[2743.00 → 2758.26] Excuse me a moment.
[2760.64 → 2761.00] So,
[2761.60 → 2763.10] come before the Lord
[2763.10 → 2763.92] to hear His word
[2763.92 → 2764.56] now this morning.
[2765.58 → 2765.82] You know,
[2765.88 → 2766.74] and as many of you
[2766.74 → 2767.20] will know,
[2767.72 → 2768.16] this summer
[2768.16 → 2768.90] we have been preaching
[2768.90 → 2770.30] through a sermon series
[2770.30 → 2771.66] in the Psalms of Ascent.
[2772.60 → 2772.72] Right?
[2772.72 → 2774.74] And these are 15 psalms
[2774.74 → 2775.64] that we believe
[2775.64 → 2776.14] were sung
[2776.14 → 2777.54] by the ancient Israelites
[2777.54 → 2779.76] as they made their way annually
[2779.76 → 2781.78] to Jerusalem
[2781.78 → 2783.80] to worship the Lord
[2783.80 → 2785.10] and to feast with Him
[2785.10 → 2786.38] in that holy city.
[2786.58 → 2787.20] And this, again,
[2787.24 → 2787.50] would have been
[2787.50 → 2789.44] a long and arduous journey
[2789.44 → 2790.20] that they would take
[2790.20 → 2791.16] and they would sing
[2791.16 → 2792.50] these songs as they went.
[2792.70 → 2794.16] And so we're calling this series
[2794.16 → 2795.44] Songs for the Journey.
[2795.94 → 2796.58] And what they do
[2796.58 → 2797.26] is they teach us
[2797.26 → 2798.36] what it means to be
[2798.36 → 2799.94] Jesus' disciples
[2799.94 → 2801.00] today
[2801.00 → 2802.30] in our own lives.
[2802.30 → 2804.04] So today
[2804.04 → 2805.46] we are in
[2805.46 → 2806.26] Psalm 127
[2806.26 → 2808.14] and the theme
[2808.14 → 2809.52] of this psalm
[2809.52 → 2810.74] is work.
[2811.34 → 2811.50] Okay?
[2811.56 → 2812.26] The theme is work.
[2812.36 → 2813.92] So let's give our attention
[2813.92 → 2814.44] to the reading
[2814.44 → 2815.46] of God's holy word
[2815.46 → 2816.06] this morning.
[2817.16 → 2818.28] Psalm 127
[2818.28 → 2820.36] A Song of Ascents
[2820.36 → 2821.20] of Solomon
[2821.20 → 2823.66] Unless the Lord
[2823.66 → 2824.74] builds the house
[2824.74 → 2825.96] the builders
[2825.96 → 2826.90] labour in vain.
[2827.72 → 2828.70] Unless the Lord
[2828.70 → 2829.96] watches over the city
[2829.96 → 2831.44] the guards
[2831.44 → 2832.52] stand watch in vain.
[2833.48 → 2834.10] In vain
[2834.10 → 2835.12] you rise early
[2835.12 → 2836.20] and stay up late
[2836.20 → 2837.70] toiling for food
[2837.70 → 2838.30] to eat
[2838.30 → 2840.20] for he grants sleep
[2840.20 → 2841.24] to those he loves.
[2842.70 → 2843.34] Children
[2843.34 → 2844.14] are a heritage
[2844.14 → 2844.86] from the Lord
[2844.86 → 2846.44] offspring
[2846.44 → 2847.30] a reward
[2847.30 → 2848.02] from him.
[2848.18 → 2849.68] Like arrows
[2849.68 → 2850.30] in the hands
[2850.30 → 2850.90] of a warrior
[2850.90 → 2851.56] are children
[2851.56 → 2852.82] born in one's youth.
[2853.76 → 2854.60] Blessed is the man
[2854.60 → 2855.16] whose quiver
[2855.16 → 2856.02] is full of them.
[2856.58 → 2857.54] They will not be put
[2857.54 → 2858.08] to shame
[2858.08 → 2859.12] when they contend
[2859.12 → 2859.98] with their opponents
[2859.98 → 2861.04] in the court.
[2861.04 → 2862.60] This is the word
[2862.60 → 2863.04] of the Lord.
[2863.82 → 2864.70] Thanks be to God.
[2864.98 → 2865.74] Would you pray with me?
[2868.44 → 2869.88] Lord we thank you
[2869.88 → 2871.16] this morning
[2871.16 → 2872.00] that you have called us
[2872.00 → 2873.12] again into your presence.
[2873.52 → 2874.76] That you have called us
[2874.76 → 2876.32] together
[2876.32 → 2877.30] one another's
[2877.30 → 2878.04] brothers and sisters
[2878.04 → 2878.66] in Christ.
[2880.04 → 2880.68] And Lord
[2880.68 → 2881.32] that we were able
[2881.32 → 2882.04] to praise you
[2882.04 → 2883.22] to confess our sins
[2883.22 → 2884.22] to hear your words
[2884.22 → 2884.92] of assurance.
[2885.44 → 2886.36] Lord to celebrate
[2886.36 → 2887.16] and to install
[2887.16 → 2888.26] these office bearers
[2888.26 → 2889.22] that you have given us.
[2889.28 → 2889.94] We don't take that
[2889.94 → 2890.40] for granted.
[2891.10 → 2892.46] It is a huge blessing
[2892.46 → 2893.78] to us as a church.
[2895.18 → 2895.54] And Lord
[2895.54 → 2897.96] in all of these things
[2897.96 → 2898.56] we need
[2898.56 → 2900.00] your word to us.
[2900.26 → 2901.24] And as we were reminded
[2901.24 → 2902.18] your word
[2902.18 → 2903.04] is infallible.
[2903.20 → 2904.14] It is the only rule
[2904.14 → 2905.04] of faith in life.
[2906.32 → 2906.94] So Lord
[2906.94 → 2907.72] we come together
[2907.72 → 2910.70] because of Christ
[2910.70 → 2911.30] and found it
[2911.30 → 2912.00] upon your word.
[2912.10 → 2912.48] And so Lord
[2912.48 → 2913.60] would you teach us
[2913.60 → 2913.98] this morning?
[2914.08 → 2914.50] Would you open
[2914.50 → 2915.52] your word to us?
[2915.82 → 2916.54] As we read
[2916.54 → 2917.26] Psalm 127
[2917.26 → 2918.46] help us to see
[2918.46 → 2919.24] what you would
[2919.24 → 2919.78] have to say
[2919.78 → 2920.30] to us.
[2921.00 → 2921.58] Lord we pray
[2921.58 → 2922.14] all these things
[2922.14 → 2922.90] in your holy name.
[2923.42 → 2923.74] Amen.
[2924.86 → 2926.04] So back in
[2926.04 → 2927.12] the 50s
[2927.12 → 2928.14] and 60s
[2928.14 → 2928.66] kind of earlier
[2928.66 → 2929.66] in the 20th century
[2929.66 → 2932.08] a number of people
[2932.08 → 2932.56] well first
[2932.56 → 2933.38] were just fighting
[2933.38 → 2934.76] for
[2934.76 → 2936.82] a 40-hour work week.
[2936.98 → 2937.72] Before then
[2937.72 → 2938.58] people would work
[2938.58 → 2939.96] really long hours.
[2941.54 → 2941.88] And so
[2941.88 → 2942.78] people wanted to
[2942.78 → 2943.22] like kind of
[2943.22 → 2943.40] you know
[2943.40 → 2944.10] we need to bring in
[2944.10 → 2945.52] some work-life balance.
[2945.52 → 2947.08] so there was
[2947.08 → 2948.20] a 40-hour work week.
[2948.52 → 2948.76] And then
[2948.76 → 2949.50] people later
[2949.50 → 2950.32] were predicting
[2950.32 → 2951.64] the end of the
[2951.64 → 2952.70] 40 hour work week
[2952.70 → 2954.40] because of
[2954.40 → 2955.22] modern technology
[2955.22 → 2956.14] they said basically
[2956.14 → 2958.00] that modern technology
[2958.00 → 2958.58] was going to
[2958.58 → 2959.46] set us free
[2959.46 → 2960.50] from work.
[2960.90 → 2961.40] We wouldn't have
[2961.40 → 2962.06] to work anymore.
[2963.02 → 2963.32] And you know
[2963.32 → 2964.04] maybe some of us
[2964.04 → 2964.60] would say
[2964.60 → 2965.88] amen
[2965.88 → 2966.80] to that.
[2967.86 → 2968.10] You know
[2968.10 → 2969.06] and a few days ago
[2969.06 → 2969.84] I read a
[2969.84 → 2970.78] news article
[2970.78 → 2972.14] that talked about
[2972.14 → 2973.18] how Elon Musk
[2973.18 → 2974.34] the CEO of Tesla
[2974.34 → 2975.06] has predicted
[2975.06 → 2976.28] that in the near future
[2976.28 → 2977.40] AI
[2977.40 → 2978.86] artificial intelligence
[2978.86 → 2979.84] will replace
[2979.84 → 2980.50] most jobs.
[2982.02 → 2983.20] But so far
[2983.20 → 2984.22] as it turns out
[2984.22 → 2985.08] these predictions
[2985.08 → 2986.66] have been
[2986.66 → 2987.62] entirely wrong.
[2988.80 → 2988.94] Right?
[2989.00 → 2989.40] In fact
[2989.40 → 2990.18] it seems the case
[2990.18 → 2991.36] that modern technology
[2991.36 → 2993.26] doesn't mean
[2993.26 → 2993.98] for us now
[2993.98 → 2994.94] less work
[2994.94 → 2995.96] but
[2995.96 → 2997.58] more work.
[2998.72 → 2999.04] You know
[2999.04 → 3000.08] and we've seen this
[3000.08 → 3000.84] during the pandemic
[3000.84 → 3001.50] in particular
[3001.50 → 3002.50] we have this
[3002.50 → 3003.44] great technology
[3003.44 → 3004.10] Zoom
[3004.10 → 3005.00] who knew
[3005.00 → 3005.40] what Zoom
[3005.40 → 3005.60] was
[3005.60 → 3005.88] but now
[3005.88 → 3006.16] we're all
[3006.16 → 3006.72] experts on
[3006.72 → 3007.08] Zoom
[3007.08 → 3008.06] and Zoom
[3008.06 → 3009.14] has enabled
[3009.14 → 3010.22] people to work
[3010.22 → 3010.68] from home
[3010.68 → 3011.14] and so that's
[3011.14 → 3011.60] brought
[3011.60 → 3012.46] some great
[3012.46 → 3012.90] benefits
[3012.90 → 3013.88] some flexibility
[3013.88 → 3015.00] in a lot
[3015.00 → 3015.66] of great ways
[3015.66 → 3016.68] but then we've seen
[3016.68 → 3017.52] that the downside
[3017.52 → 3018.16] of that
[3018.16 → 3018.98] is that
[3018.98 → 3019.86] it has blurred
[3019.86 → 3020.90] the separation
[3020.90 → 3022.88] and the distinction
[3022.88 → 3024.24] between home life
[3024.24 → 3025.66] and work life
[3025.66 → 3027.00] and now people
[3027.00 → 3027.76] are saying
[3027.76 → 3028.54] and they're feeling
[3028.54 → 3029.54] that they're
[3029.54 → 3030.56] always working
[3030.56 → 3031.60] forget the 40 hour
[3031.60 → 3032.24] work week
[3032.24 → 3033.08] it feels like
[3033.08 → 3033.96] we're always on
[3033.96 → 3034.94] we're always connected
[3034.94 → 3036.38] the boss can always
[3036.38 → 3037.06] reach us
[3037.06 → 3038.28] we're always working
[3038.28 → 3039.90] and so for over
[3039.90 → 3040.74] the last year
[3040.74 → 3041.44] and a half
[3041.44 → 3042.80] many people
[3042.80 → 3044.10] have been
[3044.10 → 3044.52] kind of just
[3044.52 → 3046.00] reconsidering
[3046.00 → 3047.14] work
[3047.14 → 3048.24] they've been
[3048.24 → 3049.36] thinking about
[3049.36 → 3051.30] the place
[3051.30 → 3052.24] that work
[3052.24 → 3053.36] has
[3053.36 → 3054.28] in our lives
[3054.28 → 3055.22] you know
[3055.22 → 3056.08] and we've seen
[3056.08 → 3057.22] this great
[3057.22 → 3057.92] resignation
[3057.92 → 3058.52] you know
[3058.52 → 3058.72] like
[3058.72 → 3059.36] what I mean
[3059.36 → 3059.66] is like
[3059.66 → 3060.22] many people
[3060.22 → 3060.76] resigning
[3060.76 → 3061.58] from their jobs
[3061.58 → 3061.82] you know
[3061.82 → 3062.30] we read that
[3062.30 → 3062.82] in the news
[3062.82 → 3064.78] some businesses
[3064.78 → 3065.66] can't find enough
[3065.66 → 3066.22] workers
[3066.22 → 3066.54] you know
[3066.54 → 3066.90] I just saw
[3066.90 → 3067.36] in the news
[3067.36 → 3067.64] you know
[3067.64 → 3068.16] in Whistler
[3068.16 → 3068.80] they're saying
[3068.80 → 3069.80] good luck
[3069.80 → 3070.78] getting a restaurant
[3070.78 → 3071.58] table on a Tuesday
[3071.58 → 3071.92] night
[3071.92 → 3072.84] there just probably
[3072.84 → 3073.48] won't be enough
[3073.48 → 3074.84] people to serve
[3074.84 → 3075.04] us
[3075.04 → 3075.48] to cook
[3075.48 → 3076.20] and you know
[3076.20 → 3076.60] there's a
[3076.60 → 3078.02] people are resigning
[3078.02 → 3078.50] their jobs
[3078.50 → 3079.84] people are relocating
[3079.84 → 3080.60] they're moving
[3080.60 → 3081.16] they're out of
[3081.16 → 3081.98] expensive cities
[3081.98 → 3082.42] they're moving
[3082.42 → 3083.64] maybe closer to family
[3083.64 → 3085.36] it's causing
[3085.36 → 3086.56] houses prices
[3086.56 → 3087.60] all over North America
[3087.60 → 3088.26] to go up
[3088.26 → 3089.22] so just
[3089.22 → 3089.66] during this
[3089.66 → 3089.94] pandemic
[3089.94 → 3090.40] we've seen
[3090.40 → 3090.76] people
[3090.76 → 3091.52] this turmoil
[3091.52 → 3092.66] over our work
[3092.66 → 3093.26] and our labours
[3093.26 → 3093.78] in the world
[3093.78 → 3095.26] what does it
[3095.26 → 3095.82] all mean
[3095.82 → 3096.64] you know
[3096.64 → 3097.14] and even as
[3097.14 → 3097.54] Christians
[3097.54 → 3098.04] we often
[3098.04 → 3098.74] have questions
[3098.74 → 3099.62] about our work
[3099.62 → 3100.60] you know
[3100.60 → 3101.40] like I get
[3101.40 → 3102.30] how going to
[3102.30 → 3103.24] church on Sunday
[3103.24 → 3104.06] is about following
[3104.06 → 3104.50] Jesus
[3104.50 → 3105.00] I mean
[3105.00 → 3105.18] you know
[3105.18 → 3105.54] I can bind
[3105.54 → 3105.72] of see
[3105.72 → 3106.32] the connection
[3106.32 → 3108.30] but what about
[3108.30 → 3108.80] the rest
[3108.80 → 3109.40] of the week
[3109.40 → 3110.14] like
[3110.14 → 3111.06] what is
[3111.06 → 3111.56] the meaning
[3111.56 → 3112.30] of everything
[3112.30 → 3112.98] else
[3112.98 → 3113.70] I do
[3113.70 → 3114.42] in life
[3114.42 → 3115.12] as a Christian
[3115.12 → 3116.70] what does it
[3116.70 → 3117.16] mean to be
[3117.16 → 3117.94] God's people
[3117.94 → 3118.88] labouring
[3118.88 → 3119.62] and working
[3119.62 → 3121.40] in the world
[3121.40 → 3122.56] and that doesn't
[3122.56 → 3123.28] it doesn't matter
[3123.28 → 3123.72] if you're just
[3123.72 → 3124.56] starting a career
[3124.56 → 3125.94] if you've
[3125.94 → 3126.88] you're at the
[3126.88 → 3127.84] end of your career
[3127.84 → 3128.90] but whatever we do
[3128.90 → 3129.42] in the world
[3129.42 → 3130.14] and the question is
[3130.14 → 3130.92] how do we labour
[3130.92 → 3131.72] as God's people
[3131.72 → 3133.24] in the world
[3133.24 → 3135.12] well
[3135.12 → 3136.08] Psalm 127
[3136.08 → 3137.56] tells us
[3137.56 → 3139.56] why we often
[3139.56 → 3140.84] feel like
[3140.84 → 3141.92] we are busier
[3141.92 → 3142.42] than ever
[3142.42 → 3143.28] we're
[3143.28 → 3144.34] more exhausted
[3144.34 → 3144.96] than ever
[3144.96 → 3146.68] and it shows us
[3146.68 → 3148.38] as pilgrims
[3148.38 → 3149.36] on this journey
[3149.36 → 3149.98] to our heavenly
[3149.98 → 3150.38] home
[3150.38 → 3151.24] it shows us
[3151.24 → 3151.74] how we can
[3151.74 → 3152.22] make work
[3152.22 → 3152.98] part of our
[3152.98 → 3153.96] Christian discipleship
[3153.96 → 3154.90] it shows us
[3154.90 → 3156.10] how we can be
[3156.10 → 3157.10] disciples
[3157.10 → 3157.94] who follow Jesus
[3157.94 → 3158.66] and who labour
[3158.66 → 3159.62] in the world
[3159.62 → 3161.94] as part of
[3161.94 → 3163.32] what it means
[3163.32 → 3164.18] to follow Jesus
[3164.18 → 3165.68] and so here's
[3165.68 → 3166.40] the big idea
[3166.40 → 3166.96] I think that
[3166.96 → 3168.52] Psalm 127
[3168.52 → 3169.62] is telling us
[3169.62 → 3171.90] it is calling
[3171.90 → 3172.38] us
[3172.38 → 3173.68] to work hard
[3173.68 → 3175.34] with a restful
[3175.34 → 3175.80] heart
[3175.80 → 3176.76] to build
[3176.76 → 3177.08] what God
[3177.08 → 3177.54] is building
[3177.54 → 3178.72] let me say
[3178.72 → 3179.12] that again
[3179.12 → 3180.06] here's the big
[3180.06 → 3180.38] idea
[3180.38 → 3181.86] it is calling
[3181.86 → 3182.70] us to work
[3182.70 → 3183.34] hard
[3183.34 → 3184.94] with a restful
[3184.94 → 3185.36] heart
[3185.36 → 3186.32] to build
[3186.32 → 3186.68] what God
[3186.68 → 3187.18] is building
[3187.18 → 3188.62] that's what
[3188.62 → 3188.88] I want to
[3188.88 → 3189.22] talk about
[3189.22 → 3189.54] today
[3189.54 → 3189.86] that's why
[3189.86 → 3190.10] I think
[3190.10 → 3190.70] Psalm 127
[3190.70 → 3191.54] is teaching
[3191.54 → 3191.88] us
[3191.88 → 3193.72] so let's
[3193.72 → 3194.00] look at
[3194.00 → 3194.40] those two
[3194.40 → 3194.86] things
[3194.86 → 3195.30] we're just
[3195.30 → 3195.46] going to
[3195.46 → 3195.76] look at
[3195.76 → 3196.00] this
[3196.00 → 3196.58] in two
[3196.58 → 3197.00] parts
[3197.00 → 3197.40] what does
[3197.40 → 3197.60] it means
[3197.60 → 3197.92] to work
[3197.92 → 3198.14] hard
[3198.14 → 3198.70] with a restful
[3198.70 → 3199.00] heart
[3199.00 → 3199.38] and that's
[3199.38 → 3199.68] the first
[3199.68 → 3199.82] thing
[3199.82 → 3200.02] I want
[3200.02 → 3200.34] to talk
[3200.34 → 3200.58] about
[3200.58 → 3201.76] and this
[3201.76 → 3202.18] phrase
[3202.18 → 3202.80] comes from
[3202.80 → 3203.18] the late
[3203.18 → 3203.84] Presbyterian
[3203.84 → 3204.22] minister
[3204.22 → 3204.90] Jack Miller
[3204.90 → 3207.26] and he used
[3207.26 → 3207.56] to say
[3207.56 → 3207.92] that
[3207.92 → 3209.34] work hard
[3209.34 → 3210.76] with a restful
[3210.76 → 3211.12] heart
[3211.12 → 3212.08] and I think
[3212.08 → 3212.48] if we
[3212.48 → 3213.30] think about
[3213.30 → 3213.52] that
[3213.52 → 3213.74] and we
[3213.74 → 3214.08] ponder
[3214.08 → 3214.34] that
[3214.34 → 3214.58] it's
[3214.58 → 3214.88] actually
[3214.88 → 3215.20] quite
[3215.20 → 3215.70] profound
[3215.70 → 3217.34] it actually
[3217.34 → 3218.04] is
[3218.04 → 3219.58] the way
[3219.58 → 3220.22] that God
[3220.22 → 3221.48] wants us
[3221.48 → 3221.88] to be
[3221.88 → 3222.20] and work
[3222.20 → 3222.46] in this
[3222.46 → 3222.84] world
[3222.84 → 3224.28] that we've
[3224.28 → 3224.68] got to
[3224.68 → 3225.62] work hard
[3225.62 → 3226.14] but
[3226.14 → 3227.20] with restful
[3227.20 → 3227.60] hearts
[3227.60 → 3228.72] and so
[3228.72 → 3229.04] as we
[3229.04 → 3229.32] look at
[3229.32 → 3229.92] Psalm 127
[3229.92 → 3230.56] I think
[3230.56 → 3231.24] Psalm 127
[3231.24 → 3231.98] makes it
[3231.98 → 3232.52] clear that
[3232.52 → 3233.56] work itself
[3233.56 → 3234.72] is not
[3234.72 → 3235.26] the problem
[3235.26 → 3236.90] one of the
[3236.90 → 3237.28] things we
[3237.28 → 3237.78] learn like
[3237.78 → 3238.26] right back
[3238.26 → 3238.64] in the very
[3238.64 → 3239.64] early chapters
[3239.64 → 3240.28] of Genesis
[3240.28 → 3241.66] is that
[3241.66 → 3242.42] work is
[3242.42 → 3243.10] part of
[3243.10 → 3243.64] God's
[3243.64 → 3244.72] good creation
[3244.72 → 3245.64] right
[3245.64 → 3246.00] in fact
[3246.00 → 3246.30] as we
[3246.30 → 3246.60] look at
[3246.60 → 3247.26] Genesis 1
[3247.26 → 3247.72] it tells
[3247.72 → 3248.12] us the
[3248.12 → 3248.60] story
[3248.60 → 3250.24] of
[3250.24 → 3251.04] creation
[3251.04 → 3251.46] with
[3251.46 → 3252.24] God
[3252.24 → 3253.44] as the
[3253.44 → 3253.76] worker
[3253.76 → 3254.02] right
[3254.02 → 3254.54] God is
[3254.54 → 3254.98] working
[3254.98 → 3255.64] God
[3255.64 → 3255.80] is
[3255.80 → 3256.02] always
[3256.02 → 3256.28] doing
[3256.28 → 3256.68] stuff
[3256.68 → 3257.16] God
[3257.16 → 3257.62] works
[3257.62 → 3257.80] for
[3257.80 → 3258.08] six
[3258.08 → 3258.46] days
[3258.46 → 3258.62] and
[3258.62 → 3258.74] then
[3258.74 → 3258.98] he
[3258.98 → 3259.60] rests
[3259.60 → 3259.78] on
[3259.78 → 3259.92] the
[3259.92 → 3260.20] seventh
[3260.20 → 3260.54] day
[3260.54 → 3260.94] and
[3260.94 → 3261.10] this
[3261.10 → 3261.26] is
[3261.26 → 3261.72] before
[3261.72 → 3262.20] sin
[3262.20 → 3262.64] came
[3262.64 → 3263.16] God
[3263.16 → 3263.32] is
[3263.32 → 3263.68] working
[3263.68 → 3264.02] God
[3264.02 → 3264.18] is
[3264.18 → 3264.54] resting
[3264.54 → 3265.42] rest
[3265.42 → 3265.66] is
[3265.66 → 3266.00] good
[3266.00 → 3266.78] work
[3266.78 → 3267.04] is
[3267.04 → 3267.40] good
[3267.40 → 3268.58] and
[3268.58 → 3268.76] then
[3268.76 → 3269.12] God
[3269.12 → 3269.58] created
[3269.58 → 3269.90] Adam
[3269.90 → 3270.06] and
[3270.06 → 3270.50] Eve
[3270.50 → 3270.92] and
[3270.92 → 3271.08] then
[3271.08 → 3271.58] through
[3271.58 → 3272.20] them
[3272.20 → 3272.58] gave
[3272.58 → 3272.78] to
[3272.78 → 3273.10] all
[3273.10 → 3273.28] of
[3273.28 → 3273.50] us
[3273.50 → 3273.72] all
[3273.72 → 3273.86] of
[3273.86 → 3274.36] humanity
[3274.36 → 3274.74] what
[3274.74 → 3274.88] we
[3274.88 → 3275.12] call
[3275.12 → 3275.28] the
[3275.28 → 3275.68] cultural
[3275.68 → 3276.14] mandate
[3276.14 → 3277.24] in
[3277.24 → 3277.38] this
[3277.38 → 3277.76] cultural
[3277.76 → 3278.22] mandate
[3278.22 → 3278.68] God
[3278.68 → 3279.02] put
[3279.02 → 3279.28] Adam
[3279.28 → 3279.50] and Eve
[3279.50 → 3279.70] in the
[3279.70 → 3279.96] garden
[3279.96 → 3280.66] and he
[3280.66 → 3281.00] called
[3284.98 → 3285.02] to
[3285.02 → 3285.32] tend
[3285.32 → 3285.56] the
[3285.56 → 3285.82] garden
[3285.82 → 3286.02] to
[3286.02 → 3286.42] grow
[3286.42 → 3286.78] things
[3286.78 → 3286.94] to
[3286.94 → 3287.26] build
[3287.26 → 3287.80] things
[3287.80 → 3288.28] to
[3288.28 → 3288.82] cultivate
[3288.82 → 3289.48] creation
[3289.48 → 3290.00] to
[3290.00 → 3290.32] bring
[3290.32 → 3290.66] forth

[3316.86 → 3317.22] work
[3317.22 → 3317.38] in
[3317.38 → 3317.50] the
[3317.50 → 3317.88] world
[3317.88 → 3319.12] having
[3319.12 → 3319.88] something
[3319.88 → 3320.20] to
[3320.20 → 3320.58] do
[3320.58 → 3320.80] that
[3320.80 → 3321.00] is
[3321.00 → 3321.52] fulfilling
[3321.52 → 3321.84] that
[3321.84 → 3322.06] maybe
[3322.06 → 3322.70] provides
[3322.70 → 3323.42] for the
[3323.42 → 3323.74] needs
[3323.74 → 3323.98] of our
[3323.98 → 3324.30] family
[3324.30 → 3324.52] and
[3324.52 → 3325.02] friends
[3325.02 → 3325.84] that
[3325.84 → 3325.98] is
[3325.98 → 3326.10] a
[3326.10 → 3326.22] good
[3326.22 → 3326.52] thing

[3328.52 → 3329.62] so
[3329.62 → 3329.74] now
[3329.74 → 3329.86] the
[3329.86 → 3330.16] question
[3330.16 → 3330.40] is
[3330.40 → 3330.70] why
[3330.70 → 3330.92] do
[3330.92 → 3331.08] I
[3331.08 → 3331.50] often
[3331.50 → 3331.76] feel
[3331.76 → 3332.14] so
[3332.14 → 3333.18] frustrated
[3333.18 → 3333.78] with
[3333.78 → 3334.38] my
[3334.38 → 3334.64] work
[3334.64 → 3334.96] why
[3334.96 → 3335.26] is
[3335.26 → 3335.64] work
[3335.64 → 3336.28] so
[3336.28 → 3336.84] hard
[3336.84 → 3337.92] you
[3337.92 → 3338.02] know
[3338.02 → 3338.30] why
[3338.30 → 3338.54] does
[3338.54 → 3338.66] it
[3338.66 → 3338.84] feel
[3338.84 → 3339.00] like
[3339.00 → 3339.32] I
[3339.32 → 3339.66] have
[3339.66 → 3339.92] a
[3339.92 → 3340.46] project
[3340.46 → 3340.64] I
[3340.64 → 3340.78] want
[3340.78 → 3340.86] to
[3340.86 → 3340.98] do
[3340.98 → 3341.08] a
[3341.08 → 3341.24] home
[3344.98 → 3346.68] injury
[3346.68 → 3347.54] like
[3347.54 → 3348.22] why
[3348.22 → 3349.06] does
[3349.06 → 3349.24] this
[3349.24 → 3349.58] happen
[3349.58 → 3352.28] first
[3352.28 → 3352.54] the
[3352.54 → 3352.88] Bible
[3352.88 → 3353.78] teaches
[3353.78 → 3354.22] us
[3354.22 → 3354.66] that
[3354.66 → 3355.32] Adam
[3355.32 → 3355.50] and
[3355.50 → 3355.74] Eve
[3355.74 → 3356.34] rebelled
[3356.34 → 3356.68] against
[3356.68 → 3357.04] God
[3357.04 → 3358.06] and
[3358.06 → 3358.26] when
[3358.26 → 3358.46] they
[3358.46 → 3358.68] did
[3358.68 → 3358.82] that
[3358.82 → 3359.06] as
[3359.06 → 3359.16] a
[3359.16 → 3359.56] result
[3359.56 → 3359.78] we
[3359.78 → 3360.20] lost
[3360.20 → 3360.40] the
[3360.40 → 3360.86] blessing
[3360.86 → 3361.10] that
[3361.10 → 3361.32] God
[3361.32 → 3361.48] had
[3361.48 → 3361.78] placed
[3361.78 → 3361.94] on
[3361.94 → 3362.08] our
[3362.08 → 3362.38] work
[3362.38 → 3363.30] and
[3363.30 → 3363.42] so
[3363.42 → 3363.60] our
[3363.60 → 3363.86] work
[3363.86 → 3364.08] has
[3364.08 → 3364.24] been
[3364.24 → 3364.62] filled
[3364.62 → 3365.00] with
[3365.00 → 3365.76] toil
[3365.76 → 3366.32] and
[3366.32 → 3367.08] frustration
[3367.08 → 3367.70] ever
[3367.70 → 3368.16] since
[3368.16 → 3369.54] but
[3369.54 → 3369.82] then
[3369.82 → 3370.10] a
[3370.10 → 3370.34] little
[3370.34 → 3370.94] later
[3370.94 → 3371.44] on
[3371.44 → 3371.62] in
[3371.62 → 3371.74] the
[3371.74 → 3371.88] book
[3371.88 → 3372.04] of
[3372.04 → 3372.42] Genesis
[3372.42 → 3373.24] we
[3373.24 → 3373.58] read
[3373.58 → 3373.92] about
[3373.92 → 3374.20] the
[3374.20 → 3374.74] story
[3374.74 → 3375.12] of
[3375.12 → 3375.26] the
[3375.26 → 3375.58] Tower
[3375.58 → 3375.84] of
[3375.84 → 3376.20] Babel
[3376.20 → 3377.54] and
[3377.54 → 3377.72] that
[3377.72 → 3378.24] story
[3378.24 → 3378.70] gets
[3378.70 → 3378.84] at
[3378.84 → 3379.02] this
[3379.02 → 3379.28] point
[3379.28 → 3379.56] quite
[3379.56 → 3379.74] a
[3379.74 → 3380.00] bit
[3380.00 → 3381.24] because
[3381.24 → 3381.58] what
[3381.58 → 3381.74] it
[3381.74 → 3382.06] is
[3382.06 → 3382.20] we
[3382.20 → 3382.32] see
[3382.32 → 3382.44] the
[3382.44 → 3382.68] Tower
[3382.68 → 3382.80] of
[3382.80 → 3382.98] Babel
[3382.98 → 3383.12] all
[3383.12 → 3383.26] these
[3383.26 → 3383.52] people
[3383.52 → 3383.98] gathered
[3383.98 → 3384.44] together
[3384.44 → 3384.60] and
[3384.60 → 3384.74] it's
[3384.74 → 3384.90] like
[3384.90 → 3385.16] the
[3385.16 → 3385.58] first
[3385.58 → 3385.90] big
[3385.90 → 3386.30] public
[3386.30 → 3386.72] works
[3386.72 → 3387.56] project
[3387.56 → 3388.54] in
[3388.54 → 3388.78] human
[3388.78 → 3389.16] history
[3389.16 → 3390.50] and
[3390.50 → 3390.62] the
[3390.62 → 3390.98] people
[3390.98 → 3391.20] of
[3391.20 → 3391.68] Babel
[3391.68 → 3392.54] when
[3392.54 → 3392.66] they
[3392.66 → 3392.94] talk
[3392.94 → 3393.20] about
[3393.20 → 3393.68] why
[3393.68 → 3393.94] they're
[3393.94 → 3394.06] going
[3394.06 → 3394.16] to
[3394.16 → 3394.34] build
[3394.34 → 3394.54] that
[3394.54 → 3394.96] tower
[3394.96 → 3395.56] they
[3395.56 → 3395.94] say
[3395.94 → 3396.16] they're
[3396.16 → 3396.44] building
[3396.44 → 3396.64] a
[3396.64 → 3396.88] tower
[3396.88 → 3397.08] that
[3397.08 → 3397.22] will
[3397.22 → 3397.58] reach
[3397.58 → 3397.90] up
[3397.90 → 3398.08] to
[3398.08 → 3398.34] heaven
[3398.34 → 3398.78] why
[3398.78 → 3400.30] let
[3404.74 → 3405.10] make
[3405.10 → 3405.40] a
[3405.40 → 3405.76] name
[3405.76 → 3406.08] for
[3406.08 → 3406.72] ourselves
[3406.72 → 3408.04] and
[3408.04 → 3408.52] like
[3408.52 → 3409.08] them
[3409.08 → 3409.74] maybe
[3409.74 → 3410.02] not
[3410.02 → 3410.38] so
[3410.38 → 3411.40] arrogantly
[3411.40 → 3411.98] as
[3411.98 → 3412.30] that
[3412.30 → 3413.20] but
[3413.20 → 3413.58] we
[3413.58 → 3414.16] often
[3414.16 → 3414.40] are

[3451.00 → 3451.46] problem
[3451.46 → 3452.02] comes
[3452.02 → 3452.24] when
[3452.24 → 3452.42] we
[3452.42 → 3452.74] think
[3452.74 → 3452.94] that
[3452.94 → 3453.12] we
[3453.12 → 3453.32] can

[3453.58 → 3453.74] it
[3453.74 → 3453.98] in
[3453.98 → 3454.16] our
[3454.16 → 3454.40] own
[3454.40 → 3454.92] strength
[3454.92 → 3455.68] and
[3455.68 → 3456.00] do
[3456.00 → 3456.22] it
[3456.22 → 3456.70] apart
[3456.70 → 3457.16] from
[3457.16 → 3457.52] God
[3457.52 → 3458.84] that's
[3458.84 → 3458.94] the
[3458.94 → 3459.32] problem
[3459.32 → 3460.34] and
[3460.34 → 3460.48] so
[3460.48 → 3460.76] whether
[3460.76 → 3461.08] you're
[3461.08 → 3461.36] building
[3461.36 → 3461.66] a
[3461.66 → 3462.12] home
[3462.12 → 3462.36] or
[3462.36 → 3462.56] a
[3462.56 → 3462.94] family
[3462.94 → 3463.26] whether
[3463.26 → 3463.46] you're
[3463.46 → 3463.78] building
[3463.78 → 3464.26] a
[3464.26 → 3464.76] career
[3464.76 → 3465.08] or
[3465.08 → 3465.26] a
[3465.26 → 3465.64] company
[3465.64 → 3466.12] or
[3466.12 → 3466.40] whether
[3466.40 → 3466.60] we
[3466.60 → 3466.72] are
[3466.72 → 3467.10] building
[3467.10 → 3467.42] a
[3467.42 → 3467.74] church
[3467.74 → 3468.36] community
[3468.36 → 3469.44] our
[3469.44 → 3469.98] trouble
[3469.98 → 3470.48] comes
[3470.48 → 3470.72] when
[3470.72 → 3470.88] we
[3470.88 → 3471.34] forget
[3471.34 → 3471.70] Psalm
[3471.70 → 3472.26] 127
[3472.26 → 3473.42] that
[3473.42 → 3473.98] unless
[3473.98 → 3474.46] the
[3474.46 → 3475.00] Lord
[3475.00 → 3475.82] builds
[3475.82 → 3476.02] the
[3476.02 → 3476.48] house
[3476.48 → 3477.46] the
[3477.46 → 3477.88] workers
[3477.88 → 3478.42] labour
[3478.42 → 3479.10] in
[3479.10 → 3479.38] vain
[3479.38 → 3481.18] so
[3481.18 → 3481.32] I
[3481.32 → 3481.52] heard
[3481.52 → 3481.96] this
[3481.96 → 3482.74] antidote
[3482.74 → 3483.08] about
[3483.08 → 3483.50] Benjamin
[3483.50 → 3484.00] Franklin
[3484.00 → 3485.18] he
[3485.18 → 3485.40] gave
[3485.40 → 3485.60] a
[3485.60 → 3486.10] speech
[3486.10 → 3486.34] in
[3486.34 → 3486.84] Philadelphia
[3486.84 → 3488.14] in
[3488.14 → 3489.26] 1787
[3489.26 → 3490.02] and
[3490.02 → 3490.26] so
[3490.26 → 3490.48] there
[3490.48 → 3490.56] was
[3490.56 → 3490.66] a
[3490.66 → 3490.98] gathering
[3490.98 → 3491.12] there
[3491.12 → 3491.16] was
[3491.16 → 3491.28] a
[3491.28 → 3491.72] convention
[3491.72 → 3492.46] of
[3492.46 → 3494.86] where
[3494.86 → 3495.02] they
[3495.02 → 3495.10] were
[3495.10 → 3495.20] going
[3495.20 → 3495.26] to
[3495.26 → 3495.68] deliberate
[3495.68 → 3496.10] over
[3496.10 → 3496.76] creating
[3496.76 → 3497.16] the
[3497.16 → 3497.70] constitution
[3497.70 → 3497.98] of
[3497.98 → 3498.06] the
[3498.06 → 3498.26] United
[3498.26 → 3498.74] States
[3498.74 → 3499.56] so
[3499.56 → 3499.74] this
[3499.74 → 3499.88] is
[3499.88 → 3500.14] what
[3500.14 → 3500.54] Benjamin
[3500.54 → 3500.94] Franklin
[3500.94 → 3501.28] said
[3501.28 → 3501.44] in
[3501.44 → 3501.62] his
[3501.62 → 3501.98] speech
[3501.98 → 3502.16] and
[3502.16 → 3502.28] we'll
[3502.28 → 3502.42] just
[3502.42 → 3502.60] have
[3502.60 → 3502.72] the
[3502.72 → 3502.96] quote
[3502.96 → 3503.32] up
[3503.32 → 3503.52] here
[3503.52 → 3504.28] he
[3504.28 → 3504.52] says
[3504.52 → 3504.84] this
[3504.84 → 3505.10] so
[3505.10 → 3505.22] he's
[3505.22 → 3505.42] speaking
[3505.42 → 3505.58] to
[3505.58 → 3505.68] the
[3505.68 → 3506.06] convention
[3506.06 → 3506.56] is
[3506.56 → 3506.70] it
[3506.70 → 3507.18] possible
[3507.18 → 3507.76] that
[3507.76 → 3507.98] an
[3507.98 → 3508.46] empire
[3508.46 → 3508.72] can
[3508.72 → 3509.38] rise
[3509.38 → 3510.14] without
[3510.14 → 3510.62] God's
[3510.62 → 3510.90] aid
[3510.90 → 3512.24] we
[3512.24 → 3512.46] have
[3512.46 → 3512.64] been
[3512.64 → 3513.08] assured
[3513.08 → 3513.42] in
[3513.42 → 3513.54] the
[3513.54 → 3513.82] sacred
[3513.82 → 3514.40] writings
[3514.40 → 3515.08] that
[3515.08 → 3516.32] Psalm 127
[3516.32 → 3516.94] verse 1
[3516.94 → 3517.78] except the
[3517.78 → 3518.30] Lord build
[3518.30 → 3518.86] the house
[3518.86 → 3519.58] they labour
[3519.58 → 3520.14] in vain
[3520.14 → 3520.56] that build
[3520.56 → 3520.74] it
[3520.74 → 3521.82] I
[3521.82 → 3522.20] firmly
[3522.20 → 3522.58] believe
[3522.58 → 3522.80] this
[3522.80 → 3523.04] and I
[3523.04 → 3523.38] also
[3523.38 → 3523.74] believe
[3523.74 → 3523.92] that
[3523.92 → 3524.14] without
[3524.14 → 3524.58] his
[3524.58 → 3525.04] concurrent
[3525.04 → 3525.46] aid
[3525.46 → 3526.06] we
[3526.06 → 3526.26] shall
[3526.26 → 3526.72] proceed
[3526.72 → 3526.94] in
[3526.94 → 3527.16] this
[3527.16 → 3527.52] political
[3527.52 → 3527.92] building
[3527.92 → 3528.12] no
[3528.12 → 3528.50] better
[3528.50 → 3529.24] than
[3529.24 → 3529.42] the
[3529.42 → 3529.72] builders
[3529.72 → 3530.38] of
[3530.38 → 3530.74] Babel
[3530.74 → 3532.44] right
[3532.44 → 3532.62] so
[3532.62 → 3533.04] Benjamin
[3533.04 → 3533.46] Franklin
[3533.46 → 3534.16] understood
[3534.16 → 3534.90] and
[3534.90 → 3535.32] believed
[3535.32 → 3535.52] that
[3535.52 → 3536.04] what
[3536.04 → 3536.32] this
[3536.32 → 3536.60] psalm
[3536.60 → 3536.72] is
[3536.72 → 3536.98] telling
[3536.98 → 3537.18] us
[3537.18 → 3537.42] here
[3537.42 → 3538.24] which
[3538.24 → 3538.46] is
[3538.46 → 3538.66] that
[3538.66 → 3538.84] if
[3538.84 → 3539.02] the
[3539.02 → 3539.28] Lord
[3539.28 → 3539.84] doesn't
[3539.84 → 3540.10] build
[3540.10 → 3540.34] it
[3540.34 → 3541.24] it's
[3541.24 → 3541.50] not
[3541.50 → 3541.82] going to
[3541.82 → 3541.96] get
[3541.96 → 3542.34] built
[3542.34 → 3543.66] right
[3543.66 → 3544.06] if
[3544.06 → 3544.22] the
[3544.22 → 3544.48] Lord
[3544.48 → 3544.88] doesn't
[3544.88 → 3545.06] build
[3545.06 → 3545.24] the
[3545.24 → 3545.64] house
[3545.64 → 3546.38] if
[3546.38 → 3546.54] the
[3546.54 → 3546.72] Lord
[3546.72 → 3547.04] doesn't
[3547.04 → 3547.36] protect
[3547.36 → 3547.60] the
[3547.60 → 3547.90] city
[3547.90 → 3548.62] if
[3548.62 → 3548.78] the
[3548.78 → 3548.94] Lord
[3548.94 → 3549.24] doesn't
[3549.24 → 3549.64] provide
[3549.64 → 3549.86] the
[3549.86 → 3550.14] food
[3550.14 → 3550.48] if
[3550.48 → 3550.58] he
[3550.58 → 3550.90] doesn't
[3550.90 → 3551.22] open
[3551.22 → 3551.48] the
[3551.48 → 3551.78] womb
[3551.78 → 3552.48] all
[3552.48 → 3552.86] human
[3552.86 → 3553.32] effort
[3553.32 → 3554.16] is
[3554.16 → 3554.34] in
[3554.34 → 3554.60] vain
[3554.60 → 3555.64] and
[3555.64 → 3555.78] he
[3555.78 → 3556.02] uses
[3556.02 → 3556.32] this
[3556.32 → 3556.60] word
[3556.60 → 3557.20] vain
[3557.20 → 3558.00] to
[3558.00 → 3558.60] describe
[3558.60 → 3559.18] all
[3559.18 → 3559.84] existence
[3559.84 → 3560.42] all
[3560.42 → 3560.94] endeavours
[3560.94 → 3561.98] all
[3561.98 → 3562.88] pursuits
[3562.88 → 3564.44] that
[3564.44 → 3564.62] the
[3564.62 → 3564.82] Lord
[3564.82 → 3564.94] is
[3564.94 → 3565.12] not
[3565.12 → 3565.38] in
[3565.38 → 3566.02] it's
[3566.02 → 3566.44] vanity
[3566.44 → 3566.88] and
[3566.88 → 3567.20] it's
[3567.20 → 3567.32] a
[3567.32 → 3567.48] word
[3567.48 → 3567.62] that
[3567.62 → 3567.82] means
[3567.82 → 3568.02] it's
[3568.02 → 3568.66] futile
[3568.66 → 3569.20] it is
[3569.20 → 3569.66] meaningless
[3569.66 → 3570.32] it's
[3570.32 → 3570.56] not
[3570.56 → 3570.96] going
[3570.96 → 3571.22] to
[3571.22 → 3571.88] last
[3571.88 → 3574.46] in
[3574.46 → 3574.66] his
[3574.66 → 3575.04] wonderful
[3575.04 → 3575.38] book
[3575.38 → 3575.50] on
[3575.50 → 3575.62] the
[3575.62 → 3575.94] Psalms
[3575.94 → 3576.08] of
[3576.08 → 3576.56] Ascent
[3576.56 → 3577.66] Eugene
[3577.66 → 3578.10] Peterson
[3578.10 → 3578.46] says
[3578.46 → 3578.90] this
[3578.90 → 3581.22] our
[3581.22 → 3581.76] work
[3581.76 → 3582.78] creates
[3582.78 → 3583.24] neither
[3583.24 → 3583.76] life
[3583.76 → 3584.00] nor
[3584.00 → 3584.50] righteousness
[3584.50 → 3586.10] relentless
[3586.10 → 3586.94] compulsive
[3586.94 → 3587.28] work
[3587.28 → 3587.68] habits
[3587.68 → 3588.20] which
[3588.20 → 3588.34] our
[3588.34 → 3588.78] society
[3588.78 → 3589.36] rewards
[3589.36 → 3589.54] and
[3589.54 → 3590.08] admires
[3590.08 → 3590.66] are
[3590.66 → 3591.06] seen
[3591.06 → 3591.28] by
[3591.28 → 3591.50] the
[3591.50 → 3591.88] psalmist
[3591.88 → 3592.18] as
[3592.18 → 3592.36] a
[3592.36 → 3592.82] sign
[3592.82 → 3593.38] of
[3593.38 → 3593.62] weak
[3593.62 → 3594.08] faith
[3594.08 → 3595.30] in
[3595.30 → 3595.86] assertive
[3595.86 → 3596.36] pride
[3596.36 → 3597.26] as if
[3597.26 → 3597.54] God
[3597.54 → 3597.98] could not
[3597.98 → 3598.18] be
[3598.18 → 3598.52] trusted
[3598.52 → 3598.74] to
[3598.74 → 3599.16] accomplish
[3599.16 → 3599.48] his
[3599.48 → 3599.78] will
[3599.78 → 3600.66] as if
[3600.66 → 3601.80] we
[3601.80 → 3602.76] could
[3602.76 → 3603.18] arrange
[3603.18 → 3603.42] the
[3603.42 → 3603.94] universe
[3603.94 → 3604.76] by
[3604.76 → 3605.36] our
[3605.36 → 3605.78] own
[3605.78 → 3606.20] effort
[3606.20 → 3608.12] and
[3608.12 → 3608.28] so
[3608.28 → 3608.50] you
[3608.50 → 3608.68] see
[3608.68 → 3608.88] this
[3608.88 → 3609.24] problem
[3609.24 → 3609.58] is
[3609.58 → 3609.80] we
[3609.80 → 3610.24] work
[3610.24 → 3610.74] often
[3610.74 → 3611.32] in
[3611.32 → 3611.46] our
[3611.46 → 3611.72] modern
[3611.72 → 3612.24] society
[3612.24 → 3612.60] too
[3612.60 → 3613.16] hard
[3613.16 → 3613.92] we're
[3613.92 → 3614.20] often
[3614.20 → 3614.46] so
[3614.46 → 3615.18] frustrated
[3615.18 → 3615.54] with
[3615.54 → 3615.70] our
[3615.70 → 3615.96] work
[3615.96 → 3616.12] we're
[3616.12 → 3616.36] often
[3616.36 → 3616.62] so
[3616.62 → 3617.34] exhausted
[3617.34 → 3619.08] ultimately
[3619.08 → 3619.62] because
[3619.62 → 3620.38] we
[3620.38 → 3620.84] don't
[3620.84 → 3621.44] trust
[3621.44 → 3621.66] that
[3621.66 → 3621.94] God
[3621.94 → 3622.12] is
[3622.12 → 3622.46] working
[3622.46 → 3623.66] and
[3623.66 → 3623.80] that
[3623.80 → 3624.08] means
[3624.08 → 3624.44] friends
[3624.44 → 3624.68] that
[3624.68 → 3625.02] only
[3625.02 → 3625.32] when
[3625.32 → 3625.50] we
[3625.50 → 3625.86] trust
[3625.86 → 3626.46] God
[3626.46 → 3627.20] can
[3627.20 → 3627.44] we
[3627.44 → 3627.76] then
[3627.76 → 3628.26] work
[3628.26 → 3629.38] with
[3629.38 → 3629.88] restful
[3629.88 → 3630.34] hearts
[3630.34 → 3633.28] and
[3633.28 → 3633.80] verse
[3633.80 → 3634.22] two
[3634.22 → 3634.66] in this
[3634.66 → 3634.88] psalm
[3634.88 → 3635.06] says
[3635.06 → 3635.34] something
[3635.34 → 3636.08] that
[3636.08 → 3636.22] I
[3636.22 → 3636.38] think
[3636.38 → 3636.54] is
[3636.54 → 3636.88] such
[3636.88 → 3638.08] you
[3638.08 → 3638.16] know
[3638.16 → 3638.30] it's
[3638.30 → 3638.38] a
[3638.38 → 3638.54] great
[3638.54 → 3638.92] verse
[3638.92 → 3640.58] it's
[3640.58 → 3640.88] always
[3640.88 → 3641.22] good
[3641.22 → 3641.42] to
[3641.42 → 3641.98] have
[3641.98 → 3642.34] someone
[3642.34 → 3642.78] ask
[3642.78 → 3643.12] you
[3643.12 → 3644.04] how
[3644.04 → 3644.36] are
[3644.36 → 3644.58] you
[3644.58 → 3645.04] sleeping
[3645.04 → 3646.00] how
[3646.00 → 3646.16] are
[3646.16 → 3646.28] you
[3646.28 → 3646.60] sleeping
[3646.60 → 3647.80] so
[3647.80 → 3648.06] verse
[3648.06 → 3648.24] two
[3648.24 → 3648.54] says
[3648.54 → 3648.84] in
[3648.84 → 3649.30] vain
[3649.30 → 3649.52] you
[3649.52 → 3649.78] rise
[3649.78 → 3650.10] early
[3650.10 → 3650.30] and
[3650.30 → 3650.52] stay
[3650.52 → 3650.70] up
[3650.70 → 3651.02] late
[3651.02 → 3651.48] toiling
[3651.48 → 3651.70] for
[3651.70 → 3651.92] food
[3651.92 → 3652.06] to
[3652.06 → 3652.32] eat
[3652.32 → 3652.86] for
[3652.86 → 3653.02] he

[3653.32 → 3653.62] sleep
[3653.62 → 3653.78] to
[3653.78 → 3654.00] those
[3654.00 → 3654.14] he
[3654.14 → 3654.52] loves
[3654.52 → 3656.42] right
[3656.42 → 3656.78] and
[3656.78 → 3657.14] haven't
[3657.14 → 3657.28] we
[3657.28 → 3657.46] all
[3657.46 → 3657.78] had
[3657.78 → 3658.04] those
[3658.04 → 3658.50] nights
[3658.50 → 3659.30] when
[3659.30 → 3659.38] it
[3659.38 → 3659.50] was
[3659.50 → 3659.78] very
[3659.78 → 3660.16] hard
[3660.16 → 3660.40] to
[3660.40 → 3660.80] sleep
[3660.80 → 3661.52] because
[3661.52 → 3661.72] we
[3661.72 → 3661.84] were
[3661.84 → 3662.20] so
[3662.20 → 3662.66] anxious
[3662.66 → 3663.04] about
[3663.04 → 3663.32] all
[3663.32 → 3663.56] this
[3663.56 → 3663.90] stuff
[3663.90 → 3664.04] that
[3664.04 → 3664.16] we
[3664.16 → 3664.38] have
[3664.38 → 3664.50] to
[3664.50 → 3664.80] do
[3664.80 → 3665.84] I
[3665.84 → 3665.94] have
[3665.94 → 3666.02] to
[3666.02 → 3666.16] be
[3666.16 → 3666.48] honest
[3666.48 → 3666.70] with
[3666.70 → 3666.82] you
[3666.82 → 3666.96] I
[3666.96 → 3667.08] have
[3667.08 → 3667.20] a
[3667.20 → 3667.60] recurring
[3667.60 → 3668.08] nightmare
[3668.08 → 3669.92] probably
[3669.92 → 3670.20] every
[3670.20 → 3670.56] couple
[3670.56 → 3671.06] months
[3671.06 → 3671.72] I'm
[3671.72 → 3672.06] standing
[3672.06 → 3672.30] up
[3672.30 → 3672.66] here
[3672.66 → 3674.56] and
[3674.56 → 3674.86] I
[3674.86 → 3675.60] forgot
[3675.60 → 3675.90] to
[3675.90 → 3676.28] prepare
[3676.28 → 3677.34] I
[3677.34 → 3677.58] have
[3677.58 → 3678.18] no
[3678.18 → 3678.68] notes
[3678.68 → 3679.58] right
[3679.58 → 3679.76] and
[3679.76 → 3679.96] it's
[3679.96 → 3680.16] this
[3680.16 → 3681.02] terrible
[3681.02 → 3681.70] nightmare
[3681.70 → 3682.10] because
[3682.10 → 3682.34] you know
[3682.34 → 3683.14] it's
[3683.14 → 3683.48] usually on
[3683.48 → 3683.74] Saturday
[3683.74 → 3684.20] nights
[3684.52 → 3685.30] you
[3685.30 → 3685.42] know
[3685.42 → 3685.60] and
[3685.60 → 3685.98] I'm
[3685.98 → 3686.36] anxious
[3686.36 → 3687.14] about
[3687.14 → 3687.82] this
[3687.82 → 3688.28] work
[3688.28 → 3688.56] right
[3688.56 → 3688.72] that
[3688.72 → 3688.82] we
[3688.82 → 3688.98] have
[3688.98 → 3689.08] to
[3689.08 → 3689.20] do
[3689.20 → 3689.28] and
[3689.28 → 3689.36] I
[3689.36 → 3689.44] don't
[3689.44 → 3689.50] want
[3689.50 → 3689.58] to
[3689.58 → 3689.70] come
[3689.70 → 3689.96] across
[3689.96 → 3690.12] as
[3690.12 → 3691.02] unprofessional
[3691.02 → 3691.40] or
[3691.40 → 3692.00] unprepared
[3692.00 → 3692.30] right
[3692.30 → 3693.98] and
[3693.98 → 3694.24] so
[3694.24 → 3694.70] you
[3694.70 → 3694.80] know
[3694.80 → 3695.06] there's
[3695.06 → 3695.28] this
[3695.28 → 3695.96] anxious
[3695.96 → 3696.62] sleep
[3696.62 → 3697.54] that
[3697.54 → 3698.12] and
[3698.12 → 3698.30] this
[3698.30 → 3698.64] is
[3698.64 → 3698.82] my
[3698.82 → 3699.26] example
[3699.26 → 3699.62] and
[3699.62 → 3699.72] you
[3699.72 → 3699.82] know
[3699.82 → 3699.94] and
[3699.94 → 3700.12] maybe
[3700.12 → 3700.34] you've
[3700.34 → 3700.46] all
[3700.46 → 3700.72] had
[3700.72 → 3701.18] examples
[3701.18 → 3701.74] similar
[3701.74 → 3701.92] to
[3701.92 → 3702.16] that
[3702.16 → 3703.38] you
[3703.38 → 3703.46] know
[3703.46 → 3703.60] of
[3703.60 → 3703.76] course
[3703.76 → 3703.90] there
[3703.90 → 3704.02] are
[3704.02 → 3704.18] those
[3704.18 → 3704.58] emergency
[3704.58 → 3705.30] situations
[3705.30 → 3705.58] when
[3705.58 → 3705.70] we
[3705.70 → 3705.90] have
[3705.90 → 3706.24] to
[3706.24 → 3706.84] lose
[3706.84 → 3707.16] sleep
[3707.16 → 3707.30] in
[3707.30 → 3707.46] order
[3707.46 → 3707.72] to
[3707.72 → 3707.98] take
[3707.98 → 3708.16] care
[3708.16 → 3708.28] of
[3708.28 → 3708.50] something
[3708.50 → 3708.94] important
[3708.94 → 3709.96] but
[3709.96 → 3710.16] if
[3710.16 → 3710.32] that
[3710.32 → 3710.64] becomes
[3710.64 → 3710.82] a
[3710.82 → 3711.08] regular
[3711.08 → 3711.62] pattern
[3711.62 → 3711.92] of
[3711.92 → 3712.42] life
[3712.42 → 3712.66] this
[3712.66 → 3713.10] anxious
[3713.10 → 3713.90] sleep
[3713.90 → 3714.90] it
[3714.90 → 3715.10] maybe
[3715.10 → 3715.62] reflects
[3715.62 → 3716.00] that
[3716.00 → 3716.12] we're
[3716.12 → 3716.34] not
[3716.34 → 3716.74] trusting
[3716.74 → 3716.98] in
[3716.98 → 3717.30] God
[3717.30 → 3718.02] to
[3718.02 → 3718.18] be
[3718.18 → 3718.42] honest
[3718.42 → 3718.60] I
[3718.60 → 3718.78] think
[3718.78 → 3719.50] that's
[3719.50 → 3719.82] what
[3719.82 → 3720.28] it's
[3720.28 → 3720.52] telling
[3720.52 → 3720.80] me
[3720.80 → 3720.94] and
[3720.94 → 3721.04] I
[3721.04 → 3721.18] need
[3721.18 → 3721.32] to
[3721.32 → 3721.52] listen
[3721.52 → 3721.72] to
[3721.72 → 3723.94] so
[3723.94 → 3724.10] when
[3724.10 → 3724.22] we
[3724.22 → 3724.40] go
[3724.40 → 3724.58] to
[3724.58 → 3724.78] sleep
[3724.78 → 3724.94] at
[3724.94 → 3725.30] night
[3725.30 → 3725.68] we're
[3725.68 → 3726.06] essentially
[3726.06 → 3726.54] saying
[3726.54 → 3726.74] you know
[3726.74 → 3727.06] God
[3727.06 → 3727.44] I
[3727.44 → 3727.86] believe
[3727.86 → 3728.12] that
[3728.12 → 3728.44] you
[3728.44 → 3728.72] are
[3728.72 → 3729.10] God
[3729.10 → 3730.16] and
[3730.16 → 3730.40] that
[3730.40 → 3730.92] you
[3730.92 → 3731.12] run
[3731.12 → 3731.28] the
[3731.28 → 3731.66] universe
[3731.66 → 3731.98] not
[3731.98 → 3732.26] me
[3732.26 → 3733.38] that
[3733.38 → 3733.60] you
[3733.60 → 3733.76] are
[3733.76 → 3733.94] in
[3733.94 → 3734.24] charge
[3734.24 → 3734.54] even
[3734.54 → 3734.70] of
[3734.70 → 3734.94] my
[3734.94 → 3735.16] little
[3735.16 → 3735.50] part
[3735.50 → 3735.66] of
[3735.66 → 3735.88] it
[3735.88 → 3737.28] and
[3737.28 → 3737.46] that
[3737.46 → 3737.62] you
[3737.62 → 3737.76] can
[3737.76 → 3737.90] do
[3737.90 → 3738.00] it
[3738.00 → 3738.20] without
[3738.20 → 3738.52] me
[3738.52 → 3739.18] and
[3739.18 → 3739.32] so
[3739.32 → 3739.56] I
[3739.56 → 3739.76] can
[3739.76 → 3740.14] sleep
[3740.14 → 3740.46] because
[3740.46 → 3740.82] I
[3740.82 → 3741.00] can
[3741.00 → 3741.32] trust
[3741.32 → 3741.54] that
[3741.54 → 3741.76] you
[3741.76 → 3742.02] have
[3742.02 → 3742.26] got
[3742.26 → 3742.68] this
[3742.68 → 3743.80] so
[3743.80 → 3743.92] I'm
[3743.92 → 3744.06] going
[3744.06 → 3744.18] to
[3744.18 → 3744.38] bed
[3744.38 → 3745.64] that's
[3745.64 → 3745.74] what
[3745.74 → 3745.84] it
[3745.84 → 3746.18] means
[3746.18 → 3747.34] you
[3747.34 → 3747.46] know
[3747.46 → 3747.70] there's
[3747.70 → 3747.82] this
[3747.82 → 3747.98] very
[3747.98 → 3748.36] famous
[3748.36 → 3748.86] story
[3748.86 → 3749.48] in
[3749.48 → 3749.64] the
[3749.64 → 3750.08] Roman
[3750.08 → 3750.50] Catholic
[3750.50 → 3750.86] Church
[3750.86 → 3751.06] and
[3751.06 → 3751.20] this
[3751.20 → 3751.50] happened
[3751.50 → 3751.82] during
[3751.82 → 3752.00] the

[3753.10 → 3753.54] and
[3753.54 → 3753.72] we've
[3753.72 → 3753.80] got
[3753.80 → 3753.90] to
[3753.90 → 3754.20] remember
[3754.20 → 3754.40] that
[3754.40 → 3754.52] the
[3754.52 → 3754.74] Second
[3754.74 → 3755.04] Vatican
[3755.04 → 3755.44] Council
[3755.44 → 3755.66] is

[3768.32 → 3768.82] conference
[3768.82 → 3769.54] you
[3769.54 → 3769.68] know
[3769.68 → 3770.20] weighty
[3770.20 → 3770.54] matters
[3770.54 → 3770.88] huge
[3770.88 → 3771.16] deal
[3771.16 → 3772.20] someone
[3772.20 → 3772.46] asked
[3772.46 → 3772.54] him
[3772.54 → 3772.80] how
[3772.80 → 3772.96] do
[3772.96 → 3773.08] you
[3773.08 → 3773.30] deal
[3773.30 → 3773.46] with
[3773.46 → 3773.62] the
[3773.62 → 3774.18] stress
[3774.18 → 3774.36] of
[3774.36 → 3774.50] all
[3774.50 → 3774.76] that
[3774.76 → 3775.64] and
[3775.64 → 3775.84] he
[3775.84 → 3776.26] said
[3776.26 → 3777.36] well
[3777.36 → 3777.64] at
[3777.64 → 3777.94] night
[3777.94 → 3778.14] I
[3778.14 → 3778.40] say
[3778.40 → 3778.58] to
[3778.58 → 3778.74] the
[3778.74 → 3779.06] Lord
[3779.06 → 3779.96] Lord
[3779.96 → 3780.22] it's
[3780.22 → 3780.42] your
[3780.42 → 3780.88] church
[3780.88 → 3781.54] I'm
[3781.54 → 3781.68] going
[3781.68 → 3781.82] to
[3781.82 → 3782.00] bed
[3782.00 → 3784.12] and
[3784.12 → 3784.24] I
[3784.24 → 3784.40] think
[3784.40 → 3784.62] that
[3784.62 → 3784.80] is
[3784.80 → 3785.10] a good
[3785.10 → 3785.42] lesson
[3785.42 → 3785.80] for
[3785.80 → 3785.96] all
[3785.96 → 3786.10] of
[3786.10 → 3786.40] us
[3786.40 → 3787.22] because
[3787.22 → 3787.70] God
[3787.70 → 3788.00] is
[3788.00 → 3788.48] working
[3788.48 → 3789.66] we
[3789.66 → 3789.90] can
[3789.90 → 3790.38] work
[3790.38 → 3791.12] with
[3791.12 → 3791.56] restful
[3791.56 → 3792.00] hearts
[3792.00 → 3794.58] and
[3794.58 → 3795.08] friends
[3795.08 → 3795.22] I
[3795.22 → 3795.36] think
[3795.36 → 3795.54] this
[3795.54 → 3795.68] is
[3795.68 → 3796.14] incredibly
[3796.14 → 3796.94] consoling
[3796.94 → 3797.56] because
[3797.56 → 3797.76] it
[3797.76 → 3797.94] means
[3797.94 → 3798.06] that
[3798.06 → 3798.20] no
[3798.20 → 3798.42] matter
[3798.42 → 3798.90] what
[3798.90 → 3799.42] I'm
[3799.42 → 3799.78] doing
[3799.78 → 3800.48] right
[3800.48 → 3800.80] whether
[3800.80 → 3801.36] I
[3801.36 → 3801.60] feel
[3801.60 → 3801.76] like
[3801.76 → 3801.92] I
[3801.92 → 3802.06] am
[3802.06 → 3802.74] succeeding
[3802.74 → 3803.76] or
[3803.76 → 3804.32] struggling
[3804.32 → 3804.58] in
[3804.58 → 3804.70] my
[3804.70 → 3805.02] work
[3805.02 → 3805.66] whether
[3805.66 → 3806.02] I
[3806.02 → 3806.44] know
[3806.44 → 3807.18] what
[3807.18 → 3807.34] I'm
[3807.34 → 3807.60] doing
[3807.60 → 3807.82] or
[3807.82 → 3808.04] whether
[3808.04 → 3808.28] I
[3808.28 → 3808.56] feel
[3808.56 → 3808.90] kind
[3808.90 → 3809.08] of
[3809.08 → 3810.04] clueless
[3810.04 → 3810.28] and
[3810.28 → 3810.44] just
[3810.44 → 3811.04] make
[3811.04 → 3811.30] stuff
[3811.30 → 3811.48] up
[3811.48 → 3811.64] as
[3811.64 → 3811.74] I
[3811.74 → 3811.88] go
[3811.88 → 3812.24] along
[3812.24 → 3813.44] whatever
[3813.44 → 3813.72] it
[3813.72 → 3813.92] is
[3813.92 → 3814.08] we
[3814.08 → 3814.38] know
[3814.38 → 3814.80] that God
[3814.80 → 3814.98] is
[3814.98 → 3815.14] at
[3815.14 → 3815.48] work
[3815.48 → 3816.24] and
[3816.24 → 3816.56] so
[3816.56 → 3816.76] he
[3816.76 → 3816.92] is
[3816.92 → 3817.28] coming
[3817.28 → 3818.06] to
[3818.06 → 3818.34] me
[3818.34 → 3818.94] and
[3818.94 → 3819.12] he
[3819.12 → 3819.28] is
[3819.28 → 3819.54] seeking
[3819.54 → 3819.92] to
[3819.92 → 3820.30] bring
[3820.30 → 3820.80] life
[3820.80 → 3821.30] in
[3821.30 → 3821.60] and
[3821.60 → 3821.94] through
[3821.94 → 3822.38] my
[3822.38 → 3822.84] life
[3822.84 → 3824.24] okay
[3824.24 → 3824.34] so
[3824.34 → 3824.52] we
[3824.52 → 3824.68] can
[3824.68 → 3825.14] work
[3825.14 → 3826.16] with
[3826.16 → 3826.50] restless
[3826.50 → 3826.84] heart
[3826.84 → 3827.76] with
[3827.76 → 3828.62] restful
[3828.62 → 3828.80] not
[3828.80 → 3829.10] restless
[3829.10 → 3829.54] we
[3829.54 → 3829.70] can
[3829.70 → 3829.94] work
[3829.94 → 3830.14] with
[3830.14 → 3830.66] restful
[3830.66 → 3831.08] hearts
[3831.08 → 3831.98] because
[3831.98 → 3832.20] we're
[3832.20 → 3832.60] trusting
[3832.60 → 3832.76] in
[3832.76 → 3832.88] what
[3832.88 → 3833.12] God
[3833.12 → 3833.26] is
[3833.26 → 3833.52] doing
[3833.52 → 3833.76] we're
[3833.76 → 3834.06] trusting
[3834.06 → 3834.30] what
[3834.30 → 3834.52] God
[3834.52 → 3834.66] is
[3834.66 → 3835.00] building
[3835.00 → 3835.72] okay
[3835.72 → 3835.82] and
[3835.82 → 3835.94] that
[3835.94 → 3836.16] brings
[3836.16 → 3836.28] us
[3836.28 → 3836.38] to
[3836.38 → 3836.52] the
[3836.52 → 3836.72] second
[3836.72 → 3837.02] point
[3837.02 → 3837.16] in
[3837.16 → 3837.30] this
[3837.30 → 3837.60] psalm
[3837.60 → 3838.88] to
[3838.88 → 3839.30] build
[3839.30 → 3839.50] what
[3839.50 → 3839.70] God
[3839.70 → 3839.86] is
[3839.86 → 3840.18] building
[3840.18 → 3840.46] that
[3840.46 → 3840.64] we
[3840.64 → 3840.78] can
[3840.78 → 3841.14] work
[3841.14 → 3841.40] with
[3841.40 → 3842.62] restful
[3842.62 → 3842.80] we
[3842.80 → 3843.10] work
[3843.10 → 3843.44] hard
[3843.44 → 3843.86] with
[3843.86 → 3844.38] restful
[3844.38 → 3844.86] hearts
[3844.86 → 3845.56] to
[3845.56 → 3845.90] build
[3845.90 → 3846.08] what
[3846.08 → 3846.32] God
[3846.32 → 3846.48] is
[3846.48 → 3846.82] building
[3846.82 → 3848.98] and
[3848.98 → 3849.10] we
[3849.10 → 3849.30] see
[3849.30 → 3849.60] this
[3849.60 → 3849.86] in
[3849.86 → 3850.10] verses
[3850.10 → 3850.40] 3
[3850.40 → 3850.54] to
[3850.54 → 3850.96] 5
[3850.96 → 3851.68] okay
[3851.68 → 3852.80] this
[3852.80 → 3853.20] psalm
[3853.20 → 3853.36] is
[3853.36 → 3853.62] a bit
[3853.62 → 3854.10] puzzling
[3854.10 → 3854.78] because
[3854.78 → 3855.58] often
[3855.58 → 3855.98] you read
[3855.98 → 3856.16] Psalm
[3856.16 → 3856.52] 127
[3856.52 → 3857.18] and
[3857.18 → 3857.58] people
[3857.58 → 3857.74] are
[3857.74 → 3857.96] like
[3857.96 → 3858.52] what
[3858.52 → 3858.76] on
[3858.76 → 3859.20] earth
[3859.20 → 3859.60] does
[3859.60 → 3859.76] the
[3859.76 → 3860.02] second
[3860.02 → 3860.34] half
[3864.06 → 3864.28] about
[3864.28 → 3864.82] God
[3864.82 → 3865.24] building
[3865.24 → 3866.12] and
[3866.12 → 3866.32] the
[3866.32 → 3866.96] watchmen
[3866.96 → 3867.44] and
[3867.44 → 3868.04] sleep
[3868.04 → 3868.78] and
[3868.78 → 3868.98] then
[3868.98 → 3869.16] all
[3869.16 → 3869.30] of a
[3869.30 → 3869.46] sudden
[3869.46 → 3869.60] in
[3869.60 → 3869.68] the
[3869.68 → 3869.90] second
[3869.90 → 3870.16] half
[3870.16 → 3870.32] the
[3870.32 → 3870.46] psalm
[3870.46 → 3870.74] starts
[3870.74 → 3871.06] talking
[3871.06 → 3871.36] about
[3871.36 → 3871.88] children
[3871.88 → 3872.90] so
[3872.90 → 3873.30] let's
[3873.30 → 3873.42] just
[3873.42 → 3873.68] read it
[3873.68 → 3873.94] again
[3873.94 → 3874.26] here
[3874.26 → 3874.58] verses
[3874.58 → 3874.84] 3
[3874.84 → 3874.96] to
[3874.96 → 3875.30] 5
[3875.30 → 3890.36] now
[3890.36 → 3890.50] this
[3890.50 → 3890.64] is
[3890.64 → 3891.16] a
[3891.16 → 3891.50] passage
[3891.50 → 3891.68] you
[3891.68 → 3891.82] might
[3891.82 → 3892.10] hear
[3892.10 → 3892.34] on
[3892.34 → 3893.08] Mother's
[3893.08 → 3893.18] or
[3893.18 → 3893.56] Father's
[3893.56 → 3893.80] Day
[3893.80 → 3894.38] Sunday
[3894.38 → 3895.74] something
[3895.74 → 3896.00] like
[3896.00 → 3896.20] that
[3896.20 → 3896.32] and
[3896.32 → 3896.46] I
[3896.46 → 3896.68] always
[3896.68 → 3896.96] read
[3896.96 → 3897.10] and
[3897.10 → 3897.20] I
[3897.20 → 3897.36] always
[3897.36 → 3897.56] thought
[3897.56 → 3897.70] it
[3897.70 → 3898.02] meant
[3898.02 → 3898.26] you
[3898.26 → 3898.38] know
[3898.38 → 3898.62] that
[3898.62 → 3899.54] the
[3899.54 → 3899.86] blessings
[3899.86 → 3900.06] of
[3900.06 → 3900.30] having
[3900.30 → 3900.62] children
[3900.62 → 3901.98] and
[3901.98 → 3902.20] yes
[3902.20 → 3902.38] that
[3902.38 → 3902.50] is
[3902.50 → 3902.78] true
[3902.78 → 3903.94] children
[3903.94 → 3904.16] are
[3904.16 → 3904.28] a
[3904.28 → 3904.56] blessing
[3904.56 → 3905.14] I
[3905.14 → 3905.38] think
[3905.38 → 3905.56] for
[3905.56 → 3906.06] parents
[3906.06 → 3906.40] now
[3906.40 → 3906.80] in
[3906.80 → 3907.22] summer
[3907.22 → 3907.70] months
[3907.70 → 3907.84] and
[3907.84 → 3908.00] maybe
[3908.00 → 3908.18] even
[3908.18 → 3908.32] during
[3908.32 → 3908.46] the
[3908.46 → 3908.82] pandemic
[3908.82 → 3909.10] we
[3909.10 → 3909.30] need
[3909.30 → 3909.40] to
[3909.40 → 3909.52] be
[3909.52 → 3909.82] reminded
[3909.82 → 3910.02] of
[3910.02 → 3910.24] that
[3910.24 → 3911.18] that
[3911.18 → 3911.38] children
[3911.38 → 3911.70] are
[3911.70 → 3911.92] a
[3911.92 → 3912.18] blessing
[3912.18 → 3912.52] in
[3912.52 → 3912.78] fact
[3912.78 → 3914.24] but
[3914.24 → 3914.42] when
[3914.42 → 3914.58] we
[3914.58 → 3914.88] read
[3914.88 → 3915.14] these
[3915.14 → 3915.52] verses
[3915.52 → 3916.18] in
[3916.18 → 3916.74] context
[3916.74 → 3916.92] of
[3916.92 → 3917.04] what
[3917.04 → 3917.40] comes
[3917.40 → 3918.12] before
[3918.12 → 3920.32] assuming
[3920.32 → 3921.04] and
[3921.04 → 3921.50] trusting
[3923.80 → 3924.02] he
[3924.02 → 3924.12] was
[3924.12 → 3924.40] making
[3924.40 → 3924.70] throughout
[3924.70 → 3924.92] the
[3924.92 → 3925.34] psalm
[3925.34 → 3926.14] we
[3926.14 → 3926.60] see
[3926.60 → 3926.80] that
[3926.80 → 3927.06] he's
[3927.06 → 3927.40] talking
[3927.40 → 3927.70] about
[3927.70 → 3927.86] our
[3927.86 → 3928.24] work
[3928.24 → 3929.64] and
[3929.64 → 3930.16] about
[3930.16 → 3930.46] how
[3930.46 → 3931.26] God's
[3931.26 → 3931.74] presence
[3931.74 → 3932.10] and
[3932.10 → 3932.76] involvement
[3932.76 → 3933.26] in
[3933.26 → 3933.42] our
[3933.42 → 3933.74] work
[3933.74 → 3934.20] that
[3934.20 → 3934.44] all
[3934.44 → 3934.54] of
[3934.54 → 3934.66] our
[3934.66 → 3934.92] work
[3934.92 → 3935.10] is
[3935.10 → 3935.26] for
[3935.26 → 3935.62] not
[3935.62 → 3936.96] and
[3936.96 → 3937.12] then
[3937.12 → 3937.48] he's
[3937.48 → 3937.76] like
[3937.76 → 3937.90] in
[3937.90 → 3938.10] verses
[3938.10 → 3938.42] 3
[3938.42 → 3938.58] and
[3938.58 → 3938.88] 5
[3938.88 → 3939.12] he's
[3939.12 → 3939.28] like
[3939.28 → 3939.44] well
[3939.44 → 3939.88] just
[3939.88 → 3940.06] think
[3940.06 → 3940.22] about
[3940.22 → 3940.68] children
[3940.68 → 3941.00] it's
[3941.00 → 3941.18] like
[3941.18 → 3941.44] that
[3941.44 → 3941.84] so
[3941.84 → 3941.98] it's
[3941.98 → 3942.08] an
[3942.08 → 3942.48] example
[3942.48 → 3943.18] of
[3943.18 → 3943.30] what
[3943.30 → 3943.46] he's
[3943.46 → 3943.60] already
[3943.60 → 3943.78] said
[3943.78 → 3944.12] before
[3944.12 → 3945.60] so
[3945.60 → 3945.78] what
[3945.78 → 3945.98] it's
[3945.98 → 3946.24] saying
[3946.24 → 3946.38] is
[3946.38 → 3946.54] that
[3946.54 → 3946.90] children
[3946.90 → 3947.26] are
[3947.26 → 3947.84] not
[3947.84 → 3948.64] so
[3948.64 → 3949.06] much
[3949.06 → 3949.26] the
[3949.26 → 3949.82] result
[3949.82 → 3950.14] of
[3950.14 → 3950.66] our
[3950.66 → 3951.28] work
[3951.28 → 3952.06] as
[3952.06 → 3952.22] they
[3952.22 → 3952.62] are
[3952.62 → 3953.02] the
[3953.02 → 3953.40] result
[3953.40 → 3953.62] of
[3953.62 → 3954.08] God
[3954.08 → 3955.12] working
[3955.12 → 3955.96] through
[3955.96 → 3956.34] us
[3956.34 → 3957.56] so
[3957.56 → 3957.72] the
[3957.72 → 3957.98] point
[3957.98 → 3958.16] the
[3958.16 → 3958.42] psalmist
[3958.42 → 3958.58] is
[3958.58 → 3958.86] making
[3958.86 → 3959.08] is
[3959.08 → 3959.34] that
[3959.34 → 3959.70] children
[3959.70 → 3960.18] are
[3960.18 → 3960.82] a
[3960.82 → 3961.22] gift
[3961.22 → 3962.44] that
[3962.44 → 3962.62] is
[3962.62 → 3962.76] to
[3962.76 → 3963.06] say
[3963.06 → 3963.62] children
[3963.62 → 3963.96] are
[3963.96 → 3964.36] born
[3964.36 → 3964.78] not
[3964.78 → 3965.32] through
[3965.32 → 3966.08] human
[3966.08 → 3966.44] work
[3966.44 → 3966.60] and
[3966.60 → 3967.00] effort
[3967.00 → 3967.52] but
[3967.52 → 3967.82] through
[3967.82 → 3968.08] this
[3968.08 → 3968.62] miraculous
[3968.62 → 3969.30] process
[3969.30 → 3969.56] of
[3969.56 → 3970.14] reproduction
[3970.14 → 3970.74] which
[3970.74 → 3971.06] God
[3971.06 → 3971.34] has
[3971.34 → 3971.90] created
[3971.90 → 3972.22] and
[3972.22 → 3972.36] that
[3972.36 → 3972.64] God
[3972.64 → 3973.16] does
[3973.16 → 3973.86] God
[3973.86 → 3974.02] is
[3974.02 → 3974.26] doing
[3974.26 → 3974.50] it
[3974.50 → 3975.62] okay
[3975.62 → 3975.82] so
[3975.82 → 3976.16] you
[3976.16 → 3976.26] know
[3976.26 → 3976.56] think
[3976.56 → 3976.84] about
[3976.84 → 3977.04] this
[3977.04 → 3977.30] for a
[3977.30 → 3977.62] moment
[3977.62 → 3978.34] what
[3978.34 → 3978.60] do
[3978.60 → 3978.98] we
[3978.98 → 3979.32] do
[3979.32 → 3979.54] to
[3979.54 → 3979.70] get
[3979.70 → 3980.08] children
[3980.08 → 3981.68] what
[3981.68 → 3981.82] do
[3981.82 → 3982.00] we
[3982.00 → 3982.22] do
[3982.22 → 3982.36] to
[3982.36 → 3982.50] get
[3982.50 → 3982.72] sons
[3982.72 → 3982.88] and
[3982.88 → 3983.18] daughters
[3983.18 → 3984.38] yes
[3984.38 → 3984.60] it
[3984.60 → 3985.10] requires
[3985.10 → 3985.36] our
[3985.36 → 3986.14] participation
[3986.14 → 3986.78] but
[3986.78 → 3987.22] hardly
[3987.22 → 3987.64] in the
[3987.64 → 3987.88] form
[3987.88 → 3988.04] of
[3988.04 → 3988.24] what
[3988.24 → 3988.40] we
[3988.40 → 3988.56] would
[3988.56 → 3988.86] call
[3988.86 → 3989.46] work
[3989.46 → 3990.64] right
[3990.64 → 3991.06] we
[3991.06 → 3991.36] did
[3991.36 → 3991.60] not
[3991.60 → 3992.30] make
[3992.30 → 3993.50] these
[3993.50 → 3993.96] amazing
[3993.96 → 3994.30] little
[3994.30 → 3994.88] creatures
[3994.88 → 3995.60] that
[3995.60 → 3996.14] walk
[3996.14 → 3996.70] and
[3996.70 → 3997.20] talk
[3997.20 → 3997.40] and
[3997.40 → 3997.78] grow
[3997.78 → 3998.32] up
[3998.32 → 3999.60] ourselves
[3999.60 → 4000.02] we
[4000.02 → 4000.26] didn't
[4000.26 → 4000.56] make
[4000.56 → 4000.80] all
[4000.80 → 4000.90] of
[4000.90 → 4001.02] that
[4001.02 → 4001.32] happen
[4001.32 → 4002.26] we
[4002.26 → 4002.46] are
[4002.46 → 4002.70] just
[4002.70 → 4003.64] participating
[4003.64 → 4005.00] in
[4005.00 → 4005.54] something
[4005.54 → 4005.84] that
[4005.84 → 4006.38] God
[4006.38 → 4006.74] is
[4006.74 → 4007.24] doing
[4007.24 → 4008.14] through
[4008.14 → 4008.72] us
[4008.72 → 4009.82] and
[4009.82 → 4010.10] that
[4010.10 → 4010.62] friends
[4010.62 → 4011.28] is a
[4011.28 → 4011.78] picture
[4011.78 → 4012.10] of
[4012.10 → 4012.64] all
[4012.64 → 4012.92] our
[4012.92 → 4013.24] work
[4013.24 → 4014.04] that
[4014.04 → 4014.18] is
[4014.18 → 4014.32] the
[4014.32 → 4014.64] point
[4014.64 → 4015.06] and
[4015.06 → 4015.14] so
[4015.14 → 4015.24] when
[4015.24 → 4015.34] it
[4015.34 → 4015.56] comes
[4015.56 → 4015.72] to
[4015.72 → 4016.16] children
[4016.16 → 4017.18] right
[4017.18 → 4017.40] they
[4017.40 → 4017.74] come
[4017.74 → 4018.00] from
[4018.00 → 4018.36] God
[4018.36 → 4018.74] we
[4018.74 → 4019.14] believe
[4019.14 → 4019.78] they
[4019.78 → 4020.18] grow
[4020.18 → 4020.58] up
[4020.58 → 4020.90] by
[4020.90 → 4021.48] God's
[4021.48 → 4021.92] grace
[4021.92 → 4022.48] and
[4022.48 → 4022.74] then
[4022.74 → 4023.12] we
[4023.12 → 4023.52] shoot
[4023.52 → 4023.68] them
[4023.68 → 4023.86] out
[4023.86 → 4024.06] like
[4024.06 → 4024.26] these
[4024.26 → 4024.72] arrows
[4024.72 → 4025.30] to
[4025.30 → 4025.56] land
[4025.56 → 4025.76] in
[4025.76 → 4026.18] places
[4026.18 → 4026.56] where
[4026.56 → 4026.80] that
[4026.80 → 4027.18] God
[4027.18 → 4027.88] designs
[4027.88 → 4028.12] and
[4028.12 → 4028.80] designates
[4028.80 → 4029.42] for
[4029.42 → 4029.86] his
[4029.86 → 4030.42] purposes
[4030.42 → 4031.98] with
[4031.98 → 4032.40] children
[4032.40 → 4032.82] we
[4032.82 → 4033.32] get to
[4033.32 → 4033.74] build
[4033.74 → 4034.10] what
[4034.10 → 4034.36] God
[4034.36 → 4034.52] is
[4034.52 → 4034.82] building
[4034.82 → 4036.14] and
[4036.14 → 4036.60] again
[4036.60 → 4037.10] it's
[4037.10 → 4037.26] the
[4037.26 → 4037.52] same
[4037.52 → 4037.78] way
[4037.78 → 4037.96] with
[4037.96 → 4038.38] everything
[4038.38 → 4038.66] that
[4038.66 → 4038.84] we
[4038.84 → 4039.18] endeavour
[4039.18 → 4039.40] to
[4039.40 → 4039.64] do
[4039.64 → 4039.90] in
[4039.90 → 4040.04] this
[4040.04 → 4040.24] world
[4040.24 → 4040.38] that
[4040.38 → 4040.58] we
[4040.58 → 4040.76] are
[4040.76 → 4041.12] building
[4041.12 → 4041.40] what
[4041.40 → 4041.70] God
[4041.70 → 4041.86] is
[4041.86 → 4042.16] building
[4042.16 → 4042.88] and
[4042.88 → 4043.02] it
[4043.02 → 4043.30] teaches
[4043.30 → 4043.54] us
[4043.54 → 4043.66] that
[4043.66 → 4043.88] God
[4043.88 → 4044.02] is
[4044.02 → 4044.32] working
[4044.32 → 4044.64] through
[4044.64 → 4044.94] you
[4044.94 → 4045.14] and
[4045.14 → 4045.24] he
[4045.24 → 4045.38] is
[4045.38 → 4045.66] building
[4045.66 → 4045.90] through
[4045.90 → 4046.06] your
[4046.06 → 4046.44] life
[4046.44 → 4047.96] and
[4047.96 → 4048.18] you
[4048.18 → 4048.28] know
[4048.28 → 4048.44] what
[4048.44 → 4048.58] we
[4048.58 → 4048.78] see
[4048.78 → 4048.94] this
[4048.94 → 4049.16] throughout
[4049.16 → 4049.32] the
[4049.32 → 4049.46] whole
[4049.46 → 4049.76] Bible
[4049.76 → 4051.22] God
[4051.22 → 4051.94] is
[4051.94 → 4052.46] always
[4052.46 → 4053.16] working
[4053.16 → 4053.80] through
[4053.80 → 4054.42] his
[4054.42 → 4054.96] people
[4054.96 → 4056.00] right
[4056.00 → 4056.16] so
[4056.16 → 4056.52] think
[4056.52 → 4057.00] about
[4057.00 → 4057.80] Abraham
[4057.80 → 4058.18] and
[4058.18 → 4058.46] Sarah
[4058.46 → 4059.28] right
[4059.28 → 4059.58] back
[4059.58 → 4059.70] in
[4059.70 → 4059.78] the
[4059.78 → 4059.90] Old
[4059.90 → 4060.22] Testament
[4060.22 → 4060.76] God
[4060.76 → 4061.10] comes
[4061.10 → 4061.28] to
[4061.28 → 4061.56] Sarah
[4061.56 → 4061.74] and
[4061.74 → 4061.88] he
[4061.88 → 4062.20] says
[4062.20 → 4062.66] I
[4062.66 → 4062.90] want
[4062.90 → 4063.02] to
[4063.02 → 4063.28] work
[4063.28 → 4063.68] through
[4063.68 → 4064.14] you
[4064.14 → 4064.62] Sarah
[4064.62 → 4065.44] even
[4065.44 → 4065.70] though
[4065.70 → 4065.92] you
[4065.92 → 4066.06] are
[4066.06 → 4066.48] barren
[4066.48 → 4066.72] and
[4066.72 → 4067.02] through
[4067.02 → 4067.42] you
[4067.42 → 4067.66] I
[4067.66 → 4067.82] am
[4067.82 → 4068.02] going
[4068.02 → 4068.14] to
[4068.14 → 4068.80] produce
[4068.80 → 4069.18] an
[4069.18 → 4069.62] entire
[4069.62 → 4070.16] people
[4070.16 → 4070.50] the
[4070.50 → 4070.76] people
[4070.76 → 4070.92] of
[4070.92 → 4071.22] Israel
[4071.22 → 4072.44] and
[4072.44 → 4072.54] then
[4072.54 → 4072.80] God
[4072.80 → 4073.08] comes
[4073.08 → 4073.24] to
[4073.24 → 4073.60] Moses
[4073.60 → 4073.88] and
[4073.88 → 4074.06] says
[4074.06 → 4074.38] Moses
[4074.38 → 4074.66] I
[4074.66 → 4074.86] want
[4074.86 → 4074.96] to
[4074.96 → 4075.16] work
[4075.16 → 4075.38] through
[4075.38 → 4075.68] you
[4075.68 → 4075.86] and
[4075.86 → 4076.02] through
[4076.02 → 4076.24] your
[4076.24 → 4076.64] mouth
[4076.64 → 4076.96] even
[4076.96 → 4077.24] though
[4077.24 → 4077.42] it
[4077.42 → 4077.58] is
[4077.58 → 4077.96] weak
[4077.96 → 4078.80] to
[4078.80 → 4079.26] speak
[4079.26 → 4079.52] my
[4079.52 → 4080.18] law
[4080.18 → 4080.68] and
[4080.68 → 4080.90] I
[4080.90 → 4081.06] will
[4081.06 → 4081.42] use
[4081.42 → 4081.58] that
[4081.58 → 4081.72] to
[4081.72 → 4082.16] form

[4160.88 → 4161.30] makes

[4180.80 → 4181.20] we
[4181.20 → 4181.86] sin
[4181.86 → 4182.24] we
[4182.24 → 4182.66] mess

[4193.38 → 4193.54] is
[4193.54 → 4193.84] building
[4193.84 → 4196.04] so
[4196.04 → 4196.28] here's
[4196.28 → 4196.40] the
[4196.40 → 4196.72] question
[4196.72 → 4196.88] of

[4199.12 → 4199.24] think
[4199.24 → 4199.42] what
[4199.42 → 4199.58] we

[4200.24 → 4200.54] as
[4200.54 → 4200.80] a
[4200.80 → 4201.08] way
[4201.08 → 4201.18] of
[4201.18 → 4201.68] application
[4201.68 → 4202.88] what
[4202.88 → 4203.08] does
[4203.08 → 4203.40] God
[4203.40 → 4203.64] want
[4203.64 → 4203.82] to
[4203.82 → 4204.20] build
[4204.20 → 4204.60] in

[4204.78 → 4204.98] through
[4204.98 → 4205.20] your
[4205.20 → 4205.56] life
[4205.56 → 4207.16] what
[4207.16 → 4207.44] is
[4207.44 → 4207.82] God
[4207.82 → 4208.26] building
[4208.26 → 4208.76] in
[4208.76 → 4209.04] and
[4209.04 → 4209.40] through
[4209.40 → 4210.24] your
[4210.24 → 4210.64] life
[4210.64 → 4211.62] I
[4211.62 → 4211.80] love
[4211.80 → 4212.00] a
[4212.00 → 4212.62] conversation
[4212.62 → 4212.84] I'm
[4212.84 → 4212.90] going

[4213.20 → 4213.44] Ted
[4213.44 → 4213.72] here
[4213.72 → 4214.26] I
[4214.26 → 4214.46] went
[4214.46 → 4214.64] to
[4214.64 → 4214.96] talk
[4214.96 → 4215.12] with
[4215.12 → 4215.46] Ted
[4215.46 → 4215.64] and
[4215.64 → 4215.92] he
[4215.92 → 4217.98] said
[4217.98 → 4218.24] Ted
[4218.24 → 4218.40] how
[4218.40 → 4218.54] can

[4218.64 → 4218.78] pray
[4218.78 → 4218.98] for
[4218.98 → 4219.16] you
[4219.16 → 4219.28] and
[4219.28 → 4219.38] he
[4219.38 → 4219.62] said
[4219.62 → 4220.08] that
[4220.08 → 4220.52] God
[4220.52 → 4220.88] would
[4220.88 → 4221.52] tell
[4221.52 → 4221.68] me
[4221.68 → 4221.90] my
[4221.90 → 4222.20] duty
[4222.20 → 4223.46] and
[4223.46 → 4223.54] I
[4223.54 → 4224.16] was
[4224.16 → 4224.72] so
[4224.72 → 4225.04] encouraged
[4225.04 → 4225.24] by

[4226.62 → 4227.00] God
[4227.00 → 4227.28] what's
[4227.28 → 4227.38] the

[4227.72 → 4227.90] you're
[4227.90 → 4228.12] giving
[4228.12 → 4228.26] me
[4228.26 → 4228.40] to
[4228.40 → 4228.66] do
[4228.66 → 4229.92] right
[4229.92 → 4230.18] now

[4231.54 → 4231.66] the
[4231.66 → 4231.92] question

[4304.02 → 4304.16] the
[4304.16 → 4304.64] background
[4304.64 → 4305.92] he
[4305.92 → 4306.04] had
[4306.04 → 4306.18] this
[4306.18 → 4306.46] whole
[4306.46 → 4306.96] image
[4306.96 → 4307.18] in
[4307.18 → 4307.42] his
[4307.42 → 4307.76] head
[4307.76 → 4307.94] of
[4307.94 → 4308.14] what
[4308.14 → 4308.48] this
[4308.48 → 4309.20] tree
[4309.20 → 4309.48] could
[4309.48 → 4309.72] look
[4309.72 → 4309.90] like
[4309.90 → 4310.06] this
[4310.06 → 4310.40] tree
[4310.40 → 4310.58] of
[4310.58 → 4310.92] life
[4310.92 → 4312.14] and
[4312.14 → 4312.24] so
[4312.24 → 4312.44] he
[4312.44 → 4312.88] starts
[4312.88 → 4313.12] onto
[4313.12 → 4313.34] this
[4313.34 → 4313.86] project
[4313.86 → 4314.88] and
[4314.88 → 4315.06] he
[4315.06 → 4315.52] gets
[4315.52 → 4316.34] the

[4318.30 → 4319.64] and
[4319.64 → 4319.74] he
[4319.74 → 4319.96] and
[4319.96 → 4320.14] he's
[4320.14 → 4320.42] also
[4320.42 → 4321.00] so
[4321.00 → 4321.12] he
[4321.12 → 4321.42] just
[4321.42 → 4321.66] can't
[4321.66 → 4321.80] pay
[4321.80 → 4322.16] anything
[4322.16 → 4322.34] and
[4322.34 → 4322.44] then
[4322.44 → 4322.62] he's
[4322.62 → 4322.98] constantly
[4322.98 → 4323.72] interrupted
[4323.72 → 4324.78] by
[4324.78 → 4325.02] other
[4325.02 → 4325.38] people

[4326.30 → 4326.92] and
[4326.92 → 4327.06] for
[4327.06 → 4327.18] the
[4327.18 → 4327.38] rest
[4327.38 → 4327.52] of
[4327.52 → 4327.64] his

[4327.90 → 4328.00] and
[4328.00 → 4328.12] the
[4328.12 → 4328.30] rest
[4328.30 → 4328.44] of
[4328.44 → 4328.58] his
[4328.58 → 4328.94] career
[4328.94 → 4330.26] all
[4330.26 → 4330.58] he's
[4330.58 → 4330.86] able
[4330.86 → 4331.26] to do
[4331.26 → 4331.42] is

[4331.70 → 4332.04] one
[4332.04 → 4332.38] leaf
[4332.38 → 4333.68] only
[4333.68 → 4334.34] one
[4334.34 → 4334.84] leaf
[4334.84 → 4335.18] on
[4335.18 → 4335.46] this
[4335.46 → 4335.84] tree
[4335.84 → 4336.16] that
[4336.16 → 4336.26] he
[4336.26 → 4336.38] was
[4336.38 → 4336.52] going
[4336.52 → 4336.64] to
[4336.64 → 4336.88] paint
[4336.88 → 4338.40] then
[4338.40 → 4339.52] he
[4339.52 → 4339.92] dies
[4339.92 → 4341.20] so
[4341.20 → 4341.32] we
[4341.32 → 4341.46] have
[4341.46 → 4341.62] this
[4341.62 → 4341.92] great
[4341.92 → 4342.50] vision
[4342.50 → 4343.72] that
[4343.72 → 4343.88] he
[4343.88 → 4344.04] could
[4344.04 → 4344.30] never
[4344.30 → 4344.68] actually
[4344.68 → 4345.10] fulfill
[4345.10 → 4345.30] in
[4345.30 → 4345.48] his
[4345.48 → 4345.80] life
[4345.80 → 4347.52] and
[4347.52 → 4347.70] then
[4347.70 → 4347.86] you
[4347.86 → 4348.64] might
[4348.64 → 4348.90] look
[4348.90 → 4349.02] at
[4349.02 → 4349.18] his
[4349.18 → 4349.54] life
[4349.54 → 4349.74] and
[4349.74 → 4350.00] say
[4350.00 → 4351.44] what
[4351.44 → 4351.64] a
[4352.34 → 4354.82] failure
[4354.82 → 4355.70] he
[4355.70 → 4355.84] had
[4355.84 → 4355.96] this
[4355.96 → 4356.22] great
[4356.22 → 4356.52] vision
[4356.52 → 4356.70] for
[4356.70 → 4356.80] all
[4356.80 → 4356.94] this
[4356.94 → 4357.18] work
[4357.18 → 4357.28] he
[4357.28 → 4357.42] was
[4357.42 → 4357.54] going
[4357.54 → 4357.64] to
[4357.64 → 4357.92] do
[4357.92 → 4358.40] all
[4358.40 → 4358.58] that
[4358.58 → 4358.74] it
[4358.74 → 4358.88] could
[4358.88 → 4359.14] be
[4359.14 → 4359.46] and
[4359.46 → 4359.64] all
[4359.64 → 4359.78] he
[4359.78 → 4360.08] painted
[4360.08 → 4360.50] was
[4360.50 → 4360.72] one
[4360.72 → 4361.06] leaf
[4361.06 → 4362.92] but
[4362.92 → 4363.16] then
[4363.16 → 4363.54] Nagel's
[4363.54 → 4363.76] story
[4363.76 → 4363.90] is
[4363.90 → 4364.06] not
[4364.06 → 4364.34] over
[4364.34 → 4365.46] because
[4365.46 → 4365.70] then
[4365.70 → 4365.98] Nagel
[4365.98 → 4366.30] finds
[4366.30 → 4366.64] himself
[4366.64 → 4366.80] on
[4366.80 → 4366.92] a
[4366.92 → 4367.28] train
[4367.28 → 4367.66] going
[4367.66 → 4367.84] to
[4367.84 → 4368.08] heaven
[4368.08 → 4369.32] and
[4369.32 → 4369.78] he's
[4369.78 → 4369.98] riding
[4369.98 → 4370.12] on
[4370.12 → 4370.24] the
[4370.24 → 4370.52] train
[4370.52 → 4370.68] and
[4370.68 → 4370.76] he
[4370.76 → 4370.88] has
[4370.88 → 4371.00] a
[4371.00 → 4371.42] guide
[4371.42 → 4372.58] in
[4372.58 → 4372.96] heaven
[4372.96 → 4374.12] and
[4374.12 → 4374.60] Nagel
[4374.60 → 4374.90] and
[4374.90 → 4375.16] the
[4375.16 → 4375.38] guide
[4375.38 → 4375.96] points
[4375.96 → 4376.54] into
[4376.54 → 4376.72] the
[4376.72 → 4377.18] distance
[4377.18 → 4377.46] to
[4377.46 → 4377.72] this
[4377.72 → 4378.40] tall
[4378.40 → 4378.86] beautiful
[4378.86 → 4379.26] tree
[4379.26 → 4380.26] and
[4380.26 → 4380.42] Nagel
[4380.42 → 4380.58] says
[4380.58 → 4380.82] stop
[4380.82 → 4380.96] the
[4380.96 → 4381.34] train
[4381.34 → 4382.46] he
[4382.46 → 4383.30] recognizes
[4383.30 → 4383.58] this

[4420.24 → 4420.48] this
[4420.48 → 4420.90] story
[4420.90 → 4421.72] is
[4421.72 → 4421.88] that
[4421.88 → 4422.68] what
[4422.68 → 4423.02] we
[4423.02 → 4425.74] want
[4425.74 → 4427.58] is
[4427.58 → 4427.82] for
[4427.82 → 4428.00] the
[4428.00 → 4428.20] work
[4428.20 → 4428.36] that
[4428.36 → 4428.52] we
[4428.52 → 4428.80] do
[4428.80 → 4429.24] in
[4429.24 → 4429.62] this
[4429.62 → 4429.96] life

[4430.50 → 4430.82] meaning
[4430.82 → 4431.84] right
[4431.84 → 4432.00] we
[4432.00 → 4432.24] want
[4432.24 → 4432.38] to
[4432.38 → 4432.52] know
[4432.52 → 4432.66] that
[4432.66 → 4432.76] our
[4432.76 → 4432.92] work
[4432.92 → 4433.26] means
[4433.26 → 4433.68] something
[4433.68 → 4433.86] and
[4433.86 → 4434.02] that
[4434.02 → 4434.18] it
[4434.18 → 4434.34] is
[4434.34 → 4434.88] significant
[4434.88 → 4435.76] and
[4435.76 → 4435.94] so
[4435.94 → 4436.34] often
[4436.34 → 4436.82] we
[4436.82 → 4437.04] don't

[4440.24 → 4440.40] and
[4440.40 → 4440.64] live
[4440.64 → 4440.76] and
[4440.76 → 4440.90] we
[4440.90 → 4441.16] work
[4441.16 → 4441.30] and
[4441.30 → 4441.50] work
[4441.50 → 4441.64] and
[4441.64 → 4442.00] work
[4442.00 → 4442.40] and
[4442.40 → 4442.56] then
[4442.56 → 4442.98] we
[4442.98 → 4443.44] die
[4443.44 → 4443.62] and
[4443.62 → 4443.74] we
[4443.74 → 4444.02] ask
[4444.02 → 4444.28] what

[4566.42 → 4566.56] we
[4566.56 → 4566.72] do
[4566.72 → 4566.94] so
[4566.94 → 4567.16] Lord
[4567.16 → 4567.66] everything

[4597.38 → 4597.76] name
[4597.76 → 4598.46] Amen
[4598.46 → 4601.44] So

[4620.60 → 4621.52] be
[4621.52 → 4624.06] consecrated
[4624.06 → 4625.20] Lord
[4625.20 → 4625.80] to

[4626.70 → 4627.90] Take

[4721.50 → 4722.24] as
[4722.24 → 4722.78] thou
[4722.78 → 4723.50] shalt
[4723.50 → 4724.68] choose
[4724.68 → 4726.04] Every
[4726.04 → 4727.34] power
[4727.34 → 4728.12] as
[4728.12 → 4728.82] thou
[4728.82 → 4729.74] shalt
[4729.74 → 4731.18] choose
[4731.18 → 4732.86] Please be
[4732.86 → 4733.14] seated.
[4733.14 → 4753.30] too
[4753.30 → 4754.14] Oh
[4754.14 → 4754.68] there we
[4754.68 → 4754.82] are
[4754.82 → 4755.78] who
[4755.78 → 4757.00] has
[4757.00 → 4757.40] had some
[4757.40 → 4757.58] health
[4757.58 → 4757.82] issues
[4757.82 → 4758.26] this week
[4758.26 → 4758.56] and she
[4758.56 → 4758.82] is now
[4758.82 → 4758.96] in
[4758.96 → 4759.14] Delta
[4759.14 → 4759.60] hospital
[4759.60 → 4764.88] undergoing some tests. So we'll pray especially for her. And for others who are sick in our
[4764.88 → 4771.28] community, then we'll also just pray about our work. Pray for essential workers. Pray for the
[4771.28 → 4774.82] work that God has given us to do. So let's pray for those things. Would you pray with me?
[4776.66 → 4783.78] Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, we pray for those in our community who need your
[4783.78 → 4793.00] healing, for their bodies, you're healing in their lives. Lord, we lift to you Pat right now as
[4793.00 → 4803.26] she's in Delta Hospital. We also pray for Joan, Cor, Andre, Carl, Grace, Hank, Shirley, Honda, Diane,
[4803.90 → 4810.54] Get, Jeanette, John, and Henry. Father, would you show them your mercy and bring healing to them?
[4810.54 → 4819.96] Father, we also continue to ask that you would be with Jeanette as she still continues to grieve
[4819.96 → 4833.26] the loss of John. Lord, we also pray today for just this theme and topic of work. Lord, we are your
[4833.26 → 4840.38] workers because you have made us like you. But we confess that our work does not always honour you in
[4840.38 → 4847.88] our neighbour. We often work for our own gain rather than for your glory. And we've carried out our work
[4847.88 → 4854.64] in ways that do not advance your kingdom, but maybe advance our own. And we have ignored and failed to
[4854.64 → 4864.66] act on behalf of those who suffer injustice in their labour in this world. Lord, forgive us and renew
[4864.66 → 4871.78] our work for your glory. Lord, we especially pray for essential workers still in this season of COVID
[4871.78 → 4880.56] as they risk exposure to care, to feed, to heal, to serve, to teach, to protect us. Lord, we especially
[4880.56 → 4887.84] pray for teachers as schools are getting back going. We pray for firefighters now who are still fighting
[4887.84 → 4897.28] fires that are ravaging for us. Lord, be their strength and their protector. Lord, would you be at work in the work
[4897.28 → 4905.02] that they do? We pray for business owners who are struggling to keep their businesses going in this difficult
[4905.02 → 4913.66] economic time. Lord, pour out your spirit on those who need your extra comfort and peace and stability in this
[4913.66 → 4921.18] difficult season of which we are all trying to work. Give us grace to persevere in the trials that we
[4921.18 → 4929.02] experience and to rejoice still in the labours that you place before us. Holy Spirit, empower all of us
[4929.02 → 4937.32] in this season of work, whether we are young or old, children or adults, students, whether we're paid or
[4937.32 → 4945.40] unpaid. Lord, give us grace today in the coming days that we might serve you well by loving and serving others,
[4946.12 → 4953.24] labouring in view of that day when your kingdom will be fully realized at the great restoration of our world.
[4954.28 → 4963.32] Empower us to pray and work for that day with all of our strength and in love that you provide. Lord, in your mercy,
[4963.32 → 4967.32] hear our prayers. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4969.72 → 4976.60] Friends, let's stand again and go out to work for the Lord with his blessing upon us. I invite you to
[4976.60 → 4982.36] hold out your hands as a gesture, receiving this commission and blessing. To him who is able to keep
[4982.36 → 4987.48] you from stumbling, to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4987.48 → 4994.52] To the only God our Saviour be glory, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages,
[4995.08 → 4997.32] now and forevermore. Amen.
[4997.32 → 4997.94] Amen.
[4998.54 → 5000.60] Amen.
[5000.60 → 5018.34] O Lord my God,
[5018.34 → 5023.88] When I in awesome wonders
[5023.88 → 5032.94] Consider all the works Thy hands have made
[5032.94 → 5041.72] I see the stars, I hear them mighty thunder
[5041.72 → 5050.72] Thy power throughout the universe displayed
[5050.72 → 5060.72] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[5060.72 → 5070.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5070.76 → 5079.76] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[5079.76 → 5089.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5089.76 → 5098.76] But when I think that God His Son of Spare
[5098.76 → 5108.76] Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
[5108.76 → 5119.76] That on the cross my burden badly bearing
[5119.76 → 5128.76] He bled and died to take away my sin
[5128.76 → 5138.76] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[5138.76 → 5147.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5147.76 → 5149.76] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[5149.76 → 5151.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5151.76 → 5162.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5162.76 → 5169.76] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[5169.76 → 5179.76] When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
