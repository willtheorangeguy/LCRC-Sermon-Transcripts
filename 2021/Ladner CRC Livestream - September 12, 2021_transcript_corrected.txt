[2299.46 → 2300.46] Yep, come on.
[2300.46 → 2302.94] A banana, yep.
[2302.94 → 2309.94] Have a seat.
[2309.94 → 2314.94] All right.
[2314.94 → 2315.94] Okay.
[2315.94 → 2317.94] Here we are.
[2317.94 → 2327.94] Oh, it's great to see you all today.
[2327.94 → 2332.76] Today what I want to do is I want to see what things
[2332.76 → 2336.76] float and what things do not float.
[2336.76 → 2339.76] Yeah.
[2339.76 → 2343.76] That's, this is the big, I don't know what's going to happen with this.
[2343.76 → 2344.76] We're going to see.
[2344.76 → 2345.76] It's going to float.
[2345.76 → 2346.76] You think so?
[2346.76 → 2347.76] Okay.
[2347.76 → 2351.76] So what we're going to do is I'm going to ask each item, do you think it's going to
[2351.76 → 2353.76] float, and we'll vote, and then we'll try it.
[2353.76 → 2354.76] Okay?
[2354.76 → 2355.76] All right.
[2355.76 → 2356.76] So which one should we start with?
[2356.76 → 2357.76] How about this?
[2357.76 → 2358.76] Is this going to float?
[2358.76 → 2359.76] Float.
[2359.76 → 2360.76] Float.
[2360.76 → 2361.76] Sink.
[2361.76 → 2362.76] Sink.
[2362.76 → 2363.76] Float.
[2363.76 → 2364.76] Float.
[2364.76 → 2365.76] Okay.
[2365.76 → 2366.76] Let's see what happens.
[2366.76 → 2367.76] Ready?
[2367.76 → 2368.76] Oh.
[2368.76 → 2369.76] It floats.
[2369.76 → 2370.76] I thought it would sink.
[2370.76 → 2371.76] Okay.
[2371.76 → 2373.76] What do I know?
[2373.76 → 2374.76] All right.
[2374.76 → 2375.76] How about this?
[2375.76 → 2376.76] Sink.
[2376.76 → 2377.76] Sink.
[2377.76 → 2378.76] Sink.
[2378.76 → 2379.76] Sink.

[2384.76 → 2385.76] Sink.
[2385.76 → 2386.76] Sink.
[2386.76 → 2387.76] Sink.
[2387.76 → 2388.76] Right.
[2388.76 → 2389.76] You're right.
[2389.76 → 2390.76] Sink.
[2390.76 → 2391.76] Sink.
[2391.76 → 2392.76] Sink.
[2392.76 → 2393.76] Lee…
[2393.76 → 2394.76] Sink.
[2394.76 → 2395.76] Sink.
[2395.76 → 2396.76] Ninety commodity.
[2396.76 → 2397.76] That sunk.
[2397.76 → 2398.76] Sink.
[2398.76 → 2399.76] Sink.
[2399.76 → 2400.74] Sink.
[2400.74 → 2401.26] Sink.
[2401.26 → 2401.76] All right.
[2402.76 → 2403.76] Sink.
[2403.76 → 2404.76] Sink.
[2405.08 → 2405.58] Sink.
[2405.58 → 2406.32] All right.
[2406.32 → 2407.16] Sink.
[2407.20 → 2407.98] Sink.
[2408.02 → 2408.32] Sink.
[2408.32 → 2409.16] Sink.
[2409.16 → 2409.62] Sink.
[2409.62 → 2410.76] What do you think about this one?
[2410.76 → 2411.40] Float.
[2412.06 → 2412.62] Float.
[2413.12 → 2413.66] Float.
[2413.78 → 2414.66] Float?
[2414.66 → 2415.06] Float.
[2415.74 → 2416.76] Still floats.
[2418.12 → 2418.64] All right.
[2418.66 → 2419.56] Because it's a paper.
[2420.04 → 2420.24] Yeah.
[2420.50 → 2421.16] And the banana.
[2421.76 → 2422.28] What do you think?
[2422.30 → 2423.02] It's pretty heavy.
[2423.44 → 2423.84] Float.
[2424.24 → 2424.54] Sink?
[2424.68 → 2425.04] Float.
[2425.10 → 2426.20] Who says float?
[2426.72 → 2427.10] Float.
[2427.48 → 2427.84] Float.
[2428.76 → 2429.54] Who says sink?
[2429.70 → 2430.12] Sink.
[2430.50 → 2430.92] Sink.
[2431.10 → 2431.30] Sink.
[2431.30 → 2432.46] Some people say, okay, ready?
[2433.00 → 2433.26] Sink.
[2433.26 → 2433.38] Sink.
[2433.38 → 2433.70] Sink.
[2433.70 → 2433.76] Sink.
[2433.76 → 2434.12] Sink.
[2434.12 → 2434.20] Sink.
[2435.72 → 2436.00] Float.
[2436.00 → 2436.32] Whoa.
[2437.54 → 2438.56] Bananas float.
[2438.98 → 2439.96] Can you see it?
[2440.02 → 2440.60] You see it?
[2440.60 → 2441.34] Here, watch out.
[2441.36 → 2441.98] Let everyone see.
[2444.68 → 2445.04] Okay.
[2445.72 → 2446.12] See?
[2446.24 → 2446.62] It floats.
[2447.26 → 2447.62] Okay.
[2447.98 → 2448.20] Great.
[2448.58 → 2449.94] Now, everyone go sit back down.
[2452.12 → 2453.44] I have a question for you.
[2453.70 → 2453.90] Okay.
[2453.98 → 2454.24] No more.
[2454.34 → 2454.58] No more.
[2455.80 → 2456.16] Okay.
[2456.36 → 2456.80] Go ahead.
[2456.86 → 2457.18] Sit down.
[2457.30 → 2457.66] Sit down.
[2457.80 → 2458.10] Yes.
[2458.32 → 2458.60] Yes.
[2458.84 → 2459.10] Okay.
[2460.02 → 2460.38] Question.
[2460.38 → 2464.34] Are you a floater or a sinker?
[2464.90 → 2465.46] Floater.
[2465.92 → 2466.68] Who wants to jump in?
[2466.74 → 2466.92] Try.
[2467.86 → 2468.38] Me.
[2468.68 → 2469.26] You want to do it?
[2469.68 → 2469.92] Okay.
[2469.92 → 2470.00] Okay.
[2470.36 → 2471.24] So that's our question.
[2471.42 → 2472.16] How about you?
[2473.44 → 2475.00] Are you a floater or a sinker?
[2475.18 → 2477.48] So, I want to read a story from the Bible.
[2477.96 → 2478.82] One time in the Bible.
[2480.44 → 2481.46] Hey, listen.
[2481.70 → 2481.90] Listen.
[2482.38 → 2482.88] One time.
[2484.08 → 2484.48] Okay.
[2488.16 → 2488.52] Okay.
[2488.76 → 2493.40] One time in the Bible, Jesus was with his disciples.
[2493.76 → 2494.52] Hey, can you listen?
[2494.70 → 2494.92] Listen.
[2494.92 → 2495.52] Shh.
[2495.52 → 2503.52] One time Jesus was with his disciples and Jesus told his disciples to get in a boat and to go to the other side of the lake.
[2503.72 → 2507.42] Well, Jesus himself, he wanted to go and be alone and pray to God.
[2507.42 → 2512.68] So, what happened is the disciples got in the boat, and they started to row out into the lake.
[2513.00 → 2513.56] And what happened?
[2514.88 → 2521.06] The wind started to blow, and the waves started to get bigger, and it was a storm.
[2521.06 → 2526.20] And the disciples felt very afraid because it was a big storm and the boat was shaking.
[2527.02 → 2532.28] So, then they saw Jesus all of a sudden walking on the water.
[2533.48 → 2534.10] He was like floating.
[2534.44 → 2536.90] He was walking on the water, and he was coming toward the boat.
[2536.90 → 2540.98] So, let me read what it said to you in chapter 14.
[2543.46 → 2545.80] Jesus said to them, take courage.
[2546.10 → 2546.68] It is I.
[2546.76 → 2547.50] Don't be afraid.
[2548.30 → 2549.58] Why bubbles sink?
[2549.66 → 2550.10] Just a minute.
[2550.96 → 2551.32] Listen.
[2552.00 → 2556.76] Lord, if it's you, Peter replied, tell me to come to you on the water.
[2557.46 → 2558.80] What did Jesus say to Peter?
[2559.94 → 2560.38] Come.
[2561.24 → 2561.40] Right?
[2561.62 → 2564.90] Jesus invited Peter to get out of the boat and to walk on the water.
[2564.90 → 2572.18] So, Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
[2572.40 → 2579.52] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and he began to sink, crying out, Lord, save me.
[2580.06 → 2582.82] Immediately, Jesus reached out his hand and caught him.
[2583.26 → 2585.92] You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt?
[2586.80 → 2588.30] So, listen up, kids.
[2588.44 → 2588.60] Ready?
[2589.28 → 2589.56] Listen.
[2590.30 → 2593.30] Sometimes in life, you will face storms.
[2593.94 → 2594.56] Did you know that?
[2594.56 → 2596.66] Look, you can't touch it because not everyone can touch.
[2596.96 → 2597.80] Not everyone can touch.
[2597.88 → 2599.08] So, you have to sit down and leave it.
[2600.04 → 2600.24] Okay?
[2600.58 → 2602.74] So, sometimes in life, there will be...
[2602.74 → 2603.26] No, no, no.
[2603.34 → 2604.56] Oh, I said...
[2604.56 → 2606.10] All right.
[2606.22 → 2607.58] So, let's take it out.
[2607.98 → 2609.00] We're going to take him out.
[2609.34 → 2609.64] Yes.
[2610.42 → 2610.76] Yeah.
[2610.84 → 2611.08] Thanks.
[2611.20 → 2611.42] Thanks.
[2611.94 → 2612.54] Thank you.
[2613.08 → 2613.50] Thank you.
[2613.58 → 2613.96] Thank you.
[2614.30 → 2614.84] Thank you.
[2615.34 → 2615.58] Okay.
[2617.80 → 2618.12] Okay.
[2618.80 → 2619.46] You guys ready?
[2619.54 → 2620.52] You have to listen to the point.
[2620.52 → 2624.04] Just a minute.
[2624.48 → 2625.20] We'll talk about bubbles.
[2625.26 → 2625.84] Ask your Sundays.
[2625.92 → 2626.64] We'll teach you about bubbles.
[2627.40 → 2627.62] Okay.
[2628.26 → 2630.08] So, we're going to face storms in life.
[2630.14 → 2634.62] But as long as we keep our eyes on Jesus, then...
[2634.62 → 2637.76] And if we put our trust in him, then we will be okay.
[2638.08 → 2638.88] We won't sink.
[2639.12 → 2639.30] Right?
[2639.30 → 2647.04] But if we take our eyes off of Jesus, then we will sink.
[2647.18 → 2647.58] That's right.
[2648.02 → 2648.22] Okay?
[2648.26 → 2648.96] Can you remember that?
[2649.66 → 2652.62] Keep your eyes on Jesus and you won't sink.
[2653.12 → 2653.32] Okay?
[2653.58 → 2654.54] Let me pray for us.
[2654.98 → 2655.50] Let's pray.
[2656.56 → 2657.30] Let's pray.
[2657.76 → 2664.18] Dear Jesus, when the storms of life come against us, help us keep our eyes on you and put our
[2664.18 → 2664.82] trust in you.
[2665.22 → 2665.74] Amen.
[2665.74 → 2665.88] Amen.
[2666.88 → 2667.28] Okay.
[2667.78 → 2673.90] So, go ahead to your classes if you are in grade one and below.
[2674.64 → 2675.24] Okay.
[2675.64 → 2675.86] Okay.
[2675.92 → 2677.46] If you're in grade two, you stay here.
[2677.80 → 2678.04] Okay.
[2678.04 → 2678.30] Go ahead.
[2678.30 → 2678.80] Okay.
[2678.80 → 2680.44] Go ahead.
[2695.74 → 2713.60] Okay.
[2713.60 → 2718.40] Okay.
[2718.40 → 2718.52] Okay.
[2718.52 → 2741.94] Take care.
[2741.94 → 2758.06] Psalm 131.
[2758.06 → 2761.12] My heart is not proud, Lord.
[2761.38 → 2763.38] My eyes are not haughty.
[2763.80 → 2768.74] I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.
[2769.08 → 2771.02] But I have calmed and quieted myself.
[2771.64 → 2773.92] I am like a weaned child with its mother.
[2774.54 → 2776.44] Like a weaned child, I am content.
[2777.26 → 2781.02] Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forevermore.
[2781.02 → 2781.12] Amen.
[2781.12 → 2781.20] Amen.
[2781.20 → 2781.22] Amen.
[2781.22 → 2781.28] Amen.
[2781.28 → 2781.30] Amen.
[2781.30 → 2781.36] Amen.
[2781.36 → 2781.42] Amen.
[2781.42 → 2781.52] Amen.
[2781.52 → 2781.62] Amen.
[2781.62 → 2781.68] Amen.
[2781.68 → 2781.72] Amen.
[2788.06 → 2788.60] Great job.
[2789.50 → 2790.12] That was awesome.
[2797.56 → 2797.90] All right.
[2797.90 → 2803.32] So, friends, we have been going through a series called the Songs for the Journey.
[2803.94 → 2806.08] They are in the Psalms of Ascent.
[2806.94 → 2813.32] And so these were psalms that the people of Israel would sing as they travelled up to the
[2813.32 → 2814.06] city of Jerusalem.
[2814.06 → 2819.76] And so they would sing these psalms as they made the journey to prepare their hearts to
[2819.76 → 2823.92] worship God and then to centre their lives on God alone.
[2824.82 → 2830.20] And so my hope for us this morning is that we would use this psalm in the same way, that
[2830.20 → 2836.78] we would use it to centre our own hearts and our lives on God because God loves you and
[2836.78 → 2840.58] he seeks with joy to draw you into his life.
[2840.58 → 2844.50] And so today we're going to be looking at Psalm 131.
[2845.42 → 2848.56] And Peyton read it for us already, and she did an amazing job.
[2850.06 → 2853.42] And so Psalm 131 is written by King David.
[2853.98 → 2857.08] So at the top of this psalm, you'll see the subscription, it says, of David.
[2858.00 → 2862.00] And one of the unique things about this psalm is that it's really short.
[2862.56 → 2865.10] It's only three verses long.
[2865.10 → 2869.90] And yet the preacher, Charles Spurgeon, said this about Psalm 131.
[2870.32 → 2875.98] He said, it's one of the easiest psalms to read, but one of the hardest to learn.
[2877.30 → 2878.84] It's one of the easiest psalms to read.
[2878.88 → 2881.34] It's only three verses, but it's the hardest to learn.
[2881.82 → 2882.84] And I think he was right.
[2884.00 → 2884.24] Okay.
[2884.86 → 2886.70] So let me pray for us.
[2886.96 → 2892.58] And before I do, for the kids who are here, I don't know if you got a sermon note sheet.
[2892.58 → 2897.86] So if you don't have one, maybe an usher could bring it for you.
[2898.20 → 2899.18] Hannah has some there.
[2900.12 → 2902.64] And so it helps you to follow along with the sermon.
[2903.08 → 2903.20] Okay.
[2904.08 → 2905.00] So let me pray.
[2907.46 → 2912.64] Our Heavenly Father, we come now before you as your children to hear your word to us.
[2913.96 → 2915.80] Lord, you seek us.
[2916.26 → 2917.16] You love us.
[2918.18 → 2921.40] May, by the Holy Spirit, you help us to respond to you.
[2921.40 → 2924.44] And to know you more and love you.
[2924.64 → 2925.66] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2925.96 → 2926.24] Amen.
[2927.82 → 2933.86] So one of my kids' favourite books, when they were younger, is the story of Ferdinand.
[2934.60 → 2937.24] So Ferdinand is a bull who lived in Spain.
[2937.56 → 2938.50] So I'll show you the photo.
[2938.82 → 2939.44] There's Ferdinand.
[2939.52 → 2940.70] This is from the old book.
[2941.12 → 2943.08] There's actually a movie that came out a couple of years ago.
[2943.22 → 2945.64] I don't know if you saw it, but there's the drawing from the book.
[2945.64 → 2955.04] So Ferdinand, he likes to sit quietly in his favourite spot under the tree on the top of a hill.
[2955.84 → 2956.66] So there he is.
[2957.66 → 2959.04] It was his favourite tree.
[2959.26 → 2964.02] He would always go there, and he would sit in its shade all day and smell the flowers.
[2964.94 → 2968.34] And it's a cork tree, so you can see the corks growing on the tree.
[2968.34 → 2979.04] But all the other bulls who had grown up with Ferdinand in the same pasture, what they liked to do was fight each other all day long.
[2979.32 → 2980.30] They would butt each other.
[2980.40 → 2981.88] They would stick each other with their horns.
[2981.88 → 2990.44] And what they wanted most of all was to go to the big city of Madrid and to fight in the bullfighting arena in Madrid.
[2991.28 → 2992.38] But not Ferdinand.
[2993.00 → 2999.86] Even though Ferdinand was actually the bigger and the stronger bull, if he wanted to fight, he would beat them all.
[3000.56 → 3002.12] But he just didn't want to do that.
[3002.24 → 3006.00] He just liked to sit quietly under the cork tree and smell the flowers.
[3006.92 → 3008.76] That's what made him happy.
[3008.76 → 3017.48] And the thing I like most about this story, and actually as I was looking this up this week, I found out it was Gandhi's favourite story.
[3017.88 → 3020.58] And President Roosevelt had a copy in the White House.
[3021.02 → 3022.70] So I was like, oh, I didn't know these things.
[3023.76 → 3024.58] But it's a great story.
[3025.36 → 3033.54] And one thing I like about it is that it gives us these two contrasting pictures about how to find contentment in life.
[3034.68 → 3036.50] What is life all about?
[3036.50 → 3040.88] How do we find satisfaction and contentment and happiness in life?
[3041.70 → 3044.20] What does it mean to be happy and satisfied?
[3045.08 → 3051.26] For most of the young bulls, their dream was to prove that they were the strongest and the bravest.
[3051.68 → 3054.52] They wanted to go out into that bullfighting ring.
[3054.66 → 3058.04] They wanted to kind of prance around and let everybody see them.
[3058.04 → 3063.50] And hear the crowds cheering for them and win glory and fame for themselves.
[3064.54 → 3069.20] They thought that that would truly make them feel content.
[3070.02 → 3076.70] But for Ferdinand, his idea of contentment was to just sit under a tree and look at the beautiful scenery and smell the flowers.
[3076.70 → 3083.36] And I think the story of Ferdinand helps us get at what this psalm is all about.
[3083.72 → 3085.92] Because the question of this psalm is this.
[3086.14 → 3087.88] How do we find contentment?
[3088.70 → 3090.86] Is it making it to the top?
[3091.42 → 3092.48] Being the best?
[3092.62 → 3093.70] Being the smartest?
[3093.94 → 3094.80] Being the wealthiest?
[3094.80 → 3098.62] Or is it surrounding yourself with the comforts of life?
[3098.70 → 3103.20] Maybe having that house in the countryside, right?
[3105.68 → 3111.52] Or maybe we should ask, well, how does the Bible define contentment?
[3112.16 → 3118.74] How are we to understand happiness and contentment when we bring God into the picture?
[3119.24 → 3123.08] And let him tell us what life is all about.
[3123.08 → 3131.10] So this morning, I want to look at this passage together and talk about and think about together this idea of contentment.
[3131.62 → 3134.26] And we're going to look at three things, three questions.
[3134.80 → 3135.78] What is contentment?
[3136.76 → 3139.18] What does it look like when you have it in your life?
[3139.96 → 3141.22] And then how do you get it?
[3142.04 → 3142.94] Okay, so that's what we'll do today.
[3143.02 → 3144.90] So what is contentment is our first point.
[3145.64 → 3147.28] What does it mean to be content?
[3147.28 → 3153.20] So first, one of the mistaken, one of the wrong ideas that we have about contentment
[3153.20 → 3160.36] is that we often think that contentment has a lot to do with our circumstances and what is happening in our life.
[3160.90 → 3166.62] So if we are on the mountaintops, right, if things are going well, we feel great.
[3166.84 → 3167.62] We feel content.
[3167.62 → 3173.88] But if life is hard, if we are in the valleys, then we're not content.
[3174.68 → 3176.58] Instead, we are restless.
[3177.66 → 3180.46] Maybe we are angry, or we're fearful.
[3182.06 → 3187.22] And friends, we do this all the time, myself included, right?
[3187.24 → 3192.44] We live as if our contentment has a lot to do with our circumstances.
[3192.44 → 3197.74] But in the book of Philippians, the apostle Paul says this.
[3198.08 → 3202.50] He says, I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
[3203.62 → 3204.24] Isn't that amazing?
[3204.94 → 3209.56] I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
[3210.14 → 3213.36] So he tells the Philippian church that he's learned to be content when things are going well
[3213.36 → 3215.52] and when things are going badly.
[3216.84 → 3219.72] And so true contentment, therefore, the way God defines it,
[3219.72 → 3226.18] has to do with something that we can have and experience in all of life's circumstances.
[3227.16 → 3227.30] Right?
[3227.40 → 3231.56] It's not rooted in our accomplishments or our failures.
[3231.88 → 3236.00] It's not determined by the highs or the lows of life.
[3237.14 → 3238.56] So what then is contentment?
[3239.66 → 3241.74] Verse 2, this is what David says.
[3241.74 → 3245.24] But I have calmed and quieted myself.
[3245.24 → 3248.16] I am like a weaned child with its mother.
[3248.66 → 3251.22] Like a weaned child, I am content.
[3251.82 → 3252.04] Right?
[3252.08 → 3253.08] It's a beautiful verse.
[3253.16 → 3254.14] And notice the repetition.
[3254.34 → 3256.66] He's just really trying to drive home this point, this image.
[3257.64 → 3264.26] So David here, he's giving us this very personal, very vivid, very down-to-earth illustration
[3264.26 → 3266.52] of what it looks like to be content.
[3267.10 → 3271.22] He says to be content is like being a baby in its mother's arms.
[3271.58 → 3271.72] Right?
[3271.72 → 3272.48] Just imagine that.
[3272.54 → 3277.78] There's nothing much more content than a baby being held in his mother's arms.
[3279.00 → 3285.30] So a couple of years ago, my family, my kids in particular, really wanted a pet.
[3286.36 → 3288.92] So we weren't able to get a dog or a cat.
[3289.04 → 3292.24] We were only allowed to get something that stays in a cage.
[3292.24 → 3298.14] So we did some research to find what could live in a cage and what we wanted, and we decided
[3298.14 → 3299.46] to get rats.
[3300.00 → 3302.84] I totally didn't know about this.
[3303.24 → 3305.10] But yes, rats can be pets.
[3305.62 → 3306.66] And they are great.
[3306.82 → 3307.66] They're great pets.
[3308.24 → 3309.24] They are clean.
[3309.40 → 3311.14] They clean themselves like cats do.
[3311.62 → 3313.02] They are very smart.
[3313.86 → 3315.44] And they're very sociable.
[3315.60 → 3316.46] They want to be held.
[3316.54 → 3317.60] They want to interact and play.
[3317.70 → 3318.82] So they were great.
[3318.82 → 3322.26] So we brought them home, and all of us were really excited.
[3323.50 → 3328.14] A few days later, so first we had two rats, Rosie and Millie.
[3329.10 → 3330.00] They were cute.
[3330.10 → 3330.62] They were friendly.
[3331.56 → 3337.36] A few days later, to our surprise, we suddenly had not two rats, but 22 rats.
[3338.66 → 3340.38] Rosie and Millie were both pregnant.
[3340.82 → 3341.30] Surprise.
[3341.30 → 3341.70] Surprise.
[3342.64 → 3349.42] So we had this unique experience to see these tiny babies grow up for about a month until
[3349.42 → 3352.94] they were ready to leave their mother and go back to the breeder where they belong.
[3354.08 → 3359.10] We actually did decide to keep one, the cutest one, so then we had three, named Lavender.
[3359.10 → 3364.98] But when they were nursing, it was crazy.
[3365.54 → 3369.98] They would all cry, and they would kind of make this squeaking, little peeping sound like
[3369.98 → 3370.64] a baby bird.
[3371.14 → 3374.00] And they were so demanding of their mothers.
[3374.36 → 3380.06] And the mom would feed them, very patiently, kind of, and then get up and try to get away.
[3380.38 → 3386.16] And the babies would try to chase the mom to eat more.
[3386.16 → 3394.22] But when they were finally content, they were calm, they were quiet, and they were kind
[3394.22 → 3395.80] of snuggled up with their mother.
[3396.86 → 3398.92] And of course, human babies are the same way.
[3399.18 → 3404.38] And that's the image of this psalm, that David is saying just as a child is simply content
[3404.38 → 3412.74] to be in his mother's arms, so the Christian is content to simply be in the arms of his or
[3412.74 → 3413.68] her heavenly father.
[3413.68 → 3416.84] So here's the question for us to consider.
[3417.92 → 3424.42] Are you like an unweaned child, or are you like a weaned child of God?
[3425.26 → 3432.66] The Bible says there's a difference between childlike faith and childish faith, right?
[3432.76 → 3435.18] Childlike faith is a good thing, right?
[3435.22 → 3438.44] That as children of God, we trust in God.
[3438.44 → 3441.20] We go to God, right?
[3441.26 → 3447.22] We know his love for us, and that's all our hearts want or need.
[3447.90 → 3448.88] And so we are content.
[3449.92 → 3453.32] But childish faith is not a good thing.
[3453.72 → 3456.88] And childish faith is like an unweaned child.
[3457.88 → 3458.88] So here's the question.
[3459.08 → 3462.16] Are you angry and demanding with God right now?
[3462.16 → 3466.06] Are you angry and demanding with God right now?
[3466.26 → 3473.00] Are you crying out, I'm not getting my way, and feeling very unsettled with all the things
[3473.00 → 3475.42] that are happening in your heart and in your life?
[3476.30 → 3480.52] You know, for some of us, maybe you feel that God is withholding things from you, right?
[3480.52 → 3487.96] Maybe some sort of comfort that you wish you had, or maybe a relationship, or maybe children, or your health.
[3489.32 → 3495.54] And in the midst of God withholding those things, are you like a weaned child or an unweaned child?
[3496.22 → 3496.34] Right?
[3496.40 → 3499.14] Are you angry and demanding negatively?
[3499.14 → 3507.42] Or are you, you know, perhaps acknowledging those desires that you have in prayer to God,
[3507.48 → 3514.62] but just giving it to God, letting your soul be quieted and at rest because you trust him,
[3514.88 → 3520.04] knowing that he is holding you and that your life, both now and forever, is in his hands.
[3521.42 → 3522.54] Okay, so that's the first point.
[3522.54 → 3531.36] That true contentment, according to David in the Bible, is to have this calmness and quietness of soul
[3531.36 → 3534.18] because you trust in God.
[3535.28 → 3539.42] So now, what does contentment look like in your life?
[3540.74 → 3547.62] And what we see in Psalm 131 is that when we are content in our relationship with God,
[3547.62 → 3555.56] first and foremost, what happens is it changes us, and it flows out into all the other areas of our lives.
[3555.78 → 3558.78] In our relationship with ourselves, as men or women,
[3559.40 → 3565.20] in our relationships with other people, and in our place in the world.
[3566.30 → 3568.26] So in verse 1, is where we're looking,
[3568.44 → 3572.86] David here describes and gives us three descriptions of what contentment looks like.
[3573.60 → 3577.50] So we'll look here at verse 1, and the first one he says, the first line,
[3578.18 → 3579.58] he says, my heart is not proud.
[3580.48 → 3581.52] My heart is not proud.
[3582.04 → 3583.42] So he's talking about his heart.
[3584.06 → 3585.94] And so it's something deep inside.
[3586.50 → 3591.52] And in the Bible, the heart didn't only refer to, as we today think, you know,
[3591.54 → 3593.42] our emotions, our feelings, our heart.
[3593.70 → 3597.32] But in the Hebrew, the heart refers to everything.
[3597.54 → 3598.78] It refers to your whole person.
[3598.78 → 3601.52] The heart is what animates and directs my whole life,
[3601.98 → 3607.24] my affections, my emotions, but also my intellect, my will, all of these other things.
[3608.06 → 3612.52] So he says, my heart, or my soul, myself, is not proud.
[3612.58 → 3614.82] Or in another translation, it's not lifted.
[3615.60 → 3617.80] Meaning, I'm trusting in God.
[3617.96 → 3619.32] I'm trusting in God's sovereignty.
[3619.32 → 3621.20] I'm trusting in God's goodness.
[3622.80 → 3625.60] In 2 Chronicles, we read about King Uzziah.
[3626.44 → 3630.08] And King Uzziah was the king of Judah, and he reigned for 50 years.
[3630.70 → 3632.66] But in verse 16, this is what it says.
[3632.66 → 3634.04] It says about Uzziah.
[3634.98 → 3640.26] After Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall.
[3641.50 → 3645.24] And so as a king, Uzziah had become powerful.
[3645.44 → 3646.62] He had become successful.
[3647.52 → 3650.14] And when that happened, he became proud.
[3650.94 → 3652.70] And then he looked upon God lightly.
[3653.64 → 3656.40] He stopped trusting in God's sovereignty,
[3656.40 → 3659.50] and he started trusting in his own.
[3660.22 → 3662.18] And so we see here that with pride,
[3662.54 → 3664.32] it's going to make you very unsettled.
[3664.50 → 3666.16] It's going to make you prideful,
[3666.76 → 3668.00] where you're going to ignore God.
[3668.62 → 3671.76] So David's talking here, though, about a humility of heart.
[3671.96 → 3673.26] My heart is not proud.
[3673.50 → 3674.38] It's not lifted.
[3674.42 → 3675.64] It's this humility of heart,
[3675.64 → 3679.88] and it comes from being content with our relationship with God.
[3679.88 → 3681.80] We're not going to try to rule our own lives,
[3681.80 → 3685.54] but we acknowledge God's sovereignty over our lives and his lordship.
[3687.14 → 3689.30] So that's the first point that we see here.
[3690.18 → 3693.20] The second picture has to do with our relationships with other people.
[3694.68 → 3698.28] And so our contentment with God not only renews our hearts,
[3698.50 → 3701.38] but it also then affects our relationships with others.
[3701.84 → 3704.04] So this is what David says in the second line.
[3704.64 → 3707.54] My eyes are not haughty.
[3707.54 → 3712.36] So what is going on in our hearts, as we all well know,
[3712.90 → 3717.42] often comes out in the windows of our soul, our eyes.
[3718.00 → 3722.16] And we see this in the way we talk, in our language that we use.
[3722.62 → 3725.34] We say things like, I look up to somebody.
[3726.20 → 3729.00] So you're down here, they're up there,
[3729.08 → 3731.68] and you say, I look up to them,
[3731.72 → 3733.56] and what that means is I admire someone.
[3733.56 → 3737.88] Or we can say, let's look eye to eye.
[3738.00 → 3739.20] Let's talk together.
[3740.02 → 3744.52] Or you can be up here,
[3745.02 → 3748.14] and you look at someone else down there.
[3748.60 → 3750.92] And when you look down on someone,
[3752.18 → 3754.02] that's what David is talking about here.
[3754.66 → 3757.98] And he's referring to that I'm up here, you're down here,
[3758.58 → 3759.64] and that is pride.
[3759.64 → 3760.12] Pride.
[3760.60 → 3762.62] And pride is looking down on someone.
[3763.58 → 3765.34] So this is talking about our relationships
[3765.34 → 3767.34] and how we treat other people,
[3767.42 → 3770.26] the way we exclude others or include them.
[3770.90 → 3772.30] So here's our question for us.
[3773.70 → 3777.76] Who are the people you are tempted to look down on today?
[3779.58 → 3781.78] Let's think of some present-day examples.
[3782.46 → 3786.64] Those who are more cautious and stringent with COVID.
[3786.64 → 3788.66] Do you look down on them?
[3789.36 → 3792.08] Or do you look down on those who are less cautious
[3792.08 → 3793.68] and less stringent with COVID?
[3795.08 → 3797.46] Do you look down on those who,
[3797.66 → 3799.56] in the upcoming election, are voting liberal?
[3800.08 → 3802.42] Or do you look down on those who are voting conservative?
[3802.98 → 3803.88] Or something else?
[3805.26 → 3807.64] Are you accepting and embracing of people
[3807.64 → 3809.26] in the same way that Jesus was,
[3809.52 → 3811.66] eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?
[3812.46 → 3814.52] Or do you avoid certain people?
[3814.52 → 3814.96] Right?
[3815.64 → 3817.46] The answers to these questions will tell us
[3817.46 → 3819.24] whether we are content
[3819.24 → 3821.34] in our relationship with God,
[3821.38 → 3823.46] because then it flows into our relationships
[3823.46 → 3824.30] with other people.
[3825.08 → 3826.64] So then the third thing
[3826.64 → 3830.30] that we see in context of our relationship,
[3830.50 → 3832.46] or being content in our relationship with God,
[3832.60 → 3834.42] gives us this calm and quiet heart.
[3834.58 → 3837.38] It gives us humility in our relationship with others.
[3837.38 → 3840.28] And then the third way that contentment with God
[3840.28 → 3841.38] shapes our life,
[3841.60 → 3844.00] is our relationship to the world
[3844.00 → 3845.26] and our place in the world.
[3846.26 → 3848.72] So the third thing David says here in verse one,
[3849.44 → 3851.96] I do not concern myself with great matters
[3851.96 → 3853.66] or things too wonderful for me.
[3855.40 → 3857.46] So here David is talking about
[3857.46 → 3860.18] making a name for yourself
[3860.18 → 3863.66] as you're pursuing these great and marvellous things.
[3863.70 → 3866.10] Like, I want to do these amazing things.
[3866.10 → 3868.08] I'm going to do this
[3868.08 → 3869.56] and I'm going to be famous
[3869.56 → 3870.80] and other people are going to notice.
[3872.38 → 3873.68] Let's think about David.
[3873.90 → 3876.42] David was made king of Israel.
[3877.24 → 3879.50] But he didn't, how did he become king?
[3879.66 → 3882.08] He didn't become king by fighting,
[3882.52 → 3883.30] by striving,
[3883.78 → 3886.26] by taking out anybody who stood in his way.
[3886.80 → 3889.48] He didn't even aspire to be king,
[3889.72 → 3891.36] but God put him there.
[3892.30 → 3892.46] Right?
[3892.46 → 3893.82] David could have been,
[3894.02 → 3895.50] he could have been content
[3895.50 → 3897.92] to spend all of his days
[3897.92 → 3900.30] shepherding his father's flocks of sheep.
[3901.42 → 3904.28] If that is what God called him to do.
[3905.50 → 3907.40] But God appointed him
[3907.40 → 3908.82] to be king of Israel
[3908.82 → 3910.02] and he did it.
[3911.08 → 3912.24] So now the question is,
[3912.30 → 3913.04] well, how about you?
[3914.52 → 3916.04] When you think about your life
[3916.04 → 3917.38] and your place in life,
[3918.18 → 3919.50] when you think about the decisions
[3919.50 → 3921.86] that you make in your life
[3921.86 → 3923.50] about what you're going to do,
[3924.12 → 3926.20] are you trying to make a name for yourself?
[3927.10 → 3929.54] Or are you seeking to glorify God
[3929.54 → 3930.88] and live for God
[3930.88 → 3934.34] in whatever it is he calls you to do?
[3935.30 → 3935.52] Right?
[3935.60 → 3937.26] And when we are content with God,
[3937.30 → 3938.76] it means that we can live in this world
[3938.76 → 3939.78] with great freedom
[3939.78 → 3941.28] and great purpose
[3941.28 → 3943.10] and not be concerned
[3943.10 → 3945.50] with trying to gain happiness
[3945.50 → 3946.74] and contentment
[3946.74 → 3948.80] by scrambling to the top
[3948.80 → 3950.26] and doing great and marvellous things.
[3951.00 → 3952.70] Now God might make you king.
[3953.38 → 3953.76] Right?
[3953.96 → 3955.64] But whether he does or not,
[3955.76 → 3958.20] that's not what your heart needs
[3958.20 → 3959.50] because you're content.
[3960.60 → 3961.38] And then therefore,
[3961.46 → 3961.98] you can be content
[3961.98 → 3963.32] with whatever position
[3963.32 → 3964.24] God calls you to do.
[3964.32 → 3965.28] Whether it's a king
[3965.28 → 3965.92] or a shepherd
[3965.92 → 3966.76] or something else.
[3966.98 → 3968.10] Because this is what God
[3968.10 → 3968.92] has called you to do.
[3969.08 → 3970.32] And you can do it for his glory
[3970.32 → 3971.22] and with great purpose.
[3973.38 → 3974.56] Okay, so this is the second point
[3974.56 → 3975.96] we see here in Psalm 131.
[3976.06 → 3977.00] That when we're content
[3977.00 → 3978.26] in our relationship with God,
[3978.32 → 3979.56] when we're like this baby
[3979.56 → 3980.68] in his mother's arms,
[3980.76 → 3981.46] just content,
[3982.18 → 3983.78] not wanting what God can give us,
[3983.82 → 3985.80] but just having God himself,
[3986.20 → 3988.18] then it leads to this life
[3988.18 → 3989.68] of wholeness and peace,
[3990.24 → 3991.98] of being renewed in ourselves,
[3992.32 → 3993.82] of being reconciled
[3993.82 → 3995.24] to one another in relationship,
[3996.00 → 3997.80] and then being sent into the world
[3997.80 → 3999.32] to do the work
[3999.32 → 4000.48] that God has called us to do.
[4002.02 → 4002.98] Okay, and that leads us
[4002.98 → 4003.70] to our final thought
[4003.70 → 4004.22] for this morning.
[4004.42 → 4005.80] How do we get this contentment?
[4007.02 → 4007.38] Right?
[4007.44 → 4008.48] Because as we look at this,
[4008.54 → 4009.48] like, this is amazing.
[4009.58 → 4010.72] This is the Christian life.
[4011.26 → 4011.50] Right?
[4011.58 → 4012.98] Wouldn't this be great
[4012.98 → 4013.94] to be content?
[4014.36 → 4015.36] But as Spurgeon said,
[4015.54 → 4016.44] it's a lot easier
[4016.44 → 4017.32] to read than to do.
[4020.22 → 4021.86] How do we get this kind of contentment
[4021.86 → 4022.84] that David is talking about?
[4022.92 → 4024.34] And the answer is in verse 3.
[4024.34 → 4026.50] Verse 3 says,
[4026.62 → 4028.94] Oh Israel, hope in the Lord
[4028.94 → 4031.34] from this time forth and forevermore.
[4031.74 → 4032.16] That's it.
[4032.22 → 4032.70] That's the answer.
[4033.08 → 4033.90] Hope in the Lord.
[4035.12 → 4036.32] David is saying that we get
[4036.32 → 4037.62] this quietness of soul.
[4038.14 → 4039.46] We get this contentment
[4039.46 → 4041.46] when we put our hope in God.
[4042.34 → 4044.18] And the reason that we as Christians
[4044.18 → 4045.42] can hope in God
[4045.42 → 4048.12] is because we know the love
[4048.12 → 4051.04] that our Heavenly Father has for us.
[4051.68 → 4054.08] So I want to share this verse with you.
[4054.08 → 4057.28] How do we know God's love for us?
[4057.78 → 4059.86] A love that we experience
[4059.86 → 4060.70] that then causes us
[4060.70 → 4061.72] to put our hope in Him.
[4062.90 → 4065.92] This is Isaiah 49 verse 15.
[4066.24 → 4067.68] This is what the Lord says.
[4068.62 → 4071.52] Can a mother forget the baby at her breast
[4071.52 → 4072.86] and have no compassion
[4072.86 → 4074.16] on the child she has born?
[4075.74 → 4076.62] Rhetorical question.
[4077.16 → 4079.14] Not usually in a broken world sometimes,
[4079.26 → 4079.86] but not usually.
[4080.00 → 4080.98] Mothers generally love
[4080.98 → 4082.46] and care for their children.
[4082.46 → 4085.56] Though she may forget,
[4086.50 → 4088.78] I will not forget you.
[4089.78 → 4090.00] Right?
[4090.58 → 4092.10] It's an amazing verse.
[4092.44 → 4093.84] A mother nursing her child
[4093.84 → 4095.60] is one of the most intimate expressions
[4095.60 → 4097.94] of love and deep connection.
[4098.40 → 4099.10] And God says,
[4099.24 → 4100.14] just as intimate
[4100.14 → 4100.86] and as deep
[4100.86 → 4102.20] as that connection is,
[4102.88 → 4104.16] my love
[4104.16 → 4105.80] and my connection with you
[4105.80 → 4106.86] is deeper.
[4106.86 → 4109.86] How can we know that?
[4110.20 → 4111.40] How can we know that is true?
[4111.88 → 4113.22] The way we know that, friends,
[4113.28 → 4116.42] is that in God's great love for us,
[4116.56 → 4118.68] He sent His Son into the world.
[4119.14 → 4121.00] And as Jesus came into the world,
[4121.44 → 4122.60] He went to the cross.
[4123.42 → 4125.04] And what happened on the cross?
[4125.72 → 4126.60] On the cross,
[4127.00 → 4128.86] Jesus' soul became anguished
[4128.86 → 4129.60] anguished
[4129.60 → 4130.40] as He took
[4130.40 → 4131.80] our sin
[4131.80 → 4132.86] upon Himself.
[4133.82 → 4134.78] And He did so
[4134.78 → 4135.82] so that our souls
[4135.82 → 4136.38] can then
[4136.38 → 4138.08] be quieted
[4138.08 → 4139.10] with God's forgiveness.
[4139.88 → 4141.22] He became thirsty
[4141.22 → 4142.66] and He cried out,
[4143.40 → 4143.72] God,
[4143.96 → 4145.14] where are you?
[4145.90 → 4146.82] And He did that
[4146.82 → 4147.40] so that
[4147.40 → 4149.20] we could be filled.
[4149.80 → 4151.22] That we could be satisfied
[4151.22 → 4152.86] and not have to cry out to God
[4152.86 → 4154.12] and not be heard.
[4155.04 → 4155.32] Friends,
[4155.44 → 4157.08] Jesus came into our world,
[4157.08 → 4158.72] He took our cries,
[4158.96 → 4160.24] He took our restlessness
[4160.24 → 4161.78] upon Himself,
[4162.18 → 4163.98] and He died in our place
[4163.98 → 4165.08] on our behalf
[4165.08 → 4166.24] so that
[4166.24 → 4167.14] we could have
[4167.14 → 4167.86] this contentment
[4167.86 → 4168.54] that our hearts
[4168.54 → 4169.72] have always longed for.
[4170.68 → 4171.98] To have God
[4171.98 → 4173.08] as our Heavenly Father.
[4174.38 → 4176.06] And it is that truth
[4176.06 → 4177.54] that must hit home
[4177.54 → 4178.44] for you and me
[4178.44 → 4181.10] in order to have contentment.
[4181.46 → 4182.64] And when it does,
[4183.14 → 4183.94] when that truth
[4183.94 → 4184.54] hits home,
[4184.54 → 4185.18] hits home,
[4185.64 → 4186.36] what it does
[4186.36 → 4187.44] is it will calm
[4187.44 → 4188.92] and quiet your soul.
[4189.84 → 4191.62] Even when things around you
[4191.62 → 4192.64] are tumultuous
[4192.64 → 4193.24] and uncertain.
[4194.64 → 4195.66] So my prayer
[4195.66 → 4196.46] for you,
[4196.66 → 4197.26] for myself,
[4197.82 → 4198.90] is that we would know
[4198.90 → 4199.42] the love
[4199.42 → 4200.94] of our Heavenly Father.
[4201.26 → 4202.04] Our Heavenly Father
[4202.04 → 4202.92] who is committed
[4202.92 → 4204.92] to sustaining us,
[4205.06 → 4206.24] to loving us,
[4206.46 → 4207.64] to feeding us,
[4207.74 → 4209.24] to being with us
[4209.24 → 4210.08] all the days
[4210.08 → 4210.68] of our lives.
[4210.68 → 4211.92] until,
[4212.52 → 4213.74] with the pilgrims
[4213.74 → 4215.44] of old,
[4215.62 → 4216.24] we reach
[4216.24 → 4217.70] the new Jerusalem.
[4218.70 → 4219.82] Would you pray with me?
[4223.82 → 4224.94] Our Heavenly Father,
[4225.94 → 4228.28] we thank You
[4228.28 → 4229.38] that we can come before You
[4229.38 → 4230.38] not having to
[4230.38 → 4232.06] cry and demand
[4232.06 → 4234.02] because Your ear
[4234.02 → 4234.82] is already
[4234.82 → 4236.74] attentive to us.
[4236.74 → 4238.60] Your face
[4238.60 → 4239.34] is already
[4239.34 → 4242.00] toward us,
[4242.04 → 4242.70] Your eyes
[4242.70 → 4244.24] looking upon us.
[4245.68 → 4246.44] So Lord,
[4246.52 → 4247.54] knowing Your love,
[4248.48 → 4249.00] may we
[4249.00 → 4249.78] be content.
[4250.62 → 4251.22] May we have
[4251.22 → 4252.42] a quietness of soul
[4252.42 → 4254.40] that we see here
[4254.40 → 4255.32] in Psalm 131,
[4255.40 → 4256.10] even in the midst
[4256.10 → 4256.66] of a world
[4256.66 → 4258.98] that is tumultuous
[4258.98 → 4260.16] in so many ways.
[4260.16 → 4262.20] Lord,
[4262.28 → 4262.62] help us
[4262.62 → 4263.20] by Your Spirit
[4263.20 → 4263.80] to be that kind
[4263.80 → 4264.22] of person
[4264.22 → 4265.08] and then to have
[4265.08 → 4266.20] that contentment
[4266.20 → 4266.98] overflow
[4266.98 → 4267.90] out of our lives
[4267.90 → 4269.14] into the world
[4269.14 → 4270.14] You have made.
[4270.98 → 4272.42] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4273.00 → 4273.26] Amen.
[4277.12 → 4278.78] So let's rise
[4278.78 → 4279.48] and let's stand
[4279.48 → 4279.96] and let's sing
[4279.96 → 4280.68] our song of response
[4280.68 → 4281.02] together.
[4281.02 → 4281.12] Amen.
[4290.16 → 4308.58] My soul
[4308.58 → 4309.40] longs
[4309.40 → 4310.92] for the Lord
[4310.92 → 4313.30] in our weary
[4313.30 → 4314.68] land.
[4315.26 → 4316.42] Wells are dry
[4316.42 → 4318.48] and I am empty,
[4318.48 → 4320.22] only dust
[4320.22 → 4322.28] in my hands.
[4322.72 → 4324.30] How I yearn
[4324.30 → 4325.02] for streams
[4325.02 → 4325.90] of mercy
[4325.90 → 4327.98] where my soul
[4327.98 → 4329.86] can be restored.
[4330.44 → 4331.50] Come and drink,
[4331.66 → 4334.02] Jesus calls me
[4334.02 → 4335.94] and You will thirst
[4335.94 → 4337.52] no more.
[4337.52 → 4339.84] Oh, the fullness
[4339.84 → 4341.56] of Christ,
[4342.00 → 4343.24] Word of God,
[4343.34 → 4345.52] Word of life.
[4348.48 → 4352.62] How often
[4352.62 → 4354.86] in the stillness
[4354.86 → 4356.60] have I heard
[4356.60 → 4358.08] Your voice
[4358.08 → 4360.00] Every whisper,
[4360.52 → 4361.98] every promise
[4361.98 → 4363.48] caused my heart
[4363.48 → 4365.44] to rejoice
[4365.44 → 4367.84] In the quiet
[4367.84 → 4369.46] of the morning
[4369.46 → 4371.54] through the watches
[4371.54 → 4373.22] of the night
[4373.22 → 4374.94] In the fire
[4374.94 → 4377.02] of my struggles
[4377.02 → 4378.64] There's courage
[4378.64 → 4380.92] for the fight
[4380.92 → 4383.14] Oh, the power
[4383.14 → 4384.88] of Christ
[4384.88 → 4386.58] Word of God
[4386.58 → 4389.02] Word of life
[4389.02 → 4395.78] My soul
[4395.78 → 4396.60] longs
[4396.60 → 4397.98] to walk closer
[4397.98 → 4399.76] With the Lord
[4399.76 → 4401.02] I serve
[4401.76 → 4403.02] More than riches
[4403.02 → 4405.02] More than favour
[4405.02 → 4407.02] I delight
[4407.02 → 4409.40] in Your Word
[4409.40 → 4411.40] Turn my gaze
[4411.40 → 4413.28] from all that's worthless
[4413.28 → 4415.34] Set my heart
[4415.34 → 4417.24] on things above
[4417.24 → 4419.02] May my life
[4419.02 → 4421.02] tell Your goodness
[4421.02 → 4423.54] Your way of truth
[4423.54 → 4425.14] and love
[4425.14 → 4427.44] Oh, the wisdom
[4427.44 → 4429.20] of Christ
[4429.20 → 4430.82] Word of God
[4430.82 → 4433.20] Word of life
[4433.20 → 4433.82] Word of God
[4433.82 → 4434.20] Word of life
[4434.20 → 4440.54] My soul
[4440.54 → 4442.82] longs for the day
[4442.82 → 4444.82] I will see
[4444.82 → 4446.76] Your face
[4446.76 → 4448.50] In Your shout
[4448.50 → 4450.40] of jubilation
[4450.40 → 4452.26] No more tears
[4452.26 → 4454.38] death or pain
[4454.38 → 4456.38] Every word
[4456.38 → 4458.58] has accomplished
[4458.58 → 4460.54] Heaven sings
[4460.54 → 4462.40] and earth be cries
[4462.40 → 4464.18] To our God
[4464.18 → 4466.46] be the glory
[4466.46 → 4468.84] Let all creation
[4468.84 → 4470.34] cry
[4470.34 → 4472.76] Praise and honour
[4472.76 → 4474.50] to Christ
[4474.50 → 4476.42] Word of God
[4476.42 → 4480.14] Word of life
[4480.14 → 4483.60] May be seated
[4483.60 → 4504.12] Before we come to God in prayer
[4504.12 → 4505.60] we've got two announcements
[4505.60 → 4507.26] one is of joy
[4507.26 → 4508.34] and one is of lament
[4508.34 → 4510.20] So first I'd like to welcome
[4510.20 → 4510.98] Justin
[4510.98 → 4512.36] Mariyah
[4512.36 → 4513.96] one of our new immigrants
[4513.96 → 4515.10] from a few years back
[4515.10 → 4516.68] that we welcomed to Canada
[4516.68 → 4517.62] He and his mother
[4517.62 → 4518.68] had moved to Saskatoon
[4518.68 → 4519.56] last year
[4519.56 → 4520.70] and he's visiting us today
[4520.70 → 4522.48] and our second announcement
[4522.48 → 4524.74] is one of sorrow
[4524.74 → 4526.12] that Ali Hack lander
[4526.12 → 4527.16] was taken last night
[4527.16 → 4527.72] to hospital
[4527.72 → 4530.02] and so we'll be lifting her up
[4530.02 → 4530.62] to God
[4530.62 → 4531.38] in our prayer
[4531.38 → 4534.52] Please pray with me
[4534.52 → 4535.88] as we come to our Lord
[4535.88 → 4538.74] Almighty God
[4538.74 → 4540.30] author of creation
[4540.30 → 4542.94] you created our inmost beings
[4542.94 → 4544.56] you knit us together
[4544.56 → 4546.18] in our mother's wombs
[4546.18 → 4548.06] we praise you Lord
[4548.06 → 4549.52] because we are fearfully
[4549.52 → 4550.82] and wonderfully made
[4550.82 → 4552.60] you send the rivers
[4552.60 → 4553.34] into the valleys
[4553.34 → 4554.92] they flow between the mountains
[4554.92 → 4556.30] they give water
[4556.30 → 4557.38] to all animals
[4557.38 → 4558.14] of the field
[4558.14 → 4560.06] the wild donkeys drink
[4560.06 → 4561.64] until they are no longer thirsty
[4561.64 → 4563.20] the birds of the sky
[4563.20 → 4564.74] nest beside them
[4564.74 → 4566.02] they may sing
[4566.02 → 4567.22] in the branches
[4567.22 → 4568.78] your water
[4568.78 → 4570.84] your water from the mountains
[4570.84 → 4572.92] comes from your home above
[4572.92 → 4574.46] the land is filled
[4574.46 → 4576.10] with the fruit of your works
[4576.10 → 4578.34] we thank you Heavenly Father
[4578.34 → 4579.48] for this earth
[4579.48 → 4580.64] for Canada
[4580.64 → 4582.76] for this community in Ladder
[4582.76 → 4584.36] and for this congregation
[4584.36 → 4585.48] of believers
[4585.48 → 4587.46] it is our privilege
[4587.46 → 4588.80] to be called followers
[4588.80 → 4590.66] indeed children
[4590.66 → 4592.66] of the one true
[4592.66 → 4593.94] living God
[4593.94 → 4596.98] you sent your only-begotten son
[4596.98 → 4597.88] to die for us
[4597.88 → 4599.36] that we might live
[4599.36 → 4600.58] an eternal life
[4600.58 → 4601.40] through him
[4601.40 → 4602.80] and for him
[4602.80 → 4605.12] Lord we pray for this church
[4605.12 → 4606.80] guide our work
[4606.80 → 4608.00] through your Holy Spirit
[4608.00 → 4609.16] turn our hearts

[4612.88 → 4613.92] kindness
[4613.92 → 4615.12] generosity
[4615.12 → 4616.52] faithfulness
[4616.52 → 4617.44] gentleness
[4617.44 → 4618.76] and self-control
[4618.76 → 4620.68] give this congregation
[4620.68 → 4621.24] the courage
[4621.24 → 4621.74] and energy
[4621.74 → 4623.12] to magnify your name
[4623.12 → 4624.34] in this community
[4624.34 → 4624.90] of Ladder
[4624.90 → 4626.74] let your light shine
[4626.74 → 4627.72] and not be hidden
[4627.72 → 4628.48] under a basket
[4628.48 → 4629.78] not hidden
[4629.78 → 4630.86] under this building
[4630.86 → 4632.14] may we
[4632.14 → 4633.20] as your children
[4633.20 → 4634.02] be vessels
[4634.02 → 4634.70] of your goodness
[4634.70 → 4635.58] and channels
[4635.58 → 4636.32] of your peace
[4636.32 → 4638.08] you oh Lord
[4638.08 → 4638.98] are a God
[4638.98 → 4639.58] of goodness
[4639.58 → 4640.90] remind us
[4640.90 → 4641.68] of your sovereignty
[4641.68 → 4643.20] when the sinfulness
[4643.20 → 4644.04] of humanity
[4644.04 → 4645.36] darkens our hope
[4645.36 → 4646.96] by your grace
[4646.96 → 4648.68] deliver the afflicted
[4648.68 → 4650.00] from the hands of evil
[4650.00 → 4652.02] Lord of heaven and earth
[4652.02 → 4653.38] we pray for the leaders
[4653.38 → 4653.98] of the world
[4653.98 → 4655.38] as we head
[4655.38 → 4656.22] into an election
[4656.22 → 4657.62] we ask that our leaders
[4657.62 → 4658.20] in government
[4658.20 → 4659.44] not only in Canada
[4659.44 → 4660.44] but throughout the world
[4660.44 → 4661.62] always follow
[4661.62 → 4662.76] the side
[4662.76 → 4663.58] of compassion
[4663.58 → 4664.54] peace
[4664.54 → 4665.46] justice
[4665.46 → 4667.16] and forsake cruelty
[4667.16 → 4667.84] and bloodshed
[4667.84 → 4668.52] at every turn
[4668.52 → 4669.94] grant them wisdom
[4669.94 → 4670.80] and shrewdness
[4670.80 → 4672.34] but also cooperation
[4672.34 → 4673.86] and for those
[4673.86 → 4674.68] who strive in vain
[4674.68 → 4675.42] to become masters
[4675.42 → 4676.16] of your creation
[4676.16 → 4677.28] may their hearts
[4677.28 → 4677.82] be humbled
[4677.82 → 4678.74] and may they learn
[4678.74 → 4680.10] to seek your will
[4680.10 → 4681.30] before their own
[4681.30 → 4682.76] we thank you, Lord
[4682.76 → 4683.64] that Canada
[4683.64 → 4684.96] can be a welcoming nation
[4684.96 → 4686.92] Justin Radiator
[4686.92 → 4688.20] is a blessing to us
[4688.20 → 4689.42] and it is a testament
[4689.42 → 4690.82] of that welcoming spirit
[4690.82 → 4693.18] the world is large
[4693.18 → 4693.90] and the suffering
[4693.90 → 4694.76] can be overwhelming
[4694.76 → 4696.46] but our deepest sorrow
[4696.46 → 4697.60] often comes
[4697.60 → 4698.36] from right
[4698.36 → 4699.38] in our living room
[4699.38 → 4700.96] God of compassion
[4700.96 → 4701.96] be with those
[4701.96 → 4702.56] who are lonely
[4702.56 → 4703.44] depressed
[4703.44 → 4704.60] angry
[4704.60 → 4705.52] or frustrated
[4705.52 → 4706.18] with life
[4706.18 → 4707.74] these pains
[4707.74 → 4709.12] too often go unnoticed
[4709.12 → 4710.04] by the world
[4710.04 → 4711.58] but you know
[4711.58 → 4713.04] all our struggles
[4713.04 → 4714.70] bring comfort
[4714.70 → 4715.28] for those
[4715.28 → 4716.06] who are grieving
[4716.06 → 4716.56] the death
[4716.56 → 4717.22] of a friend
[4717.22 → 4718.24] or a family member
[4718.24 → 4719.70] whether this grief
[4719.70 → 4720.32] is recent
[4720.32 → 4721.60] and still raw
[4721.60 → 4723.38] or from many years ago
[4723.38 → 4725.18] maybe it's an anniversary
[4725.18 → 4725.58] Lord
[4725.58 → 4726.42] a birthday
[4726.42 → 4727.84] or just an evening
[4727.84 → 4728.80] that hasn't quite
[4728.80 → 4729.92] been the same since
[4729.92 → 4731.76] fill them with hope
[4731.76 → 4732.84] and encouragement
[4732.84 → 4734.98] you oh Lord
[4734.98 → 4736.24] are the great physician
[4736.24 → 4738.24] help us carry the burdens
[4738.24 → 4738.92] of sickness
[4738.92 → 4739.88] and old age
[4739.88 → 4742.32] many in
[4742.32 → 4743.84] and close to our congregation
[4743.84 → 4745.22] are dealing with serious
[4745.22 → 4746.24] and chronic illnesses
[4746.24 → 4747.94] we think in particular
[4747.94 → 4748.54] of Pat
[4748.54 → 4749.36] Joan

[4762.02 → 4763.08] and Henry
[4763.08 → 4764.90] and now we've just heard
[4764.90 → 4765.98] that Ali has been taken
[4765.98 → 4767.16] to hospital last night
[4767.16 → 4769.28] we pray for your comfort
[4769.28 → 4770.18] and healing
[4770.18 → 4770.54] Lord
[4770.54 → 4772.40] we ask you
[4772.40 → 4774.40] ease their daily pain
[4774.40 → 4776.02] and give them strength
[4776.02 → 4777.96] Spirit of Christ
[4777.96 → 4779.74] grant us an
[4779.74 → 4781.76] inextinguishable joy
[4781.76 → 4783.48] that outlasts
[4783.48 → 4784.16] our sorrows
[4784.16 → 4785.58] grant us hope
[4785.58 → 4786.36] that triumphs
[4786.36 → 4786.94] over despair
[4786.94 → 4788.36] and grant us
[4788.36 → 4789.18] a new belief
[4789.18 → 4790.32] that we have reason
[4790.32 → 4790.90] to rejoice
[4790.90 → 4792.62] because you made us
[4792.62 → 4794.22] and all we have
[4794.22 → 4795.50] is a gift from you
[4795.50 → 4796.66] Amen
[4796.66 → 4809.46] Would you please stand
[4809.46 → 4810.36] for the benediction
[4810.36 → 4811.88] and for our
[4811.88 → 4813.26] final song
[4813.26 → 4815.22] so I invite you
[4815.22 → 4817.58] to hold out your hands
[4817.58 → 4818.08] as a gesture
[4818.08 → 4819.04] of receiving the Lord's blessing
[4819.04 → 4819.80] it doesn't mean you're more
[4819.80 → 4820.56] spiritual or anything
[4820.56 → 4821.72] it's just
[4821.72 → 4823.14] it's just
[4823.14 → 4824.40] to bring our heart
[4824.40 → 4825.30] before the Lord
[4825.30 → 4829.06] may the God of peace
[4829.06 → 4829.74] who through the blood
[4829.74 → 4830.74] of the eternal covenant
[4830.74 → 4832.44] brought back from the dead
[4832.44 → 4833.32] our Lord Jesus
[4833.32 → 4834.58] that great shepherd
[4834.58 → 4835.18] of the sheep
[4835.18 → 4836.70] equip you
[4836.70 → 4837.58] with everything good
[4837.58 → 4838.74] for doing his will
[4838.74 → 4840.80] and may he work in us
[4840.80 → 4841.82] what is pleasing to him
[4841.82 → 4843.28] through Jesus Christ
[4843.28 → 4844.14] to whom be glory

[4851.88 → 4856.46] Amen
[4857.76 → 4858.50] savant lands
[4858.50 → 4888.48] Let's pray.
[4888.50 → 4893.50] The supper has ended, or now be extended.
[4894.08 → 4900.28] The fruits of this service in all who believe.
[4900.74 → 4907.22] The seed of Christ's teaching, receptors of preaching,
[4907.68 → 4914.14] shall blossom election for God and for all.
[4914.14 → 4921.34] Your grace shall incite us, your love shall unite us,
[4921.44 → 4928.28] to work for your kingdom and answer your call.
[4928.28 → 4935.78] With praise and thanksgiving to God ever living,
