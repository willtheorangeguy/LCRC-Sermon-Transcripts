[277.04 → 281.04] Good morning.
[281.04 → 287.04] Today is March 14, 3.14.
[287.04 → 289.04] For some people in the world, it's Pi Day.
[289.04 → 291.04] For us, it's the day that the Lord has made.
[291.04 → 293.04] Welcome.
[293.04 → 297.04] If you forgot about the time change, you're watching this later on.
[297.04 → 301.04] If you did change your clocks, you lost out on some sleep.
[301.04 → 307.04] So take another pull on that cup of coffee and let's wake up and worship the Lord this morning.
[307.04 → 309.04] I'm John Smit.
[309.04 → 315.04] With me are Gatlin on piano, Ashley, Jackie, and Asif away are our praise team this morning.
[315.04 → 329.04] Later on this morning, Pastor Jason will continue in this season of Lent and will open God's Word and bring a message from Romans 3.
[329.04 → 335.04] In several ways, he's answering the question over the last several weeks, why did Jesus die?
[335.04 → 341.04] The answer this week, to remove our judgment.
[341.04 → 344.04] We will also commemorate the Lord's suffer later on in this service.
[344.04 → 352.04] If you desire, have the bread and juice elements ready at your table for later on during this service.
[352.04 → 368.04] You've been inundated with news this weekend, and surely you probably have heard that we are at this one-year anniversary now of the shutdown of in-person church related to the COVID-19 restrictions.
[368.04 → 375.04] On March 15 last year, our church service was simply cancelled.
[375.04 → 382.04] The shutdown, the mandatory closure came on too soon for us to make any other organized plans.
[382.04 → 397.04] The following week, we started live-streaming services with older equipment and then after that, some pre-recorded services as newer equipment and software was sourced for streaming as we know it today.
[397.04 → 404.04] Let's hope we don't say the same thing a year from now.
[404.04 → 407.04] Today our offering is for Regent College.
[407.04 → 415.04] It's a graduate school of theology adjacent to UBC where evangelical faith is mated to rigorous academics.
[415.04 → 419.04] We're quite familiar with this college.
[419.04 → 426.04] Our pastor right now, Jason, is actually concluding a course of study there and very soon, in May,
[426.04 → 430.04] will attain his Master's of Theology degree from Regent College.
[430.04 → 442.04] Others in our congregation and others that we know have taken summer courses at Regent, and it's an organization well familiar to us and I encourage your offering to that cause this morning.
[442.04 → 459.04] Next week, the offering is for New Immigrant Support, another familiar support cause for this congregation, a fund that currently provides financial support for our two new immigrant families during their first year with us.
[459.04 → 473.04] Once again, I remind you, the single envelope that we're using this year allows us to specify several causes at once and to minimize, the result is minimizing the need for mailing or dropping off of your offerings.
[473.04 → 480.04] Once again, we thank you for your continuing and solid support.
[480.04 → 489.04] This morning, our call to worship is a short responsive reading, Psalm 51, verses 15 to 17.
[489.04 → 494.04] I'll begin, and you will read the bowl as usual along with me.
[494.04 → 501.04] Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise.
[501.04 → 505.04] You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[505.04 → 508.04] You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
[508.04 → 515.04] My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[515.04 → 518.04] You, God, will not despise.
[521.04 → 531.04] The Lord's greeting to us comes from Isaiah 43, verses 1 to 3, where God is speaking through Isaiah.
[531.04 → 536.04] He says, do not fear, for I have redeemed you.
[536.04 → 538.04] I have summoned you by name.
[538.04 → 539.04] You are mine.
[539.04 → 543.04] And then he says, in a metaphorical manner,
[543.04 → 546.04] when you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
[546.04 → 550.04] And when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[550.04 → 554.04] When you walk through fire, you will not be burned.
[554.04 → 557.04] The flames will not set you ablaze.
[557.04 → 562.04] For I am the Lord your God.
[562.04 → 567.04] Let's sing of these things as we begin several songs of praise,
[567.04 → 570.04] beginning with, Here I am to worship.
[570.04 → 575.04] Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[575.04 → 580.04] Open my eyes, let me see.
[580.04 → 581.04] Beauty that made this heart adore you.
[581.04 → 582.04] Hope of all life spent with you.
[582.04 → 583.04] So here I am to you.
[583.04 → 587.04] Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[587.04 → 592.04] Open my eyes, let me see.
[592.04 → 597.04] Beauty that made this heart adore you.
[597.04 → 601.04] Hope of all life spent with you.
[601.04 → 608.04] Hope of all life spent with you.
[608.04 → 613.04] So here I am to worship.
[613.04 → 616.04] Here I am to bow down.
[616.04 → 622.04] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[622.04 → 637.04] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[638.04 → 640.04] Take care of all greats.
[640.04 → 643.04] You're always feeling whole and выше worthy of paper.
[643.04 → 646.04] You're still מאוד� Beach in the heartfelt section.
[646.04 → 648.04] You're the next.
[648.04 → 654.04] glorious in heaven above
[654.04 → 661.90] humbly you came to the earth you created
[661.90 → 667.04] all for the sake became poor
[667.04 → 673.74] so here I am to worship
[673.74 → 677.40] here I am to bow down
[677.40 → 683.62] here I am to say that you're my God
[683.62 → 687.34] you're altogether lovely
[687.34 → 690.72] altogether worthy
[690.72 → 697.22] altogether wonderful to me
[697.22 → 701.76] and I'll never know
[701.76 → 705.20] how much it costs
[705.20 → 711.42] to see my sin on that cross
[711.42 → 715.14] I'll never know
[715.14 → 718.66] how much it costs
[718.66 → 721.98] to see my sin
[721.98 → 725.20] I'm on that cross
[725.20 → 731.42] so here I am to worship
[731.42 → 735.14] here I am to bow down
[735.14 → 741.42] here I am to say that you're my God
[741.42 → 744.36] you're altogether lovely
[744.36 → 747.64] altogether worthy
[747.64 → 751.36] altogether wonderful
[751.36 → 753.36] to me
[753.36 → 769.08] I cast my mind
[769.08 → 783.02] I cast my mind
[783.02 → 785.52] to Calvary
[785.52 → 788.30] where Jesus
[788.30 → 796.38] his брос Samuel
[796.46 → 798.24] his hands
[798.24 → 800.24] his feet
[800.24 → 800.30] my Saviour
[800.68 → 801.26] I
[801.26 → 806.26] He gave out on that cursed tree.
[810.26 → 816.26] His body bound and drenched in tears,
[817.26 → 823.26] They laid him down in Joseph's tomb,
[824.26 → 829.26] The entrance sealed by heavy stone.
[829.26 → 836.26] Messiah still and all alone.
[840.26 → 847.26] O praise the name of the Lord our God,
[848.26 → 853.26] O praise His name forevermore.
[853.26 → 860.26] For endless days we will sing Your praise,
[861.26 → 866.26] O Lord, O Lord our God.
[866.26 → 876.26] Then on the earth at break of dawn,
[877.26 → 882.26] The Son of Heaven rose again,
[882.26 → 889.26] O trap of death, where each door's sting,
[889.26 → 895.26] The angels roar for Christ their King.
[895.26 → 905.26] O praise the name of the Lord our God,
[905.26 → 910.26] O praise His name forevermore.
[910.26 → 920.26] For endless days we will sing Your praise,
[920.26 → 926.26] O Lord, O Lord our God.
[926.26 → 928.26] O praise for His name forever.
[929.26 → 932.26] O praise the name of the Lord our God,
[932.26 → 936.26] O Lord, O Lord our God,
[937.26 → 939.26] O Lord our God.
[939.26 → 943.26] Shall peace at night
[943.26 → 946.46] And I will rise
[946.46 → 949.26] My world is fixed
[949.26 → 952.26] Like it's transpired
[953.14 → 956.26] On Jesus' face
[958.78 → 963.26] O praise the name
[964.02 → 967.42] Of the Lord our God
[967.42 → 970.64] O praise His name
[970.64 → 973.42] Forevermore
[973.94 → 976.92] For in these days
[976.92 → 980.50] We will sing Your praise
[980.50 → 986.46] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[986.46 → 993.56] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[997.42 → 1005.64] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1005.64 → 1011.10] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1011.10 → 1015.64] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1015.64 → 1018.86] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1018.86 → 1020.86] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1020.86 → 1021.36] O Lord, O Lord of Your heart
[1021.36 → 1024.58] Nigh in awesome wonder
[1024.58 → 1032.58] Consider all the works Thy hands have made
[1032.58 → 1035.58] I see the stars
[1035.58 → 1040.80] I hear their roaring thunder
[1040.80 → 1046.80] The Father of the universe displayed
[1046.80 → 1050.02] And sings my soul
[1050.02 → 1051.02] And sings my soul
[1051.02 → 1055.02] My Saviour God to Thee
[1055.02 → 1058.02] How great Thou art
[1058.02 → 1062.02] How great Thou art
[1062.02 → 1070.24] How great Thou art
[1070.24 → 1074.24] How great Thou art
[1074.24 → 1078.46] How great Thou art
[1078.46 → 1081.46] But when I think
[1081.46 → 1084.66] That God His Son
[1084.66 → 1086.22] Not sparing
[1086.22 → 1089.76] Sent Him to die
[1089.76 → 1093.58] But scarce can't take it in
[1093.58 → 1096.88] That on the cross
[1096.88 → 1101.10] My burden gladly bearing
[1101.10 → 1103.10] In heaven and earth
[1103.10 → 1105.10] To take away
[1105.10 → 1107.10] My sin
[1107.10 → 1111.10] Then sings my soul
[1111.10 → 1115.10] My Saviour God to Thee
[1115.10 → 1119.10] How great Thou art
[1119.10 → 1123.10] How great Thou art
[1123.10 → 1126.32] And sings my soul
[1126.32 → 1131.10] My Saviour God to Thee
[1131.10 → 1134.48] How great Thou art
[1134.48 → 1134.54] How great Thou art
[1134.54 → 1138.48] How great Thou art
[1138.48 → 1142.54] When Christ shall come
[1142.54 → 1146.74] With shouts of acclamation
[1146.74 → 1150.62] And take me home
[1150.62 → 1154.54] While joy shall fill my heart
[1154.54 → 1157.84] Then I shall bow
[1157.84 → 1162.50] In humble adoration
[1162.50 → 1165.42] And there proclaim
[1165.42 → 1170.30] My God how great Thou art
[1170.30 → 1173.84] Then sings my soul
[1173.84 → 1178.62] My Saviour God to Thee
[1178.62 → 1182.90] How great Thou art
[1182.90 → 1185.62] How great Thou art
[1185.62 → 1187.50] How great Thou art
[1187.50 → 1189.36] Dan sings my soul
[1189.36 → 1190.38] My Saviour God to Thee
[1190.38 → 1195.08] How great Thou art
[1195.08 → 1197.42] How great Thou art
[1197.42 → 1198.70] How great Thou art
[1198.70 → 1202.84] How great Thou art
[1202.84 → 1204.84] Thou art
[1204.84 → 1205.84] How great Thou art
[1205.84 → 1219.66] In our time of confession and assurance
[1219.66 → 1224.54] I have selected a responsive prayer of confession
[1224.54 → 1228.44] It's inspired by James 1 verses 17 to 27
[1228.44 → 1232.28] And is adapted from words written by Maya Le idol
[1232.28 → 1238.20] Join me in this prayer of confession
[1238.20 → 1244.10] When the busyness of our lives erodes the intentions of our hearts
[1244.10 → 1246.92] Merciful God forgive us
[1246.92 → 1253.46] When our personal agendas take precedence over reaching out to others
[1253.46 → 1257.08] Merciful God forgive us
[1257.08 → 1262.44] When we keep putting off being more active doers of the word
[1262.44 → 1266.32] Merciful God forgive us
[1266.32 → 1273.98] When we resist change knowing that our acting and thinking are limited by our prejudice and ignorance
[1273.98 → 1277.30] Merciful God forgive us
[1277.30 → 1282.66] When we only half listen to those who cry out to be fully heard
[1282.66 → 1286.14] Merciful God forgive us
[1286.14 → 1291.88] Gracious and merciful God forgive us for past faults
[1291.88 → 1294.64] And help us in the present and future
[1294.64 → 1299.06] To make ourselves more available to the hurting world that surrounds us
[1299.06 → 1302.02] The world that begins on our doorsteps
[1302.02 → 1307.06] Equip us to be patient and compassionate listeners
[1307.06 → 1311.34] Proclaiming the gospel not in overbearing ways
[1311.34 → 1313.92] But sensitively and lovingly
[1313.92 → 1317.54] Encourage us to be patient
[1317.54 → 1320.18] In waiting for the time when we can meet
[1320.18 → 1322.34] Together again
[1322.34 → 1323.30] To praise you
[1323.30 → 1325.28] And faithful as a congregation
[1325.28 → 1328.54] While often being very separated from each other
[1328.54 → 1332.26] Strengthen us with the Holy Spirit
[1332.26 → 1334.68] To be fruitful and active witnesses
[1334.68 → 1338.36] To Jesus in all we do and say
[1338.36 → 1342.74] Our assurance of forgiveness
[1342.74 → 1344.96] And this comes from Philippians 2 verses 6 to 8
[1344.96 → 1345.94] Familiar words
[1345.94 → 1347.00] Hear the good news
[1347.00 → 1350.52] Jesus though he was in form of God
[1350.52 → 1353.08] Did not count equality with God
[1353.08 → 1354.90] As something to be exploited
[1354.90 → 1357.04] But emptied himself
[1357.04 → 1358.62] Taking the form of a slave
[1358.62 → 1361.76] And became obedient to the point of death
[1361.76 → 1363.30] Even death on a cross
[1363.30 → 1365.36] Through his obedience
[1365.36 → 1367.18] We are therefore freed
[1367.18 → 1368.90] From whatever sin
[1368.90 → 1370.12] Enslaves us
[1370.12 → 1372.24] Thanks be to God
[1372.24 → 1375.16] Our song of response is
[1375.16 → 1375.88] Living Hope
[1375.88 → 1395.58] How great the chasm
[1395.58 → 1399.68] That lay between us
[1399.68 → 1402.30] How high the mountain
[1402.30 → 1406.02] I could not climb
[1406.02 → 1409.06] In desperation
[1409.06 → 1412.68] I turned to heaven
[1412.68 → 1416.02] And spoke your name
[1416.02 → 1420.02] Into the night
[1420.02 → 1422.98] Than through the darkness
[1422.98 → 1425.98] Your loving kindness
[1425.98 → 1427.02] Your loving kindness
[1427.02 → 1430.10] Tore through the shadows
[1430.10 → 1433.12] Of my soul
[1433.12 → 1437.24] The work is finished
[1437.24 → 1440.18] The end is written
[1440.18 → 1443.38] Jesus Christ
[1443.38 → 1446.98] My living hope
[1446.98 → 1453.74] Who could imagine
[1453.74 → 1457.18] So great a mercy
[1457.18 → 1461.10] What heart could fathom
[1461.10 → 1464.10] Such boundless grace
[1464.10 → 1467.36] The God of ages
[1467.36 → 1470.82] Step down from glory
[1470.82 → 1473.82] To wear my sin
[1473.82 → 1473.94] To wear my sin
[1473.94 → 1477.58] And bear my shame
[1477.58 → 1480.94] The cross has spoken
[1480.94 → 1484.30] I am forgiven
[1484.30 → 1486.94] The King of kings
[1486.94 → 1490.94] Calls me his own
[1490.94 → 1494.70] Beautiful Saviour
[1494.70 → 1497.86] I'm yours forever
[1497.86 → 1501.24] Jesus Christ
[1501.24 → 1504.60] My living hope
[1504.60 → 1507.26] Hallelujah
[1507.26 → 1509.14] Hallelujah
[1509.14 → 1510.98] Praise the one
[1510.98 → 1512.70] Who set me free
[1512.70 → 1514.14] Hallelujah
[1514.14 → 1518.60] Death has lost its grip
[1518.60 → 1519.44] On me
[1519.44 → 1521.28] You have broken
[1521.28 → 1522.98] Every chain
[1522.98 → 1524.72] There's salvation
[1524.72 → 1526.40] In your name
[1526.40 → 1528.50] Jesus Christ
[1528.50 → 1531.84] My living hope
[1531.84 → 1545.70] Then came the morning
[1545.70 → 1549.78] That sealed the promise
[1549.78 → 1552.60] Your buried body
[1552.60 → 1556.52] Began to breathe
[1556.52 → 1559.90] Out of the silence
[1559.90 → 1562.90] The roaring lion
[1562.90 → 1565.86] Declared the grave
[1565.86 → 1569.76] Has no claim on me
[1569.76 → 1573.12] Then came the morning
[1573.12 → 1576.38] That sealed the promise
[1576.38 → 1579.94] Your buried body
[1579.94 → 1583.76] Began to breathe
[1583.76 → 1587.12] Out of the silence
[1587.12 → 1590.12] The roaring lion
[1590.12 → 1592.96] Declared the grave
[1592.96 → 1596.98] Has no claim on me
[1596.98 → 1602.92] Jesus, yours is the victory
[1602.92 → 1606.12] Hallelujah
[1606.12 → 1611.78] Praise the one who set me free
[1611.78 → 1613.12] Hallelujah
[1613.12 → 1615.12] Hallelujah
[1615.12 → 1617.70] Death has lost its grip
[1617.70 → 1618.58] On me
[1618.58 → 1620.38] You have broken
[1620.38 → 1622.04] Every chain
[1622.04 → 1623.40] There's salvation
[1623.40 → 1625.48] In your name
[1625.48 → 1627.56] Jesus Christ
[1627.56 → 1631.88] My living hope
[1631.88 → 1633.76] Hallelujah
[1633.76 → 1637.38] Praise the one
[1637.38 → 1639.06] Who set me free
[1639.06 → 1640.12] Hallelujah
[1640.12 → 1661.12] Day Salem
[1661.12 → 1672.74] my living hope. God, you are my living hope.
[1672.74 → 1674.74] Amen.
[1702.74 → 1715.24] We are spending this season of Lent as a church looking at various aspects of the cross of Christ,
[1715.84 → 1724.22] trying to see what it means that because of Jesus' death, we have atonement at one meant with God.
[1724.66 → 1729.38] And today the text we're going to be looking at is a beautiful text.
[1729.38 → 1736.34] It is so central to all that it is that we believe and that we hold on to as Christians.
[1736.90 → 1741.94] So we're going to be looking at Romans chapter 3, verses 21 to 26.
[1742.46 → 1748.10] And this is the great message of righteousness that comes by faith.
[1748.20 → 1749.74] This is the gospel.
[1750.66 → 1757.22] So I will read for us Romans 3, again, verses 21 to 26.
[1759.38 → 1766.76] But now apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the law and the prophets testify.
[1767.64 → 1771.72] This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
[1772.38 → 1778.60] There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[1778.60 → 1786.58] And all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
[1787.44 → 1795.34] God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of his blood to be received by faith.
[1796.00 → 1803.92] He did this to demonstrate his righteousness because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[1803.92 → 1815.28] He did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time to be just in the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
[1816.64 → 1819.30] This is God's word to us this morning.
[1819.88 → 1821.22] So let's pray as we begin.
[1821.22 → 1828.46] Father, again, we ask that you would come to us.
[1829.76 → 1834.70] As this passage tells us, we are dead in our sin.
[1834.84 → 1837.22] We are not able to save ourselves.
[1837.42 → 1841.84] We are not able to rouse our hearts to seek you, to find you.
[1841.84 → 1847.16] But because of your love and your grace, you came down to us.
[1847.24 → 1853.76] You intervened into our world, our situation, in order to lift us up to you.
[1854.30 → 1860.84] Lord, lift us up to you this morning, again, as we open your inspired and infallible word.
[1861.14 → 1862.88] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1865.00 → 1869.94] So this passage basically is about something that has been freely given to us.
[1869.94 → 1870.54] A gift.
[1870.54 → 1870.64] A gift.
[1871.62 → 1879.76] In each of the passages we're looking at in this series, in some sense, describe the gift of the cross from a different angle.
[1880.70 → 1889.74] But as we think about the way that Romans 3 describes it here, as I was thinking about it, what comes to mind for me is the backhanded compliment.
[1890.88 → 1892.34] You have probably received one.
[1892.68 → 1895.32] You may even have offered one yourself.
[1895.96 → 1899.72] Like, you know, your haircut really slims your face.
[1900.54 → 1902.76] And it's like, thanks?
[1903.56 → 1904.22] I guess.
[1905.10 → 1905.30] Right?
[1905.36 → 1908.28] It's kind of a compliment that's an affirmation.
[1908.64 → 1913.10] And yet, there's kind of an implied criticism on the back end.
[1913.10 → 1923.64] And it's not just compliments or things that we might say about someone, but gifts can actually kind of have this implied bite.
[1923.64 → 1933.68] So, once in a while, I like to watch the very funny Canadian sitcom called Schitt's Creek.
[1933.68 → 1939.60] So, Friday night, I was watching it, and it fit this sermon perfectly for this example.
[1940.24 → 1948.26] So, the show, if you don't know, it's about a wealthy family who has lost all their wealth, and they're going and living and trying to make a new life in a small town.
[1948.26 → 1952.22] And they end up living in a motel in the town.
[1952.36 → 1956.26] And so, the husband of the family, Johnny, ends up working at the motel.
[1957.02 → 1960.40] And the only other employee is a young woman named Stevie.
[1961.38 → 1964.50] And so, there are only two employees at the motel.
[1964.50 → 1971.88] But in this one episode, Johnny gives Stevie a gift for being employee of the month, which is, you know, just ridiculous.
[1972.00 → 1972.82] There's only two employees.
[1973.36 → 1974.98] So, he gave it to himself the previous month.
[1975.92 → 1981.02] And the gift, though, to Stevie is this big suitcase of makeup.
[1982.36 → 1984.18] But the thing is, Stevie never wears makeup.
[1985.08 → 1988.38] Her style is kind of like jeans, a t-shirt, a flannel shirt.
[1988.38 → 1992.62] And so, she's also kind of upset about this gift.
[1992.70 → 1996.78] And she's like, what's he trying to say here, giving me all this makeup?
[1997.62 → 1999.92] It's kind of like a backhanded gift.
[2000.58 → 2006.56] And so, to make her point, she puts on the makeup and just goes way over the top with it.
[2006.78 → 2010.64] She puts on this, like, deep purple eyeshadow.
[2010.94 → 2012.36] I mean, I don't know all the names for this stuff.
[2012.50 → 2016.24] But, like, makeup and stuff on her cheek, all that.
[2016.24 → 2019.28] But, and she comes out.
[2019.36 → 2025.10] She's like, okay, I'll work behind the reception desk and meet all the guests.
[2025.90 → 2029.42] And, of course, Johnny is horrified and realizes his mistake.
[2030.24 → 2032.80] And he admits it wasn't a very good gift.
[2033.34 → 2035.38] But he didn't mean it to be backhanded.
[2036.92 → 2041.10] Now, the reason I'm sharing this story with you is that as we look at the cross,
[2041.10 → 2044.42] it not only shows us something that God wants us to have,
[2044.42 → 2047.88] and that God wants to be for us,
[2048.30 → 2054.84] it's kind of like a backhanded gift because it says something about what we need.
[2055.32 → 2057.64] It says something about who we are.
[2058.88 → 2065.50] And today, as we consider what it means from this passage that Jesus turns away God's judgment,
[2065.50 → 2073.16] we've got to accept first that this tells us something about ourselves and our condition.
[2074.92 → 2077.66] And I think the first thing, as we go through this passage,
[2077.76 → 2083.02] the first thing it alerts us to is the problem of our sin against God.
[2083.18 → 2086.08] So that's our first point, our need.
[2086.08 → 2092.44] We see this most obviously in verse 23, which says,
[2093.40 → 2097.92] For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[2098.70 → 2104.00] And there are really two things that are really important that Paul says to us here.
[2104.12 → 2106.82] First, he's talking about the scope of the problem.
[2107.30 → 2107.86] He says,
[2107.86 → 2109.54] All have sinned.
[2110.32 → 2112.24] Okay, and so we're in Romans chapter 3.
[2112.34 → 2116.92] In Romans chapter 1 and 2, he's talking about Jews and Gentiles.
[2117.10 → 2121.82] People with different cultures, different ways of living, different religious systems.
[2122.42 → 2128.86] But all of that is merely superficial because all have sinned.
[2129.86 → 2130.04] Right?
[2130.04 → 2136.24] Jew and Gentile, religious, irreligious, those who have known God's law.
[2136.24 → 2145.64] And those who have been far away from God and who haven't known his law, equally all have sinned.
[2147.04 → 2151.32] And that, of course, causes this question that Paul is addressing in Romans 3,
[2151.46 → 2154.62] which is, you know, the Jews are asking,
[2154.88 → 2159.06] Wait, isn't somebody special in some way?
[2159.92 → 2160.06] Right?
[2160.12 → 2162.92] Isn't there something unique about God's chosen people?
[2162.92 → 2168.14] And Paul is making the point over and over again that no,
[2168.74 → 2174.66] not one person stands before God having been in a life that is righteous.
[2175.74 → 2177.70] And so that is the scope of the problem.
[2177.84 → 2181.72] It's declaring the universal sinfulness of humankind.
[2182.84 → 2186.66] And the second thing that Paul shows us is the depth of the problem.
[2186.78 → 2187.18] He says,
[2187.18 → 2195.10] The glory of God here is the standard by which we are measured.
[2195.62 → 2200.82] God's perfect, holy, glorious righteousness is the standard.
[2201.58 → 2208.72] And this has much more to do then with our condition than any act of sin or action that we perform.
[2208.90 → 2210.68] Because no one meets the standard.
[2210.68 → 2214.18] Now, you may say,
[2215.00 → 2215.66] I object.
[2217.08 → 2219.44] I know some really nice people.
[2220.06 → 2223.42] I myself am a really nice person.
[2224.12 → 2225.20] So how can this be?
[2225.38 → 2227.16] How can this be?
[2227.24 → 2231.24] Because most people, it seems, are fairly good.
[2231.24 → 2237.42] But Paul is saying here that being fairly good is not the standard.
[2238.02 → 2244.44] The standard is not, you know, kind of being more or less a good person when you kind of average it all out.
[2244.84 → 2248.60] The standard is absolute and complete perfection.
[2248.60 → 2263.86] So meeting the standard of God's own glory means that at no time in your entire life have you ever even slightly broken a single command of God.
[2264.16 → 2268.50] A single sense of what God says is right and good.
[2269.56 → 2273.08] It means also that you've never even thought to do it.
[2273.08 → 2283.42] And while you are doing good, you always and only do it for God's good pleasure and delight and not at all for any sort of selfish motivation.
[2284.44 → 2285.48] That's the standard.
[2286.06 → 2288.24] Absolute perfection in all ways.
[2288.96 → 2289.06] Right?
[2289.18 → 2290.20] Complete holiness.
[2290.40 → 2291.24] Complete righteousness.
[2292.24 → 2297.60] So now, given that standard, let's look back and think about yourself.
[2297.60 → 2304.04] And you might say, well, okay, you know, I've slipped up once or twice.
[2304.80 → 2306.58] But no, that's not right either.
[2307.28 → 2307.42] Right?
[2307.54 → 2311.46] Once we have sinned, even once, we come up short.
[2311.70 → 2315.16] We don't attain to the glory of God.
[2316.14 → 2323.74] And therefore, in God's eyes, in the eyes of the perfect and glorious creator of all things, you've rebelled against him.
[2324.50 → 2325.88] You've broken his law.
[2325.88 → 2334.64] And that's why, friends, that we don't measure sin by how bad we are, but by how good we are not.
[2335.72 → 2338.40] So Paul says, all have sinned.
[2338.96 → 2343.18] We are what Eugene Peterson calls a string of zeros.
[2344.34 → 2346.90] We fail to rise to the character of God.
[2346.90 → 2356.40] And that means that each one of us has a bottomless need for grace because we have fallen short.
[2357.36 → 2361.40] This is what the Reformation has called total depravity.
[2362.56 → 2369.86] You know, and it doesn't mean that everything you do is totally bad or that everything you do is as bad as it could be.
[2369.86 → 2375.14] It's just that every arena of human existence has been polluted by sin.
[2375.22 → 2376.60] Every area of life.
[2377.22 → 2382.04] And as a result, no human being does any good that merits salvation.
[2382.04 → 2392.36] You know, and I think any honest evaluation of our lives tells us that our lives are marked by a mixture of good and bad.
[2392.36 → 2397.46] Even the good things we do are often done for selfish reasons.
[2398.30 → 2403.66] And so, in fact, we are bound by sin even more than we often believe.
[2403.66 → 2410.06] So Paul here insists that no matter who you are or what your life is like,
[2410.56 → 2416.72] each one of us has an ultimate, deep, and eternal issue.
[2416.96 → 2419.46] That we've all fallen short of the glory of God.
[2420.24 → 2424.72] For all of us, our unrighteousness before God is our biggest problem.
[2425.08 → 2430.72] And we can think, you know, I don't deny my unrighteousness, but I've got other problems.
[2430.72 → 2432.42] You know, maybe I'm sick.
[2433.10 → 2434.72] Maybe I have financial difficulties.
[2435.48 → 2437.64] Maybe I have, you know, relational difficulties.
[2437.74 → 2440.02] And the Bible doesn't diminish that.
[2440.14 → 2443.40] It doesn't say everything in life boils down to sin.
[2444.26 → 2450.58] But it does identify and insist that our deepest problem is still our sin.
[2452.18 → 2457.88] And so, friends, that means that before the cross makes sense to us at all,
[2457.88 → 2466.36] if you have any sense that somebody somewhere has an ability to earn God's favour
[2466.36 → 2469.18] or is able to be in a relationship with God,
[2469.24 → 2471.20] then the cross will never make any sense to you.
[2472.20 → 2476.54] But God wants us to rightly understand our deepest need
[2476.54 → 2480.16] so that it might then be met in Jesus.
[2481.30 → 2484.74] And that's the second thing that I think this passage points to.
[2484.74 → 2489.78] After we've seen that our deepest problem is our sin against God,
[2489.86 → 2493.62] we then learn the good news of God's gift of grace.
[2494.90 → 2500.42] And so we look at verses then going forward on 24, verses 24 and 25,
[2500.68 → 2502.12] which speak most directly to this.
[2502.82 → 2503.08] It says,
[2503.08 → 2529.48] And so just as God wants to teach you that your deepest need here is your sin,
[2529.48 → 2534.12] God here is also giving us this language and these words
[2534.12 → 2537.54] to help us understand what can meet that need.
[2538.66 → 2541.76] And so there are five really important words that Paul uses here,
[2541.80 → 2544.86] and I think it is worth pausing over each of them
[2544.86 → 2547.74] to see what Jesus has accomplished for us on the cross.
[2548.80 → 2551.16] So I'd like us to go through each of these words.
[2551.22 → 2553.78] And the first word is justified.
[2553.78 → 2559.88] Justified means that we have been declared righteous.
[2560.32 → 2560.56] Right?
[2560.62 → 2563.06] We are declared righteous, not made righteous.
[2563.76 → 2568.46] And so in Christ, this is a declaration over our lives
[2568.46 → 2572.96] that God looks upon us, and he names us as those who have not sinned.
[2573.70 → 2577.68] That those who have actually not fallen short of his glory.
[2577.98 → 2578.84] And that's amazing.
[2578.84 → 2584.30] And it's the idea that we now are seen as living in accord with God's laws.
[2585.40 → 2588.66] That living in a sense the way that he has made us to live
[2588.66 → 2594.74] in a way that befits the kind of creatures that we are before a holy God.
[2596.02 → 2599.86] And God declares us righteous in Christ.
[2600.48 → 2604.02] So that means not only are we declared to be innocent of sin,
[2604.02 → 2609.60] even more than that, we have received Jesus' perfect righteousness.
[2610.42 → 2612.36] It's been credited to our account.
[2613.52 → 2614.54] So we are justified.
[2614.78 → 2616.82] We are declared righteous before God.
[2617.76 → 2623.28] And we learn, secondly, that Christ's death on the cross has redeeming power.
[2625.68 → 2628.22] And so here Paul is mixing metaphors.
[2628.96 → 2629.18] Right?
[2629.26 → 2631.96] Because being justified is a word from the courtroom.
[2631.96 → 2635.54] The judge declares you not only not guilty,
[2636.30 → 2639.56] but further to be upstanding and righteous.
[2640.76 → 2644.46] And then this verdict that we receive sets us free.
[2644.98 → 2647.36] We are no longer bound by sin and guilt.
[2648.24 → 2650.58] That's this language of redemption that's used.
[2650.66 → 2652.86] That we are, in fact, redeemed in Christ.
[2653.30 → 2655.30] We're not enslaved to a guilty conscience.
[2655.70 → 2660.28] We're not enslaved or bound to death and sin and the devil.
[2660.28 → 2662.92] But now we belong to God.
[2662.98 → 2664.64] We've been set free and purchased.
[2665.76 → 2669.58] And now we belong to God, who is our Heavenly Father.
[2670.84 → 2678.34] And one of the most iconic images of the White House in the Oval Office
[2678.34 → 2684.88] is of little JFK Jr., where his father is the president there.
[2684.88 → 2691.52] And at what is arguably the most important and powerful desk in the entire world,
[2692.30 → 2693.76] here is this little child.
[2693.84 → 2698.90] He's just kind of crawling around the desk, hanging out with Dad, the president.
[2698.90 → 2705.08] And it's this amazing image of the assurance and the boldness that we have as children of God
[2705.08 → 2707.16] to be in God's presence.
[2707.58 → 2711.40] To be in the presence of the creator of the universe, the powerful one.
[2711.88 → 2713.18] But we can be with him.
[2713.24 → 2717.10] We can be free because we are seen as righteous in his sight.
[2717.18 → 2720.92] We are loved, and we are beloved to him.
[2721.58 → 2723.54] So friends, there's great freedom in that.
[2723.54 → 2729.72] We see, though, third, that this gift is a gift of grace.
[2731.78 → 2738.46] And the beauty of grace is that it puts all of us on the same playing field.
[2740.20 → 2743.72] You know, and so you might meet some people in your life that,
[2744.18 → 2750.76] where their lives on the surface seem maybe more morally upright than others.
[2750.76 → 2758.56] But unless their lives are defined by a deep dependence upon Jesus as the only way,
[2759.26 → 2764.04] and that there's a recognition that nothing can be added to the total and perfect work on the cross,
[2764.44 → 2765.50] then it's meaningless.
[2766.50 → 2769.72] Because our salvation is not received by what we have done,
[2770.34 → 2772.52] but by what Jesus has done for us.
[2772.52 → 2776.16] And in that way, the playing field has been levelled.
[2776.18 → 2777.88] And this is why grace is so outrageous.
[2778.44 → 2781.08] It's so against every other religious system,
[2781.34 → 2783.16] what we naturally believe as people,
[2783.28 → 2785.18] because it is completely unfair.
[2785.94 → 2788.70] Because it's not based on our performance.
[2789.96 → 2793.38] Grace means complete unmerited favour.
[2793.98 → 2795.18] Nobody deserves it.
[2795.96 → 2798.30] Nobody matches up to God's standard.
[2798.40 → 2801.46] We all fall short in one way or another.
[2801.46 → 2805.24] And so grace is something that has to come to us from the outside.
[2806.10 → 2807.90] And Paul, again and again,
[2808.42 → 2812.04] uses this language of being in Christ,
[2812.58 → 2814.38] of this grace being in Christ,
[2814.70 → 2815.84] and not in ourselves.
[2816.78 → 2819.98] So he'll go on in chapter 5,
[2820.06 → 2821.38] just two chapters after this,
[2821.68 → 2823.46] and he's going to say it in three different ways.
[2823.56 → 2824.64] So I want to share these with you.
[2825.32 → 2826.06] He'll say,
[2826.06 → 2829.20] when we were still powerless,
[2830.14 → 2831.72] Christ died for the ungodly.
[2832.62 → 2834.70] While we were still sinners,
[2835.52 → 2836.92] Christ died for us.
[2837.60 → 2839.78] While we were God's enemies,
[2840.48 → 2842.30] we were reconciled to him
[2842.30 → 2844.24] through the death of his son.
[2845.34 → 2845.54] Right?
[2845.54 → 2845.96] So friends,
[2846.06 → 2847.18] while we were unjust,
[2848.06 → 2850.04] while we were ourselves,
[2850.22 → 2850.68] sinners,
[2851.50 → 2852.68] bound by sin,
[2853.62 → 2855.54] unable to save ourselves,
[2855.86 → 2858.12] in rebellion against our creator,
[2858.72 → 2861.38] God reconciled us to himself.
[2861.86 → 2863.54] He intervened in our situation.
[2864.04 → 2866.32] He did everything to bring us to himself
[2866.32 → 2867.20] by his grace.
[2867.20 → 2869.32] And he does that, friends,
[2869.46 → 2872.20] not after we've gotten our acts together,
[2872.30 → 2874.42] not after we're willing to confess,
[2874.76 → 2876.12] because we're not able to do that
[2876.12 → 2877.04] to merit God's favour,
[2877.34 → 2879.88] but he does it only in his own mercy.
[2881.06 → 2881.88] That's grace.
[2883.50 → 2885.36] Paul gives us, next,
[2886.54 → 2888.62] a fourth word that tells us
[2888.62 → 2892.48] that this grace we receive at great cost.
[2893.42 → 2896.04] Because a fourth word is a really strange word
[2896.04 → 2897.84] that you never otherwise use.
[2897.90 → 2898.76] It's the word atonement.
[2901.44 → 2903.82] Atonement literally refers, again,
[2904.00 → 2906.40] to the place in the Holy of Holies
[2906.40 → 2906.92] in the temple
[2906.92 → 2909.58] where blood from a sacrificial animal
[2909.58 → 2911.46] would be poured out
[2911.46 → 2912.74] on the day of atonement.
[2913.72 → 2914.92] It's the place
[2914.92 → 2917.58] where God's wrath and anger
[2917.58 → 2919.90] at his people's sin
[2919.90 → 2921.76] once a year
[2921.76 → 2923.18] would be satisfied.
[2923.18 → 2926.20] It would be poured out there
[2926.20 → 2927.46] in the Holy of Holies
[2927.46 → 2929.88] so that it wouldn't have to be poured out
[2929.88 → 2931.24] on his people.
[2931.98 → 2933.80] And what we are told here
[2933.80 → 2935.44] is that Jesus is
[2935.44 → 2937.62] that atonement for his people.
[2938.46 → 2939.90] God directs, and he funnels
[2939.90 → 2941.82] all of his just and righteous
[2941.82 → 2943.76] opposition to sin,
[2943.90 → 2945.30] his holy opposition
[2945.30 → 2947.12] to everything that is wicked
[2947.12 → 2948.74] and evil and destructive
[2948.74 → 2949.74] in the world
[2949.74 → 2951.74] that we deserve
[2951.74 → 2952.74] because we are the ones
[2952.74 → 2953.28] who are guilty.
[2953.42 → 2954.46] He pours all of that
[2954.46 → 2955.86] onto his son.
[2956.44 → 2958.30] And Jesus willingly says,
[2959.04 → 2960.10] instead of your judgment
[2960.10 → 2961.38] falling on your people,
[2962.08 → 2963.14] let me take it.
[2963.72 → 2965.08] Let me pay the penalty
[2965.08 → 2966.46] for their sin.
[2966.80 → 2967.88] Destroy me.
[2968.26 → 2968.90] Shun me.
[2969.46 → 2970.64] So that they will be free.
[2972.12 → 2973.16] That's the atonement
[2973.16 → 2974.22] that happens on the cross.
[2974.22 → 2975.14] Right?
[2975.24 → 2977.12] It's all of God's anger
[2977.12 → 2980.12] against all the sins
[2980.12 → 2980.78] of the people
[2980.78 → 2982.20] across all time
[2982.20 → 2984.02] all poured out
[2984.02 → 2985.84] on Jesus Christ
[2985.84 → 2986.44] on the cross.
[2987.36 → 2988.60] And in doing that,
[2989.42 → 2990.88] God's justice
[2990.88 → 2992.48] is satisfied.
[2993.04 → 2994.24] The debt has been paid.
[2994.54 → 2995.16] His judgment
[2995.16 → 2997.56] has been turned away from us.
[2998.06 → 2999.26] That's what the cross means.
[2999.34 → 3001.02] That we don't get God's wrath,
[3001.40 → 3002.58] but that we are covered.
[3002.58 → 3003.86] We are safe.
[3006.56 → 3007.22] And finally,
[3007.82 → 3009.34] we receive this gift
[3009.34 → 3010.46] of justification,
[3011.20 → 3011.84] of redemption,
[3012.38 → 3013.04] of grace,
[3013.36 → 3014.26] of atonement
[3014.26 → 3015.92] for our sins
[3015.92 → 3017.24] by faith.
[3017.56 → 3018.38] That's the fifth word
[3018.38 → 3019.12] that Paul uses.
[3021.02 → 3022.50] Paul says in verse 22,
[3023.02 → 3024.06] this righteousness
[3024.06 → 3024.82] is given
[3024.82 → 3025.78] through faith
[3025.78 → 3026.76] in Jesus Christ
[3026.76 → 3027.84] to all
[3027.84 → 3028.86] who believe.
[3030.12 → 3030.50] Right?
[3030.56 → 3031.80] And so on the one hand,
[3031.80 → 3032.56] we learn that
[3032.56 → 3033.90] whether you are somebody
[3033.90 → 3035.34] who is the sweetest,
[3035.84 → 3036.56] kindest,
[3036.66 → 3037.32] most patient
[3037.32 → 3038.16] kindergarten teacher
[3038.16 → 3039.02] ever,
[3039.86 → 3041.54] or whether you are
[3041.54 → 3042.78] the most wicked tyrant,
[3043.66 → 3044.68] whoever you are,
[3045.10 → 3045.88] because of sin,
[3045.94 → 3046.62] the playing field
[3046.62 → 3047.76] is levelled.
[3048.08 → 3049.08] Because all are
[3049.08 → 3049.90] equally sinners.
[3050.44 → 3051.74] But at the same time,
[3051.80 → 3053.06] this grace is also
[3053.06 → 3055.10] freely available
[3055.10 → 3056.38] to anyone
[3056.38 → 3057.68] because Jesus
[3057.68 → 3058.98] offers it to you
[3058.98 → 3059.54] as a gift
[3059.54 → 3061.28] through faith.
[3061.28 → 3061.34] faith.
[3062.14 → 3063.06] And that's what
[3063.06 → 3064.12] God wants from us.
[3064.66 → 3065.50] The only thing,
[3065.74 → 3065.92] actually,
[3066.02 → 3066.70] that we bring
[3066.70 → 3067.80] to this entire story
[3067.80 → 3068.56] is our sin.
[3069.90 → 3071.08] But through faith,
[3071.14 → 3072.10] which Paul says
[3072.10 → 3072.56] in Ephesians
[3072.56 → 3073.80] is also a gift,
[3074.92 → 3076.10] he changes our hearts,
[3076.18 → 3076.92] we're transformed,
[3077.10 → 3078.32] we recognize our sin,
[3078.40 → 3079.20] which by ourselves
[3079.20 → 3080.16] we cannot recognize,
[3080.84 → 3082.02] but we see it
[3082.02 → 3083.18] as our deepest need.
[3084.12 → 3084.84] And through faith,
[3084.92 → 3086.00] we have this posture
[3086.00 → 3086.82] of open hands
[3086.82 → 3087.48] before God
[3087.48 → 3089.66] where we can receive
[3089.66 → 3090.44] what he has done
[3090.44 → 3091.10] for us.
[3093.60 → 3094.66] So that's faith.
[3095.12 → 3095.72] And again,
[3095.84 → 3096.04] friends,
[3096.18 → 3098.88] this is the solution,
[3099.12 → 3100.00] this is the gift
[3100.00 → 3101.32] that we have received.
[3102.40 → 3103.44] Not from ourselves,
[3103.54 → 3104.18] but from God.
[3106.08 → 3107.12] So this passage,
[3107.98 → 3109.78] there's a third point
[3109.78 → 3110.40] I want us to see
[3110.40 → 3110.82] this morning.
[3110.90 → 3111.84] This passage reveals
[3111.84 → 3112.76] our deepest need,
[3113.42 → 3115.32] it reveals God's gift
[3115.32 → 3116.42] in Christ,
[3116.50 → 3117.34] but I think there's
[3117.34 → 3117.98] this third thing
[3117.98 → 3118.60] that we see
[3118.60 → 3119.70] that everything
[3119.70 → 3121.10] is actually leading up to,
[3121.94 → 3122.80] and that is the beauty
[3122.80 → 3123.82] of God's own righteousness.
[3124.58 → 3124.72] Okay,
[3124.72 → 3125.58] the beauty of God's
[3125.58 → 3126.08] own righteousness.
[3126.84 → 3128.48] And we read about this
[3128.48 → 3130.06] to finish off the passage
[3130.06 → 3132.08] again in verses 25 and 26.
[3133.54 → 3134.72] He did this
[3134.72 → 3135.48] to demonstrate
[3135.48 → 3136.30] his righteousness
[3136.30 → 3139.08] because in his forbearance
[3139.08 → 3139.94] he had left
[3139.94 → 3140.78] the sins committed
[3140.78 → 3142.30] beforehand unpunished
[3142.30 → 3143.34] he did it
[3143.34 → 3143.90] to demonstrate
[3143.90 → 3144.60] his righteousness.
[3145.00 → 3145.60] He said it again,
[3145.68 → 3145.84] right?
[3146.52 → 3147.78] At the present time
[3147.78 → 3149.58] to be just
[3149.58 → 3150.40] and the one
[3150.40 → 3151.28] who justifies
[3151.28 → 3152.52] those who have faith
[3152.52 → 3153.30] in Jesus.
[3157.00 → 3158.38] When people often
[3158.38 → 3159.48] think of the Old Testament,
[3159.72 → 3160.66] they think of God,
[3161.84 → 3163.30] we often have this idea
[3163.30 → 3164.90] that God is somehow
[3164.90 → 3165.74] always angry
[3165.74 → 3166.52] at his people.
[3167.12 → 3168.56] That God is
[3168.56 → 3170.24] always angry
[3170.24 → 3171.32] at his people
[3171.32 → 3172.58] breaking the law
[3172.58 → 3173.36] that he's always
[3173.36 → 3174.88] out to punish them.
[3175.76 → 3177.18] But that's hardly
[3177.18 → 3178.28] what we see
[3178.28 → 3178.86] when we read
[3178.86 → 3179.48] the Old Testament.
[3180.40 → 3180.56] You know,
[3180.62 → 3181.68] God more often
[3181.68 → 3182.16] than not,
[3182.24 → 3182.44] I mean,
[3182.50 → 3183.28] sometimes certainly
[3183.28 → 3184.78] we see God's anger
[3184.78 → 3186.18] break out on his people
[3186.18 → 3187.64] and it's often
[3187.64 → 3189.06] kind of so surprising
[3189.06 → 3190.80] because it is so rare.
[3191.80 → 3192.88] But more often
[3192.88 → 3193.42] than not,
[3193.52 → 3194.60] God is incredibly
[3194.60 → 3195.62] patient
[3195.62 → 3196.76] and gracious
[3196.76 → 3197.58] with his people,
[3198.44 → 3198.86] seemingly
[3198.86 → 3200.34] on the cheap.
[3201.40 → 3201.54] Right?
[3201.62 → 3202.54] For all of his people
[3202.54 → 3203.60] sin against him,
[3204.02 → 3206.02] what does God receive
[3206.02 → 3207.08] to put things right?
[3207.18 → 3207.46] I mean,
[3207.66 → 3208.40] the law
[3208.40 → 3210.48] is the lex talionis,
[3210.56 → 3211.38] eye for an eye.
[3211.58 → 3211.74] Right?
[3211.78 → 3213.58] If I sin against you,
[3213.78 → 3214.80] I kill your sheep,
[3215.06 → 3215.64] well you give me
[3215.64 → 3216.40] a sheep in return.
[3216.72 → 3217.04] That's,
[3217.28 → 3218.20] then it's made right.
[3219.14 → 3219.74] But think about
[3219.74 → 3220.30] our relationship
[3220.30 → 3220.96] with God
[3220.96 → 3222.10] for the people
[3222.10 → 3222.56] of God.
[3222.78 → 3224.18] When they sin
[3224.18 → 3224.70] against
[3224.70 → 3225.76] the creator
[3225.76 → 3226.58] of the universe,
[3226.80 → 3227.82] their king,
[3228.44 → 3229.24] their God,
[3229.58 → 3230.74] who has redeemed them,
[3231.02 → 3231.96] what does God get
[3231.96 → 3233.28] to make it right?
[3234.02 → 3234.76] A dove.
[3235.76 → 3236.02] Right?
[3236.12 → 3236.62] He gets
[3236.62 → 3237.76] some grain,
[3238.24 → 3239.16] something like that.
[3240.02 → 3241.66] It's not full restitution
[3241.66 → 3242.38] in any way.
[3243.24 → 3244.12] And it shows
[3244.12 → 3244.94] that he is
[3244.94 → 3246.48] so eager
[3246.48 → 3247.80] to forgive
[3247.80 → 3248.86] and to put our sins
[3248.86 → 3249.60] away from us.
[3250.54 → 3251.42] And so Paul now
[3251.42 → 3252.10] in Romans
[3252.10 → 3253.26] is reflecting on this
[3253.26 → 3253.80] and he says
[3253.80 → 3255.28] it seems to be the case
[3255.28 → 3255.96] that because God
[3255.96 → 3257.66] is so kind to us,
[3257.84 → 3259.52] he's a terrible judge.
[3260.56 → 3261.60] Like Paul talks about
[3261.60 → 3262.04] how God
[3262.04 → 3263.40] hasn't required us
[3263.40 → 3264.08] to pay the debt
[3264.08 → 3264.66] for our sin.
[3264.76 → 3266.30] He's left our sins
[3266.30 → 3267.04] unpunished,
[3267.10 → 3267.52] it says.
[3268.28 → 3269.38] But now
[3269.38 → 3270.40] with Jesus
[3270.40 → 3271.16] shedding his blood
[3271.16 → 3271.88] on the cross,
[3272.40 → 3273.96] the reason Paul gives,
[3274.72 → 3275.70] this is fascinating,
[3275.80 → 3276.88] the reason Paul gives
[3276.88 → 3278.00] is not only
[3278.00 → 3279.08] that we can be saved.
[3280.06 → 3281.22] What does Paul say?
[3282.16 → 3282.86] He says
[3282.86 → 3284.02] it's to show
[3284.02 → 3284.94] God's righteousness.
[3286.02 → 3286.16] Right?
[3286.20 → 3287.08] It's to demonstrate
[3287.08 → 3287.96] God's justice
[3287.96 → 3290.24] so he can be just
[3290.24 → 3292.34] and the justifier
[3292.34 → 3293.38] so that his
[3293.38 → 3294.98] righteous justice
[3294.98 → 3296.14] can be fulfilled
[3296.14 → 3297.66] and at the same time
[3297.66 → 3299.56] he can set us free.
[3299.94 → 3300.64] That he can
[3300.64 → 3301.98] remove our judgment
[3301.98 → 3303.62] and redeem us
[3303.62 → 3304.20] to himself.
[3304.94 → 3305.86] In other words,
[3305.96 → 3306.52] God has been
[3306.52 → 3307.60] giving out grace
[3307.60 → 3308.34] and mercy
[3308.34 → 3308.90] to his people
[3308.90 → 3309.58] for centuries
[3309.58 → 3310.80] and now
[3310.80 → 3312.30] Jesus is offered
[3312.30 → 3314.04] as that costly
[3314.04 → 3315.90] sacrifice for sin
[3315.90 → 3317.44] so that God
[3317.44 → 3318.06] can show that
[3318.06 → 3318.78] in being merciful
[3318.78 → 3319.54] to his people
[3319.54 → 3321.22] he's not doing it
[3321.22 → 3321.86] on the cheap.
[3322.18 → 3322.28] Right?
[3322.32 → 3322.92] He's not just
[3322.92 → 3323.70] somehow doing it
[3323.70 → 3324.18] casually.
[3324.60 → 3325.50] He's not just saying,
[3325.88 → 3326.54] oh, you know,
[3326.58 → 3327.08] your sin,
[3327.18 → 3327.88] just don't worry
[3327.88 → 3328.50] about it.
[3329.20 → 3329.86] He's not being
[3329.86 → 3330.92] a bad judge
[3330.92 → 3331.90] and just letting
[3331.90 → 3333.30] wicked people
[3333.30 → 3333.74] and sinners
[3333.74 → 3334.34] go free
[3334.34 → 3335.08] for nothing.
[3335.08 → 3337.96] God is just.
[3338.78 → 3339.52] His justice
[3339.52 → 3340.64] is upheld.
[3342.06 → 3343.06] Sin is paid for.
[3343.68 → 3344.60] Justice is done
[3344.60 → 3345.64] because of the
[3345.64 → 3346.52] atoning sacrifice
[3346.52 → 3347.06] of Jesus.
[3347.98 → 3349.28] So Jesus is not only
[3349.28 → 3350.46] the gift of God's grace
[3350.46 → 3351.36] but he's also
[3351.36 → 3352.68] the demonstration
[3352.68 → 3354.66] that God is just.
[3355.00 → 3356.02] He is trustworthy.
[3356.36 → 3357.02] He is a God
[3357.02 → 3358.94] that we want to be with.
[3359.02 → 3359.90] He's not going to
[3359.90 → 3360.94] set us free
[3360.94 → 3361.92] then because it didn't
[3361.92 → 3362.58] cost us anything
[3362.58 → 3363.74] say, oh, never mind.
[3363.82 → 3364.86] I'm going to condemn you again.
[3365.08 → 3365.76] That's never going
[3365.76 → 3366.56] to happen to us
[3366.56 → 3369.04] because Jesus paid it all.
[3369.20 → 3370.08] He paid the price.
[3371.66 → 3372.54] God isn't bending
[3372.54 → 3373.48] the rules.
[3374.28 → 3375.04] God isn't somehow
[3375.04 → 3376.36] ignoring the demands
[3376.36 → 3377.00] of the law.
[3377.36 → 3378.54] He is making it whole.
[3379.30 → 3380.36] He is making things
[3380.36 → 3381.44] right himself
[3381.44 → 3382.80] by bearing our burdens.
[3383.54 → 3384.62] He does everything
[3384.62 → 3385.28] necessary
[3385.28 → 3386.62] to ensure that
[3386.62 → 3387.42] we can be with him
[3387.42 → 3387.74] forever.
[3390.10 → 3391.66] God's perfect justice,
[3392.64 → 3394.90] God's holy love
[3394.90 → 3396.52] meet.
[3397.08 → 3397.98] Both of them
[3397.98 → 3398.90] coming together
[3398.90 → 3400.42] on the cross
[3400.42 → 3400.84] of Jesus.
[3402.26 → 3403.10] That, friends,
[3403.16 → 3404.26] is what the cross
[3404.26 → 3404.84] has done
[3404.84 → 3405.94] to turn away
[3405.94 → 3406.52] our judgment.
[3408.30 → 3409.74] And in many ways,
[3409.96 → 3410.96] the clearest
[3410.96 → 3411.92] and most tangible
[3411.92 → 3413.40] picture of this
[3413.40 → 3415.60] is when you and I
[3415.60 → 3416.76] receive this meal,
[3417.56 → 3418.32] the Lord's Supper,
[3418.74 → 3419.84] that we are about
[3419.84 → 3420.82] to take in a moment.
[3420.82 → 3422.28] where you're going
[3422.28 → 3423.92] to take a cup
[3423.92 → 3425.78] and I'm going
[3425.78 → 3426.66] to say to you,
[3427.58 → 3428.36] this is the blood
[3428.36 → 3429.04] of Christ
[3429.04 → 3429.98] shed for you.
[3431.48 → 3432.44] Think about
[3432.44 → 3434.78] what that cost.
[3435.98 → 3437.36] It should have been
[3437.36 → 3439.12] a cup of judgment
[3439.12 → 3441.16] on your sin,
[3441.68 → 3442.50] but instead,
[3442.90 → 3443.70] it's the blood
[3443.70 → 3444.46] of Christ,
[3444.60 → 3446.36] the atoning sacrifice,
[3446.82 → 3448.30] poured out for us.
[3448.30 → 3450.16] because of Jesus'
[3450.40 → 3451.06] work on the cross
[3451.06 → 3451.48] for you,
[3451.54 → 3452.56] it's not a cup
[3452.56 → 3453.12] of judgment,
[3453.78 → 3454.58] but instead,
[3455.18 → 3456.14] it's a cup
[3456.14 → 3456.82] of fellowship.
[3457.38 → 3457.92] It's a cup
[3457.92 → 3458.70] of communion.
[3459.40 → 3459.80] It's a cup
[3459.80 → 3460.32] of love
[3460.32 → 3462.42] where we drink
[3462.42 → 3464.00] it and receive
[3464.00 → 3464.92] God's grace,
[3465.14 → 3465.92] not his judgment.
[3466.92 → 3468.16] So let's pray
[3468.16 → 3469.06] and we'll sing
[3469.06 → 3469.80] and then we will
[3469.80 → 3470.56] come to the Lord's
[3470.56 → 3471.12] table together.
[3471.46 → 3471.92] Let's pray.
[3471.92 → 3471.98] Let's pray.
[3471.98 → 3475.70] Father,
[3475.86 → 3477.12] we thank you
[3477.12 → 3478.44] for these words
[3478.44 → 3479.50] of hope,
[3480.50 → 3481.86] these beautiful words
[3481.86 → 3482.44] of the gospel.
[3484.26 → 3484.62] And Father,
[3484.76 → 3485.64] we pray that
[3485.64 → 3487.82] because it is so hard
[3487.82 → 3488.76] for us to understand,
[3488.94 → 3490.64] it's so counterintuitive,
[3491.84 → 3493.20] our hearts are still
[3493.20 → 3494.28] hard,
[3494.48 → 3495.20] our ears
[3495.20 → 3497.00] stopped up,
[3497.64 → 3498.82] our eyes dim
[3498.82 → 3499.34] of seeing.
[3500.16 → 3500.44] Lord,
[3500.50 → 3501.54] we need you
[3501.54 → 3503.62] to continually,
[3503.96 → 3505.00] by your Holy Spirit,
[3506.36 → 3507.12] take the scales
[3507.12 → 3507.84] off our eyes
[3507.84 → 3509.12] and stop our ears,
[3510.06 → 3511.02] soften our hearts
[3511.02 → 3512.94] that we might see
[3512.94 → 3514.32] our salvation.
[3514.80 → 3516.24] And because seeing it,
[3516.34 → 3516.42] Lord,
[3516.48 → 3517.46] that we would glorify
[3517.46 → 3517.90] your name
[3517.90 → 3519.98] and we would live
[3519.98 → 3521.24] as those who are,
[3521.38 → 3522.14] excuse me,
[3523.00 → 3523.84] live as those
[3523.84 → 3524.54] who are truly free.
[3526.00 → 3526.44] Lord,
[3526.50 → 3527.58] receive our praise now
[3527.58 → 3528.44] and Lord,
[3528.52 → 3529.32] meet us at your table.
[3529.34 → 3531.12] we pray in Jesus' name.
[3531.50 → 3531.72] Amen.
[3531.72 → 3549.10] He became sin,
[3550.10 → 3552.26] who knew no sin,
[3552.50 → 3554.30] that we might become
[3554.30 → 3556.64] His righteousness.
[3556.64 → 3559.30] He humbled Himself
[3559.30 → 3563.88] and carried the cross.
[3563.88 → 3567.02] Love so amazing,
[3567.02 → 3571.76] love so amazing,
[3571.76 → 3576.56] Jesus Messiah,
[3578.56 → 3583.32] name above all names,
[3583.32 → 3586.32] bless the Redeemer,
[3586.32 → 3586.48] bless the Redeemer,
[3588.48 → 3589.90] Emmanuel,
[3592.90 → 3596.32] the rescue for sinners,
[3596.32 → 3600.98] their ransom from heaven,
[3600.98 → 3605.58] Jesus Messiah,
[3607.64 → 3610.28] Lord of all.
[3610.28 → 3613.10] He claimed on God.
[3613.10 → 3617.18] His Body and to all,
[3617.18 → 3618.14] He ransacked later,
[3618.14 → 3620.68] upon the tribute to theoloividus cube,
[3620.68 → 3622.46] He gave the pleasure soon surf,
[3622.46 → 3623.20] or mode offer percent.
[3623.28 → 3625.72] will be GOD move compiled aside,
[3625.72 → 3625.82] on the α,
[3625.82 → 3629.66] The field was torn
[3629.66 → 3634.46] Love so amazing
[3634.46 → 3639.42] Love so amazing
[3639.42 → 3644.06] Jesus, Messiah
[3644.06 → 3648.86] Name above all names
[3648.86 → 3653.50] Blessed Redeemer
[3653.50 → 3658.14] Emmanuel
[3658.14 → 3662.86] The rescue for sinners
[3662.86 → 3667.82] The ransom from heaven
[3667.82 → 3672.62] Jesus, Messiah
[3672.62 → 3677.74] Lord of all
[3677.74 → 3682.30] All our hope is in you
[3682.30 → 3686.94] All our hope is in you
[3686.94 → 3693.66] All glory to you, God
[3693.66 → 3698.78] The light of the world
[3698.78 → 3703.42] Jesus, Messiah
[3703.42 → 3708.06] Name above all names
[3708.06 → 3712.70] Blessed Redeemer
[3712.70 → 3716.70] In all your hope is in you
[3716.70 → 3721.42] The rescue for sinners
[3721.42 → 3725.50] The ransom from heaven
[3725.50 → 3730.14] Jesus, Messiah
[3730.14 → 3732.14] Jesus, Messiah
[3732.14 → 3734.14] Lord of all
[3734.14 → 3744.78] The ransom from heaven
[3744.78 → 3747.50] The ransom from heaven
[3747.50 → 3752.78] The ransom from heaven
[3752.78 → 3754.66] Move this out of the way
[3754.66 → 3755.82] Make sure everyone can see
[3755.82 → 3764.38] So this is the table
[3764.38 → 3766.78] Of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3766.78 → 3769.42] And he invites us
[3769.42 → 3770.62] By his grace
[3770.62 → 3771.82] Because of his love
[3771.82 → 3774.22] To commune with him
[3774.22 → 3776.62] But friends, this invitation
[3776.62 → 3778.30] Is not for everyone
[3778.30 → 3781.50] And if you have put your faith in Jesus
[3781.50 → 3783.90] As the one who has died in your place
[3783.90 → 3785.98] So that you can be forgiven
[3785.98 → 3787.26] And that you can be called
[3787.26 → 3788.62] A child of God
[3788.62 → 3790.14] And experience that freedom
[3790.14 → 3792.28] Then Jesus invites you
[3792.28 → 3793.82] Freely to come to this table
[3793.82 → 3795.70] To share in this meal
[3795.70 → 3798.48] But if you are not yet
[3798.48 → 3799.68] A follower of Jesus
[3799.68 → 3801.00] If you have not yet
[3801.00 → 3802.52] Received his grace
[3802.52 → 3803.28] Through faith
[3803.28 → 3804.18] And if you have not yet
[3804.18 → 3804.78] Been baptized
[3804.78 → 3806.98] As a sign and seal
[3806.98 → 3808.52] Of that promise
[3808.52 → 3810.12] Then this table
[3810.12 → 3811.38] Is not yet for you
[3811.38 → 3812.40] And we ask that you
[3812.40 → 3813.32] Would not participate
[3813.32 → 3815.52] But at the same time
[3815.52 → 3817.02] We ask that you would
[3817.02 → 3820.46] Consider what the cross
[3820.46 → 3821.24] Means for you
[3821.24 → 3822.22] And that you would
[3822.22 → 3823.90] Put your hope
[3823.90 → 3825.16] In Christ
[3825.16 → 3826.26] By faith
[3826.26 → 3831.10] So now here are these words
[3831.10 → 3834.08] Where Paul tells us
[3834.08 → 3835.06] How the Lord Jesus
[3835.06 → 3837.98] Instituted the sacrament
[3837.98 → 3838.74] Of the Lord's Supper
[3838.74 → 3840.42] He says this
[3840.42 → 3841.16] The Lord Jesus
[3841.16 → 3842.56] On the night when he was betrayed
[3842.56 → 3843.90] He took bread
[3843.90 → 3845.22] And when he had given thanks
[3845.22 → 3846.18] He broke it
[3846.18 → 3846.80] And said
[3846.80 → 3848.28] This is my body
[3848.28 → 3850.62] Which is broken for you
[3850.62 → 3852.38] Do this in remembrance
[3852.38 → 3853.38] Of me
[3853.38 → 3855.72] The same way
[3855.72 → 3857.06] Also he took the cup
[3857.06 → 3857.82] After supper
[3857.82 → 3858.96] Saying this cup
[3858.96 → 3860.42] Is the new covenant
[3860.42 → 3861.46] In my blood
[3861.46 → 3863.64] For as often
[3863.64 → 3865.06] As you drink it
[3865.06 → 3866.96] You do it
[3866.96 → 3868.44] In remembrance of me
[3868.44 → 3871.24] Then Jesus said
[3871.24 → 3872.10] For as often
[3872.10 → 3873.80] As you eat this bread
[3873.80 → 3875.36] And you drink this cup
[3875.36 → 3876.74] In doing so
[3876.74 → 3877.54] In doing so you proclaim
[3877.54 → 3878.60] The Lord's death
[3878.60 → 3880.92] Until he comes again
[3880.92 → 3882.90] So brothers and sisters
[3882.90 → 3885.32] These are the gifts of God
[3885.32 → 3887.26] For the people of God
[3887.26 → 3888.74] So as we come to the table
[3888.74 → 3889.30] This morning
[3889.30 → 3890.22] I invite you
[3890.22 → 3892.26] To feed on him
[3892.26 → 3893.98] In your hearts
[3893.98 → 3895.36] By faith
[3895.36 → 3896.98] With thanksgiving
[3896.98 → 3898.58] Knowing that Jesus
[3898.58 → 3899.88] Has died for you
[3899.88 → 3901.92] And so as we take
[3901.92 → 3903.76] The bread and the cup
[3903.76 → 3904.70] This is a time
[3904.70 → 3905.84] To remember
[3905.84 → 3907.74] The cross
[3907.74 → 3908.66] It's a time to
[3908.66 → 3909.98] Remember
[3909.98 → 3911.00] Jesus'
[3911.46 → 3912.96] Sacrifice
[3912.96 → 3914.56] Of his broken body
[3914.56 → 3915.64] His poured out blood
