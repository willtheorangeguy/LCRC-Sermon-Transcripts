[740.18 → 747.18] We will feast and weep no more
[747.18 → 755.18] We will not be burned by the fire
[755.18 → 761.18] He is the Lord our God
[761.18 → 767.18] We are not consumed by the flood
[767.18 → 770.18] He is the Lord our God
[770.18 → 771.18] We are not consumed by the flood
[771.18 → 773.18] Our pelt protected gather
[773.18 → 778.18] We will feast in the house of Zion
[778.18 → 785.18] We will feast and weep no more
[785.18 → 787.18] He has done great things
[787.18 → 789.18] We will feast and weep no more
[789.18 → 791.18] In the dark of night before the dawn
[791.18 → 795.18] We will feast and weep no more
[795.18 → 798.18] We will feast and weep no more

[806.18 → 812.18] For the promised morning, oh how long

[824.18 → 830.18] We will feast in the house of Zion
[830.18 → 835.18] We will sing with our most restored
[835.18 → 848.18] We will feast and weep no more
[848.18 → 849.18] In the dark of night before the dawn
[849.18 → 850.18] We will feast and weep no more
[850.18 → 854.18] Every vow we've broken and betrayed
[854.18 → 860.18] You are the faithful one
[860.18 → 866.18] And from the garden to the grave
[866.18 → 873.18] Find us together, bring shalom
[873.18 → 879.18] We will feast in the house of Zion
[879.18 → 898.18] We will feast and weep no more
[898.18 → 913.22] For our time of confession, hear these words from 1 John 1, 5-8 and 10.
[914.18 → 918.22] This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you,
[918.86 → 922.26] God is light, in him there is no darkness at all.
[922.72 → 926.68] If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness,
[926.68 → 929.20] we lie and do not live out the truth.
[929.72 → 932.96] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
[933.20 → 936.60] we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus,
[937.02 → 939.48] his son purifies us from all sin.
[940.18 → 945.64] If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[946.02 → 952.16] If we have claimed we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
[954.06 → 955.20] Let's pray together.
[956.68 → 962.00] We confess, Lord, that we deceive ourselves when we overlook our sin.
[962.94 → 967.12] We cannot be whole unless we confront ourselves and our inner darkness.
[968.46 → 971.78] Forgive us when we hurt you and others by what we do
[971.78 → 976.14] or by what we are called to do but choose to ignore.
[977.20 → 981.98] We take a moment now to be still before you in personal confession.
[981.98 → 999.66] Thank you, merciful God, for hearing us and providing a way for our redemption.
[999.66 → 1000.94] Amen.
[1000.94 → 1024.42] God, behold the wondrous mystery, heaven-dawning of the King.
[1024.42 → 1032.34] He is the name of heaven's praises, Roman frail humanity.
[1033.40 → 1042.32] In our longing, in our darkness, now the light of life has come.
[1042.74 → 1050.62] Come to Christ who God has sent it, took on flesh to ransom us.
[1050.62 → 1054.66] Come to Christ who God has sent it, took on flesh to ransom us.
[1054.66 → 1066.72] Come to God, behold the wondrous mystery, he that puffed his son of man.
[1066.72 → 1075.44] In His living, in His suffering, never thrift nor stand of sin
[1075.44 → 1084.26] Teeth the true and better order, come to save the hell-bound man
[1084.26 → 1093.54] Christ the great and sure fulfillment of the law, in Him, we stand
[1096.72 → 1109.32] 1 John 1.9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
[1109.32 → 1122.02] Come behold the wondrous mystery Christ alone upon the tree
[1122.02 → 1130.02] In this head of frowning sinners, hands and lamb in victory
[1130.02 → 1139.02] See the price of our redemption, see the Father's plan unfold
[1139.02 → 1149.02] Bringing many sons to glory Grace unmeasured, love untold
[1149.02 → 1161.02] Come behold the wondrous mystery Slain by death, the Son of life
[1161.02 → 1171.02] But no great good will restrain Him Praise the Lord, He is alive
[1171.02 → 1179.02] What a fortress of deliverance How unwavering our own
[1179.02 → 1189.02] Christ in power resurrected As we will be when He comes
[1189.02 → 1199.02] What a fortress of deliverance How unwavering our own
[1199.02 → 1209.02] Christ in power resurrected As He will be when He comes
[1209.02 → 1219.02] What a fortress of deliverance
[1219.02 → 1237.02] We have many things to bring to God in prayer this morning
[1237.02 → 1247.02] Our condolences go out to Human who received news this week that his father passed away in South Sudan
[1247.02 → 1261.02] Julie who has undergone multiple surgeries for brain tumours received news this week that there is more tumour and more growth, and she awaits news about how those will be treated
[1261.02 → 1268.02] We pray for John and Wilma John has leukemia and is receiving treatment
[1268.02 → 1275.02] We also pray for John and Janet As John has recently been diagnosed with myeloma
[1275.02 → 1283.02] Before we go to God in prayer I'd like to read to you the lyrics of a song written in the 1980s by Annie Herring
[1283.02 → 1285.02] It's called Night Light
[1285.02 → 1291.02] It makes me think of when our grandkids come down, and we have to put a little nightlight in their room
[1291.02 → 1297.02] I wonder how many of the kids here and maybe even adults love to have a nightlight in the darkness of the night
[1297.02 → 1304.02] That nightlight gives us comfort, and it keeps our imaginations from getting away with us
[1304.02 → 1308.02] Listen to these lyrics
[1308.02 → 1314.02] All along in my life you've been there
[1314.02 → 1319.02] Ever presently watching always in your care
[1319.02 → 1325.02] And I just want to thank you for loving me so
[1325.02 → 1331.02] And I just want to thank you for never, never letting go
[1331.02 → 1335.02] Through the storms at night you would shine your light
[1335.02 → 1338.02] Until the break of day
[1338.02 → 1342.02] Through the storms at night you would hold me tight
[1342.02 → 1348.02] And never, never, never leave my side
[1348.02 → 1352.02] You're my nightlight
[1352.02 → 1354.02] Let's pray
[1354.02 → 1357.02] Light of the world
[1357.02 → 1359.02] You came down into darkness
[1359.02 → 1363.02] And still you come down to us in our darkness
[1363.02 → 1366.02] Darkness that often threatens to overwhelm us
[1366.02 → 1369.02] We feel the heaviness of the world around us
[1369.02 → 1374.02] We feel the loneliness and desperation that increases with this pandemic
[1374.02 → 1378.02] We give thanks for dedicated healthcare workers
[1378.02 → 1381.02] Often exhausted by long hours and extra shifts
[1381.02 → 1384.02] Compounded by their own vulnerability to the virus
[1384.02 → 1392.02] We give thanks for researchers who have created vaccines and pharmacists who work to produce them
[1392.02 → 1396.02] May their distribution go smoothly and be well prioritized
[1396.02 → 1402.02] Even in the midst of this global crisis other situations rise to the surface
[1402.02 → 1409.02] We pray that a solution may be found for the ongoing gang violence in the lower mainland
[1409.02 → 1412.02] This is a domestic war that seems so senseless
[1412.02 → 1415.02] Intervene on the streets of our cities, Lord
[1415.02 → 1425.02] Your light is so desperately needed here and in the related issues of drug addiction that leads to marginalization, homelessness and destitution
[1425.02 → 1427.02] Bring relief, we pray
[1427.02 → 1432.02] We see the hatred and violence that occurs across the border
[1432.02 → 1436.02] The United States now very divided
[1436.02 → 1439.02] May healing begin in that country
[1439.02 → 1443.02] May there be peace at this week's inauguration ceremonies
[1443.02 → 1451.02] And let us not be smug Canadians for we know how easily we fall into hatefulness, pride and rebellion
[1451.02 → 1458.02] Bring us all in humility to you and replace our foolishness with your wisdom
[1458.02 → 1462.02] We pray for those who mourn the recent loss of loved ones
[1462.02 → 1467.02] Sandy, Noreen, Steen, Jane and Lynn and their families
[1467.02 → 1470.02] And Cathy's family and friends
[1470.02 → 1475.02] Comfort Human who received news of his father's death
[1475.02 → 1480.02] This is so hard, especially when Human is half a world away
[1480.02 → 1485.02] Lord, we have a long list of brothers and sisters who are ill
[1485.02 → 1490.02] We pray urgently for Julie and her family as they walk this incredibly long journey with brain tumours
[1490.02 → 1493.02] And their effects on Julie's health
[1493.02 → 1497.02] Hold them all close as Julie learns what the next steps are for her
[1497.02 → 1500.02] Give her physicians wisdom and above all
[1500.02 → 1504.02] May the treatments be effective in shrinking these growths
[1504.02 → 1507.02] We pray for John and Wilma
[1507.02 → 1510.02] And John and Janet who are dealing with the diagnoses of cancer
[1510.02 → 1513.02] We pray for healing for these men
[1513.02 → 1517.02] Holy Spirit, great comforter
[1517.02 → 1519.02] Inhabit their lives and hearts
[1519.02 → 1525.02] Continue to walk with Joan and Kim who also struggle with the effects of cancer
[1525.02 → 1530.02] Joan's journey too has been so long and tiring, Lord
[1530.02 → 1533.02] And Kim suffers incredible continuous pain
[1533.02 → 1536.02] We have prayed for that pain to be taken away
[1536.02 → 1540.02] And yet she continues to suffer and decline in agony
[1540.02 → 1545.02] We lament this with her and George and their families, Lord
[1545.02 → 1550.02] We don't know how to pray for them except to say, Christ, have mercy
[1550.02 → 1552.02] Have mercy
[1552.02 → 1557.02] You are our light, our life, and our deepest joy
[1557.02 → 1561.02] Keep us close to your heart as we navigate the trials of this life
[1561.02 → 1569.02] Shine your light before us, around us, and dare we ask, even through us
[1569.02 → 1575.02] Be strength in our weakness, light in our darkness, and joy in our sadness
[1575.02 → 1578.02] Your steadfast love never fails
[1578.02 → 1583.02] We have come this far by faith and will walk in the light of your love
[1583.02 → 1585.02] For you have promised it
[1585.02 → 1588.02] Come quickly, Lord Jesus
[1588.02 → 1590.02] In your powerful name we pray
[1590.02 → 1591.02] Amen
[1591.02 → 1592.02] Amen
[1592.02 → 1598.02] Thank you for leading us in that prayer, Marian
[1598.02 → 1603.02] So, good morning, friends
[1603.02 → 1606.02] About two months ago already
[1606.02 → 1612.02] Christians around the world began our yearly pilgrimage
[1612.02 → 1615.02] Through the church calendar, marking our days
[1615.02 → 1617.02] By the birth and ministry
[1617.02 → 1621.02] And the suffering and death and resurrection
[1621.02 → 1624.02] Ascension and Pentecost of Jesus
[1624.02 → 1629.02] And all of this began, you will remember, with Advent
[1629.02 → 1632.02] The season of darkness and of longing
[1632.02 → 1636.02] Then, in this deeply Christian movement
[1636.02 → 1643.02] We have now moved from that season of darkness into a season of light
[1643.02 → 1644.02] Two seasons, actually
[1644.02 → 1646.02] The first of these is Christmas
[1646.02 → 1650.02] Where we celebrated that Jesus, the light, has come
[1650.02 → 1654.02] Those of us, you know, who dwell in darkness
[1654.02 → 1657.02] You know whether it's the darkness of sickness
[1657.02 → 1659.02] Or loneliness or despair
[1659.02 → 1661.02] Or grief or disappointment
[1661.02 → 1663.02] Addiction or fear
[1663.02 → 1665.02] We are not alone
[1665.02 → 1668.02] Because it is precisely into these places of darkness
[1668.02 → 1672.02] That in Jesus, the light of the living God
[1672.02 → 1674.02] Has come to us
[1675.02 → 1680.02] This light, however, cannot be contained only in one season
[1680.02 → 1682.02] And so we pass immediately from Christmas
[1682.02 → 1684.02] Into the next season, where we are now
[1684.02 → 1686.02] Which is Epiphany
[1686.02 → 1688.02] And in the message of Epiphany
[1688.02 → 1691.02] It is that Jesus, the light of God
[1691.02 → 1693.02] Has come not only to us personally
[1693.02 → 1695.02] But to the entire world
[1695.02 → 1698.02] And as Christians, part of the purpose of our lives
[1698.02 → 1701.02] Is to bear this light into the world
[1701.02 → 1704.02] In the places where we live, and we work
[1704.02 → 1706.02] And so in this season of Epiphany
[1706.02 → 1708.02] We are in a sermon series
[1708.02 → 1710.02] On the am saints of Jesus
[1710.02 → 1712.02] In the Gospel of John
[1712.02 → 1715.02] Where Jesus reveals to us in a very deep way
[1715.02 → 1716.02] Who he is
[1716.02 → 1719.02] And what he has come to bring to the world
[1719.02 → 1721.02] And today
[1721.02 → 1723.02] We are going to be looking at
[1723.02 → 1725.02] Where Jesus says
[1725.02 → 1727.02] I am the light of the world
[1727.02 → 1729.02] And so we are going to be
[1729.02 → 1731.02] Mostly in chapter 9
[1731.02 → 1733.02] We will read kind of the key statement
[1733.02 → 1735.02] Where Jesus says this in John 8
[1735.02 → 1738.02] But then in chapter 9
[1738.02 → 1739.02] Which is a very long chapter
[1739.02 → 1741.02] We are not going to read all of it
[1741.02 → 1744.02] But what we see is this miracle that Jesus does
[1744.02 → 1747.02] Where he heals a man who was born blind
[1747.02 → 1751.02] And so just as the feeding of the 5,000
[1751.02 → 1757.02] Symbolized Jesus' ability to satisfy our spiritual hunger
[1757.02 → 1759.02] The healing of the man born blind
[1759.02 → 1764.02] Symbolizes his ability to heal our spiritual blindness
[1764.02 → 1766.02] And so let's read our passage
[1766.02 → 1768.02] We are going to have it up on the screen
[1769.02 → 1772.02] And please give your attention to the reading of God's word
[1772.02 → 1775.02] When Jesus spoke again to the people
[1775.02 → 1776.02] He said
[1776.02 → 1778.02] I am the light of the world
[1778.02 → 1781.02] Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness
[1781.02 → 1784.02] But will have the light of life
[1784.02 → 1788.02] Now jumping forward to chapter 9
[1788.02 → 1792.02] As he went along he saw a man blind from birth
[1792.02 → 1794.02] His disciples asked him
[1794.02 → 1796.02] Rabbi, who sinned?
[1796.02 → 1797.02] This man?
[1797.02 → 1799.02] Or his parents?
[1799.02 → 1800.02] That he was born blind
[1800.02 → 1803.02] Neither this man nor his parents sinned
[1803.02 → 1804.02] Said Jesus
[1804.02 → 1806.02] But this happened
[1806.02 → 1807.02] So that the works of God
[1807.02 → 1809.02] Might be displayed in him
[1809.02 → 1813.02] As long as it is day
[1813.02 → 1815.02] We must do the works of him who sent me
[1815.02 → 1818.02] Night is coming when no one can work
[1818.02 → 1820.02] While I am in the world
[1820.02 → 1822.02] I am the light of the world
[1822.02 → 1824.02] After saying this
[1824.02 → 1825.02] He spit on the ground
[1825.02 → 1826.02] He spit on the ground
[1826.02 → 1828.02] Made some mud with the saliva
[1828.02 → 1830.02] And put it on the man's eyes
[1830.02 → 1833.02] Go, he told him
[1833.02 → 1835.02] Wash in the pool of Siloam
[1835.02 → 1837.02] This word means sent
[1837.02 → 1839.02] So the man went and washed
[1839.02 → 1841.02] And he came home seeing
[1843.02 → 1844.02] Jumping forward
[1844.02 → 1846.02] At the end of chapter 9
[1846.02 → 1847.02] It says this
[1847.02 → 1849.02] Jesus heard that they had thrown him out
[1849.02 → 1850.02] That is the man who was born blind
[1850.02 → 1852.02] And when he found him
[1852.02 → 1854.02] He said, do you believe in the son of man?
[1854.02 → 1856.02] Who is he, sir?
[1856.02 → 1857.02] The man asked
[1857.02 → 1860.02] Tell me so that I may believe in him also
[1861.02 → 1864.02] Jesus said, you have now seen him
[1864.02 → 1867.02] In fact, he is the one speaking with you
[1868.02 → 1872.02] Then the man said, Lord, I believe
[1872.02 → 1873.02] I believe
[1873.02 → 1874.02] And he worshipped him
[1874.02 → 1877.02] Jesus said, for judgment
[1877.02 → 1878.02] I have come into this world
[1878.02 → 1880.02] So that the blind will see
[1880.02 → 1882.02] And those who will see become blind
[1883.02 → 1884.02] Some Pharisees who were with him
[1884.02 → 1885.02] Heard him say this
[1885.02 → 1888.02] And asked, what are we blind to?
[1890.02 → 1892.02] Jesus said, if you were blind
[1892.02 → 1894.02] You would not be guilty of sin
[1894.02 → 1896.02] But now that you claim you can see
[1896.02 → 1898.02] Your guilt remains
[1898.02 → 1900.02] This is the word of the Lord
[1900.02 → 1902.02] It is absolutely true
[1902.02 → 1904.02] And God gives it to us
[1904.02 → 1906.02] Because he loves us
[1906.02 → 1908.02] So let's come before the Lord
[1908.02 → 1910.02] In prayer as we get ready to
[1910.02 → 1912.02] Dig into this passage together
[1912.02 → 1913.02] Let's pray
[1913.02 → 1914.02] Lord, we
[1916.02 → 1918.02] Like the man who is blind, Lord
[1918.02 → 1920.02] We need Jesus to come
[1921.02 → 1922.02] To us
[1922.02 → 1924.02] And lay his hands upon us
[1924.02 → 1925.02] And open our eyes
[1926.02 → 1928.02] So, Lord, by your Holy Spirit
[1928.02 → 1929.02] This morning
[1929.02 → 1930.02] Would you open our eyes
[1930.02 → 1932.02] Would you help us to see Jesus clearly?
[1932.02 → 1934.02] To say, Lord, I believe
[1935.02 → 1937.02] And Lord, help us to follow him
[1937.02 → 1938.02] We pray in Jesus' name
[1938.02 → 1939.02] Amen
[1940.02 → 1943.02] So, please listen to this quote
[1945.02 → 1949.02] He who has not seen the joy of this place
[1950.02 → 1952.02] Has never in his life seen joy
[1952.02 → 1954.02] And what this Jewish rabbi is referring to is the Feast of Tabernacles
[1954.02 → 1955.02] And so when Jesus says,
[1955.02 → 1958.02] He who has not seen the joy of this place
[1958.02 → 1959.02] Has never in his life seen joy
[1959.02 → 1963.02] And what this Jewish rabbi is referring to is the Feast of Tabernacles
[1963.02 → 1964.02] And so when Jesus says, I am the light of the world
[1964.02 → 1966.02] And so when Jesus says, I am the light of the world
[1966.02 → 1970.02] That statement is found in John chapters 7 through 9
[1970.02 → 1975.02] And the backdrop of these chapters, what's going on
[1975.02 → 1978.02] And what's going on is the Feast of Tabernacles
[1978.02 → 1981.02] And so when Jesus says, I am the light of the world
[1981.02 → 1984.02] That statement is found in John chapters 7 through 9
[1984.02 → 1993.02] And the backdrop of these chapters, what's going on
[1993.02 → 1995.02] Is the Feast of Tabernacles
[1996.02 → 1997.02] And so what would happen
[1998.02 → 2000.02] Is on the very first night of the feast
[2000.02 → 2003.02] They'd have what's called the Festival of Lights
[2004.02 → 2006.02] And in the middle of the temple grounds
[2006.02 → 2009.02] There would be these four giant lamp stands
[2009.02 → 2011.02] They were about 75 feet tall
[2011.02 → 2014.02] Extending way up into the sky
[2014.02 → 2017.02] And each one of those lamp stands
[2017.02 → 2020.02] Held four large cauldrons of oil
[2020.02 → 2023.02] And the cauldrons were lined with gold
[2024.02 → 2027.02] And in a time before electricity
[2027.02 → 2030.02] The cities at night were mostly dark
[2030.02 → 2031.02] Right?
[2031.02 → 2034.02] So there might be a few scattered torches or candles
[2034.02 → 2036.02] But the city of Jerusalem and the temple grounds
[2036.02 → 2040.02] Would have been dark or very dim at night
[2040.02 → 2044.02] But what they would do on the first night of the festival
[2045.02 → 2048.02] Is that these 16 golden cauldrons of oil
[2048.02 → 2049.02] Would be lit
[2050.02 → 2052.02] And with the gold shining and the fires
[2053.02 → 2055.02] It would be this massive light
[2055.02 → 2058.02] That was almost unimaginable to people
[2058.02 → 2059.02] In pre-electric times
[2060.02 → 2061.02] And the glow from the temple
[2061.02 → 2062.02] From these lanterns
[2063.02 → 2065.02] Would light up the whole city of Jerusalem
[2066.02 → 2068.02] And the lighting of these lamps
[2068.02 → 2069.02] And the church was just kicked off
[2069.02 → 2070.02] This exuberant celebration
[2070.02 → 2073.02] Where people would dance all night
[2073.02 → 2075.02] And they would sing loudly together
[2075.02 → 2077.02] And there was this priestly orchestra
[2077.02 → 2079.02] That would really kind of shake loose
[2079.02 → 2080.02] And play music
[2081.02 → 2083.02] And it was just this party
[2083.02 → 2084.02] That was the height of joy
[2085.02 → 2087.02] In a way that was unmatched
[2087.02 → 2088.02] In the entire Jewish calendar
[2089.02 → 2091.02] Now spiritually speaking
[2091.02 → 2094.02] It's recalling for the Israelites
[2094.02 → 2095.02] This important time
[2095.02 → 2097.02] When God led his people
[2098.02 → 2099.02] With a pillar of fire
[2100.02 → 2102.02] You know when they were wandering in the desert
[2102.02 → 2103.02] They were led at night
[2104.02 → 2105.02] Or in the day by a cloud
[2106.02 → 2107.02] A pillar of cloud
[2107.02 → 2108.02] And at night with this pillar of fire
[2109.02 → 2110.02] And that pillar of fire
[2111.02 → 2113.02] Was a light to them in the darkness
[2114.02 → 2117.02] And they lit these little pillars of fire
[2117.02 → 2118.02] Now to remind themselves
[2118.02 → 2121.02] That God had been a light to them
[2122.02 → 2123.02] When everything else was dark
[2124.02 → 2126.02] And as they danced around
[2127.02 → 2128.02] This flaming light in the temple
[2129.02 → 2130.02] They celebrated God
[2130.02 → 2131.02] They praised God
[2132.02 → 2133.02] Who is the greatest of all lights
[2134.02 → 2135.02] That he had one time
[2136.02 → 2137.02] Shown up in their midst
[2138.02 → 2139.02] And led them
[2140.02 → 2142.02] So it was the last night
[2143.02 → 2144.02] Of the feast of tabernacles
[2144.02 → 2146.02] When the fire is put out
[2147.02 → 2148.02] The celebration is over
[2149.02 → 2151.02] And for everyone
[2152.02 → 2153.02] As you can imagine
[2153.02 → 2154.02] There was a sense of sadness
[2155.02 → 2157.02] Sort of like when you take down the Christmas tree
[2158.02 → 2159.02] At the end of Christmas
[2160.02 → 2161.02] And for Israel
[2162.02 → 2164.02] The extinguished fires
[2165.02 → 2166.02] The extinguished lamps
[2167.02 → 2168.02] Were more weighty than that
[2169.02 → 2170.02] Because God's presence
[2171.02 → 2172.02] Hadn't been with the people
[2172.02 → 2173.02] For hundreds of years
[2173.02 → 2176.02] Because of their sin and rebellion
[2177.02 → 2178.02] The Israelites had been led into exile
[2179.02 → 2180.02] And God's presence
[2181.02 → 2182.02] It says left the temple
[2183.02 → 2186.02] And now only a small remnant of people
[2187.02 → 2188.02] Had returned to Jerusalem
[2189.02 → 2192.02] So imagine it's the last night of the festival
[2193.02 → 2195.02] They had just had these great celebrations
[2196.02 → 2197.02] Of exuberant joy
[2198.02 → 2199.02] But now it's all over
[2199.02 → 2200.02] And the people are sad
[2200.02 → 2201.02] And they're thinking
[2202.02 → 2203.02] Where is God?
[2204.02 → 2205.02] Right?
[2205.02 → 2207.02] When will he come again?
[2208.02 → 2210.02] And on that last night
[2211.02 → 2212.02] In all likelihood
[2213.02 → 2214.02] Jesus stood up
[2215.02 → 2217.02] Right under those four giant lamps
[2218.02 → 2219.02] Where the people had remembered
[2220.02 → 2221.02] That God had been their light
[2222.02 → 2223.02] And he said
[2224.02 → 2225.02] I am the light of the world
[2225.02 → 2226.02] In the world
[2227.02 → 2228.02] It's a phrase that is full
[2229.02 → 2230.02] Of tremendous significance
[2231.02 → 2232.02] For the Israelites
[2233.02 → 2234.02] But also for us
[2235.02 → 2238.02] And so in this phrase that Jesus says
[2239.02 → 2240.02] Right?
[2241.02 → 2242.02] And then in this acted out parable
[2243.02 → 2244.02] That he does
[2245.02 → 2246.02] That we read
[2247.02 → 2248.02] I want to look at three things this morning
[2249.02 → 2250.02] Firstly, what does it mean that Jesus is the light?
[2250.02 → 2251.02] And that he reveals the light?
[2251.02 → 2252.02] And then secondly
[2253.02 → 2255.02] I want to look at our response to the light
[2256.02 → 2257.02] And then finally
[2257.02 → 2259.02] What does it mean to reflect the light into the world?
[2260.02 → 2261.02] And so the first thing we're going to look at
[2262.02 → 2264.02] Is revealing the light
[2265.02 → 2266.02] What does it mean that Jesus is the light of the world?
[2267.02 → 2269.02] Well hopefully that introduction gave you
[2270.02 → 2272.02] A sense of the occasion
[2273.02 → 2274.02] Under which Jesus said this
[2275.02 → 2276.02] Right?
[2276.02 → 2277.02] He called himself the light of the world
[2277.02 → 2280.02] With this whole background of the festival of lights
[2281.02 → 2282.02] When they were remembering that God
[2283.02 → 2285.02] Had come to save his people and lead them
[2286.02 → 2288.02] So certainly Jesus, everything Jesus says here
[2289.02 → 2290.02] Is in that context
[2291.02 → 2294.02] And that is Jesus is identifying himself with all of that imagery
[2295.02 → 2296.02] But in addition to that
[2297.02 → 2298.02] There are three things that I want to highlight
[2299.02 → 2300.02] From Jesus' statement here
[2301.02 → 2302.02] And the first one
[2303.02 → 2304.02] Is that the light
[2304.02 → 2306.02] Is that Jesus says
[2306.02 → 2307.02] He is the light that was to come
[2307.02 → 2310.02] So if you go back to
[2311.02 → 2312.02] Isaiah 9
[2312.02 → 2313.02] Right?
[2313.02 → 2315.02] And that's the chapter that we often read around Christmas
[2316.02 → 2317.02] About the promised Messiah who was to come
[2318.02 → 2320.02] In verse 2 of Isaiah 9
[2321.02 → 2322.02] It says
[2322.02 → 2324.02] The people walking in darkness
[2325.02 → 2327.02] Have seen a great light
[2328.02 → 2329.02] On those living in the land
[2330.02 → 2331.02] Of deep darkness
[2332.02 → 2334.02] A light has dawned
[2335.02 → 2337.02] So Isaiah says that when the Messiah comes
[2338.02 → 2339.02] He is going to be this great light
[2340.02 → 2341.02] Shining into the darkness
[2342.02 → 2343.02] It's this light that will bring
[2344.02 → 2345.02] That very salvation of God
[2346.02 → 2347.02] To his people
[2348.02 → 2349.02] So by saying I am the light of the world
[2349.02 → 2351.02] I think Jesus is not just claiming to give some sort of
[2352.02 → 2353.02] Spiritual illumination
[2354.02 → 2356.02] He is laying claim to Isaiah 9
[2357.02 → 2358.02] And all of these other Old Testament prophecies
[2359.02 → 2363.02] That the light of God himself was going to come
[2364.02 → 2368.02] And so Jesus is this very light of God who has come
[2369.02 → 2370.02] And that's part of what it means
[2371.02 → 2372.02] That Jesus is the light of the world
[2373.02 → 2377.02] Secondly, he is the only light
[2377.02 → 2381.02] Right there, this is a point where grammar is
[2382.02 → 2383.02] Kind of becomes important
[2384.02 → 2385.02] Jesus uses the definite article
[2386.02 → 2388.02] He says I am the light
[2389.02 → 2390.02] Right?
[2391.02 → 2392.02] Which means he's saying I'm not
[2393.02 → 2394.02] A light among many
[2395.02 → 2397.02] Right? I'm not just one light
[2398.02 → 2399.02] Among others
[2400.02 → 2402.02] I'm not one bulb on a string of lights
[2403.02 → 2404.02] Or anything like that
[2404.02 → 2406.02] He is the whole light
[2407.02 → 2408.02] All by himself
[2409.02 → 2410.02] He is the only light
[2411.02 → 2413.02] You know, and this is contrary to the teachings of
[2414.02 → 2415.02] Basically all other religions
[2416.02 → 2418.02] Where they might say hey there are other teachers
[2419.02 → 2420.02] Other illuminators
[2421.02 → 2424.02] But Jesus says I am the only light
[2425.02 → 2429.02] And he himself says if you don't follow him
[2430.02 → 2431.02] You walk in darkness
[2431.02 → 2433.02] Right? There is only one way to see
[2434.02 → 2435.02] There is only one thing that can shine light
[2436.02 → 2437.02] On our path
[2438.02 → 2439.02] And that's Jesus
[2440.02 → 2443.02] So then the third thing we see him saying here
[2444.02 → 2445.02] Is that he is the light of the world
[2446.02 → 2449.02] And that Greek word for world is cosmos
[2450.02 → 2451.02] And this is a huge word
[2451.02 → 2456.02] It encompasses not just the world of the church
[2457.02 → 2458.02] Or the world of the Jews
[2459.02 → 2462.02] But it says Jesus functions as the light of the entire universe
[2463.02 → 2467.02] You know, and for think about the Jews wandering in the desert
[2468.02 → 2470.02] The light was only for them
[2471.02 → 2474.02] God led his people in a special way
[2474.02 → 2477.02] But when this light comes into the world
[2477.02 → 2478.02] In the person of Jesus
[2479.02 → 2481.02] This light is being offered much more widely
[2482.02 → 2484.02] Right? Now the whole world is included
[2485.02 → 2486.02] And Jesus is saying anyone
[2487.02 → 2489.02] You know, from any tribe or nation or language
[2490.02 → 2491.02] Or people group
[2492.02 → 2495.02] He says I have come to be a light to the entire world
[2496.02 → 2499.02] You know, the lamps that they lit during the festival
[2499.02 → 2501.02] Was just a foreshadowing
[2502.02 → 2504.02] Right? Those lamps lit up the city of Jerusalem
[2505.02 → 2506.02] And that was just a little taste
[2507.02 → 2508.02] Of the light that Jesus is
[2509.02 → 2511.02] That actually shines and shines out
[2512.02 → 2513.02] And floods into the entire world
[2514.02 → 2516.02] Okay, so those are a couple of things
[2517.02 → 2518.02] So we can get this idea of what it means
[2519.02 → 2520.02] That Jesus is the light
[2521.02 → 2522.02] That he is the only light
[2523.02 → 2525.02] That he is the light that was to come
[2526.02 → 2527.02] God himself
[2527.02 → 2528.02] And that he is the light for the entire world
[2529.02 → 2531.02] And this leads us into the second part
[2532.02 → 2533.02] That I want to talk about this morning
[2534.02 → 2535.02] Which is our response
[2536.02 → 2537.02] How are we to respond
[2538.02 → 2540.02] To Jesus as the light of the world?
[2541.02 → 2543.02] You know, the Gospel of John
[2544.02 → 2546.02] Is just full of these images of light
[2547.02 → 2549.02] So in John chapter 1 verse 9
[2550.02 → 2551.02] It tells us that Jesus
[2552.02 → 2554.02] Is the true light that was coming into the world
[2555.02 → 2557.02] But then in John chapter 3 verse 19
[2557.02 → 2558.02] Verse 19 it says
[2558.02 → 2560.02] Light has come into the world
[2560.02 → 2563.02] But people love the darkness instead of light
[2564.02 → 2565.02] Because their deeds were evil
[2566.02 → 2569.02] Right? So Jesus comes into the darkness of the world
[2570.02 → 2572.02] To be the light for the whole world
[2573.02 → 2574.02] But not everyone wants him
[2575.02 → 2576.02] Not everyone wants the light
[2577.02 → 2578.02] Or welcomes it
[2578.02 → 2579.02] And that's what we see
[2579.02 → 2581.02] In this response
[2582.02 → 2583.02] Of the Pharisees
[2584.02 → 2585.02] To Jesus' miracle
[2586.02 → 2587.02] Right? And so in John chapter 9
[2588.02 → 2589.02] We have this miracle
[2590.02 → 2591.02] Where Jesus heals the man who was born blind
[2592.02 → 2594.02] And not only is it a miracle
[2595.02 → 2596.02] But it's actually an illustration
[2597.02 → 2599.02] It's a parable of spiritual blindness
[2600.02 → 2601.02] And spiritual sight
[2602.02 → 2604.02] So Jesus is walking away from the temple
[2604.02 → 2606.02] Where he had just proclaimed that he is the light of the world
[2607.02 → 2608.02] And he comes out
[2609.02 → 2610.02] And he comes across a man
[2611.02 → 2612.02] Who was blind from birth
[2613.02 → 2615.02] And this man was likely sitting outside the temple
[2616.02 → 2618.02] And the man we read here is not partially blind
[2619.02 → 2621.02] It's not like he was growing older
[2622.02 → 2623.02] And kind of losing his sight
[2624.02 → 2625.02] He had been totally blind from birth
[2626.02 → 2627.02] And Jesus heals the man
[2628.02 → 2629.02] He makes some clay
[2630.02 → 2631.02] He rubs it on the man's eyes
[2632.02 → 2633.02] He says go wash in this pool
[2634.02 → 2635.02] And the man receives his sight
[2635.02 → 2636.02] It's a miracle
[2636.02 → 2637.02] Miraculous healing
[2638.02 → 2640.02] But how do the Pharisees respond?
[2641.02 → 2642.02] After Jesus heals the man
[2643.02 → 2644.02] The Pharisees come, and they confront Jesus
[2645.02 → 2647.02] And they say how can this be true?
[2648.02 → 2649.02] They're bitter, they're angry
[2650.02 → 2651.02] They're kind of yelling at everybody
[2652.02 → 2655.02] And they're like did you really heal him on the Sabbath?
[2656.02 → 2657.02] You can't do that, right?
[2657.02 → 2658.02] And that makes you a sinner
[2658.02 → 2660.02] Which means you can't be from God
[2661.02 → 2662.02] And so the irony
[2663.02 → 2664.02] Of this story
[2665.02 → 2666.02] Is that these religious leaders
[2667.02 → 2669.02] They claimed to see and know the truth
[2670.02 → 2672.02] But they show their blindness
[2673.02 → 2675.02] By refusing to accept the healing
[2676.02 → 2677.02] Right?
[2677.02 → 2678.02] They're hostile to Jesus
[2679.02 → 2682.02] They're upset that he has done this miracle
[2683.02 → 2685.02] And that their authority is being questioned
[2685.02 → 2688.02] And I think something that's really telling
[2689.02 → 2692.02] Is that they don't rejoice
[2693.02 → 2694.02] They don't praise God
[2695.02 → 2697.02] They don't marvel at this amazing thing
[2698.02 → 2700.02] That clearly God has done
[2701.02 → 2703.02] And at the very end of the story
[2704.02 → 2706.02] Jesus says that they are spiritually blind
[2707.02 → 2708.02] Right?
[2708.02 → 2711.02] They resist the light because of their darkness of unbelief
[2711.02 → 2716.02] So that's one way to respond to Jesus as the light
[2717.02 → 2718.02] Where we just refuse to listen
[2719.02 → 2721.02] We'd rather hold on to our own way of life
[2722.02 → 2723.02] Our own rules
[2724.02 → 2726.02] Our own supposed enlightenment that we think we have
[2727.02 → 2729.02] And we refuse Jesus
[2730.02 → 2733.02] But there's another response that we see in this passage
[2733.02 → 2736.02] And that's the response of the man who receives his sight
[2737.02 → 2738.02] Jesus heals him
[2739.02 → 2742.02] And brings him into the light of knowing who Jesus is
[2743.02 → 2745.02] And so the story also ends
[2746.02 → 2747.02] Not just with the Pharisees
[2748.02 → 2750.02] Being condemned for their spiritual blindness
[2751.02 → 2755.02] But with the man who understands that Jesus is the Messiah
[2756.02 → 2760.02] That Jesus is the only one who can take away our sin and our darkness
[2760.02 → 2766.02] And so friends, here's the question for us this morning
[2767.02 → 2768.02] Do you see?
[2769.02 → 2770.02] Okay, do you see?
[2771.02 → 2774.02] And we might ask, well, what does it mean to see?
[2775.02 → 2780.02] And by way of an answer, notice what happens when Jesus heals the man
[2781.02 → 2786.02] Notice that Jesus, you know, there aren't any conditions attached
[2786.02 → 2787.02] Right?
[2787.02 → 2790.02] Jesus doesn't demand conversion up front
[2791.02 → 2794.02] He doesn't ask for a show of faith in any way
[2795.02 → 2797.02] He doesn't even ask the guy if he wants to be healed
[2798.02 → 2799.02] He just heals him
[2800.02 → 2806.02] And friends, that's exactly what happens when Jesus heals us spiritually as well
[2807.02 → 2811.02] Right? The Gospel says that before we could respond to God in faith
[2812.02 → 2814.02] Before we could even do anything
[2814.02 → 2818.02] In other words, while we were blind from birth
[2819.02 → 2823.02] Jesus comes to us, and he lays his healing hands on us
[2824.02 → 2825.02] And he gives us spiritual sight
[2826.02 → 2827.02] To see who Jesus is
[2828.02 → 2830.02] And to receive the salvation that he offers
[2831.02 → 2834.02] Right? And friends, that is the grace and the mercy of the Gospel
[2835.02 → 2836.02] And of Jesus
[2836.02 → 2840.02] We have this verse from 2 Corinthians 4-6
[2841.02 → 2842.02] Where Paul says,
[2843.02 → 2847.02] For God, who said, let light shine out of darkness
[2848.02 → 2850.02] Made his light shine in our hearts
[2851.02 → 2853.02] To give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[2854.02 → 2856.02] Displayed in the face of Christ
[2856.02 → 2862.02] And so friends, this is something that God does through the work of the Holy Spirit
[2863.02 → 2865.02] Where he makes us alive in Christ
[2866.02 → 2869.02] And theologically, there's a term for this, it's called regeneration
[2870.02 → 2871.02] This is where the Holy Spirit
[2872.02 → 2875.02] While we were dead in our sin makes us alive in Christ
[2876.02 → 2879.02] While we were born blind, spiritually blind from birth
[2879.02 → 2880.02] He gives us spiritual sight
[2881.02 → 2883.02] That's what makes you a Christian
[2884.02 → 2886.02] You know, sometimes in the morning
[2887.02 → 2888.02] I have to wake up my boys
[2889.02 → 2891.02] To help them get out of bed and get ready for school
[2892.02 → 2893.02] They're actually doing a lot better
[2894.02 → 2896.02] But in recent years, I would have to go in
[2897.02 → 2898.02] And I'd kind of gently say
[2899.02 → 2900.02] It's time to wake up
[2901.02 → 2902.02] You know, very kind of gentle
[2903.02 → 2904.02] And what's the response?
[2905.02 → 2906.02] Nothing, just snoring
[2906.02 → 2908.02] Sound asleep
[2909.02 → 2910.02] Not stirred
[2911.02 → 2912.02] So then what do I do?
[2913.02 → 2914.02] Turn on the lights, right?
[2915.02 → 2917.02] So I lift the shades of the window
[2918.02 → 2919.02] I flick on the light
[2920.02 → 2921.02] And as soon as light comes on
[2922.02 → 2924.02] They're like, you know, writhing and screaming in agony
[2925.02 → 2926.02] But they jump out of bed
[2927.02 → 2929.02] Because light is rousing
[2930.02 → 2931.02] It wakes us up from our slumber
[2931.02 → 2934.02] And so this is one way you can know
[2935.02 → 2938.02] That you've received spiritual sight
[2939.02 → 2942.02] Is if in the same way you respond to Jesus
[2943.02 → 2945.02] By seeing who He is
[2946.02 → 2947.02] You know, the lights come on
[2948.02 → 2949.02] You see Jesus
[2950.02 → 2951.02] And you respond
[2952.02 → 2953.02] And what that means is
[2954.02 → 2955.02] That you see that He is the light
[2956.02 → 2957.02] That has come into the darkness to save you
[2958.02 → 2959.02] And it wakes you up
[2959.02 → 2960.02] And you see Jesus
[2960.02 → 2961.02] And you say, Lord, I believe
[2962.02 → 2964.02] And you jump up, and you run to Him
[2965.02 → 2968.02] Because Jesus is the light of life
[2969.02 → 2971.02] He is the light that brings life
[2972.02 → 2973.02] Spiritual life to people
[2974.02 → 2976.02] Okay, so that's how we can respond
[2977.02 → 2978.02] Do you see who Jesus is?
[2979.02 → 2982.02] And then friends, that leads us to the third point
[2983.02 → 2986.02] This morning, which is reflecting the light
[2987.02 → 2990.02] You know, I think an interesting question to ask is
[2991.02 → 2992.02] How can Jesus today
[2993.02 → 2994.02] Still be the light of the world?
[2995.02 → 2997.02] Because He's not here physically, is He?
[2998.02 → 2999.02] Right? He's not in our homes
[3000.02 → 3001.02] Or in our neighbourhoods
[3001.02 → 3002.02] Or in our workplaces
[3003.02 → 3004.02] He's ascended back to heaven
[3005.02 → 3006.02] At the right hand of the Father
[3007.02 → 3008.02] And the answer is
[3009.02 → 3010.02] That He is the light of the world
[3011.02 → 3012.02] Through His body, the church
[3012.02 → 3013.02] And He is not in our homes
[3013.02 → 3014.02] Because the church
[3014.02 → 3015.02] Because the church is given
[3015.02 → 3016.02] The same title as Him
[3017.02 → 3018.02] Jesus says
[3019.02 → 3020.02] I am the light of the world
[3021.02 → 3022.02] And Jesus also says
[3023.02 → 3024.02] You are the light of the world
[3025.02 → 3026.02] And so in Matthew 5
[3027.02 → 3028.02] In the Sermon on the Mount
[3029.02 → 3030.02] He says to His disciples
[3031.02 → 3032.02] We have the passage here
[3032.02 → 3033.02] He says
[3033.02 → 3034.02] You are the light of the world
[3035.02 → 3037.02] Let your light shine before others
[3038.02 → 3039.02] That they may see your good deeds
[3040.02 → 3041.02] And glorify your Father in heaven
[3042.02 → 3045.02] And so friends, the question for us is
[3046.02 → 3049.02] How can we reflect the light of Jesus in the world?
[3050.02 → 3053.02] And you know, there are lots of ways we can talk about that
[3053.02 → 3055.02] But in this passage
[3056.02 → 3057.02] We have an answer
[3057.02 → 3059.02] And I think we see this in chapter 9 verse 4
[3060.02 → 3062.02] And I think it's really practical for us
[3063.02 → 3064.02] So this is what it says
[3064.02 → 3065.02] As long as it is day
[3066.02 → 3068.02] We must do the works of Him who sent me
[3069.02 → 3071.02] Night is coming when no one can work
[3072.02 → 3076.02] And so notice Jesus uses a plural pronoun
[3077.02 → 3078.02] He says we
[3079.02 → 3080.02] We must do the works of Him
[3081.02 → 3082.02] That is God who sent me
[3082.02 → 3083.02] We
[3083.02 → 3085.02] Meaning that Jesus is calling us
[3086.02 → 3088.02] Jesus and us, His followers
[3088.02 → 3091.02] To participate in the work that God the Father
[3092.02 → 3093.02] Had sent Jesus to do
[3094.02 → 3096.02] So I think there are two principles that arise
[3097.02 → 3098.02] From what Jesus says
[3099.02 → 3100.02] About what we should do
[3101.02 → 3103.02] To reflect His light in the world
[3104.02 → 3105.02] And the first one
[3106.02 → 3107.02] That the thing we ought to do
[3108.02 → 3109.02] Is we ought to minister to those in need
[3110.02 → 3111.02] Just as Jesus did
[3112.02 → 3113.02] So Jesus and the disciples
[3113.02 → 3115.02] You know, they come across the man born blind
[3116.02 → 3118.02] And before Jesus can even say or do anything
[3119.02 → 3122.02] The disciples are busy in this theological debate
[3123.02 → 3125.02] They say, why is this man suffering?
[3125.02 → 3127.02] You know, what are the reasons for his blindness?
[3128.02 → 3131.02] And we don't have time to get into this whole question about suffering
[3132.02 → 3134.02] But part of Jesus' answer to them
[3134.02 → 3135.02] Is he says this
[3135.02 → 3141.02] This happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him
[3142.02 → 3145.02] And then Jesus immediately does the works of God
[3146.02 → 3149.02] Which is to alleviate suffering and bring healing to this man
[3150.02 → 3154.02] And so friends, that's the kind of works that we ought to be doing as well
[3154.02 → 3160.02] I think there's this really great passage in Proverbs chapter 3
[3160.02 → 3164.02] Which outlines a general principle that is helpful for us here
[3165.02 → 3168.02] It says, do not withhold good from those to whom it is due
[3169.02 → 3171.02] When it is in your power to act
[3172.02 → 3174.02] Do not say to your neighbour, come back tomorrow, and I'll give it to you
[3175.02 → 3176.02] When you already have it with you
[3176.02 → 3182.02] And so Proverbs suggests, and I think Jesus suggests by saying that we are to do the works of God
[3183.02 → 3187.02] That when you have the ability to do it, to do good
[3188.02 → 3189.02] We ought to do it, right?
[3189.02 → 3190.02] That's what Jesus does
[3191.02 → 3192.02] He had the ability to heal this man
[3193.02 → 3195.02] And he comes to him, and he heals him
[3196.02 → 3200.02] Now, do you have the ability to help every suffering person?
[3201.02 → 3203.02] The answer is no, of course not
[3203.02 → 3206.02] You do not have the ability to do that
[3206.02 → 3208.02] And so you also not need to feel the guilt of that
[3209.02 → 3212.02] Right? And Jesus didn't go around healing every blind person in Jerusalem
[3213.02 → 3215.02] He healed the one he came across
[3216.02 → 3219.02] And so the question is not if we should help
[3220.02 → 3222.02] It's just the question of who we should help
[3223.02 → 3224.02] So here's our question
[3225.02 → 3227.02] Who in your life needs help right now?
[3228.02 → 3229.02] Right? Who is suffering?
[3229.02 → 3233.02] Who could really use your support?
[3234.02 → 3236.02] And just start with someone
[3237.02 → 3238.02] Someone you already know
[3239.02 → 3241.02] You know, that's kind of one principle we see here
[3242.02 → 3243.02] Of how we can reflect the light of Christ
[3244.02 → 3245.02] Is to do the work of God
[3246.02 → 3247.02] But there's a second part of this principle
[3248.02 → 3249.02] A second principle
[3250.02 → 3252.02] That Jesus says that there is a time limit
[3253.02 → 3254.02] On our working
[3254.02 → 3256.02] He says right now it's day
[3256.02 → 3258.02] When you can do the works of God
[3259.02 → 3261.02] But eventually night is coming when no one can work
[3262.02 → 3264.02] Now Jesus uses night and day
[3265.02 → 3267.02] To refer to his own death on the cross
[3267.02 → 3268.02] The night that's coming
[3269.02 → 3270.02] But also the day
[3271.02 → 3272.02] This work that the Father has given him to do
[3273.02 → 3274.02] Of bringing salvation
[3275.02 → 3276.02] But it also refers
[3277.02 → 3279.02] And Paul and Peter referred to this in other passages
[3279.02 → 3282.02] It also refers to the time that each of us
[3283.02 → 3285.02] Have to do the work of God
[3286.02 → 3288.02] Which means that your opportunities are not endless
[3289.02 → 3291.02] The people who you can help
[3292.02 → 3294.02] Will not always be there in front of you
[3295.02 → 3297.02] Now I think it's so easy for me
[3298.02 → 3299.02] I think probably for all of us
[3300.02 → 3303.02] To put off doing the good that we know we can do
[3304.02 → 3306.02] To put off reflecting the light of Christ
[3306.02 → 3308.02] You know we're busy
[3309.02 → 3310.02] We're tired
[3310.02 → 3311.02] We say you know once I have more time
[3311.02 → 3312.02] Or once things kind of settle down
[3313.02 → 3314.02] In this other area of life
[3315.02 → 3317.02] Then I'll have that person over for dinner
[3318.02 → 3319.02] Or then I'll go visit this person
[3319.02 → 3320.02] Or I'll go serve in some way
[3321.02 → 3323.02] But friends I want to just encourage us
[3324.02 → 3325.02] To hear what Jesus is saying here
[3326.02 → 3328.02] In essence he says you don't have forever
[3329.02 → 3330.02] It's day right now
[3331.02 → 3332.02] And you can do something right now
[3333.02 → 3334.02] To help people see the light of Jesus
[3334.02 → 3338.02] Because as we do these works of God
[3339.02 → 3340.02] It says it glorifies God
[3341.02 → 3343.02] And it shows the light of Christ
[3344.02 → 3346.02] And friends the good news is that
[3347.02 → 3349.02] Jesus has poured out his spirit into our hearts
[3350.02 → 3352.02] Right he has awakened us to see him
[3353.02 → 3355.02] And he therefore also provides the means
[3356.02 → 3358.02] And the strength to follow him
[3359.02 → 3360.02] To walk in the light
[3360.02 → 3362.02] And to be the light of the world
[3362.02 → 3363.02] As he has called us to be
[3364.02 → 3365.02] And, so I pray this morning
[3366.02 → 3368.02] That you would receive Jesus
[3369.02 → 3370.02] As the light
[3371.02 → 3372.02] That you would respond to him in belief
[3373.02 → 3374.02] And that you would reflect his light
[3375.02 → 3376.02] In the world around you
[3377.02 → 3378.02] So let's pray together
[3381.02 → 3382.02] And Heavenly Father we pray
[3383.02 → 3384.02] Lord that
[3385.02 → 3386.02] Well Lord we praise you
[3386.02 → 3388.02] That you are the light of the world
[3389.02 → 3390.02] The light that has come
[3390.02 → 3391.02] And has shined into our darkness
[3392.02 → 3393.02] Not only the darkness of our own lives
[3394.02 → 3397.02] And in all the ways we feel the darkness
[3398.02 → 3399.02] But Lord into the darkness of this whole world
[3400.02 → 3402.02] And although you have ascended to the Father
[3403.02 → 3404.02] You have not left this world of darkness
[3405.02 → 3407.02] Because you have in Pentecost come
[3408.02 → 3410.02] Empowering your church by the Spirit
[3410.02 → 3414.02] To shine the light of Christ into the world
[3415.02 → 3416.02] Lord we pray that our neighbours
[3417.02 → 3418.02] Especially here in Delta and Lander
[3419.02 → 3421.02] Would see the light of this church community
[3422.02 → 3423.02] And that in
[3424.02 → 3425.02] As we do the works of God Lord
[3426.02 → 3427.02] That people would come to believe in Christ
[3428.02 → 3429.02] Lord would you help us
[3430.02 → 3431.02] And we pray in Jesus name
[3432.02 → 3433.02] Amen
[3434.02 → 3435.02] So let's sing our song of response together
[3435.02 → 3436.02] Let's sing our song of response together

[3587.36 → 3590.26] not only calls us in to worship him
[3590.26 → 3593.88] and feeds us by his word and praise and confession
[3593.88 → 3595.20] and all these things that we've done
[3595.20 → 3597.30] but he also sends us out
[3597.30 → 3599.38] and he sends us to be the light of the world
[3599.38 → 3601.88] and he sends us with his presence
[3601.88 → 3603.86] and with his blessing upon us
[3603.86 → 3606.32] So I invite you to hold out your hands
[3606.32 → 3610.82] just as a gesture of receiving this good word from the Father
[3610.82 → 3615.88] May God who said, let light shine out of darkness
[3615.88 → 3619.30] make his light shine in our hearts
[3619.30 → 3622.52] to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[3622.52 → 3625.42] in the face of our Lord Jesus Christ
