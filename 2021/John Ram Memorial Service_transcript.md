[0.00 --> 3.88]  When I see your face again
[3.88 --> 8.70]  But until then
[8.70 --> 12.94]  God must need another angel
[12.94 --> 16.50]  Around the throne tonight
[16.50 --> 21.26]  Your love lives on inside of me
[21.26 --> 24.30]  And I will hold on tight
[24.30 --> 28.46]  It's not my place to question
[28.46 --> 32.22]  Only God knows why
[32.22 --> 38.16]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[38.16 --> 41.82]  Around the throne tonight
[41.82 --> 48.74]  Singing hallelujah
[48.74 --> 52.70]  Hallelujah
[52.70 --> 58.46]  Hallelujah
[58.46 --> 62.40]  Hallelujah
[62.40 --> 70.40]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[70.40 --> 76.40]  Around the throne tonight
[76.40 --> 80.16]  Tonight
[80.16 --> 85.92]  Tell me what does it look like in heaven?
[85.92 --> 87.86]  Is it peaceful?
[87.86 --> 89.86]  Is it free?
[89.86 --> 91.86]  Like they say
[91.86 --> 101.56]  Does the sun shine bright forever?
[101.56 --> 105.62]  Have your fears and your pain gone away?
[105.62 --> 115.32]  Does the sun shine bright forever?
[115.32 --> 119.08]  And your pain gone away?
[119.08 --> 122.84]  Cause here on earth
[122.84 --> 124.84]  It feels like everything
[124.84 --> 128.78]  Good is the same
[128.78 --> 131.78]  Since you left
[131.78 --> 135.78]  And here on earth
[135.78 --> 137.78]  Everything's different
[137.78 --> 139.48]  There's an empty place
[139.48 --> 141.54]  There's an empty place
[141.54 --> 144.48]  Oh, I
[144.48 --> 151.48]  I hope you're dancing in the sky
[151.48 --> 157.18]  And I hope you're singing in the angels' light
[157.18 --> 164.18]  And I hope the angels know what they have
[164.18 --> 166.88]  I've made it so nice
[166.88 --> 167.88]  I've made it so nice
[167.88 --> 168.88]  I've made it so nice
[168.88 --> 170.88]  I've made it so nice
[170.88 --> 172.88]  Oh, in heaven
[172.88 --> 173.88]  Since you arrived
[173.88 --> 174.88]  So tell me
[174.88 --> 176.88]  What do you do
[176.88 --> 178.88]  In heaven
[178.88 --> 184.28]  All your days filled with love and light
[184.28 --> 190.82]  Is there music, is there art and invention
[190.82 --> 198.34]  Tell me are you happy, are you more alive
[198.34 --> 204.60]  Cause here on earth it feels like everything
[204.60 --> 211.50]  God has been saved since you left
[211.50 --> 217.20]  And here on earth everything's different
[217.20 --> 220.44]  There's an emptiness
[220.44 --> 230.88]  Oh, I hope you're dancing in the sky
[230.88 --> 237.78]  And I hope you're singing in the angels' light
[237.78 --> 244.22]  And I hope the angels know what they have
[244.22 --> 250.16]  I'll bet it's so nice up in heaven since you arrived
[250.16 --> 253.56]  Since you arrived
[253.56 --> 263.06]  Oh, I didn't look like you were
[263.06 --> 267.16]  Oh, I hope you're dancing in the sky
[267.16 --> 283.56]  Oh, I hope you're dancing in the sky
[283.56 --> 290.16]  And I hope you're singing in the angels' light
[290.16 --> 297.06]  And I hope the angels know what they have
[297.06 --> 302.76]  I'll bet it's so nice up in heaven since you arrived
[302.76 --> 306.06]  Since you arrived
[306.06 --> 309.36]  Do they look like an errand?
[310.86 --> 315.56]  Is it peaceful? Is it free like they say?
[315.56 --> 333.20]  I didn't know today would be our last
[333.20 --> 341.60]  That I'd have to say goodbye to you so fast
[341.60 --> 348.04]  I'm so numb I can't feel anymore
[348.04 --> 355.90]  I'm praying you'd just walk back through that door
[355.90 --> 363.40]  And tell me that I was only dreaming
[363.40 --> 370.70]  You're not really gone as long as I believe
[370.70 --> 376.90]  There will be another angel
[376.90 --> 380.58]  Around the throne tonight
[380.58 --> 385.38]  Your love lives on inside of me
[385.38 --> 388.38]  And I will hold on tight
[388.38 --> 392.48]  It's not my place to question
[392.48 --> 396.38]  Only God knows why
[396.38 --> 402.18]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[402.18 --> 405.98]  Around the throne tonight
[405.98 --> 421.78]  Always made my troubles feel so small
[421.78 --> 426.98]  And you were always there to catch me
[426.98 --> 429.78]  And I'd fall
[429.78 --> 438.58]  In a world where heroes come and go
[438.58 --> 445.58]  Where God just took the only one I know
[445.58 --> 453.58]  So I'll hold you as close as I can
[453.58 --> 456.38]  Longing for the day
[456.38 --> 461.38]  When I see your face again
[461.38 --> 466.38]  But until then
[466.38 --> 470.38]  God must need another angel
[470.38 --> 474.38]  Around the throne tonight
[474.38 --> 478.38]  Your love lives on inside of me
[478.38 --> 482.38]  And I will hold on tight
[482.38 --> 486.18]  It's not my place to question
[486.18 --> 490.18]  Only God knows why
[490.18 --> 495.18]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[495.18 --> 499.18]  Around the throne tonight
[499.18 --> 500.98]  Singing
[500.98 --> 501.98]  Singing
[501.98 --> 502.98]  Hallelujah
[502.98 --> 504.98]  Hallelujah
[504.98 --> 508.98]  Hallelujah
[508.98 --> 509.98]  Hallelujah
[509.98 --> 511.98]  Hallelujah
[511.98 --> 512.98]  Hallelujah
[512.98 --> 516.98]  Hallelujah
[516.98 --> 517.98]  Hallelujah
[517.98 --> 526.98]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[526.98 --> 528.78]  Around the angels
[528.78 --> 532.78]  Around the throne tonight
[532.78 --> 534.78]  Tonight
[534.78 --> 537.28]  Malloy
[542.46 --> 544.64]  Thank you
[544.64 --> 545.78]  verse 4
[545.78 --> 546.88]  I'm just jealous of the angels
[546.88 --> 549.10]  In this world
[549.10 --> 550.26]  I just love you
[550.26 --> 551.06]  For the angels
[551.06 --> 552.76]  bell
[552.76 --> 553.70]  Yes
[553.70 --> 554.70]  Because I beauty
[554.70 --> 555.86]  Or the angels
[555.86 --> 556.72]  I just love you
[556.72 --> 557.88]  But I love you
[557.88 --> 558.20]  ambitions
[558.58 --> 560.30]  as I love you
[560.30 --> 560.96]  So I love you
[561.28 --> 562.70]  And I love you
[562.70 --> 592.68]  Thank you.
[592.70 --> 622.68]  Thank you.
[622.70 --> 652.68]  Thank you.
[652.70 --> 682.68]  Thank you.
[682.70 --> 712.68]  Thank you.
[712.70 --> 715.26]  You may be seated.
[715.26 --> 721.42]  Good afternoon.
[721.42 --> 728.54]  On behalf of the family and in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I welcome you to this
[728.54 --> 732.38]  time where we are going to do a few things together.
[733.26 --> 736.56]  One is to celebrate the life of John Ram.
[736.56 --> 745.14]  We will celebrate some of our memories of him that have been so special to us in terms of
[745.14 --> 746.42]  what he has meant to us.
[746.42 --> 755.56]  We're also going to celebrate the gift of God, his father.
[755.56 --> 759.64]  But we're also going to be grieving.
[759.64 --> 765.82]  We're going to be remembering John, but we're going to be feeling the loss and the absence
[765.82 --> 767.64]  and feeling the grief of that.
[768.92 --> 775.54]  And so we want to come together in this time to support one another and to look to the Lord
[775.54 --> 782.52]  together for his comfort that he would meet us, each one of us, where we are this morning.
[782.52 --> 791.42]  So hear now some of God's words to us which bring that comfort and that hope that we celebrate today.
[791.42 --> 801.96]  For none of us lives for ourselves alone and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
[802.38 --> 805.42]  If we live, we live for the Lord.
[806.10 --> 808.74]  And if we die, we die for the Lord.
[809.46 --> 813.98]  So whether we live or whether we die, we belong to the Lord.
[813.98 --> 820.98]  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[821.90 --> 830.10]  In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[830.10 --> 835.54]  and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[836.30 --> 839.78]  This inheritance is kept in heaven for you.
[839.78 --> 845.44]  And Jesus said these amazing words.
[846.06 --> 848.64]  He said, I am the resurrection and the life.
[849.62 --> 854.26]  He who believes in me will live even though he dies.
[855.30 --> 859.00]  And whoever lives and believes in me will never die.
[860.34 --> 862.20]  Would you pray with me?
[862.20 --> 874.70]  Father, we thank you this afternoon that we can come to you and place our hopes squarely in Jesus Christ.
[875.44 --> 881.78]  We thank you for what he has done for us on the cross to bring forgiveness of our sins
[881.78 --> 887.48]  and grant us resurrection to eternal life as a gift by your grace.
[887.48 --> 917.46]  We thank you for God.
[917.46 --> 947.44]  We thank you for God.
[947.44 --> 949.20]  And we will sing Amazing Grace.
[949.30 --> 953.22]  And the words will be on the screen here so you can sing along.
[953.22 --> 955.22]  Amen.
[955.22 --> 956.22]  Amen.
[956.22 --> 956.72]  Amen.
[956.72 --> 957.08]  Amen.
[957.08 --> 958.70]  Amen.
[958.76 --> 958.96]  Amen.
[958.96 --> 959.06]  Amen.
[959.06 --> 960.22]  Amen.
[960.82 --> 960.86]  Amen.
[960.86 --> 961.48]  Amen.
[961.48 --> 962.58]  Amen.
[965.08 --> 966.00]  Amen.
[966.00 --> 966.68]  Amen.
[966.68 --> 979.48]  Amen.
[979.48 --> 984.48]  The King of Wrenching Me
[984.48 --> 989.66]  I was, I was, I was
[989.66 --> 993.48]  But now I am done
[993.48 --> 1000.48]  The fire of the man of my sea
[1000.48 --> 1008.48]  The streets have torn my heart
[1008.48 --> 1015.48]  To live and raise my fears
[1015.48 --> 1022.48]  Believe the wretchedness
[1022.48 --> 1027.48]  And praise of me
[1027.48 --> 1033.48]  Be done and hurt me
[1033.48 --> 1042.48]  The Lord that's promised
[1042.48 --> 1047.48]  Good to give His Word
[1047.48 --> 1062.48]  He will my shield and portion be
[1062.48 --> 1069.48]  As long as I can do
[1069.48 --> 1079.48]  Through many nations' broken
[1079.48 --> 1094.48]  to rain
[1094.48 --> 1106.86]  He saved us all, and praise will be the Lord.
[1124.48 --> 1126.48]  Amen.
[1154.48 --> 1171.12]  We know that we will sing our praise, and let the words be done.
[1175.08 --> 1177.70]  Please be seated.
[1177.70 --> 1178.70]  Amen.
[1183.56 --> 1191.26]  It is good during this time to really remember, to remember John and what he means to each
[1191.26 --> 1191.68]  of us.
[1192.22 --> 1197.54]  And so we're going to have the family, Annette and Jonathan, come up and share some words
[1197.54 --> 1198.00]  of remembrance.
[1207.70 --> 1219.68]  So I've been thinking and asking myself over the last couple of days, what is today all
[1219.68 --> 1220.02]  about?
[1220.64 --> 1226.14]  It's difficult trying to find the right words and stories to celebrate my wonderful dad.
[1226.14 --> 1233.68]  He was kind, gentle, loving, supportive father and husband, who always had a huge smile on
[1233.68 --> 1239.66]  his face and a warm hug for those dear to him, and always happy to help anyone.
[1241.32 --> 1243.84]  Our family meant the world to my dad.
[1243.84 --> 1249.70]  He was the most happiest around the dinner table, full of family, sitting around chatting,
[1250.20 --> 1256.66]  eating good food, drinking wine, and even having a cold beer, reminiscing about old times.
[1257.66 --> 1266.78]  As our father grew, so did the tables, with spouses, grandchildren, their spouses, and eventually
[1266.78 --> 1269.96]  Hadley, dad's first great-grandchild.
[1269.96 --> 1275.36]  All of dad's children and grandchildren were the joy of his life.
[1275.78 --> 1277.90]  He was proud of each and every one of us.
[1278.98 --> 1284.72]  In the past couple of years, dad also enjoyed the peace and quiet after everyone left.
[1286.48 --> 1289.00]  Hadley had a special place in dad's heart.
[1289.58 --> 1292.58]  It created joy for him over the last two years.
[1293.30 --> 1295.26]  They had a very special relationship.
[1295.78 --> 1297.28]  Papa was a quiet man.
[1297.92 --> 1299.64]  Hadley loved that most about him.
[1299.96 --> 1305.62]  She would tuck him in with her little blankets while he was sitting quietly to make him so cozy.
[1306.62 --> 1311.32]  Each time Hadley was given a treat, she made sure she was given two.
[1311.92 --> 1314.12]  One for her and one for her papa.
[1315.10 --> 1316.78]  So Brittany, reminder, okay?
[1318.56 --> 1321.26]  Growing up as a family, we had many adventures.
[1321.92 --> 1325.94]  But one that stands out most to us was a road trip to Disneyland.
[1325.94 --> 1331.60]  We went as a convoy with the Swans and Uncle Drew and his family.
[1331.60 --> 1338.26]  Driving through Seattle, towing a trailer was probably the most nerve-wracking thing my father has ever done.
[1338.26 --> 1339.26]  But he did it.
[1339.26 --> 1344.26]  It's a memory us kids will never forget and still talk about today.
[1344.26 --> 1350.26]  Dad was a plumber by trade and could fix most anything.
[1350.26 --> 1355.92]  He did a bit of woodworking, building shelves, shoe racks for all of us.
[1355.92 --> 1357.92]  And dad was always there if he needed help.
[1357.92 --> 1363.62]  He left to collect oddball parts just in case one day somebody needed something.
[1363.62 --> 1373.72]  As each of us kids slowly moved out of the family home, he would be there with a toolbox in one hand and a paint roller in the other.
[1374.36 --> 1379.38]  He's painted every one of our homes and unplugged many a toilet and sink.
[1381.96 --> 1385.30]  Dad was also the neighborhood lawn and maintenance guy.
[1385.74 --> 1391.08]  He was reliable, dependable, and he would watch the neighbors' homes when they went on holidays.
[1391.08 --> 1401.08]  Taking in their mail, mowing their lawns, he always took time to turn on the furnace or open up the windows for fresh air when it was warm before they came home.
[1401.08 --> 1403.18]  That's how dad was.
[1403.18 --> 1405.58]  He took pride in everything he did.
[1405.58 --> 1408.68]  He was kind, caring, considerate.
[1408.68 --> 1411.92]  Not just to his family, but everyone that knew him.
[1411.92 --> 1418.88]  He also sat on the maintenance committee of the church and school.
[1418.88 --> 1425.38]  He would sometimes get a call on Saturday as there was a plumbing issue at the church and off we would go.
[1425.38 --> 1428.18]  Never a grumble, just happy he could help.
[1428.18 --> 1432.08]  I would sometimes go with him.
[1432.08 --> 1438.48]  When we were done fixing whatever needed to be fixed, there'd be one more thing to do before we went home.
[1438.48 --> 1441.48]  Dad had to play the organ.
[1441.48 --> 1447.98]  He just loved to turn it on, hearing the wind whistle through the pipes.
[1447.98 --> 1457.48]  I would watch his feet swing over the pedals, back and forth, and his fingers would pounce over the keys.
[1457.48 --> 1459.98]  He truly was in his happy place.
[1459.98 --> 1464.48]  He loved playing the organ and the sound it made.
[1464.48 --> 1470.98]  We also had a smaller organ at home, and when dad was bored, restless, or just needed to chill out,
[1470.98 --> 1476.48]  he would put on his headphones and all we could hear was his fingers tapping on the keys.
[1476.48 --> 1482.98]  What I wouldn't do to hear the tapping, or just to see my dad in his happy place one more time.
[1482.98 --> 1490.48]  Dad became sick in January and was finally diagnosed with cancer.
[1490.48 --> 1494.98]  He didn't remember his first two months of chemo, as he was so sick.
[1494.98 --> 1500.98]  But he perked up for a little while, only to become sick again by the end of March.
[1500.98 --> 1502.98]  He spent 20 days in the hospital.
[1502.98 --> 1509.98]  It was really especially tough on all of us and him, as we were unable to be with him in person.
[1509.98 --> 1516.48]  He battled cancer, pneumonia, heart and kidney failure during the last six months.
[1516.48 --> 1524.48]  He taught us as a family to face adversity with strength, courage, positive, and grace.
[1524.48 --> 1527.48]  Thank you, Dad, for a final life lesson.
[1529.98 --> 1534.48]  Dad's last week of life was truly blessed.
[1534.48 --> 1541.98]  On Monday before he passed away, he was out for lunch, a little family reunion with Mom and her siblings,
[1541.98 --> 1545.98]  as some had not seen each other in over a year and a half.
[1545.98 --> 1552.98]  A gentleman beside them overheard the conversation, witnessed their hugs, their tears, and their birthday wishes to Uncle Ep.
[1552.98 --> 1557.48]  This gentleman graciously paid for everyone's lunch.
[1557.48 --> 1559.48]  Dad was amazed and honoured.
[1559.48 --> 1563.48]  And by this, and he couldn't wait to tell me when he arrived home.
[1563.48 --> 1565.48]  He was so excited.
[1565.48 --> 1570.48]  I was so glad he experienced such generosity from complete stranger.
[1570.48 --> 1573.48]  It filled his last days with joy and happiness.
[1573.48 --> 1577.98]  The following Wednesday, we went to Dad's doctor.
[1577.98 --> 1582.98]  It was the best doctor's report we had received since the beginning of his illness.
[1582.98 --> 1586.98]  He was finally reacting to the chemo and there were signs of improvement.
[1586.98 --> 1591.98]  On Thursday, Hadley was over for lunch.
[1591.98 --> 1597.98]  We had Dad's favourite white spot burgers, which Dad really enjoyed, along with the time he spent with Hadley.
[1597.98 --> 1609.48]  Unfortunately, that Friday, Dad took a downward turn and was admitted into hospital and passed into glory Saturday, July 31st.
[1609.48 --> 1613.48]  Dad's final days were filled with so many blessings.
[1613.48 --> 1621.48]  We cannot say enough for the excellent care he received from all the medical staff that were there for him when we couldn't.
[1621.48 --> 1632.98]  I felt truly supported by all the doctors, nurses that supported Dad and I as I helped him navigate the last six months through chemo and hospital stays.
[1632.98 --> 1639.98]  Despite the struggle that faced my Dad, unselfishly, he always thought of others.
[1639.98 --> 1646.48]  He always wanted to show gratitude to the staff and would say when I picked him up after a hospital stay,
[1646.48 --> 1649.48]  make sure you thank them, Manette.
[1649.48 --> 1654.48]  Fruit and treats were shared as an expression of our gratitude.
[1654.48 --> 1661.48]  I would like to thank everyone that stood by us and supported us through this difficult time,
[1661.48 --> 1664.48]  especially PJ and her family.
[1664.48 --> 1666.48]  I don't know where you are.
[1666.48 --> 1668.98]  There, okay.
[1668.98 --> 1671.98]  You supported, without your support and generosity,
[1671.98 --> 1676.98]  I would have been able to dedicate the last six months to caring for my Dad.
[1676.98 --> 1679.98]  I am truly blessed and thank you very much.
[1679.98 --> 1682.98]  Today, we celebrate you, Dad.
[1682.98 --> 1687.98]  We remember the fun times, the happy and sad times, and cherish you.
[1687.98 --> 1689.98]  We will miss you dearly.
[1689.98 --> 1692.98]  That's it, thank you.
[1692.98 --> 1708.48]  We'll stand again.
[1708.48 --> 1712.48]  And we'll sing another hymn, How Great Thou Art.
[1712.48 --> 1714.48]  Amen.
[1742.48 --> 1744.48]  Amen.
[1772.48 --> 1774.48]  Amen.
[1802.48 --> 1804.48]  Amen.
[1832.48 --> 1834.48]  Amen.
[1862.48 --> 1864.48]  Amen.
[1892.48 --> 1894.48]  Amen.
[1922.48 --> 1924.48]  Amen.
[1952.48 --> 1954.48]  Amen.
[1982.48 --> 1984.48]  Amen.
[1984.48 --> 1985.48]  Amen.
[1985.48 --> 1986.48]  Amen.
[1986.48 --> 1987.48]  Amen.
[1987.48 --> 1991.48]  Thank you, Annette and Jonathan, for those words.
[1991.48 --> 1998.48]  Experiencing the death of someone that we love, feeling the loss of that person's presence,
[1998.48 --> 2000.48]  is really, really difficult.
[2000.48 --> 2006.88]  And to have heard, even just now, the impact that John had on his family's life and on many
[2006.88 --> 2011.48]  of our lives, you know, we're going to miss that impact.
[2011.48 --> 2012.48]  Right?
[2012.48 --> 2020.48]  We're going to miss that friendship, that companionship, that strength of character that all who know
[2020.48 --> 2022.48]  him loved about John.
[2022.48 --> 2029.48]  And not only do we miss John, but we can ask lots of questions at a time like this.
[2029.48 --> 2036.48]  And one of those questions can be, is this life all there is?
[2036.48 --> 2041.48]  And wonderfully, we celebrate in this time together that, no, it's not.
[2041.48 --> 2045.48]  There is life eternal that John has now entered into.
[2045.48 --> 2049.48]  And that awaits all of us who trust in Christ.
[2049.48 --> 2059.48]  The words of the Apostle Paul, we will be reading now from John chapter one.
[2059.48 --> 2062.48]  And I'll just read verses 21 to 23.
[2062.48 --> 2063.48]  1st verse 22.

[2084.48 --> 2085.48]  11.
[2085.48 --> 2087.48]  11.
[2087.48 --> 2088.48]  11.
[2088.48 --> 2098.26]  God's word. These words from the Apostle Paul are a wonderful reminder to us. It's a wonderful
[2098.26 --> 2105.56]  passage for us to ponder for a few moments. To consider what Paul says there, where he says,
[2105.66 --> 2115.24]  I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far. This is the verse that Janet was
[2115.24 --> 2122.54]  reading in her devotions the day that John went home to be, went home to glory. So Janet felt that
[2122.54 --> 2127.94]  it would be very meaningful for us together to read this passage, to understand what John is
[2127.94 --> 2137.18]  experiencing right now, and then also what awaits all of us as well. Paul writes again, I desire to
[2137.18 --> 2147.54]  depart and be with Christ, which is far better. But brothers and sisters, people didn't always used
[2147.54 --> 2158.24]  to think that way. It used to be that death was the dreaded end of life and the door into the unknown.
[2159.54 --> 2166.58]  It used to be that death of a loved one caused great sorrow and weeping because there was no hope that
[2166.58 --> 2173.96]  we would ever be with them again. All of that changed. However, one early morning when several
[2173.96 --> 2181.18]  women went to the tomb where their beloved friend had been buried just three days before.
[2182.18 --> 2190.02]  And they went with tears in their eyes and with spices in their hands to mourn and to anoint
[2190.02 --> 2198.58]  the body of Jesus. But when they arrived, they found the stone that had covered the grave to have been
[2198.58 --> 2206.24]  rolled aside. And two angels, grinning from ear to ear, said to them, why do you look for the living
[2206.24 --> 2217.00]  among the dead? He is not here. He is risen. And ever since that day, Christians have never looked at death
[2217.00 --> 2227.02]  the same way again. We know now for certain that there is a fullness of life after death because Jesus
[2227.02 --> 2238.50]  Christ is risen from the dead. And friends, that's why Paul is able to say to die is gain. It's not to die
[2238.50 --> 2247.86]  is nothing, but to die is gain. To depart and be with Christ is far better. Right? And so as much as we love
[2247.86 --> 2254.30]  this life that God has given us, the time that we have with friends and family, being with Christ is far
[2254.30 --> 2261.54]  better. As much as we delight in the many joys and pleasures of life in this world, to be with Christ is
[2261.54 --> 2269.92]  much better. It's not simply a continuation of this life, but it's a life of glory. It's a life that's full
[2269.92 --> 2278.24]  of far more greatness. Right? And all the best qualities of life that we enjoy right now. And when
[2278.24 --> 2284.48]  we think about John, all the great conversations and the chats that many of us have had with him,
[2284.48 --> 2293.34]  they will be immeasurably more and greater. The best sense of love and acceptance and friendship
[2293.34 --> 2300.60]  that we experience in relationship with John now is just going to be multiplied.
[2302.00 --> 2307.80]  That is the joy that we know he is experiencing now and that we look forward to as we put our faith
[2307.80 --> 2315.72]  in Christ. In another letter that Paul wrote, he says this, we do not grieve like the rest of people
[2315.72 --> 2323.72]  who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again. And so we believe that God will bring
[2323.72 --> 2335.22]  with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. So as Annette already shared with us on Saturday, July 31st,
[2335.22 --> 2342.96]  John Ram fell asleep in Jesus. And just as surely friends that you and I are here today,
[2343.80 --> 2351.86]  just as surely John now is with Christ. And that means friends that all of the sorrow and sadness
[2351.86 --> 2360.48]  that we have at the loss of a husband, of a father, of a grandfather, a friend, a brother in Christ,
[2360.48 --> 2368.96]  it finds immense comfort in the certainty of God's promise that whoever declares with their mouth that
[2368.96 --> 2374.82]  Jesus is Lord and whoever believes in their heart that God raised Jesus from the dead will be saved.
[2376.92 --> 2386.54]  And Jesus wants to tell each of us today that life that is far greater awaits us as we put our faith
[2386.54 --> 2396.36]  in Jesus Christ. He's taken away our sin. He's given us his grace and his forgiveness. And he promises a
[2396.36 --> 2403.68]  life of glory that outlives our our personal presence and experience now. And that is the hope that we all
[2403.68 --> 2410.82]  long for. That is the hope that we all look forward to. And so friends, may that hope that we have in Jesus
[2410.82 --> 2415.88]  Christ be our comfort today. Amen. Would you please pray with me?
[2419.14 --> 2423.32]  Lord Jesus, we thank you for this incredible hope that you have given to us.
[2424.12 --> 2431.72]  That you are the one who has secured that better future for us. Life that doesn't just end at death,
[2431.80 --> 2436.78]  but gets even better because we will be in the glory of your presence.
[2436.78 --> 2441.96]  And we rejoice and give you thanks for that promise and for that gift.
[2443.10 --> 2446.06]  For John, as well as for those who believe in you.
[2446.82 --> 2453.50]  We thank you that you have given, or that you have brought John home into the warmth of your loving
[2453.50 --> 2460.28]  embrace and into the fullness of life that you have created for each one of us to know and experience.
[2460.28 --> 2469.28]  And we await that day, Lord, in hope and in trust until we also are reunited with those we love, with John and with others.
[2469.90 --> 2475.78]  And that we also can dwell in your presence for which you have created each one of us to do.
[2476.36 --> 2478.96]  We ask that you would comfort each of us now who miss him.
[2479.74 --> 2482.12]  And also, Lord, would you comfort us,
[2482.96 --> 2486.44]  John's family and friends and loved ones in the days ahead.
[2486.44 --> 2492.30]  We look to you for these things and we ask it all in the name of our Savior.
[2493.46 --> 2493.90]  Amen.
[2497.50 --> 2500.40]  So let's sing one final song together.

[2692.14 --> 2704.14]  I'll sing in the river, my crown on my crown,
[2704.14 --> 2718.14]  If ever I love Thee, my Jesus is Thou.
[2718.14 --> 2728.14]  Would you please remain standing and join me in a final closing prayer.
[2728.14 --> 2731.14]  Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
[2731.14 --> 2735.14]  You are our refuge and strength in times of trouble.
[2735.14 --> 2741.14]  You are the light in the darkness that we face.
[2741.14 --> 2745.14]  And you are our only hope in the valley of the shadow of death.
[2745.14 --> 2748.14]  Lord, would you comfort us in our loss and sorrow,
[2748.14 --> 2752.14]  And lift us up into the peace and light of your presence.
[2752.14 --> 2758.14]  Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by dying has destroyed our death,
[2758.14 --> 2762.14]  And by rising has restored life.
[2762.14 --> 2768.14]  Make us confident that because He lives, we shall also live.
[2768.14 --> 2772.14]  Immerse us now in the love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,
[2772.14 --> 2777.14]  Who lives with you in the Holy Spirit, one God, both now and forever.
[2777.14 --> 2778.14]  Amen.
[2778.14 --> 2785.14]  So following the benediction, we will sing one last song.
[2785.14 --> 2790.14]  Then I will invite you to be seated and our ushers will dismiss you.
[2790.14 --> 2797.14]  And afterward there's a time of fellowship in the hall that is through the doors behind you.
[2797.14 --> 2801.14]  So receive God's blessing upon you now.
[2801.14 --> 2805.14]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[2805.14 --> 2809.14]  The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[2809.14 --> 2814.14]  And the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
