[654.48 → 662.48] I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
[662.48 → 670.48] Thy path throughout the universe displayed
[670.48 → 678.48] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[678.48 → 684.48] How great Thou art
[684.48 → 686.48] How great Thou art
[686.48 → 694.48] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[694.48 → 698.48] How great Thou art
[698.48 → 706.48] How great Thou art
[706.48 → 708.48] But when I think
[708.48 → 714.48] That God His Son not sparing
[714.48 → 716.48] Sent Him to die
[716.48 → 722.48] I scarce can take it in
[722.48 → 726.48] That on the cross
[726.48 → 730.48] My burden gladly bearing
[730.48 → 734.48] He bled and died
[734.48 → 736.48] To take away my sin
[736.48 → 738.48] To take away my sin
[738.48 → 740.48] To take away my sin
[740.48 → 744.48] And sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee

[784.48 → 786.48] And take me home
[786.48 → 790.48] When joy shall fill my heart
[790.48 → 794.48] Then I shall bow
[794.48 → 798.48] In humble adoration
[798.48 → 802.48] And there proclaim
[802.48 → 806.48] My God how great Thou art
[806.48 → 808.48] How great Thou art

[865.94 → 877.78] We will feast in the house of Zion
[877.78 → 882.92] We will sing with our hearts restored
[882.92 → 888.14] He has done great things we will say together
[888.14 → 894.14] We will feast and weep no more
[894.14 → 901.92] We will not be burned by the fire
[901.92 → 906.14] He is the Lord our God
[906.94 → 912.14] We are not consumed by the flood
[912.14 → 919.14] Of hell protected gathered
[919.14 → 924.14] We will feast in the house of Zion
[924.74 → 929.14] We will sing with our hearts restored
[929.66 → 934.14] He has done great things we will say together
[934.82 → 940.14] We will feast and weep no more
[940.14 → 945.14] In the dark of night
[945.90 → 948.14] Before the dawn
[948.14 → 952.14] My soul be not afraid
[952.14 → 956.14] For the promised morning
[956.14 → 958.14] Oh how long
[958.14 → 961.14] Oh God, oh Jake
[961.14 → 964.14] Help me my strength
[964.14 → 969.60] We will feast in the house of Zion
[970.14 → 973.88] We will sing with our hearts restored
[974.14 → 979.14] He has done great things we will say together
[980.14 → 985.14] We will feast and weep no more
[985.14 → 986.64] One.
[989.26 → 999.36] Every vow we've broken and betrayed, you are the faithful one.
[999.36 → 1010.22] And from the garden to the grave, bind us together, bring shalom.
[1010.22 → 1022.22] We will feast in the house of Zion, we will sing with our hearts restored.
[1022.22 → 1033.22] He has done great things, we will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[1033.22 → 1043.22] We will feast in the house of Zion, we will sing with our hearts restored.
[1043.22 → 1054.22] He has done great things, we will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[1054.22 → 1061.22] We will feast and weep no more.
[1069.22 → 1071.22] We come now to a time of confession.
[1071.22 → 1075.22] And today we will use the words of Psalm 130.
[1075.22 → 1082.22] Please read with me and confess with thee the words that are in bold.
[1082.22 → 1088.22] Out of the depths, we cry to you, O Lord.
[1088.22 → 1090.22] Lord, hear our voice.
[1090.22 → 1096.22] Let your ears be attentive to the voice of our supplications.
[1096.22 → 1102.22] If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?
[1102.22 → 1107.22] But with you there is forgiveness, so that you may be revered.
[1107.22 → 1111.22] Now in the church, hope in the Lord.
[1111.22 → 1117.22] For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is great power to redeem.
[1117.22 → 1124.22] It is he who will redeem us from all our iniquities.
[1124.22 → 1125.22] Amen.
[1125.22 → 1135.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1135.22 → 1142.22] Where does my help come from?
[1142.22 → 1148.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1148.22 → 1154.22] Where does my help come from?
[1154.22 → 1166.22] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1166.22 → 1169.22] Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1169.22 → 1173.22] You are my only hope.
[1173.22 → 1178.22] You're my only prayer.
[1178.22 → 1183.22] So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[1183.22 → 1190.22] Come and give me life.
[1190.22 → 1197.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1197.22 → 1202.22] Where does my help come from?
[1202.22 → 1214.22] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1214.22 → 1215.22] Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1215.22 → 1217.22] Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1217.22 → 1221.22] You are my only hope.
[1221.22 → 1226.22] You're my only prayer.
[1226.22 → 1233.22] So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[1233.22 → 1238.22] Come and give me life.
[1238.22 → 1245.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1245.22 → 1250.22] Where does my help come from?
[1250.22 → 1260.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1260.22 → 1263.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1263.22 → 1264.22] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1264.22 → 1267.22] So please bow your head and pray with me.
[1267.22 → 1276.22] Dear Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with a contrite heart and with praise
[1276.22 → 1284.22] for your glory, with thanksgiving for all you have made and done for us and with our petitions.
[1284.22 → 1292.22] Lord, as we come before you, you know our hearts and our minds, they lie open before you.
[1292.22 → 1297.22] Give us words of honesty that we may pray in truth.
[1297.22 → 1299.22] You have heard our confession, Lord.
[1299.22 → 1306.22] Help us always to remember who we are and give us new hearts so that we may follow you fully
[1306.22 → 1315.22] and so that the work of this congregation in the community may exhibit your love and your glory.
[1315.22 → 1319.22] We thank you, Lord, for the abundant blessings you've bestowed on us,
[1319.22 → 1324.22] for the place you've given us to live, for the beauty of your creation,
[1324.22 → 1331.22] for peace and stability in our land, for new crops in the fields doing well,
[1331.22 → 1344.22] for your protection even during this time of COVID, and above all, for your love in adopting us as your children.
[1344.22 → 1347.22] We pray for our congregation, Lord.
[1347.22 → 1354.22] Be with our Pastor Jason here and Pastor Nancy and their loved ones as they labour amongst us.
[1354.22 → 1360.22] Grant them wisdom and grace and love so that they may do their work.
[1360.22 → 1365.22] March over the elders and deacons in their various tasks and bless their work.
[1365.22 → 1373.22] And you know there are many others who regularly involved in various committees as individuals.
[1373.22 → 1378.22] Grant them all your grace and wisdom.
[1378.22 → 1382.22] Father, we pray for the sick amongst us.
[1382.22 → 1388.22] For John Van Would and John Ram and Joan and Julie.
[1388.22 → 1393.22] For Pat and Andre and Shirley and Diane.
[1393.22 → 1395.22] Grant them healing.
[1395.22 → 1400.22] But above all, grant them your loving presence in their trials.
[1400.22 → 1403.22] We pray for the shut-ins.
[1403.22 → 1411.22] For Cor and Hank and Carl and Honda and Jeanette and Get and Henry.
[1411.22 → 1417.22] Let our caretakers, Lord, understand them and act with love towards them.
[1417.22 → 1427.22] And as the COVID restrictions are slowly being lifted, help their family members and friends to reestablish their relationship with them.
[1427.22 → 1437.22] Lord, there are many isolated brothers and sisters amongst us living alone because of COVID restrictions.
[1437.22 → 1439.22] Singles and widow's and widowers.
[1439.22 → 1445.22] Be near them all and guide us all to keep in touch with a person or phone.
[1445.22 → 1452.22] Lord, we ask that you comfort those amongst us who have recently lost loved ones.
[1452.22 → 1458.22] Be with George, Noreen and Steen and Jake and Mary Anne.
[1458.22 → 1463.22] We pray for our country, Canada.
[1463.22 → 1467.22] Grant the wisdom to those that you have appointed to govern us.
[1467.22 → 1473.22] So be with our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau and the Leader of the Opposition, Aaron O'Toole.
[1473.22 → 1475.22] And with the other party leaders.
[1475.22 → 1480.22] Watch over our Premier, Hogan, and over Mayor Harvey.
[1480.22 → 1483.22] And be with all involved with public safety.
[1483.22 → 1486.22] They work and rule at your command.
[1486.22 → 1490.22] So grant them all the wisdom they need to do what is right.
[1490.22 → 1502.22] Lord, we have heard this last week of the brutal murder of a family of Muslims out of sheer hatred.
[1502.22 → 1508.22] Other visible minorities in our country also face such hatred at times.
[1508.22 → 1513.22] And many of us are ourselves immigrants, the children of immigrants.
[1513.22 → 1517.22] Grant peace and tolerance, we pray.
[1517.22 → 1522.22] And lead us in showing how to treat others with dignity and love.
[1522.22 → 1526.22] For that is how your kingdom grows.
[1526.22 → 1532.22] Lord, have mercy on our world.
[1532.22 → 1537.22] You know of wars in several places, of violence, hatred between people.
[1537.22 → 1540.22] You know of hunger and disease.
[1540.22 → 1547.22] And many millions of refugees driven from their homes and living in camps with little hope.
[1547.22 → 1551.22] Be with those who aim to bring relief.
[1551.22 → 1555.22] Amongst them our own World Renew organization.
[1555.22 → 1560.22] Father, be with your church around the world.
[1560.22 → 1563.22] Heal all its brokenness.
[1563.22 → 1566.22] Be with the missionaries everywhere.
[1566.22 → 1569.22] And help us too to reach out in love.
[1569.22 → 1575.22] And to live such good lives that many may turn to you and find life.
[1575.22 → 1580.22] Lord Jesus, we long for your return.
[1580.22 → 1583.22] When you will set all things right.
[1583.22 → 1587.22] And rule with love and justice and mercy.
[1587.22 → 1588.22] Yes.
[1588.22 → 1590.22] Come Lord Jesus.
[1590.22 → 1591.22] Amen.
[1591.22 → 1609.22] Good morning everyone.
[1609.22 → 1610.22] Good morning.
[1610.22 → 1611.22] Good morning.
[1611.22 → 1618.22] I was just in the fireside room with where Pastor Nancy is leading the Chinese worship service.
[1618.22 → 1622.22] And so I help them lead communion.
[1622.22 → 1625.22] And so it's great to see them also worshipping our Lord.
[1625.22 → 1627.22] And being here together with you.
[1627.22 → 1628.22] And worshipping the Lord together.
[1628.22 → 1631.22] And it's amazing what God is doing amongst us.
[1633.22 → 1641.22] And so, last week we started a new sermon series that we are calling Songs for the Journey.
[1641.22 → 1647.22] And what we saw is that with this little collection of Psalms called the Songs of Ascent.
[1647.22 → 1650.22] Which is Psalm 120 through 134.
[1650.22 → 1655.22] That God is reminding all of us that we are pilgrim people.
[1655.22 → 1657.22] Okay, we are pilgrim people.
[1657.22 → 1664.22] The life of faith, of following Jesus, is not a stationary life.
[1664.22 → 1665.22] Right?
[1665.22 → 1668.22] It's not a life of spiritual stagnation.
[1668.22 → 1671.22] But rather, it's a life of pursuit.
[1671.22 → 1673.22] It's a life of movement.
[1673.22 → 1675.22] And it's a life of pilgrimage.
[1675.22 → 1681.22] On a journey upward and forward and inward to God.
[1681.22 → 1686.22] Paul uses this language in Philippians chapter 3.
[1686.22 → 1687.22] He says,
[1687.22 → 1699.22] Straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
[1699.22 → 1705.22] And so, these Psalms are kind of like our playlist for the journey.
[1705.22 → 1708.22] Maybe now you, I don't know how many of you have Spotify.
[1708.22 → 1710.22] And you can make different playlists.
[1710.22 → 1712.22] And you can maybe go on a trip and listen to those.
[1712.22 → 1716.22] Or when I was in high school, we would make mixtapes.
[1716.22 → 1723.22] Where you can kind of, you know, record the radio, record a song, and then string a bunch of songs together, and you can play your mixtape.
[1723.22 → 1728.22] Well, the people of Israel had the Songs of Ascent.
[1728.22 → 1731.22] That was their mixtape for the road.
[1731.22 → 1741.22] These are the songs, you know, as we talked about last week, that God's people would sing on their way, on the journey, on their pilgrimage, to Jerusalem on their annual pilgrimages.
[1741.22 → 1751.22] And they teach us how to navigate the ups and downs, the twists and turns, how not to lose hope, how to keep going, and to endure.
[1751.22 → 1753.22] So, these are songs for the journey.
[1753.22 → 1756.22] So, last week we began our journey in Psalm 120.
[1756.22 → 1761.22] And we saw that the journey always begins with dissatisfaction.
[1761.22 → 1768.22] Where we look around, and we see the brokenness of this world, and we cry out in dissatisfaction.
[1768.22 → 1777.22] That is how we are able to then decide, well, I'm going to pack my bags, and I'm going to follow Jesus on this road towards peace and flourishing.
[1777.22 → 1782.22] And then now today, Psalm 121, we're on the road.
[1782.22 → 1788.22] The journey has begun, we're heading out, and we're singing what we're going to call today the Guardian Song.
[1788.22 → 1796.22] And what we learned from Psalm 121 is that as soon as we hit the road, we hit trouble.
[1796.22 → 1799.22] As soon as we hit the road, we hit trouble.
[1799.22 → 1802.22] So, let's read Psalm 121 together.
[1802.22 → 1803.22] Let's look at it together.
[1803.22 → 1805.22] I'll read it for us.
[1805.22 → 1809.22] And let us all give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[1809.22 → 1811.22] A song of ascents.
[1811.22 → 1813.22] I lift my eyes to the mountains.
[1813.22 → 1816.22] Where does my help come from?
[1816.22 → 1820.22] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[1820.22 → 1822.22] He will not let your foot slip.
[1822.22 → 1825.22] He who watches over you will not slumber.
[1825.22 → 1830.22] Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[1830.22 → 1833.22] The Lord watches over you.
[1833.22 → 1836.22] The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[1836.22 → 1839.22] The sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night.
[1839.22 → 1842.22] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[1842.22 → 1844.22] He will watch over your life.
[1844.22 → 1850.22] The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
[1850.22 → 1853.22] Let's pray together.
[1853.22 → 1864.22] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for your watchful care on each one of us, each one of our own journeys.
[1864.22 → 1870.22] And Lord, we, in this broken world, we, there's nowhere else that we can turn.
[1870.22 → 1875.22] So we turn to you, Lord, because we know you ultimately are the one who watches and guards us.
[1875.22 → 1877.22] The one who keeps us.
[1877.22 → 1885.22] So, Lord, even each one of us, as we are here this morning, our hearts are often pulled in different directions, seeking different things to help.
[1885.22 → 1892.22] But Lord, would you speak to us this morning and help us to know the truth of who you are.
[1892.22 → 1895.22] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1895.22 → 1903.22] This was the first sermon I've ever given in a church was from Psalm 121.
[1903.22 → 1905.22] I was just thinking about that.
[1905.22 → 1907.22] I had actually that week.
[1907.22 → 1915.22] We were in Taiwan, and I was down in the south doing a mission trip working with high school kids in this camp in the mountains.
[1915.22 → 1918.22] And I was supposed to preach that Sunday, but it was a whole week camp.
[1918.22 → 1920.22] And it was busy night to day.
[1920.22 → 1921.22] I didn't have any time to prepare.
[1921.22 → 1923.22] So I was very stressed out about this.
[1923.22 → 1925.22] I was praying a lot about it.
[1925.22 → 1929.22] You know, I printed off some commentaries and when no one was looking, I would sit down.
[1929.22 → 1931.22] I would be reading and highlighting.
[1931.22 → 1938.22] Then on the train ride back to Tai Bay in the north, I was kind of writing out my sermon on the train.
[1938.22 → 1941.22] Then that Sunday, I was able to preach it.
[1941.22 → 1953.22] And it was just a reminder to me, you know, looking back, this was many years ago, and then here today, again, Psalm 121, about how God watches us on the journey.
[1953.22 → 1964.22] And it was a reminder to me of God's faithfulness in my own life, how God has watched over me, and he's helped me through all the different up and downs that I have walked.
[1964.22 → 1968.22] But here's the big idea of Psalm 121.
[1968.22 → 1974.22] This Psalm tells us that the road we are on is filled with trouble.
[1974.22 → 1980.22] The road we are on is filled with trouble, but we have a guardian who is greater.
[1980.22 → 1992.22] So here's what I want to look at from Psalm 121.
[1992.22 → 1995.22] We're going to start with talking about the trouble that we face.
[1995.22 → 2001.22] And then secondly, we're going to look at the temptations that are all around us.
[2001.22 → 2005.22] And then finally, we're going to see who we can trust on the road.
[2005.22 → 2008.22] Okay, so trouble, temptation and trust.
[2008.22 → 2010.22] Let's look at this together.
[2010.22 → 2014.22] The first point, this Psalm talks about the trouble on the road.
[2014.22 → 2017.22] There it is.
[2017.22 → 2023.22] So let me read for you from Eugene Peterson's book, Along Obedience in the Same Direction.
[2023.22 → 2026.22] I reminded you last week I will often be quoting from this book.
[2026.22 → 2028.22] I recommend you read it.
[2028.22 → 2034.22] Maybe as we're studying the Psalms of Ascent this summer, pick up a copy, Along Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson.
[2034.22 → 2035.22] Read it.
[2035.22 → 2039.22] You'll notice what I'm doing and following, but it's also extremely helpful.
[2039.22 → 2041.22] But here's what he says.
[2041.22 → 2044.22] And listen and see if this resonates with you.
[2044.22 → 2046.22] Quote,
[2046.22 → 2055.22] The moment we say no to the world and yes to God, all our problems are solved.
[2055.22 → 2060.22] All our questions answered, all our troubles over.
[2060.22 → 2065.22] Nothing can disturb the tranquility of a soul at peace with God.
[2065.22 → 2071.22] Nothing can interfere with the blessed assurance that all is well between me and my Saviour.
[2071.22 → 2080.22] We Christians are among that privileged company of persons who don't have accidents, who don't have arguments with our spouses,
[2080.22 → 2087.22] who aren't misunderstood by our peers, whose children do not disobey us.
[2087.22 → 2090.22] So what do you think?
[2090.22 → 2093.22] Does that accurately describe the Christian life?
[2093.22 → 2094.22] Right?
[2094.22 → 2095.22] Has that been your experience?
[2095.22 → 2097.22] Peterson goes on and says this,
[2097.22 → 2100.22] Is this what you believe?
[2100.22 → 2104.22] If it is, I have some incredibly good news for you.
[2104.22 → 2105.22] You are wrong.
[2105.22 → 2109.22] It's great.
[2109.22 → 2113.22] It's good to be told we're wrong when we're wrong.
[2113.22 → 2118.22] It's good to be set straight and on the right path.
[2118.22 → 2122.22] Because this myth of a trouble-free Christian life is indeed that.
[2122.22 → 2123.22] It's a myth.
[2123.22 → 2124.22] It's wrong.
[2124.22 → 2125.22] It's a lie.
[2125.22 → 2126.22] It's a dangerous lie.
[2126.22 → 2131.22] But Psalm 121 comes to the rescue because it tells us the truth.
[2131.22 → 2134.22] It tells us that there is trouble on the road.
[2134.22 → 2140.22] As soon as we begin this walk of discipleship, we find that the road is full of trouble.
[2140.22 → 2141.22] That it is hard.
[2141.22 → 2143.22] That it is treacherous.
[2143.22 → 2145.22] It is full of threats.
[2145.22 → 2151.22] So Psalm 121 unpacks what some of these troubles are using this very poetic and symbolic language.
[2151.22 → 2155.22] There are multiple kinds of dangers on the road that are mentioned here.
[2155.22 → 2157.22] So look with me at the psalm for a moment.
[2157.22 → 2162.22] In verse 3, the psalmist talks about the dangers of our feet slipping.
[2162.22 → 2171.22] And if your feet slip, you know, if you've ever been hiking or on a trail, and your foot is slipping, it means that the way is treacherous.
[2171.22 → 2173.22] It's not a smooth, easy way.
[2173.22 → 2175.22] It can cause us to fall.
[2175.22 → 2180.22] And this is an allusion to things that can trip us up on the road.
[2180.22 → 2185.22] For us today, that can be the real dangers that we meet in life.
[2185.22 → 2190.22] It can also be our own wayward hearts that lead us into sin.
[2190.22 → 2197.22] And the thing with sin is it often has real-world consequences that cause us to stumble in life.
[2197.22 → 2201.22] Verse 6, we see the danger of the sun.
[2201.22 → 2209.22] So travelling in the Middle East through the mountain regions, if you can use your imagination, there were not a lot of trees.
[2209.22 → 2220.22] So they would experience long exposure to the heat of the sun, where there was potential for sunburn, for dehydration, for heat stroke.
[2220.22 → 2223.22] And they would be travelling with their children, with their elderly.
[2223.22 → 2230.22] The sun represents everything that happens in life under the sun.
[2230.22 → 2235.22] Right? And because of sin, life under the sun is tragically broken.
[2235.22 → 2241.22] And it's moving, it seems, all the time toward disorder and injustice and death.
[2241.22 → 2244.22] And it seems that the world is just falling apart under us.
[2244.22 → 2253.22] And as we walk on this journey of life, sometimes we feel this long exposure to this blazing, scorching heat of the sun.
[2253.22 → 2263.22] We experience that in our personal lives, maybe in our work, in our families, in our relationships, even maybe in our church.
[2263.22 → 2266.22] Sometimes even in our common public life.
[2266.22 → 2269.22] Right? Seems like nothing is the way it's supposed to be.
[2269.22 → 2274.22] But also in verse 6, there's the danger of the moon.
[2274.22 → 2281.22] So one of my children's favourite books growing up was called Goodnight Moon.
[2281.22 → 2283.22] Has anybody ever read that?
[2283.22 → 2285.22] Okay. Some of you may have.
[2285.22 → 2287.22] So there's a line in Goodnight Moon.
[2287.22 → 2290.22] I could probably quote the entire book to you with a couple prompts.
[2290.22 → 2292.22] But we've read it so many times.
[2292.22 → 2294.22] But it says this,
[2294.22 → 2298.22] I see the moon and the moon sees me.
[2298.22 → 2302.22] God bless the moon and God bless me.
[2302.22 → 2305.22] Right? It sounds so lovely, doesn't it?
[2305.22 → 2310.22] But the moon to ancient people was not a romantic, lovely thing.
[2310.22 → 2316.22] People didn't go out in the night to take walks under the light of the moon.
[2316.22 → 2320.22] The moon was actually seen as a perilous and evil thing.
[2320.22 → 2328.22] We get a sense of this because of our word lunatic or lunacy comes from the Latin word,
[2328.22 → 2331.22] Luna, which means moon.
[2331.22 → 2332.22] Right?
[2332.22 → 2339.22] They had this idea that there would be this emotional disturbance because of the ill effect of the moon.
[2339.22 → 2345.22] The Bible says that there is a personal force of evil that is seeking to undo us.
[2345.22 → 2348.22] And to destroy us.
[2348.22 → 2354.22] But there's also the dangers of the dark in general because as they were going up this hill,
[2354.22 → 2360.22] there would be wild beasts in the wilderness that like to eat other creatures, including humans.
[2360.22 → 2367.22] There would be bandits in the hills that would be hiding out and seeking pilgrims who would come by,
[2367.22 → 2373.22] who they would then attack and take your stuff, leave you for dead.
[2373.22 → 2377.22] Just like the man who was left for dead in the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[2377.22 → 2379.22] This was a real possibility.
[2379.22 → 2381.22] And so there you go.
[2381.22 → 2382.22] That's our reality.
[2382.22 → 2388.22] Slipping feet, the scorching sun, the evils of the moon and all that lurks in the night.
[2388.22 → 2392.22] Martin Luther often said we have three terrible enemies in this life.
[2392.22 → 2395.22] The world, the flesh and the devil.
[2395.22 → 2398.22] And all three are conspiring to destroy us.
[2398.22 → 2401.22] There's the heat of the sun and all that happens in this world.
[2401.22 → 2404.22] There's the stumbling of our own sinful flesh.
[2404.22 → 2407.22] And there's the evil conspiring of the devil himself.
[2407.22 → 2409.22] And that is our journey.
[2409.22 → 2411.22] It is full of trouble.
[2411.22 → 2412.22] Right?
[2412.22 → 2414.22] You never know what's going to come around the bend.
[2414.22 → 2420.22] You never know what accident you might suddenly fall into, what danger might happen.
[2420.22 → 2421.22] Life is uncertain.
[2421.22 → 2423.22] It is unstable.
[2423.22 → 2424.22] Nothing is guaranteed.
[2424.22 → 2428.22] And as you think about your life, I'm sure every one of us here this morning
[2428.22 → 2434.22] and all those who are watching with us, you could bring to mind a problem in your life right now
[2434.22 → 2438.22] without too much trouble.
[2438.22 → 2443.22] And what happens is when we face difficulties and troubles on the road, you know, when things go bad,
[2443.22 → 2448.22] when something goes wrong in our lives, what do we do?
[2448.22 → 2454.22] Sometimes as Christians, and I've done this, is we think, well, God must be mad at me.
[2454.22 → 2458.22] Or we think, well, God must be punishing me.
[2458.22 → 2461.22] Or it must be because he's actually not there at all.
[2461.22 → 2462.22] Right?
[2462.22 → 2466.22] We think God is supposed to give us what we want to make our life go well and easy.
[2466.22 → 2470.22] And when he doesn't, our faith gets thrown into question.
[2470.22 → 2476.22] And this psalm is given to us because God loves us.
[2476.22 → 2480.22] And he wants to comfort us and say, no, God is not mad at you.
[2480.22 → 2482.22] God has not turned his back on you.
[2482.22 → 2483.22] God has not abandoned you.
[2483.22 → 2485.22] And you are not lost.
[2485.22 → 2486.22] God has not lost it at all.
[2486.22 → 2492.22] This is what a faithful pilgrim, one who is following God, on this journey toward God
[2492.22 → 2497.22] and worshipping him, this is what you can expect on the road.
[2497.22 → 2504.22] And that's why Christians throughout the centuries have turned to the psalms.
[2504.22 → 2511.04] We have loved the Psalms because the Psalms are so realistic about the harsh realities of life.
[2512.38 → 2519.72] And the Psalms give us this language not only to comfort us, but to use and to cry out with to God.
[2521.58 → 2524.74] So the life of faith does not exempt us from trouble and pain.
[2525.08 → 2530.30] The real trouble with trouble, the problem is what do you do with it?
[2530.30 → 2536.92] Not that you will have trouble, but when you do face trouble, what will you do with it?
[2537.46 → 2538.32] That's the real trouble.
[2538.74 → 2540.78] And that leads us to our second point this morning.
[2541.10 → 2544.52] Because there's not just trouble on the road, there's also temptation on the road.
[2545.44 → 2547.18] When we're in trouble, what do we do?
[2548.28 → 2554.42] If you've seen kids anytime, and they can't do something, or they have need having trouble, what do they say?
[2554.98 → 2556.94] Help, right? I need help.
[2557.98 → 2559.40] And that's what we see here in verse 1.
[2559.40 → 2561.04] The psalmist says,
[2561.50 → 2569.66] So imagine this with me.
[2570.60 → 2580.00] On a journey to Jerusalem, the pilgrim would have to travel through hilly, mountainous regions of Palestine.
[2580.36 → 2586.96] And these hills were often the places where the Canaanites had established their places of worship.
[2586.96 → 2592.48] These are all the high places that are mentioned throughout the Old Testament.
[2592.60 → 2594.74] They're mentioned like 78 times, I read.
[2596.12 → 2599.44] And there, up in the mountains, the Canaanites had built their shrines.
[2599.50 → 2600.46] They had built their temples.
[2600.46 → 2600.90] They had built their temples.
[2600.90 → 2603.74] Where they would go and worship their gods.
[2604.32 → 2607.22] They would engage in sacrifice and cult prostitution.
[2607.88 → 2612.38] And anyone at any time could go up in those mountains, go up to the tops of the mountains.
[2612.52 → 2614.08] They would engage in acts of worship.
[2614.08 → 2617.12] That promised help.
[2617.12 → 2620.20] That promised to protect you from evil.
[2621.30 → 2623.50] And throughout the Old Testament, what do we see?
[2623.84 → 2630.60] God's people were constantly tempted and snared by these high places.
[2630.60 → 2637.44] They would lead God's people astray from worshipping and trusting in Yahweh, the God of Israel.
[2638.26 → 2647.22] And so you can imagine now a pilgrim walking through these hills in the temptations they might face along the way.
[2647.56 → 2648.74] They're travelling along.
[2649.12 → 2654.08] They have all the dangers about them on the trail, the dangers of the sun and the moon.
[2654.20 → 2654.90] They're afraid.
[2654.90 → 2659.64] They're passing by these places of worship, which are offering help.
[2660.74 → 2660.94] Right?
[2661.02 → 2662.54] Do you want protection from the sun?
[2663.04 → 2664.40] Well, go to the sun priest.
[2665.24 → 2668.34] Are you afraid of the evil power of the moonlight?
[2668.58 → 2673.46] Well, go to the priestess of the moon who can give you an omelet to wear around your neck.
[2674.26 → 2679.78] Are you worried about some evil force tripping you and stumbling and falling?
[2679.78 → 2685.12] Well, you can go to the shrine to learn the magic formula that promises to keep you safe.
[2686.18 → 2690.54] So you see that when the psalmist asks, where does my help come from?
[2690.76 → 2693.42] He's saying, should I look to the hills?
[2694.62 → 2694.74] Right?
[2694.80 → 2697.92] Is that where I should seek my help?
[2698.86 → 2702.20] It seems so readily available.
[2702.80 → 2704.20] It seems so easy.
[2704.74 → 2707.40] They seem so friendly and able to help.
[2707.40 → 2709.10] There's so many other people doing it.
[2709.78 → 2710.80] Maybe it works.
[2712.96 → 2714.92] And so friends, here's my question for you.
[2715.98 → 2718.24] What do you turn to when you are in trouble?
[2719.60 → 2719.74] Right?
[2719.80 → 2724.28] Who do you turn to when you need help?
[2725.00 → 2725.26] Right?
[2725.28 → 2729.40] The truth is that all of us have gods in the hills that we turn to.
[2730.42 → 2730.84] Right?
[2730.86 → 2734.08] Of course, as modern people, we're not tempted by the Canaanite deities.
[2734.76 → 2737.74] But we have plenty of gods that we turn to for help.
[2737.74 → 2741.12] So I want to mention three in particular that come to mind.
[2741.42 → 2746.40] That basically, in every time, in every age, including our own, are temptations to us.
[2747.06 → 2747.84] So three of them.
[2747.88 → 2750.24] The first one is the temptation to magic.
[2750.24 → 2752.24] What?
[2754.24 → 2754.60] Yes.
[2755.36 → 2757.12] Now, I know you're going to say, I don't believe in magic.
[2757.38 → 2757.98] Well, I know.
[2758.58 → 2759.40] But what is magic?
[2760.26 → 2767.78] Magic is simply the belief that if you have the right knowledge, if you have the right technique, then it will solve your problems.
[2767.78 → 2773.64] And often, that knowledge and that technique is hidden.
[2774.20 → 2778.00] It's only available to those who become enlightened.
[2778.16 → 2779.50] It's hidden from the unenlightened.
[2779.88 → 2786.74] But it's a way of gaining certain techniques and practices that can help you get an upper hand in life.
[2786.74 → 2789.96] In our modern world, we don't call it magic anymore.
[2790.42 → 2801.50] But isn't that what all of our self-help books, all of our desperate dependence on technology is all about?
[2802.86 → 2803.06] Right?
[2803.08 → 2810.90] It's all about finding the right techniques, the right rituals, the right insights that we can turn to gain control over our lives.
[2810.90 → 2814.84] That's what people throughout history have called magic.
[2816.22 → 2819.14] The difference between magic and technology is not that different.
[2819.88 → 2821.64] We often turn to that for help.
[2822.76 → 2827.38] The second temptation, maybe even more dangerous, is called moralism.
[2827.88 → 2837.46] Moralism is the belief that if you live right, if you do the right things, if you are good people, even for Christians, if you go to church regularly, read your Bible every day, and tithe,
[2837.46 → 2848.18] then God, or whatever you believe in, the universe, or karma, or whatever you think it is, it will watch out for you in a sense.
[2848.48 → 2855.22] It will, if you do what is right, then the universe owes you a relatively easy and comfortable life.
[2856.38 → 2857.28] So that's moralism.
[2858.34 → 2864.72] The third temptation is mammon, or what we call today money, which is also like technology.
[2864.72 → 2870.48] Money promises protection and control over our life that we want to have.
[2871.30 → 2871.40] Right?
[2871.48 → 2876.46] Money is what we trust in to give us security and comfort when we face trouble.
[2876.80 → 2878.76] I'm in trouble, but I have some money.
[2879.10 → 2879.50] I'm okay.
[2880.68 → 2887.82] So, magic, moralism, and mammon are temptations that are common to all of us, even today.
[2887.82 → 2893.84] But these things that we look to for help ultimately can't protect you.
[2894.78 → 2894.98] Right?
[2895.04 → 2899.92] Because what they ultimately are fundamentally is they are about trusting in yourself.
[2900.90 → 2906.12] And the truth about us is that we are not smart and clever enough.
[2906.32 → 2908.30] We are not good enough.
[2908.56 → 2912.62] We are not wealthy or rich enough to solve all the problems of life.
[2912.62 → 2919.40] There are some things that our intelligence and our goodness and our wealth cannot protect us from.
[2920.84 → 2923.94] A look to the hills for help ends in disappointment and disaster.
[2924.32 → 2926.80] The prophet Jeremiah says in chapter 2,
[2927.16 → 2929.24] Truly the hills are a delusion.
[2930.94 → 2932.20] Don't look to the hills.
[2933.66 → 2936.22] So then, that's off the table.
[2936.96 → 2938.16] Who do we look to for help?
[2938.94 → 2939.08] Right?
[2939.12 → 2940.28] Who do we trust on the road?
[2940.28 → 2942.32] And that brings us to our third point.
[2943.96 → 2945.46] Psalm 121 tells us this.
[2945.98 → 2947.34] I lift my eyes to the mountains.
[2947.56 → 2948.76] Where does my help come from?
[2949.40 → 2955.20] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[2956.14 → 2956.34] Right?
[2956.44 → 2958.42] So, the psalmist, he considers the mountains.
[2958.82 → 2960.80] But he says, no, I'm not going to look to the mountains.
[2961.34 → 2964.22] I will look to the one who made the mountains.
[2964.60 → 2968.62] I'm not going to look to creation or anything in creation.
[2968.62 → 2972.12] I'm going to look to the creator of all things.
[2972.46 → 2977.56] I'm going to look to the Lord, the covenant God of Israel,
[2977.90 → 2981.66] who has been faithful to his people for centuries.
[2981.98 → 2983.80] The God of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2983.96 → 2985.18] He alone is our protector.
[2985.74 → 2986.70] He alone is our help.
[2986.70 → 2993.20] So, the Hebrew word that this pilgrim uses about God over and over in this psalm is the word shaman.
[2993.82 → 2997.30] He uses it six times in eight verses.
[2997.58 → 2999.60] Now, our translations will change it.
[2999.80 → 3001.02] They'll give us a different translation.
[3001.22 → 3002.26] They'll say God is your keeper.
[3002.76 → 3004.58] Or they'll say God is the one who watches over you.
[3004.70 → 3006.16] Or they'll say God is your guardian.
[3006.28 → 3007.40] It's all the same Hebrew word.
[3007.68 → 3008.56] Shamar, shaman, shaman.
[3009.68 → 3010.56] That's who it is.
[3010.56 → 3015.30] He is the keeper, the guardian over all trouble.
[3015.90 → 3020.84] Night and day, known and unknown, all trouble that threatens to destroy us.
[3022.36 → 3028.14] So, Alexander the Great is said to have been able to sleep like a rock.
[3029.10 → 3030.18] Sleep like a rock.
[3030.82 → 3032.88] Apparently, he was a champion sleeper.
[3033.52 → 3036.02] He could sleep anywhere under any condition at all.
[3036.02 → 3044.60] And this made people wonder, like, how on earth does a man in his position who faces all the enemies that he has to face with all the wars,
[3045.06 → 3049.44] all the strategies in his mind that he has to wrestle with, all the stresses, all the battles,
[3049.64 → 3054.70] how on earth can Alexander the Great sleep so well?
[3055.68 → 3057.24] So, he was once asked that question.
[3058.08 → 3060.64] And he answered, well, it's because of Armenia.
[3061.62 → 3063.84] So, Armenia was his guard.
[3063.84 → 3074.76] He was his faithful, strong, strongest, mightiest guard in his army, his personal bodyguard, who you did not mess with.
[3076.14 → 3079.02] Armenia would watch over Alexander as he slept.
[3079.12 → 3080.46] He would stand by him.
[3081.84 → 3085.12] He did not slumber or sleep when Alexander the Great did.
[3086.02 → 3088.62] And that's how Alexander could sleep so well.
[3088.62 → 3092.10] So, then James Boyce in his commentary says,
[3092.20 → 3101.02] Friends, how much more than can we rest and sleep secure knowing that the one who watches over us is the one who made the heavens and the earth,
[3101.48 → 3104.04] who will neither slumber nor sleep?
[3104.18 → 3105.04] He is your guardian.
[3107.18 → 3110.56] This psalm tells us that God will never abandon you, that he is faithful.
[3110.94 → 3112.30] He always knows where you are.
[3112.56 → 3114.64] He is always with you wherever you go.
[3114.64 → 3117.74] He is never distracted, and he never turns away from you.
[3118.60 → 3125.54] Even as a parent, a parent may sometimes fall asleep when they're supposed to be watching a child.
[3125.76 → 3127.10] Just, I don't know, theoretically.
[3127.56 → 3128.50] This might happen.
[3130.02 → 3132.30] But the Lord is never weary.
[3133.06 → 3134.22] He never gets distracted.
[3134.42 → 3135.96] He's never inattentive.
[3136.52 → 3141.42] He never loses sight of the exact conditions of his people.
[3141.42 → 3144.60] His gaze is fixed on you, and he loves you.
[3146.60 → 3147.04] Okay.
[3147.38 → 3148.90] So, let's ask the hard question.
[3150.66 → 3154.84] Does this psalm promise more than it can deliver?
[3156.60 → 3158.82] Is this psalm true?
[3159.98 → 3160.16] Right?
[3160.96 → 3164.42] You might say, well, I know plenty of Christians who have stumbled,
[3164.42 → 3168.28] who have been harmed, who have suffered,
[3168.84 → 3171.82] who have gotten cancer, who've had accidents.
[3173.10 → 3175.58] That probably describes all of us today.
[3177.24 → 3179.96] So, if this psalm is saying, with God as our guardian,
[3180.32 → 3182.42] no harm or difficulty can befall us,
[3182.94 → 3184.96] well, that doesn't match up with our experience.
[3184.96 → 3189.92] And so, God doesn't do what this psalm claims to do.
[3191.50 → 3197.30] But remember, we are never promised immunity from pain and trouble.
[3198.06 → 3198.16] Right?
[3198.24 → 3200.80] That is not the promise of this psalm.
[3202.02 → 3204.04] Eugene Peterson says this,
[3204.04 → 3224.52] That's the promise of this psalm.
[3225.16 → 3225.54] Right?
[3225.62 → 3226.74] Not that we won't stumble.
[3227.28 → 3230.20] Not that we won't face the brokenness of this world day and night.
[3230.20 → 3236.16] The promise of the psalm is that God is constantly faithful to us.
[3236.84 → 3238.22] It means that when we stumble,
[3238.84 → 3241.12] and when, as the hymn writer wrote,
[3241.26 → 3244.00] when sorrows like sea billows roll,
[3245.12 → 3247.72] no matter what we might lose along the way,
[3247.84 → 3250.10] God is faithful, and he will guard you from everything
[3250.10 → 3253.58] that can ultimately and truly destroy you.
[3253.74 → 3258.30] From everything that can separate you from his love.
[3258.30 → 3263.32] He is your guardian and your travel companion
[3263.32 → 3265.20] on this pilgrimage of the Christian life.
[3266.80 → 3268.00] How do we know that?
[3268.60 → 3270.00] We know that because of Jesus.
[3270.88 → 3271.02] Right?
[3271.16 → 3276.54] In Jesus, God is not some distant deity looking down on us
[3276.54 → 3278.44] and maybe kind of checking in once in a while
[3278.44 → 3280.88] and missing a great deal of what happens in our lives.
[3281.50 → 3284.62] But, in fact, God came to us in Jesus.
[3284.98 → 3286.50] In Jesus, God entered our life.
[3286.50 → 3288.38] He joined our pilgrimage.
[3289.82 → 3292.52] Jesus has experienced all the brokenness
[3292.52 → 3294.76] and all the hardship of life.
[3295.42 → 3295.54] Right?
[3295.62 → 3299.12] He has experienced pain and mockery,
[3300.04 → 3303.28] rejection, betrayal, injustice,
[3304.38 → 3306.04] emotional and physical suffering.
[3306.40 → 3309.94] And ultimately, he surrendered his life to death.
[3309.94 → 3312.90] And in that one singular case,
[3312.90 → 3315.98] the guardian, the Lord of the heavens and the earth,
[3316.52 → 3317.66] the keeper of Israel,
[3318.02 → 3320.82] in that case, the guardian abandoned Jesus.
[3322.08 → 3324.76] He abandoned Jesus to evil,
[3325.26 → 3326.56] to hell,
[3327.20 → 3328.22] and to judgment
[3328.22 → 3331.10] to face death for us.
[3331.10 → 3334.42] But then Jesus rose from the dead
[3334.42 → 3336.96] and now he promises to all who follow him
[3336.96 → 3339.64] on this pilgrimage of the Christian life,
[3339.96 → 3342.30] he promises us new life now
[3342.30 → 3344.96] and eternal life forever.
[3344.96 → 3349.08] And it's not that nothing bad will ever happen to you.
[3349.14 → 3350.70] It's that nothing so bad can happen
[3350.70 → 3352.54] that it will ever separate you
[3352.54 → 3354.36] from the love of God
[3354.36 → 3356.84] that Jesus has secured for you
[3356.84 → 3358.90] through his life, death, and resurrection.
[3358.90 → 3362.66] Paul famously says in Romans 8,
[3363.38 → 3364.46] For I am convinced
[3364.46 → 3367.12] that neither death nor life,
[3367.46 → 3369.02] neither angels nor demons,
[3369.46 → 3370.98] neither the present nor the future,
[3371.10 → 3372.02] nor any powers,
[3372.42 → 3373.56] neither height nor depth,
[3373.62 → 3375.58] nor anything else in all creation
[3375.58 → 3377.50] will be able to separate us
[3377.50 → 3378.66] from the love of God
[3378.66 → 3380.74] that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[3381.78 → 3382.06] Right?
[3382.10 → 3383.92] The promise of the psalm is,
[3384.24 → 3386.00] in fact, the promise of the whole scriptures
[3386.00 → 3389.04] is that we are never,
[3389.32 → 3392.58] not even for any single moment in our lives,
[3392.92 → 3394.88] ever outside the love of God
[3394.88 → 3397.14] and his washable care over us.
[3397.52 → 3397.66] Right?
[3397.74 → 3399.22] He is our guardian.
[3401.96 → 3403.76] So I'm going to close with this story.
[3405.26 → 3407.26] Donald Barn house was a pastor
[3407.26 → 3408.54] of a church in Philadelphia.
[3409.48 → 3412.12] And when his wife was in her 30s,
[3412.26 → 3413.20] she died of cancer.
[3413.20 → 3416.22] And he was on the way home
[3416.22 → 3417.40] from the funeral
[3417.40 → 3418.76] and his little children
[3418.76 → 3420.32] were in the backseat of the car
[3420.32 → 3422.08] and they were all just in shock
[3422.08 → 3422.84] and bewilderment.
[3423.62 → 3424.84] And he was trying to think
[3424.84 → 3426.28] of something to offer them
[3426.28 → 3427.36] to comfort them.
[3428.14 → 3429.16] And at that moment,
[3429.32 → 3430.80] a huge moving van,
[3431.30 → 3432.28] Mantra on the side,
[3432.36 → 3432.66] no, just kidding,
[3433.02 → 3434.10] but a huge moving van
[3434.10 → 3435.40] drove by the car
[3435.40 → 3437.60] and its shadow
[3437.60 → 3439.44] passed over the car.
[3439.44 → 3442.76] And Barn house turned around
[3442.76 → 3443.30] to his children
[3443.30 → 3444.40] as they got to the stoplight
[3444.40 → 3444.74] and said,
[3444.86 → 3445.14] kids,
[3445.36 → 3446.82] would you rather be run over
[3446.82 → 3447.64] by a truck
[3447.64 → 3450.66] or the shadow of a truck?
[3451.44 → 3452.50] Of course, the kids said,
[3452.56 → 3454.00] well, the shadow of a truck, daddy.
[3454.88 → 3456.44] To which Barn house replied,
[3456.72 → 3457.78] 2,000 years ago,
[3457.84 → 3458.88] the truck of death
[3458.88 → 3460.40] ran over Jesus.
[3460.40 → 3463.40] So only the shadow of death
[3463.40 → 3464.98] passed over mommy.
[3465.98 → 3466.62] She is safe.
[3468.18 → 3468.88] And friends,
[3468.94 → 3470.02] that's our reality too.
[3470.92 → 3471.02] Right?
[3471.12 → 3472.20] Jesus endured death.
[3472.56 → 3474.28] He endured the scorching sun.
[3474.98 → 3477.46] Jesus endured the evils of the night.
[3477.66 → 3478.78] He endured all of that.
[3478.86 → 3481.58] So we only have to ever face
[3481.58 → 3482.74] the shadow of death.
[3483.50 → 3485.62] And even in the shadow of death,
[3485.88 → 3487.20] Psalm 23 tells us,
[3487.50 → 3488.54] God is with us.
[3488.54 → 3491.28] So not even death itself
[3491.28 → 3492.22] can separate us
[3492.22 → 3492.96] from the love of God.
[3493.24 → 3494.18] Even in death,
[3494.32 → 3495.00] we are kept.
[3496.24 → 3497.02] Because we believe
[3497.02 → 3497.74] in Jesus Christ,
[3497.88 → 3498.10] therefore,
[3498.26 → 3499.54] we can confidently say,
[3500.10 → 3502.38] the Lord will watch over
[3502.38 → 3503.24] you're coming
[3503.24 → 3504.14] and you're going
[3504.14 → 3504.88] both now
[3504.88 → 3506.36] and forevermore.
[3507.62 → 3508.28] So friends,
[3508.34 → 3509.28] the road we are on
[3509.28 → 3510.42] is filled with trouble,
[3510.78 → 3511.90] but we have a guardian
[3511.90 → 3512.54] who is greater.
[3513.24 → 3513.82] And that
[3513.82 → 3516.36] is what you've been given
[3516.36 → 3517.30] in Jesus.
[3518.54 → 3520.10] Let's pray together.
[3523.28 → 3523.92] Lord,
[3524.00 → 3524.70] thank you that
[3524.70 → 3526.22] you are always with us,
[3526.26 → 3527.72] you always watch over us.
[3529.30 → 3530.12] So often
[3530.12 → 3530.68] we
[3530.68 → 3532.88] doubt that,
[3533.78 → 3534.92] especially, Lord,
[3534.96 → 3536.28] when we face trouble in life,
[3536.28 → 3538.14] we wonder if
[3538.14 → 3540.20] you don't see
[3540.20 → 3541.64] or don't care.
[3541.64 → 3543.70] but, Lord,
[3543.78 → 3544.40] you promise
[3544.40 → 3545.66] your faithfulness to us,
[3545.80 → 3546.28] you promise
[3546.28 → 3547.00] your love to us
[3547.00 → 3547.82] through our Lord Jesus,
[3548.96 → 3549.82] and that you walk
[3549.82 → 3550.74] alongside us
[3550.74 → 3551.42] on this whole
[3551.42 → 3552.48] pilgrim journey.
[3553.74 → 3553.96] And, Lord,
[3554.02 → 3554.52] in the end,
[3554.58 → 3555.82] you will see us
[3555.82 → 3556.18] through
[3556.18 → 3558.12] to God,
[3558.34 → 3559.42] to your eternal kingdom.
[3560.24 → 3561.00] We thank you
[3561.00 → 3562.00] for that great promise
[3562.00 → 3562.76] that is stronger
[3562.76 → 3563.76] and better than anything
[3563.76 → 3564.46] else in this world
[3564.46 → 3564.86] can offer.
[3565.86 → 3567.14] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3567.54 → 3567.80] Amen.
[3567.80 → 3567.90] Amen.
[3567.90 → 3567.94] Amen.
[3567.94 → 3567.96] Amen.
[3567.96 → 3567.98] Amen.
[3567.98 → 3568.00] Amen.
[3568.00 → 3568.04] Amen.
[3571.64 → 3593.38] Jesus said that if I thirst,
[3593.38 → 3597.44] I should come to Him.
[3597.44 → 3602.12] No one else can satisfy,
[3602.70 → 3606.46] I should come to Him.
[3607.28 → 3611.70] Jesus said if I am weak,
[3611.92 → 3615.68] I should come to Him.
[3616.34 → 3620.78] No one else can be my strength,
[3620.78 → 3624.66] I should come to Him.
[3624.66 → 3629.92] For the Lord is good and faithful,
[3630.30 → 3634.20] He will keep us day and night.
[3634.42 → 3639.18] We can always run to Jesus,
[3640.30 → 3643.96] Jesus strong and kind.
[3643.96 → 3644.54] Amen.
[3644.54 → 3646.62] Amen.
[3646.62 → 3656.76] Jesus said that if I fear,
[3656.76 → 3660.76] I should come to Him.
[3660.76 → 3665.76] No one else can be my shield,
[3665.96 → 3669.92] I should come to Him.
[3670.30 → 3675.02] For the Lord is good and faithful,
[3675.02 → 3679.58] He will keep us day and night.
[3679.58 → 3679.60] He will keep us day and night.
[3679.60 → 3684.48] We can always run to Jesus,
[3684.48 → 3689.20] Jesus strong and kind.
[3689.20 → 3701.88] Jesus said if I am lost,
[3701.88 → 3705.34] He will come to me.
[3705.34 → 3711.04] And He showed me on the cross,
[3711.04 → 3715.00] He will come to me.
[3715.00 → 3720.14] For the Lord is good and faithful,
[3720.14 → 3724.88] He will keep us day and night.
[3724.88 → 3730.00] We can always run to Jesus,
[3730.00 → 3734.74] Jesus strong and kind.
[3734.74 → 3739.98] For the Lord is good and faithful,
[3739.98 → 3744.68] He will keep us day and night.
[3744.68 → 3749.82] We can always run to Jesus,
[3749.82 → 3754.68] Jesus strong and kind.
[3754.68 → 3760.68] Jesus strong and kind.
[3760.68 → 3789.06] So we come now to the celebration of the Lord's Supper.
[3789.06 → 3791.40] And to begin,
[3791.40 → 3797.76] I found a communion liturgy that is based on the contemporary testimony,
[3797.76 → 3799.06] our world belongs to God.
[3799.06 → 3802.06] So we will put that on the screen here.
[3802.06 → 3806.06] There it is.
[3806.06 → 3808.36] So where it says all,
[3808.36 → 3809.62] I invite you to say it with me.
[3809.62 → 3810.56] And I can't.
[3810.56 → 3812.06] I'll read it here.
[3812.06 → 3817.06] God meets us in the sacraments,
[3817.06 → 3822.06] communicating grace to us by means of this bread and wine.
[3822.06 → 3825.06] God, you are making all things new.
[3825.06 → 3834.06] Here, Christ offers His own crucified body and shed blood to His people,
[3834.06 → 3837.06] assuring them a share in His death and resurrection.
[3837.06 → 3841.06] God, you are making all things new.
[3841.06 → 3853.06] By the Holy Spirit, He feeds us with His resurrection life and binds us to each other as we share one loaf and one cup.
[3853.06 → 3858.06] God, you are making all things new.
[3858.06 → 3866.06] We receive this food gladly, believing as we eat that Jesus is our life, giving food and drink,
[3866.06 → 3870.06] and that He will come again to call us to the wedding feast of the Lamb.
[3870.06 → 3874.06] God, you are making all things new.
[3874.06 → 3877.06] Our Lord Jesus Christ invites us to this table.
[3877.06 → 3880.06] He invites us to feed on Him.
[3880.06 → 3883.06] Jesus came into this world.
[3883.06 → 3885.06] He experienced all that we go through,
[3885.06 → 3890.06] but was without sin and never fell into temptation.
[3890.06 → 3896.06] And He died on the cross for us on our behalf,
[3896.06 → 3902.06] so that He could bring us into His eternal kingdom through His life and resurrection.
[3902.06 → 3908.06] And so this table is for all those who believe and trust in Christ,
[3908.06 → 3913.06] who call out for help, and when they do so, they turn to the Lord Jesus.
[3913.06 → 3917.06] So this table is for Christians, and if you have put your faith in Christ,
[3917.06 → 3921.06] and if you have been baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[3921.06 → 3924.06] then Jesus bids you come to eat with Him.
[3924.06 → 3930.06] If you are not yet a follower of Christ, we are still so glad that you are here.
[3930.06 → 3935.06] And we ask that you would use this time to consider what the Lord has done for you,
[3935.06 → 3936.06] and how much He loves you.
[3936.06 → 3940.06] But we ask you not to partake and participate at this time.
[3940.06 → 3945.06] So the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, He took bread.
[3945.06 → 3947.06] And when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
[3947.06 → 3951.06] This is my body, which is for you. Do it in remembrance of me.
[3951.06 → 3955.06] The same way also He took the cup after supper, saying,
[3955.06 → 3958.06] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[3958.06 → 3963.06] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[3963.06 → 3966.06] For as often as you eat this bread, and you drink this cup,
[3966.06 → 3972.06] you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again, and He will come again.
[3972.06 → 3976.06] Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[3976.06 → 3982.06] Jesus invites you to feed on Him by faith in your hearts with Thanksgiving,
[3982.06 → 3986.06] knowing that He died for you.
[3988.06 → 3995.06] So we still must use these little cups and use dry cleaning.
[3995.06 → 3999.06] But go ahead and open the top, and you can pull out your wafer.
[4001.06 → 4003.06] So let's prepare to eat together.
[4004.06 → 4007.06] The body of Christ shed for you, or broken for you.
[4007.06 → 4009.06] The body of Christ broken for you. Let's eat together.
[4025.06 → 4041.06] I'll give you a second to get the lid off of your cup.
[4041.06 → 4046.06] Brothers and sisters, the blood of Christ shed for you.
[4046.06 → 4050.06] Take, drink, remember, and believe that Jesus loves you.
[4050.06 → 4062.06] Let's pray.
[4066.06 → 4069.06] Our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4069.06 → 4074.06] Your mercy, Your love, Your faithfulness
[4074.06 → 4078.06] are more than we can even imagine.
[4079.06 → 4080.06] Or believe.
[4081.06 → 4084.06] But Lord, by faith, or by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[4084.06 → 4087.06] You have given this gift of faith to us.
[4087.06 → 4090.06] It does not come from ourselves, it comes from You.
[4091.06 → 4096.06] So Lord, we turn to You because of what the Holy Spirit has done in our lives.
[4097.06 → 4099.06] And we look to You, and we trust in You.
[4099.06 → 4103.06] And we hold on to You and all the ups and downs of this life.
[4103.06 → 4108.06] And Lord, we thank You for the reminder, Lord, that You have accomplished it all.
[4108.06 → 4114.06] As we have already feasted on Your broken body and Your shed blood.
[4115.06 → 4119.06] And Lord, it's a picture of the life that we can now take into ourselves.
[4120.06 → 4122.06] And that is a gift of grace to us.
[4122.06 → 4125.06] So Lord, we take it, we receive it.
[4125.06 → 4130.06] And Lord, we ask that by Your grace, that You would nourish us to walk with You
[4131.06 → 4133.06] on this pilgrim journey.
[4134.06 → 4137.06] That even as we leave from here and go throughout our weeks,
[4137.06 → 4141.06] that You would send us out with Your blessing,
[4141.06 → 4145.06] the name of Jesus on our lips and the trust of Him in our hearts.
[4145.06 → 4151.06] Lord, be gracious to us, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4151.06 → 4152.06] Amen.
[4164.06 → 4167.06] So now we do go out from here with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4167.06 → 4170.06] And I invite you to stand if you would like.
[4170.06 → 4172.06] You don't have to, but you may stand.
[4172.06 → 4173.06] And I invite you to hold out your hands.
[4173.06 → 4176.06] It's a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[4176.06 → 4180.06] And I just want to read from Psalm 121 again.
[4181.06 → 4183.06] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[4184.06 → 4186.06] He will watch over your life.
[4187.06 → 4191.06] The Lord will watch over your coming and you're going both now and forevermore.
[4192.06 → 4193.06] Amen.
[4194.06 → 4198.06] Stay standing if you like, and we'll sing our song, our final song.
[4206.06 → 4225.06] All hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[4225.06 → 4226.06] We sing the Lord of all.
[4226.06 → 4235.06] Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[4236.06 → 4250.06] Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[4250.06 → 4259.02] Let every tongue and every tribe on this terrestrial ball
[4259.02 → 4270.82] To Him, O majesty, us crown and crown Him Lord of all
[4270.82 → 4283.82] To Him, O majesty, us crown Him Lord of all
[4283.82 → 4292.82] O that with all the sacred throne He at His feet may fall
[4292.82 → 4304.82] We'll join the everlasting Son and crown Him Lord of all
[4304.82 → 4318.82] We'll join the everlasting Son and crown Him Lord of all
[4322.82 → 4352.80] We'll join the Son and crown Him Lord of all
[4352.82 → 4382.80] We'll join the Son and crown Him Lord of all
[4382.82 → 4412.80] We'll join the Son and crown Him Lord of all
[4412.80 → 4442.78] Thank you.
